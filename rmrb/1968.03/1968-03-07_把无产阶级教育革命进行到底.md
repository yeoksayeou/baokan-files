Last March, we followed the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and came to Caochangdi Middle School in Chaoyang District, Beijing, to carry out military and political training. Over the past year, we have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of his latest instructions, ensuring that the school's proletarian cultural revolution closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and marches forward to victory. We deeply feel that to do a good job in military and political training, we must firmly uphold the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and focus on the ideological transformation of people.

We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive

Before we entered the school, the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line had not been completely eradicated. There were serious rifts among the students, teachers, and cadres. Fourteen revolutionary mass organizations were divided into two opposing factions, and the "internal war" was endless, with conflicts becoming increasingly sharp. When we entered the school, we faced this complex situation. How should we start with military and political training? Chairman Mao taught us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles." We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and decided to start with class education, focusing on a thorough criticism of the revolution, and deeply cultivating proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. The first class of our military and political training was to guide revolutionary teachers and students to study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and to hold eight bitter struggle meetings in conjunction with this study. After this period of large-scale mass class education, revolutionary teachers and students identified who our enemies and friends were, greatly enhancing their class struggle consciousness, raising their awareness of line struggle, eliminating rifts, and promoting unity.

In mid-March last year, Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive was conveyed to us. We immediately organized a study and discussion session, correcting erroneous thoughts such as "the timing for great unity is not ripe" and "the Tianjin experience is not applicable to Beijing." Revolutionary teachers and students listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Within two days, we took Yan'an Middle School as an example and achieved revolutionary great unity throughout the school based on teaching classes. We then, according to Chairman Mao's teaching that "only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself," correctly treated teachers and cadres, achieving revolutionary three-in-one combination, and began the revolution of resuming classes. At this time, a wave of sabotage was sweeping through society, and students from other schools often came to debate with us. Under the impact of this anarchist trend, some people in the school were influenced. At this time, we organized another study of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, affirming that we were following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, insisting on resuming classes and making revolution, and the overall direction was completely correct. Therefore, we, together with the school's revolutionary committee, carried out education in the entire school to firmly grasp the revolutionary struggle's direction and strongly oppose anarchism. After a month of mass self-education, revolutionary teachers and students recognized the overall direction. Later, although students from outside the school continued to disrupt, revolutionary teachers and students could persuade them with Chairman Mao's instructions, making them leave happily.

We must resolutely follow the path of emphasizing politics

From a year's practice, we have realized that the fundamental task of military and political training is to follow Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings, helping the school's leadership and masses to resolutely follow the path of emphasizing politics.

Chairman Mao taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, helping the school's revolutionary committee to firmly grasp the ideological transformation of the leading cadre group, holding power properly, and using power properly. When the revolutionary committee was first established, due to the influence of the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was rampant, and old and new cadres were not satisfied with each other in their minds, and did not support each other in their work. If these problems were not properly solved, the revolutionary committee could not be consolidated, and the collective leadership role could not be played. In response to these situations, we helped the revolutionary committee to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study, we established a revolutionary learning style, linked it with reality, and actively applied it. The committee members, in addition to insisting on daily reading with revolutionary teachers and students, also established and insisted on the system of collective political study for half a day every week and irregular heart-to-heart talks. Zhang Xixian, the director from a shepherd's background, recalled his bitter childhood, realizing that his "selfishness" was not loyal to Chairman Mao. He took the lead in going to the masses three times to expose his selfishness and fight against it, raising his proletarian consciousness. Deputy Director Zhang Ruizhen, whose mother was ill and needed care, originally planned to drop out of school, but to decide to carry out the educational revolution, decided to continue working and studying at the school.

Over the past year, we have insisted on occupying all positions with Mao Zedong Thought, holding more than 100 various types of reporting meetings, holding 15 types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes within the school, and 36 regular study classes outside the school. In each class, we cultivated and set up a batch of exemplary figures who learned and applied well. Due to the continuous development of the mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students has greatly increased, and their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline have greatly strengthened, with many good deeds emerging.

We must arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses extensively, and carry out the educational revolution. Last June and July, we helped the revolutionary committee to organize revolutionary teachers and students to take Chairman Mao's "May 7" directive as a weapon, carrying out a mass movement to criticize the revisionist educational line. This criticism lasted for more than 50 days, holding more than 30 large and small criticism meetings, writing a large number of criticism articles and big-character posters, launching a fierce attack on the revisionist educational line. Revolutionary teachers and students used their personal experiences to expose the harm of intelligence first, scores first, business first, and admission first. They said: "We are the victims of the revisionist educational line. We must be the critics of the old educational system and the explorers and creators of the new educational system." Based on this criticism, we organized three relatively large-scale on-site social investigations, extensively consulting workers, peasants, cadres, and students' parents, igniting the enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers and students, and firming up their confidence in winning the victory of the educational revolution.

In the military and political training, we paid attention to bringing Chairman Mao's principles and policies on political construction of the army and the glorious traditions of our army to revolutionary teachers and students. We, according to the specific situation of the school, helped the school's revolutionary committee and revolutionary teachers and students to implement the four firsts, grasp living thoughts, and carry out mass ideological and political work. Revolutionary teachers and students learned military affairs, the Three-Eight Style, and the Three Major Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, making the school present a situation of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness, greatly strengthening the revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers and students. In addition, we helped the school to carry out the Four Goods and Five Goods movements and the "One Red Pair" activity, widely forming "One Red Pair" partnerships among revolutionary teachers and students. According to the principle of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," we helped revolutionary teachers and students to break free from the constraints of the old educational system, establishing a new type of teaching relationship where teachers and students combine, jointly go on stage, and teach each other. Moreover, we, according to the spirit of the army's "three democracies," helped revolutionary teachers and students to carry out teaching democracy and evaluation of teaching and learning activities.

We must firmly grasp the ideological transformation of military training cadres

In the process of a year of military and political training, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "to be a good teacher, one must first be a good student" and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings of "to be a part of the revolutionary force and at the same time to constantly regard oneself as the object of the revolution," sincerely learning from the young revolutionaries, constantly overcoming selfish thoughts, correcting mistakes, and seriously transforming our subjective world.

To do a good job in our own ideological transformation, we must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great classroom of class struggle. The process of carrying out military and political training on revolutionary teachers and students is also the process of our constantly overcoming various selfish thoughts and constantly transforming our subjective world. When we first entered the school, we had a relatively common fear of saying the wrong thing and making political mistakes. After the school achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, some comrades had the thought of "military training is over," waiting for the higher authorities to issue the order to withdraw. When we made some progress in our work, some comrades had the emotion of arrogance. All these living thoughts, in summary, are a matter of "selfishness." Whenever these selfish thoughts appeared, we immediately organized all military training personnel to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and related teachings, using the glorious images of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, Old Yu Gong, and Li Wenzhong to compare whether we had done our best to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; whether we had done our best to be "complete" and "thorough" and to the two "extremes"; whether we put ourselves first or the Chinese people and all the people of the world first in the face of a matter. At the same time, we also treated Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and "May 7" directive the same as the "Old Three Articles," learning them as mottos. Through learning, we constantly corrected wrong thoughts and firmed up our resolve to complete the military and political training tasks perfectly.

In the process of military and political training, we always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "the masses are the real heroes," always placing ourselves among the masses, sincerely regarding ourselves as the little students of revolutionary teachers and students. After entering the school, in addition to participating in voluntary labor in the nearby rural areas with revolutionary teachers and students, we often visited students' families, almost visiting each of the hundreds of students' families two to three times. We, with the public of the masses, fought against our selfishness, making every place a classroom and receiving education at all times, constantly touching our souls, and promoting our ideological transformation. We learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, promoting our awareness of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works; we learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students not to forget class bitterness, promoting our further establishment of the resolve to serve the people wholeheartedly for life; we learned from revolutionary teachers and students' deep love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and deep hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line, promoting our enhancement of line struggle consciousness in class struggle.

To firmly fight against the "selfishness" in our minds, we fully carried out democracy, solicited the masses' opinions, listened to the masses' criticisms, and adopted the methods of "going out" and "inviting in," daring to confront and fight against "a flash of thought." The company often held democratic meetings, and mistakes were checked publicly. Everyone realized that only by seriously carrying out self-criticism and correcting mistakes could we gain the trust of the masses and do a good job.

To resolutely complete the tasks given to us by Chairman Mao, we decided to be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and together with the revolutionary teachers and students of Caochangdi Middle School, carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    把无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    北京草场地中学军训营
    去年三月初，我们遵照伟大统帅毛主席的指示，来到北京市朝阳区草场地中学执行军政训练任务。一年来，我们坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，使学校的无产阶级文化大革命紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署胜利前进。我们深深体会到，搞好军政训练，必须坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。
  必须坚定地执行毛主席“三·七”指示
    我们进校前，由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒还未肃清，这个学校的学生、教师、干群之间存在着严重的隔阂。十四个革命群众组织分成互相对立的两派，“内战”打个不休，矛盾越来越尖锐。我们进校后，面对这种复杂局面，军政训练究竟从何入手呢？毛主席教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”我们反复学习了毛主席的教导，决定首先从阶级教育入手，狠抓革命的大批判，把忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情搞得深深的。我们军政训练的第一堂课，就是辅导革命师生学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，并配合这一学习，先后召开了八次忆苦控诉大会。经过这一段时间大规模的群众性阶级教育，革命师生认清了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，从而大大增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了路线斗争觉悟，消除了隔阂，促进了团结。
    去年三月中旬，毛主席的“三·七”指示传达下来了，我们立即组织了学习讨论，纠正了“现在大联合时机不成熟”，“天津的经验对北京不适用”等错误思想。革命师生最听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，两天之内，就以延安中学为榜样，实现了以教学班为基础的全校革命大联合。随即又按照毛主席“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的教导，正确地对待教师和干部，实现了革命的三结合，开始复课闹革命。正在这个时候，社会上刮起了一股拆台风，经常有外校学生来找我们辩论。在这种无政府主义思潮的冲击下，学校中部分人受了影响。这时，我们再次组织学习了毛主席的“三·七”指示，认定了我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持复课闹革命，大方向是完全正确的。因此，我们和学校革命委员会一道，在全校开展了牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向、大反特反无政府主义的正面教育。经过一个来月的群众性的自我教育，革命师生认清了大方向。以后，虽然不断有校外学生来冲击，革命师生都能用毛主席的指示说服他们，使他们高高兴兴地离去。
      必须坚定地走突出政治的道路
    从一年来的实践中，我们体会到军政训练最根本的任务，就是要遵照毛主席和林副主席的教导，帮助学校的领导和群众坚定地走突出政治的道路。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，帮助校革命委员会狠抓了领导班子本身的思想革命化，掌好权，用好权。校革委会刚成立时，由于资产阶级反动路线流毒的影响，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，新老干部思想上互不服气，工作上互不支持。这些问题如不好好解决，校革委会就不能巩固，集体领导作用就不能发挥。针对这些情况，我们帮助革委会举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习中，大立革命学风，联系实际，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。委员们除平时和革命师生一道坚持天天读外，还建立和坚持了每周半日集体进行政治学习和不定期召开交心会的制度。放羊娃出身的主任张希贤，回忆了自己的苦难童年，认识到自己“私”字作怪，不想当第一把手，就是对毛主席不忠。他带头三番五次地到群众中去亮私斗私，提高了无产阶级觉悟。副主任张瑞珍同学，母亲有病需要照顾，本来准备退学，为了决心把教育革命搞好，决定继续留校工作和学习。
    一年来，我们坚持用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，先后共召开各种讲用会一百多次，在校内办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班十五期，校外经常性的学习班三十六个。在各班培养和树立了一批学得好、用得好的典型。由于持续地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，广大革命师生的阶级觉悟大大提高，革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大增强，好人好事大量涌现。
    必须用毛泽东思想武装群众，广泛发动群众，才能大闹教育革命。去年六、七月，我们帮助革委会组织革命师生以毛主席的“五·七”指示为武器，开展了批判修正主义教育路线的群众运动。这次大批判持续了五十多天，共开大小批判会三十余次，写出了大量的批判文章、大字报，向修正主义教育路线猛烈开火。革命师生用切身经历控诉了智育第一、分数第一、业务第一、升学第一对自己的毒害。他们说：“我们是修正主义教育路线的受害者，我们一定要做旧教育制度的批判者和新教育制度的探索者、创造者。”在大批判的基础上，我们又先后组织了三次较大规模的就地社会调查，广泛地向工人、农民、干部、学生家长请教，激发了革命师生的热情，坚定了夺取教育革命胜利的信心。
    我们在军政训练中，注意把毛主席关于政治建军的方针原则和我军的光荣传统，带给革命师生。我们根据学校的具体情况，帮助校革委会和革命师生落实四个第一，狠抓活思想，开展群众性的思想政治工作。革命师生学习军事，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，使学校出现了团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的局面，大大加强了革命师生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。此外，我们还帮助学校开展了四好、五好运动和“一对红”活动，在革命师生中普遍结成了“一对红”对子。按照“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的原则，帮助革命师生冲破旧教育制度的束缚，建立了师生互相结合，同登讲台，互教互学的新型教学关系。另外，我们还按照部队“三大民主”的精神，帮助革命师生开展了教学民主、评教评学活动。
      必须狠抓军训干部的思想革命化
    在一年的军政训练过程中，我们遵照毛主席“要作好先生，首先要作好学生”和林副主席“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”的教导，虚心诚恳地向革命小将学习，不断克服私心杂念，纠正缺点错误，认真改造主观世界。
    搞好本身思想革命化，必须在阶级斗争的大课堂里活学活用毛主席著作。对革命师生实行军政训练的过程，也就是我们自己不断克服各种私心杂念、不断改造主观世界的过程。刚进校时，我们较普遍地存在一个“怕”字，就是怕说错了话，怕犯政治错误。学校实现革命大联合、革命三结合后，一些同志又产生了“军训到头”的思想，等待上级下达撤出的命令。当我们工作中取得一些进展，有些同志又产生了居功骄傲的情绪。所有这些活思想，归结起来就是一个“私”字。每当这些私心杂念一露头，我们就及时组织全体军训人员活学活用毛主席的“老五篇”和有关教导，用张思德、白求恩、老愚公、李文忠等光辉形象，对照我们是不是做到了无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；对照我们是不是做到了“完全”“彻底”和两个“极端”；对照我们一事当前是先替自己打算，还是替中国人民和全世界人民打算。同时，我们还把毛主席的“三·七”指示和“五·七”指示同“老三篇”一样，当作座右铭来学。通过学习，不断纠正了错误思想，坚定了圆满完成军政训练任务的决心。
    在军政训练过程中，我们牢记毛主席的“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，随时置身于群众之中，诚心诚意做革命师生的小学生。进校以后，我们除不断和革命师生一道参加近郊区农村义务劳动外，还经常走访学生家庭，对几百名学生家庭差不多普遍访问了二至三次。我们以群众之公，斗自己之私，处处是课堂，时时受教育，不断触灵魂，推动了我们的思想改造。我们学贫下中农和革命师生对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限深厚的阶级感情，促进了我们活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性；学贫下中农和革命师生不忘阶级苦，促进了我们更进一步树立全心全意为人民服务一辈子的决心；学革命师生无比热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无比憎恨资产阶级反动路线的爱憎分明态度，促进我们在阶级斗争中提高了路线斗争觉悟。
    为了狠斗头脑中的私字，我们充分发扬民主，征求群众意见，听取群众批评，采取“走出去”，“请进来”的办法，敢于刺刀见红，狠斗“一闪念”。排里经常召开民主会，有错就当众检查。大家认识到，只有认真作自我批评，有错就改，才能取得群众的信任，才能做好工作。
    为了坚决完成毛主席交给我们的任务，我们决心谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，和草场地中学的革命师生一道，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
