		Protest Against the Sato Government's Construction of an Airport to Serve U.S. Imperialism's Aggression in Vietnam
		Six Thousand Japanese People Protest Angrily in Narita City
		Protesters Wave "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" Red Flags and Brave the Police in a Fierce Struggle

		New China News Agency, March 11th: According to the Oriental News Agency, on the 10th, six thousand workers, peasants, and students from Chiba Prefecture's Narita City held a large-scale rally and demonstration, strongly opposing the Sato reactionary government's construction of Tokyo's new international airport to serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. They bravely and fiercely fought against the six thousand armed police dispatched by the Sato reactionary government.

		The unyielding and brave struggle of the Japanese revolutionary masses shook Narita City. At the same time, the bloody suppression by the Japanese reactionaries further exposed the fascist nature of the Sato reactionary government.

		In the afternoon of the 10th, more than six thousand farmers from Sanrizuka, young workers, and students from all over the country gathered in Narita City's municipal gymnasium for a protest rally. Afterward, they marched to the Narita City Hall and the airport construction authorities to protest and demonstrate. The airport construction authorities and the police had set up multiple layers of barbed wire and roadblocks around the Narita City Hall since a few days prior. At the city hall entrance, they had also deployed several armored vehicles and a large number of armed police, preparing to suppress the people's anti-American patriotic struggle.

		On the 10th, the police deployed water trucks, using water cannons to attack the protesting farmers, workers, and students. The protesters fearlessly retaliated with stones, cutting through the barbed wire, destroying the roadblocks, and bravely wielding sticks to fight fiercely with the police.

		Sanrizuka Alliance Chairman Tetsuo Muramatsu, who was severely injured during the February 26th struggle, specially came from the hospital to encourage the people's struggle. The protesters, waving countless red flags, surrounded the Narita City Hall for two hours, making the enemy tremble with fear. At the front of the demonstration, a large red flag with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" fluttered in the wind.

		The reactionary armed police went so far as to maliciously launch tear gas and spray tear gas water at the crowd. They also called in more armed police from other places to attack the demonstration from behind. They swung their batons, brutally suppressing the protesters, injuring more than a thousand people and illegally arresting 185 people.

		Subsequently, the protesters held a rally in the gymnasium, strongly protesting the police's fascist atrocities. The angry crowd expressed their determination not to yield to the police's violent suppression and to continue the struggle against the construction of Tokyo's new international airport to the end.

　　反对佐藤政府修建机场为美帝侵越战争效劳
　　日本六千群众在成田市愤怒示威
　　示威群众高举“毛泽东思想万岁！”红旗同警察展开英勇的搏斗
    新华社十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本六千名工人、农民和学生十日在千叶县成田市举行大规模的集会和示威游行，强烈反对佐藤反动政府修建东京新国际机场，为美帝侵越战争效劳的罪恶行径。他们同佐藤反动政府出动的六千名武装警察进行了英勇的激烈的搏斗。
    日本革命群众不屈不挠的英勇斗争，震撼了成田市。同时，日本反动派的血腥镇压，进一步暴露了佐藤反动政府的法西斯真面目。
    十日下午，千叶县三里塚的农民和全国各地来的青年工人、学生等六千多人，在成田市市营体育场举行抗议大会以后，到成田市政府和修建机场当局进行抗议示威游行。修建机场当局和警察当局，从几天以前就在成田市政府附近一带，设下了重重的铁丝网和路障，在市政府门口还配备了几辆装甲车和大量的武装警察，准备镇压群众的反美爱国斗争。
    十日那天，警察出动了水车，用水龙来袭击示威的农民、工人、学生，示威群众毫不畏惧，他们用石头进行还击，把铁丝网剪断，捣毁路障，英勇地挥动棍棒同警察展开激烈的搏斗。
    三里塚反对建设机场同盟委员长户村一作在二月二十六日斗争时被警察打成重伤，这次他特地从医院赶来鼓励群众斗争。示威群众，打着无数面红旗，把成田市政府团团包围两小时之久，使敌人胆战心惊。在示威队伍的前面，写有“毛泽东思想万岁！”大字的红旗迎风招展。
    反动的武装警察竟丧心病狂地向人群施放瓦斯弹，喷射瓦斯水，并从其他地方调来武装警察，从背后袭击示威队伍，他们还挥舞警棍，残暴镇压示威群众，打伤一千多人，非法逮捕一百八十五人。
    接着，示威群众在体育场举行大会，强烈抗议警察的法西斯暴行。愤怒的群众纷纷表示决不屈服于警察的武力镇压，一定要把反对修建东京新国际机场的斗争进行到底。（附图片）
