One day, two U.S. imperialist destroyers, after a period of reconnaissance, intruded into the waters off Guangping Province.

The female militia soldiers on the coastal artillery battery of N Township in Guangping Province saw that the long-awaited opportunity to fight the enemy had arrived. Everyone was excited and full of fighting spirit, ready to give the invading enemy a heavy blow.

The alarm sounded. The female militia soldiers on various battle stations were fully prepared. Political instructor Nguyen Thi Mai spoke through the intercom with a firm and powerful voice, rallying all the female militia soldiers: "Comrades! The people and soldiers of the southern homeland have launched a mighty offensive against the enemy. We must fight bravely, fear no sacrifice, and resolutely punish the U.S. aggressors as they deserve!"

The battle order was issued. The female soldiers fired salvo after salvo of shells at the enemy ships. The first round of vengeful shells from the female militia hit the leading enemy ship. Seeing the situation was dire, the other enemy ship hurriedly turned around and fled.

The brave and tenacious female militia continued to launch fierce artillery attacks on the damaged enemy ship, hitting its stern. Black smoke billowed from the ship. The U.S. imperialist warship finally retreated in defeat, limping away with thick smoke trailing behind.

The battery was filled with the joyous laughter of victory. The female militia soldiers all said to political instructor Nguyen Thi Mai, "Sister Mai! Hurry up and write a letter to report the good news to our southern comrades!"

    女民兵勇揍美舰
    一天，两艘美国强盗驱逐舰，经过一番窥探之后，闯进广平省海面。
    广平省N乡海岸炮兵阵地上的女民兵战士们，眼看盼望已久的杀敌机会已经来到，人人心情振奋，斗志昂扬，准备给来犯的敌人以狠狠打击。
    警报声响起来了。在各个战斗岗位上的女民兵们已经作好了准备。政治指导员阮氏梅通过话机，以坚定有力的声音向全体女民兵战士进行战斗动员：“同志们！骨肉的南方军民向敌人发动了排山倒海的强大攻势，我们必须勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，坚决给予美国侵略者以应有的惩罚！”
    战斗命令下达了。女战士们把一串串炮弹射向敌舰。女民兵的第一轮仇恨的炮弹击中了前面的一艘敌舰，另一艘敌舰见势不妙，慌忙掉头往回逃窜。
    英勇顽强的女民兵连续不断地向那艘被击伤了的敌舰展开猛烈炮击，又击中了敌舰尾部，舰上冒起了黑烟。美国强盗军舰终于败下阵来，灰溜溜地拖着浓烟狼狈逃跑了。
    阵地上洋溢着胜利的欢笑声。女民兵们纷纷对政治指导员阮氏梅说，梅姐！你赶快写信向南方同胞报喜吧！　（据新华社）
