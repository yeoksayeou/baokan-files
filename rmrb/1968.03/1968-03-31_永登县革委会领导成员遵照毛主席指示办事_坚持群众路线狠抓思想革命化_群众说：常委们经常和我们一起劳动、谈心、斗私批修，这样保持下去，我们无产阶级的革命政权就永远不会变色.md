The leading members of the Yongdeng County Revolutionary Committee act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly follow the mass line to promote ideological revolutionization. The masses say: The standing committee members often labor, have heart-to-heart talks, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism with us. If this is maintained, our proletarian revolutionary power will never change color.

The Yongdeng County Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, has focused on the fundamental task of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. By going deep among the masses and accepting their supervision, it has greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre, and the prestige of the Revolutionary Committee among the masses has been increasingly enhanced.

The Yongdeng County Revolutionary Committee was established in December last year. After its establishment, the work was vast and complex, and the leading members were temporarily bogged down in administrative affairs, satisfied with issuing documents and giving instructions, and neglected ideological and political work and their own ideological revolutionization, making the work passive. The revolutionary masses saw this and were anxious. They said: The county Revolutionary Committee does not quickly convey the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Some departments have not well implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and some old and difficult problems have not been solved. The standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee are busy with things that do not match what we want to solve.

After learning about this situation, the Party Committee of the People's Liberation Army support-leftist troops stationed in the area suggested that the county Revolutionary Committee conduct an open rectification among the standing committee members, get out of the administrative circle, and focus on the fundamental task of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. They also suggested that they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly follow the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. The standing committee members of the county Revolutionary Committee accepted the suggestion of the support-leftist troops' Party Committee and immediately organized themselves to go among the masses to solicit opinions. They also brought the masses' opinions back and repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," examining their own thoughts and work. Through study, the standing committee members unanimously recognized that to continuously consolidate and improve the Revolutionary Committee, they must arm the members of the Revolutionary Committee with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong and establish a revolutionary leading cadre that is connected with the masses. From then on, the county Revolutionary Committee strengthened the study of Chairman Mao's works and established the "Daily Reading" system. At the same time, they established a duty system. Every day, except for one or two people on duty at the office, most of the standing committee members went to the countryside, factories, offices, and schools and other grassroots units to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the masses, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee who went to the countryside held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the poor and lower-middle peasants, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and carried out bitter-sweet remembrance activities, promoting the realization of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in all 21 communes in the county, and strongly promoting spring plowing production.

The Yongdeng County Revolutionary Committee got out of the administrative circle, focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, strengthened ideological revolutionization, and the leading members often went deep among the masses, eating, living, laboring, studying, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism with the masses, which was praised by the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. A worker happily said: "The standing committee members of the county Revolutionary Committee often labor, have heart-to-heart talks, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism with us. If this is maintained, our proletarian revolutionary power will never change color." The prestige of the Revolutionary Committee in this county among the masses has been increasingly enhanced, and under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary and production situation in the whole county has been increasingly good.

    坚持群众路线狠抓思想革命化
    群众说：常委们经常和我们一起劳动、谈心、斗私批修，这样保持下去，我们无产阶级的革命政权就永远不会变色
    新华社兰州三十日电　甘肃省永登县革命委员会在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，深入群众，接受群众监督，大大促进了领导班子的思想革命化，革命委员会在群众中的威信越来越高。
    永登县革命委员会是在去年十二月成立的。革命委员会成立以后，工作千头万绪，领导成员一时陷入事务中去，满足于发文件、作指示，忽视了思想政治工作和自身思想革命化，工作被动。革命群众看在眼里，急在心里。他们说：县革委会对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音传达不快，毛主席的最新指示在某些部门还没有很好落实，有些老大难的问题得不到解决，革委会的常委们忙的事与我们想要解决的问题对不上号。
    驻当地的人民解放军支左部队党委了解这一情况后，就建议县革委会在常委中进行开门整风，跳出事务圈子，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，并建议他们遵照毛主席的教导，坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。县革命委员会常委接受了支左部队党委的建议，立即有组织地到群众中去征求意见，并且带着群众的意见，反复地学习“老三篇”，检查自己的思想和工作。通过学习，常委们一致认识到，要不断地巩固和完善革命委员会，就要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命委员会成员，建立起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。从此，县革命委员会加强了毛主席著作的学习，建立了“天天读”制度。同时还建立了值班制，每天除有一二人在机关值班外，绝大部分常委都分头深入到农村、工厂、机关、学校等基层单位中去，和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，落实毛主席的最新指示。到农村的县革委会常委，和贫下中农一起开办毛泽东思想学习班，一起斗私批修，一起开展忆苦思甜活动，促使全县二十一个公社都实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    永登县革命委员会跳出事务圈子，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，加强思想革命化，领导成员经常深入群众，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，受到广大工人、贫下中农的称赞。一位工人高兴地说：“县革命委员会的常委经常和我们一起劳动，一起谈心，一起斗私批修，象这样保持下去，我们无产阶级的革命政权就永远不会变色。”这个县的革命委员会在群众中的威信越来越高，在革命委员会领导下，全县革命和生产形势越来越好。
