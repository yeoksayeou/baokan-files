The Yujiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fangshan County, Beijing, uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide its support for agriculture, helping various production teams implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and doing a solid job of supporting spring plowing.

The Yujiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fangshan County, Beijing, has set up large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, emphasizing proletarian politics, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, helping various production teams implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and doing a good job of supplying spring plowing materials, thus strongly supporting spring plowing.

In early February, as the agricultural preparation peak arrived in the countryside, many problems were continuously reflected in the supply and marketing cooperative. How could the work of supporting agriculture be done well? The practice in previous years was to first understand what each production team lacked and then go to buy what was needed. As long as the goods could be sold by the deadline, the task was considered completed. This year, the revolutionary committee of the supply and marketing cooperative believed that the key to doing a good job of supporting agriculture lay in the revolutionization of people's thinking and in emphasizing proletarian politics. Therefore, they first set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The study class seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on emphasizing politics, summarized their own experiences of emphasizing politics and the lessons of not emphasizing politics, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics and advocating business first, which was promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and another top capitalist-roader within the Party. In this way, the awareness of emphasizing politics among the members of the supply and marketing cooperative was greatly enhanced. Everyone realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are powerful weapons for supporting agriculture. In supporting agriculture, the most important preparation is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought; in supporting agriculture, the most important support is to use Mao Zedong Thought to support. Only by helping the masses implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions can the support materials truly play a role. Everyone decided to fight the economic battle as a political battle.

The revolutionary committee further helped them to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

As soon as the study class ended, the revolutionary committee immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, led by the deputy chairman of the revolutionary committee, to go deep into the communes' production teams for a comprehensive survey and key investigation. They first investigated the situation of the Cultural Revolution and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in each production team, and also investigated the purchasing power of various production teams and some households with different economic conditions. Based on the survey results, they made plans for the procurement and supply of goods. During the survey, they acted as both work teams and propaganda teams, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions wherever they went, and seriously and solidly helping cadres and the masses solve practical problems.

The propaganda team saw that some production teams were not very enthusiastic about preparing for spring plowing, and their preparations were not well implemented. They repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year" and the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing work, mobilizing everyone to make early preparations this year despite the drought, which greatly inspired the cadres and members of these production teams to take immediate action and quickly launched a peak of spring plowing preparations.

The Xitian Dadai Brigade here was affected by production due to the opposition between the two factions. After learning of this situation, the propaganda team immediately went deep into the two factions, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together, inspired the two factions to make more self-criticisms, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, unite as one, and jointly fight the enemy, promoting the great unity of the two factions in thought.

When the propaganda team was in the Xiazhongyuan Dadai Brigade, they found that the newly appointed team leader of the second team lacked experience in leading production and had some impatient emotions. The comrades from the supply and marketing cooperative actively talked to him, studied Chairman Mao's relevant quotations on the mass line with him, and invited old poor peasants, accountants, and cashiers to hold a symposium, mobilizing everyone to help the team leader come up with ideas and solutions. Through the symposium, the team leader was deeply moved.

In previous years, the goods of the supply and marketing cooperative were only managed for delivery but not for use. This year, however, it was different. They first propagated Chairman Mao's teaching of "thrift for revolution" when delivering goods, then explained the characteristics of the goods, the precautions for use, and the methods of preservation. The Xinan Zhang Dadai Brigade had a part of broken hoes. After learning of this, the comrades from the supply and marketing cooperative actively contacted the repair factory to help with the repairs. The comrades from the propaganda team also actively cooperated with the credit cooperative, adhering to the spirit of self-reliance and thrift, and for the production teams or members who lacked money to purchase some necessary agricultural tools and items, the credit cooperative promptly allocated loans, thus strongly supporting spring plowing.

    突出无产阶级政治　大力支援春耕生产
    北京市房山县岳各庄供销社，用毛泽东思想统帅支援农业的工作，帮助各生产队落实毛主席最新指示，把支援春耕生产的工作做得扎扎实实
    本报讯　北京市房山县岳各庄供销社大办毛泽东思想学习班，突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化，帮助各生产队落实毛主席的最新指示，做好春耕物资的供应工作，有力地支援了春耕生产。
    二月初，随着农村备耕高潮的到来，许多问题接二连三地反映到供销社来。怎样才能把支援农业的工作做好呢？往年的做法是先了解各生产队缺什么，然后就去买什么，只要到时能把货推销出去，就算完成了任务。今年，供销社革委会认为：做好支援农业工作的关键在于人的思想革命化，在于突出无产阶级政治。于是，他们首先举办了毛泽东思想学习班。
    学习班认真学习了毛主席关于突出政治的教导，总结了自己突出政治的经验和不突出政治的教训，并以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派所推行的反对突出无产阶级政治，提倡业务第一的反革命修正主义路线。这样，供销社成员突出政治的自觉性大大提高，大家认识到：毛泽东思想是一切工作的指导方针，毛主席的最新指示是支援农业的强大武器。支援农业千准备，万准备，最主要的是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑；对农业千支援，万支援，最重要的是用毛泽东思想去支援，只有帮助群众落实毛主席的最新指示，支援的物资才能真正起到作用。大家决心把经济仗作为政治仗来打。
    供销社成员的认识提高了，革委会又进一步帮助他们活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，斗私批修。
    学习班一结束，革委会立即组织毛泽东思想宣传队，由革委会副主任委员带领，深入公社各生产队，进行了普遍了解，重点调查。他们首先调查了各生产队文化大革命的形势和毛主席最新指示落实的情况，又调查了各生产队和不同经济条件的部分社员家庭的购买力。他们根据调查情况，作了货物采购、供应计划。在调查中，他们既是工作队，又是宣传队，每到一处就大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，认真地、扎扎实实地帮助干部和群众解决实际问题。
    宣传队看到有的生产队备耕生产的劲头不太足，准备工作不够落实，就反复宣传毛主席关于“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩”的教导和中央关于春耕生产工作的指示精神，动员大家在今年天旱的情况下要早做准备，使这些生产队的干部、社员深受启发，立即行动起来，很快掀起了备耕生产高潮。
    这里的天开大队由于两派还闹对立，生产受到一些影响。宣传队了解这个情况后，马上深入到两派群众中去，和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一块斗私批修，启发两派群众各自多做自我批评，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，团结一致，共同对敌，促进了两派思想上的大联合。
    宣传队在下中院大队时，发现新上任的二队队长领导生产缺乏经验，有些急躁情绪。供销社同志就主动找他谈心，和他一块学习毛主席有关群众路线的语录，并找老贫农、保管员、会计一块开座谈会，发动大家帮助队长出主意想办法。通过座谈，队长深受感动。
    往年供销社的货物是管出不管用，今年却不同。他们做到了送货时首先宣传毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，然后讲清货物的特点，使用时的注意事项和保管方法。西南章大队有一部分坏的镐，供销社人员知道后，积极与修配厂联系，帮助修理。宣传队的同志还主动同信用社互相配合，本着自力更生、勤俭建国的精神，对于缺钱购买某些必需农具、物品的生产队或社员，信用社及时拨给贷款，有力地支援了春耕生产。
