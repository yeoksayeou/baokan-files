The heroic people of Albania, under the guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress, have launched a new production drive on all fronts this year, successfully completing the production tasks for the first half of January.

This year marks the third year of Albania's fourth five-year plan. The working people on all production fronts across the country, building on last year's victories, have entered the new battle with full confidence. The state-owned electric power industry company in the capital, Tirana, and the Stalin Textile Combine, among others, have successively completed and overfulfilled the production plans for the first half of January. During the same period, the miners at the Mborje-Drenova coal mine in the Korça region produced over 1,200 tons of coal above the quota. The "November 8" Sugar Factory in this region completed the production plan for the first three months of the year by January 13. The workers at the Mao Zedong Textile Combine in the Berat region overfulfilled the production plan for the first two weeks of January by 3%. The Stalin Machine Factory in this region also successfully completed the production plan. The Elbasan Construction Company overfulfilled the construction tasks for the first half of January by 10%, accelerating the completion date of the Elbasan Cement Plant.

The new victories in production across various industrial and mining enterprises in Albania this year are the result of the broad masses of workers actively implementing the party's correct line and striving for the ideological revolution of the people. Since the beginning of this year, the party organizations in many industrial and mining enterprises have mobilized the broad masses of workers to further implement the policy of self-reliance, tap potential, fully utilize old and waste materials, improve product quality, and reduce production costs, continuously updating the production targets. The Tirana Silicate Brick Factory originally planned to produce 35 million bricks this year, but after mobilizing the masses for discussion, it decided to increase production by another 10 million bricks. The workers of the Joseph Pashko Construction Materials Combine in Tirana, in further realizing the ideological revolution of the people, fully demonstrated the spirit of fearlessness in the face of difficulties, daring to fight against ice and snow and harsh winters, continuously transporting various construction materials to the districts of Fier, Lushnje, and Shkodër. The heroic drivers fearlessly navigate the high and slippery roads, delivering various materials to the vast rural areas, supporting agricultural production.

    新华社地拉那电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在党的五大决议照耀下，今年以来更加积极地在各条生产战线上掀起新的生产热潮，胜利地完成了一月份上半月的生产任务。
    今年是阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划的第三年。全国各生产战线上的劳动人民在去年取得胜利的基础上，都满怀信心地投入新的战斗。首都地拉那国营电力工业公司和斯大林纺织联合工厂等，相继完成和超额完成了一月份上半月的生产计划。同一期间，科尔察区姆博雷—德雷诺维煤矿工人超额生产了一千二百多吨煤。这个区的“十一月八日”制糖厂，一月十三日就已经完成了今年头三个月的生产计划。培拉特区的毛泽东纺织联合工厂职工超额百分之三完成了一月份头两周生产计划。这个区的斯大林机械厂也胜利完成了生产计划。爱尔巴桑建筑公司超额百分之十完成了一月份上半月的建筑任务，缩短了爱尔巴桑水泥厂竣工的日期。
    阿尔巴尼亚全国各地工矿企业今年生产获得新胜利，是由于广大职工积极贯彻党的正确路线和努力实现人的思想革命化的结果。今年以来，许多工矿企业的党组织发动广大工人群众进一步贯彻自力更生的方针，挖掘潜力，充分利用旧料废料，提高产品质量和降低生产成本，使今年的生产指标不断更新。地拉那矽酸砖厂原计划今年生产三千五百万块砖，经过发动群众讨论后决定再增产一千万块砖。地拉那约瑟夫·帕希科建筑材料联合工厂职工在进一步实现人的思想革命化中，充分发扬不怕困难的精神，敢于同冰雪和严冬斗争，把各种建筑材料源源运往费里、卢什涅、斯库台等区。英雄的司机们不怕山高路滑，把各种物资运到广大山区农村，支援农业生产。（附图片）
