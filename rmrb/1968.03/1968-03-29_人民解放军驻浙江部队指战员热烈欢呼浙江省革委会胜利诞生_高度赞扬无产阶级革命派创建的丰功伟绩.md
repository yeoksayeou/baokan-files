Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 28th - The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang warmly celebrate the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and fully implement the series of latest instructions of the great teacher Chairman Mao, to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, the various units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, from headquarters to platoons, from airports and docks to mountain outposts, have been filled with the sound of drums and gongs, cheers, and a festive atmosphere. The soldiers and officers, with hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, carry the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums and gongs, and together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from various places, hold grand celebration meetings to warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They shout a thousand times, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" Many units have also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, mountainous regions, and islands, to convey the good news to the revolutionary masses throughout the province, to propagate the series of latest instructions of Chairman Mao, and to propagate the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the days of warmly celebrating the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the units stationed in Zhejiang review the battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and highly praise the revolutionary spirit and great achievements of the broad proletarian revolutionary forces in the province. The soldiers and officers pointed out that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the series of latest instructions of Chairman Mao, the broad proletarian revolutionary forces in the province have closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, overcome interference from the right and the ultra-left, and waged a tenacious struggle, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are our good examples to learn from. They expressed that they will honestly be the little students of the masses, continuously strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, do the "three supports, two militaries" work better, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, not stopping until complete victory is achieved.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the three services stationed in Zhejiang, following the teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," have expressed that they will definitely seriously implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," and be ready to defend the newly born revolutionary committee and the eastern gate of the motherland. If the enemy comes by water, they will annihilate it in the water; if the enemy comes by air, they will make it disintegrate in the air; if the enemy comes by land, they will make it come and never return. The soldiers and officers of a certain naval unit in Zhejiang, who have been inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao, said: Zhejiang is located on the coastal defense frontline, and class struggle is sharp and complex. We must never forget class struggle, and increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, be ready at any time to annihilate the invading enemy, defend the great socialist motherland, and defend the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers of the unit where the communist warrior Cai Yongxiang was formerly stationed said, the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another victory song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the East China Sea frontline. However, the class enemies will definitely try every means to sabotage and disrupt. We are determined to strengthen the iron-like revolutionary unity with the revolutionary people of the entire province, strengthen the enemy situation awareness, and build an iron wall of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism on the East China Sea frontline, making all daring enemies suffer a crushing defeat. We will definitely fight together with the broad revolutionary masses, win together, and vow to build Zhejiang into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever on the eastern coast of the motherland.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the proletarian revolutionary forces in Zhejiang, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, held a grand meeting at the Hangzhou Youth Palace Square, warmly celebrating another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.
