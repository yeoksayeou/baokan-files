Newly established revolutionary committees should work in what way? The Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has provided some good experiences in this regard.

The Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner was established on October 1, 1967. In the five months since its establishment, it has done a great deal of work, and the revolutionary situation in the entire banner is excellent. The relatively large revolutionary mass organizations have never split into two irreconcilable factions, and revolutionary great unity has been continuously consolidated and developed. Chairman Mao's policy on cadres has been deeply ingrained in people's minds. More than 85% of cadres at all levels in the banner's organs, enterprises, schools, and communes have come forward, with the majority participating in leadership work. From urban areas to vast rural regions, a magnificent movement of revolutionary criticism has been launched. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia and Hangjin Hou Banner have become rats crossing the street, with everyone calling for their downfall. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is flourishing. Nearly 2,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held throughout the banner, with more than half of the 200,000 population participating in the study. Broad masses of rural cadres and commune members, through criticizing and repudiating revisionism, have grasped revolution and promoted production, achieving bumper harvests in agriculture.

Emphasize proletarian politics,
Insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, none of the Party's political tasks can be fulfilled."

From the day of its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner clearly defined its fundamental task: to study, propagate, implement, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, and to arm the 200,000 people of the banner with Mao Zedong Thought. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, to carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people of the entire banner is the politics within politics, the soul within the soul, and the core within the core. Grasping this line means grasping the essence of all work.

When the Revolutionary Committee was first established, all kinds of work surged forward simultaneously. They firmly put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. In October of last year, when the Preparatory Group of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions from his inspection of the three regions, the Banner Revolutionary Committee broadcast the recording throughout the banner that very night, organizing rural cadres and the broad masses of commune members to listen. The Revolutionary Committee also held an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss methods of implementation and execution. The next day, they convened a mass rally via the banner's wired broadcast system. Following this, they held a four-level cadre meeting with over 1,400 participants, arranging for cadres and commune members throughout the banner's cities and rural areas to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word. Subsequently, members of the Revolutionary Committee took the lead, selecting over 700 cadres from various organs and enterprises throughout the banner to form numerous Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which entered the rural areas to propagate, implement, and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

When the Banner Revolutionary Committee was first established, various departments requested two months to separately convene eight specialized meetings to arrange business work. The Banner Revolutionary Committee did not agree to do this but, through the four-level cadre meeting, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, first solving the problem of people's ideology.

As a result, the eight specialized meetings were not held, but because politics took the lead, work in all aspects made significant progress.

At that time, many production team and brigade cadres had the idea of "laying down their burdens and abandoning their responsibilities." After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, these cadres received great education. They said: If poor and lower-middle peasants do not serve as cadres, who will grasp the reins of the proletariat? Who will execute and implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao? Who will implement the Party's policies and directives? Many people put down the burden of "self" and took up the revolutionary responsibility, pushing various tasks forward. For example, at that time, the grain procurement task was only completed by over 60%. After the leading cadres of various production teams and brigades were strengthened, they quickly completed the task.

Through this period of practice, the comrades of the Banner Revolutionary Committee deeply felt: Using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and carrying out the ideological revolutionization of people, one gains leadership and initiative.

Organize a core team,
Propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions

In the 200,000 population of Hangjin Hou Banner, 180,000 are in rural areas. The work focus of the Revolutionary Committee should be placed in rural areas, and it should firmly rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They believed that if the Revolutionary Committee could not quickly and thoroughly convey Chairman Mao's various latest instructions to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, if it did not arm the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and if it did not actively lead the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to win the victory of the rural Cultural Revolution, the entire banner's work would be in vain.

The Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner decided to focus its work on rural areas, paying special attention to quickly conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the rural areas and helping poor and lower-middle peasants to truly understand and implement these instructions.

How to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants? The experience of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner is to use the method of sending down and inviting up to organize a core team, through which to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promote their implementation.

Sending down means selecting all available cadres from the banner and commune levels to organize Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, directly conveying and explaining Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the poor and lower-middle peasants. They study with the poor and lower-middle peasants, jointly researching methods of implementation and execution. Since its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee has sent down three batches of propaganda teams, totaling nearly 3,000 people. This not only made Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household but also helped the broad masses of commune members to correctly understand Chairman Mao's instructions and find methods of implementation. At the same time, they promptly brought up various active thoughts from the masses, allowing the Revolutionary Committee to hear the voices and demands of the masses, so as to formulate effective measures to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Inviting up means the Revolutionary Committee inviting cadre and poor and lower-middle peasant activists who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to the banner, studying, discussing, and understanding the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, exchanging experiences of studying and applying. They have held two such study sessions, with over 2,600 participants. These people, upon returning to their communes, became the core in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The method of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: In the past, cadres sent down only focused on production progress, and those who went up only gave targets and tasks, resulting in frequent "deadlocks." Now, sending down and inviting up both involve studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with us, carrying out the ideological revolutionization of people, which truly grasps the essence and genuinely promotes the revolution and production.

Walk the mass line, set advanced examples

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "In carrying out any work, we Communists must adopt two methods: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of leadership and masses."

The Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner has more than 20 commissioners. Usually, except for one standing committee member handling daily work in the office, the other commissioners all go deep into the grassroots, some to rural areas, some to factories, and some to schools, living with the masses. Their main task is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote the ideological revolutionization of the masses, grasp the active thoughts of the masses, and summarize experiences. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee can handle issues with a clear understanding of the situation, firm resolve, and appropriate methods.

Once Chairman Mao's latest instructions are conveyed, the broad masses create many good experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Because the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangjin Hou Banner often live among the masses, they can promptly discover these experiences, summarize and promote them, using the power of examples to drive the general. They discovered that the "Ulan Muqi" propaganda team of the banner, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, correctly handled cadres and correctly handled the masses, immediately holding a site meeting here, greatly promoting the work of other units in daring to liberate cadres and unite and educate the masses.

In January of this year, the Banner Revolutionary Committee held a site meeting in Hongqi Commune with the participation of cadres from all communes in the banner, promoting the experience of this commune in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which had a significant promotional effect on all communes in the banner. The Fifth Production Team of Bayi Brigade in Sisi Commune originally did not hold study classes well. The representative of this team, after participating in the site meeting, found the gap: the key was that the leadership did not grasp it firmly. Upon returning, they vigorously grasped and promoted the study classes. This production team has a total population of 207, with 105 participating in the study.

In five months, they summarized 17 typical experiences, focusing on how to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to solve practical problems in the unit's struggle, and how individuals can overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, criticize and repudiate revisionism, change their worldview, and promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Starting from class education,
Hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes."

Now, Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Hangjin Hou Banner have become the best battlefield for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the masses. When the masses encounter problems, they are willing to bring them to the study classes to solve. Everyone in the study classes studies Chairman Mao's teachings, uses Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish right from wrong, clarify thoughts, and many problems are quickly solved.

The study classes take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guiding principle, carrying out education on the two classes, two roads, and two lines of struggle, rapidly raising the class consciousness and consciousness of line struggle of the broad masses of commune members.

An important experience of Hangjin Hou Banner in holding good Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to emphasize class struggle education, carry out reminiscence and sweetness activities, and conduct "four reminiscences, four comparisons, and four criticisms."

"Four reminiscences" are: reminisce the bitterness of the old society, reminisce the bitterness of individual farming, reminisce the bitterness of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, and reminisce the bitterness of the capitalist restoration tide.

"Four comparisons" are: compare the sweetness of the new society, compare the sweetness of the socialist collective economy, compare the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and compare the sweetness of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in power.

"Four criticisms" are: criticize the "exploitation is meritorious" and "class struggle is extinguished" theories, criticize the "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package," criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique," and criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Through reminiscing bitterness and sweetness, the broad masses have an even deeper love for Chairman Mao and even greater hatred for China's Khrushchev, further deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and raising their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Criticizing and repudiating revisionism, overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, have become conscious revolutionary actions of the masses.

The "Eastern Red Revolutionary Rebel Joint Committee" of Tuanjie Commune is the earliest rebel organization among the four large mass organizations in the commune, emerging from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have many disagreements with other organizations. After the victory of the struggle, someone proposed implementing revolutionary great unity, but the responsible person of the "Eastern Red" has always disagreed. After reminiscing bitterness and sweetness, he truly understood Chairman Mao's teaching: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." He realized that poor and lower-middle peasants are all on the same vine, with no fundamental conflicts of interest, and not uniting is not listening to Chairman Mao's words. Thus, he actively invited other organizations to jointly solve problems, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

Old poor peasant Zhao Luzi of Hongqi Commune's Lianfeng Brigade, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to solve his son's reluctance to serve as a cadre, called his son to the study class, personally recounting the bitterness of the old society in the study class, greatly educating his son. His son immediately expressed: "Not wanting to serve as a cadre is from the perspective of 'self.' As long as poor and lower-middle peasants still elect me as a cadre, I will definitely grasp power for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, grasp power for poor and lower-middle peasants, and grasp power for socialism."

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, people use Mao Zedong Thought to measure everything, distinguish everything. If what you do conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, you will be praised; if it does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, you will be criticized. What bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, anarchism, selfishness, and other bourgeois goods, all receive criticism here.

Through the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad revolutionary masses have made significant progress on the road of ideological revolutionization. The spirit of "publicness" has been greatly promoted, with everyone for the public and wholeheartedly for the public becoming a new fashion. People's spiritual outlook has greatly changed, and everywhere is a vibrant and enthusiastic revolutionary scene. They sing: "Mao Zedong Thought is truly good, it is the treasure in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must criticize and repudiate the 'self,' and overthrow China's Khrushchev. Grasp the revolution and promote production, learning from Dazhai is the right path!"

    千头万绪抓根本
    ——记内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗革命委员会的工作经验
    新成立的革命委员会，应该怎样工作？内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗革命委员会，在这方面提供了一些好经验。
    杭锦后旗革命委员会于去年十月一日成立。五个月来做了大量的工作，全旗革命形势大好。这里较大的革命群众组织，从来没有分裂成势不两立的两大派，革命的大联合不断巩固和发展。毛主席的干部政策深入人心，全旗机关、企业、学校以及公社以上的干部，已有百分之八十五以上站了出来，其中多数人参加了领导工作。从城镇到广大农村，掀起了波澜壮阔的革命大批判运动。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古和杭锦后旗的代理人已成为过街老鼠，人人喊打。活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动蓬勃发展，全旗举办毛泽东思想学习班近两千期，二十万人口中已有半数以上参加了学习。广大农村干部和社员，通过斗私批修，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取了农业生产的丰产丰收。
    突出无产阶级政治，
    坚持毛泽东思想挂帅
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    杭锦后旗革命委员会从成立的第一天起，就明确规定自己的根本任务是：学习、宣传、贯彻和捍卫毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装全旗二十万人民。用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好全旗人民的思想革命化，这是政治中间的政治，灵魂中间的灵魂，核心中间的核心。抓住这条纲，就抓住了一切工作的根本。
    革命委员会刚成立时，各项工作一齐涌到面前，他们坚定不移地把活学活用毛泽东思想、落实毛主席的最新指示放在一切工作的首位。去年十月，内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组传达毛主席视察三地区的最新指示那天，旗革命委员会连夜把录音向全旗播送，组织农村干部和广大社员群众收听。革命委员会还连夜开常委会讨论贯彻执行的办法。第二天，又召开了全旗有线广播誓师大会。接着，召开了有一千四百多人参加的四级干部会，布置全旗城镇、农村的干部、社员，逐字逐句地学习毛主席的最新指示。然后，由革命委员会成员带头，从全旗各机关、企业抽调了七百多名干部，组成许多支毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村宣传、贯彻、落实毛主席的最新指示。
    旗革命委员会刚成立的时候，各业务部门要求用两个月的时间，分别召开八个专业会议，安排业务工作。旗革命委员会没有同意这样做，而是通过四级干部会，组织大家学习毛主席最新指示，先解决人的思想问题。
  结果，八个专业会议没有开，但是由于政治挂了帅，各方面的工作都有很大的进展。
    当时，不少大队和生产队干部有“放扁担，撂挑子”的思想。这些干部学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，受到很大教育。他们说：贫农、下中农不当干部，谁来掌握无产阶级的印把子，谁来执行、落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，谁来贯彻党的方针政策？许多人放下了“私”字的包袱，担起了革命担子，把各项工作推进了一步。例如，当时购粮任务只完成百分之六十多一点，各生产队、生产大队的领导班子健全以后，加强了领导，很快就完成了任务。
    经过这段时间的实践，旗革命委员会的同志深有体会地说：用毛泽东思想统帅一切，搞好人的思想革命化，就有了领导权和主动权。
      组织好一支骨干队伍，
    宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示
    杭锦后旗二十万人口中有十八万在农村，革命委员会的工作重点应当放在农村，应当坚定地依靠广大贫下中农。他们认为，如果革命委员会不能把毛主席的各项最新指示迅速地全面地同广大贫下中农见面，不用毛泽东思想武装广大贫下中农，不积极领导广大贫下中农去夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，整个旗的工作就会落空。
    杭锦后旗革命委员会确定了把工作重点放在农村，就特别注意把毛主席的最新指示尽快地传达到农村中去，并且帮助贫下中农切实理解、贯彻这些指示。
    怎样才能把毛主席的最新指示落实到广大贫下中农中去呢？杭锦后旗革命委员会的经验，是用派下去、请上来的办法，组织好一支骨干队伍，通过他们去宣传毛主席的最新指示，推动毛主席最新指示的贯彻执行。
    派下去，就是抽调旗、社两级一切可以抽调的干部，组织毛泽东思想宣传队，一竿子插到生产队，直接向贫下中农传达和讲解毛主席的最新指示。他们与贫下中农一起学习，共同研究贯彻执行的办法。革命委员会成立以来，先后派出三批宣传队，近三千人次。这不但使毛主席的最新指示做到家喻户晓，而且帮助广大社员正确地理解毛主席的指示，找出落实的办法。同时，他们及时地把群众中各种活思想带上来，让革命委员会听到群众的呼声和要求，以便有的放矢地制定进一步落实毛主席最新指示的有效措施。
    请上来，就是革命委员会把社队干部和贫下中农中活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子请到旗里来，和他们一起学习、讨论、领会毛主席最新指示的精神，交流活学活用的经验。他们先后开过两次这样的学习会，有两千六百多人参加。这些人回到各社队，成了落实毛主席最新指示的骨干。
    杭锦后旗革命委员会这种做法，受到广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。他们说：过去派下来的干部只是抓生产进度，找上去也只是给指标，给任务，结果常常
  “顶牛”。现在，派下来，找上去，都和我们一起活学活用毛泽东思想，搞人的思想革命化，这就抓到了点子上，真正推动了革命，促进了生产。
      走群众路线，树先进榜样
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”
    杭锦后旗革命委员会有二十多名委员，平时除留下一名常委在机关里处理日常工作外，其他委员都深入基层，有的到农村，有的到工厂，有的到学校，和群众生活在一起。他们的主要任务是宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席的最新指示，促进群众的思想革命化，掌握群众的活思想，总结经验。因此，革命委员会在处理问题时能做到情况明，决心大，方法对。
    毛主席的最新指示一传达下去，广大群众就创造出许多落实毛主席最新指示的好经验。由于杭锦后旗革命委员会的成员经常生活在群众中，他们就能及时发现这些经验，并加以总结、推广，运用榜样的力量去带动一般。他们发现旗“乌兰牧骑”宣传队遵照毛主席的最新指示，正确对待干部，正确对待群众，就马上在这里召开了现场会，大大推动了其他单位大胆解放干部和团结教育群众的工作。
    今年一月，旗革命委员会在红旗公社召开有全旗各社队干部参加的现场会议，推广了这个公社大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，对全旗各社队起了很大推动作用。四支公社八一大队第五生产队，原来学习班办得不大好。这个队的代表参加了现场会，找到了差距：关键是领导抓得不力。回去以后，他们就大抓狠抓学习班。这个生产队总人口是二百零七人，已有一百零五人参加了学习。
    五个月来，他们总结了十七个典型经验，着重总结了如何落实毛主席最新指示解决本单位斗争中的实际问题，以及个人如何打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，斗私批修，改造世界观的经验。这些经验的推广，大大促进了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。
    从阶级教育入手，
        办好毛泽东思想学习班
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”
    现在，毛泽东思想学习班在杭锦后旗已成为活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席最新指示，促进群众思想革命化的最好的阵地。群众遇到问题，都愿意拿到学习班上去解决。大家到了学习班，学习毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想辨别是非，澄清思想，许多问题很快得到了解决。
    学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，进行两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，使广大社员群众迅速提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争的觉悟。
    杭锦后旗办好毛泽东思想学习班的一条重要经验，是突出阶级斗争的教育，开展忆苦思甜的活动，进行“四忆、四比、四批”。
    “四忆”是：忆旧社会的苦，忆单干的苦，忆遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，忆资本主义复辟逆流的苦。
      “四比”是：比新社会的甜，比社会主义集体经济的甜，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，比贫下中农和无产阶级革命派掌权的甜。
      “四批”是：批“剥削有功”“阶级斗争熄灭论”，批“四大自由”“三自一包”，批“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。
    通过忆苦思甜，广大群众对毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨，进一步加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解，提高了贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性。斗私批修，破私立公，成了群众性的自觉的革命行动。
    团结公社“东方红革命造反联合委员会”是公社四个大的群众组织中最早造反的一个，是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中杀出来的。他们同其他组织有不少意见分歧。斗争胜利了，有人提出实行革命大联合，“东革联”的负责人一直不同意。经过忆苦思甜，他才真正理解了毛主席的教导：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”他认识到贫下中农都是一条藤上的瓜，没有根本利害冲突，不联合就是不听毛主席的话，于是主动邀请其他组织一起解决问题，很快实现了革命大联合。
    红旗公社联丰大队老贫农赵路子，学了毛主席最新指示以后，为了解决儿子不想当干部的思想，把儿子叫到学习班，自己在学习班控诉旧社会的苦，使儿子受到很大教育。他儿子当场表示：“不愿当干部是从‘私’字出发。只要贫下中农还选我当干部，我保证为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线掌权，为贫下中农掌权，为社会主义掌权。”
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，人们用毛泽东思想来衡量一切，鉴别一切，你做的事符合毛泽东思想就会受到称赞，不符合毛泽东思想就会受到批评。什么资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，什么无政府主义、自私自利等等资产阶级货色，在这里都受到了批判。
    通过毛泽东思想学习班，广大革命群众在思想革命化的道路上大大前进了一步。“公”字得到了大发扬，人人为公，一心为公成了新的风尚。人们的精神面貌大变，到处是一派生气勃勃、热气腾腾的大好革命景象。他们歌唱道：“毛泽东思想真正好，是我们贫下中农心中宝。‘私’字要批臭，中国赫鲁晓夫要打倒。抓革命促生产，学习大寨是正道！”本报记者
