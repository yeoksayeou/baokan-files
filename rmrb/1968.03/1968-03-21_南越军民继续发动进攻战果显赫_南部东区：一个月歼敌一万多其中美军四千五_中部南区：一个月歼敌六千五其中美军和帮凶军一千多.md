South Vietnamese military and civilians continue to launch attacks with remarkable achievements. In the Southeast region, over ten thousand enemy troops were eliminated in one month, including 4,500 American soldiers. In the South-Central region, 6,500 enemy troops were eliminated in one month, including over 1,000 American soldiers and mercenary troops.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians in the Southeast and South-Central regions of Vietnam South have launched powerful offensives against the enemy from the end of January to the end of February, achieving brilliant results.

In the Southeast region, from January 31 to February 29, the military and civilians eliminated and captured more than ten thousand enemy troops, including 4,500 American invaders. They annihilated six enemy battalions (including one armored battalion) and thirty companies. They also shot down and destroyed nearly two hundred enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed over four hundred military vehicles, including nearly three hundred fifty tanks and armored vehicles, and demolished hundreds of ammunition and fuel depots. Tens of thousands of enemy soldiers and puppet government officials were demoralized, and over one hundred thousand people were liberated.

In the South-Central region, from the night of January 30 to the end of February, the military and civilians eliminated 6,500 enemy troops, including over one thousand American invaders and mercenaries. They demoralized thousands of enemy soldiers, completely annihilated three enemy main force battalions, one armored battalion, and twenty-one companies (including six American companies), and defeated and severely damaged three enemy main force battalions, seventeen companies, one field police unit, and eight "pacification" units. The People's Liberation Armed Forces captured thirty-nine enemy strongholds and outposts, destroyed sixty-six military vehicles, shot down and destroyed over fifty enemy aircraft, destroyed three cannons, burned down seven fuel and ammunition depots, blew up thirty-five bridges, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.
