Revolutionary workers in the salt fields of Liaoning, following Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," have, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, organized extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They have swept away the influence of anarchist thinking, voluntarily observed socialist labor discipline, and launched a production drive for the spring salt harvest.

Workers in the Fu Zhou Bay Salt Field, which has already established a revolutionary committee, have faced three heavy rains and two heavy snows during their spring harvest preparations. Despite these difficulties, they have maintained high spirits and fought against the ice and snow to repair the salt pans and nurture the brine, surpassing previous years' levels. Workers in the Jinzhou Salt Field, which has achieved revolutionary unity by system and unit, have taken Dazhai as their example, firmly established the idea of harvesting salt for the revolution, dared to overcome all difficulties, and continuously set new records in repairing the salt pans and nurturing the brine, making their spring harvest preparations even better.

　　辽宁盐区春晒准备工作做得好
    辽宁盐区的广大革命职工遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在人民解放军帮助下大办毛泽东思想学习班，肃清无政府主义思潮影响，自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，掀起了春晒海盐的生产热潮。
    已经成立革命委员会的复州湾盐场的革命职工，在春晒准备工作中，虽然遭到三次大雨和两次大雪，困难很大，但是，他们始终干劲冲天，情绪饱满，与冰雪斗争，修滩养卤超过了往年水平。已经按系统、按单位实现革命大联合的金州盐场的革命职工，以大寨为榜样，牢固地树立了为革命晒盐的思想，敢于战胜一切困难，修滩养卤不断创造新纪录，使春晒准备工作做得好上加好。
