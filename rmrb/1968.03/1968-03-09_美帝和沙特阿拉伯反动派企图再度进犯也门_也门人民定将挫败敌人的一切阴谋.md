The U.S. imperialists and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries are attempting to invade the Yemen Arab Republic again, unwilling to accept their defeat. The Yemen News Agency recently published a commentary exposing this plot.

The commentary states that the Saudi Arabian reactionaries have already failed in the first phase of the plot devised by U.S. imperialism, which aimed to overthrow the Yemeni republican government and suppress the revolutionary movement in the Arabian Peninsula. The commentary says that the Saudi Arabian reactionaries previously purchased a large number of weapons from the United States and hired mercenaries to attack the Yemeni people. However, many of these American weapons are now in the hands of the Yemeni armed forces. Now, the U.S. imperialists' lackey, Faisal, is purchasing weapons from France, attempting to invade Yemen again, overthrow the Yemeni republican government, and serve his American masters.

The commentary emphasizes: "However, the Yemeni people are stronger than the reactionaries and imperialists. The Yemeni people are confident that their struggle against the reactionaries and imperialists will end in the failure of the reactionaries and imperialists. The Yemeni people will certainly foil all the enemies' plots."

    美帝和沙特阿拉伯反动派企图再度进犯也门
    也门人民定将挫败敌人的一切阴谋
    新华社萨那电　也门通讯社最近发表评论，揭露美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派不甘心于失败，企图卷土重来，再度向阿拉伯也门共和国发动武装侵略。
    评论说，沙特阿拉伯反动派前些时候在执行美帝国主义制定的阴谋第一阶段中已经彻底失败了。这个阴谋就是颠覆也门共和政权，镇压阿拉伯半岛上的革命运动。评论说，沙特阿拉伯反动派过去从美国购买了大批武器，收买雇佣军向也门人民发动进攻，可是，许多美国武器今天已落到也门武装部队的手里。现在，美帝国主义的走狗费萨尔又向法国购买武器，企图再度向也门发动进攻，颠覆也门共和政权，为他的主子美帝效劳。
    评论强调指出：“但是，也门人民比反动派和帝国主义更强大。也门人民深信，他们同反动派和帝国主义的斗争，只会以反动派和帝国主义失败而告终。也门人民必将挫败敌人的一切阴谋。”
