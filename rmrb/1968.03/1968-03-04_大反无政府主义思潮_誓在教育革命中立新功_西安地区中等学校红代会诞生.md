In the midst of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and celebrating the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution, the middle school Red Guards in the Xi'an region triumphantly held their first congress on February 26, officially announcing the establishment of the Xi'an Region Middle School Red Guards Congress. This is a significant achievement for the middle school revolutionary Red Guards in the Xi'an region in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and another victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The young Red Guards in the middle schools of the Xi'an region, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have, over the past year, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, waged a resolute struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shaanxi Province and the Xi'an region, and against the bourgeois reactionary line. They have made immortal contributions to defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were issued, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, taking "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line" as their main task, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to launch a "people's war" against bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism, and anarchist trends. This has promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the middle schools of the Xi'an region. The birth of the Xi'an Region Middle School Red Guards Congress will undoubtedly drive the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the middle schools of the Xi'an region to a new stage.

Responsible comrades from the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee, including Huang Jingyao, Hu Wei, Liu Jianrong, Gu Fengming, and Fang Shengpu, as well as responsible comrades from the troops stationed in Shaanxi, including Liu Zhen, attended the congress. Comrade Fang Shengpu spoke at the meeting, expressing warm congratulations on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee, the Shaanxi Military Region, and all the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Shaanxi. He said, "In sailing the vast ocean, one relies on the helmsman; in making revolution, one relies on Mao Zedong Thought." All the achievements you have made are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Every achievement, every progress, and every victory of yours shine with the invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought. He hoped that the revolutionary Red Guards in the middle schools of the Xi'an region would forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a more extensive and in-depth mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, earnestly run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, link theory with practice, and engage in self-criticism. They should resolutely oppose the anarchist reactionary trend, strengthen proletarian revolutionary discipline, and strive for new achievements in the proletarian education revolution and the struggle for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Representatives from the Xi'an Region Workers' Congress, representatives from the Shaanxi Province Higher Education Red Guards Congress, and representatives from the Xi'an Region Farmers' Congress Preparatory Committee all attended to offer congratulations.

The congress, amidst warm applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

The congress read out the "Resolution on Resuming Classes and Making Revolution" from the First Congress of the Red Guards in Middle Schools in the Xi'an Region.
