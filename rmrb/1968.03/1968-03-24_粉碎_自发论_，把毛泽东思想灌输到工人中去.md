Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao has clearly pointed out: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million. We need a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this ideology, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and a firm and correct political direction." If the working class is not armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, it can only produce trade unionist ideas and cannot produce scientific socialist ideas.

China's Khrushchev is extremely hostile to the great Mao Zedong Thought and extremely afraid of the working masses mastering Mao Zedong Thought. He strenuously opposes infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the working class and desperately opposes and sabotages the mass movement of workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He vigorously advocates the so-called "standardization" and "systematization" of theoretical work, spreading the mysterious view of revolution theory, attempting to exclude the working masses from the door of mastering Mao Zedong Thought. When the great mass movement of workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works surges forward, he stands on the opposite side of this great movement, constantly attacking the workers and peasants studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism." He is desperately trying to extinguish the movement of the masses studying Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to castrate the revolutionary soul of the workers' movement, seize the ideological power of the working class, and lead the workers' movement down the path of trade unionism, making it fall into his trap of restoring capitalism.

"Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." The working class, relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, seized power and achieved liberation. Now, it must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to carry the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end and ensure that the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat will never change color. Without Mao Zedong Thought, the working class that has seized power will lose power. Losing power means the working class loses everything. Therefore, the working masses regard Mao Zedong Thought as their lifeblood and Chairman Mao's great works as food, weapons, and steering wheels. Whether it's low culture, busy production, or lack of historical knowledge, nothing can stop the working masses' boundless enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works. The decisive condition for studying Chairman Mao's works is not these things, but the working class's boundless faith, loyalty, love, and worship of Mao Zedong Thought. Low culture is not a problem, tight time is not a problem, looking up words in a dictionary, asking others to read, and drawing notes while studying are all ways to seize every moment to study. China's Khrushchev wants to let revisionists monopolize the theoretical front, just like the Soviet revisionist scholars who shamelessly distorted Lenin's teachings to serve their restoration of capitalism. This will never succeed! He wants to use the three big sticks of "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism" to oppose the working class using Mao Zedong Thought to transform society and their own souls, which will also never succeed!

Marxist-Leninists have always believed that scientific socialism cannot spontaneously arise within the workers' movement. Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of class struggle both domestically and internationally, reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat, and is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, which cannot spontaneously arise within the workers' movement. For the working class to master Mao Zedong Thought, it must seriously study and delve into Chairman Mao's works and study and delve into Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This studying and delving in is infusing. A true Marxist-Leninist must be an advocate of theoretical infusion and regard infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants as their duty. At the same time, no matter how good the theory is, no matter how correct the ideology is, if it is not infused into the masses, it cannot become a great social practice and cannot be transformed into a tremendous material force. The fundamental method of infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers is to organize the workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao, in a letter to the industrial and transportation front, clearly pointed out: "It is necessary to infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and to transform spiritual force into tremendous material force."

China's Khrushchev, starting from his consistent counter-revolutionary stance of opposing Mao Zedong Thought, strenuously opposes this infusion. He puts on the air of an "authority on mass movements" and, together with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, shouts loudly that studying Chairman Mao's works has become "formalism," advocating to adhere to the "voluntary principle," to accommodate "different interests," and to oppose "social coercion." A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of China's Khrushchev, openly incite that studying Chairman Mao's works should not be "demanded too urgently," "should not mobilize everyone to study," "should not take too many organizational measures," "it is better to have twenty people study voluntarily than to force a hundred people to study," "it is better to have ten people study well than to force a hundred people to study," and so on. China's Khrushchev and his gang's hysterical outburst fully exposes their conspiracy. Originally, what they shout about "formalism" is to oppose everyone studying Chairman Mao's works; what they advocate as the "voluntary principle" and what they criticize as "social coercion" is to not organize and mobilize. From their reactionary standpoint, they cannot understand the workers' masses' urgent desire to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and they cannot understand the workers' masses' urgent desire for the leadership to organize and mobilize the study of Chairman Mao's works.

In a socialist society, there is fierce class struggle. In society, in many corners, the bourgeoisie still exists, and bourgeois ideology, petty-bourgeois ideology, and the old societal forces constantly and insidiously infiltrate the working class. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in society will inevitably be reflected in various ways within the ranks of the working class. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class must transform the entire society in the struggle against the class enemy and the struggle against nature, and in doing so, it must also transform itself. The working class must continuously learn in its work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." We must, according to Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, transform the spiritual outlook of our working class ranks, establish a proletarian worldview of "devoting oneself to the revolution and everything for the revolution." With such a working class, our socialist economic system can continuously develop, the dictatorship of the proletariat can continuously strengthen, the socialist revolution can be carried to the end, and our ultimate goal of communism can be realized.

China's Khrushchev not only opposes Mao Zedong Thought and opposes the workers' masses studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought but also seizes every opportunity to infuse bourgeois ideology into the workers. He vigorously promotes the counter-revolutionary economicism of black goods, advocates material incentives, and promotes personal fame and gain. He entices workers to learn culture and technology for their personal future rather than studying Mao Zedong Thought. He tempts the masses by saying: "Whether in politics or work, this way or that way, it is very difficult. If one truly has a skill, a creation, or an invention, regardless of other things being good or bad, one can be a hero or a model." He emphasizes that for outstanding workers, "their learning of culture and technology should be guaranteed," and they can "not participate in political activities" to focus on studying technology. A small group of capitalist-roaders within the trade union system, understanding his intentions, actually shout that "even excellent workers do not need to read Chairman Mao's books." They openly remove the requirement to "read Chairman Mao's books" from the conditions for excellent workers. What kind of model do they want to set for the working class, and what path do they want to lead Chinese workers down? It is clear as day. Even more sinister is that China's Khrushchev, with his set of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" and "fusion of public and private interests" theories, which are permeated with exploitative class ideology, disguises them in beautiful clothing to corrupt the workers' souls: what is "no personal interest means no collective interest," what is "more work, more pay, more work, more food, more work, more use" is the "unity of personal interests and national interests," and so on. In short, it is to try every means to arouse people's sense of private ownership, develop personal hedonism and selfishness, and carry out "peaceful evolution," leading the workers' ranks down the path of only focusing on work, food, wages, bonuses, labor protection, welfare, promotion, advancement, fame, and family, without asking about politics or national affairs. This is the vicious method used by all Khrushchev-like figures in the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat to conspire to seize the Party and the country, restore capitalism.

Advocating the "spontaneity theory" is a consistent trick used by all revisionists, traitors, and scoundrels to sabotage the workers' movement. From Bernstein to the Russian "Economists," and up to the Khrushchev traitor and scoundrel clique, not one of them is not a fervent advocate of the "spontaneity theory." China's Khrushchev is no exception in this regard; he has always been a "spontaneity theorist." As early as the democratic revolutionary period, he wanted the workers' movement to "take the workers' daily economic demands as the slogan for mobilizing the workers" and opposed "adding political slogans and political demands to the workers' economic demands"; he fervently praised spontaneous struggles by the masses, ranting about how "one must, and mainly, rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses." Since national liberation, he has again brought out this bourgeois "theoretical weapon," attempting to strangle the mass movement of workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, making the workers' movement deviate from the revolutionary track of Mao Zedong Thought, and adapting to his counter-revolutionary needs of restoring capitalism, which is a heinous crime. We must thoroughly expose and overthrow this counter-revolutionary revisionist "spontaneity theory."

Loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the essence of our working class and the great task bestowed upon us by the times. The workers' movement must always regard infusing Mao Zedong Thought as its fundamental task. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seize the thorough victory of the socialist revolution, and realize our working class's highest ideal—the great historical mission of communism. Look to the future of the world, hold high the red flag and march forward! China will definitely be a new China of red Mao Zedong Thought! The world will definitely be a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought!

### 粉碎“自发论”，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人中去

    粉碎“自发论”，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人中去
    全国总工会“大联委”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志明确指出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”工人阶级如果没有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的武装，只能产生工联主义的思想，不可能产生科学社会主义的思想。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极端仇视伟大的毛泽东思想，极端害怕职工群众掌握毛泽东思想。他竭力反对向工人阶级灌输毛泽东思想，拚命反对和破坏职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他竭力鼓吹理论工作的所谓“正规化”、“系统化”，散布对革命理论的神秘观点，妄图把工人群众排斥在掌握毛泽东思想的大门之外。当广大职工活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的历史潮流滚滚向前的时候，他更是站在这个伟大运动的对面，不断攻击工农群众活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”。他这样疯狂地企图扑灭群众学习毛泽东思想的运动，就是要阉割工人运动的革命灵魂，在思想上夺工人阶级的权，把工人运动引上工联主义的邪路，使之落入他复辟资本主义的圈套。
    “没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”。工人阶级依靠伟大的毛泽东思想夺取了政权，得到了翻身。现在还要靠毛泽东思想把无产阶级专政下的革命进行到底，保证无产阶级专政的国家永不变色。离开了毛泽东思想，取得政权的工人阶级，就会丧失政权。丧失了政权，工人阶级也就丧失一切。因此，工人群众把毛泽东思想看作是自己的命根子，把毛主席的伟大著作看作是粮食、武器和方向盘。什么文化低、生产忙、没有历史知识，统统不能阻挡工人群众学习毛主席著作的无限热情。学习毛主席著作的决定条件不是这些，而是工人阶级对毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限热爱和无限崇拜。文化低不怕，时间紧也不怕，查着字典、请别人念着、画着画当笔记也要抓紧一切时间学习。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想让修正主义分子垄断理论阵地，如象苏修御用学者那样丧心病狂地篡改伟大列宁的遗训，来为他们复辟资本主义效劳。万万办不到！他妄想用“简单化”、“庸俗化”和“形式主义”三根大棒，反对工人阶级用毛泽东思想改造社会、改造自己的灵魂，更是万万办不到！
    马克思列宁主义者历来认为，科学社会主义不可能在工人运动中自发产生。毛泽东思想反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级的根本利益，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，不可能在工人运动中自发地产生。工人阶级要掌握毛泽东思想，就必须认真地学习和钻研毛主席著作，学习和钻研毛主席的最新指示。这种学习和钻研就是灌输。真正的马克思列宁主义者必定是革命理论的灌输论者，并且把向工农群众灌输毛泽东思想作为自己的天职。同时，再好的理论，再正确的思想，如果不灌输到群众中去，就不能变成伟大的社会实践，就不能转化为巨大的物质力量。向职工灌输毛泽东思想，根本的方法，就是组织职工活学活用毛主席著作。林彪副主席在写给工交战线的一封信中，明确地指出：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫从他一贯仇视毛泽东思想的反革命立场出发，竭力反对这种灌输。他摆出“群众运动权威”的架势，和党内另一个最大的走资派一唱一和，大喊大叫学习毛主席著作出现了“形式主义”，叫嚷要坚持“自愿原则”，照顾“不同兴趣”，反对“社会强制”。一小撮反革命修正主义分子在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，公开出来煽动说，对学习毛主席著作不要“要求过急”，“不要动员人人学习”，“不要采取过多的组织措施”，“强迫一百人学习，不如二十人自愿学”，“宁要十个人学得好，不要一百人强迫学”，等等，等等。中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，这样歇斯底里大发作，正好暴露了他们的阴谋。原来他们所叫嚷的“形式主义”，就是反对人人学习毛主席著作；他们所鼓吹的“自愿原则”，所指责的“社会强制”，就是不要组织发动。他们从自己的反动立场出发，根本无法理解职工群众迫切要求活学活用毛主席著作的心情，无法理解职工群众迫切要求领导上发动和组织学习毛主席著作的心情。
    社会主义社会存在着激烈的阶级斗争。在社会上，在许多角落里，资产阶级还存在，资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想和旧社会的习惯势力，还经常地、无孔不入地向工人阶级进行侵袭。社会上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争必然会通过各种途径反映到工人阶级队伍中来。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”我们必须按照毛主席的光辉思想，改造我们工人阶级队伍的精神面貌，树立“一心为革命，一切为革命”的无产阶级世界观。有了这样一支工人阶级队伍，我们的社会主义经济制度才能不断发展，无产阶级专政才能不断加强，社会主义革命才能进行到底，我们的最终目的共产主义才能实现。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不仅自己反对毛泽东思想，反对职工群众活学活用毛泽东思想，而且抓紧一切机会向工人灌输资产阶级思想。他大肆推销反革命经济主义的黑货，大搞物质刺激，鼓吹个人名利。他引诱工人为了个人前途去学文化，学技术，而不要学习毛泽东思想。他诱惑群众说：“政治上也好，工作上也好，这样也好，那样也好，是很难的。如果真有一门本事，真有一种创造，真有一种发明，不管其他好不好，就可以是英雄或者模范”。他强调对优秀工人“要保证他们学习文化技术”，可以“不让他们参加政治活动”，以便钻研技术。工会系统中的一小撮走资派心领神会，竟然大喊“五好职工也不能要求都读毛主席的书”。他们公然把“读毛主席的书”的要求从五好职工条件中一刀砍去。他们究竟要给工人阶级树立什么样板，要把中国工人带到一条什么道路上去，不是昭然若揭了吗？更为恶毒的是，中国赫鲁晓夫把他那一套“吃小亏，占大便宜”、“公私溶化论”等等浸透了剥削阶级思想的黑货，披上美丽的外衣，拿来腐蚀工人的灵魂：什么“没有个人利益即无整体利益”呀，什么“多劳多得，多劳多吃，多劳多用”是“个人利益和国家利益的一致性”呀，等等，等等。一句话，就是千方百计唤起人们的私有观念，发展个人享乐主义和自私自利思想，大搞“和平演变”，把工人队伍带上只顾干活、吃饭、工资、奖金、劳保、福利、升级、提拔、成名、成家，不问政治、不管国家大事的歧途上去。这是在无产阶级专政的国家里，一切赫鲁晓夫式的人物，阴谋篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义所惯用的恶毒手法。
    鼓吹“自发论”是一切修正主义分子、工贼、叛徒破坏工人运动的一贯伎俩。从伯恩施坦到俄国“经济派”，一直到赫鲁晓夫工贼叛徒集团，没有一个不是“自发论”的狂热吹鼓手。中国赫鲁晓夫在这方面也毫无逊色，他从来就是一个“自发论”者。早在民主革命时期，他就要工人运动“以工人的日常经济要求作为动员工人的口号”，反对“在群众经济要求上加上政治口号和政治要求”；他狂热地颂扬群众自发斗争，胡说什么：“必须、而且主要是依靠群众的自发运动”。全国解放以来，他又搬出这个资产阶级的破烂“理论武器”，妄图扼杀职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，使工人运动脱离毛泽东思想的革命轨道，而适应其复辟资本主义的反革命需要，真是罪恶滔天。我们必须把这个反革命修正主义的“自发论”彻底批臭，彻底打倒。
    忠于伟大领袖毛主席、忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，是我们工人阶级的本质，是时代赋予我们的伟大任务。工人运动永远要把灌输毛泽东思想作为自己的根本任务。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，夺取社会主义革命的彻底胜利，实现我们工人阶级的最高理想——共产主义的伟大历史使命。放眼世界看未来，高举红旗向前进！中国必定是红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新中国！世界必定是红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！
