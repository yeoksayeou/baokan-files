The soldiers of the unit and the local workers and peasants, when they mention the medical team of a certain chemical defense unit, they praise it highly, saying: "They truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers with all their hearts and souls!"

This medical team is praised because they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, study Chairman Mao's works, and focus on the "use" aspect, learning a little and applying it immediately. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, insisting on a path that emphasizes proletarian politics, facing the troops, facing the workers and peasants, caring for the people's suffering, and genuinely serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

They have long insisted on going to the troops for medical rounds, wherever the troops go, medical supplies follow; they treat the workers and peasants as their responsibility, responding to all requests and providing door-to-door medical services; they turn the medical process into a process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." The growth of this medical team has also gone through such a process.

Following Chairman Mao's Instructions, Focusing Medical Work on the Troops

Three years ago, this medical team was seen by the soldiers as a "wait-for-the-sick-to-come" hospital. The soldiers severely criticized their bureaucratic style.

The question was clear: Should we emphasize proletarian politics, face the troops, and serve the soldiers, or should we stay in the medical team and be bureaucratic doctors? To solve this problem, the Party branch organized everyone to study and apply the "Three Articles" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other brilliant works, using Chairman Mao's thoughts on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as a weapon, launching a great debate among the medical staff. Chairman Mao's words are like a mobilization order, a spiritual atomic bomb with boundless power. Through the debate, everyone realized: The core issue of medical work is the question of whom to serve. "The question of whom to serve is a fundamental and principled question." As a military medical team, the first thing is to face the troops and serve the soldiers.

Once the thinking was clear, everything fell into place. Everyone unanimously decided to focus medical work on the troops. They immediately formulated measures, stipulating that for direct-subordinate companies, headquarters, and families, they would conduct medical rounds every other day; for distant companies, they would conduct regular medical rounds, visiting each battalion for a week every month. They carried their backpacks and medical kits and walked out of the medical team. This unit's base is scattered, with the nearest being a few or ten miles away, and the farthest being over three hundred miles. No matter how far, they persisted year-round, climbing mountains and crossing rivers without interruption.

Medical rounds are just the beginning of facing the troops, not the entirety; they can only meet the general needs of troops on fixed missions, but cannot meet the various needs of troops on the move or executing mobile tasks. Therefore, the Party branch further proposed that, in addition to medical rounds, the team should always keep one-third of its personnel in the troops. When the troops go on maneuvers or execute mobile tasks, the team would leave only a few people on duty at home, with the rest all going with them. At that time, the troops were about to go on a military maneuver, and the twenty-plus medical personnel of the medical team all went to the front line. Only one doctor and one medical assistant were left at home for outpatient duty. They not only persisted long-term in medical rounds and accompanying the troops (wherever the troops go, the medical personnel follow) but also, when the battalion and company medical personnel were sick or went home, they immediately sent people to replace them, ensuring continuous medical care and delivering medicine to the doorstep.

At first, some comrades went down to the troops, but their minds did not follow. They still started from improving technology, focusing on treatment over prevention, focusing on difficult cases over common diseases, and even studying books in the troops. The facts told them: Going down to the troops means the mind must go down to the troops. If the mind does not go down to the troops, it is still detached from reality and the masses, and cannot well serve the soldiers. The Party branch organized everyone to review Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" and "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods," using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against selfishness. The more selfishness is fought, the more loyal one is to Chairman Mao, and the more class feelings one has for the soldiers. They decided to take root in the troops, like the comrades in Xingguo County, creating "first-class work," thinking what the soldiers think, urgently addressing what the soldiers need, and feeling what the soldiers feel. They set three tasks for themselves in the troops: one is to grasp the thoughts of the battalion and company medical personnel, two is to grasp the prevention of infectious diseases, and three is to grasp the treatment of common diseases. To do a good job in preventing and treating common, prevalent, and universally existing diseases, they went deep into the troops according to different seasons, working, training, and producing with the cadres and soldiers, focusing on the kitchen, toilets, and personal hygiene. Every time they went to a company, they would drop their medicine bags, and if they encountered meal preparation, they would roll up their sleeves and go to the kitchen; if they encountered company production, they would roll up their pants and go to the fields; if they encountered company training, they would tighten their belts and roll with the soldiers, conducting investigations from the "five together" (eating, living, laboring, associating, and fighting together), discovering diseases from the investigations, finding the roots, and then taking action to actively prevent and treat them.

Once, military doctor Wan Qixin went to the company for medical rounds. In the evening, during bed checks, he found that squad leader Liu Zhongxiao was breathing with his mouth open. Wan Qixin felt very sad, thinking: "In the past, we sat in the medical team waiting for the sick to come, letting comrades work with illnesses. How can this be called wholeheartedly serving the people?" The next morning, he went to find Liu Zhongxiao and learned that he had chronic rhinitis, which he had not been able to treat properly due to work. Wan Qixin immediately took him to the medical team for surgery, and he quickly recovered. They found and treated several common diseases such as dental caries, chronic rhinitis, and chronic tonsillitis. They timely relieved the soldiers' pain. When they found that the kitchen had many flies and the utensils were not properly disinfected, they helped the company find the cause, kill the flies, and handle the feces harmlessly. Medical assistant Wang Yamin went to the 8th Company for a work point, knowing that the company had previously had an outbreak of dysentery, he conducted investigations inside and outside the battalion, finding eight causes. To eliminate flies, he personally led the soldiers to tighten the soil within fifteen meters around the toilets. This way, the maggots that had already burrowed into the soil were killed, and those that had not burrowed in would not easily burrow in. Over the years, due to good preventive work, the incidence rate in this unit has been decreasing year by year. The soldiers happily said: "The medical team really thinks of us thoroughly!"

Following Chairman Mao's Instructions, Wholeheartedly Serving the People

After the medical team focused its work on the troops, they faced a new problem: there were fewer people at home, but many people from the surrounding areas came for treatment. Should they treat them or not? Some comrades said: "We are military doctors, and we have few hands, we can't take on so much extra burden!"

Regarding the people's request for treatment, is it considered an "extra" burden or an internal responsibility? The Party branch organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Rectify the Party's Erroneous Ideas," discussing this issue. Comrades compared Mao Zedong's military thought and the idea of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and reached the correct conclusion: We are the people's army, serving the people is the starting point of all our work. "All practical problems of the masses are problems we should pay attention to." Serving the people is limitless, treating the masses is our internal responsibility, and being busy is also appropriate!

The comrades of the medical team followed Chairman Mao's instructions, treating the people who came for outpatient care promptly; the people did not leave until they were treated, the doctor did not go off duty, and the pharmacist did not close the door until the patient took the medicine. One noon, the off-duty call had already been blown, and medical assistant Zhang Hua was about to take off his work clothes to eat, but a community member came to ask for a tooth extraction. He immediately invited the patient to the treatment room and performed the surgery. It happened to be a long-rooted tooth, and it took more than two hours to extract. When he sent the community member away, the on-duty call sounded again. Their selfless spirit deeply moved the people who came for treatment.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A correct understanding often needs to go through multiple repetitions from matter to spirit, from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to understanding, from understanding to practice." The situation of the medical team is exactly like this. The Party branch organized the comrades to discuss such a problem: Regarding treating the masses, only accepting them when they come to the door and not willing to go to them, is it "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people? After discussion, everyone realized: They should start from the convenience of the masses, and if the masses come to ask, they should go out to treat them; if the masses do not come to ask, they should also find ways to go to them. Later, the medical team set two rules for themselves: one is to respond to all requests. If the masses come to ask for a doctor, as long as there is someone at home, they will immediately go out to treat them; if they encounter a serious illness, they will do their best. One is to focus on medical rounds. For production teams with infectious and prevalent diseases, they designate a person to contact them, conduct regular medical rounds, and during busy farming seasons and seasons with many diseases, they send out propaganda teams to propagate and investigate, organizing disease prevention.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they bravely advance, breaking through obstacles. As the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people is further established, the number of people the medical team treats for the workers and peasants increases year by year. Although treating the masses has exceeded treating the troops, the workload has increased significantly, but they see this as the people's trust in our army, and it is also their responsibility in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They proudly say: "Mao Zedong Thought as the soul, completely and thoroughly serving the people, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance, no matter how heavy the burden."

Being a Good Doctor of Chairman Mao, Enthusiastically Propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. The comrades of the medical team rely on Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and have made a fundamental change in their medical style. They are not only medical workers but also propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past, some comrades had this idea: treating diseases is the doctor's responsibility, and doing ideological work is the political workers' job. Once, a new soldier came for treatment, and the doctor found that he had some ideological issues. Originally, a talk could solve it, but this doctor called the platoon leader of their company, asking them to strengthen the soldier's ideological work, and passed the buck.

This incident raised a question for the comrades of the medical team: Why are we treating diseases? Treating diseases without caring about ideology, is it "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people? The Party branch seized this issue and organized everyone to discuss it.

In the discussion, comrades used the method of comparison to talk about two incidents: One was performing an appendectomy on a soldier. The soldier heard that he needed surgery and was a bit nervous. The doctor thought: Treating diseases is also a test of a person's revolutionary will, and we should help the soldier overcome difficulties and achieve victory. He studied Chairman Mao's teaching with the soldier, "This army has an indomitable spirit, it wants to overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies," telling the soldier to face the disease with the spirit of overcoming the enemy. Immediately, the soldier's fear was replaced by a firm and brave spirit, and the surgery was successfully performed. Another incident was performing a boil incision and drainage surgery on a community member. It was a very simple minor surgery, but because ideological work was not done in advance to eliminate fear, the patient fainted as soon as the surgery began, not only affecting the treatment but also affecting the patient's future mental state.

Helping people means helping their hearts, treating diseases means treating the root. Everyone realized from these two incidents: Doctors do not treat diseases for the sake of treating diseases, but for the sake of revolution. To "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, we must care for comrades' physical health and even more for their ideology. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul.... Ideological and political work, every department must take responsibility." Everyone decided to be doctors who emphasize politics.

Once, military doctor Shi Chengquan came to the 6th Company's maneuver and heard that a platoon had many sick soldiers dropping out during the march. During the exercise, he marched with this platoon, and after in-depth investigation, he found that some comrades dropped out mainly because of poor endurance. After returning to the camp, it happened to be August 1st, and Shi Chengquan, with the support of the company's cadres, gave a report on the glorious traditions of our army to everyone.

Once, medical assistant Wu Ruting went to a production team to treat an elderly poor peasant woman. The old woman said she often had headaches and could not sleep at night. After investigation, it was found that the old woman often missed her son who was in the army. Wu Ruting thought: This old woman's illness cannot be cured just by medical treatment, but also by using Mao Zedong Thought to help her broaden her mind. So, he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the old woman, talking and exchanging ideas, telling her: The People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary big family, a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, and the cadres and soldiers "care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Your son in the army is the same as us, you can rest assured. The old woman thought about Chairman Mao's teachings and looked at the soldiers in front of her, happily saying: "The army led by Chairman Mao is good, the cadres care for the soldiers, and everyone helps each other. I must quickly write a letter to my son and tell him to do a good job and defend Chairman Mao." The old woman's mood brightened, and after more than ten acupuncture treatments, she recovered.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the comrades of the medical team even more closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Whenever Chairman Mao issued a call, they immediately propagated it, whether it was outpatient or medical rounds, whether it was at the base or outside, as long as they encountered the masses, they propagated; when they encountered problems, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve them. A female community member from Zhangfang Brigade suddenly became mute and came to the medical team for treatment. It was learned that this female community member, because she did not want her husband to be a cadre, had an argument with her husband, her nerves were stimulated, and she suddenly became mute. According to this situation, medical assistant Ju Qingqi, while giving this female community member acupuncture, repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," guiding her to consciously fight selfishness, igniting a revolution in her soul, broadening her mind, and after a few acupuncture treatments, she recovered from her mutism. Later, the comrades of the medical team also went to her home, studying the "Three Articles" with her husband and wife, recalling bitterness and sweetness together, criticizing the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev on the cadre issue together, greatly raising her awareness, and firmly establishing her husband's confidence in being a good cadre. She actively examined her own selfish thoughts, excitedly telling the comrades of the medical team: "You cured my disease and used Mao Zedong Thought to help me fight selfishness. You are truly good doctors of Chairman Mao."

From practice, the comrades of the medical team further felt the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, their enthusiasm for propagating Mao Zedong Thought increased, and their awareness of doing ideological work became stronger. They treated patients, visited wards, and went out for treatment, everywhere they actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Before treating patients, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions according to the patients' moods; during treatment, they used Chairman Mao's teachings to talk with the patients; after treatment, they sent a quotation from Chairman Mao according to the patients' concerns. They not only turned the entire treatment process into a process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought but also treated the troops, villages, and factories as battlefields for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They said, tasks are important, very important, but propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the most important; responsibilities have many, but propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the first.

    毛泽东思想化灵魂　完全彻底为人民
    ——记防化学兵首次活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会先进集体某部卫生队
    连队的战士和驻地的工农群众，提起防化学兵某部卫生队，就赞不绝口地说：人家可真是全心全意、完全彻底为工农兵服务啊！
    这个卫生队所以受到赞扬，是因为他们无限忠于毛主席，学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，学一点用一点。他们遵照毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，坚持走突出无产阶级政治的道路，面向连队，面向工农，关心群众的疾苦，真心实意地为工农兵服务。
    他们长年坚持到连队巡诊，部队走到那里，医药送到那里；他们把给工农群众看病当成自己份内的责任，有求必应，送医上门；他们把医疗过程当成宣传毛泽东思想的过程。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”这个卫生队的成长也正是经历了这样一个过程。
    听毛主席的话，把医疗的重点放在连队
    三年前，这个卫生队在战士的心目中，只是一所
  “等病上门”的医院。战士们严厉地批评过他们的老爷作风。
    是突出无产阶级政治，面向连队，为兵服务，还是蹲在卫生队，当老爷医生？这个问题尖锐地摆在他们面前。为了解决这个问题，党支部组织大家活学活用“老三篇”、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作，以毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想为武器，在医护人员中展开了一场大辩论。毛主席的话，一句就是一道动员令，就是一颗威力无穷的精神原子弹。通过辩论，使大家认识到：卫生工作的核心问题，是一个为什么人服务的问题。“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”作为部队卫生队，首先就是要面向连队，为兵服务。
    思想通了，一通百通，大家一致确定把卫生工作的重点放在连队。他们立即制定了措施，规定对直属连队、机关、家属，隔天巡诊；对外地的连队定期巡诊，每月每个营巡诊一个星期。他们背着背包，挎上药箱，走出了卫生队。这个部队驻地分散，近的相距几里、十几里，远的三百多里。不管多远，他们长年如一日，爬山涉水从不间断。
    巡诊，只是面向连队的开始，而不是面向连队的全部；它只能适应固定执行任务的连队的一般需要，而不能满足部队野营和执行机动任务的连队的各种要求。于是，党支部进一步提出，除巡诊外，全队经常保持三分之一的人在连队。部队野营或执行机动任务时，全队只留极少数人员在家值班，其余全部随行。当时，部队正好要外出军事野营，卫生队的二十多名医务人员，全部出动，奔赴第一线，家里只留下一个医生、一个卫生员值班门诊。他们不仅长期坚持了巡诊和随行（即连队到那里，医务人员跟到那里）等制度，而且当营、连医务人员生病或探家时，他们便马上派人去顶替，做到了连队不断医，医药送上门。
    开始，有的同志人下去了，思想没有跟上来，仍然从提高技术出发，重医疗轻预防，重疑难病轻常见病，甚至在连队关起门啃“本本”。事实告诉他们：人下连首先要思想下连，思想不下连，照样脱离实际、脱离群众，不能很好地为兵服务。党支部组织大家重温毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗“私”字。斗掉一分私心，就对毛主席多一分忠诚，就对战士多一分阶级感情。他们决心扎根连队，象兴国县的同志那样，创造“第一等的工作”，想战士所想，急战士所需，痛战士所痛。他们为自己下连队规定了三条任务：一抓营、连卫生人员的思想，二抓传染病的预防，三抓常见病的治疗。为了搞好常见病、多发病、普遍存在的疾病的防治工作，根据不同季节，深入连队，和干部战士一起野营、训练、生产，狠抓伙房、厕所和个人卫生。他们每到一个连队，药包一撂，遇上做饭时，卷起袖子就下伙房；遇到连队生产，卷起裤腿就下田；遇上连队训练，扎紧腰带就同战士们一起摸爬滚打，从“五同”中作调查，从调查中发现疾病，找出根源，然后亲自动手，积极进行预防和治疗。
    一次，军医万齐鑫到连巡诊，晚上查铺时，发现班长刘忠孝张着嘴呼吸，万军医心里很难受，心想：
  “过去我们坐在卫生队等病上门，让战友带病工作，这怎能叫全心全意为人民服务呢！”第二天一大早他就去找刘忠孝，一了解知道他患慢性鼻炎，因为工作忙一直没有好好治，万军医当即把他请到卫生队，给他动了手术，很快就好了。他们前后发现龋齿病、慢性鼻炎、慢性扁桃腺炎等常见病七、八种，都迅速进行了治疗，及时解除了战士们的病痛。当他们发现伙房苍蝇多，食具消毒不严时，就亲自帮助连队查原因，灭蝇子，进行粪便无害化处理。医助王艳民到八连蹲点，根据这个连队曾有痢疾病流行的情况，经过营内外各方面调查，找出了八条原因，为了消灭苍蝇，他亲自带领战士，把厕所周围十五米内的土一点一点地砸紧。这样，就使已经钻进土里的蛆被砸死，还没有钻进去的蛆就不容易钻进去了。几年来，这个部队由于预防工作做得好，发病率逐年下降。战士们高兴地说：“卫生队真为我们想得周到啊！”
        照毛主席指示办事，全心全意
    为人民群众服务
    卫生队把工作重点摆到连队以后，又面临着一个新的问题：家里人少了，可是，驻地周围来求诊的群众很多。接诊还是不接诊？有的同志说：“我们是军医，人手又少，不能再捞这么些份外负担了！”
    对于人民群众求诊，是看成“份外”的负担，还是当作份内的责任呢？党支部又组织大家学习《为人民服务》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，围绕这个问题展开讨论。同志们用毛主席的建军思想和“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的观点一对照，便得出了正确的结论：我们是人民的军队，为人民服务是我们一切工作的出发点。“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”为人民服务是无限的，给群众治病是我们的份内责任，忙一点也是应该的！
    卫生队的同志遵循毛主席的教导，对来门诊的群众，做到了随来随诊；群众不看完病，医生不下班，病员不取走药，司药不关门。一天中午，下班号已经吹了，医助张华正要脱掉工作服去吃饭，又来了一位社员要求拔牙。他毫不犹豫地把病员请到医疗室，立即进行手术。碰巧，又遇上个长根牙，一直抠了两个多小时。当他把这个社员送走的时候，上班号又响了。他们这种忘我的精神，深深感动了来求诊的群众。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。”卫生队的情况也正是这样。党支部组织同志们讨论过这样一个问题：对群众看病，只接受人家送病上门，不愿去送医上门，算不算“完全”“彻底”？经过讨论，大家认识到：应该从方便群众出发，群众来请应该出诊，群众不来请也应该设法送医上门。后来卫生队为自己规定了两条制度：一条是有求必应。群众来请医生，只要家里有人就立即出诊；如果碰到急病，则全力以赴。一条是重点巡诊。对有传染病和多发病的生产队，指定专人联系，经常巡诊，每逢农忙和多发病季节，派出宣传组，一边宣传一边调查，组织疾病预防。
    毛主席指示记在心，披荆斩棘向前进。随着“完全”“彻底”为人民服务思想的进一步树立，卫生队给工农群众看病的人数逐年增加，虽然为群众看病已经超过了为部队看病的人数，工作量大大加重，但他们把这看成是人民群众对我军的信任，也是自己对无产阶级文化大革命应尽的一份责任。他们豪迈地说：“毛泽东思想化灵魂，完全彻底为人民，毛主席挥手我前进，担子再重也觉轻。”
    做毛主席的好医生，热情向群众宣传毛泽东思想
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。卫生队的同志就是靠毛泽东思想，靠突出无产阶级政治，在医疗作风上来了一个根本的转变。他们既是医务工作者，又是毛泽东思想宣传员。
    过去，有的同志抱着这样一个观点：看病是医生的责任，做思想工作是政治工作人员的事情。有一次，一个新战士来看病，医生发现他有些活思想，本来谈一谈就可以解决，可这位医生打电话给他们连的指导员，要他们加强对这个战士的思想工作，一推了事。
    这件事给卫生队的同志们提出了一个问题：我们到底是为什么而治病？光管治病不管思想，是不是作到了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务？党支部抓住这个问题，组织大家讨论。
    在讨论中，同志们用对比的方法，谈到了这样两件事：一件是给一个战士做阑尾手术，战士听说要开刀，有点紧张。医生想道：治病，也是对一个人革命意志的锻炼，应该帮助战士战胜困难，取得胜利。就同这位战士一起学习毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，告诉战士要以压倒敌人的精神来对待疾病。顿时，战士的畏惧心理被坚定勇敢的精神所代替，顺利地进行了手术。另一件是给一个群众做疖子排脓手术。本来是个很简单的小手术，但由于事先没有做思想工作，消除畏惧心理，结果一动手术病人就晕过去了，不仅影响了治疗，还影响了患者日后的精神状态。
    帮人要帮心，治病要治根。大家从这两件事认识到：医生不是为治病而治病，是为了革命而治病。要做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，就要既关心同志们的身体健康，更关心同志们的思想。毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。……思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。”大家决心要做突出政治的医生。
    有一次，军医石成泉来到六连野营，听说有个排病号较多，行军掉队。在演习中，他就同这个排一起行军，经过深入了解，有的同志掉队，主要是坚持性较差。回营以后，正好赶上“八一”节，石成泉就在连队干部的支持下，给大家作了一次我军光荣传统的报告。
    一次，卫生员武入廷到生产队给一位贫农老大娘看病。大娘说，她经常头痛，晚上睡不着觉。经过了解，老大娘经常想念在外当兵的儿子。武入廷同志想：大娘这个病，单靠医疗不行，还要用毛泽东思想帮助老人家开阔胸怀。于是，他同大娘一起学习《为人民服务》。一边学习，一边谈心，告诉她：人民解放军是革命的大家庭，是毛泽东思想的大学校，干部战士“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”，你儿子在部队跟我们一样，尽可放心。大娘想想毛主席的教导，看看眼前的解放军，高兴地说：“毛主席老人家领导的部队就是好，干部关心战士，大伙互相帮助。我得赶快写信告诉我的儿子，叫他好好干，保卫毛主席。”大娘的心情一开朗，只经过十多次针灸，病就好了。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，卫生队的同志更是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极宣传毛主席的最新指示。毛主席发出号召，他们就立即宣传，不管是门诊还是巡诊，无论在驻地还是外出，只要遇到群众，他们就宣传；碰到问题，他们就用毛泽东思想为武器去解决。张坊大队一个女社员突患哑症来卫生队就诊。据了解，这个女社员因为不愿丈夫当干部，和丈夫吵了嘴，神经受了刺激，突然哑巴了。根据这种情况，卫生员剧青岐，一边给这位女社员针灸，一边反复向她宣传毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，引导她自觉地斗私，在灵魂深处爆发革命，开阔了她的胸怀，经过几次针灸，哑病就好了。后来，卫生队的同志还到她家里，和他们夫妻一起学习“老三篇”，一起忆苦思甜，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，大大地提高了她的觉悟，还坚定了她丈夫当好干部的信心。她主动检查了自己一事当前，先替自己打算的错误思想，激动地对卫生队的同志说：“你们治好了我的病，还用毛泽东思想帮我斗掉了私心，你们真是毛主席的好医生。”
    从实践中，卫生队的同志们进一步体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，宣传毛泽东思想的热情越来越高，做思想工作的自觉性越来越强。他们看病、查房、出诊，处处活学活用毛主席著作。看病前针对病员的情绪，先学毛主席的指示，看病中用毛主席的教导和病员谈心，看病后根据病员要注意的问题，再送一条毛主席语录。他们不仅把整个治疗过程变成宣传毛泽东思想的过程，而且把连队、农村、工厂都当成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。他们说，任务千重要，万重要，宣传毛泽东思想最重要；职责有千条，有万条，宣传毛泽东思想是第一条。
