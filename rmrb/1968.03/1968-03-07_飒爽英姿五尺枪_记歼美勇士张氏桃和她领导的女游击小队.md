American aggressors once launched a "dry season counteroffensive." Among them, a large contingent of thousands of invading troops was defeated by a small guerrilla squad consisting of just four women. This female guerrilla squad was in Quang Nam province, with Zhang Meitang, a 20-year-old girl who had experienced countless battles, as its leader.

One day, Meitang was about to go to the market with a basket. Suddenly, she heard that the enemy was about to launch a "sweeping operation." She should have immediately returned home, but thinking of her responsibility, she quickly borrowed a bicycle from someone and rushed to the market. Meitang walked from one end of the market to the other, carefully scouting the enemy's situation. On her way back home, Meitang asked herself, "The enemy is so numerous, should we fight or retreat?" She then resolutely answered herself, "Fight! We must fight!" Upon returning home, Meitang immediately gathered three female guerrilla squad members to prepare for battle.

Along the field ridges, the female guerrilla squad quickly occupied their positions. As soon as they jumped into the trenches, they heard the crisp sound of gunfire from the village entrance. This was the male guerrilla squad members engaging the enemy who had entered the village. Meitang looked at her comrades and said firmly, "The enemy has arrived. We must fight them fiercely! For a long time, we have been waiting for the opportunity to fight the American devils. Now that the enemy has come to our doorstep, what are we waiting for?" Seeing Meitang's resolute and calm demeanor, the sisters became even more determined, all saying, "Meitang is right. We must become heroes who annihilate the Americans!"

It was already past noon, and although everyone had not yet eaten, they remained at their posts, ready for battle.

Around one o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy appeared. The trenches echoed with the gunshots of the female snipers. In this short moment, Meitang and the other three female guerrilla fighters continuously fired at the enemy, knocking down eight American devils. The enemy panicked and used heavy machine guns to continuously mow down the area, while also calling in aircraft and artillery for support. However, the enemy did not expect the guerrilla fighters to be so close to their own soldiers, causing the bombs to fall far behind the trenches. After a round of bombardment, the American aggressors' infantry began to advance, but were again stopped by the bullets of the female guerrilla squad members. The enemy's artillery became even more fierce, flying towards the positions, kicking up dirt, smoke billowing, branches breaking, and leaves falling, with explosions shaking the entire trench.

Facing this situation, the sisters decided to hold their ground and not retreat. The enemy's two charges were repelled, so they changed tactics to encircle them. At this time, Meitang firmly said, "The enemy wants to surround us, so we must fight even more fiercely!" The enemy's heavy artillery and eleven aircraft continued to bombard the positions, filling the trenches with smoke, and the pungent smell of explosives permeated the area. But this only further ignited the female guerrilla fighters' resolve to bravely fight for the liberation of the south and the defense of the motherland. The sisters continuously and tensely changed positions, fiercely shooting at the exhausted enemy. By around three o'clock in the afternoon, the four female guerrilla squad members had successfully repelled the attack of thousands of enemy troops and completed their ambush mission.

    飒爽英姿五尺枪
    记歼美勇士张氏桃和她领导的女游击小队
    美国强盗有一次发动“旱季反攻”。其中有支拥有成千名侵略军的大队人马竟被四名妇女组成的小小游击队击败了。这支女游击队在广南省，队长张氏桃是一位身经百战、年方二十的姑娘。
    一天，阿桃提着箩筐刚要去赶集。忽然，听说敌人要出来“扫荡”了，她本应马上回家，可是想起自己的责任，就立刻从别人那里借来一辆自行车，飞也似地奔向市场。阿桃从市场这头走到那头，仔细地侦察敌情。在回家的路上，阿桃自问道：“敌人这么多，是打还是撤？”她接着刚强地回答自己：“打！决心打！”回到家，阿桃立即召集了三位女游击队员，准备战斗。
    沿着田埂，女游击队迅速地占领阵地。当她们刚跳进工事，就听到村头响起了清脆的枪声，这正是男游击队员们和进村的敌人交火了。阿桃望着战友坚定地说：“敌人来了，狠狠地打！很久以来，我们就盼望着要打美国鬼子，这次敌人自己送上门来，我们还等什么呢！”看到阿桃坚定泰然的神情，姐妹们更加坚决了，都说：“桃姐说得很对，我们一定要做歼美勇士！”已经过了晌午，虽然大家还没有吃饭，但是她们仍坚守岗位，准备迎战。
    下午一点多钟，敌人出现了。工事里响起了女射手们的枪声。在这短短的时刻，阿桃和其他三位女游击战士向敌人连续射击，一连打倒了八个美国鬼子。敌人着了慌，他们用重机枪不停地扫射，同时还召来飞机和大炮进行支援。可是敌人没有料到游击战士和他们自己的士兵相距那样近，以致炸弹都落在战壕后面远远的地方去了。一番轰炸之后，美国强盗的步兵开始进攻，可是又被女游击队员的子弹挡住了。敌人的炮弹更加猛烈地飞向阵地，翻起土块，烟尘滚滚，枝折叶碎，爆炸撼动了整个战壕。
    面对这样的情况，姐妹们决心坚持战斗不后退。敌人的两次冲锋都被击退，于是，又改用包围的办法。这时，阿桃坚定地说：“敌人妄图包围我们，我们更要猛打！”敌人的重炮和十一架飞机继续向阵地狂轰滥炸，整个战壕硝烟弥漫，炸药浓烈的臭味充塞着阵地，但这只能更加激发女游击战士为解放南方、保卫祖国勇敢战斗的决心。姐妹们不断紧张地更换着位置，向疲惫的敌人猛烈射击。到下午三点多钟，四位女游击队员终于击退了成千名敌人的进攻，胜利完成狙击任务。
