Two thousand Pakistani workers and students protest against the South Rhodesian colonial authorities' massacre of African freedom fighters

	New Delhi, March 13 — Kenyan and Ethiopian students held protests and marches to strongly condemn the recent brutal killing of five Zimbabwean freedom fighters by the Smith colonial regime in South Rhodesia, backed by British imperialism.

	On March 12, in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, more than two thousand students held a massive protest march in front of the British High Commissioner's office. The protesting students held up signs with slogans such as "Hang the butcher Smith and Wilson!" and "The blood of the Zimbabwean people must be avenged with blood!" They shouted angrily at passing British colonialists, "Go back!" The protesting students also demanded to take up arms and fight alongside the people of Zimbabwe against the Smith colonial regime.

	The protesting students submitted a protest letter to the British Deputy High Commissioner. The angry students also threw tomatoes and garbage at this British official. The Kenyan students' just actions were met with suppression by Kenyan police. The police dispatched mounted units in an attempt to disperse the protesting students, but the students persisted in their struggle and fought back in self-defense.

	On the same day, in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, more than two thousand Ethiopian students held a protest march to denounce the brutal atrocities of the South Rhodesian colonial authorities. The students expressed their willingness to join the fight against the Smith colonial regime at any time.

	The protesting students went to the British Embassy in Ethiopia to protest against the British imperialists' instigation of the South Rhodesian colonial authorities to kill Zimbabwean freedom fighters. When the British Ambassador was forced to come out of the embassy, the students threw stones at him. The students also fought against the armed police who came to suppress them.

	According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Rawalpindi on March 13, the Pakistani newspaper "Dawn" reported: On March 7, more than two thousand workers and students held a protest march in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan, to protest against the savage killing of African freedom fighters by the reactionary regime in South Rhodesia. The marching protesters held up banners and signs with slogans such as "Hang Smith," "Hang Wilson," "British imperialism is the murderer of the African people," "Down with American imperialism and British imperialism," and "Support the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people for independence."
