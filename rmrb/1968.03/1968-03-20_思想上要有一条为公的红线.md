	One Must Have a Line of Public Spirit in One's Mind
	Representative of the Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works at the Railway Corps, Female Trainee Assistant Engineer Zhaojinling

	In August 1965, I finished my school life and came to the Railway Corps. The leadership assigned me to a squad as a female soldier. In the first few days, it rained continuously, and the path from the company to the construction site was as slippery as glass smeared with oil. I slipped and fell more than ten times on a single trip. The rocks in the tunnel seemed to be grinning, as if they were about to fall and crush me. All this felt like a bucket of cold water poured over me, and thoughts of fearing hardship and worrying about danger arose.

	I opened the red book "Old Three Articles" and studied it repeatedly, engaging in a fierce struggle in my mind. Looking at the soldiers, they were like little tigers, rushing to the most difficult places and the most dangerous spots. Why couldn't I do the same? I thought: the soldiers are good in every way, and it all comes down to one "public" character. With a heart for the public, one fears neither hardship nor death. I, on the other hand, am lacking in this "public" spirit. With a "selfish" heart, one fears hardship and even more fears death. To build a steel transportation line, one must first build a revolutionary red line of public spirit in one's mind.

	"The Old Three Articles" is a golden broom that sweeps away selfishness and a powerful weapon for transforming one's worldview. I studied and applied "The Old Three Articles" diligently, fighting against "selfishness" and striving to climb the peak of "public spirit." One day, a flood washed away a temporary bridge, and it needed to be repaired urgently. At that time, the cold wind was howling, and the rain was pouring. Should I participate in this battle or not? I am a female comrade and don't have a raincoat. If I don't go, comrades won't blame me. But I thought, if I don't go, it would be a defeat in the battle against selfishness and for public spirit. People like me should go to the most difficult and dangerous places to temper ourselves. So, I jumped into the raging waters with the soldiers, carrying wooden baskets and loading stones, rushing to repair the bridge. We stood in the water and fought for over four hours, and together with everyone, we repaired the bridge. Another day, I and three comrades were reinforcing the supports in the tunnel that had been bent by a cave-in. At that time, several supports were creaking under the pressure of the cave-in, and the walls on both sides of the tunnel were collapsing. Facing the danger, my heart started to race. But the soldiers, regardless of the gravel hitting their bodies, continued to clear the stones and set up the supports without hesitation. Seeing this, I felt a bit ashamed. I thought: my heart racing was due to selfishness, and selfishness must be eliminated. So, I loudly recited, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory," and together with the comrades, I lifted the wooden beams and cleared the stones, supporting the frames.

	This is how I fought while working and worked while fighting, gradually reducing the ground of selfishness and expanding the territory of public spirit. I will definitely carry out this battle against selfishness and for public spirit to the end, striving to build a revolutionary red line of public spirit in my spiritual world.

　　思想上要有一条为公的红线
　　铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、女见习助理技术员　赵金岭
    一九六五年八月，我结束了学校生活，来到铁道兵部队。领导上把我分配在班里当一名女战士。刚到那几天，阴雨绵绵，从连队到工地，象玻璃板上擦黄油，又滑又泞，我来回走了一趟，摔了十几跤。隧道里的石头呲牙咧嘴，象要掉下来砸到我。这一切，象一盆冷水泼到我的身上，害怕艰苦、担心遇到危险的思想活动起来了。
    我打开红色宝书“老三篇”，反复学习，思想上展开了激烈的斗争。看看战士们，真象小老虎一样，那里艰苦往那里去，那里危险往那里冲，为什么我就做不到呢？我想：战士们千好万好，就好在一个
  “公”字上。一心为公，才能一不怕苦，二不怕死。我千差万差，就差在“私”字上。有了“私”字，就既怕苦，更怕死。要想修通一条钢铁运输线，必须首先在自己的思想上筑通一条一心为公的革命红线。
    “老三篇”是扫除私心的金扫帚，是改造世界观的强大武器。我就狠学狠用“老三篇”，向“私”字开炮，努力往“公”字的高峰上攀登。有一天，山洪把一座便桥冲断了，需要火速抢修。这时，寒风呼啸，大雨下个不停。参加不参加这场斗争呢？我是个女同志，又没雨衣，不去，同志们也不会责怪我。但是我又一想，不去的话，就是在破私立公的战场上打了个败仗。象我这样的人，就是要到最艰苦、最危险的地方去锻炼。于是，我就和战士们一块跳到激流之中，抬木笼，装石头，奋力抢修。站在水里战斗了四个多小时，和大家一起把便桥抢修好了。还有一天，我和三个同志在隧道里加固被塌方压歪了的排架。当时有几个排架被塌方压得吱吱作响，导坑两侧也一股劲地塌着。面对着险情，我又有些心跳。可战士们不管砂卵石打在身上，仍然毫不犹豫，拚力地把石碴扒开，把柱子一根根立起来。看到这种情景，我脸上有些发烧，我想：我的心跳又是“私”心在跳，“私”字露头必须歼灭它。于是，我大声念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”和同志们一块抬木头，扒石碴，把排架支撑起来。
    我就是这样边斗边干，边干边斗，“私”字地盘愈来愈小，“公”字阵地愈来愈大。我一定把这场破私立公的战斗进行到底，努力在精神世界里筑起一条一心为公的革命红线。
