Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of women in Japan have shown extraordinary courage in their struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, Soviet revisionists, and the Rengoseki revisionist clique. Whether it was the struggle against the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier, the struggle against Prime Minister Sato's visit to the United States, or the struggle against U.S. military bases, they have all made outstanding contributions.

In the foothills of Mount Fuji in Yamanashi Prefecture, women have been engaged in a heroic struggle for twenty years against the U.S. military and the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" seizing farmers' land for a shooting range. Local farmers have raised slogans such as "Do not allow Fuji Mountain's land to be used as a base for invading and attacking the Chinese mainland!" and "Do not let the U.S. imperialists use Fuji Mountain's land to invade Vietnam!" They continue their struggle with the revolutionary spirit of "Moving Mountains" taught by Chairman Mao. The "Mothers' Association" in the area has played a significant role in the struggle. They often ride horses, marching proudly to the U.S. military shooting range to demonstrate. During the U.S. military and Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" shooting exercises, women have repeatedly staged sit-in protests, disrupting their plans.

Women in Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka have organized women's action teams in their struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries building a military airport. They actively participated in the fierce anti-imperialist, patriotic, and just struggle. On February 26, the Sato reactionary government sent a large number of armed police to brutally suppress and attack the farmers of Sanrizuka and Japanese patriotic youth students who came to support the struggle. The women of Sanrizuka were fearless. They transported stones to the youth students to use as "ammunition" against the police and also threw stones at the police themselves, giving a powerful blow to the Japanese reactionaries.

Japanese women have come to realize in their anti-imperialist struggle the truth that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. They have waged an unyielding struggle against the Rengoseki revisionist clique. Recently, the Rengoseki clique staged an anti-China farce in Kyoto. This small group of flies is terrified and hates the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They viciously attacked a Japanese bookstore that specializes in selling Chinese books and promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This despicable act infuriated the revolutionary people of Kyoto. The revolutionary people of Kyoto, who love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, engaged in a head-on struggle with the Soviet revisionists. In this struggle, the revolutionary women of Kyoto actively participated in distributing and posting leaflets, exposing the crimes of the Japanese revisionists. A female photographer who had previously exposed the Rengoseki clique, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's teaching, "Resolve to make sacrifices, dare to face difficulties, and overcome all obstacles to win victory," fearlessly faced the harassment and threats of the Japanese revisionists. Using her camera as a weapon, she day and night persisted in the struggle on the front lines, capturing the ugly faces of the Japanese revisionists and exposing their counter-revolutionary crimes, causing them to panic and be at a loss. This female photographer said, Chairman Mao's teachings are the source of my courage and strength in struggling against the Rengoseki clique. Mao Zedong Thought has shown me the direction of the struggle.

Japanese revolutionary women strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their struggles, using Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle and the driving force for their ideological revolution. Now, there are many women in Japan who participate in various study groups of Chairman Mao's works, and many places have established study groups and classes composed of women to study Chairman Mao's works. In Osaka, there is a Mao Zedong Thought study class composed of women. They study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together three afternoons a week. Among them, some can already recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune" fluently.

A young woman said: Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I deeply realized that Japan's current situation of being invaded, controlled, and oppressed by U.S. imperialism must be changed. The Japanese people must struggle to oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to achieve liberation, and only in this way can Japanese women achieve liberation. Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the guiding light for the Japanese people.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下
    日本革命妇女在同帝修反斗争中作出卓越贡献
    据新华社东京六日电　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，日本广大妇女在反对美日反动派、苏修和宫本修正主义集团的斗争中，表现得十分英勇。无论是反对美国核航空母舰的斗争，还是反对佐藤卖国首相访美的斗争，以及反对美国军事基地的斗争，她们都作出了出色的贡献。
    在富士山麓的山梨县，妇女们同驻日美军和日本“自卫队”霸占农民土地做打靶场的罪恶行径，坚持了长达二十年之久的英勇斗争。当地农民提出
  “不准把富士山的土地作为侵略和进攻中国大陆的基地！”“不让美帝把富士山的土地用于侵略越南！”等战斗口号，并以毛主席教导的“愚公移山”的革命精神继续坚持斗争。那里的妇女组织“母亲之会”在斗争中发挥了很大的作用。她们常常骑着马，雄赳赳气昂昂地到美军打靶场进行示威。在美军和日本“自卫队”进行射击演习时，妇女们多次展开静坐斗争，使它们的演习计划一再破产。
    千叶县三里塚的妇女们，在反对美日反动派修建军用机场的斗争中组织了妇女行动队，积极地投入了激烈的反美爱国正义斗争。二月二十六日，佐藤反动政府派出大批武装警察野蛮镇压和袭击三里塚的农民和前来支援斗争的日本爱国青年学生。三里塚的妇女面无惧色，她们运送石块给青年学生作为反击警察的“子弹”，并且自己也向警察投掷石块，有力地惩罚了日本反动派。
    日本广大妇女在反帝斗争中认识到反帝必须反修的真理，她们同宫本修正主义集团进行了不屈不挠的斗争。最近，宫本集团在京都导演了一出反华丑剧。这一小撮可怜的苍蝇对光焰无际的毛泽东思想怕得要死、恨得要命。他们对一家专售中国书籍、宣传毛泽东思想的日本书店疯狂地进行破坏和捣乱。他们的这一无耻行径激起了京都革命人民的极大愤怒。无限热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想的京都革命人民同日修分子展开了针锋相对的斗争。在这一场斗争中，京都的革命妇女积极投入了散发和张贴传单、揭露日修分子罪行等活动。一位曾经大造宫本集团反的女摄影家，在毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导鼓舞下，不怕日修分子的包围和恐吓，以照相机为武器，日夜坚持在斗争现场，把日修分子的丑态一一拍摄下来，并且洗印出来广为公布，狠狠地揭露了宫本集团的反革命罪行，使他们大为惊慌和狼狈不堪。这位女摄影家说，毛主席的教导是我同宫本集团进行斗争的勇气和力量的源泉，毛泽东思想给我指明了斗争方向。
  日本革命妇女们在斗争中努力活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想作为行动的指针和思想革命化的动力。现在，日本有许多妇女参加了各种学习毛主席著作小组，还有不少地方成立了由妇女组成的毛主席著作学习会和学习班。在大阪有一个由妇女组成的毛泽东思想学习班。她们每星期利用三个中午时间在一起学习“老三篇”。她们当中有人已经能够熟练地背诵《为人民服务》。
    一位青年妇女说：通过学习毛主席著作，深刻地认识到日本受美帝国主义侵略、控制和压迫的现状必须改变。日本人民要通过斗争，反对美帝国主义及其走狗，才能获得解放，而只有这样，日本妇女也才能获得解放。毛泽东思想将永远是日本人民行动的指南。
