According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Tirana, local newspapers reported that the people of Dibra and Librazhd in Albania, who suffered a severe earthquake on November 30 last year, quickly eliminated the disaster caused by the earthquake. They continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, welcome the new high tide of spring production this year, and strive for greater development in agriculture and animal husbandry.

At the beginning of the new year, the party branches, cooperative management committees, and village people's assemblies of the agricultural cooperatives in Dibra held various meetings to discuss the situation and set tasks. The enthusiasm of the members for production is soaring. At present, the fields are filled with slogans written on banners, and everywhere presents a revolutionary scene of vigorous activity. The members, who have just recovered from the injuries caused by the earthquake, immediately reviewed and revised the production plan for this year, determined to exceed the original plan by producing an additional 100,000 piculs of grain.

To expand the irrigation area, the members of Dibra are working hard to dig the 12-kilometer-long Mehri irrigation canal and the 8-kilometer-long Shina irrigation canal in the cold and snowy season. By the end of January this year, the members had completed one-third of the project. The entire project is expected to be completed by May, when another 1,000 hectares of land will be irrigated.

In January, the climate in Librazhd was changeable, with strong winds, snow, and rain. The members overcame all difficulties, turned winter idleness into winter busyness, and actively went up the mountains to open up wasteland. The area's land reclamation tasks for this year and next year have already been completed. The Floc agricultural cooperative in the deep mountains reported good news at the end of last year: it completed the land reclamation task of the fourth five-year plan three years ahead of schedule. Now, 90% of the members of the entire cooperative go up the mountains every day to open up wasteland, expand the cultivated land area, and strive to sell surplus grain to the state this year.

From last November to this January, the Dibra area, located in the mountains, experienced continuous strong winds and heavy snow. The cooperative members braved the wind and snow every day, clearing snow and opening up wasteland, and building terraces in the mountains, hills, and valleys of Glopold, Rur, and Korab. They are determined to complete the entire land reclamation task of the fourth five-year plan by the end of this year.

While striving for a bumper grain harvest this year, the members of these two areas also pay special attention to animal husbandry production.

    发扬自力更生艰苦奋斗革命精神　争取农牧业更大发展
    迪勃拉等区农业生产一片热气腾腾
    据新华社地拉那电据这里的报纸报道，去年十一月三十日遭受强烈地震灾害的阿尔巴尼亚迪勃拉和利布拉什德区的广大人民，在迅速消除地震所带来的灾害之后，继续发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，迎接今年春耕生产的新高潮，为争取今年的农牧业生产更大的发展而努力。
    新年一开始，迪勃拉区农业生产合作社的党支部、社委会、村人民会议就召开各种会议，讲形势，摆任务，社员们的生产热情高涨。目前，田头插遍了写着战斗口号的标语牌，到处呈现着一片热气腾腾的革命景象。社员们刚刚医治好地震灾害所造成的创伤，就立即重新审订了今年的生产计划，决心要比原计划超产十万公担的粮食。
    为了扩大灌溉面积，迪勃拉区的社员们正在寒风凛冽、大雪纷飞的季节里，努力开凿长十二公里的默赫里灌溉渠和长八公里的希纳灌溉渠。到今年一月底，社员们已经完成了工程的三分之一。整个工程预计能在五月份以前完成，那时全区又将有一千公顷的土地得到灌溉。
    一月份，利布拉什德区的气候变化无常，一会儿刮大风，一会儿下雪，一会儿又下雨。社员们排除万难，变冬闲为冬忙，积极上山开荒。全区今年和明年的开荒任务早已完成。位于深山地区的弗洛契农业生产合作社，去年年底就已传来喜讯：提前三年完成了第四个五年计划的开荒任务。现在全社百分之九十的社员天天上山开荒，扩大耕地面积，争取今年就向国家出售余粮。
    从去年十一月到今年一月，地处山区的迪勃拉区寒风怒吼，大雪连绵不断。合作社社员每天顶着风雪，在格洛波尔德、鲁尔、科拉比等山地、丘陵和山谷里铲雪开荒，修筑梯田。他们下决心要在今年年底就完成第四个五年计划的全部开荒任务。
    这两个区的社员们在争取今年粮食丰产的同时，还特别注意畜牧业生产。（附图片）
