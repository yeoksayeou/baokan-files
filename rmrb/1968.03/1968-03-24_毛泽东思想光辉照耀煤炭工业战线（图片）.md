The splendid light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the coal industry front. The broad revolutionary masses of workers at the Datong Coal Mine are fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with high spirits and fervent political enthusiasm, launching a wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production. This is a scene of miners studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with the PLA's leftist cadres, addressing issues from both revolutionary and production fronts.

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The PLA's leftist cadres at the Datong Coal Mine regard studying Mao Zedong Thought as a top priority, enthusiastically helping workers establish study systems like "Daily Reading," making Mao Zedong Thought widely popular in the mine. The leftist cadres and coal miners use their breaks to study Chairman Mao's works diligently.

The PLA's leftist cadres at the Datong Coal Mine resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions on holding study classes, assisting the families of workers in setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This ensures that every family member studies Chairman Mao's works and cares about national affairs, promoting the victory of the Cultural Revolution in the coal mine.

Treating the family as a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating the self and revisionism. Old worker He Changshou from the Datong Coal Mine, with deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, organizes the whole family to study Chairman Mao's works, criticizing the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" by the Chinese Khrushchev, promoting the thought revolution of the whole family.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat at the Tianzhuang Coal Mine of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, established a revolutionary committee, and seen a vibrant scene of revolution and production. The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau goes deep into the mines, using artistic forms to enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, inspiring coal miners to create new achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Coal Mine of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to fiercely combat the "self," encircle the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, achieving great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The cadres and workers of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to produce more and better coal for the country. This is a scene of cadres and workers laboring together at the Dongjing Coal Mining Area of the Taozhuang Mine.
