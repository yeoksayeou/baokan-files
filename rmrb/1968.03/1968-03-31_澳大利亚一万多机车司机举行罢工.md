Over ten thousand locomotive drivers and firemen in Australia went on strike on March 26 in various parts of the country, demanding wage increases and additional welfare allowances. This strike has dealt a heavy blow to Australia's industrial production, with several hundred factories and over one hundred thousand workers halting production. Striking workers held mass meetings in various states, calling for the continuation of the strike. They pointed out that the arbitration system is useless because it is a tool of the bourgeoisie. The working masses must take action.

    澳大利亚一万多机车司机举行罢工
    澳大利亚的一万五千名机车司机和司炉二十六日在澳大利亚各地举行罢工，要求提高工资和增加福利津贴。这次罢工给予澳大利亚工业生产沉重打击，有几百家工厂、十万多工人停止了生产。罢工工人在各州举行群众大会，要求继续罢工。他们指出，仲裁制度是没有用的，因为它是资产阶级的工具。工人群众必须行动起来。
