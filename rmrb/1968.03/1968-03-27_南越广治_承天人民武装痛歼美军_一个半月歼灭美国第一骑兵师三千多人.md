The people's liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri - Thua Thien region of South Vietnam inflicted heavy casualties on the U.S. forces from January 31 to March 15. They annihilated more than 3,000 American invaders and shot down or destroyed nearly 50 helicopters.

The two regiments of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division were sent from the Central Highlands to rescue the U.S. Marine Corps, which had been badly defeated. Once these American invaders entered the area around Hue and the eastern part of Highway 9, they were engulfed in the people's war and suffered heavy losses. From February 3 to 20, nearly 2,000 enemy troops were annihilated by the guerrilla forces and local troops in Chau Thuan and Hai Lang counties, and 35 helicopters were destroyed.

The people's liberation armed forces in the provinces of Thua Thien, Kien Tuong, and Tuyen Duc have achieved new victories since early March by taking the initiative to launch attacks.

On March 13, the people's liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province bravely ambushed a company of U.S. troops in Quang Dien County. After just 30 minutes of fierce battle, they annihilated an entire U.S. company. The next day, a U.S. company was "sweeping" around the enemy base in Tri Thien and suffered 60 deaths and many injuries at the hands of the people's liberation armed forces.

On March 21, the people's liberation armed forces attacked a U.S. company and enemy artillery positions west of Hue City. After 20 minutes of battle, they annihilated more than 100 U.S. troops and destroyed six cannons and mortars.

In the first half of March, the guerrilla forces in Phu Loc County ambushed and annihilated nearly 190 U.S. and puppet troops on Highway 1 from Da Nang to Hue, destroying or damaging 21 military vehicles.

From March 9 to 14, the military and civilians around the provincial capital of Kien Tuong City fought for five days, annihilating 395 enemy troops, shooting down four helicopters, damaging two, and seizing a batch of weapons.

From March 12 to 14, the people's liberation armed forces in Tuyen Duc Province, in battles to shell the Phu Yen U.S. base and counter "sweeping," killed or wounded more than 170 American invaders, destroyed 14 armored vehicles, shot down one aircraft, and seized a batch of weapons and military supplies.
