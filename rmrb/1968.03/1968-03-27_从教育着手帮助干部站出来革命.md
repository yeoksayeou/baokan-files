	Following the great strategic deployment of the great teacher Chairman Mao, the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee holds a three-in-one Mao Zedong Thought study class with remarkable results.

	Starting with education to help cadres stand out in the revolution.

	A large number of cadres have resolved the issues of correctly treating the masses and correctly treating themselves, examined their own mistakes, and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have successively returned to their respective regions and units to participate in work, and many have also joined the three-in-one revolutionary leadership organs.

	New China News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26 — The Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with the great teacher Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "handle cadre issues by starting with education and expanding the scope of education," has held a three-in-one Mao Zedong Thought study class. This class has helped a batch of cadres who have made mistakes to stand out in the revolution, achieving remarkable results.

	This session of the study class has recently concluded. A large number of cadres who have stood out, with deep feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have successively returned to their respective regions and units to participate in work. Many have also joined the revolutionary committees or three-in-one revolutionary leadership organs of their respective regions and units.

	This session of the study class was held by the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee based on the rapid development of the revolutionary situation across the province. Various regions and units are either establishing or preparing to establish three-in-one revolutionary leadership organs. This class was held to address the current situation where cadre work is relatively weak across the province. It is a session to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues and to solve cadre problems. Participants in this session include cadres, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, and soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army who are carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks, totaling more than a thousand people. Among them, there are more than 200 cadres at the bureau level or above, many of whom were formerly the top leaders of their respective regions and units. These leading cadres have made various degrees of mistakes in their past work and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Over the course of more than a month of study, representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "cadre issues should be handled by starting with education and expanding the scope of education," actively and enthusiastically used Mao Zedong Thought to educate the cadres. This promoted the cadres' self-awareness in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, enabling most of them to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They gained the understanding of the revolutionary masses of their respective regions and units and stood out to participate in the revolutionary ranks.

	The experience of this session of the study class shows that cadres who have made mistakes need to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The key is to correctly treat the masses and correctly treat themselves, no longer insist on mistakes, and be determined to follow Chairman Mao for life in revolution, working hard on the transformation of their worldview. The leading cadres who participated in this session of the study class were generally criticized by the revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Before participating in the study class, some of them had wrong thoughts such as resentment, discouragement, and unwillingness to admit mistakes. Some cadres thought their mistakes were not serious and were unwilling to make a thorough self-examination, even arguing with the revolutionary masses. Therefore, the study class emphasized from the beginning the importance of rectifying the style of study and vigorously promoting the revolutionary style of study advocated by Chairman Mao, which emphasizes the connection between theory and practice. In this stage, cadres generally identified "three fears": first, fear of losing face, as they used to educate others but now had to admit mistakes to the masses; second, fear of the revolutionary masses "raising the stakes" on their mistakes; third, fear of losing their positions. They summarized a lesson: past mistakes were due to not acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, and after making mistakes, they did not correct them with Mao Zedong Thought. The fundamental reason was not using the "Three Articles" to transform their worldview.

	On the basis of rectifying the style of study, cadres carried out the "three distinctions and one stand" activity, that is, distinguishing between the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, distinguishing between the capitalist reactionary line, distinguishing between bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They also generally conducted "remembrance, comparison, and examination." That is: remembering the bitterness of the old society, comparing the sweetness of the new society, and examining one's loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings; remembering the bitterness of being oppressed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the capitalist reactionary line, comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and examining one's attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; remembering the party's cultivation, comparing one's contributions to the revolution, and examining one's revolutionary spirit. They all examined their past mistakes of implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi in their work and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said painfully that no matter how many mistakes were made, the biggest mistake was not being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the biggest mistake was not following Mao Zedong Thought, and the biggest mistake was not implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. While examining their mistakes in large and small meetings, they also went to the representatives of the mass organizations that had the most opinions about them, sincerely listening to the criticisms and opinions of the masses, and having heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary masses. Cadres from the Guangzhou area also went to the homes of revolutionary masses who were suppressed and attacked by them in the early stages of the movement to examine their mistakes and apologize.

	Some cadres who participated in this session of the study class supported one faction and suppressed another, or favored one faction and neglected another during the movement. This was one of the reasons why one faction in the revolutionary mass organizations wanted to protect them while another faction wanted to overthrow them. Through study, these cadres realized that this not only reflected bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the cadre ranks but also showed that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line had not been thoroughly eliminated from the minds of the cadres. Without overcoming factionalism within the cadre ranks and thoroughly eliminating the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, it is impossible for cadres who have made mistakes to be completely liberated.

	The experience of this session of the study class also shows that to truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues in terms of thought and action, it is necessary to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism among the masses. Representatives of revolutionary mass organizations from various regions who participated in this session of the study class opened up a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism in the study class. They thoroughly exposed the manifestations of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in cadre issues and insisted on using proletarian party principles to deal with cadres. Many representatives of mass organizations said in their sharing sessions: in the past, we started from factionalism and used whether they supported our faction or not as the standard for whether a cadre was good or bad. With this wrong idea, it was impossible to seriously implement and execute Chairman Mao's great instructions on cadre issues of "starting with education and expanding the scope of education." Whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a major political issue that tests our loyalty to Chairman Mao and tests our stance and attitude in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Abandoning wrong views, cadres will stand before you." When representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations abandoned their factional views on cadre issues and analyzed cadres historically and comprehensively according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they sincerely felt that the vast majority of cadres in their respective regions and units were good or relatively good. To liberate cadres, one must first liberate one's own thoughts; to help cadres revolutionize, one must first revolutionize oneself.

	Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, representatives of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations who originally had differing views on cadre issues, together with the soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army who participated in the study class, formed "mutual aid groups" with the cadres and established "red groups." They widely carried out heart-to-heart talks, enthusiastically helping cadres recognize and correct their mistakes, and promoting cadres to quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

### 从教育着手帮助干部站出来革命

    紧跟伟大导师毛主席的伟大战略部署
    广东省革委会举办三结合的毛泽东思想学习班收效显著
    从教育着手帮助干部站出来革命
    大批干部解决了正确对待群众、正确对待自己的问题，检查了自己的错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。他们陆续返回本地区、本单位参加工作，许多人还参加了三结合领导机构
    新华社广州二十六日电　广东省革命委员会遵循伟大导师毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的最新指示，举办三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，帮助一批犯过错误的干部站出来革命，取得了显著效果。
    这个学习班最近已经结束。大批站出来的干部怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚感情，陆续回到本地区、本单位参加工作，许多人还参加了本地区、本单位革命委员会或三结合革命领导机构。
    这一期学习班，是广东省革命委员会根据全省革命形势迅猛发展，各地区、各单位纷纷成立或准备成立三结合的革命领导机构的迫切需要，针对全省当前运动中干部工作比较薄弱这个情况而举办的，是一期落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，解决干部问题的学习班。参加这期学习班的，有来自全省各地区、各单位的干部、革命群众组织代表、担负“三支”“两军”任务的解放军指战员共一千多人。其中有二百多名处级或专区级以上的领导干部，有不少人原来是各地区、各单位的第一把手。这些领导干部，在过去的工作中和无产阶级文化大革命运动中，都犯有不同程度的错误。在一个多月的学习中，各革命群众组织的代表，在毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”这一光辉思想的指引下，积极热情地用毛泽东思想教育干部，促进干部自觉地斗私批修，使他们当中的大多数人回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，获得了本地区、本单位两派革命群众的谅解，站出来参加了革命的行列。
    这期学习班的经验表明，犯了错误的干部要回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，关键是要正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，不再坚持错误，决心一辈子跟着毛主席干革命，在世界观的改造上狠下功夫。参加这期学习班的领导干部，在文化大革命运动中普遍受到过革命群众的批判。在参加学习班之前，他们中有的人存在着怨气、泄气、不服气等错误的思想情绪；有的干部认为自己的错误不大，不愿意作深刻的检查，甚至和革命群众“顶牛”。因此，学习班在一开始就特别强调要端正学风，大力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风。在这个阶段，干部普遍检查出“三怕”：一怕丑，过去都是教育别人，现在自己向群众认错，面子上不好看；二怕革命群众抓辫子，对自己的错误“无限上纲”；三怕丢官。他们总结出一条教训：过去犯错误是由于没有按照毛泽东思想办事，犯了错误以后又没有用毛泽东思想改正错误，最根本的原因是没有用“老三篇”改造自己的世界观。
    在端正学风的基础上，干部中开展了“三划一站”的活动，即划清和党内一小撮走资派的界限，划清和资产阶级反动路线的界限，划清和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的界限，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们还普遍进行了忆、比、查。就是：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，查自己忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情；忆受党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，查自己对无产阶级文化大革命的态度；忆党对自己的培养，比自己对革命的贡献，查自己的革命斗志。他们纷纷检查过去在工作中执行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的错误和在这次文化大革命中执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。他们沉痛地说，千错万错，不忠于伟大领袖毛主席是最大的错，不紧跟毛泽东思想是最大的错，不执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是最大的错。他们一边在大会、小会上检查自己的错误，一边就到对自己意见最大的群众组织的代表那里去，诚恳地听取群众的批评和意见，和革命群众谈心、交心。广州地区的干部，还到运动初期被自己压制、打击过的革命群众家里，向他们检查错误，赔礼道歉。
    参加这期学习班的有些干部，在运动中支一派，压一派，或者亲一派，疏一派。这是造成革命群众组织中一派要保他们，一派要打倒他们的原因之一。通过学习，这些干部认识到，这不仅是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在干部队伍中的反映，也是资产阶级反动路线的遗毒在干部头脑中没有肃清的表现。不克服干部队伍中的派性，不彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的遗毒，犯了错误的干部要完全获得解放也是不可能的。
    这一期学习班的经验还表明，要真正从思想上、行动上落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，必须扫除群众中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。参加这期学习班的各地区革命群众组织代表，在学习班上开辟了斗私批修的战场，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在干部问题上的表现，坚持用无产阶级党性原则对待干部。许多群众组织的代表在讲用会上说：过去我们从派性出发，用支持不支持我这一派当作是好干部还是坏干部的标准。有了这种错误思想，就不可能认真贯彻执行毛主席关于干部问题的“从教育着手，扩大教育面”的伟大指示。执行不执行毛主席的最新指示，这是考验我们忠不忠于毛主席，考验我们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中采取什么立场和态度的重大政治问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“丢掉错误的观点，干部就站在面前了。”当各革命群众组织的代表丢掉了在干部问题上的派性观点，按照毛主席的干部政策对干部作了历史的全面的分析时，就心悦诚服地感到，本地区、本单位的干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。要解放干部，首先自己思想要解放；要帮助干部革命，首先自己要革命。
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，原来在干部问题上看法有分歧的两派革命群众组织的代表，和参加学习班的解放军指战员一起，同干部组成“互助组”，结成“一组红”，广泛开展谈心活动，热情帮助干部认识错误、改正错误，促使干部迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
