The red sun rises, its rays shining brightly. We think of him day and night, longing for him endlessly. Our great teacher Chairman Mao has come! His old face is radiant, his complexion glowing red, and his health is extremely, extremely good. We cheer! We sing! Our excited hearts are about to leap out of our chests, and tears of happiness keep streaming down!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers endlessly love you! I remember the bright morning when I came to Beijing for a meeting. The entire company, with hearts full of boundless love for you, braved the biting cold wind to see me off, time and time again, urging me, "Comrade commander, when you see Chairman Mao in Beijing, be sure to ask after his health and wish him eternal life!" The comrades' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved me. I must present the red hearts of the communications warriors to the great leader Chairman Mao. Now that I have seen the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, how can I not shout with joy, sing aloud, and shout a thousand, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers will forever be loyal to you. In the life-and-death struggle against China's Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing, the entire company of revolutionary soldiers stood firmly on your revolutionary line. China's Khrushchev and his followers opposed our emphasis on politics, advocating "military first," "technology first," and we firmly resisted and criticized them. We firmly followed your great teaching that "without correct political views, one is like a soul-less body," and insisted on using your great thoughts to lead in all our work. When setting up a large-span aerial line rarely seen in the country, because we always emphasized politics and your brilliant thoughts, firmly opposed slave mentality, thoroughly buried foreign dogmas, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, dared to think, dared to do, broke through numerous technical difficulties, after multiple experiments, finally successfully completed the task, ensuring that your great voice reached the south of the Yangtze River and the front lines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your reception of us is the greatest care and encouragement! It is our greatest honor and happiness! We must study and apply your red book, further realize the revolutionization of our thoughts, and build our company into a red Mao Zedong Thought school that is forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your great thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line. We will raise your brilliant thoughts even higher, achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    一轮红日面前升，光芒万丈起彩虹。我们日日想，夜夜盼的伟大导师毛主席来了！他老人家神采奕奕，满面红光，身体非常非常健康。我们欢呼！我们歌唱！激动的心啊快要跳出胸膛，幸福的热泪一个劲地往外淌！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！革命战士无限热爱您！回想起我来北京开会的那个晴朗的早晨，全连同志怀着对您老人家无限热爱的心情，冒着凛冽的寒风，送了一程又一程，叮咛一遍又一遍：“连长啊，到北京见到毛主席，千万千万代我们问他老人家好，祝他老人家万寿无疆！”同志们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，深深地感动了我。我一定要把通信战士的颗颗红心，敬献给伟大领袖毛主席。现在见到了世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，我怎能不纵情欢呼，放声歌唱！怎能不千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！革命战士永远忠于您。在同中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿进行的殊死斗争中，我们连全体革命战士，坚决地站在您的革命路线一边。中国赫鲁晓夫及其走卒反对我们突出政治，鼓吹什么“军事第一”、“技术第一”，我们就坚决抵制，坚决批判。我们坚决按照您老人家“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的伟大教导，坚持在一切工作中用您的伟大思想挂帅。在架设全国罕见的大跨度飞线时，由于我们时时处处突出政治，突出您老人家的光辉思想，坚决打倒奴隶思想，彻底埋葬洋教条，相信群众，依靠群众，敢想，敢干，突破重重技术难关，经过多次试验，终于胜利地完成了任务，保证了您的伟大声音传到大江南北，传到反帝反修的最前线。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家接见我们，这是对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞！是我们最大的光荣，最大的幸福！我们一定要活学活用您的红色宝书，进一步实现思想革命化，把我们连队建设成为永远忠于您，永远忠于您的伟大思想，永远忠于您的革命路线的红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。我们要更高地举起您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
