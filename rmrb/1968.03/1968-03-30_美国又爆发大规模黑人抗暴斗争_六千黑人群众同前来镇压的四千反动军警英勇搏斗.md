Six thousand black protesters clash with four thousand reactionary military police

	New York, March 29 (Xinhua) -- In Memphis, Tennessee, more than six thousand black protesters took to the streets on March 28, engaging in a fierce struggle with over four thousand military police sent to suppress them.

	On the morning of March 28, black protesters marched in long lines through the heart of the black neighborhood, demonstrating in support of over a thousand sanitation workers who had been on strike for seven weeks. Their anger was directed at the reactionary authorities who had delayed addressing the workers' demands for increased wages.

	The Tennessee state government quickly mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen to work alongside local police, blocking streets and brutally suppressing the demonstrators with batons and tear gas. Undeterred by the violence, the black protesters fought back with sticks, stones, glass bottles, and whatever else they could find, injuring several police officers. Some young black men even gave a police officer a severe beating.

	The protesters also smashed pawn shops and stores that had been exploiting them with high-interest loans.

	The military police killed, injured, and arrested a number of protesters.

	As night fell, the black protesters continued their struggle. They set fires with Molotov cocktails throughout the city. According to the city's fire department, Memphis experienced 150 fires in one night, keeping the fire department busy. The black protesters also pelted fire trucks with stones.

	At the start of the struggle, the black preacher Martin Luther King, acting as a tool of the reactionary ruling class, attempted to seize the leadership of the protest and turn the demonstration into a "peaceful" march. However, he was rebuffed by the protesters. As the black protesters clashed with the military police, his loudspeaker car screamed, "The march is over," urging the protesters to "return to the church." But no one listened to him. Seeing the situation turn against him, he quickly fled down a small street, jumped into an old car, and drove away.

    美国又爆发大规模黑人抗暴斗争
    六千黑人群众同前来镇压的四千反动军警英勇搏斗
    新华社二十九日讯 华盛顿消息：田纳西州孟菲斯城六千多名黑人群众，二十八日掀起了一场大规模的武力抗暴斗争，同派去镇压他们的四千多名军警进行了英勇的搏斗。
    二十八日清晨，黑人群众排着长队在黑人区中心地带举行游行示威，支持已经罢工七星期的一千多名清洁工人，对反动当局迟迟不肯解决清洁工人的增加工资的要求表示愤怒。
    田纳西州当局慌忙出动四千名国民警卫队配合当地军警，封锁街道，用警棍和催泪瓦斯野蛮镇压示威者。黑人群众不畏强暴，用棍棒、石块、玻璃瓶以及他们所能找到的任何东西进行英勇的还击，打伤数名警察。一些黑人青年还把一名警官狠狠地揍了一顿。
    示威者还砸了平时对他们进行高利剥削的当铺和商店。
    军警打死、打伤和逮捕了一批示威者。
    入夜，黑人群众仍然坚持斗争。他们用汽油瓶到处点火。据市消防队统计，孟菲斯城一夜发生了一百五十起火警，闹得消防队疲于奔命。黑人群众还用石块追打救火车。
    在斗争开始时，充当反动统治集团工具的黑人牧师马丁·路得·金曾经企图篡夺斗争领导权，把这次示威行动变成一次“和平”游行。但是遭到示威群众的抵制。在黑人同军警搏斗的时候，他的宣传车就声嘶力竭地叫喊“游行已经结束”，要示威者“回到教堂去”。但是，没有人听他的话，他见势不妙，吓得赶快跑进一条小街，跳上一辆旧汽车溜走了。
