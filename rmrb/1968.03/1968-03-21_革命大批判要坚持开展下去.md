Today, this newspaper reported on the situation and experience of the Second Brigade Westward and the Mu Cheng Jian Coal Mine in carrying out mass revolutionary criticism. Please, comrades, read it carefully.

Mobilizing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a weapon, to carry out a deep revolutionary criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in various places, this is the general direction of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must firmly grasp this general direction from beginning to end. Any tendency to relax revolutionary criticism must be prevented and corrected.

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev at the helm, have long been exposed by the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of revolutionaries. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have pushed in various fields and on various fronts has not been thoroughly criticized; their heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism have not been thoroughly settled; the poison they have spread among the masses has not been thoroughly eliminated. They are not willing to accept their defeat. They are still using every means at their disposal to exploit their social influence, adopting various conspiratorial methods, and continuously launching frenzied counterattacks against the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Absolutely do not relax one's fighting will, any thought of relaxing one's fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong."

The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is like two armies facing off, with no room for compromise. If you do not attack them, they will attack you; if you do not defeat them, they will defeat you; if you do not thoroughly defeat them, they will rise up again. The proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of revolutionaries must unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in carrying out revolutionary criticism for a long time, and actively, without interruption, launch attacks and counterattacks against the enemy until final victory is achieved.

In the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is nearing comprehensive victory, the class struggle has become even more acute and complex. We must strengthen our class struggle consciousness, strengthen line struggle education, carry forward the fighting spirit of "beating fallen dogs" advocated by Lu Xun, combine it with various work tasks, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, to thoroughly criticize and expose this handful of capitalist roaders politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

The seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are all critics. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, wage a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism, with everyone speaking out and writing, we will definitely be able to thoroughly bury the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary line they push, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over every battlefield.

    革命大批判要坚持开展下去
    本报评论员
    今天，本报报道了西向第二大队和木城涧煤矿开展群众性革命大批判的情况和经验。请同志们好好读一读。
    发动广大工农兵群众，以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为武器，对党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人，展开深入的革命大批判，这是无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向。我们必须自始至终地、牢牢地掌握这个大方向。任何放松革命大批判的偏向，都必须防止和纠正。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，早已被无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众揭露出来了。但是，他们在各条战线、各个领域里所推行的反革命修正主义路线，还没有彻底批判；他们妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，还没有彻底清算；他们在群众中所散布的流毒，还没有彻底肃清。他们决不甘心自己的失败。他们还在千方百计地利用自己所能达到的社会影响，采取各种各样的阴谋手段，不断地向无产阶级进行疯狂的反扑。
    毛主席教导我们：“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”
    无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，犹如两军对垒，决无调和的余地。你不攻他，他就攻你；你不吃掉他，他就吃掉你；你不把他彻底打倒，他就要爬起来反扑。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来，把革命大批判持久地坚持下去，主动地、不停顿地向敌人展开进攻、再进攻，直到取得最后胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的情况下，阶级斗争更加尖锐复杂。我们必须加强阶级斗争观念，加强路线斗争教育，发扬鲁迅所提倡的“痛打落水狗”的战斗精神，结合各项工作任务，结合本单位的斗、批、改，狠狠地把这一小撮走资派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，斗倒斗臭。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民，个个都是批判家。只要我们充分发动群众，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”，人人口诛笔伐，就一定能够把党内一小撮走资派和他们推行的资产阶级反动路线彻底埋葬，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍一切阵地。
