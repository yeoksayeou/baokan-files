The military and people of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam have been displaying the power of people's war, fighting bravely and growing stronger. They have continuously besieged the American troops in the Khe Sanh area for nearly fifty days and nights. The fierce artillery fire has shaken the earth and mountains, causing the enemy base to tremble. The tightening encirclement has frightened the enemy, making them huddle in their strongholds in a miserable state.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, March 13 — According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation army in the northern part of Quang Tri Province has been fighting bravely and growing stronger. They have continuously attacked the enemy troops besieged in the Khe Sanh area for nearly fifty days and nights. On March 8, the liberation army used fierce artillery fire to bombard the Da Krong stronghold and the forward positions on the 575 and 845 hills northwest of Da Krong. The shells accurately hit the targets, shaking the earth and mountains and turning the area into a sea of fire.

	According to preliminary reports, from 9:30 AM to 8:00 PM on March 8, the liberation army bombarded the enemy twelve times. The shells hit the artillery positions, airfield, barracks, and warehouses in the Da Krong stronghold, killing and wounding more than 130 American invaders and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. That day, not a single enemy plane could land at the Da Krong stronghold and the 575 and 845 hills.

	The report said that since January 20, when the military and people of northern Quang Tri Province began besieging the American invaders in the Khe Sanh area, they have been tightening the encirclement around the Da Krong stronghold and the 575, 845, and 832 hills, achieving great victories.

	The report said that during the nearly fifty days and nights of besieging the American invaders in the Khe Sanh area, the military and people of Quang Tri Province have continuously attacked the enemy nearly one hundred times, killing and capturing nearly 1,960 enemy troops, most of whom are American invaders. They have destroyed and damaged 196 aircraft of various types, destroyed many barracks and warehouses, including many fuel depots, ammunition depots, and other war tool warehouses.

	The military and people of Quang Tri Province have fully displayed the power of people's war, closely coordinating from east to west on the entire Route 9 battlefield, continuously attacking and besieging the enemy, putting the American invaders in the Khe Sanh area in a very miserable situation.

	The artillery units of the liberation army have been continuously tightening the encirclement around various targets in the Khe Sanh area, approaching the enemy's nests. Despite the enemy's bombing, they bravely and tenaciously bombard the American aggressors in Khe Sanh day and night, and form a fire net in the sky over Khe Sanh to actively disrupt the enemy's air supply. Sometimes, the liberation army soldiers shoot down ten aircraft of various types in one day, and sometimes they blow up American planes on the enemy's airfield, annihilating dozens of American soldiers in one go.

	The guerrilla forces and local troops closely cooperate with the liberation army, continuously strengthening various military activities, assisting the liberation army in tightening the encirclement around various enemy targets along Route 9, proactively attacking the enemy's reinforcements and transfers, disrupting the enemy's transportation lines, making all roads to Khe Sanh completely paralyzed, cutting off water transportation to the east of Route 9, sinking and damaging many warships, boats, and barges, killing hundreds of enemy troops, destroying a large number of combat tools, and putting the American troops in Khe Sanh in a precarious situation.

	The report said that on March 1, the liberation army in this province fought a fierce battle with a battalion of puppet troops, which had armored vehicles and air cover, in Chau Loc commune, seven kilometers east of Dong Ha. They annihilated more than 200 enemy troops, destroyed three enemy armored vehicles, shot down two planes, and damaged several others.

	In addition, from February 28 to March 5, the military and people of the Thua Thien-Hue region continued to launch extensive attacks, killing nearly 1,000 enemy troops, most of whom were American soldiers. They sank seven warships, shot down seven planes, and destroyed or damaged seven military vehicles.

　　猛烈炮火炸得美军基地地动山摇　紧缩包围圈吓得敌人龟缩据点狼狈万状
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治省北部解放军越战越勇，越战越强，连续袭击被围困在溪山地区近五十个昼夜的敌军。八日，解放军用猛烈的炮火，轰击溪山地区的达根据点和达根西北面五七五、八四五两高地的前哨据点，炮弹准确地击中各个目标，炸得地动山摇，使那里变成一片火海。
    据初步消息，解放军从八日上午九时三十分到晚上八时，共炮轰十二次，炮弹命中了达根据点的炮兵阵地、机场、兵营和仓库，打死打伤美国侵略军一百三十多名，使敌人遭受重大损失。当天，没有任何一架敌机可以在达根据点和五七五、八四五两个高地降落。
    报道说，广治省北部军民从一月二十日开始包围溪山地区的美国侵略军以来，日益缩紧对达根据点和五七五、八四五、八三二等高地的包围，取得了巨大战功。
    报道说，广治省军民在围困溪山地区的美国侵略军近五十个昼夜里，连续袭击敌人近一百次，消灭和俘虏敌人近一千九百六十名，大部分是美国侵略军，击毁和击伤各种类型飞机一百九十六架，击毁许多营房和仓库，其中包括许多汽油库、弹药库和其他战争工具仓库。
    广治省北部军民全面地发挥了人民战争的威力，在整个第九号公路战场上，从东到西紧密配合，连续进攻，连续围困敌人，使溪山地区的美国侵略军陷于极其狼狈的困境。
    解放军炮兵部队不断地紧缩对溪山地区各个目标的包围圈，逼近敌人巢穴。他们不顾敌人轰炸，英勇顽强地日夜轰击溪山的美国强盗，并在溪山上空组成火网，积极破坏敌人的空中补给。有时，解放军战士一天就击落各种类型飞机十架，有时就在敌军机场上把美机炸得粉碎，一举歼灭美军四、五十名。
    游击队和地方部队同解放军密切配合，不断地加强各种军事活动，协助解放军紧缩对第九号公路沿线的各个敌军目标的包围圈，主动袭击增援和转移的敌人，破坏敌人的交通线，使通往溪山的各条公路完全瘫痪，切断了第九号公路东面的水路交通，击沉击伤多艘战船、战艇和驳船，消灭敌人成百名，击毁大批作战工具，使溪山的美军陷于岌岌可危的境地。
    报道说，这个省的解放军，三月一日在东河东面七公里的兆福乡儒里村，同有装甲车和飞机掩护的一营伪军进行了一场激烈的战斗，歼敌二百多名，击伤敌人装甲车三辆，击落飞机两架、击伤多架。
    此外，承天—顺化地区军民，在二月二十八日到三月五日期间，继续广泛出击，共消灭敌人近一千名，其中大部分是美军，击沉战船七艘，击落飞机七架，击毁击伤军车七辆。
