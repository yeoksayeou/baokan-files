The wind grew stronger, and in an instant, sand flew and the sky darkened, making it impossible to keep one's eyes open.

Facing the gale, several soldiers carried torches, striving to reach the top of a mountain. Leading the way was Xū Ānchéng, a Communist Party member and veteran soldier from the Engineering Corps. He and his comrades were determined to complete the final weld, the most challenging one, as planned that day. "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They sang as they marched forward, their voices drowning out the howling wind.

The final welding operation began amidst a nine-level gale. Xū Ānchéng used up an entire box of matches, but the torch still wouldn't light. Undeterred by the biting cold, they took off their heavy coats, formed a circle, and created a makeshift tent to shield the wind. Only then did they manage to light the torch. However, the extreme cold made it impossible to maintain the torch's temperature. By the time one side of the weld was heated, the other side had already cooled down. After working all morning, the task remained unfinished.

It was time for lunch, but Xū Ānchéng and his comrades didn't have time to eat. They opened the Little Red Book: "What is work? Work is struggle." "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to bear it." The radiance of the red sun warmed the soldiers' hearts, and Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength. In the howling wind, their blood boiled, and they were full of energy.

Xū Ānchéng, a veteran who had extended his service, and his comrades had endured countless hardships and toils on the grueling construction site, shedding sweat and blood. In the summer, they worked in underground tunnels two meters deep, where the temperature reached sixty degrees. The tunnels were so narrow that they couldn't stand upright or straighten their backs. Their skin peeled from the sun, and their hands blistered from the heat, but they paid no mind. Their sole focus was to contribute to the socialist construction of their motherland and to be loyal to Chairman Mao.

Now, facing the wind and cold, this was another test of their revolutionary will and spirit. Soldiers of the Engineering Corps, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were undaunted by any hardship. They firmly declared, "The stronger the wind, the greater our resolve to complete the mission! The colder the weather, the hotter our loyalty to Chairman Mao!" They brainstormed and found solutions. One torch wasn't enough, so they used two. Two weren't enough, so they added four... They were determined to use the boundless loyalty of revolutionary soldiers to Chairman Mao to heat and melt the weld. One by one, the torches were lit, and the final assault began. Two welding teams from down the mountain completed their tasks and rushed to support them. After a nine-hour intense battle, they finally conquered this "fortress" and completed the final weld. Xū Ānchéng and his comrades, forgetting their fatigue, hunger, and cold, loudly recited the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and returned victorious.

　　红太阳温暖战士心
    风，越刮越大，刹时间，飞沙走石，天昏地暗，刮得人连眼也睁不开。
    顶着狂风，几个战士手提喷灯，吃劲地朝一个山顶走去。走在最前头的是工程兵某部共产党员、老战士胥安成同志。他和战友们决心在这天按计划封焊完最后一个接头，也是最困难的一个接头。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们一路前进一路歌。宏亮的歌声压倒了呼啸的寒风。
    最后一场封焊作业的紧张战斗迎着九级大风开始了。胥安成把一盒火柴划光了，喷灯还没有点燃。他们不顾刺骨寒风的袭击，把身上的皮大衣脱下来，围成圆圈，搭成一个临时挡风的
  “帐篷”，好不容易才把喷灯点燃了。但是天寒风大，气温太低，喷灯的温度怎么也烧不上去，接头的这边还没烧热，那边又凉了。烧了一上午，任务还没完成。
    该吃中午饭了。胥安成他们那里顾得上！他们习惯地打开红色宝书：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”红太阳的光辉温暖着战士们的心，毛主席的教导给了他们无穷的力量。在呼啸的寒风里，同志们一个个热血沸腾，浑身是劲。
    胥安成这个超期服役的老战士，和战友们一起，在艰苦的施工战场，吃了多少苦和累，流了多少汗和血。夏天，在地下两米深的作业孔内焊接，气温高达六十度；“入孔”小，抬不起头，伸不直腰，背晒脱了皮，手烫起了泡，他们全不在意，一心一意要为祖国社会主义建设多献一分力量，为保卫毛主席尽一分忠心。
    现在，大风和严寒摆在他们的面前，这是对他们的革命意志、革命精神的又一次考验。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工程兵战士，任何艰苦困难都不在话下。他们坚定地说：“风大，我们坚决完成任务的决心更大！天冷，我们忠于毛主席的红心火热！”大家出主意，想办法，一个喷灯火力不够，用两个，两个不够，加四个……他们决心用革命战士无限忠于毛主席的颗颗红心，把焊接头烧红，溶化。一个个喷灯点燃了，最后的总攻开始了。山下两个焊接组完成了任务，也先后赶来支援。经过一场整整九个钟头的紧张战斗，终于攻克了这个“堡垒”，焊接好了最后一个接头。胥安成和战友们忘掉了疲劳、饥饿和寒冷，高声背诵着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，胜利归来。
