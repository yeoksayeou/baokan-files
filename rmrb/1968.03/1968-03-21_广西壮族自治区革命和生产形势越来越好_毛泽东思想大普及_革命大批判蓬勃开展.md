Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is excellent and getting better and better.

From the Yuyong Pass to the northern mountains, from the coast of the Beibu Gulf to the banks of the Hongshui River, the 24 million people of various ethnic groups in the autonomous region are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, encircling the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and rapidly launching a campaign to achieve great unity in revolution and promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The entire autonomous region has already achieved great unity in revolution in six prefectures, three cities, and more than 40 counties. Many prefectures, counties, factories, mines, organs, and schools have recently established revolutionary three-in-one combination provisional power organs.

A ship in the vast ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. The excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi is the victory achieved by the people of various ethnic groups in the entire region who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of Guangxi, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, under the help of the broad cadres and soldiers of the Guangxi Military Region and the stationed troops of the People's Liberation Army, have placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything else. They have learned and applied them in the struggle, greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. After the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were issued, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat responded immediately and implemented them. They have established more than 50,000 classes of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the region, with more than 5 million revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers participating in the study. They have been loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a single-minded devotion and have grasped the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, launching a "people's war" to encircle bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and greatly strengthening proletarian party spirit. At the struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism meetings held by the two factions in many grassroots units, both sides followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "each making self-criticism," sincerely learning from each other's strengths and honestly examining their own shortcomings and mistakes. The leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations in Guangxi also examined their factionalism at a meeting attended by both factions. The heartfelt common revolutionary call was: Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are our guidelines for action. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, rapidly achieving great unity in revolution and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought in unity, with the greatest determination, promoting the surging tide of great unity in revolution, and the revolutionary three-in-one combination provisional power organs are also being born one after another.

The revolutionary great criticism is being vigorously carried out throughout the region. The people of various ethnic groups, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following the great teacher Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," have set up revolutionary great criticism battlefields everywhere in workshops, fields, classrooms, and organs, deeply exposing and criticizing the entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guangxi, greatly raising the awareness of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. They said, we proletarian revolutionaries are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; we hate the old society infinitely, hate imperialism, revisionism, and counter-revolution infinitely, and hate the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guangxi infinitely; we will firmly walk the road of socialism and communism. The broad revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, expressed their determination to carry out the revolutionary great criticism more extensively and deeply, further consolidate and develop the great unity in revolution and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn Guangxi into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought has promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, turning spirit into matter, making the industrial and agricultural production of the entire autonomous region prosperous. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production" with great enthusiasm. They are revolutionaries in revolution and pioneers in production. The agricultural production of the entire region last year achieved an unprecedented great harvest, with significant increases in grain, peanuts, sugarcane, hemp, pigs, fruits, and vegetables. Industrial production and transportation have also achieved results. Currently, it is the busy spring plowing season, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have launched another magnificent spring plowing and production campaign to seize an even greater harvest this year.

The excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Guangxi is inseparable from the strong support of the Guangxi Military Region and the stationed troops of the People's Liberation Army.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi have responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses" with great enthusiasm, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, undertaking the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries," and making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Guangxi. In the new situation of the current cultural revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers are further implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions, resolutely implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting the factions, wholeheartedly helping the broad revolutionary masses to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and doing a better job of the "three supports and two militaries" work.

    广西壮族自治区革命和生产形势越来越好
    毛泽东思想大普及　革命大批判蓬勃开展
    新华社南宁二十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，广西壮族自治区的无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势一派大好，越来越好。
    从友谊关下到桂北山区，从北部湾边到红水河畔，自治区的二千四百万各族革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，迅速掀起了实现革命大联合、促进革命三结合的热潮。全自治区已有六个专区、三个市、四十多个县实现了革命大联合，许多专区、县和工厂、矿山、机关、学校，最近纷纷成立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。广西无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，是全区各族革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，落实毛主席最新指示所取得的胜利成果。在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命中，广西广大革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，在人民解放军广西军区和驻军广大指战员的帮助下，把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切的地位，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，极大地促进了人的思想革命化。伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示传来后，广大无产阶级革命派闻风而动，立即贯彻执行。他们在全区办起了五万多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的五百多万革命群众、革命干部和解放军指战员，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，用毛泽东思想破私立公，开展了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，大力增强无产阶级党性。在许多基层单位的两派群众组织举行的斗私批修会上，双方遵循毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导，诚恳地学习对方的优点和长处，坦率地检查自己的缺点和错误。广西两派革命群众组织总部的负责人，还在两派群众参加的大会上检查了自己的派性。人们发自肺腑的共同革命呼声是：毛主席的一系列最新指示是我们行动的准则，我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的最新指示办事，迅速实现革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。他们学用一致，以最大的决心，促使革命大联合的洪流滚滚向前，革命三结合的临时权力机构也一个接一个地诞生。
    革命的大批判，正在全区各地蓬勃展开。各族革命人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循伟大导师毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在车间，在田头，在课堂，在机关，到处摆开革命大批判的战场，深刻揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在广西的代理人所推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们说，我们无产阶级革命派无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；我们无比痛恨旧社会，无比痛恨帝、修、反，无比痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫及其在广西的代理人；我们要坚定地走社会主义、共产主义道路。各族广大革命群众满怀革命豪情地表示，一定要更加广泛深入地开展革命的大批判，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把广西办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    毛泽东思想的空前大普及，促进了人的思想革命化，精神变物质，使全自治区的工农业生产欣欣向荣。广大贫下中农坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，革命当闯将，生产打先锋。全区去年农业生产获得了空前未有的大丰收，粮食、花生、甘蔗、麻类、生猪、水果、蔬菜等，都有较大幅度的增产。工业生产和交通运输也取得了成绩。目前正值春耕大忙时节，广大贫下中农和革命干部为夺取今年农业生产的更大丰收，又掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产热潮。
    广西无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产大好形势的出现，是和人民解放军广西军区和广西驻军的大力支援分不开的。
    驻广西的人民解放军广大指战员，坚决响应毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，担负起“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，为广西的无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产作出了巨大贡献。在当前文化大革命的新形势下，广大指战员正进一步贯彻毛主席的伟大指示，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，满腔热情地帮助广大革命群众全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好。
