Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe love you immensely.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe love the reddest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, immensely.

One day, in a certain place in the Soviet Union, two collective farm members saw a Chinese comrade reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They were very excited and took the precious book, enthusiastically praising the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

They gazed at the portrait of Chairman Mao in "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with boundless admiration and wrote enthusiastically in this precious book: "Mao Zedong, the Soviet people support your thoughts! Wish you eternal life!"

A friend from Georgia in the Soviet Union warmly invited Chinese comrades visiting there to his home. He opened a bottle of fragrant wine and poured full glasses for the Chinese comrades. He said excitedly, "For the health and longevity of Comrade Mao Zedong, let us raise the wine from Stalin's hometown and drink together!" The Chinese comrades and the Georgian friend raised their glasses together, toasting to the eternal life of the great leader Chairman Mao!

A young female worker in Czechoslovakia once pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao inside her wardrobe at her workplace. Later, her supervisor found out and reported it to the police. This young woman was summoned and dismissed from her unit. However, this brave and steadfast young woman, rather than suffer persecution, remained unshakable in her belief of loving Chairman Mao. After that, she studied Chairman Mao's works even more actively and loved the great Mao Zedong Thought even more.

Under the rule of the Tito clique in Yugoslavia, one day, a little girl walked up to a Chinese comrade and said, "I want two Chairman Mao badges, one for myself and one for my classmate." The Chinese comrade fulfilled her wish. She was overjoyed and repeatedly said, "We love Chairman Mao!"

A Yugoslav revolutionary wrote in a poem praising the great leader Chairman Mao:

Under the dark rule,
We will not lose our faith,
We will not lose our way,
Because the guiding beacon leading us forward,
Is the great Mao Zedong Thought.
Mao Zedong Thought is a great and brilliant red star,
Mao Zedong belongs to the revolutionary people of the whole world!

　　毛主席，苏联和东欧国家革命人民无限热爱您
    据新华社讯　苏联和东欧国家革命人民无限热爱世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    一天，在苏联某地，两位苏联集体农庄庄员看到中国同志正在阅读《毛主席语录》，他们十分激动地拿起宝书，热烈赞扬光辉的毛泽东思想。
    他们以无限敬仰的心情凝视着《毛主席语录》里的毛主席像，并且热情洋溢地在这本宝书上写道：“毛泽东，苏联人民拥护您的思想！祝您万寿无疆！”
    苏联格鲁吉亚一位朋友，满怀盛情地邀请在那里访问的中国同志们到他家作客。他打开了一瓶浓郁醇香的酒，满满地斟了几杯，送到中国同志面前。他激动地说：“为了毛泽东同志健康长寿，让我们举起斯大林故乡的酒，共同干杯！”中国同志和格鲁吉亚朋友一起举起了酒杯，共祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    捷克斯洛伐克一位青年女工，曾把一张毛主席像贴在她工作地点的衣柜里面。后来，她的上司发现了这件事，便报告了警察当局。这个青年女工因此被传讯，并且被本单位开除了。但是，这位英勇顽强的青年，宁可遭受迫害，也决不动摇自己热爱毛主席的坚强信念。此后，她更加积极地学习毛主席著作，更加热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。
    在铁托集团统治下的南斯拉夫，有一天，一个小姑娘走到中国同志面前说：“我想要两枚毛主席像章，一枚给我自己，另一枚带给我的同学。”中国同志满足了她的愿望。她高兴极了，连连说：“我们热爱毛主席！”
    一位南斯拉夫革命者在一首热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的诗中写道：
    在黑暗的统治下，
    我们不会丧失信心，
　　我们不会迷失方向，
　　因为引导我们前进的指路明灯，
　　是伟大的毛泽东思想。
　　毛泽东思想是巨大而光辉灿烂的红星，
　　毛泽东属于全世界革命人民！
