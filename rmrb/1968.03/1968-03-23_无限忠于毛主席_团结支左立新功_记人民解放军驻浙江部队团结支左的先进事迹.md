The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the fundamental guarantees for the success of our cause." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, comprising the army, navy, and air force, has defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Based on Mao Zedong Thought, they have carried forward the glorious tradition of unity within the army, standing shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. They have adhered to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and have established new merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province.

Thousands in unity, all in unity,
Unity in being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, based on the great Mao Zedong Thought, the three armed forces stationed in Zhejiang have formed a fighting entity. They share the same stance, the same hatreds and loves, the same views, and the same language. Thousands in unity, all in unity, unity in being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly aroused the class consciousness of the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers. They have studied and applied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the midst of class struggle. They have deeply understood the necessity of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as a series of major issues such as whose revolution it is and how to revolutionize. This has raised the ideological revolutionization of the troops to a new level. The mark of this level is being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

With the "loyalty" to the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, one can have the correct attitude and common stance towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. One can have a unified view and common class feelings towards the proletarian revolutionary masses. One can clearly and resolutely support and protect the leftists, and unite and educate the broad masses. The "Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters" was formed in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line. The 6409th and 7350th units stationed in Zhejiang had red hearts and bright eyes, and unanimously supported this revolutionary mass organization. In times of great difficulty, the two units stood up together and loudly declared to the people of the entire province: We swear to share weal and woe with the proletarian revolutionary masses!

With the "loyalty" to the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, the more intense the struggle and the more treacherous the environment, the more united one can be, fighting together to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In Xiaoshan County, two companies simultaneously supported the local proletarian revolutionary masses. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were terrified and tried every means to sow discord between the two companies. The soldiers of the two companies saw through the enemy's plot and united even more closely. They communicated with each other, unified their views, helped and supported each other, and stood together like a single rope, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses and thoroughly smashing the enemy's plot, achieving one great victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Xiaoshan area.

With the "loyalty" to the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, different military branches and different units can be united in thought, organization, and action. They support the left in one factory, conduct military training in one school, propagate Mao Zedong Thought on one stage, study the latest instructions together, summarize experiences together, and organize study sessions on Mao Zedong Thought activists to give mobile reports. They regard each other's party committees as their own, and each other's leaders as their own. The party committees of the two units often hold meetings together, jointly study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and jointly research and solve major problems in the work of supporting the left.

In summary, with the "loyalty" to our great leader Chairman Mao, unity has a foundation, and the work of supporting the left is guaranteed. The three armed forces stationed in Zhejiang have formed a fighting entity on this foundation, ensuring that wherever they support the left, they achieve victory!

Whoever holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought,
Learn from them

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study."

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the units stationed in Zhejiang extensively and enthusiastically carried out mass activities to learn from each other and strengthen unity. They said that this is necessary to achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province, to strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the troops, and to defend the national maritime frontier and smash the attacks of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

Whoever holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, whoever defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line most bravely, and whoever implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions most resolutely, learn from them. This is the common wish and action slogan of the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers stationed in Zhejiang.

A certain unit of the 6409th unit stationed in Hangzhou, when they first supported the left, encountered new situations and problems. They proactively sought guidance from the 7350th unit. During intense struggles, they almost every night went to report the situation and listen to opinions. They even moved the office for supporting the left together. The 7350th unit also regarded the process of joint struggle with the other unit as an opportunity to learn from the brother unit. The two units learned from each other and promoted each other, driving the work of supporting the left forward. In early September last year, the party committees of the two units both decided to learn from each other. They compiled the supporting left experiences and love-for-the-people deeds of the brother unit into a book and distributed it to the troops as a living textbook. The military training team of Hangzhou No. 11 Middle School was composed of cadres and soldiers from the two units. These two units not only actively learned but also enthusiastically helped each other, leaving difficulties for themselves and convenience for others. The cadres and soldiers of the two units also remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "being modest, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient," and extensively carried out activities to learn from other brother units stationed in Zhejiang. They invited comrades from the 429th unit, who firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Zhoushan area, to give reports. They extensively publicized the heroic deeds of the comrades from the three military academies who defended the proletarian revolutionary masses in Jinhua with their blood and lives. They humbly learned from the fearless fighting spirit of the supporting left detachment of a certain naval unit. All of these became the driving force for the two units to keep moving forward.

The units stationed in Zhejiang are like this. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the more they study, the more united they become; the more they study, the more they love Chairman Mao and the more loyal they are to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Under the unified command of the great commander Chairman Mao, their thoughts and steps are consistent, and they do the work of "three supports" and "two militaries" better and better.

Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions comprehensively,
Firmly supporting the left without supporting factions

The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers stationed in Zhejiang deeply understand that, based on Mao Zedong Thought, unity and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, is the key to doing a good job in the work of "three supports" and "two militaries."

Starting from this point, they never forget to arm their minds with Chairman Mao's latest instructions at any time, and resolutely resist the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in society. A military training team jointly composed of cadres and soldiers from the 7350th and 6409th units, when they first arrived at Hangzhou No. 12 Middle School to conduct military training, encountered a situation where the two factions in the school were fighting an "internal war." The comrades in the military training team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses," conducted investigations and research among the masses together, had heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary mass organizations together, and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work among the two factions of masses, making this school quickly achieve revolutionary great unity under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, the key lies in the leadership. Last winter, when the proletarian revolutionary masses in Jinhua and Qu County followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to implement revolutionary great unity, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in order to save their doomed fate, created incidents and attempted to sow discord between the units stationed in Qu County and Jinhua, and disrupt the unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the two counties. Facing this situation, the leading comrades of the units stationed in Jinhua and Qu County believed that to prevent the troops from falling into the enemy's trap and getting involved in the two-faction struggle, they must set an example themselves. They went to the stationed area of the brother unit, humbly learned from the advanced experience of the brother unit in supporting the left without supporting factions, and vigorously publicized Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to the revolutionary masses. Under the leadership's influence, the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers of the two units had more consistent thoughts, resolutely implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, guided the proletarian revolutionary masses of the two counties to enhance proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and jointly fought for the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the two places. The enemy's evil plot was smashed, and the military-civilian unity became even tighter. Soon, revolutionary committees were established in the two counties on the same day.

A fighting collective, a red Great Wall

The heroic three armed forces stationed in Zhejiang, based on the great Mao Zedong Thought, united as one, supported the left without supporting factions, brought about the great unity of the revolutionary masses, and brought about the great unity of the military and the people. This made our troops and the 31 million heroic sons and daughters guarding the front line of the East China Sea, the glorious tradition of military-civilian unity established in the war years, have a new development. A blood-and-flesh relationship and a fish-water relationship between the military and the people were formed.

Last October, the preparatory committee of the provincial workers' congress was impacted by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. At this critical moment, the 7350th and 6409th units jointly helped the responsible comrades of various major systems' revolutionary organizations to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The leading comrades of the two units studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great unity together with them, jointly criticized and repudiated revisionism, and patiently and sincerely educated and helped them with their factionalism. The comrades participating in the study class, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the exemplary actions of the two units in uniting to support the left, decided to learn from these two heroic units, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, turned back-to-back into hand-in-hand, and turned competing for seats into yielding seats. The revolutionary ranks of the working class throughout the province formed an iron fist and successfully held the provincial workers' congress, achieving revolutionary great unity.

Nowadays, no matter where you go, you can see everywhere the heroic deeds of military-civilian unity, "fighting for the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive, and sacrificing for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead." You can see everywhere the moving scenes of the military and the people studying the treasure book under one lamp, discussing thoughts on one bench, conducting big criticism on one platform, and fighting selfishness on one occasion. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, covering the entire province. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. The spiritual face of the revolutionary masses has never been as full of vigor and fighting spirit as it is today. The entire province's military and people are displaying sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm and have achieved great victories in both revolution and production.

    无限忠于毛主席　团结支左立新功
    ——记人民解放军驻浙江部队团结支左的先进事迹
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军驻浙江的陆海空三军为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在毛泽东思想的基础上，发扬我军团结一致的光荣传统，肩并肩，心连心，坚持支左不支派的原则，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，为浙江省的无产阶级文化大革命建立了新的功勋。
    千同万同，同在无限
    忠于毛主席的“忠”字上
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在伟大的毛泽东思想的基础上，驻浙江三军结成了一个战斗整体。他们有着共同的立场，共同的爱憎，共同的观点，共同的语言。千同万同，就同在无限忠于毛主席的“忠”字上。
    无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，极大地激发了广大指战员的阶级觉悟。他们在阶级斗争大风大浪中活学活用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，深刻地懂得了在无产阶级专政下必须继续革命，以及革谁的命，怎样革命等一系列重大问题，使部队的思想革命化，提高到了一个新的高度。这个高度的标志，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    有了对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席的“忠”字，就能对无产阶级文化大革命有正确的态度、共同的立场。就能对无产阶级革命派有一致的看法、共同的阶级感情。就能旗帜鲜明地坚决支持左派，保护左派，团结教育广大群众。“浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部”是在和资产阶级反动路线搏斗中冲杀出来的，驻浙江六四○九部队和七三五○部队心红眼亮，不约而同地坚决支持这个革命群众组织。在处境十分困难的时候，两支部队一起挺身而出，响亮地向全省人民宣布：我们誓与无产阶级革命派风雨同舟，患难与共！
    有了对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席的“忠”字，斗争越激烈，环境越险恶，就越能团结一致，为保卫毛主席革命路线而共同战斗。在萧山县，有两个连队，同时支持了当地的无产阶级革命派，党内一小撮走资派怕得要命，千方百计地挑拨两个连队之间的关系。两个连队的战士看穿了敌人的阴谋，更加紧紧地团结在一起。他们互通情况，统一看法，互相帮助，互相支援，拧成一股绳，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，彻底粉碎了敌人的阴谋，使萧山地区的无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。
    有了对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席的“忠”字，不同军种，不同单位的部队，就能在思想上、组织上、行动上团结一致。他们在一个工厂支左，一个学校搞军训，一个舞台宣传毛泽东思想，共同学习最新指示，共同总结经验，共同组织学习毛主席著作积极分子作巡回报告。他们相互把对方的党委当作自己的党委，把对方的领导当作自己的领导。两个部队党委，经常一起开会，共同学习贯彻毛主席的最新指示，共同研究解决部队支左工作中的重大问题。
    总之，有了对我们伟大领袖毛主席的“忠”字，团结就有了基础，支左工作就有了保证。驻浙江三军就是在这个基础上结成了战斗的整体，保证了支左工作做到那里，那里就胜利！
  谁毛泽东思想
    红旗举得高
    就向谁学习
    毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，驻浙江部队广泛热烈地开展了互相学习，加强团结的群众性活动。他们说，这是夺取浙江省无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，是加强部队思想革命化的需要，是保卫祖国海防、粉碎美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮进攻的需要。
    谁毛泽东思想红旗举得高，谁捍卫毛主席革命路线最勇敢，谁贯彻毛主席的最新指示最坚决，就向谁学习。这是驻浙江部队广大指战员的共同心愿和行动口号。
    驻杭州六四○九部队某部，在开始支左时，碰到了新情况、新问题，他们便主动向七三五○部队请教，斗争激烈时，几乎每晚都去汇报情况，听取意见。甚至把支左办公室也搬到一起办公。七三五○部队，也把和对方共同战斗的过程，当作向兄弟部队学习的好机会。两个部队，互相学习，互相促进，推动着部队支左工作不断前进。去年九月初，两支部队党委都作出向对方学习的决定，他们把兄弟部队的支左经验和爱民事迹汇编成册，发到部队作活教材。杭州十一中学的军训组，是由两个部队的干部战士共同组成的。这两支部队不仅主动地学，而且热情地帮，互相把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。两支部队的指战员，还牢记毛主席“谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁”的教导，广泛开展了向其他驻浙江兄弟部队学习的活动。他们请坚定地支持舟山地区无产阶级革命派的四二九一部队的同志作报告，他们广泛宣传三个军校的同志用鲜血和生命保卫金华无产阶级革命派的英雄事迹，他们虚心学习海军某部支左小分队顽强斗争的大无畏精神。所有这些，都成为激励这两支部队不断前进的动力。
    驻浙江部队就是这样，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，越学习，越团结；越学习，越热爱毛主席，越忠于毛主席的革命路线。他们在伟大统帅毛主席的统一号令下，思想一致、步调一致，把“三支”“两军”工作做得越来越好。
    全面落实毛主席最新指示，
        坚决支左不支派
    驻浙江部队广大指战员深刻认识到，在毛泽东思想基础上，团结一致，全面落实毛主席最新指示，坚持支左不支派的原则，是做好“三支”“两军”工作的关键。
    从这点出发，他们在任何时候都念念不忘用毛主席最新指示武装自己的头脑，坚决抵制社会上资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响。由七三五○部队和六四○九部队指战员联合组成的一个军训组，刚到杭州市第十二中学搞军训时，正遇到这个学校两派在打
  “内战”。军训组的同志反复学习了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，一起到群众中进行调查研究，一起和革命群众组织促膝谈心，向两派群众进行了深入细致的思想政治工作，使这个学校在毛主席最新指示的指引下，迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    全面落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持支左不支派的原则，关键在于领导。去年冬天，当金华、衢县的无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，实行革命大联合的时候，党内一小撮走资派为了挽救他们即将灭亡的命运，又制造事端，妄图挑拨驻衢县部队和驻金华部队的关系，破坏两县无产阶级革命派的团结。面对这种情况，金华驻军和衢县驻军的领导同志认为，要使部队不上阶级敌人的当，不陷到两派斗争中去，自己必须做出榜样。他们来到兄弟部队的驻地，虚心学习兄弟部队支左不支派的先进经验，向革命群众大力宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示。在领导的带动下，两支部队广大指战员思想更加一致，坚决贯彻支左不支派的原则，引导两县的无产阶级革命派，增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，为毛主席最新指示在两地全面落实共同战斗。阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋被粉碎了，军民团结得更加紧密。不久，两县在同一天成立了革命委员会。
      战斗的集体，红色的长城
    英雄的驻浙江三军，在伟大的毛泽东思想基础上，团结一致，支左不支派，带来了革命派的大团结，带来了军民大团结。使我们的部队和守卫在东海前线的三千一百万英雄儿女，在战争年代建立起来的军民团结的光荣传统，有了崭新的发展。结成了血肉相连、鱼水相依的军民关系。
    去年十月，省工代会筹委会受到资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的冲击。在这关键时刻，七三五○和六四○九部队共同帮助各大系统革命组织负责人开办毛泽东思想学习班。两个部队的领导同志和他们一起学习毛主席有关革命大联合的最新指示，共同斗私批修，对他们的派性耐心诚恳地教育帮助。参加学习班的同志在毛泽东思想的教育下，在部队团结支左的模范行动的影响下，决心向这两支英雄部队学习，坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，背靠背变成了手拉手，争席位变成了让席位。全省工人阶级革命队伍捏成了一个铁拳，胜利召开了省工代会，实现了革命大联合。
    如今，不论你走到那里，到处都可以看到军民团结一致，“生为执行毛主席革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席革命路线而献身”的英雄业绩，到处可以看到军民共同在“一盏灯下学宝书，一条板凳谈思想，一张讲台大批判，一个会上斗私心”的动人情景。毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋，遍及全省各地，毛主席革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心，革命群众的精神面貌，从来没有象今天这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。全省军民发扬冲天的革命干劲，在革命和生产方面都取得了巨大胜利。
