Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the command, the soul. The Chinese Khrushchev, driven by his wolfish ambition to usurp the party and the state and restore capitalism, has always advocated that the central task of our party is to "rapidly develop the productive forces," that party members should only "seriously study their business," and "master various specialized technologies and scientific knowledge." Should we emphasize politics or business? This is the focal point of the two-line struggle in our party and army building.

Our platoon has grown by emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics. Over the past few years, our practical experience has fully proven that the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies are extremely reactionary.

When our platoon was first established, we had heavy tasks and the soldiers' thoughts were very complex. With so many things to do, what should we prioritize first? Our party branch held its first committee meeting to study Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, recognizing that the "Four Firsts" are the direction for our platoon's construction. We focused on politics and on living thoughts, and in the first year of our establishment, we were evaluated as a Four Good Platoon.

In 1963, we set up lines in the high-altitude region. Many comrades had not learned this technology, so could we complete the task? The party branch decided to mobilize the masses for a discussion on "What do we rely on to complete the task?" On the journey, we turned the car into a classroom and launched a wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing the "technology first" viewpoint. Everyone realized: The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always won battles relying on class consciousness and Mao Zedong Thought. During the construction, we insisted on leading with Mao Zedong Thought and completed the task ahead of schedule. Comrades said: "The air is thin on the plateau, but our political air is thick. Chairman Mao's works are the oxygen on the plateau, giving us courage and strength."

In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing blew a "big competition" wind, attempting to sap the soul of our army to achieve his goal of usurping the military and opposing the party. This wind also blew to our platoon. At that time, our platoon sent the Seventh Squad to participate. This squad only focused on military technology and did not even participate in political studies or party and league life. As a result, this squad, which had been a Four Good Squad for three consecutive years, was ruined. In contrast, the other squads in our platoon all went out to work. They insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the construction, focusing on emphasizing politics, focusing on living thoughts, and focusing on revolutionary construction, and were once again evaluated as a Four Good Platoon at the end of the year.

The contrast between emphasizing politics and emphasizing business fully proves: Emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian party and army-building thoughts leads to victory and progress. Without this correct line, like the Chinese Khrushchev, emphasizing business leads to the wrong path and will definitely fail. We summarized our experience and in 1965, successfully completed the task of setting up a large-span overhead line across a river, a task rarely seen in the country. Practice once again proved: The best weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest combat effectiveness is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the smartest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power. We must criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and turn our platoon into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    靠毛泽东思想战胜天险

    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。中国赫鲁晓夫出于他篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的狼子野心，一贯宣扬什么我党的中心工作是“尽快发展生产力”，要党员只“认真钻研业务”，“掌握各种专门技术和科学知识”。突出政治，还是突出业务？这是我们建党、建军中两条路线斗争的焦点。
    我们连队就是靠着突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治成长起来的。几年来，我们的实践经验完全证明了，中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论是极端反动的。
    我们连队刚刚建立时，任务重，战士思想情况很复杂。千头万绪，首先应当抓什么？我们党支部第一次支委会就带着这个问题学习毛主席著作和林副主席指示，认识到“四个第一”是我们连队建设的方向。我们大抓政治，大抓活思想，建连第一年就被评为四好连队。
    一九六三年，我们在高原地区架设线路。许多同志没有学过这种技术，究竟能不能完成任务？党支部决定发动群众进行一次“我们靠什么完成任务”的大讨论。在旅途中，我们把车厢当课堂，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮，彻底批判“技术第一”的观点。大家认识到：中国人民解放军打胜仗从来就是靠阶级觉悟，靠毛泽东思想。在施工中，我们坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，提前完成了任务。同志们说：“高原上空气稀薄，我们的政治空气浓厚。毛主席著作是高原上的氧气，给了我们勇气和力量。”
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，刮起了一股“大比武”的妖风，妄图抽掉我军的灵魂，以达到他篡军反党的目的。这股风也吹到了我们连。当时我连抽七班参加。这个班只搞军事技术，甚至不参加政治学习，不过党团生活。结果，这个连续三年的四好班就被搞垮了。与七班相反，我连其他各班全部外出施工。他们在施工中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓突出政治，狠抓活思想，狠抓革命化的建设，年终再一次被评为四好连队。
    突出政治和突出业务的对比，充分证明：突出无产阶级政治，坚持毛主席的无产阶级建党、建军思想，就胜利，就前进。离开了这条正确的路线，象中国赫鲁晓夫那样去突出业务，就走上歧途，一定失败。我们总结了经验，在一九六五年，胜利地完成了国内少有的大跨距的过河飞线的架设任务。实践再次证明：最好的武器是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量。我们要把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，把连队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
