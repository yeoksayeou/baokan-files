Many workers from the Sana'a Textile Factory in Yemen have taken up arms and rushed to the front lines, actively participating in the struggle against the armed subversion of the Yemeni Republic by U.S. imperialists and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries.

As soon as the U.S. imperialists launched their armed attack on the Arab Republic of Yemen, the workers of the Sana'a Textile Factory volunteered in large numbers to join the people's militia. A workers' militia was quickly established. After a short period of military training, they rushed to the front lines to fight alongside the armed forces and bravely combat the enemy.

During the period of the Yemeni people's self-defense and counterattack war, the administrative head of the Sana'a Textile Factory requested that Chinese technical personnel explain Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" to the factory workers. After listening to Chairman Mao's teachings, the workers expressed their determination to use "Resolutely to carry out the task, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" as their powerful ideological weapon to defeat the enemy and achieve final victory. Participants in the battle, members of the workers' militia, emphasized in a discussion meeting how they had deeply understood through actual struggle the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The imperialists are so arrogant towards us, this needs to be seriously dealt with. We not only need a powerful regular army, we also need to establish a large number of militia regiments. In this way, when the imperialists invade our country, they will find it difficult to move even an inch." Many militia members wore shining Mao badges on their chests, held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and carried guns as they rushed to the front lines.

The female workers and other male workers who remained in the factory also underwent military training to be prepared for armed self-defense if necessary. Thus, the first generation of Yemeni textile female workers not only acquired skilled production techniques but also learned basic military knowledge. When the male militia members went to the front lines, the female workers said, "We will take over your production tasks. To defend the motherland and defeat the enemy, we are willing to work two shifts a day." Although the number of workers in the textile factory has decreased, production has significantly increased. Before the Yemeni people's self-defense and counterattack war, each shift produced 8,000 meters of cloth per day. Now, not only has the quantity of products increased to more than 13,000 meters, but the quality of the products has also improved.

    坚决反击美帝和沙特阿拉伯武装颠覆
    也门萨那纺织厂工人积极投入战斗
    新华社萨那电　也门萨那纺织厂的许多工人拿起枪杆奔赴前线，积极投入反击美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派阴谋武装颠覆也门共和政权的战斗中去。
    当美帝国主义策划的对阿拉伯也门共和国的武装进攻刚一开始，萨那纺织厂的工人们就纷纷报名参加人民自卫队。一支工人自卫队很快地建立起来了。他们经过短期军事训练后，就奔向前线，配合武装部队，英勇杀敌。
    在也门人民进行自卫反击战争期间，萨那纺织厂行政负责人请中国技术人员给纺织厂工人讲解毛主席的“老三篇”。工人们听了毛主席的教导以后，纷纷表示要把“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”作为他们打败敌人、争取最后胜利的强大思想武器。参加过战斗的工人自卫队队员在一次座谈会上，着重谈到他们通过实际斗争，深刻地领会到伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”许多工人自卫队队员胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，扛着枪，奔赴前线。
    留在厂里坚持生产的女工和其余的男工们也进行了军事训练，以便在必要时进行武装自卫。这样，也门第一代纺织女工不仅具有熟练的生产技能，而且也懂得了初步的军事知识。在男工自卫队员开往前线时，女工们表示：“你们的生产任务，我们承担起来。为了保卫祖国，打败敌人，我们一天工作两班也愿意。”现在，纺织厂工人虽然比以前少，但是产量有了显著的提高。在也门人民进行自卫反击战争前，每天每班生产八千米布，现在不但产品数量提高到一万三千多米，而且产品质量也有了提高。
