The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a statement on March 1, calling on all patriotic people and brave armed fighters to, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out armed struggle, and advance victoriously along the great path of the national democratic revolution.

The statement said that in the six years since the establishment of the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, it has consistently and resolutely exposed the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression and the Sarit-Thanon-Praphat clique's betrayal of the country and harm to the people, arousing the people to engage in brave patriotic armed struggle.

The statement pointed out that at present, the patriotic armed struggle to expel the American aggressors and overthrow the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique is flourishing, and the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique is increasingly isolated.

The statement said that facts have proven that the voice from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, which is welcomed by tens of millions of patriotic democratic people and trusted by more and more revolutionary people of various countries, is truly the voice of justice representing the interests of the Thai people, and is the voice that the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique fears the most.

The statement said that the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique's frenzied slander and attacks on the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station show that this radio station has drawn a clear line with the enemy, indicating that its voice has hit the enemy's sore spot and has become a great obstacle to the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique's betrayal and dictatorship that brings harm to the country and the people.

The statement pointed out that such slander and attacks are merely the wails of the reactionaries in the face of the people's revolutionary storm.

The statement expressed that the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station will steadfastly and more closely stand on the side of the patriotic democratic people, resolutely fight against the American aggressors and the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique, and use the voice of justice as a weapon to fight side by side with the armed people, striking at the enemies of the nation and the people.
