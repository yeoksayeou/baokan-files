In the great momentum of the Japanese revolutionary people's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the Mao Zedong Thought Institute was established in Hyogo Prefecture. Representatives enthusiastically hailed the world entering a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, pointing out that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

New China News Agency, March 8th: Tokyo, March 8th: In the great momentum of the Japanese revolutionary people's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to create a great situation to oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto, the Mao Zedong Thought Institute was established on March 3rd in Takarazuka City, Hyogo Prefecture.

The establishment of the Mao Zedong Thought Institute is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese reactionaries, and the Miyamoto revisionist group, who all detest and fear the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought.

The students of the Mao Zedong Thought Institute, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, braved the cold weather and built the institute's buildings with their own hands, brick by brick. During the construction, they received support and encouragement from people all over Japan.

In the afternoon of March 3rd, the Mao Zedong Thought Institute held its opening ceremony. Above the stage was hung the portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of people all over the world. On both sides were posted quotations from Chairman Mao: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow the U.S. imperialists to ride roughshod over it for long." "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning. Learning war from war—this is our main method."

To the tune of the "Internationale," a red school flag with Chairman Mao's portrait was solemnly raised, fluttering in the wind. Workers, youth, women, and representatives from various circles from Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and other parts of Japan, as well as well-known figures in society, gathered with the students of the institute. The entire venue was filled with a heated atmosphere of struggle.

Representatives from the Osaka Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, the Hyogo Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Kyoto Prefectural Headquarters, and Hyogo Prefectural Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), and other mass organizations all spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically congratulating the establishment of the institute. They highly praised Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage.

The representatives hailed that the world has now entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. They pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, the beacon for all revolutionary people of the world, and the brilliant ideology for the proletariat to seize political power and establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The representatives unanimously emphasized that only Mao Zedong Thought can guide the Japanese people to advance along the revolutionary path to victory, overcome U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism, and achieve thorough liberation. The representatives hoped that every student would strive to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, transform their bourgeois worldview, establish a proletarian worldview, go deep among the masses, and deep into the practical struggles. In the struggle, they should study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to sow the seeds of revolution for the Japanese revolution and dedicate themselves to the liberation cause of the Japanese people.

Many representatives also highly praised the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and its extremely great international significance. They praised China as the most reliable and strong fortress for the revolutionary people of the world and shouted: "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

Institute Director Otsuka Yushu spoke at the meeting. He stressed that we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "aim at the target," that is, use Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the target of the Japanese revolution. Otsuka encouraged the students to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for Japan's independence, democracy, and peace. No matter how great the storms they encounter in the future, they must forge ahead bravely.

In the stormy Japanese archipelago, the red hearts of the revolutionary people are all turned towards Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of people all over the world. They enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought as the lighthouse illuminating their path forward.

    毛泽东思想学院的成立，是对仇视和害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想的美帝、苏修、日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团的一个沉重打击。
    毛泽东思想学院的学员们，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，冒着严寒用自己的双手一砖一瓦地修建起这所学院的建筑。在修建过程中，得到了日本全国各地人民的支援和鼓励。
    三日下午，毛泽东思想学院举行开学典礼。会场正面悬挂着全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的画像。两旁张贴着毛主席语录：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”
    在雄壮的国际歌声中，一面有毛主席像的鲜红的校旗，庄严地升起，迎风招展。来自东京、大阪、京都、神户等日本各地的工人、青年、妇女和各界代表以及社会知名人士同学院的学员齐聚一堂，整个会场充满着战斗的热烈气氛。

    代表们欢呼现在全世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。他们指出，毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝修反的最强大的思想武器，是全世界革命人民的指路明灯，是无产阶级武装夺取政权，建立和巩固无产阶级专政的光辉思想。
    代表们一致强调指出，只有毛泽东思想，才能引导日本人民沿着革命的航程胜利前进，战胜美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义，取得彻底的解放。代表们希望每一个学员都努力用毛泽东思想武装头脑，改造资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，深入群众，深入斗争实际，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，为日本革命播撒火种，为日本人民的解放事业献身。
    许多代表在讲话中还高度赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利及其极其伟大的国际意义，称颂中国已经成为全世界革命人民的最可靠的坚强堡垒，并高呼：“伟大的毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    毛泽东思想学院院长大塚有章在会上讲话。他强调指出，我们学习毛泽东思想，必须遵循毛主席的教导，要“有的放矢”，就是用毛泽东思想之“矢”去射日本革命之“的”。大塚勉励学员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为争取日本的独立、民主与和平而奋斗。不管今后遇到多大的风浪，都要勇往直前。（附图片）
