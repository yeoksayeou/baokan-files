Recently, our brigade was influenced by anarchism, and a few members did not observe labor discipline. Some brigade leaders also did not dare to lead boldly, resulting in delayed preparations for production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were very displeased with this situation. They told the cadres: "The key to a year's work lies in the spring. We, as cadres, cannot just seek an easy life and watch production be affected!" Our brigade organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After studying, the brigade and production team cadres had a great change in their thinking. They all took on their responsibilities actively and took the lead in eliminating anarchism. In this way, spring production quickly caught up.

It is understood that some production team cadres are afraid of this and afraid of that, and do not dare to take on responsibilities. Spring production has not been able to get off the ground. We hope that the broad masses of rural grassroots cadres will actively participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously engage in "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism," and bravely take on the two heavy burdens of revolution and production. Those who should manage should manage boldly, and those who should do should do boldly. The broad masses of members should actively support revolutionary cadres in doing their work. With the unity of cadres and the masses, we will grasp revolution, promote production, and fight a good battle in the spring plowing season.

    基层干部要大胆领导生产
    前些日子，我们大队受到无政府主义的影响，有少数社员不遵守劳动纪律，有的生产队干部也不敢大胆领导，结果备耕生产动手比较迟。广大贫下中农对这种现象很有意见，他们对干部说：一年之计在于春，咱们当干部的可不能光图清闲，看着生产受影响啊！我们大队办起了毛泽东思想学习班，大队和生产队干部经过学习，思想大变样，都积极负起责任来，带头铲除无政府主义。这样，春耕生产很快就赶上来了。
    据了解，还有些生产队的干部前怕龙，后怕虎，不敢挑担子，春耕生产迟迟抓不起来。我们希望广大农村基层干部积极参加毛泽东思想学习班学习，认真“斗私，批修”，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。该管的要大胆去管，该做的要大胆去做。广大社员要积极支持革命干部做好工作。干群一条心，抓革命，促生产，打好春耕这一仗。
