Fully Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Keep Pace with the Advanced Steps of the National Revolutionary Masses

The Revolutionary Committees of Wuxi and Xuzhou Cities Born in Victory

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 7th

The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, kept pace with the advanced steps of the national proletarian revolutionary masses, and accelerated the process of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the city. Currently, revolutionary great unity has been achieved in all factories, schools, and offices in the city. Based on this great unity, the Wuxi City Revolutionary Committee was born in victory on March 4th. On that day, more than 200,000 revolutionary soldiers and civilians in the city held a grand meeting to celebrate the establishment of the city's Revolutionary Committee.

The victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Wuxi City is the result of the broad proletarian revolutionary masses fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The two factions in this city had, in the past, been incited by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and social demons to harbor bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, with serious antagonistic sentiments and prolonged "internal wars," making the progress of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination very slow. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, change the backward situation, and accelerate the pace of progress, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's "three supports, two militaries" personnel, more than 2,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up throughout the city, with more than 100,000 revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres participating in the study. The entire city has formed a mass movement to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have carried forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, as advocated by Chairman Mao, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to solve problems in revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and achieving immediate results by learning a little and using a little.

In the process of achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism once became an obstacle to the movement. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres launched a "people's war" to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Whenever factionalism reared its head, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely, resolutely, and thoroughly suppress it. In the struggle to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they all vied to achieve new merits, thus creating a situation where leaders led the masses, the masses urged the leaders, and great efforts were made to promote revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. In some units where the two factions had serious antagonistic sentiments, the representatives of both sides, who were originally sent to discuss unity issues, solved the problem of achieving revolutionary great unity under the supervision of the revolutionary masses and also solved the problem of establishing a revolutionary preparatory committee or a revolutionary committee.

In the mass movement to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and keep pace with the advanced steps of the national proletarian revolutionary masses, the working class of Wuxi City played a model and leading role. They implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions the fastest and most resolutely overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. In the torrent of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, they were always at the forefront. By the time the city's Revolutionary Committee was established, 95% of the factories and enterprises in the city had achieved revolutionary great unity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 7th

The proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, have made great efforts to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and achieved great victories in revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. On March 1st, the Xuzhou City Revolutionary Committee was announced, and 200,000 soldiers and civilians in the city held a grand rally to celebrate the birth of the proletarian revolutionary power.

Currently, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Xuzhou City is excellent, and all fronts are presenting a new and inspiring situation.

Chairman Mao teaches, "Setting up study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in the study classes." The broad proletarian revolutionary masses of Xuzhou City, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Currently, the city has set up more than 3,900 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with 140,000 people participating in the study. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses, with their proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, have studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions seriously and deeply in the study classes, taking "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" as the key, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," suppressing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit. In many study classes, proletarian revolutionary masses and deceived masses have recalled past sufferings and joys together, making the revolutionary masses realize that they have the responsibility to help the deceived masses and cannot discriminate against or suppress them; the deceived masses also realize that they have been used by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and class enemies, treating class brothers as enemies is wrong. Through criticizing the self, opposing revisionism, and class education, the antagonistic sentiments among the masses have been eliminated, unity has been strengthened, and a high tide of great unity has quickly emerged. Currently, the vast majority of units in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity by system, department, and class.

Chairman Mao teaches, "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be solved." The proletarian revolutionary masses of Xuzhou City, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and help cadres who have made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Since last December, the revolutionary masses of the city, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have fully mobilized the masses, adopting a combination of internal and external meetings and top-down methods, to fully review the entire history and work of the original municipal committee and municipal people's committee leaders, allowing cadres to stand out in the great waves of mass struggle, fully accepting the criticism and help of the masses, and liberating many leading cadres. The original first secretary of the municipal committee, Han Benchu, and the original mayor, Wu Mingzhen, were also liberated and were invited to participate in the temporary power organ of the three-in-one combination, serving as deputy chairmen of the municipal Revolutionary Committee. Revolutionary committees have also been established in many grassroots units throughout the city.

The revolutionary masses of Xuzhou have also actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," continuously overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, strengthening proletarian party spirit and revolutionary discipline, making the industrial and agricultural production of the city present a good situation. The revolutionary workers of the coal system in the city go down the mine early and come out late, striving to improve labor productivity. The coal production in January increased by 10.3% compared to December last year, and in February, it increased by another 4.1% compared to January. The revolutionary masses of the Xuzhou Railway Bureau and the revolutionary masses of the city have cooperated closely, completing the passenger and freight transportation tasks excellently during the Spring Festival, and the transportation tasks in February have also been completed well.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xuzhou has, in the "three supports, two militaries" work, seriously implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting the factions, and has made immortal contributions to the Cultural Revolution in the Xuzhou region.

    全面落实毛主席最新指示　紧追全国革命派先进步伐
    无锡市徐州市革命委员会胜利诞生
    新华社南京七日电　江苏省无锡市无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在人民解放军的帮助下，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧追全国无产阶级革命派的先进步伐，加快了全市革命大联合和革命三结合的进程。目前，全市工厂、学校、机关分别实现了革命大联合。在大联合的基础上，无锡市革命委员会已在三月四日胜利诞生。这一天，全市革命军民二十多万人举行大会，热烈庆祝市革委会的成立。
    无锡市无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进，是广大无产阶级革命派落实毛主席最新指示的结果。这个市的两大派过去由于党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神的挑动，自己本身存在着资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，对立情绪严重，“内战”长期不休，革命大联合和革命三结合的进展十分迟缓。为了全面落实毛主席的最新指示，改变落后状况，加快前进步伐，在中国人民解放军“三支”“两军”人员的帮助下，全市办起了二千多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的革命群众和革命干部达十多万人次，全市形成了一个全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动。在学习班里，广大革命群众和革命干部发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，用毛主席的最新指示来解决革命大联合和革命三结合中的问题，坚持学一点，用一点，取得了立竿见影的效果。
    在实现革命大联合和革命三结合的过程中，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性一度成为运动的绊脚石，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众展开了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”。派性一露头，他们就用毛泽东思想为武器，狠狠地打，坚决地打，彻底地打。他们在围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争中纷纷争取立新功，从而出现了头头带群众，群众促头头，大力促进革命大联合和革命三结合的大好局面。有些两派对立情绪严重的单位，本来双方派出代表是商谈联合的问题，在革命群众的督促下，不但解决了实现革命大联合的问题，而且解决了成立革筹小组或革命委员会的问题。
    在落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧追全国无产阶级革命派先进步伐的群众运动中，无锡市的工人阶级起了模范作用和主导作用。他们落实毛主席最新指示的速度最快，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性最坚决。在革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流中，他们一直跑在最前头。到市革命委员会成立时为止，全市百分之九十五的工厂企业都已实现了革命大联合。
  据新华社南京七日电　江苏省徐州市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，努力克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，取得了革命大联合和革命三结合的伟大胜利。三月一日，徐州市革命委员会宣告成立，全市二十万军民举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝无产阶级革命政权的诞生。
    目前，徐州市文化大革命形势一派大好，各条战线都呈现出令人鼓舞的新气象。
    毛主席教导说，“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”徐州市广大无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席的指示，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新高潮。目前全市已开办毛泽东思想学习班三千九百多个，参加学习的达十四万人。广大无产阶级革命派怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，在学习班里认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的一系列最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。在许多学习班里，无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽的群众共同忆苦思甜，使革命派认识到，对受蒙蔽的群众，只有帮助的责任，而不能歧视、压制；受蒙蔽的群众也认识到，自己受了党内一小撮走资派和阶级敌人的利用，把阶级兄弟当作敌人来对待是错误的。通过斗私批修和阶级教育，消除了群众之间的对立情绪，加强了团结，迅速出现了大联合的高潮。目前全市绝大多数单位已经按系统、按部门、按班级实现了革命大联合。
    毛主席教导说，“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”徐州市无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正确执行毛主席的干部政策，帮助犯错误干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来。从去年十二月份以来，全市革命派遵循毛主席的教导，充分发动群众，采取会内会外结合，上下结合的方法，全面审查了原市委、市人委领导干部的全部历史和全部工作，让干部在群众斗争的大风浪里亮相，充分接受群众的批评帮助，使许多领导干部得到了解放。原市委第一书记韩本初和原市长吴明政也得到解放，并被吸收参加了三结合的临时权力机构，担任了市革委会副主任的职务。全市很多基层单位的革命委员会也纷纷建立起来。
    徐州革命派还积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，不断克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性和革命纪律性，使全市工农业生产呈现出一片大好景象。全市煤炭系统的革命职工早下井，晚上井，努力提高劳动生产率。一月份煤炭产量比去年十二月份提高百分之十点三，二月份又比一月份提高百分之四点一。徐州铁路分局的革命派和全市革命派密切协作，春节期间出色地完成了客、货运任务，二月份运输任务也完成得很好。
    人民解放军驻徐州部队在“三支”“两军”工作中，认真执行支左不支派的原则，为徐州地区的文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
