Since the meeting between Kosygin and Johnson in Glassboro last June, the Soviet revisionist leadership has shamelessly colluded with American imperialism, relentlessly betraying the interests of the world's people, and eagerly serving the reactionary global strategy of Washington. Recently, the head of the American imperialists, Johnson, in his "State of the Union" address to the U.S. Congress, openly expressed his satisfaction with the "progress" made in the anti-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union since the Glassboro talks. Johnson's remarks are a commendation of the traitorous Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, who have been actively serving as the number one henchmen of the American imperialists for over half a year.

The Glassboro talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union last year were held under the backdrop of the booming Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, the victorious advances of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, and the surging anti-imperialist revolutionary movements in the Middle East and other parts of the world, making life increasingly difficult for both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Through the secret talks in Glassboro, the U.S. and the Soviet Union reached agreements and tacit understandings on many major international issues, jointly plotting to oppose China, suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people worldwide, and particularly to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Thus, they pushed the U.S.-Soviet collusion to a new stage.

Since the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionist leadership, following Johnson's directive to expand the "areas of joint action" between the Soviet Union and the U.S., has further aligned its foreign policy with the U.S.'s reactionary global strategy. They have been closely following the U.S., step by step, in close coordination, joining forces with the U.S. to form an anti-China, anti-revolutionary "holy alliance," sabotaging the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war; aiding the American aggressors in their plan to force Arab countries to fully surrender to the U.S. and Israel, and expanding Soviet-U.S. political, economic, and cultural collusion to military cooperation.

In the Glassboro talks, Kosygin and Johnson plotted new conspiracies to jointly oppose China. Both the Soviet revisionists and the American imperialists have always viewed the increasingly powerful socialist China as the main obstacle to their reactionary collusion and their common enemy. After the Glassboro black meeting, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, to realize the global "package deal" they reached with Johnson, have been more shameless and arrogant in their anti-China propaganda and in forming an anti-China encirclement, collaborating more closely with Washington than ever before.

During this period, the Soviet revisionist leadership has spread anti-China rumors with the American imperialists, exchanged anti-China materials, and jointly slandered China, viciously attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has been warmly praised by revolutionary people worldwide. They have continuously created anti-China provocations and, together with the American imperialists, instigated and supported the reactionaries in some countries around China to create anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents. Wherever the reactionaries stirred up anti-China waves, they fanned the flames and openly cheered. Whenever a country's ruling clique was hostile to China, they did everything they could to "cooperate" and build relationships. After the Ne Win reactionary clique in Burma committed fascist atrocities against China in June and July last year, the Soviet revisionists came out to support them and almost simultaneously provided new military "aid" to the Ne Win clique with the U.S. Towards the rabidly anti-China military fascist regime in Indonesia and the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress, the Soviet revisionists and the American imperialists provided extensive support from all sides, fueling their anti-China fervor. After the Indian reactionaries, instigated by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, launched a military attack on China in the Sino-Indian border in September, they sang in unison with the U.S., exonerating the Indian reactionaries of their crimes and providing them with further economic and military "aid."

Meanwhile, the traitorous and scab clique in the Kremlin further intensified their comprehensive collusion with the Sato government in Japan and accelerated their infiltration into Southeast Asia. In November last year, they formally announced the establishment of so-called ambassador-level "diplomatic relations" with the Rahman puppet clique, a tool of American and British imperialism in "Malaysia." By the end of last year, with the tacit approval and matchmaking of Washington, the Soviet revisionists had hooked up with almost all the lackeys and servants of the American imperialists around China, making significant efforts to realize the "common cause" of the U.S.-Soviet partnership in building an anti-China encirclement around China.

The Vietnam issue was an important political transaction item in the secret talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Glassboro. Although the Soviet revisionists have tried to cover up their traitorous face of betraying the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people and serving the American aggressors, their criminal acts are as clear as day.

Soon after the end of the Glassboro black meeting, American imperialism quickly played its reactionary two-pronged strategy again: on the one hand, it continued to send more troops to South Vietnam, escalated and intensified its bombing of North Vietnam, plotting to "force a surrender with war" and "coerce with bombs"; on the other hand, it waved the flag of "bombing halt," deceiving and cheating. The Soviet revisionist leadership eagerly cooperated with both of Washington's war and peace tactics. Over the past few months, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have used their propaganda machinery to cooperate with Washington's war "escalation" in Vietnam, relentlessly hyping the "terror" of the Vietnam War and the "destruction" it caused to Vietnam, attempting to pressure the Vietnamese people to succumb to American war threats and accept the American "peace" deception. At the same time, they frequently traveled between Washington, Moscow, Tokyo, New Delhi, and other places with American politicians and various "peace" brokers, pushing forward the American "peace" conspiracy. In September last year, they even attempted to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue with the U.S., realizing the American plot of "bombing halt and deception."

Since the end of last year, the Johnson administration, facing continuous failures in the Vietnam War and the approaching U.S. elections, has stirred up a new wave of "peace" talk. This time, the Soviet revisionists cooperated even more eagerly and acted more urgently. Around the New Year, Brezhnev and Kosygin personally made speeches to foreign journalists, emphasizing the need for "bombing halt and peace talks." In mid-December last year and January this year, they held secret meetings in Moscow with the main presidential candidate of the U.S. Republican Party, Romney, and the British Prime Minister Wilson, on the Vietnam issue. As soon as Wilson left the Soviet Union, Kosygin hurried to New Delhi, where he conspired with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Yugoslav traitor Tito on the so-called "political solution" to the Vietnam issue. Immediately after that, they also held secret talks in Moscow with the American lackey and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, sending him away with a new "peace prescription" for Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist traitors have been so busy promoting the American "peace" conspiracy, once again exposing their ugly faces as faithful servants and henchmen of the Americans.

In the Middle East issue, over the past half year, the Soviet revisionists have followed the Americans, using every means to implement the secret agreement between Johnson and Kosygin in Glassboro, attempting to further force Arab countries to kneel and surrender to the American and Israeli aggressors. After the Middle East incident in June last year, the Soviet revisionist clique, to cover up their shameful face of betraying the Arab people, proposed, under the pretext of "supporting" Arab countries, to hold an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East issue. Due to the manipulation of the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy in Glassboro, the assembly did not pass any resolution condemning the American and Israeli aggressors, nor did it support the just demand of the Arab people for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories they have occupied. After the assembly ended, the Soviet revisionist clique, on the one hand, took advantage of the difficulties faced by Arab countries after the war, infiltrating the Middle East region under the pretext of "aid"; on the other hand, in collusion with the Americans, applied pressure on Arab countries through various channels, coercing them to accept humiliating conditions.

The resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council meeting in late November to force Arab countries to fully surrender was the result of the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the Americans and their frequent behind-the-scenes activities within and outside the United Nations. The resolution did not demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops but required the invaded Arab countries to recognize the legitimacy of Israeli aggression and allow Israel to occupy more Arab territories, ensuring the so-called "freedom of navigation" in the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran, and so on.

This resolution, which was passed under the manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was superficially labeled as British, but it was actually a filthy product of the secret deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Glassboro and the one they had been pushing hard for in the subsequent few months. Before the resolution was passed, the Soviet revisionists had proposed a hypocritical resolution demanding the withdrawal of Israeli troops. But just two days later, when the American representative expressed that the British resolution was "completely in line" with American policy, the Soviet representative hastily withdrew their own resolution and turned to support the British resolution with the Americans. After the resolution was passed, the Soviet revisionists again supported the Americans in sending a "special envoy" to the Middle East to induce Arab countries to accept the resolution. The Soviet revisionist traitors have been so blatantly following the Americans, showing how degenerate they have become.

Through the secret plotting in Glassboro, the Soviet revisionists and the American imperialists have been increasingly blatant in their anti-revolutionary military collusion, targeting China and the revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

Even before the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionist clique had been enthusiastically advocating the so-called "relaxation" of the European situation and taking corresponding measures. The main purpose was to maintain the reactionary "order" in Europe with the imperialist countries led by the United States, helping the Americans to redeploy more military forces to suppress the national liberation movements of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, expand the war in Vietnam, and strengthen anti-China military deployments. The American imperialists highly praised the Soviet revisionist traitors' actions and actively responded. After the Glassboro meeting, the Soviet revisionists further took "joint actions" with the Americans and other Western countries on this issue. In December last year, the ministerial council meeting of the North Atlantic invasionist bloc led by the United States, based on the "evolution" of the Soviet revisionist clique's policy towards the West, modified the political and military strategies of the bloc, announcing the reduction of the bloc's troops in Western Europe from the originally planned 30 divisions to 20 divisions, and approving the further reduction of American troops in West Germany by the Americans to alleviate the Americans' desperate situation of heavy casualties and manpower shortage on the Vietnam battlefield. The communiqué issued after the meeting also encouraged the Soviet revisionists to further cooperate with the American military's plan to move eastward, achieving a "balanced reduction of troops" in Europe.

On the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," the Soviet revisionists have been colluding with the Americans for five years to reach a deal, aiming to maintain nuclear monopoly, promote nuclear blackmail, and prevent China from acquiring nuclear weapons. After China successfully tested nuclear weapons in succession, they became even more anxious to finalize the deal with the Americans as soon as possible. After the secret plotting in Glassboro in June last year, the Soviet revisionist clique accelerated their pace of collusion with the Americans on this issue. After repeated concessions and compromises by the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. and the Soviet Union successively submitted to the Geneva 17-nation "disarmament" conference their jointly drafted draft treaty and comprehensive draft for the "prevention of nuclear proliferation." This draft openly stipulates that peace-loving countries are not allowed to develop and possess nuclear weapons for self-defense, nor are they allowed to develop nuclear facilities in the peaceful use of atomic energy, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union can develop nuclear weapons without restrictions. This shows how urgently the Soviet revisionists, out of reactionary political and military needs, have been colluding with the Americans.

Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionists and the Americans have been terrified by the astonishing progress of socialist China in developing missiles and nuclear weapons, and in recent years, they have been actively plotting to use their own nuclear weapons to "contain" China. During the collusion in Glassboro, they also reached a "consensus" on this issue and accelerated the preparation to implement this reactionary plan. In September last year, the U.S. government openly announced that it would begin establishing an anti-ballistic missile system targeting China by the end of 1967. The U.S. ruling clique had previously informed Moscow of this situation and later openly advocated for a deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on nuclear attacks and "nuclear defense." The Soviet revisionist traitors actively cooperated with the American anti-China conspiracy. According to official U.S. sources and news agencies, they were also deploying an anti-ballistic missile system targeting China. The U.S. and the Soviet Union, in unison, each set up an anti-missile network targeting China, further exposing that the Soviet revisionists have, in fact, formed a military alliance with the Americans against China.

From Khrushchev's 1959 meeting with Eisenhower in Camp David and their open collusion against the world revolution to now, the Soviet revisionist leadership has followed a path of increasing betrayal and degeneration. The Glassboro talks are a new milestone on this path. The world has seen that the Soviet revisionist clique has been acting according to the global reactionary conspiracy they plotted with Johnson in Glassboro over the past half year, faithfully serving the Americans. They have been more subservient to the Americans, more closely following, and more actively serving than Khrushchev did in his time.

The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own destruction. The awakening of the masses of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the people within imperialist countries themselves is such a condition." The Soviet revisionist clique, like imperialism, is doing stupid things that lead to its own destruction. For many years, they have been flattering, colluding with, and surrendering to the Americans, collaborating with the Americans to oppose China, communism, the people, and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people in various countries, playing a role in promoting the increasing awakening of the people worldwide and the Soviet people, thus preparing the conditions for their own destruction. Since the Glassboro black meeting, the traitorous acts of the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have been more exposed, further accelerating their destruction.

Today, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggles of the world's people are thriving and surging. Whether it is the world's number one enemy, American imperialism, or the number one henchman of the Americans, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, they will inevitably face historical retribution.

    世界人民革命洪流汹涌澎湃  苏修集团逃脱不了历史惩罚
    苏修极力出卖世界人民利益为美帝反革命全球战略效劳只能加速自己灭亡
    新华社二十九日讯　本社记者报道：自从去年六月柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗举行会谈以来，苏修领导集团空前露骨地同美帝国主义勾结在一起，极力出卖世界人民的利益，十分起劲地为华盛顿的反革命全球战略效劳。美帝头子约翰逊不久前在向美国国会提出的“国情咨文”里毫不掩饰地表示，他对葛拉斯堡罗会谈后美苏反革命全球大勾结所取得的“进展”“感到很鼓舞”。约翰逊的这番话，正是对半年多来积极充当美帝头号帮凶的勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团的夸奖。
    去年美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈，是在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃发展，越南人民抗美救国战争节节胜利，中东和世界其他地区的反帝革命运动日益高涨，美帝和苏修的日子越来越不好混的形势下举行的。通过葛拉斯堡罗密谈，美帝和苏修在许多重大国际问题上达成了协议和默契，共同策划了反对中国，镇压世界各国人民革命斗争，特别是镇压亚非拉民族解放运动的阴谋，从而把苏美勾结推进到了一个新的阶段。
    在葛拉斯堡罗会谈以来，苏修领导集团遵照约翰逊关于扩大苏美“共同行动的领域”的旨意，进一步把自己的外交政策纳入了美帝反革命全球战略的轨道。他们跟在华盛顿的屁股后面，亦步亦趋，密切配合，同美国一起拼凑反华、反革命的“神圣同盟”，破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争；帮助美国侵略者实现它迫使阿拉伯国家向美国和以色列全面投降的计划，并把苏美之间的政治、经济、文化勾结扩大到军事方面的“合作”。
    同美帝相互配合共同进行反华勾当
    柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗举行的会谈中，策划了共同反华的新阴谋。苏修美帝一向都把日益强大的社会主义中国当作他们进行反革命勾结的主要障碍，看成是他们的共同敌人。葛拉斯堡罗黑会后，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团为了实现同约翰逊达成的全球性“一揽子交易”，在反华宣传和在拼凑反华包围圈方面干得空前露骨、空前嚣张，同华盛顿相互唱和、彼此合作得也空前紧密了。
    在这期间，苏修领导集团同美帝互相传播反华谣言，互相转载反华材料，共同竭力诬蔑中国，恶毒攻击受到全世界革命人民热烈赞扬的中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们不断制造反华挑衅，并且同美帝一起策动和支持中国周围一些国家的反动派制造反华排华事端。那里的反动派掀起反华浪潮，他们就推波助澜，公开拍手叫好。那个国家的统治集团敌视中国，他们就千方百计同它们搞“合作”，拉关系。去年六、七月缅甸奈温反动集团在国内制造反华法西斯暴行后，苏修出台为之助威，而且差不多同美国同时向奈温集团提供新的军事“援助”。对一贯猖狂反华的印尼军人法西斯政权和印度国大党反动政府，苏修和美帝也从各方面大力给予支持，助长其反华气焰。去年九月印度反动派在美帝苏修的策动下，在中印边境向中国发动武装进攻后，他们与美帝同唱一个调子，为印度反动派开脱罪责，并对它进一步提供经济和军事“援助”。
    与此同时，克里姆林宫的叛徒、工贼集团进一步加紧了同日本佐藤政府的全面勾结，并加紧向东南亚地区渗透。去年十一月，他们正式宣布同美英帝国主义的工具——“马来西亚”的拉赫曼傀儡集团建立了所谓大使级“外交关系”。这样，到去年年底，在华盛顿的默许和撮合下，苏修同中国周围几乎所有美帝的走狗和仆从都挂上了钩，为实现苏美合伙在中国周围建立反华包围圈的“共同事业”卖了很大的力气。
    配合美帝破坏越南人民抗美救国战争
    越南问题是苏美在葛拉斯堡罗密谈中的一个重要政治交易项目。尽管苏修极力掩盖他们出卖越南人民革命利益，为美国侵略者效劳的叛徒面目，但是他们的罪恶行径却是铁证如山。
    葛拉斯堡罗黑会结束后不久，美帝国主义很快就再一次玩弄起反革命两手政策：一方面继续增兵越南南方，扩大和加紧对越南北方的轰炸，阴谋“以战压降”、“以炸迫和”；另一方面挥舞“停炸”的破旗，招摇撞骗。对于华盛顿的战“和”两手，苏修领导集团都热心地予以配合。几个月来，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团开动他们的宣传机器，配合华盛顿在越南的战争
  “升级”，拚命渲染越南战争“恐怖”，渲染战争给越南造成的“破坏”，企图压越南人民屈服于美国的战争威胁，接受美国的“和谈”骗局。同时，他们同美国的政客及其形形色色的“和谈”掮客，频繁往来于华盛顿、莫斯科、东京、新德里等地，加紧推行美国的“和谈”阴谋。去年九月，他们甚至同美国一起妄图利用联合国干涉越南问题，实现美国“停炸诱和”的阴谋。
    去年年底以来，约翰逊政府迫于美帝在越南战争中不断失败和美国大选日益逼近，又煽起了一阵新的“和谈”阴风。这一次，苏修配合得更加起劲，活动得更加紧张了。新年前后，勃列日涅夫和柯西金分别亲自出马，向外国记者发表谈话，强调要“停炸和谈”。去年十二月中旬和今年一月，他们在莫斯科先后同美国共和党的主要总统候选人罗姆尼和英国首相威尔逊就越南问题进行了一番密谋策划。威尔逊刚一离开苏联，柯西金又连忙赶到新德里，同印度总理英迪拉·甘地和南斯拉夫大叛徒铁托一起密谋所谓越南问题的“政治解决”。紧接着，最近他们又在莫斯科同美国的走卒、联合国秘书长吴丹密商，让他带走了一个新的越南“和平处方”。苏修叛徒们这样卖力为美帝的“和谈”阴谋而奔忙，再一次暴露了他们充当美国忠实奴仆和帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
  紧紧追随美帝极力迫使阿拉伯人民投降
    在中东问题上，半年多来苏修一直追随美帝，千方百计推行约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的秘密协议，妄图进一步迫使阿拉伯国家向美国和以色列侵略者屈膝投降。在去年六月中东事件以后，苏修集团为了掩饰自己空前露骨地出卖阿拉伯人民的可耻面目，打着所谓“支持”阿拉伯国家的幌子，煞有介事地提议召开联合国大会紧急会议讨论中东问题。由于美苏在葛拉斯堡罗的合谋操纵，这次大会既没有通过任何谴责美以侵略者的决议，也没有支持阿拉伯人民要以色列军队从他们霸占的阿拉伯领土上撤退的正义呼声。大会结束以后，苏修集团一面利用阿拉伯国家战后所面临的困难，在“援助”的幌子下加紧向中东地区渗透；一面同美帝串通一气，通过各种渠道，向阿拉伯国家施加压力，胁迫阿拉伯国家进一步接受丧权辱国的条件。
    去年十一月下旬联合国安全理事会会议通过逼迫阿拉伯国家全面投降的英国提案，就是苏修勾结美帝，在联合国内外进行频繁的幕后活动的结果。提案根本没有要求以色列立即和无条件撤军，却要求被侵略的阿拉伯国家承认以色列侵略的合法化，并且让以色列霸占更多的阿拉伯领土，保证苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡的所谓“通航自由”等等。
    这个在美苏操纵下通过的提案，表面上贴着英国商标，实际上是美苏在葛拉斯堡罗秘密成交、并在随后几个月中拚命推销的肮脏货色。在通过这个提案以前，苏修曾提出过一个假惺惺地要以色列撤军的提案。但仅仅过了两天，当美国代表表示英国的提案“完全符合”美国政策的时候，苏修代表就急急忙忙撤销了自己的提案，转而同美国一起支持英国提案。而在会议通过了英国提案以后，苏修又同美帝一致支持联合国派“特使”到中东活动，诱迫阿拉伯国家接受这个提案。苏修叛徒们如此毫不掩饰地紧紧追随美国，可见他们已经堕落到了何等卑鄙的地步。
      同美帝空前露骨地进行军事勾结
    经过葛拉斯堡罗的密谋策划，苏修和美帝越来越露骨地进行矛头针对中国、针对世界人民革命斗争的反革命军事勾结。
    早在葛拉斯堡罗会谈以前，苏修集团就十分起劲地鼓吹所谓“缓和”欧洲局势，并为此采取了相应的措施。其主要目的就是同以美国为首的帝国主义国家一道，共同维护他们在欧洲的反革命“秩序”，以便帮助美帝抽调出更多的军事力量，去镇压亚、非、拉人民的民族解放运动，扩大侵越战争和加强反华军事部署。美帝对苏修叛徒的这种作法大为赞赏，积极策应。在葛拉斯堡罗会晤以后，苏修在这个问题上进一步与美国及其他西方国家采取“共同行动”。去年十二月以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团部长理事会会议，根据苏修集团对西方政策的这种“演变”，修改了这个集团的政治和军事战略，宣布要把这个侵略集团驻西欧的部队从原定的三十个师减少到二十个师，并且批准美帝进一步减少在西德的驻军，以摆脱美帝在侵越战场上伤亡惨重、兵员枯竭的狼狈处境。会后发表的公报还鼓励苏修进一步配合美帝军事力量东移的计划，在欧洲“双方平衡地裁减部队”。
    在“防止核扩散”问题上，五年来苏修一直同美帝策划搞成一项交易，以便保持核垄断，推行核讹诈，阻止中国掌握核武器。中国连续试验核武器成功以后，他们气急败坏，更加急于早日和美国拍板成交。去年六月葛拉斯堡罗密谋以后，苏修集团在这个问题上同美帝勾结的步伐进一步加快了。经过苏修一再作出妥协让步，美苏先后在去年八月和今年一月向日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议抛出了他们合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案和全面草案。这个草案公然规定，爱好和平的国家不得发展和拥有自卫的核武器，甚至不得在和平利用原子能方面发展核装置，相反却让美苏两家可以不受约束地发展核武器。这就表明，苏修出于反革命的政治和军事需要，多么迫不及待地同美帝进一步勾结在一起。
    与此同时，苏修和美帝被社会主义中国发展导弹和核武器的惊人进展吓破了胆，近年来积极策划要用自己的核武器来“遏制”中国。在葛拉斯堡罗勾结期间，他们在这个问题上也取得了“默契”，加紧准备把这个反革命计划付诸实现。去年九月，美国政府公开宣布要在一九六七年底着手建立针对中国的“反弹道导弹系统”。美国统治集团事前曾经把这个情况通知莫斯科，事后又公开鼓吹美苏两家就核进攻和“核防御”问题达成交易。苏修叛徒们积极配合美帝的这个反华阴谋，据美国官方和通讯社透露，他们也在部署矛头针对中国的“反弹道导弹系统”。美苏两家这样步调一致地各自设置针对中国的反导弹网，这就更加清楚地暴露了苏修已经在事实上同美帝结成了反对中国的军事同盟。
    苏修叛徒绝对逃脱不了应得的惩罚
    从赫鲁晓夫一九五九年同艾森豪威尔在戴维营会谈和公开合伙反对世界革命到现在，苏修领导集团经历了一条越来越卑鄙、越来越堕落的叛卖道路。葛拉斯堡罗会谈，就是苏修叛徒在这条道路上越走越远的一个新的路标。全世界都看到，苏修集团半年多来一直按照他们同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗策划的苏美全球性反革命阴谋进行活动，忠心耿耿地为美帝服务。他们对美帝奴颜婢膝，紧紧追随，积极效劳，比赫鲁晓夫当年走得更远，更加卑鄙无耻。
      世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。”苏修叛徒集团同帝国主义一样，也在干着自取灭亡的蠢事。多年来，他们媚美、联美、降美，配合美帝反华、反共、反人民、镇压各国人民的革命斗争，起了不断促进全世界人民和苏联人民日益觉悟的作用，因而也就不断地给自己准备着灭亡的条件。葛拉斯堡罗黑会以来，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团的叛徒行径暴露得更加清楚了，这就进一步加速了他们的灭亡。
      今天，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，世界人民的革命斗争蓬勃发展，日益高涨。不管是世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义，还是美帝的头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团，都绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。
