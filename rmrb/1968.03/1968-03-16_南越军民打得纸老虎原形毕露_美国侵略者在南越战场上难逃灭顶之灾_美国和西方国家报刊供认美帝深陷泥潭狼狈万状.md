The people and soldiers of South Vietnam, with the immense power of their people's war, have struck the U.S. aggressors, making them flee in disarray and utter disarray. The over 500,000 U.S. aggressors on the South Vietnamese battlefield are experiencing unprecedented low morale, with a sense of despair spreading like a plague among the American soldiers. The U.S. troops trapped in isolated outposts are like turtles in a jar, huddled in their fortifications, passively taking blows. Regarding this, bourgeois newspapers and news agencies in the U.S. and other Western countries cannot hide the truth. They have recently been continuously lamenting the plight of the U.S. aggressors on the South Vietnamese battlefield, inadvertently exposing the weak nature of U.S. imperialism's paper tiger.

Soldiers Lack Fighting Spirit; Even Grass and Trees Seem Like Enemies

The U.S. imperialists, having sent troops across the ocean to invade South Vietnam, have inevitably determined that this war is unpopular and that their soldiers lack fighting spirit. The recent powerful Tet Offensive by the people and soldiers of South Vietnam has further exacerbated the low morale and war-weariness among the U.S. aggressors. The British newspaper *The Sun* reported from Saigon that the U.S. military is "mired in tension and fear." It wrote: "American soldiers all have pale and tired faces, always sleeping in bulletproof flight suits." An air force colonel said: "It (referring to the Tet Offensive) keeps one's nerves on edge, so even the smallest thing can make you uneasy."

A British photographer accompanying the U.S. Marine Corps in Hue reported that he saw American soldiers "each fearing for their own lives, worried that the second bullet might hit them." The photographer lamented, "The morale of the Marine Corps seems to be extremely low." "Everyone's nerves are extremely tense," they "pray to God to protect them so they can retreat alive."

Trapped and Helpless

During the Tet Offensive, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam annihilated and disintegrated a large number of enemy forces, further liberating vast rural areas in the south, forcing the U.S. and puppet forces to retreat into cities and isolated outposts. Meanwhile, more and more outposts have fallen into the encirclement of the southern people and soldiers. On the other hand, under the frequent and widespread offensives of the southern people and soldiers, the U.S. imperialists have had to dispatch large numbers of troops to various places for "emergencies," further exacerbating the sharp contradiction between their overextended front lines and insufficient manpower, making their strategic weakness even more pronounced.

Agence France-Presse reported that in northern South Vietnam, "most roads are controlled by the communists (referring to the People's Liberation Armed Forces), making them impassable. Roads that were considered safe at the end of last year are now extremely dangerous." The German newspaper *Frankfurter Rundschau* reported that vast rural areas are "controlled by the Viet Cong (referring to the People's Liberation Armed Forces)." "The bases of Yu Ling, Kun Tian, and Xi Shan are hanging in the air, and their supply base Dong He is like an island floating in a red sea."

Although the U.S. has over 500,000 troops on the South Vietnamese battlefield, these "soft soldiers" not only lack combat effectiveness but also require a large number of personnel to maintain their logistics. According to Western newspapers, for every U.S. soldier on the front line, there are eight logistical soldiers in the rear providing equipment, food, and other supplies. Therefore, out of the over 500,000 U.S. aggressors, only 60,000 to 70,000 can actually participate in combat. The *Christian Science Monitor* lamented that due to the enormous consumption of the Vietnam War, the U.S. "has very few active-duty army or Marine Corps troops left for this war." The U.S. Army now has difficulty providing even one division for "emergencies outside Europe." Senator Nelson also admitted that no matter how many troops the U.S. commits to the Vietnam War, it will not achieve military victory.

The More They Struggle, the More They Fail

Facing this situation, the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson is not giving up, scheming to launch more desperate struggles. He not only sent Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler to South Vietnam for an "inspection," vowing to "satisfy" the troop increase request of the U.S. commander in South Vietnam, Westmoreland, but also reorganized the U.S. battlefield command in northern South Vietnam, attempting to strengthen combat command. However, Johnson's desperate struggles will not save the U.S. from its defeat in the Vietnam War but will instead accelerate its complete failure.

Senator Church said that if the U.S. continues to expand the Asian battlefield and use American troops to fight Asians, American military and financial resources will be exhausted. This situation has made the *Chicago Sun-Times* and the *Wall Street Journal* lament: "More troops and stronger firepower will not achieve anything... but will only suffer more losses."

Agence France-Presse said: "The ghost of Dien Bien Phu is increasingly haunting the Americans." A naval reserve officer who served twice in South Vietnam said that the U.S. in Vietnam may face the same "embarrassing and humiliating" failure as the French colonialists.

### 南越军民打得纸老虎原形毕露　美国侵略者在南越战场上难逃灭顶之灾　美国和西方国家报刊供认美帝深陷泥潭狼狈万状

　　南越军民打得纸老虎原形毕露
　　美国侵略者在南越战场上难逃灭顶之灾
　　美国和西方国家报刊供认美帝深陷泥潭狼狈万状
    据新华社十四日讯　越南南方军民在强大的新春攻势中以人民战争的无比威力，打得美国侵略军丢盔弃甲，狼狈万状。南越战场上的五十多万美国侵略军，士气空前低落，悲观绝望情绪，象瘟疫一样在美国少爷兵中间广泛蔓延。陷在一些孤立据点里的美军，有如瓮中之鳖，龟缩在工事里，被动挨打。对此，美国和西方其它国家资产阶级报刊和通讯社也无法掩饰，它们最近连续对美国侵略者在南越战场上的狼狈处境发出的哀叹，恰恰败露了美帝国主义纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    士无斗志　草木皆兵
    美帝国主义远涉重洋，派遣大量军队到越南南方进行不义的侵略战争，这就必然地决定了这场战争的不得人心和士无斗志。而在越南南方军民最近的强大新春攻势打击下，美国侵略军士气低落，军心厌战的情况，更是发展到空前严重的程度。英国《太阳报》记者自西贡发出的报道承认，美国军队“陷于紧张和战战兢兢之中”。他写道：美国军人“脸上都带着苍白和疲倦的样子，总是穿着防弹的飞行衣睡觉。”“一个空军上校说：‘它（指南越军民的新春攻势）使人的神经一直处于紧张状态，所以最小的一点事就会使你感到不安。’”
    随美国海军陆战队在顺化进行战地采访的一个英国摄影记者报道说，他看到美国军队都“人人自危，担心第二枪就可能轮到自己头上”。这个记者哀叹，“海军陆战队的士气看来是非常、非常的低沉。”“每个人的神经都非常紧张”，他们“祷告上帝保佑，让他能够挨到活着撤退”。
    身陷重围　束手无策
    越南南方军民在新春攻势中，歼灭和瓦解了美、伪大量有生力量，进一步解放了南方的广大农村地区，使美、伪军不得不龟缩到一些城市和孤立据点里，而越来越多的据点又已落入南方军民的重围之中。另一方面，在南方军民频繁而广泛的攻势下，美帝又不得不调派大量的军队去各地“应急”，这就使它已有的战线太广和兵力不足之间的尖锐矛盾，变得更加尖锐起来，使它的这个战略弱点更加突出。
    法新社说，在南越北部，“大多数公路都是共产党（指人民解放武装力量）控制的，无法通行。在去年底还被认为是安全的公路，现在已变成非常可怕的了”。西德《法兰克福汇报》说，广大农村地区是“属于越共（指人民解放武装力量）的”。“犹灵、昆天、溪山基地悬在空中，它们的供应基地东河象一个孤岛漂浮在红色海洋中。”
    美国在南越战场虽然有五十多万侵略军队，但是，这些“少爷兵”不但作战无力，而且要有庞大的人员为他们维持后勤供应。据西方报刊统计，一个美国兵在前线作战，在后方就要有八名后勤士兵为他提供装备、饮食等种种给养。因此，在五十多万美国侵略军中，实际能够参加战斗的只有六万到七万人。美国《基督教科学箴言报》哀叹，由于侵越战争的巨大消耗，美国“可以用于这场战争的现役陆军或海军陆战队已经很少了”。美国陆军现在要为“欧洲以外地区的紧急事件提供一个师都有困难”。参议员纳尔逊也承认，美国不论在侵越战争中投入多少军队，都不可能取得军事胜利。
    越是挣扎　失败越惨
    面对着这种形势，美帝国主义头子约翰逊贼心不死，处心积虑地策划进行更疯狂的垂死挣扎。他不但派遣参谋长联席会议主席惠勒在南越现场“视察”，扬言要“满足”侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰的增兵要求，而且还改组美国在南越北部的战地司令部，企图加强作战指挥。可是，约翰逊的疯狂挣扎，绝对挽救不了美帝侵越战争的败局，相反，必将加速它的彻底失败。
    美国参议员丘奇说，如果美国继续在越来越扩大的亚洲战场上用美国兵同亚洲人打仗，美国的兵力和财力就将枯竭。这种情况使《芝加哥太阳时报》和《华尔街日报》不得不哀叹说：“军队再多些，火力再强些，都不能赢得什么东西……只会遭到更多的损失。”
    法新社说：“法国在奠边府的幽灵越来越困扰着美国人”。一个曾两度在南越服役的海军预备役军官说，美国在越南可能面临和法国殖民主义者一样的“尴尬和丢脸的”失败。
