The Mu Chengjian Coal Mine, under the Beijing Mining Bureau (formerly the Jingxi Mining Bureau), has conducted sustained revolutionary criticism at the brigade level, combining various tasks and achieving excellent results. Currently, the revolutionary workers of this coal mine have universally joined the ranks of revolutionary criticism. Through criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in this unit, the workers' consciousness of class struggle and line struggle has significantly improved, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking and vigorously advancing production and work.

Chairman Mao said: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front is to launch a criticism of revisionism." The revolutionary workers of the Mu Chengjian Coal Mine have firmly remembered this teaching from Chairman Mao. After achieving revolutionary unity, they further launched revolutionary criticism activities. Previously, the main form of revolutionary criticism in this coal mine was holding large meetings. After achieving revolutionary unity, how to further mobilize the masses, organize everyone to join the ranks of revolutionary criticism, and conduct revolutionary criticism even better? The People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine brought this question to the masses for investigation, learned from the masses, and sought their opinions. They learned from the workers that they were not satisfied with just holding large criticism meetings. The workers believed that large criticism meetings only allowed a few people to speak at the meeting and could not allow everyone to speak and criticize. The workers proposed holding criticism meetings at the brigade level, which could allow everyone to participate in the revolutionary criticism battle. A workshop took the lead in holding a brigade criticism meeting, further arousing the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm, and the effect was very good. This method was quickly promoted throughout the mine. Brigade criticism meetings are all held during leisure time. The number of people in a brigade is small, and there is no restriction on the meeting venue; workshops and dormitories can all hold meetings. The mine's brigade criticism activities have been continuously carried out for more than five months. According to statistics from the past two months alone, the entire mine held more than 200 brigade criticism meetings.

Revolutionary workers combine the study and application of Chairman Mao's works with criticism in the revolutionary criticism. Each brigade in this coal mine has an arrangement for revolutionary criticism, criticizing only one counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy each time. Before the criticism, they first study relevant quotations from Chairman Mao. For example, when criticizing the revisionist "material incentives," they first study Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work"; when criticizing the revisionist cadre line, they first study the five conditions proposed by Chairman Mao for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. During the study, they link it to the actual situation of the mine and have a full discussion. Then, they hold a criticism meeting. At the meeting, revolutionary workers use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the mine. After the meeting, they check how well Mao Zedong Thought has been studied and applied, and how well China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line has been criticized. If it is not used well or criticized thoroughly, they continue learning and criticizing in the next session. In this way, the more they study Chairman Mao's works, the higher their awareness of criticizing revisionism; the more they criticize revisionism, the greater their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works.

The revolutionary workers of the Mu Chengjian Coal Mine particularly emphasize studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and quickly implementing them in action. Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." When this latest instruction from Chairman Mao reached the mine, each brigade, department, and residential area immediately took action, adopting the method of learning and comparing while criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party line with Chairman Mao's proletarian party line. Through studying Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party line, the broad masses of party members and revolutionary workers quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in action, launching the work of rectifying party organizations and strengthening party building.

The mine also closely combines brigade criticism meetings with class education on recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness. The old workers of Mu Chengjian all have a history of blood and tears in the old society and have deep hatred for the old society. At the brigade criticism meetings, they recall and compare, bitterly recounting the sufferings of the old society and sweetly discussing the new society, carrying class hatred to the battlefield, and fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism. They said, China's Khrushchev opposes Mao Zedong Thought and wants to restore capitalism in China, which is absolutely unacceptable. He is our working class's sworn enemy, and we will not be able to eat, sleep, or rest until we criticize him to the end. The brigade criticism meetings have become a large classroom for class education. Their practice of combining revolutionary criticism with class education is: some first hold a recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness meeting, followed by a criticism meeting; some use the facts of comparing the new and old societies in the criticism meeting to expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, who attempt to restore capitalism. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary workers have an even deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and an even greater hatred for China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line he promotes.

The Mu Chengjian Coal Mine also combines brigade criticism meetings with various current tasks. For example, when preparing to implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination, revolutionary workers focus on criticizing China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" on the cadre issue. When simplifying the organization, they criticize the revisionist management system. Each time they combine criticism with various tasks, they seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant quotations, raising the workers' ideological awareness, making the workers fully understand the political significance of various tasks, and promoting production and work. Combining brigade criticism meetings with various tasks makes the content of brigade criticism meetings more rich and lively, and can be sustained for a long time.

    木城涧煤矿把活学活用毛主席著作和革命大批判紧密结合起来
    学习伟大领袖毛主席一段语录
    批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论
    革命职工阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟显著提高，革命和生产形势越来越好
    据新华社讯　北京矿务局（原京西矿务局）木城涧煤矿，以班组为单位，结合各项任务，持久地开展革命的大批判，收到了很好的效果。现在，这个煤矿的革命职工，普遍地投入了革命大批判的战斗行列。通过对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本单位代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线的批判，革命职工阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟显著提高，促进了人的思想革命化，有力地推动了生产和工作。
    毛主席说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”木城涧煤矿的革命职工，牢记毛主席这一教导，在实现革命大联合以后，进一步开展了革命大批判活动。这个煤矿以前开展革命大批判的主要形式是开大会。在实现革命大联合以后，如何进一步发动群众，把每一个人都组织到革命大批判的战斗行列中来，把革命大批判搞得更好？驻矿人民解放军带着这个问题到群众中作调查，向群众学习，征求意见。他们在群众中知道了工人们不满足于只搞大会批判。工人们认为，大会批判只有少数人有机会在会上发言，不能人人都发言，都批判。工人们提出以班组为单位开展革命大批判，可以使人人都参加革命大批判的战斗。有一个车间首先开了班组批判会，进一步调动了工人的革命积极性，效果很好。这个办法，很快在全矿推广开来。班组批判会都在业余时间进行。班组里人数不多，不受开会场地的限制，车间宿舍都可以开会。这个矿的班组批判活动，已经连续开展了五个多月。仅据近两个月的统计，全矿就开了二百多次班组批判会。
    革命职工在革命大批判中，把活学活用毛主席著作和大批判结合起来。这个煤矿的各个班组对革命大批判都有一个安排，每次只批判一个反革命修正主义谬论。在批判前，先学习毛主席的有关语录。例如，在批判修正主义的“物质刺激”时，先学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导；在批判修正主义的干部路线时，先学习毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件。学习时，联系本矿实际情况，充分讨论。然后，再开批判会。会上，革命职工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本矿代理人的反革命修正主义罪行。会后还要检查毛泽东思想学习和运用得怎样，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批判得怎样。如果用得不够好，批得不够透，下一次再接着学，接着批。这样，越学习毛主席著作，批判修正主义的自觉性越高；越批判修正主义，学习毛主席著作的劲头越大。
    木城涧煤矿革命职工在革命大批判中，特别重视学习和运用毛主席的最新指示，并迅速落实到行动上。毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”毛主席的这一最新指示传到矿上，各班组、科室和家属区，立即行动起来，采取了边学习、边对照的方法，用毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。广大党员和革命职工通过学习毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，迅速把毛主席的最新指示落实到行动上，开展了整顿党的组织，加强党的建设的工作。
    这个矿还把班组批判会和忆苦思甜的阶级教育紧密结合起来。木城涧的老工人在旧社会都有一部血泪史，对旧社会有着深仇大恨。在班组批判会上，他们回忆对比，大诉旧社会的苦，大谈新社会的甜，怀着阶级仇恨上战场，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想，要在中国复辟资本主义，这是绝对不能容忍的。他是我们工人阶级不共戴天的敌人，不把他批倒批臭，我们就吃不下饭，睡不好觉，放不下心。班组批判会变成了阶级教育的大课堂。他们在革命大批判中紧密结合阶级教育的做法是：有的先开忆苦思甜会，接着开批判会；有的在批判会上，用新旧社会对比的事实，揭发和批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。通过革命大批判，广大革命职工对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的反革命修正主义路线更加仇恨。
    木城涧煤矿还把班组批判会和当前各项任务结合起来。如在准备实行革命三结合的时候，革命职工集中地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。在精简机构的时候，就批判修正主义的管理制度。在每次结合各项任务进行批判时，都要认真学习毛主席最新指示和有关语录，提高了职工的思想觉悟，使职工们充分认识到各项任务的政治意义，推动了生产和工作。班组批判会和各项任务结合起来进行，使班组批判会的内容更加丰富生动，并且能够持久地开展下去。
