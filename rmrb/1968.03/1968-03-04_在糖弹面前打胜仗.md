After the proletarian revolutionary factions took power, should we strictly adhere to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "save money for the revolution" and "build the country through thrift," and manage the financial power seriously? Or should we indulge in extravagance and waste state property at will? This is a serious political struggle and an important manifestation of the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the current phase of the Cultural Revolution, as we strive for comprehensive victory.

The bourgeoisie is most likely to attack us through our daily lives and economic matters. Chairman Mao warned us in 1949, on the eve of national liberation, "There may be some communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns; they are indeed heroes in front of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of bullets wrapped in sugar coating. They will be defeated in front of sugar bullets." After national liberation, some comrades in the revolutionary ranks did not heed Chairman Mao's warning. Shortly after entering the cities, they were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and became captives of the bourgeoisie. The past serves as a lesson for the future. Today, comrades who have been seriously corrupted by bourgeois ideology and are already indulging in extravagance and waste in managing financial expenditures and personal life should be awakened with a warning bell.

The proletarian dictatorship must have a strong economy as its foundation. If financial power is not firmly grasped, political power cannot be firmly grasped either. Some comrades, after taking power, treat financial expenditures as trivial matters, approving expenditures recklessly, or handing over financial power to politically unreliable individuals. This must be corrected immediately.

This year is the year we will achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. Saving on financial expenditures and managing financial power well is an important aspect of achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We must fully mobilize the masses to fight against extravagance, waste, embezzlement, and theft, to fight against the use of power to turn state financial power into the financial power of small groups, and to fight against all acts of sabotage by class enemies. We, the proletarian revolutionary factions, must always maintain our revolutionary spirit and carry the revolution through to the end!

    在糖弹面前打胜仗
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，是遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”和“勤俭建国”的伟大号召，认真地去掌好财权，还是讲排场、摆阔气，随意浪费国家财物？这是一场严肃的政治斗争，是当前文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的情况下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的一个重要表现形式。
    资产阶级思想是最容易从生活上、经济上打破缺口，向我们进攻的。毛主席在一九四九年全国解放前夕曾经告诫我们：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”全国解放后，革命队伍中有些人没有牢记毛主席这一教导，进城市不久，就被资产阶级糖衣炮弹所击中，成了资产阶级的俘虏。前车之覆，后车之鉴。今天已经受到资产阶级思想严重腐蚀，在掌握财政开支上，在个人的生活上已经铺张浪费起来的同志，我们应该向他们敲一敲警钟，使他们警醒过来。
    无产阶级政权，必须要有强有力的经济作为它的基础。财权掌不牢，政权也不能掌牢。有些同志掌了权后，把财政开支问题当作不屑一顾的小事，大手大脚地乱批开支，或者把财政大权随意交给政治上不可靠的人去掌管，必须从速纠正过来。
    今年是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年。节约财政开支，掌好财权，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要的方面。我们必须充分发动群众，与铺张浪费、贪污盗窃的现象作斗争，与利用职权，把国家的财权当作小团体的财权的现象作斗争，与阶级敌人的一切破坏财政的现象作斗争。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要永葆革命的青春，将革命进行到底！
