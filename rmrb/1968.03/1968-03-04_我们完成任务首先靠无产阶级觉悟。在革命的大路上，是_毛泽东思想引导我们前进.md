The traitor and scoundrel Khrushchev of China says: "Now it is good to study culture and technology and not politics, because the main task now is to study culture and technology, and politics will be studied later." The traitor and counter-revolutionary plotter Luo Ruiqing, in collusion with his master, whipped up a frenzy of "competitive exercises." Their evil intentions are to make us focus only on technology and not on politics, to not care about national affairs, and to attempt to alter the nature of the people's army, preparing for their plot to seize the Party and the state.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Indeed, it is not technology that "determines everything," but people armed with Mao Zedong Thought who determine everything.

A few years ago, our driver team had a problem: unsafe driving. How to ensure safety? At that time, Luo Ruiqing was promoting the bourgeois "technology first" frenzy. Some comrades focused solely on technology. To practice technology, they squeezed out time for studying Chairman Mao's works and political classes. As a result, vehicle accidents not only did not decrease but actually increased. This setback taught us a lesson, making us deeply understand: Political work is the lifeline of all work. Without emphasizing proletarian politics, without studying Chairman Mao's works, and without using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our actions, our work will definitely go astray.

We recognized the error of "technology first" and corrected our course, advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. We thoroughly criticized the set of "regulations" and "measures" that emphasized technology and established a new set of regulations and measures that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We insist on studying the "Three Articles" every day and learn Chairman Mao's quotations at all times, in all places, and in all matters. We do not drive without studying Chairman Mao's quotations, ensuring that before the vehicle moves, ideological work is already in progress. Old drivers guide new drivers, not by first introducing the vehicle and technical conditions, but by leading the new comrades to study the "Three Articles" and the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, ensuring that guiding people starts with guiding their thoughts. When accidents occur or signs of accidents appear, we first do not check for technical reasons but sit down to study Chairman Mao's teachings, analyze the ideological situation, and summarize experiences and lessons. Through practice, comrades have summed up four sentences: "Nine out of ten accidents are due to speed, political accidents come from collisions, to ensure safe driving, Mao Zedong Thought must be the commander."

With the correct direction, the spirit of the entire team has been renewed, and various tasks have been well accomplished. The bitter experience of emphasizing technology and the sweet experience of emphasizing politics are in stark contrast, making us deeply realize: We accomplish our mission first not by relying on technology, but by relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a high level of proletarian consciousness. Without Mao Zedong Thought, people become slaves to machines. We revolutionary soldiers must thoroughly criticize the traitor and counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing's fallacy of "technology first," always emphasize politics, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide us forward.

    我们完成任务首先靠无产阶级觉悟。在革命的大路上，是
    毛泽东思想引导我们前进
    某部司机班
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“现在要求学习文化和技术、不愿学政治，这很好，因为目前主要是学习文化、学技术，将来学政治。”篡军反党分子罗瑞卿，配合他的主子，刮起“大比武”的妖风。他们的恶毒用心就是要我们只管技术，不问政治，不关心国家大事，妄图篡改人民军队的性质，为他们篡党篡国做准备。
    伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。事实正是这样，不是技术“决定一切”，而是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人决定一切。
    几年前，我们司机班存在的一个问题就是行车不安全。如何保证安全呢？当时，正是罗瑞卿刮起资产阶级“技术第一”的妖风的时候，有的同志就一股劲地抓技术。为了练技术，挤掉了毛主席著作学习和上政治课的时间。结果，车辆事故不但没有减少，反而越来越多。挫折教训了我们，使我们深深懂得：政治工作是一切工作的生命线。不突出无产阶级政治，不抓毛主席著作学习，不用毛泽东思想指导行动，工作就一定要走到邪路上去。
    我们认识到“技术第一”的错误，扭转了方向，沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线前进。我们大破突出技术的一套“规定”和“措施”，重新立了一套闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新规定、新措施。天天坚持学习“老三篇”，时时、处处、事事学毛主席语录。不学毛主席语录就不出车，做到车辆未动，思想工作先行。老司机带新司机，不是首先介绍车辆和技术情况，而是领着新同志学习“老三篇”，学习“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，做到带人先带思想。发生事故或出现了事故苗头，首先不是检查技术原因，而是坐下来学习毛主席的教导，分析思想情况，总结经验教训。通过实践，同志们概括出来四句话：“十次事故九次快，冲击政治事故来，要想行车保安全，毛泽东思想为统帅。”
    方向对头了，全班同志的精神面貌就焕然一新，较好地完成了各项任务。突出技术的苦头和突出政治的甜头鲜明对比，使我们深深认识到：我们完成任务首先不是靠技术，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠高度的无产阶级觉悟。离开了毛泽东思想，人就成了机器的奴隶。我们革命战士一定要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿所谓“技术第一”的谬论，永远突出政治，用毛泽东思想指挥我们前进。
