In the Vietnam South, women with great aspirations for resisting America and saving the nation have actively fought on the battlefield. They have achieved glorious victories in the Tet Offensive. The Vietnam South Women's Liberation Union calls on women in the South to bravely advance and achieve a complete victory in the struggle to resist America and save the nation.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 8th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: In the Vietnam South's Tet Offensive, which shook the world, the heroic women of Vietnam South have achieved glorious victories for their country. They fought side by side with the broad masses of soldiers and civilians, fiercely striking back at the American aggressors and their lackeys, and winning new victories.

During the Tet Offensive, in more than a hundred cities and towns such as Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang, women warriors could be seen fighting bravely in the battle trenches on many streets. Many female workers and other laboring women, as well as female students, enthusiastically participated in rescuing wounded soldiers, delivering ammunition, supplies, and communications. Many women joined the self-defense teams and bravely fought the enemy.

In Saigon, many female students volunteered to join the labor force, continuously moving from one district to another over several days to deliver food, water, and ammunition to the liberation army. In many places in the Saigon-Cholon district, revolutionary organizations issued orders, and immediately large numbers of women responded, demanding to be assigned various tasks needed for the revolution.

In the revolutionary storm, women displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism, fighting tenaciously, and setting brilliant examples. In the armed struggle to seize power in Delat County, Quang Nam Province, a woman named Ahong bravely led the armed parade to the front, charging into the county seat. Although she was wounded, she still held high the red flag and shouted slogans, urging everyone to bravely advance and seize power for the people. Ahong's heroic spirit greatly inspired the military and civilians of the county to fight.

On February 2nd, women in Binh Dinh Province bravely and intelligently captured the Ke Mountain outpost, forcing the enemy to surrender and seizing all their weapons and ammunition.

In Hue City, ten female members of a self-defense team repelled a company of American invaders with submachine guns and grenades, killing more than 120 enemy soldiers in a battle within the city.

In a battle in Hue City, the people's liberation armed forces attacked a U.S. military barracks. An elderly woman, fearless of sacrifice, led the liberation army to capture alive an American colonel "advisor" who was hiding.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 8th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: The Vietnam South Women's Liberation Union issued a call on the occasion of International Women's Day, urging women in Vietnam South to bravely advance and achieve a complete victory in the struggle to resist America and save the nation.

The call urges women in cities and towns to enthusiastically join the struggle, bravely and continuously attack the enemy, annihilate the American puppet forces, and smash various institutions of the puppet army and puppet government.

The call urges women in the liberated areas to enthusiastically join the militia and guerrilla forces, actively build combat villages and combat districts, and be ready to go to the front line at any time; at the same time, actively participate in support work, take good care of the wounded, and do a good job in production to support all patriotic forces in the battle.
