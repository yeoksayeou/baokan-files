The broad masses of revolutionary people in Zhejiang Province, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, have adopted various forms to thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, thus powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 29 — The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Zhejiang Province, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have, in combination with the actual struggle at present, adopted various forms to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang, and have hoisted the great red flag of Mao Zedong's thought over all positions in the province.

In the rural areas, factories, offices, schools, and other places in Zhejiang Province, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have, in the course of thoroughly carrying out the great criticism, generally combined it with the current work and production tasks, conducted themed criticism, emphasized key points, had clear objectives, and concentrated firepower.

In the rural areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other places, the broad masses have, in combination with the current extensive campaign to learn from Dazhai and spring plowing production, thoroughly exposed and criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang for opposing the learning from Dazhai, promoting the policy of linking work points to remuneration and material incentives, and attempting to restore capitalism. At various criticism meetings, many poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is Chairman Mao's great call. Following the Dazhai road is following the socialist road pointed out by Chairman Mao. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang oppose learning from Dazhai, attempting to make us take the capitalist road and suffer twice, which we firmly oppose. The Hongwei Brigade of Gangkou Commune in Changxing County, through revolutionary criticism, has greatly promoted the extensive movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thought among the masses, and powerfully promoted the current spring plowing production. In mid-March, at the provincial conference on learning from Dazhai held in Xinxing Brigade of Shendang Commune in Haiyan County, representatives from all over the province gathered to criticize China's Khrushchev for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and attempting to restore capitalism. Through thorough revolutionary criticism, the entire province's rural areas have extensively promoted the experience of Dazhai in emphasizing politics in work-point assessment, further launching a wave of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture."

In the industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial sectors, as well as in offices, schools, and neighborhoods, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have, in combination with the current struggle and work and production, thoroughly carried out revolutionary criticism. More than 200 machinery factories and handicraft factories in the province have recently held various meetings to support agricultural spring plowing production, criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang for promoting material incentives and profit-seeking, and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Through the great criticism, the broad revolutionary workers have established the idea of serving agriculture, actively going to the countryside and to the doors of farmers to repair spring plowing tools. Primary and secondary schools throughout the province have also, in combination with the current struggle-criticism-transformation, used Chairman Mao's March 7 instructions and a series of latest instructions as weapons to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

In the urban and rural areas of Zhejiang Province, generally, flexible and varied, small and lively forms have been adopted in thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the rural areas, fields, water conservancy sites; in the fishing areas, boats, and nets; in factories, workshops; in stores, counters; in schools, classes; in neighborhoods, alleys, small criticism meetings have been held everywhere, attracting more people to join the ranks of revolutionary criticism, making China's Khrushchev a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat him. Especially in many poor and lower-middle peasant and old worker households, Mao Zedong's works have been widely read and used, and the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism have been carried out, powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

The broad revolutionary masses in Zhejiang Province, by closely combining the current struggle with the study and criticism, adopting flexible and varied forms, have therefore made revolutionary criticism a regular practice in many places. Now, many places are summarizing experiences and are determined to continue the effort, carrying out revolutionary criticism persistently, and letting the invincible thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions.

    让伟大毛泽东思想占领一切阵地
    结合实际深入地开展革命大批判
    浙江省广大革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，采用多种形式，狠揭狠批以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反革命罪行，有力地促进了人的思想革命化
    新华社杭州二十九日电　浙江省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，结合当前斗争实际，采取多种形式，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江代理人的反革命修正主义罪行，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全省各个阵地。
    浙江省广大农村、工厂、机关、学校在深入开展革命大批判中，一般都结合当前各项工作和生产任务，进行专题批判，重点突出，目的明确，火力集中。
    杭州、嘉兴、金华、绍兴、宁波等地区广大农村，普遍结合当前广泛开展的学大寨运动和春耕生产等工作，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江代理人反对学大寨，推行工分挂帅、物质刺激等妄图复辟资本主义的反革命罪行。在各种批判会上，许多贫下中农说：“农业学大寨”是毛主席的伟大号召，走大寨道路，就是走毛主席指引的社会主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人反对学大寨，就是要我们走资本主义道路，要我们吃二遍苦，我们坚决不答应。长兴县港口公社红卫大队通过革命大批判，大大推动了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的深入开展，有力地推动了当前春耕生产。三月中旬，在海盐县沈荡公社新星大队召开的全省学大寨现场会上，来自全省各地的代表，又集中批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。通过深入的革命大批判，全省农村普遍推广了大寨突出政治的评工记分经验，进一步掀起“农业学大寨”的热潮。
    在工业、交通、财贸战线和机关、学校、街道，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众也结合当前斗争实际和工作、生产，深入开展革命大批判。全省两百多个机械工厂和手工业工厂，最近普遍在召开支援农业春耕生产的各种会议上，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江代理人推行的物质刺激、利润挂帅等反革命修正主义黑货。广大革命职工通过大批判，树立了为农业服务的思想，积极下乡上门修理春耕农具。全省大、中、小学也普遍结合当前斗批改，以毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示为武器，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。
    浙江省广大城乡在深入开展革命大批判中，一般都采用灵活多样、小型活泼的形式，农村的田头、水利工地；渔区的船头、网棚；工厂的班组；商店的店堂；学校的班级；街道的里弄，都纷纷举行小型批判会，使更多的群众参加到革命大批判的行列，使中国赫鲁晓夫成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。特别是许多贫下中农和老工人的家庭，也成为大学大用毛主席著作、开展斗私批修的阵地，有力地促进人的思想革命化。
    浙江省广大革命群众，由于密切结合当前斗争实际，把大学习和大批判紧密结合起来，采用灵活多样的形式，因此，许多地区的革命大批判已做到经常化，大学习带动了大批判，大批判又推动了大学习。现在，许多地区正在总结经验，决心再接再厉，把革命大批判持久地开展下去，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
