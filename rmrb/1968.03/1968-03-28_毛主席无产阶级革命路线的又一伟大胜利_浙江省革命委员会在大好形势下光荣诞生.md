The birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province has been born in a great situation nationwide. On March 24, thirty thousand military personnel and civilians gathered in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, to celebrate this great event. The city was filled with a sea of red flags, and the people shouted slogans in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The people of Zhejiang Province, both military and civilian, must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." They must strengthen proletarian dictatorship, strengthen military-civilian unity and combat friendship, heighten revolutionary vigilance, strengthen preparedness, further investigate the counter-revolutionary crimes of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, guard against the reactionary activities of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, resolutely smash the plots of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang bandits, and all class enemies, and be ready at any time to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 27

Under the personal care and wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the heroic three million one hundred thousand military and civilian people of Zhejiang Province have, after more than a year of heroic struggle, won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province has been born in a great situation nationwide.

The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is another triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always been deeply concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province and has given a series of extremely important instructions. At critical moments in the struggle, Chairman Mao personally inspected Zhejiang. Chairman Mao's personal care and great teachings have given the revolutionary masses, the broad revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Zhejiang Province immense encouragement and boundless strength. The revolutionary people of Zhejiang, who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, have followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, displayed the fearless spirit of the proletarian revolution, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Zhejiang, and routed them completely, causing them to collapse entirely and seize back the power they had usurped, thus winning a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On March 24, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, was filled with a sea of red flags. Thirty thousand revolutionary masses and soldiers from all fronts in the province, carrying the giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surged from all directions to the Youth Palace Square by West Lake to celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province.

The celebration meeting began to the majestic tune of "The East is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the formal establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and the firing of salute cannons. The people shouted in unison: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live our red sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Zhejiang is located in a key coastal defense area in the east. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, extended their black hands into Zhejiang, planted their claws, and carried out counter-revolutionary criminal activities. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Zhejiang Province has always been extremely sharp and intense. The birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province declares the bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang, and the complete failure of their evil plot to restore capitalism in Zhejiang. After more than a year of baptism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian dictatorship in the eastern front of the motherland has been greatly strengthened and consolidated, which is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and all class enemies at home and abroad.

On the day of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province, from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border to the Zhoushan Islands, from the Yandang Mountains to the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain, red flags were flying everywhere, and the atmosphere was joyous. The three million one hundred thousand heroic sons and daughters of the entire province expressed their common wish from the bottom of their hearts: Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

"Military-civilian unity is like one person; see who can defeat us?" The broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, who have made immortal contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work, participated in the celebration meeting today with immense excitement and were warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. At the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad soldiers and officers of the Zhejiang garrison responded resolutely to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and stood up to support the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses. In more than a year of joint struggle, they have forged a deep combat friendship with the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres throughout the province and have built an iron wall on the eastern front of the motherland.

The commander of the Nanjing Military Region, Comrade Xu Shiyou, and comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province and representatives of the revolutionary masses attended the meeting. Comrade Xu Shiyou gave a speech.

Comrade Nan Ping, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province, spoke at the celebration meeting, reviewing the glorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province over the past year. He said, all our victories have been achieved under the direct command of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the proletarian revolutionary line headed by Chairman Mao. They are all great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Nan Ping said, after the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, redouble our efforts, strive for the forefront, and continue to advance. We must strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. He said, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the tasks at hand are: to fully implement Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to vigorously carry out various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Strengthen the education of the struggle between the two lines and adhere to the struggle between the two lines. We must deepen the revolutionary criticism, using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a weapon, mobilize the masses, and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Zhejiang. We must strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and continue to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle," strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities of class enemies. Zhejiang is located in a key coastal defense area. All revolutionary masses must strengthen their awareness of the enemy, heighten revolutionary vigilance, strengthen preparedness, further investigate the counter-revolutionary crimes of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, guard against the reactionary activities of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, smash the plots of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang bandits, and all class enemies, and be ready at any time to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great instruction to "support the army and love the people," strengthen the revolutionary unity between the military and the people. We must further implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," highlight proletarian politics, economize for revolution, and achieve victory in both revolution and production.

Comrade Nan Ping said, we will not betray Chairman Mao's trust in us, nor will we betray the trust of the revolutionary masses throughout the province. We will definitely follow the example of Comrade Lin Biao, always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We will defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with our blood and lives. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses for a moment." We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's wise instructions in the comments on the "Seven Materials on Cadres Participating in Labor in Zhejiang Province," forever maintain the character of laborers, forever be servants of the people, and forever be thorough proletarian revolutionaries. We will, together with the three million one hundred thousand military and civilian people of the entire province, strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every position in Zhejiang!

Comrade Xiong Yingtan, the acting commander of the Zhejiang Military Region and vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, spoke on behalf of the soldiers and officers of the three armies stationed in Zhejiang. He said, over the past year, we, the three armies stationed in Zhejiang, and the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres throughout the province have, in the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, shared weal and woe and forged a blood-bonded, fish-water-like combat friendship. We will definitely, together with the people of the entire province, further strengthen the revolutionary unity between the military and the people, heighten vigilance, guard the coastal defense, be ready at any time to smash the provocations of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, annihilate all enemies that dare to invade, defend our great motherland, and defend the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Xiong Yingtan said, all the soldiers and officers of the three armies stationed in Zhejiang will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, take Comrade Li Wenzhong, the heroic Fourth Platoon, and the Eighth Company of the Eighth Division as shining examples, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and seriously implement the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting factions." We will further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work. We will never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget highlighting proletarian politics, never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the great waves of class struggle, raise the construction of the revolutionization and modernization of the army to a higher level. We will defend the proletarian revolutionary headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, defend the proletarian revolutionary power, defend proletarian dictatorship, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Comrade Lai Keke, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from the preparatory committees of the Zhejiang Provincial Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, and Red Guards Congress, and the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters and the Temporary Command of the Red Rebels in Zhejiang Province spoke at the celebration meeting with great revolutionary enthusiasm. They unanimously expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of the province, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, further carry out the "support the army and love the people" activities, continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "economize for revolution," and determine to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    浙江地处东南沿海国防要地。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，把黑手伸进浙江，安插爪牙，进行反革命罪恶活动。浙江省两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直非常尖锐激烈。浙江省革命委员会的诞生，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线破产，宣告了他们妄图在浙江复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底失败。经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，祖国东海前哨的无产阶级专政，得到了极大的巩固和加强，这对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、蒋介石匪帮和国内外一切阶级敌人是一个沉重的打击。
