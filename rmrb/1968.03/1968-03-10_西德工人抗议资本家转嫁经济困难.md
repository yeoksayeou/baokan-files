Over a thousand workers and students in Cologne, West Germany, held a mass meeting on the evening of March 5 to strongly protest against capitalists shifting economic difficulties onto workers, not paying wages, and forcing them to "take time off." At the Ford Motor Company's plant in Cologne, which is American-owned, 9,800 workers were forced to implement this "time off" from February 22 to March 8. The workers are extremely dissatisfied with the capitalists' practice of shifting difficulties onto workers. With the support of students, they held a mass protest meeting at Cologne University. This mass meeting caused great alarm among the Cologne municipal authorities, who dispatched so-called "political police" to monitor the scene. However, as soon as these police entered the venue, the crowd jeered at them, expressing strong protest.

    西德工人抗议资本家转嫁经济困难
    西德科隆市一千多名工人和学生五日晚联合举行群众大会，强烈抗议资本家转嫁经济困难，对工人不发工资，强制他们“歇班”。在科隆的美资福特汽车厂，有九千八百名工人自二月二十二日到三月八日被迫实行这种“歇班”。工人们对资本家向工人转嫁困难的做法强烈不满，他们在学生的支持下，在科隆大学联合举行了群众抗议大会。这次群众大会使科隆市当局十分惊慌，他们派出所谓“政治警察”到会场进行监视。但是，当这些警察一进入会场，群众就向他们发出嘘声，表示强烈抗议。
