Following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, who said, "Only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself," we have invited cadres who have made mistakes to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We let them struggle against their private desires and criticize revisionism together with the masses, helping them recognize and correct their mistakes and thoroughly reform their worldview. This is a major measure to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The March 7th directive of our great leader Chairman Mao is the guiding light for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, the directive is being fully republished, which is the greatest concern, encouragement, and motivation from the great leader Chairman Mao for the "three supports, two militaries" personnel and the revolutionary masses and cadres across the country.

Chairman Mao teaches in the March 7th directive: "We must also persuade the students to follow Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform." This teaching from the great leader Chairman Mao has shown us the correct policy for handling cadres who have made mistakes. It has not only strongly promoted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary and secondary schools nationwide but also guided the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various industries across the country to victory.

Last October, when we helped the revolutionary masses of the Beijing Dyeing and Printing Factory establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we suggested inviting the former Party Committee Secretary, Wang Tongjiu, to participate. After the news spread, some revolutionary masses said, "Why let him participate in the study class? Isn't this to protect him?" Some even said, "I won't participate if he is there."

Wang Tongjiu made some mistakes before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and initially carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. However, looking at his entire history and work, his principles are good, and he is a revolutionary cadre. How should we handle such a cadre who has made mistakes? It seems that some comrades' understanding is still unclear. We then organized the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to study Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and related latest directives on correctly handling cadres. We also went to the workshops and production teams to propagate Chairman Mao's cadre policy, guiding the broad masses to understand the principle of "only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself" and helping them recognize that we should not exclude cadres who have made mistakes. The study class "should let these people participate to facilitate their reform." Finally, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory reached a consensus and agreed to let Comrade Wang Tongjiu participate in the study class.

Cadres who have made mistakes received great education in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary masses and "support-left" personnel from the People's Liberation Army studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and related works together with the cadres, struggling against their private desires and criticizing revisionism. In the study class, revolutionary masses had heart-to-heart talks with the cadres, providing patient help. Some revolutionary masses said earnestly, "We used to hate you for your mistakes. Many of you, to a certain extent, carried out the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and in your work, you did not follow the mass line but acted arbitrarily; at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, you did not follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment but suppressed the masses from rising up in revolution. Of course, we had to criticize and struggle against you. Now, as long as you listen to Chairman Mao's words and quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, you are still good comrades." Chairman Mao's teachings and the enthusiastic help from the revolutionary masses greatly raised the cadres' awareness. They actively exposed their private desires, dug out their roots, and seriously examined their mistakes. Wang Tongjiu said emotionally, "This time, it is Chairman Mao who saved me. I will be loyal to Chairman Mao for life, always root myself among the masses, and be a student of the masses for life."

At this time, some revolutionary mass organizations wrote big-character posters advocating the bold liberation and bold combination of Wang Tongjiu. Seeing that the masses had taken action, we further propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy and supported the masses in holding a "link-up meeting" to discuss how to view Wang Tongjiu. Revolutionary masses and cadres enthusiastically participated in the discussion. At the meeting, everyone expressed their opinions, calmly presenting facts and reasoning, and making a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of Comrade Wang Tongjiu. Wang Tongjiu himself also received a profound education from this. He made a comprehensive and profound examination of his mistakes, gaining the understanding of the masses. When the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Dyeing and Printing Factory was established, he was elected as the first-in-command.

From our practice, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's March 7th directive is a great guiding program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the future, we will, together with the broad revolutionary masses, further implement Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and a series of latest directives, achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　坚决执行毛主席的“三·七”指示正确对待干部
　　遵照毛主席提出的“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”，吸收犯错误的干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，让他们同群众一起斗私批修，帮助他们认识和纠正错误，彻底改造世界观。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重大措施。

    我们伟大导师毛主席的“三·七”指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。现在全文重新发表，是伟大领袖毛主席对“三支”“两军”人员和全国革命群众、革命干部的最大关怀、最大鼓舞和最大鞭策。
    毛主席在“三·七”指示中教导说：“还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，为我们指明了正确对待犯错误的干部的方针，不仅有力地促进了全国大、中、小学的无产阶级文化大革命，而且指导全国各行各业的无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进。
    去年十月，我们帮助北京印染厂的无产阶级革命派开办毛泽东思想学习班时，建议吸收原党委书记王通久参加。消息传出以后，有的革命群众说：“为什么要让他参加学习班，这不是要保他吗？”还有人干脆说：“和他一道学习，我不参加。”
    王通久同志在无产阶级文化大革命以前犯过一些错误，运动初期又执行过资产阶级反动路线。但是，从他的全部历史和全部工作来看，大节是好的，是一个革命干部。对于这样一个犯有错误的干部应该怎样对待？看来，有些同志的认识还是模糊的。我们便组织全厂革命群众学习毛主席的“三·七”指示和有关正确对待干部的一系列最新指示。我们还下到车间，深入到班组，向群众宣传毛主席的干部政策，引导广大群众认清“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的道理，帮助大家认识到不应当排斥犯错误的干部，学习班“要让这些人参加，以利改造”。全厂广大革命职工终于统一了认识，同意让王通久同志参加学习班学习。
    犯错误的革命干部在毛泽东思想学习班里，受到了很大的教育。革命群众、解放军支左人员，和干部们一起学习毛主席的最新指示和有关著作，一起斗私批修。在学习班里，革命群众同干部促膝谈心，进行耐心的帮助。有的革命群众语重心长地说：“我们以前恨你们，是恨你们的错误。你们当中不少人，过去在一定程度上执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，同时在工作中不走群众路线，独断专行；文化大革命初期又没有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，而是压制群众起来革命，我们当然要进行批判斗争。现在，你们只要听毛主席的话，迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来，那就还是好同志。”毛主席的教导，革命群众的热情帮助，大大提高了干部的觉悟。他们积极亮私心，挖私根，认真检查错误。王通久同志感动地说：“这次，是毛主席挽救了我，我要一辈子忠于毛主席，永远扎根于群众中，做一辈子群众的小学生。”
    就在这时候，有的革命群众组织写出了要大胆解放和大胆结合王通久的大字报。我们见群众起来了，就进一步宣传毛主席的干部政策，支持群众召开了讨论如何看待王通久的“串连会”。广大革命群众、革命干部踊跃参加了讨论。会上，各抒己见，心平气和地摆事实讲道理，对王通久同志作了全面的分析和估价。王通久同志本人也从中受到了一次深刻的教育。他对自己的错误作了全面、深刻的检查，取得了群众的谅解。北京印染厂革命委员会成立的时候，他被推选为第一把手。
    从我们的实践中，我们深深地体会到：毛主席的“三·七”指示，是一个伟大的指导无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。今后，我们要和广大无产阶级革命派一起，进一步落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
