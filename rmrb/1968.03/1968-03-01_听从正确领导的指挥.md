	Follow the Correct Leadership's Instructions
	First Rolling Mill Worker, Wáng Yìchéng

	Leadership that aligns with Mao Zedong Thought should be obeyed, words that align with Mao Zedong Thought should be heeded, and instructions that align with Mao Zedong Thought should be carried out resolutely. This is the true character of the proletariat. Some people, regardless of whether the leadership or the leadership's words are correct or not, refuse to listen, and if someone does listen, they label them as "slavish." In reality, this is a deviation towards anarchism.

	Our factory sends steel ingots to large-scale steel rolling mills. Some of the steel grades are incorrectly marked, and some are marked unclearly, which can lead to losses for state property. The foreman assigned me to check this. Should I go or not? Initially, I was uncertain. Because I saw that some people arbitrarily disobey the leadership's instructions and do not complete the tasks assigned by the leadership, and if someone follows the leadership, they are labeled as "slavish." I thought, if I follow the foreman's instructions, wouldn't I also be labeled as "slavish"? Thinking this way, my mind became confused.

	Studying Chairman Mao's great teaching of "thrift for revolution" helped me turn things around. Comparing it with Chairman Mao's words, I thought: if this task is not checked in time, it will result in good steel being used for inferior purposes. We, the proletariat, are the masters of the state. Can we just stand by and watch? At this moment, I used Mao Zedong Thought to evaluate those who supposedly do not engage in "slavish" behavior and realized they had been misled by anarchism. I thought, we should use Mao Zedong Thought to discern right from wrong. The foreman assigned me to check the steel ingots to prevent losses to state property, which completely aligns with Mao Zedong Thought. I should resolutely carry out this task!

	With my mind cleared and my resolve strengthened, I braved the biting cold wind and cheerfully went to the large-scale steel rolling mill. With one hand holding a hammer and the other a pair of pliers, I checked the steel grades and marked the steel ingots in the pile. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, I not only completed the inspection task assigned by the foreman but also raised my ideological awareness.

    听从正确领导的指挥
    第一初轧厂精整工人　王义成
    符合毛泽东思想的正确领导就应该服从，符合毛泽东思想的话就应该听，符合毛泽东思想的指示就应该坚决执行，这才是工人阶级的本色。有的人对于领导，对于领导的话，不分正确与否，一概不听，谁听了还说人家是“奴隶主义”。其实，这是他走上了无政府主义的歪路。
    我们厂运往大型轧钢厂的钢坯，有的钢号打错，有的打的不清，这样就会给国家财产造成损失。班长要我去检查。去不去呢？开始时，我拿不定主意。因为我看到有的人对领导的话任意不听，领导布置的工作随便不做，谁要服从领导，就说是“奴隶主义”。我想，如果我照班长的话做了，不也成了奴隶主义吗？想到这儿，心里就乱了。
    学习了毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，才使我转过弯来，对照毛主席的话，我想：这项工作如不及时检查，会造成好钢次用。我们工人阶级是国家的主人，能眼睁睁的看着不管吗？这时，我再用毛泽东思想去衡量那些所谓不做“奴隶主义”的人，才看清楚他们是被无政府主义迷住了心窍。我想，我们应当用毛泽东思想去辨别是非。班长要我去检查钢坯，是为了使国家财产不受损失，完全符合毛泽东思想，我应当坚决去做！
    心里的疙瘩解开了，决心也就大了。于是我就冒着刺骨的寒风，高高兴兴地来到大型轧钢厂，一手拿铁锤，一手拿铁钳，在钢坯堆中，反来复去查钢号，打钢字。在毛泽东思想的指导下，我不仅完成了班长交给我的检查任务，也提高了我的思想觉悟。
