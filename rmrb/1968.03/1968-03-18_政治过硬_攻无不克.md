Politics First, Invincible

Military Representative at a Certain Factory, Zhang Kede

Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed emphasizing politics and vigorously advocated for "striving to be first in technology." He opposes emphasizing proletarian politics, which in reality is to emphasize bourgeois politics, aiming to restore capitalism in China.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: "We must implement political leadership, with politics guiding technology and business." These teachings are absolute truths. Technology must be guided by proletarian politics, and technology must serve proletarian politics. Otherwise, no matter how good the technology is, it is of no use to the people or the revolution, and it may even be harmful.

In our factory, some engineers use technology as a tool to pursue personal fame and gain. They think about personal success, look up to foreign experts and capitalists. When the leadership assigns them a task, they think that working on this product won't allow them to write papers or gain personal benefits, so they work three days and rest two, resulting in the product not being completed on time.

Proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary workers take the path of emphasizing politics. We do not seek fame or personal gain; we have only one goal: "Serve the people wholeheartedly." During the Cultural Revolution, we overturned Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. As a result, in less than half a year, we completed the task that those engineers could not finish.

Even though our technology is inferior, we are not afraid. Before starting another task, we studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" for two full days, overcoming the fear of difficulties and risks. Before conducting experiments, we did not first check the circuits but instead checked each person's attitude of "being responsible to the people." To be responsible to the people, we dare to face problems and dare to negate our existing achievements, striving for perfection in technology. In this way, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we reduced the volume and weight of a device, which experts thought was impossible, by half in just twenty days.

Living facts make us further realize: If one's politics are strong and there is a red sun in one's heart, one dares to struggle and dare to win. No matter how difficult the technological barriers are, they can be overcome. If one's politics are not strong, thinking only of personal fame and gain, with selfishness leading the way, even the best technology cannot fully function. Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "technology first" is thoroughly defeated in the face of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

### 政治过硬　攻无不克

　　政治过硬　攻无不克
　　驻某厂军事代表　张克德
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对突出政治，极力鼓吹要“在技术上力争第一”。他反对突出无产阶级政治，实际上是要突出资产阶级政治，阴谋在中国复辟资本主义。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。林副主席教导我们：“要实行政治挂帅，政治统率技术和业务。”这些教导是千真万确的真理。技术必须由无产阶级政治统帅，技术必须为无产阶级政治服务，否则，技术再好，对人民、对革命也毫无用处，甚至还有害处。
    我厂有的工程师，把技术当作猎取个人名利的敲门砖，心里想的是个人成名成家，眼里看的是外国专家、资本家。领导上交给他们某项任务，他们认为搞这个产品不能写论文，个人捞不到“油水”，便三天打鱼，两天晒网，使得这项产品没有能够按质量完成。
    无产阶级革命战士和革命工人走的是突出政治的道路。我们一不为名，二不为利，只有一个心眼：“全心全意地为人民服务”。文化大革命中，我们一脚踢翻了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，用毛泽东思想指导一切，结果不到半年的时间就完成了那些工程师没有完成的那项任务。
    尽管我们技术差，但是我们不怕。在另一项任务动手前，我们整整学了两天《为人民服务》，克服了怕困难、怕担风险的思想。做试验之前，我们不是先检查线路，而是先检查每个人“向人民负责”的态度。为了向人民负责，我们敢于正视问题，敢于否定自己已有的成果，在技术上精益求精。就这样，靠了毛泽东思想，只用二十来天的时间把专家们认为没法办的一种仪器的体积和重量都减了一半。
    活生生的事实使我们进一步认识到：政治上过硬，心中有个红太阳，就敢于斗争，敢于胜利，再难的技术关，也能攻破；政治上不过硬，一心只想个人名和利，私字当头迷方向，技术再好也不能充分发挥作用。中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”的谬论，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想面前彻底破产了。
