Since last November, following the devaluation of the pound, a wave of gold buying has swept through the capitalist world. Under the impact of this wave, the dollar has experienced a serious crisis, and the capitalist financial and monetary system, which is based on the dollar, is beginning to collapse.

What exactly is the dollar crisis?

In the past, the currencies of many countries were made of gold or silver. In the capitalist era, the production and exchange of commodities developed significantly, and gold and silver coins were not only insufficient in quantity but also inconvenient to use. Thus, paper money emerged. In the era of imperialism, imperialist countries issued large amounts of paper money to plunder and exploit their own people and the people of their colonies. To make people believe that paper money is "reliable," they maintained a fixed exchange rate between paper money and gold and stored a certain amount of gold as a reserve to maintain the credibility of the currency. Internationally, if a country issues too much paper money and its gold and foreign exchange reserves decrease significantly, people will lose confidence in that country's currency, fearing devaluation. In such a situation, people will sell off that currency and exchange it for what they consider the most reliable currency or gold to avoid losses. The recent wave of gold buying is because the main currencies of the capitalist world, the dollar and the pound, have lost their value and credibility in people's eyes.

The dollar is the currency of the United States, and the pound is the currency of Britain. Before the two world wars, British imperialism had many colonies around the world. At that time, Britain issued a large amount of pound notes, exported capital to the world, and converted the plundered profits into gold, concentrating it in London. The currencies of many countries were exchanged with each other based on the exchange rate established between them and the pound. The pound became the main currency used in international trade and credit in the capitalist world.

American imperialism made a fortune during World War I, amassing a large amount of gold. In 1934, it announced a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold, allowing other countries to exchange one ounce of gold for thirty-five dollars at any time. After World War II, the United States became the world's number one imperialist country, with its economic power greatly expanded. It continuously concentrated the gold of Western Europe and other regions in its own hands. By 1949, the United States controlled 70% of the world's gold. Thus, the dollar replaced the pound's position and became the universally accepted currency in the capitalist world. Many countries directly used the dollar along with gold as the reserve for their own currency and international exchange. The once-invincible pound, along with the decline of British imperialism, became increasingly worthless and could only barely maintain its position by keeping a fixed exchange rate with the dollar.

In the early post-war period, many capitalist countries were weakened by the war, and their economic power was greatly reduced. Their currencies were naturally not trusted by others. In trade between capitalist countries, gold, dollars, or pounds had to be used for settlement. The dollar and the pound thus became the "international currency" of the capitalist world. The United States took advantage of the dollar's special status to expand its economy everywhere.

In recent years, the dollar's "hegemonic" position in the capitalist world has become increasingly difficult to maintain. Due to the law of uneven development in capitalism, the economic power of American imperialism has relatively declined in recent years. However, it has become even more frenzied in its expansionist and aggressive policies worldwide, exporting large amounts of capital, establishing military bases and deploying troops everywhere, waging wars of aggression, and using so-called foreign "aid" to support reactionary forces and plunder, resulting in enormous overseas expenditures. Although it relies on dumping goods abroad to achieve a trade surplus of several billion dollars each year, its international balance of payments still shows a deficit of tens of billions of dollars. The annual deficit in international payments has caused a large amount of dollars to fall into foreign hands, and foreigners use dollars to exchange for gold from the United States. As a result, the amount of gold in the United States is decreasing. It had $24.5 billion in gold in 1949, but this has now decreased to $10.4 billion. Meanwhile, the dollars and dollar bonds that foreigners can use to exchange for gold at any time have increased to more than $30 billion. At the same time, due to its frenzied military buildup and war preparations, the United States is facing a fiscal deficit, with annual budget deficits. The U.S. government uses the issuance of more dollars to cover the deficit, causing continuous inflation, and the actual value of the dollar has greatly decreased. Now, the purchasing power of the dollar is only about 40% of its pre-war level. The United States artificially maintains the fixed exchange rate of 35 dollars for one ounce of gold, as set in 1934, to maintain the dollar's position. However, the fact that the dollar is worthless is an ironclad fact. People in the capitalist world have long been concerned that the dollar will eventually have to be devalued.

After the pound was devalued last November, people became even more suspicious of the value of the dollar. Since the United States does not have a gold market and London is the largest gold market in the capitalist world, people began to buy gold in London as soon as they lost confidence in the dollar. Britain could not provide a large amount of gold, and the supply of gold could not meet the demand, causing the price to rise, which would break the fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold, leading to the devaluation of the dollar. Therefore, the United States had to use its stored gold to support it. This way, the United States' gold reserves decreased even more. After the gold-buying wave in the capitalist world in 1960, the United States, together with Britain and seven other countries, formed the "Gold Pool" to have these countries jointly provide gold to stabilize the gold price and support the dollar. However, due to the development of imperialist contradictions, France was the first to withdraw from the "Gold Pool," and the other countries were also at odds. This way, people became even more concerned about the devaluation of the dollar, rushing to sell their dollars in large quantities to exchange for gold. The gold-buying wave became more intense, and the United States' gold reserves decreased even more. It seems that the dollar cannot avoid devaluation.

The devaluation of the dollar is a major issue in the capitalist world. Countries and individuals holding dollars will suffer significant losses. The currencies of many countries will have to devalue along with the dollar. This will cause chaos throughout the capitalist world and accelerate the arrival of a major economic crisis in capitalism. Due to the increasing scale of the gold-buying wave, the United States had to request Britain to close the London gold market on the 14th of this month and invite some Western European countries to Washington for a meeting. At the meeting, it was decided to divide the gold market into two parts. One is the gold trading between the United States and various central banks, which will continue to be exchanged at the current exchange rate. The other is the "free market" for private transactions, where the price of gold can continue to rise. However, this measure does not solve the dollar crisis at all and can only make people more distrustful of the dollar. The U.S. government has no way to solve the dollar crisis, and the complete collapse of the dollar is inevitable.

From 1940 to 1967, the situation of U.S. currency circulation and gold reserves

In 1967, the currency circulation reached $182.1 billion, while the gold reserves decreased to $12.5 billion, and recently further decreased to $10.4 billion.

### 美元危机是怎么一回事？

    美元危机是怎么一回事？
    去年十一月以来，随着英镑宣布贬值，资本主义世界连续出现了抢购黄金的风潮。在这种风潮的冲击下，美元发生了严重的危机，以美元为主体的资本主义金融、货币体系开始走向崩溃。
    美元危机究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    从前，许多国家的货币是用黄金或者白银铸成的。到了资本主义时代，商品的生产和交换有了很大的发展，金银货币不仅数量不够，使用也不方便，于是出现了纸币。到了帝国主义时代，帝国主义国家更是通过大量发行纸币，来掠夺剥削本国人民和殖民地人民。为了使人们相信纸币是“靠得住的”，它们都使这种纸币和黄金维持一定比价，并储存一批黄金，作为发行纸币的保证金，以维持货币的信用。在国际上，如果一个国家的纸币发行过多，黄金和外汇储备大量减少，人们就会不相信这个国家的货币，怕它贬值。在这种情况下，人们就会抛出这种货币，换成他们认为最可靠的货币或者黄金，来使自己免受损失。最近发生抢购黄金的风潮，就是因为资本主义世界的主要货币美元和英镑不值钱了，在人们心目中失掉了信用。
    美元是美国的货币，英镑是英国的货币。两次大战以前，英帝国主义在全世界有许多殖民地。那时候，英国发行了大量英镑纸币，向全世界输出资本，同时把掠夺来的利润换成黄金，集中在伦敦。许多国家的货币，都按它们同英镑之间建立的比价，来进行相互之间的兑换。英镑成了资本主义世界国际贸易和信贷中使用的主要货币。
    美帝国主义在第一次世界大战中发了战争横财，掌握了大量黄金。它在一九三四年宣布了美元黄金的固定比价，其他国家可以随时用三十五美元向美国兑换一盎司黄金。第二次世界大战以后，美国成了世界上头号帝国主义国家，经济实力大大地膨胀，并且把西欧和其他地区的黄金源源不断地集中在自己手里。到一九四九年，资本主义世界黄金的百分之七十为美国所掌握。这样，美元就取代了英镑的地位，成了资本主义世界到处通行的货币。许多国家都直接拿美元同黄金一起作为本国货币和国际汇兑的储备。而曾经不可一世的英镑，随着英帝国主义的日益没落，越来越不值钱，只是依靠同美元保持一定的比价，勉强维持自己的地位。
    战后初期，许多资本主义国家在战争中伤了元气，经济实力大大削弱，它们的货币自然不被人家相信。在各资本主义国家之间进行贸易，都得用黄金、美元或者英镑结存。美元和英镑便成了资本主义世界中的“国际货币”。美国就利用美元的这种特殊地位到处进行经济扩张。
    美元在资本主义世界的“霸主”地位，近年以来越来越难以维持。由于资本主义发展不平衡的规律，美帝国主义的经济实力近年来已相对下降，但是它仍然在全世界更加疯狂地推行扩张侵略政策，大量输出资本，到处建立军事基地、派驻军队，进行侵略战争，用所谓对外“援助”来支撑各国反动派和进行掠夺，国外开支十分巨大。虽然它靠了向外国倾销商品，每年对外贸易有几十亿美元的盈余，但是国际收支却仍然要出现十几亿到几十亿美元的亏空。连年的国际收支逆差，使大量美元落到外国手里，外国就拿美元向美国兑换黄金。结果，美国手中的黄金越来越少。它一九四九年掌握着价值二百四十五亿美元的黄金，最近已减少到一百零四亿美元。而外国可以随时用来兑换黄金的美元和美元债券，却越来越多，早已超过三百亿美元。同时，美国由于疯狂地扩军备战，财政上入不敷出，连年出现巨额赤字。美国政府用滥发美钞来抵补，造成通货不断膨胀，美元的实际价值已大大下降。现在美元的购买力，只相当于战前的百分之四十左右。美国完全依靠人为的办法，硬把还是在一九三四年规定的三十五美元换一盎司黄金的比价固定不变，来维持美元地位。但是，美元不值钱了，却是个铁的事实。资本主义世界的人们早就担心，美元终有一天非宣告贬值不可。
    去年十一月，英镑宣布贬值之后，人们对美元的价值也更加怀疑。由于美国没有黄金市场，而伦敦是资本主义世界最大的黄金市场，所以人们一旦对美元不信任，就开始在伦敦掀起抢购黄金的风潮。英国拿不出大批黄金，而黄金又供不应求，价格上涨，就会破坏美元和黄金的固定比价，形成美元的贬值，因此，美国只好拿它储存的黄金去支持。这样一来，美国的黄金更加减少了。一九六○年资本主义世界发生抢购黄金风潮以后，美国纠合了英国等七个国家组成了“黄金总库”，要这些国家共同拿出黄金，妄图稳定金价，支持美元。但是由于帝国主义矛盾的发展，法国首先退出了“黄金总库”，其它国家也是貌合神离。这样，人们对美元贬值更加担心，争着把手里的美元大量抛出去换黄金。抢购黄金的风潮越闹越大，美国的黄金越来越少。美元要想不贬值，眼看是不行的了。
    美元贬值，这在资本主义世界是非同小可的问题。拥有美元的国家和个人都要吃大亏。许多国家的货币将不得不跟着美元一起贬值。这就会在整个资本主义世界造成一片混乱，加速资本主义经济大危机的到来。由于抢购黄金风潮的规模越来越大，美国不得不在本月十四日要求英国关闭伦敦黄金市场，同时邀请一些西欧国家到华盛顿去开会。会上决定把黄金市场分成两个。一个是美国同各国中央银行之间的黄金交易，仍旧按现在的比价兑换。一个是私人交易的“自由市场”，黄金价格可以不断上涨。但是，这个办法根本解决不了美元危机的问题，相反的只能使人们对美元更加不信任。美国政府没有办法解决美元危机，美元的彻底垮台是不可避免的。（附图片）
    1940——1967年美国货币流通量和黄金储备情况
    货币流通量在一九六七年高达一千八百二十一亿美元，同时黄金储备则下降到一百二十五亿美元，最近更下降到一百零四亿美元。
