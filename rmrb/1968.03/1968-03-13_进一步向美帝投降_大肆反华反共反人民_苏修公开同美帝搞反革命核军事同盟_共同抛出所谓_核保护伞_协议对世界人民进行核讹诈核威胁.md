The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists on March 7 formally announced at the 17-nation "disarmament" conference in Geneva their so-called agreement to jointly establish a "nuclear umbrella." This new and serious step in the counter-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union indicates that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has openly further aligned itself with U.S. imperialism in a nuclear military alliance against China and the revolutionary peoples of the world. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has taken another big step on the road of complete surrender to U.S. imperialism.

The U.S.-Soviet agreement to establish a "nuclear umbrella" was proposed several years ago by U.S. President Johnson, who called on the Soviet revisionists to respond. It is the product of a series of secret deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in recent months in Moscow, Washington, Geneva, and other places. This plot was hatched under the pretext of providing "security guarantees" to the "non-nuclear states" that are to participate in the "non-proliferation" treaty they are currently drafting.

On March 7, the U.S. and Soviet representatives, in unison, announced that they had reached an agreement. They will jointly submit a proposal to the United Nations Security Council with Britain, stipulating that they can take action through the Security Council or through "collective" action to provide "assistance" to "non-nuclear states" and establish a "nuclear umbrella."

The U.S.-Soviet plot to establish a "nuclear umbrella" is primarily directed against China.

For a long time, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have actively conspired to provide a "nuclear umbrella" to the reactionaries in India and other countries to tighten the encirclement of China. The U.S. representative to the Geneva "disarmament" conference, Foster, admitted to reporters that this "security guarantee" by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is actually based on the "guarantee" previously given by U.S. President Johnson to the Indian authorities and is intended to "expand" it. The British Daily Telegraph also acknowledged that the joint plan of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain is aimed at creating a "nuclear threat force" against China.

This new collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is closely linked to their plot to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are currently pushing this agreement to accelerate the signing of the "non-proliferation" treaty. This agreement further exposes the fraud of the U.S.-Soviet so-called "non-proliferation."

The U.S.-Soviet joint establishment of a "nuclear umbrella" is precisely to spread nuclear weapons everywhere, to impose nuclear control on "non-nuclear states," and to brazenly threaten the peoples of all countries with nuclear weapons. The draft of the "non-proliferation" treaty concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, together with the "nuclear umbrella" agreement, are evil plots by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to impose nuclear hegemony and nuclear blackmail.

The Soviet revisionists openly aligning themselves with U.S. imperialism in a nuclear military alliance against China and the peoples of all countries indicates that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is in a hurry to tighten its counter-revolutionary global collusion with U.S. imperialism. The United Press International openly boasts that this "nuclear umbrella" agreement is an "unprecedented cooperation" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and a "historic milestone" in their collusion. The shouts of the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine can only further expose the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that the U.S. imperialists have in their hands are paper tigers. The surging anti-U.S. tide of the peoples of the world is irresistible." In the face of the surging revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, any counter-revolutionary collusion by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists can only backfire, further arousing the peoples of the world to rise up against U.S. imperialism and its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionists, and bury the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and all their running dogs faster.

　　进一步向美帝投降　大肆反华反共反人民
　　苏修公开同美帝搞反革命核军事同盟
　　共同抛出所谓“核保护伞”协议对世界人民进行核讹诈核威胁
    新华社讯　美帝和苏修七日在日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议上，正式抛出了它们经过长期密谋策划的所谓共同建立“核保护伞”的协议。美苏反革命全球性勾结的这一新的严重步骤，表明苏修叛徒集团已经公开进一步同美帝国主义结成反对中国、反对世界革命人民的核军事同盟。苏修叛徒集团在向美帝全面投降的背叛道路上，又跨进了一大步。
    美苏共同建立“核保护伞”的协议，是美帝头子约翰逊几年前就提出要苏修加以响应的，是美苏近几个月来在莫斯科、华盛顿、日内瓦等地进行一连串秘密交易的产物。这个阴谋，是在对将要参与它们正在炮制的“防止核扩散”条约的“非核国家”提供“安全保证”的名义下出笼的。
    美苏代表在七日一唱一和地宣布它们已经达成协议，它们将伙同英国向联合国安理会提出一项提案，其中规定它们能够通过安理会“采取行动”，或者通过“集体的”行动，来对那些“非核国家”提供“援助”，建立“核保护伞”。
    美苏建立“核保护伞”的阴谋，矛头主要针对中国。
    长期以来，美苏就积极策划对印度和其他一些国家的反动派提供“核保护伞”，来加紧拼凑反华包围圈。美国参加日内瓦“裁军”会议代表福斯特对新闻记者承认，美苏这种“安全保证”，实际上就是依据美国总统约翰逊早先对印度当局作出过的“保证”，并使之“扩大化”。英国《每日电讯报》也供认，美苏英这个联合方案，是企图要起针对中国的“核威胁力量的作用”。
    美苏这一新勾结实际上是同它们推行的“防止核扩散”的阴谋紧密联系的。美苏目前抛出这个协议，也是企图加速签订“防止核扩散”条约。而这个协议恰恰进一步揭穿了美苏所谓“防止核扩散”的骗局。
    美苏共同建立“核保护伞”，正是要到处扩散核武器，对“非核国家”实行核控制，放肆地对世界各国人民进行核威胁。美苏炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案，连同“核保护伞”协议都是美苏实行核霸权、核讹诈的罪恶阴谋。
    苏修这样公开同美帝结成反对中国和世界各国人民的核军事同盟，表明苏修这伙叛徒正迫不及待地加紧同美帝的反革命全球性勾结，美国合众国际社毫不掩饰地宣扬，这个“核保护伞”协议是美苏之间的“空前的合作”，是美苏勾结的“一个具有历史意义的里程碑”。美帝宣传机器发出的这些叫嚷，只能更加暴露出苏修叛徒集团充当美帝头号帮凶的丑恶面目。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。”在蓬勃发展的世界人民革命斗争面前，美帝苏修进行的任何反革命勾结都只能搬起石头打自己的脚，更加激起世界革命人民反对美帝及其头号帮凶苏修的怒潮，更快地把美帝、苏修和它们的一切走狗埋葬掉。
