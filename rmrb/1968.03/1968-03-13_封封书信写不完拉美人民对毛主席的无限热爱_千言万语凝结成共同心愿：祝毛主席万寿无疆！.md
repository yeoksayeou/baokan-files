	Letters from Latin America express the boundless love of the people for our great leader Chairman Mao. Countless words of affection are condensed into a single wish: Long live Chairman Mao!

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Recently, from the fiery Latin America, where the flames of anti-American rage burn brightly, letters have been sent praising our great leader Chairman Mao. These letters, crossing mountains and seas, express the deep love and respect of the revolutionary people of Latin America for the great teacher Mao Zedong and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of people worldwide
	In the arduous revolutionary struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, the revolutionary people of Latin America constantly think of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. These letters from across the Pacific Ocean express this sincere sentiment in every line. They say: "Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the Lenin of our era." "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the people of the world, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world." A friend from Peru wrote in his letter: "We trust, respect, and admire the great teacher and great helmsman Mao Zedong. Our hope for complete liberation is vested in him." A friend from Colombia said: "Mao Zedong is the eternal sun in my heart. He holds high the red flag of the proletariat that flies in every corner of the world. The oppressed people of the world turn their gaze to Beijing, where the great leader of the people of the world, Mao Zedong, resides." Another friend from Colombia said that Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out the path for all revolutionaries worldwide to defeat the number one enemy—American imperialism. Chairman Mao has also given us a powerful ideological weapon to fight against modern revisionism. A friend from Chile sent a copper statue of Chairman Mao made from Chilean copper, expressing his boundless love for Chairman Mao.

	The letters cannot fully express the deep affection of the people of Latin America for Chairman Mao. Countless words are condensed into a single wish: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

	The people of Latin America love to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao"
	The revolutionary people of Latin America regard "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a treasure book for seeking liberation and study it eagerly. They say that carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" gives them confidence and the belief that the struggle will surely be victorious. Some Colombian workers, unable to hold a celebration due to the reactionaries' suppression on the 1967 May Day, gathered to study "Quotations from Chairman Mao," drawing spiritual strength for revolutionary struggle. A friend from Argentina under reactionary rule said: "Even if the reactionaries hang me, I will still read 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'"

	A friend from Chile said: "'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a powerful weapon and great intellectual treasure for the proletariat worldwide to fight against imperialism." A friend from Brazil said: "With one hand holding the great 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and the other holding a gun, the people can liberate themselves from the oppression and slavery of imperialism and its lackeys."

	Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb
	The letters from friends in Latin America enthusiastically praise the great Mao Zedong Thought. They say: Mao Zedong Thought is "a spiritual atomic bomb," "an ever-burning torch," "a guarantee of revolutionary victory." A friend from Chile wrote: Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly in the historical process of the people of the world. A friend from Colombia said: "The revolutionary people of Colombia firmly believe in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Although there is a great danger of Soviet revisionism, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the ultimate goal of communism will surely be achieved." A friend from Chile wrote that after studying Mao Zedong Thought, he criticized some of his previous erroneous ideas and began a new journey on the road to progress. He said: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought dispels the darkness and guides me forward."

	Insist on spreading Mao Zedong Thought
	Under the white terror of American imperialism and its lackeys in Latin America, spreading Mao Zedong Thought will result in arrests, imprisonment, and various forms of persecution. However, the revolutionary people of Latin America, to make Mao Zedong Thought take root among the people and make the masses recognize the truth of revolution, fearlessly insist on spreading Mao Zedong Thought. Friends from a South American country, since publishing Chinese books, have been arrested and imprisoned multiple times. Their residences and offices have been raided by the police multiple times, but their resolve to publish Chinese books remains unshaken. A revolutionary from another Latin American country was fired for spreading Mao Zedong Thought, but he remained undeterred. He said, "I will use more energy to spread Mao Zedong Thought. I will remove the bandages from the eyes of my people and let them see the light."

　　封封书信写不完拉美人民对毛主席的无限热爱
　　千言万语凝结成共同心愿：祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    新华社讯　最近，从燃烧着熊熊反美怒火的拉丁美洲，寄来了一封封热情歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的信件。这些信件越过千山万水，表达了拉丁美洲革命人民对伟大导师毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限崇敬。
　　毛主席是全世界人民心中的红太阳
    拉丁美洲革命人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的艰巨革命斗争中，时时刻刻想念着毛主席，想念着世界革命人民心中的红太阳。来自太平洋彼岸的这些信件在字里行间表达了这种真挚的感情。他们说：“毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代的列宁。”“毛主席是全世界人民的伟大领袖，是全世界人民心中的红太阳。”一位秘鲁朋友在他的来信中写道：“我们信赖、尊敬和钦佩伟大导师、伟大舵手毛泽东同志，在他身上，寄托了我们彻底解放的希望。”哥伦比亚一位朋友说：“毛泽东同志是我心中永远不落的太阳，他高举着在全世界一切地方飘扬的无产阶级红旗，世界被压迫人民的视线转向北京，在北京居住着世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志。”另一位哥伦比亚朋友说，毛主席英明地指出了我们全世界革命者打倒头号敌人——美帝国主义的斗争道路。毛主席还给了我们反对现代修正主义的强大的思想武器。智利的一位朋友随信寄来了一个他自己用智利特产的铜制成的毛主席像，表达他对毛主席的无限热爱。
    封封信件写不完拉丁美洲人民对毛主席热爱的深情，千言万语凝结成共同的心愿：祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
　　拉丁美洲人民爱读《毛主席语录》
    拉丁美洲革命人民把《毛主席语录》当作求得解放的宝书，如饥似渴地进行学习。他们说，身上带了《毛主席语录》就充满信心，坚信斗争一定取得胜利。一些哥伦比亚工人在去年“五一”国际劳动节时，由于反动派的镇压，无法举行庆祝活动，他们就聚集起来学习《毛主席语录》，汲取进行革命斗争的精神力量。处在反动统治下的一位阿根廷朋友说：即使反动派把我绞死，我也要读《毛主席语录》。
    一位智利朋友说：《毛主席语录》是全世界无产阶级反对帝国主义的强大武器和伟大的思想财富。一位巴西朋友说：“一手拿着伟大的《毛主席语录》，一手拿着枪”，人民就能够从帝国主义及其走狗的压迫和奴役下求得解放。
　　毛泽东思想是精神原子弹
    拉丁美洲朋友的来信，热情歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说：毛泽东思想“是精神原子弹”，“是永不熄灭的火炬”，“是革命胜利的保证”。智利一位朋友的来信说：毛泽东思想在全世界人民的历史进程中，永远放射着光芒。一位哥伦比亚朋友说：“哥伦比亚的革命人民深信战无不胜的毛泽东思想。当前尽管出现了苏联修正主义这样大的危险，但是有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，共产主义的最终目的一定能够达到。”智利一位朋友来信说，学习毛泽东思想后，他批判了原来的一些错误思想，开始了前进道路的新里程。他说：“毛泽东思想的光辉驱散了黑暗，指引我前进。”
　　坚持宣传毛泽东思想
    在美帝国主义及其走狗白色恐怖统治下的拉丁美洲，宣传毛泽东思想，就会遭到逮捕、监禁等种种迫害。但是拉丁美洲革命者，为了使毛泽东思想在人民中生根，使人民群众认识革命的真理，他们毫不畏惧，坚持宣传毛泽东思想。南美一个国家的几位朋友自从发行中国书刊以来，曾多次被捕入狱，他们的住所和办公室多次被警察捣毁，但是他们发行中国书刊的决心毫不动摇。另一个拉丁美洲国家的一位革命者由于宣传毛泽东思想被解雇了，但他一点也不动摇。他说，我要用更多的精力来宣传毛泽东思想，“我要使我国人民去掉眼睛上的绷带，重见光明。”
