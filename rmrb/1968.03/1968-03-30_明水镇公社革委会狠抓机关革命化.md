Following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Ming Water Township Revolutionary Committee in Heilongjiang Province has been striving for the revolutionary transformation of the office, significantly reducing meetings and reports. The committee members have set an example by going deep into the grassroots, rooting themselves among the people, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly reach the people and are turned into their actual actions.

A report from Xinhua News Agency in Harbin states that the Revolutionary Committee of Ming Water Township in Ming Water County, Heilongjiang Province, has been vigorously promoting the revolutionary transformation of the office. They have significantly reduced unnecessary meetings and reports, enabling the Revolutionary Committee to break free from bureaucratic routines and immerse themselves in the grassroots, among the people.

Since its establishment in September last year, the Ming Water Township Revolutionary Committee has proposed to streamline all unnecessary meetings and reports, allowing township cadres to root themselves among the people and participate in collective production, implementing face-to-face leadership. At that time, the Revolutionary Committee had just been established, and work was complex and varied. Some comrades suggested waiting until the work had made some progress before focusing on the revolutionary transformation of the office. The Revolutionary Committee addressed this mindset by organizing all cadres to repeatedly study the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. We must adhere to the mass line and consult with the masses on all matters, becoming students of the masses." This guided everyone to examine the harm caused by relying on meetings and reports for leadership. Meanwhile, the committee members led by example, changing their work style. At that time, it was the peak of the autumn harvest season. The responsible comrades of the township Revolutionary Committee led the committee's cadres to go deep into the production teams, working with the grassroots cadres and the masses to study how to grasp both revolution and production. They directly conveyed the tasks to be assigned to the people, achieving good results. Through this practice, all cadres further realized that whether or not to thoroughly change the work style is not just a matter of work methods but a matter of ideology, relating to whether the newly established Revolutionary Committee can wield power correctly. With improved ideological understanding, the Revolutionary Committee seized the opportunity to take further measures to achieve the revolutionary transformation of office work. Except for two cadres left in the office to handle daily work, the rest of the committee's cadres, led by the responsible comrades, went to the grassroots. At the same time, they streamlined meetings, resolutely not holding meetings that could be avoided, holding meetings at the grassroots level instead of higher levels, merging meetings that could be combined, and not holding long meetings when short ones would suffice. In a recent period, the county Revolutionary Committee convened a three-level cadre meeting to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After the meeting, the township Revolutionary Committee did not use meetings to convey and implement the spirit of the county Revolutionary Committee's meeting. Instead, the township cadres, carrying the spirit of the county Revolutionary Committee's meeting, went deep into the grassroots, working with the grassroots cadres and the masses to study how to turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into actual actions. From the Spring Festival to now, the township originally planned to hold three relatively large grassroots cadre meetings, which were later all handled by the township cadres going down to work with the grassroots cadres and the masses, achieving very good results.

The township Revolutionary Committee's decisive improvement in work style not only ensured that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions quickly reached the people and were turned into their actual actions but also greatly facilitated the grassroots, allowing grassroots cadres to have more time to participate in collective production.

    遵照伟大导师毛主席的教导，坚持群众路线
    明水镇公社革委会狠抓机关革命化
    革委会大量精简会议、表报，革委会成员以身作则，深入基层，扎根于群众，使毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速同群众见面，变为群众的实际行动
    新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江省明水县明水镇公社革命委员会狠抓机关革命化，大量精简会议、表报，使革命委员会跳出事务主义的圈子，深入基层，扎根在群众中。
    明水镇公社革委会去年九月成立后就提出，要精简一切不必要的会议和表报，让公社干部扎根在群众中，参加集体生产劳动，实行面对面的领导。当时革委会新成立，工作千头万绪，有的同志主张，等工作干出个眉目以后再搞机关革命化。公社革委会针对这种思想，组织全体干部反复学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”引导大家查找过去靠开会、要表报来进行领导的害处；同时革委会成员以身作则，带头改变作风。当时正是秋收大忙季节，公社革委会负责同志带领革委会的干部深入生产队，同基层干部和群众一起，研究怎样抓好革命和生产，把要布置的任务一竿子插到底，直接同群众见面，收到了良好效果。通过这次实践，全体干部进一步认识到，能不能彻底改变工作作风，决不是个工作方法问题，而是个思想问题，是关系到新生的革委会能不能掌好权、用好权的大问题。思想认识提高了，革委会又因势利导，进一步采取措施，实现机关工作革命化。革委会的干部，除留下两名在机关处理日常工作外，其余由革委会负责同志带领，分别到基层；同时精简会议，对一些可开可不开的会坚决不开，可在下面开的会坚决不在上面开，可合并开的会不单独开，可短开的会不长开。前一个时期，县革委会召开了落实毛主席最新指示的三级干部会议，会后，公社革委会没有采用开会的办法来传达贯彻，而是由公社干部带着县革委会会议精神深入下去，同基层干部和群众一起，研究怎样把毛主席的最新指示变为实际行动。从春节到现在，公社原来要开三次比较大的基层干部会议，后来都由公社干部到下面和基层干部、群众一起研究着把事情办了，效果都很好。
    公社革委会这样雷厉风行地改进作风，不但使毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速同群众见面，变为群众的实际行动，而且大大方便了基层，使基层干部腾出了更多的时间参加集体生产劳动。
