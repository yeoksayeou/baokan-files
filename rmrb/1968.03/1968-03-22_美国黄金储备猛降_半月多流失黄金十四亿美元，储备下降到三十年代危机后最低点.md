In the midst of the current financial crisis sweeping the capitalist world, the United States has seen a dramatic loss of gold over the past month and a half. The country has lost $1.4 billion in gold, surpassing the total gold loss for the entire previous year. This has brought the already dwindling gold reserves to their lowest point since the Great Depression of 1929-1933.

According to a statement released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on March 20, the U.S. government has allocated $1.4 billion in gold in four separate instances to cope with the current gold-buying frenzy. This has reduced the U.S. gold reserves to just $10.4 billion, the lowest level since the economic crisis that engulfed the entire capitalist world in the 1930s.

Since the devaluation of the British pound last November, the capitalist world has experienced three waves of gold-buying frenzies, resulting in a total loss of over $2.4 billion in gold for the United States. This figure is the largest annual gold loss in U.S. history.

In a letter to the U.S. Congress on March 20, President Johnson admitted with dismay that the prolonged international trade deficit poses a "direct and serious threat" to the United States. He exclaimed, "Time is of the essence," urging Congress to take immediate action.

    美国黄金储备猛降
    半月多流失黄金十四亿美元，储备下降到三十年代危机后最低点
    据新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：在当前资本主义世界金融危机风暴中，在短短半个多月，美国的黄金就流失了十四亿美元，比去年全年流失的黄金总额还多，使本来已经日趋枯竭的黄金储备下降到了一九二九——一九三三年大危机以来的最低点。
    据美国财政部二十日宣布，自三月一日以来，美国政府先后四次总共拨出十四亿美元的黄金应付这次抢购风潮，使美国的黄金储备减少到只剩下一百零四亿美元；这是自从三十年代波及整个资本主义世界的经济大危机以来的最低点。
    情况表明，自从去年十一月英镑贬值以来，资本主义世界接连爆发的三次黄金抢购风潮总共已经使美国损失黄金二十四亿多美元。这个数字比美国历史上任何一年的黄金流失额都要大。
    约翰逊二十日写给美国国会的信中沮丧地承认，旷日持久的国际收支逆差对美国造成的威胁是“直接的和严重的”。他惊呼“时不我待”，要求国会立即行动起来。
