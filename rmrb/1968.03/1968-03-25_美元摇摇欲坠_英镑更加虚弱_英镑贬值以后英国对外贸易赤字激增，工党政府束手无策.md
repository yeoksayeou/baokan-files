The current severe financial crisis in the Western world is not only accelerating the collapse of the dollar but is also dealing a heavy blow to the pound, which is closely linked to the dollar and is in a very fragile position. This has left the British ruling class, which has been desperately trying to salvage the pound's position, in a state of helplessness.

In recent years, British industrial production has stagnated, prices have soared, and especially the "lifeline" of the British economy, foreign trade, has continued to deteriorate. Earnings from overseas investments and revenues from shipping, insurance, and other businesses have also significantly decreased. This has resulted in a continuous large-scale deficit in the balance of payments, with the international payments deficit in 1967 increasing several times over that of 1966. The massive deficit in international payments has led to a significant increase in Britain's international debt and a rapid depletion of its gold and foreign exchange reserves. By the end of 1967, Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves were only 1.123 billion pounds, far from enough to cover Britain's debts. This situation has directly undermined the pound's position in the capitalist world.

To save the pound's position, the British ruling class has gone to great lengths. The devaluation of the pound announced in November last year was a desperate measure. The British ruling class hoped to use this "poisonous remedy" to "save" Britain's financial and economic ills and to restore the pound's position. They attempted to lower the price of British exports in the international market through devaluation, thereby enhancing competitiveness, reversing the massive trade deficit, improving the balance of payments, and ultimately improving the pound's position.

However, since the devaluation of the pound, the situation of British foreign trade has remained bleak. According to official figures, Britain's trade deficit for the first two months of 1968 has already exceeded 100 million pounds, far surpassing the level of the same period in 1967. This is because after the devaluation of the pound, the prices of imported raw materials and food also rose. Statistics show that the value of imports in the three months after the devaluation increased by 15% compared to the three months before the devaluation, while exports did not increase accordingly. Since British industry mainly relies on imported raw materials, the increase in raw material prices has led to higher production costs, limiting the benefits of devaluation and thus affecting competitiveness. Moreover, after the devaluation of the pound, the Sterling Area further disintegrated, and competition in the capitalist world market intensified. All these factors have made the British ruling class's dream of stimulating exports and reducing imports through devaluation to improve foreign trade and the balance of payments face the prospect of failure.

It should be noted that after the devaluation of the pound, which is the first line of defense for the dollar, the Western world's trust in the dollar has further shaken, exacerbating the dollar crisis and promoting the outbreak of the Western financial crisis; while the dollar crisis, in turn, has become the current fatal threat to the pound. For more than a decade, the pound has relied on the support of the dollar to maintain its position as a "reserve currency" in the capitalist world. Today, the dollar is already in a state of self-preservation and cannot afford to support the pound; moreover, since people do not want the dollar, they are even less likely to want the pound, which is in an even weaker position. This is the reason why the pound has been subjected to particularly severe attacks in the recent gold-buying frenzy in the capitalist world.

The British Labour government is particularly concerned that if this financial crisis continues to develop, not only will the pound be affected, but the British economy will also face a crisis. In this situation, the Labour government is in a state of panic and confusion. After hastily closing the London gold market, which was the most severely affected by the dollar-pound shock at the request of U.S. President Johnson, the Labour government hurriedly closed the foreign exchange market and ordered banks to "close for business," even closing markets for various commodities such as silver, tin, rubber, timber, and flour in an attempt to ease the shock to the dollar and pound. At the same time, the British ruling class is borrowing heavily from abroad and increasing taxes at home, ruthlessly demanding that the working people "tighten their belts."

All this fully reflects the British ruling class's lack of confidence and means to save the pound's position. It is deeply mired in a crisis from which it cannot escape.

    美元摇摇欲坠　英镑更加虚弱
    英镑贬值以后英国对外贸易赤字激增，工党政府束手无策
    新华社伦敦二十三日电　当前西方世界的严重金融危机不仅加速着美元的垮台，而且也特别沉重地打击了和美元有千丝万缕联系、地位十分脆弱的英镑，使得一直在费尽心计妄图挽救英镑地位的英国统治集团陷入了一筹莫展的境地。
    近年来，英国工业生产停滞，物价飞涨，特别是作为英国经济“生命线”的对外贸易不断恶化，海外投资的利润和航运、保险等事业的收入也大大减少，这就使得国际收支连年出现巨额逆差，一九六七年的国际收支赤字剧增为一九六六年的好几倍。巨额的国际收支逆差引起英国国际债务的大量上升和黄金外汇储备的日益枯竭。一九六七年底，英国的黄金外汇储备只有十一亿二千三百万英镑，远不足以抵偿英国所负的债务。这种状况直接打击了英镑在资本主义世界的地位。
    为了挽救英镑地位，英国统治集团费尽了周折。去年十一月宣布英镑贬值，就是它们迫不得已的黔驴末技。英国统治集团企图用这种“饮鸩止渴”的办法来“解救”英国财政经济的痼疾，挽救英镑的地位。它们妄图通过英镑贬值，使英国出口货的价格在国际市场上相对降低，以加强竞争能力，扭转对外贸易巨额逆差，改善国际收支状况，进而改善英镑地位。
    然而，英镑贬值以来，英国对外贸易的情况仍然不妙。据官方公布，一九六八年英国头两个月的对外贸易赤字已达一亿英镑以上，大大超过了一九六七年同期的水平。这是由于英镑贬值后英国进口原料和食品的价格随之上升，据统计，英镑贬值后的三个月的进口值比贬值前三个月增加了百分之十五，而出口却不能相应增加，因为英国的工业主要靠进口原料来维持，原料既涨价，工业品的成本就提高，这就使出口价格从英镑贬值所得到的好处有限，竞争能力也就因而受到影响。加之，英镑贬值后，英镑区进一步解体，资本主义世界市场上竞争加剧。这一切，都使得英国统治集团想通过英镑贬值刺激出口、减少进口，借以改善对外贸易和国际收支的美梦面临着破灭。
    需要指出的是，作为美元第一道防线的英镑贬值后，西方世界对美元的信任更加动摇，从而加剧了美元危机，促进了西方金融危机的爆发；而美元的危机又反过来成为英镑当前致命的威胁。因为十多年来，英镑一直是靠美元的支持来维持它作为资本主义世界“储备货币”的地位的。今天，美元已经是泥菩萨过河自身难保，就无力顾及英镑；而且人家既然不要美元，就更不要地位比美元更加虚弱的英镑，这就是在最近资本主义世界抢购黄金的风暴中英镑受到特别猛烈的冲击的原因。
    英国工党政府特别担心的是：这场金融危机发展下去，不仅英镑会遭殃，而且英国经济也将爆发危机。在这种情况下，工党政府手忙脚乱，不知所措。工党政府应美国总统约翰逊的要求仓促关闭了对美元英镑冲击最猛烈的伦敦黄金市场之后，又慌忙关闭了外汇交易所，并下令银行
  “休假”，甚至连白银、锡、橡胶、木材、面粉等各种商品市场也通通关门，妄图缓和对美元英镑的冲击。与此同时，英国统治集团又向外国大举借债，并在国内大增苛捐杂税，恶狠狠地要劳动人民“勒紧裤带”。
    这一切充分反映了英国统治集团对挽救英镑地位毫无信心，毫无办法，它深深陷在不可解脱的危机之中。
