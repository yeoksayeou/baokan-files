The Heroic Collective of the 1124 Construction Site's Five Battalions, in the process of fighting a rare large-scale landslide for over twenty days and nights, where it was most dangerous, the voices of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations were the loudest, and the cadres and soldiers fought bravely there. They composed a triumphant song of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application"!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application."

Where does the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site excel in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works? They excel in following Chairman Mao's great teachings, establishing a revolutionary study style of combining theory with practice. In this heroic collective, whoever studies and applies it is praised by everyone, and others actively learn from them; whoever studies but does not apply it is helped by everyone to change. Over the past few years, these five battalions have seriously implemented the principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, combine study with use, learn what is urgently needed, see results immediately, and focus on the 'application'." They have studied in conjunction with their ideological and work realities, applied what they have learned, rooted it in their minds, and implemented it in their actions.

How did they establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao?

The Most Fundamental Way to Establish a Revolutionary Study Style is to Grasp the Sentiments and Attitude Toward Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

The five battalions of the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site believe that establishing a revolutionary study style fundamentally depends on grasping the sentiments and attitude toward Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. To help cadres and soldiers understand this issue, they initiated a large-scale discussion.

The Party branch of the 7th Battalion organized everyone to analyze the changes in soldier Xu Lianqing: Xu Lianqing is a knowledgeable youth, one of the most educated in the battalion, and understands many principles. He comes from a poor background but was influenced by old novels and had some bourgeois ideas. When the platoon leader asked him to study Chairman Mao's works to reform his thoughts, he was unhappy upon hearing the word "reform." During a class education session, Political Instructor Pang Peiqiong inspired him to recall bitterness and sweetness: Xu Lianqing's grandfather worked for a landlord for 48 years and was driven out to die of hunger. His father continued working for 14 years and also died of illness. His mother gave birth to him in a stable and then carried him around begging for food. After liberation, his mother became a women's leader, and Xu Lianqing started school at the age of eight, becoming the first educated person in three generations. It was the most beloved Chairman Mao who changed the fate of his family. Xu Lianqing thought more and more about how he had wronged Chairman Mao, saying, "Forgetting this is forgetting one's roots." From then on, his thoughts and feelings underwent a profound change. With deep class feelings, he studied Chairman Mao's works and focused on the "application." In the life-and-death struggle with the large-scale landslide, he loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings, "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other," and rushed into the "tiger's mouth" filled with falling rocks to rescue his class brothers, fighting continuously for eleven hours.

Other battalions also analyzed similar cases like Xu Lianqing's. Why did the same person not apply what they learned in the past but apply it well now? The five battalions reached a common conclusion through discussion: the fundamental issue is whether one's class feelings toward Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought are deep or not. Based on this, the Party branches of each battalion organized cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work" and "Reform Our Study." Chairman Mao said: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thought method of the leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is an issue of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism. It is an issue of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since it is like this, the issue of study style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue." Everyone linked their own experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and shared their feelings with many facts. Some comrades said, "Whoever loves Chairman Mao the most applies it the best, whoever has the most 'public' spirit in their mind." Others said, "Only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao can one focus on the 'application'." Through the discussion, everyone realized: only by finding the gap in one's sentiments and attitude toward Chairman Mao can one find the root cause of not focusing on the "application," thereby fundamentally solving the problem of not focusing on the "application."

Over the past few years, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although the five battalions were working in the dense forests of the mountains, they kept the class struggle in mind. The Party branches often guided cadres and soldiers to discuss the facts of the two-line struggle, to see the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in opposing Mao Zedong Thought, to think about their own sacred responsibility to study, execute, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought; to discuss Vice Chairman Lin's outstanding contributions in vigorously advocating the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to see Vice Chairman Lin's brilliant example of being infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, to think about their own attitude toward studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; to discuss their own growth, family changes, army development, national prosperity, and world prospects, to see the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, to think about their urgent need to master Mao Zedong Thought. In addition, the Party branches continuously organized cadres and soldiers to recall bitterness and sweetness, to praise Chairman Mao's great achievements, to severely criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to strengthen the deep class feelings of cadres and soldiers toward Chairman Mao. The five battalions presented a lively scene of studying with deep class feelings and applying with deep class feelings. Cadres and soldiers said, "We do as Chairman Mao says." "We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example and wholeheartedly study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought."

Continuously Inspiring the Spirit of Self-Revolution is the Key to Establishing a Revolutionary Study Style

In the past, some cadres and soldiers in the five battalions studied Chairman Mao's works, applied them well to others, but not to themselves; they spoke well but could not correctly handle personal issues; they were good in the battalion but differed when away from leadership and the collective. The essence of these manifestations is the "self" interfering, lacking the spirit of self-revolution. Therefore, the Party branches of the five battalions, in the process of guiding cadres and soldiers to establish a revolutionary study style, continuously inspired the spirit of self-revolution among cadres and soldiers, guiding comrades to voluntarily fight against selfishness, actively fight against selfishness, and fiercely fight against selfishness, focusing on the "application," and achieving good results.

Party member Shi Junfu of the 8th Battalion received several letters from his mother asking him to return home, and he handled them poorly each time due to his "selfish" thoughts. Later, his mother sent another letter. Shi Junfu had intense inner struggles, and at this critical moment, the Party branch assigned the Party small group leader to help him fight against selfishness at this crucial juncture. The Party small group leader pointed out in a heart-to-heart talk: only by correctly handling it yourself can you educate your mother to handle it correctly, only by carrying out self-revolution can you help your mother revolutionize. With the help of the Party branch, Shi Junfu studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, fiercely fought against selfish thoughts, and severely criticized the "public and private fusion" fallacy advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev in his black "Cultivation." The inner struggle was won, and Shi Junfu immediately wrote a long letter to his mother at night, writing down all his experiences of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and helping his mother recall bitterness and sweetness, remembering the source of the water. Soon, his mother replied, and on the envelope, she wrote Chairman Mao's quotation: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out." Shi Junfu opened the letter and saw that his mother had fiercely fought against selfishness, raised her awareness, and proposed to learn from her son. The Party branch promptly publicized the spirit of self-revolution of Shi Junfu and his mother and the good study style of learning and applying immediately.

The Party branches of other battalions also did like the 8th Battalion, through lectures, reports, introducing experiences, and praising good deeds, doing a large amount of detailed ideological and political work, inspiring the self-awareness of cadres and soldiers in self-revolution, and cultivating the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight against selfishness. Cadres and soldiers felt in practice: learning and applying immediately requires wholeheartedly serving the public, without the slightest selfishness. Some comrades said, "Chairman Mao's books, every word and sentence are public. Learning with the 'self' character, not a single word can be learned well, not a single sentence can be applied."

What Kind of Model to Establish is What Kind of Study Style to Establish

The Party branches of the five battalions of the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site believe: establishing what kind of model is establishing what kind of study style. Firmly establishing models that focus on the "application" can greatly promote the establishment of a revolutionary study style. They encountered several issues in establishing models:

First, what kind of model to establish? There was a period when some cadres saw who read more chapters of Chairman Mao's works, wrote more insights, and spoke more principles, and considered them to have studied well, without investigating and understanding how that comrade linked their thoughts and work realities, and praised them. The Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's statements on combining theory with practice, correcting this bias. The Party branch vigorously cultivated and established models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a practical and solid manner, vigorously publicizing and promoting the advanced experiences of such models. The five battalions have prominently established a large number of models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application," since 1965, and there are increases every year. Old models have new developments, and new models have new heights. These models spread the revolutionary study style of combining theory with practice.

Second, are models that focus on the "application" allowed to have shortcomings? If there are shortcomings, should they be established or not? Is it education and help, or is it neglect and indifference? There was a debate in the 8th Battalion's initial evaluation of the Four Good Units last year: Feeder Li Helan focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, overcoming the reluctance to raise pigs, establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, and self-reliantly gathering pig feed all over the mountains. The shortcoming was that he had quarreled with another soldier, and later he actively sought out the soldier for a heart-to-heart talk and made self-criticism. In the discussion on whether to establish Li Helan as a model of focusing on the "application," some disagreed, reasoning that "he had quarreled with others." The Party branch of the 8th Battalion believed: establishing or not establishing comrades like Li Helan as models of the battalion's studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is an issue of establishing or not establishing a revolutionary study style. They organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "If you can apply the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to explain one or two practical problems, then you will be praised and have achieved some success." Making everyone realize: Li Helan focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in fighting against selfishness, which is the root, the mainstream, and quarreling with others is a non-mainstream aspect. Under the continuous help of the leadership and the masses, Li Helan applied it better and better, and was evaluated as a Five Good Soldier at the end of the year. Establishing such models plays a good role in establishing a revolutionary study style.

Third, is summarizing model experiences mobilizing the masses, or relying on a few people? This is a question of whether the model can play an exemplary role among the masses and whether the revolutionary study style can be spread among the masses. The Party branch of the 2nd Engineering Battalion, where the martyr Liu Guolu was once stationed, has deep feelings about this. Liu Guolu is a prominent representative of the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site, but his deeds and experiences were not summarized before, the reason being that the masses were not mobilized. After Liu Guolu's heroic sacrifice, the Party branch mobilized all the cadres and soldiers in the battalion to recall Liu Guolu's moving deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works before his death, and summarized his experiences of focusing on the "application." Cadres and soldiers said: "We attended a lively class of Mao Zedong Thought. The summarized model experiences touched our souls." The process of the masses summarizing model experiences is the process of the masses learning from models and is also the process of the masses establishing a revolutionary study style. Cadres and soldiers said: "Studying and applying actively relies on models to lead the way, and the revolutionary study style relies on models to spread."

The Revolutionary Study Style Relies on Cadres to Lead, and the Cadres' Revolutionary Study Style Relies on the Party Branch to Grasp

The revolutionary study style of the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site is led by the cadres. The soldiers said: Our site's cadres have three leading roles: leading in "loyalty," leading in "application," and leading in "public spirit."

The cadres of the five battalions, after studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, immediately implemented them in action, setting an example for the soldiers. The cadres studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and with actual actions, fiercely fought against selfish thoughts and severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev with their personal experiences. They led in shining, fighting, and changing. Deputy Battalion Commander Zhang Lianqi, when serving as a platoon leader in the 9th Battalion, was known as the "leader of soldiers breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit." He deeply felt: "Only commanders who break selfishness and establish public spirit can lead the battle of breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit well." The cadres studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "Our cadres must care for every soldier," and with deep proletarian feelings, cared for and loved the soldiers politically, in work, and in life. Deputy Political Instructor Wang Guiting, when returning to Shanghai on leave, the first big thing he did was to buy Chairman Mao's works for the soldiers. Wang Guiting himself actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and led two soldiers in the battalion to focus on the "application," becoming active learners. The cadres studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers" and "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." Whether they were old cadres or new cadres, regardless of night shifts or day shifts, in wind or rain, they regarded participating in labor as a need to prevent and combat revisionism and achieve ideological transformation. They led in entering the cave and led in exiting the cave, discovering dangers first in critical moments. Battalion Commander Gao Guicheng, in the battle to subdue the "tiger's mouth," explored the situation in the tiger's den eight times before the battle and continuously commanded the battle for three shifts of 24 hours without leaving the dangerous area during the battle. The soldiers said: "Our site's cadres are not special, each is a screw, and they function wherever they are tightened." Many cadres in the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site are active learners of studying Chairman Mao's works.

Cadres leading by example is also the result of the Party branch's efforts. Some cadres in the five battalions once "led well in work but poorly in leading the study and application of Chairman Mao's works." The Party branch, in the process of guiding cadres and soldiers to establish a revolutionary study style, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor," firmly grasped the cadres leading in focusing on the "application," setting an example for the soldiers. In the 1966 Four Good Units comprehensive evaluation, the soldiers gave the cadres the most pointed opinion: "The application of studying Chairman Mao's works is not focused." The Party branch immediately conducted investigations and research, finding two reasons: one was shallow class feelings, and the second was not going to the masses. Therefore, they organized cadres to recall bitterness and sweetness, studied the advanced units' experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, with deep class feelings, studied and applied immediately; at the same time, organized cadres to go to the masses to break selfishness and establish public spirit, learning from the soldiers. The battalion commander went to the 3rd Platoon, and the political instructor went to the 1st Platoon. After a lecture, the soldiers pointed out to Political Instructor Pang Peiqiong: "The principles are well spoken, but the soul is not deeply touched." The Party branch helped Pang Peiqiong study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and he went deep into the masses again, shining his thoughts with the soldiers, fighting against selfishness, changing shortcomings, and later lectured to the entire battalion, which was well received by the soldiers. The political instructor's actions inspired all the cadres in the battalion, and they all followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "Put down the stinky airs and be willing to be a small student," generally achieving: shining thoughts with the masses, fighting against selfishness under the masses' supervision, and changing shortcomings evaluated by the masses.

The Party branches of the five battalions realized through practice: the Party branch manages cadres only by grasping the root, and the cadres can lead to a good study style. In 1966, the 2nd Engineering Battalion transferred a new platoon leader named Li Jiguang. Originally, he was worried about his poor work ability, and when he was assigned to the 3rd Platoon, which had not been evaluated as a Four Good Unit, he found that the 3rd Platoon had many problems, and his mental burden became heavier. Especially when the battalion praised the 1st and 2nd Platoons, he became anxious and criticized the lower-level platoon leaders and soldiers. After the Party branch discovered this situation, they assigned Secretary Gao Guicheng to help him. Gao Guicheng, in a heart-to-heart talk with Li Jiguang, repeatedly spoke of the logic: leading in a thousand ways, leading in ten thousand ways, not leading in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in focusing on the "application," leading in nothing. Li Jiguang was deeply moved. From then on, under the continuous help of the Party branch, he no longer considered work ability but how to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application." Li Jiguang led in learning and applying, setting a good example for all the soldiers in the platoon, and brought the entire platoon into action. Later, the 3rd Platoon was evaluated as a Four Good Platoon, and Li Jiguang was selected as an active learner of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire battalion. The Party branch promoted his experience, which had a great educational impact on all the cadres in the battalion.

    学风问题是第一个重要的问题
    ——一一二四工地英雄集体活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验
    一一二四工地英雄集体五个连队，在同一场罕见的大塌方持续战斗二十多个昼夜的过程中，那里最危险，那里朗读毛主席语录的声音最响亮，干部战士就在那里奋勇战斗。他们谱写了一曲活学活用毛主席著作、在“用”字上狠下功夫的凯歌！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”
    一一二四工地英雄集体活学活用毛主席著作好在那里？好在他们遵循毛主席的伟大教导，树立了理论联系实际的革命好学风。在这个英雄的大集体中，谁学了就用，人人称赞，主动向他学；谁学了不用，人人热情帮他改。几年来，这五个连队认真贯彻林彪副主席提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”一整套原则，结合思想实际和工作实际学，学了就用，扎根在脑子里，落实到行动上。
    他们是怎样树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风的呢？
        树立革命学风最根本的要
    抓对毛主席、毛泽东思想的感
    情和态度
    一一二四工地英雄集体五个连队党支部认为：树立革命好学风，抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的感情和态度，是最根本的一条。为了帮助干部战士认识这个问题，他们发动大家展开了一场大讨论。
    七连党支部组织大家分析了战士徐连庆前后的变化：徐连庆是个知识青年，论文化全连数得着，道理懂得不少。他出身很苦，但受旧小说影响，沾染了一些资产阶级东西。班长叫他学习毛主席著作改造思想，他一听“改造”二字就不高兴。在一次阶级教育中，指导员庞培忠启发他忆苦思甜：徐连庆祖父给地主扛活四十八年，被撵出门饿死。父亲接着扛活十四年，又病死。母亲在一个马棚里生下他后，就抱着他到处讨饭。解放后，母亲当了妇女主任，徐连庆八岁上学念书，成了祖辈三代中第一个有文化的人。是最最敬爱的毛主席使他们一家翻了身。徐连庆越想越觉得对不起毛主席，他说：“忘记了这些，就是忘本。”从此，他的思想感情发生了深刻变化。他怀着深厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。在和大塌方进行生死搏斗中，他高声朗诵着毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，冲进落石如雨的“老虎口”抢救阶级弟兄，连续奋战了十一小时。
    其他连队也分析了类似徐连庆这样的情况。同一个人为什么过去学了用不上、现在学了用得好呢？五个连队在讨论中得出了共同答案：根本问题是对待毛主席、对待毛泽东思想的阶级感情深厚不深厚。在此基础上，各连党支部组织干部战士学习毛主席的《整顿党的作风》、《改造我们的学习》等光辉著作。毛主席说：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”大家联系自己活学活用毛主席著作的情况，并用大量事实谈了自己的感受。有的同志说：“谁对毛主席爱得最深，谁就用得最好，谁就头脑里‘公’字最多。”有的同志说：“只有无限忠于毛主席，才能在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”在讨论中，大家认识到：只有从对毛主席的感情上、态度上找差距，才能找到用得不狠的根本原因，从而从根本上解决用得不狠的问题。
    几年来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，五个连队虽然身在丛山密林施工，但胸怀阶级斗争风云。党支部经常引导干部战士摆两条路线斗争的事实，看中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，想自己学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的神圣责任；摆林副主席全力倡导活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的杰出贡献，看林副主席无限忠于毛泽东思想的光辉榜样，想自己活学活用毛主席著作的态度；摆个人的成长、家庭的变化、军队的发展、国家的兴旺、世界的前途，看毛泽东思想的无比威力，想自己迫切掌握毛泽东思想的需要。此外，党支部还不断通过忆苦思甜，大力颂扬毛主席的丰功伟绩，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，增强了干部战士对毛主席的深厚阶级感情。五个连队中出现了带着深厚阶级感情学，带着深厚阶级感情用的生动局面。干部战士说：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做”。“要以林副主席为光辉榜样，一心一意地学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想。”
      不断激发自我革命精神是树
  立革命学风的关键
    过去，五个连队中，有的干部战士学了毛主席著作，用于别人好，用于自己差；嘴上说得好，遇到个人问题就不能正确对待；在连队好，离开领导和集体就差。这些表现的实质就是“私”字作怪，缺乏自我革命的精神。因此，五个连队党支部在领导干部战士树立革命好学风的过程中，不断地激发干部战士自我革命精神，引导同志们自觉斗私，主动斗私，狠狠斗私，在“用”字上狠下功夫，收到了良好效果。
    八连党员石俊福几次接到母亲叫他回家的来信，他几次回信由于带着“私”字都没处理好。后来，他母亲又来了一封信。石俊福思想斗争很激烈，正在这时，党支部分工党小组长帮助他在这个节骨眼上斗私。党小组长在和他谈心中指出：只有自己正确对待，才能教育母亲正确对待，只有进行自我革命，才能帮助母亲革命。石俊福在党支部帮助下，学习了毛主席的有关教导，狠斗了私心杂念，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在黑《修养》中鼓吹的“公私溶化”谬论。思想斗争胜利了，石俊福就连夜给母亲写了一封长信，把自己斗私批修的体会全写上，还帮助母亲忆苦思甜，饮水思源。不久，母亲来信了，信封上写着毛主席语录：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”石俊福打开信一看，母亲狠斗了私心，提高了觉悟，提出向儿子学习。党支部及时宣扬了石俊福母子二人勇于自我革命的精神和学了就用、立竿见影的好学风。
    其他连队党支部也都象八连这样，通过讲用会、报告会、介绍经验、表扬好人好事，做了大量的细致的思想政治工作，启发干部战士自我革命的自觉性，培养勇于斗私的革命精神。干部战士在实践中体会到：学了就用，要一心为公，不能有半点私心。有的同志说：“毛主席的书，字字句句都是公，带着‘私’字去学，一字学不好，一句用不上。”
      树立什么样的典型，就是树
  立什么样的学风
    一一二四工地英雄集体五个连队党支部认为：树立什么样的典型，就是树立什么样的学风。坚定不移地树立在“用”字上狠下功夫的典型，就能大大促进革命好学风的树立。他们树典型遇到了这样几个问题：
    第一，树立什么样的典型？曾经有个时期，个别干部看那个同志学习毛主席著作篇数读得多、心得写得多、道理讲得多，就算他学得好，不去调查了解那个同志联系思想实际和工作实际怎样，就表扬了他。党支部组织大家学习毛主席关于理论联系实际的论述，纠正了这种偏向。党支部大力培养和树立学得实在、用得扎实的典型，大力宣扬和推广这种典型的先进经验。五个连队从一九六五年以来，突出地树立了一大批活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的典型，并且年年都有增加，老典型有新发展，新典型有新高度。这些典型传播了理论联系实际的革命好学风。
    第二，在“用”字上狠下功夫的典型，允不允许有缺点，有缺点树不树立，是教育和帮助，还是不管和不服？八连去年四好初评有这样一场争论：饲养员李合让活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫，斗倒了不愿养猪的私心，树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想，自力更生满山遍野打猪饲料，一个人用一周时间扛石头盖好了猪圈围墙。缺点是和另一个战士吵过嘴，事后主动找这个战士谈心作了自我批评。在讨论要不要树立李合让作为在“用”字上狠下功夫的典型时，有人不同意，理由是“和别人吵过嘴”。八连党支部认为：树立不树立象李合让这样的同志为连的活学活用毛主席著作典型，是个树立不树立革命好学风的问题。他们组织大家学习毛主席教导：“如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。”使大家认识到：李合让活学活用毛主席著作在斗私上狠下了功夫，这是根本，是主流，和别人吵嘴的缺点是非主流方面。在领导和群众不断帮助下，李合让用得越来越好，年终评为五好战士。树立这样的典型，对树立革命好学风起到很好作用。
    第三，总结典型经验是发动群众，还是依靠少数人？这是关系到典型能不能在群众中起榜样作用，革命学风能不能在群众中传播的问题。烈士刘国吕生前所在的工兵二连党支部在这方面体会很深。刘国吕是一一二四工地英雄集体中的一个突出代表，可是以前一直没有把他的事迹和经验总结出来，原因就是没有发动群众。刘国吕壮烈牺牲后，党支部发动全连干部战士回忆刘国吕生前活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹，并总结出他在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验。干部战士说：“上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课。总结的是典型经验，触及的是自己灵魂。”群众总结典型经验的过程，就是群众学习典型的过程，也是群众树立革命好学风的过程。干部战士说：“活学活用靠典型引路，革命学风靠典型传播。”
      革命学风靠干部带，干部的
  革命学风靠党支部抓
    一一二四工地英雄集体的革命好学风，是干部带出来的。战士们说：咱们工地上的干部有三带头：在“忠”字上带头，在“用”字上带头，在“公”字上带头。
    五个连队的干部学了毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示，马上落实在行动上，给战士带头做出样子来。干部学了毛主席最新指示：“要斗私，批修”，就以实际行动狠斗私心，用亲身经历猛批中国赫鲁晓夫。他们亮在前、斗在前、改在前。副连长张连启在九连当排长时就被称为“战士破私立公的带头人”。他体会很深地说：“只有破私立公的指挥员，才能指挥好破私立公的战斗。”干部学了毛主席“我们的干部要关心每一个战士”的教导，就以深厚的无产阶级感情从政治思想上、工作上和生活上关心爱护战士。副指导员王贵廷休假回上海，头一件大事就是为战士买毛主席著作。王贵廷自己积极地活学活用毛主席著作，并带动连部两个战士在“用”字上狠下功夫，成了学习积极分子。干部学了毛主席“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者”和“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，无论是老干部还是新干部，不分夜班日班，刮风下雨，他们把参加劳动当作防修反修、实现思想革命化的需要。进洞走在前，出洞走在后，关键时刻发现险情先上。连长高桂成在制伏“老虎口”一仗中，战斗前八次深入虎穴探险情，战斗中两次连续三个作业班二十四小时不离开险区指挥战斗。战士们说：“咱们工地上的干部毫不特殊，个个都是螺丝钉，拧在那里都发挥作用。”一一二四工地英雄集体中的干部，有不少是学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    干部带头做好样子，又是党支部抓出来的。五个连队干部中有的同志曾一度“工作带头带得好，活学活用毛主席著作带头带得差”。党支部在领导干部战士树立革命好学风的过程中，按照毛主席“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”的教导，狠抓了干部带头在“用”字上狠下功夫，给战士做好样子。七连在一九六六年四好总评中，战士们给干部提出最尖锐的意见是：学习毛主席著作用得不狠。党支部立即做了调查研究，找出了两条原因：一是阶级感情不深，二是没有到群众中去。于是，组织干部忆苦思甜，学习先进单位活学活用毛主席著作的经验，带着深厚的阶级感情，学了就用；同时，组织干部到群众中去破私立公，向战士学习。连长到了三排，指导员到了一排。在一次讲用会后，战士们对指导员庞培忠的讲用提出了“道理讲得多，灵魂触得不深”的意见，党支部就帮助庞培忠学习毛主席有关教导，他又深入到群众中去，和战士一起亮思想，斗私心，改缺点，后来又在全连讲用，很受战士欢迎。指导员的行动带动了全连干部，他们都遵循毛主席关于“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”的教导，普遍做到了：亮思想和群众见面，斗私心受群众监督，改缺点由群众讲评。
    五个连队党支部从实践中认识到：支部管干部只有管在根本上，干部才能带出好学风。工兵二连一九六六年调来一个新排长叫李济光，本来他就顾虑自己工作能力差，分他到未评上四好的三排当排长，发现三排的问题较多，他的思想包袱更大了。特别是连里表扬一、二排时，他着了急，就批评下面班长和战士。党支部发现这种情况后，分工支部书记高桂成负责帮助他。高桂成在和李济光谈心中，用自己的经历反复地讲千带头，万带头，不带学习毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的头，什么头也带不好的道理。李济光很受感动。从此，他在党支部的不断帮助下，考虑的不再是工作能力，而是怎样活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。李济光带头学、带头用，给全排战士做出了好样子，把全排带动起来了。后来，三排评为四好排，李济光被选为全连活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。党支部推广了他的经验，对全连干部教育很大。
