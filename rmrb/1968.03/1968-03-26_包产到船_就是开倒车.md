The class enemies we have overthrown—the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists—are always dreaming of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship state. They long for the old society. At any opportunity, they will stir up trouble and try to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." China's Khrushchev is the mastermind behind these people.

During the three years of temporary economic difficulties in our country, China's Khrushchev eagerly jumped out and vigorously promoted the "three autonomies and one contract" black goods, which once blew a gale of capitalist restoration in the countryside. This evil wind also blew into our fishing ground. At that time, a handful of capitalist roaders within the municipal and county party, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, hurriedly rushed to our fishing ground to implement the "responsibility to the boat" pilot project, giving the green light to the restoration of capitalism. After implementing "responsibility to the boat," several deep-sea vessels were contracted to a few households. Out of more than seventy small wooden sailboats, more than twenty were contracted to members to engage in individual operations. As a result, a few people with serious capitalist thoughts took the opportunity to leave collective production, fish and sell privately, engage in speculation, and severely weaken the collective economy, undermining the foundations of socialism. Even worse, class enemies took the opportunity to stir up trouble. A four-category element incited his daughter to take marine products to other places for speculation and to make huge profits. Facing these shocking facts, we poor fishermen felt that the "course" was wrong, so we firmly debated and struggled with the leaders of the fishing ground at that time. However, because they controlled the power of the fishing ground, they temporarily made the fishing ground chaotic. The deep-sea vessels set sail, and I stood on the bow, looking at the gradually distant fishing ground, feeling a chill in my heart, thinking: Isn't this reversing course and driving back to the old path of the old society? Only now do I understand that the culprit behind promoting "three autonomies and one contract" and blowing the "responsibility to the boat" evil wind in the fishing village is China's Khrushchev. The facts have proven that China's Khrushchev is trying to use the "responsibility to the boat" trick to drag us poor fishermen back to the old society where we had to catch fish and shrimp for the fish lords and starve to death. His heart is truly malicious!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining strength," and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, completely criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, thoroughly eliminate all his poison in the fishery, and forever follow the revolutionary course opened by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, advancing bravely!

### “包产到船”就是开倒车

    “包产到船”就是开倒车
    辽宁省金县大孤山公社捕捞场副场长　唐英周
    被我们打倒的地、富、反、坏、右分子时刻都在梦想颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义。毛主席教导我们说：“这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”中国赫鲁晓夫就是这种人的总后台。
    在我国三年经济暂时困难的时期，中国赫鲁晓夫迫不及待地跳了出来，大肆推行“三自一包”的黑货，一度在农村刮起了一阵复辟资本主义的单干风。这股妖风也刮到了我们捕捞场。当时，市、县党内一小撮走资派按照中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，急急忙忙跑到我们捕捞场搞“包产到船”的试点，为复辟资本主义大开绿灯。“包产到船”以后，远洋船只包给了几户。七十多只近洋木帆船，有二十多只包给了社员搞单干。这样一来，个别资本主义思想严重的人，便乘机脱离集体生产，打鱼私卖，投机倒把，严重削弱集体经济，挖了社会主义的墙脚。更可恶的是阶级敌人也趁机兴风作浪。有一个四类分子唆使他的女儿，拿海产品到外地去投机倒把，牟取暴利。面对这些触目惊心的事实，我们贫苦的渔民感到“航向”不对头，就坚决同当时捕捞场里的领导人进行辩论和斗争。但是，由于他们把持了捕捞场的大权，一时把捕捞场搞得乌烟瘴气。远洋船只出发了，我站在船头上，望着逐渐远离的捕捞场，心里直打寒颤，心想：这不是在扳倒舵，打倒车，往旧社会的老路上开吗！现在我才明白，推行“三自一包”，在渔村刮起“包产到船”妖风的罪魁祸首是中国赫鲁晓夫。事实证明，中国赫鲁晓夫就是企图通过“包产到船”的鬼名堂，把我们穷苦的渔民拉回到给渔霸打鱼摸虾、饿死全家的旧社会。他的心真歹毒啊！
    毛主席教导我们说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他在渔业上的一切流毒，永远沿着伟大舵手毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
