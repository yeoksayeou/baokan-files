In the midst of the Lao patriotic military and civilian people's anti-American national salvation struggle achieving victory after victory, the cultural and educational undertakings in the liberated areas of Laos have made significant progress. In the 1967-1968 academic year, the number of students enrolled in various places in the liberated areas of Laos has increased compared to the previous academic year. In the provinces of Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, and Savannakhet alone, there are more than ten thousand students.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and local educational departments attach great importance to the training of teachers and the construction of school buildings. The first batch of graduates from the Central Intermediate Normal School of Laos, totaling forty-two people, graduated at the end of last year and have already gone to various places to teach the more than four thousand five hundred primary school graduates who are advancing to middle school this year. This is the first time in Lao history, marking a new development in the cultural and educational undertakings in the liberated areas of Laos. The cultural improvement work in the liberated areas has also achieved remarkable results. So far, twelve villages in Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, Xieng Khouang, and Xam Neua have eliminated illiteracy, enabling thousands of workers to read and write. Savannakhet Province has opened more than a thousand cultural improvement classes, with more than twenty-three thousand students. In the provinces of Xam Neua, Xieng Khouang, Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, Xieng Khouang, and Luang Prabang, more than forty thousand people are studying in cultural improvement classes.

In addition, in the past year, the liberated areas have published a large number of books and periodicals, and for the first time, they have published an illustrated magazine reflecting the anti-American national salvation struggle and life of the Lao people.

To enrich the cultural life of the people, various provinces and counties in the liberated areas have established cultural and art troupes and cultural and art teams. Many townships have established amateur art teams, which inherit the excellent cultural and artistic heritage of the nation and create many new programs reflecting the people's struggle and production. Various art teams that travel to perform overcome numerous difficulties, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, to perform for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The film industry in the liberated areas is also developing. The liberated areas have their own film production studios and have already produced many newsreels.

    在老挝爱国战线党的亲切关怀下解放区文教事业飞速发展
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：在老挝爱国军民抗美救国斗争取得节节胜利的大好形势下，老挝解放区的文教事业得到很大的发展。在一九六七—一九六八新的学年里，老挝解放区各地就学人数比上一学年有所增加。仅芒塞、甘蒙和沙湾拿吉三省就有一万多名学生。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会和各地教育部门十分重视培训师资和建设校舍的工作。老挝中央中级师范学校首届毕业生共四十二人已于去年年底结业，并且已经奔赴各地，为今年升中学的四千五百多名小学毕业生任教。这在老挝历史上还是第一次，它标志着老挝解放区文化教育事业的新发展。解放区的文化进修工作也取得了显著的成绩。到目前为止，在川圹、甘蒙、芒塞和桑怒等省已有十二个村庄扫除了文盲，使数以千计的劳动者能够读书写字。沙湾拿吉省开办了一千多个文化进修班，有二万三千多名学员。桑怒、川圹、芒塞、甘蒙、会晒和琅勃拉邦六个省有四万多人在文化进修班里学习。
    此外在过去一年中，解放区出版大量书刊，并且还第一次出版画报，反映老挝人民的抗美救国斗争和生活情况。
    为了活跃人民的文化生活，各省、县解放区都纷纷成立了文工团和文工队，许多乡还成立了业余文艺队，他们继承民族优秀的文化艺术遗产，并且创作出许多反映人民的战斗和生产的新节目。各个进行巡回演出的文艺队，跋山涉水，克服重重困难，为广大工农兵演出。
    老挝解放区的电影事业也在发展中。解放区有了自己的电影摄制厂，已经拍摄了多部新闻纪录片。
