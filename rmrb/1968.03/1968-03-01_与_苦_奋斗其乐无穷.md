	Struggling with "Hardship" Brings Endless Joy
	Political Instructor of the 15th Company, a certain regiment, Wāng Yìngmíng

	Enduring hardships and toiling tirelessly is the hallmark of our engineering troops. Year after year, month after month, we swing our iron hammers, hold our wind drills, and battle in desolate mountains and remote wildernesses, on steep cliffs and precipices. We tread the small paths, build the great roads, live in tents, and construct barracks. We have grown up in the struggle against hardship.

	For whom do we endure hardships? Why do we endure hardships? Different classes have different answers to this question, reflecting different worldviews. For a long time, China's Khrushchev has been peddling the bourgeois view of hardship and joy. He shamelessly says: "Endure a bit of hardship," and you will "get benefits," "gain trust." In plain terms, it means: "Endure hardship today," and "there will be a good future tomorrow." This is a poison that corrupts people's souls, a potion that bewitches people into restoring capitalism.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never part from the masses; put the interests of the people first, not the interests of individuals or small groups... These are our starting points." We endure hardships with this as our starting point.

	Following Chairman Mao's teachings, our hardships are for the revolution, for the people, not for personal "good futures" as China's Khrushchev says. Therefore, in our construction work, we rush to where it is most difficult, we charge towards where there are the most hardships. Last summer, the 16th Squad was working in a trench over three meters deep. The scorching sun made everyone dizzy and nauseous. Squad leader Yú Xué'ēn, to let everyone drink more water, drank as little as possible himself, to the point of dehydration and fainting, hitting his head on a pillar. When his comrades revived him, his first words were, "Resolve to dare to die, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

	Every time we see vehicles speeding on the roads we have built, every time we conquer treacherous mountains and rivers, erecting iron walls, every time we stand ready, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, taking the oath to face even more arduous battles, we feel an immense joy, an immense happiness. We deeply understand that without our "hardships," there would be no sweetness for the Chinese people and the people of the world. To do a lifetime of revolution, one must be prepared to endure a lifetime of hardships. Many of our comrades in the company have deeply felt: The more hardships we endure, the more sweetness we bring to the people of the world.

	China's Khrushchev will never understand the proletariat's view of hardship and joy. Let China's Khrushchev's peddling of the speculator's business go to hell! The engineering troops who are forever loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao will never fall for your tricks!

    与“苦”奋斗其乐无穷
    某部十五连政治指导员　汪应明
    吃大苦，耐大劳，是我们工程兵战士的本色。年年月月，我们抡铁锤，抱风钻，奋战在荒山僻野，悬崖陡壁。我们走的是小路，修的是大道，住的是帐篷，盖的是营房。我们是在同“苦”字作斗争中成长起来的。
    为谁吃苦？为什么吃苦？对这个问题，不同的阶级有不同的回答，反映出不同的世界观。中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来大肆兜售资产阶级的苦乐观。他恬不知耻地说：“吃点苦”，就能“得便宜”，“受到信任”。说明白点，就是：“今天吃点苦”，“明天就有好的前途”。这是毒害人们灵魂的腐蚀剂，这是复辟资本主义的迷魂汤。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发……这些就是我们的出发点。”我们吃苦，就是以此为出发点的。
    遵循毛主席的教导，我们的吃苦是为革命，为人民，而不是象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样为了个人的“好的前途”。因此，我们在施工中，哪里艰苦就往哪里跑，哪里困难就往哪里冲。去年夏天，十六班在三米多深的工事里作业，烈日烤得人头晕眼花，班长于学恩同志为了让大家多喝水，自己就尽量少喝，以致流汗太多而虚脱，一头撞到柱子上。当同志们把他急救醒来时，他第一句话就是“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    每当我们看到一辆辆汽车在我们修建的公路上飞驰的时候，每当我们战胜险山恶水，筑下了钢铁长城的时候，每当我们整装待发，站在毛主席像前宣誓，去迎接更艰苦的战斗任务的时候，我们总感到无比的愉快，无比的幸福。我们深深懂得，没有我们的“苦”，就没有中国人民和世界人民的甜。干一辈子革命，就要准备吃一辈子苦。我们连的许多同志都深有体会地说：我们多吃一分苦，就给世界人民多争一分甜。
    中国赫鲁晓夫永远不能理解无产阶级的苦乐观。让中国赫鲁晓夫散布的投机商人的生意经见鬼去吧！永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席的工程兵指战员决不上你的当！
