In the economic sphere, fight a political battle
The revolutionary masses of Hubei Province launch a wave of frugality and revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 14 - The revolutionary masses of Hubei Province are earnestly studying and resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "building the country through frugality" and "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing," launching a wave of frugality and revolution.

The Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a provincial telephone conference, requiring all levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations in the province to mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to quickly launch a new high tide of the mass movement to further promote frugality and revolutionize. The conference pointed out that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei Province is excellent and getting better and better. However, the class struggle is still sharp and complex. The class enemies do not accept their own death and are using economic means to corrupt, which is an important form of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat at present. For every proletarian revolutionary, whether they can insist on frugality and revolutionize, and whether they can consciously resist the attack of "sugar-coated bullets," is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The conference called on the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses throughout the province to implement Chairman Mao's great policies of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," "building the country through frugality," and "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing" with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, the fastest speed, and the most resolute actions. They must strictly practice frugality, tighten expenditures, concentrate financial resources, ensure key needs, consolidate and develop our country's socialist economic strength and national defense strength, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and various municipal, district, and county revolutionary committees and preparatory groups recently held standing committee meetings or plenary meetings to discuss and formulate decisions on further promoting frugality and revolutionizing. Some places also held mass rallies. The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee put forward five requirements to the broad revolutionary masses of the city, calling on the people of the whole city to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to widely publicize, study, and implement Chairman Mao's great instruction on "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing," to grasp the class struggle, to break down the "selfish" mentality, to establish the "public" spirit, to further carry out revolutionary criticism, to eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and to quickly launch a new high tide of the mass movement of frugality and revolutionizing, fighting a political battle in the economic sphere.

Many local and unit revolutionary committees, preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the content of implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction on "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing." The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two military" also took the implementation of Chairman Mao's great instruction on "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing" as one of the main contents of their propaganda.

At present, a revolutionary upsurge of widely publicizing, studying, implementing, and carrying out Chairman Mao's great instructions on "building the country through frugality" and "further promoting frugality and revolutionizing" is surging in various parts of Hubei.

　　坚决执行毛主席指示进一步节约闹革命
　　在经济领域中打好政治仗
　　湖北广大革命群众掀起节约闹革命热潮
    据新华社武汉十四日电　湖北省各地广大革命群众认真学习、坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，掀起了节约闹革命的热潮。
    湖北省革命委员会最近召开了全省电话会议，要求全省各级革命委员会、革命委员会筹备小组和革命群众组织，发动广大革命群众迅速掀起进一步节约闹革命的群众运动新高潮。会议指出，当前，湖北省无产阶级文化大革命的形势一派大好，而且越来越好，但是阶级斗争仍然尖锐复杂。阶级敌人并不甘心自己的死亡，从经济上进行腐蚀，这是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个重要形式。对每一个无产阶级革命派来说，能不能坚持节约闹革命，能不能自觉地抵制“糖衣炮弹”的进攻，这是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。会议号召全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要以最高的热情、最大的决心、最快的速度、最坚决的行动，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”、“勤俭建国”、“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，严格厉行节约，紧缩开支，集中财力，保证重点需要，巩固和发展我国社会主义的经济力量和国防力量，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    武汉市革命委员会和各专、（市）、县革命委员会、革筹小组，最近也先后召开了常委会议或全体会议，讨论制订了进一步节约闹革命的决定，有的地方还举行了群众大会。武汉市革命委员会向全市广大革命群众提出了五条要求，号召全市人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大宣传、大学习、大落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，狠抓阶级斗争，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，进一步搞好革命大批判，肃清反革命经济主义流毒，促进人的思想革命化，迅速掀起节约闹革命的群众运动新高潮，在经济领域中打好政治仗。
    许多地方和单位的革命委员会、革筹小组和革命群众组织，还大办以落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示为内容的毛泽东思想学习班。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，也把落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，作为宣传的主要内容之一。
    目前，一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻、大落实毛主席“勤俭建国”、“要进一步节约闹革命”伟大指示的革命热潮，正在湖北各地蓬勃兴起。
