The people's armed forces and civilians in the provinces of Thua Thien, Kien Giang, and Tra Vinh in South Vietnam have, since March, built on the momentum of the New Year's victories and continued to advance boldly, achieving new victories by annihilating and demoralizing over 4,700 enemy troops.

In the Thua Thien Province, particularly in the Hue area, the local people's armed forces have been continuously attacking the enemy since early March. They have dealt heavy blows to the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and their puppet forces, which were sent to the area in an attempt to salvage the situation. According to incomplete statistics, in the first 22 days of March, the local forces and civilians have annihilated nearly 2,000 enemy troops, including over 1,300 American soldiers. They have also sunk five enemy warships, shot down ten enemy aircraft, destroyed three tanks, demolished six artillery pieces, burned down one fuel depot, and seized hundreds of various weapons.

In the battles on March 8th, 10th, 11th, and 13th, the people's armed forces in the Hue area annihilated over 800 enemy troops, almost all of whom were American invaders.

Over the past 20 days, the people's armed forces have launched widespread attacks around Hue City, not only foiling the enemy's "sweeping" operations but also continuously and fiercely assaulting the enemy's various bases, particularly the Tong Le Base, which houses the command center of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. The enemy has been caught off guard and suffered heavy losses.

In the first half of March, the people's armed forces and civilians in Kien Giang Province continued to attack the enemy's various towns, military command posts, outposts, and supply lines. They killed, wounded, and captured 1,030 enemy troops, including 320 American soldiers and 473 demoralized puppet soldiers. They also destroyed numerous warehouses, shot down six enemy aircraft, sank or damaged three enemy warships, and destroyed or damaged 17 military vehicles.

From March 3rd to 5th, the people's armed forces and civilians in Kien Giang Province launched successive attacks on the Vinh Te Town and the Tra Noc Airfield, annihilating nearly 500 enemy troops, including 180 American soldiers and South Korean mercenaries. They also shot down or destroyed five aircraft, sank two enemy ships, destroyed 14 military vehicles, and demolished many barracks and warehouses.

In the first half of March, the people's armed forces and civilians in Tra Vinh Province annihilated and demoralized 1,200 enemy troops, captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from 24 outposts and sentry posts, and liberated six communes and two towns with a population of over 50,000.

The soldiers of the people's armed forces in South Vietnam have bravely fought and dealt heavy blows to the American invaders.
