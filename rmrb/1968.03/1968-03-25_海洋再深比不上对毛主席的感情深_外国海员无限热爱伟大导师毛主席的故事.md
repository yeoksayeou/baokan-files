A Female Sailor's Heartfelt Words

On a Norwegian ship docked at a Chinese port, there was a female sailor who loved to sing a song based on Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." She sang this song not only in the morning and evening but also before meals. She sang it in English, Greek, and sometimes even in Chinese. Her singing was so powerful and inspiring.

One day, while we were on duty on the ship, we encountered this female sailor in the hallway. She was singing the song and staring at the Mao badge on our chests. We understood her intention and gave her a Mao badge.

The female sailor was overjoyed upon receiving the badge. She pressed it tightly to her chest and, with great enthusiasm, said, "Dear Chinese friends, please convey our heartfelt greetings to the great leader Chairman Mao. We Norwegian women and the Norwegian people think of him day and night."

Their Wish Fulfilled

One day, after completing a task on a Greek ship, an inspector was about to leave when an old sailor stopped him. The sailor warmly invited the inspector to his room and earnestly asked, "Dear Chinese comrade, can you give me a set of the Greek edition of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong'?"

The inspector noticed a set of English editions of the same book on the sailor's desk and asked, "You already have the English edition, why do you need the Greek edition?" The old sailor, seeing the inspector's confusion, smiled and explained, "My wife and daughter want it. They asked me to get it."

It turned out that the old sailor's wife also loved Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought deeply. She knew that Chairman Mao's books were not just for the Chinese people but for the people of the world. Chairman Mao's books were the guiding light for the oppressed people of the world to fight for liberation. Therefore, she eagerly wanted to read Chairman Mao's books. However, she did not understand English. Whenever the old sailor returned from abroad, she would ask him to explain Chairman Mao's works in Greek. She would then teach what she learned to her two daughters. But whenever the old sailor went on a long voyage, the mother and daughters could not continue their studies. Before this voyage to China, his wife and daughters repeatedly asked him to bring back a set of the Greek edition of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' so they could read Chairman Mao's books at any time.

The inspector was deeply moved by the old sailor's family's sincere love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The next morning, he rushed to the sailors' club and found a Greek edition of Chairman Mao's works for the old sailor. When the old sailor received the red book, he was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. He tightly grasped the inspector's hand and said excitedly, "Thank you, thank you! On behalf of my wife and daughters, I express our heartfelt gratitude to our dear Chinese friends!" He also happily said, "My wife and daughters love to read Chairman Mao's books. This time, their long-cherished wish to obtain the red book has finally been fulfilled!"

Let the Children Love Chairman Mao Too

One morning, while we were on duty on a Greek cargo ship, a six or seven-year-old boy suddenly entered the customs room where we were resting. He held a copy of "People's Pictorial" published in China in his left hand and raised his right hand high, standing tall and chanting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He walked up to us, greeted us politely in Chinese, and then sat down beside us, flipping through the "People's Pictorial." Whenever he saw Chairman Mao's picture, he would shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then he sang songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations and "The East Is Red," among others. He sang with increasing enthusiasm, and in the end, he mimicked the Red Guards' dance movements, repeatedly shouting, "Rebellion is justified! Rebellion is justified! Rebellion is justified!"

We were deeply attracted by the clever and lively boy's actions. Who was he? We later found out that he was the son of a female sailor. This female sailor loved Chairman Mao deeply. Not only did she love to read Chairman Mao's books and sing songs based on his quotations, but she also taught her child to read Chairman Mao's books and sing songs based on his quotations during her free time.

When we met her, we told her that we admired her for teaching her child to love Chairman Mao. She said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world's people. The world's people all love him! I not only love Chairman Mao myself, but I also want my child to love Chairman Mao. Let the children read the great teacher Chairman Mao's books from a young age, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and in the future, walk the path of China, the path guided by the great teacher Chairman Mao."

Two Greek Young Sailors

Two Greek young sailors visited China for the first time. After their ship docked, the first thing they did was to ask Chinese friends for "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao badges, and photographs. After receiving a finely made portrait of Chairman Mao, they felt immense happiness.

    海洋再深比不上对毛主席的感情深
    外国海员无限热爱伟大导师毛主席的故事
    一位女海员的心声
    在一艘停泊我国港口的挪威船上，有一位女海员，她最爱唱用毛主席语录谱成的歌曲：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    这支歌，她不仅早晨唱，晚上唱，而且吃饭前也要唱一遍；她不仅用英文唱，用希腊文唱，有时还用中文唱。她唱得那样雄壮，那样有力。
    一天，我们上船值勤，在走廊里碰上了这位女海员，她嘴里唱着这支歌，眼睛盯在我们胸前的毛主席像章上。我们明白了她的意思，就送给她一枚毛主席像章。
    这位女海员接过像章，高兴万分。她把像章紧紧贴在心窝上，热情洋溢地说：“中国朋友，请你们转告伟大导师毛主席，我们挪威妇女，挪威人民，日日夜夜想念着他老人家。”
        她们的愿望实现了
    一天，我检查员在一艘希腊船上执行任务完毕后，就要下船的时候，突然被一位老海员迎面拦住，热情地让到他的房间里去，十分恳切地说：“亲爱的中国同志，你能送给我一套希腊文版的《毛泽东选集》吗？”我检查员看到他的书桌上放着一套英文版的《毛泽东选集》，就问他：“你有了英文版的，为什么还要希腊文版的呢？”那位老海员看到我检查员不了解他的意思，就笑了笑解释说：“我妻子要，我女儿要，是她们让我要的。”接着，那位老海员就向我检查员介绍了他的妻子和女儿的情况。
    原来那位老海员的妻子也和他一样，非常热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。她知道，毛主席的书不但是为中国人民写的，而且也是为世界人民写的。毛主席的书，是指引世界被压迫人民争取解放的宝书。因此，她非常想读毛主席的书。可是她不懂英文，每当老海员从国外回去后，她都要老海员把毛主席著作用希腊语讲给她听。她从老海员那里学来后，再讲给她的两个女儿听。可是老海员一出国远航，她们母女三人就不能继续学习了。这次老海员临来中国前，他的妻子和女儿，一再要求他给她们带回一套希腊文版的《毛泽东选集》，以便她们随时都能直接读毛主席的书。
    我检查员听完这位老海员的介绍后，为他们全家人无限热爱毛主席、无限热爱毛泽东思想的真挚感情深深感动。第二天一早，就跑到海员俱乐部给老海员找到了希腊文版的毛主席著作。当老海员接到红彤彤的革命宝书后，感动得热泪盈眶，紧紧握住我检查员的手，万分激动地说：“谢谢，谢谢！我代表我的妻子和女儿，向亲爱的中国朋友致谢！”他并且十分高兴地说：“我的妻子和女儿最爱读毛主席的书。这回，她们日夜渴望得到红宝书的心愿终于实现了！”
        让孩子也热爱毛主席
    一天上午，我们在一艘希腊货轮上执行任务。当我们在海关房间里休息时，突然进来一个六七岁的小男孩，他左手抱着一本我国出版的《人民画报》，右手高高举起，挺着胸脯，一边走一边高呼“毛主席万岁！”走到我们跟前，恭恭敬敬地用中国话向我们问好，而后，乖乖地坐在我们身边，翻看《人民画报》。他见到画报上的毛主席像就高呼：“毛主席万岁！”然后又给我们唱毛主席语录歌和《大海航行靠舵手》、《在北京的金山上》等歌曲。他越唱越有劲，最后，他还模仿红卫兵舞蹈的动作，嘴里不断地喊着：“造反有理！造反有理！造反有理！”
    我们被这个聪明伶俐的小男孩的举动深深吸引住了。他是谁的小孩呢？经过了解才知道，原来他是一个女海员的孩子。这位女海员非常热爱毛主席。她不但自己爱读毛主席的书，爱唱毛主席语录歌，而且在工作之余，还教她的孩子读毛主席的书，唱毛主席语录歌。
    当我们遇到她的时候，对她说，我们对她教育自己的孩子热爱毛主席非常敬佩。她说：“毛主席是世界人民的伟大导师，世界人民都热爱他！我不仅自己热爱毛主席，而且让孩子也热爱毛主席。让孩子们从小就读伟大导师毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，将来走中国的路，走伟大导师毛主席指引的路。”
