The great teacher and the resplendent thought
Revolutionary peoples of all countries deeply love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought
Revolutionary peoples of the world yearn for Beijing

“Comrade, hello!” Suddenly, a warm greeting came from behind me. I turned around to see two African friends, both wearing Mao Chairman badges that shimmered with gold. Their smiling and excited faces seemed to have a thousand words to express.

Before I could speak, one of them took my hand and said with deep emotion, “We are about to leave China. China is so good! I felt like I was with my mother here. Wherever we went in your country, people left us with the best and most unforgettable impressions. The Chinese people’s revolutionary spirit is something we should learn from, and their warm hospitality makes us feel very close to them.” Looking at his sincere expression, I said excitedly, “We warmly welcome you to visit China again. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong backbone of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world.” They immediately raised their thumbs and said happily, “Good! Good! Thank you! We will definitely come to Beijing again.” Saying this, they tightly held my hand and said passionately, “We yearn for Beijing. Revolutionary peoples of the whole world yearn for Beijing. Beijing has a Mao Zedong! Mao—Ze—Dong!”

The name “Mao Zedong” was spoken so loudly and firmly. The brief words expressed the African revolutionary peoples’ boundless love, faith, and admiration for our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao.

He then sang “The East Is Red” in Chinese, singing it over and over again, rhythmically waving the Little Red Book in front of his chest.

The train slowly moved, and many international friends, with deep reluctance to leave China, stuck their heads out of the windows, holding up red copies of “Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,” waving them vigorously to bid farewell to the staff.

The train gradually left the station, but the passionate and resonant song “The East Is Red” could still be heard echoing in the air.

We love Mao Zedong very much

In the crisp autumn air, a train full of international friends slowly pulled into our border station. I was on duty on the train. Two Polish passengers warmly invited me to their room and then earnestly said, “Comrade, please give us your Mao Chairman badge. You know, we love him very much—Mao Zedong!”

The border guards understand the feelings of the revolutionary peoples of the world who love the great leader Chairman Mao. They quickly took off their beloved Mao Chairman badges and quotations badges and pinned them neatly on the chests of the two. The two happily shook my hand and said, “Thank you! Thank you! This is the most precious gift given to us by Chinese comrades.” After saying this, they looked at each other’s badges on their chests and suddenly shouted in unison, “I still need one!” One quickly said, “I need a Mao Chairman badge. With this badge, I can see Chairman Mao—the great teacher of the revolutionary peoples of the world—every day.” The other also eagerly said, “I need a quotations badge. Chairman Mao’s words are the truth!”

I fulfilled their request. When they both had a set of shining Mao Chairman badges and quotations badges on their chests, they were overjoyed, dancing and jumping, their faces filled with boundless pride and happiness, shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!”

We must master Mao Zedong Thought

This incident happened on an outbound freight train. I was holding a red copy of “Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,” gazing at the portrait of our great teacher Chairman Mao on the cover, when an elderly Soviet worker came over. As soon as he saw me, he excitedly pointed at the solemn and benevolent portrait of Chairman Mao, saying with reverence, “Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage.”

This elderly Soviet Red Army veteran, who had participated in the anti-German fascist war, pointed at the red Little Red Book and said passionately, “This is a true work of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. His works are the universal truth.” He then said firmly and powerfully, “We must master Mao Zedong Thought.” Manzhouli Border Inspection Station Reporting Group

    伟大的导师  光辉的思想
    各国革命人民无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    世界革命人民向往北京
    “同志，您好！”突然从我身后传来亲切的问好，回头一看是两位非洲朋友，胸前都佩戴着毛主席像章，金光闪闪，那微笑而激动的脸上仿佛有千言万语要倾吐。
    不等我开口，其中的一位一下握住我的手，满怀深情地向我说：“我们就要离开中国了，中国真好啊！……我在中国就象在妈妈身边一样，我们到你们的任何一个地方，人们都给我们留下极好的、永远难忘的印象。中国人民饱满的革命精神值得我们学习，热情好客的态度使我们感到十分亲切。”我看着他那真挚的神情，激动地说：“我们热烈欢迎你们再次来中国作客，七亿中国人民是亚非拉和全世界革命人民的坚强后盾。”他们立刻翘起大拇指高兴地连声说：“好！好！谢谢！我们一定会再次来北京。”说着紧紧地握着我的手，满怀激情地说：“我们向往着北京，全世界革命人民向往着北京，北京有个毛泽东！毛—泽—东！”
      “毛泽东”这几个字说得那样宏亮，有力，简短的语言表达了非洲革命人民对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。
    他接着又用中文唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》，唱了一遍又一遍，红色宝书在胸前有节奏地挥动着。
    列车慢慢移动了，许多国际友人都怀着对中国的极大留恋，从车窗伸出头，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，使劲地挥动着，向我工作人员告别。
    火车逐渐离站了，但还听得见“大海航行靠舵手，……干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”的激昂嘹亮的歌声在空中回响。
          我们非常热爱毛泽东
    秋高气爽，一列满载着国际友人的列车慢慢驶进我边境车站。我正在车上执勤，有两位波兰旅客，热情地把我请到他们房间，然后恳切地对我说：“好同志，把你的毛主席像章给我们吧，要知道我们非常热爱他——毛泽东！”
    我们边防战士最理解世界革命人民热爱伟大领袖毛主席的心情，连忙摘下自己心爱的毛主席像章和语录章分别端端正正地佩戴在他俩胸前。他俩高兴地握着我的手说：“谢谢！谢谢！这是中国同志赠给我们最珍贵的礼物。”说完满意地互相看了看胸前的像章，突然他俩同时喊了起来：“我还少一枚！”一位抢先说：“我少毛主席像章，你一定给我一个，好吗？戴着这像章，我就能天天见到毛主席——世界革命人民的伟大导师。”另一位也急着说：“我少了语录章，毛主席的话是真理！”
    我满足了他们的要求。当他们胸前都别上一套金光闪闪的毛主席像章和语录章时，乐的手舞足蹈，脸上立刻堆起了无限骄傲和幸福的笑容，连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
            一定要掌握毛泽东思想
    这事发生在一列出境货车上，我正手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》凝望着扉页上我们伟大导师毛主席像时，过来了一位苏联老工人，一见面他就兴奋地指着庄严慈祥的毛主席像，怀着崇敬的心情说道：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
    这位曾经参加过反德国法西斯战争的苏联老红军战士，指着红彤彤的宝书，热情地说：“这是真正的马克思列宁主义的著作，毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他的著作是放之四海而皆准的真理。”说到这里，他坚定而有力地说：“我们一定要掌握毛泽东思想。”满洲里边防检查站报道组
