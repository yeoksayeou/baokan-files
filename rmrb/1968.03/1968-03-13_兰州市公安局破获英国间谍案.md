All class enemies cannot escape the mighty grasp of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Lanzhou Public Security Bureau has recently uncovered a case of British spies operating in the People's Republic of China.

The criminal George Watt, under the guise of an engineer, used spy tactics to steal important military, political, economic, and Cultural Revolution intelligence from our country. He also took numerous photographs of restricted areas, seriously endangering our country's security and sabotaging our socialist construction. His crimes are heinous. It was also discovered that Peter Dickart was engaged in spy activities in our country. Revolutionary masses unanimously demand severe punishment.

New China News Agency, Lanzhou, March 12th - The Lanzhou Public Security Bureau of Gansu Province, based on reports from revolutionary masses, recently uncovered a case of British spy George Watt (British) conducting espionage activities in the People's Republic of China.

George Watt arrived in China on December 14, 1966, under the guise of an engineer from the British "Vickers-Gimma Company." Before coming to China, he received instructions from the head of the "Vickers-Gimma Company" and British imperialist spy Jay to steal intelligence. After arriving in China, he used his engineering cover to engage in espionage activities aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China, actively serving British imperialist aggression policies. During his time in China, George Watt used spy tactics to steal important military, political, economic, and Cultural Revolution intelligence from our country. He also took numerous photographs of restricted areas, seriously endangering our country's security and sabotaging our socialist construction. His crimes are heinous.

While uncovering George Watt's spy case, the Lanzhou Public Security Bureau also discovered that Peter Dickart, an engineer from the British "Vickers-Gimma Company" (West German), was also engaged in spy activities in our country.

"Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until annihilation—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." Despite the British imperialist intelligence agencies using the British "Vickers-Gimma Company" as a cover for trade, sending spies, and engaging in economic and technological fraud to sabotage our socialist construction, their criminal activities have finally been exposed in broad daylight. Despite their cunning methods of espionage, they cannot escape the mighty grasp of the Chinese people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and remain highly vigilant.

The crimes of George Watt and Peter Dickart in conducting espionage activities have aroused the extreme indignation of the revolutionary masses. Revolutionary masses unanimously demand severe punishment for the British spies.

　　兰州市公安局破获英国间谍案
    罪犯乔治·瓦特，以工程师的身份，用特务手段窃取了我国的军事、政治、经济和无产阶级文化大革命等重要情报，大量偷摄我国禁区照片，严重地危害我国的安全，破坏我国的社会主义建设，罪恶重大。同时发现彼德·迪卡特也在我国从事间谍情报活动。革命群众一致要求给予严厉惩处。
    新华社兰州十二日电　甘肃省兰州市公安局，根据革命群众检举，最近破获了英国间谍乔治·瓦特（英国人）在中华人民共和国进行间谍活动的案件。
    乔治·瓦特于一九六六年十二月十四日以英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”工程师的身份来到中国。他在来中国以前，接受了“维克斯—吉玛公司”负责人、英帝国主义间谍分子杰伊布置的窃取情报的任务；来中国以后以工程师身份为掩护，进行旨在反对中华人民共和国的间谍活动，积极为英帝国主义的侵略政策效劳。乔治·瓦特在中国期间，以特务手段窃取了我国的军事、政治、经济和无产阶级文化大革命等重要情报，大量偷摄我国禁区照片，严重地危害我国的安全，破坏我国的社会主义建设，罪恶重大。
    兰州市公安局在破获乔治·瓦特间谍案的同时，还发现英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”工程师彼德·迪卡特（西德人）也在我国从事间谍情报活动。
      “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”尽管英帝国主义情报机关通过英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”，以贸易为掩护，派遣间谍，该公司并在经济技术上进行诈骗，破坏我国社会主义建设，但其罪恶活动终于暴露在光天化日之下。尽管他们进行间谍活动的手段十分狡猾，但他们终于逃不脱用毛泽东思想武装起来的时刻保持高度革命警惕的中国人民的巨掌。
    乔治·瓦特和彼德·迪卡特进行间谍活动的罪行，激起了广大革命群众的无比愤慨。革命群众一致要求给予英国间谍分子严厉惩处。
