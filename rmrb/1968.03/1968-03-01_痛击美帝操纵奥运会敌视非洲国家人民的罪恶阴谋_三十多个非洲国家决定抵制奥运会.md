More than thirty African countries decide to boycott the Olympics

Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, February 28th - The Supreme Council for Sports in Africa, with over thirty African countries in attendance, decided on the 26th to boycott the 19th Olympic Games scheduled to be held in Mexico in October. This decision is in protest against the International Olympic Committee, which, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, has shown hostility towards the African people by illegally allowing South Africa, which practices racial discrimination, to participate in the Olympics.

The Supreme Council for Sports in Africa made this collective decision to boycott the Olympics in Mexico during a special meeting of its executive committee held here.

The decision by the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa to collectively boycott the Olympics in Mexico is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist plot to sabotage the struggle of African nations against South African racism. The scheme to force South Africa into the Olympics was orchestrated by Avery Brundage, the American chairman of the International Olympic Committee. Under Brundage's manipulation, the IOC illegally decided on February 15th to allow South Africa to participate in the Olympics. To carry out this scheme, Brundage, this U.S. imperialist, had previously arranged for the South African white racist regime to form a so-called "mixed-race" sports team, including athletes of color, attempting to cover up its crimes of brutally persecuting people of color at home and to deceive African and global public opinion.

However, the U.S. imperialist plot was met with a strong rebuke from African countries as soon as it was revealed.

Before the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa made the decision to collectively boycott, many African countries, including Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Tanzania, Guinea, Algeria, the United Arab Republic, and Uganda, had already announced their boycott of the Olympics that included South Africa. Syria, an Asian country, formally announced its boycott of the Olympics on the 20th to show support for African countries. The Ministerial Council of the Organization of African Unity, which concluded on the 24th in Addis Ababa, also passed a resolution to boycott the 19th Olympic Games.

The chairman of the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa, Anicet Onana, stated at a press conference that the decision by the IOC to allow South Africa to participate in the Olympics is an "unprecedented disgrace."

The special meeting of the executive committee of the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa also discussed the issue of the second African Games scheduled to be held in Bamako in October 1969.

### 痛击美帝操纵奥运会敌视非洲国家人民的罪恶阴谋  三十多个非洲国家决定抵制奥运会

    痛击美帝操纵奥运会敌视非洲国家人民的罪恶阴谋
    三十多个非洲国家决定抵制奥运会
    新华社布拉柴维尔二十八日电　有三十多个非洲国家参加的非洲体育运动最高委员会，二十六日决定抵制今年十月在墨西哥举行的第十九届奥林匹克运动会，以抗议在美帝国主义操纵下的国际奥林匹克委员会敌视非洲国家人民，非法决定让实行种族歧视政策的南非参加这届奥运会。
    非洲体育运动最高委员会的这一决定是这个委员会的执行局在这里举行的特别会议上作出的。
    非洲体育运动最高委员会作出集体抵制将在墨西哥举行的奥运会的决定，是对美帝国主义破坏非洲国家反对南非种族主义的斗争的阴谋的一个沉重打击。硬把南非塞进奥运会的阴谋是由国际奥林匹克委员会的美国人主席布伦戴奇一手策划的。在布伦戴奇的操纵下，国际奥委会在二月十五日非法决定同意南非参加奥运会。为了实现这个阴谋，布伦戴奇这个美帝国主义分子事先曾让南非白人种族主义当局搞了一个所谓“种族混合”体育代表队，让有色人种运动员参加，企图以此掩盖它在国内疯狂迫害有色人种的罪行，欺骗非洲和全世界舆论。
    但是，美帝国主义的阴谋诡计刚一出笼，就遭到非洲国家的迎头痛击。
    在非洲体育运动最高委员会作出集体抵制的决定之前，已有许多非洲国家，包括马里、刚果（布）、坦桑尼亚、几内亚、阿尔及利亚、阿联、乌干达等，相继宣布抵制让南非参加的奥运会。亚洲国家叙利亚在二十日正式宣布抵制奥运会，以示对非洲国家的支持。二十四日在亚的斯亚贝巴闭幕的非洲统一组织部长理事会也作出了抵制第十九届奥运会的决议。
    非洲体育运动最高委员会主席安·翁贝萨在一次记者招待会上指出，国际奥委会让南非参加奥运会的这一决定是一件“空前的丑事”。
    这次非洲体育运动最高委员会执行局特别会议还讨论了预定于一九六九年十月在巴马科举行的第二届非洲运动会问题。
