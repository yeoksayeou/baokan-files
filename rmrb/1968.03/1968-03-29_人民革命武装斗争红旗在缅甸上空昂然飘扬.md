The Great Victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought
The Great Victory of a Long and Arduous Revolutionary War
The Red Flag of People's Revolutionary Armed Struggle Flies Proudly in the Sky of Burma

The armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has adhered to the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power." It has become a shining banner for the revolution of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, our correspondent reports: The heroic Burmese Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has led the Burmese people in a 20-year-long, arduous armed struggle. They have achieved a great situation, becoming a shining banner for the revolution of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

Over the past 20 years, the Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Ba Tin, has adhered to the revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. Through long-term struggle and testing, it has become the strong leadership core of the revolutionary cause of all ethnic groups in Burma. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this people's war has severely struck the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in Burma, continuously developing and expanding the people's revolutionary forces. Today, the people's armed bases and guerrilla zones led by the Burmese Communist Party are spread across the eastern, southern, western, and northern regions of Burma. The people's armed forces are active in the densely forested regions of Pegu and Arakan, galloping in the rice-producing Irrawaddy Delta, the northwestern regions, and the coastal areas of the south. They flexibly and swiftly eliminate the enemy, forming a surrounding situation against the enemy-occupied towns and transportation routes.

The brilliant victories of the Burmese people's armed struggle are the result of the Burmese Communist Party combining the great Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of Burma. It is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The fundamental reason for the victory and progress of the Burmese revolutionary cause is to highlight the proletarian political line and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. On March 28, 1948, when the Burmese reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, the Burmese Communist Party began to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and take the revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. At that time, Comrade Ba Tin called on the entire party to study "Mao Zedong's theories." Comrade Ba Tin led the Burmese Communist Party in the process of persisting in armed struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to wage an irreconcilable struggle against international Soviet modern revisionism and the Chinese Khrushchev clique, as well as the "left" and "right" opportunism within the party. In 1964, the Burmese Communist Party, based on Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," formulated the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power." It is this correct line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought that has greatly promoted the Burmese revolutionary cause, making armed struggle enter a new situation of rapid development.

Since 1964, the Burmese Communist Party has launched an unprecedented campaign to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought throughout the party and the army. In the base areas, they also carried out rectification movements, using criticism and self-criticism to study Mao Zedong Thought. In 1967, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party passed a resolution, solemnly declaring: "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism and communism are heading towards global victory. We must clearly accept that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of Marxism-Leninism of our era." "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma, and especially Mao Zedong's theories on building a proletarian party, building a proletarian army, and people's war are the beacon for the victory of the Burmese revolution." That year, the Propaganda Department of the Burmese Communist Party also translated and published Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles," as a weapon for the entire party members and revolutionary fighters to educate themselves and promote thought revolutionization. They also launched a widespread campaign to criticize the black "Self-Cultivation."

The Burmese Communist Party strives to build the people's armed forces into a revolutionary and highly politically conscious people's army according to Chairman Mao's military thought. The Burmese Communist Party firmly implements the principle of "the party commands the gun, and the gun must not command the party" in the people's armed forces. The Burmese Communist Party uses Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts on people's war to educate the people's armed fighters, criticizing the influence of the bourgeois military line.

The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." Since 1948, when the Burmese Communist Party began armed struggle, most party members and cadres moved from the cities to the countryside where the ruling class's forces were relatively weak, mobilizing and organizing the peasant masses, accumulating revolutionary forces, and "turning backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated base areas." The Burmese Communist Party implemented the class policy of "relying on poor and hired peasants, firmly uniting middle peasants, neutralizing rich peasants, and concentrating on striking landlords" in the countryside. Especially since 1964, the Burmese Communist Party has more vigorously mobilized the masses, launching a vigorous struggle to demand higher rice purchase prices and resist compulsory purchases in the vast countryside, and launching struggles to eliminate traitors and local tyrants. Last year, they also led the urban and rural masses to launch a large-scale struggle against hunger. In these struggles, the Burmese Communist Party established party organizations in various places, developed various mass organizations, armed the masses, and established local people's governments.

Chairman of the Burmese Communist Party, Comrade Ba Tin, said: "In the revolutionary base areas, the masses have two tasks: directly participating in the revolutionary armed forces or joining the militia. Those who can leave their jobs join the revolutionary armed forces, and those who cannot leave their jobs join the militia. In our base areas, militias have now been universally established, which shows how solid our revolutionary base areas are." More than 90% of the Burmese people's armed forces are sons of peasants. The broad support of the peasant masses is the force that ensures the people's armed forces are invincible, enabling the revolutionary war to be sustained and continuously developed.

The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Our policy should be based on what? It should be based on our own strength, which is self-reliance. We are not isolated; all countries and peoples in the world that oppose imperialism are our friends. But we emphasize self-reliance." In the long-term revolutionary armed struggle, the Burmese Communist Party relies on the strength of the people, firmly implementing the policy of self-reliance. The Burmese people's armed forces have long put forward the magnificent slogan of "exchanging spears for rifles." Comrade Ba Tin once pointed out, based on the experience of the long-term armed struggle of the Burmese revolutionary people: "Against the enemy's attacks, there is no need to be afraid and run away. We should see that this is an opportunity to strengthen our forces. The enemy army is our supply department." In the long-term revolutionary war, the Burmese people's armed forces have armed themselves with the enemy's weapons. The weapons and ammunition the Burmese people's armed forces use today to strike the enemy are all seized from the enemy. Due to the implementation of the policy of self-reliance, the Burmese Communist Party can fully rely on the creativity of all military and civilian personnel to sustain long-term revolutionary war.

The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle issue." Burma is a multi-ethnic country. Imperialism and the Burmese reactionaries ruthlessly oppress and exploit various ethnic minorities. They are the common enemies of all ethnic groups in Burma. For many years, various ethnic minorities in Burma have been forced to take up arms to fight against the Burmese reactionary government. The Burmese Communist Party implements a correct national policy, establishing a united front against American imperialism and the Burmese reactionary government with various progressive ethnic minority armed forces on the common political basis of national democratic revolution. As early as 1959, the Burmese Communist Party formed the National Democratic United Front with the Karen National Union, New Mon State Party, Kayah National Progressive Party, and Chin National Council. The Burmese Communist Party also actively promotes cooperation with other national progressive armed forces. This has smashed the plot of the U.S. and the Burmese reactionary government to divide the unity between the Burmese Communist Party and various progressive ethnic minority armed forces, enabling the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party to fight side by side with various ethnic minority armed forces, fiercely striking the reactionary rule of the U.S. and the Burmese reactionaries.

The great leader Mao said: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to gain power." Over the past 20 years, the Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Ba Tin, has held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learning revolution in revolution and learning war in war, accumulating rich experience, and opening up a bright path for the victory of the Burmese national democratic revolution. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Burmese Communist Party will surely further unite the entire party and all ethnic groups in Burma, overcome various difficulties on the road ahead, and, through long-term struggle, achieve a thorough victory in the revolutionary war.

    马列主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　艰苦卓绝长期革命战争的伟大胜利
    人民革命武装斗争红旗在缅甸上空昂然飘扬
    缅共领导的革命武装斗争，以马列主义、毛泽东思想为武器，坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命路线，成为殖民地半殖民地人民革命的一面光辉旗帜
    据新华社二十七日讯　本社记者报道：英勇的缅甸共产党高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，领导缅甸人民进行了二十年艰苦卓绝的武装斗争，打出了一片大好形势，从而成为殖民地、半殖民地人民革命的一面光辉旗帜。
    二十年来，以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，坚持农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路，经过长期斗争的锻炼和考验，已成为缅甸各族人民革命事业坚强的领导核心。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下进行的这场人民战争，狠狠地打击了帝国主义及其走狗在缅甸的反动统治，不断发展和壮大了人民革命力量。今天，缅甸共产党领导的人民武装根据地和游击区，已遍布缅甸东南西北各个部域。人民武装部队，活跃在森林密布的勃固和亚拉干山区，驰骋在盛产稻米的伊洛瓦底江三角洲、西北地区和南部沿海地带，机动灵活地消灭敌人，对敌占城镇和交通要道形成了包围形势。
    缅甸人民革命武装斗争的光辉胜利，是缅甸共产党把伟大的毛泽东思想和缅甸的革命实际相结合的结果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，这是缅甸革命事业胜利前进的根本。一九四八年三月二十八日，缅甸反动派发动反革命内战的时候，缅甸共产党就按照毛主席的教导，开始走上农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的革命道路。当时，德钦丹东同志就号召全党，学习“毛泽东的理论”。德钦丹东同志领导缅甸共产党，在坚持武装斗争过程中，以毛泽东思想为武器，同国际上的苏联现代修正主义和中国赫鲁晓夫之流以及党内“左”右倾机会主义进行了不调和的斗争。一九六四年，缅甸共产党根据毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，制定了“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命路线。正是这条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确路线，大大推进了缅甸革命事业，使武装斗争出现了迅速发展的新局面。
    从一九六四年以来，缅甸共产党在全党全军掀起了一个规模空前的大学大用毛泽东思想的高潮。在根据地，还开展了整风运动，通过批评和自我批评的办法，来学习毛泽东思想。一九六七年，缅甸共产党中央政治局通过决议，庄严宣布：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义、共产主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，必须明确地接受毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”“毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针，特别是毛泽东同志关于建设无产阶级政党、建设无产阶级军队和人民战争的理论，更是缅甸革命取得胜利的指路明灯。”这一年，缅共中央宣传部还翻译和出版了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，作为全体党员和革命战士进行自我教育和促进思想革命化的武器，并且发动广大党员和战士狠批黑《修养》。
    缅甸共产党努力按照毛主席的军事思想，从各方面把人民武装建设成为一支革命化的、有高度政治觉悟的人民军队。缅甸共产党对人民武装坚决贯彻“党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”的原则。缅甸共产党用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术教育人民武装战士，批判资产阶级军事路线的影响。
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”缅甸共产党从一九四八年开始武装斗争起，大多数党员和干部就从城市转移到统治阶级力量比较薄弱的农村地区，发动和组织农民群众，积聚革命力量，“把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地”。缅甸共产党在农村中执行了“依靠贫雇农，牢固地团结中农，中立富农，集中打击地主”的阶级政策。特别是一九六四年以来，缅甸共产党更加放手地发动群众，在广大农村中开展轰轰烈烈地要求提高大米收购价格和抗征购的斗争，开展锄奸反霸斗争。去年又领导城乡广大人民开展了大规模的反饥饿斗争。在这些斗争中，缅甸共产党在各地建立了党的组织，发展了各种群众组织，武装了群众，建立了基层人民政权。
    缅甸共产党主席德钦丹东同志说：“在革命根据地里，群众有两个任务，直接参加革命武装部队，或参加民兵。能够脱产的人参加革命武装部队，不能脱产的就参加民兵。在我们的根据地里，现在已经普遍建立民兵，它表明我们的革命根据地是何等巩固。”缅甸人民武装百分之九十以上的战士都是农民子弟。广大农民群众的支持，是使人民武装立于不败之地，是革命战争能够持久进行，并且不断发展的力量源泉。
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。我们并不孤立，全世界一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生”。缅甸共产党在长期的革命武装斗争中，依靠人民群众的力量，坚决执行自力更生的方针。缅甸人民武装很早就提出了“用梭标换步枪”的豪迈口号。德钦丹东同志曾经根据缅甸革命人民长期武装斗争的经验指出：“对于敌人的进攻，用不着害怕和逃跑，应当看到，这是壮大我们力量的机会，敌军是我们的供应部。”在长期的革命战争中，缅甸人民武装用敌人的武器武装了自己。缅甸人民武装今天用来打击敌人的武器和弹药，都是从敌人手里夺过来的。由于实行自力更生的方针，缅甸共产党能够充分地依靠全体军民的创造力，坚持长期的革命战争。
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”缅甸是一个多民族的国家。帝国主义和缅甸反动派，残酷地压迫和剥削各少数民族。它们是缅甸各族人民的共同敌人。多年以来，缅甸各少数民族被迫拿起武器，进行反对缅甸反动政府的斗争。缅甸共产党实行正确的民族政策，在民族民主革命的共同政治基础上，同国内各个进步的少数民族武装建立了反对美帝国主义和缅甸反动政府的统一战线。早在一九五九年，缅甸共产党同克伦民族团结党、新孟邦党、克耶民族进步党、钦族最高委员会组成了民族民主团结阵线。缅甸共产党还积极促进同其他民族的进步武装的合作关系。这就粉碎了美帝和缅甸反动政府妄图分化缅甸共产党同各个进步的少数民族武装的团结的阴谋，使缅甸共产党领导的人民武装同各少数民族武装能够并肩战斗，猛烈打击着美帝和缅甸反动派的反动统治。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”二十年来，以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命中学习革命，在战争中学习战争，积累了丰富的经验，为缅甸民族民主革命的胜利开辟了一条光明大道。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，缅甸共产党一定能够进一步团结全党和缅甸各族人民，克服前进道路上的各种困难，经过长期斗争，夺取革命战争的彻底胜利。
