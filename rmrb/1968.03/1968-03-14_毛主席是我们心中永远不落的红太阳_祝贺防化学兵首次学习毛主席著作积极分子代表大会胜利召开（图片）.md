Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in our hearts – congratulating the successful convening of the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works among chemical defense troops

The medical team of a certain unit of the chemical defense troops, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, closely connects with the masses and wholeheartedly serves the people. They often take "The Three Articles" as their motto, take Comrade White as their example, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, reform their worldview, and vow to be white-clad warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. This is the medical team's comrades propagating knowledge about preventing diseases in the countryside.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. A certain company of the chemical defense troops, under any circumstances, takes studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental principle of building the company, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to arm the soldiers' minds, and is determined to turn the company into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Ding Xiuzhen, a research intern of a certain unit of the chemical defense troops, follows Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely takes the path of integrating with workers and peasants, humbly learns from the masses of workers and peasants, and strives to reform her worldview. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she stood firm, held high the banner, and resolutely fought against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is Comrade Ding Xiuzhen (front left) and poor and lower-middle peasants working together in the fields.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the revolutionary faction of the chemical defense troops' headquarters, in the leftist work in Cuicun People's Commune, Changping County, Beijing, takes Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, holds extensive, detailed, and arduous political and ideological work classes on Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the commune. This is the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the revolutionary teachers of the commune's primary school discussing their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Zhang Yongchang, a political officer of a certain unit of the chemical defense troops, has persistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works for over a decade. In the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" work, he is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and has done new deeds for the people. This is Comrade Zhang Yongchang (second from the left) writing big-character posters with representatives, criticizing the revisionist party-building line of Liu Shaoqi.

The military training team of a certain unit of the chemical defense troops stationed in Beijing No. 117 Middle School, following Chairman Mao's teachings, vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought during military training and adheres to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. With the help of the military training team, the school insists on resuming classes and making revolution, achieves revolutionary great unity, and establishes a revolutionary committee. This is the comrades of the military training team studying Chairman Mao's works with revolutionary teachers and students.

The leftist workers of a certain unit of the chemical defense troops in the Beijing Telephone Bureau, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "Criticize Revisionism and Repudiate Self" as the guideline, hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the bureau, with revolution and production presenting a great situation. This is the leftist workers and members of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary workers studying how to further implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production."
