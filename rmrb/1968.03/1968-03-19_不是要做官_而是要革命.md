Title: Not to Seek Official Positions but to Make Revolution

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking official positions, but are making revolution. We must all have a thorough spirit of revolution, and we must never for a moment part company with the masses."

The establishment of the revolutionary committees is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads continues to manifest in new forms, and the arduous revolutionary journey lies ahead. The revolutionary committees must be fortified with Mao Zedong Thought and become a strong command center for carrying the revolution through to the end and promoting production.

How can we consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees and crush the counterattacks and offensives of the class enemies?

Chairman Mao says: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them as one, then we can overcome any difficulty and defeat any enemy. Only then will the enemy be defeated by us."

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels, if they want to make revolution, must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and unite with them as one, and be willing to be the pupils of the masses. If they seek official positions, they will inevitably look down upon the masses, put on airs, and stand above the masses, thus becoming estranged from them. Therefore, how to treat the masses, whether to maintain close ties with them, is not a mere question of ideological style, but a fundamental question of standpoint, a question of whether to make revolution or not, and a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The class enemies fear most that our cadres and the masses breathe the same air, share the same destiny, unite as one, and fight together. The class enemies' point of attack in disrupting the relations between cadres and the masses is to take advantage of our cadres' arrogance and complacency. If the members of the revolutionary committees become arrogant and complacent because of victory, regarding themselves as heroes, they will inevitably become estranged from the masses, providing the class enemies with opportunities to exploit. This must be guarded against.

The revolutionary committee of Yīchūn City, in stressing the thoroughgoing revolutionization of the leading cadres, emphasizes "guarding against arrogance and preventing change" and correctly treating the masses. Their approach is worthy of attention. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly carried forward Chairman Mao's advocacy of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and maintaining close ties with them. If we continue to uphold and carry forward this fine tradition, our newly established revolutionary committees will be even more vigorous and invincible.

　　不是要做官　而是要革命
　　本报评论员
    伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”
    革命委员会成立，只是万里长征走完了第一步。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争仍然在以新的形式表现出来，艰苦的革命途程还在后面。革命委员会应当是用毛泽东思想武装起来的、抓革命促生产的坚强的指挥部。
    怎么样才能巩固新生的革命委员会，粉碎阶级敌人的反扑和进攻呢？
    毛主席说：“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”
    各级革命委员会的成员，要革命，就必须牢记毛主席的教导，永远相信群众，依靠群众，和群众打成一片，甘当群众的小学生。如果想当官，就必然看不起群众，摆官架子，高踞于群众之上，脱离群众。因此，如何对待群众，是否密切联系群众，这不是一般的思想作风问题，而是根本立场问题，是要不要革命的问题，是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的问题。
    阶级敌人最害怕的，就是我们的干部和群众同呼吸，共命运，团结在一起，战斗在一起。阶级敌人破坏干群关系的一个突破口，就是利用我们干部的骄傲自满情绪。革命委员会的成员，如果因为胜利滋长了骄傲情绪、以功臣自居，就必然会使自己脱离群众，给阶级敌人以可乘之隙。这一点，必须十分警惕。
    伊春市革命委员会在狠抓领导班子思想革命化时，强调“戒骄防变”，正确对待群众。他们的作法值得重视。无产阶级文化大革命，极大地发扬了毛主席倡导的信任群众，依靠群众，密切联系群众的优良传统。继续保持和发扬这个传统，我们新生的革命委员会就将会更加朝气蓬勃，无往而不胜。
