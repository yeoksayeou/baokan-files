Editor's Note: Half of the standing committee members of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee, along with half of the staff, have gone deep into the grassroots units in factories, mines, and rural areas to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This is a major revolutionary measure.

The vast majority of workers and peasants are at the grassroots level, and most cadres are also at the grassroots level. Whether or not to focus on grassroots work is a major issue of whether or not to follow the mass line, whether or not to firmly establish the foundation of the newly born revolutionary committees, and whether or not to turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the actions of millions of people. Therefore, the revolutionary committees should focus their main efforts on the grassroots level, do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work among the masses, and not float above, detach from the masses, detach from reality, and become a "paper command."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To turn the Party's line into the line of the masses, we must persist in a long-term, unyielding, arduous, and patient effort that is not afraid of trouble. Without such effort, nothing will succeed." We must insist on going to the grassroots, going to the masses, and make unyielding efforts to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 29th: Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee took a revolutionary measure to send half of the office staff to grassroots units. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they are earnestly and thoroughly implementing and fully implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the masses, and promoting the current work in all aspects.

In January of this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting. All participants, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, revised the originally formulated "Regulations for Achieving Revolutionization of the Organs." After the meeting, all committee members immediately took action. Half of the standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee led a large number of staff from the Revolutionary Committee to go deep into the grassroots units in rural production teams and industrial and mining enterprises. Before going down, the staff of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee discussed the topic "What to grasp when going down? How to grasp it?" Everyone unanimously expressed that when going to the grassroots level, they would firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's instructions. No matter how many tasks there are, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the most important one. There are countless tasks at the grassroots level, and working with the broad revolutionary masses to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the fundamental way to do all the work well. The main grain-producing area of Heilongjiang Province, Nenjiang Prefecture, had a bumper harvest in agriculture last year. Some production teams' members became complacent and did not pay enough attention to the preparation work for this spring's farming. The staff who went to the countryside with the Provincial Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the team members, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism together, and used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to summarize last year's production experience and inspect this year's preparation work. Some production brigades that suffered from natural disasters last year reviewed how they overcame the disasters and increased production by relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for an even greater harvest this year. For example, in Taiping Brigade, Gannan County, a heavy hailstorm destroyed 70% of the crops in June last year. The broad masses of community members, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," united as one, overcame the disaster, replanted the damaged farmland, and not only did not reduce production but also sold over 40 million jin of grain to the state. The community members in this area inspected the slackness in the current preparation work, tightened the preparation for farming. For the farmland that was originally considered to have enough base fertilizer and did not need to add more, they sent manure. Some production brigades with large mechanized farming areas originally thought that mechanized farming was fast and did not pay enough attention to the preparation work. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they also tightened the mechanical maintenance, and some even completed the mechanical maintenance for spring farming in advance, ready to start farming as soon as the ground thaws.

The staff of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee who went to the grassroots level generally paid attention to strengthening the ideological construction of the grassroots leadership cadres. They believed that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the broad masses, it must first be implemented among the grassroots leadership cadres. The leadership cadres' ideology is revolutionized, which can drive the broad masses' ideology to be revolutionized. The leadership cadres follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions closely, and the masses will follow closely. Many grassroots units in Heilongjiang Province have established revolutionary committees, but how to do a good job in the work of the revolutionary committees is a new problem. Many grassroots cadres lack work experience, and some have difficulties. The staff who went to the countryside and factories, based on these situations, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the grassroots cadres, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, recalled the bitterness of the old society, and thought about the sweetness of the new society. Through study, the broad grassroots cadres greatly increased their love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, greatly enhanced their class consciousness, strengthened their sense of revolution, and increased their work enthusiasm. Many grassroots cadres in Suihua Region, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, stood up straight to grasp the work, went to the places with the most problems and the hardest work. The cadres' ideology was revolutionized, which also drove the masses to grasp the revolution and promote production, launching a new high tide of preparation for farming.

The staff who went to the countryside and factories this time also joined the broad revolutionary workers and peasants to besiege bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, oppose anarchism, untied the knots of the two factions in some grassroots units, achieved revolutionary great unity, established a unified organization, and built and improved the grassroots leadership cadres, further inspiring the broad revolutionary masses to grasp the revolution and promote production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and do a good job in the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around and see for themselves, persist in the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses." The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized a large number of cadres to carry their luggage, bring Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, go deep into factories and rural areas, grasp the revolution, promote production, let the cadres experience the wind and rain on the front line of revolution and production, and further promote the revolutionization of the organs.

While sending a large number of staff to the countryside and factories, the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee also organized some staff from the former Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee's direct organs to go to the grassroots masses to lay the ideological foundation for doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. Since last winter, the revolutionary committees of most prefectures (cities) and counties in Heilongjiang Province have sent a large number of cadres to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, go deep into grassroots units, and work with the broad masses to grasp the revolution and promote production. Now, although it is still cold and snowy in Heilongjiang Province, in the vast fields, you can see cadres and community members working together with shovels and hoes, building farmland water conservancy, fertilizing, and preparing for farming in a lively manner.

    坚决执行毛主席最新指示，迅速实现领导机关革命化
    黑龙江革委会半数人员深入基层
    编者按：黑龙江省革命委员会的半数常委，带领二分之一的工作人员，深入工矿、农村基层单位，落实毛主席的最新指示。这是一项大刀阔斧的革命化措施。
    广大的工农群众在基层，大多数的干部在基层。抓不抓基层工作，是走不走群众路线的大问题，是愿不愿把新生的革命委员会的根基扎得更牢固的大问题，也是能不能使毛主席最新指示真正变为千百万群众的行动的大问题。因此，革命委员会应当把主要力量摆到基层去，对群众做深入细致的思想政治工作；而不能浮在上面，脱离群众，脱离实际，成为“空头司令部”。
    毛主席教导说：“把党的方针变为群众的方针，还须要我们长期坚持的、百折不挠的、艰苦卓绝的、耐心而不怕麻烦的努力。没有这样一种努力是一切都不成功的。”我们一定要坚持到基层去，到群众中去，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示，作百折不挠的努力。
    新华社哈尔滨二十九日电　黑龙江省革命委员会最近采取一项革命化措施，抽出二分之一的机关工作人员深入基层单位，同广大革命群众一起，扎扎实实地条条落实、全面落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示迅速化为广大群众的自觉行动，推动了当前的各项工作。
    黑龙江省革命委员会今年一月召开了扩大会议，参加会议的全体人员怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的心情，修订了原来制定的“实现机关革命化的规定”。会后，全体委员立即行动起来，由革命委员会半数的常委，带领革命委员会的大批工作人员，深入农村生产队和工矿企业等基层单位。下去以前，省革命委员会人员以“下去抓什么？怎样抓？”为题，开展了讨论。大家一致表示，下到基层，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事。不管任务有千条万条，全面落实毛主席的最新指示是最重要的一条。基层的工作有千头万绪，和广大革命群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，落实毛主席的最新指示，就是做好一切工作的根本。黑龙江省主要产粮区嫩江专区，去年农业获得大丰收，有些生产队的社员产生了盲目乐观情绪，对今年春耕生产的准备工作抓得不紧。省革命委员会的下乡人员就和社员一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，一起以毛主席的最新指示为武器总结去年的增产经验，检查今年的备耕工作。一些去年遭受天灾的生产大队，还回顾了去年靠毛泽东思想战胜天灾获得粮食增产的经过，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取今年农业的更大丰收。如甘南县太平大队，去年六月间曾遭到一场大冰雹，百分之七十的庄稼绝产。广大社员遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，团结一心，战胜灾害，把受灾农田毁掉重新种上，结果不但没有减产，还向国家交售了四百多万斤粮食。这个区的社员检查了当前备耕工作中的松懈思想，加紧了备耕生产。对原来认为底肥足，今年不用再添肥的农田，又送了粪肥。一些机耕面积较大的生产大队，原来认为机械耕地快，对备耕工作抓得不紧，在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，也加紧了机械检修，有的还把春耕用的机械提前检修好，只待春融大地就开犁生产。
    黑龙江省革命委员会深入到基层的工作人员，普遍注意加强基层领导班子的思想建设工作。他们认为，要使毛主席的最新指示在广大群众中落实，就首先要在基层领导班子中落实。领导班子思想革命化，就能带动广大群众思想革命化，领导班子对毛主席最新指示跟得紧，群众就跟得紧。黑龙江省的许多基层单位都建立了革命委员会，但是怎样做好革命委员会的工作，是个新的问题。广大基层干部工作经验不足，有的还有畏难情绪。下乡下厂的工作人员根据这些情况，同基层干部一起，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜。通过学习，广大基层干部大大增强了对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的热爱，大大提高了阶级觉悟，革命事业心增强了，工作积极性提高了。绥化地区的很多基层干部，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，挺起腰杆抓工作，到问题最多、工作最艰苦的地方去。干部思想革命化了，也就带动了群众大抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了备耕生产新高潮。
    这次下乡下厂的工作人员，还同广大工农革命群众一起围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，反对无政府主义，使一些基层单位的两派群众解开了疙瘩，实现了革命大联合，成立了统一的组织，建立和健全了基层领导班子，进一步鼓舞了广大革命群众狠抓革命、猛促生产的干劲。
    毛主席教导说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”黑龙江省革命委员会组织大批干部背着行李，带着毛主席的革命宝书，深入工厂、农村，抓革命，促生产，让干部在革命、生产第一线经风雨，见世面，进一步促进了机关革命化。
    黑龙江省革命委员会在派出大量工作人员下乡、下厂的同时，还组织原省委、省人民委员会一些直属机关的工作人员到基层群众中去，为搞好本单位的斗、批、改奠定思想基础。黑龙江省的多数专区（市）、县的革命委员会从去冬开始，就抽出大批干部，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层单位，和广大群众一道抓革命、促生产。现在，黑龙江省还是天寒地冻，大地积雪未化，但是，在广阔的田野里，到处可以看到干部和社员一起挥锹舞镐，兴修农田水利，积肥送粪，备耕生产搞得热火朝天。
