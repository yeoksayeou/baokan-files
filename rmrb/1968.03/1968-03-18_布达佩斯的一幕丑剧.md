From February 26 to March 5, a small clique of traitors and renegades from 66 organizations staged a so-called "Consultative Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties" in Budapest, putting on a counter-revolutionary farce. The traitorous clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin were the scriptwriters, directors, and main actors of this farce.

Since the traitorous clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they have completely inherited the mantle of Khrushchev's revisionism, continuing to implement Khrushchev's anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary, and anti-China policies. To fulfill Khrushchev's will to convene a world meeting of traitors and renegades, they have held countless large and small, various types of talks, meetings, and consultations, including the infamous reactionary 1965 March split meeting and the 1967 April European New Revisionist meeting in Karlovy Vary. After three years and four months of effort, they managed to cobble together this "consultative meeting," finally beginning the "official" preparations for the world meeting of traitors and renegades.

The Soviet revisionist leadership spared no effort in convening this "consultative meeting," intending to show that they still had some hegemony and that their baton still worked. However, once they started, it only exposed that their baton had long since lost its effectiveness.

Despite the Soviet revisionist leadership's use of threats, inducements, rumors, and deception, some people, for various reasons, still refused to attend. Even those who attended were each harboring their own schemes, with their own scripts and lines in their pockets. Seeing the situation deteriorate, the Soviet revisionists quickly abandoned their tricks of "democracy," "equality," and "consultation." On the first day of the meeting, they openly issued orders from Moscow, forcing the attendees to comply. However, people still did not buy it; some openly defied, some shot back covertly, and some talked about irrelevant matters.

The Soviet revisionists ordered that, neither too early nor too late, the world meeting of traitors and renegades must be held in November-December this year, just as Khrushchev had stipulated a certain year and month for a secret meeting. Some people said this was "too early," "conditions were not ripe," and that they needed to "prepare meticulously"; others even proposed holding another "consultative meeting" to decide later.

The Soviet revisionists ordered that the world meeting of traitors and renegades must fully discuss and summarize their counter-revolutionary revisionist "line" and "strategy" of restoring capitalism, surrendering to imperialism, and betraying the world people's revolution, and pass a comprehensive "programmatic document" that all revisionist parties must follow. Some people said, "You want to control us with this thing? No way."

And so on, and so forth.

In this way, they argued chaotically for eight days and nights. In the end, the Soviet revisionists had no choice but to stubbornly issue an order, setting the meeting for November-December this year in Moscow, and then hastily concluded the meeting.

The farce directed by the Soviet revisionist leadership was indeed ugly beyond description.

The Soviet revisionists had another purpose in convening this "consultative meeting," which was to declare to U.S. imperialism that there was a group of people following the revisionist path, sabotaging the world revolution, in order to raise their own status and do a deal with the United States. However, this plan was also difficult to realize. U.S. imperialism looked down on the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique; they had already compared today's U.S.-Soviet relations to U.S.-British relations.

The Soviet ruling clique is deteriorating with each generation. If Khrushchev of yesteryears still pretended to want to sit alongside U.S. imperialism and jointly rule the world, then the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, having been in power for just over three years, have already degenerated into little partners of U.S. imperialism. Today, they can only follow the tail of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a pulp by the Vietnamese people, with nowhere to turn, so the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique keep running around for them, acting as brokers for the U.S. "peace" conspiracy. U.S. imperialism orders Israel to launch an invasion, and the Soviet revisionists pressure Arab countries to surrender, sending Kosygin rushing to Glasburg to pay homage and seek surrender. U.S. imperialism wants to maintain nuclear monopoly and engage in nuclear blackmail, so the Soviet revisionist clique joins the U.S. in concocting a draft treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique's decision to hold a counter-revolutionary black meeting in November-December this year is also to adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism, to cooperate with the U.S. presidential election, and to present gifts to the new master of the White House.

Hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat is a common trick of the Soviet revisionist leadership. Clearly acting as the henchmen and slaves of imperialism, they insist on posing as "anti-imperialist heroes." In this meeting, they shamelessly shouted about "anti-imperialism," which is merely an attempt to cover up their traitorous and renegade faces of surrendering to U.S. imperialism and betraying the world people's revolution.

This so-called "Budapest Consultative Meeting" was another anti-China black meeting. Before the meeting, Brezhnev and Kosygin personally stirred up a small anti-China wave. During the meeting, Suslov took the stage to lead the vicious anti-China attacks. After the meeting, the Soviet revisionists engaged in intense anti-China activities, attempting to organize an anti-China chorus. Unfortunately, the response was sparse and few. Don't they want to be anti-China? No. It's not that they don't want to, but they can't.

Today, the world has entered a new era of revolution under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is achieving comprehensive victory, exerting an increasingly profound influence on the world. All Marxist-Leninist parties, organizations, and revolutionary people around the world, under the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing in victory. The revolutionary people of all countries will surely sweep away all harmful elements and achieve final victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggle against the revolutionary forces." "To make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique's decision to hold the world meeting of traitors and renegades by the end of this year is a manifestation of this desperate struggle. Khrushchev has long been overthrown. The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, following in Khrushchev's footsteps, will certainly not escape the same fate.

　　布达佩斯的一幕丑剧
　　本报评论员
    二月二十六日到三月五日，六十六个单位的一小撮叛徒工贼在布达佩斯举行了所谓“共产党和工人党协商会晤”，又演出了一幕反革命丑剧。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团，是这场丑剧的编剧、导演和主角。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团上台以来，完全继承了赫鲁晓夫的修正主义的衣钵，继续执行赫鲁晓夫的反共、反人民、反革命、反华的政策。他们为了完成赫鲁晓夫召开世界叛徒工贼集会的遗志，举行了数不清的，大大小小、形形色色的会谈、会晤、会议，包括臭名昭著的反动的一九六五年三月分裂会议，和一九六七年四月欧洲新工贼卡罗维发利会议。前后花费了三年零四个月的时间，勉强拼凑了这次“协商会晤”，才算开始了世界叛徒工贼集会的“正式的”筹备工作。
    苏修领导集团煞费心机召开这次“协商会晤”，本来是要显示一下，他们还有点霸权，他们的指挥棒还灵。可是，不开则已，一开，反而更加暴露了它的指挥棒早已不灵了。
    尽管苏修领导集团施尽了威胁利诱、造谣欺骗的手段，仍然有些人出于不同考虑，拒绝到会。就是到场表演的人，也是各怀鬼胎，口袋里装着自己的台词和脚本。苏修一看情况不妙，赶紧把什么“民主”、“平等”、“协商”之类的把戏，统统收起，在会议发言的第一天，就公开下达了莫斯科的命令，强制与会者遵照执行。但是，人们还是不买账，有的公开顶撞，有的施放暗箭，有的王顾左右而言他。
    苏修下令说，不早不晚，必须象赫鲁晓夫规定某某年十二月开黑会那样，在今年十一——十二月召开世界叛徒工贼集会。有些人说，这“为时过早”，“条件不成熟”，要“周密准备”；还有人干脆提出再来一次“协商会晤”，到时候再定。
    苏修下令说，世界叛徒工贼大集会必须全面讨论和总结他们复辟资本主义、投降帝国主义、出卖世界人民革命的反革命修正主义的“路线”和“战略”，通过一个各修党都必须遵守的全面的“纲领性文件”。有些人说，你想用这个玩艺儿控制我们，不干。
    等等、等等。
    就这样，乱哄哄地吵了八天八夜。最后，苏修又只好硬着头皮，赤裸裸地下个命令，规定今年十一——十二月在莫斯科开会，就草草收场。
    苏修领导集团导演的这幕丑剧，实在丑得不象样子。
    苏修召开这次“协商会晤”，还有一个目的，就是要向美帝国主义表白，有那么一帮子人跟它走修正主义道路，破坏世界革命，以便抬高自己身价，同美国搞一揽子买卖。但是，这个打算也难实现。美帝国主义根本看不起勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团，他们已经把今天的美苏关系比之为美英关系。
    苏修统治集团一代不如一代。如果说，当年的赫鲁晓夫还装模作样，要同美帝国主义平起平坐，共同主宰世界的话，那末，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团上台才三年多，就堕落成为美帝国主义的小伙伴，今天他们只能跟着美帝国主义的屁股转。美帝国主义被越南人民打得焦头烂额，走投无路，苏修集团的头目就不停地为之东奔西跑，充当美帝“和谈”阴谋的掮客。美帝国主义指使以色列发动侵略战争，苏修就压阿拉伯国家投降，并派柯西金急急忙忙赶到葛拉斯堡罗去朝觐求降。美帝国主义要保持核垄断，进行核讹诈，苏修集团就同美帝一起炮制出防止核扩散的条约草案。现在苏修集团规定在今年十一——十二月召开反革命黑会，也是为了适应美帝国主义的需要，配合美国今年的大选，向新选出的白宫主子献礼。
    挂羊头、卖狗肉是苏修领导集团的惯技。明明是帝国主义的帮凶和奴仆，却硬要装成是“反帝英雄”。他们在这次会上，又厚颜无耻地喧嚷什么“反帝”，这不过是妄图用来掩盖他们投降美帝国主义、出卖世界人民革命的叛徒工贼面目而已。
    这次所谓“布达佩斯协商会晤”，是又一次反华的黑会。会前，勃列日涅夫、柯西金亲自出马，煽起了一股小小的反华浪潮。会上，苏斯洛夫又粉墨登场，带头进行恶毒的反华。会下，苏修又进行紧张的反华活动，企图组织一场反华大合唱。可惜，响应者零零落落，屈指可数。难道他们不想反华吗？否。非不为也，是不能也。
    今天，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得全面的胜利，对全世界产生着越来越深远的影响。全世界的马克思列宁主义政党、组织和革命人民，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗指引下正在乘胜前进。各国的革命人民，必将扫除一切害人虫，取得最后胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团下决心在今年年底召开世界叛徒工贼大集会，就是这种垂死挣扎的一个表现。赫鲁晓夫早就垮台了。步着赫鲁晓夫覆辙走的勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，绝对逃不脱同样的命运。
