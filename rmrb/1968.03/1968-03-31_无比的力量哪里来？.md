The surging Yellow River, with ice floes pushing a small, out-of-control boat, rushed down the rapids. It seemed imminent that the boat would be swept into the overflow opening of the Sanmenxia Dam, leading to a tragic incident of the boat breaking apart and people drowning...

At this critical moment, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, comrades of the revolutionary masses, workers from the dam area, and farmers from the surrounding countryside rushed to the scene, vying with each other to rescue the twenty-seven class brothers on the boat.

Where did these rescue heroes get their strength from, daring to challenge the rapids and fight against the ice floes?

It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave them unparalleled strength.

It was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other" that brought together a powerful rescue team.

It was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "The masses are the real heroes" that inspired everyone to contribute ideas and find ways to rescue.

It was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "The unity of the army and the people is as one, see who can defeat us" that directed twelve rescue heroes to embark on their mission.

It was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them" that inspired the rescue heroes to raise their arms and forge a path through the ice.

It was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" that inspired both the endangered comrades and the rescue heroes to fight to the end until victory.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts directed the entire process of this rescue battle.

With Mao Zedong Thought, there is unparalleled strength; by following Chairman Mao closely, there is no challenge that cannot be overcome. This is an unshakable truth. The victory of the Sanmenxia rescue struggle has once again provided a vivid example of this truth.

    无比的力量哪里来？
    滔滔黄河，一排排冰凌拥着一只失掉控制的小船，急流直下，眼看就要被卷入三门峡大坝溢流孔。一场船碎人亡的不幸事件，转眼就要发生了……
    在这千钧一发之际，解放军的战士，无产阶级革命派的同志，坝区的职工，四乡的农民，闻风而至，争先恐后，协同一致，救出了船上的二十七名阶级兄弟。
    这些抢险的勇士哪里来的力量，敢于向激流挑战，敢于同冰凌搏斗？
    是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给了他们无比的力量。
    是毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的伟大教导，召来了一支强大的抢险队伍。
    是毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的伟大教导，鼓舞着大家出谋献策，找出了抢险的办法。
    是毛主席“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的伟大教导，指挥着十二名抢险勇士踏上征途。
    是毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的伟大教导，激励着抢险勇士奋起双臂，在冰块中开辟航道。
    是毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，鼓舞着遇险的同志和抢险的勇士坚持斗争到最后胜利。
    毛主席的光辉思想，指挥着这场抢险战斗的全部进程。
    有了毛泽东思想就有无比的力量，紧跟毛主席就无往而不胜。这是一条颠扑不破的真理。三门峡抢险斗争的胜利，又为这一真理，提供了一个生动的例证。
