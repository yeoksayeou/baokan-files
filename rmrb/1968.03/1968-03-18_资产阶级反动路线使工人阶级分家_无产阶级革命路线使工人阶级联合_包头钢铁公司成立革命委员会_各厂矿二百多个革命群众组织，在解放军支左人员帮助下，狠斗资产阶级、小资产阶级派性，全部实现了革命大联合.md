The bourgeois reactionary line divides the working class, the proletarian revolutionary line unites the working class.

The Baotou Steel Company establishes a revolutionary committee.

Over 200 revolutionary mass organizations in various factories and mines, with the help of the PLA's leftist support personnel, have resolutely fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and have fully achieved revolutionary great unity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 17th: The revolutionary workers of Baotou Steel Company, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, have resolutely overcome the "self" in their minds with the help of the PLA Air Force's leftist support personnel from the Beijing Military Region. They have quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, establishing the Baotou Steel Company Revolutionary Committee. Over 80% of the factories and mines under Baotou Steel have also established revolutionary committees.

In July and August of last year, when the mass organizations in the Baotou region were split into two factions due to the instigation of a handful of class enemies, the revolutionary workers of Baotou Steel closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They consistently directed their attacks at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and resolutely carried out a revolutionary great criticism. They refused to participate in the struggles between the two factions in society, making significant contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Baotou City.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," reached Baotou Steel, the workers, with the help of the leftist support troops, quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. The over 200 revolutionary mass organizations in various factories and mines quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

During the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, the workers of Baotou Steel underwent a sharp ideological struggle.

At that time, several major organizations in Baotou City were engaged in "internal wars," and there were no signs of unity. Some leaders of the mass organizations in Baotou Steel advocated waiting and seeing, saying, "There is no basis for unity now; we cannot take the lead. Even if we unite, it won't be stable." The broad masses of workers in Baotou Steel resolutely opposed this erroneous idea. They believed that implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive required every second to be precious. This was not a matter of taking the lead or not, but a fundamental attitude of loyalty to Chairman Mao. They said: The working class is the leading class. If we unite first, it will be a heavy blow to the class enemies. If other organizations do not unite, we will unite, and then promote their unity. Many masses did not wait for the leaders to reach an agreement, and many factory and mine mass organizations did not wait for the higher-level organizations to arrange, but quickly united according to Chairman Mao's battle call.

During the great unity process, the broad masses of workers in Baotou Steel did not cling to the interests of small groups or small hills. Instead, they criticized themselves more and did not hold grudges. Some large organizations with thousands of people actively united with small organizations with only a few dozen people, not vying for the core. The Steelmaking Plant had an organization with nearly 200 people who actively sought out an opposing organization with only four people to discuss unity. The other side was afraid of being "swallowed up" and did not want to talk to them. Some people became impatient and said, "Forget it, four people are not even worth our attention. Without you, we can still make a revolution." Later, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all humanity" and realized that the working class is a whole. Unity is not about the number of people; the working class cannot be divided. If we cannot even accommodate four worker comrades now, how can we talk about uniting the world's proletariat to carry out a world revolution? With this realization, their minds became clear, and they repeatedly criticized themselves to that small organization. The two factions finally united closely.

Some workers in Baotou Steel stood on the wrong side during the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but later recognized their mistakes. During the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, some revolutionary mass organizations were unwilling to unite with them. However, the broad revolutionary masses, with the help of the leftist support troops, realized that firmly believing in the majority of the masses is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They linked their factory's situation, seeing that after more than a year of Cultural Revolution struggle practice, most of those who had previously stood on the wrong side had awakened. They could not "revolutionize alone" and fail to see others' progress. However, some people still proposed, "Our struggle is an irreconcilable struggle of lines." Many workers responded: We have a life-and-death struggle of two lines with China's Khrushchev. We should welcome those who have awakened from standing on the wrong side and revolutionize together. After the broad masses united, those who had previously stood on the wrong side felt unprecedented warmth. They sighed: China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line divided the working class in half, and Chairman Mao's latest directive united us again.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The working class must change the whole of society in the struggle against class enemies and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time change itself. The working class must learn in work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." The broad revolutionary masses of Baotou Steel, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings and with the help of the leftist support troops, launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively. They held various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 90% of the workers participating in phases and batches, deeply engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad masses of workers seriously examined various selfish thoughts in their units, organizations, and minds. Many people, after realizing the nature of their factionalism, deeply felt: We were truly "in the faction but unaware of it," bitten by a snake without feeling the pain. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely eliminate factionalism from the ranks of the working class.

The workers of Baotou Steel put Chairman Mao's teachings into practice, adhering to the revolutionary academic style of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought advocated by Chairman Mao himself, and expressing their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with practical actions. The workers of Baotou Steel closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, achieved revolutionary great unity, established the company's revolutionary committee, and strode forward towards the great goal of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　资产阶级反动路线使工人阶级分家　无产阶级革命路线使工人阶级联合
　　包头钢铁公司成立革命委员会
    各厂矿二百多个革命群众组织，在解放军支左人员帮助下，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，全部实现了革命大联合
    据新华社呼和浩特十七日电　包头钢铁公司的广大革命工人，在人民解放军北京部队空军支左人员的帮助下，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，坚决克服自己头脑中的私字，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，成立了包头钢铁公司革命委员会。包钢所属各厂、矿也有百分之八十以上成立了革命委员会。
    去年七八月间，在包头地区的群众组织由于一小撮阶级敌人的挑拨而分裂成为两大派的时候，包钢的广大革命工人紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持把矛头始终对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，坚决开展革命的大批判，坚决不参加社会上两派的斗争，对包头市的文化大革命作出了贡献。
    伟大领袖毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示传来后，包钢工人在支左部队的帮助下“跑步集合”，各厂矿的二百多个革命群众组织很快就全部实现了革命大联合。
    在实现革命大联合过程中，包钢工人经历了一场尖锐的思想斗争。
    当时包头市几大组织正在打“内战”，还没有联合起来的迹象。包钢有些群众组织的头头就主张等一等看，有的说“现在联合没有基础，我们不能抢先，联起来也巩固不住”。包钢广大工人坚决反对这种错误思想，他们认为，执行毛主席的最新指示，就要分秒必争，这不是抢先不抢先的问题，而是忠不忠于毛主席这样一个根本态度问题。大家说：工人阶级是领导阶级，我们先联合起来，就是对阶级敌人最沉重的打击，别的组织不联合我们联合，我们联合了再促进他们联合。许多群众不等头头达成协议，许多厂矿的群众组织不等上级组织布置，就根据毛主席的战斗号令，迅速联合了起来。
    在大联合的过程中，包钢广大工人不是抱着小团体、小山头的利益不放，而是双方多作自我批评，不抱成见。有些上千人的大组织，主动联合几十个人的小组织，不争核心。炼钢厂有一个近二百人的组织，主动找对立面一个只有四个人的组织谈判联合。对方怕被“吃掉”，不愿同他们谈。有些人不耐烦了，说：“算了，四个人连我们的零头都够不上，少了你们，照样闹革命。”以后，他们学习了毛主席关于“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”的教导，认识到工人阶级是一个整体，联合不在人多人少，工人阶级不能分家，现在连四个工人弟兄都容纳不下，怎么谈得上联合全世界无产阶级进行世界革命呢？这样一来，思想豁然开朗，就三番五次地向那个小组织做自我批评，两派终于紧密地团结了起来。
    包钢有一些工人在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期站错了队，但是后来已经认识到自己的错误。在实现革命大联合中，有些革命群众组织不同意跟他们联合。但是广大革命工人在支左部队的帮助下认识到，坚定地相信群众的大多数，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心。大家联系本厂的情况，看到经过一年多文化大革命的斗争实践，过去站错队的同志，现在大多数已经觉醒过来，自己决不能“唯我独革”，看不到人家的进步。但是还有人提出，“我们之间的斗争是不可调和的路线斗争”。许多工人回答说：我们同中国赫鲁晓夫才是你死我活的两条路线斗争。对待过去站错了队而现在已经觉醒过来的同志，应该欢迎他们，一起革命。广大群众联合起来以后，原先站错队的同志感到从来没有这样亲切。他们感慨地说：中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线把我们工人阶级分成两半，毛主席的最新指示又把我们团结到一起了。
    毛主席教导说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”包钢广大革命工人遵照毛主席的教导，在支左部队帮助下，广泛开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，举办了多种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，有百分之九十以上的工人分期分批参加了学习，深入地进行斗私批修。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，广大工人群众认真检查了本单位、本组织和自己头脑中的各种私心杂念。许多人对自己的派性提高了认识后，深有感触地说：我们真是“身在派中不知派”，被毒蛇咬了还不觉痛。我们一定要听毛主席的话，坚决把派性从工人阶级的队伍中清除出去。
    包钢工人对毛主席的教导学了就用，坚持毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，以实际行动来表达自己无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。包钢工人紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，实现了革命大联合，建立了公司的革命委员会，向着夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大目标奋勇前进。
