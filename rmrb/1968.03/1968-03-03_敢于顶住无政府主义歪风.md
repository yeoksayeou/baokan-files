		Dare to Resist the Anarchist Trend
		Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill Old Worker Yè Xiǎomèi

		I am a workshop foreman responsible for arranging and transferring personnel. I have noticed that a segment of workers have exhibited anarchist tendencies, which seriously affect the normal progress of production.

		We must resolutely fight against anarchist behavior. Practice has proven that as long as we cadres take our work seriously, these problems can be solved. For example, at one time, a few female workers who lived far from the factory requested to leave an hour earlier to go home and feed their children. They believed that the original half-hour feeding time was unreasonable and was a "stale framework," and that following the old system was "slavery." At that time, some people "could not resist" this trend and wanted to agree to their unreasonable demands. If we agreed to one person leaving early, it would inevitably affect other comrades. A socialist enterprise absolutely cannot allow this anarchist tendency to spread. Therefore, I had heart-to-heart talks with those who requested to leave early. On one hand, I encouraged them to bring their children to the factory's nursery, and on the other hand, I used my own suffering in the old society to awaken their consciousness. I said: In the old society, I had given birth to five children, and each time I was pregnant, I was driven out of the factory and wandered the streets. Four of my children died. Now, thanks to Chairman Mao, we have maternity leave when giving birth, and the factory has a well-equipped nursery. We should cherish this happiness. I also told these young comrades: We cannot regard all existing rules and regulations as stale frameworks, nor can we regard adherence to reasonable rules as slavery. Indiscriminately regarding all reasonable systems as stale frameworks, superficially appearing to have a strong spirit of rebellion, and not being a slave to the old system, in essence, this is being a slave to the thought of anarchism that negates everything, being a slave to "selfishness." After explaining the reasoning, they also gave up their original ideas.

		The Party and the people have placed us in the position of cadres, and we must fulfill our responsibilities. A socialist enterprise needs cadres who do socialist work. Some cadres have made mistakes in the past, said the wrong things, and corrected them; if because of past mistakes, they do not resent and fight against behaviors that violate national and collective interests, this would be compounding the error. I am a Communist Party member and I am already fifty-six years old. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives more diligently, promote revolution and production, and contribute all my strength to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    敢于顶住无政府主义歪风
    北京国棉二厂老工人　叶小妹
    我在车间担任工长的职务，负责人员的安排和调动。我看到在一部分工人中出现的无政府主义现象，严重影响了生产的正常进行。
    对无政府主义的行为必须进行坚决斗争。实践证明：只要我们当干部的认真把工作抓起来，这些问题是可以得到解决的。例如有一个时期，个别离厂较远的女工，要求提早一小时下班回家给孩子喂奶，她们认为原来规定半小时的喂奶时间是不合理的，是“旧框框”，按旧制度做，就是“奴隶主义”。当时也有人“顶不住”这股风，想同意她们的不合理要求。这时如果答应一个人提前走，势必影响其他同志。一个社会主义企业，绝不能让这种无政府主义倾向蔓延开来。于是我就和那些要求提早下班的同志谈心，一方面动员她们把孩子带到工厂乳儿室，另一方面用我自己在旧社会所受的苦，启发她们的觉悟。我说：在旧社会，我曾经生过五个孩子，每怀一次孕就被赶出工厂，流落街头，五个孩子就死了四个。现在托毛主席的福，生孩子有产假，厂内还有设备良好的乳儿室。我们应该珍惜这种幸福。我还向这些青年同志谈到：对原有的规章制度不能一律看成是框框，也不能把遵守合理的规章看成是奴隶主义。不分青红皂白，把合理的制度都看成框框，表面上看来好象“造反精神”很强，不做“旧制度”的奴隶，实质上，这正是做了否定一切的无政府主义思想的奴隶，做了“私”字的奴隶。道理讲清了，她们也就打消了原来的想法。
    党和人民把我们放在干部的岗位上，我们就要尽自己的责任。社会主义企业就要有干社会主义的干部。有些干部过去做了错事，说了错话，改了就好；如果因为自己过去犯了一些错误，现在对违反国家和集体利益的行为不愤恨，不斗争，这就要错上加错。我是一个共产党员，今年已经五十六岁了。今后我一定要更好地学习毛主席著作和最新指示，抓革命促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献自己的全部力量。
