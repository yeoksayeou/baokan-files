Recently, some representatives attending the Third Session of the Styling Mao Zedong's Works Active Members of the Artillery Corps of the Shenyang Military Region held a discussion on the importance of strengthening revolutionary discipline. They unanimously agreed that at present, it is crucial to thoroughly bury bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and to strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. This is an important guarantee for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Below are some of the speeches given by representatives at the discussion.

Someone might say, "As long as you dare to rebel, it doesn't matter if you violate a bit of discipline." How should we view this problem?

Organizational Section Chief Meng Fanxin believes that this view is incorrect. He said: Voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Our great leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "The strength of this army lies in the fact that all those who participate in this army possess self-discipline." Reflecting on the war years, I deeply feel that our unconditional loyalty to our great leader Mao Zedong is the ideological foundation for voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline. As long as we are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao in any situation, we can voluntarily uphold revolutionary discipline, unite all revolutionary forces, and achieve victory in the revolution.

In 1950, our unit entered the southwestern minority regions to carry out anti-bandit operations. The unit entered the deep mountains and forests, cut off from the outside world, and could not get oil, salt, or vegetables. Officers and soldiers suffered from severe "night blindness," making it difficult for comrades to see the words on the books during the day and to see each other's faces at night. In such a situation, how could we voluntarily uphold revolutionary discipline? This was a severe test for us. The entire company repeatedly studied the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, recalling how Chairman Mao led the Red Army to climb snow-capped mountains and cross grasslands, preferring to eat grass and tree bark rather than take a needle or thread from the people. Everyone said, thinking of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, what are these hardships? The more difficult it is, the more we should be loyal to Chairman Mao and voluntarily uphold discipline, not taking a single leaf of vegetables or grain of salt from the people. The entire company not only voluntarily upheld revolutionary discipline but also appeared many examples of mutual care and love for the people. Everyone was filled with revolutionary optimism, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to pursue bandits during the day, and helping the people fetch water, chop firewood, and sweep the courtyard after settling down. If they fainted, they would get up and continue working and fighting. With no vegetables to eat, they would go up the mountain to dig wild vegetables, and with no salt, they would eat bland food. Our actions deeply moved the local minority people. Previously, due to the reactionary propaganda of the bandits, the people dared not approach us, but now they rushed to send their scarce vegetables and salt to the company. We still strictly adhered to the revolutionary discipline formulated by Chairman Mao, politely declining them one by one, and enthusiastically propagating the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to further strengthen the relationship between the military and the people. Many people voluntarily provided us with intelligence and guided us, participating in the battle together. In this way, relying on voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline, the military and the people united as one, successfully completing the anti-bandit task. On the day our company left the station, the local people came to see us off, tears in their eyes, presenting us with a banner on which were embroidered the eight shining golden words: "Discipline is Strict, Not a Single Hair is Taken."

Recalling the war years, we, with a red heart of unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao, voluntarily upheld revolutionary discipline, overcame difficulties, united the people, annihilated the enemy, and won the victory of the revolution. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has issued a series of new instructions. We must, with a deep class sentiment of love for Chairman Mao, unconditionally implement all of Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely uphold proletarian revolutionary discipline, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the touchstone to measure whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Will voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline restrict revolutionary rebellious spirit?

Political Instructor Zhao Xingtang believes that revolutionary spirit and discipline are consistent. He said:

Revolutionary youths must be models of voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline.

Mao Zedong says: "Communist Party members in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army should become models of brave fighting, executing orders, observing discipline, political work, and internal unity and solidarity." Chairman Mao's five models clearly tell us that revolutionary rebellious spirit and discipline are consistent.

In 1950, during the liberation of Southwest China, we were once ordered to hide on a certain high point to prepare for an ambush. At that time, it was late autumn, and it was raining heavily. Comrades, soaked in wet clothes, lay in the mud, cold and hungry, enduring for three days and nights without seeing the enemy. Hearing the sound of gunfire from the distant brother units fighting the enemy, our hearts itched. At that time, every comrade had a fearless revolutionary spirit, eager to jump out of the trench and strike the enemy to thoroughly annihilate the remnants and liberate the suffering class brothers. However, thinking of Chairman Mao's instruction to "strengthen discipline, and revolution will be invincible," every comrade happily endured the cold and hunger, strictly observing all the regulations of the superiors, and stayed firmly in the mud like nails. When the enemy arrived, everyone gritted their teeth, eager to immediately wipe them out, but the platoon leader had not given the order, so no one fired a shot or said a word. The soldiers clearly knew that if anyone did not observe the discipline, spoke, or fired first, it would expose the entire battle plan and help the enemy because of violating the discipline. Precisely because the comrades at that time unified their bravery in fighting with revolutionary discipline, when the enemy approached, the platoon leader gave the order: Fire! Instantly, the sound of gunfire shook the sky, and the unexpected firepower made the enemy dizzy. Our more than thirty comrades killed and wounded more than three hundred enemies, captured more than four hundred, disrupted the enemy's deployment, and created favorable conditions for the main force to annihilate the enemy.

I have realized from practice: Discipline has class characteristics. Voluntarily upholding proletarian revolutionary discipline is a manifestation of a high level of political awareness of revolutionary soldiers and is also a practical action of loyalty to Chairman Mao. This is fundamentally different from the "slavishness" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. To treat discipline with personal will, doing whatever one wants, and no one can control it, is not at all the so-called "revolutionary rebellious spirit," but a typical anarchism. Proletarian revolutionary pioneers must be models of voluntarily upholding revolutionary discipline and achieve new merits for the people in the struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When executing revolutionary discipline, if one thinks it is "unreasonable" and a "frame," and resists, what should be done?

Film Group Leader Jiang Shizhou's experience is:

Only by voluntarily "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" can one resolutely uphold revolutionary discipline.

Our great leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "It is necessary to improve discipline, resolutely execute orders, policies, and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, unite the military and the people, unite the military and the government, unite officers and soldiers, unite the entire army, and do not allow any phenomenon of violating discipline to exist."

Last year, the unit, in accordance with Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, established a large school of Mao Zedong Thought, and dug a coal pit by itself. I thought, since we produced the coal ourselves, we could burn it freely. However, as soon as winter came, the regiment party committee issued a regulation on saving coal. At that time, I felt that the leadership did not care about the people's lives, thinking that this regulation was unreasonable, so I did not take it seriously. Therefore, before the stipulated heating period, I casually took a few pieces of coal from the coal pile to light the stove. Comrades saw this and criticized me for not observing the regulations and lacking organizational discipline awareness. With this issue in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every party member, every part of the work, every word or action must start from the interests of the whole party and absolutely not allow this principle to be violated." Through study, I realized that resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great directive to "further save and make revolution" and supporting industrial and agricultural production is a concrete action of truly caring for the people's lives. Then, why can't I voluntarily observe this regulation? I dug deep into the root cause: originally, it was the "self" in my mind playing tricks, revolving around "me," executing the correct regulations of the superiors that suit me and not executing those that do not suit me, isn't this influenced by anarchist thoughts? Therefore, I grabbed the tail of this "self" and relentlessly pursued it.

Proletarian revolutionary discipline is the discipline of "publicness." Those with selfishness cannot voluntarily execute and strictly observe it. With the improvement of understanding, the consciousness of executing regulations and observing discipline also increased. Since winter, I have required myself to meticulously implement the regulations of the superiors, paying attention to saving coal for the country every time I light the fire.

This small matter gave me a great education. I realized: Voluntarily upholding proletarian revolutionary discipline is executing Chairman Mao's instructions; the process of executing proletarian revolutionary discipline is the process of fighting selfishness. Only by voluntarily fighting selfishness can one resolutely execute proletarian revolutionary discipline. At present, we must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public." While annihilating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, we must also annihilate and defeat anarchism.

　　无限忠于毛主席　自觉遵守革命纪律
　　——沈阳部队炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子座谈加强革命纪律的重要性
    最近，出席沈阳部队炮兵第三届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的部分代表，在会议期间，重温了毛主席关于加强组织纪律性的教导，座谈了加强无产阶级革命纪律的重要意义。他们一致认为，当前，彻底埋葬资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，是全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。
    下面，是部分代表在座谈会上的发言。
    有人认为，“只要敢造反就行，违反一点纪律没有什么关系”。对这个问题，应该这样看吗？
    组织股长孟凡信认为，不能这样看。他说：自觉遵守革命纪律，是忠于毛主席的重要标志
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律”。回忆战争年代的战斗生活，我深深体会到，对我们伟大导师毛主席无限忠诚，是自觉遵守革命纪律的思想基础，只要我们在任何情况下，都无限忠于毛主席，就能自觉遵守革命纪律，团结一切革命力量，夺取革命胜利。
    一九五○年，我们部队进驻大西南少数民族地区，执行剿匪任务。部队到了深山密林，和外地隔绝了，吃不到油、盐、菜，干部、战士得了严重的“夜盲症”，同志们白天瞪眼看不见书上的字，夜晚面对面看不着人。在这种情况下，怎样自觉地遵守革命纪律？这是对我们的严峻考验。我们全连反复学习毛主席亲手制定的
  “三大纪律八项注意”，回忆毛主席率领红军爬雪山、过草地，宁肯吃草根树皮，不拿群众一针一线的光荣革命传统。大家都说，想起毛主席的伟大革命实践，眼前的这点困难算个啥，我们越艰苦越要忠于毛主席，自觉遵守纪律，不吃群众一叶菜、一粒盐。全连同志不仅自觉地遵守革命纪律，而且出现了许多互相关心、爱护群众的生动事例。大家充满着革命乐观主义精神，白天爬山越岭追剿土匪，住下后还帮助群众打水、劈柴、扫院。昏倒了，爬起来，继续坚持工作、战斗。没菜吃，上山挖野菜，没盐，就吃淡的。我们的行动，深深感动了当地少数民族的群众。过去因受土匪的反动宣传，不敢接近我们的群众，这时，纷纷把自己仅有的菜和盐送到连队，我们仍然严格遵守毛主席制定的革命纪律，一一婉言谢绝，还向他们热情宣传“三大纪律八项注意”，进一步密切了军民关系。许多群众主动地给我们送情报、带路，一起参加战斗。就这样，依靠自觉遵守革命纪律，军民团结成一个整体，胜利地完成了剿匪任务。我们连离开驻地那天，当地群众流着眼泪前来送行，赠给我们一面旗帜，上面绣着“纪律严明，秋毫无犯”八个金光闪闪的大字。
    回想战争年代，我们怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的一颗红心，自觉遵守革命纪律，战胜了困难，团结了人民，消灭了敌人，赢得了革命的胜利。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，毛主席发出了一系列最新指示，我们要怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一切指示，坚决遵守无产阶级革命纪律，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。这是衡量我们是不是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的试金石。
    自觉遵守革命纪律，会不会限制革命造反精神？
    教导员赵兴堂认为，革命性与纪律性是一致的。他说：
    革命小将必须是自觉遵守革命纪律的模范
    毛主席说：“共产党员在八路军和新四军中，应该成为英勇作战的模范，执行命令的模范，遵守纪律的模范，政治工作的模范和内部团结统一的模范。”毛主席讲的五个模范，清楚地告诉我们，革命造反精神与纪律性是一致的。
    一九五○年解放大西南时，有一次我们奉命在某高点隐蔽，准备打伏击。当时正值深秋季节，天下着大雨，同志们穿着湿淋淋的衣服趴在泥水里，又冷又饿，一连熬了三天三夜，还不见敌人的面。听着远方兄弟部队同敌人战斗的枪炮声，心里直发痒。当时我们每个同志都有一往无前的革命精神，为彻底消灭残匪，解放受苦的阶级兄弟，恨不得立即跳出堑壕，痛击敌人。可是一想到毛主席“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，我们每个同志都愉快地忍受着寒冷和饥饿，严格地遵守上级的一切规定，象钉子一样钉在泥水中。当敌人到来时，个个咬牙切齿，恨不得立刻把他们干掉，可是排长没下命令，谁也不打一枪，谁也不说一句话。战士们清楚地知道，谁如果不遵守纪律，说了话，或者先开了枪，就会暴露了整个作战意图，就会因违反纪律而帮助了敌人。正因为当时同志们把勇敢作战统一在革命的纪律上，所以，直到敌人爬到跟前，排长一声令下：打！刹时枪声震天，出敌不意的火力把敌人打得晕头转向。我们三十多名同志，打死打伤敌人三百多，活捉了四百多个，打乱了敌人的部署，给大部队全歼敌人创造了有利条件。
    我从实践中体会到：纪律是有阶级性的。自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，是革命战士具有高度政治觉悟的表现，也是忠于毛主席的实际行动。这与中国赫鲁晓夫所提倡的“奴隶主义”有着本质的区别。以个人的意愿来对待纪律，想咋干就咋干，谁也管不了，这根本不是什么“革命造反精神”，而是典型的无政府主义。无产阶级革命闯将，必须做自觉遵守革命纪律的模范，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中为人民立新功。
    在执行革命纪律时，自以为“不合理”，是“框框”，顶了“牛”，怎么办？
    电影组长姜世洲的体会是：
    只有自觉地“斗私，批修”，才能坚决地遵守革命纪律
    伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，军民一致，军政一致，官兵一致，全军一致，不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。”
    去年，部队遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，大办毛泽东思想大学校，自己动手开了一口煤井。我心里想，自己生产了煤，烧起来就能随便点了。可是刚入冬，团党委就作出了节约用煤的规定。当时，我感到领导上不关心群众生活，认为这个规定不合理，就没有把它放在眼里。因此，还没到规定的烤火期就随便到煤堆里搬几块煤来生炉子。同志们看见了就批评我不遵守规定，缺乏组织纪律观念。我带着这个问题，学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”通过学习我认识到，坚决执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，支援工农业生产，是真正关心人民群众生活的具体行动。那末，我为什么不能自觉地遵守这个规定呢？我狠挖了思想根源：原来是脑子里的“私”字作怪，以“我”为转移，对待上级的正确规定，适合我的就执行，不适合我的就不执行，不正是受了无政府主义思潮的影响吗？于是，我抓住了这个“私”字的尾巴，就穷追猛打。
    无产阶级的革命纪律，就是“公”字的纪律。有私心的人，就必然不能自觉地执行、严格地遵守。认识提高了，执行纪律、遵守规定的自觉性也高了。入冬以来，我处处要求自己一丝不苟地贯彻执行上级的规定，每天烧火都注意为国家节约煤炭。
    这件事虽小，却使我受到很大教育。我体会到：自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，就是执行毛主席的指示；执行无产阶级革命纪律的过程，就是斗私的过程。只有自觉斗私，才能坚决执行无产阶级的革命纪律。当前，我们要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，在围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的同时，对无政府主义也要围而歼之，战而胜之。
