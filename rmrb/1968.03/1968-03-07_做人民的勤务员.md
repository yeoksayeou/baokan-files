Being a Servant of the People
A Logistics Chief of a Certain Unit, Liu Peiqing

Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, said: "A party member 'must have a certain position to be effective.' This is a blatant encouragement for party members to seek personal status.

Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Everyone should learn from Comrade White, who had no selfishness and self-seeking. From this point, one can become greatly beneficial to the people.' Chairman Mao's teachings have made me realize that a communist party member must act as a vanguard of the proletariat. The key is not in the height of one's position, but in whether one takes the three exemplary figures in 'The Three Constantly Read Articles' as models, wholeheartedly serving the people, and dedicating one's limited life to the endless service of the people. Wherever I go, I serve the people there. As long as it benefits the people, I will do it. Comrades call me a 'restless person,' saying I am a revolutionary 'old yellow cow.' To be honest, the more comrades praise me, the more uneasy I feel, thinking that I have contributed little to the party and the people. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois worldview spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, fight against selfishness, and turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul, becoming a genuine vanguard of the proletariat.

    做人民的勤务员

    中国赫鲁晓夫说什么：党员“要起作用，必须要有相当的地位。”这是明目张胆地鼓励党员争个人地位。
    毛主席教导我们：大家要学习白求恩同志“毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”毛主席的教导，使我认识到一个共产党员要起到无产阶级的先锋战士的作用，关键不在于地位的高低，而在于是不是以“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象为榜样，全心全意地为人民服务，把有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务中去。我走到那里，就服务到那里，只要对人民有益的事情我都去做。同志们称我是“闲不住的人”，说我是革命的“老黄牛”。说实在的，同志们越是夸奖，我越感到不安，觉得对党、对人民贡献很少。我们一定要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的资产阶级世界观的流毒，斗掉“私”字，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，做一个名副其实的无产阶级的先锋战士。
