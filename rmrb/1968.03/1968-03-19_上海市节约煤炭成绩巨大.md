	Shanghai's revolutionary masses have resolutely carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "promote revolution through thrift" and have made great achievements in conserving coal.

	One important measure in conserving coal is to recover as much as possible the waste gas, residual heat, and scrap fuel for use in production and daily life. This method costs little and yields great results. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary committees in various factories and enterprises are not afraid of getting dirty or tired. They recover waste gas and heat from chimneys, flues, and furnace tops, and recover waste gas and hot water from the production process to use as hot water for boilers, or to meet the living needs of the workers. Some factories even use coal slag, oil dregs, and industrial waste to replace coal for heating stoves, thus saving a lot of coal. The revolutionary masses of the Wood Processing Plant No. 1 have used the waste gas from producing fiberboard for living purposes. Not only did this solve the problem of cooking and bathing for more than 600 people in the factory, but they also actively provided living gas for a sister factory. The Daily Chemical Factory No. 4 used a large amount of coal slag and coal scraps as fuel, saving 22 percent of coal last year and increasing production by 10.6 percent.

	Another important measure in conserving coal is to reform old stoves and boilers and to improve the efficiency of boilers, furnaces, kilns, and stoves. The revolutionary masses of the New Paper Mill have reformed a "foreign boiler" that had not been touched by bourgeois technical "authorities" for more than a decade, increasing the gas output by 2.4 tons per hour and saving more than 10 percent of coal. The revolutionary workers of the Baoshan Oil Paper Factory successfully reformed a "double-core innovative stove," setting a new record for the lowest coal consumption in collective dining.

### 上海市节约煤炭成绩巨大

　　上海市节约煤炭成绩巨大
    据新华社上海电　上海市广大革命群众，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，大力节约煤炭，取得巨大成绩。
    节约煤炭的一个重要措施是尽量回收废气余热和下脚燃料，用于生产和生活。这样做花钱少，收效大。各工厂企业的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，不怕脏，不怕累，从烟囱、烟道、炉顶上回收废气废热，从生产过程中回收废气、废热水，用到锅炉作为热进水，或者用于解决职工的生活需要。有些工厂还用煤渣、油脚、工业垃圾等代替煤炭烧炉灶，节约了不少煤炭。木材加工一厂的无产阶级革命派把生产纤维板的废气用于生活，不仅解决了本厂六百多人蒸饭和洗澡用水的需要，而且主动为一个兄弟厂提供了生活用气。日用化学品四厂大量利用煤渣、煤炭下脚等作燃料，去年一年节约煤炭百分之二十二，生产增长了百分之十点六。
    革“旧炉灶”的命，造“洋锅炉”的反，提高锅、炉、窑、灶的效能，这是节约煤炭的又一个重要措施。立新造纸厂的无产阶级革命派，把一台十多年来资产阶级技术“权威”一直不敢碰的“洋锅炉”进行了大改革，使每小时产气量增加了二点四吨，节约煤炭百分之十以上。上海宝山油纸厂的革命职工，改革成功一台“双芯革新灶”，创造了集体炊事用煤最低的纪录。
