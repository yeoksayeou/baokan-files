The Vietnamese People's Army Newspaper recently published an article by a soldier named Zhan Bing, titled: "Ten Insurmountable Difficulties for the Americans." The article points out that American imperialism has fallen into a very difficult situation in the Vietnam War, facing a series of insurmountable difficulties. The American war of aggression in Vietnam is bound to suffer a thorough defeat. The following is a summary of the article:

The great victory of the people of South Vietnam during the Lunar New Year has plunged the American aggressors into a comprehensive predicament. Currently, the Americans are facing a series of insurmountable difficulties on the battlefield in South Vietnam.

1. The Americans cannot escape the passive and annihilated situation.
In this round of powerful offensive during the Lunar New Year, the people of South Vietnam have opened up new battlefields in various cities, forcing the American puppet forces to withdraw their troops back to their nests, taking a passive stance and being beaten. The people of South Vietnam are annihilating the enemy in these nests. Even Westmoreland had to admit: "The American troops are now in a defensive position."

On the entire battlefield in the South, the Americans are deeply mired in an inescapable strategic defensive situation. The American military deployment has been disrupted. The more than 1.2 million American troops (including puppet troops and mercenaries) are "like beached whales," unable to move. In reality, the American expeditionary forces have lost their strategic offensive capability.

2. The Americans cannot gather enough combat troops.
Lack of combat troops is a chronic problem for the Americans in the Vietnam War. Now, facing the comprehensive offensive launched by the people of South Vietnam, the Americans feel even more short of troops, unable to cope with the increasingly dire situation.

The American puppet troops are being annihilated more and more, and even with continuous reinforcements, the Americans cannot make up for the losses. Moreover, the Americans need to heavily guard various bases and cities. Currently, the Americans have more than 1.2 million troops (including puppet troops and mercenaries), but they still feel they do not have enough troops to defend the places they have occupied. In a situation where the Americans are extremely lacking in defensive forces, how can they have enough troops to launch an offensive? In reality, since they cannot launch an offensive, it is also impossible for them to defend.

3. In South Vietnam, the Americans have no safe ground.
Currently, there is no piece of land in South Vietnam that is a stable foothold for the Americans. The people in the mountains, countryside, and cities are all rising up to fight, putting the Americans in a situation where they are surrounded on all sides. The American aggressors' nests—the cities—have already become battlefields where the American puppet forces are being attacked. If the American puppet forces want to defend various cities, they have to abandon the countryside and mountains; but abandoning the countryside and mountains makes the cities even more dangerous.

4. The Americans cannot make up for the loss of weapons and military supplies.
The Vietnam War is like a bottomless pit, consuming a large amount of American manpower and dollars. The financial and material resources that American imperialism has consumed in Vietnam have put it in a very difficult situation. The expenses of the American war of aggression in Vietnam, despite already accounting for one-third of the American defense budget, still do not amount to much.

Even if the Americans can maintain the current production rate of weapons and military equipment, they still cannot make up for the losses they have suffered in South Vietnam. Firstly, this is because many airports and warehouses are constantly being attacked by the people of South Vietnam. Due to the fact that the American troops consume a large amount of weapons and equipment every day, the Americans cannot transport supplies in time; at the same time, the transportation lines are often cut off, making the Americans face even greater difficulties.

5. The morale of the American troops is low and they are in a state of despair.
The morale of the American aggressors is at a very serious low. According to Western news agencies, "American soldiers are afraid of everything, afraid of living on the ground, afraid of living underground, and even afraid when boarding planes to withdraw." This spiritual loophole in the American troops is expanding day by day, and even American officers are beginning to lose confidence. They are tired of this long and bloody war of "bloodshed and failure." Westmoreland, facing the defeat of the American troops, is also at a loss. Recently, Wheeler rushed to South Vietnam to boost Westmoreland's morale, which shows Westmoreland's helplessness and the failure of the Americans on the battlefield in the South.

6. The Americans cannot save the collapse of the puppet army.
Under the heavy blows of the people of South Vietnam, the puppet army is collapsing even more seriously.

The Americans have exhausted their wisdom and strength but still cannot raise a puppet army that can be relied upon. In the "special war," 500,000 puppet troops suffered defeat under the attacks of the heroic people of South Vietnam. In the "limited war," under the protection of 500,000 American troops, the collapse of the puppet army is even faster.

The puppet army is not only paralyzed and unable to rely on the Americans but sometimes becomes a dagger in the Americans' back, because more and more puppet soldiers are awakening and will turn against the Americans. The contradictions between the Americans and the puppets are becoming sharper. The American aggressors, regarding the puppet army, are both using and fearing it. This is also the difficulty that the Americans cannot solve in using the puppet army in the Vietnam War.

7. The Americans cannot save the complete collapse of the puppet regime.
Under the thunderous blows of the people of South Vietnam during the Lunar New Year offensive, in just a few days, the rural administrative organs of the American puppet forces were overthrown, and many puppet government agencies from the county and province to Saigon were dissolved or paralyzed.

The Americans need a puppet regime as a tool for their neocolonialist war of aggression. However, as American officials have admitted, the Saigon puppet regime is "too corrupt and incompetent, a nominal ally, a government that no one responds to." The Americans have tried their best to stage the farce of establishing a "parliament" and electing a "president," forcing the infighting Vietnamese traitors to come together, but the result is still in vain. The complete collapse of the Saigon puppet regime is just a matter of time.

8. The American "pacification" plan has completely failed.
The "pacification of the countryside" plan, aimed at gradually taking over the land, controlling the population, and establishing ruling organs, is one of the primary strategic tasks of the American puppet forces. Over the past decade, the Americans have exhausted their manpower and resources to implement the "pacification of the countryside" plan, but they have suffered a heavy defeat. The "strategic villages" that the Americans can barely hold on to, located near various strategic transportation lines and around military bases and towns, have now all been smashed. The people in the countryside and cities have risen up to fight, making the American puppet forces' "pacification" plan completely bankrupt.

9. The Americans cannot escape the heavy encirclement of the people's war.
The people of South Vietnam, in their coordinated and continuous attacks on various battlefields, have made the American puppet forces unable to cope. The American puppet forces cannot destroy the increasingly numerous and powerful encirclement around various bases and cities, nor can they stop the people of South Vietnam from penetrating their nests to launch attacks. The more the American puppet forces struggle, the tighter the encirclement by the people of South Vietnam becomes. The more they struggle, the more conditions the people of South Vietnam have to annihilate more of the enemy's combat forces.

10. The Americans have no effective strategy left.
The Americans are in an extremely difficult situation. Their strategic plans have been disrupted, and the "search and destroy" and "pacification" strategies have failed. The Americans' escalation of the war against the North has been smashed. Especially after the people of South Vietnam launched a powerful offensive, the Americans have found no effective strategy.

Now, the Americans are sending more troops to South Vietnam and increasing their war tools, escalating the war against North Vietnam, in an attempt to reverse the situation. However, everything the Americans are doing is just repeating ineffective measures. This is the Americans' big problem. The Americans' failure is inevitable, and they will definitely suffer a thorough defeat.

　　越南《人民军队报》发表署名战兵文章论述美帝纸老虎在南越的困境
    美国侵略者无法克服的十大困难
    新华社河内十六日电　越南《人民军队报》最近发表署名战兵的文章，题目是：《美国无法克服的十大困难》。文章指出：美帝国主义在侵越战争中已陷于十分困窘的处境，面临着一系列无法克服的困难，美帝侵越战争必定遭到彻底的失败。文章摘要如下：
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，使美国侵略者陷入了全面的困境。目前，美国在南越战场上遇到了一系列无法克服的困难。
    一、美国无法摆脱被动和被消灭的处境
    越南南方军民在这次新春强大攻势中，在各个城市开辟了新的战场，使美伪集团不得不把军队撤回到它们的巢穴里去，被动挨打。南方军民就在这些巢穴里消灭敌人。连威斯特摩兰也不得不承认：“美军已经处在防御状态”。
    在整个南方战场上，美国正在深深地陷入无法摆脱的战略防御的处境。美国的军事部署已被打乱。美国的一百二十多万军队（包括伪军和帮凶军），“象在沙滩上搁浅的鲸鱼一样”，动弹不得。实际上，美国远征军已失去了战略进攻的能力。
    二、美国无法凑集足够的战斗部队
    缺乏战斗部队，是美国在侵越战争中的痼疾。现在，面对着南方军民发动的全面进攻，美国更加感到兵力不足，没有足够的军队来应付日益危困的局势。
    美伪军被消灭得越来越多，即使美国不断地增兵，也无法弥补损失。不仅如此，美国还要有重兵防守各个基地和城市。美国目前拥有一百二十多万军队（包括伪军和帮凶军），但是仍然感到没有足够的军队守卫它所占领的地方。在美国极为缺乏防御力量的情况下，它又怎能有足够的军队用来进攻呢？实际上，既然无法发动进攻，要进行防御也是不可能的。
    三、在越南南方，美国没有一块安全之地
    目前，在越南南方，没有一块土地是美国稳定的立足之地。山区、农村和城市人民都在奋起斗争，使美国陷入四面受困的处境。美国侵略军的巢穴——城市，已经成为美伪军遭到打击的战场。美伪集团要想保卫各个城市，就要放弃农村和山区；而放弃农村和山区，城市也就更加危险。
    四、美国无法弥补武器和军事物资的损失
    越南战争象一个无底洞一样，吃掉美国大量的兵力和美元。美帝国主义在越南消耗的财力物力，已使它十分窘困。美国侵越战争的开支尽管已占美国国防预算的三分之一，但美国仍然搞不出什么名堂来。
    即使美国能够保持住武器和军事装备的现有生产率，也无法弥补它在南越遭到的损失。首先是因为许多机场和仓库不断遭到南方军民的袭击。由于美军每天都要消耗大量的武器和设备，使美国无法来得及运输补给；与此同时，交通线又经常被切断，使美国遇到更大的困难。
    五、美军士气低落，一蹶不振
    美国侵略军的士气低落已到了十分严重的程度。据西方通讯社透露：“美国士兵什么都怕，怕在地面上生活，怕在地下生活，甚至在上飞机撤走时也害怕”。美军精神上的这个漏洞日益扩大，甚至美国军官也开始失去信心，他们厌烦这场“流血和失败”的漫长的战争。威斯特摩兰面临美军的惨败，也六神无主。最近，惠勒赶到南越给威斯特摩兰打气，这表明了威斯特摩兰的无能为力和美国在南方战场上的失败。
    六、美国无法挽救伪军的瓦解
    在越南南方军民的沉重打击下，伪军正在更加严重地土崩瓦解。
    美国费尽心机和力量，仍然无法扶植起一支可作依靠的伪军。在“特种战争”中，五十万伪军在英雄的南方军民的进攻下遭到了失败。在“局部战争”中，在五十万美军的庇护下，伪军的瓦解更加迅速。
    伪军不但已经瘫痪，无法做美军的依靠，而且有时候还变成了插进美国背部的一把刀子，因为越来越多的伪军官兵正在觉醒，他们将会反戈打击美国佬。美伪之间的矛盾越来越尖锐。美国侵略者对于伪军，是既使用又害怕。这也是美国在侵越战争中在使用伪军方面所无法解决的困难。
    七、美国无法挽救伪政权的彻底垮台
    在越南南方军民新春攻势雷霆万钧般的打击下，仅在几天中，农村的美伪集团统治机构被推翻，从县、省到西贡的许多伪政权机关被瓦解或陷于瘫痪。
    美国要进行新殖民主义侵略战争，就非有一个伪政权作为它的工具不可。但是，就象美国官员所招认的那样，西贡伪政权“太腐败和无能，是一个有名无实的同盟，一个没有人响应的政府”。美国曾经竭力导演成立“国会”、选举“总统”等丑剧，竭力迫使互相倾轧的越奸走狗凑合在一处，但结果仍然是枉费心机。西贡伪政权的彻底垮台只是一个时间问题。
    八、美国“绥靖”计划已完全破产
    以蚕食土地、控制人口、建立统治机构为目的的“绥靖农村”计划，是美伪集团首要的战略任务之一。十多年来，美国倾尽人力、物力推行“绥靖农村”计划，但遭到了惨重的失败。美国要派重兵才能勉强保住的位于各条战略交通线附近和各个军事基地与城镇周围的一些“战略村”，现在也都被粉碎了。农村和城市人民的奋起斗争，已使美伪集团的“绥靖”计划彻底破产。
    九、美国无法摆脱人民战争的重重包围
    南方军民在各个战场上的配合一致和连续进攻，使美伪集团无法招架。美伪集团无法摧毁各个基地和城市周围的日益增多和日益强大的包围圈，更无法阻挡南越军民深入它们的巢穴进行袭击。美伪集团越挣扎，南方人民的包围圈就拉得越紧。它们越挣扎，南方人民就越有条件歼灭敌人更大的有生力量。
    十、美国再也没有什么“有效”的战略了
    美国已陷于极其困窘的处境。美国的战略计划已被打乱，“寻找歼灭”和“绥靖”战略已经失败。美国对北方的战争“升级”被粉碎了。尤其在南方军民发动强大攻势之后，美国更是找不到什么有效的战略了。
    现在，美国正在向越南南方增兵和增加战争工具，对越南北方进行战争“升级”，妄图挽救败局。但是，美国所做的一切，只是重复无效的措施。这就是美国的大难题。美国失败是必然的，而且美国一定要遭到彻底的失败。
