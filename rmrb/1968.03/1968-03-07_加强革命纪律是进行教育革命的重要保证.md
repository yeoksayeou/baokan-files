At a critical moment in the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in middle schools, Chairman Mao issued his brilliant March 7th instructions. Over the past year, under the guidance of these brilliant instructions, the military and political training at Beijing No. 23 Middle School has achieved significant results. Revolutionary teachers and students have further strengthened their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. The entire school quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, powerfully promoting the deepening of revolutionary criticism and the return to classes for making revolution. All of these have laid a solid foundation for further carrying out the proletarian educational revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line. Without discipline, the Party cannot lead the masses and the army to victory in struggle." Revolutionary organizational discipline is an important guarantee for us to carry out the proletarian educational revolution. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts within the revolutionary ranks are often exploited by class enemies. They use the slogan of "rebellion is justified" to incite anarchist tendencies, attempting to disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Therefore, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts within the revolutionary ranks are our major enemies in strengthening revolutionary discipline.

When we were implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions and promoting the realization of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in schools, some people came out and said that great unity is a "hodgepodge," the three-in-one combination is a "mishmash," and returning to school to make revolution is "slavery."

When we were following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carrying out revolutionary criticism, some people again came out and said that this was "detached from class struggle," "ignoring state affairs," and "not like a rebel."

When we were fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving the return to classes for making revolution, some people said that this was "revisionist reformism," "not revolution, but restoration."

In short, every time the middle school Cultural Revolution deepened to a critical moment, a small handful of people would use anarchist tendencies. They disguised themselves, used flowery language, spread rumors, and tried to scatter revolutionary discipline, disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, and obstruct the great historical tide of the proletarian educational revolution and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." During the military training, we and the broad revolutionary teachers and students worked together to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We launched one struggle after another against anarchism and lack of organization and discipline, ensuring the deepening of the proletarian educational revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Controlling ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to carry out great political struggles." For the majority of the masses influenced by anarchist thoughts, it is a matter of ideological education and eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit. Therefore, we vigorously held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study the "Old Three Articles," "Opposing Liberalism," and "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." In the study classes, we and everyone else together exposed phenomena that disrupted revolutionary discipline, discussed the harm of lack of organization and discipline, and dug out the roots of anarchist tendencies. After the study classes ended, the broad revolutionary teachers and students voluntarily formed "one helps one, one assists one," helping and educating each other, voluntarily observing discipline. Many classes in the entire school achieved the same discipline whether the PLA was present or not; the same discipline whether there was leadership or not; the same discipline inside and outside the school.

Personal example is better than preaching. Military training personnel leading by example and combining words with actions are important links in cultivating revolutionary teachers and students to observe revolutionary discipline. Chairman Mao said: "The method of sending military cadres to train revolutionary teachers and students is very good. Training makes a big difference compared to not training. This way, we can learn politics, military affairs, the Four Firsts, the Three-Eight Style, the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we brought the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the school. Whether it was for morning exercises, classes, or participating in political activities outside, we strictly followed the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention, voluntarily acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Once, on the way back from an outside activity, it started raining heavily, and our clothes were soaked. The students, following the example of the PLA, maintained orderly ranks and steps, high morale, and loud singing, returning to the school with us.

We also helped the school establish systems such as "persisting in military training, promoting the Three-Eight Style" and "requesting and approving leave." We vigorously carried out the Four Good Teams and Five Good Soldiers activities, maintaining weekly evaluations, monthly inspections, and annual summaries, discovering and promptly commending good deeds and good people.

Through repeated ideological education, the awareness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students has been raised, and organizational discipline has been strengthened. Everyone has come to realize that revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination are the fruits of the Cultural Revolution, and we must strengthen revolutionary discipline to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and safeguard the school revolutionary committee; sitting down to carry out revolutionary criticism is the glorious and arduous task given to us by Chairman Mao, and this is the proper appearance of revolutionaries; educational revolution is a great cause that previous generations have not undertaken, and we must have a united and determined fighting force to complete this glorious historical mission. Now, the entire school presents a thriving new situation, with morning exercises, classes, study and criticism, and educational reforms all proceeding in an organized and planned manner. Since the military training, the student attendance rate has been maintained at over 90%. In addition to half a day of study within the school, they also voluntarily organize themselves outside the school to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. A political situation of "having both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual comfort, lively and vibrant" is being formed.

Opposing anarchism and strengthening revolutionary organizational discipline is a long-term and complex struggle, a key issue in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, continue to do in-depth political and ideological work, and work with the broad revolutionary teachers and students to carry out ideological revolutionization. We will further implement Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions, deepen the educational revolution, and turn Beijing No. 23 Middle School into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    加强革命纪律是进行教育革命的重要保证
    北京二十三中军训团
    在中学无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的关键时刻，毛主席就发出了光辉的“三·七”指示。一年来，在这个光辉指示的指引下，二十三中的军政训练取得了很大的成绩。广大革命师生进一步加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，全校迅速地实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，有力地推动了革命大批判和复课闹革命的深入发展。所有这些，为进一步开展无产阶级教育革命奠定了良好的基础。
    毛主席教导我们：“纪律是执行路线的保证，没有纪律，党就无法率领群众与军队进行胜利的斗争。”革命的组织纪律，是我们进行无产阶级教育革命的重要保证。革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，往往为阶级敌人所利用。他们打起“造反有理”的幌子，极力煽动无政府主义思潮，妄图打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署。因此，革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，是我们加强革命纪律的大敌。
    在我们执行毛主席的“三·七”指示，推动学校实现革命大联合和革命三结合的时候，有人跑出来说大联合是“大杂烩”，三结合是“三凑合”，回到学校闹革命是“奴隶主义”。
    在我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，开展革命大批判的时候，又有人跑出来说，这是
  “脱离阶级斗争”，“不顾国家大事”，“不象造反派的样子”。
    在我们全面落实毛主席的最新指示，实现复课闹革命的时候，又有人说什么这是
  “修修补补的改良主义”，“不是革命，是复旧”。
    总之，每当中学文化大革命深入的关键时刻，总是有一小撮人利用无政府主义思潮。他们乔装打扮，花言巧语，造谣惑众，企图涣散革命纪律，瓦解革命队伍，阻挡无产阶级教育革命的伟大历史潮流，阻挡无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。军训中，我们和广大革命师生一起，努力活学活用毛主席著作，对无政府主义和无组织无纪律现象展开了一次又一次的斗争，保证了无产阶级教育革命的深入发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”对大多数受无政府主义思潮影响的群众来说，是一个思想教育、破私立公的问题。因此，我们大力举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命师生反复学习“老三篇”，学习《反对自由主义》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作。在学习班中，我们和大家一起摆破坏革命纪律的现象，论无组织无纪律的危害，挖无政府主义思潮的根源。学习班结束后，广大革命师生又自觉地结成“一帮一，一对红”，互相帮助，互相教育，自觉遵守纪律。全校许多班级都做到了解放军在和解放军不在一个样；有领导在和没有领导在一个样；校内和校外一个样。
    身教胜于言教。军训人员以身作则，言传身带，是培养革命师生遵守革命纪律的重要环节。毛主席说：“派军队干部训练革命师生的方法很好。训练一下和不训练大不一样。这样做，可以向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，把中国人民解放军的优良传统带到学校，不论是出操上课，还是外出参加政治活动，我们都坚决执行三大纪律八项注意，自觉按照毛主席的指示办事。一次，外出回来的路上，下起了大雨，衣服都淋透了，同学们坚决以解放军为榜样，保持队不散、步不乱，斗志昂扬，歌声嘹亮，和我们一起回到了学校。
    我们还帮助学校建立了“坚持军事训练，大兴三八作风”和“请销假”等项制度。大力开展四好连队、五好战士活动，坚持周评比，月检查，年总结，发现好人好事，及时加以表扬。
    通过反复的思想教育，广大革命师生的觉悟提高了，组织纪律性加强了。大家认识到，革命大联合和革命三结合是文化大革命的胜利果实，我们一定要加强革命纪律，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，维护校革命委员会；坐下来搞革命的大批判，是毛主席交给我们革命派的光荣艰巨的任务，这样做正是革命派应有的“样子”；教育革命是前人没有做过的伟大事业，必须有一支团结一致、万众一心的战斗队伍，才能完成这一光荣的历史使命。现在，全校呈现一派欣欣向荣的新气象，出操上课、学习批判、教育改革都在有组织、有计划地进行。军训以来，学生的到校率一直保持在百分之九十以上，每天除校内半天学习之外，校外也自觉地组织起来，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，一个“又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”，正在形成。
    反对无政府主义，加强革命的组织性、纪律性，是一场长期的、复杂的斗争，是全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取文化大革命全面胜利的一个关键问题。我们一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，继续作深入的政治思想工作，和广大革命师生一道搞好思想革命化，进一步贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示，深入开展教育革命，把二十三中办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
