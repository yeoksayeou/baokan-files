At a time when American imperialism is suffering heavy defeats on the battlefield in Vietnam, the pro-American and traitorous Japanese government of Sato is becoming increasingly active in serving U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam, becoming a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism.

The Sato government has provided military bases for the U.S. to expand its aggression against Vietnam, allowing U.S. B-52 bombers to take off from Japanese territory to bomb South Vietnam and massacre the South Vietnamese people. According to Japanese media reports, in February of this year, fifteen B-52 bombers stationed at the U.S. base in Okinawa took off day and night, their activities extremely frequent. Before this, the average number of B-52 bombers stationed at the U.S. air base near Tokyo was one per month. It is reported that the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" also prepared in Sasebo before sailing to South Vietnam to carry out its aggression.

At the same time, the Sato government has provided the U.S. with manpower, weapons, ammunition, napalm bombs, chemical poisons, and many other military supplies. Aircraft, warships, cannons, and tanks damaged by the heroic Vietnamese military and people in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam are repaired in Japan. According to the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun," in 1967, the U.S. purchased "special military supplies" worth seven billion dollars from Japan to invade Vietnam. This figure is close to the total amount of "special military supplies" the U.S. purchased from Japan during its aggression against Korea.

Moreover, Japan is an important logistics base for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. Most of the cannon fodder sent by the Johnson administration to Vietnam is transported through Okinawa and other Japanese bases to South Vietnam. The U.S. soldiers who are beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people are continuously transported from the Vietnam battlefield to Japan for "rest" and medical treatment, and then sent back to the Vietnam battlefield to die. The bodies of U.S. soldiers are also transported back to the U.S. through Japan. Recently, with the powerful Tet Offensive launched by the military and people of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam have suffered heavy casualties, and Japan, as a logistics base for the aggression against Vietnam, has become particularly busy. The U.S. field hospitals in and around Tokyo are all filled with American wounded from South Vietnam. Some hospitals have even placed beds in the dining rooms and clubs.

### 主子惨遭失败　奴才充当帮凶  佐藤政府加紧为美帝扩大侵越战争效劳

    主子惨遭失败　奴才充当帮凶
    佐藤政府加紧为美帝扩大侵越战争效劳
    新华社二十日讯　东京消息：正当美帝国主义在越南战场上遭到惨重失败的时候，亲美卖国的日本佐藤政府越来越卖力地为美帝侵越政策效劳，死心塌地充当美帝的忠实走卒。
    佐藤政府为美帝扩大侵越战争提供了军事基地，让美国的B—52型飞机从日本领土起飞轰炸越南南方，屠杀南越人民。据日本报刊透露，今年二月，美帝进驻冲绳基地的十五架B—52型飞机，每天不分昼夜地起飞，活动非常频繁。在这以前，东京附近的横田空军基地，平均每月都有B—52型飞机进驻。据报道，美国的核航空母舰“企业号”，也是在佐世保进行准备后驶往越南南方进行侵略活动的。
    与此同时，佐藤政府还向美帝提供人力、武器、弹药、凝固汽油弹、化学毒药和许多军用物资。美军在侵越战争中被英雄的越南军民打坏了的飞机、军舰、大炮、坦克等，运到日本修理。据日本资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》报道，一九六七年美帝从日本采购的侵略越南的“特别军需”达七亿美元。这个数字已接近美帝进行侵朝战争时在日本采购的“特别军需”总额。
    不仅如此，日本也是美帝国主义侵略越南的重要兵站基地。约翰逊政府增派的炮灰，多半是经过冲绳和其他日本基地转运到越南南方的。而被英雄的越南人民打得头破血流的美国兵，又不断地从越南战场运到日本“休养”和医治，然后再运到越南战场去送死。美国兵尸体，也是经过日本运回美国。最近，在越南南方军民发动的强大的新春攻势下，侵越美军死伤惨重，作为侵越兵站基地的日本也格外忙碌。东京市内和周围的美军野战医院都住满了来自南越的美国伤员。有的医院连食堂和俱乐部都摆满了病床。
    佐藤政府的上述种种罪恶行径表明，它是美帝扩大侵越战争的得力帮凶。紧紧地把自己绑在美帝侵略战车上的日本反动派，到头来必将落得与美帝同归于尽的悲惨下场。
