The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 23rd, stating that the Thai People's Armed Propaganda Teams are actively mobilizing and organizing the masses in the northeastern, northern, and southern regions, earning widespread support and welcome from the people.

The article states: Under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces, in addition to fighting the enemy, also send armed propaganda teams to various villages, big and small, to integrate with the people, conduct propaganda, mobilize, and organize the masses.

The article states: This work by the people's armed forces has significant political implications. It awakens the masses, helping them see through the aggressive nature of American imperialism and the treacherous acts of the Thanom-Praphas collective against the nation, recognizing the root of the people's suffering, and igniting their class hatred towards the U.S.-Thanom collective, inspiring them to join the armed struggle. It makes the masses understand that only through armed struggle can they achieve the correct path to national independence, and see their own strength, boosting their confidence in victory.

The article states: The people's armed propaganda teams do not just point out who the enemies and friends are and indicate the correct direction of struggle; they also meticulously care for the masses, enthusiastically helping them solve difficulties.

The article states: Under the propaganda and education of the people's armed propaganda teams, the class consciousness of the masses rapidly increases. They recognize that the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party are truly fighting for the interests of the nation and the people against the enemy. Wherever the people's armed propaganda teams go, they are warmly welcomed and supported by the masses. The broad masses enthusiastically prepare food for the people's armed forces, sending their children to join the people's armed ranks. Whenever the people's armed propaganda teams are about to leave the village, the masses are reluctant to part, hoping that the soldiers will come often, and expressing their determination to unite and resist the enemy.

The article states: In addition to politically striking a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries, the people's armed propaganda teams also have the task of eliminating the local reactionary forces of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries. According to incomplete statistics, in the northeastern region alone last year, the people's armed propaganda teams executed more than twenty spies and agents of the U.S.-Thanom collective.

The article states: The people's armed propaganda teams are striking the enemy heavily both politically and militarily. Therefore, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are very afraid and are trying every means to stop the influence of the people's armed propaganda teams, but their efforts are in vain.

    宣传群众　组织群众
  　武装群众泰国人民武装宣传队深受群众支持
    新华社二十四日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台二十三日广播的一篇文章指出：泰国人民武装宣传队正在东北部、北部、南部等地区广泛开展发动和组织群众的工作，获得了人民群众的广泛支持和欢迎。
    文章说：在泰国共产党正确领导下的泰国人民武装，除了同敌人打仗以外，还派遣武装宣传队深入各大小村庄，同人民群众打成一片，进行宣传、发动和组织群众。
    文章说：人民武装的这项工作具有重大的政治意义。它唤醒群众，使群众看清美帝国主义的侵略本质和他侬—巴博集团叛卖民族的罪行，认识到人民的苦难根源，激发他们对美国—他侬集团的阶级仇恨，奋起参加武装斗争。它使群众懂得只有进行武装斗争才是争取民族独立的正确道路，并看到自己的力量，增强必胜的信心。
    文章说：人民武装宣传队不单是给群众指明谁是敌人谁是朋友和指出正确的斗争方向，他们还无微不至地关心群众，热情帮助群众解决困难。
    文章说：在人民武装宣传队的宣传教育下，群众的阶级觉悟迅速提高，他们认识到泰国共产党领导下的人民武装，是真正为着民族和人民的利益而同敌人进行战斗的人民军队。人民武装宣传队所到之处，都获得群众的热烈欢迎和支持。广大群众热情地为人民武装筹备粮食，送自己的子弟参加人民武装队伍。每当人民武装宣传队要离开村庄，群众都是依依不舍，盼望子弟兵经常到来，并表示要团结起来抗击敌人。文章说：人民武装宣传队除在政治上给美泰反动派以沉重打击外，还有清除美泰反动派的地方反动势力的任务。据不完全统计，在去年，仅东北部地区，人民武装宣传队就处决了二十多名美国—他侬集团的暗探特务。
    文章说：人民武装宣传队在政治上和军事上都沉重地打击着敌人。因此，美泰反动派非常害怕，它们千方百计妄图阻止人民武装宣传队的影响，但是，它们的努力都是徒劳的。
