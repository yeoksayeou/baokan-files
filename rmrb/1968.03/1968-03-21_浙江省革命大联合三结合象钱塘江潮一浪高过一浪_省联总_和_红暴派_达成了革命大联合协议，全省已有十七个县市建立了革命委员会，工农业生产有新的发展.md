Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Zhejiang Province is extremely good.

Chairman Mao said: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, regard holding and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the key to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Currently, the province has held over 77,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 570,000 participants. In the past two months, study classes have been held in factory workshops, construction sites, fields, boats, and production teams. Many workers and poor and lower-middle peasants' families have also held study classes. The cities and countryside of the entire province have become large classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Many regions, counties and cities, factories, and schools have recently held meetings to exchange experiences in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes and conferences of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, summarizing and exchanging the achievements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the experiences of holding good study classes.

The proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres participating in the study classes in various places have a single-minded loyalty to the great teacher of the proletariat Chairman Mao, and they grasp the application of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They seriously implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, making the waves of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary three-in-one combination surge forward like the tides of the Qiantang River, one wave higher than the next.

Currently, 67 counties and cities in the province have mostly achieved revolutionary great alliance or reached agreements on revolutionary great alliance. In Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Shaoxing, and other regions, more than 80% of the grassroots units have achieved revolutionary great alliance. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the "Provincial Revolutionary Alliance" and the "Red Storm Faction" in Zhejiang Province have reached an agreement on revolutionary great alliance based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of achieving revolutionary great alliance, both sides, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "both sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each side should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences," have conducted self-criticism and launched a "people's war" to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit. They think about revolutionary great alliance and act for revolutionary great alliance, thus greatly accelerating the pace of revolutionary great alliance. Thirteen colleges and universities in the province have already achieved revolutionary great alliance or reached agreements on revolutionary great alliance.

The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, enthusiastically helping cadres to correctly handle relations with the masses and correctly handle themselves, bravely coming out to participate in the revolution, greatly promoting the development and consolidation of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Currently, 17 counties and cities in the province have established revolutionary committees. In Hangzhou, more than 200 large and medium-sized factories and enterprises in the entire city have mostly established revolutionary committees.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution continues to deepen, industrial and agricultural production in the province has seen new developments, with smooth transportation and bustling markets.

Now, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in Zhejiang Province, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the province to a new stage and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    浙江省革命大联合三结合象钱塘江潮一浪高过一浪
    “省联总”和“红暴派”达成了革命大联合协议，全省已有十七个县市建立了革命委员会，工农业生产有新的发展
    新华社杭州二十日电  在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，浙江省无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势空前大好。
    毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”浙江省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，作为落实毛主席最新指示的关键。目前，全省城乡已经举办了七万七千多期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达五百七十多万人次。近两个月来，学习班已办到工厂班组、工地、田头、船头和生产队，许多工人、贫下中农的家庭也办了学习班。全省的城镇、农村，到处成为活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。许多地区、县市和工厂、学校，最近召开了毛泽东思想学习班经验交流会、学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，总结交流大学大用毛主席最新指示的成果和办好学习班的经验。
    参加各地毛泽东思想学习班学习的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合的巨浪，有如钱塘江潮，一浪高过一浪，滚滚向前。
    目前，全省六十七个县市，大部分实现了革命大联合或达成革命大联合协议。杭州、嘉兴、金华、绍兴等地区实现革命大联合的基层单位已达到百分之八十以上。在毛主席最新指示的指引下，浙江省“省联总”和“红暴派”在毛泽东思想的原则基础上达成了革命大联合的协议。在实现革命大联合的过程中，双方根据毛主席关于“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，各自进行了自我批评，展开了围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，增强了无产阶级党性。他们心往革命大联合上想，事往革命大联合上做，因而使革命大联合的步伐大大加快。全省十三所大专院校，已有八所实现了革命大联合或者达成了革命大联合的协议。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众认真学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，热情地帮助干部用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命，大大促进了革命三结合的发展和巩固。
    目前，全省已有十七个县市建立了革命委员会。杭州全市二百多个大中型工厂企业，大部分成立了革命委员会。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的不断深入发展，全省工农业生产有了新的发展，交通畅通，市场繁荣。
    现在，浙江省广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，决心把全省无产阶级文化大革命推向新阶段，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
