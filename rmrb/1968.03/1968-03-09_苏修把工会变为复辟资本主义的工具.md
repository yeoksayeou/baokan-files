The recent Soviet revisionist trade union's Fourteenth Congress ended in a cacophony of noise. The Soviet revisionist leaders, Brezhnev and Kosygin, personally attended to boost morale. They shamelessly boasted that the Soviet revisionist trade unions are "trade unions that follow Lenin's teachings," claiming that the Soviet revisionist trade unions regard "serving Lenin's cause as the entire ideal and purpose of their activities and struggles." In reality, these nauseating self-praise is merely a cover-up. The grim reality of the Soviet Union today has already exposed the lies of this bunch of traitors.

The great Lenin made many brilliant statements and teachings on the establishment and development of Soviet trade unions. As early as the initial period of the October Revolution's victory, Lenin clearly pointed out that trade unions under the dictatorship of the proletariat should be "schools of communism." Based on Lenin's teachings, trade unions should vigorously instill Marxism-Leninism in workers, cultivate new communist people, and struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. However, under the control of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the Soviet revisionist trade unions have long since completely betrayed Lenin's teachings and degenerated into tools for the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to fully restore capitalism and implement fascist rule.

The heads of the Soviet revisionist trade unions, under the banner of "schools of communism," shout about how one of the important tasks of trade unions is to educate workers and Soviet youth with an uncompromising spirit against bourgeois ideology and the capitalist remnants in people's consciousness. In reality, what they do is to instill bourgeois ideas and Western lifestyles into the working masses. Opening the Soviet revisionist trade union publications, one finds page after page of propaganda for bourgeois pacifism, humanism, and the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Particularly despicable is their poisoning of workers with bourgeois individualism and materialism, advocating that "everything is for people, everything is for people's welfare," that "rubles decide everything," that "rubles are powerful locomotives," and even shouting that pursuing personal happiness is the highest ideal of life, while the sublime spirit of serving the people is called "completely hypocritical." In short, laboring for rubles has replaced laboring for communism, and everything for private interests has replaced everything for the public. The communist moral standards personally cultivated by Lenin and Stalin are increasingly drowned in the smog of individualism.

The heads of the Soviet revisionist trade unions, using the name of "schools of communism," falsely claim that they are attracting workers to "build communism," which is merely a cover for their crimes of restoring capitalism. Currently, the Soviet revisionist clique is vigorously pushing the "new economic system" in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises, replacing socialist planned economy and the principle of distribution according to work with capitalist profit rules and free competition. In implementing this revisionist measure, the heads of the Soviet revisionist trade unions have acted as vanguards. At the Fourteenth Congress of the Soviet Trade Unions, the head of the Soviet revisionist trade unions, Shelepin, shouted hoarsely that "the work of implementing the principles of economic reform should become the main content of socialist competition." The "main content of socialist competition" that Shelepin talks about is to set up various types of "bonuses," making profit the main indicator of "socialist" competition, to strengthen "material incentives" for workers. In a bed factory in Moscow, a huge "calculation center" consisting of 125 technical personnel and economists was established to report to workers every day how much money each person earned the previous day, "stimulating" workers to work hard for a few more rubles.

The "new economic system" has brought endless disasters to the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union, further degenerating socialist state-owned enterprises into property of the bourgeois privileged class. The socialist economy personally created by Lenin and Stalin is drowned in the muddy waters of capitalist competition and the pursuit of profits. Where is this "serving Lenin's cause"? This is a complete and utter betrayal of Lenin's cause.

The heads of the Soviet revisionist trade unions also use various propaganda platforms of the trade unions to vigorously promote decadent Western culture and lifestyles. In workers' cultural palaces and clubs, yellow and reactionary films and plays, jazz music and twist dancing, run rampant. Some cultural palaces in Moscow even have "girls' clubs" to attract young female workers to study "secrets of beauty" and "problems of love." Where is this "following Lenin's teachings"? It is completely the corruption of workers' souls with bourgeois ideas, making them forget the revolution, forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve the goal of the Soviet revisionist clique to restore capitalism and consolidate their bourgeois rule.

The heads of the Soviet revisionist trade unions, under the sign of "schools of communism," hypocritically proclaim that they are "protecting the immediate interests of workers," shouting about how "the focus of the trade unions should always be on people." However, what they care about is not the interests of the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they, for the interests of the bourgeois privileged class, are tightening the exploitation of the laboring people. This bunch of traitors passed the so-called "resolution to strengthen labor discipline" to forcibly implement a series of measures to restore capitalism. They, regardless of workers' health and lives, arbitrarily support administrative responsible persons to work overtime and violate safety technical regulations, and even collude with factory managers and directors to arbitrarily punish workers, deduct wages and bonuses, and unjustly persecute and dismiss workers. They also often collude with administrative responsible persons, using the factory's "comrade trial court" under the pretext of violating labor discipline, to retaliate against some workers who are dissatisfied with the status quo, lightly fining and demoting, and heavily expelling from the factory. They turn the "comrade trial court" into a bourgeois "court" to suppress workers. Where is this "following Lenin's teachings"? It is purely the implementation of fascist dictatorship over workers.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The broad masses of the people, the broad Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good, they want revolution, and the rule of revisionism will not last long." The Soviet workers and the broad trade union cadres who grew up under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They will not allow a small handful of new traitors to ride on their heads for long. They are taking various forms of struggle. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they will surely sweep this small handful of new traitors into the dustbin of history, rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat, and make the Soviet trade unions return to the track of Lenin's teachings, making the Soviet Union return to the bright path of socialism.

    苏修把工会变为复辟资本主义的工具
    巩辉文
    最近，苏修集团召开的苏联工会第十四次代表大会，在一片吵嚷声中收场了。苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流曾亲自到会，捧场打气。他们厚颜无耻地吹嘘苏修工会是“遵循列宁遗训的工会”，胡说什么苏修工会把“为列宁的事业服务看成是自己活动和斗争的全部理想和目的”。其实，这些令人作呕的自我吹嘘，只不过是欲盖弥彰。今天苏联的严峻现实早已戳穿了这伙工贼的谎言。
    伟大的列宁对苏联工会的建立和发展曾经作过许多英明的论述和教导。早在十月革命胜利的初期，列宁就明确指出，无产阶级专政下的工会，应该是“共产主义的学校”。根据列宁的这一教导，工会应该向工人大力灌输马克思列宁主义，培养共产主义新人，为巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟而斗争。但是，在苏修叛徒集团操纵下的苏修工会，早就彻底背叛了列宁的教导，堕落成为苏修叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义、实行法西斯统治的工具。
    苏修工会头子们打着“共产主义学校”的旗号，叫嚷什么工会的一项重要任务是，以对资产阶级意识形态和人们意识中的资本主义残余不妥协的精神教育职工和苏联青年。实际上，他们干的，却是向工人群众灌输资产阶级思想和西方生活方式。打开苏修工会报刊，连篇累牍宣传的是资产阶级的和平主义、人性论、阶级斗争熄灭论……。尤其可恶的是，他们用资产阶级利己主义和拜金主义毒害工人，鼓吹什么“一切为了人，一切为了人的福利”，什么“卢布决定一切”，“卢布是强大的火车头”，甚至叫嚷什么追求个人幸福是生活的最高理想，而为人民服务的崇高精神却被说成是“彻头彻尾虚伪的”。总之，为卢布而劳动代替了为共产主义而劳动，一切为私代替了一切为公。列宁和斯大林亲手培养起来的共产主义道德风尚，日益被淹没在利己主义的乌烟瘴气之中。
    苏修工会头子们盗用“共产主义学校”的名义，胡说什么他们是在吸引工人“建设共产主义”，这只不过是他们用来掩盖复辟资本主义罪行的遮羞布。目前，苏修集团在苏联工矿企业中加紧全面推行“经济新体制”，用资本主义的利润法则和自由竞争代替社会主义计划经济和按劳分配的原则。在推行这一修正主义措施中，苏修工会头子们充当了急先锋。在苏联工会十四次代表大会上，苏修工会头子谢列平声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么：“实现经济改革原则的工作应当成为社会主义竞赛的主要内容。”谢列平所说的“社会主义竞赛的主要内容”，就是设置名目繁多的“奖金”，把利润定为“社会主义”竞赛的主要指标，以加强对工人的“物质刺激”。在莫斯科一家铁床工厂里，竟然设立了一个由一百二十五名技术人员和经济学家组成的庞大的“计算中心”，每天向工人报告每人前一天挣了多少钱，“刺激”工人为多得几个卢布而卖命。
      “经济新体制”给苏联广大劳动人民带来了无穷的灾难，使社会主义全民所有制的企业，进一步蜕化成为资产阶级特权阶层所有。列宁和斯大林亲手缔造的社会主义经济淹没在资本主义竞争和追逐利润的污泥浊水之中。这那里是什么“为列宁的事业服务”，这是彻头彻尾地对列宁事业的可耻背叛。
    苏修工会头子们还利用工会各种宣传阵地大肆推销腐朽的西方文化和生活方式。在工人文化宫和俱乐部里，黄色的、反动的电影和戏剧，爵士音乐和扭摆舞，泛滥成灾。莫斯科的一些文化宫里还设有什么“姑娘俱乐部”，吸引青年女工去研究“美容的秘密”和“爱情的问题”。这一切，那里是什么“遵循列宁遗训”？完全是用资产阶级思想腐蚀工人的灵魂，使他们忘掉革命，忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，以达到苏修集团复辟资本主义和巩固其资产阶级统治的目的。
    苏修工会的头子们挂着“共产主义学校”的招牌，虚伪地宣扬他们是“维护工人切身利益”的，叫嚷什么“始终应作为工会注意中心的是人”。但是，他们所关心的根本不是苏联广大劳动人民的利益，相反，他们却为了资产阶级特权阶层的利益，加紧对劳动人民进行压榨。这伙工贼通过了所谓加强劳动纪律的“决议”，用来强制推行复辟资本主义的一整套措施。他们不顾工人的健康和死活，随意支持行政负责人加班加点和违反安全技术条例，甚至还勾结厂长、经理肆意处罚工人，克扣工资和奖金，无故迫害和解雇工人。他们还常常伙同行政负责人，以违反劳动纪律为名，利用工厂里的“同志审判会”，对一些不满现状的工人进行打击报复，轻则罚款、降职，重则开除出厂。他们把“同志审判会”变成他们用来对付工人的资产阶级“法庭”。这那里是什么“遵循列宁遗训”，纯粹是对工人实行法西斯专政。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”在列宁和斯大林教导下成长起来的苏联工人和广大工会干部，是具有光荣革命传统的。他们绝不会让一小撮新工贼长期骑在自己的头上。他们正在采取各种方式进行斗争。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，他们一定会把这一小撮新工贼扫进历史的垃圾堆，重建无产阶级专政，使苏联工会重新沿着列宁遗训的轨道前进，使苏联重新走上社会主义的光明大道。
