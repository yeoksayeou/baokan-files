With the step-by-step implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province is getting better and better. Now, out of the twelve prefectures and municipalities directly under the province, seven prefectures and cities, including Changsha, Zhuzhou, Shaoyang, Chenzhou, Yiyang, Yueyang, and Changde, have established revolutionary committees. Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Xiangtan Prefecture, and Qianyang Prefecture have established revolutionary committee preparatory groups or leading groups. Out of the 93 counties (cities) in the province, 31 have established revolutionary committees, and 13 have established revolutionary committee preparatory groups.

Since last autumn, the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in various places of Hunan Province have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The province has seen a high tide of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Many prefectures, cities, and counties have held workers', peasants', and red guards' congresses, achieving revolutionary unity by system, by industry, and by class.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation in one's own unit. This issue must be resolved." The revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in various places of Hunan Province follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, using Mao Zedong Thought to comprehensively and historically examine cadres, distinguishing between enemy and internal contradictions, and enthusiastically helping and supporting revolutionary cadres to stand up and revolutionize. The effective method used by various places to help cadres stand up is to organize cadres to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, together with revolutionary masses to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," so that cadres can correctly handle relations with the masses and correctly handle themselves, inspiring them to seriously criticize and repudiate revisionism, break with the self and establish the public, and transform their worldview. Some leading cadres who have made mistakes, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the patient help of revolutionary masses, have greatly improved their class consciousness and line struggle consciousness, voluntarily checking and correcting their mistakes, bravely standing up and revolutionizing. The Yueyang area has held multiple sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes since last October, with most leading cadres at various levels participating in the study. Therefore, by the time the revolutionary committee was established, 70% of the county committee members and above in the entire area had stood up to work. Due to the emergence of a large number of cadres in Changsha City, 80% of the grassroots units have established or are in the process of establishing temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The first county in the province to establish a revolutionary committee is Zhuzhou County. According to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, it has achieved good experience in solving the cadre issue. The original first secretary of the county committee executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the active help of the proletarian revolutionary masses, he timely checked and corrected his mistakes, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and gained the trust of the broad revolutionary masses, being elected as the chairman of the county revolutionary committee. He has repeatedly used his own mistakes and determination to correct mistakes in Mao Zedong Thought study classes and cadre meetings at various levels, using his personal experience to inspire cadres to recall and compare, remember bitterness and think sweetly, improve class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, forever becoming loyal soldiers of Chairman Mao. Under his help, many cadres have criticized and repudiated revisionism, broken with the self and established the public, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in thought and action. Now, 97% of the main leading cadres at the county, district, and commune levels in this county have stood up to work, and more than 90% of the grassroots units have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups. Most units have the original first-in-command taking the main leading position in the temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Since the establishment of revolutionary committees in various places in Hunan Province, they have shown tremendous vitality, becoming the core of uniting the broad revolutionary masses to execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, promoting the vigorous development of the revolution and production.

The earliest city in the province to establish a revolutionary committee is Zhuzhou City. Most industrial and mining enterprises and grassroots units have achieved revolutionary unity, established revolutionary committees, and the mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought has been more widely and deeply carried out throughout the city. The revolutionary big criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of various units are actively proceeding, and production is thriving. After the establishment of revolutionary committees in Shaoyang, Yueyang, and Chenzhou prefectures, a new high tide of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes has been launched, with more than a million participants. The broad revolutionary masses have further implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent. After the establishment of revolutionary committees in many prefectures and counties and cities, various work has been strongly led, promoting the victorious development of the revolution and production.

　　湖南省各地各级革命委员会纷纷成立
    革委会一经诞生，立即显示出强大生命力，成为团结广大革命群众执行和捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心，推动了革命和生产的蓬勃发展
    新华社长沙十二日电　随着毛主席最新指示的步步落实，湖南省各地无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。现在，全省十二个专区和省辖市，已有长沙、株洲、邵阳、郴州、益阳、岳阳、常德等七个专区和市成立了革命委员会，湘西土家族苗族自治州、湘潭专区、黔阳专区成立了革命委员会筹备小组或领导小组。全省九十三个县（市），已有三十一个成立了革命委员会，十三个成立了革命委员会筹备小组。
    去年秋季以来，湖南省各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，认真贯彻毛主席一系列最新指示，全省出现了革命大联合和革命三结合的高潮。许多专区、市、县先后召开了工代会、农代会、红代会，实现了按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”湖南省各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众遵循毛主席的伟大教导，用毛泽东思想来全面地、历史地考察干部，区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，热情地帮助和支持革命干部站出来革命。各地帮助干部站出来的有效办法是组织干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，和革命群众一起认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，使干部用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众、正确地对待自己，启发他们认真斗私批修，破私立公，改造世界观。一些犯过错误的领导干部，在毛主席的最新指示的指引下，在革命群众的耐心帮助下，阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，自觉地检讨和改正错误，勇敢地站出来革命。岳阳地区从去年十月以来，连续举办了多期毛泽东思想学习班，各级领导干部大都参加了学习。因此，到成立革命委员会时，全区县委委员以上的领导干部已有百分之七十站出来工作。长沙市由于大批的干部站出来，百分之八十的基层单位已经建立或正在建立革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    全省第一个成立县革命委员会的株洲县，按照毛主席的干部政策，在解决干部问题上，取得了很好的经验。这个县的原县委第一书记，在无产阶级文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线。他在无产阶级革命派的积极帮助下，及时检查和改正了错误，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，获得广大革命群众的信任，当选为县革命委员会主任。他多次在毛泽东思想学习班里和各级干部会上，用自己犯错误的教训和改正错误的决心，现身说法，启发干部们回忆对比、忆苦思甜，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，永远做毛主席的忠诚战士。不少干部在他的帮助下，斗私批修，破私立公，很快从思想上、行动上回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在，这个县有百分之九十七的县、区、社的主要领导干部站出来工作，百分之九十以上的基层单位建立了革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组，大部分单位由原来的第一把手担任革命三结合临时权力机构中的主要领导工作。
    湖南省各地的革命委员会一经建立，立即显示出无比强大的生命力，成为团结广大革命群众执行和捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心，推动了革命和生产蓬蓬勃勃向前发展。
    全省最早成立革命委员会的株洲市，绝大多数工矿企业和基层单位已实现了革命的大联合，成立了革命委员会，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动在全市更加广泛、深入地开展，革命的大批判和各单位的斗、批、改正在积极进行，生产蒸蒸日上。邵阳、岳阳、郴州三个专区在建立革命委员会以后，进一步掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮，参加学习的有一百多万人，广大革命群众进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，革命、生产形势一片大好。许多专区和县市成立革命委员会以后，有力地加强了各项工作的领导，推动了革命和生产的胜利发展。
