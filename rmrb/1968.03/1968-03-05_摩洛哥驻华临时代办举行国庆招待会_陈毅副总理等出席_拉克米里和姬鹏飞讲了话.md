Moroccan Chargé d'Affaires Holds National Day Reception
Chen Yi, Vice Premier, Attends; Lakhmiri and Qi Pengfei Speak

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) — The Chargé d'Affaires of the Moroccan Embassy in China, Lakhmiri, held a reception tonight to celebrate Morocco's National Day.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and other relevant officials attended the reception at the invitation.

Lakhmiri, the Chargé d'Affaires, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei both spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Lakhmiri said, "We are pleased to see that Morocco and the People's Republic of China, these two friendly countries, are willing to develop their long-standing relations based on mutual respect and understanding, especially in trade. We sincerely hope that the friendship that binds us will be strengthened."

He said, "As a member of the Arab League, Morocco appreciates the stance and support of the Chinese government and people for Palestine."

The Chargé d'Affaires also introduced Morocco's construction efforts and its non-aligned foreign policy.

Qi Pengfei said in his speech, "The peoples of China and Morocco have always sympathized with and supported each other in their struggles for and defense of national independence. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Morocco, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, striving to maintain and promote friendly relations between our two countries."

Qi Pengfei said, "The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: 'The just struggles of all the peoples of the world are mutually supportive.' We believe that continuously strengthening the friendship and unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa, and developing friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries, is in the common interest of the peoples of Asia and Africa. We, the peoples of Asian and African countries, must be highly vigilant, strengthen our unity, and strengthen our friendly cooperation to thoroughly frustrate the conspiracies of imperialists and colonialists."

Qi Pengfei said, "After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will more powerfully support the just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world and make greater contributions to the common cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

Also present at the reception were diplomats from various countries accredited to China.
