Title: On Protracted War
Author: Mao Zedong
Date: 1968-03-18
Edition: 4

The foundation of the army lies with the soldiers. Without the infusion of progressive political spirit into the army, and without progressive political work to carry out this infusion, it is impossible to achieve genuine unity between officers and soldiers. It is also impossible to arouse the maximum war enthusiasm among officers and soldiers. Without this, all technical and tactical measures cannot be effectively implemented to achieve their full potential.

　　军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。
　　毛泽东《论持久战》
