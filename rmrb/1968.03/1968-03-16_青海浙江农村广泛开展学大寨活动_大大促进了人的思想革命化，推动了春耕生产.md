	Qinghai and Zhejiang Rural Areas Widely Launch the "Learn from Dazhai" Campaign, Greatly Promoting Thought Revolutionization and Boosting Spring Ploughing Production

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Qinghai Province: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Qinghai Province, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, are actively launching the mass movement of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai." This has greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts and the current spring ploughing production.

	Qinghai Province recently held a "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai" conference. After the conference, many communes and production brigades promptly conveyed the conference spirit and introduced the situation of visiting Dazhai, vigorously publicizing the Dazhai spirit and the great significance of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai." The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places, after hearing the conveyance, were deeply moved by Dazhai's revolutionary spirit. They said, Dazhai is a red flag personally set up by Chairman Mao. We must follow the bright path of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai" indicated by Chairman Mao and learn from the heroic Dazhai. Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai who hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, have limitless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

	Through the publicity of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have further clarified the direction of advancement: they must emphasize politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide agricultural production, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their world outlook, farm for the revolution, and like Dazhai, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and build socialist new rural areas. The launch of the mass movement of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai" has also further promoted the thought revolutionization of grassroots cadres. Many grassroots cadres, under the inspiration of Dazhai spirit, have significantly improved their ideological awareness and expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Chen Yonggui, firmly be good cadres, and implement the Dazhai spirit well. The vice-brigade leader of Caojiabu Brigade, Gaozhai Commune, Mutuo Autonomous County, Xia Tiande, once did not want to be a cadre. After studying in the study class and personally visiting Dazhai, he realized that being a cadre is to seize power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, not for oneself. He decided to be a revolutionary old yellow cow for life, bravely shoulder the two heavy burdens of revolution and production.

	Learning from Dazhai, following the Dazhai path, and doing a good job in spring ploughing production with Dazhai's revolutionary spirit have quickly become the conscious actions of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. Many communes and brigades have conducted a thorough check on this year's spring ploughing work, using Dazhai spirit to grasp revolution and vigorously promote various spring ploughing tasks.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: In the situation of fully implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a vigorous wave of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai" has swept across the rural areas of Zhejiang Province.

	At the end of last year, the provincial provisional power organ held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to visit Dazhai. After returning from the visit to Dazhai Brigade, it immediately vigorously publicized Chairman Mao's great call of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai" throughout the province. Many places held reporting meetings, radio meetings, and oath-taking rallies to publicize the Dazhai spirit and introduce Dazhai experiences, quickly launching the mass movement of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai." Shaoxing region and counties such as Xinchang, Shangyu, and Jinhua all held oath-taking rallies. The representatives attending the oath-taking rallies said: Chairman Mao instructs us to do so. Whether to learn the Dazhai spirit and follow the Dazhai path is a fundamental attitude issue of whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must seriously and honestly learn and master the Dazhai spirit. Various places also generally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions and train Dazhai learning cadres.

	At present, the mass movement of learning from Dazhai is further developing in various places across the province, powerfully promoting the thought revolutionization of the broad masses of cadres and commune members, and greatly boosting the current spring ploughing production.

　　青海浙江农村广泛开展学大寨活动
    大大促进了人的思想革命化，推动了春耕生产
    据新华社西宁电　青海省广大贫下中农和革命干部，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，积极开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，大大促进了人的思想革命化和当前的备耕生产。
    青海省不久以前召开了“农业学大寨”会议。会后，许多社、队都及时传达了会议精神及参观大寨情况的介绍，大力宣传大寨精神和“农业学大寨”的重大意义。各地贫下中农社员和革命干部听了传达，都深深被大寨的革命精神所感动。他们说，大寨是毛主席亲自树立的一面红旗，我们一定要沿着毛主席指引的“农业学大寨”的光辉道路前进，向英雄的大寨学习。学习大寨贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取革命、生产的更大胜利。
    通过宣传“农业学大寨”，广大贫下中农及革命干部进一步明确了前进的方向：必须突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅农业生产，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，为革命种田，象大寨那样发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，建设社会主义新农村。开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，也进一步促进了基层干部的思想革命化。很多基层干部在大寨精神的鼓舞下，思想觉悟有很大的提高，表示要向陈永贵同志学习，坚决当好干部，把大寨精神贯彻好。互助土族自治县高寨公社曹家堡大队副大队长解统德一度不想当干部，经过在学习班学习和亲自到大寨参观后，认识到当干部是为贫下中农掌权，不是为了自己，决心当一辈子革命的老黄牛，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    向大寨学习，走大寨道路，以大寨的革命精神搞好春耕生产，迅速成为广大贫下中农和革命干部的自觉行动。很多社、队对今年的备耕工作进行了一次大检查，用大寨精神狠抓革命，猛促各项备耕工作。
    据新华社杭州电　在全面落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，浙江省广大农村掀起了轰轰烈烈的“农业学大寨”的热潮。
    去年年底，省临时权力机构举办的赴大寨毛泽东思想学习班，从大寨大队参观学习回来以后，立即在全省范围内大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，许多地方召开报告会、广播会、誓师大会，宣传大寨精神，介绍大寨经验，使“农业学大寨”的群众运动迅速开展起来。绍兴地区以及新昌、上虞、金华等县，都召开了誓师大会。参加誓师大会的代表们说：毛主席指示我照办。学不学大寨精神，走不走大寨道路，这是忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的根本态度问题，我们一定要认真地、老老实实地学，把大寨精神学到手。各地还普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示，训练学大寨的骨干。
    目前，学大寨的群众运动正在全省各地进一步深入展开，有力地促进了广大干部和社员的思想革命化，大大地推动了当前的备耕生产。
