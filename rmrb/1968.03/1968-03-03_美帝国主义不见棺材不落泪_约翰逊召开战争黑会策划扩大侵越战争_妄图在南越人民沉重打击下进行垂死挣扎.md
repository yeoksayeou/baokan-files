In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people's fierce Tet Offensive, the shaken U.S. imperialist head Johnson convened a war meeting on February 28 with his main military and political subordinates in the White House to plot a more frenzied expansion of the Vietnam War, desperately struggling to survive under the heavy blows from the people of South Vietnam.

On the day before this war meeting, Johnson himself took to the stage at a public gathering to loudly advocate for war, preparing public opinion for the U.S. imperialists' new military adventure. In his speech, he lamented that the U.S. war in Vietnam is "a long road ahead," while emphasizing that the U.S. "will not waver" and that the American people must continue to "shed blood, sweat, and tears" for the Vietnam War.

Johnson's speech shows that the U.S. imperialists won't give up until they see the coffin, determined to persist in their reckless actions in Vietnam.

General Wheeler, who had just returned from a "visit" to South Vietnam, reported on his findings at the meeting. According to reports, the meeting not only discussed the "entire situation in Vietnam" but also spent a long time discussing the situation in Laos. Although the content of Wheeler's report was not released, according to Western news agencies, the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, suggested to Wheeler that in addition to the current limit of 525,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, another 50,000 to 100,000 troops should be sent to South Vietnam. For the U.S. aggressors, who are in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war, an additional 50,000 to 100,000 troops is like a drop in the bucket, utterly futile.

No matter how many more cannon fodder the U.S. imperialists send, they cannot escape their predicament. For the Johnson administration, which is facing a depleted reserve and a shortage of manpower, gathering such a batch of cannon fodder is fraught with difficulties. Moreover, according to Agence France-Presse, Senator Russell, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, predicted on February 27 that Johnson would have to call up reservists to fill the gaps caused by sending troops to Vietnam.

To strengthen and expand the Vietnam War and make a desperate struggle, in addition to his activities in South Vietnam, Wheeler also went to Thailand, an important U.S. military base in Southeast Asia, to engage in conspiratorial activities. In his public statements during his time in Southeast Asia and after his return, he had to admit that the U.S. aggressors were on the defensive in South Vietnam, in a miserable situation, and that the South Vietnamese people had the initiative on the battlefield and possessed "tactical flexibility." At the same time, he boasted that "the U.S. has decided to continue this (Vietnam) war," and Johnson would provide "any troops needed to expand the Vietnam War."

Wheeler and others' boasts show that the unrepentant U.S. imperialists, unwilling to accept their defeat, are plotting new military adventures, scheming to expand the Vietnam War to Laos and other places. Wheeler, upon his return to Washington on February 28, brazenly declared that the situation in Laos was "troubling," and "we will have to consider it."

The same day, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey also told reporters that U.S. military aircraft invading Laos "reserve the right to retaliate when fired upon," and that the U.S. would implement so-called "armed escorts" when "necessary." The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, also insidiously said on February 25 in an interview with the Associated Press that "the southeastern part of Laos has long been used as an important transportation line for transporting personnel, weapons, ammunition, and supplies."

Republican Senator Hartfield said in the Senate on February 28 that various signs indicate that the Johnson administration is seriously considering expanding the ground war outside South Vietnam.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Any military adventure and political deception by U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure." The desperate struggles of the U.S. imperialists, who have been beaten to a standstill by the Vietnamese people, can only hasten their complete failure.

Facing the unprecedented predicament of the U.S. imperialists, even American bourgeois newspapers cannot help but worry about the prospects of the U.S. expanding the Vietnam War. The Wall Street Journal, a mouthpiece of U.S. monopolies, lamented on February 24 in an article: "The entire (aggression in) Vietnam effort may be doomed to failure." The defeat of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam is already sealed. The heroic Vietnamese people, who insist on a protracted struggle, will surely win the final victory in the war against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

    美帝国主义不见棺材不落泪
    约翰逊召开战争黑会策划扩大侵越战争
    妄图在南越人民沉重打击下进行垂死挣扎
    新华社二十九日讯华盛顿消息：在英雄的越南南方军民凌厉的新春攻势的沉重打击下，惊魂未定的美帝头子约翰逊，二月二十八日纠集他手下的主要军政头目，在白宫举行了一次战争黑会，策划更疯狂地扩大侵越战争，进行垂死挣扎。
    在这次战争黑会召开的前一天，约翰逊亲自出马在一次公众集会上大肆进行战争叫嚣，为美帝新的军事冒险准备舆论。他在讲话中一面哀叹美国的侵越战争“前面的道路是漫长的”；一面又强调美国“决不会动摇”，要美国人民继续为侵越战争“流血、流汗和流泪”。
    约翰逊的讲话表明美帝国主义不见棺材不落泪，要在越南蛮干下去。
    刚从南越“视察”后回到华盛顿的美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒，在黑会上就“视察”结果作了“汇报”。据报道，会上不但讨论了“整个越南局势”，而且老挝局势也是“长时间讨论的问题”。惠勒的“汇报”内容虽然没有发表，但是，据西方通讯社透露，侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰要求惠勒向约翰逊建议，在目前的侵越美军限额五十二万五千人之外，再向南越增派美军五万人到十万人。对于处在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中的美国侵略者来说，区区五万到十万兵力，无异于杯水车薪，无济于事。
    美帝不管再增加多少炮灰，也无法使它摆脱困境。而对于处在后备枯竭、兵源困窘的约翰逊政府来说，搜罗这样一批炮灰更是困难重重。此外，据法新社报道，美国参议院军事委员会主席拉塞尔二十七日预计，约翰逊将不得不征召预备役人员以填补由于派部队到越南所造成的空缺。
    为了强化和扩大侵越战争，进行疯狂的挣扎，惠勒除了到南越活动以外，还跑到美国在东南亚的重要侵略基地泰国进行了阴谋活动。他在东南亚期间以及回国后多次发表的公开言论中，不得不承认美国侵略军在南越战场上被动挨打，处境狼狈，南方军民掌握战场主动权和具有“战术上的灵活性”；同时还叫嚷，“美国决定继续这场（侵越）战争”，约翰逊将提供扩大侵越战争“所需要的任何军队”。
    惠勒等人的叫嚣表明，贼心不死的美帝国主义，不甘心于它的失败，正在策划新的军事冒险，阴谋把侵越战争扩大到老挝和其它地方。惠勒在二十八日返抵华盛顿时扬言老挝局势是“令人不安的”，“我们将不得不加以考虑”。
    美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基同一天也对新闻记者声称，侵略老挝的美国军用飞机“保留在遇到射击时进行还击的权利”，美国在“必要”时要实行所谓“武装护航”。侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰在二十五日答美联社记者问时也别有用心地说什么“老挝东南部一直被用来作为运输人员、武器、弹药和供应品的一个重要交通线”。
    共和党参议员哈特菲尔德二十八日在参议院说，种种迹象表明，约翰逊政府正在认真考虑把地面战争扩大到南越境外。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”被越南军民打得走投无路的美帝国主义的任何垂死挣扎，只能使它加速走向彻底的失败。
    面临美帝的空前困境，连美国资产阶级报刊也不能不为美帝扩大侵越战争的前景担忧。美国垄断集团喉舌之一《华尔街日报》二十四日在一篇文章中发出哀鸣：“整个（侵略）越南的努力可能是注定了要失败的”。美国侵略者在越南的败局已定。坚持持久战斗的英雄越南人民必定赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
