My husband is named Li Erbao, and he is the leader of the fourth production brigade in Nangundonggou. For thirteen years, he has been diligently serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. The community calls him the "Iron Man" and a model leader.

In the past, I thought this was just a joke. I believed that being a village official was like being a stepmother—hard work with no rewards. I didn't want him to be an official at all. The reason was that I was only thinking within the small circle of "self," and I didn't understand that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power.

I have three children, with the oldest not yet ten years old. Every day, besides working in the fields, I have to cook, operate the mill, feed the pigs, and take care of the children. I am so busy that I can't catch my breath. Other men in the village help with household chores and take care of the children when they return from the fields. But Erbao is always out early and back late, and often has meetings at night. He doesn't help with the household chores, but he doesn't earn more work points than others. He has been injured three times for the collective. Once, while lifting stones to build a bridge, he fell from a height of over forty feet, blinded one eye, and lay in bed for several months. He works so hard for the collective, but some people still curse him: "Serves you right." I heard these curses, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt that being an official had no good outcome. It's better to be a community member, doing whatever is asked and taking care of the family. I insisted that he should not be an official.

However, Erbao seemed to be bewitched by the idea of being an official. No matter how much I persuaded him, he wouldn't listen. Not only that, but since 1964, every time there was an election, he voted for himself, as if he was deliberately provoking me. Once, I saw him vote for himself and angrily said, "Only you can be the leader!" He smiled and said, "If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't be officials, who will?" He often talked to me about this, but at that time, I was blinded by "self" and couldn't understand. Sometimes, I even deliberately provoked him, not cooking for him, and holding him back.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, my consciousness was raised. Especially through the study classes on Mao Zedong Thought and some thematic criticism sessions held by the brigade party branch, I understood the importance of seizing power. Chairman Mao taught us:

"All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces precisely because they want to maintain their power." Chairman Mao's words resonated deeply with us poor and lower-middle peasants. In the dark old society, because the power was not in the hands of the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, we suffered greatly. Our family rented land from a rich peasant, and the grain we harvested was not enough to pay the rent. Erbao had to take his younger brother to beg for food. When I was seven years old, our family couldn't pay the rent to the landlord, and life was difficult. My parents, with tears in their eyes, gave me away as a child bride. Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country to make a revolution. After countless martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, we established the people's power and finally lived a good life. The Chinese Khrushchev, this big bad guy, wants to restore capitalism, let the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists ride on our heads again, and let the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice and endure twice the hardship. We will never agree to this. I also remembered that after Erbao was injured, those who cursed him were all rich peasants. I understood even more that the proletarian power must not be lost, and we poor and lower-middle peasants must definitely hold the power of socialism well. My thoughts changed, and I also agreed to let Erbao be the leader.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles," my consciousness was further raised. I realized that whether or not to support my husband in being an official was not a matter of gain or loss, but a matter of "public" versus "private," a matter of revolution versus personal interests. I do a good job at home, so Erbao can concentrate on his work in the brigade, and I also contribute to the revolution. My thoughts changed, and the same household chores, which I used to do only for personal gain and felt wronged, now I do them happily for the revolution.

Not only do I actively support him in being the leader, but I also help him study and apply Chairman Mao's works to do a good job in the brigade. Not only that, but I also started to do the work of the brigade. Last summer, the women's team leader of the production brigade fell ill, and the women said, "Rongni, you do it!" I said, "Alright! Serve the people." I did it for eight months. During this period, I worked with the women until the last day of the lunar year. On the second day of the New Year, I led the women back to the fields to work, plow the land, weed the wheat, and changed the old custom of not working until the fifteenth day of the New Year. Last winter and this spring, the agricultural infrastructure construction and preparation work in our brigade were all done very well. Although I was busy inside and outside, I felt very happy doing it. My husband and I are determined to hold the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, use the power well, and be the people's servants for life.

### 丢掉私心，支持丈夫干革命

　　丢掉私心，支持丈夫干革命
　　河北省平山县南滚龙沟大队第四生产队社员　刘荣妮
    我丈夫叫李二保，是南滚龙沟第四生产队队长。他当队长十三年来，一直忠心耿耿、勤勤恳恳地为贫下中农服务。社员们称他是
  “铁汉子”，模范队长。
    群众这样称呼他，我过去总觉得这是逗“傻子”。我认为，在村里当干部是“后娘奶孩子”——费力不讨好。说什么也不愿意让他当干部。原因是，只在“私”字这个小圈圈里打算盘，不懂得革命的根本问题是政权问题。
    我有三个孩子，最大的不到十岁。我每天除了下地劳动，还得做饭，推碾，喂猪，看孩子，忙得喘不过气来。别人家的男人下地回来帮家里做活，领领孩子。可是二保每天都是早出晚归，夜里还经常开会，一年四季吃不上几次热饭。家里的事他没有管，可工分也不比人家挣得多。他为公先后负过三次重伤。有一次抬石头修桥，从四丈多高摔下来，摔瞎了一只眼，一直躺了几个月。他这样一心一意为集体，却还有人骂他：“活该”。我听了这些骂声，越想越觉得当干部没有“好下场”，不如当个社员，叫干啥就干啥，又能照顾家里。说什么也不能让他当干部了。
    可是，二保好象中了“干部迷”，我左说右劝，他就是不听。不但不听，从一九六四年以后，每次选举，他都选了自己，象专门和我呕气一样。有一次，我见他选了自己，生气地说：“队长就你能当！”他笑着说：“干部，咱们贫下中农不当，谁当？”他经常同我讲这个道理，那时，我被“私”字迷了心窍，就是听不进去。有时，还故意气他，不给他做饭吃，拉他的后腿。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我提高了觉悟。特别是大队党支部举办的毛泽东思想学习班和一些专题批判会，使我懂得了掌握政权的重要。毛主席他老人家教导我们说：
  “世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”毛主席的话，说在俺们贫下中农的心坎上。在那黑暗的旧社会，由于政权不在工人和贫下中农手里，俺们吃够了苦头。我们家租种富农的地，打的粮食还不够交租，二保只好领着弟弟去讨饭。我七岁那年，家里交不上地主的地租，生活困难，爹娘含着眼泪把我给了人家当童养媳。毛主席领导全国人民闹革命，经过无数先烈流血牺牲，才建立了人民的政权，我们才过上了好日子。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋，妄想复辟资本主义，让地主、富农、资本家重新骑在俺们头上，让贫下中农受二茬罪吃二遍苦，我们说什么也不答应。我又想起二保受伤后，骂他的都是些富农分子，我更懂得了无产阶级的印把子不能丢，我们贫下中农一定要为社会主义掌好权。我的思想一通，也愿意二保当队长了。
    在学习毛主席著作，特别是“老三篇”以后，我的思想更提高啦。我认识到，支持不支持自己的丈夫当干部，根本不是什么吃亏不吃亏的问题，而是为“公”还是为“私”的问题，是为革命还是为个人的问题。我干好家里的活，让二保集中精力搞好队里工作，我也就为革命出了力。思想一变，同样的家务活，过去只想到私利，干起来觉得很委屈；现在一想到革命，干起来就感到很痛快了。
    我不但积极支持他当队长，还注意帮助他活学活用毛主席著作，搞好队里的工作。不但这样，我自己也干起队里的工作来了。去年夏天，生产队妇女队长生了病，妇女们说：“荣妮，你就干起来吧！”我说：“行！为人民服务呗。”我一直干了八个来月。这期间，我同妇女们一起干活一直干到腊月三十。正月初二，我又带动妇女下地干活，整地，锄麦子，改变了过去要过正月十五才下地的旧习惯。去冬今春，我们队的农田基本建设和备耕工作，都搞得很好。尽管里里外外很忙，我干起来却很愉快。我们夫妻二人，决心为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，甘当一辈子人民的勤务员。
