The People's Liberation Army's three services' cadres and soldiers are determined, together with revolutionary teachers and students, to launch a campaign of extensive study, extensive propaganda, extensive summary, and extensive implementation of the momentum of Chairman Mao's "March 7" instructions, to achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated March 8, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and profound proletarian feelings, enthusiastically hailed the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" instructions and the reissuance of this brilliant instruction. The cadres and soldiers unanimously agreed that the brilliant "March 7" instruction is our great teacher Mao's great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the compass guiding the army in doing the "three supports, two military" work, and the beacon lighting the way to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

One year ago, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the famous "March 7" instruction, teaching us: "The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself, and during military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these, as long as they are seriously implemented, the problems are not difficult to solve." The broad cadres and soldiers of the land, sea, and air forces, with the greatest enthusiasm, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, swiftly formed many military-political training teams, battalions, and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, rushed to various universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and actively helped revolutionary teachers and students carry out military-political training, achieving one victory after another. Today, the broad cadres and soldiers, upon reviewing the brilliant "March 7" instruction, feel particularly close to it.

In the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, at the air force base, along the vast seas, and on the front lines of the "three supports, two military," the cadres and soldiers held celebration meetings, symposiums, and oath-taking meetings. Some units also paraded with revolutionary teachers and students, launching a campaign of extensive study, extensive propaganda, extensive summary, and extensive implementation of the "March 7" instruction, creating a scene of joy everywhere. The cadres and soldiers waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," held up placards with Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" a thousand times and ten thousand times.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the various military branches and arms, and the troops stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, and other places, enthusiastically discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction. At the General Staff Department and the leadership organs of the Navy and Air Force, many units' cadres and soldiers studied Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction word by word. They said that one year's practice has proven that the brilliant thoughts of the "March 7" instruction have great guiding significance for all sectors of the country. It is the lighthouse guiding the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country to achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the People's Liberation Army's artillery, armored, engineering, railway, communications, and chemical defense forces, as well as the Higher Military Academy and Political Academy, said that Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest trust, and greatest whip for our army. This instruction, which concentrates the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, is a powerful ideological weapon for achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cadres and soldiers of the 8341st Unit stationed in Beijing's Textile Factory and the students of the Mao Zedong Thought study class in the factory said in a symposium that Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction is the soul of military training, the weapon of struggle, the lighthouse of progress, and the guarantee for achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The military-political training personnel stationed in Shanghai, upon reviewing Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction, said that this great instruction most concisely, thoroughly, comprehensively, and highly summarizes the fundamental purpose, tasks, and methods of military-political training. Fully implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction, we will be invincible.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army carrying out military-political training tasks in various schools across the country reviewed the brilliant achievements made in the past year under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction and a series of latest instructions, exchanged experiences and insights on studying and implementing the "March 7" instruction, and deeply felt that only by being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, deeply understanding, studying, and applying Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction and a series of latest instructions, and fully implementing them, can we complete the glorious tasks assigned by Chairman Mao and achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The military training personnel who have made outstanding achievements in military training in Beijing's Shijingshan Middle School and Caochangdi Middle School said that the revolutionary struggle practice of the past year has made us realize that Chairman Mao's famous "March 7" instruction on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the fundamental guiding principle for our military training work and the source of victory for the leftist work. The most fundamental reason why we can quickly help revolutionary teachers and students achieve revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and resume classes for revolution in a short time is that we have unified the thoughts of revolutionary teachers and students with the great Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the military training team of the Experimental School attached to the South China Normal University recalled their journey and said excitedly that in military training, as long as we act decisively according to the brilliant "March 7" instruction, we will win and advance. Without it, we will take detours and fail.

The broad cadres and soldiers, upon reviewing Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction, unanimously expressed that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize loyalty, grasp the application, and more diligently study, enthusiastically propagate, resolutely implement, and fully implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction and a series of latest instructions. They would increase their proletarian revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, prevent the sabotage and destruction by domestic and foreign class enemies, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives attending the experience exchange meeting of the Nanjing Army's large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the military training personnel of Tianjin's Yan'an Middle School, Beijing's Shijingshan Middle School, Beijing's Caochangdi Middle School, and Tianjin's 105th Middle School attending the Beijing Army's meeting to implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction, as well as the cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Taiyuan, Hefei, Changchun, and other places, all emphasized that the attitude towards the "March 7" instruction and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is the touchstone for examining whether a revolutionary soldier is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, immediately launch a mass movement of extensive study, extensive inspection, extensive summary, and extensive implementation of Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction, summarize experiences, carry forward achievements, find gaps, guard against arrogance and impatience, and strive for new victories, so that Chairman Mao's "March 7" instruction and a series of latest instructions can be fully implemented, and contribute their greatest efforts to achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    据新华社八日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，最热烈地欢呼毛主席“三·七”指示发出一周年和这一光辉指示的重新发表。指战员们一致认为，光辉的“三·七”指示，是我们伟大导师毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署，是指引解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作的方向盘，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。
    一年前，伟大领袖毛主席发出著名的“三·七”指示，教导我们：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。所有这些，只要认真去做，问题并不难解决。”陆海空三军广大指战员以最大的热忱，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，雷厉风行地组成许多军政训练团、营和毛泽东思想宣传队，奔赴各大、中、小学校，积极帮助革命师生实行军政训练，取得了一个又一个的胜利。今天，广大指战员重温光辉的“三·七”指示，感到分外亲切。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，在空军机场，在万里海疆，在“三支”“两军”第一线上，指战员们纷纷举行庆祝会、座谈会、誓师会，有的部队还同革命师生一道游行，掀起了大学习、大宣传、大总结、大落实“三·七”指示的热潮，到处是一片欢腾景象。指战员们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛主席“三·七”指示的语录牌，千遍万遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”
    人民解放军各总部、国防科委、各军种、兵种以及北京、上海、天津、广州、沈阳、南京、济南、武汉等地驻军广大指战员，纷纷畅谈了毛主席“三·七”指示的伟大意义。在总参谋部和海军、空军领导机关，许多单位的指战员逐字逐句地学习了伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示。他们说，一年来的实践证明，“三·七”指示的光辉思想，对全国各行各业都具有伟大的指导意义。它是指引全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的灯塔。出席人民解放军炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵、铁道兵、通信兵、防化学兵等六兵种和高等军事学院、政治学院学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们说，毛主席的“三·七”指示是对我军的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大信任、最大鞭策。这一指示，集中体现了毛主席的伟大战略部署，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的强大的思想武器。八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员和工厂毛泽东思想学习班的学员们在一起座谈时说，毛主席“三·七”指示是军训的灵魂，斗争的武器，前进的灯塔，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的保证。驻沪三军军训人员重温毛主席“三·七”指示说，这一伟大指示，最精辟、最透彻、最全面、最高度地概括了军政训练的根本目的、任务和方法。全面落实毛主席的伟大指示，我们就会无往而不胜。
    在各地大、中、小学校执行军政训练任务的人民解放军广大指战员，回顾了一年来在毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下所取得的辉煌成就，交流了学习和执行“三·七”指示的经验和体会，深深感到，只有无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，深刻领会，学用一致，条条落实，全面落实，才能胜利完成毛主席交给的光荣任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。在军政训练中做出显著成绩的驻北京市石景山中学、草场地中学的军训人员说，一年来的革命斗争实践使我们体会到，毛主席的有关无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示，是我们军训工作的根本指导方针，是支左工作取得胜利的源泉。我们能在很短的时间里迅速帮助革命师生实现革命大联合、革命三结合和复课闹革命，最根本的原因就是用伟大的毛泽东思想统一了革命师生的思想。华南师院附属实验学校的军训团同志回忆自己走过的历程，激动地说，在军训中，只要坚决按照光辉的“三·七”指示办事，就胜利，就前进，离开了它，就走弯路，就失败。
    广大指战员在重温毛主席“三·七”指示时，一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，更加努力学习、热情宣传、坚决执行、全面落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，百倍地提高无产阶级革命警惕，严防国内外阶级敌人的捣乱和破坏，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中为人民立新功。正在参加南京部队大办毛泽东思想学习班经验交流会的全体代表，出席北京部队贯彻落实毛主席“三·七”指示会议的驻天津延安中学、北京石景山中学、北京草场地中学、天津一○五中学的军训人员，以及黑龙江、青海、太原、合肥、长春等地驻军指战员，在学习“三·七”指示时都强调指出，对待“三·七”指示和毛主席的一系列最新指示的态度，是检验一个革命战士是不是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的试金石。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，立即开展一个大学习、大检查、大总结、大落实毛主席“三·七”指示的群众运动，总结经验，发扬成绩，找出差距，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，使毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示全面落实，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而贡献自己的最大力量。
