Additionally, they shot down four helicopters, damaged four military vehicles, and sank or damaged four warships.

The people and soldiers of the ancient town of Go Cong in Gia Dinh Province, located northwest of Saigon and known as the "iron wall" by the people of South Vietnam, launched fierce attacks on the enemy from January 31 to February 20. They attacked and controlled the town of Go Cong, the military support base of the puppet army in Phu Hoi, and the military training school in Trung Hoa.
