Liu Cai, a representative attending the Third Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the Shenyang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, is a revolutionary vanguard fostered by the great Mao Zedong Thought. He is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has performed new meritorious deeds for the people. People enthusiastically praise him as an outstanding representative of a new generation who regards Mao Zedong Thought as their first and foremost life principle.

“As long as my heart is beating, I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao”

Liu Cai is a soldier in the reconnaissance platoon of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Communist Party. In November 1966, while performing a construction task, he sustained severe injuries. His right forearm muscles, blood vessels, and bones were shattered, his jawbone was blown into three pieces, his brain suffered severe concussion, and he lost one-third of his blood, putting his life in grave danger.

The commanding officers of the unit rushed to the emergency room, and the hospital dispatched doctors. All medical staff immediately began emergency rescue efforts, and teams of comrades rushed to the emergency room to donate blood and skin. Everyone was worried about Liu Cai's life.

Due to the severity of his injuries, local anesthesia could not find a place to administer the medication, and general anesthesia risked endangering Liu Cai's life. The emergency rescue had to be carried out without anesthesia. Liu Cai lay quietly, his lips moving slightly. The doctor leaned close to his mouth and heard a faint but powerful voice: “Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice….”

After the medical staff's emergency rescue, Liu Cai regained consciousness. As soon as he opened his eyes, he strained to look at the wall, as if searching for something. The doctor asked with concern, “Comrade Liu Cai, do you need anything?” He opened his eyes wide and struggled to say, “I want— to see—Chairman Mao!” The doctor immediately pointed to the colorful portrait of Chairman Mao for him to see. He gazed at it for a long time, his eyes welling up with tears of happiness.

“As long as my heart is beating, I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao” was the first sentence Liu Cai uttered after regaining consciousness from eight hours of unconsciousness. This sentence fully expressed Liu Cai's infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, revealing his lofty spiritual realm of having only Chairman Mao in his heart. The medical staff were moved and said, “Comrade Liu Cai is truly loyal to Chairman Mao every second!”

On the third day after his injury, Liu Cai was transferred to another hospital. Before leaving, the doctor asked him, “Comrade Liu Cai, do you have any requests?” Liu Cai's jawbone, shattered into three pieces, was tightly wrapped with wire, making it difficult for him to speak. He forced out from his throat, “Bring me—Chairman Mao's books.” When the doctor placed Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics by his pillow and pinned a shining Mao badge on his quilt, he looked at the Mao badge and smiled.

Liu Cai arrived at the new hospital. The doctor thought he needed an immediate blood transfusion and intravenous drip, but what Liu Cai needed most was Mao Zedong Thought. He told the doctor, “Give me the four volumes of Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics!”

Under the careful treatment of the medical staff, Liu Cai's condition gradually improved. However, his right forearm was still in a cast and sling, making it immobile. One evening, the hospital screened the film “The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought.” Liu Cai heard that he could see our great teacher Mao Zedong on the screen, so he disregarded his injuries and, with the help of others, went to the club to watch. When our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, appeared on the screen, the entire audience immediately erupted in applause. Liu Cai completely forgot about his right forearm in a cast and wanted to use all his strength to applaud for Chairman Mao. But as soon as he raised his hand, the pain was excruciating. He was heartbroken and cried, thinking, “Can it be that as a son of a poor peasant, I can no longer applaud for the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, our great savior Chairman Mao? No! A thousand times no, a million times no! Even with one hand, I will applaud for Chairman Mao, and even without hands, I will praise Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart!” Liu Cai went without eating or sleeping well for several days, racking his brain, and finally came up with a solution: the next time he watched the movie, he would arrange with a nearby comrade to applaud for Chairman Mao together, one hand each.

Liu Cai was like this, always keeping the red sun in his heart and having only Chairman Mao in his mind. He said, “As long as my heart is beating, I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!”

“Even if my life lasts only one second, it must not deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought”

Liu Cai was born into a poor peasant family. He loves Chairman Mao deeply in his soul and is loyal to Chairman Mao in his actions. From the day he entered the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army, he enthusiastically responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to “study Chairman Mao's works, learn with questions, apply actively, learn and use together, learn urgently when needed, see immediate results, and work hard on the ‘use’ aspect.” He regarded studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as his first need in life, learning and applying immediately, seeing immediate results, and resolving to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. He often said, “Chairman Mao's instructions must be followed. Even if my life lasts only one second, it must not deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought.”

Liu Cai's most distinctive feature in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is his emphasis on the “use” aspect. He fully implemented his loyalty to Chairman Mao in the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. He wrote in his diary:

“Chairman Mao's words must be learned, listened to, and applied. The more they are applied, the closer one feels to Chairman Mao, and the tighter one follows Chairman Mao. ‘Use’ is indispensable for truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Only by learning and applying, and applying while learning, can one deepen one's feelings for Chairman Mao and understand Chairman Mao's instructions more thoroughly.”

Liu Cai first applied Mao Zedong Thought to transform his own thoughts. He was ruthless towards the bourgeois “self” and had no regrets for the individualistic “I,” completely and thoroughly revolutionizing his mind to seize the power of the “self” within. Once, Liu Cai wrote a letter to a comrade, but as soon as he picked up his pen, he thought the comrade was a leader of a revolutionary mass organization and feared saying the wrong thing, revealing his low level. He put down his pen. As soon as the “self” appeared, Liu Cai seized it. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, deeply excavating the roots of his selfishness, and immediately exposed his selfish thoughts to his comrades, letting them help him analyze and criticize. Through exposing and criticizing his selfishness, he realized that having the “self” meant not being able to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively supporting the revolutionary left with Mao Zedong Thought. He was filled with revolutionary passion, using his left hand to write more than a dozen letters to that comrade, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Liu Cai was like this, with a spirit of “seizing the day,” continuously revolutionizing his soul, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to transform himself, and his revolutionary spiritual level becoming higher and higher. He acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, doing bit by bit what was beneficial to the people and the revolution, linking everything he did with his loyalty to Chairman Mao.

In March 1966, construction began, and a kiln had to be repaired urgently. To start work on time, it had to be completed within half a day. However, the bricks were on the other side of a pond, with mountains on both sides. Liu Cai looked at the terrain, thought about the urgent task, rolled up his trousers, and jumped into the water, shouting, “Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory,” as he waded through the water to carry the bricks. In March in the north, thin ice still floated on the water surface, and the pond bottom was full of broken stones and reed roots. Liu Cai carried the bricks five times, his legs turned purple, and his feet were cut, but his comrades pulled him, and he would not come ashore. When others went into the water, he pushed them up, saying, “I am already in the water, let me do it alone!”

On one day in August, construction was in full swing. As soon as they arrived at the site, it started to rain. The working surface was piled with many stones that had fallen after blasting, affecting the normal progress of the project. Liu Cai took off his outer clothes, wearing only shorts and a singlet, braved the heavy rain, and pushed the small car loaded with stones without touching the ground, running as fast as he could. He accidentally tripped over a stone. The platoon leader noticed that there was blood where Liu Cai had fallen and quickly called him to the medic for bandaging. Liu Cai ran while answering, “It's nothing!” Other comrades wanted to replace him, but he refused to let them. He said, “Sweating for the ‘public’ is right, bleeding for the ‘public’ is glorious. The road is very slippery now, let me do it alone!”

Comrade Liu Cai's spirit of daring to take on heavy responsibilities and striving to be the first is a vivid manifestation of his infinite love for Chairman Mao, his active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, his transformation of his worldview, and his hard work on the “use” aspect. His actions shone with the great communist spirit of selflessly serving the people and putting others before oneself.

Every new instruction from Chairman Mao, Liu Cai regarded as a battle task to be executed without any discount. When Chairman Mao called for a revolutionary great criticism, Liu Cai, with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, eagerly joined in criticizing revisionism. Once, the hospital held a criticism meeting. Liu Cai prepared all day, wanting to speak at the meeting. The medical staff saw that his jawbone was still wired, making it difficult for him to eat and drink, and advised him to criticize next time. Liu Cai said, “Carrying out the revolutionary great criticism is Chairman Mao's instruction. Chairman Mao has given the order, and I will charge into battle.” He insisted on criticizing the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionism at the meeting. His right hand had lost its function, so he wrote criticism articles with his left hand. Comrades saw him sweating profusely and said with concern, “Comrade Liu Cai, let us write for you!” He said, “Mao Xian was injured in the head but insisted on fighting the Kuomintang bandits. I have a mouth to criticize revisionism and a hand to throw knives and guns at the enemy.” He wrote more than twenty thousand words of criticism articles with his left hand, using vivid facts and profound analysis to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's “class struggle extinction” theory, “public-private fusion” theory, and “exploitation is meritorious” and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. Everyone who had contact with Liu Cai praised, “Comrade Liu Cai's every word and deed is permeated with the red line of Mao Zedong Thought. He is a great loyalist who expresses his loyalty to Chairman Mao through studying and applying Chairman Mao's instructions.”

“The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to a new stage. Liu Cai was extremely joyful and determined to be a self-aware propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, “A revolutionary soldier is not enough to be loyal to Chairman Mao himself. Every revolutionary must be loyal to Chairman Mao. I will invest all my energy into propagating Chairman Mao's instructions, spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the five lakes and four seas, and making the class brothers in the five lakes and four seas all turn to Chairman Mao.”

In the army, Liu Cai, with a fiery class sentiment, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to his comrades. He believed that transmitting Chairman Mao's voice to his comrades' hearts, making every comrade advance on the revolutionary course guided by the great teacher Mao Zedong, was the greatest concern, the greatest care, and the greatest help for his comrades. All the officers and soldiers in the platoon, if anyone's mood changed or thoughts fluctuated, he would notice it in his heart and would not rest until he thoroughly talked it out. New soldier Chen Qinglong, as soon as he arrived at the platoon, Liu Cai formed a “red pair” with him, determined to guide the new comrade onto the path of studying Mao Zedong Thought from the beginning. He studied Mao Zedong Thought with Chen Qinglong, helping him work hard on the “use” aspect, making Chen Qinglong's roots of serving the people deeper and deeper, and his revolutionary enthusiasm stronger and stronger. At the year-end evaluation, they were commended as the “red pair” model of the platoon.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Cai was more self-aware in enthusiastically propagating and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. He regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the people as the greatest love for the people, the greatest service to the people, and the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. As soon as the Red Guard movement arose, he actively supported their revolutionary actions and wrote programs to praise the Red Guards' merits. Everywhere he went, he also studied the “Three Constantly Read Articles” with the Red Guard youths, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding them to grow healthily. When he learned that revolutionary youth An Ligang did not have the “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” he ran to several bookstores to buy it, but could not find it, so he decided to copy a “Quotations from Chairman Mao” for An Ligang. He bought a red plastic-covered notebook and started copying word by word, sometimes copying under an oil lamp until dawn. He spent twenty-eight days of his spare time and finally copied a shining “Quotations from Chairman Mao” with more than eighty-eight thousand words. He neatly pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover, checked it from beginning to end, and then happily gave it to An Ligang. An Ligang received the hand-copied “Quotations from Chairman Mao” from Liu Cai, was extremely happy, and excitedly told Liu Cai that he would definitely study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

After Liu Cai was seriously injured and hospitalized, he was still full of enthusiasm for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as he regained consciousness from severe unconsciousness, he lay in bed organizing his fellow patients to study Chairman Mao's works. As soon as his body could move, he got out of bed to have heart-to-heart talks with comrades in various wards. His shattered jawbone was just wired up, and his mouth could only open as wide as a finger, but he wrote the program “Long Live the ‘Three Constantly Read Articles’” and rehearsed and performed with comrades. Throughout the performance of a few minutes, Liu Cai's every action and every song deeply moved everyone. Comrades said: Liu Cai propagated the “Three Constantly Read Articles,” but he himself was a living example of actively studying and applying the “Three Constantly Read Articles”!

    伟大毛泽东思想造就出来的革命的先锋战士
    ——记沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子刘才
    出席人民解放军沈阳部队第三次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的代表刘才，是一位用伟大毛泽东思想造就出来的革命的先锋战士。他无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为人民立了新功。人们热烈赞扬他是把毛泽东思想化为第一生命的一代新人的突出代表。
  “只要心脏还在跳动，就永远忠于毛主席”
    刘才是人民解放军沈阳部队某部侦察连战士，共产党员。一九六六年十一月，他在执行施工任务时负了重伤，右前臂肌肉、血管、骨头被崩碎，下巴骨炸成了三截，大脑严重震荡，全身血液失去三分之一，生命处于垂危状态。
    部队首长亲临急救室，医院派来了医生，全体医护人员立即投入了紧急抢救，一队队战友涌向急救室献血献皮，大家都在为刘才的生命担心。
    由于伤情过重，局部麻醉找不到下药针的地方，全身麻醉又怕危及刘才的生命，急救只好在不麻醉的情况下进行。刘才静静地躺着，嘴唇微微在动。医生贴近他的嘴边，顿时听到一种细小有力的声音：“下定决心，不怕牺牲……。”
    经过医护人员的紧急抢救，刘才从昏迷中醒来了。他一睁开眼就吃力地盯着墙壁，象是在寻找什么。医生关切地问：“刘才同志，你需要什么吗？”他睁大了眼睛，艰难地一字一字地说：“我要——看看——毛主席！”医生立即把毛主席的彩色画像指给他看，他久久地凝望着，眼里闪动着幸福的泪花。
    “我要看看毛主席”，这是刘才经过八个多小时的昏迷后，在刚一醒来时说出的第一句话。这句话，集中地表达了刘才对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的一颗红心，揭示了刘才心中只有伟大领袖毛主席的崇高精神境界。医护人员感动地说：“刘才同志真是每分每秒无限忠于毛主席啊！”
    伤后第三天，刘才转院了。临走前，医生问他：“刘才同志，你有什么要求没有？”刘才被炸断三截的下巴骨用钢丝缠得紧紧的，说话很困难，他就从喉咙里迸发出：“给我——带上——毛主席的书。”当医生把毛主席的革命宝书放在他枕边，又把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章别在他被子上的时候，他看着毛主席像章，露出了笑容。
    刘才来到了新的医院。医生认为需要立即为他补血和输液，刘才心里最需要的却是毛泽东思想。他对医生说：“把毛主席的四卷革命宝书给我！”
      在医护人员的精心治疗下，刘才的伤势逐渐有所好转。但是右前臂还打着石膏，挂着三角巾，不能动弹。一天晚上，医院放映影片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》。刘才听说在银幕上能看到我们的伟大导师毛主席，便不顾身残伤痛，由人扶着到俱乐部去看。当我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席，神采奕奕地出现在银幕上的时候，全场立即响起热烈的掌声。刘才完全忘记了右前臂打着石膏，恨不得把全身的劲都用来向毛主席鼓掌。可是，刚一抬手，就疼得钻心。他为自己不能向毛主席鼓掌，难过地哭了。他想：“难道我这个贫农的儿子，今后就真的再也不能为世界人民心中的红太阳、我们的大救星毛主席鼓掌了吗？不行！一千个不行，一万个不行！一只手我也要为毛主席鼓掌，就是没有手我也要从心底把毛主席颂扬！”刘才一连几天饭不想吃，觉睡不好，苦思苦想，终于想出了一个办法：再看电影时，他事先和邻座的战友约好，毛主席在银幕上一出现，两人就一人一只手，合起来为毛主席鼓掌。
    刘才就是这样胸中常怀红太阳，心里只有毛主席。他说：“只要心脏还在跳动，就永远忠于毛主席！”
      “生命属于我那怕只有一秒钟，也
  不能让它脱离毛泽东思想的轨道”
    刘才出身在一个贫农家庭里。他热爱毛主席，爱在灵魂深处；忠于毛主席，忠在实际行动上。他从走进人民解放军这座毛泽东思想大学校的那天开始，就热烈响应林彪副主席“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作当成生活的第一需要，学了就用，立竿见影，立志做毛主席的好战士。他常说：“对毛主席的指示，就是要照办。生命属于我那怕只有一秒钟，也不能让它脱离毛泽东思想的轨道。”
    刘才活学活用毛泽东思想，最明显的特点，就是突出一个“用”字。他把对毛主席的忠诚，完全落实
  在对毛泽东思想的活学活用上。他在日记上写道：
  “毛主席的话，必须去学、去听、去用，用得越狠，
  对毛主席越亲，跟毛主席越紧。”“要把毛泽东思想真
  正学到手，万万离不开一个‘用’字。只有学了就用，
  用中再学，对毛主席的感情才能越深，对毛主席的指
  示才能理解得越透。”
      刘才活学活用毛泽东思想，首先用在改造自己的
  思想上。他对资产阶级的“私”字毫不客气，对个人
  主义的“我”字毫不留恋，以完全彻底的革命精神去
  夺头脑中“私”字的权。一次，刘才给一个同志写信，
  刚提笔，想起他是一个革命群众组织的头头，怕说错
  了话显得自己水平低，笔又放下了。“私”字一露头，刘才就抓住不放。他反复学习毛主席著作，狠挖私根，发现灵魂深处还隐藏着名利思想，就马上把私心彻底亮给战友，让同志们帮助他分析、批判。经过亮私、斗私，他认识到，有了“私”字，就不能坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，用毛泽东思想积极支持革命左派。他满怀革命激情，用左手先后给那个同志写了十几封信，宣传毛主席的最新指示。
      刘才就是这样以“只争朝夕”的精神，在灵魂深处爆发革命，不断用毛泽东思想改造自己，思想革命化境界越来越高。他处处遵照毛主席的教导办事，一点一滴地做有益于人民、有益于革命的工作，把自己所做的一切都和忠于毛主席紧紧地联系起来。
    一九六六年三月，施工开始，要赶修一个烘炉。为了按时开工，必须在半天内修成。可是砖放在一个水塘的对岸，水塘左右两侧都是山。刘才看了看地势，想到任务紧急，把棉裤一挽就跳进了水里，嘴里高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，涉水背起砖来。北方的三月，水面上还漂浮着薄薄的冰碴，水塘底下尽是碎石和芦苇根子。刘才一连背了五趟，腿冻紫了，脚也扎破了，同志们拉他，他也不上岸，别人下水他就把别人往上推，嘴里不断地说：“我已经在水里了，就让我一个人来吧！”
    八月的一天，施工正在紧张进行。他们刚到工地就下起了雨。作业面上堆积了许多放炮后崩下的石碴没有运走，影响工程的正常进行。刘才把外衣一脱，穿着裤衩背心，冒着大雨，脚不沾地地推着满载石碴的小车飞跑，不小心被一块石头绊倒。指导员发现刘才摔倒的地方有血，急忙叫他到卫生员那里包扎。刘才边跑边回答：“没事！”别的同志要去换他，他说啥也不肯。他说：“把汗淌在‘公’字上应该，把血流在‘公’字上光荣，现在路滑得很，就让我一个人来吧！”
    刘才同志这种在重担子面前奋勇争先的精神，是他无限热爱毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，在“用”字上狠下功夫的生动体现。他的行动，闪耀着完全彻底为人民服务和毫不利己专门利人的伟大共产主义的思想光辉。
    毛主席发出的每一条最新指示，刘才都当成战斗任务去执行，从来不打折扣。毛主席号召开展革命的大批判，刘才就怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，踊跃地起来批判修正主义。一次，医院召开批判大会，刘才起早贪黑，足足准备了一天，要到大会上发言。医护人员看他下巴骨还用钢丝锁着，吃饭、喝水都困难，劝他下次再批判。刘才说：“开展革命大批判是毛主席的指示。毛主席有了命令，我就要冲锋陷阵。”他坚持在大会上愤怒地批判了反革命修正主义的滔天罪行。他右手失去了机能，就用左手写批判文章。同志们见他累得满头大汗，关心地说：“刘才同志，我们替你写吧！”他说：“麦贤得脑子负伤还坚持打蒋匪帮，我有嘴就要批修，有手就要向敌人投掷刀枪。”他用左手先后写了两万多字的批判文章，以活生生的事实和深刻的
  分析，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、
  “公私溶化”论和“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义
  谬论。凡是和刘才接触过的人，都称赞说：“刘才同志
  的一言一行贯穿着毛泽东思想的红线，他是通过狠学
  狠用毛主席的指示，来表现对毛主席的大忠的。”
      “把毛泽东思想传播到五湖四海，让
  五湖四海的阶级兄弟心心向着毛主席”
    世界已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把中国革命和世界革命推进到了一个崭新的阶段。刘才无比欢欣鼓舞，决心做一个自觉传播毛泽东思想的宣传员。他说：“一个革命战士光自己忠于毛主席，是不够的，必须让每一个革命者都忠于毛主席。我要把生命的全部能量投入到宣传毛主席的指示上，把毛泽东思想传播到五湖四海，让五湖四海的阶级兄弟心心向着毛主席。”
    在部队里，刘才以火一样的阶级感情，热情地向战友宣传毛泽东思想。他认为，把毛主席的声音传送到战友的心坎里，让每个战友都在伟大导师毛主席指引的革命航道上前进，是对战友的最大关心，最大爱护，最大帮助。全连的干部战士，那个情绪有变化，思想有波动，他都看在眼里，想在心上，不彻底谈通，饭吃不好，觉也睡不着。新战士陈青龙，一到连队，刘才就和他结成“一对红”，决心一开始就把新战友引上学习毛泽东思想的轨道。他和陈青龙一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他在“用”字上狠下功夫，使陈青龙为人民服务的思想根子越扎越深，革命干劲越来越足。年终总评，他们被树为连队“一对红”标兵。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，刘才热情宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想更加自觉。他把向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，看作是最大的爱民，最大的为人民服务，是对毛主席的最大忠诚。红卫兵运动刚一兴起，他积极支持他们的革命行动，编写节目颂扬红卫兵的功绩。每到一地，他还和红卫兵小将一起学习
  “老三篇”，用毛泽东思想武装红卫兵的头脑，引导他们健康成长。当他得知革命小将安利金没有《毛主席语录》时，跑了好几个书店去买，没有买着，就决心抄一本《毛主席语录》送给安利金。他买来一本红塑料面的日记本，一字一句抄起来，有时在油灯下一直抄到天亮。他用了二十八天的业余时间，一本金光闪闪的八万八千多字的《毛主席语录》，终于抄写出来了。他在扉页上端端正正贴上了毛主席像，又从头至尾校对了两遍，才高高兴兴地送给安利金。安利金接过刘才送给的手抄《毛主席语录》，高兴得不得了，激动地向刘才表示：一定要努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    刘才身负重伤住院以后，也满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想。他从严重的昏迷中刚刚清醒过来不久，就躺在床上组织病友学习毛主席著作，身体刚刚能够活动，就下床到各病室和同志们谈心。他炸断的下巴骨才用钢丝锁起来不久，嘴只能张开一个手指头那么大，就编写了《万岁“老三篇”》的节目，和同志们一起排练，参加演出。整个演出的几分钟内，刘才每做一个动作，每演唱一句，都强烈地感动着大家。同志们说：刘才宣传的是“老三篇”，他本身就是活学活用“老三篇”的好榜样啊！
