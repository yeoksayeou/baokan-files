Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, receiving revolutionary fighters is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest trust, and greatest spur for the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the nation. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new merits.

Great helmsman Chairman Mao, revolutionary fighters will forever be loyal to you. We will continue to carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by you personally, further study and apply your brilliant thoughts, implement your latest instructions thoroughly and completely, and be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending your latest instructions.

Great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Comrade Zhou Enlai, warmly greeted all the revolutionary fighters in the audience. This is our happiest moment. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, redouble our efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and continue to make progress. We will seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.
