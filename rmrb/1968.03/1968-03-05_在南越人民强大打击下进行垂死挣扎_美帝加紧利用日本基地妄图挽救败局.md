The heroic military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have recently launched a powerful offensive, striking the U.S. imperialists with such force that they are now in a state of panic. In their desperate struggle, they are hastening to utilize their military bases in Okinawa and mainland Japan to salvage the situation.

Since February of this year, at the U.S. Air Force base in the central part of Okinawa, the Kadena base, American B-52 bombers and large transport planes have been taking off and landing around the clock, reaching up to 200 flights per day.

Recently, the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" revealed that the latest type of black spy planes have also been taking off and landing daily from the Kadena base.

The U.S. military base in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan, the Itazuke base, has also seen a tense atmosphere not witnessed in over a decade since early February. U.S. military aircraft frequently take off from there, transporting invasion troops and ammunition to South Vietnam. Similar situations have also been observed at the Horishima base and the Tachikawa base near Tokyo.

Recently, several ships from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which have participated in the Vietnam War, have frequently entered ports in western Japan, such as Sasebo and Hiroshima.

At the same time, a large number of U.S. tanks and armored vehicles damaged by the brave military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have been transported to Japan for repairs. The road from the U.S. military dock in Yokohama to the U.S. military repair factory in Sagamihara City, Kanagawa Prefecture, is still filled with U.S. military vehicles transporting battered tanks and armored vehicles to the repair factory late into the night.

The U.S. imperialists are attempting to recruit Japanese people to serve them in their efforts to salvage their failures on the Vietnam battlefield. Notably, they are recruiting not only dock workers but also so-called "medical researchers" for the "U.S. Army Medical Department 406th Medical Research Institute," which is involved in the evil biological warfare research.

However, the U.S. imperialists' evil deeds have been met with resolute resistance from the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Japanese people firmly oppose the U.S. using its military bases in Japan to frantically struggle and salvage its defeat in Vietnam. The struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam is surging across Japan.

### 在南越人民强大打击下进行垂死挣扎  美帝加紧利用日本基地妄图挽救败局

    在南越人民强大打击下进行垂死挣扎
    美帝加紧利用日本基地妄图挽救败局
    新华社东京电　被英雄的越南南方军民最近发动的强大攻势打得丧魂落魄的美帝国主义者，正在加紧利用它在冲绳和日本本土的军事基地，进行垂死挣扎。
    从今年二月以来，在冲绳中部的嘉手纳美国空军基地，美国B—52型轰炸机和大型运输机等军用飞机不分昼夜地起飞降落，每天达二百架次之多。
    最近，日本资产阶级报纸《读卖新闻》透露，美国新型的黑色间谍飞机，最近每天也在嘉手纳基地起飞降落。
    日本九州福冈县的板付基地，从二月初开始也出现了十多年来从未有过的紧张气氛。美国军用飞机频繁地从那里向南越运送侵略军队和弹药。东京附近的横田基地和立川基地，也出现了类似的情况。
    最近，一些参加侵越战争的美国第七舰队的舰只，多次闯入西日本一带的港口，如佐世保、广岛等。
    同时，被英勇的越南南方军民打坏的大量美国坦克和装甲车，也被运到日本修理。从横滨港的美军码头通往神奈川县相模原市的驻日美军修理厂的一条公路，到深夜还有很多美国军用车辆把破烂不堪的美军坦克和装甲车等运到修理厂去。
    美帝国主义正在设法招募日本人，为挽救它在越南战场上的失败效劳。值得注意的是，他们招募的人员，不仅有装卸工人，而且还有为美军研究罪恶的细菌战的机构——“美国陆军医疗本部第四零六医学研究所”效劳的所谓“医学研究人员”。
    但是，美帝国主义的这种罪恶行径遭到了广大日本人民的坚决抵制。日本人民坚决反对美国利用它在日本的军事基地进行疯狂挣扎，挽救侵越败局。日本各地反对美国侵略越南的斗争正在日益高涨。
