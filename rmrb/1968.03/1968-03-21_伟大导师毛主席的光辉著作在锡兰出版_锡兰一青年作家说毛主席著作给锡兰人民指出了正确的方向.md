The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, has had many of his brilliant works, including "On Contradiction," recently translated into Sinhala and Tamil and published in single-volume editions by the People's Publishing House in Ceylon. These works have been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of Ceylon.

The Sinhala single-volume editions include: "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work," "On Contradiction," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?", "On the Chongqing Negotiations," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and "On the Present Situation and Our Tasks."

The Tamil single-volume editions include: "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "The Spark Will Become a Prairie Fire," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work," and "On the Chongqing Negotiations," among others.

Previously, the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" had already been translated into Sinhala and Tamil and published in Colombo.

A young writer from Ceylon, Bandara, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao's works have pointed us in the right direction and provided the greatest and most precious help to the people. He said, "Chairman Mao's brilliant work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' has given me great inspiration. It teaches me for whom to write and how to write, and also teaches me to accept the correct things and criticize the wrong things."
