Female militia members fighting on the transportation lines have raised the stirring slogan, "We would rather shed blood and sacrifice ourselves, but the transportation lines must not be interrupted." Every time after enemy planes bomb, everyone grabs their hoes, shovels, and wooden planks and rushes to the roads to repair the transportation lines.

Once, the female militia squad leader Gao Mingzhi from a certain place was ordered to fill in the bomb craters created by enemy planes. Gao Mingzhi led the team to the work site and saw a very deep crater that had cut off the road. She exchanged ideas with everyone and, together with her comrades, started carrying wooden planks and picking up stones, determined to fill in the crater in the shortest time possible to restore the road to normal. Suddenly, American aggressor planes dropped flares in the sky, followed by bombing and strafing. Facing the enemy's savage acts, everyone was filled with indignation, and no one left their post. At that time, two nearby trucks caught fire after being hit. Gao Mingzhi, disregarding her own safety, rushed forward and, together with her comrades, bravely extinguished the flames and rescued the two trucks loaded with goods. After the enemy planes fled, they continued their battle and successfully completed the task of filling in the crater and repairing the road in just two hours. The road was reconnected, and convoy after convoy passed over the filled crater, heading towards the front lines where the battle raged.

    交通线上的女民兵
    战斗在交通运输线上的女民兵们提出了“宁可流血牺牲，交通决不中断”的响亮口号。每当敌机轰炸过后，人人都带着锄头、铁锹和木板奔向公路，修复交通线。
    有一次，某地女民兵中队长高明芝奉命填平敌机轰炸的弹坑。高明芝带领队伍到达工作地点后，只见一个很深的弹坑把公路切断了。她跟大伙交换了一下意见，就和同志们一起抬木板挑石块，决心在最短的时间内填平弹坑，使公路恢复畅通。突然，美国强盗飞机又在空中投掷照明弹，接着开始轰炸扫射。面对敌人的野蛮暴行，同志们个个义愤填膺，谁也没有离开战斗岗位。那时，附近有两辆卡车中弹起火，高明芝奋不顾身地冲上前去，勇敢地和同志们一起扑灭了烈火，抢救了这两辆满载货物的卡车。敌机逃遁后，她们又继续奋战，终于在两小时内就完成了填坑修路的任务。公路又接通了，一列列车队越过填平的弹坑奔向战火纷飞的前线。
