The Soviet revisionist clique's Minister of Defense, Grechko, recently at the "celebration" of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, brazenly declared: "Modern imperialism is far from being a 'paper tiger.'" A defense minister of a self-proclaimed socialist country, shamelessly cheering for imperialism, is truly despicable to the extreme!

Grechko took the opportunity of the "celebration" of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army to madly attack the brilliant truth that imperialism is a paper tiger. This is a blatant betrayal of the great Lenin and a severe insult to the glorious history of the Soviet Red Army. Fifty years ago, when the young Soviet state was in a critical moment, the young workers' and peasants' army bravely fought against the fully armed German imperialists and successfully defended the October Revolution. The Soviet Red Army was born in this struggle. The history of the Soviet Red Army itself proves that imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. As Lenin pointed out in 1919: "Imperialism, like an invincible giant, has become a 'giant with feet of clay' in everyone's eyes." Half a century has passed, imperialism has become even more decadent and decayed, while the revolutionary forces of the world have grown stronger than ever. However, the Soviet revisionist clique is doing everything it can to scare people with the "strength" of "modern imperialism," claiming that "modern imperialism" is definitely not a paper tiger. Such shameless acts can only be done by shameless traitors!

The Soviet revisionist clique's sudden appearance to cheer for imperialism at this time is certainly not accidental. The U.S. imperialists have been beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people on the battlefield in Vietnam, and their paper tiger nature has been fully exposed. It is precisely under these circumstances that the Soviet revisionist clique is eager to lend a hand to the U.S. imperialists, attempting to boost the morale of the U.S. imperialists, who are riddled with holes like a paper tiger, to intimidate the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world. The Soviet revisionist traitors are acting as henchmen for the U.S. imperialist paper tiger, indeed with good intentions.

Grechko, to cover up his ugly face, said that he seems to advocate correctly assessing imperialism and opposing underestimating the enemy. This is also nonsense. The Soviet revisionist clique does not regard imperialism as an enemy at all, but crawls at the feet of U.S. imperialism, willingly serving as a henchman and slave to U.S. imperialism. How can they talk about correctly assessing imperialism? To put it bluntly, the Soviet revisionist clique's shouting about imperialism having "nuclear teeth" and being "far from a paper tiger" is merely to find a fig leaf to cover their shameful acts of surrender and betrayal.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, pointing out that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. This great scientific conclusion and strategic thought have been proven by countless facts and have become a powerful ideological weapon for the billions of revolutionary people to defeat the enemy. The more the Soviet revisionist traitors madly attack this great thought, the more it proves the power of this great thought. Imperialism is a paper tiger, and the Soviet revisionist clique is also a paper tiger. They cannot save each other. Imperialism and all reactionaries will be overthrown and swept away by the world's revolutionary people who dare to struggle and are good at struggling. In the end, their "tiger skins" will be sent to the museum of history.

### 苏修叛徒为美帝纸老虎作伥

    苏修叛徒为美帝纸老虎作伥
    苏修集团的国防部长格列奇科，最近在“庆祝”苏联红军建军五十周年大会上大放厥词，直着脖子叫喊：“现代帝国主义远不是‘纸老虎’。”一个号称社会主义国家的国防部长，竟然这样卖力气地为帝国主义助威，真是无耻到了极点！
    格列奇科利用“庆祝”苏军五十周年的机会，疯狂攻击帝国主义是纸老虎这个光辉的真理，这是对伟大列宁的公然背叛，也是对苏联红军的光荣历史的极大侮辱。五十年前，当新生的苏维埃政权处于危急的时刻，年轻的工农军队英勇地抗击了全副武装的德国帝国主义的进攻，胜利地保卫了十月革命。苏联红军就是在这个斗争中光荣诞生的。苏联红军的历史本身就证明了帝国主义不过是纸老虎。正如列宁在一九一九年所指出：“象一个制服不了的巨人似的帝国主义，在大家眼中已成为‘泥足巨人’。”半个世纪过去了，帝国主义更加腐朽没落，而世界人民革命力量则空前壮大了。然而苏修集团却不遗余力地用“现代帝国主义”的“强大”来吓唬人，说什么“现代帝国主义”决不是纸老虎。这种不要脸的事情，只有不要脸的叛徒才干得出来！
    苏修集团在现在这个时候跳出来为帝国主义摇旗呐喊，当然不是偶然的。美帝国主义在越南战场上被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额，屁滚尿流，它这个纸老虎早就原形毕露。正是在这种情况下，苏修集团才急不可耐地要为美帝国主义出点力，妄想替美帝国主义这只千疮百孔的纸老虎长点威风，来吓唬越南人民和世界革命人民。苏修叛徒为美帝纸老虎作伥，可谓用心良苦。
    格列奇科为了掩饰他的丑恶面目，说什么他似乎是主张正确估计帝国主义，而反对“对敌人估计不足”。这也是鬼话。苏修集团根本就不把帝国主义当作敌人，而是匍匐在美帝国主义的脚下，甘心充当美帝国主义的帮凶和奴仆，哪里还谈得上什么正确估计帝国主义？拆穿了说，苏修集团大叫大嚷什么帝国主义有“核牙齿”呀，“远不是纸老虎”呀，其目的之一，不过是想替他们的投降叛卖的可耻行径，找一块遮羞布而已。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，指出帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。这个伟大的科学论断和战略思想，已为无数的事实所证明，成为亿万革命人民战胜敌人的强大思想武器。苏修叛徒越是拚命攻击这个伟大思想，就越是证明了这个伟大思想的威力。帝国主义是纸老虎，苏修集团也是纸老虎，它们谁也救不了谁。帝国主义和一切反动派，都将被敢于斗争、善于斗争的世界革命人民所打倒，所推翻，最后它们的“虎皮”必将被送进历史博物馆。
