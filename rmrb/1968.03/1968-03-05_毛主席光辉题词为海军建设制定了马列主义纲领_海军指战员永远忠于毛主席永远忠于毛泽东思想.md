“To counter imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy.”

Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription sets the Marxist-Leninist blueprint for naval construction; naval officers and soldiers forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The officers and soldiers of the East China Fleet and representatives from various naval units held a grand meeting in Shanghai to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's first inspection of the naval fleet. They resolved to better study Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, and to forge ahead along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao attended the meeting and delivered a speech. The following is a summary of his remarks.

The great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice of inspecting the naval fleet from February 19 to 24, 1953, wrote the most brilliant and magnificent chapter in the history of the people's navy and the construction of the People's Liberation Army. This was the happiest day that all officers and soldiers of the naval units would never forget. During the inspection, Chairman Mao lived with the officers and soldiers on the ships for four days and three nights, reviewed the naval units, watched the torpedo boat maneuvers, convened a cadre meeting, and delivered important instructions. He also wrote the brilliant inscription: "To counter imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy," setting a Marxist-Leninist guideline for naval construction. During the inspection, Chairman Mao visited various compartments and battle stations on many ships, had cordial conversations with cadres and soldiers, and showed great concern for the political progress of cadres and soldiers, as well as the revolutionary construction and growth of the units. Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice of caring for the masses, believing in the masses, and respecting the masses' revolutionary initiative will forever inspire the naval units to advance courageously on the road of revolution and modernization.

The great leader Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist guideline for naval construction most vividly expresses the aspirations of the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution. This great guideline is being realized, and our naval construction has achieved tremendous successes. In the process of realizing this guideline, we inevitably encounter resistance from the bourgeoisie. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have done everything in their power to sabotage the implementation of this guideline. After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have finally been exposed. This meeting marks the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the further implementation of Chairman Mao's great guideline, and the further strengthening of our national defense construction.

Comrade Lin Biao has always urged us to study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice. The great leader Chairman Mao's first inspection of the naval fleet set a shining example for us with his great revolutionary practice. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a better job of the "three supports and two militaries," seize the revolution, promote preparedness, and give a resounding blow to U.S. imperialism and all enemies who dare to invade. We will strive for new achievements in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, March 4th

The officers and soldiers of the East China Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy and representatives from various naval units held a grand meeting in Shanghai on February 22nd to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's first inspection of the naval fleet. They resolved to study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and advance courageously along the great revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice of inspecting the naval fleet from February 19 to 24, 1953, wrote the most brilliant and magnificent chapter in the history of the people's navy and the construction of the People's Liberation Army. This was the happiest day that all officers and soldiers of the naval units would never forget. During the inspection, Chairman Mao lived with the officers and soldiers on the ships for four days and three nights, reviewed the naval units, watched the torpedo boat maneuvers, convened a cadre meeting, and delivered important instructions. He also wrote the brilliant inscription: "To counter imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy," setting a Marxist-Leninist guideline for naval construction. During the inspection, Chairman Mao visited various compartments and battle stations on many ships, had cordial conversations with cadres and soldiers, and showed great concern for the political progress of cadres and soldiers, as well as the revolutionary construction and growth of the units. Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice of caring for the masses, believing in the masses, and respecting the masses' revolutionary initiative will forever inspire the naval units to advance courageously on the road of revolution and modernization.

"The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The broad officers and soldiers of the naval units regard studying Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice as an important part of studying Mao Zedong Thought. This meeting is a mobilization meeting for the officers and soldiers to push the activity of studying Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice to a new high, and it is a rallying meeting for them to resolve to build a powerful people's navy that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The meeting venue, a certain naval wharf in Shanghai, was festive. The ships that had the honor of being inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao 15 years ago were adorned in festive attire. The naval soldiers held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsman" with all their hearts, repeatedly wishing "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" The slogan "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line" echoed over the Huangpu River.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, the second political commissar of the Navy, Comrade Wang Hongkun, and leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the three military forces stationed in Shanghai attended the meeting. Participants also included active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, war heroes Mei Xiande, Shu Jicheng, active learner of Chairman Mao's works Zhang Yimin, and representatives from the Navy's 441st Unit Party Committee who firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the struggle between the two lines. Fifteen years ago, old sailors who crossed the great voyage with Chairman Mao also came from various fronts such as coastal defense, inland, factories, and rural areas to participate in the meeting.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao spoke at the meeting, extending the warmest congratulations to the attendees and to all officers and soldiers of the East China Fleet. He said, 15 years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao first inspected the naval fleet and gave the most important instructions and the most brilliant inscription: "To counter imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy." This Marxist-Leninist guideline for naval construction most vividly expresses the aspirations of the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution. The great guideline set by Chairman Mao is being realized, and our naval construction has achieved tremendous successes. In the process of realizing this guideline, we inevitably encounter resistance from the bourgeoisie. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have done everything in their power to sabotage the implementation of this guideline. After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have finally been exposed. We are holding this meeting, which marks the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the further implementation of Chairman Mao's great guideline, and the further strengthening of our national defense construction.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said that in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the officers and soldiers of the East China Fleet have achieved great successes in the "three supports and two militaries" work. He hoped that everyone would firmly implement the policy of "supporting the left but not supporting factions" and do a better job of the "three supports and two militaries."

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao encouraged the naval officers and soldiers to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seize the revolution, promote preparedness, and give a resounding blow to U.S. imperialism and all enemies who dare to invade. He urged them to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and strive for new achievements in its comprehensive victory.

The second political commissar of the Navy, Comrade Wang Hongkun, spoke at the meeting on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Navy, making a solemn pledge to Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao: They would definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Wang Hongkun explained the great significance of the construction guideline set by Chairman Mao for the Navy in his speech. He said, why do we need to build a powerful Navy? Chairman Mao clearly instructed us that it is to counter imperialist aggression. This is Chairman Mao's consistent strategic thinking. Whether or not to counter imperialism led by the United States is a fundamental indicator of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao and can maintain the revolutionary nature of the proletarian army.

Comrade Wang Hongkun said that the people's Navy must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly walk the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. Whether to emphasize politics or military affairs is the fundamental difference between the two military lines. Emphasizing politics is fundamentally to let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead and achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking. Comrade Wang Hongkun angrily criticized the revisionist line proposed by China's Khrushchev through the so-called "inscription," which aimed to completely remove the revolutionary soul and class content from naval construction. Comrade Wang Hongkun said that China is the strongest base for world revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the strongest main force against imperialism. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and build a powerful Navy to counter imperialist aggression. This powerful Navy will not only gradually master more modern weapons and equipment but, more importantly, will have the characteristic of emphasizing proletarian politics, truly master the invincible and powerful Mao Zedong Thought, and have the highest level of revolutionization.

Comrade Wang Hongkun said that Comrade Lin Biao has always urged us to study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice. The great leader Chairman Mao's first inspection of the naval fleet set a shining example for us with his great revolutionary practice. We must not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's great concern, seriously study the great leader Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and carry out a great mass movement to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, heighten our vigilance, strengthen preparedness, be ready to annihilate invading enemies at any time, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian dictatorship, and the socialist cause to the death! We will forever advance courageously along the great course opened by Chairman Mao!

Mei Xiande, Shu Jicheng, Zhang Yimin, Wu Yi, and representatives of old sailors and the three military forces stationed in Shanghai also spoke at the meeting, full of revolutionary passion, praising the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and praising the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, we have a thousand pieces of experience, ten thousand pieces of experience, and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's line and policy is the most important experience; we have a thousand examples, ten thousand examples, and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice is our most shining example.

The meeting read out the order from the naval leadership to confer honorary titles on the ships that had the honor of being inspected by Chairman Mao 15 years ago.

The meeting ended with the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    “为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”
    毛主席光辉题词为海军建设制定了马列主义纲领  海军指战员永远忠于毛主席永远忠于毛泽东思想
    东海舰队指战员和海军各部队代表隆重集会，纪念伟大统帅毛主席首次视察海军舰艇部队十五周年，决心更好地学习毛泽东思想和毛主席的伟大革命实践，以林副主席为光辉榜样，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道破浪前进。张春桥同志出席了大会并讲了话内容提要
    伟大统帅毛主席一九五三年二月十九日到二十四日首次视察海军舰艇部队的伟大革命实践，在人民海军建设史上，也是在人民解放军的建设史上写下了最光辉、最壮丽的篇章。这是海军部队全体指战员终生难忘的最幸福的日子。在视察中，毛主席在舰艇上同指战员一起生活了四天三夜，检阅了舰艇部队，观看了鱼雷快艇的操演，召开了干部会，在会上作了重要指示，并写下了“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”的光辉题词，为海军建设制定了一条马克思列宁主义的总方针。毛主席在视察中，走遍了许多舰艇的各个舱室和战位，同干部战士亲切谈话，无微不至地关心干部战士的政治进步，关心部队的革命化建设和成长。毛主席最关心群众、最相信群众、最尊重群众的革命首创精神，毛主席和群众心连心的伟大革命实践，永远鼓舞着海军部队在革命化、现代化的道路上奋勇前进。
    伟大统帅毛主席制定的这个马克思列宁主义的海军建设纲领，最集中地表达了中国人民和世界革命人民的愿望。这一伟大纲领正在实现，我国的海军建设已经取得了巨大的成就。在实现这一纲领的过程中，不能不遇到来自资产阶级方面的反抗。党内最大的一小撮走资派千方百计要破坏这个纲领的实现。经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，党内最大的一小撮走资派终于被揪出来了。这个大会，标志着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，标志着毛主席的伟大纲领的进一步落实，标志着我国国防建设的进一步加强。
    林副主席一向号召我们，要努力学习毛主席的伟大革命实践。伟大统帅毛主席首次视察海军舰艇部队，就是以他的伟大革命实践为我们树立了最光辉的典范。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，抓革命，促战备，狠狠打击美帝国主义和一切敢于来犯的敌人，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
      新华社上海四日电　中国人民解放军海军东海舰队指战员和海军各部队代表，怀着对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，二月二十二日在上海隆重举行大会，纪念伟大统帅毛主席首次视察海军舰艇部队十五周年，决心学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，以林副主席为光辉榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，沿着毛主席开辟的伟大革命航道奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大统帅毛主席一九五三年二月十九日到二十四日首次视察海军舰艇部队的伟大革命实践，在人民海军建设史上，也是在人民解放军的建设史上写下了最光辉、最壮丽的篇章，这是海军部队全体指战员终生难忘的最幸福的日子。在视察中，毛主席在舰艇上同指战员一起生活了四天三夜，检阅了舰艇部队，观看了鱼雷快艇的操演，召开了干部会，在会上作了重要指示，并写下了
  “为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”的光辉题词，为海军建设制定了一条马克思列宁主义的总方针。毛主席在视察中，走遍了许多舰艇的各个舱室和战位，同干部战士亲切谈话，无微不至地关心干部战士的政治进步，关心部队的革命化建设和成长。毛主席最关心群众、最相信群众、最尊重群众的革命首创精神，毛主席和群众心连心的伟大革命实践，永远鼓舞着海军部队在革命化、现代化的道路上奋勇前进。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”海军部队广大指战员把学习毛主席的伟大革命实践作为学习毛泽东思想的重要内容。这次大会，就是指战员们把学习毛主席的伟大革命实践的活动推向新高潮的动员大会，是他们决心建设一支强大的忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人民海军的誓师大会。大会会场、上海某海军码头一片节日景象，当年光荣接受伟大统帅毛主席首次视察的一艘艘舰艇，披上了节日的盛装。海军战士们手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》，一遍遍祝愿“毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”“永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线”的口号声响彻黄浦江上空。
    张春桥同志，海军第二政委王宏坤同志出席大会并讲了话。上海市革命委员会领导成员、驻沪三军负责人也出席了大会。参加大会的还有海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、战斗英雄麦贤得、舒积成，海军学习毛主席著作积极分子张逸民，在两条路线斗争中坚决捍卫毛主席革命路线的海军四四一一部队党委代表武毅。十五年前，同毛主席一起渡过伟大航程的老舰员，也从海防、内地、工厂和农村等各条战线赶来参加大会。
    张春桥同志在会上讲话，向到会的同志，向东海舰队全体指战员表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，十五年前，我们伟大统帅毛主席首次视察海军舰艇部队并作了最最重要的指示，作了最最光辉的题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”。这个马克思列宁主义的海军建设纲领，最集中地表达了中国人民和世界革命人民的愿望。毛主席制定的这一伟大纲领正在实现，我国的海军建设已经取得了巨大的成就。在实现这一纲领的过程中，不能不遇到来自资产阶级方面的反抗。党内最大的一小撮走资派千方百计要破坏这个纲领的实现。经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，党内最大的一小撮走资派终于被揪出来了，我们召开这个大会，标志着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，标志着毛主席的伟大纲领的进一步落实，标志着我国国防建设的进一步加强。
    张春桥同志说，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，东海舰队指战员在“三支”“两军”工作中取得了很大的成绩，希望大家坚决执行“支左不支派”的方针，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。
    张春桥同志勉励海军指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，抓革命，促战备，狠狠打击美帝国主义和一切敢于来犯的敌人，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命、夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
    海军第二政治委员王宏坤同志在会上代表海军全体指战员，向伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友、副统帅林彪同志庄严宣誓：一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    王宏坤同志在讲话中阐述了毛主席为海军规定的建设方针的伟大意义。他说，为什么要建立强大的海军？毛主席明确地指示我们，是为了反对帝国主义的侵略。这是毛主席的一贯战略思想。要不要、敢不敢反对以美国为首的帝国主义，这是忠不忠于毛主席、能不能保持无产阶级军队革命本质的根本标志之一。
    王宏坤同志说，人民海军必须遵照毛主席的教导，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。是突出政治，还是突出军事，这是两条军事路线的根本分歧。突出政治，最根本的就是要毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化。王宏坤同志愤怒批判了中国赫鲁晓夫通过所谓“题词”提出的建设海军是为了“发展我国海洋事业”、妄图完全抽掉海军建设的革命灵魂和阶级内容的修正主义方针。王宏坤同志说，我国是世界革命最强大的根据地。中国人民解放军是反对帝国主义的最强大的主力军。我们一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，为了反对帝国主义的侵略，建立强大的海军。这支强大的海军将不但要逐步掌握更多的现代化的武器装备，而且更重要的是要以突出无产阶级政治为特点，真正掌握威力无比的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，具有最高度的革命化水平。
    王宏坤同志说，林副主席一向号召我们，要努力学习毛主席的伟大革命实践。伟大统帅毛主席首次视察海军舰艇部队，就是以他的伟大革命实践为我们树立了最光辉的典范。我们一定不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的巨大关怀，认真学习伟大统帅毛主席的伟大革命实践，更加深入地、持久地开展以林副主席为光辉榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线的伟大群众运动。坚决响应毛主席关于抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备的伟大号召，百倍提高警惕，切实加强战备，随时准备消灭来犯敌人，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命，誓死保卫无产阶级专政，誓死保卫社会主义江山，永远沿着毛主席指引的伟大航程奋勇前进！
    麦贤得、舒积成、张逸民、武毅以及老舰员代表和驻沪三军代表等也先后在会上讲了话，满怀革命激情，大赞大颂伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的伟大革命实践，大赞大颂毛泽东思想的无比威力。他们说，我们有一千条经验，一万条经验，坚决执行毛主席的方针路线，是最最重要的经验；我们有一千个榜样，一万个榜样，毛主席的伟大革命实践，是我们最最光辉的榜样。
    会上，宣读了海军领导机关授予当年接受毛主席视察的舰艇以荣誉称号的命令。
    大会在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声中，通过了给伟大统帅毛主席的致敬电。
