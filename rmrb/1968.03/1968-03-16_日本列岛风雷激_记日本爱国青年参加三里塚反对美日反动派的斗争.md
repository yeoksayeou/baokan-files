Thunderous storms are sweeping across the Japanese archipelago. Following the struggles at Haneda Airport last year and at Sasebo this January, the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement has reached an unprecedented new stage in the Sanrizuka struggle. In this fight against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' construction of an "international" airport to serve U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Asia, a contingent of young students, waving the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed a spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. They have engaged in courageous and clever combat with the fascist police, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the Japanese people.

The Red Flag of "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" Flutters in the Wind

On March 10, Japanese patriotic youth students rushed to Sanrizuka near Chiba City, where they held a massive protest rally and demonstration with local farmers. They resolutely opposed the pro-American, traitorous Sato government's seizure of farmers' land to build a military airport.

A Japanese revolutionary youth, holding high a bright red banner with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," swiftly penetrated the enemy's water curtain and police barricades, crossing one iron wire fence and obstacle after another, and successfully charged into the Chiba City Hall and the "Airport Construction Company" courtyard. The Japanese reactionary authorities were terrified out of their wits.

This "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" red banner brought boundless strength to the Japanese farmers, workers, youth, and women participating in the struggle. Under this banner, which fluttered in the wind, they engaged in fierce combat with the fully armed Japanese police. Armed with wooden sticks and stones, they powerfully countered the police's bloody suppression.

That night, the Japanese police conducted a massive roundup of participants in the struggle in Chiba City. Under these circumstances, a participant in the struggle quickly hid the "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" red banner in the home of a completely unfamiliar common person. This family, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, eagerly accepted this honorable task and, at great risk, carefully preserved the precious red banner. The next day, the red banner was safely returned to the hands of the activist, continuing to guide the Japanese patriotic youth forward to victory!

The Japanese youth who held high the "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" red banner told a Chinese reporter that, inspired by the glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, he deeply understood that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time. He had always seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. Through studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he resolved to throw himself into the Japanese revolution. He said, "To struggle for the Japanese revolution, one may have to sacrifice oneself. But as Chairman Mao teaches, 'People all want to live. This is a fact. But for what end are we to live? For individual fame and gain? For the reactionary ruling class? Or for the people? For socialism? For communism?' This youth solemnly declared: 'I am willing to devote myself to the Japanese revolution, even if it means sacrificing my life.'"

Engaging in a Head-to-Head Struggle with the U.S.-Japan Reactionaries

The flames of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle are burning more fiercely, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy. The mad Sato reactionary government attempted to extinguish this blazing fire, using extremely savage fascist methods.

On that day, a white terror atmosphere hung over the Chiba City area. The Japanese reactionary police authorities set up several checkpoints at many train stations and intersections leading to Chiba City, forcing pedestrians and vehicles to stop and checking for the transport of wooden sticks and stones. The Japanese reactionary police authorities thought that by doing so, they could prevent the unarmed Japanese patriotic youth students from defending themselves and allow them to be brutally suppressed. However, contrary to the police's expectations, a contingent of patriotic youth students participating in the struggle suddenly changed from being unarmed to each holding a wooden stick at the start of the protest rally. It turned out that these sticks had been secretly moved into a dormitory near the venue a few days earlier. Before the meeting, they had secretly brought them into the venue in small groups, unbeknownst to the Japanese police. They used these sticks to teach the police a lesson.

The Japanese reactionary government, frightened by the heroic Japanese people, not only deployed armed police to madly launch tear gas and water cannons at the youth, students, workers, and farmers, but also used several times more fully armed police to brutally surround and arrest protesters, injuring thousands of people and illegally arresting nearly two hundred. At this moment of brutal suppression, a contingent of youth waving the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought immediately linked arms to form a defensive line and sang "The Internationale," protesting against the enemy's fascist suppression. A young woman whose head was beaten by a Japanese policeman's baton said: The enemy thinks that by using such savage suppression, they can make us afraid and stop participating in the anti-American struggle. But they are wrong! They hit my head with a stick, but I am not afraid. At that moment, I only felt a surge of hatred! They did this, but it only strengthened my fighting spirit. I will continue to struggle!

A Waseda University student, speaking about their feelings during the struggle, said that Chairman Mao teaches us that the enemy is sharpening their knives, and we must also sharpen ours. Through the struggle, I have come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, and Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest ideological weapon for fighting against American imperialism. This young student emphasized: If you stand on the side of the revolution, you must arm yourself with Mao Zedong Thought. It is the brilliant thought of "Resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, do not fear sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory" that has further strengthened our resolve to struggle.

Going Among the Workers and Peasants to Unite with Them

Japanese revolutionary youth students gradually came to realize through the struggle that to further develop the anti-American patriotic struggle, they must implement the policy of uniting with the workers and peasants and going among the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches: "How do we judge whether a youth is revolutionary? How do we distinguish between the revolutionary and the non-revolutionary youth? We must judge them by actual deeds and not by words. There can only be one criterion, namely, whether he is willing to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants or not. Those who are willing to do so are revolutionary; those who are not willing to do so are non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary."

In the ranks of the struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' construction of the Sanrizuka military airport, a group of intellectual youth, following Chairman Mao's teachings, began last spring to go to Sanrizuka every week for two days, persistently practicing the "four unities" with the farmers—eating together, living together, laboring together, and struggling together. They greatly strengthened their combat friendship with the laboring people through their activities in the countryside.

A Japanese youth said: "We went to the countryside, on the one hand, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the farmers, and on the other hand, we learned a lot from the farmers' struggle, which was very helpful in overcoming the influence of revisionist ideology on us." He said: "This time, we were able to fight side by side with the farmers of Sanrizuka under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and we feel honored." This group of revolutionary youth students expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words for life. They will continue to deepen their work among the workers and peasants on the basis of this struggle.

The brave struggle of Japanese patriotic youth students, workers, and farmers has won the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people. On that day, tens of thousands of people came to Chiba City to support their struggle. When the Japanese reactionary police brutally beat and arrested the youth students, many people took the initiative to bring the injured young men and women students to their homes, providing them with warm and meticulous care, greatly inspiring and educating the youth students.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches: "The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

Thunderous storms are sweeping across the Japanese archipelago. Although there will still be various difficulties on the road ahead for the Japanese people, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the fighting Japanese people will definitely defeat the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and achieve final victory.

### 日本列岛风雷激——记日本爱国青年参加三里塚反对美日反动派的斗争

　　日本列岛风雷激
    ——记日本爱国青年参加三里塚反对美日反动派的斗争
    日本列岛春雷滚滚。日本人民的反美爱国运动继去年下半年的羽田机场斗争和今年一月的佐世保斗争之后，又在千叶县的三里塚斗争中出现了前所未有的崭新局面。在这场反对美日反动派修建为美帝侵略亚洲政策服务的所谓“国际”机场的斗争中，有一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的青年学生队伍，发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，同法西斯警察进行了英勇机智的搏斗，大大地鼓舞了日本人民的斗志。
    “毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗迎风招展
    三月十日，日本爱国青年学生赶到三里塚附近的成田市同当地农民一起举行了声势浩大的抗议集会和示威游行，坚决反对亲美卖国的佐藤政府强占农民土地修建军用机场。
    一位日本革命青年，高举着写有“毛泽东思想万岁”字样的鲜艳夺目的大红旗，在战友们的掩护下，神速地穿过敌人水龙的严密封锁，越过日本警察设下的一道又一道的铁丝网和障碍物，胜利地冲进了成田市政府和“机场建筑公司”的院内，吓得日本反动当局丧魂落魄。
    这面“毛泽东思想万岁”红旗，给参加斗争的日本农民、工人、青年、妇女带来了无穷的力量。他们在这面迎风招展的红旗下，同全副武装的日本警察进行了激烈的斗争。他们以木棒和石块为自卫武器，有力地反击警察的血腥镇压。
    当天晚上，日本警察在成田市对参加斗争的群众进行大搜捕。在这种情况下，一位参加斗争的活动家机警地把那面“毛泽东思想万岁”红旗暂时寄存在一个完全陌生的老百姓家里。这家老百姓怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，欣然地接受了这个光荣的任务，冒着危险妥善地把那面珍贵的红旗保存起来。第二天，这面红旗安然地回到了那位活动家的手里，继续指引着日本爱国青年胜利前进！
    那位高举着“毛泽东思想万岁”红旗的日本青年对中国记者说，他在中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利的鼓舞下，深刻地认识到毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。他一直认真地学习毛主席著作。通过学习《为人民服务》，使他下定决心投身到日本革命中去。他说，要为日本革命奋斗，就有可能牺牲自己。但是正如毛主席教导的那样：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”这位青年庄严地说：“我要为日本革命献身，即使牺牲了也心甘情愿。”
　　同美日反动派展开针锋相对的斗争
    日本人民反美爱国斗争的烈火越烧越旺，吓得敌人心惊胆战。丧心病狂的佐藤反动政府妄图扑灭这场熊熊烈火，使用了极其野蛮的法西斯手段。
    十日这一天，成田市一带笼罩着白色恐怖的气氛。日本反动警察当局在通往成田市的许多火车站和路口上安置了好几道岗哨，强迫行人和车辆停下来，检查是否搬运木棒和石块。日本反动警察当局满以为这样就可以使赤手空拳的日本爱国青年学生无法进行自卫，任凭它们血腥镇压。但是，出乎警察的预料之外，参加斗争的一支爱国青年学生队伍在抗议集会开始时，突然由原来的赤手空拳变成人人手持木棒。原来，这些木棒是几天前就秘密地搬进了会场附近的一个宿舍里。在大会举行之前，他们又在日本警察不知不觉间化整为零地带进了会场内。他们用这些木棒教训前来镇压他们的警察。
    被英雄的日本人民吓破了胆的日本反动政府，不仅出动武装警察丧心病狂地施放催泪弹和喷射瓦斯水袭击青年、学生、工人和农民，而且用几倍于群众的全副武装警察对抗议集会的人们，实行野蛮的围攻和大逮捕，打伤了上千名群众，并非法逮捕了近两百人。就在这遭到残酷镇压的时刻，有一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的青年队伍，立刻手挽着手结成一道防线，并高唱《国际歌》，抗议敌人的法西斯镇压。一个被日本警察用木棍打破了头部的女青年说：敌人用这样野蛮镇压的办法想要我们产生惧怕心理，不再参加反美斗争。但是，他们打错了算盘！敌人用木棒乱打我的头，可是我一点也不怕。当时，只是有一股仇恨涌上心头！他们这样干，反而使我增强了斗志。我要坚持斗争！
    一位早稻田大学的学生在谈到他们进行斗争的心情时说，毛主席教导我们说，敌人在磨刀，我们也要磨刀。通过斗争，我更加认识到毛泽东思想是真理，毛泽东思想是进行反美斗争的最锐利的思想武器。这位青年学生强调说：你要是站在革命的一边，你就必须用毛泽东思想武装自己。是毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的光辉思想，使他们进一步坚定了斗争信心。
    到工农群众中去与工农相结合
    日本革命青年学生在斗争中逐步地认识到，要进一步开展反美爱国斗争，就必须实行同工农相结合，到工农群众中去。
    毛主席教导说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”
    在反对美日反动派修建三里塚军用机场的斗争行列中，有一批知识青年就是遵照毛主席的这一教导，从去年春天开始，每隔一星期到三里塚两天，坚持同农民实行四同，同农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同斗争。他们在深入农村的活动中大大地加强了同劳动人民的战斗友谊。
    一位日本青年说：“我们下农村，一方面向农民宣传毛泽东思想，另一方面又从农民的斗争中学习了很多的东西，对克服我们从修正主义思潮那里受到的影响有很大的好处。”他说：“这次我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，能够同三里塚的农民一起并肩战斗，感到光荣。”这一批革命青年学生，表示要一辈子听毛主席的话。他们要在这次斗争的基础上继续深入工农。
    日本爱国青年学生、工人和农民的英勇斗争，得到了广大日本人民的支持。十日那一天，有上万人到成田市声援他们的斗争。当日本反动警察野蛮殴打和逮捕青年学生时，有不少人主动地把被警察打伤了的青年男女学生接到自己家里，无微不至地热情照料，使青年学生们受到极大的鼓舞和教育。
    伟大导师毛主席教导说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    日本列岛风雷激。尽管在日本人民的前进道路上还会有这样或那样的困难，但是，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，战斗的日本人民一定会打倒美日反动派，取得最后胜利。
                                        新华社记者（附图片）
    日本革命青年牢记世界人民的伟大导师毛主席的教导，高举革命无罪、造反有理的大旗，大造美日反动派和日共修正主义集团的反。
