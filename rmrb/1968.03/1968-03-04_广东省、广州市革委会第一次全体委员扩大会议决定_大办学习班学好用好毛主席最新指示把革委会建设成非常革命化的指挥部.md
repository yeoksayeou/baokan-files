The revolutionary committees of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City recently held their first expanded meeting of all committee members. The meeting decided to build the revolutionary committees into extremely revolutionary and extremely combat-ready proletarian command centers. The meeting mobilized and organized the people of the entire province and city to, with the greatest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the greatest effort, fully implement the series of extremely important latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to turn Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The committee members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, representatives of the People's Liberation Army tasked with "three supports, two militaries," and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations unanimously agreed that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest requirement of our era and the highest requirement of the people of the entire country. For every revolutionary, this is the highest class consciousness, the greatest political principle, the purest proletarian party spirit, and the most fundamental revolutionary integrity. They recalled the year-long battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, deeply feeling that following Chairman Mao is victory, and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. Seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party relied on Mao Zedong Thought; now, to hold and use power well, it is even more necessary to rely on Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary committees of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have just been established, facing a myriad of tasks, but the most fundamental task is to grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics.

This meeting focused on studying how to establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The meeting believed that vigorously establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes and learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the current main task of the revolutionary committees. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the sharpest weapons for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary committees should, through establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, firmly grasp the power to study, execute, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continuously raise the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire province and city to a new level, and raise the revolutionization of people's thinking to a new height. Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes is not a temporary measure but a key issue in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It should be persistently carried out in the future. From cities to rural areas, from schools to offices, from factories to neighborhoods, study classes should be established at all levels, everywhere, repeatedly, and for the long term. The scale should be large, the pace should be fast, and it should be done comprehensively and yield results everywhere. Study classes organized by mass organizations should be jointly established by all factions. Study classes with a combination of ordinary masses, leaders of mass organizations, and revolutionary leading cadres should be established, solving one or two major problems each time.

The participants in the meeting believed that to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the most important thing is to vigorously promote the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao himself, which is to link theory with practice. Learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions is loyalty to Chairman Mao and is truly a proletarian revolutionary; learning but not applying is disloyalty to Chairman Mao and is a verbal revolutionary. Everyone used Chairman Mao's latest instructions to examine the current situation of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, emphasizing that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism are reactionary social trends, are political bridges to counter-revolution, and are the main obstacles to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and the struggle between revolutionary organizational discipline and reactionary anarchism, in the stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieving comprehensive victory, have become the main forms of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. To establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes and truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in thought, it is necessary to resolutely fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and reactionary anarchism, thoroughly expose and overthrow them.

The participants in the meeting unanimously pointed out that Guangdong Province is located on the front line of national defense, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau. Foreign imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, along with domestic class enemies, are colluding to eye the newly born revolutionary committees, seeking opportunities to sabotage. Currently, a handful of class enemies are using factionalism and anarchism to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, we must be even more vigilant and resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, unite as one, and fight against the enemy. This not only helps to consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship but also helps to support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British and anti-violence struggles and support the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

To lead the masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, one must first dare to revolutionize oneself. The participants in the meeting spent most of their time using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to carry out self-criticism and criticize revisionism. The committee members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees realized that only by revolutionizing their own thinking can they build the revolutionary committees into strong command centers that can lead the revolutionary people of the entire province and city to fight against class enemies, and lead the revolutionary people of the entire province and city to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They believed that an important issue facing the revolutionary committees now is: to hold power with proletarian party spirit or to hold power with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Holding power with party spirit is to hold power with Mao Zedong Thought; holding power with factionalism is to hold power with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought. The revolutionary committee is a temporary power organ of the proletarian dictatorship. It is not a federation of factions nor a liaison station for mass organizations. Every member of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees should be a representative of the revolutionary people of the entire province and city, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions, honestly following Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the most fundamental stance, the most precious quality, the greatest ability, the greatest skill, and the most qualified public servant. Members of the revolutionary committee are not allowed to be representatives of any faction, serving the interests of any faction.

The meeting also discussed the issue of revolutionizing leadership style, requiring all members of the revolutionary committee to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, forever maintain and carry forward the fine style of hard work, forever not separate from labor, forever not engage in special treatment, and forever diligently work hard. They must resolutely resist extravagance and waste, laziness, and the pursuit of fame and profit, which are the evil styles of the bourgeoisie. They must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Be both an 'official' and a common person," maintain close ties with the masses, preserve the character of an ordinary laborer, establish a new style of revolutionary efficiency, and ensure that while positions change, the thought of serving the people never changes.

During the meeting, all participants, with deep class feelings of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, visited the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, which Chairman Mao once directed, and studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." Everyone had a deeper understanding of "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution." The participants in the meeting held a "Recall Bitterness and Think of Sweetness" meeting and ate a "bitterness meal" on the first day of the meeting; on the last day of the meeting, they participated in labor at the Huangpu Port wharf. Through these activities, everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm was higher, and they unanimously expressed that they would never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget emphasizing proletarian politics, never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life, forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    广东省、广州市革委会第一次全体委员扩大会议决定
    大办学习班学好用好毛主席最新指示把革委会建设成非常革命化的指挥部
    新华社广州三日电广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会最近联合召开第一次全体委员扩大会议。会议决定把革命委员会建设成为非常革命化、非常战斗化的无产阶级指挥部，动员和组织全省、全市人民，用最大的热情，最大的决心，最大的努力，全面落实我们伟大领袖毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把广东省、广州市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    参加会议的省、市革委会委员、担负“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军代表和革命群众组织负责人，一致认为：无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想，是我们时代的最高要求，是全国人民的最高要求。对于每一个革命者来说，这是最高的阶级觉悟，最大的政治原则，最纯的无产阶级党性，最根本的革命大节。他们回忆了广东省和广州市一年多来无产阶级文化大革命运动的战斗历程，深刻地体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利，掌握了毛泽东思想就所向无敌。从党内一小撮走资派手里夺权，靠的是毛泽东思想；现在要掌好权、用好权，更要靠毛泽东思想。广东省和广州市革命委员会刚刚成立，面临的任务千头万绪，但是，最根本的任务是要抓好活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治。
    这次会议着重研究了如何大办和办好毛泽东思想学习班的问题。会议认为，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，学好、用好毛主席的最新指示，是革命委员会当前的主要任务。毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最锐利的武器，革命委员会应该通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，牢牢地掌握好学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的权，不断地把全省、全市活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动提高到新的水平，把人的思想革命化提到新的高度。大办毛泽东思想学习班，决不是什么临时性的措施，而是全面落实毛主席最新指示的关键问题，今后也应该长期地坚持办下去。从城市到农村，从学校到机关，从工厂到街道，要层层办，处处办，反复办，长期办，规模要大，步伐要快，要做到全面开花，遍地结果。群众组织举办的学习班，应该各派联合办。要办有一般群众、群众组织负责人和革命领导干部参加的三结合的学习班，每次集中地解决一两个主要问题。
    参加会议的同志认为，办好毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，最重要的问题是要大兴毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风。对毛主席的最新指示，学了就用，就是忠于毛主席，就是真正的无产阶级革命派；学了不用，就是对毛主席不忠，就是口头革命派。大家用毛主席的最新指示对照检查了当前广东省和广州市文化大革命运动的情况，强调指出：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，是一种反动的社会思潮，是通向反革命的政治桥梁，是落实毛主席最新指示的主要障碍。无产阶级党性和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争，革命的组织纪律性和反动的无政府主义的斗争，在无产阶级文化大革命进入全面胜利的阶段，已经成为两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的主要表现形式。要办好毛泽东思想学习班，真正从思想上落实毛主席的最新指示，就必须同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和反动的无政府主义展开坚决的斗争，把它彻底搞臭，彻底打倒。
    参加会议的同志一致指出，广东省地处国防前线，毗邻港澳，国外帝、修、反和国内的阶级敌人正串通一气，对新诞生的革命委员会虎视眈眈，伺机破坏。当前，一小撮阶级敌人采取的阴谋手段是，利用派性和无政府主义，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。因此，我们更要百倍地提高革命的警惕性，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒无政府主义，团结一致，共同对敌。这不仅有利于巩固和加强无产阶级专政，而且有利于支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争，有利于支援越南人民抗美救国战争。
    要带领群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，首先自己要敢于革命，实现思想革命化。参加会议的人员用大部分时间，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，展开斗私批修活动。省、市革命委员会的委员们认识到，只有搞好自己的思想革命化，才能把革命委员会建设成为能够带领全省、全市革命人民向阶级敌人作斗争的坚强指挥部，才能领导全省、全市革命人民贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们认为，现在摆在革委会面前的一个重要问题是：用无产阶级党性掌权，还是用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性掌权。用党性掌权，就是用毛泽东思想掌权；用派性掌权，就是用资产阶级、小资产阶级思想掌权。革命委员会是无产阶级专政的临时权力机构，它不是各派的联合会，也不是群众组织的联络站。省、市革命委员会的每一个成员，都应该是全省、全市革命人民的代表，要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅自己的一切行动，老老实实地照毛主席的指示办事，这是最根本的立场，最宝贵的品质，最大的才能，最大的本事，最称职的人民勤务员。革命委员会的成员，决不允许成为那一派的代表，为那一派的利益服务。
    会议还讨论了领导作风革命化的问题，要求革命委员会全体成员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，永远保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风，永远不脱离劳动，永远不搞特殊化，永远勤勤恳恳地埋头苦干。要坚决抵制铺张浪费，好逸恶劳，争名争利的资产阶级恶劣作风。要遵照毛主席的伟大教导：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，密切联系群众，保持普通劳动者的本色，树立雷厉风行的革命新风尚，做到职务变，为人民服务的思想永不变。
    会议期间，全体同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，到毛主席当年主办的农民运动讲习所旧址，学习了毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》，大家对“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”，有了更深刻的体会。参加会议的同志，在会议第一天，举行了“忆苦思甜”讲用会，吃了“忆苦餐”；在会议的最后一天，到黄埔港码头参加了劳动。通过这些活动，大家革命热情更高，一致表示，要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，永远做毛主席的好战士，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
