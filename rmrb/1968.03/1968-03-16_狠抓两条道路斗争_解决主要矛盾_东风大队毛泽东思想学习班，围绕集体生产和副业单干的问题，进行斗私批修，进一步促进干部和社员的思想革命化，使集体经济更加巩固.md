Grasp the Struggle Between the Two Lines to Solve the Main Contradiction

The Dongfeng Brigade's Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, focusing on the issue of collective production versus individual sideline activities, conducted a campaign of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. This further promoted the ideological transformation of cadres and community members, making the collective economy more solid.

Editor's Note: The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grasp the revolution, promote production." The Dongfeng Brigade's study class, by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the struggle between the two lines, greatly raising the class consciousness of cadres and community members, and solving the long-standing problem of individual sideline activities. Furthermore, with this problem solved, other issues such as cadre unity and relations between cadres and the masses were promptly addressed. People's spiritual outlook has greatly improved, and spring plowing work is being carried out with great enthusiasm.

Some comrades have not correctly understood the relationship between revolution and production, often opposing the two. This is incorrect. The experience of the Dongfeng Brigade shows: to grasp the revolution, one must grasp the most influential issues, grasp issues of universal significance, and grasp the main contradictions in work. This helps cadres and the masses to elevate these issues to the level of the struggle between the two lines, two paths. By winning a political and ideological battle, everything else falls into place. Once the main problem is solved, other problems will be easily resolved.

Report from the People's Daily: How can a Mao Zedong Thought study class in rural areas achieve immediate results? The experience of the Dongfeng Brigade in Luotun Commune, Heishan County, Liaoning Province, is: the study class must have a clear purpose, with "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the guiding principle, concentrating on solving the main contradictions in the area, and driving the resolution of other issues. With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, this brigade firmly grasped the long-standing issue of individual weaving of mats in the struggle between the two lines, promoting a revolution in the hearts and minds of cadres and community members, further realizing the ideological transformation of people, solving the problem of individual weaving of mats, and smoothly resolving other issues.

When the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at this brigade, they were conducting a "Remember Bitterness, Think of Sweetness" activity. Through this activity, community members deepened their love for Chairman Mao and their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. At that time, among the big-character posters written by poor and lower-middle peasants to cadres, there was one titled "Which Path Should Dongfeng Brigade Take?" The question was sharply posed and immediately caught the attention of the propaganda team.

After careful investigation, the propaganda team learned that the struggle between the two lines in the Dongfeng Brigade was sharp and complex. The poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade had deep affection for Chairman Mao and were resolute in following Chairman Mao's socialist path. Many of them had been fighting against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies for a long time to uphold the socialist path. However, due to the long-term influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "self-reliance, self-management, and freedom in four aspects," individual weaving of mats became prevalent, with little concern for collective production. Some cadres adopted hardline and passive restrictive measures. Because the ideological issue was not resolved, the individual weaving trend could not be stopped, seriously affecting the unity among cadres and between cadres and the masses, and impacting the consolidation of the brigade's collective economy. An old poor peasant angrily said, "Individual weaving of mats is a stumbling block on the socialist path."

Based on Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp the class struggle as the key link, grasp the struggle between socialism and capitalism as the key link," the propaganda team discussed with the brigade's leadership and concluded: previous study classes had little effect mainly because they did not grasp the root cause, did not grasp the main contradiction, and only "moved the whiskers but not the roots."

How to grasp the root cause in the study class? After consulting with the masses, the propaganda team decided: brigade study classes, team study classes, militia study classes, and family study classes should all start with the issue of individual weaving of mats, guiding cadres and community members to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and sparking a revolution in their hearts and minds. Only in this way can they stand high, fight big, dig deep, and change in reality.

After determining the study content, the propaganda team first helped the cadres solve their ideological issues. They organized brigade and production team cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" and the "Three Articles," raising the cadres' class consciousness and awareness of line struggle. The militia company commander and brigade leadership team member Wang Jinpei, who had long opposed individual weaving of mats, took the lead in self-criticism during the study class. He said, "Previously, although I stopped my family from individually weaving mats and did some ideological and political work among the masses, I avoided the struggle and let it develop when I encountered difficulties. This actually gave the Chinese Khrushchev a green light to restore capitalism." Leadership team member Meng Qingde said, "In stopping individual weaving of mats, I had a lot of personal concerns. I knew that individual weaving of mats would definitely affect agricultural production, and I tried to solve it several times, but due to the great resistance from my family, relatives, and some community members, I was afraid of offending people, and eventually, I didn't care anymore. This was because I was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's 'self-reliance, self-management, and freedom in four aspects.' I will definitely take the lead in changing this." Following their lead, other cadres also engaged in fierce self-criticism during the study class, deeply excavating the roots of revisionism, and expressing their determination to lead the community members to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's socialist path.

The cadres' leading self-criticism and criticism of revisionism inspired the broad community members to do the same. The bitter and resentful female militia member Shi Fengjie, with a family of four, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism regarding individual weaving of mats during the study class. They said, "In the old society, it was because everyone did their own thing that we suffered cruel exploitation by the landlords, the more we worked, the poorer we became. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us onto the socialist collectivization path, uprooting poverty, and every household lived a good life. But now, we are always busy weaving mats for 'two yuan and two jiao,' neglecting collective production. Isn't this forgetting our roots? Isn't this being poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev? Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' savior. We will forever follow the socialist bright path indicated by Chairman Mao and will never engage in individual activities again." Thus, cadres led the masses, and the masses inspired the cadres. They studied one of Chairman Mao's quotations and used it to criticize one of the Chinese Khrushchev's black viewpoints, engaging in self-criticism once. Broad cadres and community members expressed their determination: they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "only socialism can save China," resolutely block the capitalist path of individual activities, and forever follow Chairman Mao's socialist bright path.

Through this campaign of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, broad cadres and community members not only voluntarily put the sideline production of weaving mats on the track of collectivization but also clarified that sideline activities are for accumulating funds for agricultural production, and the main effort should be placed on improving agricultural production. Community members universally established the idea of farming for the revolution. They said: in the past, it was "thinking of wife and children, focusing on the small stove," but now it is "thinking of the country, focusing on the world." The second team's cart driver Jing Zhenyu, who used to be afraid of delaying his individual weaving of mats, several times wanted to quit his job. After engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, he said, "Picking up the whip makes me happy, wholeheartedly for the revolution."

In the current spring plowing production, the entire brigade is deeply carrying out the activity to learn from Dazhai. According to this year's production increase measures, the entire team has forty mu of land with insufficient manure. Should they rely on heaven, rely on higher authorities, or rely on self-reliance? After the community members' discussion, everyone decided: except for arranging a part of the old and weak labor force to weave mats for the collective, other community members would actively participate in work, excavate manure sources, and finally met the requirement of applying manure to every mu of land. Currently, this brigade's spring sowing seeds have been fully prepared, agricultural tools have been repaired, and spring irrigation of land plots is being urgently carried out.

　　狠抓两条道路斗争　解决主要矛盾
    东风大队毛泽东思想学习班，围绕集体生产和副业单干的问题，进行斗私批修，进一步促进干部和社员的思想革命化，使集体经济更加巩固
    编者按：伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“抓革命，促生产”。东风大队办的学习班，由于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧抓住两条道路斗争这个纲，大大提高了干部和社员的阶级觉悟，解决了长期没有解决的副业单干问题。并且，由于这个问题解决了，其他一些问题如干部团结问题，干群关系问题，都及时得到解决。人们的精神面貌大为改观，备耕工作也搞得热气腾腾。
    有些同志没有正确认识革命统帅生产的关系，常常把革命和生产互相对立起来，这是不对的。东风大队的经验说明：抓革命，一定要抓住影响最大的问题，一定要抓住具有普遍性的问题，一定要抓住工作中的主要矛盾，帮助干部和群众把这些问题提到两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。在政治思想上打一个胜仗，这样就能一通百通。主要问题解决了，其他问题也就迎刃而解了。
    本报讯　农村办毛泽东思想学习班怎样才能收到立竿见影的效果？辽宁黑山县罗屯公社东风大队的经验是：办学习班一定要有明确的目的性，以“斗私，批修”为纲，集中解决当地的主要矛盾，带动其它问题的解决。这个大队在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠狠抓住编席子单干这个在两条道路斗争中长期没有解决的问题，促进干部和社员在灵魂深处爆发革命，进一步实现人的思想革命化，既解决了编席子单干问题，又顺利地解决了其它问题。
    人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队来到这个大队时，这里正在开展忆苦思甜活动。通过忆苦思甜，社员们增强了对毛主席的热爱，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的憎恨。当时在贫下中农给干部写的大字报里，有一张《要把东风大队引向哪条道路上去？》的大字报，问题提得很尖锐，立刻引起了宣传队的重视。
    宣传队经过认真调查，了解到东风大队的两条道路斗争十分尖锐复杂。这个大队的贫下中农，热爱毛主席的感情是深厚的，是坚决跟着毛主席走社会主义道路的。其中有不少的人，为了坚持走社会主义道路，一直同资本主义自发势力作斗争。但是，由于长期受中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”“四大自由”的毒害，社员编席子单干成风，很少关心集体生产。对这种现象，有的干部就采取硬卡和消极限制的办法。因为思想问题没有解决，单干风始终没有刹住，严重影响着干部与干部、干部与群众之间的团结，影响大队集体经济的巩固。一个老贫农愤慨地说：“编席子单干，是横在社会主义大道上的绊脚石。”
    宣传队根据毛主席关于“抓住阶级斗争这个纲，抓住社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这个纲”的教导，和大队领导成员作了研究，认为：以前办学习班效果不大，主要是没有抓住根本，没有抓住主要矛盾，只是“动了须子没动根”。
    怎样在学习班里抓根本？宣传队同志同群众商量以后确定：大队学习班、小队学习班、民兵学习班、家庭学习班都从编席子单干这个问题入手，引导干部、社员斗私批修，在灵魂深处爆发革命。这样，才能做到站在高处，斗在大处，挖在深处，改在实处。
    学习内容确定之后，宣传队首先帮助干部解决思想问题。他们组织大队、生产队干部认真学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示和“老三篇”，提高了干部的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。一直反对编席子单干的民兵连长、大队领导班子组长王金培，在学习班上带头斗私。他说：“以前，虽说我制止了自己家里编席子单干，并对群众做了一些思想政治工作，但是因为碰到了一些困难，就回避斗争、任其自流发展。这实际上就是给中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义开绿灯。”领导班子成员孟庆德说：“我在制止编席子单干这个问题上，私心也是很重的。自己知道编席子单干势必影响农业生产，几次想解决，但是因为来自家庭、亲属、部分群众中的阻力很大，我怕得罪人，后来慢慢的也就不管了。这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘三自一包’‘四大自由’的毒。我一定带头改。”在他们的带动下，其他干部也都分别在学习班上狠斗私心，深挖修正主义的毒根，表示决心带领社员坚决跟着毛主席走社会主义道路。
    干部带头斗私批修，带动了广大社员斗私批修。苦大仇深的女民兵史凤洁，全家有四口人，在学习班上个个就编席子单干问题斗了“私”，批了“修”。她们说：“在旧社会，就是因为各干各的，受地主残酷剥削，越干越穷。解放后，毛主席领导我们走上了社会主义集体化道路，挖掉了穷根，家家户户过上了好日子。可是，我们又整天围绕编一领席子‘两元二’打转转，不顾集体生产，这不是忘了本吗？这不是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害了吗？毛主席是我们贫下中农的救命恩人，我们要永远走毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道，再也不搞单干了。”就这样，干部带领群众，群众促干部，他们学习一条毛主席语录，就用来批中国赫鲁晓夫的一个黑观点，斗一次私心。广大干部、社员纷纷表示：一定牢记毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，坚决堵死单干这条资本主义道路，永远跟着毛主席走社会主义光明大道。
    通过这场斗私批修，广大干部和社员不仅自觉自愿地把编席子这项副业生产纳入集体化的轨道，而且明确了副业是为农业生产积累资金，要把主要的力量放在搞好农业生产上。社员们普遍树立了为革命种田的思想。他们说：过去是“胸怀老婆孩，放眼小锅台”，现在是“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”。二队车把式景振玉，过去总怕耽误个人编席子，几次想撂掉鞭子不干。自从斗私批修以后，他说：“拿起大鞭真高兴，全心全意为革命。”
    在当前春耕生产中，全大队正深入地开展学大寨的活动。按照今年增产措施，全队有四十垧地的粪肥还太少。是靠天，靠上级，还是自力更生？经过社员们讨论，大家决定：除一部分老弱劳力安排为集体编席子以外，其他社员都积极出勤，大挖粪源，终于做到了每垧地上满粪的要求。目前，这个大队春播种子已经准备齐全，农具进行了检修，地块春灌正在抓紧进行。
