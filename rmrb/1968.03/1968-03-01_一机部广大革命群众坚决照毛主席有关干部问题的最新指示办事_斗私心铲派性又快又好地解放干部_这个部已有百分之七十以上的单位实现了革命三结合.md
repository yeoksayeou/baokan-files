The revolutionary masses of the First Machinery Industry Department are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. They are swiftly and effectively liberating cadres by combating selfishness and eliminating factionalism. Over 70% of the units in this department have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, after achieving revolutionary unity, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of the First Machinery Industry Department, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed there, have swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. They have quickly and effectively liberated a large number of revolutionary leading cadres. Currently, over 70% of the units in this department have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations from the bottom up.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed there, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the First Machinery Industry Department held extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They launched a campaign to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. By December of last year, they had achieved revolutionary unity according to the administrative system and began the work of liberating cadres to quickly achieve revolutionary three-in-one combinations.

To swiftly and effectively liberate cadres and achieve revolutionary three-in-one combinations, the proletarian revolutionary factions of units such as the Automobile Bureau, Construction Bureau, and Bureau 8 of the First Machinery Industry Department, firmly grasped the key issue of correctly handling cadres. They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the highest standard for correctly handling cadres and engaged in an uncompromising struggle against factionalism and selfishness. They followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions step by step and fought against selfishness and factionalism without yielding an inch. A deputy director of Bureau 8 had many shortcomings and errors in the past, seriously alienating himself from the masses. In the early stages of the movement, he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and was therefore sidelined. After the task of liberating cadres was proposed, the cadre assistance group analyzed him historically and comprehensively, concluding that his main character and essence were good, and that he could be liberated as long as he had a good attitude towards examining his mistakes. However, his first examination did not satisfy the masses, and some people suggested holding more criticism meetings for him to apply pressure and touch his soul to solve the problem. At this time, some people proposed not to discuss his liberation for the time being and to sit down and study Chairman Mao's cadre policy again. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," everyone realized that in handling cadres, one should start from the desire for unity, not from personal indignation. Thus, the revolutionary masses of this bureau, following Chairman Mao's teachings, adopted methods such as individual heart-to-heart talks and small and medium-sized meetings to patiently help this deputy director correct his attitude and raise his awareness, deeply moving him. Three days later, he made a second examination, and the masses unanimously expressed satisfaction and trustingly elected him to participate in the bureau's revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership team.

The process of selecting the former political department director of the Automobile Bureau as the first-in-command of the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership team is a process in which the revolutionary masses of this bureau used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a standard, combated selfishness, eliminated factionalism, strengthened party spirit, and correctly handled cadres. This cadre had a rude attitude towards the masses in the past, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement, and had a strong antagonistic attitude towards the revolutionary masses for a long time. Therefore, the revolutionary masses had criticized and struggled against him many times. After this cadre was liberated recently, some revolutionary masses, especially the leaders of the mass organizations, still did not trust him and did not agree to his participation in the three-in-one combination leadership team. They thought: We have struggled against him in the past, and if he comes to power, he will definitely take revenge on us in the future. Later, with the help of the PLA comrades, they reviewed Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions such as "correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing revolutionary three-in-one combinations, consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. It must be resolved well," and used the method of two-point analysis to conduct a comprehensive analysis of this cadre. They realized that although this old cadre had serious shortcomings and errors, he had already gained awareness, and more importantly, he retained many revolutionary traditions. Such cadres are precious assets of the party. We should believe in him, support him, and let him stand up and participate in the ranks of revolutionary three-in-one combinations. After the leaders' thoughts were clarified, they went to do work among the masses. As a result, everyone not only agreed to elect him into the three-in-one combination leadership organization but also elected him as the first-in-command.

In the process of liberating cadres and achieving revolutionary three-in-one combinations, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of the First Machinery Industry Department, on the one hand, treated cadres as objects of revolution, helping them to recognize and examine their mistakes. On the other hand, they regarded them as a revolutionary force. They analyzed the current active thoughts of cadres and believed that the passive and wait-and-see attitude of cadres, which is relatively common, is an obstacle to the swift and effective liberation of cadres and the achievement of revolutionary three-in-one combinations. It is necessary to fully mobilize the initiative of the cadres themselves to accelerate the progress of cadre liberation work. Starting from the education of the situation, they helped cadres to realize that the current revolutionary situation in the country is excellent, and every revolutionary and would-be revolutionary cadre should not passively wait for liberation but should actively and consciously stand up to revolution and do new things for the people. Under the inspiration of the excellent situation, many cadres actively went to the units where they had the most criticisms to listen to the masses' criticisms.

    一机部广大革命群众坚决照毛主席有关干部问题的最新指示办事
    斗私心铲派性又快又好地解放干部
    这个部已有百分之七十以上的单位实现了革命三结合
    据新华社二十八日讯　第一机械工业部的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在实现革命大联合以后，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速落实毛主席有关干部问题的最新指示，又快又好地解放出了一大批革命领导干部。目前，这个部已有百分之七十以上的单位自下而上地实现了革命的三结合。
    一机部的无产阶级革命派和革命群众在驻部人民解放军帮助下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，去年十二月就按行政系统实现了革命大联合，并着手做解放干部，争取尽快实现革命三结合的工作。
    为了又快又好地解放干部，迅速实现革命三结合，一机部汽车局、基建局、八局等单位的无产阶级革命派，紧紧抓住正确对待干部这个关键问题，以毛主席的最新指示为正确对待干部的最高标尺，同派性和私心进行了不调和的斗争，做到紧跟毛主席最新指示寸步不离，狠斗私心、派性寸步不让。八局一个副局长，过去有不少缺点错误，严重脱离群众，运动初期又执行了资产阶级反动路线，因此，一直靠边站。解放干部的任务提出以后，帮助干部小组对他进行了分析，历史地全面地来看，认为他的大节、主流是好的，只要他检查错误的态度好，就可以解放。可是，他的第一次检查引起群众不满，有的认为要为他多开几次批判大会，给他点压力，才能触及他的灵魂，解决问题。这时有的群众提议，暂不讨论对他的解放问题，坐下来再学习学习毛主席的干部政策。经过反复学习毛主席关于“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的教导，大家认识到，对待干部要按照最高标尺，从团结的愿望出发，而不能从个人义愤出发。于是，这个局的革命群众，便按照毛主席的教导，采取个别谈心和开小会、中会的方法，耐心帮助这位副局长端正态度，提高认识，使他很受感动。三天之后，他又作出第二次检查，群众一致表示满意，并信任地推选他参加了局的革命三结合领导班子。
    汽车局原政治部主任被选为革命三结合领导班子第一把手的过程，是这个局的革命群众以毛主席最新指示为标尺，斗掉私心，铲除派性，增强党性，正确对待干部的过程。这个干部平时对群众态度粗暴，运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，而且较长时间内同革命群众对立情绪很大。因此，革命群众曾经批判斗争过他许多次。这个干部不久前被解放出来以后，部分革命群众特别是群众组织的头头，对他仍然很不信任，不同意他参加三结合领导班子。他们想：我们过去斗争过他，他若上台了，将来非对我们报复不可。后来，他们在解放军同志的帮助下，重温了毛主席“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”等一系列最新指示，用一分为二的方法，对这个干部进行了全面分析，认识到这个老干部虽然有严重的缺点和错误，但是他已经有了认识，更可贵的是在他身上保留着不少革命传统。这样的干部，是党的宝贵财富。我们应该相信他，支持他，让他站出来参加革命三结合的行列。头头们的思想通了，又去向群众做工作。结果，大家不仅赞同把他选进三结合的领导机构，而且选他当了第一把手。
    一机部无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在解放干部、实现革命三结合的过程中，一方面把干部作为革命的对象，大力帮助他们认识错误，检查错误，同时把他们看作是革命的动力。他们分析了干部目前的活思想，认为干部中比较普遍存在的等待群众去帮助自己、解放自己的消极被动思想，是影响又快又好地解放干部，实现革命三结合的一个阻力。必须充分调动干部本身的积极性，才能加速解放干部工作的进行。从形势教育着手，帮助干部认识到目前全国革命形势一片大好，每一个革命的和要革命的干部，都不能消极地等待解放，而应该主动自觉地起来革命，为人民立新功。很多干部在大好形势的鼓舞下，都主动地到对自己意见最多的单位去听取群众的批评。
