Vietnamese People's Forces Surround U.S. Troops at Xuan Loc, Ambush Enemy Convoy, Raid U.S. and Puppet Outposts, Shell Enemy Facilities
South Vietnamese Military and Civilians Strike Fear into the Enemy on the Broad Battlefield

New China News Agency, March 14th: Saigon News: Riding on the momentum of the recent New Year victories, the people of South Vietnam have been relentlessly pursuing and attacking the U.S. and puppet forces in various locations over the past few days. From the northern region of Xuan Loc to the southern Mekong Delta, the intense firepower of the South Vietnamese people has driven the enemy back in many areas, striking fear into their hearts.

In the Xuan Loc U.S. military base, which has been besieged by the people's liberation forces for nearly fifty days and nights, the liberation army has been frequently and fiercely shelling the U.S. troops holed up in the base while gradually tightening the encirclement, step by step pressing the enemy. On the 12th, the liberation army launched a ground assault around the Xuan Loc base, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Western news agencies admitted that more than 160 U.S. and puppet troops were killed or wounded. Under the powerful offensive of the liberation army, the thousands of U.S. troops holed up in Xuan Loc are terrified, "very tense," and fearing for their doom day and night.

On the 13th, the people's liberation forces also fiercely attacked the U.S. "American boys" in Yu Ling, Dong Ha, and Viet Mon south of the demilitarized zone, causing the enemy to suffer many losses.

In the central highlands north of Pleiku City, the people's liberation forces ambushed a U.S. military convoy on the 14th on the 14th Highway, which had long been cut off, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

In recent days, the people's liberation forces have also been very active in the areas around Saigon and the fertile Mekong Delta. They attacked a U.S. and puppet troop near the new Tan Son Nhat Airport not far from Saigon, continued to cut off and control the 4th Highway connecting the delta and Saigon, and launched a surprise attack on the Ben Luc market in the Mekong Delta, routing the puppet troops guarding the market. The people's liberation forces liberated a large area of this province. Western newspapers lamented, "This province is actually under the control of the Viet Cong (referring to the people's liberation forces)," and the U.S. and puppet troops are forced to "cower behind barbed wire," everywhere on the defensive.

The people's liberation forces also turned their cannons on many U.S. and puppet military facilities, launching fierce attacks. On the night of the 13th and the early morning of the 14th, the liberation forces' shells hit the important U.S. military airfields of Ban Me Thuot in the central highlands and the Rung Sat in Kien Giang Province. The U.S. military vehicle dispatching area in Ban Me Thuot was hit, and a raging fire burned. The command post of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade near Saigon, the U.S. military advisory group near My Tho, and the puppet police headquarters were also hit by the liberation army's accurate artillery fire. From the 12th to the 13th, the liberation forces also shelled the Bien Hoa U.S. air base and several puppet military outposts and strongholds around Saigon, killing and wounding a batch of U.S. and puppet troops.

　　围困溪山美军　伏击敌人车队　奇袭美伪据点　炮轰敌军设施
　　南越军民在广阔战场上杀得敌人闻风丧胆
    新华社十四日讯　西贡消息：乘新春大捷的东风继续穷追猛打的越南南方军民，几天来，在一系列地点，接连向美伪军展开了猛烈袭击。从北部的溪山到南部的湄公河三角洲，南越军民的密集炮火，在许多地区打得敌人节节败退，闻风丧胆。
    在被人民解放武装力量围困了近五十昼夜的溪山美军基地，解放军在频繁而猛烈地炮击困守在这个基地内的美军的同时，逐步紧缩包围圈，向敌人步步进逼。十二日，解放军又在溪山基地周围，发动地面进攻，重创敌人。西方通讯社承认，有一百六十多名美伪军被打死打伤。在解放军强大攻势下，龟缩在溪山的数千名美军心惊肉跳，“精神很紧张”，日夜担心他们的末日的来临。
    人民解放武装力量十三日还猛烈进攻非军事区以南的犹灵、东河和越门等地的美国少爷兵，使敌人遭到很多损失。
    在中部高原的波来古市以北地区，人民解放武装力量十四日在早已被切断的第十四号公路上，伏击一支美军车队，使敌军遭到重大伤亡。
    近日来，人民解放武装力量在西贡周围地区和富饶的湄公河三角洲，也很活跃。他们攻打离西贡新山一机场不远的地方的一支美伪军，继续切断和控制连贯三角洲和西贡的第四号公路，奇袭三角洲上的建和省美禄市场，把守卫市场的伪军打得狼狈不堪。人民解放武装力量解放了这个省的大片土地。西方报刊哀叹，“这个省实际上已掌握在越共（按指人民解放武装力量）的手中”，美伪军被迫 “蜷缩在铁丝网后面”，到处被动挨打。
    人民解放武装力量还把炮口对准了美伪军许多军事设施猛烈袭击。十三日晚和十四日凌晨，解放武装力量的炮弹击中了中部高原地区重要的邦美蜀美军机场和芹苴省荣诺机场。邦美蜀机场的美军汽车集中调度地区中弹，大火熊熊燃烧。靠近西贡的美军第一步兵师第二旅指挥部、美萩市附近的美国军事顾问团、伪警察局也挨了解放军神炮手的痛击。十二日到十三日，解放武装力量还炮击了边和美国空军基地以及西贡周围地区好几个伪军哨所和据点，杀伤了一批美伪军。
