The great helmsman steers the ship across the vast sea, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Zhang Chunyu, the "iron-boned soldier" of the Railway Corps, is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and infinitely believes in the great Mao Zedong Thought. He reads Chairman Mao's books every day and listens to every word of Chairman Mao. He volunteers to go to the most difficult places first; he saves comrades-in-arms without hesitation; he fights against injuries with a red heart and a hard bone; he hates class enemies the most; and he fights against selfishness and revisionism the fiercest. This is Zhang Chunyu and his comrades studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We are forever loyal to you! We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions to be your good soldiers. The representatives, with boundless love, belief, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are watching the gifts that comrades have presented to Chairman Mao.

The military training team of a certain unit of the Railway Corps stationed at Beijing Shijingshan Middle School, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, fully implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, adheres to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, and does in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the school. This is the comrades of the military training team organizing students to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution.

A certain company of the Railway Corps regards the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the lifelong combat mission of revolutionary soldiers. According to the characteristics of the station, they established a "Chairman Mao Quotations Station" to widely propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is the soldiers of the company propagating Mao Zedong Thought at the "Chairman Mao Quotations Station."

"We communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. Wherever we go, we must combine with the local people, take root, bloom, and bear fruit among the people." Following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, a certain company of the Railway Corps spreads Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go. They often study and apply the "Old Three Articles" together with the masses, and fight against selfishness and revisionism together. This is the comrades of the company having heart-to-heart talks with poor and lower-middle peasants.

"Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Following the teachings of Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin, a certain mechanical company of the Railway Corps actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, firmly defends Chairman Mao's military line, and resists the bourgeois military line promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, making the company advance rapidly on the road of revolutionization. This is the comrades of the mechanical company fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Following the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao, a certain unit of the Railway Corps, "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," overcame the "cold prohibition zone" of ice and snow, and completed the glorious task of building a large bridge ahead of schedule. This is the triumphant song of the great Mao Zedong Thought! The soldiers say, we will forever be loyal to the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and forever forge ahead on the path illuminated by the red sun!
