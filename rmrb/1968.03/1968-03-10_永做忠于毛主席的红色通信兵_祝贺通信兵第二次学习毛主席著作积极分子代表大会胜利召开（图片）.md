“To die for the people’s interests is heavier than Mount Tai.” The good soldier of Chairman Mao, Sergeant Wang Shuqing of the Communications Unit of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, strives to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought, and has made the solemn vow to “liberate the people, liberate myself, and dedicate my life to the people.” He regards the communication lines he maintains as a glorious battlefield for defending Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. To defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and to rescue comrades, he sacrificed his young life. This is Sergeant Wang Shuqing’s comrade-in-arms, Kang Liande, introducing Sergeant Wang Shuqing’s glorious deeds before his death to the representatives attending the conference.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers are forever loyal to you. The long-distance switchboard of a certain communications unit, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. To ensure the timely transmission of the orders from the proletarian headquarters, they worked diligently and made new contributions to the people. The picture shows the female soldiers working and studying at the long-distance switchboard.

With boundless loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao, and resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, there is boundless strength. A certain communications unit’s Twelfth Company, faithfully implements Chairman Mao’s military line, emphasizes proletarian politics, relies on Mao Zedong Thought to overcome all difficulties, conquer natural hazards, and has successfully completed many arduous construction tasks. This is their scene of studying Chairman Mao’s quotations before work.

The thorough implementation of Chairman Mao’s latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The picture shows the representatives attending the conference, with revolutionary enthusiasm, exchanging experiences in implementing Chairman Mao’s latest instructions.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the people’s army. A certain communications unit’s Fifth Company, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unshakably follows the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, greatly strengthening the ideological revolutionization of the company, and has been consecutively rated as a model company for seven years. The picture shows the Fifth Company doing propaganda and mobilization work during a political wilderness march.

“The method of sending military cadres to train revolutionary teachers and students is very good.” The military training team of a certain communications unit stationed at Xiangchang Road Primary School in Beijing, actively spreads Mao Zedong Thought, closely follows Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, enthusiastically helps revolutionary teachers and students carry out the educational revolution, and has established the Red Little Soldiers organization. The picture shows the military training team comrades studying Chairman Mao’s latest instructions with the Red Little Soldiers.

“You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!” The revolutionary faction of the proletariat in the communications unit headquarters, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, firmly stands on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, vigorously grasps the revolution, and vigorously promotes preparedness for war, making new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The picture shows them using revolutionary big-character posters to thoroughly criticize the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev.
