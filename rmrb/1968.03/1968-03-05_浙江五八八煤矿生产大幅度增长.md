The revolutionary workers of Zhejiang Province's 588 Coal Mine, with the assistance of the leftist support troops stationed at the mine, have organized extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They have launched a campaign to suppress bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies. On this basis, they have established strict labor discipline. They resolutely implement the principle of "revolution above ground and production below ground," and adhere to the eight-hour workday. The entire mine is ablaze with revolutionary fervor and production is booming. Building on the early completion of last year's coal production plan, coal output in January this year has seen a significant increase compared to the same period last year.

    浙江五八八煤矿生产大幅度增长
    浙江省五八八煤矿广大革命职工，在驻矿支左部队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，在自觉的基础上建立了严格的劳动纪律。他们坚决执行“上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产”的原则，坚持八小时工作制。全矿革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。在提前完成去年煤炭生产计划的基础上，今年一月份煤炭产量又比去年同期有大幅度增长。
