It was already past two in the morning, and all the soldiers in the company were asleep. Liu, the company commander, was still considering the plan for the next phase of cost-saving construction. Suddenly, the sentry, Xiao Chen, ran over to report, "The production team is on fire." Liu immediately thought of the great teacher Chairman Mao's instructions: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and we work thoroughly for the people's interests." He and the political instructor immediately decided to fight the fire. They mobilized the troops while reporting to the leadership.

Before setting out, the company commander led everyone to recite Chairman Mao's instructions: "Our responsibility is to the people." The great commander Chairman Mao's orders inspired the fighting spirit of the entire company. Everyone was spirited, and each person was full of fighting spirit, rushing down the mountain straight to the fire scene.

At this time, the flames were raging, and the water in the village had been used up. The villagers were anxiously waiting for the arrival of the firefighters. From afar, they saw a group of people running towards the village, and the villagers were overjoyed. A villager shouted, "The firefighters have arrived!" But it was not the firefighters who had arrived; it was the people sent by Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army.

After the troops entered the village, under the command of the company officers, the entire company immediately engaged in intense battle. Communist Party member and outstanding soldier Xu Maosen rushed towards the blazing fire, using a fire hook to fiercely beat and extinguish the burning straw pile. The fire hook caught fire, and he was afraid that the remaining sparks would spread to the new straw pile, so he simply threw away the fire hook and used his hands to beat down the fire. The flames grew more intense, his hands were burned, his clothes caught fire, and the thick smoke made him dizzy. But under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, he did not leave the fire line and fought the fire for over eighty minutes. Wu Xianying, an outstanding soldier who had a high fever all day, was scorched by the flames and fainted to the ground. When he heard his comrades shouting, "Resolutely, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," he immediately gained boundless strength, got up, and returned to the battle. The soldiers of the first platoon, who were responsible for water supply, ran back and forth on a three-mile-long winding path in the dark night, carrying water buckets. Some comrades fell and were injured but did not stop to rest. They had only one wish for the people's interests: to quickly deliver the water and ensure an uninterrupted water supply.

In this way, under the command of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, the entire company of soldiers "carried forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," and the great fire was finally extinguished. The village was saved, and the grain was rescued. At dawn, everyone cleaned up the scene, greeted the rising sun in the east, sang "The East Is Red," bid farewell to the villagers, and left the village. This company, which had been rated as outstanding for four consecutive years, began a new day of battle in the resounding song.

    为人民利益不怕牺牲
    已经深夜两点多了，全连的战士都睡熟了，刘连长还在考虑着下一步节约施工的计划。忽然，哨兵小陈跑来报告：“生产队起火了。”刘连长马上想到伟大导师毛主席的教导：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”他和指导员立即下定了救火的决心。他们一面集合部队，一面向领导报告。
    出发前，连长带领大家背诵毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”伟大统帅毛主席的命令，鼓舞了全连同志的斗志。人人精神振奋，个个斗志昂扬，直扑山下，奔向火场。
    这时，烈火正在燃烧，村上的水已经用尽，社员们焦急地盼望着消防队的来临。远远地看到一队人向着村子奔跑过来，老乡们喜出望外，一个社员高声喊起来：“消防队来了！”但是，来的不是消防队，是毛主席派来的亲人解放军。
    部队进村后，在连干部的指挥下，全连立即投入了紧张的战斗。共产党员、五好战士许茂森迎着熊熊烈火，用火杈猛打猛扑燃烧着的麦秸垛。火杈烧着了，他怕留下的火星蔓延到新的麦秸垛，就索性扔掉火杈，用双手扑打。火势越来越猛，手烧伤了，衣服燃着了，加上浓烟熏烤，许茂森一阵阵头晕。但是，在毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的光辉思想指引下，他一直不下火线，坚持与大火搏斗了八十多分钟。发了一天高烧的五好战士武宪英，被烈火烤得晕倒在地上，当他听到同志们高喊“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的声音，立即增添了无穷力量，爬起来，又投入了战斗。担任输水的一排战士，在黑夜里，在三里多长的羊肠小道上，挑着水桶来回奔跑，有的同志摔伤了，也不下来休息。他们为了人民的利益，只有一个心愿，就是把水赶快送上去，保证用水不间断。
    就这样，全连战士在光辉的毛泽东思想的指挥下，“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，一场大火终于被扑灭了，村庄保住了，粮食得救了。清晨，大伙整理好了现场，迎着东方升起的朝阳，高唱着《东方红》，告别了乡亲，离开了村庄。这个连续七年被评为四好的英雄连队，在嘹亮的歌声中，又开始了新的一天的战斗。
