Revolutionary women from all countries love the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! March forward to victory under the guidance of Chairman Mao!

Let workers see Chairman Mao's portrait.

A female student from the University of Tirana in Albania received a colored portrait of Chairman Mao. She was overjoyed and gazed at Chairman Mao's benevolent smile again and again. She thought she should take the portrait of Chairman Mao home to let her whole family see it every day. So, she asked a fellow villager to bring the portrait back to her hometown—a city far from Tirana.

The female student specially made a long-distance call to her father, asking him to go to the train station to pick up the portrait of Chairman Mao.

The news that her family had received the portrait of Chairman Mao quickly spread to several workers in the factory where her father worked. They all wanted the portrait of Chairman Mao, each giving the same reason: "We love Chairman Mao!" After a long discussion, they agreed to hang the portrait in the factory so that all the workers could see it.

Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's people.

Heroic Vietnamese women fighting on the anti-American front deeply respect Chairman Mao and have profound proletarian revolutionary feelings for him.

Many Vietnamese mothers teach their children to love Chairman Mao. Some Vietnamese children, as soon as they learn to speak, shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Once, a Vietnamese child, only five or six years old, seriously told the Chinese uncles: "Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's people!"

A mother of a Vietnamese People's Army soldier told the Chinese comrades: "The greatest help the Chinese people have given to the Vietnamese people is Mao Zedong Thought."

Chairman Mao's teachings inspire us greatly.

Japanese revolutionary women deeply respect Chairman Mao and firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought. They praise Chairman Mao as the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people and are determined to advance along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

A young Japanese female worker often diligently studies Chairman Mao's quotations and conducts revolutionary activities in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. After repeatedly studying this passage from Chairman Mao: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for the revolution," she exposed the ugly faces of those who shout "Sino-Japanese friendship" but are actually rabidly anti-Chinese and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship. She resolutely stood on the side of the broad masses of Japanese revolutionary people who truly uphold Sino-Japanese friendship and fought against the enemy. Chairman Mao's great teachings continuously inspire her, so she loves Chairman Mao deeply.

She made this battle vow: "Chairman Mao! No matter what difficulties and dangers I encounter, I will definitely fight to the end for the victory of the Japanese people's revolution!"

Thank Chairman Mao for sending female overseas aid workers.

A large number of Yemeni women have left their homes to work in a textile factory built with Chinese aid in Yemen. They say: "We are the first generation of female workers in Yemen." They deeply love Chairman Mao and are very grateful to Chairman Mao for sending female overseas aid workers to help Yemeni women appear for the first time on industrial labor posts. A Yemeni female worker wrote in a poem expressing her gratitude and praise to the great leader Chairman Mao:

	We love New China,
	We love Chairman Mao,
	Long live Chairman Mao!
	You sent female cadres,
	Helping Yemeni women liberate themselves from the home,
	Join the labor army.

At the completion ceremony of this textile factory, many female workers, together with male workers, entered the venue in high spirits, wearing shining gold Mao badges on their chests and holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," expressing their boundless respect for Chairman Mao and celebrating the birth of the factory.

Long live Chairman Mao!

At a film screening hosted by Chinese comrades, a young Moroccan woman was deeply moved every time the screen showed the lively scene of the great leader Chairman Mao with the Chinese Red Guards. She repeatedly held the hand of a Chinese female comrade, expressing her love for Chairman Mao and the Chinese Red Guards. She also raised high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted with the Red Guards in the film: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Follow Chairman Mao's words and engage in revolutionary struggle.

A Colombian female student studying in an Eastern European country excitedly told a Chinese female student: "The film of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards is excellent. I have watched it six times, but it's still not enough. Each time I watch it, I am greatly inspired." Then, she talked about her feelings: "You have Chairman Mao, so you can overcome any difficulties and march forward bravely." Saying this, she tightly held the hand of the Chinese student and said excitedly: "I will definitely be like the Chinese Red Guards, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and engage in revolutionary struggle!"

Always be with the great leader Chairman Mao.

A Chinese comrade working in Cuba went to a hospital in Havana for treatment. In the hospital, a Cuban female nurse looked at the shining Mao badge on the chest of the Chinese comrade with reverence. After a while, she enthusiastically said to the Chinese comrade: "It is Chairman Mao, the great Chairman Mao! Comrade, can you give me this Mao badge?" The Chinese comrade immediately gave the beloved Mao badge to this Cuban female youth who loves Chairman Mao. She was very happy and said: "I will wear the Mao badge on my chest and I will always, always be with the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Follow Chairman Mao's teachings and do the revolution well.

Several Chinese comrades studying in Denmark, when preparing to leave Denmark and return to China, visited a Danish old worker's family. As soon as they entered the door, they found that the whole family of the old worker was seriously studying the works of Chairman Mao. The old worker sighed to the Chinese comrades: "You live in China, with Mao Zedong, how happy you are!" His wife and daughter both expressed to the Chinese comrades that revolutionary Danish women deeply respect and love Chairman Mao.

When saying goodbye, the old worker's wife earnestly advised the Chinese comrades: "After you return to China, you must listen to Chairman Mao's teachings, you must do the revolution well, and never let China have revisionism! This is our most sincere hope for you!"

Long live Chairman Mao!

One day, Chinese comrades in Czechoslovakia suddenly received a phone call from a Czechoslovakian woman. The woman firmly said:

	"Comrades! The road of Mao Zedong is completely correct! I and my comrades firmly support you! Comrades, listen to Chairman Mao's words and persist in the struggle!"

After saying this, she hung up the phone.

Another time, an elderly Czechoslovakian woman said warmly over the phone: "Long live Chairman Mao!" (According to Xinhua News Agency, March 6)

    各国革命妇女无限热爱世界革命人民心中的红太阳
    敬祝伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆
    沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
    让工人们都看到毛主席像
    阿尔巴尼亚地拉那大学一位女学生，得到了一张彩色的毛主席画像。她万分高兴，一遍又一遍地端详着毛主席那慈祥的笑容。她想，应该把毛主席像带到自己的家里去，让全家人每天都能看到毛主席。于是，她托一位同乡把这张彩色像带回她的故乡——远离地拉那的另外一个城市。
    这位女学生专门给她父亲挂了一个长途电话，要他专程到火车站接毛主席像。
    这位女学生的家里得到毛主席像的喜讯，很快就被她父亲工作的那个工厂的几个工人知道了。他们都争着要毛主席像，理由都是一个：我们热爱毛主席！大家相持很久以后达成协议——把画像挂到了工厂里，让工人们都看到毛主席像。
    毛主席是世界人民的伟大领袖
    战斗在反美前线的英雄的越南妇女无限敬爱毛主席，对毛主席怀着非常深厚的无产阶级革命感情。
    许多越南母亲教育自己的子女要热爱毛主席。有的越南儿童刚刚学会说话就会喊：“毛主席万岁！”一次，一个只有五、六岁的越南儿童，非常认真地对中国叔叔们说：“毛主席是世界人民的领袖！”
    一位越南人民军战士的母亲对中国同志说：“中国人民给越南人民最大的援助是毛泽东思想。”
  毛主席的教导给我们巨大鼓舞
    日本革命妇女，无限崇敬毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。她们称颂毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，她们决心沿着毛主席指引的革命方向前进。
    一位日本青年女工，经常勤奋地学习毛主席语录，遵循毛主席教导进行革命活动。由于她反复学习了毛主席的这一段语录：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”她识破了那些口头上叫嚷“日中友好”实则是疯狂反华、破坏日中友好的反动家伙的丑恶面目，毅然地站在真正坚持日中友好的广大日本革命群众一边，同敌人展开了斗争。毛主席的伟大教导不断给她以巨大鼓舞，因此，她对毛主席无比爱戴。
    她立下了这样的战斗誓言：毛主席啊！我不管遇到什么艰难危险，也一定为日本人民的革命胜利而斗争到底！
    感谢毛主席派来女援外人员
    大批也门妇女走出家庭，在中国援助也门兴建的一个纺织厂里工作。她们说：“我们是也门第一代女工。”她们非常热爱毛主席，非常感谢毛主席派来了女援外人员，帮助也门妇女第一次出现在工业劳动岗位上。有一位也门女工在感激和赞扬伟大领袖毛主席的诗中写道：
    我们热爱新中国，
    我们热爱毛主席，
    万岁，毛主席！
    您派来了女干部，
    帮助也门妇女从家庭解放，
    参加劳动大军。
    在这个纺织厂落成典礼大会上，不少女工同男工人一起，怀着对毛主席无限敬爱的心情，胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手中拿着红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》，喜气洋洋地整队进入会场，庆贺工厂的诞生。
      毛主席万岁！
    一位摩洛哥女青年，在中国同志举行的一次电影招待会上，每当银幕上出现伟大领袖毛主席和中国红卫兵小将在一起的生动场面时，就非常激动。她一次又一次地紧握着中国女同志的手，表示她对毛主席和中国红卫兵小将的热爱。她还高高举起《毛主席语录》，同电影中的红卫兵小将一起同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    听毛主席的话进行革命斗争
    一位在东欧国家学习的哥伦比亚女学生，激动地告诉中国女同学说：“毛主席接见红卫兵这部影片太好了，我已经看了六遍，但是还看不够。每看一次，就受到极大的鼓舞。”接着，她谈到自己的感受：“你们有毛主席，你们什么困难都能克服，你们就能勇往直前。”说着，她紧握着中国同学的手，激动地说：“我一定要象中国红卫兵一样，永远听毛主席的话，去进行革命斗争！”
    永远和伟大领袖毛主席在一起
    一位在古巴工作的中国同志去哈瓦那一家医院看病。在医院里，一位古巴女护士以敬仰的眼光凝视着这位中国同志胸前佩戴的闪闪发光的毛主席像章。一会儿，她热情地对中国同志说：“是毛主席，伟大的毛主席啊！同志，你能把这枚毛主席像章送给我吗？”中国同志立刻把自己心爱的毛主席像章送给了这位热爱毛主席的古巴女青年。她十分高兴地说：“我要把毛主席像章挂在胸前，我一定永远永远和伟大的领袖毛主席在一起！”
    遵循毛主席的教导好好干革命
    在丹麦学习的几位中国同志在准备离开丹麦回国的时候，访问了一个丹麦老工人的家庭。一进门，他们就发现这个老工人的全家人正在认真地学习毛主席著作。老工人对中国同志感慨地说：“你们生活在中国，有毛泽东，太幸福了！”他的妻子和女儿都向中国同志表示，革命的丹麦妇女无限敬仰毛主席，无限热爱毛主席。
    告别时，老工人的妻子谆谆嘱咐中国同志说：“你们回到中国以后，一定要听毛主席的教导，一定要好好干革命，千万不要让中国出现修正主义！这就是我们对你们最衷心的希望！”
    祝毛主席万寿无疆
    一天，在捷克斯洛伐克的中国同志忽然接到一位捷克斯洛伐克妇女打来的电话。这位妇女坚定地说：
  “同志们！毛泽东的道路是完全正确的！我和我的同志们坚决支持你们！同志们，要听毛主席的话，坚持斗争！”说完，就挂了话机。
    又一次，一位捷克斯洛伐克老年妇女在电话中亲切地说：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”（据新华社六日讯）
