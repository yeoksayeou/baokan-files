The 8341 Unit's leftist personnel stationed in Beijing Knitting Factory, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have, after helping the proletarian revolutionary faction of the factory establish a revolutionary committee, actively and enthusiastically assisted the new leadership in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, walking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and advancing vigorously on the path of being highly proletarian and highly militant.

To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to hold power and use it well for the proletariat

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we need not only a correct line and policy, but also to cultivate and train tens of thousands of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." The 8341 Unit's leftist personnel believe that the revolutionization of the leadership cadre is a major issue concerning whether Mao Zedong Thought can be used to hold power and use it well, whether the masses can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and whether the brilliant achievements of the Cultural Revolution can be consolidated. They believe that the revolutionization of the leadership cadre should be based on the five conditions for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao and the three criteria for selecting cadres proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, and should be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On November 11, 1967, after the establishment of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee, the leftist personnel helped them establish the daily reading, morning report and evening summary, weekly democratic life meeting, and cadre participation in production labor systems. The leftist personnel and they together held struggle sessions to criticize and repudiate private and revisionist thoughts, checked their attitudes towards implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, took Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, and established the "loyalty" to the great teacher Chairman Mao; and they together studied the "Three Articles," establishing the thought of "completely and thoroughly serving the absolute majority of people in China and the world." The responsible person of the leftist personnel, Comrade Gu Yuanxing, often spoke to the cadres about Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, about how the great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to overcome powerful enemies at home and abroad and establish New China, about the story of the Long March, and about the shining deeds of Comrade Zhang Zide's "complete" and "thorough" service to the people.

The leftist personnel, based on the various active thoughts of the revolutionary committee members, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, carrying problems, criticizing and repudiating private and revisionist thoughts, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and accelerating the revolutionization of their thoughts. In the early days of the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some leaders of the original mass organizations were unwilling to cooperate with the leaders of the opposing faction, feeling "awkward sitting together with them." The leftist personnel then studied Mao Zedong's works with them, had individual talks with them, and through excavating private thoughts and criticizing factionalism, eliminated the estrangement between the two sides, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest." Soon after, new contradictions arose between the new and old cadres within the revolutionary committee: some new cadres held a distrustful attitude towards the old cadres of the originally opposing faction; some old cadres dared to criticize the leaders of the faction that originally supported them, but did not dare to boldly criticize the shortcomings and errors of the leaders of the other faction. In response to these problems, the leftist personnel helped them set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, both new and old cadres made profound self-criticisms, examined bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened unity. Through these activities, the members of the revolutionary committee clearly realized: the position is for serving the people, the power is the proletariat's power, and it must be used well for the proletariat.

Seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, walking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics

After the establishment of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee, it faced heavy tasks. How to handle the myriad of work? The 8341 Unit's leftist personnel helped the revolutionary committee to grasp the fundamentals and walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. They placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything. From top to bottom in the factory, they insisted on the unshakable system of studying Chairman Mao's works, regularly held reporting meetings, consulted Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and solve all problems with Mao Zedong Thought. The enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses soared to an unprecedented height, and they tackled difficulties with the spirit of moving mountains, solving many problems. As a result, the annual production plan was completed 22 days ahead of schedule.

Emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, first of all, is to implement Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Setting up study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The leftist personnel and the revolutionary committee acted promptly to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction. On the original basis, they set up more study classes. Part-time, semi-official, and full-time; the factory set them up, the workshops set them up, and they were set up in the dormitories. Study classes blossomed throughout the factory. Through setting up study classes, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was further overcome, the unity among the masses was strengthened, and the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution were consolidated and developed.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "the party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy, and should be a vigorous vanguard organization" was issued, the leftist personnel helped the revolutionary committee to set up party member Mao Zedong Thought study classes, greatly praised Chairman Mao's party-building thoughts and line, and strongly criticized the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines within the party. The cadres deeply felt: "No matter how many times you grasp, if you grasp the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, you grasp the fundamental fundamentals."

Insisting on the mass line, consulting with the masses on everything

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In all practical work of our party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses."

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, what kind of working organization should be set up? The committee members discussed and discussed, but could not come up with a satisfactory plan. The leftist personnel suggested that they go to the masses and mobilize the masses to propose plans. The masses quickly proposed a more reasonable new plan, reducing the number of personnel in the working organization by about two-thirds, embodying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and the spirit of the "Anshan Constitution."

Through the example of mobilizing the masses to propose plans, the committee members received their first lesson on insisting on the mass line, making them deeply realize that the masses are the true heroes, the masses are the wisest, the masses have the richest experience, and the masses are the most familiar with the situation. Only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's mass line can the consolidation of revolutionary power be guaranteed, and Chairman Mao's every latest instruction can be implemented the fastest and the most solidly. They took this issue as an important issue in the ideological construction of the revolutionary committee, proposing "three unchanging" requirements for themselves: the position has changed, but the feelings of the working class cannot change; the job has changed, but the nature of the working people cannot change; the work location has changed, but the style of connecting with the masses cannot change.

However, believing in the masses and relying on the masses is not about being a tail of the masses, but about using Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses.

In January, when discussing the arrangement of the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership cadre in the workshops, some masses disagreed with absorbing a sufficient number of revolutionary leading cadres, demanding that more revolutionary factions participate in the leadership cadre. In response to this problem, the leftist personnel and the revolutionary committee members studied Chairman Mao's teachings together: "All correct opinions of the masses, the party must, according to the situation, lead the masses and implement them; and for the incorrect opinions that arise among the masses, the party must educate the masses and correct them."

The committee members' awareness was raised, and they went down to do work, guiding the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly treating cadres, and propagating the great significance of letting revolutionary cadres play a core role in the leadership cadre. At the same time, they organized revolutionary leading cadres to go to the masses to solicit opinions and make self-examinations, gaining the understanding of the masses. As a result, the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership cadre in the workshops was quickly established.

Promoting the revolutionary and militant style advocated by Chairman Mao, forever preserving revolutionary youthfulness

In the process of assisting the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee in achieving revolutionary construction, the 8341 Unit's leftist personnel paid great attention to passing on the army's three-eight style to the revolutionary committee, making the revolutionary committee a leadership cadre that is vigorous, thrifty, and full of vitality.

The leftist personnel led by example to promote the style. In order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they sometimes did not eat, did not sleep, and did not rest on holidays and days off. They conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions without delay. From the exemplary actions of the leftist personnel, the members of the revolutionary committee deeply realized: promoting the three-eight style is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, as soon as they received Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they acted promptly and vigorously; they widely propagated, making them known to every household. They achieved quick action and quick implementation. Under the influence of the exemplary actions of the leftist personnel, the revolutionary committee paid great attention to establishing a thrifty and mass-connected style from the beginning. They did not seek luxury, strictly prohibited waste, and maintained close contact with the masses. The main leaders of the revolutionary committee did not have separate offices, and all committee members shared one office. They regulated not to treat guests, not to give gifts, and not to give speeches outside without the approval of the revolutionary committee, strictly preventing the tendency of seeking fame. The committee members were assigned to various workshops, regularly participated in production labor, and listened to the opinions of the masses. The masses called them the "backpack government" of the old Eighth Route Army era. They also went deep into the dormitories, delivering Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the workers' families, soliciting opinions, and inquiring about their well-being. Many workers were deeply moved, thanking them for bringing Chairman Mao's warm instructions and Chairman Mao's greatest care.

The revolutionary and militant style showed great power in the Beijing Knitting Factory, and the atmosphere of "unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness" was increasingly formed. Between the new and old cadres, between the cadres and the masses, and between the masses, everyone "cared for each other, loved each other, and helped each other," and the talking-heart activities became unprecedentedly widespread. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the whole factory presented a prosperous scene, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres were full of spirit, and the Cultural Revolution was rolling forward. The production situation was getting better and better. (Accompanying pictures)

　　用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅革命委员会
　　——八三四一部队支左人员协助北京针织总厂革命委员会狠抓革命化建设
    新华社十六日讯　《解放军报》记者、《北京日报》记者、新华社记者报道：无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员，在帮助针织总厂无产阶级革命派建立起革命委员会之后，积极热情地帮助新的领导班子活学活用毛泽东思想，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，使新的领导班子在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的大道上阔步前进。
    做无限忠于毛主席的红色接班人，为无产阶级掌好权用好权
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”八三四一部队支左人员认为，领导班子思想革命化，是关系到能不能用毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权的大问题，关系到能不能领导广大群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大问题，也是关系到无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果能不能巩固的大问题。他们认为，领导班子思想革命化，要以毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件和林副主席提出的选拔干部的三项标准为原则，做到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    去年十一月十一日，北京针织总厂革命委员会成立后，支左人员便协助他们建立了天天读、早请示晚汇报、每周民主生活会、干部参加生产劳动等项制度。支左人员和他们一起开斗私批修讲用会，检查对执行毛主席最新指示的态度，以林副主席为光辉榜样，树立对伟大导师毛主席的“忠”字；和他们一起学习“老三篇”，树立完全彻底“为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务”的思想。支左人员负责人古远兴同志，经常向干部们讲毛主席的伟大革命实践，讲伟大领袖毛主席领导中国人民战胜国内外强大敌人，建立新中国所走过的艰苦历程，讲红军长征的故事，讲张思德同志“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的光辉事迹。
    支左人员根据革委会成员的各种活思想，和他们一起带着问题学习毛主席最新指示，斗私批修，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，加速思想革命化。革命委员会建立初期，原群众组织负责人有的不愿和对立面一派的负责人合作，觉得“和他们坐在一块别扭”。支左人员便和他们一起学习毛主席著作，和他们个别谈心，通过挖私心，斗派性，消除了双方的隔阂，使毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的最新指示进一步得到落实。过了不久，革命委员会内新老干部之间的关系发生了新的矛盾：有的新干部对原来对立面一派的老干部抱着不信任的态度；有的老干部对原来支持自己的一派的头头敢于批评，而对另一派头头的缺点错误则不敢大胆批评。针对这些问题，支左人员帮助他们开办了毛泽东思想学习班。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，新老干部都作了深刻的自我批评，检查了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了团结。通过这些活动，使革委会成员明确地认识到：职，是为人民服务的职，权，是无产阶级的权，要为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。
    认真落实毛主席的最新指示，走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    北京针织总厂革命委员会成立以后，面临着繁重的任务。工作千头万绪怎么办？八三四一部队支左人员，帮助革命委员会狠抓根本，走突出无产阶级政治的道路。把活学活用毛泽东思想，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。全厂从上到下坚持学习毛主席著作雷打不动的制度，定期举行讲用会，遇事请教毛主席著作，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，用毛泽东思想解决一切问题。革命群众热情空前高涨，用愚公移山精神对待困难，许多问题迎刃而解。结果全年生产计划提前二十二天完成。
    突出毛泽东思想，首先就要落实毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示。毛主席指出：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”支左人员和革命委员会闻风而动，认真落实毛主席这一最新指示。在原来的基础上，办起了更多的学习班。业余的、半脱产的、脱产的；厂级办，车间办，宿舍里也办，学习班在全厂遍地开花。通过办学习班，进一步克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强了群众之间的团结，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    毛主席关于“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的最新指示下达后，支左人员就帮助革命委员会，开办了党员毛泽东思想学习班，大讲大颂毛主席的建党思想和建党路线，大力批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，提高了他们对党内两条路线斗争的觉悟。干部们深有感受地说：千抓万抓，抓住了对毛主席最新指示的落实，就是抓住了根本的根本。
    坚持走群众路线，遇事同群众商量
    毛主席教导我们：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”
    革命委员会成立之后，要组织一个什么样的办事机构？委员们讨论来讨论去，拿不出个满意的方案。支左人员建议他们到群众中去，发动群众提方案。群众很快就提出了一个比较合理的新方案，办事机构的人员比原来减少了三分之二左右，体现了毛主席的“五·七”指示和“鞍钢宪法”精神。
    通过发动群众提方案这个事例，给委员们上了坚持走群众路线的第一课。使他们更深刻地认识到，群众是真正的英雄，群众最聪明，群众的经验最丰富，群众对情况最熟悉。只有坚决贯彻毛主席的群众路线，才能保证革命政权的巩固，才能保证毛主席的每项最新指示落实得最迅速最扎实。他们把这个问题作为革命委员会的思想建设的重要问题来抓，对自己提出“三不变”的要求：地位变了，工人阶级的感情不能变；职务变了，劳动人民的本色不能变；工作地点变了，联系群众的作风不能变。
    但是，相信群众和依靠群众，决不是做群众的尾巴，而是要用毛泽东思想，用党的方针政策，去宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众。
    一月份，在讨论安排车间革命三结合领导班子时，有些群众不同意吸收足够数量的革命领导干部，要求让更多的革命派参加领导班子。针对这个问题，支左人员和革委会成员一起学习毛主席的教导：“凡属人民群众的正确的意见，党必须依据情况，领导群众，加以实现；而对于人民群众中发生的不正确的意见，则必须教育群众，加以改正。”
    委员们的认识提高了，纷纷下去做工作，引导群众学习毛主席有关正确地对待干部的教导，宣传让革命干部到领导班子里起核心作用的重大意义。同时又组织革命的领导干部到群众中征求意见和作检查，取得群众的谅解。结果，使车间的革命三结合领导班子很快地建立了起来。
    发扬毛主席提倡的革命化战斗化作风，永葆革命青春
    在协助北京针织总厂革命委员会实现革命化建设过程中，八三四一部队支左人员非常重视把部队的三八作风传给革命委员会，使革命委员会成为一个雷厉风行、艰苦朴素、朝气蓬勃的领导班子。
    支左人员言传身教带作风。为了贯彻毛主席的最新指示，有时饭不吃，觉不睡，节日和假日也不休息，他们传达毛主席的最新指示，从来不过夜。从支左人员的模范行动中，革命委员会的成员深刻地认识到：发扬三八作风，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。因此，他们一接到毛主席的最新指示，就闻风而动，雷厉风行；广泛宣传，家喻户晓。做到行动快，落实快。在支左人员模范行动的影响下，革委会从一开始就很注意树立艰苦朴素、联系群众的作风。他们不讲排场，严禁浪费，密切联系群众。革命委员会主要领导人没有单独的办公室，全体委员共用一间办公室。他们规定不请客，不送礼，不经革命委员会同意，委员个人不到外面作报告，严防风头主义。委员们分工到各车间，定期参加生产劳动，听取群众意见。群众管他们叫老八路时代的“背包政府”。他们还深入宿舍，向职工家属送毛主席最新指示，征求意见，问寒问暖。许多职工很受感动，感谢他们带来了毛主席的亲切教导，带来了毛主席的最大关怀。
    革命化战斗化作风在北京针织总厂显示出巨大威力，“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的风气日益形成。新老干部之间，干部和群众之间，群众和群众之间，大家“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”，谈心活动空前普遍。在革命委员会领导下，全厂出现一片欣欣向荣的景象，革命群众和革命干部精神焕发，热气腾腾，无产阶级文化大革命运动滚滚向前，生产形势越来越好。（附图片）
