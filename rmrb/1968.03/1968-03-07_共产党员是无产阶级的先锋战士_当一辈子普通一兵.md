	Communist Party Members Are the Vanguard of the Proletariat: Be a Lifelong Ordinary Soldier
	Zhang Benlin, a Five-Good Soldier and Mechanic from a Certain Unit

	We Communist Party members are the vanguard of the proletariat, dedicated to the public good and to the revolution. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev dares to say, "Joining the Communist Party can also mean becoming an official; this party membership is a reserve list for cadres." He attempts to corrupt Communist Party members with the poison of the bourgeoisie's desire for promotion and wealth. His intentions are truly malicious.

	In the old society, I was a destitute child begging for food. It was Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party of China that liberated my family from suffering. From the bottom of my heart, I love our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party of China. After enlisting, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I was consecutively named a Five-Good Soldier for several years and became a glorious Communist Party member. Due to work needs, my service period was extended multiple times. However, sometimes, seeing comrades who enlisted after me already promoted to cadres, I did have some selfish thoughts.

	I opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and found that Chairman Mao said, "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts dispelled the fog in my mind and pointed out the direction for my advancement. I thought, if it were not for Chairman Mao leading us, the working people, to make a revolution, and if it were not for the countless revolutionary martyrs shedding their blood and sacrificing their lives, how could we have our happy lives today? How could there be a Zhang Benlin? Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not here to become officials but to make the revolution. To defend the proletariat's ironclad fortress, I am willing to be an ordinary soldier for life. Thus, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, successfully completed all the tasks assigned by the Party, and advanced forward amidst the great waves of class struggle. Comrades say I have served for many years like one day, and I am a red soldier every year. I feel that my understanding of Mao Zedong Thought is still shallow, and in the future, I will continue to strive, study, and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

### 共产党员是无产阶级的先锋战士  当一辈子普通一兵

    共产党员是无产阶级的先锋战士  当一辈子普通一兵
    某部五好战士、修理工　张本林
    我们共产党员是无产阶级的先锋战士，一心为公，一心为革命。而中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“加入共产党，也可以做官，这个党员就是干部的后备名单”。他妄想用资产阶级升官发财的毒汁来腐蚀共产党员，用心真毒。
    在旧社会，我是一个逃荒要饭的苦孩子，是毛主席他老人家把我一家从苦海里解放出来。我从心坎里热爱伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的中国共产党。入伍后，在毛泽东思想哺育下，我连续几年被评为五好战士，成了光荣的共产党员。由于工作需要，一再延长超期服役时间。但是，有时看到比自己入伍晚的同志，已经提拔当了干部，也产生过一些私心杂念。
    我翻开《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。毛主席金光闪闪的伟大思想，拨开了我思想上的迷雾，指明了我前进的方向。我想，要不是毛主席领导我们劳动人民闹革命，要没有千千万万革命烈士流血牺牲，那有我们今天的幸福生活，也不会有我张本林。用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员、革命战士，不是为做官，而是为革命。为了保卫无产阶级的铁打江山，我愿意当一辈子普通一兵。我就这样，按照毛主席的指示，胜利地完成了党交给我的各项任务，在阶级斗争的大风浪中胜利向前。同志们说我是服役多年如一日，是年年红的老战士。我自己感到，我对毛泽东思想体会还不深，今后还要继续努力，活学活用毛主席著作，永远做毛主席的好战士。
