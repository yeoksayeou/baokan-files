Two weeks ago, a storm of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold swept through the financial centers of Western Europe. This storm has now developed into a fierce gale threatening the entire capitalist world's financial and monetary system. Under the fierce impact of this storm, the dollar, symbolizing the financial might of U.S. imperialism, is in grave danger, and the capitalist world's monetary system, which relies on the dollar as its backbone, is on the verge of complete collapse. This situation has thrown the Western financial world into chaos, and the U.S. ruling class is in an unprecedented dilemma of helplessness and desperation.

The new gold-buying frenzy that began at the end of February is the third since last November when the pound was devalued. It has lasted longer and been more frenzied than the previous two. What particularly unnerves the Western financial groups is that despite repeated official statements from the U.S. that it is determined to maintain the current dollar-gold exchange rate to uphold the dollar's status, and despite coercing some Western European countries to issue statements supporting the U.S. in dealing with the current gold-buying frenzy, the gold-buying frenzy in the Western European markets has only grown stronger.

Just after the U.S. and its Western European partners jointly issued a statement in Basel on March 10 supporting the official gold price, the gold-buying frenzy in Western Europe reached an unprecedented scale. On March 13, the trading volume on the London gold market reached an all-time high of 150 to 200 tons, with gold prices soaring to their highest level in seven years, forcing brokers to hurriedly suspend trading. In Paris, within an hour of the market opening, the gold trading volume broke the previous two gold-buying frenzies' records after the pound devaluation, exceeding the usual daily trading volume by more than twentyfold. The gold trading volume in Zurich was also twenty times the usual daily amount, and on March 14, the market demand for gold continued to expand, even showing a trend to exceed the previous day's level. Western news agencies described the frenzied gold-buying scenes in various Western European gold markets, noting that the markets were "in chaos," with crowds of buyers frantically dumping dollars and pounds to grab any gold, silver, and other precious metals they could get their hands on; some were dumping paper currency to hoard copper, cocoa, coffee, and other commodities; various sensational rumors spread rapidly in the markets, further unsettling people's minds and triggering wave after wave of buying frenzies.

These situations clearly indicate that the Western world has lost even the slightest confidence in the dollar and the monetary system represented by the dollar, becoming extremely anxious and paranoid. A Swiss banker anxiously admitted that the current frenzied gold-buying frenzy shows that "confidence in the dollar has undoubtedly been completely shattered."

The fundamental cause of this lack of confidence is the increasingly precarious position of the dollar. U.S. imperialism's limited financial and material resources cannot withstand the endless consumption of its global military aggression and economic expansion, leading to a continuous decrease in gold reserves and an increase in dollar debts; especially with the escalation of the Vietnam War, it has caused an unprecedentedly large fiscal deficit, worsening inflation, and a continuously increasing trade deficit, making the dollar crisis increasingly severe. Since the beginning of this year, under the heavy blows of the South Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism has attempted to further expand the war to reverse the deteriorating situation, which will further worsen the U.S.'s fiscal and international trade situation, greatly increasing Western financial circles' doubts about the future of the dollar.

Facing the increasingly dire situation, although the U.S. ruling class tries to maintain composure, it cannot hide its inner panic. U.S. financial tycoon and chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, David Rockefeller, admitted that "the prolonged gold-buying frenzy is worrying." U.S. Senator Jacob Javits sent a telegram to Johnson on March 13, urging him to immediately convene an "emergency session" of Congress to discuss the dollar's extremely dangerous current situation. Johnson himself on the same day exclaimed that "urgent and coordinated action" must be taken to "defend" the dollar; otherwise, the U.S. economy will face "serious" danger. However, U.S. financial tycoons and bourgeois newspapers helplessly admit that the U.S. currently has no effective countermeasures to quell the increasingly fierce gold-buying frenzy and save the dollar's shaky status.

According to U.S. bourgeois newspapers, the Western financial world generally believes that "some measures to change the U.S.'s current gold policy are being brewed." According to reports, the U.S.'s measures mean that the U.S. ruling class, seeing that the dollar's status is difficult to maintain, is plotting to shift the losses to other Western capitalist countries. However, doing so will inevitably lead to a major currency war in the Western world and will mean the complete bankruptcy of U.S. financial hegemony in the capitalist world. The London Times expressed concern in its March 14 commentary that the current gold-buying frenzy sweeping Western Europe "may be a precursor to a major upheaval."

　　西欧抛售美元英镑抢购黄金风潮越刮越猛
　　美国统治集团束手无策　美元地位摇摇欲坠
    据新华社十四日讯  两周前在西欧各金融中心掀起的抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的风潮，目前已经发展成为一场威胁整个资本主义世界金融货币体系的强烈风暴。在这场风暴的猛烈冲击下，作为美帝国主义金融实力象征的美元地位危在旦夕，而一向依靠美元作为支柱的资本主义世界货币制度也随时有彻底崩溃的危险。这种状况使西方金融界乱成一团，美国统治集团更是陷入了束手无策、一筹莫展的空前困境。
    二月底开始刮起的这场新的黄金抢风是自从去年十一月英镑贬值以来的第三次。它持续的时间之长以及抢购的疯狂性都大大超过了前两次。使西方金融集团感到特别不安的是，尽管美国官方再三再四地声明美国决心维持美元—黄金的现行比价，以维护美元的地位，并且胁迫一些西欧国家发表声明支持美国应付当前的黄金抢风，但是，西欧市场上的黄金抢风却越刮越猛。
    就在三月十日美国同它的西欧伙伴在巴塞尔共同发表支持黄金官价的声明之后，西欧的抢购黄金风潮反而达到了空前的规模。十三日这一天，伦敦黄金市场上的成交量达到了一百五十吨至二百吨的空前高峰，金价涨到了七年来的最高峰，市场上的经纪人不得不慌忙宣布暂停交易。在巴黎，当天开市后不过一小时，黄金的成交量就打破了英镑贬值后前两次抢风中的最高纪录，比通常每日交易量大二十几倍。苏黎世的黄金成交量也相当于平日的二十倍，而且十四日市场上的黄金需求继续扩大，甚至有超过前一天的趋势。西方通讯社在报道中描述西欧各黄金市场上疯狂抢购的情景时谈到，市场上“一片混乱”，整天都拥塞着抢购的人群，他们拚命地抛出美元、英镑，抢购一切能够到手的黄金、白银和其他贵重金属；有些人则抛出纸币，大量囤购铜、可可、咖啡等商品；各种各样耸人听闻的谣言在市场上迅速流传，更增加了人心的浮动，引起一阵又一阵的抢购浪潮。
    这些情况深刻地表明，西方世界对美元和以美元为代表的货币体系已经失去了起码的信心，提心吊胆，达到了草木皆兵的地步。瑞士的一个银行家不安地承认，迄今为止的疯狂抢风表明，“对美元的信任已经肯定无疑地完蛋了”。
    造成这种不信任的根本原因是美元地位的日益垂危。美帝国主义有限的财力物力经不起它在全世界实行军事侵略和经济扩张的无穷消耗，黄金储备日益减少，美元债务日益增多；特别是随着侵越战争的扩大，引起空前庞大的财政赤字、日益加剧的通货膨胀，国际收支逆差也不断增加，美元危机越来越深重。今年以来，在南越人民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义妄图进一步扩大战争来挽救败局，这将使美国的财政和国际收支状况进一步恶化，西方金融界对美元前途的疑虑因此大大增加。
    面对着日益危急的局势，美国统治集团虽然强作镇静，但却掩盖不住内心的恐慌。美国金融寡头、纽约大通银行行长洛克菲勒承认，“黄金抢风持续得如此长久令人担忧”。美国参议员杰维茨十三日打电报给约翰逊，要求他立即召开国会“紧急会议”来讨论美元当前极端危险的处境。约翰逊本人同一天也惊呼，必须迅速采取“紧迫而协调一致的行动”来“保卫”美元，否则美国经济将面临“严重”危险。但是，美国金融寡头和资产阶级报刊都无可奈何地承认，美国目前拿不出任何有效的对策来平息当前来势越来越猛烈的黄金抢风、保住美元摇摇欲坠的地位。
    据美国资产阶级报刊透露，西方金融界广泛认为，有关改变美国现行黄金政策的“某种措施正在酝酿中”。据报道，美国的措施意味着，美国统治集团眼看美元地位难保，正在策划以邻为壑，以便把损失转嫁给其它西方资本主义国家。但是这样做的结果，肯定会导致西方世界货币领域里的大混战，并且将意味着美国在资本主义世界金融霸权的彻底破产。伦敦《泰晤士报》在十四日的评论中表示担心，目前席卷西欧的黄金抢风“可能是一次大动乱的前驱”。
