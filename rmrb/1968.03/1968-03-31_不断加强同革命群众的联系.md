The editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *PLA Daily* titled "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" conveys the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, encouragement, and spur for our revolutionary committees! We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

The revolutionary committee is a great innovation by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. We deeply feel that this "three-in-one combination" power organ has tremendous vitality and unparalleled superiority. Just in terms of connecting with the masses, it is something that past power organs cannot compare with.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." The "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee, with the participation of revolutionary mass representatives, makes our proletarian dictatorship deeply rooted among the masses, maintaining close contact with the masses at all times, and having a broad mass base. This is of great significance for the revolutionary committee to prevent bureaucratism, prevent alienation from the masses, and to grasp the revolution and promote production.

The worker representatives in our factory's revolutionary committee are those who have emerged from the struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. They love our great leader Chairman Mao, and they are closely connected with the masses, being the confidants of the masses. Their participation in the revolutionary committee can timely reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, prompting the revolutionary committee and its members to continuously improve their work. For example, Comrade Shang Yongli, the director of our factory's revolutionary committee, had not gone to the third workshop for a relatively long time, and the masses had complaints. Comrade Mi Boshen, a committee member and worker representative, promptly conveyed the masses' opinions to him. Comrade Shang Yongli seriously considered the masses' opinions, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must not alienate themselves from the masses, must not stand above the masses, and must not act like officials and lords. Instead, they should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend in with the masses." The next day, he went to the third workshop to work and had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, helping them solve problems. The workers praised, "This is our good cadre!"

The worker representatives, due to their close connection with the masses, understand the production situation the best and have direct production struggle experience. Their participation in the revolutionary committee can make the revolutionary committee's leadership of production more practical. For example, when discussing the production plan for January and February this year, some comrades, following old frameworks, thought that the production time in January and February is short, and many people take leave to visit relatives, so the production plan should be set lower. However, Comrade Wang Mingchen, the deputy director of the revolutionary committee and a worker representative, knowing that the workers, after studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, are full of enthusiasm and have high morale, advocated not to lower the production plan. Later, the actual production result was that the plan was not lowered and was overfulfilled.

In the future, we must seriously carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, fully utilize the role of revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committees, and continuously strengthen our connection with the broad revolutionary masses. "As long as we do not alienate ourselves from the masses, we will definitely be victorious."

    不断加强同革命群众的联系
    北京市运输公司修理厂革命委员会
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论《革命委员会好》，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。这是毛主席对我们革命委员会的最大关怀、最大鼓舞和最大鞭策！我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    革命委员会，是我国亿万革命群众在毛泽东思想指引下实现的一个伟大创举。我们深深体会到，这种“三结合”的权力机构，具有强大的生命力，具有无比的优越性。单是联系群众这一点，就是过去的权力机构无法比拟的。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”“三结合”的革命委员会，有革命群众代表参加，使我们的无产阶级政权，深深地扎根于群众之中，经常同群众保持密切的联系，具有广泛的群众基础。这对革命委员会防止官僚主义，防止脱离群众，抓好革命、促进生产有非常重大的作用。
    我们厂革命委员会当中的革命工人代表，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中冲杀出来的。他们热爱伟大领袖毛主席，他们和群众息息相关，是群众的知心人。他们参加革命委员会，能够及时地反映群众的意见和要求，促使革命委员会及其成员不断地改进工作。例如，我厂革委会主任商永利同志，曾有较长的一段时间没有到三车间去，群众有意见。革委会委员、工人代表米伯先同志及时把群众的意见反映给他。商永利同志认真考虑了群众的意见，反复学习了毛主席的教导：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”第二天，他就到三车间参加劳动，和群众一起谈心，帮助群众解决问题。工人赞扬说：“这才是我们的好干部！”
    革命工人的代表由于密切联系群众，最了解生产的情况，有直接的生产斗争经验，他们参加到革委会中来，可以使革委会对生产的领导更加切合实际。例如，在讨论今年一、二月份生产计划的时候，有的同志按照老框框，认为一、二月份生产时间少，请探亲假的人多，应当把生产计划订低一些。可是，革委会副主任、工人代表王明臣同志，由于知道工人经过大学毛主席著作，干劲冲天，热情很高，主张不要降低生产计划。后来实际生产结果，计划没有降低，也超额完成了。
    今后，我们一定要认真贯彻执行毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，充分发挥革命委员会中革命群众代表的作用，不断地加强同广大革命群众的联系。“只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
