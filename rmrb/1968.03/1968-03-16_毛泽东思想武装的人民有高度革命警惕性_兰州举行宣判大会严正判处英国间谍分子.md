The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have high revolutionary alertness. Lanzhou holds a sentencing rally to sternly punish British spy.

George Watt sentenced to three years' imprisonment, Peter Dickart expelled from the country immediately.

The sentencing rally fully demonstrated the high alertness and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It fully demonstrated the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. This sentencing rally is a heavy blow to British imperialism and also a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

New China News Agency, Lanzhou, March 15. In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Intermediate People's Court of Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, held a sentencing rally today to "Hoist High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Sentence the British Spy George Watt." The court sentenced George Watt to three years' imprisonment.

At the same time, the Lanzhou Public Security Bureau announced that Peter Dickart, an engineer of the British "Vickers-Gimma Company" who has been engaged in espionage activities in our country, is to be immediately expelled from the territory of the People's Republic of China.

Today's sentencing rally fully demonstrated the high alertness and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It fully demonstrated the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. This sentencing rally is a heavy blow to British imperialism and also a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. The exposure of the British spy case is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The sentencing rally was held at the Anti-Revisionism Hall in Lanzhou City. Representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lanzhou attended the rally. The people angrily denounced the British imperialists for sending spies and strongly condemned the British spies for stealing our intelligence and sabotaging our socialist construction. The entire audience was indignant, shouting slogans: "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Severely punish the British spies!" "Resolutely smash the sabotage plots of the U.S.-Chiang, British, Soviet revisionist, and Japanese spies!"

After the rally began, all the revolutionary masses in the hall together wished our great leader Chairman Mao long, long life! They sang "The East Is Red" and read aloud Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways every day and every hour, trying to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable, beyond any doubt. We must never relax our vigilance."

In the midst of a storm of angry slogans, "Down with British imperialism!" "Severely punish the British spies!", the British spy George Watt, a major criminal, was brought into the hall. This major criminal stood on the dock, head bowed, pale, and trembling all over.

The representative of the Intermediate People's Court of Lanzhou City read out the sentence at the rally. The sentence listed the crimes of the spy George Watt, who, before coming to China, received the intelligence mission assigned by the head of the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," the British imperialist spy Jay, and, after coming to China, used the cover of an engineer to engage in espionage activities aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China and actively serving the aggressive policies of British imperialism. The sentence pointed out that the spy crimes committed by the criminal George Watt were irrefutable, and he admitted his guilt. He should have been severely punished, but considering that the criminal had shown signs of repentance, according to our country's policy of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist, it was decided to sentence George Watt to three years' imprisonment.

After the sentence was read out, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause. People raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely support the stern sentence of the Intermediate People's Court of Lanzhou City on the British spy George Watt!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Comrade Hu Jizong, deputy director of the Gansu Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the rally. He said that the Intermediate People's Court of Lanzhou City, in accordance with the unanimous demand of the broad revolutionary masses, sentenced the British spies. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, fully demonstrating the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship in our country.

Hu Jizong strongly condemned the British imperialists and U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionism for their various crimes of sabotage and disruption against our country. He pointed out that the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries fear the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship in our country and hate the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, stepping up their spy sabotage activities against our country. The recently exposed British spy case is an example. These spy sabotage activities are directly coordinated with the U.S. imperialists' aggression plots against our country.

He said that the exposure of the British spy case has given us a vivid lesson in class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not resign themselves to their defeat in China." "We must never relax our vigilance against the imperialists and their running dogs' frenzied plots of revenge because of our victory." The better the revolutionary situation, the more we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, never forget class struggle, and never forget the proletarian dictatorship.

Hu Jizong said that in the great struggle to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness for war, strengthen the concept of enemy situation, heighten revolutionary vigilance, thoroughly smash all sabotage plots of the domestic and foreign class enemies, and strive forward to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Following that, representatives of the Lanzhou region Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, Red Guards of higher education institutions, Red Guards of middle schools, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lanzhou spoke at the rally. They said:

"Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' Listen, U.S., British imperialists, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries: Our sky is the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, our land is the land of Mao Zedong Thought, and our people are the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how you sabotage and make trouble, you will inevitably meet the fate of final failure and perishment."

"We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be a hundred times more vigilant against the sabotage plots of the domestic and foreign class enemies, protect our great motherland, protect socialist construction, and protect the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

"We must unite and fight with the revolutionary people of the world, and carry on the great struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to the end!"

As the sentencing rally ended, the revolutionary masses raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely suppress all sabotage activities of the domestic and foreign class enemies!" "Strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship!"

Today's rally once again proved that the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries dare to stretch out their black hands to engage in spy activities against our country. No matter what disguise they wear or what cunning tricks they play, they will not escape the keen eyes and mighty fists of the Chinese people, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and maintain high revolutionary vigilance at all times.

　　毛泽东思想武装的人民有高度革命警惕性
　　兰州举行宣判大会严正判处英国间谍分子
　　依法判处乔治·瓦特有期徒刑三年，立即驱逐彼德·迪卡特出境
    宣判大会充分体现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的、正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民所具有的高度警惕性和革命精神，充分体现了我国无产阶级专政的强大威力。这次宣判大会，是对英帝国主义的一次沉重打击，也是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的一次沉重打击
    新华社兰州十五日电  在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，甘肃省兰州市中级人民法院十五日举行“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，判处英国间谍分子乔治·瓦特宣判大会”，依法判处乔治·瓦特有期徒刑三年。
    在此同时，兰州市公安局还宣布，把在我国从事间谍情报活动的英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”工程师彼德·迪卡特（西德人）立即驱逐出中华人民共和国国境。
    今天的宣判大会，充分体现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的、正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民所具有的高度警惕性和革命精神，充分体现了我国无产阶级专政的强大威力。这次宣判大会，是对英帝国主义的一次沉重打击，也是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的一次沉重打击。英国间谍案的破获，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    宣判大会在兰州市反修馆举行。兰州市无产阶级革命派、革命群众和中国人民解放军驻兰州部队的代表参加了大会。人们愤怒声讨英帝国主义派遣间谍，强烈谴责英帝间谍分子窃取我国情报，破坏我国社会主义建设的滔天罪行。全场群情激愤，高呼口号：“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“严厉惩处英国间谍分子！”“坚决粉碎美蒋、英帝、苏修、日本特务的阴谋破坏活动！”
    宣判大会开始后，全场革命群众共同敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！高唱《东方红》，齐声朗读毛主席的伟大教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    英帝国主义间谍分子乔治·瓦特，在一片“打倒英帝国主义！”“严惩英国间谍分子！”的愤怒口号声中，被押进会场。这个罪恶重大的英国间谍分子，低头站在被审判席上，面无血色，浑身发抖。
    兰州市中级人民法院代表在大会上宣读了判决书。判决书历数间谍分子乔治·瓦特来中国前接受英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”负责人、英帝国主义间谍分子杰伊布置的情报任务；来中国后以工程师身份为掩护，进行旨在反对中华人民共和国的间谍活动，积极为英帝国主义的侵略政策效劳的种种罪行。判决书指出，罪犯乔治·瓦特所犯间谍罪行，证据确凿，本人供认不讳，本应从严惩处，但考虑到该犯有悔罪表现，依据我国坦白从宽，抗拒从严的政策，决定从轻处刑，判处乔治·瓦特有期徒刑三年。
    宣读判决书以后，全场响起雷鸣般的掌声，人们振臂高呼：“坚决拥护兰州市中级人民法院对英国间谍分子乔治·瓦特的严正判决！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    甘肃省革命委员会副主任胡继宗同志在大会上讲话。他说，兰州市中级人民法院根据广大革命群众的一致要求，判处英国间谍分子，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，充分显示了我国无产阶级专政的强大威力。
    胡继宗强烈谴责英帝国主义和美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义，对我国进行破坏和捣乱的种种罪行。他指出，帝、修、反害怕我国无产阶级专政的巩固，仇恨我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，加紧对我国进行特务间谍破坏活动，最近破获的英国间谍案就是一例。这些间谍破坏活动，是和美帝国主义对我国的侵略阴谋直接相配合的。
    他说，英国间谍案的破获，给我们上了一堂生动的阶级斗争教育课。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。”“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。革命形势越好，我们越要提高革命警惕性，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。
    胡继宗说，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎国内外阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏活动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进。
    接着，兰州地区工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会和中国人民解放军驻兰州部队的代表，分别在会上讲了话。他们说：
    “毛主席教导我们：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’美、英帝国主义，苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派听着：我们的天，是毛泽东思想的天，我们的地，是毛泽东思想的地，我们的人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。不管你们怎样进行破坏和捣乱，绝对逃不脱最后失败和灭亡的命运。”
    “我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百倍警惕国内外一切阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫社会主义建设，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。”
    “我们要和世界上广大革命人民团结战斗在一起，把反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争进行到底！”
    宣判大会结束时，革命群众振臂高呼：“坚决镇压国内外阶级敌人的一切破坏活动！”“巩固和加强无产阶级专政！”
    今天的大会再一次证明：帝、修、反胆敢伸出黑手，对我国进行特务、间谍活动，不管他们披着什么伪装，玩弄什么狡猾手段，都逃不脱用毛泽东思想武装起来的、时刻保持高度革命警惕的中国人民的雪亮眼睛和强大巨掌。
