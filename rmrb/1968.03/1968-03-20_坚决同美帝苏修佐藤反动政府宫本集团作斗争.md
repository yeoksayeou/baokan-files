China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and Japan External Trade Organization Six Organizations' Talks Memorandum Signed in Beijing

Resolutely Struggle Against the U.S. Imperialists, Soviet Revisionists, the Sato Reactionary Government, and the Royalist Group

The Great Victory of China's Cultural Revolution Heavily Strikes the Imperialists, Revisionists, and Reactionaries

Both Sides Resolve to Struggle for Further Development of Friendship and Trade Relations Between the Peoples of China and Japan

New China News Agency, March 19th—The memorandum of talks between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japan External Trade Organization and its six affiliated organizations was signed in Beijing today. Both sides unanimously agreed that continuing to strengthen the struggle against the four enemies—U.S. imperialism, the Soviet modern revisionist clique, the Sato reactionary government, and the Royalist revisionist group—is not only in the interests of the Japanese and Chinese peoples but also in the interests of the peoples of Asia and the world.

The memorandum states that both sides seriously point out that only by waging a head-on struggle against these four enemies led by U.S. imperialism, exposing their various plots and sabotage activities, and removing the artificial obstacles they set up, can the friendly exchanges and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan develop smoothly.

The agreement between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japan Industrial Exhibition Survey Team on holding the 1969 Japan Industrial Exhibition in Beijing and Shanghai was also signed in Beijing today.

Zhang Huadong, vice-chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and ten others represented the Chinese side, while Hagiwara Teiji and ten others represented the Japanese side, signing the "Memorandum of Talks." Zhang Huadong and two others, and Sugimoto Tomozane and two others, respectively represented the Chinese and Japanese sides in signing the "Agreement."

Lin Haiyun, acting minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and other relevant officials attended the signing ceremony. Japanese friends in Beijing, such as Saionji Koiichi, and those on friendly visits to Beijing, such as Miyazaki Seiken, Shimada Masao, and Sukuda Eii, also attended the signing ceremony.

New China News Agency, March 19th—The full text of the memorandum of talks between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japan External Trade Organization and its six affiliated organizations is as follows:

At the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, representatives from the Japan External Trade Organization, Kansai Branch of the Japan External Trade Organization, Ishikawa Prefecture Branch of the Japan External Trade Organization, Kyoto Branch of the Japan External Trade Organization, Kobe Branch of the Japan External Trade Organization, and Tokai General Bureau of the Japan External Trade Organization, these friendly trade organizations, visited the People's Republic of China in the spring of 1968. They visited factories, people's communes, schools, and units of the People's Liberation Army, and had extensive contact with workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards.

The representatives from the Japanese friendly trade organizations were warmly received by Premier Zhou Enlai during their stay in Beijing.

The representatives of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade held warm and friendly talks with the representatives of the Japanese friendly trade organizations and reached a consensus on further developing the friendship and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan.

Both sides unanimously pointed out that the current world situation is excellent.

The Japanese side was very pleased to see with their own eyes that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, had achieved decisive victories in 1967. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Chinese people are now striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In cities and countryside across China, Mao Zedong Thought is more widely and deeply understood by the masses, becoming the source of strength for the revolutionary masses to march forward bravely. The broad masses of workers and peasants are actively responding to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," and industrial and agricultural production is thriving. The whole of China is full of vitality and confidence, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity. The Japanese side felt most deeply through this visit that the Chinese people have achieved extremely great successes in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The Japanese side pointed out that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, and has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

The Chinese side warmly praised the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle. In the past year, the Japanese people have waged wave after wave of powerful struggles against U.S. aggression, for national independence, in support of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S., to defend Sino-Japanese friendship, and against Sato's evil activities in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Vietnam. Recently, a new anti-U.S. storm has swept across the Japanese archipelago. The broad masses of the Japanese people have waged a magnificent and heroic struggle against the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" docking at Sasebo Port, against the construction of the Sanrizuka military airfield and the establishment of a new U.S. field hospital in Tokyo by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, for the return of Okinawa, for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and against the U.S. imperialists turning Japan into the largest base for invading Asia. Through these struggles, a broad anti-U.S. patriotic united front is forming and expanding. The Chinese side stated that the great struggle of the Japanese people is a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride on its head for long." "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capital and militarist warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." The Chinese side stated that the Chinese people, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the struggle of the Japanese people for independence, democracy, and peace, and firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the great Japanese people.

Both sides unanimously pointed out that the heroic people's war of resistance against the U.S. for national liberation in Vietnam is the greatest national liberation war in the world today. The brilliant achievements of the people of South Vietnam since the Tet Offensive have once again shown to the world that the Vietnamese people have completely grasped the initiative in the war, and the U.S. aggressor forces have been beaten to the point of having no way out and are gasping for breath. The great victory of the Vietnamese people has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, plunging the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys into serious turmoil and chaos. The flames of national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning more fiercely. The anti-U.S. struggle of the people of the world is getting better and better. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are increasingly heading towards a dead end. The capitalist world has fallen into an insoluble crisis, with the devaluation of the pound and the dollar crisis greatly exacerbating the contradictions among the imperialist countries. U.S. imperialism is already facing serious political, economic, and military crises. The overall situation, as Chairman Mao said, is that "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

Both sides unanimously agreed that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the peoples of China and Japan and the people of the world; the Soviet modern revisionist clique is the number one accomplice of the U.S.; the Sato reactionary government is speeding up the implementation of its pro-U.S., pro-Soviet, anti-China reactionary policies, striving to accelerate the process of fully reviving militarism, and has become a loyal lackey of U.S. aggression in Asia; the Royalist revisionist group has degenerated into a special forces unit of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries against the people and against China. Continuing to strengthen the struggle against these four enemies is not only in the interests of the Japanese and Chinese peoples but also in the interests of the peoples of Asia and the world.

The Japanese side introduced in the talks the situation of the Japanese friendly trade circles, together with the broad masses of the Japanese people, upholding national dignity, uniting against the enemy, and fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Chinese side expressed firm support for the struggle of the Japanese friendly trade circles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries; for the active efforts made by the friends of the Japanese friendly trade circles to develop the friendship and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan, the Chinese side expressed respect.

Both sides confirmed that the "Agreement on Promoting Friendly Trade Between the Peoples of China and Japan" signed in Beijing on February 27, 1967, is correct and has played a powerful role in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, which has been welcomed and supported by the peoples of both countries.

Both sides discussed in the talks the prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese friendly trade, unanimously expressing that in the future, they will carry forward the fighting spirit of the "Agreement," continue to adhere to the three political principles of Sino-Japanese relations, the three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics, and strive together for the further development of the friendship and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan.

Both sides seriously pointed out that in the development of friendly exchanges and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan, there are still serious obstacles, which come from U.S. imperialism, the Sato reactionary government, and its lackeys. Therefore, only by waging a head-on struggle against these four enemies led by U.S. imperialism, exposing their various plots and sabotage activities, and removing the artificial obstacles they set up, can the friendly exchanges and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan develop smoothly.

Both sides also discussed in the talks the strengthening of friendly exchanges, technological exchanges, and friendly trade business between the two sides, reached a consensus, and decided to make further efforts for this purpose.

Both sides also discussed and reached a satisfactory agreement on the issue of holding an industrial exhibition in China by Japan.

    新华社十九日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会六个组织会谈纪要，今天在北京签字。双方一致认为，继续加强同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义集团、佐藤反动政府和宫本修正主义集团这四个敌人的斗争，不仅符合日本人民和中国人民的利益，也符合亚洲人民和全世界人民的利益。

    中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本工业展览会调查团关于一九六九年日本在北京、上海举办工业展览会的协议书，今天也在北京同时签字。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会副主任张化东等十一人代表中国方面，日本国际贸易促进协会代表萩原定司等十一人代表日本方面，在《会谈纪要》上签字。中国国际贸易促进委员会副主任张化东等三人和日本工业展览会调查团代表杉本重藏等三人分别代表中国方面和日本方面在《协议书》上签字。
    对外贸易部代理部长林海云等有关方面负责人参加了签字仪式。在北京的日本朋友西园寺公一，正在北京进行友好访问的宫崎世民、岛田政雄、宿谷荣一等，也参加了签字仪式。
    新华社十九日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会六个组织的会谈纪要，全文如下：
    应中国国际贸易促进委员会邀请，日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部、日本国际贸易促进协会石川县支局、日本国际贸易促进协会京都支局、日本国际贸易促进协会神户支局、日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局等友好贸易团体的代表，于一九六八年春季在中华人民共和国进行了友好访问，参观了工厂、人民公社、学校、人民解放军部队，同工农兵群众和红卫兵进行了广泛的接触。
    日本友好贸易团体的代表在北京期间受到了周恩来总理亲切友好的接见。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会的代表同日本友好贸易团体的代表进行了热情友好的会谈，并就今后进一步发展中日两国人民的友好和贸易关系等问题取得了一致的意见。
    双方一致指出，当前世界形势一片大好。
    日本方面十分高兴地亲眼看到，由中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，已经在一九六七年取得了决定性的胜利。在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，目前中国人民正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。在中国的城乡，毛泽东思想更加普及和深入人心，成为亿万革命群众奋勇前进的力量源泉。广大工农群众积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，工农业生产正在蓬勃发展。整个中国充满朝气和信心，到处是一派欣欣向荣的景象。日本方面通过这次访问，感受最深的是，中国人民活学活用毛泽东思想获得了极其伟大的成就。日本方面指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，极大地鼓舞了全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    中国方面热烈赞扬日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。在过去一年里，日本人民为反对美帝侵略，争取民族独立，为支持越南人民抗美救国战争，保卫中日友好，反对佐藤到美国、台湾和南越等地进行罪恶活动，展开了一次又一次气势磅礴的斗争。最近，新的反美风暴又席卷了日本列岛。日本广大人民群众为反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”进驻佐世保港，为反对美日反动派修建三里塚军用机场和在东京新设美军野战医院，为收回冲绳，废除日美“安全条约”，反对美帝国主义变日本为侵略亚洲的最大基地，展开了波澜壮阔的英勇斗争。通过这些斗争，一个广泛的反美爱国统一战线正在形成和扩大。中国方面表示，日本人民的伟大斗争是对中国人民和世界人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。
    毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”中国方面表示，中国人民遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平的斗争，并且深信，最后的胜利一定属于伟大的日本人民。
    双方一致指出，英雄的越南人民的抗美救国的人民战争，是当前世界上最伟大的民族解放战争。越南南方人民新春攻势以来所取得的辉煌战果，再一次向全世界显示，越南人民已经完全掌握了战争的主动权，美国侵略军已经被打得走投无路，气息奄奄。越南人民的伟大胜利，大长了世界革命人民的志气，使美帝国主义及其走狗陷入严重的动荡和混乱之中。亚、非、拉人民的民族解放斗争的烈火越烧越旺。全世界人民反美斗争形势越来越好。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派越来越走上穷途末路。资本主义世界已陷入不可解脱的危机之中，英镑贬值和美元危机，大大加剧了帝国主义国家之间的矛盾。美帝国主义已经面临政治上、经济上、军事上的严重危机。整个形势正如毛主席所说：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    双方一致认为，美帝国主义是中日两国人民和全世界人民的头号敌人；苏联现代修正主义集团是美帝的头号帮凶；佐藤反动政府加紧推行亲美、联苏、反华的反动政策，极力加快全面复活军国主义的步子，充当了美帝侵略亚洲的忠实走卒；宫本修正主义集团已经堕落成为美日反动派反人民、反华的别动队。继续加强同这四个敌人的斗争，不仅符合日本人民和中国人民的利益，也符合亚洲人民和全世界人民的利益。
    日本方面在会谈中介绍了日本友好贸易界人士同广大日本人民一道，发扬民族气节，同仇敌忾，向美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的情况。中国方面对日本友好贸易界人士同美日反动派进行的斗争表示坚决支持；对日本友好贸易界的朋友们为发展中日两国人民的友好和贸易关系所作的积极努力，表示敬意。 
    双方确认，一九六七年二月二十七日在北京签订的《关于促进中日两国人民友好贸易议定书》是正确的，对发展中日友好和贸易起了有力的推动作用，受到了中日两国人民的欢迎和支持。
    双方在会谈中展望了中日友好贸易的发展前景，一致表示，今后要发扬《议定书》的战斗精神，继续坚持中日关系的政治三原则，贸易三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则，为进一步发展中日两国人民的友好和贸易关系而共同奋斗。
    双方严肃指出，在发展中日两国人民的友好往来和贸易关系的道路上，还存在着严重的障碍，这些障碍来自美帝国主义、佐藤反动政府及其帮凶，因此，同以美帝国主义为首的四个敌人展开针锋相对的斗争，揭露它们的种种阴谋和破坏活动，排除它们设置的人为障碍，中日两国人民的友好往来和贸易关系才能顺利发展。
    双方在会谈中还就加强彼此间的友好往来、技术交流和友好贸易业务等事宜进行了协商，取得了一致的意见，并决定为此作出进一步的努力。
    双方就日本在中国举办工业展览会问题，进行了协商，并达成了圆满的协议。
