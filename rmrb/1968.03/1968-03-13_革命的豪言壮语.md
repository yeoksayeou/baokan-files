Revolutionary Slogans

    * The three-foot cord in the hands of our telephone operators is a red line connecting the Party and the people. Through it, the supreme commander Chairman Mao directs countless troops; through it, the victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are reported; through it, Chairman Mao's warm care for the people is conveyed; through it, the boundless love of hundreds of millions of people for Chairman Mao is expressed.
              Deputy Squad Leader of a Certain Unit, Gao Yansheng

    * Ensuring the smooth command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters is our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Answering a phone call is our contribution to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
                      Long-Distance Operator of a Certain Unit

    * To ensure the smooth command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, we are willing to fight for a lifetime in the wilderness, to be line maintenance soldiers for a lifetime.
                        Maintenance Post of a Certain Unit

    * The space in the machine room is limited, but the responsibility to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is boundless.
              Switchboard Operator of a Certain Unit, Xie Jinying

    * To eliminate line faults, we must first eliminate ideological faults.
                Squad Leader of a Certain Unit, Wei Shichun

    * Towards the bourgeois private interests deep in the soul, we must adopt the method of "killing" just like dealing with rats in the granary. If we only block without killing, it will "dig holes" everywhere, harming the revolution.
              Quartermaster of a Certain Unit, Zhang Guicheng

　　革命的豪言壮语
    ＊我们电话员手里的三尺塞绳，是联系党和人民的一条红线。通过它，最高统帅毛主席指挥千军万马；通过它，传来毛主席革命路线的胜利捷报；通过它，传送毛主席对人民群众的亲切关怀；通过它，表达亿万人民对毛主席的无限热爱。
              某部副班长　高延生
    ＊保证毛主席无产阶级司令部的指挥通畅，是我们无限忠于毛主席的体现。接好一个电话，就是我们对无产阶级革命事业贡献的一份力量。
                      某部长途台
    ＊为了保证毛主席无产阶级司令部的指挥通畅，我们愿意一辈子战斗在荒山野岭，当一辈子线路维护兵。
                        某部维护哨
    ＊机房的空间有限，执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的责任无边。
              某部话务员　谢金英
    ＊要排除线路故障，首先要排除思想故障。
                某部班长　魏世春
    ＊对灵魂深处的资产阶级私心，要象对粮仓里的老鼠一样，采取“杀”的办法。光堵不杀，它就会到处“打洞”，危害革命。
              某部司务长　张贵成
