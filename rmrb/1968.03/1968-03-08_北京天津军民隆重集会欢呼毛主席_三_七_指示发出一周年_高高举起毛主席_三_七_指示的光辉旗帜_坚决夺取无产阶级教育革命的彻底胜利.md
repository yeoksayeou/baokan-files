Today, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army held a grand celebration to commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of the great leader Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. This is a victory celebration for the revolutionary achievements made by the revolutionary teachers and students of the capital and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are executing military and political training tasks over the past year under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of new instructions. It is also a mobilization meeting to further implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of new instructions in the new year.

Leaders of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army attended the meeting. Over 2,000 revolutionary teachers and students and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the meeting reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings in the "March 7" directive: "The army should conduct military training in phases and batches for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these, as long as they are done seriously, the problems are not difficult to solve." The meeting emphasized that Chairman Mao's extremely important directive is a great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, learning and using his "March 7" directive and a series of extremely important new instructions in unity, implementing them item by item and comprehensively, is the best commemoration of the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive.

The meeting believed that over the past year, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and with the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the city's primary, secondary, and higher education institutions have presented a vibrant revolutionary scene. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a rain in various schools, and Mao Zedong Thought has been popularized as never before. Revolutionary teachers and students have learned politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eight style, the three major disciplines and eight points of attention from the army, achieving remarkable and inspiring achievements in the process of revolutionization. Now, over 98% of primary and secondary schools in the city have established revolutionary committees. The situation is getting better and better.

The meeting pointed out that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army executing military and political training in various schools in the city have studied Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive most seriously, propagated it most enthusiastically, executed it most resolutely, and defended it most bravely. They have set an example for the revolutionary teachers and students in the city by learning and applying Mao Zedong's works actively, adhering to the four firsts and promoting the three-eight style. They have enthusiastically and voluntarily served as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, fighters against selfishness and public interests, and servants for revolutionary teachers and students. Revolutionary teachers and students should support and love the People's Liberation Army even more, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and help the People's Liberation Army. This is an important part of implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. Revolutionary teachers and students should, under the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army, continue to strive, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of new instructions to strive for more glorious victories.

Representatives of the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from the capital's colleges and universities expressed at the meeting that the revolutionary teachers and students of the capital, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, will bravely advance along the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive! We firmly believe in the army, rely on the army, and learn from the army. Together with the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implement item by item and comprehensively Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of new instructions, and definitely carry the educational revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions to the end, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The representative of the Beijing Military Training Troops expressed at the meeting that they will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, complete the glorious task given by the great leader Chairman Mao to the broad cadres and soldiers of the military training troops to train revolutionary teachers and students, and definitely, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, fight closely and implement comprehensively Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of new instructions, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and turn the schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools, creating new achievements for the people.

The meeting put forward four requirements for further implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive to the revolutionary teachers and students across the city:

First, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, firmly believe in and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, item by item and sentence by sentence. The military training troops and the broad revolutionary teachers and students must, with deep class feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, confront adverse winds and turbulent waves, thoroughly expose the evil plots of the class enemies. At the same time, they must strongly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, overcome anarchist trends, and eliminate interference from all sides in implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive is a matter of stance, which must be recognized at the height of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must defend Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive to the death and resolutely implement it, not stopping until the goal is achieved.

Second, comprehensively implement and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, and vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the necessary path to unify the thoughts of the entire Party, the entire country, and the entire army in the new situation, and the fundamental way to use Mao Zedong Thought to defeat various non-proletarian thoughts. To conduct good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we must vigorously promote the revolutionary study style of learning and applying in unity, linking theory with practice, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts. We must strongly oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism are the two major harms to resuming classes and revolution and deeply implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. We must definitely expose and condemn factionalism and anarchism.

Third, to implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, we must vigorously promote the educational revolution. The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts is the comprehensive victory of the educational revolution. To promote the educational revolution, first, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant educational revolution thoughts. All schools should further carry out the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts and, according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, push the proletarian educational revolution forward. Second, we must use Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts as a weapon, with "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, fully mobilize the masses, and deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, which is an important key to establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Third, we must, according to Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts, thoroughly reform the old educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods.

Fourth, to implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, we must consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. In units where revolutionary committees have been established, we must vigorously promote the revolutionization of revolutionary committees, making revolutionary committees truly become power organs armed with Mao Zedong Thought, highly revolutionary, and highly combative. The broad masses should cherish, respect, support, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees. We must emphasize unity and solidarity based on Mao Zedong Thought, continue to overcome all non-proletarian thoughts and styles, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eight style, and the three major disciplines and eight points of attention from the army, and strengthen organizational discipline." We must grasp the struggle, criticism, and reform in our units, and deeply carry out the educational revolution. Units with mature conditions should, under leadership and in steps, reorganize the Party's organizations and strengthen Party building, making the Party's organizations more pure, stronger, and more vigorous. At the same time, we should also reorganize the Communist Youth League, Red Guards, and various revolutionary mass organizations. In units where revolutionary committees have not been established, we must, based on achieving revolutionary great unity, quickly establish revolutionary committees.

The meeting commended a number of schools that have done an excellent job in implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and called on the proletarian revolutionary factions and all revolutionary teachers and students in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions across the city to catch up with these advanced schools, with the backward catching up with the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions across the city present a more new situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 7th: The revolutionary masses of Tianjin and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, with deep proletarian feelings of infinite love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held a grand gathering today to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive.

One year ago today, the great leader Chairman Mao made a famous "March 7" directive on the report "Experience of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School in Achieving Overall Unity and Reorganizing, Consolidating, and Developing the Red Guards Based on Teaching Classes." In this directive, Chairman Mao taught us: "The army should conduct military training in phases and batches for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these, as long as they are done seriously, the problems are not difficult to solve." This great directive, like a lighthouse shining brightly, illuminates the banks of the Haihe River. Today, 150,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin, holding up Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive placards and holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered in the sea of red flags at the Haihe Central Square to hold a grand meeting. The enthusiastic masses shouted repeatedly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Comrade Xue Xuegang, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Zheng Weishan, Deputy Commander of the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Comrade Zheng Sangeng, leader of the Tianjin garrison of the People's Liberation Army, attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting.

Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive concentrates the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, is a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is a lighthouse guiding the "three supports" and "two militarizations" work of the People's Liberation Army. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of new instructions, Tianjin's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved one victory after another. Now, the city has held over 75,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various types, with over 240,000,000 participants. All 13 districts in the city have established revolutionary committees, and 94% of grassroots units have established revolutionary committees, making the city entirely red.

At today's meeting, representatives of the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School, representatives of the Tianjin Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, University Red Guards, and Middle School Red Guards, enthusiastically discussed the great achievements made in implementing Chairman Mao's great directive over the past year. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry out the great mass movement of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, continue to conduct and conduct well various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with Chairman Mao's new instructions as the key, criticize selfishness and revisionism, annihilate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, cut off black hands, overthrow anarchism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and improve revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, promote the revolutionization of thoughts, further develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. We must be 100 times more vigilant in proletarian revolution, strictly prevent the subversive and disruptive counter-revolutionary plots of domestic and foreign class enemies to sow discord and create trouble. We must forever hold high the banner of the "March 7" directive, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, strive for new victories in the educational revolution, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strive to turn Tianjin into a red Mao Zedong Thought school for the people!

After the meeting, 150,000 military and civilian personnel held a grand parade to celebrate.

    北京天津军民隆重集会欢呼毛主席“三·七”指示发出一周年
    高高举起毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉旗帜
    坚决夺取无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利
    新华社七日讯　今天，北京市革命委员会和人民解放军北京卫戍区举行庆祝大会，隆重纪念伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示发出一周年。这是首都广大革命师生和执行军政训练任务的人民解放军指战员，检阅过去一年在毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下取得丰硕革命成果的祝捷大会，也是在新的一年里进一步落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的誓师大会。
    北京市革命委员会、人民解放军北京卫戍区负责人，出席了大会。参加大会的两千多名革命师生和解放军指战员，重温了毛主席在“三·七”指示中的伟大教导：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。所有这些，只要认真去做，问题并不难解决。”大会强调指出，毛主席这一极其重要的指示，是关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利具有伟大的意义。无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列极为重要的最新指示，学用一致，条条落实，全面落实，是对毛主席“三·七”指示发出一周年的最好纪念。
    大会认为，一年来，在毛主席的“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，全市大、中、小学校出现一派热气腾腾的革命景象。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋一样在各个学校发展起来，毛泽东思想得到了前所未有的大普及。广大革命师生向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，在革命化的道路上取得了令人振奋的巨大成绩。现在，全市已经有百分之九十八以上的中小学校建立了革命委员会。形势越来越好。
    大会指出，在全市各学校执行军政训练的解放军同志，对毛主席的“三·七”指示学习得最认真，宣传得最热情，执行得最坚决，捍卫得最英勇。他们言教身教，以身作则，把人民解放军的好思想好传统好作风传给了全市广大革命师生。他们在全市广大革命师生中间做出了活学活用毛主席著作的好样子，坚持四个第一、发扬三八作风的好样子。他们热情地自觉地当毛泽东思想的宣传员，破私立公的战斗员，为革命师生服务的勤务员。广大革命师生要更加拥护和热爱解放军，学习解放军，帮助解放军。这是我们贯彻执行毛主席“三·七”指示的重要内容。革命师生要在人民解放军的大力帮助下，再接再厉，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，去争取更辉煌的胜利。
    首都大专院校、中等学校红代会和革命师生的代表在会上表示，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的首都广大革命师生决心沿着毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉道路奋勇前进！我们坚决相信解放军，依靠解放军，学习解放军。和全国亿万军民一起，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，条条落实，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，一定要把大、中、小学校的教育革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    北京军训部队代表在会上表示，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给军训部队广大指战员训练革命师生的光荣任务，一定要和广大革命师生紧密团结，共同战斗，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，为人民立新功。
    大会向全市广大革命师生提出了进一步贯彻执行毛主席“三·七”指示的四点要求：
    一、无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的“三·七”指示，要坚信不疑，坚定不移，条条照办，句句落实。军训部队和广大革命师生，必须怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，顶逆风，战恶浪，彻底揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。同时，大力克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，克服无政府主义思潮，排除来自各个方面对落实毛主席伟大战略部署的干扰。对待毛主席的“三·七”指示采取什么态度，这是一个立场问题，一定要提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。我们要誓死捍卫毛主席的“三·七”指示，坚决落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，不达目的，决不罢休。
    二、全面落实、坚决贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。毛主席教导我们：
  “办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”毛泽东思想学习班，是在新形势下，统一全党、全国、全军思想的必由之路，是用毛泽东思想战胜各种非无产阶级思想的根本途径。办好毛泽东思想学习班，必须大兴学用一致、理论联系实际的革命好学风，促进人的思想革命化。要大反资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，大反无政府主义。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义是当前复课闹革命和深入落实毛主席“三·七”指示的两大害。我们一定要把派性和无政府主义搞臭。
    三、贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示，要大力抓好教育革命。毛主席教育革命思想的全面落实，就是教育革命的全面胜利。抓好教育革命，第一，要认真学好毛主席教育革命的光辉思想。所有的学校，都应当进一步深入开展学习毛主席教育革命思想的群众运动，按照毛主席所指引的方向，把无产阶级教育革命向前推进一步。第二，要以毛主席教育革命思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，充分发动群众，深入开展对反革命修正主义教育路线的革命大批判，这是大立毛主席无产阶级教育路线的重要关键。第三，要按照毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，对旧的教育制度、教学内容、教学方法，进行彻底的改革。
    四、落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，要巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。在已经成立革命委员会的单位，必须大抓革命委员会的革命化，使革命委员会真正成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的、非常革命化、非常战斗化的权力机构。广大群众，对于新生的革命委员会，要爱护它，尊重它，支持它，保卫它。要强调在毛泽东思想基础上的团结、统一，继续克服一切非无产阶级的思想和作风，坚决按照毛主席的教导，“向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性。”要抓好本单位的斗、批、改，深入开展教育革命。条件成熟的单位，要有领导、有步骤地整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，使党的组织更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加朝气蓬勃。同时还要整顿共青团、红卫兵和各革命群众组织。没有成立革命委员会的单位，要在实现革命大联合的基础上，迅速把革命委员会建立起来。
    大会表扬了一批贯彻毛主席“三·七”指示做得很有成绩的学校，号召全市大中小学校的无产阶级革命派和全体革命师生，向这些先进学校看齐，后进赶先进，先进更先进，使全市大中小学校的无产阶级文化大革命，出现更加崭新的局面。
