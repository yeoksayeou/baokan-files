Workers from several factories in Beijing hold a revolutionary criticism meeting

Time: March 11th afternoon
Location: Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress
Attendees: Workers from Beijing Thermal Power Plant, Beijing Second General Machinery Factory, Beijing Paper Mill, Beijing Valve Factory, and other factories, including old workers, young apprentices, technicians, and chemical analysts, totaling more than ten people. Host: Jin Shuliang, member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress. Recorders: Reporters from Beijing Workers' Newspaper and this newspaper.

The workers, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, a strong sense of responsibility to the country and the people, and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, came to the meeting. They had just taken off their work clothes and rushed from all directions.

The host announced the start of the meeting, first studying Chairman Mao's quotations, and then everyone held a discussion.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the chief propagandist of anarchism

Host: Today, under the national situation of great progress, we hold this criticism meeting, which is of great significance.

Many factories and mines in Beijing have established revolutionary committees. However, the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution approaches victory, the more the enemy is unwilling to perish and will make desperate struggles, engaging in sabotage and disruption.

Currently, the anarchist trend in some factories is a tool used by the enemy to spread the "selfish" thoughts in our minds, aiming to overthrow our newly established revolutionary committees.

Anarchism and bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism are birds of a feather. Their root cause is the Chinese Khrushchev. In the past, we criticized the slave mentality he peddled. In fact, anarchism is also one of his counter-revolutionary tricks. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, when they usurped part of the power of our party and state, vigorously promoted slave mentality, wanting us to be their "tame tools" for restoring capitalism. When the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned, they crazily implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing the revolutionary faction. When the revolutionary faction seized power from them, they spread the fallacy of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," vigorously promoting anarchism, attempting to create chaos so they could "overthrow the heavens."

The ideological source of anarchism is also bourgeois individualism. The Chinese Khrushchev spread a large amount of bourgeois individualist fallacies. In industrial and mining enterprises, he opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, opposed studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promoted material incentives. One of its poisons is the current appearance of anarchism.

The Chinese Khrushchev, as early as before liberation, under the guise of the mass line, peddled anarchist black goods. He advocated that the masses "should do whatever they want," saying that the Communist Party "must and mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses." Here, party leadership was completely abolished by him.

Anarchism is a reactionary trend. If we do not thoroughly overthrow it, it will affect our revolution and production, and affect all work. Anarchism is an obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must mobilize the masses to launch a "people's war" to eradicate anarchism.

Gao Wen'gang: (He is a chemical analyst from Beijing Second General Machinery Factory. As soon as the host finished speaking, he eagerly wanted to speak. As soon as he mentioned the Chinese Khrushchev, he became furious.)

This poison of anarchism is a piece of junk picked up by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places when they were at their wits' end.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." However, the Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about how the Communist Party "must and mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses," saying that the masses "should do whatever they want." The root of the tree, the source of the water, think about the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, look at the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev, and you will understand that the Chinese Khrushchev is the source of anarchism. Once this poisonous root is found, it must be dug out. Especially for young people, who lack experience in class struggle and are easily deceived, we must learn from this experience and lesson.

In our Second General Machinery Factory, during the period when anarchist trends were rampant in society, some young workers were also poisoned by anarchism. Many old workers patiently criticized and educated them. In the factory-wide campaign to eradicate the poison of anarchism, we thoroughly uprooted the poisonous root of anarchism planted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Be vigilant against class enemies using sabotage to disrupt the revolution

Wang Zhiquan: (He is an old worker and shift supervisor from Beijing Thermal Power Plant. He started as an apprentice in Beijing at the age of 15 and has been working for over 40 years.)

In the past, the capitalist roaders in our factory, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, promoted material incentives, expert path, bonus system, and technical first, not allowing us to study Chairman Mao's works. When the masses demanded to study Chairman Mao's works, they used every means to disrupt and sabotage. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they used every means to disrupt the revolution and production, spreading the reactionary anarchist evil winds and mists. At first, they used production to suppress the revolution, then they tried to disrupt production and sabotage the revolution, sitting on the sidelines watching the jokes of the proletarian revolutionary faction. They used all kinds of methods, open and covert, hard and soft, and when they had used them all, reactionary anarchism became their good helper. The black words of anarchism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev became their good weapon for counter-revolutionary activities.

However, we, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction, have one heart, that is, to take the lead in revolution and be the pioneers in production! Wherever Chairman Mao speaks, we strike there. We treat the workshop as a battlefield. Not only did we achieve great success in seizing the revolution, exposing the capitalist roaders and bad leaders, realizing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and establishing the revolutionary committee, but we also completed the production plan well, ensuring the power supply for industry and agriculture in the Beijing region, and strongly supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." Therefore, we must fight to the end with reactionary anarchism, concentrating all our hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev!

"The masses educate themselves"

Is not about not having revolutionary discipline

Zhao Shumu: (He is an old worker from Beijing Second General Machinery Factory.)

Our workshop was also influenced by this reactionary trend of anarchism, manifested in some people's lax labor discipline. This reactionary trend is more prevalent among young workers. Its root cause is the biggest capitalist roader within the party, the Chinese Khrushchev. He is a thorough counter-revolutionary two-faced person. One black hand holds the knife of slave mentality, and the other black hand holds the knife of anarchism. These two knives are his two major tools for counter-revolutionary activities. His evil purpose is to restore capitalism in our country. Listen to his black words, and you know how he opposes our great leader Chairman Mao. He blathers on about how the masses "should do whatever they want," which is a thorough anarchism that does not want party leadership! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you want a revolution, you must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party established according to Marxism-Leninism revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." Chairman Mao also teaches us: Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship, "within the people, there must be no freedom without discipline; there must be no democracy without centralization." However, the Chinese Khrushchev completely opposes Mao Zedong Thought, wanting individuals to do as they please, do whatever they want to do, like whatever they want to do, and do it however they want! Letting bourgeois, petty-bourgeois thoughts spread everywhere.

Those who are poisoned by the anarchism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev still defend themselves, saying, "This is 'self-education, self-liberation,' others can't interfere." Is this really the masses educating themselves? The masses educating themselves is not letting the masses run wild as the Chinese Khrushchev spreads, but under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, firmly and unshakably using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform the bourgeois thoughts in our minds!

We old workers have suffered deeply in the old society. We know what class exploitation and class struggle are. We will not fall for the anarchism of the Chinese Khrushchev. We know that not going to work casually and casually touching the production equipment, this anarchism will bring great losses to the country. To thoroughly overthrow anarchism, we must arm the minds of the working class with the great Mao Zedong Thought. We, the working class, will definitely follow Chairman Mao's highest instructions and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary poison of anarchism.

Obey labor discipline and overthrow anarchism

Yan Jingkai: (He is an old fitter from the repair workshop of Beijing Thermal Power Plant.)

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders in the factory are frantically spreading anarchist black words, attempting to disintegrate our proletarian dictatorship and disintegrate our newly established revolutionary committees, truly deserving to die!

The capitalist roaders and bad leaders in our factory also spread the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev that the masses "should do whatever they want." Just last year, when our factory went to Baoding to complete a major overhaul task, the leadership had already decided to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production" and ensure the completion of the major overhaul task. However, the capitalist roaders in our factory spread the black words of "whoever goes to Baoding for the overhaul is selling their lives," using this to oppose Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production" and disrupt the overhaul task. I was so angry when I heard these words. I said, we, the working class, must not be influenced by this reactionary anarchist trend, we must do well for Chairman Mao, complete the overhaul task well, and use actual actions to counter the sabotage of a handful of capitalist roaders. After more than twenty days of hard work, we finally completed the overhaul task, giving our factory's capitalist roaders a heavy blow.

However, the class enemies are not dead yet, especially after the great unity, the capitalist roaders and bad leaders in our factory are frantically spreading the black words of anarchism of the Chinese Khrushchev among the masses, letting the masses "not go to meetings, leave after work, preserve strength," and so on, to disrupt the great unity and disrupt production.

We, the working class, love Chairman Mao infinitely and are loyal to Chairman Mao. I have always insisted on doing a good job in production. Someone said to me: "Yan, now you work day and night like this, even if you die from overwork, no one will praise you." I immediately replied: "I work for the construction of socialism, not to be praised by others." The Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in our factory want to disrupt the revolution, hoping that we will sit and do nothing. We will not do this. The capitalist roaders want us not to obey labor discipline and not to work, we will work even harder, to smash their tricks. In the past, we were cruelly oppressed by the capitalists, working day and night like cattle and horses. Today, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party lead us to stand up, with an eight-hour workday, this eight-hour workday is exchanged with the blood and sacrifice of countless martyrs, if we do not insist on working well, how can we repay Chairman Mao? We must thoroughly criticize anarchism and resolutely overthrow it!

Overfulfilling production tasks

Is a powerful counterattack against the Chinese Khrushchev

Kou Changkui: (He is an old worker from Beijing Paper Mill.)

I'll talk about it. Now, some factories spread the black words that the masses "should do whatever they want," this is purely the nonsense logic of the Chinese Khrushchev. What class says what, the Chinese Khrushchev's pig mouth can't spit out ivory. This is an attempt to make us, the working class, not have party leadership, not have organizational discipline. This is a reactionary anarchist cliché!

However, our factory has many old workers, everyone has gone through hard times, no one can forget the suffering in the past, so we love our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party even more from the bottom of our hearts. Our factory has always overfulfilled the national production plan during the Cultural Revolution. Our factory is responsible for producing paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. Workers understand that completing the production task one day ahead is adding one more force to the world revolution. In the production of large-character posters, we realize that this is a tool for carrying out revolutionary criticism. Producing one more large-character poster paper is adding one more force to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, firing one more cannon at the enemy. Therefore, we have always completed our production tasks well, which is also a powerful counterattack against the anarchism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the crime of disrupting production.

Criticize and thoroughly expose anarchism to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions

Li Xiuying: (This old worker from Beijing Valve Factory, who stood up during the land reform, participated in the revolution, and joined the Communist Party of China, was already excited after listening to the criticism of the above old workers.)

I sit here, my heart is very excited. Anarchism is really terrible. It also has an impact in our factory, causing our factory to have a period of loose discipline and scattered thoughts, especially some young people, who are deeply poisoned. The old workers see this and feel pain in their hearts, but the enemy sees this and is happy. Those who are poisoned still do not realize it, saying that this is "self-education, self-liberation." This is completely a distortion.

Anarchism is really harmful. If we do not overthrow it, we cannot strengthen the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, we cannot fight better, we cannot fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we cannot follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we cannot grasp the revolution and promote production. We, the working class, have confidence and will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to resolutely overthrow anarchism, expose it, and thoroughly eliminate it from within the working class.

Jin Chenghe: (This young apprentice from Beijing Valve Factory, born and raised under the red flag, said on this criticism meeting that he received a vivid political education.)

The Chinese Khrushchev poisons and corrupts the souls of our young people, leading our young people astray. The anarchist black goods he peddles say that the masses "should do whatever they want"! This is to make our young people develop a free and easy attitude in work, doing whatever they want. If he guides us like this, how can we build a socialist motherland? How can we carry on the revolution of the older generation!

The Chinese Khrushchev says these anarchist black words, deliberately sabotaging the stage of the working class! If we listen to his nonsense, we will become a heap of loose sand, losing the power to struggle. We are workers who manufacture valves. Our lathe work is all assembly line work. If we do whatever we want, the finished products won't match, they won't leave the factory, how can we build socialism? He wants us not to have party leadership, this is simply a pipe dream. This old counter-revolutionary actually wants a bourgeois government and to restore capitalism. Let me tell you, Chinese Khrushchev, your calculations are wrong. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do it. We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, resolutely obey the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, and become red successors!

Hou Kangyong: (A young technician from the Third Plant of Beijing Paper Mill.)

I'll also talk about it. The essence of anarchism is to oppose proletarian dictatorship.

Those who are poisoned by anarchism put "me" first in everything. They are the vanguard of protecting "self." We must shout at those who are entangled by the poisonous snake of anarchism: Comrade! You have taken the wrong path! The current anarchist reactionary trend rampant in some factories and the anarchist black words spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the masses "should do whatever they want," are inseparable. This anarchist trend is a weapon thrown out by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices after they were exposed, a weapon of desperate struggle.

Anarchism is a reactionary trend that disrupts Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, obstructs the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, disrupts the newly established revolutionary committees, and disrupts proletarian dictatorship. We, the working class, must thoroughly eliminate it and its root cause, the Chinese Khrushchev.

Host: (Looking at the time, it's already late, announcing the end of today's speeches.)

Today, the meeting was very good. We all learned a lot. We do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, anarchism will have nowhere to hide. We put "public" first, and "self" will be less. For us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, the closer we are to revolutionary victory, the better the situation is, the more we must be vigilant against the class enemy corrupting our thoughts. Currently, we must resolutely eliminate the reactionary poison of anarchism, letting Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in the minds of each of us.

Finally, the criticism meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的无政府主义谬论
    ——北京几个工厂工人革命大批判座谈会纪实
    时　间：三月十一日下午
    地　点：北京市工代会
    出席人：北京热电厂、北京第二通用机械厂、北
            京造纸总厂、北京阀门厂等厂的老工人、
            青年徒工、技术员和化验员等十多人。主持人：北京市革命委员会委员、北京市工代会常委金树良。
    记　录：《北京工人》报记者、本报记者。
    工人同志们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，抱着对国家、对人民高度的责任感，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，前来参加会议。他们都是刚刚换下工作服，就从四面八方赶来的。
    主持人宣布开会，先学习毛主席语录，然后大家座谈。
  中国赫鲁晓夫是无政府主义的吹鼓手
  主持人：今天，在全国大好形势下，我们来开这个批判座谈会，是有重要意义的。
    北京许多厂矿都成立了革命委员会。但是，无产阶级文化大革命愈接近胜利，敌人愈是不甘心灭亡，必然会作垂死的挣扎，从事破坏和捣乱。
    当前，在某些工厂中存在的无政府主义思潮，就是敌人利用我们头脑里的“私”字来散布的，目的是想搞垮我们新生的革命委员会。
    无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一丘之貉，它们的总根子就是中国赫鲁晓夫。过去，我们大家批判了他贩卖的奴隶主义黑货，其实，无政府主义也是他的一手反革命看家本领。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，当他们篡夺了我们党和国家的一部分权力的时候，就大肆鼓吹奴隶主义，要我们当他们复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”；当无产阶级文化大革命的烈火燃烧起来的时候，他们就疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命派；当无产阶级革命派起来从他们手里夺权的时候，他们就散布“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的谬论，大肆鼓吹无政府主义，妄想把我们搞乱，他们就可以“翻天”。
    无政府主义的思想根源也是资产阶级个人主义。中国赫鲁晓夫散布了大量的资产阶级个人主义的谬论。他在工矿企业里反对突出无产阶级政治，反对活学活用毛主席著作，大搞物质刺激。它的流毒之一，就是现在出现的无政府主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫早在解放前就打着群众路线的幌子，贩卖无政府主义的黑货。他鼓吹群众“要怎么办就怎么办”，说共产党“必须、而且主要依靠群众的自发运动”。这里，党的领导就被他完全取消了。
    无政府主义是一种反动的思潮，不彻底打倒它，就会影响我们的革命和生产，影响一切工作。无政府主义是我们落实毛主席最新指示的障碍，我们一定要放手发动群众，打一场围剿无政府主义的“人民战争”。
    高文岗：（他是北京第二通用机械厂的化验员。主持人的话音刚落，他就急着要发言。一提到中国赫鲁晓夫，他就冒了火。）
    无政府主义这服毒剂，是中国赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人，在山穷水尽之后，重新拾起来的破烂货。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”毛主席还教导我们：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。而中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么共产党“必须、而且主要依靠群众的自发运动”。说什么群众“要怎么办就怎么办”。树有根，水有源，想想伟大领袖毛主席的教导，看看中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话，不就明白中国赫鲁晓夫正是无政府主义的根源吗？这棵毒根找到了，就要挖到底。特别是青年人因为阶级斗争经验少容易上当，要从中吸取经验教训。
    我们第二通用机械厂在社会上无政府主义思潮泛滥的时候，也有一些青年工人中了无政府主义的流毒。不少老工人对他们进行了耐心的批评和教育。在全厂大扫无政府主义的流毒中，狠狠地挖出了中国赫鲁晓夫这棵无政府主义的毒根。警惕阶级敌人用破坏生产来破坏革命
    王之千：（他是北京热电厂老工人，汽机值班长。他十五岁上北京当学徒，到现在有四十多年的工龄了。）
    过去，我们厂里的走资派，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，大搞物质刺激，专家路线，奖金挂帅，技术第一，不让我们学习毛主席著作。群众要求学习毛主席著作，他们想尽办法，千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们又想尽一切办法，破坏革命和生产，大放反动的无政府主义的妖风黑雾。开始，他们以生产压革命，后来又想搞乱生产，破坏革命，坐在一边看咱们无产阶级革命派的笑话。他们明的，暗的，硬的，软的，都用得差不多的时候，反动的无政府主义就成了他们的好助手。中国赫鲁晓夫散布的无政府主义的黑话，就成了他们进行反革命活动的好武器。
    可是，我们广大的无产阶级革命派，就有一个心眼儿，那就是抓革命当先锋，促生产当闯将！毛主席他老人家说到那里，我们就打到那里。我们把车间当战场，不但在抓革命上取得了很大的成绩，揪出了走资派和坏头头，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会，而且在生产上也很好地完成了生产计划，保证了北京地区的工农业用电，有力地支援了首都的无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛主席教导我们说：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。所以我们就一定要和反动的无政府主义干到底，把千仇万恨都集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上！“群众自己教育自己”
  绝不是不要革命纪律
    赵树木：（他是北京第二通用机械厂的老工人。）
    我们车间里也受到无政府主义这股反动思潮的影响，表现为一些人劳动纪律涣散。这种反动的思潮，在青年工人中散布比较多。它的总根子就是党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫。他是一个不折不扣的反革命两面派。他一只黑手拿着奴隶主义的刀子，一只黑手拿着无政府主义的刀子。这两把刀子，是他进行反革命活动的两大工具。他的罪恶目的，就是要在我们国家复辟资本主义。咱们听听他散布的黑话，就知道他是怎么对抗我们伟大领袖毛主席的。他胡说群众“要怎么办就怎么办”，这真是彻头彻尾的不要党的领导的无政府主义！我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”毛主席还教导我们：我们的国家是一个人民民主专政的国家，“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。”可是中国赫鲁晓夫却大反毛泽东思想，要个人随心所欲，为所欲为，喜欢干什么，就干什么，爱怎么干，就怎么干！让资产阶级、小资产阶级思想到处泛滥。
    中了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的这种无政府主义的毒的人，还替自己辩护说，我这是“自己教育自己，自己解放自己”，别人管不着。这难道真是群众自己教育自己吗？群众自己教育自己，绝不是象中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的让群众放任自流，而是要在毛主席和党中央领导下，坚定不移地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想改造自己头脑里的资产阶级思想！
    我们老工人受旧社会的苦深，我们懂得什么是阶级剥削，什么是阶级斗争。我们绝不上中国赫鲁晓夫那套无政府主义的当。我们懂得随便不上班，随便动一下生产设备，这种无政府主义会给国家带来多大的损失。要彻底打倒无政府主义，就必须用伟大的毛泽东思想武装我们工人阶级的头脑，我们工人阶级一定坚决按照毛主席的最高指示办事，把反动的无政府主义流毒彻底肃清。
  遵守劳动纪律打倒无政府主义
    颜景凯：（他是北京热电厂修配场老钳工。）
    毛主席教导我们：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。可是中国赫鲁晓夫和工厂里的一小撮走资派，却拚命地散布无政府主义的黑话，妄想瓦解我们的无产阶级专政，瓦解我们新生的革命委员会，真是罪该万死！
    我们厂里的走资派和坏头头还到处散布中国赫鲁晓夫的群众“要怎么办就怎么办”的黑话。就在我们厂去年有一次到保定去完成大修任务时，领导上已作了决定，要坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，保证完成大修任务。可我们厂里的走资派却散布什么“谁去保定大修就是卖命”，以此对抗毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，破坏大修任务。我听到这些话后，气坏了。我说，我们工人阶级绝不能受这种反动的无政府主义思潮影响，一定要为毛主席争气，把大修任务搞好，以实际行动回击一小撮走资派的破坏。经过二十多天的奋战，我们终于完成了大修任务，给了我厂走资派一个重重的打击。
    但是，阶级敌人贼心不死，特别在大联合以后，我们厂里的走资派和坏头头在群众中极力散布中国赫鲁晓夫的无政府主义的黑话，让群众“开会不去，下班就走，保存实力”等等，来破坏大联合，破坏生产。
    我们工人阶级无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席。我始终坚持搞好生产，有人对我说：“颜师傅，现在你这样成天累月的干活，累死了也没人说你好。”我马上回答说：“我干活是为了社会主义建设，而不是为了要别人说我好。”中国赫鲁晓夫和我厂走资派为了破坏革命，就是希望我们坐着不干活，我们决不能这样做。走资派妄想我们不遵守劳动纪律，不干活，我们就更要认真干，要粉碎他们的阴谋诡计。过去我们受资本家残酷的压迫，不分白天黑夜当牛当马地干。今天毛主席和共产党领导我们翻了身，有了八小时工作制，这八小时是无数先烈流血牺牲换来的，我们不好好坚持工作，怎么对得起毛主席他老人家啊！我们一定要大反无政府主义，坚决把无政府主义打倒！超额完成生产任务
  是对中国赫鲁晓夫
  的有力回击
    寇长魁：（他是北京造纸总厂的老工人。）
    我来说说。现在有些厂里流传的群众“要怎么办就怎么办”，这黑话纯粹是中国赫鲁晓夫的混蛋逻辑。什么阶级说什么话，中国赫鲁晓夫猪嘴里吐不出象牙。这是妄图叫我们工人阶级不要党的领导，不要组织纪律。这是反动的无政府主义滥调！
    可是，我们厂里老工人很多，大家都是打苦里过来的，谁都忘不了过去受的苦，因此也更加从心眼儿里热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席和共产党。我们厂在文化大革命中一直是超额完成国家生产计划的。我们厂担负了生产印毛主席著作纸张的光荣任务。工人们懂得提前完成一天生产任务，就是对世界革命多增加一分力量。在生产大字报用纸中，我们认识到这是开展革命大批判的工具，多生产一张大字报用纸，就是对狠批中国赫鲁晓夫多增加一分力量，多向敌人投射一颗炮弹。因此，我们生产任务一直完成得很好，这也是对中国赫鲁晓夫散布的无政府主义，破坏生产的罪行的一个有力回击。
  批倒批臭无政府主义全面落实毛主席最新指示
    李秀英：（这个在土改中翻了身，参加了革命，参加了中国共产党的北京阀门厂老工人，听了上面几位老工人的批判，早已按捺不住自己的激动心情。）
    我坐在这里，心情十分激动。无政府主义这东西，真是坏透了。它在我们厂里也有影响，害得我们厂里有一阵纪律松弛，思想涣散，特别是有些青年人，中毒较深。老师傅看着，痛在心里，可敌人看见喜在眉头。中了毒的人，还不自觉，还说什么，这是“自己解放自己”。这完全是一种歪曲。
    无政府主义真是害人不浅，不打倒它，就不能加强无产阶级的革命纪律性，就不能更好地战斗，就不能全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就不能抓革命，促生产。我们工人阶级有信心，一定以毛泽东思想为武器，坚决把无政府主义打倒，搞臭，把它从我们工人阶级内部彻底清除掉。
    靳成和：（这个生在红旗下，长在红旗下的青年，北京阀门厂的青年徒工，正象他自己所说，在这个批判会上，他受到了一次生动的政治教育。）
    中国赫鲁晓夫放毒腐蚀我们青年人的灵魂，引诱我们青年人走邪路。他贩卖的无政府主义的黑货，说什么群众“要怎么办就怎么办”！就是让我们青年人养成在工作上想干什么就干什么的自由散漫的思想作风。照他这样“引导”，我们还怎么能建设社会主义的祖国呢！还怎么能接革命老前辈的班呢！
    中国赫鲁晓夫说这些无政府主义的黑话，就是成心拆我们工人阶级的台！如果听了他的鬼话，我们就成了一盘散沙，失去了斗争的力量。我们是制造阀门的工人，我们车工活都是流水作业，假如想干什么就干什么，成品配不了套，出不了厂，这怎么能建设社会主义呢？他让我们不要党的领导，这简直是痴心妄想。这个老牌反革命，实际要的是资产阶级的政府，复辟资本主义。告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫，你的算盘打错了，我们一定跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，我们一定好好活学活用毛主席著作，坚决遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，做个红色的接班人！
    侯康永：（北京造纸总厂三分厂的青年工艺技术员。）
    我也来谈谈，无政府主义的要害就是反对无产阶级专政。
    中了无政府主义毒的人，是万事“我”当先。他们是保“私”的尖兵。我们要向那些被无政府主义毒蛇缠身的人，大喝一声：同志！你走错了路！当前有些工厂里泛滥着的无政府主义反动思潮，和中国赫鲁晓夫所散布过的那些无政府主义黑话，如群众“要怎么办就怎么办”是分不开的。这种无政府主义思潮，是中国赫鲁晓夫和他的同伙被揪出来以后，抛出的一件垂死挣扎的武器。
    无政府主义，是干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，阻碍毛主席最新指示的全面落实，破坏新生的革命委员会，破坏无产阶级专政的反动思潮，我们工人阶级一定要把它和它的总根子中国赫鲁晓夫连根彻底清除。
    主持人：（看看时间已经不早了，宣布结束今天的发言。）
    今天，会开得很好，我们大家都学到了不少东西。我们处处按毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，无政府主义就会无处藏身。我们“公”字当头，“私”字就会少了。对我们无产阶级革命派来说，愈是在革命接近胜利的时刻，形势大好的情况下，愈要警惕阶级敌人腐蚀我们的思想。当前我们要坚决把反动的无政府主义流毒彻底肃清，让毛泽东思想在我们每个人的头脑中深深扎根。
    最后，批判会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
