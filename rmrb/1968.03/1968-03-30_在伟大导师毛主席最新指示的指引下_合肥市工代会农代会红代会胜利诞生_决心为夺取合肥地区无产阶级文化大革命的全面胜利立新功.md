Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Workers' Congress, the Red Guards' Congress, and the Farmers' Congress in Hefei have been born victoriously. They are determined to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution in the Hefei region.

A Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Hefei, March 29th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Workers' Congress, the Red Guards' Congress in colleges and universities, and the Farmers' Congress in the suburbs of Hefei have been born victoriously. This is a result of the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards in the Hefei region, who, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, taken "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the key link, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and consolidated and developed the fruits of revolutionary unity.

Over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards in the Hefei region have high-held the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, they have undergone severe tests and tempering. They have smashed the illusions of Chinese Khrushchev and his local agents to restore capitalism, bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and made great contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Anhui Province.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were transmitted, the broad revolutionary masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards in the Hefei region, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, swiftly launched a high tide of revolutionary unity. With the strong support and help of the People's Liberation Army, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and launched a "people's war" to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends, effectively consolidating and developing revolutionary unity in the Hefei region.

The leaders of the 6408 Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the Anhui garrison, including Li Degeng, Zhang Wenbi, Liao Chengmei, and Song Peizhuang, attended the founding ceremonies of the three congresses. Li Degeng, on behalf of the 6408 Unit and all the officers and soldiers of the Anhui garrison, extended warm congratulations to the Workers' Congress, the Farmers' Congress, and the Red Guards' Congress. He praised the great victories achieved by the broad revolutionary masses in the Cultural Revolution over the past year and hoped that they would, in future battles, remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "being modest, prudent, guarding against arrogance and impetuousness," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the key link, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, and promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They should resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "all schools, big, medium, and small, should resume classes and make revolution," continue to strive for victory, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution in the Hefei region.

During the congress, the representatives of the Workers' Congress, the Farmers' Congress, and the Red Guards' Congress repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, discussed the excellent situation in the country, Anhui Province, and Hefei City, exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, developing and consolidating revolutionary unity, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and studied future tasks.

The three congresses unanimously adopted a telegram of congratulations to Chairman Mao and respectively adopted the "Appeal to Revolutionary Workers in the Province," the "Resolution and Constitution of the Farmers' Congress," and the "Letter to All Red Guards in the City."
