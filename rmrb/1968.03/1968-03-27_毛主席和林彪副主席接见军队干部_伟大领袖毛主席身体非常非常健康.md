In the midst of a great situation both domestically and internationally, and amidst the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, recently received military cadres. This is the greatest care and encouragement for our army.

Those who were received include: cadres at the regiment level and above from the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, various military branches, military academies in Beijing, units under the Beijing Military Region, cadres from various military regions participating in study classes and meetings in Beijing, and cadres participating in "three supports, two militaries" in Beijing, totaling more than ten thousand people.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, and Wang Dongxing accompanied the reception.

Before the reception, Vice Chairman Lin, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, gave an extremely important directive to those who were received. Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan also gave important speeches.

The great leader Chairman Mao is in extremely good health, full of vigor, and walked energetically to the reception venue, clapping warmly and enthusiastically for a long time for the military cadres who were received.

When Chairman Mao appeared, the entire venue immediately boiled over. These military cadres, who have been personally led by the great helmsman Chairman Mao and educated by Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, have, over a long period of struggle, harbored the deepest proletarian sentiments for the great creator of our great Party, our great country, and the great People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao. Now, at this happiest moment, they are extremely moved, tears welling up in their eyes, and with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great teacher, great leader, and great helmsman, they raised high the red revolutionary treasure, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" "Wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to reform their worldview, to closely follow the great strategic deployments of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and to swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, not resting until complete victory is achieved!

At the end of the reception, everyone in the venue sang "The Boatman's Song" and "The Internationale." The entire venue once again shouted for a long time, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"
