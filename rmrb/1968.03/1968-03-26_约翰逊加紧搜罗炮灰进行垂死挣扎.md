	Johnson Hurriedly Recruits Cannon Fodder in a Desperate Struggle

	BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) — Amidst Johnson's recent clamor to escalate the Vietnam War, the U.S. government has decided to intensify the recruitment of cannon fodder domestically, attempting to replenish the heavy losses suffered by U.S. aggressor forces in Vietnam and make a desperate struggle.

	According to an announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense on the 19th, the U.S. government will recruit 44,000 soldiers for the army in May, and it is estimated that the total number of recruits for the entire year will reach 322,000, an increase of 72,000 over 1967.

	The recruitment number for May is the third time since the U.S. launched the Vietnam War that the number has exceeded 40,000, following October of last year and April of this year.

	This indicates that the Johnson administration, despite being in a predicament of internal and external difficulties and a shortage of manpower, is still eager to engage in military adventurism. However, under the increasingly fierce attacks of the heroic Vietnamese military and people, no matter how frantically the U.S. imperialists struggle, they cannot escape their already doomed fate of failure.

    约翰逊加紧搜罗炮灰进行垂死挣扎
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：在美帝头目约翰逊连日来一片扩大侵越战争的叫嚣声中，美国政府决定在国内继续加紧搜罗炮灰，妄图填补侵越战场上美国侵略军的惨重伤亡，进行垂死挣扎。
    据美国国防部十九日宣布，美国政府五月份将为陆军征兵四万四千人，并且预计今年全年的征兵数额将达到三十万二千人，比一九六七年多征七万二千人。
    美国政府五月份的征兵数额，是美国发动侵越战争以来，继去年十月和今年四月后第三次突破四万大关。
    这表明，约翰逊政府在内外交困、兵源枯竭的窘迫情况下还要加紧进行军事冒险。但是，在英雄的越南军民越来越猛烈的打击下，不管美帝国主义如何疯狂挣扎，都无法摆脱它已经注定失败的命运。
