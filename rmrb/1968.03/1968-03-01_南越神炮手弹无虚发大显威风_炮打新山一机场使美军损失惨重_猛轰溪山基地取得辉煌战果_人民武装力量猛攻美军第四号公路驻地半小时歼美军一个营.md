Vietnamese God Gunners Strike with Precision, Inflicting Heavy Losses on U.S. Forces

The god gunners of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces have recently demonstrated their prowess, turning U.S. and puppet military bases and camps into shooting ranges. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and is in a state of constant fear, day and night.

The New Mountain One base in Saigon has almost become a daily target for the god gunners of the People's Liberation Armed Forces. On the morning of the 27th, the artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously struck New Mountain One base, the Bien Hoa Air Base, the U.S. logistics port on the Saigon River, the U.S. 9th Infantry Division base near Saigon, the puppet military's Guard De Infantry School, a puppet military regiment headquarters, and a U.S. special forces camp. At New Mountain One base, a few shells from the god gunners of the People's Liberation Armed Forces destroyed or damaged twelve enemy aircraft.

In the area south of the demilitarized zone, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Quang Tri Province continuously attacked and bombarded the U.S. base at Khe Sanh and other bases from the 23rd to the 26th.

The besieged U.S. forces at Khe Sanh have been under heavy artillery fire from the People's Liberation Armed Forces every day, forcing the American invaders to stay in their bunkers day and night. The People's Liberation Armed Forces have also used intense anti-aircraft fire to seal off the base's airspace, continuously shooting down enemy aircraft, making it difficult for the U.S. invaders to rely on air transport. The People's Liberation Armed Forces have also been steadily tightening the noose around the enemy, cleverly annihilating enemy troops. On the 26th, a platoon of U.S. soldiers patrolling outside the base's barbed wire was ambushed by the People's Liberation Armed Forces, suffering heavy losses. Another platoon of U.S. reinforcements also suffered severe casualties.

On the afternoon of the 23rd, the People's Liberation Armed Forces heavily bombarded the U.S. Marine Corps at the Da Nang base and Hill 845 in the Khe Sanh area. The shells accurately hit the enemy command posts, communication centers, radar stations, and artillery positions in these two places, destroying many fortifications and bunkers. The radar station caught fire and burned. Nearby ammunition depots and many helicopters also exploded after being hit. The enemy's artillery positions in these two places were completely paralyzed, with many cannons and mortars destroyed. On the 25th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces destroyed another enemy ammunition depot in the Da Nang area.

On the 24th, the accurate artillery fire of the People's Liberation Armed Forces sank four enemy transport ships on the Vam Co River and two enemy ships docked at Dong Ha Pier. On the same day, they also shot down four enemy helicopters north of Vam Co.

On the 26th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously attacked the enemy's fuel depots, ammunition depots, and airfields in the Dong Ha area, causing the fuel depots to catch fire and the ammunition depots to explode. Many C-130 transport planes and helicopters were destroyed. On the same day, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also bombarded the Khe Sanh base and Hill 241, destroying many enemy bunkers and trenches, and destroying many military vehicles.

In the Mekong Delta, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in My Tho Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. invaders' base on the Fourth Highway early in the morning of the 25th, annihilating a U.S. camp.

Early in the morning of the 25th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the U.S. invaders' infantry, engineering, armored, and artillery units stationed on the Fourth Highway, which were attempting to reopen and repair the highway. After a fierce bombardment, the People's Liberation Armed Forces divided into multiple columns and charged into the enemy base, encircling and annihilating them. Preliminary reports indicate that after thirty minutes of intense fighting, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated a U.S. camp, destroying a large number of armored vehicles, engineering vehicles, and cannons, and seizing many weapons and military supplies.

At the same time, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also heavily bombarded the U.S. invaders' bases in Long Dien and Phuoc Long, paralyzing the enemy's artillery positions.

Previously, on the 22nd, the People's Liberation Armed Forces intercepted the enemy north of My Tho City, first annihilating the enemy's advance guard company, then repelling the enemy's various attacks, killing many enemy soldiers. Following this, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy base early in the morning of the 23rd, killing 200 enemy soldiers.
