	In the critical moment of rescuing my class brother, it was Chairman Mao who gave me strength. My experience is:
	With Mao Zedong Thought, one is the bravest.
		Certain Regiment Commander, Yang Deming

	Editor's Note: To lead with Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and carry out the ideological transformation of the people is the fundamental principle of our military construction. By grasping this fundamental principle, we can overcome any difficulty and defeat any enemy, completing the most arduous tasks assigned by the Party. The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing advocate "military first" and "technology first," opposing the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics, aiming to achieve their evil goal of usurping the Party, the military, and the country.

	Emphasizing politics or emphasizing military affairs is the focal point of the two-line struggle in our military. Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul. Military affairs must always be under the command of politics. We must firmly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide all actions.

	Representatives of the second session of the Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Conference of the Communication Troops criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev who opposed emphasizing politics. Their experiences once again proved: if ideological and political work is done well, training, production, construction, combat, internal unity, organizational discipline, and military-civilian relations can all be well managed. Above all, emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought is the most important. Leading with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out the ideological transformation of the people is the politics of politics, the soul of the soul, the core of the core. Comrades say well: no matter how the situation changes, emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics, and carrying out the ideological transformation of the people will never change.

	In the old society, I was a poor child. Generation after generation, we were oppressed and exploited by class enemies. It was Chairman Mao who saved millions of laboring people from the depths of misery, giving us happiness and light. Therefore, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, I eagerly study the works of Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I follow. I dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. Even sacrificing my life is nothing to me.

	When I heard the Chinese Khrushchev say that one should "protect one's life and health," I immediately realized that this is the philosophy of traitors and cowards. This counter-revolutionary revisionist, under the guise of "the interests of the Party and the revolution," is bowing down to the enemy and justifying his role as a shameful traitor. This is utterly shameless.

	On February 18, 1967, our company was conducting live grenade throwing practice. Soldier Liu Yingguo threw the grenade outside the cover, two meters away, and it was too late to pick it up and throw it again. Liu Yingguo's life was seriously threatened. At this critical moment, if one were to follow the Chinese Khrushchev's advice to "protect one's life and health," one would definitely run away. However, I thought of Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Concern for others is more important than concern for oneself," and immediately rushed forward, covering Liu Yingguo with my body. The grenade exploded, and dirt and stones fell all over me. Back in the barracks, I studied the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again, feeling particularly close to it. I was able to rescue my class brother in the critical moment, completely because Chairman Mao gave me the courage and strength.

	That afternoon, the live grenade throwing practice continued. When it was the turn of the new soldier Xiaoyan, it was already late. Due to his excessive force, large turning angle, and late release, the grenade fell on the inner slope of the cover. The smoking grenade rolled back, and in a few seconds, it would explode, seriously threatening the lives of the class brothers inside the cover. At this critical moment, I did not think of "loving oneself," but of Chairman Mao's great voice: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." The image of the hero Wang Yuchang appeared before my eyes. I took a quick step forward, pushed Xiaoyan to the ground, covered him with my body, and with my right hand, grabbed the hissing, smoking grenade, using all my strength to throw it out. There was a loud explosion, and the grenade exploded in the air. The comrades inside the cover all escaped safely. At this time, Xiaoyan, with tears of excitement, could not speak. I said to him: "This is what Chairman Mao taught me to do!" Xiaoyan, with infinite gratitude, said: "It is Chairman Mao who gave me a second life. I will read Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao to revolution for life!" The comrades shouted loudly: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!

	The process of rescuing comrades twice made me deeply realize that only by diligently studying Chairman Mao's works, changing one's worldview, and sparking a revolution in the depths of one's soul, fighting against the "self" and establishing the "public," firmly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of survival, and taking heroes as examples, can one stand out in times of need for the Party and the people, and in critical moments, remain calm and fearless.

    我在生死关头抢救阶级兄弟，完全是毛主席给了我力量。我的体会是：
    有了毛泽东思想就最勇敢
    某部连长　杨德明
    编者按：用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化，是我军建设的根本。抓住这个根本，我们就能克服任何困难，战胜任何敌人，完成党交给我们的最艰巨的任务。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹“军事第一”、“技术第一”，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，反对突出无产阶级政治，是妄图达到他们篡党篡军篡国的罪恶目的。
    突出政治，还是突出军事，这是我军两条路线斗争的焦点。毛主席教导我们说，政治是统帅，是灵魂。军事必须永远在政治统帅之下。我们要坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的路，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导一切行动。
    通信兵第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的部分代表，用他们的实践经验，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫反对突出政治的谬论。他们的经验又一次证明：思想政治工作做好了，训练、生产、施工、作战、内部团结、组织纪律、军民关系，都可以搞得好。千重要，万重要，突出毛泽东思想最重要。以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。同志们说得好：情况千变万变，突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化永远不能变。
    在旧社会，我是一个穷孩子，祖祖辈辈都受着阶级敌人的压迫和剥削。是毛主席他老人家把千千万万劳动人民从水深火热中拯救出来，使我们得到幸福和光明。所以，我怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。凡是伟大领袖毛主席所讲的，我就照着去做，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，就是牺牲自己的生命，也在所不惜。
    当我听到中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么要“保护自己的生命与健康”时，立即意识到这是叛徒和怕死鬼的“哲学”。这个反革命修正主义分子挂着“党和革命的利益”的牌子，为他和他的同伙向敌人屈膝投降，为充当可耻的叛徒作辩护，真是无耻透顶。
    一九六七年二月十八日，我们连队进行手榴弹实弹投掷。战士刘英国将手榴弹扔在掩体外两米远的地方，要拾起来再扔出去已经来不及了。刘英国同志的生命受到严重的威胁。在这危急的时刻，如果象中国赫鲁晓夫说的要“保护自己的生命与健康”，就一定会往后跑。但是，我想到毛主席的“关心他人比关心自己为重”的伟大教导，立即扑上前去，伏在刘英国同志身上。手榴弹爆炸了，黄土、石块落了我满身。回到营房，我再一次学习《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作，感到格外亲切。我能够在生死关头抢救阶级兄弟，完全是毛主席给了我勇气和力量。
    当天下午，继续进行实弹投掷训练。当轮到新战士小阎投掷时，天色已晚。由于他用力过猛，转体角度过大，出手过晚，手榴弹落在掩体内坡上。冒着烟的手榴弹，直往回滚，只要再过几秒钟，就要爆炸，掩体内阶级兄弟的生命受到严重威胁。在这千钧一发的时刻，我想的不是什么“钟爱自己”，而是毛主席的伟大声音：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。王裕昌同志的英雄形象，呈现在我的眼前。我一个箭步抢过去，将小阎按倒在地，一面用身体掩护着他，一面用右手抓起咝咝冒烟的手榴弹，用尽全身的力气，投了出去。只听轰的一声，手榴弹在空中爆炸了，掩体内同志们都安全脱险。这时，小阎同志含着激动的泪花，说不出话来。我对他说：“这是毛主席他老人家教导我这样做的啊！”小阎无限感激地说：“是毛主席给了我第二次生命，我一定要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席干革命。”同志们一个劲地高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    两次抢救战友的过程，使我深深地体会到，只有刻苦地学习毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观，在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，坚决批判中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学，处处以英雄人物为榜样，才能在党和人民需要自己的时候，在生死关头挺身而出，做到脸不变色，心不跳。
