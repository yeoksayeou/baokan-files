In the face of the financial crisis sweeping the capitalist world, the entire capitalist monetary system is accelerating towards collapse. The "gold reserve" is virtually defunct, and the price of gold in the "free market" is soaring further, leading to a significant devaluation of the dollar.

New China News Agency, March 18th: Under the current financial crisis sweeping the entire capitalist world, the heavily struck U.S. imperialism hastily convened a meeting of the heads of major capitalist countries' financial capital on March 16th in Washington, D.C., to discuss emergency measures. The communiqué issued after the meeting indicates that the "gold reserve" used to support the dollar's position has effectively collapsed, which in turn means the devaluation of the dollar; the capitalist monetary system centered around the dollar is accelerating towards complete collapse.

This meeting was held after the Johnson administration announced a series of "emergency" measures in a flurry on the evening of March 14th. Participants in this meeting included the central bank governors of the "gold reserve" member countries such as Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United States, as well as the executive directors of the "International Monetary Fund" and the "Bank for International Settlements," which serve U.S. economic expansion policies. The communiqué issued after the meeting announced that henceforth, the gold in the reserve will only be supplied for transactions between the central banks of capitalist countries and will no longer be supplied to the so-called "free market" for gold. This means that from now on, there will be two prices for gold: one is the price of 35 dollars per ounce of gold for transactions between the central banks of capitalist countries, while in the so-called "free market," the price of gold will be allowed to rise.

The establishment of the "gold reserve" was originally a measure taken by the United States, when its gold reserves were dwindling and it could no longer single-handedly support the dollar's position, to use the gold of other capitalist countries to meet the demand for gold in the so-called "free market" and stabilize the gold-dollar exchange rate. Now that it has been decided not to supply gold to the so-called "free market," this "gold reserve" is effectively defunct; in the current strong wave of gold buying, the market price of gold has long surpassed the official price of 35 dollars per ounce, and this decision, once announced, will inevitably lead to a further surge in the price of gold in the so-called "free market," which in turn means a significant devaluation of the dollar.

The United States and other member countries of the reserve were forced to take such a measure in an attempt to delay the danger of the "dike" breaking in U.S. fiscal, financial, and the entire capitalist world's monetary system. However, some financial experts in capitalist countries generally believe that the result may be counterproductive. French President de Gaulle's economic advisor Rueff believes that allowing the price of gold to "freely" rise in the "free market" is "equivalent to the real devaluation of the dollar. The result is that the entire exchange system of major Western currencies is in question, which could seriously disrupt international trade in the capitalist world and thus disrupt the economic activities of various countries." The *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* points out, "The collapse of the 'gold reserve,' the emergence of two prices for gold, 'the foreign exchange market may therefore become chaotic,' 'the result may be a rise in the price of gold, which in turn may become a measure to strike at the world economy [of the capitalist world]."

To gain the support of other member countries of the reserve for such an emergency measure, the United States agreed to adopt a series of "austerity" measures, including cutting expenditures and increasing taxes, to "improve the U.S. balance of payments." However, the expenses for the Vietnam War are enormous, and as the war continues to "escalate," this part of the expenses will only increase. The so-called "austerity" measures can only mean further attacks on the broad masses of the American people. Such ruthless attacks on the people will inevitably intensify class contradictions within the United States. It is particularly noteworthy that since last year, the U.S. economic situation has been increasingly stagnant. In such a situation, implementing "austerity" measures will inevitably accelerate the arrival of the crisis of overproduction, leading to the co-occurrence of financial crisis and economic crisis. Therefore, the measures currently taken by the U.S. ruling class are essentially "drinking poison to quench thirst."

　　在席卷资本主义世界的金融危机的猛烈打击下
　　整个资本主义货币体系加速走向崩溃
　　“黄金总库”名存实亡，“自由市场”黄金价格进一步暴涨，美元实际上大大贬值
    新华社十八日讯　在当前席卷整个资本主义世界的金融危机的袭击下，受到沉重打击的美帝国主义十六日匆匆召集其它主要资本主义国家金融资本的头目，在华盛顿举行了两天的“紧急会议”，商讨应急措施。会后发表的公报表明，用以支持美元地位的“黄金总库”，已经在实际上宣告完蛋，这实际上也就等于美元的贬值；以美元为主体的资本主义货币体系正加速走向彻底崩溃。
    这次会议是在约翰逊政府十四日晚间手忙脚乱地宣布采取一系列“抢险”措施之后召开的。参加这次会议的有英国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时、瑞士和美国等“黄金总库”成员国的中央银行行长，以及为美国的经济扩张政策服务的“国际货币基金组织”和“国际清算银行”的执行理事。会后发表的公报宣布，今后，金库成员国的黄金，只供应各资本主义国家中央银行之间的交易，而不再象过去那样供应所谓黄金“自由市场”上的需求。这意味着，今后，黄金将出现两种价格：一种是各资本主义国家中央银行之间，仍按目前的三十五美元一盎司黄金的价格进行交易；而在所谓“自由市场”上则听任黄金涨价。
      “黄金总库”的成立，本来是美国在它的黄金储备日益枯竭、无力单独支持美元地位的情况下，利用其它一些资本主义国家的黄金来应付所谓“自由市场”上对黄金的需求、稳定黄金—美元比价的一种措施，现在既然决定不再向所谓“自由市场”供应黄金，这个“黄金总库”也就名存实亡了；在目前这股强烈的抢购黄金风潮中，市场上的黄金价格本来早已大大突破了三十五美元一盎司的官方牌价，这个决定一经宣布，所谓“自由市场”上的黄金价格势必进一步暴涨，而这实际上就等于美元的大大贬值。
    美国和金库其它成员国被迫采取这样一种措施，本来是企图拖延美国财政、金融以及整个资本主义世界金融货币体系“决堤”的危险，但是一些资本主义国家金融界人士普遍认为，结果可能是适得其反。法国总统戴高乐的经济顾问吕埃夫认为，让金价在“自由市场”上“自由”涨价，“等于是美元的真正贬值。其结果，使得西方主要货币的整个兑换制度成了问题，这就可能严重地打乱（资本主义世界）国际贸易，因而也就打乱各国的经济活动。”《日本经济新闻》指出，“黄金总库”垮台，黄金将出现两种价格，“外汇市场可能因此发生混乱”，“结果会迫使黄金价格上涨，回过头来看，这可能成为打击（资本主义）世界经济的措施”。
    美国为了争取金库其它成员国支持这样一个应急措施，答应要采取包括削减开支、增税在内的一系列“紧缩”措施，来“改善美国的国际收支”。但是，侵越战争开支浩大，而且随着战争的不断“升级”，这部分开支将越来越大，所谓“紧缩”措施，就只能是向美国广大劳动人民进一步开刀。这种对劳动人民的猖狂进攻势必加剧美国国内的阶级矛盾。特别应该指出的是，去年以来美国经济状况日趋呆滞，在这样的情况下实行“紧缩”，势必将加速生产过剩危机的到来，导致金融危机和经济危机的并发。因此，美国统治集团目前采取的这些措施，实际上是“饮鸩止渴”。
