In the spring breeze that sweeps across the nation, as the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another bright red flag has been raised on the eastern coast of our motherland, by the Qiantang River: the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born!

Follow Chairman Mao and you will achieve victory! At every critical moment in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province, it was the radiant Mao Zedong Thought that illuminated the path forward, and it was under the personal care and timely guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. Especially last year, when Chairman Mao personally visited Zhejiang to inspect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this was the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, and the greatest spur for the people and soldiers of Zhejiang. The establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the series of most recent instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

We extend our warmest congratulations to the 31 million revolutionary people of Zhejiang Province, and to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang who have made tremendous contributions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

China's Khrushchev and his handful of agents in Zhejiang have brazenly opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely resisted the promotion of proletarian politics, and pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Using the tactics of counter-revolutionary two-facedness, they engaged in conspiratorial activities, attempting to restore capitalism in Zhejiang. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the full support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcame interference from the right and the ultra-left, and engaged in a tenacious struggle. They finally smashed the sabotage of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, exposed their conspiracies and tricks, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of Zhejiang and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the broad leftist masses," and to "believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army," and to "love and support the soldiers." They have executed Chairman Mao's series of most recent instructions. The broad soldiers and officers of the three services stationed in Zhejiang have clearly executed and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, implementing the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions." They have used Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad leftist masses. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province have firmly believed in and relied on the great People's Liberation Army, taking the People's Liberation Army as their model for learning, and enthusiastically helping the army to do a good job in the "three supports" and "two militaries." The solidarity between the military and the people of Zhejiang, based on the great principles of Mao Zedong Thought, has powerfully promoted the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution throughout the province. Like the spring tides of the Qiantang River, wave after wave surges forward, surging and advancing.

After the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it must firmly emphasize proletarian politics, firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, mobilize the masses, and deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle. It must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, expose and denounce the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Zhejiang, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

Zhejiang is on the front line of coastal defense, where class struggle is sharp and complex. The entire province's military and civilian population must strengthen their ironclad revolutionary unity, heighten their vigilance, strengthen their awareness of the enemy, and prevent a handful of traitors, American and KMT spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist roaders from sowing discord. They must resolutely smash all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities by the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and firmly fight against any actions that damage military-civilian unity and the reputation of the People's Liberation Army. They must fortify the great red wall. They must strengthen preparedness for war, guard the coastal defenses, and be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs, annihilate all invaders, defend our great motherland, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee marks the beginning of a new phase of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province. We believe that the revolutionary people of Zhejiang and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang will surely raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, vigorously establish various levels and types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of most recent instructions. All revolutionary cadres and masses must firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, take "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, oppose factionalism and sectarianism, continue to enhance proletarian party spirit, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, criticize anarchism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. They must further implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," and "save money to make revolution," and do a better job in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of work.

To seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization, we must firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance bravely! Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of Zhejiang!

    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    ——热烈庆贺浙江省革命委员会诞生
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在春风吹遍全国，亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，祖国的东海之滨，钱塘江畔，又树起一面鲜艳的红旗：浙江省革命委员会光荣诞生了！
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利！浙江省无产阶级文化大革命运动胜利发展的每一个关键时刻，都是光芒四射的毛泽东思想照亮了前进的道路，都受到了我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的亲切关怀和及时指导。特别是去年毛主席亲临浙江，视察无产阶级文化大革命，这是对浙江军民最大的鼓舞，最大的教育，最大的鞭策。浙江省革命委员会的成立，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    我们谨向浙江省三千一百万革命人民，向在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了巨大贡献的中国人民解放军驻浙陆海空三军指战员，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在浙江的一小撮代理人，猖狂地对抗伟大的毛泽东思想，极力地反对突出无产阶级政治，推行反革命修正主义路线，他们采用反革命两面派的手段，进行阴谋活动，妄图在浙江复辟资本主义。用毛泽东思想武装起来的浙江省无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军驻浙部队的全力支持下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，终于粉碎了党内一小撮走资派的破坏，揭穿了他们的阴谋诡计，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    浙江无产阶级革命派和人民解放军驻浙部队，坚决响应毛主席发出的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，革命群众要“相信和依靠人民解放军”，“要拥军爱民”的伟大战斗号召，执行了毛主席的一系列最新指示。驻浙三军广大指战员旗帜鲜明地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，贯彻执行“支左不支派”的原则，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众。浙江省无产阶级革命派，坚决相信和依靠伟大的人民解放军，把人民解放军作为自己学习的榜样，热情帮助解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作。浙江军民在伟大毛泽东思想原则基础上的坚强团结，有力地推动了全省的革命的大联合和革命的三结合，有如钱江春潮，一浪高过一浪，汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    浙江省革命委员会成立以后，要坚定地突出无产阶级政治，坚定地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，放手发动群众，深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在浙江的代理人，揭透批臭，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍各个阵地。
    浙江地处海防前线，阶级斗争尖锐复杂。全省军民要大力加强钢铁般的革命团结，百倍提高警惕，加强敌情观念，严防一小撮叛徒、美蒋特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派挑拨离间，坚决粉碎没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右的一切反革命破坏活动，同破坏军民团结、损害人民解放军声誉的行为作坚决的斗争，巩固伟大的红色长城。要加强战备，严守海防，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅，消灭一切敢于来犯之敌，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    浙江省革命委员会的建立，标志着浙江省无产阶级文化大革命运动进入了一个新的战斗航程。我们相信，浙江革命人民和人民解放军驻浙部队一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力办好各级、各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。广大革命干部和革命群众要坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，以“斗私，批修”为纲，反对山头主义和宗派主义，继续增强无产阶级党性，坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，批判无政府主义，做好各单位的斗批改。要进一步执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，“要节约闹革命”的方针，把工农业生产和各方面的工作做得更好。
    为了从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，我们要坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，奋勇前进！让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在浙江上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
