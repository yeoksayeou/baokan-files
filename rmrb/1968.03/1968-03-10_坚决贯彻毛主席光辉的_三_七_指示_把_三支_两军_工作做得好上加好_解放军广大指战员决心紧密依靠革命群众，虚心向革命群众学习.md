Resolutely Implement Chairman Mao's Brilliant "March 7" Directive
Do an Excellent Job in the "Three Supports, Two Military" Work
The Broad Masses of PLA Soldiers and Officers Are Determined to Rely Closely on Revolutionary Masses and Humblely Learn from Them

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, the great strategist Chairman Mao's famous "March 7" directive on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was issued one year ago and reissued, has greatly inspired the PLA soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" work. With profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, they immediately launched a campaign of extensive study, propaganda, summary, and implementation. In recent days, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have held study sessions, discussion meetings, and experience-sharing meetings, repeatedly reviewing Chairman Mao's great directive: "The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for colleges, middle schools, and high-grade elementary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself, and do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes during military training. Except for the elderly and the sick, these people should be allowed to participate to facilitate their reform. All of these can be solved if done seriously." They are determined to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, do an excellent job in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, and together with the revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In Beijing, the PLA soldiers and officers executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks on various fronts, together with the broad revolutionary masses, reviewed and summarized the situation and experience of implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives over the past year. The soldiers and officers executing military training tasks at Beijing No. 40 Middle School pointed out: Leading with Mao Zedong Thought, setting high standards, and strictly demanding the thought revolutionization of the military training team, revolutionary committee members, and the broad revolutionary teachers and students is the fundamental way to implement the "March 7" directive. They, together with the school revolutionary committee, jointly decided to use teaching classes as units to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply study Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives, deeply carry out the educational revolution, and raise the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the military training personnel, revolutionary committee members, and all revolutionary teachers and students.

The support-left personnel of the PLA 8341 Unit stationed at Beijing Knitting General Factory specially held a meeting and proposed four measures to further implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives: First, lead with Mao Zedong Thought, strictly demand the thought revolutionization of the support-left personnel, guard against arrogance, and humbly learn from the revolutionary cadres, reforming the objective world while reforming the subjective world; second, firmly implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, further mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to overthrow bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, enhance proletarian party spirit, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite the majority of cadres and masses, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, further deepen the revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation; third, strictly demand the thought revolutionization and organizational revolutionization of the factory revolutionary committee, actively support and enthusiastically help the factory revolutionary committee improve its leadership style, and establish proletarian revolutionary authority; fourth, extensively hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, promote a revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, break down the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public," and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in the revolutionary ranks to the proletarian revolutionary track with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

In Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Jinan, and other places, the broad masses of PLA soldiers and officers executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks also extensively carried out activities to study, propagate, and further implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives. The PLA Shanghai Garrison Party Committee held an expanded meeting to discuss measures to further implement this great directive. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of the PLA stationed in many factories, institutions, and schools in Guangzhou conducted extensive propaganda activities among the broad revolutionary masses. Some propaganda teams, together with the revolutionary masses, discussed and formulated measures and plans to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units.

In the process of studying and discussing, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have a deeper understanding that to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives and do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, they must closely rely on the broad revolutionary masses and humbly learn from the revolutionary masses.
