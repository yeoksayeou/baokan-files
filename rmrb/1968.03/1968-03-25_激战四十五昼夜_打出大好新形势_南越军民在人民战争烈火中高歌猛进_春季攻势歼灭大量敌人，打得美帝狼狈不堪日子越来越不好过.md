In the spring offensive, the Vietnamese people in the South, fighting fiercely for 45 days and nights, have achieved an unprecedentedly excellent new situation in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. The flames of people's war are blazing across the enemy-occupied countryside and towns in South Vietnam. The American imperialists and their lackeys are surrounded by enemies on all sides and are in a state of chaos.

In the 45 days up to March 15, the people of South Vietnam, in the countryside, cities, mountains, and plains, have struck heavy blows at the enemy everywhere, achieving the glorious result of annihilating more than 150,000 enemy troops (including 45,000 American and mercenary troops). In the first wave of attacks from January 29 to February 4, they annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops and dissolved 200,000 puppet troops, achieving the world-shaking Tet Offensive. Subsequently, in the 40 days from February 5 to March 15, they continued their efforts and annihilated nearly 100,000 enemy troops. After the first wave of attacks during the Tet Offensive, in mid-February and early March, they launched two more waves of attacks, mainly using artillery, and continuously harassed the enemy with many small-scale attacks. The fierce spring offensive of the people of South Vietnam has left the American and puppet troops in a state of panic, unable to defend themselves.

The brilliant victories of the spring battles demonstrate that the long-term people's war in South Vietnam has reached a highly developed stage. In recent years, the people of South Vietnam have annihilated an increasing number of enemy troops. The glorious result of annihilating 150,000 enemy troops in the spring of this year exceeds the total number of enemy troops annihilated in the entire dry season from winter 1965 to spring 1966 and is close to half of the total number of enemy troops annihilated in 1967. In the Tet Offensive, which is characterized by the combination of military and civilian forces, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, not only the army fought, but also millions of civilians participated extensively. The people of South Vietnam not only struck at the enemy in the occupied countryside but also attacked hundreds of enemy strongholds in cities, annihilating a large number of enemy troops and destroying a large amount of enemy military supplies; they not only launched a powerful military offensive but also combined it with a powerful political offensive; they not only used flexible and mobile strategies and tactics but also demonstrated high organizational and disciplinary qualities. The heroic people of South Vietnam have been tempered and grown stronger in the fires of war.

The great victories of the people of South Vietnam in the spring once again indisputably prove that people's war is the most effective weapon against American imperialism and its lackeys. The people of South Vietnam, with their magnificent spring offensive, mobilized and organized millions of urban and rural people in South Vietnam to join the People's Liberation Army in a battle of encirclement and annihilation of the enemy. The powerful Tet Offensive blew the trumpet for the magnificent spring battles. In the Tet Offensive, wherever the liberation forces went, thousands upon thousands of farmers, workers, students, and other laborers, even Buddhist monks, rose up in arms, turning their long-suppressed hatred of the American invaders and the puppet regime into a surging anti-American tide. They took up arms and fought side by side with the liberation soldiers, hunted down thugs, and overthrew the puppet government. They established various revolutionary and patriotic organizations and launched massive propaganda activities. The people's self-defense forces and other patriotic armed organizations active in various urban districts have achieved outstanding feats, becoming a strong force in supporting the liberation army's operations. Among the people, many moving stories emerged: a women's self-defense unit annihilated 120 American soldiers, a brave old woman led the liberation army to capture an American colonel, and female armed forces members remained steadfast in the face of enemy torture. The power of 14 million people of South Vietnam united to annihilate the enemy has made the enemy tremble with fear. The American and puppet troops are deeply mired in the vast sea of the people's war in South Vietnam, facing imminent destruction. The great victories of the people of South Vietnam in the spring once again vividly prove the wise judgment made by the great leader Chairman Mao 30 years ago: "The people are the decisive factor in victory."

The great victories achieved in the spring offensive have become a vivid example of the people of South Vietnam successfully waging people's war in enemy-occupied cities. In a few days during the Tet Offensive, the people of South Vietnam simultaneously set the flames of people's war ablaze in hundreds of enemy-occupied cities and their surrounding military bases, catching the enemy off guard. With the close cooperation of the people, the striking forces of the people's armed forces, like sharp arrows, penetrated the enemy's heart and roamed freely. In the heavily guarded city of Saigon, they fought in all nine districts, leaving the enemy in chaos. In the northern city of Hue, they fought street by street and house by house, repelling dozens of desperate counterattacks by American and puppet troops, holding out for more than 20 days and nights, and achieving the glorious result of annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops. In many key cities in the Mekong Delta, they quickly swept away almost all the American and puppet military and political institutions, destroying a large amount of military supplies. The large number of troops that the enemy used to defend the cities and that were called in from the surrounding areas to deal with the crisis were annihilated and dissolved in the spring offensive. The invading American authorities in Vietnam had to admit that in various cities, "American lives have paid a heavy price."

Because the people of South Vietnam, while attacking enemy strongholds in cities and countryside, launched fierce attacks on American military bases, these bases were engulfed in flames, seriously destroying the enemy's ability to quickly mobilize and their war supplies, including more than 1,800 aircraft and 1,300 tanks and armored vehicles, thus creating favorable conditions for extensive annihilation activities in the cities.

The brilliant victories of the spring demonstrate that American imperialism is more fragile and less capable of withstanding attacks than any imperialism in history. The recent dismissal of the defeated American commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, exposed the desperate situation of the American imperialists after suffering a heavy defeat this spring. The spring offensive of the people of South Vietnam has left the American and puppet clique in a state of chaos, suffering heavy losses. The American invaders are in an increasingly passive and chaotic strategic situation. Western news agencies lament that Johnson is "faced with difficult choices": whether to "defend" the countryside or "defend" the cities. The American imperialists, with insufficient troops and besieged from within and without, have suffered a heavy defeat in South Vietnam this spring, and their days are getting worse.

As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The brilliant achievements of the people of South Vietnam in the spring once again prove this great truth. No matter how desperately the American imperialists struggle, they cannot save themselves from complete defeat in Vietnam. The final victory will certainly belong to the 31 million Vietnamese people who are determined to fight to the end.

    激战四十五昼夜　打出大好新形势
    南越军民在人民战争烈火中高歌猛进
    春季攻势歼灭大量敌人，打得美帝狼狈不堪日子越来越不好过
    据新华社二十四日讯　本社记者述评：在春季激战中高歌猛进的越南南方军民，经过了四十五个昼夜的浴血奋战，打出了抗美救国战争空前大好的新形势。人民战争的熊熊烈火，燃遍南越的敌占农村和城镇。美帝国主义及其走狗腹背受敌，四面楚歌。
    在截至三月十五日的四十五天中，在南越农村和城市、山区和平原，南越军民到处给敌人以沉重的打击，取得了歼灭美伪军十五万多名（其中包括美军和帮凶军四万五千名）的辉煌战果。在一月二十九日夜间到二月四日的第一次全面出击中，他们一举歼敌五万多，瓦解伪军二十万，取得了震惊世界的新春大捷。随后，在二月五日到三月十五日的四十天中，他们再接再厉，又歼灭敌军近十万人。在新春第一次全面出击之后，在二月中旬和三月初，他们又两次发动了以炮击为主的全面袭击，并不断地以许多小规模的进攻困扰敌人。南越军民春季的凌厉攻势，打得美伪军到处“告急”，无法招架。
    春季战斗的光辉胜利表明，长期进行的南越人民战争已经发展到了一个高度水平。几年来，南越军民歼灭敌人的有生力量越来越多。今春四十五天歼敌十五万的辉煌战果，超过了一九六五年冬——一九六六年春整个旱季歼敌数量的总和，接近于一九六七年全年歼敌总数的一半。在具有军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合的鲜明特点的新春攻势中，不仅军队打仗，而且有千百万民众的广泛配合。南越军民不仅打击敌占农村之敌，而且痛捣数以百计的城镇敌巢，不仅歼灭了大量敌人有生力量，而且摧毁了敌人大量军事物资；不仅开展了强大的军事攻势，而且配合以强大的政治攻势；不仅运用了机动灵活的战略战术，而且表现了高度的组织性和纪律性。英雄的南越军民在战火中不断地得到了锻炼和成长，越战越强。
    南越军民春季的伟大胜利，又一次无可辩驳地证明：人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。南越军民气魄雄伟的春季攻势，动员和组织了南越城乡千百万群众，同解放军一道，投入了一场围歼敌人的战斗。声势浩大的新春攻势，吹响了轰轰烈烈的春季战斗的进军号角。在新春攻势中，解放武装力量所到之处，成千上万的农民、工人、学生和其他劳动人民，甚至佛教僧侣，纷纷揭竿而起，把蕴积已久的对美国侵略者和卖国傀儡集团的仇恨，化成了一股汹涌澎湃的反美怒潮。他们拿起刀枪，和解放军战士并肩作战，追捕恶棍，推翻伪政权。他们成立了各种革命和爱国组织，开展了声势浩大的宣传活动。活跃在各个城市街区的人民自卫队和其它爱国的人民武装组织，建立了出色的战功，成为配合解放军作战的坚强力量。在人民中间涌现了许多可歌可泣的事迹：一支女自卫队痛歼美军一百二十名、英勇的老大娘带领解放军活捉了美军上校、女武装队员在敌人严刑面前坚贞不屈，……。一千四百万南越军民团结歼敌的威力，使敌人胆战心惊。美伪军深陷南越人民战争的汪洋大海之中，面临灭顶之灾。南越军民春季的伟大胜利，又一次生动地证明了伟大导师毛主席早在三十年前作出的英明的论断：“兵民是胜利之本”。
    在春季攻势中所取得的新春大捷，成为南越军民在敌占城镇里胜利开展人民战争的一个生动战例。在新春的几天之内，南越军民把人民战争的烈火同时燃向数以百计的敌占城镇及其周围的敌军基地，打得敌人措手不及。在人民的紧密配合下，人民武装的突击部队，象利箭般插进敌人的心脏，在敌巢里纵横驰骋。在敌人重兵把守的西贡市内，他们打遍了全市的九个街区，打得敌人乱成一团。在北部重镇顺化，他们逐街逐屋同敌人进行激战，击溃美伪军几十次疯狂反扑，坚持了二十多个昼夜，取得了歼灭敌人一万多名的辉煌战果。在湄公河三角洲的许多重镇，他们短时间内横扫了几乎全部美伪军政机构，摧毁了大批军用物资。敌人用来防守城镇和为应付危局而从城市周围调来增援的大批兵力，在新春作战中遭到歼灭和瓦解。侵越美军当局也不得不承认，在各城镇，“美军生命付出了重大代价”。
    由于南越军民在袭击城乡敌巢的同时，猛袭美军基地，使这些基地陷入了一片火海之中，严重地摧毁了敌人迅速机动的能力和战争物资，其中包括一千八百多架飞机和一千三百多辆坦克和装甲车，从而为在城镇里广泛开展歼敌活动创造了有利的条件。
    春季的辉煌胜利表明，美帝国主义比历史上所有的帝国主义都更加脆弱，更加不经打。侵越美军败将威斯特摩兰最近被撤职，正好暴露了美帝在今春遭到惨败后所面临的狼狈处境。南越军民的春季攻势，打得美伪集团损兵折将，完全乱了阵脚。美国侵略者在战略上陷入了愈加被动和混乱的窘境。西方通讯社哀叹，约翰逊被“置于困难的选择面前”：侵越美军是“守卫”乡村呢，还是“守卫”城市。兵力不足、内外交困的美帝国主义，今春在南越战场上遭到惨重失败后，日子更是越来越不好过。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”南越军民的春季辉煌战果又一次证明了这个伟大的真理。不管贼心不死的美帝国主义今后怎样垂死挣扎，都无法挽救它在越南彻底失败的命运。最后胜利一定属于三千一百万下定决心打到底的越南人民。
