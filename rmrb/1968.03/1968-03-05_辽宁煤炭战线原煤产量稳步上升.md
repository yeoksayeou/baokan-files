The revolutionary workers and cadres on the coal front in Liaoning Province, with deep affection for our great leader Chairman Mao, have been thoroughly implementing and fully carrying out Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. The pace of revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones in various coal mines has been significantly accelerated, and coal production levels have been steadily rising. Since February, the daily coal production level has been higher each decade. The Xinchun Open-pit Mine, Gaode Mine, Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, and the Niuxintai Mine, Tian Shifu Mine, and Benxi Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau have all completed their February state coal production plans ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them.

    辽宁煤炭战线原煤产量稳步上升
    辽宁省煤炭战线上的广大革命职工和革命干部，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，各煤矿革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐大大加快，煤炭生产水平稳步上升。二月份以来，原煤日产水平一旬高过一旬。阜新矿务局的新邱露天矿、高德矿、平安矿和本溪矿务局的牛心台矿、田师傅矿、本溪矿等六个煤矿，提前超额完成了二月份的国家原煤生产计划。
