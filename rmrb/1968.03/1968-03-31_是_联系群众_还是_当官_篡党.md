To Link with the Masses or to Seek Official Positions and Usurp the Party

Former Volunteer Army First-Class War Hero, Deputy Regiment Chief of Staff, Mao Guosheng

Standing consistently on the reactionary bourgeois stance, the Chinese Khrushchev has, to realize his personal ambition of usurping the Party, deliberately distorted Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses, secretly inserting bourgeois extreme individualism. In various settings, he has openly stated: "If you have good relations with the masses, you can become a township, county, or provincial cadre, and even go to the Central Committee, depending on your own abilities." "Going to the company to be a soldier can lead to becoming a platoon leader, company commander, or regiment commander..." The Chinese Khrushchev's spreading of these fallacies is extremely malicious.

Chairman Mao said: "We Communists are not seeking official positions, but are seeking revolution." We Communists go to the masses to better serve the revolution.

During the arduous years of war, to defeat the enemy, our cadres and soldiers lived and fought together, sharing joys and sorrows, like brothers. In peacetime, we sat with the soldiers, chatting intimately, carrying their guns and bedding, helping them with washing feet, mending shoes, and darning socks. On the battlefield, cadres led the charge and were the last to retreat, willing to sacrifice themselves to protect the soldiers. A common revolutionary goal forged an unbreakable class bond, uniting us to defeat the powerful enemy and win the war.

In the socialist revolution and construction, we further carried forward our Party's glorious tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses. This year, I and several comrades went to the Jinxi Cement Factory to support the leftists. To better fulfill this glorious mission, we have consistently practiced the "five together" with the workers: studying Chairman Mao's works together, struggling against and criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, eating, living, and working together. Through these "five together," we effectively tempered and transformed ourselves, promoting our ideological revolutionization.

Long-term revolutionary practice has made me increasingly aware that the purpose of linking with the masses is to transform ourselves and better serve the revolution. To achieve this goal, we must do the following three things: wholeheartedly serve the masses, diligently work as servants of the people; temper and transform ourselves in the fiery struggles of the masses, humbly and sincerely be students of the people; widely propagate Chairman Mao's instructions, the Party's line, principles, and policies, implement them with the masses, and listen to the masses' opinions, promptly reflecting them to the Party, conscientiously serving as a liaison between the Party and the people.

Comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with my own practice over the past twenty-plus years, and then looking at the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies, the issue becomes clearer. The "linking with the masses" and "having good relations with the masses" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about are merely using the people as stepping stones to climb up, treating "linking with the masses" as a shortcut to official positions, and a means to realize his ambition of usurping the Party. "Linking with the masses" is a pretense; seeking official positions and usurping the Party is the real goal. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's words, the result will inevitably be that our Party becomes a revisionist Party that betrays the revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev's intentions are indeed treacherous and malicious!

Chairman Mao teaches us:

"...Maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly establish the ideology of serving the people wholeheartedly, continue to maintain and carry forward our Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, and persist in going among the people, experiencing the storms and scenes of the people's struggles, humbly learning from the people, and tempering and transforming ourselves into true, strong fighters of the proletariat.

### 是“联系群众”还是“当官”“篡党”

    是“联系群众”还是“当官”“篡党”
    前志愿军一级战斗英雄、团副参谋长　毛国臣
    一贯站在资产阶级反动立场上的中国赫鲁晓夫，为了实现其篡党的个人野心，极力歪曲毛主席关于密切联系群众的教导，从这里偷偷塞进资产阶级极端个人主义的黑货。他在几种场合都直言不讳地说：“跟群众关系搞好了，……就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央，那就看个人的本事了。”“下连当兵将来会当连长、营长、团长……”。中国赫鲁晓夫散布这些谬论，用心是十分恶毒的。
    毛主席说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。我们共产党员，就是为了更好地革命才去联系群众的。
    在艰苦的战争年代里，为了战胜敌人，我们干部和战士生活在一起，战斗在一起，同甘共苦，亲如手足。平时，跟战士促膝谈心，替战士扛枪、背被包，帮战士打洗脚水，缝鞋补袜子。在战场上，干部冲锋在前，撤退在后，宁肯牺牲自己，也要设法保护战士。共同的革命目标，使我们建立了无比深厚的阶级感情，紧紧团结在一起，打败了强大的敌人，赢得了战争的胜利。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，我们进一步发扬了我们党密切联系群众的光荣传统。今年，我和几个同志到锦西水泥厂支左。为了更好地完成这一光荣任务，我们一直坚持了同工人“五同”：同学习毛主席著作、同斗批党内一小撮走资派、同吃、同住、同劳动。通过“五同”，有效地锻炼改造了自己，促进了自己的思想革命化。
    长期的革命实践，使我越来越深刻地认识到，联系群众的目的就是为了改造自己，更好地革命。要达到这个目的，必须做好以下三点：全心全意地为群众服务，勤勤恳恳地当好人民群众的勤务员；在火热的群众斗争中锻炼改造自己，虚心诚恳地当好人民群众的小学生；广泛宣传毛主席的指示，宣传党的路线、方针和政策，同群众一起贯彻执行，并且倾听群众的意见，及时向党反映，兢兢业业地当好党和人民群众之间的“联络员”。
    对照毛主席的教导，回忆二十多年来自己的实践，再来看看中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，问题就更清楚了。中国赫鲁晓夫所说的要“联系群众”，“跟群众搞好关系”，只不过是把人民群众当作向上爬的垫脚石，把“联系群众”当作升官的捷径，当作实现他篡党野心的手段。“联系群众”是假，当官、篡党是真。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫讲的去做，其结果必然是使我们党成为背叛革命的修正主义的党。中国赫鲁晓夫的用心，实在太阴险毒辣了！
    毛主席教导我们说：
  “……同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，继续保持和发扬我们党密切联系群众的优良作风，坚持深入到人民群众之中去，经群众斗争的风雨，见群众斗争的世面，虚心向人民群众学习，把自己锻炼改造成为一个真正的无产阶级的坚强战士。
