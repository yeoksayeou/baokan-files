Rely on Mao Zedong Thought to Solve Problems

Certain warehouse dormitory squad leader Lang Fanglin

In all work, should we emphasize business and technology, or politics? This is a focal point in the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates "business first" and "technology first." If we follow this, we will be busy with business and technology all day, detached from politics, detached from class struggle, and lose our way.

In 1964, our squad was responsible for installing a seven-meter-high chimney. Theoretically, we were all praised for our technical skills in competitions, so completing this task should have been easy. However, at that time, we were poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev, and while working, we were afraid of hitting our heads, resulting in more than ten people taking nine days to barely complete the task, almost causing an accident.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Emphasizing politics is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. This is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our work. Without Mao Zedong Thought, it is like a blind person walking, who will either fall off a cliff or hit a wall; with Mao Zedong Thought, we will have the fearless revolutionary spirit, become the most revolutionary, bravest, and smartest people, and there will be nothing we cannot do, no difficulties we cannot overcome.

Last year, our squad was tasked with erecting two sixteen-meter-high chimneys. The task was heavier, the personnel fewer, there were no mechanized tools, and not a single technical worker. What to do? I told my comrades: "We will not invite outside experts, nor will we borrow modern equipment. We will rely on Chairman Mao's Red Book to solve the problem." We studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and used Mao Zedong Thought to cleanse the dirt and filth in our souls. Seven people, using primitive methods, completed the erection of two sixteen-meter-high chimneys in less than three days.

Two different approaches, two different results. Emphasizing politics, everything goes smoothly; emphasizing technology, everything falls apart. The Chinese Khrushchev's "emphasizing business" and "technology first" is a soft knife that kills without blood. He wants to use emphasizing technology to oppose Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, to oppose using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. We must be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, be public-spirited, and firmly grasp the use of Mao Zedong Thought, forever walking the path of emphasizing politics.

### 靠毛泽东思想解决问题

　　靠毛泽东思想解决问题
　　某库营房班班长　郎芳林
    在一切工作中是突出业务、技术，还是突出政治？这是资产阶级和无产阶级两条路线斗争的一个焦点。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“业务挂帅”、“技术第一”。照此办事，一天到晚钻业务，练技术，就会脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争，就会迷失方向。
    一九六四年，我们班负责安装一个七米高的烟筒。按说，我们都是比武中得到好评的技术能手，完成这个任务算得了什么呢？但是，那时中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，干活时生怕砸了脑袋，结果十多人干了九天才勉强完成，还差一点出事故。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。突出政治就是用毛泽东思想统帅一切。这是保证我们一切工作取得胜利的根本。离开了毛泽东思想，就象瞎子走路，不走到崖下，也会碰到墙上；有了毛泽东思想，就会有无所畏惧的革命精神，就会成为最革命、最勇敢、最聪明的人，就没有办不到的事情，没有克服不了的困难。
    去年，我们班又接受竖两个十六米高烟筒的任务。任务加重了，人员减少了，没有机械化设备，连一个技术工人也没有。怎么办？我跟同志们说：“我们不从外面请师傅，也不去借现代化的设备，就是靠毛主席的红色宝书解决问题。”我们学习了毛主席《为人民服务》等光辉著作，用毛泽东思想冲刷我们灵魂深处的污泥浊水。七个人，用土办法，前后不到三天，就把两个十六米高的烟筒竖起来了。
    两种抓法，两种不同的效果。突出政治，一通百通；突出技术，一空百空。中国赫鲁晓夫的“突出业务”、“技术第一”是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。他想用突出技术来反对毛泽东思想挂帅，反对用毛泽东思想统帅一切。我们要对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的革命路线，心怀一个“忠”字，大树一个“公”字，狠抓一个“用”字，永远走突出政治的道路。
