The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong Province—including the Army, Navy, and Air Force—is unshakably loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the leftist broad masses" and earnestly implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. They actively supported the leftist broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and played a significant role in achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers reviewed and summarized their "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work over the past year, deeply feeling that firmly believing in the masses is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line requires correctly handling the masses.

Everything must start from the fundamental interests of the people, and "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. This is the fundamental attitude towards executing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks.

The Guangdong military personnel supporting the left have realized from a year of practice that in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the combat missions assigned by Chairman Mao to the military are to give the military a new mission to serve the people in this new historical period. We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings about the military's purpose, start from the fundamental interests of the people, and "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. Only in this way can we correct our fundamental attitude in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and achieve new victories for the people.

After the Guangdong military personnel supporting the left intervened in the local cultural revolution, they faced a severe struggle. The representatives of Liu Shaoqi in the Central-South region and Guangdong Province, such as Tao Zhu, and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to save their doomed fate, used every means to launch a desperate counterattack and employed various tricks. Moreover, Guangdong is on the front line of the border, and various class enemies took the opportunity to sabotage, making the situation of struggle extremely sharp and complex. The soldiers and officers felt from the struggle practice that only by striving to arm themselves with Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, could they keep up with the new situation of class struggle, consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, use Mao Zedong Thought to support and arm the masses, and give a devastating blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Only in this way could they consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions, carry out the ideological revolutionization of people, and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism.

Standing on the party's principles, resolutely implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, is an important sign of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. Supporting the left is fundamentally about supporting the leftist broad masses politically and ideologically. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, carrying out the ideological revolutionization of people, this is the political core within politics, the soul within the soul, and the core within the core. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to measure, identify, and handle everything. We serve the fundamental interests of the people, not the narrow interests of any small group or faction. Therefore, regardless of which faction, if it aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely support it; if it does not align with Mao Zedong Thought, we must help them correct it. For advanced masses, we must help them overcome their shortcomings and mistakes, and never indulge or tolerate them; for backward masses, we must see their positive factors and help them progress. We must dare to uphold the truth, disregard personal safety, dare to uphold principles, have no personal motives, remain unshaken under pressure, and remain impartial under praise.

The soldiers and officers, in reviewing the course of their "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work over the past year, said that in the early stages of the movement, the broad masses had not been fully mobilized, and sometimes the truth was in the hands of a few people. They insisted on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and were the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses. We should first look at the big picture, look at the main trend, and firmly support them. We should not judge by the number of people at that time. Supporting the minority is to educate and lead the majority so that the majority can grasp the truth; supporting the minority must simultaneously unite the majority so that the majority can stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some comrades mentioned that due to a lack of awareness of the struggle between the two lines, for a period, in some places, they did not support some revolutionary leftists enough, and even once suppressed them. In the process of learning from this lesson and seriously correcting the mistake, they improved themselves and the masses. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, the broad revolutionary masses had been fully mobilized, and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines had generally improved. We must firmly support the majority of the masses, especially support and rely on the active elements among them who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. In short, we must start from the fundamental position of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and correctly handle the masses with the spirit of extreme enthusiasm for comrades. The masses have different levels of awareness, but our responsibility to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to them should not differ, and our enthusiasm for caring for and helping the masses should not differ.

Firmly believing in and relying on the majority of the masses is the basic starting point for supporting the left without supporting factions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must believe in and rely on the masses." The broad ranks of soldiers and officers deeply felt in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work that only by deeply understanding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and establishing a firm mass perspective can they consciously achieve supporting the left without supporting factions.

The soldiers and officers said, intervening in the local cultural revolution, supporting whom? Uniting whom? Overthrowing whom? These are the primary issues that every person supporting the left must clarify. Only by "resolutely believing that the majority of the masses are good, and the bad elements are very few" can we correctly distinguish and handle the two types of different contradictions in the complex class struggle and actively guide the broad masses to unite against the enemy.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all class enemies are most afraid of the broad revolutionary masses uniting on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They always probe for directions, look for loopholes, and incite the masses to fight among themselves, attempting to shift the direction of the struggle and interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must do the opposite. No matter how fierce and complex the struggle is, no matter how many difficulties we encounter, we must firmly believe in and rely on the majority of the masses, believe in and rely on the main force of the Cultural Revolution, and "arouse hundreds of millions of workers and peasants to work together with one heart." The leaders of the Guangdong military repeatedly educated the personnel supporting the left to always keep the words "broad masses" in mind. While resolutely supporting the left, they must not forget to use Mao Zedong Thought to unite the broad revolutionary masses, and all work must be aimed at uniting the majority of the masses. They sent a large number of personnel supporting the left to go deep into factories, rural areas, schools, and institutions, maintain contact with various mass organizations, grasp the active thoughts of the masses, raise the masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and do work to promote unity, never pushing any faction of the masses to the opposite side. The soldiers and officers said: "We can only support the left, not support factions. Supporting one faction and abandoning another means abandoning Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The soldiers and officers felt that the class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. When various mass organizations have disputes and ask the personnel supporting the left to take a stand, they must consider the overall situation, not be misled by surface phenomena, not be panicked by urgent situations, not be shaken by external pressures, and never rashly take a stand. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to help them raise their awareness. In this way, they can avoid deepening the opposition among the masses and be beneficial to uniting the majority of the masses.

Everyone believes that at any time, we must stand on the side of Mao Zedong Thought and insist on the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. In one unit, a faction of the mass organization had strong factionalism and repeatedly asked the personnel supporting the left to help them crush another faction, saying that not doing so would mean "the banner is not clear," and they even colluded with mass organizations from other units to exert pressure, making the atmosphere very tense. In this situation, the personnel supporting the left insisted on principles and solemnly pointed out: A clear banner is the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not the banner of a faction. We can only unite to crush the enemy and never direct the spearhead at class brothers. They actively guided this faction of the masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, visited each family for heart-to-heart talks. The masses overcame factionalism, strengthened their party spirit, and the two factions quickly achieved revolutionary unity. Revolutionary masses movedly said: "The PLA supports the left without supporting factions, strengthening the revolutionary leftists, and frustrating the capitalist-roaders within the Party!"

Some masses doubted: Focusing all work on uniting the majority of the masses is "departing from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and blurring the struggle between the two lines." The soldiers and officers believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. The "Sixteen Points" clearly point out that we must resolutely rely on the revolutionary leftists, thoroughly isolate the most reactionary rightists, win over the middle elements, and finally achieve the unity of more than ninety-five percent of the masses. We unite the majority of the masses to fight the enemy together, which is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and is not departing from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or blurring the struggle between the two lines. On the contrary, starting from factionalism, only believing in oneself and not believing in and relying on the majority of the masses, and pursuing a "lonely" policy, this is truly departing from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Some masses saw that various revolutionary mass organizations had achieved revolutionary unity and said: "After more than a year of revolution, it ended in a draw, a stalemate." The soldiers and officers believed that true revolutionary leftists should take the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party as their opponent, fight for victory, and never take another faction of the masses as their opponent, confusing the two types of different contradictions. We fight for the victory of the entire proletariat, not for the "victory" of which faction. The broad revolutionary masses have been fully mobilized, making the capitalist-roaders suffer a crushing defeat, and the victory is clear. Today, the majority of the masses unite on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, making the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all class enemies unable to "sit and watch the tiger fight" and escape the fate of complete failure. The "stalemate" among revolutionary masses is precisely the "defeat" of class enemies.

Guiding the masses to liberate themselves with Mao Zedong Thought is the key to forming a vast cultural revolutionary army.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers deeply felt in the past year's "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work that whether they can correctly guide the masses to keep up with the situation is a key issue in forming a cultural revolutionary army that unites against the enemy, and it is also a test for the personnel supporting the left.

Some revolutionary masses, due to a lack of deep understanding of Chairman Mao's great theory and latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have low awareness of the struggle between the two lines, their thoughts do not keep up with the situation, and they have various different manifestations in different stages of the revolutionary movement. In the early stages of the movement, many people often did not like or adapt to the stormy revolutionary rebellion actions, temporarily leaning towards conservatism. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution developed to this day, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, some people, influenced by factionalism, showed "ultra-left" thoughts that were "left" in form but right in essence, using bourgeois and petty-bourgeois worldviews to observe and analyze the situation, drawing wrong conclusions, which is also a sign of low awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Some people use metaphysical views to look at problems, or use today's new situation that has developed to defend their past backwardness, boasting of their "consistent correctness," denying the achievements of others in the past; or they do not see the progress of others, thinking that being advanced for a moment means being forever "resounding," relying on old merits, and ending up in the backward ranks. These are all obstacles to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the path of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The soldiers and officers felt that using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the masses who temporarily do not keep up with the situation to stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is an important aspect of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. In dealing with the masses who temporarily do not keep up with the situation, we must have three basic concepts: First, do class analysis. Although the masses who temporarily do not keep up with the situation have shortcomings and mistakes, the vast majority are issues of understanding. They are our class brothers, love Chairman Mao, and support Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's latest instructions represent their fundamental interests, and they will surely grasp Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must distinguish between the enemies who use factionalism and the masses influenced by factionalism. Factionalism is a poisonous snake, and we cut the snake to save people, making class brothers liberated from factionalism. Second, see that the uneven development of things is an objective law, and the advanced, middle, and backward situations will always exist. In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, some masses temporarily do not keep up with the situation, which is also a normal phenomenon. We should allow them to make mistakes, allow them to correct mistakes, allow them to have fluctuations in their thoughts, give them time, encourage their progress, and firmly believe that they can liberate themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Third, use a developmental perspective to see that they have a process of development and change. We should see that "the backward strata among the masses strive to catch up with the advanced strata," and their temporary inability to keep up does not mean they will never catch up, and their inability to keep up in one aspect does not mean they cannot keep up in all aspects. They will surely, as the struggle deepens, raise their awareness and keep up with the situation, and even surpass others. The soldiers and officers believed that in dealing with the masses who temporarily do not keep up with the situation, we only have the obligation to unite, help, and educate them, and no right to exclude, discriminate, or suppress them.

Over the past year, the Guangdong military personnel supporting the left have always had deep proletarian feelings for the masses who temporarily do not keep up with the situation, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, and doing a large amount of detailed ideological and political work according to their active thoughts in various periods, helping the masses raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, overcome factionalism, and strengthen their party spirit. Many leaders and broad ranks of soldiers and officers supporting the left worked day and night, tirelessly going deep into various mass organizations, giving big lectures on Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the direction of the struggle of the revolutionary rebels, and the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They mobilized one household at a time and had heart-to-heart talks with each person. Many comrades also used their own experiences of raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines to inspire the masses. The masses said: "Chairman Mao points the way, and the PLA leads the way. We follow step by step!" The soldiers and officers excitedly saw that many masses who temporarily did not keep up with the situation in the early stages of the movement, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly caught up and joined the advanced ranks. They are playing an important role in the struggle to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers and officers, in order to help the masses overcome factionalism, guided the masses to arm their minds with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, listing the crimes of factionalism, exposing the reactionary nature of factionalism, revealing the enemy's use of factionalism to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, thoroughly uprooting the source of factionalism, and finding ways to overcome factionalism. The personnel supporting the left in a certain regiment, in helping the leaders of two factions in a factory in Guangzhou overcome factionalism, organized them to conduct "three remembrances and three reflections": First, remember the bitterness of the old society and see the sweetness of the new society, recognizing that there is no fundamental conflict of interest within the working class, only common goals and common enemies; second, remember the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line and see the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, recognizing that past "internal wars" were tricked by class enemies, and in the future, hatred should be directed at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; third, remember the harm caused by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism since the two factions opposed each other, and see the correctness of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further recognizing the direction of the struggle. Through "three remembrances and three reflections," the leaders of the two factions communicated their thoughts, actively conducted self-criticism, examined their own mistakes, and the two factions quickly achieved revolutionary unity.

In the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, many personnel supporting the left paid special attention to leading the masses to overcome factionalism with their model actions. They exposed their private thoughts in front of the masses, talked about their experiences in resisting factionalism, and inspired the masses' awareness of rooting out private thoughts and eliminating factionalism. When factionalism appeared in the masses, regardless of which organization it occurred in, they stood firmly on the side of party spirit, insisted on principles, distinguished right from wrong, helped the masses correct their mistakes, and did not "muddle through" between party spirit and factionalism. The masses said: "After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and seeing the actions of the PLA, we have confidence in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution." The soldiers and officers felt that factionalism is private thought, and to resist factionalism, one must have no private thoughts; to eliminate the interference of factionalism, one must first eliminate the interference of the "private" thought in one's own mind; to help the masses overcome factionalism, one must guide the masses to fiercely struggle against private thoughts. We help the masses overcome factionalism, aiming to cultivate a new generation of communists, not only to be a "promoter of revolutionary unity" but also to be a "sower of Mao Zedong Thought."

The soldiers and officers believed that to make the masses keep up with the situation, it mainly depends on the masses liberating themselves. Whether or not one believes that the masses can liberate themselves is a matter of believing in the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought. Many personnel supporting the left, in the process of doing ideological and political work for the masses, always paid attention to developing their internal power, allowing the masses to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought through various forms. The supporting units and the masses together held many Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In a few months, the province opened more than fifty thousand study classes of various types, with more than six million revolutionary masses participating in the study. The broad revolutionary masses, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, carried forward the revolutionary learning style, consciously struggled against private thoughts and criticized revisionism, "each doing more self-criticism," thoroughly breaking bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and firmly establishing proletarian party spirit, powerfully promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. The supporting units also paid great attention to discovering and utilizing advanced models among the masses, guiding the masses to educate themselves.

The broad revolutionary masses, through deeply studying and using Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unleashed tremendous revolutionary power, quickly launching a wave of backward catching up with advanced, advanced becoming more advanced, and striving to be models of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many people influenced by factionalism stood up, turned against factionalism, and launched an attack. They loudly proposed: "To unite, not to split; to have party spirit, not factionalism; to advance, not to retreat!" The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province entered a new stage.

Honestly being a small student of the masses is an important condition for the personnel supporting the left to keep moving forward.

Chairman Mao teaches us to transform the subjective world while transforming the objective world. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers, in reviewing their progress over the past year, said that in the new situation of class struggle, to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and his great strategic deployment, we must regard the masses as our teachers and honestly be small students of the masses. Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the great storm and turmoil of the masses' struggle, breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts, and firmly grasping the transformation of worldviews, can we better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. Practice has proven that the higher the awareness of transforming worldviews in the masses' movement, the closer one follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the more firmly one establishes the mass perspective, and the better one can correctly handle the masses.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers supporting the left in Guangdong always placed themselves in the position of small students, humbly learning from the broad revolutionary masses and young revolutionaries. They remembered Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings: Do not be afraid of criticism, and the entire army will correctly understand the world and transform the world in this process of criticism. They often actively listened to the masses' opinions and criticisms, accepted the masses' help and supervision. The soldiers and officers deeply felt that the surging masses' movement is the best classroom for transforming worldviews and the best battlefield for struggling against private thoughts and criticizing revisionism. In the fiery struggle of the masses' movement, the "official attitude" was blown away, the mass perspective was strengthened; conservative thoughts were burned away, revolutionary spirit was rekindled; the fear was driven away, and the courage was gained; the private thoughts were struggled against, and the public thoughts were established; the impact of factionalism was resisted, and the party spirit was strengthened, forging a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. Every time the masses helped and reminded us to overcome a shortcoming, it pushed our work forward a step. Every achievement in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work was achieved with the help of the masses.

The soldiers and officers believed that the position of being a small student of the masses can never change. When lacking experience and having difficulties in work, one must humbly be a small student of the masses; when achieving results and receiving praise from the masses, one must continue to humbly be a small student of the masses. Everyone said, "The 'Three Supports, Two Militaries' work is done well because Chairman Mao leads well; the PLA's prestige is high because Mao Zedong Thought's prestige is high. The good situation and achievements are completely due to the great leader Chairman Mao's affectionate care and the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and completely due to the broad revolutionary masses closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Without Mao Zedong Thought and without the masses, we would achieve nothing, and we must not put the credit in our own account. If we allow even a hint of pride in the face of achievements, we would easily be interfered with by the right or ultra-left, detach from the broad masses, and fall behind in the new situation.

Chairman Mao said: "The movement develops, and there are new things ahead. New things are endless. Studying the overall development of this movement is a major topic we must always pay attention to." The soldiers and officers followed Chairman Mao's teachings, and every time the masses' movement turned, they more humbly learned from the masses. Over the past year, the Guangdong military held many training classes for personnel supporting the left and convened many leadership meetings, firmly grasping the struggle between the two lines, using Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions as weapons, fully carrying forward democracy, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, educating themselves, summarizing and exchanging experiences of learning from the masses, "promoting achievements, correcting mistakes, and preparing for the next battle." Therefore, the soldiers and officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Guangdong, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, had unified thoughts, consistent steps, and united efforts from top to bottom, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, and achieving one victory after another.

The soldiers and officers clearly saw that as they entered the new period of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, their burden was not lighter but heavier; the requirements for the personnel supporting the left were not lower but higher. Everyone, from the practice of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, felt that their understanding often lagged behind the masses. Only by deeply rooting themselves among the masses and being good small students could they keep up with the developing new situation. If they thought they understood the masses and were familiar with the situation, and no longer humbly listened to the voices of the masses, they would not feel the great enthusiasm of the masses in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, could not deeply understand the new characteristics and situation of class struggle where the enemy uses factionalism and the broad revolutionary masses rise up to suppress factionalism, and in the surging revolutionary torrent, they could not advance in big strides and achieve new victories.

The soldiers and officers of the three armies stationed in Guangdong, through reviewing and summarizing their "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work over the past year, were more spirited and confident. They decided that in the new year, they would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, strengthen their party spirit, further implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, better believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, strengthen military-civilian unity, and in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, achieve new victories for the people!

### 无限忠于毛主席革命路线，正确对待群众——广东驻军“三支”“两军”工作的基本经验

    无限忠于毛主席革命路线，正确对待群众
    ——广东驻军“三支”“两军”工作的基本经验
    驻广东省陆、海、空三军，无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席和毛主席的革命路线，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，认真执行支左不支派的原则，用毛泽东思想积极支持左派广大群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺取广东地区无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利中，为人民立了新功。广大指战员回顾和总结了一年来的“三支”“两军”工作，深深体会到，坚定地相信群众，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心，忠于毛主席的革命路线，就必须正确对待群众。
    一切从人民的根本利益出发，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，是执行“三支”“两军”任务的根本态度
    广东驻军支左人员从一年来的实践中认识到，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的决战时刻，毛主席交给我军“三支”“两军”的战斗任务，就是在新的历史时期赋予我军为人民服务的新使命。必须时刻牢记伟大统帅毛主席关于我军宗旨的教导，一切从人民的根本利益出发，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，端正根本态度，为人民立新功。
    广东驻军支左人员介入地方文化大革命以后，面临着一场严峻的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫在中南地区和广东省的代理人陶铸等党内一小撮走资派，为了挽救他们灭亡的命运，千方百计进行疯狂反扑，施展种种阴谋诡计。加之，广东地处边防前沿，各种阶级敌人趁机破坏，斗争形势十分尖锐复杂。指战员们从斗争实践中体会到，只有努力用毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论武装自己，提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟，才能紧紧跟上阶级斗争的新形势，自觉地站在毛主席革命路线一边，用毛泽东思想支援群众、武装群众，给予党内一小撮走资派毁灭性的打击；才能自觉地用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，搞好人的思想革命化，彻底挖掉修正主义祸根。
    站在党性的立场上，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，是在“三支”“两军”中“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的重要标志。支左，最根本的就是从政治思想上支持左派广大群众。用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。必须用毛泽东思想衡量一切，识别一切，对待一切。我们是为人民的根本利益服务，不是为哪个小团体，或哪个山头的狭隘利益服务。因此，不管哪一派，凡符合毛泽东思想的就坚决支持，凡不符合毛泽东思想的，就帮助他们纠正。对先进的群众，要帮助他们克服缺点、错误，决不姑息迁就；对后进的群众，要看到他们的积极因素，帮助他们进步。要做到勇于坚持真理，不顾个人安危，敢于坚持原则，不存丝毫私心，压力面前不动摇，赞扬声中不偏心。
    指战员们在回顾一年来“三支”“两军”工作的历程时说，运动初期，广大群众还没有充分发动起来，有时真理掌握在少数人手里，他们坚持毛主席的革命路线，是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋，代表着广大人民的根本利益。我们就应当首先看大方向，看主流，坚定地支持他们，不能从一时的人多人少看问题。支持少数，正是为了教育和带动大多数，使大多数都掌握真理；支持少数，必须同时团结大多数，使大多数都能站在毛主席革命路线一边。有些同志谈到，由于对两条路线斗争的觉悟不高，在一段时间内，在某些地方，对一些无产阶级革命派支持不够，甚至一度压制了他们，在吸取这一教训、认真改正错误的过程中，提高了自己，提高了群众。随着文化大革命的深入发展，广大革命群众已经充分发动起来，普遍提高了对两条路线斗争的觉悟，就要坚定地支持大多数群众，特别要支持和依靠他们中间的决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的积极分子。总之，我们一定要从“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的根本立场出发，以对同志极端热忱的精神正确对待群众。群众的觉悟程度有差别，我们向他们宣传毛泽东思想的责任不能有差别，爱护和帮助群众的热忱不能有差别。
    坚定地相信和依靠群众的大多数，是支左不支派的基本出发点
    毛主席教导我们：“要相信和依靠群众”。广大指战员在“三支”“两军”工作中深深体会到，只有深刻领会毛主席的革命路线，树立牢固的群众观念，才能自觉地做到支左不支派。
    指战员们说，介入地方文化大革命，支持谁？团结谁？打倒谁？是每个支左人员必须明确的首要问题。只有“坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”，才能在纷纭复杂的阶级斗争中，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，积极引导广大群众团结对敌。
    党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人，最怕广大革命群众团结在毛主席革命路线一边，他们时刻窥测方向，寻找缺口，挑动群众斗群众，妄图转移斗争大方向，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们必须反其道而行之，不管斗争多么激烈复杂，不管遇到多少困难，都要坚定不移地相信和依靠群众的大多数，相信和依靠文化大革命的主力军，“唤起工农千百万，同心干”。广东驻军的各级领导反复教育支左人员心中要有“广大”两字，在坚决支持左派的同时，不能忘记用毛泽东思想团结广大革命群众，一切工作要着眼于团结群众大多数。他们派出大批支左人员深入工厂、农村、学校、机关，和各派群众组织保持联系，掌握群众的活思想，提高群众对两条路线斗争的觉悟，做促进团结的工作，决不把任何一派的群众推到对立面。指战员们说：“我们只能支左，不能支派。支一派丢一派，就丢掉了毛主席的革命路线。”
    指战员们体会到，阶级斗争非常尖锐复杂，遇到各派群众组织之间发生了纠纷，要求支左人员表态时，要以大局为重，不为表面现象所迷惑，不为事态紧急而慌乱，不为外来压力所动摇，决不轻率表态，并且要用毛泽东思想帮助他们提高认识。这样做，就能避免加深群众之间的对立，有利于团结大多数群众。
    大家认为，在任何时候，我们都要站在毛泽东思想的立场上，坚持支左不支派的原则。有个单位的一派群众组织派性较大，多次要求支左人员帮助他们压垮另一派，说不这样就是“旗帜不鲜明”，并且串连了外单位的群众组织来施加压力，一时气氛很紧张。在这种情况下，支左人员坚持原则，郑重指出：旗帜鲜明，就是毛泽东思想的旗帜鲜明，不是派旗鲜明。我们只能团结起来压垮敌人，决不能把矛头指向阶级兄弟。他们积极引导这派群众学习毛主席的最新指示，挨家挨户访问谈心。群众克服了派性，增强了党性，两派很快实现了革命的大联合。革命群众感动地说：
  “解放军支左不支派，壮大了无产阶级革命派，气死了党内走资派！”
    有的群众怀疑：一切工作着眼于团结群众的大多数，是“离开了毛主席的革命路线，抹煞了两条路线的斗争”。指战员们认为，毛主席的革命路线是最彻底的群众路线。十六条明确指出，要坚决依靠革命的左派，彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的群众。我们团结群众大多数一致对敌，正是捍卫毛主席的革命路线，绝不是离开毛主席的革命路线，抹煞两条路线斗争。相反，从派性出发，只相信自己，不相信和依靠大多数群众，搞“孤家寡人”政策，这才是真正离开了毛主席的革命路线。
    有的群众看到各派革命群众组织实现了革命大联合，说：“闹了一年多革命，落了个胜负不分，一盘和棋。”指战员们认为，真正的无产阶级革命派，要把党内一小撮走资派作对手，争胜负，决不能把另一派群众作对手，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾。我们争的是整个无产阶级的胜利，不是争哪个山头的“胜利”。广大革命群众充分发动起来，把走资派杀得落花流水，胜负已经分明。今天，群众的大多数在毛主席革命路线上团结起来，使党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人不能“坐山观虎斗”，逃不脱彻底失败的命运。革命群众之间的“和局”，正是阶级敌人的“败局”。
    引导群众用毛泽东思想自己解放自己，是组成浩浩荡荡文化革命大军的关键
    广大指战员在一年来的“三支”“两军”中深深体会到，能否正确引导群众跟上形势，是组成文化革命大军一致对敌的一个关键性问题，也是对支左人员的考验。
    有些革命群众，由于对毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大理论和最新指示缺乏深刻的理解，对两条路线斗争的觉悟不高，思想跟不上形势，在革命运动发展的不同阶段，有各种不同的表现。运动初期，有不少的人往往对疾风暴雨的革命造反行动看不惯，不适应新的变革，一时有些偏于保守。文化大革命发展到今天，在落实毛主席最新指示中，有些人则因受派性影响，表现出形“左”实右的极“左”思想，用资产阶级、小资产阶级世界观观察和分析形势，得出错误结论，同样是对两条路线斗争的觉悟不高。有的人用形而上学的观点看问题，或者以今天发展了的新形势，为自己过去的落后辩护，标榜自己“一贯正确”，否定别人过去的功绩；或者看不到别人的进步，自以为一时先进，就是永远的“响当当”，靠吃老本，结果掉到了落后的行列。这些，都是全面落实毛主席最新指示的阻力。
      毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”指战员们体会到，用毛泽东思想引导一时跟不上形势的群众站到毛主席革命路线一边来，是“三支”“两军”工作的一个重要方面。看待一时跟不上形势的群众，必须有三个基本观念：第一，做阶级分析。虽然一时跟不上形势的群众有缺点错误，但绝大多数是认识问题，他们是我们的阶级兄弟，是热爱毛主席的，是拥护毛主席的革命路线的。毛主席的最新指示代表了他们的根本利益，他们必将会掌握毛主席的最新指示。我们打倒派性，必须把利用派性的敌人和受派性影响的群众严格区别开来。派性是条毒蛇，斩蛇是为了救人，使阶级兄弟从派性中解放出来。第二，看到事物发展不平衡是个客观规律，先进、中间、落后三种状况，任何时候都会存在。在史无前例的文化大革命中，有些群众一时跟不上形势，也是正常现象，应该允许他们犯错误，允许他们改正错误，允许他们思想上有反复，要给予等待，要鼓励他们的进步，坚信他们能够用毛泽东思想解放自己。第三，用发展的眼光去看，承认他们有个发展变化的过程。要看到“群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层”，他们一时跟不上，不等于永远跟不上，一事跟不上，不等于事事跟不上。他们一定能够随着斗争不断深入发展，提高认识，跟上形势，甚至可以后来居上。指战员们认为，对待一时跟不上形势的群众，只有团结、帮助、教育的义务，没有排斥、歧视、压制的权利。
    一年来，广东驻军支左人员对待一时跟不上形势的群众，始终满怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，针对他们在各个时期的活思想，深入细致地做了大量的思想政治工作，帮助群众提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟，克服派性，增强党性。许多部队的领导干部和广大支左人员，日日夜夜，不辞劳苦，深入到各派群众组织中去，大讲毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，大讲革命造反派的斗争大方向，大摆党内一小撮走资派的罪状。他们一家一户地发动，一个一个地谈心。许多同志还用自己提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟的体会启发群众。群众说：“毛主席指方向，解放军当向导，我们步步跟得上！”指战员们兴奋地看到，许多在运动初期一时跟不上形势的群众，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，急起直追，已经跃进了先进的行列，他们在落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，正在起着重要的作用。
    指战员们为了帮助群众克服派性，引导群众用毛主席最新指示武装头脑，大列派性的罪状，大摆派性的反动性，揭露敌人利用派性破坏文化大革命的罪行，狠挖派性的根源，找出克服派性的办法。某团支左人员在帮助广州某厂两派头头克服派性时，组织他们进行了“三忆三看”：一忆旧社会的苦，看新社会的甜，认清工人阶级内部没有根本的利害冲突，只有共同的目标、共同的敌人；二忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害，看毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大，认清过去打“内战”，是上了阶级敌人的当，今后要把仇恨集中在党内一小撮走资派身上；三忆两派对立以来，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性所造成的危害，看毛主席的伟大战略部署的无比正确，进一步认清斗争的大方向。通过“三忆三看”，两派头头搞通了思想，主动进行了自我批评，检查了各自的错误，两派组织很快实现了革命的大联合。
    在“三支”“两军”工作中，许多支左人员特别注意以自己的模范行动带动群众克服派性。他们在群众中亮私、斗私，谈抵制派性的体会，启发了群众挖私心、剿派性的自觉性。遇到群众中有派性作怪，不管发生在哪个组织，都旗帜鲜明地站在党性的立场上，坚持原则，分清是非，帮助群众纠正错误，在党性和派性之间决不“和稀泥”。群众说：“学习了毛主席的最新指示，看看解放军的行动，夺取文化大革命全面胜利，心里就有底了。”指战员们体会到，派性是私性，要顶住派性，必须自己没有私心；要排除派性的干扰，首先要排除自己头脑中“私”字的干扰；要帮助群众克服派性，必须引导群众狠斗私心。我们帮助群众克服派性，要着眼于培养一代共产主义新人，不仅做“革命大联合的促进队”，更要做“毛泽东思想的播种机”。
    指战员们认为，要使群众跟上形势，主要依靠群众自己解放自己。相信不相信群众自己能够解放自己，是相信不相信毛泽东思想无比威力的问题。许多支左人员在向群众做思想政治工作的过程中，始终注意发挥他们的内在作用，通过各种形式，让群众直接掌握毛泽东思想。各支左部队和群众一起大办毛泽东思想学习班。几个月中，全省就开办了各种类型的学习班五万多期，参加学习的革命群众达六百多万。广大革命群众以毛主席最新指示为武器，发扬革命学风，自觉地斗私批修，“各自多做自我批评”，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。支左部队还十分重视发现和运用群众中的先进典型，引导群众自己教育自己。
    广大革命群众通过大学大用毛主席最新指示，焕发出巨大的革命力量，迅速掀起了一个后进赶先进，先进更先进，争当落实毛主席最新指示模范的热潮。许多受派性影响的人纷纷起来，反戈一击，向派性兴师问罪。他们响亮地提出：“要联合，不要分裂；要党性，不要派性；要前进，不要倒退！”全省的无产阶级文化大革命，跨进了一个崭新的阶段。
    老老实实当群众的小学生，是支左人员不断前进的重要条件
    毛主席教导我们，要在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。广大指战员回顾一年来自己的进步时说，在阶级斗争的新形势下，要紧紧跟上伟大统帅毛主席和毛主席的伟大战略部署，必须把群众当作老师，老老实实地甘当群众的小学生。只有在群众斗争的大风雨大世面中，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，狠抓世界观的改造，才能更好地掌握毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示，做好“三支”“两军”工作。实践证明，在群众运动中改造世界观的自觉性越高，跟毛主席的伟大战略部署越紧，群众观念树得越牢，越能做到正确对待群众。
    广东驻军广大支左人员，始终把自己放在小学生的地位，虚心向广大革命群众和革命小将学习。他们牢记毛主席的亲切教导，不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。他们经常主动听取群众的意见和批评，接受群众的帮助和监督。指战员们深深体会到，汹涌澎湃的群众运动，是改造世界观的最好课堂，是斗私批修的最好战场。在群众运动的烈火中，轰掉了“官架子”，增强了群众观念；烧掉了保守思想，焕发了革命精神；赶走了“怕”字，换来了“敢”字；斗掉了“私”字，树立了“公”字；顶住了派性的冲击，加强了党性的锻炼，炼出了忠于毛主席的红心。每当群众帮助和提醒我们克服一个缺点，就使我们的工作向前推进一步，“三支”
  “两军”工作的每一分成绩，都是在群众帮助下取得的。
    指战员们认为，当群众小学生的地位永远不能变。缺乏经验和工作有困难时，要甘当群众的小学生；有了成绩受到群众赞扬时，更要继续甘当群众的小学生。大家说，“三支”“两军”工作做得好，是毛主席领导得好；解放军威信高，是毛泽东思想威信高。形势的大好，成绩的获得，完全是由于伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和党中央、中央军委、中央文革小组的正确领导，完全是由于广大革命群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的结果。离开了毛泽东思想，离开了群众，就一事无成，绝不能把功劳记在自己的账本上。如果在成绩面前滋长了一丝一毫的骄傲情绪，就容易受来自右的或极
  “左”方面的干扰，脱离广大群众，在新的形势下就会掉队。
    毛主席说：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”指战员们遵照毛主席的这一教导，每当群众运动转折的时候，更虚心地向群众学习。一年来，广东驻军多次举办支左人员集训班和召开领导干部会议，紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，以毛主席的教导和最新指示为武器，充分发扬民主，集中群众智慧，自己教育自己，总结交流向群众学习的经验，“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”。因此，驻广东陆、海、空三军指战员在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下，思想统一，步调一致，上下同心协力，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，依靠广大革命群众，取得了一个又一个的新胜利。
    指战员们清楚地看到，在进入夺取文化大革命全面胜利的新时期，自己的担子不是轻了，而是更重了；对支左人员的要求不是低了，而是更高了。大家从落实毛主席最新指示的实践中体会到，自己的认识往往落后于群众。只有更深地扎根到群众中去，当好小学生，才能跟上发展着的新形势。如果自以为了解群众，熟悉情况，不再虚心倾听群众的声音，那就会感受不到群众落实毛主席最新指示的极大热情，不能深刻理解敌人利用派性、广大革命群众奋起围剿派性的阶级斗争的新特点、新形势，在滚滚向前的革命洪流中，就不能大踏步前进，夺取新的胜利。
    驻广东三军指战员，通过回顾和总结一年来的“三支”“两军”工作，更加意气风发，信心百倍。他们决心在新的一年中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，增强党性，进一步贯彻支左不支派的原则，更好地相信和依靠广大革命群众，加强军民团结，在全面落实毛主席的最新指示、夺取文化大革命的全面胜利中为人民立新功！
