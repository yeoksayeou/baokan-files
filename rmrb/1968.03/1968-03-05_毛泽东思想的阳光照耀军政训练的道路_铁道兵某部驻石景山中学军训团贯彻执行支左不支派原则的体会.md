The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of military and political training – the experiences of the military training team of a certain unit of the Railway Corps stationed at Shijingshan Middle School in implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions

Representative of the active study of Chairman Mao's works of the Railway Corps, Commander of the military training team stationed at Shijingshan Middle School in Beijing, Zhang Fengqi

"The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." "The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them." This is the glorious task given to us by the great leader Chairman Mao. Following the orders of the great commander Chairman Mao, we arrived at Shijingshan Middle School in Beijing in early March last year to conduct military and political training for revolutionary teachers and students. In the year of struggle and practice, we deeply felt that to complete this glorious task, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. All revolutionary mass organizations must be supported.

Shijingshan Middle School is a junior high school with over a thousand teachers and students. During the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, more than twenty mass organizations were established, and due to the influence of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, they split into several factions.

When our military training team first entered the school, there was a serious state of opposition among the mass organizations. They all claimed to be the left and demanded that the PLA take a stand to support them.

Should we take a stand or not? Should we support or not? If we support, whom should we support? Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." We did not hastily take a stand but sat down to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." Vice Chairman Lin Biao said, "Among countless principles, educating people with Mao Zedong Thought is the first principle." This made us realize that the process of supporting the left is the process of arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought; when the broad masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can liberate themselves and educate themselves, advancing along the course indicated by Chairman Mao. Therefore, our military training team should not be a "nanny" or a "referee," but should humbly learn from the masses, respectfully be students of the masses, and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

We first went to the broad masses, talked with representatives of various mass organizations and teachers and students with different views, and conducted home visits. Through investigations, we learned that among the more than twenty mass organizations, the vast majority were children of workers and peasants. They had an unparalleled love for the great leader Chairman Mao and a deep proletarian affection for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Through the education of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, their class consciousness continuously improved, and they were extremely indignant towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. Everyone's struggle was directed against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Although some organizations or individuals made mistakes of one kind or another in the early stages of the movement, once they realized their mistakes, they bravely stood up, strongly opposed the capitalist roaders, and launched a "counterattack." Most of our military training team members realized that although the mass organizations of Shijingshan Middle School were large and small, with long and short histories of struggle, with more and less contributions, and with strong and weak fighting spirits, generally speaking, their direction of struggle was consistent, and they were all revolutionary mass organizations. For all revolutionary mass organizations, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and give them active support. We cannot favor one faction while neglecting another, nor can we support one faction while attacking another. The main task before our military training team was to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the broad revolutionary teachers and students to achieve revolutionary great unity as soon as possible under revolutionary principles.

At the beginning, some revolutionary teachers and students, influenced by the extreme "leftist" trend in society, did not understand the significance of achieving revolutionary great unity. They thought that what we were doing was "making porridge," "compromising," and "centrism."

Seizing these active thoughts, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," especially on how to understand the issue of "supporting the broad masses of the left," and conducted repeated studies and discussions. Most comrades believed that those who support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, directing their struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, are all leftist masses. Chairman Mao has always taught us to firmly believe in the majority of the masses. In the early stages of the movement, under the rule of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary rebels who initially emerged might be in the minority. However, with the deepening development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev were overthrown, and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie they concocted and promoted was thoroughly exposed and criticized. The political consciousness of the broad masses reached an unprecedented height, forming a vast army of leftist masses loyal to Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line.

Of course, there will be a few bad elements mixed into the revolutionary mass organizations, but this is only a very small number. We must not shake the fundamental principle of "supporting the broad masses of the left" because of this and must distinguish between the few bad elements and a few bad leaders in the revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in these organizations.

Through such study and discussion, the military training team unified its thinking, deepened its understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction that "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," and laid the initial ideological foundation for firmly implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions in training revolutionary teachers and students. Helping leftist masses overcome factionalism is an important task in supporting the left

After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and conducting investigations, we clearly realized that all revolutionary mass organizations should be supported. However, how should we support them? The situation before us was that various revolutionary mass organizations had different degrees of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Due to factionalism, there were great rifts among revolutionary teachers and students and among classmates, often causing friction and "internal wars" over specific issues, making it impossible to achieve revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary leading cadres could not come forward, while a handful of class enemies were at ease and some took the opportunity to cause trouble and sabotage. Facing this situation, we helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study, understand, and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions; we studied with problems in mind and applied what we learned, strengthening proletarian party spirit and overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Some revolutionary teachers and students could not analyze the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie concocted by China's Khrushchev from a class struggle perspective but considered issues from personal gains and losses. For example, those who had once been deceived and executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie did not dare to admit their mistakes; some were afraid of being retaliated against if they admitted their mistakes. Students who had suffered from the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie often directed their hatred towards the teachers and classmates who had attacked them, forgetting the culprit China's Khrushchev. A student in Class 6 of the second year held a grudge against the teachers and students who had attacked her. Seizing this active thought, the deputy political commissar and a platoon leader of the military training team visited her home several times and studied Chairman Mao's teachings with her entire family: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution." This made her realize that those who had participated in attacking her were mostly deceived, and they were her class brothers and sisters. She denounced the crimes of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie at a meeting and said excitedly, "Thousands of accounts, tens of thousands of accounts, we should settle them with China's Khrushchev!" Those teachers and students who had executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie were deeply moved and rushed to the stage to make confessions. Some apologized to her face. She also actively checked her bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, like all reactionary things, will not easily retreat. Once we relax our vigilance, it will resurface. Just as the "internal wars" between various revolutionary mass organizations were gradually stopping and revolutionary great unity was about to be achieved, the leaders of two revolutionary mass organizations proposed: "To achieve revolutionary great unity, we should take the revolutionary rebels as the core." In other words, they wanted to take a few revolutionary mass organizations as the core, with them playing the leading role and the majority of revolutionary mass organizations following them as supporting actors. This told us that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in the minds of some revolutionary masses was about to flare up again. We must criticize and resist factionalism and cannot indulge it. The comrades of the military training team did not seize on trivial issues but firmly grasped the root cause and studied "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" with them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group and not paying attention to the overall interests, superficially not for personal gain but actually containing extremely narrow personalism, also has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect." Chairman Mao's words made those who originally wanted to be the "core" realize that this was not revolutionary but pure bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism; allowing factionalism to occupy the mind would deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They seriously checked their erroneous thoughts of "unique rebellion" and "unique leftism."

Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions and continuous struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, more than 90% of the revolutionary teachers and students in the school united and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, and also liberated cadres, establishing a three-in-one revolutionary committee. In April last year, the school officially began to study and make revolution.

We deeply felt that to adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, we must fight an offensive battle and not a defensive battle. Party spirit and factionalism, "public" and "private," are like fire and water. The more proletarian party spirit there is, the less bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism there will be. Helping revolutionary teachers and students to study, understand, and apply Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental way to promote ideological revolutionization and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. We focused on the study of the "Three Articles," breaking down the bourgeois worldview and establishing the proletarian worldview, which made the spiritual face of the revolutionary teachers and students completely renewed. In the past, they would argue endlessly over a seat or who should be the "core." Now, many classes that had once been opposed to each other and students who had once attacked each other sat together to have heart-to-heart talks and exchanged portraits of Chairman Mao.

In other words, to truly achieve supporting the left without supporting factions, on the one hand, we must believe in and rely on the majority of the masses; on the other hand, we must dare to criticize and do thorough ideological and political work on the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism that appears in the revolutionary ranks at different times. Supporting the left is supporting their revolutionary actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought; for actions that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and for bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, we must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to overcome it and guide petty-bourgeois thinking onto the track of proletarian revolution. Acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can eliminate all interference

In April last year, when Shijingshan Middle School achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one, and officially began to study and make revolution, a wind of opposition to studying and making revolution blew through society. This wind also blew into Shijingshan Middle School. Some people said: Shijingshan Middle School's studying and making revolution was "restoring the old," a "capitalist restoration"; they said that revolutionary great unity was "a big mix-up" and "must be thoroughly smashed," and so on. At that time, more than twenty teachers and students within the school were also influenced by this wind and withdrew from the revolutionary great unity that had just been achieved, establishing another "mountain stronghold." Inside and outside the school, they connected with each other, and hundreds, even thousands of people, successively stormed Shijingshan Middle School more than ten times, trying to smash the revolutionary great unity and obstruct studying and making revolution. When the broad revolutionary teachers and students of Shijingshan Middle School introduced the situation and experience of studying and making revolution to the visitors, the opposition set up a "capitalist restoration introduction station" opposite them; the broad revolutionary teachers and students insisted on studying and making revolution in the classrooms, while a group of people outside the classrooms held an "anti-restoration oath-taking meeting." For a period of time, Shijingshan Middle School became a battlefield for debating whether to study and make revolution and whether to achieve revolutionary great unity.

The comrades of the military training team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great instructions and the more they studied, the clearer they became: Shijingshan Middle School's achievement of revolutionary great unity and beginning to study and make revolution was precisely the result of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. This was completely correct, and other schools would inevitably do the same. The comrades of the military training team unanimously expressed: as long as it is Chairman Mao's instructions, we will resolutely carry them out; once carried out, we will not be afraid of attacks. No matter whether the attacks and interference come from the right or the extreme "left," we will firmly resist them.

Our firm stance in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line greatly encouraged the broad revolutionary teachers and students, making them more determined to defend Chairman Mao's instructions on studying and making revolution. They said: We have decided to follow Chairman Mao! With the support of the PLA, we are not afraid of anyone attacking.

When we did this, the attackers had even more complaints about us. Many revolutionary teachers and students, starting from their love for the PLA, advised us to temporarily avoid the situation, but we did not agree. The comrades of the military training team firmly believed that the broad masses loved Chairman Mao and listened to Chairman Mao's words. The few students within the school who opposed studying and making revolution was because we had not propagandized Mao Zedong Thought well. Some people came to attack, proving that they did not understand Chairman Mao's instructions, wasn't this a good opportunity for us to propagandize Mao Zedong Thought and do mass work? Therefore, we did not go anywhere but stayed in the school and stood on the front line, persistently propagandizing Mao Zedong Thought to the attacking teachers and students. No matter how fierce the attacks were, we always warmly received and patiently explained. We not only did this ourselves but also encouraged the revolutionary youngsters to correctly treat the masses, to firmly believe in Chairman Mao's great instructions, to firmly believe in the broad masses, and to regard each attack as a great examination, great summary, and great check of our revolutionary great unity and studying and making revolution.

We also cooperated with the revolutionary committee of the school to completely hand over Chairman Mao's instructions to the broad revolutionary teachers and students for discussion and to completely hand over the various "theories" put forward by the opposition for discussion, letting them use Mao Zedong Thought to measure, distinguish, and judge for themselves.

Those who opposed achieving revolutionary great unity accused: "Why did you turn more than twenty mass organizations into one Red Guard headquarters? This is a typical big mix-up!" Revolutionary students replied: No, this is revolutionary great unity with a consistent direction. They pointed out: Although there were various disagreements and opinions among revolutionary teachers and students, there was no fundamental conflict of interests. We have a common enemy, which is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev; we have a common language: loving Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao to make revolution! Chairman Mao called on us to achieve revolutionary great unity, so we should unite and join forces to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Those who opposed studying and making revolution accused: "The current direction of struggle is to criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, why are you studying and making revolution now? It's too early!" Revolutionary students took out Chairman Mao's instructions on studying and making revolution and replied: "Not at all, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee want us to study and make revolution on March 1st, and we only started on April 11th, how can it be said to be too early?"

Some people also accused: "Why don't you go out to connect? Training like this, the spirit of rebellion is about to be trained away!" Revolutionary students replied: "Wrong! Rebellion has class characteristics. We will definitely rebel against the capitalist roaders. Studying and making revolution is to deeply and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line politically, ideologically, and theoretically. For Chairman Mao's instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters, we should resolutely carry them out. Chairman Mao told us to study and make revolution, so we will definitely not go out to connect."

The comrades of the military training team and the broad revolutionary teachers and students, relying on the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believed in the correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings, and with Chairman Mao's great instructions as weapons, educated the masses who attacked studying and making revolution, isolated the enemy, tempered themselves, eliminated interference, and achieved victory after victory in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Struggle against the "private" self to be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Chairman Mao teaches: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the only purpose of this army." Adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions and using Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad masses of the left is a manifestation of the only purpose that Chairman Mao has set for our army. In the practice of carrying out military and political training tasks over the past year, we deeply felt that to correctly implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions and complete the task of training revolutionary teachers and students given to us by the great leader Chairman Mao, the comrades of the military training team must, in the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, demand high standards of themselves, and fiercely struggle against the "private" self, firmly establishing the "public" self.

The comrades of the military training team have both cadres and soldiers. Young soldiers are full of vigor but lack experience, especially the tempering of severe class struggle. Among the cadres, although many comrades have received long-term education from the Party and have been tempered by war, their ideological transformation is still far from sufficient. Therefore, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts still often appear in our minds, interfering with our implementation of the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions.

When we first entered the school, the emotions of the various factions were seriously opposed, and big and small matters all had to be brought to the PLA, and they demanded an immediate stand of support. Some comrades in our military training team produced the thought of "fear." Support, fear of supporting the wrong side. Not clearly expressing an attitude, fear of being accused of "making porridge" and "centrism." At this time, we studied the "Three Articles" and used Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to measure ourselves, overcoming the personalism of gain and loss. When Shijingshan Middle School implemented Chairman Mao's instructions to study and make revolution and was attacked time and time again, some comrades in the military training team produced a sense of difficulty and wanted to "quit." We brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's teachings on how to deal with difficulties. Chairman Mao said: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." This pushed back the thought of "retreat" (which is actually the thought of "private"). Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary great unity of Shijingshan Middle School became more solid and developed in the struggle, and studying and making revolution also entered the track. Those who wanted to attack disappeared, and those who came to visit and "learn from experience" increased greatly. At this time, some comrades produced a sense of blind complacency, feeling that the situation was settled and could take a breath. At the same time, some revolutionary teachers and students who had been tempered by the struggle also nurtured thoughts of competing for positions and fame. This means that the "private" self that was fought against in difficult times reappeared in good situations. We seized this thought of "arrogance," fiercely struggled against private thoughts, and repeatedly discussed the harm of the "private" self. Everyone realized: The victorious development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has raised the issue of breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts to a new height. With the "private" self, we cannot truly understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, cannot implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, and cannot resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This made the comrades of the military training team more conscious and proactive in carrying out a revolution in their souls and launching an offensive against the "private" self.

In the military and political training work over the past year, every step forward we took was a fierce struggle against the "private" self in our minds. The practice has proven that "to regard oneself as a force of the revolution and at the same time to regard oneself as an object of the revolution," to continuously break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, to promote ideological revolutionization, is an important guarantee for us to adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions in the stormy struggle and to implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    毛泽东思想的阳光照耀军政训练的道路
    ——铁道兵某部驻石景山中学军训团贯彻执行支左不支派原则的体会
    铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、驻北京市石景山中学军训团团长　张凤歧
    “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。”这是伟大领袖毛主席交给我们人民解放军的光荣任务。遵照伟大统帅毛主席的命令，我们于去年三月初来到北京市石景山中学，对革命师生进行军政训练。在一年来的斗争实践中，我们深深体会到：要完成这一光荣任务，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持支左不支派的原则。凡是革命的群众组织都要支持
    石景山中学是一所有一千多名师生的初级中学。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，先后成立了二十多个群众组织，由于受资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，他们中间又分成好几派。
    我们军训团刚进入学校的时候，群众组织之间存在着严重对立的状态。他们都说自己是左派，都要求解放军表态支持。
    表态不表态？支持不支持？要支持，支持谁呢？毛主席教导我们说：“没有调查就没有发言权”。我们没有匆匆忙忙地表态，而是坐下来学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”林彪副主席说：“千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育人是第一条。”这使我们认识到：支左的过程就是用毛泽东思想武装群众的过程；广大群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就能自己解放自己，自己教育自己，沿着毛主席指引的航道前进。因此，我们军训团不能做“保姆”，不能当“裁判”，而是应当虚心地向群众学习，恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生，当毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    我们首先到广大群众中去，找各个群众组织和各种不同观点的师生交谈，并进行家庭访问。经过调查，我们了解到，二十多个群众组织中绝大多数人都是工农子弟。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想有着深厚的无产阶级感情；通过无产阶级文化大革命的教育，他们的阶级觉悟不断提高，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派无比愤恨，大家斗争的矛头都是指向党内一小撮走资派的。尽管他们中间有的组织或个人在运动初期犯了这样或那样的错误，但是他们一旦认识清楚了，就勇敢地站出来，大造走资派的反，大杀“回马枪”。军训团的大多数同志都认识到：石景山中学的群众组织虽然有大有小，斗争历史有长有短，贡献有多有少，斗争性有强有弱；但是，总的说来，他们的斗争大方向是一致的，他们都是革命的群众组织。凡是革命的群众组织，我们就要遵循毛主席的教导，给予积极支持。不能亲一派，疏一派，更不能支持一派，打击一派。摆在我们军训团面前的主要任务，就是用毛泽东思想引导广大革命师生，在革命的原则下尽快地实现革命的大联合。
    开始，有些革命师生，由于受到社会上极“左”思潮的影响，对于要实现革命的大联合的意义不理解。他们认为我们这样做是“和稀泥”、“搞调和”，是“折中主义”。
    抓住这些活思想，我们反复地学习了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的指示，特别是对如何理解“支持左派广大群众”问题，进行了反复学习和讨论。大多数同志认为：凡是拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，听毛主席的话，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派的，都是左派群众。毛主席历来教导我们要坚决相信群众的大多数。在运动初期，在资产阶级反动路线统治下，开始冲杀出来的革命造反派可能是少数。但是，随着无产阶级文化大革命运动的深入发展，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派被打倒了，中国赫鲁晓夫所炮制和推行的资产阶级反动路线也受到了彻底的揭发和批判，广大群众的政治觉悟空前提高，已经形成了一支浩浩荡荡的忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的左派群众队伍。
    当然，革命群众组织中也会混进坏人，但这只是极少数。决不能因此动摇“支持左派广大群众”的根本原则，必须把革命群众组织中的极少数坏人和个别坏头头，同这个组织以及这个组织中的广大革命群众严格地区别开来。
    经过这样的学习、讨论，军训团内部统一了思想，提高了对毛主席发出的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”指示的认识，为在训练革命师生中坚定不移地执行支左不支派的原则打下了初步思想基础。帮助左派群众克服派性是支左的重要任务
    学习了毛主席的最新指示，经过调查研究，我们明确认识到：凡是革命的群众组织都应该支持。但是，怎样支持呢？摆在我们面前的情况是：各个革命群众组织都存在着程度不同的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。由于派性作怪，在革命师生之间，同学之间，有很大的隔阂，常常为了一个具体问题闹磨擦，打“内战”，革命的大联合不能实现，革命的领导干部站不出来，而一小撮阶级敌人却逍遥自在，有的趁机捣乱破坏。针对这种情况，我们就帮助广大革命师生活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示；带着问题学，学了就用，增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    有些革命师生对于中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线，不能运用阶级斗争观点去分析，而是单纯从个人的利害得失来考虑问题。例如，曾一度受了蒙蔽、执行过资产阶级反动路线的人，有的不肯承认错误；有的人怕承认了错误遭到报复。受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的同学，则往往把仇恨集中到打击过自己的教师和同学身上，而忘掉了罪魁祸首中国赫鲁晓夫。二年级六班有个同学对围攻过自己的师生抱着对立情绪。抓住这个活思想，军训团的副政委和一位排长就接连几次到她家，和他们全家一起学习毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”使她认识到，参加过打击自己的人，绝大多数是受了蒙蔽，他们是自己的阶级弟兄和姐妹。她在大会上控诉了资产阶级反动路线的罪行后，激动地说：“千笔账，万笔账，要跟中国赫鲁晓夫算！”执行过资产阶级反动路线的师生很受感动，纷纷抢着上台作检查。有的人当面向她道歉。她也主动地检查了自己的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，和一切反动的东西一样，是不会轻易退走的。稍稍放松警惕，它就会冒出来。正当各个革命群众组织之间的“内战”逐渐停止下来，要酝酿实现革命大联合的时候，有两个革命群众组织的头头提出：“搞革命大联合，要以我们造反派为核心。”说穿了，就是要以他们少数几个革命群众组织为核心，他们唱主角，其他大多数革命群众组织听他们的，为他们跑龙套。这就告诉我们：部分革命群众头脑中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性又要发作了。对于派性，只能批评、抵制，不能迁就。我们军训团的同志没有去抓枝节问题，而是紧紧抓住根本，同他们一起学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》。毛主席教导我们：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席的话，使原来一心想争“核心”的同学认识到，这样做不是什么革命性，而是十足的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性；让派性占领了头脑，就会背离毛主席的革命路线。他们认真地检查了“唯我独革”、“唯我独左”的错误思想。
    经过反复地学习毛主席著作和最新指示，不断地同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争，全校百分之九十以上的革命师生团结起来，很快地实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，并且解放了干部，建立了三结合的革命委员会。去年四月，全校正式开始复课闹革命。
    我们深深体会到：坚持支左不支派的原则，必须打进攻战，不能打防御战。党性和派性，“公”字和“私”字，是水火不相容的。无产阶级党性多了，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就少了。帮助革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，是促进思想革命化，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的根本。我们大抓了“老三篇”的学习，破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观，就使革命师生的精神面貌焕然一新。过去为一个席位，为了谁当“核心”，会纠缠不休。现在许多曾经对立过的班级，互相攻击过的同学，亲热地坐在一起谈心，互送毛主席像。
    这就是说，真正做到支左不支派，一方面要相信和依靠群众的大多数；另一方面，对于革命队伍中不同时期出现的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，要敢于提出批评，要做深入细致的思想政治工作。支持左派，是支持他们符合毛泽东思想的革命行动；对于不符合毛泽东思想的错误行动，对于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就要用伟大的毛泽东思想去克服它，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。照毛主席的指示办事，就能排除一切干扰
    去年四月间，正当石景山中学实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，并且正式复课闹革命的时候，社会上刮起一股反对复课闹革命的“拆台风”。这股风也刮到了石景山中学。有人说：石景山中学复课闹革命是“复旧”，是“资本主义复辟”；说革命大联合是“大凑合”，“必须彻底砸烂”，等等。当时校内也有二十多名师生受到这股风的影响，退出了刚刚实现的革命大联合，另立“山头”。校内校外互相串连，数百人，甚至上千人，先后十几次冲进石景山中学，要冲垮革命大联合，阻挠复课闹革命。当石景山中学广大革命师生向来访者介绍复课闹革命的情况和经验时，反对的人就在对面设立“石景山中学资本主义复辟介绍站”；广大革命师生在教室里坚持复课闹革命，教室外面就有一批人在开“反复辟誓师大会”。在一段时间内，石景山中学成了要不要复课闹革命，要不要实现革命大联合的辩论场地。
    军训团的全体同志反复学习毛主席的伟大指示，越学习就越明白：石景山中学实现了革命大联合和开始复课闹革命，正是落实毛主席的指示，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的结果。这是完全正确的，别的学校也必然要这样做的。军训团的同志一致表示：只要是毛主席的指示，就坚决照办；办了，就不怕冲击。不管是从右的或极“左”的方面来的冲击、干扰，都要坚决顶住。
    我们保卫毛主席革命路线的坚定立场，使广大革命师生受到很大鼓舞，更加坚定了捍卫毛主席关于复课闹革命指示的决心。他们说：我们跟毛主席走定了！有解放军支持，谁冲也不怕。
    我们这样做，来冲击的人对我们的意见就更大了。许多革命师生从爱护解放军出发，劝我们暂时避开，我们没有同意。军训团的同志坚决相信广大群众是热爱毛主席，听毛主席的话的。校内少数同学反对复课闹革命，是我们没有把毛泽东思想宣传好。有些人来冲击，证明他们对毛主席的指示还不理解，这不正是我们宣传毛泽东思想、做群众工作的好机会吗？因此，我们那里也不去，就在学校，而且站在第一线，坚持不渝地向来冲击的师生宣传毛泽东思想。不管来势怎样猛，我们始终热情接待，耐心解释。我们不仅自己这样做，还鼓励革命小将们正确对待群众，要坚信毛主席的伟大指示，坚信广大群众，把一次又一次的冲击，当作对我们革命大联合和复课闹革命的大检查、大考验、大总结。
    我们还协同学校革命委员会，把毛主席的指示完完全全交给广大革命师生去讨论，把反对方面提出的种种“论点”，也完完全全交给广大革命师生讨论，让他们自己用毛泽东思想去衡量，去识别，去判断。
    反对实现革命大联合的人指责说：“你们为什么把二十多个群众组织搞成一个红卫兵总部？这是典型的大捏合！”革命同学们回答道：不对，这是大方向一致的革命大联合。他们指出：革命师生之间虽然有这样那样的分歧和意见，但是没有根本的利害冲突。我们有共同的敌人，这就是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派；我们有共同的语言：热爱毛主席，紧跟毛主席闹革命！毛主席号召我们实现革命大联合，我们就应当联合起来，团结起来，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    反对复课闹革命的人指责说：“当前斗争大方向是批判资产阶级反动路线，你们为什么现在就复课闹革命？太早了！”革命同学就拿出毛主席关于复课闹革命的指示，回答说：“一点不早，毛主席、党中央要我们三月一日就复课闹革命，我们四月十一日才开始，怎么能说早了呢？”
    有些人还指责说：“你们为什么不出去串连？这么训来训去，造反精神都快训没了！”革命同学们回答说：“不对！造反是有阶级性的。造走资派的反，我们是造定了的。复课闹革命就是为了从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批深批透，批倒批臭。对毛主席的指示，对无产阶级司令部的命令，我们就应当坚决执行。毛主席叫我们复课闹革命，我们就决不出去串连。”
    我们军训团的同志和广大革命师生，就是依靠毛泽东思想的无穷威力，坚信毛主席教导的无比正确，以毛主席的伟大指示为武器，教育了冲击复课闹革命的群众，孤立了敌人，锻炼了自己，排除了干扰，一次又一次地取得了捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。狠斗“私”字，才能忠于毛主席的革命路线
    毛主席教导说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”坚持支左不支派，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众，正是体现了毛主席给我军规定的这个唯一的宗旨。在一年来执行军政训练任务的实践中，我们深深体会到，要正确地执行支左不支派的原则，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的训练革命师生的任务，我们军训团的同志，必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用高标准要求自己，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。
    我们军训团的同志，有干部，也有战士。青年战士有朝气，但是缺乏经验，特别是缺少严峻的阶级斗争的锻炼。在干部中，不少同志虽然受过党的长期教育，经受过战争锻炼，但是思想改造得还很不够。因此，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想还常在我们头脑里出现，干扰我们执行支左不支派的原则。
    刚开始进入学校，几派群众组织情绪严重对立，大小事情都要找解放军，而且要求马上表态支持。我们军训团有些同志产生了“怕”字。支持吧，怕支持错了。不明确表示态度吧，又怕落个“和稀泥”，“搞折中主义”。这时我们就学习“老三篇”，以毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导来衡量自己，克服患得患失的个人主义思想。当石景山中学执行毛主席的指示复课闹革命，一次又一次地受到冲击时，军训团内有的同志产生了畏难情绪，想打“退堂鼓”。我们又带着这个问题学习毛主席关于怎样对待困难的教导。毛主席说：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这样就把“退”字（其实是“私”字）顶了回去。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，石景山中学的革命大联合在斗争中更加巩固发展起来，复课闹革命也进入了轨道。要冲击的人不见了，来访问“取经”的人大大增多了。这时，有的同志又产生了盲目自满的情绪，觉得大局已定，可以松一口气了。在这同时，经过斗争考验的革命师生，有些人也滋长了争地位、闹名利的思想。这就是说，在困难时候被斗过的“私”字，在大好形势下又冒出来了。我们又抓住这个“骄”字，狠斗私心，反复讨论“私”字的危害。大家认识到：无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，已经把破私立公的问题提到了新的高度。有了“私”字，就不能真正领会毛主席的最新指示，就不能执行支左不支派的原则，就不能坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这样就使军训团的同志对于在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命，向“私”字打进攻战，更加自觉和主动了。
    在一年来的军政训练工作中，我们每前进一步，都经历了和自己头脑中的“私”字的激烈斗争。事实证明：“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”，不断地破私立公，促进思想革命化，这是我们能够在斗争的大风雨中坚持支左不支派的原则，执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要保证。
