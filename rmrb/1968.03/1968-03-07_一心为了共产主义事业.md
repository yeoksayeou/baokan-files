	Devoted to the Cause of Communism
	Cuī Xiùqí, an Outstanding Soldier

	The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly said: “Those party members who work hard will eventually ‘get the benefit.’” He regards hard work as a means to “get the benefit,” which is the business philosophy of a speculator. Communist Party members will not fall for his tricks.

	In the winter of 1966, we were cutting grass on the grasslands. The temperature dropped to minus forty degrees, and at night, strong winds blew off the felt covers of the Mongolian yurts, often waking up the comrades. What to do? I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching: “Concern for others should be greater than concern for oneself.” So, when it was deep into the night and everyone was asleep, I would get up to start the fire for the comrades. Since there was no water at our camp, I would run back and forth for more than twenty miles to fetch water, soaking my cotton-padded clothes with sweat. Working hard for the revolution and the cause of communism is the true nature of a Communist Party member. Not a single thought was given to gaining anything for oneself.

    一心为了共产主义事业
    某部五好战士　崔秀奇
    中国赫鲁晓夫无耻地说：“那些埋头苦干的党员”最后会“占便宜”。把埋头苦干作为“占便宜”的手段，这是投机商人的生意经。共产党员决不上他的当。
    一九六六年冬天，我们在草原打草，天气冷到零下四十多度，晚上刮大风，把蒙古包上的毡子都刮掉了，同志们常常冻醒。怎么办？我想起毛主席“关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导，等夜深同志们都睡着的时候，就起来给同志们烧火。我们住地喝不到水，我来回跑二十多里去打水，绒衣绒裤全叫汗水湿透了。为革命、为共产主义事业埋头苦干是我们共产党员的本色，一丝一毫也没有想到自己要得到什么。
