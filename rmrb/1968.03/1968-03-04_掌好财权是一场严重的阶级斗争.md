After the revolutionary power is seized, managing financial power is still a serious class struggle.

Currently, there are still some people who are completely unaware of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, spending extravagantly and wastefully, even causing anarchism in financial expenditures.

These people behave improperly. As soon as someone tells them to save and make a revolution, they angrily reply: "We should calculate political accounts, not economic accounts."

No, what you are doing is not calculating political accounts!

"Frugal nation-building" and "saving to make a revolution" are policies that our great leader Chairman Mao has always advocated. They are an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They are of great significance for the proletarian revolutionary factions to prevent and oppose revisionism, promote ideological revolutionization, further implement the great policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," achieve a new leap in industrial and agricultural production, and win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Not paying attention to saving to make a revolution is not just a matter of a few dollars; it is a matter of principle regarding whether one follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao. This is the biggest political account.

Comrade! When you waste social material wealth at will, have you thought about Chairman Mao's teachings: "Embezzlement and waste are serious crimes"? Have you felt that you have been attacked by "sugar-coated bullets"?

The class enemy is using their remaining influence and power to corrupt our thoughts, sabotage the socialist economy, and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must never be complacent!

To implement the policy of hard struggle and frugal nation-building, the fundamental thing is to follow the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and to revolutionize people's thinking. All regions, departments, and units must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and ensure that all savings measures are implemented.

### 掌好财权是一场严重的阶级斗争

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    掌好财权是一场严重的阶级斗争
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，掌好财权仍旧是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    现在还有一些人对资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻毫无警惕，大手大脚、铺张浪费，甚至在财政开支上大闹无政府主义。
    这些人行为不正，一听有人要他们节约闹革命，就声色俱厉地回答说：“要算政治账，不要算经济账。”
    不对，你们这样做，就是不算政治账！
      “勤俭建国”，“要节约闹革命”，是伟大领袖毛主席一贯提倡的方针。是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分。它对于无产阶级革命派防修、反修，促进思想革命化，对于进一步执行“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针，实现工农业生产新跃进，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利都有着极其深远的意义。不注意节约闹革命，不只是几个钱的问题，而是不紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的原则问题，是对毛主席不忠的问题。这就是不算最大的政治账。
    同志！当你任意挥霍社会物质财富的时候，你有没有想过毛主席这样的教导：贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。你有没有觉得自己已经受到“人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”！
    阶级敌人就是利用残存的影响和力量来腐蚀我们的思想，破坏社会主义经济，瓦解无产阶级专政。千万不能掉以轻心！
    实行艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针，根本的根本是靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠人的思想革命化。各地区、各部门、各单位必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把各项节约措施条条落实。
