The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two kinds: the proletariat's worldview and the bourgeoisie's worldview. Either it is the proletariat's worldview, or it is the bourgeoisie's worldview." "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." The core of the proletariat's worldview is the spirit of "public," and the core of the bourgeoisie's worldview is the spirit of "private." The proletariat wants to transform the world according to the spirit of "public," and the bourgeoisie wants to transform the world according to the spirit of "private."

The Chinese Khrushchev is the most stubborn defender of the bourgeoisie's ideological system and the representative of the spirit of "private." He has long promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism. The thunderous roar of the Cultural Revolution, ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, has spread across the entire country, illuminating the world. The hundreds of millions of proletarian revolutionaries have raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified" and exposed the Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly shattering his dream of restoring capitalism in China. However, the corrupt bourgeois worldview he propagated, as Lenin said, "will still rot and stink among us and poison us." Therefore, it must be severely criticized and its poisonous influence thoroughly eradicated.

The representatives of the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works at the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, during the conference, used the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, with immense anger, severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois spirit of "private."

"Selflessness" or "Suffer a Little Loss, Gain a Big Profit"

In a class society, everyone belongs to a certain class, either this class or that class. What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks for what class, different classes represent different class interests.

The proletariat is the most progressive and revolutionary class in human history. The proletariat deeply understands: only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. In the eyes of the proletariat, the interests of the people are above everything, the interests of the class are above everything, and the interests of the revolution are above everything.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: to be "selfless and dedicated to others," to have "no selfishness and self-interest," to be "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated to serving all the people of China and all the people of the world. This is the proletariat's worldview. With this great spirit of selflessness, people are cultivated to be noble, pure, moral, free from lowly interests, and beneficial to the people. Heroes like Zhang Zedong, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, and Li Wenzhong are such new people of communism. In their hearts, there is only the great leader Chairman Mao, only the great Mao Zedong Thought, only all the people of China and all the people of the world, and nothing but themselves.

All exploiting classes have risen by exploiting the people. The ideology of the exploiting classes is to maintain the exploiting system and to defend private property. The bourgeoisie is the last exploiting class in human history and also the most ruthless and barbaric exploiting class. Their ideology is permeated with the spirit of "private." The phrase "If one does not seek personal gain, one will be punished by heaven and earth" concentrates their entire philosophy of life and starkly portrays their life goal of seeking personal gain.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the representative of the bourgeoisie within our Party and the manager of the "private" shop. This old counter-revolutionary, his filthy soul, is the epitome of the extreme selfishness of all exploiting classes. Everything for "me" is his bible, his worldview. His entire body, from head to toe, every pore, exudes the stench of "private." "It is not about being selfless but about being selflessly selfish, balancing public and private interests, prioritizing public interests first and then private interests; suffering a little loss to gain a big profit." These two phrases from the stock exchange vividly depict the ugly face of this self-serving worm.

What is "balancing public and private interests," "prioritizing public interests first and then private interests," "combining public and private interests"? These phrases are all euphemisms for self-interest, using the name of public interest for private gain, using public interest as a means to achieve private ends. In short, it is all about private interest with no public interest. The Chinese Khrushchev clearly knows that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, landlords and capitalists can no longer openly exploit the people as they did in the past. This new characteristic of the times determines that this number one capitalist-roader within the Party can no longer openly advocate the fallacy of "living for oneself" as his ancestors did. After much deliberation, he finally "invented" the theories of "balancing public and private interests" and "melting public and private interests" to use public interest to cover up private interest and to seek private gain through public interest.

No matter how the devil disguises itself, it is still a devil. Under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese Khrushchev's true form of self-interest is not completely exposed? His theories of "balancing" and "melting" are not completely bankrupt?

The Chinese Khrushchev also added a colloquial explanation to his "balancing public and private interests, prioritizing public interests first and then private interests," which is "suffer a little loss to gain a big profit." "Prioritizing public interests" means first "suffering a little loss," and "prioritizing private interests" means then "gaining a big profit"; if one first "gains a little profit," then one will ultimately "suffer a big loss." To prove that his theory is a "truth of life" summarized from "practice," the Chinese Khrushchev personally testified:

"I graduated from high school but did not enter university.... Did I not suffer a loss? Not necessarily. I think many people are not as good as me.... I am the first generation to participate in the revolution, and now I am a member of the Central Committee." How arrogant and shameless! In his view, "not entering university" is suffering a little "loss," but "becoming a member of the Central Committee" is gaining a big "profit." However, he is smiling too early. Has history not already ruthlessly sentenced this big political swindler to death?

"Suffer a little loss to gain a big profit" is purely the business philosophy of a petty bourgeois. In the eyes of the bourgeois merchant, to do business and make money, one must first invest capital and then seek profit. If one cannot make big money, "gain a big profit," not only will they not "suffer a little loss," but they will not even suffer a small loss. Their philosophy of life is "plucking a single hair to benefit the world is not worth it." Therefore, the so-called "suffering a little loss" in the mouth of the Chinese Khrushchev is merely the capital for doing business. He completely treats the revolution as a "business deal," as a place for speculation. In his view, participating in the revolution is merely a means to seek personal fame and profit, a path to promotion and wealth. As long as one finds a way to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, first "suffering a little loss" and "working hard and enduring hardship" as "investment," once one has capital and gains the trust of the masses and the organization, one can "promote and enrich oneself" and "gain a big profit." What is the revolutionary cause, what are the interests of the people, all do not exist. This is his bourgeois worldview of using public interest for private gain and turning public into private. However, this Chinese Khrushchev, who does not know the meaning of shame, actually claims that his theory is "in accordance with the proletarian worldview of Marxism-Leninism." This is truly absurd!

The fundamental thought of Marxism-Leninism is to revolutionize. The vanguard fighters of the proletariat think of revolution, speak of revolution, and do revolution. They do not seek fame, do not seek profit, are not afraid of hardship, are not afraid of death, and are selfless and dedicated to the public throughout their lives. This lofty spiritual realm is something that the great traitor of the proletariat, the Chinese Khrushchev, will never understand.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "In any country, any ruling class, it does not allow the spread of thoughts that are contrary to its class position, it must insist on its thoughts to consolidate its political and economic system." We must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate the socialist system, and carry the revolution through to the end. We must establish the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in all fields, firmly establish the communist worldview of selflessness. This is the requirement of the times and the need for social development.

"Die for the People's Interests" or "Protect One's Own Life"

People will inevitably die, but how to face life and death, the two worldviews have two completely different answers.

The vanguard fighters of the proletariat, while alive, dedicate their lives to serving the people. "Wholeheartedly serving the people" is their only principle, and "being a person beneficial to the people" is their lifelong wish. Their lives belong to the people and the revolution. The interests of the revolution come first, the interests of the people come first. For the interests of the people and the revolution, they are ready to sacrifice their lives at any time. "We die for the people, and that is a worthy death."

Countless martyrs, they "lived greatly and died gloriously!" On the battlefield of gunfire and shelling, they bravely advanced, fearless of sacrifice, and shed their last drop of blood for the cause of people's liberation; in the enemy's prisons and execution grounds, facing the enemy's butcher's knife, they faced death bravely; in peacetime, no matter what position they held, they "bowed their heads and worked hard for the people," and when danger arose, they fearlessly stood up, risked their lives to save others, and used their blood and lives to protect the people's lives, the safety of comrades, and the property of the motherland. Dong Jianrui, Liu Huilan, Wang Jie, Li Wenzhong... countless shining communist warriors are our examples.

"With great sacrifices, we dare to change the heavens and the earth," live to fight for the interests of the people, die to dedicate oneself to the interests of the people! This is the worldview of the proletariat and also the view of life and death of the proletariat.

The filthy soul of the Chinese Khrushchev has no interests of the people, only himself. He lives only to seek his greatest interests under the name of "revolution," to become a "number one or number two great figure." The Chinese Khrushchev, like all figures of the exploiting classes, is also the most afraid of death, valuing his own life above all else. Therefore, he has always faithfully followed the philosophy of life of the traitor, because "when people die, what use is the principle?" When people die, what is the use of his "lifetime of wealth and honor"? This is the view of life and death determined by the extremely reactionary selfish worldview of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in the guise of a "high-ranking leader of the Party," preached what: Communist Party members should "love themselves, protect their own lives and health." "The Party, under possible conditions.... should abandon some of its work to preserve comrades"; to "preserve cadres," one can allow writing "confessions" to get out of prison, allow writing "anti-communist announcements" to be published in newspapers, allow performing various procedures of betraying the revolution, and crawl out from the doghole. The Chinese Khrushchev also attempted to force the absurd words "even betraying and surrendering can become a member of the Central Committee" into the report of the Party Congress. Such things, very vividly, depict his soul of a traitor and coward. The traitor group led by the Chinese Khrushchev, who has long been hiding within the Party, is the most concentrated and typical "specimen" of his bourgeois view of life and death.

A person who is dedicated to "loving oneself" and striving to "protect one's own life and health" will never be able to dedicate himself to the people. Although the Chinese Khrushchev also talks about "revolutionary interests" and "Party interests," these are merely a signboard he uses to deceive the world. To "protect" his life, the interests of the people, the work of the Party, and the principles of the revolution, he is willing to sacrifice everything. In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, all those who have sacrificed themselves for the interests of the people are all "fools." It is this Chinese Khrushchev who, in the white areas, did not "take risks" for dangerous tasks, did not go deep into the workers and peasants, and did not personally participate in the front lines of struggle; in the revolutionary war, he was cowardly and afraid of death, and yet, to preserve his own life, he indulged excessively. Is this not a true portrayal of his "love oneself" and "protect oneself"?

The Chinese Khrushchev is not only someone who, under the guise of "for the interests of the Party and the revolution," most concretely "protected" his own life, but he is also the one who is most afraid of revolutionary war. He has always been a follower and promoter of all lines of capitulation. During the democratic revolution, he advocated surrendering the people's guns and implementing class capitulationism. During the socialist revolution, he was terrified by the nuclear blackmail of imperialism and actively promoted the line of international capitulationism of "three reconciliations and one reduction." These historical facts are not a great exposure of his bourgeois view of life and death?

We revolutionary fighters, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, must firmly establish the resolute determination to dedicate ourselves to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is the concentrated expression of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and the main sign of thoroughly establishing the proletarian worldview.

"To Revolutionize" or "To Become an Official"

To revolutionize or to become an official? This is a struggle between two worldviews, and the core issue is still public versus private. After the founding of New China, our Party has become the ruling party. Under the new historical conditions, the contradiction between revolution and becoming an official is even more pronounced.

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "To achieve national victory is only the first step of the Long March.... The road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous." "We Communists are not here to become officials, but to revolutionize." The vast majority of Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, maintain the glorious tradition of hard struggle, unite with the masses, and are willing to be "old oxen" for life. They work diligently and honestly, humbly and sincerely, can go up and down, are both "officials" and "common people," and dedicate themselves to the revolution "with all their might, until death." They are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good Party cadre, is a model.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always been a schemer who, under the guise of "revolution," wants to become a big official and wants to be a "leader." For a long time, he has used various bourgeois selfish ideologies such as fame, position, and wealth to vigorously instill the poison of "becoming an official" into the broad Party members and revolutionary masses.

The Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about: "Party members must have a certain position to play a role." What is a "certain position"? He makes it very clear, that is, the "important position" of a "leader." To "serve the people"? First give me a "position"! What a position! Is this not very blatantly revealing the true intention of this black phrase: everything is false, becoming an official is true?

How can one become an "official"? The Chinese Khrushchev says: "In the past, one took the imperial examination to become a scholar, and now one takes the examination to become a Communist Party member; in the past, passing the imperial examination meant becoming an official, and now joining the Communist Party also means becoming an official." Look! The Chinese Khrushchev clearly tells people that now "participating in the revolution" and "joining the Communist Party" is the same as taking the imperial examination in the feudal era. Although the terms are different, the purpose is the same, all for the sake of an "official." Joining the Communist Party is to wear the cloak of a "Communist Party member" to become an "official" and have a "position." The Chinese Khrushchev has degraded the glorious title of Communist Party member to such an extent.

People still remember that the Chinese Khrushchev, blinded by the desire for officialdom, for the sake of becoming an official, was willing to completely sacrifice the interests of the Party and the people. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he publicly advocated surrendering the people's guns and capitulating to Chiang Kai-shek to go to the "National Government" to "become an official." Is this not very clearly telling people that in the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, as long as one can become a "big official," even public capitulation is "natural"?

To achieve his ambition of usurping the Party and the country, on the one hand, the Chinese Khrushchev openly advocates competing for fame, profit, power, and position, using this to corrupt some Communist Party members with weak revolutionary will, making them tools for restoring capitalism. On the other hand, he secretly sets up a bourgeois command center within the Party, recruits traitors, forms cliques, gathers followers, cultivates henchmen, and pulls spies, demons, ghosts, and snakes, and conspirators into the Party to prepare for counter-revolutionary subversion. The handful of capitalist-roaders and counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party who were exposed during the Cultural Revolution are such a bunch of bad guys.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Whose hands is our power in? Is it in the hands of those who are loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, or is it in the hands of those who oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought? This is a serious issue. The proletarian revolutionaries seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to solve this problem. We do not compete for personal power, but we compete for the Party's power and the people's power.

After the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, their status has changed, but the essence of the revolution must not change. We must thoroughly eradicate the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary thought of wanting to "become an official," firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "being both an 'official' and a 'common person,'" "regardless of high or low position, being a servant of the people," and always maintain the style of "humility and caution," "hard struggle." We must truly achieve: not leaving the masses in heart, not leaving labor in body, being loyal to Chairman Mao for life, revolutionizing for life, and being an "old oxen" for the people for life, to ensure that the red mountains of the proletarian dictatorship are passed down from generation to generation.

"Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism," Overthrow Sectarianism, and Be Selfless

Chairman Mao issues the latest instruction to "criticize self, criticize revisionism," which is a great battle cry, the fundamental policy of the Cultural Revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly hold high the banner of "criticize self, criticize revisionism," fiercely criticize "self," thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev as the representative of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and resolutely implement and fully carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

"With a golden monkey raising a thousand-catty rod, the universe is cleansed of ten thousand evils!" To thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism and better carry the struggle against revisionism to the end, we must fiercely criticize "self." With "self," one cannot distinguish between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism; with "self," one cannot hate revisionism, cannot hate it enough, how can one fight? With "self," one is easily poisoned by revisionism and falls into the mire of revisionism. Only without "self" can one be fearless. Only by fiercely criticizing "self," wiping out the old nest of "self," and firmly establishing "public," can one carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and forever preserve revolutionary youth.

In more than a year of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we proletarian revolutionaries have bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, defended against the test of struggle, and greatly raised proletarian consciousness. However, with the deepening development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the "self" in the minds of some comrades has also been exposed in various new forms. The spread of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sectarianism and anarchist thoughts in some mass organizations is a prominent manifestation of "self" at present.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sectarianism and anarchism are reactionary social currents. They attack the proletariat from different aspects in cooperation with the bourgeoisie. Those who are blinded by sectarianism speak sectarian language, do sectarian things, and everything is based on the interests of their small group, everything is for their own mountain stronghold. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group and not paying attention to the interests of the whole, on the surface it is not for personal interests, but in fact it contains extremely narrow personalism." Therefore, those who create sectarianism, fundamentally speaking, are still bourgeois personalism at work, still for the sake of an "I." Anarchism is not about not having a government, but about not having a proletarian government, but wanting their own, that is, a bourgeois government. The common ideological foundation of sectarianism and anarchism is an "I," the ideological poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's selfish philosophy of life and his consistent promotion of the bourgeois reactionary line. They are great enemies of the proletariat and great enemies of the revolution. The struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sectarianism, the struggle between revolutionary organizational discipline and anarchism, is an important form of the current struggle between the two worldviews of public and private. Overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sectarianism and overthrowing anarchism is an important battle task for us at present.

The unprecedented great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a great revolution that touches the soul, fundamentally speaking, it is a revolution to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview, a revolution to eliminate the private ownership concept of several thousand years and establish the communist public ownership concept. In short, it is a great revolution to reform people's souls with Mao Zedong Thought, a great revolution to establish Mao Zedong Thought.

To guide people's souls with Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out the revolutionization of thought, this is the politics of politics, the soul of the soul, the core of the core. We proletarian revolutionaries must always be loyal to Chairman Mao, with deep class feelings, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and work hard on the "apply" aspect, and explode the revolution in the depths of the soul. We must both regard ourselves as the driving force of the revolution and regard ourselves as the object of the revolution; both be the vanguard of criticizing revisionism and the pioneer of criticizing self. We must, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," launch a fierce attack on "self," thoroughly reform the worldview, and truly become new people of communism who are selfless and dedicated to the public throughout their lives.

"In the heart, there is a red sun, breaking self and establishing public as a pioneer." To firmly establish the "public" spirit of the proletariat, we must first highlight a "loyalty." Only by establishing "great loyalty" can we establish "great public," only by being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, can we climb the peak of communism on the road of thought revolutionization.

Long live the "public" spirit of the proletariat!

　　大立无产阶级的“公”字
　　——痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级“私”字观
　　中国人民解放军高等军事学院首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表革命大批判座谈纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”无产阶级世界观的核心就是一个“公”字，资产阶级世界观的核心就是一个“私”字。无产阶级要按照“公”字观改造世界，资产阶级要按照“私”字观改造世界。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级思想体系最顽固的维护者，是“私”字观的总代表。他长期推行一条反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。春雷一声天地动，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火燃遍全中国，照亮全世界。亿万无产阶级革命派高举革命“造反有理”的大旗，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，彻底粉碎了他在中国复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。但是他所宣扬的腐朽的资产阶级世界观，正如列宁说的：还会“在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”因此，必须痛加批判，彻底肃清其流毒。
    高等军事学院首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，在大会期间，运用毛泽东思想的强大武器，怀着无比愤怒的心情，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫反动的资产阶级“私”字观。
    “毫不利己专门利人”还是“吃小亏，占大便宜”
    在阶级社会里，每个人都属于一定的阶级，不是属于这个阶级，就是属于那个阶级。什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话，不同阶级的思想，完全代表不同阶级的利益。
    无产阶级是人类历史上最进步、最革命的阶级。无产阶级深知：只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。在无产阶级看来，人民的利益高于一切，阶级的利益高于一切，革命的利益高于一切。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：要“毫不利己专门利人”，要“毫无自私自利之心”，要“完全”、“彻底”“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”。这就是无产阶级的世界观。用这种一心为公的伟大思想培养出来的人，就是高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。张思德、黄继光、雷锋、李文忠等无数英雄人物，就是这样的共产主义新人。他们的心目中只有伟大领袖毛主席，只有伟大的毛泽东思想，只有全中国人民和全世界人民，唯独没有自己。
    一切剥削阶级，都是靠剥削人民起家。剥削阶级的思想，都是为了维护剥削制度，都是为私有制辩护的。资产阶级是人类历史上最后一个剥削阶级，也是最残酷、最野蛮的剥削阶级。它的思想，浸透了一个“私”字。“人不为己，天诛地灭”这句话，集中地反映了他们的全部人生哲学，赤裸裸地刻划出他们一心为私的生活目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级在我们党内的总代表，是“私”字黑店的总经理。这个老反革命，他的肮脏灵魂，集一切剥削阶级极端利己主义之大成。一切为“我”，就是他的圣经，他的世界观。他的全身，从头到脚，每个毛孔，都散发着“私”字的臭味。“不是大公无私，而是大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私”；“占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜”。这两句交易所的行话，淋漓尽致地画出了这条自私自利的大蠹虫的丑恶嘴脸。
    什么“大公有私”、“先公后私”、“公私兼顾”，这些黑话统统是一心为私的代名词，是借为公之名，行为私之实，是以为“公”作手段，达到为“私”之目的，一句话，就是大私无公。中国赫鲁晓夫清楚地知道，在无产阶级专政的条件下，地主和资本家再也不能象过去那样公开剥削人民了。这种新的时代特点决定了这个党内头号资产阶级代表人物，再也不能象他的老祖宗那样明目张胆地宣扬“活着为自己”的谬论，于是几经苦心琢磨，终于“发明”出“公私兼顾”、公私“溶化”这些以“公”掩护“私”，用“公”去谋“私”的
  “妙论”。魔鬼不管怎样乔妆打扮，毕竟还是魔鬼。在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下，中国赫鲁晓夫一心为私的原形不是完全暴露了吗？他的“兼顾”论、“溶化”论，不是彻底破产了吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫还特意对他的“公私兼顾，先公后私”加了通俗的注脚，这就是“吃点小亏，占大便宜”。“先公”就是要先“吃点小亏”，“后私”就是然后“占大便宜”；如果先“占小便宜”，那最后就要“吃大亏”。中国赫鲁晓夫为了证明他的这套“理论”是从“实践”中总结出来的“人生真谛”，还现身说法道：
  “我是中学毕业，没进大学，……我不是吃了亏吗？不见得。我看许多人还不如我。……参加革命我是第一代，现在当了中央委员”。多么得意忘形，一点儿也不害臊！在他看来，“没进大学”是吃了点“小亏”，但“当了中央委员”，则占了个“大便宜”。但是，他笑得太早了。历史不是已经无情地宣判了这个大政治奸商的死刑吗？
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”，这完全是市侩的生意经。在资产阶级商人看来，要做生意，要赚钱，当然得先拿出本钱，然后才能将本求利。如果不能赚大钱，“占大便宜”，别说“吃小亏”，连吃小小的亏，他们也是不干的。他们的人生哲学就是“拔一毛而利天下，不为也”。所以中国赫鲁晓夫嘴里的所谓“吃小亏”，不过是做买卖的资本。他完全把革命看作一笔“买卖”，看作投机的场所。在他看来，干革命，只是一种猎取个人名利的手段，升官发财的途径。只要设法混进革命队伍，先把“吃小亏”、“任劳任怨”作为“投资”，一旦有了资本，骗得了群众和组织的信任，就可以“升官发财”，“占大便宜”。什么革命事业，什么人民利益，统统是不存在的。这就是他假公济私、化公为私的资产阶级世界观。然而，这个不知天下有羞耻事的中国赫鲁晓夫却居然说他这一套“是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的”。这真是荒谬绝伦！
    马克思列宁主义的基本思想就是要革命。无产阶级先锋战士想的是革命，说的是革命，干的还是革命。他们不图名，不图利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为公，一生为公，根本不存在什么“吃亏”、“占便宜”。这种崇高的精神境界，是无产阶级的大叛徒——中国赫鲁晓夫永远也理解不了的。
    林彪副主席指出：“任何一个国家，任何一个统治阶级，它是不许可同它相反的阶级立场的思想传播的，它一定要坚持它的思想，以便巩固它的政治制度和经济制度。”我们要巩固无产阶级专政，巩固社会主义制度，把革命进行到底，就必须在一切领域里牢固地建立毛泽东思想的统治地位，大树特树一心为公的共产主义世界观。这是时代的要求，社会发展的需要。
    “为人民利益而死”还是“保护自己的生命”
    人总是要死的，但是如何对待生和死，两种世界观，有两种截然不同的回答。
    无产阶级先锋战士，活着就是为了一辈子为人民服务。“全心全意地为人民服务”，是他们唯一的宗旨，永远做“一个有益于人民的人”，是他们一生的愿望。他们的生命是属于人民的、革命的。革命的利益第一，人民的利益第一。为了人民的利益、革命的利益，随时准备献出自己的生命。“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    无数先烈，他们“生的伟大，死的光荣！”他们在枪林弹雨的战场上，勇往直前，不怕牺牲，为人民解放事业流尽最后一滴血；在敌人的监狱和刑场上，面对敌人的屠刀，视死如归；在平时，不论在什么工作岗位上，“俯首甘为孺子牛”，而一旦发生什么危险时，就临危不惧，挺身而出，舍己救人，用自己的鲜血和生命，保护人民的生命，战友的安全，祖国的财产。董存瑞、刘胡兰、王杰、李文忠……无数光辉的共产主义战士，就是我们的榜样。
      “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”，生为人民利益战斗，死为人民利益献身！这是无产阶级的世界观，也是无产阶级的生死观。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶的灵魂中，根本就没有什么人民的利益，只有他自己。他活着就是为了借“革命”之名，谋自己最大的利益，做“数一数二的大人物”。中国赫鲁晓夫，同一切剥削阶级的人物一样，又是最怕死的，把自己的命看得比什么都重。所以他又一贯忠实奉行叛徒的活命哲学，因为“人都死了原则还有什么用呢？”人死了，他的“一生富贵何所期”呢？这就是中国赫鲁晓夫极端反动的利己主义的世界观所决定的“生死观”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极端伪善、极端阴险地以“党的高级领导人”的身份，宣扬什么：共产党员要“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命和健康”。“党在可能的条件下……要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”；为了“保存干部”，可以允许写“自首书”出狱，允许写“反共启事”登报，允许履行各种叛变革命的“手续”，从狗洞里爬出来。中国赫鲁晓夫还妄图把“有变节自首的行为也可以做中央委员”这样荒谬的字句，硬塞到党的代表大会的报告中去。如此等等，十分鲜明地勾画出他的叛徒和怕死鬼的灵魂。长期隐藏在党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的叛徒集团，就是他的资产阶级生死观的最集中最典型的活“标本”。
    一个专心“钟爱自己”、努力“保护自己的生命和健康”的人，就决不能为人民而献身。中国赫鲁晓夫虽然也说什么“革命的利益”、“党的利益”，但这都不过是他用来欺世惑众的一块招牌而已。为了“保护”他的一条命，人民的利益，党的工作，革命的原则，他都是可以牺牲的。一切为了人民的利益而光荣牺牲的先烈，在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，统统都是“傻瓜”。就是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在白区时，有“危险”的事，从不“冒险”，从不深入工农群众，亲临斗争第一线；在革命战争中贪生怕死，而又为了自己养身惜命而挥霍无度。这一切不正是他的“要钟爱自己”、“保护自己”的一个最真实的写照吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫不仅是一贯在“为了党和革命的利益”这种好听的词句掩盖下，最切实地“保护”了他自己的生命，而且他是最害怕革命战争的。他历来就是一切投降主义路线的追随者和制定者。民主革命时期，他主张交出人民的枪杆子，实行阶级投降主义。社会主义革命时期，又被帝国主义的核讹诈吓破了胆，积极推行“三和一少”的国际投降主义路线。这些历史事实不正是他的资产阶级“生死观”的大暴露吗？
    我们革命战士，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，要牢固地树立起为毛主席，为毛泽东思想，为毛主席革命路线勇于献身的坚强决心，这是无限忠于毛主席的集中表现，是彻底树立无产阶级世界观的主要标志。
    “要革命”还是要“做官”
    要革命，还是要做官？是两种世界观的斗争，核心问题仍然是为公还是为私。新中国成立以后，我们的党成为执政党了。新的历史条件下，革命还是做官，这个矛盾更显得突出。
    毛主席谆谆教导我们说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。绝大多数共产党员和革命干部都是遵照毛主席的伟大教导，保持艰苦奋斗光荣传统，同群众结合在一起，甘做一辈子“老黄牛”。他们勤勤恳恳，朴朴实实，能上能下，亦“官”亦民，为革命“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”，无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。党的好干部焦裕禄同志便是榜样。
    中国赫鲁晓夫从来就是一个披着“革命”的外衣，一心想当大官，想当“领袖”的大野心家。他长期以来，用名利、地位种种资产阶级利己主义的黑货，极力向广大党员和革命群众灌输“当官”的毒素。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“党员要起作用，必须要有相当的地位”。什么是“相当的地位”呢？他说得很明白，那就是一个“领导者”的“重要地位”。要“我”为人民服务吗？先给我“地位”！好一个地位！这不是非常露骨地说出了这句黑话的真正用意：一切都是假的，当官才是真的吗？
    怎样才能当“官”呢？中国赫鲁晓夫说：“过去是考秀才，现在是考共产党员；过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党也可以做官”。看！中国赫鲁晓夫非常明确地告诉人们，现在“参加革命”、“加入共产党”同封建时代“考秀才”是一回事，名词虽然不同，目的却是一样的，都是为了一个“官”字。加入共产党，是为了披着“共产党员”的外衣，好当“官”，能有“地位”。中国赫鲁晓夫竟把共产党员这个光荣称号糟踏到了这种地步。
    人们还记得，被官瘾迷住了心窍的中国赫鲁晓夫，竟为了当官，不惜完全牺牲党和人民的利益，在抗战胜利后，公然主张交出人民的枪杆子，投降蒋介石，到“国民政府”中去“当官”。这不是非常清楚地告诉人们，在中国赫鲁晓夫心目中，只要能当上“大官”，就是公开投降也是“理所当然”的吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现篡党篡国的野心，一方面公开宣扬争名、争利、争权、争位，以此腐蚀一些革命意志不坚定的共产党员，使他们成为复辟资本主义的工具。另方面从组织上，招降纳叛，结党营私，搜罗党羽，培植爪牙，把叛徒、特务、牛鬼蛇神、阴谋家、野心家拉入党内，在党内秘密设置资产阶级司令部，为进行反革命颠覆作准备。在无产阶级文化大革命中被揪出来的党内一小撮走资派、反革命修正主义分子就是这样一批坏家伙。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们的政权究竟是掌握在什么人手上？是掌握在忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的人手上，还是掌握在反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的人手上？这是个严重的问题。无产阶级革命派夺党内一小撮走资派的权，就是要解决这个问题。我们不争个人的权，但要争党的权，争人民的权。
    我们无产阶级革命派在掌权后，地位起了变化，但革命的本色不能变。我们必须彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫要“做官”的反动思想的流毒，牢记毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，“不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，永远保持“谦虚、谨慎”，“艰苦奋斗”的作风，真正做到：心不离群众，身不离劳动，一辈子忠于毛主席，一辈子干革命，一辈子做人民的“老黄牛”，保证我们无产阶级专政的江山代代红。
    “斗私，批修”，打倒派性，一心为公
    毛主席向我们发出“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，这是伟大的战斗号令，这是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针。我们无产阶级革命派一定要高高举起“斗私，批修”的战斗旗帜，狠斗“私”字，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义，坚决贯彻和全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃”！我们要彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的复辟资本主义的阴谋，更好地把反修斗争进行到底，就必须狠斗“私”字。带着“私”字，就分不清什么是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义；带着“私”字，就不会痛恨修正主义，恨不起来，怎么能斗争？带着“私”字，就容易中修正主义的毒，以至堕入修正主义的泥坑。无私才能无畏。只有狠斗“私”字，抄掉“私”字的老家，大立“公”字，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能永葆革命的青春。
    在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们无产阶级革命派，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，捍卫了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，经受了斗争的严峻考验，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟。但是，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，我们一些同志头脑中的“私”字，也以种种新的形式暴露出来了。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮在一些群众组织中的泛滥，就是“私”字在当前的一个突出表现。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义是一种反动的社会思潮。它们从不同的方面配合资产阶级向无产阶级进攻。那些被派性迷住了心窍的人，说派话，办派事，一切从小团体的利益出发，一切为了自己的山头。毛主席教导我们：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义”。所以闹派性的人，从根本上说，还是资产阶级个人主义在作祟，还是为了一个“我”字。无政府主义，并不是不要政府，只是不要无产阶级的政府，而要他自己的，即资产阶级的政府。派性和无政府主义共同的思想基础，都是一个“私”字，是中国赫鲁晓夫利己主义人生哲学和他一贯推行的资产阶级反动路线的流毒。它们是无产阶级的大敌，是革命的大敌。无产阶级党性和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争，革命组织纪律性和无政府主义的斗争，是公和私两种世界观在当前斗争的一种重要形式。打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒无政府主义，是我们当前的一项重要战斗任务。
    伟大的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，从根本上说，就是大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观的革命，就是破除几千年来的私有观念，建立共产主义公有观念的革命。一句话，就是用毛泽东思想改造人们灵魂的大革命，大立毛泽东思想的大革命。
    以毛泽东思想统帅人的灵魂，搞好思想革命化，这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。我们无产阶级革命派一定要永远忠于毛主席，怀着无比深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，大学大用“老三篇”，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在灵魂深处爆发革命。一定要既把自己当作革命的动力，又把自己当作革命的对象；既做批修的先锋，又做斗私的闯将。我们一定要用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，向“私”字展开猛烈进攻，彻底改造世界观，使自己真正成为一心为公，一生为公的共产主义新人。
      “心中有个红太阳，破私立公当闯将”。我们要大立无产阶级的“公”字，就必须首先突出一个“忠”字，只有树“大忠”，才能立“大公”，只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能在思想革命化的道路上攀登共产主义的高峰。
    无产阶级的“公”字万岁！
