The China-Africa Friendship Association today issued a statement strongly condemning the atrocities of the Southern Rhodesian white colonial regime in killing Zimbabwe freedom fighters. It firmly supports the Zimbabwe people's just struggle for national liberation against American and British imperialism until final victory is achieved. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The white colonial regime of Ian Smith in Southern Rhodesia, under the instigation and connivance of American and British imperialism, brazenly killed five Zimbabwe freedom fighters on March 6 and 11. This heinous crime by the Smith white colonial regime has aroused the indignation and strong condemnation of the revolutionary people of Africa and the world. The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are on the verge of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are particularly outraged. The China-Africa Friendship Association strongly protests against this bloody massacre by the Smith reactionary regime.

The Smith white colonial regime, in collusion with American and British imperialism and the South African racist regime, has always been hostile to and brutally suppressed the Zimbabwe freedom fighters, and has thrown more than a hundred patriots fighting against the Smith colonial regime into prison. Recently, they have openly executed five of these patriots. This is a wanton attack on the four million people of Zimbabwe and a serious challenge to the people of Africa.

It is well known that American and British imperialism are the chief culprits in the suppression and massacre of Zimbabwe and African freedom fighters. In this massacre, they have again resorted to double-dealing, playing a double game, trying to deceive the people of the world and strangle the national liberation struggle of the Zimbabwe people, so as to maintain their colonial stronghold in Southern Africa. However, the people of Zimbabwe and Africa have sharp eyes. They fully understand that American and British imperialism is the backer and pillar of the Smith colonial regime, and their sworn enemy. The plots of the old and new colonialists and their lackeys will be thoroughly smashed!

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "'To lift a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries in various countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various forms of oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only serve to promote more extensive, more violent and more determined revolution." The five heroic sons and daughters of Zimbabwe, though they have fallen under the fascist executioner's knife, have not frightened the broad masses of the Zimbabwe and African revolutionary people. On the contrary, in recent days, the Zimbabwe patriots have actively launched guerrilla activities. They have taken the initiative to attack the Smith colonial army and have repeatedly struck at the enemy. More and more people of Zimbabwe and Africa are realizing a truth: The national liberation struggle of the Zimbabwe and African people against the oppression of American and British imperialism and white racism can only achieve real victory through armed struggle. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The spark of armed struggle of the Zimbabwe people will surely burn more and more fiercely and will ultimately bury the Smith colonial regime and the imperialist and colonialist rule in Southern Africa. We believe that the Zimbabwe people, who have a fighting tradition, as long as they strengthen their unity, are not afraid of difficulties, and persist in long-term struggle, will surely achieve final victory.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly on the side of the African people and the Zimbabwe people. We firmly support the Zimbabwe people's just struggle against American and British imperialism and the Smith white colonial regime for national liberation until they win final victory!

The Zimbabwe people and the African people will surely win!

American and British imperialism and the Smith colonial regime will surely be defeated!

    中非友协强烈谴责南罗殖民政权杀害津巴布韦自由战士的暴行
    坚决支持津巴布韦人民争取民族解放正义斗争
    津巴布韦人民武装斗争的烈火终将埋葬美英帝国主义和史密斯殖民当局的统治
    新华社二十七日讯 中国非洲人民友好协会今天发表声明，强烈谴责南罗得西亚白人殖民当局杀害津巴布韦自由战士的暴行，坚决支持津巴布韦人民反对美、英帝国主义，为争取民族解放而进行的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。声明全文如下：
    南罗得西亚史密斯白人殖民当局，在美、英帝国主义的唆使和纵容下，于三月六日和十一日悍然杀害了五名津巴布韦自由战士。史密斯白人殖民当局的这一滔天罪行，激起了非洲和全世界革命人民的无比愤怒和强烈谴责。正在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的七亿中国人民，对此更是义愤填膺。我们中国非洲人民友好协会对史密斯反动当局的这一血腥屠杀，提出最强烈的抗议。
    史密斯白人殖民当局和美、英帝国主义以及南非种族主义当局勾结在一起，一贯敌视和疯狂镇压津巴布韦自由战士，并将一百多名为反对史密斯殖民当局而斗争的爱国者投入死牢。最近，他们更公然向其中五名爱国者挥动屠刀。这是对四百多万津巴布韦人民的猖狂进攻，是对非洲人民的严重挑战。
    众所周知，美、英帝国主义本来就是镇压和屠杀津巴布韦和非洲自由战士的罪魁祸首。在这次屠杀事件中，他们又玩弄两面手法，阴一套，阳一套，妄图蒙蔽世界人民，扼杀津巴布韦人民的民族解放斗争，从而继续保持他们在南部非洲的殖民阵地。但是，津巴布韦和非洲人民的眼睛是雪亮的。他们深深懂得：美、英帝国主义是史密斯殖民当局的后台和支柱，是他们不共戴天的敌人。新、老殖民主义和他们的走狗的任何阴谋都将被彻底粉碎！
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”五名津巴布韦的英雄儿女虽然在法西斯刽子手的屠刀下倒下来了，但是，广大的津巴布韦和非洲革命人民并没有被吓倒。相反，近日来，津巴布韦爱国者积极展开了游击活动。他们主动袭击史密斯殖民军，不断给敌人以打击。越来越多的津巴布韦和非洲人民认识了一个真理：津巴布韦和非洲人民反对美、英帝国主义和白人种族主义压迫的民族解放斗争，只有通过武装斗争的道路，才能真正得到胜利。“星星之火，可以燎原”，津巴布韦人民武装斗争的星星之火，必将越烧越旺，终将彻底埋葬史密斯殖民当局和帝国主义、殖民主义在南部非洲的统治。我们相信，具有战斗传统的津巴布韦人民，只要加强团结，不怕困难，坚持长期斗争，就一定能取得最后胜利。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决站在非洲人民和津巴布韦人民一边，坚决支持津巴布韦人民反对美、英帝国主义及史密斯白人殖民当局、争取民族解放的正义斗争，直到赢得最后胜利！
    津巴布韦人民和非洲人民必胜！
    美、英帝国主义和史密斯殖民当局必败！
