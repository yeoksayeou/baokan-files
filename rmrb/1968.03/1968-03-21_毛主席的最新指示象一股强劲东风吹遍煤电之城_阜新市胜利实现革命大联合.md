Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the two revolutionary mass organizations in Fuxin City, Liaoning Province, have successfully achieved revolutionary unity and established the Fuxin City Revolutionary Unity Committee.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Fuxin City actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They launched a massive struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line headed by China's Khrushchev, achieving great victories. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist-roader elements within the Party and the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, the revolutionary masses later split into two factions, standing in opposition to each other. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have blown through the coal and electricity city of Fuxin like a strong east wind. Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries have conducted various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit. A powerful wave of revolutionary unity has surged forward. Good news has been pouring in from the hundred-mile mining area of Fuxin, and the city is resounding with songs of victory. Currently, over 900 grassroots units in Fuxin City have achieved revolutionary unity, and more than 200 grassroots units have established revolutionary committees.

On March 10, the coal and electricity city of Fuxin was adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums and gongs. Over 100,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army gathered to celebrate the birth of the Fuxin City Revolutionary Unity Committee. Representatives of the city's revolutionary unity committee declared at the meeting that they would resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and extensively and deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They vowed to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, promote revolutionary tripartite alliance, and better complete the tasks of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," "resume classes and carry out the revolution," deeply carry out the great criticism, and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units. They also pledged to further launch a new high tide of "supporting the army and loving the people," and to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.
