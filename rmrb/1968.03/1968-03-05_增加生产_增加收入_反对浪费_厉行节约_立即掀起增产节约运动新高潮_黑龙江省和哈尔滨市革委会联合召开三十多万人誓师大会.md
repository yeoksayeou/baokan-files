Increase Production, Increase Income, Oppose Waste, Practice Economy
Immediately Launch a New High Tide of Production and Economy Movement
The Revolutionary Committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City Jointly Hold a Mass Rally with Over 300,000 Participants

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 2, 1968 - The Revolutionary Committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City jointly held a mass rally on February 29 with over 300,000 participants, titled "To Further Economy and Revolution." The meeting called on all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations to, with the highest consciousness, greatest enthusiasm, and most resolute attitude, implement the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economy and revolution." The meeting urged the launch of a mass movement across the province to increase production, increase income, oppose waste, and practice economy.

Currently, the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Heilongjiang Province is excellent. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are known to every household; Mao Zedong Thought study classes are widespread in urban and rural areas; revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are increasingly consolidated and developed; the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has been thoroughly defeated. This revolutionary situation has greatly promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production in the province. However, class struggle remains acute and complex. A handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in society are unwilling to accept their defeat and are trying every means to sabotage the Cultural Revolution economically. Actively responding to Chairman Mao's call to "further economy and revolution," focusing on production, consciously strengthening labor discipline, and resolutely resisting and eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary economism and anarchism are urgent tasks for revolutionary cadres on all fronts.

Leaders of the Revolutionary Committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City spoke at the rally. They said: Implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "further economy and revolution" is of great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. This is an important aspect of the current struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses must fight against all acts of embezzlement, theft, and extravagant waste of state property, model the observance of state financial policies, and consciously maintain state financial discipline, becoming models of seizing revolution, promoting production, and economizing for revolution. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations' Mao Zedong Thought study classes should include economizing for revolution as an important learning content, and use whether or not to implement the policy of frugal construction and economizing for revolution as an important standard to measure whether one is a true revolutionary.

Leaders of the Revolutionary Committees emphasized in their speeches: Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism are the major enemies of seizing revolution, promoting production, and economizing for revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." We must launch a "people's war" across the province to thoroughly expose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, consciously maintaining revolutionary discipline and order.

They said, Heilongjiang Province is an important industrial, agricultural, and forestry production base in our country, shouldering the glorious task of supporting national socialist construction and supporting world revolution. Doing a good job in production is particularly significant. We must immediately launch a new high tide of increased production and economy, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and strive in every way to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

Leaders of the Revolutionary Committees also emphasized in their speeches: We must strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and resolutely crack down on the enemy's sabotage activities. They said, traitors and spies who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, a handful of unyielding capitalist-roaders within the Party, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, as well as spies and their running dogs from the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, Japan, and the Soviet revisionists, will never accept their defeat. Revolutionary cadres must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, expose the enemy's plots, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely crack down on the enemy's sabotage activities, safeguard the smooth progress of socialist construction, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

At the meeting, the Harbin City Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards (Preparatory Committee), and Middle School Red Guards jointly issued a call to the broad revolutionary masses in urban and rural areas across the province to economize for revolution, and commended a number of factories, mines, forest areas, and stores that had made outstanding achievements in economizing for revolution. The entire province's urban and rural areas listened to the live broadcast of the meeting.

The Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province, Pan Fusheng, leaders of the Heilongjiang Military Region, stationed troops, and the Revolutionary Committee of Harbin City, as well as leaders of various mass organizations, attended the meeting.

    增加生产　增加收入　反对浪费 　厉行节约
    立即掀起增产节约运动新高潮
    黑龙江省和哈尔滨市革委会联合召开三十多万人誓师大会
    新华社哈尔滨二日电　黑龙江省革命委员会和哈尔滨市革命委员会二月二十九日联合召开了有三十多万人参加的“要进一步节约闹革命”誓师大会。会议号召各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织，要以最高的自觉，最大的热情，最坚决的态度，贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，在全省范围内立即掀起一个增加生产、增加收入、反对浪费、厉行节约的群众运动。
    当前，黑龙江省无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓；毛泽东思想学习班遍及城乡；革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固和发展；资产阶级、小资产阶级派性被打得无处藏身。革命的大好形势有力地推动着全省工农业生产的发展。但是，阶级斗争仍然是尖锐复杂的。党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神不甘心他们的失败，千方百计地妄图从经济上破坏无产阶级文化大革命。积极响应毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，抓好生产，自觉地加强劳动纪律，坚决抵制和肃清反革命经济主义和无政府主义流毒，是各条战线上的无产阶级革命派刻不容缓的战斗任务。
    黑龙江省革命委员会和哈尔滨市革命委员会的负责同志在大会上讲了话。他们说：贯彻执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利有着十分重要的意义。这是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众要同一切贪污、盗窃和铺张浪费国家财产的行为进行斗争，模范地遵守国家财政政策，自觉地维护国家财政纪律，做抓革命，促生产，节约闹革命的模范。各级革命委员会、各革命群众组织举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都要把节约闹革命作为一项重要学习内容，把是否执行勤俭建国、节约闹革命的方针当作衡量是不是真正革命者的重要标准。
    革命委员会负责同志在讲话中强调指出：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义是当前抓革命，促生产，节约闹革命的大敌。毛主席教导我们：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。我们必须在全省进一步掀起围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义的“人民战争”，把派性和无政府主义彻底搞臭，自觉地维护革命纪律和革命秩序。
    他们说，黑龙江省是我国重要的工业、农业和林业生产基地，它担负着支援国家社会主义建设和支援世界革命的光荣任务，搞好生产尤其有着特殊意义。我们要立即掀起增产节约的新高潮，挑起革命和生产两副重担，千方百计地完成和超额完成国家计划。
    革命委员会负责人在讲话中还着重指出，必须加强阶级斗争观念，坚决打击阶级敌人的破坏活动。他们说，混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，以及美、蒋、日、苏修特务和他们的走狗，绝不会甘心于他们的失败。无产阶级革命派一定要提高革命警惕，识破阶级敌人的阴谋，加强无产阶级专政，坚决打击阶级敌人的破坏活动，保卫社会主义建设的顺利进行，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    会上，哈尔滨市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会（筹委会）、中学红代会联合向全省广大城乡革命群众发出节约闹革命的倡议书，并表扬了一批在节约闹革命中作出优异成绩的工厂、煤矿、林区和商店。全省城乡收听了大会的实况。
    黑龙江省革命委员会主任委员潘复生，黑龙江省军区、驻军、哈尔滨市革命委员会负责人，以及各群众组织负责人出席了大会。
