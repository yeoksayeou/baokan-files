The two major factions in the Tonghua region of Jilin Province, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have been continuously overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in the cadre issue, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and adhering to Chairman Mao's cadre policies. They have comprehensively and historically evaluated cadres, helping the former Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Tonghua Regional Committee, Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo, to stand up for the revolution. Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo, with the help of revolutionary masses, deeply reflected on and examined their own mistakes, gaining the understanding and trust of the broad revolutionary masses, and were elected as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Tonghua Regional Revolutionary Committee, respectively.

Factionalism blocked the throat,
Unable to speak with party spirit

Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo both implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution and made certain mistakes in their past work. Therefore, they were severely criticized by the revolutionary masses during the Cultural Revolution. Later, the two revolutionary mass organizations in the Tonghua region had differing opinions on these two cadres: Tonghua Commune believed Feng Ji was a good cadre, while Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee insisted on overthrowing him; Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee wanted to support Jiang Zhuo, but Tonghua Commune insisted on overthrowing him. Due to factionalism, the two mass organizations had long-standing disagreements over these two cadres, which became one of the main reasons for their "internal strife."

At the end of December last year, the two factions in the Tonghua region, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieved revolutionary unity through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Afterwards, they analyzed Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo comprehensively and historically according to Chairman Mao's teachings: "One must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at a cadre's momentary actions, but also at the cadre's entire history and all his work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." They concluded that although these two cadres had made certain mistakes, they had done some work for the Party over the past few decades, their fundamental loyalty was good, and they should not be overthrown. However, when it came to helping these two cadres stand up, both sides had reservations. They were unwilling to admit that the other side was correct and they were wrong, fearing that this would mean admitting defeat; at the same time, they were afraid that supporting a cadre they had previously called to be overthrown would make them look like they were hitting themselves in the face. Due to these reservations, when it came time to turn around, they were again entangled by the venomous snake of factionalism. At a coordination meeting, the representative of Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee originally planned to raise two doubts about Feng Ji. If the materials held by Tonghua Commune could answer these, they would agree to help Feng Ji stand up together. However, when they heard the representative of Tonghua Commune raise eight questions about Jiang Zhuo at the coordination meeting, and the conclusion was still to "overthrow," they thought, if you want to overthrow the Jiang Zhuo we support, I will also overthrow the Feng Ji you support. Thus, they brought out the five points of opinion about Feng Ji that their organization had originally negated, immediately raising seven points of opinion on the spot, with the conclusion also being "overthrow." The meeting was at an impasse, with neither side yielding.

The responsible comrade from the PLA believed that the reason for this stalemate was that factionalism had blocked their throats, preventing them from speaking with party spirit. He studied Chairman Mao's teachings with them: "To lead a great revolution, one must have a great party, many excellent cadres.... These cadres and leaders understand Marxism-Leninism, have political foresight, have work ability, are rich in spirit of sacrifice, can solve problems independently, remain steadfast in the face of difficulties, and work loyally for the nation, the class, and the party." Through study, they understood that revolutionary leading cadres are cadres of the proletariat, cadres of the party, and not representatives of any faction or clique. Whether one can correctly handle cadres from the standpoint of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a touchstone of our loyalty to Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionary faction must overcome factionalism in the cadre issue, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres, and enthusiastically help cadres stand up for the revolution. Both sides' representatives fought against their selfishness, determined to cut off the venomous snake of factionalism that had wrapped around them, correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policies, and jointly help revolutionary leading cadres stand up, creating conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Only by adhering to party principles,
Can factionalism be eliminated

Just as Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee agreed to release Feng Ji and Tonghua Commune agreed to release Jiang Zhuo, and both sides' opinions gradually converged, a new disagreement arose over the number of revolutionary leading cadres participating in the regional revolutionary committee. Some leaders in Tonghua Commune felt that if Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo both stood up, one for one, it still could not prove that their faction had achieved any "victory," and proposed that another leading cadre from the regional committee, who was controversial between the two sides, participate in the three-in-one combination, hoping to win over the other side with a two-to-one advantage. After Tonghua Commune proposed this plan, someone in Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee suggested that if he participates, we should also participate in an "equal exchange." Thus, Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee also proposed another leading cadre who was controversial. In this way, a new obstacle arose on the road to achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

In response to this factional thought of competing for advantages, the responsible comrade from the PLA provided specific help to the leaders of both factions, studying Chairman Mao's teachings with them: "Paying attention only to the interests of one's own small group and not to the interests of the whole, outwardly not for oneself but inwardly containing extremely narrow personal interests, similarly has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect." They realized that endlessly competing for positions and factional advantages would delay the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions indefinitely and affect their implementation. A standing committee member of Tonghua Commune said, "The 'principle' of competing for factional victories and the number of positions is a complete factional principle. We must resolutely smash the factional principle and adhere to the party principle, adhere to the principle of Mao Zedong Thought." A standing committee member of Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee said: "In the surging tide of the Cultural Revolution, are we the driving force of the revolution, propelling the revolutionary ship to break waves and advance, or are we the reef in the tide, obstructing the revolutionary ship's advance? This is a new test for us proletarian revolutionaries. 'Equal exchange' is factionalism against factionalism, selfishness against selfishness. We must take the lead in digging out the 'self,' eliminating factionalism, and promoting the Cultural Revolution forward."

After both sides raised their awareness, they expressed that they would not compete for positions due to factionalism but would strive for the fastest and best implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to promote the victory of the Cultural Revolution in the Tonghua region. Those revolutionary leading cadres who could stand up first would be helped to stand up first, promoting the early realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. As for other leading cadres who still had disputes, they would be gradually resolved after mobilizing the masses. Thus, both sides withdrew their previously proposed plans for the two controversial cadres and agreed to nominate the revolutionary leading cadres Feng Ji and Jiang Zhuo to participate in the three-in-one combination. Together with the other two revolutionary leading cadres that both factions had already agreed on earlier, a total of four people stood up, laying a good foundation for the establishment of the revolutionary committee.

Digging out the roots of factionalism,
Party principles triumph

The factionalism that emerged in the competition for leading cadre positions was defeated, but the roots of factionalism were not yet completely dug out. When the two factions coordinated on who would serve as the first-in-command of the revolutionary committee, a new high-and-low dispute arose. The leaders of Tonghua Red Revolutionary Committee thought: Our organization is large, with many people. In the issue of leading cadre positions, we have achieved equal combination. If we put the Feng Ji, whom we have been calling to overthrow for more than a year, in the first position, and let the Jiang Zhuo, whom we have been supporting for more than a year, sit in the second position, that would be smearing our red revolutionary banner. We absolutely cannot allow that. The leaders of Tonghua Commune thought, We are pushing the Feng Ji, whom we have been supporting for a long time, to be the first-in-command, and placing Jiang Zhuo in the second position. This is not just a matter of the order of the two leading cadres, but also a competition between our two factions. The position of the first-in-command must be contested. The two factions were unwilling to yield, and finally proposed that neither of the two cadres should be the first-in-command, and requested that the responsible comrade from the PLA serve as the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee. The responsible comrade from the PLA believed that the competition over who would be the first-in-command was a continuation of the struggle between party spirit and factionalism, a resurrection of "self as the core" in the new situation. Without completely eliminating factionalism, the revolutionary three-in-one combination could not be quickly realized. Therefore, he organized the leaders of the two factions to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant teachings on correctly handling cadres. The leaders of the two factions, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, shifted from competing for positions to digging out the roots of factionalism in their thoughts. They both actively made self-criticisms, exposing their factional bottoms in front of the other side. Both sides cut off their factional tails of competing for high and low positions, and the endless dispute stopped. They evaluated the two revolutionary leading cadres comprehensively according to the five conditions proposed by Chairman Mao for cultivating revolutionary successors and unanimously agreed that it was more appropriate for Feng Ji to serve as the first-in-command of the Revolutionary Committee.

Factionalism was defeated, and the issue of Feng Ji serving as the first-in-command was resolved. The leaders of the two factions, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, did cadre work separately and jointly promoted the rapid establishment of the Revolutionary Committee. The resolute actions of the proletarian revolutionary faction to listen to Chairman Mao's words and act strictly according to his instructions deeply moved the revolutionary leading cadres. They unanimously expressed their determination to take the revolutionary faction as an example, deeply reflect, thoroughly correct their mistakes, and be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao to do revolution for life.

Editor's Note: The newly born revolutionary committees must adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings, establish a new revolutionary style, "that is, the style of combining theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the masses, and the style of self-criticism." Establishing this style is a revolutionary need, a need of the masses, and a fundamental requirement for the revolutionary committees to achieve revolutionization.

The standing committee members participating in the first meeting of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, during the period of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, formed a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought and went deep into the grassroots, combining learning with practice and combining leadership with the masses. This is a good beginning for establishing this new revolutionary style.

With this new revolutionary style, no matter how much work there is, how great the difficulties are, or how complex the struggles are, they can all be victorious. The standing committee members of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, personally visiting those mining areas that had long been engaged in "internal strife" and had not united, set an example, took the lead in propaganda, took the lead in implementation, and took the lead in executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Indeed, they quickly promoted the local revolutionary great unity and three-in-one combination. This is a powerful proof.

This new revolutionary style is a style that Chairman Mao has always advocated, a style of Mao Zedong Thought, and a traditional style of our party. It must be forever maintained and carried forward.

    按照毛主席干部政策对待干部
    通化地区两大派克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，结合原地委书记副书记为专区革委会主任副主任
    新华社长春四日电　吉林省通化地区两大派革命群众组织，在人民解放军的帮助下，不断克服在干部问题上的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，遵照毛主席的干部政策，全面地、历史地看待干部，共同帮助原通化地委书记冯骥和副书记江卓站出来革命。冯骥和江卓在革命群众的帮助下深刻认识和检查了自己的错误，得到了广大革命群众的谅解和信任，分别被选为通化专区革命委员会主任和副主任。
        派性堵住了喉咙，
    发不出党性声音
    冯骥和江卓，在文化大革命初期都执行了资产阶级反动路线，在过去的工作中也都犯有一定的错误。因此，在文化大革命运动中，受到了革命群众的严肃批判。后来，通化地区的两大革命群众组织，对这两个干部的看法产生了分歧：通化公社认为冯骥是好干部，通化红革会则主张坚决打倒；通化红革会要扶起江卓，而通化公社又要坚决打倒。由于派性作怪，两个群众组织对这两个干部长期存在着意见分歧，成为他们打“内战”的重要原因之一。
    去年十二月末，通化地区两大派在毛主席最新指示的指引下，通过斗私批修，实现了革命的大联合。之后，他们各自按照毛主席“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法”的教导，对冯骥和江卓全面地、历史地进行了分析，认为他们虽然都犯有一定的错误，但是他们在过去的几十年中为党做了一定的工作，大节是好的，不应该把他们打倒。但是，一谈到帮助这两个干部站出来，双方的头头又顾虑重重。他们不愿承认对方保对了，自己打错了，认为这样就等于向对方认输；同时，对自己喊了一年多要“打倒”的干部，今天又要帮助他站出来，怕这样做对方会说自己打自己耳光。由于有这些顾虑，所以到了要转弯的时候，又被派性这条毒蛇缠住了。在一次协商会上，通化红革会代表原来准备对冯骥提出两个疑点，如果通化公社掌握的材料能够回答，他们就同意与通化公社一起帮助冯骥站出来。可是当他们在协商会上，听到通化公社代表对江卓一连提了八个问题，而且结语还是要“打倒”的时候，他们就想，你要打倒我们树的江卓，我也要打倒你们树的冯骥。于是他们就把自己组织原来已经否定了的对冯骥的五点意见又端了出来，当场提出七条意见，结语也是
  “打倒”。会上针尖对麦芒，各不相让。
    解放军负责同志认为，所以出现这个僵局，是派性堵住了喉咙，发不出党性的声音来。便和他们共同学习毛主席的教导：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。……这些干部和领袖懂得马克思列宁主义，有政治远见，有工作能力，富于牺牲精神，能独立解决问题，在困难中不动摇，忠心耿耿地为民族、为阶级、为党而工作。”经过学习，使他们懂得了，革命的领导干部是无产阶级的干部，是党的干部，决不是那一派、那一个山头的代表。能不能站在毛主席的革命路线上正确对待干部，是检验我们是否忠于毛主席的试金石。无产阶级革命派，必须克服在干部问题上的派性，坚决执行毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，热情帮助干部站出来革命。双方代表狠斗了私心，决心斩断缠在自己身上的派性毒蛇，正确地贯彻毛主席的干部政策，共同帮助革命的领导干部站出来，为实现革命的三结合创造条件。
        只有坚持党性原则，
    才能排除派性干扰
    正当通化红革会同意解放冯骥，通化公社同意解放江卓，双方意见逐渐趋向一致的时候，又在参加专区革命委员会的革命领导干部的名额问题上发生了分歧。通化公社中有少数负责人，感到冯骥和江卓同时站出来，一对一，还是不能说明自己这一派取得了什么“胜利”，便又提出让原地委另外一位双方有争议的领导干部参加三结合，想用二比一来胜过对方。通化公社提出这个方案后，通化红革会有人提出，他要参加，咱也再参加一个，来个“等价交换”。于是通化红革会又提出了一个双方有争论的领导干部。这样，在实现革命三结合的道路上，又碰到了新的障碍。
    针对这种争派别优势的活思想，解放军负责同志又对两派头头进行了具体帮助，同他们一起学习了毛主席的教导：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”使他们认识到，无休止地争名额，争一派优势，就会把革命三结合无限期地拖延下去，就会影响毛主席最新指示的落实。通化公社的一个常委说，争派别输赢，争名额多少的“原则”，是十足的派性原则。我们要坚决砸烂派性原则，坚持党性原则，坚持毛泽东思想的原则。通化红革会的一个常委说：在文化大革命的滚滚洪流中，我们是当革命的动力，推动革命的航船乘风破浪前进呢？还是当洪流中的暗礁，阻挡革命的航船前进？这是对我们无产阶级革命派新的考验。“等价交换”就是以派性对派性，以私对私，我们要带头挖“私”字，铲派性，推进文化大革命向前发展。
    双方认识提高以后，表示不为派性争名额，要为最快最好地落实毛主席的最新指示，推动通化地区文化大革命胜利发展作出贡献。能够先站出来的革命领导干部，就先帮助他们站出来，促进革命三结合的早日实现。至于其他还有争论的领导干部，待深入发动群众，逐步解决。于是，双方撤回了原来提出的有争议的两名干部的方案，同意推选革命的领导干部冯骥、江卓参加三结合。这样，连同过去两派早已同意了的另外两个革命的领导干部，一共有四人站了出来，这就为建立革命委员会打下了很好的基础。
          挖尽派性毒根，
      党性原则获胜
    在争领导干部席位问题上冒出来的派性被打倒了，但派性的毒根还没挖尽，在两大派协商谁担任革命委员会第一把手时，又冒出了个高低之争。通化红革会的头头们认为：我们的组织大，人数多，在领导干部席位问题上，我们做到了对等结合，如果再把我们喊了一年多要“打倒”的冯骥安上第一把手，让我们保了一年多的江卓坐偏座，那就是往我们红色造反者旗子上抹灰，说啥也不能让。通化公社的头头们想，我们把保了很长时间的冯骥推选为第一把手，把江卓摆在第二位，这不只是两个领导干部前和后的问题，而且是我们这两大派在比高低，这第一把手的位置说啥也得争。两大派各不相让，最后提出两个干部谁也别当第一把手，革委会主任请解放军的负责同志担任。解放军负责同志认为，在谁当第一把手的问题上出现的争夺战，是党性与派性斗争的继续，是“以我为核心”在新形势下的借尸还魂。不彻底铲除派性，革命三结合就不能迅速实现。于是，便组织两大派头头一起反复学习毛主席关于正确对待干部的最新指示和有关教导。两大派头头对照毛主席的教导，从会上的争位，转为挖思想上的派根。他们都主动做了自我批评，当着对方的面抖落了自己的派性老底。双方割掉了争高低的派性尾巴，一场无休止的争论停止了。他们按照毛主席提出的培养革命接班人的五项条件，全面地衡量两位革命领导干部，共同认为让冯骥担任革委会第一把手，比较合适。
    派性打倒了，冯骥当第一把手的问题解决了。两大派头头都按照毛主席的最新指示，分头做干部的思想工作，共同促进革命委员会的迅速建立。无产阶级革命派这种坚决听毛主席的话，不折不扣地按照毛主席指示办事的行动，深深感动了革命领导干部。他们一致表示要以革命派为榜样，狠触灵魂，彻底改正错误，甘当群众的小学生，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    编者按：新生的革命委员会，必须遵照毛主席的教导，树立革命的新作风，“就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风”。树立这种作风，是革命的需要，群众的需要，是革命委员会实现革命化的根本要求。
    参加河南省革命委员会第一次常委会议的常委们，在开会学习毛主席最新指示的期间，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层，使学习和实践结合起来，使领导和群众结合起来，就是树立这种革命的新作风的良好开端。
    有了这种革命的新作风，那怕工作再多，困难再大，斗争再复杂，都能够无往而不胜。河南省革命委员会常委们，亲临那些长期打“内战”、迟迟联合不起来的矿区，以身作则，带头宣传，带头落实，带头执行毛主席的最新指示，果然很快地促进了当地的革命的大联合和三结合。这就是有力的证明。
    这种革命的新作风，是毛主席一贯倡导的作风，是毛泽东思想的作风，是我党的传统作风，一定要永远保持下去，发扬光大。
