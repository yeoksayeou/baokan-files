The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam have delivered a thunderous blow to the U.S. aggressor and its entire policy of aggression against Vietnam since the beginning of the new year, pushing U.S. imperialism into an unprecedentedly awkward and serious predicament. The U.S. imperialist leaders are hurriedly plotting and scheming, attempting to stabilize their position and reverse the situation by increasing their bets and expanding the war; however, even the bourgeois media in the U.S. has to admit that the war of aggression against Vietnam is "doomed to failure."

Western newspapers recently described the plight of U.S. President Johnson, saying that, just like the initial phase of the South Vietnamese military's New Year Offensive, news of U.S. failures in Vietnam continues to pour into the White House "situation room." Johnson is sometimes "furious," sometimes "deeply saddened"; he is both "annoyed" by the continuous surprise attacks launched by the South Vietnamese military and civilians and "indignant" about the opposition he faces at home. This U.S. imperialist leader is now like a desperate gambler who wants to risk everything in a last-ditch effort to win a "clear victory" in South Vietnam to quell domestic discontent over his policy of aggression against Vietnam.

The U.S. bourgeois press acknowledges that the biggest challenge facing the Johnson administration is that its various "peace" tricks have all failed, and further escalation of the war faces numerous difficulties, primarily a severe shortage of troops. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration has driven the Soviet revisionist leadership, the British Wilson government, and the gang of accomplices led by U.N. Secretary-General Thant to launch an unprecedented "peace offensive." However, Johnson himself recently admitted in frustration that this plot to lure the enemy into surrender has once again ended in failure and cannot shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end and win final victory.

In the face of heavy casualties and a lack of defenses among U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Johnson administration has recently gone to great lengths to gather 10,500 troops from defeated soldiers in Vietnam and domestic units to "stabilize" the situation in South Vietnam. This redeployment further exposed and deepened the U.S.'s domestic manpower shortage and financial strain. According to U.S. bourgeois newspapers, the U.S. Marine Corps' strategic reserves are now "almost depleted," and the Army's reserves are also "negligible," with "not even a complete infantry division ready to be immediately deployed overseas." Therefore, Johnson has had to risk losing votes in this election year by ordering an expansion of the draft and mobilization of reserves to accelerate military buildup.

As the war in Vietnam escalates, the American people are increasingly aware that this unjust war not only represents a barbaric aggression against the Vietnamese people but also harms the vital interests of the American people. Therefore, the movement against this aggressive war within the U.S. is surging; now, the Johnson administration's attempt to drive more American youth to fight for the U.S. ruling class will inevitably provoke even stronger opposition from the American people. The Associated Press warned on March 13 that the American people's dissatisfaction with the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam "will develop into a nationwide storm."

Large-scale military buildup is also a heavy burden on the U.S. economy, which is already in crisis. It is estimated that if 100,000 more troops are sent to Vietnam, an additional $4 billion in military spending will be required. Given the current situation where the U.S. government is already heavily in debt, with fiscal deficits and balance of payments deficits increasing, financial crises worsening, and the dollar's position precarious, the severe consequences of such a large increase in spending are easy to foresee. Financial leaders in the capitalist world believe that the current unprecedented gold-buying frenzy in the world's financial markets is also occurring amidst rumors that the U.S. will further increase troops in Vietnam and that the U.S. balance of payments will continue to deteriorate.

Due to the increasingly disastrous situation in the war of aggression against Vietnam and the intensifying domestic opposition, disputes within the U.S. ruling class have become increasingly fierce, especially since the New Year Offensive by the South Vietnamese military and civilians, which has caused unprecedented turmoil within the U.S. ruling class. As the curtain rises on the U.S. presidential election, the opposition Republican Party has already begun using the recent failures in Vietnam to launch fierce attacks on Johnson to gain political capital; within Johnson's own Democratic Party, there is also a wave of complaints and accusations, with mutual blame and ridicule. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee questioned Secretary of State Rusk for more than ten hours over two consecutive days on March 11 and 12, raising a series of questions about the government's policy of aggression against Vietnam; at the same time, the House of Representatives also held a debate on the Vietnam issue, with more than 100 representatives jointly demanding "an immediate review of (U.S.) basic policy toward Southeast Asia."

Since the South Vietnamese military and civilians launched their powerful New Year Offensive, the U.S. ruling class has become even more critical and openly hostile toward the South Vietnamese puppet regime. They complain that the South Vietnamese puppet army is not only incapable of fighting but also unable to "guard the home," leading to the failure of the U.S.'s so-called "pacification plan." Democratic leader Mansfield admitted that the New Year Offensive by the South Vietnamese military and civilians shows that today, in the U.S.-puppet-controlled areas of South Vietnam, "there is no place that is safe," and the puppet regime's existence "now seems more dependent on U.S. military force than ever before." Another Democratic congressman, Grunigen, openly criticized the South Vietnamese puppet regime as "utterly useless" and pointed out that this puppet regime "has effectively collapsed." The Christian Science Monitor wrote in despair: "Since a government and a fighting army capable of survival have not been established in 12 years under U.S. protection, there is no solid reason to believe that this can be achieved in the future."

In this situation of internal and external difficulties, with no one able to find a way out for the Johnson administration, the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, the Wall Street Journal, recently published an article titled "Review and Outlook," revealing the U.S. ruling class's dilemma. The newspaper on the one hand shouted: "No matter how big the mistake of deciding to fight a ground war in Asia is, now abandoning (the war of aggression against Vietnam) would have consequences that are terrifying to think about"; but it also said that the consequences of escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam "may not be any less terrifying." Former Kennedy administration advisor Sorensen also admitted that the U.S. is now "in a dilemma" in South Vietnam: "cannot withdraw, cannot abandon, cannot negotiate, cannot win." Newsweek bluntly pointed out: "After three years of gradual escalation, Johnson's strategy on the Vietnam issue has entered a dead end."

    打也打不赢　骗也骗不成
    美帝在侵越战争死胡同中团团打转
    据新华社讯　英雄的越南南方军民新春以来给美国侵略军和整个美国侵越政策的雷霆万钧的打击，使美帝国主义陷入了空前狼狈、空前严重的困境。美帝头目正在加紧密谋策划，妄图通过增加赌注、扩大战争来稳住阵脚，挽回败局；但是，连美国资产阶级舆论也不得不承认，侵越战争“是注定了要失败的”。
    西方报刊最近在描绘美帝头目约翰逊的狼狈相时写道，象南越军民新春大捷初期的情况一样，最近美国侵越失败的消息仍然源源不断地传到白宫“情况室”，约翰逊时而“怒气冲冲”，时而“伤感不已”；他既对越南南方军民不断发起的奇袭感到“恼火”，又对在国内受到的反对表示“愤懑”。这个美帝头子现在就象一个输急了的赌徒，一心想孤注一掷地在南越战场赢得一个“明显的胜利”，来平息国内对他的侵越政策的不满。战场失利　骗局失灵
    美国资产阶级报刊承认，约翰逊政府当前面临的一个最大的难题是，它变着花样玩弄的“和谈”骗局一一失灵，而进一步搞战争“升级”又困难重重，首先是苦于兵力不足。从去年底到今年初，约翰逊政府驱使苏修领导集团、英国威尔逊政府、联合国秘书长吴丹这伙帮凶、走卒，发起了一次规模空前的“和平攻势”，但是，约翰逊自己最近也沮丧地承认，这一诱降阴谋，再次以失败告终，无法动摇越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底、争取最后胜利的坚强决心。
    在侵越美军伤亡惨重、招架无力，美国侵略军头目威斯特摩兰频频告急的情况下，约翰逊政府最近费尽九牛二虎之力，从侵越败兵和留在国内看家护院的部队中，拼凑了一万零五百人去南越“抢险”。这一调动进一步暴露和加深了美国国内兵源枯竭、捉襟见肘的窘境。据美国资产阶级报纸透露，目前，美国海军陆战队的战略后备已经“所剩无几”，而陆军的后备力量也已经“微乎其微”，“甚至没有一个完整的步兵师准备好可以立即调往海外”。因此，约翰逊不得不在今年这样一个总统选举年头，冒着丧失选票的危险，下令扩大征兵范围和动员后备役，加紧扩军。人民反战　财政困窘
    随着侵越战争的“升级”，美国人民越来越清楚地看到，进行这场不义的战争，不仅是对越南人民的野蛮侵略，同时也是损害美国人民的切身利益的。因此，在美国国内，反对这场侵略战争的运动一浪高过一浪；现在，约翰逊政府要想驱使更多的美国青年为美国统治集团去卖命，就必然会激起美国人民更加强烈的反对。美联社十三日惊呼，美国人民对约翰逊政府侵越政策的不满，“将发展成为一场全国性的风暴”。
    大规模扩军对危机四伏的美国财政经济也是一个十分沉重的负担。据估计，如果增派十万人去南越，就得增加四十亿美元的军事开支。在如今美国政府债台高筑、财政赤字和国际收支赤字激增、金融危机恶性发展、美元地位朝不保夕的情况下，再增加这样大的一笔开支，其严重后果是不难预见的。西方金融界头目认为，目前资本主义世界金融市场上刮起的空前规模的黄金抢购风潮，也是在盛传美国将进一步增兵南越、美国国际收支将继续恶化的消息时发生的。内部争吵
　空前激烈
    由于侵越战争越败越惨，国内人民反对加剧，美国统治集团内部的争吵也日益激烈，特别是新春以来，越南南方军民对美国侵略者持续的沉重的打击，在美国统治集团内部引起了一片空前激烈的吵闹。在美国总统选举的开台锣鼓打响之前，“在野”的共和党人已经在利用美国在越南战场上最近遭到的失败，对约翰逊发起猛烈攻击，为自己捞取政治资本；在约翰逊自己的民主党内，也是一片埋怨和攻讦，互相指责和嘲骂。美国参议院外交委员会在三月十一日和十二日，接连两天拉着美国国务卿腊斯克追问了十多个小时，对政府的侵越政策提出了一系列的诘问；与此同时，在众议院也就越南问题举行了一场争辩，一百多名众议员联名要求“立即研究（美国）对东南亚的基本政策”。傀儡无能　前途渺茫
    自从越南南方军民发动新春强大攻势以来，美国统治集团对南越傀儡政权的责骂也更加尖刻和公开化了。他们埋怨南越伪军不仅无力作战，连“看家”也看不了，使美国的所谓“绥靖计划”遭到破产。民主党头目曼斯菲尔德承认，南方军民新春攻势表明，今天在南越美伪统治地区，“没有一处是安全的”，傀儡政权的存在，“现在似乎比以往任何时候都更加依赖美国的军事力量”。另一个民主党议员格仑宁在不久前的一次谈话中，公开责骂南越傀儡“极不中用”，并且指出，这个傀儡政权“事实上已经崩溃”。《基督教科学箴言报》则沮丧地写道：既然“在美国的庇护下，十二年之久还没有建立起一个能够生存下去的政府和一支有战斗力的军队，今天就没有任何扎实的理由认为，今后能够作到这一点”。
    在这种内外困难交相煎迫，没有人能为约翰逊政府找到一条出路的情况下，美国垄断资本的喉舌《华尔街日报》最近发表一篇《回顾与展望》的文章，表露了美国统治集团的进退两难的窘迫心情。这家报纸一方面叫嚷：“不管决定在亚洲进行一场地面战争这个错误有多大，现在放弃（这场侵越战争），其后果是想起来都可怕的”；但是，它又说，扩大侵越战争的后果“不见得不更可怕”。前肯尼迪政府顾问索伦森也供认，美国在南越已经“陷入困境”：“走不了，放不下，谈不成，打不赢”。《新闻周刊》直截了当地指出：“在三年逐步升级之后，约翰逊在越南问题上的战略已经进入了一条死胡同。”
