Representatives of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from six military branches and two academies, who were warmly received by the great leader Chairman Mao, used numerous facts to demonstrate that the brilliant March 7 Directive is both the fundamental guideline for conducting military and political training and the educational revolution, and the fundamental guideline for carrying out the Cultural Revolution on all fronts nationwide.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 10th, representatives of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the People's Liberation Army Artillery, Armored, Engineering, Railway, Communications, Chemical Defense Forces, and the Higher Military Academy and Political Academy, enthusiastically hailed the reissuance of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. Some representatives from the frontlines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks shared their personal experiences from the past year of implementing the March 7 Directive and discussed the great significance of this programmatic document.

The representatives, filled with deep proletarian feelings, enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao for standing at the highest peak, seeing the farthest, and with the most brilliant talent and scientific foresight, making the famous strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the March 7 Directive. Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives have drawn a blueprint for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, guiding the people of the entire nation from one victory to another. Many old soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in battles during the war years and are now fighting on the frontlines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" said that a year ago, Chairman Mao issued the famous March 7 Directive, which most profoundly, thoroughly, comprehensively, and to the highest degree summarized the fundamental purpose, fundamental tasks, fundamental methods, and fundamental stance and attitude of military and political training. This is a programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a treasure for defeating various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, and the most powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With it, one will not lose direction in the midst of great storms; with it, one will overcome all difficulties.

The representatives, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, reviewed the brilliant journey of studying, propagating, implementing, and defending Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive over the past year. They used numerous facts to fully demonstrate that the brilliant March 7 Directive is both the fundamental guideline for conducting military and political training and the educational revolution, and the fundamental guideline for carrying out the Cultural Revolution on all fronts nationwide. Following Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive is victory and progress; without it, one will take detours and suffer setbacks.

In schools, implementing the March 7 Directive, revolutionary teachers and students followed Chairman Mao closely and quickly achieved the resumption of classes and the Cultural Revolution. In factories, implementing the March 7 Directive, the workers followed Chairman Mao closely and achieved double victories in revolution and production. In rural areas, implementing the March 7 Directive, poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao closely and transformed both people and the land. A representative who carried out the "support the left" task in Miyi County, Sichuan, said that at the beginning of last year, when they went to a unit to support the left, the two factions could not unite. Just at this time, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the March 7 Directive. All the support-the-left personnel and revolutionary masses studied and firmly implemented the March 7 Directive together, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity. A representative who carried out the "support agriculture" task in Heilongjiang Province said that when they went to a production brigade to support agriculture, through holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive, the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the peasant masses were greatly enhanced, achieving a grain bumper harvest that had never been seen in decades. A representative who carried out the military training task at Beijing Bajiao Middle School deeply felt that when they entered the school, due to the evil influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, there was great hostility between teachers and students and among students, affecting the resumption of classes and the Cultural Revolution. They organized teachers and students to seriously study and firmly implement the March 7 Directive, and many problems were solved.

The representatives said that the past year's struggle practice proved that to thoroughly implement the great March 7 Directive, the most important thing is to have a great heart of "liberating all mankind," seriously study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "liberating all mankind," recognize that "liberating all mankind" is the starting point and the destination of all our revolutionary work, and be able to adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, treating both factions of revolutionary masses as our class brothers. A support-the-left representative from Yumen Oilfield said that the two factions there originally had heavy factionalism and were constantly fighting each other. The support-the-left personnel did a lot of work at the beginning, but the results were not significant. Later, following Chairman Mao's great teachings on "liberating all mankind," they helped them establish the idea of "not seeking personal gain, but only for the liberation of the nation and society," and the two factions quickly achieved revolutionary great unity, uniting more than 95% of the masses and cadres.

The representatives, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force armed with weapons," deeply realized that fully implementing Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and doing a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, is the great political task of our army. Chairman Mao entrusted us with this great strategic task, which is the greatest trust, greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for us. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have a heart of "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, and grasp the March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives with a "use" attitude. With the deepest class feelings of infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, with the highest political enthusiasm and the greatest revolutionary zeal, we will launch a great wave of studying, propagating, implementing, and carrying out Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and successfully complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the great commander Chairman Mao.

　　以最饱满的政治热情落实“三·七”指示
　　用最大革命干劲完成“三支”“两军”任务
    受到伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见的六兵种两学院学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，用大量事实说明，光辉的“三·七”指示，既是搞好军政训练和教育革命的根本方针，又是全国各条战线搞好文化大革命的根本方针。
    据新华社十日讯　受到伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见的中国人民解放军炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵、铁道兵、通信兵、防化学兵、高等军事学院、政治学院学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，热烈欢呼毛主席“三·七”指示的重新发表。来自
  “三支”“两军”第一线的部分代表，结合一年来执行“三·七”指示的亲身体会，畅谈这一纲领性文件的伟大意义。
    代表们满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，纵情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席站得最高最高，看得最远最远，以最卓越的天才，最科学的预见，作了关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示。伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，绘制了夺取文化大革命全面胜利的蓝图，引导全国人民从胜利走向胜利。许多在战争年代跟随毛主席南征北战，现在又战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的老战士说，一年前，毛主席发出了著名的“三·七”指示，最精辟、最透彻、最全面、最高度地概括了军政训练的根本目的、根本任务、根本方法和根本的立场、态度，这是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文献，是战胜形形色色资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮的法宝，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最强大思想武器。掌握了它，大风浪里不迷航；掌握了它，千难万难无阻挡。
    代表们满怀革命豪情，回顾了一年来学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉历程。他们用大量的事实充分说明，光辉的“三·七”指示，既是搞好军政训练和教育革命的根本方针，又是全国各条战线搞好文化大革命的根本方针。按照毛主席的“三·七”指示办事，就是胜利，就能前进；离开了它，就走弯路，就受挫折。
    在学校落实“三·七”指示，革命师生步步紧跟毛主席，迅速实现复课闹革命；在工厂落实“三·七”指示，广大职工步步紧跟毛主席，革命、生产双胜利；在农村落实“三·七”指示，贫下中农步步紧跟毛主席，人换面貌地换装。一位在四川米易县执行支左任务的代表说，去年年初，我们到一个单位支左，两派群众联合不起来。正在这时，伟大领袖毛主席发出了“三·七”指示。我们全体支左人员和革命群众一起认真学习、坚决执行“三·七”指示，迅速地实现了革命大联合。在黑龙江省执行支农任务的代表说，我们到一个生产大队支农，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，极大地提高了农民群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，去年获得了几十年来没有过的粮食大丰收。在北京八角中学执行军训任务的代表，深有体会地说，我们进校时，由于资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，师生之间、学生之间对立情绪很大，影响了复课闹革命。我们组织师生认真学习、坚决落实“三·七”指示，许多问题都迎刃而解。
    代表们说，一年来的斗争实践证明，要彻底落实伟大的“三·七”指示，最最重要的是要有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，认真学习毛主席关于“解放全人类”的伟大教导，认识到“解放全人类”是我们一切革命工作的出发点和归宿点，就能够坚持支左不支派的原则，把两派革命群众都当成是自己的阶级兄弟。一位来自玉门油矿的支左代表说，他们那里的两派群众组织原来派性很重，“内战”不休，支左人员开始做了不少工作，都收效不大。后来按照毛主席关于“解放全人类”的伟大教导，帮助他们树立了“不谋私利，唯一的为着民族与社会的解放”的思想，两派很快实现了革命大联合，团结了百分之九十五以上的群众和干部。
    代表们按照毛主席“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”的教导，深刻地认识到，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，切实做好“三支”“两军”工作，是我军的伟大政治任务。毛主席把这个伟大的战略任务交给我们，是对我们最大的信任，最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策，我们一定要无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示狠抓一个“用”字，以对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，以最饱满的政治热情和最大的革命干劲，掀起一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻、大落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的热潮，胜利完成伟大统帅毛主席赋予我们的光荣任务。
