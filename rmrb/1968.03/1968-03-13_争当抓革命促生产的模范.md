	Strive to Be Exemplary in Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production
	People's Daily Commentator

	On March 18, 1967, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country" stated: "Comrade Mao Zedong calls on you, and the Party Central Committee calls on you, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We hope that in this great proletarian cultural revolution and under these new conditions, you will redouble your efforts, strive for the forefront, and become the most outstanding models of grasping the revolution and promoting production in the current stage of the nation's laboring masses."

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau have indeed been outstanding models in grasping the revolution and promoting production. During the great proletarian cultural revolution, they have always remained at their posts, observed labor discipline, overcome numerous difficulties, and ensured the safe power supply to our great capital, making new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution and the cause of socialist construction.

	Grasp the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness. This is the great policy formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao. Currently, the glorious task facing the entire Party, the entire army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, and the people of the entire nation is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Promoting production work is an important aspect of achieving this comprehensive victory. Therefore, revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in all industrial and mining enterprises across the country must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, redouble their efforts, strive for the forefront, and ensure that industrial and agricultural production in 1968 will have an even greater development.

	The working class is the leading force in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Revolutionary workers on all fronts must emphasize proletarian politics, enhance their sense of responsibility as masters of the state, and firmly establish a socialist work attitude. This is a reliable guarantee for doing a good job in production work. Every revolutionary worker should be like the workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, with a heart for the motherland and an eye on the world, striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives, consciously observing the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and resolutely resisting the interference of anarchist trends. They should strive for a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution and a bumper harvest in industrial and agricultural production.

	Let us, with boundless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, strive to be exemplary in grasping the revolution and promoting production!

　　争当抓革命促生产的模范
　　本报评论员
    一九六七年三月十八日，《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》里说：“毛主席号召你们，党中央号召你们，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，希望你们在这个伟大的无产阶级文化革命中，在这个新的条件下，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，成为现阶段全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范。”
    北京供电局的广大革命职工，正是抓革命促生产的出色的模范。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们始终坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，克服重重困难，保证了我们伟大祖国首都的安全供电，为无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设事业作出了新的贡献。
    抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席制定的伟大方针。当前，我们全党、全军、全国无产阶级革命派和全国人民所面临的光荣任务，是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。而抓好生产工作，正是夺取全面胜利的一个重要方面。因此，全国工矿企业的革命职工和革命干部，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，鼓足干劲，力争上游，保证一九六八年工农业生产有一个更大的发展。
    工人阶级是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量。各条战线的广大革命职工，突出无产阶级政治，提高国家主人翁的责任感，牢牢树立社会主义的劳动态度，这是搞好生产工作的可靠保证。每一个革命职工都应该象北京供电局的职工同志们那样，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，努力地活学活用毛主席的著作和最新指示，自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚决抵制无政府主义思潮的干扰，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利和工农业生产的双丰收而奋斗。
    让我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，去争当抓革命，促生产的模范吧！
