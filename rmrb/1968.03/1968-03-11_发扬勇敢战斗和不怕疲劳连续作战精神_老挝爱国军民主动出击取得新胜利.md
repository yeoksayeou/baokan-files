Upholding the Spirit of Brave Combat and Endurance, Lao Patriotic Forces Achieve New Victories

Following the capture of Nam Phao, Tat Tong, and Luanam, among other enemy strongholds, the Lao patriotic military and people have continued to demonstrate their spirit of brave combat and continuous fighting. They have taken the initiative to launch attacks and have achieved new victories.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency: On February 7, the Lao People's Liberation Army ambushed and fiercely attacked an enemy motorboat convoy on the Mekong River, 50 kilometers northwest of the capital of Luang Prabang Province. They sank two boats, damaged seven, killed 50 enemy soldiers on the boats, and wounded 14.

Following this, on February 16, local armed forces and guerrilla units in the same province attacked a bandit lair stationed in the Bamau area southwest of Nam Phao, killing nine bandits.

On February 14, the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces in Khammouane Province launched a fierce assault on enemy forces stationed in Phou Fah. After a few minutes of intense combat, the patriotic forces captured the enemy position, killing 16 enemy soldiers. Simultaneously, they shot down a helicopter that came to rescue the remaining enemy forces, killing three enemy pilots.

Since the end of January, the patriotic armed forces and guerrilla units in Xam Neua County, Xieng Khouang Province, have continuously and fiercely attacked enemy forces that have illegally occupied liberated areas, forcing the enemy to withdraw from a stronghold on January 28.

On February 14, a unit sent by the American imperialists and the reactionary regime in Vientiane to the aforementioned stronghold was bravely intercepted by local patriotic armed forces, suffering heavy casualties.

On February 5 and 6, the United States and its right-wing forces in Laos dispatched six helicopters to airdrop commandos into the liberated areas of Xieng Khouang Province. Local patriotic armed forces immediately destroyed one enemy aircraft. In the battle to annihilate the airdropped commandos, the patriotic armed forces also killed 16 enemy soldiers and seized a batch of weapons and military supplies.

According to another report from the Lower Laos People's Liberation Army Headquarters, the patriotic armed forces in Lower Laos, in January, in the battle to counter the air raids by American aggressor planes on densely populated areas along Routes 8, 9, and 12, shot down seven enemy aircraft.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency: In February, the patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province fought bravely, taking the initiative to attack the enemy and achieving many new victories.

According to incomplete statistics, the patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province killed 297 enemy soldiers in February, including 145 killed, 81 wounded, and 71 captured or surrendered; they also shot down or destroyed five enemy aircraft.

The patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province have also completely liberated important areas such as Luanam, Tat Tong, and Taveng, freeing thousands of people.

According to another report, from February 15 to 17, the patriotic military and people of Sam Neua Province carried out anti-bandit struggles in the Song Dong and Song Xien areas, eliminating 24 enemy soldiers.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Kheang Khay: The Lao "People's Liberation Army" newspaper published an article on February 28, enthusiastically hailing the recent glorious victories of the patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province in liberating Mangshan, Tat Tong, and Taveng. The article pointed out that the conspiracy of American imperialism and its lackeys to invade the Xieng Khouang Plain has failed.

The article said: American imperialism and its lackeys have been carrying out large-scale military attacks on the Xieng Khouang Plain for many years, attempting to occupy this strategic area and realize their plan to expand the war. However, the brave patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province have successively repelled all of the enemy's "incremental" attacks. From August 3, 1967, to February 2, 1968, they killed and wounded 461 enemy soldiers, shot down 14 enemy aircraft, and damaged 18.

The article pointed out that the great achievements of the patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province in Mangshan, Tat Tong, and Taveng are a heavy blow to the despicable conspiracy of the United States and its puppets, and a stern warning to the American imperialists and their lackeys: if they dare to continue their aggression against the liberated areas, the Lao patriotic military and people will give them the punishment they deserve.
