With the assistance of the support-left team from a certain air force unit of the Beijing Military Region, the Tianjin Valve Factory organized extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory, armed with Chairman Mao's latest directives, conducted self-criticism, fought against selfishness, and swept away factionalism, further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

To consolidate and expand the achievements of eliminating factionalism, the revolutionary workers of this factory held an exhibition titled "Sweeping Away Factionalism and Fully Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Directives." The factory revolutionary committee chairman, former party branch secretary Chen Xuezhang, and the leaders of the original two major factions, Liu Yonghai and Liu Shikuang, along with key members of both factions, Wu Zhenye and Liu Shizeng, spoke at the exhibition. They shared their personal experiences and angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line led by the Chinese Khrushchev, which split the ranks of the working class. They exposed the various harms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. So far, over 300,000 people in Tianjin have visited this exhibition or heard the related speeches. This exhibition has powerfully promoted the movement in Tianjin to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, organize extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, and eliminate factionalism.

The following are excerpts from the speeches of several comrades from the Tianjin Valve Factory at the exhibition.

Editor's Note: The Tianjin Valve Factory's approach of holding an exhibition titled "Sweeping Away Factionalism and Fully Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Directives" is excellent. The speeches by several comrades from this factory are a vivid and profound teaching material for overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

This teaching material specifically tells us: How the bourgeois reactionary line proposed and implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev split the working class into two irreconcilable factions, and the various serious harms that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism brought to the revolution and production. Those comrades who are still blinded by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism must wake up quickly, cut off this poisonous snake, turn division into unity, and rapidly achieve, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination.

This teaching material also tells us: Although bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism have already fallen into the vast sea of people's war, they are extremely stubborn. Under appropriate conditions, they will still manifest in various forms.

The struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a struggle between the public and the private. All comrades determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end must follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen enemy, thoroughly eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

How did our factory split into two major factions?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Why did the working class split into two factions during the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat? The facts of the Tianjin Valve Factory fully prove that this was caused by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the result of their implementing the bourgeois reactionary line.

Chen Xuezhang: When the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat began, a handful of capitalist roaders within the old Tianjin Municipal Committee, under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, implemented a thorough bourgeois reactionary line. They diverted the direction of the struggle, strictly regulating that big-character posters were not allowed on the streets, and the masses were not allowed on the streets. They even said, "The Municipal Committee is revolutionary," and "big-character posters against the Municipal Committee are not allowed." Because I was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's black "Study Notes," I had a serious slave mentality and became a mouthpiece for a handful of capitalist roaders within the old Municipal Committee, leading the proletarian cultural revolution of our factory astray from the beginning, suppressing and attacking a large number of workers and ordinary cadres, causing our factory's workers to split into two major factions.

Liu Yonghai: Indeed! The old Tianjin Municipal Committee issued a black directive to "shoot arrows in all directions," openly inciting the masses to fight against each other. In our small factory of about 170 people, half of them were considered "monsters and demons" in their eyes. After Chairman Mao published the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we established a combat organization and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line. Because we were previously oppressed, our anger was particularly intense. When posting big-character posters, we included some party members, league members, and activists. They were not convinced and immediately established a combat team, making the differences clear. During the debate on the issue of those in power, we saw that the secretary had problems, while they saw that the director had problems. Thus, one side attacked the director and protected the secretary, while the other side attacked the secretary and protected the director, and the contradictions became increasingly sharp.

Liu Shikuang: Yes! Our factory split into two factions like this. I want to add that the biggest capitalist roader within the party, in order to protect himself, incited the masses to fight against each other, creating divisions within the working class, which did not start with the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. In March 1966, I was demobilized from the military and assigned to work at the Valve Factory, just in time for the socialist education movement. I was assigned to a special case group. At that time, the "Peach Garden Experience," which was praised by the Chinese Khrushchev as "leftist in form but rightist in essence," was being implemented in this factory, persecuting the masses and ordinary cadres. As soon as I joined the special case group, I was involved in copying materials from "key individuals." While copying, I thought: There are so many problematic people in the factory. In a factory of about 170 people, there were over 90 "key individuals." This is why I did not dare to interact with the masses. This time, I regarded all the comrades who were previously persecuted as "monsters and demons" because I was deceived by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

### 我们厂是怎样分裂成为两大派组织的？

    天津市调节阀厂，在北京部队空军某部支左部队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全力围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。全厂革命职工以毛主席的最新指示为武器，本着各自多做自我批评的原则，狠斗私心，猛扫派性，进一步巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    为了巩固和扩大围剿派性的战果，这个厂的革命职工举办了“横扫派性，全面落实毛主席最新指示展览会”。厂革命委员会主任、原厂党支部书记陈学章和原两大派组织的负责人刘永海、刘士宽和两派的重要成员吴振业、刘世增，在展览会上发了言。他们现身说法，以活生生的事实，愤怒地控诉了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派推行资产阶级反动路线，分裂工人阶级队伍的滔天罪行；无情地揭露了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的种种危害。到目前为止，天津市已有三十多万人参观了这个展览会或听过了有关发言。这个展览会有力地推动了天津市全面落实毛主席最新指示、大办毛泽东思想学习班、围剿派性的群众运动。
    这里发表的是天津市调节阀厂的几个同志在展览会上的发言摘要。
    编者按：天津市调节阀厂举办“横扫派性，全面落实毛主席最新指示展览会”的做法很好。这个厂几位同志的发言，是一份打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的极其生动而深刻的活教材。
    这份活教材，具体地告诉我们：中国赫鲁晓夫提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线，怎样把工人阶级分裂成势不两立的两大派，以及资产阶级、小资产阶级派性给革命和生产带来的种种严重危害。那些尚被资产阶级、小资产阶级派性蒙住眼睛的同志，务必及早猛醒过来，斩断这条大毒蛇，化分裂为团结，迅速实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合和三结合。
    这份活教材还告诉我们：目前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，虽然已经陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中，但是，它具有十分可恶的顽固性。在适当的气候下，它还会通过各种形式反映出来。
    无产阶级党性和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争，是一场公和私的斗争。一切决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，发扬痛打落水狗的精神，把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性彻底肃清。
    我们厂是怎样分裂成为两大派组织的？
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，为什么工人阶级会分裂成为两大派呢？天津市调节阀厂的事实充分证明，这是党内一小撮走资派造成的，是他们推行资产阶级反动路线的结果。
    陈学章：无产阶级文化大革命开始，旧天津市委内的一小撮走资派，在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，推行了一条彻头彻尾的资产阶级反动路线。他们为了转移斗争大方向，严格规定大字报不准上街，群众不准上街，还说什么“市委是革命的”，“不准贴市委的大字报”。我因为受了中国赫鲁晓夫黑《修养》的毒害，有较严重的奴隶主义思想，就充当了旧市委内一小撮走资派的传话筒，把我厂刚刚开始的无产阶级文化大革命引上了邪路，压制和打击了一大批职工和一般干部，使我厂工人分成了两大派组织。
    刘永海：可不是吗！旧天津市委内一小撮走资派曾下达黑指示，要搞什么“乱箭齐发”，公开挑动群众斗群众。我们这个一百七十来人的小厂，在他们心目中，就有一半人是“牛鬼蛇神”。毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报以后，我们就成立了战斗组织，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火。由于过去我们是受压的，气特别大，在贴大字报时，把有些党团员、积极分子也挂在里边了。他们心里不服气，接着也就成立了战斗队，分歧就明朗化了。在辩论当权派问题的时候，我们看书记有问题，他们看厂长有问题。于是，一个打厂长保书记，一个打书记保厂长，矛盾越来越尖锐。
    刘士宽：对！我们厂就是这样分成两大派的。我要补充说明的是，党内最大的走资派为了保自己，他们挑动群众斗群众，在工人阶级队伍中制造分裂，不是从无产阶级文化大革命才开始的。一九六六年三月，我从部队复员到调节阀厂工作，正好赶上社会主义教育运动，就被分配到专案组。当时，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆吹捧的形“左”实右的“桃园经验”，正在这个厂推行，大整群众和一般干部。我一到专案组，正赶上抄“重点人”的材料。手里抄着，心里想着：厂里有问题的人就是多，一百七十来人的工厂，就有九十多人是“重点”。这样我就不敢和群众接触。这次我所以把过去挨整的同志，都看成是“牛鬼蛇神”，就是因为受了党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽。
