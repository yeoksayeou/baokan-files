The people of Shaoshan People's Commune, including the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They are holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes and actively carrying out revolutionary criticism, further promoting spring plowing and production.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 18 — The hometown of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao — Shaoshan People's Commune in Xiangtan County — is holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They are fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, swiftly launching a high tide of spring plowing and production.

At present, the revolutionary tide in the entire commune is surging forward. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in real life has reached a new high. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, promoting the thought revolutionization of the people, further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity, and accelerating the pace of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres are entering the current spring plowing production battle with high revolutionary enthusiasm. The 23 water conservancy projects started and repaired since last winter have been basically completed recently. Fertilizer is more abundant than last year, and green manure, after processing and cultivation, is generally better than last year. Early rice seeds are well prepared. The commune members are busy feeding the draft cattle, repairing and adding agricultural tools.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres of Shaoshan Commune, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, have become even more loving and loyal to Chairman Mao after the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After Chairman Mao issued a series of latest instructions, the commune and various production brigades immediately sprang into action, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. So far, the entire commune has held more than 20 study classes, with over 3,000 people participating in the study. Among them are poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, women, commune and brigade cadres, elderly people with white hair, and vigorous young revolutionaries. About one-fourth of the adult commune members in Shaoshan Brigade have participated in the study.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on revolutionary unity, becoming more closely united. They say: We poor and lower-middle peasants are all from the same vine, all loving Chairman Mao without limit, and resolutely walking the socialist road. Only by uniting closely can we overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of cadres in the entire commune are also struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism with the revolutionary masses, promoting thought revolutionization. Some cadres, with their own active thoughts, seriously study Chairman Mao's teaching that "because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of others pointing out our shortcomings," actively going to the revolutionary masses, checking errors, listening to criticism, and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Now, more than 95% of the cadres in the entire commune have gone to the front lines of spring plowing and production, striving to achieve new merits in revolution and production.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shaoshan Commune, using Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a stronghold, carry out revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "class struggle extinction theory," "exploitation has merits," "three selfs and one package," and "four freedoms." This greatly raises the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the proletariat. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Shaoshan Brigade, through reminiscence and comparison, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and reviewing the glorious revolutionary fighting history, are filled with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. They excitedly say: The revolutionary spark of Shaoshan was personally sowed by Chairman Mao. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the people of Shaoshan fought bravely, shed blood, and sacrificed their lives, fighting tenaciously with the people of the whole country to gain liberation and walk the socialist road. We must carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition and resolutely walk the socialist road. This commune achieved a bumper harvest last year, exceeding the grain procurement quota, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, after studying Chairman Mao's great teaching of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," recently sold more than 50,000 catties of surplus grain, supporting national construction and world revolution.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shaoshan Commune are further launching a new wave of learning from Dazhai during the spring plowing period. They take Dazhai as an example, further carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in real life, highlighting proletarian politics, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and are determined to turn Chairman Mao's hometown into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    毛主席最新指示在韶山深入人心
    韶山人民公社广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，积极开展革命大批判，进一步推动了春耕生产
    新华社长沙十八日电　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湘潭县韶山人民公社，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速掀起春耕生产的高潮。
    目前，全公社革命洪流奔腾向前，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮，毛主席的最新指示深入人心，促进了人的思想革命化，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合，加快了革命三结合的步伐。广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，以高昂的革命热情，投入当前春耕生产战斗。去冬今春全社动工兴建和整修的二十三处水利工程，已在最近基本完成。肥料比去年积得多，绿肥经过加工培育，普遍比去年长得好。早稻良种准备充足。社员们正在加紧喂好耕牛，整修和添置农具。
    富有光荣革命传统的韶山公社广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，经过无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼，更加热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席。毛主席发出一系列最新指示以后，公社和各大队立即闻风而动，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。到现在为止，全社已办学习班二十多期，有三千多人参加了学习。其中有贫下中农、民兵、妇女，有社、队干部，有白发苍苍的老人，也有朝气蓬勃的革命小将。韶山大队约有四分之一的成年社员参加了学习。
    广大贫下中农反复学习毛主席关于革命大联合的教导，团结得更加紧密了。他们说：我们贫下中农都是一根藤上结的瓜，都是无限热爱毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的。只有紧密地团结起来，才能斗倒党内一小撮走资派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。全公社的广大干部，也和革命群众一起斗私批修，促进思想革命化。有的干部带着自己的活思想，认真学习毛主席“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”的教导，主动到革命群众中去，检查错误，听取批评，改进干部和群众的关系。现在，全公社百分之九十五以上的干部，走上了春耕生产第一线，努力在革命、生产中立新功。
    韶山公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部，以毛泽东思想学习班为阵地，开展革命大批判，清除中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的
  “阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论的流毒，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。韶山大队参加毛泽东思想学习班的贫下中农和革命干部，经过回忆对比，忆苦思甜，和回顾光荣的革命战斗历程，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，激动地说：韶山的革命火种是毛主席亲自播下的。在毛主席的英明领导下，韶山人民前赴后继，流血牺牲，坚持斗争，和全国人民一起获得解放，走上了社会主义道路。我们一定要发扬革命的光荣传统，坚定不移地走社会主义道路。这个公社去年取得大丰收，已经超额完成粮食征购任务，广大贫下中农在学习班学习毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大教导以后，最近又卖出五万多斤余粮，支援国家建设和世界革命。
    目前，韶山公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，在春耕期间进一步掀起学大寨的新热潮。他们以大寨为榜样，进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，突出无产阶级政治，发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的精神，决心把毛主席的家乡办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
