**Hosting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes.**

The spring breeze sweeps across the land of our motherland, and the red sun shines over the Hetao Plain. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have bloomed like spring flowers throughout Hangjin Hou Banner in Inner Mongolia. Here, you can hear praises for Mao Zedong Thought study classes everywhere.

Poor and lower-middle peasants say: After entering the study class, Chairman Mao's latest instructions fall into our hearts, our eyes are brighter, and our strength is greater.

Revolutionary cadres say: Amidst a thousand and ten thousand things, we grasp the fundamental issue. After holding study classes, the direction is clear, the resolve is firm, work is proactive, problems are solved quickly, and the effect is the best.

**Putting Down the "Private" Burden and Shouldering the Revolutionary Responsibility**

Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the best battleground for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the study classes, cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants learned Chairman Mao's latest instructions on how to correctly treat cadres, and they were deeply moved. Some cadres who previously wanted to "put down their poles and drop their loads" were tearful, restless, overcame the idea that being a cadre is a loss, and changed their attitude of opposing the masses. They decided to put down the "private" burden and continue to shoulder the revolutionary responsibility.

Wang Houwen, the Party branch secretary of Lianfeng Production Brigade in Hongqi Commune, had once been troubled by the idea that being a cadre is a loss. In October of last year, he participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Banner Revolutionary Committee. At first, he was unwilling to reveal his thoughts. When others criticized and repudiated revisionism and shared their experiences of applying Mao Zedong Thought, he listened and felt it was good, finding it enlightening. However, he also felt that his private thoughts could not be criticized, for if he did, he would still have to be a cadre. His speeches were only about empty principles, not touching the soul.

The deeper the study, the clearer the struggle between the two lines in the countryside became, and the greater the impact on Wang Houwen's thoughts. He thought about how, in February of last year, when the local area was swept by the black wind of capitalist restoration, some brigades, under the control of a few bad elements, distributed the public welfare fund. Wasn't this the same nature as when Liu Shaoqi cut down the cooperatives? Suppressing revolutionary cadres and supporting bad elements to take power—wasn't this the same as the "Peach Garden Experience"? Wang Houwen's thoughts were in turmoil. He thought about how, as a cadre for many years, he had been bossy and detached from the masses, acting like an official towards the masses. He also thought about how, when he was just "dismissed" from his post, the old poor peasant Liu Liu sincerely told him: "You should study the middle section of the third page of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao': 'We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything.' Later, Liu Liu came to his house and said: 'Let's study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together!' When Wang Houwen finished reading the article, Liu Liu said: 'Chairman Mao teaches us that serving the people must be 'completely' and 'thoroughly.' You've only served the people for a few years. We still want to elect you as a cadre. If you don't establish new merits, how can it be done?'"

At this moment, another moving scene of class struggle reappeared before Wang Houwen: When the masses criticized Liu Zhenyang, the brigade leader of the third production team of Lianfeng Brigade, some bad elements took the opportunity to remove his post and put a controlled element in his place. The old poor peasant Hu Wenlong stood up and sternly asked: "On what grounds did you dismiss Chairman Mao's cadre and let a controlled element take the post?"

Those people weakly replied: "He is a capitalist-roader."

Hu Wenlong, upon hearing this, became even more furious and refuted: "Chairman Mao said: 'We should not only look at a cadre's one-time deed, but also at the cadre's entire history and work.' From mutual aid teams, agricultural cooperatives to people's communes, it was these cadres who led us in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. For so many years, what they said and did was all in our eyes. Who is good and who is bad, we know clearly. Liu Zhenyang has not made any big mistakes! If you talk about history, even the history of his grandfather begging and carrying loads, we know it clearly. How did he become a 'capitalist-roader'?"

Hu Wenlong rallied the poor and lower-middle peasants, resisted this reverse current, pulled down the controlled element, and supported Liu Zhenyang to take the post again.

Thinking of Chairman Mao's meticulous care and the poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiastic support, Wang Houwen felt a warm current throughout his body. He seriously criticized and repudiated revisionism, both in the study class and among the masses, and declared: "Chairman Mao tells me how to do it, and I will do it that way. The poor and lower-middle peasants tell me to do something, and I will do it."

Doing is not just putting down grievances, but reaching a new level of thought. Mao Zedong Thought has raised the awareness of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads among the vast number of grassroots cadres in rural areas. They asked themselves: If the poor and lower-middle peasants do not become cadres, who will hold the seal of the proletariat? Who will implement the Party's policies? Who will carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? They realized that who holds the leadership is a matter of power. If the country changes color, it is not a matter of whether one wants to work or not, but a matter of the lives of tens of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants. As members of the Party led by Chairman Mao, they should stand up and shoulder the revolutionary responsibility. The theory that being a cadre is a loss is a great "private" matter. They deeply felt: Carrying a heavy burden cannot travel far, and carrying a "private" burden cannot revolutionize to the end. They must criticize and repudiate the "private" matter thoroughly, and firmly safeguard the revolutionary cause.

**Uprooting the Roots of Revisionism and Cutting Off the Tail of Capitalism**

Large-scale study classes have promoted the great criticism in rural areas.

In the vast rural areas of Hangjin Hou Banner, when mentioning Liu Shaoqi, whether old or young, everyone knows he is the enemy of the working people, a bad guy sitting on the same bench with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. On the walls by the road, you can see cartoons: A person is driving a three-horse carriage, holding a plow; the carriage is on the capitalist road, and the plow is cutting off socialism. This is the poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three horses, one plow, one carriage." You can also see a person sitting on the same bench with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, drinking and eating meat. This is the poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle. ... The vast poor and lower-middle peasants are furious, verbally and in writing, condemning Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Inner Mongolia and Hangjin Hou Banner.

One good experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Hangjin Hou Banner is to combine recalling bitterness with criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The elderly recall bitterness, the middle-aged remember bitterness, and the young record bitterness, stirring up strong class feelings and voluntarily criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

Old poor peasant Liu Yingcai, in the study class, heard Liu Shaoqi's nonsense about attempting to restore capitalism, and he gnashed his teeth in anger, with old grievances and new hatreds surging up. At the age of sixteen, he fled from Gansu to the Hetao area due to famine. A family of six begged for food, and in a few days, three died of hunger. He herded sheep for the landlord, and once he lost three sheep. The landlord mounted a horse, carried a gun, and held a whip, making Liu Yingcai lead the way to find the sheep. With every step, he was whipped, and his back was skinned, with blood soaking his clothes. Liu Yingcai angrily said: "In that dark old society, the poor suffered. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who led us to stand up. The poor and lower-middle peasants best understand 'only socialism can save China.' However, Liu Shaoqi wants to implement 'four freedoms' and 'three selfs and one package,' which is a capitalist attack on socialism, aiming to destroy the collective economy of people's communes and change the color of New China. We poor and lower-middle peasants vow to walk the path of Chairman Mao and resolutely overthrow Liu Shaoqi!"

Through recalling bitterness, the vast number of commune members voluntarily criticized and repudiated revisionism. They said: "'Private' is a big root of evil, 'private' does not fall, the country is difficult to protect!" "'Private' is the root of revisionism and the tail of capitalism. We must uproot it ourselves and cut it off ourselves." "Selflessness is the right way for us poor and lower-middle peasants." In the study class, people rushed to expose their private thoughts, criticize and repudiate revisionism, making the "private" matter dirty and smelly, and they themselves did not want to touch it, and others did not want to smell it. An old man from San Daoqiao Commune Yongyue Production Brigade used to specialize in buying other people's sheep, slaughtering them, and selling mutton offal soup. He thought this was a way to make money. After criticizing and repudiating revisionism in the study class, he realized this was the capitalist road advocated by Liu Shaoqi and resolutely stopped doing it.

**A Red Sun in the Heart, Spirits High and Fighting Spirit Soaring**

In late November of last year, Hangjin Hou Banner experienced a heavy snowfall that had not been seen in decades. More than 200 production brigades in the entire banner had 10 million jin of grain buried under the snow in the fields, and food, fuel, and fodder all became problems.

At this time, the people of the entire banner remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do," and immediately organized to fight the snow disaster. Thousands of cadres and students from government agencies packed their luggage, carried sticks, and waded through knee-deep thick snow towards the countryside, fearlessly rushing to rescue grain and livestock.

The third production brigade of Guangming Brigade in Hongqi Commune had not yet threshed more than 200,000 jin of grain, which was covered by the heavy snow in the fields. At that time, the brigade cadres had not been selected, and work was temporarily unmanaged. Old poor peasant Yang Yindong returned from the study class and thought: Chairman Mao teaches us to "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness." After the heavy snow, can we not implement Chairman Mao's instructions? No, absolutely not! A heart full of infinite love for Chairman Mao and a high sense of class responsibility among the poor and lower-middle peasants prompted him to find the former deputy brigade leader and ask him to gather the commune members to discuss together. He told the commune members: "Our more than 200,000 jin of grain is covered by the heavy snow in the fields. Threshing in the ice and snow is indeed difficult, but we absolutely cannot be intimidated by difficulties. If the grain is damaged, it will harm the collective's interests and the state's interests. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.'" Everyone discussed, some saying it would take 30 days to finish, and some saying it would take 45 days. Yang Yindong said: "Everything depends on people. I, an old man, will take the lead. Let's have a general mobilization. As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words, we can conquer nature!"

Before the rooster crowed for the first time, old man Yang Yindong was already up, braving the biting cold wind, calling the commune members to work. The cold wind was like a knife cutting flesh and bone, and exhaling turned into ice flakes, but he had a red sun that never sets in his heart, his spirit was high, and his blood was boiling.

In this way, all the male and female commune members worked together, with grain drying on the roof of every house and grain roasting on the kang. In just over ten days, all the grain was threshed. The commune members received their rations, and the collective retained reserve grain, seeds, and fodder. The original procurement task for this brigade was 700,000 jin, but they delivered 160,000 jin to the state, exceeding the quota by more than one fold.

It was also at this time of heavy snow that, in the first production brigade of Hongqi Brigade, there were two sows about to give birth that needed a careful person to take care of. At that time, several people signed up, but the commune members felt they were not ideal and had not yet decided. Female commune member Xin Lan said she was willing to take care of them, but her enthusiasm did not receive a warm response. Xin Lan usually gave the impression of being lazy and good at arguing and quarreling; moreover, she had five children at home, like a ladder and a stool, with the youngest only six months old. Could she take care of them? Later, someone suggested letting her try, and if she could do it, she would continue, otherwise, someone else would take over.

The sow was about to give birth, and Xin Lan carried her six-month-old child and moved into the feeding room. The temperature was minus thirty degrees, and if not taken care of properly, the piglets would all freeze to death. She did not sleep all night, warming the piglets one by one in her room, and when the piglets needed to suckle, she carried them one by one back to the feeding room, carrying them in and out for several days. Under her careful care, the big and small pigs grew very healthy. Some people did not understand why she had such a big change. She said: "Didn't we learn in the study class? Chairman Mao didn't teach us to be selfless and dedicated to others?"

In this battle against the heavy snow and cold, cadres and commune members did not leave Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds, and their actions did not leave the examples in the "Three Articles." Finally, they overcame the snow disaster. Sixty-eight-year-old old poor peasant Chen Tianbao said well: "Where the red sun shines, there it is red. Where Mao Zedong Thought is applied, there it is effective. The poor and lower-middle peasants read Chairman Mao's books, their minds are clear, their eyes are bright, and their bones are strong."

    办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。
    毛泽东思想的春天
    ——记内蒙古杭锦后旗大办农村毛泽东思想学习班的丰硕成果
    春风吹遍祖国大地，红太阳普照河套平原，毛泽东思想学习班象春天的花朵开遍了内蒙古杭锦后旗。在这里，到处可以听到对毛泽东思想学习班的颂扬。
    贫下中农说：进了学习班，毛主席的最新指示落在心坎上，眼睛更亮堂，浑身劲更大。
    革命干部说：千头万绪抓根本，办了学习班，方向明，决心大，工作很主动，问题解决得快，效果最好。
      丢掉“私”字包袱，担起革命担子
    毛泽东思想学习班，是落实毛主席最新指示的最好的阵地。在学习班上，学习了毛主席关于要正确对待干部的最新指示，干部和贫下中农都很感动。一部分原来想“放扁担，撂挑子”的干部，热泪盈眶，坐卧不宁，克服了当干部“吃亏”的思想，改变了与群众对立的态度。他们决心放下“私”字的包袱，继续挑起革命的担子。
    红旗公社联丰大队的党支部书记王候文，就被当干部“吃亏”的思想缠住过。去年十月，他参加了旗革命委员会办的毛泽东思想学习班。起初，他不肯暴露思想。别人斗私批修，讲活学活用毛泽东思想的心得，他听了觉得好，对自己有启发。可是，他又觉得自己的私不能斗，斗了就还得当干部。发言也只讲些空道理，不触及灵魂。
    学习越深入，农村两条道路的斗争看得越清楚，王候文思想上的触动就越大。他想到去年二月当地刮资本主义复辟黑风的时候，有的队在少数坏人操纵下，把公益金给分了，这跟中国赫鲁晓夫当年大砍合作社不是一样性质吗？打击革命干部，扶持坏人上台，这不又和“桃园经验”同出一辙吗？
    王候文思想斗争很激烈。他想到自己当干部多年，指手划脚，脱离群众，对群众摆官架子。他也想到在自己刚刚被“罢官”的时候，老贫农刘六诚恳地对他说：“你要好好学习《毛主席语录》第三页中间一段：‘我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。’”后来，刘六又到他家里，对他说：“咱们学习一遍《为人民服务》吧！”等到王候文读完这篇文章，刘六接着说：“毛主席教导我们，为人民服务要
  ‘完全’‘彻底’，你才为人民服务几年嘛，我们还要选你当干部。不立新功，咋行呢？”
    这时，另一幕激动人心的阶级斗争场面又重新映入王候文的眼帘：当群众给联丰大队第三生产队队长刘振扬提意见的时候，一些坏人乘机起来撤了他的职，把一个被管制分子扶上台。老贫农胡文龙挺身而出，厉声质问：“你们凭什么把毛主席的干部罢了官，让被管制分子上台？”
    那些人有气无力地回答：“他是走资派。”
    胡文龙一听，火更大了，驳斥道：“毛主席说：‘不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作’，从互助组、农业社到公社化，都是这些干部照毛主席指引的方向领导我们走过来的。这么多年，他们说的做的，都在咱的眼里，谁好谁坏，咱清楚。刘振扬没有大错嘛！要说历史，连他爷讨饭、扛长活的历史，咱也清楚着哩。他咋就成了
  ‘走资派’呢？”胡文龙串连贫下中农，顶住了这股逆流，把被管制分子拉下马，支持刘振扬又当上了队长。
    想到毛主席无微不至的关怀，想到贫下中农热情洋溢的支持，王候文浑身象通了暖流。他认真地斗私批修，在学习班上斗，在群众中斗，并且表示：毛主席叫我怎么干，我就怎么干，贫下中农让我干什么，我就干什么。
    干，不是简单地放下委屈情绪，而是思想达到了一个新的境地。毛泽东思想使广大农村基层干部提高了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟，他们问自己：贫下中农不当干部，谁来掌无产阶级的印把子？谁来执行党的方针、政策？谁来贯彻毛主席的革命路线？他们认识到，领导权在谁手里，这就是政权问题。国家变了颜色，就不是愿不愿干的问题了，而是千百万贫下中农人头落地的问题。是毛主席领导的党员，就应该挺身而出，担起革命的担子。当干部“吃亏”论，是极大的“私”。他们深深地体会到：背着重包袱不能走长路，背着个“私”字不能革命到底。一定要把“私”字斗得臭臭的，把革命江山保得牢牢的。
    挖修正主义根子　割资本主义尾巴
    大办学习班，推动了农村革命的大批判。
    在杭锦后旗的广大农村，提到中国赫鲁晓夫，不管是老人、孩子，都知道他是劳动人民的死敌，是和地、富、反、坏、右坐在一条板凳上的坏家伙。在路旁的墙壁上，你可以看到这样的漫画：一个人赶一辆三套马车，扶着一张犁；车在资本主义道上走，犁掉的是社会主义。这是贫下中农在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三马一犁一车”的反革命修正主义路线。你还可以看到，漫画上有一个人正和地、富、反、坏、右坐在一条板凳上喝酒吃肉，这是贫下中农在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。……广大贫下中农怒气冲天，口诛笔伐，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫和他在内蒙古、杭锦后旗的代理人。
    杭锦后旗办毛泽东思想学习班的一条好经验，是把忆苦思甜同斗私批修结合起来。老年诉苦，中年忆苦，青年记苦，把阶级感情激发得浓浓的，自觉地斗私，狠狠地批修。
    老贫农刘应才，在学习班上听到中国赫鲁晓夫说的一些妄图复辟资本主义的混账话，气得咬牙切齿，旧恨新仇一齐涌上心头。他十六岁从甘肃逃荒来到河套。一家六口讨吃要饭，不几天饿死了三口。他给地主家放羊，有一次丢了三只羊，地主骑上马，背上枪，手里提着鞭子，要刘应才头前引路去找。走一步，打一鞭，打得他脊背开了花，鲜血浸透了衣裳。刘应才气愤地说：“在那个没天日的旧社会，穷人就是受罪。是伟大领袖毛主席领导我们翻了身。贫下中农最理解‘只有社会主义能够救中国’。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却要实行‘四大自由’‘三自一包’，这是资本主义向社会主义进攻，这是要破坏人民公社集体经济，使新中国改变颜色。我们贫下中农誓死要走毛主席的路，坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    通过忆苦思甜，推动了广大社员自觉地斗私。他们说：“‘私’字是个大祸根，‘私’字不倒，江山难保！”‘私’字是修正主义的根子、资本主义的尾巴，我们要自己来挖，自己来割。”“大公无私，才是咱们贫下中农的正道。”在学习班里，人们抢着亮私，斗私，把“私”字搞得又脏又臭，自己见了不想沾，别人见了不想闻。三道桥公社永跃大队有个老汉，过去专买别人的羊，宰了卖羊杂碎汤。他以为这是一门生财之道。经过在学习班里斗私批修，他认识到这是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的资本主义的道路，坚决洗手不干了。
    心里有轮红太阳　精神抖擞斗志昂
    去年十一月下旬，杭锦后旗下了一场几十年来没有过的大雪。全旗有二百个生产队的一千万斤粮食被大雪埋在场里，吃的，烧的和饲草，都成了问题。
    这时候，全旗人民牢记毛主席关于“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，立即组织起来，奋战雪灾。上千名机关干部和学生背上行李，拄着棍子，趟开没膝的厚雪扑向了农村，奋不顾身地去抢救粮食，抢救牲畜。
    红旗公社光明大队第三生产队的二十多万斤粮食还没有打下来，就被大雪盖在场里。当时，队干部还没有选出来，工作一时没人管。老贫农杨银洞从学习班回来，就想：毛主席教导我们“要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”，下了大雪，难道就可以不执行毛主席的指示吗？不能，绝对不能！一颗对毛主席无限热爱的红心，一种贫下中农的高度阶级责任感，促使他找到原来的副队长，要他把社员召集起来，一起商量商量。他对社员们说：“我们的二十多万斤粮食被大雪扣在场里，冰天雪地打场确实有困难，可我们绝不能叫困难吓倒。粮食坏了，一是损害集体的利益，二是损害国家的利益。我们要按照毛主席的教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”大家议论纷纷，有的说要三十天才能打完，有的说得用四十五天。杨银洞说：“事在人为。我老汉领个头，咱们来个全体总动员。只要听毛主席的话，就能人定胜天！”
    公鸡叫完头一遍，杨银洞老汉已经起来，冒着凛冽的寒风，招呼社员们出工。冷风象刀子似地削肉刺骨，呵气变成了冰碴，可是他心里有一轮永远不落的红太阳，精神抖擞，热血沸腾。
    就这样，全队男女社员一起动手，每家房上晒着的是粮食，炕上烤的也是粮食。只用了十来天的时间，粮食就全部打完。社员分下了口粮，集体留下了储备粮、种子、饲料。这个队原来的征购粮任务是七万斤，却送给国家十六万斤，超额一倍以上。
    也就是在这大雪封门的时刻，在红旗大队第一生产队，有两头将要生产的母猪，需要找个细心人喂养。当时，报名的有好几个，社员们觉得不理想，一时没有定下来。女社员辛兰女说她愿意喂，但她的热心却没有得到热烈的反应。辛兰女平时给人的印象是：不大勤快，又好顶嘴吵架；而且家里有梯子凳似的五个孩子，小的才六个月。她能够喂好吗？后来，有人提出让她试试看，能行就喂下去，不行另换人。
    母猪要生崽，辛兰女抱上六个月的孩子住进了饲养室。天气在零下三十度，要是照顾不好，仔猪就会全部冻死。她一夜没有睡觉，把生下的仔猪一个个抱进自己房间暖上，到仔猪吃奶的时候，又一个个抱进饲养室，抱出抱进一连好几天。在她的精心饲养下，大猪、小猪生长都很健壮。有的人不理解她为什么有这样大的变化。她说：“咱们不是在学习班里学习过了吗？毛主席不是教导我们要毫不利己专门利人吗？”
    在这场与大雪严寒的搏斗中，干部、社员思想不离毛主席的教导，行动不离“老三篇”中的榜样，终于战胜了雪灾。六十八岁的老贫农陈天宝说得好：“红太阳照到那里那里红，毛泽东思想用到那里那里灵，贫下中农读了毛主席的书，心明眼亮骨头硬。”　本报记者
