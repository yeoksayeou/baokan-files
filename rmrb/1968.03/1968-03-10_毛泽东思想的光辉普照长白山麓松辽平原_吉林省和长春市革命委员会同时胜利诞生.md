Under the loving care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Jilin Province have smashed the various plots and tricks of the class enemies, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The splendor of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the lands of Changbai Mountain and Songliao Plain. The Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City have been simultaneously and triumphantly born.

On March 6, 300,000 military and civilian personnel in Changchun held a grand rally to celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City, and to wish our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 9 — Under the radiant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Jilin Province have overcome countless difficulties and bravely fought their way to a victorious spring. Amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City were born in glory on March 6.

The birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and another triumphant song of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have always shown deep concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, like a lighthouse with a thousand rays of light, has guided the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres of Jilin Province to brave the storms and forge ahead. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and with unyielding revolutionary spirit, launched a total offensive against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jilin Province, thoroughly smashing the evil plots of a handful of capitalist roaders in Jilin Province to restore capitalism. They have taken "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie" as the key link, thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, overthrown bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, achieved revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the province.

On March 6, the capital of Jilin Province, Changchun, was immersed in the joy of a grand festival. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and military personnel from all over the province and all fronts, totaling 300,000 people, holding red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, gathered at the Geological Museum Square to solemnly celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City.

The celebration began with the orchestra playing the magnificent song "The East Is Red." When the conference solemnly announced the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the atmosphere was electric. The people, filled with deep proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Jilin Province, together with the people of the whole country, have waged a long, unyielding, and arduous struggle, completely destroying the rule of Japanese imperialism in Northeast China. During the War of Liberation, Vice Chairman Lin, a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instructions, "established a solid base in Northeast China," directly led the military and civilian personnel of Northeast China to launch three campaigns south of the river, defend Lianjiang four times, fight fiercely in Liaoshen, liberate Changchun, and achieved a great victory of strategic significance in overthrowing the reactionary government of the Kuomintang. After the liberation of the whole country, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Jilin Province, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, have worked hard and striven to achieve one glorious victory after another in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S., Japanese imperialists, and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, as well as all class enemies at home and abroad, and announced the failure of the evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jilin Province such as Zhao Lin to restore capitalism. It marks the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province into a new stage of comprehensive victory.

On this joyous day of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province, from the eastern forests to the western grasslands, from industrial cities to vast rural areas, red flags are flying everywhere, and the atmosphere is festive. The 17 million revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province, filled with revolutionary passion, look towards Beijing, the capital, and sincerely wish the great leader, our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

"Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." At this crucial moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the Jilin Military Region and the military stationed in the province have most resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, sending out batches of propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply engaging in the "three supports and two militaries" frontlines, adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, arming the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and making immortal contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province. At the celebration, the revolutionary masses, filled with passion, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Learn from the great Chinese People's Liberation Army! Salute to the great Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!"

Wang Huishang, the head of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said that the current situation in the province is extremely good, and from cities to rural areas, from factories to schools, everywhere presents a thriving revolutionary scene. "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helm, and making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." More than a year of struggle practice has made us deeply realize that all the achievements and victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are due to our great commander Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

Wang Huishang said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Winning the victory of the whole country is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous." The establishment of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee does not mean the end of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, but is the starting point of a new battle. He said that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the immediate task facing the revolutionary masses and the people of the whole province is: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, in the great criticism of the revolution, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jilin, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, criticize them down and stink them out; rely on the People's Liberation Army, rely on the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, strengthen the revolutionary unity of all nationalities; take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie" as the key link, prevent and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination; actively "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war," economize for the revolution, and quickly launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production; strengthen the sense of enemy situation, enhance revolutionary vigilance, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a good job in all aspects, and win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province.

Wang Huishang pointed out that to complete these battle tasks, the most fundamental guarantee is: to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively. The best way to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is to take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie" as the key link and vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This is a great strategic task. We must run the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better and better, create new levels and new experiences.

Wang Huishang said, Jilin Province and Changchun City were once the stronghold of the Japanese invaders and the puppet Manchukuo, and class struggle is very sharp. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, "Never forget class struggle," and increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Wang Huishang finally called on the revolutionary masses and the people of the whole province not to disappoint the expectations of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Party Central Committee, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn Jilin Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The responsible comrade of the 731 Unit stationed in Changchun, Ma Ning, spoke on behalf of the Jilin Military Region and the broad cadres and soldiers stationed in the province at the meeting, expressing the warmest congratulations on the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City. He said, we, the People's Liberation Army, are the strong pillars of proletarian dictatorship. Defending the Revolutionary Committee is our glorious mission. The Jilin Military Region and the cadres and soldiers of all units stationed in the province will resolutely support, wholeheartedly help, and bravely defend the newly born Revolutionary Committee, strike and suppress all class enemies who sabotage the Revolutionary Committee and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strengthen and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. He said that in the future, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," and do a better job in the "three supports and two militaries" work.

The vice head of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary cadre Yuan Bo, and the head of the Changchun City Revolutionary Committee, Ren Qingyuan, also spoke at the meeting.

The representatives of the Changchun City Great Alliance Committee, representatives from various regions, and representatives of various ethnic groups from Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, unanimously expressed at the meeting that they would definitely, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie," fight against the "self," establish the "public," resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, resolutely overcome anarchism, and consciously enhance proletarian party spirit. They must strengthen military-civilian unity and unity among all ethnic groups. They must carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jilin Province, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The vice heads of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Zheng Jiaoqiao, Xiao Daosheng, and He Youfa, the vice heads of the Changchun City Revolutionary Committee, Liu Jincai, Li Chengke, Zhai Xiangkun, and Zhou Xuan, the responsible comrades of the Jilin Military Region and the military stationed in Jilin Province, as well as the members of the Provincial and Municipal Revolutionary Committees, participated in the celebration.

The meeting, amidst the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" passed a telegram of respect to our great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand parade was held to celebrate.

    三月六日，吉林省省会长春市沉浸在盛大节日的欢乐之中。来自全省各地各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和驻军指战员共三十万人，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，簇拥着毛主席巨幅画像，汇集到地质宫广场，隆重庆祝吉林省革命委员会和长春市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在乐队高奏《东方红》的雄壮歌声中开始。当大会庄严宣告吉林省革命委员会和长春市革命委员会光荣诞生时，全场欢声雷动，群情沸腾。人们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，吉林省各族革命人民同全国人民一起，进行了长期的不屈不挠的艰苦斗争，彻底摧毁了日本帝国主义在东北的统治。解放战争时期，毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，遵照毛主席的伟大指示，“建立巩固的东北根据地”，直接率领东北军民，三下江南，四保临江，鏖战辽沈，解放长春，取得了推翻国民党反动政府具有战略意义的伟大胜利。全国解放以后，吉林省各族革命人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。
    吉林省革命委员会和长春市革命委员会的胜利诞生，给美、日帝国主义和苏修领导集团及国内外一切阶级敌人以沉重的打击，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在吉林省的代理人赵林之流复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋的破产，标志着吉林省的无产阶级文化大革命进入了夺取全面胜利的新阶段。
    在欢庆吉林省革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，从东部的林海到西部的草原，从工业城市到广阔农村，到处红旗招展，喜气洋洋。全省一千七百万各族革命人民满怀革命激情，遥望首都北京，最衷心地祝愿伟大领袖、我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的关键时刻，吉林省军区和全省驻军最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，派出大批毛泽东思想宣传队，深入“三支”“两军”第一线，坚持支左不支派的原则，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，帮助他们全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在吉林省无产阶级文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋。在庆祝大会上，广大革命群众满怀激情，不断振臂高呼：“向伟大的中国人民解放军学习！”“向伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”吉林省革命委员会主任王淮湘同志在会上讲了话。他说，当前全省形势空前大好，从城市到农村，从工厂到学校，到处呈现一派蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”一年多的斗争实践，使我们深深地体会到，无产阶级文化大革命所取得的一切成就，一切胜利，都归功于我们伟大的统帅毛主席，归功于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    王淮湘同志说，毛主席教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”吉林省革命委员会的成立，绝不意味着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的结束，而是新的战斗的起点。他说，革命委员会成立以后，摆在全省无产阶级革命派和全省人民面前的战斗任务是：更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线，在革命的大批判中，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在吉林的代理人批深批透，批倒批臭；坚决依靠人民解放军，依靠广大革命群众和革命干部，加强各民族的革命团结；以“斗私，批修”为纲，防止和克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合；积极“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，节约闹革命，迅速掀起工农业生产新高潮；加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，做好各项工作，夺取吉林省无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    王淮湘同志指出，要完成这些战斗任务，最根本的保证是：条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。落实毛主席最新指示的最好办法，就是以“斗私，批修”为纲，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。这是伟大的战略任务。一定要把毛泽东思想学习班办得好上加好，办出新水平，创出新经验。
    王淮湘同志说，吉林省、长春市曾经是日寇伪满的统治中心，阶级斗争十分尖锐。我们要牢记毛主席
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍地提高革命警惕性，大力加强无产阶级专政，保证无产阶级文化大革命顺利进行。
    王淮湘同志最后号召全省无产阶级革命派和全省人民要不辜负毛主席、林副主席、党中央的殷切期望，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把吉林省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    驻长春七三一一部队负责人马宁同志代表吉林省军区和驻军广大指战员在会上讲话，对吉林省革命委员会和长春市革命委员会的成立，表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。捍卫革命委员会是我们光荣的使命。我们吉林省军区和驻全省部队指战员，坚决拥护、全力支持、热情帮助、英勇保卫新诞生的革命委员会，打击和镇压一切破坏革命委员会、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人，大力加强和巩固无产阶级专政。他表示，今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。
