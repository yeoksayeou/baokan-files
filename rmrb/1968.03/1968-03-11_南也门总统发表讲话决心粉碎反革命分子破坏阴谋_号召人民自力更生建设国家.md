According to Xinhua News Agency, Aden, March 8th: South Yemen People's Republic President Qahtan al-Shaabi delivered a speech on the evening of March 8th on Aden Radio, calling on the people of South Yemen to build the nation through self-reliance. He also expressed his determination to crush the sabotage plots of counter-revolutionary elements.

President Shaabi said: We have already forced colonialism to leave our country permanently and freed our country from the rule of the colonialist puppets, the Sultan (former rulers of the South Arabian Federation). However, this does not mean the end of the revolution.

He said: We must rely on our own strength and work together to build the nation. He emphasized that the people of South Yemen are capable of handling all the problems left over by colonialism. In his speech, President Shaabi pointed out that some counter-revolutionary elements are engaged in sabotage activities in South Yemen. He refuted the rumors spread by the counter-revolutionaries. He said: The National Liberation Front of South Yemen is today more united and stronger than ever before. Some counter-revolutionary groups are attempting to sabotage our republic from within, but we are prepared for them, and we are determined to crush them.
