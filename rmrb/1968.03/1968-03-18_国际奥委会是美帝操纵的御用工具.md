More than thirty African countries have decided to boycott the 19th Olympic Games scheduled to be held in Mexico this October, in protest against the illegal decision by the International Olympic Committee, manipulated by U.S. imperialism, to allow South Africa, which practices racial discrimination, to participate in the Games. The just action taken by the African countries is a stern denunciation of U.S. imperialism and its puppet, the International Olympic Committee, and a blow to the plot of U.S. imperialism to sabotage the struggle of African countries against South African racism. The Chinese people firmly support the just stand taken by the African countries.

For many years, the International Olympic Committee, under the control of the U.S. imperialist element Avery Brundage, has, under the pretext of "sports should be separate from politics," served the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism, doing many evil deeds. It has followed the dictates of U.S. imperialism, hostile to China, rudely interfered in China's internal affairs, and pursued the plot of creating "two Chinas." It has monopolized international sports activities, manipulated international sports organizations, obstructed the independent and autonomous development of sports in Asian and African countries, and excluded and suppressed the rights of Asian and African countries to participate in international sports activities, splitting and sabotaging the united anti-imperialist sports activities of Asian and African countries. Now, under the direction of the U.S. imperialist element Avery Brundage, the International Olympic Committee has once again admitted the notorious South African racists into the Olympic Games.

In this matter, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has played a despicable two-faced role. After the International Olympic Committee made the illegal decision to invite South Africa, the Soviet revisionist clique directed its representative at the International Amateur Athletics Federation to express support for it. When it saw that the illegal decision of the International Olympic Committee aroused the indignation of African countries, it hypocritically issued a statement demanding that the International Olympic Committee change its original decision. However, the Soviet revisionist clique did not take any practical actions to support the African countries' boycott of the Olympic Games. This fully exposed the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist clique betraying the African people. In fact, people are well aware that in international sports activities, the Soviet revisionist clique has always colluded with U.S. imperialism, sabotaged the united anti-imperialist sports cause of Asia and Africa, and attempted to bring the sports cause of Asian and African countries into the orbit of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," thereby placing the sports movements of Asian and African countries under the monopoly and manipulation of the United States and the Soviet Union. The people of Asian and African countries should maintain a high degree of vigilance against such criminal activities of the Soviet revisionists.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The jackals of imperialism should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily dispose of the fate of mankind and carve up Asian and African countries at will has gone forever." The people of Asian and African countries have the full right and strength to independently and autonomously develop their own sports cause. The people of Asian and African countries, united as one, relying on their own strength, can build an anti-imperialist sports team and certainly can flourish the sports movements of Asian and African countries and serve the anti-imperialist struggle. The revolutionary torrent of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples is irresistible by any force.

　　国际奥委会是美帝操纵的御用工具
　　本报评论员
    非洲三十多个国家决定抵制今年十月在墨西哥举行的第十九届奥林匹克运动会，以抗议美帝国主义操纵下的国际奥林匹克委员会非法决定让实行种族歧视政策的南非参加这届奥运会。非洲国家的正义行动，是对美帝国主义及其御用工具国际奥委会的严正声讨，是对美帝国主义破坏非洲国家反对南非种族主义斗争的阴谋的一个打击。中国人民坚决支持非洲国家的这种正义立场。
    多年来，国际奥委会在美帝国主义分子布伦戴奇的操纵下，打着“体育应当同政治分开”的幌子，替美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策服务，干了许多坏事。它秉承美帝国主义的意旨，敌视中国，粗暴干涉中国内政，推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。它垄断国际体育活动，操纵国际体育组织，阻挠亚非各国独立自主地发展体育事业，排斥和打击亚非国家参加国际体育活动的权利，分裂和破坏亚非国家团结反帝的体育活动。现在，国际奥委会在美帝国主义分子布伦戴奇的策划下，再次把臭名昭著的南非种族主义者塞进奥运会。
    在这件事情上，苏修叛徒集团扮演了两面派的卑鄙角色。在国际奥委会作出邀请南非的非法决定后，苏修集团竟指使其驻国际业余田径联合会的代表对此表示支持。当它看到国际奥委会的非法决定激起非洲国家的公愤，又假惺惺地发表声明要求国际奥委会改变原议。然而苏修集团并不采取实际行动来支持非洲国家对奥运会的抵制。这充分暴露了苏修集团背叛非洲人民的丑恶面目。其实，人们很清楚，在国际体育活动中，苏修集团一贯同美帝勾结，破坏亚非团结反帝体育事业，企图把亚非各国的体育事业纳入“美苏合作主宰世界”的轨道，从而把亚非各国的体育运动置于美苏两国的垄断和操纵之下。对于苏修的这种罪恶活动，亚非各国人民应当保持高度的警惕。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”亚非各国人民，完全有权利，也有力量独立自主地发展自己的体育事业。亚非各国人民团结一致，依靠自己的力量，建立一支反帝的体育队伍，就一定能够繁荣亚非各国的体育运动，为反帝斗争服务。亚非人民反帝斗争的革命洪流，是任何力量都阻挡不了的。
