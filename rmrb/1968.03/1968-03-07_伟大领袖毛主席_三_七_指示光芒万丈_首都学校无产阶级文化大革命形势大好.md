Over the past year, the People's Liberation Army, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, has conducted military and political training for over a million people in 385 middle schools, 834 primary schools, and some universities in the capital. Through this training, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have greatly heightened their proletarian consciousness, and have become even more deeply devoted to the great leader and teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and to the great thought of Mao Zedong. They have become more conscious in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Currently, all schools have established an unshakable daily reading system, formed groups for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and produced tens of thousands of active participants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The trained middle and primary schools have all achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, released more than 80% of revolutionary cadres, and established revolutionary committees in 98% of the schools, ushering in a high tide of proletarian educational revolution.

According to a report from the *Beijing Daily*: Over the past year, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army executing military training tasks in the capital have steadfastly advanced along the navigational course opened by the great leader Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, creating outstanding achievements for the capital's proletarian cultural revolution, and making the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital's schools appear in an unprecedentedly excellent situation.

The various military branches, military services, and Beijing troops of the People's Liberation Army have actively responded to the great battle call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao to send military personnel to train revolutionary teachers and students. Under the unified organization and leadership of the Military Training Command of the Beijing Garrison, they have conducted military and political training for over a million people in 385 middle schools, 834 primary schools, and some universities in the capital. Over the past year, the military training troops, in accordance with Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, have actively participated in the work of opening schools, reorganizing, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and implementing struggle, criticism, and reform. They have vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought, conducted extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, fundamentally changing the political landscape of the capital's schools. As Chairman Mao said, "Training makes a big difference." Through military and political training, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have greatly heightened their proletarian consciousness, and have become even more deeply devoted to the great leader and teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and to the great thought of Mao Zedong. They have become more conscious in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The trained middle and primary schools have all achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, released more than 80% of revolutionary cadres, and established revolutionary committees in 98% of the schools, ushering in a high tide of proletarian educational revolution.

The military training troops, with boundless proletarian feelings of love, faith, reverence, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, have united and led the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. In the sharp struggle between the two lines, they have overcome numerous obstacles and eliminated interference from the right or ultra-left, implementing and bravely defending Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, achieving one victory after another.

Last March, when the military training troops were extensively and deeply promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and helping the broad revolutionary teachers and students to launch a high tide of revolutionary great unity, they were struck by the reactionary tide of anarchism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, which blew a "demolition wind," causing the revolutionary ranks of the middle schools to split into two factions. In August, some misled masses, under the deception and incitement of class enemies, also obstructed the military and political training.

Facing the sharp and complex class struggle, all the soldiers and officers of the military training troops, with the issues from the struggle, repeatedly and seriously studied the March 7th directive, enthusiastically promoted the March 7th directive, and vowed to complete the military and political training tasks given by Chairman Mao, regardless of wind and waves. When the military training team of Shijingshan Middle School and the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff were struck, they swore to Chairman Mao: "The sky may collapse, the earth may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change; our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Chairman Mao's March 7th directive will never be abandoned," defending the March 7th directive with actual actions to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

After entering the schools, the military training troops, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," led the broad revolutionary teachers and students to launch a great exposure and criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev, heightening the proletarian and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and greatly arousing their class hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev.

The military training troops conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and scientific analysis of the two major factions that appeared in various schools. They believed that the two factions in the middle schools were both proletarian revolutionary factions that had emerged from the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, and there was no fundamental conflict of interests between the two factions. The military training troops insisted on the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, conducting thorough and detailed ideological and political work among the broad masses of the two factions. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "as long as the two factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles," taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, helping the two factions to conduct extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fiercely struggle against selfishness, sweep away factionalism, enhance party spirit, and eliminate all big and small factions, achieving revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes in all middle schools in the city. The military training troops also helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students in primary schools to launch revolutionary great criticism and achieve revolutionary great unity based on classes. Additionally, they helped higher education institutions to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes and launch a "people's war" to besiege bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Currently, a batch of higher education institutions have achieved revolutionary great unity. Other higher education institutions, with the help of the military training troops, are also catching up quickly.

A key issue in implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th directive is to carry out the revolutionary three-in-one combination, allowing a large number of revolutionary cadres to step forward and shoulder the revolutionary burden.

On one hand, the military training troops used Mao Zedong Thought to educate the cadres, helping them to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the masses' struggle, consciously revolutionize, deeply touch their souls, thoroughly examine and correct their mistakes, and put down their burdens to revolutionize; on the other hand, following Chairman Mao's teaching: "Persuade the students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself," they helped the teachers and students to implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres, and warmly welcome the revolutionary cadres to shoulder the revolutionary burden. Schools such as Shijingshan Middle School, Caochangdi Middle School, Yugezhuang Middle School, Women's No. 7 Middle School, No. 60 Middle School, and Changxindian Town Central Primary School, with the help of the military training troops, have relatively well handled the issue of releasing and using cadres, fully displaying the tremendous power of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, making the school's revolutionary movement vigorous and progressing rapidly.

To carry out Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in schools, it is necessary to resume classes and make revolution. The military training troops repeatedly promoted to the revolutionary teachers and students the great significance of Chairman Mao's proposal to resume classes and make revolution, conducted in-depth ideological and political work, eliminated the interference of anarchism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, withstood wave after wave of "stop-class winds," and launched a proletarian educational revolution. The military training troops helped the revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers to use Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts as weapons, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the character 'break' comes first, and 'establish' is within it," to launch a revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, enhancing their determination to carry the revolution through to the end. On this basis, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "practice, cognition, more practice, more cognition," insisting on teaching while reforming, summarizing while improving, and timely promoting some schools' initial experiences in educational revolution. After a period of struggle practice, currently, the middle schools have, in the educational system, explored and established grade committees composed of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres, highlighting proletarian politics, and reversing the past revisionist "business first" bourgeois direction; in teaching methods, conducted democratic teaching, changing the "stuffing" method to the "inductive" method, with teachers and students on the same platform, teaching and learning from each other, improving teaching quality; in teaching content, thoroughly criticized the black goods of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism, thoroughly established Mao Zedong Thought, with Mao Zedong's works as the basic textbooks for liberal arts and Mao Zedong Thought as the commander for sciences.

The military training troops, following Comrade Lin Biao's series of important directives on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, conducted extensive education among the revolutionary teachers and students on being "loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line," and "having boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao." They exposed and denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and other top walk-capitalist clique within the party in fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought; invited model heroes from the troops to introduce their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and achieving ideological revolutionization. The military training troops took the lead in exposing and struggling against their own selfishness, everywhere promoting and carrying forward the good traditions and styles of the Liberation Army, guiding the revolutionary teachers and students to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and establish a revolutionary learning style. They also, aiming at the characteristics of teenagers' eagerness to learn and progress, launched activities such as creating four goods, striving for five goods, one helps one, and one pair of reds, vigorously praising good people and good deeds.

After one year of military and political training, the political atmosphere of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the schools has reached an unprecedented height, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff's self-consciousness in learning has greatly improved, daily reading study systems have been universally established, groups for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have been formed, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been extensively conducted, and tens of thousands of active participants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have emerged. Various districts have universally convened conferences of representatives of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works among revolutionary teachers and students.

Chairman Mao taught: "To turn the party's line into the masses' line, we need our long-term, unyielding, arduous, and patient efforts that are not afraid of troubles. Without such efforts, nothing will succeed." After one year of struggle practice, it has been proven that the troops executing military training tasks in the capital have modelly implemented Chairman Mao's teaching. The broad soldiers and officers are determined to even higher hold up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive even harder, and struggle for further comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's March 7th directive.

    伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示光芒万丈
    首都学校无产阶级文化大革命形势大好
    一年来，人民解放军遵循毛主席的伟大教导，对首都三百八十五所中学、八百三十四所小学和部分大学共一百多万人进行了军政训练。广大革命师生经过军政训练，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟，更加无限热爱无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。目前，各学校普遍建立了雷打不动的天天读学习制度，建立了活学活用毛主席著作小组，涌现出成千上万的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。所训练的中小学，已经全部实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，解放了百分之八十以上的革命干部，百分之九十八的学校建立了革命委员会，掀起了无产阶级教育革命的高潮。
    据《北京日报》报道：在首都执行军政训练任务的人民解放军指战员们，一年来，坚定不移地沿着伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示开辟的航道胜利前进，为首都的无产阶级文化大革命创建了卓越的功勋，使首都学校的无产阶级文化大革命出现了空前大好的形势。
    人民解放军各军种、兵种和北京部队，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席发出的派军队干部训练革命师生的伟大战斗号召，派出大批指战员，在北京卫戍区军训总指挥部统一组织领导下，对首都三百八十五所中学、八百三十四所小学和部分大学共一百多万人进行了军政训练。一年来，军训部队遵照毛主席的“三·七”指示，积极“参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作”，大力宣传毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，使首都学校的政治面貌发生了根本的变化，确实象伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“训练一下和不训练大不一样。”广大革命师生经过军政训练，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟，更加无限热爱无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。所训练的中小学，已经全部实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，解放了百分之八十以上的革命干部，百分之九十八的学校建立了革命委员会，掀起了无产阶级教育革命的高潮。坚决贯彻、英勇捍卫“三·七”指示
    军训部队怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，团结和带领广大革命师生员工，在两条路线的尖锐斗争中，战胜重重阻力，排除了来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰，贯彻执行和英勇捍卫了毛主席的“三·七”指示，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    去年三月，正当军训部队广泛深入地宣传贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示，帮助广大革命师生掀起革命大联合的高潮时，受到无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动思潮的冲击，刮起了一阵“拆台风”，使中学的无产阶级革命派队伍分裂成为两派。八月，一些不明真相的群众在阶级敌人蒙蔽和煽动下，又去阻挠军政训练。
    面对尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，军训部队全体指战员带着斗争中的问题，反复地认真学习“三·七”指示，热情宣传“三·七”指示，不管风吹浪打，誓死完成毛主席交给的军政训练任务。石景山中学军训团和广大革命师生员工在受到冲击的时候，他们向毛主席宣誓：“天可塌，地可崩，忠于毛主席的红心永不变”；“头可断，血可流，毛主席的‘三·七’指示不可丢”，以巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合的实际行动捍卫了“三·七”指示。帮助师生实现以教学班为基础的革命大联合
    军训部队进入学校后，遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，带领广大革命师生展开了对中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线的大揭发、大批判，提高了革命师生员工的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，大大激发了他们对中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级仇恨。
    军训部队对各校出现的两大派对立情况，作了全面的、深入的科学分析。他们认为，中学的两派，都是同资产阶级反动路线斗争中冲杀出来的无产阶级革命派，两派之间没有根本的利害冲突。军训部队坚持支左不支派的原则，对两派广大群众开展深入细致的思想政治工作。他们遵照毛主席“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”的教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助两派大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗私心，横扫派性，增强党性，铲除了大大小小的山头，使全市中学全部实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。军训部队也帮助小学广大革命师生开展了革命大批判，实现了按班级的革命大联合。另外，帮助大专院校举办毛泽东思想学习班，发动围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”。目前，已经有一批大专院校实现了革命大联合。其他的大专院校在军训部队帮助下，也正在急起直追。帮助大批革命干部站出来挑起革命重担
    落实毛主席“三·七”指示的一个关键问题，是实行革命三结合，让大批革命领导干部站出来挑起革命重担。
    军训部队一方面用毛泽东思想教育干部，帮助他们到群众斗争中去活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉革命，狠触灵魂，彻底检查和改正错误，放下包袱干革命；一方面遵照毛主席的指示：“说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”，帮助师生贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，相信和依靠干部的大多数，热忱地欢迎革命干部挑起革命重担。石景山中学、草场地中学、岳各庄中学、女七中、六十中、长辛店镇中心小学等学校，都是在军训部队帮助下，比较好地处理了解放和使用干部的问题，发挥了革命三结合的巨大威力，使学校的革命运动生气勃勃，进展很快。紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚持复课闹革命
    复课闹革命，是落实毛主席“三·七”指示，夺取学校无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的必由之路。军训部队向革命师生反复宣传毛主席提出的复课闹革命的伟大意义，深入开展思想政治工作，排除无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的干扰，顶住了一次又一次的“停课风”，大搞无产阶级教育革命。军训部队帮助革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人，以毛主席教育革命思想为武器，依照毛主席“破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线展开了革命的大批判，增强了将革命进行到底的决心。在这基础上，又遵循毛主席“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导，坚持边教学，边改革，边总结，边提高，及时推广了一些学校的教育革命的初步经验。经过一段斗争实践，目前，中学已经在教育体制上摸索建立了有革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人、革命的干部共同组成的年级委员会，突出了无产阶级政治，扭转了过去修正主义“业务第一”的资产阶级方向；在教学方法上，进行民主教学，把“填鸭式”改成“启发式”，师生同上讲台，互教互学，提高了教学质量；在教学内容上，大破封、资、修黑货，大立毛泽东思想，文科以毛主席著作为基本教材，理科以毛泽东思想作统帅。狠抓根本，在教育阵地
  大立毛泽东思想
    军训部队遵照林副主席关于活学活用毛泽东思想的一系列重要指示，在革命师生中普遍进行了“忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线”，“对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚”的教育，揭发、控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派疯狂反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行；请部队英雄模范人物介绍活学活用毛泽东思想，实现思想革命化的经验。军训部队带头亮私斗私，处处传、带解放军的好传统、好作风，引导革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，树立革命好学风。他们还针对青少年好学上进的特点，开展创四好，争五好，一帮一、一对红的活动，大力表扬好人好事。
    经过一年军政训练，学校里活学活用毛泽东思想的政治空气空前高涨，革命师生员工学习自觉性大大提高，普遍建立了雷打不动的天天读的学习制度，建立了活学活用毛主席著作小组，大办了毛泽东思想学习班，涌现出成千上万的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。各区普遍召开了革命师生学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。
    毛主席教导说：“把党的方针变为群众的方针，还须要我们长期坚持的、百折不挠的、艰苦卓绝的、耐心而不怕麻烦的努力。没有这样一种努力是一切都不成功的。”经过一年斗争实践的考验，证明在首都执行军训任务的部队，是模范地执行了毛主席这一教导的。广大指战员决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，为进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示而奋斗。
