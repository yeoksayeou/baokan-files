In the busy spring ploughing season, can Mao Zedong Thought study classes in rural areas be conducted well? The experience of Dazhai Commune provides an affirmative answer.

To win the battle of spring production this year, there are countless ways, but implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and emphasizing proletarian politics is the first priority. Persisting in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and leading with Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental way to ensure a good spring ploughing.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental task of political work is to constantly instill socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." Mao Zedong Thought study classes are an excellent way to instill socialist ideology and criticize capitalist tendencies.

Dazhai Commune has provided good experience in conducting study classes during the busy farming season. They have adapted to the situation and ensured that political work is carried out continuously. This experience is worth learning from. —Editor

Conducting Spring Ploughing Study Classes Well and Mobilizing Enthusiasm for Spring Ploughing

Dazhai Commune, in accordance with the busy spring ploughing situation, has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, changing from large-scale to small-scale, and from centralized to decentralized, with good results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, since last December, the various brigades in Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have successively opened various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes totaling 67, with more than 7,000 people participating. This has greatly promoted the thought revolution of cadres and the masses, and has powerfully advanced winter agricultural water conservancy construction and preparation for spring ploughing.

With the start of the busy spring ploughing season, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by various brigades have encountered new contradictions:

1. Winter agricultural work is concentrated, and the time for workers to start and finish work is relatively uniform, making it convenient for concentrated study; now, with the increase in tilling, fertilizing, transporting fertilizer, and ploughing, it is difficult for workers to start and finish work at the same time, making concentrated study very inconvenient.
2. Winter has short days and long nights, making it convenient to study at night; after spring arrives, the days are long and the nights are short, and the labor intensity of cadres and workers increases, making night study affect daytime production.
3. During the busy season, study time is short, and only a few people can speak, affecting everyone's participation in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.
4. Cadres and workers are all in the fields, and active thoughts also arise in the fields, making it impossible for study classes held in rooms to solve problems in a timely manner.

How to solve these new contradictions? The leaders of Dazhai Commune, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "the situation is constantly changing, and to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study," learned from Dazhai Brigade. The cadres and workers of Dazhai Brigade said: "During the busy spring ploughing season, the busier we are, the more we must seize the time to study Mao Zedong Thought and conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes well." They moved the study classes to the fields and dining halls, insisting on studying every day and using what they learned in everything.

Dazhai Commune learned from the experience of Dazhai Brigade and called on the entire commune to learn from Dazhai and conduct busy season study classes.

Various brigades, based on actual conditions, followed the spirit of "changing large-scale to small-scale, centralized to decentralized, comprehensive study to piecemeal study, long time to short time, cadres and masses studying together," moved the study classes to the fields, dining halls, and courtyards of the workers' homes, and divided the study classes held by the brigades into work teams, livestock teams, and sideline teams. In this way, the number of study classes in the entire commune increased from the original 67 to 206.

After the forms of the study classes changed with the busy farming season, the leadership of the commune and brigades over the study classes was not relaxed but tightened even more. They mainly focused on four aspects:

1. The party branch strengthened unified leadership, cadres took the lead to go to the production front line, divided responsibilities to lead, and worked, studied, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together with the workers.
2. Organized instructors to go to the fields, dining halls, and courtyards for piece-by-piece guidance. Organized party members, league members, and activists to play a leading, backbone, and bridging role among the masses.
3. Continuously summarized and exchanged the achievements and experiences of various types of study classes. Each brigade organized a piece-by-piece reporting meeting every seven days and a full brigade reporting meeting every half month, evaluated advanced units, and set up models.
4. The study content was concise and targeted, the study time was short and flexible. The study classes took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, focused on studying the "Old Three Articles," and combined them with the central tasks. Using one of Chairman Mao's sayings, they criticized one reactionary point of the Chinese Khrushchev; using one of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they solved one active thought; using one of Chairman Mao's articles, they solved one practical problem. They learned a little and used it immediately, with visible results.

The busy season study classes in Dazhai Commune have achieved good results. First, the study classes are diverse, flexible, and cover a wide range, with many participants. Second, the study classes are conducted on the production front line, making it more convenient to combine learning with practice, learn what is urgently needed, and see immediate results. Third, it has promoted the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, with everyone participating in the criticism, thoroughly eliminating the various revisionist poisons spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in rural areas. Fourth, conducting study classes on the work site makes it convenient to address active thoughts, timely compare with Chairman Mao's works, and solve problems with targeted measures. Fifth, it has promoted cadres' participation in collective production, strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and enhanced unity among cadres and between cadres and the masses.

Now, the busy season study classes in Dazhai Commune of Xiyang County are becoming better and better, powerfully promoting the thought revolution of cadres and workers, and powerfully promoting spring ploughing production.

    在春耕大忙季节，农村的毛泽东思想学习班能不能坚持办好？大寨公社的经验作了肯定的回答。
    要打好今年春耕生产这一仗，千条万条，落实毛主席最新指示，突出无产阶级政治是第一条。坚持办好毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想挂帅，这是搞好春耕生产的最根本的途径。
    伟大导师毛主席教导说：“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”毛泽东思想学习班正是灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向的一种最好的形式。
    大寨公社为在农忙季节坚持办好学习班提供了很好的经验。他们因时因地制宜地办好学习班，保证政治工作不间断地进行。这一经验值得学习。——编者
    办好农忙学习班　鼓足干劲闹春耕
    大寨公社根据春耕大忙情况，举办毛泽东思想学习班，变大型为小型，变集中为分散，效果很好
    毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”山西昔阳县大寨公社遵照毛主席的教导，从去年十二月开始，各大队陆续开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六十七个，参加学习的有七千多人，大大促进了干部和社员群众的思想革命化，有力地推动了冬季的农田水利基本建设和备耕工作。
    春耕大忙开始，各大队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，出现了新的矛盾：一、冬季农活集中，社员上工收工比较统一，便于集中学；现在整地、翻肥、送肥、耕地等工种增加，社员上工收工较难统一，集中学习很不方便。二、冬季天短夜长，便于晚上学；开春以后夜短天长，干部、社员劳动强度增加，晚上学，影响白天生产。三、农忙了，学习时间短，只能少数人发言，影响人人参加斗私批修。四、干部、社员都下了地，活思想也到了地，学习班办在屋子里，不能及时解决问题。
    怎样解决这些新的矛盾？大寨公社的领导同志遵照毛主席关于“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习”的教导，向大寨大队学习。大寨大队的干部和社员说：“春耕大忙，越忙越要抓紧学习毛泽东思想，办好毛泽东思想学习班。”他们把学习班办到地头、饭场，坚持天天学，事事用。大寨公社学习了大寨大队的经验，号召全公社向大寨学习，大办农忙学习班。
    各大队根据实际情况，本着“大型变小型，集中变分散，整学变零学，时间长变短，干部、群众一块学”的精神，把学习班搬到地头、饭场、社员家庭院落，把大队举办的学习班分散到作业组、牧业组、副业组。这样，全公社的学习班由原来的六十七个变成二百零六个。
    学习班的形式随着农忙季节变化以后，公社、大队对学习班的领导不是放松而是抓得更紧了。他们主要抓四条：一、党支部加强统一领导，干部带头到生产第一线，分工负责领导，和社员一块劳动，一块学习，一块斗私批修。二、组织辅导员到地头、饭场、院落，分片包干辅导。组织党员、团员和积极分子在群众中发挥带头、骨干、桥梁作用。三、不断总结交流各种类型学习班的成绩和经验。大队每七天组织一次分片讲用会，每半个月组织一次全队讲用会，评比先进，树立典型。四、学习内容少而精，有针对性，学习时间短，有灵活性。学习班以全面落实毛主席最新指示为纲，重点学习“老三篇”，结合中心任务，用毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动论点；用毛主席的一条最新指示，解决一个活思想；用毛主席的一篇文章，解决一个实际问题。学一点，用一点，立竿见影。
    大寨公社的农忙学习班收到了很好的效果。一、学习班多种多样，机动灵活，范围很广，参加学习的人多。二、学习班办到生产第一线，更便于学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。三、促进了革命的大批判，人人口诛笔伐，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在农村散布的各种修正主义流毒。四、学习班办到工地，便于抓活思想，及时对照毛主席著作，有针对性地解决问题。五、促进了干部参加集体生产劳动，密切了干群关系，加强了干部之间、干群之间的团结。
    现在，昔阳县大寨公社的农忙学习班越办越好，有力地促进了干部社员的思想革命化，有力地促进了春耕生产。
