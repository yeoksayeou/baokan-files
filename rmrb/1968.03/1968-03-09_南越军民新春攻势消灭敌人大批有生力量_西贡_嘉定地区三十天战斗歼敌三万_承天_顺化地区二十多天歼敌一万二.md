South Vietnamese military and civilians launch New Year Offensive, annihilating large enemy forces

In the Saigon-Cho Lon and surrounding areas, military and civilian forces have fought bravely and tenaciously for thirty days from January 31 to February 29, achieving extremely brilliant results.

According to incomplete statistics, military and civilian forces in the Saigon-Cho Lon and surrounding areas have annihilated 30,000 enemy troops (including 14,000 American invaders) in this period. This includes the complete annihilation of one American battalion, 20 companies, seven battalions, and 22 companies of puppet forces, and the severe damage of four battalions. They have also captured and forced the surrender of 70 outposts and sentry posts; shot down and destroyed more than 400 aircraft; destroyed nearly 500 military vehicles, most of which were tanks and armored vehicles; and sunk or damaged 12 military ships, including one 10,000-ton warship.

During this period, military and civilian forces in the Saigon-Cho Lon and surrounding areas launched extensive and fierce attacks on many military and political headquarters of the U.S.-puppet clique, on all enemy airfields and military warehouses, and cut off many enemy water and land transportation routes, further isolating the enemy in Saigon.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the People's Revolutionary Committee of the Thua Thien-Hue region issued its second proclamation on February 28, enthusiastically praising the tremendous victories achieved by the military and civilian forces of the Thua Thien-Hue region since the launch of the New Year Offensive on January 30, and calling on them to continue to advance and achieve complete victory.

The proclamation states that from January 31 to February 20, military and civilian forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region fought hundreds of battles, annihilating and disintegrating 12,153 enemy troops (including 2,223 American invaders), capturing and surrendering 1,733 enemy troops, and disintegrating 4,710 puppet police and various levels of puppet government personnel. They almost completely annihilated one puppet armored regiment, six battalions, and 16 companies, and severely damaged one American armored regiment, one puppet regiment, and one parachute combat regiment. Additionally, military and civilian forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region shot down and destroyed 125 enemy aircraft, destroyed 195 military vehicles, destroyed 16 cannons, sank 33 ships, blew up eight bridges, cut off the first national highway and various provincial highways, and seized a large amount of weapons, war tools, and military supplies.

The proclamation states that military and civilian forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region have controlled Hue City, liberated the key areas around Hue City and various county towns, and liberated almost all rural areas in the region, freeing 330,000 out of 380,000 people in the province.

The proclamation states that military and civilian forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region have smashed the puppet government's administrative machinery at the provincial, county, commune, village, and ward levels. The puppet army is in a state of paralysis. Revolutionary armed forces have multiplied.

The proclamation states that during this period, tens of thousands of people in the entire region have risen up to fight, pursue and eliminate bandits, attack enemy outposts, and actively serve the battle. The proclamation points out that the closer to victory, the more difficulties will arise, and the battle will still be fierce. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will still struggle desperately. The military and civilian forces of Thua Thien-Hue must strengthen their unity, persist in the battle, fight hard, and fight continuously to achieve even greater victories.
