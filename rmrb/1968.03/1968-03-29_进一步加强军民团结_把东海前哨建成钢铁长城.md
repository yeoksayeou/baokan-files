They will further promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, March 28th: Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

They excitedly say: The establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again powerfully proves the correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is in an excellent situation, not just a good situation. The overall situation is better than ever before." They enthusiastically acclaim that the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! They shout in joy a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

Military and civilian personnel in Beijing, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Gansu, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Jilin, Guangxi, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary masses and military personnel stationed there. Some regions also held celebration meetings and symposiums.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces who fought side by side with the revolutionary masses of Zhejiang province were particularly elated to hear the news of the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They said: The birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee announces the complete failure of the evil plot by China's Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest traitors within the party and their agents to restore capitalism in Zhejiang. The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu have greatly strengthened and consolidated the proletarian dictatorship at the southeastern gate of the motherland. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and all class enemies at home and abroad. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province held a celebration meeting on the evening of the 28th to enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Leaders of the provincial revolutionary committee and the stationed military attended the meeting. The Red Guards of colleges and universities in the Lanzhou region held a gathering in the afternoon of the 28th to enthusiastically acclaim the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Representatives at the meeting said: The establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again powerfully proves: Following Chairman Mao is victory! They expressed their determination to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary masses across the country enthusiastically said that the glorious birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a brilliant achievement of the unlimited loyalty of the broad military and civilian personnel of Zhejiang to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must learn from the revolutionary comrades of Zhejiang, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to set up and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, resolutely oppose the erroneous tendencies of factionalism and sectarianism, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, criticize anarchism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances, promote revolutionary three-in-ones, do a good job in revolutionary criticism and struggle, reform, and local struggle, criticism, and reform, further implement Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, focus on revolution, vigorously promote production, and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Zhang Fuqi, a responsible person of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Shandong Province and a national model agricultural laborer, expressed the warmest congratulations to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhejiang on behalf of the entire province's poor and lower-middle peasants upon hearing the news of the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. He said: For decades, the great struggles of the revolutionary people of our country and the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years have fully proven: Whenever we follow Chairman Mao, the revolution makes great strides; whenever we go against Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolution suffers setbacks. "Following Chairman Mao is victory!" This is an absolute truth. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, step by step follow the great leader Chairman Mao, do as Chairman Mao says, go where Chairman Mao points, and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses in Hunan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Guangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, Xinjiang, and other places expressed that the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great encouragement to us. We must learn from the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people of Zhejiang, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, advance bravely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and welcome the early birth of the provincial (regional) revolutionary committee.

While celebrating the glorious birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary masses across the country seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." They said, the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more acute and complex the class struggle becomes. We must clearly see that the class enemies do not resign themselves to their doom, and they will still make desperate struggles. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and be ready at any time to smash the sabotage activities of a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and protect the proletarian revolutionary power. Revolutionary workers in Harbin excitedly said, Zhejiang and our Heilongjiang, one is the East China Sea defense front, and the other is the anti-revisionist front in the northern part of the motherland. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, both provinces have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must never forget class struggle, heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely smash the sabotage activities of all class enemies at home and abroad, and build our country's borders and coastal defenses into iron great walls. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of Zhengzhou expressed their determination to focus on class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Henan, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every position.

The news of the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee greatly inspired the people's liberation army units stationed on the front lines of defending the great motherland. Broad cadres and soldiers expressed their determination to, according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "launching a larger-scale enthusiastic movement of supporting the army and loving the people," further strengthen military-civilian unity, defend the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the newly born proletarian revolutionary power. The broad cadres and soldiers of the Beijing troops, the "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" in Shanghai, the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" in Jiangxi, and the units executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in Hefei, Lanzhou, Wuhan, and other places all expressed their determination to learn from the Zhejiang troops who have established immortal merits in the "three supports and two militaries" work, work together with the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses, seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and do a better job in the "three supports and two militaries" work. The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who day and night guard the front lines of the motherland's coastal and border defenses, upon hearing the news, expressed their determination: In the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to further strengthen preparedness, heighten vigilance, and if the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely annihilate it thoroughly, completely, and cleanly.
