Harbin Bicycle Factory Focuses on Saving Expenses

Harbin Bicycle Factory, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive to "further economize and make revolution," has seen its revolutionary committee members lead by example in establishing new revolutionary customs. Revolutionary workers are striving to be models of economizing and making revolution. Throughout the factory, everyone is meticulous in planning and saving every bit. Since last year, production plans have been exceeded every month; management expenses and the consumption of raw materials, supplies, and other materials have been continuously reduced.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the higher authorities had allocated funds to this factory to purchase a small car. After the Cultural Revolution began, this matter was put on hold. Last April, after the revolutionary committee was established, someone raised the question of how to handle this fund. At that time, there were two opinions among the committee members: one opinion advocated buying the car, reasoning that the factory is far from the city and work requires it, so if not bought, the money would have to be returned. The other opinion disagreed with buying the car, believing that buying a car is a small matter, but what kind of style to establish and what path to take after the proletarian revolutionaries take power is a big matter. Through study, everyone deeply understood that economizing and making revolution is not just about saving a few dollars, but is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionaries can hold and use power correctly. It is a tough class struggle that the proletarian revolutionaries face after taking power. Therefore, they decided not to purchase the small car and saved this fund.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directive to "further economize and make revolution," the revolutionary committee of this factory has taken many revolutionary measures in saving expenses. Anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings is resisted. The committee's office maintains a spirit of hard work and simplicity, office supplies are used frugally, and office paper is generally replaced with old newspapers. Everywhere, meticulous planning and saving expenses are emphasized. The custom of "waste is shameful, saving is glorious" is widely promoted among the workers. In the past, this factory hired temporary workers to transport and move materials. Now, the workers have taken on this responsibility themselves. Except in special circumstances, most of the material transportation is done by the workers themselves, saving national expenses.

### 哈尔滨自行车厂注意节约开支

　　哈尔滨自行车厂注意节约开支
    哈尔滨自行车厂在全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示中，革命委员会领导成员带头大立革命新风，革命职工争当节约闹革命的模范，全厂上下处处精打细算，注意点滴节约。从去年以来，生产计划月月超额完成；管理费用和原料、材料、物料消耗不断下降。
    在无产阶级文化大革命之前，上级主管部门曾拨给这个厂一笔款项，准备购买一辆小轿车。文化大革命开始后，这件事搁下来了。去年四月，工厂革命委员会成立后，有人提出了这笔款怎么处理的问题。当时，在革命委员会成员中有两种意见：一种意见主张买汽车，理由是工厂离市区较远，工作又需要，不买，钱还得上缴。另一种意见则不同意买，认为买汽车是小事，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，立什么作风，走什么道路，是大事。经过学习，大家深刻领会到，节约闹革命，不仅仅是节省几个钱的问题，而是关系到无产阶级革命派能否掌好权、用好权的大事，是无产阶级革命派掌权以后，面临着的一场阶级斗争的硬仗。于是，他们决定不再购买小轿车，把这笔款节约下来。
    为了全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，这个厂的革命委员会在节约开支方面，还采取了许多革命措施。凡是不符合毛主席教导的，都加以抵制。革命委员会的办公室保持艰苦朴素，办公用品一律从俭，办公用纸一般都尽量用废旧表报代用。处处精打细算，事事节约开支。浪费可耻、节约光荣的风尚，在这个厂的职工中大为发扬。过去，这个厂搬运、倒运材料都雇用临时工来完成，现在职工们主动挑起了这副担子。搬运材料，除特殊情况外，大部分都由职工自己完成，为国家节约了开支。
