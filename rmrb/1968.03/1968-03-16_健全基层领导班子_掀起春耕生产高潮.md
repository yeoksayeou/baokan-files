The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhenhua County are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handling the issue of cadres, and over 90% of the production brigade and production team cadres in the entire county have stepped forward, with over 70% being elected into the leadership teams. Cadres and the masses are united, and spring production is in full swing.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 15th — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhenhua County, Shandong Province, are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, correctly handling the issue of cadres, establishing and strengthening the leadership teams of production brigades and production teams, and swiftly launching the spring production campaign.

Since the beginning of the spring, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this county have, in order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolved to fire the first shot in the spring ploughing production campaign and strive for an even greater agricultural harvest this year. However, a prominent issue facing the entire county is that the leadership teams of some production brigades and production teams have not yet been established or strengthened, and some revolutionary cadres have not yet stood up to lead the revolution and promote production together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. To solve this problem, county, district, and commune-level authorities have recently, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "cadres must be educated and the scope of education must be expanded," consecutively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes attended by poor and lower-middle peasant community members, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary cadres. The focus of these study classes was on learning and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of cadres. In the study classes, poor and lower-middle peasant community members, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary cadres, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and using the "Three Articles" as weapons, recalled the bitterness of the old society together, criticized the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and exposed the evil plots of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements attempting to restore capitalism. Gradually, they eliminated ideological barriers and deepened class sentiments. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: Most of our cadres are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds; they are our class brothers. In every political movement, they have been active participants. If they make mistakes, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "punish past mistakes to prevent future ones and cure the sickness to save the patient," help them raise their consciousness, recognize and correct their mistakes, and welcome them to stand up and join us in making the revolution. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, also realized that whether or not to release cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings is a matter of loyalty or disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Most cadres have firm stands, work actively, and have rich experience. Allowing them to step forward will make the revolution and production go even better. Most cadres, through studying together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, have raised their class consciousness and realized: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have pulled us back from the wrong path, which is a great thing. It was wrong to have grievances in the past. They voluntarily made self-criticisms to the poor and lower-middle peasants and gained their understanding.

Currently, over 90% of the production brigade and production team cadres in this county have stepped forward, and over 70% have been elected into the leadership teams of production brigades and production teams. Under the leadership of the new leadership teams, the entire county has swiftly launched a spring production campaign. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside are earnestly discussing and implementing this year's production plans, actively engaging in fertilizer accumulation, transportation, wheat field management, and farm tool repair, and everywhere there is a lively revolutionary scene.

　　健全基层领导班子
    掀起春耕生产高潮
    沾化县广大贫下中农认真执行毛主席指示，正确对待干部，全县生产大队和生产队干部，百分之九十以上站了出来，百分之七十以上选进领导班子。干部群众一条心，春季生产热气腾腾。
    新华社济南十五日电　山东省沾化县广大贫下中农，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，正确对待干部，建立和健全生产大队、生产队的领导班子，迅速掀起了春季生产高潮。
    开春以来，这个县的广大贫下中农，为了落实毛主席的最新指示，决心打响春耕生产第一炮，夺取全年农业更大丰收。但是，摆在全县的一个突出问题是，有一些生产大队和生产队的领导班子还没有建立或健全起来，有些革命干部还没有站起来和贫下中农一道抓革命，促生产。为了解决这个问题，最近县、区、社各级都遵照毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的教导，连续举办了有贫下中农社员、革命群众组织负责人和革命干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班，着重学习和落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。在学习班里，贫下中农社员、革命群众组织负责人和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，通过一起忆旧社会的苦，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线，一起控诉地富反坏分子企图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，逐渐从思想上消除了隔阂，增进了阶级感情。贫下中农说：我们的干部大多数是贫下中农出身，是我们的阶级弟兄。在历次政治运动中，他们大多数是积极分子。他们犯了错误，我们要遵照毛主席的教导，“惩前毖后，治病救人”，帮助他们提高觉悟，认识和改正错误，欢迎他们站出来和我们一道闹革命。一些革命群众组织的负责人，通过斗私批修，也认识到敢不敢按照毛主席的教导，大胆地解放干部，这是对伟大领袖毛主席忠与不忠的大问题。大多数干部立场坚定，工作积极，工作经验多，让他们站出来，革命和生产就会搞得更好。大多数干部通过和贫下中农一起学习，也提高了阶级觉悟，认识到：在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大贫下中农起来把自己从错误的道路上拉了回来，这是一件天大的好事，过去有怨气太不对了。他们纷纷主动地向贫下中农作检讨，取得了群众的谅解。
    目前，这个县的生产大队和生产队干部，百分之九十以上都站了出来，百分之七十以上被选进了生产大队和生产队的领导班子。在新的领导班子的领导下，全县很快掀起了春季生产热潮。广大贫下中农和农村基层干部认真讨论、落实今年的生产计划，积极开展积肥、运肥、麦田管理、整修农具等各项农事活动，到处一片热气腾腾的革命景象。
