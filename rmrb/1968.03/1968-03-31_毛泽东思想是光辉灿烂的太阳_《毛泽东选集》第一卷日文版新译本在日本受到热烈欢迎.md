The first volume of the new Japanese translation of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," published by the China Foreign Languages Publishing House, has begun to be distributed in Japan and has been enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary people of Japan.

The revolutionary people of Japan, who are on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, have long eagerly awaited the new Japanese translation of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." A progressive bookstore in Tokyo has been receiving a large number of letters from all over Japan for several months, pre-ordering the new Japanese translation of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Many people also inquired in their letters about when the new Japanese translations of the second, third, and fourth volumes of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" would be published, expressing their urgent desire to study Mao Zedong Thought.

A young student from Aichi Prefecture wrote enthusiastically in a letter: "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism." He expressed his determination to seriously study the works of Chairman Mao.

A young man named Shimura from Tokyo said to a Chinese reporter after receiving the new Japanese translation of the first volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": "The 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' is a must-read treasure for all advanced workers, peasants, fishermen, intellectuals, youth, students, and all laboring people in Japan." He said that Chairman Mao's works give us boundless strength and courage. Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual sustenance for our struggle, the radiant sun illuminating the path of national liberation for the Japanese people, and a powerful ideological weapon for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to strive for liberation. Shimura expressed his intention to study Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with the situation in Japan.

The official organ of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), the newspaper "Japan and China," recently published an article stating that the publication of the new Japanese translation of the first volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has created the best conditions for spreading and studying Mao Zedong Thought in Japan. The article highly praised Chairman Mao for comprehensively developing Marxism-Leninism.
