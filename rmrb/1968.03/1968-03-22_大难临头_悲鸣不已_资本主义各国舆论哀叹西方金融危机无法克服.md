The severe financial crisis sweeping through the capitalist world has caused great turmoil and panic in various capitalist countries. Many countries' bourgeois media are worried that a major economic crisis is on the horizon.

The British *Guardian* said that this financial crisis "is obviously similar to the situation in 1929." The newspaper believes that if the situation continues to deteriorate, "it will certainly lead to a (capitalist) global economic crisis."

The French *Combat* and the West German *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* simultaneously exclaimed that this crisis is unprecedented in decades. *Combat* wrote: "The rush to buy gold is just one of the astonishing signs of the most severe economic crisis in the West since 1931." The West German *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* also said: "The continental European countries have repeatedly warned: the international monetary system is falling into the most severe crisis since its establishment twenty years ago, and now this crisis has occurred."

The Japanese *Yomiuri Shimbun* also expressed similar views on the 16th. It said: "The phrase 'world panic' that has been forgotten for about thirty years is now pressing down on people with great force." The newspaper believes: "The gold-buying frenzy that triggered the panic has finally pushed the international monetary system to the brink of collapse, the situation is urgent." A reporter from Kyodo News also exclaimed: "This is the largest international monetary crisis since the war."

Many bourgeois publications believe that the cause of this capitalist world financial crisis is the weakness of the United States and its aggressive and war policies.

The British *Times* said: "The real problem is the weakness of the United States. The U.S. government is in a state of confusion due to the terrible disaster of the Vietnam War. The U.S. is unlikely to achieve a normal balance of payments and stop the outflow of gold in 1968." The West German *Allgemeine Zeitung* said: "The escalating Vietnam War brings new military needs, further weakening the dollar. The Vietnam War is a grave for the dollar."

The French *Combat* also said: "Due to the worst policies implemented by the United States, all capitalist countries have fallen into trouble."

After the Washington Conference announced the implementation of the "dual gold price system," the capitalist world's media expressed doubts about the effectiveness of this "emergency measure," believing it cannot save the crisis-ridden capitalist financial and monetary system.

The British *Daily Mail* in an article titled "Just a Patch" said: "The Washington Conference, the dual gold market, and the large-scale aid to the pound are just a bandage to stop the bleeding. It cannot cure the wound."

The British *Guardian* in an editorial said that the "emergency surgery" at the Washington Conference is not enough to save the "ailing" capitalist monetary system.

The French *Le Monde* said: "The decision by the central banks of the gold pool member countries to stop supplying gold to the private free market is tantamount to the U.S. Treasury admitting defeat."

U.S. bourgeois publications also believe that the decisions made at the Washington Conference cannot solve the problem. *The New York Times* in an editorial said that the dual gold price system is a "temporary measure aimed at giving financial authorities the breathing room they desperately need."

The United Press International said that the measures taken at the Washington Conference are "temporary. Experts say that unless the United States closes its international balance of payments gap and takes other measures to restore the world's confidence in the dollar, the situation could even be worse than before."

### 大难临头  悲鸣不已  资本主义各国舆论哀叹西方金融危机无法克服

    大难临头  悲鸣不已
    资本主义各国舆论哀叹西方金融危机无法克服
    本报讯　席卷资本主义世界的严重的金融危机，在资本主义各国引起了极大的混乱和恐慌。许多国家的资产阶级舆论都担心一场经济大危机将要来临。
    英国《卫报》说，这次金融危机“与一九二九年的情况相似是明显的。”这家报纸认为，如果再发展下去，“那就肯定会引起一场（资本主义）世界性的经济大危机。”
    法国《战斗报》和西德《法兰克福汇报》不约而同地惊呼这次危机是几十年来所没有的。《战斗报》写道：这次“抢购黄金，只是西方自一九三一年以来的最严重的经济危机的惊人征兆之一”。西德《法兰克福汇报》也说：
  “欧洲大陆国家早就一再警告：国际货币制度正在陷入自从它二十年前建立以来的最严重危机，现在这种危机已经发生了”。
    日本《读卖新闻》十六日也发表了同样的论调。它说：“被人们忘记了大约三十年的
  ‘（资本主义）世界恐慌’这句话，现在正以巨大的力量压在人们的头上”。这家报纸认为：“引起恐慌状态的抢购黄金风潮，使国际货币制度终于陷入了即将崩溃的绝境，形势是紧迫的。”日本共同社记者也惊呼：这次金融危机“是战后最大的一次国际货币危机。”
    许多资产阶级报刊都认为，引起这场资本主义世界金融危机的原因，是美国的虚弱和它奉行侵略政策和战争政策。
    英国《泰晤士报》说：“真正的问题是美国的衰弱。美国政府被越南战争的可怕灾难弄得心烦意乱。美国不大可能做到在一九六八年中达到收支平衡正常和制止黄金外流。”西德《总汇报》说：“逐步升级的越南战争所带来的越来越新的军需使美元进一步疲软。越南战争是美元的一个坟墓。”
    法国《战斗报》也说：“由于美国执行了最坏的政策，使所有资本主义国家陷入困境。”
    华盛顿会议宣布实行黄金“双重价格制度”之后，资本主义世界舆论对于这个“应急措施”的效果纷纷表示怀疑，认为它根本无法挽救危机深重的资本主义金融货币体系。
    英国《每日邮报》在一篇题为《一块补钉而已》的文章里说：“这次华盛顿会议、双重黄金市场以及对英镑的大规模援助，只不过是一个止住流血的止血器而已。它治不了创伤”。
    英国《卫报》在一篇社论中说，在华盛顿会议上“既搞急救又动手术的作法”，不足以挽救“正在生病的”资本主义货币体系。
    法国《世界报》说：“黄金总库成员国中央银行向私人开放的自由市场停止供应黄金的决定，实际上等于美国财政部供认失败了”。
    美国的资产阶级报刊也认为华盛顿会议的决定并不能解决问题。《纽约时报》在社论中说，黄金双重价格制度是一种“权宜之计，目的是使金融当局得到它们十分需要的喘息时间”。
    美国合众国际社说，华盛顿会议所采取的措施的“效果是暂时的。专家们说，除非美国弥补它的国际收支差额，并采取其他的措施来恢复世界各国对美元的信心，否则情况可能甚至比以前更糟糕”。
