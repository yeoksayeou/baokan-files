Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 9th - After the news of the intimidation of Lu Yuwen reached here, Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a forum at 7 pm today, attended by more than 30 engineers and workers. Nineteen employees spoke at the meeting.

	Meng Tai, section chief of the repair section of the Ironmaking Plant, was the first to speak. He said that Chu Anping said that now it is a "Party world." But let's take the People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members as examples. They include people from all walks of life, and they all discuss and handle affairs democratically. What is this "Party world"? Meng Tai went on to say that the person who wrote the black letter wanted the Communist Party to step down and the working class to step down. This is what imperialism and its running dogs hope for. We, the working class, must resolutely fight these people to the end.

	Huang Demao, deputy director of the steel bar processing workshop of Anshan Industrial Company, said that the person who wrote the black letter wanted to undermine the Party's rectification and prevent us from building a socialist society better. He also refuted Ge Peiqi's speech with the improvement of his life after liberation.

	Li Tingsheng, a steelmaking worker at the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, said that our workers welcome all truly beneficial speeches and actions for the Party's rectification, and resolutely oppose spreading various remarks that deviate from socialism in the name of helping the Party's rectification. He said, the opinions of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping and others, and what was said in the threatening letter Lu Yuwen received, all wanted to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. We want to ask: If not the Communist Party, who should lead? Do we want imperialism and its running dogs to ride on our heads again?

	Zhang Yue, deputy director and engineer of the Ironmaking Plant, said that helping the Party's rectification must have a position, that is, the position of the people and the position of the revolution. Lu Yuwen is standing on this position. We want to ask what position Ge Peiqi is standing on?

    不要共产党领导要谁领导？
    据新华社鞍山9日电　恐吓卢郁文事件的消息传到此间以后，鞍山钢铁公司在今天下午七时举行了一个由三十多个工程师和工人参加的座谈会，会上有十九个职工发言。
    炼铁厂修理工段段长孟泰第一个发言，他说，储安平说，现在是“党天下”。但我们就拿人民代表大会代表和政协委员来说吧，包括了各方面的人士，都是民主讨论办事，这叫什么“党天下”呢？孟泰接着说，写黑信的人想要共产党下台，要工人阶级下台，这是帝国主义及其走狗所希望的，我们工人阶级要坚决同这种人斗争到底。
    鞍山工业公司钢筋加工车间副主任黄德茂说，写黑信的人是想破坏党的整风和阻挠我们更好地建设社会主义社会。他还以自己在解放后生活改善的情况，驳斥了葛佩琦的讲话。
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂炼钢工人李廷胜说，我们工人欢迎一切真正有利党的整风的言论和行动，坚决反对在帮助党整风的名义下散布各种离开社会主义的言论。他说，葛佩琦、储安平等人的意见和卢郁文收到的那封恐吓信上所说的都是想取消共产党领导，我们要问：不要共产党领导要谁领导？难道让帝国主义及其走狗再骑在我们头上？
    炼铁厂副厂长、工程师张钺说，帮助党整风一定要有立场，这就是人民的立场、革命的立场。卢郁文站的就是这种立场。我们要问葛佩琦站的什么立场？
