　　National Sea Salt Spring Harvest Achieved
    (Our Newspaper) According to preliminary statistics, the total national sea salt production in May has exceeded the monthly plan by 29.77%. The key salt producing areas of Liaoning, Hangu, and Tangda all exceeded their monthly production plans by 40%-90% in May. Compared to the historically high-yield May of 1955, Liaoning exceeded it by 56%, Tangda by 58%, and Hangu by 123%, setting new historical records.
    The abundant sea salt harvest this spring is due not only to the favorable weather conditions with less rain, but also mainly to the active efforts of all salt industry workers. As early as winter, workers in various regions were busy with preparing brine under the ice and repairing beaches and ponds. Although the start of the sun-drying season was delayed due to the cold spring, workers at all salt fields carefully managed the changeable weather, actively producing and preserving brine, thereby creating favorable conditions for the overproduction in May. Since the start of the peak production period in May, the work of the beach workers has become even more intense. To support salt production, the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the Hangu Municipal Committee of Hebei Province mobilized thousands of soldiers, cadres, and residents to help transport salt and pile it into mounds.
    June will be a crucial month for determining the completion of the annual plan. Currently, salt industry workers in all regions are making persistent efforts to strive for even greater harvests. (Yan Sheng)

　　全国海盐春晒丰收
    本报讯  全国海盐生产5月份的总产量据初步统计已经超额完成月计划29.77％。辽宁、汉沽、塘大几个重点盐区，5月份都超额40％—90％完成月产量计划，如同历史上丰产的1955年同月产量比较辽宁超过56％，塘大超过58％，汉沽超过123％，创造历史新纪录。
    今春海盐获得丰产，除因气候少雨有利产制外，主要是全体盐业职工的积极努力。早在冬季各地职工就忙于冰下制卤和修滩、整池等准备工作；今年开晒的时间虽因春寒拖迟，但是各场职工都审慎地掌握了多变的天气，积极制卤、保卤，因而给5月份的超产，创造了有利条件。5月旺产开始以来，滩地职工工作愈加紧张。天津市委和河北省汉沽市委为了支援盐业生产，并发动了部队、干部和居民共数千人来场帮助抬盐集坨。
    6月份的海盐生产，将是决定完成全年计划的重要关键，目前各区盐业职工正再接再厉，为争取更大的丰产而努力。  （言声）
