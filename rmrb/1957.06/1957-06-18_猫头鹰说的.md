What the Owl Said
　　Chen Bochui

　　The owl said: "The world is dark!"
　　For a long time, the owl lived in the night: he ate at night, he drank at night, he heard the sounds of the night, and he saw only darkness. Although there were sometimes stars and a moon in the night, he could not see these "sparks of stars."
　　The owl said: "The world is dark!"
　　Day came, and it dawned.
　　But the owl squatted in the dark corner of the tree, saying like an old monk chanting scriptures in a dim hall: "The world is dark! The world is dark!"
　　The rooster frankly crowed. "Friend, didn't you hear me crow 'Cock-a-doodle-doo!'? Now it's morning with sunshine everywhere!"
　　The owl said unhappily: "Morning is worse than night! Even darker!"
　　The pigeon was surprised to hear this and couldn't help but say, "Friend, you're wrong, the sun rises in the morning, it's bright and warm."
　　The owl said angrily: "You're lying! Why do I feel even colder!"
　　The magpie kindly advised from the side: "Friend, really, the world is so beautiful and brilliant, if you don't believe it, open your eyes and take a good look. If you're afraid the light will dazzle your eyes, you can sniff with your nose, you can also sense how fresh the air is."
　　The owl answered harshly: "You're all in the same faction! You all speak with one voice! The world is dark!"
　　The rooster regretted it and sighed. "Why does he always speak with his eyes closed!"
　　"I'm afraid he likes the darkness from the bottom of his heart, right?" the pigeon said doubtfully.
　　"No wonder he's afraid of the light and curses the morning!" the magpie seemed to have reached a conclusion.
　　Until now, the owl is still saying in the daytime like a fool talking in his sleep: "The world is dark! The world is dark!"

　　猫头鹰说的
　　陈伯吹
    猫头鹰说：“世界是黑暗的！”
    长久以来，猫头鹰生活在夜里：他夜里吃、他夜里喝、他听见的是夜的声音，他看见的是一片黑暗。尽管夜里有时候也有星，有月，不过这些“星星之火”他是看不见的。
    猫头鹰说：“世界是黑暗的！”
    白天来了，天亮了。
    可是猫头鹰蹲在阴暗的树角落里，像个老和尚坐在灰暗的殿堂里念经般地说：“世界是黑暗的！世界是黑暗的！”
    公鸡爽直地开腔了。“朋友，你不是听见我‘喔喔喔！’啼了吗？现在是阳光遍地的早晨啦！”
    猫头鹰不高兴地说：“早晨比夜里更坏！更加黑暗！”
    鸽子听了很惊异，忍不住说：“朋友，你说错了吧，早晨升起了太阳，又明亮，又温暖。”
    猫头鹰气愤地说：“你撒谎！怎么我身上更觉得冷冰冰的呢！”
    喜鹊从旁好言劝导说：“朋友，当真的，世界多么美丽灿烂，不信你睁开眼睛仔细看看。要是你怕亮光耀花你的眼睛，你就用鼻子嗅嗅，也可以觉察出这空气多么新鲜哪。”
    猫头鹰狠狠地回答说：“你宗派！反正你们一鼻孔出气！世界是黑暗的！”
    公鸡惋惜着，叹了一口气。“他为什么老闭上眼睛说话呢！”
    “恐怕他是打从心眼里喜欢黑暗的吧？”鸽子疑疑惑惑地说。
    “这就怪不得他害怕光明、咒骂早晨了！”喜鹊仿佛得出了结论。
    直到现在，猫头鹰还在白天里痴人说梦般地说：“世界是黑暗的！世界是黑暗的！”
