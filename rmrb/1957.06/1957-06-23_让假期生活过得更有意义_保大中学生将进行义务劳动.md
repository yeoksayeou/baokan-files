Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 21st: To make their holiday life more meaningful, middle and university students across Bulgaria have formed many labor shock brigades, preparing to engage in voluntary labor such as building roads, parks, sports fields, and assisting agricultural cooperatives with the summer harvest during this summer vacation.

　　Twelve hundred students from Sofia University have formed a labor shock brigade. During the thirty-five-day holiday, they will contract to repair more than two kilometers of highway on Vitosha Mountain in the suburbs of Sofia. Some Chinese and Korean international students have also signed up to join this shock brigade. The work of university and middle school students in Bulgaria participating in voluntary labor during the summer vacation is led by the Dimitrov People's Youth League at all levels. In the past four years from 1946 to 1949, a broad youth labor shock brigade movement was launched across the country. More than 500,000 young people from all walks of life actively participated in this movement.
