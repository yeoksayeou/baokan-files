Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: TASS reports: Today, all the people of the Soviet Union are warmly celebrating the 250th anniversary of the founding of Leningrad.

On the eve of the holiday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order awarding Leningrad the Order of Lenin in recognition of the contributions of the city's working people during the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War, as well as in economic and cultural construction. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers, and the Central Committee of the CPSU also sent telegrams of congratulations to the people of Leningrad on this day.

The working people of Leningrad greeted the festival with joy yesterday. During the day, mass rallies were held in various factories. In the evening, the Leningrad City Soviet held a grand commemorative meeting, attended by representatives of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and many foreign guests. Feng Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, China, was invited to attend the commemorative meeting and delivered a congratulatory speech.

Leningrad was founded 250 years ago as a fortress and port, formerly known as Petrograd. The gunshots of the great October Revolution were fired from here, hence it is hailed as the cradle of the October Revolution. In the Soviet era, Leningrad has developed into the second largest city in the Soviet Union, with a strong industrial production and scientific research base. During the Great Patriotic War, Leningrad was besieged by German fascists for nine hundred days. The historical sites of the Siege of Leningrad are still praised by the Soviet people and progressive mankind around the world.

　　列宁格勒建城二百五十周年
    全苏人民热烈纪念英雄城的生日
    最高苏维埃主席团授予列宁勋章
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：今天，全苏联人民都在热烈庆祝列宁格勒建城二百五十周年。
    在节日的前一天，苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令，授予列宁格勒以列宁勋章，以表彰这个城市的劳动人民在十月革命和卫国战争期间以及在经济和文化建设方面的贡献。苏联最高苏维埃主席团、部长会议和苏共中央还在这一天打电报向列宁格勒人祝贺。
    列宁格勒的劳动人民昨天就怀着欢欣的心情来迎接节日。白天，各个工厂都举行了群众大会。晚上，列宁格勒市苏维埃又举行了隆重的纪念大会，参加这次大会的有苏联各民族的代表和许多外国来宾。中国北京市副市长冯基平应邀参加了这次纪念大会，并且向大会致了祝词。
    列宁格勒是二百五十年前作为炮垒和港口而开始建立的，旧名彼得格勒。伟大的十月革命的炮声就是从这里发出的，因此被誉为十月革命的摇篮。在苏维埃时代，列宁格勒已经发展成为全苏第二大城市，拥有强大的工业生产和科学研究的基础。在卫国战争期间，列宁格勒受到德国法西斯的包围达九百天，列宁格勒保卫战的史迹，至今仍为苏联人民和全世界进步人类所传诵。
