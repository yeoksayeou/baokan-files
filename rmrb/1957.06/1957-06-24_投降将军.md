　　“Surrender General”
　　Ěr Dōng
　　This title is borrowed from a conversation between two "fraternal fellows" published in the June 18th "Guangming Daily." The "Surrender General" is the posthumous title that fraternal fellow B bestowed upon fraternal fellow A's ancestor, Zhang Han.
　　According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Han was initially "afraid," and sent his chief clerk, Chang Shi Xin, back to the court to inquire about the political situation; then, "Zhang Han was suspicious," when he received advice from Chen Yu; finally, having no other choice, he surrendered. Before this, Xiang Yu had "cut off his supply routes in nine battles and greatly defeated him." In the Romance of the Western Han Dynasty, there is a description of "Xiang Yu of Chu defeating Zhang Han nine times." In terms of battle, he was not very capable.
　　However, Zhang Han's betrayal of Qin and surrender to Chu was a righteous act, not a bad thing. Therefore, the later Grand Historian Sima Qian and later novelists did not use any derogatory terms for him. This point is still worth emulating by today's "fraternal fellow" and worth referencing by another "fraternal fellow."
　　On the ideological battlefield, anti-socialist remarks are met with a head-on blow and are utterly defeated as soon as they appear, why wait for "nine battles" before surrendering!
　　The Records of the Grand Historian writes that "Zhang Han met Xiang Yu and wept," indicating a genuine surrender, without playing two-faced tricks, which is better than the current scene of one "fraternal fellow" reluctantly saying a little with a "heavy heart," and another "fraternal fellow" resisting criticism with "peace of mind"—a double act by two fraternal "fellows."

### “投降将军”

　　“投降将军”
　　迩冬
    这题目是借来的，见6月18日“光明日报”上所载两位“宗兄”的谈话。“投降将军”者，宗兄乙赠与宗兄甲祖先章邯的谥号也。
    按照史记的记载：先是“章邯恐”，派出长史欣回朝探听政治行情；继则“章邯狐疑”，当他接到了陈余的劝告；最后没有别条路可走，才投降的。这之前，他是被项羽“九战绝其甬道，大破之”。在西汉演义里有“楚项羽九破章邯”的描写。论打仗，他是很不高明的。
    但章邯背秦降楚，却是义举，不是坏事。所以后来的太史公和更后的小说家对他没有甚么贬辞。这一点，古之章邯还是值得今之“宗兄”效法和另一位“宗兄”参考的。
    在思想战场上，反社会主义的言论一冒头就受到全国人民的迎头痛击，一败涂地。何须待“九战”而后言降！
    史记写“章邯见项羽而流涕”，是真降，不耍两面派手法，贤于今之一个是“心情沉重”挤一点说一点，一个是“心安理得”抗拒批评的一幕双簧——两位宗“兄”。
