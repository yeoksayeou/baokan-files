Xinhua News Agency, June 12th dispatch: TASS reports that the Soviet government told the Lebanese government on June 11th that the Soviet Union cannot violate the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries in order to "curb" the national forces in Lebanon who oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine.
    The Soviet government made this statement in a note that the Soviet Ambassador to Lebanon sent to the Secretary-General of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry on June 11th. This statement is the Soviet government's response to the views recently expressed to the Soviet government by Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik.
    The statement said that the Lebanese Foreign Minister attempted, in an indirect manner, to accuse the Soviet Union of participating in the activities of Lebanese domestic forces who oppose the current government that has accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine, and demanded that the Soviet government exert a "restraining influence" on these forces.
    The statement said that Malik's demand is untenable. "The Soviet Union strictly adheres to the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and believes that the activities of Lebanese domestic social groups are entirely a matter for the Lebanese people themselves."
    The statement pointed out that the reason why Lebanese patriotic forces oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine lies in the nature of the Eisenhower Doctrine itself. The statement said that the purpose of the Eisenhower Doctrine is "to restore the colonial rule system under the protection of the United States in the Near and Middle East." This doctrine "is being used as a means to turn the territories of the Near and Middle Eastern countries into military strategic bases against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries."
    The statement said that it is clear that the Lebanese government's current foreign policy has not received the kind of support within the country that the Lebanese government had hoped to obtain, but what does this have to do with the Soviet Union?
    The statement pointed out that "the Soviet Union is willing to maintain friendly relations with all Arab countries, including Lebanon." The Soviet Union's consistent position, especially during the Suez Canal crisis, has promoted the restoration and maintenance of peace in the Near and Middle East and the assurance of the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries. The Soviet Union hopes to continue to maintain friendly relations with Lebanon in the future, and at the same time does not want to strain the relations between Lebanon or other Arab countries and the United States and other Western countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 12th dispatch: Damascus news: "Al-Rai al-Aam" said that the reason why representatives of the pro-government faction in Lebanon won the elections in Beirut and the South Lebanon Province was due to the Lebanese government and the American agencies in Beirut implementing terror tactics and election fraud.
    The newspaper said that during the election period, the government, under the pretext of re-issuing "lost" voting certificates, distributed 14,000 certificates valid for voting in Beirut among government supporters. In addition, the government removed 35% of voters who supported the opposition from the voter lists. The newspaper also pointed out facts such as vote-buying, arrests, and armed intimidation.
    "Al-Haqq" said on June 11th that last Sunday's Lebanese elections were "fraudulent" and their results may "guarantee the continued pursuit of a policy of subservience to American forces."

　　黎人民反艾森豪威尔主义与苏联何干
　　苏联严斥黎巴嫩政府的无理取闹
　　叙报揭露黎当局勾结美国布设选举骗局
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社讯，苏联政府6月11日向黎巴嫩政府表示，苏联不能违反不干涉他国内政的原则，来“遏制”黎巴嫩国内反对艾森豪威尔主义的民族力量。
    苏联政府通过苏联驻黎巴嫩大使6月11日送给黎巴嫩外交部秘书长的一项声明中作了这样的表示。这项声明是苏联政府对黎巴嫩外交部长马利克最近对苏联政府所提出的意见的答复。
    声明说，黎巴嫩外交部长企图以间接的形式，指责苏联参加黎巴嫩国内力量反对接受了艾森豪威尔主义的现政府的活动，并且要求苏联政府对这些力量起“遏止影响”。
    声明说，马利克这种要求是站不住脚的。“苏联严格遵守不干涉他国内政的政策，并且认为黎巴嫩国内社会团体的活动完全是黎巴嫩人民内部的事情。”
    声明指出，黎巴嫩爱国力量反对艾森豪威尔主义的原因在于艾森豪威尔主义本身的性质。声明说，艾森豪威尔主义的目的是“在中近东恢复美国庇护下的殖民统治制度”。这个主义“正在被用来作为把中近东国家的领土变为反对苏联和其它爱好和平国家的军事战略基地的手段。”
    声明说，显然，黎巴嫩政府目前的外交政策，在国内没有得到黎巴嫩政府所希望获得的那种支持，但这和苏联有什么相干呢？
    声明指出，“苏联愿意同所有阿拉伯国家，其中包括黎巴嫩保持友好关系”。苏联一贯的立场，特别是在苏伊士运河事件时的立场，促进了中近东和平的恢复和保持以及阿拉伯国家独立和主权的确保。苏联希望今后仍然同黎巴嫩保持友好关系，同时也不想使黎巴嫩或其他阿拉伯国家同美国以及其它西方国家的关系紧张化。
    新华社12日讯  大马士革消息：“舆论报”说，黎巴嫩亲政府派的代表在贝鲁特和南黎巴嫩省的选举中所以获胜，是由于黎巴嫩政府和在贝鲁特的美国机关施行恐怖手段和伪造选举的结果。
    这家报纸说，选举期间政府借口补发“遗失”选举权证，在政府拥护者当中散发了一万四千张有权在贝鲁特选举的证件。此外，政府从选民名单中勾除了35％的支持反对派的选民。这家报纸还指出了收买选票、逮捕、武装恐吓等等事实。
    “权利报”6月11日说，上星期日的黎巴嫩选举是“骗人的”，其结果可能是“保证继续奉行屈从美国的势力的政策”。
