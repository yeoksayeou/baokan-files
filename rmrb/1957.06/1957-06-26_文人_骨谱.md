　　"Literati" Bone Chart
　　Shuǐ Níngní
    Yang Yuqing said: "The pen of a literati is naturally against the status quo." Huang Wanli said: "Literati are mostly spineless..." Superficially, it seems like a slap in Yang Yuqing's face, but in terms of the substance of "anti-status quo," these two statements are not different; it's just that Professor Huang's writing style is more refined.
    Of course, people should have bones, but it depends on what kind of bones.
    For example, Wei Yan in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has three rebellious bones on the back of his head. Shouldn't that be a bad kind of bone?
    Let's still take "literati" as an example. "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest." Needless to say, even Wen Yiduo and Zhu Ziqing's hardness of bones against enemies and dark forces can still inspire awe today. But if one is only self-admiring, then one can only develop a pedantic bone, an arrogant bone, a "lofty" bone, feeling that the status quo is unpleasant everywhere; and if one is "cherishing the court in one's heart," being particularly hard on the Communist Party, hard on the people, and hard on socialism, then one will fall into the devil's way, cultivating oneself to be emaciated, like the White Bone Demon in "Journey to the West."
    In fact, the hardness and softness of bones also have class character and two-sidedness. For example, the attitude of the notorious "literati" Hu Shi towards the Chinese revolution might be regarded as belonging to the category of "hardest bones" in the minds of some of our current "literati"? However, Hu Shi's bones were as soft as cotton in front of his American masters, wishing he could become a lump of mud under his master's feet...
    Therefore, I have to sincerely advise those "literati" who consider themselves to have bones, hoping that you carefully examine what kind of bones you have, and you may as well touch the back of your head to see if you have the three rebellious bones of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism.

　　“文人”骨谱
　　水宁尼
    杨玉清说：“文人的笔杆天然是反现状的。”黄万里道：“文人多无骨……”表面上似乎是掌了一下杨玉清的嘴，但就“反现状”的实质而论，这两种说法倒并无二致，只不过黄教授的笔法较为精细罢了。
    人当然应当有骨头，然而也得看是什么样的骨头。
    例如“三国演义”上的魏延，脑后就有三块反骨。它该不是什么好骨头吧？
    还是以“文人”为例罢。“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的。”不必说了，就是闻一多和朱自清，其对敌人和黑暗势力骨头之硬，至今犹能令人肃然起敬。但如果只是一味孤芳自赏，便只能练出一副迂骨、傲骨、“清高”骨，觉得现状处处不顺眼；又如果是“心存魏阙”，专对共产党硬，对人民硬，对社会主义硬，那就更会堕入魔道，练得形销骨立，像“西游记”上的白骨夫人那样了。
    其实骨头的硬软也有阶级性和两面性。例如臭名昭彰的“文人”胡适对中国革命的态度，在咱们目前某些“文人”的心目中说不定还可以列入“骨头最硬”的一类吧？然而胡适的骨头在他的美国主子面前却又其软如绵，恨不得变成主子脚下的一团泥……
    因此我不得不恳切地对那些自命为有骨头的“文人”奉劝几句，希望你们仔细检查一下自己究竟有一副什么骨头，并且不妨摸摸脑后，看有没有反共、反人民、反社会主义的三块反骨。
