    The children of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea receive meticulous care from the state. Since the armistice, Korea has built more than 5,390 schools, accommodating over 2 million students. Children of poor citizens can attend school for free. In the three-year period, more than 2,100 nurseries and more than 400 kindergartens have also been newly built. Now almost all factories and organizations have childcare organizations.
    Many areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have Young Pioneer camps and children's parks. Every summer, many Young Pioneers go to scenic spots to enjoy their holidays in Young Pioneer camps. Last year, more than 40,000 people went to Young Pioneer camps, and this year more people will go, because this year the state's expenditure in this area has increased a lot.

    朝鲜停战后三年中新建二千多托儿所
    本报讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的儿童受到国家无微不至的关怀。停战后，朝鲜已盖起了五千三百九十多所学校，可以容纳学生二百余万人。贫苦公民的孩子可以免费上学。在三年期间还新建了两千一百多个托儿所和四百多个幼儿园。现在各工厂和机关几乎都有托儿组织。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的很多地区都设有少先营和儿童公园。每年夏天，许多少先队员去到风景秀丽的地方在少先营里欢度假日。去年到少先营去的有四万多人，今年去的人会更多，因为今年国家在这方面的支出又增加了很多。
