Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Peiheng reports: Xu Xiaobing, National People's Congress representative and deputy director of the Central Newsreel Film Studio, has returned from inspections in Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other regions and is now conducting inspection work in Beijing. He discovered during his inspections that the most serious problems with the screening and distribution of newsreel films in rural and urban areas are that some films have very few or no opportunities to meet with audiences. In Yangzhou and Zhenjiang prefectures in Jiangsu, he learned that rural areas rarely see new newsreels; some areas do not see new films at all, and the films occasionally shown are old newsreels from last year and the year before. The "New Countryside," which the Newsreel Film Studio specially filmed for rural areas last year, was not printed by the film distribution company at the time, and these films were relegated to the "cold palace" – the warehouse – without ever meeting the farmers. Sometimes, when film distribution companies send out documentaries that are too old to the screening teams, the audience is not happy, and the screening team members also have complaints. Feature films are printed with hundreds of copies each, while newsreels have very few copies printed. Documentaries such as "Soviet Fleet Visits China" were not printed with any copies, and "Guilin Scenery," which won an international honor award, only had two copies printed. "A New Look," which reflects the high tide of socialist transformation in our country, took ten months to produce, but in the end, only one copy was printed.

Serious problems also exist in the distribution and screening of newsreels in some large cities. In Shanghai, the only news cinema among the forty-one cinemas – the Shuguang News Cinema – was also squeezed out. This cinema, located in an inconvenient location, had consistently good attendance rates after being converted into a news cinema. Recently, due to the debate in the drama circles, which demanded performance venues, the Cultural Bureau decided to hand it over to the Film Actors Troupe for drama performances without contacting the cinema. The Beijing Red Star Cinema was originally dedicated to showing newsreels, but the Municipal People's Committee, disregarding the objections of the Film Bureau and the cinema, canceled this news cinema. The Red Star Cinema, which specialized in showing newsreels, screened seven hundred shows in the first quarter of last year. After canceling this cinema and having fifteen cinemas in Beijing add newsreels, only four hundred and sixty shows were screened in the first quarter of this year, and the number of audience members was only half of the same period last year. There are also problems with major city cinemas adding newsreels. In Beijing, Guangzhou, and other places, some cinemas show newsreels with the lights on before screening feature films. Cinemas in Suzhou show newsreels only after the feature film is finished and the audience is gradually leaving. Some cinemas simply store newsreels in warehouses and do not screen them.

The publicity work for newsreel films also has many unreasonable situations. The Shanghai Municipal Cultural Bureau's special film publicity agency rarely or never discusses newsreel publicity issues. Articles introducing and criticizing newsreels are also rarely seen in newspapers and magazines. "Popular Cinema" is a film magazine, but from the stills published in the ninth issue this year, it can be seen that "A Person Who Doesn't Sweat the Small Stuff" is a black-and-white film but uses color plates for the stills, while the documentary "Moving Mountains and Filling the Seas" was originally a color film, but it is printed as a black-and-white still.

Because the above problems have not been resolved for a long time, newsreel filmmakers and the vast majority of creative cadres feel insufficient confidence in their careers and have no prospects. Graduates of the photography class at the Beijing Film Academy are also unwilling to work at the Newsreel Film Studio.

The damage suffered by newsreels in terms of distribution and screening is very serious. He said that the relevant leading departments should be mainly responsible for this problem. He hopes that the relevant leading departments will improve this situation.

### 新闻纪录影片不受社会重视  发行放映等方面都有严重缺点

    新闻纪录影片不受社会重视
    发行放映等方面都有严重缺点
    本报特约稿　新华社记者刘佩珩报道：全国人民代表大会代表、中央新闻纪录电影制片厂副厂长徐肖冰，从江苏、上海等地区视察归来，现在正在北京进行视察工作。他在视察中发现新闻纪录影片在农村城市放映、发行中存在的最严重的问题，是有些影片很少或根本没有和观众见面的机会。他在江苏的扬州、镇江等专区了解到农村很少看到新的新闻纪录片，有的地区根本看不到新片，偶尔放映的片子还是去年和前年的旧闻纪录片。去年新闻纪录电影制片厂专为农村拍摄的“新农村”，电影发行公司当时并未洗印，这些片子没和农民见面就打入了“冷宫”——仓库。有时电影发行公司把一些时间过的太久的纪录片发给放映队时，观众不欢迎，放映队人员也有情绪。故事片每部片子要印数百个拷贝，而新闻纪录片的拷贝却洗印得很少。纪录片如“苏联舰队访问中国”等，没有印拷贝，曾获得国际荣誉奖的“桂林山水”，只印了二个拷贝。反映我国社会主义改造高潮的“万象更新”摄制用了十个月的时间，最后也只印一个拷贝。
    有些大城市里放映发行新闻纪录片也存在着严重的问题。上海四十一家电影院中唯一的一家新闻影院——曙光新闻电影院，还给挤掉了。这个电影院座落在交通不便的一个地方，改为新闻电影院后上座率一直是很好。最近，由于话剧界的争鸣，要求演出阵地，文化局没和影院联系，便决定移交给电影演员剧团演出话剧。北京红星电影院原是专映新闻影片的，但是，市人民委员会不顾电影局、电影院的反对就把这座新闻影院取消了。红星影院专放映新闻纪录片，去年第一季度就放映了七百场；取消这座影院改由北京十五家影院加映新闻纪录片后，今年第一季度才放映四百六十场，观众人次仅达去年同时期的一半。各大城市影院加演新闻纪录片时也存在问题。北京、广州等地有的电影院在放映故事片前，加演新闻片时是开着灯放映的。苏州的影院是放映完故事片观众陆续出场时才放映新闻纪录片。还有些影院干脆把新闻纪录片存入仓库不放映。
    新闻纪录影片的宣传工作也存在很多不合理的情况。上海市文化局专门对电影进行宣传的机构，很少或根本不谈新闻片宣传的问题。在报纸杂志上也经常看不到介绍和批评新闻片的文章。“大众电影”是电影专刊，但从今年第九期刊登的剧照就可看出，“不拘小节的人”是黑白片而用彩色板制剧照，纪录片“移山填海”原是彩色片，却把它印成黑白剧照。
    由于上述问题长期得不到解决，新闻电影摄制人员和绝大部分的创作干部对自己的事业感到信心不足，没有奔头。北京电影学院摄影班毕业的学员，也不愿到新闻纪录电影制片厂工作。
    目前新闻影片在发行、放映等方面所受到的摧残，十分严重。他说，这个问题主要应由有关领导部门负责。希望有关领导部门加以改进。
