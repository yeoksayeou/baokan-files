Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: The Central Standing Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy held an enlarged meeting this morning and passed a resolution on carrying out a rectification movement within the association.

Thirty-six people attended the meeting, including central committee members in Beijing, alternate central committee members, heads of central departments, and heads of local organizations who came to Beijing to participate in the National People's Congress.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Wang Shao'ao. At the beginning of the meeting, Secretary-General Yang Dongchun conveyed the instructions of Chairman Ma Xulun (absent due to illness). Yang Dongchun said that Ma Xulun believes that the rectification of democratic parties is very important, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy should start immediately. The current anti-rightist struggle is essentially a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy should participate in this struggle, which is a good opportunity to exercise themselves, improve themselves, and conduct self-remolding. Yang Dongchun said that Ma Xulun also humbly asked everyone for their opinions, believing that his speeches and actions in the past few years also had errors and was willing to accept everyone's criticism.

Seventeen people spoke at the meeting one after another. In their speeches, they unanimously expressed their support for Ma Xulun's proposal and agreed to carry out a rectification movement in the entire association.

Central Standing Committee member Wu Yifang said, "We shouldn't think that the China Association for Promoting Democracy has always been progressive. In fact, it is worth checking whether our position is firm and whether our thinking is free of problems." Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Preparatory Committee Che Xiangchen said that the China Association for Promoting Democracy is developing rapidly and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no right-wing elements. We should use the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in his speech to carefully examine our words and deeds and test ourselves through the rectification movement. Vice Chairman Lin Handa believes that the ideological remolding of intellectuals in the past only distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and now we need to further conduct socialist education. He said that most intellectuals are patriotic, but patriotic people do not necessarily love socialism. This rectification movement should provide profound socialist education to the vast number of members to improve themselves.

Central Standing Committee member Lei Jieqiong and others pointed out in their speeches that the rectification movement within the association should start with the central leaders, with the main content being the rectification of reactionary remarks against socialism, against the leadership of the Communist Party, and against the dictatorship of the proletariat. The principle of combining seriousness and gentleness should be adopted.

Central Standing Committee member Wu Yanren reviewed his mistakes in his speech. He said, "My speech at the forum of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee was wrong. I disagree with the statement that the wall should be demolished on both sides, and I think that we should not emphasize the ideological remolding of intellectuals now. This overestimates the intellectuals, and now it seems to be wrong." He said that he would carefully examine his words and deeds in this rectification.

Finally, all members passed the Resolution on Carrying out Rectification Movement within the Association.

The resolution stated: "In the current period of great social changes, although the large-scale mass class struggle has basically ended, the class struggle still exists. Among the members of our association, due to their non-proletarian origins, it is inevitable that there will be varying degrees of unaccustomedness or even resistance to the socialist system. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately carry out a rectification movement in the entire association to strictly draw a line between the right-wing anti-socialist and anti-Communist Party leadership thoughts, launch an irreconcilable struggle, and enable the members of our association to distinguish right from wrong, correct their positions, and better contribute to the socialist cause of our country through this movement."

The resolution pointed out: "The content of the rectification within the association should be based on the six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in his speech 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People.' The most important of these six criteria are the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party. Thoughts, remarks, and actions that do not meet these six criteria should be criticized and corrected."

The resolution stated that the rectification within the association should start with the central leading organs and the leading organs of various provinces and cities.

Finally, the resolution proposed that after the rectification is started within the association, members should continue to offer opinions to the Party and sincerely help the Party in its rectification. The organizations at all levels of our association should also actively strive for Party organizations and Party members to offer opinions to our association to help us in our rectification. During the rectification within the association, organizations at all levels should temporarily stop recruiting members and developing organizations.

    民主党派进行整风是成员们自我改造的好机会
    民主促进会中央常委会通过整风决议
    新华社23日讯　中国民主促进会中央常务委员会今天上午举行扩大会议，通过了关于进行会内整风运动的决议。
    出席这次会议的有在京的中央委员、候补中央委员、中央各工作部门负责人及来北京参加全国人民代表大会的各地方组织负责人等共三十六人。
    会议由副主席王绍鏊主持。会议开始，秘书长杨东蒪传达了主席马叙伦（因病缺席）的指示。杨东蒪说，马叙伦认为，民主党派的整风很重要，民进应立即开始。现在反右派斗争，实质上是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，民进成员要投入这场斗争，这正是锻炼自己，提高自己，进行自我改造的一个很好机会。杨东蒪说，马叙伦还虚心要大家提意见，认为这几年来他的言论和行动也有错误的地方，愿意接受大家的批评。
    在会上先后发言的有十七人。他们在发言中一致表示拥护马叙伦的建议，赞成在全会进行一次整风运动。
    中央常务委员吴贻芳说，我们不要以为民进一向进步，事实上我们的立场是否坚定，思想是否没有毛病，值得检查。副主席兼辽宁省筹委会主委车向忱说，民进的组织发展很快，很难保证没有右派分子，我们应以毛主席讲话中提出的六项标准好好来检查自己的言行，通过整风运动来考验自己。副主席林汉达认为过去知识分子的思想改造还仅仅是分清敌我界限，现在要进一步进行社会主义教育。他说，知识分子大多都是爱国的，但爱国的人不一定爱社会主义，这次整风运动就要使广大成员受到深刻的社会主义教育来提高自己。
    中央常务委员雷洁琼等人在发言中都指出会内的整风运动应先从中央的领导人开始，以整反对社会主义、反对共产党领导和反对无产阶级专政的反动言行为主要内容。并应采取严肃认真与和风细雨相结合的原则。
    中央常务委员吴研因在发言中检讨了自己的错误，他说，我在中央统战部座谈会上的发言是错误的。我不同意墙要两面拆的说法，认为现在不要强调知识分子的思想改造，这是把知识分子估计过高了，现在看来是错误的。他表示在这次整风中要好好检查自己的言行。
    最后，全体通过了关于会内进行整风运动的决议。
    决议说：在目前社会大变动的时期，大规模的群众性的阶级斗争虽然已经基本结束，但阶级斗争仍属存在。在我会成员中，由于非无产阶级的出身，对社会主义制度存在着不同程度的不习惯乃至抵触的情绪，也是必然的。因此有必要立即在全会进行整风运动，同右派反社会主义、反共产党领导的思想严格划清界限，展开不调和的斗争，使我会成员通过这次运动明辨是非，端正立场，更好地为我国的社会主义事业贡献力量。
    决议指出：会内整风的内容，应该以毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中所提出的六项政治标准为依据。这六条标准中最重要的是社会主义道路和共产党的领导两条，对不合这六项标准的思想、言论和行动，都应加以批驳和纠正。
    决议说，会内整风，先在中央领导机构和各省、市领导机构做起。
    最后，决议提出，在会内开始整风之后，会员仍然应该继续向党提意见，诚恳地帮助党整风。我会各级组织也应该主动地争取党组织和党员向我会提意见，帮助我们整风。在会内整风期间，各级组织应暂时停止吸收会员、发展组织。
