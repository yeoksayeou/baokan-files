Xinhua News Agency, Miluo, 2nd. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the people along the Miluo River in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, held a "Dragon Boat Race Meeting to Commemorate the Great Patriotic Poet Qu Yuan of Our Country." Today the weather was clear, and on the Miluo River downstream for over a hundred li, dragon boats were everywhere, drums and gongs resounded, and nearly 30,000 male and female peasants, young and old, put on their holiday clothes early in the morning and gathered on the riverbank to watch the dragon boat race. According to statistics from Miluo River and Heshi townships alone, more than 30 dragon boats enthusiastically launched rowing races on the Miluo River downstream at Qu Tan, Heshi, Chensha Port and other places.

The Miluo River is located in the northern part of Xiangyin County. More than two thousand years ago, Qu Yuan drowned himself here. Nearby are Qu Yuan's tomb and the Quzi Temple built by the local people in memory of him. It is said that Qu Yuan was exiled here and wrote great poems such as "Li Sao" and "Nine Songs." Yesterday, on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival, the oarsmen of the dragon boats preparing to participate in the competition within a few dozen li had all come here to worship at the temple. From morning to night, the temple was filled with firecrackers and gongs and drums all day long, and the surrounding people flocked to participate in the temple worship ceremony like a tide. Many primary and middle school students also came to the temple to perform dragon boat dances, recite folk poems commemorating Qu Yuan, or sweep Qu Yuan's tomb.

    锣鼓喧天百里江面泛龙舟
    汨罗江农民纪念诗人屈原
    新华社汨罗2日电　今天是端午节，湖南省湘阴县汨罗江畔人民举行了“纪念我国伟大爱国诗人屈原的龙舟竞赛大会”。今天天气晴朗，汨罗江下游百余里长的江面上，到处龙舟如织，锣鼓喧天，近三万的男女老少农民，一清早就穿上节日服装，齐集江岸参观龙舟竞赛。仅据汨水，河市两个乡统计，就有三十多条龙舟在汨罗江下游的屈潭、河市、沉沙港等地江面上热烈展开了划船竞赛。
    汨罗江在湘阴县北部，两千多年前屈原在这里投江自杀，附近有屈原墓和当地人民为纪念他而建的屈子祠。相传屈原放逐居此，并在此作“离骚”、“九歌”等伟大诗篇。昨天端午节前夕，附近几十里内准备下水参加竞赛的龙舟的桡手们都曾先到这里来朝庙。从早到晚，庙内整天炮竹、锣鼓，热闹非常，附近人们像潮水般涌来参加朝庙仪式。许多中小学生也到庙里来表演龙船舞，朗诵民间流传纪念屈原的诗歌，或者到屈原坟前扫墓。
