Teachers Wang Jinding and Others of Renmin University of China Speak Out
Draw a Clear Ideological Line with Ge Peiqi

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Renmin University of China continued to invite non-Party professors, associate professors, and lecturers to a forum on the afternoons of June 5th and 7th. Eleven people spoke successively. At the meeting, some people criticized the school leadership and also criticized Ge Peiqi's erroneous ideas.

    Wu Jingchao said: Party Committee leadership of the school is unshakeable. The current issue is not whether to have Party Committee leadership, but how to strengthen Party Committee leadership.

    Wu Jingchao said that the principle of Party Committee leadership of the school is, in my opinion, unshakeable. To not recognize Party Committee leadership is to not recognize the leadership of the Communist Party, and without the Party's leadership, our actions will lose direction. The current issue, I believe, is not whether to have Party Committee leadership, but how to strengthen Party Committee leadership. The way to strengthen Party Committee leadership is to maintain close ties with the masses, listen to their opinions, and accept their supervision.

    In the past, the Party Committee of Renmin University did not do enough in this regard. Most of our democratic parties, non-Party teachers, and students have never been invited to offer their opinions. Since last year, we have begun to take a more active interest in school affairs, but traditional habits cannot be changed overnight. The things we can be involved in are still very few. But we are not discouraged, and we hope that one day, our sense of ownership can truly be established. What we have always strived for is to ask the school to establish some committees, especially important ones such as a finance committee and a teaching staff appointment committee. These committees would only be research-oriented and advisory, regularly conducting investigations and research on certain aspects of the school's issues, and making recommendations based on this work. With these committees as assistants, the school Party Committee and administration will only do their work better, and no adverse effects will arise.

    Li Jinghan said: Old intellectuals love the motherland and hope to be given appropriate working conditions.

    Li Jinghan hoped that the Party would change the impression that we can catch up with the world's advanced scientific level quickly. He said that after the restructuring of departments and faculties, old intellectuals were placed in new positions. The leadership once said that one could become a small expert in a few months and a large expert in a few years. In my opinion, it takes at least one or two decades to embark on an academic path, let alone catch up with the advanced level. Not only natural sciences, but also social sciences require many years to become an expert. So, who should we rely on? We should rely on old intellectuals. Can we catch up with the world level in ten years? I don't think so. It was a little late to start using old intellectuals, because before liberation, people like Zhao Xiyu and Dai Shiguang's accounting statistics were not far from the world level, but after eight years of isolation from the outside world, they have inevitably become unfamiliar with the latest developments. I believe that if old intellectuals are given the conditions, they will be willing to work in a pragmatic manner. I absolutely believe that these people love the motherland and are worthy of the Party's trust in them.

    Ge Peiqi continues to publish anti-communist remarks.

    Ge Peiqi said that even now, the masses still have concerns about "blooming and contending," which specifically reflects the masses' distrust of the Communist Party's words. The Communist Party should pay special attention to this because "a government cannot stand without the trust of the people." I want to repeat that the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill Communists. If you do not change, do not try to prove yourselves, and continue to become corrupt, then you will inevitably go down this road, and that day will eventually come. This is also in line with the laws of socialist development. It is useless to just shout "Long live!"

    He said, why don't the masses trust the Communist Party? Because the masses have experienced the Communist Party's changeability in the past eight years. For example, last year, the central government issued instructions to take care of senior intellectuals, and the school administration sent civil servants to deliver food and water. This year, to implement streamlining and savings, the civil servants were canceled. The Party organization, when it finds someone useful, treats those who have killed friends, comrades, and Party members as treasures; when they are no longer useful, they shut those who have shed blood and sweat outside the door, cold as ice. Some Party members are unconcerned with their relatives, and even a son doesn't get close to his father. A son who joins the Party sends a letter to his mother calling her "Comrade." These examples show that it is completely reasonable for the masses to distrust the Communist Party.

    He also said that in 1949, the masses would not have had so many opinions about the Communist Party. If the "three evils" are not eradicated, the tide will collapse. The possibility of reversing the collapse is to eliminate the "three evils," and another possibility is to be swept away by the tide and buried in the belly of the fish.

    Wang Jinding said: We must draw a clear line with the kind of thinking represented by Ge Peiqi.

    Wang Jinding said that we criticize Party members because we eagerly hope that their level of Marxism-Leninism will be further improved, and we demand that Party members have a stronger Party spirit. We hope that the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the entire Chinese people, will be stronger and more consolidated.

    With this common desire, even if we have divergent opinions in the discussion, we have a common language as a foundation. But here, I also heard someone say that we should not adopt a friendly attitude towards the Party's rectification campaign. He once said: "The Communist Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a mess," "The supply of goods is tight," "The living standards of the people have declined," "It's not good, the masses can overthrow you, kill Communists, and overthrow you." He believes that the rectification campaign is the time to settle accounts with the Party. The person who said these things is Ge Peiqi, a lecturer in the Department of Industrial Economics. A person can find all kinds of excuses to express his thoughts and feelings about things he hates and things he is hostile to. I don't think this is at all surprising. But every person who supports the Communist Party has a full reason to oppose any excuse made by Ge Peiqi. I believe that the comrades present know how to draw a clear line with the kind of thinking represented by Ge Peiqi. I also believe that the students of Renmin University, like the entire Chinese people, understand what it means when he says during the Party's rectification campaign, "If there is no Communist Party leadership, others will not sell the country." We must not lose our due sobriety because we are criticizing certain shortcomings or mistakes within the Party, while at the same time, we are losing sight of the meaning of Ge Peiqi's views.

    Yang Chengzuo said that criticism of the Party is for the future of the country, not for attack, and we cannot use the "great blooming and contending" to vent personal grievances.

    Yang Chengzuo said that the school has already launched a "great blooming and contending," and most people are helping the Party to rectify its work out of a concern for the Communist Party. Why? Because the Communist Party is the people's Party, and it represents the people's will. Criticism of the Party should proceed from a concern for the Party, and only by adopting this attitude is it correct. But some people do not speak with this attitude. Some people say, "The Communist Party does all kinds of evil." We cannot imagine, if there were no Communist Party, who could lead the people to overthrow the three major enemies of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, and complete the new democratic revolution? Who could lead the Chinese people to make amazing achievements? Some people say, "The Communist Party is worse than Chiang Kai-shek." This is wrong! If the Chinese Communist Party withdrew from the political stage, Chiang Kai-shek would be restored, the landlords would be restored, the clutches of imperialism would extend, and China would be plunged into darkness. Therefore, we must not deny the leadership of the Party, and we must not deny the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Sharp criticism of the Party should be convincing, criticism is for the future of the country, not for attack, sharpness should be appropriate, do not confuse right and wrong, and cannot use the "great blooming and contending" to vent personal grievances. Otherwise, it will violate the spirit of "great blooming and contending."

    Zhao Yumin expressed his firm opposition to Ge Peiqi's views.

    Zhao Yumin said that some people believe that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was the Party rectifying us, and this time it is the masses rectifying the Party." This statement is incorrect. In the past, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was the Party and the people together eliminating counter-revolutionaries, which was a matter of dealing with the enemy; this rectification campaign is to resolve contradictions among the people. He said, I firmly oppose Ge Peiqi's views. Ge Peiqi's statement that "the unified purchase and sales system was a mess" is one-sided. The unified purchase and sales system fundamentally cut off the connection between urban and rural capitalism and promoted the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. How can it be said that it was a mess? Where has Ge Peiqi's socialist position gone? Any remarks that deviate from socialism are wrong.

### 中国人民大学教师汪金丁等发言  要跟葛佩琦划清思想界限

    中国人民大学教师汪金丁等发言
    要跟葛佩琦划清思想界限
    本报讯　中共中国人民大学委员会在6月5日、7日两天下午继续邀请党外教授、副教授、讲师座谈，先后发言的有十一人。会上有些人对学校领导提出批评，也对葛佩琦的错误思想进行了批判。
      吴景超说：党委领导学校是不可动摇的。目前不是要不要党委领导的问题，而是如何加强党委领导的问题
    吴景超说，党委领导学校这一原则，我认为是不可动摇的，不承认党委领导，就是不承认共产党的领导，而没有党的领导，我们的行动就会迷失方向。目前的问题，我以为不是要不要党委领导的问题，而是如何加强党委领导的问题。加强党委领导的道路就是经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。
    过去，人民大学党委会在这方面是做得不够的。我们大多数民主党派，非党教员、学生，从来没有被邀去征询过意见。自去年以来，我们开始对于校务采取了积极过问的态度，但是传统的习惯不是一朝一夕所能改变过来的。我们能够过问的事还很少。但是我们并不灰心，希望总有一天，我们的主人翁感觉真正能够树立起来。我们一向所努力的，就是要求学校设立一些委员会，特别重要的，就是成立财务委员会，以及教学人员聘任委员会。这些委员会只是研究性的，谘询性的，对于学校某些方面的问题，经常进行些调查研究工作，并在这种工作基础上，提出建议，学校党委和行政，有这些委员会作助手，只会把工作做好，而不会产生任何坏的影响。
    李景汉说：旧知识分子是爱祖国的，希望给以适当工作条件
    李景汉希望党把追上世界先进科学水平的印象改变一下。他说，院系调整以后，旧知识分子放到新岗位上。领导上曾说过，几个月可成为小专家，几年可成为大专家。我看，一二十年最多是走上学术之路，更不用说赶上先进水平。不仅自然科学，就是社会科学也需要多年的时间才能成为专家。那么要依靠些什么人呢？依靠旧知识分子。十年能赶上世界水平吗？我看不能，起用旧知识分子稍微晚了一点，因为他们在解放前，如赵锡禹、戴世光的会计统计是和世界水平差不远的，但八年与外界隔绝，因此未免生疏。我相信如果给予旧知识分子以条件，他一定会愿意实事求是地来工作。我绝对相信这些人是爱祖国的，对得起党对他们的信任。
    葛佩琦继续发表反共言论
    葛佩琦说，至今群众对鸣放还有顾虑，具体反映了群众对共产党的话不敢信任，共产党对这一点应特别重视。因为，“民无信不立”。我还要重述一遍，群众是要推翻共产党，杀共产党人，若你们再不改，不争口气，腐化下去，那必走这条道路，总有那么一天。这也是合乎社会主义发展规律的，只空喊万岁也是没有用的。
    他说，群众为什么不敢信任共产党呢？因为群众在八年中体会到共产党善变，如去年中央指示照顾高级知识分子，校部派公务员送饭送水，今年实行精简节约，又取消了公务员。党组织对人，认为有用时，把杀过朋友、杀过同志、杀过党内人的人都当作宝贝；不用时，把对流过血和汗的人关在大门之外，冷若冰霜。有些党员六亲不认，连儿子同爸爸都不接近，儿子入党给妈妈来信称同志。这些事例说明，群众不信任共产党是完全合乎情理的。
    他又说，1949年群众对共产党不会有这么多意见。三害不铲除，狂澜既倒，挽狂澜既倒的可能是除三害，另一个可能被狂澜冲走，葬身鱼腹。
    汪金丁说，要同葛佩琦所代表的那种思想划清界限
    汪金丁说，我们批评党员，是因为我们热望他们的马克思列宁主义的水平更加提高，要求党员的党性更强。我们希望领导全中国人民的中国共产党，这个核心更加强大、更加巩固。
    有了这种共同的愿望，即使在讨论中我们有分歧的意见，但我们是有共同语言做基础的。但是就在这里，我也听到有人提出这样的一种意见：我们不要采取朋友的态度对待党的整风。他曾经说：“共产党的肃反运动搞糟了”、“物资供应紧张了”、“老百姓生活水平下降了”、“不好，群众可以打倒你们，杀共产党人，推翻你们”。他认为整风的时候，就是向党算帐的时候。说这些话的人，就是工业经济系的讲师葛佩琦。一个人对他憎恶的事物，他所敌视的事物，是可以找出各种各样的借口，来表达他的思想感情的。我觉得这完全无足奇怪。但是每个拥护共产党的人，也有充分的理由，来反对葛佩琦的任何借口。我相信在座的同志，都知道怎样同葛佩琦所代表的那种思想划清界限。我更相信人民大学的同学和全体中国人民一样，是理解在党的整风期间，他提出“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”的这种说法是有什么涵义的。我们决不能因为在批评党内某些缺点或错误的同时，对葛佩琦的这种意见，失掉了我们应有的清醒。
    杨承祚说，对党的批评是为了国家的前途，不是为了攻击，不能借大鸣大放泄私愤
    杨承祚说，学校已经大鸣大放，多数人是从爱护共产党的心情出发，帮助党整风。为什么呢？因为共产党是人民的党，它代表人民的意志。对党的批评要从爱护党的心情出发，只有采取这种态度才是正确的。但是有人不是用这种态度讲话的。有人说，“共产党无恶不作。”我们不可设想，如果没有共产党，谁能领导人民打倒帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义这三大敌人，完成新民主主义革命呢？谁能领导中国人民作出惊人的事迹呢？有人说“共产党比蒋介石还坏。”这是错误的！假如中国共产党退出政治舞台，蒋介石就会复辟，地主就会复辟，帝国主义的魔掌就会伸进来，中国就会暗无天日。因此，绝不能否认党的领导，不能否认无产阶级专政。
    对党提出尖锐的批评，应当使人心悦诚服，批评是为了国家的前途，不是为了攻击，尖锐应当恰如其分，不要混淆是非，不能借大鸣大放泄私愤。不然，就是违背大放大鸣的精神。
      赵玉珉表示坚决反对葛佩琦的观点
    赵玉珉说，有人认为“肃反是党整我们，这次是群众整党。”这种说法是不对的。过去肃反是党和人民一道肃清反革命，是对待敌人的问题；这次整风是解决人民内部的矛盾。他说，我对于葛佩琦的观点，坚决反对。葛佩琦所说的“统购统销搞糟了”，是片面的。统购统销从根本上斩断了城乡资本主义的联系，推动了资本主义工商业的改造，这怎能说是搞糟了呢？葛佩琦的社会主义立场跑到那里去了？一切离开社会主义的言论是错误的。
