　　Boycotting the Canal is Not a Long-Term Solution
　　France Bows to Egypt

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th dispatch from Paris: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman announced on June 13th that the French government has decided to permit French ships to pass through the Suez Canal. France is the last country to remove its “boycott” of the canal.

The spokesman said that, through Swiss intermediation, France has reached an agreement with Egypt, agreeing to pay the canal passage fees to the Egyptian authorities in freely convertible pounds sterling.

One of France's largest shipping companies, "Messageries Maritimes," announced in Marseille on the same day that its regular liners and freighters to the Far East would use the Suez Canal from June 21st. Since the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt last November, French ships to the Far East have been detouring around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa.

　　抵制运河终非久计
　　法国向埃及低头
    新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人6月13日宣布，法国政府已经决定准许法国船只通过苏伊士运河。法国是最后一个取消对运河“抵制”的国家。
    发言人说，通过瑞士的居间，法国已经同埃及达成协议，同意用可以自由兑换的那种英镑向埃及当局支付运河通航费。
    法国最大的轮船公司之一“海洋航运公司”同一天在马赛宣布，它驶往远东的定期轮船和货船将从6月21日起利用苏伊士运河。自从去年11月英法侵略埃及以来，法国到远东的船只一直绕道非洲的好望角。
