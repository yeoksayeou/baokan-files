Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 3rd. The Hungarian National Assembly held its second session of the year starting on the 3rd. The central topic was the national economy. At the meeting on the 3rd, the Director of the Hungarian National Planning Bureau, Kish Apad, delivered a report on the 1957 National Economic Plan, and the Minister of Finance, Antos Istvan, delivered a report on the 1957 National Budget.

According to Kish's report on the 3rd, the main task of Hungary's 1957 economic plan is to ensure the stability of the national economy, establish a commodity fund necessary to improve the living standards of the working people based on existing power and raw material resources, and implement measures that enable foreign trade to achieve a surplus.

Kish said that this year's national income will be 9% less than the planned figure for last year, that is, 9 billion forints (Hungarian currency), but 2 billion forints more than the actual figure completed last year. Residents' consumption will increase by more than 6%.

He said that the total value of industrial products planned for this year will reach 68.7 billion forints, an increase of 2.4% over last year. Among them, the production of the food industry and light industry will increase by 9%.

This year's agricultural production will increase by 3%, of which pasture grass will increase by 7%. One of the important tasks of this year's agricultural production is to further consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

Kish pointed out that this year's total retail sales will increase by 16.5% compared with 1955 and 4.5% compared with last year. Among them, the proportion of industrial products will increase significantly, and building materials will increase by 35%. National reserves will be reduced by 30% compared with the average figure of the past few years, and the total investment will be 8.2 billion forints.

Kish pointed out that this year's plan was formulated based on the current situation. Due to the further improvement of the production situation, the plan may be overfulfilled. He emphasized that maintaining the current standard of living will remain a difficult task this year and in the future. It is impossible to rely on the assistance of fraternal countries forever. We must make every effort to better use these loans for production. In addition, we must also pay attention to improving living standards, eliminate the phenomenon of import surplus more quickly, and increase basic investment. Although there are still difficulties this year, the balance of the national economy can be guaranteed due to the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

According to the report made by Finance Minister Antos at the meeting, this year's budget revenue is 52.6 billion forints, and expenditure is 51.8 billion forints. Of the budget expenditure, 7.8 billion forints will be allocated to compensate for the losses of state-owned enterprises and enterprise bonuses. State agencies will spend 1.7 billion forints less than last year, defense and administrative expenditures will be reduced by 2.6 billion forints, and expenditures on social, cultural and health facilities will increase by 900 million forints compared with last year. In addition, 300 million forints will be allocated as loans for production cooperatives.

At the meeting on the 4th, the above two reports were discussed, and thirteen members spoke.

    保证经济稳定和提高人民生活水平
    匈牙利政府提出今年经济任务
    据新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利国民议会今年第二次会议3日开始举行。中心议题是国民经济问题。在3日会议上，匈牙利国家计划局局长基什·阿帕德作了关于1957年度国民经济计划的报告，财政部长安托什·伊斯特万作了关于1957年度国家预算的报告。
    根据基什3日在会上所作的报告，匈牙利1957年经济计划的主要任务，在于保证国民经济的稳定，在现有动力和原料资源的基础上设立为提高劳动人民生活水平所必需的商品基金，实行能使对外贸易达到顺差的措施。
    基什说，今年国民收入将比去年计划规定的少9％，即九十亿福林（匈币），但比去年实际完成的数字要多二十亿福林。居民的消费量将增加6％以上。
    他说，今年计划生产的工业产品总值将达六百八十七亿福林，比去年增加2.4％。其中食品工业和轻工业的生产将增加9％。
    今年的农业生产将增加3％，其中牧草将增加7％。今年农业生产的重要任务之一是进一步巩固农业生产合作社。
    基什指出，今年商品零售总额将比1955年增加16.5％，比去年增加4.5％。其中工业品比例将大大增加，建筑材料将增加35％。国家储备比以往几年的平均数字减少30％，投资方面共计八十二亿福林。
    基什指出，今年的计划是根据目前的情况拟定的。由于生产情况的进一步好转，计划有可能超额完成。他强调说，维持目前的生活水平，在今年和以后仍然是困难的任务。不能够永远依靠兄弟国家的援助。必须尽一切努力更好地运用这些贷款来进行生产。另外还要注意提高生活水平，要更快地消除入超的现象和增加基本投资。今年虽然还有困难，但由于有苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助，可以保证国民经济的平衡。
    根据财政部长安托什在会上作的报告，今年预算收入是五百二十六亿福林，支出是五百一十八亿福林。预算支出中将拨出七十八亿福林作为弥补国家企业损失和企业奖金之用。国家机关将比去年少开支十七亿福林，国防和行政支出将缩减二十六亿福林，而对社会文化和卫生设施的开支将比去年增加九亿福林。另外还拨出三亿福林作为生产合作社贷款。
    4日会议讨论上述两个报告，有议员十三人发言。
