Dispersed Feeding of Draught Animals: Well-Fed and Strong
Many Agricultural Cooperatives Across the Country Implement Dispersed Feeding Methods for Draught Cattle

This newspaper reports: Many agricultural production cooperatives across the country have implemented dispersed feeding methods for draught cattle, and have achieved significant results. Compared with centralized feeding methods, it can be affirmed that this approach is more conducive to protecting and developing draught cattle. In provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Sichuan, where dispersed feeding of draught cattle is relatively common, whether in mountainous or plain areas, disaster-stricken or non-disaster-stricken areas, severely affected or lightly affected areas, draught cattle are generally healthier, and there is also a certain increase in the number of young livestock. In Hubei Province in 1955, there were more than 2,718,300 head of various livestock. In the first year of cooperation, this number increased to more than 2,918,700 head, with a net increase rate of 7%. In Hunan Province in 1955, there were more than 2,746,900 head of various livestock throughout the province. Despite suffering from disasters last year, the number still increased to more than 2,854,600 head, with a net increase rate of 3%. Currently, in many areas, the masses have recognized the benefits of dispersed feeding of draught cattle. Agricultural cooperatives that have not raised their collectively fed draught animals well and are indeed unable to reverse the weakened state of draught cattle in a short period have already implemented or are in the process of implementing dispersed feeding. Some cooperatives have quickly achieved obvious results after adopting dispersed feeding methods. For example, the Tianzhuang Village production team of Lianfeng Second Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, had a total of 51 draught animals. When the draught animals were originally fed centrally, the weakened condition was quite serious. At that time, there were four head each in the first and second grades of fatness, and forty-three head in the third grade of fatness. Less than fifty days after implementing dispersed feeding, the number of first-grade fatness rose to nine head, the second-grade fatness rose to twenty head, the third-grade fatness dropped to twenty-one head, and one death occurred. When draught animals were fed centrally in Suiping County, Henan Province, the average daily abnormal death rate was seven head in December of last year, with the total number of deaths for the month accounting for 1.59% of the total number of heads. After changing to dispersed feeding this year, there were twenty deaths in March, accounting for 0.15% of the total number of heads.

  Many Benefits of Dispersed Feeding of Draught Animals
    The reason why dispersed feeding can quickly reverse the weakened and dying situation of draught cattle is that: in the early stages of establishing agricultural cooperatives, dispersed feeding indeed has more convenient conditions than centralized feeding. To sum up, the benefits of dispersed feeding are as follows:

    First, it can closely integrate the collective interests of the cooperative with the personal interests of the members, and enhance the enthusiasm of the members to love, protect, and increase livestock. For example, in Lianfeng Second Cooperative of Changge County, Henan Province, many draught animals were skin and bones when fed centrally; after dispersed feeding, the weakened condition of draught animals improved. Cao Guirong, a member of the cooperative, was assigned three animals that were on the verge of death. After his meticulous care, they all recovered their health in less than fifty days.

    Second, it can reduce the cash expenditure of the cooperative in building large-scale livestock sheds and can make use of the original livestock sheds and tools of the members. This not only takes care of the historical habits of the masses in raising draught cattle but also conforms to the current leadership level of agricultural cooperatives and the technical level of breeders, which is beneficial to both the cooperative and its members.

    Third, draught cattle do not crowd each other, do not bite each other randomly; it is easy for breeders to take care of them, the fodder can be fed evenly, and they can drink enough water; diseases are not easy to occur, and even if they do occur, they are easy to detect and can be sealed off, isolated, and treated in time, so as not to spread into disasters. According to a survey in Wuyang County, Henan Province, among the twenty-four townships in the county where draught animals are fed centrally, there are more than 32,000 head of livestock in total. Due to poor feeding, 5,533 head have died since the beginning of spring, accounting for 17.3% of the total number of heads. In the twenty-nine agricultural cooperatives where draught animals are fed in a dispersed manner, there are more than 31,000 head of livestock in total. Due to careful feeding, only one hundred and thirty head have died since the beginning of spring, accounting for 0.42% of the total number of heads.

    Fourth, the proximity of homes and sheds facilitates the care of draught cattle by breeders. Whether day or night, windy or rainy, breeders can add grass and feed to the draught cattle on time. With more people in the members' families caring about the draught cattle, the draught cattle can also benefit from the members' families, and vegetable soup and dishwashing water can be used as feed. The connection between home and shed is conducive to keeping the draught cattle warm and resistant to the cold in winter, enhancing their resistance; it enables the breeders to fully understand the character traits of the draught cattle and to grasp the labor, feeding, rest, rumination, and presence or absence of disease of the draught cattle at any time, avoiding deviations such as random pulling and overuse. For example, Li Shaozhong, a member of Guangming First Cooperative in Shenzhai Township, Suiping County, Henan Province, warmed the fire, rubbed grass for food, and warmed the water for drinking for a very weak donkey he was assigned to feed. In more than twenty days, the donkey recovered its health.

    Fifth, dispersed feeding not only allows strong laborers to be responsible for care, but many women and children can also help with feeding and grazing.

    Sixth, it is easier to bed and remove manure, not only is the environmental hygiene of the draught cattle good, but also the timely mating and breeding of calves is convenient, and more fertilizer can be accumulated.

  Specific Methods of Dispersed Feeding
    The specific method of dispersed feeding is mainly that draught animals are collectively owned and fed by individual households. There are usually three situations: First, all the livestock of the cooperative or team are matched into pairs according to gender, size, and speed of work, and distributed to households for feeding by pair. Some of the original livestock are returned to the original owners, and the original livestock are used in the original pens. Some are dispersed to several households. Second, old, disabled, sick, weak, and young livestock are dispersed to households for feeding. Third, livestock needed for the family life of the members are distributed to the members for feeding. There are basically two forms of feeding by individual households. One is called "complete contracting." For example, in the Liantang Cooperative in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, draught cattle are fixed for feeding by designated personnel, the feed is purchased by the breeders, and the breeders receive all the benefits of fattening and increasing the draught cattle, and the breeders are responsible for the losses caused by poor feeding and weight loss, and the agricultural cooperative gives a certain rent according to the quantity and quality of the draught cattle's labor. The advantage of doing this is that it can promote the breeders' awareness of caring for draught cattle. The other is called "contracting labor and feeding, rewarding for overproduction." The content of contracting labor and feeding generally includes setting (contracting) fodder, setting (contracting) work points, setting (contracting) livestock fatness, and setting (contracting) reproduction. The agricultural cooperative sets the quota for contracting labor and feeding for each draught animal and contracts it to the breeders for feeding. If the feeding is good and exceeds the quota, a reward is given; if the feeding is not good and is lower than the quota, compensation is given depending on the situation. The medical expenses required for the illness of the draught cattle are borne by the cooperative or team.

    Some cooperatives have also adopted the method of private ownership and private feeding for some draught animals: the cooperative sells a part of the draught animals that are not needed for the time being to several members to raise and use together; or sells young and undeveloped livestock to one or several members for private raising and feeding. There are three benefits to this method: First, it can solve the contradiction between the collective use of the cooperative and the needs of the members' families for livestock, and it is very convenient for several members to buy a small donkey to grind flour and carry coal. Second, it can relieve the burden of agricultural cooperatives in raising small livestock. Third, it can encourage the members' enthusiasm for raising livestock.

    耕畜分散饲养　喂得又肥又壮
    全国各地许多农业社实行了分散喂养耕牛的办法
    本报讯　全国各地许多农业生产合作社实行分散喂养耕牛的办法，已经取得显著成绩；同集中喂养的办法比较起来，已经可以肯定这样做对保护和发展耕牛更加有利。湖北、湖南、广东、福建、江苏、四川等分散喂养耕牛比较普遍的省份，不论山区和平原区、灾区和非灾区、重灾区和轻灾区，耕牛一般的都比较健壮，幼小牲畜也有一定数量的增加。湖北省1955年有各种牲畜二百七十一万八千三百多头，合作化的头一年就增加到二百九十一万八千七百多头，纯增殖率达7％。湖南省1955年全省有各种牲畜二百七十四万六千九百多头，去年虽然受了灾，也增加到二百八十五万四千六百多头，纯增殖率达3％。目前，在许多地区，群众已经认识到分散喂养耕牛的好处。部分集中喂养耕畜没有养好，并且在短时期又确实没有把握扭转耕牛瘦弱情况的农业社，已经或正在实行分散喂养。有些社采取分散喂养的办法以后很快就收到明显的效果。如河南省长葛县连丰二社田庄村生产队，共有耕畜五十一头，原来耕畜集中喂养的时候，瘦弱情况相当严重。当时，一等膘和二等膘的各四头，三等膘四十三头。实行分散喂养不到五十天，一等膘就上升为九头，二等膘上升为二十头，三等膘下降为二十一头，死亡一头。河南省遂平县耕畜集中喂养的时候，去年12月份平均每天非正常死亡七头，全月死亡头数占总头数的1.59％；今年改为分散喂养以后，3月份死亡二十头，占总头数的0.15％。
  耕畜分散喂养好处多
    分散喂养所以能够迅速扭转耕牛的瘦弱和死亡情况，是因为：在农业社初办的时候，分散喂养确实比集中喂养有更多的方便条件。归纳起来，分散喂养的好处有以下一些：
    第一，能够把社的集体利益和社员的个人利益密切结合起来，提高社员爱畜、保畜、增畜的积极性。如河南省长葛县连丰二社，耕畜集中喂养的时候，有不少骨瘦如柴；分散喂养以后，耕畜的瘦弱情况就有了好转。社员曹贵荣分喂的三头快要死的牲畜，经过他的精心照料，不到五十天的时间，都恢复了健康。
    第二，能够削减社内兴建大型畜舍的现金开支，可以发挥社员原有的畜舍、用具的作用。这样做，既照顾了群众喂养耕牛的历史习惯，又符合目前农业社的领导水平和饲养员的技术水平，对社、对社员都有利。
    第三，耕牛不互相拥挤，不乱顶乱咬；饲养人员容易照料，草料能喂的匀，饮水能喝的足；疾病不易发生，即便发生也容易发现，及时进行封锁、隔离、治疗，不致蔓延成灾。据河南省舞阳县调查，这个县集中喂养耕畜的二十四个乡，共有牲畜三万二千多头，由于饲养不好，入春以来就死掉五千五百三十三头，占总头数的17.3％；分散喂养的二十九个农业社，共有牲畜三万一千多头，由于饲养周到，入春以来仅死了一百三十头，占总头数的0.42％。
    第四，家舍相连，便于饲养员对耕牛的照料。不论白天、黑夜，刮风、下雨，饲养员都可以按时给耕牛添草添料。社员家里关心耕牛的人多了，耕牛也能沾上社员家里的一些光，菜汤、刷锅水都能充作饲料。家、舍连在一起，有利于冬季耕牛保暖抗寒，增强抵抗力；能使饲养员全面地了解耕牛的性格特点，随时掌握耕牛的劳动、吃食、休息、反刍、有无疾病等情况，避免乱拉乱用，使役过度等偏向。如河南省遂平县沈寨乡光明一社社员李绍中，对他分喂的一头十分瘦弱的毛驴，生火取暖，揉草喂食，温汤饮水，二十多天的时间，这头毛驴就恢复了健康。
    第五，分散喂养不仅壮劳力可以负责照料，许多妇女、儿童都可帮助进行喂养放牧。
    第六，垫圈除圈比较省力，不仅耕牛的环境卫生好，按时交配繁殖小牛都方便，还可以多积肥料。
  分散喂养的具体办法
    分散喂养的具体办法，主要的是耕畜公有，分户喂养。通常有三种情况：第一，是把社或队的所有牲畜，根据公母、大小、做活快慢，分别搭配成犋，按犋分喂到户。有的是原畜归原主，原畜用原圈。有的是分散到几户。第二，是把老、残、病、弱、幼小牲畜分散到户喂养。第三，是把社员家庭生活需要的牲畜，分给社员喂养。分户喂养的形式基本上有两种。一种叫做“大包干”。像福建省南安县莲塘社，把耕牛固定专人喂养，饲料由饲养员购买，耕牛养胖增殖由饲养员全部得益，喂养不力体重下降的损失由饲养员负责，农业社按耕牛劳动的数量和质量给予一定租价。这样做的好处是能促进饲养员爱护耕牛的自觉性。另一种叫做“包工包养、超产奖励”。包工包养的内容一般是定（包）草料、定（包）工分、定（包）畜膘、定（包）繁殖。农业社定出每头耕牛的包工包养定额，包给饲养员喂养。喂养的好，超过定额，给以奖励；喂养的不好，低于定额，视情况赔偿。耕牛因病所需要的医药费由社或队负责。
    也有些社采取了部分耕畜私有私养的办法：社里把暂时用不着的一部分耕畜卖给几户社员伙养伙用；或把幼小未育成的牲畜卖给一户或几户社员私养私喂。这办法有三种好处：第一、可以解决社内集体使用与社员家庭需用牲畜的矛盾，几户社员买一头小毛驴拉磨、驮煤非常方便。第二、可以卸掉农业社喂养小牲畜的包袱。第三、可以鼓励社员喂养牲畜的积极性。
