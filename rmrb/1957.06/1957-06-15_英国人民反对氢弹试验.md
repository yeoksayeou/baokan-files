　　British People Oppose Hydrogen Bomb Tests
  　By Alan Winnington, "Daily Worker" correspondent in Britain
    For six weeks, women dressed in black have been continuously petitioning the British House of Commons. In Britain, black is the color of death and mourning. These women quietly go to the Parliament, fill out the slips usually used to request a meeting with a Member of Parliament, and then stand in the Central Lobby waiting. They are always there.
    Though they are just standing there in black clothes, each woman represents millions of other similar women. They stand there showing the conscience of the people, demanding that the Members of Parliament who represent them acknowledge it. Their quiet and determined petition is to demand that the British government stop hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific.
    Every day, these women come from all over Britain. The petition movement began after some women in Watford, near London, announced that they would conduct a continuous "mourning petition" to the House of Commons until the hydrogen bomb tests stopped.
    The authorities are simply powerless to stop this movement. Going to the House of Commons to meet with Members of Parliament is the constitutional right of every voter. The police are helpless in the face of this activity.
    This is one of the many forms of struggle adopted by the British people to oppose the hydrogen bomb and the hydrogen bomb tests that the government has refused to stop.
    When Britain Exploded Its First Hydrogen Bomb
    Amidst a chorus of opposition, Britain's first hydrogen bomb was exploded in May. Protests from all sides formed a tidal wave of anger. Electrical workers immediately launched a symbolic strike. Trade unions and the Labour Party, the Communist Party, and other parties also organized protest actions in various places. As protest actions increased day by day, national trade union organizations such as boiler workers, chemical industry workers, and scientists rose up to demand a halt to hydrogen bomb tests. Subsequently, bishops, churches, and non-political groups also joined in.
    It is not difficult to understand why the British people are reacting so strongly on this issue. It is not only because Britain is a small island nation that cannot withstand the impact of a hydrogen bomb. What ignited the fire of anger in the British people is that they see their own government obstructing the achievement of an international agreement to stop testing nuclear weapons.
    Three countries (the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union) have already mastered the hydrogen bomb. However, the longer the issue of banning such weapons is delayed, the more countries will possess these weapons, making it more difficult to ban them.
    Britain is the most vulnerable of the three countries. It should find a way to avoid the threat of the hydrogen bomb. The Soviet Union has suggested an immediate cessation of all experimental explosions, and if Britain and the Soviet Union jointly made this request, then the United States would be forced to follow suit under pressure from domestic and international public opinion. Macmillan refused to stop the tests, even saying that he would not consider anything other than so-called "controlled" tests. This infuriated the British people.
    Denial that the Balance of Power Has Changed
    The hydrogen bomb mania of the British government leaders seems to stem from their failure to recognize the fact that the world's balance of power has changed. This folly led Eden to launch the Suez War, in which the United States turned its back on its "ally." Nevertheless, the Conservatives are now frantically pursuing some kind of Anglo-American atomic alliance and preparing for a nuclear war.
    The British people clearly see the mistakes and dangers of this policy—mainly that Britain will be the first to be destroyed in a nuclear war. The Macmillan government has put itself in a state of confusion with contradictions and absurdities because it is trying its best to deceive people into not thinking that way.
    Macmillan's main argument is that possessing and testing hydrogen bombs can serve as a "deterrent force" to prevent war. But British workers do not believe this. They worry that the aggressive Dulles will provoke a war and drag Britain into it. They are also uneasy about the aggressiveness of the British Conservatives, who recently attacked Egypt. They remember that Dulles, on the pretext that the progressive parliament of Jordan was a "communist invasion," dispatched the US fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean.
    Now the claim of "communist threat" is becoming increasingly ineffective. The Soviet Union mastered the hydrogen bomb many years before Britain. If the Soviet Union had aggressive ambitions, it would not have waited for Britain to develop such weapons like the United States.
    Preparing for a Nuclear War
    Amidst the government's rhetoric, the people have sensed that preparations for a nuclear war are underway. Because Macmillan said that Britain is reducing its expensive conventional military equipment in order to rely on nuclear weapons and American long-range missiles (which have not yet been manufactured and are even more expensive).
    To deceive the people, Macmillan talks a lot about the difference between "tactical" and "strategic" atomic weapons. This is nonsense. Because the use of a "tactical" weapon will result in the same number of deaths as the weapons that caused so many deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But Macmillan is saying that these weapons are "small," "harmless," and "safe." They are trying to treat atomic bombs as "conventional" weapons. This means that in the future, even in a local war, these weapons will be used. Once any form of nuclear weapon can be used, it is certain that hydrogen bombs will also be used.
    The monopolized newspapers are also trying to portray the three countries that have mastered hydrogen bombs as being equally wrong, and are pretending not to know that the Soviet Union has proposed an immediate cessation of testing as the first step towards banning and destroying all nuclear weapons.
    Despite the British government's best efforts to confuse public opinion, the British people refuse to be fooled. Every day, more people are joining the struggle to take hydrogen bombs away from the Conservative government. New forms of struggle are emerging every day.
    Various Anti-Hydrogen Bomb Activities
    After the first British hydrogen bomb exploded, someone in a district of London scattered many leaflets in the sky, saying: "This may be radioactive dust." In another district, the Labour Party-controlled district council refused to implement the government's ridiculous order—to establish organizations to "defend" against hydrogen bombs. So the government forcibly took over. As a result, the district chief locked his hands on the iron gate. As the police broke the handcuffs, the district chief said: "The only solution is to ban nuclear weapons and establish friendly relations between countries." The district chief's words won cheers from the crowd present. (See picture below)
    These various anti-hydrogen bomb test activities show that the British people have seen that stopping the tests is the first necessary step towards a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons. They have seen through all the lies.
    The British people see that imperialists whose power is relatively declining will attempt to solve local problems, prevent colonial people from fighting for freedom, and threaten socialist countries by threatening nuclear attacks.
    It is precisely because of this understanding, regardless of the depth of understanding, that the British people have united and plunged into a great mass movement against the government's hydrogen bomb tests.
    The Passivity of Labour Party Leaders
    As usual, Labour Party leaders are being forced to support this mass movement. Gaitskell had initially intended not to let the Labour Party come out against the hydrogen bomb tests, but under pressure from most Labour MPs and the masses of party members, he had to declare his opposition. But so far, Labour leaders have not issued any national call to organize protests. As usual, they limit their actions to parliamentary debates and do not use the power of the mass movement to bring down the government.
    However, the British Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" have decided to host a mass demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square on July 14, and in the process of preparing for this demonstration, to unite all the scattered forces to form a unified movement. British Communist Party General Secretary Gollan has called on the people to launch a movement larger in scale than the protest against the Suez adventure. In his call, he asked: "How much longer can we tolerate Macmillan despising the protests of almost all the British people?"
    The movement is now rising day by day. Those women in black clothes are part of the vanguard of this movement. Fifty years ago, some women chained themselves to the railings outside the Prime Minister's residence, fighting with the police for women's suffrage. This time they are fighting for the right to survive, so that there will be no more threat of nuclear war, not only in Britain but also throughout the world. (Translated by Yuan)

### 英国人民反对氢弹试验

　　英国人民反对氢弹试验
  　英国“工人日报”记者  阿兰·魏宁顿
    六个星期以来，每天都有穿着黑色衣服的妇女不断地到英国下议院去请愿。在英国，黑色是表示死亡和哀悼的颜色。这些妇女静静地到国会去，填写了通常会见某位议员的条子，然后站在中央大厅等候着。她们总是在那里。
    她们虽只是穿着黑色衣服站在那里，可是一位妇女就代表着几百万其他同样的妇女。她们站在那里显示着人民的良心，要求代表她们的国会议员们予以承认。她们静静的和坚定的请愿行动是要求英国政府停止在太平洋试验氢弹。
    每天，这些妇女从英国各地跑来。自从有一天伦敦附近华特福地方的一些妇女宣布她们要到下议院进行不断的“哀悼式请愿”一直到氢弹试验停止之后，这种请愿运动就开始了。
    当局简直无力阻止这个运动。到下议院去会见议员是每一个选民的宪法权利。警察对她们这个活动束手无策。
    这是英国人民反对氢弹及反对政府一直不肯停止的氢弹试验所采取的许多斗争形式中的一种。
    当英国爆炸了第一个氢弹以后
    在一片反对声中，英国的第一个氢弹在5月间爆炸了。各方的抗议就形成了怒潮。电气工人立刻发动了一次象征性的罢工。各工会和工党，共产党和其它党派也在各地组织抗议行动。在抗议行动与日俱增的时候，像锅炉工人，化学工业工人和科学家们的全国性工会组织都起来要求停止氢弹试验。接着，主教、教会和非政治性团体也参加了。
    要明白为什么英国人民在这个问题上反应如此强烈并不困难。这不仅由于英国是个小岛国，经不起氢弹的打击。使英国人民燃起愤怒之火的是他们看到自己的政府竟会阻挠达成一项停止试验核武器的国际协议。
    已有三个国家（美、英、苏）掌握了氢弹。可是在禁绝这类武器的问题上愈拖延，那就会使更多的国家拥有这种武器，从而要禁绝它们就更困难了。
    英国是三个国家中最容易遭受攻击的一个。它应该想办法避免氢弹的威胁。苏联已经建议立即停止一切试验性的爆炸，假如英国和苏联一道提出这个要求，那么美国就要在国内外舆论压力下不得不跟着走。麦克米伦拒绝停止试验，甚至于说除了所谓“管制”试验之外不考虑其它问题。这就使英国人民冒火了。
    否认力量对比已改变
    英国政府领导人的氢弹颠狂症似乎是由于他们不承认世界力量对比已经改变这个事实。这种愚蠢曾使艾登发动了苏伊士战争，在这个冒险中美国又背弃了它的“盟国”。虽然如此，保守党人现在还发疯似地追求一个什么英美原子联盟并且准备一场核武器战争。
    英国人民对于这个政策的错误与危险性看得很清楚，——主要是英国在一场核武器战争中将首先被毁灭。麦克米伦政府由于要竭力骗人不要这样想而使自身陷于矛盾与荒谬的混乱境地。
    麦克米伦的主要论点是：执有和试验氢弹可以作为一种“阻遏力量”来防止战争。可是英国工人不相信这一套。他们担心侵略成性的杜勒斯会挑起一场战争，并且把英国拖下水。他们也对最近曾攻打埃及的英国保守党的侵略性不放心。他们记得杜勒斯曾借口约旦的进步议会是“共产主义侵略”而派遣美国舰队驶向东地中海。
    现在“共产主义威胁”的说法已经愈来愈失效了。苏联早在英国以前许多年就掌握了氢弹。假如苏联是有侵略野心的话，它就不会等待英国像美国一样发展起这种武器来。
    准备进行一场核武器战争
    在政府的花言巧语中，人民已感觉到为一场核武器战争的准备工作正在进行中。因为麦克米伦说英国缩减花钱很多的常规军备为的是要依靠核武器和美国的长距离导弹（这种导弹目前还没有制造出来，并且更费钱）。
    为了哄骗人民，麦克米伦大谈什么“战术”和“战略”原子武器的区别。这是瞎扯淡。因为一个“战术”武器使用起来结果会同曾在广岛和长崎造成许多人死亡的武器一样。可是麦克米伦却在说这种武器是“小型的”、“无害的”和“安全的”。他们企图把原子弹当作“常规”武器。这就是说将来即或在一场局部的战争中，这种武器就会被使用。一旦任何形式的核武器能被使用，可以肯定地说，氢弹也一定会被使用。
    被垄断的报纸也在企图将三个掌握有氢弹的国家说成是同样错误的，并假装不知道苏联曾建议立刻停止试验以作为禁止和销毁所有核武器的第一个步骤。
    尽管英国政府不遗余力地蒙混舆论，但英国人民是拒绝上当的。每天都有更多的人参加从保守党政府手中夺走氢弹的斗争。每天都出现新方式的斗争。
    多种多样的反氢弹活动
    当第一个英国氢弹爆炸之后，伦敦有一个区就有人在天空撒了许多纸条，纸条上写道：“这可能就是带放射性的灰尘”。在另外一个区，工党控制的区议会拒绝执行政府的可笑的命令——建立“防御”氢弹的组织。于是政府就强制接管。结果发现区长将自己双手锁在铁门上。警察在弄断手铐的时候，区长说：“唯一的解决办法是禁止核武器，并建立国与国之间的友好关系”。区长这句话博得在场群众的欢呼。（见下图）
    这些多种多样的反氢弹试验的活动说明英国人民已经看到停止试验是走向全面禁止核武器的第一个必要步骤。他们已看穿了一切谎言。
    英国人民看到力量正在相对地下降的帝国主义者将借核武器攻击的威胁来企图解决局部问题，来防止殖民地人民争取自由，并威胁社会主义国家。
    正是由于有了这种认识，不管认识程度的深浅，英国人民才团结起来投入一个伟大的反对政府试验氢弹的群众运动。
    工党领袖们的被动
    像往常一样，工党领袖们是被迫来支持这个群众运动的。盖次克尔最初曾打算不让工党出面反对氢弹试验，可是在大多数工党议员和广大党员群众的压力下，他才不得不声明反对。可是到现在为止工党领袖还没有发布任何全国性的号召来组织抗议活动。他们像往常一样只将他们的行动局限于议会的辩论，而不利用群众运动的力量把政府拖下台。
    可是，英国共产党和“工人日报”已决定在7月14日主持一次伦敦特拉法加广场的群众示威，并且在准备这次示威的过程中要团结一切分散的力量来组成一个统一的运动。英共总书记高兰已号召人民发动一次规模比抗议苏伊士冒险时更大的运动。他在号召书中问道：“麦克米伦鄙视几乎是全体英国人民的抗议，对此我们还能容忍多久？”
    运动现在正逐日高涨。那些穿黑衣服的妇女就是这个运动的一部分前锋。五十年前有些妇女曾将自己绑在首相官邸外面的铁栏杆上，为了争取妇女选举权而与警察斗争。这次她们是为了生存的权利而战斗，不仅在英国而且也在全世界再也没有核子战争威胁。　（元译）
