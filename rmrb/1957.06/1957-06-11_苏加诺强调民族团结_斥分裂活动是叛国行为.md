Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 10th: According to Antara News Agency, President Sukarno stated at a mass rally held in Serang, West Java, on the 9th that the struggle to recover West Irian has not yet been successful because of domestic turmoil and separatist activities.

President Sukarno condemned the activities of racialist and separatist groups as treasonous. He repeatedly explained the importance of national unity and elaborated on the Five Principles of the Nation and the five tasks of the Juanda Cabinet.

Later that day, President Sukarno said at a meeting of local officials in Serang that the notion that he wanted Indonesia to copy the Soviet and Chinese government systems was unrealistic. He said, "We only want to take good things as examples." President Sukarno said that he had asked the Indonesian people to take the activities of the Chinese people in construction as their own example.

President Sukarno emphasized that the governmental systems of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China are respectively adapted to the character of the people of these countries, and Indonesia should also have a governmental system that is suitable for the character of its own people.

　　苏加诺强调民族团结
    斥分裂活动是叛国行为
    新华社雅加达10日电  据安塔拉通讯社报道，苏加诺总统9日在西爪哇西冷举行的群众大会上说，收复西伊里安的斗争还没有取得成就，因为国内存在着动乱和分裂活动。
    苏加诺总统谴责种族主义者和分裂主义者集团的活动是叛国的。他反复说明民族团结的重要性，并且解释了建国五基和朱安达内阁的五项任务。
    当天迟些时候，苏加诺总统在西冷地方官员的会议上说，认为他要印度尼西亚抄袭苏联和中国的政府制度的说法，是不符合实际的。他说，我们只是要拿好的东西来做榜样。苏加诺总统说，他曾经让印度尼西亚人民把中国人民在建设中的活动作为自己的榜样。
    苏加诺总统强调指出，美国、苏联和中国的政府制度是分别同这些国家的人民的性格相适应的，印度尼西亚也应当有适合于自己的人民性格的政府制度。
