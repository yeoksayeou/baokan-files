Universities in the Capital Indignantly Denounce
    Bombs Cannot Intimidate Us!
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that on the afternoon of the 17th, the Student Union of Beijing Medical College, responding to the requests of students, held a mass meeting of more than a thousand people. Everyone unanimously expressed extreme anger and protest against the sabotage activities of reactionary elements who plotted to harm the Party Committee Secretary. In their speeches, everyone pointed out: We must fight against reactionary elements and raise our vigilance. Ma Mouxian, the representative of the Marxist-Leninist Basics, Philosophy, and Chinese Revolution History Teaching and Research Group, pointed out in his speech: This incident shows that we are still facing class struggle. Recently, some people have been clamoring for our Party to step down and to kill Communists, and now counter-revolutionary elements have taken action. We must raise our vigilance. Dai Meimei, the student representative of the Department of Hygiene, said that we must stand firm and stand at the forefront of defending socialism, and resolutely repel any attacks against socialism.
    At this mass meeting, a letter to all university students in Beijing was also adopted. They called on the students: For the sake of the socialist cause, let us unite closely around the Party, fight to smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of the right-wing elements, and fight to defeat the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionary elements! Bombs cannot intimidate us!
    Students from many schools, including Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Beijing Petroleum Institute, have also held meetings and posted wall posters to condemn the incident of reactionary elements throwing explosives at the residence of the Party Committee Secretary of Beijing Medical College.
