Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its preliminary meetings in groups today. The representative groups focused on discussing the two reports prepared by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Bo Yibo to be submitted to the Congress for discussion: the draft state budget and final accounts, and the draft annual plan for the national economy. During the discussions, the representatives affirmed the significant achievements made in the government's work, while also raising questions and suggestions for revisions and supplements to the two reports. They also broadly criticized shortcomings and errors in the work.

　　The Budget Execution is Good, the Achievements are Enormous

The representatives believed that the overall execution of the 1956 budget was good, and the achievements were enormous. They said that our country is so large that it is not easy to manage, and it is impossible to have no shortcomings. Representatives from Guizhou and other provinces pointed out that 1956 was a year of relatively severe natural disasters, but it was also a year of unprecedented development in socialist construction and socialist transformation. Factories and products that had never existed in history (such as automobiles and jet aircraft) appeared, the vast number of disaster victims received government relief, and prices were stable, which was unimaginable in the old society. Regarding the 1957 budget, many representatives believed that it was in line with the actual situation and took into account the needs of all parties. They said that if this budget can be implemented well, it will guarantee the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan.

Di Chaobai, a representative from Hunan Province, said in his speech that last year was a crucial year for the victory of China's socialist revolution. In the great changes in production relations, productivity was not only not damaged, but industrial production also had a very great development, with the total value of industrial output increasing by 31%, which is a growth rate unmatched by any country. Although agriculture suffered severe natural disasters, it still grew by 4.9% compared to 1955. These all prove the superiority of the peaceful transformation methods adopted by China's socialist revolution.

Li Zheren said that there are three fundamental principles for reviewing financial budgets and final accounts: First, based on the National Constitution, check whether the financial line has implemented the spirit of serving the overall line of the country. Second, based on the draft budget approved by the People's Congress meeting last year. Third, based on the specific circumstances in the execution of the annual budget. He said that based on these three standards, he believes that the execution of the 1956 state budget was reasonable and the achievements were very great. In terms of financial revenue and expenditure, it adapted to the high tide of enthusiasm and requirements of the people across the country in building socialism. It guaranteed the completion and over-completion of many construction projects; last year's financial expenditure also guaranteed that people in some areas successfully overcame the severe three disasters of flood, drought, and wind; and it also guaranteed the basic stability of market prices.

At the Jiangsu representative group meeting, Xue Muqiao said that the budget income and expenditure, credit income and expenditure, and supply and demand of materials must be balanced and integrated with each other. In economic terms, there must be two balances: the balance between national construction investment and the production of means of production, and the balance between the production of consumer goods and the improvement of people's lives. China is a large country with a large population, and not only must the supply and demand of materials be balanced, but there should also be more material reserves. It is very difficult to increase reserves of consumer goods and requires five to ten years of accumulation. This year, attention should be paid to the balance of the production of various means of production, especially the balance of the production of building materials such as steel, cement, and wood.

　　Emphasize Implementing the Policy of Building the Country Through Hard Work and Thrift, Strictly Criticize Various Wasteful Situations

During the discussions, many representatives emphasized the need to resolutely implement the policy of building the country through hard work and thrift. They said that we are people's representatives and should think more about the interests of the country and all the people. They made strict criticisms of wasteful situations in construction and social life. Some representatives believed that an important reason for the waste phenomenon is that the idea of building the country through hard work and thrift has not been firmly established in all government workers and all the people.

Wang Zhen, a representative of the military representative group, emphasized that the conservation movement must be implemented for a long time. He criticized some agencies for building houses that are too beautiful, and some county agencies for building buildings and auditoriums, and installing heating. He said that this trend must be changed, and a simple and frugal style must be cultivated in the future, and everyone must pay attention to conservation. Many representatives from Shandong Province criticized the idea that everything is "taken care of" by the state, believing that this idea has caused a lot of waste and increased contradictions in social life. Yang Kebing, a representative from Shandong Province and secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, criticized the idea of "taking care of everything" in the construction of urban housing. She said that even if a large number of houses are built in the city, the housing shortage is still serious. The reason is that the rent for public housing is too low, and a large number of family members of employees are flowing into the city. This not only makes the housing shortage develop malignantly, but also makes a large number of employable family members of employees disengaged from production. Yang Kebing believes that if this phenomenon is not resolutely corrected, there will never be enough houses, which will inevitably greatly increase the state's non-productive investment and be detrimental to construction.

The representatives believed that the waste in public medical care reflects that the new moral concept of some people putting the interests of the country first is still very weak, and everyone made sharp criticisms of this situation. At the Guangdong and Tianjin representative group meetings, the representatives criticized some people who enjoy public medical care for often going to the hospital to pass the time even though they are not sick, resulting in the outpatient department of the hospital being often overcrowded, and some people who are really sick cannot see a doctor. Others take the medicine back after seeing a doctor but do not take it, some force doctors to give expensive medicines, and force doctors to issue sick leave certificates. Xu Zuoxia, a representative from Shandong Province and president of Qingdao Medical College, said that in some places, public medical care is very chaotic. Even single eyelids are changed to double eyelids with public medical care, and some people "take the hospital as their home" and do not leave the hospital when they should. This practice of "taking care of everything" not only causes serious waste to the country, but also causes many contradictions such as busy medical units, insufficient drug supply, and increased employee absenteeism. Wang Shuzhen, a representative from Shanghai and an expert in obstetrics and gynecology, suggested that people who enjoy these benefits should also pay a portion of their medical expenses so that they can understand how much money the state has spent on them.

　　Various Criticisms and Suggestions Were Made on Industrial Production and Capital Construction

During the discussion in the representative groups of Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, etc., the representatives made criticisms and suggestions on some major issues in industrial production and capital construction. Some representatives from Shaanxi Province pointed out that the urban planning of Xi'an City has a great blindness and a lot of waste. Many agencies and enterprises have excessive, excessively good, and premature non-productive construction. Some new enterprises are too far apart, which not only occupies too much land, but also increases construction investment. Yu Zhenying, a representative from Shaanxi Province and a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, suggested that in future construction, enterprises should be built first, then agencies, machines should be installed first, and then employee welfare should be taken care of. He said that employee welfare must be built on the basis of production development. Representatives from Tianjin criticized the shortcomings of slow planning and too rigid control in current capital construction and production. They believed that the slow release of plans has caused difficulties in the supply of raw materials and the deployment of labor. Representative Tan Zhen criticized the chaotic situation in planning, saying that enterprises need to submit plans for the raw materials they need in the third quarter of the previous year, but the production tasks cannot be determined for a long time, so enterprises have to make a mess of orders. When the tasks come down, they have to be changed again.

Some representatives of the Shanghai and Beijing representative groups criticized the waste in industrial production and construction. Some representatives pointed out that some commodities are overstocked in commercial departments, but the product plans of industrial departments have not yet been reduced. Some representatives said that some enterprises have already been built, and it was only discovered that the varieties do not meet the needs, but it is very difficult to change the product models, resulting in a lot of waste. Some representatives also pointed out that some responsible cadres in the localities like to engage in large-scale and high-standard construction. They hope that the responsible cadres of the central government will go to the localities for specific inspections to correct this wasteful phenomenon. At the Beijing representative group meeting, many representatives raised opinions on the problems of incomplete urban construction plans, excessive non-productive personnel in factories, and unreasonable factory bonuses.

During the discussion in the representative groups of Jiangxi, Hebei, etc., many representatives criticized the situation of too many non-direct production personnel in some factories and mining enterprises. Zan Ling, a representative from Hebei Province and an engineer from the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry, said that some factories have doubled their production costs due to the excessive number of non-production personnel. Wu Youxun, a representative from Jiangxi Province, criticized the shortcomings of some enterprises and agencies blindly recruiting personnel. He believed that the increase in production personnel and non-production personnel should have a certain ratio, and relevant departments should control it.

　　Do Not Blindly Reform Cultivation Techniques, Water Conservancy Must Pay Attention to Thrift

At several group meetings, many representatives made comments on the government's agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy work. Shao Shiping and Liu Junxiu, representatives from Jiangxi, believed that agriculture should not only focus on key points but also pay attention to comprehensive development, and the allocation of investment in agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy is unreasonable with the central government having more and the local government having less. Wang Baozhen, a representative from Hebei Province and vice chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, suggested that the state increase investment in water conservancy to prevent and reduce the harm of floods to agricultural production. Li Hui, a representative from Shanxi Province and deputy commissioner of the Jinnan Prefecture, said that to increase grain production, cultivation techniques must be reformed; to reform cultivation techniques, in-depth investigation and research must be carried out to find out the conditions that can be reformed, and do not blindly reform subjectively. She used the example of the reduction in wheat production in the Jinnan area this year to illustrate the harm of blindly reforming cultivation techniques. She suggested that the central government should carefully study the issue of reforming cultivation techniques.

He Kinong, a representative from Shandong Province and deputy minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that spending more money does not necessarily get things done well, and spending less money does not necessarily mean things cannot be done well. He criticized the Ministry of Water Conservancy for lacking the spirit of thrift in its work. He said that the water conservancy projects built by the Ministry of Water Conservancy last year cost an average of 20 to 30 yuan to irrigate one mu of land. However, the water conservancy projects built by the masses cost very little. The Guanchu Irrigation Project in Sichuan Province, which was built by local leading organs and the masses, only invested an average of more than 2 yuan per mu of land.

　　Labor and Production Education for Students Should be Strengthened, and Cultural and Educational Funds in Remote Areas Should be Appropriately Taken Care Of

At the representative group discussions in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, many representatives raised opinions on issues such as students' labor education and the unbalanced development of cultural and educational undertakings in remote areas. They believed that at present, most college graduates despise labor, and the state mostly assigns them to work in leading organs and research organs, and only a few are sent to grassroots units. This situation needs to be changed. Some representatives from the Guangxi group believed in their speeches that labor and production education for students must be strengthened in the future, and secondary schools should be located in rural areas as much as possible, which saves costs and avoids students not wanting to return to rural areas after graduation due to the influence of urban material life. Pan Gu, the first secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that this year, 60% of the 3,000 middle school students enrolled in Nanning's middle schools came from rural areas. If other problems are resolved well, it is entirely possible to move middle schools to rural areas. Representatives from Guizhou proposed that the expenditure of cultural and educational funds should appropriately take care of remote areas. Guizhou is a disaster-prone area, and its cultural and educational undertakings are underdeveloped, and the gap between it and some big cities and other provinces is too large.

Some representative groups from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Tibet, Qamdo, and Fujian spent some time conducting discussions, while others continued to read documents. Representatives from Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces concentrated on criticizing the erroneous remarks of bourgeois rightists today. In the Jiangxi representative group, representatives have been refuting the fallacies of bourgeois rightists who oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party in the discussions in recent days. They expressed their determination to draw a clear ideological line from Luo Longji, a representative elected from this province.

　　人民代表分组讨论政府工作
    肯定巨大成绩　严格批评错误
    据新华社24日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天继续分组举行预备会议。各代表小组着重座谈了李先念副总理和薄一波副总理准备提交大会讨论的国家预算决算（草案）和国民经济年度计划（草案）的两个报告。代表们在座谈中肯定了政府工作所取得的重大成绩，同时对两个报告中的问题提出了询问和修改补充的意见，对工作中的缺点和错误广泛地提出了批评。
　　预算执行情况是好的，成绩是巨大的
    代表们认为，1956年预算执行情况总的说是好的，成绩是巨大的。他们说，我们国家太大，当这个家不容易，一点缺点没有是不可能的。贵州等省的代表并指出，1956年是自然灾害比较严重的一年，但是这一年却是社会主义建设和社会主义改造空前发展的一年，历史上没有的工厂和产品（如汽车、喷气式飞机等）出现了，广大灾民得到了政府的救济，物价是稳定的，这在旧社会是不可想像的。对于1957年的预算，许多代表认为是符合实际情况的，照顾了各方面的需要。他们说，如果能够很好地执行这个预算，对第一个五年计划的提前完成是有保证的。
    湖南省代表狄超白在发言中认为，去年是我国社会主义革命胜利的关键性的一年。在生产关系的大变动中，生产力不但没有受到破坏，而且工业生产有了极大的发展，工业总产值增加了31％，这是任何国家没有的增长速度；农业虽受到严重的自然灾害，仍然比1955年增长了4.9％。这些都证明了我国社会主义革命所采取的和平改造方法的优越性。
    李哲人说，审查财政预决算的根本原则有三条：一，根据国家宪法，检查财政路线是否贯彻了为国家总路线服务的精神。第二，根据去年人民代表大会会议通过的预算草案。三，根据执行年度预算中的具体情况。他说，根据这三个标准，我认为1956年国家预算执行的情况是合理的，成绩是很大的。在财政收支上适应了全国人民建设社会主义的高涨热情和要求。保证了许多建设项目的完成和超额完成；去年的财政支出还保证部分地区的人民胜利地渡过了严重的水、旱、风三灾；也保证了市场物价的基本稳定。
    在江苏代表小组会上，薛暮桥说，预算收支、信贷收支、物资供求三者必须平衡，并互相结合。在经济方面必须有两个平衡：国家建设投资和生产资料生产的平衡，消费资料生产和人民生活提高的平衡。我国是人口众多的大国，不但物资供求要平衡，而且物资储备应该多些。消费物资要增加储备是很不容易的，须要有五年到十年的积累。在今年，应该注意到各种生产资料生产的平衡，特别是钢材、水泥和木材等建筑材料生产的平衡。
    强调贯彻勤俭建国方针  严格批评各种浪费情况
    在座谈中，很多代表强调要坚决贯彻勤俭建国的方针。他们说，我们是人民代表，应该多为国家、为全体人民的利益着想。他们对建设事业和社会生活中的浪费情况提出了严格的批评。有的代表认为，造成浪费现象的很重要原因是没有在所有政府工作人员以及全体人民中树立起牢固的勤俭建国的思想。
    军队代表小组的代表王震强调节约运动必须长期贯彻，他批评有些机关盖的房子太漂亮，有些县的机关也盖楼房，建礼堂，并安装暖气。他说，这种风气一定要改变，今后一定要养成一种勤俭朴素的风气，要人人注意节约。山东省许多代表批评了一切都由国家“包下来”的思想，认为在这种思想支配下，造成很多浪费，并使社会生活增加了矛盾。山东省代表、中共鞍山市委书记杨克冰就城市房屋的建设问题批评“包下来”的思想，她说，即使城市大量地建设了住宅，可是房荒仍然严重，其原因就是公家房租太低，以及职工家属大量流入城市。这样不仅使房荒恶性地发展，而且使大量的有劳动能力的职工家属脱离了生产。杨克冰认为，这种现象如果不坚决纠正，房子永远不够，这就势必大大增加国家非生产的投资，不利于建设事业。
    代表们认为公费医疗中的浪费情况反映了有些人以国家利益为重的新的道德观念还非常薄弱，大家对这方面的情况提出了尖锐的批评。在广东、天津代表小组会上，代表们批评有些享受公费医疗待遇的人虽然没有病，却经常到医院去消磨时间，结果使医院门诊部经常拥挤不堪，一些真正有病的人却看不上病；另有一些人看了病把药拿回去不吃，有的强迫医生给贵重药品，强迫医生开休假证明书。山东省代表、青岛医学院院长徐佐夏说，有的地方公费医疗出现非常混乱的情况，甚至单眼皮改成双眼皮也公费医疗，有的“以院为家”，该出院也不出院，这种什么都“包下来”的做法，不仅给国家造成严重浪费，而且造成医疗单位忙乱、药品供应不足、职工缺勤率增加等许多矛盾。上海市代表、妇产科专家王淑贞建议，享受这些待遇的人自己也应付出一部分医疗费用，使他们了解一下国家究竟为他们花了多少钱。
　　对工业生产和基本建设提出了各种批评和建议
    陕西、河北、上海、北京、天津等代表小组在讨论中，代表们对工业生产和基本建设中的一些重大问题提出了批评和建议。陕西省有的代表指出，西安市城市规划有很大的盲目性，浪费很大，许多机关、企业非生产性建设过多、过好、过早，有些新建企业相距过远，不但过多地占用了土地，而且也增加了建设投资。陕西省代表、民革中央常委于振瀛建议在今后建设中要先建设企业，后建设机关，先装机器，后搞职工福利。他说，职工福利事业必须建立在生产发展的基础上。天津市的代表在发言中批评了目前基本建设和生产工作中计划下达迟缓、控制太死等缺点。他们认为，计划下达迟缓造成了原料供应和劳动力调配的困难。谭真代表批评计划中的混乱情况说，企业需要的原料前一年第三季就要提出计划，可是生产任务迟迟定不下来，企业只好乱订一番，等任务一下来，又要改变。
    上海市北京市代表小组有些代表批评了工业生产建设中的浪费现象。有的代表指出有些商品商业部门积压，而工业部门产品计划还未削减。有的代表谈到现在有的企业已经建设起来，才发现品种不符合需要，但是改变产品型号十分困难，造成很大浪费。有些代表还提出地方上有些负责干部喜欢搞大的、高标准建设，他们希望中央负责干部下到地方具体检查，纠正这种浪费现象。在北京市代表小组会上，许多代表对城市建设计划不周、工厂非生产人员过多和工厂奖金不合理等问题提出了意见。
    江西、河北等代表小组在讨论中，不少代表批评了某些厂、矿企业中非直接生产人员过多的情况。河北省代表、第二机械工业部工程师昝凌说，有些工厂因为非生产人员过多，使生产成本增加了一倍左右。江西省代表吴有训对某些企业、机关盲目招收人员的缺点提出了批评。他认为生产人员和非生产人员的增加要有一定比例，有关部门要加以控制。
　　改革耕作技术不要盲目  兴办水利必须注意勤俭
    在几个小组会上，许多代表对政府的农林水利工作提出了意见。江西代表邵式平、刘俊秀认为，农业既要有重点又要注意全面发展，对于农林水利投资的分配，中央多、地方少是不合理的。河北代表、政协河北省委员会副主席王葆真建议国家增加水利投资，以便预防和减免水灾对农业生产的危害。山西代表、晋南专署副专员李辉说，要使粮食增产，必须改革耕作技术；要改革耕作技术，必须进行深入的调查研究，找出可以改革的条件，切不要主观主义地盲目改革。她以晋南地区今年麦子减产为例，说明盲目改革耕作技术的危害性。她建议中央对改革耕作技术问题要慎重研究。
    山东省代表、农业部副部长何基浓说，花钱多不一定能把事办好，花钱少也不一定办不好事情。他批评水利部在工作上缺乏勤俭办事业的精神。他说，去年水利部兴修的水利，灌溉一亩田平均要二十到三十元。可是由群众兴办的水利就花钱很少。四川省官渠堰由地方领导机关和群众兴修，每亩田平均只投资二元多。
　　学生的劳动生产教育应当加强  边远地区文教经费要适当照顾
    在贵州、广西、河北和山东等省的代表小组讨论会上，许多代表对学生的劳动教育、边远地区文教事业发展不平衡等问题提出了意见。他们认为，目前多数高等学校毕业生轻视劳动，而国家又多是把他们分配在领导机关和研究机关工作，只有少数才下放到基层单位，这种情况需要加以改变。广西小组有些代表在发言中认为今后必须加强学生的劳动生产教育，尽可能地将中等学校设在乡村，既节省费用，又可避免学生因受城市物质生活的影响在毕业后不愿回到农村去的后果。共青团广西省委第一书记潘古说，今年南宁各中学所招的三千名中学生，其中有60％都是来自农村，如果其他问题解决得好，将中学搬到农村去办是完全可能的。贵州代表提出文教经费的支出应当适当照顾边远地区。贵州是多灾地区，文教事业不发达，和一些大城市和别的省份比较相差悬殊过大。
    内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、青海、西藏、昌都、福建等代表小组，有的抽出一部分时间进行座谈，有的继续阅读文件。四川、湖北等省的代表今天集中批判了资产阶级右派分子的错误言论。江西代表组连日来在讨论中，代表们纷纷驳斥资产阶级右派分子反社会主义反对党的领导的谬论，他们表示要坚决同这个省所选出的代表罗隆基划清思想界限。
