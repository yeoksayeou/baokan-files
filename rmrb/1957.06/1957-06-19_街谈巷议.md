Street Talk

　　The "Leader's Seats" are Gone
　　In the past, when I attended cultural performances in Harbin, I always saw the first few rows in the middle with "Leader's Seats" signs, filled with leaders, their wives, and many children. Recently, at the Party Congress, representatives seriously criticized some leading cadres for their privileged lifestyle, including their tendency to separate themselves from the masses by not eating or watching movies with them. At the movie night on June 4th, the "Leader's Seats" were gone, and the leaders sat with the masses. I think this small thing should be considered a new phenomenon after the rectification campaign began, and it is worth welcoming. (Harbin, Xi Guang)

　　Excessive Democracy
　　Recently, the following happened in an enterprise:
　　As the weather got hotter, the work schedule was adjusted. According to the new schedule, the cafeteria manager wanted to change the lunch serving time from 11:00-13:00 to 10:45-12:15, but he couldn't make the decision himself, so he submitted it to the director of the general affairs office for approval. The director looked at it and felt that it was not within his authority to decide, so he forwarded it to the head of the enterprise. After reading it, the head felt that this was a matter of "several hundred employees eating," which was a matter of their immediate interests, and should follow the mass line. He wrote "Handed over to the workers who eat in the cafeteria for a meeting decision" in large characters on the report.
　　In my opinion, this is excessive democracy. (Bengbu, Anhui, Jiang He)

　　Also Discussing "Killing the Son" Plays
　　Comrade Wu Zuguang, in his article "Plays Like 'Killing the Son'", mentioned that if international friends saw "Killing the Son", they would have good reason to say that our country is a completely backward, barbaric, and ignorant country. I, however, thought of our children. What will happen to them when they see plays like "Killing the Son" and "Huangshi Woman's Journey to the Underworld"?
　　Children are naive, they cannot distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and they can only be poisoned. Watching plays like "Killing the Son" and "Huangshi Woman's Journey to the Underworld" will surely turn our children into backward, barbaric, and ignorant people.
　　I am not against letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom, but in order to cultivate successors to socialism, I request the Ministry of Culture to seriously reconsider banning plays like "Killing the Son." If someone thinks I am trying to hinder the contention of a hundred schools of thought and the blooming of a hundred flowers, then I want to ask: Isn't the contention of a hundred schools of thought and the blooming of a hundred flowers for socialism? (Beijing, Xiao Wu)

　　The Use of the Five-Pointed Star
　　The abuse of the five-pointed star as decoration has become a trend. Five-pointed stars are everywhere, on straw hats, towels, floors, ceilings, tableware, spittoons, and even on wire fences. Is it not possible to use some beautiful patterns to replace them on these objects? Perhaps these people are doing it out of good intentions, but they are ruining our beloved five-pointed star. (Nanjing, Chu Weifu)

　　街谈巷议
　　“首长席”取消了
    过去我曾参加过哈尔滨市举办的文娱晚会，总见前边几排中间座位上贴有“首长席”的纸贴，座上满坐着首长一些首长夫人，还有不少孩子。最近，在党代会上，代表们曾严肃地批评了某些领导干部生活特殊化，连吃饭、看电影都不愿和群众在一起等脱离群众的倾向。6月4日的电影晚会上，“首长席”不见了，首长和群众坐在一起了。这点微小的事情，我看也应当认为是整风开始后的新气象。值得欢迎。　（哈尔滨晞光）
　　未免极端民主
    有一个企业里，最近发生了这样一件事：
    天气热了，作息时间有所变动。食堂管理员根据新的作息制度，想把午餐开饭时间由原来的十一时至十三时改为十时三刻至十二时一刻，但是他不能作主，就呈请总务室主任批示。主任看了，觉得也不是他权力范围内所能决定的，又转呈企业首长。首长看后，感到这是关系“几百个职工吃饭”的切身利益问题，应该走群众路线，就在这份报告上批了“交由吃伙职工开会决定”几个大字。
    我看，这未免极端民主。
    （安徽蚌埠江禾）
　　也谈“杀子报”
    吴祖光同志在他的“杀子报这样的戏里”一文里，谈到，假如国际友人看了“杀子报”，有充分的理由说我们的国家是一个十足落后的、野蛮的、愚昧的国家。我却想到我们的孩子，他们看了“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”这样的戏，将会怎样呢？
    孩子是幼稚的，他们不能辨别香花毒草，他们只有中毒的份儿。看了“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”这样的戏，肯定说将使我们的孩子变成落后的、野蛮的、愚昧的。
    我不反对百家争鸣、百花齐放，但是为了培养社会主义的接班人，我要求文化部重新重虑禁演“杀子报”这样的戏。如果有人认为我这是想阻碍百家争鸣、百花齐放，那末我要问：难道百家争鸣、百花齐放，不是为了社会主义吗？
    （北京萧伍）
　　五角星的用场
    现在滥用五角星作装饰，已经成风了。五角星到处可见，草帽、毛巾上有五角星，地板天花板上有五角星，饭具痰盂上也有五角星，甚至铁丝网栅栏门上也有铁丝网编上几只五角星。难道在这些物件上就不能用些美丽的图案来代替吗？也许这些人们是出于好意，可是他们把我们喜爱的五角星糟蹋得不像样子了。　（南京初维富）
