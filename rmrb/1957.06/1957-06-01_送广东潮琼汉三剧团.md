Sending off the Guangdong Chao, Qiong, and Han Opera Troupes
Tian Han

The Guangdong Chao, Qiong, and Han Opera Troupes have successfully concluded their performance report in Beijing and are about to leave Beijing separately. The members of these troupes include many senior outstanding artists such as Hong Miao, Wang Huangwen, Wang Fengmei, and Huang Guizhu, as well as a very talented younger generation. They have shown great achievements in the excavation and arrangement of performance programs, the arrangement and organization of music and vocal music, and the study of performance and directing arts. At the symposium held yesterday by the Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Dramatists Association, and the Academy of Chinese Opera, everyone also raised some opinions on what they should improve.

It is not easy for these comrades from the southern border of the motherland, whose footprints have reached Southeast Asia, to come to Beijing once. At the moment of parting, what is good to send them? In ancient times, there was a custom of sending off with willow branches, so I will write three poems to replace the willow branches. May 30th

　　Chao Opera

It is said that Huang Wu Niang is affectionate, and Yao Xuanqiu and Wu Shui are fragrant. The slender willows by the lake welcome the jade pendants, and the famous bridge on the river walks with phoenixes. The Dharma music has long been passed down in the sea countries, and the Chao accent has now moved the palace walls. It is hard to forget the night when the flowers fall and the waves are clear, and the heart-stirring "Sweeping the Window" is heard.

　　*Yao Xuanqiu of Chaozhou and Su Wushui of southern Fujian are both famous for performing "Chen San Wu Niang." I once watched Xuanqiu perform this in Shantou. The local scenery of Chao opera is warm and beautiful, no less than Liyuan opera. *West Lake in Chaozhou is said to be the place where Huang Wu Niang loved to visit. The West Lake Chronicle records the story of Wu Niang, and there is Mao Garden nearby, which is Wu Niang's home. *There is Xiangzi Bridge on the Han River, and it is said that Chen San and Wu Niang eloped here. *Chao opera, Yue opera, Qiong opera, and Han opera are all very popular in various ports in Southeast Asia. Hong Miao, a famous Laodan in Chao opera, is well-known in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. *Chao opera, Qiong opera, and Han opera were performed in Huairen Hall in Beijing, and Chairman Mao personally went on stage to give the actors great encouragement. *"Sweeping the Window Meeting" depicts Gao Wenzhu recognizing his wife, which is the same story as the "Flower Pavilion Meeting" or "Overnight at the Flower Pavilion" in Bangzi Ping opera, but the treatment is different. The lyrics of Chao opera are elegant and refined, with a chorus, influenced by Southern opera and Yiyang tune.

　　Qiong Opera

Fengmei is old and Hongmei is red again, with wonderful dances, clear songs, and many talents. It is unbearable for Wenxiu to have his cup stolen, and Maofang happens to meet a dog carrying a hairpin. Dialects and local languages ​​produce pearls and jade, and ancient tunes and new voices are tailored. The older generation cultivates and the younger generation continues, and there should be a hundred flowers blooming in Hainan.

　　*Wang Fengmei is a famous Dan in Qiong opera, famous throughout Qiong and Nanyang, and is now over sixty years old. The rising Hongmei has an elegant and profound artistic style. I once saw her play the villain Chen in "Dog Carrying a Golden Hairpin." *Zhang Wenxiu lived in his father-in-law's house and was harmed by his brother-in-law who stole his jade cup. Later, he became famous and avenged himself. Hongmei, Chen Hua, Mo Aihua, Wang Yingrong, and others performed this. *"Dog Carrying a Golden Hairpin" tells the story of Mo Ziqing's wife, Chen, suspecting that Mo's younger brother, Mei Maofang, stole her false bun and golden hairpin, insulting him, causing discord between Maofang and his wife. Later, it was discovered that it was carried away by a dog. The Mo family picked it up and returned it to Chen, and a storm subsided. The story is plain but the performance is full of ups and downs and humor. *Qiong opera absorbs Yiyang Erhuang Bangzi tunes from Hainan Island folk opera and Min-Guang local tunes, and uses Hainan dialect to form today's form. The performance and body movements are also influenced by Kunqu and Beijing opera. *There are still many senior artists in Hainan opera, including famous Laodan Wang Fengmei and famous Laosheng Wang Huangwen.

　　Han Opera

Huang Guizhu has been away from the stage for seven years, and she will not use her shirt and fan to please the Donghu. The pipa sound is激越 and penetrates the clouds, and the Qin language is low and cries like a partridge. Bai Lixi can recognize his wife in purple clothes, and Lan Zhen sheds red tears and plans for her husband. In recent years, Han opera has become delicate and skillful, and ancient tunes should be played towards the Chu capital.

　　*Guangdong Han opera, also known as Waijiang opera, is Han opera that has been enriched by Chaozhou music after entering Guangdong. Huang Guizhu is a famous Dan in Guangdong Han opera, with a voice that can be high or low, sweet and peerless. During the Japanese occupation of Chaozhou and Shantou, she stopped performing and returned to farming for seven years. She only returned to the stage after liberation. *Huang Linchuan, a famous Laosheng in Han opera, has a desolate and majestic singing voice. His performance of "Bai Lixi Recognizing His Wife" is a perfect match with Huang Guizhu. *Young actors Liang Suzhen and others perform "Pan Fu", with delicate and beautiful singing and acting, which is very popular with the audience. *The singing tone of Laosheng and Hongjing in Hubei Han opera is high, and they use falsetto, which is quite controversial. Qingyi often takes small tones and does not pay much attention to reporting words, often deviating from the emotions of the characters. I have discussed this with comrades Wu Tianbao and Chen Bohua. The Han opera troupe is going to perform in Wuhan, and I think they should learn from Guangdong Han opera.

    送广东潮琼汉三剧团
    田汉
    广东潮琼汉剧团来京汇报演出已胜利结束，就要分别离京了。这些剧团成员包含了许多前辈优秀艺人如洪妙、王黄文、王凤梅、黄桂珠等，和极有才华的青年一代。在演出节目的发掘整理，音乐声腔的安排组织，表导演艺术的琢磨都表现了很好成就。对于他们应该改进之处，在昨天文化部、剧协、戏曲研究院召开的座谈会上大家也提了些意见。
    这些剧团的同志们远处祖国南部边疆，足迹及于东南亚，来一次北京真不是易事。临别依依，送他们什么好呢？古人有折柳送行的风气，就写诗三律，代替柳枝吧。五月三十日
          潮剧
    争说多情黄五娘，璇秋乌水?各芬芳。湖边细柳迎环珮?，江上名桥走凤凰?。法曲久曾传海国?，潮音今已动宫墙?。难忘花落波清夜，荡气回肠听“扫窗”?。
    ?潮州姚璇秋，闽南苏乌水都以演“陈三五娘”著名。尝在汕头观璇秋演此，潮剧本地风光，热情婉丽，不减梨园戏。?潮州西湖相传黄五娘爱游处，西湖志载五娘事，附近有茂园即五娘家。?韩江上有湘子桥，相传陈三、五娘偕遁经此。?潮剧与粤、琼、汉各剧在东南亚各埠都颇盛行。潮剧老旦洪妙就驰名泰国、越南、马来亚一带。?潮剧与琼、汉剧入京曾在怀仁堂演出，毛主席亲到台上给了演员们极大鼓励。?“扫窗会”写高文举认妻，与梆子评剧的“花亭会”或“夜宿花亭”同一故事，而处理不同。潮剧词句雅驯，有帮腔，受南戏和弋阳腔影响。
          琼剧
    凤梅垂老又红梅?，舞妙歌清几俊材。文秀不堪人盗盏?，茂芳偏遇狗衔钗?。方言土语生珠玉，古调新声?入剪裁。老辈耕耘新辈继?，海南应有百花开。
    ?王凤梅系琼剧名旦，驰名全琼与南洋各地，现已六十余。后起的红梅，艺风流丽而深刻。曾见她演“狗衔金钗”中的反派陈氏。?张文秀寄寓岳丈家，被其襟兄盗玉盏堕害。后成名复仇。红梅与陈华、莫爱花、王英蓉等演此。?“狗衔金钗”写莫子卿妻陈氏疑莫义弟梅茂芳偷去她的义髻和金钗，加以侮辱，使茂卿夫妻失和，后发觉是被狗子衔去，莫氏拾得还给陈氏，一场风波才平息。故事平淡而演出极富波澜和风趣。?琼剧从海南岛民间小戏、闽广土曲、吸取弋阳二黄梆子曲调，改用海南方言，形成今天的形式。表演身段也受昆京剧影响。?海南戏前辈艺人尚多，名旦王凤梅外有名老生王黄文等。
          汉剧
    罢舞七年黄桂珠?，不将衫扇媚东胡。琶声激越穿云汉，琴语低徊泣鹧鸪。百里紫衣能认妇?，兰贞红泪且盘夫?。年来汉戏流纤巧，古调应弹向楚都?。
    ?广东汉剧，亦称外江戏，是汉剧入粤后又被潮州音乐丰富了的。黄桂珠系广东汉剧名旦，嗓音能高能低，甜润绝世。在日帝侵陷潮汕时，罢演归农达七年之久，解放后才重上舞台。?黄麟传汉剧名老生，歌喉苍凉雄浑，演“百里奚认妻”与黄桂珠珠联璧合。　?青年演员梁素珍等演“盘夫”，唱做细腻圆丽，极受观众喜爱。?湖北汉剧老生红净等唱腔调门高，使用假嗓，争论颇多。青衣多走小腔，不甚注意报字，每脱离人物感情。此意曾与吴天保、陈伯华同志等谈过。汉剧团将到武汉演出，我以为应向广东汉剧学习。
