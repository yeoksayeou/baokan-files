    Thoughts After "Untitled"
    Zhōng Huái

    Mr. Lú Yùwén, at an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), spoke about breaking down "walls" from both sides and raised some objections to certain people's criticisms of the Communist Party. As a result, anonymous letters arrived, filled with insults and threats: "Accomplice of the tiger," "Utterly shameless," "Turn back early," "You will not be forgiven"...

    "Reason prevails everywhere." To be unable to convince people with reason and instead try to silence them by writing intimidating anonymous letters is truly "utterly shameless!"

    Those who have such thoughts and actions should "turn back early"!
          ＊
    At a symposium to help the Communist Party with rectification, someone said: "The Party has reached a moment of crisis!" "The Party is about to collapse!"

    I don't think so. Who has ever seen a party on the verge of collapse not only openly expose its own shortcomings and errors but also send invitations to non-Party members to criticize it extensively?

    The Communist Party is not afraid of exposing contradictions or launching criticisms. The more it is criticized, the healthier it becomes. Every time it goes through a rectification, there will be a new and greater victory.

    Those who say this may not understand this point. But sometimes, they cannot help but reveal their wishful thinking.

    无题有感

    卢郁文先生在民革中央小组扩大会议上，说了些拆“墙”须从两方面来拆的话，提了点不同意某些人对共产党的批评的意见，于是匿名信来了，辱骂和威胁来了：“为虎作伥”，“无耻之尤”，“及早回头”，“不会饶恕你的”……。
    “有理走遍天下”。不能以理服人，而想依靠写恫吓的匿名信的办法封人之口，这才真是“无耻之尤”！
    有这种想法和做法的，还是“及早回头”吧！
          ＊
    在帮助共产党整风的座谈会上，有人说：“党已经到了面临危机的时候了！”“现在党快垮台了！”
    我看不然。谁曾看到有哪一个行将垮台的政党，不仅自己公开揭发自己的缺点错误，而且下请帖邀请党外人士来大肆批评呢？
    共产党是不怕揭露矛盾、展开批评的。越批评越健康。每经过一次整风，就有一次新的更大的胜利。
    说这话的，也未必不懂得这一点。不过有时候情不自禁，就难免吐露出自己的一相情愿的想法来了。
