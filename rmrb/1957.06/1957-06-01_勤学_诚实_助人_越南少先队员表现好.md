Diligent Study, Honesty, Helping Others
Vietnamese Young Pioneers Perform Well

    This newspaper reports: The 300,000 Young Pioneers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have played an exemplary leading role in both their studies and social service work. Their academic performance is generally above average. In Haiphong, the Young Pioneers organized 391 "teaching friend" groups, helping more than 2,000 out-of-school children learn to read.
    The Young Pioneers' "honesty" campaign has had a very good impact in society and at home. The "Wu Jia Kan Squad" in Haiphong found four million piasters, fifteen qian of gold, and three watches, all of which were returned to their owners.
    The activities of the Young Pioneers have penetrated into the countryside. In the third and fourth inter-zones of North Vietnam, they organized many "cattle herding groups" to feed the cattle well, and they also helped each other to prevent livestock from trampling crops. Many "little teachers" wearing red scarves have emerged in the movement to eliminate illiteracy. The Young Pioneers have also launched a "help military dependents and families of martyrs" movement.

    勤学　诚实　助人
    越南少先队员表现好
    本报讯　越南民主共和国的三十万少年先锋队队员，在学习和社会服务工作中，都起了模范带头作用。他们的学习成绩一般都在平均水平之上。海防的少先队组织了三百九十一个“教友”小组，帮助二千多个失学的小朋友认字。
    少先队的“诚实”运动在社会和家庭中产生很好的影响。海防的“吴嘉坎小队”，拾到四百万块钱、十五钱黄金和三只手表，都交还给失主。
    少先队的活动深入农村。在北越第三、第四联区，他们组织了许多“看牛组”，把牛喂得胖胖的，还互相帮助，防止耕畜践踏庄稼。在扫除文盲运动中，出现许多带红领巾的小先生。少先队队员们还发动了“帮助军属烈属”运动。（附图片）
