The Ministry of Education Has Not Seriously Studied Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education
—An Interview with Guan Shixiong, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education
By our reporter Sun Zunian

Guan Shixiong, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education, criticized the Ministry of Education's attitude towards workers' and peasants' spare-time education as "caring for the son but not the father" at a symposium of non-Party bureau directors and deputy directors convened by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Because the meeting was mainly for offering opinions to the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, he did not elaborate on this criticism. After the meeting, the reporter interviewed Deputy Director Guan Shixiong.

How should we understand the statement that the Ministry of Education "cares for the son but not the father"? Our conversation started with this topic. He said with a smile: "Not only the Ministry of Education, but also all sectors of society have the phenomenon of valuing children's education over parents' education, caring about the education of employees' children but not caring about the education of the employees themselves. Workers' and peasants' spare-time education is a new undertaking with many problems and little experience. If we do not rely on those in charge of production to also manage culture, and if we do not rely on the support and attention of the Party, government, labor unions, and the Communist Youth League, we cannot do a good job relying on the efforts of any one party."

"Of course, workers' and peasants' spare-time education has its own characteristics, and mistakes will inevitably occur if schooling is not conducted in conjunction with these characteristics. We all share responsibility for these mistakes. However, as the leading authority for education nationwide – the Ministry of Education – lacks serious research on several major issues, resulting in serious problems in guiding ideology and several major measures." "Caring for the son but not the father" does not mean that the Ministry of Education does not care about workers' and peasants' spare-time education, that is, adult education, but rather that its management is impractical and there is serious dogmatism and subjectivism.

Workers' and peasants' spare-time education work mainly consists of two major items: First, literacy, which is for the entire population. Second, spare-time middle and primary schools, which are for a portion of the population, mainly cadres, workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen. In recent years, the Ministry of Education's leadership over workers' and peasants' spare-time education has shown a disconnect from reality and great instability. When deviations occur in actual work, they often do not first examine themselves, improve and strengthen workers' and peasants' spare-time education work, but always criticize those below for failing to grasp their intentions, as if the Ministry of Education has always been completely correct. Whether it is correct or not, the facts are the best answer.

Workers' and peasants' spare-time middle and primary schools should have the characteristics of being for adults, being spare-time, and serving production. They should be different from regular ordinary middle and primary schools. However, the Ministry of Education mixed up the requirements of the two. By the end of 1955, the Ministry of Education put forward the slogan that workers' and peasants' spare-time middle and primary schools should "actively develop, strive for standardization, and improve quality." The most prominent example of good intentions leading to bad results was the "strive for standardization" policy.

The Ministry of Education's requirement for workers' and peasants' spare-time middle and primary schools to "strive for standardization" not only required the standardization of the teaching system but also the standardization of the teaching plan. Their reasoning was that "workers' and peasants' spare-time education is of the nature of general education." This is correct. But they forgot that workers and peasants have the characteristics of being adults and serving production. It is wrong to simply stipulate that workers' and peasants' spare-time middle and primary schools uniformly adopt textbooks and teaching plans of regular middle and primary schools. This will cause tension and confusion in teaching. To meet this requirement, textbooks compiled by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education in the past, based on the different objects of workers and peasants, had to be abandoned.

Mechanically transplanting a set of regular primary and secondary schools in the teaching plan; workers' and peasants' spare-time primary schools stipulate five courses: Chinese, history, geography, nature, and arithmetic. Middle schools have these courses: literature, Chinese, algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, history, and geography. The sudden separation of literature and Chinese also caused ideological confusion among teachers and students. Chinese is a set of phonetics, writing, vocabulary, grammar, rhetoric, Chinese characters, Chinese character reform, word meaning, dictionary, summary of word classes, summary of sentence structure, sentences and sentence components, nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliary words, etc. Literature is three poems from the Book of Songs, Selected Poems of Du Fu, Su Shi lyrics, ten Tang poems, structural analysis of literary works, fables, etc. After Deputy Director Guan Shixiong finished talking about the content of these courses, he immediately said in an analytical tone: "These contents are actually some model articles from ancient to modern times, and are selected readings of famous Chinese literary works. Some of them need to be learned, but they are not completely suitable for the needs of workers and peasants to learn as adults. It is not appropriate for ordinary primary and secondary school students. The purpose of workers and peasants learning Chinese is mainly to be able to read and write, so they require narrative, argumentative, and applied writing, etc. There are too many classical texts and the lessons are long, so workers and peasants cannot learn them. But the textbook editors say that lecturing on these articles lacks literary flavor and artistic image. The principle of worker and peasant education: It should be from the shallow to the deep, from the easy to the difficult, firmly grasp knowledge, and apply what you learn. The Ministry of Education's simple and rigid regulations on workers' and peasants' spare-time middle and primary school textbooks are contrary to this. In fact, some courses are only taught in universities, but are now taught in middle and primary schools, which is not in line with the principles of workers' and peasants' spare-time education. We admit that part of this content is good, but it should be distinguished and cannot be without the object. If you don’t distinguish the object, you will make jokes, such as talking about the first poem "Papaya" in the Book of Songs, and the students don’t know why. Male employees said that they can’t use it to write love letters, and the women laughed and said, where is this in love, and send papayas, where to find this "wooden melon, is this deliberately embarrassing the other party."

They once calculated that, according to this content, a worker or peasant needs more than 20 years from literacy to graduation from middle school. Some middle-aged employees jokingly said after studying these courses: "By the time I graduate, my graduation certificate will be pasted on the head of the coffin." Because the original cultural level of workers and peasants is low, and they are learning in their spare time, the content of the course is heavy and difficult to understand. In fact, they can’t learn well or finish it. Teachers have to compress teaching hours to catch up with the progress, so many chapters can’t be learned. The students have a lot of opinions, saying that this method of learning is "planting sesame seeds in eighteen acres of land, one tree in the east and one tree in the west, and nothing can be learned well."

In the leadership of literacy work, the Ministry of Education is also swaying. Two major leaps forward and two major retreats made those below unable to breathe. In 1952, the rapid literacy method was widely promoted, and the Ministry of Education allocated a large amount of money to engage full-time teachers, and even paid for kerosene for lighting in literacy points at night. They came up with a set of methods: what to concentrate on literacy, using methods such as "attacking fortresses and breaking through dead corners." When cadres went down to promote it, farmers were so frightened that they hid under the bed. In 1953, the Ministry of Education suddenly made a major rectification, loudly criticizing those below for being impatient, rash, detached from production, and detached from the masses, and poured a large basin of cold water on them severely. Then the literacy work immediately retreated and entered a period of decline. The outstanding problems were ignored by the Ministry of Education. For example, nearly 400 full-time literacy teachers equipped in Beijing immediately had nowhere to place them. We had to find our own way; some have not been placed until now. With the high tide of socialist transformation, the Ministry of Education's brains got hot again, and they went down to conduct investigations and quickly promoted it to the bottom, proving that a township and a society can completely eliminate illiteracy within two or three years. At the end of 1955, the Ministry of Education formally required the elimination of illiteracy among existing employees within two or three years, specifically stipulating that employees in commerce, textiles, heavy industry, light industry, electricity, and railway systems should eliminate illiteracy in 1957; employees in coal mines, seafarers, construction, and transportation should eliminate illiteracy in 1958. In the spring of 1956, the Ministry of Education held a conference on employee education. One day, the Ministry of Education suddenly called the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education and said: "The capital must take the lead, and the speed of literacy must be accelerated. The 1956 literacy target will be increased from the original 90,000 to 140,000." This is truly a mythical number. But in 1956, the literacy work in the country was once again impatient and rash. The Ministry of Education did not criticize itself. They said that the national requirement for seven years was not wrong, but the fault was that those below did it badly: the province required five years, the city and county required two or three years, and the district and township required one year or half a year to eliminate illiteracy. Each level required more urgently and more tightly, so "it is enough to prove" that there was a mistake below. But in my opinion, the fact that each level requires more tightly enough to shows the enthusiasm for the work, and whether it is possible to eliminate illiteracy nationwide in seven years must be reconsidered. In short, the Ministry of Education's performance in literacy work shows: "When it gets hot, it is terrible, and when it gets cold, no one cares about it. Subjectivism is very serious." Deputy Director Guan Shixiong finally said: Our country is based on the worker-peasant alliance, but it is strange that society does not pay enough attention to and support the spare-time cultural learning of workers and peasants. They arbitrarily occupy the spare-time cultural learning time of employees. I think that even the Minister comrades of our Central Ministry of Education have probably not seriously and systematically studied workers' and peasants' spare-time education. Some leaders have never placed worker and peasant education in an important position. There are no workers and peasants in their minds. They only say grandly how much they value it when introducing our education to foreign delegations. In fact, in their work, when they talk about it, it is the problem of middle and primary school graduates participating in labor. It is right to attach importance to this issue; but workers' and peasants' spare-time education is also important, and the two are equally important. Students' extracurricular labor should be placed in an equally important position as workers' and peasants' spare-time learning. This is the combination of mental and physical labor education, and this is the all-round development of communist education. Neglecting worker and peasant education is the viewpoint of the bourgeoisie. I hope that the Ministry of Education will seriously and earnestly examine this issue in the rectification movement.

    教育部没有认真研究工农业余教育
    ——访北京市工农业余教育局副局长关世雄
    本报记者　孙祖年
    北京市工农业余教育局副局长关世雄，在中共北京市委召集的非党局长、副局长座谈会上，批评中央教育部对工农业余教育的态度是“管儿子不管爸爸”。因为这个会议主要是对市委、市人民委员会提意见，他没有就这个批评作详细说明。会后，记者又走访了关世雄副局长。
    教育部对工农业余教育是“管儿子不管爸爸”，这话应怎样来理解呢？我们的谈话就是从这个主题谈起的。他笑着说：“不单是教育部，社会上各方面都存在着重视儿子学习不重视爸爸学习的现象，关心职工子弟的学习，不关心职工的学习。工农业余教育是一项新的事业，问题很多，经验很少，如果不依靠管生产的人兼管文化，不依靠党、政、工、团各方面的支持和重视，只靠任何一方面的努力是搞不好的。”
    “当然工农业余教育有其特点，不结合特点来办学必然会发生错误，这些错误，对我们从事工农教育工作的人，大家都有一份责任。但是作为全国教育的领导机关——中央教育部对若干重大问题缺少认真研究，因而在指导思想上和几项重大措施上产生了严重的问题。”“管儿子不管爸爸”，不是说教育部对工农业余教育，也就是对成人的教育没有管，而是管的不实际，存在着严重的教条主义、主观主义。
    工农业余教育工作，主要是两大项：一是扫盲，这是全民性的。二是业余中、小学，这是部分人参加学习的，主要对象是干部、职工、农民和手工业者。几年来，教育部对工农业余教育的领导，表现了脱离实际，摇摆性很大。当实际工作中发生了偏差，他们往往不是首先检查自己，改进和加强工农业余教育工作，总是批评下面不能领会他们的意图，好像教育部向来都是十分正确似的。正确与否，事实是最好的回答。
    工农业余中、小学应该具有成人的、业余的、为生产服务的特点，它和正规的普通中、小学应有区别。但是，教育部把两者的要求混同起来了。到1955年底，教育部提出这样的口号，要工农业余中、小学“积极发展，力求正规，提高质量”。好事办坏最突出地表现在“力求正规”的方针上。
    教育部对工农业余中、小学要求“力求正规”，不仅是要求教学制度的正规，也要求教学计划的正规。他们的理由是，“工农业余教育是普通教育性质”。这是对的。但他们忘掉了工农具有成人的特点，和为生产服务的特点，单纯规定工农业余中、小学，一律采用正规中、小学的课本和教学计划是错误的。这样会在教学上引起紧张和混乱。为了达到这个要求，过去北京市工农业余教育局根据工农不同的对象所编写的课本只好放弃不用。
    在教学计划上机械搬运普通中小学的一套；工农业余小学规定五门课程：语文、历史、地理、自然、算术。中学是这几门课程：文学、汉语、代数、几何、物理、化学、历史、地理。文学与汉语的突然分家也造成教师、学员的思想混乱。汉语是从语音、文字、词汇、语法、修辞、汉字、汉字改革、词义、字典、词类概要、句法概要、句子和句子的成分，名词、动词、形容词、代词、副词、介词、连词、助词等一套。文学是诗经三篇，杜甫诗选，苏轼词，唐诗十首，文学作品结构分析，寓言等。关世雄副局长讲完了这些课程的内容以后，紧接着带分析的口吻说：“这些内容，实际上是从古到今的一些范文，是中国文学名著选读，有一些是要学的；但这不完全适合工农成人学习的需要。就是对普通中小学学生也不适当。工农学习语文的目的主要为了能看能写，因此他们要求有叙述文、说理文、应用文等。那些古典文太多、课文长，工农是学习不了的。但是编课本的先生们说讲这些文章没有文学味道，缺少艺术形象。工农教育的原则：应该是由浅到深，由易到难，巩固地掌握知识，并且学以致用。教育部对工农业余中、小学教材简单硬性的规定恰与此相反。事实上，有些课是大学才讲的，而现在在中、小学就讲了，这是不符合工农业余教育的原则的。我们承认这些内容有一部分是好的，但应加以区别，不能不分对象。不分对象就要闹出笑话，如讲文学课诗经三篇的第一首诗“木瓜”，学员们听了不知所以然，男职工说写情书也用不上，女的笑着说道，谈恋爱那有这事，还送木瓜，到那里去找这个“木头做的瓜，这不是故意同对方为难吗”。
    他们曾经算过一次账，按照这些内容学下去，一个工人、农民，从扫盲到中学毕业需要二十多年。有的中年职工学了这些课程后，开玩笑地说：“等到我毕业，毕业证书也就贴到棺材头上了”。由于工农原有文化水平低，而又是利用业余时间去学的，课程的内容份量重，难理解，事实上不仅学不好也学不完，教师只好压缩教时追赶进度，这样许多章节就不能学了。学员们很有意见，说这种学法是“十八亩地种芝麻，东一棵西一棵，什么也学不好”。
    在扫盲工作的领导上，教育部也是摇摆不定的。两次大冒进，两次大冒退，搞得下面喘不过气来。1952年普遍推广速成识字法，教育部拨了大批钱，搞专任教师，连晚上识字点灯的煤油也给开支。他们作出一套办法：什么为了识字注意力集中，采用“攻堡垒、突破死角”等方法。干部到下面去推广，农民给吓得躲到床底下去。到了1953年教育部又突然来了个大整顿，大声疾呼地批评下面急躁、冒进，脱离生产，脱离群众，狠狠地泼了一大盆冷水。接着扫盲工作马上来了个冒退，进入消沉阶段。遗留问题教育部不管了，如北京配备的近四百多个专任扫盲教师，马上就没有地方去安插。我们只好自己设法；还有的一直到现在没有安插。随着社会主义改造高潮，教育部的脑子又热了，又下去搞调查，很快地又向下面推广，证明一个乡、一个社两三年之内可以完全扫除文盲。1955年底，教育部又正式要求两三年内扫除现有职工中的文盲，具体规定：商业、纺织、重工业、轻工业、
  电业、铁路系统的职工1957年扫除文盲；煤矿、海员、建筑、搬运中的职工，1958年要扫除文盲。1956年春教育部开职工教育会议。有一天，教育部突然给北京市工农业余教育局来电话说：“首都要带头，扫盲速度要加快，一下要求把1956年扫盲事业指标由原定的九万人增加到十四万人。这真是神话般的数字。但是1956年扫除文盲工作在全国范围内又急躁冒进了，教育部批评的不是自己，他们说全国要求七年，没有错，错的是下面搞坏了：省要求五年，市、县要求两三年，区乡要求一年、半载扫盲。一层比一层要求急，要求紧，因此“足以证明”下面是搞错了。但是据我看来，一级比一级要求紧正足以表现工作的积极性，而全国要求七年扫盲是否可能却要重新考虑。总之，教育部对扫盲工作表现着：“一热起来不得了，一冷起来就没有人管，主观主义是非常严重的”。关世雄副局长最后说：我们的国家是以工农联盟为基础的国家，可是奇怪得很，社会上偏偏对工人农民的业余文化学习关心不够支持不够。任意侵占职工的业余文化学习时间。我看包括我们中央教育部的部长同志们，他们恐怕也没有认真地、有系统地研究过工农业余教育。有一些领导人员始终没有把工农教育放在重要的地位，脑子里是没有工人和农民的，只是在向外国代表团介绍我们教育事业时，才冠冕堂皇地说说如何如何重视。实际上在工作中，他们一谈起来，就是中、小学毕业生参加劳动的问题。重视这个问题是对的；但工农业余教育也是重要的，两者是同等重要的。学生的课余劳动应该与劳动者的业余学习放在同等重要的地位上去。这才是脑力劳动和体力劳动教育的结合，这才是共产主义的全面发展的教育，轻视工农教育，那是资产阶级的观点。在整风中希望教育部认真严肃地来检查这个问题。
