The CCP Central Committee and the State Council Seriously Deal with the Incident of Starvation Deaths in Guangxi Due to Disaster
Chen Manyuan, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Vice Governors Hao Zhongshi and Xiao Yizhou are Removed from Their Posts
The CCP Central Committee's Decision on Punishing Relevant Party Member Cadres
Guangxi Province experienced severe natural disasters in 1956. At that time, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee and the relevant prefectural and county Party committees developed serious complacency due to some achievements in their work since liberation and the victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture. They did not conduct in-depth investigations and studies, nor did they humbly listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the aforementioned disasters. In particular, because they disregarded the suffering of the people and relaxed the Party's political and ideological work, they failed to take effective measures in time when the disaster occurred to quickly stop the development of the disaster, resulting in serious incidents of large-scale famine and deaths of peasants in areas such as Pingle, Lipu, and Hengxian. Subsequently, although the Provincial Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, made improvements in disaster relief work and stopped the spring famine in 1957, it failed to summarize the experience and lessons, educate cadres to recognize the seriousness of their mistakes, and failed to take serious action against the relevant cadres who should be held responsible for a long time. This ideological style of seriously separating from the people and disregarding the lives of the people not only caused significant losses to the people's lives and property, but also seriously affected the prestige of the Party and the government among the people. In order to enforce Party discipline and educate all Party comrades, the CCP Central Committee, after listening to and discussing the inspection report of the Central Supervisory Committee, decided to give the relevant responsible persons of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, the Pingle Prefectural Party Committee, and the Pingle, Lipu, and Hengxian County Party Committees the following punishments:

(1) Comrade Chen Manyuan, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, because the province's work achievements have seriously developed complacency and bureaucratic work styles, neglecting political and ideological leadership, which has affected some leading cadres in certain areas to also develop complacency, disregard the suffering of the masses, and report good news but not bad. This situation made him underestimate the serious natural disasters and fail to strengthen the leadership of disaster relief work in a timely manner, eventually leading to serious incidents of large-scale famine and deaths of the masses. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from Party positions.

(2) Comrade Hao Zhongshi, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, served as Acting Governor during the disaster period (Governor Wei Guoqing was on official leave). Due to insufficient concern for the suffering of the masses and neglecting the severity of the disaster, he failed to actively take effective measures and failed to make the relevant departments of the Provincial People's Committee and the special commissioner's offices and county People's Committees do a good job in disaster relief. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from Party positions.

(3) Comrade Xiao Yizhou, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, was responsible for leading financial and grain work. Due to insufficient in-depth work, lack of understanding of the situation, and failure to recognize the severity of the disaster, he failed to lead the relevant departments to do a good job in the supply of grain in disaster relief in a timely manner, resulting in the aggravation of the disaster. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from Party positions.

(4) Comrade Yang Lin, Secretary of the Pingle Prefectural Party Committee, relied on some achievements in his work, was usually arrogant and complacent, blindly optimistic about the work in the area he led, and did not seriously understand the serious disaster situation, nor did he believe the reports from lower-level cadres. Before March 1956, he never sent anyone to inspect the disaster situation, and criticized cadres who reported production reduction and disaster as "rightists" at cadre meetings. Therefore, lower-level cadres did not dare to report the true situation of the disaster. When the disaster had already developed, Comrade Yang Lin also personally conducted investigations among cadres and disaster victims, and learned about some serious situations of starvation deaths and famine, but still did not pay enough attention to the disaster, mistakenly believing that it was only a problem of "some areas, a few townships, and individual households," so he did not report to the Provincial Party Committee in a timely manner, nor did he implement the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on disaster relief. Therefore, Comrade Yang Lin should be primarily responsible for the incident of deaths due to disaster in the Pingle area. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from work and probation within the Party for one year.

(5) Comrade He Shumin, Deputy Secretary of the Pingle Prefectural Party Committee, did not pay attention to the situation of production reduction due to disaster in some places in the district, and criticized cadres who reported production reduction due to disaster. When the disaster had already occurred and cadres from Gongcheng County reported to him about the disaster victims in Pingle fleeing to the county, he was still not vigilant, and therefore did not actively take effective measures to stop the development of the disaster. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from the post of Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee.

(6) Comrade Jiao Zhizhou, Secretary of the Pingle County Party Committee, criticized and suppressed cadres who reported production reduction and disaster, and still did not take effective measures when he discovered starvation deaths, causing lower-level cadres to delay the supply of grain and the distribution of relief funds. He should be primarily responsible for the serious situation of starvation deaths in the county. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from the post of Secretary of the County Party Committee.

(7) Comrade Wang Wenlu, Secretary of the Lipu County Party Committee, after reporting grain production reduction to the Prefectural Party Committee in 1955 and being criticized by Comrade Yang Lin, did not adhere to Party principles, followed Yang Lin's example, and criticized district and township cadres, making district and township cadres afraid to report the true situation of the disaster. After the disaster occurred in 1956, he did not pay attention to it, nor did he investigate and understand the situation, try to solve it, or report it to higher levels. He should be primarily responsible for the increasingly serious disaster, which caused serious consequences. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from the post of Secretary of the County Party Committee.

(8) Comrade Ai Zhiguo, Deputy Secretary of the Lipu County Party Committee, committed serious mistakes of commandism in the grain purchase work in 1955, and adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the disaster situation after the spring famine occurred in 1956. It is decided to give a serious warning.

(9) Comrade Xue Qiushui, Secretary of the Hengxian County Party Committee, not only failed to actively lead the county to do a good job in disaster relief after the disaster seriously developed, but also criticized and suppressed county and district cadres who reported the disaster, and ordered the county chief He Huajin to retrieve the disaster report he had signed and sent to the Zhou Prefectural Committee. He should be responsible for the serious incident of starvation deaths in the county. It is decided to give the punishment of probation within the Party for one year.

The State Council's Decision on Punishing Relevant Negligent Personnel

The 52nd plenary meeting of the State Council listened to the Ministry of Supervision's report on the incident of farmers fleeing famine and dying in large numbers in Guangxi Province due to disaster, and held that: In many areas of Guangxi Province, severe natural disasters occurred between 1955 and 1956. Due to the complacency of the leading cadres of the Provincial People's Committee and various relevant areas, who were satisfied with the victories of land reform and agricultural cooperation in recent years, they became blindly optimistic, relaxed their due vigilance against production reduction due to disaster, and failed to take effective measures in time to strengthen disaster relief work. Moreover, after the phenomenon of farmers fleeing famine and starvation had already occurred in 1955, they were still numb and could not learn from the facts, resulting in the serious situation of farmers fleeing famine and starvation in large numbers in Pingle, Lipu, Hengxian and other places in 1956. In recent years, the implementation of the national policy of unified purchase and sale of grain has guaranteed the grain supply for the people of the whole country, including the people in disaster areas, and has played a great role in helping the people in disaster areas overcome difficulties and tide over the disaster. However, the leading cadres of Guangxi Province, due to their serious separation from the masses in their work and their lack of understanding of the situation, underestimated the development of the disaster, and therefore failed to lead the relevant departments to correctly implement this policy and do a good job in grain scheduling and supply in a timely manner, so they were unable to stop the expansion of the disaster.

After serious shortcomings occurred in the disaster relief work in 1955, the State Council instructed that production-based disaster relief work must be strengthened, and negligent cadres with serious circumstances should be dealt with seriously. Although the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee has corrected the shortcomings in disaster relief work since the second half of 1956, and has also taken effective measures in the spring famine of 1957, it has been slow to deal with the cadres above the county level who should be responsible for deaths due to disaster, so it cannot distinguish right from wrong among the masses and cannot educate the cadres. The Guangxi Provincial People's Committee's style of disregarding the safety of people's lives and its serious dereliction of duty not only caused losses to the people's lives and property, but also seriously damaged the prestige of the People's Government among the masses. All departments of the State Council and local People's Committees at all levels should draw profound lessons from this incident, and must give sufficient concern to issues related to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people; for errors that have begun to be exposed in their work, they should promptly conduct in-depth inspections and take necessary measures to correct them in order to prevent the expansion of errors.

In order to enforce national discipline and educate state workers, the State Council decided to give the relevant responsible persons of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee and the Pingle Special Commissioner's Office and Lipu County People's Committee the following punishments:

Hao Zhongshi, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, actually served as the Acting Governor during the absence of Governor Wei Guoqing due to official duties. He failed to grasp the disaster relief work in the disaster, seriously derelict in his duties, and attempted to evade responsibility during the subsequent inspection. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from office.

Xiao Yizhou, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, was responsible for finance and grain work, underestimated the situation of grain production reduction, and failed to do a good job in grain supply in disaster relief work in a timely manner. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from office.

Chen Manyuan, member of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee and First Secretary of the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee, has been given the punishment of removal from office by the CCP Central Committee due to serious dereliction of duty. It is decided to remove him from his position as a member of the Provincial People's Committee.

Duan Shuxiang, Deputy Commissioner of the Pingle Special Commissioner's Office, was responsible for controlling grain work, did not pay attention to the disaster situation, and was not timely in supplying grain for disaster relief. It is decided to give the punishment of removal from office.

Li Shanben, Deputy County Chief of Lipu County, delayed the disaster relief instructions issued by the Special Commissioner's Office for half a month after the disaster occurred in 1956, and failed to launch disaster relief work in a timely manner. It is decided to give the punishment of recording a major demerit.

(Approved by the 52nd Plenary Meeting of the State Council on June 14, 1957)

　　中共中央和国务院严肃处理广西因灾饿死人事件
　　广西省委第一书记陈漫远和副省长郝中士萧一舟受到撤职处分
　　中共中央给有关党员干部处分的决定
    广西省于1956年发生了严重自然灾害。当时广西省委和有关地、县党委由于解放以来工作中获得一些成绩，农业社会主义改造又取得胜利，因而滋长了严重骄傲自满情绪，不深入地进行调查研究，不虚心听取下级干部的意见，以致对上述灾害的严重性估计不足。特别由于他们漠视人民群众的疾苦，放松党的政治思想工作，在灾荒发生的时候，没有能够及时地采取有力的措施，使灾荒的发展迅速制止，而造成平乐、荔浦、横县等地区农民大批逃荒和死亡的严重事件。此后，省委虽然根据中央指示，在救灾工作中有了改进，制止了1957年的春荒，但是没有能总结经验教训，教育干部认识错误的严重性，对于应该负有责任的有关干部，又长期不做严肃处理。这种严重地脱离人民群众，漠视人民生命的思想作风，不仅造成人民生命财产的重大损失，而且已经严重地影响党和政府在人民群众中的威信。为了严肃党的纪律，教育全党同志，中共中央在听了和讨论了中央监察委员会的检查报告以后，决定对于广西省委、平乐地委和平乐、荔浦、横县县委有关负责人分别给予如下处分：
    （一）中共广西省委第一书记陈漫远同志，因为该省的工作成就，严重地发展了骄傲自满情绪和官僚主义作风，忽视政治思想领导，从而影响到某些地区的领导干部也产生骄傲自满情绪，漠视群众疾苦，报喜不报忧。这种情况，使他对严重的自然灾害不加重视，没有及时地加强救灾工作的领导，终于造成群众大批逃荒和死亡的严重事件。决定给予撤销党内职务的处分。
    （二）中共广西省委书记郝中士同志，在发生灾荒期间代理省长（省长韦国清同志因公离职）。他由于关心群众疾苦不够，忽视灾情的严重性，因而没有积极采取有效措施，没有使省人民委员会有关部门和专署、县人民委员会作好救灾工作。决定给予撤销党内职务的处分。
    （三）中共广西省委书记萧一舟同志，负责领导财粮工作。他由于工作不深入，不了解下情，不认识灾情的严重性，因而没有领导有关部门及时作好救灾中粮食的供应工作，致使灾情严重化，决定给予撤销党内职务的处分。
    （四）中共平乐地委书记杨林同志，自恃工作中有过一些成绩，平素骄傲自满，对他所领导的地区的工作，盲目乐观，对严重的灾情，既不认真进行了解，又不相信下面干部的反映。在1956年3月以前，从未派人检查过灾情，并且在干部会议上批评反映减产和灾情的干部为“右倾”。因此使下面干部不敢报告灾荒真实情况。当灾情已经发展的时候，杨林同志也亲自向干部和灾民进行了调查，了解了一些饿死人和逃荒的严重情况，但是仍没有引起他对灾情的足够重视，错误地认为只是“部分地区，少数乡和个别户”的问题，因而就没有及时地向省委报告，对省委关于救灾的指示也没有贯彻执行。因此杨林同志对平乐地区因灾死人事件应负主要责任，决定给予撤销工作并留党察看一年处分。
    （五）中共平乐地委副书记何庶民同志，不重视该区有些地方因灾减产的情况，并且批评反映因灾减产的干部。当灾荒已经发生，恭城县的干部向他反映平乐的灾民逃到该县的情况时，仍不警惕，因而也就没有积极地采取有效措施，制止灾荒的发展。决定给予撤销地委副书记职务的处分。
    （六）中共平乐县委书记矫志周同志，批评压制报告减产、报告灾情的干部，发现饿死人的情况仍不采取有效措施，致使下面的干部拖延了粮食的供应和救济款的发放，对造成该县饿死人的严重情况，应负主要责任。决定给予撤销县委书记职务的处分。
    （七）中共荔浦县委书记王文陆同志，1955年向地委反映粮食减产受到杨林同志批评以后，不坚持党的原则，效法杨林，批评区乡干部，使区乡干部不敢报告灾荒真实情况。1956年灾荒出现后，又不重视，既不调查了解，设法解决，也不向上级报告。对于灾荒日益发展，造成严重后果，应负主要责任。决定给予撤销县委书记职务的处分。
    （八）中共荔浦县委副书记艾治国同志，在1955年粮食征购工作中犯有严重的强迫命令错误，1956年春荒发生后又对灾情采取不负责任态度。决定给予严重警告的处分。
    （九）中共横县县委书记薛秋水同志，在灾荒严重发展后，不但不积极领导该县作好救灾工作，反而对反映灾情的县区干部批评压制，并且令人追回县长何华锦签发向州地委的灾情报告。对该县饿死人的严重事件应负责任。决定给予留党察看一年的处分。
　　国务院给有关失职人员处分的决定
    国务院全体会议第五十二次会议听取了监察部对于广西省因灾造成农民大量逃荒死亡事件的报告，认为：广西省许多地区在1955年至1956年间发生了严重的自然灾害，由于省人民委员会和各有关地区的领导干部满足于几年来土地改革和农业合作化的胜利，产生了骄傲情绪，盲目乐观，放松了对于因灾减产应有的警惕，没有能够及时采取有力措施加强救灾工作，加以在1955年已经发生过农民逃荒和饿死的现象之后，仍然麻木不仁，不能从事实中吸取教训，以致在1956年造成平乐、荔浦、横县等地农民大批逃荒和饿死的严重情况。几年来，国家对于粮食统购统销政策的推行，保证了全国人民、包括灾区人民在内的粮食供应，对灾区人民克服困难渡过灾荒起了极大的作用。但是，广西省的领导干部由于在工作中严重地脱离群众，不了解下情，对灾情发展估计不足，因而没有领导有关部门正确地贯彻执行这一政策，及时地作好粮食调度供应工作，故没有能够制止灾情的扩大。
    在1955年救灾工作中发生严重缺点之后，国务院曾经指示：必须加强生产救灾工作，对某些情节严重的失职干部，应该予以严肃处理。广西省人民委员会虽然从1956年的下半年起已经纠正了救灾工作中的缺点，在1957年的春荒中也采取了有效的措施，但是对于因灾死人应该负有责任的县级以上干部，一直迟迟没有处理，因此不能在群众中分清是非，不能使干部得到教育。广西省人民委员会这种对人民生命安全漠不关心的作风和严重失职的行为，不仅造成了人民生命财产的损失，而且也严重地损害了人民政府在群众中的威信。国务院各部门和地方各级人民委员会应该从这次事件中取得深刻的教训，对于有关广大人民切身利益的问题，必须给以足够的关心；对于工作中已经开始暴露的错误，应该及时地深入检查，并且采取必要的措施进行纠正，以防止错误的扩大。
    为了严肃国家纪律，教育国家工作人员，国务院决定对于广西省人民委员会和平乐专署、荔浦县人民委员会有关负责人，分别给予处分如下：
    郝中士，广西省副省长，在韦国清省长因公离职期间，实际上代理省长职务。在灾荒中，没有抓紧救灾工作，严重失职，并且在事后检查的时候，企图推托责任，决定给予撤职处分。
    萧一舟，广西省副省长，负责财经粮食工作，对粮食减产情况估计不足，在救灾工作中未能及时做好粮食供应工作，决定给予撤职处分。
    陈漫远，广西省人民委员会委员、中共广西省委第一书记，由于严重失职，中共中央已经给予撤职处分，决定撤销其省人民委员会委员的职务。
    段书香，平乐专署副专员，负责掌握粮食工作，不重视灾情，对于救灾粮食供应工作不及时，决定给予撤职处分。
    李善本，荔浦县副县长，在1956年灾荒发生后，积压专署发下去的救灾指示达半月之久，没有及时展开救灾工作，决定给予记大过处分。
      （1957年6月14日国务院全体会议第五十二次会议通过）
