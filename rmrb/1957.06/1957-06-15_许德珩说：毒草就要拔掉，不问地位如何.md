　　Poisonous Weeds Must Be Uprooted, Regardless of Status
　　Last Saturday, our agency held a symposium. I spoke at the meeting, saying that we must stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and not lose our political direction, because this Party rectification is a major event in all of our political lives, and also a very serious ideological struggle. In the past week, all sectors of society have further refuted the fallacies of "opposing the socialist road," "opposing the leadership of the Communist Party," and "opposing the people's democratic regime," and have also exposed their conspiracies (such as the speech of Shi Liang, vice chairman of the China Democratic League, published in today's newspapers). However, this adverse current of rightists and anti-people evil winds has not been thoroughly corrected. As far as our Jiusan Society is concerned, especially Chu Anping's speech, although everyone criticized it in the last symposium, they did not point out the key point (Mr. Zhang Bojun said that some people said that Chu's speech hit the key point). Today, everyone's speeches criticized Chu Anping's absurd remarks. We must draw a clear line with all anti-socialist remarks, and believe that Chu's fallacy of "the Party's world" is a complete slander. His saying that "the Party's world is the root of all sectarianism, and the ultimate source of conflict between Party members and non-Party members" is an attempt to abolish the Party's leadership and the socialist system. As for the saying of "big monks and small monks," it is even more unserious. It is very good that comrades today can put forward correct criticisms, refute fallacies, and correct evil winds based on the spirit of loving the country, loving the Party, and loving socialism.
　　As everyone knows, without the leadership of the vanguard of the working class, the Chinese Communist Party, the socialist future of our country is unimaginable. At the same time, without socialism, there is no other way. Anyone here who is over thirty or forty years old and has sought a way out for this semi-colonial and semi-feudal China in the past will deeply feel this. Yesterday (June 13), the People's Daily published Mr. Cheng Qian's speech at the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang symposium, in which there was a passage that I think is very good. He said: When we meet here, we feel that we have quite a few followers, but once we leave the meeting place, go to factories and rural areas, we know that the scope we represent is actually limited. It is unimaginable for a political party representing a limited range of masses to lead all national affairs. We can take turns being the dealer in mahjong, but political leadership cannot be done this way. If we were to take the stage, would we have the ability to mobilize the masses to carry out land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, carry out agricultural collectivization, and carry out industrial construction? It is definitely impossible. ... The Communist Party represents the highest interests of the entire people, and the democratic parties only represent the interests of a part of the people. Which is bigger? Who leads whom? This is an objective existence and cannot be determined by any subjective will. Crying out for the abolition and weakening of the Communist Party's leadership, shouting for the Communists to 'get out of the sedan chair', wanting to kill the Communists, and taking advantage of the rectification to squeeze the Communists out of power are all subjective fantasies, which will run into a bloody nose in the face of objective reality. I fully agree with Mr. Cheng Qian's views on loving the country and loving the democratic parties, and I think that the comrades of our democratic parties, especially the comrades of the Jiusan Society, fully support them.
　　A very small number of people believe that launching criticism of fallacies during such a period of great blooming and contending will hinder the great blooming and contending. I say it will not, and it is also appropriate to carry out criticism in the process of blooming and contending. Rectification is for strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party and building socialism better. To offer opinions for rectification, but to attempt to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and negate the socialist road, is a fallacy that endangers the country. Can such a fallacy not be refuted? If fallacies are not refuted, well-intentioned criticisms will be confused, and well-intentioned criticisms will not be able to grow. This also shows that refuting fallacies is not "closing up," but to better "open up" and "open up" healthily.
　　Some people also think that this is the Communist Party's rectification, how can it rectify the democratic parties? If there are speeches during the rectification that endanger the national system, they are poisonous weeds. Poisonous weeds must be uprooted, regardless of their status. Communist Party members who make mistakes must be criticized and punished. Can people from democratic parties be an exception?
　　This rectification movement has given us a lot of political education. I hope that everyone will join this movement, raise their political consciousness, and "bloom" well and "contend" well.

### 许德珩说：毒草就要拔掉，不问地位如何

　　许德珩说：
　　毒草就要拔掉，不问地位如何
    上星期六本社举行座谈会，我曾在大会上发言，说我们要站稳立场，明辨是非，不要迷失了政治方向，因为这次党的整风是我们大家政治生活中一个极大的事件，也是一场极严肃的思想斗争。这一星期以来，社会各方面对“反对社会主义道路”，“反对共产党领导”，“反对人民民主政权”的谬论，虽然进一步的有所驳斥，对他们的阴谋也有所揭发（如今天各报登载民盟副主席史良的发言），但是这一股右派的逆流和反人民的歪风，还没有得到彻底的纠正。在我们九三学社来说，尤其是储安平的发言，上次座谈会中，大家虽然有所批评，但还没有指出要害（章伯钧先生说，有人说储的发言是打中了要害），今天大家的发言对储安平荒谬的言论作了批评。我们要和一切反社会主义言论划清界限，并认为：储的“党天下”的谬论是彻底的诬蔑。他所说的“党天下是一切宗派主义的根源，是党与非党矛盾最终所在，”是企图取消党的领导、取消社会主义制度。至于“大和尚小和尚”之说更是不严肃的。同志们今天对这些谬论，能够本着爱护国家、爱护党、爱护社会主义的精神，进一步地提出正确的批评，驳斥谬论纠正歪风，是很好的。
    大家知道，离开工人阶级先锋队中国共产党的领导，我们国家的社会主义前途是不可想像的，同时，离开社会主义，别的道路是没有的。在座的只要是三、四十岁以上的人，为过去这个半殖民地半封建的中国寻求过出路的人都是会深切感到的。昨天（6月13日）人民日报登载了程潜先生在民革座谈会上的发言，其中有这么一段话，我觉得很好。他说：我们在这里开会，觉得自己的群众蛮多，但是一出了会场，下工厂、去农村，就知道自己代表的范围究属有限，一个代表有限范围群众的政党要把全部国家事务领导起来，这是不可想像的事情。打麻将可以四人轮流做庄，政治领导断然不能如此。假若让我们登台，我们有没有本事发动群众来搞土改，搞三反、五反，搞抗美援朝，搞农业合作化，搞工业建设肯定是不行的。……共产党代表了全体人民最高的利益，各民主党派只代表一部分人民的利益，谁大谁小？谁领导谁？这是一个客观存在，不是什么主观意愿决定得了的。叫嚷取消和削弱共产党的领导，叫喊共产党人‘下轿’，要杀共产党人，趁整风之际要把共产党挤下台去，这都是主观的幻想，在客观实际面前，要碰得鼻青脸肿的。我完全同意程潜先生这些爱护国家爱护民主党派的意见，我想我们民主党派的同志，尤其是九三学社的同志们是完全拥护的。
    有很少数的人认为在这样大放大鸣期间，来展开对谬论的批评是否阻碍了大鸣大放？我说是不会的，并且在鸣放过程中来进行批评也是应当的。整风是为着加强共产党的领导，更好地建设社会主义。为整风提意见，却企图否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义道路，这是危害国家的谬论，这种谬论不驳斥行吗？不驳斥谬论，善意的批评就要被混淆起来，善意的批评就不能生长。这也就说明驳斥谬论不是“收”，而是要更好地“放”，健康地“放”。
    有人又以为这次是共产党整风，如何整到民主党派头上来了？整风发言之中有危害国家制度的就是毒草，毒草就要拔掉，不问它的地位如何，共产党人犯了错误要受批评，要受处罚，民主党派人士可以例外吗？
    这次整风运动，给我们的政治教育不少。希望大家投入这一运动，提高政治觉悟，好好地“鸣”，好好地“放”。
