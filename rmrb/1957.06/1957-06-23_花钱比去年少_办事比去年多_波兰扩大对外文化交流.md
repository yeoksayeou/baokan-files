　　Spending Less Money, Accomplishing More
    Poland Expands Foreign Cultural Exchanges
    (Our Correspondent in Warsaw, June 21) Poland's foreign cultural exchange activities for this year have been further expanded. The characteristic of this year is that it achieves both spending less money and expanding activities.
    The number of students sent abroad for study is greater than last year. This year, 382 students will be sent to 13 countries. The cost of sending these students amounts to a total of 264,000 rubles.
    This year, the foreign activities of literary and artistic groups have been very active. Activities already completed this year include: the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble and the Polish Theater visited Britain, the Teatr Narodowy visited Britain and the Netherlands, and a number of soloists and music conductors visited Belgium, France, Turkey, Finland, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. Major activities soon to take place include: the National Dance Ensemble will visit Yugoslavia, the Nowa Huta Theater and the Classical Dance Ensemble will go to Italy, a small song and dance ensemble will visit the Soviet Union, and the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble and the Silesian Song and Dance Ensemble will visit France.
    At the same time, many literary and artistic groups from Italy, West Germany, the United States, France, and those participating in the Moscow World Youth Festival will also visit Poland for performances.
    Significantly, although activities have expanded, due to the implementation of the policy of streamlining administration and reducing staff, the budget for foreign activities of the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art this year is only 60% of last year's budget.
    The above information was announced by the Polish Minister of Culture and Art, Kuryluk, at a press conference.

　　花钱比去年少　办事比去年多
    波兰扩大对外文化交流
    本报华沙21日电　波兰今年度的对外文化交流活动进一步扩大。今年的特点是：既做到少花钱，又做到扩大活动。
    出国留学生的派遣数大于去年，今年将派出三百八十二名学生到十三个国家去。派遣这些留学生的费用共计二十六万四千卢布。
    今年文艺团体的对外活动十分活跃。今年已经完成的活动有：玛佐夫舍歌舞团和波兰剧院访问了英国，热道夫斯基剧院访问了英国和荷兰，一批独唱家和音乐指挥访问了比、法、土、芬、意、西、瑞士。即将进行的主要活动有：国家舞蹈团将访问南斯拉夫、诺瓦·胡塔的剧院和古典舞蹈团要去意大利，小型歌舞团访苏，玛佐夫舍歌舞团和西里西亚歌舞团访法。
    同时，意大利、西德、美国、法国和参加莫斯科世界青年联欢节的许多文艺团体，也将到波兰作访问演出。
    有意义的是：虽然活动扩大，但是由于实行了精兵简政的方针，波兰文化艺术部今年对外活动的预算仅为去年预算的60％。
    上面这些内容是波兰文化艺术部部长库里卢克在一次记者招待会上宣布的。
