　　Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between Japan and China
　　Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party

　　Our Socialist Party made the following resolution at the January congress: We do not recognize the existence of two Chinas; Taiwan is a part of China and should be resolved as China's internal affair; Japan should restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as soon as possible. In order to realize this resolution, we organized a special committee for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and decided to launch a national movement.
　　In order to carry out the national movement to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, we believed that a goodwill delegation should be sent to the People's Republic of China for a visit. Therefore, we organized a delegation of goodwill envoys to China, led by Secretary-General Asanuma and including Katsumada, Sata, Sone, Hozumi, Yamahana, Narita, Sasaki, and others, which departed from Haneda Airport on April 10 to visit China. The delegation held talks with Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou Enlai, and many other leaders on the following issues: (1) Issues concerning the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and issues of common concern between Asia and the general international community; (2) Issues concerning the promotion of trade and economic exchange; (3) Issues concerning cultural exchange, etc., and issued a joint statement.
　　This event had a great impact on the Japanese people. Chairman Mao Zedong's meeting with the delegation, Premier Zhou Enlai's meeting with the delegation, and the joint statement issued by both sides were all placed on the front pages of Japanese newspapers, which played a great role in encouraging the Japanese people to fight for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
　　After the delegation returned to Japan, it immediately reported and requested the following to Prime Minister Kishi: The stage has arrived for negotiations between the Japanese and Chinese governments to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations; the Chinese government believes that meteorological agreements, postal service agreements, and fishery agreements can be changed to intergovernmental agreements, and trade agreements and cultural agreements can also be developed into intergovernmental agreements; and hopes to achieve the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible. Although the Conservative government admits that diplomatic relations will eventually be restored, it has not specifically expressed any enthusiasm.
　　After the Japan Socialist Party's goodwill delegation to China returned to Japan, it held report and speech meetings throughout Japan. The meetings were very enthusiastic everywhere and received strong support from national public opinion. Public opinion believes that the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China will definitely be realized. Promoting trade between Japan and China is also an urgent hope of all Japanese people.

　　推进日中两国邦交的恢复
    日本社会党书记长  浅沼稻次郎
    我们社会党曾在1月的大会上作出了如下的决议：不承认存在着两个中国，台湾是中国的一部分，应作为中国的内政问题加以解决；日本应尽快地同中华人民共和国恢复邦交。为了实现这个决议，我们组织了恢复日中邦交特别委员会，决定开展国民运动。
    为了开展促进日中恢复邦交的国民运动，我们认为应该派亲善使节团去中华人民共和国访问一次，于是组织了以浅沼书记长为团长、以胜间田、佐多、曾祢、穗积、山花、成田、佐佐木等人为团员的访华亲善使节团，于4月10日由羽田机场出发访问中国。使节团同毛主席、周恩来总理以及其他许多领导人就下列问题：（一）关于日中邦交正常化以及亚洲和一般国际间共同有关的问题；（二）关于促进贸易、经济交流问题；（三）关于文化交流问题等进行了会谈，并发表了共同声明。
    这件事给了日本人民以很大影响。毛泽东主席同使节团的会见，周恩来总理同使节团的会见，双方发表的共同声明等，在日本报纸上都被摆在头条地位，这对于鼓舞日本人民为恢复日中邦交而进行斗争，起了很大作用。
    使节团回到日本以后，立即向岸首相作了如下报告和要求：日中两国政府之间进行交涉以促进邦交正常化的阶段已经到来；中国政府认为气象协定、邮政业务协定、渔业协定可以改为政府间的协定，贸易协定、文化协定也有可以发展成为政府间的协定的可能；并且希望尽快地实现日中两国邦交的正常化。保守党政府虽然承认终究要恢复邦交，但没有具体地表示出任何积极性。
    日本社会党访华亲善使节团回国以后，在日本全国各地举行了报告、演说会。各地都开得非常热烈，得到了国民舆论的有力支持。舆论认为恢复日中邦交问题是一定能够实现的。促进日中贸易问题，也是日本全体人民的迫切的希望。
