　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. Major General Zheng Guolu, Chief Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, wrote a letter today to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, resolutely opposing the United Nations Command's attempt to sabotage the Armistice Agreement by transporting new weapons into South Korea.

　　The letter stated: At the 75th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on June 21st, the United Nations Command, disregarding the provisions of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement, stated that it would take unilateral action to transport new weapons into South Korea.

　　This behavior of the United Nations Command is a serious violation of the Armistice Agreement.

　　At this stage, the primary task in resolving the Korean issue is not to transport new weapons into Korea, but to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and transform the armistice into a solid peace, so as to immediately seek effective measures for the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea.

　　This is the proposition of the Korean-Chinese side, and the Korean-Chinese side strongly demands that this task be swiftly realized. We firmly oppose the United Nations Command's serious violation of the Armistice Agreement and its attempt to transport new weapons into South Korea. The Armistice Agreement was concluded and signed by both sides, therefore, neither party has the right to unilaterally change or abolish it. Such unilateral action by the United Nations Command is completely illegal and invalid.

　　If the United Nations Command does not comply with the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement and transports war materials into South Korea, it will be a completely illegal transportation, regardless of whether it is a gun or a bullet. The United Nations Command cannot legitimize this behavior with any excuse. The United Nations Command has an inescapable responsibility to abide by all the clauses of the Armistice Agreement.

　　The Korean-Chinese side continues to demand that the United Nations Command fulfill this responsibility.

　　坚决反对美方破坏朝鲜停战协定
    郑国禄少将写信给中立国监察委员会
    谴责美方把新式武器运进南朝鲜
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将，今天写信给中立国监察委员会，坚决反对联合国军方面企图破坏停战协定把新式武器运进南朝鲜的行为。
    这封信说：联合国军方面6月21日在军事停战委员会第七十五次会议上无视停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，表示要采取片面的行动，把新式武器运进南朝鲜。
    联合国军方面的这种行为是对于停战协定的严重违反。
    在现阶段，解决朝鲜问题的首要任务不是把新式武器运入朝鲜，而是要把一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，变停战为巩固的和平，这样来为朝鲜的和平统一的实现立即谋求有效的措施。
    这是朝中方面的主张，朝中方面强烈要求这个任务得到迅速的实现。我方坚决反对联合国军方面严重违反停战协定、企图向南朝鲜运进新式武器的行为。停战协定是由双方缔结签署的，因此，任何一方都没有权利片面地擅自加以变更或者废除。联合国军方面的这种片面的行为完全是非法的无效的。
    如果联合国军方面不遵守停战协定的有关规定而把作战物资运入南朝鲜的话，那就是完全的非法的运入，不管运入的是一枝枪或者是一颗子弹。联合国军方面用什么借口也不能把这种行为合法化。联合国军方面对于遵守停战协定的一切条款负有不可逃避的责任。
    朝中方面继续要求联合国军方面履行这个责任。
