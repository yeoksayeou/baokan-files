My Experience of a Month of Rectification

Liang Sicheng

The rectification campaign has been underway for a month, and the whole country has been mobilized. In just one month, the people of the whole country have been helping the Communist Party with rectification, exposing countless concrete facts of the "three evils." From newspapers and magazines, from the walls and blackboards of various institutions and schools, from the radio, from conversations in the streets and alleys, from all kinds of forums, from the "free forums" of many universities, what we see and hear is nothing but the Party's bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism—from the Central Committee of the Party down to the branch of any small unit, all exist more or less universally. “It's really a mess! The Chinese Communist Party is a party full of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. It is the embodiment of the ‘three evils!’” Many people get such an impression, and even draw such a conclusion. Some people say that they used to have illusions about the Communist Party, but now the illusions are shattered. Some people say that they used to have confidence in the Communist Party, but now the confidence has disappeared. Even some people who have applied to join the Party have declared that they want to withdraw their applications. They fall into a state of pessimism and disappointment. This kind of person is not a minority among senior intellectuals.

During the rectification campaign, many specific wrong facts were exposed, causing those who idealized the Party to be "surprised and disappointed," and those who were hostile to the Party to be "happy and pleased."

Indeed, for some people who idealized the Communist Party in the past, such exposures are surprising; for some people who have always been dissatisfied with the Communist Party, such exposures are just making them applaud. Indeed, in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, some people were wrongly struggled against; in the process of learning from the Soviet Union, deviations of dogmatism were committed; in the formulation of the Five-Year Plan, there was subjectivism of being too hasty and too high. All this, everyone admits are some mistakes made by the Party. As for the errors committed by individual Party members in their daily execution of tasks, and even in their personal lives, they are too numerous to mention. Many specific wrong facts have been exposed this time, so those who support the Party are surprised and disappointed, and those who are hostile to the Party are happy and pleased.

The Party's certain working methods or styles also made me feel confused, distressed, and silent, and I also have many dissatisfactions with the Party.

From my personal contact with the Party in my work, I have many, many dissatisfactions with the Party. The sufferings I have endured due to the Party's certain working methods or styles are really not small, making me feel confused, distressed, and silent. For example, the rough and ruthless treatment of cultural relic buildings in the process of urban reconstruction in Beijing made me extremely painful; tearing down a city tower is like digging out a piece of my flesh; peeling off the city bricks of the outer city is like peeling off a layer of my skin; the incomplete criticism of archaism, which led to a one-sided emphasis on economy, the large-scale construction of buildings that are neither suitable, nor economical despite being cheap, nor beautiful, and at the same time led to the transformation from one kind of formalism to another, from restoring the antiquity of China to restoring the antiquity of Europe, restoring the antiquity of Russia; in the process of urban planning in Beijing, kicking the "old" technical personnel aside, the Party taking over everything and monopolizing everything with closed-doorism... and so on. In the midst of calls for frugality, the Beijing Municipal Committee built that arrogant, large and impractical, extravagant and wasteful Municipal Committee building, which is restoring the antiquity of Europe inside and looks like a bathroom with the lining turned out, I also have strong opinions about it. I am especially dissatisfied with the Party's arbitrary and exclusive measures in many measures, and the use of violent storms to blow and soak people over many academic disagreements, making it impossible for people to breathe, let alone speak. Yes, I have many dissatisfactions with the Party.

I have never forgotten who led the 600 million people to liberate themselves. "Achievements are the main thing, shortcomings are secondary." This is not a slogan but a heartfelt and fair evaluation.

In the past eight years, I have always been arguing with the leading comrades of the Party, no matter which leading comrade. I have never bowed my head until I was truly and sincerely convinced. However, while stubbornly and continuously arguing with the Party, I have never forgotten: who led the 600 million people to liberate themselves, and fundamentally eradicated the oppression of imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capital on us for a hundred years; who led us to achieve the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, thereby simultaneously ensuring the three-year restoration of the national economy, and started the great construction of the first five-year plan; who led us to harness the Huaihe and Yellow Rivers, and built the Chengdu-Chongqing, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Baoji-Chengdu, Yingtan-Xiamen, Jining-Erlian, and Litang-Zhanjiang railways, making Karamay and Qaidam Basin spout oil, making the Yangtze River Bridge close two years ahead of schedule, and making the Sanmenxia project start; who led us to make our own cars and jet planes for the first time; who led the 500 million peasants, handicraftsmen, and capitalists to complete their "three major transformations" happily and with gongs and drums. I have never forgotten who helped me (and hundreds of thousands of intellectuals) understand who I am serving, and gave me strength and confidence. I can't forget even more that every time on "May Day" and "National Day" in front of Tiananmen Square, who made the faces of thousands of thousands of people full of confidence and pride smile; who made the tens of millions of red scarves across the country show such pleasant, happy, and lovely little faces! To use a formulaic phrase—but here it is not a formula but a fact, not a slogan but a heartfelt and fair evaluation—achievements are the main thing, shortcomings are secondary.

Many shortcomings have been exposed. It is not "very bad" but "very good," so that we can prescribe the right medicine.

The Chinese Communist Party is a party that "rejoices when it hears of its faults" and "does not hesitate to correct its faults"; it is a party that is "open-minded." Its shortcomings are "like the eclipse of the sun and moon." The Party knows that it has shortcomings, and has analyzed the "three evils." It does not cover up its shortcomings, but instead puts forward the policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"—and declares that it is a long-term policy. Now the people of the whole country and the democratic parties have begun to implement "supervision," and have spoken out for a month, and many, many shortcomings have been exposed. This is not "very bad," but "very good." Let us look back at the five thousand years of human history, have we ever seen any political party, whether it is in power or in opposition, and any government under the leadership of any party, that has such courage, such tolerance, such modesty, and such boundless and thorough trust in the people of the whole country, to mobilize the people of the whole country to give it opinions, find shortcomings, and carry out criticism? This is an unprecedented initiative in human history, and it is the most courageous and brilliant decision and measure of the Chinese Communist Party. The shortcomings have been exposed, and we can prescribe the right medicine, and these shortcomings will be corrected. In fact, many places have already been rectifying while correcting. This is the happiness of 600 million people. This is a great happy event that 600 million people should celebrate.

I have not lost hope in the Party or lost confidence. I believe that after the rectification, the Party will be younger, stronger, and more robust.

Wherever there is a government, an organization, or an institution, there may be bureaucracy; wherever there is a relationship between people (even between husband and wife), there will be each other, and there may be sectarianism; as long as it is a person, there must be his subjective components. The "three evils" exist everywhere in the world. There are seventy or eighty countries in the world, and if they have the courage to expose them, I believe that their "three evils" will be thousands and hundreds of times more than ours, although there is no way to count them, and there is no scale to measure them, I believe (if we can compare them), our "three evils" are not the least, but also one of the least. The rectification has begun, and many shortcomings of the Party have been exposed. I have not only not lost hope in the Party or lost confidence, but on the contrary, it has increased my confidence in the Party. I believe that by the end of the rectification, most of these shortcomings will be "rectified" away. After taking such a bath, all the dust and dirt on the body will be washed away, and the Party will be renewed. It will be younger, stronger, and more robust—and more lovable. It will lead the people of the whole country to build socialism with more determined steps.

I do not agree with abolishing the Party committees in universities. We need the leadership of the Party.

We must never negate the leadership of the Party. The leadership of the Party is unquestionable. I do not agree with abolishing the Party committees in universities (or other institutions and enterprises). We need the leadership of the Party. The question is how the Party leads. Some past methods of replacing the government with the Party or not separating the Party and the government are inappropriate. We should study how to further promote democracy so that the Party's leading role can be better and more correctly exerted.

This is a warm spring breeze, and it is the most timely "timely rain."

Let us continue to fully and freely speak out, nitpick at the Party, find fault with the Party, and help the Party "rectify" them away. Through unity—criticism—unity, our Party will be healthier, more consolidated, and stronger, and our political awareness will also be improved. The 600 million people will unite more closely. This is a warm spring breeze, and it is the most timely "timely rain." It will bring new life and greater happiness to our country and to the 600 million people. The exposure of shortcomings shows a bright future!

Just as the Party's shortcomings are being ruthlessly exposed, I want to say: The Chinese Communist Party is a great party! It is the most lovable party! I know you have shortcomings, and I am not afraid that you have shortcomings, and I will continue to expose your shortcomings as much as possible and ruthlessly, and I will also do my part to help you rectify them. I will add one last sentence: I will also dedicate everything I have to you!

    整风一个月的体会
    梁思成
    整风开始以来已经一个月，全国各地都动起来了。在仅仅一个月的期间，全国人民帮助共产党整风，揭发了无数三大主义的具体事实。从报章、杂志上，从各机关、学校的墙壁、黑板上，从广播中，从街头巷尾的谈话中，从各式各样的座谈会中，从许多高等学校的“自由论坛”上，所看到、所听到的，无非都是党的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义——从党中央一直到任何一个小单位的支部，无不或多或少地普遍存在。“真是一团糟！中国共产党就是一个充满了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的党。它就是‘三害’的化身！”有许多人就得到这样一个印象，乃至已经下了这样一个结论了。有人说从前对共产党存着幻想，现在幻想破灭了。有人说从前对共产党有信心，现在信心消失了。甚至有些已经申请入党的人也声明他要撤销申请了。他们陷入悲观、失望的境界中。这种人在高级知识分子中不占少数。
    整风中揭发出许多具体错误事实，把党理想化的人“吃惊失望”，敌视党的人“称快高兴”。
    的确，对于一些过去把共产党理想化的人，这样的揭发是令他们吃惊的；对于一些一向不满意于共产党的人，这样的揭发正好使他们拍手称快。的确，在“三反”、“五反”中，在镇反、肃反中，是有些人被斗错了的；在学习苏联的过程中，是犯了教条主义的偏差的；在五年计划的拟定中，是有偏急、偏高的主观主义的。这一切，谁都承认是党所犯的一些错误。至于个别党员在日常执行任务中，以至在私人生活作风中所犯的错误更是不胜枚举。许多具体的错误事实，这次都揭发出来了，所以令拥护党的人吃惊、失望，令敌视党的人称快、高兴。
    党的某种工作方法或作风也使我彷徨、苦闷、沉默，我对党也有很多不满。
    从我个人在工作中同党的接触来说，我对党不满的地方是很多很多的。由于党的某种工作方法或作风而令我吃的苦头也真不小，使我彷徨、苦闷、沉默。例如在北京城市改建过程中对于文物建筑的那样粗暴无情，使我无比痛苦；拆掉一座城楼像挖去我一块肉；剥去了外城的城砖像剥去我一层皮；对于批判复古主义的不彻底，因而导致了片面强调节约，大量建造了既不适用，虽然廉价但不经济，又不美观的建筑，同时导致了由一个形式主义转入另一个形式主义，由复中国之古转入复欧洲之古，复俄罗斯之古；在北京市的都市规划过程中，把“旧”技术人员一脚踢开，党自己揽过来包办一切的关门主义……等等。在节约声中，北京市委盖了那座不可一世的，大而无当的，铺张浪费的，里面是复欧洲之古的，外面像个把里子翻出来的洗澡间的市委大楼，我也很有意见。我尤其不满意党在许多措施中专断独行，对许多学术性的分歧意见用狂风暴雨来刮得人、淋得人连喘气都喘不出来，更不用说说话了。是的，我对党是有很多不满的。
    我从来没有忘记是谁领导六亿人民解放了自己。“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”这不是口头禅而是由衷的公平的评价。
    八年来，我对党的领导同志，不管是哪一位领导同志，总是争辩不休的。在我被说得真正地心悦诚服以前从来没有低过头。但是，在这样硬着头皮、继续不断地同党抬杠的同时，我从来没有忘记：是谁领导六亿人民解放了自己，从根底下铲除了百年来帝国主义、封建地主、官僚资本对我们的压迫；是谁领导我们取得了抗美援朝的伟大胜利，从而同时保障了国民经济的三年恢复，并开始了第一个五年计划的伟大建设；是谁领导我们根治淮河、黄河，修筑成渝、兰新、宝成、鹰厦、集二、黎湛等铁路，使克拉玛依、柴达木喷出石油，使长江大桥提前两年合拢，使三门峡工程开工；是谁领导我们第一次做出了自己的汽车和喷气式飞机；是谁领导五亿几千万的农民、手工业者和资本家欢天喜地、敲锣打鼓地完成了自己的“三大改造”。我从来没有忘记是谁帮助我（以及成千上万的知识分子）搞清楚了我到底为谁服务，给了我力量和信心。我更不能忘记每逢“五一”、“十一”的天安门前，是谁使千千万万张充满了自信和自豪的脸孔笑逐颜开；是谁使全国几千万条红领巾上面露出那样愉快、幸福、可爱的小脸蛋！套一句公式话——但在这里不是公式而是事实，不是口头禅而是由衷的、公平的评价——成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的。
    许多缺点都揭露出来了。不是“糟得很”而是“好得很”，可以对症下药了。
    中国共产党是一个“闻过则喜”，“过则勿惮改”的党；是一个“虚怀若谷”的党。它的缺点“如日月之蚀焉”。党知道自己有缺点，并且分析出了“三害”。它不护短，不掩饰自己的缺点，反而提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，“长期共存，互相监督”的方针——并且声明是一个长期的方针。现在全国人民、各民主党派已经实行“监督”起来，鸣放了一个月，许多许多缺点都揭发出来了。这不是“糟得很”，而是“好得很”。让我们回顾一下人类五千年的历史，可曾见过任何一个政党，不管它在朝在野，和在任何一个党领导下的政府，能有这样勇气，这样度量，这样虚心，并寄予全国人民这样无边彻底的信任，发动全国人民来给自己提意见，找缺点，进行批评？这是人类历史上的创举，是中国共产党最勇敢、最英明的决定和措施。缺点是揭发出来了，可以对症下药了，这些缺点就将得到改正。事实上，许多地方已经边整边改了。这是六亿人民的幸福。这是六亿人民所应额手称庆的大喜事。
    我丝毫没有对党失望，失去信心。我相信经过整风党将更年轻、健壮、坚强。
    凡是有政府、有组织、有机构的地方，就可能有官僚主义；凡是有人与人的关系（即使是夫妇之间）就有彼此，就可能有宗派主义；只要是一个人，就必然有他的主观成分。“三害”是世界上任何一个地方都有的。世界上七八十个国家，假使它们有勇气也来揭发一下，我相信它们的“三害”不知要比我们的多几千百倍，虽然没有法子统计，也没有尺度可衡量，我相信（如果能够摊出来比较一下的话），我们的“三害”不是最少的也是最少者之一。整风开始了，党的许多缺点揭发出来了，我不但丝毫没有对党失望，失去信心，相反地它增强了我对党的信心。我相信在整风结束的时候，这些缺点将绝大部分被“整”掉。洗这样一次澡，全身的尘垢洗掉了，党将焕然一新。它将更加年轻，健壮，坚强——更加可爱。它将以更坚定的步伐，领导全国人民建设社会主义。
      我不同意从高等学校中撤
  销党委，我们需要党的领导。
    我们绝不应否定党的领导。党的领导是无可置疑的。我不同意从高等学校（或其他机关企业）中撤销党委，我们需要党的领导。问题在于党怎样领导。过去有些以党代政或党政不分的办法是不妥当的。我们应该研究怎样进一步发扬民主，使党的领导作用能更好地、更正确地发挥起来。
    这是一阵送暖的春风，是一场最及时的“及时雨”。
    让我们继续大放大鸣，给党吹毛求疵，给党挑错儿、找岔儿，并且帮助党把它们“整”掉。经过团结——批评——团结，我们的党将更加健壮、巩固、坚强，我们的政治觉悟也将随着得到提高。六亿人民将更加亲密地团结起来。这是一阵送暖的春风，是一场最及时的“及时雨”。它将给我们的国家，给六亿人民带来新的生命，更大的幸福。缺点的揭发显示出来的是光芒万丈的前途！
    正当党的缺点被无情地揭发出来的时候，我却要说：中国共产党是一个伟大的党！是一个最可爱的党！我知道你有缺点，也不怕你有缺点，并且还要尽情地、无情地继续揭发你的缺点，也将尽我的一分力量帮助你整掉它。我最后还要加一句：我还要把我的一切献给你！
