(Report Compiled by Our Newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reports: Newspapers in various countries continue to comment on the Taipei incident, believing that the struggle of the Taiwanese people proves the bankruptcy of the "almighty US dollar" myth, and proves that the Chiang Kai-shek group has reached a "dead end." The Chinese people of Taiwan will one day drive out the American aggressors.

	A commentary published in Moscow's "Pravda" on May 31 stated that the Taiwan incident is an important stage in the struggle of people of all countries against American colonialists. In this incident, the angry Taiwanese people not only smashed American institutions in Taipei, but also destroyed the myth of the so-called omnipotence of the US dollar, that is, that a colonial empire could be built by relying on the US dollar.

	Prague's "Labor Daily" wrote on the 31st that the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan were a manifestation of the Taiwanese residents' anger at the entire US imperialist policy, and their anger at the fact that they had isolated Taiwan from mainland China and turned it into an American war base and the forefront of attacks on China. The newspaper said that the Taiwan incident clearly warns the US government that it needs to stop supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group and withdraw from Taiwan. If this is not done, one day, just as the Chinese people drove the Americans from the mainland, the Chinese people of Taiwan will drive them out of Taiwan.

	A commentary published by Albania's "Unity Daily" on the 30th pointed out that neither the American pirates' fleet, nor its aircraft and invading army, can ever subdue the Taiwanese people. "Unity Daily" emphasized that the powerful protests of the Taiwanese people against the aggressors have enormous power. It has crossed the borders of Taiwan and given a powerful blow to the American aggressors and American policies in Asia.

	Cambodia's "People's Daily" editorial on the 31st said that the Taipei incident exposed the true face of US imperialism, that is: unfair to mankind, hatred of peace, and that the so-called freedom of the American free world is only the freedom to kill with impunity. The editorial cheered for the Taiwanese people who have stood up. The editorial said that the Taipei incident clearly tells us that the Chinese people of Taiwan have full power to eliminate their own disasters.

	Singapore's Chinese newspaper "Nanyang Siang Pau" published an editorial on May 31 stating that since the anti-American demonstrations broke out in Taipei, "anti-American sentiment has spread to various countries in the Far East like the flu." In capitalist countries, "the more US aid a country receives, the more intense anti-American sentiment becomes" because US aid actually harms these countries.

	The newspaper also said that we have only seen US officials making a series of demands on Taiwan for apologies and compensation, but we have not heard any indication of preventing the US military from infringing on the sovereignty and human rights of the area where they are stationed. The editorial finally called for a retrial of the murderer Reynolds and the cancellation of the privileges of the US military stationed in Taiwan.

	The British right-wing "Spectator" weekly believes that the dissatisfaction that led to this incident was largely due to the recognition by the Chinese in Taiwan that the Taipei authorities are a "government in its dying days." The "Spectator" also pointed out that with the relaxation of the "embargo" on China, the United States' continued refusal to recognize China's status will be "further weakened."

	The left-wing "New Statesman and Nation" weekly said that the Chinese residents of Taiwan are opposed to the United States and "feel the attraction of the mainland."

    台湾人民摧毁了美元万能的神话  美国侵略者总有一天被赶出台湾
    各国报刊对台北反美示威同声称快
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：各国报刊继续就台北事件发表评论，认为台湾人民的斗争，证明了“美元万能”的神话的破产，证明了蒋介石集团已到了“日暮途穷”的境地，台湾的中国人民总有一天会把美国侵略者赶出去。
    莫斯科“真理报”5月31日发表的一篇评论说，台湾事件是各国人民反对美国殖民主义者的斗争中的一个重要阶段。在这次事件中，愤怒的台湾人民不仅捣毁了美国在台北的机构，而且也摧毁了所谓美元万能即依靠美元就可以建立它的殖民帝国的神话。
    布拉格“劳动报”31日写道，台湾反美示威是台湾居民对整个的美国帝国主义政策感到愤怒的表现，是对他们使台湾同中国大陆隔绝起来，并把它变成一个美国战争基地和进攻中国的最前线感到愤怒的表现。报纸说，台湾事件明显地警告美国政府需要停止支持蒋介石集团和撤出台湾。如果不做到这一点，总有一天就像中国人民把美国人从大陆上赶走一样，台湾中国人民会把他们赶出台湾。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”30日发表的评论指出，无论是美国海盗的舰队，无论是它的飞机和侵略军队，都永远不能使台湾人民屈服。“团结报”强调说，台湾人民反对侵略者的有力抗议具有巨大的力量。它已经越出了台湾的边界，给予亚洲的美国侵略者和美国政策以有力的打击。
    柬埔寨“人民报”31日社论说，台北事件暴露了美帝国主义的真面目，那就是：对人类不公平，仇恨和平，所谓美国自由世界的自由只是杀人可以无罪的自由。社论为台湾人民已经站立起来而欢呼。社论说，台北事件清楚地告诉我们，台湾的中国人民有充分的权力来消除他们自己的灾害。
    新加坡中文报纸“南洋商报”5月31日发表社论说，自从台北爆发反美示威之后，“反美情绪像流行性感冒一样，立即传播到远东各国”。在资本主义国家中，“接受美援越多的国家，反美情绪也越激烈”。因为美援在实际上使这些国家受到了损害。
    这家报纸还说，我们只见美国官方向台湾方面提出一连串的关于道歉和赔偿的要求，但是没有听说有甚么防止美军侵犯驻在地区的主权与人权的表示。社论最后要求重审凶手雷诺和取消驻台湾美军的特权。
    英国右翼的“旁观者”周刊认为，导致这次事件的不满情绪，大部分是由于台湾的中国人认识到台北当局是一个“日暮途穷的政府”所引起的。“旁观者”还指出，随着对华“禁运”的放宽，将使美国继续单独拒绝承认中国的地位“更进一步削弱”。
    左翼的“新政治家与民族”周刊说，台湾的中国居民反对美国，并且“感到大陆的吸引力”。
