Gu Zhizhong has the following opinion regarding the current ideological criticism:
    To oppose those who "speak badly out of good intentions" is morally unkind and politically extremely dangerous.
    Gu Zhizhong did not attend yesterday's symposium. In his written statement, he raised the following question regarding the recent criticism of anti-socialist remarks: "I hope that people who speak badly out of good intentions will not be implicated with those who speak badly out of bad intentions." He believes that it is dangerous to determine whether people are good or bad based solely on subjectivity. According to his analysis, the words spoken by people in general during this rectification movement can be roughly divided into four types, namely (1) speaking well out of good intentions, (2) speaking badly out of good intentions, (3) speaking well out of bad intentions, and (4) speaking badly out of bad intentions. Among these four types of people, he focused on describing the situation of those who speak badly out of good intentions. He said: In the past, because these people loved to speak and offer opinions, they inevitably suffered from the blows, squeezing out, sabotage, and neglect of sectarianists and bureaucrats in different situations. In today's rectification movement, many people have said many unpleasant bad things regardless of everything. Although these bad things are essentially good words and good medicine, they are often easily mistaken for bad things.
    He said: When we fight against the fourth type, namely those who speak badly out of bad intentions, we must avoid indiscriminately involving those who speak badly out of good intentions. Doing so is morally unkind and should not be done. Politically, it is helping bad people, isolating ourselves, weakening ourselves, and is extremely dangerous, and the wise Party will never do it.
    In Gu Zhizhong's view, the Chinese Communist Party's mass base was originally very good, but "today it has shown a slight shaking." He believes that it is necessary to "quickly stabilize it."

### 如果反对那些“好心说坏话”的人，在道德上非忠厚之道，在政治上最最危险。

　　顾执中对于当前思想批判有这种意见：
    如果反对那些“好心说坏话”的人，在道德上非忠厚之道，在政治上最最危险。
    顾执中没有出席昨天的座谈会。他在书面发言中，针对最近对反社会主义言论的批判提出这样一个问题：“希望不要把好心说坏话的人，牵涉到坏心说坏话的人里面去”。他认为单凭主观来决定人的好坏，是危险的。依照他的分析，在这次整风运动中一般人所讲的话，大约分四种，即（1）好心说好话，（2）好心说坏话，（3）坏心说好话，（4）坏心说坏话。在这四种人中，他着重描绘了好心说坏话的人的情况。他说：过去，这种人为了爱说话，爱提意见，不免在不同的场合中，遭受到宗派主义者与官僚主义者的打击，排挤，暗害与不重视。在今天的整风运动中，有不少人已不顾一切的说了许许多多的不好听的坏话，这种坏话虽然在实质上是好话是良药，但往往容易被误认为坏话。
    他说：当我们跟第四种即坏心说坏话的人进行斗争时，切忌皂白不分，把好心说坏话的人，也顺便的随意牵涉在内。这样做，在道德上，非忠厚之道，是不应该的。在政治上是助长坏人，孤立自己，削弱自己，是最最危险，而英明的党也决不会做的。
    在顾执中看来，中国共产党的群众基础原是非常好的，可是“到今天已呈现出微微的摇动”。他认为需要“赶快稳定下来”。
