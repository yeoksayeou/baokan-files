Xinhua News Agency, London, May 31st. The British government's decision to relax trade restrictions with China, defying the United States, has received widespread support here.

    Labor MP Silverman said today that this was "a return to sanity."

    The President of the National Union of Manufacturers, Garland, said that the government's decision was a realistic action that should have been taken long ago. It will open up a vast and profitable market for British exports.

    The secretary of the China-Britain Trade Committee of the London Chamber of Commerce said that the China-Britain Trade Committee, which played an important role in the movement to abolish this unreasonable trade discrimination restriction, will do its best to help promote increased exports to China.

    A spokesman for a group of traders engaged in trade with China said that the political significance of the government's decision lies in the fact that "after following the United States step by step for two years, we are now determined to act according to our own ideas."

    A porter, upon hearing the news, said: "Good news. The Americans will be uncomfortable."

    A spokesman for the British Board of Trade said that as a result of the revision of the trade ban on China, British exports to China are expected to reach an annual amount of 20 million pounds in the near future, which is twice the figure of last year.

    He said that the Paris Conference discussed some compromise proposals, but "no compromise proposal fully conformed to our basic position." He said that most countries at the conference supported the British opinion.

    The spokesman also mentioned that Britain expects that the United States will not retaliate under the "Battle Act," which stipulates the suspension of US aid to countries that violate the "strategic goods embargo." Some people in London also said in this regard that, in any case, Britain can only receive 30 to 40 million US dollars in US aid each year.

    The Board of Trade has announced the types of goods that can now be exported from the United Kingdom to China. These goods include: some machine tools; some electric motors and generators; rubber processing machines; most cars and tractors; most railway locomotives, railway vehicles and other railway equipment; most internal combustion engines; some scientific instruments; rubber and most tires; various chemicals.

    Goods that are still on the "embargo" list include certain types of heavy machine tools, certain power generation equipment, turbines, ball bearings and certain specifications of aluminum, as well as other goods.

    英国各界支持政府决定
    一个工人说：好消息，美国佬可要不舒服了。
    据新华社伦敦31日电　英国政府违背美国的意见作出的放宽对华贸易限制的决定，在这里获得了普遍的支持。
    工党议员锡尔弗曼今天说，这是“恢复了理智”。
    全国制造商联盟主席加兰说，政府采取这种决定是一种现实的行动，这种决定是早就应该采取的。它会为英国的出口贸易敞开广大而有利的市场。
    伦敦商会中英贸易委员会书记说，在要求废除这种不合理的贸易差别限制的运动中发挥了重要作用的中英贸易委员会，将要尽力帮助促进增加对华的出口。
    从事对华贸易的一批贸易界人士的发言人说，政府这种决定的政治意义在于“在亦步亦趋地追随美国两年之久以后，我们现在是决心按照自己的主张办事了。”
    有一个搬运工人在听到这个消息的时候说：“好消息。美国佬可要不舒服了。”
    英国贸易部发言人说，由于修改了对华贸易禁令，英国对中国出口不久可望达到年额两千万英镑，也就是相当于去年的数字的两倍。
    他说，巴黎会议讨论了一些折衷建议，可是“没有一种折衷建议是完全符合我们的基本主张的”。他说，会议中大多数国家是支持英国的意见的。
    发言人还谈到，英国预料美国不会根据“巴特尔法”进行报复，“巴特尔法”规定对违反“战略货物禁运”的国家停止美援。伦敦也有人就这一点说，无论如何，英国每年不过只能得到三、四千万美元的美援。
    贸易部宣布了现在可以从英国输往中国的货品种类。这些货品包括：一部分工作母机；一部分电气发动机和发电机；橡胶加工机；大部分汽车和拖拉机；大部分铁路机车，铁路车辆和其他铁路设备；大部分内燃机；一部分科学仪器；橡胶和大部分的车胎；各种化学品。
    目前仍然列在“禁运”货单上的货物中间包括某些种重型工作母机、某些发电设备、涡轮机、球轴承和某些规格的铝以及其他货物。
