Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 11th - A large number of pests that harm soybean seedlings have recently been found dead on the ground in 1,500 hectares of soybean fields in Yushu County, Jilin Province, attracting the attention of farmers and agricultural workers.

This is the result of using an effective insecticidal method jointly researched by the Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Jilin Provincial Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station. Based on the principle that 666 pesticide has a systemic effect (that is, after the seeds of crops are mixed with this drug, the seedlings that grow also contain the properties of this drug), they mixed soybean seeds with 20% 666 powder. After many experiments, it was proved that the soybean seedlings that grow have an insecticidal effect within thirty-four days after emergence. The drug not only has no effect on the germination of soybean seeds, but also promotes the growth of seedlings.

This seed mixing method is very simple, the ratio of seeds to drugs is 0.7 per thousand. The cost of medicine required per hectare of land is only more than 1.1 yuan.

Using 20% active ingredient 666 to mix seeds can not only 100% kill the main pests that harm the growth of soybean seedlings—soybean aphids and Oriental chafers, but also has the effect of killing Mongolian ash weevils, false ground beetles, flea beetles and all other pests that harm the growth of soybean seedlings. The agricultural leading departments of Jilin Province are preparing to promote it in the soybean producing areas of the province next year.

The Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute will cooperate with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to use atomic energy to explore the process of this toxicity transformation, so as to find the direction of new pesticides for preventing and controlling soybean seedling pests.

　　防治大豆害虫的新方法
　　用六六六粉拌种的豆苗，在出土后三十四天内有杀虫的效能
    新华社长春11日电　在吉林省榆树县一千五百公顷的豆田里，最近发现大量危害大豆苗的害虫僵死在地，引起了农民们和农业工作者的注意。
    这是东北农业科学研究所和吉林省综合农业试验站共同研究的一种有效的杀虫方法使用的结果。他们根据六六六药剂有内吸作用的原理（即作物的种籽拌了这种药物后，生出的苗也含有这种药的性能），用20％的六六六粉剂拌大豆种，经过多次试验，证明生出的豆苗在出土后三十四天内有杀虫的效能，药物不仅对豆种的发芽无任何影响，并且有促进幼苗生长的作用。
    这种拌种的方法很简单，种子同药物的比量为千分之七。每公顷地所需的药费只要一元一角多钱。
    用20％有效成分六六六拌种，不仅可以百分之百地杀死为害大豆苗期生长的主要害虫——大豆蚜虫和东方金龟?，对蒙古灰象鼻虫、伪步行虫、金花虫类及其他一切为害大豆苗期生育的害虫都有杀灭的效能。吉林省农业领导部门准备明年在全省大豆产区推广。
    东北农业科学研究所将同中国科学院合作，用原子能来探寻这种毒力转化的过程，从而找寻防治大豆苗期虫害新药剂的方向。
