Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Tokyo dispatch: Four representatives of the Ryukyu Legislature petitioned in Tokyo on June 4th, requesting the Japanese government to vigorously support local residents in opposing the US's forceful occupation of Okinawa Island land to expand military bases. They are the Secretary-General of Okinawa's Democratic Party, Chikazato Kaiei, the Chairman of the Democratic Party's Policy Research Committee, Hoshi Katsu, the Chairman of the Socialist Masses Party, Anri Sekichiyo, and independent, Shinzato Zenpuku.

According to Kyodo News, the United States has issued a new notice to forcibly occupy 155 acres of land in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Island, by paying fifteen to sixteen years of rent in one lump sum. According to this notice, the US military authorities in Okinawa will have the right to occupy the land regardless of whether the landowners are willing to accept the rent. If the landowners refuse to accept the rent, the US military authorities will deposit the rent in a Ryukyu bank.

This arrogant measure by the United States has been universally opposed by the local people. Of the 154 landowners directly involved, the vast majority have ignored the measure, with only four accepting the US notification.

According to Kyodo News, the US will forcibly implement this measure throughout the Ryukyu Islands.

The representatives of the Ryukyu Legislature requested that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi conduct strong negotiations with the United States when he visits the United States this month. Even if other more significant issues cannot be resolved, he should at least request that the United States agree not to forcibly requisition land.

These four representatives will stay in Tokyo for ten days. In addition to petitioning Nobusuke Kishi, they will also hand over the resolution on opposing the US military's forced requisition of land, made by the Okinawan people at the military land owners' conference on June 2, to the speakers of the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councillors.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Naha dispatch: The US Air Force authorities on Okinawa Island illegally revoked the right of Naha Mayor Kamejiro Senaga to issue permits to local farmers to enter the US Air Force base to farm on the 4th.

The Naha US Air Force base has occupied a large amount of farmland, some of which is allowed for farmers to continue to cultivate. In the past, the mayor of Naha had the right to issue permits to farmers to enter the base to farm. This time, Senaga prepared to issue permits to 511 people.

However, this time the permits were all rejected by the US military authorities. The US military authorities notified those who applied for permits that Senaga was a "communist" and the United States did not believe he was qualified to issue such permits.

Senaga is the Secretary-General of the People's Party and was elected mayor of Naha, the capital of Okinawa Island, at the end of last year. Because he opposes the US's militarization of Okinawa Island and demands the return of Okinawa to Japan, the United States has been trying to remove him from office.

    冲绳人民反对美军占地
    琉球立法院代表到东京请愿  美军当局无理侵犯那霸市长职权
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：四个琉球立法院的代表6月4日到东京请愿，要求日本政府大力支援当地居民，反对美国强占冲绳岛土地来扩充军事基地。他们是冲绳的民主党干事长亲里嘉英、民主党政务调查会会长星克、社会大众党委员长安里积千代和无党派人士新里善福。
    据共同社报道，美国已经发出新的通知，要以一次付清十五年到十六年租金的办法，强迫长期占用冲绳岛首府那坝的一百五十五英亩土地。根据这项通知，冲绳美军当局将不管土地所有者是否愿意接受这项租金，它都有权占用土地。土地所有者如果拒绝接受租金，美军当局便将这项租金存入琉球的银行里。
    美国的这一强横措施遭到当地人民的普遍反对。直接有关的一百五十四家土地所有者中，绝大部分都对这一措施不予理睬，只有四家接受了美方的通知。
    据共同社说，美方还将把这一措施在整个琉球群岛强迫推行。
    琉球立法院的代表们要求日本首相岸信介在本月访问美国的时候同美国进行强有力的交涉，即使对其它更重大的问题不能获得解决，至少应该要求美国同意不强迫征用土地。
    这四位代表将在东京停留十天，除向岸信介请愿外，还要把冲绳人民6月2日在军用土地所有者大会上所作的关于反对美军强征土地的决议交给日本参众两院的议长。
    新华社5日讯　那霸消息：冲绳岛美国空军当局4日非法取消了那霸市长濑长龟次郎发给当地农民进入美国空军基地去种田的许可证的权利。
    那霸美国空军基地圈占了大批的农田，其中有一部分允许农民继续耕种。在过去，那霸市长有权发给农民许可证，进入基地种田。这次，濑长准备发给五百十一个人许可证。
    但是，这次的许可证都被美军当局拒绝了。美军当局通知申请许可证的人说，濑长是“共产党员”，美国认为他没有资格签发这种许可证。
    濑长是人民党书记长，在去年年底当选冲绳岛首府那霸市长。因为他反对美国使冲绳岛军事基地化，并且要求把冲绳归还日本，所以美国一直想把他搞下台。
