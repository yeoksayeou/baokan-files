Improving the Import of Foreign Books and Periodicals
International Bookstore Invites Scientists to Symposium

(Our Newspaper's report) On May 23rd, the Import Department of the International Bookstore invited Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and Lu Shijia, representatives of the National People's Congress and renowned scientists, to a symposium to discuss several issues in the current work of importing foreign books and periodicals.

Regarding the question of whom the International Bookstore should serve, Zeng Zhaolun believed that the International Bookstore should mainly serve scientific research institutions and universities, followed by some factories and mines, and should also give appropriate consideration to individual scientists. He said that the current book ordering approval system should be changed. Principles should be established to determine which units can order imported foreign books and periodicals.

Qian Weichang believed that for a country as large as ours, importing 1.5 million pounds of science and technology books and periodicals per year is not much. Of course, foreign exchange should be saved, but the country should not haggle over the foreign exchange used to buy books. To save foreign exchange, a poorly ordered piece of machinery can waste an unknown amount of foreign exchange. The number of delegations going abroad could also be reduced, and the number of people in them should also be smaller.

Lu Shijia agreed with some of the views of Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang. She believed that foreign exchange should be saved, but this year’s budget of only 400,000 pounds for buying new books and 1958 periodicals is too little, and efforts should be made to increase it.

Regarding the system of importing and distributing foreign books and periodicals, Zeng Zhaolun believed that it could be considered to handle book and periodical imports in several large cities as well, appropriately dividing labor by domestic region or foreign bookseller, without having to concentrate everything in Beijing. Qian Weichang also agreed with this view. He also strongly disapproved of the International Bookstore handing over the distribution of foreign language books to Xinhua Bookstore. He said that this is dividing one thing into several stages. Now that it is divided into stages, readers are kicked back and forth between the two bookstores like a football. How can there not be many complaints? He advocated that the International Bookstore take on the entire job of importing and distributing foreign language books and periodicals.

The work of photocopying books and periodicals should also be valued. Qian Weichang said that photocopying work is closely related to import work, and the International Bookstore should not ignore it. The current photocopying work is unsatisfactory. He said that in the past few years when he was in charge of photocopying work, not only were books published quickly, but the prices were low and the binding was good. Now that there is a national professional publishing house, things have gotten worse instead, which is truly incomprehensible. He believed that all foreign books and periodicals needed in quantities of more than one hundred copies domestically should be photocopied. The current organization of photocopying work needs to be adjusted, its strength needs to be increased if it is insufficient, equipment needs to be imported if it is lacking, and technical employees need to be trained more intensively. This is not a waste, but a saving.

Qian Weichang also advocated retaining the current Expert Service Department in Beijing, and believed that one should also be established in Shanghai. However, the quality of the books in the Expert Service Department should be improved. Now it is enough to import only a few textbooks from universities in some capitalist countries; more is a waste. Talking about the Soviet books in the International Bookstore’s retail department, both Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang believed that there are now four too many and one too few. The four too many are: too many children's books, too many textbooks for primary and secondary schools, too many political books, and too many popular science books. The one too few is: too few advanced specialized science and technology books. They hoped to change this situation immediately. Qian Weichang also asked the International Bookstore to pay special attention to the import of international academic conference documents and patent documents from various countries, believing that this is extremely important for scientific research.

Lu Shijia believed that the units ordering back issues of periodicals should be limited. It is impossible for every new unit to import original back issues of periodicals from abroad. They should buy photocopied versions of periodicals domestically. However, it is not enough for our country to keep only one set of each back issue of periodicals. He believed that it is appropriate for each major regional center to keep a set.

Regarding the internal work and leadership of the International Bookstore, Qian Weichang and others believed that the bookstore's work has made progress in recent years. They hoped that the bookstore would connect more with the scientific community and seek the help of the scientific community. They believed that many professional societies and the 230 members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences can give the bookstore some help. Regarding the current problems of the bookstore, such as insufficient manpower, low cadre level, difficulties in housing and equipment, and insufficient attention from higher-level leaders, they are willing to appeal in the National People's Congress to urge the Ministry of Culture to pay attention to solving them.

### 改进外国书刊进口工作  国际书店邀请科学家举行座谈会

    改进外国书刊进口工作
    国际书店邀请科学家举行座谈会
    本报讯　5月23日国际书店进口部邀请全国人民代表大会代表、著名科学家曾昭抡、钱伟长和陆士嘉，座谈了当前外国书刊进口工作中的若干问题。
    关于国际书店应该为谁服务的问题，曾昭抡认为，国际书店服务的对象主要应该是科学研究机关和高等学校，其次是一些厂矿，也应该适当照顾到科学家个人。他说，现在的订书批准制度应该改变。哪些单位可以订进口外文书刊，应该定出一个原则。
    钱伟长认为，以我们国家之大，一年进口一百五十万英镑科技书刊不算多。外汇当然是要省的，但国家不应在买书的外汇上斤斤较量。节省外汇，一笔机器订得不好便不知浪费若干外汇，出国的代表团也可以少一些，人数也不要那么多。
    陆士嘉同意曾昭抡和钱伟长的一些看法。她认为，外汇要节省，但今年只用四十万镑买新书和1958年期刊是少了，要争取增加一些。
    关于外国书刊进口和发行的体制问题，曾昭抡认为可以考虑在几个大城市也办理书刊进口，按国内地区或国外书商适当分工，不必全部集中在北京。钱伟长也同意这个意见。他还很不赞成国际书店把外文书的发行工作划给新华书店。他说，这是把一桩事情分成几段来办。现在分段以后，读者给两个书店当作皮球踢来踢去，怎能意见不多？他主张国际书店把整个外文书刊的进口和发行工作担当起来。
    影印书刊工作也要重视。钱伟长说，影印工作同进口工作息息相关，国际书店不应不管。现在影印书刊工作不能令人满意。他说，前几年他在兼管影印工作，不但出书快，价格低，装订还好，现在有了国家的专业出版社，事情反而糟了，真是想不通。他认为国内需要在一百册以上的外国书刊都应影印。现在影印工作的组织要调整，力量不足要增强，设备不够要进口，技术员工不够要加紧培养。这不是浪费，而是节约。
    钱伟长还主张保留目前北京的专家服务部，并认为上海也应设立一个。但专家服务部书籍的质量要提高，现在看到有些资本主义国家的大学教科书进口几本就够了，多了是浪费。谈到国际书店门市部的苏联图书，曾昭抡和钱伟长都认为现在有四多一少，四多就是儿童读物多、中小学教科书多、政治书籍多、科学普及书多，一少就是高级的专门科技书少。他们希望立即改变这种状况。钱伟长还要求国际书店特别注意国际学术会议文献和各国专利文献的进口，认为这是对科学研究极关重要的。
    陆士嘉认为对过期期刊的订购单位应该有限制。每个新单位都要从外国进口原版过期期刊是不可能的，他们应该在国内买影印版的刊物。但过期期刊，我国每种保存一套是不够的，他认为，每个大区的中心都保存一套是合适的。
    关于国际书店的内部工作和领导问题，钱伟长等认为这几年书店的工作是有进步的。他们希望书店方面多同科学界联系，争取科学界的帮助。他们认为，许多专业学会和科学院的二百三十位学部委员都可以给书店一定的帮助。书店目前人力不足、干部水平低、房屋设备等困难和上级领导不够重视等问题，他们愿意在全国人民代表大会上呼吁，促请文化部注意解决。
