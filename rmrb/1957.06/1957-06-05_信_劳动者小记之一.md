    Letter
    — A Laborer's Notes, No. 1
    Wang Ming
    Outside the window, it's raining again. I think of Old Huang’s long shout, “Letter—!”; I think of the only rain-soaked story that Old Huang told me about himself; I have fallen in love with that story and Old Huang in that story.
    Outside it’s raining, and Old Huang is pushing his cart out right on time. He is very unhappy, because he just had an argument with a colleague at the post office. This rainy day seems to have added to his troubles. He rode his bike to the intersection of Dongdan Street and East Chang'an Street, and before him was a world of rain. He watched the traffic police standing in the middle of the street, waving his hands and calmly directing traffic. He looked east again, and under the eaves were some people sheltering from the rain. He recognized three of them. One of the young men among the three received about three letters a week. It seemed he wasn’t satisfied with that. As soon as he saw Old Huang, he would shout at the top of his lungs: “Hey—is there a letter for me?” Every time Old Huang heard him shout, he would grumble inwardly. This young man acted as if he couldn’t live without letters. Once, at the entrance of the alley, he couldn’t help but grab Old Huang's cart, insisting that Old Huang look through the mailbag to see if there was a letter for him. Old Huang shook his head, didn't say a word, just smiled foolishly.
    "Hey, comrade, why do you always act like you’re mute? Do you know how anxious I am?"
    "But if there's no letter for you, what can I do? If there is, I'll deliver it to you, don't worry." Old Huang's face was covered with a simple and honest smile as he looked at the impatient young man standing in front of him. He wanted to say a few more words to calm his emotions, but the words reached his lips, and they moved slightly, but he didn't know what to say, so he didn't say anything after all.
    Old Huang lowered his head, avoiding the young man; he knew that the young man would shout at the top of his lungs anywhere.
    The rain poured down endlessly, splashing on his face and blocking his vision. He made a sharp turn, and a car darted out of the alley, almost knocking him down, and the cyclist rode away quickly without even looking back. He was already unhappy, and this made him even more unhappy. He rode slower, and through the misty rain curtain in front of him, he saw a person standing at the entrance of number nine. For a month, every time he entered the alley, he always saw someone standing at the door of this house, either a young woman or an old lady. As soon as he passed number nine, the person standing at the door would quietly go inside. Could it be that the old lady was waiting for a letter from her son? Was the woman waiting for a letter from her husband? Maybe yes, maybe no. Arriving at number nine, he stopped, and said gently to the woman: "Registered mail. Stamp." And then he didn't say anything else. The woman looked at the envelope and ran into the house. "Mom, Mom, a letter has arrived." This joyful and excited shout was very ordinary to Old Huang. He stood under the eaves, his feet soaked in water, and the water dripping from the eaves tapped his rain hat, and then flowed down his neck and shoulders from the rain hat. His rubber shoes were already full of water, and as long as he moved his feet, water would gush out of the shoe tops. Old Huang wanted to smoke, maybe a cigarette would make him feel better, but the matches were wet from the rain, so he had to hold his hands together and lean on the handlebars.
    The old lady came out with the return receipt. The old lady originally intended to hand the receipt to the postman and be done with it, but she saw Old Huang standing in the water, getting rained on, waiting there blankly. The old lady felt bad, grabbed Old Huang's arm, and asked him to come into the house for a little while. Old Huang smiled and pointed to the mailbag, saying, "These recipients are all waiting." The old lady didn't let go, so Old Huang had no choice but to push the cart and follow her in with great reluctance. In a small living room, if the old lady hadn't repeatedly asked him to sit down, he probably would have stood there stiffly. The young woman poured a cup of tea. Old Huang, who had come in from the cold rain, felt that this cup of tea was so strong, so fragrant, and so hot. Just as he was about to take a sip, the old lady handed Old Huang a cigarette and struck a match for him. He realized that this family was so happy, and he felt a little annoyed. He realized that his mood was so incompatible with this family. After a while, a child of about six or seven years old ran out of the house. The child looked at Old Huang and didn't feel strange at all. The child got close to Old Huang and threw himself into Old Huang's arms. The child tilted his head, playing with Old Huang's brass buttons with his small hands, and looked at Old Huang with a sweet smile. "Uncle, Dad sent a letter." The young woman smiled. The old lady also smiled. He held the child's face in both hands, and he looked at the child's sweet smile and couldn't say a word, only feeling that his heart suddenly opened up, as if endless joy was湧 rising up. He seemed to realize for the first time that his ordinary postal worker's duty brought joy to this whole family, and it had completely infected him.
    "Hey, why should I be unhappy? What is there to be unhappy about? Life is so good, there are so many good people in life. Is it worth being so puzzled and inferior because of those two meaningless quarrels and those people who look down on my position?..."
    He got on his bike and quickly left the alley. He was on the street again. Before him was a world of rain, but what he saw seemed to be another scene: a female student ran quickly through the rain with a headscarf; an old man walked calmly in the rain with an umbrella; after a while, he saw three children sharing a raincoat, deliberately running through the deep water, laughing and making noise; in the distance, the New Qiao Hotel, the Youth Palace, the buildings on both sides of East Chang'an Street, and the lush green trees beside the sidewalk, bathing in the rainwater; how fresh, beautiful, and lovely these were in this heavy rain. He saw the young man sheltering from the rain again. Old Huang smiled, not intending to avoid him, and deliberately rode past him.
    "Hey—is there a letter for me?" The young man saw him at a glance.
    "Don't worry, there will be. It will be there in a couple of days." Old Huang replied loudly to him. The young man smiled.
    Old Huang pedaled hard, he wanted to whistle like the young man, but he couldn't, he tried very hard but couldn't make a sound; so he rode the bike quickly past the place with deep water with a "swish".

    信
    ——劳动者小记之一
    汪明
    窗外，又下起雨来了。我想起老黄的那一声长长的呼喊：“信——”；我想起老黄对我说过的那唯一属于他自己的雨中的故事来；我爱上了那故事和那故事里的老黄。
    外面正下着雨，老黄推着车子准时出去了。他很不愉快，为的是刚刚和一个邮局里的同事吵了两句。这雨天，似乎又给他增加了一些烦闷。他骑着车子到了东单大街和东长安街交岔路口，眼前是一片雨的世界。他看着站在街心挥动双手从容地指挥车辆的交通警。他又向东边看看，站在屋檐底下的是一些躲雨的人。其中有三个人他是认得的，三个人当中的一个小伙子，差不多一个星期就要接到三封信，看来他还不满足，只要一见到老黄，他总要破开嗓子嚷嚷：“哎——有没有我的信啊？”老黄一听到他的喊声，心里就要嘀咕一阵，这个年青人，好像离开了信就不能活下去似的。有一次，在胡同口，他竟然忍耐不住的一把抓住了老黄的车子，一定要老黄翻一翻信袋，看看有没有他的信，老黄摇摇头，没说一句话，只是傻傻地一笑。
    “你这个同志啊，怎么老像个哑吧呢？你知道我等得多么急！”
    “可是没有您的信，我怎么办呢？有了，我会给您送去的啊，放心吧。”老黄的脸上堆上一层憨厚的笑，看着站在他面前的这个急躁的年青人。他本想多说几句安定他的情绪的话，但是话一到嘴边，嘴唇微微一动，却又不知道怎么说才好，终于什么也没有说。
    老黄把头低下去，躲过那个年青人；要知道他在任何地方都会破开嗓子嚷嚷的。
    雨无止尽地泼落下来，扑在他的脸上，挡住了他的视线。他猛一拐弯，从胡同里窜出一辆车，差一点把他撞倒了，而那个骑车的人连头也不回一下就飞快地骑跑了。心里本来就不大痛快，这一来，更使他不痛快了。他骑得慢些了，透过眼前的这一层蒙蒙的雨帘，他看见九号的门口站着一个人。一个月以来，每当他进了胡同口，总看见这一家门口站着一个人，不是一个青年的女人就是一个老太太，他一走过九号，那站在门口的人也就悄悄地进去了。难道，那老人等待的是儿子的信？那女人等待的是丈夫的信？也许是，也许不是。到了九号，停下来，对着那女人轻轻地说：“挂号信。盖章。”便不再说什么了。那女人看了看信封，奔进屋里去了。“妈妈，妈妈，来信了。”这欢喜的激动的喊声，在老黄听来，已经很平常了。他站在屋檐底下，双脚泡在水里，从屋檐滴下来的水一滴接着一滴地敲打着他的雨帽，然后又从雨帽上顺着脖子、肩膀流下来。胶鞋里的水早灌满了，只要移动一下双脚，水就会从鞋筒里冒出来。老黄想抽烟，抽一枝烟也许会舒畅一些，但是火柴被雨水淋湿了，他只好拢着双手倚在车把上。
    老太太拿着回条出来了。老人家本来打算把回条交给邮递员就算了的，但是她看见老黄双脚站在水里，淋着雨，呆呆地等在那里，老人家过意不去，一把拉住了老黄，要请他到家里稍稍坐一下。老黄笑笑，指着邮包说：“这些收信人，都在等着呢。”老太太并没有因此就松开手，老黄没有办法，只好把车子一推，非常勉强地跟着进去了。在一间小小的客厅里，如果不是老太太再三说着请坐，他恐怕会一直僵立在那里的。那个年青的女人倒了一杯茶，从冷雨里走进来的老黄，感到这杯茶是这么浓这么香这么热，正打算喝一口，老太太给老黄递来一枝烟，并且顺手擦燃了火柴。他发觉这一家人是这么高兴，他有些懊恼了，他意识到了他的情绪和这一家人是这么的不相称。一会儿，从房子里跑出来一个大约六、七岁的孩子，孩子看着老黄，并不感觉陌生，靠近老黄，一头便栽到老黄的怀里去了。孩子歪着头，一双小手拨弄着老黄的铜纽扣，笑咪咪地看着老黄。“叔叔，爸爸来信了。”年青的女人笑了。老太太也笑了。他双手捧着孩子的脸，他看着孩子的甜甜的笑脸说不出一句话来，只感到心里突然间豁朗开来，好像涌起了无穷无尽的欢喜。他仿佛第一次意识到，由于他的平凡的邮递员的职责，给这全家带来的喜悦，已经完全感染着他了。
    “嗳，我为什么要不高兴呢？有什么值得我不高兴的呢？生活是这么好，生活里的好人是这么多，难道，为那两句无谓的争吵，为那些瞧不起我这个职位的人，就值得这么纳闷、自卑么？……”
  他迈上车，很快地出了胡同，他又到了大街上了。眼前是一片雨的世界，但他看到的好像又是另外一幅景象：一个女学生顶着一条头巾匆匆地从雨中跑过；一个老人打着伞在雨中从容地走着；一会儿，又看见三个孩子合顶着一件雨衣，故意从深水里嘻嘻哈哈地笑着闹着跑过去；远远的新侨饭店、青年宫、东长安街两边的大楼，人行道旁浴着雨水的翠绿的树丛，南来北往的车辆；这些，在这一片大雨中该有多么清新、美丽、可爱。他又看到躲雨的那个小伙子了，老黄笑笑，不打算回避他了，并且故意从他的眼前骑过。
    “哎——有没有我的信呵？”小伙子一眼看见了他。
    “甭急呵，会有的。过两天就有了。”老黄大声地回答了他。小伙子笑了。
    老黄用力蹬动脚蹬，他很想像年青人那样吹一吹口哨，但是他不会，费了很大的劲也吹不响；于是他把车子从那积着深水的地方“擦”地一声飞骑过去。
