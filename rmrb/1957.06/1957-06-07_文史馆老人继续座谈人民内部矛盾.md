    Elders of the Research Institute for Culture and History Continue Discussions on Contradictions Among the People

    (Our Dispatch) Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Research Institute for Culture and History of the State Council held another symposium on the issue of contradictions among the people in the CPPCC auditorium. Sixty-five researchers attended the meeting, and thirteen people spoke. They put forward many constructive suggestions on how to help the Party rectify its work style, on social life issues, and on how the Research Institute for Culture and History should carry out its work and study in the future.

    Pu Youwu said: Currently, the correct opinions put forward by all parties are being calmly considered and improved by Party members; however, some opinions are not entirely correct, and some are completely incorrect.

    In his speech, Pu Youwu said that since the start of the rectification movement, many non-Party members have put forward many sharp criticisms and constructive opinions to Party organizations and members, which shows the infinite trust and love of people of all classes for the Communist Party. He said that the Party's policies are completely correct, but because the socialist cause has no predecessors in China, it is inevitable to take some detours in implementation. However, the Communist Party can withstand tests and can readily accept good advice and dare to correct mistakes. Now, the correct opinions put forward by all parties are being patiently listened to and calmly considered by Party members; at the same time, they are paying attention to immediately improving what can be improved immediately. This demonstrates the fine style of the vanguard of the working class, which is worthy of attention and joy. However, some opinions are not entirely correct, and some are completely incorrect. For example, some people suggest that joint ventures should not have public representatives, schools should abolish the Party committee system, and even Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at the Renmin University of China, believes that the relationship between the Party and the masses is a hundred and eight thousand miles worse than before liberation, and that Party members act as plainclothes police. He said that such opinions, I am afraid, will not only fail to demolish the original wall, but will make it higher and higher, and the original ditch will not be filled, but will be dug deeper and deeper. He said that the rapid progress of construction in the new China in the past eight years is unimaginable without the correct leadership of the Party. In the rectification, Party members should treat opinions with the spirit of "the speaker is not guilty, the listener should take it as a warning, correct mistakes if there are any, and guard against them if there are none," while non-Party members should persuade the other party with an extremely serious and earnest, gentle and rainy, and well-intentioned attitude. Yan Youfu believes that although there is now a gentle breeze and drizzle, there are also storms, and even typhoons, such as Ge Peiqi's opinion, he said that saying such things has a very bad influence.

    Liu Fangyuan said: The State Council's leadership over the Research Institute for Culture and History is insufficient, and it does not care about the political treatment of cadres.

    Liu Fangyuan believes that there are now four types of people: one type believes that parents are never wrong, and the Communist Party is always right; one type uses the Party to pursue personal gain; the third type has concerns, has something to say in their hearts, but does not say it; and the fourth type has no chance to speak. He said that now newspapers only report good news and not bad news, and the People's Daily restricts speech. He said that rectification is not only a great happy event for the Communist Party, but also a great happy event for the people of the whole country, because it makes the people know that the Communist Party can also be criticized. He said that the news report on strengthening the work of people's letters and visits is even more significant than the rectification, because it is a regular way for the people to have the opportunity to speak. However, newspapers should instruct methods to teach people how to write letters and visits; they should also announce the results of handling letters and visits. Only in this way can we encourage the masses to put forward opinions. At the meeting, he also specifically raised the importance of Mr. Zeng Youxian's suggestion at the last symposium to re-formulate the national anthem. Liu Fangyuan also raised opinions on the State Council's insufficient leadership over the Research Institute for Culture and History and its lack of concern for their political treatment. He said that they cannot hear many important reports. The recording of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council meeting has been circulated to various organs, but it has not reached the Research Institute for Culture and History; the Research Institute for Culture and History cannot get a single ticket to watch the two major national ceremonies a year; and they do not have the learning materials that various organs can get. He demanded to change this situation.

    Specific suggestions for improving the work and study of the Research Institute for Culture and History

    Regarding the future work and study of the Research Institute for Culture and History, many participants put forward specific suggestions. Shi Zhongxiu, who spoke first, suggested that researchers can be organized according to their expertise and age to work in groups. Huang Lousheng suggested drafting a charter for everyone to follow in order to change the current situation of depression and laxity in the Research Institute for Culture and History. Song Gengyin suggested carrying out the work of reviewing and reprinting the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty. Shi Rongzhang suggested compiling the official history of the Qing Dynasty, the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and biographies of national heroes. Luo Jieli emphasized the importance of valuing and utilizing the living historical materials of the old gentlemen of the Research Institute for Culture and History. Wu Chengkan, Xing Zhanting, Chu Zhongyuan, and others also expressed their opinions at the meeting.

    At 3:00 PM, all the people who signed up to speak had finished speaking. Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, who presided over the meeting, gave a final speech. He expressed his gratitude to everyone for their enthusiastic speeches at the two meetings and for putting forward many valuable opinions. He also stated that after these opinions are sorted out, the opinions on the work of the relevant departments will be sent to the relevant departments for research and reference; those on the work of the Research Institute for Culture and History itself that can be handled and resolved immediately will be handled and resolved immediately, and the plan for improving the work will be studied and then handled.

### 文史馆老人继续座谈人民内部矛盾

    文史馆老人继续座谈人民内部矛盾
    本报讯　国务院文史研究馆馆员关于人民内部矛盾问题的座谈会，昨日下午二时半在政协礼堂继续举行。昨日有六十五位馆员出席了会议，十三人发了言。他们关于如何帮助党整风，关于社会生活问题，关于文史研究馆今后如何进行工作和学习的问题等等，都提出了不少建设性的意见。
    浦友梧说：现在各方面提出的正确意见，党员们正在冷静思考，动手改进；但也有些意见是不甚正确，甚至完全不正确的。
    浦友梧在发言中说，整风运动开始以来，许多党外人士对党组织和党员提出了不少尖锐的批评，也提出了不少建设性意见，这表明各阶层人民对共产党的无限信任和热爱。他说，党的政策是完全正确的，但由于社会主义事业在中国并无前人做过，所以在执行中免不了要走些弯路，但是共产党是经得起考验的，能够从善如流、勇于改过的。现在各方面提出来的正确的意见，党员们正在耐心倾听，冷静思考；同时也注意到立即能够改进的马上起来改进。这表现了工人阶级先锋队的优良作风，是令人重视和喜悦的。不过，也有些意见是不甚正确，甚至完全不正确的。如有人提议合营企业不要公方代表，学校取消党委制，更有如中国人民大学讲师葛佩琦认为，党群关系与解放前比差了十万八千里，党员起了便衣警察的作用。这样的意见，我看恐怕会使原有的一堵墙不但拆不掉，反而会越砌越高，原有的一条沟填不平，反而会越挖越深。他说，新中国八年来建设的突飞猛进的成绩，如果没有党的正确领导是不可想像的。在整风中党员方面应该以“言者无罪闻者足戒，有则改之无则加勉”的精神来对待意见，而党外人士也应该以极严肃认真，又和风细雨、与人为善治病救人的态度来说服对方。阎幼甫认为，现在虽然有和风细雨，但也有了狂风暴雨，甚至还有了台风，如葛佩琦那样的意见，他说，说那样的话影响很不好。
    刘放园说：国务院对文史馆的领导不够，对干部的政治待遇不关心。
    刘放园认为现在有四种人，一种认为天下无不是的父母，共产党都是对的；一种人是利用党来遂私图；第三种人有顾虑，心中有事，口里不说；第四种人是没有说话的机会。他说，现在报纸报喜不报忧，人民日报约束言论。他说，整风不但对共产党说来是大喜事，对全国人民说来也是大喜事，它使人民知道了共产党也是可以批评的。他说，报上登的加强人民来信来访工作，比整风的意义还大，因为它是经常的使人民有说话的机会。但报纸应该指示办法，教人民如何来信来访；还应该公布来信来访的处理结果。这样才能鼓励人民群众提意见。他在会上还特别提出上次座谈会上曾又馨老先生建议重新制定国歌的重要性。刘放园对于国务院对文史研究馆的领导不够，对他们的政治待遇不关心也提出了意见。他说，许多重要的报告他们都听不到，毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的录音，走遍了各机关，就是走不到文史研究馆；国家一年两次的大典，文史研究馆一张观礼券也得不到；各机关都能得到的学习材料，他们也没有。他要求改变这种情况。
    对改进文史馆的工作和学习的具体建议
    关于文史研究馆今后的工作和学习的问题，许多与会者提出了具体的建议。最先发言的石钟秀建议馆员可按照专长和年龄组织起来，分组工作，黄娄生建议拟订简章，大家遵行，以改变文史研究馆目前存在的消沉散漫的情况。宋庚荫建议进行审查重印清史稿的工作，石荣暲建议编修清代正史、太平天国史和民族英雄传等。罗介立强调了重视和发挥文史研究馆老先生们这份活史料的重要性。吴承侃、邢詹亭、楚中元等也在会上发表了自己的意见。
    下午三时，报名发言的人全部发言完毕。主持会议的国务院齐燕铭副秘书长最后发言，他对在两次会上大家踊跃发言，提出了不少宝贵意见表示感谢。他并表示将这些意见整理出来之后，有关各部门工作的意见，将送请各有关部门研究参考；有关文史研究馆本身工作的，能够立即处理和解决的就立即处理和解决，对于改进工作的方案，将研究后再作处理。
