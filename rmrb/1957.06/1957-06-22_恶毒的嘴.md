    Venomous Mouth
　　Tian Ma
    Recently, some strange criticisms have appeared in newspapers and periodicals. Mr. Zhang Yousong's "Record of Sealing My Mouth," published in the eleventh issue of this year's "Literary Gazette's" "Literary Tea House," is one example.
    At a symposium held by the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Zhang Yousong sternly criticized the work of the People's Literature Publishing House. The responsible comrade of the publishing house welcomed this criticism and began to pay attention to improving the work. It was decided to reprint two of Mr. Zhang's books, showing consideration for Mr. Zhang's "difficult situation of waiting for rice to cook," and advance royalties were paid once or twice. But how did Mr. Zhang see this? "Hmph, how dare you people launch sugar-coated bullets at an indestructible fortress! Beware of being bounced back and hitting your own vital parts!" Mr. Zhang's basis is that the publishing house did not take care of another translator as thoughtfully as they did for him. Thus, he concludes that the publishing house's care for him is to "seal his mouth," is "launching sugar-coated bullets," and therefore he "writes 'Record of Sealing My Mouth' with a smug air" to "cooperate with the rectification campaign."
    In my opinion, Mr. Zhang's "venomous mouth" is indeed venomous, and his cursing is truly consistent from beginning to end. Whether this attitude of "cooperating with the rectification campaign" is correct, please let the readers judge for themselves; I am thinking of another situation, if the publishing house had not shown consideration for Mr. Zhang's "difficult situation of waiting for rice to cook and given him care," how would the same Mr. Zhang have "smugly" written another "record"!

    恶毒的嘴
　　天马
    近来报刊上出现了一些奇怪的批评，张友松先生在今年第十一期“文艺报”的“文艺茶座”上发表的“封嘴记”就是一例。
    张友松先生在文化部召开的座谈会上厉言疾色地批评了人民文学出版社的工作，出版社的负责同志表示欢迎这个批评，并开始注意改进工作。决定重印张先生的两种书，体贴张先生“等米下锅的苦况”，一次两次地预支稿酬。而张先生对此怎样看呢，“哼，你们这些人胆敢向一座不可摧毁的堡垒放出糖衣炮弹，谨防被碰回去，打中你们自己的要害！”张先生的根据是，出版社对另一个译者没有像照顾他那样周到。于是得出结论，出版社之照顾他是“封嘴”，是“放糖衣炮弹”，因而他“怪得意地”写成“封嘴记”以“配合整风”。
    我看张先生“这张恶毒的嘴”也真够恶毒了，骂人也真够贯彻始终了。以这种态度“配合整风”是否正确，请读者自行鉴别；我倒是想到另外一种情况，假如出版社没有体贴张先生“等米下锅的苦况，给予照顾”，同一个张先生又将如何“怪得意地”写出另一个什么“记”来呢！
