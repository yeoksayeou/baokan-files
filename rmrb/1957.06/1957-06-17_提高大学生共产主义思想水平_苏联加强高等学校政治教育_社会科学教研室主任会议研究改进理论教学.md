To Improve the Communist Ideological Level of University Students
　　The Soviet Union Strengthens Political Education in Universities
　　Heads of Social Science Teaching and Research Sections Study Ways to Improve Theoretical Teaching
    Moscow, June 16 (Dispatch from this newspaper) – The All-Soviet Conference of Heads of Social Science Teaching and Research Sections in Higher Education Institutions opened on the 14th in the Great Kremlin Palace. Participants included the heads of teaching and research sections of Soviet Communist Party History, Philosophy, and Political Economy from various universities and advanced party schools, secretaries and ministers from the Party Central Committees and provincial committees of various republics, staff members from the Marx-Lenin Institute and the Academy of Sciences, and presidents and Party Committee secretaries from major universities, totaling more than 2,500 people.
    After Shepilov, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, announced the opening of the meeting, Konstantinov, the Minister of Propaganda and Agitation Department (responsible for the republics) of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, gave a report on the status and improvement methods of social science teaching in Soviet higher education institutions. He said that the task of teaching Marxist philosophy, political economy, and the history of the Soviet Communist Party in higher education institutions is to cultivate students with a Marxist worldview and communist ideology.
    He analyzed the teaching situation of Soviet Communist Party history, political economy, and philosophy. He pointed out that after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the teaching of Party history strengthened the connection with the practice of communist construction, widely cited materials from the activities of local Party organizations, and the enthusiasm of students participating in discussions increased. However, the level of teaching of Soviet Communist Party history in many higher education institutions is still very low, and many lectures are still superficial and dry. Some people, under the pretext of opposing Stalin's personality cult and its consequences, undermined the Party spirit principle of historical science. Some Party history lecturers have also forgotten Stalin's important works in defending Leninism. Because there are textbooks for political economy, the teaching level has improved, and propagandistic content has begun to decrease. Modern facts are widely cited during teaching, and the connection between teaching and research sections and production has been strengthened. However, there are many shortcomings, mainly detachment from reality, dogmatism, poor research on modern economics, and failure to use Marxist-Leninist methods to study new materials on the economic development of socialism and capitalism. It is also necessary to study many major issues, such as: the relative and absolute impoverishment of the proletariat in капитализм societies, the law of uneven economic and political development in капитализм countries, land nationalization, various forms of socialist ownership under socialist conditions, and contradictions in the development of the socialist economy. The teaching of Marxist-Leninist philosophy has also made some achievements recently. Philosophy is closer to life, and the struggle against bourgeois philosophy is more active. However, dogmatism has not disappeared everywhere, so it is often seen that teaching is divorced from the present. Many lecturers do not enrich themselves with knowledge of modern natural science, and philosophical research lags far behind the development of natural science. Lecturers have poor knowledge of modern bourgeois philosophy and sociology, so they hardly criticize them in their lectures. Common shortcomings in teaching philosophy and other social sciences are reading out clauses, without citing examples, and without debate.
    A discussion was held after the report. Chaigolov, director of the Political Economy Teaching and Research Section of Moscow University, proposed: to speed up the revision of political economy textbooks and improve the quality of doctoral and associate doctoral degrees. Fedorov, director of the Party History Teaching and Research Section of Leningrad University, proposed: to pay attention to the training of cadres and expand the connections between universities in various regions. Lora, director of the Political Economy Teaching and Research Section of Vilnius University, proposed: the Ministry of Higher Education should systematically inform lecturers of major domestic and international issues, and lecturers should have a good understanding of theories hostile to Marxism-Leninism. The meeting continued on the 15th.

　　提高大学生共产主义思想水平
　　苏联加强高等学校政治教育
　　社会科学教研室主任会议研究改进理论教学
    本报莫斯科16日电　全苏高等学校社会科学教研室主任会议14日在大克里姆林宫开幕。参加者有各个高等学校和高级党校的苏共党史、哲学、政治经济学的教研室主任，各个加盟共和国党中央和州委的书记和部长、马列学院和科学院的工作人员，较大的大学的校长和党委书记，共两千五百多人。
    苏共中央主席团候补委员谢皮洛夫宣布开会后，苏共中央宣传和鼓动部（负责加盟共和国的）部长康士坦丁诺夫作了关于苏联高等学校社会科学教学工作的状况和改进办法的报告。他说：在高等学校教授马克思主义哲学、政治经济学和苏共党史的任务，在于培养学生具有马克思主义世界观和共产主义思想。
    他分析了苏共党史、政治经济学、哲学的教授情况。他指出，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，教授党史时，加强了同共产主义建设实践的联系，广泛地引证各地党组织活动的材料，学生参加讨论会的积极性提高了。但是在许多高等学校的苏共党史教学工作水平还是很低，不少讲座仍然是肤浅枯燥。有人借口反对斯大林个人崇拜及其后果，破坏了历史科学的党性原则。某些党史讲师把斯大林保卫列宁主义的重要著作也遗忘了。政治经济学因为有教科书，所以教学水平提高了，宣传式的东西开始减少。教授时广泛地引证了现代事实，教研室与生产的联系加强了。但是缺点很多，主要的是离开实际，教条主义，对现代经济研究很差，不会运用马列主义方法来研究社会主义和资本主义经济发展的新材料。还必须研究许多重大问题，如像：在资本主义社会里无产阶级的相对和绝对贫困化，资本主义国家经济和政治发展的不平衡规律，土地国有化，在社会主义条件下社会主义所有制的各种形式，在社会主义经济的发展中的矛盾。马列主义哲学的讲授近来也有某些成就。哲学更接近生活，对资产阶级哲学的斗争比较活跃。但是教条主义还不是到处绝迹，因此时常可以看到讲授与现代脱节。许多讲师不以现代自然科学的知识丰富自己，而且哲学的研究工作大大落后于自然科学的发展。讲师们对现代资产阶级哲学和社会学知识很差，所以在讲演中差不多不批判它们。在讲授哲学和其他社会科学时常见的缺点是宣读条文，没有引证，没有辩论。
    报告后进行讨论。莫斯科大学政经教研室主任柴高洛夫提议：加快修订政治经济学教科书，提高博士和副博士的质量。列宁格勒大学党史教研室主任费多罗夫提议：注意培养干部，扩大各地大学之间的联系。维尔纽斯大学政经教研室主任洛拉提议：高教部要有系统地把国内外重大问题通告讲师，讲师们应该很好知道与马列主义敌对的理论。15日继续开会。
