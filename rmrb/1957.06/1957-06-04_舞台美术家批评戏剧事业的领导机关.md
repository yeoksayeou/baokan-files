    Stage Artists
    Criticize Leading Organs of the Drama Industry
    This newspaper reports: The China Theatre Association and the China Artists Association recently jointly held a "Forum for Stage Artists." Stage artists from various theaters, trade union system troupes, and the Central Academy of Drama in the capital attended. They unanimously agreed that serious bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism exist within the leadership organs of the drama industry—the Ministry of Culture, the China Theatre Association, the Cultural Department of the Military Commission, and the leadership of various theaters and troupes.

    Everyone first mentioned that the Ministry of Culture did not respect the opinions of stage artists when constructing theaters, allowing certain engineers to design subjectively, resulting in theaters that are both unsuitable and wasteful. They also do not value the working conditions of stage artists. There is not a single large scenery painting room in all of Beijing, and scenery is made outdoors year-round. The Central Academy of Drama only trains stage designers, and no one is responsible for training performance technicians.

    The leadership of various theaters also looks down on stage artists. The names of the designers are often not mentioned in newspapers when productions are premiered; when stage artists are hired, they are often not paid. The salary grades of stage designers and technicians are also the lowest. The Beijing People's Art Theater has a props expert with thirty years of service, whose grade is lower than that of actors with only three or two years of service.

    Many directors are extremely rude to stage artists, pretending to understand when they do not.

    Director Chen Qitong is a typical example of rudeness. He uses military ranks to lead artistic creation, often scolding people as stupid pigs and free-loaders. He said that when he joined the revolution, others were still in their mothers' wombs; he rarely discusses directorial intentions with artists, and after the design drawings are made, he scribbles on them with a pen. When the scenery is made according to his opinions, he finds it unsatisfactory, so he saws it up, knocking down the scenery and scolding: "Damn it, why isn't it made stronger?" Due to Chen Qitong's "changing orders," the artists of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe often work continuously for more than forty hours. Stage artists unanimously believe that rude directors are not just one or two. At the meeting, the artists of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe proposed that "whether it is cooperation or leadership, New China should treat us as human beings."

    Stage artists do not receive support in public opinion. Various magazines and newspapers often kick their articles around. "Drama News" rarely publishes articles on stage art, and even when it does, it is altered beyond recognition. This year, "Drama News" published an article by Wu Xue, who said that the level of directors, playwrights, and performers is higher than before liberation, but the level of stage art is not as good as before. Many artists raised counter-criticisms, but "Drama News" suppressed all the manuscripts. Therefore, they hope to publish a quarterly journal of stage art as a "forum" for debate.

    The leadership of many theaters gives artists random directions. Chen Qitong says one moment: "Your direction is stylization," and another moment: "Your direction is lightness and ease of use." But these leaders often don't even understand what "stylization" means. However, the director of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe asked the artists to make a model of a stone, weighing several hundred pounds, only one-third lighter than a real stone, which had to be transported by truck. Do stage artists consider this "light and easy to use"?

    Recently, a wave of "refinement" has been blowing among directors, resulting only in the "simplification" of stage art, with no artistic flavor at all.

    The trend of looking down on stage art has spread to drama academies. The leaders of the academies do not value the work of the stage art department, causing teachers to lose confidence and students to be uneasy and want to change careers.

    Due to time constraints, many comrades have not finished speaking, and everyone hopes to continue holding meetings.

### 舞台美术家批评戏剧事业的领导机关

    舞台美术家
    批评戏剧事业的领导机关
    本报讯　中国戏剧家协会和中国美术家协会，最近联合召开了“舞台美术家座谈会”，到会的有首都各剧院、工会系统的剧团及中央戏剧学院的舞台美术家们，一致认为戏剧事业的领导机关——文化部、剧协、军委文化部和各级剧院、团的领导上，存在着严重的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。
    大家首先提到文化部建筑剧场时不尊重舞台美术家的意见，任凭某些工程师主观设计，以致剧场既不合用，又造成浪费。对舞台美术家们的工作条件亦不重视，全北京找不到一个较大的画景室，一年四季，布景大都在露天制成。中央戏剧学院只培养舞台设计者，演出技术人员的培养无人负责。
    各剧院的领导也轻视舞台美术家，剧目公演时报纸上往往没有设计者的名字；聘请舞台美术家工作时，往往不给稿酬。舞台设计者和技工们的薪级也是最低的。北京人民艺术剧院有一个三十年工龄的道具专家，评的级比三两年工龄的演员还低。
    相当多的导演对舞台美术家极为粗暴，不懂装懂。
    导演陈其通是粗暴的典型，他以军衔命令来领导艺术创作，动辄骂人笨猪、吃白饭的，他说他参加革命时别人还在娘肚子里；很少和美术家谈导演意图，等设计图绘出以后，就拿钢笔在上面乱划，等到根据他的意见把布景做成，又嫌不好，于是拿锯子乱锯，把布景锯倒了，还骂：“妈的，为什么做得不结实？”由于陈其通的“朝令夕改”，使总政文工团的美术家经常连续工作到四十小时以上。舞台美术家们一致认为粗暴的导演并不只是一个两个。会上总政文工团的美术家们提出“合作也好，领导也好，新中国应把我们作一个人看”。
    舞台美术家在社会舆论上得不到支持。各杂志报刊经常把他们的文章踢来踢去。“戏剧报”上极少登载舞台美术的文章，即使登了也改得面目全非。今年“戏剧报”登载了吴雪的一篇文章，他说目前导演、剧作、表演的水平都比解放前高，只有舞台美术的水平不及以前。很多美术家提出了反批评，但“戏剧报”把所有的稿子都压下来了。因此他们希望能办一个舞台美术季刊来作为“争鸣”的园地。
    很多剧院的领导给美术家乱提方向。陈其通一会儿说：“你们的方向是风格化”，一会儿说：“你们的方向是轻便易行”。但是这些领导者往往自己也不懂什么叫“风格化”，但是总政文工团的导演要美术家做一块石头的模型，重几百斤，比真石头只轻三分之一，出门得用大卡车拉，舞台美术家说这也算“轻便易行”？
    最近在导演里又吹起了一片“洗练”之风，结果只是使舞台美术“简单化”而已，一点艺术气味也没有了。
    轻视舞台美术的风气已经吹到了戏剧学院里。学院的领导不重视舞台美术系的工作，以致使得教员没信心，同学不安心，想改行。
    因时间限制，许多同志还没有谈完，大家希望继续召开。
