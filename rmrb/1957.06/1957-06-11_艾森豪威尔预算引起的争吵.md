　　The Eisenhower Budget Dispute
　　Zhang Zhenya
    The US government and Congress have been arguing over the budget for nearly five months. Although the White House and Congress routinely make a noise and manipulate the US "democracy" on budget issues every year to deceive American voters, this year's differences have a more complex nature.
    First, the disagreement within the White House between the President and the Secretary of the Treasury has led to the resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey. Secondly, after the House of Representatives cut the budgets of various government departments, it disregarded the President's opposition and cut military spending by nearly $2.6 billion. The Senate also reversed its usual practice and further reduced some of the government departments' appropriations bills passed by the House of Representatives.
    Although, according to the American system, the above-mentioned reductions are not final, this situation has led the famous American political commentator Lippmann to say that "Eisenhower's political power is weakening." The British "Scotsman" also pointed out that "the US President is in a dilemma on the budget issue."
    Why did Eisenhower, who was overwhelmingly elected president last November, fall into a dilemma in just over six months, and why has his influence declined so rapidly?
    This situation is inseparable from the American people's opposition to the huge budget, the contradiction between the policy of strength and economic stability, and the internal disputes within the ruling group.
    People Oppose Huge Military Spending Budget
    It is easy to understand why the American people oppose the Eisenhower administration's huge budget. In 1950, the average tax burden per person in the United States was $367.79, which increased to $607.43 by 1956. With the sharp increase in taxes, the people's demand for tax cuts has been very strong in recent years. Eisenhower also made tax cut promises when he ran for president last year. However, after he came to power, he violated his promise and proposed an unprecedentedly huge budget for the United States in peacetime. This huge federal government budget, coupled with the ever-increasing expenditures of state and local governments, means that people will have to pay a total of $119 billion in taxes in the future fiscal year starting July 1 this year. This amount accounts for about one-third of the total national income. This is a record unprecedented in American history, even in wartime.
    Therefore, the new budget was met with fierce criticism from all sides as soon as it was proposed. Letters opposing the government's huge budget poured into the hands of congressmen like a tide. Recently, although President Eisenhower has repeatedly delivered television speeches to defend his budget and call for people's support, one in three letters received by the White House opposes the budget. Even the US Chamber of Commerce, which has always supported President Eisenhower, has asked the government to cut the budget.
    The strong pressure from the American people to cut the budget has forced some congressmen who have always tried hard to defend the President's budget to observe the situation recently. Therefore, some American newspapers predict that it would be lucky if the budget could be passed with a reduction of $2 billion.
    The Contradiction Between the Policy of Strength and Economic Stability
    Because the Eisenhower administration pursues a policy of strength, constantly expands its military strength, and establishes military bases and forms various military groups or alliances everywhere abroad, it has caused huge expenditures. Now it also wants to greatly develop missiles and nuclear weapons. In this way, in the future fiscal year, the cost of the three armed forces and the development of atomic weapons will increase to $41 billion (nearly 60% of the entire budget). If other related expenses are added, military expenses account for 63% of the total budget. In recent years, huge military expenditures and heavy taxes have brought serious inflationary threats to the US economy. This situation has caused unease among some people, including former President Hoover and resigned Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey. On March 6, Humphrey explained his opposition in a speech in Detroit. He said: "Even if weapons are important to American security, our country must also remain healthy economically. ...The billions of dollars spent on our military programs and troops have created great inflationary pressures. Although this money flows into the consumer sector, an equivalent amount of goods that people can buy is not manufactured... ." He believes that huge military spending will only exacerbate the inflation that is already developing, eventually leading to a "hair-raising depression."
    However, Humphrey's proposal was opposed by the Eisenhower-Dulles group's so-called "modern Republicanism" faction, which actively advocated external expansion. For the benefit of the largest monopoly capital groups in the United States, they used the excuse of "Soviet threat" to try to maintain huge military spending as much as possible, and at the same time tried to use some artificial methods to regulate economic activities and maintain unstable "prosperity."
    However, although the US President denied his Secretary of the Treasury's statement, the inflationary threat caused by huge military expenditures is a fact that even Eisenhower had to admit.
    In fact, the White House is racking its brains to find a way out of the current contradiction of maintaining a huge military machine and stabilizing the economy. According to Reston, a "New York Times" reporter familiar with the situation in Washington, some people within the White House who have state secrets are currently secretly studying a method to streamline the three armed forces and reduce duplication in military orders in order to strengthen the US military strength without increasing military spending too much.
    Whether this method will work is another matter. But the effort at least shows that the pressure huge military spending is putting on the US economy has become a problem Washington has to take seriously.
    Factional Struggles
    The split between Humphrey and Eisenhower, in addition to reflecting the differences of opinion within the US ruling group on military and financial policies, also reflects the contradictions between US monopoly capital groups with different interests. The current division between conservatives and the so-called "modern Republicanism" faction within the Republican Party is actually mainly a conflict of interests between Midwestern monopoly capital and large Eastern American financial groups.
    The Wall Street Consortium, which has huge interests abroad, especially the Rockefeller Oil Group, has always actively advocated external expansion, stepped up the implementation of arms expansion and war preparation policies, and expanded foreign aid programs; at the same time, it also advocated continuing to implement a so-called controlled inflation economic policy, and carried out a little so-called "New Deal" at home, using some small favors to ease the discontent of the masses. However, Midwestern consortia, which have fewer interests abroad, oppose excessive military alliances and base building abroad, and advocate reducing foreign aid funds and maintaining military spending within "safe" limits; at the same time, they oppose adding any social welfare measures.
    The struggle between factions representing different interest groups within the ruling party in the United States has a long history. After World War II, the Eastern consortia have always played a dominant role in American policy. This time, the representatives of the Midwestern consortia launched an offensive on the budget issue, nothing more than to take advantage of the predicament of American diplomacy, the people's war-weariness, and the Republican Party's dissatisfaction with the party's leadership caused by a series of failures in recent elections, in order to gain a more powerful voice for themselves.
    In the case of a split within the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, with an eye on next year's congressional elections, is also noisily attacking the Republican government's budget in order to cater to the psychology of the voters. Democratic Senators Byrd, Russell, and Johnson are criticizing Eisenhower's budget with such motivations.
    All of these are the complex factors that have contributed to the current dispute over the budget within the US ruling group.
    Disputes Reflect Increased Difficulties
    So, will the new budget really be significantly reduced by Congress?
    As mentioned above, the new budget was put forward in accordance with the policy requirements of the Wall Street Consortium, which currently controls the US government. The people's opposition has made it difficult for Congress to pass this budget, and the differences of opinion within the ruling group have further increased this difficulty, but neither the White House nor Congress has so far expressed opinions requiring fundamental revisions to the budget policy, nor has anyone criticized the basic principles of the policy of strength that created the huge expenditures. Moreover, both the Northern faction, which dominates the Democratic Party, and the "modern Republicanism" faction, which dominates the Republican Party, are working for Wall Street. Therefore, although the Democratic Party controls the majority of Congress, it is inconceivable that they will make fundamental revisions to Eisenhower's budget. Recently, Truman and Stevenson have hinted to Democratic congressmen that putting too much pressure on the Republican government on the budget issue will be detrimental to the Democratic Party itself. This is a sign that can explain the problem.
    However, the dispute surrounding the new budget shows that the US government's policy of arms expansion and war preparation is indeed facing increased difficulties.

　　艾森豪威尔预算引起的争吵
　　张振亚
    美国政府和国会内部在预算问题上已争吵了近五个月。尽管每年白宫和国会照例要在预算问题上鼓噪一番、玩弄一通美国的“民主”，欺哄一下美国的选民，但是今年的分歧却带有较为错综复杂的性质。
    首先是白宫内部总统和财政部长的意见分歧已经导致了财政部长汉弗莱的辞职。其次，众院在削减了政府各部门的经费以后，不顾总统的反对，又把军费削减了近二十六亿美元。参院也一反惯常的作法，对众院通过的一部分政府部门的经费法案作了进一步的削减。
    虽然按照美国的制度，上述削减还不是最后的定案，但是这种情况已经使得美国著名政论家李普曼说：“艾森豪威尔的政治权力正在削弱”。英国的“苏格兰人”报也指出，“美国总统在预算问题上已陷于进退两难的境地”。
    为什么在去年11月还以压倒优势当选总统的艾森豪威尔，才不过六个多月就陷入了进退两难的处境，而且他的影响也迅速降低呢？
    这种情况的发生是同美国人民对庞大预算的反对、实力政策和经济稳定两者之间的矛盾，以及统治集团内部的纷争分不开的。
    人民反对庞大军费预算
    美国人民反对艾森豪威尔政府的庞大预算是容易理解的。1950年美国平均每个人的赋税负担是三六七点七九美元，到1956年已增加为六○七点四三美元。在赋税激增的情况下，几年来人民减税的要求十分殷切。去年艾森豪威尔在竞选总统时也曾作过减税诺言。但是在他上台后却违反诺言，提出了美国和平时期空前庞大的预算。这个庞大的联邦政府预算，加上也在不断增大的州和地方政府的开支，就使得由今年7月1日起的未来财政年度内，人民须要一共缴纳高达一千一百九十亿美元的赋税。这个数目约占全部国民收入的三分之一。这是美国历史上甚至在战争时期也未曾有过的纪录。
    因此新预算一提出就遭到各方的猛烈抨击。反对政府庞大预算的信件像潮水一般涌到国会议员手中。最近艾森豪威尔总统虽然一再发表电视演说，为自己的预算进行辩护，呼吁人民的支持，但是白宫接到的每三封信中就有一封反对预算。连一向支持艾森豪威尔总统的美国商会也要求政府削减预算。
    美国人民要求削减预算的强大压力，使国会中一向大卖气力卫护总统预算的一些议员最近也不得不观观风色。因此有些美国报刊预测，预算能够在削减二十亿美元的情况下通过，就算幸运了。
    实力政策和经济稳定的矛盾
    艾森豪威尔政府由于推行实力政策，不断扩充军事实力并在国外到处建立军事基地，成立各种军事集团或同盟，因此造成浩大的开支。现在它又要大事发展导弹和核子武器。这样，在未来财政年度内，就使三军费用和原子能武器的发展费用增加到四百一十亿美元（将近占了整个预算的60％）。如果加上其他有关开支，军事性费用共占预算总额的63％。庞大的军事开支和沉重的赋税几年来为美国经济带来严重的通货膨胀威胁。这种状况已经引起了一些人的不安，其中包括前总统胡佛和已辞职的财政部长汉弗莱。3月6日汉弗莱在底特律市讲话时曾说明了他的反对意见。他说：“即使武器对美国安全重要，但是我国在经济上也必须保持健康。……我国的军事项目和部队人员用掉的数以十亿计的钱产生了很大的通货膨胀的压力。虽然这些钱流入了消费领域，但是却没有同等数量的、为人民所能购买的物品制造出来……。”他认为：庞大的军费只会加重已经在发展的通货膨胀，最后导致“令人毛发悚然的萧条”。
    但是汉弗莱的主张却遭到艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯集团的积极主张向外扩张的所谓“现代共和主义”派的反对。为了美国最大的垄断资本集团的利益，他们借口“苏联的威胁”，力图尽可能保持庞大的军费，同时企图用一些人工的办法来调节经济活动，维持不稳定的“繁荣”。
    不过，尽管美国总统否定他的财政部长的说法，但是庞大的军事费用所造成的通货膨胀威胁却是一件连艾森豪威尔也不得不承认的事实。
    实际上白宫内部正在挖空心思地寻找出路，来摆脱目前既要维持庞大军事机器又要稳定经济的矛盾。根据熟悉华盛顿情况的“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿透露：白宫内部一些掌握国家机密的人目前已在暗中研究一项精简三军机构和减少在军事定货上的重复现象的办法，以求在不致太多地增加军费的情况下加强美国的军事实力。
    这种办法是否行得通是另外一个问题。但是这方面的努力至少说明，庞大的军费对美国经济所造成的压力，已经成为一个使华盛顿不得不加以认真考虑的难题了。
    派系之间的斗争
    汉弗莱和艾森豪威尔的分裂，除掉反映美国统治集团内部在军事和财政政策上的意见分歧以外，还反映了美国利益不同的垄断资本集团之间的矛盾。目前共和党内部保守派和所谓“现代共和主义”派之间的分野，实际上主要是中西部垄断资本和美国东部大财团之间的利益冲突。
    在国外拥有雄厚利益的华尔街财团，特别是洛克菲勒石油集团，一直积极主张向外扩张，加紧推行扩军备战的政策，扩大援外计划；同时也主张继续执行一种所谓有控制的通货膨胀的经济政策，在国内搞一点所谓“新政”，用些小惠来缓和群众的不满。但是在国外利益较小的中西部财团却反对在国外过多地缔结军事同盟、建立基地，而主张减少援外用款，并把军费维持在“安全”限度以内；同时反对增添任何社会福利措施。
    美国统治政党内部代表不同利益财团的派别的斗争由来已久。第二次大战后，东部财团在美国政策上始终起着支配的作用。这一次中西部财团的代表们在预算问题上发动攻势，无非是想利用美国外交上的困境，人民的厌战心理和共和党内部因在最近选举中的一连串失败而引起的对党的领导的不满，来为自己取得较为有力的发言地位。
    在共和党内部发生分裂的情况下，民主党着眼于明年的国会选举，为了迎合选民心理，也吵吵嚷嚷地对共和党政府的预算进行攻击。民主党参议员伯德、鲁塞尔和约翰逊等人就是怀着这样的动机来批评艾森豪威尔的预算的。
    所有这些都是促成目前美国统治集团内部在预算问题上争吵的复杂因素。
    争吵反映了困难增加
    那么新预算是否真会遭到国会的大量削减呢？
    上面说过，新预算是按照目前控制着美国政府的华尔街财团的政策要求提出来的。人民的反对固然使得国会在通过这个预算时，煞费手脚，统治集团内部意见的分歧更增加了这种困难，但是无论是白宫，或是国会内，迄今还没有要求根本修改预算政策的意见，也还没有人批评造成庞大开支的实力政策的基本原则。而且，无论是民主党中占优势的北方派和共和党中占统治地位的“现代共和主义”派都在为华尔街效力。因此，虽然民主党控制着国会的多数，却不能设想他们会对艾森豪威尔的预算作根本的修改。最近杜鲁门和史蒂文森已在向民主党议员暗示：在预算问题上对共和党政府施加压力太过，将会对民主党自身不利。这就是一个能够说明问题的迹象。
    不过，围绕着新预算进行的争吵毕竟说明，美国政府推行的扩军备战政策困难是增加了。
