(Our newspaper's dispatch from Bengbu, June 4th) The Huaihe River plain in northern Anhui Province and both banks of the Huai River have entered a season of intense wheat harvesting. The question people are concerned about now is, if the Huai River flood peak arrives early as it did last year, can the Huai River embankments guarantee that the wheat will not be flooded? The person in charge of the flood control department of the Huai River Harnessing Committee told reporters that the embankments of the main stream and major tributaries of the Huai River in the middle reaches of Anhui Province have greatly improved their flood control capacity through continuous repair and reinforcement. The embankment reinforcement project from last winter to this spring was basically completed before the end of May. The dikes on the north bank of the Huai River below the Yinghe River estuary and the dikes in the sections of Bengbu, Huainan, and the Huainan mining area on the south bank of the Huai River have all been heightened. In this way, even if encountering extraordinary floods like those of 1954 and 1956, it is possible to ensure that the Huaihe River plain and both banks of the Huai River will not be breached and suffer disaster, and normal transportation on the Jinpu Railway can be maintained. If a flood exceeding the 1954 type occurs, efforts can also be made to mitigate the disaster.

The flood control department has also transported flood control materials to dangerous sections for storage and backup. At the same time, it has also investigated and registered the flood control materials stored by various special districts, cities, and enterprise departments along the Huai River, and will allocate and use them at any time depending on the rising water level during the flood season.

During this period, the flood control teams in various counties and townships have organized their forces, and can go to the dikes for flood control in a planned manner according to the development of the flood situation.

    堤防防洪能力大大提高
    淮河两岸今年麦收有了保障
    本报蚌埠4日电　安徽省淮北平原和淮河两岸已进入紧张的麦收季节。现在人们关心的问题是，要是像去年那样，淮河洪峰提前来到，淮河堤防能否保证小麦不致受淹？治淮委员会防汛部门的负责人告诉记者，安徽省淮河中游干流和主要支流的堤防，经过不断整修加固，已大大提高了防洪能力。去冬今春的复堤加固工程已于5月底前基本上完成。颍河口以下的淮河北岸大堤和淮河南岸的蚌埠、淮南两市及淮南矿区的堤段都加高了堤身。这样，即使遇到1954和1956年那样的特大洪水，也可能保证淮北平原和淮河两岸不致溃决成灾，并能照常维持津浦铁路的交通运输。倘使出现超过1954年型的洪水，也可以争取减轻灾害。
    防汛部门也已将防汛器材运往险要工段存储备用，同时对沿淮各专区、市和企业部门所存的防汛器材也作了调查登记，看汛期水势上涨的情况随时调拨使用。
    在这个期间，各县、乡的防汛队都已组织好了力量，可以作到按汛情发展有计划地上堤防汛。
