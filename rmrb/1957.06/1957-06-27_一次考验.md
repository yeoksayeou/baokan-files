　　A Test
　　Xu Bangyi
    Zhou Ying, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), made a speech at an enlarged meeting of the RCCK Central Small Group on June 5. According to a report in the People's Daily, she said: In previous movements, Communist Party members were the ones who charged forward, so why are Communist Party members now "sitting tight and waiting"? At this meeting, she demanded that Communist Party members "immediately step forward." Furthermore, she believed that some major issues within the Communist Party were locked in a "safe," and that responsible cadres of the Party must come forward to expose these issues, and that they must be attacked from both inside and outside the Party in order to break through.
    This passage of her speech is indeed worthy of our Communist Party members thinking about: What issue is she talking about? What is her intention? After thinking about it, I believe that her speech fully demonstrates the frenzy of the rightists' attack on the Party. She is so arrogant as to want to incite Communist Party members and rightists to attack the Party together, probably to launch a joint offensive, with internal and external coordination, in order to overthrow the Party. She actually brazenly interferes in the affairs of the Communist Party and demands that responsible cadres of the Party expose internal secrets. Lu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News, also wants "Party members and League members to revolt during the rectification." Their mutual calls and collaboration show how malicious their intentions are! From this, it can be seen that the rightists are carrying out a comprehensive attack on the Party: from politics, ideology to organization. They have a set of programs, strategies, and tactics in their attack.
    Indeed, the attack of the rightists is a test for Communist Party members. Now it seems that the vast majority of Communist Party members can withstand the test and are loyal to the Party. The rightists' attempt to incite "dissatisfaction" within the Party is powerless. That is the wishful thinking of the rightists! Thus, for these steadfast Communist Party members, the rightists scold them as "factionalists," "shameless," and "lacking conscience," and so on. Can Communist Party members be defeated and intimidated by being scolded? That's just wishful thinking! Communist Party members live and grow in struggle. They will only become stronger through struggle, and they know how to deal with those who are hostile to the Communist Party. Of course, we do not deny that in this attack by the rightists, there are a few wavering elements within our Party. They cannot withstand the test, and they waver and lose their direction when they encounter storms. Some people have joined forces with the rightists to form a "chorus," or, as Zhou Ying and Lu Yi hoped, "immediately step forward" to charge and "revolt." These are "Communist Party members" in parentheses. The rightists call them "revolting elements" and "people with conscience." Naturally, it is not surprising that a few such rebellious elements appear within the Party. We know that class struggle in society is always reflected in the Party. Whenever the wheels of history move forward rapidly, some people will always be thrown off.
    From the speeches of people like Zhou Ying and Lu Yi, we deeply feel how important it is for a Communist Party member to firmly stand on the Party's position and maintain the purity of their thinking! Shouldn't we be even more vigilant against those who have revisionist ideas (denying the Party's leadership, denying democratic centralism, denying the Party's discipline, denying Party spirit and class character, etc.)? How many ambitious people want to exploit the loopholes in the Party and take advantage of Communist Party members! Although Zhou Ying's speech emitted poisonous gas, it has educational significance. Therefore, it is worth writing about.

　　一次考验
　　许邦仪
    民革中央委员周颖在6月5日民革中央小组扩大会议上有一个发言。根据人民日报的报导，她说：过去历次运动中都是共产党员打冲锋，现在共产党员为什么“坐阵以待”？她在这次会议上提出要求共产党员“立即出马”。并且她还认为，共产党内有些重大问题被锁在“保险柜”内，这些问题必须党的负责干部出来揭发，必须党内外夹攻才能攻得出来。
    她这段发言确实是值得我们共产党员用脑子想一想：她讲的是什么问题？她的用意何在？我想了一想，她的发言是充分说明了右派分子对党进攻的疯狂性。她竟然狂妄到要发动共产党员和右派分子一起向党进攻，恐怕是要发动联合攻势，来个内应外合，以求把党搞垮。她居然大言不惭地干涉起共产党内的事务，还要党的负责干部来暴露党内的秘密。上海新闻日报副总编辑陆诒也要“党团员在整风中起义”。他们这样互相呼应用心可谓恶毒矣！由此可以见到，右派分子对党实行的是全面进攻：从政治、思想到组织。他们在进攻中是有一套纲领、策略和战术。
    确实，右派分子的进攻对于共产党员是一次考验。现在看来，绝大多数共产党员是经得起考验的，是对党忠诚的。右派分子煽动党内的“不满”情绪是无能为力的。那是右派分子的妄想！于是对于这些坚定的共产党员，右派分子就责骂他们是“宗派”、是“无耻”、是“没有良心”，如此等等。共产党员难道能够被骂倒和吓倒吗？真是想入非非！共产党员是在斗争中生活和成长的。他们只会越斗越坚强，对于敌视共产党的人，他们是懂得应该如何对付的。当然，我们不用讳言，在这次右派分子的进攻中，我们党内是有少数不坚定的分子。他们是经不起考验的，他们一遇到风浪就动摇了，就迷失方向了。有人就同右派分子联在一起，组成“合唱队”，或者如周颖、陆诒之流所希望的，“立即出马”打冲锋和“起义”。这是一些在括弧里面的“共产党员”。右派分子称他们是“起义分子”、是“有良心的人”。自然，党内出现少数这样的叛变分子是并不奇怪的。我们知道，社会上的阶级斗争总是会在党内反映出来的。每当历史车轮急速地前进的时候，总会有些人被摔掉。
    从周颖、陆诒之流的发言中，使我们更加深切地感到，作为一个共产党员，坚定地站稳党的立场，保持自己思想的纯洁，是何等的重要呵！对于有修正主义思想（否认党的领导、否认民主集中制、否认党的纪律、否认党性和阶级性等等）的人，难道不应当更加警惕吗？有多少野心分子是想钻党的空子和利用共产党员呵！周颖的发言所发出来的虽是毒气，但有教育意义。因此，值得一书。
