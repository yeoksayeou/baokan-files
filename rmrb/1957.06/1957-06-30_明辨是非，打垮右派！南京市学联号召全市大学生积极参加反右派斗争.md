　　Distinguish Right from Wrong, Defeat the Rightists!
　　Nanjing University Students' Federation Calls on All University Students in the City to Actively Participate in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    This newspaper reports On the expanded meeting of the Nanjing City Student Union Committee held on the 25th, the student union chairpersons of ten universities burst out with a common language from the bottom of their hearts: University students resolutely and forever follow the Communist Party.
    Zheng Hongyi, chairman of the Nanjing University Student Union, said: "After the Party launched the rectification movement, the rightists in the school took the opportunity of helping the Party to rectify and incited students to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and negate socialism. They stole the name of the student union to carry out external activities; at that time, a small number of students were also confused by this evil wind. After the People's Daily editorial 'Why is this?' was published, the true face of the rightist fallacies was revealed, and the vast majority of students brightened their eyes and resolutely stood on the side of the Party and socialism. At present, the students have bravely thrown themselves into the anti-rightist struggle."
    Ji Yongxin, chairman of the Nanjing Aeronautical Institute Student Union, said: "The students of our school said that they will never allow rightists to attack the Communist Party. The students also said that the rightists' delusion of finding supporters among young students cannot be realized. We must cultivate ourselves to become proletarian intellectuals." Jin Qiong, vice chairman of the East China Institute of Water Conservancy, Meng Qi, chairman of the Nanjing Pharmaceutical College Student Union, and Mu Jian, chairman of the Jiangsu Medical College Student Union, also spoke.
    At the meeting, Guo Le, chairman of the Jinling Union Theological Seminary Student Union, also said: "Our seminary is a Christian church school. Before liberation, all the power of Chinese Christianity was controlled by foreigners. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement was launched, making Chinese Christianity obtain unprecedented true independence and new life in history. We are willing to join students from other universities to actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle."
    Qian Weimin, chairman of the Nanjing City Student Union, said: "Everyone has just expressed a solemn attitude and expressed the students' will to condemn the rightists." He said: "What is the greatest ideal of our young people? Our study today is for socialist labor tomorrow. When it comes to democracy and freedom, we are also very clear that the 'May 20th' and 'April 1st' student movements took place in Nanjing. What kind of democracy and freedom did the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group give us? Young students, separated from the leadership of the Communist Party, have no future. The Student Union firmly supports the students' demands for anti-rightist struggle and firmly supports the students to carry out the anti-rightist struggle to the end."
    The meeting finally passed a resolution calling on Nanjing university students to actively participate in the struggle to refute the reactionary remarks of the rightists. The resolution said: In order to defend the Communist Party and defend socialism, university students must be ideologically vigilant, earnestly study Chairman Mao's speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in order to distinguish right from wrong, resolutely crush the rampant attacks of the rightists, and transform themselves into intellectuals who loyally serve the socialist cause.

　　明辨是非，打垮右派！
　　南京市学联号召全市大学生积极参加反右派斗争
    本报讯　在25日举行的南京市学生联合会委员扩大会议上，十所高等学校的学生会主席从心底迸发出共同的语言：大学生坚决地永远地跟着共产党走。
    南京大学学生会主席郑弘毅说：“党开展整风运动以后，校内右派分子利用帮助党整风的机会，煽动同学否定共产党领导、否定社会主义，窃用学生会的名义外出活动；当时并有一小部分同学受了这股邪风的迷惑。人民日报社论‘这是为什么？’等发表以后，右派谬论的真面目被揭露了，绝大多数同学都擦亮了眼睛，坚决站到党和社会主义立场方面来。目前，同学们已经勇敢地投入反右派斗争。”
    南京航空学院学生会主席计永心说：“我校同学表示决不允许右派分子向共产党进攻。同学们并表示，右派分子要在青年学生中找支持者的妄想是不可能实现的，我们要培养自己成为无产阶级的劳动知识分子。”华东水利学院学生会副主席金琼、南京药学院学生会主席孟奇和江苏医学院学生会主席穆鉴也讲了话。
    会上，金陵协和神学院学生会主席郭乐也说：“我们神学院是基督教教会学校，解放前中国基督教一切大权都操纵在外国人手里，解放后在党的领导下，开展了三自爱国运动，使中国基督教获得了历史上前所未有的真正独立和新生。我们愿意跟其他高等学校的同学一起，积极投入反右派斗争。”
    南京市学联主席钱为民说：“大家刚才都表示了严正的态度，表达了同学声讨右派的意志。”他说：“我们青年们最大的理想是什么？我们今天的学习是为了明天的社会主义劳动。谈到民主自由，我们也很清楚，‘五·二○’、‘四·一’学生运动就发生在南京，国民党反动统治集团给我们些什么民主自由呢？青年学生脱离了共产党的领导，就没有任何前途。学联坚决支持同学们反右派斗争的要求，坚决支持同学们把反右派斗争进行到底。”
    会议最后通过号召南京市大学生积极参加驳斥右派反动言论的斗争的决议。决议中说：为了保卫共产党，保卫社会主义，大学生要从思想上警觉起来，认真地学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，以明辨是非，坚决粉碎右派分子的猖狂进攻，并把自己改造成为一个为社会主义事业忠诚服务的知识分子。
