—On Cadres in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, Before and After Participating in Field Labor

By Our Correspondent Li Lianbin

In the vast countryside of Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, two sayings are circulating: "You go produce," and "We go produce." Now, many farmers have combined these two sentences into one: "You go produce, and we go produce." When you ask about the origin of these two sentences, they will tell you with unusual warmth and excitement.

What do these two sentences mean? They represent two situations, or rather, they represent two periods. The first two sentences represent the cadres being detached from the masses, only ordering the masses to produce; the latter sentence represents the cadres and the masses becoming one, leading the masses in production; the first two sentences represent a period after the land reform, and the latter sentence represents a period after the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, when the county party committee emphasized "leading production with production."

The situation is this: In 1952, Jinxian County concluded the land reform movement. A large number of cadres, who had grown up in the struggle, were gradually distributed to various leading units in townships, districts, and the county. Veteran cadres from outside the area gradually left the countryside and transferred to industrial and other fronts. Almost all the cadres remaining in the county, districts, and townships were new cadres who had emerged from the land reform struggle. With the end of the land reform, the traditional style of "eating, living, and laboring together" and sharing weal and woe with the masses gradually disappeared. The boundary between cadres and the masses became increasingly clear. The masses began to be dissatisfied with the cadres, and some openly scolded the township and cooperative cadres as "landlords of the fields" and "new landlords," and so on. One day, a farmer in Wuli Township who was plowing the field saw a cadre walking by the field, so he vigorously whipped the ox, cursing the animal while pointing at people, saying, "You work hard, let's see how long you can strut around." The cadres heard these words and said, "The masses have changed." The masses said, "The cadres have changed." Whether "the masses had changed" or "the cadres had changed" became an important issue of great concern to the county party committee. After several discussions and studies by the county party committee, it was believed that although it was certainly wrong for the masses to scold the cadres, the problem lay with the cadres. If there was a change, it was "the cadres who had changed." The cadres' style of hard work, simplicity, and sharing weal and woe with the masses had changed. In particular, with the exception of the first secretary of the county party committee and two others, almost all the county, district, and township cadres in Jinxian County were local people, and most of them were originally farmers. Twenty-six of the twenty-nine members of the county party committee were from peasant backgrounds. Therefore, even a slight bit of special treatment or putting on a "bureaucratic air" by the cadres would arouse the dissatisfaction of the farmers. Some cadres were not conscious enough. For example, one day last summer, when the farmers were laboring and producing under the scorching sun, a township cadre from Zizhi Township named Wan Fagen wore a silk suit, white tennis shoes, and held an umbrella, pointing and gesticulating by the field, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. The cadres who were scolded by the masses as "landlords of the fields" who "pointed fingers at the fields and corners of the land" referred to this kind of person.

The county party committee believed that if the cadres' style of "putting on airs" and "special treatment" was not changed, there would be a danger of the Party organization becoming detached from the masses. Although it had repeatedly emphasized going deep into the grassroots and maintaining close ties with the masses in the past, the cadres still could not go deep, and the relationship with the masses had not improved significantly; although it had repeatedly emphasized going deep into the fields and deep into the production process, the cadres only ran around in the fields, and still could not discover or solve any key problems. After inspection, it was found that "going deep into the fields and deep into the production process" was actually just an empty slogan. Many cadres were "going deep level by level," with the county going deep into the district, the district going deep into the township, and the township running around on the field ridges.

After repeated research, the county party committee believed that only by "leading production with production" could it truly go deep into the fields, deep into the production process, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The method of "leading production with production" should be extended to township cadres, district cadres, and even county leading cadres. The county party committee believed that "leading production with production" was not only an effective way to solve practical work problems, but also a fundamental method for improving the relationship between cadres and the masses.

It was still the stage when spring plowing and production began. The county party committee put forward the issue of digging cellars to accumulate fertilizer. Generally speaking, the county had low yields, great potential, and insufficient fertilizer. The masses of farmers also knew that digging cellars was good for increasing production, but they did not have the habit of digging cellars to accumulate fertilizer, and their actions were not active, fearing that wasting labor would not be worth the loss. Therefore, the county party committee proposed that all county, district, and township cadres leading agricultural production should take the lead in digging a manure cellar. Xing Haichuan, the first secretary of the county party committee, and three other leading cadres of the county party committee went to Doutang Township to take the lead in digging a manure cellar with a capacity of more than 60 dan of manure. The news of Secretary Xing digging a manure cellar quickly spread, greatly promoting the enthusiasm of cadres to participate in labor production and the masses to dig cellars. According to statistics in March, cadres throughout the county dug 142 manure cellars. The masses in Doutang Township dug more than 1,200 manure cellars.

Digging a manure cellar is more effective than giving several political lessons. The masses became closer to the cadres, and some said, "These are truly Communist Party cadres."

Practical experience proves that cadres participating in production is a fundamental way to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. Now, the 17 members of the county party committee who regularly go to the countryside to lead production all participate in labor production to varying degrees. The members of the standing committee of the county party committee spend 22 or 23 days a month in the countryside, except for returning to the county twice a month to attend meetings of the standing committee. The members of the county party committee spend 26 or 27 days a month in the countryside, except for returning to the county once a month to report on their work. During these 20-odd days, each person can mostly spend three to five days participating in labor production. County Head Shu Kaide bought a pair of manure baskets, a carrying pole, and a shovel at his own expense to help the masses dig ditch mud, dig cow manure, and help the masses accumulate fertilizer.

Under the leadership of the county leading cadres, the enthusiasm of cadres in districts, townships, and cooperatives to participate in production has become even higher. In the past two months, cadres in counties, districts, and townships throughout the county have helped the masses accumulate more than 11,000 dan of fertilizer and worked more than 550 labor days. When the masses saw the cadres participating in production, they all said, "The cadres are all participating in production. Who would we be able to face if we didn't actively produce?" In order to save time, the masses changed the old habit of going home for lunch, "sending food to the fields" and eating lunch by the fields, thus saving a lot of time for eating.

Now, cadres participating in labor production has become a trend from top to bottom throughout the county and has begun to become a regular system. The county party committee regards cadres participating in labor production as an important condition for evaluating cadres. The county party committee initially believes that each member of the county party committee can regularly spend seven to ten days a month participating in labor, which is achievable.

Due to the participation of county leading cadres and the vast number of district and township cadres in production, new atmospheres have appeared in the relationship between cadres and the masses. Now the masses are saying that "the cadres have changed," but they have not become worse, but better. The cadres are also saying that "the masses have changed," not that they have become disobedient, but that they have become concerned about the cadres. In the past, when cadres went to the countryside, the township provided meals, but now the farmers invite the cadres to eat at their homes. When the masses speak to the cadres, they no longer say "you" and "we," but they always use "we" in their words. Compared with the situation of scolding cadres, what a great change this is! The masses say that the cadres have five good qualities: first, participating in production is good; second, being responsible for solving problems in their work is good; third, discussing matters and studying them collectively is good; fourth, not putting on airs and having a good work style is good; and fifth, caring about the masses' thinking is good. Li Xiong, a member of the Qianfang Cooperative in Chixi Township, said: "A county head named Cheng from the Kuomintang used to go to the countryside in a sedan chair carried by people, with more than a dozen guards. Now our County Head Shu is carrying manure baskets on his shoulders. I have never seen this since I was born."

Now, when the masses see the cadres working in the fields during the day and studying their work at night, they know that being a cadre is not an easy task, and they no longer say, "It's easy to be a cadre."

    变了
    ——记江西进贤县干部参加田间劳动前后
    本报记者　李连斌
    在江西省进贤县的广大农村里，流传着这样两句话：“你们去生产”，“我们来生产”。现在，许多农民把这两句话当作一句话说了：“你们去生产和我们来生产”。当你问起这两句话的来由的时候，他们会以一种异常亲切和兴奋的口吻告诉你。
    这两句是什么意思呢？它代表了两种情况，或者说代表了两个时期。前两句话代表了干部脱离群众，只命令群众去生产；后一句话代表干部和群众打成了一片，带领群众生产；前两句话代表了土地改革后的一个时期，后一句话代表了二中全会以后县委强调“以生产领导生产”的一个时期。
    情况是这样的，1952年进贤全县结束了土地改革运动，从斗争中成长起来大批干部，陆续分布在乡、区和县的各个领导单位，外来的老干部陆续离开农村转移到工业等阵地去了。留在县区乡的干部几乎全部是土地改革斗争中涌现出来的新干部。随着土地改革的结束，那种“同吃、同住、同劳动”与群众同甘共苦的传统作风逐渐消失。干部和群众的界限越来越分得清楚了。群众开始对干部不满，有的公开骂乡社干部是“田老板”“新地主”等等。有一天，五里乡一个正在犁田的农民看见一个干部从田边走过，就用力地打牛，指畜骂人地说：“你好好劳动，看你摆来摆去能摆多久。”干部们听到了这些话，说“群众变了”，群众说“干部变了”。到底是“群众变了”还是“干部变了”，成了县委十分关注的一个重要问题。经过县委几次讨论和研究，认为群众骂干部固然不对，但问题的产生在于干部。如果说变的话，是“干部变了”。干部那种艰苦朴素、同群众同甘共苦的作风变了。特别是进贤县除县委第一书记等三个人以外，几乎所有的县区乡干部都是本地人，原来也大都是作田人。二十九个县委委员中就有二十六人是本地农民出身的。因此，干部稍稍有一点特殊化或对农民摆一点“官架子”，就会引起农民不满。有些干部是不够自觉的，如在去年夏季的一天，农民们在炽烈的太阳下劳动生产，自治乡一个叫万发根的乡干部，身穿纺绸服，脚穿白力士鞋，手中还撑了一把伞，在田边指手划脚，引起群众很大不满。群众骂的那种“田老板”、“田垅地角指手划脚”的干部，就是指的这种人。
    县委认为干部这种“摆架子”“特殊化”的作风不转变，就有使党组织脱离群众的危险。过去虽然一再强调深入基层，密切联系群众，干部们还是深入不下去，和群众的关系还是没有显著的改善；虽然一再强调深入田间、深入生产过程，干部们也只是到田间里跑一跑，还是发现不了和解决不了什么关键性问题。经过检查，发现“深入田间、深入生产过程”实际上不过是空口号，许多干部是“逐级深入”，县深入到区，区深入到乡，乡深入到田塍上跑一跑。
    县委反复研究的结果，认为只有“以生产领导生产”才能真正作到深入田间，深入生产过程，及时发现问题和解决问题。应该把“以生产领导生产”的办法推广到乡干部、区干部，以至县的领导干部。县委认为“以生产领导生产”不但是解决实际工作问题的一个有效办法，而且是改善干部和群众关系的一个根本方法。
    那还是春耕生产开始的阶段，县委提出了挖窖积肥的问题。这个县一般说来产量低、潜力大、肥料不足。农民群众也知道挖窖对增产有好处，但是没有挖窖积肥的习惯，行动不积极，怕浪费劳动力得不偿失。于是县委提出全县所有领导农业生产的县、区、乡干部，每人带头挖一个粪窖。县委第一书记邢海川同志和另外三个县委领导干部到斗塘乡带头挖了一个容六十多担粪的粪窖。邢书记挖粪窖的消息很快地传开了，对干部参加劳动生产和群众挖窖的积极性起了很大的推动作用。据3月份统计，全县干部挖的粪窖就达一百四十二个。斗塘乡群众挖的粪窖就达一千二百多个。
    挖一个粪窖比上几堂政治课的作用还大。群众对干部亲近了，有的说：“这才是共产党的干部”。
    实践经验证明：干部参加生产是改善干部和群众关系的一个根本办法。现在，经常下乡领导生产的十七名县委委员都或多或少地参加了劳动生产。县常委一个月除回县开两次常委会，有二十二天或二十三天的时间在农村。县委委员每月除回县汇报一次工作，有二十六天或二十七天在农村。在二十几天中，每人大多都能以三天到五天的时间参加劳动生产。县长舒开德自己出钱买了一对粪箕、一根扁担、一把锨，帮助群众挖沟泥、挖牛粪，帮助群众积肥。
    在县领导干部的带动下，全县区干部、乡干部和社干部参加生产的积极性更高了。全县县区乡干部两个月来帮助群众积肥一万一千多担，做了五百五十多劳动日。群众看到干部参加生产，都说：“干部都参加生产，我们不积极生产能对得住谁呢？”为了争取时间，群众改变了中午回家吃饭的老习惯，“送饭上田”，在田边吃午饭，这样节省许多吃饭的时间。
    现在，干部参加劳动生产，已经在全县范围内从上到下形成一种风气，并开始成为一种经常的制度。县委把干部参加劳动生产作为鉴定干部的一项重要条件。县委初步认为每个县委委员一个月经常以七天到十天的时间参加劳动，是可以作得到的。
    由于县领导干部和广大区乡干部参加生产，在干部和群众的关系上出现了新气象。现在群众又说“干部变了”，但不是变坏了，而是变好了。干部也又说“群众变了”，不是变得不听话了，而是变得关心干部了。过去干部下乡，由乡派饭吃，现在是农民叫干部到家吃饭，群众对干部说话，不是“你们”“我们”的了，而张口闭口都是“我们”怎样了。这和谩骂干部的情况对比起来是一个多么大的变化呀！群众说干部有五好：第一就是参加生产好；第二是工作负责解决问题好；第三是有事商量集体研究好；第四是不摆架子作风好；第五是关心群众思想好。池溪乡前坊社社员李雄标说：“国民党的一个程县长，下乡坐人抬的轿子，带十多个卫兵。现在我们的舒县长肩挑粪箕，出世以来从没有见过。”
    现在群众看见干部白天生产，黑夜研究工作，知道当一个干部也不是轻快的事情，再不说：“干部好当了。”
