The Bourgeois Orientation of Wenhui Daily in a Certain Period
　　Editorial Department of This Newspaper
　　The following article, entitled "Recorded for Reference," appeared in the June 10th issue of Wenhui Daily. Shanghai's Wenhui Daily and Beijing's Guangming Daily have published a large number of good reports and good articles in the past. However, the basic political direction of these two newspapers has, for a short period, become the direction of bourgeois newspapers. During a certain period, these two newspapers took advantage of the slogan of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the Communist Party's rectification movement to publish a large number of articles expressing bourgeois viewpoints without preparing to criticize them, as well as inflammatory reports. This is verifiable in the newspapers. Some people in these two newspapers made a major mistake in the viewpoint of the newspapers. They confused the fundamental distinction between newspapers in capitalist countries and newspapers in socialist countries. On this point, some editors and reporters of other newspapers also have this situation, and some journalism professors in some universities also have this situation. It is not only Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily that are like this, but these two newspapers are particularly prominent. Erroneous viewpoints can be changed through research, consideration, and criticism. We have expectations for them. Judging from the situation of these two newspapers in recent days, the direction seems to have changed somewhat. Non-Party newspapers should not, of course, be run exactly the same as Party newspapers and should have their own characteristics. However, their basic direction should be consistent with other newspapers. This is because, in socialist countries, newspapers are a reflection of the socialist economy, that is, the planned economy based on public ownership, through news media, and are different from the newspapers in capitalist countries, which are a reflection of anarchic and competitive economies through news media. In a period when class distinctions exist in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle. We hope to launch a debate on this issue in order to reach a consensus on this issue. Some Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among journalists also have bourgeois journalistic viewpoints and should also consider, study, and criticize this erroneous viewpoint. Dogmatic journalistic viewpoints and stereotyped writing styles should also be criticized. This aspect of things is very annoying. Party newspapers, including this newspaper, have made mistakes in this regard. Errors in this aspect must also be thoroughly criticized in the debate. In this way, a struggle on two fronts, against "left" and right, must be waged on the issue of journalism. Yao Wenyuan's article only implicitly pointed out the bourgeois orientation of Wenhui Daily and saw the obvious and harmful tendency of some people in Wenhui Daily standing on the bourgeois position to carry out class struggle against the proletariat. It is a good article, so it is reprinted here. And, taking this opportunity, we express our views to our colleagues – Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily – for their consideration.

　　文汇报在一个时间内的资产阶级方向
　　本报编辑部
    下面转载的这篇文章见于6月10日文汇报，题为“录以备考”。上海文汇报和北京光明日报在过去一个时间内，登了大量的好报道和好文章。但是，这两个报纸的基本政治方向，却在一个短时期内，变成了资产阶级报纸的方向。这两个报纸在一个时间内利用“百家争鸣”这个口号和共产党的整风运动，发表了大量表现资产阶级观点而并不准备批判的文章和带煽动性的报道，这是有报可查的。这两个报纸的一部分人对于报纸的观点犯了一个大错误。他们混淆资本主义国家的报纸和社会主义国家的报纸的原则区别。在这一点上，其他有些报纸的一些编辑和记者也有这种情形，一些大学的一些新闻系教师也有这种情形，不只文汇、光明两报如此，不过这两报特别显得突出罢了。错误观点是可以经过研究、考虑和批判加以改变的，我们对他们期待着。从最近几天这两个报纸的情况看来，方针似乎已有所改变。党外报纸当然不应当办得和党报一模一样，应有它们自己的特色。但是，它们的基本方向，应当是和其它报纸一致的。这是因为在社会主义国家，报纸是社会主义经济即在公有制基础上的计划经济通过新闻手段的反映，和资本主义国家报纸是无政府状态的和集团竞争的经济通过新闻手段的反映不相同。在世界上存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸又总是阶级斗争的工具。我们希望在这个问题上展开辩论，以求大家在这个问题上取得一致的认识。新闻记者中，有一部分共产党员和共青团员也有资产阶级新闻观点，也应当考虑、研究、批评这个错误观点。教条主义的新闻观点和八股文风，也是应当批判的。这一方面的东西是很讨厌的。党报，包括本报在内，在这一方面犯有错误。这一方面的错误，在辩论中也必须展开批判。这样一来，在新闻问题上就要作反“左”反右的两条战线上的斗争。姚文元的文章只是含蓄地指出文汇报的资产阶级方向，看到了文汇报的一些人站在资产阶级立场上向无产阶级进行阶级斗争的这个明显的和有害的倾向，是一篇好文章，故转载于此。并且借这个由头，向我们的同业——文汇报和光明日报说出我们的观点，以供考虑。
