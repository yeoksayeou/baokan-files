    After the match, the reporter interviewed Wakhti, the famous Indian international football referee appointed by the International Football Federation to officiate the match, and the linesmen, Burmese international referee U Ba Dan and Cao Genyuan (they were also the linesmen during the Jakarta match).
    Wakhti's first question to the reporter was, "What is the Beijing audience's opinion of my refereeing work?" When the reporter told him that the audience was very satisfied with his refereeing, as could be seen from the applause after he blew the whistle, he nodded happily. Then he expressed his views on the game. He said: The Chinese team played very well at the beginning, but after twenty minutes, they played very loosely. In the second half, they also started well, but later they ran out of steam.
    Burmese international referee U Ba Dan and Cao Genyuan said: "The Chinese team played better than last time. In this match, the Chinese team took advantage of every opportunity to shoot. The biggest shortcoming of the Chinese team in the Jakarta match was that they missed many opportunities to shoot."

    国际裁判谈这场足球赛
    比赛完毕后，记者访问了国际足球协会指派担任这场比赛的印度著名的足球国际裁判员华克蒂和巡边员缅甸国际裁判吴巴当和曹根元（在雅加达比赛时，他俩也是巡边员）。
    华克蒂第一句话便问记者“北京的观众对他执行的裁判工作有什么意见？”当记者告诉他观众对他的裁判工作非常满意，从他鸣笛后观众的鼓掌便可以看出。他高兴地点点头。接着他发表了对这场球的看法。他说：中国队一开始打得非常好，但是过了二十分钟以后，便一直踢得很松懈。下半时，也是一开始很好，但到后来便体力不支了。
    缅甸的国际裁判吴巴当和曹根元说：“中国队比上次踢得好，这次比赛中国队利用了每次可以射门的机会。在雅加达比赛时中国队最大的缺点便是失掉了多次射门的机会。”
