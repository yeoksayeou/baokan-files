Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: The welfare of children in Eastern European people's democratic countries is developing rapidly. There are now more than 1,340 pediatricians in Czechoslovakia, approximately four times the number in 1937. The children of the working people enjoy free medical treatment. There are over 1,100 nurseries and over 6,300 kindergartens nationwide. This year, 120,000 children will spend their summer vacation at Young Pioneer camps, 20,000 more than last year.

The Polish government is very concerned about the lives of children. Industrial enterprises, mines, construction sites, and state-owned farms throughout the country have nurseries and kindergartens. More than seventy Young Pioneer Palaces and Student Palaces have been established in Warsaw, Krakow, and other towns for children. Every summer, more than 500,000 children go to summer camps for vacation.

The Central Council of Trade Unions of Romania will set up more than 170 campsites in the mountains and seaside for children during the holidays this summer. There are now more than 2,700 "Children's Homes" throughout the country, where children can receive medical care and nutritious food. More than 200,000 Young Pioneers go to these places in their spare time to participate in a variety of rich and beneficial activities such as handicrafts, dance, piano, museum studies, and metallurgy.

Bulgaria has made great progress in maternal and child health care. In 1956, there were more than 1,470 maternal and child health care stations, nearly three times more than before liberation. About half of the preschool children in the country live in nurseries. 99% of school-age children attend school.

Albania is also experiencing rapid development in maternal and child health care and childcare. The number of kindergartens has now increased to more than thirteen times that of the pre-war period. Every summer, school-age children spend their summer vacations in sanatoriums in the best resorts in the country.

    罗马尼亚工会中央理事会今年夏天将在山区和海滨为度假期的儿童设立一百七十多个露营地。现在全国有两千七百多所“儿童之家”，儿童在那里可以得到医药照顾和营养丰富的食物。有二十多万少先队员在空闲的时候就到这些地方参加手工艺、舞蹈、钢琴、博物、冶金等各种小组的丰富而有益的活动。
