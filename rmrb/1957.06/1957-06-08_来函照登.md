    Letters to the Editor
    In the People's Daily report on June 6th regarding my speech assisting the Party's rectification campaign at the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) small group, there are several issues that do not align with my original intentions. I hereby issue the following clarifications:
    First: "She said that if the Party directly commands Party members, it will throw the country into chaos." What I said was, "If the Party directly commands Party members in administrative departments, it will throw the national administrative system into chaos." My intention is to prevent the Party from substituting for the government.
    Second: "She once again raised the issue that the transformation of real estate developers in Shanghai violates the Constitution." What I said was that it is completely correct and in accordance with the Constitution for Shanghai to include private real estate developers, private housing management companies, and houses of a capitalist business nature into the scope of socialist transformation. However, the inclusion of individual houses used as means of production and private residences used as means of livelihood into joint state-private ownership during the work is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution.
    Third: "Tan Tiwu believes that the Communist Party can send Party members to judicial and procuratorial organs to take charge of work, but these departments should not be led by the Party committee." What I said was, "These departments should not be led by a *single* Party committee."

    6月6日的人民日报在报道我在民革中央小组帮助党整风的发言中，有以下几个和我的原意不符的问题，特此声明：
    第一：“她说，党直接指挥党员，会把国家搞乱了。”我是说“党直接指挥行政部门的党员，会把国家行政系统搞乱了”。我的意思是不要以党代政。
    第二：“她再一次提出了上海对房产商的改造问题是违反宪法的”。我是说上海将私营房产商和私营经租公司及属于资本主义经营性质的房屋纳入社会主义改造范围是完全正确的、是符合宪法的。但是在工作中把个别的作为生产资料的房屋和作为生活资料的私人住宅纳入公私合营是和宪法第十一条的规定不符合的。　第三：“谭惕吾认为，共产党可以派党员到司法、检察等机关去担任负责工作，但这些部门不应该受党委领导。”我是说，“这些部门不应该由一个党委领导。”
