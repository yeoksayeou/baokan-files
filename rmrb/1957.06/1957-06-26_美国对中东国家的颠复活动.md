　　U.S. Subversive Activities Against Middle Eastern Countries
　　Feng Zhidan
    In order to carry out colonial plunder in the Middle East, colonialists, in addition to using gunboat diplomacy and economic aggression, habitually engaged in subversive conspiracies in various Middle Eastern countries. American imperialism has inherited this mantle. It sometimes cunningly puts on a "polite" facade in front of the people of the Middle East, but behind their backs, they are engaged in activities to overthrow the governments of other countries. The U.S. "Chicago Daily Tribune" bluntly stated: "The policy of American oil industrialists, diplomats, and military representatives towards the Near East is to be polite to all Arabs while awaiting the opportunity; if the rulers of Arab countries are overly critical, then some Americans will be forced to help instigate coups."
    After the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was introduced, Max Weston Thornburg, one of the main founders of the "oil empire" of the "New Jersey Standard Oil Company," stated in an article published in "Fortune Magazine" that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" opened up enormous possibilities for "all sorts of political interference" in Middle Eastern countries. He openly said: "In Middle Eastern countries, we should work through the leaders of those countries, starting from the top. We should support those whose goals are in line with ours." Thornburg believed that the current national leaders of Egypt did not meet the "needs" of American policy, and therefore, efforts should be made to "change" the direction of the Egyptian government. "Those who submit to me will prosper, and those who resist me will perish." This is a naked confession of the U.S. imperialism's political interference and subversive activities in Middle Eastern countries.
    The recent events in Jordan are one of the latest examples of Washington's subversive activities in the Middle East. As everyone knows, during the six months that the Nabulsi cabinet was in power in Jordan, Jordan adhered to a policy of peace and neutrality and solidarity with Arab countries, safeguarding its national sovereignty and independence, and actively opposing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" of aggression. Thus, the Nabulsi government did not meet the "needs" of the United States and was therefore poisoned by Washington. Colonel Sweeney, the military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, directly participated in the conspiracy to overthrow the Nabulsi government. Former Jordanian Chief of Staff Nuwar and Deputy Chief of Staff Hayari revealed these facts. Nuwar said: "A month before the cabinet of former Prime Minister Nabulsi was dissolved, the Royal Palace, the U.S. Embassy, and some politicians acting as agents of the Eisenhower Doctrine exerted great pressure on me to organize a military cabinet with me as prime minister." Colonel Sweeney also wanted him to create "favorable conditions" for Richards, the U.S. President's special envoy who was then peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, to carry out aggressive activities in Jordan. According to Arab newspapers, dozens of American "experts" planning the coup were already active in Amman before the Jordanian political crisis occurred. According to United Press International, the United States had "guaranteed" to give King Hussein of Jordan a large amount of "aid," but on the condition that Jordan's patriotic figures be "excluded" from the cabinet. Of course, in the process of subverting the Jordanian government this time, the United States not only used its fifth column but also openly mobilized its Sixth Fleet to carry out shameless military intimidation against the Jordanian people.
    As for Syria, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is also painstakingly trying to overthrow its nationalist government. The most recent subversive conspiracy planned by foreign imperialism was uncovered between October and November last year. According to the investigation by the Syrian military authorities and the confessions of the arrested conspirators in court, the United States, Britain, and Iraq were all involved in this subversive conspiracy. In the summer of 1956, Iraqi Foreign Minister Bashayan discussed the organization of the conspiracy with Sheshakli, a Syrian fugitive politician and agent of the United States, in Geneva. Later, Sheshakli arrived in Beirut to meet with other conspirators, drew up a plan for rebellion, decided to obtain 800 rifles, 6 automatic weapons, and a large amount of ammunition from Iraq, and prepared to launch an armed coup in November in coordination with the Israeli offensive and the landing of British and French troops. The military attachés of Britain and Iraq in Lebanon participated in the planning of this conspiracy. According to the confessions of Syrian traitors in court, they had "negotiations with some British and American diplomats"; "Americans in Beirut" had close ties with the criminals in this subversion case.
    After this subversive conspiracy was crushed, in early February of this year, latent imperialist agents launched riots in Aleppo, a major town in northern Syria. Immediately following the outbreak of the Jordanian crisis, Washington sent a signal saying that "the next Middle East crisis will break out in Syria." A May 1 dispatch from International News Service revealed that the United States expected the collapse of the current Syrian government and the "formation of a conservative regime" to "split the Syria-Egypt alliance."
    Syrian newspapers have recently revealed a conspiracy by U.S. diplomatic personnel in Syria to overthrow the current Syrian government and attempt to assassinate a number of Syrian leaders. The United States spent millions of dollars and secretly transported weapons and secret agents into Syria.
    As for Egypt, needless to say. The United States and other Western colonial countries are constantly trying to overthrow the Nasser government. Since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, Egypt has successively uncovered a British espionage case and a huge subversive case planned by foreign imperialism. The September 7, 1956, issue of the Paris weekly "International Forum" carried an article saying that the "West's" approach to the Suez Canal issue was to "bring down Nasser," and these ferocious imperialists had long planned to find a "nominal candidate for the head of the Cairo government" "once there was a change in the Egyptian regime." The November 9, 1956, issue of "U.S. News & World Report" also confessed that "the United States has done a lot of work to weaken Nasser's position," and "the United States hopes that the forces that are already in action will eliminate Nasser in about a year without military action." This fully illustrates the U.S. imperialism's insane hatred for the Egyptian government.
    As for the governments of those countries that submit to the U.S.'s aggressive interests, the United States is unwilling to relax its control over them. For example, regarding the Iranian government, American oil tycoon Rockefeller said very proudly in a secret letter to the U.S. President that the United States is now "able to control its (Iran's) entire foreign policy," and "currently, King Shah does not even dare to change his cabinet without consulting our ambassador." Rockefeller was actually saying that the U.S. ambassador to Tehran could easily make the Iranian cabinet fall into disrepute. Not long ago, the Iranian Ala cabinet collapsed precisely because the United States was greatly dissatisfied with the killing of three Point Four Program officials in southeastern Iran.
    The U.S.'s subversive activities in the Middle East did not begin today. After World War II, in order to intensify the scramble for the Middle East's sphere of influence and oil resources, the United States launched a fierce struggle with old-brand colonial countries such as Britain and France. They tried their best to subvert each other's proxy regimes and support their own proxies to come to power. For example, in 1948-1949, King Yahya of Yemen attempted to get close to the United States and was overthrown by Britain; not long after, the U.S. spy agency organized a new coup and supported people who were useful to the United States to come to power. Later, this coup was suppressed by British troops. In Transjordan, the assassination of the pro-British King Abdullah in 1951 was also the result of the Anglo-American struggle. In Syria, from 1949 to 1951, American and British imperialism repeatedly planned four coups. Finally, the United States supported its proxy Sheshakli to come to power. It was not until 1954 that this regime, which obeyed the United States, was overthrown by the Syrian people. In 1955, in order to force Syria to join the Baghdad Pact, the United States again instructed its proxy, the Syrian National Socialist Party, to assassinate Colonel Maliki, the leader of Syrian patriotic soldiers and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, and attempted to restore Sheshakli to power. However, this conspiracy was finally crushed by the patriotic forces of Syria. In Iran, in 1949-1950, two consecutive prime ministers became victims of the Anglo-American struggle. When the movement of the Iranian people to nationalize oil flourished in 1951-1953, the United States and Britain jointly planned the conspiracy to subvert the Mossadegh cabinet. In that incident, McClane, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Iran, even directly commanded the riots to subvert the Mossadegh government in a military vehicle.
    U.S. imperialism uses any means to achieve its goal of aggression in the Middle East. It is well known that it cultivates and buys those politicians who have lost their sense of national identity or elements with personal ambitions in various Middle Eastern countries as its agents. It has such agents in many countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. And the large number of so-called diplomatic personnel from the United States stationed in Middle Eastern countries are the people who directly plan subversive conspiracies. Some of them have even been called "experts" in subversive activities in the United States.
    The subversive activities carried out by the United States and other Western colonial countries in the Middle East have made the struggle of the Middle Eastern people for national independence very complicated and arduous. The people of the Middle Eastern countries that have not yet achieved independence must constantly expose the faces of these national scum; the people of the countries that have already achieved independence must constantly raise their vigilance and relentlessly strike at these latent agents of imperialism in order to defend their national independence.

　　美国对中东国家的颠复活动
　　冯之丹
    殖民主义者为了在中东进行殖民掠夺，除了使用炮舰政策和经济侵略以外，另一惯伎就是在中东各国制造颠复阴谋。美国帝国主义承袭了这个衣钵，它有时狡狯地在中东人民面前装出“讲究礼貌”的外表，但它背地里却在干着推翻别国政府的勾当。美国“芝加哥每日论坛报”就曾露骨地说过：“美国石油工业家、外交家、军事代表人物对近东的政策，就是同一切阿拉伯人讲究礼貌以等待时机；如果阿拉伯国家的执政者责备求全，那末某些美国人就会被迫帮助策动政变。”
    在“艾森豪威尔主义”出笼以后，美国“新泽西美孚油公司”的“石油帝国”主要创始人之一，马克斯·威斯吞·汤勃格在“幸福杂志”上发表的文章里就认为，“艾森豪威尔主义”开辟了对中东国家进行“五花八门的政治干涉”的巨大可能性。他公然说：“在中东各国，我们应该通过各国领导人干事情，应该从上层开始。应该支持目标同我们相符的人。”汤勃格认为，像埃及目前的国家领导人就不符合于美国政策的“需要”，因此就要力求“改变”埃及政府的方针。“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”，这就是美帝国主义对中东国家进行政治干涉和颠复活动的赤裸裸的供认。
    最近发生的约旦事件，是华盛顿在中东进行颠复活动的最近的例证之一。大家知道，在约旦纳布西内阁执政半年期间，约旦坚持了和平中立与阿拉伯国家团结的政策，维护了自己国家的主权和独立，并且积极反对“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略政策。这样，纳布西政府就不符合美国的“需要”，因而遭到了华盛顿的毒手。美国驻安曼使馆的武官斯温尼上校直接参与了推翻纳布西政府的阴谋。约旦前陆军参谋长诺瓦尔和副参谋长哈亚里揭露了这些事实。诺瓦尔说：“在前首相纳布西的内阁被解散前一个月，王宫、美国大使馆和一些充当艾森豪威尔主义的代理人的政客对我施加强大的压力，要我组织一个以我为首相的军事内阁”。斯温尼上校并且要他给当时正在中东兜售艾森豪威尔主义”的美国总统特使理查兹创造“方便的条件”，让理查兹到约旦进行侵略活动。据阿拉伯报纸报道，在约旦政治危机发生之前，在安曼已经有数十名策划政变的美国“专家”在从事活动。据合众社透露，美国曾“保证”给予约旦国王侯赛因以大量“援助”，但条件是“排除”约旦的爱国人士于内阁之外。当然，这次美国在颠复约旦政府的过程中，不仅使用了它的第五纵队，而且还公开地调动它的第六舰队，对约旦人民进行了无耻的武力威吓。
    对叙利亚，以美国为首的帝国主义集团也在处心积虑地企图推翻它的民族主义政府。最近一次由外国帝国主义策划的颠复阴谋是在去年10月到11月间被破获的。根据叙利亚军事当局的调查和被逮捕的阴谋分子在法庭上的供认，美国、英国和伊拉克都参与了这个颠复阴谋。1956年夏天，伊拉克外交部长巴沙扬曾在日内瓦同美国的代理人、叙利亚的逃亡政客施舍克里商讨了阴谋活动的组织问题。其后，施舍克里又到达贝鲁特同其他阴谋分子会见，拟定了叛乱计划，决定从伊拉克得到步枪八百枝、自动武器六件以及大量弹药，并准备在11月间配合以色列的进攻和英法军队的登陆，发动武装政变。英国和伊拉克驻黎巴嫩的武官都参加了这一阴谋计划的策划工作。据叙利亚叛国分子在法庭上供认，他们曾同“一些英美外交界人士进行谈判”；“在贝鲁特的美国人”同这个颠复案的罪犯们有着密切的联系。
    在这个颠复阴谋被粉碎以后，今年2月上旬，潜伏的帝国主义代理人又在叙利亚的北部重镇阿勒颇发动了骚乱。而紧接着约旦危机的爆发，华盛顿便发出信号说，“下一个中东危机将在叙利亚爆发”。国际新闻社5月1日的电讯透露，美国瞩望叙利亚现政府的垮台，而“组成一个保守的政权”，使“叙利亚—埃及同盟分裂”。
    叙利亚报纸最近又揭露了美国驻叙利亚的外交人员策划推翻叙利亚现政府并且企图暗杀一批叙利亚领袖的阴谋。美国花了几百万美元，并且偷偷把武器和特务运进叙利亚。
    至于对埃及，则更不用说了。美国同英法等西方殖民国家无时不想搞垮纳赛尔政府。自从埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有以来，埃及先后破获了一个英国的间谍案和一宗由外国帝国主义策划的巨大的颠复案。1956年9月7日的巴黎“国际论坛”周刊载文说，“西方”在苏伊士运河问题上的作法就是要“搞垮纳赛尔”，这些穷凶极恶的帝国主义者们早已盘算“在埃及政权一旦发生变化时”找一个“开罗政府首脑的名义的候选人”了。1956年11月9日的“美国新闻与世界报道”也供认，“在削弱纳赛尔地位方面，美国已经作了许多工作”，“美国期望那些已经在行动中的力量将要在一年左右不用军事行动就把纳赛尔消灭掉”。这充分地说明了美国帝国主义对于埃及政府的疯狂仇视。
    对那些顺从美国侵略利益的国家政府，美国也不肯放松对它的控制。例如对伊朗政府，美国石油大王洛克菲勒在给美国总统的一封秘密信里就非常得意地说，现在美国“能够控制它（伊朗）的整个外交政策”，“目前，国王沙阿未经征求我们的大使的意见，甚至不敢更动一下他的内阁”。洛克菲勒实际上是说，美国驻德黑兰大使能够轻易地使伊朗内阁大倒其霉的。不久前，伊朗阿拉内阁正是由于在伊朗东南部发生了第四点计划三个官员的被杀事件，使美国大为不满而垮了台。
    美国在中东干颠复活动，并不是在今天才开始的。第二次世界大战以后，美国为了加紧争夺中东的势力范围和石油富源，与英法等老牌殖民国家展开了剧烈的斗争，它们竭力颠复对方的代理人政权，而扶植自己的代理人上台。如在1948—1949年间，也门国王亚哈雅企图同美国接近，就被英国搞下台去；而不久美国间谍机关组织了新的政变，把对美国有用的人扶持上台。后来这个政变又被英国军队镇压了。在外约旦，1951年亲英的国王阿卜杜拉的被刺杀，也是英美斗争的结果。在叙利亚，1949年到1951年，美英帝国主义反复地策划了四次政变，最后美国把它的代理人施舍克里扶上台，一直到1954年这个听命于美国的政权才被叙利亚人民所推翻。1955年，美国为了迫使叙利亚参加土伊协定，又指使它的代理人叙利亚国家社会党党徒刺杀了叙利亚爱国军人的领袖、陆军副参谋长马利基上校，并且企图使施舍克里的复辟。但是，这个阴谋终于被叙利亚的爱国力量所粉碎了。在伊朗，1949—1950年，连续有两个首相成了英美斗争的牺牲品。当1951—1953年伊朗人民争取石油国有化的运动蓬勃发展起来的时候，美英又联合起来策划了颠复摩萨台内阁的阴谋。在那一次事件中，美国驻伊朗的军事顾问团团长麦克兰甚至乘着军用汽车直接指挥了颠复摩萨台政府的暴乱。
    美帝国主义为了达到它侵略中东的目的，是不择手段的。它在中东各国培植和收买那些丧失民族国家观念的政客，或者有个人野心的分子作为自己的代理人，这是人所共知的事。它在伊拉克、伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦等许多国家里，都有这样的代理人。而美国驻中东国家的大量所谓外交人员，就是直接策划颠复阴谋的人。他们中间的有些人在美国甚至已被称为从事颠复活动的“专家”。
    美国和其它西方殖民国家在中东地区进行颠复活动，使中东人民争取民族独立的斗争变得十分复杂和艰巨。还没有独立的中东国家人民，必须经常揭露这些民族败类的嘴脸；已经取得独立的国家人民，更必须经常提高自己的警惕性，无情地打击这些潜伏的帝国主义的代理人，才能够保卫得住国家的独立。
