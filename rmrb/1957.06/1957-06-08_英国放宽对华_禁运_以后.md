    After Britain Relaxes its "Embargo" Against China
    Xiao Deyi
    Britain announced on May 30th that it would independently relax trade restrictions against China, a decision that took effect on June 5th. This independent action by Britain, disregarding the opposition of the United States, has resonated widely among capitalist countries, and many countries are contemplating similar actions. Norway has already announced that it will relax trade restrictions against China in the same way as Britain.
    Before finally taking this decision, Britain had consistently attempted to reach an agreement with the United States. At the "Paris Coordinating Committee" meeting, Britain and the other thirteen participating countries in the "embargo" held a month-long negotiation with the United States. Britain advocated for the elimination of special restrictions on trade with China, so that trade restrictions against China would be the same as those against the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries. Britain's proposal was supported by almost all participating countries except the United States. However, the United States insisted on its own position, only agreeing to slightly relax the "embargo" against China, while demanding that many of the more important commodities originally on the "embargo" list for China be added to the "embargo" list for all socialist countries; in addition, it wanted to tighten the application of the so-called "exception procedure." This was effectively a method that appeared to relax the "embargo" but in reality strengthened it.
    Japan and Western European countries hope to relax the "embargo" against China, and also want to expand their trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries. In the past year or two, in order to alleviate their trade crises, Western European countries have tried to expand trade between East and West while continuing the "embargo." They have also used the "exception procedure" to export some commodities that were "embargoed." Under such circumstances, the United States wanted to increase the barriers to trade between Western European countries and the socialist camp, while refusing to provide them with more markets itself. Western European countries, for their own fundamental interests, naturally could not accept this.
    Especially Britain, which is a country that cannot survive without foreign trade. While the United States used the "embargo" to tie Britain's hands, it also treated the colonial interests of the British Empire as meat on the chopping block, fiercely squeezing Britain out of markets in Latin America, Western Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. The recently proposed "Eisenhower Doctrine" was an even greater signal of a major attack on British colonial interests. Faced with this situation, Britain has taken various measures in the past few months to fight back against the United States, attempting to reverse the decline. First, it took an independent step on the issue of disarmament, and then launched a fierce struggle with the United States on the "embargo" issue.
    The struggle between Britain and the United States on this issue not only reflects their economic contradictions, their struggle for markets and colonial interests, but also reflects their political contradictions, their struggle for dominance in the capitalist world.
    Since the Korean War, the "embargo" has been a noose around Britain's neck, harming both Britain's economy and its independent status. For several years, the British government has succumbed to the pressure of the United States, and for the sake of the "Anglo-American alliance," has never dared to break free from this constraint, repeatedly pleading for Washington's understanding. But the facts have proved that the more Britain begs for America's understanding, the more arrogant and domineering the United States becomes towards Britain. From the Suez Canal crisis to the Bermuda Conference, many Britons' illusions about Anglo-American relations were shattered. The British ruling group finally realized that the result of following the United States step by step after the war had brought Britain to the brink of bankruptcy. Therefore, this time Britain adopted an unprecedentedly firm attitude, and instead of continuing to entangle with the United States in negotiations, announced its own decision. This action by Britain, coupled with its independent action on the issue of disarmament, has, as the British ruling group hoped, raised Britain's international standing. For the United States, which is accustomed to giving orders in Western countries, this action by Britain is undoubtedly a very bitter pill to swallow. After Britain independently announced the relaxation of the "embargo," the Associated Press believed that this was "the most painful diplomatic defeat suffered by Washington since the Egyptian incident." This is quite reasonable.
    There is also one thing worth noting. As some Western newspapers have pointed out, after Britain took this action, Washington, while expressing regret, did not launch a particularly fierce attack on Britain. There are reasons for this as well. The main weapon the United States uses to force its "allies" to submit on this issue is to invoke the so-called "Battle Act," threatening to suspend US "aid." However, Britain's economic strength has recovered in recent years, and the "aid" that the United States now gives to Britain is not large, so the power of this threat is no longer so great. At the same time, Britain's position represents the common sentiment and demands of most capitalist countries. If the United States presses too hard, it will only isolate itself further. In addition, even within the United States, there has been grumbling about the US government's die-hard attitude on the "embargo" issue. Recently, some American congressmen and newspapers have complained that the US government "ignores the realities of life," "closes its windows and does not look at this market (referring to China)," and demanded a "thorough study" of US policy and an investigation into the "possibilities" of US companies trading with China. This means that the US government's insistence on the policy of "embargo" against China is not only universally opposed abroad, but also increasingly unpopular at home. Since the US government still wants to cling to the "embargo" policy to show its hostility towards our country, but lacks a sound justification and is in an extremely passive position, it is difficult for it to do more than express regret for Britain's independent decision to relax the "embargo" against China.
    As for Britain's actions, they are also incomplete. While announcing the relaxation of trade restrictions against China, it indicated that it would not completely abandon the "embargo" policy, and would remain within the so-called "China Committee." It will also negotiate with the United States on the quantity limits of certain commodities for trade with China. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also specifically stated in the House of Commons that Britain's actions "do not affect Anglo-American relations," and sent personnel from the British Embassy in the United States to explain to the United States. This shows that although Britain was forced to take some independent decisions, it is still very sensitive to the face of its "big partner." Britain still has many steps to take to achieve complete independence.
    Among other capitalist countries, some countries with more independence have taken or are preparing to take action; other countries—especially West Germany and Japan—want to act but hesitate, fearing offending their American boss. West Germany is currently building a "US-German axis," Adenauer has just returned from the United States, and it needs strong US support on many issues. Japan, due to its traditional trade relations with China, was originally one of the countries that most urgently demanded the relaxation of the "embargo," but after Britain had already acted, the Japanese government shrank back, intending to adopt a "mediating approach between the US and Britain." This also exposes that the Japanese government is still quite weak today, and still has to look to the United States on some major issues that are closely related to Japan's own interests. There are also more countries that are currently taking a wait-and-see attitude, intending to observe the developments further.
    In any case, the development of the struggle on the "embargo" issue proves a truth: the situation is stronger than people. As the dike of Washington's "embargo" bursts, a series of policy adjustments are bound to be triggered in capitalist countries. Whether Washington is willing or not, the situation will continue to develop in a direction contrary to its wishes.

    英国放宽对华“禁运”以后
    肖德义
    英国在5月30日宣布单独放宽对中国的贸易限制，这个决定已从6月5日起生效。英国这次不顾美国的反对而独立行事，在资本主义国家中引起了普遍的共鸣，许多国家正在酝酿采取类似的行动。挪威已宣布同英国一样放宽对华贸易的限制。
    英国在最后采取这个决定之先，曾经一直企图能够同美国取得协议。在“巴黎统筹委员会”会议上，英国和其他十三个参加“禁运”的国家同美国进行了整整一个月的谈判。英国主张取消对中国贸易的特殊限制，使对中国的贸易限制同对苏联和东欧各社会主义国家一样。英国的主张得到了除美国以外的几乎所有参加国的支持。但美国仍坚持它自己的主张，只同意稍稍放宽对中国的“禁运”，而要求把原来在对中国“禁运”的货单上的许多种较重要的商品，加到对所有社会主义国家“禁运”的货单上；另外还要收紧对所谓“例外程序”的运用。这实际上是一个名为放宽而实为加强“禁运”的办法。
    日本和西欧各国希望放宽对中国的“禁运”，同时也想扩大它们同苏联和东欧各人民民主国家的贸易。近一两年来，西欧各国为了缓和它们的贸易危机，曾经设法在继续“禁运”的同时，扩大东西方之间的贸易。它们还利用“例外程序”输出了一些被“禁运”的商品。在这样的情况下，美国想要增加西欧国家同社会主义阵营贸易的壁障，而自己又不愿为它们提供更多的市场，西欧国家为了本身的根本利益，自然是无法接受的。
    特别是英国，它是没有对外贸易就不能生存的国家。美国一面用“禁运”束缚英国手脚，另一面又把英帝国的殖民利益当作择肥而噬的俎上肉，它在拉丁美洲、西欧、亚洲等处市场上，都猛烈排挤英国。不久前提出的“艾森豪威尔主义”更是向英国的殖民利益大举进攻的信号。面对着这样的局面，英国在过去几个月中，采取各种方法向美国进行反击，企图挽回颓势。首先是在裁军的问题上跨出了独立的一步，接着就在“禁运”问题上同美国展开了激烈的斗争。
    英美两国在这个问题上的斗争，不仅是反映了它们在经济上的矛盾，它们的争夺市场和殖民利益方面的斗争，而且反映了它们政治上的矛盾，它们争夺在资本主义世界中的支配地位的斗争。
    自从朝鲜战争以来，“禁运”一直是美国套在英国脖子上的一根索子，既损害英国的经济，也损害英国的独立地位。几年来，英国政府屈服于美国的压力，为了“英美的同盟关系”，始终不敢摆脱这一束缚，而一再祈求华盛顿的谅解。但是事实证明，英国愈是恳求美国的谅解，美国对英国就愈是强横霸道。从苏伊士运河问题发生到百慕大会议，许多英国人对英美关系的幻想破灭了。英国统治集团也终于发现，战后亦步亦趋地追随美国的结果，已经把英国带到了破产的边缘。所以这一次英国采取了前所未有的坚定态度，而且不同美国在谈判中继续纠缠，而宣布了自己的决定。英国的这一行动，加上它在裁军问题上的独立行动，像英国统治集团所期望的，已经提高了英国在国际上的地位。对于在西方国家中习惯于发号施令的美国说来，英国这一行动无疑是一颗很难吃的丸药。英国单独宣布放宽“禁运”之后，美联社认为，这是埃及事件以来“伦敦使华盛顿在外交上受到的最沉痛的失败”。这是有相当道理的。
    还有一件值得注意的事情。像一些西方国家报纸所指出的，在英国采取这个行动之后，华盛顿虽然表示了遗憾，却没有对英国进行特别激烈的攻击。这里面也是有原因的。美国在这个问题上迫使它的“盟国”就范的武器主要是援引所谓“巴特尔法”，以停止美“援”相威胁。但是英国近年来经济实力有了恢复，而美国现在给英国的“援助”已为数不大，因此这种威胁的力量已经不那样大了。同时，英国的主张，代表了大多数资本主义国家的共同情绪和要求。美国如果压得过火，反而会使自己更加孤立。另外，即使是在美国国内，对于美国政府在“禁运”问题上的死硬态度也已啧有烦言。最近，就有一些美国议员和报纸埋怨美国政府“无视生活中的现实”、“关起窗来不看这个市场（指中国）”，并且要求“彻底研究”美国的政策和调查美国公司同中国贸易的“可能性”。这就是说，美国政府坚持对华“禁运”政策，不仅在国外遭到普遍的反对，而且在国内也日益不得人心。美国政府既然还要抱住“禁运”政策不放，以示同我国敌对，而又缺乏站得住脚的理由，陷于极度的被动，处境如此，对于英国单独决定放宽对华“禁运”虽有不满，要比表示遗憾作得更凶，也是难矣哉。
    至于英国的行动，也是不彻底的。它在宣布放宽对中国的贸易限制的同时，表明它并不全部放弃“禁运”政策，并且还将留在所谓“中国委员会”之内。它对中国贸易的某些商品，还要同美国谈判，规定数量上的限制。英国外交大臣劳埃德还在下院特地声明，英国的行动“不影响美英关系”，又派了英国驻美大使馆人员向美国进行解释。这说明了，英国虽然是逼上梁山，作出了一些独立的决定，但对它的那位“大伙计”的脸色，仍然是很敏感的。英国要达到完全独立，还得有许多步子要走。
    在其他资本主义国家中间，一些独立性比较多一点的国家，已经采取行动或准备采取行动；另一些国家——特别是西德和日本，则是欲动又罢，生怕得罪美国老板。西德是因为最近正在搞“美德轴心”，阿登纳刚从美国回来，它在许多问题上正需要美国大力支持。日本由于它对中国的传统贸易关系，本来是要求放宽“禁运”最迫切的一个国家，可是在英国已经行动起来之后，日本政府却畏缩不前，打算在美英之间采取“居间调停的方针”。这也暴露了日本政府今天还是相当软弱，在一些重大的、同日本切身利害有关的问题上，还要看美国的眼色。还有比较多的国家，现在暂时采取观望态度，打算再看一看发展。
    无论如何，在“禁运”问题上的斗争的发展，证明了一个真理：形势比人强。随着华盛顿的“禁运”堤防的决口，在资本主义国家中势必引起一系列的政策上的调整，不管华盛顿愿意不愿意，局势总是要向着同它的意愿相反的方向继续发展。
