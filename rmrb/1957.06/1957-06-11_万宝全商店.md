　　"Wanbaoquan Store"
    Yu Kangdong is a relatively small department store, originally with only two employees: the son, Liu Fengming, as the manager, and the mother as the salesperson. Because of the expanded business, the district store transferred another salesperson. Yu Kangdong is located in the first store on the east side of the north gate of Dong'an Market in Beijing. Customers who buy goods here leave the store with smiles on their faces. In the past, people called it the "Mother and Son Store," but now the masses call it the "Wanbaoquan Store" (All-Things-Available Store).
    The name "Wanbaoquan Store" has a reason. Because they deal in miscellaneous daily necessities. For example, people who buy socks in large stores come here to buy sock liners; those who buy canned food come here to buy small can openers; and those who buy towels and medicated soap also come here to buy loofah sponges to complete a set of bathing utensils. In the past year, this store has added more than 300 kinds of odd items that other stores are unwilling to handle. Even if only three or five customers need something, Liu Fengming tries to find it everywhere; if he can't find ready-made items, he designs them and has craftsmen make them, using this method to add 150 kinds of commodities that were not previously sold. Many unpopular items, such as hair frames specially used by old ladies, rice washing baskets commonly used by southerners, as well as tea strainers, and small watering cans, have been added, greatly facilitating customers. ·Sun Zunian·

　　“万宝全商店”
    豫康东是一个较小的百货商店，原来只有两个从业人员，儿子刘凤鸣是经理，母亲是售货员。因为扩大了业务，区店又调来了一个售货员。豫康东座落在北京东安市场北门靠东的第一家。凡是从这里买到物品的顾客，都是面带笑容的走出商店。过去人们称它为“母子商店”，现在群众称呼它为“万宝全商店”。
    “万宝全商店”的称呼是有来由的。因为他们经营的是零星日用杂货。如人们在大商店里买了袜子，就到这儿来买上袜底用的袜底板；买了罐头，就到这里买开罐头的小刀；买了毛巾、药皂，也要到这儿来买块丝瓜瓤子，才能凑成一套洗澡用具。这个商店在去年一年中就增添了别家不大愿意经营的零星商品三百多种。那怕是三、五个顾客所需要的东西，刘凤鸣也设法到各处寻找；寻找不到现成的东西，他就设计出样子，由手工业者代做，用这种办法添了一百五十种从前没有经营过的商品。许多冷门货，像老太太们专用的发架子，南方人使惯了的淘米箩以及茶漏子、小喷壶等都添上了，大大地便利了顾客。  ·孙祖年·
