　　The Wish of All Japanese People
　　By Tanigawa Michizi, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Hosei University, Japan

    I visited China last August and was deeply impressed. As a member of the Japanese Asian Solidarity Committee's cultural delegation, I fell ill with a stomach ulcer while traveling from India through Egypt to Greece. After having five-sixths of my stomach removed, I was unable to fully recover and arrived in China alone, two months later than the others. Therefore, I focused my sightseeing mainly on museums, ancient ruins, and so on. Even so, in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other places, I came into contact with the great aspect of new construction. I knew something about China's situation before liberation, and therefore I could not help but be even more amazed at the speed and scale of this new construction, which is progressing in many ways.
    China is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. While many other ancient civilizations have perished, China has repeatedly regained its youthful vitality and continues to maintain its great national strength. For a long time, I have had a special fondness for China's ancient artifacts, and I have always looked at this Chinese miracle with amazement. During my fourteen-day stay in China, I saw the vigorous spirit of young men and women everywhere. This made me feel even more strongly that this nation is restoring its youth on an unprecedentedly massive scale.
    Today, I don't think there is a single Japanese person who does not want to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. But why hasn't this wish of the entire nation been realized? The reason is simple and complex. This is because Japan has not yet achieved true independence, and in the current international and domestic situation in Japan, there are various important factors hindering Japan from achieving true independence. This is what I mean by the complex reason. However, as long as the will of the people is concentrated, this complex problem can be solved. The fact that the will of the people has not yet been concentrated is what I mean by the simple reason. However, the "National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations," which brings together representatives from all walks of life in the country, is about to be established, and the time is ripe.
    In short, it should be possible to fly directly from Tokyo to Beijing, but now we have to go through Hong Kong. This unnatural state cannot continue for long. In the final analysis, water always flows downwards.

### 全体日本国民的愿望

　　全体日本国民的愿望
　　日本法政大学文学院院长  谷川微之
    我在去年8月访问了中国，得到了深深的铭感。作为日本亚洲团结委员会文化代表团的一个成员，我从印度经过埃及到达希腊的时候，因胃溃疡而病倒，切除了胃的六分之五，身体尚未完全复原，比大家迟了两个月才只身到了中国。因而我把参观的目标主要放在博物馆、古代遗迹等等上面，但即使如此，在北京、上海、西安、广州等地，我还是接触到了伟大的新建设的一面。我多少了解解放前中国的一些情况，因而对于那在多方面进展着的新建设的速度之快和规模之大，就不能不更加惊叹了。
    中国是世界上最古老的文明国家之一，在其他许多古代文明国家灭亡了的今天，中国由于它几次重新取得了青春活力，迄今仍然保持着它伟大的民族力量。长久以来，我一直对中国的古代文物怀有特殊喜爱，同时我也一直用惊异的眼光看待着中国的这种奇迹。这次在中国逗留了十四天，在这段时间里，我到处看到了青年男女的蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。这更使我感到，这个民族正在空前巨大的规模上恢复着它的青春。
    在今天，我想没有一个日本人是不愿意恢复日中两国邦交的。可是，这种全体国民的愿望为什么没有实现呢？其原因说简单也很简单，说复杂也很复杂。这是由于日本还没有获得真正的独立，而在目前的国际形势和日本国内形势中，又存在着种种阻碍日本获得真正独立的重要因素，这就是我所说的复杂的理由。然而，只要国民的意志集中起来，就能够解决这个复杂的问题。而现在国民的意志还没有集中起来，这就是我说的简单的理由。不过，网罗了国民各阶层代表人士的“恢复日中邦交国民会议”即将成立，时机已近成熟了。
    总之，从东京可以直接飞向北京，而现在却必须绕道香港。这种不自然状态是不能长久继续下去的。归根到底，水总是往低处流的。
