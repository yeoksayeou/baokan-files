    Machine-Made Preliminary Red Tea Processing

    (This report) News from this newspaper: The Zhuji Red Tea Preliminary Processing Factory in Zhejiang Province has begun production. This factory can initially process 10,000 to 12,000 catties of green leaves per day. This year, it can produce 1,270 dan of dried tea. In the past, the preliminary processing of red tea produced in China was entirely done manually in tea-producing rural areas, except for the refining process, which was centrally operated with machinery in cities. As a result, the preliminary processed red tea was not only of poor quality but also of high cost. The red tea initially made by machines in this factory is of better quality, and the cost is more than 30% lower than that of manual preliminary processing.

    用机器初制红茶
    本报讯  浙江省诸暨红茶初制厂已投入生产。这个厂每天能初制青叶一万至一万二千斤。今年可生产干茶一千二百七十担。过去我国出产的红茶，除精制过程集中在城市用机械操作外，初制过程全部分散在产茶农村用手工操作。因此，初制成的红茶，不但质量差，而且成本高。这个厂初用机器制的红茶，品质既好，成本也比手工初制的低30％以上。
