Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki Dispatch, June 14th: Bulganin and Khrushchev held a press conference in Helsinki on June 13th, according to TASS.

　　Speaking about the issue of European peace at the press conference, Bulganin said that the Soviet government believes that establishing an all-European security system in which all European countries (regardless of their social systems) participate is in line with the interests of maintaining and consolidating European peace. He advocated that before the establishment of an all-European security system, an agreement should be concluded between the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty, mutually guaranteeing that all disputes will be resolved only by peaceful means and only by negotiation.

　　In this regard, Bulganin mentioned the great significance of Finland's non-participation in any of the current major power blocs, and considered that mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian countries is of great significance. He said that the Soviet Union is ready to develop comprehensive friendly relations with the Nordic countries, and that such relations should be built on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and independence, equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. Bulganin hoped that a sober policy would prevail in the Scandinavian countries, a policy that should proceed from the fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries.

　　Bulganin emphasized that the complete and unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons is an urgent task facing all countries, especially the major powers.

　　Bulganin also talked about the expansion of cultural and economic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. He pointed out that from 1950 to the present, the trade volume between the two countries has increased more than two and a half times. The total trade volume in 1956 alone reached one billion rubles.

　　Bulganin firmly believed that the Finnish people are eager for peace, and expressed the hope that President Kekkonen's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union would promote the further development of friendly ties and truly good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland.

　　Khrushchev answered questions raised by reporters at the meeting. He pointed out that the issue of disarmament can only be resolved under the conditions of mutual trust between countries, especially between major powers with relatively strong armed forces and nuclear weapons, and that no supervision can solve the problem. Because no supervision can detect hidden atomic and hydrogen weapons, nor can it detect secret production of such weapons.

　　He said that whether it is the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, or all other countries, if they do not want to stand on the path of adventurism, then they should support the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, which is the only way out.

　　Khrushchev believes that all objective possibilities now exist for reaching an agreement on disarmament and stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said: We regret that the United States and Britain oppose signing an agreement to stop testing such weapons. If setting up corresponding observation posts in the territories of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, or possibly in some other regions, can help reach an agreement on this issue, the Soviet Union is prepared to agree to do so.

　　In response to a question about convening a four-power summit, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is ready to hold such a meeting at any time and in any place. But it is still necessary to know whether the other parties are also ready to hold such a meeting and are prepared to resolve the issues that need to be adjusted.

　　A reporter from "Columbia Broadcasting System" asked Khrushchev if he would like to visit the United States. He replied that the United States is the most powerful capitalist country, and the friendly relations throughout the world depend to a large extent on whether Soviet-American relations are normal, and the Soviet Union hopes to have good contact with the United States. However, he cannot go to the United States as a traveler, nor does he intend to ask to go to the United States for a formal visit himself.

　　A reporter from the Italian "Corriere della Sera" asked what Khrushchev thought of the reactions to his own television interview. Khrushchev said that he believes the reactions are basically good and correct. The working people welcome the interview. But the reactions of those who make a fortune from the Cold War will not be good. He pointed out that some people are now distorting the meaning of the interview in order to continue to pursue the Cold War policy.

　　In answering a question about consolidating security and peace in Northern Europe, Khrushchev pointed out that Finland is making every effort it can and considers necessary for the cause of peace. But in neutral Sweden, there are currently remarks that are not conducive to easing tensions. In Norway and Denmark, there are considerable forces stubbornly advocating dividing countries into military blocs. Currently, negotiations are underway on the issue of deploying rocket weapons in Norway and Denmark. He hopes that the leaders of these countries will have enough courage to resist this bad thing.

　　Khrushchev finally talked about the German question. He reiterated that the German question can only be solved by the Germans themselves, and that others do not need to intervene. As long as the reality of the existence of two Germanys is realistically considered, and the Germans themselves conduct consultations, they will inevitably find a solution that satisfies both parties. He stated that the Soviet Union is willing to make every effort to promote the solution of the German question.

### 苏联领袖在芬兰举行记者招待会  苏联准备随时参加四国首脑会议

　　苏联领袖在芬兰举行记者招待会
　　苏联准备随时参加四国首脑会议
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫6月13日在赫尔辛基举行了记者招待会。
    布尔加宁在招待会上谈到欧洲和平问题时说，苏联政府认为建立一个所有欧洲国家（不论其社会制度如何）都参加的全欧安全体系，是符合维护和巩固欧洲和平的利益的。他主张在建立全欧安全体系以前，在北大西洋公约组织参加国和华沙条约参加国之间缔结一项协定，互相保证只用和平方法、只用谈判的方法解决一切争端。
    在这方面，布尔加宁提到芬兰不参加当前任何一个大国集团的重大意义，并且认为苏联同斯堪的纳维亚国家取得相互谅解具有重大意义。他说，苏联准备同北欧国家发展全面的友好联系，这种联系应当建筑在互相尊重国家主权和独立、平等、互不干涉内政和互利的基础上。布尔加宁希望，清醒的政策会在斯堪的纳维亚国家中占优势，这种政策应当从各国人民的根本利益出发。
    布尔加宁强调指出，彻底地毫无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器是一切国家，首先是各大国，面临的一个刻不容缓的任务。
    布尔加宁还谈到苏芬两国文化经济关系的扩大。他指出，从1950年到现在，两国的贸易额已经增加了两倍半以上。1956年一年的贸易总额达十亿卢布。
    布尔加宁坚信芬兰人民渴望和平，并且表示希望，吉科宁总统今后不久到苏联的访问会促进苏联和芬兰之间友好联系和真正睦邻关系的进一步发展。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上回答了记者所提的问题。他指出，只有在各国之间，首先是拥有比较雄厚的武装力量和核武器的大国之间，相互信任的条件下，裁减军备问题才有可能解决，而任何监督都不解决问题。因为，任何监督都不能够查出隐藏的原子武器和氢武器，也不能查出有人在秘密生产这种武器。
    他说，不论是美国、苏联、英国、法国，还是所有其他国家，假如它们不想站在冒险主义的道路上，那就应当赞成社会制度不同的各国的和平共处，这是唯一的出路。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，现在已经具备了就裁军问题达成协议和停止试验原子武器和氢武器的全部的客观可能性。他说：我们对美国和英国反对签订停止试验这种武器的协定表示遗憾。假如在苏联、美国、英国的领土上或者可能在其他某些地区内设置相应的观察哨能有助于就这个问题达成协议，苏联准备同意这样做。
    在回答有关召开四大国政府首脑会议的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联随时都准备在任何地方举行这种会晤。但是还有必要知道其他方面是否也准备举行这种会晤和准备解决有待调整的问题。
    “哥伦比亚广播公司”的记者问赫鲁晓夫是否愿意访问美国。他回答说，美国是资本主义国家中最强大的国家，全世界友好关系在很大程度上取决于苏美两国的关系是否正常，苏联希望和美国作一次良好接触。但是，他既不能作旅行家去美国，也不打算自己请求去美国作正式访问。
    意大利“晚邮报”记者问，赫鲁晓夫对他自己的电视谈话的反应有什么看法。赫鲁晓夫说，他认为反应基本是良好而正确的。劳动人民都欢迎这次谈话。但是那些靠冷战发财的人的反应是不会好的。他指出，现在有人正在曲解谈话的意思，以便继续执行冷战政策。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答关于巩固北欧的安全和和平问题时指出，芬兰正在为和平事业作出它能够作的和它认为必要作的一切努力。但是在中立国瑞典，目前有着不利于缓和紧张局势的言论。在挪威和丹麦，有相当大的势力顽固地主张把各国分成军事集团。现在就有人正在就在挪威和丹麦配置火箭武器问题举行谈判。他希望这些国家的领导人有足够的勇气来抵挡住这种坏事。
    赫鲁晓夫最后谈到德国问题。他重申，德国问题只有德国人自己能够解决，而其他人没有必要插手。只要现实地考虑到有两个德国存在，德国人自己进行协商，就必然会找到双方都满意的解决办法。他表示，苏联愿意尽一切努力促进德国问题的解决。
