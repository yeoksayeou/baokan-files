　　The Account Books Were Washed Away!
　　Gǔ Xīng
　　It is said that the account books of an agricultural production cooperative along the Xifu River in Guangdong Province were washed away by the flood.
　　The situation was like this: Before the flood came, many cadres of this agricultural cooperative blindly believed that "the dikes are strong enough, and there will be no problem." They neither reinforced the dikes nor actively improved the flood prevention organization, nor did they prepare for the measures that should be taken once the flood arrived. Under this lack of vigilance, one day in May, the flood suddenly struck. The dikes that were "strong enough" were riddled with danger. Cadres and the masses rushed to fight – concentrating all their strength on the dikes, while their "rear" was left unguarded. When the dikes breached, some agricultural implements and grain of some agricultural cooperatives were washed away by the flood, and as for the account books of the agricultural cooperative, they naturally went away with the water!
　　From this incident, it is not difficult to see that anyone who holds any blindly optimistic and complacent paralyzing ideas about flood prevention work cannot withstand the test in the face of the merciless flood; similarly, in the flood control struggle, those who only care about the dikes and not the rear, and lack a "just in case" plan, are bound to suffer.

### 账簿被水冲走了！

　　账簿被水冲走了！

    据说，广东省西福河沿岸的一个农业生产合作社的账簿被水冲走了。
    事情是这样的：在洪水未来之前，这个农业社的许多干部都盲目地认为“围堤已经够坚固的了，不会出问题”。他们既不去加固河堤，又不积极健全防汛组织，更不作洪水一旦到来所应该采取的措施的准备工作。在这种疏于戒备的情况下，5月间的一天，洪水突然袭来了。“够坚固的了”的河堤，险情遍布。干部和群众仓惶应战——把全部力量都集中在堤上，至于他们的“后方”，则无人把守。当河堤决口的时候，有些农业社的农具和粮食被洪水冲跑了，至于农业社的账簿，自然也顺水而去！
    从这件事情，不难看出：对于防汛工作抱有任何盲目乐观和自满麻痹思想的人，在无情的洪水面前，是经不起考验的；同样，在防洪斗争中，只顾河堤，不顾后方，缺乏“万一”打算的人们，也是必然要吃苦头的。
