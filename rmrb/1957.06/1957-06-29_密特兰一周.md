A Week in the Midlands
　　4. They Hope to Trade with China

　　Some people compare Coventry to Stalingrad. Because it is not only a famous industrial city in Britain, but also suffered the most violent bombing by the Nazis during the Second World War. We took the opportunity to visit the Forking Tractor Company and toured the central area of ​​Coventry. Here, there is no trace of the war now. A naked statue of a woman stands in the city center square. She rides a steed, her long hair hanging down to her knees. The square is surrounded by newly built department stores, magnificent restaurants and hotels...

　　As our car passed the square, Tao, a young employee of Forking Company, told the following story:

　　Once upon a time, there was a duke in Coventry who levied excessive taxes and exploited the peasants until they had nothing left but bones. The peasants felt that it was better to die than to live.

　　The young and beautiful Duchess advised her husband to reduce taxes. The greedy Duke came up with a difficult problem:

　　"If you ride a horse naked through the city, I will reduce the taxes accordingly."

　　The next day, a young noblewoman appeared on the streets of Coventry. She wore not a thread of clothing, not a strip of cloth. She let her beautiful long hair fall to her chest, to her legs, covering her body, and galloped away...

　　The Duke regretted his rash promise, but it was too late. He had to reduce the taxes.

　　Perhaps this is a story imagined by people. But the people of Coventry would rather regard her as a real person and sculpt a statue for this brave and kind woman.

　　After telling this story, Tao gave us a teasing wink:

　　"Today, if we all marched naked, the Conservative government would not reduce taxes. This is the 'progress' of the times."

　　The car drove past the square, through several streets, and soon arrived at the Forking Company in the suburbs. Like most British enterprises, the office is built very simply and plainly. The office of Spencer, the general manager of the export department, only has a table and three chairs. However, he does business with 118 countries around the world.

　　Spencer visited China last year. As soon as we met, he put his hands around his belly, pretending to have a big belly, indicating that he had received the best hospitality in Beijing. As a result of this visit, a contract for 100 tractors was signed. He and we both think this is a "good start".

　　Spencer insisted that we look at their training class first, and then visit the factory. Forking Company has 16 factories at home and abroad, and it controls 50% of the agricultural machinery production in the United Kingdom. In the capitalist world, besides the American "Agricultural Machinery Company", Forking is the largest tractor company. The former monopolizes the North and South American markets; the latter monopolizes most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Southeast Asian markets. The factory we visited was the tractor workshop of Standard Motor Company, which specializes in production for Forking Company, because Forking controls 20% of the shares of Standard Motor Company. As for the training class, it is said that this is a "feature" of Forking Company's business: they train craftsmen for countries that buy tractors; in addition, the company also runs a newspaper with a circulation of 120,000 copies. All this is to "develop business".

　　We finally "compromised": to go to the training class. This small-scale school is located in an old manor house far from the city. Nearby are towering trees, shrouded in poetic tranquility. The trainees here come from various countries—from Northern Europe to South Africa, from Australia and New Zealand to Southeast Asia. The complexity of the学员 nationalities reflects the scale of Forking's trade. There are 100,000 Forking tractors working on farms in the Scandinavian Peninsula; Iceland, where agriculture is not developed - 1,000; India - 10,000. 100% of the tractors used in Ceylon are Forking. The prosperous business has brought generous profits: last year alone, Forking's dividends reached 7 million pounds, a figure far exceeding the total profits of 1,600 textile factories of all sizes in the Lancashire region.

　　In the open space of the training class, Tao sat on a tractor. We soon discovered that this young man not only had the talent to tell stories vividly, but also was good at persuading others. He held the steering wheel with his left hand, and raised his right hand with his index finger, making a gesture asking us to pay attention:

　　"Look, this is the slowest speed!"

　　The wheels of the tractor turned slowly.

　　The same gesture again: "Look, this is the second speed!"

　　The wheels turned a little faster.

　　"Look!..." He performed again and again until he had completed six different speeds.

　　By the end of the day's visit, Tao had almost convinced us that Forking's tractors were the best in the world.

　　Before leaving Forking Company, Spencer, the general manager of the export department, had an hour-long conversation with us. They now produce 300 tractors a day (excluding other agricultural machinery). Soon, some automated machines will be used, and the output will be increased to 500 vehicles per day. Expanded productivity requires opening up new markets. If Tao has successfully given us a good impression of Forking's tractors, then in Spencer's conversation, he clearly expressed his willingness to trade with China.

　　Spencer asked straight to the point: How are the tractors shipped to Beijing being used?

　　We replied: It is being tested, and we hope to get satisfactory conclusions. China has such a vast territory that what can be used in the north may not be suitable in the south...

　　"We are producing tractors for paddy fields," Spencer immediately recommended. "We produce all kinds of tractors to suit the different natural conditions of various countries." Then, he handed us a clipping. This is a message from the Hong Kong South China Morning Post: "According to the estimate of the general manager of the export department of Forking Company, China will purchase tractors worth 378 million pounds in the next ten years. ...He is negotiating with Chinese officials..."

　　When we returned to London, the British government happened to announce the relaxation of the "embargo" against China. The next day, we saw the following report in the newspaper:

　　"Large tractor companies, truck companies and machinery manufacturers have taken action to inquire with the Ministry of Trade about trade issues with China. It is believed here that the first to visit the Ministry of Trade to obtain detailed information was Spencer, the export manager of Forking Company..." (To be continued)

　　密特兰一周
　　四、他们希望同中国贸易
    有人把考文垂比作斯大林格勒。因为它不仅是英国著名的工业城市，而且在第二次世界大战期间，遭到了纳粹最猛烈的轰炸。我们借参观福克兴拖拉机公司之便，游览了考文垂的中心区。在这儿，现在已经看不到战争的遗迹。一座赤身裸体的妇女雕像，竖立在市中心广场。她骑着骏马，长长的头发一直垂到膝间。广场四周是战后新建的百货公司、华丽的餐厅和旅馆……。
    当我们的汽车经过广场的时候，福克兴公司的年轻职员陶，讲了这样一个故事：
    从前，考文垂有个公爵，横征暴敛，把农民剥削得只剩下一把骨头。农民觉得死了比活着还好。
    年轻美丽的公爵夫人，劝她的丈夫减轻赋税。贪馋无比的公爵出了一道难题：
    “如果你光着身子骑马在城里跑一趟，我就照减。”
    第二天，一个年轻的贵妇人，在考文垂的街头出现了。她没有穿一丝衣服，没有佩一根布带。她把美丽的长发垂到胸前，垂到腿间，遮盖着自己的身体，策马驰去……。
    公爵后悔自己轻率地许下诺言，但是已经晚了。他不得不把赋税减轻。
    也许这是人们想像出来的故事。但考文垂人宁愿把她当作实有其人，为这勇敢、善良的妇女塑制了雕像。
    讲完这个故事，陶向我们投了个戏谑的眼色：
    “今天，我们全都光着屁股去游行，保守党政府也不会减轻税收的。这就是时代的‘进步’”。
    汽车驶过广场，穿过几条街道，很快就到了郊区的福克兴公司。像大多数的英国企业一样，办公室建筑得非常朴素和简单。出口部总经理斯潘塞尔的房间里，只摆着一张桌子和三把座椅。可是，他同全世界一百十八个国家作着买卖。
    斯潘塞尔在去年到过中国。一见面，他就把两手环抱起来，装出一个大肚子的模样，表示在北京受到了最好的款待。作为这次访问的结果，是签订了成交一百辆拖拉机的合同。他和我们都认为这是个“很好的开端”。
    斯潘塞尔坚持要我们先看看他们的训练班，然后再参观工厂。福克兴公司在国内外有十六个工厂，它控制了英国农业机器生产的50％。在资本主义世界，除了美国的“农业机器公司”以外，福克兴是最大的拖拉机公司。前者垄断着南北美洲市场；后者垄断着西欧的绝大部分、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非和东南亚的市场。我们参观的工厂，是标准汽车公司的拖拉机车间，它专为福克兴公司生产，因为福克兴控制了标准汽车公司20％的股份。至于训练班，据说这是福克兴公司业务上的一个“特色”：他们为购买拖拉机的国家训练工匠；除此以外，这个公司还办了一个报纸，销数达十二万份。这一切，都是为“开展业务”服务的。
    我们终于“妥协”了：到训练班去。这个小规模的学校，设在远离城市的一座旧时的地主庄园里。附近都是参天的大树，笼罩着富有诗意的静穆。在这儿受训练的，来自各个不同的国家——从北欧到南非，从澳、新到东南亚。学员国籍的庞杂，反映了福克兴贸易的规模。在斯堪的纳维亚半岛的农庄里，有十万辆福克兴拖拉机工作着；农业并不发达的冰岛——一千辆；印度——一万辆。锡兰使用的拖拉机，百分之百是福克兴的。兴隆的买卖，带来了丰厚的利润：去年一年，福克兴的红利达七百万英镑，这个数字远远超过了兰开夏地区大小一千六百家纺织厂的利润的总和。
    在训练班的空地上，陶坐到一架拖拉机上。我们很快发现，这个年轻人不仅有生动地讲述故事的才能，而且善于说服别人。他左手握着方向盘，高举的右手竖起食指，作了个要求我们注意的姿势：
    “瞧，这是最慢的速度！”
    拖拉机的轮子缓缓转动。
    又是同样的姿势：“瞧，这是第二种速度！”
    轮子转得稍快一些。
    “瞧！……”一次又一次地表演，直到做完了六种不同的速度。
    当一天参观结束的时候，陶几乎使我们相信：福克兴的拖拉机是世界上最好的拖拉机。
    在离开福克兴公司以前，出口部总经理斯潘塞尔同我们作了一小时的谈话。他们现在日产三百辆拖拉机（不包括别的农业机器）。不久以后，将采用一部分自动化的机器，产量要提高到每天五百辆。扩大了的生产力，要求开辟新的市场。如果说，陶已成功地使我们对福克兴的拖拉机有了个好印象，那末在斯潘塞尔的谈话中，他明显地表示了要求同中国进行贸易的意愿。
    斯潘塞尔开门见山地问：运到北京去的拖拉机使用得怎么样。
    我们回答：正在试用，希望能得出满意的结论。中国的幅员这样广阔，在北方能用的，在南方就不一定合适……。
      “我们正在生产水田用的拖拉机，”斯潘塞尔马上推荐。“我们生产各种各样的拖拉机，适应各个国家不同的自然条件。”接着，他递给我们 一份剪报。这是香港南华早报的消息：“据福克兴公司出口部总经理估计，中国在今后十年内要购买价值三亿七千八百万英镑的拖拉机。……他正在和中国官方谈判中……。”
    当我们回到伦敦的时候，正巧英国政府宣布放宽对中国的“禁运”。第二天，我们在报纸上看到了这样的报道：
    “大拖拉机公司、卡车公司和机器制造商，已行动起来，到贸易部探询对中国的贸易问题。此间认为，第一个访问贸易部，以获得详细情报的，是福克兴公司的出口部经理斯潘塞尔……。”　（未完待续）
