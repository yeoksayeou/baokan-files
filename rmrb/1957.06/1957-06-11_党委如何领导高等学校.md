How the Party Committee Leads Universities
Beijing Geological Institute Professor Xue Qin Fang

    There is no doubt that universities need the leadership of the Party. The Party can lead us to build a socialist society, and it can also lead us to develop science, culture, and education. The Party's policies are basically correct. It is just that our Party committee comrades have committed "three isms" (bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism) in the process of implementing policies, which has led to deviations. The Party's leadership and the Party committee's work style should be viewed separately.

    I believe that the leadership of the Party committee should include the following three aspects:

    First, correctly implement the Party's policies;

    Second, ensure teaching conditions;

    Third, inspect the implementation of policies.

    The Party committee should always focus on these issues. As for issues such as professional settings, teaching plans, improving teaching quality, and scientific research, the academic committee and teaching and research sections should be trusted. Teachers should be boldly allowed to discuss them, and their professional expertise should be fully trusted. Administrative work such as personnel and finance should be discussed by the university affairs meeting (including teaching and administrative aspects). This can give full play to the enthusiasm of people at all levels, rather than having everything first discussed and decided by the Party committee, and then taken to the university academic committee for approval.

    The old university's professor-led management had great shortcomings and was heavily sectarian. I disagree with it. I think that on the one hand, we must ensure the Party's leadership, and on the other hand, we must give full play to the role of the university academic conference and the university affairs meeting, and conduct effective democratic discussions on various issues of scientific research, teaching, and administration.

    The Party committee should fully trust intellectuals and non-Party members. Now the leadership work of the school goes down from the Party committee line, as if it is believed that non-Party members cannot understand the real situation and non-Party members cannot keep secrets. The dean directly asks Party member teaching assistants to study problems, and after making a decision, he asks the department head to listen to opinions. This approach is inappropriate. This is a distrust of senior intellectuals and non-Party members. After the anti-spy campaign, the Party committee transferred some students and a teaching assistant from the Department of Geophysical Prospecting without carefully discussing it with me. This approach was very inappropriate. This distrustful attitude towards young students and teaching assistants is very bad. The school should actively cultivate young people and educate them more from a positive perspective, instead of casually transferring them away with a distrustful attitude, leaving them with an ideological burden forever. Also, comrades from Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the Physics Teaching and Research Section also said, to what extent do you trust us? Under this pressure of not being fully trusted, they are unable to fully play their role. I believe that although some people have poor family backgrounds, if they are sincerely working hard for the socialist cause, the Party committee should fully trust them.

    The Party committee should earnestly implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, boldly let go, and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, especially words that are unpleasant to the ear. When the Party committee assigns tasks, do not simply assign tasks from above and force orders, so that the following develop a blind obedience to the superiors and blindly trust the decisions of the superiors without thinking. The Party committee should encourage everyone to think independently and dare to raise different opinions. The Party committee's leadership should persuade people with reason and rely on correct principles, rather than simply relying on Party discipline to restrain Party members and Youth League members, or relying on the Party's prestige to subdue the masses. The education of young students should also be the same. At present, the leadership of the school's Youth League Committee is not strong, the level is not high, and the ability is not enough. As the secretary of the Youth League Committee with more than 5,000 students, he should have a fairly high level of Marxism-Leninism within the Party and be a comrade who can serve as a model for young students in his profession. Now the Youth League Committee is only completing the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and the students are blindly "mobilized" to carry them out. We should cultivate students to use their brains, think independently, and distinguish right from wrong, instead of blindly obeying.

    The Party committee should earnestly implement the Party's higher education policy, improve teaching quality, and cultivate students' independent working ability. Therefore, all administrative measures of the school should create conditions for teaching, rather than teaching serving to complete certain administrative measures. The school's personnel work is to complete teaching, and manpower should be allocated according to actual needs. However, the comrades in our personnel department always sit in the office to deduct percentage figures, as if the smaller the percentage, the better the personnel work is done. Our teaching and research section needed to add six teachers last year, but the personnel department arbitrarily reported only two to the Ministry of Higher Education, and even lied to us that they had reported six, and the ministry only approved two. As a result, physics experiments and homework classes were changed from small classes to large classes, and teaching quality was reduced. Teaching assistants in the teaching and research section should also be supplemented according to teaching needs, and should not be reduced too much. The report on the study of Soviet higher education mentioned that the physics teaching and research section of a certain Soviet engineering institute (with about 8,000 students) had 32 teaching assistants, which was entirely based on the actual needs of teaching. I believe that personnel work should not be sitting in the office studying historical materials to determine the fate of a cadre, but should go deep into the grassroots to understand the actual activities of the cadre in order to select outstanding people and meet teaching needs.

    Our school always emphasizes unified leadership and centralizes everything. The Party committee's centralism is very strong. The carpenters who make teaching models in the laboratory, the metalworkers who repair instruments, and the draftsmen in the teaching and research section must all leave the laboratory and teaching and research section and concentrate in the administrative office area. This is completely not from the perspective of teaching, but from the perspective of administrative management "having power." Some problems have not been fully discussed, and the dean issues a single order. I think this style must be changed, the role of the grassroots should be actively brought into play, and centralization should be implemented only after democratic discussion.

    Our school leaders do not pay enough attention to basic courses, which is specifically reflected in the workload of teachers. Teachers of basic courses bear a heavier workload than teachers of professional courses. How can we improve teaching quality and teacher level with such a heavy burden? This is also reflected in the use of funds. The school's funds have always been used on key areas, and the key teaching and research sections (designated by the dean) are mostly professional courses, with no share for basic courses. The Party committee must recognize that geological engineers cannot be well trained without strengthening basic knowledge training. In particular, geophysical prospecting majors must have a strong foundation in science, and there must be basic course teachers with high scientific levels and basic course laboratories equipped with instruments. Only in this way can we help the geophysical prospecting teaching and research section develop smoothly in teaching and scientific research.

　　党委如何领导高等学校
　　北京地质学院教授  薛琴访
    高等学校需要党的领导是毫无疑问的，党能领导我们建设社会主义社会，就能领导我们发展科学、文化和教育事业。党的方针政策基本上是正确的。只是我们的党委同志在执行政策的过程中犯了“三个主义”（官僚，主观，宗派主义），因此就产生了偏差。党的领导和党委的作风应该分开来看。
    我认为党委会的领导应该包括这样三个内容：
    第一，正确贯彻党的方针政策；
    第二，保证教学条件；
    第三，检查方针政策执行情况。
    党委应该经常抓住这些问题。至于专业设置，教学计划，提高教学质量，科学研究等问题，则应该相信学术委员会和教研室，大胆放手地让教师们去讨论，充分信任他们的业务专长，至于人事财务等行政工作应由院务会议（包括教学和行政各方面的人）讨论。这样才能发挥各级人员的积极性，而不是事事都先经党委会讨论作出决定，然后拿到院学术委员会上去通过。
    旧大学的教授治校，有很大缺点，宗派主义很重，我不同意。我觉得一方面要保证党的领导，一方面要充分发挥院学术会议和院务会议的作用，对科学研究、教学、行政各种问题进行切实有效的民主讨论。
    党委对知识分子和党外人士要充分信任。现在学校领导工作是从党委一条线下去的，好像认为非党员不能了解真实情况，非党员不能保密。院长直接找党员助教研究问题，等作了决定后，再找系主任去听取意见，这种作法是不恰当的，这是对高级知识分子、非党人士不信任。肃反运动后，党委把物理探矿系一部分学生和一位助教作了调动，没有和我仔细商量，充分讨论，这种作法很不妥当。对青年学生和助教这种不信任的态度是非常不好的。学校应该积极培养青年，多从正面去教育他们，而不应以不信任的态度，随便把他们调走，让他们永远背上一个思想包袱。还有物理教研室，从广州香港来的同志们也说，对我们究竟信任到什么程度？在这种得不到完全信任的压力下，缩手缩脚，是不能充分发挥作用的。我认为有些人虽然家庭出身不好，但如果本人是忠心耿耿为社会主义事业而努力的，党委就应充分信任他们。
    党委要切实贯彻百家争鸣的方针，大胆的放，要虚心听取群众的意见，特别是逆耳之言。党委布置工作时不要单纯从上面布置任务，强迫命令，使下面养成盲目服从上级的盲从思想，不加思考地信赖上级的决定。党委应当发挥大家独立思考，鼓励大家敢于提出不同意见。党委领导要以理服人，要靠正确原则，而不是单纯靠党的纪律来约束党团员，凭党的威信来压服群众，对青年学生的教育也应该如此。目前学校的团委会领导是不强的，水平不高，能力不够。作为五千多学生的团委书记，应当是党内马列主义水平相当高的，并且是业务上能够作为青年学生榜样的同志。现在团委会只是完成上级布置的任务，而学生则是盲目的被“发动”去执行。我们应该培养学生动脑筋，独立思考，辨明是非，而不是盲目服从。
    党委应该切实贯彻党的高教方针，提高教学质量，培养学生独立工作能力。因此学校一切行政措施应该为教学创造条件，而不是教学为了完成某种行政措施而服务。学校的人事工作是为了完成教学，应该按实际需要来配备人力，而我们的人事处的同志老是坐在办公室内扣比例数字，似乎比例数愈减少，人事工作就作得愈好。我们教研室去年需要增加六位教师，人事处却自作主张，仅向高教部报两名，还骗我们说报了六名，部里只批准了两名，结果物理实验和习题课都从小班改成大班，教学质量降低。教研室教学辅助人员，也应按教学需要来补充，不要过于缩减。苏联高等教育考查报告中谈到，苏联某工学院（学生约八千人）物理教研室有三十二个教学辅助人员，这完全是从教学的实际需要出发的。我认为人事工作不应该是坐在办公室内研究历史材料来决定一个干部的命运，而是要深入基层去了解干部的现实活动来选拔优秀，满足教学需要。
    我们学校总是强调统一领导，什么都要集中，党委的中央集权思想很厉害。实验室作教学模型的木工，修配仪器的金工，教研室的绘图员，都要脱离实验室教研室集中到行政办公区去。这完全不是从教学出发，而是从行政管理“有权”来考虑问题。有些问题没有充分讨论，院长就一个手令。我认为必须改变这种作风，应积极发挥基层作用，集中也应该经过民主讨论才能执行。
    我们学校领导，对基础课很不够重视，具体表现在教师工作量上。基础课教师担负工作量比专业课重，压这么重又怎样提高教学质量和教师水平呢？这还表现在经费使用上。学校经费向来是重点使用，重点教研室（由院长指定）多半是专业课，没有基础课的份。党委要认识到，不加强基础知识训练是培养不好地质工程师的。特别是地球物理勘探各专业，必须有很强的基础科学，要有科学水平较高的基础课教师和仪器设备充实的基础课实验室。这样才能帮助物探专业教研室在教学上和科学研究上顺利的发展。
