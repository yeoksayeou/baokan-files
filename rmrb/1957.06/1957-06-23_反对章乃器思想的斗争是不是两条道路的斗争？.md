　　Is the Struggle Against Zhang Naiqi's Thought a Struggle Between Two Roads?
　　Tang Di Yin, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association

　　The rightists' anti-Party leadership and anti-socialist arguments are concentrated in the industrial and commercial circles and are expressed in Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks that oppose Marxism-Leninism with revisionism. However, for an industrialist and businessman, it is not simple to recognize the essence of such a problem—that is, whether it is a struggle between two roads? It is necessary to go through repeated ideological struggles to gradually improve. At the beginning, I only felt that some of Zhang Naiqi's arguments were wrong, at most only "absurd"; moreover, I felt that some of his words were not entirely unreasonable! Therefore, I was very surprised when I heard that he was a rightist, that he was reactionary, and that this was a struggle between two roads. I felt a bit doubtful, wondering if the "label" was too big? After participating in various meetings for several days and studying many articles in the newspapers, I was enlightened. It proved that my doubts, swaying, and even thinking that some of his words were not bad were mainly due to the negative side of my bourgeois duality playing a role; however, it must also be affirmed that the positive side is constantly growing, especially when personally involved in such a heated real struggle, constantly being tempered and tested, and constantly arming my mind.
　　Zhang Naiqi's remarks have a market in our industrial and commercial circles. I do not deny this, precisely because his methods are vicious. He opposes socialism under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. He uses "honeyed poison." His words are flowery and strike the depths of the industrial and commercial circles' hearts. He seizes the weaknesses of the industrial and commercial circles' vacillation. He grasps the industrial and commercial circles' fear of hearing "transformation" and "exploitation." He uglifies the working class and beautifies the bourgeoisie, praising the capitalists so highly that they are no different in essence from the workers, and therefore do not need essential transformation, etc. He does everything to anesthetize, incite, provoke, and alienate, which happens to "hit it off" with the negative side of our essence, that is, the resonance of class feelings. As one comrade said: "Our acceptance of socialist transformation is as painful as quitting opium. It is hard to quit, but someone comes to seduce you again. You smell the fragrance, knowing it is poisonous, and you become addicted again." Therefore, we are poisoned without even knowing it, still feeling it is sweet. Now, to refute him, we must first peel off his skin (the outer socialist skin) and extract his tendons (the inner capitalist tendons). He once threatened us, asking if we would be skinned and have our tendons extracted after "transformation." Today, I want to extract his tendons and peel off his skin, so that everyone can see what exactly he is!
　　My level is very low, especially in political theory. In Zhang Naiqi's eyes, my refutation of his arguments may be "an egg hitting a stone." But I have great confidence because I am sitting in the seat of socialism, while he is sitting in the seat of capitalism. Therefore, he is the egg, and I am the stone. On the 17th of this month, at the joint meeting between the Central China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Standing Committee, I refuted him in front of Zhang Naiqi. Based solely on Zhang Naiqi's remarks at the joint meeting on the 15th (see the reports on the 16th), I raised ten points. I believe that these ten points can prove that Zhang Naiqi's roads all lead to capitalism. Isn't this a struggle between two roads?
　　First, he began by saying: He is very grateful for everyone's enthusiastic help, but logically speaking, they cannot convince him. I said: What kind of logic should be clarified, otherwise, we can talk thousands of words and you would not accept it, I said first you have to move your ass over, to the seat of socialism, you would not feel our words are incompatible.

　　Second, he said: The confusion in the ideology of the industrial and commercial circles was not provoked by him, but "bloomed" from the "blooming and contending". He said that the timing should be calculated, not after these few articles of his. I said: It was influenced by his provocation. Taking myself as an example, the time should be calculated at least from 1955 (it is said that he has a series of consistent reactionary thoughts with a history). At the China Democratic National Construction Association Congress, he proposed the "red bourgeoisie". Last year, at the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association, he proposed that the bourgeoisie no longer has duality. In addition to speaking in Shanghai, and at the China Democratic National Construction Association's propaganda and education and industrial and commercial tutoring work meetings, etc., he always seizes every opportunity to release capitalist toxins. This time, taking advantage of the Party's rectification "blooming and contending" opportunity to try to open a gap, because he used honeyed poison, and he is also a leader in our industrial and commercial circles, one of the heads of the Central China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Minister of Food, and was one of the "Seven Gentlemen" in the past, with great reputation and high status, and each of us has different degrees of negativity that will act up, how can we not blur right and wrong and lose our way? Moreover, he also supports negative and backward elements. Someone in our Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Political School had grievances against the Party, wrote satirical poems and wrote letters to Zhang Naiqi. He did not help him analyze them properly, but encouraged him to describe the Party as completely dark. There are still some people who regard all theories as "dogmas" and all righteous anti-criticism as "labeling." Isn't this confrontational sentiment provoked by him?
　　Third, he said: He does not admit that it is a struggle between two roads. He said that today, after the revolution has been victorious and the constitution has been promulgated, there will not be any problems with the leadership's line. I said, the Constitution clearly stipulates that the working class is the leader, and you are denying the existence of class relations, that is, denying the leadership of the working class, aren't you trying to amend the Constitution?
　　Fourth, he said: Complaining is one thing, whether leadership is needed is another. Theoretical issues should be distinguished from political issues. I said: Theory cannot be separated from politics, theory serves politics, and theory should have a position. Moreover, he also pulled in the complaints of farmers, as well as the idealist thoughts of religious circles and ethnic minorities, to carry out more extensive and vicious provocations. His meaning is that if his remarks are regarded as reactionary, then the people mentioned above are also problems of two roads. I said: Some farmers complain, and the religious circles are idealists, etc., but their wishes are the same as ours, that is, they accept the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, and the road is also the same—the socialist road, which is different from your anti-Party and anti-socialist nature.
　　Fifth, he said: He did not say that the bourgeoisie has no duality. He believes that duality is mainly in ideological style, not in essence. I said: He clearly said at the Second Plenary Session that there is no duality. Now, although he admits that there is duality, he takes words out of context and distorts Chairman Mao's words, saying that any class has duality, and any class needs to be transformed. Therefore, he said that this is not essential, but the same as the workers, it is duality in ideological style, not essential. Isn't this clearly blurring class consciousness and negating class relations?
　　Sixth, he repeatedly emphasized that the relationship between leaders and the led can only be a relationship between the advanced and the backward. I said: According to your argument, the bourgeois elements are the same as the working class, there is no essential difference, and there are advanced and backward among the workers, and there are also advanced and backward among the bourgeois elements, that is to say, the advanced bourgeois elements can also lead the working class, isn't this clearly denying the leadership of the working class?

　　Seventh, he said: The relationship between classes and class elements should be different. This is the difference between the collective and the individual. He also said what is the difference between quantity and quality, and also said that people can be transformed, and classes are to be eliminated. These seemingly right but actually wrong words are really easy to blur our minds. That day, I said: The activities of class elements when they are scattered are "exploitation", and when they become specific organized groups, they are also "exploitation". There is no difference between exploitation at all, but he insists that the exploitative nature of the class is innate, and the exploitation of the elements is non-essential, but acquired, isolating and separating the class and the elements. Then is the class empty? What is the content of the class? The class is definitely composed of class elements. If the class elements do not have the essence of exploitation, then where does the essential foundation of the class come from? The motive for him to emphasize that there is a difference between class elements and classes, in addition to saying that the bourgeois elements and workers are exactly the same, and the leadership of the working class is not needed, what else is there? As for the fact that classes are to be eliminated and people can be transformed, I said that this precisely illustrates the correctness and greatness of our Party and state's implementation of the peaceful transformation policy. This is another matter. After the bourgeoisie is eliminated, the name of bourgeois elements will of course be completely eliminated. Now the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, the class struggle has basically ended, but the capitalist ownership has not been completely changed, exploitation still exists, classes still exist, and of course elements still exist.

　　Eighth, he said: The "walls" and "ditches" were caused by the side effects left over from past struggles. I said, if there was no "Three-Anti" campaign, would we allow cadres to be corrupt, without the "Five-Anti" campaign, would we allow capitalists' "five poisons" to run rampant, and without the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" campaign, would we allow counter-revolutionaries to restore their power? Without these struggles, it would be impossible to build socialism. Of course, it cannot be denied that there were deviations and side effects, but are these the main ones? I was severely criticized during the "Five-Anti" campaign, and I was dissatisfied at the time, but the criticism was about the "five poisons". After being cleared, I gained more trust from the people and moved closer to the Party. Many friends in the industrial and commercial circles said the same as me: Without the "Five-Anti" education, we would not be able to enter socialist society.
　　Ninth, he said: The main shortcomings of the industrial and commercial circles now are negativity and inferiority. We must give the industrial and commercial circles equal personality, and persuade them instead of suppressing them. I said: It is right that the current shortcomings of the industrial and commercial circles are negativity and inferiority. There are objective reasons, but there are also subjective reasons. Subjectively, the main reason is that the negative side is playing a role, and Zhang Naiqi keeps saying that he wants to mobilize all positive factors in the industrial and commercial circles, but we need to ask, is it the positive factors of capitalism? Or the positive factors of socialism? Because he is praising the superiority of capitalism, saying that bureaucratism is more dangerous than capitalism, as if bureaucratism is a product of the socialist system. We are rectifying the style now, don't you know? As for the equal personality, the industrial and commercial circles have a certain proportion from the central government to the local government, and industrial and commercial people hold important positions in governments at all levels, isn't this equal? Have you forgotten that you could only be in prison under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and isn't it equal that you are now a minister? Is it only equal if Chairman Mao lets you? In the end, is it right to think it's not equal when the working class leads? As for suppression: we beat gongs and drums, asking for joint state-private ownership, asking for learning, asking to abandon fixed interest. Is this persuasion? Or suppression?
　　Tenth, the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and industrial and commercial circles across the country have expressed their indignation and unanimously severely refuted the reactionary remarks of rightists such as Chu Anping and Zhang Bojun. You have shown meticulous care and sympathy, and even ridiculed Zhang Bojun's ancestors as surrender generals (do you want him not to surrender to the Communist Party and be reactionary to the end?), saying that they had reviewed too early, and defending their reactionary remarks. The people of the whole country want to draw a clear line with them, but you are supporting them, isn't this a struggle between two roads?
　　Therefore, I say, friends in the industrial and commercial circles! Our minds must be clear, our eyes must be bright, and we must no longer be deceived and anesthetized. We are determined to take the socialist road, and we hope to smoothly pass through the transition period and become glorious laborers in a socialist society.

　　反对章乃器思想的斗争是不是两条道路的斗争？
　　民建上海市副主任委员　汤蒂因
    右派的反对党的领导反对社会主义的论调，在工商界集中表现在章乃器的以修正主义来反对马列主义的反动言论。但是作为一个工商业者来讲，要认识这样一个问题的实质，——也就是究竟是不是两条道路的斗争问题？这是不简单的，必需要经过反复的思想斗争，才能逐步提高。我在开始就是只觉得章乃器有些论点不对，最多也只不过是“荒谬”；何况其中有些话我还觉得不能说绝无道理呢！因此说他是右派，说他是反动，说这是两条道路斗争的问题，我是大吃一惊的，觉得还有些怀疑，是不是“帽子”太大？经过几天来参加各种会议，以及在报上学习了不少文章，所得到的启发，证明我的所以还会怀疑，摇摆，甚至还认为他有些话还不错，这主要是由于我的资产阶级两面性中消极性的一面在作祟；可是也必须肯定积极一面是在不断地增长，尤其是亲身投入到这样火热的现实的斗争中，随时在锻炼和考验，也随时在武装自己的头脑。
    章乃器的言论在我们工商界有市场，这我不否认，正因为他的手段毒辣，是挂了马列主义的旗帜来反对社会主义，他用的是“蜜汁砒霜”，他的话是花言巧语，打中工商界的心灵深处，他抓住了工商界摇摆的弱点，他掌握了工商界怕听“改造”“剥削”，他丑化工人阶级，美化资产阶级，把资本家捧得高高的与工人已经没有本质的区别，因此也就不需要脱胎换骨的本质改造等等，是极尽了麻醉、煽动、挑拨、离间的能事，恰巧与我们本质上的消极性的一面“一拍即合”，也就是阶级感情的共鸣。正如有位同志说：“我们接受社会主义改造，真像抽鸦片的戒烟一样的痛苦，好不容易戒掉了，但是人家又来勾引你，闻得香味，明明知道是毒的，又会去上瘾了”。因此我们中了毒还不知道，还觉得是甜蜜蜜的，现在我们要驳斥他，首先就要剥他的皮（外面社会主义的皮），要抽他的筋（里面资本主义的筋）。他曾经恫吓我们“脱胎换骨”后是否还要抽筋剥皮，我今天却要抽他的筋，剥他的皮，剥开来才可以使大家看看到底是什么？
    我是水平很低的，尤其是政治理论水平，在章乃器眼光里看来，我要驳斥他的论点，可能是“鸡蛋碰石子”。可是我很有信心，因为我是坐在社会主义的位子上，而他是坐在资本主义的位子上，因此他是鸡蛋，而我是石子。本月17日那天我就在民建中央和工商联常委会联席会议上，当了章乃器的面，加以驳斥，我单根据章乃器在15日在两会联席会议上所发表的话（见16日各报）提出十条，我认为这十条都可以证明章乃器是条条道路通向资本主义，这还不是两条道路的斗争是什么呢？
    一、他开始就说：大家对他的帮助热情他很感激，但从道理来说，不能说服他。我说：这是什么道理应该明确，否则我们讲了千言万语你也是不会接受的，我说首先你要把屁股移转过来，要到社会主义的位子上来，你就不会觉得我们的话是格格不入了。
    二、他说：工商界思想混乱，不是他挑拨起来的，是“鸣”“放”出来的，他说要算时间，不是在他这几篇文章之后的。我说：是受了你的挑拨影响，算时间以我本人来讲，至少是在1955年开始（据说他是一系列有历史的一贯的反动思想）。民建会员代表大会时他提出“红色资产阶级”，去年在民建二中全会又提出资产阶级已没有两面性了，加上到上海来讲话，以及在民建宣教，工商辅导工作会议等等总是抓住每一个机会要放射资本主义毒素。这次乘党整风“鸣”“放”的机会企图打开缺口，由于他是用的蜜汁砒霜，加上他又是我们工商界的领导，民建中央和工商联的负责人之一，又是粮食部长，过去还是“七君子”之一，名望大，地位高，更何况我们每个人本身还存在不同程度的消极性的一面会作祟，怎么会不模糊是非，迷失方向呢？而且他还给消极、落后分子撑腰。我们上海工商界政治学校中有人对党有不满情绪，做了打油诗写信给章乃器，他回信不好好帮助分析，而是鼓励他尽量把党说成是一团漆黑。现在还有些人把所有一切理论都看成是“教条”，把一切正义的反批评都看成是“扣帽子”，这种对抗的情绪还不是他挑拨起来的吗？
    三、他说：不承认是两条道路的斗争问题，他说今天在革命已经胜利，宪法已经颁布的情况下，领导权路线问题都已不会发生任何问题。我说，宪法明明规定是工人阶级为领导，你是否定阶级关系存在，也就是否定了工人阶级的领导，这还不是想修改宪法吗？
      四、他说：发牢骚是一回事，要不要领导是另一回事。要把理论问题和政治问题区别开来。我说：理论不能脱离政治，理论是为政治服务的，理论应有立场。而且他又把农民发牢骚，与宗教界、少数民族等的唯心主义思想都拉出来，进行更广泛恶毒的挑拨，他的意思就是说如果把他的言论看作是反动的，那么以上说的这些人也都是两条道路的问题了。我说：有些农民发些牢骚，以及宗教界是唯心论者，等等，可是他们与我们的愿望是一致的，是接受共产党和工人阶级的领导，道路也是一条的——社会主义道路，与你的反党反社会主义的本质不同。
    五、他说：没有讲资产阶级没有两面性，他认为两面性主要是思想作风上的而不是本质的。我说：明明在二中全会说没有两面性了，现在虽承认有两面性，但又断章取义，歪曲毛主席的话，说任何阶级都有两面性，任何阶级都有改造，因此他说这不是本质的是与工人一样的是思想作风上的两面性而不是本质的，这不是明明模糊阶级意识，否定阶级关系吗？
    六、他一再强调领导与被领导的关系只能是先进和落后的关系。我说：根据你的论点是资产阶级分子和工人阶级一样，已经没有本质的区别，而且工人里有先进和落后，资产阶级分子里也有先进和落后，那就是说先进的资产阶级分子也可以领导工人阶级，这还不是明明否定工人阶级的领导吗？
    七、他说：阶级和阶级分子的关系，应当有所不同，这就是集体和个人的不同，又说什么是量变到质变的不同，又说人是可以改造的，阶级是要消灭的，这些似是而非的话，真是容易使我们模糊。那天我的说法：阶级分子在分散时的活动是“剥削”，在成为具体组织的团体也是“剥削”根本没有剥削的区别，而他偏说阶级的剥削本质是先天的，分子的剥削是非本质的，而是后天的，把阶级和分子孤立割裂开来，那么阶级是空洞的吗？阶级的内容是什么呢？阶级肯定是由阶级分子组成的，如果阶级分子没有剥削的本质，那么阶级的本质基础是从什么地方来的呢？他要强调阶级分子与阶级有区别的动机，除了要说资产阶级分子与工人已是一模一样了，可以不要工人阶级领导了，还有什么别的呢？至于是阶级是要消灭的，人是可以改造的，我说这正是说明我们党和国家贯彻和平改造政策的正确和伟大，这是另外一件事。资产阶级消灭后，资产阶级分子的名称当然也完全消灭了，现在生产关系已经起了根本变化，阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是资本家所有制还没有完全改变，剥削还存在，阶级还存在，当然分子还存在。
    八、他说：“墙”和“沟”是过去斗争遗留下来的副作用所造成的。我说不要“三反”难道任干部贪污腐化，没有“五反”难道任资本家“五毒”泛滥，没有“肃反”难道任反革命复辟？没有这些斗争，就不可能建设社会主义，当然不能否认有偏差，有副作用，这是主要的吗？我在“五反”时是被斗得很凶的，当时也有不满，但斗的是“五毒”，洗清了更得到人民的信任，更靠拢了党，工商界很多朋友都和我一样说：没有“五反”教育，我们进不了社会主义社会。
    九、他说：现在工商界的主要缺点是消极自卑，要给工商界平等的人格，不是压服而是要说服。我说：工商界现在的缺点是消极自卑，这是对的，有客观原因，但也有主观原因，主观上主要是消极性的一面在作祟，而章乃器口口声声为了要调动工商界一切积极因素，但是要问是资本主义的积极？还是社会主义的积极？因为他是赞扬资本主义的优越性，说官僚主义比资本主义还危险，好像官僚主义是社会主义制度的产物，我们现在为什么要整风，我们只有在工人阶级的领导下才能反对官僚主义，你也不知道吗？至于平等的人格，工商界从中央到地方都有一定的比例，各级政府都有工商人士担任重要职务，还不平等吗？你难道忘记你自己在国民党反动统治时代只能坐牢，今天给你做上部长还不平等吗？要毛主席让给你才平等吗？归根结蒂还是工人阶级领导就认为不平等对吗？至于说压服：我们敲锣打鼓，要求公私合营，要求学习，要求放弃定息是说服？还是压服？
    十、全国的工人、农民、知识分子、工商界都纷纷表示愤慨，一致严厉地驳斥储安平章伯钧等右派的反动言论，你却无微不至的关怀、同情，并且还讽刺章伯钧的祖先是投降将军（你要他不向共产党投降，反动到底吗？）说他们检讨过早，为他们的反动言论辩护。全国人民要与他们划清界限你却给他们撑腰打气，这还不是两条道路的斗争是什么呢？
    因此我说，工商界的朋友们！我们的头脑要清醒了，眼睛要擦亮了，再不要受蒙蔽，被麻醉了，我们是坚决要走社会主义道路的，而且是希望平平稳稳的走过过渡时期变成社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者的。
