　　Hanoi's Voluntary Laborers
　　By our correspondent Zhan Chao
　　Nguyen Luong Bang appeared today on the dike of the Red River in Hanoi. This 54-year-old Prosecutor General of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Director of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, dressed in a brown casual suit, wearing a headscarf, and holding a hoe, arrived at 6:00 a.m. He went to the small mound in the low-lying area in front of the dike and vigorously dug into the soil. At this moment, illuminated by the dawn, countless hoes could be seen waving together in the distance.
　　Not far from Nguyen Luong Bang, Tran Dang Khoa, Minister of Water Conservancy and Construction of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Le Van Hien, Minister of Finance, Ung Van Khiem, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and heads of many units were energetically attacking the small mound from all directions. Large amounts of sand flowed from under their feet, and others immediately shoveled it into baskets. At the same time, several human conveyor belts transported it to the back of the dike, preparing for future heightening and reinforcement of the dam. In the bustling human conveyor belt, there were Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the Vietnam State Planning Committee, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Federation of Trade Unions, Deputy Minister of Transportation and Post, Deputy Minister of Rural Affairs, and many other responsible cadres.
　　After a while, a group of people carrying hoes, shovels, and baskets came from the north. They had completed the work of repairing the dike over there and came to support the main construction site. In this team were representatives of the National Assembly, members of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, To Huu, Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda Department of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Nguyen Van Huyen, Minister of Education, Deputy Minister of Culture, Deputy Minister of Commerce, and many well-known figures in cultural and educational circles. Dr. Tran Duy Hung, the mayor of Hanoi, also arrived with a hoe. He had been doing a general cleaning around Hoan Kiem Lake with more than 1,500 young people since 5:30 in the morning, and now that the work was coming to an end, he had moved over here.
　　Just as everyone was working hard, a small jeep equipped with a loudspeaker drove to the front of the dike. This was the command vehicle and propaganda vehicle of the Central Organ Trade Union. Several female students on the car were singing songs like "Cuckoo," which caused laughter and cheers up and down the dike. Afterwards, the car broadcast a message saying that the Ministry of Health and Medical Assistance, the Bureau of Experts, and other units responsible for the southern section of the dike repair project had completed their tasks a week ago and were now expanding further south. This caused another burst of even more enthusiastic laughter and cheers.
　　An hour and a half later, people rested according to the command of the headquarters. Nguyen Van Tran, Hoang Quoc Viet, and Ung Van Khiem all said that today was the first day of labor after peace, which was very meaningful and reminded them of the unforgettable days of fighting the enemy and producing in the mountains and forests of North Vietnam and in the Dong Thap Muoi waterlogged plains of South Vietnam during the Anti-Japanese War. Under the guidance of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the cadres of Vietnam have consistently maintained a hard-working and simple style and a habit of loving labor. Although Nguyen Luong Bang had been abroad for many years, he was still very skilled at wielding a hoe, saying that labor was his duty. When he was young, he farmed at home, and later, when he made revolution, he also worked as a coolie on a plantation. Tran Dang Khoa had a blister on his hand, saying that he hadn't used a hoe for three years, but he would get used to it quickly once he picked it up. He pointed to the small mound that was about to be flattened and the increasingly high new pile of soil behind the dike, and said humorously, "This is consistent with the task of our Ministry of Water Conservancy." Someone added, "Especially consistent with the wishes of the people." Everyone agreed with this statement. Ton Hoang Song, Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Assistance, who was working with gloves, said that doing these things now had two benefits: one was that removing the garbage in front of the dike was beneficial to hygiene, and the other was that removing dirt and reinforcing the dike was beneficial to flood prevention. At this time, Hoang Tich Tri, Minister of Health and Medical Assistance, bare-backed and holding a shovel, started working again, and a dozen doctors next to him also joined the battle, and a new labor began.
　　At exactly 9:00 a.m., more than 3,000 laborers on the two-kilometer-long dike of the Red River in Hanoi, southeast of the Red Cross Hospital in the Soviet Union, stopped work according to the order of the headquarters and walked or biked home separately. When the huge bicycle team carrying, holding, or tying hoes, plows, and shovels passed through the streets, it was warmly welcomed by the people of Hanoi.
　　Hoang Tung, editor-in-chief of the "People's Daily," the central organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, was also a member of this special bicycle team. He said: Physical labor can make our leading organs and cadres more connected with reality and the masses. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party decided at its recent meeting to turn it into a system, and detailed methods are still being studied; this decision has been sincerely supported by all leading organs and cadres and enthusiastically supported by the people. Today is a good start.
　　Today, almost all of the central leading cadres of Vietnam came, except for those who were in meetings, going to the countryside and factories, and those who were sick. In their three hours of labor on the Red River dike, they repaired a total of 8,450 square meters of dike edges, removed 233 cubic meters of garbage, and excavated 280 cubic meters of sand and soil, which can be used for seven sections of the Red River dike project.

　　河内的义务劳动者
　　本报记者　展潮
    阮良朋今天出现在河内红河的大堤上，这位五十四岁的越南民主共和国政府总检察长、越南劳动党中央检察委员会主任，穿着一身棕色便服，打着一条头巾，拿着一把镢头，早晨六点钟正，他走到大堤前的洼地里那个小土坡前，用力地掘开一把土。这时候，在曙光的照耀下，可以看到远远近近无数把的镢头一起挥动起来了。
    离开阮良朋不远，越南民主共和国政府水利工程部长陈登科、财政部长黎文献、外交部副部长雍文谦和许多单位的负责人，都在起劲的从四面向小土坡进攻，大量的沙土从他们脚下流下来，另外一些人立刻把它铲到筐子里，同时由几条用人组成的活轮带转到大堤后面去，准备将来增高和加固堤坝用的。在那边川流不息的活的轮带里面，有越南国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍、越南总工会主席黄国越、交通邮电部副部长、农村部副部长等许多负责干部。
    过了一阵，有一批队伍扛着镢头、铁铲、箩筐从北面过来，他们已经完成了那边修整堤坝的工作，跑到主要的工地上来支援的。在这支队伍里面，有国会的代表、祖国战线的中央委员、各民主党派和人民团体的负责人、越南劳动党中央宣传部副部长素友、政府教育部部长阮文煊、文化部副部长、商业部副部长和文化教育界许多知名人士。河内市长陈维兴博士这时候也带着镢头赶来了，他是早上五点半钟就和一千五百多名青年一起在还剑湖边进行大扫除，现在工作告一段落又转到这边来了。
    当大家干得正起劲，一辆装着扩音器的小吉普车开到大堤前面，这是中央机关工会的指挥车兼宣传车，车上几位女学生正歌唱着“布谷鸟”等歌曲，引起了大堤上下一片笑声和欢呼声。过后，车上又广播了一条消息说，负责南段修整堤坝工程的医济部、专家局等单位，一星期前完成了任务，现在正向南再扩展。又引起了一阵更加热烈的笑声和欢呼声。
    一个半小时以后，人们按照指挥部的号令休息下来。阮文珍、黄国越、雍文谦都说今天是和平后的第一个劳动日，很有意义，使人怀念起抗战时期在北越山林里和在南越同塔梅水草平原上边打敌人、边生产那些难忘日子，越南的干部们在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的教导下，一贯保持着艰苦朴素的作风和爱好劳动的习惯。阮良朋虽然出使国外多年，但是挥起镢头来还是十分熟练的，他说劳动是自己的本份。他小的时候就在家里种田，后来闹革命还在田庄里当过苦工。陈登科手上打了一个泡，他说三年没有动镢头了，一拿起来很快就会习惯的，他指着将要削平的小土坡和在大堤后面越来越高的新土堆，幽默地说：“这和我们水利工程部的任务是一致的。”有人补充说：“特别是和人民的愿望是一致的。”大家都很同意这种说法。戴着手套干活的医济部副部长孙皇松说现在作这些工作有两利，一是把堤坝前的垃圾铲除掉有利于卫生，一是除垢加固堤坝有利于防汛。这时候医济部长黄积智光着脊背、拿着铁铲又干起来了，他旁边十几位医生也都投入了战斗，一场新的劳动又开始了。
    九点钟正，以苏联红十字医院后门为中心的、河内红河东南段两公里长的河堤上，三千多位劳动者听从指挥部的号令停止工作，分头步行或者骑自行车回家去。当扛着、拿着或者绑着镢头、锄头、铁铲的庞大的自行车的队伍从市街上穿过的时候，受到河内市民热烈的欢迎。
    越南劳动党中央机关报“人民报”总编辑黄松，也是这个特别的自行车队伍里的一员。他说：体力劳动可以使我们领导机关和干部们更加联系实际联系群众，越南劳动党中央政治局在最近一次会议上已决定把它变成一种制度，详细的办法还在研究中；这种决定受到所有的领导机关、干部们的衷心支持和人民群众的热烈拥护，今天是一个良好的开始。
    今天，越南中央的领导干部们，除了开会的、下乡下厂的和有病的以外，差不多全都来了。他们在红河大堤上三个小时的劳动，一共修整了八千四百五十平方公尺的堤沿，清除了二百三十三立方公尺垃圾，挖掘了二百八十立方公尺沙土，可供红河大堤七段工程用。
                      23日发于河内
