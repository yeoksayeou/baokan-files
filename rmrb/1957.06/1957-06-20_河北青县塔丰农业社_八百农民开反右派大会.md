Qingxian Taifeng Agricultural Cooperative, Hebei
Eight Hundred Peasants Hold Anti-Rightist Meeting

　　This newspaper has received a letter from more than eight hundred peasants of the Taifeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingxian County, Hebei Province, stating that on the evening of June 4, the cooperative held a meeting of all members. The accountant read to the members from the May 31st People's Daily the news that "Renmin University of China continues to hold symposiums, and teachers raise questions from different points of view." When the accountant read Ge Peiqi's speech, the members shouted, saying, "This is not helping the Communist Party offer opinions for rectification, this is opposing socialism and opposing the Communist Party."

　　The members all believed that Ge Peiqi's statement that "improved living standards only apply to Party member cadres" was nonsense. Taking our village as an example, before liberation, only seven landlord families lived well, and most of the others were treated as cattle and horses by these seven landlords, without enough to eat or wear. In 1928, twenty-one people starved to death in the village. It was only after the Communist Party came that we were liberated from hell. Especially since collectivization, production has rapidly increased, life is better, we eat cornmeal and white flour, and everyone has one or two new sets of clothes. Can it really be said that the people's living standards have not improved?

　　Ge Peiqi also said that pork is not eaten by ordinary people, but by Party member cadres, which is also inconsistent with reality. Taking our cooperative members' Spring Festival this year as an example, everyone bought three to five catties of pork. On the contrary, the county and district Party member cadres did not get a single catty, why? They let us cooperative members have it. We have to ask Ge Peiqi, do you have any basis for your words? What we say is based on facts, and if you don't believe us, you can come down and visit.

　　Ge Peiqi also said that because the Communist Party does not serve the people, the masses will rise up to kill the Communist Party and overthrow the Communist Party. We know that if there were no Communist Party, we would not be able to stand up, run our own affairs, and be our own masters. If there were no Communist Party, we would not be able to achieve collectivization, nor would we be able to use tractors. If there were no Communist Party, our village's four thousand mu of low-lying land would not yield grain year after year. We know in our hearts that only the Communist Party serves the people. No matter what you say, we don't believe your nonsense. Our relationship with the Communist Party is one of flesh and blood, and no one can do without the other.

### 河北青县塔丰农业社  八百农民开反右派大会

　　河北青县塔丰农业社
　　八百农民开反右派大会
    本报讯　河北省青县塔丰农业生产合作社八百多农民给本报来信说，在6月4日晚上合作社召开全体社员会议，会计拿了5月31日的人民日报给社员念“中国人民大学继续举行座谈会，教师们从不同观点提出问题”的消息。当念到葛佩琦的发言时，社员们大嚷起来，说：“这那里是帮助共产党提意见整风，这是反对社会主义反对共产党。”
    葛佩琦说的“生活提高只是党员干部”，社员们都认为这是胡说。拿我们村来说，解放前只有七户大地主生活好，其他的大都给这七户地主当牛、当马，吃不上，穿不上。在民国十七年，村里就饿死了二十一口人。共产党来了以后，才把我们从地狱解放出来。特别是合作化以来，生产迅速提高，生活更好，吃玉米面、吃白面，每人都有一、二身新衣服。这难道能说人民生活水平没有提高吗？
    葛佩琦还说猪肉不是老百姓吃了，给党员干部吃了，这也不符合实际。就拿我们社员今年过春节来说，每人都买了三、五斤猪肉。相反的是县、区党员干部一斤都没有吃到，为什么呢？他们让给我们社员吃了。我们得问问葛佩琦，你的话有根据吗？我们说的话都有事实根据，你要不信可下来访问访问。
    葛佩琦还说因为共产党不为人民服务，群众起来要杀共产党，要推翻共产党。我们知道，要是没有共产党，我们就翻不了身，当不了家，做不了主人翁，要没有共产党，我们实现不了合作化，也使不上拖拉机。要没有共产党，我们村四千亩洼地常年不收粮食。我们心里明白，只有共产党才是为人民服务的。你无论怎说怎讲，我们不信你的鬼话。我们和共产党的关系是血和肉的关系，谁也离不开谁。
