　　China Zhi Gong Party Central Committee Enlarged Symposium
　　Continues to Refute Anti-Socialist Fallacies
    This newspaper reports that the enlarged symposium of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, held to assist the Chinese Communist Party in its rectification campaign, continued on the afternoon of the 11th. Chairman Chen Qiyou said that our assistance to the Communist Party's rectification can be combined with our own work to offer opinions, and incorrect remarks in society should be calmly analyzed and criticized, thereby improving our ideological level.
    Hu Xinmin believes that helping the Communist Party with rectification is to eliminate the "three evils" and should not be confused by certain fallacies.
    Yan Xichun said in his speech that those incorrect remarks should be analyzed clearly, clarifying right and wrong, and then criticized to convince people. Ideological problems should be solved ideologically. He said: We should believe that the Chinese Communist Party has unlimited prestige throughout the country and is firmly supported by 600 million people. We firmly support the Communist Party, and we firmly believe in the superiority of the socialist system. One-sided arguments, untrue fallacies, and even alarmist words from people with ulterior motives will never shake the confidence of the vast majority of us.
    Lei Peihong said: Currently, in the movement to help the CCP with rectification, some people's criticisms are unfair and absurd, and we should oppose them. Some arguments want to abolish the leadership of the Party, which is unimaginable. As far as rectification is concerned, without the Communist Party, there would be no rectification. No other class-based political party could dare to expose its shortcomings in the vast masses and ask for criticism from the masses. Rectification is also for China's socialist cause. Without the Communist Party, is there any socialist cause? The idea of not having the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is strange. The criticisms of Ge Peiqi by workers and peasants are correct, not because they are biased. The facts show that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is necessary for China to build a socialist cause.
    Lu Xuxi suggested improving the confidentiality system. In particular, publicly available scientific papers from abroad do not need to be kept secret, which would hinder our requirement to catch up with the world's scientific level within twelve years.
    Huang Dingchen believes that the viewpoints and methods of Zhang Naiqi and others are wrong. Bureaucratism is a matter of work style, and just because there are still incorrect work styles—bureaucratism—in the socialist system, it is wrong to compare the socialist system with the capitalist system, as if socialism is worse than capitalism. This is wrong. Chu Anping's saying of "Party's world" is also wrong. According to his logic, it seems that the "three evils" are produced by the "Party's world." This argument obliterates the facts and is a complete lie with open eyes. In recent years, no major national event has not been decided after repeated consultations. Judging from the current situation, there are fifteen non-Party members who are ministers of the State Council, and there are even more at the deputy ministerial level. Therefore, "Party's world" is not a fact at all. The key to their absurd arguments lies in the error of their position and viewpoint. As for the Party groups and Party committees playing a crucial role in guaranteeing the implementation of the Party's policies and tasks in government offices and schools, this is completely correct and necessary. Some deviations that occurred in the past, forming a situation where non-Party members had positions but no power, were not because the Party groups or Party committees themselves were bad, but because of shortcomings in the work. Rectification is to overcome these shortcomings, but not to negate the role of the Party.
    The meeting will continue.

### 中国致公党中央扩大座谈会  继续驳斥反社会主义的谬论

　　中国致公党中央扩大座谈会
　　继续驳斥反社会主义的谬论
    本报讯  中国致公党中央召开的帮助中国共产党整风的扩大座谈会，于11日下午继续举行。陈其尤主席说，我们帮助共产党整风，可以结合我们的业务来提意见，对社会上一些不正确的言论，应予冷静的分析批判，从而提高我们的思想水平。
    胡新民认为帮助共产党整风，是为了清除“三大害”，不要为若干谬论所混淆。
    严希纯在发言中说，对那些不正确的言论应予分析清楚，弄明是非，然后批判，使人心服。思想问题，从思想上解决问题。他说：我们应该相信，中国共产党在全国范围内，是有无限威信的，它为六亿人民所坚决拥护。我们坚决拥护共产党，我们坚信社会主义制度的优越性，片面的论调，不合事实的谬论，甚至别有用心的人的危言，是绝不会动摇我们绝大多数人的这种信心的。
    雷沛鸿说：目前在帮助中共整风运动中，有些人的若干批评是不公正的，是荒谬的，我们应该反对。有些论点是要取消党的领导，这是不可想像的。就整风来说，没有共产党就没有整风，别的阶级政党，也不可能敢于在广大的群众中揭露自己的缺点，要求群众批评。整风也就是为了中国的社会主义事业。没有共产党，难道还有什么社会主义事业吗？不要中国共产党领导的想法是奇怪的。工人农民对葛佩琦的批评是正确的，不是他们有所偏爱，事实说明必须要中国共产党的领导，中国才能建成社会主义事业。
    陆绪熙建议改善保密制度。尤其是国外公开的科学论文，更不需要用秘密的方式保管，这会阻碍我们要在十二年内赶上世界科学水平的要求。
    黄鼎臣认为章乃器等的言论的观点方法是错误的。官僚主义是工作作风的问题，绝不能因为社会主义制度中仍然有错误的工作作风——官僚主义，就将社会主义制度去同资本主义制度相比拟，好像社会主义比资本主义更坏。这是错误的。储安平“党天下”的说法也是错误的。如就他的逻辑来说，好像“三大害”就是由于“党天下”所产生。这一论点抹杀了事实，是完全睁开眼睛说谎话。几年来国家大事，没有不是经过反复协商然后决定的。就以现在的事实而言，国务院的部长就有十五个非党人士，至于副部长级的那就更多了。所以“党天下”根本不是事实。他们的这些荒谬论点，关键在于他们的立场观点的错误。至于党组和党委会在机关学校中保证党的方针任务的贯彻，已起了极重大的作用，这是完全正确的，也是必要的。过去产生的一些偏差，形成非党人士有职无权，不是党组或党委本身不好，而是工作中的缺点。整风就是要克服这些缺点，但不是要否定党的作用。
    会议仍将继续举行。
