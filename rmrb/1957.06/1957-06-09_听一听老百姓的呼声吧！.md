Listen to the Voices of the People!

Comrade Editor:

I am an ordinary staff member of the Lushun-Dalian Transportation Company. On June 1st, I took the No. 8 express train from Hankou to Xingtai City for work. When the train reached Guangshui Station, a female passenger sitting opposite me borrowed my May 31st People's Daily to read. When the train attendant came to collect tea cups, he stood in front of her and asked her three or four times, but she was engrossed in reading the newspaper and didn't respond. What news attracted her so much? Afterward, she pointed to the newspaper and said to me, "Ge Peiqi's speech in the People's Daily is infuriating." "I've read it," I replied, "Ge Peiqi said that the people would kill the Communist Party and overthrow the Communist Party." Because I spoke these words loudly, it startled the four passengers sitting in the same row. They all looked up, and one of them asked me, "What did you say?" I realized I had made a mistake, and noticed that the four of them were looking at me with suspicion. So I quickly replied, "This is what Ge Peiqi, a lecturer in the Department of Physical Chemistry of the Industrial Economics Department of the Chinese People's University, said. Please read the newspaper." Afraid that he wouldn't believe me, I handed him the newspaper. After the train left Xinyang Station, we all finally knew about Ge Peiqi's speech. Everyone was awake, and we spontaneously started an informal discussion.

The female passenger was the first to speak. She said to us, "I was really angry after reading Ge Peiqi's speech. Who asked him to scold the Communist Party on behalf of us, the people?" An old man dressed in coarse blue cloth interjected, "Ge Peiqi is crazy. In the village, I only hear some commune members complaining about withdrawing from the commune, saying that the commune cadres are bureaucrats, but no one says the Communist Party is bad. I have never heard of the people wanting to kill the Communist Party." "Ge Peiqi said that the people's living standards have not improved, and the people can't afford pork, and it's all because of the poor leadership of the Communist Party," I said, pointing to the newspaper. At this time, a cooperative purchasing agent spoke up: "Not to mention that our country is so big, even a single family sometimes has difficulties and needs to manage its affairs slowly. How can everything be brand new all at once? Although there are difficulties, the lives of many people have greatly improved compared to before liberation, truly a world of difference. If the country has difficulties, how can the people not overcome them? To be honest, it's not easy to manage a household."

Then the female passenger continued, "Take me, for example. I'm forty-three years old this year, and I live in Huangshi City. One of my two sons works in Shanghai, and the other studies in Beijing. I'm going to Beijing to see my children." I asked, "What does your children's father do?" She replied, "He works as a technician in the Shanghai Steel Factory. Before liberation, my family's life was insecure. We didn't know where the next meal was coming from, and we were bullied by the landlord 'master'. After liberation, my family's life greatly improved, and there's no comparison to before liberation. In the early days of liberation, the government, in order to take care of my family's financial difficulties, introduced my husband to work in a factory. Later, the state trained him to become a technician, earning more than one hundred yuan a month. I joined the production cooperative at home, and my income was more than enough. So, the year before last, my family voluntarily requested to the school where my children attended that we no longer needed the student aid. You see, my family received care from the country when we were in difficulty. Now that life is better, how can we forget our benefactor—the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! I never dreamed that poor people like us would have today." I repeated Mr. Ge's speech: "Who are the people whose living standards have improved? The Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes but now ride in small cars and wear woolen uniforms." She said, "I didn't follow the Communist Party in revolution in the past, I just lived one day at a time. But now my life is no lower than the living standards of the Communist Party members who participated in the revolution and made contributions." The cooperative purchasing agent said, "Don't think Ge Peiqi is an intellectual. Judging from his speech, he doesn't seem like a knowledgeable person, and he's not even as good as those of us who haven't studied."

I listened to them and then introduced myself: "I am a twenty-six-year-old Hui youth. When I was studying before liberation, I had to hide my ethnicity, otherwise I would be wronged under the pressure of Han chauvinism. In the old society, Hui people, besides doing small business, most people didn't have the opportunity to study, had no social status, and lived a life inferior to that of the Han people. In the old society, many people called us poor 'Hui people.' All Hui people who have lived through the old society know this well. Since the day the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led China, they have raised the social status of our ethnic minorities to be the same as that of the Han people. Hui youth have entered government agencies, schools, factories, and enterprises, and Han people treat us like brothers. The Party and the state's meticulous care for us has deeply touched the hearts of our Hui people. Whenever we gather to celebrate our own festivals, the Ahong always represents the Hui people in paying tribute to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Ahong teaches us never to forget the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It's not difficult to see the Hui people's support for the Communist Party and respect for Chairman Mao. Only with the existence of the Communist Party can our ethnic minorities live and work in peace and contentment. We support no political party other than the great Chinese Communist Party.

Unconsciously, Zhumadian Station arrived, and our conversation ended.

### 听一听老百姓的呼声吧！

专栏：

    听一听老百姓的呼声吧！编辑同志：
    我是旅大地区运输公司的一个普通职员，于6月1日从汉口市乘八次特快前往邢台市工作。列车行驶到广水站时，我对面的一位女旅客借我的5月31日人民日报看。当列车服务员收茶杯的时候，站在她面前一连问她三、四句，她仍在聚精会神地看报，始终没作回答。是什么新闻吸引着她呢？过后，她指着报纸对我说：“您看人民大学讲师葛佩琦的发言真气死个人。”“我看过啦”，我接着说：“葛佩琦说老百姓会杀共产党，打倒共产党。”由于我说的这句话的声音较高而惊动了同座位的四位旅客，他们都抬起了头，其中的一位问我：“你讲什么？”我一看不好，发觉了他们四位用怀疑的目光在看着我。于是我赶忙着回答：“这是中国人民大学工业经济系物理化学教研室讲师葛佩琦说的。请您们看报吧。”我怕他不相信，就把报纸交给他。列车离开了信阳站后，总算我们六人都知道了葛佩琦的发言。大家也不困了，自动的你一言我一句的开了无领导的交谈。
    第一位开腔的是那位女旅客。她对我们说：“我看了葛佩琦的发言之后真生气，我们老百姓谁请他去骂共产党啦？”一位身穿粗蓝布衣服的老人插嘴说：“葛佩琦是发疯啦。我在村中只听有的社员闹退社，说社干是什么官僚，可没有人不说共产党好的，我从来没有听说过老百姓要杀共产党。”“葛佩琦说人民生活水平没提高，老百姓吃不着猪肉，都是共产党领导的不好。”我指着报纸道。这时候，旁边一位合作社采购员却开了腔：“先不说我们国家这样的大，就是我们一个家庭有时还要发生困难，都得慢慢的治家，那能一下子就焕然一新。虽然有困难，很多人民的生活已比解放前大大提高，真有十万八千里，国家有困难老百姓怎能不去克服呢。说实在的，当家不易。”
    接着那位女旅客又继续说：“就拿我说吧，今年四十三岁了，家住在黄石市，两个儿子一个在上海工作，一个在北京读书，我是去北京看小孩的。”我问：“小孩父亲干什么？”她回答：“在上海钢厂当技术工人。解放前我家的生活是没有保障的，吃这顿没那顿，还受地主‘老爷’的气。解放了，我家的生活大大改善了，同解放前相差的没法比了。解放初期政府为了照顾我家的生活困难，把我爱人介绍到工厂作工，后来国家又把他培养成一个技术工人，每月拿一百多元，我在家参加了生产合作社，收入有了敷余，所以前年我家主动的向小孩所在学校提出不再要助学金的要求。您想我家在困难的时候得到国家的照应，如今生活好了，怎能忘记恩人——共产党和毛主席呢！过去作梦也没想到像我们这样的穷人会有今天。”我重复着葛先生的发言：“生活水平提高的是哪些人呢？过去穿破鞋、现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部。”她道：“我过去没跟随共产党闹革命，只是活一天算一天。但如今我的生活并不低于闹过革命而有功的共产党员的生活水平。”合作社采购员道：“别看葛佩琦是个知识分子，看他的发言不像个有学问的人，还赶不上咱们没有念过书的人。”
    我听他们不说啦，就对他们介绍：“我是一个二十六岁的回族青年。解放前念书时得隐瞒着族别，否则会在大汉族主义的压力下受到委屈。回族人们在旧社会除了作作小买卖外，大部分人得不到求学的机会，没有社会地位，过着比汉族人低一等的生活。旧社会很多人称我们是穷‘回子’。凡是从旧社会度过来的回族人都深知这一点的。自共产党和毛主席领导着中国那天起，把我们少数民族的社会地位提高到和汉族人们一样。回族青年走进了机关、学校、工厂、企业，汉族人们把我们当成亲兄弟。党和国家对我们无微不至的关怀，深深地打动了我们回族人民的心。每逢在我们集会庆祝自己的节日时，阿訇总是代表着回民向共产党和毛主席致敬。阿訇教导我们千万别忘了共产党和毛主席的恩情。这不难看出回族人们拥护共产党和尊敬毛主席的心情。只有共产党存在，我们少数民族才能安居乐业，我们除了拥护伟大的中国共产党而外，不拥护任何阶级的政党。
    不知不觉地驻马店车站到了，我们的交谈会也就散了。　白俊升
