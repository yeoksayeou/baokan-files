　　The American magazine "Time" said that after Britain relaxed its trade embargo against China, many American capitalists and officials advocated that the United States should follow suit. It is said that this group includes Secretary of State Dulles' brother, Allen Dulles, the head of the U.S. intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency.

　　"Time" magazine said that Allen Dulles' advocacy of trade with China was not for doing business, but for doing his line of "business." One of his reasons is that even a little Sino-American trade can give his agents a great opportunity to conduct espionage work in China. This really fits the Chinese idiom: "The old drunkard's intention is not in the wine."

　　From the perspective of the American ruling group, this plan of Allen Dulles, the old drunkard, is of course not bad. However, even if Sino-American trade resumes, it is a big question whether the CIA's lackeys can get anything. The CIA has sent no small number of agents to China through the Chiang Kai-shek group, but it seems that they have not obtained any intelligence that can satisfy Allen Dulles. The reason is very simple: most of them have gone to jail.

　　However, as the saying goes, "True words are revealed after drinking." Allen Dulles, this old drunkard, also revealed a truth, that is, wherever there is American business, there are American intelligence agents engaged in intelligence gathering. This is something that not only the Chinese people, but also the people of all countries that have economic ties with the United States should be vigilant about.

### 醉翁真言

　　醉翁真言
    美国“时代”周刊说，在英国放宽对中国的贸易禁运以后，美国的资本家和官方人士中间，有不少人主张美国也应当跟上来。据说，在这批人中间，还包括国务卿杜勒斯的兄弟、美国特务机关中央情报局的头子艾伦·杜勒斯。
    “时代”周刊说，艾伦·杜勒斯之所以主张同中国进行贸易，并不是为了做生意，而是为了干他的那一行“买卖”。他的理由之一是，那怕是一点点的中美贸易，也可以使他的特务人员得到在中国进行谍报工作的很大机会。这倒真合了中国的一句成语：“醉翁之意不在酒”。
    艾伦·杜勒斯这位醉翁的打算，从美国统治集团的角度来看，当然是不坏的。不过，就算中美贸易恢复，美国中央情报局的狗腿子们是不是能搞到什么，却是个很大的问题。中央情报局通过蒋介石集团派到中国来的特务不算少了，可是看来他们并没有搞到可以使艾伦·杜勒斯满意的情报。原因很简单，他们之中绝大部分都进了监狱了。
    不过，俗语说得好，“酒后露真言”。艾伦·杜勒斯这位醉翁，倒也透露了一个真相，这就是，凡是有美国的生意经的地方，也就有美国的特务人员在搞情报。这倒是不但中国人民，而且一切同美国有经济瓜葛的国家的人民都值得警惕的地方。
