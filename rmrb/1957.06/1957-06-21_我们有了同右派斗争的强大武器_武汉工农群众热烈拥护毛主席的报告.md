　　We Have a Powerful Weapon to Fight the Rightists
    Wuhan Workers and Peasants Warmly Support Chairman Mao's Report
    (Our newspaper Wuhan, 20th dispatch) The broad masses of workers and peasants here have expressed warm support for Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."
    Li Shulan, a female worker at Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, said excitedly after reading the full text of Chairman Mao's speech: "With Chairman Mao's speech, we have a powerful weapon to fight against the reactionary statements of those rightist elements." Old technician Pan Baoxing said that Chairman Mao's proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people is clearly and obviously for the purpose of better uniting the 600 million people to advance along the road of socialism. However, those rightist elements are trying to use the opportunity of handling contradictions among the people to oppose the leadership of our Party, and we cannot allow such shameful behavior.
    The six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds mentioned in Chairman Mao's speech have aroused great interest among cadres and workers in Wuhan. They believe that we were not clear in our understanding during the great blooming and contending, but with the six criteria, we have a clear direction and a broader vision. Liang Jinshan, an old foreman at the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, said that Chairman Mao's proposition of "we advocate freedom with leadership, and democracy under centralized leadership" is very correct. He said that in our country, there are people's congresses at all levels, and enterprises have workers' representative conferences. Can't we express our opinions freely here? This kind of democracy and freedom is completely in line with the interests of our working people. If those rightist elements talk about bourgeois democracy and engage in "two-chamber system" and "political design institutes," that would be depriving us working people of our democratic freedom!
    After seeing the full text of Chairman Mao's speech, cadres and members of Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Wuhan unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's assessment of the agricultural cooperativization issue was very correct. They pointed out that some people say that cooperativization has been messed up and attempt to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, which is completely wrong. Cooperative member Xie Jiayun refuted the fallacy that cooperativization has been messed up with the bitter life before liberation – being single at the age of forty-two and not getting married and having children until after liberation. He said that our emancipation entirely depends on the Communist Party. Those who say that cooperativization has been messed up are either deliberately sabotaging cooperativization or are ideologically very reactionary.

### 我们有了同右派斗争的强大武器  武汉工农群众热烈拥护毛主席的报告

　　我们有了同右派斗争的强大武器
    武汉工农群众热烈拥护毛主席的报告
    本报武汉20日电　此间广大工农群众对毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，表示热烈拥护。
    武汉国棉一厂女工李淑兰读了毛主席的讲演全文，兴奋地说：“有了毛主席的讲演，我们就有了跟那些右派分子的反动言论作斗争的强大武器。”老技工潘宝兴说，毛主席提出正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，明明显显是为了更好地团结六亿人民朝着社会主义的道路前进。但是，那些右派分子竟想借处理人民内部矛盾的机会反对我们党的领导，我们不能允许这种可耻行为。
    毛主席讲演中提到的辨别香花、毒草的六个标准，引起武汉市干部和工人的极大兴趣。他们认为，在大鸣大放中，我们认识不明确，有了六条标准就明确了方向，眼界宽广了。长江大桥工程管理局老领工员梁金山说，毛主席提的“我们主张有领导的自由，主张集中领导下的民主”，是十分正确的。他说，在我们国家中，有各级人民代表大会，企业里有职工代表大会，我们有什么意见，不是在这里可以畅所欲言吗？这种民主自由，完全符合我们劳动人民的利益。如果让那些右派分子高谈资产阶级民主，搞什么“两院制”和“政治设计院”，那才是剥夺我们劳动人民的民主自由哩！
    武汉市郊区解放乡新桥农业社干部和社员看到毛主席的讲演全文后，一致认为毛主席对农业合作化问题的估计十分正确。他们指出，有些人说合作化搞糟了，企图取消共产党的领导，这是完全错误的。社员谢家运以解放前的辛酸生活——四十二岁还当光棍，直到解放后才结婚生孩子的事实，驳斥说合作化搞糟了的谬论。他说，我们翻身全靠共产党得来的，说合作化搞糟了的人，不是有意破坏合作化，就是思想上十分反动。
