　　Cuckoo Sings on Cuckoo Branch
　　Zhou Shoujuan
　　Among birds, the one I feel most connected to is the cuckoo. I remember forty-five years ago, when I started writing sentimental novels, I happened to see a "Legend of Princess Changping" by Huang Yunshan, a lyricist of the Qing Dynasty. The last sentence of the Manjianghong poem in the first act was "The cuckoo cries, making one thin." So I gave myself the pen name "Shoujuan" (Thin Cuckoo). Since then, I have been writing and using it until now, and it has become my official name. Cuckoos often cry sadly, even crying blood. In the past, poets and lyricists called it "a seed of sorrow between heaven and earth." A cuckoo crying making one thin, its sadness can be imagined. However, there is a famous Polish folk song called "Little Cuckoo." Although I don't know the lyrics, I imagine it must be a joyful sound, pleasant and lovely.
　　Although birds and flowers are related, birds have bird names and flowers have flower names, and almost none are the same. Only the cuckoo is both a flower and a bird, which is very rare. The great Tang Dynasty poet Bai Letian wrote a poem with the line "Cuckoo flowers fall, the cuckoo cries." Years ago, my deceased friend Ma Mengrong painted cuckoos and cuckoo flowers for me, and his poem also had the line "After telling all the spring sorrows, spring does not care, the cuckoo sings on the cuckoo branch." Although the sentence is ordinary, I find it has a special flavor.
　　The cuckoo has several other names, of which Du Yu, Zigui, and Xie Bao are more commonly seen. According to Li Shizhen: "The cuckoo comes from Sichuan, and now it is also found in the south. It looks like a sparrowhawk, but its color is dark black, with a red mouth and a small crest. It crows in late spring, crying all night until dawn, always facing north when it cries, and it is especially loud in summer, day and night. Farmers wait for it to start their agricultural work. It only eats worms and does not build nests, living in other nests to raise its young, and hibernates in winter." Everything about the cuckoo is clearly stated here. Seeing that it can help farmers with their agricultural work and eat worms, it is clearly a beneficial bird. Its crying is perhaps out of sincerity, containing the meaning of "weeping and saying," so that farmers can increase their enthusiasm and not delay their agricultural work.
　　The cuckoo has a myth. It is said that the King of Shu, Du Yu, became emperor, calling himself Emperor Wang. At that time, there was a man from Jingzhou who died and came back to life, named Biling. Emperor Wang appointed him as his prime minister. It happened that there was a flood, and the people were destitute. Biling carved Mount Wu and opened the Three Gorges to eliminate the flood. After a few years, Emperor Wang ceded the throne to him because of his great achievements, calling him Kai Ming Shi. He himself entered the Western Mountains, lived in seclusion to cultivate Taoism, and after his death, he suddenly transformed into a cuckoo. When spring came, he would always cry sadly, making people feel sad when they heard it. It is said that the cuckoo's cry is saying "It's better to return home," so there are many poems and lyrics on this theme, such as the Song Dynasty poet Fan Zhongyan's poem: "Entering the green smoke at night, it cries; searching for fragrant trees during the day, it flies; the spring mountains are infinitely beautiful, yet it says it is better to return home." Kang Boke's Manjianghong lyrics say: "...Diligently telling it a thousand times a hundred times, only saying one sentence repeatedly; saying it's better to return, it's better to return, the sorrow is keen." Every late spring, when the cuckoo flowers bloom in my garden, I can often hear birds calling "Ju qi, ju qi," which is said to be the cuckoo. "Ju qi" is the Suzhou-Shanghai dialect for "return home." Perhaps the cuckoos of Sichuan have also changed their accent when they arrived in Suzhou, and are too lazy to speak Mandarin.
　　Westerners seem to like listening to the sound of cuckoos, so Poland has the "Little Cuckoo" song. There is also a type of cuckoo clock in various Western European countries. Every hour, a cuckoo jumps out to tell the time, making a "Kegu" sound, which is the same as the English name for the cuckoo, "Cuckoo," which is very interesting. I don't think the sound of the cuckoo is sad. Why did the ancients feel sad and heartbroken when they heard it? It was mostly a psychological effect, right?

### 杜鹃枝上杜鹃啼

　　杜鹃枝上杜鹃啼
　　周瘦鹃
    鸟类中和我最有缘的，要算是杜鹃了。记得四十五年前，我开始写作哀情小说；有一天偶然看到一部清代词人黄韵珊的“帝女花传奇”，那第一折楔子的满江红词末一句是“鹃啼瘦”三字，于是给自己取了个笔名“瘦鹃”，从此东涂西抹，沿用至今，倒变成了正式的名号。杜鹃惯作悲啼，甚至啼出血来，从前诗人词客，称之为“天地间愁种子”，鹃而啼瘦，其悲哀可知。可是波兰有支名民歌“小杜鹃”，我虽不知道它的词儿，料想它定然是一片欢愉之声，悦耳动听。
    鸟和花虽有连带关系，然而鸟有鸟名，花有花名，几乎没一个是雷同的，惟有杜鹃却是花鸟同名，最为难得。唐代大诗人白乐天诗，曾有“杜鹃花落杜鹃啼”之句；往年亡友马孟容兄给我画杜鹃和杜鹃花，题诗也有“诉尽春愁春不管，杜鹃枝上杜鹃啼”之句，句虽平凡，我却觉得别有情味。
    杜鹃有好几个别名，以杜宇、子规、谢豹三个较为习见。据李时珍说：“杜鹃出蜀中，今南方亦有之，状如雀鹞，而色惨黑，赤口有小冠。春暮即鸣，夜啼达旦，鸣必向北，至夏尤甚，昼夜不止，其声哀切。田家候之，以兴农事。惟食虫蠹，不能为巢，居他巢生子，冬月则藏蛰”。关于杜鹃的一切，这里说的很明白，看它能帮助田家兴农事，食虫蠹，分明是一头益鸟。它的啼声哀切，也许是出于至诚，含有“垂涕而道”的意思，好使田家提高积极性，不要耽误了农事。
    杜鹃有一个神话，据说是蜀王杜宇称帝，号望帝，那时荆州有一个死而复生的人，名鳖灵，望帝立以为相。恰逢洪水为灾，民不聊生，鳖灵凿巫山，开三峡，给除了水患。隔了几年，望帝因他功高，就让位于他，号开明氏，自己入西山，隐居修道，死了之后，忽然化为杜鹃，到了春天，总要悲啼起来，使人听了心酸。据说，杜鹃的啼声，是在说“不如归去”，因此诗词中就有不少以此为题材的，如宋代范仲淹诗云：“夜入翠烟啼，昼寻芳树飞；春山无限好，犹道不如归。”康伯可满江红词有云：“……镇日叮咛千百遍，只将一句频频说；道不如归去不如归，伤情切。”每逢暮春时节，我的园子里杜鹃花开，常可听得有鸟在叫着“居起，居起”，据说就是杜鹃，“居起”是苏沪人“归去”的方言，大概四川的杜鹃到了苏州，也变此腔，懒得说普通话了。
    西方人似乎爱听杜鹃声，所以波兰有“小杜鹃”歌。西欧各国还有一种杜鹃钟，每到一点钟有一头杜鹃跳出来报时，作“克谷”之声，正与杜鹃的英国名称“Cuckoo”相同，十分有趣。我以为杜鹃声并不悲哀，为什么古人听了要心酸，要肠断，多半是一种心理作用吧？
