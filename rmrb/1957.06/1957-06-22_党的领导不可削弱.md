　　Party Leadership Must Not Be Weakened
　　Zhang Shiying, Lecturer, Department of Philosophy, Peking University

　　The purpose of the rectification movement is to eliminate the three major isms, strengthen Party leadership, and better accomplish the task of building socialism. However, unfortunately, in the process of non-Party members helping the Party in the rectification, some anti-socialist remarks that weakened Party leadership and opposed Party leadership emerged. This article will only discuss my opinions on the following views.

　　If the Party leads the country, should Party members not hold leadership positions?

　　(1) There is an opinion that the Party should lead the country only through its policies, and should not simply put Party members in leadership positions.

　　Indeed, the Party is to lead the country through the policies it puts forward, and the Party's leadership of the country does not mean that every work unit, large or small, must be led by a Party member. However, first of all, if Party members do not hold the most important leadership positions in the country, then how can the Party lead the decision-making and implementation of policies? How can it still be called a ruling party? Some may admit that Party members should hold the most important leadership positions in the country, but should not "arrange for a Party member to be the head" in work positions of all sizes across the country. Regarding this point, I think that if the Party insists on arranging a Party member to be the leader in every work unit, regardless of whether its members are qualified, it would certainly be wrong. However, this is not the case now. The fact is that leadership positions in many places are held by non-Party members. However, if we consider how the Party can better implement its leadership role throughout the country, then it is perfectly reasonable in a Communist Party-led country to allow qualified Party members to be the leaders of their work units wherever conditions permit. We cannot imagine that the Party can lead the country while Party members withdraw from leadership positions. It is true that some unqualified Party members have become leaders, but this is only a matter of improper personnel arrangements, which is precisely the shortcoming that should be overcome in the rectification. If it is believed that having unqualified Party members as leaders is "Party's world," then aren't there also many non-Party members who hold high positions but are not qualified? How should this be explained?

　　If the Party needs to maintain confidentiality, can the masses not exercise supervision?

　　(2) There is also an opinion that the Party keeps everything secret, and the masses cannot supervise the Party. Some even advocate that the Party should abolish reporting altogether.

　　I think that if it is believed that the Party should not have any secrets to keep at all, and that the Party itself should not have any reporting at all, then in reality, it not only denies the Party's leadership but also fundamentally eliminates the Party's independent existence. Any independent political party has its own internal affairs; any independent political party also has its own ways of understanding the situation. Moreover, if a Communist Party, as the vanguard of the proletariat and leading the people of the whole country to build socialism, does not understand the basic situation of the people, how can it be the vanguard of the proletariat? How can it lead the people of the whole country to build socialism?

　　If the Party needs to maintain confidentiality, can the masses not exercise supervision? I think that since the Party has its own independence, it will have its own internal affairs that the masses cannot interfere with, nor do they need to interfere with. For these affairs, there is no question of mass supervision at all. On the other hand, the Party is the leading party of the people of the whole country. The policies and plans put forward by the Party are always discussed and debated with the people before they are implemented. However, when discussing and implementing these decisions together, do the people not have the right to criticize the errors and shortcomings of the Party and Party members? Isn't this the people's supervision of the Party? Of course, a few Party members cannot stand even relatively sharp criticism. These Party members have created a misconception in the minds of some people, as if the masses cannot supervise the Party and Party members. Regarding this point, I think that Party members with this style should deeply examine and criticize their own thoughts, correct their shortcomings, and not allow their personal thoughts and styles to damage the Party's prestige. However, non-Party members who have this misconception should also learn to distinguish between individual Party members and the entire Party, and should not think that the entire Party is unwilling to accept mass supervision simply because some Party members are not willing to humbly accept the criticism of the masses. Of course, this is also a process of raising ideological understanding for non-Party members: only when we have a deeper understanding of the nature of the Party and a stronger determination to serve the cause of socialist construction, will we dare to criticize the errors and shortcomings of the Party and Party members in their work, and dare to supervise the Party. We believe that Party members must sincerely accept criticism and supervision, but at the same time, non-Party members must also improve their understanding and dare to criticize and supervise. We cannot always give up supervision ourselves and then say that the Party does not accept supervision at all.

　　Will dividing the masses into progressive and backward hinder the enthusiasm of work?

　　(3) Some people think that as long as the masses are seen as having progressive and backward distinctions, that is to divide people into grades; it will hinder work enthusiasm; some even slander that "the so-called activists are all people who boast, flatter, shamelessly seek personal gain, and act submissively." We know that the Party is the vanguard of the most progressive and revolutionary class—the working class. Under its leadership, the Chinese people have achieved the complete victory of the New Democratic Revolution, and now our great motherland is building socialism at an accelerated pace. The broadest masses of the people in the country have realized in the face of countless ironclad facts that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are their beacons and stars, and they are all wholeheartedly listening to Chairman Mao and following the Communist Party. Does anyone who truly loves socialism have the right to call these active masses who are close to the Party people who are "submissive" and "flattering"? Why were many activists not active before liberation and unwilling to flatter the Kuomintang, but only willing to become active after liberation and "flatter the Communist Party"? This fact alone is worth considering carefully when judging the enthusiasm of the masses. As for the fact that the degree of enthusiasm and the speed of progress are inconsistent among the vast active masses in the country, this is entirely a matter of fact, which cannot be denied by any individual subjectively, and is not at all the so-called "artificial grading" as said by some who maliciously attack the Party. Who does not know that in our society, activists are "people who sincerely follow the Communist Party and actively serve the people"? Which of the Party's various calls and movements is not relying on the vast number of active masses to achieve and promote it? In today's society, the broad masses are willing to be close to the Party, and are willing to actively serve the cause of socialist construction. This is the conscious demand of the masses, and it is also a right that everyone enjoys. However, due to the different environments in which people were born, the different educations they received, and the different experiences they had in their lives, some people progress slower, and some people progress faster; some people have taken detours on the road of progress, and some people have gone more smoothly. What is incomprehensible about this? This is the difference in order shown by the broad masses themselves on the road of progress, and what does it have to do with "artificial grading"? I think that the speed of progress has a fast and slow pace, this objective fact cannot be eliminated at any time, and it itself cannot be the reason for hindering work enthusiasm. What is the reason for hindering work enthusiasm? It is the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism of the leadership, which make the leadership's thinking rigid, and therefore unable to see the transformation between progress and backwardness at any time. Some of the backward have already progressed, but the leadership does not see their progress, thus hindering their enthusiasm for progress; some of the progressive have already become backward, but the leadership does not see their backwardness, which will also hinder the enthusiasm of another part of the people. I think that in this rectification movement, we should thoroughly correct this metaphysical attitude of the Party members, especially the leading comrades, towards the masses. However, if someone denies that progress has a sequence altogether because the leadership has had this metaphysical attitude in the past, and even slanders the progressive people who are close to the Party as "flattering," that is to obliterate the facts, blur right and wrong, and the result will inevitably hinder everyone from actively being close to the Party, thereby isolating the Party. I believe that most activists have played a positive role. As for a few so-called activists who have done some active things on the surface, but have not actually played the role of a bridge between the masses and the Party, these so-called activists are the ones we should criticize.

### 党的领导不可削弱

　　党的领导不可削弱
　　北京大学哲学系讲师　张世英
    整风运动的目的就是要整掉三大主义，以加强党的领导，更好地完成建设社会主义的任务。但是，不幸在党外人士帮助党整风过程中却出现了一些削弱党的领导、反对党的领导的反社会主义言论。本文仅就以下几种言论谈谈自己的意见。
    党领导国家，难道党员反而不应担任领导工作吗？
    （一）有这样一种意见，认为党领导国家，只应当通过党的政策来领导，而不应该尽把些党员放在领导岗位上。
    诚然，党是要通过它所提出的政策来领导国家的，党领导国家也并不等于每一个大小工作单位一定都要由党员做领导人；但是，首先，如果党员不担任全国最重要的领导工作，那么，党又如何能领导政策的决定和执行呢？那它又怎么还能叫做一个执政党呢？有人也许可以承认党员应该担任全国最重要的领导工作，但不应该在全国范围内的大小工作岗位上都“安排一个党员做头儿”；关于这一点，我想，如果党不管它的党员能否称职，硬要在每一个工作单位安排一个党员做领导，那诚然是错误的；然而现在并没有这样的事实，现在的事实正是许多地方的领导工作是由非党人士来担任的。不过，如果我们考虑到党如何能更好地把它的领导作用贯彻到全国的话，那么，凡是有条件的地方，尽量让称职的党员作他那个工作单位的领导人，这在一个共产党领导的国家里又为甚么不是完全合理的呢？我们不能设想党员都退出领导岗位而还谈得上甚么党可以领导国家。诚然有些不称职的党员做了领导；然而这只是人事安排不当的问题，也正是整风中所应该克服的缺点。如果认为有不称职的党员当领导，就算是“党天下”，那么非党人士不是也有不少身居高位而并不称职的吗？对此，又该如何解释呢？
    党需要保密，是不是群众就无法实行监督？
    （二）还有一种意见，认为党是什么都保守秘密的，群众对党无法实行监督，有人甚至主张党应该根本废除汇报。
    我想，如果认为党根本不应该有密可保，认为党自己根本不应该有汇报，那在实际上就不单是否认了党的领导，而且是根本取消了党的独立存在。任何一个独立的政党都有它自己内部的事务；任何一个独立的政党也都有它自己了解情况的途径；何况一个作为无产阶级的先锋队、领导全国人民建设社会主义的共产党，如果根本不了解人民群众的基本情况，那它还如何能做无产阶级的先锋队？还如何能领导全国人民建设社会主义呢？
    党需要保密，是否群众就无法实行监督呢？我想，党既然有它自己的独立性，它就会有它自己内部的事务为群众所不能干涉，也不需要干涉，对于这些事务，就根本谈不上群众监督的问题。另一方面，党是全国人民的领导党，党所提出的政策、方案总是要和人民群众商量讨论，然后才付诸实施；但是，在共同讨论和实行这些决策时，人民群众不是完全有权利批评党和党员的错误与缺点吗？这不就是人民群众对党实行监督吗？当然，有少数党员是一点也受不得比较尖锐的批评的；这些党员曾经在某些人的心目中造成了一种错觉，好像群众是无法对党和党员实行监督似的。对于这一点，我觉得凡是有这种作风的党员应该深深检查、批判自己的思想，改正缺点，不要让自己个人的思想作风，损害了党的威信。不过，有这种错觉的非党人士，也应该学会区别党员个人和整个的党，不要因为某些党员不虚心接受群众的批评，就认为整个党也是不肯接受群众监督的。当然，这对于非党人士说，也是一个提高思想认识的过程：我们只有对党的性质认识愈深刻，为社会主义建设事业服务的决心愈坚强，我们才愈敢于批评党和党员工作中的错误与缺点，愈敢于对党实行监督。我们觉得党员一定要诚心接受批评、监督，但同时非党员也要提高认识，敢于批评和监督；我们不能老是自己放弃监督，而又说党根本不接受监督。
    把群众分成进步和落后，会不会阻碍工作的积极性？
    （三）有人认为只要把群众看成有进步与落后之分，那就是把人划了等级；就会阻碍工作积极性；有人甚至诬蔑“所谓积极分子都是吹牛拍马、无耻钻营、唯唯诺诺的人”。我们知道党是最进步、最革命的阶级——工人阶级的先锋队，在它的领导下，中国人民已经取得了新民主主义革命的完全胜利，现在我们伟大的祖国又正以加速的步伐建设着社会主义。全国最广大的人民群众在无数铁的事实面前认识到了共产党和毛主席是自己的灯塔和明星，他们都心心愿愿地听毛主席的话，跟共产党走。难道任何一个真正热爱社会主义的人有权利称这些靠拢党的积极群众是“唯唯诺诺”和“拍马屁”的人吗？为什么有许多积极分子在解放前不积极，不肯拍国民党的马屁，而只是到解放后才愿意积极起来，“拍共产党的马屁”呢？仅仅这件事实就很值得我们在判断群众的积极性时好好地加以考虑。至于全国广大积极的群众中，其积极的程度和进步的速度不一致，这完全是一种事实的存在，不是那个个人主观上所可以否认的，更不是像某些恶意攻击党的人们所说的甚么“人为的等级划分”。谁不知道，在我们社会里，积极分子就是“真心跟着共产党走、积极为人民服务的人”呢？党所提出的各项号召和运动，那一样不是依靠广大的积极群众来实现和推动的呢？在今天的社会里，广大的群众都愿意靠拢党，都愿意积极为社会主义建设事业服务，这是群众自觉的要求，也是人人都享有的权利。不过，由于各人出身的环境不同，所受的教育不同，一生所受的遭遇不同，因此，有人进步慢一些，有人进步快一些；有人在进步的路上走了弯路，有人走得比较顺利些，这又有什么不可以理解的呢？这是广大群众在进步道路上自己表现出来的先后之分，与“人为的等级划分”有甚么相干呢？我看，进步速度之有快慢，这件客观事实是任何时候也消灭不了的，它本身不能成为阻碍工作积极性的原因。阻碍工作积极性的原因是什么呢？是领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，它们使领导上思想硬化，因而不能随时看到进步与落后之间的转化。有些落后的已经进步了，领导上看不到他们的进步，于是阻碍了他们进步的积极性；有些进步的已经落后了，领导上看不到他们的落后，这也会阻碍另外一部分人的积极性。我想，在这次整风运动中，应该好好纠正党员中间，特别是领导同志们这种对群众采取形而上学看法的思想作风。不过，如果有人因为领导上曾经有过这种形而上学的态度就根本否认进步有先后，甚至诬蔑进步的靠拢党的人是“拍马屁”，那就是抹煞事实、模糊是非，其结果必然阻碍大家积极靠拢党，从而使党孤立。我认为大多数积极分子是起了良好作用的，至于有少数所谓积极分子，表面上做了一些积极的事，实际上并未在群众与党之间起桥梁的作用，这种所谓积极分子是我们应该加以批评的。
