　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: The US military authorities in Japan, in the name of the "United Nations Command," issued a "special memorandum" on June 21st, using fabricated and distorted facts to defend its actions of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement.

　　This "memorandum" clearly exposes the US's consistent perfidious nature. The Korean Armistice Agreement was personally signed by the US representative on July 27, 1953, but the US in the "memorandum" said that "no established or divinely ordained law" obligates the "United Nations Command" to not obtain modern weapons.

　　The fact that the US unilaterally brought reinforcing weapons into South Korea after the armistice has been repeatedly exposed by the Korean and Chinese sides; fearing that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection teams would hinder its smuggling of weapons into South Korea, the US unilaterally prohibited the inspection teams from conducting inspections in South Korea a year ago. However, the US openly lied in the "memorandum," saying that it "took necessary measures to facilitate the free and open inspection of incoming and outgoing goods by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission," and described the reports submitted by the Korean and Chinese sides to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the rotation and replacement of military personnel and supplies as "false."

　　The "memorandum" also slandered the Korean and Chinese sides, attempting to give the false impression that the US had "no other option" but to violate the armistice agreement and bring new weapons into South Korea to "deal with" the Korean and Chinese sides.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, June 22nd: A British Foreign Office spokesman issued an official statement on the 21st, saying that Britain fully agrees with the US decision to bring new weapons into South Korea.

　　The Foreign Office's statement echoed the US, falsely claiming that the Korean and Chinese sides violated the armistice agreement by bringing in reinforcing weapons.

　　The British Foreign Office spokesman also said that the United States had consulted with Britain before making this decision. At the same time, he stated that Britain is unlikely to send any modern weapons to South Korea as a result of this decision. He said that after the recent withdrawal of the British Commonwealth combat troops from South Korea, Britain only maintains a military liaison delegation there.

### 美方颠倒黑白强词夺理  英国充当美国的啦啦队

　　美方颠倒黑白强词夺理
    英国充当美国的啦啦队
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：在日本的美军当局6月21日以“联合国军司令部”的名义发表了一项“特别备忘录”，用捏造和颠倒黑白的办法来为它破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为作辩解。
    这份“备忘录”清楚地暴露了美方一贯背信弃义的面目。朝鲜停战协定曾经在1953年7月27日由美方代表亲笔签字，但是美方在“备忘录”中却说什么“没有人订的或者天授的法律”使“联合国军”有义务得不到现代武器。
    美方在停战以后擅自将增援武器运进南朝鲜的事实，曾经被朝中方面多次揭发；美方由于害怕中立国监察委员会的视察小组妨碍它偷运武器进南朝鲜，曾经在一年前片面禁止视察小组在南朝鲜进行视察。但是美方居然在“备忘录”中公开撒谎，说它“采取了必要措施来使中立国视察小组便于对运进和运出的货物进行自由的和公开的视察”，并且把朝中方面向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会提出的关于朝中方面军事人员和物资轮换和替换情况的报告说成是“虚假的”。
    “备忘录”还对朝中方面大肆诽谤，企图给人一个虚假的印象：美方除了破坏停战协定和把新武器运进南朝鲜来“对付”朝中方面以外，“别无其他办法”。
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人21日发表正式声明说，英国完全同意美国关于把新式武器运进南朝鲜的决定。
    外交部的声明附和美国，捏造说朝中方面破坏停战协定，运进增援武器。
    英国外交部发言人还说，美国在作出这个决定之前，曾经同英国商量过。同时他表示，英国不可能由于这个决定而运送任何现代武器到南朝鲜去。他说，在最近英联邦战斗部队撤出南朝鲜后，英国在那里只留有一个军事联络代表团。
