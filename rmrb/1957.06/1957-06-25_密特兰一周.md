A Week in the Midlands
By our correspondent Pan Fei

I. The "Black Country"

    The rain came and went, much like the plum rain season in Jiangnan. On a Sunday in mid-May, we left London and began a week-long visit to the English Midlands. The train car windows were covered with water droplets, and the steam from the locomotive rolled close to the ground. After the white steam dissipated, what we saw were plots of grassland separated by fences, wire mesh, and bushes. All green; no crops. This was the main scenery of the English countryside.

    However, as soon as the train passed Coventry, the landscape completely changed. On both sides, we saw factories one after another, and clusters of houses. The continuous buildings continued all the way to the end of the journey: Birmingham.

    We quickly became acquainted with Birmingham's appearance. Near the train station, there were a few short commercial streets that made up the city center. There were many small factories in the city area, but the large factories were all in the suburbs. Except for the city center, the city was almost entirely quiet streets: two-story houses with red brick walls, and lush trees growing in the spaces between the houses. These streets seemed to go on forever... because Birmingham was connected to the nearby cities and towns. Compared with London, the air here was much fresher; the sky also seemed more open.

    We arrived in Birmingham at two o'clock in the afternoon. The rainy day, coupled with it being Sunday, made the streets particularly deserted. Only in front of a movie theater were there a dozen or so people waiting in line to buy tickets. To have lunch, we searched most of the city center, but all the restaurants were closed. Finally, we found a simple cafeteria that was still open, and we quickly went inside. The customers here looked like workers. People greeted us with curious but friendly eyes. We each took a plate and lined up behind the crowd along a long counter. The customers put their plates on the counter and slowly moved forward step by step, like the conveyor belts we later saw in the factories here. Dishes were placed on the counter, and everyone helped themselves. At first, two eggs were placed on the plate; moving forward one step, potatoes were added; another step forward, a glass of orange juice was taken... At the end of the counter, a server calculated the bill based on the colorful food on the plate. The customer paid, and then carried it to a table to enjoy.

    The hotel we stayed in was small, like a country inn. The small elevator, which shook violently like a birdcage, often "stayed put" and could not be used.

    However, we did not complain about these inconveniences in life, nor did we regret coming to Birmingham. Because Birmingham is not famous for its restaurants and hotels, but for its industry. The British proudly call this second largest city in England, second only to London, the "workshop of the world." Birmingham and its vicinity are home to the British automotive, aviation, and machine industries. Austin Motor Company, Dunlop Rubber Company, General Electric Company... are all in Birmingham and its surroundings. The industrial products of this region account for 20% of the total industrial production value of the UK.

    Southeast of Birmingham is another industrial city, Coventry. From Birmingham to the northwest, cities and cities are connected, stretching for dozens of miles to Wolverhampton. This region is the cradle of British heavy industry, and people call it the "Black Country."

    On the second evening after arriving in Birmingham, we entered the middle of the "Black Country" to visit the secretary of the joint trade union of the Asleych-Austin Motor Company, who lived in Halesowen. A local British friend, Williams, accompanied us in his small, paint-peeling car. Leaving the urban area of Birmingham, the hills rose and fell, and the car slid down a slope of twenty degrees like a slide; then it raised its head and roared upwards.

    "This is a genuine proletarian car," Williams stepped hard on the accelerator. The car mustered its strength to climb the slope. "British workers love to drink beer, and my car loves to drink gasoline."

    Being with such an optimistic and humorous elderly man, one would not feel lonely on the journey.

    Both sides of the road were full of trees and houses. Dusk was approaching, and we couldn't see any factories nearby. In less than an hour, we arrived in Halesowen. The first blast furnace in England was built five miles from here.

    After attending a meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Asleych had just returned from France. Early the next morning, he had to go to work at the Austin factory, twenty miles away. The host needed to rest, and the conversation could not be too long. We didn't ask any questions, mainly listening to him introduce the "Black Country" and the Birmingham workers' movement. The following is part of his talk:

    "This is the center of the Midlands. Three hundred years ago, coal and iron ore were discovered here. The coal seam was very thick and of good quality, so coal was used instead of charcoal for iron smelting. Industry developed in the form of family workshops, mainly manufacturing nails for the shipbuilding industry. In this way, the first batch of miners and smelters in England were cultivated."

    "Later, modern machines were used in production. Mines filled the 'Black Country' like honeycombs, and smelting plants were built one after another. Family workshops were replaced by factories, and small producers were greatly hit. People gritted their teeth and left their hometowns to make a living elsewhere, but many people returned to the 'Black Country' with their heads down. Until the end of the nineteenth century, this period of more than a hundred years was the most painful and poorest era for the people of the 'Black Country'."

    "By the beginning of the twentieth century, Birmingham's industry had greatly developed, and our lives had improved. The speed of development was amazing. The Austin factory started producing cars in 1905, manufacturing ten cars per week at that time. Now, in addition to producing 3,500 cars per week, there are also 12,000 various internal combustion engines."

    "With the development of production, the workers of the 'Black Country' have also experienced many changes. When machines were first used, the division of labor was not as refined as it is now. A skilled worker had to be able to do all kinds of work, just like a manual carpenter: able to saw and plane. They were the 'backbone' of the factory, and their wages were much higher than those of unskilled workers. In this way, it was very difficult to carry out the workers' movement. By the beginning of the twentieth century, large-scale production began, and the division of labor became refined. A machine could only manufacture certain parts; a worker only needed to be proficient in a certain production process. Semi-skilled workers became the foundation of the workers. The workers' movement in the 'Black Country' developed, and these semi-skilled workers formed the basic force of the movement."

    "A further development is to 'merge' some individual machines into a special machine - automation. In Birmingham, there are already partially automated factories. An automated machine can continuously perform many processes, but only two people are needed to manage it: one person at the beginning and one person at the end. The requirements for workers have also increased. Semi-skilled workers should not only be skilled workers but also mechanics. The result of automation will be to strengthen the unity of workers and improve their position in the struggle with capitalists. Because in a factory with a relatively high degree of automation, if one link stops working, the production of the entire factory will stop... ."

    Williams friendly "intervened" and asked us to end the visit and let the host rest. Asleych found the blackberry wine he brewed from the cupboard and insisted that we try a glass.

    "This is another product of the 'Black Country'... Cheers!"

    On the way back to Birmingham, when the car was driving on the high ground of the hills, we saw another scenery of the "Black Country": deep in the night, scattered lights, distributed in all directions, boundless like stars in the sky.... (To be continued) (Attached picture)

　　密特兰一周

　　一、“黑国”
    雨时下时歇，活像江南的黄梅季节。5月中旬的一个星期日，我们离开伦敦，开始了为时一周的对中部英格兰的访问。车厢的玻璃窗上沾满了水珠，火车头喷出来的蒸汽紧贴着地面翻滚。当白色的蒸汽消失以后，看到的总是用栅栏、铁丝网和灌木丛间隔起来的一方又一方的草地。一片碧绿；没有庄稼。这就是英格兰原野的主要景色。
    但是，火车一驶过考文垂，大地的面貌就完全改变了。在我们两边闪过的是一个又一个厂房，一簇又一簇住宅。绵延不断的建筑，一直继续到旅途的终点：伯明翰。
    我们很快地认识了伯明翰的面貌。在火车站附近，有几条很短的商业街道，组成了城市的中心区。市区里小工厂很多，但大工厂全在郊外。城市除了中心区以外，几乎都是些僻静的街道：红色砖墙的两层楼住宅，住宅和住宅间的空隙生长着苍葱的树木。这些街道似乎永远没有尽头似的……因为伯明翰同附近的城、镇，都已经联接起来。同伦敦比较，这儿的空气要新鲜得多；天空，也显得更加开阔些。
    我们到达伯明翰的时间是下午两点。雨天，再加上星期日，街道上格外冷清清地，只有一家电影院的门口，有一二十个人在排队买票。为了吃午饭，我们找遍了大半个市中心区，但是所有的饭店，都关着门。最后，我们发现了一家尚在营业的简易食堂，就赶紧闯了进去。这儿的顾客，看模样都是工人。人们用好奇的，但是友善的眼光欢迎我们。我们一人拿了一个盘子，沿着一条长长的柜台，跟在大伙儿的后面排队。顾客都把盘子放在柜台上，一步一步地慢慢儿向前移动，像后来我们在这儿工厂里看到的传送带一样。柜台上放着菜肴，各人自己动手。起初，在盘子里盛上两个鸡蛋；向前挪动一步，添上了土豆；再前一步，取杯桔子水……。到了柜台的尽头，有个服务员根据盘子里五颜杂色的食品算账，顾客付钱，然后自己端到餐桌上去享受。
    我们住的旅馆很小，像是乡间的小客栈。摇幌得很厉害的鸟笼一样的小电梯，经常“原地不动”，不能使用。
    但是，我们没有抱怨这些生活上的不方便，也没有后悔来到伯明翰。因为伯明翰著名的并不是餐厅和旅馆，而是工业。英国人自豪地把这个仅次于伦敦的英格兰第二大城市，叫做“世界的车间”。在伯明翰和它的附近，集中了英国的汽车、航空、机器工业。奥斯汀汽车公司，邓禄普橡胶公司，通用电气公司……都在伯明翰和它的四周。这个地区的工业产品，占全英国工业生产总值的20％。
    伯明翰的东南，是另一工业城市考文垂。从伯明翰往西北，城市和城市连成一片，迤逦几十里，直到瓦浮汉普顿。这个地区，是英国重工业的摇篮，人们把它叫做“黑国”。
    到达伯明翰后的第二个晚上，我们就进入“黑国”的中部，去拜访住在哈塞汶的爱塞雷契—奥斯汀汽车公司联合工会的书记。当地的英国朋友威廉姆斯，驾着他那辆油漆剥落的小汽车，伴送我们。出了伯明翰市区，岗峦起伏，汽车一会儿像坐滑梯一样，顺着二十度的斜坡往下溜去；一会儿又昂着头、吼叫着向上爬。
    “这是辆地道的无产阶级车子。”威廉姆斯使劲踩一下油门。汽车鼓足了劲儿上坡。“英国的工人爱喝啤酒，我的车子爱喝汽油”。
    同这样一位乐观、诙谐的老年人在一起，是不会感到旅途的寂寞的。
    公路的两边，全是树木和住宅。暮色苍茫，看不到附近有没有工厂。不到一小时，我们就到了哈塞汶。英国的第一座鼓风炉，就是在离这儿五英里的地方建立起来的。
    在参加了世界工联的一个会议以后，爱塞雷契刚从法国回来。第二天一早，他又要到离此二十英里的奥斯汀工厂去工作。主人急需休息，谈话的时间不能过长。我们没有提什么问题，主要是听他介绍“黑国”和伯明翰工人运动的情况。下面是他谈话的一部分：
    “这儿是密特兰（即英格兰中部）的中心。三百年以前，这里发现了煤和铁矿。煤层很厚，质量也好，因此就改用煤来代替木炭炼铁。工业在家庭作坊的形式下发展起来，主要是制造钉子，为造船业服务。这样，就培养出英国的第一批矿工和冶炼工人。”
    “后来，在生产中运用了现代机器。矿井像蜂窝一样地布满“黑国”，冶炼厂也一个挨着一个建立起来。家庭作坊被工厂代替了，小生产者受到了很大的打击。人们咬着牙离开家乡，到外地去讨生活，但是很多人又低着脑袋回到“黑国”来。一直到十九世纪末为止，这一百多年的期间，是“黑国”人民最痛苦、最贫困的年代。”
    “到二十世纪初，伯明翰的工业有了大发展，我们的生活才有了改善。发展的速度是惊人的。奥斯汀工厂在1905年开始生产汽车，当时每周制造十辆。现在，除了每周生产三千五百辆汽车以外，还有各种内燃机一万二千部。”
    “随着生产的发展，‘黑国’工人也经历着许多变化。开始使用机器的时候，分工没有现在精细。一个熟练工人，要会做各种各样的活计，就像个手工木匠一样：会锯，会刨。他们是工厂中的“骨干”，工资要比粗工多得多。这样，搞工人运动就很困难。到了二十世纪初，大规模的生产开始了，分工精细了。一部机器，只能制造特定的几种部件；一个工人，也只需熟练某种生产就行了。半熟练工人，便成为工人中的基础。‘黑国’的工人运动发展起来了，这些半熟练工人组成运动的基本队伍。”
    “进一步的发展是，把一些个别的机器，‘合并’成一部特殊的机器——自动化。在伯明翰，已经有了部分自动化的工厂。一部自动化的机器，可以连续地做许多工序，但是只要两个人来管理就行了：一个人在起点一个人在终点。对工人的要求也提高了，半熟练的工人不仅应该是熟练工人，而且是机械师。自动化的结果，将会加强工人的团结，改善他们在同资本家斗争中的地位。因为在一个自动化程度比较高的工厂里，只要一个环节停止了工作，全厂的生产便都停顿了……。”
    威廉姆斯友好地进行“干涉”要求我们结束访问，让主人休息。爱塞雷契从柜子里找出自己酿造的黑莓酒，非要我们尝一杯不可。
    “这是‘黑国’的另一种产品……“干杯！”
    在返回伯明翰途中，当汽车行驶在山岗高处时，我们看到了“黑国”的另一种景色：夜深人静，点点灯火，散布在前后左右，无边无际像满天星斗一样……。　（未完待续）（附图片）
