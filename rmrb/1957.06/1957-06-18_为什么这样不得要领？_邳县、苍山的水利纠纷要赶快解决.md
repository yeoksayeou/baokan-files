　　Why is this Missing the Point?
　　The Water Conservancy Dispute Between Pixian and Cangshan Must Be Resolved Quickly
　　Gao Jian
　　The Pixian and Cangshan areas, where Shandong and Jiangsu provinces border each other, have historically had continuous water conservancy disputes.

　　This year, Cangshan County independently carried out a large-scale enclosure project in the Jiangfengkou flood diversion area. This has greatly increased the threat to farmland in downstream Pixian County, causing opposition from some people in Pixian. In early April, negotiations between the leading departments of the two counties did not yield results. In mid-April, the two sides held a second round of negotiations in Xuzhou, but this also failed to resolve the issue. Therefore, the people of Pixian spontaneously elected representatives to go to Beijing to request the State Council to resolve the matter. The State Council entrusted the Ministry of Water Resources to handle it, and the Ministry of Water Resources notified the Water Resources Departments of Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces to send representatives to negotiate. Seventeen engineering and administrative cadres from the province, special region, and county levels attended the meeting. After more than ten days of surveying and discussion, the problem remained unresolved. At the same time, it was discovered that Pixian County had also carried out some water conservancy projects around the Zhaocunwa area. Therefore, Yixian County, Shandong Province, also asked representatives from both sides to handle this dispute. Because the opinions of the two sides were very far apart, the existing personnel could not handle it, so they had to move the meeting location to Xuzhou. This time, the heads of the Water Resources Departments of the two provinces participated, and the Huai River Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources also sent people to participate, but the problem still could not be resolved. Because one of the larger projects was designed by the Huai River Commission, it was decided to move the meeting location to Bengbu (the location of the Huai River Commission).

　　In order to resolve this water conservancy dispute, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces and relevant water conservancy departments mobilized nearly twenty cadres, spent fifty-five days, and moved the meeting location six times, but still could not resolve the issue. Why is this missing the point? There are three main reasons:

　　First, individual leading comrades participating in the handling of this dispute did not delve into the work deeply enough, only listening to one side of the story. In addition, the localism between the relevant counties made people feel that the two sides were acting somewhat emotionally.

　　Second, some technical cadres deliberately exaggerated the facts and the harm of the other party's projects, complicating the dispute.

　　Third, the Yijia River project was designed by the Huai River Commission, and the impact on the downstream was not considered in the design. It can be said that the initial design was bureaucratic, and when the two provinces had a dispute, they adopted a policy of "conciliation" in an attempt to muddle through. How can the masses' thinking be straightened out? And how can the matter itself be thoroughly resolved?

　　The flood season is approaching, and this water conservancy dispute must be resolved.

　　为什么这样不得要领？
　　邳县、苍山的水利纠纷要赶快解决
　　高鉴
    山东、江苏两省接壤邳县、苍山地区，历史上不断有水利纠纷。
    今年苍山县在江风口分洪区内自行做了大块围田工程，这对下游的邳县农田增加了很大的威胁，引起邳县部分群众反对。4月初，经过两县领导部门协商，未获结果；4月中旬，双方又在徐州进行第二次协商，也未获解决。于是邳县群众自发地选出了代表到北京要求国务院解决，国务院委托水利部处理，水利部又通知山东省水利厅和江苏省水利厅派代表协商，出席这次会议的有省、专区、县的工程人员和行政干部十七人，经过十来天的勘察和讨论，问题依然未得解决。同时，又发现了邳县在赵村洼地区周围做了一部分水利工程，因此，山东省峄县，又要双方代表处理这一纠纷，由于双方的意见距离很大，现有人员处理不了，只好将会议地点迁移徐州，这次会议有两省水利厅厅长参加，水利部治淮委员会也派人参加，还是不能解决问题。因为其中有一项较大的工程是治淮委员会设计的，又决定把会议地点迁到蚌埠（淮委驻地）。
    为了解决这次水利纠纷，江苏、山东两省和有关水利部门，集中了将近二十个干部，先后花了五十五天时间，会议地点迁移了六处，始终不得解决。为什么这样不得要领呢？主要原因有三点：
    一、参加处理这次纠纷的个别领导同志工作不深入，尽听一面之词，再加上有关县之间的本位主义，使人感到双方有些意气用事。
    二、某些技术干部故意夸大事实，扩大对方工程的危害，使纠纷复杂化。
    三、伊家河工程是淮委设计的，在设计时对下游的影响未加考虑。可以说，开始设计时是官僚主义，两省发生纠纷时，又采取了“调和”主义，企图混过关。这叫群众的思想又如何通呢？而就事情本身来说又怎能彻底解决呢？
    汛期在即，这件水利纠纷案不解决是不行了。
