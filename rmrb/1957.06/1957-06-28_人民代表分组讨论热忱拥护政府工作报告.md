Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued today. Representatives held group discussions on the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai.

　　Many representatives in the various groups expressed their enthusiastic support for the report during the discussions. They believed that the report comprehensively summarized the great achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and truthfully examined the shortcomings and errors in the government's work.

　　The representatives also believed that the report's stern criticism of the bourgeois rightists' anti-socialist statements reflected the will of the people and was a profound political and ideological education for the people.

　　Peaceful Transformation Only Possible Under the Leadership of the Communist Party
　　Many Representatives Detailed China's Great Achievements

　　Many representatives from Shandong, Zhejiang, Jilin, Fujian, Hebei, and other representative groups pointed out, with concrete facts, that the achievements of China's socialist revolution and construction were enormous, fully demonstrating the superiority of China's socialist system and the correctness and importance of the Communist Party's leadership. Qian Chongshu, a representative from Zhejiang Province, said that in the process of China's great socialist revolution, social and economic life had not been greatly affected, and such a peaceful revolution was only possible under the leadership of the Communist Party. Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, pointed out that during the First Five-Year Plan, agricultural production increased year by year, many of the most modern factories were built in the industrial sector, and the income of workers and peasants increased year by year. These brilliant achievements gave us great encouragement. At the Shandong Province representative group meeting, Duan Junyi, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and He Jifeng, Deputy Minister of Water Resources, also introduced the major achievements in China's machine building industry and farmland water conservancy, respectively. Gao Shuxun, Deputy Governor of Hebei Province, said that if Hebei Province had experienced such a severe flood last year before liberation, there would have been starvation everywhere, roads would have been cut off, and the world would have been in chaos; but after the disaster in Hebei Province last year, twenty-four provinces across the country transported grain to support Hebei, allowing the disaster victims to overcome the difficulties and maintain social order. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Hebei Province would not have had this blessing.

　　Han En, a representative from Jilin Province and an agricultural labor model, believed that the income of farmers in recent years was not less than that of workers. Taking their agricultural cooperative as an example, in 1955, there was a bumper harvest, and a laborer earned more than one thousand yuan, plus even more income from raising pigs and chickens. Farmers are different from workers; they do not spend money on food, firewood, housing, and water. In the past, they could only eat meat and eggs during festivals, but now their cooperative slaughters large, fat pigs weighing two or three hundred jin for each household during the New Year. Ordinary farm households rarely go a week without eating eggs. The supply and marketing cooperative brings in printed cloth, and the best patterns sell out first. Farmers earn less in disaster years. Last year, Jiaohe County suffered a great disaster, but each household still earned an average of more than five hundred yuan. If they have savings from ordinary times, their lives will not be difficult. Northeastern farmers, recalling the days before liberation when they wore "regeneration cloth" and ate acorn flour, who would not support the Communist Party? He said that only those who used to live by exploiting the people's blood and sweat and now want to go back oppose the Communist Party.

　　Ideology Has Not Yet Entered Socialism
　　Representatives Urgently Felt the Importance of Ideological Remolding of Intellectuals

　　Representatives from Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other representative groups especially felt the importance and urgency of the ideological remolding of intellectuals in their speeches. Yu Pingbo, a representative from Zhejiang, said that some of us intellectuals have a strong bourgeois ideology, which is the market for the rightists to spread fallacies. Yan Jingyao said that he increasingly felt that we as people have already entered socialism, but our ideology has not yet entered socialism. He hoped that everyone would help each other and get rid of the burden of bourgeois ideology in self-struggle and truly remold themselves. Gu Gongxu believed that in recent years, the idea of senior intellectuals burying themselves in their professions and being divorced from politics has slowly emerged again. The problem of arrogance and conceit improved somewhat after the past ideological remolding movement, but it has recently rebounded, which is related to being divorced from politics. In the future, we should focus on ideological remolding. In the Sichuan Province representative group, Peng Dixian hoped that the Ministry of Higher Education would treat the ideological remolding of intellectuals as a long-term, meticulous, and regular task.

　　We Must Not Neglect Exercising Dictatorship Over the Enemy
　　Many Representatives Made Criticisms and Suggestions on Public Security and Other Work

　　At today's group meetings, many representatives, in conjunction with Premier Zhou's report, made criticisms and suggestions on public security work, school education, and other government work. Shen Gunan, a representative from Sichuan Province, cited some recent activities of counter-revolutionary elements as examples to criticize the local public security departments for relaxing public security work. She believed that emphasis should be placed on using persuasion and education to handle internal problems among the people, but we must not allow the neglect of exercising dictatorship over the enemies of the people. Yang Shixian, President of Nankai University, suggested that a complete system should be established for political education in schools in the future, and political education should be systematically carried out from high school to university. Liu Xianzhu, Vice President of Tsinghua University, suggested that the state should continue to run schools for children of workers and peasants and convert some of the current ordinary middle schools into secondary technical vocational schools. Several representatives from the Hubei Province representative group believed that mobilizing the masses to run schools is a good way to supplement the state's efforts and solve the problem of school-age children entering school. Xia Yikun, a representative from Hubei, said that in terms of capital construction, the central government's instructions on reducing non-productive construction standards have now been understood by all parties; however, in terms of productive construction standards and construction, some enterprises and construction units still excessively emphasize mechanization and high standards, thus often causing conflicts with design departments. He suggested that a national simplified standard should be formulated for everyone to follow.

　　Zhu Kezhen, a representative from Zhejiang Province and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that when the Chinese Academy of Sciences was established, there were only two hundred researchers, but now there are more than four thousand seven hundred; at that time, there were only seventeen research institutes, but now there are sixty-six, and the level of research has also improved. Those who believe that China's science has lagged behind in the past eight years simply do not understand the situation. Zhu Kezhen also said that China recently established the Science Planning Commission, which is our country's creation. The Science Planning Commission conducts long-term planning, determines research priorities, coordinates work in all aspects, provides research conditions, conducts international cooperation, establishes science foundations, and trains scientific research cadres. Doing so is very important. Moreover, this work can only be done under the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　Many representatives further refuted the various absurd statements of the rightists with various vivid facts in the discussion. Some representatives believed that the resolute counterattack against the rightists in the Government Work Report made those intermediate elements with blurred understanding better see the facts and brighten their eyes, thus further promoting the unity of the people throughout the country. Shu Xincheng, a representative from Hunan Province, said that this report hit the nail on the head and refuted the rightists effectively. He said that when he first heard the saying "Party's world" and the fallacy that "fixed interest is not exploitation," he only felt that their words were absurd and that they did not even understand common sense. He did not realize that these were major issues of opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the Party. Why is this so? He said this is a matter of stance, a lack of a firm proletarian stance and working-class feelings. He believes that intellectuals must seriously remold themselves. Only with the feelings of the working people can they have the courage to stand up and fight against the rightists.

　　Luo Longji and Huang Shaohong Defended Their Mistakes, Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi Did Not Attend the Meeting, and the Representatives Sharply Criticized Them and Expressed Great Dissatisfaction

　　Many representative groups exposed and criticized the fallacies of rightists such as Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Luo Longji, Long Yun, and Chu Anping. Zheng Zhenduo and Wang Shaoao of the Jiangsu Province representative group both believed that the leadership of the Communist Party and the path of socialism are stipulated in the Constitution. The rightists do not not understand the Constitution, but have ulterior motives. Some people from industrial and commercial circles in the Guizhou Province and Shanghai representative groups exposed the impact of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks on industrial and commercial circles. Wang Xingyao, a representative from Shanghai and a member of industrial and commercial circles, said that an industrialist and businessman in Shanghai whose assets were upside down was still creating trouble despite the government's arrangements. When others tried to persuade him, he asked: Have you read Zhang Naiqi's article? Zhang Naiqi's article caused ideological confusion among students in the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Political School. A student, Huang Miaofu, made absurd remarks, and Zhang Naiqi wrote him a personal letter expressing his support. Huang Miaofu became even more arrogant after receiving this letter. After exposing the bourgeois rightists, Huang Miaofu himself confessed that he had been poisoned by Zhang Naiqi. Wang Xingyao said that Zhang Naiqi's remarks were sugar-coated bullets aimed at industrial and commercial circles. They looked delicious, but eating them would cause poisoning. He wanted us to be nostalgic for capitalism and provoke our resentment towards socialist transformation.

　　Luo Longji and Huang Shaohong defended their mistakes at today's group meeting, and they were sharply criticized by the representatives.

　　Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi did not attend the group meeting, and the representatives from Anhui and Sichuan were very dissatisfied with their behavior. They demanded that Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi should fulfill their duties as representatives and participate in the discussions at the meeting.

　　Tomorrow, the meeting will continue with group discussions.

### 人民代表分组讨论热忱拥护政府工作报告

　　人民代表分组讨论热忱拥护政府工作报告
    新华社27日讯  全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天继续举行，代表们分组讨论了周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。
    各个代表小组的许多代表在讨论的时候，都表示热忱地拥护这个报告。他们认为这个报告全面地总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，实事求是地检查了政府工作的缺点和错误。
    代表们还认为，这个报告对于资产阶级右派分子反社会主义言论的严正批判，反映了全国人民的意志，对于人民也是一次深刻的政治思想教育。
　　和平改造只有在共产党领导下才有可能
　　许多代表具体说明我国的伟大成就
    山东、浙江、吉林、福建、河北等代表小组的许多代表都以具体事实，指出我国社会主义革命和建设的成就是巨大的，充分说明了我国社会主义制度的优越性，说明了共产党领导的正确和重要性。浙江省代表钱崇澍说，在我国社会主义大革命的过程里，社会经济生活没有受到什么影响，这样的和平革命，只有在共产党领导下才有可能。福建省副省长陈绍宽指出，第一个五年计划期间，农业年年增产，工业方面建设了许多最新式的工厂，工人农民的收入年年增加，这些辉煌的成就给我们以很大鼓舞。在山东省代表小组会上，第一机械工业部副部长段君毅、水利部副部长何基沣，还分别介绍了我国机械工业和农田水利方面的重大成就。河北省副省长高树勋说，河北省去年那样严重的水灾，要是在解放以前，一定是饿殍载道、路断人稀、天下大乱；但是去年河北省遭灾后，全国有二十四个省往河北运粮食支援，使灾民们得以度过困难，社会秩序非常稳定。如果不是共产党和人民政府的领导，河北省人民那有这个福气。
    吉林省代表、农业劳动模范韩恩认为，农民几年来的收入并不比工人少。以他们的农业社来说，1955年大丰收，一个劳动力收入一千多元，加上养猪、养鸡的副业收入就更多。农民和工人不一样，吃粮、烧柴、住房、喝水都不花钱。过去逢年过节才能吃到肉和鸡蛋，现在他们社里过年每户杀二、三百斤的大肥猪。普通农户一个星期不吃鸡蛋的很少了。供销社运来花布，那个好那个先卖光。农民逢上灾年收入少一些。去年蛟河县受灾很大，可是每户平均还收入五百多元，如果平时有积蓄，生活就不会发生困难。东北农民想起解放前穿更生布、吃橡子面的日子，谁不拥护共产党——他说，反对共产党的只有那些过去靠剥削人民血汗来生活，现在还想倒退回去的人。
　　思想还没有进入社会主义
　　代表们迫切感到知识分子思想改造的重要
    浙江、四川等代表小组的代表在发言中特别感到知识分子思想改造的重要性和迫切性。浙江代表小组俞平伯说，我们知识分子中有些人有浓厚的资产阶级思想，这就是右派散布谬论的市场。严景耀说，现在越来越感到，我们人已经进入社会主义，而思想却还没有进入社会主义。他希望大家互相帮助，在自我斗争中丢掉资产阶级思想包袱，切实改造自己。顾功叙认为，近年来高级知识分子埋头业务、脱离政治的思想又慢慢地冒出来了。自高自大的毛病，在过去思想改造运动后好了一些，但最近又有抬头，这同脱离政治有关。今后应当抓紧思想改造。在四川省代表小组，彭迪先希望高教部把对于知识分子的思想改造，当成一个长期细致的经常性的工作来作。
　　决不能忽视对敌人实行专政
　　许多代表就公安等工作提出批评和建议
    在今天的小组会上，有许多代表结合周总理的报告就公安工作、学校教育和其他各项政府工作提出了批评和建议。四川省代表沈谷南举出最近发生的一些反革命分子的活动作例，批评地方的公安部门放松了公安工作。她认为，强调用说服教育的方式来处理人民内部问题，但决不能容许忽视对人民的敌人实行专政。南开大学校长杨石先建议，今后学校中的政治教育工作应该确立一个完整的体系，从高中到大学的阶段，应该系统地进行政治教育。清华大学副校长刘仙洲建议国家要继续举办工农子弟中学和把目前一部分普通中学改为中等技术职业学校。湖北省代表小组的好几位代表认为，发动群众办学是补充国家力量的不足、解决学龄儿童入学问题的好办法。湖北代表夏以焜说：在基本建设方面中央关于非生产性建筑标准应该降低的指示现在已为各方面所领会；但是在生产性建筑标准和施工方面，某些企业和施工单位仍然过分强调机械化、高标准，因此同设计部门经常发生矛盾。他建议应当制定一个全国的简化标准，使大家有所遵循。
    浙江省代表、中国科学院副院长竺可桢说，中国科学院成立初期，研究人员只有二百人，现在是四千七百多人；那时研究所只有十七个，现在是六十六个，研究水平也提高了。那些认为八年来中国科学落后了的人，是根本不了解情况。竺可桢还说，我国不久前成立科学规划委员会，这是我们国家的创造。科学规划委员会进行远景规划，确定研究重点，协调各方面工作，提供研究条件，进行国际合作，设立科学基金，培养科学研究干部，这样做非常要紧。而且，这个工作只有在共产党的领导下才能做。
    许多代表在讨论中用各种生动事实进一步驳斥了右派分子的各种荒谬言论。有的代表认为，政府工作报告中对右派分子的坚决反击，使那些认识模糊的中间分子更好地看清了事实，擦亮了眼睛，因而更有利于全国人民的团结。湖南省代表舒新城说，这个报告对右派分子击中了要害，驳斥得有力。他说，当他最初听到“党天下”的说法和“定息不是剥削”的谬论时，他只感到他们的话荒谬，连常识问题都不懂，没有想到这是反对社会主义、反对党的领导的重大问题。为什么会这样呢？他说这是个立场问题，这是缺乏坚定的无产阶级立场和工人阶级的感情，他认为知识分子必须认真改造自己，只有有了劳动人民的感情，才有勇气站出来和右派分子作斗争。
　　罗隆基、黄绍竑为错误辩解，章伯钧、章乃器没有出席会议，代表们予以尖锐批评，表示非常不满
    有不少代表小组对章伯钧、章乃器、罗隆基、龙云和储安平等右派分子的谬论进行了揭发和批判。在江苏省代表小组的郑振铎和王绍鏊都认为，共产党领导、走社会主义道路，是宪法规定的。右派分子不是不懂宪法，而是别有用心。贵州省和上海市代表小组有些工商界人士揭发了章乃器的反动言论对工商界的影响。上海市代表、工商界人士王性尧说，上海一个资产倒挂的工商业者，虽经政府安排，这次还来无理取闹。别人说服他，他反问：章乃器的文章你读过没有？章乃器的文章曾在上海市工商界政治学校的学员中引起了思想混乱。学员黄苗夫发表荒谬言论，章乃器写了一封亲笔信给他，表示要给他撑腰。黄苗夫收到这封信变得更加狂妄。揭露资产阶级右派分子以后，黄苗夫自己检讨说他中了章乃器的毒。王性尧说，章乃器的言论是对工商界的糖衣炮弹，看看好吃，吃了要中毒，他要我们留恋资本主义，挑起我们对社会主义改造的反感。
    罗隆基、黄绍竑在今天的小组会上为他们的错误辩解，受到了代表们尖锐的批评。
    章伯钧和章乃器没有出席小组会，安徽和四川的代表对他们这种行为非常不满。他们要求章伯钧和章乃器应该履行代表的职务，参加会议的讨论。
    明天，会议将继续进行小组讨论。
