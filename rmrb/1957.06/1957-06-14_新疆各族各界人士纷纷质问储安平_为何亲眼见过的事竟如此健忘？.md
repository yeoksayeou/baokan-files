Urumqi, June 13th (Our dispatch) – People of all ethnic groups in Urumqi are refuting Chu Anping and others' anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist arguments.

General Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region and Commander of the Production and Construction Corps, said that at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Mr. Chu Anping believed that "throughout the country, in units large and small, even a section or a group, a Party member must be arranged as the head, and everything, no matter how trivial, must be done according to the color of the Party member." This statement is unreasonable. Now, I won't talk about the national scope, but only take the Production and Construction Corps under my command. Within the Production and Construction Corps, there are uprising troops and elite troops that defended Yan'an during the Liberation War. These troops all have uprising generals serving as commanders at various levels. Mr. Chu Anping stayed in Xinjiang for two years, visited many farms and construction sites, and contacted many commanders. Why did he say things like "Party world"? Could it be that he is so forgetful about the facts he saw with his own eyes?"

At a symposium of employees of all ethnic groups held by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions on the afternoon of the 12th, Wang Baochen, deputy director of the steelmaking workshop of the August 1st Steel Plant, said: Chu Anping's "Party world" is wrong. I am a non-Party cadre, one of the workshop leaders, and I have full authority. Party members and I jointly study and resolve any issues in the workshop. Chu Anping has been to our factory. Hasn't he seen these living facts?

Guan Guizhi, a student in the History and Geography Department of Xinjiang College, said: "I am a Xibe student. From my own life, I have realized that without the Communist Party, there would be no happy life today. Before liberation, my family did not own an inch of land. My parents were forced by life to work for the landlords like cattle and horses. Even so, they could not provide for the whole family and were always short of food and clothing. After liberation, my family was allocated land and joined a senior agricultural cooperative. My family no longer worried about food and clothing, and I even went to college. This was something I never dreamed of in the past. Compared to the past, it can be said that there is a world of difference. If anyone says they don't want the Communist Party to lead, I resolutely answer: 'No way!'" Kurban Raokei (Kazak), an education student at Xinjiang College, said: "Chu Anping's speech is a slander against us. He compared our beloved Chairman Mao to an old monk. Everyone knows that Chairman Mao is very concerned about our ethnic minorities. In Xinjiang, ethnic regional autonomy has been realized, and a large number of ethnic minority cadres have grown up. Xinjiang's politics, economy, and culture are also developing rapidly. We feel extremely warm living in the big family of the motherland. All of this is given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. We regard the Party and Chairman Mao as our reborn parents and saviors. Chu Anping has seen these facts in Xinjiang, but he dares to insult the Party and Chairman Mao. Now I want to ask him, what is the intention of saying these things?"

### 新疆各族各界人士纷纷质问储安平  为何亲眼见过的事竟如此健忘？

　　新疆各族各界人士纷纷质问储安平
　　为何亲眼见过的事竟如此健忘？
    本报乌鲁木齐13日专电　乌鲁木齐市各族各界人士纷纷驳斥储安平等人的反共产党、反社会主义的论调。
    新疆军区副司令员兼生产建设兵团司令员陶峙岳将军说，在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上，储安平先生认为“在全国范围内，无论大小单位，甚至一个科、一个组，都要安排一个党员作头儿，事无巨细，都要看党员的颜色行事。”这种说法是不近情理的。现在我不说全国范围，只拿我指挥的生产建设兵团来说，在生产建设兵团内，有起义队伍，也有在解放战争时期担任保卫延安的劲旅，这些部队都有起义的将领担任各级指挥员。储安平先生在新疆待了两年，访问过许多农场和工地，也接触过许多指挥员，为什么竟说出“党天下”一类的话呢？难道他亲眼见过的事实，竟如此健忘了吗？”
    在新疆维吾尔自治区工会联合会12日下午召开的各民族职工座谈会上，八一钢铁厂炼钢车间副主任王宝琛说：储安平说的“党天下”，是错误的。我是非党干部，是车间领导人之一，完全有职有权，车间有什么事，党员都和我共同研究解决，储安平到过我们的工厂，难道他没有见过这些活生生的事吗？
    新疆学院史地系学生关桂枝说：“我是个锡伯族的学生，从我的切身生活中体会到，没有共产党就没有今天的幸福生活。解放前，我家没有一寸土地，父母为生活所迫像牛马一样的给地主干活，就这样还不能顾上全家的生活，终天缺吃少穿。解放后，我家分了土地，参加了高级农业社，全家才不愁吃不愁穿，我还上了大学。这是过去所梦想不到的事，现在和过去相比真可以说有天渊之别，谁要说不要共产党来领导，我坚决地回答说：“不能。”新疆学院教育系学生库尔班·劳克伊（哈萨克族）说：“储安平的发言对我们是一种污蔑，他把我们各族人民敬爱的毛主席比做老和尚，谁都知道毛主席对我们少数民族是非常关怀的，在新疆，民族区域自治实现了，大批的少数民族干部成长起来了，新疆的政治、经济、文化也在日新月异的发展着，我们生活在祖国的大家庭里感到无比的温暖，这一切都是党和毛主席给我们的，我们把党和毛主席当做再生的父母，救命的恩人。这些事实，储安平在新疆都亲眼见过，可是他竟敢来污辱党，污辱毛主席，现在我要问他讲这些话的用意何在？
