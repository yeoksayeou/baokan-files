Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: At the enlarged meeting of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League held tonight, a resolution was unanimously adopted demanding that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League immediately convene a meeting to express its attitude towards the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun and others, draw a clear line with Zhang Bojun and others, and clarify its position.

The resolution stated that the anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary remarks made by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and others have led the masses to suspect that these remarks represent the opinions of the League organization, thus creating an extremely adverse impact among the people. Members of the League's grassroots organizations in Beijing have requested the Municipal Committee to forward a request to the Central Committee to immediately convene a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee to express its attitude towards these remarks, review its work, and improve its leadership. The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee convened an enlarged meeting on the 15th of this month and unanimously agreed to the legitimate demands of the members of the grassroots organizations, requesting the Central Committee to immediately convene an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee to express its attitude towards these anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary remarks, draw a clear line, clarify its position, and call on League organizations across the country to conduct discussions, severely refute these anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary remarks, and expose the two-faced tactics of right-wing ambitious elements. To distinguish right from wrong, raise awareness, resolutely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and resolutely follow the socialist road.

Tao Dayong, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: It now appears that right-wing elements in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League have occupied a certain position. This is not a simple problem. We should urge the Central Committee of the China Democratic League from the bottom up to lead us to continue on the socialist road. Wen Jiasi, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Chen Shihua, Vice Chairman of the Cultural and Educational Committee, and Hou Dagian, Deputy Director of the Organization Department, and others believe that there are still some people within the China Democratic League who hold the same ideas as Zhang Bojun and others. They believe that these people should wake up, clarify their positions, and not continue to go astray. Chen Shouqi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: It seems that their speeches were planned. Chen Xingui talked about fundamental issues, Zhang Bojun talked about politics, Chu Anping talked about administration, and Luo Longji talked about the judiciary. Many speakers also pointed out that Zhang Bojun's self-criticism was perfunctory, attempting to muddle through. They also demanded that Zhang Bojun and others honestly examine themselves.

Feng Yidai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: According to my understanding, Chen Renbing and Chen Xingui, who made reactionary remarks, have close ties with Luo Longji, and Luo Longji has also read Chu Anping's speech. Their actions deserve our vigilance.

Wu Han, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, called on everyone at the end of the meeting to stand on the position of the country and socialism, vigorously defeat two-faced people, and expose their tactics of saying one thing to your face and another behind your back.

　　吴晗在民盟北京市委扩大会上号召
    大力击败两面派
    据新华社15日讯　今天晚上召开的民盟北京市委扩大会议上，一致通过决议要求民盟中央立即召开会议对章伯钧等人的反动言论表明态度，和章伯钧等人划清界限，明确立场。
    决议里说，章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平等人发表的反党反社会主义的反动言论，使人民群众怀疑这些言论代表了盟组织的意见，因此在人民群众中产生了极其恶劣的影响。北京市盟的各基层组织的盟员纷纷要求市委会转请盟中央立即召集中央常务委员会对这些言论表明态度，检查工作，改进领导。北京市委员会常务委员会于本月15日召开了扩大会议，一致同意各基层组织盟员的正当要求，提请中央立即召开中央常务委员会扩大会议，对这些反党反社会主义的反动言论，表明态度，划清界限，明确立场，并号召全国各地盟组织进行讨论，对这些反党反社会主义的反动言论，予以严厉驳斥，对右派野心分子的两面作法，予以揭发。以分清是非，提高认识，坚决接受中国共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路。
    民盟北京市委副主委陶大镛说：现在看来民盟中央右派分子已经占了一定的地位，这是个不简单的问题，我们应当由下而上地督促民盟中央领导我们继续走社会主义的道路。民盟北京市委副主委闻家驷、文教委员会副主委陈士骅、组织部副部长侯大乾等人认为在民盟内部还有一些人和章伯钧等人抱有相同的思想，他们认为这些人应觉悟过来，表明立场，不要继续走入歧途。民盟北京市委宣传部副部长陈寿琦说：看来他们的发言好像是有计划的，陈新桂谈根本问题，章伯钧谈政治，储安平谈行政，罗隆基谈司法。在许多人发言中也指出章伯钧的检查是敷衍了事，企图蒙混过关。并要求章伯钧等人要老老实实检查自己。
    民盟北京市委副秘书长冯亦代说：据我了解发表反动言论的陈仁炳、陈新桂都和罗隆基有密切的关系，而储安平的发言罗隆基也看过，他们的行动值得我们警惕。
    民盟北京市委主任委员吴晗在会议结束时号召大家站在国家和社会主义立场大力击败两面派，揭露他们表面一套，背后一套的手法。
