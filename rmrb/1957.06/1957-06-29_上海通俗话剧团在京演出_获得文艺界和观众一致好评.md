　　Shanghai Popular Drama Troupe Performs in Beijing
　　Receives Unanimous Praise from Literary and Art Circles and Audiences
　　(Our Newspaper) Beijing News – The Shanghai Popular Drama Touring Troupe, which came to Beijing to give report-back performances, began public performances of its first play, "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma," at the China Youth Art Theatre on the 26th, and received a warm welcome from the audience. After watching their performance on the 26th, Vice Premier Chen Yi met with all the actors, congratulated them on the success of their performance, and encouraged them to work harder for the cause of popular drama.
　　Popular drama is the earliest form of modern drama in China, with a history of fifty years. It inherits the tradition of national opera in art and has its own characteristics and style. In the past, due to the destruction of the reactionary rulers, it once tended to decline. After liberation, it did not receive the support it deserved until a viewing and performance meeting was held in Shanghai this year, and it regained its brilliance.
　　This troupe is composed of existing veteran popular drama artists Chen Wuyi, Wang Meiyu, Tian Chi, Dong Tianmin, Liu Yixin, Qin Haha, Wang Xueyan, and Wang Manjun.
　　On the afternoon of the 22nd, twelve drama theaters and troupes, including the China Youth Art Theatre in the capital, jointly held a welcome tea party. At the meeting, Jiao Juyin, vice president of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the hosts, introducing the characteristics of popular drama performance art. He hoped that the capital's drama actors could learn from them. Ma Yanxiang also gave a detailed introduction and analysis of the history and characteristics of popular drama, criticized the sectarianism of the past in art, and called on everyone to give strong support to this "resurrected" drama genre.

　　上海通俗话剧团在京演出
    获得文艺界和观众一致好评
    本报讯　来京汇报演出的上海市通俗话剧巡回演出团，26日起在中国青年艺术剧院剧场公演了第一个剧目“张文祥刺马”，获得了观众热情的欢迎。陈毅副总理在26日看了他们的演出后，接见了全体演员；祝贺他们演出的成功，并鼓励他们为通俗话剧事业更好的努力。
    通俗话剧是我国现代话剧最早的形式，已有五十年历史；它在艺术上继承了民族戏曲的传统，而有着自己的特点和风格。过去因受到反动统治者的摧残，一度趋于衰落，解放后，没有得到应有的扶植与支持，直到今年在上海举行一次观摩会演后，才又重新发出了光彩。
    这个剧团是由现有的通俗话剧老艺人陈旡我、王美玉、田驰、董天民、刘一新、秦哈哈、王雪艳、王曼君等人组成的。
    22日下午，首都中国青年艺术剧院等十二个话剧院、团联合举行了欢迎茶会，在会上，北京人民艺术剧院副院长焦菊隐代表主人致欢迎词，介绍了通俗话剧表演艺术上的特点；他希望首都话剧演员们能够很好地向他们学习。马彦祥对通俗话剧的历史和特点，也作了详尽的介绍和分析，批判了过去艺术上的宗派主义，并呼吁大家对这一“起死回生”的话剧流派，给以大力的支持。
