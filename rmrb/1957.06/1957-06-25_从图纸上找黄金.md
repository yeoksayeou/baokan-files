Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 23rd. "Finding Gold in Blueprints" is the slogan put forward by the builders of the new thermal power plant in Baotou to implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily.

　　In the past two months, the technicians and workers building this thermal power plant have modified eighty-three construction projects for this year, which can save more than 1.24 million yuan in investment. From the revised design, it can be seen that the decorative part of the original design has been greatly simplified; equipment with excessive standby or safety factors has been reasonably reduced; and construction according to the revised design can also save 425 tons of steel and 206 tons of cement.

　　The new thermal power plant in Baotou is a large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plant. Its power generation capacity is about five times the existing power generation capacity of Baotou City. Although the original design has been greatly modified this year, the power generation capacity of this thermal power plant will not be reduced, and safe production can still be guaranteed.

　　The technicians of this thermal power plant happily told Xinhua News Agency reporters that the transformers, water pumps and other equipment they saved have been used to support units in urgent need such as the Tianjin Power Plant.

　　The workers of this thermal power plant also plan to change the coal storage yard and coal transportation system, which were originally planned to be completed in one phase, to phased construction according to the phased construction of generators and boilers. This will also save a lot of funds for the country.

　　从图纸上找黄金
    新华社包头23日电“从图纸上找黄金”，这是包头新建热电站的建设者为贯彻勤俭办企业的方针而提出的口号。
    建设这个热电站的技术人员和职工们，在最近两个月中对今年施工中的八十三项工程项目进行了修改，可以节省投资一百二十四万多元。从修改后的设计可以看出，原设计中的装饰部分被简化了很多；备用或安全系数过大的设备，合理地减少了；按照修改后的设计进行施工，还可以节省钢材四百二十五吨，水泥二百零六吨。
    包头新建热电站是一座规模巨大的高温高压热电站。它的发电能力约等于包头市现有发电能力的五倍。今年虽然对原设计进行了较大的修改，但是这座热电站的发电能力将不会减少，并且还能保证安全生产。
    这个热电站的技术人员愉快地向新华社记者说，他们节省下来的变压器、水泵等器材，已经支援了天津发电厂等急需的单位。
    这个热电站的职工还计划把原来决定一次建完的储煤场、输煤系统等，根据发电机和锅炉分期建设的情况，改为分期建设，这样，还将为国家节省大量资金。
