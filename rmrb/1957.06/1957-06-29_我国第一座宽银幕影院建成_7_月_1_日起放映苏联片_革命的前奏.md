　　China's First Wide-Screen Cinema Completed
    Soviet Film "Prelude to Revolution" to be Screened from July 1st
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) China's first wide-screen stereophonic cinema has been completed in Beijing. It will open on July 1st and screen the Soviet color film "Prelude to Revolution." Two wide-screen color short films produced by China itself, "May Day 1957" and "Sunday in Beijing," will also be shown to the capital's audience at this cinema.
    This cinema was rebuilt from the original Capital Cinema. The reconstruction project was led by architect Liu Shiming, who designed the cinema more than twenty years ago.
    The huge wide screen is sixteen meters wide and five point seven meters high (the original screen was six meters wide and four point five meters high). The wide screen is curved and made of aluminum with dense gold wire mesh, so the pictures projected are brighter than those on ordinary screens but do not irritate the eyes. The stage curtain is electrically operated.
    Behind the screen, there are three sets of loudspeakers, and around the walls inside the auditorium and on the ceiling, there are also many small loudspeakers, forming a stereophonic transmission network. The dialogue of characters in the film, following the position of the acting roles, comes from the left, center, or right. The sound effects of crowds cheering, wind, rain, thunder and lightning, airplane sounds, train sounds, fountains, birdsong, and cicadas, will be transmitted from the front, back, left, and right of the audience. The entire cinema has been re-equipped with sound-absorbing equipment, and this cinema facing the street will not be disturbed by any city noises.
    The rebuilt cinema has one thousand two hundred seats. The cinema is equipped with the latest "forced convection" ventilation equipment. The audience will be constantly breathing fresh air while watching the film.

　　我国第一座宽银幕影院建成
    7月1日起放映苏联片“革命的前奏”
    本报讯　我国第一座宽银幕立体声电影院，已经在北京建成。7月1日开幕，将放映苏联彩色影片“革命的前奏”。我国自己摄制的两部宽银幕五彩短片“1957年五一节”和“北京的星期天”，将在这座影院先后同首都观众见面。
    这座影院是由原来的首都电影院改建的。主持改建工程的是二十多年前设计这座影院的建筑师刘世铭。
    巨大的宽银幕，有十六公尺宽，五点七公尺高（原来的银幕宽六公尺，高四点五公尺）。宽银幕是弧形的，铝制，上有致密金丝网纹，放映出来的画面，较之普通幕布明亮而不刺激眼睛。台口帷幕由电气操纵。
    银幕后面有三组扬声器，观众厅四周墙壁内及顶棚，还有许多小型扬声器，构成了立体声的传送网。影片中人物对话，随着角色行动的位置，从左边、中央或右边发出，群众欢呼、风雨雷电、飞机声、火车声、喷泉洒落、鸟语蝉鸣等音响效果，将从观众的前后左右传送出来。整个影院重新装置了吸音设备，这座临街的影院将不受任何市声杂音的干扰。
    改建后的影院有一千二百个座位。院内装置了最新式的“强制对流”通风设备。观众在看影片时将始终呼吸着新鲜空气。
