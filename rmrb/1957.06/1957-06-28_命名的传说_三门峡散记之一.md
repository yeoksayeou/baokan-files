　　The Legend of Naming
　　——Random Notes on Sanmenxia (1)
　　Lei Jia
　　The newly built houses appeared, and then there was the first post office here. The post office clerk – the only clerk – denied this statement. According to his view, it should be said like this: "Building houses is a later thing. When the first tent was set up, it wasn't even..." He shook his head and continued somewhat annoyed: "When the first worker appeared on the construction site, I was already here."

　　Indeed, it was as he said. At that time, he was a postman. Every day, neither early nor late, as soon as the noon meal bell rang, you could see him pushing his cart.

　　The cart was green and very conspicuous; the green mailbag was even more eye-catching. He took out letters from the mailbag. The letters were addressed to this person's name or that person's name. Every name was addressed with a loving salutation. Moreover, after the place name Sanmenxia appeared in "reports," everyone knew it; but the senders still couldn't immediately find it on the map. Therefore, these three characters were written somewhat awkwardly. Strangely, when it was already written on the envelope, every sender immediately heard the sound of the rolling Yellow River.

　　The sound of the Yellow River was really ringing behind the postman at this time. Because he was standing facing the construction site canteen: he took out stamps, postcards, money orders, insured envelopes... from the mailbag we just saw. The workers gathered around, and they concentrated all kinds of wishes leading to the whole country on the postman. The torrent of emotions overwhelmed him, so much so that he couldn't even hear the sound of the Yellow River rushing behind him.

　　One day another postman replaced him, and then someone asked: "Where is that postman?" Then, recalling what the first postman looked like in their mind, many people couldn't remember. They only knew that one had left and this one had arrived.

　　The one who left - he went to the first Shijiatan Post Office that appeared. The post office was not big, you could say it was the smallest post office. Because it only had one clerk, and in the newly built bamboo and adobe house, it only had a small storefront. A green mailbox hung up, and that was the beginning of business. After lunch, after dinner, especially on rest days, a queue often formed at its door. The sound of explosions on the construction site became more and more frequent every day, and its queue became longer and longer every day.

　　The door seemed low, and every person who walked in could only see a pile of packages high on a wooden shelf. There were so many packages, some big, some small, as if they would never be finished being taken. The counter was built of adobe bricks, with a wooden board placed on top. No one knew why the counter had to be built so high, so the table inside the counter seemed very low. People who walked in could only see a tuft of the clerk's hair. He lowered his head, writing non-stop with one hand, and satisfying everyone's various requests with the other. It seemed that no one had ever scrutinized his face, and in fact, he didn't have time to look at everyone who walked in. Only when he got off work and stretched his sore back from the chair would he stare blankly at the counter, which was smeared with paste.

　　It is said that a young worker who had built the Guanting Reservoir came to Sanmenxia. This young man saw the Yellow River for the first time when he crossed the Yellow River Bridge. It was winter, and he imagined the scene of flooding during the flood season: the floodwaters rolled down from the riverbed above the ground, inundating vast fields. He even heard the cries for help from thousands upon thousands of people at the same time. The Yellow River in front of him was a different sight. It squeezed its waist in the deep ravine, twisting and turning, sometimes advancing slowly, sometimes rushing rapidly. Like an earth dragon wearing protective colors, it lurked in the plateau ravine. The waves splashing on the rocks, like its glittering eyes, revealed its wild nature.

　　This young worker, standing on the steep cliff of Sanmenxia, made up his mind. Undoubtedly, the great achievements of Niangniang Temple aroused his pride. His deep black eyes gazed for a long time at the horseshoe print on Guimen Island. He thought that this horse must have galloped from the plateau on the right bank, its first hoof landed on Guimen Island, and then it leaped to the left bank. Its span was at least five hundred meters, and the size and depth of the hoof print made him imagine that this was a tall horse, and the one riding on the horse must be a giant. But this giant was no longer Da Yu, but himself.

　　After all, Da Yu's divine power could not open up the Sanmen, but he was going to level the Sanmen Island and build a flood control dam here.

　　This young worker had long lost his relatives, and only had a friend who was better than a relative. He wanted to write him a letter, he wanted to tell this comrade-in-arms who was reclaiming the frontier: You have opened up one barren field after another; so have I, I came to Sanmenxia as soon as the Guanting Reservoir was completed.

　　But he didn't write. He hesitated. One night, in the roaring wind, he seemed to hear the roaring sound of the Yellow River, followed by the sound of steel rails being beaten like a torrential rain. This was the alarm. He saw the river water filled the ravine, the "Mid-stream Pillar" was already submerged, the "Dressing Table" was only showing its sharp tip, and Guimen Island and Shenmen Island (note) were shaking like candlesticks in an earthquake... Suddenly he woke up, it turned out he was dreaming. He pushed open the door and walked out, and a piece of crystal-white moonlight fell on his face. The Yellow River flowing under his feet, which looked so turbid and terrible during the day, unexpectedly shone with a layer of bronze-like light waves at this time. The magnificent and lovely scenery, like a drop of sweet dew dripping into his heart, moved him to tears.

　　The frightened mood just now disappeared. He seemed to see a deep green lake unfolding under his feet. A gust of breeze came, like a whisper - this may be the hope sent by the eighty million people downstream in their dreams. (To be continued tomorrow)

　　命名的传说
　　——三门峡散记之一
　　雷加
    新造的房子出现的时候，这里才有了第一个邮局。邮局的办事员——唯一的一个办事员，却否认这种说法。依照他的见解应该这样说：“造房子这是后来的事，搭第一个帐篷的时候，也不……”他摇了摇头，有些气恼地接着说：“工地上出现第一个工人的时候，我就来了。”
    的确像他说的。那时，他是一个邮递员，每天不早不晚，一敲响午饭的钟声，就看见他推着车子来了。
    车子是绿色的，非常显眼；绿色的邮包，更加吸引人的眼睛。他从邮包里掏出了信件。信件上写着这个人的名字，或那个人的名字。对于任何名字，都是亲爱的称呼。再说，三门峡这个地名，从在“报告”中出现以后，没有人不知道了；但是寄信人还是不能马上就在地图上找到它。因此，这三个字写起来总有些生疏。奇怪的是，当它已经写在信封上的时候，每个寄信人又立刻听见了滚滚流去的黄河的声音。
    黄河的声音，这时真的在邮递员的背后响着了。因为他面对着工地食堂站着：他从我们刚才看见的邮包内，拿出了邮票、明信片、汇款单、保价信封……工人们围上来，他们把通向全国的各种心愿，集中邮递员的身上。感情的洪流淹没了他，甚至他连背后黄河奔流的声音也听不见了。
    有一天换了另一个邮递员，这时有人问到：“那一个邮递员呢？”接着在心里回想头一个邮递员是什么样子，很多人想不出来。只知道那一个走了，这一个来了。
    那一个走了——他是到第一个出现的史家滩邮局去了。邮局不大，可以说是最小的一个邮局。因为它只有一个办事员，它在新造的竹材土坯的房子里，也仅有一间小小的门面。一只绿色邮箱挂起来，就算开始营业了。午饭后，晚饭后，尤其在休息日，在它的门口常常排起队伍。工地上爆破声一天比一天频繁起来，它的队伍也一天比一天长起来。
    门显得低矮，每个人走进去，只见一只木架子上高高地堆着包裹。那么多的包裹，有大的，有小的，仿佛永远取不完。柜台是用土坯砌起来的，上面搁着一块木板。不知为什么柜台要砌得那么高，因此柜台里的那张桌子，就显得十分低了。走进来的人，只能看见办事员的一撮头发。他低着头，一只手不停地写着，另一只手满足着每个人的各种要求。好像没有人端详过他的面孔，事实上他也没有时间去看走进来的每一个人。只是当他下班之后，从那只椅子上伸起酸懒的腰杆时，才对着被浆糊涂得乱七八糟的柜台，出一会神。
    却说一个建筑过官厅水库的年青工人，到三门峡来了。这个年青人过黄河大桥时，才第一次见过黄河。那是冬天，他想像着汛期泛滥的景象：洪水从高出地面的河床上滚下来，淹没了广大的田野。他甚至同时听见了数千数万人民呼救的声音。眼前的黄河，却是另一个样子。它在高深的壑谷中，挟紧了腰身，扭转着，弯曲着，有时迂缓地前进，有时又急湍地奔流。如同一只披着保护色的土龙，在高原壑谷中潜行。岩石上溅起的浪花，就像它的闪光的眼睛，泄露了它的狂野的本性。
    这位年青工人，站在三门峡的陡崖上，下了决心。无疑的，娘娘河的伟迹，激起了他的骄傲。他那双深黑色的眼睛，长久地凝视着鬼门岛上那只马蹄印。他想，这匹马一定是由右岸高原上飞奔而来，它的第一只蹄子落在鬼门岛上，然后纵身跃到左岸去了。它的跨度至少有五百米，蹄印的大小和深度，使他想见这是一匹高头大马，骑在马背上的一定是位巨人。但是这位巨人不再是大禹，而是他自己了。
    大禹的神力毕竟不能开凿三门，而他却要削平三门岛，在此建筑起一座拦洪大坝来。
    这位年青工人，早已没有了亲人，只有一位胜似亲人的朋友。他想给他写一封信，他要告诉这位开垦边疆的战友说：你开了一块荒田又一块荒田；我也一样，官厅水库刚刚完成，就到三门峡来了。
    但是他没有写。他迟疑着。有天晚上，他在怒吼的风声中似乎听见了黄河咆哮的声音，接着骤雨一般的敲打钢轨的声音也响起来了。这是警号。他看见河水塞满了壑谷，“中流砥柱”早已淹没了，“梳装台”仅仅露着尖顶，鬼门岛和神门岛（注）就像地震中的蜡台一样，摇摇欲坠……忽然他惊醒了，原来是在做梦。他推开房门走了出来，迎面落下一片白晶晶的月光。在他脚下流过的黄河，白天显得如此浑浊可怕，想不到这时它却闪着一层黄铜般的光波。瑰丽可爱的景色，如同一滴甘露滴进了他的心胸，他感动得落下泪来。
    刚才惊悸的心情消失了。他仿佛望见了一片深绿色的湖水，从脚下展开。荡来一阵阵清风，像是微语——这也许是下游八千万人民在梦中寄来的希望。  （明日续完）
    （注）三门峡几块岩石的名称。
