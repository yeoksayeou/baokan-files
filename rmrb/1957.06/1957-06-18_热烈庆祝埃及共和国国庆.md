　　Warmly Celebrate the National Day of the Republic of Egypt
　　President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association, Bao Erhan
    Today is the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Egypt after the overthrow of the Farouk feudal dynasty. We celebrate the National Day of the Republic of Egypt on the day Egypt achieved a great victory in resisting aggression, which has even greater significance. Four years ago, the Egyptian people completely shattered the chains around their necks imposed by the Farouk dynasty, and today they have also broken the handcuffs imposed on them by British and French colonialism. An independent and autonomous New Egypt, like the morning sun breaking through dark clouds, is rising from the East.

    I deeply felt the heroic spirit and sincere friendship of the Egyptian people during my visit to Egypt last autumn. Although I only spent a short time with the women and youth volunteers of Cairo University, their determination to dedicate themselves to defending the independence and freedom of their motherland, and their sincere desire to unite with peace-loving people, deeply moved me. This noble spirit of theirs is also the spirit I felt from President Nasser and all my Egyptian friends. It was because I personally felt this spirit that, during Egypt's most difficult days, although I was very concerned about my friends, I firmly believed that they would achieve final victory. My belief finally became a reality. World history has recorded such a glorious page: in this heroic country with a long history and culture, with the support of the people of the world, it defeated the joint attack of three aggressor countries and defended its independence and world peace.

    Recalling the days of the Egyptian people's arduous struggle, the Chinese people showed deep sympathy and support for their heroic resistance to aggressors. Our government has issued statements more than once to support Egypt and protest against the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression; millions of people in more than thirty cities held demonstrations to support Egypt and oppose Anglo-French aggression; more than 120 million young people, more than 10 million Chinese Muslims, and millions of workers and women expressed their determination to go to the banks of the Nile to fight alongside the Egyptian people against the aggressors when necessary. More than 3,000 doctors from Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Changsha had voluntarily organized volunteer medical teams, ready to go to the Egyptian front line if needed.

    The heroic behavior of the Egyptian people deeply moved and inspired us. The friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people has a history of thousands of years. And today, as the two countries have gained independence and liberation and support each other in the struggle, the friendship between the two peoples has entered a new stage in history. Friendship tested by battle is the most profound and lasting friendship. In many complex and arduous struggles to come, this friendship will become more and more consolidated and deepened. We know that the colonialists will never be reconciled to our victory. They are plotting to create Hungarian and Jordanian incidents around the world, and are promoting new colonialism by promoting the Eisenhower Doctrine and intensifying the establishment of military bases in other countries. Therefore, we and the people of Egypt and the world must unite more closely, be more vigilant, and support each other in future struggles to achieve greater victories. Our solidarity with the people of Arab countries on the basis of safeguarding national independence and sovereignty and maintaining world peace cannot be undermined by any conspiracy of the colonialists. Because the people will not allow it.

    The implementation of the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement and Trade Agreement has played a significant role in deepening our two countries' understanding and cooperation. The Chinese people are enthusiastically preparing to welcome the Egyptian art troupe, cultural delegation, and other delegations that will implement the cultural agreement. We are even more eagerly awaiting President Nasser's visit.

    Today, under the leadership of President Nasser, the heroic Egyptian people are carrying out large-scale construction. They will build hundreds of houses on the ruins of Port Said, and build huge factories in Cairo and other cities. How shameless and powerless does the invaders' indiscriminate bombing appear in the face of the Egyptian people's strong will! Under the resolute struggle of the Egyptian people, the conspiracy of internationalizing the Suez Canal failed. Britain, the United States, and France were forced to allow their ships to pay obediently according to the will of the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people decided to use the income from the canal to build the huge Aswan Dam project. The United States refused to aid this project because it could not meet its unreasonable demands. Today, facts prove that as long as the control of colonialism is shaken off, the people have enough power to build their own country. Today, the United States' attempt to enslave other countries with so-called "economic assistance" has also been thwarted in Egypt.

    We warmly congratulate the Egyptian people on their great achievements in economic construction.
    Congratulations on the further development of Sino-Egyptian friendship.
    Congratulations to Egypt on its great contribution to maintaining peace in the Middle East and the world.
    Congratulations on President Nasser's health!

### 热烈庆祝埃及共和国国庆

　　热烈庆祝埃及共和国国庆
　　中埃友好协会会长　包尔汉
    今天是埃及推翻法鲁克封建王朝建立共和国的四周年。我们在埃及取得反抗侵略的伟大胜利的日子里来庆祝埃及共和国国庆，有着更重大的意义。四年前，埃及人民彻底粉碎了法鲁克王朝套在他们脖子上的锁链，今天他们又砸掉了英、法殖民主义加给他们的手铐。一个独立自主的新埃及，像朝阳冲破乌云一样，从东方升起来了。
    埃及人民的英雄气魄和真挚友情，我在去年秋天访问埃及的日子里就深深地体会到了。我和开罗大学的妇女、青年义勇军虽然只相处了一个短短的时间，但是他们那誓为保卫祖国独立自由而献身的决心，那要求与爱好和平人民团结的真诚愿望，深深地打动了我。他们这种崇高的精神，也就是我从纳赛尔总统以及所有埃及朋友们那里感受到的精神。正是由于我亲身感受到了这种精神，所以在埃及最艰难的日子里，我虽然非常挂念我的朋友们，但是我坚决相信他们一定能取得最后的胜利。我的信念终于变成了现实。世界历史上已经记录下这样一页光辉的史篇：在这个有着悠久历史文化的英雄国家，在全世界人民的支持下打败了三个侵略国的联合进攻，保卫住了自己的独立与世界和平。
    回忆在埃及人民艰苦斗争的日子里，中国人民对他们英勇抗击侵略者的行动，表现了深刻的同情和支持。我国政府不止一次发表声明支援埃及，抗议英法以侵略行为；三十几个城市的几百万人民，举行了支援埃及、反对英法侵略的游行示威；一亿二千多万的青年、一千多万的中国穆斯林，以及千百万的工人和妇女都纷纷表示决心，准备在必要的时候，到尼罗河畔去同埃及人民并肩抗击侵略者。广州、上海、长沙的三千多名医生，就曾自动地组织志愿医疗队，准备一旦需要，就到埃及前线去。
    埃及人民的英雄行为，深深激动和鼓舞了我们。中、埃两国人民的友谊，已经有几千年的历史。而在两个国家各自争取到独立解放并在斗争中相互支持的今天，两国人民的友谊，已走上了历史的新阶段。经过战斗考验的友谊，是最深刻持久的友谊。在今后的许多复杂艰巨的斗争中，这种友谊还会愈益巩固和加深。我们知道，殖民主义者对于我们的胜利是决不会甘心的。他们正阴谋在全世界制造匈牙利事件和约旦事件，并且用推销艾森豪威尔主义和加紧在他国建立军事基地等办法来推行新的殖民主义。因此，我们和埃及以及全世界人民就要团结得更紧密，加倍提高警惕，并在今后的斗争中相互支持，以取得更大的胜利。我们和阿拉伯国家人民在保卫民族独立主权、维护世界和平的基础上的团结，是殖民主义者任何阴谋也破坏不了的。因为人民不答应。
    中埃文化合作协定和贸易协定的执行，对于加深我们两国的了解与合作，起了重大的作用。中国人民正热烈准备着欢迎执行文化协定的埃及艺术团、文化代表团以及其他代表团。我们更热切地在期待着纳赛尔总统的访问。
    今天英雄的埃及人民在纳赛尔总统的领导下，正进行着大规模的建设。他们要在塞得港的废墟上，建立起千百幢房屋，在开罗和其他城市里建立起巨大的工厂。侵略者的狂轰滥炸，在埃及人民坚强的意志面前显得多么无耻，多么无力！在埃及人民坚决的斗争下，苏伊士运河国际化的阴谋失败了。英、美、法被迫不得不允许他们的船只，按照埃及人民的意志而驯驯服服地付款了。埃及人民决定把运河的收入来兴修阿斯旺水坝的巨大工程。美国曾因达不到自己无理的要求，而拒绝援助这个工程。今天事实证明，只要摆脱殖民主义的控制，人民是有足够力量来建设自己的国家的。今天美国企图用所谓“经济援助”来奴役他国的诡计，在埃及也碰壁了。
    我们热烈祝贺埃及人民在经济建设中的伟大成就。
    祝贺中埃友谊的进一步发展。
    祝贺埃及对维护中东及世界和平的巨大贡献。
    祝贺纳赛尔总统的健康！
