How to Solve the Difficulties of Small and Medium Industrial and Commercial Business Owners?
Xiang De, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce

Small and medium industrial and commercial business owners account for more than 90% of the industrial and commercial sector nationwide. What is their position in society? What are their living conditions? What are their demands? How can these be resolved? These questions should be given full attention. I will share my personal opinions on these issues.

The Position of Small and Medium Industrial and Commercial Business Owners in Society

Under the capitalist system of the old society, everything was free competition, everyone for themselves. Capitalists not only cruelly exploited workers, but also fought among themselves, not hesitating to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In a society of "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp," small and medium industrial and commercial business owners were the victims of competition, the vast majority being "shrimp," and only a few lucky ones being "small fish." They struggled daily on the verge of bankruptcy, never knowing what tomorrow would bring. Therefore, in the old society, from the perspective of socio-economic status, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners were a class that was ruled, oppressed, and plundered.

Many small and medium industrial and commercial business owners, due to their small capital and limited possession of the means of production, had to directly engage in enterprise labor to maintain their livelihoods. Many of their family members also directly participated in enterprise labor. Some people invested in partnership enterprises and became capital-side employees, mainly using their shareholding to secure a job. Therefore, from the perspective of social class composition, these small and medium industrial and commercial business owners belonged to the category of working people.

Although the varieties produced and businesses operated by small and medium industrial and commercial business owners were small in scale, they were closely linked and inseparable from people's daily lives. If their activities were lacking, market supply and urban-rural material exchange would be disconnected, and the entire socio-economic life would stagnate. From the perspective of their individual abilities, many people possessed direct business experience in production and operation, and some even possessed certain technical skills. Therefore, from the perspective of their role in building socialism, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners, like large industrial and commercial business owners, could contribute to the country and could be regarded as the country's wealth.

As mentioned above, because small and medium industrial and commercial business owners were economically oppressed and plundered under the capitalist system, and their livelihood mainly relied on their own labor, although they stood at a crossroads, they had no resistance to socialism. After recognizing the laws of social development, in order to control their own destiny, they could only resolutely take the socialist road.

Current Living Conditions of Small and Medium Industrial and Commercial Business Owners

When discussing the living conditions of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners, it is impossible to make a blanket statement. After the high tide of transformation, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners can be roughly divided into three parts, with different living conditions for each.

First, private-side employees in joint ventures who have historically relied on fixed salaries to maintain their livelihoods. Except for a few who reduced their salaries before the joint venture in order to overcome enterprise difficulties and have not been restored, the vast majority have maintained their original salaries without reduction. After wage reforms, there have been varying degrees of increase, and there is generally also a fixed interest income, which, although small, provides some supplementation. At the same time, some welfare benefits of the enterprise can solve some difficulties, so the lives of this group of people are relatively normal.

Second, some small business owners have been absorbed into joint ventures or cooperative organizations. They used to have no distinction between home and business, with no fixed salary expenses. Now, only one person is absorbed to participate in enterprise work and receive a fixed salary. This has caused a significant change in their family economic life. Generally, they reflect that the fixed salary is too low, the family labor force has not received due arrangements, and they cannot find other ways to make a living. Some also have increased living expenses due to the separation of home and business, and their income is not enough to cover their expenses. Therefore, the lives of this group of people are relatively difficult, and some even have serious difficulties.

Third, small vendors. After the high tide of transformation, this group of people once faced great difficulties in life due to the lack of business. Since the government made arrangements in terms of supply of goods, loans, and taxation, their business has generally greatly improved. After the opening of the free market, some businesses have become more active. Therefore, the lives of this group of people are stable, and some have even improved.

In terms of numbers, the third group mentioned above is the largest, followed by the first group, and the second group is relatively small. Therefore, while it is true that some small and medium business owners face serious living difficulties in terms of severity, they are still a minority in terms of quantity. Overall, compared to the old society, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners all realize that the biggest benefit is that they can now control their own destiny and no longer fear being eaten by "big fish" or "small fish." Although some still have difficulties in life, they can move forward steadily, and the future will be better year by year. It is wrong to fail to see the living difficulties of some small and medium households and ignore their suffering; however, it is also inappropriate to exaggerate their difficulties.

The reasons for the difficulties of households mainly arise from the following two aspects:

Regarding family aspects: The vast majority of households in difficulty have large families. With a general level of wage income, other families can manage, but they cannot. Some are also more difficult because the main breadwinner of the family is sick or dead.

Regarding the transformation: Some households in difficulty are some of the small business owners mentioned above who were absorbed into joint ventures or cooperative organizations during the high tide of transformation, with low fixed salary income and no arrangements for family members, so they cannot maintain their family expenses. Some are also private-side employees in joint ventures mentioned above who had their wages reduced in the past and have not yet been restored to a level that can maintain their lives. In the past, some savings could temporarily compensate, but after a long time, the savings are depleted, and they cannot support themselves. Some small vendors in difficulty are caused by the inadequate care of the competent departments in the supply of goods and the failure of bank loans to proceed from actual needs.

In addition, small and medium private individuals in joint ventures can usually get by, but they are afraid of getting sick. When they are sick, they have to receive medical treatment and have their wages deducted, so their demands for medical treatment and sick leave wages are very urgent.

What are the demands of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners? How to solve them?

The general requirement of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners is for everyone to be placed in a suitable position. Separately speaking, there are three things:

First, the requirement to remove the label: The fixed income of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners is generally very small, and their main source of livelihood is labor income. Many people urgently demand to give up fixed interest, remove the label of the bourgeoisie, so as to join the trade union as soon as possible and strive for the due treatment in politics and economy.

Second, the requirement for everyone to have something to do: Small and medium industrial and commercial business owners rely on labor for a living. After the high tide of transformation, society has become a single socialist economy, not as easy as in the past to freely find a way to make a living. In order to solve the difficulties in life, they and their family members urgently demand that everyone has something to do, can do their best and be paid according to their work. In terms of wages and welfare benefits, they demand that they can be gradually improved with the development of production. This is what they demand of socialism.

Third, the requirement to be able to represent their legitimate interests: Small and medium industrial and commercial business owners are the most numerous and have many problems, but their situation and existing problems are often overlooked and not reflected in time. Therefore, they urgently demand that they can represent their legitimate interests and reflect their opinions.

How to solve the problems of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners?

First, on the government side: First of all, it is necessary to consider accepting the demands of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners to voluntarily give up fixed interest and remove their bourgeoisie label. Give them the due treatment in politics and economy, and give full play to their active role to serve socialism. Secondly, it is necessary to continue to earnestly implement the transformation policy and effectively solve their four major demands. Those who have not yet been transformed or have not been arranged to work should continue to be transformed and arranged. The transformation form should be suitable for their realistic living conditions.

Second, on the part of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners themselves: The only future for small and medium industrial and commercial business owners is to organize and take the socialist road. Some people suggest that they be allowed to operate freely to expand employment and reduce their difficulties. I think that the result of doing so would be the free competition of capitalism, and those with small funds and weak labor would be eliminated. Although the difficulties of some people may be solved, the difficulties of another group of people will inevitably increase. That road cannot be taken. The forms of organization for small and medium industrial and commercial business owners can be joint ventures or cooperative organizations according to needs and the principle of voluntary participation. The form of cooperative organization should also be diverse according to the situation of each region and industry, from low to high, without forcing uniformity. There have been many creations in the form of cooperative organizations in various places that can be summarized, introduced, and promoted. Those small business owners who have already entered joint ventures and still have difficulties should not withdraw from the joint ventures. They can only find ways to solve the problems from the joint ventures according to the actual situation, such as adjusting the minimum wage or absorbing family members to participate in labor. Cooperative organizations must also establish various systems such as interest calculation on shares, labor wage scoring, profit distribution, production and operation (including family sideline) plans, and democratic management systems in order to consolidate the organization. After being organized, it is also necessary to give play to the role of mutual learning and mutual assistance, carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen self-education and self-transformation, and make common progress.

Third, on the side of the Federation of Industry and Commerce: First of all, it is necessary to pay attention to the problems of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners, deeply understand their situation, and care about their lives and progress. Strengthen their publicity and guidance work. Help them organize, establish various systems, and improve business management, carry out increasing production and practicing economy, and expand ways of life. Help them organize study. For their households in difficulty, the Industrial and Commercial Life Mutual Aid Fund should give appropriate subsidies. It is necessary to earnestly represent their legitimate interests, reflect their opinions and demands, so that problems can be solved in time. It is also necessary to cultivate backbone forces among them and absorb them to participate in leadership institutions. In the past, some large and medium cities managed the organization of vendors very little. In the future, they should strengthen leadership and strengthen work.

### 怎样解决中小工商业者的困难？

　　怎样解决中小工商业者的困难？
　　湖南省工商联主任委员  向德
    中小工商业者的人数占全国工商界人数90％以上。他们在社会上所处的地位怎样？生活情况怎样？有什么要求？如何解决？应当予以充分重视。我谈谈个人对以上这些问题的意见。
    中小工商业者在社会上所处的地位
    在旧社会资本主义制度下，一切是自由竞争，人各为己。资本家不仅残酷地剥削了工人，对本阶级的人也是互相争夺，不惜你死我活。在“大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米”的社会中，中小工商业者就是竞争的牺牲品，绝大多数是“虾米”，少数幸运一点的也只是“小鱼”。他们每天都是在破产的边缘上挣扎，今天不知道明天的命运如何？因此在旧社会中，从社会经济地位上讲，中小工商业者是一个被统治被压迫被掠夺的阶层。
    中小工商业者许多人由于资本小，占有生产资料很少，自己都要直接从事企业劳动才能维持生活，许多人的家属也是直接参加企业劳动的，有些人投资在合伙的企业成为资方从业人员也主要是借着入股取得一个工作岗位。因此从社会阶级成份上讲这些中小工商业者是属于劳动人民的范畴。
    中小工商业者所生产的品种和经营的业务虽然规模很小，但都是与人民日常生活密切不可分离的。如果缺少他们的活动，市场供应和城乡物资交流就会脱节，整个社会经济生活就会停滞。从他们个人能力来讲，许多人都具有直接生产经营的业务经验，有些人还具有一定的技术水平。因此从对建设社会主义的作用来讲，中小工商业者同大工商业者一样都可为国家作出贡献，都可视为国家的财富。
    如上所述中小工商业者由于在资本主义制度下在经济上受着压迫和掠夺，生活来源主要是依靠自己的劳动力，因此，他们虽然是站在十字路口，但对社会主义是没有抵触的。他们在认识社会发展规律以后为着掌握自己的命运，只有坚决走社会主义的道路。
    目前中小工商业者的生活情况
    谈中小工商业者的生活情况不可笼统地说如何如何。在改造高潮以后中小工商业者大体可分为三部分，生活情况各有不同。
    一、在合营企业的私方从业人员历来靠固定工薪收入维持生活的，这部分人除少数在合营前为着克服企业困难降低了薪水没有恢复外，绝大部分都维持了原薪没有减少，经过工资改革后还有或多或少的提高，一般还有定息收入，虽然为数不多，但也不无少补。同时企业有些福利照顾可以解决一些困难，因此这部分人的生活是比较正常的。
    二、有些小业主被吸收到了合营企业或合作组织内，他们原来是家店不分，没有固定开支的工薪数目，现在只吸收他们一个人参加企业工作，拿固定工薪，这部分人对他们的家庭经济生活来讲是发生了一个很大的变动。一般都反映固定工资低了，家属劳动力没有得到应有的安排，找不到别的生活门路。还有些因家店分开生活费用增加了，收入不敷支出。因此这部分人的生活是比较困难的，有的困难程度还颇严重。
    三、小商小贩，这部分人在改造高潮后一度因没有业务做了，生活发生很大的困难，自政府就货源、贷款、税收三方面作了安排以后，一般业务都已大为好转。在自由市场开放以后有些业务更为活跃。因此这部分人的生活是安定的，有些还有所提高。
    从人数上讲，以上述第三部分的人最多，第一部分的人数次之，第二部分的人是比较少的。因此说中小工商业者生活困难从程度上讲确有比较严重的，从数量上讲则还是少数。总的讲，如果拿来和旧社会比较，中小工商业者都体会到有一条最大的好处就是现在能够掌握自己的命运了，再不怕有“大鱼”或“小鱼”来吃了。目前生活虽然有些还有困难，但可以安安稳稳地前进，前途是会一年比一年好的。看不到某些中小户的生活困难，漠视他们的疾苦，固然不对；但是如果夸大他们的困难，也是不应该的。
    困难户的原因主要是从以下两个方面产生的
    属于家庭方面的：困难户绝大多数是家庭人口多了，靠一般水平的工资收入，别家能维持，他们就不能维持。还有些是因为家庭的主要劳动力病了或死了，就更难维持。
    属于改造方面的：有些困难户即上述一些小业主在改造高潮时被吸收到了合营或合作组织，固定工薪收入少，家属又未得到安排，因此不能维持家庭开支。有些也是上面讲过的合营企业的私方从业人员过去降低了工资尚未恢复到能够维持生活的水平，过去有些积蓄可以一时抵补，久之积蓄空了，就无法支持。有些小商小贩的困难户是由于归口部门对货源供应照顾不够，银行贷款未从实际需要出发所造成的。
    此外在合营企业中的中小私方人员在平常还可过得去，就是怕病。病了既要医疗又要扣工资，因此发生困难。所以他们对医疗待遇和病假工资的要求是十分迫切的。
    中小工商业者有些什么要求？如何解决？
    中小工商业者总的要求是要各得其所，分开来讲有三件事：
    一、要求摘帽子：中小工商业者一般定息收入很少，主要生活来源是劳动收入。许多人迫切要求放弃定息，摘去资产阶级的帽子，以便早日加入工会，争取在政治上和经济上应有的待遇。
    二、要求人人有事做：中小工商业者是靠劳动为生，在改造高潮以后社会已成为单一的社会主义经济了，不是和过去一样容易自由找到生活门路。为着解决生活困难，他们和他们的家属都迫切要求人人有事做，能各尽所能按劳取酬，在
  工资和福利待遇方面要求随着生产的发展能逐步提高。这就是他们所要求的社会主义。
    三、要求能代表他们的合法利益：中小工商业者人数最多，问题不少，但他们的情况和存在问题，往往被人忽视，没有及时反映出来。因此他们迫切要求要能代表他们的合法利益和反映他们的意见。
    如何解决中小工商业者的问题？
    一、政府方面：首先要考虑接受中小工商业者自愿放弃定息的要求，把他们的资产阶级帽子摘去。在政治上和经济上给他们以应有的待遇，充分利用和发挥他们的积极作用以为社会主义服务。其次要继续认真贯彻改造政策，切实解决他们四大要求。有些尚未归口改造或未安排工作的要继续归口改造和安排，改造形式要能适合他们现实的生活条件。
    二、中小工商业者本身方面：中小工商业者唯一的前途是组织起来走社会主义的道路。有人建议让他们自由经营，扩大就业面以减少他们的困难。我认为那样做的结果就是资本主义的自由竞争，资金小的和劳动力弱的就会被淘汰下来。一部分人的困难虽然可能会得到解决，但必然会有另一部分人的困难将要增加。那条路是走不得的。中小工商业者组织起来的形式可以根据需要，可能与自愿的原则或为合营或为合作组织。合作组织的形式也应当根据各地各业的情况，采取多种多样的方式，由低到高，不必强求一律。各地对合作组织的形式已有不少的创造可总结介绍推广。凡小业主已经走入合营目前还有困难的，也不宜退出合营，仍然只有从合营企业根据实际情况想些办法，如调整最低限度的工资或吸收家属参加劳动等来解决。合作组织还必须订立各种制度如股金计息，劳动工资计分，盈余分配，生产经营（包括家庭副业）计划，及民主管理等制度，都要逐步建立和健全起来，才能使组织巩固。又组织起来后还要发挥相互学习相互帮助的作用，开展批评和自我批评加强自我教育自我改造共同进步。
    三、工商联方面：首先要对中小工商业者的问题重视起来，深入了解他们的情况，关心他们的生活和进步。加强对他们的宣教和辅导工作。帮助他们组织起来，建立各种制度和改善经营管理，开展增产节约，扩大生活门路。帮助他们组织学习。对他们的困难户要由工商界生活互助金给以适当的补助。要认真代表他们的合法利益，反映他们的意见和要求，使问题能及时地得到解决。还要在他们中间培养骨干力量，吸收他们参加领导机构。若干大中城市过去对摊贩组织管得很少，今后应加强领导加强工作。
