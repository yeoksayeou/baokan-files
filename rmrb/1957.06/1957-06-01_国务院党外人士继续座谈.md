Xinhua News Agency, 30th: State Council Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun continued to invite non-Party members to a forum this afternoon.

State Council Counselor Li Zuyin was the first to speak this afternoon. He believes that the Counselor's Office has not received the attention it deserves from the State Council, and therefore has not played its due role. He also criticized the sectarianism and bureaucracy of the former leadership of the Legislative Affairs Commission.

Li Zuyin criticized many wasteful phenomena. He pointed out that construction sites of the Ministry of Commerce were full of bricks, tiles, and other materials, which were wasted without anyone caring. He also criticized the wastefulness of senior cadres using cars.

Li Zuyin agreed with family planning, but he criticized some contraceptive methods that were widely promoted and introduced without scientific verification, leading to malpractices. He believes that artificial abortion does more harm than good, and that contraceptive illustrations posted in pharmacies and public places will corrupt social morality.

State Council Counselor Chen Xiuhe suggested that united front work must pay attention to uniting technical personnel. He suggested that proper arrangements should be made for some old military technical personnel.

Chen Xiuhe accused the Written Language Reform Committee of being monopolized by a few people. They sent out tens of thousands of draft plans for language reform to solicit opinions, but they did not accept the opinions of others. He believes that this cannot be entirely blamed on the Written Language Reform Committee, the responsibility lies with the State Council. He said that language reform is a major matter, why did the State Council hastily approve and publish the reform plan? He believes that the school system and textbooks in primary and secondary schools are a big problem, involving many people, and he hopes that the State Council will conduct practical inspections and make improvements.

Speaking of the arrangement of engineering and technical personnel, Chen Xiuhe pointed out that the Dalian Shipyard, with more than 10,000 people, does not have a design engineer, and the automobile factory with 7,000 to 8,000 people also lacks engineering and technical personnel. In Xinjiang, he met a chief engineer, but this chief engineer had never studied engineering and technology, but was transferred from another field. Due to the lack of technical personnel, the waste caused by improper design is very serious. But conversely, many engineering and technical personnel are idle and have nothing to do. He said that the Beijing Institute of Technology lacks professors of military engineering, but a scholar who studied military engineering in France was assigned to Wuhan University to teach other courses.

State Council Counselor Zhang Youjiang put forward four suggestions in his speech. First, abolish the eight offices under the State Council. He believes that doing so can not only reduce levels and strengthen the leadership of various ministries, but also further promote the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of various ministries. Second, he suggested establishing several committees under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to contact the various departments of the State Council and strengthen supervision of the government's work. Third, he suggested that the Ministry of Supervision under the State Council should be transferred to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He believes that the main task of the national supervisory agency is to supervise the work of the staff of the state organs. Placing such an institution under the State Council is inappropriate and cannot play its due role. Fourth, he suggested implementing a seniority wage system for service personnel so that the lives of these personnel can be improved year by year, work hard, and further promote their enthusiasm.

State Council Counselor Wang Zhuoran, who is in charge of the national science popularization inspection, said that although there are more than 210,000 science popularization members nationwide, only 40,000 to 50,000 are regularly working. He believes that the main problem in science popularization work nationwide is that the leadership of the Party and government lags behind the actual needs.

Wang Zhuoran suggested that the central government should "strengthen leadership and comprehensively plan" for science popularization work. He advocated incorporating science popularization work into the work of the Science Planning Commission of the State Council.

Wang Zhuoran suggested that local authorities should adopt the policy of "overall planning and appropriate arrangements" for science popularization work.

    国务院党外人士继续座谈
    据新华社30日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋在今天下午继续邀请党外人士举行座谈会。
    国务院参事李祖荫今天下午首先发言。他认为参事室没有受到国务院应有的重视，因而没有发挥它应有的作用。他还批评了前法制委员会领导上的宗派主义和官僚主义。
    李祖荫批评了许多浪费现象。他指出商业部建筑工地上满地是砖瓦和其他材料，任凭浪费无人过问。他还批评高级干部坐小汽车的浪费现象。
    李祖荫同意节育，但他对有些避孕方法没有经过科学证实就广为宣传介绍以致发生流弊提出了批评。他认为人工流产害多利少，并认为药店和公共场所张贴避孕图解会败坏社会道德风尚。
    国务院参事陈修和提出，统战工作必须注意团结技术人员。他建议对一些旧的军事技术人员应该进行妥善地安排。
    陈修和指责文字改革委员会被少数人包办了，他们发出几万份改革文字的方案征求意见，但别人提出了意见他们不接受。他认为这不能完全怪文字改革委员会，责任在国务院。他说，文字改革是一件大事情，为什么国务院就把改革方案草率地批准公布了？他认为中小学的学制和课本是一个很大的问题，牵涉到很多人，希望国务院进行切实检查作出改进的办法。
    谈到工程技术人员的安排问题，陈修和指出，大连一万多人的造船厂没有一个能设计的工程师，七八千人的汽车厂也缺少工程技术人员。在新疆，他曾遇到一个总工程师，但这个总工程师根本没有学过工程技术，而是转业来的。由于缺乏技术人员，设计不当造成的浪费现象非常严重。但相反地却有许多工程技术人员闲着没有事情干。他说，北京工业学院缺少兵工教授，但有一个曾在法国学过兵工工程的学者却被分配到武汉大学去教别的课程。
    国务院参事章友江在发言中提出了四点建议。第一，取消国务院所属的八个办公室。他认为这样做不但可以减少层次，增强各个部的领导力量，同时也可以进一步发挥各个部的积极性和责任感。第二，他建议在全国人民代表大会常务委员会下面设立几个委员会，同国务院各个业务部门联系，加强监督政府的工作。第三，他建议把国务院所属的监察部改属全国人民代表大会常务委员会。他认为，国家监察机关的主要任务是监察国家机关工作人员的工作，把这样一个机构放在国务院是不适宜的，是不能发挥它的应有作用的。第四，他建议对勤杂人员实行年资工资制，这样可以使这些人员的生活逐年改善，努力工作，进一步发挥积极性。
    负责全国科学普及检查工作的国务院参事王卓然说，目前全国虽有二十一万多科普会员，但经常有工作的不过四、五万人。他认为在全国范围内科普工作存在的主要问题，是党政的领导落后于实际的需要。
    王卓然建议，在中央方面对科普工作要“加强领导，全面规划”。他主张把科普工作列为国务院科学规划委员会的工作内。
    王卓然建议地方对科普工作应以“统筹兼顾，适当安排”作为方针。
