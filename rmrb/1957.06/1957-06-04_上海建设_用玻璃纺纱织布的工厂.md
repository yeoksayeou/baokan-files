Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 3rd. A new factory, the likes of which China has never seen before – a factory for spinning and weaving glass yarn – is about to appear in Shanghai. The founder of this new factory, Cheng Weimin, told Xinhua reporters on the 1st that the factory he is responsible for establishing, which will manufacture high-grade glass fiber cloth, will be a large-scale experimental factory. Forty spinning machines he designed will be installed in this factory, along with a crucible furnace for melting glass and a batch of plying machines, looms, and other equipment. Once construction is completed, this factory can produce more than ten tons of various acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and high-temperature resistant glass yarns, glass cloths, glass ropes, glass tapes, and other products annually for trial use in the aviation, electrical machinery, and other manufacturing industries. At the same time, through experimental production, the process of manufacturing glass fiber cloth will be gradually improved, accumulating technical data for the establishment of a larger glass fiber cloth manufacturing plant.

Currently, the factory construction work is actively underway. A factory building covering several acres of land has been allocated by the East China Textile Industry Bureau to the Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industry Company, which is responsible for preparing for the construction of this new factory. The machines used to manufacture high-grade glass filaments are also being trial-manufactured by the Shanghai No. 1 Machine Tool Manufacturing Company. It is expected that production can begin within the year.

After this factory is completed, what will enter the factory will be raw materials for manufacturing glass, such as sand, and what will leave the factory will be pure white and soft glass yarn, glass cloth, and other products. Because this factory's method of manufacturing high-grade glass filaments does not require expensive platinum crucibles, the equipment cost for each spinning machine is expected to be only a little over 1,000 yuan, making the investment extremely low. It is estimated that all factory construction costs can be recovered within one year, with some left over.

### 上海建设  用玻璃纺纱织布的工厂

    上海建设
    用玻璃纺纱织布的工厂
    新华社上海3日电　一个我国从来没有过的新工厂——用玻璃纺纱织布的工厂，即将在上海出现。这个新厂的创办人程伟民在1日告诉新华社记者说，他负责筹建的制造高级玻璃纱布的工厂，将是一个大型的实验性工厂。在这个工厂里，将要安装四十台他所设计出来的纺丝机，一只熔化玻璃的坩锅窑以及一批拼丝机、织布机等设备。建设完成后，这个厂可以年产十多吨耐酸、耐碱、耐高温的各种玻璃纱、玻璃布、玻璃绳、玻璃带等产品，供航空、电机等制造工业试用。同时，通过实验性的生产，逐渐地改进制造玻璃纱布的工艺过程，为建立更大的玻璃纱布制造厂积累技术资料。
    目前建厂工作正在积极进行。一座面积有好几亩田大小的厂房，已由华东纺织工业管理局拨给负责筹建这个新厂的上海市电讯电器工业公司。制造高级玻璃丝用的机器，也正由上海市第一机床制造公司试造样品。预计年内可以开工生产。
    这个工厂建成后，进厂的将是沙子等制造玻璃的原料，出厂的却是洁白柔软的玻璃纱、玻璃布等产品。由于这个厂制造高级玻璃丝方法不需要贵重的白金坩锅。每台纺丝机的设备费用预计只需一千多元，投资极省。估计在一年之内可以收回全部建厂费用还有余。
