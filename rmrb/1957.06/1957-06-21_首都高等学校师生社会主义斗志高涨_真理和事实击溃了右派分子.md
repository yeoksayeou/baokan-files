Xinhua News Agency, 20th: In the capital's universities, after teachers and students launched a struggle to counter the reactionary statements of rightists, the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightists have collapsed in the face of socialist righteousness. The struggle is currently developing. At present, the vast majority of teachers and students are both drawing clear political and ideological lines and countering reactionary statements. The big-character posters in the schools are filled with short articles refuting the statements of the rightists, and the situation has also changed significantly in the schools' debates and free forums. In the past, a very small number of rightists in the schools had madly attacked the Party, the government, and the socialist system. Although their reactionary statements never received the support of the majority and aroused a lot of indignation and refutation, some of the masses were confused by these statements or felt that although these statements were wrong, they did not need to be refuted. Now, the vast majority of teachers and students have seen the essence of the reactionary statements of the rightists. Many people with a sense of justice have actively participated in the counterattack against the reactionary statements, while the rightists have shrunk to the side. Some dare not show their faces, and some, in the face of irrefutable truth and facts, have been forced to examine themselves and express repentance. Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou, lecturers in the Industrial Economics Department of Renmin University, are now looking for excuses to try to muddle through. Many societies and groups organized in the past under the instigation of some rightists in some schools, or societies and groups openly organized by rightists, have disintegrated one after another. The "Hundred Flowers Society," organized by Tan Tianrong, a student in the Physics Department of Peking University, had previously gone to many schools to instigate students to rise up against the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class. Now, many members of the society have announced their withdrawal from the organization.

Rightists Use the Pretext of "Helping the Rectification Campaign" to Clamor Against Communism and Socialism

Since the beginning of May, the vast majority of teachers and students have put forward many well-intentioned criticisms of the many mistakes and shortcomings in the schools. Most of these criticisms are correct; some opinions, although not entirely correct or completely in line with the facts, have good intentions. At this time, some rightists, under the guise of "helping the Party's rectification campaign," clamored against Communism and socialism. These clamors were coordinated with reactionary statements outside the schools. They used the banner of anti-doctrinism to oppose Marxism-Leninism, saying that "taking Marxism as the guiding ideology will inevitably produce doctrinism, and doctrinism is inseparable from Marxism," and that "Marxism is outdated." They used the banner of opposing sectarianism to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that "the leadership of the Communist Party in all state departments must be abolished," that "the leadership of the Party must be abolished to promote social development," and that "if one party leads, it will inevitably protect the 'three evils.'" They also used the banner of opposing bureaucratism to oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, saying that "a proletarian dictatorship is not a socialist society," that "there is no freedom or democracy now," and that they wanted to launch a "movement to fight for democracy and freedom." They wanted to use the rectification campaign launched by the Party to overthrow the socialist social system, saying that "the root of the 'three isms' lies in the social and political system, and to eradicate the 'three evils,' the socialist system must be changed."

At that time, many teachers and students, in response to the Party's call, focused their attention on making criticisms and suggestions about the Party's leadership work, so they did not consider for a time to distinguish the essence and purpose of the rightists' statements. Some people also temporarily echoed the clamor of the rightists because their ideological stand was not firm. Although many teachers and students immediately expressed opposition to certain blatant reactionary statements, the rightists said that they were "hindering the blooming and contending," hindering people from making suggestions to the Party, and hindering them from helping the Party's rectification campaign, and they tried to stop them. Especially for Party members, the rightists incited some of the masses to launch vicious attacks on them, saying that they refused criticism and were trying to block their counter-criticism. At that time, the Party organizations in the schools did not immediately launch a systematic counterattack against the rightists' statements, in order to allow the masses inside and outside the Party to fully and freely express their criticisms and opinions on the Party's mistakes and shortcomings. At the same time, in this process, they should recognize the anti-socialist face of the rightists, and after independent consideration, distinguish right from wrong, so as to achieve the goal of truly drawing a line ideologically with the rightists' reactionary views. After a period of time, this goal was indeed achieved.

The Broad Masses of Teachers and Students Recognize the Essence of the Rightists' Statements

On June 8, the People's Daily published the editorial "Why Is This?", followed by the editorials "There Should Be Active Criticism, but Also Correct Counter-Criticism," "The Whole Nation Should Unite on the Basis of Socialism," and "Is It a Matter of Standpoint?", which promoted the transformation of the struggle situation in the schools. The majority of teachers and students calmed down, and while criticizing the Party's shortcomings, they also turned to consider the purpose and essence of the rightists' statements. From the 13th to the 15th, the Party committee leaders of twenty-one universities made rectification inspection reports, accepted the correct criticisms made by the majority of teachers and students on the errors in the school's leadership work, and began to improve their work based on these opinions. At the same time, it was pointed out that the reactionary statements of the rightists must be discussed and counterattacked. The majority of teachers and students in the schools saw the determination and sincerity of the leaders to rectify the situation. They also linked the reactionary statements of the rightists in the schools with some reactionary statements in society, and gradually realized the fact that the rightists were using the rectification movement to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. They discovered that some people were indeed trying to subvert the leadership of the working class, wanted to turn back the clock, and wanted to drag New China back onto the capitalist road. Li Siwen, a teacher at Beijing Normal University, said: Today's struggle by the rightists against us is to compete for leadership. It is very dangerous if we do not fight against this kind of action. Many teachers and students, especially after seeing the truth about the words and deeds of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping, as revealed by Shi Liang and others, have become more vigilant.

Some people who were once deeply confused by the statements of the rightists have now also joined the struggle to counter the statements of the rightists. Hong Youzhong, a student at Renmin University, used to be an office worker and had followed Cheng Haiguo (also known as Lin Xiling), a rightist student in the Law Department. After many students refuted Cheng Haiguo's reactionary statements, Hong Youzhong said: "I drank a cup of colorless poison! I successfully experienced the land reform struggle in the past, but now in the socialist struggle, I almost went down the wrong path." In the debate refuting the statements of the rightists, he exposed the rightists' conspiracy to fabricate facts and incite young students to be dissatisfied with the Party and the state.

The Rightists' So-Called "Facts" Are All Deliberately Exaggerated and Fabricated

Since the 16th, the majority of teachers and students in the various schools have turned to the struggle to counter the statements of the rightists. They first analyzed the "facts" put forward by the rightists that "the Communist Party can no longer guarantee the progress of our country" through investigation and research, and found that these "facts" were either deliberately exaggerating individual shortcomings in the work or were completely fabricated. Cheng Haiguo, a student in the Law Department of Renmin University, believed that today's social system must be thoroughly reformed, but more than 40 pieces of material cited by this person have now been exposed by the students one by one. Except for a few that have already been published in the newspapers, the rest were fabricated by her. The teachers and students used their own personal experiences to refute the reactionary statement that "without the Communist Party, people would not betray the country." Yang Xuetong, professor and expert on the cost of living at Renmin University, pointed out that in the old China before liberation, which was not led by the Communist Party, the authorities constantly engaged in traitorous activities. From 1840 to 1935, they signed 267 treaties of humiliation with the imperialists. More than 100 university students from worker backgrounds at Renmin University compared their inhuman lives before liberation with the fact that they can now attend university for free, and refuted the reactionary statements. Some teachers, citing the great achievements made by the Communist Party in leading the people of the whole country to complete land reform, complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts, and lead the people of the whole country in industrial and agricultural production after liberation, refuted the fallacy of the rightists that "the leadership of the Party must be abolished to promote social development." In the past, the rightists tried hard to make people believe that "the root of the 'three isms' lies in the social and political system." A teacher at Beijing Normal University refuted this conspiracy, saying, why not ask in reverse: who is leading the movement to oppose bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism? In fact, it is the Communist Party that is opposing these poisons. Historically, no ruling party or ruling class has ever put forward such a proposition. This proves that the root of these poisons does not lie in the Communist Party and the social and political system it leads. He also said that if we were to abandon the leadership of the Communist Party, many historical facts prove that the "three isms" would only become more serious. The "three isms" that exist now are fewer than in any era in history, and their nature is completely different. The Rightists Are At A Loss For Words And Run Into Walls Everywhere

Now, the rightists are running into walls everywhere in the schools and have lost the arrogance they had a few days ago. Cheng Haiguo, a student in the Law Department of Renmin University, had made several anti-socialist speeches on and off campus in the past. The students of Renmin University held five debates and refuted her arguments one by one. Cheng Haiguo felt that she was at a loss for words and has not dared to attend the last two debates, saying to people: "Let me shut myself up and think about it!" The reactionary clique at Peking University, the so-called "Hundred Flowers Society," had compiled and printed a publication in the name of "Peking University's Democratic Relay Baton." In this publication, they falsely claimed that Peking University had been "ruled by counter-revolutionaries" and that "the situation was worse than the Polish and Hungarian events." They sent these publications to universities and colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. Now, these publications and secret letters have been returned with sternly critical replies. They handed over their compiled publication, "Plaza," to the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory for typesetting. The printing workers discovered that the content of this publication was all against the Communist Party and against socialism. The workers were extremely angry and refused to typeset it for them. After this incident occurred, they attempted to "accuse" the workers on campus. When they went to the school's broadcasting room to borrow a loudspeaker, the workers in the broadcasting room refused to lend it to them because they opposed their unreasonable "accusation" of the workers, and Tan Tianrong then hit the worker. Many big-character posters posted by students at Peking University these days have accused them of their illegal acts.

On the 18th, Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was broadcast, which made the struggle to counter the statements of the rightists in the schools more powerful and in-depth. The teachers and students of the Aviation Institute passed a public letter to various newspapers at a general meeting of all personnel held on this day. The letter stated: We love socialism. Whoever hates our happy life, whoever slanders and defames our Party, is our irreconcilable enemy. We are determined to be united forever around the Party. We will never withdraw our troops until the rightists are completely defeated and the counter-revolutionaries are completely eliminated.

### 首都高等学校师生社会主义斗志高涨  真理和事实击溃了右派分子

　　首都高等学校师生社会主义斗志高涨
    真理和事实击溃了右派分子
    新华社20日讯　在首都各高等学校中，教师、学生发动了反击右派分子反动言论的斗争以后，反共、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，在社会主义正气面前已纷纷溃退，目前斗争正在发展中。现在，绝大多数的教师和学生都在一面划清政治思想界限，一面反击反动的言论。各校的大字报上到处是批驳右派言论的短文，在各校的辩论会和自由讲坛上，情况也有了明显的改变。过去学校中极少数右派分子曾经向党、政府和社会主义制度进行猖狂的攻击，他们的反动言论虽然从来得不到大多数人的支持，并且引起了很多人的愤慨和驳斥，但是还有一部分群众为这种言论所迷惑，或者认为这种言论虽然错误，但是可以不去反驳。现在是绝大多数的教师和学生已经看清楚了右派分子反动言论的实质，很多有正义感的人都积极参加了对反动言论的反击，而右派分子则缩在一旁，有的不敢露面了，有的在无可辩驳的真理和事实面前，被迫检讨，表示悔改了。人民大学工业经济系的讲师葛佩琦、王德周现在正在寻找遁词，企图蒙混过去。不少学校过去在部分右派分子煽动下组织起来的社、团、或右派分子公开出面组织的社、团已经纷纷瓦解。北京大学以物理系学生谭天荣为首组织的“百花学社”，过去曾到许多学校煽动学生起来反对工人阶级领导的人民民主专政，现在社里的许多社员已宣布脱离这个组织。
　　右派借“帮助整风”为幌子叫嚣反共反社会主义
    从5月初以来，绝大多数教师和学生对学校存在的不少错误和缺点，提出了许多善意的批评，这些批评绝大多数是正确的；也有些意见虽然不够正确，不完全符合事实，但是动机是好的。在这个时候，有一些右派分子在“帮助党整风”的幌子之下进行了反共反社会主义的叫嚣。这些叫嚣是和校外的反动言论相配合的。他们打着反教条主义的幌子来反对马列主义，说“以马克思主义作为指导思想必然产生教条主义，教条主义和马克思主义不可分”，“马克思主义已经过时”。他们打着反对宗派主义的幌子来反对共产党领导，说是要“取消共产党在一切国家部门的领导”，“必须取消党的领导才能促进社会发展”，“如果一个党领导，必然会保护三害”，他们还打着反对官僚主义的幌子来反对人民民主专政，说“无产阶级专政的国家就不是社会主义社会”，“现在没有自由，没有民主”，要发动“争民主争自由的运动”。他们想利用党所发动的整风运动来推翻社会主义社会制度，说“三个主义的根源是社会政治制度产生的，要铲除‘三害’就要改变社会主义制度。”
    当时不少的教师和学生，因为响应党的号召，注意力集中在对党的领导工作提出批评和建议，所以一时没有考虑到去辨别右派分子言论的实质和目的。也有一部分人由于自己的思想立场不坚定而暂时地附和了右派分子的叫嚣。虽然对于某些露骨的反动言论，立即有很多教师和学生表示反对，但是他们一发言，右派分子就说他们“阻碍鸣放”，阻碍对党提意见，阻碍他们帮助党整风，加以阻止。特别是对于党员，右派分子煽动了部分群众，向他们进行恶毒的攻击，说他们拒绝批评，企图堵住他们的反批评。当时学校中的党组织没有立即对右派分子的言论发动有系统的反击，是为了让党内外群众都能够充分地畅所欲言地对党的错误、缺点提出批评和意见，同时在这种过程中认识右派分子反社会主义的面貌，并且经过独立的考虑，辨明是非，以便达到在思想上和右派分子的反动观点真正划清界限的目的。经过一段时间以后，这种目的果然达到了。
　　广大师生认清了右派言论的实质
    6月8日，人民日报发表了“这是为什么？”的社论，接着又发表了“要有积极的批评，也要有正确的反批评”“全国人民在社会主义基础上团结起来”“是不是立场问题？”等社论，促进了各校的斗争形势的转变。大多数教师和学生们头脑冷静下来了，他们在批评党的缺点同时，也转过来考虑右派分子言论的目的和实质了。13日到15日二十一个高等学校的党委负责人作了整风检查报告，接受了大多数教师和学生对学校领导工作上的错误所作的正确批评，并且根据这些意见开始改进工作。同时，指出对右派分子的反动言论，必须展开讨论和反击。各校的大多数教师和学生看到了领导者整风的决心和诚意。他们又把校内的右派分子反动言论和社会上的一些反动言论联系起来看，逐渐地认识到右派分子利用整风运动向党进行猖狂进攻的事实，发现的确有人在颠复工人阶级的领导，想开倒车，要把新中国拉回到资本主义的道路上去。北京师范大学教员李思温说：今天右派对我们的斗争是为了争夺领导，我们不对这种行动进行斗争，是很危险的。许多教师和学生特别是在看到了史良等人所揭露的章伯钧和储安平等人言行的真相以后，革命警惕性更加提高了。
    有些一度被右派分子的言论迷惑得较深的人，现在也投入了反击右派言论的斗争。人民大学的学生洪有仲过去是机关工作人员，曾跟着右派分子法律系学生程海果（即林希翎）走。在许多学生驳倒了程海果的反动言论后，洪有仲说：“我喝了一杯无色的毒水！过去土地改革斗争我胜利地经历过来了，而现在进行社会主义斗争，我几乎走错了路。”他在反驳右派分子言论的辩论会上，揭发了右派分子捏造事实、煽动青年学生对党对国家不满的阴谋。
　　右派的所谓“事实”全是故意夸大和捏造
    从16日以来，各个学校里的大多数教师和学生已纷纷转入反击右派分子言论的斗争。他们首先经过调查研究而分析了右派所提出的
  “共产党已经不能保证我们国家进步”的“事实”，发现这些“事实”不是故意夸大工作中的个别的缺点，就是完全捏造出来的。人民大学法律系学生程海果，认为今天的社会制度非彻底改革不可，可是这个人所引用的四十多件材料，现在已被学生们一件一件的揭穿了，其中除了几件是报纸上早已登过的外，其余的都是她自己捏造的。教师们和学生们引用了自己的亲身经历驳斥了“没有共产党，人家也不会卖国”的反动言论。人民大学教授、生活指数专家杨学通指出，在解放以前的不是由共产党领导的旧中国，当权者不断地进行卖国活动，他们从1840年到1935年，和帝国主义订立了二百六十七个丧权辱国的条约。人民大学一百多个工人出身的大学生以自己在解放前所过的非人生活和今天能够免费上大学的事实作对比，对反动言论进行了驳斥。有的教师引用解放后共产党领导全国人民完成土地改革、完成对资本主义工商业、农业、手工业的社会主义改造，以及领导全国人民在工业、农业生产方面获得的伟大成就，驳斥了右派分子所谓“必须取消党的领导才能促进社会发展”的谬论。过去，右派分子努力想使人相信“三大主义的根源在社会政治制度”。北京师范大学的一位教师驳斥了这种阴谋，他说，为什么不反过来追问一下：谁在领导反对官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的运动呢？实际上反对这些毒害的是共产党，历史上没有任何一个执政的政党，一个执政的阶级提出过这样的主张，这证明这些毒害的根源不在于共产党和它所领导的社会政治制度。他又说，如果要离开共产党的领导，历史的许多事实证明，“三大主义”只有更加严重，现在所存在的“三大主义”比历史上任何一个时代都要少，而且性质迥然不同。右派分子理屈词穷到处碰壁
    现在右派分子在各学校里到处碰壁，已经丧失了前些日子的狂妄的气焰。人民大学法律系学生程海果，过去曾在校内外发表了几次反社会主义的言论，人民大学的学生举行了五次辩论会，把她的论点逐个的驳倒，程海果已感到理屈词穷，最近两次辩论会都不敢出席，对人说：“让我关起门来考虑考虑吧！”北京大学的反动小集团所谓“百花学社”，曾以“北大民主接力棒”为名编印了刊物，在这个刊物里造谣说北大已被“反革命统治了”，“闹得比波匈事件还凶”，他们把这些刊物寄给北京、上海、天津等地的高等学校，现在这些刊物和秘密信都附有严厉指责的回信而被退回来了。他们把所编刊物——“广场”交给北京印刷一厂排印，印刷工人们发现这个刊物的内容都是反对共产党、反对社会主义的言论，工人们极为气愤，拒绝给他们排印。这件事发生后，他们企图在校内“控诉”工人，当他们要去学校播音室借扩音器时，播音室的工人因为反对他们对工人的无理“控诉”而拒绝借给他们，谭天荣又动手打了这个工人。北大的学生们这几天贴出的许多大字报上，纷纷指责他们的不法行为。
    18日，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告广播了，这使各个学校反击右派言论的斗争更有力更深入地开展起来。航空学院的师生在这天举行的全体人员大会上通过了一封致各报社的公开信，信中说道：我们热爱社会主义，谁对我们的幸福生活表示憎恨，谁对我们党进行污蔑诽谤，谁就是我们不共戴天的仇敌。我们坚决地永远团结在党的周围，不把右派分子完全击溃，不把反革命分子完全肃清，我们决不收兵。
