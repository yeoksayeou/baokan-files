Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Washington: The U.S. Department of Defense today publicly announced that the United States is abandoning its obligations under paragraph D of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and has decided to openly transport new weapons into South Korea. The U.S. government has ordered the U.S. Chief Commissioner to the Korean Military Armistice Commission to present the demand for the unilateral abolition of this key clause of the Armistice Agreement at a meeting in Panmunjom this afternoon.

This American action destroys the integrity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and seriously threatens the Korean armistice and peace in the Far East. However, the U.S. Department of Defense, in its statement issued today, actually described its actions as for "defense" and stated its intention to conditionally abide by the ceasefire provisions and other clauses of the Armistice Agreement.

The statement issued by the U.S. Department of Defense fabricates the lie that the Korean and Chinese sides have violated the Armistice Agreement by importing reinforcements, in order to justify the U.S.'s unilateral abolition of paragraph D of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, which prohibits the import of reinforcement weapons. The United States also used the same tactic last year when it unilaterally prohibited the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from conducting inspections at ports in South Korea.

The U.S. is now offering another excuse for its violation of the Armistice Agreement: the equipment and weapons of the troops in South Korea have become obsolete and outdated, and cannot be replaced with existing or currently produced equipment and weapons. Therefore, it wants to unilaterally amend the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement in order to "maintain a relative balance of military strength."

Officials from the U.S. Department of Defense revealed that the U.S. had long disregarded the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and "begun" to modernize the U.S. forces in South Korea, and that "a certain degree of modernization" of the Syngman Rhee army was also being "considered under the military aid program, including equipment such as aircraft, communications equipment, and automatic materials."

U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Snyder said that "new jet combat aircraft will begin to be shipped to South Korea immediately," and that these aircraft are "clearly capable of launching atomic weapons."

When a reporter asked Snyder whether the ten countries with troops in South Korea fully agreed with the U.S. decision, he did not answer the question directly, saying only that these countries had been given "every opportunity" to express their opinions, and he did not think anyone had expressed any objection. He said that these countries had been discussing it for "quite a long time."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 21st: Seoul dispatch: Commander of the Far East U.S. Forces, the so-called "United Nations Commander" Lemnitzer, flew from Tokyo to Seoul this afternoon to discuss the issue of transporting new weapons into South Korea with Syngman Rhee.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 21st: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong dispatch: Major General Zheng Guolu, Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, today severely condemned the U.S. side's crude attempt to violate the Armistice Agreement and lodged the strongest protest at the commission meeting.

Today's meeting was held at the suggestion of the U.S. side. U.S. Chief Commissioner Homer Leezenberg stated at the meeting that the U.S. believes "it has the right to terminate the obligations it has correspondingly assumed under the provisions of this clause (Article 13 of the second chapter of the Korean Armistice Agreement)" and to replace "old weapons with new weapons."

Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out at the meeting that the U.S. is unwilling to resolve the Korean issue peacefully, expressed its lack of respect for the Armistice Agreement at the time it was signed, and has continued to violate and undermine important clauses of the Armistice Agreement since the armistice.

The U.S. should abide by the Armistice Agreement, but now it is once again attempting to violate the Armistice Agreement to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. should withdraw its troops from Korea, but now it is attempting to bring new weapons into South Korea, to perpetuate the U.S. occupation of South Korea, and to intimidate and suppress the South Korean people who oppose the U.S. occupiers and the Syngman Rhee clique. The U.S. is also attempting to violate the Armistice Agreement, turning South Korea into a U.S. atomic war base, aggravating tensions in Korea and the Far East, and stepping up preparations for a new war.

The U.S. argues that it wants to bring new weapons into South Korea, but it has not said a word about the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. Bringing new weapons into South Korea to arm U.S. troops is not necessary at all for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. What is necessary is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The Korean and Chinese sides have consistently advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea since the armistice negotiations, and we still advocate it now.

Major General Zheng Guolu emphasized that the Korean and Chinese sides resolutely oppose the U.S. attempt to violate the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of military reinforcement. Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that the primary task in resolving the Korean issue at this time is to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, to turn the armistice into lasting peace, and to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. To this end, rapid and effective measures must be sought, rather than amending or violating the Armistice Agreement, nor bringing new weapons into South Korea.

Major General Zheng Guolu continued, since the armistice, every time the U.S. has violated the Armistice Agreement and conspired to undermine it, it has falsely accused the Korean and Chinese sides of violating the Armistice Agreement. This time, the U.S. has once again adopted this despicable trick, but it will never succeed.

He said that since the armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have made every possible effort to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Korean and Chinese sides have always strictly abided by all the clauses of the Armistice Agreement and have made sincere and practical efforts to ensure that the Armistice Agreement is not undermined by the U.S. Since the armistice, the U.S. has obstructed the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, consistently violated the Armistice Agreement, and has constantly attempted to undermine the Armistice Agreement. All the facts and relevant records can prove that this cannot be denied by the U.S. with any excuse. The U.S. attempt to violate the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of military reinforcement and to bring new weapons into South Korea cannot be legitimized.

He said that the Armistice Agreement was signed by both parties, and no one has the right to unilaterally amend or abolish it. Any unilateral act by the U.S. to violate the Armistice Agreement is illegal and invalid.

Zheng Guolu strictly demanded that the U.S. immediately cease all acts that violate the Armistice Agreement and abide by all the clauses of the Armistice Agreement. He warned the U.S.: If the U.S. dares to violate the Armistice Agreement in defiance of everything, it will bear full responsibility for the consequences.

Finally, Major General Zheng Guolu stated that the Korean and Chinese sides reserve the right to re-comment on the claims made by the U.S. at today's meeting in the future.

### 美国公然要把新武器运进南朝鲜  朝中方面痛斥美方破坏停战协定

　　美国公然要把新武器运进南朝鲜  朝中方面痛斥美方破坏停战协定
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部今天公然宣布，美国废弃它根据朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项所承担的义务，决定公开把新式武器运进南朝鲜。美国政府已经命令美方在朝鲜军事停战委员会的首席委员今天下午在板门店举行的会议上提出片面废止停战协定这个主要条款的要求。
    美国的这种作法，破坏了朝鲜停战协定的完整性，并且严重地威胁了朝鲜的停战局面和远东和平。但是，美国国防部在它今天发表的美方声明中，居然把它的行动说成是为了“防御”，并且表示打算有条件地遵守停战协定的停火规定和其他条款。
    美国国防部发表的声明，大肆捏造朝中方面违反停战协定运进增援武器的谎言，来辩解美国片面废止停战协定第十三款卯项关于禁止运进增援武器的规定的行为。美国去年片面禁止中立国视察小组在南朝鲜各口岸进行视察，也是使用同样的手法。
    美国这次提出它的破坏停战协定的另一个借口是，在南朝鲜的军队的装备和武器已经陈旧和过时，不能用现有的或目前正在生产的装备和武器来代替。因此它要片面修改停战协定有关条款，以便“保持军事实力的相对平衡”。
    美国国防部的官员们透露，美国早已不顾停战协定的规定，“开始”使在南朝鲜的美国军队现代化，而且李承晚军队的“某种程度的现代化”也在“根据军事援助计划加以考虑，这种现代化包括飞机、通讯设备和自动材料等装备”。
    美国国防部助理部长斯奈德说，“新的喷气式作战飞机将立即开始运往南朝鲜”，这些飞机“显然能够发射原子武器”。
    有记者问斯奈德，在南朝鲜有军队的十个国家是否完全同意美国的决定，他没有正面答复这个问题，只说这些国家得到“每一个机会”来表示它们的意见，他认为没有人表示过反对的意见。他说，这些国家曾经进行了“相当长的时期”的讨论。
    据新华社平壤21日电　汉城消息：远东美军总司令、所谓“联合国军司令”兰尼兹尔已经在今天下午从东京飞到汉城，他将同李承晚商量把新武器运进南朝鲜的问题。
    新华社平壤21日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将今天在委员会会议上严厉谴责了美方粗暴地破坏停战协定的企图，并且提出了最强硬的抗议。
    今天的会议是在美方的建议下举行的。美方首席委员霍默·李曾堡在会上提出，美方认为“它有权利解除根据这个条款（朝鲜停战协定第二条第十三款）的规定所相应承担的义务”，并且要以“新武器来代替旧武器”。
    郑国禄少将在会议上指出，美方不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题，早在停战协定签订的当时就表示没有尊重停战协定的意思，停战后又不断发生违反和破坏停战协定的重要条款的行为。
    美方应该遵守停战协定，但到现在，美方却又一次企图破坏停战协定，以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。美方应该把它的军队撤出朝鲜，但它现在却企图把新型武器运入南朝鲜，把美军对南朝鲜的占领永久化，并且恫吓和镇压反对美国强占者和李承晚集团的南朝鲜人民。美方还企图破坏停战协定，把南朝鲜变为美国的原子战争基地，加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势，加紧准备新战争。
    美方主张要把新型武器运入南朝鲜，但它对外国军队撤出朝鲜的事情则一字未提。把新型武器运入南朝鲜来武装美方的军队，对于和平解决朝鲜问题来说，一点也没有必要，必要的是一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退。朝中方面从停战谈判以来，一向主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，现在仍然这样主张。
    郑国禄少将强调指出，朝中方面坚决反对美方破坏停战协定关于禁止军事增援的规定的企图。郑国禄少将指出，在现时期，解决朝鲜问题的首要任务是使一切外国军队由朝鲜撤走，把停战变为持久和平，以实现朝鲜的和平统一，为此，必须谋求迅速有效的措施，而不是修改或者破坏停战协定，也不是把新型武器运入南朝鲜。
    郑国禄少将继续指出，停战以来，美方每当它违反了停战协定并阴谋破坏停战协定的时候，就反诬朝中方面违反停战协定，这次美方又采取这种卑鄙的惯技，但是它决不能得逞。
    他说，停战以来，朝中方面为了和平解决朝鲜问题作了一切可能作的努力。朝中方面一向严格遵守停战协定的一切条款，为了停战协定不为美方所破坏，进行了真挚的切实的努力。停战以来，美方阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，一贯违反停战协定，并且时时刻刻企图破坏停战协定，所有的事实和有关纪录可以证明，这是美方用任何借口也否认不了的。美方破坏停战协定关于禁止军事增援的规定、把新型武器运入南朝鲜的企图，决不能合法化。
    他说，停战协定是由双方签订的，谁也没有权力片面地修改或者废除它。美方破坏停战协定的任何片面的行为都是非法的、无效的。
    郑国禄向美方严格要求，美方立即终止一切破坏停战协定的行为，并且遵守停战协定的一切条款。他警告美方：假如美方胆敢不顾一切破坏停战协定的话，它就要对其后果负完全的责任。
    最后，郑国禄少将表明，朝中方面今后对于美方在今天会议上提出的主张保留重新加以评论的权利。
