    Nanjing Unifies Purchase and Sale of Scrap and Waste Materials
    Recently, the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee decided to unify the management of the scrap and waste materials market. This will powerfully curb illegal speculative activities in the scrap and waste materials market, and help stabilize prices and promote the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    In the previous period, the prices of many handicraft products and a small number of industrial products rose, one of the main reasons being the rise in raw material prices. A large part of the raw materials used in these products is scrap and waste materials, so merchants took the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits and drive up prices. Some scrap commodities were even more than double the price of new raw materials.
    The Nanjing Municipal People's Committee has established a Secondhand Goods and Waste Products Trust Company, which is specifically responsible for the unified arrangement of the city's scrap commodity purchase, allocation, processing, sorting, repair, and utilization. In the future, government agencies, organizations, industrial and commercial enterprises, troops, schools, and hospitals in the city will handle the disposal of surplus materials such as hardware, transportation and electrical equipment, construction materials, and production raw materials (waste paper, rags, broken glass, various bones, etc.) through unified purchase by the company and its affiliated institutions. ·Wuyang·

    南京统一购销废旧品
    最近，南京市人民委员会决定把废旧品市场统一管理起来。这将有力地制止废旧品市场违法投机活动，有助于稳定物价和增产节约运动的开展。
    前一时期，很多手工业品及少数工业品价格上涨，主要原因之一是原材料价格上升。这些产品使用的原材料，很大一部分是废旧品，因此商贩趁机牟取暴利，哄抬价格，有的废旧商品竟高出新原料价格的一倍以上。
    南京市人民委员会成立了旧货废品信托公司，专门负责统一安排全市废旧商品收购、分配、加工、整理、修配和利用等业务。今后机关、团体、工商企业、部队、学校、医院，在本市处理清出剩余物资如五金、交通电工器材、建筑器材、生产原料（废纸、破布、碎玻璃、各种骨头等），均由该公司及所属机构统一收购。　·伍阳·
