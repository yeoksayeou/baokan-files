    The people of the German Democratic Republic like to call lignite "black gold." Indeed, in a highly developed industrial country that lacks hard coal, natural gas, oil, and hydroelectric resources, it is no exaggeration to compare lignite to gold.
    Lignite is considered invaluable here primarily because it is used as the main fuel for industrial and civilian power generation, gas production, railway transportation, and winter heating throughout the country. However, this is not its only function, because synthetic gasoline, synthetic rubber, the widely used Perlon rayon, some of the coke needed for the metallurgical industry, soap, records, and even headache medicine that people cannot live without are all made from lignite.
    Since lignite is of such great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood in the GDR, the amount of its extraction naturally has a decisive impact on the country's economic construction. The 30th Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in January pointed out: "The speed of our entire economic development depends on the scale of our coal mining and electricity production." The resolution on the 1957 National Economic Plan, passed by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on April 26, also listed maximizing the production of domestic fuel—lignite—as the most important economic task for this year and the next few years. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, workers and technicians in the coal mining industry of the GDR, as well as the broad masses of workers and staff in other related industrial sectors, are currently working hard to complete this most important economic task.
    The GDR's difficulties with insufficient hard coal and steel were caused by the division of Germany. 80% of Germany's hard coal and steel industry is concentrated in the Ruhr area of West Germany; before the war, the coal and steel industry in the area of what is now the GDR only accounted for about 6% of Germany's total coal and steel industry, but the machinery manufacturing industry accounted for about one-third of Germany's total. Therefore, when Germany's economic whole was destroyed due to the division of Germany, there was a fairly serious imbalance between the various industrial sectors in the GDR. In order to overcome this imbalance, the GDR implemented close economic mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries, and, with the help of the Soviet Union, established the Stalin Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, which has six automated blast furnaces, within the first Five-Year Plan. The iron sand and coke used are supplied by the Soviet Union and Poland, respectively. But more importantly, the GDR reduced its economic dependence on West Germany by making the most of its own resources. The GDR does not have much hard coal, but the reserves of lignite are estimated at 25 billion to 30 billion tons. Therefore, it widely uses lignite to replace hard coal.
    Like other industrial sectors, the lignite mining industry also came to a standstill in 1945. In May 1945, the production of lignite and briquettes was less than 17% of pre-war levels. But under the leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, workers and technicians in the GDR rapidly increased the production of lignite. As early as 1948, the extraction of lignite had reached 125% of the 1936 level. In 1950, lignite production reached 137 million tons, and in 1956 it increased to an astonishing 205 million tons. Due to the rapid increase in lignite extraction, the GDR has become the country with the highest lignite production in the world.
    Not only that, but the GDR is also constantly researching new products from lignite. In 1951, scientists in the GDR successfully experimented for the first time with using lignite to refine high-temperature coke required by the metallurgical industry (the calorific value of lignite is 2,600 to 6,200 calories per kilogram, and the calorific value of hard coal is 8,600 calories per kilogram), and also invented the low-shaft furnace ironmaking method based on the characteristics of lignite coke. The Lauchhammer lignite coking plant and the Calbe low-shaft furnace ironmaking plant were established based on their research results. These two new inventions are not only a great contribution to the GDR's economy, but also a unique achievement in the world's science and technology.
    In view of the increasingly widespread use of lignite and the ever-increasing need for coal and electricity for industrial and civilian use, and the fact that the reserves of many existing lignite mines are nearing depletion, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic decided on June 23, 1955, to establish a new lignite base in the "Schwarze Pumpe" area in the southeast. This is the focus of construction during the Second Five-Year Plan. The unexploited lignite reserves in the "Schwarze Pumpe" mining area are estimated to account for 60% of the GDR's total lignite reserves. According to the decision of the Council of Ministers, more than 20 new open-pit lignite mines will be opened in this area, and a lignite joint enterprise including three power plants, three briquette plants, and three coking plants will be established. The first phase of construction will be completed in 1959, and the entire construction is scheduled to be completed in 1963. After all the facilities are put into production, the "Schwarze Pumpe" lignite joint enterprise will extract more than 50 million tons of lignite annually, produce 2.5 million tons of high-temperature coke, 500,000 tons of asphalt and gasoline, 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas, and 900 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Around this new lignite base, several new chemical plants will be built and some new socialist cities like Stalin City will emerge in the future.
    Of course, it cannot be assumed that any country will not encounter this or that difficulty on the road to socialism. Although the GDR's power generation has increased from 19.5 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950 to 31.2 billion kilowatt-hours in 1956, and the per capita electricity consumption exceeds that of all other European countries, the growth rate of power generation still lags behind the growth rate of electricity demand. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, total industrial output increased by 89.6%, while power generation only increased by 47.4%, so that some factories had to stop the operation of some machines when the daily electricity reached its peak load, and some urban and rural areas had to take turns cutting off electricity every day in winter. The shortage of electricity is partly due to the fact that the manufacture of generators cannot meet the needs, and partly due to the fact that the supply of lignite is still not satisfactory, especially the mining of new coalfields is not yet sufficient. From 1948 to 1956, 36 open-pit lignite mines with a total annual output of 90 million tons were mined to exhaustion, while the annual output of new mines that began to be put into production during the same period was only 65 million tons. The GDR's fuel shortage problem is further exacerbated by the fact that almost all European countries are currently experiencing coal shortages (including West Germany, which is rich in hard coal), and Poland, the GDR's main source of hard coal and coke, has also had to temporarily reduce its exports to the GDR due to the increasing domestic demand for hard coal and coke. This situation has placed even greater tasks on the GDR's lignite mining industry.
    In order to overcome the coal supply difficulties and ensure the increasing demand for coal and electricity for industrial and civilian use this year and in the next few years, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic passed a long-term plan on coal mining and electricity production on March 21 this year, which raised the original targets for coal and electricity production and decided to accelerate the construction of the "Schwarze Pumpe" lignite joint enterprise. According to the long-term plan, the output of lignite in 1960 will be increased from the original target of 235 million tons to 248.6 million tons, the output of hard coal will be increased from the original target of 2.7 million tons to 2.96 million tons, and the power generation will be increased from 40.5 billion kilowatt-hours to 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours. Of course, the process of realizing this plan will be a process of arduous struggle. To this end, the GDR government has made corresponding revisions to the national investment plan, and has taken a series of measures such as improving economic leadership, improving labor organization, and strengthening the coordination between various relevant industrial sectors (coal mining, machinery manufacturing, transportation, etc.). The most important of these is to make the broad masses of workers and staff correctly understand the current economic situation and this long-term plan.
    In the first quarter of this year, the GDR's economic construction has already achieved good results. According to the communique published by the State Central Bureau of Statistics on April 30, the state-owned enterprises of the GDR completed 100.5% of the first quarter's production plan, and the industrial production in the first quarter of this year increased by 10% compared with the same period last year; the coal and electricity industry completed 102% of the first quarter's production plan, and its output increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. It cannot be ignored that in the past period, American imperialism and the West German authorities have intensified the Cold War against the GDR politically and economically, and the above-mentioned achievements have been achieved under the circumstances of a very sharp struggle. Moreover, starting from the first quarter of this year, the various industrial sectors of the GDR have also successively implemented a 45-hour work week. The fact that the GDR's first quarter production plan was overfulfilled once again eloquently proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The GDR, which is moving towards socialism, will inevitably overcome various difficulties and move from victory to victory.
    Finally, it must also be pointed out that although the GDR's lignite reserves are estimated to be as high as 25 billion to 30 billion tons, they are not inexhaustible after all. In view of this, the GDR is currently actively engaged in preparations for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and is building the first atomic reactor and atomic power station with the help of the Soviet Union. The GDR has the largest uranium mine in Europe and has outstanding nuclear physicists such as Professor Hertz (winner of the Lenin Prize and the Nobel Prize), so it has various favorable conditions for the widespread use of atomic energy. In the foreseeable future, the task of lignite as a fuel for power generation will be gradually replaced by atomic energy, and lignite will only be used as a raw material for the chemical industry. At that time, "black gold" will create more wealth for the GDR and bring more happiness to the people.

    民主德国的“黑金”——褐煤
    矛弓
    褐煤，民主德国的人们喜欢把它叫做“黑金”。的确，在这样一个工业高度发达，但却缺少硬煤、天然煤气、石油和水力资源的国家里，用金子来比喻褐煤是丝毫也不过份的。
    褐煤之所以在这里被人认为是无价之宝，首先在于全国的工业和民用发电、煤气生产、铁道运输和冬季取暖，无不以它作为主要燃料。不过，这还不是它的全部作用，因为人造汽油、人造橡胶、用途极广的派龙玻璃丝、冶金工业所需的部分焦炭、人们日常生活离不开的肥皂、唱片乃至于头痛药等等，也都是用褐煤作原料制造出来的。
    褐煤对于民主德国的国计民生既然具有如此重大的意义，其开采量的多寡对于国家的经济建设自然就有着决定性的影响。今年1月德国统一社会党第三十次中央全会便曾指出：“我国整个经济发展的速度，取决于我国煤矿开采和电力生产的规模。”德意志民主共和国人民议院4月26日通过的关于1957年国民经济计划的决议，也把最大限度地提高本国燃料——褐煤的产量，列为今年和今后若干年内最主要的经济任务。民主德国煤矿工业的工人和技术人员，以及其他有关工业部门的广大职工，目前正在党和政府的领导之下为完成这项最主要的经济任务而积极努力。
    民主德国硬煤和钢铁不足的困难，是由于德国的分裂而造成的。德国硬煤和钢铁工业80％集中于西德的鲁尔区；战前在现今民主德国地区的煤钢工业，大约只占全德煤钢工业的6％，但机器制造业却占全德的三分之一左右。因此，当德国的经济整体由于德国的分裂而被破坏之后，民主德国各个工业部门之间便出现了相当严重的不平衡。为了克服这种不平衡状态，民主德国和苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及其他社会主义国家实行密切的经济互助，并依靠苏联的帮助而在第一个五年计划之内建立了拥有六座自动化高炉的斯大林钢铁联合企业，所用的铁砂和焦炭则分别由苏波两国供应。但更重要的是，民主德国通过尽量利用本国的资源来减少对西德经济上的依赖。民主德国硬煤不多，但褐煤的蕴藏量却估计有二百五十亿至三百亿吨。因此它便广泛使用褐煤来代替硬煤。
    和其他工业部门一样，褐煤开采工业在1945年也陷于停顿状态。在1945年5月，褐煤和煤砖的产量还不及战前的17％。但在党的领导和苏联无私的援助之下，民主德国的工人和技术人员迅速提高了褐煤的产量。早在1948年，褐煤的开采量就达到了1936年的125％。1950年，褐煤产量达到了一亿三千七百万吨，而1956年更增加到二亿零五百万吨的惊人数字。由于褐煤开采量的突飞猛进，民主德国已经成为世界上褐煤产量最多的国家。
    不仅如此，民主德国同时还在不断研究从褐煤中提炼新的产品。1951年，民主德国的科学家首次试验成功用褐煤来炼制冶金工业所需的高温焦炭（褐煤发热量是每公斤二千六百到六千二百卡洛里，硬煤发热量是每公斤八千六百卡洛里），而且还根据褐煤焦炭的特性发明了低炉炼铁法。劳哈麻的褐煤炼焦厂和卡尔柏的低炉炼铁厂便是根据他们的研究成果建立起来的。这两项新的发明，不仅是对民主德国经济的伟大贡献，而且也是全世界科学技术方面的异采。
    鉴于褐煤的用途日益广泛和工业与民用对煤电的需要在不断增长，而现有的许多褐煤矿的储藏量已接近枯竭，德意志民主共和国部长会议于1955年6月23日决定在东南部的“黑水泵”地区建立新的褐煤基地。这就是第二个五年计划的建设重点。尚未经过开采的“黑水泵”矿区的褐煤蕴藏量，估计占有民主德国全部褐煤蕴藏量的60％。根据部长会议的决定，在这个地区将开辟二十多个新的露天褐煤矿，并建立一个包括三个发电厂、三个煤砖厂和三个炼焦厂的褐煤联合企业。其第一阶段的建设将于1969年完成，全部建设则预定在1963年完成。在全部投入生产之后，“黑水泵”褐煤联合企业每年将开采五千多万吨褐煤，生产二百五十万吨高温焦炭、五十万吨柏油和汽油、三十五亿立方公尺煤气和九亿度电力。在这个新的褐煤基地的周围，将来还要建立若干新的化学工厂和出现一些新的像斯大林城那样的社会主义城市。
    当然，不能设想任何国家在向社会主义前进的道路中，不遭遇这样或者那样的困难。尽管民主德国的发电量已由1950年的一百九十五亿度增为1956年的三百一十二亿度，而且按人口平均计算的电力消耗量超过其他一切欧洲国家，但发电量的增长速度仍然落后于对电力需要量的增长速度。在第一个五年计划的时期内，工业总产量增加了89.6％，而发电量却只增加了47.4％，以致有些工厂在每天电力达到高峰负荷之时，不得不停止部分机器的运转，而有些地区的城市和乡村在冬季也不得不每天轮流停电。电力不足的部分原因是发电机的制造不能满足需要，而另一部分原因便是褐煤的供应量也还不能令人满意，特别是还没有足够地开采新的煤田。从1948年至1956年，已有年产量共达九千万吨的三十六个露天褐煤矿被挖掘枯竭，而同一时期开始投入生产的新矿的年产量却只有六千五百万吨。民主德国燃料不足的问题，又由于这个情况而更为严重，即现在几乎所有欧洲国家都存在着煤炭不足的问题（包括盛产硬煤的西德在内），作为民主德国硬煤和焦炭主要来源的波兰，也因本国对硬煤和焦炭的需要量增加，而不得不暂时减少对民主德国的出口。这种情况便给民主德国的褐煤开采工业提出了更加巨大的任务。
    为了克服煤的供应困难和保证今年和今后若干年内工业和民用对于煤和电日益增长的需要，德意志民主共和国部长会议于今年3月21日通过了一项关于煤矿开采和电力生产的远景计划，提高了煤电生产的原定指标，并决定加速“黑水泵”褐煤联合企业的建设工程。根据远景计划，1960年褐煤的产量将由原定的二亿三千五百万吨增为二亿四千八百六十万吨，硬煤产量由原定的二百七十万吨增为二百九十六万吨，发电量由四百零五亿度增为四百一十五亿度。当然，实现这个计划的过程，将是一个艰巨斗争的过程。为此，民主德国政府已对国家投资计划作了相应的修改，并采取了改进经济领导、改善劳动组织和加强各有关工业部门（煤矿开采、机器制造、交通运输等）之间的配合等一系列的措施。其中最主要的则是使广大职工正确认识目前的经济情况和这个远景计划。
    在今年第一季度，民主德国的经济建设已经获得了良好的结果。根据国家中央统计局4月30日发表的公报，民主德国国营企业完成了第一季度生产计划的100.5％，今年第一季度的工业生产比去年同期提高了10％；煤电工业则完成了第一季度生产计划的102％，其产量比去年同期增加了9％。不能忽略的是，在过去一段时期内，美帝国主义和西德当局在政治上和经济上都曾经加紧了对民主德国的冷战，上述成就是在斗争十分尖锐的情况下取得的。而且，从今年第一季度开始，民主德国的各个工业部门还陆续实行了每周四十五小时的工作制。民主德国第一季度生产计划超额完成的事实，再次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度无比的优越性。正在向社会主义迈进的民主德国，必然能够克服各种困难，从胜利走向胜利。
    最后还必须指出，民主德国的褐煤蕴藏量虽然估计有二百五十亿至三百亿吨之多，但毕竟不是用之不尽取之不竭的。有鉴于此，民主德国目前正在积极从事和平利用原子能的准备工作，并在苏联的帮助之下正在建设第一座原子反应堆和原子能发电站。民主德国拥有欧洲最大的铀矿，并且有像赫尔茨教授（列宁奖金和诺贝尔奖金获得者）这样杰出的核子物理科学家，因而便具备了广泛利用原子能的种种有利条件。在可以预见的将来，褐煤作为发电燃料的任务，就将逐渐为原子能所取代，而褐煤就只用来作为化学工业的原料了。那时，“黑金”就会替民主德国创造更多的财富，替人们带来更多的幸福。
