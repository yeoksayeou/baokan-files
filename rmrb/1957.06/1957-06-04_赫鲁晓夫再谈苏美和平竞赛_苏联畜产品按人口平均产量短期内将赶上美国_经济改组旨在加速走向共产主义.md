Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd. At the opening ceremony of the Soviet Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition on June 2nd, Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stated that we have every possibility during this Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) to make the meat production per capita catch up with the United States, that is, to achieve a total meat production of 20 million to 21 million tons per year. Even if we cannot achieve this task during this period, but complete it in 1961 or even 1962, it will still be a major victory for us. As for milk and oil production per capita, we will be able to catch up with the United States next year, and oil production may even catch up with the United States this year.

Khrushchev pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union has sufficient strength to accomplish the task of making livestock product output per capita catch up with the United States in the next few years. He said that the number of pigs we currently have is almost the same as the United States, and the number of sheep and goats we have is already three times more than the United States. However, in terms of the number of cattle, we are still behind the United States. The reason why we do not get a large amount of beef is because many calves are slaughtered before they grow up.

Khrushchev pointed out that as long as the number of cattle is increased by 8% to 10% each year, as long as some organizational work is done in the collective farms and state farms to raise all the calves, and as long as the feeding of cattle is improved at the cattle receiving stations and on the way to the slaughterhouses, about five million tons more beef can be obtained each year. Khrushchev said that we currently only produce 2.2 million tons of beef.

Khrushchev said that in 1956 we produced 2.6 million tons of pork. The number of pigs in the United States is about the same as ours, but the pork production is 5.5 million tons. This means that as long as the fattening work is done better, even if the number of pigs remains unchanged, we can increase pork production by at least double, that is, by 2.6 million tons, in the next few years. We should also continue to increase the number of pigs in order to increase pork production by about 5 million tons. If these tasks are completed, we will be able to have 10 million tons of pork per year. As for mutton, our current production is already almost one and a half times more than the United States.

In order to make the Soviet Union's milk production per capita catch up with the United States, Khrushchev proposed that annual milk production must be no less than 70 million tons, or 40% more than last year. In the past two years, last year and the year before, milk production increased by 11 million tons, an increase of nearly 30%.

Khrushchev pointed out that the goal of agricultural workers this year is to achieve a bumper harvest of grains, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables, and other crops. At the same time, they must also pay more attention to the development of horticulture and viticulture.

Khrushchev also spoke about the reorganization of industrial management agencies and the achievements of various people's democratic countries in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agriculture. He said that we are now reorganizing industrial management agencies and establishing National Economic Commissions in various economic regions in order to bring leadership closer to factories and the people. Now some people abroad are clamoring that when the Russians made the decision to reorganize industrial management agencies, they apparently focused on military strategic goals, because the decentralized management of industry can create a good condition in which an economic region can exist independently even if other economic regions fail. If bourgeois politicians understand our reorganization work in this way, we will not deny this. This is also important and beneficial. The purpose of our reorganization is not for this, but to raise our economy to a new and higher level and accelerate our advance towards the sacred goal—communism.

Leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government and tens of thousands of visitors attended the opening ceremony of the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition. Bogdanov, the general director of the Agricultural Exhibition, Novakovsky, the general director of the Industrial Exhibition, and some advanced agricultural workers spoke at the meeting. Some agricultural workers also put forward specific guarantees for increasing livestock products.

    赫鲁晓夫再谈苏美和平竞赛
    苏联畜产品按人口平均产量短期内将赶上美国
    经济改组旨在加速走向共产主义
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫6月2日在苏联农业和工业展览会开幕大会上说，我们有一切可能在这个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间使肉类产量按人口平均计算赶上美国，亦即使肉类总产量达到每年生产两千万吨到两千一百万吨。即使我们不能在这个期间实现这个任务的话，而是在1961年或者甚至1962年完成这个任务，那末，这也将是我们的一个重大胜利。至于奶类和油脂按人口平均计算的产量，明年我们就能够赶上美国，而油脂产量甚至今年就可能赶上美国。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出苏联有足够的力量来完成在最近几年内使畜产品产量按人口平均计算赶上美国的任务。他说，我国现有的猪的头数已经差不多和美国一样，而我们的绵羊和山羊的头数已经比美国多三倍。但是，在牛的头数方面，我们仍然落后于美国。我们之所以得不到大量的牛肉，是因为很多小牛还没有长成就被宰杀了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，只要每年增加牛的头数8％到10％，只要在集体农庄和国营农场中做些组织工作，把小牛都养大，只要在牛的验收站和运往屠宰场的途中改善对牛的饲养工作，每年就可以多得到约五百万吨的牛肉。赫鲁晓夫说，而现在我们生产的牛肉只有二百二十万吨。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在1956年我们生产了二百六十万吨猪肉，美国猪的头数同我们差不多，而猪肉产量却有五百五十万吨。这就是说，只要把肥育工作做得好一些，就是猪的头数不变，我们也能够在最近几年内使猪肉的生产量至少增加一倍，即增加二百六十万吨。我们还应该继续增加猪的头数，以便再增加约五百万吨的猪肉。如果完成了这些任务，我们每年就能有一千万吨猪肉。至于羊肉，我们现在的生产量就已经比美国几乎多一倍半。
    为了使苏联的牛奶产量按人口平均计算赶上美国，赫鲁晓夫提出，必须使每年牛奶产量不少于七千万吨，或者比去年多40％。去年和前年两年中，牛奶增产了一千一百万吨，即增加了将近30％。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，农业工作者今年的目标是使谷类、棉花、甜菜、马铃薯、蔬菜以及其他作物获得丰收。同时，他们对发展园艺和葡萄种植业也必须给予更多的注意。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还谈到改组工业管理机构的问题和各人民民主国家在农业的社会主义改造和发展农业方面的成就。他说，现在我们正在改组工业管理机构，正在各个经济地区建立国民经济委员会，以便使领导接近工厂和人民。现在国外有些人在叫嚷说，看样子俄国人在作出改组工业管理机构的决定的时候，显然是着眼于军事战略目的，因为工业的分散管理可以创造这样一种良好的条件，即万一其他经济地区遭到失败的情况下，一个经济地区也可以独立存在下去。如果资产阶级的政客们这样理解我们的改组工作的话，我们也不去否认这一点。这一点也是重要的和有益的。我们改组的目的不是为了这个，而是要把我国经济提高到新的更高的水平，加快向神圣的目的——共产主义前进。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人和成千上万的参观者参加了农业和工业展览会开幕大会。农业展览会总干事波格达诺夫、工业展览会总干事诺瓦科夫斯基和一些先进农业工作者都在会上讲了话，有些农业工作者还提出了增加畜产品的具体保证。
