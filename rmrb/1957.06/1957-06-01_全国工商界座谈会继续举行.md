The National Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium Continues

(Our newspaper dispatch) The symposium for industrial and commercial circles convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee held its thirteenth session yesterday. Speakers at the meeting included Liu Peizhi, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; Wu Jincui, Deputy Director of the Yushengxiang Iron Factory in Beijing (joint state-private); and Feng Hefa, Deputy Director of the General Office and Director of the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Liu Peizhi said: The relationship between the public and private sides within joint ventures in Heilongjiang Province is mostly good, but some are abnormal, such as private personnel having positions without authority, unclear division of labor, public representatives distrusting the private side, acting as replacements, and being biased. The Party's policy is correct, so the occurrence of these abnormal phenomena is due to the serious sectarianism of the public representatives at the lower levels. He said: Joint operation has only been one year, which is a short time, and lack of experience makes some small problems unavoidable. Over the past year, public representatives have played a significant role in promoting production. Without public representatives, it would be problematic for private personnel to fully lead the enterprises. Therefore, public representatives cannot be withdrawn. He believes that the Party member Secretary-General of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, who connects with all parties, plays a significant role in implementing national policies and promoting the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and therefore cannot be withdrawn. He believes that most industrialists and businessmen are seeking progress, but there are still negative aspects, expressed in wavering thoughts, lingering over fixed interest, and being apprehensive about gains and losses. He also reflected on some issues related to wages and benefits, and raised some opinions on the United Front Work Department's focus on the top without considering the bottom.

Wu Jincui advocated: Paying off seven years of fixed interest at once will remove the capitalist label.

"Disagree with Qian Jiaju's opinion"

On May 7, Dagong Bao published an article I wrote about learning from the working class. In the past twenty-odd days, I have seen from the newspapers and heard at many symposiums that some people agree with my view, and some disagree, so I would like to talk about this issue again. I advocate "learning from the working class, and if it is specific to learning from workers and shop assistants, it should be purposeful, measured, and selective, not blind and general. We should firmly grasp their strengths and actively learn, not latch onto their weaknesses and reject learning." Is my thinking wrong? To this day, I still don't think so. Because I haven't seen anyone advocate learning blindly and generally from every worker and shop assistant, nor has anyone advocated grasping their weaknesses to learn. I said that workers and shop assistants with backward ideas and behaviors are "not isolated cases," and no one has been able to say that they "are isolated cases." I said that Chinese workers and shop assistants cannot but have a large proportion of bourgeois or petty-bourgeois peasant thoughts, which has also been further affirmed by many people's speeches. As a problem for research, no one has yet put forward sufficient reasons to overturn my main points.

Mr. Qian Jiaju's speech startled me. Although he declared that he was speaking in a personal capacity, he has often educated and led us over the years. Everyone knows that he is a theoretical expert, and his speech can easily influence or guide the thinking of our industrial and commercial circles. Once he labels someone, many people dare not speak out. He said, "Some people also said that they completely agree that the American bourgeoisie should learn from the Soviet working class, but I cannot understand why the Chinese bourgeoisie should learn from the Chinese working class. In fact, this means a lack of respect for the leadership of the working class." I have repeatedly emphasized the noble qualities of the working class, but I have analyzed that some workers and shop assistants do not fully possess these qualities. I didn't want to extend the backward thoughts of some workers and shop assistants to the entire class. Why did Mr. Qian Jiaju insist that we lumped them together? What's more, people who "don't respect" would never think of learning from the working class. Only those who are convinced of the leadership of the working class will deeply study how to learn from the working class and what to learn.

Mr. Qian Jiaju also said, "Some people cite certain shortcomings of workers in certain enterprises, believing that Chinese workers are not worth learning from..." May I ask, are we not allowed to cite these shortcomings? If citing the shortcomings of some workers means disrespect, then doesn't it mean that we are helping the Communist Party rectify its work today and pointing out the shortcomings of many party members, doesn't that become an even greater "disrespect"? Moreover, who has said such a general statement as "Chinese workers are not worth learning from"?

In addition, there are a few points in Mr. Qian Jiaju's speech that I disagree with, and I will only mention those that Deputy Chairman Bi Mingqi didn't mention.

For example, when Mr. Qian Jiaju talked about the issue of "public-private relations," he said, "Comrade workers are indeed somewhat unfair to the private side. On the one hand, we must strengthen the education of employees. But if industrialists and businessmen think about what they did before liberation from the perspective of the working class, they will be more calm." This means that when we encounter "Comrade workers being unfair to the private side," we should not raise any objections, but only think about the past, not about fairness, but be content with unfairness. In fact, can this kind of talk solve the problem?

"Taking fixed interest is taking care. I propose paying it off in one lump sum with government bonds, leaving no trace of "fixed interest payments."

Regarding the issue of fixed interest, I believe that taking fixed interest is taking redemption money, taking care; it is the exploitation before joint operation, and definitely not the act of exploitation now; the government is only paying now, and there is no so-called debt, and no one says so. I propose: don't drag us into being capitalists by prolonging the payment time. I propose: Calculate the fixed interest based on seven years, and pay off all the remaining amount in one lump sum with ordinary government bonds, leaving no trace of "fixed interest payments," which will make it easier for us to deal with in the future, and the procedures will be simple (voluntary abandonment is allowed).

"Changing joint state-private operation to state-owned is a reasonable, practical, and contradiction-reducing method"

The sign of joint state-private operation can be removed and changed to state-owned. Now it is "joint investment" not "joint operation," because people are not necessarily in this enterprise, and even if they are, major issues are decided by higher authorities, and small issues are led by the public side. The private side is only doing "public work." There is no management to speak of, let alone the exploitative essence of operating for private profit. What kind of public "private" joint operation is this? As for those small businesses that the state has not invested in nor sent people to, they are simply hanging the sign of joint operation in vain. We can consider changing them to state-owned based on voluntary agreement, or maintain private operation. Those who maintain private operation and also employ labor are called capitalists, and the government manages them as private enterprises. The rest are small business owners. This is a reasonable, practical, and contradiction-reducing method.

"The capitalist label should be removed uniformly"

Along with this, the capitalist label can be removed uniformly. Because 1949 to 1955 is seven years, we have already achieved three-quarters of socialism, and the two years from 1956 to 1957 have progressed even faster (because the relations of production have been changed and the material basis has been lost), we can completely achieve the other quarter, ending up with four-quarters (as for the remnants of capitalist ideology, we still need to transform them). In the past, many people ruined their enterprises, but today they have joined the trade union, and some have even become public representatives; in capitalist countries, capitalists can also change their class voluntarily or through bankruptcy, so why can't we?

If not, as a step back, withdrawing public representatives can also be considered by differentiating the situation. Because even if the public representatives are withdrawn, the Party is still in charge. In fact, many of the public representatives are ordinary cadres, workers, demobilized soldiers,... Some of them do not have much socialist enterprise management experience and methods, and some of them do not have high political level, and their role is indeed not great. But I do not advocate a complete withdrawal without analysis. At the same time, we should not regard public representatives as the Party, and confuse the withdrawal of public representatives with obedience to the leadership of the Party.

If not (not changing to state-owned, not removing labels), please also consider again by analogy to the labor insurance regulations, and do not act rashly. We are not gaining an inch after taking an inch, but the preferential treatment plan for those with over 2,000 yuan is too general. Many problems will arise in its implementation. How to deal with appropriate care for those with over 2,000 yuan, but not for those with 4,000 yuan? Like me, a capitalist with 4,000 yuan of capital, the annual fixed interest is 200 yuan. After deducting 40% for buying government bonds and 10% for mutual aid funds, the remaining 50% is 100 yuan, which is more than 8 yuan per month. For the sake of these 8 yuan, the capitalist label is not removed (because there is still 8 jiao...), and no one cares about sick leave wages, medical expenses, and family medical expenses.

So we can't figure it out, we can't give up fixed interest for such capitalists, and we can't enjoy labor insurance. China's health conditions are like this, is this fixed interest a care or a punishment? Is it to make us feel at ease or panic? So I think it's better to allow everyone to remove their labels!

"The upper echelons of the industrial and commercial circles are divorced from the masses"

In recent days, I have felt that the upper echelons of the industrial and commercial circles do have ideas and practices that are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. The middle and lower levels have a lot of opinions when they speak out, which is naturally a contradiction between leaders and those being led. But while we are helping the Communist Party rectify its work, we must also listen to the opinions of the masses. The problems reflected can represent both ourselves and the masses. Otherwise, giving opinions to the Party on the one hand and constantly labeling the masses on the other does not mean that we have no problems at all. I fully agree with the statement made by Deputy Chairman Gong Tianmin the day before yesterday that "the work, study, and thinking of the upper echelons of the industrial and commercial circles are not progressing as fast as the average industrialists and businessmen." Indeed, because the middle and lower levels work a little more than the upper levels, this is the fundamental reason for the faster progress. The middle and lower levels support the upper levels, and without the upper levels, it will not work; the upper levels are elected by the middle and lower levels. But I hope that the upper echelons will go deep into the lower levels, otherwise, the situation reflected will not represent the masses, and they will be taken away by theorists as materials, which will not solve the problem, and those new theories and methods will not be practical, and contradictions will increase instead.

In addition, I also ask theorists who study the problems of the industrial and commercial circles, and comrades who do business in the industrial and commercial circles, to go deep into the middle and lower levels, because natural scientists must take experimental products to the laboratory for research work, and cannot rely solely on books. If social scientists do not go deep into reality, they will inevitably be divorced from reality. Novelists and painters who write in the room and do not experience life will produce things that are neither fish nor fowl. We are really afraid that people who study the work of industrial and commercial circles will make us neither fish nor fowl.

Subjectivism and bureaucratism are terrible, but what is even more terrible is the dogmatism of theorists, because dogmatism comes from subjectivism and bureaucratism, and is creating new and more serious subjectivism and bureaucratism.

Feng Hefa said: We cannot say that other people's different opinions are suppressing "speaking out"

Feng Hefa said: The propaganda and education work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce has great shortcomings. The reason is firstly that the Party does not pay enough attention to and lead the propaganda and education work. In some areas, the Federation of Industry and Commerce is not connected with the propaganda departments of the Party committees, and some professional companies do not pay attention to the education and study work of industrialists and businessmen at all. Secondly, the situation is developing too fast, and our own active efforts are insufficient. We often look at new problems with old eyes. Thirdly, the level of cadres who do propaganda and education work is not high in theory and practice, and we have not improved ourselves in time.

However, we cannot completely negate the achievements of the Federation of Industry and Commerce's propaganda and education work and work over the past few years because of the existence of shortcomings, and we should not randomly label people with dogmatism. Dogmatism must be opposed because it does not combine with reality. But what is dogmatism? This must be clarified. We cannot label theories that do not conform to our own opinions, or other people's criticisms of our own opinions, as dogmatism; nor can we criticize dogmatism with revisionism, or obliterate the basic truths of Marxism-Leninism under the slogan of criticizing dogmatism.

This time, industrialists and businessmen are exposing contradictions in order to help the Party rectify its work, not to rectify the industrialists and businessmen, and no one will disagree with this. However, everyone's opinions cannot be consistent, and there will inevitably be disputes, and disputes are beneficial. We must not label other people's different opinions with dogmatism, or think that they are suppressing the speaking out of industrialists and businessmen. For example, as reported in the Beijing Daily on May 28, Wu Jincui believed that the opinions of others criticizing him in the Beijing industrial and commercial circles symposium were putting pressure on him. Yan Shaoqing believed that Qian Jiaju's speech was putting five labels on industrialists and businessmen. Whether the labels he referred to were really labels or different opinions under discussion, let's not talk about it for the time being, but Yan Shaoqing put three major labels on Qian Jiaju: "serious bureaucratism, dogmatism, and subjectivism." Such labels flying around do not seem to be the proper attitude for contention.

It seems that no one in the industrial and commercial circles now categorically says that they do not want to transform themselves. However, the impression given by some people's statements seems to be that industrialists and businessmen no longer need to transform themselves now, and that saying that industrialists and businessmen still need to transform themselves means that they do not understand the actual situation and are dogmatic. Wu Jincui's article published in Dagong Bao, which talked about learning from the working class and the problems between the private and public sides, believes that the working class and the public side are not more advanced than the industrialists and businessmen. This statement is worth considering. In his speech here a few days ago, Comrade Bi Mingqi gave me and other comrades the same impression, as if capitalist industrialists and businessmen are very progressive now, and that those who still have illegal acts are only those small business owners, small merchants, and handicraftsmen. Regardless of whether the small business owners will shout "injustice," I believe that it is not comprehensive to say that capitalist industrialists and businessmen are very progressive without analysis. In his third speech, Comrade Bi supplemented his own statement, believing that it was not comprehensive that he did not mention the negative aspects of industrialists and businessmen that day. This is a spirit of seeking truth from facts.

The duality of industrialists and businessmen is not only determined by the current dual identity, but mainly determined by the fact that they were a long-term exploiting class in the past.

Some people think that saying that there is still duality now is not analyzing objective facts and is dogmatic. This is a conjecture. The current duality of industrialists and businessmen is manifested on the one hand in the desire to become self-reliant laborers, and on the other hand in the existence of material factors such as fixed interest; on the one hand in the growing desire to contribute to socialist construction, and on the other hand in the existence of capitalist thoughts and feelings. Comrade Qian Jiaju believes that the current dual identity of industrialists and businessmen determines duality, and the direction of transformation is to change the dual identity into a single identity, that is, to change into self-reliant laborers, and to change duality into one side, that is, to establish the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of the working class. I think this statement can be supplemented. The dual identity of industrialists and businessmen is due to the existence of material conditions such as fixed interest. However, even if material conditions such as fixed interest are eliminated and the label of the bourgeoisie is removed, class contradictions will still exist in ideology for a considerable period of time. Therefore, I believe that the current duality of industrialists and businessmen is not only determined by the current dual identity, but mainly determined by the fact that they were a long-term exploiting class in the past, and it is impossible to change their thoughts and feelings all at once without a long period of self-transformation. In a sense, the transformation of the thoughts and feelings of industrialists and businessmen is more difficult and long-term than the change of material relations.

Some people have forgotten that now is a socialist revolution, which is to eliminate exploitation and eliminate classes. They understand the redemption policy as a trading relationship.

The words "redemption" and "fixed interest" should not be understood literally. The redemption policy is a term that distinguishes it from the "expropriation" policy, meaning that the state adopts peaceful transformation methods to change capitalist ownership into socialist public ownership. Because industrialists and businessmen accept and support socialist transformation and have formed an alliance with the working class, the state gives industrialists and businessmen care in material terms, so that industrialists and businessmen gradually change into self-reliant laborers; ideological help is also carried out in the same way, such as political theory learning, participating in socialist competitions, conducting self-education with enterprises as the base, and appropriately carrying out criticism and self-criticism, etc., to change the thoughts and feelings of industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, there is no fundamental issue of "redeeming to the end" or other issues that understand the redemption policy as "bargaining" or "equal exchange."

However, there are some people in the industrial and commercial circles, represented by Li Kangnian, who believe that redemption should be redeemed to the end, and the fixed interest period should be extended to twenty years. There are also some proposals to issue redemption deposit certificates and redemption bonds. What kind of thinking does this opinion reflect? I believe that some people in the industrial and commercial circles seem to have forgotten that our current revolution is a socialist revolution, the purpose of which is to eliminate private ownership of the means of production, eliminate exploitation, eliminate classes, and establish a socialist society. They understand the state's policy of peaceful transformation of industrialists and businessmen as a trading relationship, and understand China's socialist revolution as the reformism of the British Labor Party, which is a disguised form of capitalism. Therefore, I believe that what should be studied is how industrialists and businessmen can better transform themselves into the working class with the material assistance of the state, and there is no fundamental issue of the length of the fixed interest period and from which year the redemption should be calculated. Comrade Qian Jiaju correctly said on the one hand that how to calculate the redemption is not necessary to talk about at all, and the more you talk about it, the more confused you become, while on the other hand he believes that the redemption should be calculated from 1949, which is also a contradiction. I believe that fixed interest for seven years is calculated generously. During such a long period of time, most of the industrialists and businessmen will definitely be able to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers according to the principle of distribution according to work. Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that as long as they are willing, they can automatically give up fixed interest, and those who still have difficulties after seven years can drag a tail. This is the spirit of seeking truth from facts to help industrialists and businessmen transform themselves, and fully embodies the state's attention and help to industrialists and businessmen. If we forget or abandon the major premise of socialist revolution, it will be difficult to discuss all the problems.

Capitalists' patriotism is not equal to loving socialism

The transformation of industrialists and businessmen from this class to another class, to describe this qualitative change in colloquial terms, is "rebirth." There is nothing wrong with these four words. However, some industrialists and businessmen think that "this is too terrible," and think that "we have handed over the enterprise, and we still have to be skinned and boned." This may be a misunderstanding, but in essence it also means that further transformation is no longer needed. What puzzles me is that Comrade Zhang Naiqi described "rebirth" as faithism and mysticism, and believes that industrialists and businessmen have already passed five levels, and that still saying that they need to be reborn will increase the endless worries of industrialists and businessmen. This is not only a misunderstanding of these four words, but also reflects the feelings of some industrialists and businessmen. Not all industrialists and businessmen agree with Comrade Zhang Naiqi's statement. Comrade Le Songsheng believes that the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen is a kind of "rebirth."

China's national bourgeoisie is a patriotic class, and there will be no dispute about this. However, if we say that, except for individual capitalists who betray their own class and can move towards socialism, the average capitalists' patriotism is not equal to loving socialism, and even it is impossible to love socialism, is this statement an objective truth or dogmatism? During the national and democratic revolution, didn't the bourgeoisie participate in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle because the development of capitalism was oppressed? In the early days of liberation, didn't the bourgeoisie have a strong desire to develop capitalism, so that the struggle between restriction and anti-restriction became the main domestic contradiction in China's transition period? In the upsurge of the socialist revolution in 1956, Chinese capitalists were able to beat gongs and drums to accept the joint state-private operation of the entire industry and hand over the enterprises to the state. This is definitely a glorious thing and made a contribution to the country. However, if it were not for the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private capitalism to gradually guide it to state capitalism since liberation, without this long-term process of quantitative change, would there have been such a qualitative change as the joint state-private operation of the entire industry in 1956? Is it because the state has long-term persuasive education work and gradually changed the relations of production of private enterprises that industrialists and businessmen can accept socialism without too much reluctance, but because capitalists consciously love socialism and therefore move towards socialism? Saying that capitalists' patriotism is not equal to loving socialism, is this dogmatism or objective reality? Past facts cannot be erased. After the joint state-private operation of the entire industry, material relations have changed, and ideological relations are also changing. It is possible for capitalists to gradually develop feelings for socialism from accepting socialism without too much reluctance. However, at present, except for a few individuals, it seems a little too early to say that the average person already loves socialism. In the future, industrialists and businessmen can love socialism as they further complete the transformation in both material and ideological aspects, but at this time industrialists and businessmen have become a part of the working class, that is, they have been reborn.

In addition, he also expressed his opinions on learning from the working class, the issue of the powers of industrialists and businessmen, etc.

### 全国工商界座谈会继续举行

专栏：

    全国工商界座谈会继续举行
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会，昨天举行第十三次座谈。会上发言的有全国工商联常委、黑龙江省工商联主委刘佩芝、北京市公私合营裕生祥铁工厂副厂长吴金萃、全国工商联办公室副主任兼宣传处处长冯和法。
    刘佩芝说：黑龙江省合营企业内公私关系大部分是好的，也有一部分不正常，如私方人员有职无权，分工不明确，公方代表不信任私方，包办代替，偏听偏信等。党的政策是正确的，所以会发生这种不正常现象，是下边公方代表存在严重的宗派主义思想。他说：合营才一年，日子还少，缺乏经验，发生一些小问题是难免的。一年来，公方代表对推动生产起了很大作用，没有公方代表，让私方人员全面领导企业还有问题，因此公方代表不能撤。他认为工商联党员秘书长联系各方面，对贯彻国家政策，推动工商联工作作用很大，也不能撤。他认为大多数工商业者是要求进步的，但是消极一面还有，表现思想动摇，留恋定息、患得患失。他还反映了工资福利方面的一些问题，并对统战部统上不统下提了一些意见。吴金萃主张：七年定息一次付清，资本家的帽子随着摘掉
    “不同意千家驹的意见”
      5月7日大公报把我写的关于向工人阶级学习的一篇文章发表了。在这二十多天里，我从报上看到、在不少的座谈会上听到，有些人同意我的看法，也有些人不同意，所以我还要谈谈这个问题。我主张“向工人阶级学习，如果具体到向工人店员去学，应当是有目的、有分寸、有选择的去学，而不是盲目的、笼统的去学。应当紧紧的抓住人家的优点主动的去学，而不是啃住了缺点拒绝学习。”我的想法错了么？到今天我仍不以为然。因为我还没看到有人主张要盲目的笼统的向每个工人、店员去学，也没有人主张抓住人家的缺点去学。我说有落后思想和行为的工人店员“不是个别的”，也还没有人能讲出“是个别的”。我说中国工人店员不能不具有很大分量的资产阶级思想或农民的小资产阶级思想，也为许多人的发言加以进一步肯定。作为一个问题来研究，至今还没有人提出足够的理由来推翻我的几个主要论点。
    千家驹先生的发言吓了我一跳，他虽声明他是以私人资格发言的，但几年来他是经常教育、领导我们的，谁都知道他是理论专家，他一发言很能影响或引导我们工商界的思想。他一扣帽子，很多人不敢鸣了。他说“又有人说要说美国资产阶级向苏联工人阶级学习完全同意，要中国资产阶级向中国工人阶级学习我想不通，这里面其实就意味着一个对工人阶级领导不服气的问题”。我曾一再强调工人阶级的高贵品质，不过分析了若干工人店员还不完全具备这种品质，并没有想把若干工人店员的落后思想推广到整个阶级上，为什么千家驹先生却硬说我们把它扯到一起了呢？更何况“不服气”的人根本不会想到向工人阶级学习的问题，只有对工人阶级领导服了气的人们，才会深入研究如何向工人阶级学习和学什么的问题。
    千家驹先生又说“有人举出某些企业工人某些缺点，认为中国工人是不值得学习的……”请问难道不许举出这些缺点么？举出来某些工人的缺点就是不服气，那么今天我们帮助共产党整风，提出许多党员的缺点岂不成了更大的“不服气”？何况谁又说过“中国工人是不值得学习的”这样一句笼统的话？
    另外在千家驹先生的发言里还有几点我不同意，这里只提毕鸣岐副主委没提到的。
    比如千家驹先生在谈到“公私关系”问题时，说“工人同志对私方确有些不大公平的地方，这一方面要加强职工教育，但工商业者如把解放前所作所为设身处地想一想，也就会心平气和一些了”。这就是说我们遇到“工人同志对私方不大公平的时候”，不要提意见了，只要想以前，不要想公平，而要安心于不公平。事实上这样谈解决得了问题么？
    “拿定息是拿照顾，我主张用公债票一次付给，不留什么“定息款”的痕迹
    关于定息问题，我认为拿定息是拿赎买金，是拿照顾；是合营以前的剥削，而绝对不是现在的剥削行为；政府只是现在付款，而无所谓欠债，也没有人这么说。我主张：不要这样为付款延长时间而拖着我们当资产阶级分子了。我主张：按七年计算定息，除去已付的，一律用普通的公债票一次付给，不留什么“定息款”的痕迹，将来我们也便于处理，手续也简单（自愿的可以放弃）。
    “公私合营改成国营，这是合情合理、切合实际、减去无穷矛盾的办法”
    公私合营的牌子可以摘掉，改国营。现在是“合资”不是“合营”，因为人既不一定在本企业，即使在企业的，也是大的问题由上级决定，小问题由公方领导，私方只是作“公职工作”，谈不上经营，更没有为私人利润而经营的剥削实质，这叫什么公“私”合营呢？至于那些国家未投资，也未派人去的小户更是空挂合营的牌子，可以考虑根据自愿改为国营或仍维持私营，维持私营而又雇用劳动力的叫作资本家，政府按私营管理。其余是小业主。这是合情合理、切合实际、减去无穷矛盾的办法。
    “资本家的帽子一律摘掉”
    随着，资本家的帽子可以一律摘掉。因为1949到1955是七年，我们已经取得四分之三社会主义，1956到1957这二年进步更快（因为已经改变了生产关系，失去了物质基础），完全可以取得另外的四分之一，落得个四分之四（至于资本主义思想残余还是要改造的）。以前有不少人把企业搞垮了，今天已入工会，并且有的当了公方代表；在资本主义国家里，资本家还可以根据自愿或破产而改变阶级，我们怎么不能呢？
    如果不是这样，退一步，撤出公方代表也是可以分别不同情况考虑的。因为撤了公方代表还有党在领导，事实上公方代表当中有很多是一般干部、工人、转业军人，……有的并没有什么社会主义企业管理经验和办法，有的政治水平也并不高，起的作用确实不大。但我不主张不加分析地全部撤出，同时，也不要把公方代表就看成是党，把撤出公方代表和服从党的领导混淆起来。
    如果不是这样（不改国营、不摘帽子），比照劳保条例的办法也请再加考虑，不要草率从事。我们不是得寸进尺，而是二千元以上的照顾办法实在太笼统了。执行起来会发生很多问题。二千元以上的适当照顾，四千元的照顾不照顾呢？像我是个四千元股本的资本家，每年定息二百元，除去买公债40％，交互助金10％，余50％为一百元，每月合八元多。为了这八元多，资本家的帽子戴着不提（因为还有八角的……），病假工资、医药费、家属医药费就没有人管了。
    那么我们又想不通了，对这样的资本家放弃定息不行，享受劳保不行，中国人的健康条件又是如此，究竟这定息是照顾呢？还是惩罚呢？是使我们安心呢？还是心慌呢？所以我想还是都允许摘了帽子吧！
    “工商界上层脱离群众”
    这些日子以来我感到工商界上层确有脱离群众、脱离实际的想法和作法。中下层鸣放起来意见很大，这自然是领导与被领导之间的矛盾，但我们一方面帮助共产党整风，一方面也要多听群众意见，反映出来的问题，才能既代表自己也代表群众，否则一方面给党提意见，一方面不断地给群众扣帽子，并不等于自己完全没问题。我十分赞同巩天民副主委前天谈的“目前工商界上层人物的工作、学习、思想都没有一般工商业者进步快”这句话。确实，因为中下层劳动是比上层多一点的，这就是进步快的根本原因。中下层都拥护上层，没有上层不成；上层是中下层选举出来的。但希望上层深入下层，否则反映情况不代表群众，被理论家们搞了去当资料，解决不了问题，那些新的理论、办法又不切合实际，矛盾反而增加。
    另外，也要求研究工商界问题的理论家，和作工商界业务的同志们，深入中下层，因为自然科学家必须把实验品拿到实验室里来作研究工作，不能光靠书本。社会科学家们若是不深入实际，必然脱离实际。小说家、画家坐在屋里写作，不体验生活，弄出来的东西就是不伦不类的，我们真怕研究工商界工作的人们把我们搞得不伦不类。
    主观主义、官僚主义固然可怕，但更可怕的是理论家们的教条主义，因为教条主义是从主观主义和官僚主义来的，并且在制造新的更厉害的主观主义和官僚主义。冯和法说：不能把别人不同的意见说是打击“鸣”“放”
    冯和法说：工商联的宣教工作存在很大的缺点，其原因首先是党对宣教工作注意和领导不够，有些地区工商联和党委宣传部门挂不上钩，有些专业公司根本不重视工商业者的教育学习工作。其次是形势发展过快，我们自己主动的努力不足，常常以旧眼光来看新问题。再次是我们作宣教工作的干部在理论和实践方面水平不高，没有及时提高自己。
    但是，我们不能因为存在缺点，就全盘否定几年来工商联宣教工作和工作上的成就，更不应该把教条主义的帽子到处乱扣。教条主义是必须反对的，因为它不结合实际。但是，什么是教条主义？这必须弄清楚，不能把不合自己意见的理论，或者别人对自己意见的批评，都扣上教条主义的帽子；也不能以修正主义来批评教条主义，或者在批评教条主义的口号下抹杀了马克思列宁主义的基本真理。
    这次工商业者揭露矛盾，是为了帮助党整风，而不是对工商业者整风，这是谁都不会有不同意见的。但是，大家的意见不可能是一致的，免不了会有争论，而且争论是有好处的，决不能对别人不同的意见扣上教条主义帽子，或者就认为是在打击工商业者的鸣放。例如5月28日北京日报所载，北京工商界座谈中，吴金萃把别人批评他的意见认为是在对他加压力。阎少青认为千家驹的发言是给工商业者扣上五顶帽子，他所指的帽子是否真的是帽子还是讨论中的不同意见，姑且不谈，而阎少青给千家驹带上了“严重的官僚主义、教条主义和主观主义”三大帽子。这样的帽子乱飞，似乎也不是争鸣的应有态度。
    现在工商业者中似乎没有人斩钉截铁地说自己不要改造了，但是，有一些人的说法给人的印象似乎现在工商业者不要再改造了，认为说工商业者还要改造，就是不了解实际情况，就是教条主义。吴金萃在大公报上所发表的文章，谈到向工人阶级学习和私方与公方的问题，就是认为工人阶级和公方并不比工商业者进步。这种说法是值得考虑的。前几天毕鸣岐同志在这里的发言，我和别的同志有同样的印象，仿佛资本主义工商业者现在都是很进步的，现在还有不法行为的只是那些小业主、小商贩和手工业者。姑且不论小业主们是否会喊“冤枉”，我认为不加分析，说资本主义工商业者都是很进步，这样的说法是不全面的。毕同志在第三次发言中对于自己的说法作了补充，认为那天没有提到工商业者的消极一面，是不全面的。这是一种实事求是的精神。
    工商业者目前的两面性不仅是由现在的两重身分所决定，而且主要的是由过去长期是一个剥削阶级所决定
    有的人认为，现在还说有两面性，是对客观事实不加分析，是教条主义。这是一种臆测之词。目前工商业者的两面性表现在一方面要求成为自食其力的劳动者，一方面还存在定息等物质因素；一方面日益增长着为社会主义建设贡献力量的愿望，一方面还存在着资本主义的思想感情。千家驹同志认为工商业者目前的两重身分决定两面性，改造的方向就是两重身分变成为一种身分，即改变为自食其力的劳动者，两面性变成为一面，即建立工人阶级的立场、观点和方法。我认为这话还可以加以补充。工商业者的两重身分是由于定息等物质条件尚还存在所致，然而即使定息等物质条件取消，摘去了资产阶级的帽子，思想方面在相当长一个时期内还是会存在阶级矛盾的。所以，我认为，工商业者目前的两面性不仅是由于现在的两重身分所决定，而且主要的是由于过去长时期是一个剥削阶级，思想感情如不经过较长时期的自我改造，是不可能一下子改变过来的。在某种意义上说，工商业者思想感情的改造比物质关系的改变，还要艰巨些、长期些。
    有些人忘了现在是社会主义革命，是消灭剥削，消灭阶级，他们把赎买政策理解为买卖关系
    “赎买”“定息”这些字句，是不应该从字面去理解的，赎买政策是区别于“剥夺”政策的一个用语，意思是国家采用和平改造方法来改变资本家所有制为社会主义公有制。由于工商业者接受和拥护社会主义改造，并且和工人阶级结成了同盟，所以国家在物质方面给予工商业者照顾，使工商业者逐步的改变为自食其力的劳动者；在思想方面同样进行一系列的帮助，如政治理论学习、参加社会主义竞赛，以企业为基地进行自我教育，以及适当的展开批评与自我批评等，以改变工商业者的思想感情。所以，根本不存在“赎买到底”等各种把赎买政策理解为“讨价还价”“等价交换”等问题。
    但是，工商界中有一些人，以李康年为代表，认为赎买就应该赎买到底，定息期间应该延长到二十年，还有一些发行赎买存单、赎买公债的主张。这种意见反映一种什么思想呢？我认为，工商界中有一些人似乎忘记了我们现在的革命是社会主义革命，目的是消灭生产资料私有制，消灭剥削，消灭阶级，建立社会主义社会。他们把国家对工商业者进行和平改造的赎买政策理解为一种买卖关系，把我国的社会主义革命理解为英国工党的改良主义，也就是一种变相的资本主义。所以，我认为应该研究的是如何在国家的物质帮助下使工商业者更好地改造自己为工人阶级的问题，而根本不存在定息的年限长短和赎买从那年算起等问题。千家驹同志一方面很正确地说，赎买如何计算是根本不必谈的，而且越谈越糊涂，而另方面他又认为赎买应从1949年算起，这也是一种矛盾。我认为定息七年是从宽计算，在这样长时期中，工商业者的大部分一定能够改造成为根据按劳取酬原则，自食其力的劳动者。薄一波副总理说过，只要自愿，也可自动放弃定息，七年后还有困难的，可以拖一个尾巴。这是帮助工商业者改造的实事求是的精神，充分体现了国家对工商业者的重视和帮助。如果忘记或者抛弃社会主义革命这个大前提，一切问题就很难讨论下去。
      资本家爱国不等于爱社会主义
    工商业者由这个阶级变到另个阶级，把这种质变用通俗的话来形容，就是“脱胎换骨”。这四个字并没有什么不好。但是，有些工商业者认为“这太可怕”，认为“我们交出了企业，还要对我们抽筋剥皮”。这可能是一种误解，实质上也就是认为不再需要进一步改造。使我不解的是，章乃器同志把“脱胎换骨”说成信仰主义、神秘主义，认为工商业者已经过了五关，现在还说要脱胎换骨，会增加工商业者无穷忧虑。这不只是对这四个字的误解，实质上也反映了一些工商业者的感情。并不是所有工商业者都同意章乃器同志的说法的，乐松生同志就认为工商业者的自我改造是一种“脱胎换骨”。
    我国民族资产阶级是一个爱国的阶级，这是不会有争论的。但是，如果说，除了个别的资本家背叛自己的阶级，能够走向社会主义外，一般的资本家爱国不等于爱社会主义，甚至不可能爱社会主义。这样说法是客观的真理还是教条主义呢？在民族、民主革命时期，资产阶级不是为了发展资本主义受到了压迫而参加反帝反封建斗争的吗？在解放初期，资产阶级难道没有强烈的发展资本主义愿望，因而使限制与反限制的斗争成为我国过渡时期的国内主要矛盾？1956年社会主义革命高潮中，我国资本家能够敲锣打鼓接受全行业公私合营，把企业交给国家，这肯定的是一件光荣的事，对国家作出了贡献，但是，如果不是解放以来，国家通过利用限制改造的政策，把私人资本主义逐步引导到国家资本主义，没有这种长时期的量变过程，那会有1956年全行业公私合营这样的质变呢？工商业者能够不太勉强地接受社会主义，难道不是由于国家长时期的说服教育工作和逐步改变私营企业的生产关系的缘故，而是资本家自觉地热爱社会主义因而走向社会主义吗？说资本家爱国不等于爱社会主义，这是教条主义还是客观的现实，过去的事实是不能抹杀的。全行业公私合营以后，物质关系改变，思想关系也在改变中，资本家一般由不太勉强地接受社会主义而慢慢地对社会主义发生感情是可能的，但在目前除了个别的人外，说一般的人都已爱社会主义，那似乎为时过早了一些。今后，工商业者随着物质和思想两方面进一步改造完成，是可以爱社会主义的，但是这个时候工商业者已经成为工人阶级的一部分，也就是已经脱胎换骨了。
    此外，他还对向工人阶级学习，工商业者的职权问题等发表了意见。
