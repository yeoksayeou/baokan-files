Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on May 30th regarding Britain's decision to relax trade restrictions with China, stating that the U.S. was "deeply disappointed" by Britain's action. The U.S. itself does not intend to change its policy of implementing a "complete embargo" on trade with China.

Washington officials privately referred to Britain's actions as an "open and decisive break" in Anglo-American relations, saying that the impact could not yet be predicted.

Associated Press reporter Hightower said that Britain's action was the "most painful diplomatic defeat" that London had inflicted on Washington since the joint Anglo-French invasion of Egypt last year.

The State Department's statement said that at the recent meeting of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) in Paris, the United States insisted on maintaining differential trade controls on China, believing that this would best promote the "security interests" of the "free world." However, Britain, with the support of some countries, believed that there was no benefit in having a level of control over trade with China that was different from the level of control over trade with the Soviet Union, and therefore Britain believed that this difference should be completely eliminated.

U.S. officials openly expressed concern that Britain's decision would trigger a "chain reaction," and that other countries that conduct a large amount of trade with China or hope to increase such trade, such as Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy, would soon follow Britain's example, leading to the collapse of U.S. efforts to keep its allies maintaining stricter restrictions on China than on the Soviet Union.

News reports said that Britain's action is expected to provoke a strong reaction in two directions in the U.S. Congress. Some people will come out to vehemently oppose it, including Republican Senate leader Knowland. Others will use this opportunity to re-attack the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy. For example, Senator Fulbright said that Britain's action is "further evidence that the U.S. policy toward China is very ineffective and cannot be expected to lead to any purpose."

Some in Congress will say that since the embargo system has collapsed, the United States must be realistic. A movement to restore trade in non-strategic goods with China is already underway in Congress, led by Democratic Senator Magnuson. A special subcommittee of the Senate led by him is now preparing to hold hearings on the U.S. government's refusal to relax the "embargo."

Agence France-Presse's Washington correspondent analyzed the current situation facing the United States, saying that Britain's decision was made a few days after the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan, and coincided with the U.S. press's opposition to the State Department's ban on American journalists traveling to China. Therefore, this decision immediately raises a question for the Eisenhower administration: is the U.S. government willing to isolate itself on the China issue, or is it willing, on the contrary, to prepare to painfully revise its policies, regardless of the opposition of the Congressional "China Lobby"? The reporter also said that in a few months, the United Nations General Assembly will meet in New York, and the issue of admitting China will be raised again at that time, and the circumstances under which this issue is raised will certainly be different from those of past sessions of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 31st: British newspapers have reacted sharply to the United States' disappointment over Britain's decision to relax the trade embargo on China.

The "Financial Times" stated in an editorial today that the U.S. attitude is partly political and partly psychological. Politically, relaxing trade restrictions will cause the U.S. government to quarrel with a group of powerful senators who believe that any concessions to Beijing are a betrayal of American interests and will cause "overseas Chinese to look to Beijing for leadership."

Psychologically, relaxing trade restrictions will bring back memories of the Korean War, "in which the United States suffered 100,000 casualties and fell into a painful stalemate rather than achieving victory."

The newspaper said that for America's allies, "the issue must be judged with a more realistic and less emotional attitude."

The "Financial Times" emphasized that China does have sterling funds that it can use to expand trade with Britain.

The editorial concluded that many of Britain's allies and competitors will certainly follow Britain's decision.

    担心英国行动引起链锁反应
    美国国务院表示“非常失望”
    据新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院30日就英国放宽对华贸易限制的决定发表声明说，英国这个行动使美国“非常失望”。美国自己不打算改变它对同中国的贸易实行“全面禁运”的政策。
    华盛顿的官员私下把英国的行动称为英美关系“公开大决裂”，他们说，其影响如何还不能预言。
    美联社记者海托华说，英国的行动是英国去年同法国联合进攻埃及以来，伦敦使华盛顿在外交上受到的“最沉痛的失败”。
    国务院的声明说，在最近举行的巴黎统筹委员会上，美国坚持要保持对中国实行差别贸易管制，认为这样才会最好地促进“自由世界”的“安全利益”。但是英国在某些国家的支持下却认为：对中国的贸易实行的管制的水平不同于对苏联的贸易管制的水平，是没有什么好处的，因此英国认为，这种差异应该完全取消。
    美国官员们公开表示担心，英国的决定将引起“链锁性反应”，同中国进行大量贸易或者希望增加这种贸易的其他国家，如日本、西德、法国和意大利在不久的将来会学英国的样，从而导致美国使它的盟国对中国保持比对苏联更为严格的限制的努力的瓦解。
    消息说，预料英国的行动将在美国国会引起两方面的激烈反应。一些人要出来竭力反对，其中包括共和党参议院领袖诺兰。其他的人则将利用这一机会来重新抨击艾森豪威尔政府的外交政策。例如参议员富布赖特说，英国的行动是“又一证据，证明美国的对华政策非常无效，不能期望它导向任何目的。”
    国会里有些人会说，既然禁运制度已经崩溃，美国必须实事求是。国会里已经在展开一个恢复同中国进行非战略物资的贸易运动，这是民主党参议员麦格纳逊领导的。他领导的参议院一个特别小组委员会现在正准备就美国政府拒绝放宽“禁运”举行意见听取会。
    法新社驻华盛顿记者分析美国目前面临的局势说，英国这个决定是在台湾发生反美示威以后几天作出的，又恰逢美国报界起来反对国务院禁止美国记者前往中国的时候，因此这一决定马上对艾森豪威尔政府提出一个问题：美国政府愿意在对中国问题上使自己陷于孤立呢，还是相反地愿意不顾国会“院外援华集团”的反对而准备忍痛修改它的政策。记者还说，几个月之后，联合国大会将在纽约开会，接纳中国参加的问题那时将再次提出，而这个问题提出的情况将肯定地和联合国过去几届会议上的情况不同。
    据新华社伦敦31日电　英国报纸对于美国因英国决定放宽对华贸易禁运而失望一事有尖锐的反应。
    “金融时报”今天在社论中指出，美国的这种态度一部分是政治上的，一部分是心理上的。在政治上，放宽贸易限制将使美国政府同一批有势力的参议员们争吵起来，因为这些参议员认为对北京的任何让步都是出卖美国的利益，并且将使“在国外的华侨瞩望北京领导”。
    在心理上，放宽贸易限制将使人们回忆起朝鲜战争，“美国在这次战争中伤亡了十万人，并且陷入了痛苦的僵局而不是取得胜利”。
    这家报纸说，对于美国的盟国来说，“必须用比较现实的而不是那末感情用事的态度来判断问题”。
    “金融时报”着重指出，中国的确拥有英镑基金，它可以扩大对英国的贸易。
    社论最后预料，英国的许多盟国和竞争者肯定会遵循英国的这个决定。
