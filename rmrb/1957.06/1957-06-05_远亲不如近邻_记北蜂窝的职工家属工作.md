    Distant Relatives Are Not As Good As Close Neighbors
    ——A Record of the Work of the Staff and Family Members in Beifengwo
  　Zhang Yuan
    In the western suburbs of Beijing, there is a place called Beifengwo, where more than 1,000 households of staff and family members of the Beijing Railway Administration live. They are organized into sixty-seven family groups, and they have elected people they love to form the staff and family committee and ten branches. This staff and family organization, relying on the strength of the family members, has solved many difficulties for the staff families in the past four years.
    More than four years ago, Beifengwo was still a desolate place. It was ten or twenty miles from here to the hospital, and there was no health center nearby. Among the dozens of staff and family members who moved here, there were seven pregnant women, who were all afraid of not being able to find someone to deliver the baby when they were about to give birth. The family committee found Granny Wu, who had learned new methods of midwifery, in a nearby village, and agreed with her to come and deliver the babies for the mothers when the time came. At that time, there was no oil and salt shop or cooperative in Beifengwo, and the family members had to travel ten or eight miles to buy grain and vegetables each time. The family committee took the initiative to talk to a nearby vegetable garden and arranged for them to deliver vegetables here for sale. They also organized mutual assistance for buying coal and grain in a unified manner.
    Pooling Efforts to Solve Difficulties
    Since 1954, the family committee has used the power of the masses to solve their own difficulties. Currently, there are three laundry groups here, with thirty-three households participating. They wash clothes for single staff members, pick them up and deliver them to their homes, and the price is cheaper than outside. A sewing group has also been organized, with more than a dozen people participating, and a contract has been signed with the supply station to make clothes. In this way, some families in difficulty have also increased their income. The problem of staff members' laundry and sewing has also been solved. Staff member Wang Muzhou used to earn 45 yuan a month, and his family of nine had a difficult life. After Wang's wife joined the laundry group, her monthly income increased by 30 to 40 yuan. Not only did they have enough to eat and wear, but they also bought three new quilts, a bicycle, and a sewing machine in the past three years. Wang Muzhou is also more motivated in production.
    The family members in Beifengwo also organized mutual assistance. When a staff member named Tian Zhaofu was on a business trip, Tian's wife had a postpartum hemorrhage. The mutual assistance group invited a doctor to treat her and helped with cooking and taking care of the children. When Tian Zhaofu came back and saw that she was taken care of so well and that both mother and child were safe, he said to the family members of the mutual assistance group, "You have helped my family, and you have not delayed production, which is also supporting national construction." The family members said, "It is true that distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors." The number of people who voluntarily participated in mutual assistance is increasing day by day. Staff member Du Shirun had seven children, and three children were sick at the same time. The mutual assistance group took care of two children and housework, so that Du's wife could take her child with pneumonia to the hospital with peace of mind, and Lao Du did not ask for leave because of this. At present, there are 895 people participating in mutual assistance in the entire residential area, and in 1956, they helped 6,423 mothers and patients. There were many children in Liu Zizhen's family, and the sanitation was not good. The mutual assistance group sent nine people to help dismantle and wash the bedding and clean the house thoroughly. Old Liu and his wife were moved to tears. When worker Bai Fengquan got married, the woman wanted a band to greet the bride, but the man could not afford it, so the family members organized a waist drum team to greet the bride together. As a result, both the groom's and bride's families were very happy.
  The family committee also organized savings mutual assistance, mobilizing the masses to participate voluntarily, and the masses elected honest and reliable people to manage the accounts. In 1956, 701 families participated in savings mutual assistance, with savings of 5,112.50 yuan. In one year, it was turned over 686 times, including 79 times for postpartum care, 377 times for medical treatment, 91 times for tuition fees, and 139 times for other urgent needs in life.
    In the spring of last year, the family committee combined the publicity of the "Five Goods" and arranged for each branch to pay attention to discovering and cultivating model families. Under the leadership of the model families, those who had no plans for family expenses in the past now know how to manage their lives; quarrels between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and between husbands and wives have also been greatly reduced.
  Organize Learning for Common Progress
    The staff and family members here often say that culture is a "treasure" that makes it easier to progress and do things. Therefore, literacy classes were held as early as 1953. Last year, more than 400 family members asked to learn culture. The family committee mobilized the masses to recommend teachers and mobilized family intellectuals to come out as teachers automatically. Eight teachers were found. The committee also mobilized family members to give up three rooms, and everyone worked together with the workers in the construction section to turn the rooms into classrooms. The trade union used money to buy scrap wood and asked carpenters to make desks and stools. Teaching supplies were solved by the students paying three cents a month. When school started, the family committee organized students in the morning and afternoon classes to help each other take care of the children, and mobilized old ladies to take care of the young children, charging five cents a month. In this way, the students can study with peace of mind. In the past four years, a total of seventeen cultural learning classes have been held, and more than 400 family members have been removed from illiteracy, 67 have graduated from junior primary school, and 20 have graduated from senior primary school.
  Thrifty Savings to Run a Nursery
    There is a row of bungalows here, a total of eight small rooms, surrounded by bamboo fences, with some small tables and benches inside, but very clean. This is the nursery run by the family members. There are no small beds inside. When the children take a nap, the slabs are placed on the small tables to form a large kang. The toys are mostly dolls sewn from floral cloth by the aunts, old men made of clay, and small toys made of paper. Now, 84 children are enrolled, each paying 6.50 yuan per month, and eating one meal a day. The food is slightly better than that of ordinary working-class families. Parents pay one yuan for childcare. There are a total of eight people in the nursery, including the director, aunts, and cooks. The trade union subsidizes each staff member with five yuan per month. The aunts are all family activists. Although they have a low level of education, they have a heart that loves children and are good at learning. They have studied the "Kindergarten Teacher's Work Guide", participated in childcare training classes, visited good nurseries, and are constantly learning in life. In the summer, the rooms are hot and the children cannot sleep, so the aunts fan the children. The food expenses are not much, so the aunts are careful and economical, making sure that the food is nutritious and cheap. When Wang Ruilan's father, Wang Jiamo, came home late, the aunt took Ruilan to her own home. When Ruilan's clothes were dirty, the aunt washed them for her. When it was getting cold, the aunt sewed cotton clothes for Ruilan. Wang Jiamo often said, "I want to do more for the country to repay the aunt!" (Attached picture)

    远亲不如近邻
    ——记北蜂窝的职工家属工作
  　张渊
    北京西郊有个地方叫北蜂窝，住有一千多户北京铁路管理局的职工家属。他们组织起来分成六十七个家属小组，又选出自己爱戴的人，组成职工家属委员会和十个分会。这个职工家属组织，四年来依靠了家属群众的力量，为职工家庭解决了许多困难。
    四年多以前，北蜂窝还是一片荒凉。由这里到医院有十来二十里地，附近又没有个保健站。迁到这里来的几十户的职工家属中，有七个孕妇，她们都怕临产找不到人接生。家属委员知道了，就到附近的村子里找到学过新法接生的吴姥姥，和她约好到时候来为产妇接生。当时，北蜂窝也没个油盐店和合作社，家属们每次购粮、买菜，要跑十里八里路。家属委员会就主动和附近一个菜园子说好，把菜送到这儿来卖。还统一组织了互助购煤买粮。
    群策群力解决困难
    从1954年起，家属委员会发挥群众自己的力量来解决自己的困难。目前这儿有三个洗衣组，有三十三户参加。为单身职工洗衣服，上门取送，价钱比外边便宜。又组织了缝纫组，有十几人参加，和供应站订了合同，承做衣服。这样部分困难职工户也增加了收入。职工洗衣缝衣的问题也解决了。职工王木舟，过去一个月挣四十五元，一家九口，生活很困难，王嫂参加洗衣组后，每月收入三几十元，不但吃饱穿暖了，而且三年来买了三床新被子，买了一辆自行车，一架缝纫机，王木舟生产也带劲了。
    北蜂窝的家属们还组织互助。有个叫田兆甫的职工出差了，田大嫂产后大出血，互助组给请医生治疗，又帮助做饭，看孩子。田兆甫回来看见照顾得那么好，母子都安全，对互助组的家属说：“你们帮了我家的忙，没有让我耽误生产，也是支援了国家建设”。家属们说：“果真是远亲不如近邻”。自愿参加互助的人一天天多起来了。职工杜湿润有七个孩子，一次三个孩子同时病了，互助组给照顾两个孩子和家务，让杜嫂安心带着患肺炎的孩子去住医院，老杜也没有为此请假。目前全住宅区参加互助的已有八百九十五人，1956年互助了六千四百二十三名产妇和病人。刘子贞家里的孩子多，卫生没有搞好，互助组去了九个人帮助拆洗被褥，翻箱倒柜大扫除，老刘夫妻感动得落了泪。工人白峰泉结婚，女方要吹鼓手去迎亲，男方雇不起，家属们就组织腰鼓队一起去接新娘。结果婆家、娘家皆大欢喜。
  家属委员会还组织储金互助，动员群众自愿参加，由群众选出老实可靠的人管账。1956年参加储金互助的家属有七百零一户，有储金五千一百一十二元五角。一年里，周转了六百八十六次，其中做月子用的七十九次，治病用的三百七十七次，交学费用的九十一次，其他生活急需的一百三十九次。
    家属委员会在去年的春天，结合宣传“五好”布置各个分会注意发现培养模范家庭。在模范家庭带动下，过去家庭开支无计划的，现在做到过日子心里有数了；婆媳、夫妻闹别扭的也大大减少了。
  组织学习共同进步
    这儿的职工家属常说文化是个“宝”有了它好进步，好办事。所以从1953年就举办了识字班，去年，有四百多名家属要求学文化，家属委员会发动群众推荐老师，和动员家属知识分子自动出来当老师。找到八名教员。委员会又动员家属让出三间房子，大家动手和建筑段的工友一起把房子改成课堂。工会拿钱买废木料请木匠做桌凳。教学用品由学员每月出三角来解决。开学的时候，家属委员会组织上下午班的学员互助看孩子，动员老太太收托小娃娃，每月收费五角。这样学员们就能安心学习。四年里，共举办了十七个文化学习班，已有四百多名家属摘掉了文盲帽子，六十七名初小毕业，二十名高小毕业。
  俭俭省省办起托儿站
    这儿有一排平房，一共八小间，外面围着竹篱笆，里面简单放了一些小桌小板凳，但很干净。这是家属们办的托儿站。里面没有小床，孩子午睡的时候，就将铺板搭在小桌子上连成大炕。玩具大都是阿姨用花布缝的娃娃，用土做的老公公，用纸做的小玩意。现在收托八十四名孩子，每个托儿每月交费六元五角，每日吃一餐，伙食比一般工人家庭稍为好一点。家长负担一元保育费。托儿站的站长，阿姨，炊事员共八名，工会每月给每个工作人员补助五元。阿姨们都是家属积极分子，虽然文化程度低，但是有一颗热爱孩子们的心，又善于学习。她们学过“幼儿园教养员工作指南”，参加过保育训练班，去参观过好的托儿所，又不断地在生活中学习。夏天屋子热，孩子睡不着，阿姨就给孩子扇扇。伙食费不多阿姨就精打细算，既要有营养又要价钱便宜。孩子王瑞兰从小没有妈妈，爸爸王家模回来得晚时，阿姨就把瑞兰带到自己家里。瑞兰衣服脏了，阿姨给她洗。天要冷了，阿姨给瑞兰缝棉衣。王家模常说：“我要给国家多做事来回答阿姨”！（附图片）
