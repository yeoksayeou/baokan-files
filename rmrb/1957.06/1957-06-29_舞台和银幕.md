Stage and Screen

    "Among Comrades" Premieres
    The play "Among Comrades," written and directed by Comrade Chen Qitong, which the capital's audience has been anticipating, will be officially premiered by the General Political Department's Drama Troupe on July 1st.

    The play "Among Comrades" raises a politically significant question: how to correctly handle relationships among comrades. In this performance, actor Liang Yuru successfully portrays the vivid image of an old revolutionary cadre – Division Commander Tong Shangsheng. He is utterly loyal to the Party and dares to boldly face his shortcomings and correct his mistakes; however, due to a long period of war, he understands human relationships too simply, thus lacking good ways to treat comrades. The play also depicts another type of individualist – Qiu Yuequan – who is dizzy with victory, arrogant and boastful, considering himself superior to comrades and the masses, ignoring democracy and collective leadership, and even trying to win over or strike at others. The play reflects that comrades must treat each other with a serious attitude through the ideological and work conflicts between Tong Shangsheng and Qiu Yuequan, as well as other people.

    This is a good play worth watching. (Cheng)

    Go See the Wide-Screen Movie "Prelude to Revolution"
    The capital's wide-screen cinema is about to open. The first wide-screen film to be screened is "Prelude to Revolution." It is a Soviet feature film depicting the first Russian Revolution of 1905. The director made good use of the wide-screen's characteristics, handling the massive and broad scenes of "Bloody Sunday," the All-Russian October General Strike, and the December Armed Uprising very well. At the same time, the director did not forget to let us observe the detailed expressions of the characters through close-up shots. Here, we will see numerous characters, touching details, and the immortal image of the great Lenin. (Shi)

    Folk Artists in a Quju Opera
    In the old society, folk artists were oppressed and discriminated against.

    Zhang Henshui's novel "A Story of Marriage" depicts the tragic encounter of a female folk artist who was devastated by warlords during the feudal rule period thirty years ago. The novel once caused a sensation. Now, the Drama Team of the Beijing Folk Art Troupe has adapted it into a Quju opera based on the original work and performed it in the capital. On today's stage, the audience feels particularly close and sympathetic to folk artists who themselves use the Quju form to reflect their past suffering. (Lan)

    Puppet Show on the Silver Screen
    "Chinese Puppet Art" was filmed by the Shanghai Film Studio based on performances by the China Puppet Art Troupe. The film introduces several excellent programs of Chinese puppet shows. "Yangko Dance" and "Pigsy Carries His Bride" are rod puppet shows; "Jiang Gan Steals the Book" and "Road Fighter" are Southern Fujian puppet shows. These puppet shows, whether in character modeling, action design, or performance, are very clever and interesting, and they each have their own characteristics. (Shi)

    舞台和银幕
    “同志间”上演了
    首都观众期待着的、陈其通同志编导的“同志间”，7月1日起，由总政文工团话剧团正式公演了。
    话剧“同志间”提出了如何正确处理同志间的关系这样一个具有政治意义的问题。在这次演出中，演员梁玉儒成功地扮演了一个老革命干部的鲜明形象——童尚生师长。他对党忠心耿耿，敢于大胆地正视自己的不足而且改正缺点；然而由于长期的战争生活，使他把人与人之间的关系理解得过于简单，因此对待同志的关系缺乏良好的方式。剧中同时也描写了另一种被胜利冲昏了头脑、骄傲浮夸，自居于同志和群众之上，忽视民主和集体领导，甚至拉拢或打击别人的个人主义者——丘悦泉。这个戏就是通过童尚生和丘悦泉以及其他人们在思想上、工作上的冲突，反映出同志之间必须以严肃的态度来相处。
    这是一出值得看的好戏。（澄）
    看宽银幕电影“革命的前奏”去
    首都宽银幕电影院快要开幕了。第一次放映的宽银幕影片是“革命的前奏”。它是苏联故事片，是写1905年第一次俄国革命的。导演很好地利用了宽银幕的特点，处理了“流血星期日”、十月全俄总罢工、十二月武装起义这些巨大广阔的群众场面。同时导演也没有忘记通过特写镜头，让我们去观察人物的细部表情。在这里，我们将看到众多的人物，动人的细节，还将看到伟大列宁的不朽的形象。　（矢）
    曲剧中的曲艺艺人
    在旧社会，曲艺艺人是受压迫、受歧视的。
    张恨水的长篇小说“啼笑姻缘”就是描绘三十年前封建统治时期，一个曲艺女艺人受军阀摧残的悲惨遭遇。小说曾经轰动一时。现在，北京曲艺团戏剧队根据原著改编成曲剧，在首都演出了。在今天的舞台上，观众看到曲艺艺人自己通过曲剧形式，来反映他们本身过去这一段苦难的生活，特别感到亲切和同情。　（兰）
    木偶戏上银幕
    “中国木偶艺术”是上海电影制片厂根据中国木偶艺术剧团的演出拍摄的。影片介绍了我国木偶戏的几个优秀剧目。“秧歌舞”和“猪八戒背媳妇”是杖头木偶戏；“蒋干盗书”和“路打不平”是闽南布袋木偶戏。这些木偶戏，无论是人物造型、动作设计或是表演，都很巧妙、有趣，而且它们还各有自己的特色。　（矢）
