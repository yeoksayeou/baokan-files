    Lebanese Parliamentary Elections
    The Lebanese Parliament is a unicameral national legislative body. Members of Parliament serve a four-year term and are elected.
    The previous parliament was elected in July 1953 and had forty-four members. The number of seats in the current parliament has been increased to sixty-six. These members will be elected by province over four Sundays, starting on June 9th. Beirut and South Lebanon Province voted on June 9th, Mountainous Lebanon Province will vote on June 16th, and Bekaa Province and North Lebanon Province will vote on the 23rd and 30th, respectively.
    Among the Middle Eastern countries, Lebanon has the highest proportion of Christians, with followers of various Christian denominations accounting for more than half of the population. Therefore, the distribution of power among different religious sects is an important issue in the national life of Lebanon, and political parties do not play a very significant role in political life.
    According to agreements between the various religious sects, the president of the country (elected by parliament, term of six years) is a Christian, and the prime minister is a Muslim. The distribution of positions in government departments also has similar provisions. The parliamentary seats in this election are also allocated according to religious affiliation as follows: Christians: Maronites 20 seats, Greek Orthodox 7 seats, Greek Catholics 4 seats, Armenian Orthodox 3 seats, Armenian Catholic 1 seat. Muslims: Sunni 14 seats, Shia 12 seats, Druze area 4 seats. In addition, there is one seat for other minorities.
    The current Solh government of Lebanon was formed in November last year. Since taking office, this government has pursued a pro-Western policy that is detrimental to the national interests of Lebanon and Arab unity, and was the first to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." This policy has been criticized by the opposition "National Front" and the broad masses.
    The "National Front" has put forward slogans in the election such as pursuing a policy of active neutrality, working closely with independent Arab countries, refusing to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and any foreign aid that undermines national independence and sovereignty, and refusing to participate in the Baghdad Pact and other military blocs; at the same time, it has also accused the government of intimidating and putting pressure on voters, and demanded the postponement of the Beirut Province election, which is controlled by the government. The "National Front" organized large-scale demonstrations and strikes in Beirut and other major cities from May 30th to June 1st for this purpose. On June 2nd, the government was forced to make some concessions to the opposition, agreeing to appoint two "neutral" persons to participate in the ministerial committee overseeing the elections. The "mediator" between the government and the opposition, Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Shehab, also assured the opposition that voting would not be obstructed. Shehab also took over the command of the police. (Right)

### 黎巴嫩议会选举

　　黎巴嫩议会选举
    黎巴嫩议会是一院制的国家立法机关。议员任期四年，由选举产生。
    上届议会是在1953年7月选出的，共有议员四十四名。本届议会议员名额增加为六十六名。这些议员将在从6月9日开始的四个星期天中先后分省选出。在6月9日投票的是贝鲁特和南黎巴嫩省，山区黎巴嫩省将在6月16日投票，贝卡省和北黎巴嫩省则分别在23日和30日投票。
    在中东各国中，黎巴嫩是信奉基督教人口比率最大的国家，基督教各教派的信仰者占人口一半以上。因此，在黎巴嫩，不同教派之间的势力分配，是国家生活中的重要问题；而政党在政治生活中起的作用还不很大。
    根据各教派之间的协议，这个国家的总统（由议会选举、任期六年）由基督教徒担任，总理由穆斯林担任。政府各部门职位的分配也有类似的规定。这次选举中的议会席位，也按照宗教信仰作了如下的分配：基督教徒：马龙派二十席，希腊正教七席，希腊天主教四席，亚美尼亚正教三席，亚美尼亚天主教一席。穆斯林：逊尼派十四席，十叶派十二席，德鲁士区四席。此外，还有其他少数民族一席。
    黎巴嫩现任的索勒哈政府是在去年11月组成的。这届政府自上台以来，执行了不利于黎巴嫩民族利益和阿拉伯团结的亲西方政策，并且最先接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”。这个政策，受到反对派“民族阵线”和广大群众的指责。
    “民族阵线”在竞选中提出了奉行积极中立政策，同独立的阿拉伯国家紧密合作，拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义”以及有损国家独立和主权的任何外国援助，拒绝参加巴格达条约和其他军事集团等口号；同时，还指责政府对选民施行恫吓和施加压力，要求推迟受政府控制的贝鲁特省的选举。“民族阵线”曾为此从5月30日到6月1日，在贝鲁特等大城市组织了大规模的示威和罢工。6月2日，政府被迫向反对派作了些让步，同意任命两位“中立人士”参加监督选举的部长委员会。政府和反对派之间的“调停人”、国防部长兼陆军总司令谢哈布也向反对派保证，将使投票不受到妨碍。谢哈布并接管了警察的指挥权。  （右）
