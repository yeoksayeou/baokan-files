Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 15th: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League held an enlarged meeting and sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, requesting the Central Committee of the China Democratic League to state its attitude and position on the speeches of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and Chen Xingui, and suggested that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League convene an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee to conduct in-depth analysis and severe criticism of these speeches, and to investigate whether Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji supported Chu Anping.
    Wu Bolun, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said in his speech that a very serious problem has occurred in our League from the central to the local levels. League members and the masses are talking about it. We should immediately state our attitude: whether to follow the Communist Party, or to follow Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and Chen Xingui? Do we want socialism, or do we want capitalism to be restored in our country?
    At the meeting, sharp criticisms were also made of some anti-socialist remarks made by Wang Zunyi, a lecturer at Shaanxi Normal University and a member of the China Democratic League.
    At the request of the League members, nine members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League in Xi'an held a meeting this morning. Li Zijian, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the fallacies of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are not accidental. He said that he remembered that at a working conference of the entire League in the past, Luo Longji said that the democratic parties were "icing on the cake, adding fuel to the fire, and acting as thugs..." for the Communist Party.

　　陕西盟员要求民盟中央检查
　　章伯钧是否支持了储安平？
    据新华社西安15日电　民盟陕西省委员会和西安市委员会举行扩大会议，向盟中央发出电报，要求民盟中央对章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平、陈新桂等的言论表明态度和立场，并且建议民盟中央召开常委会扩大会议对这些言论进行深入分析，严加批判，并检查章伯钧、罗隆基对储安平有无支持情事。
    民盟西安市委员会副主任委员武伯伦发言说，我们盟内从中央到地方现在发生了十分严重的问题，盟员和群众议论纷纷，我们应该立即表明态度，是跟共产党走呢，还是跟章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平、陈新桂走？是要社会主义，还是要资本主义在我国复辟？
    会上对陕西师范学院讲师、民盟盟员王尊一的一些反社会主义的言论也进行了尖锐的批评。
    在盟员们的纷纷要求下，在西安的九位民盟中央委员和候补委员在今天上午召开了会议。民盟中央委员李子健说，章伯钧、罗隆基的谬论并不是偶然的。他说，记得过去在一次全盟的工作会议上，罗隆基就说过民主党派对共产党来说是“锦上添花、火上加油，作了打手……”。
