　　Discussing the Han Opera "Er Du Mei"
　　Mei Lanfang

　　Han Opera is an old opera genre with a long history and deep traditions. This time, the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe came to Beijing to give a report-back performance, bringing many excellent plays, performed by excellent actors, which will surely satisfy the audience.

　　This spring, when I was performing in Wuhan, the comrades of the Han Opera Troupe talked to me about the plan to excavate and reorganize "Er Du Mei." They started this reorganization work after the repertoire work conference. In the past, the entire "Er Du Mei" performed by Han Opera would take two or three evenings to complete. Many scenes were simply narrative, which felt protracted and lengthy. In fact, the most popular scenes with the audience were only the single scenes like "Scolding the Prime Minister," "Chongtai" (also written as "Congtai"), "Saving from the Rock," "Fallen Garden," and "Lost Hairpin." The entire "Er Du Mei" performed by the Han Opera Troupe now strings together the above five scenes. In addition, there is a wonderful scene called "Fishing Boat Match," which narrates another marriage encounter of Chen Xingyuan's younger brother, Chen Chunsheng, but it is not related to the main thread of Chen Xingyuan and Mei Liangyu. Therefore, it is not included in the entire "Er Du Mei," just like the wonderful scenes of "Male Prison" and "Female Prison" in the old version of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," which had to be cut and deleted in the reorganized and adapted script, but can still exist independently. I agreed with their approach at the time. I told them: Regarding the repertoire of "Er Du Mei," in Peking Opera, I only performed "Fallen Garden" in my childhood. At the same time, I watched several predecessors, such as Mr. Chen Delin, perform "Fallen Garden." According to my friends, there is also a complete "Er Du Mei" script in Peking Opera, which also includes "Scolding the Prime Minister," "Chongtai," "Fallen Garden," and "Lost Golden Hairpin"... and there is also a "Fishing Boat Match," which is roughly the same as the Han Opera version. However, I haven't seen this script, nor have I seen these repertoires being performed. Therefore, I can't offer any specific opinions.

　　At that time, Comrade Chen Bohua said to me: In Han Opera, "Scolding the Prime Minister," "Chongtai," and "Fallen Garden" are all singing-focused plays. "Scolding the Prime Minister" is Xipi Duozi (fast sanyan), "Chongtai" enters with Xipi Manban, the "Giving Hairpin" section is Xipi Duozi, and the "Chongtai" scene used to take an hour and a half to perform, but now it has been compressed to one hour. "Fallen Garden" is first Fan Erhuang, then changed to Xipi Eight-Fan Screen. The Eight-Fan Screen is eight different arias, also known as Nine Tones and Eighteen Beats, which is very complex and not easy to sing. She is currently studying these arias with the old masters.

　　I said to her: "The scenes and tempo of 'Fallen Garden' in Peking Opera are basically similar to those in Han Opera. Peking Opera also first sings Fan Erhuang, then changes to Xipi. It is a Qingyi Zheng Gong play, and it is impossible to excel without a good voice. Your voice is very suitable for singing this kind of play, but the singing should be processed as much as possible based on the tradition of Han Opera. The good things left by the predecessors should be inherited and developed with great care." After we parted in Wuhan, I heard that the Han Opera "Er Du Mei" was welcomed everywhere. It can be seen that the Han Opera Troupe's attitude towards excavating and reorganizing traditional repertoires is prudent and careful, so it can be loved by the masses. Precisely because of this, I am talking about the play "Er Du Mei" first, as an introduction to the Beijing audience.

　　Also, the famous actors who came with the troupe this time all have their own signature plays. For example, the Sheng actors Comrades Hu Guilin and Zhou Tiandong's "Weiyang Palace," "Cooking Kuai Che," "Qiao Mansion Seeks a Plan," "Xing Han Tu," etc., and the clown actor Comrade Li Luoke's "Guangping Prefecture," "Going Down the Mountain," "Flower Drum," etc., are all very popular. I will not go into detail here.

### 谈汉剧“二度梅”

　　谈汉剧“二度梅”
　　梅兰芳
    汉剧是历史悠久、传统深厚的老剧种，武汉市汉剧团这次来北京汇报演出，带来了许多好戏，这些好戏并且由好角色来表演，看了是能够使观众满意的。
    今年春间我在武汉市演出时，汉剧团的同志们曾经和我谈起挖掘、整理“二度梅”的计划。他们是在剧目工作会议以后就进行了这个整理工作，从前汉剧所演的全部“二度梅”，要用两三个晚会的时间才能演完，其中有不少场子只是铺叙故事，感到拖沓冗长，事实上最受观众欢迎的只有“骂相”、“重台”（一作“丛台”）、“舍岩”、“落园”、“失钗”等单折戏，现在汉剧团演出的全部“二度梅”，即以上述五折贯串而成。另外还有一折精彩的“渔舟配”，是叙述陈杏元之弟陈春生另一段姻缘遇合，但与陈杏元、梅良玉这一主要线索无关，所以未列入全部“二度梅”之内，正像老本“十五贯”当中精彩的两折“男监”、“女监”在整理、改编的剧本内不得不割爱删掉而仍可使其独立存在一样。我当时很同意他们的做法，我告诉他们：“二度梅”的剧目，在京剧里我幼年只演过“落花园”，同时我看过几位前辈如陈德霖先生等演的也是“落花园”，据我的朋友告诉我，京剧也有全本“二度梅”的剧本，其中也包括“骂相”、“重台”、“落花园”、“失金钗”……并且也有一出“鱼舟配”，与汉剧大致相同，可是这个剧本我没有看到，而这些剧目的演出也没有看到。因此，提不出什么具体的意见。
    当时陈伯华同志对我说：汉剧里的“骂相”、“重台”、“落花园”，都是唱工戏。“骂相”是西皮垛子（快三眼），“重台”出场是西皮慢板，“赠钗”一段是西皮垛子，“重台”这一折戏从前要演一个半钟头，现在压缩为一小时，“落花园”前面是反二簧，后面改西皮八扇屏，八扇屏就是八句不同的唱腔，又叫做九腔十八板，很复杂，不容易唱，她正在向老先生们钻研这些唱腔。
    我对她说：“京剧‘落花园’的场子和板调基本上与汉调差不多，京剧也是先唱反二簧，后改西皮，是青衣正工戏，没有嗓子是无法见长的。你的嗓子唱这种戏非常对工，不过唱腔要尽量从汉剧传统的基础上来加工，前辈留下的好东西，要很珍贵地继承下来，加以发展。”我们在武汉分手以后，听说汉剧“二度梅”在各地都受到欢迎，可以想到，汉剧团对挖掘、整理传统剧目的工作态度，是审慎而仔细的，因此能够得到群众的喜爱。也就是因为这样，所以我把“二度梅”这个戏首先谈一下，作为向北京观众的介绍。
    还有这次同来的名演员们都有每个人的拿手好戏。如：生行胡桂林、周天栋两同志的“未央宫”、“烹蒯彻”、“乔府求计”、“兴汉图”等戏，丑角李罗克同志的“广平府”、“下山”、“花鼓”等戏，都是脍炙人口的，这里就不细谈了。
