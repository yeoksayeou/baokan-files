Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 10th. The plenary session of the World Peace Council, the first to be held in Asia, opened here this morning. Approximately five hundred delegates from sixty-three countries gathered in the hall of the Colombo Oriental Hotel. The hall was decorated with blue and white paper flowers called "Wave Bridges," traditionally used by the Sinhalese to symbolize bridges of friendship and peace.
　　
After the Deputy Chairman of the World Peace Council, D’Astier de la Vigerie, Secretary-General of the French Progressive Republican Union, announced the opening of the meeting, a letter from the Chairman of the Council, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, was read. Joliot-Curie did not attend the meeting due to health conditions that made long-distance travel unsuitable. In his letter, he pointed out that the issue of disarmament, especially the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, is one of the primary issues to be discussed at this meeting.
　　
The head of the Ceylon delegation, Ceylon's Minister of Justice, Mr. Silva, was elected chairman of the meeting amidst warm applause. He delivered the opening speech to the meeting.
　　
In pointing out the significance of the World Peace Council holding this meeting in Asia, he said that the people of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, who have been oppressed, constitute the overwhelming majority of mankind. They have either already shaken off or are in the process of shaking off the shackles of colonialism, and their opinions and interests can no longer be ignored. He said: "They constitute a powerful moral and practical force for peace."
　　
The leader of the Ceylon Peace Movement said: "The historically significant Bandung Conference has clearly demonstrated this. All forces in Europe and the West that wholeheartedly support peace will now recognize that the newly liberated people of Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world are their powerful allies."
　　
Colombo Mayor Sugathadasa delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the citizens of Colombo. He told the delegates that the Colombo Municipal Council had recently unanimously passed a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing and welcoming the holding of the Peace Council meeting in Colombo. He also said, "I assure you that, regardless of race, religion, language, and political belief, we are deeply concerned about the serious problems facing the world and the threats to peace involved in these problems. Peace is indivisible, and for this reason alone, the aims of the World Peace Council are acceptable to all of us."
　　
The meeting this morning also read a congratulatory letter from the Prime Minister of Ceylon, Bandaranaike, to this meeting of the World Peace Council. In his letter, the Prime Minister of Ceylon expressed his belief that if everyone considered issues from the perspective of humanity rather than from the perspective of individuals or individual units, "perhaps we would have already crossed the danger point, and perhaps people would have had the opportunity to obtain a stable new society and a new civilization."
　　
The Prime Minister of Ceylon said, "Today we are living between two worlds, one dying and the other struggling to be born. We are living in an era of transition from one civilization to another." "During the transitional period between two civilizations, instability, conflict, and disagreements naturally occur, but in the history of the world, there has never been such a large-scale ideological, political, economic, social, and national conflict as exists today. At the same time, the methods used in the past to resolve these differences—war—seem unimaginable today due to the terrible weapons that mankind has recently invented and developed."
　　
"Therefore, the most urgent need is to expand the atmosphere of peace as much as possible, to resolve differences through negotiation rather than force, and to promote international understanding and friendship."
　　
Bandaranaike concluded by saying, "The problem we all face today is to recognize these differences so that they can be reconciled with the supreme need for mutual understanding and cooperation, even if signing common agreements is not yet possible. We must live ourselves and let others live."
　　
Bandaranaike's letter was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause as it was read.
　　
Other letters read today included a congratulatory letter from Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk, who expressed his hope that "the actions of all friends of peace will eliminate the dangers of conflict that are forming in various major regions of the world, and that the leaders concerned will abide by the spirit of the teachings of Buddha in order to achieve mutual understanding and abandon the spirit of distrust that is causing the current tensions."
　　
At this morning's meeting, Council Vice-Chairman D’Astier de la Vigerie gave a report on the international situation, the activities of the World Peace Council, and the future of the peace movement.
　　
Also speaking at the meeting were Council Vice-Chairman Dr. Kitchlew and Professor Yasui Iku, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, among others.
　　
The plenary session of the World Peace Council will be divided into subcommittees tomorrow to discuss various issues.

　　六十三国和平代表聚集科伦坡
　　世界和平理事会全体会议开幕
    新华社科伦坡10日电  第一次在亚洲举行的世界和平理事会全体会议今天上午在这里开幕。在科伦坡东方大饭店的大厅中，聚集了来自六十三个国家的五百位左右代表。大厅中装饰着僧伽罗人在传统上用来象征友谊及和平之桥的叫作“波浪之桥”的蓝、白两色纸花。
    在世界和平理事会副主席、法国进步共和联盟总书记达斯迪埃—德拉维热里宣布会议开幕以后，会上宣读了理事会主席约里奥—居里的来信。约里奥—居里由于健康状况不适宜作长途旅行，没有出席这次会议。他在信中指出，裁军问题，特别是禁止原子核武器试验问题，是这次会议讨论的首要问题之一。
    锡兰代表团团长、锡兰司法部长席尔瓦在热烈的掌声中被推举为会议的主席，他向会议致了开幕词。
    他在指出世界和平理事会这次在亚洲召开会议的意义时说，亚洲、非洲、中东和拉丁美洲被压迫国家的人民构成了人类的压倒多数，它们已经或者正在摆脱殖民主义的羁绊，他们的意见和利益是再也不能被忽视了。他说：“他们组成了一支拥护和平的有力的道义和实际力量”。
    这位锡兰和平运动领袖说：“有历史意义的万隆会议已经清楚地说明了这一点。欧洲和西方的一切衷心拥护和平的力量现在将认识到，亚洲、非洲和世界其他部分的新近获得自由的各国人民是他们的强有力的盟友。”
    科伦坡市长苏加塔达萨代表科伦坡市民致欢迎词。他告诉代表们说，不久前科伦坡市政委员会一致通过了决议，呼吁立即停止原子核武器试验，并且欢迎和平理事会会议在科伦坡举行。他又说，“我向你们保证，不分种族、宗教、语言和政治信仰，我们都深切关怀着世界所遭遇到的严重问题以及这些问题所牵涉到的对和平的威胁。和平是不可分割的，仅仅由于这个原因，世界和平理事会的目的是我们所有的人都能够接受的”。
    今天上午的会议还宣读了锡兰总理班达拉奈克致世界和平理事会这次会议的贺信。锡兰总理在信中表示相信，如果所有的人们都是从人类而不是从个人或者是各个单位出发来考虑问题的话，“也许就已经越过了危险点，而且也许人们已经有了获得一个稳定的新社会和新文明的机会了。”
    锡兰总理说，“我们今天正生活在两个世界之间，一个正在死去，而另一个正在挣扎着诞生下来。我们今天正生活在从一种文明过渡到另一种文明的年代里”。“在两种文明之间的过渡时期，很自然地发生不稳定、冲突和各种不同意见的分歧，但是在世界历史上还从来没有发生过像今天所存在的这样大规模的意识形态上、政治上、经济上、社会上和民族上等等的冲突。同时，过去解决这些分歧所采用的办法——战争，在今天看来由于人类最近所发明并且发展了的可怕的武器而变得不可想像了”。
    “因此，最迫切需要的是尽可能地扩大和平气氛，用谈判而不是用武力来解决分歧，并且促进国际谅解和友谊”。
    班达拉奈克最后说，“今天，我们大家所面临的问题是承认这些分歧，以便使这些分歧同互相谅解和合作的最高需要调和起来，即使签订共同协定还不可能。我们必须自己活，也让人家活。”
    班达拉奈克的信在宣读的时候不断为热烈的掌声所打断。
    在今天宣读的其他信件中有柬埔寨首相西哈努克的贺信，他表示希望，“所有的和平的朋友们的行动将会消除正在世界各个主要地区形成的冲突的危险，有关领袖将遵守释迦牟尼教义的精神，以达到相互谅解和抛弃引起目前紧张局势的不信任的精神。”
    在今天上午的会议上，理事会副主席达斯迪埃—德拉维热里就国际局势、世界和平理事会的活动和和平运动的前途作了报告。
    在会上发言的还有理事会副主席克其鲁博士和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁教授等人。
    世界和平理事会全体会议将在明天分成小组委员会，讨论各项问题。
