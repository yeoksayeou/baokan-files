    Railway Built to Pingdingshan
    According to People's Railway News, the railway branch line leading to the Pingdingshan Coal Mine has been basically completed. This railway branches off from the Beijing-Hankou Railway at Mengmiao Station, crosses the Ru River, and extends to the Pingdingshan mining area, which is under intense construction. It is nearly 85 kilometers long, including the dedicated lines in the mining area. So far, except for the Ru River Bridge and some water supply projects, the main construction of the entire line has been completed, and some goods have begun to be transported.
    The completion of this branch line plays an important role in accelerating the construction of the Pingdingshan Coal Mine and supporting the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company with coal.

    铁路修到平顶山
    据人民铁道讯  通往平顶山煤矿的铁路支线，已经基本建成。这条铁路由京汉线孟庙站出岔，跨过汝河，伸向正在紧张兴建的平顶山矿区，包括矿区专用线全长近八十五公里。到目前为止，全线除汝河大桥和部分给水工程外，其他主体工程已经完成，并开始运送一部分货物。
    这条支线的建成，对加速平顶山煤矿的建设和支援武汉钢铁公司用煤起着重要作用。
