　　Xinhua News Agency, Naha, 21st: Naha dispatch: The mayor of Naha, Okinawa Island, Kamejiro Senaga, announced on June 20th that he will continue to govern until a new city council is elected in September.

　　The Naha City Council, manipulated by the United States, passed a vote of no confidence in Senaga on June 17th. Senaga did not resign; instead, he dissolved the city council, which was dominated by conservative forces.

　　Senaga told city government officials yesterday that he hopes to obtain a vote of approval from the new city council, and he will only resign if the new city council wants to remove him from office.

　　Senaga is the Secretary-General of the Okinawa People's Party. Because this party implements a policy of firmly opposing the continued occupation of Okinawa by the United States, Senaga has become a thorn in the side of the United States, which has been trying to remove him from power.

    新华社21日讯　那霸消息：冲绳岛首府那霸市长濑长龟次郎6月20日宣布，在新的市议会在9月间选出以前，他将继续执政。
    在美国操纵下的那霸市议会曾经在6月17日通过对濑长的不信任案，濑长没有辞职，他解散了保守势力占优势的市议会。
    濑长昨天对市政府的官员们说，他希望能够获得新的市议会的赞成票，假如新市议会要罢免他，他才辞职。
    濑长是冲绳人民党的书记长，由于这个党执行坚决反对美国继续占领冲绳的政策，濑长便成了美国的眼中之钉，美国一直想赶他下台。
