Soviet Union Stipulates New University Enrollment Rules
Give Priority to Enrolling Students with Excellent Grades and Two Years of Work Experience

(Reported by this newspaper) The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education recently approved new rules for university enrollment in 1957. Minister Yelyutin said that the new rules stipulate that universities (excluding correspondence schools and night schools) will first enroll those who have performed well in the entrance examinations, have worked in the national economy or cultural departments for more than two years, and have performed well in their work. Demobilized soldiers and those who participated in the Great Patriotic War also enjoy priority in enrollment.

Those who have won gold medals and have more than two years of work experience can be exempted from the entrance examination upon application; those who have won silver medals and outstanding students from secondary specialized schools, and who have more than two years of work experience, only need to take one subject with excellent results.

An important provision in the new rules is that each subject of the entrance examination will be conducted by the admissions committee (i.e., with at least two examiners participating).

    苏联规定大学招生新则
    尽先录取考绩优良和已有两年工龄的学生
    本报讯　苏联高教部最近批准了1957年高等学校招生新规则。叶留金部长说，新规则中规定，高等学校（不包括函授学校和夜校）将首先录取那些在入学考试中成绩良好、已在国民经济部门或文化部门工作两年以上并且在工作中表现良好的人。复员军人和参加过伟大卫国战争的人也享有优先录取的权利。
    获得金质奖章并有两年以上工龄的人，可以根据申请免除入学考试；获得银质奖章和中等专业学校的优等生，并且有两年以上工龄的人，只考一门任何成绩优良的科目。
    新规则里一个重要的规定就是，招生考试的每一科目都由招生委员会（即至少有两个主考人参加）来进行。
