    Many Countries Value British Relaxation of Trade Restrictions with China
    Loopholes in American "Embargo" Policy Grow Larger
    Paris "Embargo" Body Meets
    Majority Support British Government Action
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 1st: The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) held an executive committee meeting on May 31st to discuss the British announcement of unilateral relaxation of trade restrictions. Sources say that the majority of countries attending expressed "support" for the British government's decision.
    Sources say that the committee is currently trying to establish a set of "new regulations" to replace the "old regulations" that collapsed as a result of the British decision. Other member states of the committee hope that the new regulations can gain the "support" of the United States, in order to avoid a "rift" with the United States on the issue of trade with China.
    Well-informed sources say that the "new regulations" will be based on a quota system, and the committee will hold a meeting on the 4th to study this issue.
    A spokesman for the British Board of Trade said on May 31 that although Britain has adopted the practice of relaxing trade restrictions with China, it does not intend to withdraw from this "embargo" committee. He said that Britain will ask the committee to help formulate new trade controls that Britain will adopt independently on the issue of trade with China.

    巴黎“禁运”机构开会
    多数支持英国政府的行动
    新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：对华贸易“禁运”委员会5月31日召开执行委员会讨论英国宣布单独放宽贸易限制的问题。消息说，与会的大多数国家都对英国政府的这一决定表示“支持”。
    有消息说，这个委员会目前正在设法建立一套“新规定”来代替由于英国这一决定而垮了台的“旧规定”。委员会的其他成员国希望这个新规定能获得美国的“支持”，以避免同美国在对中国贸易问题上产生“裂痕”。
    消息灵通人士说，“新规定”将以定额制度为基础，委员会将在4日举行会议研究这个问题。
    英国贸易部发言人在5月31日表示，英国虽然采取了放宽对中国贸易限制的做法，但它不打算脱离这个“禁运”委员会。他说，英国将要求这个委员会来帮助拟订英国在对华贸易问题上单独采取的新的贸易管制。
