　　The General Trend, Unwilling to Abandon Itself
    Japan Decides to Relax the Embargo on China
    Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: According to Kyodo News, Japanese government officials announced today that the Japanese government has decided, starting July 1st, to relax the "embargo" on China to the same level as that applied to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries.

    Government officials also said that the Japanese government is currently making preparations for this.

    According to a report by UPI reporter Hans Lay, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who is currently visiting the United States, told US government leaders that his government would soon relax the "embargo" on China to the same level as that applied to the Soviet Union. However, he also assured Eisenhower that Japan would be very careful to avoid transporting "strategic materials" to China.

    It is reported that Kishi explained to Eisenhower that Japan would probably not go as far as Britain in reducing restrictions on trade with China; however, he pointed out that most countries participating in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which regulates trade with China, are now prepared to support Britain. He said that therefore, Japan, as an important trading nation, must take action. According to the communiqué issued by Kishi and Eisenhower after their talks, Eisenhower emphasized the need for Japan to continue controlling the export of "strategic materials" during the talks. Hans Lay believes that Kishi and Eisenhower have different views on Japan's trade with China.

　　大势所趋　不愿自弃
    日本决定放宽对华禁运
    新华社23日讯　据共同社报道，日本政府官员今天宣布，日本政府已经决定从7月1日起，把对中国的“禁运”放宽到同对苏联和东欧社会主义国家所实行的水平。
    政府官员并且说，现在日本政府正在为此进行准备工作。
    据合众社记者汉斯莱报道，正在美国访问的日本首相岸信介曾经向美国政府首脑表示，他的政府要在最近把对中国的“禁运”放宽到同对苏联实行的同样水平。但是，他又向艾森豪威尔保证，日本将十分小心地避免把“战略物资”运送到中国。
    据报道，岸信介曾经向艾森豪威尔解释说，日本在降低对华贸易的限制方面，大概不会做到英国所做到的程度；然而他指出，参加管制对中国贸易的巴黎统筹委员会的大部分国家现在已经准备支持英国了。他说，因此，作为一个重要贸易国家的日本必须采取行动。根据岸信介同艾森豪威尔在会谈后发表的公报，艾森豪威尔在会谈中强调了日本继续管制“战略物资”出口的必要。汉斯莱认为，岸信介同艾森豪威尔在日本对中国贸易问题上抱有不同的看法。
