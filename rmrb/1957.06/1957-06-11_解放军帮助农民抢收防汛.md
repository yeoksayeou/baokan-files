Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Under the slogan of "Supporting Farmers to Strive for a Bumper Harvest," the broad masses of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively participating in various seasonal agricultural labors. Recently, continuous rain in the Fujian and Guangdong areas has prompted local PLA units to dispatch large numbers of personnel to help local farmers with harvesting and flood prevention. A certain unit stationed on an island in Fujian helped farmers harvest more than 1,300 mu of wheat and beans in the midst of strong winds and rain. A unit stationed in a forward position outside the Minjiang River estuary helped agricultural cooperatives harvest all the wheat on the island in three days. All officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the Guangzhou area, along with some family members, have been helping farmers on Huangpu Island in the Pearl River with flood prevention, repairing 22 dangerous sections of the embankment over the past few days. A certain unit stationed in Zhangpu area of Fujian also cooperated with the local people to complete the seawall reinforcement project before the flood season.

At the foot of Cangshan Mountain and along the coast of Erhai Lake in the Yunnan border region, PLA officers and soldiers are spending a tense wheat harvesting season together with the local people of all ethnic groups. Every day, large teams of officers and soldiers go to agricultural cooperatives to participate in harvesting labor. Some units stationed in Baoshan even carry backpacks and cooking utensils, traveling dozens of miles to various villages to help with work. The troops stationed in Bishan, Jiangjin, and other areas of Sichuan have currently helped with the harvesting of most of the local wheat, ensuring that farmers can promptly transition to rice transplanting. In addition, PLA units in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have also successively engaged in activities to help farmers with wheat harvesting.

Many units stationed in relatively arid areas are currently assisting local governments and people in carrying out drought resistance and prevention activities.

　　解放军帮助农民抢收防汛
    据新华社10日讯  中国人民解放军广大部队在“支援农民争取大丰收”的口号下，积极参加各种季节性农业劳动。近日福建、广东地区阴雨连绵，当地解放军部队抽出大批人力帮助当地农民抢收、防汛。驻守福建某岛部队在狂风暴雨中帮助农民收割小麦、豆子一千三百多亩。驻闽江口外一个前哨地区的部队，在三天中替农业社抢收了岛上的全部小麦。驻广州地区某部全体官兵和一部分家属，连日帮助珠江黄埔岛上的农民防汛，抢修了危险堤段二十二处。驻福建漳浦地区的某部也配合当地人民在汛期前完成了海堤加固工程。
    在云南边疆的苍山脚下、洱海岸旁，解放军官兵和当地各族人民共度着紧张的麦收季节。每天都有大队官兵到农业社去参加收割劳动。驻在保山的某些部队甚至背着背包、炊具，不远数十里到各村庄去帮工。在四川璧山、江津等地区的驻军，目前已帮助抢收了当地的大部小麦，可以保证农民们及时地转入插秧。此外，在山东、河南、安徽和江、浙等省的解放军部队，也先后投入了帮助农民麦收的活动。
    许多驻在比较干旱的地区的部队，目前正帮助当地政府和人民展开抗旱、防旱活动。
