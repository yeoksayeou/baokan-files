　　China's First Modern Commutator Brush Factory
　　Harbin Commutator Brush Factory Trials Products
　　Xinping'an Mine, with Annual Output of 1.5 Million Tons of Coal, Transferred to Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th -- China's first modern commutator brush factory -- the Harbin Commutator Brush Factory -- has been basically completed and has begun trial production; the first batch of commutator brush semi-finished products have recently been trial-produced. This year, the trial production workshop will trial-produce more than ten types of non-ferrous and ferrous commutator brushes.
    The Harbin Commutator Brush Factory is one of the key projects of the First Five-Year Plan, and construction began in June 1954. This factory will use very cheap materials such as graphite, charcoal, coke, and coal tar to manufacture commutator brushes and other carbon products.
    Commutator brushes are parts needed for various generators and electric machinery such as trams and cranes, and are used as conductors of current. Carbon products have even wider applications. Vibration diaphragms in telephones, carbon anodes in radio vacuum tubes, arc lamps used for filming movies, arc rods used for projecting movies, etc., are all carbon products. In the past, China did not have a factory specializing in the production of commutator brushes, and the commutator brushes needed were all imported from foreign countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 13th -- The Xinping'an vertical shaft, a modern vertical shaft with a designed annual output of 1.5 million tons, newly built by the Fuxin Coal Mine, has been completed and transferred to production on the 11th. This is the largest of the new mine shafts built during China's First Five-Year Plan that have already been put into production. This vertical shaft has been named "Xinping'an Mine."
    The Ping'an vertical shaft was designed by the Soviet Union and constructed under the guidance of Soviet experts.

　　我国第一座现代化电刷制造厂
　　哈尔滨电刷厂试制产品
　　年产一百五十万吨煤的新平安矿移交生产
    新华社哈尔滨14日电　我国第一座现代化的电刷制造厂——哈尔滨电刷厂已经基本建成，并且开始试制产品；第一批电刷的半成品最近已经试制出来。今年，试制车间将试制出十多种有色和黑色电刷。
    哈尔滨电刷厂是第一个五年计划的重点工程之一，1954年6月开工兴建。这个厂将利用很便宜的石墨、木炭、焦炭、煤焦油等材料，制造电刷和其他炭素产品。
    电刷是各种发电机和电车、起重机等电动机械上所需要的部件，利用它来作为电流的导电体。炭素产品的用途更广。电话机上的震动膜，无线电真空管里的炭素阳极，拍电影用的弧光灯，放映电影用的弧光棒等，都是炭素制品。过去，我国没有一个专门生产电刷的工厂，需要的电刷都是依靠国外进口。
    据新华社阜新13日电　阜新煤矿新建的一座设计年产量达一百五十万吨的现代化竖井——平安竖井，已经建成并在11日移交生产。这是我国第一个五年计划新建的矿井中，已经投入生产的最大的一座。这座竖井已经被命名为“新平安矿”。
    平安竖井是由苏联设计并且在苏联专家的指导下进行建设的。
