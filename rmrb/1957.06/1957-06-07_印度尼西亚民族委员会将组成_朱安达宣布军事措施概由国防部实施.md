The Indonesian Ministry of Defense announced today that Prime Minister Juanda, in his capacity as Minister of Defense and holder of supreme military power, announced yesterday that in order to enable the chiefs of staff of the three armed forces to coordinate with each other in issuing various regulations, all measures related to military power will be implemented centrally within the scope of the Ministry of Defense from now on. Previously, the chiefs of staff of the three armed forces issued various regulations related to the implementation of martial law within their respective systems.

The Minister of Defense announced the above measures at a working meeting of the Ministry of Defense yesterday. The chiefs of staff of the Navy and Air Force and representatives of the Army Chief of Staff attended the meeting. The Army Chief of Staff is currently in Sulawesi.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 6th. According to a report in today's "Social Messenger" in Jakarta, the Indonesian government recently expelled three Dutch nationals. These people are believed to have participated in subversive activities aimed at disrupting and overthrowing the Republic of Indonesia.

The three Dutch nationals are Van Genst, head of the Southeast Trading Company in Jakarta, Mollema, an employee of Eagle Airlines, and Van Gewen, an employee of the Bandung Prosecutor's Office. Van Genst and Van Gewen are members of the Rongslag and Schmidt conspiracy group.

The trial of the ringleaders of this group by the Indonesian government has proved that Dutch imperialists are doing everything possible to carry out subversive activities in an attempt to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia.
