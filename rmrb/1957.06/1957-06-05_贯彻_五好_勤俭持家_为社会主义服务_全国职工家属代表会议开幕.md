Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. The first national conference of 职工家属 representatives in our country's history opened in Beijing today. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his opening speech that the main task of this conference is to summarize and exchange the experiences of 职工家属 work in recent years, so as to further develop 职工家属 work throughout the country and enable it to play a greater role in the future socialist construction.

More than 1,300 职工家属 representatives from all over the country are attending the meeting, more than 90% of whom are outstanding individuals who have received various awards. Among them are 职工家属 who bravely participated in the workers' movement before liberation; thrifty housewives who manage their households diligently; good mothers who conscientiously educate their children; enthusiastic family activists who serve the masses; as well as model caregivers and model teachers from family nurseries and cultural schools, and learning models, hygiene models, etc.

Liao Caide, the mother of Deng Zhongxia, a famous leader of the early workers' movement in our country, also attended the conference today and was warmly welcomed and respected by the representatives.

After announcing the opening of the conference, Lai Ruoyu first extended cordial greetings and respect to all 职工家属 on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and all employees. He said that the working class is the leading class of the motherland and the main force in building socialism. Their labor is to build a happy and fulfilling new life for themselves and the people of the whole country. However, without the cooperation and collaboration of 职工家属 in managing household affairs, it is impossible for the working class to work and produce with peace of mind. Therefore, the household labor of 职工家属 is also glorious and important in the cause of socialist construction.

Lai Ruoyu said that every family member should manage their household well and support national construction with the spirit of thrift. Among family members and neighbors, there should be harmony, unity, mutual help, and mutual respect. 职工家属 should also raise their awareness, care about national affairs, understand the situation and difficulties of socialist construction, and recognize their responsibilities in the cause of socialist construction; at the same time, they must rely on their own strength, promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and find ways to overcome various difficulties.

Lai Ruoyu demanded that every employee should respect the household labor of their family members, and care for, love, and help them. He said that employees and their family members are not only relatives but also comrades who are jointly building a new socialist life.

After Lai Ruoyu delivered the opening speech, Yang Zhihua, Minister of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report entitled "Build the Country Thriftily, Run the Household Thriftily, and Contribute More to Socialist Construction." After explaining in detail how 职工家属 should support socialist construction, she said that, according to the requirements of the state and the experience of work in recent years, the basic tasks of the current national 职工家属 work are: to educate 职工家属 to raise their awareness, strengthen unity, implement the "Five Goods," and serve socialism. The "Five Goods" mean: good at running the household thriftily, good at unity and mutual assistance, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, and good at studying hard.

Yang Zhihua said that among the "Five Goods," we should focus on running the household thriftily. Because running the household thriftily is not only a requirement for managing household affairs well, but also a requirement for building the country thriftily.

During the break of the conference, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Changsheng and Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairmen, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Deng Yingchao and Li Dequan, Vice Chairmen, and others, respectively met with some of the representatives and had cordial conversations with them.

    贯彻“五好”勤俭持家　为社会主义服务
    全国职工家属代表会议开幕
    新华社4日讯　我国历史上第一次全国性的职工家属代表会议，今天在北京开幕。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在开幕词中说，这次会议的主要任务，是总结和交流几年来职工家属工作的经验，以便在全国进一步把家属工作开展起来，使之在今后的社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
    参加会议的，有来自全国各地的一千三百多名职工家属代表，她们90％以上是得过各种奖励的优秀人物。其中有在解放前就勇敢地参加工人运动的职工家属；有勤俭操持家务的家庭主妇；有认真教养子女的好母亲；有热心为群众服务的家属积极分子；也有家属托儿站和文化学校的模范教养员、模范教师，以及学习模范、卫生模范等。
    我国著名的早期工人运动领袖邓中夏烈士的母亲——廖彩德，今天也出席了大会，受到代表们热烈欢迎和尊敬。
    大会在宣布开幕以后，赖若愚首先代表中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和全国职工，向全体职工家属致以亲切的慰问和敬意。他说，工人阶级是祖国的领导阶级，是建设社会主义的主力军。他们的劳动是为了给自己和全国人民建设幸福美满的新生活。可是工人阶级要是没有职工家属操劳家务的配合和协作，是不可能安心劳动生产的。所以，职工家属的家务劳动，在社会主义建设事业中也同样是光荣和重要的。
    赖若愚说，每个家属都应当把家务搞好，用勤俭持家的精神来支援国家建设。在一家老少之间和邻里之间，要和睦、要团结，要互相帮助和互相尊敬。职工家属还要提高觉悟，关心国家大事，了解社会主义建设的情况和困难，认清自己在社会主义建设事业中的责任；同时要靠自己的力量，发扬团结互助的精神，想办法来克服各种困难。
    赖若愚要求每一个职工应该尊重家属的家务劳动，体贴、爱护和帮助她们。他说，职工和自己的家属不仅是亲人关系，而且是共同建设社会主义新生活的同志关系。
    在赖若愚致开幕词以后，中华全国总工会女工部部长杨之华作了题为“勤俭建国、勤俭持家，为社会主义建设贡献更大力量”的报告。她在详细说明了职工家属应该怎样支援社会主义建设的问题以后说，根据国家的要求和几年来工作的经验，当前全国职工家属工作的基本任务是：教育职工家属提高觉悟，加强团结，贯彻“五好”，为社会主义服务。“五好”就是要做到：勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养子女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好。
    杨之华说，在“五好”中，又应该以勤俭持家为中心。因为勤俭持家不仅是搞好家务的要求，也是勤俭建国的要求。
    大会休息期间，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、副主席刘长胜、朱学范，中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，副主席邓颖超、李德全等，分别接见了一部分代表，并且同她们亲切地谈了话。
    大会还接受了北京市儿童的献花和祝词。
    会议在下午举行分组讨论。
