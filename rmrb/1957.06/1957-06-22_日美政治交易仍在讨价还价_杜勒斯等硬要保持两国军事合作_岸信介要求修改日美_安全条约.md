Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The political deal between Japan and the United States is still being bargained over.

Kishi Nobusuke, the Japanese Prime Minister, held talks with US Secretary of State Dulles on the 20th regarding issues in the relationship between Japan and the United States.

On the morning of that day, the two sides first discussed political and military issues between the two countries. According to the Associated Press, at this meeting, Dulles and Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, who participated in the talks, used "the strongest terms" to propose to Kishi Nobusuke that "the closest and most lasting military cooperation must be maintained between Japan and the United States to prevent the expansion of communism in Asia and the Pacific."

According to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida, who participated in the talks, told reporters after the meeting that Kishi Nobusuke had also stated to Dulles and others during the talks that the true friendship between the United States and Japan cannot be based solely on treaties and agreements, but on "true understanding." According to Reuters, citing authoritative sources, Kishi Nobusuke requested the United States during the talks to make a "major revision" to the Japan-US "Security Treaty" which allows US troops to be stationed in Japan, and suggested stipulating the date of termination of the treaty (currently, the treaty can only be abolished with the consent of the United States). Kishi Nobusuke also requested that the United States specify a date for the return of Okinawa to Japan.

In the afternoon of the same day, Kishi Nobusuke also discussed economic issues between the two countries with Dulles and officials from the US Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce. Henderson said that the two sides discussed six issues at this meeting: Japan-US trade relations, Japan's relations with China (including trade relations), development of Southeast Asia, US military orders to Japan, and US funding to Japan. Kishi Nobusuke explained Japan's economic situation, requested the United States to increase funding for the development of Southeast Asia, and expressed the hope to expand trade with China. However, Henderson said that the two sides did not reach a conclusion on any of the issues.

Kishi Nobusuke delivered a speech in the US Congress on the same day. In his speech, he emphasized that the relationship between Japan and the United States is "the most important" and expressed his intention to play an "active role" in anti-communist activities in Asia.

　　日美政治交易仍在讨价还价
    杜勒斯等硬要保持两国军事合作
    岸信介要求修改日美“安全条约”
    据新华社20日讯　日本首相岸信介20日同美国国务卿杜勒斯就日美两国关系中的问题进行了会谈。
    当天上午，双方首先讨论了两国间的政治和军事问题。据合众社报道，在这次会议上，杜勒斯和参加会谈的美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福“用最强烈的字眼”向岸信介提出，“必须保持日美两国间最密切的持久的军事合作，以防止共产主义在亚洲和太平洋扩张”。
    据参加会谈的日本内阁官房长官石田博英在会后告诉记者说，岸信介在会谈中还曾经向杜勒斯等人表示，美国和日本之间的真正友谊不能仅仅以条约和协定为基础，而是以“真正的谅解”为基础。据路透社引权威人士的消息透露，岸信介在这次会谈中曾经要求美国把允许美军驻在日本的日美“安全条约”作一次“重大的修改”，并且建议规定这项条约的终止的日期（目前这项条约只有在美国同意下才能废除）。岸信介还要求美国规定一个把冲绳岛归还日本的日期。
    当天下午，岸信介又同杜勒斯以及美国财政部、商务部的官员们讨论了两国间的经济问题。汉德逊说，双方在这次会议上讨论了日美贸易关系、日本同中国的关系（包括贸易关系）、开发东南亚、美国向日本的军需订货、美国资助日本等六个问题。岸信介说明了日本的经济情况，要求美国增加开发东南亚的资金，并且表示希望扩大同中国的贸易。但是，汉德逊说，双方没有在任何一个问题上得出结论。
    岸信介当天曾经在美国国会发表演说。他在演说中强调日本同美国的关系是“最重要的”，并且表示要在亚洲的反共活动中起“积极的作用”。
