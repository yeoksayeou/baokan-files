Combining Rectification Campaign to Strengthen the Handling of People's Letters and Visits

The joint conference on handling people's letters and visits, co-sponsored by the General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, has concluded. Prior to this, a conference on receiving people's visits by central agencies in Beijing was also held. These two meetings are of great significance for the current rectification movement.

As early as 1951, Chairman Mao instructed us that we must attach importance to people's correspondence, give appropriate treatment to people's letters, meet the legitimate demands of the masses, and regard this matter as a method for the Communist Party and the People's Government to strengthen ties with the people, and not adopt a bureaucratic attitude of indifference and neglect. This instruction played a significant role in promoting the handling of people's letters and visits by party and government agencies at all levels at that time and afterwards. However, upon serious examination today, only a small portion of the agencies have truly done a good job in this work. Most agencies have not done well, and some agencies have done very poorly, with many problems, shortcomings, and errors.

Why can't many agencies do a good job in handling people's letters and visits? The most fundamental reason is that many of our agencies have developed a bureaucratic work style. After the victory of the revolution, the leading agencies entered the cities, the working and living environments changed, and the ideological style of the cadres also changed. Many people, including some veteran cadres, have become estranged from the masses, their mass viewpoint has weakened, they are less concerned about the suffering of the masses, and they are unwilling to do in-depth mass work. Some agency leaders regard people's letters and visits as trivial matters and are unwilling to intervene; they do not handle them, or do not handle them seriously, and even transfer accusations to the accused, creating incidents of retaliation. Many business departments regard people's letters and visits as an "extra burden," believing that doing too much of it will affect their own business. Some comrades who do this work also believe that this work is not specialized, "has no drill bit," and feel inferior. Obviously, these ideas are wrong.

Handling people's letters and receiving people's visits should be an important task of the Party and the government. Especially at present, when correctly handling contradictions among the people occupies an important position in all tasks, the political enthusiasm of the people is growing vigorously, the number of letters and visits to various agencies has increased significantly, and the content is becoming richer, handling people's letters and visits should become an important task in the work of leading agencies. All party and government leaders and all staff members must have a comprehensive and profound understanding of this.

By writing letters and talking face-to-face, the people put forward various demands to the leading organs, express various wishes, make suggestions on various tasks, and criticize some staff members, all of which are a democratic right granted to them by the Constitution. All leading organs should protect this right of the people and ensure that the people can exercise this right conveniently. Experience has proved that most of the problems raised in people's letters and visits are correct and reasonable; although many of them are one-sided opinions, unrealistic ideas, and very trivial matters. However, the fact that the masses can raise them to us is essentially a manifestation of trust in the Party and the government. We must not have the slightest sense of weariness about this, and we must not adopt any sloppy attitude. If the Party and government leading organs can hear more opinions and more criticisms from the masses, our various tasks will progress faster and be done better. Therefore, all agencies of the Party and the state should regard the serious handling of people's letters and the reception of people's visits as their own political responsibility.

Handling people's letters and visits is a way for leading agencies to contact the masses and understand the situation. At present, the party and government agencies at all levels receive millions of letters from the masses and receive millions of visits from the masses every year. Properly handling the problems they raise can establish contact with millions of people. Through this contact, we can understand a lot of situations. Many agencies often send many cadres down to investigate materials, which is naturally necessary, but they ignore the materials delivered to their doorsteps through people's letters and visits, which should be said to be a shortcoming. Shao Shiping, the Governor of Jiangxi Province, stipulates that he will receive visiting masses every Thursday morning, and has persisted for several years. Several governors of the Henan Provincial People's Committee have organized themselves to take turns to receive the masses, which has also formed a system, which has had a very good response among the masses and has been of great help to the work of the agencies. Therefore, all leading cadres should read people's letters and receive visiting masses, and form a good system and atmosphere like participating in physical labor, and persist in it.

Through people's letters and visits, we can help understand and resolve contradictions among the people. Since the central government put forward the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people, many places have paid attention to actively solving some problems through people's letters and visits, which has both improved their work and won the support of the masses. This is an experience worth paying attention to.

Through handling people's letters and visits, we can also publicize policies and examine the implementation of policies. Not all kinds of demands raised by the masses can be both reasonable and solvable. Even if the masses put forward some unreasonable and unsolvable demands, we should also take this opportunity to patiently explain the policies to the masses, make the actual situation and difficulties clear, and thoroughly explain the principles, so that the masses can understand the difficulties of the country and change their own ideas. The problems raised by the masses from their own perspective are naturally some local and individual matters, but as long as we are good at comprehensive research, we can find some general problems from them. Sometimes, some of the masses express different opinions on certain measures in their letters and visits, which can enlighten the leading agencies and learn from experience and lessons from both positive and negative perspectives, and help improve the work.

It can be seen that handling people's letters and visits is a big deal, not a small deal; it is a regular and important political task of the Party and government agencies, not an optional administrative work.

The key to the problem lies in leadership. The conference decided that it is suggested that each department of the Central Committee should have a minister in charge of this work, and each provincial, autonomous region, and municipal party committee should have a secretary, and the People's Committee should have a governor (chairman, mayor) in charge of this work. This is the most effective measure to strengthen this work. Of course, the leading comrades who are in charge of this work should not manage it formalistically, but should truly manage it. They should: read some important letters; receive some visiting people; regularly supervise and guide this work; and raise important issues in the work to the leading organs for discussion and resolution.

Of course, this meeting is only the beginning of strengthening this work. It will take an effort to make this work from being neglected to being valued, and from being done poorly to being done well. We hope that the party and government leading organs at all levels will seriously study the issues and experiences raised at this meeting in conjunction with the current rectification movement, and, in the spirit of rectifying while correcting, earnestly strengthen the handling of people's letters and visits; and promote the rectification movement of the organs through the handling of people's letters and visits.

### 结合整风运动，加强处理人民来信来访工作

    结合整风运动，加强处理人民来信来访工作
    国务院秘书厅和中共中央办公厅联合召开的处理人民来信、来访工作会议，已经结束了。在此以前，还召开了一次北京中央各机关接见群众来访工作会议。这两次会议，对目前的整风运动很有意义。
    1951年毛主席就指示我们，必须重视人民的通信，要给人民来信以恰当的处理，满足群众的正当要求，要把这件事看成是共产党和人民政府加强和人民群众联系的一种方法，不要采取漫不经心、置之不理的官僚主义态度。这个指示，在当时和以后，对于推动各级党和政府机关的处理人民来信、来访工作起了很大的作用。但是，今天认真检查起来，这项工作真正做得好的机关，还只占一小部分，大部分机关做得不好，一部分机关做得很不好，问题很多，缺点、错误很多。
    为什么很多机关不能把处理人民来信、来访工作做好呢？最根本的原因，是我们许多机关滋长了官僚主义作风。革命胜利以后，领导机关进了城，工作环境和生活环境变了，干部思想作风也发生了变化。有很多人，包括某些老干部在内，和群众疏远了，群众观点薄弱了，不大关心群众的疾苦，不愿意深入做群众工作。有些机关领导人，把群众来信、来访当做是“鸡毛蒜皮”的小事情，不愿意过问；不处理，或者不认真处理，甚至把控告的信件，转到被控告人手里，造成打击报复事件。许多业务部门把群众来信、来访看成是“额外负担”，认为做多了，影响自己的业务。一些做这项工作的同志，也认为这项工作不是专业专行，“没有钻头”，觉得自己低人一等。显然，这些想法都是错误的。
    处理人民来信、接待群众来访应当是党和政府一项重要工作。特别是当前正确处理人民内部矛盾在各项工作中占到了重要的地位，人民群众的政治积极性正在蓬勃地增长，各机关的来信、来访数量大量增加，内容愈加丰富，处理人民来信、来访工作更应当成为领导机关工作中的一项重要任务。对此，各级党政领导人员和全体工作人员，都必须有全面的、深刻的认识。
    人民群众通过来信和面谈，向领导机关提出各种要求，表示各种愿望，对各项工作提出意见，对一些工作人员提出批评，都是宪法所赋予他们的一种民主权利。一切领导机关都应当保护人民这种权利，并保证人民能够方便地行使这种权利。经验证明：人民来信、来访中提出的问题，大部分是正确的、合理的；虽然其中也有很多是片面的意见，不切实际的想法，很琐碎的事务。但是群众能够向我们提出来，本质上是信任党和政府的表现。我们对此决不能有丝毫厌倦情绪，决不能采取任何马虎态度。如果党和政府领导机关能够听到群众更多的意见，更多的批评，我们的各项工作还会进步得更快，做得更好。因此，党和国家的一切机关，都应当把认真处理人民来信、接待群众来访当成自己的一项政治职责。
    处理人民来信、来访工作，是领导机关联系群众和了解情况的一种方法。现在各级党、政机关收到的群众来信和接见的群众来访，一年有几百万件，恰当地处理他们所提出的问题，就可以同几百万群众建立联系，经过这种联系，就可以了解很多情况。有许多机关，经常派很多干部下去调查材料，这自然是必需的，但是他们忽视了人民来信、来访的这种送上门的材料，应当说是一个缺点。江西省长邵式平规定每星期四上午接见来访群众，几年来一直坚持下来。河南省人民委员会几个省长，组织起来轮流接见群众，也已形成制度，在群众中反应很好，对机关工作有了很多帮助。因此一切领导干部都应当阅看人民来信、接见来访群众，像参加体力劳动一样，形成一种良好的制度和风气，坚持下去。
    经过人民来信、来访，可以帮助了解和解决人民内部矛盾。自中央提出正确处理人民内部矛盾问题以后，许多地方已经注意通过人民来信、来访，主动地解决一些问题，既改进了工作，又获得了群众拥护，这是一个值得重视的经验。
    经过处理人民来信、来访工作，还可以宣传政策、考查政策的执行情况。群众提出的各种要求，不可能都是既合理而又能够解决的。即使群众提出了一些不合理的、不能解决的要求，我们也应该利用这个机会，耐心地向群众解释政策，把实际情况和困难说清楚，把道理讲透彻，使群众体谅国家的困难、改变自己的想法。群众从自己的角度出发，提出的问题，自然是一些局部的个别的事情，但是，只要我们善于综合研究，就能够由此发现一些带普遍性的问题。有时候，一部分群众在来信、来访中表示对某些措施有不同的意见，可以使领导机关得到启发，从正面和反面吸取经验教训，帮助改进工作。
    由此可见，处理人民来信、来访工作，是大事，不是小事；是党和政府机关一项经常的重要政治任务，不是可有可无的事务工作。
    问题的关键还在于领导。这次会议上决定：建议中央各部门要有一位部长管理这项工作，各省、自治区、直辖市党委要有一位书记，人民委员会要有一位省长（主席、市长）管理这项工作。这是加强这项工作最有效的措施。当然，分工主管这项工作的领导同志，不能形式主义地去管理，要真正管起来。他们应该做到：看一些重要来信；接见一些来访的人；经常对这项工作进行监督和指导；将工作中的重要问题提到领导机关会议上讨论解决。
    当然，这次会议只是加强此项工作的开端，要使此项工作从不被重视到被重视，从办的不好到办好，还需要一个努力过程。我们希望各级党政领导机关，结合当前的整风运动认真研究这次会议提出的问题和经验，本着边整、边改的精神，切实加强处理人民来信、来访工作；并且经过处理人民来信、来访工作，推动机关整风运动前进。
