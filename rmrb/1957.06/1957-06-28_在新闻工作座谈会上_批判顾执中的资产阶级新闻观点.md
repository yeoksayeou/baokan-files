Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: A news work symposium continued on the 27th to criticize anti-socialist bourgeois journalistic views.

　　Zhang Henshui spoke first at the meeting. He said: Today's news is tomorrow's history. In a society where class struggle still exists, news and history record and comment on class struggle, and therefore, they naturally possess class character and Party spirit. The same thing, viewed from different standpoints and perspectives, will produce different news reports. For example, when we criticize Chu Anping's speech, newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong cheer for him and salute him. Isn't this clear? In our socialist country, any undertaking that deviates from the leadership of the Communist Party will make mistakes. In recent months, Guangming Daily, dominated by Chu Anping and others, has made right-leaning errors. Some people at our symposium have spoken about putting on a rival show against the Party newspaper. I resolutely oppose this right-leaning error.

　　Chen Mingde of Shanghai Xinmin Evening News said at the meeting: I neglected the primary function of socialist newspapers as collective propagandists, agitators, and organizers, and I viewed the remediable, non-essential shortcomings of some newspapers over the past few years as essential flaws. Therefore, I proposed the idea of running a colleagues' newspaper, which reflects my strong bourgeois journalistic views. Since the beginning of the anti-rightist campaign, I have recognized this error. I now declare the withdrawal of this proposal, and I will continue to examine the ideological roots of this error.

　　Next, Gu Zhizhong delivered a speech at the meeting entitled "The Class Character, Authenticity, Timeliness, and Interest of News, and Their Interrelationships." He quoted extensively from the speeches of Kalinin, Lu Dingyi, Hu Qiaomu, Zhou Yang, as well as editorials from Liberation Daily and a certain year's work instructions from Xinhua News Agency, but he avoided addressing his recently published remarks on the constitution, freedom of speech, and journalistic work as much as possible. When discussing class character, he said that the Guangming Daily's errors in the previous period were merely due to Chu Anping blurring the newspaper's class stance and adopting old bourgeois methods of running the newspaper. He also said that Wenhui Daily's error was mainly due to prioritizing editing techniques and neglecting politics.

　　After Gu Zhizhong's speech, many people stood up to refute him and expressed indignation at his attitude. He Kaifu of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China said that Gu Zhizhong repeatedly emphasized class character, but he said that Chu Anping's alteration of the political direction of Guangming Daily was due to Chu Anping blurring class character, which can only be seen as defending Chu Anping, because Chu Anping understood the class character of newspapers very well and clearly stood on the bourgeois revisionist position to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. Fang Hanqi of the Journalism Department of Peking University refuted Gu Zhizhong's absurd claim, reprinted in the People's Daily on the 26th under the title "What Words," that some aspects of the constitution have been completely destroyed, some exist in name only, and freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association are not guaranteed in reality. Fang Hanqi cited many historical materials to illustrate that the history of Chinese journalism before liberation was a history of journalists' blood, with countless journalists being killed and imprisoned, and countless newspapers and periodicals being shut down. In old China, only a handful of rulers had freedom of speech, and the vast majority of the people had no freedom of speech. Our new Chinese newspapers and periodicals are a new type of newspaper and periodical that serves the working people, and every working person can criticize the government's work through newspapers. Of course, we do not have freedom of speech for counter-revolutionaries and landlords here. Fu Jifu of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China raised four questions to Gu Zhizhong: First, what is the basis for saying that Chu Anping's anti-socialist activities in Guangming Daily only blurred the newspaper's class stance? Second, Wenhui Daily has become a platform for bourgeois rightists in the previous period, which shows that it attaches great importance to politics. Why is Wenhui Daily said to have committed the mistake of emphasizing technology and neglecting politics? Third, Gu Zhizhong quoted a lot of documents and had very few of his own opinions. Why did he not elaborate on the remarks about him reprinted in the People's Daily yesterday? Fourth, Gu Zhizhong said that the editing of news has no class character. Chairman Mao received representatives of the Communist Youth League and said that all words and actions that deviate from socialism are wrong. This news was prominently placed in large headlines by People's Daily and Liberation Daily, but Wenhui Daily reduced it to the point where it was hardly noticeable to careless people. Isn't this the class character of editing?

　　After these speeches, Gu Zhizhong stood up again to speak. He said that he would thoroughly admit his mistakes and make a self-criticism, but he vaguely answered the criticisms and questions raised by everyone, and he still insisted that the editing of newspapers has no class character.

　　Ye Fu, who used to work at Wenhui Daily and now works at Teachers' Newspaper, criticized Xu Zhucheng's speeches at the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference and the last news work symposium at the meeting. He said that Wenhui Daily had made four mistakes from liberation to recently, all of which stemmed from not standing firmly on the proletarian position. In the past, when discussing the issue of "The Life of Wu Xun," the Wenhui Daily's supplement "Literary Circle" was once controlled by Hu Feng elements. Errors such as the discussion on the issue of "Dream of the Red Chamber," as well as the recent alteration of the newspaper's direction to a bourgeois one, occurred when the Party's leadership was weakened. Judging from these historical lessons, any attempt to break away from the Party's leadership, or verbally talk about the Party's leadership but actually try to do another set of things, is wrong. Ye Fu disagreed with Xu Zhucheng's assessment that the work of Wenhui Daily before the revision had no achievements. He said that the work of Wenhui Daily from 1953 to 1956 played a certain role in China's education work. Within the newspaper, the Party carried out ideological reform and anti-espionage work for the staff, and the enterprise changed from private to joint public-private ownership. The Party's political and business leadership enabled Wenhui Daily to play a certain role in cultural and educational work and construction undertakings. Ye Fu also suggested that Wenhui Daily should seek truth from facts and conduct a deep examination from aspects such as reporting, history, and its relationship with bourgeois rightists.

　　Mei Yi, Director of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau, said when talking about the Party's leadership in journalistic work that he disagreed with the view that the Party was managing too much, journalistic work was not being done well, and the enthusiasm of cadres was being undermined. He believed that the stronger the Party's leadership, the better the work, and the more the enthusiasm of cadres could be brought into play. He said that radio stations are a part of the ideological front. In their own programs, they should clearly tell the audience what they support and what they oppose. They should express opinions and propose correct ideas on existing problems in work and thought. To achieve this, on the one hand, they must work hard to improve their own ideological and political level, and on the other hand, they must also ask the Party to strengthen its leadership over broadcasting. At the Fourth National Broadcasting Work Conference last year, we unanimously believed that strengthening the Party's leadership is a fundamental condition for running broadcasting well. He said that if newspapers and radio stations are not led by the proletariat, they will be led by the bourgeoisie. The so-called "detached" position, the so-called "minor criticism, major help," and other fallacies are actually a pretext for the bourgeoisie to seize the leadership of the newspaper. Mei Yi said that recently some people have said that the constitution is empty talk, there is no freedom of the press, there is a crisis in journalistic work, and that the Party is managing too much and there is too little freedom of the press. Mei Yi believes that this is obviously a matter of position. The problem is not how much freedom of the press there is, but what kind of freedom of the press is needed. If what they want is the freedom to oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, then that is the real crisis of journalistic work.

　　At today's symposium, Zhang Fan of China News Service, Sun Guoliang, Shi Dapeng, and Yi Liewu of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China also criticized the speeches of Zheng Baitao, Chen Shijing, Mo Rujian, and others at the news work symposium. Mao Jianwu of Ta Kung Pao also spoke at the meeting.

　　The symposium will continue tomorrow.

### 在新闻工作座谈会上  批判顾执中的资产阶级新闻观点

　　在新闻工作座谈会上
    批判顾执中的资产阶级新闻观点
    新华社27日讯  新闻工作座谈会27日继续批判反社会主义的资产阶级新闻观点。
    张恨水首先在会上发言。他说：今天的新闻就是明天的历史，在依然存在着阶级斗争的社会里，新闻和历史就是记载和评论阶级斗争的，它当然是有阶级性和党性的。同一的事物，从不同的立场和观点，就会发出不同的新闻。例如储安平的发言，我们批判他，同时台湾和香港的报纸就为他喝彩，向他致意。这不是很清楚的吗？我们社会主义国家，任何事情要是脱离了共产党的领导，就会犯错误。近几个月来，光明日报为储安平等支配，就犯了右倾的错误。我们的座谈会上，有人发言要和党报唱对台戏，这种右倾的错误，我坚决反对。
    上海新民晚报陈铭德在会上说：我忽视了社会主义报纸作为集体的宣传者、鼓动者和集体的组织者的主要功能，又把几年来一些报纸的可以克服的非本质的缺点看成了本质的缺点，因而提出了办同人报纸的建议，这反映了我的浓厚的资产阶级新闻观点。在开始反右派以来，我认识到这个错误。我现在声明撤回这一建议，同时我还要继续检查产生这一错误的思想根源。
    接着顾执中在会上作了题为“新闻的阶级性、真实性、时间性、趣味性及其相互关系”的发言，他大量引用了加里宁、陆定一、胡乔木、周扬的言论以及解放日报的社论和新华社某一年关于工作的指示，但是尽量避免涉及自己最近发表的关于宪法、言论自由和新闻工作问题的种种言论。他在谈到阶级性时，他说光明日报前一时期的错误只是储安平模糊了报纸的阶级立场，采用旧的资产阶级的办报方法来办报。他又说文汇报的错误主要是犯了编排技术第一忽视政治的毛病。
    顾执中发言后，许多人起来反驳他，对他的发言态度表示愤慨。中国人民大学新闻系的何开府说，顾执中一再强调阶级性，但他却说储安平的篡改光明日报的政治方向是由于储安平模糊了阶级性，这只能说是在为储安平辩护，因为储安平是很懂得报纸的阶级性的，并且明显的站在资产阶级的修正主义的立场来反对共产党领导反对社会主义。北京大学新闻系的方汉奇对人民日报26日“什么话”所转载顾执中的宪法有的被彻底破坏，有的有名无实，言论、出版、集会、结社的自由事实都没有得到保证的谬论进行了驳斥。方汉奇援引了很多历史上的材料，说明解放前中国新闻的历史，是一部记者之血的历史，曾有无数的新闻记者被杀害被监禁，无数的报刊被封闭。在旧中国只有一小撮的统治者有言论自由，绝大多数的人民是没有言论自由的。我们新中国的报刊是新型的报刊，它是为劳动人民服务的，每一个劳动人民都可以通过报纸对政府的工作进行批评。当然我们这里是没有反革命、地主的言论自由的。中国人民大学新闻系的傅继馥对顾执中提出了四个问题：一、说储安平在光明日报反社会主义活动只是模糊了报纸的阶级立场，根据是什么？二、文汇报前一个时期已成为资产阶级右派分子的讲台，这说明它是很重视政治的，为什么要把文汇报说成是犯了重视技术忽视政治的毛病？三、顾执中引了很多文件，自己的意见很少，他对人民日报昨天转载他的那些言论为什么不作阐述？四、顾执中说新闻的编排是没有阶级性的。毛主席接见共青团代表说，一切离开社会主义的言论行动都是错误的。这一消息，人民日报，解放日报都用大字标题排在显著地位，文汇报却把它缩小到简直使粗枝大叶的人找不到的地步。难道这不是编排的阶级性吗？
    在这些发言后，顾执中又起来讲话，他表示要彻底承认错误，要作检查，但他对于大家提出的批评和问题却含糊不答，并且他还坚持说报纸的编排是没有阶级性的。
    曾在文汇报工作过的现在教师报工作的叶夫，在会上批评了徐铸成在上海宣传工作会议和上次新闻工作座谈会上的发言。他说，文汇报从解放后到最近犯了四次错误，都是出于没有站稳无产阶级立场。过去讨论“武训传”问题，文汇报副刊“文学界”曾一度被胡风分子掌握，关于“红楼梦”问题的讨论，以及最近报纸被篡改为资产阶级方向等错误，都是在削弱了党的领导的时候发生的。从这些历史教训来看，任何想脱离党的领导，或者口头上讲要党的领导，实际上想另搞一套的作法都是错误的。叶夫不同意徐铸成对文汇报改版前一段时期工作毫无成就的估计。他说，文汇报在1953年到1956年的工作，在中国教育工作中起了一定的作用。在报社内部，党进行了工作人员的思想改造和肃反工作，企业从私营改为公私合营，党在政治上和业务上的领导，使文汇报对文教工作和建设事业起了一定作用。叶夫还建议文汇报应实事求是，从报道、历史以及和资产阶级右派分子的关系等方面作深刻的检查。
    广播事业局局长梅益在谈到新闻工作中党的领导问题时，他不同意有些人说党管得多了、新闻工作不好作、干部的积极性受到了损害的看法。他以为党的领导加强了，工作越好作，干部的积极性越能得到发挥。他说，广播电台是思想战线的一部分，在它自己的节目里，应该明白告诉读者，它拥护什么，反对什么。它应该针对工作上和思想中存在的问题，发表议论，提出正确的意见。要作到这点，一方面要自己努力提高自己的思想政治水平，另一方面还要求党加强对广播的领导。在去年全国第四次广播工作会议上，我们一致认为加强党的领导是办好广播的一个根本条件。他说，报纸、广播电台如果不是无产阶级领导，就是资产阶级去领导。所谓“超然”地位，所谓“小骂大帮忙”等等谬论，实际上是资产阶级夺取报纸领导权的一种托辞罢了。梅益说，最近有些人说宪法是空话，新闻没有自由，认为新闻工作出现了危机，认为党管得太多，新闻自由太少。梅益认为这显然是一个立场问题，问题不在于新闻自由多少，而且要那种新闻自由的问题。如果他们要的是反对社会主义、反对共产党的领导的自由，那就是新闻工作的真正危机。
    在今天的座谈会上，还有中国新闻社的张帆，中国人民大学新闻系的孙国良、施大鹏、易烈武等对郑白涛、陈诗经、莫如俭等在新闻工作座谈会上的发言进行了批评。会上发言的还有大公报的毛健吾。
    座谈会明天继续举行。
