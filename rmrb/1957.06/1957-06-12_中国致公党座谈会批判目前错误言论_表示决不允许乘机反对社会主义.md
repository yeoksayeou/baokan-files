China Zhi Gong Party Symposium Criticizes Current Erroneous Statements
Declares No Opportunistic Opposition to Socialism Will Be Permitted

    This newspaper reports The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party convened a symposium to assist the Chinese Communist Party in its rectification campaign, continuing on the 10th. Chairman Chen Qiyou, who presided over the meeting, said that the Chinese Communist Party is the core force leading the Chinese revolution. This is a fact, and there is no room for the slightest doubt or denial. Currently, some people in the newspapers are denying the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, denying the achievements of the past few years, and distorting facts. This is wrong. We are not afraid of these people. The Chinese Communist Party, supported by 600 million people, will not be overthrown by these people's reactionary remarks.

    Xie Baihan said: The rectification of the Communist Party is actually a major event for the entire nation. Everyone has a responsibility to help the Party rectify and care about the Party, which means caring about our own destiny. When we help the Party rectify, we must adhere to two principles: one is to proceed from the interests of the country and the people, and the other is to safeguard the achievements of socialist construction. In my opinion, any practice that violates these two principles is dangerous.

    Of course, suggestions are welcome during rectification. Every Chinese person has the right and obligation to make suggestions to the Party, but if someone wants to use the platform of rectification to spread fallacies, take the opportunity to attack the Party, and oppose socialism, that is intolerable.

    Finally, he raised two points regarding the issues of overseas Chinese students returning to China for further education and domestic publications introducing the situation of overseas Chinese.

    Mai Yuanzhang criticized the work related to handling entry and exit procedures for overseas Chinese, hoping that the procedures for overseas Chinese going abroad should also be simplified. He also cited many facts to prove that the Communist Youth League in many schools and institutions has committed the mistake of dogmatism in its political education work for young people, making many overseas Chinese youth unrecognizable to their relatives, which has a very bad impact on overseas Chinese.

    Wu Chan said in his speech: Helping the Party rectify is to eliminate the "three evils." Good things can be said, and mistakes should be exposed and criticized even more. We should not be blinded by some remarks defending the bourgeoisie. To distinguish right from wrong and to distinguish the truth, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism. He also said: There is very serious bureaucracy in some schools. For example, an overseas Chinese student at Hunan Medical College suffered from severe lung disease. In 1955, he wrote a letter requesting help to go to the Beijing Asian Sanatorium for treatment. I forwarded it to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission on his behalf. Later, I received a letter from the school: "Comrade Wu Chan, your request to go to the Asian Sanatorium for treatment cannot be accommodated due to lack of beds, etc." They wrote back to me, turning me into the student with lung disease.

    Liu Minghan talked about two issues regarding long-term coexistence. He believes that the publicity for the united front policy was very insufficient in the past. Now that the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" has been proposed, we hope to have systematic publicity. Secondly, democratic parties are organizationally independent, but when I work with some CCP cadres, I feel that they are too polite and do not offer enough help in making positive suggestions. This creates an impersonal feeling invisibly. He believes that mutual research in various related tasks should be assistance between brothers and is not a matter of interference. We cannot reduce the responsibility of assistance on the grounds of "interfering in internal affairs."

    Regarding the issue of walls and ditches, he believes that what Mr. Deng Chumin said is correct. There are no ditches or walls between the people and the Communist Party, but there are some gaps between Party and non-Party members in institutions and schools. Moreover, these gaps are intermittent. These walls and ditches exist in some places, and in some places, we cannot say they are ditches, but only some barriers.

    Finally, he said that to tear down walls and fill ditches, everyone must take action.

    The symposium will continue.

　　中国致公党座谈会批判目前错误言论
　　表示决不允许乘机反对社会主义
    本报讯  中国致公党中央召开的帮助中国共产党整风座谈会，于10日继续举行。主持会议的陈其尤主席说，中国共产党是领导中国革命的核心力量，这是事实，不容有丝毫怀疑或否认。目前报纸上有人否认中国共产党的领导，否认几年来的成绩，歪曲事实，这是不对的，我们不怕这些人，六亿人民所拥护的中国共产党是不会为这些人的反动言论所推倒的。
    谢白寒说：共产党的整风，其实也是全国人民共同的大事，每个人都有责任帮助党整风，关心党，也就是关心我们自己的命运。我们帮助党整风，必需坚持两个原则：一是从国家人民的利益出发，一是维护社会主义建设的成果，一切违反这两个原则的做法，照我看来，都是危险的。
    整风当然欢迎提意见，每一个中国人民都有向党提意见的权利和义务，但是如果有人想利用整风的讲台来散布谬论，乘机攻击党，反对社会主义那是不能容忍的。
    最后，他对华侨学生回国升学和国内报刊介绍华侨情况问题提出了两点意见。
    麦元章就有关办理华侨出入国境的工作，提出批评，希望对华侨办理出国手续也应简化。他还列举了很多事实，证明不少学校机关的青年团对青年的政治教育工作，犯了教条主义的毛病，使不少华侨青年，六亲不认，这对海外华侨的影响很不好。
    伍禅在发言里认为：帮助党整风，是为了除三害，好的可以说，错误的更应揭露批评，我们不要为一些为资产阶级辩护的言论所蒙蔽。要明是非，分清真理，就要加强马列主义的学习。他还说：现在有些学校里，有很严重的官僚主义，如：湖南医学院一位华侨学生患严重的肺病，1955年来信要求帮助他到北京亚洲疗养院治疗，我代他分别转请侨委办理。后接学校来一封信：“伍禅同学，你要求到亚洲疗养院治病，因无床位，不能疗养等等”。给我回信，把我变成了那位患肺病的学生。
    刘铭汉就关于长期共存这一方面谈了两个问题。他认为，过去对统战政策宣传很不够。现在“长期共存，互相监督”的方针提出后，我们就希望作有系统的宣传。其次，民主党派在组织上是独立的，但我同一些中共干部研究工作时，感到客气有余正面提意见的帮助不够，这样无形中便会有不亲切的感觉。他认为，在各项有关工作中互相研究，应是兄弟间的帮助，并不是什么干涉的问题，不能以“干涉内政”而减少帮助的责任。
    关于墙和沟的问题，他认为邓初民先生所说的是对的，并不是人民同共产党有什么沟、墙，而是在机关学校中党同非党人士间的一些隔阂。而且这些隔阂是断断续续的，这些墙同沟有些地方有，有些地方不能说什么沟，只是某些隔阂而已。
    最后，他说，要拆墙填沟，就要大家都动手。
    座谈会仍将继续举行。
