　　I am expressing some opinions on the statements of Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, and others
　　Ma Yinchu
    The Communist Party is carrying out a rectification campaign because it is aware of the existence of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism—the three evils—among its members. Therefore, there is a rectification movement, and people outside the Party are asked to assist. I won't talk much about it here, only express my personal opinions on the views of Mr. Chu Anping, Mr. Ge Peiqi, and others.
    In my opinion, Mr. Chu Anping's words reflect the views of some people and are definitely not just his own opinion. After the election of the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Premier, and Vice-Premiers at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, I noticed that some people showed unhappy expressions. What Mr. Chu Anping said today represents the opinions of these people. I think it is okay to offer opinions to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou would never forbid others from criticizing them. They have no such intention. But Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou would never have the idea of a "Party-run world." Otherwise, why would there be the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)? The CPPCC Standing Committee is very active, even more so than the NPC Standing Committee. All important matters are openly consulted, soliciting opinions from all parties to gather wisdom and benefit everyone. There are no clauses about the Party and the CPPCC in the articles of the Constitution; they are all mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution. This indicates the meaning of the long-term coexistence of the Party and the CPPCC, and it can also be seen from this that there is no intention of a "Party-run world." I say that the CPPCC Standing Committee is more active than the NPC Standing Committee for two reasons: (1) Most members of the NPC Standing Committee also serve on the CPPCC Standing Committee, but not all members of the CPPCC Standing Committee also serve on the NPC Standing Committee. (2) Documents submitted to the NPC Standing Committee, after deliberation and discussion, are passed and become law; before becoming law, they are first discussed in the CPPCC to solicit opinions. The CPPCC is currently discussing plans for the Hui and Zhuang Autonomous Regions. Such a major matter is being discussed by the CPPCC, which shows that the Communist Party has no intention of a "Party-run world," and it shows that the "Party-run world" argument is wrong and incorrect.
    Mr. Lu Yuwen received anonymous letters. Writing anonymous letters is the behavior of a coward. If you have something to say, you might as well stand up and say it; don't be sneaky.
    I cannot accept the speeches of Mr. Ge Peiqi and Mr. Wang Dezhou. It is a fact that there is a phenomenon of a very small number of people in rural areas not having enough to eat. It is also a fact that there are contradictions between cooperative members and cooperatives, and between cooperatives and the government. But these facts will never lead to the act of killing Communists with knives and guns. Even if there are people with such ideas, they are only a very, very small number of counter-revolutionaries. Now I want to discuss this issue carefully and thoroughly.
    In 1956, we had 370 billion jin of raw grain, not including soybeans, but including potatoes (calculated at four jin of potatoes to one jin of grain), which was about 20 billion jin more than the unprecedentedly abundant harvest of 1955. This vivid fact eloquently proves the superiority of agricultural collectivization (when the country was founded in 1949, grain production was only 216.2 billion jin, not including soybeans. Before liberation, in the same period, people often starved to death in large numbers in disaster areas, and farmers were harmed by low grain prices in abundant areas, while coastal areas imported foreign rice and wheat).
    From the 370 billion jin of raw grain, we need to deduct (1) about 20 billion jin of seeds, 10 jin per mu (for sowing), totaling 2.2 billion mu, including replanting; (2) 20 billion jin of pig feed, about 200 jin needed per pig for 100 million pigs; (3) 84 million head of large livestock (cattle, horses, donkeys) need an average of 500 jin each, totaling 42 billion jin. These three items total 82 billion jin, leaving 288 billion jin. Dividing this by the population of 620 million on the mainland, the average is about 464 jin per person. This refers to raw grain; after husking, it needs to be discounted, at least 20% and at most 30%. If calculated at 20%, each person still has 371.2 jin; if calculated at 30%, each person only has 324.8 jin. If we take the average of 20% and 30%, each person has only 348 jin. From this 348 jin, we also need to deduct grain for industrial use (including soy sauce, yarn sizing, etc.), grain for handicrafts (such as making glucose, brewing wine, etc.), and 3 billion jin for export (overseas Chinese want to eat Longkou vermicelli, mung beans, etc.). In this way, this 348 jin of pure grain is tight. If the distribution is improper, there may be waste on one hand and cries of inadequacy on the other. The problem lies here. Some people say, why not import from foreign countries? Assuming we import 9 billion jin of grain from the Soviet Union, the first question is whether we have enough foreign exchange to pay for this import. Even if we did, the transportation capacity would be far from enough. Counting from the border, there are two railways from the Soviet Union to China, i.e., one train departs from Manzhouli and one from Erenhot every day to transport grain to Beijing, which would take three years and eight months to complete. And this does not include the time it takes to concentrate grain from various parts of the Soviet Union to Manzhouli and Erenhot, and to distribute it from Beijing to inland consumption locations. This is truly a case of "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." And 9 billion jin of grain is only equal to each of the 600 million people in the country eating one less mouthful of rice per meal. This amount is enough to support the scale of natural disasters in 1954 and 1956, which illustrates the importance of streamlining and saving. Saving one mouthful of rice per person is invisible, but if everyone in the country saves, the amount will be considerable and of paramount importance. Moreover, eating one less mouthful of rice per meal will not have any impact on physical health. But saving is only a temporary solution; the fundamental solution is to increase production. However, how to increase production is easy to say but very difficult to do. First, it requires funding. To electrify and mechanize agriculture, and to manufacture a large amount of chemical fertilizers, accumulation is needed. But where does accumulation come from? 79% of our annual national income is eaten up, and only 21% can be accumulated. In 1957, our country's national income was less than 100 billion yuan, and 21% is only 20 billion yuan. This 20 billion yuan needs to be distributed among heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, commerce, construction, transportation, etc.; and heavy industry includes coal, electricity, metallurgy, machinery, etc.; light industry is even more inexhaustible, including spinning, weaving, silk, flour, oil pressing, sugar making, paper making, food, etc.; agriculture includes forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, salt, economic crops, etc.; and there are many types of transportation, including air, land, and water; and construction also includes urban construction, rural construction, industrial construction, and bridge construction. Everyone wants to share a little bit. With 20 billion yuan divided like this, how much can each unit get? Our country suffers from having a large population, high consumption, and low accumulation.
    The path we are taking is the socialist road, and our lofty ideal is not to invade others or exploit others. First, we cannot exploit small and weak nations like capitalist countries; second, we cannot imitate Japan and use Chinese reparations as capital for industrial construction; third, we cannot borrow money from the United States. We cannot and do not want to take these three paths. We can only rely on our own efforts. But the funding is only 20 billion yuan. In the era of reactionary rule, this money was plundered by high officials, big businessmen, landlords, and compradors, and the reactionary government had to borrow money from foreign countries for construction, calling it "utilizing foreign capital," but in fact, it was utilized by foreign capital. The conditions were harsh, the interest rates were high, and guarantees were required, using customs duties and salt taxes as collateral, sacrificing sovereignty and humiliating the country, impoverishing the people and exhausting the wealth. This fund has now been taken back from the exploiters and is in the hands of the people themselves, but unfortunately, the amount is too small, because accumulation is not fast enough or large enough, so industrialization cannot proceed quickly. For example, the Sanmenxia project requires an investment of more than 10 billion yuan. Since a large power station has been built, a corresponding number of factories are needed to match it, otherwise the electricity generated will have nowhere to be used. But building these factories requires 60 to 100 billion yuan. Where does so much funding come from? We can only wait; it cannot be achieved in an instant. But in the process of waiting, there will inevitably be major floods, so during this period, we can only use small and medium-sized reservoirs and dikes. From this point of view, the former government did nothing, and the current government is not doing nothing, but is just starting (referring to Sanmenxia). Has our country ever had such a great project in the past few thousand years? I say that the lives of farmers will gradually improve, but it cannot happen overnight. The descendants of farmers will surely live a good life. If farmers knew this, how could there be anything like picking up knives and guns to kill Communists? Although a small number of farmers have worries about not having enough to eat, it will never lead to them taking up knives and guns to kill Communists, as Mr. Ge Peiqi and Mr. Wang Dezhou said. Farmers have gained many benefits from the revolution, such as the victory of land reform, where 300 million landless or land-poor peasants received 700 million mu of land and were exempted from 60 billion jin of rent grain and various exploitations exceeding the task each year to the landlords; after land reform, from 1950 to 1956, in seven years, the state allocated a total of 3.07 billion yuan for basic water conservancy construction; issued more than 1.31 billion yuan in disaster relief and relief funds; and spent more than 1.28 billion yuan to promote improved varieties, new farm tools, improve agricultural production technology, and prevent and control diseases and pests. The above three items total more than 5.66 billion yuan, which is equivalent to 35% of the 16 billion yuan agricultural tax paid by farmers to the government in seven years. In addition, the state lent farmers 8 billion yuan in low-interest loans in seven years, so that farmers would no longer be subject to usury. In this way, although a small number of people do not have enough to eat, they will not rebel.
    During the land reform, poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 60%-70% of the peasant population. Now it has shrunk to 15%. Those farmers who still live in poverty today are much better off than the poor peasants before liberation. They don't have to sell their sons and daughters, they don't have to starve or freeze, they don't have to wander the streets or beg. Under the care of the agricultural cooperatives, they can all live. In addition, the five guarantees system has also been implemented in rural areas. Other things, such as land that used to grow opium, is now used to grow grain and cotton. Bandits and hooligans cannot run rampant. The whole country is safe and can be traveled freely. This was unimaginable in the era of reactionary rule. How could there be peasant rebellion!
    I have said above that this 348 jin of pure grain is tight. If the distribution is improper, there may be waste on one hand and cries of inadequacy on the other. In this situation, how to solve it? For example, last year, the rations of most cooperative members were distributed equally according to the household population. I think this egalitarian method of distributing grain according to population is unreasonable. It is also very detrimental to consolidating cooperatives and developing production. Equal distribution of rations cannot be applied to situations where cooperative members are of different ages and have different labor power. It is obviously unreasonable to distribute the same amount to cooperative members with strong labor power and newborns. If the cooperative has a lot of surplus grain in addition to rations, which can be distributed according to labor, part of the problem can be solved. But what if the cooperative has no surplus grain, or very little? In this case, cooperative members can only buy some grain at high prices in the market or even on the black market, and sometimes even buy grain from households with more children at a price one-third higher than the listed price, which gives households with more children a great advantage. They get a lot of grain without much effort, and even if they don't have enough work points, they can buy grain at a lower price because they have the right to eat that much. Therefore, equal distribution of grain according to population is unreasonable and should be replaced by a grain distribution method that determines the amount based on the person, and the amount distributed should be determined by age; the grain distributed to children under one year old should be less than that distributed to children five years old. So I think that as long as the grain distribution method is improved, the tense situation can be resolved and the vast majority of farmers can be satisfied.
    China has two popular maxims: "If three brothers and four brothers are of one mind, the mud in front of the door can turn into gold." Today we also say: "Under the socialist system, our destiny is in our own hands." These maxims have important practical significance. If the people of the whole country unite and stand on one line, everyone will eat one less mouthful of rice per meal, which will not harm oneself, but will greatly benefit the country. No matter how great the flood, we can overcome it, and there will be no one who does not have enough to eat. Today, what we need most is unity and cooperation. Therefore, we must look at problems from an overall perspective and avoid looking at problems from a one-sided perspective. Because in today's situation, looking at problems from a one-sided perspective will lead to separation and hostility, while looking at problems from an overall perspective will lead to unity and mutual assistance.

　　我对储安平葛佩琦等的言论发表些意见
　　马寅初
    共产党整风，是因为自己晓得党员之中存在着官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义——三害。因此有整风运动，并要求党外人士协助。我在这里不多谈，仅对储安平、葛佩琦等先生的观点发表我个人的意见。
    储安平先生的话据我看来是反映了某些人的看法，决不是他一个人的意见。在第一届人民代表大会第一次会议发表了主席、副主席、总理、副总理以后，我当时看出有些人脸上露出不愉快的情绪，今天储安平所说的就是代表这一些人的意见。我想对毛主席、周总理提意见是可以的，毛主席、周总理决不会不许别人批评他们自己，他们决无此意。但毛主席、周总理决不会有“党天下”的想法，否则何必有政治协商会议。政协常委很活跃，其程度超过人大常委，什么要事都经过公开协商，征求各方面意见，集思广益。在宪法条文中皆不见有关于党与政协的字句，而都见之于宪法序言中，这就是表示党与政协长期共存的意义，也可从这里看出没有“党天下”的意图。我说政协常委活跃程度大于人大常委，有两个原因：（1）大多数人大常委兼政协常委，而政协常委不见得都兼人大常委。（2）提到人大常委的文件，经过审议讨论后，即通过变成法律；在未成法律之前先在政协讨论，征求意见。政协近日正在讨论回族和僮族自治区的方案，这样大的事要政协讨论，说明了共产党并没有“党天下”的意思，说明了“党天下”的说法是错误的，不对的。
    卢郁文先生收到匿名信，写匿名信是懦夫的行为，有话不妨站起来讲，不要鬼鬼祟祟。
    葛佩琦、王德周两先生的发言我是不能接受的。在农村中有绝少数人吃不饱的现象，这是事实，合作社社员与合作社之间有矛盾，合作社与政府之间有矛盾也是事实，但这些事实决不致引向用刀枪来杀共产党的行为，就是有这样想法的人，也是极少数极少数的反革命分子。现在我想就这个问题摊开来仔细谈一谈。
    1956年我们有三千七百亿斤原粮，但不包括大豆，只包括薯类在内（以四斤薯折一斤粮计）比空前丰收的1955年还多了二百亿斤左右。这一生动的事实雄辩地证明了农业合作化的优越性（1949年开国的时候，粮食产量只有二千一百六十二亿斤，不包括大豆。在解放以前，往往在同一时期内，灾区大批饿死人，丰产区谷贱伤农，而在沿海地区则进口洋米洋麦）。
    从三千七百亿斤原粮要扣去（1）二百亿斤左右的种子，每亩十斤（播种），共有二十二亿亩，连复种在内；（2）二百亿斤猪食，一亿头猪每头约需二百斤；（3）八千多万头大牲口（牛、马、驴）平均每头吃五百斤，共需四百二十亿斤。三项共计八百二十亿斤，尚余二千八百八十亿斤，用在大陆上的人口六亿二千万来除，平均每人约四百六十四斤，这是指原粮，去壳后尚需打个折扣，少则八折，多则七折。如以八折计，每人还有三百七十一点二斤；如以七折计，每人仅剩三百二十四点八斤。假如拿七折和八折平均计算，每人亦仅三百四十八斤，从这三百四十八斤中还要扣去工业用粮（包括酱油、浆纱等），手工业用粮（如制葡萄糖，酿酒等），出口三十亿斤（华侨要吃的龙口粉丝，绿豆等）。如此，这个三百四十八斤纯粮是紧的，分配不当，很可能一面有浪费，一面叫不足。问题在此。有人说为什么不从外国进口呢？假定我们从苏联进口九十亿粮食，首先要问有没有这许多外汇来支付这项进口货。就是有了，运输力量也远远不够。从国境线算起，从苏联到中国有两条铁路，即每天由满洲里和二连各开出一列车运粮食到北京，要三年八个月才能运完。而从苏联各地集中粮食到满洲里和二连，和由北京分运到内地消费地点，还不算在内。这真是远水救不了近火。而九十亿斤粮仅等于全国六亿几千万人每餐少吃一口饭而已。这个数目就足够支援1954年和1956年规模的天灾，这说明了精简节约关系之重大，每人的节约一口饭是看不见的，但是积少成多，全国人民大家节约起来其数就可观了，就具有头等重大的意义。况每人每餐少吃一口饭，于身体健康决不致有什么影响。但节约还只是治标的办法，治本还需要增产。不过增产如何增法，说说是容易，做起来非常困难，第一就需要资金，要使农业电气化、机械化，要制造大量化学肥料，这就需要积累。但是积累那里来？我们每年国民收入的79％是吃掉的，只有21％可以积累，1957年我国的国民收入在一千亿元以下，21％仅二百亿元，这二百亿元要分摊在重工业、轻工业、农业、商业、建筑业、运输业等等之中；而重工业中又有煤、电、冶金、机械等；轻工业中更说不尽了，有纺纱、织布、丝绸、面粉、榨油、制糖、造纸、食品等等；农业又包括森林、渔业、畜牧、盐业经济作物等等；而运输也不知有多少种，有空运、陆运、水运；再如建筑业也有城市建筑、乡村建筑、工业建筑、桥梁建筑之分。大家都要分一点，二百亿元要这样分，每个单位能分多少，我们国家吃亏的是人口多、消费多、积累少。
    我们走的道路是社会主义的道路，我们崇高的理想是不侵略别人，不剥削别人。第一我们不能像资本主义国家一样剥削弱小民族，第二我们也不能仿效日本拿中国的赔款作工业建设的资本，第三我们也犯不着向美国借款。这三条路我们都不能走也不愿走，我们只有自力更生。但是资金只有二百亿元，这笔钱在反动统治时代都给大官、大商、地主、买办剥夺了，而反动政府要建设只有向外国借钱，美其名叫“利用外资”，实际上反为外资所利用，条件苛，利息高而且要担保，要以关税、盐税作抵押，丧权辱国，民穷财尽。这笔资金现在已从剥削者手中夺回来，掌握在人民自己的手中，可惜数目太少，因为积累不够快，不够多，所以工业化的进行不能很快。例如三门峡工程需投资一百余亿元，既然建筑了大发电站，就需要相当数量的工厂来配合，否则发出的电就没处用了。但建设这些工厂需六百——一千亿元，那里来这么多的资金，我们只有等待，不能一刻就成。但是在等待的过程中还不免有大的洪水，所以我们在这时期只能利用中小型水库和堤防。这样看来，从前的政府是不做，现在的政府不是不作，而是正在开始（指三门峡）。过去几千年来我国有过这样伟大的工程吗？我说农民的生活会逐步提高，但不能一步登天，农民的子孙一定会过很好的生活。如农民知道了这件事，那里还会有拿起刀枪杀共产党的事出现呢？少数农民虽有吃不饱的忧虑，决不致如葛佩琦、王德周二位先生所讲的会拿刀枪杀共产党人。农民在革命中得到很多好处，如土改的胜利，三亿无地或少地的农民得到了七亿亩土地，并免除了每年向地主交纳的租粮六百亿斤及各种超出任务的剥削；土改后从1950年到1956年七年中，国家对水利的基本建设拨款共达三十亿七千多万元；发放救灾、救济经费十三亿一千余万元；用于推广优良品种、新式农具、提高农业生产技术及防治病虫害的经费有十二亿八千余万元。以上三项共五十六亿六千余万元，这数字相当于农民在七年中交纳给政府的价值一百六十亿元农业税的35％，此外，国家在七年中借给农民八十亿元低利贷款，使农民从此不再受高利贷的剥削。这样看来，虽然少数人吃不饱，也是不会造反的。
    在土改时，贫雇农占农民人口60％—70％，现在已经缩小到15％，那些今天还过着贫穷生活的农民比起解放前的贫农来说生活已好得多了，他们不用卖男卖女，不用挨饿受冻，不用流落街头，沿街乞讨，他们在农业社的照顾下，都能生活下去。此外农村中还实行了五保制，其他如以前种植鸦片的土地，现在也改种粮食和棉花了，盗匪流氓不能横行了，全国平安可以通行无阻了。这在反动统治时代是做梦也想不到的，那里还会有农民造反的事呢！
    我在上面已说过这个三百四十八斤纯粮是紧的，如分配不当，很可能一面有浪费，一面叫不足。在这种情形下，怎样去解决？如去年绝大多数合作社的社员口粮都是按照家庭人口平均分配的，我认为这种平均主义计口授粮的办法是不合理的。它对巩固合作社与发展生产也是很不利的。平均分配口粮不能适用于社员的年龄不同、劳动力不同的情况下。劳动力很强的社员与初生婴儿同样分配，显然是不合理的，三百四十八斤纯粮对一个年轻少壮的农民当然是不够的。倘如合作社除口粮外还有很多余粮，可以按劳分配的话，是能解决一部分问题的，但假如合作社没有余粮，或者余粮很少，那么又怎么办呢？在这种情况下，社员只能出高价到市场上甚至到黑市去买些粮食，间或还要以高出牌价三分之一的价格向小孩较多的农户去买进粮食，这样使小孩较多的农户占了很大的便宜。他们不甚费力地得到很多粮食，即使工分不足，也能用较低的价格买到粮食，因为他们有吃这样多的权利。所以平均计口授粮是不合理的，应代之以以人定量的粮食分配办法，分配多少按年龄而定；年龄不满一岁的小孩分得的粮食，应该比五岁小孩所分得的为少。所以我以为只要改进分粮办法，紧张局势就可解决，可以使绝大多数农民满意。
    中国有二句通行的格言，就是：“三兄四弟一条心，门前泥土变黄金”。今天我们也说：“在社会主义制度下，我们的命运掌握在我们自己的手中”。这些格言都有重要的现实意义。如果全国人民团结起来，站在一条线上，大家每餐少吃一口饭，于己无伤，而于国家则有大利，无论任何巨大洪水，我们都可以战胜，更不致有什么吃不饱的人了。今日我们最需要的是团结与合作，所以我们要从全面看问题，切忌从片面看问题，因为在今日的局势之下，从片面看问题，得出的结论是分离与仇视，从全面看问题，得出的结论是团结与互助。
