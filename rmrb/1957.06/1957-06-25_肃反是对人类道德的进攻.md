　　"The Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries is an Attack on Human Morality"
　　Assistant Teacher of Sanitary Engineering Department, Tongji University: Wang Changfeng

    I believe that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is an attack on human morality and a destruction of the human spirit. I disagree with the Party Committee's current approach of issuing individual apologies for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. I was also an active participant in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at the time. I also searched other people's letters and did things against my conscience, destroying my own personality. This is so despicable! Of course, people like me should not have done this kind of thing, and the organization did not ask me to do it, but in the atmosphere at the time, it was considered the right thing to do. But I am unwilling to apologize, and this is the responsibility of the Party. The policy at the time of "boldly suspecting" was wrong; it cannot turn all possibilities into realities. Therefore, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was an error of policy and not just an error in methods. Therefore, I suggest that the Party Committee should examine the errors in policy, not just individual apologies.
    The Party's grassroots organizations are lax and weary. Is it true that the achievements of the grassroots are the main thing, and that there are only some shortcomings? I have doubts about this. The Party's grassroots organizations suffer from serious dogmatism. The dogmatists have completely stifled the tasks assigned to grassroots organizations by the Party Constitution. The Party's grassroots organizations have been completely strangled by dogmatism and have been drowned out.

### “肃反是对人类道德的进攻”

　　“肃反是对人类道德的进攻”
　　同济大学卫生工程系助教　汪长风
    我认为肃反是对人类道德的进攻，对人类心灵的摧残。肃反问题现在党委采取个别道歉，我是不同意的。我当时也是一个肃反积极分子，我也曾搜查过别人的信件，做过违背自己良心的事，破坏自己的人格，这是多么卑鄙啊！这种事情当然像我这种人是不应做的，组织上也没有要我这样做，可是在当时的气氛下认为这样做是对的。但是我不愿道歉，这是要由党来负责的。当时的方针，大胆怀疑是错误的，它不能把一切可能性变为现实性。所以肃反是方针政策的错误，不单是方式方法上的错误。因此我建议党委应检查方针上的错误，不是单是个别的道歉。
    党的基层组织涣散、疲沓。是否基层作用成绩是主要的，缺点是有的呢？我是有怀疑的。党基层组织严重的教条主义，教条主义者把党章给予基层组织的任务全部扼杀了，党的基层组织是完全被教条主义所扼杀，已淹息。
