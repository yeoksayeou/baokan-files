The two governments resolutely oppose atomic war, which would bring enormous disasters to mankind. The two governments reaffirmed the need to immediately restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The peoples of Bulgaria and Hungary support the just struggle of the Chinese people to peacefully liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors.

The communiqué pointed out that the two governments share completely identical views on the question of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots and on consolidating peace in the Balkans and Central Europe.

The Hungarian government noted with satisfaction in the communiqué that the Bulgarian government had made great efforts to establish friendly relations between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. The communiqué also stated that the political, economic, and cultural ties between Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are becoming increasingly close. Bulgaria and Hungary will, in the future, make every effort to expand and deepen these ties under the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 13th: After talks, the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party signed a joint statement in Budapest on the 10th.

The statement pointed out that the two party delegations discussed the international political situation and the pressing issues of the international workers' movement, exchanged information on the situations of the two parties, formulated measures to further expand the ties between the two parties, and also exchanged views on many other issues. The statement pointed out that the primary task of the two parties is to strive for the comprehensive development of cooperation and fraternal relations between socialist countries and to defend and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union.

The two parties will unswervingly pursue a policy based on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and combine this doctrine with the specific conditions, national traditions, and economic characteristics of their respective countries. It is necessary for communist and workers' parties of all countries to strengthen ties, discuss and exchange opinions on various issues. The two parties will do their best to strengthen ties with all parties and countries that recognize socialist ideas, in order to expand the influence of the international workers' movement and strive for the unity of socialist and peace forces.
