Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th — Soviet engineers, Zhakovich, and deputy doctor of geophysics and engineer, Tarabrin, believe that atomic nuclear explosions are insufficient to cause changes in the weather.

　　They recently wrote in the "Red Star" newspaper, pointing out that since the first atomic bombs were detonated, foreign newspapers have published various predictions, believing that large thunderstorms and changes in temperature conditions may occur after nuclear explosions. However, facts have shown that all these predictions are incorrect. The reason is that there is a fundamental difference between atomic bomb explosions and natural processes in the atmosphere. As everyone knows, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere is the result of the cooling of the atmosphere and its water vapor when air masses rise to high altitudes. Usually, air rises as a result of uneven heating of different surface areas by sunlight, i.e., the result of so-called thermal convection. During an atomic bomb explosion, there are also two particularly distinct parts with different temperatures: the red-hot gas in the explosion zone and the relatively cold atmosphere surrounding this hot gas zone, which simultaneously creates conditions for enhanced thermal convection. However, unlike natural conditions, this convection only lasts for ten to fifteen minutes and is limited to a range of several kilometers. Therefore, such convection will not cause cloud formation and will not cause other meteorological factors to change in the atmosphere around the explosion area.

　　Various materials from atomic bomb tests conducted under extremely different meteorological conditions (i.e., in the presence of dense clouds, heavy fog, moments after thunderstorms, and clear weather) have confirmed the above conclusions. No weather changes occurred after the atomic bomb explosions. Even in weather with thunderclouds, atomic bomb explosions are insufficient to accelerate the process of thunderstorm formation.

　　To cause sudden changes in weather conditions in a vast area or individual regions, the energy required must be thousands of times greater than that released by atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions. The effect of this energy should be long-term, because a short-term impact cannot cause the atmosphere to deviate from the inertial state formed by natural forces.

　　苏联科学家指出
　　核爆炸不足以引起天气变化
　　这种爆炸和大气自然作用有原则性区别
    新华社莫斯科12日电  苏联工程师日阿科维奇和地球物理学副博士、工程师塔拉布林认为，原子核爆炸并不足以引起天气的变化。
    他们最近在“红星报”上撰文指出，自从第一批原子弹爆炸以后，外国报刊纷纷发表各种不同的预测，认为在核爆炸以后，可能产生大雷雨，气温状况会起变化等等。但是，事实表明，所有这些预测都是不正确的。其原因是：原子弹爆炸和大气中的自然作用之间存在着原则性的区别。大家都知道，大气中云的产生是当气团升到高空的时候，大气及其中的水蒸气冷却的后果。通常空气上升是由于阳光不均衡地晒热不同地表部分的结果，即所谓热对流的结果。在原子弹爆炸的时候，也出现温度不同的、特别明显的两个部分：爆炸区的赤热气体和这一热气区周围比较冷的大气，同时造成热对流加强的条件。但是这与自然条件不同，这种对流只进行十分到十五分钟时间，而且仅仅局限于几公里的范围之内。因此这样的对流不会引起云的形成，不会使其他气象因素在爆炸区周围的大气中发生变化。
    在极其不同的各种气象条件下（即在有密云、大雾、在雷雨后的片刻以及晴朗的天气的情况下）进行的原子弹试验的各种材料都证实了上述的结论。原子弹爆炸后没有发生天气变化。甚至在有雷雨云的天气里，原子弹爆炸也不足以加速雷雨形成的过程。
    要使广大区域或者个别的地区里的天气条件骤然起变化，必须要有千百倍于原子弹和氢弹爆炸时所发出的能。这种能的作用应当是长期的，因为短促的冲击不可能使大气脱离因自然力作用而形成的惯性状态。
