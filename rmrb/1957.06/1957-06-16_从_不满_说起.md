    Starting from "Dissatisfaction"
    Hu Sheng
    When people engage in a reform, they are always dissatisfied with the original situation. Because of dissatisfaction, there is reform, and because of reform, there is progress. In this sense, dissatisfaction is precisely the driving force of progress.
    However, can any kind of dissatisfaction promote progress? No. Everything must be analyzed, and "dissatisfaction" must also be analyzed.
      What exactly are people dissatisfied with? This, of course, is what
  should be clarified first. It may appear that people are expressing dissatisfaction with the same thing, but the starting points are completely different, and the desired results are also completely different. Such situations are often seen.
    Let's take a piece of history as an example. More than fifty years ago, the constitutional monarchy movement led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao was opposed by the stubborn feudal forces of the time, who wanted to cut off their heads. At the same time, the Tongmenghui, led by Sun Yat-sen, launched a critique of the constitutionalists immediately after its establishment. The stubborn faction disliked Kang and Liang because Kang and Liang demanded too many reforms; the Tongmenghui criticized Kang and Liang because Kang and Liang advocated only a little reform. The stubborn faction hoped to crush the movement of Kang and Liang and keep everything unchanged, while the Tongmenghui wanted to step over Kang and Liang and move further forward.
    This kind of situation often occurs in ideological struggles. Metaphysical materialism is criticized from two sides. Dialectical materialists criticize it because this kind of materialism lacks dialectics, and the purpose of this criticism is to free materialism from metaphysics and develop it forward. But there are also people who oppose metaphysical materialism by taking advantage of the low-level state of this materialism's lack of dialectics to oppose materialism; their purpose is not to make materialism grow, but to replace materialism with idealism. Similarly, dogmatism is also criticized from two sides. We oppose treating Marxism as a rigid dogma, and we want to overcome dogmatism and give play to the lively and vigorous fighting power of Marxism. But there are also people who oppose Marxism itself in the name of opposing dogmatism. They insist that admitting Marxist principles will make one a dogmatist, and that to oppose dogmatism, one must abandon Marxism. We are dissatisfied with those who have dogmatic habits because they have too little Marxism; revisionists also express dissatisfaction because, in their view, dogmatists have retained too much Marxism.
    Lenin mentioned in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" "criticism of Kantianism from the left and from the right." Kant was a dualist. Neither thorough idealists nor thorough materialists would be satisfied with dualism. But here there are two different criticisms. Lenin said: "The Machists criticize Kant because he is too much of a materialist, while we criticize Kant because he is not enough of a materialist. The Machists criticize Kant from the right, while we criticize Kant from the left." Two different starting points inevitably lead to two different results. The German professor Avenarius, who founded the philosophy of empirio-criticism, claimed to have criticized Kant and created a "new" direction in philosophy. But Lenin pointed out: "He does not fight Kant from the left like a materialist, but fights Kant from the right like a skeptic and an idealist. He thinks he is moving forward, but in fact he is moving backward."
    The Tongmenghui opposed Kang and Liang's constitutional movement from the left, while the feudal diehards opposed it from the right. We criticize metaphysics and dogmatism from the left, while idealists and revisionists criticize from the right. This distinction is very important.
    One starting point is the left, and the other starting point is the right. The starting points are opposite, and the directions are also opposite. One is pushing things forward, and the other is pulling them backward.
    In our country, socialist transformation has been basically completed, and socialist construction is being carried out on a large scale. For many things in the current social life, we can also see two different kinds of dissatisfaction, coming from the left and coming from the right.
    Is the socialist system good or not? The vast majority of Chinese people think: It is very good. First, it completely eliminated exploitation; second, it created the possibility of a great leap forward in social productive forces. We have basically realized the great transformation from a private ownership society to a public ownership society in a very short period of time, and we have every reason to be satisfied with this. But we are not satisfied with this. Having a socialist system does not mean that this system is completely consolidated. It will take a period of time and a lot of effort for the new social system to be fully consolidated in all aspects. Having a socialist system does not mean that everything is done well. To use all the possibilities provided by the new social system to develop our economic construction and cultural construction, and to make our country a rich and strong industrialized country, requires a longer-term effort. What we are now building is the lower stage of a public ownership society, that is, as Marx said in the "Critique of the Gotha Program," "a communist society that has just emerged from capitalist society, and which is therefore in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges." We are not satisfied with this, and we are prepared to use a longer period of effort to advance the lower stage of communist society to the higher stage of communist society. If we are satisfied with the status quo, satisfied with the state in which the socialist system has just been established, and satisfied with the primary stage of communism, then we cannot move forward. Moreover, in our past and present work, due to the lack of experience of the workers, the objective laws under the new social system have not been fully understood, or due to the influence of various decadent ideological styles left over from the old society, various shortcomings and errors have occurred. It is appropriate to feel dissatisfied with these shortcomings and errors. To struggle against these shortcomings and errors from the left means to criticize and self-criticize with the aim of consolidating the socialist system, strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, and strengthening the Communist Party's leading core role in socialist construction. This kind of criticism from the left is a manifestation of the socialist enthusiasm of our broad masses of people.
    Those who are still attached to the capitalist system, those who are still unwilling to give up the lifestyle of the exploiting class, feel dissatisfied with many aspects of the current social life, and strongly dissatisfied. This is completely understandable. This is dissatisfaction coming from the right. Many things cannot satisfy people coming from the right, not because our socialist system is still in the stage of just being established, and therefore shows some immature and undeveloped situations, but because we have actually established a socialist system in principle; not because this new society inevitably retains
  "the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges," but because this is already a brand-new society that is different from the old society in principle; nor is it because we still have many shortcomings and errors in our work, but because despite these shortcomings and errors, we have made great achievements in building a new society. To struggle against our shortcomings and errors from the right is actually to use these shortcomings and errors to oppose socialism, and its goal is to return to capitalism, to return to a society where a minority of privileged people oppress the majority.
    One is the position of supporting socialism, and the other is the position of opposing socialism. The difference here is very obvious. But because dissatisfaction and criticism from these two different positions sometimes seem to be directed at the same phenomenon, at this time, some people feel that it is not easy to distinguish them. For example, for some unnecessary and excessive centralization under democratic centralism, we put forward criticism, and we firmly maintain the necessary centralization for building socialism and advocate expanding democracy under this premise. But some people think that since excessive centralization is not good, then there should be no centralization at all. In fact, they oppose the socialist democratic centralism from the bourgeois democratic point of view, which is criticism from the right. Criticism from the right often uses this method to create confusion. Some people have legitimate dissatisfaction with some bad phenomena, but at the same time, they are not clear enough about what position they should take, and they are often confused by criticism from the right.
    We oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, because these bad ideas and bad styles are incompatible with the requirements of building socialism, and are incompatible with the requirements of uniting 600 million people to fight together under the leadership of the Communist Party. Socialism is not built in some absolutely pure "kingdom," and it is not surprising that there is all kinds of dirty garbage here. We firmly believe that the socialist system itself has the power to overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and we firmly promote socialist construction forward, constantly fighting against all the bad ideas and bad styles in the working cadres that can harm the socialist cause.
    People who oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism from the right disguise themselves as thorough and determined fighters against the "three evils." They oppose it even more "thoroughly" than we do! They are so "thorough" that they cannot tolerate any good words praising the socialist system, because it is said that saying a good word will hinder the struggle against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. They are so "thorough" that they believe that the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that still exist under the socialist system are worse than all bad things, so "bureaucracy is worse than capitalism." They are so "thorough" that they believe that it must be determined that since there are still bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism under this new social system, this social system should be abandoned.
    Therefore, "dissatisfaction" must be analyzed. In fact, there are various kinds of dissatisfaction, and the distinction between the left and the right mentioned here is the most fundamental distinction.
    Since there are two kinds of dissatisfaction with different natures and two kinds of criticism with different positions, what should be done? I think it should be like this:
    First, do not dare to criticize from the left because there is criticism from the right;
    Second, it is necessary to strictly distinguish between criticism from the left and criticism from the right, expose the true face of criticism from the right, and not let the voice from the right confuse our direction;
    Third, but it is also okay to listen to the voice from the right, as long as we stand firm, the voice from the right can also let us learn something and make us smarter.
    In addition to the distinction between the left and the right, there is another issue that needs to be discussed in the analysis of dissatisfaction, and that is the issue of starting from reality.
    It is easy to be dissatisfied with this and dissatisfied with that without truly contacting reality and without trying to truly understand the complex content of real life. Why are you dissatisfied? Because he has an extremely "perfect" and "beautiful" pattern in his mind. This pattern does not come from reality, and real life will never fully conform to his pattern.
    To demand starting from reality is not to ask people to be content with the status quo, not to ask people to admit that everything that actually exists is absolutely reasonable and unchangeable. Marxism demands objectively and comprehensively understanding facts, studying facts, grasping objective laws, and judging what should be promoted and what should be reformed, how to promote, and how to reform based on objective laws. Marxists are the people who respect objective facts the most, and at the same time, they are the people who are not afraid of change, who dare to, and who are best at carrying out reforms and promoting social progress. People who do not seriously look at real life, although they seem to have some beautiful ideals, but starting from their fabricated ideals, they will get nothing but dissatisfaction with reality. Because it is impossible to pull oneself up by one's own hair and be indignant, because people who are unhappy because real life is not like the "paradise" in the "kingdom of heaven" are not proletarian revolutionaries, but petty-bourgeois utopians.
    Rice must be eaten one bite at a time, and roads must be taken one step at a time. It is good to be dissatisfied because you have only taken a few steps and the road ahead is still long, and you want to continue walking. If you insist on measuring today's affairs with the distant future because you cannot jump to the future in one step, and then you are indignant, what is the meaning of this? Everyone knows that if you use modern standards to look at the human culture of the past era, and think that everything is absurd and unfounded, this is called anti-historicism. So, what is it called when a person lives in reality, but uses the standards of the future society he imagines to look at the present life, and expresses dissatisfaction with everything? It can probably be called anti-realism.
    We should be dissatisfied with the shortcomings and errors in our work, but here there is also the question of whether or not to start from reality. Truly starting from reality, people can appropriately estimate these shortcomings and errors, see the roots of their production, and thus find ways to overcome them. Conversely, people who do not start from reality, although they seem to deeply hate these shortcomings and errors, do not understand them. These shortcomings and errors are incomprehensible monsters to them, and thus become insurmountable things.
    Expressing dissatisfaction with real life starting from a fabricated fantasy and subjective wishes that are divorced from reality often happens among some young intellectuals. Due to the lack of practical knowledge of social life and the lack of experience in class struggle, it is understandable that they have this shortcoming. We should help young people learn the Marxist attitude of starting from reality, and make their valuable enthusiasm for progress built on the basis of recognizing the objective laws of society.
    It must also be pointed out that the question of whether or not to start from reality is actually still related to the distinction between the left and the right mentioned above.
    The real left must start from reality: to look forward, while not being divorced from the current reality. Then, are the people who put forward all kinds of dissatisfaction starting from a fabricated pattern on the right or on the left? If you say he is on the right, he will probably not be convinced. He always wants to make people believe that he is definitely not the right who looks backward, but the left who looks forward. But you must know that people who cannot truly see real life clearly must also be unable to see the real future. What he sees is only the illusion he created himself. Since he is not based on the objective laws of life development, he can only fabricate his beautiful illusion starting from personal interests; and the bourgeois ideological viewpoints that have a deep influence among intellectuals naturally become his basis in this situation. People who oppose any centralization with freedom think that they have put forward a "ideal" that is more far-reaching than democratic centralism, but they have only accepted the bourgeois viewpoint on individual freedom. Is it possible to call it left to express dissatisfaction with the reality of socialism with such an "ideal"?
    Therefore, the idea of being divorced from reality and demanding to reach the sky in one step seems to be very left, but in fact it is "left" that must be put in quotation marks. This kind of "left" is easy to lead to the right. Lu Xun once said: "It is easiest to talk about thorough doctrines when locked in a house, but it is also easiest to lean to the right." "If you do not understand the actual situation of the revolution, you can easily become a 'right wing'" (see "Two Hearts Collection"). Lu Xun was talking about the situation in the domestic class struggle which was very fierce thirty years ago, but this is still applicable today.
    Denying everything because of some shortcomings seems to be very "thorough," but in this way, it just "thoroughly" went to the right-wing camp that opposes socialism and attempts to return to capitalism. Here we can still borrow Lu Xun's words: "If it is said that for a large team of revolutionary troops, the consciousness of all soldiers must be very correct and clear, then this is a real revolutionary army, otherwise it is not worth a smile. This statement, at first glance, is of course very correct and thorough, but this is an impossible problem, it is empty talk, it is a sweet poison that harms the revolution." Lu Xun believed that this kind of high-sounding "seemingly thorough revolutionary" is, in fact, "an extremely unrevolutionary or harmful revolutionary individualistic debater" (see ibid.).
    Since "left" can lead to the right, dissatisfaction that consciously starts from the right often uses the form of "left" to capture those who "talk about thorough doctrines in the house." We have also said before that rightists sometimes express it in this way, as if they do not want socialism, just because they hate bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism so much that they would rather abandon socialism. They oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism so "thoroughly" and so "left" - the voice of the right and the voice of the "left" are mixed together in this way.

### 从“不满”说起

    从“不满”说起
    胡绳
    当人们从事一种改革的时候，总是对原来的某种情况感到不满。由于不满，就要改革，由于改革，就有进步。这样说来，不满正是进步的推动力量。
    但是，只要是不满，就能推动进步么？不是的。对于任何事情都要分析，对于“不满”，也要分析一下。
      究竟对什么事情不满，这当然是应当首先弄清楚的。看
  起来是对于同一个事情表示不满，但出发点完全不同，所希望达到的结果也完全不同，这种情形也是常常可以看到的。
    举一段历史做例。五十多年前，以康有为、梁启超为首的君主立宪运动受到了当时顽固的封建势力的反对，要砍他们的脑袋。但同时，孙中山所领导的同盟会在一成立后就展开了对立宪派的批判。——顽固派不喜欢康梁，是因为康梁要求太多的改革；同盟会批判康梁，是因为康梁所主张的只是那么一点改革。顽固派企望压碎康梁的运动，使一切事情照旧不变，同盟会是要跨过康梁而更往前进。
    在思想斗争中常常有这种情形。形而上学的唯物主义受到两方面来的批评。辩证唯物主义者批评它，是因为这种唯物主义缺乏辩证法，这种批评的目的是要使唯物主义摆脱形而上学而向前发展。但另外也有一种人，他们反对形而上学的唯物主义，是利用这种唯物主义的缺乏辩证法的低级状态来反对唯物主义；他们的目的不是使唯物主义成长起来，而是用唯心主义来代替唯物主义。同样的，教条主义也受到两方面的批评。我们反对把马克思主义当成僵死的教条，要克服教条主义而发挥马克思主义的生动活泼的战斗力量。但也有人在反对教条主义名义下反对马克思主义本身，他们硬说，承认马克思主义原理就会成为教条主义者，要反对教条主义就得抛弃马克思主义。对于有教条主义习气的人，我们不满，因为他们的马克思主义太少；修正主义者也表示不满，因为在他们看来，教条主义者手里的马克思主义留得太多了。
    列宁在“唯物主义和经验批判主义”中提到“从左来的和从右来的对康德主义的批判”。康德是二元论者。对于二元论，彻底的唯心论者和彻底的唯物论者都不会认为满意。但是在这里有两种不同的批判。列宁说：“马赫主义者批判康德是因为他过分是唯物主义者，而我们批判康德是因为他不够是唯物主义者。马赫主义者从右面批判康德，我们则从左面”。两个不同的出发点，必然带到两个不同的结果上去。创立经验批判主义哲学的德国教授阿万那留斯自命为批判康德而创立了哲学上的“新”方向。但列宁指出：“他不是像唯物主义者一样从左面来和康德作斗争，而是像怀疑主义者和唯心主义者一样从右面来和康德作斗争的。他以为他是在向前进，事实上他是在后退”。
    同盟会是从左面来反对康梁的立宪运动，而封建顽固派是从右面来反对。我们是从左面来批判形而上学和教条主义，而唯心主义者、修正主义者是从右面来批判。这种区别十分重要。
    一个出发点是左面，一个出发点是右面。出发点相反，方向也就相反。一个是把事情往前推进，一个是往后拉。
    在我们的国家里，已经基本上完成社会主义改造，正在大规模地进行社会主义建设。对于现在的社会生活中的许多事情，我们也可以看到两种不同性质的不满，从左面来的和从右面来的。
    社会主义制度好不好呢？绝大多数的中国人认为：好得很。第一，彻底消灭了剥削，第二，造成了社会生产力大踏步前进的可能。我们已经在很短的时间内基本上实现了从私有制社会到公有制社会的大变革，对于这，我们是完全有理由感到满意的。但是我们并不以此为满足。有了社会主义制度，不等于这个制度已经完全巩固了。新的社会制度在各方面完全巩固起来，还需要一段时间，还需要人们做很多努力。有了社会主义制度，更不等于一切事情都办好了。要利用新的社会制度所提供的一切可能性，来发展我国的经济建设和文化建设，使我国成为一个富强的工业化的国家，这就需要作更长期的努力。我们现在所正在建立起来的是低级阶段的公有制社会，就是像马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中所说的“刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来，因此在各方面，即在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕迹的共产主义社会。”我们并不以此为满足，我们准备用更长时期的努力来把共产主义社会的低级阶段推进到共产主义社会的高级阶段。如果我们满足于现状，满足于社会主义制度刚刚建立起来的状况，满足于共产主义的初级阶段，那么我们就不能前进。而且在我们的以往和现在的工作中间，由于工作者缺乏经验，还没有充分了解新的社会制度下的客观规律，或者由于受到旧社会遗留下来的种种腐朽的思想作风的影响，而发生了种种缺点和错误，对于这些缺点和错误，感到不满意是应当的。从左面来同这种缺点和错误做斗争，就是以巩固社会主义制度、加强人民民主专政、加强共产党在社会主义建设中的领导核心作用为目的的批评和自我批评。这种从左面来的批评是我们广大人民的社会主义积极性的表现。
    还依恋于资本主义制度的人，还不愿意放弃剥削阶级的生活方式的人，对于当前社会生活的许多方面感到不满，而且很强烈的不满，这也是完全可以理解的。这是从右面来的不满。许多事情不能使从右面来的人感到满意，并不是由于我们的社会主义制度还处于刚刚建立起来的阶段，因而显出了某些幼稚和不成熟的状况，而是因为我们居然已经在基本上建立了社会主义制度；并不是由于这个新社会还不免保留
  “其所由脱胎出来的旧社会的痕迹”，而是因为这已经是在原则上不同于旧社会的一个崭新的社会；也不是由于我们在工作中还有不少缺点和错误，而是因为虽然有这些缺点和错误，但是我们已经在建设新社会中取得了伟大的成就。从右面来同我们的缺点和错误做斗争，其实是利用这种缺点和错误来反对社会主义，它所指向的目标乃是退回到资本主义去，退回到少数特权者压迫多数人的社会去。
    一个是拥护社会主义的立场，一个是反对社会主义的立场。这里的区别本来是很明显的。但因为从这两种不同的立场出发的不满和批评有时似乎针对着同一的现象，在这时候，有些人就感到不易区别了。例如对于在民主集中制下的某些不必要的过多的集中的现象，我们提出批评，我们坚决维护为建设社会主义所必要的集中而在此前提下主张扩大民主。可是有人却认为，既然过多的集中不好，那就根本不要集中。他们事实上是从资产阶级民主观点出发来反对社会主义的民主集中制，这是从右面来的批评。从右面来的批评常常用这种方法来造成混淆。有些对于某种不好的现象怀有正当的不满，但同时对于自己应该站在什么立场上还不够明确的人，就往往会被从右面来的批评所迷惑。
    我们反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，因为这些坏思想坏作风是同建设社会主义的要求不相容的，是同在共产党领导下团结六亿人民共同奋斗的要求不相容的。社会主义不是在什么绝对纯洁的“天国”里建设起来的，这里有种种污秽的垃圾并不是什么奇怪的事。我们深信社会主义制度本身具有战胜官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的力量，我们坚定地把社会主义建设向前推进，不断地同在工作干部中的一切足以损害社会主义事业的坏思想、坏作风斗争。
    从右面来反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的人，把自己打扮成是“反三害”的彻底而坚决的战士。他们反对得甚至比我们“彻底”得多呢！他们是这样地“彻底”，以至于他们不能忍受任何一句赞美社会主义制度的好话，因为据说，说一句好话，就会妨害对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的斗争。他们是这样地“彻底”，以至于他们认为，在社会主义制度下还存在着的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义要比一切坏东西更坏，所以“官僚主义比资本主义更坏”。他们是这样地“彻底”，以至于他们认为必须断定，既然在这个新的社会制度下还有官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，就应当抛弃这个社会制度。
    所以对于“不满”必须分析。事实上，有种种不同的不满，而这里所说的左面和右面的区别是最带根本性的区别。
    既然有这样两种不同性质的不满，两种不同立场的批评，那么应当怎么样呢？我想，应当这样：
    第一，不要因为有从右面来的批评就不敢从左面来进行批评；
    第二，必须严格地区别从左面来的批评和从右面来的批评，揭露从右面来的批评的真面目，不让右面来的声音混淆我们的方向；
    第三，但也不妨听听从右面来的声音，只要我们自己立定脚跟，从右面来的声音也可以让我们学到点东西，使我们更聪敏一些。
    对于不满的分析，除了来自左面的和来自右面的区别以外，还有一个问题需要谈一下，这就是从实际出发的问题。
    不真正接触实际，也不企图真正了解实际生活中的复杂内容，是很容易这也不满，那也不满的。为什么不满？因为他脑子里有一个极端“圆满”而“美好”的图案，这个图案不是从现实中来的，现实生活也永远不会完全符合于他的图案。
    要求从实际出发，并不是要人安于现状，不是要人承认实际存在着的一切都是绝对合理的，都是不可改变的。马克思主义要求客观地全面地了解事实，研究事实，掌握客观的规律，根据客观规律来看出何者应兴，何者应革，如何兴，如何革。马克思主义者是最尊重客观事实的人，同时又是最不怕变动，最敢于，也最善于进行变革，推动社会前进的人。不认真地看实际生活的人，虽然好像有什么美好的理想，但从他们的虚构的理想出发，除了得到对现实的不满以外，是什么结果也没有的。因为不能拉着自己的头发升空而愤懑，因为现实生活并不像“天国”中的“乐园”一样而不平的人，并不是无产阶级的革命家，不过是小资产阶级的空想家。
    饭是要一口一口吃的，路是要一步一步走的。因为才只走了几步，前面路还长而不满足，要继续走下去，这是好的。如果因为不能一步跨到将来，硬要拿将来的远景衡量今天的事情，于是愤愤不平，这难道有什么意义么？大家知道，如果用现代的标准来看过去时代的人类文化，认为一切都是荒谬无稽，这叫做反历史主义。那么，一个人生活在现实中，却用他所设想的将来社会中的标准来看现在的生活，对一切表示不满，这叫做什么呢？大概可以叫做反现实主义。
    对我们工作中存在着的缺点和错误应当不满意，但是在这里也有是不是从实际出发的问题。真正从实际出发，人们就能够恰当地估计这些缺点和错误，看出它们产生的根源，从而找到克服它们的途径。反之，不从实际出发的人，对于这些缺点和错误，虽然好像是深恶痛绝，但是并不了解。这些缺点和错误，对于他们是不可理解的怪物，从而也成为不可克服的东西。
    从一种虚构的幻想和脱离实际的主观愿望出发，而对现实生活表示不满，这种情形在有些青年知识分子中常常会发生。由于缺少社会生活的实际知识，缺少阶级斗争的经验，他们有这种缺点是可以理解的。应当帮助青年人学会马克思主义的从实际出发的态度，使他们的求进取的可贵的热情建筑在承认社会客观规律的基础上面。
    还必须指出，是否从实际出发的问题，其实仍旧是同上面所说的左面和右面的区别相关联的。
    真正的左一定是从实际出发的：要向前看，同时不脱离当前的实际。那么，从虚构的图案出发来提出种种不满的人是右还是左呢？说他是右，他大约是不肯心服的。他总想使人相信他决不是向后看的右，而是向前看的左。但是要知道，不能真正看清楚现实生活的人也一定是看不见真正的将来的。他所看到的不过是他自己制造的幻境。他既然不是依据生活发展的客观规律，他就只能是从个人利益出发来虚构他的美好的幻境；而在知识分子中间有很深影响的资产阶级思想观点就在这种情形下很自然地成为他的依据。用自由来反对任何集中的人，自以为提出了比民主集中制更远大的“理想”，其实不过是接受了关于个人自由的资产阶级观点。凭借这样的“理想”来对社会主义的现实表示不满，这难道可以叫做左么？
    所以脱离实际，要求一步登天的想法，貌似很左，其实是必须加上引号的“左”，这种“左”是很容易引导到右去的。鲁迅曾经说过：“关在房子里，最容易高谈彻底的主义，然而也最容易右倾”。“倘不明白革命的实际情形，也容易变成‘右翼’”（见“二心集”）。鲁迅讲的是三十年前国内阶级斗争十分激烈的时期的情形，但这话对于今天仍旧是适用的。
    因为一些缺点而否定一切，这看来是很“彻底”了，但这一来，恰恰“彻底”到了反对社会主义、企图退回资本主义去的右翼阵营里去了。这里仍然可以借用鲁迅的话：“倘说，凡大队的革命军，必须一切战士的意识，都十分正确，分明，这才是真的革命军，否则不值一哂。这言论，初看固然是很正当，彻底似的，然而这是不可能的难题，是空洞的高谈，是毒害革命的甜药。”鲁迅认为，这种高谈阔论的“貌似彻底的革命者”，其实呢，恰恰是“极不革命或有害革命的个人主义的论客”（见同上）。
    既然“左”可以引导到右，所以自觉地从右出发的不满往往也利用“左”的形式来俘虏那些“关在房子里的高谈彻底的主义”的人。前面我们也已经说到，右派分子有时这样表示，好像他们并不是不要社会主义，只是因为他们太痛恨官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义了，以至他们宁愿抛掉社会主义。他们反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义是反对得这样地“彻底”、这样地“左”，——右的声音和“左”的声音也就这样地混合到一起去了。
