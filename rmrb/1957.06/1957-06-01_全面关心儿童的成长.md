Comprehensively Caring for Children's Growth

    Over the past year, our country's work in protecting children has achieved new successes. Elementary education, nurseries, and kindergartens have greatly developed. 64.7% of school-age children nationwide are now enrolled in elementary schools, and approximately seven million urban and rural children are receiving care and education from childcare organizations. Children's healthcare has been further improved. Many extra-curricular educational institutions have been established across the country, and the number of Young Pioneers has increased to thirty million. All sectors of society are paying more attention to the care and education of children than ever before, and caring for and educating children has gradually become a new social custom. Under the care of all sectors of society, children are growing up healthily like young seedlings.
    Children are the future builders of socialist society. Families, preschool educational institutions, schools, the Young Pioneers, and all other parties should cooperate closely to comprehensively care for children's growth. We should not only care about the development of children's intelligence and physical strength, but also about the development of children's morality, educating children to love labor and cultivating their excellent qualities of diligence and thrift. From a very young age, children are interested in all kinds of labor around them and are willing to follow adults in labor in family life. And labor plays a huge role in the physical development of the new generation and the formation of their overall moral character, will, and personality. Therefore, before children enter school, families should educate children about labor, allowing them to engage in labor within their capacity, such as cleaning the yard, washing clothes, cooking, washing dishes, sewing, etc., to cultivate children's ability to live independently.
    However, at present, many schools and parents often only pay attention to children's knowledge education, and do not pay attention to or rarely pay attention to cultivating children's labor habits. Some parents still retain the idea of ​​despising physical labor and are unwilling to let their children engage in physical labor. This is most obvious in the issue of children's enrollment and further education. In particular, some senior staff members of state organs take too much care of their children in life, making them spoiled, lazy, and averse to work. Some institutions' nurseries and infant rooms have excessively high living standards. This phenomenon is not good and should be changed. We know that children receive their initial education in the family, and some of the characteristics of children's behavior when they enter school are influenced by the family and preschool educational institutions. Therefore, families and preschool educational institutions should pay attention to cultivating children's labor habits and establishing children's concept of loving labor and respecting manual laborers from childhood. In particular, Party and state workers, while responding to the call of the Party Central Committee to participate in physical labor, should also give their children a good education and influence through their own exemplary work attitude and the fine style of hard work and simplicity in their daily family life.
    In recent years, elementary schools have added handicraft labor courses, and through science and technology activities, they have enabled children to learn and master some production skills. In particular, the "Small Five-Year Plan" activities for children launched nationwide have greatly stimulated children's patriotic enthusiasm and encouraged children to actively participate in labor, achieving great results. For example, last year, the children in Linqu County, Shandong Province, established 145 youth forests and planted more than 351,000 trees. Before and after last year's "June 1st," the children in Chongqing collected more than 447,000 kilograms of scrap metal, which was used by steel mills to refine six furnaces of "Youth Steel." This kind of activity, which is beneficial to the physical and mental health of children, not only cultivates children's morality of loving labor and caring for public property, but is also beneficial to the country. This kind of activity should continue to be carried out nationwide. The Young Pioneers in schools should continue to strengthen labor education for children, pay more attention to organizing social public welfare labor and craft activities that meet children's physical conditions, and explain to children the difficulties of revolution and construction through various methods that children are willing to accept, and study the spirit of hard struggle of revolutionary predecessors. Schools and the Young Pioneers should educate children in the spirit of communism, fight against all phenomena that endanger children's physical and mental health, and cultivate them into a new generation that is healthy, lively, brave, honest, and has a creative spirit.
    Moral education for children has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. Social figures in many areas have organized mass-based extra-curricular education committees and family learning groups, many parents serve as after-school tutors for children, and many cultural and entertainment venues have added children's activity venues. This has played a positive role in enriching children's after-school life and in children's education. However, in the past, ideological education in schools was relatively weak, and some parents pushed all the responsibility of educating their children to the school and were indifferent to their children's behavior. Many schools implemented a two-shift system, and children spent a long time outside of school. Extra-curricular educational institutions could not meet the needs of children, and schools' after-school tutoring for students was relatively weakened, so some children developed some bad habits outside of school. Schools should strengthen students' extracurricular and after-school tutoring work, and families and all sectors of society should create conditions for children to learn and live. In particular, parents and all sectors of society should provide more help to those school-age children who cannot temporarily enroll in school and children who are in two-shift classes and spend half a day outside of school.
    In order to provide children with better living and learning conditions, we should continue to give play to the strength of social organizations and mass collectives and run schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and extra-curricular educational institutions diligently and thriftily in accordance with the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. At the same time, we should make full use of existing equipment and adult cultural and entertainment venues to hold various educational cultural and entertainment activities for children as much as possible. Educating children is the responsibility of the entire society. We should pool our wisdom and efforts and rely on the strength of the masses to run some welfare and educational undertakings for children. According to past experience, as long as the principles are clearly explained to the masses, the masses are willing to contribute money and effort to run these undertakings for the healthy growth of their children. For example, the families of many workers and staff members in industrial and mining enterprises have organized various forms of nurseries, kindergartens, children's clubs, primary school student self-study groups, and summer children's paradises. Nurseries and kindergartens run by workers' and staff members' families alone totaled 1,774 by the end of 1956, taking care of 91,830 children, accounting for more than 37% of the total number of children cared for by nurseries and kindergartens run by factories and mines. At the same time, nurseries and other facilities run by the masses generally cost less money and meet the needs of the masses. The houses of the Gonghe Street Workers' Nursery in Anshan City were built by the families of workers and staff members using waste materials and spending their Sunday rest time doing voluntary labor. Everyone should welcome this kind of thing. We hope that all sectors of society will work together to comprehensively care for children's lives and learning, so that children can grow up healthily in body and mind.

### 全面关心儿童的成长

    全面关心儿童的成长
    过去一年，我国保卫儿童工作取得了新的成就。小学教育、托儿所和幼儿园有了很大发展，全国学龄儿童已有64.7％进入小学，大约有七百万的城乡儿童受到托儿组织的保护和教养，儿童保健工作有了进一步改善，全国设立了许多校外教育机关，少年先锋队队员已经增加到三千万人，社会各个方面对于少年儿童的关怀和教育比以往更为重视，关怀和教育儿童已经逐渐成为新社会的风尚。儿童在社会各方面的关怀下，如同幼苗一样茁壮地成长起来。
    儿童是社会主义社会未来的建设者。家庭、学前教育机关、学校、少年先锋队等各个方面应当密切配合，全面地关心儿童的成长。我们不仅应当关心儿童智力、体力的发育，而且应当关心儿童品德的发育，教育儿童热爱劳动，培养儿童勤劳俭朴的优良品质。儿童从很小的时候起，对周围的各式各样的劳动发生兴趣，而且愿意在家庭生活中跟着成人劳动。而劳动对于新的一代体力的发育和整个道德面貌、意志、性格的形成起着极大的作用。因此，在儿童未入学以前，家庭就应当对儿童进行劳动教育，让他们从事力所能及的劳动，如打扫庭院、洗衣服、做饭、洗碗筷、缝补等等，以培养儿童独立生活的能力。
    但是，目前许多学校和父母往往只注意儿童的知识教育，不注意或很少注意培养儿童的劳动习惯。有些家长还残存着轻视体力劳动的思想，不愿意让自己的子女从事体力劳动。这表现在对于子女入学和升学问题上最为明显。特别是有些国家机关的高级工作人员对于子女在生活上照顾过多，使子女娇生惯养，好逸恶劳。有些机关的托儿所、乳儿室生活标准过高。这种现象是不好的，应当改变。我们知道，儿童在家庭就受到最初的教育，儿童在入学时候的操行上的某些特征，是受到家庭和学前教育机关的影响的。因此，家庭、学前教育机关，从儿童的幼年起，就应当注意培养儿童的劳动习惯，树立儿童热爱劳动和尊重体力劳动者的观念，特别是党和国家的工作人员，在响应党中央号召参加体力劳动的同时，也要在家庭的日常生活当中，以自己模范的劳动态度、艰苦朴素的优良作风，给子女以良好的教育和影响。
    近几年小学里增设了手工劳动课，并且通过科学技术活动，使少年儿童学习和掌握了一些生产技能，特别是在全国范围内展开的少年儿童的“小五年计划”活动，对于激发儿童的爱国热情，鼓舞儿童积极参加劳动，收到了很大效果。例如山东临朐县少年儿童去年建立了一百四十五个少年林，植树三十五万一千多棵。重庆少年儿童在去年“六一”前后收集了废金属四十四万七千多斤，钢铁厂用它炼出了六炉“少年钢”。这种有益于少年儿童身心健康的活动，既培养了儿童热爱劳动、爱护公物的品德，对国家也有好处。这种活动，应当在全国范围内继续展开。学校少年先锋队应当继续加强对少年儿童的劳动教育，应当更加注意组织符合儿童体力条件的社会公益劳动和工艺活动，并且通过儿童乐于接受的各种方式，向儿童讲解革命和建设的艰难困苦，学习革命先辈艰苦奋斗的精神。学校和少年先锋队应该以共产主义精神教育儿童，向一切危害儿童身心健康的现象作斗争，培养他们成为健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实和具有创造精神的新一代。
    对于少年儿童的品德教育，已经引起社会各方面的重视。不少地区的社会人士组织了群众性的校外教育委员会、家庭学习小组，许多家长担任少年儿童学习辅导员，许多文化娱乐场所增辟了儿童活动场地。这对于丰富儿童的校外生活，对于儿童的教育起了积极的作用。但是，过去，学校思想教育工作比较薄弱，有些家长把教育子女的责任全部推给学校，对子女的品行漫不经心。许多学校实行二部制，儿童在校外生活时间很长，校外教育机关不能满足儿童的需要，学校对于学生的校外辅导也相对地减弱，因而有些儿童在校外沾染上一些不好的习惯。学校应该加强学生的课外、校外辅导工作，家庭、社会各方面要给儿童创造学习和生活的条件。特别是对那些暂时不能入学的适龄儿童和进二部制班级半天在校外的儿童，家长和社会各个方面要给以更多的帮助。
    为了给儿童提供较好的生活和学习条件，我们应当根据勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，继续发挥社会团体和群众集体的力量，勤俭办学校、幼儿园、托儿所和校外教育机关；同时尽可能利用现有设备，利用成人文化娱乐场所，为儿童举办各种有教育意义的文化娱乐活动。教育儿童是整个社会的责任，应当群策群力，依靠群众自己的力量为儿童举办一些福利和教育事业。根据过去的经验，只要向群众讲清楚道理，群众为了自己子女健康地成长是愿意出钱出力举办这些事业的。例如许多工矿企业职工家属举办了多种形式的托儿站、幼儿园、儿童会、小学生自习小组、暑期儿童乐园等。仅职工家属举办的托儿站、幼儿园，到1956年年底统计就有一千七百七十四处，收托儿童九万一千八百三十人，占厂矿行政举办的托儿所、幼儿园收托儿童总数的37％强。同时，群众举办托儿站等一般地是花钱少，适合群众的需要。鞍山市共和街职工托儿所的房子，是职工家属利用废料，利用星期日休息时间，进行义务劳动兴建的。这类事情人人都应该欢迎。我们希望社会各个方面共同努力，全面关心儿童的生活和学习，使儿童的身心健康地成长起来。
