    Correcting Phenomena of Meetings Not Being Held on Schedule and Meetings Being Held Hastily
    Guangdong Improves People's Representative Conference System
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 1st – After the counties and cities of Guangdong Province corrected the past phenomena of not holding People's Representative Conference meetings and People's Committee meetings on schedule this year, the connection between the government and the people has become closer than before.
    All one hundred and fourteen counties and cities in the province have generally held the first meeting of the second People's Representative Conference this year. The People's Committee meetings of various counties and cities have also been held three to five times in the past few months. In the past two years, most counties and cities in Guangdong Province held People's Representative Conference meetings only once a year, and some did not hold them at all; county and city People's Committees also rarely convened. This violation of the legal system was corrected last year after the Provincial People's Committee conducted inspections and urged the counties and cities to improve.
    This year, the counties and cities also corrected some of the hasty practices of the past when holding People's Representative Conference meetings and People's Committee meetings. Now, major issues are being seriously discussed at the meetings, and many representatives are criticizing the shortcomings in the government's work. When Panyu, Zhuhai and other counties held People's Representative Conference meetings, many representatives pointed out that the leading cadres' past bureaucratic and subjectivist work style in guiding production promoted and abetted the coercive and commanding practices of lower-level cadres, causing the government to be seriously divorced from the masses. The meetings also made resolutions based on the criticisms, stating that government workers must quickly go deep among the masses in the future to listen to the people's opinions.
    Before the meetings, many county and city people's representatives went deep into the masses to collect proposals. Most of these proposals were handled at the meetings, and some that should and could be handled were immediately handed over to the relevant departments for execution.

    纠正了不按期开会和开会草率的现象
    广东健全各级人民代表会议制度
    新华社广州1日电　广东省各县、市今年纠正了过去不按期召开人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议的现象后，政府和人民的联系比以前密切了。
    全省一百十四个县、市，今年已经普遍召开了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。各县、市的人民委员会会议，今年这几个月内也大都开过三次到五次。而在过去两年中，广东省大部分县、市的人民代表大会会议每年只开一次，有的甚至一次都不举行；县、市人民委员会也很少召开。这种违反法制的现象，去年由省人民委员会对各县、市进行检查督促后才纠正。
    今年各县、市在举行人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议时，还纠正了过去开会时某些草率从事的现象。现在，重大问题大都在会议上进行认真的讨论，许多代表对政府工作中的缺点提出批评。番禺、珠海等县举行人民代表大会会议时，许多代表指出领导干部过去在指导生产上的官僚主义、主观主义作风，促成和助长了下级干部的强迫命令的作法，使政府严重地脱离群众。会议并且根据批评意见作出政府工作人员今后必须迅速深入群众中听取人民意见的决议。
    许多县、市的人民代表在开会以前，分别深入到群众中收集提案。这些提案大都在会议上得到处理，有些应办可办的事情当时就交给有关部门执行。
