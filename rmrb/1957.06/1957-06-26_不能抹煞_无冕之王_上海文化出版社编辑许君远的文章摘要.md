What Is Being Said

　　The "Uncrowned King" Should Not Be Erased
    Article Abstract by Xu Junyuan, Editor of Shanghai Culture Publishing House
    The newspaper editors' rules and regulations are probably very strict. Comrade Wen Mu wants to fight for the status of journalists, and my journalist status reminds me of the "uncrowned king" of the past. When editor comrades see this term, they immediately feel that it is related to the bourgeois newspaper ideology, and it is better not to publish it. If the rigid rules and regulations continue to plague us, how can we "let go" thoroughly? How can we "let go" widely? Today, when we are striving to "let go" well all over the country, shouldn't the mentality of fearing poisonous weeds and even being unwilling to let wild grass and idle flowers grow be changed? But most of the Party newspapers still wear a "Party member face" without a smile. Is this the necessary style of a Party newspaper? Everyone is shouting to "tear down the walls," but the Party newspaper still wants to build a fortress and isolate itself. If this continues, how can it guide the unity work between Party members and non-Party members? Therefore, I suggest that the Party newspaper should broaden its standards in selecting news and take the lead. Sticking to old ways and falling behind other newspapers is not a good idea.
    I feel that after liberation, newspaper offices have become institutionalized, and news practitioners are no different from ordinary cadres in institutions. Especially the field staff, they have already taken off the "uncrowned king" hat, and no longer need to rack their brains, make friends widely, and arrange news clues. A public letter from the newspaper has a greater effect than the journalist's private card in the past. In the old society, there were many scoundrels in the press. News was
  “fabricated,” reports were “fabricated,” bribes were taken openly, and blackmail was done secretly. A history of "reporters" could be written about these scandals. However, many of them were self-reliant and earned their living by their own abilities. Over time, they all developed a grand demeanor, striding into the doors of "big shots," and the big shots were happy to associate with them. In this way, their interviewing work was always successful, and they could even figure out the whole story behind the news. The news reporters of New China must be responsible to the people and to the socialist cause, which is correct. But is it enough to only talk about "responsibility"? I think it is unfair to erase the strengths of the "uncrowned king" in the old society in one stroke. 　　　　        (Excerpt from Wenhui Daily, May 21)

### 不能抹煞“无冕之王”  上海文化出版社编辑许君远的文章摘要

　　不能抹煞“无冕之王”
    上海文化出版社编辑许君远的文章摘要
    报纸编辑的清规戒律恐怕也很严重。文木同志要为记者争地位，我由记者地位联系到过去的“无冕之王”。编辑同志见了这个名词，立即觉得它与资产阶级办报思想有关，还是不登为妙。如果清规戒律继续作祟，如何能“放”得透？“放”得广？在全国各地争取在要放得好的今天，害怕毒草甚至也不愿让野草闲花滋蔓的心情应该有所改变了吧？但是大部分的党报还在摆着“党员面孔”，没有笑容，难道这就是党报必备的风格吗？大家都在喊叫“拆墙”，党报还想筑寨自固，长此以往，如何指导党与非党同志的团结工作？因此我建议，在选择新闻上，党报的尺度应该更放宽些，起个带头作用。故步自封，落在其他报纸后面，并非上计。
    我感到解放后报馆机关化，新闻从业人员与一般机关干部没有什么差别。特别是外勤，早已摘掉了那顶“无冕之王”的帽子，再也不必挖空心思，广结善缘，布置新闻线索。报社的一纸公函，效果比过去的记者私人卡片要来得大。在旧社会里，新闻界的败类很多，消息
  “客里空”，报道“莫须有”，公开受贿，秘密敲诈，丑行可写一部“报人外史”。但是其中不少人硜硜自守，凭自己的能力吃饭。日久天长，他们都有一种恢宏的气度，昂首阔步出入于“大人先生”之门，而大人先生也乐与他们交往。这样，他们的采访工作便无往不利，甚至对新闻幕后的来龙去脉也能摸个清清楚楚。新中国的新闻记者要对人民负责，对社会主义事业负责，这是对的。但是只谈“负责”就够了吗？把旧社会“无冕之王”的特长一笔抹杀，我认为不够公道。　　　　        （摘自5月21日文汇报）
