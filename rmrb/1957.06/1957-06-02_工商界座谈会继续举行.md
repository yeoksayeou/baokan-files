    Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium Continues

    (Our Newspaper) The symposium of industrial and commercial circles convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its fourteenth session yesterday. Speakers at the meeting included Yao Huiquan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Maimaiti Niyazi Harez, Chairman of the Xinjiang Federation of Industry and Commerce; Lu Dinghua, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; Cheng Shengsan, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (Standing Committee Member of the Jilin Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce); Tong Quanru, Deputy Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; Tian Yupupu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce; Su Xianqin, Secretary-General of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce; Wu Bingjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce (Tian Yupupu, Su Xianqin, and Wu Bingjun spoke jointly); Nie Xulun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Zhang Zhihong, Deputy Manager of Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Manufacturing Company.

    Yao Huiquan Criticizes Shortcomings in Factory Relocation Work

    Yao Huiquan disagreed with extending fixed interest for twenty years and withdrawing public representatives. At the same time, he criticized certain shortcomings in the work.

    He believes that there are also many shortcomings in factory relocation. In some cases, the mobilization was presented very attractively, but the results were largely unfulfilled, causing private personnel and workers to feel insecure. In some cases, there was no good consultation with the workers beforehand, and temporary mandatory orders were issued, resulting in problems with supply, production, sales, and the lives of workers after the factory was relocated. He said: In the face of the country's many achievements, everyone trusts the Communist Party, but if certain shortcomings in the work are not corrected in time, they will affect the Party's prestige and even make some people doubt the superiority of socialism.

    Maimaiti Niyazi Harez said: Some Han Chinese Leading Cadres Discriminate Against Minority Ethnic Workers

    Maimaiti Niyazi Harez said: Like other parts of the country, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the first half of 1956. Most industrialists and businessmen in our autonomous region welcome the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, but there are also many problems.

    First, the relationship between public and private partners is generally good in our autonomous region. However, some public representatives only know theory and do not understand the business. They look down on private personnel and do not trust them, causing some private personnel to suspect whether they will be squeezed out in the future. In some enterprises, public representatives treat workers and private personnel unequally, only taking care of the workers and suppressing the opinions of private personnel. There are also some inappropriate arrangements for the work of private personnel. For example, people who have been selling goods at the counter for a long time have been assigned to barbershops. Those with large families whose wages cannot sustain their lives have not been taken care of.

    Second, because Xinjiang is an ethnic minority area, the ethnicities in the enterprises are very complex, which requires special attention. However, some Han Chinese leading cadres in the enterprises have Han chauvinistic ideas and discriminate against minority ethnic workers. Abulizi Musa Bayev said: The public manager and the private manager are the same in name, but in reality, the public manager monopolizes power and handles everything; the instructions of the ethnic minority manager may not be accepted by the section chief and general cadres. The public representative pays close attention to improving the skills of Han Chinese workers, but does not pay attention to the training of minority ethnic workers. The family members of Han Chinese workers can be arranged for work, but the family members of minority ethnic groups with considerable knowledge are not arranged. Rancher Wang (Han Chinese) even asked the herders to pour the stool and urine for his children, and his accountant (Han Chinese) scolded the herders. He hopes that the United Front Work Department will send people to go deep into the grassroots, fully understand the situation, and correctly resolve the existing contradictions.

    Lu Dinghua said: The Relationship Between Public and Private is a Relationship of Leadership and Being Led

    Lu Dinghua said that the private side should recognize that the relationship between public and private is a relationship of leadership and being led. He said that after joint ownership, capitalists still have a negative side. Some people have a sense of inferiority, believing that their class is not good, their theory is not high, and they are hesitant in their work. I myself have been discriminated against. For example, the gatekeeper does not check the workers when they go out, but the manager is checked when he goes out, which puts a burden on my mind. Some people have quite serious bourgeois ideas. For example, an industrialist and businessman in Luoyang originally had more than 60,000 yuan of shares. He heard that households with shares below 2,000 yuan could be treated according to the welfare benefits of enterprise employees in case of birth, old age, illness, and death. So, he changed his shares to below 2,000 yuan under several names. This is a manifestation of duality.

    He believes that having authority and responsibility is an important link in improving the relationship between public and private. He said that after joint ownership, the work arrangements are meticulous, but most of them are nominal, like the "Monkey King."

    In addition, he also talked about some problems in the relocation of factories. He said that when some people went to Shanghai and Guangzhou to mobilize internal relocation, they made very big promises, saying that there would be no problem with factory construction, raw materials, wages, welfare, accommodation, travel expenses, personnel arrangements, and children's schooling, but none of them could be realized. The private side is uneasy, and the situation is quite serious now. He suggests that the government deal with it.

    He also expressed disagreement with withdrawing public representatives and the Party secretary-generals of the Federations of Industry and Commerce, and he also disagreed with fixing interest for twenty years. He also criticized the county-level cadres for not paying attention to the democratic parties.

    Cheng Shengsan said: Improving Public-Private Relations Requires Establishing Certain Systems

    Cheng Shengsan said that the relationship between public and private partners in Jilin Province is basically good, but there are also some problems. Most of the public side accommodates the private side in everything, provides little political help, and a few have factionalism and act arbitrarily. Private personnel have a serious sense of class inferiority, thinking that they are the class being transformed, and they are cautious everywhere. In their work, they dare not lead the workers, dare not take responsibility, and dare not criticize the public side. He believes that to solve this problem, in addition to strengthening the education of the united front policy and the redemption policy for workers, and strengthening the education of political theory and business knowledge for the private side, it is also necessary to establish certain systems in the enterprise to achieve collective leadership, clear division of labor, learning from each other's strengths, and mutual assistance.

    He believes that public representatives play an important role in joint ventures and cannot be withdrawn.

    Tong Quanru Suggests Cultivating a Magnanimous Political Demeanor Among Party Members and Cadres Through Rectification

    Tong Quanru said: From an economic point of view, the Chinese national bourgeoisie is no longer a complete class, because the right to use the enterprise has been completely handed over to the state, and the ownership has become symbolic and cannot be handled independently at all. Joint ventures are basically socialist enterprises. Therefore, he advocates only mentioning the relationship of public-private cooperation and co-management in joint ventures and not emphasizing class relations (of course, there are still class relations). This can eliminate the concerns of private personnel and further promote the enthusiasm of private personnel. He suggests that joint ventures with conditions can be gradually changed to state-owned or local state-owned enterprises; in these renamed enterprises, the withdrawal of public representatives can be tried.

    Finally, he suggested that the Party should pay attention to cultivating a magnanimous political demeanor among Party members and the vast number of cadres through this rectification movement. He said: It is inconceivable that a narrow-minded person can correctly handle contradictions among the people. He disagreed with the suggestion made by someone at the symposium of democratic figures to establish a committee to prevent retaliation, believing that it was a passive approach.

    Tian Yupupu et al. said: Mentioning Duality Hurts the Self-Esteem of the Industrial and Commercial Circles

    Tian Yupupu, Su Xianqin, and Wu Bingjun jointly stated that Qian Jiaju and Feng Hefa's speeches did not solve the problems that the masses wanted to know.

    The industrial and commercial circles were very moved when they heard Chairman Mao's personal experience explaining the need for continued transformation. However, they still have opinions on the duality theory of some theorists. First of all, the term duality seems very bad, as if a dual person is a "good and bad person," as if the negative side is "five poisons"; secondly, what some industrialists and businessmen do not accept is why an error committed by industrialists and businessmen is said to be duality, while errors committed by intellectuals and workers are not said to be duality? Third, the propaganda and education work of the Federations of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association always puts theory first and rarely combines it with specific people and specific facts to analyze it realistically. When people from the China Democratic National Construction Association speak, they always regard themselves as transformers, not standing among the masses, but standing above the masses. Therefore, the masses said: You yourselves have not yet understood, but you speak in a "understood" posture, how can the masses accept it?

    Seven or eight years after liberation, with the change of their economic status, industrialists and businessmen require those around them to give them a fair assessment. Chairman Mao said in "Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society" about duplicity, not duality. Are duplicity and duality the same? If duplicity can also explain the problem, can the term duality be changed to duplicity to show the different stages? So as not to make some people think of "five poisons" as soon as they hear the mention of duality.

    They hope that propaganda and education will not damage the self-esteem of the industrial and commercial circles. They said that in many newspapers, periodicals, and meetings, some people are accustomed to using the old methods to analyze how the bourgeoisie's duality is, but they do not treat the "narrow-mindedness" of intellectuals or the "selfishness" of peasants as duality. This intentionally or unintentionally hurts the self-esteem of the industrial and commercial circles.

    They disagree with extending the fixed interest rate for twenty years.

    Nie Xulun Suggests Not to Blame Each Other for "Labeling"

    Nie Xulun talked about three issues. First, the issue of "labeling." He said that this time, in helping the Party with rectification, we must adhere to the guidance of Chairman Mao and start from unity, go through criticism and self-criticism, and reach new unity on a new basis. In exposing problems, reflecting situations, and putting forward opinions, it is impossible to require everyone to have completely consistent views. Although it is "gentle breeze and fine rain," it is still "windy and rainy" after all, so it is natural to bring some criticism. Recently, at the symposium, some comrades accused each other of putting labels on themselves, believing that this is harmful to airing opinions and would increase the concerns of the speakers. I think this kind of accusation is unnecessary. If the size of the hat does not fit, it will definitely not fit. It is either too big or too small. If it is forced on, it does not look like it to others. It does not matter at all! If it fits, it is comfortable to wear, which is much better than catching a cold with a bare head. I suggest that in future symposiums, speakers should avoid "labeling" others as much as possible. Even if there are some shortcomings in wording, listeners should not regard criticism of themselves as "labeling." In this way, it will be beneficial to airing opinions and helping the Party with rectification.

    Second, the issue of duality. He disagrees with someone dividing activeness and passivity completely apart. He said that it is impossible for anyone to have only an active side, or only a passive side. It is only that everyone has different degrees, with more or less. Often, one is active in one thing, and passive in another; one is active today, and passive tomorrow; one is active in one part of the same thing, and passive in another. This often occurs when personal interests and collective interests conflict. Therefore, the advanced, intermediate, and backward elements in the industrial and commercial circles are not absolutely advanced and backward, but only different in degree. Even opium is a poison, but it also has its good side. It is an indispensable thing in medical treatment, so don't look at anything absolutely.

    Third, the issue of the evaluation of industrialists and businessmen. Comrade Feng Hefa mentioned in yesterday's speech: "The general capitalist loves the country, but does not necessarily love socialism, and may even be impossible to love socialism." I believe that capitalists not only can love socialism, but in fact, many industrialists and businessmen who love the cause of socialism have emerged, and more and more are emerging. We should not ignore the negative side of industrialists and businessmen, but we should also have a correct estimate of the positive side.

    Zhang Zhihong Believes that the General Spirit of Qian Jiaju's Speech is Acceptable, but Some Things are Incompatible with His Own Feelings

    Zhang Zhihong agrees with Feng Hefa's opinion on class relations: ideological contradictions are the main ones, and economic contradictions are secondary. He gave an example, saying: There is a comrade named Ni (industrialist and businessman) in the China Democratic National Construction Association. Before liberation, workers called him "Chilao" (a Shanghai swear word); after liberation, they called him boss; after joint ownership, they called him Manager Ni; now they call him Old Ni. This reflects the change in class relations.

    He believes that the general spirit of Qian Jiaju's speech is acceptable, but there are still some things that are incompatible with his own feelings. He believes that Qian Jiaju's views on industrialists and businessmen still remain in the "boss" stage. He said: Many of the contradictions reflected at the symposium cannot be said to be class relations. Some are party-masses relations, and some are due to bureaucracy. He said: "A small king before joint ownership, a minister of a large country after joint ownership, and a citizen of a perished country after merger" These words are actually self-deprecating by small households. It cannot be said that most industrialists and businessmen are like this. Most capitalists cherish the enterprise after merging into large enterprises. Citing individual examples cannot solve the problem. He believes that the views of some central theoretical experts on some issues still remain in the stage of the previous two years, and they cannot see the kind of change in that Mr. Ni. Emphasizing class relations one-sidedly will cover up the three major isms (bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism).

    工商界座谈会继续举行
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会，昨天举行第十四次座谈。会上发言的有民建会上海市委员会常委姚惠泉、新疆工商联主委买买堤尼牙孜哈热、河南省工商联主委鲁定华、全国工商联常委（吉林省工商联常委）成盛三、浙江省工商联副秘书长童泉如、天津市工商联副秘书长田玉璞、武汉市工商联秘书长苏先勤、北京市工商联副秘书长吴秉钧（田玉璞、苏先勤、吴秉钧三人是联合发言）、云南省工商联副秘书长聂叙伦、上海石油机械制造公司副经理章志鸿。
    姚惠泉批评工厂内迁工作的缺点
    姚惠泉不同意延长定息二十年，不同意撤出公方代表，同时，对工作中若干缺点提出批评。
    他认为工厂内迁的缺点也不少。有的在动员的时候，说得天花乱坠，结果大部落空，弄得私方人员和职工不安心工作。有的事前没有和职工很好协商，临时强迫命令，结果迁厂后供产销和职工生活都发生了问题。他说：在国家的许多成就面前，大家对共产党是信任的，但是若干工作中的缺点如不及时纠正，就会影响党的威信，甚至使某些人怀疑社会主义的优越性。
    买买堤尼牙孜哈热说：有的汉族领导干部歧视少数民族职工
    买买堤尼牙孜哈热说：新疆自治区与全国各地一样，在1956年上半年取得了私营工商业社会主义改造的决定性胜利。我们自治区的大部分工商业者对于党的和平改造的方针是欢迎的，但存在的问题也不少。
    第一、公私共事关系，在我们自治区基本上是好的。但是某些公方代表只知道理论，不懂业务，看不起私方人员，不信任他们，以致某些私方人员怀疑将来是否会把自己排挤出去。在部分企业中，公方代表对工人和私方人员不同等看待，只照顾工人，压制私方人员的意见。安排私方人员的工作，也有一些不恰当的地方。例如长期在柜台售货的被分到理发店去了。家庭人口多的，工资不能维持生活的，也没有得到照顾。
    第二、由于新疆是个民族地区，企业中的民族非常复杂，需要特别注意。但企业中有的汉族领导干部有大汉族主义思想，歧视少数民族职工。阿不力孜木沙巴也夫说：公方的经理和私方的经理在名义上一样，而实际上，公方经理独揽大权，包办一切；民族经理的指示，科长和一般干部不一定接受。公方代表对于提高汉族工人的技术很注意，对于少数民族工人的培养就不重视。汉族职工家属可以安排工作，而有相当学识的少数民族家属却不给安排。牧场王场长（汉族）甚至叫牧工给他小孩倒屎倒尿，他的会计（汉族）打骂过牧工。他希望统战部派人深入下层，全面了解情况，正确解决存在的矛盾。
    鲁定华说：公私关系是领导与被领导的关系
    鲁定华说，私方应认清公私关系是领导与被领导的关系。他说，合营后，资本家仍有消极的一面，有的人有一种自卑感，认为阶级不好，理论不高，工作缩手缩脚，我自己也受到过歧视，例如门警对工人出门不加检查，而经理出门却要检查，使我思想上背了包袱。有的人资产阶级思想相当严重，如洛阳有一个工商业者原来有六万多元股金，他听说两千元以下股金的户倘有生老病死，可按企业职工福利待遇处理，于是他化了若干名字，把他的股金改成了两千元以下。这就是两面性的表现。
    他认为有职有权是搞好公私关系的重要环节。他说，合营后，工作安排照顾是无微不至，但多数是有名无实，如“齐天大圣”一样。
    另外，他还谈到迁厂中的一些问题。他说，有些人到上海广州动员内迁时把愿许得很大，说什么建厂、原料、工资、福利、住宿、路费、人事安排、子弟上学等都不成问题，结果都不能实现。私方情绪不安，现在情况相当严重，建议政府处理。
    他还表示不同意撤出公方代表和工商联的党员秘书长，也不同意定息二十年。他还对县级干部不重视民主党派提出了批评。
    成盛三说：改善公私关系需要建立一定的制度
    成盛三说，吉林省的公私共事关系基本是好的，但也有一些问题。多数公方对私方遇事迁就，政治上帮助少，少数有宗派主义情绪、独断独行。私方人员有严重的阶级自卑感，以为自己是被改造的阶级，处处小心，在工作中一不敢领导职工，二不敢负责，三不敢批评公方。他认为要解决这个问题，除了对职工加强统战政策和赎买政策的教育，对私方加强政治理论和业务知识的教育以外，还需要在企业中建立一定的制度，做到集体领导、明确分工、取长补短、互相帮助。
    他认为公方代表在合营企业里有着重要的作用，不能撤去。
    童泉如建议通过整风，培养党员、干部宽宏大量的政治风度
    童泉如说：中国民族资产阶级从经济上看，已经不是一个完整的阶级，因为对企业的使用权已完全交给了国家，所有权也成了象征性的，根本不能自行处理，合营企业基本上是社会主义性质的企业，因此，他主张在合营企业内只提公私合作共事关系，不要去强调阶级关系（当然还有阶级关系）。这样可以消除私方人员的顾虑，进一步发挥私方人员的积极性。他建议有条件的合营企业可逐步改为国营或地方国营；在这些已改名的企业中，可以试行撤出公方代表。
    最后，他建议党通过这次整风运动，注意培养党员和广大干部宽宏大量的政治风度。他说：不可设想，一个胸怀狭窄的人能够正确处理人民内部矛盾。他不同意民主人士座谈会上有人提出的成立一个委员会以防止打击报复的建议，他认为那是消极的办法。
    田玉璞等说：提两面性，损伤工商界的自尊心
    田玉璞、苏先勤、吴秉钧三人联合发言认为千家驹、冯和法的发言没有解决群众所要知道的问题。
    工商界听到毛主席以亲身体会说明需要继续改造时，很受感动，可是，他们对某些理论家关于两面性的说法还是有意见。首先，两面性这个名词看来很坏，好像两面性的人就是“好坏人”，好像消极的一面就是“五毒”行为；其次，某些工商业者不服气的是为什么工商业者犯个错误，就说是两面性，而知识界、工人犯了错误就不说两面性呢？第三，工商联、民建会的宣教工作，总是先摆理论，很少结合具体人具体事实事求是地分析。民建会的人讲话的时候总是以改造人自居，不是站在群众之中，而是站在群众之上。因此，群众说：你们自己还没通，就拿“通”的姿态讲话，群众怎么能接受呢。
    解放七、八年了，工商业者随着经济地位的改变，要求周围的人对他们给以恰如其分的估计。毛主席在“中国社会各阶级的分析”里说过二重性，没说两面性，二重性和两面性是否一样，如果用二重性也可以说明问题，可否把两面性这个名词改为二重性，以示阶段不同。免得一些人一听到提两面性，就想到“五毒”。
    他们希望宣传教育不要损伤工商界的自尊心。他们说很多报纸、刊物和会议，有些人习惯用老一套的方法分析资产阶级两面性如何如何，而对知识分子的“胸襟狭窄”，农民的“自私自利”，就不作为两面性。这就有意无意损伤了工商界的自尊心。
    他们不同意延长定息二十年的办法。
    聂叙伦建议不要互相指责“扣帽子”
    聂叙伦谈三个问题。第一、关于“扣帽子”的问题。他说，这次帮助党整风，必须本着毛主席所指导的，要从团结出发，经过批评与自我批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结。在揭露问题，反映情况，提出意见中，不可能要求大家的看法都完全一致，虽然是“和风细雨”，但究竟还是“有风有雨”，所以，带来一些批评也是很自然的。近来在座谈会上，有的同志互相指责对方扣自己的帽子，认为这对鸣放有害，会使发言人增加顾虑。我以为这种指责是不必要的，如果帽子的尺码不合，一定戴不上，不是大就是小，勉强戴上了，别人看着也不像，根本没有什么关系！要是合尺码的话，戴上也是舒服的，比光着头伤风感冒要好得多。我建议今后座谈时，发言的人应尽可能避免对别人“扣帽子”，即使有些措词上的缺点，听的人也不应该把对自己的批评看成是“扣帽子”。这样，对鸣放和帮助党整风才有好处。
    第二、关于两面性的问题。他不同意有人把积极性和消极性截然划分开。他说，任何一个人不可能只有积极的一面，或者是只有消极的一面，只能是各人程度不同，有多有少而已。常常是对甲事积极了，对乙事消极；今天积极了，明天消极；在同一事物中的某一部分积极，另一部分消极。这是在个人利益和集体利益发生矛盾的时候，经常出现的情况。因此在工商界中的先进、中间和落后的分子，不是绝对的先进和落后，只是程度上的区别而已，即如鸦片是毒品，但也有它好的一面，在医疗上是不可缺少的东西，所以对任何事物都不要看得绝对化。
    第三、关于工商业者的估价问题。冯和法同志在昨天的发言中提到：“一般的资本家爱国，不等于爱社会主义，甚至不可能爱社会主义”。我认为资本家不仅可能爱社会主义，事实上已经涌现了不少热爱社会主义事业的工商业者，而且越来越多。我们对工商业者消极的一面不应该忽视，但对积极的一面也应该有正确的估计。
    章志鸿认为千家驹发言总的精神是可以接受的，但是有一些东西与自己的感情格格不入
    章志鸿同意冯和法关于阶级关系的意见：思想矛盾是主要的，经济矛盾是次要的。他举了一个例子说：民建会有一个姓倪的同志（工商业者），解放前，工人称他“赤佬”（上海骂人的话）；解放后，称他老板；合营后，称他倪经理；现在叫他老倪了。这反映阶级关系的变化。
    他认为千家驹发言总的精神是可以接受的，但是还有一些东西与自己的感情格格不入。他认为千家驹对于工商业者的有些看法还停留在“老板”阶段。他说：座谈会上反映的很多矛盾，不能说都是阶级关系，有的是党群关系，有的是由于官僚主义。他说：“合营前小国之君，合营后大国之臣，合并后亡国之民”这些话，实际上是小户的自我讽刺，不能说大部分工商业者都如此。大部分资本家并到大企业后是爱护企业的。引证个别的例子不能解决问题。他认为中央的一些理论专家对一些问题的看法还停留在前两年的阶段，看不到姓倪的那种变化。一味强调阶级关系，这就会把三大主义（官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义）掩护起来。
