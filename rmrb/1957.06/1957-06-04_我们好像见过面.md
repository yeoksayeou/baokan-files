    "We Seem to Have Met Before"
    I've been in the Propaganda Department for almost two years, but our department head hasn't spoken a word to me yet! Once I attended a social gathering and met our Deputy Minister. He smiled and asked me, "We seem to have met before, what unit do you work in?" I was really puzzled when I heard that. I had to bite the bullet and reply to him, "Minister! I work in the Propaganda Department." In fact, just a few days ago, he raised his hand at the party member meeting to approve me becoming a probationary party member. (Xi'an, Wang Li)

    “我们好像见过面”
    我到宣传部快两年了，但是咱们的部首长还没和我说过话呢！有一次我去参加了一个联欢会，会见了我们的副部长，他微笑着问我：“我们好像见过面，你在哪个单位工作？”“我一听真纳闷。只好硬着头皮答复他：“部长！我就在宣传部工作。”其实，前些日子，他在党员大会上还举手同意我成为一个预备党员呢。　（西安　王力）
