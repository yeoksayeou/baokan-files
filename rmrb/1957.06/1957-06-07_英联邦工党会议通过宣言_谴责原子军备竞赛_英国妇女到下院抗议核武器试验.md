Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th. The Commonwealth Labour Parties' Conference unanimously adopted a declaration on the 4th condemning the "mad and suicidal arms race currently based on the so-called policy of atomic deterrence."

    The declaration "calls on all governments to take all possible actions to use the vast and terrible power of thermonuclear energy for peaceful purposes, for creating wealth for the common people of all countries."

    The declaration also states: "The root of the evil lies in the fundamental economic injustices that represent the interests of monopoly capitalism, which is single-mindedly trying to crush the development of democratic socialism."

    The conference called for self-determination for the people of Africa. The declaration said that undue delay in liberating the enslaved people of the world contains great dangers. Indochina, Cyprus, and Algeria offer lessons.

    The conference of representatives from Labour and Socialist parties of Commonwealth countries and British colonies has been held near Dorking, Surrey, since May 28th. Representatives from the Labour and Socialist parties of twenty-two countries attended the conference. The Socialist parties of India, Ceylon, Pakistan, and South Africa did not send representatives to the conference.

    The conference is scheduled to end on June 6th.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. London News: A large number of British women went to the House of Commons for the third consecutive evening on the 5th to meet with members of parliament to protest hydrogen bomb tests. Some of them have been going to the House of Commons every day for weeks to hold protest demonstrations.

    The Bishop of Chichester, speaking at the Central Hall in Brighton (Sussex), said he advocated an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. He called on Britain to show initiative on this issue.

    谴责原子军备竞赛
    英国妇女到下院抗议核武器试验
    据新华社伦敦6日电　英联邦各国工党会议4日一致通过了一项宣言，谴责“目前以所谓原子威慑政策为基础的、疯狂的、自杀性的军备竞赛”。
    宣言“要求各国政府采取一切可能的行动，把热核能的巨大而可怕的力量用于和平目的，用于为世界各国的普通人民创造财富。”
    宣言还说：“恶势力的根源在于经济方面根本的不公正现象，它们代表垄断资本主义的利益，而垄断资本主义则一心一意想粉碎民主社会主义的发展。”
    会议要求给予非洲人民自决权。宣言说，不适当地拖延不解放世界上被奴役的人民包含着巨大的危险。印度支那、塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚都提供了教训。
    英联邦各国和英殖民地工党、社会党代表会议5月28日起在萨利郡多尔金附近举行。参加会议的有二十二个国家的工党和社会党代表。印度、锡兰、巴基斯坦和南非的社会党没有代表参加会议。
    这次会议预定在6月6日结束。
