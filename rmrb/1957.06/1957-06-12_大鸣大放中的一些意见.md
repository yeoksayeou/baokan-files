Some Opinions from the Great Blooming and Contending
　　Chen Shihua, Vice President of Tsinghua University

　　After a short two-week trip abroad, I returned to find that the motherland had changed. All over the country, the Great Blooming and Contending was underway. Taking Tsinghua University, this small corner, as an example, although the scenery of "Shui Mu Tsinghua" remains the same, the various forms of wall posters and forums have created a new atmosphere in Tsinghua that I can hardly believe is the same homeland I left just two weeks ago. The exposure of the Party's shortcomings is becoming more and more thorough, and the criticism is becoming more and more profound. However, the relationship between the Party and the masses has not become estranged as a result; on the contrary, they are more united. This cannot but make people feel the correctness and brilliance of the Party's leadership. Many foreign friends attach great importance to our Party's "blooming and contending" policy and this rectification movement, and are eager to read the full text of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. In Prague, a friend even said to me: "Don't think that Mao Zedong belongs only to you Chinese people."

　　Some say that the current "blooming and contending" is not enough. I believe that "enough" or "not enough" is relative. To make an estimate, there must be a standard of measurement, and the formula of unity—criticism—unity may be the most appropriate standard. The result of the measurement is that there is indeed a sense of inadequacy, that is, not enough seriousness and earnestness, and not enough gentle breeze and fine rain. Of course, some people also have concerns and cannot "know everything and say everything"; and some people do not quite believe in the Party's policies, thinking that even if the Party is allowed to speak out, it may not be able to correct its mistakes, so they are unwilling to speak out. But on the other hand, it is felt that the "blooming and contending" is somewhat excessive, and has even gone beyond the scope of socialism. For example, when it is mentioned that there is a wall between the Party and non-Party members, there is a fear that the wall is not thick enough; when it is mentioned that there is a ditch between the Party and non-Party members, there is a fear that the ditch is not deep enough. Of course, it is necessary to illustrate the thickness of the wall and the depth of the ditch, but the main question is how to tear down the wall and fill in the ditch. "Achievements are primary" cannot be said; "The relationship between the Party and non-Party members is basically normal" cannot be said. Of course, it cannot be denied that individual Party members or individual Party organizations have subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and that there are shortcomings and errors. But precisely because of this, the Party has launched this great rectification movement and called for the help of non-Party members. This is the highest manifestation of democracy and freedom in our country. This requires us to be calm, use our brains, think of ways, start from the desire for unity, and, with the aim of "curing the sickness to save the patient," conduct comrade-like criticism of the Party to make the Party's internal rectification more thorough and successful. It should not be an opportunity to vent pent-up grievances, to show off for a moment, fearing that one's words are not shocking or sensational.

　　Not only that, now, there are demands for twenty years of fixed interest, demands for the public side to withdraw from industrial and commercial enterprises, and demands for political parties to withdraw from schools—essentially demanding that the Party withdraw from schools, with other democratic parties merely "bearing the brunt." Some people have even made the assertion of "Party rule," saying things like "If the Communist Party falls, China will not fall," and "China is the China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries," and "It would be best to 'abdicate and give way to the virtuous' and organize a coalition government." Such clamor is rampant, making people wonder, from what kind of wish are these opinions put forward, and do they still want to take the socialist road?

　　I don't understand why we can't say: "The leadership of the Communist Party is mainly successful?" Did it lead the liberation of China's 600 million people in the wrong direction? Since liberation eight years ago, the country's economic construction has been developing vigorously, and the lives of the people across the country are improving day by day. Are these things that should not have been done? Were the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements and the Three Great Transformations good or bad? Only those with ulterior motives, who dare to write "anonymous letters," are unwilling to see these achievements. Now, those who affirm the Party's achievements are "eulogists"; those who conform to the Party's intentions are "shameless activists." I dare not force these people to join the "eulogists," and I dare not force these people to become "shameless activists." I only ask these people to think calmly, put aside personal feelings, compare with the past, and speak a fair word in good conscience.

　　The Party's work has shortcomings, but the style of individual Party organizations or individual Party members cannot be confused with the Party itself. It is necessary to first affirm the Party's leadership. Without the Party's leadership, it is impossible to move towards socialism.

　　Many of the "three evils" within the Party have been exposed, and it is estimated that more in-depth exposure is needed. The causes of these three evils are very complex, and the desire for great achievements and eagerness for quick success have more or less contributed to their growth. Since liberation, things have been done vigorously, and many good things have indeed been done, but we are always too busy, with one wave not yet settled and another rising. Things should be done, but there is too little research and too little consultation. Implementation is emphasized, and speed is demanded. Conservatism is certainly wrong, but rash advances can also cause losses. Taking the setting up of certain specialties in Tsinghua University as an example, some even had no idea of the content of their training. The day before, they were completely ignorant, and when they woke up the next day, they immediately wanted it, not starting from the first grade, but starting from the senior grades at the same time, which caused great passivity in teaching and learning. Scientific research is affected by several unpredictable factors, and it is difficult to measure by piecework or time. As for teaching reform, the implementation of teaching plans, learning from the Soviet Union, and taking the socialist road were not wrong, but in 1952, we were eager for quick success and could only mechanically copy. In the process of implementation, due to incompatibility with China's reality, excessive tension was caused in teaching, and only temporary modifications were possible. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, almost every grade has its own teaching plan. Someone said: "Before the finished product leaves the factory, the blueprint is revised first." When there are some achievements in teaching, we brag about them; when there are some shortcomings, we become impatient. More preparation should be made beforehand, and we should not rush into things. A more steady pace will not necessarily affect the progress of the cause. On the contrary, mistakes are made in haste, and haste makes waste.

　　The most effective way to eliminate the three evils, I believe, is the conscientious implementation of democratic centralism. The Party committee system, which embodies the Party's leadership in universities, is not bad, but at the same time, strengthening the administrative organization below the school affairs committee, and closely combining the Party's leadership with the role of teachers, will better mobilize the positive factors in the school.

　　Finally, I would like to mention that some people believe that Party members are relatively silent in the rectification movement and do not take the lead, which increases the concerns of the masses and hinders the development of blooming and contending. I believe that the development of blooming and contending should not be affected by the silence of Party members, but Party members should not remain so silent, only listening and not speaking. The shortcomings of the three evils are facts, but this does not mean that the banner of Marxism-Leninism has faded. On the contrary, due to the unfolding of the rectification movement, it stands even more upright, and its color is more鲜明 (鲜明 = bright). Shortcomings must be faced squarely, and mistakes must be corrected, but the position must be firm. There can be no timidity in safeguarding the truth. We cannot ignore fallacies that violate socialism. I have a feeling (I hope it is a delusion) that the Party's leadership, at least the Party's leadership in Tsinghua University, is weakening. Things are unclear in the school, the pace is somewhat chaotic, and Party cadres are hesitant to take responsibility, which will bring losses to the work and is not in line with the principle of not hindering both rectification work. The letting go must continue to let go more, and the contending must continue to contend more, but at the same time, we must also argue.

### 大鸣大放中的一些意见

　　大鸣大放中的一些意见
　　清华大学副校长  陈士骅
    出国短短两周，回来后看到祖国已经变了样子，全国各地都在大鸣大放。即以清华大学这一小小角落而论，尽管“水木清华”风景依然，但是各种形式的墙报和座谈会，造成了清华园的一种新气氛，使我几乎不敢相信我自己的眼所见的就是我两周前才离开的故土。对于党的缺点，揭发得越来越彻底，批评得越来越深刻，但是党群关系并不是因此而变得疏远，恰恰相反，他们是更加团结了。这就不能不使人感到党领导的正确和英明。许多外国朋友对于我们党的鸣放政策和这次整风运动极为重视，渴望读到毛主席于最高国务会议讲话的全文。在布拉格有一位朋友甚至对我说：“不要以为毛泽东是只属于你们中国人民的。”
    有人说，现在的鸣放还很不够。我认为够与不够是相对的，要想作出估计，就必须有一个衡量的标准，而团结——批评——团结这一公式可能是最恰当的衡量标准。衡量的结果，确实觉得还有不够的一方面，那就是严肃认真不够，和风细雨不够；当然也有一部分人有顾虑，还作不到“知无不言，言无不尽”；甚至还有一部分人对党的政策不是很相信，认为放了鸣了党也未必知过能改，因而不愿鸣不愿放。但是另一方面，则感到鸣放得有些过火，甚至已经越出了社会主义的范围。例如：一提到党与非党之间有道墙，则惟恐刻描得这道墙不够厚；一提到党与非党之间有条沟，则惟恐刻描得这条沟不够深。当然把墙厚沟深形象一下有必要，但是更主要的问题是在于如何把墙拆掉和把沟填平。“成绩是主要的”，不能说；“党和非党的关系基本上是正常的”，不能说。当然个别党员或个别党组织不容否认的有主观主义，官僚主义和宗派主义，是有缺点，是有错误。但也正因为如此，党才发动这一次伟大的整风运动，并且号召党外人士的帮助，这正是我们国家的民主自由的最高表现形式，这就需要我们平心静气，动脑筋，想办法，从团结的愿望出发，本着“治病救人”的目的，向党进行同志式的批评，使党内整风作到更彻底、更成功。而不应是乘此良机，一吐胸中不平之气，逞一时之快，惟恐其语不惊人，言不耸听。
    还不仅如此。现在，有要求二十年定息的，有要求公方退出工商企业的，有要求党派退出学校的——本质上是要求党退出学校，其他民主党派不过是“陪绑的”。甚至有人竟然作出“党天下”的断语，什么“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”，什么“中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内”，“最好是‘退位让贤’，组织联合政府”诸如此类的吵嚷，纷纷然，不禁使人要问，这些意见究竟是从怎样的一个愿望出发而提出来的，是不是还想走社会主义的道路？
    我不明白，为什么不能说：“共产党的领导，成绩是主要的？”难道它领导中国六亿人口的解放事业是领导错了吗？解放八年以来，全国的经济建设，蓬蓬勃勃地展开，全国人民的生活正在日趋改善，难道这都是不应该作的？三反、五反、三大改造究竟是好是坏？只有那些别有用心，勇于写“匿名信”之流才不愿意看到这些成绩。如今肯定党的成绩的，便是“歌颂派”；符合党的企图的便是“无耻的积极分子”。我不敢强求这些人来加入“歌颂派”，更不敢强这些人变为“无耻的积极分子”，我只企求这些人平心静气的想一想，撇开个人，对比过去，凭良心说一句公道话。
    党的工作是有缺点的，但不能把个别党组织或个别党员的作风和党相混淆。必需首先肯定党的领导，没有党的领导，就不可能走向社会主义。
    党内“三害”，已经揭发了不少，估计还需更深入的揭发。这三害的产生，原因是很复杂的，而好大喜功，急于求成也或多或少有助于它们的滋长。解放以来，轰轰烈烈，好事确是作了不少，但是总是忙迫不堪，一波未平，一波又起。事情都是应当作的，只是研究少、商量少，贯的多，要的快。保守固然不对，冒进同样会造成损失。以清华大学某些专业的设置为例，甚至有的根本无人知其培养内容，前一天还茫无所知，一觉醒来，立刻就要，不是从一年级起开始培养，而是要从高年级同时开始，这就造成了教与学上的非常被动。又如科学研究是受着若干不可预计的因素的影响的，很难计件计时。再如教学改革，执行教学计划，学习苏联，走社会主义的道路并没有错，但在1952年急于求成，只有硬搬硬套。在执行过程中，由于与中国实际不合，造成教学上的过度紧张，只有临时修改。以清华大学而论，几乎各年级各有其教学计划，有人讲：“成品还未出厂，先修改蓝图”。教学中刚有些成绩，便大吹大擂；稍有些缺点，便沉不着气。事前多作酝酿，不要一哄而上，步伐稳一些，不见得就影响了事业的进展，相反地，忙中生错，欲速反不达。
    消灭三害的最有效的办法，我认为是民主集中制的认真贯彻。在高等学校中体现党领导的党委制并没有什么不好，但同时加强校务委员会以下的行政组织，使党的领导和教师的作用紧密地结合起来，是会更好地调动学校中积极因素的。
    最后，还想提一点，就是有人认为在整风运动中，党员比较沉闷，不带头，这就增加了群众的顾虑，有碍鸣放的开展。我认为鸣放的开展不应当由于党员的沉闷而受到影响，但是党员也不应当这样沉闷下去，只听不鸣。三大害的缺点是事实，但是这绝不等于马列主义的旗帜减了色。相反地，由于整风运动的展开，它树立得更加挺拔了，它的颜色更加鲜明了。缺点要正视，错误要纠正，但是立场要坚定，在这卫护真理上不能灰溜溜。像违反社会主义的谬论，就不能置之不顾。我有这样的感觉（我希望这是一个错觉），仿佛党的领导，至少是清华大学的党的领导在削弱。学校中是非不明，步调有些乱，党员干部缩手缩脚不敢负责任，这对工作是会带来损失的，是不合乎整风工作两不误的方针的。放还要继续更多的放，鸣还要继续更多的鸣，但同时还要争。
