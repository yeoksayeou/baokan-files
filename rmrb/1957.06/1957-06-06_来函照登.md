Letters to the Editor

    On May 31st, your publication reported on my speech at the National Federation of Industry and Commerce symposium on the 30th. There are two points in the report that differ from what I said. Please correct them:
    (1) "…to carry out free competition" should be changed to "…to carry out free operation."
    (2) "It's not because of too much control, but because there is no control," should be changed to "Some are controlled too tightly, and some are not controlled enough."

Fujian Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce Chairman Liu Yongye

    来函照登
    5月31日贵刊报道我于30日在全国工商界座谈会上发言，其中有两点内容与我说的有出入，请更正：
    （一）“……来进行自由竞争。”一句应改为“……来进行自由经营。”
    （二）“不是由于管得太死，而是没有管，”一句应改为“是有的管得太死，有的没有管。”
    福建省工商联主任委员  刘永业
