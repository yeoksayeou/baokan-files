　　Rejecting Saudi Mediation, Disagreeing with Government Compromise
　　Lebanese Opposition Persists in Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salam said in Beirut on the 17th that the Lebanese opposition party would reject the proposal made by Saudi Arabian King Saud to mediate the conflict between the Lebanese government and the opposition party.

    Salam told a reporter from the Indian Press Trust that Saudi Arabia had proposed some concessions the Lebanese government was prepared to make if the opposition party would compromise. The Saudi proposal included: the formation of a coalition government (which Salam believed would be weak), the establishment of an upper house with opposition party members participating, and the release of all opposition leaders and the cessation of their prosecution.

    Salam stated that he could not compromise. He said that the opposition party would not stop fighting. It seems that some people are determined to split the Arab countries, and one link in this divisive action is to split the nationalist forces of Lebanon.

    Salam and the other two leaders of the Lebanese opposition party "National Front," former Prime Ministers Yafi and Weini, were invited by Saudi Arabian King Saud to Amman, the capital of Jordan, on June 13 for talks. Saud, who was visiting Jordan at the time, attempted to persuade the Lebanese opposition leaders to compromise with the government. The "National Front" will meet on the 19th to discuss its attitude towards the Saudi proposal.

　　拒绝沙特调停　不同政府妥协
　　黎巴嫩反对党坚持斗争
    据新华社19日讯　黎巴嫩前总理赛布·萨拉姆17日在贝鲁特说，黎巴嫩反对党将拒绝沙特阿拉伯国王沙特为调停黎巴嫩政府同反对党之间的冲突所提出的建议。
    萨拉姆对印度报业托辣斯的记者说，沙特曾经提出黎巴嫩政府准备作的一些让步，如果反对党肯妥协的话。沙特提出的建议中包括：成立联合政府（萨拉姆认为这种联合政府将是软弱的），成立有反对党成员参加的上议院，释放所有反对党领袖并且停止对他们起诉。
    萨拉姆表示不能妥协。他说，反对党不会停止斗争。看来有人决心要分裂阿拉伯国家，这种分裂行动的一个环节就是分裂黎巴嫩的民族主义力量。
    萨拉姆同黎巴嫩反对党“民族阵线”的另外两个领袖前总理雅非和魏尼曾经在6月13日被沙特阿拉伯国王沙特请到约旦首都安曼去会谈。沙特当时正在约旦访问，他企图说服黎巴嫩反对党领袖同政府妥协。“民族阵线”将在19日开会讨论对沙特建议的态度。
