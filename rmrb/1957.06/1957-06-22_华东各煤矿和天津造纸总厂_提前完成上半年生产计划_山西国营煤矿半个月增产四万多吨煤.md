Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st - The coal mines under the Jinan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry in East China have already completed the first half of the year's production plan twelve days ahead of schedule on June 18th. The actual output increased by more than 23% compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that the bureau can produce 420,000 tons more raw coal for the country by the end of June. The cost savings are also relatively good for the bureau as a whole. From January to the end of May this year, the bureau saved a total of more than 1,215,500 yuan in costs.

The production safety situation in the coal mines in East China in the first half of this year was not good enough, and safety accidents often occurred. Except for the Jiawang Mining Bureau, the tunneling work of other mining bureaus and mines has not been completed as planned. The Zibo Mining Bureau's costs exceeded the budget in the first half of the year, and the quality of coal was not good enough. The Jinan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry is actively taking measures to improve these problems, with special emphasis on doing a good job in waterproofing to ensure production safety during the rainy season.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th - The state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill completed the first half of the year's production plan for paper and cardboard eleven and a half days ahead of schedule today; yesterday, the factory completed the first half of the year's production plan for commodity pulp twelve days ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of June, a total of more than 2,400 tons of glazed paper, printing paper, white cardboard and commodity pulp can be overproduced.

The factory completed the first half of the year's plan ahead of schedule while trying its best to overcome the difficulties of raw materials. At the beginning of the first quarter, raw materials were very tight. The factory promptly dispatched more than 200 employees to travel to various producing areas to purchase reeds, and the raw material difficulties were quickly overcome.

Production workers have launched a production increase and economy movement to fulfill the national plan, and have set off a vigorous socialist competition. In February, the cooking section lost nearly 400 tons of pulp due to 18 batches of substandard products. Workers and technicians immediately studied and formulated new operating methods and technological conditions. Since March, not a ton of pulp has been lost.

Tianjin is one of the bases for supplying cultural paper for the whole country, and the output of Tianjin Paper Mill accounts for more than 52% of the city's output.

This newspaper, Taiyuan, 20th - After overfulfilling the national plan in May, the staff and workers of state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province produced more than 40,000 tons of raw coal for the country in the first half of June.

The leaders of the coal mines in Shanxi Province paid attention to comprehensively arranging work and solving problems in a timely manner this month, so that safe production was achieved in the first half of June. The safety situation was better than any month since the beginning of the year. The daily output has increased compared with the first ten days of May.

　　华东各煤矿和天津造纸总厂
    提前完成上半年生产计划
    山西国营煤矿半个月增产四万多吨煤
    新华社济南21日电　煤炭工业部济南管理局所属华东地区各矿务局、矿，已经在6月18日提前十二天完成了上半年的产量计划，实产量比去年同期提高了23％以上。预计到6月底全局可以为国家多产原煤四十二万吨。成本节约情况从全局来看也比较好，从今年1月到5月底，全局共节约成本一百二十一万五千多元。
    今年上半年华东地区各煤矿的生产安全情况不够好，常发生安全事故。掘进工作除贾汪矿务局以外，其它矿务局、矿都没有完成计划。淄博矿务局上半年的成本超支，煤的质量也不够好。对于这些问题，煤炭工业部济南管理局正积极采取措施加以改进，其中特别强调作好防水工作，以保证雨季生产安全。
    据新华社天津20日电　国营天津造纸总厂，提前十一天半在今天完成了上半年的纸张和纸板的生产计划；昨天，这个厂提前十二天完成了上半年商品纸浆的生产计划。预计到6月底，共可以超额生产两千四百多吨有光纸、出版印刷纸、白版纸和商品纸浆。
    这个厂是在极力克服原料困难的情况下提前完成上半年计划的。在第一季度开始的时候，原料非常紧张。工厂及时出动了二百多名职工跋山涉水到各产地采购芦苇，很快就使原料的困难得到了克服。
    生产工人为完成国家计划开展了增产节约运动，掀起了热火朝天的社会主义竞赛。蒸煮锅工段在2月份由于出了十八锅等外品而使纸浆损失了将近四百吨，工人们和技术人员立即研究制定了新的操作方法和工艺技术条件，从3月份以来没有损失一吨纸浆。
    天津是供应全国文化用纸的基地之一，天津造纸总厂的产量占全市产量的52％还多。
    本报太原20日电　山西省国营煤矿职工继5月份超额完成国家计划以后，6月上半月又多给国家生产了四万多吨原煤。
    山西省各煤矿领导方面这个月注意了全面安排工作，及时解决问题，使6月上半月作到了安全生产。安全情况比年初以来任何一个月都好。日产量比5月上旬都有增加。
