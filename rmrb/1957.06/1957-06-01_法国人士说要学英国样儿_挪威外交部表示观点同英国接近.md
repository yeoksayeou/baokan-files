Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Paris dispatch: The British decision to unilaterally relax trade restrictions with China has been met with reactions in the French capital that it was "long expected." French sources say other countries will inevitably follow the British example, because they cannot allow Britain to "monopolize" the Chinese market.

Several Paris newspapers published commentaries on the British move in their morning editions on the 31st. The right-wing "Aurore" said that there was "no need for Britain and France to sacrifice commercial interests to please the United States."

Several newspapers believed that the United States should re-examine its "outdated" Far East policy. "Combat" stated that Britain's action was the "second defeat suffered by the United States on the Far Eastern front" after the anti-American incidents in Taipei. The newspaper believed that if the United States did not "calmly and quickly" re-examine the entire China issue, it would risk suffering "a third, or even more serious, defeat" which would "shake the entire Western camp."

Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Oslo dispatch: A Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on the 30th that in preliminary discussions on the issue of trade with China, Norway's views were, in principle, close to the British attitude. He said that when they received the final report from the Norwegian delegation attending the Paris "China Committee" meeting, the government would consider the issue.

    法国人士说要学英国样儿
    挪威外交部表示观点同英国接近
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：英国单独放宽对华贸易限制的决定在法国首都的反应是：早在人们“意料之中”。法国人士说，其他国家也必然会学英国的样儿，因为他们不能让英国“垄断”中国的市场。
    31日早上出版的巴黎报纸不少都对英国这一行动发表了评论。右翼的“震旦报”说，英法两国“没有必要牺牲商业利益来讨好美国”。
    好几家报纸都认为美国应该重新研究它“过时的”远东政策。“义勇军报”说，英国这一作法，是在台北反美事件以后，美国在“远东战线上所遭到的第二次失败”。该报认为，如果美国不“冷静而又迅速地”重新研究整个中国问题的话，它将有遭到“第三次、甚至更严重的失败的危险”，这种失败将会“动摇整个西方阵营”。
    新华社31日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威外交部发言人30日说，在对华贸易问题的初步讨论中，挪威的观点在原则上已经接近英国的态度。他说，当他们接到参加巴黎“中国委员会”会议的挪威代表团的最后报告时，政府就要考虑这个问题。
