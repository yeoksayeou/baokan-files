    Protest Against Threatening Letter!
    What Unspeakable Things Are You Doing? Why Don't You Dare Stand Upright and Openly!
    Comrades Editors:
    The Party's great rectification movement is gradually deepening. We are very interested in paying attention to the various opinions published in the newspapers every day. These opinions have opened our eyes, inspired and broadened our thinking, and have been of great benefit. Today, when I opened the second page of the People's Daily, I was very angry. In this great and historically significant rectification movement, someone actually used an anonymous letter to intimidate others, trying to achieve his unspeakable purpose.
    I think that the person who wrote this anonymous letter must still be in China today, and has not left the world. Although he is anonymous, I think he can still see the newspaper, and can still see my protest and questioning.... I hope he can see my article, and after reading it, he can bravely and openly stand in the sunlight, in front of the people, and answer my protest and questioning.
    First of all, I want to question the person who wrote the anonymous letter, who is standing on the side of the people and the truth, is it you or Comrade Lu Yuwen? If you represent the people and the truth, why don't you dare to speak openly in the world of the people today? Saying that there are some concerns is unfounded. Today, whether in forums or in articles published in newspapers and magazines, whether you agree with the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism or disagree with the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism, you can openly express your opinions and everyone can discuss them. Many major fundamental issues are being debated. Why don't you dare to openly express your opinions if you disagree with Comrade Lu Yuwen's speech? Could it be that what you are doing is unspeakable?
    You insult Comrade Lu Yuwen as "working for the tiger" and "shameless to the extreme." I think it is you who are shameless to the extreme. Comrade Lu Yuwen is standing openly and honestly in the sunlight, in front of the people, expressing his own opinions and views. He did not secretly write shameless anonymous threatening letters! Are you saying that he is "working for the tiger"? I can explain it for him. The "tiger" you are talking about is not the "evil tiger" of the Kuomintang reactionaries, nor is it the paper tiger of American imperialism, but the brave tiger of the six hundred million people. To be a "chang" (an accomplice) for this brave and great "tiger" of the six hundred million people who overthrew the three great mountains with their own hands is not "shameless to the extreme." But those who inherit the mantle of Kuomintang secret agents, write anonymous threatening letters to intimidate others are truly working for the paper tiger of American imperialism and the evil tiger of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and are truly shameless to the extreme.
    You intimidate Comrade Lu Yuwen to "turn back as soon as possible," otherwise you "will not forgive" him. I want to ask, which way do you want Comrade Lu Yuwen to "turn back," and who "will not forgive" him? I know that Comrade Lu Yuwen is not a Communist, but a good cadre of the people and an active force in building socialism and building our happy life. I don't know what "head" you want him to "turn," and which way to "turn back"? Do you want him to "turn" into a bad cadre of the people? Or do you want him to turn back to the Kuomintang reactionaries?
    The so-called "forgiveness," in fact, others do not hope for your "forgiveness." Because if you "forgive" them, the motherland and the six hundred million people who gave birth to them and raised them will not "forgive" them. It is better to ask you not to "forgive" them. I think it is you who should honestly ask them and the people to forgive you.
    I want to ask again: You said, "If the Communist Party only recognizes your gang of people," "it will one day perish." I want to ask: Lu Yuwen and the others are "this gang of people," and which gang are you? I think that now the Communist Party recognizes this gang of people who speak up when it is beneficial to the people, criticize when it is wrong, and support when it is right, is doing the right thing. And it is also doing a good job by not recognizing your gang of people who meet people with ghost faces, shoot cold arrows behind their backs, and write threatening letters to threaten others. As for the question of the Communist Party "will one day perish," I think you don't have to worry. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country are using various methods, including rectification, to build communism and world harmony as soon as possible. Finally, the Communist Party itself will also be eliminated. However, it is impossible to make the Communist Party perish now.
    I support Comrade Lu Yuwen's statement, "I am not afraid of insults, not afraid of threats, and I still want to speak." Finally, I hope that Comrade Lu Yuwen will add another sentence, "I am also not afraid of being shot in the back"!!
    I would also like to state that my mailing address is the Academic Research Committee of Beijing Art Normal College. I am a small clerk and live in the Art Teachers' Staff Dormitory, named Dong Yulong. This seems very clear. It will be very convenient for the anonymous letter writer to send me a letter or do something.
              Dong Yulong, June 7th

### 抗议恐吓信！你们在干什么不可告人的勾当？为什么不敢光明正大地站出来！

    抗议恐吓信！
    你们在干什么不可告人的勾当？为什么不敢光明正大地站出来！编辑同志：
    党伟大的整风运动，正逐步深入，我们每天都非常有兴趣的关心报纸上发表的各式各样的意见。这些意见打开了我们的眼界，启发和开阔了我们的思路，有很大的好处。今天打开人民日报第二版一看，真使人非常气愤，在这个伟大的有着历史意义的整风运动中，竟有人用匿名信来恫吓别人，企图达到他那不可告人的目的。
    我想，写这封匿名信的人，今天一定还在中国，也未离开人间，他虽然匿名，我想他还能看到报纸，还能看到我的抗议和质问……。我希望他能看到我的文章，看了后并能勇敢、光明正大地站在光天化日之下，在人民大众的面前回答我的抗议和质问。
    首先，我要向写匿名信的人质问，是谁站在人民和真理这边，是你还是卢郁文同志。若是你代表人民和真理，为什么在今天人民的天下里，你不敢站在光天化日之下公开说话。说有某种顾虑是没有根据的，今天，在座谈会上也好，在报纸杂志上发表文章也好，赞成共产党和马列主义的也好，不赞成共产党和马列主义的也好，都可以公开发表，大家讨论。有很多属于重大的根本性的问题，都在辩论，为什么你们对卢郁文同志的发言不同意却不敢光明正大的发表意见呢？莫非你们所干的勾当不可告人？
    你们辱骂卢郁文同志“为虎作伥”，“无耻之尤”，我看无耻之尤的正是你们。卢郁文同志是堂堂皇皇的站在光天化日之下、人民大众面前发表自己的意见和看法，他并没偷偷摸摸的写无耻之尤的匿名恐吓信！说他“为虎作伥”吗？我倒可以替他解释解释，你所说的“为虎”的“虎”不是国民党反动派的“恶虎”，也不是美帝国主义的纸老虎，而是英勇六亿人民之虎，能为用自己的双手推翻三座大山的六亿人民这个英勇伟大的“虎”作“伥”，也并不是“无耻之尤”。而继承国民党特务分子的衣钵，写匿名恐吓信恫吓别人的才真正是为美帝国主义这个纸老虎及国民党反动派这个恶虎作伥，才真正是无耻之尤。
    你们恫吓卢郁文同志“及早回头”，否则“便不会饶恕”他。我要质问，你们要卢郁文同志向那“回头”，谁“不会饶恕”他。我知道卢郁文同志不是共产党人，但是人民的好干部，建设社会主义、建设我们幸福生活的积极力量。我不知道你叫他“回”什么“头”，向那“回头”？是要他“回”成个人民的坏干部吗？还是叫他向国民党反动派那儿回头？
    所谓“饶恕”，其实别人并不希望你们的“饶恕”。因为你们要“饶恕”了，祖国和生他们的父母、养他们的六亿人民便不会“饶恕”他们了，还是请你别“饶恕”的好。我觉得倒是你们要老老实实的请他们和人民饶恕你们才行。
    我要再问：你们说，“共产党如果只认你们这班人的话”，“总有一天会走向灭亡”。我要问：卢郁文他们是“这班人”，而你们是那班人呢？我觉得，现在共产党认这班对人民有利就说，不同意就讲，错啦就批评，对啦就拥护的人，是认对了；而不认你们那班带着鬼脸子见人，背后放冷箭，写恫吓信来威胁恫吓别人的人，也做得不错。至于说共产党“总有一天会走向灭亡”的问题，我想，你倒不必着急。共产党和全国人民正在用各种方法、也包括整风在内，尽快的建成共产主义、世界大同，最后共产党自己也消灭。不过，要共产党现在就灭亡，那是无论如何也办不到的。
    我拥护卢郁文同志的说法，“我不怕辱骂，不怕威胁，还要讲话”。最后，我希望卢郁文同志再加上一句，“我还不怕打黑枪”！！
    我还要声明，我的通讯地址是北京艺术师范学院学术研究委员会，我是个小职员，住在艺师职工宿舍，叫董玉龙。这样似乎很清楚了，写匿名信者，给我寄信或干什么的就都很方便了。
