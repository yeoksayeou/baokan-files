Egypt - A Nation of Revolution
　　Egyptian Ambassador Hassan Ragab
　　Today, as Egypt celebrates its Independence Day, the fruits of many years of suffering and arduous work are truly beginning to be reaped. On this day, the entire nation of Egypt will remember and revere its millions of sons who willingly gave their lives as patriots so that Egypt could live with dignity.
　　The Egyptian people's struggle to break free from the long oppression of foreign rule is a prominent feature of modern Egyptian history. Egypt's last dynasty came from overseas, ruling Egypt for over 150 years. What is particularly strange is that the rule of this dynasty was intertwined with British rule over Egypt. Only after this dynasty was driven out of Egypt did British rule decline, and the British completely withdrew from Egypt.

　　Napoleon's Expedition to Egypt
　　The history of modern Egypt can be traced back to the end of the Mamluk dynasty of the Turks and Napoleon's expedition in 1798. Napoleon was not only a great strategist but also a visionary statesman. To rule the world, he understood that he must occupy the most important and critical locations in the world. Egypt, located on the most important transportation route connecting the East and the West, could not be more important. At that time, the East was the source of raw materials, while the West possessed advanced technology and the necessary machinery to turn these raw materials into finished products. The East was forced to sell these raw materials at very low prices, while the West, monopolizing the means of production, sold finished products at exorbitant prices, thereby obtaining huge profits.
　　Napoleon personally led an expeditionary force of over 30,000 men, who raided and occupied Egypt in 1798. However, the Egyptian people immediately launched a struggle against the invaders until the French army was forced to withdraw in 1801.

　　Arabi Pasha's Revolution
　　Although Egypt got rid of French rule, it soon became the prey of the Turks again. The Turks established the Muhammad Ali dynasty, the ancestor of Farouk. Under the rule of the Ali dynasty, the peasants were heavily taxed. After paying taxes under the sword of their Turkish masters, they had little left for themselves. At the same time, Turkish landlords and the ruling family did not have to pay taxes at all. In the army, which was mainly composed of Egyptian soldiers, the commanders were Turks, and Egyptians could only be promoted to the rank of captain at most.
　　The oppression of the Turks finally led to the revolution of Arabi Pasha in 1881. Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Britain had been keenly aware of the importance of Egypt to the trade route between Britain and its Eastern colonies and decided to seize the opportunity to occupy Egypt.

　　British Entry into Egypt
　　Britain took advantage of Arabi's uprising to march into Egypt and suppress the revolution. They threw Arabi and his supporters into prison and restored the royal rule. From then on, the latter remained at the beck and call of their British saviors. After 1882, the British invaders and the royal family, who were hated by the people, joined together. The British cleverly did not declare Egypt a British colony, claiming that their entry into Egypt was only temporary and that they would leave as soon as the situation returned to normal. But their stay was repeatedly extended.

　　Mustafa Kamil's Revolutionary Preparations
　　But Egypt did not slumber during these years. The Egyptian gunpowder keg, squeezed tightly by oppression, was developing pressure sufficient to cause an explosion. The explosion point was reached when Mustafa Kamil rose up to gather supporters, call on the people to fight against Britain, and cultivate the spirit of nationalism that had begun to ignite among the Egyptian people. Mustafa Kamil, after realizing the first stage of his revolution, initially awakening the masses and preparing them for struggle and sacrifice, unfortunately died young at the age of thirty-six.

　　The Revolution of 1919
　　During the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Egypt was turned into a huge military base in the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers flocked in from British colonies such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. During the war, Britain forcibly conscripted Egyptian laborers to work on the front lines and the transportation lines of the Sinai Peninsula. Although Egypt contributed greatly to helping the Allies win the war in the Middle East, Britain still disregarded her legitimate rights to autonomy and refused to withdraw its troops from Egypt. As a result, the famous 1919 uprising broke out. In this uprising, many Egyptians shed blood and sacrificed their lives, and the colonialists carried out many massacres to suppress the uprising.

　　Egypt Between the Two World Wars
　　During the two world wars, the characteristic of Britain's policy in Egypt was to quite skillfully grasp the safety valve of the high pressure in the Egyptian nationalist boiler. Whenever the explosion point was reached, Britain would open the safety valve, make some concessions to Egypt, so as to reduce the pressure in the boiler and avoid an explosion.
　　In 1922, Britain issued the famous February 28 Declaration, declaring Egypt a sovereign kingdom, thereby ending its status as a British protectorate under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles.
　　In 1936, under the threat of growing Egyptian nationalism within Egypt and due to the tension of the world situation, Britain was forced to make further compromises to Egypt and signed the 1936 treaty, which stipulated that all British troops stationed in Egypt should be transferred to the Suez Canal Zone and the Sinai Peninsula, that the Egyptian army should gradually develop, and that it should bear the responsibility of defending the mainland.
　　Although the outbreak of World War II hindered the realization of the first part of the treaty, it greatly helped the growth of the Egyptian army.

　　Egypt After World War II
　　After the war, the Egyptian people rose up again to fight, this time not only demanding that British troops withdraw to the canal zone, but also demanding that British troops withdraw completely from Egypt and abolish the 1936 treaty concluded with Britain.

　　The Creation of the State of Israel
　　Subsequently, imperialism committed one of the most serious mistakes in history. Under the influence of Jewish capitalism, it allowed the establishment of the State of Israel within the Arab country of Palestine, as everyone knows. As a result of the establishment of this country, more than one million Arab refugees were expelled. They have been homeless since 1948 and remain so to this day. The establishment of the State of Israel was a turning point in Arab history.

　　Arab Nationalism
　　The Arabs number over 80 million, and they occupy the following countries: Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.
　　They belong to the same bloodline, speak the same language, and 90% believe in Islam.
　　In the past, they formed a single, prosperous and powerful country and became the pioneers of civilization. In the dark ages that swept across Europe in the Middle Ages, it was the Arabs who preserved Greek and Latin literature and science, preventing them from being destroyed. It was the Arabs who brought the culture and art of China and Asia during their long-distance trade travels. Many sciences and arts have also been developed thanks to the efforts of the Arabs.
　　Western countries used all these to develop their arts and industries, and then developed weapons of war, which they used to conquer Arab, Asian countries, and China in the last century. In this way, the great Arab countries were divided into these many parts under new names, while in the past they were actually a single, indivisible country.
　　Not only that, due to the conspiracies of colonial countries, these so-called Arab countries are often entangled in conspiracies and feudalism.

　　Arab Unity Against Israel
　　The establishment of the State of Israel in the heart of the Arab countries was a heavy blow to the Arab countries. It awakened the Arab nation and put aside the old discords between them. The Arab countries declared war on Israel. The imperialist powers equipped Israel with modern weapons, while the Arab armies did not have enough weapons and were not adequately trained.

　　The Impact of the Creation of Israel on Modern Egyptian History
　　Egypt experienced the Israeli war unprepared. Among the Egyptian officers who participated in the war was a young officer. This officer, who fought bravely, was outstanding, and was wounded several times, often sat and pondered the problems of this war, thinking about what caused Egypt and its army to suffer the disaster of shame and defeat.
　　He found the following root causes:
　　1. Corrupt governments and officials who only seek personal gain and disregard the interests of the people. The former king and members of the court are primarily responsible for this situation.
　　2. The British, who support certain classes in the government and rule the entire country through them.
　　Nasser took on the responsibility of eradicating these two root causes and began to study the ways and methods of liberating Egypt. He was joined in this study by his colleagues who later became members of the Revolutionary Committee.
　　On July 23, 1952, the army's revolution began, resulting in the overthrow of the king. His cronies were purged from the entire government. A new dawn appeared in Egypt, and the British had to sign a treaty in 1954 stipulating the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt.
　　Nasser achieved a great miracle in Egypt: after many centuries of foreign rule, Egypt declared itself an independent and sovereign state, ruled by her own sons, and no longer by foreigners imposed upon her. Many reactionaries thought that the Nasser government only had support in the armed forces, but the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression proved that the greatest support for Nasser came from the people. In the first few days after the outbreak of the war of aggression, the Egyptian army had to withdraw from Port Said for some tactical reasons. But the people continued to fight and fought against the invaders. Nasser's position among the people was even further strengthened. Finally, thanks to the unity of the entire people and the spiritual support of the Arab countries and the countries of Asia and Africa, Egypt won the war.
　　The great Chinese people were one of the first countries to support Egypt both spiritually and materially. We Egyptians are very grateful to our Chinese brothers. We feel that this solidarity between all countries that have suffered from colonialism in the past will lead to the final and complete defeat of colonialism and the victory of the masses of the people.
　　Now, under the wise leadership of Nasser, Egypt is moving forward along the path of social justice, a path that will ultimately improve the living standards and bring happiness to the people who have suffered for a long time.

　　埃及——革命的国家
　　埃及大使  哈桑·拉加卜
    今天，当埃及庆祝她的独立日的时候，许许多多年的苦痛和艰巨工作的结果真正在开始得到收获。这一天，埃及全国将怀念和敬仰她的千百万的儿子，他们为了使埃及得以尊严地生存，心甘情愿地作为志士而贡献出了自己的生命。
    埃及人民为摆脱外国统治的长期压迫而进行的斗争，是现代埃及历史的突出标志。埃及最后一个王朝来自海外，它统治埃及达一百五十余年之久。尤其奇怪的是，这个王朝的统治是同英国对埃及的统治结合在一起的。只是在这个王朝被赶出埃及以后，英国的统治才衰落下去，英国人才全部从埃及撤退。
    拿破仑远征埃及
    现代埃及的历史可以上溯到土耳其人的马末娄克王朝末期和1798年拿破仑的远征。拿破仑不仅是一个伟大的战略家，而且是一个有远见的政治家。为了统治全世界，他懂得必须占有世界上最重要的关键性的地点。埃及地处沟通东方和西方的最重要的交通线上，还有什么别的地方比它更重要呢。当时东方是原料来源地，而西方则拥有把这些原料变为成品的先进技术和必要的机器。东方被迫以非常低廉的价格出售这种原料，而垄断了生产工具的西方则以过高的价格出售成品，从而获得了巨额利润。
    拿破仑亲自率领了一支三万多人的远征军，于1798年突袭并占领了埃及。但是埃及人民立即展开了反对侵略者的斗争，一直到法军被迫于1801年撤退。
    阿拉比将军的革命
    埃及虽然摆脱了法国统治，但是不久又变成了土耳其人的俎上之肉。土耳其人建立了穆罕默德·阿里王朝，他是法鲁克的祖先。在阿里王朝统治下，农民赋税苛重。他们在土耳其主人的剑口下缴纳赋税以后，自己剩下的就没有什么了。而同时，土耳其地主和统治家族却事实上不必纳税。在主要是埃及士兵组成的军队里，指挥官由土耳其人充任，埃及人至多只能升到上尉级。
    土耳其人的压迫最后引起了1881年阿拉比·帕夏的革命。英国从1869年苏伊士运河开通以后就敏锐地注意到了埃及对英国和东方殖民地之间的贸易要道的重要性，决定趁此机会占领埃及。
    英国进入埃及
    英国利用阿拉比的起义，进军埃及，镇压革命。他们把阿拉比和他的支持者投入监狱，恢复了王族统治。从此，后者对他们的英国救命菩萨一直唯命是从。1882年以后，人民所憎恨的英国侵略者和王族就结合到了一起。英国人聪明地不宣布埃及是英国殖民地，扬言说他们进入埃及只是暂时的，一俟情况恢复正常就会离开。但他们的驻留时间却一再延长。
    穆斯塔法·凯米尔的革命准备
    但是在这些年月里埃及并没有昏睡。由于压迫而挤得紧紧的这个埃及火药桶正在发展着足以引起爆炸的压力。当穆斯塔法·凯米尔起来召集支持者、号召人民进行反英斗争、培养开始在埃及人民中间燃起的民族主义精神的时候，爆炸点就到达了。穆斯塔法·凯米尔在实现了他的革命的第一阶段、初步唤醒群众和使他们准备作斗争和牺牲之后，不幸在三十六岁时夭折了。
    1919年的革命
    在1914—1918年第一次世界大战期间，埃及被变成了中东的一个巨大的军事基地。成千成万的士兵从英国殖民地、澳大利亚、新西兰和南非等地蜂拥而至。在大战中，英国强征埃及劳工到前线和西奈半岛的运输线上去工作。虽然埃及在帮助盟国在中东赢得战争胜利上出了很大的力，但是结果英国却依旧漠视她的合法的自治权利，并拒绝从埃及撤军。于是爆发了著名的1919年起义。在这次起义中，有许多埃及人流血牺牲，殖民主义者为了镇压这次起义实行多次屠杀。
    两次大战间的埃及
    在两次世界大战期间，英国在埃及的政策的特点，就是相当巧妙地掌握了控制埃及民族主义锅炉的高压力的安全瓣。每当达到爆炸点的时候，英国就开放安全瓣，向埃及作某些让步，以减低锅炉中的压力，避免爆炸。
    1922年，英国发表了有名的2月28日宣言，宣布埃及为主权王国，从而结束了1919年凡尔赛条约规定的作为英国保护国的地位。
    1936年，在埃及国内日益增长的埃及民族主义的威胁下以及由于世界局势的紧张，英国被迫向埃及作进一步的妥协，签订了1936年条约，规定英国在埃及的全部驻军转移到苏伊士运河区和西奈半岛，规定埃及军队得逐步发展，并承担保卫大陆的责任。
    第二次世界大战的爆发虽然阻碍了条约第一部分的实现，但却大大有助于埃及军队的成长。
    第二次世界大战后的埃及
    战后，埃及人民再次起来斗争，这次不光是要求英国军队撤到运河区，而且要求英军全部撤出埃及并废除和英国缔结的1936年条约。
    以色列国的产生
    随后，帝国主义犯下了历史上最严重的错误之一，它在犹太资本主义的影响下，允许在大家所知道的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯国家内建立了以色列国家。由于这个国家的建立，一百余万阿拉伯难民被驱逐出境。他们自1948年以来，迄今仍然无家可归。以色列国的建立是阿拉伯历史上的转折点。
    阿拉伯民族主义
    阿拉伯人为数达八千余万，他们占有的国家有：叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、也门、伊拉克、约旦、巴勒斯坦、科威特、埃及、苏丹、利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥。
    他们属于同一血统，操同一种语言，90％信仰伊斯兰教。
    过去，他们组成过单一的繁荣富强的国家，成为文明的前驱。在中世纪横扫欧洲的黑暗年代里，正是阿拉伯人保存了希腊和拉丁的文学和科学，使它们不致毁灭。正是阿拉伯人在他们的长途贸易旅行中带来了中国和亚洲的文化和艺术。许多科学和艺术也由于阿拉伯人的努力而得到了发展。
    西方国家利用所有这些来发展它们的艺术和工业，随后发展了战争机器，并在上一世纪用以征服了阿拉伯、亚洲各国和中国。就这样，伟大的阿拉伯国家在新的名称下被分裂为这许多部分，而过去它们实际上是单一的不可分的国家。
    不仅如此，由于殖民主义国家的阴谋，这些所谓阿拉伯国家经常纠缠在阴谋事件和封建主义之中。
    阿拉伯团结反对以色列
    在阿拉伯国家的心脏中建立以色列国，是对阿拉伯国家的沉重打击，它震醒了阿拉伯民族，抛开了他们之间旧日的不和。阿拉伯国家宣布了对以色列的战争。帝国主义列强用现代化武器装备了以色列，而阿拉伯军队却没有足够的武器，也没有经过充分的训练。
    以色列的产生对埃及现代历史的影响
    埃及毫无准备地经历了以色列战争。在参战的埃及军官中有一位青年军官。这位作战英勇、杰出并且受伤数次的军官常常坐着思索这场战争的问题，思索是什么使埃及和它的军队遭到耻辱和失败的灾祸。
    他找到了以下的祸根：
    1．腐败的政府和官员，他们只牟私利，无视人民的利益。前国王和宫廷人员首先要为这种情况负责。
    2．英国人，他们支持政府中的某些阶级，并通过他们统治整个国家。
    纳赛尔肩负起了拔除这两个祸根的责任，开始研究解放埃及的道路和方法。和他一起进行研究的，有以后成为革命委员会成员的他的同事们。
    1952年7月23日，陆军的革命开始了，结果废黜了国王。从整个政府里清除了他的党羽。埃及出现了新的曙光，英国人不得不在1954年签署了一项规定英军全部撤出埃及的条约。
    纳赛尔在埃及实现了伟大的奇迹：经过了漫长的许多世纪的外国统治以后，埃及宣布为一个独立的主权国家，统治她的是她自己的儿子，而不再是强加在她身上的外国人。不少反动分子以为纳赛尔政府只在武装部队中得到支持，但英、法、以色列的侵略证明：对纳赛尔的最大的支持来自人民。侵略战争爆发后的最初几天，埃及军队由于某种战术原因，不得不撤出塞得港。但人民继续进行斗争，和侵略者作战。纳赛尔在人民中间的地位甚至更加加强了。最后，由于全体人民的团结和阿拉伯各国及亚非各国的精神上的支持，埃及取得了战争的胜利。
    伟大的中国人民是在精神和物质上首先支持埃及的国家之一。我们埃及人十分感激我们的中国兄弟。我们感到一切在过去受过殖民主义压迫的国家之间的这种团结，将会使殖民主义最后彻底失败，使人民群众获得胜利。
    现在，埃及在纳赛尔的英明领导下，正循着社会正义的道路迈进，这条道路最后将使过去长期受苦的人民提高生活水平并且获得幸福。
