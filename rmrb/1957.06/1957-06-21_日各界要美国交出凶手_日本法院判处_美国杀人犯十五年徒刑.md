　　Japanese Circles Demand the U.S. Hand Over the Murderer
    Japanese Court Sentences U.S. Killer to Fifteen Years in Prison
    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The Japan Gunma Prefecture Council of Trade Unions made a decision on June 19th demanding that the U.S. immediately hand over the U.S. soldier Jellard, who killed a Japanese farmer, to the Japanese court for trial. The council also decided to launch a signature campaign to realize this demand.
    Japanese newspapers continue to criticize the U.S. Federal Judge's decision to refuse to hand over Jellard to the Japanese court for trial. "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial today saying that unless both the U.S. and Japanese governments abide by the terms of the U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement, there will be no "basis for mutual trust" between the two countries. The editorial believes that the U.S. Federal Judge's decision has created a "difficult situation," and the U.S. should reconsider its decision.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The Otsu District Court in Japan sentenced a U.S. soldier to fifteen years in prison on June 19th for murder and robbery.
    This U.S. soldier, named Rondell Boyles, robbed a Japanese monk of his money on December 12th last year and drowned him in Lake Biwa.

　　日各界要美国交出凶手
    日本法院判处—美国杀人犯十五年徒刑
    据新华社20日讯　日本群马县地方工会评议会6月19日作出决定，要求美国方面立刻把杀害日本农妇的美国兵哲腊德交给日本法庭审判。评议会并且决定要为实现这项要求展开签名运动。
    日本报纸继续抨击美国联邦法官拒绝把哲腊德交给日本法庭审判的决定。“朝日新闻”今天发表社论说，除非美国和日本政府双方都遵守日美行政协定的条款，否则两国之间就不会有“相互信任的基础”。这篇社论认为，美国联邦法官的决定已经造成一种“困难的局势”，美国方面应该重新考虑它的决定。
    新华社20日讯　日本大津地方裁判所6月19日判处一个杀人越货的美国兵十五年徒刑。
    这个名叫朗戴尔·波伊尔斯的美国兵在去年12月12日抢劫了一个日本和尚的钱，并且把他淹死在琵琶湖里。
