Capitalists Pursue Profits Ruthlessly, Disregarding Human Life
Nearly 600,000 Japanese Workers Injured or Killed Last Year

　　This newspaper reports that workplace accidents in Japanese industrial and mining enterprises are increasing yearly, with the number of workers injured or killed nearing 600,000 last year.

　　According to an official Japanese survey, the number of casualties in industrial and mining enterprises in 1956 was 591,200, including 5,283 deaths, 358,000 serious injuries, and 228,000 minor injuries. Last year alone, there were 214 major accidents such as explosions, roof collapses, and avalanches, resulting in 1,459 casualties. Compared to similar accidents in 1955, there was an increase of 64 incidents and 362 casualties.

　　Worker injuries and deaths in Japanese industrial and mining enterprises show a trend of increasing year by year. The number of deaths in 1950 was 3,300, and in 1954 it was 4,600. Although it decreased to 4,150 in 1955, it significantly increased in 1956. The most serious industrial sectors for injuries and deaths are manufacturing, construction, and transportation, accounting for about 70% of all accidents. The main reasons are the capitalists' ruthless pursuit of profits, the lack of safety equipment in enterprises, the implementation of "speed-up systems," and excessive worker fatigue.

　　资本家唯利是图轻视人命
　　日本工人去年死伤近六十万
    本报讯　日本工矿企业中伤亡事故逐年增加，去年死伤人数将近六十万。
    据日本官方调查，1956年工矿企业伤亡人数为五十九万一千二百人，其中死亡五千二百八十三人，重伤三十五万八千人，轻伤二十二万八千人。去年仅爆炸、冒顶、雪崩等严重事故就发生了二百一十四起，伤亡人数达一千四百五十九人。和1955年同类事故比较增加了六十四起，伤亡人数增加了三百六十二人。
    日本工矿企业的工人伤亡事故，有逐年增加的趋势。1950年死亡人数为三千三百人，1954年为四千六百人。1955年虽减少为四千一百五十人，但1956年却有极大的增加。伤亡事故最严重的是制造、建筑和运输等工业部门，约占全部事故的70％。主要原因是资本家唯利是图，企业中缺乏安全设备，实行“赶快制”，工人过度疲劳。
