　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, June 20th: Lebanese opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Hamid Frangieh accused the Solh government on June 19th of employing terror tactics against the people, resorting to police intimidation and large-scale arrests, to ensure the government's victory in the current parliamentary elections.
    Frangieh said at a press conference that the National Front, composed of opposition parties, had decided not to boycott the remaining two rounds of voting, despite the expectation that its candidates would be defeated. He said that continuing to participate in the election was to further expose "the various improper means employed by the government."
    Referring to the vote on June 9th, Frangieh said, "When the ballots were counted, witnesses were asked to leave the polling stations, and the press was initially allowed in but later driven out. This is the first time such a thing has happened in elections in this country."

　　黎反对派指责政府操纵选举
    新华社20日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩反对派领袖、前外交部长哈密德·弗朗吉6月19日指责索勒哈政府对人民施行恐怖手段，采取警察威胁和大规模逮捕的办法，来保证政府在这次议会选举中取得胜利。
    弗朗吉在记者招待会上说，由反对党派组成的民族阵线已经决定不抵制剩下的两次投票，尽管估计它的候选人将遭到失败。他说，继续参加竞选是为了进一步揭露“政府所采用的各种不正当的手段”。
    弗朗吉在谈到6月9日的投票时说，“当计算选票时，见证人被要求离开投票站，而且报界最初被允许进去后来又被赶出来，在这个国家的选举中，这种事情还是第一次发生。”
