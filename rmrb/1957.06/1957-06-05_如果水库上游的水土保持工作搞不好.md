    If Soil and Water Conservation Work is Not Done Well Upstream of the Reservoir...
    If the soil and water conservation work upstream of the reservoir is not done well, the reservoir will be silted up quickly. Since 1953, the Guanting Reservoir has accumulated an average of 44 million cubic meters of sediment per year. If this continues, its flood control capacity will be reduced in 20 years, its power generation capacity will be weakened, it will be basically ineffective in 30 years, and it will be completely filled with sediment in 48 years. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the Foziling Reservoir will also be silted up in 50 years. After the Sanmenxia Reservoir is built, if afforestation is not carried out in the upstream mountainous areas to conserve soil and water, it will also be silted up and ineffective in 30 to 35 years.

    如果水库上游的水土保持工作搞不好……
    要是水库上游的水土保持工作搞不好，那么水库是很快就会淤平的。官厅水库自1953年以来，平均每年淤积泥沙四千四百万立方公尺，长此下去，二十年后蓄洪能力就要减低，发电能力也将减弱，三十年后基本失效，四十八年后将全部淤满泥沙。佛子岭水库按现在情况预计，五十年后也将淤平。三门峡水库建成以后，如果上游山区不造林保持水土，三十到三十五年以后也将淤平失效。
