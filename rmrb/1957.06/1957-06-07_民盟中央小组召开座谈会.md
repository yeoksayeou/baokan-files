China Democratic League Central Group Holds Symposium

(Our newspaper reports) The Central Group of the China Democratic League held a symposium on June 6 to discuss how to assist the Party in its rectification campaign. They also offered criticisms of the Party's leadership.

In his speech, Qiu Kehui pointed out that the issue of democratic parties having "positions without power" stemmed from three causes: first, the lack of separation between Party and government; second, insufficient trust from the Party towards non-Party members; and third, the improper placement of some democratic figures, preventing them from fully utilizing their strengths. Only by improving these three areas could the problem of "positions without power" be resolved. He believed that Party members' privileged thinking was caused by the country's unreasonable hierarchical system. The disparity in material treatment between ministers, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and general cadres was too great, and the boundaries were too distinct. Hospitals in Beijing provided special care for the families of senior cadres, while ordinary cadres had difficulty accessing medical care. Furthermore, even furniture and meals were strictly differentiated. This hierarchical system had a very negative impact on the masses.

In her speech, Liu Qingyang argued that bureaucracy was caused by sectarianism. Sectarianism manifested as a lack of separation between Party and government, and the Party becoming detached from the masses. The lack of separation between Party and government inevitably led to non-Party members holding positions without power. Currently, the most powerful department in institutions was the personnel department, but the cadres in the personnel department lacked knowledge and were unfamiliar with the situations of various cadres, leading to many problems in their work. She sharply criticized the country's hierarchical system. She said that there was currently a trend of praising a few individuals, and some people with insufficient virtue and talent were promoted for the sake of united front work. Those who flatter, fawn, and praise enjoyed privileges, which suppressed those who had worked hard for many years. She also pointed out that when the Party recruited new members, it often regarded those who were obsequious, did not offer opinions, or flattered as activists. These people easily joined the Party, while those who truly worked diligently and persisted in revolutionary work could not. This failed to truly strengthen the Party. She criticized many people for being unwilling to learn or study after joining the Party, and for looking down on the masses, which was dangerous. She demanded that Party members strengthen their learning and not forget the masses.

Zhang Zhihe demanded that the Party handle the opinions of non-Party members after listening to them. In the past, opinions offered by non-Party members seemed to sink without a trace, which was a sign of indifference and disregard for non-Party members. When discussing the issue of non-Party members holding positions without power, he believed that this was a waste for socialism and a sign of disrespect for people. Regarding the issue of personnel management, he believed that the Party's view of virtue, talent, and seniority was currently very flexible. Following the wind and being obsequious seemed to be virtue, while those who could truly unite the masses and persist in principled struggle were instead considered backward elements.

Pu Xixiu, Chen Xingui, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Shiming, Xian Ying, Huang Yaomian, and others also spoke at the meeting.

    民盟中央小组召开座谈会
    本报讯　中国民主同盟中央小组在6月6日召开了座谈会，讨论怎样帮助党整风的问题，同时对党的领导工作提出了批评意见。
    丘克辉发言中指出，民主党派“有职无权”的问题，他认为是由三个原因造成的：一是党政不分；二是党对党外人士不够信任；三是有些民主人士的职位摆得不妥当，使他们不能发挥长处。只有改进这三方面的情况才能解决“有职无权”的问题。他认为党员的特权思想是由国家的不合理的等级制度造成的。部长、司局长、科长、一般干部物质待遇太悬殊，界限太明显。北京的医院对高级干部家属特别照顾，一般干部看病困难；此外，连家具、吃饭也分得很严格，这一套等级制度给群众影响很坏。
    刘清扬的发言中认为官僚主义是由宗派主义造成的。宗派主义的表现就是党政不分，党脱离群众。党政不分必然使党外人士有职无权。目前机关中最有权的是人事科，但人事科的干部缺乏知识，对各种干部的情况不了解，因此工作中问题很多。她尖锐地批评了国家的等级制度。她说，现在有一种捧少数人的风气，某些人德才都不够，为了统战就提拔他。吹、拍、捧的人享受特权，这样就使多少年艰苦奋斗的人受到压抑。她又指出，党在吸收新党员时往往把唯唯诺诺，不提意见或者拍马的人当作积极分子，这些人容易入党，而真正埋头苦干坚持革命工作的人反而不能入党。这样便不能真正为党增加力量。她批评许多人入党后就不肯学习，不肯钻研，轻视群众，这是危险的。她要求党员一定加强学习，同时不要忘记群众。
    张志和要求党在听取党外人士意见后一定要加以处理。过去党外人士提意见后如石沉大海，这是冷淡和轻视党外人士的表现。他在谈到党外人士有职无权时，认为这对社会主义是一种浪费，同时也是轻视人的表现。在用人问题上，他认为目前党对德、才、资的看法伸缩性很大。看风行船、唯唯诺诺仿佛就是德，真正能团结群众，坚持原则斗争的人反而成为落后分子。
    在会上发言的还有浦熙修、陈新桂、张云川、汪世铭、鲜英、黄药眠等人。
