How to Build a Socialist City
　　——Looking at Future Urban Construction from Xi'an
　　By our reporter Guo Longchun
　　
Xi'an is an ancient yet young city. Here, you can see the ruins of the Han and Tang dynasties, as well as many modern factories. When people visit the Neolithic village ruins in the eastern suburbs, they can see large new mechanical factories and textile factory buildings in the distance. Like the countless historical relics buried here, it has also accumulated many valuable construction experiences.

Recently, several relevant departments of the Central Committee came to Xi'an to summarize the experience of capital construction. I took this opportunity to conduct a short interview here.

Suffered from Blindly Seeking Large Scale and Novelty

Xi'an is a new industrial city that started construction relatively early. Before 1953, Xi'an had no urban plan. Although the scale of industrial construction and urban construction was not large, it was quite chaotic. In 1954, with the help of Soviet experts and relevant departments of the Central Committee, the overall urban plan was completed. This plan arranged the urban layout and the direction of main roads basically reasonably, thus avoiding a lot of waste in construction. In recent years, the city has built a large number of new housing, public buildings and public utilities, which basically guaranteed the smooth progress of industrial construction and solved some urgent problems in the lives of workers.

However, according to the spirit of the Central Committee's "building the country with diligence and thrift," some money was indeed wasted in urban construction in the Xi'an area in recent years.

First of all, the scale of Xi'an is indeed too large. This is mainly reflected in three aspects: First, too many factories and schools were built in a short period of time. When the overall urban plan was compiled in 1953, it was originally said that there would only be twenty-six industrial enterprises and five universities. However, in the second half of 1955 and 1956, a large number of factories and schools flocked in. Now, there are a total of forty-two new industrial enterprises of various sizes, fourteen universities, twenty-four secondary technical schools, and thirty-one cadre schools and training courses. At the same time, because some factories did not pay enough attention to compact development when selecting factory sites, and some regulations on air defense, fire prevention, and hygiene were not realistic, many factories and schools were arranged too scattered. Second, the urban population increased too much and too fast. In 1949, the urban population of Xi'an was 460,000, and by the end of 1956, it had grown to 950,000 (excluding three worker towns and floating population), more than doubling in seven years. Most of the population increased with the development of construction, but some of the population increased unreasonably due to the lack of appropriate control by the relevant units. Third, the original urban planning quotas were too large. For example, the planned living area per person was nine square meters, and the living area per person was seventy-six square meters, which did not conform to China's actual conditions. The combination of these three factors enlarged the scale of the entire city. The area of the old city gate of Xi'an is only 13.2 square kilometers, but now the "framework" of the city has stretched to 70 square kilometers (excluding three worker towns); the actual urban land use has also reached 41.2 square kilometers; according to the original long-term plan, the urban land area will even develop to 131 square kilometers!

With large scale comes high standards. These two things are passed down in the same vein in thought. At the same time, the large city scale objectively promotes some construction standards to be higher. Of the new residential buildings built in Xi'an after liberation, 67% are three-story buildings or higher, and all the buildings have water and electricity equipment, and the cost per square meter is more than 50 yuan, which is about twice as high as the cost of the original residential buildings in the old city. Many of the newly built cinemas and shops are too expensive. Some public utilities projects are also too high. Some roads are built too wide and too early, and some drainage projects are not simple enough. The construction of a sewage treatment plant with a capital construction investment of 1.25 million yuan seems to be able to be delayed now. In recent years, the city has also demolished 330,000 square meters of houses, 150,000 square meters in 1956 alone, some of which were demolished too early and too much.

The result of all aspects seeking large scale and novelty and pursuing large scale and high standards is that the state has wasted a lot of construction funds. From 1949 to now, the total investment in urban construction in Xi'an is about 300 million yuan. According to estimates, if these funds had been used in accordance with the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift from the beginning, it would have been possible to save more than 20%.

What is even more noteworthy is that due to the large scale and high standards, it was not possible to do more things with the same funds, and some problems in the lives of workers were not well resolved. For example, in 1951, Xi'an only had 17 buses. In 1956, the number increased to 98, but because the population increased rapidly and the city spread out, public transportation was still very crowded. From liberation to the end of 1956, the area of newly built housing in Xi'an was more than twice the area of the original housing, but the average living area per person dropped from 2.9 square meters at the time of liberation to 2.6 square meters. If the construction standards had been lowered earlier, more houses could have been built. It can be seen that large scale and high standards not only cost more money, but also created artificial contradictions!

Utopian "Socialist Standards"

Why do we blindly seek large scale and novelty?

Regarding this question, the reporter consulted Comrade Li Tingbi, Director of the Urban Construction Bureau of Shaanxi Province and Director of the Urban Construction Bureau of Xi'an. He said: "In addition to lack of experience and some departmentalism, the main reason is that we have a utopian and unrealistic 'socialist standard' at work in our minds." Comrade Li Tingbi also gave a vivid and specific analysis of this point.

He said: We all have a passion for building socialist cities, but we do not have a complete and specific concept of what a socialist city should look like. Instead, we vaguely believe that a socialist city is always much better than the past. When we think about it, it is large, good, high standards, and modern, as if only this is a socialist city. When a large number of factories and schools came to Xi'an after 1954, we did not propose opinions such as controlling the scale. We not only hope that the scale of construction is large and the number is large, but also hope that the standards of construction are high. Some workers' dormitories in the east and west suburbs are equipped with water and electricity, but only lack heating equipment, and we think it is not good enough!

Comrade Li Tingbi jokingly said: "This kind of approach is great and good, but unfortunately it does not conform to China's national conditions and is not commensurate with our current situation!" Then, he said: "This is called being divorced from reality and the masses. The shortcomings, mistakes, and problems in urban construction in the past all stem from here."

According to this argument, he further elaborated: The so-called "reality" includes the country's economic conditions, the people's living standards, and the local topography and landforms. Our country's characteristics are that it has a large population and little land, its economy is backward, and the people's living standards are not high. This is the starting point for all construction. Taking housing as an example, in order to use the country's limited funds in the most necessary places and to solve the problems of the majority of people, we can now build more low-rise buildings that are cheap, clean and practical. Compared with capitalist countries, although we do not have so many skyscrapers that serve a few people, our working people all have houses to live in, and they do not live in dirty slums. This is better than capitalism, and this is the superiority of socialism. The task of our socialist cities is to serve production and the working people. Therefore, in my opinion, starting from China's current economic conditions, making the best use of what we have, building diligently and thriftily, is also a socialist standard.

Several Important Opinions

Based on the situation in Xi'an, what experiences and lessons should we learn from in future urban construction? According to some comrades who studied this issue, the following points should be noted in the future:

(1) The scale of cities should not be too large. It is best to rely on existing small and medium-sized towns to build some industrial cities with a population of 100,000 to 200,000. This can save a lot of urban construction costs. The key to this issue is that the state should not arrange industrial projects too centrally.

(2) Regardless of the size of the city, it is best to develop it gradually, and it is not appropriate to build too many projects at once. Building in stages and sections gradually, many things can be delayed, which is conducive to the turnover of funds.

(3) Civil buildings and public utilities projects should be as simple as possible. Housing and public service facilities can use local materials to build more low-standard, simple buildings. Roads, water supply, and drainage projects can be lowered in standards, and should be built as little as possible and delayed. This can save funds and better meet the urgent needs of the masses.

(4) Strengthen construction management. The relevant departments of the Central Committee should formulate measures for civil building standards that are difficult for provinces and cities to control, and instruct provinces and cities to manage and supervise them.

(5) Urban planning should pay close attention to combining with local conditions. The quota for living area per person can be planned separately according to the population size, industrial layout, topography and landforms of each place, such as three square meters, four and a half square meters, and six square meters. The relevant departments of the Central Committee are also hoped to revise other urban planning quotas and air defense, fire prevention, and hygiene standards that are not in line with reality.

I think the above opinions can be used as a reference for urban construction departments to improve their work.

　　怎样建设社会主义城市
　　——从西安看今后的城市建设工作
　　本报记者  郭龙春
    西安，是一座古老而又年青的城市。在这里，既可以看到汉城、唐城的遗址，又可以看到许多现代化的工厂。人们在东郊参观新石器时代村落遗迹的时候，一抬头就有大片新型机械工厂和纺织工厂的厂房映入眼帘。像埋藏着无数的古迹文物一样，这里也积累了许多宝贵的建设经验。
    最近，中央几个有关部门到西安来总结了基本建设经验。我乘着这个机会在这里作了短时间的采访。
    吃了盲目求大求新的亏
    西安是建设开始比较早的新工业城市。1953年以前，西安市没有城市规划，工业建设和城市建设虽然数量不大，但是相当混乱。1954年，在苏联专家和中央有关部门的帮助下，完成了城市总体规划。这个规划对城市布局、主要干道走向等安排得基本上是合理的，因而使建设中避免了许多浪费。这几年，全市新建了大批住宅、公共建筑和公用事业工程，基本上保证了工业建设的顺利进行，并且解决了职工生活方面的一些迫切问题。
    但是，根据中央“勤俭建国”的精神来检查，西安地区这几年的城市建设中，也的确花了一些冤枉钱。
    首先，西安市城市的规模确实太大了。这主要表现在三个方面：一是工厂、学校在短时间内摆得过多。1953年编制城市总体规划的时候，原说只有二十六个工业企业，五个大专学校。但是在1955年下半年和1956年内，大批工厂、学校纷纷涌来。现在，新建工业企业大小共有四十二个，大专学校有十四所，中等技术学校有二十四所，干部学校和训练班有三十一所。同时，由于部分工厂在选择厂址的时候对紧凑发展注意不够，防空、防火、卫生等部分规定不切合实际，不少工厂、学校都布置得过于分散。二是城市人口增加过多过快。1949年，西安的城市人口是四十六万，到1956年底便发展到九十五万（不包括三个工人镇和流动人口），七年增加了一倍多。其中大部分人口是随着建设事业的发展而增加的，但是也有一部分人口由于各个有关单位缺乏适当控制，增加的不够合理。三是原来的城市规划定额偏大。例如，每人居住面积按九平方公尺规划，每个人的生活居住用地共要七十六平方公尺等，这都不符合我国的实际情况。这三个因素结合起来，就把整个市的规模搞大了。西安旧城关的面积只有十三点二平方公里，现在城市的“架子”撑到方圆七十平方公里（不连三个工人镇）；城市实际用地，也已经有四十一点二平方公里；按照原来的远景规划，城市用地面积甚至还要发展到一百三十一平方公里呢！
    有了大规模，就有高标准，这是姊妹两个。这两个东西在思想上是一脉相传的。同时，城市大了，在客观上也促使一些建设的标准高起来。西安市在解放以后新建的住宅，三层和三层以上的楼房占67％，而且全部楼房都有水电设备，每平方公尺的造价都在五十元以上，比旧城原有住宅造价约高一倍。新建的影剧院、商店，许多都造价太贵。公用事业工程有的也标准过高。部分道路修的过宽过早，有些排水工程没有因陋就简，基本建设投资达一百二十五万元的污水处理厂，现在看来就可以缓建。这几年，全市还拆了三十三万平方公尺的房屋，1956年一年就拆了十五万平方公尺，其中有一部分拆的过早过多。
    各方面求大求新，追求大规模、高标准的结果，便浪费了国家不少建设资金。从1949年到现在，西安市城市建设各方面的投资总计约为三亿元。据估算，如果原来就按照因陋就简、勤俭建国的精神来使用这些资金，节约20％以上是可能的。
    更值得注意的是，由于规模大，标准高，没有能用同样的资金办更多的事情，职工生活方面有些问题就没有能很好地解决。例如，1951年，西安市只有十七辆公共汽车，1956年增加到九十八辆，但是因为人口增加的快，城市的摊子铺的大，公共交通还很拥挤。从解放到1956年底，西安市新建住宅的面积相当于原有住宅的一倍多，可是每个人平均的居住面积，却由刚解放时的二点九平方公尺下降到二点六平方公尺。如果原来把建筑标准降低一些，自然可以修建更多的房子。由此可见，大规模，高标准，既多花了钱，又制造了人为的矛盾！
    空想的“社会主义标准”
    为什么会盲目地求大求新呢？
    关于这个问题，记者曾请教了陕西省城市建设局局长兼西安市城市建设局局长李廷弼同志。他说：“除了没有经验和某些本位主义以外，主要是我们思想上有一个空想的、不切实际的‘社会主义标准’在作怪。”李廷弼同志还对这一点作了生动具体的分析。
    他说：我们都有那么一股建设社会主义城市的热情，但是对社会主义城市是个什么样子，却没有一个完整的具体的概念。而是懵懵懂懂地认为，社会主义城市总是一切比过去好的多。一想就是大呀，好呀，高标准呀，现代化呀，好像只有这样才是社会主义城市。1954年以后，大批工厂、学校涌到西安来的时候，我们就没有提出控制规模等意见。我们不但希望建设的规模大，数量多，而且希望建设的标准高。东、西郊一些职工宿舍水电俱全，只是没有暖气设备，我们就嫌不够好！
    李廷弼同志打趣地说：“这种搞法，伟大是伟大，好也是好，可惜就是不合乎中国的国情，和我们当前的情况不相称！”接着，他说：“这就叫脱离实际，脱离群众，过去城市建设中的缺点、错误，毛病都出在这里。”
    依照这个论点，他进一步发挥说：所谓“实际”，一是国家的经济条件，二是人民的生活水平，三是当地的地形、地貌。我们国家的特点是人多地少，经济落后，人民生活水平不高。这是一切建设的出发点。拿住宅来说，为了把国家有限的资金使用在最必需的地方，为了解决多数人的问题，我们现在就可以多修建一些造价便宜、整洁适用的低层建筑。同资本主义国家比较起来，我们虽然没有那么多的为少数人服务的摩天大楼，但是我们的劳动人民都有房子住，而且住的不是腌臜的贫民窟。这就比资本主义强，这也就是社会主义的优越性。我们社会主义城市的任务，就是为生产服务，为劳动人民服务。因此，在我看来，从我国当前的经济条件出发，因陋就简，勤俭建设，也就是社会主义标准。
    几点值得重视的意见
    根据西安市的情况来看，今后在城市建设工作中应该吸取哪些经验教训呢？据研究这个问题的一些同志谈论：今后需要注意下列几点：
    （一）城市规模不宜过大，最好依靠原有中小城镇，建设一些一、二十万人口的工业城市。这样可以节约大量城市建设费用。这个问题的关键，在于国家安排工业项目不要过分集中。
    （二）不论大小城市，最好都是逐步发展，不宜一下建设太多的项目。分期分片逐步建设，许多事情可以缓办，这便有利于资金的周转。
    （三）民用建筑和公用事业工程应当尽量因陋就简。住宅、公共服务设施可以就地取材，多建低标准的、简易的建筑。道路、供水、排水工程可以降低标准，并应尽可能地少建，缓建。这样既可以节约资金，又可以更多地满足群众的迫切需要。
    （四）加强建筑管理。目前省、市难以控制的民用建筑标准，中央有关部门应该制定办法，责成省、市加以管理、监督。
    （五）城市规划应该切实注意结合当地情况。每人居住面积定额，就可以根据各地人口规模、工业布局、地形地貌等条件，分别按三平方公尺、四点五平方公尺、六平方公尺等进行规划。其他城市规划定额和防空、防火、卫生等标准，不切合实际的，也希望中央有关部门加以修改。
    我想，上述这些意见似乎可以供城市建设部门作为改进工作的参考。
