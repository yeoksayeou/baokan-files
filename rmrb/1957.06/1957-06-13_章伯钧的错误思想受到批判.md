Zhang Bojun's Erroneous Ideas Criticized

Wang Chenxin and Zhang Shenfu Disagree with Everyone's Criticism of Zhang Bojun

Zhang Bojun Hopes that Conclusions About His Mistakes Will Be Reached More Slowly

(Our Newspaper) News: The Central Committee (Enlarged) of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party continued to hold a symposium yesterday afternoon. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Zhang Bojun. Those who spoke at the meeting included Huang Qixiang, Yang Qingyuan, Yan Xinmin, Luo Renyi, Li Boqiu, Wang Chenxin, and Zhang Shenfu. With the exception of Huang Qixiang's speech, the other speeches were related to Zhang Bojun's past remarks. Most people criticized some of Zhang Bojun's past remarks, while some people expressed support for Zhang Bojun. Before the meeting ended, Zhang Bojun expressed his attitude and opinions on counter-criticism and read a letter from Zhang Yunchuan to Li Boqiu.

Yang Qingyuan believes that Zhang Bojun opposes the leadership of the Communist Party from the perspective of working methods, and Chu Anping opposes the leadership of the Communist Party from the perspective of personnel arrangements. The errors are equally serious.

After Huang Qixiang's speech, Yang Qingyuan first criticized Zhang Bojun's erroneous remarks. He said that Zhang Bojun's remarks have a revisionist tendency. Zhang Bojun has participated in the discussion and formulation of various national policies, but saying that the Communist Party has not discussed all major measures with democratic parties is not in accordance with the facts. He believes that Zhang Bojun opposes the leadership of the Communist Party from the perspective of the Communist Party's working methods, which is as serious as Chu Anping's opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party from the perspective of personnel arrangements. Then, he raised two points of opinion to Zhang Bojun. He said, does Zhang Bojun's so-called "Political Design Institute" have the idea of excluding and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party? Should he examine whether he has old democratic ideas? Secondly, Zhang Bojun's erroneous thinking has a long history and did not start now. After he returned from abroad this year, he revealed in his words that he thought the Communist Party was undemocratic. He said at the party meeting in March: If a person is only allowed to live in a Western-style house, ride in a car, wear a woolen uniform, and eat delicacies, but is not allowed to think independently, it will also cause a revolution. This also fully expresses his dissatisfaction with the Party.

Yan Xinmin said: Zhang Bojun has often shown wavering in his words or thoughts over the years.

Following Yan Xinmin's speech, he said: Zhang Bojun's article published in today's Guangming Daily requires everyone to stand firm on the socialist position, obey the leadership of the Party, and resolutely fight against the rightists and a very small number of hidden counter-revolutionaries, which is completely correct. The regret is that he does not pay enough attention to the seriousness of his past erroneous remarks. Because he is not an ordinary democratic person, he holds a leading position in democratic parties, the Central People's Government, and even the Guangming Daily. Although Zhang Bojun's motives for speaking are good, the mistakes are also serious. Then, Yan Xinmin listed the facts and criticized Zhang Bojun's so-called "Political Design Institute," the issue of submitting finished products first when discussing things at the State Council meeting, and the fact that the reform of the written language was not discussed by everyone. He also said: Any errors in political opinion are not accidental. Under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Bojun, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party has accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party politically from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the present, and has not made major mistakes in the political line; however, Zhang Bojun personally has often shown wavering in his words or thoughts over the years. For example, he often talked about changing the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference into a "bicameral system" not long ago, which was the pursuit of the parliamentary political system of the British and American bourgeoisie. Yan Xinmin believes that the root of this wavering is, on the one hand, the class root, that is, the petty-bourgeois or bourgeois ideology; on the other hand, the historical root, that is, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party once took the third road or the middle road in history.

When criticizing Chu Anping's absurd theory of "the Party's world," Luo Renyi put forward two points for everyone to pay attention to. He said: First, Chu Anping's words were spoken in the capacity of the editor-in-chief of "Guangming Daily"; second, some people said that Chu Anping's words were not just his personal opinions, and someone supported him behind him. Comrade Zhang Bojun is the president of the "Guangming Daily" and should be especially careful about this.

Li Boqiu said: On some key political issues, Zhang Bojun often promotes or conforms to the activities of right-wing elements.

In his speech, Li Boqiu put forward the following views on the "Political Design Institute" and other issues mentioned by Zhang Bojun: If it is viewed from the perspective of improving the way of working under the premise of the Communist Party's leadership and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, it is worth discussing. Unfortunately, Zhang Bojun's speech is very vague on this point, which is difficult to understand. Li Boqiu said: Zhang Bojun led our party to cooperate with the Communist Party in the past, and then accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and embarked on the road of socialism. In the future, he will further guide our party to make greater contributions to the socialist cause under the leadership of the Communist Party. Starting from cherishing the socialist cause and cherishing the leaders of our party, we should sincerely criticize Comrade Bojun. In our party's work, Comrade Bojun has always moved towards socialism, but he has less theoretical research on problems, he has the idea of ​​a "bicameral system"; he is too subjective and emotional in dealing with practical problems; he also has dualistic elements in his position and basic viewpoints, and he does not pay enough attention to the opinions of the revolutionary masses, and he often underestimates the mainstream of the revolutionary masses; he overestimates the rightists, takes too much care of them, indulges them, and does not draw a clear line with them ideologically and politically, and does not take the method of both struggle and unity. On some key political issues, he often promotes or conforms to the activities of right-wing elements.

Wang Chenxin said: None of Zhang Bojun's speeches contained errors of principle.

Wang Chenxin put forward different opinions on the speeches of some people at the meeting. He said: First, Zhang Bojun's opinion that the State Council's discussion of issues first produces finished products is formalistic, I think it is not completely appropriate; but Yang Qingyuan said that his opinion is old democratic thinking, I also disagree. What is old democracy? It is false democracy, democracy that deceives the people, and in fact the people have no democratic rights. The opinion raised by Zhang Bojun is not to pursue such false democracy. Second, some people say that Zhang Bojun said that the reform of the written language was not discussed, and some people also said that this is not the fact. In fact, what was discussed was the text plan for reforming the written language, and whether or not to reform the written language was indeed not discussed. Third, some people say that Zhang Bojun's proposed "Political Design Institute" has the idea of ​​breaking away from the leadership of the Communist Party, and I also disagree. The design institute is a staff agency, not a leading agency. The Ministry of Railways and other ministries all have design institutes. Does that mean that these ministries are breaking away from the leadership of the Communist Party? Fourth, some people say that Zhang Bojun speaks too casually, and I also disagree. Casual talk between comrades should not be cited as the basis for criticism. Comrades should not show a serious face in conversations, making people unpredictable, just like some people criticize certain Communist Party members. Zhang Bojun has shortcomings, this is a fact. He is the highest leading comrade of our party. A tall tree catches the wind. It is not good to talk casually. However, this shortcoming should not be raised too high. Fifth, Luo Renyi said that someone said that Chu Anping was supported by someone behind him and asked Comrade Zhang Bojun to be careful. I think: People can say that, we can ignore it. Chu Anping holds many important positions and is not a three-year-old child. Does he need someone to support him when he speaks? That would be too ridiculous and naive. Sixth, Li Boqiu said that Zhang Bojun is wavering, and I don't completely agree. Zhang Bojun is a bit casual on small matters, but he never wavers on big matters. He cited Zhang Bojun's refusal of Chiang Kai-shek's temptation during the Anti-Japanese War as an example.

He said that in my personal view, Comrade Zhang Bojun's speeches have some problems, but none of them contain errors of principle. Therefore, we should discuss them gently and carefully, and should not raise them to the level of principle all at once. If we are not realistic, everything will be messed up.

Zhang Shenfu said: Zhang Bojun's speech was too casual, and he didn't think too much when he spoke. He believes that Zhang Bojun's position is not 100% firm, but it is 95% firm; regarding Zhang Bojun's proposal to organize a "Political Design Institute," he believes that it is still worth considering.

Zhang Bojun's Speech

Zhang Bojun made a speech before the symposium ended. He said: "Today is the first time I have participated in the symposium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Yesterday I considered the criticisms of me from all aspects of friends and wanted to make a speech and make a review. This morning, I made an appointment with Huang Qixiang to ask him about the meeting procedures and asked if I could speak. Huang Qixiang told me to listen to everyone's opinions first.

"On the 9th, I had a conversation at a symposium of the China Democratic League. Today I published an editorial on the Guangming Daily, and I also wrote an article entitled "The China Democratic League Should Take the Socialist Road" to talk about what the trend of the Democratic League is. The manuscript has been sent to the Guangming Daily, but because it was not written very carefully, it was withdrawn.

"My spirit is like this. I welcome all friends who care about me to criticize me ideologically and in style, so that I can know the extent of my mistakes. My position is different. I have served in the party for a long time. I welcome all well-intentioned criticisms. I am very grateful to all the comrades who have criticized me today. I am not trying to conceal my mistakes, but I want to learn democracy and have the demeanor of "moving my heart and enduring my nature."

"I have spoken three times in the past. Once I spoke at the Ministry of Communications, which has been published in the People's Daily and the Highway News; and twice at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department. Once I spoke on behalf of the Democratic League, and once I expressed my personal opinions. I think that in these meetings I have talked about the "Political Design Institute," the process of the State Council meeting to produce finished products, and the issue of language reform. In addition, I mentioned that the various offices and committees under the State Council should be changed, and the power should be placed in the various ministries and commissions to give full play to the role of management agencies. The main reason for discussing these issues is that I personally want to make a contribution to the country; but some friends have accused me of being wrong.

"I have opinions on these issues, not based on inspiration and temporary pleasure; but I am not detailed enough. It may be that I have made the mistake of opposing the proletarian dictatorship, violating the leadership of the Party, and taking the capitalist road; but this mistake should be concluded after I have explained it, which is more in line with the spirit of democracy. I also said in the Democratic League group meeting that my mistakes may be very serious, or they may not be so serious, but I will not argue. Because arguing immediately is tantamount to resisting criticism, which is not in line with the spirit of democracy. Playing ball has rules, you hit it, I hit it.

"What exactly is the political design institute? I haven't explained it myself yet. This is a serious problem. Therefore, I still hope that comrades will continue to put forward opinions. I want to test myself, use the effort of "moving my heart and enduring my nature" to restrain myself and exercise democratic demeanor. Please be my teacher. Only Huang Qixiang did not involve my issue at today's meeting, which is a pity." (At this time, Huang Qixiang interjected: "I haven't thought it through.") Zhang Bojun continued, saying that he hasn't said what the political design institute is yet. (At this time, Huang Qixiang interjected again: "So I can't offer any opinions.") Zhang Bojun continued: "My political design institute may be a representative error. Recently, a friend told me that many schools and institutions have proposed to participate in "from design to construction" and to have the Party withdraw from schools and other absurd remarks, which seems to be similar to the political design institute issue I have mentioned. After everyone has finished talking, I will think maturely and then talk or write articles."

After Zhang Bojun finished speaking, he read a letter from Zhang Yunchuan, who is in Zhengzhou to develop organizations for the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, to Li Boqiu. The letter also specified that it should be shown to Zhang Bojun. The general idea of ​​Zhang Yunchuan's letter is: "Seeing the news about the symposium of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in the People's Daily and the Guangming Daily, I saw that the content was not to offer opinions to the Communist Party and help rectify the style, but turned into offering opinions to Zhang Yunchuan and became the rectification of the style of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Party, which is very strange! You asked me to come to Zhengzhou to do things, but you criticized me when I was not present and did not have the opportunity to speak, which also makes people feel that."

Zhang Bojun said, "Regarding Zhang Yunchuan's letter, I would like to explain: First, it is not the rectification of the style within the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, but to help the CCP rectify the style. He also has the opportunity to come back and explain, and has democratic equal rights. Please ask the Secretariat to write to him and tell him to work with peace of mind. Second, the issue of our party's rectification of the style is still in accordance with the spirit of the agreement between the democratic parties and the CCP. We only help the CCP rectify the style. Our party will not rectify the style for the time being, and we will talk about it in the future. Criticizing me now is to correct the deviations that occurred in helping the CCP rectify the style. Like playing ball, you can only hit one ball at a time. If you hit another ball at the same time, you will mess up. Thank you for your speeches and your advice to me."

At this symposium, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Yan Xinmin, Luo Renyi, and Zhang Shenfu also criticized how to help the CCP rectify the style and some erroneous remarks. Huang Qixiang said that he hoped that the leaders of Renmin University and the education department would learn enough lessons from Ge Peiqi's anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks. Huang Qixiang also said that Chu Anping and Chen Xingui's absurd statements could not find a market. He focused on criticizing Chen Xingui's fallacies and expressed his disagreement with Zhang Yunchuan's erroneous remarks.

Li Boqiu, Luo Renyi, Zhang Shenfu, and Yan Xinmin also criticized Chu Anping and Chen Xingui's strange theories.

### 章伯钧的错误思想受到批判

　　在农工民主党中央委员会座谈会上
　　章伯钧的错误思想受到批判
　　王忱心张申府不同意大家对章伯钧的批评
　　章伯钧希望对他的错误慢些作结论
    本报讯  中国农工民主党中央委员会（扩大）昨天下午继续举行座谈会。会议由章伯钧主席主持。在会上发言的有黄琪翔、杨清源、严信民、罗任一、李伯球、王忱心、张申府等七人。除黄琪翔的发言以外，其他发言都是同章伯钧过去发表的言论有关的。多数人对章伯钧过去的一些言论作了批判，同时，也有人提出了支持章伯钧的意见。会议结束前，章伯钧在会上表示了对于反批评的态度和意见，并宣读了张云川给李伯球的一封来信。
    杨清源认为章伯钧从工作方法上反对共产党领导，储安平从人事安排上反对共产党领导，错误同样严重。
    在黄琪翔发言后，杨清源首先对章伯钧的错误言论提出了批评。他说，章伯钧的言论有修正主义的倾向。章伯钧参加过国家各项政策的讨论和制定，却说共产党对一切重大措施未经过民主党派讨论，是不合事实的。他认为，章伯钧是从共产党的工作方法上反对共产党的领导，与储安平是从人事安排上反对共产党的领导，同样严重。接着，他对章伯钧提出了两点意见。他说，章伯钧所谓“政治设计院”的提法，是否有排斥和反对共产党领导的思想？是否有旧民主主义思想，应该自己检查一下。其次，章伯钧这种错误思想由来已久，不是从现在开始。今年他从国外回来以后，在言谈中就流露了认为共产党不民主的意见。他在3月间党的会议上说：对一个人，只让他住洋房、坐小汽车、穿呢制服、吃山珍海味，不许他独立思考，也会引起革命的。这也充分表示他对党的不满。
    严信民说：章伯钧多少年来在言谈或思想上常常表现动摇。
    接着发言的是严信民，他说：章伯钧在今天光明日报上发表的文章中要大家站稳社会主义立场，服从党的领导并坚决对右派和极少数暗藏的反革命分子进行斗争，这是完全正确的。遗憾的是他对自己过去的错误言论的严重性重视不够。由于他不是一个普通的民主人士，他在民主党派、中央人民政府以至光明日报，都居于领导人的地位。尽管章伯钧说话的动机是好的，但是错误也是严重的。然后，严信民就章伯钧所说的“政治设计院”、国务院会议上讨论事情时先交出成品的问题以及文字改革未经大家讨论等问题，都列举事实，进行了批判。并说：任何政治意见上的错误，都不会是偶然的。农工民主党在章伯钧同志领导下从抗战期间一直到现在，在政治上接受了中国共产党的领导，在政治路线上没有犯过大的错误；但是，章伯钧个人，多少年来在言谈或思想上，却常常表现了动摇。如不久前他曾常谈到的改人大和政协为“两院制”，那是追求英美资产阶级的议会政治制度。严信民认为，这种动摇的根源，一方面是阶级根源，即小资产阶级或资产阶级思想；另一方面是历史根源，即农工民主党在历史上曾经走第三条道路或中间路线。
    罗任一在批判储安平的“党天下”的怪论时，提出两点要大家注意。他说：第一，储安平的话是以“光明日报”总编辑的身份讲的；第二，有人讲，储安平的话不只是他个人的意见，他背后有人支持。章伯钧同志是“光明日报”社的社长，对这应该特别小心。
    李伯球说：在一些政治关键问题上章伯钧常常助长或符合右派分子的活动。
    李伯球在发言中，对章伯钧所说的“政治设计院”等问题提出了这样的看法：如果是从在共产党领导、巩固人民民主专政的前提下，提出改进工作的方式方法的角度来看，是值得讨论的。可惜章伯钧的发言对这一点说得很模糊，是令人难以理解的。李伯球说：章伯钧过去领导我党同共产党合作，进而接受共产党领导，走上社会主义道路，今后还要进一步引导我党在共产党领导下对社会主义事业作出更大的贡献。从爱护社会主义事业、爱护我党的领导人出发，我们应该忠诚地对伯钧同志提出批评。在我们党的工作中，伯钧同志一向是朝社会主义走，但是，他从理论上钻研问题的时候少，他有“两院制”思想；在处理实际问题时过于凭主观感情出发；在立场上、基本观点上也有二元论的成分，对革命群众的意见不够重视，对革命群众的主流常常估计不足；对右派估计过高，照顾、纵容太多，没有同他们从思想上、政治上划清界线，没有采取又斗争又团结的办法，在一些政治关键问题上，常常助长或符合右派分子的活动。
    王忱心说：章伯钧的发言没有一条是原则性的错误。
    王忱心在发言中对会上某些人士的发言提出了不同的意见。他说：一，章伯钧关于国务院讨论事情先拿出成品是形式主义的意见，我认为是不完全妥当；可是，杨清源说，他提这样的意见就是旧民主主义思想，我也不同意。什么是旧民主主义呢？是假民主，欺骗人民的民主，实际上人民没有民主权利。章伯钧提的意见，并不是要这样的假民主。二、章伯钧说文字改革没有经过讨论，也有人说这不是事实。其实，讨论过的是改革文字的文字方案，至于“文字要不要改革”，的确是没有经过讨论的。三、有人说，章伯钧提出的“政治设计院”，有脱离共产党领导的思想，我也不同意。设计院是参谋机构，并不是领导机构。铁道部和其他各部都有设计院，难道这些部就是脱离共产党的领导了？四、有人说章伯钧说话太随便，我也不同意。同志间随便谈的话，不应该引为批评的根据。同志间谈话本来就不该摆出严肃面孔，使人莫测高深，就像有些人批评某些共产党员的那样子。章伯钧有缺点，这是事实。他是我们党的最高领导同志，树大招风，随便谈话是有些不好。但是，也不能把这缺点提得太高。五、罗任一说，有人说储安平背后有人支持，要章伯钧同志小心。我认为：人家可以那样说，我们可以不理。储安平身兼数要职，又不是三岁小孩，说话还需要谁来支持他，那就太可笑太幼稚了。六、李伯球说章伯钧摇摆不定，我也不完全同意。章伯钧在小事上是有些随随便便，在大事上是从来不动摇的。他举出章伯钧在抗日时期曾拒绝蒋介石的引诱，作为例证。
    他说，我个人看，章伯钧同志的发言，多少有些问题，可是没有一条是有原则性错误的。因此，应该和风细雨地商讨，不可一下子提高到原则上来看。如果不实事求是，一切都要乱了。
    张申府说：章伯钧的发言太随便，说话不太多考虑。他认为章伯钧的立场不够百分之百坚定，但也够百分之九十五的坚定；关于章伯钧所说的组织“政治设计院”的意见，他认为还是值得考虑的。
　　章伯钧的发言
    在座谈会结束前，章伯钧作了发言。他说：“我今天是第一次参加农工民主党的座谈会。昨天我就考虑了各方面的朋友对我的批评，想作一次发言，作个检查。今天上午约黄琪翔到我家里问他开会的程序，问我可否发言。黄琪翔让我先听听大家的意见。
      “9日我在中国民主同盟的座谈会上有个谈话，今天我在光明日报上发表了一篇代论，另外还写了一篇文章，题目是“中国民主同盟要走社会主义道路”，谈民盟动向究竟是什么。稿子已送光明日报，因写得不十分周到，又抽回来了。
      “我的精神如此，欢迎所有爱护我的朋友，从思想上、作风上对我批评，让我知道错误到什么程度。我的地位不同，在党内服务很久，欢迎一切善意的批评。今天所有的同志对我都有批评，非常感谢。我不是文过饰非，而是要学习民主，要有“动心忍性”的风度。
      “我过去发言有三次，一次是在交通部谈话，人民日报上已登，在公路报上也登了；另外在统战部召开的座谈会上有两次谈话，一次是代表民盟谈话，一次是发表我个人的意见。我认为在这几次会议上曾经谈到‘政治设计院’、国务院会议程序拿出成品和文字改革问题，此外提到国务院机构下的各办各委应当改变，权放在各部会，多发挥管理机构的作用。谈这些问题主要是个人想对国家提出贡献；可是有些朋友们指责我说错了。
      “对这些问题我是有意见的，不是凭灵感和一时高兴；但是语焉不详。可能是犯了反对无产阶级专政、违背党的领导，走资本主义道路的错误；但这错误要等我加以说明以后再作结论，这才比较合乎民主精神。我在民盟小组会上也说过我犯错误可能很严重，也可能不那么严重，但不作辩论。因为，马上就辩论，就等于抗拒批评，不合民主精神。打球有球规，你打来，我打去。
    “政治设计院到底是什么东西？我自己还没加以说明，这是个严重的问题。因此还希望同志们继续提意见，我要考验自己，用‘动心忍性’的功夫，克制自己，锻炼民主风度，请老师。今天会上只有黄琪翔没有涉及我的问题，美中不足。”（这时黄琪翔插话说：“没想好。”）章伯钧接着说，政治设计院到底是什么还没有说出来。（这时黄琪翔又插句话：“所以我不能提意见。”）章伯钧接着又说：“我那个政治设计院可能是有代表性的错误。最近有朋友告诉我，有许多的学校和机关的一些人提出来要参加‘从设计到施工’，要党退出学校这一类荒谬的言论，恰与我所说过的政治设计院问题，看起来有相似处。等大家谈完了，我思考成熟了，再谈或者写文章。”
    章伯钧说完话，又宣读了正在郑州为农工民主党发展组织的张云川寄给李伯球的一封信，信上并指明要给章伯老看一看。张云川的来信大意说：“看到人民日报和光明日报上登着农工民主党中央座谈的消息，一看内容，不是对共产党提意见，帮助整风，却变成了对张云川提意见，成为农工党整风，甚觉稀奇！你们要求我来郑州干事，在我不在座没有机会发言的情况之下来批评我，也令人很觉得那个。”
    章伯钧说，“对于张云川的来信，我想解释一下：第一，不是农工民主党党内整风，是帮助中共整风。他也有回来说明的机会，有民主的平等权利，请秘书处写信告诉他：安心工作。第二，我们党内整风的问题，仍然按照各民主党派同中共协议的精神，只帮助中共整风，我们党内暂不整风，将来再说。现在批评我，是纠正帮助中共整风中发生的偏差。像打球，一次只能打一个球，如果同时又打一个球，就打乱了。谢谢大家发言，对我的指教。”
    在这次座谈会上，黄琪翔、李伯球、严信民、罗任一、张申府等还对如何帮助中共整风，并且对一些错误的言论进行了批判。黄琪翔说，对于葛佩琦的反共反社会主义言论，希望人民大学和教育部门的领导人吸取足够的教训。黄琪翔还说，储安平和陈新桂的荒谬说法，是找不到市场的。他着重对陈新桂的谬论作了批判，并表示不同意张云川的错误言论。
    李伯球、罗任一和张申府、严信民等对储安平和陈新桂的怪论也提出了批判。
