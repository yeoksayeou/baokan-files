Another Blatant Manifestation of Attempting to Permanently Occupy Our Country's Territory
The United States Expands Naval and Air Force Bases in Taiwan

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: According to combined news from Taiwanese newspapers, the United States, under the guise of "promoting Taiwan's economic prosperity," is expanding Kaohsiung Harbor and Taipei's Songshan Airport.

The United States will allocate a large number of US dollars and plans to expand Kaohsiung Commercial Port into the largest US naval base in Taiwan within ten years, capable of docking 40,000-ton ships. The United States has already allocated ten million US dollars as the first year's expenditure for the expansion plan. The port's two major projects are being intensified under the supervision of American "experts," and it is expected that they will be fully completed by the end of June this year.

In addition, the main construction of the Songshan Civil Aviation Airport, which the United States renovated in northern Taiwan, has recently been completed, and it has become a so-called modern international standard airport of the American type. This airport can be converted into a new air force base for jet fighters and strategic bombers at any time. According to Taiwanese newspapers, the United States is now stepping up the expansion of Kaohsiung Port and Taipei's Songshan Airport in Taiwan entirely to achieve long-term "military purposes."

　　妄图永霸我国领土的又一露骨表现
　　美国在台湾扩建海空军基地
    据新华社14日讯　综合台湾报纸消息，美国在“繁荣台湾经济”的幌子下，正在扩建高雄海港和台北松山机场。
    美国将拨出大批美元，计划在十年内把高雄商港扩建为美国在台湾的最大的海军基地，可以停泊四万吨的舰船。现在美国已经拨款一千万美元作为扩建计划的第一年的用费，这个港口的两项主要工程正在美国“专家”的监督下加紧进行，预计今年6月底可全部竣工。
    此外，美国在台湾北部改建的松山民航机场的主要工程最近已经完工，它已成为美国型的所谓现代国际最标准的机场。这个机场可以随时改变成一个新的喷气战斗机和战略轰炸机空军基地。据台湾报纸透露，现在美国在台湾加紧扩建高雄港口和台北松山机场，完全是为了达到长远的“军事上的目的”。
