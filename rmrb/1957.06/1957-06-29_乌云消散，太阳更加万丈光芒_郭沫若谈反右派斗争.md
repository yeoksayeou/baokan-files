　　The Dark Clouds Disperse, the Sun Shines Even More Brilliantly
    Guo Moruo on the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    *Guangming Daily* reporter He Bingran reports: On the 27th, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave an important talk to reporters on the issues of resolutely repelling the bourgeois rightists' rampant attacks.
　　We Must Resolutely Repel the Rightists' Rampant Attacks
    Guo Moruo first emphasized: China is a large country, and the task of building our country is very arduous. The Chinese Communist Party is the leading party, the locomotive of our country. Therefore, it bears particularly heavy responsibilities. In the more than seven years since the founding of the country, our country has achieved great successes in politics, economics, and culture under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to carry out socialist construction better and faster in the future, not long ago, the Chinese Communist Party, with a highly responsible attitude, decided to rectify any possible undesirable work styles within the Party—namely, the work styles of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. At the same time, it sincerely encouraged non-Party members to offer criticisms to help with the rectification campaign, tearing down walls where there were walls and filling in ditches where there were ditches. This is entirely an attitude of selflessness, proceeding wholeheartedly from the interests of the people. If not for the Communist Party, who else could do this? However, some bourgeois rightists with ulterior motives attempted to steal the sky and change the day, and under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, launched a rampant attack on the Party and the socialist system. In the eyes of the rightists, this seemed like a golden opportunity. According to the rightists' estimation, the Communist Party is unpopular, and this "Party's world" will not last long. Therefore, they began to stir. They were so carried away that they thought they could create their own world. The rightists look at things with dark glasses, and everything, in their view, is pitch black. They completely obliterate the great achievements that the motherland has made in recent years under the leadership of the Communist Party. They expand individual phenomena into generalities, and by taking advantage of the shortcomings of individual party members, magnify them into the shortcomings of the entire party, painting the party as completely black. Some confused intellectuals also joined in the clamor, saying things like "now is worse than the Kuomintang era" and "intellectuals have suffered a catastrophe," which is simply lying with their eyes open. The rightists have only one goal: to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and restore capitalism. Any citizen with even a little patriotism cannot tolerate such a rampant attack by the bourgeois rightists. Under no circumstances can this situation be allowed to continue. And that is exactly what has happened. First, the worker-peasant masses, and then the broad masses of intellectuals, have resolutely counterattacked the rightists' rampant attacks. It is clear that the rightists are digging their own graves.
    Admittedly, in a short period of time, the various fallacies of the rightists once deceived some people and caused some confusion. But it was just like a few dark clouds, obscuring the sun for a moment. On the 19th, Chairman Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published, and on the 26th, Premier Zhou Enlai made a "Report on the Work of the Government" at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, based on the guidelines put forward in Chairman Mao's report. People have gained clear standards for distinguishing right from wrong, and they have also clearly seen how glorious and great the achievements that our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have made in recent years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are! It can be said with certainty that today it is already "clearing away the clouds and seeing the blue sky." The dark clouds have dissipated, and the sun shines even more brilliantly. Those who believe in socialism will become even more steadfast; those who were hesitant have gained a clear understanding. These two reports are good medicine for curing diseases, curing many people's diseases of doubt, wavering, and confusion. Of course, the situation may be different for rightists who are terminally ill. But as long as they are not willing to cut themselves off from the people, there is still hope. Didn't Premier Zhou make it very clear in his report? "We hope that, through the promotion of external forces, the experience of life, and their own awareness, the rightists can repent and accept reform. The door to socialist reform is open to them."
    Is it "Speech is a Crime"?
    Some people may still ask: Doesn't it say, "The speaker is not guilty, but the listener should take warning"? How can the speaker be guilty again? Speaking to this point, Guo Moruo emphasized: In fact, the answer to this question is very simple: "The speaker is not guilty if he is innocent; the speaker is still guilty if he is guilty." If a person's words shake the foundation of the country and are still innocent, then what national laws and disciplines are there to speak of? In my opinion, the saying "the speaker is not guilty, but the listener should take warning" has not been discounted at all today. Well-intentioned criticism, even if it is a bit harsh, should be accepted. It's like fragrant flowers, which often have thorns, like roses. We will never pull them out just because they have thorns. But if it is a poisonous weed, it has the freedom to sprout and grow, and we also have the freedom and responsibility to pull it out. The fields are for growing grain, not to mention poisonous weeds, even weeds should be pulled out.
    To counterattack the rightists, does it mean to "clamp down"? No! "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a long-term policy. Counterattacking the rightists is a major contention. Only by eradicating the poisonous weeds sprouted by the rightists can we better and more healthily implement the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." With the weeds removed, the flowers will bloom better. With the noise removed, the contention will be better. Furthermore, politically speaking, only by eradicating the poisonous weeds released by the rightists with ulterior motives can the democratic parties truly coexist for a long time under the leadership of the Communist Party and play a role of mutual supervision.
    Guo Moruo continued: At present, there are two things that must be clearly distinguished. One is the struggle against the rightists. This is a class struggle in politics and ideology. It must be carried out. Now, the large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle of the revolutionary period has basically ended, but the class struggle has not completely ended. The Chiang Kai-shek clique is still entrenched in Taiwan, American imperialism is still blockading our country, and there are still domestic counter-revolutionaries. As long as there is an opportunity, they will still stir up trouble. Even the current big shots of the rightists are in leading positions in the country, but given the opportunity, wouldn't they also spread poison and try to restore capitalism? Therefore, the class struggle has not ended, and even in a considerable period of time in the future, the class struggle will still be unavoidable. The struggle against the rightists is to defend the achievements of our socialist revolution and to ensure the building of a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    The other is to rectify undesirable work styles. Regarding rectification, not only is the Communist Party doing it, but many democratic parties are also starting to do it, which is a very good phenomenon. Rectification is a good way to correctly handle contradictions among the people. By adjusting work styles and eliminating problems, we can improve our work and better serve the socialist cause. The Chinese Communist Party is in the leading position in the country and bears a particularly heavy responsibility, so it must seriously rectify its work style. All democratic parties, and even every individual in the country, also bear the responsibility of building the country and should follow the example of the Communist Party, rectify their own work styles, and continue to carry out self-reform.
    Intellectuals Must Continue to Carry Out Ideological Remolding
    Some people say that as soon as they hear about ideological remolding, they think of "Qinghe labor reform." This kind of thinking that fears reform and resists reform is completely wrong. Everything in the universe is being transformed all the time, especially organisms, which are constantly undergoing metabolism. Who can refuse transformation? What's wrong with labor reform? It has turned many bad elements into new people, not to mention another kind of conscious ideological remolding that is completely different from "Qinghe labor reform." In my opinion, a person should carry out voluntary and conscious labor reform every day. Appropriate physical labor can not only make intellectuals healthy but also make their thinking healthy. Among intellectuals, including myself, many come from the old society, and there are still many old ideas in their minds. Seriously speaking, they must "undergo a complete transformation." How wonderful it would be if they could do that! I think most intellectuals welcome doing so. However, there are also some people who consider themselves extraordinary, act like super-masters, are unwilling to carry out reform, despise everything, and denounce everything. In fact, such people are nothing more than frogs in a well, and what they know is very limited. It is very dangerous for such people to always adhere to the attitude of a super-master. They can easily degenerate into the mud pit of the reactionaries. Therefore, we should advise those people to lower their airs, quickly awaken their consciousness, and carry out ideological remolding. In principle, ideological remolding should be gentle and gradual. However, in case other people's criticism is not so gentle and the rain is not so light, the person being criticized should also endure it. In fact, no matter how gentle the wind, it will still move the hair; no matter how light the rain, it will still wet the clothes. If a person is truly determined to serve the people wholeheartedly, even if there is a strong wind and heavy rain, wouldn't it be more pleasant as long as the mud on their body can be washed clean? "A prodigal son who returns is more precious than gold."
    Finally, Guo Moruo said: Here, I would also like to mention the problem of a small number of young students in individual schools being deceived. Young people are rich in emotions, have little experience, and are easily deceived. Therefore, when the rightists carried out their malicious instigation, a small number of people wavered and even succumbed to temptation and followed suit. This is certainly a mistake. However, making a mistake can turn into a good thing as long as they are willing to correct it. Especially young people, generally speaking, are relatively pure, not deeply poisoned, and easy to cure. As the saying goes, "A prodigal son who returns is more precious than gold." That's the idea. Therefore, at present, as long as a patriotic youth can distinguish right from wrong, stand firm, resolutely draw a clear line with the bourgeois rightists, and forever follow the Chinese Communist Party and march towards socialism, their future has unlimited prospects!

### 乌云消散，太阳更加万丈光芒  郭沫若谈反右派斗争

　　乌云消散，太阳更加万丈光芒
    郭沫若谈反右派斗争
    光明日报记者何炳然报道　27日，中国科学院院长郭沫若，就坚决回击资产阶级右派分子猖狂进攻等问题，对记者发表了重要的谈话。
　　必须坚决回击右派分子的猖狂进攻
    郭沫若首先强调指出：中国是一个大国，我们国家的建设任务非常繁重。而中国共产党是领导党，是我们国家的火车头。因此，它所担负的责任就特别重大。建国七年多以来，我们国家在中国共产党领导下，无论在政治、经济、文化各个方面，都已经取得了伟大的成就。为了今后能够更好、更快地进行社会主义建设，不久以前，中国共产党又抱着十分负责的态度，要对党内可能有的不良作风——即官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的作风，进行整肃，同时，也诚恳地鼓励党外人士提出批评，帮助整风，有墙拆墙，有沟填沟。这完全是一种大公无私、全心全意从人民利益出发的态度。要不是共产党，谁还能做到这样呢？但是，别有用心的资产阶级右派分子企图偷天换日，竟假借帮助党整风的名义，对党、对社会主义制度进行了猖狂的进攻。在右派分子看来，这好像是千载难逢的机会。根据右派分子的估计，共产党是不得人心的，这个“党天下”是不会长久的。因此，他们开始蠢动了。他们得意忘形地以为这样就可以打出他们的天下了。右派分子是带着黑眼镜来看事物的，一切事物，在他们看来，都是一片墨黑。他把祖国几年来在共产党领导下所取得的伟大成就一笔抹煞。他们把个别现象扩大成为一般，借着个别党员的一些缺点，扩大成为整个党的缺点，把党涂成漆黑一团。有些糊涂的知识分子也在跟着嚷，说什么“现在不如国民党时代”呀，“知识分子遭了浩劫”呀，简直是睁着眼睛说瞎话。右派的目的只有一个，就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，让资本主义复辟。只要稍具爱国心的公民，对于资产阶级右派分子这种猖狂的进攻，是绝对不能容忍的。这种情况，无论如何是不能任其发展下去的。事实也正是这样，首先是工农群众，其次是广大知识分子，他们已经对右派分子的猖狂进攻进行了坚决的回击。形势很明显，右派分子是在挖掘自己的墓坑。
    诚然，在一个短时期内，右派分子的种种谬论，曾经哄骗了一些人，引起了一些紊乱。但是，它只像一团团乌云，把太阳遮了一下。19日毛泽东主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”公布了，26日周恩来总理更根据毛主席的报告所提出的方针在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上作了“政府工作报告”。人们得到了辨别是非的明确的标准，也清楚地看到了几年来，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，在中国共产党领导下所取得的成就，是多么地光辉和伟大！可以肯定地说，今天已经是“拨开云雾见青天”了。乌云消散，太阳更加光芒万丈。相信社会主义的人会更加坚定；半信半疑的人有了明确的认识。这两个报告是治病的良药，治好了很多人的怀疑病、动摇病和糊涂病。当然，病入膏肓的右派分子，情况可能不同一些。但是，只要不甘自绝于人民，希望还是有的。周总理在报告中不是已经说得很明白吗？“我们希望，经过外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够憣然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的。”
    是不是“言者有罪”了呢？
    可能还有人这样问：不是说，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”吗？怎么言者又有罪了呢？谈到这里，郭沫若加重语气地说：实际上，答复这个问题很简单：“无罪者的言者无罪；有罪者的言者还是有罪的”。一个人的话，如果动摇了国家的根本，还是无罪，那样还有什么国家法纪可言呢？在我看来，今天“言者无罪，闻者足戒”这句话，仍然一点也没有打折扣。善意的批评，就是说得苛刻一点，也是要被接受的。这好比香花，每每有刺，比如蔷薇，我们决不会因为它有刺就要把它拔除。但如果是株毒草，它有冒头生长的自由，我们也有拔除的自由和责任。田地是要种粮食的，不要说毒草，就是杂草也应该拔除。
    反击右派，是不就是“收”？不是！“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是长期的政策。反击右派是大争。只有把右派分子茁发出来的毒草铲除干净，才能更好地更健康地贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。杂草除尽，花会开得更好。杂响除尽，鸣会争得更好。再从政治上来说，也只有把右派分子散放出来的别有用心的毒草铲除干净，各民主党派才能真正在共产党领导下，长期共存，发挥互相监督的作用。
    郭沫若继续说：目前，有两件事是必须区分清楚的。一件是对右派分子的斗争。这是一场政治上、思想上的阶级斗争。是必须进行的。现在，革命时期大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争虽已基本结束，但是，阶级斗争并没有完全结束。蒋介石集团还盘踞在台湾，美帝国主义还封锁着我们的国门，国内反革命分子也还有。只要有机会，他们还是要蠢动的。即如目前右派分子的大头目们，他们都是居于国家领导者的地位的，但是，一有机会，不也就要散播毒素，要让资本主义复辟吗？所以，阶级斗争并没有完结，即使在今后一个相当长的时期内，阶级斗争也仍然是不可避免的。对右派分子的斗争，是要保卫我们社会主义革命的成果，是要保证在共产党领导下建成社会主义社会。
    另一件是整顿不好的作风。关于整风，不但共产党要做，目前许多民主党派也在开始做，这是很好的现象。整风是正确处理人民内部矛盾的好方法。把作风调整好，把毛病祛除，就可以改进工作，更好地为社会主义事业服务。中国共产党处于国家领导的地位，责任特别重大，所以要认真地整风。各民主党派，以至于全国各个个人，也都负有建国的责任，也应该向共产党看齐，整自己的风，继续不断地进行自我改造。
    知识分子必须继续进行思想改造
    有人说，一听见思想改造，就想起“清河劳改”。这种怕改造抗拒改造的思想是完全错误的。宇宙间任何东西时时刻刻都在改造，特别是有机体是不断地在新陈代谢的。谁能拒绝改造？劳改有什么不好呢？它使许多坏分子变成了新人，何况是跟“清河劳改”完全不同的另一种自觉的思想改造。在我的想法，一个人倒应天天进行自愿自觉的劳改，适当进行体力劳动，对于知识分子不仅可以使身体健康，而且可以使思想健康。在知识分子中，包含我自己在内很多都是从旧社会来的，脑子里还有很多旧思想，认真说，必须“脱胎换骨”。能够做到，那是多么好啊！我想，多数知识分子是欢迎这样做的。但是，也有那么一部分人，他们自命不凡，以超级老爷自居，不乐意进行改造，藐视一切，骂倒一切。实际上，那种人不外是井底蛙，他所知道的东西，有限得很。那种人如果永远坚持超级老爷的态度，是很危险的。他很容易堕落到反动派的泥坑里去。因此，我们倒要奉劝那些人把架子放低一些，赶快启发自觉，进行思想改造。在原则上，思想改造应该是和风细雨式的。但是，万一别人的批评，风不那么和，雨不那么细，在被批评的人，也应该忍受。事实上，风再和，也要吹动头发；雨再细，也要打湿衣裳。一个人如果真正下决心全心全意为人民服务，即使大风大雨，只要能把身上的污泥洗得干净，不是更痛快的吗？“浪子回心一片宝”
    最后，郭沫若说：在这里，我还想提一提个别学校里少数青年学生受了蒙蔽的问题。年青人，富于感情，阅历不深，易受蒙蔽。因此，当右派分子进行别有用心的煽动的时候，有小部分人就动摇起来，甚至受了诱惑，跟着蠢动。这当然是犯了错误。但是，犯了错误，只要勇于纠正，又可以变成好事。特别是年青人，一般地说，比较纯洁，受了毒，也不很深，容易医好。俗话说：“浪子回心一片宝”。就是这个道理。所以，在目前，作为一个爱国的青年，只要能够辨明是非、站稳立场，坚决同资产阶级右派分子划清界限，永远跟着中国共产党走，走向社会主义，他们的前途是有无限的光明的！
