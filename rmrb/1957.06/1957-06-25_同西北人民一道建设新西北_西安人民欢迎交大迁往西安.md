Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd. The delegates attending the Second Session of the Second Xi'an Municipal People's Congress wrote a letter on the 22nd on behalf of the more than 1.3 million people of Xi'an to all faculty, staff, and students of Jiaotong University, welcoming them to relocate to Xi'an in its entirety.

The letter stated: Last year, part of Jiaotong University had already moved to Xi'an. The faculty, staff, and students overcame many difficulties and started classes as scheduled. This has already had a positive impact and good effect on the industrial and cultural construction of the Northwest. This enthusiasm for supporting the construction of the Northwest, the valuable spirit of overcoming difficulties, and the actions taken, have greatly excited and encouraged us. We would like to express our deep concern, sympathy, and respect to you. In the past year, our concern for Jiaotong University has been insufficient. In the future, we must urge the Municipal People's Committee to make the greatest efforts to support Jiaotong University as much as possible.

The letter said: At present, the economic and cultural foundation of the Northwest region is relatively poor, and it particularly needs the support of scientific and technological forces. Jiaotong University, on the other hand, is a comprehensive industrial university with a glorious tradition of more than 60 years in our country. Therefore, the people of Xi'an earnestly hope that Jiaotong University will move here in its entirety to support the construction of the Northwest and work with the people of the Northwest to build a socialist New Northwest.

During this meeting, fifteen professors from various universities in Xi'an made a joint statement, and twenty-five representatives from the workers, peasants, and cultural and educational circles expressed their opinions, explaining the benefits of Jiaotong University's relocation to Xi'an, and warmly expressed their feelings of welcoming Jiaotong University's relocation to Xi'an.

　　同西北人民一道建设新西北  西安人民欢迎交大迁往西安
    新华社西安23日电　出席西安市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议的全体代表，22日代表西安一百三十多万人民给交通大学全体师生员工写了一封信，欢迎他们全部迁来西安。
    这封信写道：去年，交通大学的一部分已经迁来西安，师生员工克服了不少困难，如期开学了，这对西北的工业和文化建设已经起了一定的好影响和好作用。这种支援西北建设的热情、努力克服困难的宝贵精神和行动，使我们受到极大的兴奋和鼓舞。现在特向你们表示深切的关怀、慰问和敬佩。过去一年来，我们对交大的关怀还不够。今后要督促市人民委员会，作最大努力，尽可能地对交通大学予以支持。
    信中说：目前西北地区的经济、文化基础都比较差，特别需要科学技术力量的支援。而交大在我国是已有六十多年历史、富有光荣传统的综合性工业大学。所以，西安人民殷望交通大学全部迁来，支援西北建设，和西北人民一道为建设社会主义的新西北而奋斗。
    在这次会议进行期间，有十五位来自西安各高等学校的教授代表联合发言，还有二十五位工人、农民、文教界的代表发表意见，说明交大迁来西安的好处，热诚地表示了欢迎交大迁来西安的心情。
