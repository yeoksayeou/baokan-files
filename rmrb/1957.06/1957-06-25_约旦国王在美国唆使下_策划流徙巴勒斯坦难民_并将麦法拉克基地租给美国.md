　　Jordanian King, Under US Instigation
    Plots to Displace Palestinian Refugees
    And Leases Mafraq Base to the US
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 24th: Western newspapers report that Jordanian King Hussein plans to relocate Palestinian refugees to the desert area between Jordan and Iraq. He discussed this plan with US State Department officials visiting Amman.
    Of Jordan's 1.4 million population, about one-third are Palestinian refugees, who have strong anti-imperialist sentiments and advocate unity with Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria. The King of Jordan believes that these refugees are "the greatest danger threatening Jordan's integrity." He believes that after suppressing nationalist forces in Jordan, now is a "good time" to relocate these refugees.
    The report says that Saudi Arabian troops have already deployed positions on the West Bank to prevent Arab refugees from attempting to resist when the relocation begins.
    Egypt's "Al-Gomhouria" newspaper on the 23rd accused the Jordanian King's action as a large-scale massacre of the people. "Al-Gomhouria" said that the Jordanian King's plan to sacrifice the lives and future of refugees and to erase the entire Palestinian issue in order to satisfy Western imperialism is also an act of extreme betrayal of the entire Arab nation.
    According to a Middle East News Agency report from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia issued a formal statement on June 23, denying its participation in the plan to relocate Arab refugees, and stating that it still favors the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland.
    The statement said that Saudi Arabia, like other Arab countries, still favors the return of refugees to their homeland.
    An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman also denied on June 23 the reported news that Iraq had accepted Palestinian refugees to settle in its territory.
    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Cairo on the 24th, a reporter from the Egyptian "People's Daily" reported from Damascus on the 23rd that Jordanian King Hussein and Saudi Arabian King Saud had agreed in Amman recently to lease Jordan's Mafraq Air Base to the United States.

　　约旦国王在美国唆使下
    策划流徙巴勒斯坦难民
    并将麦法拉克基地租给美国
    本报综合报道　据新华社24日讯：西方报纸消息，约旦国王侯赛因计划把巴勒斯坦难民迁移到约旦和伊拉克之间的沙漠地区，他曾经同访问安曼的美国国务院官员谈到这个计划。
    在约旦一百四十万人口中，大约有三分之一是巴勒斯坦难民，他们有强烈的反帝国主义情绪，主张同埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家团结。约旦国王认为这些难民是“威胁约旦的完整的最大危险”。他认为，在压制了约旦民族主义力量之后，目前是迁移这些难民的“良好时机”。
    消息说，沙特阿拉伯军队已经在约旦河西岸布置阵地，以防阿拉伯难民在移居开始的时候试图反抗。
    埃及“共和国报”23日指责约旦国王此举是一种大规模屠杀人民的行动。“共和国报”说，约旦国王这个牺牲难民的生命和前途、并且为了使西方帝国主义得到满足而勾消整个巴勒斯坦问题的计划，也是对整个阿拉伯民族极端背信的行为。
    另据中东通讯社吉达消息，沙特阿拉伯6月23日发表正式声明，否认它参加迁移阿拉伯难民的计划，并且表明它仍然赞成巴勒斯坦难民返回他们的故乡。
    声明说，沙特阿拉伯正像其他阿拉伯国家一样，依旧赞成难民返回他们的故乡。
    伊拉克外交部发言人6月23日也否认所报道的伊拉克接受巴勒斯坦难民在本国境内定居的消息。
    据新华社开罗24日电　埃及“人民报”记者23日从大马士革报道，约旦国王侯赛因和沙特阿拉伯国王沙特不久前在安曼会谈中已经同意把约旦的麦法拉克空军基地租给美国。
