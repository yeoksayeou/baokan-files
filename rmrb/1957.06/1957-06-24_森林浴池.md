　　I heard from a friend that lumberjacks in the old days would go up the mountain in their late teens or early twenties and wouldn't see their children again until they were in their fifties or sixties. After liberation, cadres brought their families up the mountains, and on the nights when babies were born, a dozen or twenty old men would sit on piles of wood outside the door, waiting and watching the light from the window. When the baby inside was born and cried out, the old men would return to their dormitories to sleep contentedly.
　　I didn't believe this rumor at first, but last year I went to the Sixth Logging Camp and found out it was true. At that time, among hundreds of workers and their families, there was only one three-year-old girl. The workers would crowd to her door to play with her as soon as they got off work, taking turns holding her,哄 her, giving her things to eat, and making funny faces to make her happy. The forest workers had so much enthusiasm that the child was almost crushed by the burden of friendship and affection, and became somewhat neurotic, trembling and shivering whenever workers came to her door.
　　Therefore, I believe that the forest worker comrades love children for more than just loneliness.
　　A few days ago, I moved into the small room for storing clothes between the workers' bathhouse and the elementary school classroom.
　　The workers take a bath once a week.
　　I am not an engineer, so it is difficult to explain the ingenious structure of this bathhouse clearly; in short, it is a square pool made of wood, with iron plates or something nailed to one side at the bottom, where a fire is burned to heat the water. Thirty people can come and go.
　　The water is carried from fifty meters away, bucket by bucket, and poured into the pool. About five hundred buckets are needed for each bath. The chimney for the fire runs from underground into my small room, and then straight up from beside my bed, like a cannon pointing to the sky.
　　One day and one night, the bathhouse with five hundred buckets of water was heated up. The workers came laughing and joking. They took off their clothes and "plop! plop!" jumped into the pool, using all sorts of strange and laughable words to praise the water's suitable temperature, feeling one hundred percent happy.
　　I believe that this kind of happy contagion is unstoppable, and the children who were reading in the next classroom heard the sound of the water and the sound of uncles and elders telling jokes in the water, and therefore became restless.
　　"Teacher, I need to pee!"
　　"No!"
　　"Teacher, I need to pee!"
　　"No!"
　　Then a shout was heard! A dozen or so children, all under ten years old, rushed into my room, and magically, they stripped off their clothes in an instant and ran towards the bathhouse (that's right, there was only one child who was as fat as a frog, his face flushed red, who hadn't untied the knot on his pants).
　　The workers were playing in a self-forgetful and intoxicated way, not expecting this group of people to break in. By the time they realized it, it was too late. The attack and fright they received was no less than the story of the Seven Fairies descending to earth and meeting the Cowherd in a pond, and they all screamed in unison:
　　"Hey! Hey! Little guys, little guys, get out, get out!"
　　"Hey! Hey! Teacher, teacher, where did you go! Why don't you discipline your little guys?"
　　The teacher hadn't actually gone anywhere, she was a woman, and she couldn't come over. At this moment, she was sitting next to the blackboard, angry.
　　What happened later? I heard the fairies scrubbing the backs and washing the mud off the naughty Cowherds.
　　And singing songs too!

　　森林浴池
　　黄永玉
    听朋友说，旧时代的伐木工人打年青一二十岁上山起，五六十岁再也没见过孩子。解放以后，干部们带了家属上山来了，生孩子的晚间，一二十个老头儿便坐在门外的木头堆上，对着窗户的灯光等候。屋内的孩子生下来了，呱呱大叫了，老头儿们这才满意地回宿舍去睡觉。
    对这传闻我原先不相信，去年到第六伐木场去一趟，才知道真有这样的事。那时候，几百工人和家属中，只有一个三岁大的女孩。工人们一下班就拥挤着上门来找她玩，轮流抱她，哄她，给她东西吃，做滑稽动作让她高兴。森林工人有太多的热情，孩子几乎给友谊和爱抚的担子压坏了，有些神经衰弱，一见到工人上门就发抖打战。
    因此我相信，森林工人同志们爱孩子，不光只是寂寞的问题。
    前几天，我搬到工人浴池和小学课室之间的、放衣服的小屋里住来了。
    工人们每星期洗一次澡。
    我不是工程师，很难说得清楚这个浴池的巧妙结构；总之是一个四四方方的大池，木头做的，一边底下钉着铁板什么的，下边烧火，水就热了。三十人可以来来去去。
    水从五十米远的地方挑来，一桶桶地往里倒。大约五百桶的样子才能洗上一次。烧火的烟筒从地底通到我住的小屋内，再从我的床边向上直冒，像一座朝天的大炮。
    一天一夜，五百桶水的浴池烧热了。工人们笑着闹着来了。脱光衣服，一个个“噗通！噗通！”跳进浴池，用各种奇怪而可笑的语汇来赞美着水的温度适宜，他们百分之百地感到快乐。
    我相信，这种快乐的感染是谁也阻挡不住的，正在隔壁读书的孩子听见水响，听见伯伯叔叔们在水里讲笑话，因此而坐立不安了。
    “老师，我要撒尿！”
    “不准！”
    “老师，我要撒尿！”
    “不准！”
    只听见发一声喊！十来个不上十岁的孩子冲进我的屋来，魔术似的，一下子把衣服脱得精光，朝浴池就跑（对了，只有一个胖得像青蛙似的孩子，面孔胀得通红，还没有解开裤带上的死结）。
    工人们正在忘我地、陶醉地玩着，没预料这群人马会闯进来。等到发觉时已经来不及了。他们受到的袭击和惊吓，不下于七位下凡的仙女在池溏里碰见牛郎的故事一样，都一齐尖声地叫唤起来：
    “喂！喂！小家伙，小家伙，出去出去！
    “喂！喂！老师，老师，上那儿去啦！干啥不管教你的小家伙？”
    老师其实啥地方也没去，她是女的，她过不来。此刻正坐在黑板旁边生气。
    后来呢？我听见仙女们在为淘气的牛郎们擦背洗泥了。
    还唱着歌呢！
