　　Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The Associated Press reported on the 22nd that the United States would be shipping the first batch of modern weapons—a squadron of supersonic F700 fighters and other new jet aircraft, including light bombers—into South Korea on the 24th. These aircraft will land at Osan, a U.S. Air Force base approximately thirty miles south of Seoul. United Press International said that this was "the first step taken" by the United States after unilaterally declaring the abandonment of item (m) of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

　　According to reports, in the coming period, the United States will also ship new rifles, rocket launchers, and other infantry equipment into South Korea to equip the U.S. troops invading Korea.

　　Syngman Rhee's troops will receive a regiment of new F86 Sabre jets, electronic communications equipment, and new trucks next year.

　　Following the United States' violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Syngman Rhee clique immediately took measures to create a tense situation.

　　On June 22nd, South Korean Vice Minister of National Defense Kim Jong-gap announced that the Ministry of National Defense had ordered South Korea's 700,000-strong armed forces to maintain full "alert" and had canceled all leave for military personnel.

　　According to the South Korean Hapdong News Agency, Syngman Rhee's Public Security Bureau announced on June 21st that Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, and Gangwon Province were in a state of semi-emergency. Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province are both close to the military demarcation line.

　　美新式飞机今天运进南朝鲜
    李承晚集团制造紧张局势
    本报综合报道　据新华社23日讯：美联社22日报道，美国将在24日把第一批现代化武器——一队超音速F700型战斗机和包括轻型轰炸机在内的其他新式喷气机运进南朝鲜。这些飞机将在汉城以南约三十英里的美国空军基地乌山着陆。合众社说，这是美国在片面宣布废弃朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项以后“所采取的第一个步骤”。
    据报道，在今后一个时期，美国还将运入南朝鲜新式步枪、火箭炮和其他步兵装备，以装备侵略朝鲜的美国军队。
    李承晚的军队则将在明年得到一个联队的新的F86型佩刀式喷气机、电子通讯设备和新的卡车。
    在美国破坏朝鲜停战协定之后，李承晚集团随即采取了制造紧张局势的措施。
    南朝鲜国防部次官金钟甲22日宣布，这个国防部已经命令南朝鲜的七十万人的武装部队充分保持“戒备”，并且取消了军事人员的各种休假。
    据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，李承晚的治安局6月21日宣布，汉城、京畿道和江原道处于半紧急状态。京畿道和江原道都靠近军事分界线。
