Improvements to Student Holiday Train Travel Benefits

　　(Our Newspaper) The Passenger Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, based on the opinions of students and relevant departments, has revised the preferential measures for students taking trains home during holidays, and has decided to implement them starting from June 20.

　　The main modifications and additions to this measure are as follows: (1) Students in regular academic schools without salary income (excluding graduate students), when traveling home or returning to school during winter or summer vacations, can now purchase hard-seat tickets with their student ID and a holiday train ticket discount voucher, eliminating the previous requirement of purchasing tickets with a certificate issued by the school (primary school students still require a certificate from the school). However, each student cannot enjoy more than four one-way preferential tickets in each academic year, i.e., two round trips. (2) The restriction of having to purchase round-trip tickets has been removed. Students can now purchase one-way or round-trip tickets according to their needs. (3) If part of the journey between the school and the student's home requires travel by boat or bus, and a direct train ticket cannot be purchased, a discounted train ticket for an appropriate segment can be purchased with the student ID and boat or bus ticket.

　　学生假期回家乘火车优待办法有改进
    本报讯　铁道部旅客局根据学生们和有关部门的意见，修改了学生假期回家乘坐火车减价优待办法，并决定从6月20日起开始实行。
    这项办法修改、补充的主要有以下几点：（一）凡正规学制的学校中没有薪金收入的学生（不包括研究生），在寒假或暑假期间回家或返校时，今年可凭学生证和假期火车票减价优待凭证购买硬席票，取消过去凭学校发给证明文件购票的规定（小学学生仍凭学校证明文件）。但是每个学生在每一年度内所享受的购买优待车票次数，不能超过四个单程，即两次往返。（二）取消必须购买往返客票的限制，改为由学生根据自己的需要，选购单程或往返客票。（三）如学校和学生家庭所在地间，有部分路程需要乘船或汽车，不能购买直通火车票时，可凭学生证和船票或汽车票，购买适当区间的减价优待火车票。
