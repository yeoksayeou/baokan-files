　　The Flourishing Socialist Economic System
　　Zhang Ye
    Powerful Strength of the Socialist Economy
    After World War II, socialism transcended the boundaries of the Soviet Union and became a world system. The scope of the capitalist system is shrinking, while the positions of the socialist system are constantly expanding. Before the war, the socialist system accounted for only 17% of the world's territory, about 9% of the world's population, and 7% of the world's industrial output. Now, the territories of socialist countries account for more than 25% of the world's territory, more than 35% of the population, and about 30% of the industrial output value.
    In the post-war years, due to the rapid economic growth of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the economic strength of socialism has grown. In 1956, the total output of industrial products in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries reached more than four times the pre-war level, while capitalist countries increased by only 90% during the same period. In a short period of forty years, the Soviet Union has surpassed many capitalist countries in terms of economic development and is now second only to the United States in the world in terms of industrial level. Compared with before the revolution, the Soviet Union's industrial production will increase more than thirty times by the end of this year, and will increase almost four times compared with 1940. Due to the high-speed development of the Soviet socialist economy, the electricity produced in one day and night, the pig iron produced in one and a half days, the coal produced in eight days, the oil produced in twenty days, and the sugar produced in seven days, are all equal to the annual output in 1920.
    At present, countries in the socialist camp already possess powerful productive forces. Statistics from 1955 show that the total electricity production of the Soviet Union, China, and European People's Democratic countries has increased to 263 billion kilowatt-hours, coal to 689 million tons, steel to 63 million tons, oil to 85 million tons, and cement to 44 million tons.
    In February last year, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period. Comrade Khrushchev has also pointed out in his recent speeches and talks that the Soviet Union's milk and butter production per capita will catch up with the United States by next year, and butter production may even catch up with the United States this year. Meat production will catch up with the United States during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1956-1960).
    The Soviet Union is also rapidly approaching the level of the United States in terms of the most important industrial products calculated on a per capita basis. This year, the total planned coal production of coal mining industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union's entire union and affiliated republics will be 446.22 million tons. Local coal mining industrial enterprises will also produce a large amount of coal. The United States' coal production this year will decrease to 454 million tons. This means that the Soviet Union's coal production this year will catch up with or even surpass the United States. The Soviet Union's cement production will also catch up with and surpass the United States by 1965.
　　The Superiority of the Socialist Economic System
    The socialist economic system is the most superior economic system. In the forty years of its existence, whether in harsh war environments or under conditions of peaceful economic competition, it has shown unparalleled superiority over capitalism.
    The superiority of the socialist economic system is first manifested in the fact that the growth rate of industrial production in socialist countries greatly exceeds that of capitalist countries. During the period of 1930-1955, that is, in the twenty-six years, the average annual growth rate of industrial output in several major countries was: 12.3% for the Soviet Union, 3.3% for the United States, 2.4% for the United Kingdom, and 0.9% for France. If we remove the period of World War II and only compare the industrial production growth rates of the eleven years before the war and the nine years after the war, the situation becomes even clearer. The average growth rate of industrial production in these twenty years was 18% for the Soviet Union, 2.8% for the United States, 3.5% for the United Kingdom, and 2.5% for France. This means that the growth rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union is five to seven times or more than seven times the rate of several advanced capitalist countries.
    The speed of industrial production in other socialist countries is also faster than in some capitalist countries. Here, only China, Czechoslovakia, and Albania are taken as examples. The average growth rate of industrial production in my country's first Five-Year Plan was 14.7%, and the growth rate of industrial production in 1956 reached 25%. Czechoslovakia's total industrial output in 1956 reached 2.7 times the pre-war level of 1937. According to current estimates, Czechoslovakia's industrial production level can roughly catch up with or surpass the most developed capitalist countries around 1970. When Albania completed its first Five-Year Plan in 1955, its total industrial output increased to 10.5 times the pre-war level of 1938.
    The superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system is also manifested in the continuous improvement of labor productivity. The growth rate of labor productivity in socialist countries also exceeds that of capitalist countries. For example, the labor productivity of Soviet industry in 1955 was almost twice the pre-war level, and increased eight times compared with the 1913 level. In the past forty years, the average annual growth of labor productivity in the Soviet Union has exceeded the United States by about 1.5 times, the United Kingdom by 2.6 times, and France by 5 times.
    Under the socialist system, there are favorable conditions for the high development of science and technology. Under the capitalist system, technological development is extremely unbalanced, and the private ownership of the means of production and the anarchy of production restrict technological development.
    Socialist countries have made amazing progress in science and technology, especially in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. Three years ago, the Soviet Union built the world's first industrial atomic power plant, and now it is starting to build a giant atomic power plant. The heavy water atomic reactor and cyclotron built with the help of the Soviet Union in our country are about to be completed, and the high-pressure electrostatic accelerator installed by our country itself is also about to be completed. The German Democratic Republic plans to build twenty atomic power plants by 1970.
    The training of scientific and technological talents is also far superior to capitalism. The Soviet Union trains almost three times as many engineers each year as the United States. At present, the Soviet Union has thirty to forty times more technical personnel than the United States.
    Economic cooperation is carried out among socialist countries. This fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation relationship can not only promote the economic development of each socialist country, but also is conducive to the economic upsurge of the entire socialist system.
　　Who Will Win the Peaceful Economic Competition
    Under the current conditions of peaceful competition between the two economic systems, socialism has shown unparalleled superiority over capitalism. The task put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period is the common goal of struggle for all countries in the socialist system. Due to the different degrees of production development in various socialist countries, in terms of per capita output, industrially developed countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic have all the conditions to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the shortest historical period. Other socialist countries, due to the people's efforts to develop the socialist economy and mutual assistance and cooperation in economic and scientific technology, will also achieve this task after a considerable period of time. Of course, in the cause of building socialism and communism, difficulties are inevitable, and shortcomings are unavoidable. However, we have sufficient conditions to overcome any difficulties and any shortcomings on the road ahead. The future of the socialist economic system is bright and splendid, and it will definitely be able to finally defeat capitalism in the economic competition.
    The development direction of the capitalist economic system is completely opposite. In the post-war period, the production of some capitalist countries has increased to some extent, especially the United States, where industrial production has been rising from August 1954 to the end of 1955. The industrial production of West Germany, France, and Japan has also developed. But it should be seen that this rise and development are caused by the following basic factors: foreign economic expansion; renewal of fixed capital; economic militarization and arms expansion; expansion of credit; greatly strengthening the exploitation of the working class and reducing the living standards of the working people. Therefore, this rise and development are unstable and unhealthy. Coupled with the corruption of the capitalist system itself and its insurmountable contradiction between private ownership and the social nature of production, the contradiction between production and consumption, inflation and rising prices, the increasing upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries, etc., the internal contradictions and competition of the capitalist economic system are bound to intensify, new economic crises and shocks will increasingly mature, and its future will inevitably be defeated by the socialist economic system in the peaceful economic competition. The capitalist economic system will inevitably suffer the fate of its demise.

　　蓬勃发展的社会主义经济体系
　　章叶
    强大的社会主义经济威力
    第二次世界大战以后，社会主义已经越出苏联一个国家的范围，而变成了一个世界体系。资本主义体系的范围日益缩小，社会主义体系的阵地不断扩大。战前，社会主义体系只占世界领土的17％，约占世界人口的9％，占世界工业产量的7％。而现在，社会主义阵营各国的领土已占世界领土的25％以上，人口的35％以上，工业产值的30％左右了。
    在战后年代中，由于苏联和其他社会主义国家经济的迅速增长，社会主义的经济实力日益壮大。1956年，苏联和其他社会主义国家的工业品总产量达到战前水平的四倍以上，而资本主义各国在同期仅增加了90％。在短短的四十年期间，苏联在经济发展方面超过了许多资本主义国家，现在在工业水平上仅次于美国而居于世界第二位。与革命前相比，苏联的工业生产量到今年底将要增到三十多倍，而同1940年相比差不多将增加四倍。由于苏联社会主义经济的高速度发展，现在一昼夜生产的电力，一点五昼夜生产的生铁，八昼夜生产的煤，二十昼夜生产的石油以及七昼夜生产的糖，都等于1920年的全年产量。
    目前，社会主义阵营国家已经拥有强大的生产力。1955年的统计数字表明：苏联、中国和欧洲各人民民主国家的电力生产总量已经增加到两千六百三十亿度，煤增加到六亿八千九百万吨，钢增加到六千三百万吨，石油增加到八千五百万吨，水泥增加到四千四百万吨。
    去年2月，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会提出了要在最短的历史时期内，使苏联在按人口计算的产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务。赫鲁晓夫同志在最近的演说和谈话中也曾经指出，按人口平均计算，苏联的奶类和油脂产量到明年就能赶上美国，而油脂产量甚至在今年就可能赶上美国，肉类产量要在第六个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）赶上美国。
    在按人口平均计算的最重要工业产品方面，苏联也在迅速接近美国的水平。今年全年，苏联全联盟和加盟共和国的采煤工业企业计划总共将开采四亿四千六百二十万吨煤。各地方采煤工业企业还将生产大量的煤。而美国在今年的煤产量将减少到四亿五千四百万吨。这就是说，今年苏联的煤产量将赶上甚至超过美国。苏联的水泥产量也将在1965年以前赶上和超过美国。
　　社会主义经济制度的优越性
    社会主义经济制度是最优越的一种经济制度。在它存在的四十年期间，不论是在严酷的战争环境中，还是在和平的经济竞赛条件下，都表明了比资本主义具有无比的优越性。
    社会主义经济体系的优越性，首先表现在社会主义国家工业生产增长的速度大大超过了资本主义国家。在1930—1955年期间，也就是在二十六年期间，几个主要国家的工业产量平均每年增长的速度是：苏联为12.3％，美国为3.3％，英国为2.4％，法国为0.9％。如果去掉第二次世界大战期间，而只拿战前十一年和战后九年的工业生产增长速度来比较，情况就更明显了。这二十年中工业生产的平均增长速度苏联为18％，美国为2.8％，英国为3.5％，法国为2.5％。这就是说，苏联工业生产增长速度为几个先进的资本主义国家速度的五倍到七倍或七倍以上。
    其他社会主义国家工业生产的速度也比一些资本主义国家为快，这里只举中国、捷克斯洛伐克和阿尔巴尼亚三国为例。我国第一个五年计划工业生产平均增长速度是14.7％，而1956年工业生产增长速度竟达25％。捷克斯洛伐克1956年的工业总产量达到战前1937年水平的二点七倍。据目前估计，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产水平大致在1970年时就可以赶上或超过最发达的资本主义国家。阿尔巴尼亚在1955年完成第一个五年计划时，工业总产量增加为战前1938年水平的十点五倍。
    社会主义经济制度优于资本主义经济制度也表现在劳动生产率的不断提高上。社会主义国家劳动生产率增长的速度，也超过了资本主义国家。例如，苏联工业的劳动生产率在1955年几乎达到战前水平的两倍，与1913年水平相比提高到八倍。四十年来，苏联劳动生产率的增长每年平均超过美国约一点五倍，超过英国二点六倍，超过法国五倍。
    在社会主义制度下，科学技术有高度发展的有利条件。在资本主义制度下，技术发展是极端的不平衡，生产资料的私有制和生产的无政府状态束缚了技术的发展。
    社会主义国家科学技术有惊人的进步，特别表现在和平利用原子能方面。三年前苏联就建立了世界上第一座工业原子能发电站，现在又开始建设一座巨型原子能发电站。我国在苏联帮助下建立的重水型原子反应堆和回旋加速器将要建成，我国自己装置的高气压静电加速器也即将完成。德意志民主共和国计划到1970年将建造起二十座原子能发电站。
    在科学技术人才的培养方面也大大优于资本主义。苏联每年培养出的工程师差不多要比美国多三倍。目前苏联的技术人员要比美国多三十到四十倍。
    社会主义各国间进行着经济合作，这种兄弟般的互助合作关系，不但能促进每一个社会主义国家的经济发展，而且也有利于整个社会主义体系的经济高涨。
　　谁将在和平经济竞赛中获胜
    在目前两种经济制度和平竞赛的条件下，社会主义已经表明了比资本主义无比的优越性。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所提出的要在最短的历史时期内，按人口平均计算的产量赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务，是社会主义体系各国共同奋斗的目标。由于各社会主义国家生产发展的程度不同，在按人口平均计算的产量方面，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国这样一些工业发达的国家，有一切条件在最短的历史时期内赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。其他社会主义国家，由于人民努力发展社会主义经济，并且在经济和科学技术方面彼此互助合作，经过相当的时间，也一定会实现这个任务。当然，在建设社会主义和共产主义的事业中，困难是一定会有的，缺点也是免不了的。但是，我们具有充分的条件，来克服前进途中的任何困难和任何缺点。社会主义经济体系的前景是光辉灿烂的，它一定能够在经济竞赛中最后战胜资本主义。
    资本主义经济体系的发展方向则完全相反。战后时期，某些资本主义国家的生产虽有某些增长，特别是美国从1954年8月到1955年年底工业生产一直是上升的，西德、法国和日本的工业生产也有了发展。但是应当看到，这种上升和发展是由下列基本因素造成的：对外经济扩张；固定资本的更新；经济军事化和军备扩张；信贷的扩大；大大加强对工人阶级的剥削和降低劳动人民的生活水平。因此，这种上升和发展是不稳固和不健康的。加上资本主义制度本身的腐朽和它的不可克服的私人占有制同生产社会性的矛盾，生产和消费的矛盾，通货膨胀和物价上涨，殖民地附属国人民反殖民主义斗争的日益高涨等等，使资本主义经济体系的内部矛盾和竞争必然要更加加剧，新的经济危机和震荡会日益成熟，其前景必然要在和平经济竞赛中被社会主义经济体系所战胜。资本主义经济制度最后不可避免地要遭到它灭亡的命运。
