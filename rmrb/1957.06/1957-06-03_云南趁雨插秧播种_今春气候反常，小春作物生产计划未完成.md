Kunming, June 2nd (Reported by our newspaper) – Rural areas in Yunnan are engaging in an intense battle to persistently strive for a bumper agricultural harvest.

Since the beginning of spring this year, the climate has been abnormal, suffering continuous damage from frost, snow, and drought, resulting in the failure to complete the originally planned spring crop production. Broad beans, in particular, have experienced reduced yields. However, due to the active expansion of spring planting areas last winter and the significant increase in wheat and tuber yields, the total output of spring grains and oil crops is still higher than last year. Currently, it is the busy season for transplanting seedlings and sowing seeds for major spring crops. As a result of continuous water conservancy construction in recent years, the current water storage in various regions can still guarantee that 50% of the fields have water for transplanting seedlings even in the event of continued drought. At the same time, the masses in various regions are doing everything possible to fight the drought through measures such as conserving water, "three-point dry sowing," and carrying water for spot planting. Therefore, about five million mu of rice have already been transplanted, which is still equivalent to the progress made during normal years.

This year, various regions have also paid special attention to expanding land utilization according to local conditions, emphasizing the use of idle and wasteland, field edges, and implementing reasonable intercropping, etc., according to farmers' habits, in order to increase the production of various beans, small oil crops, and miscellaneous grains. Most counties now emphasize this type of diversified operation to make up for the unfulfilled tasks of spring crops.

From May 27th, the entire province of Yunnan has experienced widespread rainfall of 20 to 70 millimeters for several consecutive days. People in various regions are seizing the season to plant and carry out remedial work on drought-stricken crops that generally suffer from lack of seedlings and gaps in the fields.

The enlarged meeting of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, held from May 23rd to 30th, required Party committees at all levels and rural branches to make two preparations: if the rain comes in time, they should plant on time according to the original plan; if the drought continues, they should switch to planting other drought-resistant crops. It is necessary to prevent both complacency and slackening tendencies, as well as impatience and tendencies to become detached from reality and the masses, and to steadfastly persist in the decisive battle to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

### 云南趁雨插秧播种  今春气候反常，小春作物生产计划未完成

    云南趁雨插秧播种
    今春气候反常，小春作物生产计划未完成
    本报昆明2日电　云南各地农村正在为坚持不懈地争取实现农业大丰收投入紧张的战斗。
    今年入春以来，气候反常，连续受到霜雪、干旱的侵害，以致今年小春作物未能完成原订生产计划，其中特别是蚕豆减产。但由于去冬各地积极扩大了小春播种面积，而且小麦和薯类产量显著增加，所以小春粮食和油料作物的总产量仍比去年有所增加。目前已经进入紧张的大春作物栽秧播种季节，由于连年进行水利基本建设的结果，各地现在的蓄水仍可保证在继续干旱的情况下有50％的田有水栽秧。同时各地群众正在从节约用水、“三干点播”、挑水点种等方面，想尽一切办法和干旱作斗争。因此，目前已有五百万亩左右的水稻栽插下去，仍旧相当于历年正常年景时的进度。
    各地今年还特别注意了因地制宜扩大土地利用率，根据农民习惯，重视利用闲地废地、田边地角及实行合理间作工作等，以增加各种豆类、各种小油料和各种小杂粮的生产。现在大多数县都重视这类多种经营，以补足小春作物未完成的任务。
    从5月27日起，连日来云南全省普遍下雨二十公厘至七十公厘，各地群众正在抓紧季节栽种和进行对过去一般旱地作物干旱缺苗缺塘的补救工作。
    5月23日至30日召开的中共云南省委扩大会议，要求各级党委、各地农村支部，做好两套准备，雨水及时来就及时按原计划栽种，旱象继续时，就改种其他干旱作物。既要防止麻痹和松劲的倾向，也要防止急躁和产生脱离实际脱离群众的倾向，踏踏实实地把争取今年大丰收的决定性战斗坚持下去。
