Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 24th: At the enlarged meeting of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the grassroots cadre meeting held from the 20th to the 22nd, many League members exposed numerous facts about Shu Jun, the Director of the Organization Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Li Kang, the Director of the Propaganda Department (both of whom are alternate members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League), actively supporting right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

Participants in the meeting pointed out in their speeches that Shu Jun and Li Kang, taking the opportunity of conveying the spirit of the National Work Conference of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, secretly peddled a large number of private agendas of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Li Longshu, Director of the Plant Protection Department of the Southwest Agricultural College, exposed the ten noteworthy "instructions" on how to deal with the contending and blooming policy conveyed by Shu Jun and Li Kang. The most vicious of these ten "instructions" were the following: ⒈ "League members should boldly speak out and take the lead in contending, setting fires everywhere. With the spirit of standing at the forefront of political movements in the past, they should be determined to be initiators and have the spirit of people with lofty ideals"; ⒉ The China Democratic League organization should work on removing labels, and when seeing someone wearing a label that does not fit, it should help them take it off; ⒊ "The China Democratic League organization should work on extrication. When seeing someone surrounded and unable to get out, it should send reinforcements"; ⒋ "The China Democratic League organization should work on political insurance. As long as this person is not a genuine counter-revolutionary, they should be politically protected." Before giving these ten "instructions," Shu Jun and Li Kang also made an "assessment" of the "current situation." Li Longshu quoted Shu Jun as saying during the transmission: "The current problems of the Chinese Communist Party are: those with an authoritative mindset are afraid of collapse, dogmatists have no ability and can only strike three blows, opportunists cannot stand firm, kind-hearted defenders of the old order are afraid of chaos, and lazy people are unwilling to do ideological work, they all have concerns." The meaning of these words is that the current moment is an excellent opportunity for the China Democratic League.

Hu Ruoshui, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, confirmed the facts exposed by Li Longshu in his speech. He said that no one saw any documents when Shu and Li returned from the meeting this time. The outline for the transmission was discussed by the two of them on the boat, and even the Chairman of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League had not seen it; much of the content of the so-called ten "instructions" was very vicious and was not found in the national work conference resolutions that were later seen. He asked: Did Shu Jun and Li Kang smuggle in the private agendas of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji? What exactly did the Central Committee decide at this meeting, and why are we not fully informed?

Lin Chengyi, Director of General Affairs of Chongqing University, questioned: Where did the ten "instructions" come from? Whose program is it? Shu Jun once said that when discussing Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference at the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League, he could not find a direction, but after listening to the speeches of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, he found the pulse and thought there was something to be gained. What does this mean? Shu Jun said during the transmission that there were many things that could not be transmitted and would be discussed at small meetings, and that he also brought back a lot of inside news this time. Why is he not explaining it?

Fang Jing, Dean of Studies of Southwest Normal College, and lecturer Li Linzheng, said that Shu Jun and Li Kang incited setting fires everywhere during the blooming and contending process and provided "insurance" and "extrication" for right-wing elements everywhere. At the beginning of the blooming and contending, Li Kang and Shu Jun proposed to thoroughly set fires, and that if problems arose, the China Democratic League organization would back them up. This created a misconception among League members that this was a struggle against the Communist Party. Jin Xiru, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and Dean of Studies of Chongqing University, said: Once, Shu Jun forced the three chairmen to speak out to the United Front Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Deputy Mayor, and the Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. We said that we did not have much to say, but Shu Jun was unhappy and said that the three of us were "leftist" leaders. Jin Xiru said that Shu Jun came to Chongqing University and had a fierce argument with him about the issue of schools not needing Party committees. Shu said: The Party committees of various schools are doing a "terrible" job, making the schools look like a mess; the Party committees should withdraw from the schools. When Jin Xiru said that the Party committee of Chongqing University was very good, Shu Jun said that Chongqing University was the "only exception." Geng Zhenhua, an associate professor at Southwest Normal College, said that when he reported the rampant activities of right-wing elements to Li Kang and proposed to refute them, Li Kang instead said: "What is this? This is a natural phenomenon," indicating a lack of interest in refutation. Hu Ruoshui said that when he saw the People's Daily editorial "Why is this happening?" Li Kang said to him: "As soon as I saw this layout, I knew the situation was not good." Li Linzheng said: On June 21st, Shu Jun also said to Li Dixuan that in the current fight against right-wing elements, do not beat them to death with one blow, but beat them alive with one blow, and said not to tell others about this. Lei Hengshun, a young lecturer at Chongqing University, said: When Chongqing University started to bloom and contend, Shu Jun actively "backed" us, but after the People's Daily editorial was published, Shu Jun rushed to my house and told me: Based on his own experience, do not be a leader, because the one who suffers in the end is yourself.

　　恶毒的“指示”
　　重庆民盟揭露舒军、李康推销章伯钧、罗隆基的私货
    据新华社重庆24日电  在20日到22日举行的民盟重庆市委扩大会议和基层干部会议上，许多盟员揭发了民盟重庆市委的当权实力人物——组织部长舒军和宣传部长李康（他们都是民盟中央候补委员），积极支持章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子的许多事实。
    参加会议的人在发言中指出，舒军和李康借着传达民盟中央全国工作会议的机会，偷偷贩卖了章伯钧、罗隆基的大批私货。西南农学院植物保护系主任李隆术揭露了舒军、李康传达的对付争鸣方针的十点值得注意的“指示”。这十点“指示”中最恶毒的有以下几点：⒈“盟员要大胆的鸣，带头的争，要到处点火，以过去站在政治运动前列的精神，决心作一个抛砖引玉的人，要有仁人志士的精神”；⒉民盟组织要做摘帽子的工作，看见有人被戴了一顶不合头寸的帽子，要帮助他摘下来；⒊“民盟组织要作解围工作，看见有人被包围了，出不来，要发救兵”；⒋“民盟组织要作政治保险工作，只要这人不是真正的反革命分子，在政治上要保护他”。在作这十点“指示”以前，舒军、李康还对“目前情况”作了“估计”。李隆术引用舒军传达时的话说：“目前中共的问题是：有权威思想的怕垮台，教条主义者没有本领，只能打三板斧，不能打持久战，机会主义者站不住脚，好心肠的卫道者怕天下大乱，懒汉不肯作思想工作，他们都有顾虑。”这些话的意思是说，目前是民盟的绝好时机。
    民盟重庆市委组织部副部长胡若水的发言证实了李隆术所揭发的事实。他说，这次舒、李二人参加会议回来时什么文件谁也没有看见。传达的提纲是两人在船上就商量好了的，甚至连民盟市委主任委员也没有看过；所谓十点“指示”不少内容十分恶毒，是后来所看到的全国工作会议决议上所没有的。他问：舒军、李康是否把章伯钧、罗隆基的私货挟带进来了？盟中央这次会议究竟决定些什么东西，为什么不让我们完全知道。
    重庆大学总务长林诚毅提出质问说：十点“指示”究竟是那里来的？是谁的纲领？舒军曾说，在民盟全国工作会议上讨论毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话时，找不到方向，听了章伯钧、罗隆基的发言后就摸到了脉搏，这下有搞头了，请问这是什么意思？舒军在传达时说还有很多东西不能传达，要开小型会议来讲，又说这次还带回不少内幕新闻，为什么不交代出来。
    西南师范学院教务长方敬、讲师李麟征等说，舒军、李康在鸣放中煽动到处点火，并到处为右派分子“保险”、“解围”。鸣放一开始，李康、舒军曾提出要作到彻底放火，放出了问题有民盟组织撑腰，这在盟员中造成一种错觉，感觉这次是同共产党对立，搞一个斗争。民盟重庆市委副主委、重庆大学教务长金锡如说：有一次，舒军逼着我们三位主委要向中共重庆市委统战部、副市长、中共重庆市委书记等放，我们说，没有多少东西可放，舒军却不高兴地说我们三位是“左”派领导人。金锡如说，舒军到重大来和他激烈争论学校不要党委的问题，舒说：各个学校的党委都搞得很“糟”，把学校弄得不像样；党委应退出学校。当金锡如说重庆大学的党委就很好时，舒军就说重大是“唯一的例外”。西南师范学院副教授耿振华说，当他向李康汇报右派分子的猖狂活动，提出要反驳时，李康反而说：“这算什么，这是必然现象”，表示对反驳不感兴趣。胡若水说，当看到人民日报社论“这是为什么”时，李康对他说：“我一看这一布局，就知道情况不佳了。”李麟征说：在6月21日舒军还向黎涤玄说，现在打右派分子，不要一棍子打死，而要一棍子打活，并说这话不要告诉别人。重大青年讲师雷亨顺说：当重大开始鸣放时，舒军是积极为我们“撑腰”的，但人民日报社论发表后，舒军急忙到我家来告诉我说：根据他自己的经验，不要强出头，结果吃亏的还是自己。
