　　The Increased Production and Thrift Movement Promotes Production
    New Atmosphere in Vietnamese Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 25th: The Vietnamese industrial and mining enterprises, through the widespread rectification of labor discipline and inspection of wasteful practices in the Increased Production and Thrift Movement, have seen a new atmosphere in the second quarter of production. Since the beginning of summer, influenza has been prevalent in factories and enterprises in northern Vietnam, with many workers falling ill. However, many enterprises, including the Hanoi Power Plant and the Haiphong Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, still overfulfilled their production plans for May and the first half of June. The Nam Dinh Textile Factory, where the flu was rampant, also completed more than 90% of its production plan.
    Workers at the Thuy Khe Tannery have continuously improved their technology in the course of the Increased Production and Thrift Movement, increasing productivity from 400 hides per day in the past to the current 1,160 hides. After in-depth inspections at the Unification Match Factory, where waste was serious and labor discipline was lax, the productivity of the matchstick cutting department increased by more than two times, and the productivity of the sawmill, matchstick sorting machine, and matchstick sifting machine also increased by 11% to 26%, while also improving the quality of the matches. In addition to increasing productivity, workers at the Lam Son Paper Mill have also saved a large amount of raw materials and fuel. In May alone, they saved raw materials and fuel equivalent to 1.37 million Vietnamese Dong.

　　增产节约运动推动了生产
    越南工矿企业出现新气象
    新华社河内25日电  越南各工矿企业在增产节约运动中普遍整顿了劳动纪律和检查了浪费现象，从而在第二季度的生产中出现了新的气象。入夏以来，流行性感冒曾经在越南北方各工厂、企业中流行，工人生病的很多。但是，包括河内发电厂、海防磷肥厂在内的许多企业仍旧超额完成了5月份和6月上半月的生产计划。流行性感冒闹得很猖獗的南定纺织厂也完成生产计划的90％以上。
    瑞溪制革厂工人在开展增产节约运动中不断改进技术，使生产率从过去的每天制四百张皮革增加到目前的一千一百六十张。浪费现象较严重和劳动纪律较松弛的统一火柴厂经过深入检查以后，梗枝（切火柴梗）部的生产率增加了两倍多，锯木机、选梗机、筛梗机等部分的生产率也提高了11％到26％，同时还提高了火柴的质量。蓝山造纸厂工人除提高了生产率以外，还节约了大批原料和燃料。仅在5月份就节约了相当于一百三十七万元越币的原料和燃料。
