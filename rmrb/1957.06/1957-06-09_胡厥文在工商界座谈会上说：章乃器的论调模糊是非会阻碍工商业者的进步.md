At this symposium, everyone spoke their minds freely, revealing many shortcomings and offering various suggestions to the Party. A Party that leads the people of the whole country, has achieved two great revolutionary victories and unprecedented achievements in economic construction, can listen to the people's opinions with such an open mind, and is happy to accept all kinds of very sharp criticisms. This is only possible in a socialist country led by the working class, and it also fully demonstrates the Chinese Communist Party's selflessness and noble spirit of everything for the people. I believe that the Party's policies and guidelines in recent years have been wise and correct, but at the same time, since our country is a large country with 600 million people, the situation is very complicated, all kinds of work are new, and everyone lacks experience, so errors and shortcomings are inevitable in the implementation process. In order for the Party to better lead the people of the whole country in socialist construction, we have a responsibility to expose the shortcomings and errors in the Party's policies and work, so that the Party can correct these shortcomings and errors and further strengthen its leadership. We personally experienced the oppression of the three major enemies and the miserable life of poverty and backwardness in the old China. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the face of the old China has been completely changed in just a few years, and its international status has been greatly improved. Every patriotic and conscientious industrialist and businessman loves and is grateful to the Chinese Communist Party. The exposure of many shortcomings and errors in this symposium has not only not made us doubt the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, but has also increased our confidence. We believe that the Party will be able to distinguish right from wrong, correct mistakes, and better lead the people of the whole country to move forward.

Helping the Party Eliminate the "Three Evils" is to Further Strengthen the Party's Leadership

The problems that everyone exposed in this symposium, some are individual, and many are more common. The most common are: First, the progress of industrialists and businessmen after the overall public-private partnership is underestimated, and often industrialists and businessmen today are still seen as capitalists before the "Five-Anti" campaign. Many Party members and workers are not clear about the essence of the united front policy, and some even lack common sense about which democratic parties and what organizations the Democratic National Construction Association is. Second, although there are many good public-private and Party-masses relations, abnormal ones are also common. The private side often has positions and responsibilities but no power in the enterprise, and its enthusiasm cannot be brought into play. Public-private and Party-masses relations are of course a matter for both sides, and some problems are the responsibility of the private side. However, many public side members do not see the enthusiasm of the private side, and do not fully appreciate the state's policy of reforming industrialists and businessmen, one-sidedly or even wrongly emphasizing class relations and treating the private side as outsiders. Many public side members are laymen in business and do not respect the opinions of the private side, resulting in considerable losses to the country in tangible and intangible ways. Third, inappropriate personnel arrangements, many private technical personnel are treated with idleness, and have no place to use their skills. Fourth, some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen still have difficulties in their lives, and problems that can be solved at present are not solved. These problems can be said to exist to varying degrees in various places.

The state regards us industrialists and businessmen as a wealth, and most of us industrialists and businessmen are indeed willing to contribute everything we can to the country's socialist construction. However, due to the existence of the above-mentioned problems, the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen is often dampened, creating a distance between the public and private sectors and between the Party and the masses. If these problems are not resolved, the "walls" and "ditches" pointed out by everyone cannot be removed and filled.

However, we must not doubt the socialist system itself or the leadership of the Party because of the existence of these problems. If we do not pay attention to the many problems that exist now and do not give them timely solutions, the consequences of development will be serious; at the same time, if we wrongly regard these problems as the faults of the socialist system, or deny the correctness of the Party's leadership because of this, it is even more wrong. I believe that most of the problems revealed by everyone are manifestations of dogmatism, bureaucracy and sectarianism. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao see more comprehensively and thoroughly than any of us, so they launched this nationwide large-scale rectification movement. We industrialists and businessmen "speak out freely" to expose various problems and help the Party to rectify its work, in order to make the Party's ranks more pure and the Party's prestige higher, so that it can better lead socialist construction.

Some people equate the shortcomings of certain Party members with the leadership of the Party, confuse the bourgeoisie and the working class, and confuse the socialist revolution and bourgeois reformism. On these principled issues, we must distinguish right from wrong.

In this "great blooming and contending," many of us industrialists and businessmen have made sharp criticisms of the Party and put forward various opinions, which are all expressions of love and trust for the Party. We must not doubt this at all. However, we must not think that all opinions in the "contention" are correct, and the Party should accept them all. I believe that "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is the Party's correct policy for handling and resolving contradictions among the people. In order to solve contradictions well through "blooming and contending" and further unite the people of the whole country, we must distinguish right from wrong, distinguish which are right and which are wrong, affirm the right ones, and explain and criticize the wrong ones.

In this "contention," some comrades' views are worth considering. According to my experience, there are several prominent issues in this "contention" that must be paid attention to and distinguished between right and wrong: First, some people equate certain shortcomings in the Party's work and certain shortcomings of Party members with the Party's leadership itself, thereby doubting whether the Party's leadership is necessary. This tendency exists when discussing whether public representatives should withdraw from enterprises and whether Party cadres should withdraw from democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Second, some people confuse the bourgeoisie and the working class under the cover of various terms, thereby denying the revolutionary nature and leading role of the working class. This is reflected in the debate on learning from the working class, and also in the current debate on class relations and two-sidedness. Some people believe that the bourgeoisie and the working class are different as classes, and industrialists and businessmen and workers are no different. This statement, which completely separates specific people from abstract classes, essentially denies the difference between the two classes. Third, some people misunderstand and distort the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, equating our country's socialist revolution with capitalist reformism. This is reflected in the debate on the redemption policy and fixed interest, and also in the debate on whether industrialists and businessmen still have two sides now and whether they still need to be transformed. For these principled issues, we must distinguish right from wrong, and we cannot think that we are attacking "blooming and contending" just because others put forward different opinions.

Zhang Naiqi's argument not only blurs right and wrong, but also hinders the progress of industrialists and businessmen.

I cannot agree with many of the arguments in Comrade Zhang Naiqi's recent articles and speeches published in the newspapers. He said that "complete transformation" increases the endless worries of industrialists and businessmen, that bureaucracy is more terrible than capitalism, and that fixed interest is not exploitation but "unearned income," etc. Not only do I disagree, but I believe that most of our industrialists and businessmen who are rapidly advancing on the road to socialism cannot accept it. Just taking the phrase "complete transformation" as an analysis, in our society, this is a word of praise and commendation. For example, a child in someone's family has always not studied hard and his behavior is not disciplined, which makes relatives and friends feel sad. Now that he has changed for the better, relatives and friends say with joy: "You have made progress, completely changed, and have been completely transformed." This is a word of praise. Today, we capitalists are transforming ourselves into self-reliant laborers, how can we not say that we have been completely transformed? This is the most appropriate sentence, and it is also a good sentence, how can it cause endless worries? Also, like capitalism and bureaucracy, the former is a system of exploitation, and the latter is a bad work style. How can these two different things be compared? There is bureaucracy in socialist society, doesn't capitalist society also have bureaucracy? Isn't the bureaucracy in socialist society left over from capitalist society? Can capitalist society expose and criticize bureaucracy like socialist society? This truth is very obvious. Also, like fixed interest, of course it is exploitation, why bother to give it another name of "unearned income." Does it mean that if we say that fixed interest is exploitation, we capitalists cannot hold our heads up, and if we say that fixed interest is unearned income, we can feel at ease? Some industrialists and businessmen may suddenly feel that this kind of argument is very close to my heart, but after thinking deeply, they will find that this kind of argument is not good for our transformation and progress. The more and more progress we make in the industrial and commercial circles, the more people will disagree with this kind of argument. I believe that the country treats us as wealth, this is a real word, and it is also a word of encouragement. As for ourselves, especially the backbone members and representatives, we should lead the industrialists and businessmen to contribute their talents with all their strength, and at the same time ask ourselves, and constantly check our mistakes and shortcomings. In daily social life, if you do a good thing, people say that you are amazing, it is encouragement, but you should not be arrogant and think that you are amazing, you must know that modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind. I think that the greatest harm of Comrade Naiqi's argument is that it not only blurs right and wrong, but also hinders the progress of our industrialists and businessmen. What we want is a candid friend, what we want is good medicine. Today, the Communist Party is so correct and great, and it still wants to rectify its work and ask to hear unpleasant words. Shouldn't industrialists and businessmen who are in the process of transformation and seeking progress listen to some unpleasant words to improve themselves?

I believe that our industrial and commercial circles should progress, transform, and contribute to socialism. Our Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce must unite under this goal, distinguish right from wrong, and improve our work.

Socialism is the ideological foundation of "contention."

"Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is ideologically the struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. The bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism that exist in some Party members are the dust of bourgeois ideology that has been infected by the proletariat. Socialism is the ideological foundation of our "contention," and the purpose of the contention is to improve our socialist ideological understanding. Capitalist ideology cannot help the Party eliminate the "three evils," and it is even more impossible to ask the Party to lead the people of the whole country to change and take the road of socialism according to capitalist principles.

I fully believe that the Party is fully determined to correct the shortcomings in its work and eliminate the "three evils." Through this rectification, the Party's leadership will surely become stronger, the "three evils" existing in some Party members will be continuously eliminated, the Party's prestige will be further enhanced, and the people of the whole country will be more closely united around the Party.

Through this rectification, the public-private and Party-masses relations will gradually become normal, and all the factors that hindered our enthusiasm in the past will be gradually eliminated. Under the leadership of the Party, we will have a better working environment and working conditions than now, so that we can all bring our expertise into play.

Now is the time when the first Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled and the second Five-Year Plan will be successfully started; for us industrialists and businessmen, it is the time to strengthen self-transformation and transform ourselves into real laborers as soon as possible. Whether for the construction of the country or for our own transformation, we should unite with the public and workers in the enterprise to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy and engage in socialist competition. This is the most important task of our country today. We industrialists and businessmen have rich business experience, and many people have modern technology. If we can actively contribute our talents, I believe that we can definitely contribute to increasing production and practicing economy, which will not only benefit the country's socialist cause, but also help our self-transformation.

### 胡厥文在工商界座谈会上说：章乃器的论调模糊是非会阻碍工商业者的进步

    胡厥文在工商界座谈会上说：
    章乃器的论调模糊是非会阻碍工商业者的进步
    在这次座谈会上，大家本知无不言，言无不尽的精神，揭露了不少缺点，对党提出了各种建议。一个领导全国人民，取得了两次伟大的革命胜利和经济建设空前成就的党，能够这样虚怀若谷地倾听人民的意见，乐于接受各种非常尖锐的批评，这只有在工人阶级领导的社会主义国家才有可能，同时也充分表明了中国共产党的大公无私，一切为人民的崇高精神。我认为，几年来党的政策方针是英明的是正确的，但同时由于我国是六亿人口的大国，情况非常复杂，各种工作都是新的，大家还缺乏经验，以致在执行过程中不可避免地会有错误和缺点。我们为了党能够更好地领导全国人民进行社会主义建设，大家有责任把党在政策和工作中的缺点和错误揭露出来，使得党能够改正这些缺点和错误，进一步加强领导的力量。我们在旧中国亲身经历过三大敌人的压迫和贫困落后的悲惨生活，现在，在中国共产党领导下短短几年中完全改变了旧中国面貌，大大地提高了国际地位，我们每一个爱国的和有良心的工商业者，都是爱戴中国共产党、感谢中国共产党的。这次座谈会中揭露了不少缺点和错误，这不但没有使我们对于中国共产党的领导力量发生怀疑，而且更加增加了我们的信心。我们相信党定能明辨是非，纠正错误，更好地领导全国人民迈步前进。
    帮助党除“三害”是为了进一步加强党的领导
    在这次座谈会中大家所揭露出来的问题，有些是个别的，有许多是比较普遍的。其中最普遍的是：一，对全行业公私合营后工商业者的进步估计不足，往往还有以“五反”前的资本家来看今日的工商业者。不少党员和职工对于统战政策的精神实质不够明确，有的甚至对我国有哪些民主党派、民主建国会是什么组织等常识都没有。二，公私关系、党群关系好的固然不少，不正常的也很普遍，私方在企业中往往有职有责而无权，积极性不能发挥。公私关系、党群关系固然是两方面的事情，有些问题是私方应该负责的，但是，不少公方看不见私方的积极性，也没有很好地体会国家对于工商业者改造的政策，片面地甚至错误地强调阶级关系，把私方当作外人。不少的公方对于业务是外行，又不尊重私方的意见，以致有形无形间给国家带来了不少损失。三，人事安排不恰当，不少私方的技术人员受到投闲置散的待遇，有力无处用。四，中小工商业者中间有一些人在生活上还有困难，目前可以解决的问题也不予以解决。这一些问题在不同程度上可以说各地都是存在的。
    国家把我们工商业者视作一项财富，我们多数工商业者也的的确确愿意尽自己的一切所长，为国家的社会主义建设作出贡献。但是，由于以上所说的问题的存在，往往打击了工商业者的积极性，造成了公私之间、党群之间的距离。这些问题不解决，大家所指出的“墙”与“沟”是不可能拆除和填平的。
    但是，我们决不能由于这些问题的存在，就怀疑到社会主义制度本身或者党的领导。如果不重视目前存在的许多问题，不给予及时的解决，发展下去的后果是严重的；同时，如果把这些问题错误地认作社会主义制度的毛病，或者因而否认党的领导的正确，那更是不应该的。我认为，大家揭露出来的问题大部分是教条主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的表现。党中央和毛主席比我们任何人都看得全面和透彻，所以发动了这次全国性的大规模的整风运动。我们工商业者大“放”大“鸣”地揭露各种问题，帮助党整风，就是为了使党的队伍更加纯洁、党的威信更加提高，能够更好地领导社会主义建设。
    有些人把某些党员的缺点和党的领导等同起来，把资产阶级和工人阶级混同起来，把社会主义革命和资产阶级改良主义混同起来，对这些原则问题，必须明辨是非。
    在这次大“放”大“鸣”中，我们工商业者不少人对党作了尖锐的批评，并且提出了各种意见，这都是爱护党、信任党的表示。对于这一点，我们是绝对不能怀疑的。但是，决不能认为“争鸣”中一切意见都是正确的，党都应该照单全收。我认为，“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”是党处理和解决人民内部矛盾的正确政策，为了通过“放”“鸣”，能够很好地解决矛盾，使全国人民进一步团结一致，就必须明辨是非，区别那些是对的，那些是不对的，把对的肯定下来，把不对的予以解说和批评。
    在这次“争鸣”中，某些同志的某些看法是值得考虑的。根据我的体会，这次“争鸣”中有几个比较突出的问题，必须予以重视并且辨明是非：一，有些人把党在工作中的某些缺点、某些党员的缺点，和党的领导本身等同起来，从而怀疑到党的领导是否必要。这在讨论企业中应该不应该撤出公方、民主党派和工商联中应该不应该撤出党员干部的时候就有这种倾向。二，有些人在各种名词掩蔽下把资产阶级和工人阶级混淆起来，从而否认了工人阶级的革命性和领导作用。这表现在向工人阶级学习的争论中，也表现在目前阶级关系和两面性问题的争论中。有人认为资产阶级和工人阶级作为阶级来说是有区别的，工商业者和工人是没有区别的。这种把具体的人和抽象的阶级完全分裂开来的说法实质上就是否认两个阶级之间的区别。三，有些人误解和曲解国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，把我国的社会主义革命和资本主义的改良主义等同起来。这表现在对赎买政策和定息问题的争论上，也表现在工商业者现在还有没有两面性，还要不要进行改造的争论上。对于这些带有原则性的问题，我们必须明辨是非，不能因为别人提出不同意见就认为打击了“放”“鸣”。
    章乃器的论调，不仅把是非弄模糊了，而且会阻碍工商业者的进步。
    对于章乃器同志最近在报上所发表的几篇文字和谈话中的许多论点，我是不能同意的。他说“脱胎换骨”是增加工商业者无穷忧虑，说官僚主义比资本主义还可怕，说定息不是剥削而是“不劳而获”等等，不仅是我不能同意，我相信，正在社会主义大道上迅速前进的我们大多数的工商业者都是不能接受的。就以脱胎换骨这一句话来分析，在我们社会里，这是一句赞美称许的话，例如某人家的一个子弟向来不好好读书，行为不检，亲友为之痛心，现在他改好了，亲友高兴之下说：“你这个人进步了，完全改变了，竟然脱胎换骨了”。这是赞美之词。今天我们资本家把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者，怎么不能说是脱胎换骨呢？这是最合适的一句话，也是一句好话，怎么会引起无穷忧虑呢？又如资本主义与官僚主义，前者是一种剥削制度，后者是一种不良的工作作风，这样两种不同的东西怎么能相比呢？社会主义社会里有官僚主义，难道资本主义社会里没有官僚主义吗？难道社会主义社会里的官僚主义不是资本主义社会遗留下来的吗？难道资本主义社会能像社会主义社会那样揭露与批判官僚主义吗？这种道理实在是很明显的。又如定息，当然是剥削，又何必把它另起一个“不劳而获”的名词。难道说定息是剥削，我们资本家就抬不起头来，说定息是不劳而获就心安理得了吗？这种论调，工商业者骤然一看也许有些人会觉得深得我心，但是深入地一思考，就会发现这种论调对于我们的改造进步没有好处的。我们工商界愈来愈进步，就会有更多的人不同意这种论调。我认为，国家把我们当财富，这是一句实在的话，同时也是一句鼓励的话。至于我们工商业者自己尤其是骨干分子、代表人物则应该带动工商业者尽一切力量，贡献才能，同时反求诸己，时时检查自己的错误和缺点。在日常的社会生活中，你做了一件好事，人家说你了不起，是鼓励，而你自己却不应当自高自大地就以为自己了不起，要知道，谦虚使人进步，骄傲使人落后。我认为乃器同志这种论调的最大危害不仅把是非弄模糊了，而且会阻碍我们工商业者的进步。我们要的是诤友，要的是良药。今天共产党这样正确、伟大，尚且要整风，要求听逆耳之言，难道正在改造求进步中的工商业者不该听一些逆耳之言来提高自己吗？
    我认为，我们工商界要进步，要改造，要为社会主义作出贡献。我们民建会、工商联必须在这样的目标下团结起来，明辨是非，改进工作。
    社会主义是“争鸣”的思想基础。
    “百家争鸣”在思想体系上就是社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争。某些党员存在着官僚主义、教条主义和宗派主义，也就是无产阶级染上了资产阶级思想的灰尘。社会主义是我们“争鸣”的思想基础，争鸣的目的是为了提高我们的社会主义的思想认识。资本主义的思想方法是不能帮助党除“三害”的，更不可能要求党依照资本主义原则领导全国人民改变走社会主义的道路。
    我完全相信，党对于改正工作中的缺点和清除“三害”是完全有决心的。通过这次整风，党的领导一定会更加强有力，存在于某些党员身上的“三害”将不断地被清除，党的威信将更进一步地提高，全国人民将更紧密地团结在党的周围。
    通过这次整风，公私关系、党群关系都将逐步的正常起来，过去阻碍我们积极性的一切因素均将逐渐清除。我们在党的领导下将有比现在更好的工作环境和工作条件，使我们大家能够把自己的一切专长发挥出来。
    现在，正是第一个五年计划将超额完成、第二个五年计划将胜利开始的时候；对我们工商业者来说，正是加强自我改造，尽快地把自己改变为名副其实的劳动者的时候。不论为了国家的建设或者为了我们自己的改造，我们都应该在企业中和公方及职工一起，团结一致地展开增产节约运动，投入社会主义竞赛。这是我们国家当前的头等重要任务。我们工商业者有丰富的业务经验，不少人有现代的技术，我们如能积极贡献才能，我相信一定能够在增产节约中作出贡献，不仅有利于国家的社会主义事业，同样也有助于我们的自我改造。
