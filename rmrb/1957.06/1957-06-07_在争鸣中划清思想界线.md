    Delineating Ideological Boundaries in Debate
    Ruo Shui
    Debate is for seeking common ground, and seeking common ground is for pursuing a unified understanding of the truth and achieving further unity on that basis. But before seeking common ground, differences must first be established. Establishing differences means delineating boundaries and clarifying contradictions.
    Upon hearing "delineating boundaries," some may feel uncomfortable, thinking of "walls" and "ditches," etc. It is therefore necessary to explain: "Walls" and "ditches" are artificial and should not exist; as for lines, they exist objectively, representing the distinction between one thing and another, one thought and another. This distinction is precisely the premise of "debate"; otherwise, if all thoughts were the same, what would there be to "debate"? Of course, dialectics does not recognize any rigid boundaries, advocating that all things can transition and transform into each other, but lines always exist. Delineating ideological boundaries means distinguishing different thoughts.
    It is relatively easy to draw a line between Marxism and open bourgeois idealism. It is more difficult, but very necessary, to draw a line between Marxism and dogmatism and opportunism. The reason it is difficult is that dogmatism and opportunism both appear in the guise of Marxism; the reason it is necessary is that dogmatism and opportunism are both enemies of Marxism.
    Marxists must adhere to the basic principles of Marxism, while also flexibly applying these principles to specific environments and conditions, revising outdated theories, and creatively developing theory. Therefore, in Marxism, principle and flexibility are unified. "Left" leaning dogmatists cling to principle while abandoning flexibility, so their "principle" is a rigid principle. Right-leaning opportunists (or revisionists) utilize flexibility to negate principle, so their "flexibility" is unprincipled flexibility.
    The "principle" of dogmatists is not the principle of Marxism, because they violate the fundamental Marxist principle that theory must be linked to practice and constantly developed, absolutely fixing all principles. The "flexibility" of opportunists is not the flexibility of materialist dialectics, but subjective arbitrariness, relativism, and relativism is the absolute negation. Dogmatism that affirms everything is metaphysics, and opportunism that denies everything is also metaphysics.
    Dogmatists always boast of being "loyal" Marxists, and describe the creative application of Marxism as opportunism or revisionism. Opportunists or revisionists also portray themselves as "creative" Marxists, and describe loyalty to the basic principles of Marxism as dogmatism.
    "Left" leaning dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism seem to be opposed in form, but are actually quite similar. Both of them seem to be similar to certain aspects of Marxism in form, but are actually the opposite.
    Therefore, who is a Marxist and who is not a Marxist needs to be distinguished in debate.
    People like us are still Marxist primary school students, so we will also make dogmatic and opportunistic mistakes, but we must always strive to learn and improve our ability to distinguish in debate.

    在争鸣中划清思想界线
    若水
    争鸣是为了求同，求同是求对真理的一致认识，并在这个基础上达到进一步的团结。但在求同之前，必先立异，立异就是划清界线，辨明矛盾。
    一听到“划清界线”，可能就有人感觉不舒服，想到“墙”和“沟”之类，因此有必要解释一下：“墙”和“沟”是人为的，是不应该有的；至于线，那是客观存在，是某一事物和另一事物，某一思想和另一思想的区别。这种区别正是“争鸣”的前提；否则，各种思想都一样了，那还“争”什么？当然，辩证法不承认什么僵固的界线，主张一切事物可以互相过渡、转化，但线总是存在着的。划清思想界线就是区别各种思想。
    要使马克思主义同公开的资产阶级唯心主义划清界线，这是比较容易的。要使马克思主义同教条主义和机会主义划清界线，这就比较难；虽然难，却很必要。其所以难，是因为教条主义和机会主义都是以马克思主义的面目出现的；其所以必要，是因为教条主义和机会主义都是马克思主义的敌人。
    马克思主义者必须坚持马克思主义的基本原则，同时又必须灵活地运用这些原则于具体的环境和条件，修改过时的原理，创造性地发展理论。所以，在马克思主义中，原则性和灵活性是统一的。“左”倾教条主义者抱住了原则性而抛弃了灵活性，因此他们的“原则性”是僵死的原则性。右倾机会主义者（或修正主义者）利用了灵活性而否定了原则性，因此他们的“灵活性”是无原则的灵活性。
    教条主义者的“原则性”并不是马克思主义的原则性，因为他们违反了理论必须联系实际而不断地发展这一条马克思主义的根本原则，把一切原理绝对地固定起来。机会主义者的“灵活性”也不是唯物辩证法的灵活性，而是主观随意性，是相对主义，而相对主义也就是绝对的否定。肯定一切的教条主义是形而上学，否定一切的机会主义也是形而上学。
    教条主义者总是自诩为“忠实的”马克思主义者，而把对马克思主义的创造性运用说成是机会主义或修正主义。机会主义者或修正主义者也把自己描写为“创造的”马克思主义者，而把对马克思主义基本原则的忠实说成是教条主义。
    “左”倾教条主义和右倾机会主义形式上似乎相反，其实差不多。它们两者各和马克思主义的某些方面在形式上似乎差不多，其实相反。
    所以，谁是马克思主义，谁不是马克思主义，需要在争鸣中辨明。
    我们这样的人还是马克思主义的小学生，因此也会犯教条主义和机会主义的错误，但是，我们总要努力学习，在争鸣中提高自己的辨别能力。
