Get Industrial Products to the Countryside Early

The peak season market after the summer harvest is approaching. Commercial departments in Henan, Zhejiang and other places are concentrating their efforts to organize, transfer, and distribute sources of industrial products. The Henan Provincial Department Store, Knitting, and Cultural Goods Companies jointly held a provincial material exchange meeting to coordinate goods. Over 1.6 million yuan worth of goods were exchanged at the meeting.

The Jiaxing Special District of Zhejiang Province, under the personal leadership of the Commissioner, conducted a preliminary study and analysis of the market situation after this year's summer harvest. Given the general inadequacy of reserves in the commercial departments of various counties, it was required that each business unit replenish reasonable inventory within a limited time. The Anhui Provincial Department of Commerce, in addition to instructing various localities to inspect their inventory, promptly organize sources of goods, and distribute materials, also criticized any passive attitudes and practices of waiting and seeing, and staying put.

In the preparations for the peak season market after the summer harvest in various places, the prominent problems are: the goods in some areas have not yet been fully distributed to grassroots units; the phenomenon of uneven distribution of goods is relatively common. ·Fu·

    夏收后的旺季市场即将到来，河南、浙江等地的商业部门正集中力量组织、调运和下放工业品货源。河南省百货、针织和文化用品公司联合召开全省物资交流会，进行商品调剂，会上共交流商品一百六十多万元。
    浙江省嘉兴专区在专员亲自领导下，对今年夏收后的市场情况预先进行了研究分析，鉴于各县商业部门储备普遍不足，要求各业务单位限期补足合理库存。安徽省商业厅除指示各地检查库存力量，迅速组织货源和下放物资，并批判了任何观望不前、按兵不动的消极态度和做法。
    各地在迎接夏收后旺季市场的准备工作中，突出的问题是：有些地区的商品尚未全部下放到基层单位；商品摆布不平衡的现象比较普遍。　·夫·
