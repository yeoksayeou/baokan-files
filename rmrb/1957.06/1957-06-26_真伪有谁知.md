　　“Who Knows the True from the False?”
　　Dongguo Diji
    In Zhao Yiming's exposé of Zhang Bojun's words and deeds in the China Democratic League, published in the "People's Daily" on June 18, there is a passage that says: In his speech to "all comrades of the China Democratic League," he also mentioned the story of "Duke Zhou assisting King Cheng," meaning that the democratic parties have matured over the past year, and if the Party does not let go as it did in the past, it will make mistakes...

    Anyone with a little knowledge of history would know that this analogy is just nonsense and inaccurate. Regardless of the fact that the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is not like the relationship between Duke Zhou and King Cheng, which is a "ruler" and "subject" relationship, the assistance is also for the establishment of a socialist society, so we are working together towards the same goal. To talk about letting go or not letting go, it should also be inseparable from this principle; if it is only letting go for the sake of letting go, allowing it to deviate from the socialist track and from the leadership of the working class, I think there is no such thing as the obligation of "assistance."

    However, judging from his words and deeds, since he compares himself to King Cheng, we can see his "ambition" and "aspiration," and the essence of the so-called "letting go" is self-evident. In this way, we can also find a footnote to Chu Anping's so-called "Party's world" from the opposite side. There is a reason for the remarks, who can believe that Chu Anping is "original"?

    Since this right-wing gentleman likes to talk about "Duke Zhou and King Cheng," I can't help but think of a story about "Duke Zhou and King Cheng" in history. Wang Mang of the Western Han Dynasty once compared himself to Duke Zhou (although he put himself in a different position from Zhang Bojun), and later generations wrote four lines of "praise" for him, saying:

    "Duke Zhou feared the days of rumors, Wang Mang was humble and courteous to scholars;
    If he had died that year, who would know the truth of his life?"

    I say this story not to be "disrespectful" to this right-wing gentleman. Wang Mang has a final conclusion in history, and Zhang Bojun is still "promising," and it is even more impossible to lightly give "praise" for "posthumous affairs"; but there are indeed similarities between the two. The key lies in the words true and false.

    The democratic parties are willing to take the socialist road and accept the leadership of the Communist Party. They have repeatedly expressed this more than once. The whole world knows it and the people have seen it. Now Zhang Bojun and his group have turned their backs and denied it. They have dropped a lot of tricks around a general issue: they don't want to take the socialist road and don't want the leadership of the Communist Party. Judging from moral standards, violating promises is betraying trust and righteousness; if we look at the time now, it is difficult to make people believe whether his promises were true or false; the five words "who knows the true from the false" already have objective facts to check, so it may not be out of my subjective speculation.

    Let us take a step back and study it. Duke Zhou was cautious and careful, deeply afraid of rumors about himself; and the result of Wang Mang's humility and courtesy to scholars, judging from the past, is probably "starting a business on his own," "developing 500,000 league members," leaving the socialist road, leaving the leadership of the Communist Party, and taking the so-called "middle road."

    There are many Chinese proverbs such as: "Time will reveal a person's heart," "True gold is not afraid of fire." Accepting socialism and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, these sweet words have not been around for too long, the words are still in our ears, are right-wing gentlemen like Zhang Bojun so forgetful?

    People's hearts need to be understood over a long period of time before they can be grasped clearly; gilding will reveal brass before long. The actual standard for judging true and false is not in the mouth, but in the test of objective facts.

　　“真伪有谁知”
　　东郭迪吉
    6月18日“人民日报”所载赵一明揭露章伯钧在民盟的言行中，有一段话说到：他在对民盟“全体同志的讲话中还提到‘周公辅成王’的故事，意思说，一年来民主党派已经成熟，如果党再像以往那样不放手，就会犯错误……”。
    这一比喻，略懂历史的人谁也会知道只是扯谈，并不确切。姑无论共产党和民主党派的关系，并不像周公与成王那样是“君”与“臣”的地位，就是帮助也是为了建立社会主义社会，才在同一目标之下共同奋斗的。要说放手或不放手，也应该离不开这一原则；如果仅为放手而放手，任其脱离社会主义轨道，脱离工人阶级领导，我看那就无所谓“辅”（帮助）的义务了。
    然而，就他的言行去考察，既以成王自况，就能看出他的“雄心”和“抱负”，而所谓“放手”的实质，也就可不言而喻。这样，我们也就可以从反面找到储安平所谓“党天下”的注脚了，话出有因，谁能相信储安平是“独出心裁”呢。
    这位右派先生既然喜欢谈“周公与成王”，不禁使我联想起历史上有一个有关“周公与成王”的故事了。西汉王莽曾以周公自比（虽然把自己放的地位与章伯钧有所不同），后人为他做了四句“赞”词，说：
    “周公恐惧流言日，王莽谦恭下士时；
    假使当年身便死，一生真伪有谁知。”
    我说这一故事，并不是对这位右派先生有所“不敬”，王莽在历史上另有盖棺定论，而章伯钧正在“有为”，更不可作为“身后事”轻下“赞语”；但二者之间，确有相似之处。其关键所在，正在真伪两字。
    民主党派愿意走社会主义道路，愿意接受共产党领导，曾不止一次反复的表示过，天下共知，人民共睹，如今章伯钧和他这一群，却翻脸不认账，围绕一个总的问题，掉了不少的枪花，不要走社会主义道路，不要共产党领导，从道德标准去衡量，违背诺言，就是背信背义；如果就目前看当时，就难以使人相信他的诺言，到底是真的还是假的；“真伪有谁知”五字，已有客观事实查对，就未必是出于我的主观揣测吧。
    我们姑且再退一步研究一下，周公惟慎惟谨，深恐流言及己；而王莽谦恭下士的结果，以古论今，大约就是“靠自己起家”，“发展五十万盟员”，离开社会主义道路，离开共产党领导，走所谓“中间路线”吧。
    中国有不少的格言如：“日久见人心”，“真金不怕火来炼”。接受社会主义，接受共产党领导，这些花言巧语，为时还不太久，言犹在耳，章伯钧等右派先生，就如此健忘吗？
    人心是要经过长时期认识，才能捉摸得清楚；镀金是过不多久，就会露出黄铜，判断真伪的实际标准，不在嘴巴，而在客观事实的考验。
