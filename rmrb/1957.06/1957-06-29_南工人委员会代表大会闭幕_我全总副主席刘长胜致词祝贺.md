Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, June 28th: The First Congress of the Yugoslav Workers' Council concluded in Belgrade on the afternoon of June 27th.
    After two days of discussion, the congress passed a resolution. The resolution summarized the experiences of the Workers' Council over the past seven years and determined that further development of worker autonomy in economic enterprises is the most important task. The resolution believes that the purpose of further establishing the Yugoslav economic system should be to distribute income more freely than before, to further establish the most equal possible production conditions in all factories, to strengthen the independence of enterprises, and to give play to the initiative of producers in order to improve management and increase output and labor productivity. The resolution called on the Workers' Council to conduct the widest possible cooperation in the future and to seek various forms of cooperation, connection, and unity between enterprises. The resolution finally called for a halt to nuclear weapons testing.
    The congress had been divided into six committees for the past two days. The issues discussed by these committees included: labor relations related to worker autonomy, the organization and working methods of the Workers' Council, the economic foundation of worker autonomy, the relationship between the Workers' Council and other organizations, and the economic activities of the Workers' Council.
    At the closing meeting on the afternoon of June 27, many foreign guests delivered congratulatory speeches. Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his congratulatory speech that the Chinese working class is paying attention to every achievement of the Yugoslav people in socialist construction with great concern. In giving play to the working class's enthusiasm and creativity in building socialism, all socialist countries have accumulated a lot of experience, which is worth studying and referencing. Yugoslavia has carried out experiments in democratic management in enterprises, adopting the form of the Workers' Council, and this experience has attracted our wide attention. The convening of this congress is meaningful for further exploration of this experience.
    Liu Changsheng also talked about the situation of enterprise management in China.

　　南工人委员会代表大会闭幕
    我全总副主席刘长胜致词祝贺
    新华社贝尔格莱德28日电　南斯拉夫工人委员会第一次代表大会6月27日下午在贝尔格莱德闭幕。
    大会经过两天讨论后通过了一项决议。这项决议总结了工人委员会成立七年来的经验，并且确定，进一步发展经济企业中的工人自治是一项最重要的任务。决议认为进一步建立南斯拉夫经济制度的目的应当是比从前自由地分配收入，进一步在一切工厂建立尽可能相等的生产条件，加强企业的独立性，发挥生产者的首创性，以改善管理，提高产量和劳动生产率。决议号召工人委员会在将来进行尽可能广泛的合作，并且谋求企业间的各种方式的合作、联系和统一。决议最后还呼吁停止核武器的试验。
    大会在过去的两天中曾经分成六个委员会进行工作。这些委员会讨论的问题有：有关工人自治的劳动关系、工人委员会的组织和工作方法、工人自治的经济基础、工人委员会同其他组织的关系、工人委员会的经济活动等。
    在6月27日下午的闭幕会议上，许多外来国宾致了贺词。中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在致贺词的时候说，中国工人阶级以莫大的关怀来注意着南斯拉夫人民在社会主义建设中的每一个成就。在发挥工人阶级建立社会主义的积极性和创造性方面，各个社会主义国家都已经积累很多经验，这些经验都值得我们研究和参考。南斯拉夫在企业方面实行了民主管理的试验，采用了工人委员会的形式，这一经验已经引起了我们广泛的注意。这次代表大会的召开对这一经验的进一步探讨是有意义的。
    刘长胜还谈到了中国企业管理的情况。
