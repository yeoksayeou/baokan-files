　　Ode to the Snow Mountain (and Two Other Pieces)
　　Yan Yi
    The snow mountain I imagined was high, steep, and sharp. Like a silver fir tree, reaching straight into space, tearing through the clouds. However, I was wrong. The real snow mountain is much higher than anything imagined; it is so high that it makes one think of the heavenly pillar that Qu Yuan sought in "Heavenly Questions," supporting and pulling the sky, as if afraid that the sky would be swept away by a storm or shattered by a hail of ice.
    The clouds, those red, purple, blue, white, and pale cyan patches, moved jostlingly, climbing from the mountainside upwards. Perhaps because the cliffs were too steep and slippery, they suddenly rolled down again, trembled, and climbed up again, truly like a group of fairies pursuing love towards the snow mountain, towards this hero who stands tall between heaven and earth.
    The snow mountain, clad in silver armor, head held high, stood steadily, motionless, as if intently watching something, listening to something, thinking about something, its face expressionless, appearing solemn and majestic.
    However, with the sunrise, I saw the snow mountain's radiant smile, smiling so kindly, so sweetly, and so affectionately.
    Ah! Such a familiar face of a hero!
    Searching
    I am a surveyor.
    I am searching, climbing mountains, wading through rivers, traversing deserts, roaming forests and valleys. Searching in the most dangerous and difficult places.
    I am searching for a kind of courage, a courage to overcome hunger and thirst in the desert, a courage to cross icy rivers, a courage to breathe freely on mountain peaks with little air, a courage to repel tigers and leopards and sleep peacefully in deep forests and valleys, a courage to change the world.
    I am searching for a kind of fire, a fire that can melt steel, gold, and silver, a fire that can burn away poverty, a fire that illuminates people's hearts, a fire that can measure the heat of my love.
    I am searching for a kind of black gold, a black gold that can level ten thousand mountains, a black gold that can reverse the command of rivers and oceans, a black gold that can eliminate the conspiracies of war, a black gold that can measure the strength of my love.
    I am searching for a kind of sea, a sea of coal, a sea of steel, a sea of gold, a sea of silver, a sea of oil, a sea of electricity, a sea of forests, a sea of water, a sea that can measure the depth and breadth of my love.
    I am searching, searching for a glittering, brilliant, and beautiful world.
    However, it is not just me who is searching, it is our entire motherland.
    Nameless Stream
    In the deep valley of the snow mountain, there is a very small stream flowing, flowing quietly. Although it sometimes makes a tinkling sound under a certain rock, it has not been discovered and praised, yet it flows endlessly.
    Its color is azure blue, looking at it makes one think of the cloudless clear sky and the calm bay at the end of autumn, and sometimes it makes one think of the affectionate eyes of a young girl.
    I don't know in which year, in which month, or for what reason, several boulders rolled down from the mountain peaks, blocking its path. However, it did not become sad or disappointed because of this, but calmly accumulated its strength. Finally, it overflowed the boulders and continued its path, advancing even more bravely.
    What the boulders gained was the stream's incessant roar and song.
    The stream became more optimistic, flowing forward joyfully. It met more brothers and sisters, united and flowed into the Min River, the Yangtze River, and into the sea.
    The famous fertile fields of the western Sichuan plain have its water droplets nourishing them, the sound of the Yangtze River's waves has its sound, and the sea's waves have its water flowers and character.
    People sing the praises of the sea and admire the Yangtze River, but do not mention the name of this small stream. However, this nameless stream is not saddened or discouraged because of this; it is still flowing, flowing, quietly contributing itself.

　　雪山咏（外二章）
　　雁翼
    我想像中的雪山，是又高，又陡，又尖。像一棵银色的杉木树，直直的向太空伸去，撕破了云层。然而，我错了，真正的雪山要比想像中的产物高得多，它甚至高得使人联想起屈原在“天问”中寻找的天柱，直直的顶着、拉着天幕，生怕天幕被一阵暴风卷跑，被一阵冰雹击塌似的。
    那云，那红的、紫的、蓝的、白的和淡青色的云块，拥拥挤挤的动着，从山腰向上爬着，也许，因为岩壁太陡、太滑，忽而又滚了下来，颤颤抖抖的又向上爬，真像向雪山，向这位顶天立地的英雄，追求爱情的一群仙女。
    雪山，披着银甲，昂着头颅，稳重的站着，一动不动，像专意的注视着什么，倾听着什么，思考着什么，面目没有表情，显得严肃而又威武。
    然而，随着日出我看见了雪山红光满面的微笑，笑得那样和善、那样甜蜜而又深情。
    啊！好熟悉的一幅英雄的面容呀！
    寻找
    我是一个勘测队员。
    我在寻找，攀登群山，涉过江河，跋过沙漠，漫游森林和深谷。在最危险、最艰难的地方寻找。
    我在寻找一种胆量，一种在沙漠里战胜饥渴的胆量，一种渡过冰河深江的胆量，一种在少有空气的山峰上自由呼吸的胆量，一种在森林深谷里击退虎豹，平安睡眠的胆量，一种改变世界的胆量。
    我在寻找一种火，一种能熔炼钢铁、金银的火，一种能烧灭贫困的火，一种照亮人心的火，一种能衡量我爱的热度的火。
    我在寻找一种乌金，一种能击平万山的乌金；一种能扭转指挥江河海洋的乌金，一种能消除战争阴谋的乌金，一种能衡量我爱的强度的乌金。
    我在寻找一种海，一种煤的海、钢的海、金的海、银的海、油的海、电的海、林的海、水的海，一种能衡量我爱的深度和广度的海。
    我在寻找，寻找一个金光闪闪，灿烂美丽的世界。
    然而，在寻找着的，不是我一个，是我们整个的祖国。
    无名小溪
    雪山的深谷里，有一股很小很小的溪水在流着，静悄悄的流着。虽然在某一个岩石下也曾发出叮叮咚咚的声音，却并没有被人发现和赞美，然而，它却永不休止的流着。
    它的颜色碧蓝碧蓝，看它一眼，使人想起无云的晴空和秋末无风的海湾，也有时使人想起少女含情的眼睛。
    不知道是哪一年、哪一月，是什么缘故，从山峰上滚下了几块巨石，挡住了它的去路，然而，它并不因此悲伤、失望，仍是沉着的积蓄着自己的力量，终于，它漫过了巨石，继续着自己的道路，更勇猛的前进了。
    巨石所获得的，是溪水不止的咆哮和歌唱。
    溪水更乐观了，欢腾的向前奔流。结识了更多的兄弟、姊妹，团结一致的流入了岷江、长江，流入了大海。
    川西平原有名的肥田里有它的水滴滋养，长江的浪声里有它的音响，大海的波涛里有它的水花和性格。
    人们歌颂着大海，赞美着长江，并不提起这小溪的名字，然而，这无名的小溪并不因此而悲伤、丧气，它仍在流着、流着，悄悄的供献着自己。
