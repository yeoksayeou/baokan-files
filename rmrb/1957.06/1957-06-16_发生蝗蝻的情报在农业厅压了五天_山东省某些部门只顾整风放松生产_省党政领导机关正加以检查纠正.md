　　Information on Locust Nymphs Suppressed in the Department of Agriculture for Five Days
　　Certain Departments in Shandong Province Only Focus on Rectification Campaigns, Relaxing Production
　　Provincial Party and Government Leading Organs Are Inspecting and Correcting This

    This Dispatch from our reporter Xiao Yan: Whether party and government leaders at all levels can seize the opportunity and concentrate their efforts to immediately take charge of the leadership of current agricultural production has become an urgent problem to be solved in Shandong Province's rural work.

    The current situation is: many leading cadres do not adequately recognize the great significance of doing a good job in production and achieving a bumper harvest as the material basis for correctly resolving internal contradictions among the people. In many areas, the leadership of agricultural production is somewhat laissez-faire. Some relevant departments are busy with rectification campaigns and have relaxed their leadership over production. Some prefectural and administrative offices have also failed to ensure that production and rectification campaigns are carried out without neglecting each other.

    The current situation of agricultural production in Shandong Province is as follows: More than 6.2 million mu of wheat in the province has matured, and most areas are harvesting. The wheat harvest is equal to or slightly higher than last year. Due to erratic weather, there was continuous rain in early June, and mold and rot have occurred in some areas. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to organize rush harvesting. However, some areas have invested the majority of their strength in summer distribution and grain purchase work, and the focus of leadership has not truly been placed on production.

    The quality of spring sowing this year has improved somewhat compared to last year. Seedlings are generally complete, and diversified operations are better than last year. However, the sown area of high-yield crops has decreased, especially because of drought and other reasons, cotton and peanuts have not been able to complete the sowing plan; the phenomenon of weak and dead draft animals is still serious; small-scale water conservancy construction is not as much as last year; and funds and fertilizers are still insufficient. These are all difficulties in production.

    Currently, the biggest threat to agricultural production is that locust nymphs have been found in more than 2 million mu of land throughout the province and are continuing to expand. Cotton aphids are widespread. Corn borers have also been discovered.

    The above situation shows that Shandong Province's task of striving for a bumper harvest this year is very arduous. This requires leaders at all levels to truly come up with every possible means and make arduous efforts to strive for a bumper harvest.

    Based on the above situation, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee issued notices on May 31st and June 10th respectively on strengthening the leadership of summer agricultural production and striving for a bumper harvest. Several meetings were also held to check all aspects of production. Regarding the rectification campaign, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the propaganda meeting that the prefectural committee organs can postpone the rectification campaign in accordance with the actual situation during the busy farming season. However, according to the inspection by the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee on June 11th, some prefectural committee organs are still focusing on holding symposiums to "unleash" and "contend" greatly, and have relaxed their leadership of production; some first secretaries only focus on rectification campaigns and do not care about production; and some production leadership is only the responsibility of the commissioners. Recently, some provincial-level organs leading rural work have also experienced the phenomenon of relaxing leadership over agricultural production due to rectification campaigns. For example, the Department of Agriculture held a rectification meeting, and no one was on duty in the department. A report from Linqing County on the serious situation of locust nymphs arrived at the department on May 19th, and it was not sent to the vice governor in charge of agricultural production until the 24th.

    In order to immediately strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, the provincial-level leading organs convened a meeting and made the following decisions: (1) Based on the recent inspection situation, another circular will be issued, requiring party committees at all levels to unify their thinking and resolutely and quickly take charge of the leadership of summer agricultural production. Everyone must recognize that if the opportunity of the recent two or three months, which can still be used to strive to complete the plan, is missed, the annual harvest will be in danger of failing. (2) Under the current circumstances of tight farming, the rectification campaign should be subordinate to production, and the spirit of the rectification campaign should be used to actively overcome difficulties and solve problems in production. Relevant leading departments in the province should also allocate leadership to seize production, and should not conduct rectification campaigns behind closed doors. If the prefectural committee's rectification campaign can be slowed down, it should be slowed down. Currently, the first priority is to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in production. (3) Provinces, prefectures, and counties should send people down to conduct in-depth inspections of the completion of the plan and the existing problems; at the same time, find the reasons, find the experience, strengthen ideological and political work, mobilize the strength and wisdom of the masses into the production movement, and strive for a bumper harvest with all our strength. The primary task at present is to do everything possible to do a good job in summer harvesting, and to do everything possible to avoid mold and rot losses in wheat. Summer planting must ensure that it does not miss the farming season and improve the quality of sowing. At the same time, it is necessary to organize manpower to eliminate pests and weeds. The government's existing four aircraft are treating locusts in areas with serious locust infestations. In addition, it is also prepared to immediately allocate a large amount of pesticides and sell them on credit to agricultural cooperatives that are indeed short of funds for emergency pest control. In order to strengthen the leadership of current agricultural production, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to hold a joint meeting of responsible cadres from all relevant departments every Wednesday to promptly solve important problems.

### 发生蝗蝻的情报在农业厅压了五天  山东省某些部门只顾整风放松生产　省党政领导机关正加以检查纠正

　　发生蝗蝻的情报在农业厅压了五天
　　山东省某些部门只顾整风放松生产
　　省党政领导机关正加以检查纠正
    本报讯　本报记者肖彦报道：各级党政领导能否不误时机，集中精力立即把当前农业生产的领导抓起来，已成为山东省农村工作中一个急待解决的问题。
    目前的情况是：很多领导干部，对搞好生产，取得丰收是正确解决人民内部矛盾的物质基础的重大意义认识不足。不少地区对农业生产的领导有些放任自流。某些有关部门正忙于整风，对生产领导放松了。有的地委、专署机关也没有做到生产、整风两不误。
    目前山东省农业生产的情况是这样的：全省六千二百多万亩小麦，已经成熟，大部地区正收割。小麦收成和去年相等或略有超过。由于天气变化无常，6月上旬曾阴雨连绵，个别地区已发生麦子霉烂现象。必须抓紧时机，组织抢收、抢打。但有些地区把绝大部分力量投入了夏季分配、粮食征购等工作，领导重心没有真正放到生产上来。
    今年春播质量较去年有所提高，春苗一般齐全，多种经营较去年好。但高产作物播种面积减少了，特别是因为天气干旱等原因，棉花、花生都没能完成播种计划；耕畜瘦弱死亡现象仍严重；小型水利建设不及去年多；资金、肥料也还不足。这都是生产上的困难。
    当前给农业生产威胁最大的，是全省二百多万亩地里发现蝗蝻，且正继续扩展中。棉蚜普遍发生。玉米螟虫也有发现。
    上述情况说明，山东省争取今年大丰收的任务是十分艰巨的。这就要求各级领导真正想出千方百计，作艰苦的努力，才能争取大丰收。
    根据以上情况，中共山东省委和省人民委员会曾在5月31日及6月10日两次发出关于加强夏季农业生产领导争取大丰收的通知。并分别召开了数次会议，检查了生产的各方面情况。关于整风问题，省委在宣传会议上曾指出：农忙时期地委机关可以根据实际情况，把整风推迟一步。但根据省委办公厅6月11日的检查，有的地委机关仍在抓开座谈会大“放”大“鸣”，放松了生产领导；有的第一书记只抓整风，不管生产；有的生产领导只由专员负责。最近省级机关领导农村工作的部门，有的也出现了因整风放松对农业生产领导的现象。如农业厅开整风大会，厅内无人值班。临清县关于蝗蝻严重情况的报告5月19日到厅，24日才送到负责领导农业生产的副省长那里。
    为了立即加强农业生产的领导，省级领导机关又召集了会议，作了如下决定：（一）根据最近检查情况，再发一次通报，要求各级党委统一思想，坚决地迅速地把夏季农业生产的领导抓起来。让大家认清：如果错过最近两三个月的尚可争取完成计划的时机，全年丰收就有落空的危险。（二）在当前农事紧张情况下，整风应服从生产，以整风精神来积极克服生产中的困难和解决问题。省有关领导部门也应抽出领导力量抓生产，不能闭门整风。地委整风能放缓一步的就放缓一步，当前首先集中力量搞好生产。（三）省、专区及县都要派人下去，深入检查计划完成情况和存在的问题；同时找原因，找经验，加强思想政治工作，把群众的力量和智慧动员到生产运动中来，全力争取丰收。当前首要任务是想尽一切办法搞好夏收，极力避免小麦霉烂损失。夏种要保证不误农时，提高播种质量。同时要组织人力，消灭虫害、草荒。政府现有四架飞机正在蝗害严重地区治蝗。另外，还准备立即调拨大批农药，赊销给资金确实困难的农业社，紧急杀虫。中共省委和省人民委员会，为加强对当前农业生产领导，确定每星期三召开一次各有关部门负责干部联席会，及时解决重要问题。
