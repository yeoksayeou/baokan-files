　　Half-Month Agricultural Situation
　　Lesser Fullness (May 21st) – Grain in Ear (June 6th)
    During this period, the basic situation of agricultural activities in various regions is as follows: In the areas south of the Yangtze River, where rice production is the main focus, they are generally actively carrying out field management of early rice, some areas are transplanting mid-season rice, and many areas are preparing for transplanting late rice; the summer harvest and summer planting work in the areas north of the Yangtze River has begun successively.

    Summer Harvest and Summer Planting Begin Successively

    The fields in the main winter wheat producing areas are a sea of golden yellow, and the summer harvest and summer planting work has begun successively. The wheat harvest in Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces has entered a tense stage; the wheat harvest in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces has also gradually begun.
    During the wheat harvest, various regions generally strive to achieve fast cutting, fast transportation, and fast threshing, and pay attention to returning the grain to the home, and also pay attention to close integration with summer planting work. In Huangfeng, Wuxing and other four agricultural cooperatives in Niushou Township, Xiangyang County, Hubei, adopted the method of cutting, plowing, and planting simultaneously, and harvested more than 700 mu of wheat in two days, and rushed to plant more than 400 mu of sesame and millet.
    In order to help farmers carry out summer harvest and summer planting work in a timely manner, the leading organs of provinces, special districts, and counties have also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside, and the cadres remaining in the organs have also gone to the agricultural cooperatives near their residences to help farmers harvest wheat.

    Strengthen Field Management of Early Rice

    The vast number of farmers in the southern provinces are actively carrying out field management of early rice. Some agricultural cooperatives, in order to make each early rice seedling strong and achieve high yields per mu, carry out weeding and apply warm fertilizers in advance. The agricultural cooperatives in Rong County Special District, Guangxi, also proposed to apply a large amount of fertilizer before the rice seedlings are pregnant.
    While strengthening field management of early rice, in addition to some areas transplanting mid-season rice and some areas with earlier seasons transplanting late rice, many areas are preparing for late rice transplanting. In Nanping Special District, Fujian, 80% of the single-season late rice fields have been successively planted with seedlings. Some areas in Sichuan Province have also promoted the method of raising rice seedlings in the rows of corn to solve the problem of insufficient late rice seedling fields.
    The current problems are: the rice seedlings in some areas are not growing very well, the phenomenon of seedling rot is still serious, and fertilizer is also very scarce.

    Eliminate Fallow Land and Missing Seedling Land
    In the northern regions of our country, spring planting work has ended or is nearing completion. Currently, it is the period when autumn crops are emerging and growing. Some areas, after the spring planting work was basically completed, also conducted in-depth inspections of the planting situation and found the phenomenon of fallow land. Many places analyzed the specific reasons and took measures to encourage planting on fallow land, which has had very good results. Some agricultural cooperatives in Dongliao County, Jilin, used fallow land and idle land such as the edges of fields and threshing grounds to plant various oil crops. Many areas in Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces have universally carried out seedling inspection and replanting work.

    Tobacco Seedling Growth is Good
    This year, the national planting plan for flue-cured tobacco is 5,459,000 mu (slightly less than last year). Except for individual areas that cannot complete the planting plan, it is estimated that most areas can complete it. At present, the early tobacco in the southwestern tobacco-producing provinces has begun transplanting; the tobacco seedlings in the northern tobacco-producing areas have been thinned twice, and the seedlings are growing well; the winter tobacco in Yongding, Fujian, has begun baking, and it is expected to increase production by about 40% compared with last year.
    In the planting of flue-cured tobacco, various regions have carried out the adjustment of tobacco areas. Shandong, Anhui, Yunnan and other provinces have all appropriately reduced the tobacco planting tasks in concentrated tobacco areas and developed new tobacco areas; Henan Province has adjusted the tobacco planting tasks in some low-lying areas to other areas.
    Currently, the problems existing in the tobacco areas are insufficient fertilizer and drying barns.

    Fight Against Water, Drought, and Insect Pests
    Since May, the lack of rainfall in some areas of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China has affected the sowing of spring-sown crops and the growth of seedlings; some areas in Guangdong and Fujian provinces have been flooded due to continuous rainstorms. The farmers in the above-mentioned areas, under the strong leadership and support of the local Party and government leading organs, have actively fought against drought and floods, overcoming or reducing the disasters. Recently, many places in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China have generally received rainfall, and the drought situation has been alleviated. The farmers in these areas are actively replanting and rushing to plant.
    Due to some abnormal weather in the first half of this year, and less rainfall in some areas, various crop diseases and insect pests occurred earlier than in previous years. So far, locusts, borers, armyworms, red spiders, aphids, damping-off, anthracnose and other pests have appeared in some areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other places, harming seedlings. The vast number of farmers in these areas are taking various effective methods to vigorously eliminate and control them.

    Rectification and Production Go Hand in Hand
    Just as the tense summer harvest and summer planting season arrived, the rectification movement in organs above the county level in various places has gradually unfolded. In order to ensure that neither rectification nor production is delayed, the leading organs of many provinces, special districts, and counties have made comprehensive arrangements based on local conditions. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that the rectification and inspection of the special district and county levels and relevant provincial departments with summer harvest and summer planting tasks should be postponed to around July and August.

　　半月农情
　　小满（5月21日）——芒种（6月6日）
    这段期间，各地农事活动的基本情况是：以水稻生产为主的长江以南地区，一般都在积极进行早稻田间管理工作，部分地区在栽插中稻，不少地区为栽插晚稻作准备；长江以北地区的夏收夏种工作，已经陆续开始。
    夏收夏种陆续开始
    各主要冬小麦产区田野一片金黄，夏收夏种工作陆续开始。江苏、湖北、安徽等省的麦收工作，已进入紧张的阶段；山东、河南、山西、陕西、甘肃等省的麦收工作也已经逐渐展开。
    在麦收中，各地一般都努力作到快割、快运、快打，并注意颗粒还家，还注意了同夏种工作紧密结合。湖北襄阳县牛首乡黄丰、五星等四个农业社，采取边割、边犁、边种的办法，两天割麦七百多亩，并抢种了四百多亩芝麻、粟谷。
    为帮助农民及时地进行夏收夏种工作，各地省、专、县的领导机关，还抽出大批干部下乡，留在机关的干部也到驻地附近的农业社，帮助农民收麦。
    加强早稻田间管理
    南方各省的广大农民，正积极进行早稻的田间管理工作。有些农业社，为使早稻棵棵苗壮、亩亩丰产，提前进行耘草和追施暖性肥料。广西容县专区各农业社，还提出要在禾苗装胎前大量追肥。
    在加强早稻田间管理的同时，除一部分地区在栽插中稻、一部分季节较早的地区在栽插晚稻以外，不少地区在进行晚稻栽插的准备工作。福建南平专区占水稻面积80％的单季晚稻田里，已经陆续插下了秧苗。四川省有些地区还推行在玉米行间育秧苗的办法，来解决晚稻秧地没有留足的问题。
    当前出现的问题是：有的地区水稻秧苗生长得并不怎么好，烂秧现象还比较严重，肥料也很缺乏。
    消灭撩荒地和缺苗地
    在我国的北方地区，春播工作已经结束或接近结束，目前正是大秋作物出苗生长的时期。有些地区在春播工作基本结束后，还深入检查了播种情况，发现有撩荒土地的现象。许多地方分析了具体原因，采取了鼓励把撩荒地种上的措施，已有很好的效果。吉林东辽县有些农业社利用撩荒地和地边、场院等闲地，种植了各种油料作物。河北、山西等省的不少地区普遍地开展了查苗补苗工作。
    烤烟苗成长情况良好
    今年，全国烤烟的种植计划为五百四十五万九千亩（比去年略有减少），除个别地区完不成种植计划外，估计大部分地区可以完成。当前，西南各产烟省的早烟，已开始移植；北方烟区烟苗已间过两次，禾苗生长情况良好；福建永定的冬烟已经开始烘烤，预计可比去年增产四成左右。
    在种植烤烟中，各地进行了烟区的调整工作。山东、安徽、云南等省，都适当地缩减了集中烟区的种烟任务，并发展了新烟区；河南省把部分低洼地区的种烟任务，调整到其它地区。
    目前，烟区存在的问题是肥料和烤房不足。
    向水、旱、虫灾作斗争
    5月份以来，华北、东北、西北部分地区因为降雨量少，曾经影响到春播作物的播种和幼苗的成长；广东、福建两省的部分地区，则因为连续遭到暴雨，使部分农田受淹。上述地区的农民，在当地党、政领导机关的大力领导和扶持下，都积极地向旱灾、水灾进行了斗争，战胜了灾害或缩小了灾害。最近，华北、东北、西北不少地方已普遍降雨，旱象已有缓和，这些地区的农民正在积极补种和抢种。
    由于今年上半年气候有些反常，部分地区降雨量又少，各种农作物病虫害比往年发生得早。到目前为止，山东、江苏、河南、河北、山西、辽宁、青海、新疆等地部分地区，已出现蝗蝻、螟虫、粘虫、红蜘蛛、蚜虫、立枯病、炭疽病等危害幼苗。这些地区的广大农民，正采取各种有效方法，大力扑灭和除治。
    整风、生产两不误
    正当紧张的夏收夏种季节到来的时候，各地县以上机关的整风运动已经逐步展开。为了作到既不误整风又不误生产，不少省、专、县的领导机关，都根据当地具体情况，进行了全面的安排。中共河北省委决定凡有夏收夏种任务的专、县两级和省级有关部门的整风检查，推迟到7、8月前后进行。
