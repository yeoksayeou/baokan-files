Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 27th. The consensus among most people at the Xi'an section of Jiaotong University during an expanded school committee discussion held on the 24th and 25th is that Jiaotong University should and can move entirely to Xi'an.

The twenty-odd teachers, students, and staff who spoke at the meeting all stated that, considering the overall interests of the country, the future of Jiaotong University itself, the prospects for the development of industrial construction in the Northwest, and the current specific circumstances, Jiaotong University should and can move to Xi'an. They believe that although there are difficulties in moving the entire school to Xi'an, these difficulties are temporary and localized. With the joint efforts and support from all sides, actively creating conditions, the difficulties can be gradually overcome.

Lecturer Zhang Shi'en said: The discussion of the relocation issue is a question of what position should be given to current and long-term interests. He believes that more consideration should be given to long-term interests. At the same time, the interests of the whole country cannot be equated with the interests of Jiaotong University. National interests should be given more weight. He advocates moving entirely to Xi'an.

Some teachers who were originally hesitant about the relocation issue or opposed to moving west have now begun to change their views and support Jiaotong University taking root and flourishing in Xi'an. Among the thirty-two teachers in the engineering drawing teaching and research group, who almost all opposed relocation in the previous stage, twenty-two now agree that the school should move entirely to Xi'an, with two still having reservations, and no one opposing the relocation policy.

The Jiaotong University faculty and students are most concerned about whether the various disciplines of Jiaotong University can cooperate with local factories and carry out scientific research work, and whether the conditions in Xi'an are better than those in Shanghai in this regard. After recently listening to engineers from some factories in the city who came to the school for discussions and the school organizing some teachers to visit factories for observation, the teachers' views on these issues have changed somewhat. Many people feel that the external conditions for the cooperation between school disciplines and factories are currently inferior to Shanghai in some aspects, no worse than Shanghai in others, and even better than Shanghai in some. In the long run, Xi'an is better than Shanghai. Professor Ji Chengfan, director of the Metalworking Teaching and Research Group and director of the practice factory, believes that the conditions for carrying out scientific research work are better in Xi'an than in Shanghai. He said: Some factories in Xi'an are the newest in the country, and teachers can learn new things that cannot be learned in Shanghai. Although the connections with factories in Shanghai are better, some equipment is outdated and can only be used for small-scale experiments. He said: Scientific research work in schools should mainly be done in school laboratories. Good school equipment is the most important thing, and then comes the issue of cooperation with external factories and enterprises. Ren Menglin, Director of General Affairs, said when talking about the internal conditions for carrying out scientific research work: The heat treatment laboratory in Shanghai was converted from an old bathroom, with an area of more than 300 square meters. In Xi'an, the metal and heat treatment laboratory has an area of 3,500 square meters. The pressure processing and casting laboratories in Shanghai were originally converted from two old dining halls, with a total area of about 1,400 square meters. The two newly built laboratories in Xi'an have a total area of 3,800 square meters, and the casting factory has perfect automatic ventilation equipment.

Regarding the issue of faculty and student quality, several teachers believe that moving Jiaotong University to Xi'an will not weaken the faculty or reduce student quality. During the previous stage of discussing the relocation issue, some teachers worried that some older teachers with higher academic levels and teaching experience, as well as experts who had returned from studying abroad, would be unwilling to work in the Northwest, which would weaken Jiaotong University's faculty and affect the improvement of Jiaotong University's teaching and scientific research level. However, recently, judging from the plan put forward by Premier Zhou and the speeches of Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, and Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister, the country attaches great importance to Jiaotong University and has high hopes for it. All sectors of society have also expressed their willingness to strongly support Jiaotong University, so this will not affect Jiaotong University's faculty strength.

Many teachers disagree with the view that student quality will decrease after Jiaotong University moves to Xi'an. Lecturer Wu Bo'shi believes that the quality of students depends on the school itself and not on the region where the school is located.

There were also a few dissenting opinions at the meeting. Professor Zhao Fuxin agreed to move entirely to Xi'an, but he advocated relocating the school conditionally. He felt that the most important thing for moving to Xi'an was to have scientific research conditions. Professor Yin Dajun, director of the Physics Teaching and Research Group, believes that conditions should be created, difficulties should be overcome, and concerns should be dispelled to relocate the school. Bi Haojun, chairman of the Student Union, reflected at the meeting that students' views on the relocation issue have been changing recently. He said that the number of people who agree to move entirely to the school is increasing, and these people have a clear attitude and strive to realize the first plan proposed by Premier Zhou. Some students have a relatively vague view; they are mainly waiting to see the attitude of the teachers in the Xi'an and Shanghai sections. In addition, some students have resistance to the entire school moving to Xi'an.

Su Zhuang, Vice President of Jiaotong University, also put forward his views on the relocation issue. He said that he fully agreed with President Peng Kang's opinion. He believes that moving Jiaotong University entirely to Xi'an can maintain its integrity, and both disciplines and faculty can be preserved. He asked everyone to consider the overall situation when discussing the relocation issue, and to consider and place national interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests in appropriate positions. He said: Some teachers have pointed out that there are still many difficulties in moving entirely to Xi'an. This issue should be noted. He believes that according to the situation in all aspects, although there are many difficulties in moving entirely to Xi'an, the difficulties are much less than moving back to Shanghai. Su Zhuang believes that it is necessary for some teachers to propose taking measures to create conditions for relocation and overcome difficulties.

### 西安交大师生大部分人认为  交通大学应该全部搬到西安

　　西安交大师生大部分人认为
    交通大学应该全部搬到西安
    据新华社西安27日电  交通大学应该而且可以全部迁来西安。这是交通大学西安部分在24日和25日举行的扩大校委会讨论中大多数人的一致意见。
    会上发言的二十几位教师、学生和职员都谈到，不论从国家整体利益和交大本身前途着想，或者从西北工业建设发展远景和目前的具体情况考虑，交通大学应该并且可以迁来西安。他们认为学校全部迁来西安虽然有困难，但这些困难都是暂时的、局部的，经过各方面共同努力和支援，积极创造条件，困难是可以逐渐克服的。
    讲师张世恩说：讨论迁校问题是目前利益和长远利益应摆在什么位置的问题，他认为长远利益应多考虑一些。同时，全国利益和交大利益也不能等同。应该把全国利益放重一些。他主张全部迁来西安。
    教师中原来有一部分人对迁校问题摇摆不定或者反对西迁的，现在也开始改变自己的看法，赞成交大在西安生根开花。前一阶段几乎全部反对迁校的工程画教研组教师三十二人中，现在赞成学校全部迁来西安的有二十二人，还有保留意见的两人，没有人反对迁校的方针。
    交大师生们对学校迁来西安最关心的是交大各个专业能否同当地工厂配合并展开科学研究工作的问题，西安这方面的条件是否比上海好？教师们从最近听了本市一些工厂的工程师来学校座谈时所提供的资料、情况和学校组织部分教师去工厂观察后，对这些问题的看法，已多少有了转变。不少人感到学校专业和工厂的配合这一外部条件，目前有的不如上海，有的不次于上海，有的还比上海好。从长远来看，西安胜于上海。金属工学教研组主任和实习工厂主任季成璠教授认为展开科学研究工作的条件西安比上海好。他说：西安的有些工厂是全国最新的，教师可以学习到新的东西，而在上海就学不到。上海工厂虽然联系较好，但有的设备陈旧，只能作些小型试验。他说：学校里的科学研究工作主要应该在校内实验室里作，学校设备好是主要的，然后才是和外边工厂企业配合的问题。总务长任梦林谈到开展科学研究工作的内部条件时说：热处理实验室，在上海是旧浴室改的，面积为三百多平方公尺。在西安金属及热处理实验室面积有三千五百平方公尺。上海的压力加工和铸工实验室，原是两个老饭厅改的，面积共约一千四百平方公尺，在西安新建的两个实验室面积共达三千八百平方公尺，铸工厂并且有完善的自动化通风设备。
    对于师资和学生质量问题，好几位教师认为交大迁到西安，不致削弱师资力量，也不会影响学生质量降低。前一阶段讨论迁校问题时，有些教师担心部分学术水平较高、具有教学经验的老教师和留学回国的专家不愿到西北工作，因而会削弱交大师资力量，影响交大教学和科学研究水平的提高。但是最近从周总理所提出的方案，和高等教育部部长杨秀峰、副部长刘皑风的讲话来看，国家对交大很重视，希望也很大，社会各方面也表示要大力支持交大，不会因此使交大的师资力量受到影响。
    许多教师不同意交大迁到西安后学生质量会降低的看法。吴伯诗讲师认为：学生质量高低，决定于学校本身，而不取决于学校所在地区。
    会上也有少数分歧意见，赵富鑫教授是同意全部迁西安的，但是他主张有条件地迁校，他感到迁西安最重要的是要有科学研究条件。物理教研组主任殷大钧教授认为应该创造条件，克服困难，解除顾虑来迁校。学生会主席毕镐钧在会上反映，最近学生对于迁校问题的看法在变化中。他说赞成全部迁校的人数在增加，这部分人态度明确，力争实现周总理提出的第一方案。有一部分学生看法比较模糊，他们主要在观望西安部分和上海部分教师的态度。另外还有一些学生对于学校全部迁来有抵触情绪。
    交大副校长苏庄也提出他对迁校问题的意见。他说：他完全同意彭康校长的意见，他认为交大全部迁来西安可以保持完整，专业和师资都可以保存下来。他要求大家在讨论迁校问题时，要从全面去看，国家利益和个人利益，长远利益和目前利益都应考虑，放在适当位置。他说：有些教师提出全部迁来西安还存在着不少困难。这问题应该引起注意。他认为根据各方面的情况看来，全部迁来西安虽然有不少困难，但比起搬回上海去，困难总是少得多。苏庄认为有些教师提出采取措施为迁校创造条件，克服困难是很必要的。
