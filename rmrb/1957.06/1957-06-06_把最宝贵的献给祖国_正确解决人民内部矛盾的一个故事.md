    Giving the Most Precious to the Motherland
    ——A Story of Correctly Resolving Contradictions Among the People
    Lin Tian
    We took a car from Baotou to the iron mine of Baogang. After eating in the workers' canteen, we went to see the main mine. Steel pipes and rubber hoses, like long snakes, lay horizontally and vertically on the hillside. Air compressors roared, and dust-covered workers were drilling holes with rock drills, open-pit mining ore, laying narrow-gauge mine car tracks, and red trucks transported the ore to the railway station a few miles away. During the construction of Baogang, these mines were first used to support other steel plants. We climbed to the top of the mountain and saw a large pile of stones that had been excavated in the center of the summit. Braving the strong wind that made it difficult to stand, a comrade familiar with the mine introduced us: "This is the original 'Bayan Obo' (rich sacred heap or translated as Treasure Mountain). The mountain got its name from it. Throughout the mountain, you can pick up a piece of purple stone that contains 50-70% iron. It is truly a treasure mountain, the mother of Baogang!"
    For many years, herdsmen have regarded this treasure mountain as sacred. Today, they have dedicated it to the motherland for mining.
    A Heroic Story
    Regarding the story of Bayan Obo, we interviewed Wangqingsuren, Deputy Governor of Ulanqab League, whose father was the Prince of the original Darhan Banner (now merged with Mao Ming'an into Darmao United Banner) where Bayan Obo is located. We also interviewed Bayanduorong, Director of the Bayan Obo Office of Ulanqab League, who served as the Secretary of the CPC Banner Committee and Deputy Banner Head in this banner for seven years. They said: A long time ago (it is said more than 370 years ago), a hero from the Mongolian Darhan tribe who migrated from the north bravely sacrificed his life while leading his people in battle against the enemy. To commemorate him, people followed Mongolian customs and buried his iron helmet, iron armor, and other belongings on the top of this mountain and built an "Obo." It was revered as "Bayan Bogda" (Rich God). This "Obo" was named "Bayan Obo." From then on, the surrounding herdsmen would come to worship it every three years. Once, a hunter rested on horseback at the foot of the mountain, and his iron stirrup was attracted by the mountain. After that, people spread the rumor that there was treasure in this mountain, and "Bayan Obo" became an even more sacred treasure in the minds of the herdsmen.
    Approximately thirty-nine years ago, two Western foreigners came to inspect with a camel caravan. Fearing opposition from the herdsmen, they set up camp thirty miles away and then secretly came to survey. In 1944, Japanese imperialists forcibly conducted armed exploration. Under the anger of the herdsmen and the threat of anti-Japanese guerrillas, they withdrew after a few months. As soon as the Japanese soldiers left, the herdsmen went up the mountain to fill in the trenches and restore the damaged "Obo." The "Obo" caused…
    In July 1950, the motherland's own exploration team came to the treasure mountain for the first time. When the herdsmen heard that they were sent by the Central People's Government, they enthusiastically helped set up yurts, sent cow dung, helped find water, and led the way. The geological team's doctors treated the herdsmen's illnesses, and the accompanying Mongolian soldiers helped the herdsmen shear sheep. They got along like neighbors. But in October, when the exploration team planted flags and markers on the treasure mountain and dug trenches, the herdsmen became somewhat dissatisfied. They said privately: Is the People's Government also going to destroy our "Obo"? What exactly do they want to do, without discussing it with us? Then, new rumors spread across the grassland. Some said: Now they want to open the mountain and take the treasure. If the treasure is taken away, the rich feng shui will be gone. Some even said that there was a golden colt in the "Obo," and if it was taken away, disaster would befall.
    It seemed that a major national construction project had a conflict with the customs and habits of the Mongolian herdsmen. This was not a small problem. Socialist construction had to be carried out, and national policies could not be violated.
    Comrade Bayanduorong said: We had shortcomings in handling this issue at the beginning. At that time, we were still relatively naive. We knew that the construction of Baogang was related to the development and progress of the Inner Mongolian people, but we did not know how to correctly resolve this contradiction. Some of our working comrades said to the herdsmen: "Where are there any gods? Opposing construction is backward," thinking that this would solve the problem. Although the herdsmen did not say anything, they were very sad in their hearts. Some old herdsmen were afraid of being called backward and did not dare to go to the mountain to worship the "Obo," so they placed sheep and wine on distant mountain tops to worship.
    In 1952, the higher authorities learned about this matter and instructed us to conduct in-depth investigations, handle it cautiously, and ensure that the herdsmen were satisfied. Therefore, Mongolian cadres were sent to the herdsmen's yurts to listen to their opinions. They learned that the herdsmen had a special reverence for the "Obo," which contained the herdsmen's deep feelings of commemorating heroes and loving their homeland's mountains and rivers.
    After the cadres understood the situation and criticized their mistakes, they more carefully publicized the benefits of mining to the country and to the nation, and solicited opinions from people of all classes on whether the "Obo" could be relocated. After several months of deliberation, people of all classes agreed to relocate the "Obo." In the summer of 1953, the Ulanqab League allocated a special fund and sent the then Banner Head Wangqingsuren and old herdsmen to run all over the mountains to finally select the "Bayan Tsag" hilltop, more than forty miles south of Bayan Obo, with abundant wildflowers, as the new site for the Obo. Then, the mine workers helped the herdsmen dig open the "Obo," took out the three iron helmets, three sets of iron armor, fire rack, porcelain pot, and other items buried in the stone box under the "Obo," transported them to the new site by car, and built a tall pile of stones. Hua Ligebateer, the League Head of Ulanqab League, presided over a grand sacrificial ceremony. After the herdsmen sacrificed the Obo with whole sheep, mare's milk, and wine, they held a wild banquet, and then held a "Nadam" conference with more than a thousand people in Bailingmiao. At the wild banquet, an old herdsman named Damelinzhabu, who had guarded Bayan Obo for many years, cried with emotion while drinking wine. He said: Bayan Obo has awakened! The treasure mountain can be mined, and the "Obo" can also be worshipped. Only the Communist Party takes care of us like this.
    For a Happy Future
    Nowadays, many stories about herdsmen helping mine workers are circulating in the Bayan Obo mine. The undulating mine area used to have no roads. The current roads were made by the herdsmen leading the cars. The mine's water source was found with the help of the herdsmen. Just on the night of March 26 this year, three herding families rescued five lost aqueduct workers, including Liu Yehong, from a blizzard. Why are the herdsmen so enthusiastic about helping the mine construction? Let us listen to an old herdsman's words! This old herdsman is named Suhe. The people in the mine respectfully call him Old Man Suhe. For several years, he has been leading the way for the workers day and night, leading horses through the snow to find water for the workers. The water source for the water supply line currently under construction was found by him and another old herdsman. On the second day of arriving at the mine, a Mongolian youth comrade took us to visit him. He said: Mining is for the benefit of all Chinese people, and of course we have a share. Bayan Obo is now a stone, but in the future it will be steel, machines, grass mowers, and wool shears. In the past, when people talked about trains and grass mowers, some said: How can iron run, and can it cut grass by itself? Now the train has arrived at our doorstep. If you want to go far away, you don't have to ride a camel anymore. The grass mower issued by the government last year can do the work of hundreds of people. Bayan Obo used to have nothing, but now it has houses and shops. Director Ba (Bayanduorong) said that this year they will build a building and in the future, they will build schools and hospitals, which have never been seen on the grassland. I will see them all in my lifetime…
    Deputy Governor Wangqingsuren told us that an old herdsman who used to worry that mining would destroy the "Obo" said to him: This rich place has truly become rich this time, and it will take us to socialism!

    把最宝贵的献给祖国
    ——正确解决人民内部矛盾的一个故事
    林田
    我们从包头乘汽车去包钢的铁矿山。我们在工人食堂里吃过饭，就去看主矿山。长蛇似的钢管、橡皮管，横一道竖一道地卧在半山腰，空气压缩机轰轰价响，满身尘沙的工人们正掌着凿岩机钻孔，露天开采矿石，铺设矿车窄轨，红色大汽车把矿石运往几里外的火车站。在包钢建设期间，这些矿就先用来支援其他钢铁厂。我们爬上山头，见山顶正中一个挖掘过的大石堆。背着吹得人站不稳脚的大风，一位熟悉矿山的同志向我们介绍道：“这就是原来的‘白云鄂博’（富饶的神堆或译作宝山）这山就是由它得名的。整个山上，你随便捡块紫石头，都有五、七成铁，真正是座宝山，包钢的母亲啊！”
    多少年来，牧人们把这座宝山视为神圣，今天他们把它献给祖国来开采了。
    英雄的故事
    关于白云鄂博的故事，我们访问过乌兰察布盟副盟长旺庆苏仁，他的父亲，就是白云鄂博所在的原达尔罕旗（今已与茂明安合并成达茂联合旗）当年的王爷。访问了乌兰察布盟白云鄂博办事处主任巴彦都荣，他曾在这个旗作了七年中共旗委书记兼副旗长。他们说：很早以前（一说在三百七十多年前）从北方迁来的蒙古达尔罕部有个英雄，他在率领本部百姓和敌人作战中英勇牺牲了，人们为纪念他，就按着蒙古族的风俗把他的铁盔、铁甲等遗物埋在这山顶，修起了“鄂博”。尊为“白云博古达”（富神）。这“鄂博”就名“白云鄂博”，从那时起，四周牧民每三年来祭一次。有次，一个猎人在这山顶下马休息，铁镫被山吸住了。这以后，人们就传说这山中有宝，“白云鄂博”更成为牧人心目中神圣之宝了。
    大概是在三十九年以前，两个西方外国人带着骆驼队来察看，他们怕牧人反对，在三十里外下帐幕，然后偷偷来勘测。1944年，日本帝国主义者曾强行武装勘探，在牧民的愤怒和抗日游击队的威胁下，几个月后撤走了。日本兵刚走，牧民们就上山填平了壕沟，修复了被破坏的“鄂博”。由“鄂博”所引起的……
    1950年7月，祖国自己的勘探人员第一次来到了宝山，牧民们一听说是中央人民政府派来的人，就热情地来帮助支起蒙古包、送来牛粪，帮助找水、带路。地质队的医生给牧人治病，随来的蒙古族战士帮牧民剪羊毛，他们相处如同邻居。但到了10月，当勘探人员在宝山上插起旗子和标杆，挖掘槽沟时，牧民们就有些不满意了。他们背地里说：人民政府难道也破坏我们的“鄂博”吗？他们究竟想干什么，也不和我们商量一下。接着，新的传说也在草原上传开了。有的说：现在要开山取宝，取走了宝，富饶的风水就没有了。有的还说“鄂博”里有个金马驹，被取走了，天就要降灾了。
    看来，国家一项重要建设，和蒙古族牧民的风俗习惯之间发生了矛盾。这不是一个小问题，社会主义建设要搞，民族政策不能违犯。
    巴彦都荣同志说：我们开始处理这问题是有缺点的。那时我们还比较幼稚。我们知道包钢的建设关系到内蒙古民族的发展和进步，但我们还不知道怎样正确解决这个矛盾。我们一些工作同志向牧民说：“哪里有什么神？反对建设就是落后”，认为这样就把问题解决了。牧民们虽然嘴里不说，心里却很难过，有些年老牧人怕人说落后，不敢上山祭“鄂博”，就在远处山顶上摆上羊、酒来祭。
    1952年，上级知道了这件事，指示我们深入调查，慎重处理，一定要使牧民满意。于是蒙古族干部被派到牧民蒙古包里听取意见。他们了解到，牧民对“鄂博”是特别崇敬的，它包含着牧人们纪念英雄、热爱家乡山河的深厚感情。
    干部了解了情况、批判了错误，一方面更细致地向牧民宣传开采矿山对国家对本民族的好处，一方面向各阶层人民征求意见，能不能迁移“鄂博”。经过几个月的酝酿，各阶层人民都同意迁移“鄂博”了。1953年夏天，乌兰察布盟拨出一笔专款，派当时的旗长旺庆苏仁和老牧人一起跑遍了四山，最后选中了白云鄂博以南四十多里野花繁茂的“白云察卡”山头，作为鄂博的新址。于是矿山工人帮助牧民，挖开了“鄂博”，取出了埋在“鄂博”下石匣内的三个铁盔，三身铁甲和火架、瓷壶等物，用汽车送到新址，修起高大石堆。由乌兰察布盟盟长华里格巴拖尔主持举行了盛大祭仪。牧民们用整羊、马奶和酒祭过鄂博后，举行野宴，然后又在百灵庙举行了千多人的“那达慕”大会。在野宴中，一位看守白云鄂博多年名叫达梅林札布的老牧人喝着酒感动得哭起来了，他说：白云鄂博醒来了！宝山可以开采了，“鄂博”也可以祭了，只有共产党才这样照顾我们。
    为着幸福的将来
    如今，白云鄂博矿山中流传着许多关于牧民帮助矿山职工的故事。岗坡起伏的矿山附近从前没有路，现在的路是牧民领着汽车走出来的，矿山的水源是牧民帮助找的。就在今年3月26日夜里，还有三户牧民从暴雪里救出了刘叶洪等五个迷途的水道工人。为什么牧民这样热情地帮助矿山建设呢？让我们听听一位老牧人的一席话吧！这位老牧人名叫苏和，矿山的人都尊敬地称他苏和老汉。几年来，他不分日夜地为工人们带路，牵着马踏着雪为工人们找水，现在正建设的输水线的水源地，就是由他和另一位老牧人找到的。到矿山的第二天，一位蒙古族青年同志带我们访问了他。他说：开采矿山，是为全中国人民造福，我们当然有一份。白云鄂博现在是石头，将来就是钢铁、机器、打草机、羊毛剪。从前听人家讲火车、打草机，有人说：铁怎么能跑，能自己割草呢？现在火车开到家门口了，愿意到远处去，不必再骑骆驼了。去年政府发的打草机，一台能干百十人的活。白云鄂博从前什么没有，现在有房子、商店了。听巴主任（巴彦都荣）说，今年就修大楼，将来办学校、医院，草原上从来没有的，我这辈子都要见到了。……
    旺庆苏仁副盟长告诉我们说，从前耽心开矿破坏了“鄂博”的一个老牧人向他说：富饶的地方这次真富起来了，它要把我们带到社会主义去！
