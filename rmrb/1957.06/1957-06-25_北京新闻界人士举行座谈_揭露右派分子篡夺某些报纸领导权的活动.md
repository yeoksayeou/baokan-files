Xinhua News Agency, June 24th:

　　Beijing news circles began holding a forum today to expose the activities of bourgeois rightists in usurping the leadership of certain newspapers and to criticize the bourgeois journalistic views that have emerged in recent times. News figures from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, and other regions also participated in this forum. The forum was jointly convened by the Research Department of the All-China Journalists Association, the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, the Journalism Program of Peking University, and the Journalism Department of Fudan University.

　　Gao Ji of the People's Daily was the first to criticize the activities of bourgeois rightists at the meeting. He said that one of the key activities of the rightists was to compete for newspapers. Judging from the available materials, these activities were carried out in a planned manner. The case of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's tampering with the political direction of the Guangming Daily is one example. After Chu Anping arrived at the Guangming Daily, his first move was to squeeze out Communist Party members; then he sent reporters everywhere to stir up trouble, as if afraid the world would not be chaotic. The Wenhui Daily had a similar situation, and it is said that Luo Longji had given instructions to Xu Zhucheng before the revamp. In recent times, the Wenhui Daily and the Guangming Daily have published a large number of anti-socialist articles, such as the Wenhui Daily's reports on Sun Dayu and Liu Shahe. The Xinwen Daily also had Lu Yi taking the lead in vying for the leadership of the newspaper. Gao Ji also criticized the fact that at the news work forum held in Beijing in May, some people were looking for theoretical grounds for the rightists to seize the leadership of newspapers. For example, Zhao Qi of the People's Shipping News proposed to run so-called "newspapers owned by the people." They described the Party newspaper as a "newspaper owned by the organization," saying that the Party newspaper had three major shortcomings: some things were inconvenient to say, some things they dared not say, and some things they were not allowed to say. Therefore, the Party newspaper had reached a critical stage and could not continue to operate. They believed that only this so-called "newspaper owned by the people" could say everything. In reality, what they wanted to say were things that were anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-socialist, and the newspapers controlled by the rightists did indeed say these things. Gao Ji said that another theory was the "literati newspaper" proposed by Chen Mingde and others, and the "democratic newspaper management" proposed by others. They wanted to use the "literati newspaper" to oppose the Party newspaper. They believed that running a newspaper now was undemocratic. Gao Ji said that these two opinions mainly concerned the issue of leadership, and both opposed the Communist Party's leadership over newspapers, which meant running anti-socialist newspapers.

　　Gao Tian of the Guangming Daily spoke at the forum, focusing on exposing Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's activities in the Guangming Daily against the leadership of the Communist Party and against socialism. He said: Chu Anping first used the Guangming Daily under the guise of helping with the rectification campaign to disrupt the steps of the rectification campaign. He advocated using newspapers to push the airing of views down to the grassroots level; he wrote many letters to organize articles, saying that any article could be published in the Guangming Daily, and they wanted to turn the Guangming Daily into a "free forum." In terms of international news reporting, Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping also emphasized that the Guangming Daily was different from the Party newspaper. They advocated that the Guangming Daily should directly adopt news from bourgeois national news agencies, could adopt the remarks of bourgeois national newspapers, publish more news about socialist parties in bourgeois countries, and publish less news about communist parties in fraternal countries, which was also inconsistent with our foreign policy. Gao Tian said that in this way, they caused the Guangming Daily to deviate from the socialist path for a period of time. This incident shows that it is no longer possible to doubt that newspapers are tools of class struggle; whoever controls them serves them. The Guangming Daily incident is a painful lesson for our socialist journalism work and deserves our serious consideration.

　　Sha Ying of the People's Daily refuted Mo Rujian's and others' remarks that "Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated" in his speech. He emphatically stated that Lenin's principle that the newspaper is a collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer is not only suitable for the revolutionary period but also for the construction period. He said that we are building socialism today, and the transition from capitalism to socialism has not yet been completed. We must use newspapers to organize and educate the people so that they can actively participate in socialist construction. Moreover, if we do not use the newspaper as a tool of class struggle, others will. The recent situation of the Guangming Daily and the Wenhui Daily is proof of this. He said that we run newspapers according to Lenin's principles and by learning from the Soviet Union's experience. Of course, we must combine it with the specific conditions of our country and cannot mechanically copy it, but the position and viewpoint cannot be changed.

　　In addition, Huang Zhuoming of the Guangming Daily, Pu Xixiu of the Wenhui Daily, Zheng Baitao of the China News Agency, Mo Rujian of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, and Fan Sifu of the People's Railway Daily also spoke at the meeting. Huang Zhuoming explained the class nature of newspapers from the history of newspaper development and explained that the tradition of old newspapers can only be inherited in technical aspects. Pu Xixiu stated that Luo Longji's instructions to the Wenhui Daily were not true. Mo Rujian and Fan Sifu gave simple explanations of their speeches at the news work forum in May. Zheng Baitao expressed disagreement with some of the opinions at today's meeting. He said that newspapers under socialism can sing opposing tunes and can help with small criticisms. He believed that the news in our newspapers was "organized." He also said that it was not necessary for newspapers across the country to reprint the People's Daily editorial, and that other newspapers in the United States do not reprint the New York Times editorial. He also said that Chu Anping's sending Guangming Daily reporters to nine cities to hold forums could not be regarded as stirring up trouble everywhere.

　　This forum will continue tomorrow.

### 北京新闻界人士举行座谈  揭露右派分子篡夺某些报纸领导权的活动

　　北京新闻界人士举行座谈
    揭露右派分子篡夺某些报纸领导权的活动
    据新华社24日讯　北京新闻界人士，今天开始举行座谈会，揭露资产阶级右派分子篡夺某些报纸领导权的活动，并批判近一个时期出现的资产阶级新闻观点。参加这个座谈会的并有上海、江苏、山东、河北、辽宁等地的新闻界人士。这个座谈会是由中华全国新闻工作者协会研究部、中国人民大学新闻系、北京大学新闻专业、复旦大学新闻系联合召开的。
    首先在会议上批判资产阶级右派分子的活动的是人民日报的高集。他说右派分子的重点活动之一就是争夺报纸。从已有的材料看，这些活动是有计划地进行的。章伯钧、储安平的篡改光明日报政治方向就是一例。储安平到光明日报后，首先就是排挤共产党员；接着就是派记者到处点火，唯恐天下不乱。文汇报有类似情况，据说改版前罗隆基就曾对徐铸成发出过指示。近一个时期，文汇报、光明日报都发表了大量的反社会主义的文章，如文汇报关于孙大雨、流沙河的报道。新闻日报也有陆诒挂帅，出来争夺报纸的领导权。高集还批评了5月份在北京举行的新闻工作座谈会上有人为右派分子争夺报纸领导权寻找理论根据。如人民航运报的赵琪提出了要办所谓“人民群众所有制”的报纸。他们把党报说成是“机关所有制的报纸”，说党报有三大缺点，有些话不便讲，有些话不敢讲，有些话不准讲，因此党报已到生命垂危是办不下去了。他们认为只有这种所谓“人民群众所有制”的报纸才可以什么话都讲。实际他们就是要反苏、反共、反社会主义的话都讲，掌握在右派分子手里的报纸也确实这样讲了。高集说另一种理论就是陈铭德等提出的要办“同人报”，和其他人提出的“民主办报”，他们要用“同人报”来和党报对立。他们认为现在办报是不民主的。高集说这两种意见主要都是领导问题，都是反对共产党对报纸的领导的问题，也就是要办反社会主义的报纸。
    光明日报的高天在座谈会发言，着重揭露了章伯钧、储安平在光明日报的反对共产党领导、反对社会主义的活动。他说：储安平首先是借帮助整风之名利用光明日报来打乱整风的步骤，他主张运用报纸把鸣放推到基层；他写了很多信出去组织文章，说是在光明日报什么文章都可以登，他们要把光明日报变为“自由讲坛”。在国际新闻报道方面，章伯钧、储安平也强调光明日报和党报不同，他们主张光明日报要直接采用资产阶级国家通讯社的新闻，可以采用资产阶级国家报纸的言论，多登关于资产阶级国家社会党的新闻，少登兄弟国家共产党的新闻，这和我们的外交政策也是不符的。高天说，他们就这样使光明日报在一个时期离开社会主义的道路，这件事说明了完全不能再怀疑报纸是阶级斗争的工具，它掌握在谁手里就为谁服务，光明日报的事件对我们社会主义新闻工作是一个惨痛的教训，值得我们很好地考虑。
    人民日报的沙英在发言中驳斥了莫如俭等的“列宁的办报原则过时了”的言论。他强调地说明了列宁的报纸是集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的原则不仅适合于革命时期也适合于建设时期。他说，我们今天正在建设社会主义，从资本主义到社会主义的过渡还没有完成，我们必须用报纸对人民进行组织教育，使人民积极参加社会主义建设。而且报纸这个阶级斗争的工具我们不利用别人就要利用，光明日报、文汇报的最近一个时期的情况就是如此。他说，我们根据列宁的原则和学习苏联的经验来办报，当然要结合我们国家的具体情况，不能教条的搬用，但立场、观点是不能变的。
    另外在会上发言的还有光明日报的黄卓明，文汇报的浦熙修，中国新闻社的郑白涛，中国人民大学新闻系的莫如俭，人民铁道报的范四夫等。黄卓明从报刊发展的历史说明报纸的阶级性，并说明了继承旧报纸的传统只能限于技术方面。浦熙修声明罗隆基曾经对文汇报作指示不是事实。莫如俭、范四夫对他在5月份新闻工作座谈会的发言作了简单的解释。郑白涛表示对今天会上的一些意见不同意，他说，社会主义下的报纸可以唱对台戏，可以小骂大帮忙。他认为我们报纸上的新闻都是“组织出来”的。他还说人民日报的社论全国报纸不必要转载，他说纽约时报的社论美国其他报纸就不转载。他还说储安平派光明日报记者到九个城市开座谈会不能算到处点火。
    这个座谈会明天还要继续举行。
