　　Minjin Discusses the Problem of Guangming Daily Being Tampered with Politically, Demanding Thorough Investigation of Zhang Bojun's Responsibility
　　
    This newspaper reports that the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), also known as Minjin, held an enlarged meeting of its Central Standing Committee last night. The meeting first discussed the problem of Guangming Daily being tampered with politically. The meeting unanimously adopted the statement of the enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the CAPD regarding the incident of Guangming Daily being tampered with politically. In addition to stating that the CAPD cannot share responsibility for the problem of Guangming Daily being tampered with politically, the statement raised the following five questions to Mr. Zhang Bojun, the president of Guangming Daily:
    (1) Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and various democratic parties decided to strengthen their leadership over Guangming Daily, why has President Zhang Bojun consistently failed to convene a meeting of the editorial board for discussion?
    (2) The CCP Central Committee issued instructions on the rectification movement on May 1, explicitly requiring all democratic parties and non-party人士 to help the Communist Party in the rectification. Why did President Zhang Bojun not convene a meeting of the editorial board to discuss the guiding principles and steps to be taken by Guangming Daily?
    (3) From April 1, when Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping took office, until June 8, Guangming Daily published many inflammatory remarks and reports, and the layout and headlines of the newspaper clearly turned in the direction of bourgeois politics. Why did President Zhang Bojun never make any representation to the editorial board regarding this?
    As the person in charge of the Guangming Daily's affairs, what kind of instructions did Zhang Bojun give to Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping regarding the newspaper's guiding principles and tasks?
    (4) Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping openly published anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CCP Central Committee. President Zhang Bojun neither convened the editorial board nor invited the heads of various democratic parties to discuss the handling of the matter; is this intentional protection of Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping?
    (5) After Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping published his anti-Party fallacies, which aroused the indignation of the people throughout the country, President Zhang Bojun actually said that Chu Anping and Hu Feng "are about to become historical figures"? What does this mean? What is his position?
    The statement concluded that the role played by Zhang Bojun in this incident has its historical and ideological roots, and we demand a comprehensive investigation and thorough investigation. We also demand that President Zhang Bojun provide clear answers to the above points.
    Subsequently, the meeting criticized the rightist fallacies. Yu Zijie said in his speech: Zhang Bojun's self-criticism is a false self-criticism, intended to deceive the masses. He said that he was used by right-wing elements, but in reality, he himself is the head of the right wing. Their attack on the Party and socialism is a three-stage process: the first stage is to stand up to each other as equals; the second stage is to share the power equally; and the third stage is to replace the Party. Yu Zijie also said: Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun are together, do not separate them. Luo Longji's opinions are Zhang Bojun's opinions, and Chu Anping's words are also Zhang Bojun's words. Who can believe that he did not read Chu's speech beforehand?
    Liang Chunfu also believed that the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements must be viewed in conjunction. Zhang Bojun's proposed "political design institute" is an attempt to establish a bourgeois legislative body; Luo Longji's proposed "rehabilitation committee" is an attempt to establish a bourgeois judicial body; and Chu Anping's opposition to the so-called "Party's world" is an attempt to establish a bourgeois administrative body. This is a complete anti-socialist program.
    Zhao Puchu criticized some people who believe that the current criticism of right-wing fallacies in the newspapers hinders "freedom of speech." He cited a story from a Buddhist scripture: Two brothers each had a Saraca asoca tree. Each tree bloomed with a thousand flowers and bore a thousand fruits. One day, they suddenly discovered that both trees were infested with insects. The younger brother treated the insects while continuing to fertilize the tree, while the older brother believed that since the tree had insects, the tree had to be removed to get rid of the insects, so he cut down the tree. He said that our socialist cause is precisely a Saraca asoca tree. This tree is tall and large, with many good flowers and fruits, but it is also infested with some "insects," which are bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. The Party discovered these insects and called loudly for the treatment of the insects, and asked our democratic parties to help the Party treat the insects. Some right-wing elements, on the contrary, see neither the flowers nor the fruits, but only the insects, and they believe that since the insects are born from the tree, the "insects" must be removed by cutting down our socialist tree. Of course, the people will never agree with the right-wing elements' desire to cut down the tree, so it is necessary to immediately carry out counter-criticism to prevent the right-wing elements from harming the socialist tree. This is very timely and very necessary.
    Wang Shaoxian, Che Xiangchen, Lin Handa, Feng Binfu, Zhang Mingyang, Jin Zhixuan, Ge Zhicheng, Zhang Tingqian, Xie Bingxin, Zhang Jiyuan, Dong Shouyi, and Liang Ming also spoke at the meeting. Yan Jingyao made a written statement.

### 民进讨论光明日报一度被纂改政治方向的问题  要求向章伯钧彻底追究责任

　　民进讨论光明日报一度被纂改政治方向的问题
　　要求向章伯钧彻底追究责任
    本报讯　中国民主促进会昨天晚上召开中央常务委员会扩大会议。会上首先讨论了光明日报一度被纂改政治方向的问题。会议一致通过了中国民主促进会中央常务委员会扩大会议为光明日报一度被纂改政治方向事件的声明。声明中除说明光明日报一度被纂改政治方向的问题民进不能分担责任而外，向光明日报社长章伯钧先生提出下列五项问题：
    （1）自从中共中央提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，各民主党派决定加强对光明日报的领导后，章伯钧社长为何一直不召开社务委员会会议进行讨论。
    （2）中共中央5月1日发布关于整风运动的指示，明确要求各民主党派和无党派人士帮助共产党整风。章伯钧社长又为何不召集社务委员会会议，来讨论光明日报应采取的方针、步骤等问题？
    （3）光明日报从4月1日总编辑储安平到职起，到6月8日为止，在这一个时期内发表了很多带有煽动性的言论和报道，连同报纸的版面和标题明显地变成资产阶级政治方向，对此，章伯钧社长从来未向社务委员会作过任何表示，究竟用意何在？
    作为光明日报社务主持人的章伯钧对光明日报的方针任务，究竟向总编辑储安平作过怎样的交代？
    （4）储安平以光明日报总编辑身份在中共统战部座谈会上，公然发表了反党反社会主义的谬论，章伯钧社长既不召开社务委员会，又不邀请各民主党派负责人会商处理；是否对总编辑储安平有意庇护？
    （5）总编辑储安平发表反党的谬论后，引起了全国人民的愤慨，章伯钧社长竟说储安平与胡风“倒要成为历史人物”？这是什么意思？这是什么立场？
    声明最后认为章伯钧在这个事件中所起的作用，有其历史上、思想上的根源，我们要求加以全面的追究和彻查。并要求章伯钧社长对以上各点提出明确的答复。
    接着，会议对右派谬论作了批判。余子介在发言中说：章伯钧的检讨是假检讨，是在蒙蔽群众，他说他是为右派分子所利用，实际上他自己就是右派的头子。他们向党、向社会主义进攻是三部曲，第一部是分庭抗礼；第二部是平分秋色；第三部是取而代之。余子介还说：罗隆基和章伯钧是一起的，不要把他们分开来看，罗隆基的意见就是章伯钧的意见，储安平的话也就是章伯钧的话，谁能相信储的发言稿他没有看过。
    梁纯夫也认为必须把右派分子的反动言论联系起来看。章伯钧提出的“政治上的设计院”，是想搞资产阶级的立法机构；罗隆基提出的“平反委员会”是想搞资产阶级的司法机构；储安平反对的所谓“党天下”，则是想搞资产阶级的行政机构。这是一整套反社会主义的纲领。
    赵朴初对有些人认为目前报纸对右派谬论的批判是否妨碍“言路”的问题作了批判。他举一个佛经上的故事：兄弟二人，各有一棵无忧树。每棵树都开千朵花，结千个果。一天突然发现两棵树上都生了虫。弟弟就一面治虫，一面继续施肥，而哥哥却认为树既生了虫要除掉虫，就得除掉树，于是把树砍了。他说，我们的社会主义事业正是一棵无忧树，这棵树既高且大，花果又多且好，但也生着一些“虫”，这“虫”就是官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。党发现了这些虫，大声疾呼要治病虫，并且要我们民主党派也帮着党治病虫。而一些右派分子恰恰相反，他既看不到花，更看不到果，看到的尽是虫，而且他们认为既然虫是由树生出来的，要除“虫”，就得把我们的社会主义大树砍掉。当然，右派分子要砍，人民绝不能同意，于是就要立即进行反批评，免得右派分子损害了社会主义大树，这是非常及时非常必要的。
    在会上发言的还有王绍鏊、车向忱、林汉达、冯宾符、张明养、金芝轩、葛志成、章廷谦、谢冰心、张纪元、董守义、梁明。严景耀作了书面发言。
