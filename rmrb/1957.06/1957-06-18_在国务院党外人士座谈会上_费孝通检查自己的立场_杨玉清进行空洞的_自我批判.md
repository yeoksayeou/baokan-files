Xinhua News Agency, 17th - The Secretary-General of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, continued to invite non-Party members to a symposium this afternoon. Fei Xiaotong, Deputy Director of the State Council's Expert Bureau and Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said that he understood that the root of the many confused and erroneous thoughts in his mind in the past was that he had not firmly established his position, and because of this, ambitious rightists might want to take advantage of him and pull him onto their path.

　　Fei Xiaotong analyzed that his unstable position was due to his serious sentimentalism. This made him unable to distinguish right from wrong, make decisive decisions, and draw clear lines. Regarding wrong ideas, some he saw but did not argue against; some he felt were wrong, but he was not clear where the error lay; some he even felt were somewhat reasonable and even echoed.

　　He cited an example, saying that when he read the People's Daily editorial "Why is This?" on June 8th, he felt it was too fierce and the atmosphere was too tense. Therefore, on the 10th, he made a statement on "Those who speak are not guilty" and "Persuading people with reason." It was only the next day, when he saw the People's Daily linking his speech and Chen Xingui's agreement with him under a small headline, that he realized he had given cover to the rightists.

　　Fei Xiaotong said that his unstable position was also reflected in his attitude towards Chu Anping. When he saw Chu Anping's absurd statement about "the Party's world" in the newspaper, his first thought was, "That's bad, he said the wrong thing. Why didn't he ask a few more friends to look at it before taking it out?" At that time, although he felt there were differences between their views, it was still okay to have "a hundred schools of thought contend." Fei Xiaotong said that it was not until the workers came out to speak that he realized this was a major event, and on this major event, he "did not fulfill his responsibility as a friend to Chu Anping, nor did he promptly draw a line between his thoughts in principle."

　　Fei Xiaotong also expressed "great pain" for "having published many inaccurate statements about intellectuals in the past." He said that he used to think that the issue of the intellectuals' stance had been resolved in the ideological remolding movement, and that the ideological remolding of intellectuals had now entered the detailed issues of viewpoints and methods. Today, he believes that the transformation of intellectuals is, from beginning to end, a matter of changing their stance, and that it is unfounded to separate viewpoints, methods, and stance. He spread that kind of incorrect assessment, which fueled the tendency of some intellectuals to overestimate themselves and hindered ideological remolding. He said that the root of his misjudgment was still the issue of stance. If the stance is not firmly established, even if one feels subjectively well-intentioned and works hard, the result will not be serving the people.

　　Fei Xiaotong stated that he was determined to draw a clear line with the rightists. He wants to follow the Communist Party and not follow ambitious elements.

　　Wan Maizi, a State Council Counselor, believed that Fei Xiaotong's attitude of self-criticism was good, but Fei Xiaotong did not mention his motives and viewpoints for writing the articles "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" and "Before and After Early Spring," and how he now understands these two articles. Wan Maizi said that this would give people the impression that "he is just going through the motions" and feel that he has not touched the depths of his thoughts. He hoped that Fei Xiaotong would make further examinations.

　　Yang Yuqing, a State Council Counselor, said at the beginning of his speech that his speech at the law circles symposium on May 31st was not a matter of minor details, nor was it a matter of sharp language and disregarding the consequences, but a matter of the entire spiritual essence. He admitted that everyone pointed out that his speech was anti-Party and anti-socialist, which was in line with reality, and also admitted that what he said about "riding in a sedan chair, carrying a sedan chair" not only vilified the Party members, but also vilified those who supported the Party, and that "getting off the sedan chair, stepping down" not only attacked individual Party members, but also attacked the entire Party.

　　Yang Yuqing did not conduct a specific analysis and criticism of the essence of his thoughts, but only said emptily that he "is a person permeated with feudal ideas" and "at the same time a person permeated with bourgeois ideas." Then he defended himself, saying that he "received extremely profound education in the rectification movement" and also said "I should celebrate my new life."

　　Zhang Fengzhou, Deputy Director of the State Council Counselor's Office, said that today's Guangming Daily published that Zhang Naiqi actually said that Zhang Bojun was a "surrendered general." He asked Zhang Naiqi, "Who exactly did Zhang Bojun 'surrender' to?" What position does Zhang Naiqi stand on?

　　Li Guangyu, Qiao Qiming, Lin Fengbao, Wu Houhuan, Chen Jun, Xu Xingzhi and others also spoke at the meeting.

### 在国务院党外人士座谈会上  费孝通检查自己的立场  杨玉清进行空洞的“自我批判”

　　在国务院党外人士座谈会上
    费孝通检查自己的立场
    杨玉清进行空洞的“自我批判”
    据新华社17日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋今天下午继续邀请党外人士举行座谈会。国务院专家局副局长、中国民主同盟中央常务委员费孝通说，他明白了他过去脑袋里存在的许多糊涂错误的思想，根源就在于立场没有站稳，又因为这个原因，使野心右派分子可能想利用他，把他拉到他们的路上去。
    费孝通分析他立场不稳，是因为他具有严重的温情主义。因而使他不能明辨是非，当机立断，划清界限。对于错误思想，有些是看到了，但没有争；有些觉得不对头，但不清楚错在那里；有些还觉得有点道理，甚至加以附和。
    他举例说，他在6月8日那天看了人民日报“这是为什么？”的社论时，觉得太猛了，空气太紧张了。因此10日提出了“言者无罪”、“以理服人”的发言。只是在第二天看到人民日报把他的发言和陈新桂同意他的话用小标题联系了起来，他才明白他给右派分子打了掩护。
    费孝通说，他立场不稳还表现在对储安平的态度上。他在报上看到了储安平“党天下”的荒谬发言时，首先想到的是“坏了，他说错话了。为什么他不多请几个朋友看看才拿出去呢？”当时他尽管觉得他们两人看法有区别，但是不妨“百家争鸣”。费孝通说，一直等到工人出来说话了，他才觉悟到这是件大事，在这件大事上他“没有对储安平尽到朋友的责任，也没有及时地在原则上和他的思想划清界限。”
    费孝通还对他“在过去一段时间里，发表了不少对于知识分子估计不正确的言论”表示“很痛心”。他说，他过去曾认为，知识分子立场问题在思想改造运动中已经解决了，现在知识分子的思想改造已进入了细致的观点和方法问题了。今天，他认为知识分子的改造自始至终是个改变立场的问题，把观点、方法和立场割裂开来是没有根据的，他散播了那种不正确的估计，助长了部分知识分子对自己估计过高的倾向，阻碍了思想改造。他说，他这种估计错误的根源还是在立场问题。立场没有站稳，尽管主观上自己觉得好心好意，工作上辛辛苦苦，而结果却并不能为人民服务。
    费孝通表示，他有决心和右派分子划清界限。他要跟着共产党走，不跟野心分子走。
    国务院参事万枚子认为，费孝通自我检讨的态度是好的，但是费孝通没有提到他写“知识分子的早春天气”和“早春前后”文章的动机、观点和他现在对这两篇文章如何认识。万枚子说这就会给人以“他在过关”的印象，感到他没有接触到思想深处。他希望费孝通再作进一步的检查。
    国务院参事杨玉清在他发言一开头，就说他在5月31日法学界座谈会上的发言不是枝枝节节的问题，不是用语尖锐不考虑后果的问题，而是整个精神实质的问题。他承认大家指出他的发言是反党反社会主义的言论，是符合实际的，又承认他所说的“坐轿、抬轿”不但丑化了党员，同时也丑化了拥护党的人，“下轿、下台”不但攻击了个别党员，同时也攻击了整个党。
    杨玉清没有就他的思想实质进行具体的分析和批判，只是空洞地说他“是封建思想浸透了的人”，“同时又是资产阶级思想浸透了的人”。接着又为他自己表白，他说他“在整风中受到了极为深刻的教育”，还说“我应当庆祝我的新生。”
    国务院参事室办公室副主任张丰胄说，今天光明日报上载章乃器居然说章伯钧是“投降将军”，他问章乃器，究竟章伯钧“投降谁？”章乃器究竟站在什么立场？
    在会上发言的还有李光宇、乔启明、林风苞、吴候桓、陈钧、徐行之等人。
