Sister of the Commune
    Cheng Jingming

    What a lovable child! With a chubby little face, she smiles at everyone, waving her little hands and babbling. Only seven months old, she feels heavy in your arms. Who would guess that this child once had a tragic and moving story?

    The child's father, Peng Qingquan, is a poor Tujia farmer from Chefu Village in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. He and his wife raised a bunch of children, living frugally.

    On the first day of the eighth lunar month last year, after breakfast, Peng Qingquan was stacking grass with other commune members. The rural areas of Xiangxi are humid and rainy, and the grass is stacked on top of tall trees. Peng Qingquan climbed onto a tall fir tree several yards high, with three people below handing him bundles of grass. Unexpectedly, the tree trunk was too slippery, and Peng Qingquan lost his footing and fell from the tree, immediately losing consciousness. The three people shouted for a long time before finally waking him up. They saw that his left arm was broken and hurriedly fetched a bone-setter from afar.

    Poor Peng Qingquan was both in pain and anxious: a family of six mouths was counting on him for food; his wife was due to give birth to their fifth child in the next few days. What was he to do! Peng Qingquan was in pain for two days and two nights without closing his eyes, and only fell asleep groggily on the evening of the third day. In the middle of the night, he woke up and heard rustling sounds in the small room on the right. He was startled: could the child be arriving? He hurriedly woke up his eldest son, Minsheng, and asked him to take a bowl of eggs to his mother.

    Minsheng cooked three eggs and took them to his mother's room. Seeing his mother lying on her side facing the inside of the bed, he said, "Eat, Mom, don't let them get cold!" Then he went back to sleep.

    At dawn, Minsheng helped his younger siblings get dressed, but still didn't hear any movement from his mother's room, so he poked his head in to see. He saw that the bowl of eggs was still on the small stool. He called "Mom" several times, but there was no response. At this time, Peng Qingquan hurriedly supported himself up and asked Minsheng to help him into the room. He walked to the bedside, lifted the quilt, and saw that the child's mother's face was as white as a sheet of paper, her eyes were closed, and her forehead was full of veins, tightly hugging a naked little baby. Peng Qingquan couldn't stop his body from trembling, and he had no idea what to do. Minsheng knew something was wrong and ran to fetch an old woman from the village. The old woman felt around and said to the father and son, "If the placenta doesn't come out, I'm afraid the adult can't be saved." Then, she took out the newborn baby girl, washed her, wrapped her in a piece of torn cloth, and placed her at her mother's feet.

    Before long, the child's mother passed away. The children rushed to their mother's body and cried out. Four-year-old Minfen was stunned by the howling of her three older brothers. Peng Qingquan only felt a roaring sound in his head, and after a long while, he finally cried out. What to do! This family, this litter of children, this infant crying for milk... I really don't know how to survive.

    The villagers all came to comfort Qingquan. The production team leader brought people to carry five fir trees and asked a carpenter to make a coffin. Everyone helped to bury the deceased. In the empty bed, only a newborn baby was left. Who else would care about this little life! Even her father didn't expect her to survive. Several women in the village felt sorry for the child, but they couldn't take her in to feed her. They would come every half day to ask:

    "Has the little one not died yet?"

    Peng Qingquan looked at the kind neighbors and couldn't say a word.

    The little baby lay there alone, crying when she was hungry. So, the Minsheng brothers dipped their fingers in brown sugar and let her lick it. That's how they survived for two days.

    On the morning of the sixth day, Peng Daxi, the director of the agricultural cooperative, returned from a meeting in the township. He had received news in the township and, after discussing it with the township head, decided that the agricultural cooperative should find a way to support the little baby. The township head also called the county to request a relief fund of thirty yuan. As soon as the cooperative director returned to the village, he convened a meeting of the cooperative committee that night, asking everyone to discuss the matter of Peng Qingquan's little baby. All the members agreed to have the cooperative raise her. Several committee members immediately brought up an incident from not long before liberation: in Qiadongping, four miles away from this village, there was a Ma Laosan whose wife also died in childbirth. With no one and no money, and unable to support the newborn baby, he hardened his heart and pressed the crying infant into the coffin, burying her alive with her mother. Hearing this, everyone felt even sadder and said: in the past, individual households wanted to help but couldn't; now that we have the agricultural cooperative, we must find a way to save the child.

    The next day, the general meeting of commune members decided to ask Chen Mei, a female commune member from Mengkechao Village, to raise the child, and the cooperative would calculate her labor points at the rate of a medium-level laborer. Chen Mei's own child was already grown up, and she was worried that she wouldn't have enough milk, so the cooperative would allocate another one hundred and fifty catties of grain to make rice cereal for the child. They used the government's relief funds to sew some cotton clothes, lined clothes, and single shirts and pants for the child, bought a flowered hat, and some small socks. The remaining money was deposited in the cooperative, and two catties of sugar were bought for the child every month.

    After making the arrangements, the cooperative director took Chen Mei to pick up the child. They saw that the little body wrapped in rags was already red from being soaked in urine, and the tender skin was about to rot. Peng Qingquan lay on the side, both grateful and heartbroken; he looked at the cooperative director with tears in his eyes.

    Days passed by. The child was being taken care of, able to eat and sleep, and growing up quickly. She could smile and would raise her little hand to suck on her thumb. Everyone in the agricultural cooperative liked her. When commune members' meetings were held, someone would always hold her to attend. The commune members all praised the child for being clever, and everyone said that the agricultural cooperative had saved this poor child, so they gave her the name "Sister of the Commune".

    From then on, the name "Sister of the Commune" spread. When the female commune members of Chefu Village passed through Mengkechao Village to cut grass for the cattle, they would ask from afar, "Is Sister of the Commune being raised well?" Some commune members would even come in to hold her and kiss her, all saying, "Raise Sister of the Commune well, and when she grows up, let her go to school." The cooperative director also lived in Chefu Village, and he would go to see Sister of the Commune every now and then. Once, the cadres of the agricultural cooperative heard that the nanny was feeding Sister of the Commune rice cereal in the dark at night. They felt uneasy and discussed weighing five catties of oil from the cooperative to light a lamp for Sister of the Commune at night.＊

    The story of "Sister of the Commune" ends here. Recently, I made a special trip from Baojing County in Xiangxi, traveled more than sixty miles of mountain roads, to the Chefu Agricultural Cooperative in Shuiyin Township to visit "Sister of the Commune", and also interviewed Peng Qingquan and the people in the village. In Mengkechao Village, I held "Sister of the Commune" for most of the day, watching her jumping and lively, and I really couldn't describe what I was feeling. (Attached picture)

    这孩子多逗人爱！胖鼓鼓的小脸，见人就笑，舞着小手，咿咿呀呀说着话儿。才七个多月，抱在怀里沉甸甸的。谁会猜想到就在这孩子身上，曾经有着一段悲惨、感人的故事？
    孩子的爹，是湘西苗族自治州车夫村一个土家族贫农，叫做彭青全。夫妻俩养了一群孩子，俭俭省省过日子。
    去年阴历八月初一那天，早饭过后，彭青全同别的社员一起堆草。湘西农村潮湿多雨，禾草都堆在高树上面。彭青全爬到几丈高的杉树上，底下有三个人给他递草把。那晓得树杆太滑，彭青全站不稳脚，竟从树上摔了下来，顿时人事不知。三个人喊了半天，好不容易才把他叫醒过来，一看，左臂断了，慌忙从远处请来接骨大夫。
    可怜彭青全又是疼又是急：一家六张嘴，眼巴巴望着要吃饭；孩子的娘就在这几天要生第五胎。这怎生是好呵！彭青全疼了两天两夜没有闭眼，到初三晚上才迷迷糊糊地睡去。半夜，一觉醒来听到右边小房里悉悉索索的声响。他一惊：莫不是孩子要落地了，忙叫醒大儿子民胜，给他娘打碗鸡蛋送去。
    民胜煮了三个鸡蛋，端到娘房里。见娘侧着身子朝床里边躺着，便说：“吃吧，娘，别搁冷了！”自己又去睡了。
    天明，民胜帮着弟弟妹妹穿上衣服，还没有听见娘屋里有动静，便伸头看看，只见那碗鸡蛋还摆在小凳子上，连声叫“娘”，也没有答应。这时，彭青全慌忙支撑起来，叫民胜扶着自己，走进房里去。他走近床边，掀开被子一看，哎呀，孩子的娘脸色像一张白纸，眼睛闭着，额角上满是青筋，怀里紧紧搂着个赤条条的小毛孩。彭青全止不住身子直打颤颤，一点主意也没有了。民胜一看不好，就跑去把村里一个老婆婆请了来。老婆婆摸摸捏捏，对他父子说：“胎盘不下来，大人怕是没得救了。”说着，就把新生的小女孩抱出来，洗了洗，裹上一块破布，放在她娘脚边。
    不到一柱香的功夫，孩子的娘就咽了气。孩子们扑到娘身上直哭喊。四岁的民芬，被三个哥哥的嚎哭声惊呆了。彭青全只觉得脑子里轰轰的响，过了好一阵才哭出声音。怎么办哪！这个家，这一窝孩子，这嗷嗷待哺的乳儿……，真不晓得怎么活下去。
    乡亲们都来安慰青全。生产队长带人扛来五根杉木，请木匠做了一口棺材，大家帮忙把死者安葬了。空荡荡的大床上，只剩下一个刚出世的婴儿。还有谁来关心这个小生命呵！连她的爹也不指望她能活得了。村里好几家妇女心疼孩子，可是又没法子抱去喂养。她们隔半天就来问问：
    “毛伢儿没死吗？”
    彭青全望着善心的邻居，一句话也说不出来。
    小毛孩孤零零地躺在那里，饿了，就呱呱的哭，于是，民胜兄弟用手指沾点红糖，让她舔舔。就这么挨过了两天。
    初六早晨，农业社主任彭大喜从乡里开会回来了。他在乡里得到了消息，就跟乡长商量好，要由农业社想办法来养活小毛孩。乡长还打了电话，向县里请求发给三十元救济款。社主任一回村，当天晚上召开了社委会议，请大家讨论彭青全家小毛孩的事情，委员们个个都同意归社来养。有几个委员当场谈起了解放前不久的一件事：在离开本村四里地的恰洞坪，有个马老三，他老婆也是难产死了，没人没钱，求救无门，实在养活不了刚生下的小孩子，心一横，就把那哭着嚷着的婴儿按在棺材里，活活同娘一块儿给埋了。这一说，大家更难过了，都说：过去单门独户的，想帮忙也不济；现在有了农业社，一定得想办法救活孩子。
      第二天开的社员大会决定请猛
  科朝村的女社员陈妹抚养这个孩子，由社里按一个中等劳动力算工
  分给她。陈妹自己的孩子已经大了，怕奶水不多，就再由社里拨一百五十斤粮食，给孩子做米糊糊吃。用政府的救济款给孩子缝些棉衣、夹衣和单褂裤，买了顶花帽，还有小袜子什么的。剩下的钱存在社里，每月给孩子买两斤糖。
    安排好了之后，社主任就带着陈妹去抱孩子。只见那破布片裹的小身子，已经被尿水腌的通红，嫩皮都快烂了。彭青全躺在一旁，又感激，又伤心；他望着社主任直流眼泪。
      日子一天一天过去了。孩子有
  人照管，能吃能睡，长得很快。她会笑了，还会举起小手拇指塞在嘴里吃，农业社里的人，没有一个不喜欢。开社员大会的时候，总有人抱着她来参加。社员们都夸这孩子长得灵巧，大家都说是农业社救活了这个苦儿，就给取了个名字叫“社妹”。
    从此，“社妹”的名字传开了。车夫村的女社员们割牛草从猛科朝村经过，老远就要问：“社妹养得可好？”有的社员还进来抱一抱，亲一亲，都说：“把社妹好生养着，等长大了，给她念书上学堂。”社主任也住在车夫村，他隔不多久就去看看社妹。有一回，农业社的干部听说保姆夜里摸黑给社妹喂米糊糊，他们心里好生不安，便商议着从社里秤了五斤油，给社妹晚上点盏灯。＊
    “社妹”的故事，写到这里就完了。最近，我特地从湘西保靖县城走了六十多里山路，到水银乡车夫农业社去探看“社妹”，还访问了彭青全和村里的人。在猛科朝村，我还抱了“社妹”大半天，看着她活蹦乱跳、快快活活的样子，真说不出心头是个什么滋味。（附图片）
