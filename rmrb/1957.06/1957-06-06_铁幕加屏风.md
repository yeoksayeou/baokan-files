　　Iron Curtain Plus Screen

　　A special investigation committee of the French Radical Socialist Party was originally scheduled to go to Algeria at the end of April to investigate the atrocities of the French colonial authorities. On April 22nd, the French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, lowered the iron curtain, refusing them entry under the pretext of their "safety."

　　During this same period, the Paris authorities hastily organized a "Committee for the Protection of Algerian Rights and Personal Freedoms." Subsequently, the Socialist Party's newspaper, "Le Peuple de Paris," loudly proclaimed that in this way, France and Algeria "will live in peace from now on!"

　　What kind of organization is this committee, that the French authorities hold such great hope for it?

　　On May 8th, "Le Monde" of Paris published an article by the famous French lawyer Torlba, who refused to join the committee because this appointed organization made it impossible for him to fulfill the duties of a fair judicial officer. He said: "The so-called independent committee is actually impossible to be independent. This committee is deprived of the power to investigate... It is attached to the wings of the Governor-General, and it is impossible to cast any doubt on the words and deeds of the Governor-General."

　　It is said that among the members of this committee, in addition to some local officials, the most noteworthy is the old diplomat Poncel - a member of Pétain's fascist national committee in those years. After the Second World War, he still haunted the political arena, and between 1950 and 1955, he was the host of many anti-communist and anti-worker movement organizations. Recently, he and some reactionaries shouted loudly: "Whoever says there are atrocities in Algeria is completely slander and libel."

　　Many French newspapers have recently been constantly questioning how such a committee can effectively investigate the French colonialists' destruction of human rights and infringement of personal freedom in Algeria?

　　Originally, this committee was just a screen to match Lacoste's iron curtain, used to resist the tide of demands for investigation into the atrocities committed by the French colonialists in Algeria, and to cover up these crimes. No wonder the organ of the Mollet Socialist Party is so vigorously promoting this committee.

    铁幕加屏风
    法国激进社会党的一个特别调查委员会，原定4月底前往阿尔及利亚去调查法国殖民当局的暴行。4月22日，法国驻阿尔及利亚总督大人拉戈斯特拉下了铁幕，借口为了这些人的“安全”，拒绝他们前往。
    就在这同一时期，巴黎官方仓促间为阿尔及利亚组织了一个“维护阿尔及利亚权利和人身自由委员会”。接着，社会党机关报“巴黎人民报”便大事宣扬，说这样一来，法国和阿尔及利亚“今后当相安无事了！”
    这个委员会到底是什么性质的组织，何以使法国当局对它抱这样大的希望呢？
    5月8日巴黎“世界报”登载了法国名律师托尔巴的一篇文章，他拒绝参加这个委员会，因为这个钦定的组织使他无法履行一个公正的司法人员应尽的天职。他说：“所谓的独立委员会，实际上不可能独立。这个委员会被剥夺了进行调查的权力……它附设在总督大人的羽翼之下，根本不可能对总督的言行提出任何怀疑。”
    据说这个委员会的成员，除了一些地方官吏之外，其中最引人注目的是老外交家庞塞——当年贝当的法西斯民族委员会的成员。他在第二次世界大战后，仍然出没于政治舞台，在1950—1955年间，他是许多反共、反工人运动组织的主持人。最近，他和一些反动分子一道大叫大嚷：“谁说在阿尔及利亚有什么暴行，这完全是诽谤、中伤。”
    法国的许多报刊最近不断提出疑问，这样一个委员会怎能切实调查法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚摧残人权、侵犯人身自由的事情呢？
    原来，这个委员会不过是配合拉戈斯特的铁幕的一面屏风，用来抵挡要求调查法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚所犯的暴行的浪潮，并且掩饰这些罪行。难怪摩勒社会党的机关报要这样为这个委员会大吹大擂了。　　（樵）
