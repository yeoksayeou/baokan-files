A Child Can Leave Its Mother, But People of All Ethnic Groups Cannot Leave the Communist Party
Letters from People of Twenty Ethnic Groups Denounce the Conspiracy of the Rightists

(Reported by this newspaper) The attack of the rightists has enraged the people of all ethnic groups across the country. People from the Miao, Zhuang, Dong, Yao, Yi, Korean, Uyghur, Gaoshan, Naxi, Bai, Uzbek, Kawa, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Tujia, Yi, Nong, Mulam, and Xibe ethnic groups have sent letters denouncing the rightists. These letters use many vivid materials to prove: "A child can leave its mother, but the people of all ethnic groups cannot leave the Communist Party," and "Without the Communist Party, there would be no liberation for the people of all ethnic groups." "The rightists' conspiracy to shake the trust of the people of all ethnic groups in the Communist Party and to shake the determination of the people of all ethnic groups to take the socialist road will never succeed." Tian Yingchang and Long Tingxiang of the Miao ethnic group said in their letters that the Miao people are clear about their painful history. The rulers in history have always been demons who devastated the Miao people. The elders said that in order to seize the land and property of the Miao people, the rulers in the past drove the Miao people from the north to the south, from the plains to the mountains. In order to plunder the Miao people even more, the Kuomintang rulers established armed organizations such as security teams, plainclothes teams, border defense teams, and special agent teams in the Miao areas, and burned, killed, raped, and plundered the Miao people at will. Zhou Zhan, a participant in the forum for Hui small vendors and peddlers in Huainan City, Anhui Province, to criticize the rightists, wrote: Chen Yaoxuan, the Imam of the Muslim community in Huainan City and director of the No. 2 Sales Department of the jointly-owned cotton cloth store, said at the meeting: The Hui people have long suffered from the devastation of the rulers of the old society. He recalled that in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the rulers of Henan launched an armed struggle between the Han and Hui people. The struggle lasted for more than a year, leaving many villages short of food and water. More than 300 people were killed or starved to death in this struggle. Many letters say almost the same thing: The oppression of ethnic minorities by the rulers of the old society is endless and unimaginable. Luo Kaifeng of the Nong ethnic group cited such an example in his letter: When he was twelve years old, the rulers did not like the Nong people wearing their own costumes, so they ordered the town guards and security guards to strip off the clothes of the Nong men and women in the street and burn them.

Under this cruel oppression, the economic and cultural lives of the people of all ethnic groups became more and more backward. What made the people of all ethnic groups particularly sad was that the population decreased accordingly. He Guozhi of the Naxi ethnic group in Yunnan wrote: Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, more and more people were beaten to death, starved to death, and frozen to death. Villages with seventy or eighty families were left with only forty or fifty families, and small villages were reduced to flat ground.

All the letters say this: The Communist Party came, and the people of all ethnic groups were liberated. Tian Yingchang and Long Tingxiang said in their letters: In the past, the Miao people had almost no fixed residence. Now, not only do they have it, but also an autonomous county has been established. In the past, the Miao people ate wild vegetables, bark, and Guanyin clay. Now they eat rice. In the past, they lived in thatched huts and caves. Now, most of them live in tile houses. In the past, they wore ragged clothes and grass clothes. Now they wear new clothes. In the past, they covered themselves with grass quilts. Now they cover themselves with cotton quilts. In the past, people scolded us dumb Miao and dead Miao, but now the Communist Party helps us create writing and run schools. Huang Jiancheng, a young Zhuang student from Guangxi studying at Beijing Normal University, wrote: The Zhuang people seem to have crossed several centuries. Now, not only are they recognized as an ethnic group, but they also have autonomy and are on an equal footing with all ethnic groups. Various constructions are underway in the Zhuang areas. Power plants are being built one after another, roads are being built one after another, and schools are also increasing. In the past, there was only one middle school in a county, but now there are four or five. This is something that the Zhuang people never dreamed of. Huang Xiying of the Korean ethnic group wrote: Primary school education in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has implemented universal education, reaching an enrollment rate of 96%. The development of economic construction is also very rapid.

After comparing their lives in their letters, they denounced the conspiracies of the rightists. Zhao Yuguang of the Yi ethnic group in Sichuan wrote that after reading the anti-socialist remarks of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, and others, I really have to speak out. These political careerists are trying to lead the people of all ethnic groups back to a state of enslavement. However, the awakened people of all ethnic groups will not follow the political careerists. In several letters, the rightists were questioned: Gentlemen who have made anti-socialist remarks, you sing very well, but I have not seen you do much good for the country and the people! When the Chinese people were groaning under the iron hooves of imperialism, when the rulers of the old society were cruelly oppressing the people of all ethnic groups, and when the rulers incited the people of all ethnic groups to kill each other, why didn't you come out and show your skills? On the contrary, some people even helped the rulers speak. However, when the Communist Party exchanged its head and blood for the victory of the revolution, when the people of all ethnic groups united to build socialism, you came out, you became brave again, you issued anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks in the guise of the people, trying to seize the leadership of the Communist Party and lead the people of all ethnic groups onto the capitalist road. I tell you, this is impossible.

　　娃儿还可以离开娘　各族人民离不开共产党
    二十个民族人民来信斥责右派分子的阴谋
    本报讯　右派分子的进攻，激怒了全国各族人民。已来信斥责右派分子的有苗族、僮族、侗族、瑶族、彝族、朝鲜族、维吾尔族、高山族、纳西族、白族、乌兹别克族、佧佤族、蒙古族、藏族、回族、土家族、伊族、侬族、仫佬族和锡伯族等各族人民。这些来信用许多生动的材料证明：“娃儿还可以离开娘，而各族人民是离不开共产党的”，“没有共产党，就没有各族人民的解放”。“右派分子企图动摇各族人民对共产党的信赖、动摇各族人民走社会主义道路的阴谋是决不能实现。”苗族田应昌、龙廷香在来信中说，苗族人民对自己的痛苦的历史是清楚的，历史上的统治者始终是摧残苗族人民的魔王。老年人说，过去的统治者为了霸占苗族的土地和财产，就把苗族从北赶到南，从平原赶到山岭。国民党统治者为了对苗族进行更多的掠夺，在苗族地区建立了保安队、便衣队、边防队、特务队等武装组织，对苗族人民任意烧、杀、奸淫。安徽省淮南市回民小商小贩反右派座谈会的参加者周展来信说：淮南市穆斯林教长、公私合营棉布商店第二门市部主任陈耀轩在这个会上说：回族人民长期受着旧社会统治者摧残，记得民国二十四年，河南的统治者发动了一次回汉两族人民武装斗争。这个斗争进行了一年多，弄得许多村子缺粮断水，在这个斗争中被打死和饿死的就有三百多人。许多来信几乎都这样说：旧社会统治者对于少数民族的欺压是说不完、也是难以想像的。侬族罗开风来信中就举了这样一个例子：在他十二岁时，统治者不喜欢侬族人民穿自己的服装，于是命令镇丁、保丁当街把侬族男女的服装剥下来烧毁。
    在这种残酷的压迫下，各族人民的经济生活文化生活愈来愈落后。特别使各族人民难过的是人口随着减少。云南纳西族和国治来信说：在国民党反动派统治下，被打死和饿死、冻死的人愈来愈多，七八十家的寨子只剩下四五十家，小的寨子变为平地。
    所有的来信都是这样说：共产党来了，各族人民翻身了。田应昌、龙廷香的来信中说：过去苗族几乎没有固定的居住地区，现在不但有了，而且建立了自治县，过去苗族吃的是野菜、树皮、观音土，现在吃的是大米，过去住的是茅屋和山洞，现在大部住的是瓦房，过去穿的是破衣、草衣，现在穿的是新衣，过去盖的是草被，现在盖的是棉被。过去吃的是六十斤米换的一斤盐，现在吃的是二角钱买的一斤盐，过去人们骂我们哑苗子、死苗子，现在共产党帮助我们创造了文字，举办了学校。正在北京师范大学学习的广西僮族青年黄建成来信说：僮族人民好像越过了几个世纪。现在不仅被承认为一个民族存在，而且有了自治权，和各族人民处于平等地位。僮族地区的各项建设正在进行。发电厂一个接着一个的建设起来，公路一条接着一条修筑起来，学校也增多，过去一个县只有一所中学，现在有四所到五所。这是僮族人民梦想不到的事情。朝鲜族黄熙英来信说：延边朝鲜族自治州的小学教育已实行了普及教育，达到就学率的96％，中学生同1949年比较，增加了922％。经济建设发展也很快。
    他们来信中把生活作了对比之后，就斥责右派分子的阴谋。四川彝族赵宇光来信说，看了章伯钧、储安平、葛佩琦等人的反社会主义言论，我实在不能不说话，这些政治上的野心家，是企图把各族人民重新引导到被奴役的地位。但是觉悟了的各族人民是不会跟着政治野心家走的。在好几封来信中，对右派分子提出了这样的质问：发出反社会主义言论的先生们，你们唱的倒很好听，可是并没有见你们为国为民做了多少好事呀！当中国人民在帝国主义铁蹄下呻吟的时候，当旧社会统治者对各族人民残酷压迫的时候，当各族人民被统治者鼓动互相残杀的时候，你们为什么不出来显显自己的本事呢？相反的，有人还帮着统治者说话。然而，当共产党用头颅和鲜血换来了革命胜利的时候，当各族人民大团结为建设社会主义而奋斗的时候，你们出来了，你们又勇敢了，你们借着人民的外衣发出了反共反社会主义的言论，想夺取共产党的领导权，想把各族人民引上资本主义道路。告诉你们，这是办不到的。
