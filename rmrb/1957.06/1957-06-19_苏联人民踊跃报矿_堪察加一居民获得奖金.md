The Soviet People Enthusiastically Report Mineral Discoveries
Kamchatka Resident Receives Bonus

　　Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 18th – The Soviet Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection frequently receives packages of minerals. These packages are sent by farmers, workers, students, and office workers. Often, these minerals are studied by the Ministry Council, and the first discoverers receive the greatest respect.

　　According to Pei Hewei'er, Chief Engineer of the Eastern Geological Administration of the Ministry: Not long ago,伏金 (Fu Jin), a resident of Kamchatka, received a large cash reward because he discovered a sulfur mine in the Aleut region. After he sent the sample, an exploration team was dispatched there, and as a result, several rich deposits were discovered.

　　费多罗夫 (Fei Duoluo Fu), a member of a collective farm in the Irkutsk Oblast, picked up a green stone in the forest along the Aldan River and handed it over to the local geologist. Later, it was determined that there was the largest phlogopite (phlogopite is an electrical material) mine in the Soviet Union and one of the largest in the world. 费多罗夫 (Fei Duoluo Fu) received a bonus of 25,000 rubles, and the mine under development is named after 费多罗夫 (Fei Duoluo Fu).

　　苏联人民踊跃报矿
　　堪察加一居民获得奖金
    本报莫斯科18日电　苏联地质和矿藏保护部常常收到矿物的包裹。这些包裹是农民、工人、学生、职员寄来的。往往这种矿物由部务会议研究，最先发现者受到最大的尊敬。
    据这个部的东方地质管理局总工程师裴何维尔说：不久前，勘察加居民伏金受到一大笔现金奖励，因为他在阿列乌特区发现了硫磺矿。在他寄来样品后，一支勘探队就出发到那里去，结果探明了几个丰富的矿床。
    伊尔库次克州集体农庄庄员费多罗夫在阿尔丹河边森林中拣到一块绿色石头，把它交给当地的地质学家。后来探明那里有苏联最大而且在世界上也是极大的金云母矿层（金云母石是电器材料）、费多罗夫得到二万五千卢布奖金，已经在开发的矿层即以费多罗夫命名。
