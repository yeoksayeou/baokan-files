　　The Japanese People Will Force the Government to Change Its Policies
　　Nosaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party
    Our people are not only amazed by the great development of socialist construction in the People's Republic of China, but also have great expectations for it. At the same time, in this great socialist construction, they also see the path that our motherland, whose independence was taken away by American imperialism, should take in the future. In order to safeguard peace and develop our country's economy, our people demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the establishment of friendly relations. At present, this movement is growing and developing day by day. This movement also includes some capitalists and members of the Liberal Democratic Party. Because they see China's rapid development, they want to coordinate with China's second five-year plan to open up the difficult situation of our country's economy. Britain's withdrawal from the China Committee of the Paris Coordinating Committee has further strengthened this trend in Japan.
    Our people realize that the movement to demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is an important part of the movement to safeguard world peace, and an important part of the movement to liberate our Japanese nation from its subservience to the United States.
    China and Japan are neighbors, with a long-term economic, cultural, and human relationship of two thousand years. We also have deep relations in other aspects. The state of separation between our two countries only benefits American aggression and its world policy of preparing for atomic war. This is the result of the reactionary forces centered on Japanese monopoly capital selling out the interests of the Japanese nation and the Japanese people and following American policies. But the Japanese government's policy is bound to go bankrupt. This is clear from the following: When the People's Republic of China was founded, only our Communist Party demanded the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and called for the launching of a movement to restore diplomatic relations; but eight years later, the movement to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan has developed into a broad national movement, led by the working class, with participation from the Socialist Party to some capitalists, and the government and the Liberal Democratic Party are also increasingly feeling the pressure of this movement.
    In order to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, we will strive to unite all forces that can be united more widely and closely, establish the leadership of the working class in this movement, so as to force the Japanese government to change its policies.

　　日本人民将强迫政府改变政策
　　日本共产党第一书记  野坂参之
    我国人民对于中华人民共和国社会主义建设的伟大发展，不仅感到惊异，而且寄予很大期待；同时在这伟大的社会主义建设里，也看到了为美帝国主义夺去了独立的我们祖国今后所应走的道路。我国人民为了维护和平，发展我国的经济，要求同中国恢复邦交，建立友好关系。目前这一运动正在日益壮大，日益发展。这一运动也包括了一部分资本家以及自由民主党人士。因为他们看到中国的急速发展，想要同中国的第二个五年计划配合起来，打开我国经济的困难局面。英国退出巴黎统筹委员会的中国委员会，更加强了日本的这种趋势。
    我国人民认识到：要求恢复日中邦交运动，乃是维护世界和平运动的重要的一环，乃是使我日本民族从屈从于美国状态下获得解放的运动的重要的一环。
    日中两国处于比邻，有两千年来长期的经济、文化以及人的交往关系，在其他方面也有很深的关系。我们两国处于分离状态，只对美国的侵略和它的准备原子战争的世界政策有利。这是以日本垄断资本为中心的反动势力，出卖日本民族和日本人民利益，追随美国政策的结果。但日本政府的这种政策，必不免归于破产。这从下面这点看来，也是很明显的：在中华人民共和国成立当时，要求恢复日中两国邦交，呼吁掀起恢复邦交运动的，只有我们共产党；而八年后的今天，要求恢复日中邦交的运动，则已发展成为广泛的全国性的运动，以工人阶级为首，从社会党到一部分资本家都参加了进来，政府和自由民主党也日益感到了这个运动的压力。
    我们为了促进日中恢复邦交，将努力更加广泛紧密地团结一切可以团结的力量，在这个运动里树立起工人阶级的领导，以迫使日本政府改变它的政策。
