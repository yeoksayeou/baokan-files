Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 31st. Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna said in a broadcast on Cairo Radio on May 30th that all Arab countries support Egypt's right to prevent Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal.

He said that the 1888 Convention guarantees Egypt the right to self-defense or to take any necessary measures against enemy ships. During the seventy-four years that Britain occupied the Suez Canal area, Britain also supported this right. During this period—including the two World Wars—it prevented enemy ships from using the canal. In the past nine years, even major powers have not objected to this principle.

Speaking on the Algerian issue, Hassouna said that the League Secretariat had issued a memorandum to member states regarding the atrocities of France in Algeria. He also spoke about the attitude expressed by the United States. Hassouna said that regardless of the attitude of the major powers, the only way to solve the Algerian problem is to guarantee the freedom and self-determination of the Algerian people and to establish a national government in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 31st. Middle East News Agency, Khartoum: The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 30th stating that it had obtained intelligence that Israel was going to send a test ship through the Suez Canal, and if Egypt prevented the ship from passing, Israel would immediately send paratroopers to land behind Egyptian lines.

The intelligence also stated that, similarly, if Saudi Arabia prevented Israeli ships from passing through the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel would take similar military action against Saudi Arabia.

The Sudanese Foreign Ministry warned those countries that are instigating Israel to take aggressive actions against Arab countries. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry said that their actions may cause a global war; and emphasized that Sudan will stand with Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

    阿拉伯国家一致支持埃及
    阻止以色列船只通过运河
    苏丹外交部揭露以色列准备侵略埃沙
    新华社开罗31日电　阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳5月30日在开罗电台广播说，所有阿拉伯国家都支持埃及阻止以色列船只通过苏伊士运河的权利。
    他说，1888年公约保证埃及有权进行自卫，或对敌船采取任何必要的措施。在英国占领苏伊士运河地区的七十四年当中，英国也支持这种权利，在这个时期中——包括上两次世界大战期间——它阻止了敌国船只使用运河。在过去九年中，甚至大国也没有提出过反对这个原则的意见。
    哈苏纳在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时说，联盟秘书处已经向成员国发出了关于法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行的备忘录。他还谈到美国所表示的态度。哈苏纳说，不管大国的态度怎样，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一办法是保证阿尔及利亚人民的自由和自决权，并且在阿尔及利亚建立民族政府。
    新华社开罗31日电　中东通讯社喀土穆消息：苏丹外交部5月30日发表声明说，它已经获得情报：以色列将要派遣一艘试验船通过苏伊士运河，如果埃及阻止这艘船通过，以色列就要立即派遣伞兵在埃及后方降落。
    这项情报还说，同样，如果沙特阿拉伯阻止以色列船只通过亚喀巴湾，以色列就要对沙特阿拉伯采取相似的军事行动。
    苏丹外交部向怂恿以色列对阿拉伯国家采取侵略行动的那些国家提出了警告。苏丹外交部说，它们的行动可能引起世界性的战争；并且着重表示，苏丹将要同埃及和沙特阿拉伯站在一起。
