At a symposium convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC from June 2nd to 3rd, inviting representatives from various democratic parties and non-party democrats in the province, some non-Party figures criticized the dogmatic thinking prevalent in Henan's water conservancy work.

Li Fudu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and member of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), believes that Henan's water conservancy work should have a clear direction. He advocates well irrigation and small-scale water conservancy projects, and opposes the constant building of canals and large-scale projects. He also advocates attaching importance to soil and water conservation. He said that Henan has poor drainage conditions and is not suitable for developing canal irrigation, but the groundwater is abundant and suitable for developing well irrigation. If well irrigation conditions are good, canal irrigation may even be unnecessary. He said: "After the Yellow River is harnessed, it can irrigate 40 million mu of land, but to utilize the Yellow River water, we still have to build canals and gates. If we dig one million wells a year, we can irrigate 30 million mu. Let's calculate which method is faster? If we only focus on canal irrigation and first divert the Han and Yellow Rivers, it may raise the groundwater level and alkalize the land. Canal irrigation must also emphasize drainage. If surface water cannot be drained, coupled with groundwater, it will cause waterlogging."

Li Fudu pointed out that soil and water conservation should be emphasized. He said that if soil and water conservation work is done well, the lifespan of the Sanmenxia Project will be extended. If it is not done well, it will collapse in less than fifty years. Generally speaking, Henan's soil and water conservation serves mountain production. If the government systematically carries out comprehensive soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas and develops small-scale water conservancy projects, poor mountains can become rich mountains in just two or three years. Li Fudu said that if we carry out soil and water conservation in mountainous areas and vigorously promote well irrigation in the plains, combined with canal irrigation, the lives of the people of Henan will definitely improve year by year.

Li Fudu criticized the Henan leadership for not paying enough attention to scientific research. He said that the Yellow River governance is very complicated, and the problems encountered are new. Our own level is low, and we rely on Soviet experts to help solve problems, but we cannot always rely on them. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission does not pay enough attention to the research work on the Yellow River, and the research work is far behind the actual needs.

Li Baohe, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Department, pointed out: There are two lines in the water conservancy department: one is the line of engaging in small-scale water conservancy projects, and the other is the line of engaging in large-scale water conservancy projects. The former is the Party's line, but it has been at a disadvantage. The latter is contrary to the Party's line, but it has been in the upper hand. This is due to the dogmatism of the relevant leading departments. Then, Li Baohe cited many facts to illustrate the seriousness of dogmatism in the leadership of water conservancy work. He said that the province has 136 million mu of land, and the flood area is about 15 million to 20 million mu. Flood disasters generally account for 30% to 40%. Calculated at 40%, the maximum flood disaster area does not exceed 8 million mu, but the land with no harvest is only 4 million mu. However, the dogmatists say that flood prevention must be done first, and nothing can be done without flood control. Therefore, the dogmatists use 94% of the manpower and money to prevent floods, while the area affected by floods only accounts for 3% of the entire water disaster area (should be 3% of the entire cultivated land area - editor's note). This is using more than 90% of the manpower and money to do 3% of the work. Under the control of dogmatists, Henan Province has built five large reservoirs and repaired several large river channels in the past few years, but the tributaries are not dug on both sides of the river channels, resulting in "water in the middle, water on both sides," which is getting worse and worse.

In terms of flood prevention, dogmatists say that only building reservoirs can eliminate waterlogging. This is "all things are inferior, only reservoirs are high." Li Baohe said that according to his typical investigation in Yongcheng County, some small-scale water conservancy projects can completely prevent waterlogging at an average cost of one to three yuan per mu.

In terms of soil and water conservation, mountainous areas account for 100 million mu of land and need soil and water conservation, but no one pays attention to this work. There are 10,000 water conservancy cadres in the province, but only 40 cadres are allocated to soil and water conservation work, and the strength and money used are not commensurate.

Li Baohe pointed out that in Henan, to increase agricultural production and reach the central government's production increase target, the central issue is to do a good job in farmland water conservancy, that is, to build small-scale water conservancy projects, and the most important thing is to dig wells for groundwater. However, this work is not valued. There is no money or people for farmland water conservancy. Only 30 of the 10,000 water conservancy cadres are used for farmland water conservancy work, which is too disproportionate. Dogmatists say that farmland water conservancy is not feasible, irrigation requires diverting Yellow River water and Yangtze River water, which will take the fourth Five-Year Plan and cost more than 3 billion yuan. This is abandoning the near for the far. After this plan is realized, at least one special zone's land will be occupied due to the need to build canals. If small-scale water conservancy projects are built and well-digging work is carried out, it will not only be faster and more effective, but also cost less money, and can also occupy less or even no land.

Based on the above facts, Li Baohe evaluated the past water conservancy projects. He said: Compared with the Kuomintang period, the achievements of the past water conservancy projects are unprecedented, but measured by the requirements of the Communist Party, the achievements are not great and there are many shortcomings. He hopes to reverse the subjective leadership style and methods through rectification.

Finally, Li Baohe put forward the following suggestions:

First, it is hoped that through rectification, the subjective leadership style and methods of "left" leaning dogmatism and right-leaning conservatism will be reversed. This is not only a matter for the water conservancy department, but also for relevant departments such as the Finance Department, the Bank, and the Provincial Planning Commission; Second, strengthen investigation and research, and formulate a province-wide water conservancy plan based on the specific conditions of the province; Third, scientific experiments and research should be carried out, such as combining mass well-digging work to study the hydrological and geological conditions. Water conservancy technicians should also be vigorously trained to promote water conservancy technology; Fourth, agricultural cooperatives must also include irrigation in the production plan and implement a contract system; Fifth, do a good job in key experiments and establish the direction of water conservancy work; Sixth, rationally allocate water conservancy funds and use cadres rationally; Seventh, strengthen the political and ideological education of technical personnel. He said that if technical personnel study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" well, they will not make dogmatic mistakes.

Li Baohe proposed that in the future, if farmland water conservancy is carried out, the state only needs to invest one yuan per mu of land, and the masses invest three yuan, and water conservancy and mechanization can be realized. He suggested that the Provincial Party Committee study the suggestions and methods he put forward.

### 党外人士在中共河南省委召开的座谈会上  批评水利工作中的教条主义

　　党外人士在中共河南省委召开的座谈会上
　　批评水利工作中的教条主义
    在本月2日到3日中共河南省委邀请本省各民主党派和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会上，一部分党外人士对河南省水利工作当中存在的教条主义思想提出了批评。
    黄河水利委员会副主任、民革河南省委员会委员李赋都认为：河南水利工作应有明确的方向。他主张搞井灌和小型水利工程，不主张动不动就修渠，搞大型工程。他还主张重视水土保持工作。他说，河南排水条件不好，不宜于发展渠灌，但地下水丰富，宜于发展井灌。如果井灌条件好，甚至可以不搞渠灌。他说：黄河治好以后，能灌溉四千万亩地，但要利用黄河水，还得修渠修闸；假如一年打一百万眼井，就可以浇灌三千万亩，我们算一算，那一个办法来得快？假如只重视渠灌，先把汉水、黄水引来，还可能使地下水位提高，使土地碱化。搞渠灌又必须重视排水，假如地上水排不出，加上地下水，就会形成涝灾。
    李赋都指出，应该重视水土保持工作。他说，水土保持工作搞得好，三门峡工程的寿命就会延长，搞不好，要不了五十年就垮了。一般来说，河南的水土保持是为山区生产服务的。假如政府有计划地开展山区的综合性的水土保持工作，发展山区的小型水利工程，只要两三年，穷山就可以变富山。李赋都说，在山区搞水土保持，在平原大力搞井灌，结合渠灌，河南人民的生活一定能年年提高。
    李赋都批评河南省领导方面对科学研究工作不够重视。他说，黄河的治理工作十分复杂，遇到的问题都是新问题，我们自己的水平低，依靠苏联专家帮助解决问题，但我们也不能永远依靠他们。黄委会对黄河的研究工作重视不够，研究工作远远落后于实际的需要。
    河南省水利厅副厅长李葆和指出：水利部门有两条路线，一条是搞小型水利工程的路线，一条是搞大型水利工程的路线。前者是党的路线，但占了下风。后者和党的路线相反，但占了上风。这是由于有关领导部门的教条主义造成的。接着，李葆和举出了许多事实，说明了水利工作领导上教条主义的严重性。他说，全省有一亿三千六百万亩地，水灾面积约为一千五百万到两千万亩，洪水灾害一般占30％到40％。以40％计算，洪水灾害面积最多不超过八百万亩，但颗粒不收的土地只有四百万亩。而教条主义者说，首先必须防治洪水，不治洪水什么也搞不成。于是，教条主义者用94％的人力和钱来防治洪水，而受洪水灾害的面积只占整个水灾面积的3％（似应为占整个耕地面积的3％——编者按），这就是用90％多的人力和钱去做3％的工作。在教条主义者的把持下，河南省几年来搞了五个大水库，修了几条大河道，但河道两边不挖支流，结果是“中间水一道，两边水汪汪”，越修越坏。
    在防涝方面，教条主义者说，只有修水库才能消灭涝灾，这就是“万般皆下品，唯有水库高”。李葆和说，根据他在永城县典型调查的结果，搞些小型水利工程，一亩地平均花一块钱到三块钱，就可以完全防治涝灾。
    在水土保持方面，山区占了一亿亩土地，需要搞水土保持，但这工作没有人重视。全省水利干部一万人，但水土保持工作编制的干部只有四十人，用的力量和钱都不相称。
    李葆和指出，在河南要增加农业生产，达到中央的增产指标，中心问题是搞好农田水利，就是要兴修小型水利工程，最重要的是打井下泉。但是这一工作不被重视，要搞农田水利没钱没人，一万个水利干部用到农田水利工作上的只有三十人，这太不相称了。教条主义者说，搞农田水利都不行，灌溉要引黄水，还要引长江水，这样要到第四个五年计划，要花三十多亿才能搞得成，这是舍近求远。这个计划实现以后，由于要修渠道，至少还要占去一个专区的土地。假如兴修小型水利工程，开展打井下泉工作，不但收效快，收效大，花钱少，而且可以少占甚至不占土地。
    根据上述事实，李葆和对过去的水利工程作了估价。他说：过去的水利工程和国民党时期相比，成绩是空前的，但是用共产党的要求来衡量则成绩不大，缺点很多。他希望通过整风把主观主义的领导作风和方法反掉。
    最后，李葆和提出了几点建议：
    第一，希望通过整风把“左”倾教条主义和右倾保守主义这种主观主义的领导作风和方法反掉，这不但是水利部门的事，而且也是有关部门如财政厅、银行、省计划委员会等部门的事；第二，加强调查研究，根据本省的特殊情况，制订全省的水利规划；第三，要进行科学实验和研究，如结合群众性的打井工作就可以研究出水文、地质的情况，还要大力训练水利技术人员，推广水利技术；第四，农业合作社也必须把灌溉纳入生产计划，实行包工制；第五，做好重点试验，树立水利工作的方向；第六，合理分配水利资金，合理使用干部；第七，加强对技术人员的政治思想教育。他说，假如技术人员学好了“实践论”和“矛盾论”，也就不会犯教条主义的错误了。
    李葆和提出，今后搞农田水利，国家只要在一亩地上投资一块钱，群众投资三块钱，就可以实现水利化和机械化了。他建议省委研究他所提出的建议和方法。
