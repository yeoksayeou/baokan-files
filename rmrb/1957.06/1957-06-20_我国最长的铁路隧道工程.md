Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th: The Liangfengya Tunnel project on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, China's longest railway tunnel, is under intensive construction.

The Liangfengya Tunnel is the throat of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The famous and perilous "Seventy-Two Bends" from Chongqing to Guiyang by car are located here. This tunnel is 4,243 meters long, equivalent to about 9 li. It is 2,000 meters longer than the Qinling Grand Tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

The railway tunnel project commenced on May 9th of this year. To date, the access channel for excavation at the tunnel entrance has been opened. Since the start of construction, the builders have been battling the complex geology, karst caves, and groundwater in this area. They have adopted the advanced Soviet parallel pilot tunnel excavation method for the first time in China's tunnel engineering.

Before the construction of this tunnel, engineering and technical personnel from the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways proposed more than a dozen excavation schemes. The tunnel currently under construction will save 12 million yuan in project costs compared to the original survey plan.

　　我国最长的铁路隧道工程
    新华社成都19日电　我国最长的一条铁路隧道——川黔铁路的凉风垭隧道工程，正在加紧施工。
    凉风垭隧道是川黔铁路的咽喉。从重庆乘汽车到贵阳经过的惊险闻名的“七十二拐”就在这里，这条隧道全长四千二百四十三公尺，约合九华里。比宝成铁路秦岭大隧道还长二千公尺。
    这条铁路隧道工程是在今年5月9日开工的。到现在隧道洞口的开挖通道已经打开。从开工以来，建设者们就一直同这里复杂的地质、溶洞和地下水作斗争。他们在我国隧道工程中，第一次采用了苏联先进的平行导坑开挖法。
    这条隧道在施工前，铁道部第二设计院的工程技术人员曾经先后提出了十多个开挖方案。现在已经施工的隧道，比原来勘测的方案要节省工程费用一千二百万元。
