　　What medicine is the United States selling?
　　People's Daily Commentator
    The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee negotiations in London are anticipated by the whole world, and the people of all countries are expecting that this time, a preliminary agreement can finally be reached on the urgent issue of disarmament. However, recent developments in the United States have aroused people's doubts again.
    Since the London talks began in mid-March, the Soviet Union has put forward specific proposals twice, striving to provide a new basis for reaching an agreement. Western countries have also shown some signs of conducting negotiations more seriously this time. On the issues of phased disarmament and the reduction of conventional military equipment quotas, on the implementation of certain supervision and inspection methods, and on the limited suspension of hydrogen bomb tests, the opinions of both sides have become much closer. Therefore, recently, international public opinion has widely speculated that the conditions for reaching some kind of agreement are ripe. In late May, when the US representative Stassen returned home for instructions, American newspapers and news agencies also released a lot of "optimistic" air, claiming that Stassen had been ordered to bring back a plan, preparing to reach some partial agreements.
    However, after Stassen returned to London, he never put the heavily publicized "new plan" to the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting for discussion, but took it to Paris to consult with the North Atlantic Group countries. Then he flew back to Washington again, where he stayed for a few days. At this time, the tone of American propaganda changed. On June 11, Dulles avoided directly stating the specific attitude of the United States towards the disarmament issue at a press conference, but emphasized the "difficulty" and "subtlety" of the issue, and said that there were "complicated procedural problems related to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization". The American propaganda machine followed suit, saying that some Western European countries did not approve of "rushing to reach an agreement with the Soviets" in order to avoid "falling into the Soviet propaganda trap". At the same time, news said that Stassen had been "reprimanded" by Dulles during his return to Washington, because he was said to have held a view that Dulles did not agree with, believing that the basis of any preliminary disarmament agreement mainly depended on the United States and the Soviet Union reaching a consensus, and "took excessive and hasty actions". The news also said that this time Dulles gave Stassen clear instructions, asking him to "adopt more diplomatic techniques", and before proposing any plan, he must "fully consult with Western European countries first". Dulles was still not at ease, and sent Stassen a "senior monitoring advisor" to provide "on-site guidance" for Stassen's negotiation activities.
    It seems that the United States is still playing a double game and delaying time on the issue of disarmament.
    The US government is in a dilemma on the issue of disarmament. On the one hand, it feels that the strong pressure at home and abroad to reach an agreement is irresistible, and it is not sure about the future of the nuclear arms race; but on the other hand, it is afraid that any progress in disarmament will lead to a relaxation of the international situation, which will be detrimental to the promotion of the US policy of strength. Within the US ruling group, differences have also arisen on how to deal with this situation. Under this situation, the US authorities adopted an ambiguous attitude. It is neither willing to reach an agreement quickly, nor dare to continue to carry out blatant obstruction. Therefore, on the one hand, it tries its best to pretend to sincerely seek a disarmament agreement, and puts forward various plans to take the initiative; on the other hand, it tries to avoid key issues as much as possible, and puts forward many unreasonable conditions, making it impossible to reach an agreement in practice. Now, it suddenly changes its usual arbitrary and independent attitude, and emphasizes respect for the opinions of Western European countries. This is obviously a tactic, trying to divert people's attention and use the excuse of "the need to consult with allies" to shirk its responsibility for delaying the negotiations. And when it has to consider some serious steps, it can also use this excuse to make these steps conform to the strategic interests of the United States as much as possible.
    However, after the United States stubbornly refused to reach any agreement on the issue of disarmament for a long time, it now has to resort to such an excuse, which also shows that the tricks it plays on the issue of disarmament cannot be played as they were. In the face of the unanimous demands of the people of the world and the constructive efforts of the Soviet Union, it is very difficult to continue to evade this issue. Therefore, everyone is willing to see what kind of medicine the US President's special envoy for disarmament issues can bring out of his gourd this time when he returns to London.

　　美国的葫芦里装的什么药？
　　本报评论员
    联合国裁军小组委员会在伦敦举行的谈判，为全世界所瞩望，各国公众都在期待这一次终于能在裁军这个迫切的问题上，得到初步的协议。但是，最近美国的一些动态，却又引起了人们的怀疑。
    伦敦谈判从3月中开始以来，苏联曾先后两次提出了具体的建议，努力提供取得协议的新基础。西方国家这次也有了一些看来比较认真地进行谈判的表现。在有关分阶段实现裁军和裁减常规军备限额的问题上，在实行某种监督和视察的办法的问题上，以及在限期中止氢弹试验等问题上，双方的意见已有了不少接近之处。因此，最近国际舆论广泛猜测，达成某种协议的条件是成熟了。5月下旬，在美国代表史塔生回国请示的时候，美国报纸和通讯社还放出许多“乐观”空气，扬言史塔生已受命带回一项方案，准备达成一些局部的协议。
    但是，史塔生回到伦敦之后，却一直没有把这个大加宣传的“新方案”，提到裁军小组委员会会议上讨论，而是把它带到巴黎去同北大西洋集团国家磋商。随后他又再度飞回华盛顿，在那里滞留了几天。在这个时候，美国的宣传调子有了改变。6月11日，杜勒斯在记者招待会上避免正面说明美国对裁军问题的具体态度，而强调这个问题的“困难”和“微妙性”，并说产生了什么“和北大西洋公约组织有关的程序方面的复杂问题”。美国宣传机关随风起浪，说是某些西欧国家不赞成“急于和苏联人达成协议”，以免“陷入苏联的宣传圈套”。同时有消息说，史塔生这次返华盛顿，已受到了杜勒斯的“申斥”，因为他据说抱有一种杜勒斯不同意的看法，认为任何初步裁军协议的基础主要取决于美苏两国求得一致意见，并且“采取了过火和过急的行动”。消息还说，这一次杜勒斯给史塔生作了明确的指示，要他“采取更多的外交手法”，并在提出任何方案以前，一定要“先同西欧国家充分协商”。杜勒斯还不放心，又给史塔生派了一个“高级监视顾问”，以便对史塔生的谈判活动进行“现场指导”。
    看来，美国在裁军问题上，直到现在还在耍两面手法，拖延时间。
    美国政府在裁军问题上是处在一种两难的境地。一方面，它感到国内外要求达成协议的强大压力难以抗拒，而且对于核子军备竞赛的前途也并无把握；但另一方面又害怕在裁军方面的任何进展会导致国际局势的缓和，从而不利于美国实力政策的推行。美国统治集团内部在应该如何应付这种局面的问题上，也发生了分歧。在这种形势下，美国当局采取了一种暖昧的态度。它既不愿迅速达成协议，又不敢继续进行露骨的阻挠。因此，它一方面竭力装作真诚地谋求裁军协议的样子，提出各种各样的方案，以争取主动，另一方面又尽量规避关键的问题，提出许多不合理的条件，使得实际上无法达成协议。现在，它忽然改变惯常专断独行的态度，而强调尊重西欧国家的意见。这显然是一种策略，想转移人们的视线，用“需要同盟国磋商”这个口实，来推托它使谈判继续拖延的责任。而在不得不考虑某些认真的步骤时，也可以利用这个借口，来使得这种步骤尽可能符合美国的战略利益。
    但是，美国在长时期顽固地拒绝就裁军问题达成任何协议之后，现在不得不诉诸于这样一种借口，这也说明它在裁军问题上玩的把戏要按原样子玩下去是不行了。在全世界人民一致的要求和苏联建设性的努力面前，要继续规避这个问题是很困难了。因此，大家都愿意看看，美国总统谈判裁军问题的特使这次再回到伦敦以后，从他葫芦里究竟能够拿出些什么药来。
