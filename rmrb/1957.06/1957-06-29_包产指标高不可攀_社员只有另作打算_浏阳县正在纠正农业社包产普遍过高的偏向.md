　　High Quotas Impractical, Commune Members Make Other Plans
    Liuyang County Correcting the Tendency of Excessively High Production Quotas in Agricultural Cooperatives

    This newspaper reports that the Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province is correcting the tendency of excessively high production quotas in the "Three Guarantees" (guarantee of labor, guarantee of production, and guarantee of cost) system in agricultural cooperatives.

    This year, the agricultural cooperatives in Liuyang County have implemented the "Three Guarantees" and a system of rewards for exceeding production targets. However, most cooperatives set production quotas that were too high, with some even exceeding normal yields by 60%. Cooperative cadres subjectively believed that the higher the production quota, the greater the production enthusiasm of the members. The opposite was true: members had no confidence in completing such unattainable production quotas and saw no hope of receiving rewards for exceeding them. As a result, some members focused on their private plots, while others sought personal side hustles, and were not active in cooperative production.

    After transplanting rice seedlings, the Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly asked each cooperative to lower the excessively high production quotas to the level of normal yields, so that each member would be confident of completing the production quota and could strive to receive rewards for exceeding it. By mid-June, 441 cooperatives in the county had made appropriate adjustments to their production quotas, with remarkable results. The Lianxin Cooperative reduced its production quota from 1,202 jin per mu to 760 jin (last year's actual yield was 782 jin per mu), and made corresponding revisions to the cost, work point, and reward methods. The members were very satisfied. Members of each team tried every means to increase production. Members of the third team collected more than 2,400 dan of fertilizer and applied it to 56 mu of rice paddies where the seedlings were not growing well, in an effort to achieve a good harvest.

    However, there are still 403 cooperatives in Liuyang County that have not lowered their excessively high production quotas. The main reason is that cooperative cadres still have various ideological concerns. Some are afraid that lowering the quotas will lead to a spontaneous flow in production; others fear that if the team receives more rewards, it will not be able to complete the task of unified grain purchase; some are afraid that if this is done, members will compete to work, and the number of workers will increase, and the value of work points will decrease, which will affect their income; and some are afraid of the trouble. Now, the Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has explored specific ways to solve these ideological obstacles in key cooperatives, and plans to lower the excessively high production quotas of these 400-plus cooperatives before the early rice harvest, so that the broad masses of members can fully play their production enthusiasm in cultivating late rice and planting late autumn crops.

### 包产指标高不可攀　社员只有另作打算  浏阳县正在纠正农业社包产普遍过高的偏向

　　包产指标高不可攀　社员只有另作打算
    浏阳县正在纠正农业社包产普遍过高的偏向
    本报讯　中共湖南省浏阳县委正在纠正农业社“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）中包产指标过高的偏向。
    浏阳县的农业社今年都实行“三包”和超产奖励制度，但大部分社产量指标订得过高，有一部分社甚至高到超过常年产量60％。社干部主观地认为包产指标订得越高，社员的生产劲头就越大。事实恰恰相反，社员对于这样高不可攀的包产指标，都没有信心完成，更没有得到超产奖励的希望。因此，有的社员就着重搞自己的自留地，有的找个人的副业门路，对社里生产不积极。
    中共浏阳县委在插秧后曾一再要求各社把过高的包产指标降低到常年产量的水平，使每个社员有把握完成包产指标，并可以争取得到超产奖励。到6月中旬，全县已有四百四十一个社，把包产指标作了适当的调整，并收到了显著效果。莲新社把包产指标由每亩一千二百零二斤降低到七百六十斤（去年每亩实产七百八十二斤），成本、工分和超产奖励办法也作了相应的修改以后，社员十分满意。各队社员都想方设法，努力增产。第三队社员搜集了二千四百多担肥料，下到禾苗生长不好的五十六亩稻田里，争取丰收。
    但是，现在浏阳县还有四百零三个社没有把过高的包产指标降低下来。主要原因是社干部思想上还有各种顾虑。有的人怕降低指标，生产形成自流；有的人怕队里得到奖励多，会完不成粮食统购任务；有的怕这样一搞，社员争着出工，做工的人多，分值降低，会影响自己的收入；有的人怕麻烦。现在，中共浏阳县委会已在重点社中摸索到解决这些思想障碍的具体办法，计划在早稻收割以前，把这四百多个社过高的包产指标降下来，使广大社员在培育晚稻和种植晚秋作物中充分地发挥生产积极性。
