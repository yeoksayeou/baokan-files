The Social Order of Monkeys
Tan Bangjie

In Comrade Wu Zuguang's travelogue of Mount Emei (Traveler Magazine, March issue), he told many interesting stories about the monkey troops of Mount Emei. In particular, there was a passage about a platoon leader treating the monkey king in the manner of dealing with a despotic landlord, which led to "the tree falling and the monkeys scattering." Several comrades have asked for my opinion on whether this matter was handled correctly.

I am reminded of a similar story. In the monkey mountain of the Rome Zoo, the old monkey king died, and a large monkey that had long been eager to try took over as the new monkey king. When the old monkey king was still alive, it had some scruples, but now it showed unparalleled brutality, not only frightening the monkeys day and night, but also not allowing them to eat their fill. Although it was already full to bursting, it still wouldn't let others eat, but gathered all the food on the ground into a large pile, sat on it, and felt complacent! A monkey king like this only needs to be caught and confined alone. But unfortunately, this monkey was particularly cunning and could not be caught no matter what, so in the end, they had to shoot it down from the highest branch when it was resting.

The zoo cannot allow the monkey king to be too brutal in order to take care of the peace of the monkey mountain and the health of all the monkeys, which is understandable. But should the monkey troops on Mount Emei also follow this example? I think not. The monkeys there are wild (or at least semi-wild). To measure the monkey society with the moral standards of human society, no matter how sincere and selfless the intention is, I am afraid that it cannot get rid of the label of subjectivism.

However, the old monk's defense of the monkey king is also somewhat "judging the heart of a monkey with the heart of a gentleman," which is also unreliable. Those familiar with monkey habits know that the monkey king does not allow the little monkeys to come forward to grab food, certainly not because it is afraid that they will be caught. After returning "home," it is also impossible to spit out the food stored in its cheek pouches (the so-called pockets under the neck) to feed it. Not only will the monkey king (male) never do this, but even the female monkey is not so generous to her own offspring. Monkey keepers can prove that when delicious food is present, the female monkey only cares about stuffing it into her own cheek pouches, sometimes even slapping the little monkey a few times, making it squeak because it grabs too much.

All the monkeys in the world have originally grown up under such a social order. There is no such thing as morality or humility here. The most important (and most basic) thing is how to develop the best way to make a living from an early age. On the contrary, if the little monkey learns a set of virtues of mutual humility from an early age, it may not be a blessing, and it is likely to fall into the ranks of natural selection.

Professor Zuckerman wrote a fascinating book, "The Social Life of Monkeys and Apes," based on years of observation of monkey life at the London Zoo. This book is not only of reference value to ecologists, but also provides a wealth of interesting insights for the general reader. The book also provides us with rich information about the social order of monkeys.

In zoos, people can often find monkeys "catching lice" for each other. But how can there be so many lice! This is just a scene of social interaction. Originally, under the long fur of the monkeys, on the skin, there are often crystals of secretions, slightly salty, which the monkeys find and chew in their mouths, probably a bit like us chewing melon seeds. But its significance is more than that. There is also the role of social interaction. When two monkeys have nothing to do, they get together to "catch lice." This is often the "lower-ranking" one catching lice for the "higher-ranking" one, especially for the monkey king, which is obviously to curry favor. Conversely, the monkey king or higher-ranking monkeys also have times when they "catch lice" for monkey subjects and little monkeys, which has the meaning of showing favor.

In our society, when two people meet, one turns his back to the other, which is considered a great disrespect, but in monkey society, facing with the buttocks is precisely a sign of friendship. Also, baring teeth is considered goodwill, but if it looks at you and nods, you have to be careful, it is preparing to pounce.

It can be seen that subjective imagination is always inconsistent with objective facts. Although we belong to the same order (Primates), we are ultimately of different families. Although we are more or less similar in appearance, what we think in our hearts is very different. Customs and habits, needless to say, are still not well understood. Based only on one's own opinion, even the laws in our human society may not be judged accurately, let alone the social order of monkeys! (Attached picture)

    猴子的社会秩序
    谭邦杰
    吴祖光同志在一篇峨眉山记游的文章（旅行家杂志3月号）里，讲了许多有关峨眉山的猴群的故事，很使人发生兴趣；尤其是有一段关于一位排长用对待恶霸地主的方式对待了猴王，以致从此“树倒猢狲散”。关于这件事办得对不对，颇有几位同志愿征求我的意见。
    我想起一件类似的故事。在罗马动物园的猴山里，老猴王死去了，久已跃跃欲试的一只大猴子继任为新猴王。当老猴王仍在世时，它还有所顾忌，现在却显示出无比的残暴，不但吓得群猴日夜惶惶，而且还不许它们吃饱。它自己虽已饱得无可再饱，但还不让别只吃，却把地上所有的食物集拢成一大堆，自己一屁股坐上去，怡然自得！像这样的猴王，只要设法把它捉出，单独禁闭，也就是了。但不幸的是：这只猴特别狡猾，怎么也捉它不住，最后只得乘它歇在最高枝上的时候，一枪将它打下。
    动物园为了照顾猴山的安宁和全体猴子的健康，不能容许猴王过于残暴，这是可以理解的。可是如峨眉山上的猴群是否也应援例呢？我想是不可的。那里的猴群是野生的（或至少也算是半野生的）。以人类社会的道德尺度来衡量猴子的社会，无论其本意是多么真诚无私，恐怕也脱不掉主观主义的帽子吧。
    但是老和尚为猴王开脱的话也是有点“以君子之心度猴子之腹”，同样是靠不住的。熟悉猴子习性的人都知道，猴王不让小猴上前抢食，决不是怕它被人捉去。回到“家”中后，也决不可能把装在颊囊（就是所谓脖子底下的口袋）里的食物再吐出来喂它。不但猴王（公的）决不会这样做，甚至母猴对自己的亲生仔也没有这样大方。管猴的人可以证明：遇到美食当前，母猴也只顾拼命往自己的颊囊里装，有时甚至打小猴几记耳光，把它打得唧唧乱叫，因为它抢得太过火了。
    普天下的猴子原来都是在这样的一种社会秩序之下教育成长的。这里没有什么所谓道德或谦让一类的说法，最重要的（也是最基本的）只是如何从小练出一身最好的谋生之道而已。相反的，倘若小猴自幼学的是一套互相谦让的美德，那却未必是福，很可能要落在自然淘汰之行列的。
    苏克曼教授根据伦敦动物园猴群生活的多年观察写出了一本富有趣味的“猿猴类的社交生活”，这本书，不但对生态学家具有参考价值，就是一般人读了也会得到大量有趣的启发。书里也向我们提供了有关猴子的社会秩序的丰富资料。
    在动物园里，人们经常可以发现猴子在互相“捉虱子”。其实哪里有那么多的虱子！这也不过是社交的一幕吧了。原来在猴子的长毛下面，在皮肤上常常附着一些分泌物的结晶粒，略带咸味，猴子们找出来放入口中嚼嚼，大概有点像我们嚼瓜子的意思。但其意义尚不止此。其中还有着社交的作用。两只猴子闲来无事，凑在一起就“捉虱子”，这往往是“位分低的”给“位分高的”捉，尤其是替猴王捉，显然是有着巴结的意思。反之，猴王或位分高的猴子也有给猴臣及小猴子“捉虱子”的时候，这却有着示宠的意味在内。
    在我们的社会里，二人相逢，一人向他人以背，这是被认为大不敬的事，但是在猴子社会里，以屁股相向却正是亲善的表示。还有呲牙咧嘴也算是好意，但若是向你注目点头，你可要当心，那是准备要扑过来了。
    由此可见，主观的想像，总常常是与客观的事实不符的。我们和它们虽然谊属同目（灵长目），但究竟还不同科；在长像方面虽然也或多或少有点相似，但心里想的却大相径庭，风俗习惯，更不用说，了解得还很不够。只凭一己之见，连我们人的社会中的规律还未必判断得准确，何况是猴类的社会秩序哩！（附图片）
