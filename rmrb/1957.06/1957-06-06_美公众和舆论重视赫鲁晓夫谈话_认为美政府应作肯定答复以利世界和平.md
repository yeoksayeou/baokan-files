Xinhua News Agency, June 5th dispatch from New York: The American public is paying great attention to Khrushchev's interview with "Columbia Broadcasting System" reporters in Moscow, and many American newspapers have published comments on this speech.

The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union George Kennan on June 4th, stating that the United States "should seriously consider some parts of this television interview." Kennan said that "some of what Khrushchev said is very correct and indeed sincere." He believes that "other things, while not entirely correct, are equally sincere."

Kennan expressed concern that the United States may fail to "give due attention to those parts of Khrushchev's speech that reflect a very real and hopeful prospect." He said that we have a responsibility to study the issues raised by Khrushchev very objectively. Our excessive suspicion may cause a lot of harm. He said: "I think we should calmly and carefully consider Mr. Khrushchev's speech, without illusions, prejudice, or timidity. ... There may indeed be some real possibility hidden within it for improving world peace."

"New York Times" television commentator Gold pointed out that "for ordinary Americans, this broadcast was a moment of inspiring revelation." He called for a "wise and positive response" to Khrushchev's proposals, "rather than blindly opposing them."

"New York Post" commentator M. Lerner commented that the interview was "a very good television broadcast, a very good political activity, and it achieved success." He particularly pointed out that Khrushchev's speech was a direct and frank conversation with "the broad American audience."

Lerner predicted that this direct contact would have a profound impact on future international relations and would bankrupt the current monotonous American propaganda. He expressed the hope that Eisenhower would also "issue such a frank and meaningful statement."

Lerner concluded: "Khrushchev's proposal to ban experimental explosions is undoubtedly a concrete step towards disarmament, which we should welcome."

"Christian Science Monitor" Washington diplomatic commentator Stanford said that Khrushchev's speech "impressed senior US officials and made them somewhat worried." They "are afraid of the significance of Khrushchev's proposal for 'small and limited disarmament steps'." He said, "Washington welcomes Moscow's clear expression of willingness to disarm gradually without suggesting a comprehensive agreement. However, the United States is not interested if this means the withdrawal of US armed forces from West Germany and Western Europe and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe."

"New York Post" reporter Rashi pointed out that "Khrushchev's flexible attitude towards the simultaneous withdrawal of both sides from Central Europe has become the focus of attention in diplomatic circles. Many American experts believe that the withdrawal of troops is the main key to resolving the European issue. The State Department is trying to prevent public discussion of the issue of jointly withdrawing armed forces, at least until after the West German elections in September." The reporter also specifically pointed out that Khrushchev "emphasized the Soviet Union's desire for trade" in his speech.

The Philadelphia "Inquirer" believes that Khrushchev's speech is an extremely important event. It is convinced that from the perspective of American national interests and the interests of the capitalist world, "the possibility of the first step on the road to disarmament" is worth trying. The newspaper concluded: "Khrushchev's televised broadcast helped with this."

"The Washington Post and Times Herald" reported that US House Speaker Rayburn said in a comment on Khrushchev's speech that he hoped that the United States and the Soviet Union could one day reach an agreement on stopping hydrogen bomb tests.

California residents Sterling and Mott Smith sent a telegram to Khrushchev after listening to his television interview. The telegram said: We are very happy to see you on television. This discussion in front of the American people is a great contribution to mutual understanding and world peace.

A man named Jacoby also telegraphed Khrushchev, saying, I like your sincerity and the same views as our dear President Eisenhower. I believe that the two of you can promote the establishment of world peace. For the sake of peace, I would like to see you.

### 美公众和舆论重视赫鲁晓夫谈话  认为美政府应作肯定答复以利世界和平

    美公众和舆论重视赫鲁晓夫谈话
    认为美政府应作肯定答复以利世界和平
    据新华社5日讯　纽约消息：美国公众非常重视赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科对“哥伦比亚广播公司”记者的谈话，美国许多报纸都发表了对这篇谈话的评论。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”6月4日刊载美国前驻苏联大使乔治·凯南所写的文章，认为美国“应该认真考虑这篇电视谈话中的某些部分”。凯南说，赫鲁晓夫谈话中“有一些是十分正确的，而且也的确是由衷之谈”。他认为，“另外一些话固然不完全正确，但是也同样是由衷之谈。”
    凯南表示担心美国不能够对赫鲁晓夫所说的“反映着十分真实而且令人寄与希望的前景的那几段话给予应有的重视”。他说，我们有责任极其客观地对赫鲁晓夫所谈到的一些问题加以研究。我们的过分狐疑，可能会招致很多害处。他说：“我认为，我们应当冷静地仔细考虑赫鲁晓夫先生的谈话，既不抱幻想，也不抱偏见或畏缩。……那里面也许的确潜藏着改善世界和平的机会的某种真正的可能性。”
    “纽约时报”电视评论员戈尔德指出，“对普通美国人来说，这次广播是令人振奋的启示的时刻”。他要求对赫鲁晓夫的建议作“明智和肯定的答复，而不要盲目地加以反对。”
    “纽约邮报”评论员马·勒纳发表评论说，这次谈话是“很好的电视广播节目，是很好的政治活动，并且获得了成就。”他特别指出赫鲁晓夫的谈话是同“美国广大听众”直接坦率的谈话。
    勒纳预言，这种直接的接触将对未来的国际关系产生深远的影响，并且使现在美国千篇一律的宣传破产了。他表示希望艾森豪威尔也“发表这样坦率和意义深长的声明”。
    勒纳最后说：“赫鲁晓夫现在提出禁止试验性爆炸的建议，这毫无疑问是走向裁军的一个具体步骤，这是我们应当欢迎的”。
    “基督教科学箴言报”华盛顿外交评论员史坦福说，赫鲁晓夫的谈话“给美国高级官员留下了印象，并且在某种程度上使他们感到担心”。他们“害怕赫鲁晓夫关于‘小小而有限的裁军步骤’这一提法的意义”。他说，“莫斯科明显地表示愿意逐步裁军，而没有建议签订包罗万象的协定，这受到华盛顿的欢迎。但是，如果这意味着美国武装部队从西德和西欧撤出，苏联军队从东欧撤出，美国是不感兴趣的”。
    “纽约邮报”记者拉希指出，“赫鲁晓夫对于东西双方同时撤出欧洲中部的主张所持的灵活态度，已经成为外交界的注意中心。许多美国专家认为，撤军是使欧洲问题得到解决的主要关键。国务院企图阻碍公开讨论共同撤退武装部队的问题，最低限度也得到9月西德举行大选以后。这位记者还特别指出：赫鲁晓夫在他的谈话中“强调了苏联对贸易的愿望”。
    费城“问询”报认为赫鲁晓夫的谈话是一个极其重要的事件。它深信，从美国民族利益和资本主义世界利益的观点来看，“裁军路上第一步的可能性”是值得尝试一下的。这家报纸最后说：“赫鲁晓夫的电视广播谈话对这一点是有所帮助的”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”报道，美国众议院议长雷朋在评论赫鲁晓夫的谈话时说，他希望美国和苏联总有一天能就停止试验氢弹问题达成协议。
    加利福尼亚州洛杉矶市市民斯特朗和莫特史密斯在听了赫鲁晓夫的电视谈话后，给赫鲁晓夫发了一封电报，电报说，我们很高兴在电视中看到您。在美国人民面前的这次讨论对互相了解和对世界和平是一个巨大贡献。
    一个叫雅各比的也给赫鲁晓夫发电报说，我很喜欢您的真诚以及和我们亲爱的艾森豪威尔总统相同的见解。我相信，你们两人是能够促进世界和平的建立的。为了和平，我很想见到您。
