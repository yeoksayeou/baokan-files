　　Xi'an, June 9th (Our Newspaper) - Cheng Boren, Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province and Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, told reporters today that since the "Great Blooming and Letting Contend," many remarks have deviated from socialism, and these remarks are extremely wrong. For example, some people have proposed abolishing the Party committee system in schools, some capitalist representatives have proposed withdrawing public representatives from joint state-private enterprises, and a few days ago, Comrade Chu Anping put forward the argument of "the Party's world." Some people at Northwest University have even said that during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, Marxism-Leninism cannot be used as a guiding ideology, and so on. They should be told that these are words and deeds that violate the current constitution and do not conform to the actual facts in various parts of the country.

　　Since September 20, 1954, when the First National People's Congress passed the current constitution at its first session, 600 million people, under the leadership of the Party, have resolutely embarked on the road of building socialism. This is the unwavering law and fact today. In the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, one cannot deviate from this principle in the slightest. Comrade Chu Anping, as a representative of the National People's Congress, when he raised his hand to pass the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, did he think about the fact that the people of the whole country are taking the socialist road, and who will lead them on the socialist road? Moreover, what is the basis for his so-called "the Party's world" argument? Where did he see the fact of "the Party's world"? This is speaking with his eyes closed. Taking the facts of the organizational forms of governments at all levels, from the central ministries to the provinces (cities), counties, and down to the grassroots (township people's committees), its organizational forms and leading cadres are basically of a united front nature, with Party and non-Party personnel working side by side.

　　Of course, it cannot be denied that in governments at all levels and in various departments, there are still situations where non-Party cadres have positions but no power. Therefore, the Party is making the greatest determination to carry out rectification within the Party, and is encouraging and requiring non-Party people to speak out, expose the facts, and overcome shortcomings and mistakes.

　　Vice Governor Cheng Boren also said that what Ge Peiqi of Renmin University said, comparing the people's support for the Communist Party to the change of emperors in past feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionary government, is a distorted analogy. Ge Peiqi also said, "Even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people would not sell out the country." Who is this "people" referring to? What guarantee do you have that people will not sell out the country? Please recall history and it will be clear. Who signed the past treaties of national betrayal, and who sold out our country's territorial sovereignty to the enemy? To be honest, it was precisely because there was no Communist Party at the time, or the Communist Party's strength was still very weak, that so many unequal treaties and so many ugly facts of national betrayal were produced in history. What is even more hateful is that the phenomenon of writing anonymous threatening letters has emerged in the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, which is the same as the methods used by Kuomintang secret agents in the past. However, this is also beneficial to our people across the country, because it can educate the people not to fall asleep, but to be vigilant, because there are still remnants of counter-revolutionaries active!

　　Vice Governor Cheng questioned the People's Daily and other newspapers, saying: These erroneous arguments are becoming more and more numerous. Why don't newspapers argue and criticize these erroneous things? Everyone has the right to speak out in the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, but everyone also has the right to contend. I think a major shortcoming in the past was that there was only speaking out and no contending, and this shortcoming was most evident in the newspapers. The Party newspaper may have its difficulties in this regard. For example, I heard that if the Party newspaper adds a note to different opinions, some people will say that "the Party newspaper is not bold enough in implementing the policy of blooming and letting contend," and "the Party newspaper is taking it back again," etc. In fact, this is also a one-sided statement. The fact is not like this, so there should be no concerns. The interests of the country should be the priority. If those words and deeds that deviate from socialism and are detrimental to the country are not debated and criticized in a timely manner, it will not be possible to distinguish right from wrong, it will not be possible to educate cadres and the masses, it will blur the awareness of the masses, and the interests of the country will inevitably be damaged.

### 民盟陕西省委副主任委员成柏仁  主张要鸣要争要分辩是非

　　主张要鸣要争要分辩是非
    本报西安9日电  陕西省副省长、民盟陕西省委副主任委员成柏仁今天对记者说，从“大鸣大放”以来，出现了很多离开社会主义的言论，这些言论是极端错误的。譬如，有人提出要取消学校的党委制，有的资方代表提出要在公私合营企业里撤出公方代表，前几天，储安平同志又提出“党天下”的论调。西北大学还有人说在百家争鸣时期，马克思列宁主义不能作为指导思想等等。应该告诉他们，这是违反现行宪法的言行，也不符合全国各地实际的事实。
    我们国家自从1954年9月20日，在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上通过现行宪法以来，六亿人民在党的领导下，坚决走上建立社会主义的道路。这是今天确定不移的法律和事实。在大鸣大放中，丝毫也不能离开这一条原则。储安平同志，是全国人民代表大会的代表，在当时举手通过中华人民共和国宪法时，是否想到全国人民走社会主义道路，谁来领导走社会主义道路？而且，他的所谓“党天下”的论点，根据是什么？他从什么地方看到“党天下”这个事实，这是闭着眼睛说话。拿各级政权组织形式的事实来说，从中央各部到省（市）、县，一直到基层（乡人民委员会），它的组织形式和领导干部，基本上都是统一战线联合性质的，党和非党人员都并肩共事。
    当然，不能否认，在各级政府中，在各个部门中，还存在着非党干部有职无权的情况，因此，党才下最大决心，在党内进行整风，才鼓励、要求非党人士大鸣大放，揭露事实，克服缺点和错误。
    成柏仁副省长又说，像人民大学的葛佩琦所说的，把人民拥护共产党和过去封建王朝改朝换帝、和国民党反动派政府来比，这是非驴非马的歪曲。葛佩琦又说“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”这个人家是指的谁？你有什么保证人家不卖国，请你回忆一下历史就清楚了。过去的那些卖国条约是谁订的，是谁把我们国家的领土主权卖给敌人的？老实说，正因当时没有个共产党或共产党力量还很薄弱，所以才产生了历史上许许多多的不平等条约，许许多多丑恶的卖国事实。更可恨的是，竟然在大鸣大放中出现了写匿名恐吓信的现象，这是和过去国民党特务分子的作法是一样的。不过，这对我们全国人民来说也有好处，可以教育人民不要睡大觉，要提高警惕，因为还有反革命残余在活动吧！
    成副省长质问人民日报和其它报纸说：这些错误的论调，越来越多了，报纸为什么不对这些错误的东西进行争论和批判呢？百家争鸣，谁都有权利鸣，但是，谁也都有权利争。我认为过去一个很大的缺点，就是只有鸣而没有争，而这个缺点最明显地表现在报纸上。党报可能在这方面有他的难处，如听说党报对不同的意见加个按语，就有人说“党报执行鸣放方针不够大胆”，“党报又在收了”等，其实这也是一面之词。事实上并不是这样，因此，就不应该有什么顾虑，应该以国家利益为重，对那些脱离社会主义对国家不利的言行，如果不及时争论批判，就不能明辨是非，就不能教育干部和群众，就会使群众意识模糊，而国家利益也就不可避免的要受到损失。
