Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporters learned from the Ministry of Internal Affairs: The Huai River basin and parts of North China, which suffered disasters last year, have generally had a good wheat harvest this year. The areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province and Huaiyin area in Jiangsu Province, which suffered the most last year, have achieved bumper harvests. Now wheat is being harvested in disaster areas, and famine can be basically overcome after the summer harvest.

Last year during the wheat harvest, vast areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan suffered from flooding. Then, a strong typhoon landing from Zhejiang swept through the area again, causing another round of rainstorms and waterlogging. The Songhua River in Northeast China and the Hai River basin in Hebei Province also experienced major floods. Parts of Hunan and Guangxi provinces also suffered from drought. As a result, the national disaster area last year exceeded that of 1954, and the lives of the vast number of disaster victims were difficult. Fortunately, these areas had basically achieved agricultural cooperativization last year. With the support of the state, disaster victims relied on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives for production and self-salvation, and smoothly passed the famine days of last winter and this spring.

State allocations and grain relief played a major supporting role in the production and famine relief of the people in the disaster areas. From the time of the disaster last year to the present, the state has successively allocated a total of 379,750,000 yuan in relief funds to the disaster areas, and increased loans to seven provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, reaching 318,100,000 yuan; more than 7.9 billion jin of grain was transferred. In addition, there were a large number of work-for-relief funds, local specialty procurement funds, agricultural product pre-purchase funds, as well as exemptions and reductions of public grain. The huge material support enabled many villages destroyed by floods to rebuild their homes with the support of the government. In particular, it boosted the confidence of farmers in disaster areas to resist disasters.

In the large-scale production and self-salvation movement carried out in the disaster areas, agricultural cooperatives demonstrated unparalleled superiority. Hebei Province drained water and planted wheat simultaneously, rushing to plant more than 38 million mu of wheat more than ten days earlier than in previous years, exceeding the highest wheat planting area in history. Under the slogan of "competing with water for land," agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of Henan Province drained water and replanted again and again, planting a total of 7.53 million mu of various late autumn crops, harvesting 220 million jin of grain, 300 million jin of sweet potatoes, and 8.2 billion jin of vegetables, greatly strengthening the ability of disaster victims to survive the famine. Last winter and this spring, the income from sideline production in Henan Province reached 100.3 million yuan, and 30% of the disaster victims relied on sideline income to overcome their living difficulties. In Huaiyin Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, due to the good development of sideline production, not only did the number of pigs in pens this spring not decrease, but also increased by more than 130,000 compared with the same period last year. Farmers in disaster areas generally reflected: With cooperation, there is nothing to fear.

In order to solve the difficulties of disaster victims, in addition to mobilizing mutual assistance and mutual support between cooperatives and cooperatives, and between members and members, the governments of various places, and the people of cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and provinces and regions such as Liaoning, Shanxi, Shandong, Hubei, and Inner Mongolia, also launched a campaign to donate winter clothing to support disaster victims through the winter. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.48 million pieces of winter clothing and more than 1.51 million yuan in cash, and 700,000 jin of grain were donated. Some provinces and cities also sent medical teams to the disaster areas, and the People's Army also provided material support to the disaster areas. With the support of all parties, the problems of clothing, food, housing, and medical treatment of the people in the disaster areas have been properly resolved. Many disaster victims gratefully said: The Communist Party and the People's Government are closer than our own parents.

The cadres at all levels in the disaster-stricken areas shared weal and woe with the disaster victims, actively leading them to fight disasters and survive the famine, and won the praise of the broad masses of the people in the disaster areas. The secretaries of the provincial party committees and governors of Henan and Anhui provinces, as well as the responsible cadres of various departments, successively led working groups to go deep into the disaster areas to understand the disaster situation and help the disaster victims formulate plans for production and disaster relief. During the rain and snow and severe cold, Anhui Province alone sent more than 1,500 cadres to the countryside in Fuyang Prefecture to check the disaster relief work, ensuring that the problems in the disaster areas were resolved in a timely manner. Cadres from Fudong No. 15 Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County discovered that 24 "five-guarantee households" were short of firewood, so they personally braved the rain and snow to carry more than 3,000 jin of coal from seven miles away for them. Before the Spring Festival, Huaiyin Prefecture in Jiangsu Province organized more than 10,000 cadres to go to various places to investigate disasters and provide emergency relief. More than 180 district and township cadres in Lireng District, Siyang County, braved the snow to deliver grain and grass to farmers. Four female cadres from Laozi Mountain Town in Hongze County sewed relief cotton-padded clothes for a blind old lady in her seventies overnight. The old lady was so moved that she shed tears and said, "The cadres led by Chairman Mao are really good." In addition to paying attention to overcoming the current difficulties in life, the cadres in the disaster areas also actively came up with ideas and methods to strengthen production work, and tried to shorten the famine period and alleviate the disaster in many ways.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said that last year's natural disasters were rare in China's history, and were greater than those in 1954 and even greater than the floods in 1931. The victory of the people in the disaster areas in overcoming this huge disaster once again proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system under the leadership of the Communist Party. Under the attack of such a large disaster, except for a few lightly affected areas where insufficient attention was paid to disaster relief work, and there were blind inflows of disaster victims into cities, and serious deaths due to disasters in individual areas of Guangxi Province due to cadre bureaucracy, the disaster victims in severely affected areas were basically able to live and work in peace and contentment. Judging from the overall situation, now that wheat is being harvested in the disaster areas, the disaster victims have eaten new grain, and the spring famine has passed. However, there are still some areas where the winter wheat sowing was rough and there was a spring drought, resulting in poor harvests, and a small number of disaster areas did not plant much wheat, so the lives of the disaster victims will still have some difficulties after the summer harvest. New disasters are also prone to occur at present. The leading departments in various places have paid great attention to this. Anhui Province has held a disaster prevention conference, specifically arranging the work of preventing natural disasters this year. Henan Province issued instructions to do a good job in the summer famine, requiring all localities to prevent complacency, conscientiously do a good job in summer requisition reduction, do a good job in agricultural and sideline production, and vigorously develop the breeding industry in perennially disaster-stricken areas to achieve one pig per household.

### 党和政府的关怀和援助鼓舞了灾区人民生产自救的热情　战胜巨大灾害  顺利度过春荒

　　党和政府的关怀和援助鼓舞了灾区人民生产自救的热情
　　战胜巨大灾害  顺利度过春荒
　　让右派分子听听灾区人民的肺腑之言：“有了合作社，什么都不怕！”“共产党和人民政府比爹娘还亲！”“毛主席领导的干部真好！”
    新华社19日讯　新华社记者从内务部获悉：去年受灾的淮河流域和华北部分地区，今年小麦一般收成较好，去年受灾较重的安徽省淮河两岸和江苏省淮阴地区都获得丰收。现在灾区小麦普遍登场，夏收后可以基本战胜灾荒。
    去年麦收时，江苏、安徽、河南广大地区都遭受了涝灾，接着由浙江登陆的强台风又扫过这个地区，再次形成暴雨和内涝的灾害，东北松花江和河北省海河流域也有大水灾，湖南和广西两省还有部分地区受旱；从而使去年的全国受灾面积超过了1954年，广大灾民生活困难。幸而这些地区去年都已基本上实现了农业合作化，灾民在国家的扶持下，依靠农业社的集体力量生产自救，才顺利地度过了去冬今春的饥荒日子。
    国家拨款、拨粮救济，对灾区人民生产度荒起了主要的支持作用。从去年受灾到现在，国家先后给灾区拨下的救济款共有三亿七千九百七十五万元，增拨给河北、河南、安徽、江苏、浙江、黑龙江、吉林等七省的贷款达三亿一千八百一十万元；调拨了粮食七十九亿多斤。此外，还有大量的以工代赈款、土特产收购款、农业品预购款，以及免征、减征公粮等。巨大的物资支援，使许多被洪水毁灭的村庄在政府支持下重新建立了家园。特别是鼓舞了灾区农民抗灾的信心。
    在灾区开展大规模的生产自救运动中，农业社显示了无比的优越性。河北省随排水、随种麦，比往年提前十多天抢种小麦三千八百多万亩，超过了历史上最高的种麦面积。河南省灾区农业社在“与水争地”的口号下，一次又一次地排水补种，共种各种晚秋作物七百五十三万亩，收获粮食二亿二千万斤、红薯三亿斤、蔬菜八十二亿斤，大大加强了灾民度荒的力量。河南省去冬今春副业生产收入达到一亿零三百万元，有30％的灾民依靠副业收入克服了生活困难。江苏省灾情最重的淮阴专区，由于副业生产开展得好，今春圈存猪不但没有减少，而且比去年同期增多十三万多头。灾区农民普遍反映：有了合作化，什么都不怕。
    各地政府为解决灾民困难，除发动社和社、社员和社员之间互助互济、互相支援外，北京、天津、上海等城市和辽宁、山西、山东、湖北、内蒙古等省区人民，为支援灾民过冬，还开展了募捐寒衣运动。据不完全统计，共募捐寒衣一百四十八万多件和现金一百五十一万多元，粮食七十万斤。有些省市并向灾区派出医疗队，人民军队也曾给灾区以物质支援。在各方面的支援下，灾区人民的衣、食、住和疾病医疗问题得到了妥善解决。许多灾民感激地说：共产党和人民政府，比爹娘还亲。
    遭灾地区的各级干部同灾民同甘苦共患难，积极领导灾民抗灾度荒，博得了灾区广大人民的赞扬。河南、安徽等省的中共省委书记、省长以及各部门的负责干部，都先后分别率领工作组，深入灾区了解灾情，帮助灾民制定生产救灾计划。安徽省在雨雪严寒期间，仅阜阳专区就派出一千五百多干部下乡检查救灾工作，保证了灾区问题得以及时解决，阜阳县下乡干部们发现阜东第十五农业社有二十四户“五保户”缺柴烧，就亲自冒着雨雪到七里以外的地方为他们挑来三千多斤煤炭。江苏省淮阴专区在春节前组织一万多干部到各地查灾救急，泗阳县里仁区一百八十多个区、乡干部冒着雪给农民送粮送草。洪泽县老子山镇四个妇女干部曾连夜为一个七十多岁瞎老大娘缝好救济棉衣，老大娘感动得掉起泪来，说：“毛主席领导的干部真好”。各地灾区干部除注意克服当前生活中的困难外，还积极出注意、想办法加强生产工作，从多方面设法缩短荒期，减轻灾荒。
    内务部负责人说，去年的自然灾害是我国历史上少有的，它大于1954年，更大于1931年的水灾。灾区人民战胜这次巨大灾害，又一次证明了共产党领导下的社会主义制度的无比优越。在这样大的灾害侵袭下，除了少数轻灾地区对救灾工作注意不够，曾经发生过灾民盲目流入城市，以及广西省个别地区由于干部官僚主义发生因灾死亡严重情况外，重灾地区灾民基本上都能安居乐业。从总的情况看来，现在灾区麦子登场，灾民吃上了新粮，春荒已经度过了。但是还有一部分地区由于冬小麦播种粗糙和春旱，收成不好，少数灾区种麦不多，因此夏收后灾民生活还有一定困难。目前新灾又容易发生。各地领导部门对此已引起很大重视。安徽省已召开防灾会议，专门布置了预防今年自然灾害的工作。河南省发出了做好夏荒工作指示，要求各地防止麻痹思想，认真做好夏征减免工作，搞好农、副业生产，常年遭灾地区要大力发展饲养业，达到每户一口猪。
