　　We Protest the Malicious Attacks on Renmin University of China

After reading the two reports in the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily (“Renmin University of China is Like a Beehive of Dogmatism,” “Teachers Criticize Renmin University for Being ‘Neither Fish nor Fowl’… University Signboard, Secondary School Content, Primary School Teaching Methods”), we believe that these are malicious attacks on Renmin University of China. As students of Renmin University, we cannot but express our protest.

Living in this university, we are also sensitive to the "three evils" that exist in the school's leadership at all levels. Therefore, during the rectification movement, we not only supported the criticisms and suggestions made by those upright professors and lecturers to the school leaders, but also actively joined them in firing at the "three evils." However, what makes us indignant is that among the ranks of our respected teachers, there appeared people with ulterior motives who hated the Party and the people, such as Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou, and also people like Xu Mengxiong who scolded our school as a "beehive of dogmatism" and our students as "poisonous bees." Mr. Xu Mengxiong's attack on our school and our students in this way is intolerable to anyone with a little conscience.

What should attract people's attention here is: why are such empty, abusive, and maliciously slanderous "criticisms" particularly appreciated by Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, and others? They add "icing on the cake" with prominent space and particularly eye-catching large headlines. What are their intentions? This is worthy of deep thought.

Guangming Daily should investigate in depth whether our school is a murky "beehive"? Are those thousands of graduates and students who are studying hard "poisonous bees"? We want to remind these gentlemen that the vast majority of us are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members. Before entering the school, some of us were outstanding students in high schools, some were shock workers on the production front, and some even brought back glorious scars from the flames of war. Today, the Party is cultivating us into new-type worker-peasant intellectuals in the classroom. For the bourgeois rightists, imperialism, and its running dogs, this is of course a group of poisonous bees, but why is the Guangming Daily, which claims to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and uphold the socialist position, so panic-stricken?

Wenhui Daily tells readers with a large headline that Renmin University is run "neither fish nor fowl." It is true that Renmin University has not yet been run perfectly, and there are still many shortcomings, some of which are even very serious. However, we know that these are shortcomings in progress, and they will be overcome in the process of progress. The Party, the people, and we love this university. This university may not suit the tastes of some people, especially the tastes of the bourgeoisie. Because it is a university that trains cadres to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist economic system. It is no wonder that some people bitterly hate it and call it "neither fish nor fowl" and "a beehive of dogmatism."

Of course, we do not deny that there are still many shortcomings in our studies, such as a dogmatic atmosphere. At the same time, we do not deny that some of our comrades from worker-peasant-soldier backgrounds only attended junior high school in the past, but to think that we don't look like a university is a bit arbitrary. According to the "reports" of Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, this group of worker-peasant youths who did not get a high school diploma in the past, despite having improved their cultural level in the long revolutionary struggle and already possessing the conditions to enter university, should also be rejected by our own university.

We want to ask: Is this unrealistic reporting by Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily supporting correct criticism and helping Renmin University improve its work? Or is it confusing right and wrong? What is the purpose? What are the intentions? Indeed, we were awakened by a heavy blow. When we understood that Guangming Daily had editors-in-chief and presidents like Chu Anping and Zhang Bojun; when people exposed the bourgeois orientation of Wenhui Daily during this period, we could not but look at their attitude towards Renmin University from the perspective of class struggle.

Renmin University is the first new-type socialist university founded by the Party Central Committee and the state on vacant land with the help of Soviet experts. It has only been around for seven years, and there are shortcomings in teaching and other work, and the school is actively improving. But it is still worthy of being a university that trains cadres for propagating Marxism-Leninism and socialist construction. In recent years, its students have spread all over the country, and they have become or will become the backbone of economic construction and the warriors fighting against bourgeois idealism on the ideological front. It is no wonder that people with ulterior motives want to try every means to strike it down with one blow and deny it. In this way, they can shout: Look! The Communist Party does not know how to run a university and has failed in cultural education; learning from the Soviet Union is wrong and does not work. We say, gentlemen! Let your poisonous arrows fly, Renmin University is still growing from small to large, from immature to strong, and it is still training cadres for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and for socialist construction. And we will also love our school more, study harder, and prepare to be a warrior who propagates Marxism-Leninism and economic construction. Let us tell you, this new-type socialist university cannot be denied, your purpose will fail, and it will always fail!

### 我们抗议对中国人民大学的恶意攻击

　　我们抗议对中国人民大学的恶意攻击
    读了光明日报、文汇报的两篇报道（“中国人民大学像个教条主义的大蜂窝”，“教师批评人民大学办得‘四不像’……大学招牌、中学内容、小学教学方法”）以后，我们认为这是对中国人民大学的恶意攻击。我们作为人民大学的学生，不能不表示抗议。
    生活在这所大学里，我们对学校的各级领导所存在的“三害”也是敏感的。因此在整风运动中，我们不仅拥护那些正直的教授、讲师们对学校领导的批评和建议，而且也曾积极地和他们一起向“三害”开火。但是，使我们愤慨的是：在我们所尊敬的老师的行列中，竟出现了像葛佩琦、王德周等仇视党和人民的别有用心的分子，而且也有许孟雄等人骂我们学校是“教条主义的大蜂窝”，骂我们学生是“毒蜂”。许孟雄先生对我们学校，对我们学生如此攻击，是稍有良心的人所不能容忍的。
    这里应该引起人们注意的是：为什么像这样空洞无物的谩骂和恶意中伤的“批评”，会被光明日报、文汇报等特别欣赏。以显著的篇幅，特别醒目的大字标题来个“锦上添花”。其居心何在呢？这是值得人们深思的。
    光明日报应该深入了解一下我们的学校是不是乌烟瘴气的“大蜂窝”？那些毕了业的和正在努力学习的成千上万的大学生是不是“毒蜂”？我们要提醒这些先生们，我们绝大多数是共产党员、共青团员，入学以前我们有的是高中的优秀学生，有的是生产战线上的突击手，有的从战火里还带来了光荣的伤疤。在今天的课堂上党正把我们培养成为新型的工农知识分子。对资产阶级右派，帝国主义和其走狗来说，这当然是一群毒蜂，但标榜着接受共产党领导、维护社会主义立场的光明日报又为何如此心惊胆战呢？
    文汇报以大标题告诉读者说：人民大学办得“四不像”。的确人民大学现在还没有办得十全十美，缺点还是不少的，有的缺点甚至很严重。但是，我们知道这是前进中的缺点，也将在前进中克服。党、人民和我们是热爱这所大学的。这个大学可能不合某些人的口味，特别是资产阶级的口味。因为她是为了巩固无产阶级专政、巩固社会主义经济制度而培养干部的大学。也难怪有些人要深恶痛绝地骂她是“四不像”，“是教条主义的大蜂窝”。
    当然，我们不否认在学习中还有很多缺点，譬如有教条主义的气息，同时也不否认我们中间有的工农兵出身的同志，过去只念过初中，但就认为我们不像个大学，未免有点武断。按光明日报、文汇报的“报道”看来，这批过去没有捞上一张高中毕业文凭的工农青年，尽管在长期革命斗争中已提高了文化水平，已具备了进大学的条件，也应该被我们自己的大学拒之于门外了。
    我们要问：光明日报、文汇报这种不实事求是的报道是在支持正确的批评，帮助人民大学改进工作呢？还是在混淆是非？目的何在？居心何在？的确我们是挨了一猛棒才醒过来的，当我们明白了光明日报有储安平、章伯钧这样的总编辑和社长以后；当人们揭发了文汇报在这段时期中的资产阶级方向以后，我们不能不以阶级斗争的观点来看待他们对人民大学的态度了。
    人民大学是党中央和国家在空地上、在苏联专家的帮助下创办起来的第一所新型的社会主义大学，她的历史只有七年，在教学和其他工作方面是有缺点的，学校也在积极地改进中。但是她仍不愧为一个培养宣传马列主义和社会主义建设干部的大学。几年来，她的学生遍布全国，他们成为了或将要成为经济建设的骨干以及在思想战线上和资产阶级唯心主义作斗争的战士。这难怪别有用心的人们想千方百计地一棍子打死她，否定她。这样他们就可以高喊：看呀！共产党不懂得办大学，在文化教育方面已失败了；学习苏联是错误的、是行不通的。我们说，先生们！你们的毒箭尽管放吧，人民大学仍在从小到大从幼稚到壮健地成长，她仍然在为巩固无产阶级专政、为社会主义建设培养干部。而我们也将更热爱我们的学校，更努力地学习，准备作一个宣传马克思列宁主义和经济建设的战士。告诉你们，这所新型的社会主义大学是否定不了的，你们的目的落空了，而且会永远落空！
