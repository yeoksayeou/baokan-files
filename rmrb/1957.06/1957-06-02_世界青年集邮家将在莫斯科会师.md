The Sixth World Youth Festival, to be held in Moscow in July and August this year, will feature various gatherings. The Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Culture, and the Soviet Philatelic Association, with the sponsorship of the International Philatelic Federation, will organize an international philatelic exhibition through the festival's organizing committee.

When this news was released to the world, it was warmly welcomed by young stamp collectors from various countries.

According to the exhibition committee of the philatelic exhibition, the exhibits include: (1) Stamps from various countries around the world, (2) Stamps with themes such as youth, children, science, culture, art, sports, celebrities, animals, and flowers, (3) Antique stamps from before 1900, (4) Airmail stamps, (5) Other stamps that meet the purpose of the exhibition. In addition to postal departments of various countries and editorial departments of philatelic publications, members of festival committees, clubs, associations, groups, and organizations from various countries who are stamp collectors can participate, and individuals can also exhibit in their own names.

Our country has received the invitation to the exhibition and has begun preparations for participation. In our country's exhibits, in addition to the current various stamps of New China, we also plan to exhibit rare and precious antique stamps. This will arouse great interest among young stamp collectors from various countries at the international philatelic exhibition in Moscow. (Xia Zhonghan) (Attached picture)

    世界青年集邮家将在莫斯科会师
    今年7、8月间在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年联欢节，将有各种联欢活动。苏联邮电部、文化部和苏联集邮协会将在国际集邮协会的赞助下，由联欢节筹备委员会组织国际集邮展览会。
    当这个消息发布到全世界各地的时候，受到了各国青年集邮家们的热烈欢迎。
    据集邮展览会展出委员会消息，展览品包括：（一）世界各国邮票，（二）以青年、儿童、科学、文化、艺术、体育、名人、动物、花卉等为专题的邮票，（三）1900年以前的古票，（四）航空邮票，（五）其他符合于展览会目的的邮票。参加者除各国邮政业务部门和集邮刊物的编辑部外，凡是联欢节各国委员会、俱乐部、协会、小组、团体中的成员集邮者都能参加，还可以个人名义展出。
    我国已经接到展览会的邀请，并已开始着手筹备参加工作。在我国展品中除现行的新中国各种邮票外，还准备展出稀有的珍贵古票。这将在莫斯科的国际集邮展览会上引起各国青年集邮家们很大的兴趣。　　　　　（夏中汉）（附图片）
