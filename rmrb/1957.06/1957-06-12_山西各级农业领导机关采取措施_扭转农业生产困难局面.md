　　Agricultural Leadership Organs at All Levels in Shanxi Province Take Measures to Reverse Difficulties in Agricultural Production

According to Xinhua News Agency, agricultural leadership organs at all levels in Shanxi Province are taking various measures to reverse the backward situation in agricultural production leadership since the spring.

The person in charge of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction told Xinhua News Agency reporters that many agricultural production and agricultural capital construction projects in Shanxi Province this spring have not been fully completed according to plan. Among them, the worst completion was cotton sowing, which was 160,000 mu less than the national plan, and it is estimated that at least 15% of the already sown 5.3 million mu of cotton fields are missing seedlings. Soil and water conservation work was also only completed more than 70% of the original plan. This person in charge said that the main reasons for the poor completion of various production plans are not the advanced plans, nor the current natural disasters such as diseases and insect pests, but the lack of in-depth work by leading organs at all levels and the lack of specific measures.

The recent meeting of heads of agricultural and forestry bureaus of various special districts and counties held by the Department of Agricultural Construction studied ways to reverse the difficult situation. The meeting decided to do a good job in rushing to harvest and thresh the mature winter wheat, and strive to return every grain to the home; to fertilize and water the late-maturing winter wheat and spring wheat to strive for more production increases. At the same time, effectively do a good job in replanting wheat fields and field management of autumn crops to ensure that the seedlings are complete and strong. In terms of cotton, the main task is to seize the time to transplant seedlings and eliminate pests in a timely manner. In addition, it is also necessary to give full play to the role of water conservancy facilities, and to do a good job in drought prevention, flood control, and drainage preparations.

This person in charge said that after the meeting discussions and several instructions, leading cadres at all levels have gradually reached a consensus on the current difficulties, and are full of confidence in reversing the backward situation. Leading cadres in various counties in the Jinzhong area have gone to the fields in large numbers to lead farmers to replant cotton seedlings. Rural cadres in the Jinnan wheat-producing area, based on the lessons of last year and the characteristics of this year's more rain and wind, proposed to concentrate efforts on harvesting and transporting first, and then threshing and replanting separately. The implementation of this method can shorten the wheat harvest time, avoid wheat losses, and will not delay replanting.

　　山西各级农业领导机关采取措施
　　扭转农业生产困难局面
    据新华社讯  山西省各级农业领导机关正在采取各种措施，扭转春季以来农业生产领导上的落后局面。
    山西省农业建设厅负责人对新华社记者说，山西省今年春季农业生产和农业基本建设有许多项目没有全部完成计划。其中完成最差的是棉花播种比国家计划少了十六万亩，而且在已播种的五百三十多万亩棉田中估计至少缺苗15％。水土保持工作也只完成原计划的70％多。这位负责人说，各项生产计划完成不好的主要原因不是计划冒进，也不是目前发生的病、虫等自然灾害，而是各级领导机关工作不深入，缺乏具体措施。
    最近农业建设厅召开的各专区、县农林局局长会议，研究了扭转困难局面的办法。会议决定，对已经成熟的冬麦作好抢收抢打、细收细打，争取颗粒还家；对成熟较晚的冬麦和春麦要加肥加水，争取更多的增产。同时，切实作好麦田复播和大秋作物的田间管理，以保证苗全苗壮。在棉花方面，主要是抓紧时间移苗补苗，及时除灭虫害。此外，还要充分发挥水利设备的作用，并且作好防旱、防汛和排涝准备工作。
    这位负责人说，现在经过会议讨论和几次指示，各级领导干部对当前的困难认识渐趋一致，对扭转落后局面的信心也很充足。晋中地区各县领导干部已经大批走向田间，领导农民补种棉苗。晋南产麦区农村干部根据去年的教训和今年雨多风大的特点，他们提出先集中力量收割和运输，然后分别打场和复播。实行这种办法，即可缩短麦收时间，避免小麦损失，也不会耽误复播。
