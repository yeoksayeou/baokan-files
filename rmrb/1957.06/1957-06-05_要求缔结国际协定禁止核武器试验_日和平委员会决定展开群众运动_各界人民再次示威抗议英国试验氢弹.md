Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: The Japanese people demonstrated again in front of the British Embassy in Tokyo this afternoon to protest the British hydrogen bomb test near Christmas Island. This is the third demonstration held by the Japanese people in the last four days since Britain detonated its second hydrogen bomb.

Participating in today's demonstration were approximately 300 workers and students from organizations such as the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the Japan Teachers' Union, and the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union. Monks and nuns beating drums also participated in the protest demonstration.

Four representatives entered the embassy to demand that Britain stop hydrogen bomb testing. Officials at the British Embassy promised to convey their demands to the authorities in London. As the representatives entered the embassy, the demonstrators waved flags and sang songs in front of the embassy. Loudspeakers on propaganda vehicles also played music, and speeches were delivered.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: The Japan Peace Committee held a plenary meeting in Tokyo from June 1st to 3rd, adopted this year's work plan, and elected Yotaro Hirano, Ikuo Yasui, and twenty-four others as representatives to attend the World Peace Council meeting in Colombo.

The focus of this year's peace movement plan is to strive to unify the steps of peace groups, launch mass movements, thwart preparations for nuclear weapons war, and realize the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The meeting decided to launch a mass movement demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately begin negotiations on concluding an agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing, and to cease nuclear weapons testing during the negotiations. At the same time, it demanded that the Japanese government cancel its proposed prior registration system for nuclear tests, and immediately agree to the Soviet Union's proposed joint Soviet-Japanese proposal to ban nuclear tests.

The meeting decided that while launching the anti-nuclear weapons movement, it would also launch mass struggles against military bases, demanding the return of Okinawa, opposing the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, and demanding the abolition of the unequal Japan-U.S. treaty.

The meeting believes that restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and Korea is an indispensable condition for safeguarding peace in Asia. The Japan Peace Committee will organize mass forces to launch a movement to realize the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the conclusion of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, while striving to achieve the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty as soon as possible.
