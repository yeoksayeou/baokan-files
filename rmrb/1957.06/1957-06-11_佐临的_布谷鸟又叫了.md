　　Zuo Lin's "The Cuckoo Calls Again"
　　Li Jianwu
    Zuo Lin has white hair early, but his heart is so young. Only people with young hearts have the energy to laugh and understand the energy of laughter. Unable to see his Shakespeare (he would smile and say to you, "There are no conditions!" How could there be? He spread out a pair of delicate, long hands, and said no more), being able to see his comedy already makes Shanghai drama audiences feel satisfied.

    At the end of April, before I left Shanghai, I had the good fortune to see his newly directed "The Cuckoo Calls Again." I couldn't stop laughing and felt young again.

    The playwright Yang Lufang wants leaders to care about people and care more about people. This is a significant contradiction in the development of socialist society. Everyone wants to do great things, especially leading cadres, who work up a sweat but forget that great things are done by people. These respectable leading cadres, who constantly talk about materialism, fall into the quagmire of idealism when they start working. The play is not only written in an inflated manner, but also in such a cheerful and lively way, that it is rare to see a hint of formalism.

    But without Zuo Lin, this "The Cuckoo Calls Again" might have been a flop on stage. As the audience was leaving, one person said, "This play depends on the director." On second thought, it makes sense, since there are no stars here. They bowed three times in a row, and almost all the faces on stage were strangers that the audience was seeing for the first time. Zuo Lin has the ability to make the audience like these young people.

    For me, the faces are not unfamiliar. More than half of them were my students for a lesson or half a lesson, even the ones playing old women. Long time no see! You couldn't find a chance to be on stage at school, you only practiced without singing, and after graduation, you didn't practice or sing, and you still couldn't find a stage (verb. -- When I was a child, there were no drama schools to go to, I just hung around on the small stages of various schools). But you are really lucky, you just showed your faces and you met a comedy director like Zuo Lin (I acted in his plays, I know the real meaning of what I'm saying).

    I am also happy for Zuo Lin. The children have not disappointed his ingenuity. How well Xie Dehui laughs as the little cuckoo! A string of laughter, like a mountain stream jumping over rocks, like small bells ringing in the wind, nothing can stop her. But as she laughs, she cries, and her strong character makes her think it's funny again, and she laughs again. I can't tell if it's laughter or crying, I just feel that youth is like a surge of energy in my heart.

    The selfish and self-serving bureaucrat and the hardworking bureaucrat made the little cuckoo stop singing, but nature welcomes her and it to sing together, and the Party welcomes her such vigorous and unyielding character to fight for the cause of the Party.

    But why does our cuckoo sing with so much foreign flavor? Is the song too foreign, or the voice too foreign?

    Also, is the distance between you carrying the fat baskets from this side to that side, coming and going, going and coming, too close? But, after all, the play is a play, and it shows labor. If you were asked to handle it, how would you handle it? I really can't think of any other way to handle it.

    Unable to see Zuo Lin's Shakespeare, being able to see his lyrical comedy is still "losing in the east, but gaining in the west," which is better than seeing nothing at all.

### 佐临的“布谷鸟又叫了”

　　佐临的“布谷鸟又叫了”
　　李健吾
    佐临是少白头，心却那么年轻。心年轻的人才有笑劲儿，也才懂得笑劲儿。看不到他的莎士比亚（他会笑微微对你说：“没有条件嘛！”怎么会的？他摊开一双秀气的长手，不说下去了），能看到他的喜剧，上海话剧观众已经觉得满意了。
    4月底，我离开上海之前，有福气看到他新近导演的“布谷鸟又叫了”。我笑不拢口，觉得自己年轻了。
    剧作者杨履方要领导关心人，多关心人。这是社会主义社会事业发展中间的一个不小的矛盾。大家都要干大事，特别是领导干部，干的满头大汗，就忘记了大事是人干出来的。这些可尊敬的领导干部，口口声声唯物，作起事来，就跌进了唯心的泥塘子。戏不但写的臌囊囊的，还写的那样欢势、那样热闹，难得看见一星儿公式主义。
    可是没有佐临，这出“布谷鸟又叫了”，说不定在台上也会闷回去的。散场的时候，一个观众边走边说：“这出戏就看导演了。”一想也有道理，这里先没有角儿。一连谢了三次幕，台上几乎全是观众头一回看见的陌生面孔。佐临有本事叫观众喜欢这些年轻人。
    对我来说，脸模样并不陌生。有一大半，作过我的一课半课的学生，连扮老婆子的也是。久违了啊，你们在学校摸不着机会上台，光练不唱，毕了业，不练不唱，又摸不着台上（动词。——我小时候没有戏剧学校可进，只在各学校的小台子上混）。不过你们也真走运，才露脸，就碰着了佐临这样的喜剧导演（我在他底下演过戏，我知道我这话的实际意义）。
    我也替佐临开心。孩子们没有辜负他的匠心。谢德辉这个小布谷鸟儿笑的多好啊。连串儿笑，像山涧在乱石头上跳，像小玲璫在风地里响，别想有什么挡得住她。可是笑着笑着她就哭了，才哭，刚强的性格又让她想着好笑，她又笑了。我分不出是笑是哭，我只觉得青春像一股子气在我心里头窜。
    自私自利的官僚主义者、辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者害的小布谷鸟儿闷声不叫了，可是大自然欢迎她和它在一起歌唱，党欢迎她这样的生龙活虎的倔强性格为党的事业奋斗。
    可是我们的布谷鸟儿唱了起来，为什么那么多的洋味儿呢？是歌子太洋，还是嗓子太洋？
    还有，你们把肥筐从这边挑到那边，来了去，去了来，中间距离是不是太近了些？可是，戏到底是戏，这说明了劳动。叫你来处理，又怎么处理？我真还想不出别的法子处理。
    看不到佐临的莎士比亚，能看到他的抒情喜剧，却也“失之东隅，收之桑榆”，总比什么也看不到的强。
