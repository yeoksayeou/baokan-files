Socialist Transformation of Industrialists and Businessmen Must Not Be Obstructed
Many Criticize Zhang Naiqi's Erroneous Arguments at a Symposium on Guiding the Transformation of Industry and Commerce Organized by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

    (Our Dispatch) "At this critical juncture when the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is about to achieve complete victory, some people are obstructing us. We have a moral responsibility to say: This is not allowed!" This was a statement made by Hu Zi'ang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, at the closing session of the symposium on guiding the transformation of industry and commerce organized by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. In his concluding remarks yesterday, he pointed out that an important achievement of this symposium was the clear recognition that the debate on several fundamental issues concerning the transformation of capitalist enterprises and the bourgeoisie after the high tide of socialist transformation is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. He requested the delegates to promote the struggle between the two roads within the local organizations of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce after returning, and to help industrialists and businessmen stand firm and withstand the test in the midst of the great "blooming" and "contending."
    This meeting began on May 20th. On May 31st, Zhang Naiqi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, spoke at the meeting. Later, many people criticized the erroneous arguments in his speech in their own speeches.

    Huang Yanpei said: Everything is for Socialism

    Yesterday morning, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, gave a speech entitled "Everything is for Socialism." He encouraged everyone to continue to boldly "bloom" and "contend," to expose contradictions among the people, and to help the Party in its rectification campaign. However, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of taking the socialist road, to proceed from the interests of the country and the people, and to consolidate and strengthen the leadership of the Party on the basis of standing firm and distinguishing right from wrong. All speeches that deviate from socialism, violate the interests of the people, do not conform to the requirements of the Party's rectification campaign, or are not conducive to the socialist transformation of industrialists and businessmen must be opposed. Some of the views expressed by Comrade Zhang Naiqi in recent days, such as those concerning the issue of two-sidedness, the essential difference between the working class and bourgeois elements, and the nature of fixed interest, are, in my opinion, incorrect.

    He also said: Our belief and respect for the working class does not refer to any particular individual, but to the quality and spirit of the working class. This is: selflessness, serving the masses, organization, discipline, not caring about personal interests, and love of labor.

    He said: The Chinese national bourgeoisie, although undeniably some are backward, some are in the middle, but the majority are indeed active, and some are progressing particularly fast, but it cannot be said that these progressive elements in the industrial and commercial circles do not need to be transformed. It would be more accurate to say that advanced elements, like those in the middle and backward, are demanding transformation. Facts tell us that the more advanced they are, the more humbly they learn and constantly transform themselves.

    Finally, he said: Minister Li Weihan said in his concluding remarks: "We are willing to help the industrial and commercial circles smoothly pass through this transition period and become glorious laborers in a socialist society." We are willing to earnestly study and conscientiously practice to complete the socialist transformation, and are willing to do everything in our power to complete socialist construction.

    Hu Zi'ang believes: The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should adhere to a working line guided by socialist ideology

    After discussing the overview of the symposium and its evaluation, Hu Zi'ang said: Some people have proposed that the bourgeoisie no longer exploits, that taking fixed interest is simply unearned income; moreover, it takes twenty years for the fixed interest to break even; the bourgeoisie no longer has two-sidedness, and bourgeois elements, like workers, only have the "two-sidedness" of being advanced and backward, and there is no essential difference between the two, and so on. These arguments are clearly not in line with the current reality. These arguments are tantamount to saying that the bourgeoisie no longer needs to be transformed. This will inevitably make bourgeois elements who are advancing on the socialist road hesitate, stop, and even retreat. Therefore, the debate on these issues is no longer a general debate, but a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Our struggle is, in essence, to defend socialism, adhere to socialism, and help industrialists and businessmen take the bright road of socialism. Therefore, this struggle has great practical significance.

    Then, he said: Due to the existence of two guiding ideologies, socialism and capitalism, there are also two opposing working lines reflected in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's work of guiding the transformation of industry and commerce. One line is to help members play an active role in socialist construction, contribute all useful talents and wisdom; at the same time, take the enterprise as the base for transformation, and strive to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers in labor practice. This is the correct working line that we should adhere to. The other working line, on the one hand, talks about how the starting point of the guidance work is to do everything possible to improve the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen (but the purpose and method are not made clear); on the other hand, it affirms that fixed interest is not exploitation, and that there is no essential difference between workers and capitalists. This latter line essentially negates the necessity of industrialists and businessmen transforming into laborers, allowing industrialists and businessmen to remain at the current stage, allowing exploitation to continue to exist, allowing the bourgeoisie to continue to exist, that is, with the goal of protecting capitalism.

    When talking about the issue of representing the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, Hu Zi'ang said: Representing the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen must be premised on socialist interests. Without socialism, there is no legitimate interest to talk about. Li Kangnian advocated a fixed interest of twenty years, we can only say "sorry, we won't participate," because this is not a "legitimate interest" that we should represent. All opinions that are conducive to socialism, we must earnestly and actively reflect, in order to mobilize all the positive factors of industrialists and businessmen, serve socialist construction, and at the same time promote their better self-transformation.

    Li Zhuchen believes: Refuting remarks that deviate from socialism is not "closing up"; active criticism still requires "blooming" and "contending."

    Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke at the closing session. When talking about the question of whether the recent refutation by workers of remarks that deviate from socialism is "closing up," he said that since it is "letting a hundred flowers bloom," everyone should "bloom." For many absurd remarks, the working class should be allowed to speak out. Some people say that they don't want the leadership of the Communist Party, then who should lead? The democratic parties cannot lead, so should imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek lead? Such reactionary and absurd remarks are like floods and fierce beasts, and should naturally be refuted and corrected. Of course, active criticism still requires "blooming" and "contending."

### 不允许阻碍工商业者的社会主义改造  许多人在民建中央工商改造辅导工作座谈会上批评章乃器的错误论点

　　不允许阻碍工商业者的社会主义改造
　　许多人在民建中央工商改造辅导工作座谈会上批评章乃器的错误论点
    本报讯  “在资本主义工商业社会主义改造即将彻底胜利的关头，有人阻碍我们。我们在道义上有责任说：这是不允许的！”这是中国民主建国会副主任委员胡子昂在民建中央召开的工商改造辅导工作座谈会闭幕会上讲的一句话。他在昨天的这个总结发言中指出，这次座谈会的一个重要的收获，是明确认识了在社会主义改造高潮以后，关于资本主义企业和资产阶级改造方面的几个带根本性问题的争论，其性质是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。他要求与会代表回去以后，推动民建地方组织继续开展两条道路的斗争，帮助工商业者在大“鸣”大“放”中站稳立场，经得起考验。
    这个会是从5月20日开始举行的。5月31日，民建会副主任委员章乃器在会上讲了话。后来，许多人在发言中对他讲话中错误的论点提出了批评。
    黄炎培说：一切为了社会主义
    昨天上午，民建会主任委员黄炎培以“一切为了社会主义”为题讲了话。他鼓励大家继续大胆的“鸣”“放”揭露人民内部矛盾，帮助党整风。但必须坚持走社会主义道路的原则，一切从国家利益，人民利益出发，在站稳立场，明辨是非的基础上，来巩固和加强党的领导。对于一切离开社会主义的、违反人民利益的、不符合党的整风要求的、不利于工商业者的社会主义改造的言论必须反对。这几天章乃器同志所发表的意见中，有些论点，如关于两面性问题，关于工人阶级与资产阶级分子的本质区别问题，定息的性质问题等，我认为是不对的。
    他还说：我们信仰、敬重工人阶级，不是指某一个人，而是工人阶级的品质、精神。这就是：大公无私，为群众服务，组织性，纪律性，不计较个人利益，热爱劳动。
    他说：中国民族资产阶级，虽然无可讳言地还有一部分是落后的，一部分是中间的，但大部分确是积极的，而且有些进步得特别快，可是，绝不能说这些工商界进步分子不需要改造。正确些还是说，先进分子跟那些中间、落后分子同样的在要求改造。事实告诉我们，越是先进，越是虚心学习，不断地在自我改造。
    最后他说：李维汉部长在总结发言中说：“愿意帮助工商界平平稳稳地走过这过渡时期，变成社会主义社会的光荣劳动者”。我们愿意认真学习，认真实践，来完成社会主义改造，愿意竭尽所有力量来完成社会主义建设。
    胡子昂认为：民建应该坚持以社会主义思想为指导的工作路线
    胡子昂在谈了座谈会的概况和对会议的估价以后说：有人提出，资产阶级已经没有剥削了，拿定息只是不劳而获的收入；而且定息二十年才够本；资产阶级已经没有两面性了，资产阶级分子同工人一样，只有先进和落后的“两面性”二者没有本质的差别，等等。这些论点显然是不符合当前实际情况的。这些论点等于说，资产阶级再不需要改造了。这必然会使得正在社会主义道路上前进的资产阶级分子彷徨却步，以至倒退。因此，对这些问题的争论已经不是一般性质的争论，而是属于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们进行这个斗争，实质上就是捍卫社会主义，坚持社会主义，帮助工商业者走社会主义的光明道路。因此，这个斗争具有重大的现实意义。
    接着，他说：由于有社会主义和资本主义两种指导思想，反映在民建会的工商改造辅导工作上，也就构成两条对立的工作路线。一条路线是帮助会员在社会主义建设中发挥积极作用，贡献一切有用的才能和智慧；同时，以企业为改造基地，在劳动实践中努力把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。这是我们应该坚持的正确的工作路线。另一条工作路线，一方面讲什么辅导工作的出发点是想尽一切办法提高工商业者的积极性（但是目的是什么、办法是什么都没有讲清楚）；另一方面，却肯定定息不是剥削，工人同资本家没有本质区别。这后一条路线，实质上是否定了工商业者向劳动者转化的必要，让工商业者停留在现阶段，让剥削继续存在，让资产阶级继续存在，也就是说，以保护资本主义为目标。
    在谈到代表工商业者合法利益问题的时候，胡子昂说：代表工商业者合法利益，必须以社会主义利益为前提。离开社会主义，就没有合法利益可谈。李康年主张定息二十年，我们就只能说“恕不奉陪”，因为这不是我们应该代表的“合法利益”。一切有利于社会主义的意见，我们就要认真、积极地反映，以便调动工商业者的一切积极因素，为社会主义建设服务，同时促进他们更好地进行自我改造。
    李烛尘认为：驳斥脱离社会主义的言论并不是“收”；积极的批评还是要“鸣”“放”。
    民建会副主任委员李烛尘也在闭幕会上讲了话。在谈到最近几天工人驳斥脱离社会主义言论，是不是“收”的问题的时候，他说，既然是“百家争鸣”，就应该大家都“鸣”。对于许多荒谬言论，更应该让工人阶级出来讲话。有人说不要共产党领导，那要谁来领导？民主党派领导不了，难道要帝国主义、蒋介石来领导吗？像这样的反动、荒谬的言论，犹如洪水猛兽，自然应该驳斥纠正。当然，积极的批评还是要“鸣”“放”。
