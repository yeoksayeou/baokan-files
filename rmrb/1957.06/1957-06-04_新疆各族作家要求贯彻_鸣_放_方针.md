Urumqi Dispatch from Our Newspaper: At the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Writers' Representative Conference, several representatives from Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic groups held a discussion on the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy on May 23. Mand, a Kazakh writer, said: "Socialist transformation is underway in the pastoral areas, but the leadership has not organized literary and art workers to go deep into the pastoral areas. Therefore, there are very few works by Kazakh literary and art workers reflecting the current political struggle." He suggested that the autonomous region's literary and art leadership departments establish grassroots leadership organizations to strengthen unified leadership over literary and art workers. Nurmehmet Erkin (Uyghur), a writer from Kashgar, believes that the Party's "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy has not been well implemented, and literary and art workers at the lower levels do not understand this policy. He mentioned the current state of literature and art in Kashgar, saying that Kashgar's theaters have now become cinemas because there are no plays to perform. Some authors have written scripts and submitted them to the leadership for review, but the leadership says they don't understand and passes them on to experts, but the scripts disappear without a trace and receive no response. He said that now it is not that literary and art workers do not want to "bloom" or "contend," but that no one supports them. Juma Hong (Kyrgyz) said: Some literary leaders do not study hard, do not understand the characteristics of literature and art, and use administrative orders to demand that writers produce works in a certain number of days. Huda Ahmet Tarif (Uyghur) said: "The leadership demands too much from literary and art workers but provides little support, even mistakenly suggesting that they should not write those trivial things that are sung and spoken, but should write like Pushkin. But on the contrary, they do not provide writers with convenient conditions for creation. Now Urumqi City has begun to 'bloom,' but the lower levels have not 'bloomed.'" Hudi Ahmet (Uyghur) said: "The leadership does not utilize local forces and only sends writers down to experience life. As a result, time and money are spent, but no good works are produced." Ashar (Kazakh) said: "I don't know about the autonomous region's Federation of Literary and Art Circles' leadership over literary and art work in Urumqi, but leadership at the lower levels is non-existent. There is bureaucracy in the leadership of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' policy has only been announced in newspapers and periodicals, but the leadership has not taught literary and art workers how to do it. I hope that the establishment of the Writers Association will change this situation." At the discussion, everyone also criticized the autonomous region's several literary publications and editorial departments. Sharigan (Kazakh) said: "From last autumn to this spring, I wrote eighteen poems for a literary publication in Yili, but none of them were published, and no reason was given." Ashar said: "I think the autonomous region's several literary publications have become publications for some teachers at Xinjiang College and Urumqi City. It's truly 'whoever sits next to the pot gets their spoon in first.'" Aisnakar (Uzbek) said: "We Uzbeks don't even have a small newspaper. We mainly rely on the Soviet Compatriot Association in Yili to supply some literary readings. Our own amateur creative group was also disbanded because there was no one to guide it. 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom' means letting the flowers of every ethnic group bloom. I hope the leadership will pay attention to the training of young Uzbek authors."

    新疆各族作家要求贯彻“鸣”“放”方针
    本报乌鲁木齐电　出席新疆维吾尔自治区作家代表会议的维吾尔、哈萨克、乌兹别克、柯尔克孜等民族的多位代表，5月23日座谈了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。哈萨克族的曼德说：“牧区正进行社会主义改造，但领导上没有组织文艺工作者深入牧区，因此，哈萨克族的文艺工作者反映当前政治斗争的作品很少。”他建议自治区文艺领导部门在下面设立基层领导机构，以加强对文艺工作者的统一领导。来自喀什的作家努尔买海买提艾尔肯（维吾尔族）认为党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针还没有很好的贯彻下去，下面的文艺工作者对这个方针还不了解。他提到喀什的文艺现状时说，喀什的剧院目前都变成了电影院，原因是没有戏演。一些作者写出了剧本请领导上审查，但领导上说他们不懂，转给内行的同志去看，结果像石沉大海，得不到答复。他说，现在不是文艺工作者不想放，不想鸣，而是没人支持。居马洪（柯尔克孜族）说：有些文艺领导人不好好学习，不懂得文艺的特点，用行政命令要作家在多少天写出什么作品。胡道外特塔里甫（维吾尔族）说：“领导上对文艺工作者要求高，支持少，甚至错误地提出，不要写说说唱唱那些小玩意，应该像普希金那样写才对。但相反，他们又不给作家创作的方便条件。现在乌鲁木齐市开始‘放’了，但底下并没有放。”呼地阿赫买特（维吾尔族）说：“领导上不利用当地的力量，只往下派作家去体验生活，结果，花了时间，花了钱，还没有写出好作品。”阿斯哈尔（哈萨克族）说：“自治区文联对乌鲁木齐的文艺工作的领导，我不知道，可是，对下边的领导是根本谈不到的，文联领导上有官僚主义，‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’的方针只在报刊上公布了，但领导上没有教给文艺工作者怎么做。希望作家协会成立后能改变这种状况。”座谈会上，大家对自治区的几个文学刊物和编辑部也提出了批评。沙里根（哈萨克族）说：“去年秋天到今年春天，我给伊犁的一个文学刊物写了十八首诗，但都没有发表，也没有说明原因。”阿斯哈尔说：“我觉得自治区的几个文学刊物变成了新疆学院和乌鲁木齐市一些教员的刊物，真是‘谁坐在锅跟前，谁的勺子先下锅。’”艾丝那喀热（乌兹别克族）说：“我们乌兹别克族连一个小报纸也没有，主要靠伊犁苏联侨民协会供给一些文学读物；我们自己组织的业余创作小组，也因为无人指导而散伙了。‘百花齐放’是让每个民族的花朵都开放起来，希望领导上重视对乌兹别克青年作者的培养。”
