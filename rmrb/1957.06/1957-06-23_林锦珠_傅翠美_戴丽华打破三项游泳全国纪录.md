Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Young swimmers Lin Jinzhu, Fu Cuimei, and Dai Lihua broke three national swimming records in Beijing today.

To welcome the upcoming visit of the Japanese Waseda University swimming team, the Chinese Youth Swimming Team held a performance competition at the Beijing Gymnasium this afternoon. In the men's 100-meter freestyle performance, Lin Jinzhu broke his own national record of 57.8 seconds with a time of 57.6 seconds. Lin Jinzhu had already set a new national record of 57.6 seconds in Beijing on June 15th.

Fu Cuimei broke two national records today: In the women's 100-meter backstroke performance, she broke her own national record of 1 minute 22.3 seconds with a time of 1 minute 22.1 seconds; In the women's 100-meter freestyle performance, after fierce competition with Dai Lihua, both achieved a time of 1 minute 11 seconds, breaking Dai Lihua's national record of 1 minute 11.2 seconds set in 1955.

The famous breaststroke swimmer Qi Lieyun also achieved good results in today's performance. His time for the 100-meter breaststroke reached 1 minute 12.1 seconds, once again exceeding the new standard of 1 minute 13 seconds set by the International Swimming Federation (exceeding this standard allows for application as a world record). However, this result was slightly worse than the 1 minute 11.6 seconds he achieved on May 1st of this year.

Qi Lieyun's time for the 200-meter breaststroke today was 2 minutes 40.5 seconds, very close to the new standard of 2 minutes 40 seconds set by the International Swimming Federation for applying for a world record.

Since the International Swimming Federation announced the regulation prohibiting underwater swimming during breaststroke, Mu Xiangxiong, who was originally good at underwater swimming, seems not yet accustomed to this regulation. His time for the 100-meter breaststroke today was only 1 minute 14.2 seconds, and his time for the 200-meter breaststroke was 2 minutes 43.2 seconds.

　　林锦珠　傅翠美　戴丽华打破三项游泳全国纪录
    新华社22日讯　年轻的游泳运动员林锦珠、傅翠美和戴丽华，今天在北京打破了三项游泳全国纪录。
    为了欢迎即将来华访问的日本早稻田大学游泳队，中国青年游泳队今天下午在北京体育馆举行了表演比赛。林锦珠在男子一百公尺自由泳表演中，又以五十七秒六的成绩打破了他自己保持的五十七秒八的全国纪录。林锦珠15日在北京就曾经创造过五十七秒六的全国新成绩。
    傅翠美今天共打破了两项全国纪录：在女子一百公尺仰泳表演中，她以一分二十二秒一的成绩打破了她自己保持的一分二十二秒三的全国纪录；在女子一百公尺自由泳表演中，她同戴丽华经过激烈的竞争以后，成绩都达到了一分十一秒，打破了戴丽华在1955年创造的一分十一秒二的全国纪录。
    著名的蛙泳运动员戚烈云在今天的表演中，也创造了良好的成绩。他一百公尺蛙泳的成绩达到了一分十二秒一，再一次超过了国际游泳联合会新规定的一分十三秒的标准（超过这个标准就能申请作为世界纪录）。但是这个成绩比他今年5月1日创造的一分十一秒六的成绩差了些。
    戚烈云今天二百公尺蛙泳的成绩是二分四十秒五，同国际游泳联合会规定的申请世界纪录的新标准——二分四十秒极接近。
    自从国际游泳联合会宣布了蛙泳时不准利用潜泳的规定以后，原来善于潜游的穆祥雄看来对这个规定还不大习惯。他今天一百公尺蛙泳的成绩只达到了一分十四秒二，二百公尺蛙泳的成绩是二分四十三秒二。
