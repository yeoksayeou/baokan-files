The methods of feeding draft cattle in agricultural cooperatives can be roughly divided into two types: centralized feeding and dispersed feeding. Centralized feeding has achieved some successful experiences in a few cooperatives with good foundations and relatively complete equipment and technical conditions. However, in general cooperatives, due to the current limitations of various conditions, it has not been done well, and draft cattle are generally weak and prone to illness, with a large number of abnormal deaths, a phenomenon that has reached an alarming level in some cooperatives. However, in the same region (disaster area or area with poor harvest) and under the same conditions (both are new cooperatives, etc.), draft cattle raised by dispersed feeding are in much better condition. Most draft cattle are not so weak and prone to illness, and the number of abnormal deaths is very small. Some regions or cooperatives do not even have this phenomenon at all.

Why does centralized feeding lead to such results in general cooperatives? This is because, in general cooperatives, neither subjectively nor objectively, do they have the various conditions necessary for centralized feeding. Farmers have also lacked experience in centralized feeding of draft cattle for many years. Forcibly implementing centralized feeding will naturally lead to losses.

Draft cattle have many unique living habits. They eat slowly, and they have to ruminate after eating; they don't drink much water at a time, but they need to drink frequently; they need to lie down to rest, and ruminate slowly while resting.

Currently, most cooperatives cannot spend a lot of money to build large and suitable cowsheds. In some places, many draft cattle are crowded together in old, small cowsheds. In other places, draft cattle are kept in the open air, where they cannot eat well, drink well, or lie down. Even when they lie down, they are covered in manure and urine, and the environment is damp and unhygienic. After working, the animals cannot rest properly or ruminate properly. Their fatigue cannot be recovered, but the work they have to do has not diminished at all. In this way, naturally, the "fat ones become thin, and the thin ones die." At the same time, with centralized feeding, one person cannot take care of everything. Several people take turns feeding, and no one can become familiar with the habits of each cow. People cannot all live near the cowshed, so there are often careless, perfunctory, and shirking phenomena in feeding. When draft cattle are concentrated together, forage is easily wasted, which exacerbates the shortage of forage, and it is also easy to spread epidemics. As for the damage of farm tools and furniture and the small amount of fertilizer accumulated, these are even more common phenomena.

In many places, the situation of dispersed feeding is often the opposite. Many farmers not only have ready-made cowsheds and other cattle-feeding equipment at home, but also have many years of experience in dispersed feeding. Not only can the main labor force feed, but also the elderly, women, and children can help. When people go to the fields, they can conveniently cut some green grass and bring it back. Women and children can also take the cattle out for grazing in the early morning and evening, which saves even more forage; it is also easier for people to become familiar with the habits of draft cattle. Over time, people develop feelings for the draft cattle they raise, and the draft cattle become more accustomed to their surroundings. People take better care of them, and the draft cattle can easily recover and enhance their physical strength and health. If they get sick, it is easier to detect and prevent it. Padding and cleaning the enclosure are less laborious. Padding and cleaning are done frequently, which not only improves the hygiene of the draft cattle's environment, but also accumulates more fertilizer.

Precisely because dispersed feeding has these convenient conditions, some cooperatives have changed from centralized feeding to dispersed feeding. After a short period of time, they have stopped the abnormal death of draft cattle, and the condition of being weak and prone to illness has quickly turned around.

Of course, this does not mean that simply or hastily dispersing the draft cattle raised by centralized feeding will be able to feed the draft cattle well. With simplistic working methods, even good things can be turned into bad things. In actual work, there are naturally certain difficulties. That is: due to the change in ownership, not every member can take care of the collectively owned draft cattle as they used to care for their own. Due to the current shortage of feed and forage, members are not necessarily willing to accept the task of feeding draft cattle. Moreover, if education work is not strengthened, there may still be cases of corruption and waste.

Therefore, dispersed feeding must also be followed up with several specific measures in order to do well. One of the basic issues is to enable the members who feed draft cattle to obtain practical benefits and receive necessary education.

Among the measures taken in various places, the following are generally effective: After full deliberation, on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, the draft cattle are fixed to those who are loyal, reliable, and have experience in feeding cattle. The members trust him, and he himself feels honored. Those with large cowsheds and a lot of labor can feed two or three cattle. Those with less labor and small cowsheds can only feed one. A pair of oxen can be fixed to one household, or it can be fixed to households of members living in the same courtyard or nearby, so that it is convenient to harness the cart and match the oxen.

Secondly, the method of setting the amount of grass, feed, fatness, work, reproduction (calves), and work points is adopted, that is, the cooperative or production team supplies a certain amount of forage, feed, a small amount of salt, and herbal medicines for relieving summer heat and keeping warm in winter for a certain period of time. The members responsible for feeding the draft cattle guarantee that the draft cattle always have the ability to work and have good body fat, and that the cows are mated in a timely manner, and that the calves are well cared for, etc., and then the cooperative gives a certain amount of labor work point remuneration per year or per month. Rewards are given for meeting the prescribed requirements, and appropriate penalties are given for failing to meet the requirements.

In some places, in order to prevent corruption and waste of forage and feed, a method called "total contracting" is adopted. On the condition of guaranteeing the above requirements, the cooperative gives relatively generous, fixed material or cash remuneration, and all grass and other materials are planned by the members responsible for feeding the draft cattle. They can buy grass and feed from the cooperative, and the price is deducted from the remuneration given to them. In this way, members can think of ways to feed grass and feed in many ways, and get more remuneration, and the expenses in the cooperative can be more economical. Some cooperatives have also priced the draft cattle. The increased price of the draft cattle that have gained weight or become stronger is all used as the income of the members. Some cooperatives have also adopted the method of paying remuneration according to the amount of labor of the draft cattle. The better the draft cattle are fed and the more work they do, the more income the people who feed the draft cattle will have. In this way, it can also better improve people's enthusiasm for feeding draft cattle well.

Many cooperatives have also combined the people who feed draft cattle with the people who use draft cattle in collective production in a fixed way. In some places, the people who feed and the people who use have signed a cooperation pact or a combination contract, both parties guarantee each other, help each other, and supervise each other, which is more conducive to the protection of draft cattle and production. Some places implement the method of integrating raising and using, and the person who feeds the draft cattle is the person who uses the draft cattle. This is the most reasonable management method and should be vigorously promoted.

In some places, members have bought cattle and donkeys for their own convenience in using them for pushing rice, grinding flour, and cultivating private plots, etc. The cooperative gives appropriate care in terms of forage and feed, and the draft power can be hired when the draft power is insufficient during the busy farming season. Both parties benefit, and it should be advocated.

This method of dispersed feeding is generally applicable to donkeys used for service in various places. As for mules and horses used for service in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and various places, due to past experience in centralized feeding, coupled with the short frost-free period in those places and the tight working time, special personnel are needed to feed and take care of them all night, etc., they can be raised collectively, but they should not be over-concentrated, and if centralized feeding is not good, necessary decentralization is also needed. In some places, the method of dividing yokes or dividing sets for feeding is adopted, that is, the mules and horses that are often harnessed to a car or a yoke are handed over to the person in charge of the service to be responsible for feeding, which is convenient for service and feeding, and is also more conducive to protecting the mules and horses. This method is also more reasonable.

For the method of dispersed feeding, some comrades, after repeated comparisons and calculations, although they feel that it is indeed better than centralized feeding, are hesitant and unwilling to make up their minds to do it. The reason is: in addition to some practical difficulties, there are still some doubts and concerns in their minds, such as some people saying: "Does this shake the principles of socialism?" "Is it right for advanced collective production organizations to adopt such a decentralized and backward method?"

These doubts and concerns are unnecessary. First, it does not violate the principle of collective ownership of the agricultural cooperative, because the draft cattle are still owned by the cooperative; second, it does not violate the principle of unified use, because the use of the draft cattle is still unified. Dispersed feeding is only a specific practice in the management of draft cattle. The reason why these comrades have these doubts and concerns is mainly that they do not yet understand that under the principle of adhering to the collective ownership and unified management of the agricultural cooperative, adopting some specific, flexible, and practical methods in the specific management work not only does not violate the above principles, but on the contrary, is of great benefit to implementing and realizing these principles and consolidating this collective economic organization, and is also necessary in actual work. This correct combination of principle and flexibility is not only necessary in solving the problem of draft cattle, but also very necessary for handling various problems of agricultural cooperatives.

### 大力推广分散喂养耕牛的经验

    大力推广分散喂养耕牛的经验
    农业社喂养耕牛的办法，大体上可以分做两种：一种是集中喂养，另一种是分散喂养。集中喂养的办法，在少数基础好、设备和技术条件比较齐全的合作社里，已经有了一些成功的经验。而在一般的合作社里，由于当前各种条件的限制，却一直没有搞好，耕牛普遍瘦弱多病，非正常的死亡为数很多，这种现象在部分的合作社里达到了惊人的程度。但在同一地区（灾区或歉收的地区）、同等条件（同样都是新社等）之下，分散喂养的耕牛，情况却是好得多，多数耕牛并不是那样瘦弱、多病，非正常的死亡的数量很少，有些地区或合作社甚至根本没有这种现象发生。
    为什么集中喂养的办法在一般的合作社里会带来这样的结果呢？这是因为：在一般的合作社里，不论主观上或客观上，都还没有集中喂养所必需的各种条件，农民多少年来也没有集中喂养耕牛的经验，勉强地实行集中喂养，自然要遭受损失。
    耕牛有许多特有的生活习性。吃得慢，吃了东西还要反刍；每次饮水不多，但饮水的次数要勤，要卧下来休息，一面休息，一面慢慢地反刍。
    目前，大多数合作社还不能花很多钱去修盖庞大而又合乎要求的牛舍。有的地方在旧有的小牛舍里，许多头耕牛拥挤在一起。还有一些地方把耕牛放在露天里，吃不好，饮不好，卧不下，卧下来也是粪尿泥泞，阴湿不堪。牲口干完了活不能好好休息，也不能好好反刍，疲劳不能恢复，但使役却丝毫没有减轻。这样，自然就把“肥的拖瘦，瘦的拖死”。同时，集中喂养，一个人看管不过来，几个人轮流喂养，谁也不能把每头牛的习性摸熟，人们又不能都住在牛舍跟前，在喂养上也就时常要发生马虎大意、互相推诿、应付了事的现象。而耕牛集中在一起，草料容易浪费，就加重了草料的困难，并且还容易传染疫病。至于农具、家具损坏、肥料积得少，更是普遍的现象。
    分散喂养的情况，在许多地方常常是恰恰相反的。许多农民不仅家里有现成的牛舍和其他喂牛的设备，并且多少年来就有分散喂养的经验。不仅主要的劳动力可以喂，老人、妇女、小孩也都可以帮着喂。人们下地的时候，可以顺便地割点青草回来，一早一晚妇女、小孩还可以把牛带到外边放一放，饲草、饲料也就更加节省；也便于人们去摸熟耕牛的习性。时间长了，人们就和自己喂养的耕牛有了感情，耕牛也更加习惯于自己的周围环境。人们照顾得比较周到一些，耕牛也就容易恢复和增强它的体力和健康，有了病，易于发现和防治。垫圈、除圈比较省力，垫得勤、除得勤，不仅耕牛的环境卫生好，还可以多积一些肥料。
    正是因为分散喂牛有这样一些方便条件，有些合作社已经把集中喂养改变为分散喂养，经过很短的时间之后，就制止了耕牛的非正常死亡现象，瘦弱多病的状况也很快地扭转过来。
    当然，这也决不是说只要把集中喂养的耕牛简单地或者草率地分散开来，就能把耕牛喂好。简单化的工作方法，好事也要办成坏事的。而在实际工作中，自然还有一定的困难，这就是：由于所有制的改变，社员们并不是每个人都能像以前对待自己的耕牛那样爱护集体所有的耕牛。由于当前饲料和饲草的困难，社员们也不一定都乐意接受喂养耕牛的任务。而且，如果教育工作抓不紧，也还会发生贪污浪费等情况。
    因此，分散喂养也还必须有若干具体的措施跟上去，才能搞好。其中一个基本的问题，是使喂养耕牛的社员获得实际的利益，并受到必要的教育。
    在各地所采取的一些措施当中，行之有效的大体上有这样一些：经过充分的酝酿之后，在自愿和互利的原则下，把耕牛固定给那些忠实可靠而又有喂牛经验的人，社员们相信他，他本人也觉得光荣。家里牛舍宽大、劳力又多的可以喂养两三头牛。劳力不多，牛舍不大的就只喂一头。一副牛犋可以固定给一户，也可以固定给住在一个院落里的或邻近的社员家里，套车和配犋都方便。
    其次采取定草、定料、定膘、定活、定繁殖（小牛）、定工分的办法，就是由合作社或生产队在一定的时间里供给一定数量的饲草、饲料和少量的食盐以及夏季去暑冬季保暖的草药等等，负责饲养耕牛的社员保证耕牛经常有使役的能力和体膘，母牛适时交配，生了小牛保养好等等，而后一年或一个月由合作社给予多少劳动工分的报酬。达到了规定要求的给予奖励，达不到要求就给予适当的处罚。
    有的地方，为了防止对饲草、饲料的贪污、浪费，采取了叫做“大包干”的办法。在保证上述各项要求的条件下，合作社给予比较优厚的、固定的物质或现金报酬，一切草料等等由负责饲养耕牛的社员自行筹划，可以向合作社买草买料，代价从给他的报酬当中扣除。这样，社员们在喂草喂料方面就能够从多方面去想办法，得到的报酬较多，而合作社里的开支也就可以更加节省。有的社还把耕牛作了价，耕牛长了膘或者由弱变强，增价部分都做为社员的收入。有的社，还采取了按耕牛的劳动量付给报酬的办法，耕牛喂养得越好，干活越多，喂养耕牛的人收入也就越多。这样，也就更能提高人们喂好耕牛的积极性。
    许多合作社又把喂养耕牛的人和在集体生产当中固定使役耕牛的人结合起来，有的地方是喂养的人和使役的人订立了合作公约或结合合同，双方互相保证，互相帮助，又互相监督，这样对于保护耕牛和生产更加有利。有的地方实行养用合一的办法，喂养耕牛的人就是使用耕牛的人。这是最为合理的管理办法，应当大力推广。
    有的地方，社员们为了家庭推米、磨面、耕作自留地等使用方便，自己买了牛、驴，合作社在饲草、饲料等方面给予适当的照顾，农忙时畜力不足可以雇用，双方都有利，应当加以提倡。
    这种分散喂养的办法，对于各地役用的毛驴，大体上也是适用的。至于东北、内蒙古和各地役用的骡马，由于过去有集中喂养的经验，加上在那些地方无霜期短，耕作时间紧张，整夜需要专人喂养照料等条件，是可以集体饲养的，但是也不应当过分集中，集中饲养不好的也需要做必要的分散。有些地方，采用分犋或分套喂养的办法，就是把经常套在一辆车上或一副犋上的骡马，交由负责使役的人负责喂养，既便于使役、喂养，对保护骡马也更加有利，这种办法，也是比较合理的。
    对于分散喂养的办法，有一部分同志在做了反复的比较和计算之后，虽然觉得确比集中饲养为好，但却犹豫不定，不肯下决心去做。原因是：除了若干实际困难以外，在思想上还有一些怀疑和顾虑，如有人说：“这样一来，是不是动摇了社会主义的原则呢？”“先进的集体生产组织，采用这样分散、落后的办法，对不对头呢？”
    这种怀疑与顾虑是可以不必要的。第一，它没有破坏农业社的集体所有制的原则，因为耕牛仍然是社所有的；第二，也没有破坏统一使用的原则，因为耕牛的使用仍然是统一的。而分散喂养只是在管理耕牛方面的一种具体作法而已。这些同志所以产生这些怀疑与顾虑，主要是他们还不了解：在坚持农业社的集体所有制和统一经营的原则下，在具体的经营管理工作方面，采取了一些具体的、灵活的和切合实际需要的办法，不仅没有破坏了以上的原则，而且相反地对贯彻实现这些原则和巩固这种集体经济组织有很大的好处，也是在实际工作中所必需的。这种原则性与灵活性正确结合的做法，不仅在解决耕牛问题上是必需的，对于处理农业合作社的各种问题来说，也是非常必要的。
