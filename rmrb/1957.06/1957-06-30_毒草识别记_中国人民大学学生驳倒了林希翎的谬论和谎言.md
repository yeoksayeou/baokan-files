A Record of Identifying Poisonous Weeds
Students of Renmin University of China Refute Lin Xiling's Fallacies and Lies
Xinhua News Agency Reporters Zheng Boya, Ding Baofang

The Awakening of the Deceived
"I would never drink a cup of poisonous water that is obviously colored, but I drank a cup of poisonous water that appeared clear and colorless!"

This is a statement from a college student who was deceived by the anti-socialist remarks of right-wingers. His name is Hong Youzhong, a student in the Department of History at Renmin University of China. Just ten days ago, he was still an ardent supporter of Cheng Haiguo (also known as Lin Xiling), a fourth-year student in the Department of Law at the same university, who unscrupulously spread right-wing remarks everywhere.

When a young man who is keen to seek the truth discovers that what he once mistakenly believed to be the truth was merely a colorless cup of poison, and when the truth truly begins to emit dazzling light before him, how painful and how joyful he must be!

What the reporters are about to narrate in this report is a sharp anti-rightist debate that has taken place at Renmin University of China over the past month or so. Involved in this debate were not only the more than 6,000 students of Renmin University of China, but also representatives from more than 20 universities in the capital.

In a debate attended by more than 6,000 students a few days ago—on the 24th and 25th—Lin Xiling's reactionary remarks, including her political views, dozens of so-called "facts" fabricated, distorted, or exaggerated to prove her views, and various sophistries and techniques used to incite people, were thoroughly destroyed.

You only need to go to Renmin University of China to see those freshly inked big-character posters to know how fierce this debate is and how profound the education it gives to young people is!

The First Gust of Wind
Let us go back to more than a month ago—the evening of May 23, when Lin Xiling publicly delivered her inflammatory speech for the first time on the open-air platform of Peking University.

She said: "Hu Feng's opinions are basically correct. The 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' policy now proposed by the Party is basically the same as what Hu Feng proposed."

"True socialism is very democratic, but we are not democratic here. I call this society socialism based on feudalism."

"We should not think that it is enough for the Communist Party to take a step back towards the people by adopting reformist methods through rectification." "The people are not Adou. The only way to truly solve problems is for the people to take action."

At that time, there was much discussion in the audience, and many students indignantly demanded that she stop speaking and leave the stage. But at the same time, some people supported her and wanted her to continue speaking. They said: "This is a free forum. Those who don't want to listen can leave."

Lin Xiling's fallacies, like a cold wind blowing from the side, immediately attracted the attention of students from Peking University and Renmin University of China.

The Entire Stock
In order to allow Lin Xiling to fully elaborate on her arguments, the Student Union of Renmin University of China organized a free forum. From the end of May to the beginning of June, Lin Xiling gave several consecutive speeches, bringing out all of her political views and theories.

She appeared as a defender of socialism and a person who enthusiastically helped the Party in its rectification, believing that the root of the "Three Evils" should be sought in the existing social system.

She listed certain phenomena in social life, such as cadres being graded when listening to reports and reading documents, and some institutions even grading cadres when issuing furniture, calling this a hierarchy that has penetrated into all aspects of life. She also insisted that personnel systems reflected obvious sectarianism. She said that these specific systems constituted the overall system, and that the existing social system itself produced the "Three Evils." Thus, she put forward the argument that certain parts of China's superstructure were not adapted to the public ownership economic base. Because she could not theoretically explain how socialism produced the "Three Evils," she purposefully said that the social productivity of both the Soviet Union and China was very low, that neither country had eliminated class differences, and especially that both countries implemented the dictatorship of the proletariat; and she cited Engels's theory that socialism could not be built in one country and Lenin's statement that socialism meant the elimination of classes, concluding that today's China and the Soviet Union were not socialist. She declared that she wanted to pursue "true socialism" and advocated reforming the existing social system by explosive means. She also declared that "I do not agree with reformism," but wanted "thorough change."

She slandered the Chinese Communist Party as being composed of a large number of "rascals," a group of people with rigid thinking who were ineffective, and a very small number of true Bolsheviks. She believed that the "rascals" should be purged, that party members who were ineffective should be mobilized to withdraw from the Party, that party members should be admitted with the approval of 70% of the masses, and that party members could be removed from their positions if 50% of the masses agreed.

She used some so-called "facts" to "prove" the expansion of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Taking the so-called "Liang Zhihua incident" as an example, she said that Liang Zhihua, a student at Peking University, opposed Chiang Kai-shek and the United States before liberation, was arrested by the Kuomintang ten times, and was instead persecuted by the government after liberation. She said that the court put Liang in the death row in prison, forced him to commit suicide, and poured chili water into him. Finally, because he had no crime to be convicted of, they insisted that he was mentally ill and sent him to a mental hospital for electrotherapy. She said: "This is very cruel. This matter has not been properly handled to this day. Liang Zhihua is still in the mental hospital outside Deshengmen."

She fabricated rumors that 720,000 people were wrongly accused in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign. She said that there were too many people like "Guo Yuzhi in Fifteen Strings of Cash here."

In addition, she also published many fallacies such as the so-called "limitations of the ruling class," "the people should be dissatisfied with reality," and "there is no freedom of the press in China." She said: The limitations of the ruling class are the rule. She said that last year, when she went from Beijing to Yumen, she "personally" saw workers going on strike along the way, and the Yumen Oilfield Transportation Department also broke out in a "small Hungarian incident." She believed that people should be encouraged to be dissatisfied with reality.

Different Reactions
This series of absurd theories and absurd political views of Lin Xiling were very novel to many young students who lacked political life experience. We know that in May in Beijing, the vast majority of students in various universities had a sincere heart to actively help the Party in its rectification. Although many people disagreed with Lin's views, they believed that "one should say everything one knows and say it without reservation" during the rectification, and that the Party should "correct its mistakes if it has any, and guard against them if it does not." Some students even circulated the erroneous view that one could only talk about the bad and not the good, and could only have criticism and not counter-criticism during the rectification. They did not understand that the right-wingers were spreading reactionary fallacies under the beautiful banner of helping the Party in its rectification. At the same time, Lin Xiling provided "facts" in her speeches that "showed" that there were many shocking dark sides in the Party's work, and inflammatory political slogans that broke this so-called dark side, which made some students think that Lin Xiling was "brave, bold, and able to think independently."

A small number of people were hesitant. They believed some of the "facts" fabricated by Lin Xiling, but they could not understand and felt confused in their hearts. They asked to clarify the facts and distinguish the truth. More people were extremely indignant. They understood that Lin Xiling was spreading fallacies and demanded that the essence of these fallacies be exposed.

Preparing for Counterattack
In the dozens of school buildings of Renmin University of China in Beijing and the western suburbs, students could be seen debating Lin Xiling's arguments everywhere. Even at night, some people were still flipping through relevant books in the library, studying the arguments mentioned by Lin Xiling in her speeches. Some students in the Department of Law who were familiar with Lin Xiling's daily words and deeds carefully verified the so-called "facts" listed by Lin Xiling in her speeches.

The special topic groups, commonly known as free markets, freely organized by students in each class, were even more active. Gu Ying and other eleven students in the Department of Law organized a research group on Lin Xiling's reactionary views. In order to refute Lin Xiling's fallacies such as "over-expansion of confidentiality" and "there is no freedom of the press in China," the Mongolian student Buren and his classmate Huang Ziqin went to the library to read articles on the class nature of newspapers written by Lenin and Kalinin, and re-examined the "Provisional Regulations on the Protection of State Secrets" promulgated by the government.

Completely Defeated
The fierce great debate began. From May 29 to late June, students throughout the school conducted eight large-scale debates on Lin Xiling's right-wing remarks. They refuted Lin Xiling's views and the "facts" she stated from various aspects.

Student Sun Yingtong used the basic principles of Marxism on the base and superstructure to refute a basic argument of Lin Xiling's reactionary remarks—the argument that "China's public ownership base is good, but the superstructure needs fundamental changes." He said: "After the economic base of public ownership is gradually established, if the superstructure deteriorates rapidly in eight years, as Lin said, such as the Party and state organs have become a bureaucratic institution that rules the people and has no democracy, then how can the base of public ownership exist?" "If things are as Lin Xiling said, there can only be two ways out: First, the superstructure seriously hinders the development of the base, and even makes the base tend to collapse. Second, the people rise up to overthrow the superstructure and re-establish a new superstructure that is adapted to the base of public ownership. However, there is no indication of either of these aspects." He said indignantly: "Comrades, according to Lin Xiling's argument, we cannot understand how China's public ownership base was established, how it is maintained, and how it is constantly consolidated." And China's productivity is not stagnant, let alone destroyed. On the contrary, China's productivity is booming forward. The great achievements of economic construction in recent years are the most powerful proof."

Lin Xiling started from finding the root of the "Three Evils" and led to the conclusion that the superstructure and the political system must be reformed. Many students pointed out at the meeting that the root causes of the "Three Evils" are multifaceted, mainly the influence of old ideas on people and the one-sidedness of thinking methods. And these old ideas and old consciousness are the products of the old base and old system. Their existence is precisely a reflection of consciousness lagging behind existence. They said: The facts are just the opposite of Lin Xiling's argument. The Party's rectification movement shows that only the socialist system is the material force to eradicate the "Three Evils," and that the socialist system has great vitality! Lin Xiling's attempt to find the root of the Three Evils from the socialist system is completely wrong.

Ruo Su, a student in the Marxism-Leninism Research Class, pointed out regarding the question of whether socialism can be established in one country that both Engels's theory and Lenin's theory are correct. He quoted the historical conditions under which the two men proposed different theories, explaining that Lenin's theory that socialism could first be victorious in one country has been confirmed by the practice of the international communist movement over the past fifty years.

He said: "Marxism believes that productivity is the factor that ultimately determines the relations of production, but it is not the factor that directly marks the nature of society. What directly determines the nature of society is the base and the superstructure, that is, the basic economic system and political system. If we follow Lin Xiling's theory of productivity, then the United States is socialist!" (Laughter from the audience)

Ruo Su further discussed that there is no socialism without the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said: "If there is still capitalist encirclement or two camps confronting each other externally, and socialist public ownership is established domestically, can the dictatorship of the proletariat be eliminated? Of course not, because international imperialism colludes with domestic counter-revolutionary remnants to try to subvert our country by force at all times, so there is no socialism without the dictatorship of the proletariat." He also said: "In the past, Kautsky and Trotsky used this argument when they opposed Lenin and Stalin. Today, Lin Xiling's misfortune is that she dogmatically copied this opportunist argument."

Everyone was particularly indignant about Lin Xiling's use of the opportunity of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" to defend the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which had long been denounced by the people of the whole country, especially when she insinuated that the Party's "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" policy today was plagiarized from Hu Feng. Xu Zhengfan, a lecturer in the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office, refuted this slander by Lin Xiling. He said that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by the Party is a policy under the guidance of Marxism and aimed at developing socialist culture, while what Hu Feng proposed was to dissolve the unified organization of the literary and art circles, split the unity of writers, and promote the literary and artistic ideas of the bourgeoisie. The result of Hu Feng's conspiracy would only be to divide the literary and art circles, separate them from the leadership of proletarian thought, and create various sects and groups that oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party, opening the door for the dissemination of various bourgeois reactionary ideas.

Xu Zhengfan also criticized Lin Xiling's so-called hierarchy, saying: "Lin Xiling confuses the different levels and positions formed due to people's talents, labor, and division of labor with the hierarchy formed in the past due to people's ownership of the means of production and their different positions in the social production system, as well as the differences in rights and obligations reflected in law. How absurd and ridiculous is this!"

Many of Lin Xiling's absurd arguments, such as "the Party replaces the government," "there is no rule of law in China," "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has been expanded," "the limitations of the ruling class," and "the people should be dissatisfied with reality," were all severely attacked at the debate. Many students pointed out that Lin Xiling's description of the current situation of the Party is a fundamental distortion and malicious slander. Lin Xiling's suggestion to reform the Party through mass elections is actually an attempt to abolish the vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Chinese Communist Party, which is not allowed by the Chinese working class or the people of the whole country. Sun Yingtong, a student in the Department of Journalism, said: There are all kinds of masses, there are advanced masses, and there are backward masses; there are working people, and there are also exploiting class elements who have not yet been reformed. If the Party is reformed according to Lin Xiling's method, the result will be that the Party becomes a big courtyard full of all kinds of masses, a bustling big courtyard where people come and go, and can freely enter from the front door and exit from the back door. He asked: Is this really loving the Party? Or is it trying to fundamentally abolish the Party? Cheng Xiaoxia, a student in the Department of Law, said that because the working class is connected with large-scale social production, and the working class does not have the narrow class interests of the exploiting class, and the Communist Party uses dialectical materialism as its weapon for understanding the world, their limitations in understanding are essentially different from those of other classes.

Zhang Yanzheng, a student in the Department of Law, analyzed the domestic political situation in 1950 and 1955. She said: Without the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1950, the people's regime could not be consolidated. Without the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955, the work of national construction could not be carried out successfully. She loudly questioned, "Lin Xiling fabricated that we wrongly accused 720,000 people in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and also spread the word 'expansion of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries' everywhere. What is the basis for this? Is this helping the Party in its rectification?"

At this time, students sent slips of paper one after another asking Lin Xiling about the source of the so-called 720,000 people wrongly accused in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The very cunning Lin Xiling was speechless at this time. After a long time, she murmured, "Didn't our school wrongly accuse some people? I thought of this from this association." The audience responded with an indignant hiss.

Zhu Zhen, secretary of the principal's office, explained the truth about the investigation of the Liang Zhihua case, which Lin Xiling used to argue that there was no rule of law in China, at the debate. He visited Liang Zhihua himself and the doctor. It turned out that Liang Zhihua was not an anti-Chiang anti-American hero at all, but a mental patient. After liberation, he was temporarily detained and educated by the public security department because he continued to have attacks. The so-called "torture by the court," "forcing him to commit suicide," and "pouring chili water into his nose" were all untrue. But this distorted fact used by Lin Xiling once deceived how many students' excitement and indignation!

Before and after the debate, the students checked the facts in many ways and found that Lin Xiling had this strange ability. She could stare at her eyes and say that something that did not exist seemed to exist, or arbitrarily expand the facts obtained by catching wind and shadows, or replace the whole with one point, thereby deriving principled conclusions. The strike incident she "personally witnessed" was also revealed by two Chinese Youth Daily reporters who were traveling with her. They said: Lin Xiling had been sitting on the train all the way from Beijing to Yumen. How could she see workers going on strike along the way? Lin Xiling had never been to the Yumen Oilfield Transportation Department at all. One reporter wrote: "I stayed in the transportation department for five days and never heard of workers going on strike. Only three junior high school graduates were improperly assigned to work and had emotional problems. They didn't go to work for two days. This may be the small Hungarian incident that Lin Xiling said!"

At the debate, Lin Xiling sometimes evaded everyone's questions, raised questions outside the topic, and then declared that she was joking with everyone. She was impatient to listen to other people's speeches, sometimes flipping through newspapers, sometimes strolling outside the door. When she could not answer the questions raised by the students, she slipped out of the meeting before it was over.

Completely Isolated
A very small number of students who were once confused by Lin Xiling's arguments, especially by the "eerie and terrifying facts" she listed exposing the Communist Party, suddenly felt enlightened as if they had seen the sun.

In the first few debates, there were still some people who supported Lin Xiling to speak on the stage. But later, the number of people who went to the stage to argue for Lin Xiling became increasingly scarce, and finally no one went to the stage.

Tong Jinhuai, a student in the Department of History who had supported Lin Xiling, went to Vice President Nie Zhen the next day after learning the true face of Lin Xiling at a debate one evening and said, "I was wrong."

Student Hong Youzhong, who was mentioned at the beginning of this report, regarded the debate as a rare lesson in life. At a debate on June 17, he painfully told about his experience of being captured by Lin Xiling's remarks and the process of transformation. He said: "The Liang Zhihua case, which Lin Xiling boasted about in vivid terms, once aroused my great anger. I seemed to see that the current prisons were all dark, and I advocated releasing Liang Zhihua... In short, I was confused, began to lose balance, and began to replace reason with impulse..." He said: "Lin Xiling, you have provoked my relationship with the Party, and weakened my love for the Party for a period of time. I cannot but scold you as a villain."

Yes, in this storm, it was not just Hong Youzhong who went astray. However, when the storm passed and the weather cleared, the people who came out of the storm found that they understood and approached each other more.

Exposing the Bottom Line
When the students dissected the truth of Lin Xiling's remarks layer by layer from theory to fact, and when the people who had applauded and applauded her became indifferent to her, this so-called "brave man" suddenly became as changeable and cunning as the color of a lizard's skin.

After the truth of the Liang Zhihua incident was revealed, this example was no longer heard in her speeches. However, she seemed as if she had not lied at all. Lei Fan, who had worked in the Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau, introduced his experience in more than seven years of public security work to the students at a debate, introducing the serious and conscientious work style of the public security department. He said: "At that time, every time we arrested a counter-revolutionary, the masses not only shouted 'Long live the Communist Party, long live Chairman Mao,' but also shouted 'Long live the police station,' because the police station took away the bad guys who had been pressing on their heads for many years." He asked Lin Xiling: "You are speaking for the counter-revolutionaries, why don't you listen to the voice of the masses!" Lin Xiling actually said cunningly: "If the public security organs all over the country are like this, then the world will be peaceful."

The series of absurd arguments put forward by Lin Xiling have become untenable. Slips of paper flew to the rostrum one after another. The students wanted Lin Xiling to answer a common question: In our country, are achievements the main thing or are mistakes the main thing?

Lin Xiling finally had to answer. She said in a drawn-out tone: "If you must ask me to say it, I will also say: achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are secondary," but she immediately added contemptuously: "This is just a dogmatic formula."

At one point, Lin Xiling left the school and lived in the home of right-winger Tan Tiwu for a week. There, she had a long conversation with another right-winger, Huang Shaohong, for several hours.

When she explained these relationships at the meeting, she also attacked Lu Yuwen, who spoke fairly, as a "clown" based on the "materials" provided by Tan Tiwu. She also slandered the current nationwide struggle against right-wingers as an attack by "new right-wingers within the Party" and "current Three Evils elements" against "anti-'Three Evils' activists."

Lin Xiling's supporters, Wu Shurong and Li Qingshi, talked about some of Lin's relationship with Tan Tiwu when they said that Lin Xiling lived in Tan's home, and also invited several of their "believers" to Tan's home. Tan Tiwu talked to them about many issues, and they talked for four hours.

Worthy of Vigilance
In her speeches, she repeatedly said that she supported socialism and helped the Party in its rectification. However, even now, when her anti-socialist fallacies have been thoroughly exposed, she has not abandoned her reactionary arguments. On the 27th, she was still eavesdropping on the meeting of the Communist Youth League members and wrote a big-character poster, scolding those who refuted her reactionary remarks at the debate for using "shameless and incompetent means" to "frame" her.

What does she approve of and what does she pursue? Now let's look at a scene in Lin Xiling's life revealed by Ouyang Zhou, a student at Peking University!

Once, several students from the "Hundred Flowers Society" (a reactionary small group at Peking University) had a heart-to-heart talk in Lin Xiling's dormitory. At that time, Wang Guoqing of the Hundred Flowers Society said:

"We must fight to the end. We can't do without our own publications. The struggle is long-term, arduous, and complex, and the rectification movement is short-term, so..."

Lin Xiling nodded in agreement and said:

"Yes, yes, the Russian revolutionary democrats of the nineteenth century provided us with this experience..."

Wang Guoqing said:

"The publication should be printed in lead type, and more copies should be printed and distributed throughout the country. Light the fire in every corner of the country."

Lin Xiling said nonchalantly:

"I will contact 'Literary Study' and ask them to help with printing, and I will be responsible for distribution."

Readers! This is Lin Xiling. However, among the more than 6,000 students of Renmin University of China, among the nearly 80,000 college students in the capital, and among the more than 400,000 college students across the country, she is so alone, but she is living in our society after all. Shouldn't we think more deeply and be vigilant?

　　毒草识别记
    中国人民大学学生驳倒了林希翎的谬论和谎言
　　新华社记者　郑伯亚　丁宝芳
    受骗者的觉醒
    “一杯有颜色的毒水我决不会喝，然而一杯看来是清亮而无颜色的毒水，我却喝下去了！”
    这是一个受了右派分子的反社会主义言论欺骗的大学生的话。他叫洪有仲，是中国人民大学历史系的学生。就在十天前，他还是肆无忌惮地到处散布右派言论的本校法律系四年级学生程海果（又名林希翎）的狂热的支持者。
    一个热心探求真理的青年，当他一旦发现过去误认为真理的东西原来只是一杯无色的毒水，而真理真正开始在他的面前发出耀目的光彩时，他该是多么沉痛，又是多么欣喜呀！
    记者将要在这篇报道中叙述的是：最近一个多月来发生在中国人民大学里的一场尖锐的反右派分子的大论战。卷入这场论战的不仅有中国人民大学六千多学生，首都二十多个高等学校的学生也先后派了代表参加。
    在几天以前——24日、25日举行的有六千多学生参加的一次辩论会上，林希翎的反动言论，包括她的政治观点，为论证她的观点而捏造、歪曲或夸大的几十件所谓的“事实”，以及为了煽动人心而使用的各种诡辩和手法，都被彻底摧毁了。
    你只要跑到中国人民大学去看看那些墨汁犹新的大字报，你就会知道，这场论战是多么激烈，而它给青年们又是多么深刻的教育！
    第一阵歪风
    让我们回到一个多月以前——5月23日的晚间，林希翎在北京大学的露天讲台上，第一次公开发表了她的煽动性的演讲。
    她说：“胡风的意见基本上是正确的。党现在提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣，同胡风所提的基本一致。”
    “真正的社会主义是很民主的，但我们这里是不民主的，我把这个社会叫做在封建主义基础上产生的社会主义。”
    “我们不要以为共产党用整风的办法，采取改良主义的办法，向人民让点步就够了。”“人民群众不是阿斗。真正要解决问题，只有靠人民群众行动起来。”
    当时，会场上议论纷纭，许多学生愤慨地要求她停止讲话，退出讲台。但同时也有人支持她，要她讲下去。他们说：“这里是自由讲坛，不愿听的可以走开。”
    林希翎的这些谬论，像从斜刺里吹来的一股冷飕飕的风，立刻引起了北京大学、中国人民大学学生们的注意。
    全部货色
    为了让林希翎充分阐述她的论点，中国人民大学学生会组织了自由论坛。从5月底到6月初，林希翎连续进行了好几次演讲，搬出了她的全部政治观点和理论。
    她以社会主义捍卫者和热心帮助党整风的姿态出现，认为：“三害”的根源应从现存的社会制度方面去寻找。
    她罗列了社会生活中的某些现象，如干部听报告、看文件分等级，有的机关给干部发家俱也分等级，她把这称为等级制度，说它已深入到生活的各个方面。她又硬说人事制度里反映着明显的宗派主义。她说这些具体制度组成了总的制度，现存社会制度本身产生了“三害”。从而，她提出了我国上层建筑的某些部分和公有制经济基础不相适应的论点。她因为不能从理论上说明社会主义产生“三害”，就别有用心地说苏联和中国的社会生产力都很低，这两个国家都还没有消灭阶级差别，特别是这两个国家都实行无产阶级专政；并且引用恩格斯所说一国不能建成社会主义的理论，和列宁所说社会主义就是消灭阶级的那句话，得出今天的中国和苏联都不是社会主义的结论。她声言要追求“真正的社会主义”，主张用爆破手段改革现有的社会制度。还声明说“我不赞成改良主义”，而要“彻底变革”。
    她污蔑中国共产党是由一大批“混蛋”，和一批思想僵化而不起作用的人，以及极少数真正的布尔什维克组成。她认为：对“混蛋”应该清洗出去，对不起作用的党员，应该动员他们退党，党员入党要有70％的群众通过，如果50％的群众同意，可以罢免党员。
    她根据一些所谓“事实”来“证明”肃反扩大化。她以所谓“梁质华事件”为例，说北大同学梁质华，在解放前反蒋反美，曾被国民党逮捕了十次，解放后反而遭到政府陷害。说法院把梁放在狱中的死刑房内，逼他自杀，灌辣椒水，最后因为他没有罪名无法判刑，硬说他有精神病而送进精神病院电疗。她说：“这是很惨害人的，这件事一直到现在还未处理好，梁质华还在德胜门外精神病院里。”
    她造谣说在肃反运动中搞错了七十二万人。她说像“十五贯里过于执这样的人在这里太多。”
    此外，她还发表了所谓“统治阶级的局限性”、“人民应该对现实不满”、“中国没有新闻自由”等许多谬论。她说：统治阶级有局限性这个是规律。她说她去年从北京到玉门曾“亲眼”看到沿途工人罢工，玉门油矿运输处还爆发了“小匈牙利事件”。她认为应该鼓励人们对现实不满。
    不同的反应
    林希翎的这一系列荒谬理论和荒谬的政治观点，对于缺乏政治生活经验的许多青年同学来说，是十分新奇的。我们知道，5月的北京，各高等学校的绝大多数的学生，都怀着一颗积极地帮助党整风的善良的心，有不少人虽然不同意林的论点，但认为整风中应该“知无不言，言无不尽”，而党应该“有则改之，无则加勉”，有些同学们中间还流传着一种错误的观点，好像整风时只能讲坏，不能讲好，只能有批评，不能有反批评。他们并不了解右派是在帮助党整风的美丽幌子下传播反动的谬论的。同时，林希翎在讲演中提供了“表明”党的工作中存在着许多令人触目惊心的黑暗面的“事实”，和打破这种所谓黑暗面的煽动性的政治口号，这就使一部分学生认为林希翎“勇敢、大胆，能独立思考”。
    也有少部分人在犹豫。他们听了林希翎捏造的“事实”，有些信以为真，但他们在内心深处不能理解，感到迷惑。他们纷纷要求弄清事实，辨明真相。更多的人是极端愤慨，他们懂得林希翎在散布谬论，要求揭穿这种谬论的实质。
    准备反击
    在北京城内和西郊的中国人民大学的几十处校舍里，到处可以看到同学们就林希翎的论点进行辩论，甚至在晚上，有些人还在图书馆里翻阅有关书籍，研究林希翎在演讲中所提到的论点。一些熟悉林希翎日常言行的法律系学生们，在一起仔细地对证林希翎在演讲中所列举的所谓“事实”。
    由各班级学生自由组合的通常称为自由市场的专题小组更显得十分活跃。法律系顾瑛等十一人组织了林希翎反动观点研究小组，蒙古族学生布仁为了驳斥林希翎的“保密扩大化”，“中国没有新闻自由”等谬论，特地和同学黄子勤等人，一起到图书馆翻阅了列宁、加里宁写的有关报纸阶级性的文章，并重新查阅了政府颁布的“保守国家机密暂行条例”。
    彻底打垮
    激烈的大论战开始了。从5月29日起，一直到6月下旬，全校学生对林希翎的右派言论共进行了八次大规模的辩论。他们针对林希翎的观点和她所说的“事实”，分别从各个方面加以驳斥。
    孙映通同学用马克思主义关于基础与上层建筑的基本原理，驳斥林希翎反动言论的一个基本论点——“我国公有制的基础是好的，但上层建筑需要根本变革”的论点。他说：“在公有制的经济基础逐步建立起来以后，如果上层建筑在八年间很快地变质，如林所说党和国家机关已经变成了一套统治人民、没有民主的官僚机构，那么公有制的基础如何能存在下去呢？”“如果事情竟然像林希翎所说，就只能有两条出路：第一，上层建筑严重阻碍基础的发展，甚至使基础趋于崩溃。第二，人民群众起来推翻上层建筑，重新建立新的适应于公有制基础的上层建筑。然而，这两方面都没有任何象征。”他愤慨地说：“同志们，根据林希翎的论点，我们便无法理解我国的公有制基础怎样建立起来，怎样维持下去和怎样不断巩固的。”而我国的生产力并不是已经停滞不前，更不是被破坏了，恰恰相反，我国的生产力正蓬勃地向前发展。几年来经济建设的伟大成就便是最有力的证明。”
    林希翎是从寻找“三害”的根源，引论到必须变革上层建筑，改革政治制度的。许多同学在会上指出“三害”产生的根源是多方面的，其中主要是旧意识对人们的影响，和思想方法的片面性。而这些旧思想旧意识是旧基础旧制度的产物，它们的存在，正是意识落后于存在的反映。他们说：事实和林希翎的论点恰恰相反，党的整风运动正说明了只有社会主义制度才是根除“三害”的物质力量，说明了社会主义制度具有伟大的生命力！林希翎企图从社会主义制度方面寻找三害的根源，是完全错误的。
    马列主义研究班学生若素就一国能否建立社会主义问题，指出恩格斯理论和列宁理论都是正确的，他引述了两人所提不同理论的历史条件，说明列宁认为社会主义可以首先在一国取得胜利的理论，已为近五十年来国际共产主义运动实践所证实。
    他说：“马克思主义认为生产力是归根结底决定生产关系的因素，但不是直接标志社会性质的因素，直接决定社会性质的是基础与上层建筑，也就是基本的经济制度与政治制度。假如按照林希翎的生产力论来说，那末美国才是社会主义呢！”（台下哄笑）
    若素进而论述了没有无产阶级专政就没有社会主义。他说：“外部还有资本主义包围或者是两个阵营对立，国内建成了社会主义公有制，无产阶级专政能不能灭亡呢？当然不能，因为国际帝国主义勾结国内反革命残余势力时时刻刻在企图用武力来颠覆我们的国家，所以没有无产阶级专政就没有社会主义。”他又说：“过去考茨基和托洛茨基反对列宁、斯大林时曾经用过这个论点，今天林希翎的不幸，就是教条地抄袭了这个机会主义的论点。”
    大家对林希翎利用“鸣”“放”机会，给早为全国人民同声声讨的胡风反革命集团作辩护，特别是她还影射今天党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策是从胡风处剽窃而来，尤为愤慨。马列主义教研室讲师许征帆驳斥了林希翎这种污蔑。他说，党所提出的“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针，是在马克思主义指导下的、以发展社会主义文化为目的的方针，而胡风所提出的却是解散文艺界统一组织、分裂作家的团结、宣传资产阶级的文艺思想的主张，两者绝不能混为一谈。而胡风的那种阴谋实现的结果，不外是使文艺界四分五裂，脱离无产阶级思想领导，制造各种反对社会主义和反对党的领导的宗派与集团，为形形色色的资产阶级反动思想的传播打开方便之门。
    许征帆还批判了林希翎所说的等级制度，他说：“林希翎把由于人们的才能、劳动、分工而形成的不同的级别与职别，和由过去人们由于对生产资料的占有关系与在社会生产体系中的地位的不同，以及由此反映在法律上的权利和义务的区别而形成的等级制度混为一谈，是多么荒唐可笑啊！”
    林希翎的“以党代政”、“我国没有法制”、“肃反扩大化”、“统治阶级的局限性”、“人民应该对现实不满”等许多荒谬论点，都一一在辩论会上受到了痛击。许多同学指出：林希翎所描述的党的现状是根本的歪曲和恶意的诬蔑。林希翎建议的用群众选举来改造党的办法，实际是企图取消中国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党，这是中国工人阶级也是全国人民所不能容许的。新闻系学生孙映通说：有各种各样的群众，有先进的群众，也有落后的群众；有劳动人民，也有尚未改造过来的剥削阶级分子。如果按照林希翎的办法来改造党，结果，党就成了一个充满了各种各样群众的大杂院，一个熙熙攘攘，人们来来往往，可以随便从前门进，后门出的大杂院。他问：这是真正爱护党呢？还是想从根本上取消党呢？法律系学生程晓霞说，由于工人阶级与社会的大生产联系，工人阶级也没有剥削阶级那些狭隘的阶级利益，共产党以辩证唯物主义作为自己认识世界的武器，所以他们认识的局限性比起其他阶级来有本质的区别。
    法律系同学张燕征分析了1950年和1955年国内的政治形势，她说：没有1950年的镇反，人民政权就不能巩固，没有1955年的肃反，国家建设工作就不能胜利进行。她大声责问“林希翎捏造我们在肃反中搞错了七十二万人，还到处宣传‘肃反扩大化’，根据何在？这是在帮助党整风吗？”
    这时同学们纷纷递条质问林希翎所谓肃反中搞错七十二万人的数字的来源。十分狡猾的林希翎这时语塞了，过了好久她才嚅嚅地说：“我们学校不是斗错了一些人吗？我是从这联想到的。”听众们激愤地报以嘘嘘之声。
    校长办公室秘书朱真，在辩论会上说明了林希翎用以论证我国没有法制的梁质华案件调查的真相。他访问了梁质华本人和医生。原来梁质华根本不是什么反蒋反美的英雄人物，而是一个精神病患者，解放后他因为继续发病，被公安部门暂时拘留教养。所谓法院对他“施加酷刑”、“逼他自杀”、“往鼻子里灌辣椒水”等全非事实。但是林希翎利用的这个歪曲了的事实，曾经骗取了多少同学的激动和愤慨啊！
    在辩论会前后，同学们多方查对事实，发现林希翎有这样一种奇异的本领，她能瞪着眼睛把没有的事说得若有其事，或者用捕风捉影得来的事实，任意加以扩大，或者以一点代替全部，从而引伸出原则性的结论。她所“亲自目睹”的罢工事件，也被和她同行的两位中国青年报记者来信揭露了真相。他们说：从北京到玉门，林希翎一直坐在火车上，怎么就看得见沿途工人罢工呢？林希翎也根本没有到过玉门油矿运输处。一位记者写道：“我倒在运输处住了五天，从来没有听说工人什么时候罢过工，只有三个初中毕业生分配工作不恰当，闹情绪，两天没上班，这也许就是林希翎所说的小匈牙利事件吧！”
    在辩论会上，林希翎有时回避大家的问题，提出题外的问题，然后又声明和大家开玩笑。她不耐心听别人的发言，忽而翻看报纸，忽而到门外溜跶，当她对同学们提出的问题无法回答时，就在会还未完就溜出会场了。
    完全孤立
    曾经为林希翎的论点，特别是为她所列举的揭露共产党的“阴森可怕的事实”所迷惑的极少数同学，像突然见了阳光一样，心里豁然开朗了。
    在最初的几次辩论会上，还有一些支持林希翎的人上台讲话。可是后来，到讲台上替林希翎辩论的人日渐稀少，而终于没有一个人上台了。
    支持过林希翎的历史系同学童金怀，在一天晚间的辩论会上，知道了林希翎的真面目后，第二天走到副校长聂真面前说：“我错了。”
    这篇报道一开始所提到的洪有仲同学，把辩论会看成是生活里难得的一课。在6月17日的一次辩论会上，他沉痛地诉说了自己被林希翎的言论俘虏的经过以及转变的过程。他说：“林希翎胡吹得有声有色的梁质华案件，当时曾激起了我极大的忿怒。我似乎看到现在的监狱都是一片黑暗，我主张释放梁质华……总之，我糊涂了，开始失去平衡，开始以冲动代替了理智……”他说：“林希翎，你挑拨了我和党的关系，在一个时期里削弱了我对党的热爱的程度，我不能不骂你是恶棍。”
    是的，在这场暴风雨中，不只是洪有仲误入了迷途。但是，在雨过天晴的时候，从暴风雨中走过来的人，发现他们互相之间是更加谅解，更加靠近了。
    揭穿底子
    当同学们从理论到事实，一层一层的剖开林希翎的言论的真相时，当曾经给她鼓掌叫好的人对她变得冷淡起来的时候，这位所谓
  “勇敢的人”却忽然像蜥蜴的皮肤的颜色一样多变、狡猾起来。
    梁质华事件的真相被揭明以后，在她的演讲中再也听不到这个例子了。但是，她好像自己一点也没有撒过谎似的。　曾经在青岛市公安机关工作的雷凡同学，在一次辩论会上向同学们介绍了他从事七年多公安工作的体会，介绍了公安部门严肃认真的工作作风，他说：“那时候，我们每逮捕一个反革命，群众不仅高呼共产党、毛主席万岁，而且也高呼派出所万岁，因为是派出所为他们带走了多少年来压在他们头上的坏人。”他问林希翎：“你为反革命喊冤，你为什么不听听群众的声音呢！”林希翎竟然狡诈地说：“如果全国的公安机关都是这样，那天下就太平了。”
    林希翎提出的一系列荒谬论点已经站不住脚了。一张张纸条飞上了主席台，同学们要林希翎回答一个共同的问题：在我们的国家里，究竟成绩是主要的，还是错误是主要的？
    林希翎最后不能不回答了，她拉长着声调说：“一定要我说，我也会说：成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”，但是她立刻轻蔑地补充：“这不过是一个教条主义的公式。”
    有一度林希翎离开了学校，到右派分子谭惕吾的家里住了一个星期，她在那里同另一个右派分子黄绍竑长谈了几个钟头。
    她在会上交代这些关系时，还根据谭惕吾供给的“材料”，攻击说公正话的卢郁文是“小丑”。她还诬蔑目前全国人民反右派的斗争是“党内新右派”“现行三害分子”向反“三害”“积极分子”的进攻。
    林希翎的支持者邬淑荣、李庆时两人在说到林和谭惕吾的一些关系的时候曾谈到：林希翎住在谭家时，还约了她们几个“信徒”到谭家去。谭惕吾对她们谈了许多问题，共谈了四小时。
    值得警惕
    演讲中她一再说是拥护社会主义的，帮助党整风的。可是，一直到现在，当她的反社会主义的谬论已经被彻底揭穿的时候，她并没有放弃自己的反动论点。27日，还在偷听共青团员们开会的情况，并写了大字报，谩骂在辩论会上驳她的反动言论的人用“无耻的低能的手段”对她“进行陷害”。
    她到底赞成什么、追求什么呢？现在请看北京大学学生欧阳周所揭发的林希翎生活中的一个场面吧！
    有一次，“百花学社”（北京大学的一个反动小集团）的几个学生在林希翎的宿舍里谈心，当时百花学社的王国卿说：
    “要斗争到底，没有自己的刊物不行，斗争是长期的艰巨的复杂的，而整风运动是短期的，因此……”
    林希翎接着点头说：
    “对，对，十九世纪俄国革命民主主义者给我们提供了这条经验……”
    王国卿说：
    “刊物要铅印才好，要多印些，要发行到全国。把火点到全国每个角落去。”
    林希翎毫不在乎地说：
    “我去找‘文艺学习’联系一下，叫他们帮助印刷，发行由我负责。”
    读者同志们！这就是林希翎。不过，在中国人民大学的六千多学生中，在首都近八万名大学生中，在全国四十多万大学生中间，她是多么孤单，但是她毕竟是生活在我们社会中间的，难道我们不应多深思一下，警惕起来吗？
