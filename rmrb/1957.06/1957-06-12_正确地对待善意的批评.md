　　Our Party has always educated its members to constantly value the criticism of the masses. Recently, in order to carry out the rectification movement, our Party has especially widely solicited criticism from non-Party members. From the central government to various provinces and cities, the Party organizations of various agencies and higher schools have held symposiums or taken other measures to listen to the criticisms and suggestions of non-Party members and the broad masses of staff. Criticism of the Party by non-Party members, and criticism of leaders by general staff members, is actively unfolding throughout the country.
　　Our Party is a party that serves the people. Apart from the interests of the broadest masses of the people, our Party has no, and should not have any, selfish interests. Any shortcomings and errors on our part will cause unfavorable results for the people, and we must resolutely eliminate them. We know that the unshakable trust of the broad masses of the people in our Party is because we can constantly eliminate our own shortcomings and errors and move forward. The opinions of various non-Party sectors on the work of our Party are indispensable mirrors for us, which can often reflect things that we ourselves cannot see for the time being, making it easier for us to improve our work. The more sincerely we listen to the opinions of the non-Party masses and strive to correct our mistakes, the more consolidated the unity between the Party and the masses will be. Precisely because of this, our Party decided to boldly mobilize the masses to criticize the Party when launching the rectification movement.
　　Facts have proved that the Party is doing the right thing. The vast majority of the masses trust and love the Party, and they have put forward many sharp criticisms and positive suggestions to the Party. Judging from the current situation, most of the criticisms of Party organizations and Party members are good, correct, and beneficial to the Party. Indeed, in the name of helping the Party to rectify its work style, some malicious and destructive remarks that are hostile to socialism and the Communist Party have also appeared. A few right-wing elements attempt to lead the criticism of the masses astray, and use the criticism movement to achieve the purpose of weakening the socialist cause, weakening the people's democratic dictatorship, and weakening the leadership of the Party. Therefore, we must resolutely counter the remarks of the right-wingers, so that the criticism of the masses can develop healthily. However, there is no doubt that we must never relax our encouragement and support for all well-intentioned criticisms because of the erroneous remarks of the right-wingers, or because we have conducted counter-criticism against these erroneous remarks. We must never confuse the fundamental boundary between the well-intentioned criticism of the broad masses and the anti-socialist criticism of a few right-wing elements, and especially must not allow certain Party members with low awareness and bad work styles to ignore the criticism of the masses under the pretext of countering right-wing elements, or even retaliate against critics. On the contrary, we must take all necessary steps to continue to encourage and support the criticism of the broad masses, continue to earnestly dispel all their possible misunderstandings and concerns, and resolutely rely on the supervision and assistance of the broad masses to correct mistakes and improve our work. We must not have any wavering on this issue. If this is not the case, it will confuse right and wrong, and the rectification movement will be abandoned halfway, which will just achieve the goals that the right-wingers want to achieve.
　　Is so-called well-intentioned criticism necessarily completely correct? Of course not. Even if the critic's opinions are not completely correct because he does not fully and accurately understand the situation, as long as he puts forward opinions with the active purpose of improving the work, this is at least beneficial to eliminating mutual estrangement. We must strictly distinguish this kind of criticism from the anti-socialist criticism of right-wing elements. Although this kind of criticism is not completely correct, we must still first pay attention to its reasonable aspects and correct parts, and not obliterate it all because it has some errors. However, since this kind of criticism has incorrect aspects, it should also be given necessary explanations or criticisms to the critic at an appropriate time and in an appropriate way, so that the critic can understand the truth and the full picture of the facts.
　　Is it good or bad that the criticism of the masses takes a sharp form? There is nothing wrong with this. We should be good at calmly analyzing this sharp criticism, and not be unbearable or furious because it is sharp. The problem is not in the form but in the substance. Sharp criticism can be completely correct, and mild criticism can be completely wrong. Of course, some critics one-sidedly pursue sharpness, which inevitably makes the criticism one-sided, but as long as this criticism is still fundamentally well-intentioned, then we should still affirm their correct elements, calmly discuss with the critics, and we will definitely be able to achieve mutual understanding and gradually help the critics overcome one-sidedness.
　　As mentioned above, since well-intentioned criticism is sometimes incorrect, and such critics may endorse the remarks of the right-wingers in a short period of time due to their unstable position and incomplete understanding, it is sometimes not easy for people to distinguish between well-intentioned criticism and malicious criticism from right-wing elements. Therefore, in order to distinguish between these two types of criticism, we must adopt a cautious attitude and conduct a comprehensive analysis. We must not only learn to make this distinction ourselves, but also help all well-intentioned critics to draw a clear line with the right-wingers.
　　We have already said that the vast majority of criticisms from the broad masses are correct, or at least partially correct. These criticisms have helped us expose many shortcomings and errors in our work. We should bravely accept all correct criticisms. Whoever does not accept correct criticism for the sake of face or prestige cannot be a true communist. We should unhesitatingly admit those shortcomings and errors that have been correctly pointed out by the masses, and quickly take practical measures to realize all the reasonable demands and suggestions they have put forward. Errors that can be corrected immediately should be corrected immediately, and problems that can be solved immediately should be solved immediately. According to the principle of correcting while rectifying put forward in the Central Committee's instructions on rectification, Party organizations at all levels have accepted criticisms from outside the Party and have begun to solve some problems. But in general, not enough has been done in this regard. After we have begun to counter the anti-socialist remarks of right-wing elements, we should quickly free up our hands to earnestly solve all the problems that need to be solved immediately and can be solved immediately. Of course, it is not easy to figure out whether some criticisms and suggestions are correct at once, or the problems are more complicated and involve a wider range of aspects, so no hasty decisions should be made. This can be explained clearly to the masses and understood by the masses. But the correctness of many criticisms and suggestions is very obvious, and there is no difficulty in accepting these criticisms and realizing these suggestions. For such problems, we must take action immediately to solve them, or at least start to solve them, instead of delaying and prevaricating, letting the shortcomings and errors continue to exist and develop, and letting the precious enthusiasm of the masses to help the Party rectify its work style be frustrated.
　　Although a few right-wing elements want to use their destructive remarks to disrupt our rectification movement, our rectification movement must continue to the end, and the matter of absorbing non-Party masses to help us rectify our work style must also continue to the end. The more resolutely we can accept all well-intentioned and correct criticisms, and the more quickly we can correct our mistakes and improve our work, the more consolidated the unity between the Party and the broad masses will be, and the more isolated the right-wing elements will be. Opposing and isolating a few right-wing elements, while closely uniting with all non-Party people and the broad masses who sincerely criticize our Party, and fighting hand in hand to improve the Party's work and strengthen the socialist cause, is a necessary condition for ensuring the healthy development of our rectification movement.

### 正确地对待善意的批评

　　正确地对待善意的批评
    我们的党从来都教育党员经常重视群众的批评。最近期间，我们的党为了开展整风运动，特别向党外人士广泛地征求批评。从中央到各省市，各机关、各高级学校的党组织都召开了座谈会，或者采取其他各种措施，听取党外人士和广大的工作人员的批评和建议。党外人士对党的批评，一般工作人员对领导人员的批评，正在全国范围内活跃地展开。
    我们的党是为人民服务的党，除了最广大人民的利益以外，我们的党没有、也不应当有任何私利。我们身上的任何缺点和错误都会造成对人民不利的结果，我们必须坚决地加以消除。我们知道，广大人民对我们的党的信任所以毫不动摇，就因为我们能够不断地消除自己身上的缺点和错误而前进。党外各方面对我们党的工作的意见，是我们所不可缺少的镜子，从这里面常常可以反映出有些我们自己一时还看不到的东西，使我们的工作更容易改进。我们愈是虚心听取党外群众的意见，并且努力改正自己的错误，党和群众的团结就能够愈加巩固。正因为这样，我们的党在开展整风运动的时候，决定放手地发动群众对党进行批评。
    事实证明了，党这样做是完全正确的。绝大多数群众对党是信任和热爱的，他们对党提出了很多尖锐的批评和积极的建议。就目前的情况看来，各方面对党组织和党员的批评，绝大部分是好的、正确的、对党有益的。的确，在帮助党整风的名义下，也出现了一些仇视社会主义、仇视共产党的恶意的破坏性的言论。少数右派分子企图把群众的批评引入歧途，利用批评运动达到削弱社会主义事业、削弱人民民主专政、削弱党的领导的目的。因此，我们必须对右派的言论给以坚决的回击，使群众的批评得以健全的发展。但是，毫无疑问，我们绝不能够因为出现了右派的错误言论，因为对于这些错误言论进行了反批评，就放松对于一切善意的批评的鼓励和支持。我们决不能够混淆广大群众的善意的批评同少数右派分子反社会主义的批评之间的根本界限，尤其不能够容许某些觉悟不高、作风不好的党员借口对右派分子的回击，就不理睬群众的批评，甚至对批评者施行打击和报复。相反，我们必须采取一切必要的步骤，继续鼓励和支持广大群众的批评，继续认真地解除他们的一切可能的误解和顾虑，并且坚决依靠广大群众的监督和帮助，改正错误，改进工作。在这个问题上，我们决不能有任何的动摇。如果不是这样，那就会使是非混淆，就会使整风运动半途而废，那就恰好达到了右派分子所希望达到的目的。
    所谓善意的批评，是否必须是完全正确的呢？当然不是如此。批评者即使由于情况了解得不完全，不确切，因而提出的意见不完全正确，但是只要他是本着改进工作的积极目的而提出意见，这至少对于消除相互间的隔阂是有好处的。我们必须把这种批评同右派分子的反社会主义的批评严格地加以区别。这种批评虽然是不完全正确的，但是我们仍然必须首先注意它们的合理的方面和正确的部分，不要因为它们有些错误，就一概加以抹煞。但是，这种批评既然有不正确的方面，也应当在适当时机用适当方法向批评者进行必要的解释或批评，使批评者了解事实的真相和全貌。
    群众的批评采取了尖锐的形式，这好不好呢？这没有什么不好。我们应当善于冷静地分析这种尖锐的批评，不要因为尖锐就受不住，就暴跳如雷。问题不在于形式而在于实质。尖锐的批评可以是完全正确的，温和的批评也可以是完全错误的。当然，有些批评者片面地追求尖锐，不免使批评带了片面性，但是只要这种批评在根本上仍旧是善意的批评，那么我们就仍然应该肯定它们的正确的成分，心平气和地同批评者进行讨论，也一定能够达到相互的理解，并且逐步地帮助批评者克服片面性。
    如上所说，由于善意的批评有时也是不正确的，而且这种批评者由于立场不坚定，认识不全面，甚至会在短促的时间内附和右派的言论，所以人们有时不容易一下子就区别出善意的批评和右派分子的恶意批评。因此，为了区别这两种批评，我们必须采取谨慎态度，进行全面分析。我们不但要自己学会作好这种区别，而且要帮助一切善意的批评者也都学会同右派划清界限。
    我们已经说过，在广大群众的批评中，绝大多数都是正确的，至少是部分地正确的。这些批评帮助我们揭露了我们的工作中的许多缺点和错误。凡是正确的批评，我们都应该勇敢地接受。谁要是为了面子、架子而不接受正确的批评，谁就不能作一个真正的共产主义者。我们应该毫不踌躇地承认那些被群众正确地指出来的缺点和错误，并且迅速采取实际办法来实现他们所提出的一切合理的要求和建议。凡是能够马上改正的错误要马上改正，能够马上解决的问题要马上解决。各级党组织根据中央整风指示中所提出的边整边改的原则，已经接受党外的批评而开始解决了一些问题。但是总的说来，在这一方面做得还很不够。在我们已经开始对右派分子的反社会主义言论进行回击以后，我们应当很快地腾出手来，认真地解决一切需要马上解决、也可以马上解决的问题。当然，也有一部分批评和建议是否正确，一下子不容易弄清楚，或者问题比较复杂，牵涉的方面比较广，不应该轻率地作出决定。这些是完全可以同群众讲清楚，并且得到群众的了解的。但是很多批评和建议的正确性是很明显的，接受这些批评，实现这些建议，并没有什么困难。对于这样的问题，我们一定要马上行动起来，加以解决，至少开始动手去解决，而不要拖延搪塞，让缺点和错误继续存在和发展下去，让群众帮助党整风的宝贵的热情受到挫折。
    少数右派分子尽管想用他们的破坏性的言论来扰乱我们的整风运动，但是我们的整风运动一定要继续进行到底，吸收党外群众帮助我们整风这件事也一定要继续进行到底。我们愈能够坚决地接受一切善意的、正确的批评，愈能够迅速地改正错误，改进工作，党和广大群众的团结也就愈能够巩固，而右派分子也就愈陷于孤立。反对和孤立少数右派分子，同时同一切向我们的党善意地提出批评的党外人士和广大群众紧密地团结在一起，手携手地为改进党的工作、加强社会主义事业而斗争，这是保证我们的整风运动健康地发展的必要条件。
