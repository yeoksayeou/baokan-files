　　Debate on "Flower Patch Jottings" at Tsinghua University
    (Our dispatch) Tsinghua University's free forum held a debate on Huang Wanli's "Flower Patch Jottings" on the 19th and 20th. Many teachers and students participated in the debate.
    At the beginning of the debate, student Pan Changnian said, I am very interested in the road problem raised in "Flower Patch Jottings." To this end, I specifically visited the Beijing Road Engineering Bureau and learned that at the Beijing Municipal People's Congress in August 1956, Deputy Mayor Xue Zizheng inspected the phenomenon of road slurry and pavement cracking in Beijing and took measures. Because many roads had to be repaired, traffic was delayed for a few days. This year, the municipal government held a special meeting to discuss and inspect the causes of road slurry, which shows that our Party and government are very serious about correcting shortcomings, and not as Mr. Huang Wanli slanders. After liberation, the area of newly built roads in Beijing is about three times that before liberation, and the annual construction area is sixteen times that of the Kuomintang rule. Didn't Mr. Huang Wanli see these achievements? It is understood that the phenomenon of road slurry is also very common in capitalist countries, including the United States. In the United States, from 1953 to 1956, 92% of the newly built roads in Michigan had slurry problems. The recent international road conference reflected that roads in various countries have slurry problems, not just China. However, Mr. Huang Wanli attributed this problem to the incompetence of the Communist Party, undemocratic political system, official masters in power, bastards in power, and people being easy to talk to. What is Mr. Huang Wanli's intention in saying these things? It's really puzzling.
    Huang Wanli made two speeches at the debate. He said that he wrote "Flower Patch Jottings" from the standpoint of the people and out of love for the Party.
    Zhang Ren, a professor in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, said that "Flower Patch Jottings" harms unity and is detrimental to socialism. "Flower Patch Jottings" says, "Attempting to cover up everything and seeking only superficial unity is the characteristic of the current regime." He also regards nine-tenths of the people as A Dou. From my personal experience in participating in the Beijing People's Congress for seven or eight years since 1949, it is not like what Mr. Huang Wanli said, only praising and no dissenting opinions. For example, the issue of demolishing the three gates in Beijing caused great controversy. Furthermore, in 1955, Mr. Chen Shihua and Mr. Qian Weichang made sharp criticisms of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Mayor Peng Zhen also said that they were very polite. The Party has never regarded the people as A Dou; the Party has always believed that the people can liberate themselves under the leadership of the Party. Huang Wanli said, "Domestic scholars and people's representatives are all mostly Goethe-Dante poets." Taking Tsinghua as an example, which of the professors who joined the Party does not have real talent and learning? Which one is not as good as Huang Wanli? I think the things done by the People's Government should be praised, and in the past, they were not praised enough.
    Some people also defended Huang Wanli at the meeting. Student Li Hengzhang said that "Flower Patch Jottings" is a novel, and Mr. Huang Wanli should not be measured by the characters in the novel. He believes that this novel has great educational significance. Ouyang Shutang then said that he also believes that the speeches in the novel should not be regarded as the words of Mr. Huang Wanli. He said that the contradictions reflected in the novel can help the Party improve its work, and believes that Huang Wanli wrote the novel from the standpoint of helping the Party. He said that at present, there are also quite a few "Goethe-Dante factions," and they are all hypocritical and do not speak their minds.
    The discussion caused by "Flower Patch Jottings" is also reflected in the wall newspapers. Many students questioned the author.

### 清华园内辩论“花丛小语”

　　清华园内辩论“花丛小语”
    本报讯　清华大学自由论坛在19、20两天，举行了对黄万里的“花丛小语”的辩论会。许多教师和学生都参加了辩论。
    辩论会开始，学生潘昌年说，我对“花丛小语”中所提出的马路问题很感兴趣。为此，我特别访问了北京道路工程局，知道在1956年8月北京市人民代表会议上，薛子正副市长检查了北京道路翻浆、路面龟裂的现象，并采取了措施。由于很多道路要修，因而就耽误了几天的交通。今年市政府又召开专门会议讨论检查马路翻浆的原因，由此可见我们的党和政府对改正缺点是非常认真的，绝不是如黄万里先生污蔑的那样。解放后，北京新建马路面积约为解放前的三倍，每年修建面积为国民党统治时期的十六倍。这些成绩，黄万里先生都没有看到吗？据了解，马路翻浆现象，在资本主义国家也是很普遍的，在美国也是如此。美国密士安州在1953年至1956年间新建的马路中，92％有翻浆现象。不久前召开的国际道路会议上反映，各国马路都有翻浆现象，绝不是中国一个国家才有。而黄万里先生却把这个问题归咎为共产党无能，政治制度不民主，官老爷掌政，王八蛋执政，人民好说话。黄万里先生说这些话用心何在？实在令人难解。
    黄万里在辩论会上发表两次谈话。他说，他是站在人民的立场，从爱护党的立场出发，来写“花丛小语”的。
    水利系教授张任说，“花丛小语”妨害团结，对社会主义不利。“花丛小语”中说，“企图掩盖一切，但求表面统一，就是现政制的特点。”他又把十分之九的人民当作阿斗。从1949年我参加北京人民代表会议，七、八年来的亲身体会，并不像黄万里先生所说的光歌颂，一点反对意见没有。如拆除北京三座门的问题就发生很大的争论。又如1955年陈士骅和钱伟长两先生对市教育局提出尖锐的批评，彭真市长还说提得很客气。党从来没有把人民当作阿斗；党从来相信人民在党的领导下能自己解放自己。黄万里说，“国内的学者和人民代表们都独多歌德——但丁派诗人”。以清华来说，入党的几位教授那一位没有真才实学？那一位不如黄万里？我觉得人民政府做的事应当颂扬，过去还颂扬得不够呢。
    在会上也有人为黄万里辩护。学生李恒章说，“花丛小语”是小说，不能把小说中的人物来衡量黄万里先生。他认为这篇小说有很大的教育意义。欧阳树棠接着说，他也认为不能把小说中的讲话，就认为是黄万里先生的话。他说，小说反映出来的矛盾，可以帮助党改进工作，并认为黄万里是站在帮助党的立场上来写小说的。他说，目前“歌德但丁派”也不在少数，而且都是口是心非，不说心里话。
    “花丛小语”引起的讨论，还表现在墙报上。许多学生对作者提出了质问。
