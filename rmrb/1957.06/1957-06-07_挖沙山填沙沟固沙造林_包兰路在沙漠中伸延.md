    Digging Sand Mountains and Filling Sand Gullies for Sand Fixation and Afforestation
    Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Extends in the Desert
    (Xinhua News Agency) The southern section construction project of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is currently traversing the largest sand mountain along the route. This large sand mountain is located in the eastern part of the Tengger Desert, stretching for seventeen kilometers and reaching an altitude of over 1,300 meters.
    Standing on the high sand mountain now, one can see that a sandbreak barrier several kilometers long has been built along the undulating terrain, and workers are digging sand mountains and filling sand gullies. In some places, the roadbed construction has already been completed. The roadbed is made of yellow sand and covered with colored pebbles. On both sides of the roadbed are platforms more than twenty meters wide, also paved with colorful pebbles. The desert often experiences "black winds" or "yellow winds," and after pressing the stones, the roadbed made of yellow sand will not be blown away by the strong winds. With the platform separating them, the windblown sand particles that fly over the sandbreak barrier will not directly accumulate on the roadbed.
    Outside the sandbreak barrier, the tender green twigs of sand willows and narrow-leaved poplars sway in the wind, while the jujube and locust trees have lush foliage. This method of transplanting trees in the desert is called sand fixation and afforestation. Sand fixation and afforestation can fix the moving desert and is an important part of the desert railway construction project.
    The Tengger Desert is a famous large desert in China, spanning northern Gansu and southwestern Inner Mongolia. The desert is uneven and moves with the strong winds, forming mobile large sand mountains. This is the first time China has built a railway in such a large desert. Although building roads in the desert adds many difficulties, it eliminates the need to build large bridges and tunnels, and the length of the line is shorter than bypassing the desert, which can save the country a large amount of construction investment.

### 挖沙山填沙沟固沙造林  包兰路在沙漠中伸延

    挖沙山填沙沟固沙造林
    包兰路在沙漠中伸延
    据新华社讯　包兰铁路南段建设工程正在穿过沿线最大的一座沙山。这座大沙山在腾格里沙漠的东部，绵延十七公里，海拔一千三百多公尺。
    现在站在高高的沙山上，就可以见到顺着山势的起伏，一垛几公里长的防沙栏已经建筑起来，工人们正在挖沙山，填沙沟。有的地方路基工程已经做好。路基是用黄沙堆成，外面压上彩色的卵石。路基两边是二十多公尺宽的平台，也铺上了五彩卵石。沙漠上时常刮起“黑风”或“黄风”，压上石子以后，黄沙筑成的路基就不会给大风刮跑。有了平台相隔，飞越防沙栏的风沙子也不致直接堆积到路基上。
    防沙栏的外边，沙柳、小叶杨的嫩绿细枝迎风摇摆，沙枣、槐树枝叶茂盛。这样把树木移植在沙漠上，称做固沙造林。固沙造林可以使移动的沙漠固定下来，是沙漠铁路建设工程重要的组成部分。
    腾格里沙漠是我国有名的大沙漠，横跨在甘肃北部和内蒙古的西南部。沙漠起伏不平，随着巨风移动，形成一座座流动性的大沙山。我国在这样大的沙漠上建设铁路，这还是第一次。在沙漠上筑路虽然增加了许多困难，但是用不到修建大桥和隧道，线路长度也比绕过沙漠的为短，因此可为国家节省大量建设投资。（附图片）
