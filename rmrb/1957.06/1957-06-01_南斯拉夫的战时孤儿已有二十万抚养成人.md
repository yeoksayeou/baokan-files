    Yugoslavia's War Orphans, 200,000 Strong, Have Grown Up
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Thanks to the care of the Yugoslav people's government and the entire society, the Yugoslav orphans left behind by the Second World War are growing and developing into citizens with independent living skills. Yugoslavia sacrificed 1.7 million people in the last war, and more than 300,000 children lost their fathers, mothers, or both parents. After the war, the care and upbringing of these orphans became a matter of concern for the entire country and society.
    So far, 200,000 orphans have been raised to adulthood and have begun independent lives. There are currently 100,600 orphans under the age of 18. Some are studying in various schools, and some are mastering the skills of various trades.
    The responsibility for raising wartime orphans mainly rests with the People's Committees of cities and districts throughout the country. They all have a special fund specifically for raising orphans. In 1956, 1.3 billion dinars were allocated for this purpose. In addition, the Yugoslav Federal Government and social insurance institutions also allocated 1.5 billion dinars to educate orphans.
    This year, the People's Committees of Yugoslav cities and districts will use the same amount of funds as last year to raise wartime orphans, and the Federal Government will also allocate a total of 1 billion dinars for this purpose. (Attached picture)

    南斯拉夫的战时孤儿已有二十万抚养成人
    本报讯　第二次世界大战中遗留下来的南斯拉夫孤儿，在南斯拉夫人民政权和整个社会的关怀下，正在成长发展为具有独立生活能力的公民。南斯拉夫在上次大战中曾经牺牲了一百七十万人，有三十多万儿童失去了自己的父亲、母亲或双亲。战后，对于这些孤儿的抚养和培育，就成为整个国家和社会所关心的事情。
    到现在为止，已经有二十万名孤儿被抚养成人，开始了独立的生活。目前在十八岁以下的孤儿还有十万零六千人。他们有的在各种学校中学习，有的正在掌握各种行业的手艺。
    对于战时孤儿的抚育责任，主要是由全国各地的市和区的人民委员会担负。它们都设有一笔专门用来抚育孤儿的特别基金。在1956年，为了这个目的而拨付了一十三亿第纳尔的经费。另外，南斯拉夫联邦政府和社会保险机构还拨付了一十五亿第纳尔来作为教育孤儿的经费。
    今年，南斯拉夫各市区人民委员会将用相当于去年的经费来抚育战时孤儿，联邦政府为此目的也将拨付总额为一十亿第纳尔的款项。（附图片）
