Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, May 31st, TASS Dispatch: Dubi, a member of the Central Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party, delivered a report on the revision of the Party Constitution at the 13th Congress of the Israeli Communist Party on May 30th.

    He said that the purpose of the proposed revisions to the Party Constitution submitted to the Congress is to strengthen democratic centralism, further develop criticism and self-criticism, prevent any factional activities within the Party, and improve the overall organizational work of the Party.

    Dubi pointed out that during the past sixteen months, in-depth discussions have been held within the Party on issues raised by the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the relationship between Arab and Israeli relations, the Jewish question, and the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, among others.

    Following Dubi's report, the Congress began discussing the summary report of the Central Committee of the Israeli Communist Party and the report on the revision of the Party Constitution.

    Political Bureau member Habibi, in his speech during the discussion, pointed out that the Israeli Communist Party has gained the support of the Arab residents of Israel. The policies put forward by the Israeli Communist Party can lead to peace between Israel and Arab countries. The attempts by other chauvinistic parties in Israel to find support among the Arab residents of Israel have failed. This failure decisively proves that the policies implemented by these parties can only isolate Israel in the Arab East and deepen the gap between Arabs and Jews. Their policies have already led to the aggression against Egypt and the massacre of peaceful Arab residents of Kfar Qasim. Habibi denounced the policy of national oppression against the Arab residents of Israel implemented by the Ben-Gurion government.

    The Congress read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    Pam Dutt, a representative of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

    加强民主集中制　改善党组织工作
    以共代表大会讨论修改党章
    据新华社31日讯　塔斯社特拉维夫31日讯：以色列共产党中央政治局委员杜比5月30日在以色列共产党第十三次代表大会上做了修改党章的报告。
    他说，向大会提出的对党章的修改，目的是要加强民主集中制，进一步开展批评和自我批评，防止党内任何派别活动和改善整个党的组织工作。
    杜比指出，在最近十六个月期间，对苏共第二十次代表大会所提出的问题，阿拉伯和以色列关系问题，犹太人问题以及匈牙利的反革命暴动等等问题在党内进行了深入的讨论。
    在杜比报告结束后，大会始开讨论以色列共产党中央委员会的总结报告和关于修改党章的报告。
    政治局委员哈比比在讨论中发言时指出，以色列共产党得到了以色列的阿拉伯居民的支持。以色列共产党提出的政策能够导致以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的和平。以色列的其他充满沙文主义精神的政党，企图在以色列的阿拉伯居民中间找到支持的企图失败了，这种失败确凿地证明：这些政党实行的政策只能使以色列在阿拉伯东方孤立起来，使阿拉伯人和犹太人之间的鸿沟更深。它们的政策已经引起对埃及的侵略和造成了对克法卡塞姆的阿拉伯和平居民的大屠杀。哈比比痛斥本—古里安政府所实行的对以色列的阿拉伯居民进行民族压迫的政策。
    代表大会宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    英国共产党代表帕姆·杜德在会上致了贺词。
