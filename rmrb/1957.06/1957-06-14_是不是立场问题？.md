Title: Is it a Matter of Stance?

　　In the current rectification movement, everyone can see a significant phenomenon: people's views on the same thing are often very different, even completely opposite. What is going on?

　　We believe that there can be many reasons for this, but the most important one is due to people's different stances.

　　Some people say, now that we are dealing with contradictions among the people, why bring up the issue of stance again?

　　We believe that dealing with contradictions among the people does not exclude the issue of stance. In our country at the present time, there are still different classes among the people. Although members of the bourgeoisie are transforming into laborers, and the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie have joined cooperative organizations, the ideological influence of these two classes will still exist for a long time. Raising the issue of stance and understanding the essence of each other's thinking are necessary conditions for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Otherwise, how can we achieve true unity if we haven't even clarified each other's stances?

　　Our country is building socialism. In the process of building socialism, the original members of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will eventually be transformed into workers and collective farmers (including their intellectuals). This is the only direction forward. Only by moving in this direction can we achieve ideological unity. Of course, it takes time for the original members of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie to completely shift to a socialist stance, but without this stance, it is impossible to achieve ideological unity, and thus impossible to correctly handle the contradictions between the new and old stances within the people.

　　In the formula of "unity – criticism – unity," unity must have a standard, and criticism must also have a standard. The fundamental standard is socialism. Without criticizing from a socialist stance, it is impossible to achieve unity on a socialist basis.

　　Some people say that intellectuals have made great progress in the past few years, but many people underestimate this fact. We believe that this situation does exist, and many Communist Party members have made mistakes in this regard and must be corrected. But at the same time, many intellectuals overestimate their own progress. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain the many ideological confusions in the current rectification movement.

　　For example, in our country's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, is achievement the main aspect? This should not have been a problem, because the victory of the democratic revolution, the victory of the socialist revolution, and the victory of socialist construction are the results of the struggle and labor of hundreds of millions of people across the country, and are objective facts that do not depend on people's will. The foundation of the socialist society established by the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, and the socialist economic and cultural and educational undertakings developed by the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, despite various local shortcomings and errors, have enabled the motherland to make rapid progress and fundamentally changed the face of the motherland. However, this very fact has become a problem for many intellectuals at present. In political circles, the press, education, literature and art, science and technology, and among people in industry and commerce, and among young students, there are some people (including a small number of Communist Youth League members and Communist Party members) who have doubts about this. In some places, under the instigation of certain people, an atmosphere has even been created that forbids others from saying that achievement is the main aspect; anyone who says so is committing the crime of dogmatism and Party jargon.

　　Why is this phenomenon happening? Is there an issue of stance here?

　　We believe that whether achievement is the main aspect or not is a fundamental question worth discussing. We suggest that all sectors of society across the country debate this fundamental question. Because acknowledging the existence of shortcomings and errors is not a problem now. The task of the rectification movement is to mobilize the strength of the entire Party and even the entire country to fight against these shortcomings and errors. On the contrary, denying achievements has now become a fundamental problem. Because if we believe that the socialist revolution and socialist construction are fundamentally wrong and have failed, people will face a dark future, New China will be in darkness, and socialism, Marxism, and the Communist Party will be in darkness. If this is the case, then the problem is not rectification at all, but to destroy the people's socialist cause, destroy the people's confidence, and destroy the nation's confidence.

　　Is this our alarmist talk? Everyone, please see, isn't this kind of chaos already created within the scope of influence of the evil wind that does not allow people to say "achievement is the main aspect"?

　　Creating temporary chaos is nothing to be afraid of. Because the objective facts cannot be overturned by any sophistry. Those rightists who were originally firmly opposed to socialism are now showing their true colors in front of the masses by deliberately creating this chaos, which is certainly not a bad thing. Those who are temporarily caught in the chaos will eventually return to the side of truth after a period of ideological struggle, which is also not a bad thing. But in any case, for these people, such a period of ideological confusion can hardly be said to be a profound lesson.

　　The great intellectuals who can see the tip of an autumn hair not only fail to see a load of firewood, but also fail to see the earth-shaking historical changes, and must wait for ordinary workers and peasants to correct them. If such a person's stance is not fundamentally wrong, at least it is not firm, right?

　　One lesson cannot ultimately solve the issue of stance. People will need many more lessons to finally complete the transformation of their stance, especially if they always think the problem has already been solved. But one lesson is still a lesson. This also shows how indispensable this current debate is, even though some people feel uncomfortable for the time being.

### 是不是立场问题？

　　是不是立场问题？
    在当前的整风运动中，大家都可以看到一个显著的现象，就是对于同样一件事，人们的看法往往很不相同，甚至完全相反。这是怎么一回事呢？
    我们认为，这可以有好些原因，但是最重要的，是由于人们的立场不同。
    有的人说，现在是处理人民内部的矛盾，为什么又提出立场问题来呢？
    我们认为，处理人民内部的矛盾，并不排除立场问题。在我国目前时期，人民内部还是有不同的阶级。资产阶级的成员虽然正在向劳动者转化，小资产阶级的绝大部分虽然已经参加了合作组织，但是这两个阶级的思想影响都还将在长时期内存在。提出立场问题，了解各自的思想实质，正是正确处理人民内部矛盾的一个必要条件。否则，连彼此的立场都还没有弄清，怎么能求得真正的团结呢？
    我们的国家正在建设社会主义。在建设社会主义的过程中，原来的资产阶级和小资产阶级的成员，都将最后转化为工人和集体农民（包括他们的知识分子）。这是唯一的前进的方向。只有大家朝着这个方向前进，才能在思想上达到一致。当然，要原来的资产阶级和小资产阶级的成员完全转入社会主义的立场是需要时间的，但是离开这个立场，却无法求得思想的一致，也就无法正确处理人民内部的新立场和旧立场之间的矛盾。
    在“团结——批评——团结”这个公式中，团结要有一个标准，批评也要有一个标准。根本的标准，就是社会主义。不从社会主义的立场进行批评，也就不会达到在社会主义基础上的团结。
    有人说，知识分子在过去几年中已经有了巨大的进步，而许多人却对于这个事实估计不足。我们认为，这个情况确是有的，在这个方面许多共产党员犯了错误，必须加以纠正。但是同时也有许多知识分子对于自己的进步估计过高。如果不然，就无法解释目前整风运动中的许多思想混乱了。
    举一个例。在我国的民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，成绩究竟是不是主要的？这本来是不应该成为问题的，因为民主革命的胜利、社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的胜利，是经过全国亿万人民奋斗和劳动得来的结果，是不依人们的意志为转移的客观存在的事实。全国人民共同努力所建立的社会主义社会的基础，全国人民共同努力所发展的社会主义经济事业和社会主义文化教育事业，尽管有种种局部性质的缺点和错误，但是它们已经使祖国获得了迅速的进步，根本上改变了祖国的面貌。然而正是这个事实，在目前的许多知识分子中居然成为问题。在政治界、新闻界、教育界、文学艺术界、科学技术界、工商界的人士中，在青年学生中，都有一部分人（其中也包括很少数共青团员和共产党员）对于这一点发生了怀疑。在有些地方，在某些人的煽动下，竟至造成一种空气，不许别人说成绩是主要的，谁说了谁就是犯了教条主义和党八股的大罪。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？这里是不是有一个立场问题呢？
    我们认为，成绩究竟是不是主要的，这是值得展开讨论的一个根本问题。我们建议全国各界都来辩论一下这个根本问题。因为承认缺点和错误的存在，现在并不成为问题。整风运动的任务，正是要动员全党以至全国人民的力量，同这些缺点和错误作斗争。倒是否认成绩，现在成了一个根本问题。因为如果认为社会主义革命和社会主义建设基本上是错误的，失败的，人们的面前就会是一片黑暗，新中国就会是一片黑暗，社会主义、马克思主义和共产党就会是一片黑暗。如果是这样，那么问题就根本不是整风，而是要毁灭人民的社会主义事业，毁灭人民的信心和民族的信心。
    这是我们的危言耸听么？大家请看，凡在不许人们说“成绩是主要的”这样一阵歪风的影响所及的范围内，难道不是已经造成了这样一种混乱么？
    造成一时的混乱，并没有什么可怕。因为客观存在的事实，毕竟不是任何诡辩所能驳倒的。那些本来是坚决反对社会主义的右派分子，现在由于故意制造这种混乱而在群众面前显出了自己的本来面目，这当然没有什么不好。那些一时陷入混乱的人们，经过了一番思想上的斗争而终于回到真理这一方面来，这也没有什么不好。但是无论如何，对于这些人们说来，这样一阵思想混乱，却很难不说是一次深刻的教训。
    明察秋毫之末的大知识分子，不但不见舆薪，而且看不见天翻地复的历史变化，却要等待普通的工人农民来纠正他。这样的人，立场如果不是根本错误，至少也是没有站稳吧？
    一次教训并不能最终地解决立场问题。人们为了最终地完成立场的转变，还会需要好多次教训，特别是如果他们老是以为问题早已解决了的话。但是一次教训到底是一次教训。这也就说明了，目前的这一场争论，尽管有些人暂时觉得浑身不舒服，却是多么必不可少。
