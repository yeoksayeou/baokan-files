Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 27th: Old peasants, old revolutionaries, and families of martyrs in the old revolutionary base area of Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, which recently suffered from flooding, have been gathering to refute the bourgeois right-wingers' anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership rhetoric.

Many farmers used their recent experiences fighting the flood to illustrate their firm support for the Party's leadership. Su Quan, a member of the Taidong Township Agricultural Cooperative Committee, said at a symposium, "Our Taidong Township suffered two floods in May. Ten out of the twelve villages in the township were flooded, making it the most severely affected township in the county. The thirty-eight Party members and cadres in our district, township, and cooperative were all intensely involved in the rescue work. The county also sent cadres to help and lead the rescue efforts. As a result, the lives of all 467 households in the township were safe. After the disaster, the government quickly issued over 10,000 yuan in relief funds and loans to provide relief and help restore production, with relief funds alone equivalent to 40% of the township's annual agricultural tax. However, in 1943, this area suffered a drought for more than two months, resulting in crop failure. More than 270 people in the township starved to death or fled to other places, and eight families were scattered and destroyed. At that time, the reactionary government not only provided no relief but also demanded grain and money, and the landlords were even more ruthless in collecting rent. Now, without the leadership of the Communist Party in this flood, we don't know what would have happened to us."

Li Daoshi, a staff member of the Haifeng County People's Committee's Agricultural Science Department, said that the flood in Haifeng County this May broke historical records, with rainfall reaching more than 1,300 millimeters in just over ten days. 80% of the county's townships were affected, and 30% of the crops were damaged. Thousands of Party and government cadres were involved in the rescue work, and Youth League member Chen Xing gloriously sacrificed his life. After the disaster, the government actively supported the masses in production and famine relief with financial and material resources. Now, a month has passed, and no one has starved to death. He also said that Haifeng's production conditions are very poor, and it has historically suffered from floods and infertile land. Since liberation, there have been constant disasters, but production has developed. This year, the unit area yield of rice increased by 24% compared to 1952. This is the result of the Communist Party leading farmers to develop production. The bourgeois right-wingers want to deny the great achievements of the Party; let them come to Haifeng and see for themselves!

Lai Mu, an old peasant woman from Lianhe Township, recounted the story of how the national cadre and Youth League member Chen Xing sacrificed himself to save her in the flood. She said, "When the flood inundated the village on the morning of May 23rd, almost everyone in the village had left, but I hadn't left because I had something to do. When Chen Xing found out, he and a demobilized soldier rowed a raft to my door and urged me to leave quickly. I saw that he was drenched in the heavy rain, cold and hungry. Later, I heard that he hadn't slept for several nights because he was busy with disaster relief work in the township. I got on his raft and left. I didn't expect that as soon as I got ashore, he fell into the river and drowned. Such a young man of twenty-three sacrificed himself to save me, an old woman of sixty-one. This is a good cadre cultivated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" She said while wiping away her tears, "Chen Xing saved me, and later the government also gave my family relief funds. In the days of the Kuomintang, there would never have been such a good thing! Now, some people are even scolding the Communist Party and cadres. I don't know what kind of hearts these people have?"

　　海丰怎样战胜了洪水？
　　全靠党的领导、政府的帮助、党员和干部带领群众抢救、团员甚至舍身救人
    新华社广州27日电　刚刚遭受过水灾的革命老根据地——广东省海丰县的老农民、老革命人员、烈属，最近纷纷集会驳斥资产阶级右派分子的反对社会主义、反对党的领导的言论。
    许多农民都以最近跟洪水作斗争的事例来说明他们坚决拥护党的领导。台东乡农业社社委苏泉在一次座谈会上说，我们台东乡在5月间受到两次水灾，全乡十二个村有十个村被淹，是全县的重灾乡。我们区、乡、社里的三十八个党员和干部都紧张地投入这次抢救工作。县里也派干部来帮助和领导抢救。结果使全乡四百六十七户人的生命都安全无事。灾后，政府很快又发下救济款和贷款等一万多元进行救济和帮助恢复生产工作，其中光救济款项就相当于全乡一年农业税的40％。可是在1943年的时候，这里受旱两个多月，农作物失收，全乡就有二百七十多人饿死和出外逃荒，有八户家散人亡。那时反动政府不但没有救济，还来要粮要钱，地主们追租更凶。现在这次水灾，如果没有共产党的领导，我们还不知怎样呢？
    海丰县人民委员会农业科工作人员李道实说，今年5月海丰县的洪水打破了历史纪录，在十多天内暴雨达一千三百多公厘，全县有80％的乡受灾，有30％的农作物受到损失。几千个党政干部投入抢救工作，共青团员陈兴还光荣地献了生命。受灾后，政府还在财力和物力上积极支援群众生产度荒，现在已经过了一个月，没有饿死一个人。他又说，海丰的生产条件很不好，历史上一直闹水灾，土地贫瘠。解放后，也不断有灾害，但生产却发展了，今年水稻单位面积产量就比1952年提高24％。这都是共产党领导农民发展生产的结果。资产阶级右派分子想否认党的伟大工作成绩，叫他来海丰看看吧！
    联河乡老农妇赖姆叙述国家干部、共青团员陈兴在洪水中舍身救她的经过时说，5月23日上午洪水浸到村里来时，村上的人差不多都走了，我因有事还没有离开。陈兴知道后，和一个复员军人划着木排找上门来，劝我快走，我看见他冒着大雨来满身是水，又冻又饿。后来听说他因为在乡里忙着搞受灾的救济工作，已经有几夜没有睡着过。我坐着他的木排走了。想不到我刚上岸，他就跌落河里淹死了，这样一个二十三岁的青年人，为着救我这个六十一岁的老太婆却牺牲了。这是共产党毛主席培养出来的好干部！她一边抹着眼泪一边说，陈兴救了我，后来政府还给我家里发下救济款。在国民党的时候，那会有这样好的事情呵！现在竟还会有人骂共产党和干部不好，不知这些人是什么心肠？
