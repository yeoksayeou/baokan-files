CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee
Invites Democratic Figures from All Ethnic Groups for Rectification Forum

Urumqi, June 2nd (reported by this newspaper) – The CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee began holding forums on the afternoon of May 31st, inviting democratic figures from all ethnic groups. The forums were presided over by Wang Enmao, First Secretary, and Saifudin, Secretary. Comrade Wang Enmao sincerely solicited criticisms and opinions on the Party Committee to help the Party carry out rectification. At the meeting, Yu Mingyu, chief engineer and steelmaking expert of the Bayi Steel Plant, said: Sectarianism is not only manifested between the Party and non-Party members, but there is also a kind of sectarianism centered on a few people, which makes the wisdom and strength of the masses suffer even more. This should be said to be small sectarianism within big sectarianism. Big sectarianism must be rectified, and small sectarianism must also be rectified. Yu Mingyu believes that bureaucratic practices in management will lead to a large organization and bloated institutions. In some factories, non-production personnel account for 36% of the total number of employees, which means that one cadre cannot even manage two people. This makes the price of finished products very high, and industrial production cannot develop. Yu Mingyu suggested that after the rectification, some systems must be established to prevent leaders from making the mistakes of the three major isms again.

Some Cadres Have Poor Work Styles
Hope Leaders Strengthen Education
Hu Saiyin·Mulatov, Director of the Autonomous Region Grain Bureau, talked about the relationship between cadres and the masses. He said: Since liberation, under the direct leadership of the Communist Party, especially the Autonomous Region Party Committee, many ethnic minority cadres have been cultivated and placed in appropriate positions, giving previously oppressed ethnic minority cadres the opportunity to serve their own ethnic groups, which is gratifying. However, there are also unhealthy phenomena. He criticized some cadres who do not serve the people but act as overlords of the masses, especially some young cadres, who are simply like old officials. They beat the masses, scold the masses, and have a very bad relationship with the masses. The masses are very afraid in front of these cadres and dare not tell them their innermost thoughts. There is an old saying: "Soft words can turn stone into water." This means that only through correct methods can good results be achieved in work. Now some cadres do not pay attention to working methods, and some cadres even have very bad work styles. Originally, cadres are the specific implementers of the Party and government policies. He hopes that in the future, when equipping and promoting cadres, attention should be paid to political conditions and moral character. He feels that in the past, only attention was paid to whether the person being trained or promoted was a Party member, while insufficient attention was paid to his connection with the masses and working methods. He hopes the leadership will correct this.

Regarding the issue of respecting the powers of ethnic minority cadres, he said, "I feel that I not only have power and authority in the Grain Bureau, but also have a good relationship with the Party member comrades in charge. The problem that exists is that there are currently insufficient ethnic minority cadres equipped while there are too many Han cadres. I once wanted to raise this issue, but I was afraid of being labeled as a local nationalist and did not raise it. Now I raise it, I think the problem of a small number of ethnic minority cadres in some units should be resolved."

Maihemaitijiang·Maihesumu, Deputy Director of the CPPCC Autonomous Region Committee, said: "I am much more passive now than in the past, and I am less courageous to offer opinions. The reason is that I used to offer many opinions to the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee and relevant leading comrades regarding the work of the CPPCC, but I have not received a reply for a long time, so I dare not offer opinions anymore." He said, "I believe that the task of the CPPCC should be to help the People's Committee carry out its work and to regularly reflect the opinions and demands of the people, but the Autonomous Region CPPCC has not been able to complete this task well, and has not gone deep into the masses or contacted the masses, but this responsibility cannot be completely blamed on us, the main responsibility should be borne by the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee. Because when we encounter difficulties in our work and look for the relevant comrades in charge of the United Front Work Department to solve them, sometimes we can't find them for a month, so of course the work cannot be done well. In 1956, more than 60 proposals from the People's Congress had not been dealt with. These proposals were all reasonable demands of the people, and the People's Representatives often urged them, but there was no answer. Of course, we also have bureaucratic tendencies. Therefore, the masses believe that the CPPCC cannot solve their problems, so contradictions have arisen between the masses and the CPPCC. CPPCC members no longer offer opinions because they see that problems cannot be solved."

Earnestly Overcome Han Chauvinism and Give Play to the Role of Ethnic Minority Cadres
Majiti·Akemaolaefu, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department, also said: "After the establishment of the Autonomous Region, many local ethnic minority cadres were promoted, especially a part of local ethnic minority leading cadres, which is very good. However, in the promotion, only political conditions were paid attention to, and conditions such as working ability were not paid attention to. At the same time, after ethnic minority leading cadres were sent, because there were no ethnic minority cadres below, the ethnic minority leading cadres were actually 'empty commanders,' and had to assign work to Han cadres. However, in the work, the phenomenon of Han cadres only accepting tasks but not performing them was encountered. This affected the work mood of ethnic minority leading cadres. Of course, this is not to say that all Han cadres below have Han chauvinistic ideas, but some Han cadres do have Han chauvinistic ideas. Ethnic minority leading cadres are not comfortable talking about these issues, fearing that if they speak up, they will not be listened to. I suggest that ethnicization be truly realized to change this situation."

"In addition, I feel that the Autonomous Region Personnel Bureau has not shouldered its own task. The cadres are not strong, they do not know which organs lack what cadres, and of course they do not know what kind of cadres to send. The cadres sent are also not very popular. I hope to strengthen the work of the Personnel Bureau so that it can shoulder its own task."

Mijiti said: "Regarding the issue of very few ethnic minority cadres in the Water Conservancy Department, I have raised opinions many times but they have been useless. Last year, the Autonomous Region established many hydrological stations, which are suitable for ethnic minority cadres to work in, but most of the cadres equipped were Han cadres. I raised an opinion hoping to increase ethnic minority cadres, but because the Director disagreed, my opinion did not play a role. I think the Water Conservancy Department does not pay attention to cultivating ethnic minority cadres. For example, the original Water Conservancy Department planned to run four schools to train local ethnic minority water conservancy technical cadres, but later it was decided to run one, which only recruits 2,000 people. I think this number is too small, because Han cadres have many difficulties in their work. For example, some cadres we send down cannot work due to language barriers and can only help farmers pull weeds."

Wen Feiran, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs of Xinjiang College, Xu Tianyi, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs of Xinjiang Medical College, Wang Shouting, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department, and others also spoke at this forum. The forum will continue to be held.

### 中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会  邀集各族各界民主人士座谈整风

    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会
    邀集各族各界民主人士座谈整风
    本报乌鲁木齐2日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会于5月31日下午开始邀集各族各界民主人士举行座谈，座谈会由第一书记王恩茂、书记赛福鼎主持，王恩茂同志诚恳地征求对党委的批评和意见，帮助党进行整风。会上，八一钢铁厂总工程师、炼钢专家余铭钰说：宗派主义不仅表现在党与非党之间，而且还有一种以少数人为中心的宗派主义，使发挥群众的智慧和力量更受损失。这应该说是大宗派主义之中还有小宗派主义。大宗派主义固然要整，而小宗派主义也要整。余铭钰认为，在经营管理上的官僚主义会使组织庞大，机构臃肿，有些厂里非生产人员占了全厂人数36％，也就是说一个干部还管不到两个人。这样就使成品价钱很高，工业生产无法发展。余铭钰建议整风后必须建立一些制度，来防止领导人不再犯三大主义的错误。
  有些干部作风不好
  希望领导上加强教育
    自治区粮食厅厅长胡赛音·木拉托夫谈到干部和群众的关系问题，他说：解放几年来，在共产党特别是自治区党委的直接领导下，培养了许多民族干部，都安置到了适当工作岗位上，使过去受压迫的少数民族干部有了为本民族服务的机会，这是值得高兴的。但是，也有不健康的现象。他批评有些干部不是为人民服务，而是群众的老爷，特别是一些年轻的干部，简直像个旧官吏。打群众，骂群众，和群众的关系搞的很坏，群众在这些干部的面前，非常恐惧，当然不敢向他们讲知心话。古人有句话：“软话能把石头化成水”。这个话是说，工作中，只有通过正确的方法，才能有好的效果。现在有些干部却不注意工作方法，有些干部甚至作风非常恶劣。本来，干部是党和政府政策的具体执行者。他希望今后配备、提拔干部时，应注意政治条件和道德品质。他觉得过去只注意了被培养或提拔者是否是党员，而对他与群众的联系、工作方法等则注意不够。这一点希望领导上纠正。
    关于尊重民族干部职权的问题，他说，我觉得我在粮食厅不但有职有权，和党员负责同志的关系也很好。存在的问题是，目前，配备的民族干部不足而汉族干部却多，对此我曾想提意见，但怕戴地方民族主义的帽子而没有提。现在我提出来，我以为有些单位民族干部少的问题是应该解决的。
    政协自治区委员会副主任买合买提江·买合苏木说：我现在比过去消极多了，胆子也小了，不敢提意见。原因是我过去曾因政协方面的工作给党委统战部和有关领导同志提出不少意见，但长期得不到答复，因此，也就不敢再提意见了。他说，我认为政协的任务应当是帮助人民委员会进行工作，经常反映人民群众的意见和要求，但自治区政协没有能很好的完成这一任务，没有深入群众、联系群众，但这个责任不能完全怪我们，主要的要由党委统战部负责。因为我们工作中有了困难，找统战部有关负责同志解决，有时找一个月也找不到，这样工作当然作不好。1956年人民代表大会有六十多件提案还未处理，这些提案都是人民群众的合理要求，人民代表也经常催问，但一直无法作答。当然我们也有官僚主义。因此群众认为政协不能为他解决问题，这样群众和政协就发生了矛盾，政协委员因看到问题解决不了，也就不再提意见了。
  切实克服大汉族主义发挥少数民族干部作用
    水利厅副厅长马吉提·阿克毛拉也夫说：自治区成立后，提拔了许多本地民族干部，特别是提拔了一部分本地民族领导干部，这是很好的。但是在提拔中只注意了政治条件，没有注意工作能力等条件。同时派了民族领导干部以后由于下面没有民族干部，民族领导干部实际上是“空头司令”，只好向汉族干部布置工作。可是工作中却遇到了汉族干部光接受任务而不执行任务的现象。这样就影响了民族领导干部的工作情绪。这当然不是说下面的汉族干部都有大汉族主义思想，但是有些汉族干部确实有大汉族主义思想。对这些问题，民族领导干部不好讲，怕讲了不听，我建议确实实现民族化，改变这个情况。
    另外，我感到自治区人事局没有担负起自己的任务，干部不强，他们不知那些机关缺什么干部，当然也不知道派什么样的干部，派的干部也不大受人欢迎。我希望加强人事局的工作，使其能担负自己的任务。
    米吉提说：关于水利厅民族干部很少的问题，我曾提过多少次意见也不顶事。去年自治区成立了好多水文站，适合民族干部工作，可是配备的干部中多是汉族干部，我提意见希望增加民族干部，因厅长不同意，我的意见没有起到作用。我认为水利厅对培养民族干部是不重视的。比如，原来水利厅计划办四个学校，培养本地民族水利技术干部，以后决定办一个，只招收两千人，我觉得这个数目太少了，因为汉族干部在工作中是有很多困难的。比如我们派下去的有些干部，由于语言不通，作不了工作，只好帮助农民拔拔草。
    在这次座谈会上发言的还有新疆学院副教务长文斐然、新疆医学院副教务主任徐天一、水利厅副厅长王寿亭等人。座谈会将继续举行。
