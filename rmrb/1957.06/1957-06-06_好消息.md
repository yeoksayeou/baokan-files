	"Good News"
	Every so often, a notice with the large characters "Good News" can be seen at the entrance of the county department store. Although the timing is different, the content is basically the same: "Biscuits and sweets on sale at ×% discount..." "×× brand wool on sale at ×% discount..."
	However, when customers pick up these cheap goods and take a closer look, they are somewhat stunned. It turns out that the biscuits have gone bad, the sweets have melted, and the wool has begun to mildew...
	Such "good news" should be less frequent. (Tian He, Jiangshan, Zhejiang)

### “好消息”

    “好消息”
    每隔一段时间，在县百货公司门口就可以看见一张写着“好消息”几个大字的布告，时间虽然不同，但内容基本上是差不多的：“饼干、糖果打×折出售……”“××牌毛线打×折出售……”。
    但是，当顾客们拿起这些便宜货仔细一看时，都有些发呆了，原来饼干已经变质了，糖果融化了，毛线开始霉烂了……。
    这样的“好消息”，还是少点吧。　　（浙江江山田禾）
