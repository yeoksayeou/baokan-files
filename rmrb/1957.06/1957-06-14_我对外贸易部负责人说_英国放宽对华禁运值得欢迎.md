Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: A responsible person from the Ministry of Foreign Trade today made a statement to a Xinhua News Agency reporter regarding the British decision on May 30th to relax the embargo on China.

He said: China's attitude towards the so-called "embargo" is very clear, which is to completely oppose the "embargo," but we welcome any measures taken by countries implementing the "embargo" that are conducive to improving international trade relations. Therefore, China welcomes the steps taken by Britain, as it is beneficial to easing international tensions and developing Sino-British trade.

The responsible person said: "After Britain takes this step, trade relations between China and Britain will be more active than before." He also said: "We are studying the commodities that Britain has decided to export to China and those that Britain can truly and reliably supply, to determine which ones we need and are suitable." The responsible person continued: "Regrettably, the so-called 'embargo' measures have not been completely abolished, which will undoubtedly still hinder the comprehensive development of normal international trade."

　　我对外贸易部负责人说
　　英国放宽对华禁运值得欢迎
    据新华社12日讯　对外贸易部一位负责人今天对新华社记者发表了关于英国在5月30日作出放宽对华禁运决定的谈话。
    他说：中国对于所谓“禁运”的态度是很清楚的，就是完全反对“禁运”，但是我们对于执行“禁运”的国家的任何有利于改进国际贸易关系的措施是欢迎的。因此中国欢迎英国所采取的步骤，它对于缓和国际紧张局势和发展中英贸易是有益的。
    这位负责人说：“英国采取这一步骤以后，中英两国间的贸易关系将会较前活跃”。他又说：“我们正在研究英国决定输往中国的商品和英国真正能够而且可靠供应的商品中，那些是我们需要的、合用的。”这位负责人接着说：“遗憾的是，所谓‘禁运’措施还没有完全取消，这无疑地仍会阻挠国际间正常贸易的全面发展。”
