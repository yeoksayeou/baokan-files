　　Sharing a Kettle of Water with Workers
　　Gu Ye
　　The leading cadres of the General Affairs Section of the Baijiazhuang Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau in Taiyuan City participated in physical labor in Group 44 of Xiaonan Pit in May. They saw that in this coal mining face, there were forty workers, with only one large iron kettle without a lid. Because of the heavy coal dust underground, the water was covered with dust and difficult to drink. They thought, "In the past, when workers complained about not having enough water to drink, we thought they were just making a fuss. Now we see that drinking water is really a big problem." They saw that the workers' dry rations were not good, their shoes had holes, and their work clothes were also somewhat torn. They thought, "It seems that the food needs to be improved urgently, and the 'individual protective equipment' is distributed too slowly." After coming out of the mine, they immediately bought four tea stoves and installed them at the mine entrance, so that the workers could drink good boiled water. They organized several people to concentrate their efforts on distributing work clothes and other individual protective equipment, and mobilized the cooks to make fragrant sweet cakes for the workers going down the mine as dry rations. In the past, the workers criticized the cadres: "The Party, government, and union stand idly by; they don't care about our difficulties." Now, they see that the cadres who come to participate in physical labor can really solve problems in a timely manner, and they have changed their tune to praise them: "The Party, government, and union work hard down the mine, they see problems clearly, and everyone likes their promptness."

　　Other leading cadres who participated in physical labor, such as Bureau Chief Jia of the Taiyuan Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry, had a different approach. They diligently moved bricks and transported earth on the construction site, and they bent over to shovel coal in the mine, working hard and conscientiously. There is no denying their attitude towards labor. However, the workers' comments on them were: "They worked hard, but unfortunately they didn't ask the workers what difficulties they had in their work. Instead, they made everyone worry about their safety. If it's always like this, it would be better to save the gasoline money for taking the car to participate in physical labor!"

　　Of these two approaches to participating in physical labor, the latter is more common at present. Some comrades believe that participating in physical labor will weaken leadership work, or that it is only to change society's view of manual labor, so they force themselves to work, forgetting to make friends with the workers, listen to their voices, and thereby improve leadership work. The gains of the leading cadres of the General Affairs Section of the Baijiazhuang Mine after working down the mine, and the workers' requirements and comments on the participation of leading cadres in physical labor, are all worth considering carefully by some leading cadres: What is the purpose of participating in physical labor?

　　同工人共饮一壶水
　　顾页
    太原市西山矿务局白家庄矿总务科的领导干部，5月里去小南坑四十四组参加体力劳动。他们看到在这个采煤工作面有四十名工人，只放着一个没有盖的大铁壶，因为井下煤尘大，水里浮着尘土，难以入口。他们想：“过去工人们提出喝不上水，还以为是乱嚷嚷，原来喝水真是个大问题。”看到工人们吃的干粮不好，穿的鞋有了窟窿，工作服也有些破。他们想：“这样看来，伙食急需改善，‘个体防护用品’发得太迟缓。”上井以后，他们立即买了四个茶炉，安到井口，让工人们喝到好开水；组织了几个人集中力量分发工作服等个体防护用品，发动炊事员们做香喷喷的甜饼，给下井工人当干粮。工人们从前批评干部：“党政工团，袖手旁观；我们有困难，你们不管。”现在，他们见到来参加体力劳动的干部真能及时解决问题，都改口称赞道：“党政工团，下井苦干，有问题看的不浅，办事不拖拉人人喜欢。”
    另外一些参加体力劳动的领导干部，如煤炭工业部太原管理局贾局长等，又是一种做法。他们在工地上勤快地搬砖运土，在矿井里弯腰曲背地攉煤，埋头苦干，劳动态度是无可非议的。不过，工人们对他们的评语却是：“他们干活是卖了劲了，可惜他们不问问工人们在劳动中有什么困难，反倒叫大家替他们担惊受怕，生怕他们不安全。如果老是这样，还不如省了那一笔坐车来参加体力劳动的汽油费！”
    这两种参加体力劳动的做法，后一种在目前是比较普遍的。有些同志以为参加体力劳动会减弱领导工作，或者以为只是为了改变社会上轻视体力劳动的观念，因此，硬着头皮去干活，忘了同工人交朋友，倾听工人的呼声，从而改进领导工作。白家庄矿总务科的领导干部下井劳动以后的收获，和工人们对领导干部参加体力劳动的要求和评语，都值得某些领导干部认真思索一下：参加体力劳动是为了什么？
