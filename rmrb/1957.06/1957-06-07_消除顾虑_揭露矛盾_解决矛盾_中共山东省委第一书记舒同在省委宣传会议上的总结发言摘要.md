    I. How to Further Implement the Policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy for developing literature and art, and science, and also a policy for correctly handling contradictions among the people. The issue of handling contradictions among the people can only be resolved through democratic methods and reasoning. The so-called "blooming" and "contending" means free discussion on a broad democratic basis. Only through democratic and free discussion can right and wrong be distinguished, and a true consensus be reached. Only by fully promoting the spirit of democracy can we fully mobilize all positive forces in the country, transform the negative into the positive, improve ideological standards, promote literature and art, revitalize science, so as to concentrate the wisdom and strength of the people of the whole country and ensure the victory of socialist construction. Therefore, earnestly implementing this policy is a major issue related to national construction, and is indispensable in the current and future entire national political life and ideological sphere. The Party's policy of "blooming" and "contending" is a fundamental and long-term policy. However, there are still obstacles to implementing this policy, especially ideological obstacles. These are mainly manifested in the following ideological concerns:
    1. Some people think that we are "first loosening, then tightening, then rectifying," and are afraid of being labeled with the big hat of reactionary remarks.
    "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is the Party's long-term and fundamental policy, and there will be no tightening. We are loosening today, loosening tomorrow, and loosening forever. There will be no rectification, only competition, debate about different opinions or counter-criticism from those who are criticized, which cannot be regarded as tightening or rectification. While you are letting go, you must allow others to let go, while you are contending, you must allow others to contend. Those who intentionally rectify others, retaliate against critics, or frame them will not only be disallowed by Party discipline, but the eyes of the masses are sharp and will be exposed and condemned by the masses. Contending must be based on reasoning, and no big labels are allowed. Contenders must have the spirit of upholding the truth and correcting mistakes. Mistakes are inevitable, and recognizing mistakes will improve oneself.
    2. Some people worry about what to do if "the higher-ups loosen, but the lower-downs don't loosen"?
    Letting go and contending is the Party's policy, and there should be a process of gradually clearing up thinking from top to bottom and implementing it step by step. As long as the lower-level organs and cadres resolve the problem in their understanding of the Party's policy, they will resolutely implement it.
    3. Can scientific and technological issues be let go, can they be contended? Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in science and technology is also an indispensable condition for revitalizing science and improving technology. However, different opinions on academic matters should not be confused with everyone doing their duty at work. Consultations in hospitals should still be decided by the attending doctor. Technical problems in factories should still be directed by engineers. Of course, it is also necessary for doctors and engineers to listen to others' opinions with an open mind before making decisions.
    4. Will letting go affect the prestige of leaders?
    Whether a leader has prestige, and the level of prestige, mainly depends on whether their leadership work is done well. Bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism will not lead to high prestige. Even if there is, it is false. Only through "blooming" and "contending" can we overcome the bad ideological style of leadership, improve leadership and work, establish true prestige, and enhance our own prestige.
    5. If opinions are not changed after they are raised, should we stop raising them?
    Although some leaders in the past had the phenomenon of "sincerely" accepting but resolutely not changing, it should be affirmed that knowing mistakes and correcting them is a virtue of the Chinese people, the Communist Party, and the vast majority of leading cadres. Sometimes, some comrades cannot change because the problem has not been thoroughly resolved in their understanding, or their determination is not strong enough. As long as we who raise opinions are tireless, again and again, with the spirit of making stubborn stones nod, not only raising opinions, but also helping them to correct them (of course, the main thing is to be conscious), they will always be able to correct them.
    Finally, will such letting go and contending lead to chaos?
    The purpose of letting go and contending is to achieve a consensus in thinking from inconsistent ideological understanding. If it is said that chaos may arise as a result, it is only a change from the original hidden state to an open state. After contending, chaos can be transformed into order (true consensus).
    II. Correctly Understand and Handle the Relationship between Leaders and the Masses
    1. Accurately assess the current tense situation in rural and urban areas. If we do not see the problems existing in the current rural areas, cities, and schools, and are negligent and careless, we cannot actively understand the situation and solve the problems that can be solved. Of course, we should not panic. These are contradictions among the people. As long as we do our work conscientiously, the situation can be eased.
    2. It should be seen that the current tense situation has its objective reasons, which are difficult to completely avoid in a major social change. However, the existence of bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist work styles in leadership, and the shortcomings and errors in work, are the main reasons. Therefore, it is necessary to go deep into places and units with problems, listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, and conscientiously analyze and study the situation and problems. It is absolutely necessary to solve the problems that can be solved in a timely and proactive manner.
    3. No matter whether there are deviations and errors in rural and urban work or in the implementation of policies, do not blame the grassroots cadres. The provincial party committee and leaders at all levels should take their own responsibilities. This is because the vast majority of grassroots cadres are working hard and diligently, and have done a lot for the country and the people. Their work is heavy and their level is not high, especially when the leadership has bureaucratism and subjectivism, and the policies are not clearly explained, and the tasks are required too high, too rigidly, and too urgently, it is easy for the executors to deviate. Some cadres commit coercion, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, which is often the result of the leadership relaxing ideological leadership and education, and failing to control them strictly. Therefore, it is inappropriate to blame grassroots cadres. However, it should also be seen that there are a small number or individual grassroots cadres who have degenerated ideologically, or even bad elements who have sneaked in, and who have seriously violated laws and discipline and have repeatedly refused to be reformed. Their bad behavior should not be the responsibility of the leadership, and should not be tolerated or condoned, but should be treated seriously and handled correctly.
    4. The fundamental way to solve the relationship between leaders and the led, and between cadres and the masses, lies in constantly promoting democracy. Only by establishing regular democratic life and systems can we avoid the occurrence of great democracy.
    III. Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Relations Inside and Outside the Party
    The deep trenches and high walls that exist in relations inside and outside the Party are mainly due to the fact that some leading cadres and Party members in our organs have sectarian emotions that do not proceed from the interests of the 600 million people, lack a comprehensive understanding of non-Party experts and professors, underestimate the progress made by non-Party intellectuals in recent years and their role in national construction, and at the same time are complacent and self-righteous, pretending to understand what they do not understand, not learning modestly, not respecting the opinions of non-Party people, and not supporting the work of non-Party people; in the use, training, promotion, and treatment of cadres inside and outside the Party, they cannot be treated equally. As a result, some non-Party people cannot have the power that comes with their positions, and cannot fully play their role in national construction, and even make some non-Party people feel distressed and uneasy, and become passive, accumulating many opinions in their hearts for a long time, deepening the estrangement between each other, and affecting unity. If this situation is not thoroughly changed, it will be detrimental to the cause of national construction.
    The main link in changing this situation is that Party member cadres must first recognize the changes in the current situation, eliminate sectarian emotions, take the initiative to improve relations with non-Party people, and earnestly implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals. They must respect and trust non-Party people, support them, be selfless in cadre policy, use people according to their talents, have more contact with non-Party people and talk to them, and humbly learn from them in their work, so that they can quickly change from being laymen to being experts.
    The cadres we send to schools and health departments are generally working hard, but individual Party member leading cadres do have serious mistakes, which have aroused public outrage inside and outside the Party. The provincial party committee will immediately deal with it seriously after the meeting. There is no special treatment for Party members who make mistakes, which is clearly stipulated by our Party long ago.
    Regarding the issue of self-transformation of non-Party intellectuals, we believe that the vast majority of intellectuals will consciously carry out self-transformation, go to factories and rural areas in a planned way to deeply connect with the masses and connect with reality, gradually replace the old world outlook with a new world outlook (the world outlook of the working class), and will actively improve relations inside and outside the Party, and will better serve the cause of socialist construction and serve the people.
    IV. Adhere to the Policy of "Counter-revolutionaries Must Be Eliminated, Mistakes Must Be Corrected"
    The achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement should be affirmed. We should see the overall aspect and the mainstream aspect (the things that determine the essence) of the movement. We should not negate the entire achievements because of the large deviations in individual units, nor should we ignore certain deviations that occurred in the movement, especially the more serious deviations in individual units, because we affirm the achievements of the entire movement. In order to better clarify right and wrong and implement the central government's policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be eliminated, mistakes must be corrected," the central government has decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection this year, and we are also making preparations in this regard. For those who have been wrongly struggled against and whose cases have been clarified, there is no need to wait for the inspection, and the mistakes should be resolutely and quickly corrected. The reputation of those who have been wrongly struggled against should be restored, and it should be announced publicly in their units. The scope in which they were struggled against should be the scope in which their reputation is restored. Units that have not done so should earnestly correct themselves and should not perfunctorily delay. Comrades who have been wrongly struggled against should also put down their burdens ideologically and eliminate estrangement. It is not good to be wrongly struggled against, but clarifying the problem can enable the organization and the masses to have a better understanding and trust in themselves.
    V. Truly Achieve Both Rectification and Work Without Neglecting Either
    To achieve both rectification and work without neglecting either, first of all, it is necessary to clarify ideologically that the purpose of rectification is to overcome bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, improve thinking, change work style, improve work, and correctly handle contradictions among the people. Rectification and work are not opposed to each other and cannot be separated. Rectification requires learning and changing at the same time. Through rectification and learning, we should timely analyze the current work situation and problems, discover contradictions, and solve contradictions. We cannot close the door to rectify and ignore work, or even increase bureaucratism. Secondly, the first secretaries and main responsible persons of departments should grasp rectification, and should comprehensively grasp rectification and work. Furthermore, after the meeting, provincial-level organs should, in accordance with the spirit of great loosening and great contending, expose contradictions, first present problems, and then further study documents and carefully check work and ideological style. In the process of exposing contradictions, problems that are urgently related to current work should be grasped and resolved immediately.
    VI. How to Do a Good Job in Ideological and Political Work
    How should the first secretary of the Party committee grasp ideological and political work? 1. Do not separate from the current work and grasp ideological and political work alone, but guarantee the current work by doing a good job in ideological and political work. The purpose of political and ideological work is to guarantee the realization of the Party's tasks, to guarantee the implementation of the Party's policies, and also to explain the truth, so that Party members, cadres and the masses can understand what to do, why to do it, and how to do it, and achieve completely conscious action, turning the Party's tasks and policies into the conscious actions of the masses. 2. In the current work of production, distribution, and purchase, we should pay attention to explaining the policies and practices, and should not simply explain the tasks and figures, so that cadres and the masses can consciously complete the tasks. We should timely analyze and study the ideological situation and trends of cadres and the masses, and propose the content and requirements of education. Pay special attention to grasping the ideological and political work of grassroots organizations and teach grassroots cadres the ability to reason. 3. Promote all departments and all professional cadres to do ideological and political work.

    消除顾虑　揭露矛盾　解决矛盾
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同在省委宣传会议上的总结发言摘要
    一、如何进一步贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”是发展文艺、科学的方针，也是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针。处理人民内部矛盾问题只能用民主的方法，说理的方法。所谓“齐放”“争鸣”也就是在广泛民主基础之上自由讨论。也只有经过民主自由的讨论才能辨明是非，达到认识上的真正一致。只有充分发扬民主精神，才能充分调动全国一切积极力量，化消极为积极，提高思想水平，繁荣文艺，振兴科学，以便集中全国人民的智慧与力量，保证社会主义建设事业的胜利。因此，认真贯彻执行这一方针是关系到国家建设的大问题，是当前与今后整个国家政治生活、思想领域中所不可缺少的。党的“齐放”“争鸣”的方针是根本的长远的方针。但是贯彻执行这一方针还是有障碍的，特别是思想上的障碍。这主要表现在下述各种思想顾虑：
    1、有人认为我们是“先放后收再整”，怕扣反动言论的大帽子。
    “齐放”“争鸣”是党的长远的根本的方针，不会有收。今天放，明天放，后天还是放，永远是放。更不会被整，有的只是竞争，对不同的意见的争论或被批评者的反批评，这不能看成是收或整。自己放也要允许别人放，自己鸣也要允许别人鸣。有意整人的人，对批评者打击报复陷害的人，不仅党纪不允许，群众的眼睛是亮的，会被揭穿，会受到群众的指责的。争鸣要以理服人，绝不允许任何扣大帽子。争鸣者要有坚持真理修正错误的精神，错误是难免的，认识到错误就提高了自己。
    2、有人顾虑“上面放、下面不放”怎么办呢？
    放鸣是党的方针，是要有个从上而下逐级打通思想、逐步贯彻执行的过程。下级机关与干部对党的方针只要认识上解决了问题，也会是坚决贯彻执行的。
    3、科学技术问题能不能放，能不能争鸣呢？在科学技术上的齐放争鸣，也是振兴科学提高技术所不可缺少的条件。但是在学术上的各持己见，不能与工作上的各尽职守混同起来。医院中的会诊，仍要由主治医生下决心。工厂中的技术问题，仍要由工程师指挥。当然医生、工程师下决心、虚心听取别人意见也是必要的。
      4、放起来会不会影响领导威信呢？
    领导的有没有威信，威信高低，主要在于自己的领导工作做得好不好。有官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，就不会有很高的威信。即使有也是虚假的。通过“齐放”“争鸣”，才能克服领导的不良思想作风，改进领导与工作，才能树立真正的威信，提高自己的威信。
      5、提了意见不能改，是不是就不提了呢？
    固然有个别领导在过去有“诚恳”接受坚决不改的现象，但是，应该肯定知过必改，是中国人民的、也是共产党与绝大部分领导干部的美德。有时有的同志不能改，还是认识上没有彻底解决问题，或者决心还不够，只要我们提意见者不厌其烦，一而再再而三，有叫顽石点头的精神。不光提意见，而且帮助他改正（当然主要还是要自觉）总会能改正的。
    最后，这样放鸣会不会乱？
    放鸣的目的是由思想认识的不一致，达到思想认识上的一致，如果说可能因此而产生混乱，那也不过是由原来的隐蔽状态而变为公开的状态而已，经过争鸣就可由混乱而达到不乱（真正的一致）。
    二、正确认识和处理领导同群众的关系
    1、准确估计当前农村与城市的某些紧张情况。如果看不到当前农村、城市、学校各方面存在的问题，麻痹大意，就不能主动地摸清情况解决可以解决的问题。当然也不应惊惶失措。这是人民内部的矛盾，只要认真做好工作，是可以使情况缓和下来的。
    2、应该看到当前的紧张情况，固然有其客观的原因，是社会大变动中所难以完全避免的。但是，领导上的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义作风的存在，工作上有缺点错误则是很主要的原因。因此，必须深入有问题的地方与单位，好好听听群众的意见，切实地分析研究情况与问题，应该解决可以解决的问题，及时主动地解决是十分必要的。
    3、不论农村与城市工作上与政策的贯彻执行上，发生偏差与错误，不要指责基层干部，应该由省委与各级领导担起自己的责任。这是因为基层干部绝大部分是辛辛苦苦、勤勤恳恳的，为国家为人民做了不少事，工作繁重，水平不高，特别是领导有官僚主义、主观主义，对于有些政策交代不清，任务要求过高，过死过急，容易使执行者发生偏差。有些干部发生强迫命令、违法乱纪，也往往是由于领导放松思想领导与教育，控制不严的结果。因此，指责基层干部是不应该的。但是，也应该看到有少数或个别的基层干部思想上蜕化变质，乃至是混入的坏分子，严重的违法乱纪而又屡教不改的分子，他们的恶劣行为，就不能要由领导上负责，就不能纵容、姑息，而应严肃对待，正确处理。
    4、解决领导与被领导、干部与群众的关系问题的根本办法，在于经常发扬民主，只有建立经常的民主生活与制度，才能避免发生大民主。
      三、认真搞好党内外关系
    党内外关系上存在的深沟高墙，主要是由于我们有些机关的党的领导干部与党员，存在着不从六亿人民利益出发的宗派主义情绪，对党外专家、教授缺乏全面的认识，对党外知识分子几年来的进步及其在国家建设事业中的作用估计不足，同时自己又居功自傲，自以为是，不懂装懂，不虚心学习，不尊重党外人士的意见，不支持党外人士的工作；对党内外干部的使用培养提拔待遇等问题上，不能一视同仁。以致使有些党外人士不能做到有职有权，充分发挥其在国家建设中的作用，甚至使有些党外人士苦闷不安，消极起来，将不少意见长期积压在心里，加深了互相之间的隔阂，影响到团结。这一情况不彻底改变过来，是不利于国家建设事业的。
    改变这一状况的主要环节，首先在于党员干部认清当前形势的变化，消除宗派主义情绪，主动搞好与党外人士的关系，切实贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，要尊重信任党外人士，要支持他们，在干部政策上应大公无私，量才使用，要多和党外人士接触谈心，要虚心向他们学习业务，要使自己尽快由外行变为内行。
    我们派在学校卫生部门的干部，一般都是努力工作的，但个别党员领导干部，确实有严重的错误，因而引起党内外的公愤。省委要在会后立即做严肃的处理。党员犯了错误，没有特殊的照顾，这是我们党早有明确规定的。
    关于党外知识分子的自我改造问题，我们相信绝大部分知识分子是会自觉地进行自我改造的，有计划地下厂下乡深入地联系群众联系实际，逐渐以新的世界观（工人阶级的世界观）代替旧的世界观，是会积极地来搞好党内外关系的，是会更好地为社会主义建设事业服务，为人民服务的。
    四、坚持贯彻执行“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针
    对肃反运动的成绩要肯定，要看到运动的总体方面，主流方面（决定本质的东西），不要因个别单位偏差较大而否定整个成绩，也不要因肯定整个运动的成绩而忽视运动中所发生的某些偏差，特别个别单位比较严重的偏差。为了更好地弄清是非，贯彻中央的“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，中央已决定今年要进行全面的检查，我们也已在进行这方面的准备工作。对于目前已经弄清案情确属错斗者，不必等待检查，应该坚决迅速纠正错误。对被错斗者要恢复名誉，而且要在所在单位公开宣布。在什么范围斗争的，就在什么范围恢复名誉。尚未这样做的单位要切实改正过来，不要敷衍拖延。被错斗了的同志，也要在思想上放下包袱，消除隔阂。被错斗是不好的，但弄清了问题，就可以使组织与群众对自己有更好的了解，更加信任。
      五、切实做到整风、工作两不误
    要做到整风与工作两不误，首先在思想上要明确整风的目的是为了克服官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，提高思想，转变作风，改进工作，正确处理人民内部的矛盾。整风与工作不是对立的，不能分割起来。整风要求边学边改，要通过整风学习及时分析当前工作情况与问题，发现矛盾，解决矛盾，不能关门整风，不管工作，乃至增加官僚主义。其次第一书记与部门主要负责人要抓整风，应该将整风与工作全面抓起来。再是，省级机关，会后要按照大放大鸣的精神，揭露矛盾，先摆问题，再进一步学习文件，细致地检查工作，检查思想作风。在揭露矛盾中，凡对当前工作迫切有关的问题，即应抓紧解决。
    六、如何做好思想政治工作
    党委第一书记如何抓思想政治工作呢？1、不要脱离当前工作，单独抓思想政治工作，而是以做好思想政治工作来保证做好当前工作。政治思想工作的目的，就在于保证党的任务的实现，保证党的方针的贯彻执行，也就在于讲通道理，使党员干部群众都懂得做什么，为什么和怎样办，达到完全自觉的行动，把党的任务方针变为群众的自觉行动。2、在当前生产、分配、征购工作中，要注意讲清政策与做法，不要简单地交代任务与数字，使干部与群众自觉地完成任务。对干部与群众的思想情况与动向要及时分析研究，提出教育的内容与要求。特别注意抓基层组织的思想政治工作，教会基层干部讲道理的本领。3、推动各个部门与所有专业干部都做思想政治工作。
