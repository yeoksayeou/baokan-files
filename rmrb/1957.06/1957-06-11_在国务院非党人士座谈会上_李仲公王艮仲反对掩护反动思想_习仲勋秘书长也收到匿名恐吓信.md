Xinhua News Agency, 10th. How should one view some of the remarks that harm socialism which have emerged in the current rectification movement? At a symposium of non-Party figures convened today by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, several non-Party figures expressed different opinions on this issue.

	Wan Maizi believes that Chu Anping and Yang Yuqing's opinions are only serious ideological problems.

	Wan Maizi, a Counselor of the State Council, believes that Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou's speeches have serious anti-socialist sentiments and are extremely reactionary. However, Chu Anping's proposal of "the Party's world" and Yang Yuqing's proposal of "getting off the sedan chair" and "stepping down" are only serious ideological problems. He said that they are just "seeking novelty to be superior," and will not rest until their words are shocking. Subjectively, they do not necessarily want to oppose the Party's leadership, but objectively they have had a very bad influence. He said that intellectuals are easily accepted in theory, but unconsciously they will reveal petty-bourgeois ideological sentiments.

	When talking about Tan Tiwu and Chen Mingshu's speeches, Wan Maizi said that they are "absolutely loyal" to the Party and "support the Party," but some of the opinions they raised to the Party are incorrect. This should be separated from deviating from the Party's leadership.

	Wan Maizi said that the people who raised the opinions have errors in their ideological understanding, and some of their opinions can still be considered.

	Li Zhonggong said: The great blooming and contending must never allow reactionary remarks to run rampant.

	Li Zhonggong, a Counselor of the State Council, disagreed with Wan Maizi's opinion. He said: "Wan Maizi's analysis of the remarks of Chu Anping and others dilutes the seriousness of these reactionary remarks and reduces the responsibility they should bear to the Party, the country, and the people." Chu Anping said that a Party member should be arranged as the head of every unit, large or small, across the country, but the actual situation is not like that. Since the reality is not like this, but it is said to be "the Party's world," this is a remark that endangers socialism. Yang Yuqing said that intellectuals are all against the status quo. Of course, a bad status quo must be opposed, but it does not mean that even a good status quo must be opposed. Wan Maizi regards these opinions as merely unconscious and accidental reflections of old and residual thoughts, which will further encourage some people with ulterior motives.

	Li Zhonggong believes that criticizing wrong opinions does not mean "taking back." He advocates great blooming and contending, but must never allow these reactionary remarks to run rampant. He said that as senior non-Party intellectuals, even if they do not stand on the position of the working class, but stand on the position of the people, they must resolutely wage a sharp and uncompromising struggle against reactionary remarks.

	In his speech, Li Zhonggong also mentioned that because he criticized these wrong remarks, someone wrote him an anonymous letter some time ago scolding him for "catering to the Party's evils." Xi Zhongxun, who was presiding over the meeting, interjected at this time and said that he had also received an anonymous letter threatening him to "pay attention anytime, anywhere, and the whole family should pay attention."

	Lu Yuwen then said that after receiving the anonymous letter last time, he had received four more anonymous letters.

	Wang Genzhong, a Counselor of the State Council, expressed disagreement with Wan Maizi's views. He believes that remarks that endanger socialism should be criticized, and only through criticism can new unity be achieved. He said that we should carry out the rectification movement according to the criteria of socialism. However, the rectification movement reflects that after several years of ideological transformation, some people have not firmly established this basic position. Some people are intimately concerned about the pain of those who were struggled against in the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, but they are willing to forgive remarks that endanger the Party, the people, and socialism.

	Wang Genzhong believes that Wan Maizi's statement that Chu Anping and others have serious ideological errors, but are subjectively loyal is incorrect. He said that they may be loyal in some respects, but statements such as "the Party's world" cannot be said to be loyal. Using Wan Maizi's statement only covers up the errors, and in this way, unity cannot be achieved on a new basis—the socialist basis.

	Wang Genzhong said that Chu Anping, Yang Yuqing, Zhang Naiqi, and Zhang Bojun's erroneous opinions are seriously harmful.

	Wang Genzhong said that before liberation, anti-Chiang was the basis of our unity. But when engaging in socialism, we must transform ourselves in order to achieve unity on the basis of socialism. Wang Genzhong went on to talk about demolishing walls, which must be done from two aspects. He said that we have capitalism and socialism in our minds, and people of bourgeois origin have bourgeois ideology as the dominant position. Therefore, for non-Party figures, demolishing walls means demolishing capitalist ideology. If we maintain capitalist ideology, the Communist Party cannot demolish the walls unilaterally. Therefore, we must break capitalism and establish socialism.

	Wang Genzhong believes that there are also walls between non-Party figures, and unity cannot be achieved on a new basis without criticism. He said that in ideological struggles, errors cannot be concealed. Criticizing wrong thoughts is conducive to great blooming and contending and helping the Party to carry out the rectification movement. Without a stand and without criticizing wrong thoughts, it will hinder great blooming and contending.

	Wang Genzhong believes that it is not surprising that Wu Jingshe, Tong Shaochen, Li Kangnian, and others put forward some wrong opinions in the midst of blooming and contending, because they are all capitalists, but the harm of the wrong opinions of Chu Anping, Yang Yuqing, Zhang Bojun, and Zhang Naiqi is even more serious. He said that Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou's anti-Communist remarks are obviously reactionary, but the harm of these seemingly correct opinions is even more serious. He also said that Chu Anping is the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, and he actually said things like "the Party's world." Why does Yang Yuqing want the editor-in-chief of the People's Daily to step down, but not the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily?

	Wan Maizi then expressed his agreement with Li Zhonggong's analysis and fully agreed with Wang Genzhong's speech in theory. He said that what he said that some people's opinions are not correct, but they are "absolutely loyal" to the Party only refers to Chen Mingshu and Tan Tiwu of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and he does not know about other people.

	Also speaking at today's symposium were Ma Keqiang, who works at the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, Zi Yaohua, who works at the People's Bank of China, and Lu Yu, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau.

　　在国务院非党人士座谈会上
　　李仲公王艮仲反对掩护反动思想
　　习仲勋秘书长也收到匿名恐吓信
    新华社10日讯  应该如何看待当前整风运动中出现的一些危害社会主义的言论？在国务院秘书长习仲勋今天召开的非党人士座谈会上，几位非党人士对这个问题表示了不同的意见。
    万枚子认为储安平、杨玉清的意见只是严重的思想问题
    国务院参事万枚子认为葛佩琦、王德周的发言有严重的反社会主义情绪，是极端反动的。但是储安平提出“党天下”、杨玉清提出“下轿”、“下台”只是严重的思想问题。他说，他们只是“立异为高”，语不惊人死不休，主观上不一定就是要反对党的领导，只是客观上起了很不好的影响。他说，知识分子在理论上是容易接受的，但在不知不觉中又会流露出小资产阶级思想情绪。
    在谈到谭惕吾、陈铭枢的发言时，万枚子说，他们对党“忠心耿耿，”是“拥护党”的，只是给党提的有些意见内容不对。这要与脱离党的领导分开来。
    万枚子说，提意见的人思想认识上有错误，他们的意见有一些还是可以考虑的。
    李仲公说：大鸣大放决不能让反动言论泛滥
    国务院参事李仲公不同意万枚子的意见。他说：“万枚子对储安平等人的言论所作的分析，冲淡了这些反动言论的严重性，减轻了对党、国家和人民应负的责任。”储安平说在全国范围内不论大小单位都要安排一个党员做头儿，可是实际情况并不是这样。既然现实不是这样，而要说是“党天下”，这就是危害社会主义的言论。杨玉清说文人都是反现状的。不好的现状当然要反，但并不是连好的现状也要反。万枚子把这些意见当作只是旧的残余思想无意识的偶然的反映，这样就会更加鼓励一些别有用心的人。
    李仲公认为对错误意见进行批评，并不就是“收”。他主张大鸣大放，但决不能让这些反动言论泛滥。他说，作为党外的高级知识分子，不说站在工人阶级立场，就是站在人民的立场，也要坚决和反动言论进行尖锐的不妥协的斗争。
    李仲公在发言中，还谈到他因为批评了这些错误言论，前些时就有人写匿名信骂他“逢党之恶”。主持会议的习仲勋在这时插话说，他也收到了匿名信，威吓他“随时随地留意，全家留意”。
    卢郁文接着也说，在上次收到匿名信之后，他又收到四封匿名信。
    国务院参事王艮仲表示不同意万枚子的看法。他认为应该对危害社会主义的言论进行批判，通过批评才能达到新的团结。他说，我们应该根据社会主义的准则来进行整风。但整风中反映出经过几年来的思想改造，有的人并没有站稳这个基本立场。有些人对土地改革、肃反等运动中被斗争的人的痛痒血肉相关，但对于危害党、危害人民和社会主义的言论却肯原谅。
    王艮仲认为万枚子说储安平等人的思想错误严重，但主观上是忠心耿耿的这种说法是不对的。他说，可能他们某些地方是忠心耿耿的，但“党天下”这类的说法不能说是忠心耿耿的。用万枚子的说法只是掩盖错误，这样，并不能达到在新的基础上——社会主义基础上的团结。
    王艮仲说储安平、杨玉清、章乃器和章伯钧的错误意见危害严重
    王艮仲说，解放以前，反蒋是我们团结的基础。但在搞社会主义的时候，我们必须改造自己才能在社会主义的基础上达到团结。王艮仲接着谈到拆墙必须从两方面来拆。他说，我们的思想上有资本主义，有社会主义，而资产阶级出身的人资产阶级思想是占主要地位的，所以，对于非党人士来说，拆墙就是拆资本主义的思想。如果我们保持着资本主义思想。共产党单方面拆墙是拆不掉的。因此就必须破资本主义，立社会主义。
    王艮仲认为在非党人士之间也有墙，不经过批评就不能在新的基础上达到团结。他说，在思想斗争中不能掩饰错误。批判了错误的思想才能有利于大放大鸣和帮助党进行整风，没有立场，不去批评错误的思想，就会妨碍大放大鸣。
    王艮仲认为在鸣放中间，吴经畬、童少臣、李康年等提出一些错误意见是不足为奇的，因为他们都是资本家，但是储安平、杨玉清、章伯钧和章乃器的错误意见的危害就更为严重。他说，葛佩琦、王德周的反共言论一望就知道是反动的，但是这些似是而非的意见的危害就更加严重了。他还说，储安平是光明日报的总编辑，竟说出“党天下”这样的话，而杨玉清为什么要人民日报总编辑下台，却不要光明日报的总编辑下台呢？
    万枚子接着表示同意李仲公的分析，对王艮仲的发言在理论上完全同意。他说他所说的有些人提的意见内容虽然不对，对党是“忠心耿耿”的，只是指民革的陈铭枢、谭惕吾，对于其他的人他并不了解。
    在今天的座谈会上发言的，还有在中央工商行政管理局工作的马克强，在中国人民银行工作的资耀华和中央气象局副局长卢鋈。
