    Oil Painting

    In order to improve the quality of oil painting teaching and cultivate teachers, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government organized an "Oil Painting Training Class" in 1955, located at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Most of the trainees were young oil painting teachers selected from art academies and colleges across the country. Over the past two years, under the guidance of Soviet oil painting expert Professor Konstantin M. Maksimov, a two-time Stalin Prize winner, the trainees' oil painting creation level has greatly improved. Last summer, they went to the Northeast, the Yangtze River Bridge, northern Shaanxi, Shandong and other places to experience life and collect materials, and completed their graduation creations in nearly a year. At the time of graduation, the Central Academy of Fine Arts specially organized the "Oil Painting Training Class Graduation Creation Exhibition," exhibiting more than 20 oil painting creations and more than 100 studies by the trainees. Since the opening of the exhibition on May 22, it has received attention and welcome from art circles and the general public in the capital. Published here are some of the works from the exhibition. Among them, "Liu Hulan's Sacrifice," "Home," "Heroic Sisters," "Transfer," and "Young Underground Worker" depict the deeds of fighting against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. Due to space limitations, we have also selected other works to be published in this newspaper in succession.

    中央文化部为了提高油画教学质量、培养师资，于1955年主办了“油画训练班”，设在中央美术学院。学员大部分是从全国各美术院校选拔出来的青年油画教师。两年来，学员们在苏联油画专家、斯大林奖金两次获得者康·麦·马克西莫夫教授的指导下，油画创作水平有了很大的提高。去年夏天，他们曾分别到东北、长江大桥、陕北、山东等地体验生活、搜集材料，在将近一年的时间里完成了毕业创作。结业的时候，中央美术学院特主办“油画训练班毕业创作展览会”，展出学员们的二十余件油画创作和百余件习作。展览会自5月22日开幕以来，得到了首都美术界和广大群众的重视和欢迎。这里刊出的是展览会的一部分作品。其中“刘胡兰就义”“家”、“英雄的姊妹们”、“转移”和“青年地下工作者”，描绘了抗日战争时期和解放战争时期对敌斗争的事迹。因为限于篇幅，我们还选出另外一些作品先后在本报刊出。转移　王流秋长江的黎明　袁浩歇晌　魏传义冼星海在陕北　于长拱晨　谌北新老科学家方石珊先生　俞云阶刘胡兰就义　冯法穓英雄的姊妹们　王德威家　秦征青年地下工作者　侯一民农村妇女肖像　陆国英
