(Reported by our newspaper) The news of Lu Yuwen receiving a threatening letter in the newspaper aroused the anger of the vast number of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. At 7:00 PM on the 7th, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's trade union held a symposium with seventeen people, including engineers, staff, and workers. At the meeting, they expressed strong protest against the despicable act of writing anonymous threatening letters. At the same time, they refuted the various erroneous arguments about abandoning socialism that had been published in the newspaper in recent days.

    Zhao Jingwen, a worker from the Coking Department, said that the news of Lu Yuwen receiving a threatening letter in the newspaper shows the necessity of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Lu Yuwen said he supported socialism, and someone wrote him a threatening letter. We have been suppressing counter-revolutionaries for so long, and someone still dares to do this. What would have happened if we hadn't suppressed them in the past? He then angrily refuted Ge Peiqi's erroneous opinions. He said that before liberation, he worked at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Back then, he lived here alone, and when he went to the market, he always saw pork hanging in the stores. Why? Because many workers, like me, couldn't afford it! Now, my family of four earns eighty or ninety yuan a month, and we can afford half a jin of pork every day. How can the pork in the market not seem scarce? Those who say that life is worse now should come to the factory and see for themselves. He said that he is a worker with a low level of education. After reading those erroneous opinions, he felt both hatred and anger, but he couldn't write an article to refute them. He advocated holding more such symposiums to say what we want to say.

    Gu Shicheng, a technician from the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, said that he agreed with helping the Communist Party rectify its work style and carry out criticism. However, he felt that some people's speeches were straying further and further from the topic. Chu Anping's "Party World" is a feudalistic term. Feudal society was a family world. Liu Bang conquered the world, and generation after generation, the emperors were always named Liu. During the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, there was also nepotism. Is this the case now? Of course not. Chairman Mao is now the leader of the country, but the leaders below are not his relatives, but "brothers from all over the world" who grew up in the struggle. He said that someone writing a threatening letter to Lu Yuwen is too despicable. This is the same method used by Kuomintang secret agents. However, now is the people's world, and this method will definitely not work. He also said that judging from some people's speeches, their distance from the people is still too great. We should send them an invitation to come down and take a stroll, sit down and talk with us, and debate ideas.

    Li Yiqian, a worker from the Chief Power Engineer's Office, said: I am an ordinary worker, and I want to publish my opinion in the People's Daily. Ge Peiqi said that people's lives have not improved. This is blatant nonsense. Now the production volume in our factory is several times higher than before liberation, and the lives of the workers have improved. Before liberation, Jin Ding Street had nothing. Now a large area of workers' dormitories has been built. Before liberation, I went to pick coal with everyone after work. Now everyone is rich in food and clothing. This is an obvious fact that no one can deny.

    Liu Zhengwu, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Department, said that he was shocked after reading Chu Anping's speech. He said, Chu Anping said that it is now the "Party World," but what exactly does "Party World" mean? Before liberation, I was worried about food and clothing all day long, and nobody wanted me anywhere. If you didn't have connections at that time, you couldn't find a job. That was the world of party thugs! Now, take myself as an example. My life has improved many times over, needless to say. In terms of work, I, a non-Party member and workshop director, have a position and power, and I can fully express my opinions. How can it be said that non-Party members have no say, how can it be said to be a "Party World"? He said that Chu Anping, as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, actually has such thoughts. How can he run a newspaper? I don't know if Chu Anping admits the leadership of the Communist Party and if he still has doubts about the socialist road. He said that the matter of writing a threatening letter to Lu Yuwen must be clarified. What kind of tactics are these? Are there counter-revolutionaries at work?

    Zhang Zhi, a worker from the Iron Smelting Department, said that Ge Peiqi said that "Party members play the role of plainclothes police monitoring the masses," which is an unfounded slander. I have personally seen many Party members who connect with the masses and help the masses. How can you say they are monitoring the masses? For example, once, the wife of worker Ren Zhenhai fell ill. The Party members were very concerned about her and reported the matter to the leaders. She immediately received help and was cured. He said that Ge Peiqi said that people's lives are worse now, but I don't think so. As for myself, I started picking ore in this factory at the age of eleven, earning only one jin and three liang of cornmeal a day. At that time, workers who contracted cholera were buried alive before they even died. Now, I am a fifth-grade worker with more than eighty yuan a month. My family of seven constantly eats rice and flour. How can that be compared to the past?

    Zhao Chenglin, a staff member from the Iron Smelting Department, said that after reading the speeches and opinions published in the newspaper, he believed that the vast majority of opinions were correct, some opinions were incorrect, and a very few opinions seemed to have ulterior motives. Taking Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping's opinions as examples, he said: What does Ge Peiqi mean by saying that in 1949 the people of Beijing welcomed the PLA into the city just like a change of dynasty in history? In the past, the change of dynasties always meant that a minority ruled the majority. Now it is the vast majority exercising dictatorship over the extremely small number of counter-revolutionaries. How can this be compared? He said that Chu Anping said that it is now the "Party World," but the power organ of our country is the National People's Congress. The National People's Congress has representatives from all aspects, including the bourgeoisie. Several vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress are democratic figures. How can this be said to be a "Party World"? He said: Now it's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." We, the working class, are a big family, and we must speak out. We want to hold symposiums, write articles, and participate in debates. We don't allow only a few people to speak out.

    Wang Weilu, a staff member from the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, said that the opinions of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others cannot withstand the refutation of facts. He said, I know that what we are idealizing is not what they are asking for. The Communist Party's rectification is to correct mistakes, improve work, strengthen unity, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. We should offer suggestions to the Party in this spirit. What about the opinions they raise? In a word, they fear that the world will not be in chaos. An honest person, an honest intellectual, should never distort the facts. What are the facts? It is best to invite them to come down and take a look. He said that we should not be silent at this time of widespread criticism, but we have been too silent in the past. We should actively respond and counter those erroneous opinions.

    Gao Runzhi, Deputy Chief Engineer, said: The purpose of this rectification is to rely on the help of people inside and outside the Party to overcome shortcomings, improve work, and enable the Party to better lead the people of the whole country in building socialism. This proves that the Communist Party is sincerely trying to do a good job. It is unprecedented in history for a political party to openly solicit opinions from the masses. As a non-Party intellectual, I support the Party in doing this. The Party has done a lot of work for the people in the past. It is undeniable that there have been mistakes and shortcomings in the work, and individual Party members have not done their work well. That is why the Party launched the rectification. We are offering suggestions to the Party out of love for the Party, and our criticisms must be based on facts and be kind to others. I think the opinion of Ge Peiqi, which was recently published in the newspaper, is incorrect. How can you say that the lives of the broad masses have not improved? Since liberation, the broad masses' lives have improved. Only those who have suffered in the past can feel it most clearly. Take the workers in this factory as an example. Everyone has talked about their painful lives in the past. Now everyone is dressed neatly and eats rice and flour. In the past, they didn't see movies for years, but now they can see them twice a week. In the past, children could not go to school and receive education, but now they all go to school. My own life is also like this. Before liberation, there was inflation, and I earned a lot of money, but I couldn't maintain my life. Often, I would get paid today and then see the value discounted tomorrow. Now, my salary is more than enough to support my family, so I can deposit money in the bank.

    Isn't this an improvement in life? Chu Anping's characterization of the Communist Party's leadership as a "Party World" is very wrong. We must see a major premise clearly: protecting the interests of the working class and the interests of socialism. We cannot say that the Party's leadership is the Party's monopoly. Moreover, non-Party members participate in the leadership of any unit. As long as your opinions are in line with the interests of the broad masses of people, the Party will adopt them. As long as you have the ability and are willing to work, the Party attaches great importance to and relies on you. I am an example of this in this factory: When I first got here, I was an engineer in the Iron Smelting Workshop. Later, I became the Chief of the Iron Smelting Section, a Blast Furnace Technician, the Deputy Director of the Workshop, and now I am the Deputy Chief Engineer of the factory. I don't understand what is wrong with Chu Anping's statement that a Party member is assigned to be in charge of a department. The Party member in charge and the non-Party member in charge in several departments of our factory can unite and cooperate. The purpose is to do a good job. Now, the proposal to exclude Party member cadres from being in charge, what is the intention behind this?

    Chen Dengtang, the Director of Medical Services, said: I think that since the newspaper allows Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others to speak out, it should also allow us to speak out and publish our opinions. Chu Anping sometimes acknowledges the Party's leadership and sometimes says not to let Party members lead. What are people supposed to do? This is self-contradictory and cannot be justified. Chu Anping also said: "Throughout the country, in units of all sizes, even in a section or a group, a Party member must be arranged to be the head... forming the current monolithic situation of one family dominating the world." His words completely distort the facts. We can calculate: In factories, agencies, and schools, are there more Party member leading cadres or more non-Party member leading cadres? I am a medical worker, so let's take the leadership of our health department as an example: the Minister of Health is not a Party member, and the Director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau is also not a Party member. How many leaders of municipal hospitals are Party members and how many are not Party members? You can also calculate that. This is very illustrative. Chu Anping said that the talents of Party member leading cadres are not commensurate with the positions they hold. This situation may exist. But we can also see if the talents of non-Party member leading cadres are not commensurate with their positions? Chu Anping said that it is now the "Party World." I don't think so. Which political party in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, can mobilize everyone to offer opinions like this? This alone can show that Chu Anping's view is wrong.

    Cao Xiuren, Deputy Chief of the Technical Supervision Section, said: This time, to help the Party rectify its work style, most people's opinions are well raised, but the opinions of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, Li Kangnian, and others deviate from the interests of socialism. We workers understand that the Communist Party led the people through all kinds of hardships to win this socialism. It was not easy. We support the Communist Party, and we adhere to socialism. Some people say that the bourgeoisie no longer has duality and does not need to be reformed anymore. However, Li Kangnian wants to take interest for twenty years and also wants to get rid of the bourgeois label. Zhang Naqi said that fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income. Based on these words, it proves that they still have to reform themselves well. Chu Anping outwardly acknowledges the Communist Party's leadership, but in reality, he wants to abolish the Communist Party's leadership. What did he do in the past? What contributions has he made to the socialist cause? I don't know. However, today he is attacking Communist Party members for being leading cadres. This is outrageous! Our working class is the leading class. The working class leads through its own political party, through the responsible cadres of the Party. If he doesn't allow the Communist Party to participate in the leadership work of various departments, then who will lead? I think most of the Party members' leadership is competent. Since liberation, there have been great achievements in industry, agriculture, culture, and education. The work done in a few years is something that the reactionary ruling period could not do in decades or hundreds of years. Anyone with a conscience cannot deny this fact. Why don't we support the Communist Party's leadership?

    It is very good to let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend. Our working class also wants to speak out. Today is a beginning. We will continue to speak out until we speak out the truth.

### 石景山钢铁厂职工  反对离开社会主义的谬论  痛斥匿名恐吓的卑鄙手段

    石景山钢铁厂职工
    反对离开社会主义的谬论  痛斥匿名恐吓的卑鄙手段
    本报讯　报纸上登载了卢郁文接到恐吓信的消息，激起了石景山钢铁厂广大职工的愤怒。7日下午七时，石景山钢铁厂工会召开包括工程师、职员、工人共十七人的座谈会，会上对这种写匿名恐吓信的卑鄙行径，表示强烈的抗议。同时，对于连日报上发表的种种离开社会主义的错误言论，进行了驳斥。
    炼焦部工人赵景文说，报上发表卢郁文接到恐吓信的消息，我认为这正是说明了有肃反的必要。卢郁文说了拥护社会主义的话，就有人给他写恐吓信；我们肃反肃了这么久，还有人胆敢这样作，要是过去不肃反，这还了得么？接着他气愤地驳斥了葛佩琦的错误意见。他说，解放以前，我就在石景山钢铁厂作工。那时候光杆一人住在这里，到市场上走走，总能看到店里挂着猪肉。为什么？许多工人和我一样，买不起嘛！现在，我一家四口，每月工资八、九十元，一天吃得起半斤猪肉，市上的猪肉怎么能不显得少了？那些说现在生活坏了的人，顶好到工厂里来看看。他说，我是一个工人，文化水平很低，看了那些错误意见，又恨又气，可是写不成篇文章反驳它。我主张多开这样的座谈会，说说我们心里想说的话。
    总机械师室技术员顾士澄说，我赞成帮助共产党整风，开展批评。可是，我感到有些人的发言离题越来越远。储安平提出的“党天下”，这是封建社会的说法。封建社会是家天下，刘邦打下天下，一代接一代，总是姓刘的当皇帝；国民党反动统治时候也是裙带风。现在的情况是不是这样呢？当然不是。毛主席现在是国家的领袖，可是，下面的领导人并不是他的亲戚，而是从战斗中生长起来的“四海之内皆兄弟”。他说，有人给卢郁文写恐吓信，这件事情太卑鄙了。这和国民党特务的手法一样。可是，现在是人民的天下，这样手法保险行不通了。他还说，从某些人的发言看来，他们和人民的距离还太远。我们应该下个请帖，请他们下来逛一逛，和我们坐下来谈一谈，思想对思想，争鸣一番。
    总动力师室工人李义乾说：我是个普通工人，我要把我的意见在人民日报上登一登。葛佩琦说人民的生活没提高，这是睁着眼说瞎话。现在我们厂里的生产量比解放前提高了几倍，工人生活都改善了。解放前金顶街什么都没有，现在盖了那么一大片工人宿舍。解放前我下了班就和大伙一块去拣煤核，现在大家吃的、穿的都很富裕，这是明摆着的事实，谁也不能不承认。
    炼铁部副主任刘正五说，我看了储安平的发言，大吃一惊。他说，储安平说现在是“党天下”，可是，究竟什么叫“党天下”？解放以前，我整天愁吃愁穿，到哪哪不要；那时候没有门路，你就别想找到工作。那才是党棍子的天下呢！现在，拿我自己来看，生活不知好了多少倍，这是不必说的了。就说工作，我这个非党员、车间主任，有职有权，有意见可以充分地提，怎么能说非党员没有发言权，怎么能说“党天下”呢？他说，储安平身为光明日报的总编辑，竟有这种思想，怎么能办报呢？我不晓得储安平承认不承认共产党的领导，对社会主义的道路是不是还有怀疑。他说，给卢郁文写恐吓信的事情，一定要弄清楚。这是甚么手段？是不是有反革命分子在作祟呢？
    炼铁部工人张志说，葛佩琦说“党员起了监视群众的便衣警察的作用”，这是没有根据的诬蔑。我亲眼看到许多党员是联系群众、帮助群众的，怎么能说监视群众呢？比如，有一次，工人任振海的媳妇生病了，党员非常关心她，向领导上汇报了这件事，她马上得到帮助，把病治好了。他说，葛佩琦说现在人们的生活坏了，我看就不是这样。以我自己来讲，我从十一岁起，就在这个厂里捡矿石，一天只挣一斤三两棒子面；那时候，工人得了虎烈拉，还没有咽气，就被活埋了。现在，我已经是个五级工，一个月有八十多元钱，全家七口，不断大米白面，和过去怎么能比？
    炼铁部职员赵成林说，他看了报上登载的发言和意见，认为绝大多数意见是正确的，一部分意见是不正确的，极少数意见看来是别有企图的。他以葛佩琦和储安平的意见为例，说：葛佩琦说1949年北京人民欢迎解放军进城，跟历史上的改朝换代一样，这是什么意思？过去的改朝换代，改来改去，总是少数人统治多数人，现在是绝大多数人对极少数反革命专政，这怎么能相比？他说，储安平说现在是“党天下”，可是，我们国家的权力机关是全国人民代表大会，全国人民代表大会里面有各个方面、包括资产阶级的代表；全国人民代表大会常委会几位副委员长是民主人士，这怎能说是“党天下”？他说：现在“百家争鸣”，我们工人阶级是一大家，要鸣起来。我们要开座谈会，要写文章，要参加辩论，我们不许只让少数人鸣。
    总机械室职员王魏辂说，葛佩琦、储安平这些人的意见，受不起事实的驳斥。他说，我知道，我们理想的东西并不是他们要求的东西。共产党整风，是为了纠正错误，改进工作，加强团结，巩固人民民主专政。我们应该本着这个精神给党提意见。他们提的那些意见呢？一句话，唯恐天下不乱。一个正直的人，一个正直的知识分子，绝不应该歪曲事实。事实怎么样，最好请他们下来看一看。他说，在这广泛开展批评的时候，我们不该沉默，可是过去太沉默了。我们应该积极起来，反击那些错误的意见。
    副总工程师高润芝说：这次整风的目的，是依靠党内党外人们的帮助，克服缺点，改进工作，使党更好地领导全国人民建设社会主义。这证明共产党是诚心诚意想把工作做好。一个政党公开征求群众对它的意见，这在历史上是没有过的。做为一个非党的知识分子，我是拥护党这样作的。党过去为人民做了很多工作，不可否认，在工作中也有错误和缺点；个别党员工作做得还很不好。正因为这样，党才发动整风。我们是为了爱护党才给党提意见，我们的批评必须实事求是，与人为善。我们完全能够判断正确的意见和不正确的意见、善意的批评和恶意的攻击。最近报纸上登载的葛佩琦的意见，我认为是不正确的。怎能说广大群众的生活没有改善呢？解放以来，广大群众的生活是不是改善了，只有过去受过痛苦的人感觉得才最清楚。拿本厂的工人来说，过去的痛苦生活大家都说过了，现在大家穿得干干净净，吃的大米白面；过去成年不看电影，现在一星期能看两次。过去子女不能上学受教育，现在都上了学。我自己的生活也是这样，解放前通货膨胀，钱拿的不少，可是维持不住生活，往往今天发了薪，明天就打折扣。现在的薪金维持一家生活绰有富裕，所以能在银行存款。
    这不是生活提高是什么？储安平把共产党的领导说成是“党天下”，这是很错误的。我们要看清一个大前提：保护工人阶级的利益、社会主义的利益。不能说党的领导就是党的包办。而且，任何一个单位都有党外人士参加领导，只要你的意见符合广大人民的利益，党就会采纳，只要你有能力，肯工作，党是很重视、很依靠的。我在本厂就是一例：刚解放时，我是炼铁车间的工程师，后来做了炼铁科长、高炉技师、车间副主任，现在是厂的副总工程师。我不明白储安平说的一个部门安插一个党员负责有什么坏处。我们厂里几个部门的党员负责干部和非党负责干部都能团结合作，目的是把工作搞好。现在提出排斥党员干部负责，用意究竟何在呢？
    医务主任陈登堂说：我觉得报纸既然让葛佩琦、储安平这些人鸣，也应该让我们鸣一鸣，把我们的意见发表发表。储安平一会儿承认党的领导，一会儿又说不让党员领导，这叫人怎么做？这是自相矛盾，不能自圆其说。储安平还说：“在全国范围内，不论大小单位，甚至一个科一个组，都要安排一个党员做头儿……形成了现在这样一个一家天下的清一色局面。”他这话完全歪曲了事实。我们可以算一算：在工厂、机关、学校里，究竟是党员领导干部多？还是非党员领导干部多？我是个医务工作者，拿我们卫生部门的领导来说吧：卫生部长不是党员，北京市卫生局局长也不是党员；市立医院的领导人，有多少是党员，有多少不是党员，也可以算一算，这很能说明问题。储安平说，党员领导干部的才能和他们担任的职务不相称。这种情况很可能有。但我们还可以看看，非党员领导干部的才能，难道没有和他的职位不相称的？储安平说，现在是“党天下”，我看不是这样。古今中外有那个政党，能够这样发动大家提意见？光这一点就能说明储安平的看法是错误的。
    技监科副科长曹修仁说：这次帮助党整风，大多数人的意见都提得好，但是葛佩琦、储安平、李康年这些人的意见离开了社会主义的利益。我们工人懂得，共产党领导人民，经历千辛万苦，争来了这个社会主义，这多不容易。我们拥护共产党，我们坚持社会主义。有人说，资产阶级已经没有两面性，不必再改造了。可是李康年想把利息拿二十年，又想摘掉资产阶级帽子。章乃器说定息不是剥削，是不劳而获的收入。就凭这些话，正说明他们还得好好地改造一下。储安平表面承认共产党领导，实际是想取消共产党领导。他过去是干什么的，他为社会主义事业作过什么贡献，我不知道。可是，他今天竟攻击起共产党员做领导干部来了。这成什么话！我们工人阶级是领导阶级，工人阶级就是通过自己的政党，通过党的负责干部来领导的。他不让共产党参加各部门的领导工作，那么谁来领导呢？我看党员们的领导绝大部分是称职的。解放以来，不论工业、农业、文化教育工作，都有很大成绩，几年作了反动统治时期几十年、几百年做不到的事情，有良心的人谁都不能否认这个事实，我们为什么不拥护共产党的领导呢？
    百家争鸣好的很，我们工人阶级也要鸣一鸣。今天是个开头，我们还要继续鸣，直到把真理鸣出来为止。
