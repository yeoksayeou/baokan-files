　　The Inescapable Predicament
　　Yì Zhēn
    After the broadcast of Khrushchev's television interview with the American "Columbia Broadcasting System" reporter, it immediately caused a sensation in the United States. On June 3 alone, ten million Americans saw and heard this interview on television. Moreover, because it was so popular, broadcasting companies in Britain, Australia, Sweden, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and many cities in the United States requested rebroadcasts or repeats. This unprecedented popularity was indeed, as the "Columbia Broadcasting System" spokesperson said, "the greatest news broadcast in the history of fixed television radio programs."

    The Failure of the Cold War Policy
    The first appearance of a Soviet leader on American television and its remarkable success is a not insignificant failure of the American ruling group's Cold War policy. In the post-war years, the American ruling group has tried its best to hinder exchanges and mutual understanding between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, and has used its propaganda machine to distort and mislead the American people's sight and hearing of the Soviet Union. However, the American public is willing to understand the Soviet Union. The "New York Herald Tribune's" radio and television commentator, Crosby, pointed out in his comments on Khrushchev's television interview: "The very fact that we want to hear Khrushchev speak, and he is willing to talk to us, is of great significance." Through this television broadcast, the American public discovered that Khrushchev was "an amiable, intelligent, and confident man" (American television magazine "Variety" weekly), he spoke "very frankly," and was not "menacing" ("New York Herald Tribune"), on the contrary, he was "very pleasing" (Associated Press), especially his talk "obviously held a conciliatory attitude, especially on the issue of arms limitation." The ordinary Americans, who have been deceived for a long time, of course felt extra joy because they were able to see and hear the demeanor and words of Soviet leaders for the first time in many years. Even the "New York Times" television commentator, Gould, could not help but admit: "For ordinary Americans, this broadcast was a moment of exhilarating revelation."

    This broadcast, which ordinary Americans found exhilarating, embarrassed the American ruling group. Because Khrushchev put forward many sincere and moving peace proposals in his talk, the implementation of which could ease the international situation, promote Soviet-American relations, and peaceful coexistence, which is what ordinary Americans sincerely desire, but what the American ruling group deeply abhors. How could the American ruling group not be extremely annoyed by this? In the words of "Washington Post" commentator Max Lerner, Washington's diplomats have been "caught in a vortex of fear and anger" due to Khrushchev's talk.

    A Plan to "Turn the Guest into the Host"
    American public opinion demands that Khrushchev's peace proposals be carefully considered. However, the American ruling group is unwilling to accept the Soviet peace proposals, and also wants to find a way to escape the predicament it is in. This is of course very difficult. However, the Democratic leader of the United States Senate, Johnson, finally came up with a clever plan to "turn the guest into the host," that is, to demand that the Soviet Union also allow American leaders to appear on Soviet radio or television. On June 8, he said very complacently: "Let us (referring to the American ruling group, same below) use Khrushchev's method to deal with him." "We should insist on obtaining the right to state our position on disarmament issues in detail to the Soviet people"; "We should appear on Soviet radio or television every week this year."

    This veteran American Democrat really thought that he had caught Khrushchev by the pigtail this time. In his opinion, this would not only enable the American ruling group to escape from its predicament, but also embarrass the Soviet Union. Therefore, he raised this proposal again on June 10, and directly challenged Khrushchev, saying: "If Khrushchev rejects this proposal, please let him explain to the world why he rejects it."

    American Secretary of State Dulles greatly appreciated Johnson's clever plan. At a press conference on June 11, he praised Johnson's suggestion and believed that it demonstrated the "bipartisan nature" of American foreign policy. This American diplomatic head, who was called a "reckless gambler" by the American press, could not help but want to personally make a grab for it again. Therefore, he even said that if he himself went to broadcast on Soviet radio, there was "nothing to object to."

    It seems that allowing American leaders to appear on Soviet radio or television, on the American side, this "check" is definitely going to be "mated" to the Soviet Union.

    Another Disgrace
    However, Johnson and Dulles not only failed to "mate" the Soviet Union's "check," but instead made themselves look ugly again.

    Because, the Soviet Union had already sent invitations to at least three American senators before Khrushchev gave his television talk, inviting them to express their opinions on the Moscow Radio program on banning nuclear weapons tests. Perhaps due to being carried away by success, or perhaps the American State Department's intelligence system had another problem this time, Johnson and Dulles did not know about this when they were clamoring to allow American leaders to appear on Soviet radio. This was already somewhat ridiculous.

    If things only developed to this point, it would not be surprising. Especially if Johnson's three colleagues "used the trick against the trick" and accepted the Soviet invitation, then it could somewhat save face for Johnson and Dulles. However, none of these three American senators was willing to do so. It was not that the three of them were unwilling to help Johnson and Dulles, but according to the United Press International, it was because Dulles' State Department was "very opposed" to them broadcasting on Soviet radio. Such actions by the State Department would not be possible without Dulles' consent. But in this way, Dulles exposed his ugliness to the fullest.

    Dulles, after expressing his willingness to broadcast on Soviet radio, had to let the State Department prevent American senators from doing so. What is the reason for this? Dulles did not make any public explanation on this point. However, people can imagine that this is because the United States' position on banning nuclear weapons tests is shameful. Dulles would rather lose face himself than let American senators broadcast on Soviet radio, indicating that he still has some self-awareness in this regard.

    However, from this, people can see that as long as the American ruling group continues to pursue the foreign policy that has plunged them into a predicament, then no matter how hard they try, they will not be able to escape this predicament. And this is the fundamental reason why Johnson and Dulles backfired.

　　逃不脱的困境
　　亦真
    赫鲁晓夫对美国“哥伦比亚广播公司”记者发表的电视谈话放映后，立即轰动全美。仅在6月3日那一天，就有一千万美国人在电视中看到和听到了这个谈话。并且，由于它如此受人欢迎，英国、澳大利亚、瑞典、加拿大、古巴、墨西哥的广播公司，以及美国的许多城市都曾要求转播或重播。这种空前的盛况，的确如“哥伦比亚广播公司”的发言人所说的，是“固定电视无线电节目中最伟大的一次新闻广播。”
    冷战政策的失败
    苏联领导人在美国的电视广播中第一次露面，并获得非凡的成功，这是美国统治集团的冷战政策的一个不小的失败。美国统治集团在战后的年代中，竭力阻碍苏美两国人民的往来和相互了解，并利用他们的宣传机器进行歪曲宣传，来蒙蔽美国人民对苏联的视听。但是，美国公众是愿意了解苏联的。“纽约先驱论坛报”的广播和电视评论员克罗斯比在评论赫鲁晓夫的电视谈话时指出：“我们希望听到赫鲁晓夫讲话，而他又愿意和我们谈话，这件事本身就有很大的意义。”通过这次电视广播，美国公众发现赫鲁晓夫是“一个和蔼的、聪明而又自信的人”（美国电视刊物“剧艺”周刊），他说话“很直率”，而且并不是“气势凶凶的”（“纽约先驱论坛报”），相反的是“很能使人高兴”的（美联社），特别是他的谈话“显然抱着和解的态度，特别是在限制军备问题上。”久被蒙蔽的普通的美国人由于他们能够多年来第一次看到和听到苏联领导人的风采和言论，当然分外感到喜悦。连美国“纽约时报”的电视评论员戈尔德也不能不承认：“对普通的美国人来说，这次广播是令人振奋的启示的时刻”。
    这个使普通的美国人感到振奋的广播，却使美国统治集团感到难堪。因为，赫鲁晓夫在谈话中提出了许多真诚的、动人心弦的和平建议，实现这些建议就可以缓和国际局势、促进苏美关系和和平共处，这正是普通的美国人衷心渴望的，而却是美国统治集团深为厌恶的。美国统治集团怎能不对此十分恼怒呢？用“华盛顿邮报”评论员马克思·勒纳的话来说，华盛顿的外交家们已由于赫鲁晓夫的谈话而“陷于恐惧和愤怒的漩涡”中了。
    “反客为主”之计
    美国舆论要求慎重考虑赫鲁晓夫的和平建议。但是，美国统治集团不肯接受苏联的和平建议，而又要想办法摆脱自己所处的窘境。这当然是很困难的。然而，美国参议院民主党领袖约翰逊终于想出了一条“反客为主”的妙计，那就是要求苏联也允许美国的领导人物在苏联的广播或电视中出现。他在6月8日十分得意地说：“让我们（指美国统治集团，下同）用赫鲁晓夫的办法来对付他。”“我们应该坚持要求得到向苏联人民详细地陈述我们在裁军问题上的立场的权利”；“我们在今年应该每周在苏联的电台或电视中露面。”
    这个老资格的美国民主党人，真以为这下子他可抓住赫鲁晓夫的小辫子了。照他看来，这样一来，不但可以使美国统治集团从窘境中逃脱，而且还会使苏联受窘。所以，他在6月10日又一次提出这个主张，并且直接向赫鲁晓夫叫阵说：“如果赫鲁晓夫拒绝这项建议，就请他向全世界解释为什么拒绝。”
    美国国务卿杜勒斯是十分欣赏约翰逊的这条妙计的。他在6月11日的记者招待会上赞扬了约翰逊的建议，并且认为这表明了美国外交政策的“两党性质”。这个被美国报刊称作是“轻率的赌徒”的美国外交首脑，这回不禁又想要亲自出马捞它一把。因此，他甚至表示，如果他自己在苏联的电台上去进行广播，也是没有“甚么可反对的”。
    看来，让美国的领导人物在苏联的电台或电视中出现，在美国这一方面来说，这个“军”是肯定要向苏联“将”的了。
    又一次丢丑
    但是，约翰逊和杜勒斯不但没有“将”成苏联的“军”，反而使自己又丢了一次丑。
    因为，苏联早在赫鲁晓夫发表电视谈话之前，就已向至少三位美国参议员发出邀请，要他们在莫斯科广播电台关于禁止核武器试验的节目中发表他们的意见。不知是由于得意忘形了，还是美国国务院的情报系统这次又出了什么毛病，约翰逊和杜勒斯在大嚷大叫地要求让美国的领导人物在苏联的电台上露面时，竟没有知道这件事。这样就已经使人感到有些滑稽了。
    如果事情仅只发展到这个地步，还不足为奇。特别是如果约翰逊的三位同僚“将计就计”，接受苏联的邀请，那么，还可以多少为约翰逊和杜勒斯挽回点面子。可是，这三位美国参议员竟没有一个人肯这样干。这倒不是他们三位不愿意为约翰逊和杜勒斯帮场，而据合众社的消息说，是由于杜勒斯的国务院“非常反对”他们在苏联的电台上广播。国务院的这种做法，不得到杜勒斯的同意是不可能的。但是，这样一来，杜勒斯却使他自己丑态毕露了。
    杜勒斯在自己表示愿意在苏联的电台上广播之后，又不得不让国务院去阻止美国的参议员去这样做，这是什么道理呢？杜勒斯对这一点没有作任何公开的交代。但是，人们可以想像得到，这是由于美国在禁止核武器试验问题上的立场是见不得人的。杜勒斯宁愿自己丢人，也不肯让美国的参议员在苏联的电台上去广播，表明在这一方面他多少还有些自知之明。
    可是，人们由此可以看出，美国统治集团只要继续奉行使他们已经陷入困境的外交政策，那么，不管他们怎样想方设法，他们都无法逃出这种困境的。而这正是约翰逊和杜勒斯所以弄巧成拙的根本原因所在。
