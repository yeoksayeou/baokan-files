　　Hussein and his party returned to the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the 24th.

　　伊拉克和约旦国王联合公报
    强调遵守双方军事性条约
    据新华社25日讯  巴格达消息：伊拉克国王费萨尔和约旦国王侯赛因在巴格达举行了三天谈判后在6月24日发表了联合公报。公报强调说：这两个哈希姆王朝的君主重申他们要遵守伊拉克和约旦在1947年缔结的关于政治、防务、经济和文化合作的友好同盟条约。
    这项为期十年的条约规定，两国应互派军事使团和从事联合军事训练；两国不在任何有违缔约一方的利益的问题上同第三国达成任何谅解或协议；一旦遭受第三方的侵略，两国即就联合防御问题进行磋商；一旦两国中有一国发生地方性骚乱，缔约双方应即行合作以压平骚乱。
    公报还说：“他们宣布了要抵抗颠复活动和威胁独立的一切危险的决心。”
    公报同时又表示两国要坚持阿拉伯联盟宪章和阿拉伯防御公约的原则。
    公报没有提到伊拉克对约旦的财政援助问题。有消息说，侯赛因这次访问的主要目的就是要探明伊拉克能够向约旦提供七百五十万英镑财政援助中的多大一部分。
    侯赛因一行已经在24日回到约旦首都安曼。
