　　On "Rigidity"
　　He Ming
　　Whenever "rigidity" is mentioned, some people readily associate it with "virtue" and the heroic spirit of "unyielding to force." Perhaps it is for this reason that some people, after being criticized for publishing anti-socialist fallacies, have trotted out the term "rigidity" in an attempt to deceive the public. They hope that the people will be deceived and see them as towering heroes.
　　What is "rigidity"? Is "rigidity" good? - Just like the words "good" and "bad," different classes have different understandings. Is the realization of land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries good or bad? In the eyes of the people, it is "very good"; in the eyes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan, it is "very bad" and the "greatest evil." The elimination of capitalism and the construction of socialism are the same; such a great thing is naturally considered "utterly evil" by those who stubbornly stand on the bourgeois position.
　　The abstract term "rigidity" also has different connotations for each class. The bourgeoisie regards resolutely opposing socialism as "rigidity"; the working class regards resolutely realizing communism, fearing no difficulties or dangers, as rigidity. It is correct for those who persist in anti-socialist words and deeds to say that they have "rigidity"; however, this kind of "rigidity" is called "stubbornness" in the people's dictionary. Why? Because they are resisting the objective laws of historical development. In both kinds of "rigidity," there is a refusal to bow the head even unto death; however, the "rigidity" of those who oppose socialism is a refusal to bow the head to the truth. Wouldn't it be fair to give them a hat of stubbornness? As for the degree of "stubbornness," that can be discussed separately.
　　The fact that those who publish anti-socialist fallacies are still considered to be within the ranks of the people, and that this contradiction is treated as a contradiction among the people, is because their anti-socialism still has a boundary with imperialism, that is to say, it has not yet reached that degree of "rigidity"; those who advocate "rigidity" may not be "rigid" to the end. What if "rigidity" is added to "rigidity," and it is "rigid" to the end? Then, that must be discussed separately.
　　"Rigidity" is not a life-saving trump card. Using this "trump card" to persist in opposing socialism may still have some mobilizing effect for the bourgeois elements, but it is mobilizing them to walk into a mud pit.
　　A mantis's arm cannot stop a chariot. The wheel of history cannot be stopped by anything. As the wheel rolls over, the people on the chariot reach out to pull them onto the chariot, but the chariot-blockers shake their heads and raise their arms, shouting "Rigidity is here!" As a result, "rigidity" to the end, its future is self-evident!

### 论“刚性”

　　论“刚性”
　　何明
    一提到“刚性”，有些人就很容易把它和“美德”，和“威武不能屈”的英雄气概联系起来。大概就是因为这个缘故吧，有人发表反社会主义谬论而受到批判之后，就抬出了“刚性”这个词儿，以招摇上市。他们希望，人民会被欺骗，把他们看作顶天立地的英雄。
    什么是“刚性”？“刚性”好不好？——这就和“好”“坏”这两个词儿一样，不同阶级的人是有不同理解的。实现土地改革、镇压反革命，是好？是坏？在人民看来是“好得很”；在台湾的国民党反动派看来是“坏得很”，而且是“最大的罪恶”。消灭资本主义、建设社会主义这件事，也是这样；这样天大的好事，顽固的站在资产阶级立场的人，自然也认为是“万恶”的。
    “刚性”这个抽象的词儿，各个阶级也是各有各的内容的。资产阶级以坚决反对社会主义为“刚性”；工人阶级以坚决实现共产主义、不畏任何困难和危险为刚性。坚持反社会主义言行的人，说他们自己有“刚性”，也是对的；但是，这种“刚性”在人民的字典里却叫作“顽固性”。为什么？因为他们反抗的是历史发展的客观规律。两种“刚性”，宁死不低头者一也；然而，反社会主义的人的“刚性”，却是对于真理的死不低头。这，给他们戴一顶顽固性的帽子，不算冤枉吧！至于“顽固”到什么程度，那是可以另作别论的。
    现在把发表反社会主义谬论的人，还算在人民之内，把这种矛盾作为人民内部的矛盾来处理。就是因为他们的反社会主义和帝国主义还有界限，也就是说还没有“刚”到那个程度；提倡“刚性”的人也可能不“刚”到底。如果“刚”上加“刚”，而且“刚”到底呢？那末，也要另作别论了。
    “刚性”并不是一张救命的王牌。用这张“王牌”坚持反社会主义，也许对于资产阶级分子还多少有点动员作用，然而，却是动员起来向泥坑走的。
    螳臂那能挡车。历史的车轮是任何东西也挡不住的。车轮辗过来了，车上的人伸出手来要拉他们上车，而挡车者竟摇头举臂高呼“刚性在此！”结果，“刚”到底，其前途不言可知矣！
