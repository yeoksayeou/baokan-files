　　Wolf!—Wolf?
　　Qiu Yang
    On the scorching sand, a small worm is besieged by a group of ants; pain causes it to constantly curl up its body. It tries hard to shake off one ant, but another bites it. Thus, in the constant gnawing, it rolls and struggles…. The Japanese film "Wolf" uses such a startling opening to immediately bring the audience into a similarly burning, angry state of mind.

    In a society where the system of cannibalism has not yet been eliminated, true tragedy often exists within an absurd but real logic. Imagine, a group of hungry unemployed people who regard even a meager lunch as a treasure are burdened with such a responsibility – to persuade people in the same situation as them to take out life insurance! Thus, there emerges such a scene: a consumptive patient, soaked in heavy clothes, asks his children a serious but also painful question: "If I join the insurance, will they give money even if I commit suicide?"

    To die, or to live? Should always be a question worthy of serious consideration in life, but when suicide is the only alternative to robbery in order to survive, the full cruelty of life is exposed, isn’t it? However, when several unemployed people choose the latter path for themselves, and even more so for their loved ones, "public opinion" says they are "wolves"! "Wolves"? Who exactly are the wolves? The film answers this question.

    All the staff involved in the production should be deeply respected. In exposing this man-eating social scene, the strict, unembellished strokes they adopted to depict reality, especially the simple and authentic style of acting, give this film an extremely strong power of infection.

    The task of revealing who the real "wolves" are is accomplished by depicting the different but similar experiences of five different characters – two widows with children, a demobilized soldier, an auto mechanic, and a screenwriter. The reason they all encounter the fate of being on the verge of death is because of their ordinariness and kindness; the reason they all embark on the path of becoming robbers is because they cannot adapt to that society. Their superior – the head of the life insurance company, Minister Hashimoto, excellently defines this society: "Now is the time when if you don't eat others, others will eat you!" They refuse to eat people, so they become "wolves"! And are imprisoned! Are there such "wolves"?

    Among the five people, none of them became robbers solely for themselves; even after becoming robbers, the true dignity of being human was not extinguished because of this. Yano Akiko "robbed" medical expenses for her son, Mikawa bought some books for his children, Yoshikawa redeemed clothes for his son-in-law and daughter, Fujibayashi Tomie gave her children a full meal, and Harashima only robbed a divorce fee for his wife. In the long life of a person, perhaps these should only be extremely ordinary trivial matters, but when a person who is awe-inspiring in his responsibility as a parent and husband has to take risks and become a robber in order to solve these problems! The greater sorrow lies in the fact that they all have the shame and disgust that an honest and kind person should have. After robbing a meager amount of money, they not only have nowhere to pour out their inner pain, but even dare not look at each other. Not because of fear, but because of inner guilt! One of them, a mother, Fujibayashi Tomie, after feeding her children a full meal, took her children on a yacht and jumped into Tokyo Bay! Her suicide note to her friends: "We had a very happy day!" What a bloody and tearful picture that one cannot bear to look at!

    True, for that society, suicide is at most a protest, and robbery is just a struggle. The road to fundamentally changing society is not here, and the film does not offer any encouraging prospects. But I do not blame this film for being weak. Works depicting the darkness of the bourgeoisie are not necessarily insignificant, because in such a society, the emergence of such accusatory works containing infinite anger itself has profound significance.

### 狼！—狼？

　　狼！—狼？
　　丘扬
    炽热的沙砾上，一条小虫被一群蚂蚁围攻着；疼痛使它不断地蜷起身体。它努力地摆开了一个蚂蚁，但另一个又咬住了它。就这样，在不断地啮食中，它在翻滚、挣扎……。日本影片“狼”以这样一个触目惊心的片头，一下子把观众带进一个同样烧灸、愤怒的心境之中。
    在依然没有消灭掉人吃人制度的社会里，真正的悲剧往往存在于一种荒唐但却又真实的逻辑之中。试想，连对一顿简陋的午饭都被视为至宝的一群饥饿的失业者，竟然负起了这样一种责任——劝告一些与他们同样境遇的人去参加人寿保险！于是，就出现了这样一种景象：一个汗透重衣的肺痨患者，当着自己的孩子，严肃但也惨痛地向他们提出了一个问题：“要是加入保险，自杀死了也给钱吗？”
    死，还是活着？永远应该是人生中值得严肃思考的问题，但到了除却自杀便只有做强盗才能活下去的时候，生活的全部冷酷性该是暴露无遗了吧？然而当几个失业者为了自己、更多地是为了自己的亲人选择了后一条路的时候，“舆论”却在说他们是“狼”！“狼”？到底谁是狼呢？影片回答了这个问题。
    参加摄制工作的全体人员，应该受到深深的尊敬。在揭露这一片吃人的社会景象时，他们所采取的严正的毫不粉饰现实的笔触、特别是在表演上所特具的质朴的真实风格，使这部影片具备了极其强烈的感染力量。
    揭示谁是真正的“狼”这一任务，是通过描绘了五个不同的人物——两个有子女的寡妇、一个复员军人、一个汽车修理工和一个电影编剧家的不同但又相同的遭遇来完成的。他们之所以共同遭遇到濒于死亡的命运，是因为他们的平凡和善良；他们之所以共同走上了当强盗的路，是因为他们适应不了那个社会。他们的上级——人寿保险公司的桥本部长出色地为这个社会下了个定义：“现在是你不吃了别人，别人就吃了你的时候！”他们不肯去吃人，于是就变成了“狼”！而被关进监牢！有这样的“狼”吗？
    五个人当中，没有一个人是单为了自己才去做强盗的；即使做了强盗之后，真正的做人的尊严也并没因此而泯灭。矢野秋子为她的儿子“抢”出了医药费，三川为他的孩子们买了点书，吉川为女婿女儿赎出了衣服，藤林富枝让她的孩子们吃了一顿饱饭，而原岛只是为他妻子抢出了离婚费。在人的漫长一生中，也许这只应该是一些极其平常的琐事，然而当一个凛然于自己有着做父母丈夫的责任的人，为了解决这些问题，却不得不挺而走险做了强盗！更大的悲哀还在于他们都有一个作为正直善良的人所应有的羞恶之心，在抢得了少得可怜的一点钱之后，不但无处去倾诉内心的伤痛，甚至他们彼此间都不敢仰视。不是由于恐惧，而是由于内心里的歉疚！他们当中的一个为母者藤林富枝喂饱了儿女一顿饭之后，在游艇上带着孩子跳进了东京湾！遗书给她的朋友们：“这一天我们过得很快活！”这该是一幅多么血泪交迸不忍卒睹的画图啊！
    不错，对于那个社会说来，自杀顶多不过是抗议，做强盗也不过是挣扎，根本改变社会的道路并不在这里，影片也没有提出一些令人鼓舞的前景。但我并不因此就责备这部影片是乏力的。刻划资产阶级黑暗的作品未必渺小，因为在那样的社会里，像这样蕴藏无限愤怒的控诉作品的出现，本身便有着深刻的意义。
