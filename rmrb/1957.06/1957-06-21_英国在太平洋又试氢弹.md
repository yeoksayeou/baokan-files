    Britain Tests Another Hydrogen Bomb in the Pacific

    Well-informed sources in London said that due to the successful British hydrogen bomb test explosion, Prime Minister Macmillan is preparing to make new efforts to persuade the United States to exchange information on nuclear research and production.
