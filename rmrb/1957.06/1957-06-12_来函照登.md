Letters to the Editor

Editor:
    The words attributed to me in your newspaper's June 9th, third-page report regarding my remarks at the Nine-Three Society Central Committee and Beijing Branch Committee's rectification forum differ considerably from my original statement. I said at the time: "Some old intellectuals are beginning to show signs of arrogance, and we ourselves should be vigilant." "There is a distance between our thoughts and feelings and those of the workers and peasants. If we compare ourselves to them, what are our personal gains and losses?" I absolutely did not say that anyone "is dissatisfied with the entire Party and is severely arrogant." Please correct this.

    Dong Weichuan

　　来函照登
　　编辑同志：
    你报6月9日第三版载我在九三学社中央和北京市分社委员座谈整风时所说的话，和我当时的原话颇有出入。我当时说：“有的旧知识分子的自高自大在露苗头，我们自己应当警惕。”“我们的思想感情和工人、农民有距离，如果和他们比较比较，个人的利害得失还有什么呢？”绝对没有说过什么人“对整个党不满意，自高自大很严重”。请惠予更正为荷。
    董渭川
