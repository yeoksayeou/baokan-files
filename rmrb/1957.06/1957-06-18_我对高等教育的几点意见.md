　　My Opinions on Higher Education
　　Professor of Peking University, Xing Qiyi
　　Since the rectification campaign began, faculty and staff at Peking University have offered many opinions to the Party in various ways. Although not all of them may be correct, the overall spirit is to treat the illness to save the patient, without harboring many personal grudges. During the climax of the opinion-giving process, except for a very few cases, no major deviations occurred. This is most sufficient to show that the prestige and strength of the Communist Party have a foundation among the broad masses of intellectuals. Some people once had various concerns, but the facts now show that this was completely unnecessary. Among these opinions, some are positive and some are negative, so some are correct (the vast majority) and some are wrong. Therefore, more in-depth debate is needed in the future to determine right and wrong, and to discern which are wrong and which are right. I now want to raise several issues for discussion and express my opinions.
    
    Regarding "Professors Running the University"

    First of all, I think the term "professors running the university" is inappropriate. During the Kuomintang era, this system was adopted to prevent some bureaucrats and party hacks from infiltrating the school and messing it up. However, as a result, many faculty meetings were still manipulated by a few people, indirectly serving the rulers. In many meetings, many teachers were wary of the system of "professors running the university." Some comrades vehemently opposed it, saying, "If the system of 'professors running the university' is restored, the revolutions of these years will have been in vain." Others said, "If it is 'professors running the university,' many teachers will have to go looking for jobs with lanterns again." It is possible that "professors running the university" played some good role in the old days. But undeniably, many people have suffered. Therefore, they deeply hate this system, and as soon as they see these four characters, they think that the old feudal bosses are about to be restored. I personally think that although there have been many problems in the work of colleges and universities in recent years, on the whole, our current system is a democratic system that is fundamentally different from the past. It is progressive, and we must not retreat to the old path of ten years ago just because we encounter difficulties.

    The vast majority of teachers, except for a few scholar-officials and rulers, lived in poverty and were oppressed before liberation. They symbolized a group of friends wearing blue cloth jackets, carrying broken satchels, and crowding onto trams. In addition to being oppressed by life, because they had knowledge, they also recognized the reasons for their poverty. Therefore, they spontaneously approached the Communist Party. Before and after liberation, intellectuals welcomed the Communist Party with unparalleled enthusiasm, celebrating the arrival of their own liberation. In recent years, individual Party members have adopted crude methods to transform intellectuals. For example, some individuals used abusive language to treat intellectuals, which many people found intolerable. It seemed that intellectuals and the Communist Party were gradually becoming estranged, and there was a layer of dark clouds between them. But does this mean that the intellectuals have changed their minds and no longer place their hopes on the Party? I think that is not the case at all. Intellectuals are very clear that the Communist Party led the people of the whole country to overthrow powerful enemies, enabling the country to stand up again. The achievements of national construction in recent years and the improvement of the country's status have made intellectuals naturally and rationally realize that if the Communist Party does not lead China, who will lead China? If the Party collapses, it would be unthinkable.

    Since intellectuals have entrusted the Party with the arduous task of revitalizing the country, do they still not trust the Party to run these few universities well? And must they entrust this task to a few professors? At least I don't have this idea, and I dare say that except for a very few people with ulterior motives, the vast majority of intellectuals do not have this idea either. Last month, I talked in the People's Daily about whether the Party can lead science. I think my opinion can also be applied to the question of whether the Party can lead the university. Definitely, it can not only lead, but also strengthen leadership. In the past, it was precisely because the leadership was not specific and the boundaries were not clear that many adverse consequences were caused today.

    The so-called Party leadership in schools is to ensure the completion of the Party's policies ideologically. As for how to implement specific policies, it should be discussed by the school affairs committee, and then the president should notify the implementation. I personally think that the three parties cooperating well is a very democratic system. For example, taking learning from the Soviet Union as an example, this general principle is the Party's policy, and the school Party committee must ideologically instill in students and staff some knowledge about the achievements of Soviet education and science, so that they have a deep understanding of the Soviet Union. As for whether to implement the Soviet five-point system or oral examination system in schools, the Party committee should not directly make a decision, but should be decided by a majority of the school affairs committee members, and then implemented by the president if it is passed. In the past few years, the Party committee has done many things that exceeded its authority and many things that it did not understand (for example, it is impossible to ask the Party committee to decide whether oral examinations should be implemented, only experienced teachers can decide based on the specific situation), thus causing confusion. Some people inevitably feel a little dissatisfied with this situation and make a few complaints, saying, "He doesn't understand, but he still wants to manage," which is very natural, but a small number of people who call themselves "loving the Party" provoke discord from it, saying that the Party cannot lead science, cannot lead the school, etc. In fact, most of the people who complain have never had this idea. The school Party committee also made a big mistake, that is, the mass line was not followed enough. Originally, the Party should reflect the opinions of the masses to the administration, and then, after comprehensive research, arrange the policy guidelines. If the opinions come from the masses and then return to the masses, it should be as smooth as sailing. What is feared is that the policy does not match the demands of the masses, and it is forced down with force, and the result is that it does not work and hits a snag. The lessons learned from the implementation of the workload system in colleges and universities in the past two years is a clear proof. If we had sounded out the masses beforehand, we would not have made such a mistake.

    Regarding Political Class

    During this movement, there was a common opinion among the students, that is, dissatisfaction with the political class. A large number of people asked for exemption from the exam. I think this is a serious issue that deserves our deep consideration. After liberation, both students and teachers realized that this was an earth-shaking change, and therefore spontaneously demanded a more comprehensive understanding of the revolutionary history, political economy, and other issues of the new society. Intellectuals engaged in political study and ideological transformation on a voluntary basis. Many people regard the self-criticisms of intellectuals during the Three-Anti Campaign as being forced or pretended, and I think this view is not very correct. It is true that a small number of intellectuals are somewhat distant from the Party, but the vast majority believe that Party members have a noble character and measure themselves by this standard. In comparison, they will naturally feel that the past life was empty and that they did not do much for the people. In this mood of self-shame and self-improvement, they bravely exposed themselves and criticized themselves, to show that from that time on, they would follow the Party and truly be a person who serves the people.

    The current problem with the political class, does it mean that intellectuals have become indifferent to politics? I think not at all. I personally feel that the political atmosphere of teachers and students has indeed been very weak in recent years. This is a fact, but the desire of most intellectuals to make progress has not diminished slightly, and they feel that they have spent a lot of time and made considerable efforts in their studies in recent years. I have personally seen gray-haired old professors participate in political class exams and discussions, and students often spend several hours for a group discussion. They calculate for themselves that they put in a lot of effort, but there is no reward. Therefore, they can't help but ask in their hearts, what is the problem with our study? Is the current way of learning a correct way? Our political teachers, although subjectively making great efforts, are limited by their own experience and lack of cultivation, and dare not easily express their own opinions. As a result, they can only talk about some articles of faith in class, which will naturally make people feel why they should take the class, and how is this different from reading a book? In addition to this, coupled with various rules and regulations, such as combining with reality, teaching plans, complying with progress, etc., were originally good things, but as a result, they were bound and became full-fledged dogmatic forms. Therefore, for a period of time, students had the most opinions about the Marxism-Leninism teaching and research section. I heard that individual political class teachers have expressed the opinion that political class is a living thing and must be combined with the current situation to compile teaching materials. I think this opinion is very correct.

    Through this movement, it is equivalent to issuing a strong warning to the political classes of colleges and universities across the country. Political class is an indispensable part of education in the new society, and its role should be higher than that of other courses. However, in terms of the current effect, although it is not equal to complete failure, at least the effectiveness is not very high. If the government does not pay attention to this matter and does not transfer a group of people with very high levels to comprehensively study the future methods of political class, but only entrusts this matter to a few political teachers in the school, this will make the education of the new society lose its soul. Therefore, I think this is a problem that needs to be solved urgently in higher education.

    I feel that the revolutionary history and political and economic changes of these years should be a series of the most vivid materials, with endless content, and is the most interesting course, but the result is just the opposite, making people feel empty reciting dogmas and empty. This has a lot to do with our teaching materials and teaching methods. For example, in political economy, we only hear some terms such as "surplus value," but there is no vivid report on the economy of our country's farmers before and after liberation. Teachers only diligently want to talk about which chapter today and which chapter tomorrow to complete their teaching plan. I am afraid they have not thought about whether they should organize a group of people to talk with farmers or organize an investigation team, or hold a debate to discuss a problem. The improvement of political study does not lie in empty talk about grand principles, but in having a more correct understanding and analysis of the little things around us. Why must political class be a large class, rigidly lecturing on four courses, to be considered the completion of political study? Personally experiencing the improvement of farmers' lives and seeing the increase in our industry, is this not better political education?

    Reform of the Academic System

    Many people have criticized the reform of the academic system by the Ministry of Higher Education. I think the attempt to reform is always good, but no reform can immediately see results, and it must take a period of time to reach a conclusion. In recent years, many of the mistakes of the Ministry of Higher Education have not been in issuing reform orders, but in being fickle. One order followed another, and they often conflicted with each other. For example, the university suddenly changed from a four-year system to a three-year system, and then soon changed to a five-year system. Several reforms left teachers at a loss. Any reform must first have its own views, and then persevere to seek the final right and wrong. After the teachers have expressed their opinions this time, the Ministry of Higher Education seems to want to change its previous style and wants to deny everything from the past all at once. I think this is too hasty. For example, in the past, administrative power was too concentrated, and now it advocates decentralization, but will decentralization be achieved overnight? Is there nothing to be gained from centralization at all? I think the Ministry of Higher Education has not considered these issues enough, and it is still a sudden and erratic approach.

    In the reform of the academic system, the leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education only indulged in some figures and were complacent. As soon as they encountered difficulties, they immediately retreated. For example, in recent years, we have only heard the Ministry of Higher Education talk about how many new schools have been added, how many majors there are, how many teaching outlines there are, how many research topics there are, and so on. This only shows a concrete manifestation of the leadership's fondness for greatness and success, paying attention to pomp, and not seeking reality. I feel that since liberation, since entering the city, some Party members have become infected with a very bad habit, which is to put on airs and pay attention to face. Often, before a staff member has been found, a large building is built, which has nothing in common with seeking truth from facts and working diligently, but is the decadent thinking of the bourgeoisie at work.

    Not only the higher education departments, but also various institutions have committed this problem to varying degrees. To give a small example, every time I pass the Beijing Hotel at night, I can't help but feel both happy and afraid. I am happy that the Beijing Hotel was a place of debauchery before liberation, and today it has returned to the hands of the people as a place to entertain guests and banquets. I am afraid that when the lights are on and the cars are flowing, it is said that banquets are held with dozens or hundreds of tables, which is too extravagant. I often wonder if such large-scale banquets are completely necessary. I certainly don't understand the etiquette of hospitality, and perhaps cocktail parties and champagne are necessary. But if our friends are really sympathetic to us, even if the wine is a little worse and there are fewer people, they will not blame us, or they may be even more moved. The etiquette of communication, I think, is not immutable, and we can also use our brains. I heard that a small number of factories cannot start work for a long time because the plan is too large. Is this also a mistake of putting on airs? I would like to mention in passing that although using the construction of large reservoirs to cure the Yellow River is a great plan, it seems worthwhile to carefully consider whether it is the only way at present (such as soil and water conservation in the upper reaches, etc.). I heard that many water conservancy experts do not agree with this method.

    I wholeheartedly support the current proposed austerity movement. In the next period of time, we must rely on our savings to accumulate a part of the funds to complete our industrial construction. Therefore, materials will not be too abundant, and there will probably be a long-term phenomenon of few monks and little porridge. Intellectuals must not only contribute their knowledge to complete the great construction cause, but also tighten their belts and actively join hands with the broad masses of workers and peasants to advance together.

### 我对高等教育的几点意见

　　我对高等教育的几点意见
　　北京大学教授　邢其毅
    自从整风运动开展以来，北京大学教职员工们采用了各种不同的方式，向党提出了许多意见，虽然不一定都正确，但总的精神却是治病救人，并没有夹杂了很多个人的恩怨。在整个提意见的过程高潮中，除极个别的外，没有发生什么很大的偏差，这一点最足以说明共产党的威信和力量，在知识分子的广大群众中，是有基础的。有些人曾经有过种种的顾虑，现在事实说明，这完全是没有必要的。在这些意见中，有正面的，有反面的，因此也就有的是对的（占绝大多数），有的就是错的，因此今后要更深入的争辩，才能判明是非，究竟那些是错的，那些是对的。我现在要提出几个问题加以讨论，并表示我的意见。
    关于“教授治校”
    我首先觉得“教授治校”这个名词就不妥当。在国民党时代，怕一些官僚和党棍子们混入学校，把学校搞糟，才采取了这种制度。但其结果，许多教授会还是操纵在少数人手中，间接地为统治者服务。在多次的会议中，很多教师都对“教授治校”这样一个制度怀有戒心。有的同志声色俱厉地反对，他们说“假若恢复了‘教授治校’的制度，这些年的革命算白革了”；也有的说“假若是‘教授治校’的话，许多教师们又将要打着灯笼去找饭碗了”。很可能“教授治校”在旧的时代，也起了一些好的作用。但不可否认的，许多人也吃过亏。因此对此制度，深恶痛绝，一看见这四个字，即认为旧的封建把头又将复辟了。我个人认为几年以来，高等学校中，工作上虽有很多的毛病，但总起来说，我们现在的制度是一种和以前基本不同的民主制度，它是进步的，断不能遭遇到困难，即下乔入幽，把历史的车轮退后十年，走到旧的途径上去。
    绝大多数的教师们在解放以前，除少数的学官及统治者外，都是生活穷困，受着压迫的人。他们象征着一群穿蓝布大褂，提着破书包，挤电车的朋友。他们除受生活压迫之外，由于他们有了知识，还认识到他们所以贫困的原因。因此他们自发地靠近了共产党。解放前后，知识分子曾以热烈无比的心情，欢迎着共产党，以庆祝他们自身解放的到来。近几年来，个别的党员对知识分子的改造采用了粗暴的手段。例如有个别的人采取谩骂的方式对待知识分子，很多人觉得难以容忍，好像是知识分子和共产党渐渐的疏远了，二者之间有了一层阴云，但这是不是就是说知识分子变了心，把他们的希望不再寄托于党的身上呢？我想完全不是这样的。知识分子很清楚，共产党领导了全国的人民打倒了强大的敌人，使国家重新站了起来，几年来国家建设的成就，国家地位的提高，使得知识分子从理智上自然而然地认识到：共产党不领导中国，谁领导中国？党要是垮了，真是不堪设想。
    知识分子既然把复兴国家艰巨的任务都交给党了，难道他们还不信任党会把这几个大学搞好吗？而一定要把这个任务交到几个教授的手中吗？至少我没有这种想法，我也敢说，除了极少数别有用心的人外，绝大多数的知识分子也没有这种想法。上月我在人民日报曾谈过党能不能领导科学的问题，我想我的意见也能适用于党能不能领导大学的问题。肯定地说，不但可以领导，还要加强领导。以往就是因为领导不具体，界限不分明，而造成今日许多的不良好的后果。
    所谓党在学校中的领导，是从思想上保证党的政策的完成，至于具体政策如何实施则应由校务委员会讨论，然后再由校长通知执行。我个人觉得三方面配合好了，是一种很民主的制度。譬如以学习苏联来说，这个大原则是党的政策，学校党委就要在思想上对同学、职工灌输一些有关苏联教育和科学的成就，使他们对于苏联有一深刻的认识。至于在学校中，是否推行苏联的五分制或口试制，党委就不要直接做决定，而需由多数的校务委员决定，倘若通过，再由校长实施。在以往几年中，党委作了许多超越职权的事，作了许多他们所不懂得的事（例如不可能要求党委来决定口试是否应当实行，只有由有经验的教师结合具体情况决定），因此就造成了混乱。有些人难免对这种情形有点不满意，发两句牢骚，说“他又不懂，又要管”，这本是很自然的事，但有那么一小部分自命为“爱党”的人，从中挑拨，就说成了党不能领导科学，不能领导学校等等，其实大多数发牢骚的人，何尝有过这种想法。学校党委还犯了一个大毛病，就是群众路线走得不够，本来党应向行政反映群众的意见，然后再经过综合研究，布置施政的方针，假若意见是由群众中来的，再回到群众中去，就应当如顺水行舟，毫无困难。所怕的是政策和群众要求不对口径，硬用力量往下压，结果就是行不通，碰钉子。拿这两年来高等学校施行工作量的制度所得到的教训，就是一个明证，假若事前稍微向群众摸摸底，也不致造成这样的错误。
    关于政治课
    这次运动中间，同学中有一个普遍的意见，就是对政治课不满，很大一部分人提出了免考的要求。我觉得这是一个严重的问题，值得我们深思考虑。解放以后，无论学生教师，都体会到这一次是一个翻天复地的改变，因而对新社会的革命历史，政治经济等等问题，自发地要求一个比较全面的了解。知识分子对政治学习以及思想改造等都是在自愿的原则上进行的。许多人把三反时知识分子的检讨，看成是硬压出来的或是伪装出来的，我觉得这种看法是不很正确的。诚然知识分子中也有一小部分和党有一些距离，但绝大多数的，都认为党员们具有一种高贵的品质，并且以这种标准，衡量自己，相形之下，自然会感觉到以往所过的一段生活，空虚无物，对于人民没有尽了多少力量，在这自惭形秽和自求上进的两种心情下，才勇于揭露自己，批判自己，以表示从那时起，要跟着党走，真作一个为人民服务的人民。
    目前政治课发生了问题，是不是就意味着知识分子对于政治冷淡了下来呢？我想完全不是的。我个人感觉到这几年来，教员和学生的政治空气的确很不浓厚，这是一个事实，但大多数的知识分子求进步的心情，并未稍减，而感觉到几年以来，在学习上花费了很多时间，作了相当的努力。我亲眼看见白发苍苍的老教授们参加了政治课的考试及讨论，同学们常为一次小组讨论，花费了几小时的时间。他们自己计算一下，劳力付出很多，但是没有什么代价。因此他们心里不禁要问，我们的学习的毛病出在什么地方呢？目前的学习方式是不是一种正确的方式呢？我们的政治教员，虽主观地作了很大的努力，但限于自己的经历和修养不足，不敢轻易地发表自己的意见，结果在上课时，只能谈一些条文体会，会很自然地使人们感到为什么要上课，这和看书有什么不同。除此以外，再加上各种的清规戒律，如结合实际，教学计划，遵守进度等等，本来是很好的东西，结果反而受了束缚，变成了十足的教条形式。因此有一个时期，同学们对马列主义教研室提的意见最多。听说有个别的政治课教师提过意见，认为政治课是活生生的东西，必须结合目前的现状编写教材，我看这意见很对。
    通过这次运动，等于向全国的高等学校政治课提出一个强有力的警告，政治课是新社会的教育不可缺少的一环，它的作用应当高于其它的课程之上，但以目前的效果而论，虽不等于完全失败，至少是效力很不高。政府假若再不注意此事，不调出一批水平很高的人来通盘研究今后政治课的办法，而只把这桩事情委托给学校中的几个政治教员，这就会使新社会的教育失去灵魂，因此我觉得这是目前高等教育中亟待解决的一个问题。
    我觉得这些年来的革命历史和政治经济的变化，应当是一系列最生动的材料，里头有说不尽的内容，是最有意思的一门课程，而其结果恰恰相反，使人感到空背教条，空无一物。这和我们的教材和教学方式很有关系。例如在政治经济学上，我们只听到一些“剩余价值”等等名词，但就没有一篇关于我国农民经济在解放前后的一篇生动的报告。教员只在那兢兢业业地想今天讲那一章、明天讲那一章，完成他的教学计划。恐怕也就没有想到，是否应当组织一批人和农民谈谈或组织一个调查队，或者开一个辩论会讨论一个问题。政治学习的提高不在于空谈大道理，而在于对于围绕我们的小小事物有一比较正确的认识和分析。为什么政治课一定要上大课，刻板地讲四门课，才算是完成了政治学习？亲身体会体会农民生活的提高，看一看我们工业的增产，这不是更好的政治教育吗？
    学制的改革
    许多人批评了高教部的学制改革。我认为改革的企图总是好的，但任何一种改革，不可能马上会见功效，必须经过一段时间，才能得到结论。几年以来，高教部很多的错误不在于颁布改革的命令，而在于朝三暮四，一个命令接着一个命令，而彼此往往是互相冲突的。例如大学由四年制突然改为三年制，然后不久又改为五年制。几次改革，使教师们莫知所云。任何一种改革，首先必须要有自己的看法，然后还要坚持下去，以求得最后的是非。经过这次教师们提过意见以后，高教部似乎是要一改以前的作风，想把从前的事情，一齐否定，我觉得这未免操之过急。例如以往行政权太集中，现在主张下放了，但下放是不是就一蹴而就呢？集中是否完全一无可取之处呢？我觉得这些高教部考虑得很不够，还是忽而天，忽而地的办法。
    在学制改革之中，高教部的领导人只沉醉在一些数字之中，自鸣得意，一遇见困难，又马上收兵。例如几年来，只听见高教部谈新学校增加了多少所，专业有多少个，教学大纲有多少种，研究题目有多少等等。这只说明领导上好大喜功，讲排场，不求实际的一种具体表现。我觉得自解放以后，进城以来，有些党员沾染上了一种很不好的习气，就是摆排场，讲面子。往往一个工作人员还没找到，就修起来一座大楼，这和实事求是、勤勤恳恳办事业毫无共同之处，而是资产阶级的腐朽思想在那儿作祟。
    不但高教部门如此，各个机构，都或多或少地犯了这个毛病。举一桩小事来说吧，我每当晚间走过北京饭店时，心中不禁一喜一惧。喜的是北京饭店在解放前是一个荒淫无耻的地方，今天还归人民手中，作为招待宾客宴会之所。惧的是当华灯初上，小汽车如流水，据说宴会动辄就是数十桌或数百桌，这是否是过于铺张了。我常在想，这样大规模的宴会，是否完全必要。我固然不懂招待的礼节，也许酒会香槟等等是必要的。但我们的朋友，假若是真同情我们的话，即使酒差一点，人少一点，他们也不致见怪，或者更会感动他们。交际礼节，想来也不是一丝不变的，也可以动动脑筋。听说有少数的工厂，由于计划过于庞大，以致长期不能开工，是否也是犯了摆排场的毛病。我想在此顺便提一句，用修建大型水库根治黄河，虽然是一个伟大的计划，但是否是当前唯一的办法（例如上游水土保持等）似乎值得仔细地考虑一番。听说有许多水利专家，并不同意这种办法。
    我双手赞成目前提出的节约运动。在今后的一段时间中，必须靠我们节省，积累一部分资金，来完成我们的工业建设。因此，物质不会过于丰盛，粥少僧多，恐怕是一个长期的现象。知识分子们不仅要献出他们的知识来完成伟大的建设事业，还要节衣缩食主动地和广大的工农分子携手共同前进。
