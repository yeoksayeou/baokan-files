This dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th reports: Jiangsu Province's agricultural production has entered an extremely tense stage. Summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer transplanting are taking place almost simultaneously, and some prominent problems have already emerged. If these are not resolved promptly and the farming season is missed, it will cause enormous losses.

　　Judging from the current situation, summer-ripening crops are growing well. The total output of wheat and barley (including urban suburbs) is expected to reach 7 billion jin, an increase of 500 million jin compared to last year. This year's rapeseed output is the highest since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, reaching the national plan of 170 million jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. Other summer-ripening crops such as broad beans and soybeans have also increased in yield compared to previous years. As long as there are no major climate changes, and the harvesting work is well organized to minimize losses, a comprehensive bumper harvest of summer-ripening crops is expected. However, a great deal of effort is still required to achieve this year's bumper harvest.

　Various Agricultural Tasks Concentrated
　Labor and Animal Power Feel Insufficient
　　Seizing the time for agriculture and ensuring the completion of the summer harvest and planting are decisive keys to striving for a full-year harvest. In Jiangsu Province, spring-sown and summer-planted crops account for more than 60% of the total area for the year, and planned output accounts for about 75% of the total planned output for the year. Summer has always been the busiest season for agricultural activities, with various agricultural tasks intertwined and heavy workloads. Moreover, due to excessive spring rains, insufficient sunshine, and low temperatures and high humidity this year, summer-ripening crops generally have a maturity period delayed by about ten days. This has made this year's summer harvest, summer planting, and summer transplanting time more concentrated, and labor and animal power more insufficient. Particularly in northern Jiangsu, where the vast majority is medium-maturing rice, and 1.6 million mu of dry land will be converted to paddy fields this year, the situation is particularly tense. At the same time, since the beginning of spring, draught animals have not fully recovered their condition and cannot bear the main field work. Large-scale dry land conversion to paddy field work requires an adequate water source. The water conservancy projects currently under construction are progressing slowly and are of poor quality. If irrigation is not timely, some areas' dry land conversion to paddy fields may be unsuccessful. If the planting plans for dry land conversion to paddy fields in some areas are indeed too large, it is necessary to revise the plans to avoid losses. Otherwise, even if the sowing task is completed, it will be difficult to guarantee increased production.

　Rice Seedlings Grow Poorly
　Rotting Seedlings is Quite Serious
　　Another weak link in the summer planting work is that rice seedlings are growing slowly and weakly this year, and the rotting of seedlings is quite serious. It is understood that 12 million jin of seedlings have rotted in the Yangzhou and Yancheng areas. Even in the Taihu Lake coastal area, where seedlings have never rotted in previous years, there is seedling rot this year. This widespread and large-scale seedling rot phenomenon is closely related to the trend of negating effective advanced technical measures after correcting the tendency to blindly copy in last year's agricultural technology reforms. Therefore, cultivating strong seedlings is very important, and seedling field management and other work must be greatly strengthened. At present, after discovering rotten seedlings, various localities have actively carried out seedling replacement, which should not affect transplanting.

　　It is particularly noteworthy that farmland is generally short of fertilizer this year. The Provincial Department of Agriculture believes that the main solution to the fertilizer shortage is to rely on the vast number of commune members to vigorously raise pigs for manure accumulation and to accumulate various aquatic plants and other natural fertilizers. At present, there are 7.8 million pigs raised throughout the province, and this number will continue to grow. If fertilizer can be universally increased this year under the circumstances of weak seedlings and delayed sowing season, while paying attention to strengthening field management, the possibility of achieving a comprehensive increase in agricultural production this year is still very high.

　Economic Crop Area Reduced
　Urgent Need to Increase Unit Yield
　　According to existing statistics, the rice planting area in the province will reach 37 million mu this year, which is the highest rice planting area in Jiangsu Province's history. However, many agricultural cooperatives have inappropriately reduced the area of economic crops. For example, the planned planting area for peanuts was 3.2 million mu, but only 2.7 million mu were actually planted, and cotton was also planted 500,000 mu less than planned. Judging from the current situation, strengthening the field management of existing economic crops and striving to increase yield per unit area to compensate for the possible reduction in production due to the reduction in area is an important link in striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the province.

### 不违农时，全力进行夏收夏种  江苏农忙中的问题需要抓紧解决

    不违农时，全力进行夏收夏种
    江苏农忙中的问题需要抓紧解决
    本报南京4日电　江苏省的农业生产进入了十分紧张的阶段，夏收、夏种、夏插等工作几乎是在同时期内进行，已经出现了一些突出的问题，如不及时解决，误了农时，将会造成极大损失。
    根据目前情况看来，夏熟作物生长良好，小麦、元麦的总产量（连城市郊区在内）预计可以达到七十亿斤，比去年增产五亿斤。今年油菜籽的产量是执行五年计划以来的最高产量，达到国家计划的一亿七千万斤，比去年增产五成以上。其他蚕豆、黄豆等夏熟作物也都比往年增产。只要目前的气候没有特大变化，组织好收割工作，尽力减少损失，夏熟作物可望全面丰收。但要争取今年大丰收还要作很大努力。
  各种农活集中一起
  劳力畜力都感不足
    不违农时，保证完成夏收夏种，是争取全年丰收的决定关键。江苏省春播夏种作物面积占全年总面积60％以上，计划产量占全年计划总产量75％左右。历年来夏季都是农事活动最紧张的季节，各种农活都交织在一起，任务繁重，而且由于今年春雨过多，日照不足，低温多湿，夏熟作物一般都要延迟成熟期十天左右，这就使今年的夏收、夏种、夏插时间更为集中，劳力、畜力更加不足。特别是苏北地区，绝大部分是中熟稻，今年还要把一百六十万亩旱田改为水田，显得格外紧张。同时，入春以来耕畜还没有完全复膘，不能担负主要的田间劳动。大规模的旱田改水田工作需要充足的水源，目前正在赶建的水利工程进度慢，质量不高，如果灌溉不及时，有些地区的旱田改水田就有落空的危险。有些地区的旱田改水田种植计划如果确实偏大，需要切实修改计划，以免造成损失，否则即使是完成了播种任务，也难保证增产。
  水稻秧苗生长不好
  烂秧情况相当严重
    夏种工作另一个薄弱环节是今年水稻秧苗生长缓慢而细弱，烂秧情况相当严重。据了解，扬州、盐城地区烂掉秧苗一千二百万斤，就是历年不烂秧的太湖沿岸，今年也有烂秧现象。这样面广量大的烂秧现象，是和纠正去年农业技术改革中硬搬硬套的偏向之后，不少干部群众对行之有效的先进技术措施也一概予以否定的倾向有密切关系的。因此，培养壮秧十分重要，秧田管理等工作要大大加强。目前各地在发现烂秧之后，已积极进行补秧，可不致影响栽插。
    尤其值得注意的是今年农田普遍缺乏肥料。省农业厅认为，解决肥料不足的主要办法是依靠广大社员大力养猪积肥和积聚各种水草等自然肥料。目前全省已养猪七百八十万头，而且还要继续发展。如果在今年秧苗不壮、播种季节推迟的情况下，能够普遍增施肥料，同时注意加强田间管理，争取今年农业全面增产的可能性还是很大的。
    经济作物面积缩减
  亟需提高单位产量
    据现有统计看来，今年全省的水稻种植面积将要达到三千七百万亩，这是江苏省历史上水稻种植面积最高的一年，但不少农业社不适当地缩减了经济作物的面积。如花生计划播种三百二十万亩，实际只种二百七十万亩，棉花也比计划少种了五十万亩。从现在的情况看来，加强现有经济作物的田间管理，争取提高单位面积产量，弥补因缩小面积可能形成的减产，是争取全省全面大丰收的一个重要环节。
