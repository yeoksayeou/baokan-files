    Waste Product Acquisition Should Be Priced According to Quality
    The Beijing Waste Product Company's mobile acquisition vehicles entering the hutongs and office dormitories to collect waste products have been widely welcomed by residents, as they provide an outlet for the waste materials that people have accumulated for years. However, according to my understanding, the public has opinions on the acquisition prices. First, the prices are not uniform. For example, a mobile acquisition vehicle in the Qianmen district pays eight fen for a bottle, while another acquisition vehicle pays ten fen for the same bottle. Second, the acquisition of waste products is priced the same regardless of quality. For example, a woman in Suzhou Hutong in the Dongdan district sold three pairs of old leather shoes and received a total of two fen. Such a low price does not arouse the interest of sellers.
    
    I believe that the inconsistent prices may be due to different standards during inspection and acceptance, which will be improved after the acquisition personnel become familiar with the business. However, giving a uniform price regardless of quality is a question worth studying. It is understood that waste product peddlers generally price according to quality. They do this because they can select some usable items from the waste and repair them to make finished products for sale. However, the waste product company destroys all the acquired waste as raw materials for production.
    
    Obviously, destroying the waste without sorting it is wasteful. For example, some broken shoes can be worn again with a little repair, and some iron kettles can be reused by replacing the bottom. Some people say that waste processing costs a lot of manpower, and the result is not worth the loss. I think this statement is not entirely correct, because repairing and processing will create value, and many materials in our country are not excessive, but insufficient.

### 收购废品应该按质论价

    收购废品应该按质论价
    北京市废品公司收购车深入胡同和机关宿舍收购废品，得到了居民的普遍欢迎，因为人们多年堆积的废弃物资有了出路。但是据我了解，群众对收购价格是有意见的。首先是价格不统一，如前门区流动收购车收一个瓶子价八分钱，而另一个收购车对同样的瓶子就给一角钱。其次是收购废品不论质量一个价格，如东单区苏州胡同一位妇女卖出三双旧皮鞋共给二分钱。这样低的价格引不起出售者的兴趣。
    我认为价格不统一，可能是检收时的标准不一，这将会在收购人员熟悉业务以后得到改进；而不论质量统一给一个价，则是一个很值得研究的问题。据了解收购废品的小贩一般都是按质论价，他们所以这样做，是因为从废旧物品中能够挑选一部分尚能利用的物品，加以修补再作成品出售；而废品公司却把收购来的废物一律销毁作为生产原料。
    很显然，把废物不加整理一律销毁，是有浪费的。譬如，有些破鞋稍加修理就可以再穿，有些铁壶换个底也可以再用。有人说，废品加工要花费许多人力，结果是得不偿失。我认为这种说法是不完全正确的，因为整修加工就会创造价值，况且许多物资在我们国家不是过多，而是不足的。　　李曼青
