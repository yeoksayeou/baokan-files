Xinhua News Agency, 31st - Relying on the broad masses of customers to improve service quality. This is the direction of efforts proposed to all service industry employees in Beijing in a letter adopted at the closing of the Beijing Municipal Service Industry Employee Representative Conference today.

The letter proposes establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, further establishing a comrade relationship of mutual respect, mutual care, mutual understanding, and mutual criticism with the broad masses of customers, and relying on the supervision and assistance of customers to improve service work.

In group discussions and plenary speeches, the representatives summarized and examined the achievements and shortcomings of past work, and put forward many opinions on improving the service industry work in the future. Li Futong, a service worker representative from the Jiangquan Bathhouse of the Qianmen District Service Company, put forward eight guarantees on behalf of his unit, guaranteeing that in future work, they will be amiable, proactive, considerate, diligent, and support the old and young, so that customers will come happily and leave satisfied. Xu Chengmin, a conductor from the Beijing Tram Company, and Zhu Wanbao, a conductor from the Beijing Public Bus Company, believed that their service area was very broad and that passengers should be treated like relatives. They proposed being patient, enthusiastic, and modest in their work. Liu Lin, a saleswoman from the Baihuo (Department) Building, believed that in the past, the leadership had not done enough ideological and political education for employees, resulting in some salespersons having a contempt for commerce and not realizing that their job position was a bridge between production and consumption. She suggested strengthening the ideological and political education of service personnel in the future.

In their speeches, the representatives mentioned that there were still some people in society who did not respect the labor of the service industry. They cited examples of customers beating, scolding, and insulting service personnel, and demanded that relevant units strengthen the propaganda and education on respecting the labor of the service industry for these people.

Many representatives stated at the meeting that they would definitely go back and convey the spirit of this meeting on improving service quality and saving every bit, and improve their work with the spirit of the conference.

During the conference, the conference received congratulatory letters from many units. The 330 future barbers, chefs, and service personnel from the Beijing Municipal Urban Service Bureau Employee Training Class expressed in their congratulatory letter to the conference that they are determined to dedicate their youth to this glorious cause together with the predecessors, elder brothers, and elder sisters in the service industry.

Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Youyu and Chen Peng, Deputy Secretaries, Cheng Hongyi and Le Songsheng, Deputy Mayors of Beijing, and the heads of the Municipal Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department and Organization Department all attended the meeting to offer their congratulations.

In his speech at the meeting, Zhang Youyu first extended warm congratulations and high respect on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to the representatives and all people engaged in urban service work. He said that there were more than 100,000 employees in various service industries in Beijing, scattered in more than 10,000 enterprises and institutions, directly serving millions of people in the capital in various different positions.

Zhang Youyu said that the Party and the government have always attached importance to the service industry, and have taken various measures to strengthen the leadership and management of the service industry, strengthen the education of employees, and initially improve the working and living conditions of employees. Zhang Youyu said that the current service quality of the service industry is still not high, the setting of service networks and service points is not reasonable enough, there are still problems in business management and labor technology, and there is serious subjectivism and bureaucracy among leaders at all levels. Only by overcoming these shortcomings can we better serve the people of the capital.

Zhang Youyu said that at present, there are still many people in society who do not respect service personnel. In the future, we must strengthen publicity and education and thoroughly correct the exploitative class ideology and behavior of some people in society.

    依靠广大顾客　提高服务质量
    北京市服务业职工代表会议闭幕
    写信给全市服务业职工提出努力方向
    新华社31日讯　依靠广大顾客，提高服务质量。这是今天闭幕的北京市服务业职工代表会议通过的一封信中，向全市服务业职工提出的努力方向。
    这封信中，提出要树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，进一步和广大顾客建立互相尊重、互相关切、互相体谅、互相批评的同志关系，依靠顾客的监督和协助，把服务工作作得更好。
    代表们在小组讨论和大会发言中，总结和检查了过去的工作成绩和缺点，提出了很多改进今后服务业工作的意见。前门区服务公司江泉浴池服务员李福桐代表本单位提出了八项保证条件，保证在今后工作中做到态度和蔼、主动、周到、勤快、扶老携幼，让顾客高兴而来，满意而去。北京市电车公司售票员徐成敏和北京市公共汽车公司售票员朱万宝认为他们服务的范围很广，对乘客要像对亲人一样。他们提出在工作中要耐心、热心、虚心。百货大楼女售货员刘霖认为，过去领导方面对职工的思想政治教育工作做得不够，以致部分售货员有轻商思想，没有认识到自己的工作岗位是生产和消费的桥梁。她建议今后要加强服务人员的思想政治教育。
    代表们在发言中提到了社会上还有一部分人不尊重服务行业的劳动，他们列举了顾客打骂、侮辱服务人员的事例，要求各有关单位对这些人加强尊重服务业劳动的宣传和教育。
    许多代表们在会上表示，他们一定回去好好地传达这次会议的关于提高服务质量、点滴节约等精神，并以大会的精神来改进工作。
    会议期间，大会收到了许多单位的贺信。北京市城市服务局职工训练班三百三十个未来的理发员、厨师、服务员们，在给会议的祝贺信中表示，他们决心和服务业的前辈们、哥哥姐姐们一起，把自己的青春献给这个光荣的事业。
    中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，副书记张友渔、陈鹏，北京市副市长程宏毅、乐松生和市委财贸部、组织部负责人都到会祝贺。
    张友渔在会上的讲话中，首先代表中共北京市委、北京市人民委员会向代表们和一切从事城市服务工作的人们致热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。他说，北京市各服务行业的职工总计有十万多人，分散在一万多个企业单位中，在各个不同的岗位上，直接为首都的几百万人民服务。
    张友渔说，党和政府一向是重视服务行业的，并采取了各种措施，加强了对服务行业的领导和管理，加强了对职工的教育，初步地改善了职工们的工作条件和生活条件。张友渔说，服务行业目前的服务质量还不高，服务网和服务点的设置不够合理，经营管理和劳动技术还有问题，各级领导存在着严重的主观主义和官僚主义。只有克服这些缺点，才能更好地为首都人民服务。
    张友渔说，目前，社会上还有不少人不尊重服务人员，今后必须加强宣传教育，彻底纠正目前社会上一部分人的剥削阶级的思想行为。
