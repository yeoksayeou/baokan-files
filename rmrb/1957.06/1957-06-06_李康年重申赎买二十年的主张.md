I am Li Kangnian, chairman of the Shanghai joint state-private owned Hongxing Weaving Factory, general manager of China Clock Factory, and manager of Cuizhong Weaving Factory. I am the one who recently proposed the "twenty-year fixed interest" or "twenty-year redemption" as reported in the newspapers.

"Three Proposals"

I have made three proposals.

The first proposal: I advocate that the government issue 2.2 billion yuan in People's Republic of China industrial and commercial enterprise transformation redemption certificates to recover the stocks or partnership agreements owned by capitalists, so that capitalists can disengage from enterprises. The certificates would mature four times a year, with 27.5 million yuan maturing each quarter. Apart from the 220 million yuan already issued in 1956 and 1957, only 1.98 billion yuan would be issued to capitalists. The surplus 220 million yuan would be used as a one-time reward or consolation payment to capitalist representatives, directors, supervisors, and bourgeois elements in need of care. If there is any remaining balance, it should be allocated to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce as a private sector mutual aid fund.

I propose that the Bank of Communications be instructed to handle the above work. Those who do not wish to receive this redemption certificate should be allowed to do as they please. The Bank of Communications may temporarily hold it on their behalf, or donate it, transfer it to others, or pay it to the state treasury according to the wishes of the person entitled to the redemption certificate.

Once the person entitled to the redemption certificate has given it up, it is a manifestation of giving up exploitation. After obtaining a donation receipt or a certificate of payment to the state treasury, the person entitled can use this receipt or certificate as proof of giving up exploitation and strive to join the trade union and obtain labor insurance benefits. After the trade union has reviewed and approved it and issued a trade union membership card, the label of "bourgeois" will be removed. If the above suggestion cannot be adopted, please study the second suggestion.

The second proposal: Please instruct the Bank of Communications to set up a trust department to manage stocks on behalf of the national bourgeoisie, attend shareholders' meetings and board meetings, collect dividends and fixed interest, handle savings and investments, or build houses, or donate, transfer to others, or pay to the state treasury on their behalf. As mentioned above, remove the label of "bourgeois." If the above suggestion still cannot be adopted, please study the third suggestion.

The third proposal: Please instruct the Bank of Communications to increase the service of collecting fixed interest on behalf of others, and also to manage stocks, savings and investments, or build houses, or transfer donations, or pay to the state treasury on their behalf. Remove the label of "bourgeois" as described above.

In addition, the labor employment of capitalists' family members should be properly arranged by the labor department and professional companies. After the issuance of redemption certificates is basically completed, all joint state-private enterprises in the country should be changed to state-owned enterprises. The positions of private sector personnel will then be transformed into public positions. Since the relationship between the public and private sectors has been basically eliminated, at this time, the bourgeois elements will only have some redemption certificates, the nature of which is very similar to national bonds, and the term is longer than national bonds. Most people will have to support themselves, and the distance from the working people will be closer. The class has basically disappeared, the exploitation has basically disappeared, the redemption policy has been basically completed, the transformation of industrial and commercial enterprises has been basically completed, and the capitalist means of production have become completely owned by the whole people.

Since my proposal was put forward, most of what I have received has been unreasonable abuse, and I have not received the help and criticism of truth. After arriving in Beijing this time, I read Comrade Qian Jiaju's speech. He is a central economic theory authority and also our industrial and commercial administrative management leader. He said that Li Kangnian's advocacy of 20-year fixed interest is a manifestation of passivity. In addition to the idea of ​​wanting to eat exploitation for a lifetime, it also includes a misunderstanding of the redemption policy. I have to raise some opinions and discuss with him on this.

My reply is: I don't have the idea of ​​eating exploitation for a lifetime. I am sixty years old this year. Can I definitely live to eighty years old? My children have mostly graduated from university and are doctors, and they don’t need my fixed interest, and my fixed interest is only two or three hundred yuan per month, which I have already used to buy public bonds. My family is not very difficult, so why should I care about these? Comrade Qian Jiaju's assumption that I want to eat exploitation for a lifetime is rather arbitrary.

"My proposal is based on the People's Daily editorial"

As for my suggestion that the term of the redemption certificate be divided into 20 years, the redemption amount should be 2.2 billion yuan, and the words "fixed interest" should be corrected, I have a basis and did not fabricate it. On the eve of the full industry joint operation, on November 22, 1955, the People's Daily published an editorial "Unify Understanding, Make Overall Plans, and Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Transforming Capitalist Industry and Commerce." I believe that this article is the party and the state's policy on the redemption policy, and it is also the party and the state's creed to the industrialists and businessmen to show the redemption policy.

The first paragraph: "Our country will basically complete the transformation of the private ownership of the means of production and build a socialist society in approximately three five-year plan periods." This shows that it will take about fifteen years to build a socialist society.

The first section of the fifth paragraph: "For the Chinese working class, the most appropriate thing is to implement redemption of the means of production of the bourgeoisie, and not to redeem it all at once, but to redeem it gradually over a period of more than ten years." "The dividends distributed to the capitalists are less than a quarter of the profits. The income of the capitalists does not seem to be much, but based on national statistics, it amounts to several hundred million yuan per year. Over a period of more than ten years, it amounts to tens of billions of yuan, which is completely sufficient to use as the price for purchasing all the means of production of the national bourgeoisie." This shows that the state will use tens of billions of yuan to purchase all the means of production of the national bourgeoisie.

The second section of the fifth paragraph: "Redemption is for things, that is, redemption of the means of production of the bourgeoisie. In addition to this, there is also a problem for people, that is, educating and transforming capitalists, appropriately arranging their work, and so on." This shows that redemption is specifically for the means of production, and the education, transformation, and arrangement of capitalists are another matter. This is the peaceful transformation of people.

From this, it can be seen that the party and the government had prepared in advance, that is, it would take fifteen years and tens of billions of yuan to purchase all the means of production of the national bourgeoisie. The party and the government adopted this peaceful transformation policy, which was determined from the beginning of the founding of the country in 1949. This path is peaceful, and if the objective needs require it, it is not impossible to drag a tail. If fifteen years drag on for another tail, isn't it twenty years? Compared with the original planned steps of the party and the government, my proposal is probably not too far away, right? Probably not shooting without a target, right? "Disagree with Qian Jiaju's opinion"

1. Comrade Qian Jiaju said that redemption should not be calculated in detail. Why does he still think that it should be calculated from 1949? What is the use of calculating it?

2. If we want to calculate in detail, 1949 to 1962 is not fourteen years, but less than fourteen years.

3. The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises and the Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises (that is, the four-horse-split method) are all redemptions, which is unfounded.

4. He said that in the past fourteen years (actually only eight years so far), the redemption money recovered by enterprises, some exceeded, some just right, and some less than. These words are completely based on subjective ideals and without any survey data. As far as I know, there are also capitals that have been nominally profitable but actually taxed, resulting in losses (as mentioned in the first section of Comrade Qian Jiaju's speech), there are also capitals that have been lost due to class struggle, and there are also capitals that have been reduced due to the refund of the Five-Anti Campaign. Some are nominally profitable but actually loss-making, some have debts exceeding assets, some have exhausted their capital, and some have even sold their means of livelihood, and some have increased capital due to poor turnover. Aren't these objective existences?

5. He said that industrialists and businessmen should realize that redemption is an arrangement made by the state to transform them, and also to make them feel at ease in the transformation. I feel that he has confused the content of the peaceful transformation policy, because the peaceful transformation policy has two contents. 1. For things (means of production) - redemption (utilization, restriction, transformation) - becomes a socialist production organization. 2. For people (capitalists) - education (life, thought, arrangement) - becomes socialist working people. Although the two are related to each other, they are distinct. He said that redemption is an arrangement for them to be transformed, which seems incomprehensible.

6. Whether it is redemption or purchase, is this a reasonable measure? If it is said to be a reasonable measure, then the capitalists have handed over the means of production, but the government said that it does not owe him a debt that must be repaid. What is this? This is abandoning the meaning of redemption.

7. He said that if redemption is considered that the country owes them a debt, then the seven-year fixed interest is that the country has scraped 65% of the oil and taken advantage. This is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also equivalent to learning in vain for the industrial and commercial circles. This is not destroying capitalism but establishing capitalism. I said that I was really wronged by deducting this hat of establishing capitalism. May I ask how to understand what Chairman Mao said about not half-redemption and half-confiscation.

8. Comrade Qian Jiaju said that redemption should be calculated from 1949. According to Chairman Mao's meeting with the Supreme State Council on the afternoon of January 25, 1956, to discuss the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program 1956-1967 proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he said that in the past six years, the main task of the first three years was to restore the national economy and carry out various social reforms that had not been completed in the previous stage of the revolution, mainly land reform. Since the summer of last year (1955), the socialist transformation, that is, the socialist revolution, has been launched on a very broad scale and with profound depth. In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide. It can be seen that the socialist transformation started since the summer of 1955. Before the summer of 1955, at most it was a preparation period, let alone the beginning of redemption.

9. According to Chairman Mao, the three years after the founding of the country were the period of restoring the national economy, so it can be seen that it was definitely not a redemption period.

10. At the beginning of the founding of the country, it was a period of increasing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both the public and private sectors, and benefiting both labor and capital. The so-called labor and capital are the internal organization of private enterprises, and there was no mention of the redemption policy at that time.

11. The Common Program was established on September 29, 1949, and its third article still protects the economic interests of the bourgeoisie and its private property, and there is no word of redemption.

12. The economic policies of the Common Program are state-owned economy, cooperative economy, individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, private capitalist economy, and state capitalist economy. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, various social economic components divide labor and cooperate and each gets what it deserves. It would be too contradictory to say that the private capitalist economy has already begun to be redeemed.

13. No inventory and verification of assets was carried out in 1949, and the property figures cannot be estimated. If based on the capitalists' account books, they are arbitrarily compiled, each with its own set, and there is no standard, which is not enough to rely on.

14. The revaluation of property was carried out in 1950. At that time, the valuation was only based on the subjective views of the private sector, without the participation of the working class, which was not enough to rely on, and the currency was still the old RMB.

15. Those who advocate that redemption began in 1949, nothing more than want to reduce the amount of redemption and also reduce the amount of fixed interest. But the fact is just the opposite, because at that time, there was inflation and high prices, and the property figures were the highest that year.

16. The Five-Anti Campaign was held in 1952. At that time, the amount of refunds was so large that it was surprising. This kind of refund figure was deducted from the assets, which is good for the state's fixed interest expenditure. It is not good to emphasize that the redemption started before 1952.

17. If the redemption is determined to have started in 1949, what about the new factories and shops that have been opened in the past eight years? What about the labor income of the working class that the government encourages them to start?

18. If the redemption is determined to have started in 1949, why is the length of service currently being discussed emphasized to have started in 1956? "Redemption should be calculated from the date of payment of fixed interest"

Therefore, I advocate that whether it is an old joint venture or a full industry joint venture, the date of payment of fixed interest should be the beginning of redemption, and the property figures should be based on the figures verified during the inventory and verification of assets. What do you think, Comrade Qian Jiaju?

### 李康年重申赎买二十年的主张

专栏：

    李康年重申赎买二十年的主张
    我是上海工商业者公私合营鸿兴织造厂董事长，中国钟表厂总经理，萃众织造厂经理李康年，就是最近报上标题所谓“定息二十年”或者“赎买二十年”的建议者。
    “三个建议”
    我提出了三个建议。
    第一个建议，我主张请政府发行中华人民共和国工商企业改造赎买存单二十二亿元，收回资本家所拥有的股票或合伙议据，使资本家与企业脱离关系。存单每年到期四次，每季到期二千七百五十万元，除1956、1957两年已发二亿二千万元外，对资本家只发十九亿八千万元，多余二亿二千万元，作为对资方代理人、董监事与需要照顾的资产阶级分子，给予一次酬劳或慰籍金，如再有余额，即拨交全国工商联，作为私方生活互助基金。
    前项工作，拟请指令交通银行办理，有不愿得此项赎买存单者，得听其自便，交通银行得代为暂时保存，或按赎买存单应得人之意旨，代为捐献，或转赠他人，或缴纳国库。
    赎买存单应得人既已放弃赎买存单，即是放弃剥削之表现，应得人于取得捐献收据，或缴纳国库之凭证后，即可将此收据或凭证，作为放弃剥削之凭证，而向工会争取入会，争取劳保待遇，经工会审查核准，给与工会会员证后，资产阶级帽子，即已摘去了。如上述建议不能采取，则请研究第二个建议。
    第二个建议，请政府指令交通银行，增辟信托部，代民族资产阶级保管股票，出席股东会，董事会，代收股息红利定息，代办储蓄投资或建造房屋，或代为捐献，转赠他人，或缴纳国库，按如上所述，摘去资产阶级帽子。上述建议如再不能采用，则请研究第三个建议。
    第三个建议请政府指令交通银行增加代领定息业务，同时亦得代管股票，及储蓄投资，或建造房屋，或代为转赠捐献，或缴纳国库。按以上所述摘去资产阶级的帽子。
    此外如资方家属的劳动就业，应责成劳动部门及专业公司妥为安排，在赎买存单发行基本上完成后，国内公私合营企业一律改为国营，私方人员职务，即蜕变而为公家职位，公私关系既已基本消灭，此时资产阶级分子手中，只多了一些赎买存单，其性质与国家公债大同小异，期限且较公债为长，大多数人已经必须自食其力了，与劳动人民距离更近了，阶级基本消灭了，剥削基本消灭了，赎买政策基本完成了，工商业企业改造基本完成了，资本主义生产资料，已完全成为全民所有了。
    自从我的建议书提出后，所受到的，多半是无理的谩骂，而得不到真理的帮助与批评。这一次到京以后，读了千家驹同志的发言，他是中央经济理论权威，也是我们工商界行政管理领导，他谈到了李康年主张定息二十年就是消极性的表现，定息二十年除了想吃剥削饭一辈子的思想以外，同时还包括一个对赎买政策认识错误的问题。对这，我不得不提出一些意见与他商榷。
    我的答复是：我没有想吃剥削饭一辈子的思想。我今年六十岁了，难道我一定能活到八十岁么，孩子们多已大学毕业做医生了，他们也不会要的，况且我的定息每月不过二三百元，目前都已买公债了，我的家境也不很困难，何必要计较这些呢，千家驹同志认为我想一辈子吃剥削饭未免武断。
   “我建议的根据是人民日报的社论”
    至于我建议赎买存单年期分二十年，赎买金额应为人民币二十二亿元，定息两字应该更正，我是有根据而不是捏造的。当全行业合营前夕，1955年11月22日，人民日报发表了一篇“统一认识，全面规划，认真地做好改造资本主义工商业的工作”的社论。这篇文章，我认为是党和国家对赎买政策的方针，亦是党和国家对工商业者昭示了赎买政策的信条。
    第一段“我国在大约三个五年计划的时期内，基本上完成生产资料私人所有制的变革，而建成社会主义社会”。这说明大约需要十五年之期建成社会主义社会。
    第五段第一节“对于我国工人阶级说来，最适当的正是向资产阶级的生产资料实行赎买，并且不是一下子赎买，而是在十几年的时间里，逐步赎买。”“分给资本家的不足四分之一的股息红利，资本家所得，看来不算很多，但是就全国统计，一年就有几亿人民币，积十几年之久，就有人民币几十亿之多，用来作为购买民族资产阶级的全部生产资料的代价，是完全足够的了”，这说明国家将以几十亿人民币，来购买民族资产阶级的全部生产资料。
    第五段第二节“赎买是对物的，即赎买资产阶级的生产资料。除这以外，还有一个对人的问题，即对资本家进行教育改造，适当地安排他们的工作等等的问题”。这说明赎买是专对生产资料的，至于对资本家教育改造安排乃是另一回事。这是对人的和平改造。
    从此可以见得党和政府，在事先是预有准备，即是需要十五年之期，用几十亿人民币，来购买民族资产阶级的全部生产资料的。党和政府采取这个和平改造的方针，是从1949年立国之初就确定了的，这个道路是和平的，倘然客观需要，再拖一个尾巴，也是未尝不可的。如果十五年再拖一个尾巴，岂不是二十年吗？我的建议与党和政府原定计划步骤相对照，恐怕不是相距太远吧，恐怕不是无的放矢吧？“不同意千家驹的意见”
    一、千家驹同志说，赎买不要算细账，何以他还认为应从1949年算起呢，算了有什么作用呢？
    二、倘然要算细账，1949年到1962年并不是十四年而是十四年不足。
    三、私营企业暂行条例和公私合营工业企业暂行条例（即四马分肥办法）都是赎买，此说没有根据。
    四、他说十四年中（实际上到目前只有八年）企业收回的赎金，有的超过，有的刚好，有的不到，不外这三种情况，这些话完全是凭主观的理想而毫无调查资料。就我所知，还有资本被虚盈实税因而亏本的，（千家驹同志发言第一节中所说的）还有资本被阶级斗争因而损失的，还有资本被五反退款因而短少的，有的虚盈实亏，有的资负倒挂，有的资本蚀光，有的生活资料亦已卖光，也有因周转不灵而增资的，这些岂不是客观的存在吗。
    五、他说工商业者应该认识赎买是国家对他们进行改造的一种安排，也在于使他们安心改造，我觉得他把和平改造方针的内容混淆起来了，因为和平改造方针有二个内容。一，对物（生产资料）——赎买（利用、限制、改造）——成为社会主义生产机构。二，对人（资本家）——教育（生活、思想、安排）——成为社会主义劳动人民。两者之间虽互相关连，而各有区别，他说赎买是对他们进行改造的一种安排，似觉不可理解。
    六、无论赎买也好，购买也好，这是不是一种合理措施呢，如果说是合理措施，则资本家既将生产资料交出而政府说并不是欠他之债非还不可，这成什么话呢。这是丢却赎买意义了。
    七、他说赎买如认为国家欠了他们债则定息七年是国家揩了65％的油，占了便宜，这不仅不符事实，而且对工商界说来也等于白白学习，这不是破资本主义而是立资本主义。我说，我扣了这顶立资本主义的帽子实在有些冤枉，请问毛主席所谓不是半赎买半没收之说，作如何理解。
    八、千家驹同志说赎买应自1949年算起，兹查毛主席于1956年1月25日下午召集最高国务会议讨论中共中央提出的1956—1967年全国农业发展纳要草案时说在过去的六年中，前三年的工作主要是恢复国民经济和进行前一革命阶段中没有完成的各项社会改革，主要是土地改革。从去年（1955年）夏季以来社会主义改造也就是社会主义革命，就以极广阔的规模和深刻的程度，展开起来，大约再有三年的时间，社会主义的革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。可见得社会主义改造是1955年夏季以来开始的，1955年夏季以前，至多说是准备时期，更说不到是赎买开始时期。
    九、根据毛主席说开国以后的三年中，是恢复国民经济时期，可见得决不是赎买时期。
    十、开国之初，是增加生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利时期，所谓劳资，即是私营企业内部组织，当时还谈不到赎买政策。
    十一、共同纲领订立于1949年9月29日，其第三条还是保护资产阶级的经济利益，及其私有财产，还没有赎买字样。
    十二、共同纲领的经济政策，是国营经济，合作社经济，农民和手工业者个体经济，私人资本主义经济，国家资本主义经济等，各种社会经济成份，在国营经济领导下，分工合作，各得其所，如果说私人资本主义经济已在开始赎买之中，未免太矛盾了。
    十三、1949年并未进行清产核资，财产数字无法估计，如照资本家账册记载，他们是随意编造，各自一套，绝无标准，殊不足凭。
    十四、财产重估是1950年进行的，当时估价是仅凭私方主观进行的，并无工人阶级参加，不足为凭，且币制还是旧人民币。
    十五、主张赎买开始是1949年者，无非欲减少赎买金额，兼可减少定息数字，但事实恰恰与此相反，因为当时通货膨胀，物价高涨，财产数字是最高的一年。
    十六、五反是1952年举行的，当时退款数字之大，殊足惊人，这种退款数字，都是在资产项下减除的，这对国家定息之支出，是有好处的，如果强调赎买开始在1952年以前，是没有好处的。
    十七、如果赎买确定为1949年开始，则八年以来所开新厂新店怎么办呢？其问题有工人阶级劳动所得而由政府鼓励他们创办的，又将怎么办呢？
    十八、如果赎买确定为1949年开始，则目前正在讨论的工龄问题，何以强调应为1956年开始呢？“赎买应从定息起付之日算起”
    所以我主张无论老合营或全行业合营，一律以定息起付之日为赎买开始之时，财产数字一律以清产核资时所核定的数字为准，质之千家驹同志以为何如。
