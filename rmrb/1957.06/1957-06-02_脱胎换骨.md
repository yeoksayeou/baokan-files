    “Complete Transformation”
    Keyue

    The Chinese language is very beautiful, especially with so many idioms that can truly be described as rich and colorful. A single idiom, with just a few words, can represent a profound meaning, even surpassing a series of modern terms in its description. Sometimes it can only be understood intuitively and not expressed verbally. If someone lacks a basic understanding of Chinese literature and interprets words literally, they will inevitably make many laughable mistakes and become a laughingstock. I remember my childhood when I heard elders say that the emperor's words were "golden words and jade sayings," which made my young and innocent mind conjure up fantasies, imagining that the emperor truly had a naturally golden mouth and jade tongue, while only the mouths and teeth of us common people were made of flesh and blood. When I heard stories scolding someone for having an iron heart, I imagined that person's heart was truly as hard as iron.

    Unexpectedly, similar jokes actually appear today, and they come from the mouths of some senior intellectuals. They are dissatisfied with the use of "complete transformation" to describe the ideological changes of the Chinese bourgeoisie as they accept socialist transformation. However, most people, including the bourgeoisie themselves, believe that this idiom is the most appropriate description, very profound, and explains the qualitative transformation after a difficult process and pain. Because transforming a bourgeois element from an exploiter into a genuine laborer is not easy. It requires a profound internal self-struggle by the bourgeois element to be effective. If interpreted literally, it can only be said that in terms of ideology, they shed the "womb" of the exploiting class and replace it with the "bones" of the laborers. Since it is already known that the idiom "complete transformation" is used by Taoists to describe the state of "cultivation" where their "spiritual practice" has reached the point of "shedding the mortal body and replacing it with immortal bones," then, if one must make an association, I agree with someone's suggestion that it should be associated with another idiom related to Taoism, "transcending the mortal and entering the saintly," rather than associating it with the irrelevant "drawing out the tendons and peeling the skin."

    I do not understand why they make such associations. What is the intention of interpreting "complete transformation" as "drawing out the tendons and peeling the skin"? Did they foresee that this would arouse resentment among industrialists and businessmen towards socialist transformation? As for the issue of imperialists and reactionaries using this to spread rumors, these gentlemen can rest assured that there is no need to fear these. Imperialists will always come up with new tricks to curse us. Let their rumors and curses, following similar rumors that once circulated overseas and in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, such as the "smell-scent teams" and "naked parades," be punctured by the facts and disappear on their own!

    I believe that for the bourgeois elements who are happy to accept socialist transformation, the idiom "complete transformation," based on their personal experience, will only lead them to deeply recognize that ideological transformation is a difficult process. After they hand over their enterprises, their thinking will indeed undergo great changes, but a completely opposite "sudden change" cannot occur immediately without any inheritance. With their existing cultural literacy, it is even less likely to cause the misunderstanding of "drawing out the tendons and peeling the skin." Even if misunderstandings exist, they will dissipate and be resolved calmly after the reasoning is explained clearly. However, some people use the excuse of refusing to use the phrase "complete transformation" to insist that ideological transformation is an easy task, and even believe that the bourgeois elements have nothing left to transform. These people are either un-transformed and do not understand the difficulty of transformation, or they are arguing sophistically and using this as a shield. For these people, this explanation may be superfluous; what else can I say?

    “脱胎换骨”
    克约
    我国的语文是很优美的，特别是有许多成语真可以说得上是丰富而多采。一句成语寥寥几个字，可是它所代表的意义却深湛极了，甚至用一连串的现代词汇来描写，还不如它一语破的。有时甚至只可以意会，而不可以言传。如果有人对于我国文学缺乏素养，望文生义，那就难免弄得笑话百出，而贻笑大方了。我想到我的童稚年代，听到老人说从前皇帝是“金口玉言”，就使我童年幼稚的脑海里浮起幻想，想像皇帝真是有一个天生成的金口和玉舌似的，只有我们老百姓的口和牙才是骨肉做的。听到说故事时骂某人是铁石心肠，就幻想这个人的心肠真是坚如铁石一样。
    想不到类似的笑话，居然出现在今天，而且是出自某一些高级知识分子之口。他们不满意有人用“脱胎换骨”来形容中国资产阶级分子的接受社会主义改造的思想变化；但是，一般人，包括资产阶级分子在内，都认为这一形容词是说明得再恰当也没有了，是非常深湛的，是说明了经过了艰巨的过程和阵痛而后起了质的转换的。因为，把资产阶级分子由一个剥削者改造成为名副其实的劳动者，不是轻而易举的，是要经过资产阶级分子深刻的内心的自我斗争才能奏效的。如果望文生义，也只能说在思想方面脱去剥削阶级的“胎”，换成劳动者的“骨”；既然已经知道“脱胎换骨”这一成语是道家说明他们“修炼”的“道行”功夫已到“脱凡胎换仙骨”的境地，那末，如果一定要联想的话，我也同意有人说的，那就应联想到同道家有关的另一成语“超凡入圣”，而不致联想到同这毫不相干的“抽筋剥皮”。
    我不明了他们为什么要作如此的联想。把“脱胎换骨”解释成为“抽筋剥皮”的用意何在？他们是否早已预料到这是会挑起工商界人士对社会主义改造的反感？至于帝国主义者和反动分子会借此造谣的问题，那也可以请这些先生们放心，是不必害怕这些的；帝国主义者总要想出些新花样来咒骂我们的。让他们的造谣和咒骂，追随着过去曾经流行在海外和国民党统治区的如“闻香队”、“裸体游行”等类似谣言之后，被事实来戳穿而自行烟消云散吧！
    我相信，“脱胎换骨”这一成语，对一般乐于接受社会主义改造的资产阶级分子来说，以他们的亲身体会，是只会从其中深刻地认识到思想改造是一个艰巨的过程，在他们把企业交出以后，思想上固然会有很大的变化，但不能立即无继承性地产生完全相反的“突变”；以他们现有的文化素养，更是不会引起“抽筋剥皮”这一误会的；即或存在误会，经过讲清道理，也就冰释了，泰然了。但是，某些人却以拒用“脱胎换骨”这一句话作借口，硬说思想改造是轻而易举的事，甚至认为资产阶级分子现在已没有什么可以改造的。这些人，要么就是未经改造，不了解改造的艰巨性；要么就是强词夺理，把这作为挡箭牌。对于这些人，这个解释或许是多余的；我还能有什么可说的呢？
