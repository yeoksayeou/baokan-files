Xinhua News Agency, June 4th Dispatch from Singapore: Businessmen in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya welcome the British relaxation of trade restrictions with China.

    The chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Arjoon Moorjani, said that Britain's courageous move to relax trade with China despite the opposition of the United States, I believe that Singapore's trade with China will be freer in the future.

    The secretary of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce of Malaya, Mr. Huang Jinhuo, said that the British decision was reasonable. Although this relaxation does not immediately benefit Malaya, it indirectly helps trade between China and Malaya in the long run.

    The president of the Pan-Malayan Indian Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Ubaidulla, said that the relaxation of trade restrictions with China should have been implemented long ago. China can exchange inexpensive and good-quality goods for rubber from Malaya.

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th Dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Kusumowidagdo, said on the evening of June 3rd that the time has come to restore normal trade relations with China. He said that the Indonesian Foreign Ministry is closely monitoring the situation after Britain relaxed its embargo on China.

    Mr. Kusumowidagdo pointed out that many Asian countries, including Indonesia, have long suffered from the consequences of the embargo. In order to develop their national economies, these Asian countries need to establish normal trade relations with China, which has a population of 600 million.

    He believes that it would be better if Britain took this action together with other countries through the United Nations. In this way, the embargo would be formally and completely lifted.

    欢迎英国放宽禁运
    印度尼西亚密切注意情势的发展
    据新华社4日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡和马来亚联合邦的商人欢迎英国放宽对中国贸易的限制。
    新加坡印度人的商会主席亚逊摩说，英国不顾美国的反对，自行放宽对中国的贸易，可以说是一个勇敢的举动，我相信今后新加坡对中国的贸易必能较为自由。
    马来亚联合邦马华商联会秘书黄锦和说，英国这次决定是合理的，这项放宽虽然没有使马来亚立即受惠，但是，从长远来看，这是间接有助于中国和马来亚贸易的。
    全马印度人商联会会长乌拜都拉说，放宽对中国的贸易限制早就应该施行，中国是可以用价廉物美的货品和马来亚交换橡胶的。
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人库索莫维达格多6月3日晚上发表谈话说，恢复对中国的正常贸易关系的时候本来已经到了。他说，印度尼西亚外交部正在密切注意英国放宽对中国禁运以后的情势。
    库索莫维达格多指出，包括印度尼西亚在内的许多亚洲国家久已身受禁运的恶果。这些亚洲国家为了发展国民经济，需要同拥有六亿人口的中国建立正常的贸易关系。
    他认为，如果英国通过联合国和其他国家一起采取这个行动会更好些。这样，禁运就将正式完全撤销。
