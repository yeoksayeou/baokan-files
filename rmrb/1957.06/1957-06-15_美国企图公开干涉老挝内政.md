The United States Attempts to Openly Interfere in Laotian Internal Affairs
By a commentator of this newspaper

    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson is baring his fangs again. This time he wants to scare the Laotian people and attempt to openly interfere in Laotian internal affairs.

    After the resignation of Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma of the Kingdom of Laos, patriotic figures from all sides in Laos are striving to ensure that the talks between Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong, which have already achieved good results, continue to achieve greater success, in order to realize the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government. Prince Souvanna Phouma's speech in the Lao National Assembly and the National Assembly's discussion of this issue show that the establishment of a coalition government is the unanimous demand and desire of the entire country of Laos.

    In order to thwart this desire of the Lao people to unify the country and maintain peace and neutrality, the United States has done everything possible to carry out sabotage activities. Now, before the formation of the new Laotian cabinet, Robertson has openly come out against the establishment of a coalition government in Laos. In order to conceal this despicable act of interfering in Laotian internal affairs, he described the unanimous desire of the Lao people as a "Communist subversion." Even more ridiculous is that Robertson actually described this "Communist subversion" as being "prompted" by China. We can tell Robertson here that the Chinese people do not have the hobby and habit of interfering in other people's internal affairs like the American aggressors. The Chinese people have always abided by, and will continue to abide by, the sacred obligation of non-interference in Laotian internal affairs imposed on the participating countries by the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. It was the United States that was unwilling to assume this obligation at that time, and it is still the United States that is interfering in Laotian internal affairs in various ways now. Not to mention the distant past, just take Robertson's clamoring on June 12 as an example. He said, "In order to deal with this situation (that is, to deal with the desire of the Lao people to generally establish a coalition government), the United States is helping the Lao government maintain its 25,000 troops and improve the efficiency of its domestic security forces."

    The patriotic people of Laos will be vigilant about this. When Prince Souvanna Phouma issued an order to the Lao armed forces on June 13, he said that if a civil war were to occur, it "could be fatal for the entire country of Laos." He also said, "Soldiers know better than anyone else that people must want the benefits of peace rather than the destruction and suffering of war." This is a meaningful sentence that represents the voice of the Lao people. We believe that the Lao people are capable of finding their own path and are capable of discerning what kind of policy is in line with their national interests.

　　美国企图公开干涉老挝内政
　　本报评论员
    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊又在咧嘴呲牙了，这一次他想吓唬老挝人民，企图公开干涉老挝内政。
    老挝王国政府首相富马亲王辞职后，老挝各方爱国人士正在努力使富马亲王同苏发努冯亲王所已经取得良好成就的双方会谈继续取得更大成就，以便实现关于成立联合政府的协议。富马亲王在老挝国民议会的发言、国民议会对这一问题的讨论都显示了成立联合政府乃是老挝举国一致的要求和愿望。
    为了打击老挝人民统一国家和和平中立的这种愿望，美国曾千方百计地进行了破坏活动，现在罗伯逊在老挝新内阁组成之前，竟公开站出来反对老挝成立联合政府。为了掩饰这一干涉老挝内政的卑劣行动，他把老挝人民一致的愿望说成是“共产党颠复”。更加可笑的是罗伯逊竟将这种“共产党颠复”说成是中国“提示”的。可以在这里告诉罗伯逊，中国人民不像美国侵略者那样有干涉人家内政的爱好和习惯。中国人民一直信守着，将来也将信守日内瓦会议最后宣言所加予与会各国不干涉老挝内政的神圣义务。当时不愿承担这一义务的是美国，现在以各种方式干涉老挝内政的还是美国。远的姑且不说，就拿罗伯逊的这一次6月12日的叫嚣为例，他说，“为了对付这种情况（按即对付老挝人民普遍要求成立联合政府的愿望），美国正在帮助老挝政府维持它的二万五千名军队和提高它的国内治安队效率。”
    老挝的爱国人士会警惕到这一点。富马亲王在6月13日向老挝武装部队发布命令时说，如果发生内战，“对于老挝全国说来可能是致命的”。他又说，“军人比谁都更清楚地知道，人们必定是愿意要和平的好处而不要战争的破坏和苦难。”这是一句意味深长的话，它代表着老挝人民的声音。我们相信，老挝人民是能够找出他们自己的道路的，并且是能够辨别什么样的政策是符合于他们的国家利益的。
