Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly convened an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee tonight to criticize Zhang Naiqi's recently published absurd remarks.

　　This enlarged meeting adopted the "Joint Statement by the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on Supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's Report and Continuing to Strengthen the Struggle Against the Reactionary Activities of Rightists such as Zhang Naiqi."

　　At the beginning of the meeting, Wang Xinyuan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Vice Minister of Light Industry, introduced to everyone the absurd remarks made by Zhang Naiqi during the discussion of Premier Zhou Enlai's Report on the Work of the Government. Zhang Naiqi disagreed with Premier Zhou's criticism of him in the report. Zhang Naiqi defended himself. He said he was a "revolutionary optimist" and had "never been pessimistic." He said that he opposed capitalism before liberation. He said that he was not a hypocrite, let alone a double-dealer. He "has always diligently dedicated his entire life to the Party (referring to the Chinese Communist Party) and all his energy to socialism." He said, "Even if I die and my bones are burned to ashes, you won't find anything anti-socialist in the ashes."

　　Zhang Naiqi said that all his words and deeds were "to mobilize the enthusiasm of the bourgeoisie" and "to persuade the bourgeoisie to sincerely take the socialist road." Zhang Naiqi attacked the Communist Party for "not following Lenin's principles" in transforming the bourgeoisie. He believed that "the distance between people has become greater after the elimination of classes," that "industrialists and businessmen have not fully raised their heads, and it is difficult to give full play to their enthusiasm," and that "it was too hasty to propose a thorough transformation after public-private partnerships." He said that his statement that "bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism" meant emphasizing the importance of opposing bureaucracy.

　　Zhang Naiqi said that his words and actions had not deviated from Chairman Mao's six criteria for distinguishing right from wrong. He said that he had no revisionism, and his words, life, and actions had never deviated from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. He requested the State Council to conduct a thorough examination of him, the more thorough the better.

　　Zhang Naiqi said that he had a sense of propriety when making suggestions, which was to take care of the prestige of the CCP Central Committee. He said that he "cherishes the Party as much as he cherishes his own eyes." He said that although he was inferior to Party members, he was no worse than state cadres. He said that he had "utmost respect" for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and his remarks did not criticize the CCP Central Committee in the slightest. What he criticized were certain people and certain organizations of the CCP.

　　Zhang Naiqi did not admit that his anti-socialist remarks were harmful. He said that if any harm had occurred, he was willing to "bravely accept criticism." He said that he "absolutely had no intention of finding a market or applause in the industrial and commercial circles." He also said that he was not a politician, nor was he worthy of being a political schemer, and there was no "insincerity." He said that if he were asked to "make an insincere self-criticism, he would not have the strength."

　　In his speech, Zhang Naiqi also attacked Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CCP Central Committee, for "listening to only one side" and "quoting out of context."

　　As Wang Xinyuan introduced Zhang Naiqi's remarks that were disguising himself and beautifying himself, the meeting hall resounded with bursts of ridicule.

　　Then, Wang Xinyuan criticized Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks. He said that Zhang Naiqi was a thorough and complete bourgeois rightist element with theory, program, and organization, and he must be resolutely fought so that the vast number of industrialists and businessmen would not be deceived by him.

　　Fourteen other people, including Rong Yiren, also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they pointed out that after reading Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Zhang Naiqi continued to spread absurd remarks, which was intolerable and meant he was cutting himself off from the people. They expressed that they would draw a clear line between themselves and Zhang Naiqi and fight him to the end. They said that Zhang Naiqi must make a thorough confession. Rong Yiren believed that people in industrial and commercial circles should learn from this anti-rightist struggle and strengthen self-reform.

　　Zhang Naiqi did not attend today's meeting.

　　民建和工商联常委会联席会议揭露：
　　章乃器坚持错误拒绝检讨
    荣毅仁认为工商界应吸取教训加强自我改造
    据新华社27日讯  中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会在今天晚上联合举行中央常务委员扩大会议，批判章乃器最近发表的荒谬言论。
    这次扩大会议通过了“中国民主建国会、中华全国工商业联合会关于拥护周恩来总理的报告，继续加强对章乃器等右派分子的反动活动进行斗争的联合声明”。
    在会议开始的时候，民建中央常委、轻工业部副部长王新元向大家介绍了章乃器在讨论周恩来总理关于政府工作报告时所发表的荒谬言论。章乃器不同意周总理在报告中对他的批评。章乃器为他自己辩护。他说他是“革命的乐观主义者”，“从来没有悲观过”。他说，他在解放前就反对资本主义。他说，他不是口是心非的人，更不是两面派。他“始终是勤勤恳恳地把自己整个生命交给党（指中国共产党），全部精力献给社会主义”。他说，他“死了以后，就是把骨头烧成灰，在骨灰里也找不出反社会主义的东西来”。
    章乃器说，他的一切言论和行动都是“为了调动资产阶级的积极性”，“说服资产阶级诚心诚意地走社会主义道路”。章乃器攻击共产党“没有按照列宁的原则”来对资产阶级进行改造。他认为“阶级消灭以后人与人之间的距离搞得大了”，“工商业者没有完全抬起头来，发挥积极性有困难”，“在公私合营以后提脱胎换骨是过急了”。他说，他的关于“官僚主义比资本主义更危险”的说法，意思是强调反对官僚主义的重要性。
    章乃器说，他的言论行动没有离开毛主席明辨是非的六条标准，他说他没有修正主义，他的言论、生活和行动没有离开过马列主义的基本原则。他要求国务院对他进行检查，检查越彻底越好。
    章乃器说，他提意见有个分寸，就是照顾中共中央的威信，他说他“爱护党就像爱护自己的眼珠一样”。他说，他虽然比党员差，但同国家干部比并不差。他说，他对中国共产党领导是“万分尊重的”，他的言论没有一点批评过中共中央，他批评的是中共的某些人和某些组织。
    章乃器不承认他的反社会主义言论有危害性，他说如果发生了危害，他愿“勇敢地接受批评”。他说他“绝对没有意图在工商界找市场、找鼓掌”。他还说他不是一个政治家，也不配作一个政客，没有“言不由衷”。他说，如果要他“作言不由衷的检讨，他没有气力”。
    章乃器在发言中，还攻击中共中央统战部部长李维汉“偏听偏信”、“断章取义”。
    在王新元介绍章乃器这些伪装自己、把自己美化的言论时，会场响起了一阵阵的讥笑声。
    接着，王新元对章乃器这些反动言论进行了批判。他说，章乃器是彻头彻尾的有理论、有纲领、有组织的资产阶级右派分子，对他必须坚决地进行斗争，使广大工商业者不致上他的当。
    在会上发言的还有荣毅仁等十四人。他们在发言中指出，章乃器在看了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告和周总理的政府工作报告以后，仍然散布荒谬的言论，这是令人不能容忍的，是他自绝于人民。他们表示要和章乃器划清界限，跟他斗争到底。他们说，章乃器必须彻底交代。荣毅仁认为，工商界人士应该通过这次反右派的斗争吸取教训，加强自我改造。
    章乃器没有参加今天的会议。
