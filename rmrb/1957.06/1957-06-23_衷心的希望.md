　　In the autumn of 1955, the Japanese Kabuki troupe traveled across the sea to perform in China, where they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people. In the summer of 1956, the Chinese Peking Opera troupe also traveled across the sea to perform in Japan, where they were also warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

　　Such a grand event took place between the two countries that had not yet restored diplomatic relations, which clearly shows what the people of Japan and China are seeking.

　　As the leader of the Kabuki troupe, I gained unforgettable inspiration in China. I am filled with respect and affection for Mr. Mei Lanfang, the most outstanding actor in the Peking Opera world, for his art and his person. I feel that friendship transcending the national conditions and thoughts of the two countries has developed very naturally through art.

　　I believe that in the relationship between Japan and China, despite many subtleties, the future will be like water flowing downwards, and it will definitely move in the direction it should.

　　My work is to perform on stage. When that moment appears between actors and the audience, when hearts connect with hearts beyond national borders, I feel that this is true peace. After the curtain falls, I always feel relieved and greatly joyful at the same time.

　　The year before last, when performing in Beijing, the stage and the audience were so integrated that I completely forgot "this is in China." This is precisely the expression of the inseparable and unbreakable friendship between Japan and China for thousands of years. I sincerely hope that the diplomatic relations between the two countries can adapt to the close and seamless feelings of the people of the two countries and normalize as soon as possible.

### 衷心的希望

　　衷心的希望
　　日本艺术院会员
    1955年秋，日本的歌舞伎剧团曾渡海去中国公演，在各地都受到了广大中国人民的热烈欢迎。1956年夏，中国的京剧团也渡海来日本公演，在各地也受到了广大日本人民的热烈欢迎。
    在尚未恢复邦交的两国间已有这样盛举，这明显地表示出日中两国人民在寻求什么。
    我，作为歌舞伎剧团团长，在中国得到了终生难忘的铭感。对于京剧界最杰出的演员梅兰芳先生，对于他的艺术和为人，我满怀着尊敬和亲切之感。我感到超越了两国国情和思想的友谊，通过艺术得到了很自然的发展。
    我相信日中两国关系上，尽管有许多微妙之处，但将来将如水之就下，一定会向应进的方向前进的。
    我的工作是在舞台上演出，当演员和群众之间出现超越了国境的心灵同心灵的交融那一瞬间，我感到，这才是真正的和平。我在闭幕之后，总是在感到安堵的同时，又感到很大喜悦。
    前年，在北京公演的时候，舞台和观众融然一体竟达到了这样程度，以致使我完全忘记了“这是在中国”。这正是日本和中国几千年来分不开、斩不断的友谊的表现。我衷心希望，两国的邦交，能够适应两国人民的这种亲密无间的感情，尽快地正常化起来。
