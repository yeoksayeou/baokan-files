	The great outbreak of the anti-American movement by the Taiwanese people caused by the Reynolds case, it is said, has caused anxiety among American officials, who are worried that this incident may have repercussions in Japan. This worry is not without reason. And in fact, repercussions have already occurred and are expanding. According to reports, Japan is about to launch a mass movement demanding that the U.S. military hand over Jerard, the murderer who shot and killed a Japanese woman in Somagahara, to Japan for trial. This is one of the specific repercussions.

	The Somagahara incident occurred on January 30 of this year. The matter dragged on for several months, and it was not until May 16 of this year that the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee decided to hand over the Jerard case to the Japanese court for trial. However, the next day, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson ordered the U.S. military authorities in the Far East not to hand Jerard over to the Japanese government until a thorough study of the case had been conducted. Although the Maebashi District Court accepted the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office's indictment of Jerard, the trial of the case has not actually proceeded because the U.S. military refused to hand over the criminal. The Japanese people are extremely indignant about this. The "Japan Times," in commenting on the anti-American incidents by the Taiwanese people, said that if Japanese courts do not have jurisdiction over American soldiers, the intense anti-American demonstrations that occurred in Taipei may be a manifestation of events happening in Japan, which is not an excessive exaggeration.

	The dispute over jurisdiction in the Somagahara incident is ostensibly due to differing views between Japan and the United States as to whether the incident occurred during the performance of official duties. According to the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, which greatly undermines Japanese sovereignty, the Japanese side only has jurisdiction over criminal cases involving U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan if they occur outside the performance of official duties. However, there have been precedents for the so-called "performance of official duties" by U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan: when U.S. soldiers broke into a private residence during a patrol and raped a woman, the U.S. military side also claimed that this should be regarded as "performance of official duties." One can imagine how broad the scope is. According to investigations, the Somagahara incident occurred during the U.S. military's rest time. Jerard deliberately enticed people to pick up bullet casings, then dispersed them and shot and killed a woman. However, the U.S. military stationed in Japan believes that this was "performance of official duties." One member of the U.S. House of Representatives even said that Jerard was protecting American property on American territory, and it would be "outrageous" to have him stand before a Japanese court. This is truly a bizarre argument. It is unbelievable to say that this American congressman does not understand geography. This only reveals a secret: in the eyes of American occupiers and colonialists, Japan is simply not a country, let alone have sovereignty or jurisdiction. The U.S. insistence on the so-called "performance of official duties" in the Jerard case is actually just a guise to conceal this view.

	The "New York Times" also has another argument, arguing that the Japanese side should not have jurisdiction over "friendly American troops stationed in Japan for the purpose of defending the Japanese." This argument is hardly worth refuting seriously, because the Japanese people have long experienced and clearly recognized how the U.S. military "defends the Japanese."

	Just as the Reynolds incident was merely a fuse that ignited the pent-up resentment of the Taiwanese people, the emotions displayed by the Japanese people in the Jerard case are merely an expression of accumulated grievances. He who plants peonies gets flowers, he who sows thistles reaps thorns. Dulles also admitted that the root cause of this long-standing resentment lies in the occupation by the American military. He said at a press conference on May 29: "A large number of troops stationed in foreign territories will cause 'inevitable tensions'," "'this is a very delicate and explosive issue'," "we must find better ways to deal with it than we have already found."

	Regarding the Jerard case, Dulles said: American representatives made a decision in March of this year to "waive jurisdiction" in this case. Not to mention that this decision made by the American representatives has been trampled underfoot by U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, the statement that the United States "waived" jurisdiction over the Jerard case also contains a great deal of deception. Since it is said to be "waived", then that means the "power" originally belonged to the United States. The United States "waived" the "power" that originally belonged to it, and the Japanese should be grateful and content. But who gave the United States this "power"? Isn't it self-proclaimed by the United States? The fundamental problem is that the United States should not have troops stationed in other people's countries, should not occupy bases, and should not have "powers" such as extraterritoriality. The best way to solve the "explosive issue" mentioned by Dulles is to withdraw troops and abolish military bases in foreign territories, but the United States cannot and does not want to do so. The inevitable tragedy of imperialism lies here. It knows full well that it is sitting on a powder keg, but it treats the powder keg as an armchair and does not want to leave once it sits on it. Then what better solution is there? Then let it ascend to heaven in the explosion!

    种蒺藜者得刺
    刘仲平
    由雷诺案引起的台湾人民反美运动的大爆发，据说，在美国官方人士中引起了一种焦虑，他们担心这次事件可能在日本产生反响。这种担心是不无理由的。而且事实上反响已经产生，并且愈来愈扩大了。报载：日本即将展开群众运动，要求美军把在相马原枪杀日本妇女的凶手哲腊德交给日本审判，这就是具体的反响之一。
    相马原事件是在今年1月30日发生的。事情拖了几个月，到今年5月16日，日美联合委员会才决定把哲腊德案件交由日本法院审理。但第二天，美国国防部长威尔逊又下令，要远东美军当局在对该案进行彻底研究之前，不要把哲腊德交给日本政府。日本前桥地方裁判所虽然接受了前桥地方检察厅对于哲腊德的起诉，但由于美军拒不交出犯人，这一案件的审理工作实际上仍然没有进行。日本人民对此极感愤慨。“日本时报”在评论台湾人民反美事件时说，如果日本的法庭对美国军人没有审判权，台北发生的激烈的反美示威也可能是在日本发生的事件的一种表现，当不是过甚其词的夸大。
    关于相马原事件的审判权的争执，表面上是对于这一事件的发生是否在执行公务时间内，日美双方持有不同看法。根据大大损害了日本主权的日美行政协定的规定，驻日美军人员的犯罪案件，只有发生在非执行公务时间内的，日本方面才有审判权。但驻日美军的所谓“执行公务”甚至有过这样的先例：美国士兵在巡逻中闯入民宅强奸妇女，美军方面也主张应把这看作是“执行公务”，其范围之宽泛，就可以想见了。相马原事件，据调查表明，是发生在美军休息的时间内，是哲腊德故意招引人们去拾取弹壳，然后又驱散他们，开枪击毙了一名妇女的。然而驻日美军却认为这是在“执行公务”。美国众议院有一名议员甚至说：哲腊德是在美国领土上保护美国的财产，使他站到日本法庭上是“令人愤慨”的。这真是奇妙的论调。说这位美国议员先生不懂得地理，是不能令人相信的。这只道穿了一个秘密：在美国占领者和殖民主义者看来，日本根本就不是一个什么国家，更谈不上什么主权和审判权了，美国在哲腊德案件上坚持所谓“执行公务”的说法，其实不过是掩盖这种观点的一个幌子而已。
    “纽约时报”上还有另一种说法，认为对于“以保卫日本人为目的而驻在日本的友好美军”，日本方面不应该有审判权。这种说法几乎值不得加以认真驳斥。因为日本人民早已领教过、并且早已认识清楚美军是怎样“保卫日本人”的了。
    正如雷诺事件仅仅是引起台湾人民积愤爆发的一根导火线一样，日本人民在哲腊德案件上所表现的情绪，也不过是积久的怨愤流露出来的一端罢了。种牡丹者得花，种蒺藜者得刺，造成这种积久的怨愤的根本原因，杜勒斯也承认，是在于美国军队的占领。他在5月29日的记者招待会上说：大批军队驻在外国领土上会引起“不可避免的紧张局势”，“这是一个非常微妙和爆炸性的问题”，“必须寻找比现在已经找到的要好的方法来处理它”。
    关于哲腊德案件，杜勒斯说：美国的代表们在今年3月间就作出了决定，决定在这个案件上“放弃管辖权”。且不说，美国代表们作出的这个决定已被美国国防部部长威尔逊踩在脚下，说美国“放弃”对哲腊德案件的管辖权这种说法，也包含着很大的欺骗性。既然说“放弃”，那末就是说“权力”本来是属于美国的了。美国“放弃”了本来属于它的“权力”，日本人理应感恩、知足。可是又是谁给了美国这种“权力”呢？还不是美国自封的吗？根本的问题在于美国在别人的国家里就不应该驻有军队，就不应该占有基地，就不应该拥有治外法权之类的“权力”。解决杜勒斯所说的“爆炸性问题”的最好的办法，莫过于撤退军队，撤销在外国领土上的军事基地，可是美国又作不到，也不想这样作。帝国主义的不可避免的悲剧也就在这里。它明明知道坐在火药桶上，可是它却把火药桶当作安乐椅，坐上就不想离开。那末还有什么更好的解决办法呢？那就只有让它在爆炸中升天了！
