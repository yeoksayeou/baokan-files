The theory of those who profit from calamity
　　Miao Gong

Those who profit from calamity have always been despised. When neighbors, relatives, and friends are busy helping to put out a fire, some people mix in to loot property; undoubtedly, people will catch them on the spot.

However, the person profiting from the fire shouts: Isn't your goal to put out the fire? Why are you grabbing my hand instead! – As if the mistake wasn't his, but rather that those who stopped him from profiting from the fire had misunderstood the goal.

Mr. Zhang Yunchuan "saw the news of the China Democratic League Central Committee's forum published in the People's Daily and Guangming Daily, and upon reading the content, it wasn't about offering opinions to the Communist Party or helping with rectification, but instead became about offering opinions to Zhang Yunchuan," and "felt very strange!"

Because it is the "wind" of rectifying the Communist Party, any incorrect opinions that appear during the rectification cannot be criticized. This reasoning is like saying that because you're putting out a fire, you must turn a blind eye to robbery.

Of course, the Communist Party has not caught fire, and rectification is not firefighting. But in the eyes of some people, the Communist Party is now in dire straits, teetering on the brink, so they excitedly rushed over—they didn't come to "put out the fire," but to take the opportunity to grab a share, moving boxes and cabinets out. Unexpectedly, their hands were grabbed as soon as they were stretched out. It turned out that people didn't, as they thought, fail to distinguish between those profiting from the fire because they were busy putting it out.

Zhang Bojun said that others are now criticizing him "to correct the deviations that occurred in helping the CCP with rectification."

Various things inevitably have deviations, and there may be deviations in firefighting as well, but if a person who intends to profit from the fire wants to make people believe that he was originally sincerely helping to put out the fire, but was only slightly "deviated" or "off" a bit, then it may be very difficult.

Only allow firefighting, don't allow preventing profiting from the fire, otherwise, you've messed up the goal – this is called the theory of goals. Profiting from the fire is just a deviation from helping to put out the fire—this is called the theory of deviations. These two sets of theories are welcomed by all those who profit from the fire, because according to these two sets of theories, the mistake made by those who profit from the fire is only a small one, while the people who stop the fire profiteers have made a big mistake.

　　趁火打劫者的理论
　　苗工
    趁火打劫的人从来是为人所不齿的。当左邻右舍、亲戚朋友忙着帮助救火的时候，有人混在里面抢劫财物；毫无疑问，人们当场就会把他捉住。
    然而趁火打劫的人喊叫起来了：你们的目标不是救火么？怎么倒过来捉住我的手！——好像错的并不是他，反而是制止他趁火打劫的人弄错了目标。
    张云川先生“看到人民日报和光明日报上登着农工民主党中央座谈的消息，一看内容，不是对共产党提意见，帮助整风，却变成了对张云川提意见”，“甚觉稀奇！”
    因为是整共产党的“风”，所以对于在整风中出现的任何错误意见都不能批评。这种道理就好像是说因为救火，就必须睁着眼睛让人来打劫一样。
    当然，共产党并未失火，整风也不是救火。但在某些人的眼睛里，共产党现在是大难临头，岌岌可危，于是他们兴奋地赶来了，——他们并不是来“救火”，而是乘机捞一把，把箱子柜子什么的往外搬。出乎他们意料之外，手刚刚伸出来的时候就被捉住了。原来人们并没有像他们所想的那样，因为忙于救火连趁火打劫的人也分辨不出来。
    章伯钧说，现在别人批评他，“是纠正帮助中共整风中发生的偏差”。
    各种事情都难免出偏差，在救火中大概也可能有偏差，但是如果存心趁火打劫的人要想使人相信他原是真心诚意帮人救火，不过稍为“偏”了一点，“差”了一点罢了，那恐怕是很困难的。
    只准救火，不准防止趁火打劫，否则就是乱了目标，——此之谓目标论。趁火打劫却不过是帮忙救火的偏差，——此之谓偏差论。这两套理论是各种趁火打劫者所欢迎的，因为按照这两套理论，趁火打劫者所犯的不过是小小的错误，而制止乘火打劫的人倒是犯了大大的错误了。
