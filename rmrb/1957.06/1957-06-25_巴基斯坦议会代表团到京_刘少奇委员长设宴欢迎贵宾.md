Xinhua News Agency, June 24th—The Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation, headed by Mujibur Rahman, General Secretary of the East Pakistan Awami League, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon from Guangzhou.

Vice Chairman Li Jishen delivered a speech at the airport, extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people.

He said that our two countries have repeatedly sent delegations to each other for friendly visits. Now we are particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation visiting our country in our capital. We believe that the establishment of direct contact between the parliaments of the two countries will play a significant role in strengthening mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and developing friendly cooperation between the two countries. The consolidation and development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan will help the common prosperity of the two countries and peace in Asia and the world.

He hoped that the distinguished guests would have a pleasant visit in China, as if in the home of an old friend they have not seen for a long time.

Mujibur Rahman said at the airport: We bring the greetings and good wishes of the people, government, and parliament of Pakistan to the people, government, and National People's Congress of China. We have watched with deep interest and deep admiration the rapid progress made by this great country in all aspects under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. Now we are here to see your progress for ourselves.

He said that the relationship between Pakistan and China is pleasant and harmonious, and our friendship will be strengthened day by day in the years to come through frequent mutual visits.

Mujibur Rahman added that the progress you have made in recent years is worthy of attention, and your activities have attracted the attention of other countries.

In terms of international relations, he said, we believe in friendship and mutual respect. We are willing and determined to cooperate with all countries that defend peace.

He also said: "We fully understand the contributions made by your country's great leaders, such as Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, etc. They are in fact the architects of modern China, and it is under their leadership that your country has seen astonishing and comprehensive development."

Finally, he shouted: "Pakistan and China are brothers."

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation today were Vice Chairman Chen Shutong and members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Geng Biao, heads of various people's organizations, the Vice Mayor of Beijing, and people from all walks of life.

Pakistani Ambassador to China, Ahmad, and his wife were also at the airport to welcome the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th—Chairman Liu Shaoqi hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation headed by Mujibur Rahman.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the guests.

He said that China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. The people of our two countries share a common desire to develop friendly relations, and there are only common interests between the people of our two countries, and no conflict of interest. Therefore, although our two countries speak different languages and have different political systems, this does not prevent us from establishing friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

Liu Shaoqi then described the continuous increase in the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan.

Finally, he said that China is carrying out economic and cultural construction in a planned way, but it has only been a few years, and in many aspects it is still backward. We sincerely hope that the distinguished guests will be able to learn more about our country's situation during their visit, see our good and progressive aspects, and also see our shortcomings and backward aspects, and give us unceremonious guidance. He said, we firmly believe that through your friendly visit, the establishment of direct contact between the parliaments of the two countries will not only further enhance understanding and friendship between our two countries, but also contribute to the unity of Asian countries and the cause of world peace.

Mujibur Rahman said at the meeting that the friendly relations between our two countries have a history of two thousand years. We have both suffered from the oppression of imperialism and colonialism in the past, and the people of both countries have endured suffering and paid many lives in the struggle against colonialism for independence and freedom.

He said that we have begun to build our own country, and we, like you, still have difficulties in all aspects, but we are carrying out construction. Only in this way can people be spared from hunger. We feel that there should be a peaceful environment in the world, and if there is no peace, people will suffer. Our government and people, like the government and people of China, are demanding peace.

He also said that the Pakistani government and people are eager to establish economic, cultural, and trade relations with China.

Pakistani Ambassador to China, Ahmad, and his wife were also invited to attend.

Also present were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Saifudin and members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Geng Biao, President of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association Liu Geping, heads of other people's organizations, and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

    在国际关系方面，他说，我们相信友好和互相尊重。我们愿意和决心保卫和平的一切国家共同合作。
    他又说：“我们完全了解贵国伟大的领袖们，如像毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理等等领袖们所作出的贡献，他们事实上是现代中国的建筑师，而且正是在他们的领导下，贵国才出现了惊人的全面的发展。”
