Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Paris Dispatch: The French National Assembly approved Radical Socialist Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury as the new French Prime Minister by a vote of 240 to 194 on the evening of June 12th. This is the smallest majority a new Prime Minister has received in a confidence vote in the National Assembly since the first President of the French Fourth Republic took office in January 1947.

Those voting in favor were mainly Radical Socialists, Socialists, and most members of conservative parties. The Popular Republican Movement abstained. Left-wing Radical Socialists, led by Mendès France, voted against. It is reported that the Socialist parliamentary group and executive committee only decided to support Bourgès-Maunoury by a majority of fifteen votes. A spokesman for the conservative parties also said that their vote in favor did not necessarily mean they approved of the new Prime Minister's program, but rather because France urgently needed a government.

Before the vote, Bourgès-Maunoury presented his program to the parliament: to continue military operations in Algeria while carrying out some kind of "political reform"; to reduce domestic consumption, increase production and exports, levy new taxes of 150 billion francs, and cut budget expenditures by 250 billion francs, in order to prevent the current "serious" French financial situation from deteriorating further into a "dramatic" one; to strengthen the North Atlantic Group, to have the parliament approve the two treaties of the Western European "Common Market" and "Euratom" before mid-July, and to actively engage in negotiations for a Western European "Free Trade Area"; to amend the constitution to "expand" executive power and increase government "stability"; and to accelerate the development of oil and other resources in the Sahara region.

Bourgès-Maunoury admitted that France's finances were on the verge of collapse, and that it would be inevitable to use the gold reserves of the Bank of France by the end of this month.

The parliament reacted coldly to Bourgès-Maunoury's speech. After the vote, many members in the parliament lounge believed that the new cabinet would only be "filling the gap before autumn."

Observers believe that the narrow majority obtained by Bourgès-Maunoury precisely demonstrates the serious divisions in the National Assembly on the issues of Algeria and fiscal policy.

　　获得法国议会中微弱多数支持
　　布歇—莫努里勉强就任总理
    据新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会12日晚上以二百四十票对一百九十四票批准激进社会党人布歇—莫努里就任法国新总理。从1947年1月法兰西第四共和国第一任总统上任以来，这是一个新总理在国民议会授权投票中所获得的最微弱的多数票。
    投赞成票的主要是激进社会党人、社会党人和保守党派的大部分议员。人民共和党弃权。以孟戴斯—弗朗斯为首的激进社会党左翼议员投了反对票。据报道，社会党议会党团和执行委员会当时是仅以十五票的多数决定支持布歇—莫努里的。而保守党派的发言人也说，他们投赞成票并不一定是因为赞成新总理的政纲，而是因为法国迫切需要有一个政府。
    在投票以前，布歇—莫努里向议会提出他的政纲：继续对阿尔及利亚采取军事行动，同时进行某种“政治改革”；减缩国内消费，增加生产和出口，征收新税一千五百亿法郎，削减预算开支二千五百亿法郎，以便阻止目前已经很“严重的”法国财政情况进一步恶化成为“戏剧性的”；加强北大西洋集团，在7月中旬以前使议会批准西欧“共同市场”和“原子联营”两条约，并且积极从事于西欧“自由贸易区”的谈判；修改宪法，以“扩大”行政权和增进政府的“稳定性”；加速开发撒哈拉地区的石油和其他富源。
    布歇—莫努里承认，法国的财政正面临着崩溃的边缘，本月底就不可避免地要动用法兰西银行的黄金储备了。
    议会对布歇—莫努里的演说反应冷淡。在表决之后，在议会休息室里有不少议员认为新阁将不过是“填补秋季以前的空隙的”。
    观察家们认为，布歇—莫努里所获得的微弱多数正是表明国民议会在阿尔及利亚和财政政策两个问题上的严重分歧。
