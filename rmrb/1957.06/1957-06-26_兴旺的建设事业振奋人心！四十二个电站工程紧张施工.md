Xinhua News Agency, June 25th -- A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the Ministry of Electric Power Industry: Currently, there are forty-two large and medium-sized thermal and hydroelectric power stations under intense construction in our country. In addition, sixteen power stations are also actively preparing for construction and will soon begin construction one after another.

These power stations are widely distributed, covering twenty-two provinces and autonomous regions from Xinjiang to Yunnan, and from Heilongjiang to Guangdong. It is estimated that before the end of this year, more than 500,000 kilowatts of generating equipment will be put into production successively. Thus, together with the 1.41 million kilowatts of generating equipment that has been put into production in the previous four years, by the beginning of next year, the generating equipment capacity of the state-owned electric power industry will increase by one and a half times compared to the beginning of 1953, exceeding the first Five-Year Plan by about 4%.

The twenty-four power stations that the Soviet Union helped our country build during the first Five-Year Plan, except for a part that has been completed, most of the rest can start generating electricity this year, and some are about to be fully completed. For example, the Fushun Power Plant, which was expanded by the Soviet Union in 1952 to help our country, can complete the fourth phase of the project this year. The first phase of the Jilin Thermal Power Station, which started construction in 1954, will also be fully completed this year. The thermal power stations in new industrial cities such as Lanzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Luoyang, which started construction in the second half of the year before last and last year, will all start partial power generation this year.

Most of these newly built and expanded power stations have very large power generation capabilities. For example, after the two sets of generating equipment being installed in the Lanzhou Thermal Power Station are put into production in the third and fourth quarters respectively, its power generation capacity will be more than twice the original power generation capacity of the entire city of Lanzhou. Xi'an, a city where the electric power industry has developed rapidly in recent years, will also increase its power generation capacity by two times after the several sets of generating equipment currently under construction start generating electricity.

Due to the improvement of our country's design level and the manufacturing level of the machinery industry, there are more power stations designed and manufactured by our country this year than in any previous year. Most of the eleven large and medium-sized hydropower stations currently under construction are designed by our own technicians. About 20% of the more than 500,000 kilowatts of generating equipment to be put into production this year are manufactured domestically.

### 兴旺的建设事业振奋人心！四十二个电站工程紧张施工

　　兴旺的建设事业振奋人心！
　　四十二个电站工程紧张施工
    新华社25日讯  新华社记者从电力工业部获悉：目前我国有四十二个大、中型火力和水力发电站正在紧张施工，另外有十六个电站也在积极进行施工准备工作，不久可以陆续动工建设。
    这些电站分布很广，遍及从新疆到云南、从黑龙江到广东的二十二个省份和自治区；预计在今年年底以前，将有五十多万瓩左右的发电设备陆续投入生产。这样，加上前四年已经投入生产的一百四十一万瓩的发电设备，明年年初，国营电力工业的发电设备能力，将比1953年初增加一倍半，超过第一个五年计划规定4％左右。
    苏联帮助我国在第一个五年计划期间建设的二十四个电站，除了一部分已经完工的以外，其余大部分都在今年可以开始发电，有的快要全部建成。例如在1952年由苏联帮助我国扩建的抚顺电厂，今年就可以全部完成第四期工程。1954年开始建设的吉林热电站，第一期工程也将在今年全部完工。其他在前年下半年和去年才动工建设的兰州、西安、成都、武汉、洛阳等新工业城市的热电站，都将在今年开始部分发电。
    这些新建和扩建的电站，大多数是发电能力很大的。例如兰州热电站正在安装的两套发电设备，三、四两季先后投入生产后，它的发电能力就将比兰州全市原有发电能力还要大两倍以上。几年来电力工业发展很快的西安市，在目前正在建设的几套发电设备开始发电后，发电能力也将比现在增加二倍。
    由于我国设计水平和机械工业制造水平的提高，今年施工的由我国自己设计并且自己制造设备的电站，也比过去任何一年都多。目前正在施工的十一个大、中型水电站，大部分是由我国技术人员自己设计的。准备在今年投入生产的五十多万瓩容量的发电设备中，有20％左右是国内制造的。
