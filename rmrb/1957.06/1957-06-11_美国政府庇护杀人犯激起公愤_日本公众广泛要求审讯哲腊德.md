　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The decision made by the American court on June 6th not to hand over American soldier Girard, who killed Japanese farmer Sakai Naka, to the Japanese court for trial continues to be met with fierce criticism from all sectors of Japan.

　　Japanese Minister of Justice Umeji Nakamura stated in a conversation this afternoon that American domestic public opinion only focuses on the fact that the incident occurred on a training ground, forgetting that Girard's actions that caused Sakai Naka's death were unrelated to performing official duties. Moreover, this issue was fully discussed by the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, a formal body established according to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty's administrative agreement, before the conclusion was reached that jurisdiction belonged to Japan. In accordance with international faith, the decision made by the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee should be observed by the people of both countries.

　　Director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, Taiji Imoto, also stated today that if the United States disregards Japanese public opinion and sends Girard back to the American court for trial, it may arouse strong anti-American sentiment in Japan.

　　Professor Akira Nakamura of Japan's Hosei University said today that the American discussion of the Girard incident is "an emotional outburst based on excessive racial prejudice." Nakamura pointed out that the American belief that U.S. military personnel stationed abroad should be tried according to American law clearly implies infringing on the sovereignty of the host country. If Americans believe that Japan has no jurisdiction because this incident occurred while Girard was performing his duties, then Japan cannot allow such life-threatening "official duties" to exist around the Japanese people. The professor further pointed out that international law always takes precedence over national law in any case involving more than two countries, which is "an unshakable common sense."

　　Both "Asahi Shimbun" and "Tokyo Shimbun" published articles yesterday criticizing the American "racial prejudice" in the Girard incident. "Asahi Shimbun" even published a cartoon today. The cartoon depicted Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi landing in the United States by plane, while an American cowboy pointed a gun at him, telling him to send Girard back to the United States, thus satirizing the overbearing attitude adopted by the United States in the Girard case.

　　美国政府庇护杀人犯激起公愤
    日本公众广泛要求审讯哲腊德
    新华社10日讯  东京消息：美国法院在6月6日作出的不把杀害日本农妇坂井中的美国兵哲腊德交给日本法院审讯的决定继续遭到日本各方面的猛烈抨击。
    日本法务相中村梅吉在今天下午发表的谈话中指出，美国国内的舆论只是眼着于这一事件是在演习场发生的，而忘记了造成坂井中死亡的哲腊德的行为同执行公务没有关系这一点。而且这一问题是经过根据日美安全条约的两国行政协定而设立的日美联合委员会这一正式机构充分讨论以后，才作出裁判权属于日本的结论的。按照国际信义来说，日美联合委员会作出的这个决定，两国国民是应该遵守的。
    法务省刑事局长井本台吉今天也表示，美国要是不顾日本的舆论将哲腊德送回美国法院审判，可能会在日本引起强烈的反美情绪。
    日本法政大学教授中村明（译音）今天说，美国人对哲腊德事件的议论，是“基于种族偏见的过多的感情用事”。中村明指出，美国人认为驻扎在国外的美军人员应该依照美国法律来审理，这显然意味着侵犯驻在国的主权。要是美国人认为由于这一事件是哲腊德在执行公务的时候发生的，日本就没有管辖权，那么，日本就不能允许在日本人民周围有这种危害人命的“公务”存在。这位教授还进一步指出，国际法在牵涉到两国以上的任何案件中，总是优先于国家法的，这是“确定不移的常识”。
    “朝日新闻”和“东京新闻”昨天都曾发表了文章，指责美国在哲腊德事件上的“种族偏见”。“朝日新闻”今天并且发表了一幅漫画。漫画画着日本首相岸信介乘飞机在美国着陆时，一个美国牧童用手枪逼着他，叫他把哲腊德送回美国，以此来讽刺美国在哲腊德案件上所采取的横蛮态度。
