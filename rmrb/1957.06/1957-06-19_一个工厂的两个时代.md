Two Eras of a Factory

　　The predecessor of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory was called "Jin Gong Group of Shanghai Manufacturing Factory, Central Electrical Equipment Company" before liberation, which the bureaucratic bourgeoisie used as a tool to swindle wealth from the people. Before liberation, the factory buildings were dilapidated, some machines were stolen and sold, and some were abandoned in the corners to rust. The number of employees was reduced to just over a hundred, and normal production could not be carried out. It could only produce small motors and transformers. In the situation at that time when foreign goods filled the market, even these small products could not be sold. Thus, it became an incomplete "lane factory" specializing in repair and assembly work for foreign firms.

　　After liberation, the factory's productivity was brought into full play. After a series of reforms and expansions, it is now a large-scale factory with more than 4,000 workers. Rightist elements say "the Communist Party's leadership is terrible" and "people's lives have not improved"... Please look at the iron facts! Comparing the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory in 1949 at the time of liberation with the 1957 plan, its total output value has increased by more than 63 times, labor productivity has increased by more than 5 times, the average wage of workers has increased from 37 yuan to 76.5 yuan, employees enjoy labor insurance benefits, and the factory has also established many collective welfare undertakings. Workers have also entered the technical school and night university established by the factory, striving to be cultured workers.

　　The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, like many factories across the country, has embarked on a brilliant future.

　　Before liberation, it could only manufacture motors and transformers of 150 kilowatts and 500 kilovolt-amperes or less. The lower picture is the 150 kilowatt motor manufactured at that time. Now it can manufacture 750 kilowatt motors and 20,000 kilovolt-ampere transformers. Before liberation, generators could not be manufactured at all. After liberation, they can be manufactured. The upper picture is a 12,000 kilowatt large steam turbine generator manufactured last year. This year, it is also planned to trial produce a larger 25,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator.

　　In the first quarter of this year, the rotating motor workshop of the Electric Motor Factory manufactured 2,274 motors, 264 DC machines, and 343 AC generators to support national construction. The picture on the right is a corner of the painting room in the rotating workshop.

　　The upper picture is the exterior view of the current factory buildings. The factory building area is eleven times larger than before liberation. The picture on the right is the interior view of the spacious workshop.

　　The picture below is the gate in the past.

　　Before liberation, the employee dormitory was so dark and damp (upper picture).

　　From liberation to now, the factory has built more than 1,000 houses for employee families. Children and mothers look into the distance from the dormitory window (upper left picture).

　　一个工厂的两个时代
    上海电机厂的前身在解放前夕叫做“中央电工器材公司上海制造厂金工组”，官僚资产阶级把它作为向人民骗取财富的工具。解放前，这个工厂厂房破烂不堪，机器有的被盗卖了，有的被抛弃在墙角生锈，职工被裁减到只有一百多人，不能进行正常生产，只能生产小型的马达和变压器，在当时外国货充塞市场的情况下。就是这些小产品也卖不出去，于是它变成了专门替洋行做修理、装配等零活的一个残缺不全的“弄堂工厂”。
    解放后，这个厂的生产力得到了充分的发挥，经过一系列的改革和扩建，现在已经是一座规模宏大的、有四千多工人的工厂了。右派分子说“共产党领导糟了”“人民生活没有提高”……请看铁的事实吧！如果把上海电机厂1949年解放时与1957年的计划相比，它的总产值提高了六十三倍多，劳动生产率提高了五倍多，工人的平均工资从三十七元增加到七十六元五角，职工都享受到劳动保险的待遇，工厂还创办了许多集体福利事业，工人们还进了本厂创办的技术学校和夜大学，争取做一个有文化的工人。
    上海电机厂同全国许多工厂一样，走上了灿烂的前程。

    解放前只能制造一百五十瓩、五百千伏安以下的电动机和变压器。下图是那时制造的一百五十瓩电动机。现在能制造七百五十瓩的电动机，二万千伏安的变压器了。解放前根本不能制造发电机，解放后能够制造了。上图是去年制造的一万二千瓩大型汽轮发电机。今年还准备试制更大的二万五千瓩汽轮发电机。
    电机厂旋转电机车间今年第一季度里制造了二千二百七十四台电动机、二百六十四台直流机和三百四十三台交流发电机，来支援国家建设。右图是旋转车间油漆间的一角。
    上图是现在的厂房外貌。这个厂的厂房面积比解放前扩大了十一倍。右图是宽敞的车间内景。
    下图是过去的大门。
    解放前职工宿舍是这样的阴暗潮湿（上图）。
    从解放到现在，厂里共盖了一千多户职工家属宿舍。孩子和母亲在宿舍窗前眺望远处（左上图）。
