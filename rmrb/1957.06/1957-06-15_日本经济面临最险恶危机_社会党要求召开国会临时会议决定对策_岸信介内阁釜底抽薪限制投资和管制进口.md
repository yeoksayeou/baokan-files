　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party demanded on the 13th that the government immediately convene a special session of the Diet to decide on measures to cope with the worsening of Japan's balance of international payments. The Socialist Party pointed out that the fiscal and economic policies of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet are already on the verge of bankruptcy.

　　In a statement on the issue of the deteriorating balance of international payments, the Socialist Party demanded that the government be held accountable. The statement said that due to the deterioration of the balance of international payments, the Japanese economy is already facing the direst crisis. This is due to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's "unprecedentedly bad governance" and "tragic errors in economic estimations," and also the result of the conservative parties' unplanned policies over the years to maintain the expansion of the scale of the monopoly capital economy.

　　In its statement, the Socialist Party expressed its advocacy for formulating a plan to fundamentally rebuild the Japanese economy in accordance with the method of a planned economy.

　　To cope with the grim situation of a further worsening of the balance of international payments, the Japanese Cabinet approved a basic economic plan on the 14th.

　　This plan, hastily drafted by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, does not propose specific measures, but only generally stipulates that imports should be controlled and exports encouraged through fiscal measures. The plan also stipulates that government investment this year should be limited, equipment investment by private enterprises should be curbed, long-term loan interest rates should be increased, efforts should be made to stabilize prices, and private savings should be encouraged. The plan also stipulates that loans should be obtained from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

　　Not long ago, Japanese Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda had already revealed this drastic plan. At the time, Japanese newspapers pointed out that this marked the collapse of the foundation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's "active finance."

　　The so-called "active finance" is to expand equipment investment, increase exports, and balance international payments. However, as a result of the continuous growth of equipment investment and imported materials, Japan has had a monthly trade surplus in its foreign trade since the beginning of this year. In order to restrict imports and improve international income, the Japanese government has taken various measures to tighten finance. However, the balance of international payments in May showed a deficit of 117 million US dollars, the highest record since the war. The trade deficit in tangible goods was as high as 214 million US dollars, 6 million US dollars more than in April. Currently, the Bank of Japan is studying the issue of raising the official discount rate for the third time.

　　The financial tension and chaos have already affected the execution of equipment investment plans in important industrial sectors. The shipbuilding industry, which had the best business last year, will cut its shipbuilding plan for this year, originally valued at 13.85 billion yen, by half. The second steel production plan, which began last year, will have to be postponed if necessary due to difficulties in obtaining bank loans and issuing corporate bonds. The 1957 power development plan is also being prepared for revision. In addition, the machinery industry, the rubber industry, and the trading community are even more deeply affected by the financial tension. Inagaki Heitaro, president of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, said that the measures to tighten finance have hindered exports.

　　At the same time, the Japanese munitions industry, which once gained "prosperity" during the Korean War, is now also facing the "greatest crisis."

　　Japanese industry insiders say that the reasons for this crisis are: the US military's past orders have all been produced by the end of February, and the US military has stopped purchasing new munitions in Japan; the Japanese Self-Defense Forces' munitions orders have been delayed until now due to the preparation of procurement plans.

　　Under these circumstances, Asahi Okuma Industries, which manufactures artillery shells, has considered using its equipment to produce ammunition for hunting starting in September. Toyo Seiki Industrial Co. recently intended to stop producing munitions and produce lipstick tubes instead, but was unsuccessful.

　　According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been forced to consider allocating a subsidy of 70 million yen to maintain the production equipment of the Japanese munitions industry. However, munitions manufacturing companies are still worried that the practice of relying on loans to overcome the crisis cannot continue for long.

　　日本经济面临最险恶危机
　　社会党要求召开国会临时会议决定对策
　　岸信介内阁釜底抽薪限制投资和管制进口
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本社会党13日要求政府立即召开国会临时会议，来决定应付日本国际收支恶化的办法。社会党指出，岸信介内阁的财政经济政策已经面临破产的边缘了。
    社会党在就国际收支恶化问题发表的一项声明中，要求追究政府的责任。声明说，由于国际收支恶化，日本经济已经面临着最险恶的危机。这是由于岸信介内阁的“空前的恶政”和“在经济估计方面的悲惨的错误”而造成的，也是保守政党几年来无计划地维护垄断资本的扩大经济规模的方针的结果。
    社会党在声明中表示主张按照计划经济的方式，制定从根本上来重建日本经济的方案。
    为应付国际收支进一步恶化的险恶局势，日本内阁14日批准了一项基本经济计划。
    这项由执政党自由民主党匆匆草拟出的计划没有提出具体的措施，只一般地规定要管制进口，并且通过采取财政措施来鼓励出口。计划并且规定要限制今年的政府投资，抑制私人企业的装备投资，提高长期贷款的利息，争取稳定物价和鼓励私人储蓄。计划还规定要取得国际货币基金组织和世界银行的贷款。
    不久以前，日本藏相池田勇人已经透露了这个釜底抽薪的计划，当时日本报纸指出，这标志岸信介内阁“积极财政”的基础在崩溃。
    所谓“积极财政”，是扩大设备投资，增加输出，使国际收支平衡。但是，由于设备投资和进口物资一直增长的结果，今年以来日本在对外贸易上月月入超。为了限制输入和使国际收入好转，日本政府曾经采取了各种紧缩金融的措施。可是，5月份的国际收支却出现了战后最高纪录的一亿一千七百万美元的赤字，有形贸易入超高达两亿一千四百万美元，比4月份还多六百万美元。目前，日本银行在研究第三次提高公定利率的问题。
    金融财政的紧张和混乱已经影响到重要产业部门的设备投资计划的执行。去年生意最好的造船工业，将把原订的价值一百三十八亿五千万日元的今年度造船计划削减一半。从去年开始的第二次钢铁生产计划，由于银行贷款和发行公司债券的困难，必要时将只好把计划推迟。1957年度的电力开发计划也在准备修改。此外，机器业、橡胶业和贸易界更是受到金融紧张的深刻影响。日本贸易会会长稻垣平太郎说，紧缩金融措施反而阻碍了输出。
    与此同时，曾经在朝鲜战争时期获得“繁荣”的日本军火工业，现在也面临着“最大的危机”。
    日本工业界人士说，发生这次危机的原因是：美军过去的订货已经在2月底全部生产完毕，而美军又停止在日本购买新的军火；日本自卫队的军火订货由于准备采购计划，延迟到现在还没有发出。
    在这种情况下，制造炮弹的旭大隈产业公司已经考虑要从9月开始把它的设备用来生产打猎用的弹药。东洋精机工业公司最近曾经打算不再生产军火，而生产装口红的管子，但是没有成功。
    据共同社说，日本通商产业省已经被迫考虑要拨出七千万日元的补助，来维持日本军火工业的生产装备。但是，军火制造公司仍然担心依靠贷款渡过危机的做法不能继续很久。
