　　Quick Sketch of the Siming Mountain Area
　　——Travel Notes from Eastern Zhejiang
　　Ai Wu
　　The mountains on both sides, layer upon layer, are densely covered with green trees and verdant bamboos, appearing extremely beautiful. In the middle, a narrow flatland is filled with lush bamboo forests, growing many brown bamboo shoots, marking the abundance of forestry in the mountains. Occasionally, a patch of green potato fields and peanut fields, along with the fine sunny weather, appear bright and open. The small river flows through the bamboo forest, so clear that the stones at the bottom can be seen. In some places, the water hits the stones in the river, making a sound and splashing white, dazzling water. The flat road follows the small river, sometimes crossing the river on small bridges to the left bank, and sometimes to the right bank. The narrow flatland between the two mountains is winding. When we walk on the road, we often look ahead and always see peaks of green trees and verdant bamboo without a path to follow. Looking back, we also see no way we came, also a scene of mountains and trees, as if we are always surrounded by mountains and bamboo trees. This is the Siming Mountain area, belonging to Yuyao County, Zhejiang. The mountain area is extremely quiet, except for the occasional sound of water from the small river, often there are birds singing crisply "Er - Gui Jie Er".

　　There used to be a folk song in the Siming Mountain area: "Siming Mountain, mountains within mountains, bays within bays, bandits everywhere in the mountains." This describes the terrain of the mountain area and also illustrates the uneasy environment of the past. From my intuition, it is indeed a good place to hide bandits. The mountains are deep and the forests are dense, and within a dozen steps around you, you can't figure out what is hidden. In 1939, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Communist Party members came to work in the mountain area. In 1941, a guerrilla team was formally organized, called the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Detachments of the Eastern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column (referred to by the common people as the Third and Fifth Detachments), making the Siming Mountain area, five or six hundred miles around, a strong base for resisting Japan in eastern Zhejiang. In 1945, the entire Eastern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column withdrew north to Shandong and joined the main force of the New Fourth Army. Some other Party members stayed behind and, seeing the increasingly reactionary Kuomintang, re-developed the guerrilla team until liberation. Since the Siming Mountain area had a guerrilla team, it changed the previous situation, bandits disappeared, and it became a glorious revolutionary base. On the day I entered the Siming Mountain area, I saw many people walking on the road, some carrying spring bamboo shoots, some carrying woven bamboo wares, and some transporting long bamboos on iron-wheeled carts to sell in Lubu. Lubu is a town surrounded by mountains and rivers, with cars and wooden boats directly to Yuyao County. I stayed overnight in the town and learned that the lives of the people in the mountain area had undergone great changes. There are large department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in the town. Bamboo ware, tea, local product purchasing stations, and so on, are everywhere. This shows the prosperity of the people's lives and the flourishing of their careers.

　　Around ten o'clock in the morning, I saw several umbrellas hanging on the bamboo trees by the roadside in two places, still with blue cloth covers, showing the umbrella owners' attention and care for the umbrellas. But there was no one there, and there were no houses nearby, just mountains and bamboo forests. This made me very strange. I asked passers-by to understand that people in the mountain recesses carry things to Lubu to sell. They brought umbrellas early in the morning. Seeing that the weather was getting clearer and clearer, they felt that carrying an umbrella was a burden, so they hung it on the bamboo trees by the roadside, so that after selling things in Lubu, they could return empty-handed and then take it back. After saying this, I was even more surprised that in a place where "bandits were everywhere" in the past, there was an unattended storage place, which is really a rare thing in the world!

　　At noon, I arrived at a mountain village called Duxu. Many houses are densely arranged along the mountain and stream, about three miles long. There are 446 households with a population of more than 2,400 people. Behind the village houses, there are steep mountains covered with moso bamboo and pine trees. In front of the village houses, a small stream flows, and the stream water hits the giant rocks, making a rustling sound. On the other side of the mountain stream are steep mountains covered with bamboo forests, making the entire mountain village, even under the strong sunshine of noon in the south, appear shady and extraordinarily cool. There is no farmland here, and the residents live by the mountain forests. In their conversation, they said they are mountain people, indicating a distinction from farmers. This can also be seen from the name of their cooperative, "Nanshan Bamboo Mat Cooperative." The people of the entire mountain village are weaving bamboo mats, which are supplied to farmers for drying grain and to cities for building cool sheds. At the same time, it is also divided labor with other mountain villages. Some other mountain villages specialize in making bamboo chairs, some specialize in weaving bamboo baskets, and here they specialize in weaving bamboo mats. Before liberation, in the off-season, the money from selling each bamboo mat could buy ten catties of rice, sometimes only six catties of rice; in the peak season, it could buy fifty catties of grain. Now that cooperatives have been organized and sold in large quantities to state-organized purchasing stations, there is no distinction between off-season and peak season, and the money from selling each bamboo mat can often buy fifty-five catties of grain. A cooperative member can earn 1.94 yuan for a work day. Moreover, as long as a cooperative member is diligent, they can guarantee to earn a work day a day.

　　In this mountain village, there is also a special situation, that is, because there are no landlords, only rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants, there has been no land reform. When organizing the cooperative, people with bamboo forests invested bamboo as capital into the cooperative. For every hundred catties of bamboo cut and woven into bamboo mats, 0.35 yuan is extracted from the money earned as remuneration for the bamboo forest owner. But this is only limited to the bamboo that grew before joining the cooperative. The newly grown bamboo after joining the cooperative, because it has been fertilized and cultivated by the cooperative, belongs to the collective ownership of the cooperative, and the cooperative members no longer receive additional benefits from the bamboo forest. Because the cooperative has been very successful in cultivating bamboo forests, the middle peasants are very satisfied. The poor peasants, that is, those who rely solely on manual labor, previously had to buy bamboo to weave bamboo mats or help people weave bamboo mats to earn wages, and often suffered from not being able to buy bamboo or being unemployed. Now they are all guaranteed in their lives and will not be exploited. They love the cooperative and enthusiastically protect the mountain forests. In order to cultivate bamboo forests, the cooperative does not cut them down randomly, but often goes to other places to buy bamboo to make bamboo mats. At the same time, it is also because the cooperative members' work enthusiasm has increased, and a large amount of bamboo is needed for processing. Before liberation, Duxu'ao also had the situation of transporting raw materials out to sell, but now it only sells handicrafts. A folk song popular in the mountain village best expresses their current life.

　　Duxu'ao person Afutou:
　　Hongshan moso bamboo carried to the knees;
　　A Xie's family opens a hospital;
　　Guangshengtang opens a silver shop;
　　Soy sauce and sesame oil are set in the temple;
　　Snow-white shirt with turned-up collar.
　　Young people show off,
　　Fountain pen inserted in the chest.

　　The first sentence is about how the people of Duxu'ao are blessed now. The following describes the situation of being blessed. The second sentence is about the moso bamboo from Hongshan being transported to Duxu'ao, allowing the people of Duxu'ao to put it on their knees to weave bamboo mats. The third sentence is about how a joint clinic is set up in cooperative member A Xie's home. The fourth sentence is about how a credit cooperative is set up in the village's pharmacy, Guangshengtang. The fifth sentence is about how the supply and marketing cooperative is set up in the temple, selling daily necessities such as soy sauce and sesame oil. The sixth sentence is about the new-style clothes that people wear. These are all situations that did not exist in the mountain village before, but now they exist, so they feel happy. The last two sentences express the life of young people, which is both pleasant and energetic.

　　When I entered the village, what surprised me first was that many families were building new buildings. The stone walls, thick wooden beams, and solid floorboards gave people a strong impression of a prosperous life. Now the average deposit per household in the cooperative can buy 1,000 catties of grain. The cooperative's public accumulation fund, calculated in one year and two months, has reached 28,000 yuan. I borrowed a room in a cooperative member's home at night, and the quilt cover was all silk.

　　The people in this mountain village love labor, which is very good. However, it is not right to have children participate in handicraft work too early. For example, when the senior class of the village's central primary school graduated this year, only twelve students were left to prepare for the graduation exam, and the rest of the students had already left school to participate in production. At the same time, there are still quite a few school-age children in the village who have not gone to school. This shows that not enough attention is paid to cultural education and should be corrected in time. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third and Fifth Detachments of the Eastern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column set up a Lu Xun Academy in the ancestral hall of this mountain village, which was presided over by comrades such as Huang Yuan and Lou Shiyi. Unfortunately, this atmosphere of emphasizing cultural education has not been passed down. Now there is only an empty ancestral hall left, which makes people feel a little emotional.

　　The cooperative has seven full-time accountants and six full-time cadres. It seems that there are a total of thirteen people off production, which is a bit too many. The cooperative members quoted a folk song, stating that it was made by people in another mountain village, but it can also be seen their intention.

　　Listen to the report,
　　Brain imprinted;
　　Sleep on the floor,
　　Stretch lazily;
　　Work points earned.

　　This describes the cooperative cadres going to the county town to listen to the report. Because there are many people, they sleep on the floor of the venue at night, and when they get up, they stretch and earn work points in the cooperative. In fact, the report should be listened to, but the cooperative members are somewhat dissatisfied with the cooperative cadres not working, and use this to express their intentions. I feel that the Party Central Committee's rectification call for party member cadres to participate in labor is very good. When I went to the Hushanci County Party Committee, I heard that the county party secretary was transplanting rice seedlings in the field. When I was in the Yuyao People's Committee, I heard that the county chief was digging a mud pond. When I was in Lubu, I saw the district party secretary coming back from the field with muddy legs. This makes me very happy, and I feel that this new atmosphere will greatly change the style of cooperative cadres not participating in labor.

　　四明山区速写
　　——浙东记行
　　艾芜
    两边层层叠叠的山峰，密布着绿树和翠竹，显得非常的秀丽。中间一条窄狭的平地，满是苍翠的竹林，长着许多棕色的笋子，标志出山间林业的丰盛。偶然也有一片绿色的洋芋地、花生地，和着晴美的阳光，明朗开阔地现了出来。小河在竹林中流过，清亮得可以看见河底的石头，有些地方水又碰在河里的石上发出声响，溅起白色璀灿的水花。平坦的大路，就是一直沿着小河的，有时通过河上的小桥，直到河的左岸，有时又到了右岸。两山之间的窄狭平地，弯弯曲曲的。我们走在路上的时候，常常向前望去，总是绿树翠竹的峰峦，没有去路，回头来看，又不见来路了，也是一片山峰树林，仿佛老是被山和竹树包围着似的。这是浙江余姚县所属的四明山区。山区里静极了，除了小河偶然响起水声而外，常有鸟声清脆地叫着“儿——桂姐儿”。
    四明山区过去有一首民谣：“四明山，山里山，湾里湾，山里强盗交交关。”这描写了山区的形势，也说明了以往不安的环境。凭我的直觉来说，这里的确好藏强盗。山深林密，周围十几步内，你就摸不清躲有什么东西。1939年，抗日战争期间，就有共产党员来在山区里工作。1941年正式组织游击队称浙东游击纵队三四五支队（老百姓简称三五支队），使周围五六百里的四明山区，成为浙东抗日的坚强根据地。1945年浙东游击纵队全部北撤到山东，同新四军主力会合。另外一些党员留下来，看见国民党日益反动，又重新发展游击队，直到解放。四明山区自从有了游击队后，就改变了以往的情形，强盗绝了迹，成为光荣的革命根据地了。我进入四明山区这一天，看见路上走着不少的人，有的挑着春笋，有的挑着编好的竹器，有的用铁轮车运着长长的竹子，送到陆埠去卖。陆埠是一个四山环绕，小河流过的镇市，有汽车和木船直通余姚县城。我在镇上住过一夜，了解到山区人民的生活，都有了大大的改变。镇上有很大的百货商店和供销合作社。竹器茶叶土产品等等收购站，到处都是。这就可以看出人民生活的兴盛和事业的繁荣。
    约莫走到十点钟的光景，看见两处路边的竹子上，都挂有几把雨伞，还套有蓝色的布套，显得雨伞主人对雨伞的重视和爱护。可是就没有人在，附近也没有人家，只是一片山和竹林。这很使我奇异，向路人问个明白，才知道是山岙里的人，挑东西到陆埠去卖，一早起来，原是带着伞的，看见天越走越晴，觉得带伞反是一个累赘，就挂在路边竹子上，让东西挑到陆埠卖了之后，空身转回来时，再行取去。这么一说之后，使我更为惊异，一个在过去“强盗交交关”的地方，竟然出现无人看管的寄放处，真是世界上少有的事情！
    正午到一个叫杜徐的山村。依山沿溪，密排着许多房屋，约有三里路长。住四百四十六户，人口两千四百多人。村屋后面，壁立着长满毛竹和松树的山峰，村屋前面，流过一条小溪，溪水碰在巨石上面，发出哗哗的声响。山溪那面又是壁立长满竹林的山峰，使得整个山村，即正在南方正午的强烈阳光下面，也显得绿荫森森，分外清凉。这里没有什么田地，居民靠山林生活。在他们谈话中，说自己是山民，表示和农民有所区别。这从他们合作社的名字“南山篾簟合作社”也可以看出。整个山村的人，都在编篾簟，这是供应农民用来晒粮食，供应城市用来搭凉篷。同时也和别处的山村分工，别的山村有专做竹椅子的，有专编竹篮子的，这里就专编篾簟。解放前，在淡季的时候，每张篾簟卖的钱，可买十斤米，有时只能买六斤米；旺季的时候，可买五十斤谷子。现在自从组织了合作社，大批卖与国家组织的收购站，就没有淡季旺季的分别，经常每张篾簟卖的钱，能买五十五斤谷子。社员一个劳动日，可以得一元九角四分。而且一个社员只要勤快，保证一天做得到一个劳动日。
    在这个山村里，还有一种特殊的情形，就是因为没有地主，只有富农中农和贫雇农，便不曾进行过土改。组织合作社的时候，有竹林的人，将竹子作为资本投入社内。砍一百斤竹子编为篾簟，所卖的钱，从其中抽出三角五分，作为竹林所有者的报酬。但这只是限入社前生长的竹子，入社后新生的竹子，因由社施肥培植过，便归社集体所有，社员不再从竹林得到另外的利益。由于社内培植竹林极有成绩，中农都很满意。贫雇农，亦即是单纯靠手工生活的人，先前要买竹子来编篾簟，或者帮人编篾簟赚工资，常常有买不到竹子或者失业的痛苦，现在都在生活上有了保障，且不会遭到剥削，他们对社爱护，并热忱地保护山林。合作社为培植竹林，不乱砍伐，还常常到别处去买竹子来做篾簟，同时也是社员工作热情提高，大量地需要竹子来加工。解放前，杜徐岙还有把原材料运出去卖的情形，现在却是只卖手工业品了。山村里流行一首歌谣，最能表现他们现在的生活。
    杜徐岙人阿福头：
    洪山毛竹背到脚膝头；
    阿协家里开医院；
    广生堂里开银楼；
    酱油麻油设在庙里头；
    雪白的衬衫翻领头。
    青年后生出风头，
    钢笔插在胸口头。
    前一句歌，是讲现在杜徐岙人有福气了。以下便讲有福气的情形。第二句是讲外面洪山的毛竹，运到杜徐岙来，让杜徐岙人放在脚膝上编造篾簟。第三句是讲有个社员阿协家里设有联合诊疗所。第四句是讲村里的药铺广生堂设有信贷合作社。第五句是讲庙内设有供销合作社，在卖酱油麻油等等日常用品。第六句是讲人民穿的新式衣服。这都是山村里先前没有的情形，现在有了，因而感到幸福。最后两句，则是表现青年人的生活的，又愉快，又神气。
    当我进村的时候，首先使我惊异的，就是不少人家，正在新造楼房，石砌的墙壁，粗大的木梁和坚实的楼板给人一种生活富裕的强烈印象。现在社里平均每户存款可买一千斤谷子。社里公积金，以一年零二月来算已有二万八千元。晚上借宿在社员家里，盖的被面全是绸的。
    这个山村里的人，是热爱劳动的，这非常地好。只是过早地叫孩子参加手工业工作，却有点不大对。像村里的中心小学，今年高级班毕业的时候，只剩下十二个学生在准备毕业考试，其余的学生早就离开了学校，参加生产了。同时村里学龄儿童，没有上学的，还相当的多。这是表明对文化教育不甚注意，应该及时纠正。在抗日战争中，浙东游击纵队三五支队，曾在这个山村的祠堂里，设过一个鲁迅学院，由黄源、楼适夷等同志主持。不幸这一注重文化教育的风气，没有遗留下来，现在只剩下一个空空的祠堂，令人看了，不免有些感慨。
    社里有七个脱产的会计，有六个脱产的干部，看来脱产的人共十三个，是太多一些。社员引出一首歌谣，声明是别个山村的人做的，但也可以看见他们的心意。
    报告听听，
    脑子印进；
    地板困困，
    懒腰伸伸；
    工分赚进。
    这是形容社干到县城去听报告，因人多，晚间就在会场的地板上睡觉，起来时伸伸懒腰，便在合作社里，得了工分。其实报告是应该听的，只是社员对社干不劳动有些不满，借此表现他们的心意罢了。我感到党中央整风号召，要党员干部参加劳动，非常地好。我到浒山慈溪县委会的时候，听见县委书记下田插秧，在余姚人民委员会的时候，听见县长去挖泥塘。在陆埠的时候，看见区委书记满腿稀泥从田里回来。这都使我非常高兴，觉得这一新的风气，是会大大改变社干不参加劳动的作风的。
