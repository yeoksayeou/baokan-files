　　Centenarian (Traditional Chinese Painting)
    I don’t know exactly how old this centenarian from Georgia is. Originally, we agreed that I would go to his home to paint his portrait; at the last minute, he insisted on coming himself. So I waited by the window. At the appointed time, I saw several young people accompanying an old man with silver beard, striding up the steps of the hotel. I wondered, could it be him? Just as I was preparing my painting tools, someone knocked on the door. It was indeed him. I was staying on the fourth floor of the hotel, which is equivalent to the seventh or eighth floor in our China. This centenarian ran all the way up in one breath.

　　百岁老人（国画）
    这位格鲁吉亚的百岁老人究竟多少岁，我不知道。原先说好，我到他家里去为他写像；临时他坚持要自己来。我就伏在窗口上等候。到了约定的时间，见几位青年随一位银髯老者，健步走上旅馆的台阶。我寻思道，莫非就是他么？正要准备画具，有人叩门。进来的果然是他。我住在旅馆的第四层楼，那高度可相当于我们中国的七八层，这位百岁老人就这末一口气跑上楼来的。
