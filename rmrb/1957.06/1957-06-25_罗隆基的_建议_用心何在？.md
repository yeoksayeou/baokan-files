What is the Purpose of Luo Longji's "Suggestion"?
　　Tai Shuangqiu, Professor, Beijing Normal University
    In the nationwide rectification campaign, some absurd remarks have emerged, attempting to weaken the leadership of the Communist Party, undermine the Party's prestige among the masses, and thus affect the cause of socialist construction. Among these remarks, Luo Longji's suggestion at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee is a prominent example.
    Luo Longji said, "I think the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference can set up a committee with members from the Communist Party, democratic parties, and other relevant parties to review the deviations in the past 'Three-Anti,' 'Five-Anti,' and 'Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries' campaigns, and encourage those who were struggled against to 'appeal' to this committee." Luo Longji's intention is obviously to have them come out and "accuse" the Communist Party, so that this committee designed by Luo Longji can "redress their grievances." This committee is like a special court, with the Communist Party on trial, and Luo Longji wants to be praised as a "Bao Gong" who "avenges" those who were struggled against. Aside from inciting the emotions of those who were struggled against to hate the Communist Party, I see no other significance to Luo Longji's absurd suggestion.
    Luo Longji said, "Past movements all had rehabilitation work. However, the past rehabilitation work was often that the National People's Congress passed opinions to the local authorities, and the local authorities passed the opinions to the relevant units leading the movement for handling. This makes it difficult to correct mistakes." I believe that Luo Longji's statement is not in accordance with the facts. As far as I know, the Party has already done a lot of work on correcting mistakes. Taking Beijing Normal University as an example, for those who were wrongly struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Party Committee Secretary repeatedly apologized publicly on behalf of the Party at university-wide conferences, and gathered those who originally participated in the struggle in various departments to apologize to those who were wrongly struggled against, remove their labels as counter-revolutionaries, and restore their reputations. Although the Party has not yet had time to publicly apologize or give appropriate treatment to some people who were wrongly struggled against or suffered harm in ideological examinations, the Party has always stood on a fair position to handle this matter. What has not been done or has not been done well is not irreparable. This is the case at Beijing Normal University, and I think it is the same in other units. Luo Longji should know this. If Luo Longji does not agree to hand over the work of correcting mistakes to the organizations leading the movement in the relevant units, then why doesn't he propose to hand over this work to the higher-level organization leading the movement, but insists on setting up another institution with non-Party members to handle it?
    Luo Longji emphasized: "The establishment of this committee can separate the rehabilitation from the institutions of the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries. The past movement was led by the Communist Party, and today the rehabilitation is participated in by people from various parties, which is conducive to the rehabilitation work." Luo Longji meant that if the Communist Party led the rehabilitation work, it would be detrimental to the rehabilitation. This statement is fundamentally distrustful of the leadership of the Communist Party, that is, denying or at least weakening the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Luo Longji, as one of the vice chairmen of the China Democratic League, has made such absurd remarks denying the fact that the Party has already done a lot of work in rehabilitating and correcting mistakes, and has such an attempt to distrust the leadership of the Communist Party and thus weaken the leadership of the Communist Party. This trick of undermining the Communist Party's prestige among the masses and establishing his own prestige among the masses has developed to an intolerable degree. With indignant feelings, and as a member of the Democratic League, I declare that I will draw a clear ideological line with Luo Longji, and suggest that the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League launch criticism of the absurd thoughts and remarks of Luo Longji and others.

　　罗隆基的“建议”用心何在？
　　北京师范大学教授　邰爽秋
    在全国整风声中出现了一些荒谬言论，企图削弱共产党的领导，破坏党在群众中的威信，从而影响社会主义建设的事业。在这些言论中，罗隆基在中共中央统战部座谈会上的建议是一个突出的例子。
    罗隆基说，我觉得人民代表大会和全国政协可以成立一个有共产党、民主党派成员和其他有关方面人士参加的委员会，以检查过去“三反”、“五反”和“肃反”工作中的偏差，并鼓励被斗争的人都向这个委员会“申诉”。罗隆基的用意显然是要他们出来“控告”共产党，以便由罗隆基所设计的这个委员会为他们“伸诉冤枉”。这个委员会仿佛是一个特殊的法庭，受审的则是共产党，而罗隆基却要被歌颂成为替那些被斗争的人“报仇”的“包大人”。罗隆基的这种荒谬建议的主要作用，除了引起被斗争的人仇恨共产党的情绪之外，我看不出有其他的意义。
    罗隆基说，“过去运动都有平反工作。不过过去的平反工作，往往是人民代表大会把意见转给地方，地方又将意见转给有关单位领导运动的组织去处理，这样就很难做到有错必纠”。我认为，罗隆基的这番话不符合事实，就我所知道的，党对纠错工作已经做了不少工作。即以北京师范大学而论，对于在肃反中被斗错了的人，党委书记一再在全校性的大会上代表党公开道歉，并且在各系中召集过原来参加斗争的人向被斗错的人道歉，替他们摘去反革命的帽子，恢复他们的名誉。党对于某些被斗错或是在思想检查中受了伤害的人虽说还没有来得及公开道歉或是给以恰当的处理，但是，党始终是站在公正的立场来处理这件事的，对于尚未做到或是做得不够的地方，不是不可弥补的。师大如此，别的单位想来也是这样，罗隆基不应该不知道的。罗隆基如果不赞成把纠错的工作交给有关单位领导运动的组织去处理，那末他何以不提议把这工作交给领导运动组织的上一级组织去处理而偏偏要另外搞一套有党外人士参加的机构来处理呢？
    罗隆基强调说：“成立这个委员会可以将平反和三反、五反及肃反的机构划分开来，过去的运动是共产党领导的，今天平反有各党派人士参加，那就有利于做平反工作。”罗隆基的意思是说，如果由共产党领导来做平反工作，就会于平反不利。这种说法是根本不信任共产党领导，也就是否认或至少是削弱共产党的领导。
    罗隆基身为民盟副主席之一，竟发出这种否认党在平反纠错工作中已经做了不少工作的胡言，有这种不信任共产党领导从而削弱共产党领导的企图，这种破坏共产党在群众中威信并为自己在群众中建立威信的诡计，已经发展到令人不能容忍的地步。我以愤慨的心情，以盟员身份，宣布同罗隆基划清思想界限，并建议民盟中央和北京市委员会，对罗隆基等人的荒谬思想和言论展开批判。
