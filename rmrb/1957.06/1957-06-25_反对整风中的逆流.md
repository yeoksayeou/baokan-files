　　Countercurrents in the Rectification Campaign
　　Zheng Xin, Professor of Peking University

　　Since the start of the rectification campaign, non-Party members have offered opinions to Party organizations and the Party members in their units. The vast majority of these are sincere and well-intentioned. Because the Communist Party is the leading party, it is connected to China's destiny; and the Party's policies are implemented through its members. If Party members' ideology and work style have even a little fewer problems, the work will be that much smoother and the people will benefit that much more; if Party members' ideology and work style have even a little more problems, the work will take more detours and the people will suffer that much more. Only from the perspective of loving the Party and loving the people's cause can we truly "know everything and say everything." From what I have observed, some Party members who originally had some problems have already begun to improve in their work style, and will improve even more in the future; and those who offer opinions have also improved themselves in the process of helping the Party rectify. This method of criticism and self-criticism is the only correct method for resolving contradictions among the people. The Communist Party dares to conduct an open-door rectification campaign nationwide, to face its own shortcomings and errors squarely, and also has the determination to overcome its shortcomings and errors, in order to serve the people better. This commitment to the people and to the socialist cause is the highest expression of human morality. Therefore, the broad masses of non-Party members are also happy to help the Party rectify.

　　However, in the rectification campaign, a wrong trend has emerged—a wrong trend that attempts to abolish the Party's leadership and does not want to take the socialist road. This wrong trend fills me with hatred. I was long prepared to shout at these people, "Strike a blow with the spear." The People's Daily's righteous and stern editorials in recent days have given me a sense of relief. In these days, I have been thinking about many questions, such as the issue of the Party's leadership (including the Party committee system in universities), why the Party's leadership should only be strengthened and not weakened, how to improve the quality of political and ideological education in universities, why Marxism is the truth and must be studied, why dialectical materialism is the final philosophical system of mankind, and so on. These questions are urgent questions that need to be answered for the broad masses of intellectuals and young students. Each of us in the philosophical community should seriously consider these questions and provide our own possible answers. In this way, we will both help others and educate ourselves. It is wrong to be indifferent to these serious questions or to take a detached attitude.

　　This article only wants to talk about the countercurrents or wrong trends in the rectification campaign.

　　This countercurrent comes from all directions; it manifests itself in various forms; and the object of its attack is the Party's leadership.

　　One of its manifestations is to attack the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and the "Purge of Counterrevolutionaries" movement, which were necessary for the people's democratic dictatorship and the establishment of revolutionary order, by using bourgeois legal viewpoints, calling them "illegal." They shout for "establishing a legal system" and "strictly enforcing the rule of law." Based on this kind of "rule of law" thinking, Luo Longji demanded the establishment of a self-contained "Rehabilitation Committee" and advocated a "bicameral system." Wang Zaoshi slandered the Party for "emphasizing rule by people and de-emphasizing the rule of law," saying that American democracy is hypocritical, but the rule of law is serious, and so on. Luo Longji, Wang Zaoshi and others once used "rule of law" to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. Today, they propose "rule of law" to "cure" and "remedy" the people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party. They want to equate the people's democratic dictatorship with Chiang Kai-shek's regime!

　　The first "ideological trend" is to oppose democratic centralism with bourgeois democracy. For example, the clamor for "professors running the university," "democratic administration of the university," and "Party committees withdrawing from the university" in universities reflects this kind of thinking. They say: The reason why the university Party committee does not lead university education well is because it is "laymen leading experts." Is it really "laymen leading experts"? That is not the case. In the university, the Party committee, the principals office secretaries, the deputy department heads, the assistant department heads, the department secretaries, etc., are rarely not university graduates; most of those who work in the department are graduates of the department, so it cannot be said that they are "laymen." In addition, they are the "best" Party members in this department in terms of professional and political aspects. We have no reason to call them "laymen"; the so-called "laymen leading experts" is just an excuse to abolish or weaken the leadership of the Party committee. There are quite a few contradictions in the university. If you want to correctly handle these contradictions, it is impossible without the leadership of the Party; any attempt to weaken the leadership of the Party committee is wrong; the problem lies in how to strengthen the leadership of the Party committee. (Here I want to protest the Guangming Daily's report on June 2, "Fudan University Abolishes the Party Committee Responsibility System"; it reported it unfaithfully and did not correct it seriously, and the editorial department should be held responsible.) In our Party organization and its members, "three evils" exist to varying degrees. For example, subjectivism is quite common among young Party members. As long as the "three evils" are gradually eradicated, the relationship between the Party and the masses can be improved, and the work can be carried out better; it is definitely not a question of whether the Party committee system should exist or be abolished. All revisionist slogans such as "professors running the university," "democratic administration of the university," and even "Party committees get out of the university" will not find a market in the school.

　　Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping and other bourgeois rightists are attacking the Party politically and organizationally. Chu Anping found the root of the Party's sectarianism in "the Party's world"; he advised the Party to overcome its own sectarianism by giving up its leadership. It is noteworthy that the comrades of the China Democratic League exposed that "there are people behind" him. Now the clues are clear, Zhang Bojun's "political design institute" and Chu Anping's "the Party's world" echo each other. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and others are obsessed with the "bicameral system" in Western capitalist countries. They want to expand their ranks and turn the CPPCC into an "upper house" to control the "lower house." The CPPCC is an institution for internal consultation among the people based on the interests of the people, and is not an institution used to control the highest organ of power—the National People's Congress. They want to use these kinds of "legal" means to allocate power. Why are they not satisfied with the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" towards the democratic parties? Because the democratic parties must recognize the Party's leadership (which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution), which makes them uncomfortable, because their purpose is to seize power and "take turns governing." They are too imaginative. They do not know the position of the Communist Party in the hearts of 600 million people, especially in the hearts of workers, peasants and progressive intellectuals, who are willing to defend the Chinese Communist Party that liberated them with their blood. Without the Communist Party, socialism cannot be built. Any other party can only follow the Communist Party to engage in socialism, and it is impossible to engage in socialism alone. This is common political sense. Why are Zhang, Luo and others confused? This has their class roots. Although the foundation of the bourgeoisie has been hollowed out, the consciousness of the bourgeoisie's spokespersons still stubbornly manifests itself on various fronts; the organized activities of Zhang, Luo and others are not accidental. In addition, these people have really been confused by the united front work in recent years. Not long after liberation, at a meeting of the Federation of Social Sciences Societies, I raised the opinion about "unlimited united front" to Elder Lin (Boqu). I also felt that the Party took care of the democratic personages more than educated them, and recruited more than supervised them.

　　One of the strategies of the bourgeois rightists to undermine the relationship between the Party and the masses is to clamor that there is a "deep ditch" and a "thick wall" between the Party and the masses, and that the deep ditch and thick wall are all created by the Communist Party alone. Therefore, it is not allowed to suggest that the Party and the masses work together to dismantle the wall and fill the ditch. In this regard, Zhang Yunchuan has made no small contribution. I would like to talk about this person, Zhang Yunchuan. I have met Zhang three times. The first time was in Kunming, around the time of the "New Fourth Army Incident." At that time, he was an admirer of Mr. Liang Shuming. He talked about how the village governance faction's route and the Communist Party's route were different; only by implementing village governance could China be saved. I disagreed with his statement. I said that the revolutionary movement carried out by the Communist Party was China's only way out, and we people were just running errands; of course, he also disagreed. The second time was in Beijing not long after liberation. He came to my house to see me. At that time, it seemed that he had not yet received good care, and he complained a lot. The third time was at the evening party welcoming President Ho Chi Minh. At that time, the criticism of Liang Shuming's thought was being carried out. I said: You know Mr. Liang Shuming's thoughts the most deeply, so you should criticize them. He said that he had never read Liang's book! I was shocked and retreated at that time. Today, Zhang is still talking about how thick the wall is and how deep the ditch is between the Party and the masses, and that it was all created by the Party alone. I know that his thinking has not changed much from fifteen or sixteen years ago. Therefore, I feel that ideological remolding is a difficult matter and an urgent need. Since there are thick walls and deep ditches between the Party and the masses, and the Communist Party has no sincerity in unilaterally removing the walls and filling the ditches, the logical conclusion drawn from this accusation should be: you should step aside.

　　Another strategy of the bourgeois rightists is to insult those who are close to the Party, such as "aiding and abetting the tyrant," "shameless," etc., in an attempt to make people afraid to approach the Party. They are wrong. Those who recognize the truth do not even distinguish between honor and disgrace because they are scolded. I think the Chiang Kai-shek faction's newspapers would scold even more fiercely, even threatening to "execute them according to the law" when "the royal army recovers the Central Plains." Should we be afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's "execution according to the law"? Insulting, writing threatening letters, and throwing bombs are essentially working for Chiang Kai-shek; insulting is one method, and writing threatening letters and throwing bombs are another method. The latter action only proves that there are indeed hidden counterrevolutionaries among the people.

　　Whether it is from the perspective of bourgeois legal studies, from the perspective of "academic independence," "professors running the university," "democratic administration of the university," etc., from the perspective of bourgeois democracy and freedom, or from the "wall-and-ditch theory" between the Party and the masses, or from not allowing people to say that "achievements are the main thing," although the nature is not completely the same, they all boil down to attacking the Party's leadership. Their words and deeds are not isolated from each other, but echo each other, and are reflected in the minds of four hundredths of the university students (there are about 20 people in 8,000 students at Peking University who have serious bourgeois rightist thoughts); the words and deeds of four hundredths of the university students, in turn, serve as a foil for the "theories" of the bourgeois rightists. The poisonous influence of their words is far-reaching. Today (June 15), the People's Daily reprinted the articles and speeches of lecturer Wang Zunyi of Shaanxi Normal College and lecturer Dong Shiguang of Southwest Normal College as examples. Wang and Dong belong to the Ge Peiqi category, and they openly insult the Party; this is not adopted by seasoned politicians such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi.

　　This is the countercurrent in the Party's rectification campaign that I am talking about.

　　The objective existence of this countercurrent, and its objective existence within the intellectuals (members of democratic parties are part of the intellectuals), presents us with the serious task of studying Marxism and transforming old ideas.

### 反对整风中的逆流

　　反对整风中的逆流
　　北京大学教授　郑昕
    整风运动开始以来，党外人士给党组织和所在单位的党员提意见，其中绝大部分是诚恳的，是与人为善的。因为共产党是领导党，它关系着中国的命运；而党的方针政策，是通过党员来实现的。党员的思想作风少一分毛病，工作便多一分顺利，人民便多得一分好处；党员的思想作风多一分毛病，工作便多走些弯路，人民便多受一分害处。从爱护党，爱护人民事业的心情出发，我们才能做到“知无不言，言无不尽”。就我所接触到的原来有些毛病的党员，在作风上已开始好转，将来更会好转；而提意见的人在帮助党整风的过程中也提高了自己。这种批评和自我批评的方法，是解决人民内部矛盾唯一的正确方法。共产党敢于在全国范围内开门整风，正视自己的缺点和错误，也有决心克服自己的缺点和错误，为着更好地为人民服务。这种忠于人民，忠于社会主义的事业的决心，是人类最高的道德表现。所以广大党外人士，也乐于帮助党整风。
    但是在整风运动中出现了歪风，——企图取消党的领导，不想走社会主义道路的歪风。这股歪风使我憎恨。我早已准备向这些人大喝一声，“投戈一击”。这几天来人民日报的义正词严的社论，使我松了一口气。我在这些日子里想了许多问题，像党的领导权问题（包含大学中党委制问题），为什么党的领导只许加强，不许削弱？大学中政治思想教育如何提高质量问题？马克思主义为什么是真理，必须学习？辩证唯物主义为什么是人类最后的一个哲学体系？等等。这些问题，对广大知识分子和青年学生都是迫切需要回答的问题。我们哲学界每个人都应该严肃地考虑这些问题，作出自己可能作出的解答，这样，既帮助了别人，也教育了自己；对这些严重的问题而无动于衷或持事不关己的态度，是错误的。
    本文只想谈谈整风运动中的逆流或歪风。
    这股逆流是来自四面八方；它表现的形式是各色各样的；它所冲击的对象是党的领导权。
    它的表现形式之一是通过资产阶级的法学观点来抨击为人民民主专政和建立革命秩序所必需的“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”运动，把它们说成是“不合法”的。他们高呼“建立法制”，“厉行法治”。罗隆基便在这样的“法治”的思想基础上要求成立一个自成系统的“平反委员会”和提倡“两院制”。王造时诬蔑党“轻法治重人治”，他说美国的民主是虚伪的，但是法治是认真的等等。罗隆基、王造时等人曾经用过“法治”反对蒋介石的独裁，今天提出“法治”来“医治”、“补救”共产党所领导的人民民主专政，他们想将人民民主专政和蒋介石政权说成一样的东西！
    第一个“思潮”是用资产阶级的民主来反对民主集中制。譬如在大学中的“教授治校”，“民主办校”，“党委退出学校”的叫嚣，就反映这种思想。他们说：学校党委之所以领导不好大学教育，因为是“外行管内行”。真的“外行管内行”么？不是事实。学校里党委，校长室秘书，副系主任，助理系主任，系秘书等，很少不是大学毕业的；在系里工作的多半是本系毕业的，这就不能说是“外行”。此外，他们在业务和政治方面都是这个部门的党员中“拔尖儿的”，我们没有理由把他们说成“外行”；所谓“外行管内行”不过是取消或削弱党委领导的借口而已。大学里的矛盾是相当的多的，想正确地处理这些矛盾，不可能没有党的领导；任何削弱党委领导的企图都是错误的；问题在于如何加强党委的领导。（在这里我要抗议光明日报6月2日“复旦大学取消党委负责制”的报道；不忠实地报道了，又不郑重地更正，编辑部应负责任。）在我们的党组织和它的成员中，“三害”是在不同的程度上存在着，譬如在年青的党员中主观主义便相当的普遍。只要逐步地铲除“三害”就能改善党群关系，工作就能更好的展开；而决不是党委制的存废问题。一切“教授治校”，“民主办校”直到“党委从学校里滚出去”等等修正主义的口号，在学校中是找不到市场的。
    章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平等等资产阶级右派分子是从政治上和组织上向党进攻。储安平在“党天下”中找到了党的宗派主义的根源；他规劝党用放弃领导权的办法去克服它自己的宗派主义。可注意的是民盟的同志们揭穿了他“背后有人”。现在线索已清楚了，章伯钧的“政治设计院”和储安平的“党天下”是相呼应的。章伯钧、罗隆基等人迷恋西方资本主义国家的“两院制”，想扩大他们的队伍，将政协搞成“上议院”来控制“下议院”。政协是从人民的利益出发的人民内部协商的机构，并不是用作控制最高权力机关——人民代表大会的机构。他们想运用这类“合法”的手段来配备力量。他们为什么不满足于党对各民主党派的“长期共存，互相监督”的方针呢？因为各民主党派要承认党的领导（这是宪法中明文规定的），这使他们不舒服，因为他们的目的是：夺取政权，“轮流执政”。他们未免太富于幻想了。他们不知道共产党在六亿人的心目中的地位，特别是在工人、农民和进步的知识分子心目中的地位，这些人是愿意拿鲜血来捍卫解放了他们的中国共产党的。没有共产党就建不成社会主义，任何其他的党只能跟着共产党搞社会主义，而不可能单独地搞社会主义，这是政治常识，章、罗等人为什么搞糊涂了呢？这是有他们的阶级根源的，尽管资产阶级的墙脚已被挖空了，而资产阶级代言人的意识仍然顽强地在各个战线上表现自己；章、罗等等有组织的活动，并不是偶然的。此外，这些年来这些人也真的被统战统昏了。解放后不久在一次社联会议上，我对林老（伯渠）提过关于“统战无边”的意见。我还觉得党对民主人士照顾多于教育，网罗多于监督。
    资产阶级右派分子破坏党群关系策略之一，是叫嚣党群之间有“深沟”和“厚墙”，并且深沟厚墙都是共产党一手造成的，所以不许提党群一齐动手拆墙填沟。在这方面张云川是出力不小的。我愿意说说张云川这个人。我和张有三面之雅。第一次在昆明，“新四军事变”前后，他当时是梁漱溟先生的崇拜者，他谈村治派路线和共产党路线如何不同；只有实行村治才可以救中国。我不同意他的说法，我说共产党所搞的革命运动，是中国唯一的出路，我们这些人只是跑跑龙套而已；当然他也不同意。第二次解放后不久在北京，他到我家看我。当时他好像还没有得到很好的照顾，怨言颇多。第三次是欢迎胡志明主席的晚会上，当时正对梁漱溟思想进行批判。我说：你知道梁漱溟先生思想最深，应该批评批评。他说，他从未读过梁的书！我当时愕然而退。今天张之斤斤乐道党群之间墙之厚，沟之深，并且还是党一手造成云云，我就知道他的思想和十五、六年前并没有多大的改变。我因此感到思想改造是一件难事而又是迫切需要的。党群之间既有厚墙、深沟，而且又是共产党一手造成的，而共产党又没有单方撤墙平沟的诚意，从这条罪状得出逻辑的结论应该是：还是你们退避贤路吧。
    资产阶级右派人另一策略是辱骂靠拢党的人，像“为虎作伥”“无耻之尤”之类，企图使人以接近党为畏途。他们想错了。认识真理的人并不因为他们一骂，连荣与辱也分不清了。我想蒋介石派报纸的骂法还会激烈得多，甚至于以“王师恢复中原日”要“明正典刑”来威胁，难道我们就应该怕蒋介石的“明正典刑”？辱骂，写恫吓信，掷炸弹，实质上就是在替蒋介石做工作；辱骂是一种办法，写恫吓信，掷炸弹，是另一种办法，后一种举动不过证明人民内部的确还有暗藏的反革命分子而已。
    不管从资产阶级法学观点也好，从“学术独立”，“教授治校”“民主办校”等等观点也好，从资产阶级民主、自由观点也好，从党群之间的“墙沟论”也好，从不许讲“成绩是主要的”也好，虽然性质上不全相同，而都归结为向党的领导权开刀。他们的言论和行动不是彼此孤立的，而是互相映照，并且反映到四百分之一（北大八千学生中有严重资产阶级右派思想的有二十人上下）的大学生头脑中来；四百分之一的大学生的言论与行动，又反过来为资产阶级右派的“理论”作衬托。他们言论的流毒是深远的，今天（6月15日）人民日报转载陕西师范学院王尊一讲师和西南师范学院讲师董时光的文章和发言便是例证。王、董属于葛佩琦一类，他们公开地辱骂党；这是章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等老练的政客们所不取的。
    这就是我所说的党的整风运动中的逆流。
    这个逆流是客观地存在着，而且在知识分子（民主党派的成员是知识分子的一部分）内部客观地存在着，这件事实，就向我们提出学习马克思主义和改造旧思想的严重任务。
