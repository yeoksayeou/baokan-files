　　How to Unite the Upper-Middle Peasants in Agricultural Cooperatives
　　——An Investigation of the Middle Peasant Problem in Five Cooperatives in the "Mintian Area" of Zhongshan County
　　Feng Ping
　　Not long ago, I and some comrades went to the first cooperative of Shangshan Township, the Wanqiang Cooperative, the Nongqin Cooperative, the Dahuan Township Cooperative, and the Zhuxi Cooperative in the "Mintian Area" (note) of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, to conduct an investigation on the issue of cooperatives uniting middle peasants (mainly upper-middle peasants) and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.
　　Judging from the situation of these cooperatives, middle peasants generally account for about one-third of the total number of peasant households, of which new upper-middle peasants account for about one-fifth to one-quarter of their stratum, that is, 7%-8% of the total number of households.
　　After most of the upper-middle peasants joined the agricultural cooperatives, the distribution results in the first year showed a decrease in income compared with the time of individual economy (1955), while a small number of upper-middle peasants with particularly strong labor power increased their income. In the Dahuan Cooperative, among the thirty-one upper-middle peasant households, fourteen had relatively strong labor power. In general, their income decreased by 10%-20%. Nine households with ordinary labor power generally saw their income decrease by 20%-30%. Eight households with weak labor power generally saw their income decrease by 30%-40%, with individual households seeing their income decrease by more than 50%.
　　There are various reasons why the income of upper-middle peasants decreased after joining the cooperatives.
　　There are various reasons why the income of upper-middle peasants decreased after joining the cooperatives. The main ones are as follows:
　　First, the cooperatives did not correctly implement the policy of comprehensively developing production. In the past, rice generally accounted for only about 50% of the income of farmers in these cooperatives, horticultural crops (what local farmers call "mountain gardens," planting melons, beans, potatoes, taro, etc.) accounted for 25%-30%, and animal husbandry (mainly raising sows, meat pigs, ducks, and vegetable ducks, etc.) accounted for 20%-25%. In 1956, the cooperatives only focused on increasing rice production, neglecting the production of horticultural crops and animal husbandry. As a result, grain production increased (which was completely correct), but the income of the members decreased. In the past, upper-middle peasants had a large proportion of income from horticultural crops and animal husbandry, so their income decreased even more.
　　Second, upper-middle peasants possessed superior means of production, which was the decisive factor guaranteeing their income in the past. For example, in the Dahuan Cooperative, poor peasants had an average of 1.08 mu of land per person, while upper-middle peasants had an average of 1.9 mu per person. If the yield of each mu of land for upper-middle peasants is calculated at 695 jin, then each upper-middle peasant could earn more than 500 jin of rice than poor peasants (if horticultural crops or other cash crops were planted, the difference would be even greater). After joining the advanced cooperative, the remuneration for means of production (land and cattle) was abolished, and their income decreased.
　　Third, agricultural cooperatives increased production in 1956, but the production level of most cooperatives had not yet caught up with the production level of upper-middle peasants. In 1955, the average yield of rice fields per mu for upper-middle peasants in Shangshan Township was 700 jin when they worked individually, while the average yield per mu in the cooperative in 1956 was 500 jin. For horticultural crops, upper-middle peasants could earn 250 yuan per mu, while the cooperative only earned about 150 yuan. After joining the cooperative, the family sideline occupations of upper-middle peasants generally decreased compared to before.
　　Because of the decrease in income, some upper-middle peasants once expressed their desire to withdraw from the cooperative. In addition, a considerable number of poor and lower-middle peasants whose income decreased due to lack of labor power, as well as some people who had previously engaged in peddling, handicrafts, fishing, and other occupations, also wanted to withdraw from the cooperative.
　　Faced with this problem, what should be done? There are two possible policies that can be adopted: one policy is to face up to the current problems, recognize that dealing with this problem is one of the main keys to consolidating agricultural cooperatives at present, and actively and proactively take various effective measures to fundamentally solve the problem and stabilize the emotions of the upper-middle peasants, which will result in the gradual consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. The other policy is to attempt to solve the problem by administrative restrictions, which will result in the long-term accumulation of problems, only making the problems more acute and complex, and making the work passive.
　　Of course, the correct one is the first policy, not the second policy.
　　So, what is the way to unite middle peasants?
　　Strive to catch up and surpass the original production level of upper-middle peasants as soon as possible
　　Based on the specific conditions of agricultural cooperatives, tapping and leveraging all potential forces, striving to catch up and surpass the production level of upper-middle peasants in the shortest possible time, and stabilizing and increasing the income of members is the key to uniting middle peasants and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.
　　The situation in these cooperatives shows that upper-middle peasants generally occupied more and better land and cattle before joining the cooperative, had sufficient production funds, had relatively high production technology, and were relatively good at planning and management, which constituted their higher production level. In the early stage of establishing cooperatives, due to the uneven fertility of the land in the cooperative, the shortage of cattle and farm tools, and the lack of experience, it was very difficult to catch up or surpass the production level of upper-middle peasants all at once. However, as long as the superiority of the cooperative can be fully utilized and the potential for increasing production can be tapped and leveraged, the production of the cooperative can catch up with and even surpass the production level of upper-middle peasants relatively quickly. Last year, the rice production level of the Wanqiang Cooperative exceeded the level of upper-middle peasants by about 10%. The Dahuan Cooperative also approached the production level of upper-middle peasants (only 8% short). In cooperatives like these, the production enthusiasm of the members is relatively high, and the cooperative is becoming increasingly consolidated. In general cooperatives, the increase in production speed and total income will first exceed that of upper-middle peasants, then the unit area yield of certain products, and finally the unit area yield of various crops.
　　According to the requirements of the national plan and the economic characteristics of each agricultural cooperative, correctly implementing the policy of comprehensively developing production has a decisive role in improving the production level of the cooperative and the income level of the members. Cooperatives need to better develop horticultural crops and other sideline production while ensuring the completion of grain production tasks. In 1956, the first cooperative of Shangshan Township reduced about 400-500 mu of horticultural crops, reduced the amount of pig raising, and did not better organize the members to go out to sea to catch fish and shellfish, resulting in a reduction of more than 30,000-40,000 yuan in income. In the past, 70% of the members of the Wanqiang Cooperative relied on fishing and shellfish gathering as their main source of income. In 1956, the cooperative only organized 18 people to do this, resulting in a reduction of more than 10,000 yuan in income for the entire cooperative, an average reduction of more than 60 yuan per household.
　　Summarizing and absorbing the good experience of middle peasants in managing production in the past is also beneficial to improving the production of the cooperative. According to our investigation, there are at least three good experiences that can be learned from the past management of middle peasants: First, using production to support production, and using the method of accelerating capital turnover to solve the problem of production funds. In the past, many upper-middle peasants in the first cooperative of Shangshan Township planted one or two mu or more of horticultural crops, intercropping and interplanting *pork intestine beans*, *cowpeas*, bitter melon, *chayote*, taro, yam, *Sen* potatoes, cassava, sweet potatoes, vegetables, and other seven, eight, or even more than ten kinds of crops, year after year, so there was income every month. They used this income to solve the problem of funds in rice fields and sideline production. Second, the close integration of agricultural and sideline production. Many upper-middle peasants in the first cooperative of Shangshan Township raised pigs (two to four pigs per household). In addition to buying a small amount of rice bran, the problem of concentrated and coarse feed was entirely solved by agricultural production. They calculated how many pigs to raise, how much feed was needed, how much feed was needed for small pigs, medium pigs, and large pigs, and when what feed was needed, and they planted various crops according to the amount needed. The increase in fertilizer also supported agriculture. Third, the combined use of main labor and auxiliary labor is also a good experience in the production management of upper-middle peasants.
　　Giving certain considerations to upper-middle peasants while adhering to the principle of distribution according to labor.
　　Giving certain economic considerations to upper-middle peasants while adhering to the principle of distribution according to labor is an indispensable measure to consolidate the alliance between poor and middle peasants and consolidate agricultural cooperatives at present.
　　Bringing middle peasants together in cooperatives to carry out production together is ultimately for the benefit of all peasants. However, if the economic interests of middle peasants are not taken into account, the purpose of uniting production cannot be achieved. Cooperatives, based on the opinions of poor peasants, upper-middle peasants, and cooperative cadres, can take the following measures: First, without affecting the development of the collective economy, reserve about 5% of the cultivated land for members as private plots (about 0.1 to 0.12 mu per person) as a supplementary income for members. Upper-middle peasants have particularly good experience in managing horticultural crops, and managing private plots plays a big role in maintaining and increasing their income. Second, while developing sideline occupations, encourage and help members to develop household sideline production during the slack season. They should be allowed to sell their products in the free market or to supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned departments. Allow members to leave some semi-labor to engage in household sideline production. Both cooperatives and production teams should carry out short-term work arrangements and labor self-reporting methods so that members can arrange their own time and use their free time to engage in household sideline production. After completing the production tasks assigned by the cooperative, the production team can independently manage some sideline production, and the income will be distributed to the team. Third, starting from 1956, the payment for cattle and farm tools joining the cooperative should be paid off within two or three years, and should not be arbitrarily delayed. Fourth, for fruit trees, forests, etc., the method of proportional dividend distribution should be adhered to for a considerable period of time (such as three to five years); for those that have been depreciated and returned to the cooperative, the payment should be paid off on schedule. A small amount of scattered fruit trees and forests are still privately owned by the members. Fifth, provide care for members with weak labor in work arrangements.
　　According to our investigation, after taking these measures while ensuring that the cooperative increases production year by year, the problem of members with reduced income will be basically solved for about 80%.
　　To take these measures that appropriately take care of the interests of upper-middle peasants, it is first necessary to open up the thinking of cadres and party members, mobilize poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, improve their confidence in running the cooperative well, and make them all understand the significance and methods of solving the problem of members with reduced income and upper-middle peasants, and rely on them to solve this problem.
　　Strengthening political and ideological education to make peasants recognize the correct path
　　In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen political and ideological work to improve the ideological awareness of members. At present, it is necessary to focus on conducting education in three aspects: The first is education on the superiority of collectivization, pointing out that only collectivization is the correct path. The second is labor education, pointing out to those who have labor power but attend work less that only by actively participating in labor can they increase production and improve their lives. The third is to explain the purpose and benefits of opening up the free market to peasants, to draw a clear line between peasant trade and business operation, and to criticize the idea of abandoning agriculture to engage in business speculation.
　　The Dahuan Cooperative did this and achieved remarkable results, and the trend of withdrawing from the cooperative quickly subsided.
　　[Note] The "Mintian Area" in Zhongshan County is in a hilly area. Because *sand fields* were called "official fields" in the past, many farmers call the general ones "people's fields."

　　怎样团结农业社里的上中农
　　——中山县“民田地区”五个社中农问题的调查
　　冯平
    不久以前，我和一些同志到广东省中山县“民田地区”（注）的上栅乡第一社、顽强社、农勤社、大环乡社和竹溪社等五个社，对合作社团结中农（主要是上中农）和巩固农业社的问题，作了一次调查。
    从这几个社的情况看来，中农一般占总农户三分之一左右，其中新上中农约占本阶层的五分之一到四分之一，即占总户数的7％—8％。
    多数上中农参加农业社以后，第一年分配的结果，比个体经济时（1955年）的收入减少，少数劳动力特别强的上中农则增加了收入。大环社三十一户上中农，劳动力比较强的有十四户，一般情况是收入减少了10％—20％，劳动力普通的九户，收入一般减少20％—30％；劳动力弱的八户，收入一般减少30％—40％，个别户收入减少了50％以上。
    上中农入社后收入减少有多种多样的原因
    上中农入社后收入减少的原因是多种多样的，主要的有下面几个：
    一、合作社没有正确地贯彻全面发展生产的方针。这几个社农民过去的收入中，稻谷一般只占50％左右，园艺作物（当地农民叫“山园”，种植瓜、豆、薯类、芋头等等）占25％—30％，畜牧业（主要是养母猪、肉猪、母鸭、菜鸭等）占20％—25％。1956年合作社只注意了稻谷的增产，忽视了园艺作物和畜牧业的生产，结果，粮食是增产了（这是完全对的），但社员的收入却减少了。过去，上中农的园艺作物和畜牧业方面的收入比重很大，因此他们的收入也就减少得更多。
    二、上中农占有优越的生产资料，这是过去保证他们的收入的决定性因素。如大环社贫农平均每人有田一点零八亩，上中农平均每人一点九亩。上中农的田每亩产量以六百九十五斤计，则上中农每人就可能比贫农多收入五百多斤稻谷（如果种上园艺作物或其他经济作物，差额就会更大了）。参加高级社之后，取消了生产资料（土地和耕牛）的报酬，他们的收入就减少了。
    三、1956年农业社是增产的，但多数社的生产水平还没有赶上上中农的生产水平。上栅乡上中农1955年单干时平均每亩稻田产量七百斤，合作社1956年平均每亩产量五百斤。园艺作物：上中农每亩可收入二百五十元，合作社只收入一百五十元左右。大环社上中农1955年每亩稻田产量是六百九十五斤，合作社1956年每亩稻田产量是六百四十三斤。上中农入社以后，家庭副业一般比以前减少了。
    由于收入减少了，一部分上中农曾经表示要退社。此外，还有相当一部分因缺少劳动力而减收的贫农和下中农，以及一些过去从事过小贩、手工业、渔业等职业的人，也跟着要退社。
    面对着这个问题，该怎样办呢？有两个可能被采取的方针：一个方针是正视当前存在的问题，认识到处理好这个问题是当前巩固农业社的主要关键之一，积极主动地采取各种有效措施，从根本上去解决问题，稳定上中农的情绪，结果会使农业社逐步巩固。另一个方针是企图用行政限制的办法来解决问题，结果，问题被长久积累，只能使问题更加尖锐化、复杂化，使工作陷于被动。
    当然，正确的是第一个方针，而不是第二个方针。
    那么，团结中农的途径是什么呢？
    力争尽快赶上并且超过上中农原有的生产水平
    根据农业社的具体条件，挖掘和发挥一切的潜在力量，力争在最短的时间内赶上和超过上中农的生产水平，稳定和增加社员的收入，是团结中农、巩固农业社的关键。
    这几个社的情况都说明：上中农在入社前一般都占有比较多、比较好的土地、耕牛，有充分的生产资金，有比较高的生产技术，比较善于计划和经营，这些，构成了他们的较高的生产水平。合作社初办时期，由于社内土地肥瘦不一，耕牛农具不足，由于没有经验，要一下子赶上或者超过上中农的生产水平，是有很大困难的。但是，只要能够充分发挥合作社的优越性，挖掘和发挥增产潜力，合作社的生产是可以较快地赶上以至超过上中农的生产水平的。去年，顽强社稻谷生产水平就超过了上中农水平的10％左右；大环社也接近了上中农的生产水平（只差8％）。凡是这样的社，社员的生产积极性就比较高，社就日益趋向巩固。在一般合作社里，也会在增产速度和总收入方面首先超过上中农，而后在某些生产的单位面积产量方面，最后在各种作物单位面积产量方面超过上中农。
    根据国家计划的要求和各个农业社的经济特点，正确地贯彻执行全面发展生产的方针，对于提高合作社生产水平和社员的收入水平，有着决定性的作用。合作社有必要在保证完成粮食生产任务的基础上，更好地发展园艺作物和其他副业生产。上栅乡第一社1956年减少了约四、五百亩的园艺作物，减少了养猪量，没有更好地组织社员出海捕鱼捞蚬，结果，收入就减少三、四万元以上。顽强社过去有70％的社员是以捕鱼捞蚬为主要收入来源的，1956年合作社只组织了十八个人来搞，仅这一项全社就减少收入一万元以上，平均每一户减少收入六十元以上。
    总结和吸取中农过去经营生产方面好的经验，对于提高合作社的生产也有好处。根据我们调查，中农过去的经营至少有三条好的经验是可以学习的：第一，以生产养生产，用加速资金流转的办法，解决生产资金问题。上栅乡第一社有不少上中农过去就是种植一、二亩或者更多的园艺作物，先后间作、套作猪肠豆、豆角、苦瓜、节瓜、芋头、大薯、森薯、木薯、番薯、蔬菜等等七、八种甚至十多种作物，长年不断，因而月月有收入。就以这些收入，来解决稻田和副业生产中的资金问题。第二，农、副业生产密切结合。上栅乡第一社许多上中农养猪（一户养猪二头到四头），除了买很少量的米糠外，精、粗饲料问题全靠农业生产来解决。他们计算好养多少猪，要多少饲料，小猪、中猪和大猪各需要多少饲料，什么时候需要什么饲料，他们就根据需要量来种植各种作物。肥料增加了，又支援了农业。第三，主要劳动力和辅助劳动力配合使用，也是上中农经营生产的一条好经验。
    在坚持按劳取酬原则下对上中农给予某些照顾
    在坚持按劳取酬的分配原则下，对上中农在经济上给予某些照顾，是当前巩固贫、中农联盟、巩固农业社的不可缺少的措施。
    把中农团结在合作社里共同进行生产，归根到底是为了全体农民的利益。但是，如果不照顾到中农的经济利益，团结生产的目的是达不到的。合作社根据贫农、上中农和社干部的意见，可以采取如下措施：一，在不影响集体经济发展的前提下，留给社员5％左右的耕地作为自留地（大约每人一分到一分二厘地），作为社员的补充收入。上中农经营园艺作物有特别好的经验，经营自留地对维持和增加他们的收入有很大的作用。二，在发展副业的同时，鼓励并帮助社员在农闲期间，发展家庭副业生产。要允许他们将自己的产品到自由市场出卖，或者卖给供销社和国营部门。允许社员留下一些半劳动力搞家庭副业生产。合作社和生产队都要进行小段排工和劳动自报办法，使社员能够安排自己的时间，利用空闲去从事家庭副业生产。生产队在首先完成合作社分配的生产任务之后，可以独立经营一些副业生产，收入归队分配。三，从1956年起，在二、三年内清还耕牛、农具的入社价款，不可任意拖延。四，果树、林木等在一个相当长期间内（如三年—五年）坚持比例分红的办法；已折价归社的，如期清还价款。零星少量的果树、林木仍归社员私有。五，对劳动力弱的社员，在排工中给予照顾。
    根据我们调查，在保证合作社逐年增产的情况下，采取这些措施后，减少收入的社员的问题，将有大约80％基本上可以获得解决。
    要采取这些适当照顾上中农利益的措施，首先要打通干部和党团员思想，发动贫农和下中农，提高他们办好社的信心，使他们都懂得解决减少收入社员和上中农问题的意义和办法，依靠他们去解决这个问题。
    加强政治思想教育工作使农民认清正确的道路
    此外，还要加强政治思想工作，提高社员思想觉悟。当前，要着重进行三方面的教育：第一是合作化优越性的教育，指出只有合作化才是正确的道路。第二是劳动教育，要向那些有劳动力而出勤少的人指出，只有积极参加劳动，才能增加生产，改善生活。第三要说明开放自由市场的目的和对农民的好处，划清农民贸易和经营商业的界限，批判弃农经商进行商业投机的思想。
    大环社这样做了，收到显著的效果，退社风潮很快就平息下来。
    〔注〕“民田地区”在中山县是在丘陵地区。因为过去沙田被称为“官田”，许多农民把一般的称为“民田”。
