Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 17th: More than 260 representatives from eighteen countries, along with the Czechoslovak people, gathered in Lidice Village on the morning of the 16th to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the destruction of Lidice Village by the Hitlerite fascist bandits.

Lidice Village is twenty-five kilometers from Prague. In June 1942, German fascists razed the village to the ground, shot all the men, sent all the women and children to concentration camps, and publicly declared that the name Lidice had been erased from the map. This cruel atrocity aroused the anger of people all over the world at that time, and in many places around the world, people named their villages, towns, or streets Lidice.

More than 10,000 people attended the commemoration meeting on the 16th, which was held on the site of the old Lidice Village, which has now become a lawn. In the "Peace and Friendship Rose Garden" between the old village and the newly rebuilt village after the war, roses of all colors are in full bloom. This rose garden was established in 1955, and the 27,000 rose bushes in the garden were donated by people from thirty-four countries.

Before the start of the meeting, the Central Committee of the Czech National Front, the women of Lidice, and foreign guests solemnly laid wreaths in front of the graves of the victims. Particularly attracting people's attention in the long line of wreath-laying were representatives from Stalingrad and Warsaw, the female mayor of Coventry, England, wearing a red robe, representatives of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs wearing kimonos, and delegations from Democratic Germany and West Germany.

In her opening speech, the chairman of the Lidice Village People's Committee, Proshkova, said that Lidice events should never be allowed to happen again anywhere in the world, and nuclear weapons should never be allowed to become a threat to destroy people.

Speakers at the meeting also included Fielinger, Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Stross, Chairman of the British "Lidice Shall Live" Committee, and Academician Tsizin, head of the Soviet delegation.

At the meeting, a letter of appeal from the women of Lidice to women all over the world was also read, calling on all mothers and women, all kind-hearted people, to wage a resolute struggle against war and fascism and to defend their children.

　　法西斯毁灭利迪泽村十五周年
    捷人民沉痛纪念浩劫
    呼吁所有善良的人们坚决反对战争
    据新华社布拉格17日电　来自十八个国家的二百六十多名代表和捷克斯洛伐克人民一起，16日上午在利迪泽村集会，纪念希特勒法西斯匪徒毁灭利迪泽村十五周年。
    利迪泽村离布拉格有二十五公里。1942年6月，德国法西斯把这个村庄夷为平地，枪杀了全部男子，把所有妇女儿童送入了集中营，并且公开宣称已经把利迪泽这个地名从地图上抹去。当时这一残酷暴行曾经引起了世界各国人民的愤怒，世界上有许多地方，人们把自己的村庄、市镇或街道命名为利迪泽。
    16日的纪念大会有一万多人参加，大会是在已经成为一块草坪的老利迪泽村旧址举行。在老村和战后重建的新村之间的“和平友谊玫瑰园”中，盛开着万紫千红的玫瑰。这个玫瑰园是在1955年建立的，园中的二万七千株玫瑰是三十四个国家的人民捐赠的。
    在大会开始前，捷民族阵线中央委员会、利迪泽妇女和外国客人们庄严地在死难者的墓前献了花圈。在长长的献花圈的行列中特别受到人们注目的是来自斯大林格勒和华沙的代表，穿着红色长袍的英国考文垂市女市长，穿着和服的日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的代表以及民主德国和西德的代表团。
    利迪泽村人民委员会主席普罗什科娃在开会词中说，不让世界上任何地方再出现利迪泽事件，永不让核武器成为毁灭人民的威胁。
    在会上讲话的还有捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席费林格、英国“利迪泽永远存在”委员会主席斯特罗斯、苏联代表团团长齐津院士等。
    会上还宣读了利迪泽妇女致全世界妇女的呼吁书，呼吁所有母亲和妇女、所有善良的人们为反对战争和法西斯主义，为保卫自己的孩子作坚决的斗争。
