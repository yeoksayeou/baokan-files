　　Bouchier-Maunoury
    The new French Prime Minister, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, is 42 years old and the youngest Prime Minister in French cabinets since 1883. He was born in the village of Louisain, Eure-et-Loir province, in western France, a few days after the outbreak of World War I (August 19, 1914).

    Bourgès-Maunoury graduated from France's elite military and scientific school, the "Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris," and holds a Bachelor of Laws degree.

    After the outbreak of World War II, he was mobilized into the army in 1939, serving as a lieutenant in the artillery. After the fall of France in 1940, he spent a year as a prisoner of war in Germany. After returning to his country in 1941, he participated in the Resistance movement, soon taking on a leadership role within it.

    After the war, Bourgès-Maunoury joined the French Radical-Socialist Party. In 1946, he was elected as a member of the Second Constituent Assembly of France, and in 1951, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly. From 1947 onwards, he successively served as Under-Secretary of State for the Budget, Minister of Public Works, Minister of National Defense, Minister of Finance, Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Minister of the Interior. In 1952 and 1953, he twice represented France at the United Nations General Assembly.

    In the previous Mollet cabinet, Bourgès-Maunoury served as Minister of National Defense, resolutely implementing the policy of continuing the colonial war in Algeria. He not only supported the "Paris Agreements" but was also an active supporter of the "European unification movement."
