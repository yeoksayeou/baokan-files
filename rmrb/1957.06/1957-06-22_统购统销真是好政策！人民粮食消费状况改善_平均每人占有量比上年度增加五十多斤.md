Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the Ministry of Food that in the 1956-1957 fiscal year (July 1956 - June 1957), on the basis of implementing the unified grain purchase and sale policy, the state continued to ensure the necessary grain supply in all aspects, and the grain consumption situation of the people across the country has further improved.

　　Last year, some provinces in our country suffered severe disasters, but due to the superiority of the cooperative economy, the national grain output still increased by tens of billions of jin compared to the bumper harvest of 1955. At the same time, the state purchased less and sold more grain by 20 billion jin compared to the previous year, and the grain consumed by the people across the country increased by more than 30 billion jin compared to the previous year. Calculated on the basis of the national population, the average possession per person per year increased by more than 50 jin. From a national perspective, the grain situation is stable, the number of live pigs has increased, and rural sideline occupations have also developed. This is the achievement of grain work in the past year.

　　In the past year, the state has taken great care of disaster victims. A total of 13 billion jin of grain was purchased less and sold more in disaster-stricken areas, and a large amount of grain was allocated to supply the people in disaster areas, effectively supporting production and disaster relief work in disaster areas. According to materials from the Ministry of Food, the average grain possession of disaster victims in the past year was 12 liang to 1 jin per person per day, exceeding the consumption of disaster victims in any previous disaster year. Compared with the situation before liberation, there is a world of difference. Before liberation, farmers in many areas could only eat one or two liang of grain per person per day when they encountered disasters, or at most a few liang of grain, and many disaster victims could not eat at all and even starved to death.

　　In the past year, the grain consumption level of people in non-disaster-stricken areas, especially poor peasants and some lower-middle peasants, has generally improved. Before cooperativization, the grain consumption level of poor peasants and some lower-middle peasants was relatively low due to economic conditions. After agricultural cooperativization, their income generally increased, and their grain consumption also increased. This is very beneficial to the development of agricultural productive forces.

　　However, in the past year, the state used more than billions of jin of stored grain to ensure grain supply. In addition, there were still considerable difficulties in grain allocation. Grain production in our country is increasing very slowly, but people's need for grain far exceeds the growth of production. Therefore, the grain shortage in our country cannot be changed in the short term. The Ministry of Food requires all localities to implement the grain production increase and conservation campaign, requiring urban people's grain consumption to remain stable at the existing level, and requiring appropriate restraint in rural grain consumption.

　　统购统销真是好政策！
　　人民粮食消费状况改善
    平均每人占有量比上年度增加五十多斤
    新华社21日讯　新华社记者从粮食部获悉：1956—1957年度（1956年7月—1957年6月），国家在贯彻粮食统购统销政策的基础上，继续保证了各方面必需的粮食供应，全国人民的粮食消费状况也有了进一步改善。
    去年，我国若干省份受灾很重，但由于合作经济的优越性，全国粮食的产量仍比丰收的1955年增产了一百几十亿斤。同时，国家比上年度又少购多销了粮食二百亿斤，全国人民消费的粮食比上年度增加了三百多亿斤，如按全国人口平均计算，每人全年的占有量增加了五十多斤。从全国范围内说，粮食局势是稳定的，生猪有所增多，农村副业也有所发展。这就是过去一年粮食工作的成绩。
    过去一年，国家对灾民作了很大照顾。共计在受灾地区少购多销了一百三十亿斤粮食，并且调拨了大批粮食供应灾区人民，有力地支持了灾区的生产救灾工作。根据粮食部的材料，过去一年灾民占有的粮食，每人每天平均是十二两到一斤，超过以往任何遭灾年的灾民的消费量。比起解放以前的情况，更有天壤之别。解放前，许多地区农民遇灾，每人每天只能吃到一、二两粮食，顶多吃几两粮食，许多灾民根本吃不上以至饿死。
    过去一年，没有受灾地区的人民，特别是贫农和部分下中农的粮食消费水平，普遍有了提高。合作化以前，贫农和一部分下中农因为限于经济条件，粮食消费水平比较低，农业合作化以后，他们收入普遍有所增加，粮食消费量也就提高了。这对发展农业生产力是大有好处的。
    但是过去一年，国家为保证粮食供应，却挖用了几十多亿斤库存粮食，另外，在粮食调度上也还存在着相当的困难。我国粮食增产很慢，可是人民对粮食的需要远远超过生产的增长。因此，我国粮食紧张情况在短期内还不能改变。粮食部要求各地贯彻粮食增产节约运动，要求城市人民的粮食消费稳定在现有的水平上，要求农村的粮食消费也有适当节制。
