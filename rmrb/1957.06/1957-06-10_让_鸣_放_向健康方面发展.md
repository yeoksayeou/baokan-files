Let "Blooming" and "Contending" Develop in a Healthy Direction
Zhu Xuefan

Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on rectification in late April and earnestly requested non-Party figures to help the Communist Party carry out rectification, the upsurge of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has reached an unprecedented peak in the past month or so. People have put forward criticisms and suggestions to the Party with the enthusiasm of supporting the Communist Party and supporting socialism. It should be said that this is a very gratifying and good phenomenon. It is a continuation of the promotion of socialist democracy, and the Chinese Communist Party has creatively set a good example of socialist democracy.

Why does the Party want to rectify itself? Obviously, it is because the Chinese Communist Party is already the ruling party of our country, shouldering the historical task of leading 600 million people in socialist construction. It needs to constantly overcome shortcomings and mistakes and lead national affairs better. Therefore, anyone who helps with rectification should first be clear that rectification is to strengthen the Party's leading role in the socialist cause and to consolidate the socialist system. If one deviates from this solemn purpose, it is a violation of the common interests of the people of the whole country and cannot be tolerated.

	"Say all you know and say it without reserve" is not equal
	to not being reasonable and not distinguishing right from wrong.

However, recently, while the people have been speaking out freely, a few people have even made remarks to abolish or weaken the leadership of the Party, wanting to overturn the socialist system that has been won through hard struggle, and to make history go backwards. There are also some remarks that are flaunting the banner of Marxism-Leninism, ostensibly supporting socialism, but in essence, they are peddling capitalism. These remarks are undoubtedly a trampling on the precious democratic life of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." It is something that all people with patriotic enthusiasm cannot stand idly by. There are also some people who do not start from good intentions, but instead use the tone of a shrew cursing the street to slander and abuse the Communist Party, and even use despicable anonymous threatening letters to insult others. This kind of bad behavior cannot be tolerated by anyone. "Say all you know and say it without reserve" does not mean that you can be unreasonable, not distinguish right from wrong, and not distinguish between ourselves and the enemy. For example, the remarks of Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at Renmin University, almost make people unable to believe that these are from the mouth of a senior intellectual living in New China. Saying "China is the China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries." What is this talk? Can the people's ranks include counter-revolutionaries? Saying "The masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill Communists." What is this position? Who has the Communist Party struggled for for decades? Who did many revolutionary martyrs advance wave upon wave for? The common people know. I would like to tell Ge Peiqi and those who have made similar fallacies as Ge Peiqi, don't be such alarmists. The common people understand right and wrong the most. They know who liberated the workers from slave life, who destroyed the feudal mountains on the heads of the peasants, and let the peasants embark on collective production; who made it possible for all patriotic people to contribute their strength to build the motherland, so that people's lives are gradually improving, and they can see their happy future. The powerful Chinese Communist Party and the awakened Chinese people will not let history go backwards. China will surely be rich and strong, and socialism will surely win.

The Party's attitude towards shortcomings and mistakes is not to conceal them but to expose them, not to shield them but to correct them.

Yes, the Communist Party has certain shortcomings in leading national affairs in the past few years. As mentioned in the recent suggestions from all parties. Similarly, the Communist Party itself does not shy away from the fact that there are shortcomings and mistakes such as bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism among party members who are divorced from the masses and reality. But what attitude does the Party take towards these shortcomings and mistakes? It does not conceal them, but exposes them, does not shield them, but corrects them seriously. The Party is resolutely opposed to these bad things. Only a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism can have this kind of courage to face up to shortcomings and be brave in correcting mistakes. Only a strengthened and consolidated Communist Party has this possibility. Just look at the previous rulers of China before liberation, including the Chiang Kai-shek Group, when did they carry out rectification, when did they criticize themselves? When did they allow the people to criticize the government? A hundred years of history proves that in the past, those regimes representing feudal landlords and bureaucratic bourgeoisie could only be corrupt, oppress the people, and betray national sovereignty and humiliation. Just look at the actions of the former Qing Dynasty, Yuan Shikai, the Northern Warlords, and even the Chiang Kai-shek Group when they ruled the old China! Take a closer look at Taiwan today! American imperialism can station troops everywhere, arbitrarily seize economic resources, Americans kill Chinese compatriots, but instead apologize and pay compensation to the United States. As long as imperialism wants to do bad things, it can do whatever it wants. Can we say they are patriotic?

All criticisms and suggestions should proceed from maintaining socialism and consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party.

Now the people of the whole country are responding to the Party's call to help the Party carry out rectification, and are speaking out freely on a large scale. This is a good phenomenon that has never happened in history. All those who support the Communist Party and maintain socialism should continue to speak out freely in the spirit of saying all they know and saying it without reservation. So that the Communist Party, which leads national affairs, may find shortcomings and mistakes from the problems discovered and overcome and improve them. However, in the process of speaking out, we must not blur the general direction, abandon the ideological struggle of class consciousness, and all criticisms and suggestions should proceed from the requirements of maintaining socialism and consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party. We must not allow capitalist ideas to raise their heads, and we must not allow distorted remarks to confuse the public. We welcome the展开 discussion and clarify the rights and wrongs from the discussion. So that all those who participate in the rectification and help with the rectification can be further improved ideologically in this great movement and strengthen their unity. Only by clearly distinguishing right from wrong can the socialist cause continue to develop, and only by criticizing those ulterior motives of distorted remarks and behaviors can we make the hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend develop in a healthy direction.

    让“鸣”“放”向健康方面发展
    朱学范
    从中共中央4月下旬发出了整风指示，并热切要求党外人士帮助共产党进行整风之后，这一个多月来，百花齐放、百家争鸣的热潮，达到了前所未有的高峰。人们以拥护共产党、拥护社会主义的热忱，对党提出了批评的意见。应该说这是十分可喜的好现象。是社会主义民主的继续发扬光大，是中国共产党创造性地树立了社会主义民主的良好榜样。
    党为什么要整风呢，很明显，是因为中国共产党已经是我们国家执政的党，肩负着领导六亿人民进行社会主义建设的历史重任。需要不断地克服缺点和错误，把国家事务领导得更好。因此任何一个帮助整风的人，首先应该明确：整风是为了加强党在社会主义事业中的领导作用，是为了巩固社会主义制度。如果离开了这一庄严的目的，那就是违反全国人民的共同利益，是不能容许的。
      知无不言、言无不尽不等
  于不讲道理不明是非。
    但是最近在大鸣大放的同时，居然有少数人发表取消或是削弱党的领导的言论，想把千辛万苦争取得来的社会主义制度打翻，要使历史倒退，还有些言论是举着马列主义的幌子，表面上拥护社会主义，实质上是在那里兜售资本主义。这些言论，无疑是对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一珍贵的民主生活的践踏。是一切具有爱国热忱的人，所不能袖手旁观的。还有些人不是从善意出发，竟以泼妇骂街的口吻，对共产党污蔑、谩骂，甚至以卑鄙的匿名恐吓信去辱骂人家。这种恶劣行为，谁也不能容忍。“知无不言、言无不尽”不等于可以不讲道理、不明是非、不分敌我。比如像人民大学讲师葛佩琦之类的言论，几乎使人不能相信这是出于一个生活在新中国的高级知识分子之口。说“中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内。”这是什么话？人民队伍里还能包括反革命？说“群众是要推翻共产党，杀共产党人。”这是什么立场？共产党奋斗几十年为了谁，许多革命烈士前仆后继为了谁，老百姓是知道的。奉告葛佩琦以及和葛佩琦发表类似谬论的人，不消你们这样杞人忧天。老百姓是最懂得是非的。他们懂得是谁把工人从奴隶生活中解放出来，是谁把农民头上的封建大山摧毁了，让农民走上集体生产；是谁使一切爱国人民有可能贡献自己的力量，来建设祖国，使人们的生活日渐向上，看见自己的幸福前途。强大的中国共产党，觉悟了的中国人民，是不会让历史往后倒退的。中国必定富强，社会主义必定胜利。
    党对缺点和错误的态度，不是隐瞒而是揭发，不是包庇而是纠正。
    是的，共产党几年来在领导国家事务中间，某些方面是存在着缺点的。正如最近各方面提意见中所说的那样。同样共产党自己并不讳言，党员中间有着脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义等缺点和错误。但是党对这些缺点和错误，是采取什么态度呢？它不是隐瞒，而是揭发，不是包庇，而是严肃的纠正。党是坚决反对这些坏东西的，这种敢于正视缺点、勇于纠正错误的气魄，只能是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党才能如此。只有壮大了的、巩固了的共产党才有这种可能。试看解放前中国历代执政者包括蒋介石集团在内，几时进行过整风，几时批评过自己？几时允许人民批评过政府？百年来的历史证明，过去那些代表封建地主、官僚资产阶级的政权，只能是腐朽的、欺压人民、丧权辱国的。且看前清王朝、袁世凯、北洋军阀，以至蒋介石集团在统治旧中国时候的所作所为吧！近的再看看今天的台湾吧！美帝国主义可以到处驻兵，随便攫取经济富源，美国人杀死了中国同胞，反而向美国道歉赔罪，只要是帝国主义想做的坏事，都可以为所欲为，能说他们是爱国的吗？
    一切批评建议都应从维护社会主义、巩固共产党的领导出发。
    现在全国人民响应党的号召，帮助党进行整风，正在大放大鸣，这是历史上从来没有的好现象，所有拥护共产党的，维护社会主义的人，都应该不断地本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，继续大放大鸣。使得领导国家事务的共产党，有可能从发现的问题中找出缺点和错误，加以克服改进。但是在鸣放中间我们不能模糊了总的方向，放弃了阶级意识的思想斗争，一切批评、建议，都应该从维护社会主义的要求、巩固共产党的领导出发。不能让资本主义思想抬头，不能让歪曲言论混淆视听。欢迎展开争论，从争论中辨清是非。从而使所有参加整风的人和帮助整风的人，在这一伟大运动中，在思想上得到进一步的提高，并加强了团结。唯有明辨了是非，才能使社会主义事业不断发展，也唯有批判那些别有用心的歪曲言论、行为，才能使百花齐放百家争鸣向健康方向发展。
