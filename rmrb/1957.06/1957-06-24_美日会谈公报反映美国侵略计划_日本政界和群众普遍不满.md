Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: Japanese public opinion is generally dissatisfied with the joint communiqué issued by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue, jointly formed by fourteen mass organizations including the Japan Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the Japan Farmers' Association, issued a statement on June 22nd, accusing the communiqué of treating the Japanese people's demand for the return of Okinawa Island to Japan with "abstract and vague wording;" and further accusing Nobusuke Kishi of violating his own promise by confirming the indefinite occupation of Okinawa Island by the United States. In the statement, the fourteen groups stated that they would unite the strength of the Japanese people to launch a powerful movement to demand that the United States change its policy toward Japan and return Okinawa Island to Japan.

Iwai Akira, the Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), which has more than three million members, said yesterday that the US-Japan communiqué reflects the American aggression plan. Japan is still in a subordinate position to the United States. When talking about the Okinawa Island issue, Iwai Akira said that we will not allow the Americans to permanently occupy this island of Japan.

Many newspapers today published commentaries on the US-Japan talks. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said in a commentary that Nobusuke Kishi "failed to meet the expectations of the Japanese public" and that he "failed on all important issues" in his talks with the United States. The newspaper said, "There is no doubt that the ruling party has unhappily discovered that the hopes it raised have been mocked."

The "Asahi Shimbun" said that the Southeast Asia development plan, to which Nobusuke Kishi had great hopes, was rejected by the American leaders. It also pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi was unable to obtain specific guarantees on the issue of relaxing trade restrictions with China, which the Japanese people strongly demanded. The newspaper accused Nobusuke Kishi of "playing politics." It said that our impression is that Nobusuke Kishi is not conveying the demands of the Japanese people to the United States, but is trying to strengthen the position of the conservative party he leads. The "Asahi Shimbun" accused Nobusuke Kishi's actions in Washington of narrowing the scope of Japan's diplomatic activities from the world to the United States. The "Mainichi Shimbun" also pointed out that the results of the US-Japan talks cannot completely satisfy the Japanese people.

The "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" accused Nobusuke Kishi of failing to obtain concrete results on the issues of expanding trade with China and removing American trade restrictions on Japanese goods.

While promoting the "achievements" of Nobusuke Kishi's talks, Japanese government officials could not conceal their dissatisfaction with the results of the talks. Deputy Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii said that the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" should be revised. At the time these treaties were signed, Japan was under the occupation of the Allied forces, but the situation has changed considerably, Japan has joined the United Nations, and has gradually established "self-defense" forces.

### 美日会谈公报反映美国侵略计划  日本政界和群众普遍不满

　　美日会谈公报反映美国侵略计划
    日本政界和群众普遍不满
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本公众对于日本首相岸信介同美国总统艾森豪威尔联合发表的会谈公报普遍表示不满。
    由日本社会党、日本工会总评议会、日本农民协会等十四个群众团体联合组成的解决冲绳问题国民运动联络会议6月22日发表声明，指责这项会谈公报用“抽象的措词含混地”对待日本人民提出的把冲绳岛归还日本的要求问题；并且指责岸信介违背他自己提出的诺言，确认美国无限期地占领冲绳岛。十四个团体在声明中表示，它们要团结日本人民的力量，展开一个强有力的运动，要求美国改变对日本的政策，并且把冲绳岛归还日本。
    拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会的事务局长岩井章昨天说，日美会谈公报反映了美国的侵略计划。日本仍然处于从属于美国的地位。在谈到冲绳岛问题时，岩井章说，我们不会允许美国人永久占领日本的这个岛屿。
    许多报纸今天就日美会谈发表了评论。“读卖新闻”在评论中说，岸信介“没有实现日本公众的期望”，他在同美国会谈中在“所有重要问题上都失败了”。这家报纸说，“毫无疑问，执政党已经不满意地发现：它所提出的希望遭到了愚弄”。
    “朝日新闻”说，岸信介对之抱有很大希望的开发东南亚计划被美国首脑拒绝了。它并且指出，岸信介在日本人民强烈要求的放宽对中国的贸易限制问题上也没有能够获得具体保证。这家报纸指责岸信介“玩弄政治”。它说，我们得到的印象是，岸信介不是向美国传达日本人民的要求，而是企图加强他领导的保守政党的地位。“朝日新闻”指责说，岸信介在华盛顿的行动把日本的外交活动范围从世界缩小到美国。“每日新闻”也指出，日美会谈结果不能使日本人民完全满意。
    “日本经济新闻”指责岸信介在扩大同中国的贸易和撤销美国对日本货物的贸易限制问题上没有能够得到具体成果。
    日本政府官员们在宣传岸信介会谈的“成就”的同时，也不能掩饰他们对会谈结果的不满。副首相石井光次郎说，日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”应该修改。签订这些条约的当时，日本处在盟国的占领之下，而现在形势有了相当大的变化，日本已经加入了联合国，并且逐渐建立起了“自卫”力量。
