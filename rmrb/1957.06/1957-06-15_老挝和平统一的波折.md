　　The Twists and Turns of Laos' Peaceful Reunification
　　Luo Erzhuang
    The negotiations between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units on the issue of national peaceful reunification have lasted for nearly three years, experiencing a tortuous process. Recently, just as peaceful reunification seemed within reach, new difficulties have arisen.
    The negotiations between the two sides in Laos began in August 1954 after the ceasefire in accordance with the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords stipulated that the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units should seek the peaceful reunification of Laos through consultation. In September 1954, Prince Souvanna Phouma, then the Prime Minister of Laos, had talks with Prince Souphanouvong, the leader of the Lao Fighting Units. Soon after, Prime Minister Phouma resigned and was succeeded by Katay Don Sasorith as Prime Minister. After this, the negotiations between the two sides encountered obstacles, and the Royal Government launched frequent offensives against the Lao Fighting Units, attempting to eliminate them militarily.
    However, facts proved that the method of solving the problem by force was unworkable. Under the call of the people throughout the country for peaceful negotiations, the two sides signed an agreement on March 9, 1955, in which the Royal Government "guaranteed that no hostile actions against the Lao Fighting Units would be allowed to recur - especially military offensives." However, only ten days later, the Royal Government launched a fierce attack on the Lao side. On June 27, 1955, the two sides held a military conference to discuss the division of temporary garrison areas for the two armies in Sam Neua Province, but it was delayed for several months due to the Royal side's constant introduction of new demands, and no progress was made. From October 9 to 13, 1955, Souphanouvong and Katay Don Sasorith held talks in Yangon, the capital of Burma, and signed a principled agreement on the cessation of hostilities on October 11. However, the Royal Government announced a ceasefire on the one hand, and secretly ordered an attack on the Lao side on the other. In this way, the military conflict between the two sides expanded day by day.
    At the same time, the settlement of political issues was also in an extremely difficult situation. The Royal Government attempted to use military pressure to force the Lao side to give up their due rights on political issues, insisting that the two provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua should become the Royal provincial administrative organs before the national general election, and demanded that the Lao Fighting Units be disbanded first. Therefore, although nine political conferences had been held intermittently since the beginning of 1955, each conference was unilaterally interrupted by the Royal Government, and no concrete results were obtained.
    At the beginning of 1956, the Katay Don Sasorith cabinet collapsed. In March of the same year, Prince Souvanna Phouma reassumed the post of Prime Minister of Laos, and the negotiations between the two sides in Laos entered a new stage. The military conflict between the two sides was greatly reduced, and the negotiations for peaceful reunification made important progress. On August 1, 1956, Phouma and Souphanouvong held talks in Vientiane and reached a principled agreement on some major issues. Subsequently, the two sides signed the "Agreement on the Implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities," the "Agreement on the Issue of Peaceful Neutrality," and the "Agreement on Guaranteeing the Rights of Lao Citizens." On November 7 of the same year, Phouma and Souphanouvong held talks again, and issued a joint communiqué on December 29, announcing that the two sides had reached an agreement on the following issues: guaranteeing that all male and female citizens nationwide have the right to vote and be elected; before the supplementary election of members of parliament, the Royal Government will be reorganized into a coalition government including personnel from the Lao Fighting Units; after the formation of the coalition government, the administrative organs of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces and the Lao Fighting Units will be taken over by the government and reorganized in accordance with the regulations of the Kingdom.
    On February 4 of this year, Souphanouvong arrived in Vientiane from Sam Neua and held a third round of talks with Phouma, signing an agreement on the election law on February 23. However, due to some different views on certain issues, the negotiations between the two sides came to a standstill again.
    At this time, a new twist occurred. The Lao National Assembly unanimously approved the government's agreement with the Lao Fighting Units on May 30, but did not approve the negotiations with the Lao Fighting Units in accordance with the government's report. The members of parliament demanded that Phouma earnestly implement the various agreements that had been signed. However, Prime Minister Phouma submitted his resignation on May 30. Now, Katay Don Sasorith has been ordered to organize a new cabinet. Katay Don Sasorith has made some remarks that are not conducive to promoting the peaceful reunification of Laos, which has aroused the concerns of Lao public opinion. The Lao people demand national unity and will not allow the prospects for the peaceful reunification of their motherland to dim.
    The many difficulties on the road to peaceful reunification of Laos are inseparable from the interference and obstruction of the United States. After the Geneva Conference, the influence of the United States began to further invade Laos, squeeze out the influence of France, and attempt to turn Laos into a US colony and military base. Some rubber plantations in Laos that originally belonged to French capital have fallen into the hands of the US Goodrich Rubber Company. At the same time, the United States interferes in Laos' internal affairs through so-called "aid" and seizes many strategic materials from Laos. The aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cobbled together by the United States openly included Laos within its "protection" scope. In order to obstruct Laos from moving towards peaceful neutrality, the United States has been doing its best to instigate civil war and has violated the Geneva Accords by secretly transporting weapons from Thailand into Laos. During Phouma's tenure as Prime Minister, whenever the two sides in Laos reached an agreement, US diplomatic officials would exert pressure and threats on the Lao government. On April 16 of this year, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France openly sent notes to the Lao government, urging it to reject the reasonable demands put forward by the Lao Fighting Units in order to obstruct the national reunification of Laos.
    However, the Lao people and an increasing number of political figures have realized that the only way to quickly resume negotiations, seek national peaceful reunification on a fair and reasonable basis, and implement a foreign policy of peaceful neutrality is the only way that conforms to the national interests of Laos. The recent remarks of the Vice-King of Laos, Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, expressed the firm will of the broad strata of the Lao people. He said: "Despite the obstruction of foreigners and their pawns, the two sides must still reconcile." He also pointed out in a letter to the Royal Government and parliamentary leaders that implementing the agreement signed by both sides last year is the only way for this country, which has been torn apart for twelve years, to achieve unity.
    The people of all countries who wish to see the stability and prosperity of Laos and the Southeast Asian region hope that the Lao people can continuously strengthen their unity, overcome numerous difficulties, oppose foreign interference, and strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland at an early date.

　　老挝和平统一的波折
　　罗尔庄
    老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队就全国和平统一问题进行的谈判，历时将近三年，经历了曲折的过程。最近，正当和平统一在望的时候，又发生了新的困难。
    老挝双方谈判是在1954年8月依照日内瓦协议实行停火之后开始的。日内瓦协议规定老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队应该通过协商谋求老挝的和平统一。1954年9月，当时的老挝首相富马亲王曾和寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王进行过会谈。不久，富马首相辞职，由萨索里特继任首相。此后双方谈判发生了障碍，王国政府向寮国战斗部队发动了频繁的进攻，企图在军事上消灭寮国战斗部队。
    但是，事实证明，武力解决方式是行不通的。在全国人民要求和平谈判的呼声下，双方在1955年3月9日签订了一项协议，王国政府“保证不允许任何对寮国战斗部队的敌对行动——特别是军事进攻的重演。”可是，仅在十天之后，王国政府又向寮方展开猛烈的攻击。1955年6月27日，双方曾经召开过军事会议，讨论在桑怒省划分双方军队的临时驻区问题，但因王国方面不断提出新的要求而拖延数月，未获进展。1955年10月9日至13日，苏发努冯与萨索里特在缅甸首都仰光举行会谈，并于10月11日签订了关于停止敌对行动的原则协议。但是，王国政府却一面宣布停火，一面又秘密下令向寮方进攻。这样，双方的军事冲突就日益扩大。
    与此同时，关于政治问题的解决也处于极端困难的境地。王国政府企图以军事压力在政治问题上迫使寮方放弃他们应得的权利，坚持要在全国普选之前就使丰沙里和桑怒两省成为王国的省政权机构，并要求首先解散寮国战斗部队。因此，尽管自1955年初起就断续举行了九次政治会议，但每次会议都被王国政府片面中断，而一直未能获得具体结果。
    1956年初，萨索里特内阁倒台，同年3月，富马亲王重新担任老挝首相，老挝双方谈判进入了一个新的阶段。双方的军事冲突大大减少，和平统一的谈判有了重要的进展。1956年8月1日，富马与苏发努冯在万象举行会谈，在一些主要问题上达成了原则性的协议。接着，双方先后签订了“关于执行停止敌对行动的协议”、“关于和平中立问题的协议”和“关于保障寮国公民权利的协议”。同年11月7日，富马与苏发努冯再度举行会谈，并于12月29日发表联合公报，宣布双方在以下问题上达成协议：保障全国男女公民都有选举权和被选举权；在议员的补充选举之前，把王国政府改组为包括寮国战斗部队人员在内的联合政府；联合政府组成后，桑怒和丰沙里两省的政权机构和寮国战斗部队由政府接管，并按照王国的规制加以改组。
    到了今年2月4日，苏发努冯又从桑怒到达万象，与富马举行第三次会谈，在2月23日签订了关于选举法的协议。但是由于双方对某些问题还存在一些不同的看法，双方谈判又告停顿。
    这时，新的波折又发生了。老挝国民议会在5月30日一致赞同政府同寮国战斗部队所签订的协议，但不赞同依照政府的报告同寮国战斗部队进行谈判。议员要求富马认真履行已签订的各项协议。可是，富马首相在5月30日提出辞职了。现在，萨索里特受命组织新阁。萨索里特发表了一些不利于促使老挝和平统一的言论，引起老挝舆论的忧虑。老挝人民要求全国团结，不让祖国和平统一的前景黯淡下来。
    老挝和平统一道路上的重重困难，是和美国的干涉和阻挠分不开的。日内瓦会议以后，美国势力就开始进一步侵入老挝，排挤法国的势力，企图把老挝变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。老挝的一些原属法国资本的橡胶种植园已经落入美国固特立橡胶公司的手中。同时，美国并通过所谓“援助”干涉老挝内政，攫取老挝许多战略物资。美国拼凑的侵略性的东南亚集团公然把老挝列入它的“保护”范围之内。为了达到阻挠老挝走向和平中立的目的，美国竭力煽动内战，并违犯日内瓦协议，偷偷地从泰国把武器运进老挝。在富马担任首相期间，每当老挝双方达成一项协议时，美国的外交官员就对老挝政府施加压力和威胁。今年4月16日，美、英、法三国政府更公然照会老挝政府，怂恿其拒绝寮国战斗部队提出的合理要求，以阻挠老挝全国的统一。
    但是，老挝人民和越来越多的政界人物已经认识到，迅速恢复谈判，在公平合理的基础上谋求全国和平统一，执行和平中立的外交政策，是符合老挝民族利益的唯一道路。老挝副国王佩差拉最近的谈话，表达了老挝广大阶层人民的坚定意志。他说：“尽管有外国人同他们的爪牙在阻挠，但双方还是必须和解”。他还在写给王国政府和议会领袖的信中指出，实行双方在去年签订的协议，是这个经过十二年倾轧的国家获得统一的唯一方法。
    愿意看到老挝和东南亚地区的稳定和繁荣的各国人民，都希望老挝人民能够不断加强团结，克服重重困难，反对外国干涉，争取早日实现祖国的和平统一。
