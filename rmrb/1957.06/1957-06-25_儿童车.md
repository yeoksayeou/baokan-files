　　Children's Cart
　　Dian Yi
　　Since the nanny went back to the countryside to participate in production, my husband and I have suffered quite a bit. Every day we have to get up early, first send the child to kindergarten before going to work; after getting off work in the evening, we gulp down a few mouthfuls of rice and then rush to the kindergarten to pick him up.

　　Once the kindergarten teacher asked me, "Why don't you find a children's cart?" She also said, "Niu Niu and Wei Wei go to school by children's cart every day. The old man pulling the cart is very responsible for the children. If you want, you can discuss it with him."

　　The next evening, I met the old man who pulled the children's cart at the kindergarten. He was over fifty years old, his head was already bald, his complexion was still ruddy, he wore a black cotton-padded coat, tied his trouser legs, and wore a pair of "Old Man's Joy" cotton shoes. His dress and speech all showed the honest and polite demeanor of an "Old Beijinger." His surname was Zhang, and Niu Niu and Wei Wei affectionately called him "Grandpa Zhang." We agreed that from that day on, we would let Guai Guai (meaning "well-behaved") ride in his cart, but Guai Guai cried and refused, insisting that I take him home. My teacher and I persuaded him, telling him that his mother would follow behind the cart, and he finally agreed.

　　To be honest, I followed the cart at the time because the child was too naughty and I couldn't help but worry. Grandpa Zhang carried the children into the small cart one by one, bolted the door, and the children shouted, "Ooh, ooh, let's go!" Niu Niu and Wei Wei took care of Guai Guai like older sisters on the cart, finding him a "special seat" and helping him carry his schoolbag, because Grandpa Zhang said, "Guai Guai is a new passenger, everyone should take care of him." The children chatted and laughed along the way... "Turning, children, hold on tight!" Grandpa Zhang jumped out of the cart, pushing the handle to turn up a high slope. First, we arrived at Niu Niu's door. Grandpa Zhang took Niu Niu's hand and walked in, shouting, "Niu Niu is back!" The last child to be sent home was Guai Guai.

　　On the third day after work, I knew that Guai Guai would not be home until seven o'clock, but I still ran home before six o'clock and waited foolishly. I finally waited until the hour hand pointed to seven o'clock, and two minutes later, I heard a voice: "Guai Guai is back!"

　　Later, I also discovered such things: when Guai Guai played games at home, he often muttered to himself, "Ooh, ooh, let's go!" "Ming Ming (the name he gave to his doll) is a new passenger, everyone should take care of her." "Turning, children, hold on tight!"

　　One day, it was pouring rain, and there was always half a foot of water on the side of the road. When I came back from work, I wanted to send a raincoat to the child. Looking at the watch, it was already after six o'clock. I was afraid that if I went, I wouldn't meet them, and the child would come back and there would be no one at home. If I didn't send it, I was afraid that the child would get wet on the cart, and I was afraid that the children's cart wouldn't pick him up in the heavy rain. I was anxious and didn't know what to do. At seven o'clock, my husband came back. When he heard that the child hadn't returned so late, he was anxious to pick him up immediately. Just then, a very familiar voice came: "Guai Guai is back!"

　　Grandpa Zhang was already standing at the door holding Guai Guai. He was soaked all over, but there wasn't even half a drop of water on Guai Guai's body. Guai Guai said, "Grandpa Zhang said he wasn't afraid of getting wet. He didn't wear a raincoat, and he covered the cart with the raincoat."

　　I hurriedly took the child and invited Grandpa Zhang into the house to take shelter from the rain, and found two of my husband's clothes for him to change into. At first, he politely refused. That night, my husband and I finally managed to keep him for dinner. During the conversation, we learned that he was very fond of doing scientific research. In his words, "It would be great to invent something." He also told us that his wife and son sent letters from the countryside almost every day urging him to go back, saying that life was very good after joining the cooperative, and they could completely support him. He had decided to go back to his hometown in a few days, "but," he said, "before leaving, I will definitely find a more reliable children's cart than me for Guai Guai."

　　At nine o'clock, the rain stopped, and Grandpa Zhang got up to leave. Before leaving, he picked up Guai Guai again and told him, "Study hard when you grow up and become an inventor, so that in the future, what foreign countries have, we will have in China too."

　　Guai Guai said, "I won't, I'll pull a children's cart when I grow up."

　　儿童车
　　甸义
    自从保姆回乡参加生产，我和丈夫可吃了不少苦头。每天要提早起来，先把孩子送到幼儿园才能上班；晚上下班以后，扒两口饭，又得匆匆忙忙赶到幼儿园去接他。
    有一回幼儿园的老师问我：“为什么不找一辆儿童车呢？”她又说：“妞妞和微微每天都坐儿童车上学，拉车的老头儿对孩子们很负责，你若愿意可以同他商量商量。”
    第二天晚上，我在幼儿园见到那个拉儿童车的老头儿。他的年纪有五十开外，头顶已经秃光，面色还很红润，披件黑棉袄，扎着裤褪，穿一双“老头乐”的棉鞋。他的打扮和说话，都表现出“老北京”的那种忠厚、有礼貌的风度。他姓张，妞妞和微微都亲热的叫他“张大爷”。我们讲好从这天起叫乖乖坐他的车，可是乖乖哭着不肯干，一定要我送他回家。我和老师好说赖说，告诉他妈妈跟在车后边，他才答应。
    说实在的，当时我跟着车也是因为孩子太挑皮，放心不下。张大爷把孩子们一个个抱进小车箱，闩上车门，孩子们便嚷道：“呜，呜，开车了。”妞妞和微微在车上像大姐姐一样照顾乖乖，给他找了一个“特座”，帮助他拿书包，因为张大爷说了：“乖乖是新乘客，大家应该照看他。”一路上几个小朋友有说有笑……“拐弯啦，小朋友们扶好！”张大爷跳下车，推着把手转弯上了一个高坡。先到妞妞家门口，张大爷拉着妞妞的手走进去，一面嚷道：“妞妞回来喽！”最后一个送到家的孩子就是乖乖。
    第三天下班，我明知道乖乖七点钟才能到家，可是我还是不到六点钟就跑回家去傻等。好容易盼到时针指到七点钟上，过了两分钟，就听到一声：“乖乖回来喽！”
    以后，我还发现了这样的事情：乖乖在家作游戏的时候，常常自言自语的说：“呜，呜，开车了。”“明明（他给囡囡起的名字）是新乘客，大家应该照看她。”“拐弯啦，小朋友们扶好！”
    有一天，下着滂沱大雨，马路边上总有半尺深的水。下班回来，有心给孩子送雨衣去，看看表已经过了六点钟，怕去了遇不到，孩子回来反而家里没有人；不去送吧，又怕孩子坐车淋着，又怕下大雨儿童车不去接他。我急得转来转去，不知如何是好。七点多，丈夫才回来，他听说孩子这么晚还不回来，急得就要马上去接。正在这时候，一个非常熟悉的声音传来：“乖乖回来喽！”
    张大爷已经抱着乖乖站在门口，他浑身上下都淋得尽湿，可是乖乖身上连半粒水珠儿都没有。乖乖说：“张大爷说他不怕淋，他不穿雨衣，把雨衣盖在车上。”
    我急忙抱过孩子，请张大爷进屋避雨，找出两件丈夫的衣服请他换上，起先他还客气着不肯。这天晚上，我和丈夫好不容易才留住他一起吃晚饭。谈话当中，我们了解到他是非常欣慕做科学研究工作的，用他的话说就是“能发明点什么玩意儿可真棒。”他还告诉我们，他的老伴儿和儿子几乎天天从乡下来信催他回去，说家里加入合作社以后，生活很好，完全可以养他的老。他已经决定过几天就回老家去，“不过”，他说：“临走以前，一定给乖乖找一个比我还可靠的儿童车。”
    九点多钟雨住了，张大爷也起身告辞。临走，他又抱起乖乖嘱咐道：“长大了好好念书，当个发明家，让将来人家外国有的，咱们中国也都有。”
    乖乖说：“我才不呢，我长大了拉儿童车。”
