Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 25th. The expansion project of the Weihu Liang Thermal Power Plant in Urumqi has entered a stage of intense construction.

The expansion project of the Weihu Liang Thermal Power Plant began in August of last year. Currently, the construction of the towering main plant building and the foundations for the boilers and the turbine generator bases are nearing completion.

The Weihu Liang Thermal Power Plant was originally built with Soviet assistance in December 1953, with an equipment capacity of 7,000 kilowatts. In the past three years, due to the rapid development of industry in the urban and suburban areas of Urumqi, the existing power supply has been unable to meet the needs. This expansion will install three domestically produced 6,000-kilowatt turbine generators and three boilers. It is expected that the first turbine generator will be able to start supplying electricity in November.

　　苇湖梁电站正在扩建
    据新华社乌鲁木齐25日电  乌鲁木齐苇湖梁火电站的扩建工程，进入紧张施工阶段。
    苇湖梁火电站扩建工程是在去年8月动工的。目前，高大的主厂房和锅炉基础、汽轮发电机机座等土建工程，都已接近完工。
    苇湖梁火电站原是苏联帮助我国在1953年12月建成的，设备容量为七千瓩。近三年来，由于乌鲁木齐市市区和郊区工业的迅速发展，原有电力已不能满足需要。这次扩建将安装三部我国自制的六千瓩的汽轮发电机和三部锅炉，预计第一部汽轮发电机在11月间就可以开始送电。
