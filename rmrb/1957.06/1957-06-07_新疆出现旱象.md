　　Urumqi, June 5th. Since the beginning of summer in Xinjiang, the climate has been alternating between cold and warm, and the snow melting from the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains has been minimal, leading to drought in most parts of the region. According to statistics from eleven counties in five districts in southern and northern Xinjiang, by the end of May, more than 220,000 mu of late autumn crops had not been sown. Due to water shortage, many early spring crops have suffered from drought and are growing poorly; pest infestations have also occurred in counties such as Turpan. Currently, farmers in some areas have already engaged in the struggle against natural disasters.

    新疆出现旱象
    本报乌鲁木齐5日电　新疆入夏以来，气候乍寒乍暖，天山、昆仑山的积雪融化得很少，全疆大部地区出现干旱现象。据南疆和北疆五个专区十一个县的统计，到5月底，没有播种的晚秋作物有二十二万多亩。由于缺水，许多早春作物受旱，生长发育不良；吐鲁番等县还发生了虫害。目前，一部分地区的农民已经投入抗击自然灾害的斗争。
