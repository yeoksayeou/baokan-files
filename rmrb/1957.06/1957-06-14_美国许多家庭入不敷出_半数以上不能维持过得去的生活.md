Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 13th: A report recently published by the Heller Committee, which specializes in studying the living conditions of the American people, states that an American family of four needs to spend more than $5,500 a year to maintain a decent standard of living. However, more than half of American families currently earn less than $5,000 per year, and approximately one-quarter to one-third of families earn even less than $3,000 per year.

According to the committee's statistics, the average weekly income of an industrial worker in the United States is currently around $80. Therefore, his weekly income is $28 to $32 less than the amount needed to maintain a decent family life. The wages of non-industrial workers are significantly lower than those of industrial workers, so their living standards are far below a decent level.

The family budget compiled by the Heller Committee is based on the family situation in the San Francisco Bay Area, and some of the items included in the budget are rather low. For example, the committee only calculates rent at $58 per month, while in most American cities, the average rent is much higher than this amount.

### 美国许多家庭入不敷出  半数以上不能维持过得去的生活

　　美国许多家庭入不敷出
　　半数以上不能维持过得去的生活
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：专门研究美国人民生活问题的海勒斯委员会最近发表一个报告说，美国四口之家如果要维持过得去的生活，那么它一年得开支五千五百美元以上。但是，美国目前半数以上的家庭每年收入不到五千美元，约有四分之一到三分之一的家庭每年的收入甚至不到三千美元。
    根据这个委员会的统计，美国目前一个产业工人每周的收入平均是八十美元左右，因此，他每周的收入比起要维持家庭过得去的生活所需要的费用少二十八美元到三十二美元。非产业工人的工资大大低于产业工人，所以他们的生活更远远落在过得去的水平之下。
    海勒斯委员会所编制的家庭预算是以旧金山海湾地区的家庭情况为标准的，列入预算的一些项目的费用不是偏低的。例如房租一项，委员会就只以五十八美元一个月来计算，而在美国大多数城市，一般的房租都大大超过这个数目。
