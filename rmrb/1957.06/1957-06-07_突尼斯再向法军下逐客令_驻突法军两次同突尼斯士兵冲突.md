Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communique on the evening of the 4th, once again demanding that French troops withdraw from Tunisia. The communique stated that the presence of French troops in Tunisia is not necessary for maintaining the security of the "free world," but instead turns the Tunisian territory bordering Algeria into a "war zone."

According to reports in Parisian newspapers, the day before this communique was issued, French troops in Tunisia and Tunisian soldiers had two armed conflicts south of Gabès. Two French soldiers were killed, and there were injuries on both sides. The cause of these conflicts was the movement of French troops on Tunisian roads in disregard of the Tunisian government's ban.

    突尼斯再向法军下逐客令
    驻突法军两次同突尼斯士兵冲突
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：突尼斯外交部4日晚上发表公报，再一次要求法军撤出突尼斯。公报说，法军驻在突尼斯对于维护“自由世界”的安全并无必要，反而使毗连阿尔及利亚的突尼斯领土变成了“战区”。
    据巴黎报纸报道，在这个公报发表的前一天，突尼斯境内的法军同突尼斯士兵在加培斯城南两次发生武装冲突。两个法国士兵被打死，双方都有受伤。导致这些冲突的原因是法国队伍不顾突尼斯政府的禁令而在突尼斯公路上调动。
