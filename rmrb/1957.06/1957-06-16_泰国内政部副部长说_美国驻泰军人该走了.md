Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, June 15th: According to senior Thai government officials on June 14th, the Thai government is considering asking the United States to withdraw American military personnel stationed in Thailand.

According to the Thai-U.S. Military Assistance Agreement signed in 1950, the United States has a large Joint Military Advisory Group stationed within the Thai armed forces.

When asked about this matter, Thai Interior Ministry Deputy Minister Charoon Srisdiaroenkul would neither formally confirm nor deny the news. However, he said that he believes that the personnel of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group in Thailand, except for a few senior officers, can now be withdrawn, because Thai military personnel can now be considered trained.

    美国驻泰军人该走了
    新华社15日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国高级政府人士6月14日透露，泰国政府正在考虑要求美国撤走在泰国的美国军事人员。
    根据1950年签订的泰美军事援助协定，美国在泰国武装部队中派驻有一个庞大的联合军事顾问团。
    泰国内政部副部长恰鲁沙提恩在被问到这件事的时候，不肯正式证实或者否认上项消息。但是他说，他相信在泰国的美国联合军事顾问团的人员，除了少数高级军官以外，现在可以撤走了。因为泰国军事人员现在已经可以被认为是经过训练的。
