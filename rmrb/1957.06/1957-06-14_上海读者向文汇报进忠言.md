(Wenhui Daily, Shanghai, June 13) The Shanghai "Liberation Daily" and "Xinwen Daily" consecutively published three articles written by readers on June 11th and 12th, criticizing Wenhui Daily's recent coverage of the "Blooming and Contending" campaign.

The article published in "Liberation Daily" is titled "Offering Sincere Advice to Wenhui Daily," and the author is educator Shui Luo. The article states:

　　Before liberation, Wenhui Daily was a progressive newspaper, beloved by the broad masses, especially intellectuals. In the early days after liberation, Wenhui Daily also played a positive role. Therefore, the Party supported Wenhui Daily's resumption of publication in Shanghai, so that it could better play a positive role in future socialist construction and better unite intellectuals around the Party to serve socialist construction.

　　Since Wenhui Daily resumed publication, some fresh and delightful signs have emerged. Especially after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," many elderly people who rarely wrote articles also wrote articles. Everyone felt that Wenhui Daily had once again radiated its brilliance. However, since the National Propaganda Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March of this year, especially during this "Blooming and Contending" process, Wenhui Daily has gradually given me a different feeling than before. The more I read it later, the more I felt something was wrong. After Chairman Mao made a report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the enlarged Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Conference, people's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the atmosphere of "Blooming and Contending" became more active. Shanghai was especially "blooming" freely. However, Wenhui Daily always felt that "the spring chill has not yet dissipated," that it was "warm but still cold," and that the "deep mountains and high walls" could not be pushed down, so it had to "set fires" everywhere, from Shanghai to Beijing, from Hangzhou to Ningbo, from Nanjing to Wuxi, from Chongqing to Chengdu, all the way to Xinjiang, and also hoped that Communist Party members would step forward to satisfy Wenhui Daily's wishes. The CCP has already decided that the rectification method must be gentle and focused on leadership institutions, with no immediate action at the grassroots level, but Wenhui Daily is still promoting the idea of focusing the "Blooming and Contending" on the grassroots level. The one-sided introduction of Peking University's "Democracy Wall" especially makes people feel like they are stirring up trouble. Our colleagues in the education sector feel that this approach is really inappropriate. Not only that, but in the "Blooming and Contending" process, many of Wenhui Daily's headlines imply that people should talk about the positives, achievements, and different opinions, which violates the spirit of "Blooming and Contending." Moreover, it advocates that criticism should be as sharp as possible. Therefore, some articles, such as those that describe the Communist Party as a worthless "evil mother-in-law" or even believe that "what's wrong with killing bureaucracy with one blow," spread the feeling that the CCP is going to "retract" everything, etc. For those reactionary remarks and words that exceed the scope of "Blooming and Contending," they are either added with decorative borders or published in prominent positions. However, the attitude towards some rebuttals is not so clear, and the page titles are also lackluster. This cannot help but make people suspect what path Wenhui Daily is trying to lead intellectuals down. No wonder some people say that Wenhui Daily now looks somewhat like a right-wing newspaper.

　　In my opinion, Wenhui Daily's current approach is not leading intellectuals towards brightness, socialism, and progress, but is leading intellectuals into a dead end. Perhaps Wenhui Daily will not agree with my view. However, as far as I know, in higher education and secondary and primary school education, most people are dissatisfied with Wenhui Daily's current approach. The person in charge of Wenhui Daily may not have felt this. In fact, some readers have already expressed dissatisfaction with Wenhui Daily. I have always cherished Wenhui Daily, but in recent days, my emotions have changed somewhat. Although I am still reading Wenhui Daily, I am already intentionally or unintentionally trying to see what strange or even reactionary remarks have been made. I think I am definitely not the only one with this feeling. Therefore, as a loyal reader, I cannot help but feel sorry for the decline in Wenhui Daily's reputation!

　　Today, although I have read the editorial "Drawing a Clear Line and Continuing to Bloom and Contend," I still cannot eliminate my previous views on Wenhui Daily. And the editorial itself is very empty. If you were to compare it with the comments from a few days ago, it would be much inferior. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the person in charge of Wenhui Daily can carefully study the layout, headlines, comments, communications, and essays of the past one or two months. Is Wenhui Daily's approach right or wrong? Is it beneficial to socialism or not? Please Wenhui Daily colleagues cherish the glorious history you once had and extricate yourselves from the maze.

　　Xinwen Daily consecutively published Shen Yiwei's "Such 'Objective' Attitude" and Zhou Youxun's "Also Offering a Word to Wenhui Daily."

　　Shen Yiwei said in "Such 'Objective' Attitude": When reading recent reports in "Wenhui Daily" about anti-socialist remarks appearing in the "Blooming and Contending," I always feel that the newspaper's attitude and position are contrary to the readers' anger. When "Wenhui Daily" published Chu Anping's and He Xiangning's speeches, it used "Special Dispatch from This Newspaper" and added decorative borders to publish the former's fallacies in full, while for the latter's two hopes, the headline only marked the point of hoping that Communist Party members would be determined to rectify and non-Party members would sincerely help rectify, and did not mark the point of analyzing the erroneous thoughts and attitudes of a very small number of rightists. After giving other examples, Shen Yiwei said: "Wenhui Daily's" "objective" attitude shown in recent times is actually a preference for wrong opinions, deliberately diminishing the impact of correct counter-criticism, and holding an ambiguous tolerant attitude towards some malicious insults and intimidation tactics. He asked "Wenhui Daily" to consider: Is such an attitude beneficial to the development of the Party's rectification movement?

### 上海读者向文汇报进忠言

　　上海读者向文汇报进忠言
    本报上海13日电　6月11、12日的上海解放日报、新闻日报连续发表了三篇读者写的文章，对文汇报在最近期间关于鸣放的报道提出了批评。
    解放日报发表的文章题目是：“对文汇报进忠言”，作者是教育工作者水洛。文章说：
    解放以前文汇报是一张进步的报纸，它为广大群众尤其是知识分子所喜爱。解放初期文汇报也起了一定的积极的作用，因此党支持文汇报在上海复刊，使它在今后的社会主义建设中能更好的发挥积极作用，更好的团结知识分子在党的周围，为社会主义建设服务。
    文汇报复刊以来，出现了一些清新可喜的气象，特别在中共中央提出了百花齐放百家争鸣的方针以后，许多不大写文章的老年人也都写了文章，大家觉得文汇报又放出了它的光彩。可是从今年3月中共中央召开全国宣传会议以来，特别是在这次鸣放的过程中，文汇报渐渐给我一种与以往不同的感觉，越到后来越看越觉得不对头。毛主席在扩大最高国务会议上做了正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告和全国宣传会议以后，人心大为振奋，鸣放空气也更见活跃，上海更是大放特放。但文汇报总觉得“春寒未尽”，“似暖还寒”，山深墙高推不倒，所以要到处放火，从上海到北京，从杭州到宁波，从南京到无锡，从重庆到成都，一直放到新疆，而且还希望共产党员挺身而出，以满足文汇报的愿望。中共已经决定整风方法必须和风细雨，重点在领导机构，基层暂不进行，但文汇报仍然在那里宣传把鸣放的重点放到基层去。片面地介绍北大“民主墙”，尤其使人感到有点唯恐天下不乱的样子。我们教育界的同仁感到这种做法实在欠妥。不但如此，在鸣放过程中，文汇报的许多标题暗示人家讲正面、成绩、不同见解，就是违反鸣放精神，而且，主张批评要越尖锐越好。因此有些文章如把共产党说成一钱不值的“恶婆婆”，甚至认为“能一棍子打死官僚主义又有何不可”，散布中共要“收”的感觉等等。对于那些反动言论和超越鸣放范围的话，不是加花边框框，就是以显著地位刊载。而对一些反驳言论，态度就不是那样明朗，版面标题也就无精打彩。这就不能不使人怀疑，文汇报究竟要把知识分子引到什么路上去，无怪乎有人说文汇报现在倒有些像右派的报纸了。
    依我看来，文汇报现在这样的做法，不是把知识分子引向光明，引向社会主义，引向进步，而是把知识分子引导到死胡同里去。我这样的看法也许文汇报是不会同意的。可是，据我所知，在高教界、中小学教育界，大多数人对文汇报现在这样的做法是不满的。这一点可能文汇报的负责人并没有感觉到。事实上，已经有读者向文汇报表示不满。我个人一直是爱护文汇报的，但是这些日子来，我的情绪有些变化。虽然我还在阅读文汇报，但是已经有意无意地好像是为了想从文汇报上看看又出了些什么稀奇古怪，甚至反动的言论来。我想有这个心情的人决不只我一个。因此做为一个忠实的读者不能不为文汇报的声誉的衰落而感到惋惜！
    今天，我虽然读了“划清界限继续鸣放”的社论，但仍不能消除我对文汇报前一阶段的看法。而社论本身非常空洞，如果要拿来和前些日子的评论比较，那是逊色得多。因此我热诚地希望文汇报的负责人最好能把最近一两个月的版面、标题、评论、通讯、杂文做一番仔细的研究，文汇报这样的做法究竟是对还是不对，究竟是有利于社会主义还是不利于社会主义。请文汇报的同仁们爱惜自己曾经有过的那段光荣的历史，从迷途中自拔出来。
    新闻日报连续发表了沈一维的“如此‘客观’态度”和周有勋的“也向文汇报进一言”两篇文章。
    沈一维在“如此‘客观’态度”一文中说：读到最近“文汇报”上有关鸣放中出现的反社会主义言论的报道时，总觉得报纸跟读者的愤怒情绪有一种适得其反的态度和立场。“文汇报”在刊登储安平和何香凝的发言时，对前者的谬论用“本报专电”并加花边全文刊出，而对后者提出的两点希望，标题中只标出了希望共产党员决心整风和党外人士诚恳帮助整风的一点，没有把分析极少数右派分子的错误思想和态度一点标出来。沈一维在举出了其他的一些例子以后说：“文汇报”在最近时期表现的“客观”态度，实际上是对错误意见的偏爱，有意缩小正确的反批评的影响，对一些恶劣的辱骂和恐吓手段，又抱着暧昧的容忍态度。他要求“文汇报”考虑：这样的态度对党的整风运动的发展是不是有利？
