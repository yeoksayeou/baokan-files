Chen Shutong Says at Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium:
　　Zhang Naiqi's Article is a Prominent Example of Trafficking in Capitalist Ideas

　　I want to state first that these are only personal views and do not represent the opinion of any organization.
　　Why did the industrial and commercial circles develop slackening thoughts after the high tide, and after the Party and government gave them meticulous care?

　　More than a year ago, industrial and commercial circles welcomed the high tide of complete industry-wide joint ownership with gongs and drums. After the high tide, the Party and government encouraged the enthusiasm of industrial and commercial circles from all aspects, politically and economically. Just in terms of fixed interest, friends in industrial and commercial circles at the time thought that the fixed interest period would be no more than three years, and the fixed interest rate would not exceed three percent. However, Chairman Mao announced that the fixed interest rate would be uniformly five percent, unchanged for seven years, and could even be extended a little. Friends in industrial and commercial circles were overjoyed at this decision.

　　The intention of the Party and government is understandable: to allow industrial and commercial circles to work with peace of mind, study with peace of mind, and accept transformation with peace of mind. Therefore, many advanced producers and advanced workers emerged in industrial and commercial circles. However, things often do not develop as beautifully as we imagine, and slackening thoughts also emerged in industrial and commercial circles.

　　Why did the industrial and commercial circles develop slackening thoughts after the high tide, and after the Party and government gave them meticulous care? This is a question we should consider.

　　In this symposium, two issues were prominently reflected. One is the problem existing in the relationship between public and private working together, and the other is the problem existing among small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen.

　　Since the State Council's Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Offices held a symposium with industrial and commercial circles in July of last year, the relationship between public and private working together has gradually improved. However, according to the situation reflected by everyone at this symposium, the problem of private individuals having positions without power is still relatively common. Many private personnel do not receive support and assistance in their work, their suggestions are not valued, and their powers are not respected. Some public personnel are laymen in business but do not trust the private sector, and even discriminate against the private sector. Some public officials emphasize class relations and ignore the relationship between public and private cooperation, and thus treat private personnel with incorrect attitudes. Some workers and masses also still have incorrect views, and some do not accept the job assignments of private leaders. All of these situations cannot but affect the enthusiasm of private personnel. Therefore, I believe that correctly solving the problems existing in the relationship between public and private working together is a key to leveraging the active role of private personnel.

　　In small and medium-sized industry and commerce, the prominent issues are two: one is the problem of financial difficulties, and the other is the problem of removing the "capitalist" label and joining the trade union. In order to take care of the difficulties of some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, the Second National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce adopted a plan for a mutual aid fund for the livelihood of industrial and commercial circles. However, many regions have not yet organized it, and even if it is organized, it is impossible to completely solve the difficulties of industrialists and businessmen. Our federations of industry and commerce at all levels should overcome all difficulties and quickly organize the mutual aid fund for the livelihood of industrial and commercial circles; at the same time, we must conduct in-depth investigations and research, reflect the actual situation to the government and relevant departments, and provide reasonable solutions based on the actual situation. For some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen who have little fixed interest and firmly request to give up the fixed interest, it is hoped that the government will consider relieving them of their ideological burdens.

　　After the industrialists and businessmen handed over their means of production, there are still some lingering feelings about capitalism. This is understandable. Especially when encountering difficulties in work or life, it is easy to generate some negative emotions. We should understand this feeling, help industrialists and businessmen resolve the difficulties that should be resolved in work and life, and not simply blame industrial and commercial circles.

　　Judging from the problems reflected in this symposium, the work of our Federation of Industry and Commerce has great shortcomings. We do not have a thorough understanding of the real situation of industrialists and businessmen, and we have not been able to help them improve the relationship between public and private working together, support them in contributing their knowledge and talents in production and management, and give full play to their enthusiasm. We have also not paid enough attention to the political and economic demands of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, and our support has been weak. This time, after everyone has exposed the problems, our Federation of Industry and Commerce should work hard to improve its work. I think the Party and government will also gradually resolve the problems according to their nature. This will have a significant impact on the Party's rectification campaign, on improving the production and management of enterprises, and on further leveraging the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, the national industrial and commercial circles should also eliminate all worries, continue to greatly unleash ideas and speak out freely, and expose all existing problems, which is beneficial to socialist construction.

　　Without the leadership of the working class, the national bourgeoisie would not have today's status.

　　However, we should also note that in this great unleashing of ideas and speaking out freely, it is undeniable that some non-socialist and chaotic thoughts have also been exposed. If we cannot distinguish right from wrong and clarify these chaotic thoughts, it will not only hinder "contention" but also lead us down the wrong path. Therefore, we must clarify issues of principle.

　　First, our industrial and commercial circles must understand that only by obeying the leadership of the working class can we take the socialist path through peaceful means. Otherwise, we will take the capitalist road of no return. The capitalist road cannot coexist with socialism, let alone coexist for a long time. This is the most basic principle. If we violate this principle and deny the leadership of the working class, then the national bourgeoisie would not have today's status, and the history of China's socialist revolution would have to be rewritten from the beginning. But some people verbally acknowledge leadership, but actually use various sophistry to deny the leadership of the working class. Regrettably, the articles recently published in the newspaper and the sixth issue of the "Industry and Commerce Circles" monthly magazine by Comrade Zhang Naiqi, vice chairman of our association, are prominent examples of trafficking in capitalist ideas under the guise of contention. He said: "The difference between leaders and those who are led in history can only be the difference between the advanced and the backward." This means that the only difference between leaders and those who are led is that advanced elements lead backward elements, and there is no class difference; that is to say, there is no issue of one class leading another. This not only denies the leadership of the working class today, but also fundamentally denies the existence of social classes.

　　Second, we say that duality is a characteristic of the national bourgeoisie. With the positive side of duality, the national bourgeoisie has the possibility of participating in the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and has the possibility of taking the peaceful path. The nature of duality changes with the times. From the perspective of the change of duality, today's so-called duality is mainly the socialist side and the capitalist side. The duality after the high tide is very different from the duality before the high tide, and it is constantly changing. The duality in the future will inevitably be different from the duality now. The general trend is that the socialist side continues to grow, while the capitalist side continues to shrink. But because the capitalist side has not been completely eliminated, our industrialists and businessmen still need to continue to transform themselves, and any idea or practice of relaxing the transformation is wrong. Of course, workers also have shortcomings and need to be transformed. Chairman Mao said, "Who said that workers do not need to be transformed?" But because workers are the exploited class, they have no lingering feelings for capitalism, so the transformation of workers is fundamentally different from the transformation of industrial and commercial circles. Some people say: "Every class, everyone has duality and needs to be transformed." This is a completely wrong statement that confuses the working class with the national bourgeoisie.

　　Third, some people believe that fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income, which is absurd. The fixed interest paid by the state every year is the product of the labor of the working class. On the one hand, since the national bourgeoisie gains without labor, the working class must inevitably gain without labor (I agree with Wu Dakun's statement). Unearned income is the same in nature as exploitative income. But precisely because some people regard fixed interest as unearned income, as if it were something that fell from the sky, they demand that the fixed interest be extended to twenty years. At the same time, they also hope that the state will pay the twenty-year fixed interest in one lump sum in order to remove the capitalist label. This idea of gaining both fame and fortune is a completely bourgeois idea, and it is natural for anyone who sincerely accepts socialist transformation and transforms themselves into a self-reliant laborer to oppose this idea.

　　The bourgeoisie and the working class are indeed two fetuses and two sets of bones.

　　I said earlier that industrialists and businessmen are prone to negative emotions when they encounter difficulties in work and life. We should help industrialists and businessmen solve the difficulties in work and life in order to give play to their positive role. I should explain that this is not to make industrialists and businessmen push all responsibilities to objective existence. On the contrary, our industrial and commercial circles must strengthen subjective efforts, improve their sense of political responsibility, and actively give play to socialist enthusiasm. In joint public-private enterprises, on the one hand, we demand to have positions and powers, and demand the respect and support of the public sector and employees. But at the same time, we must also be dutiful and responsible, actively approach the public sector and the masses of employees, actively contribute knowledge and talents, and gradually change the views of the masses of employees on us.

　　As everyone knows, the personal transformation of industrialists and businessmen should be based on the enterprise, and they should work hard in practice to transform themselves into real laborers. Some people think that they are already very progressive, and they feel unconvinced when they hear that they still need to be transformed. I believe that the progress of individuals among industrialists and businessmen is uneven. Some are progressive, some are in the middle, and some are still backward. There is no end to progress, and progressive people should not only continue to progress but also help others to progress. Some people are afraid of being reborn, thinking that there are endless worries. I believe that the bourgeoisie and the working class are indeed two fetuses and two sets of bones in terms of class essence. To change from a bourgeois element to a working-class element, one must shed the capitalist fetus and change to socialist bones. At present, the socialist side of industrial and commercial circles is growing, and the capitalist side is shrinking, and finally it will be eliminated. This is the process of being reborn. Everyone is shedding and changing. When the day comes when you have already shed and changed, who will ask you to shed and change again? Why would there be endless worries?

　　Any practice of opposing subjectivism with subjectivism, opposing bureaucracy with bureaucracy, and opposing dogmatism with dogmatism or even revisionism is not correct.

　　We are helping the Party to carry out rectification in order to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The method we adopt is unity, criticism, and unity; and our purpose is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen socialist unity, and that is to better build socialism. Since letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a good way to handle contradictions among the people, we should not only "let go" but also "let go" together; not only "contend" but also "contend." In order to distinguish right from wrong and make progress together, we should also exchange opinions calmly and realistically. I criticize others in order to help others make progress; others criticize me in order to help me make progress. We unite on the basis of socialist unity, our goals are consistent, and different opinions can be gradually unified through discussion. Any practice of opposing subjectivism with subjectivism, opposing bureaucracy with bureaucracy, and opposing dogmatism with dogmatism or even revisionism is not correct. Exposing contradictions and opposing the "three evils" is to improve the ideological understanding of Marxism-Leninism, further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and enhance the unity of the people of the whole country, and not for other purposes. Because the Party can consistently fight against mistakes and correct them in time, our Party is correct, glorious, and great. This large-scale rectification movement is a very good example.

　　Three Suggestions

　　Finally, based on the problems reflected in this symposium, I would like to make three suggestions:

　　First, many people at the symposium suggested that political and ideological education should be further strengthened for the three parties of workers, public officials and private individuals, which is completely necessary. I believe that industrialists and businessmen should further strengthen their studies and improve their socialist awareness in order to transform themselves; for public officials and workers, political and ideological education, especially education on the united front policy, should also be continuously carried out. And they should be educated to have sufficient understanding and evaluation of the changes and enthusiasm of private personnel. Managing socialist enterprises is a new job, and industrialists and businessmen should not be arrogant because they have certain business and technical knowledge. On the contrary, they should still learn from workers and public officials and strengthen their business studies, improve their skills, and improve their political awareness. As for private personnel with relatively low business and technical levels, they should naturally strengthen their studies even more. For public officials, the lack of business knowledge is a relatively common phenomenon, and they should actively respond to the Party's call to learn from the masses at any time and anywhere, and also learn from the private sector, so that they can become experts in business.

　　Second, establish and improve the enterprise management committee.

　　Some enterprises have established management committees, but they are not sound enough; some have not yet been established, and it should be established as a system with clear articles of association so that everyone can have clear responsibilities and act in accordance with the rules. I heard that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is currently exploring experience there. I believe that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should be the main body, with the participation of enterprise departments, and the participation of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, to discuss together.

　　The articles of association can be amended, and it can be decided to set down the articles of association and conduct trial implementation first, obtain experience, and then make further amendments.

　　Third, symposiums for industry and commerce.

　　Symposiums for industry and commerce are a good way to exchange opinions, coordinate public-private relations, and improve enterprise work. Vice Premier Chen Yun once instructed that all localities should make symposiums for industry and commerce a regular system. It is understood that many large cities have held them, but they have not been regularized. Some small and medium-sized cities have not held them at all. I believe that symposiums for industry and commerce, like enterprise management committees, should be institutionalized. Could it be that the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce preside over, with the participation of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, to formulate an organizational charter or something similar, so that all localities can promote it and everyone can abide by it. Symposiums for industry and commerce should not be formalized, but should have specific content. Preparations should be made before the meeting so that problems can be truly solved. In addition to the relevant business departments participating in each meeting, it is hoped that the united front departments of all localities will participate.

### 陈叔通在工商界座谈会上说：  章乃器的文章是贩运  资本主义思想的突出典型

    陈叔通在工商界座谈会上说：
    章乃器的文章是贩运
    资本主义思想的突出典型
    我先要说明，这只是个人的看法，不是代表任何组织的意见。
    为什么在高潮以后，在党和政府给以无微不至的照顾以后，工商界反而会产生松劲思想呢？
    一年多以前，工商界曾经敲锣打鼓欢迎全行业合营的高潮。高潮以后，党和政府从政治上、经济上各个方面来鼓励工商界的热情。单就定息来说，当时工商界的朋友们都认为定息期限最长不过三年，定息数目最多不会超过三厘。但是，毛主席宣布定息一律五厘，七年不变，还可以拖一个尾巴。对这个决定，工商界朋友们都是喜出望外。
    党和政府的用意，是大家所能够体会得到的，就是要工商界能够安心工作，安心学习，安心接受改造。因而，工商界里面出现了很多先进生产者与先进工作者，但是，事情的发展往往不像我们理想的美满，工商界中也出现了松劲思想。
    为什么在高潮以后，在党和政府给以无微不至的照顾以后，反而会产生松劲思想呢？这是我们应该思索的问题。
    在这次座谈会中，突出地反映了两个问题。一个是公私共事关系中所存在的问题，另一个是中小工商业者所存在的问题。
    从去年7月，国务院四、五、八办召开工商座谈会以后，公私共事关系逐步有所好转。但是根据这一次座谈会上大家所反映出来的情况来看，私方有职无权的问题仍然是比较普遍地存在的。很多私方人员在工作上得不到支持和帮助，他们的建议得不到重视，他们的职权得不到尊重。某些公方人员在业务上是外行，但不信任私方，甚至歧视私方。有的公方强调阶级关系，忽视公私共事关系，因而以不正确的态度对待私方人员。部分职工群众也还存在着不正确的看法，有的还不接受私方领导人员在职务上的调配。所有这一些情况，那能不影响私方人员的积极性呢？因此，我认为，正确地解决公私共事关系中所存在的问题，是发挥私方人员积极作用的重要关键。
    在中小工商业中，突出的是两个问题，一个是生活困难问题，一个是摘掉帽子、加入工会问题。为了照顾一些中小工商业者的困难，全国工商联第二次会员代表大会上曾经通过工商界生活互助金方案。但是，目前很多地区还没有举办，而且即使举办起来，要求全部解决工商业者的困难，也是不可能的。我们各级工商联应该克服一切困难，从速把工商界生活互助金举办起来；同时，要深入地调查研究，把实际情况反映给政府和有关部门，根据实际情况进行合理的解决。对于某些定息不多，坚决要求放弃定息的中小工商业者，希望政府考虑，解除他们思想上的包袱。
    在工商业者交出了生产资料以后，还存在一些对资本主义的留恋心情。是可以理解的。特别是在工作上或是生活上碰到了困难的时候，就容易产生一些消极情绪。我们应当理解这种心情，帮助工商业者解除工作上和生活上应该解决的困难，而不要单纯地责备工商界。
    从这次座谈会上反映出来的问题来看，我们工商联的工作是有很大的缺点的。我们对工商业者的真实情况了解不透，没有能够帮助他们搞好公私共事关系，支持他们在生产经营中贡献出知识和才能，发挥最大的积极作用。对于中小工商业者在政治上和经济上的要求，我们也关心不够，支持不力。这一次，经过大家把问题揭发出来以后，我们工商联应该努力改进工作。我想党和政府也会分别问题的性质，逐步进行解决。这对于党的整风，对于改善企业的生产经营，并进一步发挥工商业者的积极性，将会有重大的影响。因此，全国工商界也应该消除一切顾虑，继续大放大鸣，把各方面存在的问题全部揭发出来，这是有利于社会主义建设的。
    没有工人阶级的领导，民族资产阶级不会有今天的地位。
    但是，我们也应该注意，在这次大放大鸣中，不可讳言，也暴露了一些非社会主义的混乱思想，如果我们不能明辨是非，对这些混乱思想加以澄清的话，不仅会妨碍“争鸣”，而且会引导我们向错误的道路发展。因此，原则性问题，我们必须把它弄清楚。
    一、我们工商界必须明白，只有服从工人阶级的领导，我们才能通过和平道路走上社会主义。不然，就会走上资本主义的回头路。资本主义的道路是不能与社会主义共存的，更谈不到长期共存。这是最基本的原则。如果违反这个原则，否认工人阶级的领导，那末，民族资产阶级不会有今天的地位，我国社会主义革命的历史也将从头再写。但有人口里承认领导，实际上用各种诡辩来否定工人阶级的领导。令人遗憾的是我会的章乃器副主委最近在报上和“工商界”月刊第六期上所发表的文章，正是在争鸣的掩饰下，贩运资本主义思想的突出的典型。他说：“历史上领导者与被领导者的区别，都只能是先进与落后的区别。”这就是说，领导与被领导者之间，只能是先进的分子领导落后的分子，并没有阶级的区别存在；也就是说，并没有一个阶级领导另一阶级的问题存在。这不仅否定了今天工人阶级的领导，而且从根本上否定了社会阶级的存在。
    二、我们说，两面性是民族资产阶级的特点。有了两面性中积极的一面，民族资产阶级才有参加新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的可能，才有走和平道路的可能。两面性的性质是随着时代的变化而变化的。从两面性的变化来说，今日所谓两面性，主要是社会主义的一面与资本主义的一面。高潮以后的两面性与高潮以前的两面性有很大的不同，并且正在不断的变化中，今后的两面性与现在的两面性也必然又有所不同。总的趋势是社会主义的一面在继续增长，而资本主义的一面在继续缩小。但因为资本主义的一面还没有完全消灭，所以我们工商业者还需要继续改造，任何放松改造的想法和做法都是不对的。当然，工人也有缺点，也要改造，毛主席说过，“谁说工人不要改造？”但因为工人是被剥削的阶级，他没有留恋资本主义的思想，因而工人的改造与工商界的改造是根本不同的。有人说：“什么阶级，什么人都有两面性，都需要改造。”这是把工人阶级与民族资产阶级混淆起来的说法，是完全错误的。
    三、有人认为定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入，这是怪论。国家每年支付的定息，都是工人阶级劳动的产物。一方面，民族资产阶级既然不劳而获，同时工人阶级就必然劳而不获（我同意吴大琨的说法）。不劳而获的收入与剥削收入是同一性质的东西。但正因为有人把定息看作是不劳而获的收入，好比是天上掉下来的东西，因而要求把定息延长到二十年。同时，还希望国家把二十年定息一次付清，以便摘掉资本家帽子。这种名利双收的想法，是十足的资产阶级的思想，凡是真心诚意接受社会主义改造，把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动的人，反对这种想法，也是很自然的。
    资产阶级同工人阶级确是两个胎，两付骨。
    前面我说过，工商业者在工作上、生活上碰到困难的时候，是容易产生消极情绪的，我们应该帮助工商业者解决工作上、生活上的困难，以便于发挥积极作用。我应该说明，这并不是要工商业者把一切责任推给客观的存在。恰恰相反，我们工商界必须加强主观努力，提高政治责任感，主动地发挥社会主义积极性。在公私合营企业中，我们一方面要求有职有权，要求公方和职工的尊重和支持，但同时，我们也必须守职尽责，主动地靠拢公方和职工群众，积极贡献出知识和才能，逐步改变职工群众对我们的观感。
    大家知道，工商业者的个人改造应该以企业为基地，在工作实践中努力改造自己成为名副其实的劳动者。有些人认为自己已经很进步，听到还要改造，就感到不服气。我认为，工商业者中间各人的进步是不平衡的，有进步的，有中间的，也还有落后的。进步是没有止境的，进步的人不仅应该继续进步，还应该帮助别人进步。有人对脱胎换骨害怕，认为有无穷的忧虑。我认为，资产阶级同工人阶级就阶级本质来说，确是两个胎，两付骨。从资产阶级分子变为工人阶级分子，就必须脱资本主义的胎，换社会主义的骨。目前工商界社会主义的一面正在增长，资本主义的一面正在缩小，最后归于消灭，这就是脱胎换骨的过程。大家都在脱、都在换，到了已经脱了换了那一天，谁要叫你再脱再换呢？为什么会有无穷忧虑呢？
    一切用主观主义反对主观主义，用官僚主义反对官僚主义，用教条主义甚至修正主义反对教条主义的做法，都是不应该的。
    我们帮助党进行整风，是为了正确地处理人民内部的矛盾。我们所采取的办法是团结、批评、团结；而我们的目的是为了加强党的领导，加强社会主义一致性，也就是为了更好地建设社会主义。百花齐放，百家争鸣，既然是处理人民内部矛盾的好方法，我们就不仅要“放”，而且要齐“放”；不仅要“鸣”，而且要争“鸣”。为的是明辨是非，共同进步，我们还应该平心静气，实事求是地交换意见。我批评别人，是为了帮助别人进步；别人批评我，也是为了帮助我进步。我们大家在社会主义一致的基础上团结起来，目标是一致的，不同的意见是可以经过讨论，逐步求得一致的。一切用主观主义来反对主观主义，用官僚主义来反对官僚主义，用教条主义甚至修正主义来反对教条主义的做法，都是不应该的。揭发矛盾，反对“三害”，是为了提高马克思列宁主义的思想认识，进一步加强中国共产党的领导，增进全国人民的团结，而不是为了其他。由于党能够一贯地对错误作斗争，及时纠正错误，因而我们的党是正确的，光荣的，伟大的。这次声势浩大的整风运动，就是一个很好的例子。
          三点建议
    最后，根据这次座谈会上反映出来的问题，我想提出三点建议：
    第一，座谈会上有很多人提出，应该进一步对职工、公方和私方三方面加强政治思想教育，这是完全必要的。我认为，工商业者为了改造自己，应该进一步加强学习，提高社会主义觉悟；对于公方和职工，也同样应该不断地进行政治思想教育，尤其是关于统战政策的教育。而且要教育他们，对于私方人员的变化和积极性，要有足够的认识和估价。管理社会主义企业是一件新的工作，工商业者不能因为自己有一定的业务技术知识而自高自大。恰巧相反，他们仍然应该向职工和公方学习并加强业务学习，提高技能，提高政治觉悟。至于业务和技术水平比较低的私方人员，自然更应该加强学习。对于公方来说，缺乏业务知识是比较普遍的现象，应该积极响应党的号召，随时随地向群众学习，而且要向私方学习，使自己在业务上成为内行。
    第二，建立和健全企业管理委员会。
    有些企业已建立管理委员会，但不够健全；有的还没有建立起来，应该作为一种制度，明定章程，使大家能够职责分明，照章办事。这个章程，听说现在由总工会在那里摸经验。我认为，应该以总工会为主，加入企业部门，并邀民建及工商联参加，共同讨论。
    章程是可以修改的，可否定下章程，先行试办，取得经验，再作进一步的修改。
    第三，工商座谈会。
    工商座谈会是交换意见、协调公私关系，改进企业工作的良好办法。陈云副总理曾指示过，各地要把工商座谈会作为一种经常性的制度。据了解，不少大城市是举行了的，但没有经常化。有的中小城市根本没有举行过。我认为，工商座谈会和企业管理委员会一样，应该制度化。可否由中央工商行政管理局主持，由民建会和工商联参加，拟订出一个组织章程之类的东西，以便各地推行，大家遵守。工商座谈会不能形式化，而应该有具体内容。开会前要做好准备，以便真正能解决问题，每次开会除有关业务部门参加外，希望各地统战部参加。
