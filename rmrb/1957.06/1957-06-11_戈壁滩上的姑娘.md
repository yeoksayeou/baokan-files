　　A Girl on the Gobi Desert
　　Xiao Youli
　　This happened in July of last year: A female surveying team in the Qaidam Basin ran into trouble.
　　One morning, the team leader, Chu Zhenshu, was about to set off with the girls and two surveyors when the cook, Old Zhao, stopped her and said, "Captain, we only have five days' worth of water and food left. What should we do?" Chu Zhenshu knew that it would take the camels four days to go to and return from the brigade headquarters. She said, "Send the camel team to the brigade headquarters immediately." The camel team was quite tired from moving the tents, but there was no other choice.
　　The fourth day was when the camel team was supposed to return, but they waited and waited, until it was dark. The surroundings were as silent as a pool of stagnant water, and they couldn't even hear the sound of the camel bells.
　　The fifth day came and went without a trace….
　　On the sixth day, there was no water and no food. People who have been to the Gobi Desert know that in that desolate place, cars can travel for three days, five days, or even three months, five months, without seeing a single human footprint. Not even birds or wild grass can be found. In short, there is not a trace of life. The arid Gobi Desert is boundless, and water is as precious as pearls, and like food, it must be transported from far, far away. On this day, the girls ate a half-full meal and still went to work, always thinking on the bright side: "The camel team might have encountered something on the difficult Gobi Desert that delayed them for two days. They will bring food and water today!"
　　At noon, the camel team still hadn't arrived. The first to get anxious was the cook, Old Zhao. In the tent, he wrung his hands in anxiety. Finally, he took out the few flour sacks and shook them, managing to shake out a little powder. He also turned over the water buckets, basins, and pots, and managed to drip out a little water after a long time. As the saying goes, "Even a clever woman can't cook without rice." Old Zhao tried every means, even taking out the starter dough, but he could only make seven steamed buns.
　　There were nine people in the team. How could they share these seven steamed buns? This stumped Old Zhao. He had no choice but to put the buns in a satchel and run to the work site to give them to Captain Chu Zhenshu. Chu Zhenshu asked, "Old Zhao, have you eaten?"
　　Old Zhao quickly replied, "Yes." But in reality, he hadn't eaten at all. Chu Zhenshu then said to the girls, "The two surveyors carry the measuring rods and instruments, and their legs run more and get more tired and hungry than ours. My suggestion is to give them two buns each." The girls didn't say anything and all nodded in agreement. What about the remaining three? The six of them would each share half a bun.
　　At night, the desolate Gobi Desert was a dark expanse, with nothing to be seen except the crescent moon and dim stars accompanying them in the sky. In the tent, Captain Chu Zhenshu smoothed her soft, short hair, and her deep and moving eyes gazed at each girl. She gave the order: "Tomorrow, you will be led by Little Fang to return to the brigade headquarters. Old Zhao and I will stay here to watch the tents."
　　The next day, before the sun had risen, the girls took their binoculars and compass, and packed a few daily necessities into their pockets, and set off for the brigade headquarters. They walked and walked, hungry and thirsty, even eating the only thing they could eat—toothpaste. They put all their strength into moving forward, and the sun was about to set. Suddenly, in the distance, they spotted two white tents shining with golden light in the evening glow through their binoculars. There was hope! They mustered their energy and rushed towards the tents, only to find that it wasn't the brigade headquarters, but the campsite of another general survey team. It turned out that they had walked for a whole day on this desolate Gobi Desert, only covering twenty-some kilometers, and it was still fifty-some kilometers to the brigade headquarters.
　　After eating and drinking at the general survey team's campsite, they were driven back to their own brigade headquarters overnight by the general survey team's gasoline truck. At the brigade headquarters, they learned that the camel team had arrived at the brigade headquarters on the same day and had transported the water and food on the same day. Why hadn't it arrived after six days? It was later learned that the camel team had circled around the tents for two days within a three-kilometer radius before finding them. Because in that desolate Gobi Desert, there had been no roads for thousands of years, and even human footprints were rare. These girls' footprints were the first to appear here since the beginning of time, and they used their feet to tread out a path for future generations.

### 戈壁滩上的姑娘

　　戈壁滩上的姑娘
　　萧有立
    这是去年7月间的事情：在柴达木盆地的一支女子测量队，发生问题了。
    这一天早晨，队长楚贞淑带着姑娘们，还有两个测工，正要出发，炊事员老赵拦住她说：“队长，现在只剩下五天的水和粮食了，怎办？”楚贞淑知道，骆驼到大队部去，来回要四天的工夫，她便说：“马上就派驼队到大队部去。”驼队刚搬了帐篷是挺累的，可是，也没有别的办法。
    第四天，是驼队应该回来的时候了，可是，他们望眼欲穿，等呀，等呀，一直等到天黑，四野静寂得像一池死水一样，连一点儿骆驼的铃铛声也听不到。
    第五天，仍然无影无纵……。
    第六天，水没有了，粮食没有了。到过戈壁滩的人们都知道，在那荒无人烟的戈壁滩上，汽车可以跑个三天、五天、甚至是三月、五月，都会见不到人的足迹，就连飞鸟，野草也见不到，总之，连一点儿生命的痕迹也没有。干旱的戈壁滩上，一望无际，水更是像珍珠般的宝贵，和粮食一样，都必须从挺远挺远的地方运来。这一天，姑娘们吃了个半饱，仍然出工，她们总是往好的方面想：“驼队或许是在难行的戈壁滩上碰到什么事情，耽误了两天，今天会把粮食和水运来的！”
    晌午了，驼队仍然没有来，第一个着急的是炊事员老赵。在帐篷里，他急得搓手顿脚，最后，他把几个面袋都拿出来，抖了抖，费尽好大的力气才抖出了一点粉末。他又把水桶、盆、锅都翻过来，滴了好半天才滴出一点儿水。常言说：“巧妇难为无米之炊。”老赵想尽了办法，连发面头也拿出来做了，也只能做出七个馒头。
    小队共有九个人，怎么来吃这七个馒头呢？这一下可把老赵难住了。他只好把馒头装到挂包里，跑到工作的地点，交给队长楚贞淑。楚贞淑问：“老赵，你吃了没有？
  “老赵很快地回答说：“吃了”。其实，他哪里吃了呢？楚贞淑又对着姑娘们说：“两位测工扛标尺、背仪器，两条腿跑得比我们多，比我们累，也比我们饿，我的意见是，他们俩个每人给两个馒头。”姑娘们没有吭声，都点头同意。剩下的三个呢？他们六个人，一人分半个吃。
    夜晚，荒凉的戈壁滩上，黑糊糊的一片，什么也见不到，只有天上的残月和不很明亮的星星陪伴着她们。帐篷里，队长楚贞淑理了理她那柔软的短发，一对深沉而又动人的眼睛，注视着每个姑娘，她下命令了：“明天，你们由小芳带队，回大队部去，我和老赵留在这里看帐篷。”
    第二天，太阳还没升起，姑娘们拿了望远镜、罗盘，还把几样日常用品装到口袋里，向大队部出发了。走呀，走呀，她们又饥又渴，把唯一能吃的牙膏也吃下去了，用尽力气迈步前进，眼看着太阳就要落山了。忽然，望远镜里发现远远的地方，出现了两顶白色的帐篷，在晚霞中闪着金光。有希望了！她们鼓起劲头，奔向帐篷一看，这还不是大队部哩，而是另一个普查大队的营地。原来她们在这荒凉的戈壁滩上，走了整整一天，才只走了二十几公里，到大队部还有五十几公里呢。
    在普查大队，她们吃了、喝了之后，便由普查大队的嘎士车，连夜把她们送回自己的大队部。在大队部，她们才知道，驼队当天到大队部，当天就把水和粮食运走了。为什么六天了，还没有运到呢？据后来了解，驼队在距离帐篷仅仅三公里的周围，盘旋了两天才找到帐篷。因为在那荒凉的戈壁滩上，不但千万年来没有路，就连人的足迹也没有过，而这些姑娘们的足迹还是开天辟地以来第一次在这儿出现，她们就这样用自己的脚给后代人踏出路来。
