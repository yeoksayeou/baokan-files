Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: The National Propaganda Work Conference of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, which began in Beijing on May 28th, concluded today.

The conference believes that the main contradiction existing in the current work is that the leadership at all levels of the association lags behind the reality, and the quantity and quality of scientific and technological knowledge popularized by the association cannot meet the needs of the people. The main reason for this is that the enthusiasm of the association members has not been fully utilized.

The conference pointed out: The current main tasks of the association are: under the leadership of the Party, to strengthen the leadership of the association system, give play to the enthusiasm of members, help grassroots organizations actively carry out propaganda work, provide propaganda materials in a timely manner, and strengthen the work of study groups to improve the quality of propaganda.

At the meeting, everyone had a debate on the nature of the association. Most people believed that the association is a mass organization voluntarily organized by scientific and technological workers, therefore, scientific and technological workers, under the leadership of the Party, can only do a good job in popular science work by promoting the spirit of being masters of their own affairs. When talking about how to give play to the enthusiasm of scientific and technological workers at the meeting, everyone believed that it is currently necessary to strengthen the leadership of the standing committees at all levels of the association.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave instructions at the meeting tonight. He emphasized the significant role of popular science and technology work in the cultural and technological revolution.

    发挥会员的积极性提高宣传质量
    全国科普宣传工作会议闭幕
    据新华社4日讯　从5月28日开始在北京举行的中华全国科学技术普及协会全国宣传工作会议今天闭幕。
    会议认为，目前工作中存在的主要矛盾是：协会的各级领导落后于实际，协会所普及的科学技术知识的数量和质量还不能满足人民的需要。其主要原因，就是还没有充分发挥协会会员的积极性。
    会议指出：当前协会的主要任务：在党的领导下，加强对协会系统的领导，发挥会员的积极性，帮助基层组织主动地开展宣传工作及时供应宣传资料，并加强学组工作以此提高宣传质量。
    会上，大家曾就协会的性质问题展开了争论，大多数人认为：协会是科学技术工作者自愿组织起来的群众团体，因此科学技术工作者在党的领导下，发扬当家做主的精神，才能搞好科普工作。会上谈到如何发挥科学技术工作者的积极性时，大家认为目前首先要加强协会各级常委会的领导。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬今晚在会上作了指示。他强调说明了科学技术普及工作在文化技术革命中的重大作用。
