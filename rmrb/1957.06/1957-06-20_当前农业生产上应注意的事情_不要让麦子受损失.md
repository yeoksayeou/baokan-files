Matters Needing Attention in Current Agricultural Production
　　Don't Let the Wheat Suffer Losses
Last year, the wheat was very good in some areas, but losses were significant. The reasons for the losses included the early arrival of the flood season and continuous rainfall, but also, and to a great extent, the subjective and bureaucratic work style of cadres who forced the masses to rush the harvest in the rain, even harvesting unripe wheat. In addition, after collectivization, the dispersed management was changed to collective management, but the threshing grounds were not appropriately expanded to adapt to the changing situation, resulting in too many wheat stacks on the grounds, and poor stacking, which prolonged the threshing time and caused a lot of wheat to rot. These lessons must be remembered this year.
Because of differences in terrain, soil quality, and the many varieties of wheat, the maturity period of wheat is extremely uneven. The leadership of agricultural cooperatives must listen to the opinions of the masses and consult with them, and, based on different conditions such as soil, harvest separately according to local conditions, ensuring that harvesting occurs when the wheat is ripe, and avoiding harvesting unripe wheat or harvesting in the rain, strictly preventing subjectivism from happening again.
After the wheat is brought home, it should be stacked in a timely manner. Generally, large and high stacks should be built (when stacking, the wheat should be spread out, not stacked in bundles). It is best to dig small ditches around the stacks to prevent excessive rain from leaking in and causing the wheat to rot. In areas lacking livestock, there is a significant contradiction between quick threshing and insufficient animal power, making it even more important to stack the wheat well and extend the threshing period (which will actually have to be extended). Of course, it is possible to call on people to pull rollers to compensate for the lack of animal power, but this is a difficult task, and it is indeed beyond human capabilities; at the same time, poorly threshed wheat stalks are also very unfavorable for raising livestock. Small threshing grounds are no longer suitable and must be expanded to facilitate rapid and large-scale threshing.
In order to avoid mold and rot due to the concentration of wheat after threshing, and while ensuring the completion of public grain and unified purchase tasks, agricultural cooperatives should prepare a pre-distribution plan in advance, so that distribution occurs with threshing. This will not only prevent the wheat from rotting, but also effectively prevent corruption.

### 当前农业生产上应注意的事情  不要让麦子受损失

　　当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    不要让麦子受损失
    去年一些地区麦子很好，但损失很大。所以造成损失，除汛期到来较早且阴雨连绵外，干部有主观主义官僚主义的思想作风，迫使群众雨天抢收，不熟也收，也是一个很大原因。另外合作化以后，分散的经营改为集体经营，打麦的场未能随着情况的变化而适当扩大，形成场小麦垛多，而且垛得不好，致拖长了打麦时间，沤了不少麦子。这些教训今年必须记取。
    因为地势高低和土质的不同，加以小麦品种很多，所以麦子成熟期极不平衡。农业社的领导方面必须听取群众意见，和群众商量，依据土壤等不同情况，因地制宜的分别收割，作到熟了即收，不熟和雨天不收，严防主观主义再次发生。
    麦子收到家以后，应及时垛起。一般要垛大垛，垛高垛（垛时应将麦子撒开，不要成捆垛起），垛的周围最好挖小沟，以免霪雨过多漏雨沤坏麦子。在缺乏牲口的地方，快打与畜力不足矛盾是很大的，这样更应将麦垛垛好，打麦期限予以延长（实际也得延长）。因畜力不足用人拉磙当然可以号召，但毕竟是一个艰苦工作，确非人力所能胜任；同时麦秸碾得不好，对饲养牲畜也是很不利。目前小的麦场已不适用，必须进行扩大，以有利于迅速大量打麦。
    为避免打后麦子因集中发生霉烂现象，在注意公粮、统购任务完成的前提下，农业社内应事前订好预分计划，作到随打随分。这不仅可以避免麦子霉烂，而且也可以有效的防止贪污现象的发生。
