Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - Vientiane dispatch: "Peace" Weekly, the organ of the Lao Committee for Upholding Peace and Neutrality Policy, recently published many letters from readers expressing support for the policy of peace and neutrality, advocating that negotiations must be held with the Lao Patriotic Forces, and opposing the formation of a cabinet by Katay Don Sasorith.

　　A group of monks, in a letter to "Peace" Weekly, said: "Our country needs peace and neutrality, but the United States is unwilling, and our Mr. (Katay Don Sasorith) is following the United States, hindering the realization of the policy of peace and neutrality."

　　A group of civil servants from Vientiane Province, in a letter to "Peace" Weekly, expressed concern that Sasorith's coming to power would cause the war to break out again.

　　According to a report in the June 10th issue of "Peace" Weekly, the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Forces, which is negotiating with the Lao Kingdom Government in Vientiane, wrote to the Lao Kingdom Government delegation, the National Assembly, and the International Commission on June 8th, protesting the Lao Ministry of Interior's attempt to illegally monitor the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Forces.

　　The protest letter said: "On June 6th, Minister of Interior Ngon Sananikone sent an official letter No. '466', saying that he would prohibit the Lao Patriotic Forces delegation from leaving their residence; at the same time, without the permission of the Ministry of Interior or the police station, no outsiders would be allowed to go to the residence of the Lao Patriotic Forces delegation."

　　The letter said: "Ngon Sananikone is actually carrying out the instructions of Mr. Katay, who is currently forming a cabinet. At a meeting of the National Party, Mr. Katay said that he had instructed Mr. Ngon to keep the 'Lao elements' in Pak-Pasak (Xinhua editor's note: this is the residence of the Lao Patriotic Forces delegation) under surveillance." "In this way, Mr. Katay has made it clear that if he forms a government, he will undermine negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Forces, not implement the resolutions, and adopt methods of armed suppression and arrest to solve the problem of the Lao Patriotic Forces."

　　The letter emphasized that Ngon's actions violated the Xieng Khouang decision signed on March 10, 1955. This decision stipulated: "During the time of stationing in Vientiane, the Kingdom side will guarantee the Lao Patriotic Forces residence, guarantee safety and freedom of movement, and provide convenience for traveling in the city and contacting Sam Neua."

　　拥护和平中立　反对再打内战
　　老挝公众主张同寮国部队谈判
　　寮方代表团抗议王国政府非法监视
    据新华社河内16日电　万象消息：老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会机关报“和平”周刊最近发表许多读者的来信，表示拥护和平中立政策，主张必须同寮国战斗部队谈判，并且反对卡代·萨索里特组阁。
    一群僧侣在写给“和平”周刊的一封信中说：“我国需要和平中立，可是美国不愿意，而我们的（卡代·萨索里特）先生也尾随美国之后，阻挠和平中立政策的实现。”
    一群万象省的公务员等在写给“和平”周刊的一封信中，表示担心萨索里特上台执政将使战争重新爆发。
    另据6月10日的“和平”周刊报道，正在万象同老挝王国政府进行谈判的寮国战斗部队代表团，6月8日写信给老挝王国政府代表团、国会和国际委员会，抗议老挝内政部企图对寮国战斗部队代表团进行非法监视。
    这封抗议信说：“6月6日，内政大臣努义·阿布海寄来一件‘四六六号’公函，说要禁止寮国战斗部队代表团离开住所；同时，如果未经内政部或警察局的许可，不准任何外人到寮国战斗部队代表团的住所去。”
    这封信说：“努义·阿布海实际上是执行了目前出来组阁的卡代先生的指示。在国家党的会议上，卡代先生说他已经指示努义先生在巴克—巴沙克（新华社编者按：这是寮国战斗部队代表团的住地）把‘寮国分子’看管起来。”“这样，卡代先生又使人了解到，如果他成立了政府，他将破坏同寮国战斗部队的谈判，不执行各项决议，采取武力镇压和逮捕的办法来解决寮国战斗部队的问题。”
    信中强调指出，努义的行动违反了1955年3月10日签订的镇西高原决定。这项决定曾经规定：“在万象驻扎的时间里，王国方面将保证给予寮国战斗部队住所，保证安全和自由来往，并且给予在城市中来往和同桑怒联络的方便。”
