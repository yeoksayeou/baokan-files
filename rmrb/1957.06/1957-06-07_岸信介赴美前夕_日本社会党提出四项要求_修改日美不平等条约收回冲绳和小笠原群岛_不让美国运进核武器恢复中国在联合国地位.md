Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: On June 5th, the Japan Socialist Party submitted four demands to the Japanese Prime Minister, Kishi Nobusuke, to be presented to the United States government. These four demands are: First, revise the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty; second, guarantee that nuclear weapons will not be brought into Japan; third, return the Ogasawara Islands and Okinawa Island occupied by the United States; and fourth, support China's restoration of its representation in the United Nations.

Kishi Nobusuke, who recently concluded his visit to Southeast Asian countries, will visit the United States in mid-June.

Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out in a speech last night that Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia was clearly a failure. He said that Kishi Nobusuke's plan to rely on U.S. "aid" to establish an Asian Development Fund, which he proposed to Southeast Asian countries, was not immediately accepted because he ignored the reality of Asia and excluded a major country like China from this plan.

Suzuki said that the focus of Kishi Nobusuke's visit to Southeast Asia was India, but he did not reach agreement with Prime Minister Nehru on issues such as military blocs, recognition of China, a registration system for nuclear weapons testing, U.S. "aid," and independent neutral diplomacy. Suzuki pointed out that this divergence was expected because Kishi Nobusuke advocated peace on the one hand, but carried gunpowder on his back on the other. He must first put down the gunpowder on his back.

Suzuki also expressed concern that Kishi Nobusuke would bring nuclear weapons into Japan after visiting the United States. He demanded that Kishi Nobusuke explicitly express his opposition to bringing nuclear weapons into Japan during his visit to the United States.

Suzuki also accused Kishi Nobusuke's attempt to mediate the contradictions between Britain and the United States on the embargo issue as "ridiculous."

    岸信介赴美前夕
    日本社会党提出四项要求
    修改日美不平等条约收回冲绳和小笠原群岛  不让美国运进核武器恢复中国在联合国地位
    新华社6日电　东京消息：日本社会党6月5日把四项向美国政府提出的要求提交给日本首相岸信介。这四项要求是：一，修改日美安全条约；二，保证不把核武器运进日本；三，归还美国占领的小笠原群岛和冲绳岛；四，支持中国恢复它在联合国中的代表权。
    最近结束了对东南亚国家的访问的岸信介将在本月中旬访问美国。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎昨天晚上发表谈话指出，岸信介的东南亚之行显然是一场失败。他说，岸信介向东南亚国家提出的关于依靠美国“援助”来建立亚洲开发基金的计划，并没有被立即接受，因为他忽视了亚洲的现实，把中国这样一个大国排斥在这个计划之外。
    铃木说，岸信介访问东南亚的重点国家是印度，但是他在军事集团、承认中国、核武器试验的登记制度、美国“援助”和独立的中立外交等问题上，都没有同尼赫鲁总理取得一致意见。铃木指出，这种分歧是在预料之内的，因为岸信介一方面主张和平，而另一方面却背着火药。他必须首先放下他背上的火药。
    铃木并且表示担心岸信介在访问美国以后将把核武器带进日本。他要求岸信介在访问美国的时候明确地表示反对把核武器带进日本。
    铃木还指责岸信介关于调停英、美两国在禁运问题上的矛盾的企图是“可笑的”。
