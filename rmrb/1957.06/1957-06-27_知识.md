　　“Knowledge”
　　Zhang Hua
    More than thirty years ago, why were Cao Rulin and Lu Zongyu beaten in Beijing? What were the Twenty-One Demands signed by Yuan Shikai with Japan and Chiang Kai-shek's "non-resistance policy"?
  What did the "Four Big Families" do? This isn't particularly profound historical knowledge; those who have read a few years of books, even many illiterate "old rustics," could answer.
    However, that right-wing intellectual knew nothing about it and therefore made statements like this in public: "Without the Communist Party's leadership, people still wouldn't sell out the country."
    It's been almost eight years since liberation. In the past, people ate chaff and vegetable leaves, and sold their children; now their bellies are full, and not only full, but they also want to buy some pork. With so many people wanting to buy, they have to line up. Is this a decrease or an increase in the people's living standards? This isn't particularly profound knowledge either; those who pay attention to national affairs, even illiterate "old rustics," could answer.
    However, that right-wing intellectual knew nothing about it and therefore said: "This is a decrease in living standards."
    The rectification movement has just begun, only a few big-character posters have been put up in the organs, and the problems existing in various places have not been fully revealed. No one can know how many Communist Party members across the country are committing sectarianism.
    However, that right-wing intellectual had already calculated the statistics and announced: "Now 90-some percent of the party members are engaging in sectarianism, even committing all kinds of evil."
    What he should know, he doesn't; what he shouldn't know, he thinks he knows.
    How should we define the "knowledge" of "right-wing intellectuals"?

### “知识”

　　“知识”
　　张化
    三十多年前，曹汝霖、陆宗舆在北京为什么要挨揍？袁世凯和日本签订的二十一条和蒋介石的“不抵抗主义”是什么东西？
  “四大家族”是干什么的？这并不是怎样深奥的历史知识，那些读过几年书的，甚至许多目不识丁的“老粗”也会答得出来。
    然而，那位右派高级知识分子却一点也不知道，因而在大庭广众之中发表这样的言论：“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”。
    解放快八年了。过去吃糠咽菜，鬻儿卖女的，现在肚子吃饱了，不但吃饱，还要买点猪肉；要买的人多了，不得不排队。这是人民生活水平降低呢，还是提高？这也不是怎样深奥的知识，留心国家大事的，甚至目不识丁的“老粗”也会答得出来。
    然而，那位右派高级知识分子却一点也不知道，因而说了句：“这是生活水平降低”。
    整风运动才开始，机关里大字报才贴出几张，各地存在的问题还没有全部摊开，谁也无法知道全国有多少共产党员犯宗派主义。
    然而，那位右派高级知识分子早已把统计数字都算出来了，并已公布：“现在党内有90％几的党员闹宗派，甚至无恶不作”。
    理应知道的，他无知；理应不知道的，他自以为知。
    应该怎样来给“右派高级知识分子”的知识下个定义呢？
