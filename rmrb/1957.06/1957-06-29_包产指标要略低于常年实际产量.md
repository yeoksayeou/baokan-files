　　Production Quota Targets Should Be Slightly Lower Than Normal Actual Output
    The "New Hunan Daily" published an editorial on the 22nd of this month entitled "Why Should Production Quota Targets Be Slightly Lower Than Normal Actual Output?" An excerpt follows:

    The main purpose of implementing production quotas in agricultural cooperatives is to encourage members to improve production more actively through the method of rewarding those who exceed the quotas. By adopting a method where the production quota target is slightly lower than the normal actual output, members will have hope of exceeding the quota, and their enthusiasm for production will increase. Conversely, if the production quota target exceeds the normal actual output, or even exceeds it by a large margin, members will feel there is no hope of exceeding the quota, and their enthusiasm for production will be affected. In the early stages of the agricultural cooperation movement, farmers' collectivist ideology was not yet consolidated, and they often thought: the agricultural cooperative is large, and if production increases, the amount allocated to me is just "mouse feed," thus reducing their enthusiasm for production. Adopting a method where the production quota target is slightly lower than the normal output, and most of the excess production is awarded to the production team, can closely combine the collective interests of the agricultural cooperative with the individual interests of the members, thereby benefiting the agricultural cooperative's increase in production and the members' increase in income.

    Allowing production quota targets to be appropriately lower than the normal actual output can not only better leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of the members, but also resolve the contradictions between poor and rich teams. In some agricultural cooperatives, some teams originally had higher yields. If these cooperatives set the production quota targets higher than the normal actual output, it would be difficult for the teams to exceed the quota, which would inevitably lead to leveling out the distribution across the cooperative. As a result, members in the rich teams would suffer losses and become dissatisfied, creating opposition between the rich and poor teams. Making the production quota target lower than the normal actual output, and giving appropriate consideration to the rich teams in the production quota target, is one of the ways to solve this problem.

    Affirmatively speaking, a production quota target slightly lower than the normal actual output is better than a high one. However, it should not be too low. We know that after farmers join agricultural cooperatives, most of their income should be distributed from the cooperative. If the production quota target is much lower than the normal actual output, the income that members receive from the team will be greater than the income they receive from the cooperative. This will foster serious "localism" within the team, disregarding the collective production of the entire cooperative. So how much lower should it be? It is difficult to say for sure. Moreover, the situations of each cooperative are different, and it is not possible to rigidly apply a single number. From the cooperatives that have already done this, the target is generally 5% to 10% lower than the normal actual output. This number can be used as a reference.

### 包产指标要略低于常年实际产量

　　包产指标要略低于常年实际产量
    本月22日新湖南报发表了题为“为什么包产指标要略低于常年实际产量？”的社论，摘要如下：
    农业社所以要实行包产，其主要目的就是为了通过超产可以得到奖励的办法，来鼓励社员更积极的搞好生产。采取包产指标略低于常年实际产量的办法，社员超产有望，生产积极性就会高涨。反之，包产指标超过常年实际产量，甚至超过很远，社员认为超产无希望，生产积极性就会受到影响。在农业合作化运动的初期，农民的集体主义思想还不巩固，他们往往认为：农业社家大业大，增了产，分到我名下也不过是“耗子粮”，因而生产积极性不高。采取包产指标略低于常年产量，超产部分大部分奖给生产队的办法，就可以把农业社的集体利益和社员的个人利益紧密结合起来，从而有利于农业社增加生产，社员增加收入。
    让包产指标适当低于常年实际产量，不仅可以更好的发挥社员的积极性和创造性，而且也可以解决穷队与富队之间的矛盾。有些农业社，有的队原来产量比较高，如果这些社里把包产指标定得高于常年实际产量，队里很难超产，势必造成全社拉平分配。结果是富队里的社员吃了亏，不满意，造成了富队与穷队的对立。使包产指标低于常年实际产量，在包产指标上给富队以适当照顾，正是解决这个问题的办法之一。
    肯定的说，包产指标略低于常年实际产量比高了好。但是，也不能低得太多。我们知道，农民在加入农业社以后，收入的大部分应该从社里分得。如果包产指标比常年实际产量低得过多，社员们从队里得到的收入多于在社里得到的收入，这样队里就会滋长严重的“本位主义”，不顾全社的集体生产。那末究竟以低多少为宜呢？这一点很难肯定。加上各社的情况又不同，不能硬套某一个数字。从现在已经这样作的社来看，一般比常年实际产量低5％到10％，这个数字可作参考。
