　　Good Example
　　Dongguo Diji
    The rectification movement has just begun, and the revealed problems are numerous and serious, and the opinions raised are sharp and intense; even to the point that some leaders may find it difficult to accept for a while, which is inevitable. Because at the beginning, without exposing and criticizing, there would be no way to rectify, and it would be impossible to change course.
    However, I still believe that thorough exposure is a good start; after several gentle breezes and drizzles, there will be a clear and bright scene. This situation is naturally not very common at present; after a while, I think, good news will come, and it will be as if one is on the Shanyin Road, with too much to take in. There is no need to doubt this, since the Party has decided to carry out rectification, it can resolutely distinguish right from wrong, solve problems, and clarify ideological confusion.
    However, the development of events sometimes moves faster than Apo's golden chariot, and we must not close our eyes to reality; that is to say, even though the rectification movement has just begun, good examples have already emerged. Looking at good examples will naturally eliminate negative and pessimistic psychology and further encourage confidence in the rectification.
    The progress of the rectification movement in the Shanghai People's Art Theater is sufficient to illustrate the problem. Shanghai newspapers published their three letters and some specific measures, indicating that their rectification has achieved initial results.
    The first letter is a joint letter from Danny and more than one hundred others. The letter not only delicately wrote about their complex thoughts of excitement, heaviness, blame, expectation... intertwined, but also proposed: if we can understand each other more, it will be of great benefit to doing a good job in the movement. … We need to always be open and honest with each other, and share weal and woe. More straightforwardly, they hoped that their leaders would have: broader minds, happier moods,... They trust the open and aboveboard Party, so they trust their leaders; conversely, they also hope that their leaders can trust the masses. Particularly touching is that: they deeply appreciate the complex and intense self-struggle mood of the leaders, kindly hope that the leaders cherish their health, and earnestly care about their diet, sleep, and rest.
    The second and third letters are a reply letter from the leading cadres and a reply letter from the Party branch committee members. Here I only quote the words of Fang Xing, a member of the Party branch committee, who said: ... Now you care and trust us so much, but we used to distrust and not care about people so much. Now you are helping us solve ideological problems with such an attitude, but I used to often treat those who dared to criticize the leaders with crude and repressive methods. ... My actions and your letters can be said to be a "clear contrast, sharp criticism".... This is another aspect, from the perspective of leadership, showing sincere, frank, and profound, humble true feelings and true words, which will enable them to thoroughly examine, resolve to improve, and plant roots in the depths of their minds.
    In addition, they also pointed out that in terms of leadership, in addition to continuing self-examination, they should sort out the problems that have been revealed, analyze the situation, and, in accordance with the spirit of "rectifying while correcting," make preliminary reforms to certain work that can be improved. At the same time, under the requirement that both rectification and work should not be neglected, some actors have been performing four repertoires in rotation in two theaters; and they are also intensively rehearsing two new repertoires, preparing to meet the audience in June and on "August 1st."
    Naturally, these turning points in the Shanghai People's Art Theater are only preliminary achievements; what will happen in the future remains to be seen. But they are advancing following a law, that is, starting from unity, through strict criticism, to achieve the goal of unity. This is precisely what the Party has repeatedly instructed, and through their specific facts, it has indeed achieved practical results.
    The Shanghai People's Art Theater can become a good example. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, attaches importance to literary and artistic work, personally takes action, and supports "letting go" and "contending." The thorough exposure and courageous criticism of the staff in the theater are certainly necessary factors, but perhaps the key lies in their leadership. After all, these leaders once unyieldingly persisted in the struggle in the reactionary dark era; after liberation, they also worked selflessly and made contributions to the Party's cause. They have a foundation, and they can more quickly improve their ideological awareness.
    If we go back to the topic, the ideological awareness of the leaders of some agencies and some groups may not be very high, and in the middle of the rectification, they always adopt a shy attitude towards criticism and cannot turn their minds around for a while. This requires more help from all parties.
    I use real examples to point out that good examples have begun to emerge, which is certainly to congratulate those brave people who are sincerely rectifying with an unstoppable mood of joy; in fact, what is more important is to urge those units where the rectification movement has not been carried out sufficiently!

### 好的榜样

　　好的榜样
　　东郭迪吉
    整风运动刚刚开始，揭露的问题多而且严重，提出的意见尖锐而且激烈；甚之，足以使有些领导者一时难以接受得下去，这是必然的。因为乍开始，不揭露，不批评，就无从整起，也就无法改弦更张。
    可是，我还是相信能彻底揭发，就是良好的开端；经过几番和风细雨，紧接着就会呈现出天淡云闲，一派晴明的景象。这一情况，目前自然还不可能多；过一个时候，我想，好消息传来，定能如山阴道上，使人应接不暇。这原因用不到怀疑，党既能决定整风，就能决心分辨是非，解决问题，澄清思想上的混乱的。
    然而，事实的发展，有时会比阿坡雅的金马车奔驰的还快，我们也不要闭着眼睛看不见现实；这话就是说，即使是整风运动刚刚开始，也已经有好的榜样出现了。看看好的榜样，自会消除消极悲观心理，更会鼓舞整风信心。
    上海人民艺术剧院整风进展情况，足以说明问题。上海的报纸刊登了他们的三封信和一些具体措施，说明他们的整风是收到了初步的效果。
    第一封信是丹尼等一百余人的联名信，信上不但委婉的写出了他们的兴奋、沉重、责备、期望……参差交错的复杂的思想情况，也提出了：如果相互之间能多了解，对搞好运动会有很大好处。……需要永远肝胆相照，同甘共苦。更爽直的希望他们的领导们：胸襟更开阔，心情更愉快，……他们信任光明磊落的党，就信任他们的领导；反过来也希望他们的领导也能相信群众。特别感人心腑的是：他们深切的体会到领导人员的很复杂很激烈的自我斗争心情，亲切的希望领导人员珍重身体健康，殷殷的关切他们的饮食，睡眠和休息。
    第二、三封信，一是领导干部的复信，一是党支部委员的复信，这里我只引党支部委员方行信上的话，他说：……如今你们是这样的关心我们和信任我们，而我们过去却是那样的不信任人也不关心人。如今你们是以这样的态度来帮助我们解决思想问题，而我过去却往往是采取粗暴和压制的办法来对待敢于批评领导的人。……我的这些行为和你们的来信真可说是“鲜明的对照，尖锐的批评”……。这又是另一方面，从领导角度上，表现出真诚、坦率而且深刻、虚心的真情实话，这就会使之彻底检查、决心改进，在思想深处插下根苗。
    此外，他们还指出了在领导方面，除了继续进行自我检查外，对已经揭发出来的问题进行排队，分析情况，并根据“边整边改”的精神，对某些可以改进的工作作了初步的改革。同时，在整风、工作两不误的要求下，部分演员已分别在两个剧场轮换上演着四个剧目；并且紧张的排演着两个新的剧目，准备在6月和“八一”同观众见面。
    自然，上海人民艺术剧院这些转机，仅仅是初步的成就；今后如何，还得以观后效。但他们是遵循着一个规律前进的，就是从团结出发，通过严格的批评，达到团结的目的。这点，正是党反复的指示的，通过他们的具体的事实，确实的已经见诸实效了。
    上海人民艺术剧院可以成为好的榜样，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施重视文艺工作，亲自动手，支持了“放”“鸣”，院里工作人员彻底揭发，勇敢批评，固然都是必要的因素，恐怕关键所在，还在于他们的领导。这些领导人毕竟在反动黑暗时代，曾经不屈不挠坚持斗争；解放后，也曾经忘我的工作，对党的事业有过贡献。他们是有根基，他们更能迅速提高自己的思想觉悟。
    话如果再说回来，有些机关，有些团体，其领导人的思想觉悟未必多高，在整风中间，对于批评意见，总是采取羞羞答答的态度，脑子里一时转不过来。这就需要各方面更多地给予帮助。
    我以实在的事例，提出好的榜样已经开始出现，固然是以不能遏止的心情，欣喜的为那些诚心整风的勇者祝贺；其实，更重要的还在于对这些整风运动展开得不够的单位加以督促呵！
