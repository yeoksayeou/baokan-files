Shanghai dispatch from our newspaper: Some members of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League have recently launched sharp criticisms in several symposiums against the erroneous remarks of Chen Renbing, the vice chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, believing that his recent arguments such as "settling old scores" are connected with some of the anti-socialist arguments of some people in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League.

Chen Renbing's erroneous remarks were mainly manifested in his written speech at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Conference. The main contents of this speech are roughly as follows: He advocated that every grassroots level should be allowed to "speak out," saying that "the major problem at present is still how to encourage the masses at all grassroots levels to break through all worries and speak out and release in every corner, especially in many dead corners." He said that he felt "what he has heard these days is probably only one-thousandth or ten-thousandth of what should be spoken out and released in every corner of Shanghai." He said that after hearing the contradictions revealed at the meeting, he "felt very heavy and sad. In the Han Dynasty, there was a man named Jia Yi. Jia Yi once presented an article to the emperor at that time, called 'Security Policy.' In today's language, it talked about the internal contradictions of the social politics at that time. Jia Yi lined up his materials, those few were tearful, those few were moving, those few were sighing, and there were those few that made people feel very unreasonable." He said that he also lined up the situations he heard, and the conclusion was "I dare not say that there are things that make people cry, but at least, there are probably too many things that make us sigh." Therefore, he suggested that "in the rectification, we should focus on encouraging people to discover shortcomings and mistakes, and never put the hat of 'erasing past achievements' on people's heads." He also suggested that in this rectification, "pick out a few people who the masses think have significant mistakes and conduct effective and fair education and handling, which will be more persuasive and mobilizing than a few editorials in the Liberation Daily." He also said: "I think that in the process of checking shortcomings, distinguishing right from wrong, and correcting mistakes, old scores cannot be settled. Some comrades who have made mistakes like to use opposing the settling of old scores to cover up their own mistakes." He said: "The principle of treating illnesses to save people, which Chairman Mao has advocated for many years, and the principle of opposing purely punitive measures, is there a right-leaning situation in the implementation? Is it possible that due to excessive emphasis on treating illnesses to save people, there is no reward or punishment, no right or wrong, only appeasement and no strict discipline in certain specific situations?" He believes that "one of the key issues in improving the relationship between the Party and the masses today is probably a serious implementation of discipline." He said that his "confidence in the Party's complete victory in the rectification is not strong enough." He hoped that the Party's rectification could "eliminate those problems that can cause tears and sighs." According to people's revelations, Chen Renbing, in addition to this speech, also spread similar arguments on other occasions and carried out some activities.

### 陈仁炳主张“算旧账”

　　陈仁炳主张“算旧账”
    本报上海电　民盟上海市委的一些成员，最近在几次座谈会上，对民盟上海市委副主任委员陈仁炳的错误言论，展开了尖锐的批评，认为他最近所散布的所谓“要算旧账”之类的论点，与最近民盟中央某些人的一些反社会主义论调，是一脉相连的。
    陈仁炳的错误言论，主要表现在他在上海市委宣传会议的书面发言中。这个发言的主要内容约有下列各点：他主张要让每一个基层都“鸣”起来，“目前的大问题仍旧是如何鼓励各方面基层的群众打破一切顾虑，在每一个角落里特别是不少的死角里鸣起来放起来。”他说，他感觉“这几天所听到的鸣和放恐怕还只是上海各个角落应该鸣应该放的千分之一、万分之一。”他说，他听到会上揭发出来的一些矛盾后，“感觉到非常沉重、难过。汉朝有个人叫贾谊。贾谊曾经向当时的皇帝上了一篇文章，叫做治安策，拿今天的语言来说，他里面谈的都是当时社会政治内部的矛盾问题。贾谊把他的材料排了个队，那几桩是令人痛哭的，那几桩是令人流涕的，那几桩是令人长太息的，又有那几桩是叫人感觉很不合理的”，他说他将听到的情况也排了一下队，结论是“我不敢一定说有叫人痛哭流涕的事情，但至少，令我们长太息的事情恐怕是实在太多了。”因此他建议“在整风中是应该着重鼓励人发掘缺点和错误的，决不要拿‘抹煞过去成绩’的帽子往人家头上戴”，他还建议在这次整风中要“把群众认为有显著错误的问题的人物，挑几个出来，进行有效的公道的教育和处理，这对于鼓舞放，会比几篇解放日报社论还更有说服力量和动员力量的。”他又说：“我以为在检查缺点、明辨是非、纠正错误的过程中，旧账不是不可以算的。有的犯了错误的同志，最喜欢用反对算旧账来遮掩他自己的错误。”他说：“毛主席多年倡导的治病救人的道理，反对单纯惩办主义的原则，是不是在执行中有偏右的情况？是不是可能由于过分强调治病救人而弄到在某些具体情况中无赏罚，无是非，只有姑息而无严格纪律？”他认为“今天搞好党群关系的关键问题之一恐怕是一个认真执行纪律的问题。”他说，他“对于党整风一定能得全胜的信心，还是不够坚强的”，他希望党这次整风能“消灭那些可以痛哭流涕和长太息的毛病。”根据人们的揭发，陈仁炳除了这个发言外，还在其他场合散播了一些类似论调，并进行了一些活动。
