    Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill Workers' Symposium
    No Allowing Anti-Socialist Statements to Raise Their Heads

    This newspaper reports that the workers of the Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill held a symposium yesterday afternoon, criticizing various absurd arguments that violate socialist interests and denouncing the shameless acts of writing anonymous letters to intimidate others. They unanimously expressed that the working class should unite closely to defend the achievements of socialist construction.

    Xiang Suyun, Deputy Director of the Fine Spinning Workshop, said: "In recent days, after reading the speeches published in the newspapers, I feel that some people are taking advantage of the rectification movement to vigorously promote reactionary remarks. Indeed, some people want to create a 'Party-dominated world' of a single color, and that is the Kuomintang. However, such a 'Party-dominated world' will not last long. Their profession is to oppress the people, so the people overthrew them." She said, "What makes me most angry is that some people are writing anonymous threatening letters during the rectification movement, threatening Mr. Lu Yuwen, preventing him from speaking out in defense of socialism, calling him an 'accomplice of the tiger,' and saying they will not spare him. My father, Xiang Ying, sacrificed himself for socialism. Their blood was not shed in vain, and their efforts have already blossomed and borne fruit. The people will defend the fruits of victory. For the sake of socialism, our older generation was not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice. How can our younger generation today be intimidated by a threatening letter? We can distinguish who are friends and who are enemies, and we will never allow any anti-socialist fallacies to raise their heads."

    Zhang Jidi, an advanced producer from the Weaving Workshop, said: "These days, some people have been publishing reactionary remarks in the newspapers. Like Ge Peiqi, he even said in the newspaper that the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill the Communists. It seems that these people are not on the same path as us workers. He wants to abandon socialism and engage in capitalism. We workers, however, want to wholeheartedly build socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party. Please ask these people to come to the eastern suburbs to see: this place was a wasteland before liberation, and now so many factories have been built. Are these not the achievements of building socialism? Are these not all for the purpose of enabling the broad masses of people to live a good life? Take our factory as an example, since it started production in September 1955, it has overfulfilled the production target every month. We work hard day and night in order to build socialism well as soon as possible. But people like Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping are actually stealing the name of the people to oppose the Communist Party's leadership in building socialism. Everyone, think about it, how can we workers agree?"

    Qiao Xingming, an electrician from the Power Department's Electrical Maintenance Group, said: "We workers should hold more of these symposiums to express our opinions on various reactionary remarks. Ge Peiqi and others believe that the anti-revolution campaign was not good. Everyone knows that the anti-revolution campaign was a class struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. What's wrong with that? Some people who were investigated are not counter-revolutionaries, but through this movement, they clarified their historical problems. Isn't that very beneficial? Take Shi Jianfeng, the leader of our Power Department's Electrical Maintenance Group, for example. In the past, he had some historical problems and did not work boldly. After the anti-revolution campaign, the problems were clarified and he unloaded his burden. Later, with the help of the Party and the Communist Youth League, his enthusiasm was brought into play. In the fourth quarter of last year, his group even received the honorary title of 'Youth Saving Shock Team.' Judging from our situation, I really don't understand why they are so opposed to the anti-revolution campaign."

    Engineer Cheng Jianxun said: "I fully support the Communist Party's rectification movement, which is beneficial to mobilizing all positive factors to build socialism. We should offer our opinions to the Party with a caring attitude, sincerely and realistically. However, I cannot see such an attitude in the speeches of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others. I doubt whether they are speaking from the standpoint of the people. Ge Peiqi said that the masses want to kill the Communists. I want to ask him, who are the masses you are talking about? Who are those who want to kill the Communists? I think there is only a small group of people who dream of capitalist restoration. Chu Anping said that now it is a 'Party-dominated world' of a single color. His words are intended to pit the Communist Party, the vanguard of the working class, against the working class, and to provoke the relationship between the Communist Party and the masses of people. I firmly advocate a 'Party-dominated world' of a single color led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. I support a 'Party-dominated world' that is democratic towards the people and dictatorial towards the enemy."

    Zeng Zudong, Director of the Carding and Roving Workshop, said: "Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income, and that there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. What kind of talk is that! On one side, there is unearned income, dragging socialism back. On the other side, there is day and night labor, building socialism. Isn't this precisely the essential difference? I think these people should not just sit in their rooms and spout fallacies, but come to our factory to see what the workers are doing!"

    Zhang Shaozhou, a boiler water quality testing worker, said: "I hate Ge Peiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist nonsense. Ge Peiqi believes that the 'anti-revolution campaign was a mess, and the Party made a mistake.' I want to ask, from whose standpoint is he looking at the 'anti-revolution' campaign? Does Mr. Ge want us to tolerate counter-revolutionaries doing evil and undermining socialist construction?"

    Zhang Meilan, a worker from the Fine Spinning Workshop and a national model worker, said: "We workers are very concerned about and support the Communist Party's rectification movement. Recently, many people have put forward many valuable opinions to the Party in the rectification movement, but some people are also telling lies with their eyes closed. For example, Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping put forward the argument of abolishing the Communist Party's leadership, which makes us very angry! My own family used to be poor. My father, mother, older brother, and older sister had no education. Later, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, my father was severely injured and killed by the Japanese devils" (her eyes were filled with tears). "Our family farmed the land. The landlord's children beat us and scolded us until after liberation, I was admitted to the factory. Now, we workers can support our families with our own wages. We have a workers' congress in our factory, and there are also production meetings in the workshops. Everything is done by the workers as masters of their own affairs. This is the life of us workers under the leadership of the Communist Party. Please open your eyes and look at these facts!"

    Qin Shuying, an old worker from the Fine Spinning Workshop, said, "After reading the speeches of Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, and others, I feel very angry. Ge Peiqi said that the only people whose lives have improved are the Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes and now ride in small cars. I really don't know what he is thinking. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I worked in a yarn factory. At that time, the capitalists and foremen would punch and kick me if they saw that I was spinning well. They would also draw a painted face on my face with ink and force me to go to the workshop with a painted face. At that time, whenever I heard the whistle to go to work, my mother would always cry as she sent me into the factory gate. After liberation, I completely turned over and became a deputy foreman. What I eat, wear, and live in are very different from before. Unless someone is deliberately lying, who can say that the lives of the masses have not improved? If it were not for the leadership of the Party, how could I have what I have today?"

### 北京国棉二厂职工座谈  不许反社会主义的言论抬头

    北京国棉二厂职工座谈
    不许反社会主义的言论抬头
    本报讯　国营北京第二棉纺织厂职工在昨天下午举行座谈会，批判各种违反社会主义利益的荒谬论调，痛斥写匿名信恐吓别人的无耻行径。一致表示工人阶级紧密团结起来，保卫社会主义建设成果。
    细纱车间副主任项苏云说：这些天以来，我看了报上登的发言，感觉有人利用整风的机会大肆宣传反动言论。的确有人想搞清一色的党天下，那就是国民党。可是，那样的党天下是坐不长的，他们的职业是压迫人民，所以人民把它推翻了。她说，最使我气愤的是有人在整风当中，写匿名恐吓信，威胁卢郁文先生，不让他讲维护社会主义的意见，说他“为虎作伥”，要不饶他。我父亲项英就是为了社会主义而牺牲的，他们的血没有白流，他们的努力已经开花结果，人民是会保卫胜利果实的。为了社会主义，我们的前一辈流血牺牲都不怕，今天我们年青的一代怎么会被一封恐吓信吓住呢？我们能够分清谁是朋友，谁是敌人，我们绝不允许一切反社会主义的谬论抬头。
    织布车间先进生产者章吉娣说：这些日子，有些人一直在报上发表反动言论。像葛佩琦，竟在报纸上说什么群众要推翻共产党，要杀共产党人。看起来，这种人和我们工人不是走的一条路。他是想离开社会主义，搞资本主义。我们工人却是要全心全意地在共产党领导下建设社会主义。请这些人到东郊来看看：这里解放前是一片荒地，现在盖起这么多的工厂，这不都是建设社会主义的成绩？这不都是为了使广大群众过好日子？就拿我们这个工厂来说，从1955年9月开工生产以来，月月超额完成生产任务。我们不分昼夜地艰苦劳动，就是为了早日把社会主义建设好。可是像葛佩琦、储安平这些人，他们实际上是盗用人民的名义，反对共产党领导我们建设社会主义。大家想想，我们工人怎能答应呢？
    动力部电器保全组电工乔星明说：我们工人要多开这样的座谈会，表达我们对各种反动言论的意见。葛佩琦等人认为肃反不好，谁都知道肃反是一场阶级斗争，是肃清反革命分子，这有什么不好呢？有些被审查的人不是反革命分子，可是，经过这个运动，弄清了自己的历史问题，这不是很有好处吗？就拿我们动力部电器保全组组长史剑峰来说，过去他有些历史问题，工作不大胆，经过肃反，问题弄清楚了，卸下了包袱。以后经过党、团的帮助，他的积极性发挥出来；在去年第四季度，他的小组还得到青年节约突击小组的光荣称号。从我们这里的情况看来，真不明白他们为什么要这样反对肃反。
    工程师程建勋说：我完全拥护共产党整风，这对发动一切积极因素建设社会主义有好处。我们应该抱着爱护的态度，诚恳地实事求是地对党提意见。可是，我从葛佩琦、储安平等人的发言中，看不到这样的态度。我怀疑他们是不是站在人民立场讲话的。葛佩琦说群众要杀共产党。我要质问他，你说的群众是谁？那些人想杀共产党？我看只有一小撮梦想资本主义复辟的人。储安平说现在是清一色的党天下。他的话是想把工人阶级的先锋队共产党和工人阶级对立起来，挑拨共产党和人民群众的关系。我坚决主张以工人阶级为首、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的清一色，我拥护对人民民主、对敌人专政的清一色。
    梳并粗车间主任曾祖东说：章乃器说定息不是剥削，是不劳而获的收入，又说资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子没有本质的区别，这是什么话！一边是不劳而获，拖社会主义后腿，一边是日夜劳动，建设社会主义，这不正是本质的区别吗？我看，这些人不要只是坐在屋子里发谬论，还是到我们工厂里看看工人们在干什么吧！
    锅炉水质试验工人张少洲说：我恨透了葛佩琦反党反社会主义的胡说八道。葛佩琦认为“肃反运动搞糟了，党犯了错误”，我要问问，他是站在什么人的立场上来看“肃反”运动呢？难道容忍反革命为非做歹，破坏社会主义建设，才是葛先生的心愿吗？
    细纱车间工人、全国劳动模范张梅兰说：我们工人对共产党进行整风是非常关心、非常拥护的。最近很多人在整风中对党提出了许多宝贵的意见，但也有一些人闭着眼睛说瞎话。如葛佩琦、储安平就提出了取消共产党领导的论点，这使我们非常气愤！我自己过去一家受穷，父亲、母亲、哥哥、姐姐都没有学过文化。后来在抗日战争时，我父亲就被日本鬼子打得重伤死去了（她眼睛里含着泪水）。我们一家种地，地主的孩子打我们、骂我们，直到解放以后我才考上了工厂。现在我们工人都能够靠自己的工资养活自己的家庭了。我们工厂里有职工代表大会，车间里还有生产会议，一切都叫工人当家作主，这就是在共产党领导下我们工人的生活。请这些先生们睁开眼睛来看看这些事实吧！
    细纱车间老工人秦淑英说，看了储安平、葛佩琦等人的发言，真使人气不打一处来。葛佩琦说现在生活提高的只有过去穿破鞋、今天坐小卧车的党员和干部。真不知道他说这话是安的什么心眼儿。在国民党反动统治时期，我就在纱厂做工。那时候，资本家、领班的看我纺出了花，就是一顿拳打脚踢，还用墨水在脸上画成花脸，强迫我带着花脸去看车。那时候，每当听到上班汽笛响，我妈总是哭着送我进工厂大门。解放以后，我彻底翻了身，当了副工长，吃的、穿的、住的都和以前大不一样。只要不是故意扯谎，谁能说群众的生活没有改善呢？如果没有党的领导，我怎么能有今天呢？
