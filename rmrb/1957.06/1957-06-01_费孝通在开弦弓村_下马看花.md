Fei Xiaotong "Dismounts to View the Flowers" in Kaixiangong Village

He said: The total agricultural output of this village has increased by 60% compared with twenty years ago, but the output value of sideline occupations is 40% lower. To increase farmers' income, it is not enough to rely solely on agricultural production increases.

(Report from this newspaper) Fei Xiaotong, a representative of the National People's Congress and Vice President of the Nationalities Institute, recently conducted a twenty-day survey in Kaixianggong Village, Kaixiang Township, Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, the same place where he conducted a rural survey twenty years ago. He has now submitted his opinions on rural construction to the leaders of the Suzhou Prefecture, which has been taken seriously by the leading authorities in this region.

Fei Xiaotong pointed out that the total agricultural (grain) output of this village in 1956 increased by 60% compared with 1936, twenty years ago. This increase was particularly significant after agricultural cooperation; however, the output value of sideline occupations has not yet returned to the level of twenty years ago, and is currently 40% lower than twenty years ago. Therefore, despite the rapid increase in agriculture, the net income of farmers in 1956 only increased by about 5% compared to 1936. Fei Xiaotong said, "It is possible to continue to increase rice yield from the current 500-plus jin per mu to about 700 jin, the key is to solve the fertilizer shortage. However, here there are many people and little land, to increase farmers' income, it is not enough to rely solely on agricultural production increases."

Fei Xiaotong talked about several prominent problems existing in the village's sideline production. The first is that silkworm cocoon production is only 60% of what it was twenty years ago. The fundamental reason is the reduction of mulberry field area, which has led to a decline in mulberry leaf production. He said, "If replanting and reclamation are carried out, it is possible to double the area in three to five years, but no action has been taken here this year." He expressed great regret. The second is that he suggested that relevant departments should line up and move many agricultural product processing enterprises to the countryside. This would not affect the lives of workers and could increase the income of farmers. The third is that this village is a water town, with more than 160 boats. In the past, farmers engaged in transportation as a sideline during slack seasons, but now only ten boats are doing this, resulting in a great waste of boat power. According to the survey, each boat used to earn the equivalent of 750 jin of rice per year in addition to accumulating fertilizer. Is it possible to study how these boats can play a role in transportation? The fourth is that the feed problem for sideline animal husbandry has not been completely solved, hindering the development of sideline occupations such as sheep, rabbits, and pigs; therefore, it is not possible to accumulate sufficient fertilizer, and agricultural output will be difficult to increase. He suggested that the leadership pay attention to studying the use of water surfaces for planting feed. According to the local situation, the water surface area is larger than the land area.

Fei Xiaotong further raised a social problem currently existing in rural areas: farmers do not pay attention to accumulation. He said, "After I arrived in the countryside, many old ladies complained to me that they did not have enough money to spend and not enough grain to eat. I did not believe it, and later they told me the truth during the investigation." He said: The income of farmers here is outstanding and high nationwide. Last year, the collective income distribution averaged 82 yuan per person according to population, plus family sideline income, each person earned more than 100 yuan. However, the living expenses of farmers here are also prominently high nationwide. After cooperation, farmers spent the first year building houses, the second year making clothes, and now they are particular about eating. In a word, they do not pay attention to accumulation and use money without a plan. He believes that the government should pay attention to this issue and strengthen education, otherwise, no matter how much production increases, farmers will not become prosperous. He believes that in these twenty years, farmers have experienced several incidents, and the accumulations before the Anti-Japanese War have been emptied, so the family foundation is weak; after liberation, they have achieved stability, but they are still not prosperous and should be made prosperous.

Fei Xiaotong's book based on his survey in this village twenty years ago was published in New Zealand and later translated into eleven languages, becoming an important reference material for foreigners to understand the old Chinese countryside. Accompanying Fei Xiaotong to Kaixianggong Village this time were three comrades from the China Economic Research Institute, who will continue to conduct investigations there for more than a month. Fei Xiaotong said: Once the investigation is over, he will write another book to introduce the new face of the new Chinese countryside to foreigners. He said that this time he came in response to Chairman Mao's call for intellectuals to dismount and view the flowers, and he said that he would come to this place again in the future.

### 费孝通在开弦弓村“下马看花”

    费孝通在开弦弓村“下马看花”
    他说：这个村的农业总产量比二十年前增加了60％，但副业产值低40％。要增加农民收入，光靠农业增产是不行的。
    本报讯　全国人民代表大会代表、民族学院副院长费孝通，最近在二十年前作过农村调查的旧地——江苏吴江县开弦乡开弦弓村进行了二十天的调查以后，日前已向苏州专署的负责人提出了有关农村建设的意见，受到这个地区领导机关的重视。
    费孝通指出，这个村的农业（粮食）总产量，1956年比二十年前的1936年增加了60％，这种增加，在农业合作化以后，表现得特别显著；但是副业产值还没有恢复到二十年前的水平，目前比二十年前还要低40％。因此，尽管农业上升较快，农民的纯收入1956年只比1936年增加5％左右。费孝通说：“水稻产量从现在的每亩五百多斤继续提高到七百斤左右是可能的，关键是要解决缺肥问题。但是这里人多地少，要增加农民收入，光靠农业增产是不行的”。
    费孝通谈到了这个村副业生产存在的几个突出问题。第一是蚕茧产量只及二十年前的60％，根本原因是桑田面积缩小，因此桑叶产量下降。他说：“如果进行补种、垦种，在三、五年内把面积扩大一倍是可能的，但是今年这里没有动手。”他表示很惋惜。第二是他建议有关部门排排队，将许多农产品加工企业放到农村里去。这样，既不影响工人的生活，又可以增加农民的收入。第三是这个村是一个水乡，现有一百六十多条船，从前农闲时都从事运输副业，现在只有十条船在做，船力浪费很大。根据调查，从前每条船在积肥以外每年还能赚回相当于七百五十斤大米的收入。是否可以研究一下，这些船力怎样在运输方面发挥作用？第四是饲养副业的饲料问题还没有彻底解决，阻碍着羊、兔、猪等副业的发展；因此，就不能充分积肥，农业产量也就难以提高。他建议领导上能够注意研究利用水面来种植饲料，据当地的情况，水面面积比陆地面积还要大。
    费孝通进一步提出了当前农村中的一个社会问题：农民不注意积累。他说：“我到农村以后，不少老太太向我叫苦，说钱不够用，粮不够吃，我不信，以后调查中她们向我讲了良心话。”他说：这里农民的收入在全国来说是突出的，是高的。去年集体收入的分配，按人口每人平均分到八十二元，加上家庭副业收入，每人在一百元以上。可是这里的农民生活费用之高，在全国也是突出的。合作化以后，农民第一年是造房子，第二年是做衣服，现在是讲究吃了。一句话，不注意积累，用钱没计划。他认为政府应该重视这个问题，要加强教育，否则增产再多些，农民也是不会殷实起来的。他认为在这个二十年中，农民经过几次事变，抗日战争以前有些积累，已经掏空了，因此家底子薄；解放以后得到了稳定，但是还不殷实，应该让农民殷实起来。
    费孝通二十年前在这个村里调查以后的著作，曾在新西兰出版，以后被翻译成十一国文字，成为外人了解旧中国农村的重要参考材料。这次随同费孝通来到开弦弓村的还有中国经济研究所的三个同志，他们将继续在那里调查一个多月。费孝通表示：一俟调查结束，他将再写一本书，向外人介绍新中国农村的新面貌。他说，这一次是响应毛主席提出的知识分子下马看花的号召而来的，他表示今后还要到这个地方来。
