　　Tearing Off Zhang Bojun's Mask
　　—Li Boqiu and Others Initially Expose Zhang Bojun's Various Anti-Communist Activities and Utterances

　　This Newspaper reports: At the expanded meeting of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party yesterday, many people, based on what they knew, initially exposed Zhang Bojun's anti-Communist double-dealing words and actions.

　　Li Boqiu said: What exactly is Zhang Bojun's "heart's desire"? After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Zhang Bojun said at a discussion meeting of the Central Committee of the Peasants' and Workers' Party and comrades from other places in Beijing: "You see, the Soviet Union must change, and China cannot let many little Stalins rule." In another conversation, when talking about grading and salary assessment, he expressed great dissatisfaction, saying: "In the state organs, every level, such as bureau chiefs, division chiefs, and section chiefs, is dominated by Communist Party members, and intellectuals are 'serf labor'. How can people be asked to give play to their initiative?" This is no different from what Chu Anping and others said.

    After the principles of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting one hundred flowers bloom and one hundred schools of thought contend" were put forward, he often said: "The democratic parties have something to do," and "The democratic parties have a heavy responsibility." But his so-called "something to do" and "heavy responsibility" did not refer to the increased responsibility of the democratic parties for uniting and educating intellectuals, but had other ulterior motives. He separated socialism from democracy, believing that "the modern world socialist movement and the democratic movement will converge." "China must catch up with the United States in the two issues of science and democracy." He is always thinking about the Third Road—anti-Marxist reformism.

　　Zhang Bojun often made "remarks" at the National Work Conference, the Central Cadre Meeting of the Peasants' and Workers' Party, and at meetings of party members and the masses in Beijing, exaggerating the atomic power of the United States and emphasizing that the atomic bomb could destroy the world in a few minutes in the atomic age. He believed that the statement about the economic crisis of capitalism was "superficial and boring." He said: "The production of Japan and West Germany has increased several times. The production of the United States has also increased. Capitalism still has vitality."

　　Regarding the appointment of cadres, Zhang Bojun said on the surface that there should be a system, but in reality, he only wanted to use the people in his own pocket. He said to the cadres: "The Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has two sets of cadres, one from the United Front Work Department and one from me." When the Sixth Central Committee Third Plenary Session of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was held, he said, "Ji Fang, Li Boqiu and I had a falling out. At that time, Li Shihao, Guo Qiaoran, Zeng Wei, and Shen Baowen all opposed me." After the Third Plenary Session, Zhang Bojun specifically talked to me: "You can manage less about the central affairs, I will manage it myself."

　　During the tense stage of the War of Liberation, when Chiang Kai-shek announced that the democratic parties were illegal organizations and forced the dissolution of the China Democratic League, he hid and planned to escape to Hong Kong. Before leaving, he left a letter to be forwarded to Mr. Zhang Lan. The letter said: "At the same time as the dissolution of the Democratic League, the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party will also be dissolved." The letter was forwarded by a member of the Central Committee who stayed in Shanghai to Zeng Wei (Zeng Wei was then the Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Peasants' and Workers' Party and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, who died in Shanghai on the eve of liberation). Zeng Wei believed that Zhang had no right to send this letter and, with the consent of Qiu Zhe, burned the letter. After Zhang arrived in Hong Kong, he had to superficially adapt to the situation of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League continuing to adhere to the democratic struggle. However, at the Third Plenary Session of the Democratic League, he was not satisfied with his personal position and power, and he angrily denounced. Later, in Hong Kong, he engaged in his own activities. He publicly stated that China should implement a "federal system." At the same time, he attempted to contact various parties to engage in military activities, and incited cadres, advocating that the Peasants' and Workers' Party could develop 100,000 or 80,000 party members in a few months. At the same time, when Comrade Zeng Wei's lover was about to secretly go from Hong Kong to Shanghai, Zhang instructed her in my presence to tell Zeng Wei not to recruit Communist Party members (in fact, the underground organizations of the Peasants' and Workers' Party in Guangdong and Shanghai had overlapping relationships with underground Communist Party members). At that time, many comrades opposed his views and practices, and everyone elected some comrades to summarize and present criticisms of him at the meeting, and he angrily denounced. At the same time, the democratic front in Hong Kong also launched a critique of his rightist activities, which made him very angry. In order to ease the situation, Comrade Wang Shenlin and I went to see him. I said, all activities can be frank with the CCP, and there is no need to be secret. He said: "I have one thousand US dollars in my pocket, and I want to go to Switzerland. You can take care of the affairs of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party." In fact, at that time, he was very enthusiastic about his own set of organizations and military activities, such as arranging for Zhang Juechu to be responsible for the "directly affiliated central group." Comrades of the Peasants' and Workers' Party and the Democratic League discovered that Zhang Juechu used the name of the directly affiliated central group of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to issue documents insulting the labor conference held in liberated Harbin. When the Central Committee of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party gave Zhang Juechu a suspension, Zhang said it was "agreed by Zhang Bojun before leaving Hong Kong." (This person has been expelled and is still engaged in reactionary activities in Hong Kong, printing a book called "Past Events," which also mentions this matter.)

　　In 1948, before Zhang Bojun went north, just on the eve of the victory of the War of Liberation, our party held an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee and passed a political resolution. However, he still violated this resolution and made military arrangements, attempting to seize a piece of land south of the Yangtze River as political capital. The day before his departure, he asked me to talk at the Peninsula Hotel for a long time. He said, "I have already negotiated with various friendly parties to form hundreds of thousands of troops. The plan is for the Third Party to take charge of Fujian and Jiangxi, a certain friendly party to take charge of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi, and Guangdong as a common base. ..." He also predicted that Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of the United States, might still retain Jiangsu and Zhejiang. He believed that in this way, he could organize a coalition government with the CCP. This trip north was to negotiate with a representative of a certain friendly party and the CCP. His military speculation of dividing the world into three parts caused many comrades in our party to still have the mistake of not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves after liberation. On the way north, when he heard the broadcast of the liberation of Jinan on the ship, he knew that the purpose of this trip could not be achieved (as he himself recounted). After arriving in Harbin, he wrote a letter to the members of the Central Committee who remained in Hong Kong, saying, in essence: "After arriving in Harbin, I deeply regret this trip. There is nothing to do here. I miss Hong Kong very much and still want to find a way to return to Hong Kong." In March 1949, when I came to Beijing, he said to me again, "My proposition was not wrong. The only difference is that I didn't go to the mountains. If I had gone to the mountains, then we would have had a commander-in-chief."

　　Luo Renyi said: Zhang Bojun's double-dealing approach has been like this since the beginning of the War of Resistance. In Chongqing, I lived with him and saw with my own eyes that he accepted the leadership of the Communist Party on the one hand, and secretly engaged in anti-communism on the other, and often had contact with right-wing elements. What exactly is he hiding, everyone should search for it.

　　Zhang Yunchuan said: Before liberation, when the Democratic League was forced to dissolve, I and Zhang Bojun took a rickshaw to Zhang Lan's house in Shanghai. On the way, I said to him: Looking at the news in today's newspaper, the People's Liberation Army suffered a loss in a battle in Shandong. What did Zhang Bojun say? He said: It is good to suffer a little loss, so that the peace talks can be faster. From his conversation at that time, it can be seen that he hoped that the peace talks would be successful so that he could become an official in Nanjing.

　　After the Japanese surrender, he used his party affiliation to obtain a house in Shanghai. Later, when he saw the temporary victory of the Kuomintang, he lost confidence in the revolution and ran to Hong Kong as a rentier. He sublet the house in Shanghai for eighteen or nineteen gold bars; besides paying off some debts, he used five taels to hire a lawyer. At that time, there were more than two hundred people working underground in Shanghai, and he only left five taels for them. Some comrades were so angry that they cried. Later, I also arrived in Hong Kong and heard that he entrusted a manager of the Yunnan Bank to exchange thirteen gold bars from Shanghai to Hong Kong. However, Wang Xinrong lived in a small room and had no food to eat, and he ignored it.

　　Wang Jiyi said: Zhang Bojun once said: "The United States has political democracy but no economic democracy; the Soviet Union has no political democracy but has economic democracy." Does this not oppose the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat?

　　He Shikun said: Zhang Bojun once called on everyone at the Third Plenary Session of our party to adopt a "yielding overcomes firmness" method for the relationship between the leadership and the led with the Communist Party. He said: "Compared with the tongue and teeth, the teeth always fall first."

　　Although he called on us to carry out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at the CPPCC and the party's working meetings, he angrily denounced at another meeting when some comrades mentioned that the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party must suppress counter-revolutionaries: "Let you suppress counter-revolutionaries! Organize a counter-revolutionary suppression committee, with so-and-so as the director, so-and-so as the deputy director, and so-and-so, a Communist Party member, as a member." What is the purpose of this contradiction?

　　After a working meeting of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, when he invited local cadres to dinner separately, Zhang said, "In the future, I can appoint you as officials." This sentence is worthy of pondering.

### 撕破章伯钧的假面具—李伯球等初步揭发章伯钧反共活动的种种言行

　　撕破章伯钧的假面具
　　—李伯球等初步揭发章伯钧反共活动的种种言行
    本报讯　昨天在中国农工民主党中央执行局扩大会议上，许多人根据自己所知道的情况，初步揭发了章伯钧反共的两面派言行。
    李伯球说：章伯钧“心中的事”究竟是什么？在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，章伯钧在农工党中央和外地来京同志的谈话会上说：“你们看，苏联一定要变，中国也不能让许多小斯大林统治下去。”在另一次的谈话会上，谈到评级评薪时，他表示很不满意，他说：“国家机关里的每一级，如局长、司长、科长，都是共产党员作主，知识分子是“‘农奴劳动’，怎样叫人去发挥积极性呢？”这与储安平等所说的话，没有丝毫不同。
    “长期共存、互相监督”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，他常常说：“民主党派有搞头了”，“民主党派责任很重。”但他的所谓“有搞头”、“责任重”，并不是指民主党派对知识分子团结教育责任的增大而言，而是别有用心。他把社会主义与民主割裂开来看。认为“现代世界社会主义运动与民主运动将要汇合”。“中国要在科学与民主两个问题上赶上美国”。他念念不忘第三条路线——反马克思主义的改良主义。
    章伯钧在农工党全国工作会议、中央干部会和在北京市党员和群众集会上，常常大发“议论”，夸大美国的原子力量，强调原子弹时代几分钟就可以毁灭世界。他认为关于资本主义经济危机的说法是“浅薄无聊”。他说：“日本和西德的生产提高几倍。美国生产也还有提高。资本主义还有活力的。”
    章伯钧对干部的任用，表面说要有制度，实际上只想用他自己夹袋里的人，他对干部说过：“农工民主党有两套干部，一套是统战部的，一套是我的。”在农工民主党六届三中全会开会时，他说“季方、李伯球和我闹翻过的。“当时李士豪、郭翘然、曾伟、申葆文都是一致反对我的。”在三中全会后章伯钧特找我谈：“中央的事你可以少管，我自己来管了。”
    解放战争紧张阶段，当蒋介石宣布民主党派为非法组织，强迫解散民盟的时候，他躲起来，打算逃到香港去。临行前留下一封信要转交给张澜先生。信里说：“民盟解散的同时，农工民主党也解散。”经留在上海的一位中委转到曾伟手里（曾伟是当时农工党组织部副部长、上海市主任委员，解放前夕在上海牺牲），曾伟认为章无权发这一封信，征得丘哲同意之后，把信烧掉了。章到香港后，表面不能不适应民盟南方总支部继续坚持民主斗争的情势。但是在民盟三中全会上，没有满足他个人的权位，曾拍案大骂。以后在香港则搞他自己的一套活动。曾公开发表中国要实行“联邦制”的主张。同时企图联络各方搞军事活动，向干部鼓吹农工党可以在几个月发展十万八万党员。同时当曾伟同志的爱人要由香港秘密往上海时，章当我的面嘱咐她转告曾伟，不要吸收共产党员（事实上广东和上海的农工党地下组织同中共地下党员有交叉关系）。那时候很多同志都反对他的主张和做法，大家推定一些同志综合整理提到会议上对他批评，他即拍案大骂。与此同时，香港的民主阵线也展开了对他的右派活动的批判，他大为气愤。为了缓和情况，我曾和王深林同志去见他，我说，一切活动对中共可以坦然，不必有秘密。他说：“我腰包里有一千元美金，要到瑞士去，农工民主党的事你们去搞吧。”实际上他那个时候对自己的一套组织和军事活动很热心。如布置张觉初负责“直属中心小组”。农工党和民盟同志发现张觉初用农工民主党直属中心小组名义发出的侮蔑在解放了的哈尔滨举行的劳动大会的文件。农工民主党中央给张觉初停职处分时，张说是“章伯钧离港以前同意的”。（此人已被开除了，现仍在香港进行反动活动，印有“往事”一册，其中还谈到此事。）
    1948年在章伯钧北上前，正是解放战争胜利的前夕，我党召开了中央扩大会议，通过了政治决议。但他仍然违反这个决议，作军事上的布置，企图在长江以南抓一把，作为政治资本。临行前一天找我到半岛酒店谈了半天，他说“我已经和各友方商约，编几十万军队。计划闽赣由第三党搞，鄂湘桂由某友方搞，广东为共同的基地，……他并预料蒋介石在美国支持下可能仍保有江浙。他认为，这样就可以和中共组织联合政府了。此次北行就是与某友方代表去和中共谈判。他这种三分天下的军事投机，害得我党不少同志在解放后仍有敌我不分的错误。他在北上途中船上听到济南解放的广播时，知道此行的目的达不到了（他自己追述的）。到了哈尔滨后，他却写信给留港部分中委，大意说：“我到哈后，深悔此行，此间无事可为，我很怀念香港，仍想设法回到香港来。”1949年3月，我来到北京时，他又对我说，“我的主张没有错，所差的只是没有上山，如果上了山的话，那我们也有了总司令。”
    罗任一说：章伯钧的两面派作法，从抗战开始就是如此。在重庆时，我和他住在一起，亲眼看到他一面接受共产党的领导，一面又鬼头祟脑反共，并经常同右派分子有来往。他究竟包藏的有什么阴谋，大家应该搜寻一下。
    张云川说：在解放前，当民盟被迫解散时，在上海我和章伯钧坐三轮车到张澜家里去，路上我向他说：看今天报上消息，解放军在山东有一仗打的吃亏了。章伯钧怎么说？他说：吃点亏也好，这样可以使和谈更快一点。从他当时的谈话中可以看出来，他希望和谈成功，好到南京做官。
    在日本投降后，他以党派关系在上海弄到一所房子。后来，当时他看到国民党的一时胜利，就对革命丧失了信心，跑到香港作寓公。他在上海把房子出顶，顶了十八、九根金条；除还一部分帐，请律师用了五两。当时在上海做地下工作的有两百多人，他只给留了五两。有的同志气得哭。后来我也到了香港，听说他托云南银行的一位经理从上海把十三根金条兑到香港。可是，王欣荣住在亭子间没饭吃，他也不理。
    王寄一说：章伯钧曾说：“美国政治民主，经济不民主；苏联政治不民主，经济民主。”言外之意，不是反对社会主义革命和无产阶级专政是什么？
    何世琨说：章伯钧曾在我党三中全会上号召大家对共产党的领导与被领导的关系要采取“以柔克刚”的办法，他说：“拿舌头与牙齿比，牙齿总是先落。”
    他在政协和本党工作会议上虽都号召要肃反，可是在另一个会议上，对某些同志提到农工民主党必须肃反时，他就拍案大骂起来了：“让你们去肃反！组织肃反委员会，某某人当主任，某人当副主任，某人是共产党员当委员。”这样前后矛盾，其用意何在呢？
    在农工民主党召开的一次工作会议后，他分别请地方干部吃饭时，章说，“今后我可以委你们官了”，这句话是值得玩味的。
