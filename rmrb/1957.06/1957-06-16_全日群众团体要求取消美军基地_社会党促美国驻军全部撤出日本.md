Xinhua News Agency, 15th: A total of 10,000 representatives from 120 mass organizations across Japan held a "National Assembly to Make Demands on the United States" in Tokyo this afternoon. The assembly passed a resolution demanding that the United States abolish the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" and remove its military bases in Japan.

    Workers, farmers, students, women, peace activists, and cultural figures participating in the assembly, in their adopted resolution, also demanded that the United States return the administrative rights of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan; opposed the United States transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and stationing atomic troops in Japan; demanded that the United States reconsider its policy toward China and abolish the "embargo" restrictions against China; and demanded that the United States sign an agreement with Britain and the Soviet Union to ban nuclear weapons testing.
    After the closing of the assembly, representatives were dispatched to submit the assembly's resolution to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and the U.S. Embassy. The masses participating in the assembly also held a demonstration march in the city.

    At the same time, the Tokyo Okinawa Prefectural Association, an organization of the people of Okinawa in Tokyo, sent representatives to the U.S. Embassy today to submit a letter of demand, requesting that U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower immediately return the administrative rights of Okinawa to Japan, not transport nuclear weapons into Japan, and stop implementing the so-called policy of paying land requisition rents in a lump sum, which attempts to permanently occupy the land of Okinawa residents.
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Tokyo News: The Japan Socialist Party today passed a resolution demanding that Nobusuke Kishi urge the United States to withdraw all American troops from Japan.
    In its resolution passed today, the Socialist Party also demanded that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who will depart for the United States tomorrow, guarantee that the United States will not transport nuclear weapons into Japan or station atomic troops in Japan. The Socialist Party once again put forward the following demands: Japan must take back the administrative rights of Okinawa from the United States; urge the United States to relax the "embargo" against China, and demand an immediate end to nuclear weapons testing. The Socialist Party in its resolution also put forward the demand that the military treaties between the United States and Japan and between China and the Soviet Union be abolished and replaced by a non-aggression treaty among China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Japan.
    The Socialist Party today dispatched representatives to hand over its resolution to officials of the U.S. Embassy.
