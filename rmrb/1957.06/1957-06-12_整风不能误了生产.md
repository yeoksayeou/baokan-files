　　Rectification Should Not Delay Production

　　Currently, it is a very important season for agricultural work. Many Party organizations in various regions are beginning rectification campaigns. How to ensure that the rectification movement is closely integrated with the effort to achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production is a major problem that must be properly resolved at present.

　　The spring sowing of major autumn crops has now ended in various regions. Complex and diverse field management tasks are waiting to be done. In areas with two crops a year, the intensive harvesting of summer crops is beginning, and the sowing of late autumn crops is about to begin. If we do not strengthen leadership over agricultural cooperatives and provide specific assistance and guidance to them in carrying out these agricultural activities and other tasks in a planned and orderly manner, a situation of attending to one thing and losing sight of another will occur. For example, last year, some areas, due to improper arrangements for wheat harvesting, missed the optimal harvesting time, and coupled with continuous rain at the time, some wheat rotted, sprouted, and was left in the fields, resulting in some losses in grain and fodder. Some agricultural cooperatives were so focused on harvesting wheat that they neglected the cotton fields, which affected cotton production. Currently, some regions have already experienced disasters such as wind, hail, floods, and droughts, and in some regions, crop diseases and insect pests have also begun to occur. This urgently requires leading organs in various regions to organize the vast number of farmers to combat natural disasters on the one hand, and to strengthen field management of crops on the other, to ensure better growth and development of crops.

　　However, according to inspections by the Ministry of Agriculture, the sown area of ​​sorghum, millet and other coarse grains has increased this year compared to last year, while the sown area of ​​corn, soybeans, peanuts, and jute has decreased compared to last year. The sown area of cotton is more than three million mu less than planned, and more than five million mu less than the cotton field area last year. If the sown area of these crops does not increase, it will be even more difficult to complete this year's production increase plan. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to take various effective measures and make every effort to increase the yield per unit area. The situation of weak and insufficient draft animals is still serious in many areas, and it is urgent to seize the favorable opportunity to do a good job in fattening and breeding, and strive to complete the livestock breeding plan.

　　Our Party, the government, and the people of the whole country have placed great hope on achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Because a large increase in agricultural production is an important material foundation for correctly resolving contradictions among the people. Only by greatly increasing the production of various agricultural products can we effectively guarantee the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people. Therefore, we must make unremitting and all-out efforts to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Although the spring sowing season has passed, we cannot relax our efforts to increase agricultural production in the slightest. We must earnestly do a good job in summer sowing and field management. If any shortcomings and omissions are found in production now, we must immediately catch up and take various effective measures to remedy them by using the summer production season in the next few months. It is still possible to remedy it. If there is any negligence or slack now, and this summer production season is missed, it will be too late to start remedying it. Therefore, it can be said that we are currently in a critical season for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture, and the task is extremely arduous.

　　Therefore, we must pay close attention to closely integrating rectification with agricultural production work, and not delay the crucial opportunity for agricultural production because of rectification.

　　The agencies that are starting rectification (mainly provincial party committee agencies at present) must make proper arrangements for rectification and leadership of agricultural production in terms of time and division of labor among leaders, and not weaken the specific leadership of agricultural production because of rectification. Agencies that are not currently carrying out rectification should explain clearly to their members and the masses, so that everyone can concentrate on doing a good job in agricultural production. The Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided that during the summer harvest and summer planting period, meetings that should be stopped should be stopped, and meetings that should be postponed should be postponed; county-level agencies will not carry out rectification for the time being, and prefectural committee agencies can suspend rectification studies when production is at its most intense; the provincial party committee requires agriculture, water conservancy, food and other departments to draw some strength during the rectification period to specifically solve problems in the summer harvest and summer planting work, and transfer some cadres to the countryside to promote production. In order not to miss the farming season and do a good job in summer production, such decisions and arrangements are very necessary.

　　In this season of rapid changes in agricultural production, it is particularly necessary to conduct timely and in-depth inspections of the production situation, in order to regularly grasp the progress of agricultural activities, the growth of crops, and the situation of natural disasters, and to promptly discover problems in the work, and help solve them in time. Recently, some provinces have not paid due attention and vigilance to the situation of diseases and insect pests. When locusts have already passed the third or fourth instar, the provincial agricultural leading agencies still do not understand. This situation is dangerous and should be changed immediately. Past experience also tells us that during the progress of the movement, the actual problems in the work below are often shelved or accumulated because the leaders of the relevant departments are busy with the movement, and when the movement comes to an end and they have time to deal with it, production has already suffered more or less damage. In the process of this rectification movement, we must avoid this tendency, resolutely implement the principle of not delaying rectification and work, and all problems involving current production must be solved in time. Only in this way can the slogan of striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture not become empty talk.

### 整风不能误了生产

　　整风不能误了生产
    目前正是非常重要的农事季节。各地许多党组织正在开始整风。怎样保证整风运动同争取大丰收的农业生产工作密切结合，是当前必须妥善解决的一个大问题。
    现在各地大秋作物的春播已经结束。繁杂多样的田间管理工作正在等待人们去做。在一年两熟地区，紧张的夏熟作物的收打正在开始，晚秋作物的播种就要开始。如果不加强对农业社的领导，具体地帮助和指导它们有计划、有秩序地进行这些农事活动和其他工作，就会发生顾此失彼的现象。比如去年有些地区由于麦收工作安排不当，收打失时，加以当时连续阴雨，致使一些小麦霉烂、发芽和遗弃在地里，粮食和饲草都受到一些损失。也有一些农业社光顾着收麦打麦，丢下棉田不管，结果影响了棉花的增产。目前有些地区已经发生了风、雹、水旱等灾害，在有些地区，农作物病虫害也开始发生。这就迫切需要各地领导机关组织广大农民，一方面同自然灾害进行斗争，一方面加强对农作物的田间管理，保证农作物更好的生长发育。
    但是，据农业部检查，今年高粱、谷子等杂粮的播种面积比去年增加，玉米、大豆、花生、黄麻的播种面积都比去年减少。棉花播种面积比计划少了三百多万亩，比去年的棉田面积减少五百多万亩。这些作物播种面积没有增加，要完成今年的增产计划，就更加吃力了。因此必须抓紧时机采取各种有效措施，尽一切努力提高单位面积产量。很多地区耕畜瘦弱和畜力不足的情况仍然严重，亟需抓紧有利时机做好抢膘和配种工作，力争完成牲畜增殖计划。
    我们的党、政府和全国人民对于争取今年的农业大丰收，寄予了极大的希望。因为农业的大量增产是正确地解决人民内部矛盾的重要物质基础。只有大量地增产各种农产品，才能有效地保证城乡人民生活的改善。因此我们必须坚持不懈地、千方百计地努力，争取今年的农业大丰收。虽然现在春播季节已经过去了，但是我们丝毫不能放松对于农业增产的努力。必须认真做好夏季播种和田间管理工作。如果现在发现了生产上有什么缺陷和疏漏，立刻急起直追，利用今后几个月的夏季生产季节，采取各种有效措施加以补救，还是来得及的。如果现在稍有疏忽、松懈，错过了这个夏季生产季节，再想动手补救，可就晚了。因此可以说，目前是正处在争取农业大丰收的关键性季节，任务极其艰巨。
    因此，必须十分注意使整风与农业生产工作密切结合，而不要因为整风贻误了千金一刻的农业生产的紧要时机。
    正在开始整风的机关（目前主要是省委机关），必须对于整风和领导农业生产，在时间上和领导人员分工上作出妥善的安排，不要因为整风而削弱了对于农业生产的具体领导。而目前尚不进行整风的机关，应该向所属成员和广大群众说清楚，让大家集中力量搞好农业生产。中共河南省委最近决定：在夏收夏种期间，会议该停的停，该推迟的推迟；县级机关暂不进行整风，地委机关在生产最紧张的时候可以暂停整风学习；省委要求农业、水利、粮食等部门在整风期间抽出一些力量专门解决夏收夏种工作中的问题，并抽调部分干部下乡推动生产。为了不误农时，搞好夏季生产，这样的决定和安排是很必要的。
    在这个农业生产情况变化很快的季节，特别需要对于生产情况做及时的和深入的检查，以便经常地掌握农事活动的进展情况、作物生长情况、自然灾害的情况，及时发现工作中发生的问题，并且及时帮助下面解决。最近，有的省对于病虫害的情况没有给予应有的注意和警惕，当蝗虫已经过了三、四龄的时候，省的农业领导机关还不了解。这种情况是危险的，应该马上改变。过去的经验还告诉我们，在运动进展期间，下边工作中的实际问题，往往因为有关部门的领导人员忙于运动，而被搁置或积压起来，等到运动告一段落腾出手来的时候，生产已经受到或多或少的损失。在这次整风运动的过程中，我们一定要避免这种偏向，坚决贯彻执行整风和工作两不误的原则，凡是涉及当前生产的问题，都要及时加以解决。只有这样，争取农业大丰收的口号才不致变成空谈。
