Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 17th: Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, in a speech at a forum convened by the United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on June 15th, exposed the activities of rightist elements Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at the national work conference convened by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League in April this year, and the adverse impact of these activities on the China Democratic League's local organizations. The original text of his speech (slightly abridged) is as follows:

Recently, the China Democratic League has launched a struggle against anti-socialist remarks and against revisionism. The revisionist ideas of Comrades Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have been refuted, and it has been proposed that the China Democratic League must turn from right to left. The opinions from all sides have been very enlightening to me. I have carefully considered my own thoughts and work in light of this, and I have found that some revisionist ideas also exist in my own thinking. I feel that I must consciously criticize erroneous understandings and draw clear ideological boundaries.

　　The suggestions for the work of the China Democratic League completely denied the leadership of the Party.

A month ago, I went to Ya'an to understand the work of the China Democratic League. In the report on daily work, I put forward some opinions and suggestions for improving the work of the Ya'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Regarding the work of participating in political consultation, I proposed that the scope of political consultation should be determined first. I believe that the Party and the democratic parties should conduct consultations on all major national policies implemented throughout the city; consultations should be conducted on major personnel arrangements in the city; consultations should be conducted on important meetings in the city, such as the People's Congress and the Municipal Political Consultative Conference; consultations should be conducted on major relationship issues occurring in all aspects; consultations should be conducted on important suggestions put forward by all parties; and consultations should be conducted on jointly organized activities such as inspections. Secondly, the form of political consultation should be determined. I believe that the CPPCC should be the main form of political consultation. In addition, party joint meetings, municipal people's committee meetings, and various informal exchanges of views are all forms of consultation; the heads of various parties should strengthen contact, and the Party committee can convene heads of democratic parties to exchange views, and democratic parties can also invite responsible comrades of the Party committee to exchange views. Furthermore, the method of political consultation should be improved. I advocated that different methods should be adopted for consultation work according to the nature of the problem. For some problems, the main contents of the consultation should be notified in advance; for some problems, necessary reference materials must be provided; for some problems, the democratic parties should be asked to discuss first, or organize investigation and research work, and extensively collect the opinions of the masses. Regarding the consultation plan, I believe that it can be put forward by the Party committee, by the government, or by the democratic parties. Regarding the method of consultation, I advocated that a preliminary plan could be put forward by one party; or plans could be put forward by all parties; or all parties could express their opinions on the issues raised and jointly formulate a plan. The personnel participating in the consultation are mainly the heads of various parties and aspects; the scope can also be expanded according to the nature of the problem to absorb more personnel to participate in the consultation; some problems can also be assisted by personnel sent by the superiors of all parties. In addition, we also put forward many opinions on participating in cultural and educational affairs management, on the education and management of members, on promoting grass-roots work, and on extensively contacting the masses.

Recently, when I examined my work during that period, I found that none of the work opinions I put forward mentioned the leadership of the Party. I also examined that there were two fundamental erroneous ideas guiding me in the opinions I put forward: First, I prominently emphasized the parallel status of the Party and the democratic parties; second, I emphasized that the democratic parties should participate in the country's decision-making work. From the essence of these ideas, although they did not deny the leadership of the Party head-on, they canceled the Party's leading position in specific work. I once compared the spirit of Zhang Bojun's so-called "political design institute" with my own views on the work of the China Democratic League, and I found that my thinking and his propositions were almost the same. It seemed that I had put forward a preliminary plan for the "political design institute" from the local level. Now I realize that my thinking is definitely extremely wrong revisionist thinking.

　　The China Democratic League organization is not like the Party's assistant, but more like the Party's opponent or enemy.

Although I have not widely discussed these opinions, I have put forward my views in some places, especially in the branch meeting of the Sichuan Agricultural College, thus, consciously or unconsciously, promoting the erroneous ideas of some comrades. For example, in Ya'an, some comrades of grass-roots organizations believed that "accepting the leadership of the Party and ensuring the completion of administrative tasks" could not meet the requirements of the work, and I supported this view without any analysis. Recently, when the comrades of the Agricultural College branch studied problems with the comrades of the Party committee, they not only did not consider understanding the intentions of the Party and accepting the leadership of the Party, but almost completely adopted an opposing attitude, and even things like questioning and slapping the table happened. Some comrades felt that we are not only not like the Party's assistants, but more like the Party's "opponents," or even "enemies." In addition, when the China Democratic League comrades in higher education institutions discussed the school system, quite a few comrades advocated that the school should be completely "diagnosed" by insiders and experts, which is also a reflection of this ideological tendency.

Why did I get infected with or accept the influence of revisionist ideas without realizing it? First, it shows that there are still problems with my ideological remolding and my ideological awareness is not high. Secondly, I must also point out that my erroneous thinking has obviously become prominent recently, and has been systematically expressed in the suggestions for the work of the Ya'an Municipal Committee, mainly because I have been influenced by this kind of thinking within our league. Recently, many strange fallacies have appeared on the platform of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League's group meetings. In fact, I think that this is not only the case now, but also at the national work conference convened by the Central Committee of the League in April this year, the revisionist thinking headed by Comrades Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji had already appeared in large quantities. To illustrate this point, I give the following main examples:

　　One-sidedly emphasized opposing dogmatism, completely ignoring the remolding of intellectuals.

First, that meeting emphasized the idea of opposing dogmatism on the ideological front, and placed the opposition to revisionism and opportunism in a secondary position. Shen Zhiyuan said when conveying the spirit of the National Propaganda Conference convened by the CPC Central Committee: "The main focus of the ideological front at present is to oppose dogmatism." Therefore, the China Democratic League mechanically moved this principle over. To be realistic, it is appropriate to put forward the opposition to dogmatism within the working class party today because the general position problem has been solved. However, within the democratic parties, because many wrong views and ideas still exist, if the main focus is used to oppose dogmatism, some people will inevitably use the pretext of opposing dogmatism to promote revisionism, and use opposing dogmatism to peddle revisionism.

Second, at that meeting, some comrades made wrong estimates on the issue of intellectuals. They overemphasized the characteristics of intellectuals, showing a tendency of accommodation. For example, they said that the main problem of intellectuals now is that the Party should make things clear; they believed that Chinese intellectuals have the characteristics of understanding righteousness and restraining themselves; they believed that the Party neglected academic leadership and could not meet the correct wishes of intellectuals; they emphasized that intellectuals should be treated with "courtesy and humility, and visited three times." The most typical is: represented by Comrade Luo Longji, who believes that today's problem of intellectuals is "the contradiction between petty intellectuals of the proletariat and big intellectuals of the petty bourgeoisie," and believes that only big intellectuals of the proletariat like Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou can do the work of senior intellectuals, which actually means that the party's cadres do not understand intellectuals and do not understand knowledge. The main error of this series of views is that they do not point out that intellectuals should accept the leadership of the Party, but that the Party should "visit three times"; they do not point out that intellectuals should conduct in-depth self-remolding, and completely inappropriately emphasize the so-called "excellent" traditions of intellectuals. In fact, it is a disservice to intellectuals.

Third, some negative opinions were reflected on social democratic life at that meeting. Recently, some comrades in Beijing have criticized some remarks of Comrade Zhang Bojun, such as Comrade Zhang Bojun's saying: "Just sitting in a car, living in a good house, and eating well does not solve the problem." This reflects his dissatisfaction with socialist democratic life. When Comrade Zhang Bojun made a report on his visit abroad to all the comrades attending the meeting, he pointed out that a major problem internationally at present is the problem of peace, the problem of unity, the problem of life, and the problem of production. He particularly emphasized that the problem of life should not only meet the requirements of material life, but also pay attention to spiritual life, and pay attention to democracy and human dignity. The implication is also that he feels dissatisfied with the democratic life in recent years.

　　Zhang Bojun advocated that the China Democratic League should develop to 500,000 this year.
He also promoted the idea of starting from the middle line and opposing the Communist Party.

Fourth, at that meeting, many unprincipled opinions appeared in the work of democratic parties. This was particularly evident in Comrades Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Luo Longji particularly emphasized that the work of democratic parties should be straightened out. The so-called straightening out he referred to was to make all the treatments of the ministers at the central level of democratic parties the same as those of the ministers of the State Council, and the ministers of the democratic parties at the provincial level should be the same as the directors of the provincial people's committees. Zhang Bojun advocated that the China Democratic League should develop to 500,000 members this year, and said that he was "opportunistic": he would develop the organization whenever he had the opportunity. In his speech to all the comrades, Zhang Bojun also mentioned the story of "Duke Zhou assisting King Cheng," meaning that the democratic parties have matured in the past year. If the Party continues to fail to let go as in the past, it will make mistakes, just like the relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Comrade Zhang Bojun even absurdly said: "Only two of China's democratic parties started on their own: the Democratic League started by taking the middle line, and the Third Party (the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) started by opposing the Communist Party." He used a very wrong point of view to encourage the emotions of cadres.

The many views mentioned above do not conform to the spirit of socialism, seriously neglect the leadership of the Party, and are a concentrated and prominent reflection of revisionist thinking within the League. Because that meeting did not have the conditions to clarify those wrong ideas, some leaders of the League, such as Comrade Pan Dakui, and cadres, including myself, were adversely affected, and this has been reflected in the work of the China Democratic League during this recent period. For example, Pan Dakui did not distinguish between right and wrong on various ideas related to the issue of intellectuals. When he conveyed the spirit of the national work conference to the League members of Chengdu higher education institutions, he doubled the emphasis on the characteristics of intellectuals on the issue of intellectuals, and also praised the integrity of some intellectuals. He also supported many of Comrade Luo Longji's views. Recently, someone criticized his views on the work of redressing unjust, false, and wrongly judged cases, mainly because he supported Luo Longji's views.

Now, with the deepening of the movement to assist the Party's rectification, we have a good opportunity to clarify various wrong views. I fully agree that the China Democratic League, from the central to the local level, resolutely rises up to criticize all remarks and ideas that violate socialist interests, and launches a serious ideological struggle within the League, so that the China Democratic League turns from right to left.

Some comrades may think that it is not a good thing that this ideological struggle has been launched within the League. Some people say: "How can the Party's rectification be carried out on our heads!" I believe that on the road to advancing towards socialism, in the process of intellectuals' remolding, it is inevitable to struggle with wrong ideas (including one's own ideas). Truth can only be obtained in the struggle with fallacy. As long as we do not persist in wrong opinions, we will surely improve our awareness in extensive discussions and debates, on the one hand, to improve our understanding.

　　Past history proves that the China Democratic League must achieve development.
It must overcome the wrong line under the leadership of the Party.

Some comrades may also think that this ideological struggle within the League will bring adverse effects to the League's organization, such as someone wanting to withdraw from the League, and someone saying that it will be difficult to develop the organization in the future. Judging from the history of the China Democratic League's development, for more than ten years, under the leadership of the Party, at every important stage of historical development, we have always achieved development after constantly overcoming various wrong lines. In 1945, the China Democratic League resolutely eliminated the pro-Chiang Kai-shek and pro-imperialist lines of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, and took a step forward; in 1947, the Third Plenary Session resolutely abandoned the middle line and put forward the program of anti-Chiang, anti-American, and supporting land reform, and the China Democratic League took another step forward; in 1949, it cleared up the old democratic ideas that occupied a dominant position within the League, determined to accept the leadership of the working class vanguard Communist Party, and determined to take the Common Program as its own program, and we began to participate in the ranks of the socialist revolution. Now, just as the socialist transformation in the country has achieved a decisive victory, the large-scale class struggle has basically ended, and we are in a period of profound and great changes, we resolutely draw a clear line with revisionist thinking, sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, and be loyal to the socialist cause. The comrades of the China Democratic League will unite on a new basis, and the China Democratic League will move forward and make more contributions to the great cause of socialist construction.

### 民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明  揭露右派在民盟四月会议上的活动

　　民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明
　　揭露右派在民盟四月会议上的活动
    本报特约新华社成都17日电　民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明在中共四川省委统战部6月15日召集的座谈会上的发言，揭露了右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基在今年4月民盟中央召集的全国工作会议上的活动和这些活动对于民盟地方组织的恶劣影响。他的发言原文（略有删节）如下：
    最近民盟内部已经展开了对反社会主义言论和对修正主义的斗争，对章伯钧、罗隆基同志的修正主义思想进行了驳斥，提出了民盟必须从右向左转。各方面的意见对于我有很大的启发，我曾经联系自己的思想和工作进行了慎重的考虑，发现我的思想上也存在一些修正主义的思想，我感到必须自觉地批判错误认识，划清思想界限。
　　对于民盟工作的建议根本否认了党的领导
    前一个月我到雅安去了解民盟的工作，在日常工作的报告上，对于雅安民盟市委的工作提出了若干意见和改进工作的建议。关于参加政治协商的工作，我提出首先要确定参加政治协商的范围。我认为凡是有关国家各项重大方针在全市范围内贯彻，党与民主党派应进行协商；有关市内重大的人事安排应进行协商；市内重要的会议如人代会，市政协的召开应进行协商；各方面发生的重大的关系问题应进行协商；各方面提出的重要建议应进行协商；共同组织的活动如视察应进行协商。其次，应该确定进行政治协商的形式。我认为，政协应该是进行政治协商的主要形式。除此，党派联席会议、市人民委员会的会议及各种不定形式的交换意见都是协商的形式；各个党派的负责人应该加强联系，党委可以约集民主党派负责人交换意见，民主党派也可以邀请党委负责同志交换意见。再其次，要改进政治协商的方法。我主张应该根据问题的性质，采取多种不同的办法进行协商工作。有的问题可以事先通知进行协商的主要内容；有的问题必须提供必要的参考资料；有的问题先行交付民主党派讨论，或组织调查研究工作，和广泛搜集群众的意见。对于协商的方案，我认为可由党委提出，可由政府提出，也可由民主党派提出。关于进行协商工作的办法，我主张可由一方面提出初步的方案；也可以由各方面提出方案；还可以就提出的问题各方面发表意见，共同拟订方案。关于参加协商的人员主要是各党派、各方面的负责人；也可以根据问题的性质，扩大范围，吸收更多的人员参加协商；有些问题还可以由各方面的上级派人协助协商工作。此外，我们还对参加文教事务管理工作、对成员的教育管理工作、推动基层工作、广泛联系群众工作提出了许多意见。
    最近，自己检查那段时间的工作，我发现自己提出的工作意见没有任何一个地方提到了党的领导。我也检查到我所提出的意见有两个根本的错误思想在指导自己：第一，突出地强调了党和民主党派的平行地位；第二，强调了民主党派要参加国家的决策工作。这些思想从实质上来看，虽然没有正面否定党的领导，但在具体工作上取消了党的领导地位。我曾经把章伯钧的所谓“政治设计院”的精神与我自己对民盟工作的看法比较一下，我发现我的思想和他的主张几乎是一脉相通，我好像已经从地方提出了“政治设计院”的初步方案。现在我认识我的这种思想肯定是极端错误的修正主义思想。
　　民盟组织不像党的助手反而像党的对手或敌手
    我的这些意见虽然没有广泛地谈过，但在有些地方特别是在四川农学院支部会议上提出了自己的看法，因而有形无形地助长了某些同志的错误思想。例如，在雅安时有的基层组织的同志认为“接受党的领导，保证完成行政任务”不能满足工作要求，我就不加分析地支持这种意见。最近农学院支部的同志与党委的同志研究问题不仅没有考虑到体会党的意图，接受党的领导，几乎完全采取了对立的态度，甚至质问、拍桌子之类的事情都发生了。有的同志感到我们不仅不像党的助手，反而像党的“对手”，甚至是“敌手”一样。此外，高等学校民盟同志讨论学校体制问题，竟有相当多的同志主张学校应该完全由内行、专家“拿脉”，也是这种思想倾向的反应。
    为什么我会沾染了或者接受了修正主义的思想影响而不自觉呢？首先，说明自己的思想改造还有问题，思想觉悟不高。其次，我还不能不提出，我的这种错误思想最近显然突出，比较系统的表现在对雅安市委工作的建议上，主要是在我们盟内受了这种思想的影响。最近在民盟中央小组会议的讲台上曾经出现了许多奇怪的谬论。实际上，我认为不仅现在有这种情况，就是在今年4月盟中央召开的全国工作会议上，章伯钧、罗隆基同志为首的修正主义思想已经大量出现了。为了说明这个问题，我举下面几个主要例子：
　　片面强调反对教条主义完全不提知识分子改造
    一、那次会议强调了在思想战线上要反对教条主义的思想，把反对修正主义、机会主义摆在次要的地位。沈志远在传达中共中央召开的全国宣传会议时说：“当前思想战线上的主要锋芒是反对教条主义”。因而民盟把这个方针生硬地搬过来。实事求是地说，工人阶级政党内部由于一般立场问题已经解决了，在今天提出反对教条主义是恰当的。但在民主党派内部，由于很多错误观点、思想还存在，如果把主要的锋芒用来反对教条主义，必然会有一些人在反对教条主义的借口下来宣传修正主义，用反对教条主义来贩卖修正主义。
    二、那次会议有些同志对知识分子问题作了错误的估计。过分强调了知识分子特点，表现了一种迁就的倾向。如说现在知识分子问题，主要是党把话讲清楚；认为中国知识分子有深明大义、克己复礼的特点；认为党忽视学术领导，不能满足知识分子的正确愿望；强调要对知识分子“礼贤下士，三顾茅庐”。最典型的是：以罗隆基同志为代表的认为今天知识分子的问题是“无产阶级小知识分子和小资产阶级大知识分子工作的矛盾”，认为要像毛主席、刘委员长、周总理这些无产阶级的大知识分子才能作高级知识分子的工作，这实际上就是认为党的干部不懂知识分子，不懂知识。这一系列观点的主要错误，就是没有指出知识分子要接受党的领导，而要党去“三顾茅庐”；没有指出知识分子要深入进行自我改造，完全不恰当地强调了知识分子的所谓“优良”传统。实际上给知识分子帮了倒忙。
    三、在那次会议中对社会民主生活反映了一些否定的意见。最近北京有同志批判章伯钧同志的一些言论，如像章伯钧同志说：“只坐汽车，住好房子，吃得好，还不解决问题。”反映了他对社会主义民主生活的不满。章伯钧同志在向出席会议的全体同志作出国访问报告时，指出了当前国际上一个主要的问题是和平问题、团结问题、生活问题、生产问题等。他特别强调生活问题不仅要满足物质生活的要求，还要注意精神生活，注意民主与人的尊严。言下之意也有对几年来的民主生活感到不满足。
　　章伯钧主张民盟今年发展到五十万
    还宣传靠中间路线和反共起家
    四、那次会议中在民主党派的工作上出现了许多没有原则的意见。特别表现在章伯钧、罗隆基同志的身上。罗隆基特别强调要把民主党派的工作摆正，他所谓地摆正就是要使民主党派中央级的部长的一切待遇要与国务院的部长一样，省一级的民主党派的部长要与省人民委员会的厅长一样。章伯钧主张要在今年内使民盟发展到五十万盟员，并且说他就是“机会主义”：一有机会就要发展组织。章伯钧在对全体同志的讲话中还提到“周公辅成王”的故事，意思说，一年来民主党派已经成熟，如果党再要像以往那样不放手，就会犯错误，就会像苏联与南斯拉夫的关系一样。章伯钧同志甚至荒谬地说：“中国的民主党派只有两个是靠自己起家的：民主同盟靠走中间路线起家，第三党（农工民主党）靠反共起家。”以十分错误的观点来鼓励干部的情绪。
    上面所说的许多观点，都不符合社会主义的精神，严重地忽视了党的领导，是修正主义思想在盟内集中的突出的反映。由于那次会议没有条件来澄清那些错误的思想，因而盟的有些领导人如像潘大逵同志和干部，包括我自己，都受了不良的影响，并且已经反映在最近这段期间民盟的工作上。例如，潘大逵对有关知识分子的问题的各种思想，正确与否就完全不加分辨，他在向成都高等学校盟员传达全国工作会议的精神时，在关于知识分子问题上，加倍地强调知识分子的特点，还颂扬了某些知识分子的骨气。他还对于罗隆基同志的许多观点加以支持。最近有人批评他关于平反工作的意见，主要就是支持罗隆基的意见。
    现在，随着协助党的整风运动的深入，我们有了很好的时机来澄清各种错误观点。我完全赞成民盟的中央到地方，坚决起来批判一切违反社会主义利益的言论、思想，在盟内展开严肃的思想斗争，使民盟从右向左转。
    可能有同志认为盟内展开了这场思想斗争是不好的事情。有人说：“党的整风怎么会搞在我们的头上呵！”我认为在向社会主义前进的道路上，在知识分子的改造过程中，同错误的思想（包括自己的思想）作斗争是不可避免的事情。真理是在同谬误斗争中才能获得的。只要不坚持错误意见，我们就一定会在广泛的讨论和争鸣中提高觉悟，一方面是提高认识。
　　过去历史证明民盟要获得发展
    必须在党的领导下克服错误路线
    也可能有同志认为这次盟内的思想斗争会给盟的组织带来不好的影响，如有人要退盟，有人说今后发展组织有困难了。从民盟发展的历史来看，十几年来，我们在党的领导下，在各个历史发展的重要阶段，总是在不断地克服了各种错误路线之后，才得到了发展的。1945年，民盟坚决清除了青年党、民社党的投靠蒋介石、投靠帝国主义路线之后，前进了一步；1947年，三中全会坚决抛弃了中间路线，提出反蒋、反美、拥护土地改革的纲领，民盟又前进了一步；1949年，又清算了在盟内占统治地位的旧民主主义的思想，确定了接受工人阶级先锋队共产党的领导，确定以共同纲领作为自己的纲领，我们开始参加社会主义革命的行列。现在，正当国内社会主义改造取得决定性的胜利，大规模的阶级斗争已经基本结束，正处在深刻地大变动时期，我们坚决同修正主义思想划清界限，诚心诚意地接受党的领导，忠实于社会主义事业，民盟的同志将在新的基础上团结起来，民盟将会更加前进一步，在社会主义建设的伟大事业中作出更多的贡献。
