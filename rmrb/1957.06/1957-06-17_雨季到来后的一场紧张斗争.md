　　A Tense Struggle After the Arrival of the Rainy Season
　　In many parts of our country, the rainy season has arrived, and the flood season has come; in other areas, however, drought persists. Too much water is a problem, requiring flood control and drainage; too little water is also a problem, requiring water diversion and irrigation. In these areas, people are facing or have already engaged in a tense struggle against nature. This struggle directly affects the interests of the broad masses of the people; disputes often arise between regions because of this. This kind of dispute is a contradiction among the people. If handled well, it will be mutually beneficial and beneficial to the whole; if handled poorly, it may expand the disaster and deepen the contradiction. Because these disputes directly relate to the lives and production of many people, it is very easy to agitate the emotions of the masses and develop into conflicts and fights. Some disputes are historical. In order to avoid causing major losses, disputes that have occurred in the past should be dealt with correctly and promptly, and measures should be taken as early as possible to prevent possible disputes. In the rectification movement, this work must not be neglected in the slightest; instead, it should be done better with the spirit of rectification and the spirit of correctly resolving contradictions among the people.
　　Disputes over irrigation water mainly involve upstream and downstream competition for water sources. For example, on both sides of the South Grand Canal in Hebei Province, Tianjin originally had 230,000 mu of paddy fields, and Hebei Province had more than 100,000 mu of paddy fields. This year, Tianjin and Cangxian prefectures in Hebei Province have developed a total of 450,000 mu of paddy fields, in addition to more than 100,000 mu of dry rice and lake rice, all of which need to be irrigated to wash away alkali. The amount of water in the South Grand Canal is limited. If the upstream uses more water, it will seriously affect the irrigation of the original paddy fields downstream. Although this dispute has been initially resolved, it has already caused losses. In Tianjin's Xiaozhan area, 230,000 mu of paddy fields were completely transplanted from Xiaoman to Mangzhong last year. This year, due to water shortage, only 10,000 mu have been transplanted and 110,000 mu have been washed with alkali, and the rest have not yet been washed. In the Tianjin prefecture of Hebei, some rice seedlings have also died due to drought, and some of the 7,000 mu of dry direct-sown rice fields have also died due to drought. What a painful lesson! The masses who have suffered will naturally be very dissatisfied; reduced grain production will increase the contradiction between supply and demand.
　　Disputes in flood control and drainage often occur when some areas only consider relieving the water disaster in their own area, and the upstream blindly digs ditches for drainage, regardless of the interests of the downstream, while the downstream builds dams to block and prevent the water from flowing downstream. Or, in the case of a river, there are conflicting interests between the left and right banks. When a breach occurs on the left bank during a flood, the right bank can be safe. Therefore, the masses on both banks often suspect each other, and even engage in conflicts. These areas often do not communicate and negotiate in advance, and attack and accuse each other afterwards. For example, the drainage disputes in Qingxian, Jinghai, and Huanghua in Hebei Province, the disputes in Pingyu, Xincai in Henan Province and Linquan County in Anhui Province, the disputes between Henan and Hebei provinces regarding the flood control of the Zhang River, and the drainage disputes between Xinye in Henan Province and Xiangyang in Hubei Province have all been disputed for a long time, and some have even engaged in armed fights. Some of the disputes in these areas have been initially resolved, and some have not yet been resolved. If they are not resolved properly and in a timely manner, not only will antagonism be formed between cadres and the masses in various places, but also major losses of life and property will be caused when the flood season arrives.
　　The main reason for these water conservancy disputes is that we cannot completely control and eliminate natural disasters. Therefore, it is impossible to completely eliminate water conservancy disputes in the short term. However, it should also be noted that the contradiction between man and nature is often deepened due to the improper handling of contradictions between people.
　　Some cadres have adopted an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards water conservancy disputes. They believe that since most of these disputes are historical and difficult to completely eliminate at present, they can not bear any responsibility; some are even afraid that the two sides of the dispute will say that they are biased, and that they are "stuck in the middle and suffer," so they turn a blind eye, do not lead, do not solve, and "dodge" if they can, and "drag" if they can. Some cadres neither investigate and study the possible water conservancy disputes in advance, nor seriously investigate and study after the disputes occur, cannot distinguish right from wrong, cannot find the most appropriate way to resolve the contradictions, and arbitrarily decide the treatment plan based only on the opinions and impressions of a few people. This subjective style is not conducive to solving problems, but often expands the contradictions. Therefore, when resolving water conservancy disputes, the first thing to recognize is that this is an important issue directly related to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people, and it is necessary to conduct serious investigations and research, understand the situation in all aspects and the historical situation in detail, the opinions of this group of people and the opinions of that group of people, and seek methods to reduce the disasters of both sides to varying degrees, and oppose sloppy and procrastinating subjective and bureaucratic practices.
　　In water conservancy disputes, sectarian tendencies that do not proceed from unity occur more often. In the prevention of disasters and the construction of water conservancy measures, there are situations that proceed from local interests. Cadres with this kind of thinking often believe that their own views are correct, are not aware that their own opinions are one-sided, and blindly distrust the relevant parties, fearing that they will suffer losses. In the past, some water conservancy disputes between the two provinces could not be resolved for a long time. After adjusting the provincial boundaries and assigning the relevant areas to the jurisdiction of one province, the disputes were resolved. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the sense of responsibility and strengthening investigation and research work, the most important thing is to overcome the localism of some local cadres. When such disputes occur, both parties should negotiate calmly in the spirit of unity and mutual benefit to seek a reasonable solution. In the case where the interests of both parties cannot be reconciled, it is necessary to follow the spirit that small interests should obey big interests, big interests should properly take care of small interests, the part should obey the whole, and the whole should properly take care of the part, and make concessions to each other. Leading organs and cadres must not lightly believe the one-sided reflections of the cadres and the masses in their own areas, and should not only consider the interests of their own areas, but also consider the interests of the other party at the same time. It is necessary to investigate the actual situation in a realistic way and study solutions that can be accepted by both parties, instead of acting emotionally and impulsively. At the same time, it is necessary to patiently persuade the masses to make concessions to each other and take the overall situation into consideration. In order to reduce water conservancy disputes, it is necessary to advocate direct contact and consultation in case of trouble. On the issue of flood control, where disputes often occur between neighboring provinces and counties, joint defense organizations should be established to exchange information regularly and negotiate defense measures in advance to avoid mutual suspicion or temporary disputes. On the issue of drainage, there must be a comprehensive plan. Where possible, local interception and storage should be combined with appropriate drainage to avoid indiscriminate digging and blocking, which may lead to conflicts. On the issue of irrigation water, a unified management organization or water allocation organization should be established through consultation in areas where water use relations are close in the same river section, so as to rationally coordinate and regulate the amount of water. In the dry season when water use is tight, it is even more necessary to persuade the masses to proceed from unity and mutual benefit, strive for rational water use, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

### 雨季到来后的一场紧张斗争

　　雨季到来后的一场紧张斗争
    在我国许多地区，雨季又到了，汛期又来了；在另一些地区，却仍然有干旱的现象。水太多了是问题，要防洪排涝；水太少了也是问题，要引水灌溉。在这些地区，人们正面临着或者已经投入了对大自然的一场紧张的斗争。这场斗争直接涉及广大人民群众的利益；地区与地区之间，往往因此发生纠纷。这种纠纷，是一种人民内部矛盾。处理得好，就会做到相互有利，整体有利；处理得不好，也可能扩大灾害，加深矛盾。因为这些纠纷直接关系到许多人民的生活和生产，所以非常容易激动群众的情绪，发展成为冲突斗殴。有些纠纷是有历史性的。为了避免造成重大损失，对于过去已经发生的纠纷应该及时正确处理，对于可能发生的纠纷应该及早设法防止。在整风运动中，决不可对于这项工作稍有忽视，而应该用整风的精神、用正确解决人民内部矛盾的精神，把这项工作做得更好。
    灌溉用水的纠纷，主要是上下游争用水源。如河北省南运河两岸，原来天津市有稻田二十三万亩，河北省有稻田十余万亩。今年河北省天津和沧县两个专区共发展稻田四十五万亩，另外还有陆稻、淀稻十余万亩，都需要引水洗碱和灌溉。南运河水量有限，上游用水多，就严重地影响了下游原有稻田的灌溉。这个纠纷虽然已经初步解决，但是已经造成了损失。天津小站二十三万亩稻田，去年从小满至芒种，就全部插秧完毕，今年由于缺水，至今只有一万亩插秧、十一万亩洗碱，其余尚未洗碱。河北天津专区的稻田，也有一部分稻秧旱死，旱直播的七千亩稻田，也旱死了一部分。这是多么惨痛的教训！身受其害的群众，自然会很不满意；粮食减产了，又会增加供求矛盾。
    防洪排水方面的纠纷，往往是有些地区只考虑到解除本地区的水灾，上游盲目地挖沟排水，不顾下游的利益，下游则筑坝堵截，不让水流下泄。或者是一条河流，左右岸利害矛盾，在洪水涨发时期，左岸发生决口，右岸即可得安全，因而两岸群众常常互相疑猜，甚或发生冲突。这些地区，往往事先不相联系协商，事后互相攻讦控告。例如河北省青县、静海、黄骅排水纠纷，河南省平舆、新蔡和安徽临泉县的纠纷，河南、河北两省关于漳河防洪的纠纷，河南省新野与湖北省襄阳排水的纠纷，都经过长期争执，相持不下，有的甚至挟械斗殴。这些地区的纠纷，有的已经初步解决，有的至今还未解决。如果不及时地妥善地解决，不仅会在各地干部群众之间形成对立，汛期到来，还会造成生命财产的重大损失。
    这些水利纠纷发生的原因，主要的是我们还不能完全控制和消除自然的灾害。因此，要在短期内完全消除水利纠纷，也是不可能的。但是，也不能不看到，往往由于人与人之间的矛盾处理得不妥当，而加深了人与自然之间的矛盾。
    有些干部对于水利纠纷采取了不负责任的官僚主义态度，他们认为，既然这些纠纷大都是有历史性的，目前也是难以完全消除的，自己就可以不负什么责任；有的还怕纠纷的双方说自己偏袒，怕自己“夹在中间受气”，就听之任之，不去领导，不去解决，能“躲”就“躲”，能“拖”就“拖”。有些干部事先既不调查研究可能发生水利纠纷的情况，发生了纠纷之后仍然不认真地调查研究，分不清是非，找不出最妥当的解决矛盾的办法，自以为是地只凭少数人的意见和印象决定处理方案。这种主观主义的作风，不但不利于解决问题，还往往会扩大矛盾。因此，在解决水利纠纷的时候，首先应该认识，这是直接关涉广大人民的切身利害的重要问题，必须认真地进行调查研究，详细了解各方面的情况和历史上的情况，这部分人的意见和那部分人的意见，寻求在不同程度上减轻双方灾害的方法，反对马虎草率、推宕拖延的主观主义和官僚主义做法。
    在水利纠纷中，更常发生的是不从团结出发的宗派主义倾向。在防止灾害和兴办水利的措施上，都有从局部利益出发的情形。有这种思想的干部往往认为自己的看法是正确的，不自觉自己的意见有片面性，而且对于有关的对方盲目地不信任，唯恐自己吃了亏。过去有些两省之间的水利纠纷长期不得解决，在调整省界把有关地区划归一省管辖以后，纠纷就解决了。因此，除了加强责任心、加强调查研究工作以外，最重要的是克服一些地方干部的本位主义思想。在发生这种纠纷的时候，双方都要本着团结互利的精神，平心静气地协商，求得合理的解决。在双方利益不能两全的情况下，要本小利服从大利、大利适当照顾小利、局部服从整体、整体适当照顾局部的精神，互相让步。领导机关和干部，切不可轻信本地区干部和群众的片面的反映，不应该仅仅考虑本地区的利益，而要同时考虑对方的利益。必须实事求是地调查实际情况、研究双方可以接受的解决方案，而不要逞意气，动感情。同时，要耐心地说服群众互相让步，顾全大局。为了减少水利纠纷，要提倡遇事直接联系协商。在防洪问题上，凡邻省、邻县经常发生纠纷的地方，要建立联防机构，经常交换情况，事先协商防御措施，避免互相疑猜或临时发生争执。在排涝问题上，必须有全面的规划，在可能的情况下，要做到就地拦蓄和适当排泄相结合，以免乱挖乱堵，发生冲突。在灌溉用水上，要尽可能在同一河段用水关系密切的地区，根据实际需要，通过协商成立统一的管理组织或水量调配组织，以便合理地统筹调节水量。在天气干旱用水紧张的季节，更要说服群众，从团结互利出发，力求合理用水，争取全面丰收。
