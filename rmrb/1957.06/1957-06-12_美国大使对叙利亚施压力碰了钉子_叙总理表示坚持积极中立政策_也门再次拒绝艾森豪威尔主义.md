Xinhua News Agency, June 11th -- Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali emphasized to the US Ambassador on the 10th that Syria would adhere to its policy of active neutrality.

Al-Assali stated that any pressure exerted by Western countries on Syria would only make Syria more determined to implement this policy.

According to Agence France-Presse, citing well-informed sources, Al-Assali made these remarks during a meeting with US Ambassador Moose at the latter's request.

These well-informed sources said that Moose clarified the US's attitude towards issues concerning Arab countries and Israel during the meeting, especially the US's view on the "free passage" of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal. Al-Assali explained Syria's adherence to its policy of active neutrality, and he also discussed with Moose the Israeli aggression in the demilitarized zone and the issue of Israel building a bridge in this area.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 11th -- According to the Middle East News Agency (MENA) dispatch from Taiz: Yemen once again informed the US delegation on June 10th of its refusal to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine and US aid.

The delegation, led by the US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, received notification from the Yemeni authorities before departing Yemen, stating that Yemen could not relinquish its sovereignty to accept aid. If the United States truly wished to help, it should help Yemen resolve the issue of the "Aden Protectorate."

Yemen has repeatedly stated that the "Aden Protectorate" is Yemeni territory occupied by Britain. It has proposed direct negotiations with Britain to resolve the dispute, but Britain has rejected this proposal and continues to use force to threaten and invade Yemen.

　　美国大使对叙利亚施压力碰了钉子
　　叙总理表示坚持积极中立政策
　　也门再次拒绝艾森豪威尔主义
    新华社11日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利10日对美国大使强调说，叙利亚要坚持它的积极中立政策。
    阿萨利说，西方国家对叙利亚施加的任何压力，只会使叙利亚更加坚强地执行这种政策。
    据法新社援引消息灵通人士的谈话说，阿萨利是在应美国大使穆斯的请求同他会谈时说这些话的。
    这些消息灵通人士说，穆斯在会谈时表明了美国对有关阿拉伯国家和以色列问题的态度，特别是表明了美国对以色列船只“自由通行”苏伊士运河的看法。而阿萨利说明了叙利亚要坚持积极中立政策，他还同穆斯讨论了以色列在非军事区的侵略行为以及以色列在这个地区修筑一座桥梁的问题。
    新华社开罗11日电  据中东通讯社泰兹消息：也门已经在6月10日再次向美国代表团表示拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义和美国援助。
    以美国驻沙特阿拉伯大使为首的代表团在动身离开也门以前接到也门当局的通知说，也门不能放弃自己的主权来接受援助，如果美国真愿意给予帮助，那么就请它帮助也门来解决“亚丁保护地”的问题。
    也门曾经一再申明“亚丁保护地”是英国占领的也门领土，它建议同英国举行直接谈判来解决争端，但是英国拒绝这种建议，并且不断使用武力来威胁和侵犯也门。
