Wu Han's Speech Criticizes Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji

Zhang Bojun's proposal to create a separate political design institute: Does he disagree with the Constitution?

Luo Longji's proposal to establish a separate rehabilitation organization indicates distrust of the Party's leadership.

Chu Anping's "Party Empire" argument is a vicious slander.

Ye Duyi's opinion is effectively advocating for the abolition of political parties.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Wu Han, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, stated at a symposium of the China People's University branch of the Democratic League on the evening of the 9th that he disagreed with the opinions of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, Ye Duyi, and others. Yesterday, Wu Han met with reporters and discussed his views on the opinions of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

    Wu Han said that Zhang Bojun stated that there are many design institutes in the industrial field, but none in the political field. He requested that the CPPCC, the NPC, the democratic parties, and people's organizations form a political design institute. This statement is difficult to understand. The preamble to the Constitution states that China's united front is led by the Communist Party. The CPPCC charter also states that it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's leadership and core role. All democratic parties also recognize the Communist Party's leadership role over the democratic parties. Leadership should mean leadership in major political and ideological issues. If we abandon this leadership and create a separate political design institute, what does this mean? Does it mean disagreement with the spirit of the Constitution and the CPPCC charter, and dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Communist Party? Wu Han said: Now, the state's major measures are discussed by all democratic parties. The NPC and CPPCC hold annual meetings, and the NPC Standing Committee holds monthly meetings. Zhang Bojun participated in these meetings, and he should understand the discussions. Now he wants to create a political design institute; does this mean that he believes these organizations have not played a role? Does he have different views on the core role of the Communist Party? This is also difficult to understand. Therefore, I disagree with his opinion. Zhang Bojun also said that State Council meetings often present finished products and ask everyone for their opinions. He believes that such meetings are a formality. Lu Yuwen has already introduced the actual situation of the State Council meetings in his speech, so I will not say more. However, there are indeed two different methods for holding meetings. One is to prepare in advance, solicit opinions, and then present a relatively mature plan for everyone to discuss. The other is the British and American parliamentary style. They often seize on an issue for long-term debate, with no result. Of course, the discussions in the British and American parliaments are not without preparation, and the discussions in the cabinet cannot be said to be without preparation. In short, does Zhang Bojun's way of raising the issue mean that he is not interested in or has doubts about the socialist political system? Therefore, I cannot agree with his opinion.

    Wu Han said that Luo Longji, in his speech, advocated that the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should establish a committee. This committee should not only check the deviations in the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Purge" campaigns, but also make public statements to encourage everyone to report their grievances. This "rehabilitation" organization must be separated from the leadership organizations of the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Purge" campaigns, because these campaigns were led by the Communist Party in the past. When "rehabilitating," in addition to the leading party, all democratic parties and non-party人士 should participate. Wu Han said: This opinion involves two issues: one is that he distrusts the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," "Purge," and other organizations led by the Party. The other is that he downgrades or changes the National People's Congress, a legislative body with supreme power, and the National Political Consultative Conference, a consultative body, into judicial and administrative organs, which is inconsistent with the nature of these two organs. Luo Longji also talked about the issue of democratic parties developing their organizations. He said that the Communist Party's past development targets were mainly workers and peasants, while democratic parties mainly developed among the old intellectuals (in fact, intellectuals). Now that the Communist Party also wants to develop intellectual party members, the democratic parties will have nothing to do. Wu Han said that, according to Luo Longji, intellectuals should all join democratic parties and not join the Communist Party, which is inconsistent with the current situation and demands of progressive intellectuals in China. The original purpose of the democratic parties' work over the years was to assist the Communist Party in uniting and educating intellectuals. Now that the political awareness of some intellectuals has improved, many people have joined the Communist Party. This should make us happy. Therefore, my opinion is inconsistent with Luo Longji's. Luo Longji also said that those who participate in the democratic parties now are all over thirty or forty years old, and the democratic parties may have no successors in the future, which contradicts the requirement for the long-term existence of the democratic parties. This statement is also inconsistent with the facts. Intellectuals are generally older because knowledge is constantly accumulated, and people who are too young cannot have a certain level of knowledge. If democratic parties do not develop young people, but only develop people over thirty or forty years old, can they not exist for a long time? I believe that the key to whether democratic parties can exist for a long time lies in their political stance, not in the age of their development targets. Young people will grow into middle-aged people, and they will also grow into old people. From this point of view, the development prospects of democratic parties cannot and should not conflict with the development of the Communist Party.

    Wu Han said: Chu Anping made a very noteworthy speech, and the purpose of this speech was to abandon the leadership of the Party and oppose the socialist direction. He put forward the term "Party Empire." People who lived in the era of Kuomintang rule all know that the "Party Empire" at that time was the "Chiang family's empire and the Chen family's party." How can this be compared with today's people's empire? This is a vicious slander. Now, aren't there many members of democratic parties, including members of the Democratic League, participating in the National People's Congress, the CPPCC, and the People's Congresses and CPPCCs at all levels? Aren't there many League members serving as ministers in the central ministries and as vice governors and vice mayors in provinces and cities? How can this be said to be a "Party Empire"? Chu Anping said that "the ideological problem of 'Party Empire' is the ultimate source of all sectarianism," which is extremely reactionary. He blames all phenomena on sectarianism. Sectarianism must be eliminated. Doesn't the meaning of his words mean that to eliminate sectarianism, the Communist Party must be eliminated, thereby effectively abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party? Everyone knows that the National People's Congress is the highest organ of power. The Premier is elected by the National People's Congress. We have all elected him, and Chu Anping has also elected him. If you say this now, aren't you afraid of the people questioning: "How did you become a representative?" Some people admire Chu Anping's "courage." I can't help but ask: Is courage used to deal with the enemy, or to deal with the people? Is it to safeguard socialism, or to undermine socialism? This question should be clearly distinguished first.

    Wu Han said that Ye Duyi said in his speech that the Party committee system in universities should be changed, and that the activities of the Democratic League organization in universities are adding contradictions to the school. He also said that the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties can reduce their activities in the future, and it is not appropriate to emphasize party relations or the role of grassroots organizations. He believes that in institutions, schools, and enterprises, all staff are colleagues. This will reduce contradictions in the institution, and the wall between the Party and the masses will collapse on its own. I believe that this view is also wrong and one-sided. Advocating that the CCP Party committee withdraw from universities is to abolish the leadership of the Party, which is in conflict with the charters of the democratic parties, the charter of the CPPCC, and the Constitution. As for saying that the Democratic League organization does not play a role in universities and adds contradictions to the school, it depends on what kind of activities the Democratic League organization is conducting. If it is obsessed with competing with the Communist Party for leadership, then, of course, it will increase some unnecessary contradictions. If not, then the democratic parties can play a good role. To resolve the contradictions in the relationship between the Party and the masses, the key lies in how the Party works, not in the existence of the Party organization. He believes that all parties can develop members in institutions and schools, but they should not establish grassroots organizations. This kind of statement is difficult to understand. How can a party lead and educate its members without its grassroots organizations? It is difficult to find such a party in world history. Advocating that grassroots organizations of parties should not be established in institutions and schools is actually advocating the abolition of parties.

### 吴晗谈话批驳章伯钧罗隆基

　　吴晗谈话批驳章伯钧罗隆基
　　章伯钧主张另搞一个政治设计院，是否不同意宪法？
　　罗隆基提出另外建立平反机构，就是不信任党的领导
　　储安平“党天下”的论调是恶毒的诬蔑
　　叶笃义的意见实际上就是党派取消论
    本报讯  中国民主同盟、北京市委员会主任委员吴晗在9日晚上民主同盟中国人民大学支部座谈会上，谈到他不同意章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平、叶笃义等人的意见。昨天，吴晗接见记者，谈到他对章伯钧、罗隆基等人的意见的看法。
    吴晗说，章伯钧说现在工业方面有许多设计院、政治方面就没有。他要求由政协、人大、民主党派和人民团体组成政治上的设计院。这话是很难理解的。宪法序言中讲到我国的统一战线由共产党领导。政协章程也说要进一步加强党的领导和核心作用。各民主党派也都承认共产党对各民主党派的领导作用。所谓领导，应该是政治上、思想上重大问题的领导。如果离开这种领导，另搞一个政治设计院，这是什么意思呢？是不是不同意宪法精神和政协章程，不满意共产党的领导呢？吴晗说：现在国家的重大措施，都是经过各民主党派讨论的。人大、政协每年开会，人大常委会每月开会，章伯钧参加了这些会议，他应该了解讨论的情况。现在他要搞一个什么政治设计院，这是不是表示他认为这些组织没有发生作用？是不是对共产党的核心作用有不同的看法？这也是使人很难理解的。所以我不同意他的意见。章伯钧还说国务院开会，常是拿出成品，要大家表示意见。他认为这样的会是形式主义的。国务院开会的实际情况如何，卢郁文已经在发言里介绍过了，我不再多说。但开会确实有两种不同的方法。一种是事先准备，征求意见，然后拿出一套比较成熟方案由大家讨论。另一种是英美议会式的。往往抓住一个问题长期辩论，了无结果。当然，英美议会的讨论也不是都没有准备，至于内阁的讨论更不能说是没有准备。总之，章伯钧这样提出问题，是不是对社会主义的政治方式不感兴趣、有所怀疑呢？所以我是不能同意他这个意见的。
    吴晗说，罗隆基在发言中主张要由全国人民代表大会和政治协商委员会成立一个委员会，这个委员会不但要检查“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”中的偏差，还要公开声明，鼓励大家申诉委屈。这个“平反”机构一定要同“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”的领导机构分开，因为这几个运动过去是共产党领导的。“平反”时除领导党外，还应由各民主党派和无党派人士参加。吴晗说：这个意见牵涉到两个问题：一个是他对党领导的“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”等机构是不信任的。一个是他把全国人民代表大会这样一个最高权力的立法机关，全国政治协商委员会这样一个协商机关，下降或者改变为司法行政机关，这和这两个机关的性质是不符合的。罗隆基还谈过民主党派发展组织的问题。他说共产党过去的发展对象主要是工农，民主党派主要是在旧知识分子（事实上是知识分子）当中发展，现在共产党也要发展知识分子党员，民主党派就没事干了。吴晗说，照罗隆基的说法，知识分子都要参加民主党派，不要参加共产党，这是不符合中国目前进步知识分子的现状和要求的。民主党派多年的工作，原来规定的目的本来在于协助共产党团结和教育知识分子。现在一部分知识分子的政治觉悟提高了，有不少人参加了共产党。这应当使我们感到高兴。所以我的看法和罗隆基是不一致的。罗隆基还说现在参加各民主党派的都是三、四十岁以上的人，民主党派今后可能后继无人，这和民主党派长期存在的要求发生了矛盾。这种说法也是不符合事实的。知识分子的年龄一般地要大一些，因为知识是不断积累起来的，年纪太小的人不可能具有一定的知识水平。民主党派不发展青年，只发展三、四十岁以上的人，是不是就不能长期存在了呢？我认为民主党派能否长期存在，关键在于政治立场，并不在于发展对象的年龄。青年要发展到中年，还要发展到老年，从这一点来看，民主党派的发展前途不可能、也不应该和共产党的发展发生矛盾。
    吴晗说：储安平作了一个很引人注意的发言，这个发言的目的是离开党的领导，反对社会主义方向。他提出了“党天下”的名词。在国民党统治时代生活过的人，都知道那时候的“党天下”就是“蒋家天下陈家党”，这怎么能和今天的人民的天下同日而语呢？这是一种恶毒的诬蔑。现在全国人大、政协、各级人大、政协，不是有很多民主党派成员，包括民盟盟员参加吗？在中央各部任部长、省、市任副省长、副市长的，不是有很多盟员么？这怎能说是“党天下”呢？储安平说
  “‘党天下’的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源”，是极其反动的话。他把一切现象归罪于宗派主义。宗派主义是要消灭的，他这话的含义岂不是要消灭宗派主义，就得消灭共产党，从而实际上取消了共产党的领导么？谁都知道，全国人民代表大会是最高权力机关。总理是全国人民代表大会选举的，我们都选举过，储安平也选举过。你现在这样说，不怕人民质问：“你是怎样当代表的呀？”有人钦佩储安平的“勇气”。我不禁要问：勇气是要来对付敌人，还是对付人民的呢？是要维护社会主义，还是破坏社会主义的呢？这个问题首先应当区别清楚。
    吴晗说，叶笃义在发言中说，高等学校的党委制应该改变，民盟组织在大学中的活动是给学校添矛盾。他又说各民主党派的基层组织，今后可以减少活动，不宜强调党派关系，不宜强调发挥基层组织作用。他认为在机关、学校、企业中，全体工作人员都是同事关系。这样就会减少机关中的矛盾，党群关系之间的墙不拆自拆。我认为，这种看法也是错误的和片面的。主张中共党委退出高等学校就是取消党的领导，这同各民主党派的章程、政协的章程和宪法都是抵触的。至于说民盟组织在大学里不起作用，给学校添矛盾，这要看民盟组织究竟是在进行什么活动。如果醉心于同共产党争领导权，那么，当然会增加一些不应有的矛盾。如果不是这样，那么，民主党派是可以起良好作用的。要解决党群关系中的矛盾，关键在于党如何工作，而不在于党组织的存在。他认为各党派在机关、学校里可以发展成员，但是不要建立基层组织。这种话很难使人理解，一个党派没有它的基层组织，怎样来领导、教育它的成员呢？在世界历史上很难找到这样的党派。主张机关、学校里不要建立党派的基层组织，实际上就是党派取消论。
