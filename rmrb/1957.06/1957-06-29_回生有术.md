　　The Art of Resuscitation
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th (By our reporter Li Nan) Beside the Red Square in Moscow, on a bustling commercial street, is the Resuscitation Laboratory of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. This laboratory is located above a building housing shops below, occupying only a few small rooms. However, its mission is to study a very important issue: how to snatch back life when breathing has stopped and the heart no longer beats. This laboratory has been working for twenty years.
    I visited this laboratory. The head of the laboratory is Professor Negovsky, who demonstrated the process of death and resuscitation. A dog played the main role in this demonstration. Death was artificially induced by bleeding. Blood flowed continuously from the arteries, and the dog gradually became immobile, its eyes becoming completely cloudy. As the blood was about to run out, the indicators showed that the heart had completely stopped beating; there was no breathing, and the body was cold. Professor Negovsky said that this is called clinical death. At this time, there is still a small amount of metabolism in the body. Only after a few minutes, when changes occur in the brain and this small amount of metabolism is completely lost, can life be considered irretrievably dead.
    Three minutes, five minutes, eight minutes after the heart stopped beating... the professor instructed to begin resuscitation work. All the instruments on both sides were turned on. These instruments helped the "dead" dog to breathe and have heart activity again, and blood was re-infused into the arteries. An hour later, the dog had obviously recovered its life.
    This experiment proves that the tissues of the body can be restored. Methods for restoring the life of the body are no longer confined to the laboratory, but are also being used in many hospitals. Many people on the verge of death have been revived, and hearts that have lost their function have begun to beat again. In the last five years alone, Professor Negovsky and his colleagues have revived more than a hundred people, who are now living well and able to work. This method was first used on the front lines in 1943, when a wounded soldier who had lost too much blood and whose heart had stopped beating was revived from a state of clinical death using this method.
    The main task of restoring the life of the body is to be able to extend the time of clinical death. If clinical death, after breathing ends and the heart stops beating, can be extended beyond four or five minutes, then resuscitation becomes easier. The most difficult part of the work is the central nervous system, which dies very quickly. Studying the patterns of the central nervous system at the onset of death is a major task of the laboratory.
    Negovsky's laboratory and Soviet medical scientists are already trying different ways to extend the time of clinical death. One method is to lower body temperature. Experiments have shown that if the body tissues are in a low-temperature state, the time of clinical death will be extended. In experiments with dogs, if the body temperature is lowered to 23 degrees Celsius, they can still be revived within one hour after blood circulation stops and the heart no longer beats.
    Instruments that replace the work of the heart and lungs are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This laboratory has designed five types of instruments. Soviet scholars have designed artificial hearts and artificial lungs. Scholars all over the world are studying the mysteries of death and the process of death, and the future achievements in this area are limitless. However, apart from the Soviet Union, there are no other places with a dedicated laboratory like Negovsky's.

　　回生有术
    新华社莫斯科28日电　本社记者李楠报道，在莫斯科红场旁边的一条热闹的商业街上，有苏联医学科学院的一个机体复苏实验室。这个实验室设在一座下面是商店的楼房上面，仅占了几间小屋子，但是它的任务却是在研究一个十分重大的问题，如何在呼吸已经停止，心脏不再跳动的时候，把生命夺取回来。这个实验室已经工作了二十年。
    记者曾经访问过这个实验室。这个实验室的负责人是列戈夫斯基教授，他给我们表演了一次生命死亡了，又如何复苏的过程。一只狗充当了这次表演的主角。死亡是用人工使血液流尽的方法造成的。血液从动脉中不断流出来，狗逐渐不能动弹了，眼睛也完全变得混浊了。当血液快要流完的时候，旁边的指示仪器表示出心脏完全停止跳动；呼吸也没有了，躯体也冰冷了。列戈夫斯基教授说，这叫做临床死亡，这时机体内还有少量的新陈代谢，只有经过几分钟以后，大脑发生变化，这点少量的新陈代谢全部丧失，生命才算是无可挽回地死亡了。
    心脏停止跳动后三分钟，五分钟，八分钟……这位教授指示开始进行复苏工作。两旁的仪器全部开动起来，这些仪器帮助“死”去了的狗又有了呼吸和心脏活动，而血液又重新输入动脉管里去。一小时后，狗显然已经恢复生命了。
    这次实验证明机体组织是可以恢复的。恢复机体生命的方法已经不仅停留在实验室里，而且在许多医院里也已经采用。不少濒于死亡的人恢复了生命，已经丧失了机能的心脏又重行跳动。仅在最近五年内，列戈夫斯基教授和他的同事们就复活了一百多人，他们现在都活得很好，并且能够工作。1943年第一次在前线开始应用这个方法，当时一个伤员因失血过多，心脏停止跳动，处在临床死亡状态，用这个方法使他活了转来。
    恢复机体生命的工作主要是要能够延长临床死亡的时间。如果呼吸结束，心脏停止跳动后的临床死亡不止是四、五分钟，而能延续到更长的时间，生命复苏就比较容易。工作中最困难的一环是中央神经系统，它的死亡极快。研究中央神经系统在死亡发生时的规律是实验室的一项主要的任务。
    列戈夫斯基的实验室和苏联的医学家们已经在试用不同的办法来延长临床死亡的时间。一种方法就是降低体温。实验证明，如果机体组织处在低温状态，那么临床死亡的时间就会延长。实验时的狗，如果体温降低到摄氏二十三度，它在血液循环停止、心脏不跳后一个小时内还可以复活。
    代替心脏和肺工作的仪器越来越完善。这个实验室已经设计出五种类型的仪器。苏联学者已经设计出了人造心脏和人造肺。全世界都有学者在研究死亡的奥秘和死亡发生的过程，这方面未来的成就是不可限量的。不过像列戈夫斯基这样的一个专门的实验室，除苏联外，其他地方还没有。
