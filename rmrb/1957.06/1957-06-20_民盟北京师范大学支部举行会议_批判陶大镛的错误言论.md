The China Democratic League Branch of Beijing Normal University Holds Meeting
To Criticize Tao Dayong's Erroneous Remarks

    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) The Beijing Normal University branch of the China Democratic League held an enlarged meeting of the branch committee on the afternoon of the 18th. While exposing and criticizing Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and Chu Anping, they also exposed and criticized Tao Dayong, the vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, for his activities and remarks against the leadership of the Party, and resolutely drew a clear ideological line with them. Wu Yuheng, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and others attended the meeting.

    Lu Zongda exposed Tao Dayong's suspicious activities during the discussion of the higher education system.

    Professor Lu Zongda, after exposing Luo Longji's past words and deeds, pointed out that his reactionary remarks were not accidental. He then went on to expose Tao Dayong's suspicious activities in the discussion of the higher education system. He said: The discussion at the Beijing Normal University on democratic school management, which essentially meant the abolition of Party leadership, was orchestrated single-handedly by Tao Dayong. Tao Dayong violated organizational principles, did not go through the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League or the China Democratic League branch of Beijing Normal University, but first found several professors outside the league to discuss the issue. Only after having a complete set of outlines did he find the China Democratic League branch of Beijing Normal University to hold another meeting in the name of the branch for discussion. As the chairman of the branch, I was asked to chair the forum, but I didn't know who would participate in the forum or what the content would be. The forum was completely controlled by Tao Dayong. At the beginning of the meeting, he introduced the content of the previous meeting, saying, "This is a relatively consistent opinion and serves as the basis for this discussion." Professor Lu Zongda also pointed out: The most noteworthy thing is that before the Guangming Daily published the full record of the forum, Tao Dayong suddenly removed his and another gentleman's speeches. The Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League felt this was inappropriate, and he only sent the revised speech for publication. This approach makes people suspect whether he is playing a double game? On the one hand, he is manipulating behind the scenes, opposing the leadership of the Party in the name of democratic school management; on the other hand, he is changing his own remarks. Is this Tao Dayong's personal problem or do some people in the Central Committee of the League have other intentions? Professor Lu Zongda sternly pointed out: This issue is a struggle between accepting the leadership of the Party and opposing the leadership of the Party. We must thoroughly clarify it. The China Democratic League branch of Beijing Normal University believes that Tao Dayong needs to explain.

    Wang Maichu said that Tao Dayong's advocated "democratic school management" essentially meant the abolition of Party leadership.

    Wang Maichu, deputy director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The democratic school management advocated by Tao Dayong and others essentially meant the abolition of Party leadership. Their conclusion from the discussion was to establish three institutions: First, the Academic Committee, which would be responsible for internal affairs by those who teach. The Academic Committee would control teaching power, human rights, and financial power, and would be the highest authority in the school. They also proposed the highest program and the lowest program. The highest program is ideal, that is, the president and department heads are democratically elected. The lowest program starts from reality, and the president is appointed by the State Council. Second, the Party Committee is an amateur, but it has the power to make decisions, which is created by the system. It is best not to have these "amateurs" manage the business, but only manage organizational life, political and ideological leadership, and play a model role among the masses. Third, the School Affairs Committee is only responsible for administrative affairs, work, and welfare. Wang Maichu said: In this way, they actually want to put the Academic Committee above the Party Committee, holding the power of teaching, scientific research, personnel transfer, financial planning, etc., and the school Party Committee has no right to intervene. The Party Committee's authority is only political and ideological leadership, and this kind of leadership is hollow. Their advocated democratic school management is actually professor-run school, but they are afraid of stimulating the Party, so they call it democratic school management.

    Tai Shuangqiu pointed out that Tao Dayong's so-called need to strengthen the leadership role of the Party through a better form is completely sophistry.

    Professor Tai Shuangqiu said: Tao Dayong advocated that professors have the right to decide on school-related teaching and scientific research work. Regarding financial work, mainly budgets and final accounts, members of the administrative meeting should also report to the Academic Committee. In this way, the leadership of the Party Committee is deprived. But he also euphemistically said: "This is by no means to withdraw the Party Committee from the school or weaken the leadership of the Party, but to strengthen the leadership role of the Party through a better form." This is completely sophistry. This meeting was held twice in total, and the second meeting was a continuation of the first. Tao Dayong said that everyone's opinions at the first meeting were close. This is not in accordance with the facts. At that time, I was one of the people who had different views. Twelve people spoke at the second meeting, and the content of the speeches was published in the Guangming Daily on June 4. Please see how many people's opinions are close to what Tao Dayong said? Who exactly does Tao Dayong's "everyone" refer to? Why did Tao Dayong only propose some methods to weaken the leadership of the Party at the second meeting, and add many of his own opinions, but not mention the opposing opinions? Professor Tai Shuangqiu suggested that the China Democratic League branch of Beijing Normal University quickly convene a meeting of League members to launch criticism against Luo Longji, Tao Dayong, and others, and express their attitude.

    Liao Taichu exposed Tao Dayong's misappropriation of the name of the China Democratic League branch, saying that "democratic school management" was the unanimous opinion of the China Democratic League branch.

    Professor Liao Taichu said: I participated in the second meeting convened by Tao Dayong to discuss the school system issue. No matter what rhetoric he used, I always felt that this smell was against the leadership of the Party, which I absolutely could not agree with. Tao Dayong explained at a branch committee meeting held later: "That meeting was already held late, and it must be completed quickly." Why was Tao Dayong eager to come up with a material about advocating democratic school management when the evil wind was at its peak? What does this mean? (Tai Shuangqiu and others interjected and said: They are preparing to make a plan to be discussed among League members of the China Democratic League in universities across the country.) Comrade Lu Leshan and I are both studying education, and we are also members of the China Democratic League branch of Beijing Normal University. Why didn't we participate in the first meeting? Although I was invited to participate in the second meeting, I felt that we branch committee members were being used. Therefore, at the end of the meeting, we stated that some of the opinions at the meeting could not represent the opinions of the China Democratic League branch and needed to be further studied. However, Tao Dayong later misappropriated the name of the China Democratic League branch and said that advocating democratic school management was the unanimous opinion of the China Democratic League branch.

    Wang Rubili pointed out that Tao Dayong fits the characteristics of right-wing elements' activities very well.

    Professor Wang Rubili said: I would like to provide some clues about Tao Dayong for everyone's reference. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Tao Dayong said that the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University must collapse in this rectification. When he gave opinions to the Party, he exaggerated shortcomings, obliterated achievements, and denied the leadership of the Party. I disagreed with his opinion, and he taught me a lesson, saying that I was not aware of the overall situation. Later, he wooed backward elements to attack the Party, and used democratic school management as a guise to negate the leadership of the Party. These things all show that Tao Dayong fits the characteristics of right-wing elements' activities very well.

    Bai Shouyi, Yang Minru, Feng Zhongtai, Chen Qiufan, Zhao Qinghuan, Liu Zhen and others all spoke, believing that their thinking was paralyzed and not clear enough, so that they could not detect and expose the activities of some right-wing elements in time, and were even used by right-wing elements. Everyone unanimously demanded a self-examination of thought.

    Wu Yuheng pointed out that Tao Dayong's "democratic school management" essentially meant taking the Anglo-American capitalist road.

    Wu Yuheng, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, spoke at the meeting. He first said: Our Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League does not have enough political vigilance and should deeply reflect on it. It has been more than 20 days since Comrade Tao Dayong published his proposal for "democratic school management" and opposition to the Party committee system in the newspaper, and the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League has not investigated it in time, which shows that the political vigilance of the负责人 of our Municipal Committee is too poor. He said: Comrade Tao Dayong, as the deputy director of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, is not the person in charge of the grassroots organization of Beijing Normal University, but he carried out activities in Beijing Normal University and arbitrarily published remarks and proposals against the Party committee system without going through the grassroots person in charge. This is obviously disregarding the organization and should be criticized. Our Municipal Committee has repeatedly emphasized collective leadership, and opinions and proposals on major issues must first be collectively discussed in the Municipal Committee, but Comrade Tao Dayong violated this principle and disregarded the Municipal Committee organization, which is intolerable. He said: Regarding some shortcomings in the work of the person in charge of the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University, we also pointed out each item when we inspected the school a few months ago, and submitted a written report to the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee for inspection and handling. However, when Comrade Tao Dayong helped the Party in the rectification campaign, he did not proceed from the desire for unity to help the Party correct its shortcomings, but attempted to undermine the Party's prestige among the vast number of intellectuals. He said that the Party Committee is "amateur" and "ignorant," and that the so-called "Academic Research Committee" is the highest authority in Beijing Normal University, so that the Party Committee has no right to interfere in teaching matters within the school, euphemistically calling it "democratic school management," which is essentially to abolish the leadership of the Party, to take the Anglo-American capitalist road, and to oppose taking the socialist road. The road taken by Comrade Tao Dayong is consistent with the road of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. On behalf of the Municipal Committee, I accept the opinions of the comrades. The Municipal Committee should conduct a thorough examination, and Comrade Tao Dayong must clearly explain his relationship with Luo Longji and others, otherwise we will never give up!

### 民盟北京师范大学支部举行会议  批判陶大镛的错误言论

　　民盟北京师范大学支部举行会议
　　批判陶大镛的错误言论
    本报讯　中国民主同盟北京师范大学支部18日下午举行支委扩大会议，在揭发和批判罗隆基、章伯钧、储安平的同时，还揭发和批判了民盟北京市委副主任委员陶大镛反对党的领导的活动和言论，并坚决和他们划清思想界限。民盟北京市委副主任委员吴昱恒等出席了这次会议。
    陆宗达揭发陶大镛在讨论高等学校体制问题时的可疑活动。
    陆宗达教授在揭发了罗隆基过去的言行，指出他发表反动言论不是偶然的以后，接着揭发了陶大镛在讨论高等学校体制问题中令人怀疑的活动。他说：在师大提出民主办校，实质上是取消党的领导的讨论，是陶大镛一手包办进行的。陶大镛破坏了组织原则，不通过民盟市委和师大民盟支部，自己先找了几位盟外的教授讨论这个问题，俟有了一套完整的纲领，才找师大民盟支部以支部名义再开会讨论。我作为支部主委，要我主持座谈会，但我却不知道参加这次座谈会的有哪些人，座谈的内容是什么？座谈会完全被陶大镛所把持。他在会上一开始就介绍了上次会的内容，说“这是比较一致的意见，作为这次讨论的基础”。陆宗达教授还指出：最值得注意的是光明日报发表座谈会全部记录以前，陶大镛突然把他和另一位先生的发言抽走了，民盟市委觉得不妥当，他才把经过修改后的发言稿送去刊登。这种做法很使人怀疑他是不是在耍两面派？一方面在幕后操纵，借民主办校的名义反对党的领导；一方面又在改变自己的言论。这是陶大镛个人的问题还是盟中央某些人另有企图？陆宗达教授严正地指出：这个问题是接受党的领导和反对党的领导的斗争，我们要把它彻底搞清楚，师大民盟支部认为陶大镛有交代的必要。
    王麦初说，陶大镛主张的“民主办校”，实质上是取消党的领导
    民盟北京市委文教委员会副主任王麦初说：陶大镛等所主张的民主办校，实质上是取消党的领导。他们讨论的结论是成立三个机构：一、学术委员会，由教书的人管内行的事，学术委员会掌握教权、人权和财权，它是学校的最高权力机关。他们还提出了最高纲领和最低纲领。最高纲领是理想的，即校长与系主任由民主选举。最低纲领是从实际出发，校长由国务院任命。二、党委会是外行，但又有决定权，这是制度造成的。最好不要他们这些“外行”管业务，而只管组织生活、政治思想领导，在群众中起模范作用。三、校务委员会，只专管行政事务工作和生活福利等。王麦初说：这样，实际上是想把学术委员会驾凌于党委会之上，握有教学、科学研究、人事调动、财务计划等大权，学校党委无权过问。党委的职权只是政治思想领导，而这种领导是驾空的。他们主张的民主办校实际上是教授治校，只是怕刺激党，所以才名之为民主办校。
    邰爽秋指出，陶大镛所谓要通过一个更好的形式来加强党的领导作用，完全是狡辩。
    邰爽秋教授说：陶大镛主张教授有权决定学校的有关教学和科学研究工作。关于财务工作主要是预算和决算，也要由行政会议的成员向学术委员会报告。这样，党委的领导权就被剥夺了。可是他还美其名说：“这绝不是要党委退出学校或削弱党的领导，而是要通过一个更好的形式来加强党的领导作用。”这完全是狡辩。这个会一共开过两次，第二次会是第一次会的继续。陶大镛说第一次会上大家意见接近。这不符合事实，当时我就是有不同看法的一个人。在第二次会上发言的有十二个人，发言内容登载在6月4日光明日报上，请看有几个人的意见和陶大镛所说的意见接近？陶大镛所说的“大家”到底是指的谁？陶大镛为何在第二次会上只提出一些削弱党的领导的办法，并且加上自己的许多意见，却不把反对的意见说出来？邰爽秋教授建议师大民盟支部赶紧召开盟员大会，对罗隆基、陶大镛等展开批判，表明态度。
    廖泰初揭露陶大镛盗用民盟支部的名义说“民主办校”是民盟支部一致的意见
    廖泰初教授说：我曾参加陶大镛所召集的第二次讨论学校体制问题的会，不管他用什么花言巧语，我总觉得这气味是反对党的领导，是我所绝对不能同意的。陶大镛在以后召开的一次支委会上解释说：“那个会已经开晚了，必须快些完成。”陶大镛为什么在歪风最盛的时候急于弄出一个关于主张民主办校的材料来呢？这是什么意思？（邰爽秋等插言说：他们准备弄一个方案交全国各大学民盟盟员中进行讨论）我和卢乐山同志都是学教育的，又同时是师大民盟支部支委，为何第一次会不吸收我们参加？第二次会虽然请我参加了，但我觉得我们这几个支委是被利用了。因此我们在会议结束时表示会上的一些意见不能代表民盟支部的意见，还有待研究。可是陶大镛后来却又盗用民盟支部的名义，说主张民主办校是民盟支部的一致意见。
    王汝弼指出陶大镛很符合右派分子活动的特征
    王汝弼教授说：我愿提供陶大镛的一些蛛丝马迹，供大家参考。整风开始时，陶大镛就说在这次整风中师大党委一定要垮。他在给党提意见时，一提就夸大缺点，抹杀成绩，否认党的领导。我不同意他的这种意见，他反而教训我一顿，说我不识大体。以后，他又拉拢落后分子，向党进攻，并以民主办校为幌子，否定党的领导。这些事都说明陶大镛很符合右派分子活动的特征。
    白寿彝、杨敏如、冯钟泰、陈秋帆、赵擎寰、刘珍等都发了言，认为自己思想麻痹、不够清醒，以致对一些右派分子的活动不能及时发觉、揭发，甚至被右派分子所利用。大家一致要求进行一次思想检查。
    吴昱恒指出，陶大镛的“民主办校”实质上是要走英美式的资本主义道路。
    民盟北京市委副主任吴昱恒在会上发了言。他首先说：我们民盟北京市委的政治警惕性是不够的，应该深刻检讨。陶大铸同志在报上发表“民主治校”、反对党委制的主张之后，已经二十多天了，民盟市委没有及时追究，这说明我们市委负责人的政治警惕性太差。他说：陶大镛同志身为民盟市委副主任，并不是师大基层组织负责人，却不通过基层负责人而在师大大肆活动，擅自发表反对党委制的言论和主张，这显然是目无组织，应该受到批判。我们市委会曾一再强调集体领导，对于重大问题发表言论和主张，必须先在市委会集体讨论，而陶大镛同志却违反这一原则，蔑视市委组织，这是不能容忍的。他说：关于师大党委负责人工作上存在一些缺点，我们于几个月前在该校视察时也曾逐款指出，有书面报告交中共市委统战部检查处理。但陶大镛同志在帮助党整风的时候，却不从团结的愿望出发，去帮助党改正缺点，而企图破坏党在广大知识分子中的威信。说党委如何“外行”，如何“无知”，把所谓“学术研究委员会”作为师大的最高权力机关，使党委无权过问校内教学事宜，美其名曰“民主办校”，实质上就是要取消党的领导，要走英美式的资本主义道路，反对走社会主义道路。陶大镛同志走的道路是和章伯钧、罗隆基的道路一致的。我代表市委会接受同志们的意见，市委会应作彻底检查，陶大镛同志和罗隆基等的关系必须交代清楚，否则我们决不罢休！
