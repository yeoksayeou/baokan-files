    Must Hand Over Murderer Girard
    Japanese Ministry of Justice Believes US Court Has No Right to Interfere
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japanese Ministry of Justice stated yesterday that the US court's order to temporarily refrain from handing over the US soldier Girard, who killed a Japanese woman, to Japan for trial has no binding force on Japan's judicial work and does not affect Japan's right to adjudicate.
    The Ministry of Justice said that the basis for Girard's American lawyer's application to the US court for habeas corpus seems to be that the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" violates the US Constitution. However, whether this agreement violates the US Constitution is irrelevant to the Japanese court. Japan can only try the US soldier Girard according to Article 17 of the "Administrative Agreement." Article 17 of the "Administrative Agreement" stipulates that Japanese authorities have the right to try American soldiers and their families who commit crimes within Japanese territory.
    On the 7th, the US military authorities openly held a press conference for the murderer Girard in the military camp. At the meeting, Girard tried his best to wash away his crimes and expressed "confidence" in his case.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Sakai Akiyoshi, the husband of Sakai Naka, the Japanese farmer killed by an American soldier, angrily told an Associated Press reporter today: "Some Americans insist that the murderer who killed my wife should be tried by the United States because these people think that the Japanese people are not human, simply like dogs."
    Sakai Akiyoshi also said, "I believe all Japanese people are as indignant as I am."

    必须交出杀人犯哲腊德
    日本法务省认为美国法院无权干涉
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本法务省昨天表示，美国法院规定暂时不把杀死日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德交给日本审讯的命令，对日本的审判工作并没有任何约束力量，并且也不影响日本的裁判权利。
    法务省说，哲腊德的美国律师向美国法院申请人身保护的根据，似乎在于美日“行政协定”违反了美国宪法，但是，这个协定是否违反美国宪法和日本法院不相干，日本只能根据“行政协定”第十七条审判美国兵哲腊德。“行政协定”第十七条规定，日本当局有权审判在日本领域内犯罪的美国军人及其家属。
    7日，美军当局公然在军营中为杀人犯哲腊德举行记者招待会。哲腊德在会上竭力洗刷他的罪行，并且表示对他的案子“有信心”。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：被美国兵杀害的日本农妇坂井中的丈夫坂井秋吉今天对美联社记者气愤地说：“有一些美国人坚持要由美国来审判杀害我的妻子的凶手，因为这些人认为日本人民说不上是人，简直像狗一样。”
    坂井秋吉还说，“我相信全日本人民都像我一样地愤慨。”
