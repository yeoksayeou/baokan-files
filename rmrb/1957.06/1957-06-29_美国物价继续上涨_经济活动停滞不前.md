　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: The United States government announced on the 25th that the U.S. cost of living index for May was 119.6 (with 1947-1949 levels as 100). This is the ninth consecutive month that the U.S. cost of living has risen, and there are currently no signs of a decline.

　　The U.S. government also announced that, due to rising prices, the actual purchasing power of U.S. workers' wages fell by 1.5% in April and May. According to U.S. press reports, in the past year, the actual wages of machinery manufacturing workers have decreased by 2.6%, furniture workers by 3.7%, and tobacco workers by 4.8%.

　　Rising prices also threaten farmers' incomes. The U.S. government estimates that U.S. farmers' cash income will increase by about 4% this year compared to last year, but the cost of living for farmers has already risen by 3% by May of this year compared to last year.

　　Concurrent with inflation, U.S. economic activity is stagnant. According to the U.S. government, the U.S. industrial production index was 147 in December of last year (the average for 1947-1949 was 100), but in January, February, and March of this year, the index dropped to 146, and then to 145 in April. According to the "New York Times," in May, indicators of business activity, including transportation and industry, continued to decline.

　　United Press reporter Mooreka said on the 27th that the sluggishness of U.S. economic activity is mainly due to the decrease in sales of automobiles and furniture, as well as the decline in housing construction, agricultural machinery, and steel production. For example, the current operating rate of the steel industry is only 85.2%, and it is estimated that it will fall to 70% by July. Automobile production is estimated to be 5.8 million vehicles for the entire year, whereas at the beginning of the year it was estimated to reach 6 million to 6.2 million vehicles. Currently, many factories are shortening working hours and laying off large numbers of workers.

　　美国物价继续上涨  经济活动停滞不前
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府25日宣布，5月份的美国生活费用指数是一百一十九·六（以1947—1949年的水平为一百），这已经是美国生活费用连续第九个月上涨了，而且目前还看不到有下降的迹象。
    美国政府同时还宣布，由于物价上涨，在4月份和5月份，美国工人工资的实际购买力已经下降了1.5％。而据美国报刊报道，在过去一年里，机器制造业工人的实际工资已经减少了2.6％，家俱工人的实际工资减少了3.7％，烟草工人的实际工资减少了4.8％。
    物价上涨也威胁着农民的收入。美国政府估计，在今年，美国农民的现金收入将比去年增加约4％，但是仅仅到今年5月，农民的生活费用就已经比去年上涨了3％。
    在通货膨胀的同时，美国的经济活动呈现停滞不前的状态。据美国政府宣布，在去年12月，美国的工业生产指数是一百四十七（1947—1949年的平均数为一百），但是在今年1、2、3月，这个指数却下降为一百四十六，到4月份再下降为一百四十五。据“纽约时报”报道，在5月份，包括运输业和工业在内的企业活动指标继续在减少。
    合众社记者摩尔卡27日说，美国经济活动所以不振，主要是由于汽车和家俱的销售的减少以及住房建筑、农业机器和钢铁生产的下降。例如钢铁工业目前的开工率只有85.2％，估计到7月份还要下降到70％。汽车的生产估计今年全年是五百八十万辆，而今年年初时曾估计可以达到六百万到六百二十万辆。目前许多工厂已经纷纷在缩短工作时间，解雇大批工人。
