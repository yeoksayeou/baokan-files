London Observer Predicts:
Commonwealth Conference May Not Be Optimistic

    London dispatch, June 24th. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be held at 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's official residence, on June 26th, and is scheduled to last for ten days.

    According to recent newspaper reports, this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will discuss many issues, including important issues such as East-West relations, disarmament and Anglo-European relations, the Middle East issue, British investment in Commonwealth countries, trade payments between Commonwealth countries, and the issue of a "free trade zone." Britain hopes that this conference will help strengthen its relationship with Commonwealth countries, enable Commonwealth countries to support British foreign policy, and thus stabilize and strengthen Britain's international position.

    However, observers here are not optimistic about this conference. London newspapers point out in their reports that there are differences of opinion between Britain and Commonwealth countries, and among Commonwealth countries themselves, on many major issues.

    People remember that at the last Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which was called the "most important" of the post-war era, Britain put forward the slogan of a "third force" and expressed its desire to improve East-West relations and ease international tensions. These proposals were widely supported by the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth countries. However, shortly after the conference, the Suez Crisis occurred, and Britain engaged in military adventures, which not only disrupted Britain's plans but also caused serious rifts within the Commonwealth.

    After the Suez Crisis, Britain decided to reduce its conventional forces and announced the relaxation of trade restrictions on China. These were decisions aimed at strengthening Britain's position; however, Britain did not fundamentally abandon the "embargo" policy, and it was still largely subject to the United States. On the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the issue of China's territory of Taiwan, Britain has so far adopted an ambiguous attitude. Therefore, some people estimate that the issue of relations with China, which has been discussed many times among Commonwealth Prime Ministers, will again cause a dispute at this conference.

    Britain has also not been active enough in improving Anglo-Soviet relations; Macmillan's recent reply to Bulganin was considered by even the British bourgeois press to lack "initiative." This attitude prevents Britain from playing its due role in improving East-West relations and is also dissatisfactory to some Commonwealth countries.

    In terms of disarmament, although Britain has decided to cut conventional forces, it is keen to pursue a "nuclear deterrent." This Commonwealth Conference is being held after Britain has consecutively tested three hydrogen bombs. Britain wants to use this demonstrative test to enhance its speaking position in the international arena, but this does not seem to be beneficial to improving Britain's relations with Commonwealth countries. On the issue of testing hydrogen bombs, some Commonwealth countries do not agree with Britain's policy.

    The Middle East issue is a key issue to be discussed at this conference. Britain particularly hopes that Commonwealth countries will support its Middle East policy. At present, Britain has adopted a more realistic attitude on issues such as the use of the Suez Canal and improving relations with Egypt. At the same time, it is using various methods to consolidate its colonial position in the Middle East. In addition to continuing to use the Baghdad Pact, Britain recently launched a serious military provocation against Yemen. Some important Commonwealth countries, such as India, disagree with Britain's approach to this kind of colonialism.

    The discussion of economic issues will also receive special attention at this conference. If Britain wants to strengthen its ties with Commonwealth countries, an important step is whether it can expand investment in the Commonwealth. Economically underdeveloped Commonwealth countries urgently need a large amount of capital, but Britain is now unable to take care of itself economically and it is difficult to spare the extra strength to meet these needs. The "Financial Times" on the 21st replied that the Commonwealth Conference's discussion of investment issues "will not have any results. What we can tell the Commonwealth Prime Ministers is that we cannot do anything for them, rather than what we can do for them." On the other hand, Britain has proposed a free trade zone plan relative to the European Common Market, hoping to gain the support of Commonwealth countries. This issue involves the interests of imperial preference and other Commonwealth members, and there are many contradictions, making it difficult to reconcile. It is precisely because of this situation that some pessimistic observers are already predicting that this conference is unlikely to be successful.

### 伦敦观察家预测：英联邦会议未可乐观

　　伦敦观察家预测：
　　英联邦会议未可乐观
    本报伦敦24日电　英联邦总理会议将在6月26日在唐宁街十号英国首相官邸举行，会期预定十天。
    据近日报纸透露，这次联邦总理会议将要讨论的问题很多，其中重要的问题有东西方关系问题，裁军和英欧关系问题，中东问题，英国对联邦国家的投资以及英联邦国家的贸易支付问题，“自由贸易区”的问题等。英国希望这次会议能有助于加强英国同联邦国家的关系，使联邦国家支持英国的外交政策，从而稳定并加强英国的国际地位。
    但是，这里的观察家对这次会议的估计并不是乐观的。伦敦的报纸在报道中都指出：目前，英国同联邦国家之间，联邦国家相互之间，在许多重大的问题上都有着分歧的意见。
    人们记得，在上次被称为战后“最重要的”联邦总理会议中，英国提出了“第三种力量”的口号，并且表示了改善东西方关系和缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，这些主张得到了联邦各国总理的广泛支持。但会后不久，发生了苏伊士事件，英国进行了军事冒险，这不但打乱了英国的计划，还使联邦内部发生了严重的裂痕。
    在苏伊士事件以后，英国决定裁减常规军队，宣布放宽对中国的贸易限制，这是一些旨在加强英国地位的决定；然而英国并没有根本抛弃“禁运”政策，而且受制于美国的地方还多。在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利和关于中国领土台湾的问题上，英国迄今仍然采取暖昧的态度。因此，有人估计，对华关系这个在联邦总理之间已经多次讨论的问题，在这次会议上又将引起一场争论。
    英国对改善英苏关系也表现得不够积极；麦克米伦最近给布尔加宁的复信，连英国资产阶级报纸也认为是缺少“主动精神”的。这种态度使得英国在改善东西方关系的问题上不能发挥应有的作用，也为某些联邦国家所不满。
    在裁军方面，英国虽然决定削减常规部队，但是却热中于追求“核威慑力量”。这次联邦会议，就是在英国接连试验了三个氢弹之后举行的。英国是想靠这种示威性的试验提高它在国际上的发言地位，但是这对于改善英国同联邦国家的关系似乎并无裨益。就在试验氢弹这一问题上，有些联邦国家就不赞同英国的政策。
    中东问题是这次会议要着重讨论的问题。英国特别希望联邦国家支持它的中东政策。目前，英国对使用苏伊士运河问题和改进同埃及的关系等问题采取了比较现实的态度。同时它正在用各种方法巩固自己在中东的殖民地位。除了继续利用巴格达军事条约，英国最近对也门发动了严重的军事挑衅行动。对于这种殖民主义的活动，一些重要的联邦国家如印度就不同意英国的做法。
    对经济问题的讨论在这次会议上也将受到特别的重视。英国要想加强同联邦国家的联系。重要的一着是能否对联邦扩大投资。经济不发达的各联邦国家急需大量资金，而英国现在在经济上自顾不暇，很难抽出多余的力量来满足这些需要。21日的“金融时报”回答道，联邦会议对投资问题的讨论，“将不会有什么结果。我们所能告诉给联邦总理的，是我们不能够为他们作些什么，而不是能替他们作些什么。”另一方面，英国提出了和欧洲共同市场相对的自由贸易区计划，希望得到联邦国家的支持。这个问题牵涉到帝国优惠制和其他联邦成员国的巨大利益，矛盾很多，调和不易。正是由于这种情况，因此有些悲观的观察家甚至已经在预言这次会议难望有成就。
