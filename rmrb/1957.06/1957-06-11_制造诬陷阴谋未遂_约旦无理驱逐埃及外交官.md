Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th: Cairo newspapers reported today that the Jordanian government, after failing in an activity that attempted to implicate the Egyptian military attaché to Jordan, Lieutenant Colonel Hilal, in a so-called conspiracy against the Jordanian government and the King, has demanded the expulsion of Hilal and the Egyptian Consul General in Jerusalem.

On the evening of June 8th, a Jordanian secret agent visited Hilal. He tried to persuade Hilal to participate in a conspiracy against the Jordanian government and King Hussein. Hilal, having seen through the secret agent's plot, detained him. A recorder and a revolver were found on the secret agent. The secret agent wrote a confession stating that he was ordered by the Jordanian Army Chief of Staff, Majali, to frame Hilal.

The Egyptian Embassy in Jordan immediately informed the Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai of this matter. According to an agreement between Rifai and the Egyptian Chargé d'affaires, the secret agent has been handed over to the Jordanian authorities. The Egyptian Embassy also gave the Jordanian authorities a copy of the secret agent's confession.

Despite all this done by the Egyptian side, Rifai still summoned the Egyptian Embassy Chargé d'affaires on the afternoon of June 9th, telling him that the Jordanian King demanded that the Egyptian military attaché and the Egyptian Consul General in Jerusalem leave Jordanian territory this morning.

This incident is taking place while the Saudi Arabian King Saud is paying an official visit to Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 10th: King Saud of Saudi Arabia today inspected a secret exercise of the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian armies in a certain place in Jordan.

Saudi Arabian troops were stationed in Jordan last year during the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt.

　　制造诬陷阴谋未遂
　　约旦无理驱逐埃及外交官
    新华社开罗10日电  开罗报纸今天报道，约旦政府在制造了一个企图把埃及驻约旦大使馆武官希拉尔中校牵连在所谓反对约旦政府和国王的阴谋中的活动失败以后，已经要求把希拉尔和埃及驻耶路撒冷总领事驱逐出境。
    6月8日晚上，一名约旦特务拜访了希拉尔。他劝希拉尔参加反对约旦政府和国王侯赛因的阴谋。希拉尔识破这个特务的阴谋以后就把他扣留了起来。在这个特务身上搜出了一个录音器和一支左轮手枪。这个特务写下供词说，他是奉约旦陆军参谋长马加利的命令来陷害希拉尔的。
    埃及驻约旦大使馆立即把这件事情通知约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊。根据里法伊和埃及代办的一项协议，这个特务已经移交给约旦当局。埃及大使馆还把这个特务供词的一份抄件交给了约旦当局。
    尽管埃及方面做了所有这一切，里法伊仍然在6月9日下午召见了埃及大使馆代办，告诉他约旦国王要求埃及武官和埃及驻耶路撒冷总领事在今天早上离开约旦的领土。
    这个事件正发生在沙特阿拉伯国王沙特在约旦进行正式访问的时候。
    据新华社10日讯  安曼消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特今天在约旦某地参观了沙特阿拉伯和约旦两国陆军的秘密演习。
    沙特阿拉伯军队是去年英、法和以色列侵略埃及的时候进驻约旦的。
