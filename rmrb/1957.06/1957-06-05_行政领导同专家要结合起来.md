Administrative Leaders Must Combine with Experts
Jin Baoshan, Director of the Department of Hygiene, Beijing Medical College

Since the founding of New China, the achievements in people's health have been enormous and unprecedented in the past few years. However, due to significant shortcomings and errors in the implementation of policies by the health administration departments, certain losses have been brought to the health cause.

In the early days of the People's Republic of China, the main shortcomings of the health department were subjectivism and sectarianism. This was manifested in the following aspects. In the policy towards traditional Chinese medicine, the scientific elements in the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and the role played by the vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in our country's health cause were not recognized. It was believed that traditional Chinese medicine was unscientific and should be eliminated quickly. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine was underestimated and discriminated against, and the correct policy of unity between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine was not implemented. In health and epidemic prevention work, great efforts were made to prevent the three major highly infectious diseases of plague, smallpox, and cholera, but parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria, which are extremely harmful to people's health, were not given enough attention early on. In terms of medical treatment and prevention, the number of medical beds and sanatorium beds was rapidly increased, and the public medical care system was announced; this was a good aspect. However, the socialist healthcare principles of the Soviet Union were not adopted, and the traditional methods of only treating diseases without preventing them were simply developed in medical institutions. The advanced working methods of combining medical treatment with prevention were not carried out. Furthermore, some of the good systems that originally existed in medical institutions were destroyed, and new working systems were not established, resulting in chaos in the medical system and medical style. In terms of industrial hygiene, the competent departments of light and heavy industries, railways, etc., all set up their own health administrative leading bodies, each acting on its own. The central Ministry of Health neither provided unified leadership nor gave effective assistance, resulting in overlapping medical institutions in various industrial departments and a lack of correct guidance in terms of occupational hygiene and worker healthcare. In terms of medical education, a specialized key system was created in an arbitrary manner, shortening the length of higher medical education to two or three years, disrupting the entire medical education system. In maternal and child health work, new methods of midwifery were promoted, greatly reducing neonatal tetanus and puerperal fever; this was a good aspect. However, the health department did not take the initiative to contact the relevant responsible authorities to guide improvements in the health conditions of nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools, so that children's healthcare has not yet been developed.

The main reason for the above situation is that a few leading comrades in the health administrative authorities, with insufficient political cultivation, inadequate scientific level, and lack of practical experience, have taken on arduous tasks that they are unable to handle. They have been unable to correctly grasp policies or obtain the strong assistance of experienced scientific workers, resulting in many shortcomings and errors in the implementation of their work. Since the criticism of Comrades He Cheng and Wang Bin, these situations have improved somewhat in recent years, and certain improvements have been made in the work; however, there are still many shortcomings in the current health administrative leading departments. Not only does sectarianism remain the same, but bureaucracy has also grown.

In order to correct past errors and shortcomings, the health department has recently been actively strengthening political and ideological leadership, which is very important. However, in the various professional departments of socialist construction, business problems cannot be completely solved by relying solely on pure political and ideological leadership, but political ideology must be implemented in specific business. Political leadership and business leadership must be integrated into one. An important condition for doing a good job of such leadership is that the leading comrades must have sufficient political cultivation, scientific level, and practical experience; or that leading comrades with a high degree of political cultivation can obtain the specific assistance of experienced scientific experts in their daily work; the facts shown by the health department are not entirely like this.

The Ministry of Health established the National Medical Science Committee very early. Such an organization, in the Soviet Union and other advanced countries, is an important institution for medical science guidance and promoting practical business, and plays a decisive role in the health cause. However, the Ministry of Health leads this institution with only a few Party member comrades, and has never carried out any work. It only held an informal meeting in 1954, and even the twelve-year medical science plan has never held a discussion meeting, nor has it ever organized scientific experts other than Party members to go to the Soviet Union to investigate specialized business and scientific research.

Cultivating high-level medical cadres is an important link in running the people's health cause well. In the reform of medical education, we have learned from the Soviet Union in recent years and unified the education system, with certain gains; but in the teaching plan for cultivating medical physicians, the socialist healthcare principle of combining medical treatment with prevention has not been implemented; while training health physicians, sound local health and epidemic prevention institutions have not been established, so that the future of students after graduation has become a problem; graduates of pharmaceutical colleges often do not use what they have learned, and important majors have been cancelled.

Hospitals have developed greatly in recent years, but there is still no formal working system. More than a thousand health and epidemic prevention stations have been established, but generally the cadres are poor and the quality of work is low, and there are no formal setting standards. The working systems, working methods, and work plans of many health institutions need to be studied in depth, and problems cannot be completely solved by simply holding meetings and temporarily soliciting some opinions.

In recent years, with the development of industrial construction and agricultural cooperativization, healthcare institution networks with socialist characteristics have been established in cities, rural areas, and industrial and mining areas, and most of the practicing doctors have also been united and organized and included in the government's plans, which is a good aspect. However, due to the fact that the leadership of the health department cannot keep up with the needs of the new situation, many problems are delayed and cannot be resolved, no specific measures can be taken, unreasonable situations cannot be improved in time, and bureaucracy is manifested in many tasks.

In short, in the early days of the People's Republic of China, the health administrative leading departments only relied on experience to handle affairs, and were too subjective in their work. In recent years, they have been cautious in everything and overly rigid in implementing policies. These have often hindered the correct development of the healthcare cause. The main reason for this situation is that the relationship between Party and non-Party personnel is not close enough, and administrative leaders and scientific experts have not been combined. At present, in the health administrative authorities and even in the business institutions, the actual leaders are all Party member comrades. When there are personnel changes, they are just exchanging positions with each other.

Now should be the time for the health department to correct these contradictory phenomena. It is hoped that the leaders of the health department will boldly let go, invite more experts and professional personnel to participate in the leadership of health institutions at all levels, and give them positions and powers to work together to complete the major tasks of national economic construction.

The above opinions are for the reference of the leading comrades of the health administrative departments only. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope you will correct me.

    行政领导同专家要结合起来
    北京医学院卫生系主任　金宝善
    新中国成立之后，几年来在人民健康事业上的成就是巨大的，史无前例的，但是由于卫生行政部门在执行政策上有重要的缺点和错误，给卫生事业带来了一定损失。
    在建国初期，卫生部门的主要缺点是主观主义和宗派主义。这表现在以下各方面。在中医政策上没有看到祖国医学遗产中的科学成分和广大中医在我国卫生事业中所起的作用，而认为中医是不科学的，应当迅速消灭的，因而轻视、歧视中医，没有贯彻中西医团结的正确方针。在卫生防疫工作上，大力防止了鼠疫、天花和霍乱三大烈性传染病，但是对为害人民健康极为严重的寄生虫病如血吸虫病和疟疾等，则没有及早给以足够的重视。在医疗预防方面，迅速地增加了医疗床位和疗养床位，并公布了公费医疗办法；这是好的一面；但不采用苏联的社会主义保健原则，在医疗机构中单纯地发展了只治病、不防病的传统方法，而没有开展医疗与预防相结合的先进工作方法，并且在医疗机构中把原有的一些好的制度打垮了，也没有树立新的工作制度，因而造成了医疗制度和医疗作风的混乱现象。在工业卫生方面，轻重工业、铁道等主管部门，都自设卫生行政领导机构，各自为政，中央卫生部既不统一领导，也没给以有力帮助，以致各地工业部门的医务机构重叠，厂矿卫生和工人保健缺乏业务上的正确领导。在医学教育方面，独出心裁地创设了专科重点制，把高等医学教育的修学年限缩短到二、三年，打乱了全部医学教育制度。在妇幼卫生工作上，推行了新法接生，大力减低了新生儿破伤风和产褥热；这是好的方面；但对托儿站、幼儿园和小学校的健康情况，卫生部门没有主动地联系有关主管机关指导改进，以致儿童保健事业至今还没有开展。
    造成以上这些情况的主要原因是由于卫生行政主管部门的少数领导同志在政治修养不足、科学水平不够和业务经验缺乏的情况下，负起难以胜任的艰巨任务，既不能正确地掌握政策，也未获致有经验的科学工作者的有力帮助，以致在工作执行上造成了不少的缺点和错误。这些情况自从贺诚、王斌两同志被批判以后，在最近几年内，有了好转，在工作上有了一定的改进；但是目前卫生行政领导部门还存在着不少缺点，不仅宗派主义依然如故，并且还滋长了官僚主义。
    为了纠正既往的错误和缺点，卫生部门最近几年来积极的加强政治思想领导，这是非常重要的，但是在社会主义建设的各个专业部门中，不是单靠单纯的政治思想领导就能完全解决业务问题，而是要在具体业务中贯彻政治思想。政治领导同业务领导必须结合为一。要做好这样领导工作的重要条件，必须是领导同志具有足够的政治修养、科学水平和业务经验；或者是具有高度政治修养的领导同志能够获得有经验的科学专家在日常工作上的具体帮助；现在卫生部门所表现的事实，不是完全如此。
    卫生部很早成立了全国医学科学委员会。这样一个组织在苏联和其他先进国家，是医学科学指导和推进实际业务的重要机构，对卫生事业是起决定性的作用的。但是卫生部领导这个机构，只是几位少数党员同志，并且从未开展工作，只在1954年举行一次非正式的会议，甚至十二年医学科学规划，都没开过一次讨论会，也从未组织党员以外的科学专家到苏联去考察专门业务和科学研究情况。
    培养高级医学干部，是办好人民保健事业的重要环节。在医学教育改革上，这几年学习苏联，统一了教育制度，有了一定的收获；但在培养医疗医师的教学计划中，没有贯彻医疗与预防相结合的社会主义保健原则；在培养卫生医师的同时，没有建立健全的地方卫生防疫机构，以致学生毕业后，出路成了问题；药学院系毕业生也往往学非所用，并且重要的专业被取消了。
    这几年来医院有了很大的发展，但至今还没有正规的工作制度。卫生防疫站已上一千个，一般是干部差，工作质量低，没有正规的设置标准。许多卫生机构的工作制度、工作方法和工作计划都须要深入研究，单靠开开会，临时征求一些意见，是不能彻底解决问题的。
    这几年来，随着工业的建设和农业合作化的发展，在城市、农村、工矿里都已建立了社会主义性质的保健机构网，开业医生也已大部分联合组织起来，纳入于政府的规划，这是好的一面，但是由于卫生部门领导力量赶不上新形势发展的需要，许多问题拖拉不决，拿不出具体办法，不合理的情况不能及时改善，在许多工作上表现了官僚主义。
    总之，卫生行政领导部门，在建国初期，领导者仅凭经验办事，在工作中过于主观，最近几年来，则遇事拘谨，执行政策过于刻板，往往这都阻碍了保健事业的正确发展，造成这种情况的主要原因是党与非党人士关系不够密切，行政领导与科学专家没有结合起来。目前卫生行政主管机构甚至在业务机构，实际掌握领导权的，都是党员同志。遇有人事上的调动，也不过是互相换换岗位而已。
    现在应当已是卫生部门纠正这些矛盾现象的时候了，希望卫生部门领导大胆放手，在各级卫生机构中多请专家和专业人员参加领导，并使他们有职有权，共同努力，以完成国家经济建设的重大任务。
    以上所提意见仅供卫生行政部门领导同志参考，如有不妥之处，希予指正。
