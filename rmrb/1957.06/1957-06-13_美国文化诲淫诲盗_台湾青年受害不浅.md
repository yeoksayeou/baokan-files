Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th -- Corrupt American bourgeois culture poisons the youth of Taiwan.

　　Along with "U.S. Aid", the U.S. exports at least 400 films annually to Taiwan promoting the "American way of life," and dumps large quantities of obscene, theft-encouraging, and yellow-covered pictorials, novels, and comic books, poisoning thousands upon thousands of pure Taiwanese youth with the "American way of life." Now, in Taiwan's large and small towns, one can see groups of "Ah Fei" youth dressed in American-style jeans or various outlandish clothes, some even forming gangs and establishing leaders. They gather everywhere to fight, rob with weapons, insult women, and stir up trouble. Recently, in Fengshan Township, Kaohsiung County, a seventeen-year-old middle school student, simply because of a trivial matter, actually agreed with another student to a time and place, each holding a handgun for a duel. As a result, the other student was shot dead. Not long ago, in Keelung City, two eighteen-year-old youths, while traveling by car from Taipei back to Keelung, worked together to tie up the driver, stuffed his mouth with a handkerchief, and robbed him of all his belongings. According to newspaper reports, these two youths came from well-to-do families and were not forced to rob due to financial difficulties. It was simply because they had read many American "professional killer" novels and watched movies promoting martial arts, and they usually had wild fantasies. This time, their robbery was to experience the thrilling stories they saw in movies and novels. It is said that before the robbery, they not only stole a handgun but also spent a sum of money on other preparations.
　　Taiwan's newspapers and periodicals acknowledge that the number of "Ah Fei" youth in Taiwan has become a serious social problem. News of young men and women pursuing a corrupt and degenerate "American way of life," committing suicide or murder for so-called love, and youth insulting women fills Taiwan's newspapers and periodicals. Many Taiwanese newspapers and periodicals point out that the large number of these absurd "yellow incidents" occurring in Taiwan is, in addition to other reasons, greatly related to the spread of the "American way of life" in Taiwan.

　　美国文化诲淫诲盗
　　台湾青年受害不浅
    据新华社广州12日电  美国的腐朽的资产阶级文化毒害着台湾青年。
    随着“美援”而来的，美国每年至少要向台湾推销四百多部宣传“美国生活方式”的电影，和大量倾销诲淫诲盗的黄色的画报、小说书和小人书等，使成千上万纯洁的台湾青年受着“美国生活方式”的毒害。现在台湾的大城小镇，到处都可以看到三五成群的穿着美式牛仔裤或各种奇装异服的“阿飞”青年，有些甚至结帮成派、各设首领。他们到处聚着打架，持械抢劫，污辱妇女，寻衅滋事。最近，高雄县凤山镇一个年仅十七岁的中学生，只为了一点小事，竟然同另一个学生约定时间和地点，各持手枪进行决斗。结果，对方那个学生被打死了。基隆市不久以前也发生了一宗两个十八岁的青年，在从台北乘汽车回到基隆途中，合力将司机绑起，用手绢塞住他的口，抢劫了他所有的财物。据报纸消息，这两个青年家里生活很好，根本不是为了生活所迫而行劫。只是因为他们看了很多美国的“职业凶手”之类小说和宣扬武打的电影，平时即有非非之想。这次他俩行劫，就是要身历一下从电影和小说中看到的惊险故事。据说，他们在行劫前不但先去偷来了一支手枪，而且还花了一笔钱作了其他的准备。
    台湾的报刊都承认，现在台湾“阿飞”青年之多，已成为严重的社会问题。许多青年男女追逐腐化堕落的“美国生活方式”为所谓爱情而自杀或杀人的新闻以及青年污辱妇女的新闻，更充满着台湾的报刊。许多台湾报刊都指出，这类荒唐的“黄色事件”大量在台湾发生，除了其他的原因外，跟“美国生活方式”在台湾的传播有极大的关系。
