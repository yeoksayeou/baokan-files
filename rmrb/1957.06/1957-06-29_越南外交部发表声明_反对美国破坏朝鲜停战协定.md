Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 28th. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement this afternoon opposing the United States' public announcement of its intention to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement and to transport atomic weapons into South Korea.

The statement said that the US statement is a serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which once again proves that the United States is attempting to re-ignite the Korean War and threaten peace in Asia and the world. The statement emphasized that the United States, as a party to the Korean Armistice Agreement, has no right to unilaterally amend or abolish any of the provisions of the agreement.

The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman also said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the proposal made by Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on June 21 that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea and that a conference attended by all relevant countries be convened to resolve the Korean issue.

Finally, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that the United States' vicious conspiracy will be defeated, and that the Korean people will accomplish the cause of their country's reunification.
