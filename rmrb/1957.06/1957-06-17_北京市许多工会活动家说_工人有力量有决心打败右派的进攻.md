Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: At a forum held today by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, many industry and factory union chairmen of worker origin refuted anti-socialist statements and called on all employees in the city to use practical actions to step up socialist construction and welcome the Party's birthday.

　　Zhang Tingyao, chairman of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Union, said that Ge Peiqi's statement that the people's living standards have not improved is unfounded. Take our factory as an example. Before liberation, employees had no guarantee of life. We ate this meal but didn’t know where the next was coming from, and no one cared if we got sick. After liberation, the Party and the government cared for us very much, and the factory's labor insurance expenses alone amounted to 120,000 to 180,000 yuan each year. Employees' wages have increased, averaging about 50% more than in 1950. Our factory was built in 1901. In the forty-eight years until liberation, only more than 4,000 square meters of housing were built for foreigners and supervisors, and workers couldn't even live in a single dormitory room. In the mere eight years since liberation, more than 64,000 square meters of employee dormitories have been built, an increase of more than fifteen times compared to before liberation. Employees' welfare undertakings have also gradually developed along with the development of production: the hospital has been expanded, and new libraries, canteens, dairy farms, sanatoriums, nurseries, kindergartens, and nursing rooms have been built. Zhang Tingyao said that these ironclad facts cannot be denied by the rightists. The relationship between our workers and the Party is not ten thousand miles apart as Ge Peiqi said, but one heart. The rightists' attempt to provoke the relationship between the Party and the working people is a waste of effort.

　　Wang Yushan, chairman of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Construction Trade Union, refuted Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" with facts. He said that in Beijing's construction enterprises, 80% of the leaders are non-Party members. Among the thirty-six principal responsible persons in the six construction companies, only one-third are Party members. Please tell me, Chu Anping, what is the basis for your saying "the Party's world"? Wang Yushan also refuted Ge Peiqi's fallacy that the people's lives have not improved after liberation. He said that among construction workers before liberation, there was a saying of "three deaths": "Sunstroke in summer, drenched to death in the rain, and frozen to death in winter." Now, construction workers have heatstroke prevention equipment for construction in summer, rain gear for rainy days, and large cotton-padded jackets in winter.

　　Gao Zhaowen, vice chairman of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Commercial Trade Union, said that at the beginning of liberation, the bourgeoisie attacked the working class economically with "five poisons" and were defeated by us. This time, the rightists are attacking the working class politically, and we also have the determination and strength to defeat them. The Party and the government formulated a redemption policy stipulating fixed interest for seven years. For the sake of socialist interests, our working class is willing to endure being exploited on fixed interest for another seven years. All bourgeois elements with conscience should thank the Party and the government for their care and sincerely accept transformation. However, the rightists even proposed fixed interest for twenty years and the withdrawal of public representatives. Our working class will never agree.

　　北京市许多工会活动家说
　　工人有力量有决心打败右派的进攻
    据新华社16日讯　在北京市工会联合会今天召开的座谈会上，许多工人出身的产业和工厂工会主席驳斥了反社会主义的言论，并且向全市职工提出要用实际行动加紧建设社会主义，迎接党的生日。
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂工会主席张廷瑶说，葛佩琦说人民生活水平没有提高是没有根据的。就拿我们工厂来说，在解放前，职工生活毫无保障，吃了这顿没有那顿，生了病更没有人管。解放后，党和政府对我们十分关怀，每年为工厂开支的劳保费就有十二万到十八万元。职工们的工资都增加了，平均比1950年增加了50％左右。我们工厂是1901年建厂的，到解放为止的四十八年中，只为外国人和总管们建了四千多平方公尺的住宅，工人连一间宿舍也住不上。解放到现在仅仅八年，就盖了六万四千多平方公尺的职工宿舍，比解放前增加了十五倍以上。职工们的福利事业也随着生产的发展在逐步发展：扩大了医院，新建了图书馆、食堂、牛奶场、疗养所、托儿所、幼儿园和哺乳室等。张廷瑶说，这些铁的事实是右派分子们抹煞不了的。我们工人和党的关系不是葛佩琦所说的距离十万八千里，而是一条心。右派分子企图挑拨党和劳动人民的关系是枉费心机。
    中国建筑工会北京市委员会主席王玉山用事实驳斥了储安平的“党天下”谬论。他说，在北京的建筑企业里，有80％的领导人员都是非党员。六个建筑工程公司里的三十六个主要负责人，只有三分之一是党员。请问储安平，你说“党天下”是根据什么？王玉山也驳斥了葛佩琦所说的解放后人民生活没有改善的谬论。他说，解放前建筑工人中流传着“三死”的说法：“夏天晒死，下雨淋死，冬天冻死”。而现在，建筑工人们夏天施工有防暑设备，下雨有防雨工具，冬天有大棉袄。
    中国商业工会北京市委会副主席高肇文说，解放初期资产阶级用“五毒”从经济上向工人阶级进攻被我们打败了，这次右派分子从政治上向工人阶级进攻，我们同样有决心和有力量把它打败。党和政府制订的赎买政策规定定息七年，我们工人阶级为了社会主义利益，愿意再忍受七年在定息上的被剥削，凡是有良心的资产阶级分子，应当感谢党和政府的照顾，诚心诚意接受改造。可是右派分子竟提出定息二十年和撤出公方代表，我们工人阶级决不答应。
