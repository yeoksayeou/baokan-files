    American Warmongers are Inhuman
    Actually Want to Use Living People to Test Hydrogen Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th - According to the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper, the United States Atomic Energy Commission has decided to use living people to test the effectiveness of hydrogen weapons. The commission has selected the Amazon jungle in Latin America as the test site. It is announced that this is the “ideal” region to test the effects of the radioactive element Strontium-90. The commission also said murderously that, as test subjects, the radiation consequences for Indian migrants who are away from other supplies of goods "will certainly come faster than in other regions."

    美国黩武者灭绝人性
    竟要用活人试验氢武器
    新华社柏林15日电　据“新德意志报”报道，美国原子能委员会决定用活人来试验氢武器的效能。这个委员会选择拉丁美洲的亚马孙河丛林作为试验地点。据宣布，那里是试验放射性原素锶——九○作用的“理想”地区。这个委员会还杀气腾腾地说，作为试验对象，离开其他物品供应中心的印地安移民的辐射后果“一定会比其他地区来得快”。
