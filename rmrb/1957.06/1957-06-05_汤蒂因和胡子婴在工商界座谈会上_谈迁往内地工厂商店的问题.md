At a symposium with industrial and commercial circles convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Tang Di'yin, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Hu Zi'ying, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, respectively reported on their recent inspections of the relocation of coastal factories and shops to the Northwest and their opinions on the matter.

Tang Di'yin said that they inspected three areas in the Northwest: Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. A significant number of factories and shops have been relocated to these areas, along with many personnel. After relocating, they have played a significant role in strengthening the technical capabilities of the interior, solving key technical problems, trial-manufacturing new products, increasing new varieties, and helping local people and relocated personnel solve living difficulties. For example, the pigment workshop of a paint factory in Xi'an City had stopped production due to a technical problem. After a technician was transferred from Shanghai, not only was the production of the pigment workshop restored, but also many new varieties were created, and costs were reduced. As another example, Luoyang City only had more than 20,000 kinds of commodities in the first half of 1955. After the relocation of shops from the coastal areas, it has now increased to more than 50,000 kinds. The local Party and government generally attach importance to the work arrangements and living care of the relocated personnel. In terms of work, they ensure that positions are not lowered, and some have even been promoted. Some private personnel have also been elected as municipal people's representatives or CPPCC members. In terms of business operations, the local authorities also provide great care, giving the best locations to the relocated factories and shops, or building large buildings for them separately, such as the Shanghai Market and Guangzhou Market in Luoyang, and the Xi'an Service Building, which are all newly built. In terms of living conditions, rice is provided to southerners as much as possible, southern-style kitchens are set up, and bath water is also provided as much as possible to accommodate the hygiene habits of southerners. However, the overall sentiment of the relocated personnel is homesickness and unease, and they request to return to Shanghai. Some individuals have even caused trouble because of this.

There are many problems: 1. The wage issue is the most numerous and acute. The wage category stipulated by the central government does not match the actual local price situation. 2. The resettlement allowances in Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou are not the same. Some areas have cancelled them, while others have not. The workers also have opinions on this. 3. The issue of returning home to visit relatives also needs to be resolved. 4. The issue of family employment: the contract stated that family members could be employed when they were mobilized to relocate. This year, due to the State Council's personnel freeze, it has become difficult to arrange for family employment. Some have been arranged to work as experimental workers, and they cannot be transferred to regular positions after the term expires. 5. The labor insurance benefits for family members in the countryside have not been handled in accordance with Article 48 of the Labor Insurance Regulations. 6. Family dormitories are far from sufficient, and the distribution is also somewhat unreasonable. 7. The number of doctors and nurses is small, the quality is poor, and there are many accidents. Some people reported that "life is not guaranteed." 8. There are also problems with the nature of enterprises. For example, Yuebinlou has 47 employees and has been jointly operated for a long time, but now it is treated as a small vendor and is required to be responsible for its own profits and losses. 9. Some industries cannot maintain their original operating characteristics. For example, a wool shop now consigns Western suits. 10. In terms of personnel arrangements, private personnel in Xi'an are arranged as directors and deputy directors, most of which are temporary without formal appointments. 11. Insufficient attention is paid to labor protection. Open-air operations in the Luoyang foundry affect health. 12. Elderly, weak, and chronically ill people have no recuperation conditions in the local area. They requested to be transferred back to Shanghai, but this has not been resolved. 13. The relocated personnel lack the idea of settling down. They hope to formulate contracts for regular support, and after the term expires, they have the freedom to choose. 14. The situation of enterprise losses is quite common. They arrived early, had large expenses, and had to bear the cost of relocation, renovation, and work stoppage losses. Therefore, the enthusiasm of employees and private individuals is low. There are also many problems with other living habits and the relationship between local and external personnel.

Next, Hu Zi'ying spoke, analyzing why the relocated personnel have a sense of unease. She believes that there are nine objective reasons: 1. Unaccustomed to living conditions. Living conditions in coastal areas are different from those in the interior. For example, southerners like to take baths, while locals do not like it. Other aspects such as transportation, sanitation, and diet are also not as convenient as in coastal cities. 2. Different natural conditions, such as more sandstorms, colder and drier climate, and higher air pressure. 3. Different languages. It is difficult for locals to understand people from Guangdong and Shanghai, which can easily lead to isolation. 4. Propaganda work has serious one-sidedness. 5. Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou originally had a very poor foundation, and development is too fast, so many welfare facilities have not kept up. 6. Construction plans are delayed, or some construction plans are tightened, which is not consistent with the original plan to relocate factories and shops. This has resulted in too many relocated shops and service industries. 7. There are contradictions between the tasks of the central government's directly affiliated factories and local factories. Some tasks are undertaken by the central government's directly affiliated factories, and the local factories do not have enough work. 8. There are differences in wage treatment between central government's directly affiliated factories and local factories. 9. The central government's classification of wage areas is not entirely consistent with the actual local situation. These are all objective reasons for the unease of the relocated personnel.

In addition to objective reasons, she believes that there are also many subjective reasons. She said: First of all, the relocation of factories and shops is blind. There is no good research on the local situation. When the relocation of factories and shops is requested, it is like the emperor choosing a concubine, pointing to one and that is the one. For example, those relocated to Luoyang are all first-class brand-name stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, which is not very appropriate. The Lihua Ink Factory relocated to Lanzhou. In fact, except for the water, which is local, all raw materials are still transported from Shanghai, resulting in a cost that is higher than the price of ink transported from Shanghai. Second, promises are made randomly during mobilization, with serious one-sidedness, saying that they will live in Western-style houses and drink milk like tap water, etc., but the actual situation is not like that. Third, cadres cannot share the joys and sorrows with workers. Eating and housing are divided into grades, resulting in a very deep gap. Fourth, the work style is rigid, and there is a lack of democratic style. Any opinions given to leaders are considered backward. Even rationalization proposals are seen as sabotage. An accountant at the Lanzhou Lihua Ink Factory was transferred to another unit for making rationalization proposals. Wang Jiaming, a private individual from the Wang Rongkang Western Clothing Store who moved from Shanghai to Lanzhou, was transferred to a department store as a clerk because his brother made suggestions. Tian Guangren, Minister of Finance and Trade of Lanzhou, said to the employees of Xinda Xiang in a report: "You (referring to private individuals) want democracy, I want dictatorship. You want freedom, I want discipline." He even scolded at the conference that the brand of Wang Rongkang was not worth two cents. This Minister Tian Guangren even knocked out the tooth of a private individual when he went to buy a leather bag, and as a result, he reported to the police station and gave six yuan for medical expenses in a muddled manner. Fifth, right and wrong are unclear, and the policy boundaries are not clear. For example, some officials in Luoyang buy cloth without cloth tickets. When the problem is brought to the professional company, the manager of the professional company does not support it at all, but pushes the responsibility to the private individuals. Sixth, the law and discipline are not strict. A handyman in the Lanzhou Dazhonghua Restaurant beat a private individual, and employees of Xinda Xiang beat a private individual. They reported to the professional company, the Minjian, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, but it has not been resolved. Seventh, market management is not strict, and prices are arbitrarily raised. Even on the same street, the same things have several prices. Eighth, social security work is not done well. Theft, robbery, fraud, and other phenomena often occur in Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Luoyang. Ninth, ideological education is poor. There are phenomena of disunity in the above three regions. Some demobilized soldiers consider themselves heroes and still do not study their profession after several years of demobilization, thinking that they had made contributions in the past and should now enjoy themselves. She suggested that relevant departments strengthen their education. Tenth, in many units, the Party, government, and trade union are integrated, and everything is decided by one person, and the role of organizations cannot be brought into play. The local democratic parties, people's organizations, federations of industry and commerce, women's federations, and Minjian have not played their due roles.

She made several suggestions to the central government regarding wages and other issues.

Finally, she hoped that everyone could make suggestions based on facts. She said that in the past few days, she felt that all the theories had become dogmas, and all the criticisms had become labels. It is best not to exaggerate, as it is not good for oneself.

Pan Yangyao, Deputy Manager of Shanghai Yongxin Raincoat Dyeing and Weaving Factory, made a written statement. He believes that Li Kangnian's suggestion of 20 years of fixed interest is a very bold, very humble, and very valuable suggestion, and he agrees with this suggestion. However, he has some different opinions on the specific implementation. He said that the "end" of redemption to the "end" should refer to the "end" of the Party and government helping us to reform to the end; the redemption time should be calculated from 1949; the private party accepting the redemption certificate does not mean taking off the hat, but should continue to strengthen learning and earnestly reform oneself.

    汤蒂因和胡子婴在工商界座谈会上
    谈迁往内地工厂商店的问题
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会，昨天举行第十五次座谈。会上，中国民建会上海市委员会副主任委员汤蒂因和上海市工商联副主任委员胡子婴分别汇报了她们最近到西北地区视察沿海工厂、商店内迁工作的问题和她们的意见。
    汤蒂因说：她们这次到西北共视察了洛阳、西安、兰州三个地区，这三个地区内迁的工厂、商店都不少，内迁人员也很多。他们内迁后，对于壮大内地技术力量、解决技术上的关键问题，以及试制新产品、增加新品种，以及对当地人民和内迁人员解决生活方面的困难，都起了很大作用。如西安市有个油漆厂的颜料车间，因某项技术问题不能解决而停工，从上海调去了一个技术人员后，不但恢复了颜料车间的生产，还创制了不少新品种，降低了成本。再如洛阳市1955年上半年只有两万多种商品，沿海地区商店迁去以后，现在已经增加到五万多种。当地党、政对于内迁人员工作上的安排，生活上的照顾一般也是重视的。在工作上，做到职位不降低，有的还得到了提拔；有的私方人员还当选为市人民代表或政协委员等。在经营上当地也给予极大的照顾，把最好的地段让出来给内迁厂店，或者为内迁厂店单独造大楼，如洛阳的上海市场、广州市场，西安服务大楼等都是新建的。在生活方面，把大米尽量让给南方人吃，办南方灶，洗澡用水也尽量照顾南方人的卫生习惯。但是，内迁人员总的情绪是想家，不安心，要求回上海，个别的还有为此闹事的。
    存在的问题不少：一、工资问题是最多最尖锐的问题，中央规定的工资地区类别同地区物价的实际情况不相符合。二、在洛阳、西安、兰州三个地区的安家费各不一致，有的地区已经取消，有的地区没有取消，工人们对此也有意见。三、回家省亲问题也需要解决。四、家属就业问题：在动员内迁时合同中写明家属可以就业；今年受国务院人事冻结的限制，家属安排就发生了困难，有的安排下来做试验工，满期了也不能转正。五、对在乡家属的劳保待遇，没有按照劳保条例四十八条规定办理。六、家属宿舍远远不够，在分配上也有些不合理。七、医生、护士的数量少、质量差，事故多。有人反映“生命没有保障”。八、关于企业的性质也有问题，如悦宾楼有四十七个职工，早就合营了，现在却以小商小贩看待，要自负盈亏。九、有些行业不能保持原有经营特点，如一个绒线店现在寄卖西服。十、在人事安排上，西安的私方人员安排为主任副主任，大都是临时性的没有正式任命。十一、不重视劳动保护，洛阳翻砂厂露天作业影响健康。十二、年老体弱慢性病的人在当地没有休养条件，要求调回上海，也没有解决。十三、内迁人员中缺乏生根落户的思想，他们希望制订合同，定期支援，期满以后，自由抉择。十四、企业亏本情况相当普遍，他们去得早、开支大，加上迁移费、装修费、停工损失，都要企业负担，因此，职工与私方的经营情绪都低落，其他生活不习惯，本地与外来的关系问题也很多。
    接着，胡子婴发言，她分析内迁人员为什么会有不安情绪。她认为客观原因有九：一，生活不习惯，沿海生活条件和内地生活条件不同，例如南方人喜欢洗澡，而当地人就看不惯。其他如交通、清洁卫生以及饮食等也都没有沿海城市方便。二，自然条件不同，风沙多、气候冷、干燥，气压也较高。三，语言不同，当地人听广东、上海等地人说话很困难，也容易产生隔阂。四，宣传工作有严重的片面性。五，洛阳、西安、兰州原来基础太差，建设发展的太快，许多福利设施都没有跟上去。六，基建计划推迟，或者有些基建计划紧缩，和原来既定的迁厂迁店计划不衔接。这样迁去的商店和服务性行业就多出来了。七，中央直属厂和地方厂任务有矛盾，有些任务，中央直属厂担负了，地方厂吃不饱。八，中央直属厂和地方厂的工资待遇有差别。九，中央的工资地区分类不尽切合当地实际情况。这些都是造成内迁人员不安心的客观原因。
    除了客观原因以外，她认为也有很多主观原因。她说：首先是迁厂迁店的盲目性，没有很好地研究当地的情况，在提出迁厂迁店要求时，好像皇帝选妃子一般，点着那一家就是那一家。例如迁到洛阳去的都是上海南京路上第一流的名牌店，这样并不是太合适的。迁到兰州去的丽华墨水厂实际上除了水是当地的以外，什么原料仍都从上海运过去，结果成本反比从上海运去的墨水价钱高。第二，动员时乱许愿，有严重的片面性，说什么住洋房、牛奶当开水喝等，而实际情况不是那样。第三，干部不能和工人同甘共苦，吃饭住房子样样都分等级，以致造成很深的鸿沟。第四，作风生硬，民主风度不够，凡是给领导提意见就认为是落后。甚至提合理化建议，也看成是捣蛋。兰州丽华墨水厂一位会计因为提合理化建议竟调到别的单位去。从上海迁到兰州去的王荣康西服店的私方人员王嘉明的兄弟因为提意见，被调到百货商店当办事员。兰州财贸部田广仁部长对信大祥的职工报告时说：“你（指私方人员）要民主、我要专政。你要自由、我要纪律”。甚至在大会上骂王荣康的牌子不值二角钱。这位田广仁部长去买皮包竟打掉一个私方人员的牙齿，结果告到派出所给了六块钱的药费糊糊涂涂了事。第五，是非不明，政策界限不清，例如洛阳有的机关人员买布不给布票，问题闹到专业公司，专业公司经理根本不支持，反把责任推到私方人员身上。第六，法纪不严，兰州大中华菜馆勤杂工打私方人员，信大祥职工打私方人员，向专业公司、民建、工商联反映，但一直得不到解决。第七，市场管理不严，随便哄抬物价，甚至一条街，同样的东西价钱却有几种。第八，社会治安工作搞的不好，在兰州、西安、洛阳都常常发生偷、抢、诈骗等现象。第九，思想教育差。在上述三个地区都存在着闹不团结的现象。有些转业军人以功臣自居，转业几年仍不学习业务，认为过去有功，现在应该享福了。她建议有关部门加强对他们的教育。第十，很多单位党、政、工会三位一体，什么事都由一个人作主，不能发挥组织作用，当地的民主党派、人民团体、工商联、妇联、民建等都没起到应有的作用。
    她向中央提了有关工资等问题的几点建议。
    最后，她希望大家能实事求是的提意见。她说，最近几天她感觉凡是讲理论都变成了教条，凡是批评都变成了帽子。最好不要夸张，这样对自己没好处。
    上海永新雨衣染织厂副经理潘仰尧作了书面发言。他认为李康年关于定息二十年的建议，是个极大胆、极虚心、极有价值的建议，他同意这个建议。但在具体实施方面有些不同意见，他说，赎买到“底”的“底”字应该是指党和政府帮助我们改造到底的“底”；赎买时间应该从1949年算起；私方接受了赎买存单，并不是就摘下帽子，而应该继续加强学习，认真改造自己。
