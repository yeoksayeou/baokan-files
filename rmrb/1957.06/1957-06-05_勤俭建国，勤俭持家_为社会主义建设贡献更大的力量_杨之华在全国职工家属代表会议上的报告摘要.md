In the past few years, the national work regarding workers' family members has correctly implemented the方針 of serving production and serving the masses. The level of organization and awareness of workers' family members across the country has gradually improved. According to statistics from the end of 1956, 11,389 family committees were established in concentrated residential areas of workers' family members, organizing approximately 1,517,957 households with 4,387,997 people. The vast majority of workers' family members living in dispersed areas participated in street women's congresses. In the various political movements of the past few years, the broad masses of workers' family members have gradually raised their awareness, changed the idea that "old women don't care about world affairs," and established, to varying degrees, the idea that labor is glorious and loving the factory is like loving one's home. They have combined their household labor with supporting the production of their loved ones, helping their loved ones with household chores, preparing meals, washing clothes, and taking care of children, so that their loved ones can eat well, rest well, and be encouraged to work diligently and actively in production without being late or missing work. They have universally carried out solidarity and mutual assistance work among neighbors, establishing a new social relationship and social atmosphere of mutual care, solving many difficulties in workers' families such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, and illness, and helping factories and mines improve their attendance rates. Many grassroots workers' family members have relied on their own strength to organize children, who have received good education, enabling themselves to participate in cultural and political studies and improve their cultural and political levels. Many workers' family members have actively participated in grassroots political work and local social activities, responded to the Party's call, and implemented national policies and laws, playing the role of a pillar of grassroots political power.

Old China left us with a long-term backward agricultural country with a very poor foundation. To transform a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, it is impossible without the long-term arduous labor of the people of the whole country. Our workers' family members should support socialist construction with the spirit of diligence and frugality in household management.

	Overcome Difficulties Through Self-Reliance

Now there are many difficulties before us, such as not enough housing, queuing to buy vegetables, difficulty buying non-staple foods, crowded buses on Sundays, difficulties for children entering schools, and so on. But these are difficulties brought about by the rapid development of the motherland's construction, difficulties in victory.

What to do if there is not enough housing? According to the experience of various places, relying on our own strength, there are still some solutions. One way is to build it ourselves. When 129 households of the 18th detachment of the Second Railway Engineering Section's tunnel team arrived at the new construction site, many people had no housing. The family committee contacted the section leaders and the local people's committee, used a hillside that could not be cultivated, mobilized the family members to buy some materials themselves, helped the workers build more than 60 houses, which the workers called "Family New Village." Last year, during the rainy season, more than 40 houses of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory were blown down by strong winds. With the spirit of class friendship, the workers' family members first took in the workers whose houses had collapsed to live temporarily, and then contributed their labor and rebuilt more than 40 houses with the workers in four weeks. Another way is for workers with relatively high mobility in production, who have families in the countryside, to return to the countryside to participate in labor as much as possible. Another way is to promote the spirit of proletarian friendship and adjust housing among each other. In addition to this, there may be many other ways to solve the housing problem, such as self-built public assistance or mutual labor to build houses, etc. After building our own houses, we can avoid paying rent. For self-built and publicly-assisted houses, after a period of time, we can also avoid paying rent. In this way, wouldn't it solve the housing problem for workers without increasing the burden on the state?

Many workers' family members have overcome the difficulty of insufficient supply of materials by their own efforts. The Urqihan Station of the Yalin Railway organized family members to grow vegetables in the spring of 1956. By the end of July last year, they had produced more than 62,000 jin of various vegetables, allowing each person to eat 1.4 jin of vegetables per day. In the past, it was difficult to buy tofu at the Wanshan Mercury Mine in Guizhou, so family members ground their own; it was difficult to eat meat, so family members raised their own pigs and sheep; during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, family members slaughtered three pigs weighing more than 100 jin each, so that the workers could all eat meat.

	The Most Important Thing is Diligence and Frugality in Household Management

Our workers' family members should respond to the Party's call to increase production and practice economy, and contribute our strength and wisdom to the socialist cause. How can we contribute our strength? The most fundamental and central point is to be diligent and frugal in managing our households.

The content of diligence and frugality in household management is multifaceted. Over the past few years, workers' family members across the country have created many examples in this regard. Now I will just cite some examples to show the significant role of diligence and frugality in household management in supporting national construction.

To be diligent and frugal in household management, we must live our lives carefully. Zhu Shulan, the wife of Qian Wenlu, a foundry worker at the Changchun Patriotic Transportation Equipment Factory, came from a poor family. She relied on her family to do everything themselves, from whitewashing walls to building stoves and making clothes. She gave her husband's monthly salary of 84 yuan to her, and after deducting the necessary living expenses, she could still have a surplus. Over the years, she and her husband have insisted on implementing a family life plan. When they had fewer children, they had a lot of savings and planned to purchase necessary supplies. Now, even though they have a family of eight, the whole family lives well, and they still have more than 1,400 yuan deposited in the bank. More than 36,000 households of workers' family members in Liaoyuan and Huainan coal mines carefully managed their lives. In the past few years, they have saved a total of 916,000 yuan.

The vast majority of workers' family members across the country understand the principle that only by carefully managing their lives can they do a good job in household affairs. However, there are also a few workers and their family members who do not quite understand this principle. They think that in today's socialist society, there is no fear of unemployment, no worry about food and clothing, no need to provide for old age, no need to worry about children, no need to build houses and buy land, and no need to leave a way out. In any case, the trade union will provide relief in case of difficulties, and the state will help solve them. These ideas are of course wrong. They have a misunderstanding that since our country is the country of the people, it should take care of all the difficulties in the people's lives and rely on the state to solve everything. Our country cares about the lives of the masses of people. The state concentrates its efforts on building socialism, which ultimately is for the overall interests and fundamental long-term interests of the people of the whole country. The state is also trying its best to solve the current difficulties in the lives of the masses of people. However, the difficulties in the lives of workers' families cannot be solved without the efforts of the broad masses of workers and their family members.

In socialist construction, the supply of grain, coal, water and electricity, and cotton cloth is relatively tight. Because of the rapid development of industrial construction, some difficulties cannot but arise in these areas. More than 7,000 households of workers' family members in Hegang Coal Mine saved 75 tons of coal in five months, and more than 10,000 households of workers' family members saved 422,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in nine months, which is equivalent to the electricity needed to weave 50,000 meters of cloth. If there are 20 million workers in the country, with a family of three, there are 60 million people. If each person saves one inch of cloth, it will be enough to make 400,000 sets of uniforms. How great a force it is to support construction if every household pays attention to thriftiness!

In addition to living carefully, diligence and frugality in household management can also be based on the needs of production and the masses, local conditions, and the labor capacity of family members, and organize various diversified sideline productions in a manner appropriate to local conditions to increase family income and improve family life. For example, after the 69 households of family members of the Mojing Highway Maintenance Section organized wasteland reclamation and other sideline productions, in 1956, they solved the living difficulties of nine workers who had long relied on trade union relief. All the family members in the section also paid off debts of 460 yuan, added 96 sets of clothes for adults and children, sewed 13 quilts, and purchased 5 bed sheets and mosquito nets each. They also deposited more than 400 yuan in the bank and invested 169 yuan in the family savings mutual aid group. All eight classes in the section did not have to buy vegetables for the whole year or half a year. Four units, including the Liaoyang Gunny Sack Factory, had 187 households in difficulty, but after the family members participated in sideline production, they no longer needed trade union relief.

In addition, organizing family members to engage in service-oriented sideline production, such as sewing and laundry, is also welcomed by workers. The family production cooperative of the Yunnan Second Engineering Company carried out various sideline productions and received good comments from workers. They said: "There is a sewing group for wearing and repairing clothes, a needlework group for wearing shoes and repairing socks, a laundry group for dirty clothes, a non-staple food group for hungry stomachs, a vegetable growing group for wanting to eat vegetables, and a pig raising group for wanting to eat meat. If you need crushed stones, there is a temporary worker group, it's really good!" This is the benefit of relying on the masses to find solutions.

Our workers' family members and workers should recognize that household labor and labor in factories and mines are both labor for building socialism, both are glorious, and both should be respected.

As the saying goes, "When the whole family is of one mind, yellow earth can be turned into gold." The solidarity and mutual assistance of the whole family are the basic conditions for doing a good job in household affairs and also the foundation of family happiness. Since liberation, many happy new families have emerged across the country. Wang Fengwu, a worker at the Datong Coal Mine, and his wife, Feng Sannv, plan their family expenses together and take care of each other in every possible way. When Wang Fengwu encountered difficulties in improving the 300-horsepower winch and was in a bad mood, Feng Sannv encouraged him to discuss solutions with other comrades and persist in research, and finally succeeded. The winch has been operating safely for 1,815 days. Wang Fengwu has never been late or left early in the past five years and has become a national model worker. Wang Fengwu also encouraged Feng Sannv to study and participate in social activities, and offered ideas to help her do her work well and helped her do some heavier housework. They also often held family meetings with their children to talk about family matters and inspire them to be diligent, united, and study well. The children have all become Young Pioneers.

	Solidarity and Mutual Assistance in Running Collective Welfare Undertakings

Workers' family members often have many difficulties, such as childbirth, illness, and taking care of children. According to the situation in various places, these difficulties have been resolved in places where solidarity and mutual assistance are well done. They help pregnant women with heavy household chores, help new mothers boil water, cook, and take care of children, and help patients find doctors, go to hospitals, and take care of household chores. Some even feed patients and give blood transfusions. They also assist each other in handling weddings and funerals or organize to buy vegetables, grain, and coal briquettes and deliver meals to workers. Solidarity and mutual assistance among family members can not only help each other overcome difficulties but also reduce workers' worries about their families, prevent them from missing work or being absent, and encourage workers to work more diligently and actively in production.

Over the past few years, an atmosphere of solidarity and mutual assistance has been established among the broad masses of workers' family members. According to statistics from the end of 1956, there were a total of 37,972 mutual aid groups in concentrated residential areas of workers' family members, with more than 450,000 participating workers' family members. Many solidarity and mutual assistance activities have also been carried out among workers' family members living in dispersed areas. In the solidarity and mutual assistance work of workers' family members, carrying out family savings mutual aid work is very important. In Wuhan alone, there are 4,052 savings mutual aid groups among workers' family members. The masses say that savings mutual aid has three advantages: first, using small change for big purposes is good for oneself; second, helping households in difficulty is good for others; and third, depositing money in the bank is good for the country.

Many workers' family members have actively participated in the work of kindergartens and nurseries. According to statistics from the end of 1956, there were a total of 1,774 nurseries and kindergartens run by workers' family members in concentrated residential areas across the country, accommodating 91,830 children. Nurseries and kindergartens run in urban streets accommodate more than 1 million children, most of which are run by workers' family members. This is a new socialist collective welfare undertaking. It has created great convenience for workers' family members to raise their children; it is also a place to cultivate the next generation of our working class in the spirit of communism. We should cherish it, support it, and develop it more and better. We ask all those who are enthusiastic about running these undertakings to be as careful as they are in managing their households and to implement this 方針 in all kindergartens and nurseries.

Many kindergartens and nurseries run by workers' family members have been established through their own efforts and cooperation with workers, overcoming many difficulties. For example, workers' family members in Gonghe Street, Anshan, built their own kindergarten, collecting bricks, donating bricks, and removing blocked old latrines, accumulating more than 10,000 bricks. They also took the initiative to obtain support from relevant administrative departments, collected some civil engineering materials, and asked the district health team to help transport them. Forty-two workers volunteered their labor on Sundays, and 92 family members participated in voluntary labor. They spent a total of six Sundays and built five brand-new houses. For example, the kindergartens and nurseries of Wuchang Shipyard, Nanchang Railway, Changzhou Qishuyan Vehicle Factory, Fushun Laohutai Mine, and other units were all built by the family members themselves. Workers used waste wood to make small tables and stools for the kindergartens and nurseries in their spare time, and family members also gave or lent extra basins, water bottles, spittoons, toys, and other things to the nurseries and kindergartens.

While we must raise our children well, we must also pay attention to planned and controlled births. In this regard, male workers should take more responsibility.

The issue of children going to school and entering schools is of greatest concern to parents. However, our country is now facing a practical problem, that is, there are many people entering schools, but the country's capacity to run schools is limited, and not all students can continue to enter schools after graduation. For school-age children who cannot go to school for the time being, we still rely on our own efforts to organize them to study. That is to say, on the one hand, we must organize those school-age children and invite educated workers' family members to serve as teachers; on the other hand, for children and young people who cannot enter schools, we should encourage them to participate in labor. Those who have families in the countryside should especially encourage their children to go home to participate in agricultural production and continue to study in labor.

Over the past few years, workers' family members across the country have shown great enthusiasm for cultural learning and political learning, and have made great progress. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Women's Federation at the end of 1956, a total of 540,826 workers' family members in concentrated residential areas regularly participated in cultural learning. In Shanghai, 340,000 workers' family members participated in learning during the literacy campaign, and more than 10,000 workers' family members served as teachers. Workers' family members in the Beifengwo dormitory of the Beijing Railway Administration have run 17 cultural learning classes themselves in the past four years, with more than 400 family members removing the label of illiteracy, 67 family members graduating from primary school, and 20 graduating from higher primary school. The teachers are entirely made up of educated family members. Many workers' family members also have a tenacious spirit of learning. Many illiterate workers' family members are now able to read books, read newspapers, and write letters. Comrade Chen Guizhen has become an amateur writer from an ordinary family member.

	The Direction of Effort for Workers' Family Members
	——Achieving "Five Goods"

According to the requirements of the state and the experience of workers' family work over the past few years, the basic tasks of the current national workers' family work are to educate workers' family members to raise awareness, strengthen unity, implement "Five Goods," and serve socialism.

According to the above tasks, we require workers' family members across the country to strive to achieve "Five Goods": good diligence and frugality in household management; good unity and mutual assistance; good education of children; good cleanliness and hygiene; and good diligence in learning. Achieving "Five Goods" means encouraging workers' production enthusiasm for workers' families; it means serving production for enterprises; and it means supporting construction for our country.

Among the "Five Goods," we should focus on "good diligence and frugality in household management." Because diligence and frugality in household management are not only the requirements for doing a good job in household affairs, but also the requirements for diligence and frugality in national construction. If the working class and the people of the whole country can promote the style of diligence and frugality, and promote the spirit of overcoming difficulties to govern the country and manage their households, then difficulties will not be able to overwhelm us, and our country's socialism will surely be built well, and our family's happy new life will surely be established.

Of course, the "Five Goods" I mentioned above are just general requirements for workers' family members across the country and do not limit the many other aspects of work of many workers' family members outside of these "Five Goods," such as actively participating in social activities. The situations in various regions and industries are different, and the requirements of the central tasks in various periods are also different. Therefore, when specifically implementing the "Five Goods," we can also flexibly apply them according to the specific circumstances of the local area at that time, especially according to the requirements of the family members.

How should the national workers' family work be done in the future?

First, we must trust the masses and rely on the masses themselves to do it. Second, the activists in family work are activists who are enthusiastic about serving production, the masses, and the public interests. In the future, if family work is to be carried out well, we must still rely on the activities of the broad masses of activists among the masses. Third, strengthen the leadership of trade unions over the work of workers' family members, especially strengthen the work of workers' family members in new industrial areas and newly built factories and mines, and give full play to the role of family committees. Fourth, we must better obtain the leadership of the Party and obtain the support of the enterprise administration. Cadres and activists in the work of workers' family members should take the initiative to gather the emotions, requirements, and opinions of the masses, study them, put forward reasonable and feasible opinions, and promptly reflect them to the Party, the administration, and grassroots political power, and take the initiative to request instructions from the Party and request support from the administration and grassroots political power.

    勤俭建国，勤俭持家
    为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量
    杨之华在全国职工家属代表会议上的报告摘要
    几年来的全国职工家属工作，正确地贯彻了为生产服务、为群众服务的方针，全国职工家属的组织程度和觉悟程度逐渐提高了。根据1956年底的统计，在集中居住的职工家属中，建立了一万一千三百八十九个家属委员会，组织起来的家属约有一百五十一万七千九百五十七户，有四百三十八万七千九百九十七人；分散居住的职工家属绝大多数参加了街道妇代会。广大职工家属群众在几年来的各项政治运动中，逐渐提高了觉悟，改变了“老娘们不问天下大事”的思想，程度不同地树立起劳动光荣、爱厂如家的思想，把自己的家务劳动与支援自己亲人的生产结合起来，帮助自己的亲人操劳家务，做好饭菜，洗好衣服，带好孩子，让自己的亲人吃好、休息好，鼓励自己的亲人安心积极地生产劳动，不迟到，不悮工。在邻里之间普遍开展了团结互助的工作，建立起一种相互关怀的新的社会关系和社会风气，解决了许多工人家庭婚、丧、生育、疾病等困难，帮助厂矿提高了出勤率。好些基层的职工家属，依靠自己的力量把儿童组织起来，受到良好的教育，使自己能够参加文化、政治学习，提高文化、政治水平。许多职工家属积极地参加基层政权工作和当地的社会活动，响应党的号召，贯彻执行国家的政策法令，起到了基层政权的一个支柱的作用。
    旧中国给我们留下来的，是一个长期落后的农业国家，底子太穷了。要把落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，没有全国人民长期艰苦的劳动是不行的。我们职工家属，在家务劳动中，就要本着勤俭持家的精神，来支援社会主义建设。
  自己动手，克服困难
    现在摆在我们面前的困难是很多的，宿舍不够住呀，买菜要排队呀，副食品不好买呀，星期天坐车太挤呀，子女升学有困难呀，等等。但这是祖国建设事业迅速发展中带来的困难，是胜利中的困难。
    宿舍不够住怎么办呢？根据各地的经验，依靠自己的力量，还是可以有些办法的。一种办法是自己动手来盖。铁路第二工程段隧道十八中队一百二十九户家属，到了新工地许多人无房可住，家属委员会与段领导和当地人民委员会联系，利用了一块不能种地的山坡，发动家属自己买些材料，自己动手，帮助工人修建了六十多间房子，工人们给它取名叫“家属新村”。北京农业机械厂在去年雨季有四十多户房子被大风吹垮了，职工家属本着阶级友爱的精神，把那些坍了房子的职工先分别接到自己家里暂时安身，然后献出自己的劳动，和工人一起在四个星期内重新盖了四十多间房子。一种办法是职工生产流动性比较大的，在农村有家，可以回到农村参加劳动的，就尽可能地回到农村去住。还有一种办法是发扬工人阶级的友爱精神，互相调剂住宅。除此以外，可能还有别的许多办法来解决房子的问题，如自建公助或互出劳力造房子等等。自己造房子以后就可以不出租钱。自建公助的房子，过一个时期以后，也可以不出租钱了。这样，不是既解决了职工住房的问题，又不增加国家的负担吗？
    物资供应不足的困难，许多职工家属就自己动手来克服了。铁路牙林线乌尔旗汗站，1956年春组织家属种菜，到去年7月底，他们生产的各种蔬菜共有六万二千多斤，每人每天可以吃到一斤四两菜。贵州万山汞矿过去很难买到豆腐，家属自己磨；吃肉困难，家属自己养猪羊；去年中秋节，家属杀了三只一百斤以上的猪，使职工们都吃上了肉。
  最重要的是勤俭持家
    我们职工家属要响应党的增产节约、勤俭建国的号召，进一步把我们的力量和智慧贡献给社会主义事业。怎样贡献出我们的力量呢？最根本最中心的一条，就是勤俭持家。
    勤俭持家的内容是多方面的，几年来全国职工家属在这方面创造的事例是很多的。现在我随便举出一些事例来，就可以看出勤俭持家对于支援国家建设的重大作用。
    要勤俭持家，就是要精打细算地过日子。长春市爱国交通器材厂的翻砂工人钱文禄的妻子祝淑兰，是穷家出身，刷墙、砌炉灶、做衣服，都靠全家自己搞，丈夫每月领到八十四元工资都交给她，除掉生活必需的开支外，还可以有节余。几年来她一直和丈夫坚持执行着家庭生活计划，在孩子少的时候，就有不少积蓄和有计划地添置了必要用品，现在虽然一家八口，全家生活过得也很好，还在银行里存了一千四百多元。辽源和淮南煤矿的三万六千多户职工家属精打细算地过日子。几年来，一共储蓄了九十一万六千多元。
    全国绝大多数职工家属是懂得只有精打细算地过日子才能搞好家务的道理的。可是，也有少数职工和家属不大懂得这个道理。他们以为：在现在社会主义社会中，不怕失业，不愁吃穿，不用防老，不用替儿女操心，不用盖房子买地，不用留后手了。反正有了困难工会会救济，国家会帮助解决。这些想法当然是不对的。她们有一种误会，以为我们的国家既是人民的国家，就要把人民生活中一切困难都包下来，事事依靠国家解决。我们的国家是关心人民群众的生活的。国家集中力量建设社会主义，归根到底，是为了全国人民的总的利益，根本的长远的利益。国家对于人民群众当前生活中的困难，也是在尽力设法解决的。可是职工家庭生活中的困难离开了广大职工群众和职工家属自己的努力，是无论如何解决不了的。
    在社会主义建设中，粮食、煤炭、水电和棉布的供应是比较紧张的。因为工业建设的迅速发展，在这些方面就不能不发生一些困难。鹤岗煤矿七千多户职工家属五个月节省了七十五吨煤，一万多户职工家属九个月节省了四十二万二千度电，这就等于织五万公尺布所需要的电。全国二千多万工人，如果一家三口，就有六千万人，一人节约一寸布，就够做四十万套制服。家家户户都注意一针一线的节俭，对于支援建设是一种多么大的力量！
    勤俭持家，除掉要精打细算地过日子，还可以根据生产和群众的需要，根据当地条件和家属的劳动能力，因地制宜，组织多种多样的副业生产，增加家庭收入，改善家庭生活。例如墨江公路养护段全段六十九户家属，自从组织开荒种地等副业生产以后，1956年解决了长期依靠工会救济的九户职工生活困难，全段家属还清了欠款四百六十元，大人、小孩添置衣服九十六套，缝被子十三床，购买床单、蚊帐各五床，还存入银行四百多元，投入家属储金互助组一百六十九元，全段八个班，全年或半年不用买蔬菜。辽阳麻袋厂等四个单位，有一百八十七户困难户，自从家属参加副业生产后，都不用工会救济了。
    此外，组织家属进行服务性的副业生产，如缝纫、洗衣等，也都受职工的欢迎。云南第二工程公司家属生产合作社，进行了各种副业生产，得到了职工好评，他们说：“穿衣补衣有缝纫组，穿鞋补袜有针线组，衣服脏了有洗衣组，肚子饿了有副食组，要想吃菜有种菜组，要想吃肉有养猪组，需要碎石有临时工组，真好啊！”这都是依靠群众想办法的好处。
    我们职工家属和工人，应该认识家务劳动和厂矿企业中的劳动，都是建设社会主义的劳动，都是光荣的，都是应该受到尊重的。
    俗话说得好：“全家一条心，黄土变成金。”全家的团结互助是搞好家务的基本条件；也是家庭幸福的基础。解放以来，全国出现了很多幸福的新家庭。大同煤矿工人王凤梧和他的妻子封三女，两口子一起计划家庭开支，互相体贴得无微不至。王凤梧改进三百马力绞车时，遇到困难，情绪不好，封三女就鼓励他和别的同志商量办法、坚持研究，最后成功了；绞车安全运转一千八百一十五天；王凤梧五年来从未迟到早退，成了全国劳动模范。王凤梧也鼓励封三女学习和参加社会活动，并且出主意帮助她做好工作，帮助她做些较重的家务事。她们还常常和孩子们开个家庭会议，谈谈家常，启发孩子们要勤劳、团结、学习好，孩子们都成了少先队员。
    团结互助，办好集体福利事业
    职工家属当中，平常有很多困难，比如生孩子、生病和照顾孩子这些事情。从各地情况看，凡是团结互助搞得好的地方，这些困难都得到了解决。她们帮助孕妇处理家务重活，帮助产妇烧水、做饭、照顾孩子，帮助病人请大夫、上医院、照料家务，有的还为病人喂饭、输血。她们还互相协助办理婚、丧大事，或者有组织地去买菜、买粮、打煤坯，给工人送饭。家属之间的团结互助，不但可以互相帮助克服困难，而且可以减少职工对家庭的顾虑，不悮工、不缺勤，鼓舞职工更安心积极地生产。
    几年以来，在广大职工家属群众中，已经树立起团结互助的风气。根据1956年底的统计，在集中居住的职工家属中，共有三万七千九百七十二个互助组，参加的职工家属有四十五万多人。在分散居住的职工家属中，也同样开展了许多团结互助的工作。在职工家属的团结互助工作中，开展家属的储金互助工作，是很重要的。仅武汉一个市的统计，在职工家属中就有四千零五十二个储金互助组。群众说储金互助有三好：一是零钱整用对自己好；二是互助了困难户对别人好；三是存钱在银行对国家好。
    许多职工家属都积极地参加了幼儿园和托儿站的工作。根据1956年底的统计，全国集中居住的职工家属举办的托儿站、幼儿园共有一千七百七十四个，收托儿童九万一千八百三十人。在城市街道上举办的托儿站、幼儿园共收托孩子一百多万人，其中大部分是职工家属举办的。这是一种新兴的社会主义的集体福利事业。它给职工家属教养自己的子女造成了极大的便利；它也是用共产主义精神培育我们工人阶级后代的场所。我们应该十分地爱护它，扶植它，使它更多更好地发展起来。我们要求所有热心办这些事业的人，一定要像勤俭持家一样地精打细算，在所有的幼儿园和托儿站中，贯彻执行这种方针。
    许多职工家属办的幼儿园、托儿站是经过自己动手，与职工合作，克服了许多困难才办起来的。例如：鞍山共和街职工家属自己动手给幼儿园盖房，家属们拣砖、献砖、扒掉堵死的旧便所，共积累了一万多块砖，又主动地取得有关行政方面的支持，凑集了一些土木建筑材料，还请区卫生队帮助运输。四十二个职工自愿在星期日献工，九十二个家属参加了义务劳动，他们总共费了六个星期天，就盖起了五间崭新的房子。再如武昌造船厂、南昌铁路、常州戚墅堰车辆厂、抚顺老虎台矿等单位的幼儿园和托儿站，都是家属群众自己盖的房子，职工在业余时间利用废木料给幼儿园和托儿站做小桌、小凳，家属们还把家里多余的脸盆、水瓶、痰盂、玩具等东西送给或借给托儿站、幼儿园使用。
    我们一方面要很好地教养子女，同时还要注意有计划有节制地生育。在这方面，男职工应该更多地负些责任。
    子女们上学和升学的问题，是父母们最关心的。可是现在我们的国家碰到一个实际问题，就是升学的人多而国家办学的力量有限，不能使所有的学生在毕业后都继续升学。对待一时无法上学的学龄儿童，还是依靠我们自己动手想办法来组织他们学习。这就是说，一方面要把那些学龄儿童组织起来，邀请有文化的职工家属担任教员，另方面对待不能升学的儿童和青年，应该鼓励他们参加劳动；在农村有家的，尤其应该鼓励自己的子女回家去参加农业生产，在劳动中继续学习。
    几年来全国职工家属在文化学习、政治学习方面的热情很高，进步也很大。根据1956年底全国总工会和全国民主妇联的统计，在集中居住的职工家属中，经常参加文化学习的共有五十四万零八百二十六人。上海市在扫盲运动中，有三十四万职工家属参加学习，一万多职工家属担任教师。北京铁路管理局北蜂窝宿舍中的职工家属，四年来自己办了十七个文化学习班，有四百多名家属摘掉文盲帽子，有六十七名家属初小毕业，二十名高小毕业。教师完全由有文化的家属担任。许多职工家属学习的精神也是顽强的。有好多不识字的职工家属，现在已能看书、看报、写信；陈桂珍同志已由一个普通家属而成为业余作家。
  职工家属的努力方向
    ——做到“五好”
    根据国家的要求和几年来职工家属工作的经验，当前全国职工家属工作的基本任务是：教育职工家属群众提高觉悟，加强团结，贯彻“五好”，为社会主义服务。
    根据上述任务，我们要求全国职工家属努力做到“五好”：勤俭持家好；团结互助好；教养子女好；清洁卫生好；努力学习好。作到“五好”，对职工家庭来说，就是鼓励了职工生产情绪；对企业来说，就是作到了为生产服务；对我们的国家来说，就是支援了建设。
    在“五好”中，又应该以“勤俭持家好”为中心。因为勤俭持家不仅是搞好家务的要求，也是勤俭建国的要求。全国工人阶级和全国人民，都能发扬勤俭朴素的作风，都能发扬克服困难的精神来治国、持家，那么，困难就难不倒我们，我们国家的社会主义就一定可以建设好，我们家庭幸福的新生活也就一定能够建立好。
    当然，我上面说的这“五好”，只不过是对全国职工家属的一般的要求，并不限制许多职工家属在这“五好”之外的其他方面的许多工作，例如积极参加社会活动等方面的工作。各地区、各产业的情况不同，各时期的中心任务的要求也有所不同，所以在具体贯彻“五好”的时候，也可以根据当地当时的具体情况，特别是要根据家属群众的要求，因地制宜地去灵活运用。
    今后全国职工家属工作怎样做呢？
    第一、必须相信群众，依靠群众自己来做。第二、家属工作的积极分子，是热心为生产、为群众、为社会公共利益服务的积极分子，今后家属工作要开展得好，仍然要依靠广大积极分子在群众中的活动。第三、加强工会对职工家属工作的领导，特别是加强新工业区、新建厂矿的职工家属工作，充分发挥家属委员会的作用。第四、必须更好地取得党的领导，取得企业行政方面的支持。职工家属工作的干部和积极分子要采取主动，把群众的情绪、要求和意见集中起来，加以研究，提出合理可行的意见，及时地向党、向行政和基层政权方面反映，主动地请求党的指示，请求行政和基层政权方面的支持。
