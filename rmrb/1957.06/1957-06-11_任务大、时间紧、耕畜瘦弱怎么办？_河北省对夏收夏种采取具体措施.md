　　What to do when the task is large, time is tight, and the draft animals are weak?
　　Hebei Province adopts specific measures for summer harvest and summer planting
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture recently held a summer production conference to examine and improve leadership in the spirit of rectification and to deploy summer production work.
    Hebei Province’s summer harvest and summer planting area this year has increased compared to last year. The current work task is large, time is pressing, and draft animals are generally weak, with many difficulties. The conference accepted the lesson of reduced yields due to rain last year, requiring all localities to prepare for disaster prevention in advance and implement simultaneous harvesting, threshing, and distribution. The conference especially advocated changing the past practice of collective harvesting, implementing harvesting and threshing by production team and in small fields, to achieve rapid harvesting, threshing, and distribution, and avoid losses. It required all localities to learn from the lesson of mechanically emphasizing centralization and unification in last year's production organization, and in summer production work, to take the field production team as the unit, and adopt various forms to organize labor according to the type of agricultural work, improve labor efficiency and quality, and overcome the rough phenomenon in production in recent years.
    The current situation of weak draft animals in rural Hebei Province is very serious. In response to this situation, in addition to the more than 100 million jin of feed grain that has been transferred to various localities by relevant departments, the conference decided to quickly change the form of feeding and management of draft animals, persuade all collectives with poor feeding to adopt various methods of decentralized feeding; and help agricultural cooperatives complete the breeding task of 380,000 young animals this year. Rewards are given for raising breeding animals and young animals.
    In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers in summer production, the Hebei Provincial leadership, while holding the conference, successively issued many decisions: land reclamation of idle land is exempt from taxation and purchase within three years; the "three fix" policy regarding the conversion of potatoes into grain is seriously implemented; and it is proposed to thoroughly implement the regulations on issuing 5% to 10% of private plots to members, and change the practice of some agricultural cooperatives in which the private plots of members are controlled by the cooperative or team.
    Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, participated in the meeting. In his report, he pointed out that doing a good job in summer harvest, summer distribution, and summer planting is of decisive importance to easing the current grain shortage in rural areas and to striving for a good harvest this year. He called on the entire Party to do a good job in this task. In order to promote summer production work, the Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to immediately dispatch more than 200 cadres to go deep into the production teams of agricultural cooperatives in various places, strengthen specific leadership, and change the past leadership methods and styles of only listening to reports, only focusing on key points, and only paying attention to production figures, scale, and progress. It also educated the dispatched cadres to study production organization, publicize various agricultural policies, and do more political and ideological work in leading production.

　　任务大、时间紧、耕畜瘦弱怎么办？
　　河北省对夏收夏种采取具体措施
    据新华社讯  河北省农业厅最近召开夏季生产会议，以整风精神检查和改进领导，布置夏季生产工作。
    河北省今年夏收、夏种面积比去年有所增加，当前工作任务大，时间紧迫，耕畜又普遍瘦弱，困难很多。会议接受去年因雨减收的教训，要求各地提前准备防灾、实行随收随打随分。会议特别提倡改变过去集体收割的作法，分生产小组分小场收打，作到收、打、分迅速，避免损失。要求各地吸取去年生产组织机械地强调集中统一的教训，在夏季生产工作中以田间生产小组为单位，按农活种类分别采取多种形式组织劳力，提高劳动效率和质量，克服近年来生产上的粗糙现象。
    河北省当前农村耕畜瘦弱情况很严重。会议针对这一情况，除已经过有关部门调往各地一亿多斤饲料粮外，决定迅速改变耕畜喂养管理形式，说服所有集体喂养不好的社，采取各种办法分散喂养；并要帮助农业社完成今年繁殖三十八万头幼畜的配种任务。奖励喂养种畜、幼畜。
    河北省领导部门为了调动农民在夏季生产中的积极性，在召开会议的同时连续发布了许多决定：垦殖空闲地在三年内免征免购；认真执行“三定”政策关于薯类折粮的规定；并提出彻底执行发给社员5％到10％自留地的规定，改变有些农业社社员自留地由社或队掌握的办法等。
    中共河北省委第一书记林铁参加了这个会，他在报告中指出，作好夏收夏分和夏种工作对缓和当前农村粮食紧张情况，对争取今年丰收都有着决定性的作用。他号召全党要作好这项工作。省农业厅为了推动夏季生产工作，决定会后立即抽派二百多名干部，深入到各地农业社生产队，加强具体领导，改变过去只听汇报，只抓重点和只重视生产数字、规模、进度的领导方法和作风。并教育下派干部在领导生产当中要研究生产组织，宣传各项农业政策，多做政治思想工作。
