Hometown, My Hometown
	Wan Quan

As a Hankou native, for over thirty years I never felt any hometown sentiment towards Wuhan. Whenever people reminisced about the mountains, rivers, food, or customs and human feelings of their hometowns, I would feel envious and frustrated: What does my hometown have that is worth missing?

When I started remembering things, it was right after the failure of the First Great Revolution. The streets of Wuhan often echoed with the bugle calls of escorting death row prisoners. At such times, my mother would always sigh deeply: "Whose children are these again!" My mother was an ordinary housewife and did not understand the Communist Party; she had given birth to seven children, all of whom died young, and every time she saw refined and quiet young men and women being killed, she felt the pain of a loving mother. The Sixth Crossing Bridge seemed to be an execution ground specifically for intellectuals, while workers were often shot in front of the Jardine Matheson egg factory. Chiang Kai-shek's bloody suppression certainly created a white terror, but at the same time, the people of Wuhan recognized his cunning and vicious face. The people of Wuhan witnessed how Chiang Kai-shek stole the fruits of the Great Revolution and rode roughshod over the people. They are witnesses to history.

Immediately following that was the constant "running away from the bandits" during the warlord melee. At the first sign of trouble, the concessions would string up barbed wire. For fear of "currency devaluation," people would rush to buy rice. The "superior Chinese" under the protection of imperialism flocked to foreign warships anchored in the Yangtze River or hid in the foreign firms in the concessions. Ordinary people were like orphans, waiting in fear for the conscription and looting by various armies coming from the north and south.

The great flood of 1931 swallowed up countless shantytowns and impoverished countless tile-roofed houses. The September 18th Incident only left behind traces of "Ma Zhanshan Brand" cigarette advertisements. A deathly "pacification" appeared in Wuhan. Martial law, curfew. "The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in the Three Provinces of Hubei, Henan and Anhui," "The Chairman's Headquarters," "The Garrison Headquarters," these ominous yamen, fully armed guards facing the black-cloaked executioners going in and out, shouting long calls of "Attention! At ease!" My mother warned her school-going children: When passing these places, never look around; it is best to take a detour. However, detouring to the riverside or the concessions brought the terror of running into drunken foreign sailors. Around Zhongshan Road, hordes of prostitutes and secret prostitutes gathered at night; female students or housewives passing by would also be subjected to unwarranted bullying by hooligans and soldiers; innocent men passing by would be teased and kidnapped by prostitutes and madams. In the bustling shopping district, theft, fraud, and even robbery threatened people. The Yangtze River bank was relatively quiet, but even a walk under the moonlight by the river would be marred by the national shame and pain evoked by the granite buildings of imperialist blood-sucking institutions such as HSBC, Citibank, Nissin... Moreover, the relentless begging of the step-by-step beggars would not let up until they drove you away.

Life was difficult. To survive under various squeezes, exclusions, coercions, and temptations, one had to learn to protect oneself, even if it meant hurting others. Parents hoped for their children to grow up, but they also had endless worries for their children who were growing up day by day. They gave endless instructions of caution and cited various dangerous experiences to warn the young people about to leave the nest. In tender hearts, life was full of worries and fears. When people did not yet recognize the true source of all this evil, they attributed it to the thinness of human feelings and the badness of human nature in Wuhan; the "nine-headed bird" became the national stereotype, and the people of Wuhan themselves resented this place.

It was not until I participated in the revolution and left my hometown, experienced the fiery revolutionary enthusiasm, and deeply missed my relatives who remained in Hankou, that I finally developed a longing for Hankou. I went back once right after the liberation in 1949. My impression was that the city was dilapidated, and the吵闹 (chǎonào) and shouting and骂 (mà) cursing in the streets and alleys remained the same. Only the black market trading in gold and silver and speculation formed by the Kuomintang rule seemed to be new additions compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. I left without the slightest hesitation.

In 1951, I had another opportunity to pass through Hankou. This was after the democratic reform movement. The dilapidated roads had been repaired, and the most prominent feeling was that the streets and alleys were very quiet. There was much more peace between people. I met tricycle workers arguing over a traffic dispute, but I no longer heard the vicious curses that included eight generations of ancestors. The most severe condemnation was actually: "Haven't you studied? Still clinging to your old ideas!" In the cultural club park newly built on the former "golf course," there were porters in neat clothes, with coarse cloth towels draped over their shoulders, softly reciting international news from the newspaper. Wuhan was really changing. The Party was washing away the dust on the minds of the people of Wuhan, and human dignity was awakening. The gentle breeze caressed my face—still the same gentle breeze that blew on my face when I went to school in the morning. The feeling of returning home after a long absence arose spontaneously!

In 1954, Wuhan experienced the test of the floods. With the nationwide coordination and support, the entire city, men, women, old, and young, devoted themselves selflessly. Those who had witnessed the scenes of fighting the floods were amazed. The people of Wuhan, who retained painful memories of 1931, further recognized the power of their own people from this struggle and had even deeper faith in the leadership of the Party and the state. Wuhan has truly become a city of the working people—a glorious city, with the tradition of the "February 7th" strike, a city of revolutionary people who once recovered the British concession with their bare hands. For the first time, I experienced a sense of pride in my hometown, and the passion at that time could only be expressed in poetry.

When the Japanese invaders approached Wuhan in 1938, there was a song that sang: "Wuhan—the chest of your motherland, the heart of the motherland!" After that, the Kuomintang lost most of China. Its chest was trampled upon, and this heart was paralyzed in pain. Twenty years later, now that the Yangtze River Bridge has been completed and the new industrial base has been built, Wuhan has truly become the steel chest of the motherland, gloriously serving as the link between the north and south of the motherland.

Socialist new Wuhan, my hometown. I want to come back, come back to stand on the bridge, nestled against the clear sky of my hometown, and look at the rolling Yangtze River, which has been washed clean of shame and filth, with a bright future.

    家乡，我的家乡
    万全
    作为一个汉口人，三十多年我不曾对武汉有过家乡之情。每遇人们回味他们家乡的山川、饮食，或者习俗、人情的时候，我就羡慕而懊丧：我的家乡有什么值得怀念的呢？
    开始记事，正赶上第一次大革命失败。武汉的街头常常响起押解死囚的军号声。这种时刻，母亲总是深深地叹息：“这又是谁家的儿女哟！”母亲是一个普通的家庭妇女，并不了解共产党；她生养过七个孩子都夭折了，每见杀害斯文娴静的青年男女，她就感到慈母的伤痛。六渡桥似乎是专杀知识分子的刑场，工人则往往被枪毙在和记蛋厂门前。蒋介石的血腥镇压固然形成了白色恐怖，在这同时，武汉人也认清了他狡诈残毒的面貌。蒋介石当时怎样窃夺大革命的果实，骑到人民头上来的。武汉人是历史的见证。
    紧跟着就是在军阀混战中不断地“跑反”。一有风声，租界就拉上了铁丝网。因为害怕“倒票子”，人们慌张着买米。帝国主义卵翼下的“高等华人”纷纷上了舶在长江的外国兵舰，或者躲进租界的洋行里。一般人就像无依无靠的孤儿，在恐惧中等待着南来北往的各色军队的拉夫绑架和洗劫。
    1931年的大水灾吞没了多少棚户，洗贫了多少瓦房。九一八事变仅仅留下了“马占山牌”香烟广告的痕迹。武汉出现了死沉沉的“平定”。戒严、宵禁。“鄂豫皖三省剿匪司令部”、“委员长行营”、“警备司令部”这些杀气腾腾的衙门口，全副武装的卫兵迎着进进出出的披黑斗篷的屠手们，吆喝着“立正！稍息”的长声。母亲告诫上学的孩子们：走过这些地方，千万不可张望，最好是绕道而行。可是，绕到江边或者租界，又有撞上酗酒的外国水兵的恐怖。中山路一带，入夜野妓暗娼成群；女学生或主妇们走过，也会遭到流氓与军人的无端欺侮；纯良的男子走过，则又受到妓女老鸨的戏弄劫持。熙攘的商店区，偷窃诈骗甚至抢劫威胁着人。扬子江边算是比较幽静的了，偶在江干月色下走走，且不说沿江矗立的帝国主义吸血机构——汇丰、花旗、日清……等等花岗石大楼如何勾起民族耻辱心和痛苦；就是那些步步为营的乞丐底苦苦乞讨，不把你逼跑是决不放松的。
    生活艰难。在各种压榨排挤、威逼利诱下活命，就得学会保护自己，甚至顾不得是否损伤别人。父母盼望子女成长，对于一天天长大的孩子，却又有无穷尽的耽心。嘱咐不完的提防谨慎，援引种种艰险的经历，警诫将要出窠的年青人。在稚嫩的心灵中，人生充满了忧患与恐惧。当人们还不认识这一切罪恶的真正根源时，就归结到武汉这地方人情太薄、人性太坏；“九头鸟”成了全国的定评，武汉人自己也怨恨这块地方。
    直到我参加革命远离家乡，经验过烈火般的革命热情，也深深怀念着留在汉口的亲人；然而终不曾生长过对于汉口的乡思。1949年刚解放时，曾经回去一趟。印象是市容残破，街头巷尾的吵闹叫骂依旧。只有国民党统治所形成的贩卖金银、投机倒把的暗流，较之抗日战争之前，倒似是新添的东西。我没有丝毫留恋地离开了。
    1951年又有机会路过汉口，这是民主改革运动之后，残破的道路修整了，突出的感觉是街头巷尾十分宁静。人和人之间平和得多了。我遇见三轮车工人因为行车纠纷在争论，已经听不见那些殃及祖宗八代的恶骂，最重的谴责竟是一句：“你没有学习过吗？还抱着老脑筋！”在过去的“高尔夫球场”新辟建的文化俱乐部园中，有服装整洁、肩头搭着粗布长巾的搬运工人在低声诵读报纸上的国际新闻。武汉真的在变化，党洗涤着蒙在武汉人心灵上的灰尘，人的尊严在苏醒。柔和的风吹抚着，——依旧是当年清晨上学时吹到我脸上的那种小风，久别还家的心情油然而生！
    1954年武汉经历了洪水的考验。在全国配合支援下，全城男女老幼奋不顾身。曾经眼见与洪水搏斗场面的人都惊为奇迹。保有1931年痛苦记忆的武汉人，从这场斗争中更认清了人民自己的力量，对党和国家的领导更加深信。武汉已经真正成为劳动人民的城市——光荣的、有着“二七”传统、曾经徒手收复过英租界的革命人民的城市了。我第一次经历了对于家乡的自豪感，当时的激情只有用诗才能表达。
    当1938年日本侵略军逼近武汉时，曾有一首歌子唱道：“武汉——你祖国的胸膛，祖国的心脏！”在那以后，国民党断送了大半个中国，胸膛任人践踏，这颗心脏在痛苦中麻痹了。二十年后的如今，当长江大桥竣工之后，当新的工业基地建成之后，武汉真正成了祖国钢铁的胸膛，光荣地充当起祖国南北的纽带。
    社会主义的新武汉，我的家乡。我要回来，回来跨在桥上，偎依着家乡的晴空，望一望洗净了耻辱和污垢的、前程万里的滚滚长江。
