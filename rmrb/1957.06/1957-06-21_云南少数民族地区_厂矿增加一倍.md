　　Yunnan Minority Areas
　　Factories and Mines Doubled

　　Xinhua News Agency report: During the first Five-Year Plan period, more than 150 state-owned factories and mines have been built in the border minority areas of Yunnan.

　　These factories and mines are distributed in the five minority autonomous prefectures (districts) such as Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, where the industrial base was originally very weak, and the five ethnic-gathering special districts on the border, such as Lincang. In 1952, there were only 134 factories and mines in these places; now there are more than 290, an increase of more than double.

　　In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, there was not a single factory or mine at the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan. Now there are six factories that smelt iron, cast agricultural implements, and generate electricity, respectively. In the past, the agricultural tools used by farmers in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region had to be transported from the inland areas across the Red River and over the snow-capped mountains. Now, iron smelting plants or agricultural implement manufacturing plants have been established, and some agricultural tools can be manufactured locally. The prices are relatively cheap and they are in line with the habits of the local minority farmers.

　　云南少数民族地区
    厂矿增加一倍
    据新华社讯　云南边疆少数民族地区在第一个五年计划期间已经兴建了一百五十多个国营厂矿。
    这些厂矿分布在工业基础原来十分薄弱的西双版纳傣族自治州等五个少数民族自治州（区）和边疆的临沧等五个民族聚居的专区里。这些地方在1952年只有一百三十四个厂矿，现在有了二百九十多个，增加了一倍多。
    在怒江傈僳族自治州，第一个五年计划开始时没有一个厂矿，现在有六个工厂分别炼铁、铸造农具和发电。红河哈尼族自治区农民用的农具过去都由内地涉过红河，翻过雪山运去，现在办起了炼铁厂或农具制造厂，部分农具已能就地制造，价格都比较便宜，又合乎当地少数民族农民的习惯。
