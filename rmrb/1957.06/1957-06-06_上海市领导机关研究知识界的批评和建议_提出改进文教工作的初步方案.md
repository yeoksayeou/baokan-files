(Our Shanghai dispatch, June 5th) After studying the criticisms and suggestions made by Shanghai's intellectuals at recent symposiums, the Shanghai leadership has put forward preliminary plans on how to improve Shanghai's scientific work, literary and dramatic work, and higher education work. These plans have absorbed the correct opinions put forward by people from all walks of life and have proposed many measures of great significance for improving these aspects of work. These plans are now being further solicited for opinions from relevant parties in Shanghai, and some specific issues that are not significantly involved have been gradually resolved.

Regarding scientific work, the Education and Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has compiled an opinion document on several special topics in scientific work after synthesizing the opinions of scientists. This includes how to carry out research in social sciences, solve the supply of scientific equipment and books, and ensure the time for scientists to engage in professional activities.

Shanghai scientists repeatedly appealed in the symposiums that Shanghai's scientific work departments are numerous, the team is large, and the affairs are complicated. It is necessary to have a city-wide organization to coordinate and arrange the relationship between various aspects. The plan absorbed this opinion and suggested that the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee establish a Science Work Committee to undertake this task. The plan proposed to quickly carry out the rectification of books and materials. Existing libraries should improve their work on the original basis and serve scientific research; specialized forces will be organized to conduct a general survey and rescue of materials scattered in society. Regarding the production and supply of scientific equipment, the plan also proposed seven specific measures to try to meet the needs of Shanghai's scientific research units for equipment. The Science Committee will set up special groups such as books and materials, scientific equipment, and experimental animals to be responsible for planning this work.

"Too many meetings, no guarantee of time for professional activities" is also a problem that scientists and professors have the most opinions on. The plan proposes some specific measures to solve the five aspects of social part-time jobs and social activities, professional part-time jobs, administrative positions, and meetings. For example, regarding social activities, if the position held requires meetings for one or two months a year (such as deputies to the National People's Congress, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, etc.), one person must hold one position, and a few duplicates should be decided by negotiation. Many scientists and professors now hold important administrative positions, which take up a lot of time and affect scientific research and teaching work. The plan also puts forward three measures to solve this contradiction.

Regarding the improvement of the work of universities, the Party Committee and administration of Fudan University have formulated "Several Opinions on Improving the Work of Universities." The Education and Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee has distributed this plan to relevant professors in Shanghai's universities, asking them to put forward their opinions. After the opinions are collected, they will be formally submitted to the education administrative department as a reference for improving higher education work. This plan includes three parts: school administrative work, teaching work, and students' political and ideological work. Among them, it focuses on putting forward opinions on the establishment of school affairs committees and department affairs committees.

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has also put forward a principled plan for the reform of the Shanghai drama industry, which has 117 performing units and 74 theaters. Shanghai drama circles have sharply criticized the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in the leadership of drama art at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee propaganda meetings and other gatherings. The main problem is that the Party and the government have not led according to the special nature of literary and artistic work and art groups, but have adopted general administrative methods and institutionalized methods to lead and manage; the policy of "taking over" was also adopted for art groups. Although there were some objective reasons for adopting these methods in the early years of liberation, today it has hindered the development of the art industry, making some art groups have overlapping institutions, bloated personnel, and huge expenditures (from 1952 to 1956, the state subsidized old state-owned theaters more than 6 million yuan), and the artistic quality stagnated or even declined. Learning from this lesson, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture's plan proposes to change some of the old state-owned theaters from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership, and implement unified leadership and regional management, handing over the daily leadership of the theaters to the district cultural sections. In addition, some methods have also been put forward for restoring and preserving the traditional system of art units, the relationship between playwrights, directors, and performers, and the allocation of theaters.

Shanghai intellectuals criticized the publication work most for the excessive concentration of publishing houses, "one flower blooming alone," which fueled the bureaucracy and yamenization of publishing houses and canceled competition in work. The leading organs of Shanghai's publishing work accepted this criticism and have begun to formulate a plan to help restore some publishing houses that had achieved good results in the past. Those that were improperly merged during the past joint state-private ownership will be helped to re-split and set up independently. Specific opinions are now being solicited from people in the publishing industry to find suitable candidates.

Some artists have proposed that the royalty system for recording records by the Shanghai Record Factory is unreasonable and the royalties are too low. The leaders of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station have also accepted this opinion and have drafted a new draft record royalty system. According to the new method, the royalties will be increased. This draft has been sent to the relevant departments such as the State Council Broadcasting Bureau for approval.

### 上海市领导机关研究知识界的批评和建议  提出改进文教工作的初步方案

    上海市领导机关研究知识界的批评和建议
    提出改进文教工作的初步方案
    本报上海5日电　在研究了上海知识界最近各次座谈会上的批评和建议之后，上海市领导机关已经就如何改进上海的科学工作、文艺戏剧工作、高等教育工作等方面，提出了初步的方案。这些方案吸取了各界人士提出的各种正确意见，提出了许多对改进这几方面工作具有重要意义的办法。现在，这些方案正在向上海有关的各方面人士进一步征询意见，有些牵涉不大的具体问题，已在逐步解决。
    关于科学工作方面，中共上海市委教育卫生工作部综合了科学家们的意见之后，已提出了一个对科学工作方面几个专题的意见书。其中包括如何开展社会科学的研究工作，解决科学器材和图书资料的供应，保证科学家从事业务活动的时间等问题。
    上海科学家们在座谈中曾一再呼吁：上海科学工作部门多，队伍庞大，事务繁杂，很需要有一个全市性的组织来统筹安排，协调各方面的关系。方案中吸取了这个意见，建议上海市人民委员会成立一个科学工作委员会，来担负这个任务。方案中提出要迅速进行关于图书资料的整顿，已有的图书馆要在原基础上改进工作，为科学研究服务；流散在社会上的资料将组织专门力量进行普查、抢救。关于科学器材的生产和供应，方案中也提出了七条具体办法，来设法满足上海科学研究单位对器材的需要。科学委员会中将专门设立图书资料、科学器材、实验动物等小组，负责筹划这方面的工作。
    “会议太多、业务活动时间没有保障”，这也是科学家和教授们意见最多的一个问题。在方案中分别就解决社会兼职和社会活动、业务性质兼职、行政职务、会议等五个方面，提出了一些具体办法。例如关于社会活动方面，如果担任的职务一年需要开会一、二个月的人（如全国人民代表大会代表、全国政协委员等），必须一人一职，少数有重复的，用协商办法自行取舍。现在许多科学家和教授都担任了重要的行政职务，这些职务要占用不少时间，影响了科学研究和教学工作。方案中对解决这个矛盾，也提出了三条办法。
    关于改进高等学校的工作问题，复旦大学党委和行政已拟订出了一个“改进高等学校工作的几点意见”。上海市委教育卫生工作部已将这个方案分发给上海各高等学校有关教授，请他们提出意见，待意见集中后，再正式向教育行政部门提出，作为改进高等教育工作的参考。这个方案中，包括学校行政工作、教学工作、学生政治思想工作三部分。其中着重对建立校务委员会、系务委员会提出了意见。
    上海市文化局对拥有一百一十七个演出单位和七十四个剧场的上海戏剧界的改革，也提出了一个原则性的方案。上海戏剧界人士在上海市委宣传会议等历次集会上，曾对戏剧艺术领导上的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义进行了尖锐的批评，其中主要问题就是党和政府没有按照文艺工作和艺术团体的特殊性质来进行领导，而是采用了一般的行政办法、机关化的办法来领导和管理；对艺术团体也采取了“包下来”的政策。虽然，采取这些办法在解放初期的几年中有客观上的一些原因，但今天它已妨碍艺术事业的发展，使一些艺术团体机构重叠，人事臃肿，开支庞大（从1952年到1956年，国家一共给老国营剧团贴补了六百多万元），艺术质量则停滞甚至衰退。吸取这个教训，上海市文化局的方案中提出要将过去的一些老国营剧团从全民所有制改为集体所有制，并实行统一领导和分区管理，把剧团日常领导工作交给区文化科去做。另外，对于恢复和保存艺术单位的传统制度，编、导、演的关系，剧场的分配等，也都提出了一些办法。
    上海知识界对出版工作批评最多的是出版社过于集中，“一花独放”，助长了出版社的官僚习气，衙门化，取消了工作上的竞赛。上海市出版工作领导机关接受了这个批评，并已着手拟订方案，决定帮助恢复一些过去工作有成绩的出版社。过去公私合营时合并得不适当的，将帮助它重新拆开，单独设立。现在正在向出版界人士具体征询意见，物色对象。
    一些艺术家们曾提出，上海唱片厂灌制唱片的版税制度不合理，版税太低。上海人民广播电台领导上也接受了这一意见，并已拟出了一个新的唱片版税制度的草案，根据新办法，版税将有提高。这个草案已送到国务院广播事业局等有关部门审批中。
