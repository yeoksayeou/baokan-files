　　Reflections After Reading Fei Xinwo's "Grassland Picture"
　　Feng Zikai
    Brother Fei Xinwo traveled far to Inner Mongolia. Not long after his return, he brought me a long scroll of "Grassland Picture" to see. This hand scroll is five zhang long. He skillfully combined the life of the Inner Mongolian people and the scenery of northern Mongolia that he saw during his sketching trip, creating this five-zhang long hand scroll. I looked at it from beginning to end, as if I were there, and my horizons were refreshed. The ancients had the saying of "lying down to travel," and I am now "sitting down to travel" Inner Mongolia. After I finished "traveling," I immediately thought of Hulü Jin's "Chilê Song":
    "Chilê River, under the Yin Mountain. The sky is like a yurt, covering all directions. The sky is vast, the wilderness is boundless. The wind blows the grass low, and cattle and sheep are visible." I inscribed the three sentences from "The sky is vast" onwards at the end of this long scroll. When I was young, I only imagined the scene of the wilderness of northern Mongolia when I read this ancient song. Today, I saw sketches of the real scene in this "Grassland Picture," and I felt that this poem is truly a famous work, and Brother Xinwo's painting can truly capture the spirit! Otherwise, how could it make me think of the poems I read in my childhood immediately after seeing the painting?
    The long scroll, this painting format, is probably unique to China. The West has Panograma, which means "overview" or "panorama." But our long scroll seems to be different from Panograma, with a richer artistic interest. I have seen the ancient "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" and "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" before. Now I see this modern painter's "Grassland Picture," and I feel that our country's excellent art tradition is still preserved after all. After reading Brother Xinwo's "Grassland Picture," I seem to see the "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" of Inner Mongolia.
    Brother Xinwo's brushwork has his own unique characteristics: the lines are vigorous, and the brushwork is simple and clear. His lines are like calligraphy, and his brushwork is like sketching. This can also be said to be one of the excellent traditions of Chinese art. Careful appreciation reveals that it clearly contains Western-style elements; however, this Western style does not destroy the Chinese style, but complements each other, making this "Grassland Picture" represent the tendency of Chinese painting in the new era.
    I personally have a more affectionate feeling for this "Grassland Picture." Because three or four years ago, I, Qingxi, and Feng Yiyin jointly translated a "Collection of Mongolian Short Stories" written by Mongolian writers based on the Russian text. Originally, the Mongolian People's Republic and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have many things in common. I have not been to Inner Mongolia, let alone Mongolia. When translating, I only imagined the scenery of northern Mongolia based on the author's written descriptions, and I often felt it was a pity. Now, after seeing this "Grassland Picture" of Inner Mongolia, it seems to be confirmed, "Ah, so that's how it is!" There are such descriptions in the short stories:
    "... looking at the faint outline of the distant mountains, the smoke from the yurts, the grazing sheep and horses, the horsemen who slowly follow the sheep, or the horsemen who gallop at full speed and throw the lasso at the necks of the horses being watched in the herd..." (Page 59)
    "... bare cliffs. Its snow-white ridges rise into the blue sky, and the foothills are hidden in the mist of the grassland. The jagged slopes of the cliffs are exposed to the scorching sun and are so hot that even your hands cannot touch them. There is almost no vegetation, but some short grass may be found in the canyons and on the northern slopes. This place is simply impassable for vehicles. Therefore, the nomads who live in this area do not have vehicles. All heavy objects are transported by livestock..." (Page 80)
    "Blue water, green grass, white stones - all of this constitutes a beautiful pattern that can be used to decorate the clothes worn during festivals."
    (Page 81)
    Such written descriptions are now confirmed by the visual expression of the "Grassland Picture." I think: If I could have seen this "Grassland Picture" earlier, perhaps my translation would have been more vivid.

### 费新我“草原图”读后感

　　费新我“草原图”读后感
　　丰子恺
    费新我兄远游内蒙古，回来后不久，带了一幅“草原图”长卷来给我看。这手卷长凡五丈，他把此次旅行写生中所见的内蒙古人民生活及漠北风景巧妙配合，演成这五丈长的手卷。我从头至尾看了一遍，仿佛身历其境，眼界为之一新。古人有“卧游”之说，我现在正是“坐游”内蒙古。我“游”毕之后立刻想起了斛律金的“敕勒歌”：
    “敕勒川，阴山下。天似穹庐，笼盖四野。天苍苍，野茫茫。风吹草低见牛羊。”我就把“天苍苍”以下三句题在这长卷的末端了。我幼时读这古歌时，只是想像漠北旷野的光景而已。今天在这“草原图”中看到了实景的写生，觉得这诗句真是名文，而新我兄这画图真能传神！不然，怎么会使我看了画立刻想起幼时所读的诗句来呢。
    长卷这种绘画格式，恐怕是我们中国所特有的吧。西洋有Panograma，意思是“一览图”、“全景”。但我们的长卷似乎又和Panograma不同，艺术趣味更加丰富。我以前看见过古人的“长江万里图”和“清明上河图”，现在看见了这位现代画家的“草原图”，觉得我国这个美术优良传统毕竟还保存着。我读了新我兄这幅“草原图”，仿佛看到了内蒙古的“清明上河图”。
    新我兄的笔法自有他独得的特色：线条遒劲，用笔单纯明快。他的线条像书法，他的用笔像速写。这也可说是我们中国美术的优良传统之一。仔细吟味，其中显然含有西洋风成分；然而这西洋风并不破坏中国格调，却反而相得益彰，使这幅“草原图”表示了新时代中国画的倾向。
    我个人对这幅“草原图”更有一种可亲的感觉。因为三、四年前我曾经和青西及丰一吟三人根据俄文本合译蒙古作家所著的“蒙古短篇小说集”。本来蒙古人民共和国与内蒙古自治区有许多相同的地方，我没有到过内蒙古，更没有到过蒙古，翻译的时候但凭作者的文字描写而想像漠北风光，常常觉得是一种缺憾。现在看了这幅内蒙古“草原图”，仿佛得到证实，“啊，原来如此！”那短篇小说中有这样的描写：
    “……眺望远山的淡淡的轮廓、篷帐中发出的烟气、放牧的羊群、马群、缓步跟随羊群的骑马牧人、或者全速力奔驰而把轮索投到马群中被注目的马的项颈上去的骑马牧人。……”（第59页）
    “……光秃的断崖。它的白皑皑的山岭耸入青空，而山麓隐没在草原的烟雾里面。崖石峋嶙的斜面曝露在灼热的太阳底下，热得连手都不能碰。几乎没有植物，只是在峡谷里和北面的斜坡上可能找到一些矮草。这个地方车子简直无法通过。因此住在这一带的游牧者没有车辆。一切笨重的物件都由牲畜来驮运。……”（第80页）
    “青的水，绿的草，白的石头——这一切构成了美丽的图案，可以用来点缀在节日穿的服装上面。
    （第81页）
    诸如此类的文字描写，现在都被“草原图”的造形表现所证实了。我想：如果我能够早点看到这“草原图”，也许我的译笔还要生动些。
