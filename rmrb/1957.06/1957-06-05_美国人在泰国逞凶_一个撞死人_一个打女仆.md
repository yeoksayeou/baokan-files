    Xinhua News Agency, 4th, Bangkok: According to Thai newspapers, on May 30th, an American soldier killed a person in a car accident, and an employee of the American Embassy beat a Thai maid.
    The American soldier who killed the person was Staff Sergeant John Insmith, who was with the US military attache's office in Thailand. After he drove a jeep and hit a Thai man riding a motorcycle, the American soldier did not get out of the car to help the person. Instead, he drove the car straight to the US military attache's office. As a result, the Thai man died at the scene.
    The servant who was beaten by an employee of the American Embassy on the same day was a Thai girl. Because she was unwilling to work in the American's home and resigned, and asked to be paid wages, the American Embassy employee punched her, causing multiple injuries to her body.
    The Thai girl has filed a complaint with the Thai police authorities, and the Thai police authorities stated that this matter can only be "slowly dealt with."

    美国人在泰国逞凶
    一个撞死人　一个打女仆
    新华社4日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，在5月30日一天里，有一个美国军人驾车撞死人，一个美国大使馆职员殴打泰籍女仆。
    驾车撞死人的是美军上士尊·英沙密，他是美国驻泰国武官处的人员。在他驾着一辆吉普车撞倒了一个驾着机器脚踏车的泰国人以后，这个美国军人不下车救人，竟把车子一直驶到美国武官处里去，结果被撞倒的泰国人就死在现场。
    在同一天被美国大使馆职员殴打的仆人是一个泰国少女。由于她不愿意再在这个美国人的家里工作而提出辞职，并且要求发给工资，这个美国大使馆职员竟挥拳殴打她，以致她的身上被击伤多处。
    这个泰国少女已经向泰国警察当局提出控告，泰国警察当局表示，这件事只能“慢慢设法处理”。
