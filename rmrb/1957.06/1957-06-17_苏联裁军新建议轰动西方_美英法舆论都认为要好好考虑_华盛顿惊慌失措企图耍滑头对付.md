　　Soviet Disarmament New Proposal Shocks the West
    American, British and French Public Opinion Believes it Should be Seriously Considered
　　Washington Panics and Attempts to Play Tricks to Deal With It

    This newspaper comprehensive report According to a New China News Agency dispatch from New York: American newspapers have widely commented on the new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet representative at the meeting of the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Committee on the 14th.
    Many newspapers admit that the Soviet proposal to establish international supervision for the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests is of great significance. The "New York Herald Tribune" correspondent in London believes that this proposition is a "significant concession" by the Soviet Union, and it is difficult for Western countries to reject this proposal.
    The "New York Times" reporter's dispatch from London also said that the Soviet proposal is "a major step forward in drafting an agreement on preliminary measures for general disarmament."
    Walter Lippmann, a commentator for the "New York Herald Tribune," advocated that the United States should comprehensively study the Soviet proposal on the cessation of testing. He said that Khrushchev, in his interview with CBS reporters, had expressed ideas that could serve as a good starting point for negotiations.
    An editorial in the "Washington Post and Times Herald" also believed that the Soviet proposal should be given "the most careful study."
    However, American officials were clearly panicked by the Soviet Union's new peace initiative, and they did not hide their dissatisfaction with the Soviet proposal.
    Some reporters pointed out that the American delegation advocated stopping nuclear weapons testing in the short term (ten months or a year) as a counter-proposal to the Soviet proposal. "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Higgins said that some people in the United States advocate setting a ten-month deadline to ban nuclear weapons testing because the United States does not plan to conduct any large-scale new tests next year anyway. At the same time, the American plan does not stipulate stopping the manufacture of new weapons at all.

    London dispatch: The Soviet proposal has also received a good response in the British press. "The Times" believes that this proposal is worth considering. It said: "This proposal is in line with the Western point of view to some extent." "Temporarily stopping testing for two or three years would be an achievement." The newspaper also said: "Western countries should be convinced that appropriate supervision can be implemented through the Soviet Union's establishment of an international committee and supervision stations in countries producing atomic weapons and in the Pacific. The question that has not been answered is: how many atomic weapons will be produced during this suspension period. But at least the talks are proceeding seriously."
    The Labour Party newspaper "Daily Herald" published an editorial on the 15th saying, "The Soviet Union has put forward a plan to stop hydrogen bomb testing, which can serve as a preliminary measure for general disarmament." The newspaper called on the British government to seize the realistic opportunity to conclude a disarmament agreement. It believes that the British government has a "very important responsibility" to answer the Soviet proposal, and Britain should "abandon any (hydrogen bomb) tests while this issue is still under discussion."
    The "Daily Mail" reported on the Soviet proposal under the headline "The Best Disarmament News in Years Comes from the London Conference." Reuters commentator Joan Erroll said that people in the Western delegation of the Disarmament Subcommittee also believed that the Soviet proposal was "an important step."
    Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan said on the 15th that the British government "should immediately accept" the Soviet proposal put forward at the meeting of the subcommittee of the UN Disarmament Committee regarding the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Bevan said at a mass meeting of the Yorkshire miners' festival in Doncaster that the British people are more concerned than anyone about preventing atomic war, because "only six or ten hydrogen bombs are enough to wipe out Britain." He said that in order to give the people the power to decide on the issue of peace or war, nuclear weapons must be eliminated; and to do this, an "international reconciliation agreement" must be concluded. He believes that on the issue of disarmament, it is "absolutely essential to reach as many agreements as possible with the United States," but "we cannot always follow the United States." The government should take the lead in demanding that the United Nations ban hydrogen bomb testing.
　　France
    Paris dispatch: Some newspapers in Paris pointed out that the prospects for discussions in the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Committee have improved because the Soviet representative put forward a new proposal to immediately stop atomic and hydrogen weapons testing and not conduct such tests for two or three years.
    The Catholic newspaper "La Croix Soir" said: "The Soviet proposal is a step forward... The Soviet Union's new plan is close to the Western point of view on many issues, so there is hope that at least a partial agreement can be reached."
    "Le Monde" also made a similar evaluation of the Soviet proposal. The newspaper said: "The proposal put forward by the Soviet representative in London regarding the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing and the establishment of monitoring posts to check the implementation of this measure is undoubtedly a step forward."

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯纽约消息：美国报纸广泛评论苏联代表14日在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议上提出的裁军新建议。
    许多报纸承认，苏联提出的就暂时停止原子武器和氢武器试验建立国际监督的建议是有重大意义的。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻伦敦记者认为，这个主张是苏联“有着重大意义的一个让步”，西方国家要拒绝这个建议是很困难的。
    “纽约时报”记者发自伦敦的报道也说，苏联的建议是“在草拟规定普遍裁军的初步措施的协定方面前进了一大步”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼主张美国应当全面研究苏联关于停止试验的建议。他说，赫鲁晓夫在向电视广播公司记者发表谈话时，已经表示了可以作为谈判的良好开端的主意。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”的社论也认为对苏联的建议应当进行“最仔细的研究”。
    但是，美国官方人士显然被苏联的新的和平倡议弄得惊慌失措了，他们没有掩盖自己对苏联建议的不满情绪。
    有些记者指出，美国代表团主张在短期内（十个月或者是一年）停止核武器试验，作为对苏联的建议的一个反建议。“纽约先驱论坛报”记者希金斯说，美国一些人士所以主张规定十个月的期限来禁止核武器试验，是因为反正美国不打算在明年进行任何大规模的新试验。同时，美国的计划也丝毫没有规定要停止制造新武器。
　　英
    伦敦消息：苏联的建议在英国报界同样获得良好的反应。“泰晤士报”认为这个建议是值得考虑的。它说：“这个建议在某种程度上符合西方的观点”。“暂时停止试验两三年，这将是一项成就”。这家报纸还说：“西方国家应该确信：通过苏联关于成立国际委员会和在各生产原子武器的国家和太平洋设立监督站，是可以实行适当的监督的。还没有回答的问题是：在这个暂停期间内还会生产多少原子武器。但是至少会谈是在认真地进行着。”
    工党报纸“每日先驱报”15日发表社论说，“苏联提出了可以作为普遍裁军的初步措施的停止氢弹试验的计划。”这家报纸要求英国政府抓住缔结裁军协定的现实机会。它认为英国政府负有“非常重大的责任”来回答苏联的建议，英国应该“在这个问题还在讨论中的时候就放弃任何（氢弹）试验。”
    “每日邮报”在“伦敦会议传来多年来最好的裁军消息”的标题下报道了苏联的建议。路透社评论员琼·埃鲁尔说，裁军小组委员会中的西方代表团的人士也认为，苏联的建议是“重要的一步”。
    工党左翼领袖比万15日说，英国政府“应当立即接受”苏联在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出的关于立即停止试验核武器的建议。比万在敦卡斯特举行的约克郡矿工节群众大会上说，英国人比任何人都要关心防止原子战争的问题，因为“只用六个或者十个氢弹就足以消灭英国。”他说，要使人民对和平或者战争的问题有决定权，就必须消灭核武器；而要作到这一点就必须缔结一个“国际和解的协定”。他认为，在裁军问题上英国“同美国达成尽可能多的协议是绝对不可少的”，但是“不能老是追随美国”。要政府率先要求联合国禁止氢弹试验。
　　法
    巴黎消息：巴黎一些报纸指出，由于苏联代表提出了立刻停止原子武器和氢武器试验并且在两三年内不进行这种试验的新建议，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的讨论前景有了好转。
    天主教报纸“十字架晚报”说：“苏联建议是一个前进的步骤……苏联的新方案在很多问题上接近西方的观点，所以出现了至少能够达成局部协议的希望。”
    “世界报”也对苏联建议作了类似的评价。这家报纸说：“苏联代表在伦敦提出的关于暂时停止试验原子武器和氢武器及建立检查这一措施实施情况的监督哨的建议，无疑是前进了一步。
