I Object to Ge Peiqi's Views
To the Editor:
    I have read Ge Peiqi's speech at the symposium at the Renmin University of China, which was published on page 7 of the People's Daily on May 31st. I firmly oppose his views. I am writing down some of my opinions below. I would like to add here that I very much hope that the People's Daily will publish my views. If my views are published in the newspaper, I hope that no one will misunderstand that the People's Daily is "collecting" them. I also support "letting go," but I oppose the attitude of only allowing oneself to "speak up" while being unwilling to listen to others' differing opinions, and even labeling differing opinions with the cap of "passive怠工之意."

    The following are my opinions on some of Ge Peiqi's views:

    "State monopoly for purchase and marketing has messed things up." If China were to take the capitalist road, this would be correct. However, China's road will not obey the subjective wishes of some people. China can only and must take the socialist road. If China is to take the socialist road, then the state monopoly for purchase and marketing is not messed up, but is doing very well. Because the state monopoly for purchase and marketing has severed the ties between urban and rural capitalism, blocked the spontaneous capitalist trend of the small-peasant economy, stabilized prices, and also made it possible for the tens of millions of farmers in disaster areas each year to not starve to death with the help of the state under the current conditions. Isn't this very good? It should be said that it is too good, so good that it can even be said that the state monopoly for purchase and marketing has brought us socialism. "Tight supply of materials," yes, the supply of certain materials is indeed tight, but this is not because "the state monopoly for purchase and marketing has messed things up." Taking the tight supply of pork as an example, the reasons are also multifaceted. If this is also related to the state monopoly for purchase and marketing, it is only due to a lack of experience in implementing this policy. The fundamental reason for the "tight supply of materials" is not that "the state monopoly for purchase and marketing has messed things up." The state monopoly for purchase and marketing is not bad, but very good. The fundamental reason for the tight supply of materials lies in the low productivity, in the contradiction between the backward agricultural country status of our country and the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country, which has not been resolved.

    "The anti-rightist movement has messed things up." No, the anti-rightist movement is doing so well! What's wrong with purging a group of hidden counter-revolutionaries? Only those who hope for the restoration of the counter-revolution will oppose the anti-rightist movement. The people will never oppose the anti-rightist movement. The people cheer for the victory of the anti-rightist movement. Are there any deviations in the anti-rightist movement? Yes, but the people do not oppose the anti-rightist movement because of this. The people's hope is that the anti-rightist movement will be carried out as thoroughly as possible, and that even a single counter-revolutionary element will be uprooted. In fact, the people's wish is very natural. The people feel the greatest threat from counter-revolutionary elements; and those who are "of two minds" about the Communist Party, who share the fate of the people, and about our great socialist motherland will not feel any threat. "The anti-rightist movement has messed things up" is not the people's view of the anti-rightist movement. The people's view is that the anti-rightist movement is very good.

    "Who has improved their living standards? Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes but now sit in small cars and wear woolen uniforms." This sentence is sharp enough. It is quite stimulating to speak sharply, and I do not object to it. What I oppose is replacing the whole with the partial, and replacing the whole with the part. Is it only those "Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes but now sit in small cars and wear woolen uniforms" whose living standards have improved today? Have the living standards of workers improved? Have the living standards of the vast majority of farmers improved? Has the living situation of the numerous professionals and unemployed intellectuals in old China whose occupations were not guaranteed changed? "Speaking honestly," very good, but you can first ask your own "conscience" whether what you are saying is "honest words"? If it is "honest words," then it seems to me that that heart is not a "conscience." If you do not mean to say that, but mean to say that the living standards of some Party members and cadres have improved too quickly, I agree, because this is in line with the facts, and I also agree with opposing this phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. It is very good to help the Communist Party rectify its work style, and although I am not a Communist Party member, I will also actively and seriously help the Party rectify its work style. But if you want to truly help the Party, I think you should adopt a pragmatic attitude.

    "Party members have played the role of plainclothes police monitoring the masses." If some Party members report situations of some of the masses to the Party organization in a way that is not comprehensive enough, and even mixed with their own impure motives, this situation does exist. Because they have violated the Party's principles, they do not have enough sense of responsibility to the Party and the masses, and some people even have a bad ideological style. These things should be opposed. However, it cannot be said that it is wrong for Party members to report situations of the masses to the Party organization. If the report is truthful and does not involve their own impure motives, this kind of report can enable the Party organization to understand the situation of the masses more and thus better lead the masses in their work and better help the masses to make progress. What's wrong with that? Putting an irrelevant hat on Party members is not helpful to helping the Party rectify its work style.

    "China is China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries, not the China of the Communist Party." I think China is indeed China of 600 million people, and the Communist Party is also included in the 600 million people. But the People's China is not the China of counter-revolutionaries. The "China" of counter-revolutionaries is not the China of the people. If counter-revolutionary elements also become the masters of the country, the people will become slaves.

    "If the Communist Party is destroyed, China will not be destroyed." "Even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will not sell out the country." I don't think the Communist Party can be destroyed, because it has done many good things for the people. "State monopoly for purchase and marketing" is one, and the "anti-rightist movement" is two. The people can't finish saying the good things about the Communist Party. This is the Communist Party in the eyes of the people. The people also criticize the Communist Party's mistakes and shortcomings, but the people do not hope that the Communist Party will be "destroyed" because the Communist Party has made some mistakes and shortcomings. Those who want the Communist Party to be "destroyed" are those past landlords and rich peasants, and those counter-revolutionary elements who are still lurking and have not been purged. The people's feeling is that the Communist Party is connected to them by flesh and blood and shares their breath. "China will not be destroyed," of course. But this is first of all because the People's China is the China led by the Communist Party, because the Communist Party tightly unites the 600 million people, and because the Communist Party has taught the people how to oppose the enemies of their country. "Even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will not sell out the country." It depends on what kind of person it is. If a person has no conscience, I think he will sell out the country in a different environment. Isn't Chiang Kai-shek, who is still relying on American imperialism and hiding in Taiwan, this kind of person? Historically, weren't there many traitors?

    Finally, as a non-Party cadre, I would like to offer a point of view on helping the Party to rectify its work style. I think it is good for non-Party members to help the Party rectify its work style. There are indeed many shortcomings in the ideological style of many Party members. If there were no shortcomings, why would there be a rectification? The Party's rectification and the welcoming of non-Party members to participate show that the Party is striving to correct its shortcomings and to better correct its shortcomings. Non-Party members should enthusiastically and seriously help the Party rectify its work style. If non-Party members want to truly play a good role in the rectification movement, in my opinion, first, they must have a correct stand, that is, to proceed from the interests of the 600 million people; second, they must have a correct attitude. Killing with one blow is not the solution. Trying to kill the Communist Party with one blow is impossible, because the people will not allow it.

### 我反对葛佩琦的观点
傅随贤

第7版()
专栏：读者来信

    我反对葛佩琦的观点编辑同志：
    我读了5月31日人民日报第七版刊载的葛佩琦在中国人民大学座谈会上的发言。我坚决反对他的观点。现在把我的一些意见写在下面。在这里附带说明一下，我很希望人民日报能够发表我的意见，如果我的这些意见在报上发表了的话，我希望不要有人又误会人民日报是在“收”了。我也拥护“放”，但是我反对那种只许自己“鸣”，不愿听别人的不同意见，甚至对不同的意见扣上一顶“消极怠工之意”的帽子的态度。
    以下就是我对于葛佩琦的一些观点的意见：
    “统购统销搞糟了”。如果说中国要走资本主义道路的话，这句话一点也不错。可是，中国的道路并不会服从一些人的主观愿望。中国只有走也只能走社会主义的道路。中国要走社会主义的道路，那末统购统销不是搞糟了，而是搞得很好。由于实行统购统销便割断了城乡资本主义的联系，阻塞了小农经济自发的资本主义的趋向，稳定了物价，也使得在目前条件下每年必然会有的几千万的灾区的农民能够有可能在国家的帮助下不至于饿死。这岂不是好得很？应该说是太好了，好到甚至可以这么说，统购统销给我们带来了社会主义。“物资供应紧张”，对，某些物资供应的确紧张，但这并不是由于“统购统销搞糟了”。即以猪肉供应紧张而论，原因也是多方面的，如果说这也与统购统销有联系的话，那也只是由于执行这个政策缺乏经验。“物资供应紧张”的根本原因不在于“统购统销搞糟了”，统购统销并不糟，而是好得很。物资紧张的根本原因是在于生产力的低下，是在于我国落后的农业国的现状和人民对建立先进的工业国的要求的矛盾没有得到解决。
    “肃反运动搞糟了”。不是的，肃反运动搞得太好了！肃清了一批暗藏的反革命分子有什么不好？只有希望反革命复辟的人才会反对肃反运动。人民决不反对肃反运动，人民欢呼肃反运动的胜利。肃反运动中有没有偏差？有，但是人民并不因此就反对肃反运动，人民的希望是肃反运动搞得越彻底越好，最好连一个反革命分子都连根拔掉。其实，人民这种愿望是很自然的，对于反革命分子感到最大的威胁的是人民；而那些对与人民共命运的共产党、对我们伟大的社会主义祖国“三心二意”的人，是不会感到什么威胁的。“肃反运动搞糟了”不是人民对肃反运动的看法，人民的看法是肃反运动好得很。
    “生活水平提高的是哪些人呢？过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部”。这句话是够尖锐了。话说得尖锐些颇能起些刺激作用，我并不反对。我所反对的只是以片面代替全面，以部分代替整体。难道今天生活水平提高的只是那些“过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部”吗？工人的生活提高了没有？绝大多数的农民的生活提高了没有？在旧中国为数众多的职业没有保障的和失业的知识分子的生活状况改变了没有？“说良心话”，很好，但是可以先问问自己那一颗“良心”，说的是否就是“良心话”？如果是“良心话”的话，依我看那一颗心并不是“良心”。如果说，话不是那么说，而是说有一部分党员和干部生活水平提高得太快了，我赞成，因为这合乎事实，我也赞成反对这种脱离群众的现象。帮助共产党整风，很好，我也并非共产党员，我也要积极地、严肃认真地帮助党整风。但是如果要想真正对党有些帮助，我看自己就应该采取实事求是的态度。
    “党员起了监视群众的便衣警察的作用”。如果说有一些党员向党组织反映某个群众的情况不够全面，甚至夹杂自己的不纯的动机，这种情况是有的。由于他违反了党的原则，对党、对群众责任感不够，甚至有些人思想作风恶劣，对于这些，是应该反对的。但是不能说党员向党组织反映群众的情况这件事是不对的，如果如实的反映，并不夹杂自己的不纯的动机，这种反映就能够使党组织更多地了解群众的情况，从而更好地领导群众进行工作，更好地帮助群众进步，这有什么不好？替党员扣上一顶不伦不类的帽子，对帮助党整风是没有好处的。
    “中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内，不是共产党的中国”。我看中国的确是六亿人民的中国，共产党也包括在六亿人民之内。但是人民中国并不是反革命分子的中国，反革命分子的“中国”，不是人民的中国。如果反革命分子也成了国家的主人翁，人民就变成了奴隶了。
    “共产党亡了，中国不会亡”。“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”。我看共产党亡不了，因为它为人民做了许多好事。“统购统销”一也，“肃反运动”二也，人民说共产党的好处说不完，这是人民眼里的共产党。人民也批评共产党的错误和缺点，但是人民并不因为共产党有了一些错误和缺点而希望共产党“亡了”。愿意共产党“亡了”的，是那一些过去的地主、富农，是那一些还在潜伏而没有被肃清的反革命分子。人民的感觉是：共产党是和自己血肉相连、呼吸与共的。“中国不会亡”，当然。但是这首先是因为人民的中国是共产党领导的中国，是因为共产党把六亿人民紧紧地团结在一起，是因为共产党教会了人民怎样去反对自己的国家的敌人。“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”。这要看是怎样的人，如果没有良心的人，换了一个环境，我看他也是会卖国的。现在还依附美帝国主义躲在台湾的蒋介石不正是这种人吗？从历史来看，卖国贼不也是不少吗？
    最后，我作为一个非党干部提一点对于帮助党整风的意见。我认为非党人士帮助党整风是好的。许多党员的思想作风的确有很多缺点，如果没有缺点又何必整风？党进行整风，而且欢迎党外人士参加，这正表明党要努力改正自己的缺点，和要更好地改正自己的缺点。党外人士应该热诚地、严肃认真地帮助党整风。党外人士在整风运动中要想自己真正起一些好的作用，照我看来，第一，要有一个正确的立场，这就是要从六亿人民的利益出发；第二，要有正确的态度。一棍子打死，不是办法。要想一棍子打死共产党办不到，因为人民不答应。
