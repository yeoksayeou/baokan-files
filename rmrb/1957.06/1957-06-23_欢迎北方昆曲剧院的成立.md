　　Welcoming the Establishment of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater

    In these days of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the establishment of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater is a very gratifying event for the theater community, and I am very excited.

    Since Mr. Wei Liangfu created the Kunqu style, the two hundred years from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty were the prosperous and flourishing period of Kunqu Opera. By the time I came on stage to perform, it had already declined. I believe that the characteristics of Kunqu Opera are numerous and varied, and its lyrics and performances are all rich and colorful. At that time, I had a desire to save this traditional, excellent, and dying opera genre. Then, I should start by learning and performing Kunqu Opera. I learned dozens of Kunqu Operas, and often presented "Thinking of the Mortal World," "Water Battle," "Broken Bridge," "School Disturbance," "Garden Stroll," "Dream Interruption," "Good Time," "Torturing Hong," "Teasing with the Zither," "Asking About Illness," "Stealing Poems," "Dressing Up," "Kneeling by the Pond," "Jade Terrace," "Hiding the Boat," "Assassinating the Tiger," "Misunderstanding of the Kite," and "The Golden Sparrow Record" to the audience. Later, the ancient costume dramas such as "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" and "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" that I compiled also adopted the prominent singing and dancing performances of Kunqu Opera, and I received a lot of help from it. In the past, many successful Peking Opera masters, such as Cheng Changgeng, Xu Xiaoxiang, Tan Xinpei, Wang Lengxian, Chen Delin, Yang Xiaolou, and even my grandfather, Mei Qiaoling, all had a foundation in Kunqu Opera, so they performed Peking Opera even more outstandingly. My skills are far inferior to these old gentlemen, but my emphasis on and love for Kunqu Opera has always been consistent.

    Back then, those who performed Kunqu Opera in Beijing at the same time as me included many gentlemen such as Tao Xianting, Chen Ronghui, Hao Zhenji, Hou Yilong, Wang Yiyou, Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, Bai Yutian, and Hou Yushan. Although we did not perform in the same place, we competed with each other in a lively manner for a while. After a few years, Kunqu Opera was still deserted. Until now, most of the gentlemen mentioned above have passed away, leaving only a few surviving like Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng, who still hold the mentality of preserving the past and waiting for the future, and are willing to contribute their strength to the vast people of New China. However, due to insufficient attention and help from all sides, and their own inability to clap with one hand, they often feel that they have no opportunity to use their talents. How can this not be regrettable?

    Now, the central cultural leaders and the literary and art circles have come to support them, to let them bring out everyone's skills to cultivate the next generation, so that the traditional art that is on the verge of extinction can not only be preserved, but also be developed. I express my full support for this matter, and express my warm welcome!

    I believe that with the dedicated teaching of these gentlemen and the enthusiastic support from all sides, countless new talents will be cultivated, and the Kunqu Opera career in the North will be vigorously revived from now on.

　　欢迎北方昆曲剧院的成立
　　梅兰芳
    在今天“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的日子里，北方昆曲剧院成立了，这对戏剧界说来，是一件十分可喜的事情，我感到非常兴奋。
    自从魏良辅先生创造昆腔以来，由明嘉靖到清乾隆这二百多年当中，是昆剧繁荣而鼎盛的时期，等到我登台演戏的时候，它已经衰落了。我认为昆剧的特点是不一而足的，它的唱词、表演全都是丰富多采的。当时我有一个志愿，想把这传统优良而气息奄奄的剧种挽救一下，那末，就应该先从学习昆剧、演唱昆剧做起。我学会了几十出昆剧，时常把思凡、水斗、断桥、闹学、游园、惊梦、佳期、拷红、琴挑、问病、偷诗、梳妆、跪池、瑶台、藏舟、刺虎和风筝误、金雀记这些戏跟观众见面。后来我所编的嫦娥奔月、天女散花等古装戏，还采用了昆剧载歌载舞的突出表演，我得到它不少的帮助。过去许多成功的京剧名宿如程长庚、徐小香、谭鑫培、王楞仙、陈德霖、杨小楼诸位老先生，连我祖父梅巧玲先生，他们都是有了昆剧的基础，所以把京剧演得更为杰出。我的功夫比起这几位老先生差得远了，但是对于昆剧的重视和热爱是始终如一的。
    当年和我同时在北京演出昆剧的，还有陶显庭、陈荣惠、郝振基、侯益隆、王益友、韩世昌、白云生、白玉田、侯玉山等许多位先生。我们大家虽然不在一处演戏，却是以争鸣竞赛的姿态，热闹过一阵。过了几年，昆剧仍然冷落了。直到现在，上面所谈的诸位先生多数已经作古，剩下了硕果仅存的像韩世昌、白云生等几位先生，他们都还抱着守先待后的心情，愿意为新中国广大人民贡献出力量，但由于各方面的重视和帮助不够，自己又孤掌难鸣，因而常常感觉到英雄无用武之地。这样，哪能不令人扼腕呢？
    好了，今天中央文化领导方面和文艺界都来支援他们了，要让他们拿出每个人的本领来培养下一代，使不绝如缕的传统艺术非但能够保存，并且还得发展下去。我对这件事表示完全拥护，表示热烈欢迎！
    我相信，有这几位先生的尽心传授和各方面的热情支持，一定会造就出无数新的人才，北方的昆剧事业从此蔚然复兴。
