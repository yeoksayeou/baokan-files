    "Political Fanatics" and "Lofty Hermits"
    Fan Laisu
    In our real life, there are two kinds of people like this.
    One kind of person: When eating peanuts, they talk grandly about the great truth that labor creates the world; while strolling in the park, they insist on holding self-criticism meetings; when they first fall in love, they ask their partner to give them suggestions; they don't hesitate to criticize even newly acquainted friends for wasting money on cigarettes...
    Another kind of person: Seeing others getting close to the organization, they think they are bootlicking; seeing others taking the lead in work, they mock it as "going with the flow"; theoretical books are too boring, they don't want to read them; they think big reports are not exciting, they don't want to listen to them; when current affairs and politics are mentioned, they feel it is vulgar and unbearable, and they are unhappy from the bottom of their hearts. ...
    The former are "political fanatics," seemingly walking ahead of the times, but actually too far away from the masses; lacking human touch, people respect them but keep them at a distance; although they have good intentions, they cannot accomplish good things. The latter are "lofty hermits," thinking they are aloof from the world, appreciating themselves in solitude, but actually lagging behind the progress of the times; with a strange temper, people also respect them but keep them at a distance; although they don't do anything bad, they play a negative role.
    These two kinds of people cannot stand each other. The latter think the former are "pretending to be active," and the former think the latter are "willing to lag behind." The distance becomes greater and greater, and the aversion becomes deeper and deeper.
    As the ancients said: Too much is as bad as too little. Both sides should think twice!

    “政治迷”与“清高鬼”
    范来苏
    在我们现实生活中，有着这样两种人。
    一种人：当吃花生米的时候，高谈劳动创造世界的大道理；在逛公园的当儿，偏要召开检讨会；初次谈恋爱，便要求对象给他提意见；那怕新结识的朋友也能不揣冒昧，批评人家抽香烟太浪费……
    另一种人：看到别人靠拢组织，就认为是拍马屁；看到别人工作带头，便嘲笑为“一窝蜂”；理论书太枯燥，不愿看；认为大报告不精彩，不愿听；一提时事政治，便是庸俗不堪，从心底眼里不高兴。……
    前者是“政治迷”，似乎走在时代的前面，实际上离开群众太远；缺乏人情味，人便敬而远之，虽有好心，办不出好事来。后者是“清高鬼”，自以为拔世脱俗，孤芳自赏，实际上赶不上时代的进步；性情乖僻，人也敬而远之，虽不做什么坏事，却起着消极的作用。
    这两种人，谁也看不惯谁，后者认为前者是“伪装积极”，前者认为后者是“自甘落后”，距离越来越大，反感越来越深。
    古人说得好：过犹不及。双方都应三思！
