Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 15th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru flew to London this morning after a fifteen-hour official visit to Damascus, the capital of Syria.

During his visit to Damascus on the 14th, he held a ninety-minute meeting with Syrian President Kuwatly, Prime Minister Asali, and Foreign Minister Bitar, accepted the title of citizen of Damascus, and attended a state banquet hosted by Kuwatly in his honor.

Speaking at the ceremony where he accepted the title of citizen of Damascus, Nehru called for "better and broader" observance of the Bandung Conference resolutions to serve the cause of world peace. He said, "If the world adopts the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as formulated by the Bandung Conference, it will be a major step forward towards peace." He proposed that the principles of the Bandung Conference must become the basis of any international order.

Nehru believes that Asian countries should use methods based on peace and the human spirit to deal with "the challenge of the hydrogen bomb" because the human spirit is something more powerful than the hydrogen bomb.

Speaking at the state banquet, Nehru said that he believed that the people of Asia would certainly be able to realize their determination in accordance with the Bandung principles. He also said, "But we regret that some of the participating countries in that conference have forgotten these principles so quickly and acted in the opposite direction."

    尼赫鲁访问叙利亚
    呼吁各国遵守万隆原则 
    据新华社15日讯　大马士革消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在叙利亚首都大马士革作十五小时的正式访问后，今天上午乘飞机前往伦敦。
    他在14日到达大马士革访问期间，曾经同叙利亚总统库阿特利、总理阿萨利、外交部长比塔尔举行了九十分钟的会谈，接受了大马士革公民的称号，并且出席了库阿特利为他举行的国宴。
    尼赫鲁在接受大马士革公民称号的仪式上讲话时，要求“更好地和更广泛地”遵守万隆会议的决议，来为世界和平事业服务。他说，“如果世界采纳万隆会议所制定的一国不干涉他国事务的原则，这就是向和平前进了一大步”。他提出，万隆会议的原则必须成为任何国际秩序的基础。
    尼赫鲁认为，亚洲国家应该用以和平和人类精神为基础的方法去对付“氢弹的挑战”。因为人类的精神是比氢弹更加强大的东西。
    尼赫鲁在国宴上讲话时说，他相信，亚洲人民一定可以根据万隆原则实现他们的决心。他又说，“但是我们感到遗憾的是，那个会议的某些参加国那么快就忘掉这些原则，在行动上背道而驰。”
