Regarding "Beating Bureaucracy to Death With One Blow"
    Ā Mù
    When evaluating people and events, if we ignore the specific time, space, and other conditions, and if we do not examine the ins and outs of things from the specific social environment, then we will inevitably make incorrect judgments. If we rely on this to determine our attitude towards things and our way of handling things, then things will be terrible. After reading Mr. Hu Mingshu's article "What's Wrong With Being Able to Beat Bureaucracy to Death With One Blow?" in the May 28th "Wenhui Daily," I had this feeling.
    I am not clear about the truth of the "ruthless trampling of historical relics by bureaucracy" involved in this short article, so I have no right to speak; but I have doubts about the argument that today's bureaucracy can be "beaten to death with one blow." The author, based on the principle that we should have different attitudes towards people and things, believes that "we should treat and save comrades who have committed bureaucracy, but we should thoroughly overthrow and hate bureaucracy!" So "what's wrong with whoever has the ability to beat bureaucracy to death with one blow?" It seems to make a lot of sense. Since we want to thoroughly overthrow it and hate it to death, why can't we "beat it to death with one blow?" But on closer inspection, the problem is not so simple.
    The trouble is that while beating bureaucracy to death with one blow, "we should treat and save comrades who have committed bureaucracy." There is a difference and a connection between bureaucracy and comrades who have committed bureaucracy; the former is the latter's "illness." Is "one blow" effective in killing the former in order to save the latter? Even if a "one-blow" type of drastic medicine can really kill all the germs at once, can the sick body withstand it? Moreover, today's bureaucratic disease is a chronic ideological disease. Can it be beaten to death with one blow?
    What is important is the first few sentences of this article. When evaluating people and events, we must always consider the specific circumstances of time and space, and we should not think that as long as we grasp the general principles, we can solve any practical problem. Is there no difference between today's bureaucracy and the bureaucracy of the old society? In the old society, the root of bureaucracy lay in the economic and political system of the time, and in the nature of the exploiting class. The reactionary ruling class could not but become a stronghold of bureaucracy divorced from the people. If we did not overthrow the economic and political system of the time, did not smash the bureaucratic organs, and did not "beat to death" bureaucrats economically and politically, it would not be possible to "beat to death" bureaucracy. Reasoning with them is often like playing the lute to a cow, "treating and saving" is a joke, and the method of "beating to death with one blow" is applicable.
    However, today's bureaucracy is not the inevitable product of today's social system, but rather the legacy of the old society and the old system. It is fundamentally incompatible with our socialist system. Precisely because of this, we must "hate it to death" and "thoroughly overthrow it"; and precisely because of this, we must pay attention to the method of "beating" in order to achieve the goal of beating bureaucracy to death and saving "comrades who have committed bureaucracy." Is it better to use a simple and crude blow, or repeated reasoning and gradual disinfection through criticism and self-criticism? This should be easy to answer.
    Therefore, even if "we have the ability," I don't think we need to adopt the method of "beating to death with one blow."

### 关于“一棍子打死官僚主义”

    关于“一棍子打死官僚主义”
    阿木
    看人论事，如果忽视了具体的时间、空间和其他条件，如果不从具体的社会环境中考察事物的来龙去脉，那就难免要作出不正确的论断。如果据此以确定自己对待事物的态度和处理事物的方法，那就糟了。我读了5月28日“文汇报”上胡明树先生的“能一棍子打死官僚主义，又有何不可？”一文，便有此感。
    这篇短文所牵涉的“官僚主义对历史文物的无情践踏”的真相如何，我不清楚，没有发言权；但对今天的官僚主义可以“一棍子打死”的论点，却有疑问。作者根据对人对事应有不同态度的原则，认为“对犯了官僚主义的同志我们要治病救人，而对官僚主义则要彻底地打倒它，恨死它！”所以“谁有本领一棍子打死官僚主义，又有何不可？”看来似乎说得很有道理。既然要彻底地打倒它，恨死它，为什么不可以“一棍子打死”它呢？可是仔细一想，问题并不如此简单。
    麻烦的是：在一棍子打死官僚主义的同时，“对犯了官僚主义的同志我们要治病救人”。官僚主义和犯了官僚主义的同志之间有区别，也有联系，前者就是后者的“病”。打死前者，为了救活后者，那“一棍子”行吗？即使一服“一棍子”式的猛药真能一下子杀死所有的病菌，那病体受得住吗？何况今天的官僚主义病是一种慢性的思想病，一棍子打得死吗？
    重要的是本文开头的几句话。看人论事，总得根据时间、空间等具体情况，不要以为只要抓住一般性原则，便能解决任何实际问题。难道今天的官僚主义跟旧社会的官僚主义没有什么不同吗？在旧社会，官僚主义的根源在于当时的经济、政治制度，在于剥削阶级的本质。反动的统治阶级不可能不成为脱离人民的官僚主义的大本营。如果不推翻当时的经济、政治制度，不打碎官僚主义机构，不从经济、政治上“打死”官僚主义者，就不可能“打死”官僚主义。对他们说理往往是对牛弹琴，“治病救人”是笑话，而“一棍子打死”的办法倒是适用的。
    可是今天的官僚主义不是今天社会制度的必然产物，而是旧社会、旧制度的遗毒。它跟我们的社会主义制度根本不相容。正因为如此，我们要“恨死它”，“彻底地打倒它”；也正因为如此，我们必须讲究“打”的方法，以达到打死官僚主义又救活“犯了官僚主义的同志”的目的。是简单粗暴的一棍子好呢，还是反复说理、逐渐消毒的批评和自我批评好？这应该是容易回答的。
    所以，即使“有本领”，我看也不必采取“一棍子打死”的办法。
