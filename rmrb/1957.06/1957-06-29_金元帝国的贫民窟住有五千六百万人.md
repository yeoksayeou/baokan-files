　　金元帝国的贫民窟住有五千六百万人
    新华社莫斯科28日电　莫斯科“苏维埃俄罗斯报”27日报道，在美国每五户人家中就有一户每年的收入低于两千美元，而根据官方公布的生活指数，美国四口之家每年最低的生活费用是四千四百七十二块美元。在这方面，报纸还引证最近艾森豪威尔总统给国会的关于国家经济情况的咨文，其中谈到美国五千二百二十万户家庭中，有两千一百六十万户每年收入少于四千美元。
    根据去年的资料，美国工人家庭的房租（包括公用设备费）每年最低要支出六百七十七美元。如果这样的家庭有两千美元的收入，那么房租就占了整个家庭收入的33.8％。据官方统计，美国目前有五千六百万人住在贫民窟里。
    在美国，医疗费非常高。如果一个美国人生了病进了普通医院，他每天就得花十七美元。在美国，有四分之一的家庭付不起这样昂贵的医疗费。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”写道，美国有几百万户家庭每年的收入还远远低于两千美元。这包括零售店员、林业工人、农业工人和很多其他行业的劳动者。根据美国工会刊物的资料，美国有一百五十万个每年收入不到一千美元的农户。
