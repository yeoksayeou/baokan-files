　　Martyr Lin Xiangqian's Widow, Chen Guizhen, Denounces Rightists
　　The Blood of Millions of Martyrs Cannot Be Shed in Vain
    Fuzhou, June 16th (from our newspaper) Chen Guizhen, the widow of Martyr Lin Xiangqian, who is currently giving reports to workers in various parts of Fujian, published a talk in the Fujian Daily on the 17th entitled "Defend Socialism, Defend the People's Happiness." She said that recently some people have made statements against socialism, which has aroused my hatred for the reactionaries again. I want to speak out against this nonsense.
    She said that during the time of the Northern Warlords, Martyr Lin Xiangqian and I suffered from the oppression of the reactionaries together. In 1907, Lin Xiangqian, his father, and his younger brother worked at the Jiang'an Railway Factory. At that time, the three of them together earned only one yuan and ten cents a day. By 1923, after Xiangqian had worked in the factory for more than ten years, his daily wage had only increased from forty cents to seventy-five cents, which was about the same as the wages of apprentices today. The money was so little, but the capitalists still defaulted on wages. If we were sick or had a holiday, we wouldn't get a penny. Our family of seven didn't even have enough to eat congee. At that time, workers had to work twelve hours a day and were often beaten and kicked by foremen, and we didn't even have the freedom to speak. Martyr Xiangqian launched the "February 7th" strike together with the workers to oppose this exploitation and oppression. He and his brother sacrificed their lives in the struggle. In less than a year, the martyr's father was kicked to death by a foreman.
    She said: I hoped that the day Xiangqian fought for with his life would come. I persevered until liberation, and finally the light came. Our son, Guan Kang, entered the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory as a worker, and his work and life are both very good. I also served as a member of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference and a member of the County People's Committee, speaking and working for the people. Looking back on the past, I know even better what to love and what to hate. Now, some people are actually saying that socialism is not good, that the Communist Party cannot lead, and even brazenly say "kill the Communists," which is really nonsense. I want to tell these people that today is the world of the people, and the fruits of victory that Lin Xiangqian and millions of martyrs exchanged with their lives will absolutely not be allowed to be destroyed.

### 林祥谦烈士夫人陈桂贞痛斥右派  千万烈士的血不能白流

　　林祥谦烈士夫人陈桂贞痛斥右派
　　千万烈士的血不能白流
    本报福州16日电　正在向福建各地工人作报告的林祥谦烈士夫人陈桂贞，17日在福建日报发表题为“保卫社会主义，保卫人民的幸福”的谈话。她说，最近竟有人说出反对社会主义的话，又引起我对反动派的仇恨，我要出来说话，反对这种胡说。
    她说，北洋军阀时代，林祥谦烈士和我一起受着反动派的压迫。1907年，林祥谦烈士和他的父亲、弟弟在江岸铁路工厂做工。当时三个人工资加起来一天才一元一角。到了1923年，祥谦在工厂做了十几年以后，一天的工资才由四角增加到七角五，和现在的学徒工资差不多。钱这么少，但资本家还拖欠工资。碰上生病和放假，一文工钱也不给。我们全家七口人连吃稀饭都不够。那时候，工人一天要干十二个钟头的活，经常受工头拳打脚踢，连说话的自由也没有。祥谦烈士就是为了反对这种剥削和压迫，同工人一起发动了“二七”大罢工。他和他的弟弟在斗争中牺牲了生命。不到一年，烈士的父亲又被工头一脚踢死。
    她说：我盼着祥谦用生命争取的一天会来到。我熬到了解放，光明终于来了。我们的儿子冠康进了福州汽车修配厂做工，工作和生活都很好。我也担任了省政协委员和县人民委员会委员，替人民说话办事。回想过去，我更知道要爱什么，要恨什么。现在居然有人说社会主义不好，共产党不能领导，还猖狂地说“杀共产党”，这真是胡说。我要告诉这些人，今天已是人民的天下，林祥谦和千万个烈士用生命换来的胜利果实，绝对不容许破坏。
