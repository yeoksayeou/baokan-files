    High Winds and Little Rain, Serious Drought
    Hebei Launches Drought Resistance Campaign
    This newspaper's Baoding dispatch, June 2nd: Hebei Province has recently experienced high winds and little rain, and the drought is becoming increasingly severe. According to reports from various regions, the Tangshan Special District has seen moisture loss of more than one inch in over 180,000 mu of land, with some mountainous areas drying out by more than three inches. Land that has already been sown cannot guarantee seedling emergence, and land that has not been sown cannot be planted. In southern areas where planting occurred earlier, the emerging seedlings are also finding it difficult to grow. In the Tianjin Special District, 200 mu of wheat has already died from drought.
    In order to immediately launch a mass drought resistance campaign, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency notice to Party committees at all levels throughout the province on June 1st. The notice first pointed out that the current severe drought situation prevalent throughout the province directly threatens the realization of this year's bumper agricultural harvest, but the Party and government leaders in some areas have not paid sufficient attention to this serious situation. Some counties had not watered a single mu of wheat fields by May 20th, and some agricultural cooperatives still have 4% of their labor force unwilling to engage in agricultural production, instead being keen on sideline occupations and all kinds of trading activities. This situation must be reversed immediately.
    The notice continued: June and July are decisive months for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest for the whole year, and they are also crucial to alleviating the tense grain situation, which is a major contradiction across the province. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must concentrate their efforts to quickly launch a mass drought resistance campaign; leading comrades of Party and government at all levels, as well as cadres and stationed troops, should directly participate in the drought resistance campaign. The notice also pointed out that, apart from the grain purchase and sales work, all work that hinders agricultural production should be suspended or postponed. The notice requires Party committees at all levels to immediately study and deploy this work. The first secretaries of the prefectural and county committees must immediately take charge of the leadership of agricultural production in the spirit of rectification.

    风多雨少　旱象严重
    河北开展抗旱运动
    本报保定2日电　河北省近日来风多雨少，旱象越来越严重。据各地汇报，唐山专区已有十八万多亩土地失墒一寸多，有的山区已干三寸多，已经播种的土地不能保证出苗，未播种的土地不能进行播种，南部已经播种较早的地区，出土的幼苗生长也很困难，天津专区有二百亩小麦已经旱死。
    为立即掀起一个群众性的抗旱运动，中共河北省委会特于6月1日向全省各级党委发出紧急通知。通知首先指出：当前全省各地普遍呈现的严重旱象已经直接威胁着今年农业大丰收的实现，但是这一严重情况有些地区的党政领导还未引起高度注意。有的县到5月20日麦田一亩未浇，有些农业社4％的劳力仍不愿做农业生产，热衷于副业和一切商贩活动。这种情况应当立即扭转。
    通知继续指出：六、七月份是争取全年农业大丰收具有决定意义的季节，也是能否缓和全省主要矛盾粮食紧张局面的关键所在。因此，各级党委要集中力量迅速开展一个群众性的抗旱运动；各级党政负责同志以及干部和驻军都应直接地参加抗旱运动。通知并指出当前除粮食征购销工作外，一切妨碍农业生产的工作都应停止或推迟。通知要求各地党委立即研究部署这一工作。地委县委第一书记要以整风的精神立即抓起农业生产的领导。
