	Reassurance, Tolerance, and Personnel Work
	Xiao Qian

	One day before yesterday, I went to a laundromat to pick up some clothes. Outside the counter, a customer was arguing with the clerk, apparently because the store had scorched a piece of the customer's clothing. The customer was aggressive, forgetting that the laundromat had long been jointly owned by the public and private sectors, and was spouting accusations like "bourgeois ideology" and "profit-seeking," typical of the Five-Anti Campaign. But the bigger the accusations, the less convinced the clerk seemed. He said, "If it's scorched, we'll apologize to you, won't we!" ("Apologize" was shouted out with a scowl, the tone quite unsuited to the word.) The person whose clothes had been scorched clearly didn't get any compensation from this "apology" (either spiritually or materially), so they refused to let it go. At this point, the clerk stiffened his face, appearing to gain the upper hand, and said righteously: "You really haven't been studying hard enough! Since I've apologized and admitted my mistake, why are you still being so unreasonable?"

	Listening from the side, I was quite moved. In our society, there's a strong and healthy political atmosphere, but the degree to which politics is vulgarized is also considerable. "Apologizing" has actually become a tactic of retreating to advance, and "studying poorly" has become a term of abuse.

	How did that clerk come up with the "brilliant" tactic of "apologizing first"? In recent years, I've had an observation that I'm not sure about – and when I say I'm not sure, I mean that my observation might be completely wrong, and I also hope it is wrong – and that is: due to various factors (including how the past movements were carried out), our revolutionary society (until the climate changed recently), has gradually formed a kind of terrifying "revolutionary cynicism"; everyone exists in a state of mutual vigilance. For example, when criticized, instead of arguing back when you disagree, you apologize first. Other manifestations of this "revolutionary cynicism" include: keeping people at arm's length, making bland and harmless statements, checking the political climate before writing, echoing every call to action to show your attitude, but not having your own opinion on anything.

	Everyone is responsible for the formation of this phenomenon (for example, writers lack courage), but the dogmatists bear a significant responsibility as well. They mostly hold leadership positions, and the mantis that dares to resist the wheels of a car with its arms is, after all, in the minority. There are two very vivid idioms in our country: "killing the chicken to scare the monkey" and "the rabbit dies, the fox grieves"; the dogmatists never just strike down one person with their club, but many.

	In the early days of liberation, I saw a booklet from the Southwest that criticized a full-length novel with principled errors ("Rebirth Record"). Some chapters began like this: "After reading ×××'s criticism of this novel, I was deeply indignant." Then, based on the criticism of that novel, they started writing their own criticism.

	"Fifteen Strings of Cash" was indeed a huge success in the work of sorting out classical plays. The Central Committee recommended it to encourage everyone to learn from this spirit of adapting plays from a positive perspective. But one morning, I got the "People's Daily" and was shocked. The bottom of page seven was filled with "Fifteen Strings of Cash" from every theater and every genre in the city, all the same. At the time, I thought: this could be said to be the most typical expression of our cultural circles "responding" to any intrinsically unimpeachable call from the Party.

	I asked a friend: "Our revolutionary society is supposed to constantly produce newer and better ideas, why is it instead so conformist, so imitative, so lacking in originality?" He said, "Because our society opposes individual prominence." But how can you conflate individual style and individual viewpoints with individual prominence and eliminate them all together? What's frightening is that many people think this is "organizational discipline."

	It can be said that what distinguishes humans from animals is only a tiny bit: independent thinking. Without independent thinking, Marx and Engels blindly followed Hegel and Feuerbach, and there would be no dialectical materialism. Without independent thinking, it's like swallowing raw fish and meat without cooking or chewing – not only can it not be transformed into nutrition, it will definitely cause indigestion. In a sense, I feel that "letting a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is actually the process of the whole country chewing and digesting new ideas and new cultures. Since we're talking about digestion, there must be nutrition and excretion. Only in this way can our cultural bloodlines flow smoothly, and our creation can flourish.

	I think that "letting a hundred flowers bloom" requires two kinds of "letting go." First, writers must "let out" their ingenuity, and second, leaders – especially Party leaders – must "let go" of their worries.

	Why has literary and art work tended to adopt administrative leadership methods in the past? I think it's because leaders aren't confident enough in those they lead. Why are some magazine editors still worried about the "fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds" issue? It's probably because they aren't confident enough in the judgment of today's readers and the political level of most writers. Even, why are our papers so verbose? Why is our creation so lacking in aftertaste? I think it's also because writers aren't confident enough in the understanding and imagination of the readers. And whether or not we can truly change the situation of literary journals becoming like government offices, I estimate the key lies in this.

	The governments of capitalist countries are uneasy about their cultural figures. We should be able to be confident, because justice is on our side, the people are on our side. If everyone is more confident in each other, the flowers will naturally bloom slowly.

	Two
	Before capitalist countries entered the stage of imperialism, they had a very heroic saying: "I completely disagree with your view, but I would sacrifice my life to defend your right to express that view." This sentence embodies their pride in their constitution, their democratic traditions, and their system. Now, that constitution has long been trampled into a pile of waste paper by the running dogs of monopoly capital like McCarthy and Dulles. Now, when people in those countries mention this sentence, they no longer feel pride, but indignation, sarcasm, and sorrow. That heroic saying means: whether what a person says is right or wrong is one thing, whether they can say it is another. Whether or not to allow the expression of incorrect words is a serious test of any democratic constitution. Today, at least the two countries that call themselves "democratic," Britain and the United States, have long gone bankrupt in the face of this test. The "Magna Carta," which their bourgeois revolutionary martyrs exchanged for with blood, has long been torn to shreds by the anti-communist gang directed by those financial tycoons and arms kings.

	From the "Common Program" to the Constitution, our country has explicitly stipulated that the people enjoy freedom of speech and publication. Moreover, since liberation, every Chinese person can proudly say that our government has never ordered the banning of a book. Unfortunately, we cannot yet further say: every Chinese person has already had the freedom to speak and write.

	We leapt from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society in 1949 straight into a socialist society. In the meantime, we cannot be considered to have had much training in the spirit of democracy. The so-called "spirit of democracy" should include being able to tolerate people you don't like, and tolerate words you don't like. Because the revolution progressed quickly, the promotion of cadres sometimes failed to keep pace with their own improvement. If there is some deviation in wielding "democracy" and "dictatorship," and "reckless talk" is easily treated as "reckless action," then, in the name of maintaining the Constitution, things that are essentially contrary to the Constitution will be done.

	Currently, "contention" mainly relies on the Central Committee to call for it, and on an atmosphere of "movement" to support it. The energy is great, but to sustain it, we also need a guarantee, to establish a social ethos, and even, like the Party Central Committee's attitude toward criticism and self-criticism, to formulate a principle: not treating other people's views, thoughts, and statements with a tyrannical attitude is a sacred duty that every citizen should fulfill to the Constitution.

	In recent years, some people who could have approached Marxism-Leninism have become estranged. These people themselves, of course, bear the main responsibility. But those dogmatists who mystify Marxism-Leninism, vulgarize it, and use it as a club also bear responsibility. They force people to feel antipathy toward politics. I believe that for most people, the more there is the possibility of independent thinking and free choice, the more consciously they will accept Marxism-Leninism, because truth itself has an irresistible attraction.

	Three
	When it comes to "reassurance" and "tolerance," of course, no one's thoughts should include counter-revolutionary words and deeds. However, to ensure the long-term implementation of this democratic policy within the people, it is necessary to strictly draw a red line between incorrect views and counter-revolutionary remarks, and the future deviations and difficulties may lie hidden here.

	In the current early summer climate, comrades whose emotions have been suppressed for many years, with the support of the Central Committee, have the opportunity to express their views, and their mood is naturally suddenly cheerful. But some comrades who are doing leadership work today, and who will continue to do leadership work in the future, I estimate may have a feeling that "intellectuals are inherently difficult to deal with, and now it will be even more difficult." Among them, I also estimate that the most troublesome will be those who do personnel and ideological work, such as the heads of personnel departments in government agencies, schools, and people's organizations. But I've also heard many people say: whether or not a democratic atmosphere can be guaranteed in the future, the practices of the personnel departments, as the left and right hands of the Party organization in dealing with "people's" issues, are indeed key.

	When the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was first proposed, I heard a member of the China Democratic League say privately: from political assessments and grade evaluations, to salary evaluations, to obtaining marriage registration certificates and whether or not children can enter the agency's nursery, everything is controlled by the personnel department, so what mutual supervision are we talking about? Of course, this statement is biased, even distorted, and clearly has emotional resistance to the personnel department. As long as we support the people's democratic dictatorship and accept the leadership of the Party, we should respect the personnel department and recognize its necessity and importance within the agency. However, shouldn't the personnel department also consider how to improve its working methods in the future?

	I know that some non-Party comrades simply regard the personnel department as a police station stationed inside the agency, but today's police stations are also very different from the past. Before liberation, the police station was mysterious and terrifying. Ordinary people would rather take a detour than get close to it. Today's police station, in the south room they are vaccinating children, in the north room they are issuing food and cloth coupons, and in the west room a comrade may be tirelessly mediating family disputes. From morning to night, citizens come and go in a constant stream. In short, the police station today has changed from a mysterious and terrifying institution to one that embodies the government's care for the people. But as far as my observations go, although some agencies and organizations' personnel departments are not terrifying, they are somewhat mysterious. The department often has a safe containing personnel files (my personal impression is that non-Party leading cadres cannot see this material, even if it would benefit their work), and some old cadres who don't interact much with everyone. A small part of this estrangement is necessary for work (in fact, I still don't know why there is such a need), and a large part is due to different experiences. The advantage of these old cadres is that they are simple, and their shortcomings in work often occur in this area: they don't understand the old society of China, so they often lack understanding of the intellectuals in the agency. At best, they don't interact with ordinary cadres, at worst, they harbor contempt for each other culturally and politically.

	In addition, some people feel this way: writing letters to the Party branch (including the Central Propaganda Department) or the personnel department is often like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response. This feeling is more uncomfortable than being beaten with a stick, and less political help is received. This naturally increases an unhealthy sense of mystery, which itself forms a wall without any doors or windows.

	Naturally, on a national scale, the work of the personnel department must still be healthy. They work very hard and have made many achievements, and it is unfair to write them off completely; however, in my personal limited contact, I feel that the work of some personnel departments has shortcomings, and these shortcomings do more harm than good to resolving contradictions among the people.

	For example, when the China Democratic League organization of a people's organization was discussing the admission of a certain comrade into the League, the responsible comrade who had contact with the personnel department mentioned in the introductory material: when a certain international event occurred, someone reported that this comrade had said something that was not very correct.

	That people's organization learned a lesson from the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement: without solid evidence, suspicion should not be easily formed, and therefore investigation should not be easily carried out. But a civil servant (a nephew of a Party member comrade), because a certain cadre gave him opinions on his work, immediately retaliated, insisting that three years ago he had seen that cadre engaging in indecent behavior in his dormitory five times in a row. The personnel department, without asking right from wrong, sent two people to investigate; moreover, they investigated for more than half a year, and still haven't come to a conclusion.

	That organization has an affiliated institution, which for a period of time in the past had no Party members. The branch secretary and the deputy secretary-general in charge of the personnel department (the same comrade) mainly relied on some "reports" from an "activist" in the institution. As a result, the internal atmosphere became suspicious and distrustful, and the masses were once opposed to the branch. It wasn't until that institution had Party members, and until the later stages of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, that it was discovered that the "activist" was not very active at all, but the work had already caused irreparable losses. I heard that a comrade in the institution who had been working for seven or eight years had firmly withdrawn from the revolutionary ranks. Wouldn't this be considered a subjective approach?

	Even the laws of the feudal era emphasized that murder must have a murder weapon to be established. I believe that in order to distinguish right from wrong and prevent confusing malicious accusations with genuine reports to the organization, a specification should be set for "reports." For example, there must be some kind of evidence or corroboration to be counted. It cannot be that anyone's word can put another person in a bad light. Second, unnecessary delays only deepen the distance between the masses and the organization. Since an investigation has been conducted, either it exists or it doesn't, and it should not be left unfinished. Third, an incorrect statement, even if verified, can only be regarded as a person's thoughts at a certain moment, and should not suddenly become a "personnel file" that follows the person. Fourth, it should be acknowledged that an incorrect statement that is spoken is better than one that is not spoken. Its treatment should not be to be secretly recorded, but rather to provide assistance as appropriate. Only in this way can internal contradictions be resolved.

	Our people's regime mainly relies on the active strength of the people and extensively contacting the masses, not mainly relying on the "reports" of a few people. In the past, the work of some personnel departments may have overemphasized the aspect of vigilance, and although they did not completely believe "reports," they also did not demand much rigor. In the past movements, there seemed to be no punishment for those who were clearly intentionally fabricating and maliciously accusing. If there is a lack of direct contact, and the situation of the majority is judged based on the understanding of a few, it is not easy to avoid sectarian and subjective errors.

	In general, personnel departments that work in this way are bound to have a lot of prejudices against cadres, and when a time like the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries actually comes, they are at a loss. In fact, although there are cases of catching spies due to accurate "reports," there have also been cases where inaccurate "reports" have seriously affected the unity between comrades, even unnecessarily harmed comrades, and wronged good people. At that time, it is often the personnel department itself that is most passive and loses credibility.

	Now everyone is shouting about "tearing down walls," and I completely agree that it should be torn down from both sides. Moreover, I believe that comrades in charge of personnel and ideological work can play a huge role in this significant work. For example, carefully clean up the personnel files of each cadre: if there are still some unsubstantiated rumors or small notes that have been proven to be untrue, tear them up; for shortcomings in ideology and style, educate the relevant cadres in a timely manner through various means; for some measures that have confused cadres in the past, try to explain them clearly to him; at the same time, what should be questioned of cadres, unless it is a counter-revolutionary nature, it is best to ask clearly in person (this work should have already been done somewhat during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries and Cadre Review). In the future, let the personnel department be more of a place where everyone can appeal grievances and tell their suffering; become a place that not only does security work, but also resolves internal contradictions and strengthens internal unity.

	To carry out the work of "contending" and "letting go" in a long-term and healthy manner within the agency, I believe that the comrades in the agency who do Party and personnel work (often the same group of people) also need to carry out a two-front struggle: both to broadly open the door for "reports," so that villains cannot succeed, and to avoid, in objective effect, condoning "reports" that are untrue and driven by personal motives and destructive to unity. In this way, the circle of activists will inevitably grow larger and larger, and more comrades will be close to the organization, and everyone will be able to express their heartfelt words without any hesitation on the basis of mutual trust.

    放心·容忍·人事工作
    萧乾
    一前天我去一家洗衣店取衣服，柜台外边有个顾客正跟店员吵嘴，大概店里把那人的衣服给烫糊了一块。客人气势汹汹，忘记了洗衣店早已公私合营，就满口飞起“资产阶级思想”、“唯利是图”一类五反时期的帽子；可是帽子越大，柜台里头的那个人越不服气。他说，烫糊了，我们向你检讨不就完了么！（“检讨”两个字是横眉立目地嚷出来的，说的神气跟那个字眼儿很不相称。）那个衣服给烫糊了的人显然没从这个“检讨”得到任何补偿（无论是精神上或者是物质上），所以也还是不肯罢休。这时候，店员就绷起脸来，俨然占了上风似的，理直气壮地说：你这个人真是学习得太差啦！我既然向你检讨认错了，你怎么还不依不饶？
    我在旁听了，颇有感触。在我们的社会里，有浓厚的健康的政治空气，可是把政治庸俗化的程度也很可观。“检讨”居然成了以退为进的反攻战术，“学习差”成了骂语。
    那个店员怎么会想出“抢先检讨”这个“高明”战术来的呢？这里，近年来我有一种自己没有把握的观察——没把握，是说，我这个观察可能完全不对头，而且我也希望它是不对头——那就是：由于种种因素（包括历次运动的搞法），我们这个革命的社会（直到最近气候改变以前），已经逐渐形成了一种可怕的“革命世故”；大家相互之间存在着一种戒备状态。譬如说，挨了批评明明心里不服，不还嘴，反而抢先检讨之类。这种“革命世故”的表现还有：对人不即不离，发言不痛不痒，下笔先看行情，什么号召都人云亦云地表示一下态度，可对什么也没有个自己的看法。
    这种现象的形成，每个人都有责任（譬如说，作家们勇气不足），但是教条主义者的责任也很不小，他们大半都居于领导地位，而敢于用胳臂抗拒车轮的螳螂毕竟占少数。我国有两句非常形象化的成语：“杀鸡吓猴”“兔死狐悲”；教条主义者一棍子打死的绝不是一个人，而是许多人。
    解放初期，我见过西南出的一本小册子，批判一部有原则性错误的长篇小说（“再生记”），其中，有些篇是这么开头的：“我看了×××对这部小说的批评，深为愤慨”。然后，就根据对那部小说的批评，写起批评来。
    “十五贯”在古典剧的整理工作上，的确是个巨大成功。中央推荐它，是叫大家学习这种从积极方面搞戏改的精神。可是有一天早晨，我拿到“人民日报”吓了一跳，七版底下登的是全市各个剧院、各个剧种，清一色的“十五贯”。当时我想：这可说是我们文化界“响应”党的任何本身无可非议的号召最典型的表现了。
    我问过一个朋友：咱们这个革命的社会就是要不断地出现更新、更好的见解，为什么反而会这么人云亦云、人演亦演，这么缺乏独创性呢？他说，因为咱们这个社会反对个人突出。可怎么能把个人风格、个人看法，跟个人突出混同起来，一道消灭呢？可怕的是，不少人认为这就是“组织性纪律性”。
    可以说，人之异于禽兽者几希，独立思考而已矣。没有独立思考，马克思、恩格斯盲目地跟着黑格尔、费尔巴哈走，就不会有辩证唯物主义。没有独立思考，就等于生鱼生肉没经过烹饪、咀嚼就吞下去，不但不能变成营养，一定反而还会闹消化不良。在一个意义上，我觉得“百花齐放、百家争鸣”本身，实际上也就是全国咀嚼、消化新思潮、新文化的过程。既然说消化，就一定得有营养，也有排泄。这样，我们的文化血脉才能舒畅，我们的创作才能繁荣。
    我看“百花齐放”里要有两个“放”字才成，一是作家要把匠心“放”出来，一是领导——特别是党的领导要“放”得下心。
    为什么过去文艺工作倾向于采取行政领导的方式呢？我看就是因为领导者对被领导者不够放心。为什么目前有些刊物编辑对“鲜花毒草”问题还在嘀咕？大概就是因为他们对今天读者的判断力以及对绝大部分写稿人的政治水平还不够放心。甚至，为什么我们的论文写得那么啰嗦？我们的创作为什么那么缺乏余味？我看也是因为作家对读者的理解力和想像力不够放心。而能不能真正改变文学刊物机关化的状况，估计关键也就在这上头。
    资本主义国家的政府对他们的文化人是放心不下的，我们应该是可以放心的，因为正义在我们这边，人民在我们这边。大家彼此都放心一些，花，自然就会慢慢放开啦。 二在资本主义国家没进入帝国主义阶段以前，他们有一句非常豪迈的话：“我完全不同意你的看法，但是我情愿牺牲我的性命，来维护你说出这个看法的权利”。在这句话里蕴藏着他们对自己的宪法、对他们的民主传统和制度的自豪。现在，他们那宪法早已经被麦卡锡、杜勒斯那些垄断资本的走狗踩成一团烂纸了。现在，提起这句话来，那些国家的人民感到的不再是自豪，而是愤慨，讽刺和哀伤。那句豪迈的话意味着：一个人说的话对不对是一件事，他可不可以说出来是另外一件事。准不准许说不对的话是任何民主宪法的严重考验。今天，至少英美这两个自诩为“民主的”国家，在这个考验面前早就破了产。他们资产阶级的革命先烈用鲜血换来的“大宪章”，早已经被那些金融大亨、军火大王指挥下的反共大家撕成碎片了。
    从“共同纲领”到宪法，我们国家对于人民享有言论、著作的自由，都有明文规定。而且，解放以来，每个中国人都可以自豪地说，我们的政府从来也没下命令查禁过一本书。可惜我们目前还不能进一步说：每个中国人都已经有了说话和写作的自由了。
    我们从1949年的半封建半殖民地的社会一下就飞跃到社会主义社会，这中间，我们在民主精神的锻炼上，不能算很多。所谓“民主精神”，应该包括能容忍你不喜欢的人，容忍你不喜欢的话。由于革命进展得很快，干部的提升有时候也与他们本身的提高难得相称。假使在掌握“民主”与“专政”的时候有些偏，轻易把“乱说”当作“乱动”来办，就会在维护宪法的名义下，干出实质上是违背宪法的事。
    目前“争鸣”主要还是靠中央来号召，靠一股“运动”的空气在支撑，劲头很大，但是要持久下去，就还需要一种保证，树立一种社会风气，甚至像党中央对批评与自我批评那样制定出一条原则：不以横暴态度对待别人的看法、想法和说法是每个公民对宪法应尽的一份神圣义务。
    几年来，若干有可能接近马列主义的人却疏远了，这些人自己当然要负主要责任。但是那些把马列主义神秘化，庸俗化，拿马列主义当棍子使用的教条主义者也有责任，他们逼人家对政治起反感。我相信对于大部分人来说，越是有独立思考、自由选择的可能，就越会自觉地接受马克思列宁主义，因为真理本身原是具有不可抗拒的吸引力的。
  三谈到“放心”和“容忍”，当然谁的思想里也不会包括反革命的言行。然而要保证长期在人民内部贯彻这种民主政策，就需要在不正确的见解与反革命的言论之间，严格地划一道红线，而今后的偏向和困难，可能就潜伏在这里。
    在目前的初夏气候里，多年来感情上受压抑的同志们，在中央的撑腰下，得到一抒己见的机会，心情当然是豁然开朗了；而有些今天做领导工作、以后也仍然要做领导工作的同志，心里我估计可能会有“知识分子本来就不好搞，这下子就更加不好搞了”之感。其中，我还估计最感觉棘手的，是做人事及思想工作的，如机关、学校、人民团体的人事科科长们。可是我也听到不少人说：今后民主空气保证得了保证不了，作为党组织处理“人”的问题的左右手的人事部门的做法，还的确是个关键。
    当“长期共存、互相监督”的政策刚提出来的时候，我听到一位民主同盟的盟员私下里说：从政治鉴定、评级评薪，到领结婚登记的证明书、孩子能不能进机关的托儿所，都掌握在人事科手里，还谈什么互相监督。当然，这个说法偏，甚至歪，在感情上显然对人事部门有抵触。我们只要拥护人民民主专政，接受党的领导，就应该尊重人事部门，认识到它在机关内部的必要性和重要性。但是，人事部门是不是同时也应该考虑一下今后如何改进工作的方式呢？
    我知道有些非党同志干脆把人事科看作驻在机关内部的派出所，不过今天的派出所也大大不同于以往了。解放前，派出所是神秘的、恐怖的，一般人走路宁可多绕几步，也离它远远的。今天的派出所呢，南屋里正给孩子们种牛痘，北屋发着粮票布票，西屋里一位同志也许正舌敝唇焦地给人调解家庭纠纷，从早到晚，市民是川流不息地来往。总之，派出所今天已经从神秘恐怖变为体现政府关怀人民的机构了。可是就我的见闻所及，有些机关团体的人事部门虽然没有恐怖，但却多少带有一些神秘味道。科里时常是一只放人事材料的保险柜（我个人的印象是：这种材料非党的领导干部即使对工作有好处，也看不到），和一些跟大家不大往来的老干部。这种隔阂一小部分是工作上的必要（其实，我始终也不知道为什么会有这种必要），一大部分是由于经历的不同。这些老干部的优点在于单纯，而他们工作上的缺点也常常发生在这上头：他们对中国旧社会不大了解，因而，对机关里的知识分子时常也就缺乏了解。轻则和一般干部互不往来，重则在文化和政治上，彼此各存着轻蔑心理。
      另外，还有人这样感觉：给党总支（包括中央宣传部）或是人事部门写信，时常是石沉大海，不见回音。这个滋味比挨顿棍子要难受多了，政治上得到的帮助也少得多。这自然也更增加了不健康的神秘感，它本身就形成一道完全没有门窗的墙。
    自然，在全国范围来说，人事部门的工作一定还是健康的。他们非常辛苦，也做出许多成绩，一笔抹煞是不公平的；不过，在我个人有限的接触中，我感到有些人事部门的工作有缺点，而这种缺点对于解决人民内部的矛盾是弊多利少的。
    比方说，一个人民团体的民盟组织在讨论吸收某一同志入盟的时候，与人事部门有联系的负责同志在介绍材料时提到：在某一国际事件发生时，有人反映这位同志曾说过一句什么不很正确的话。
    那个人民团体从肃反运动中总结出一条教训：没有确凿证据，不能轻易构成嫌疑，因而也不能轻易进行追查。可是一个公务员（一个党员同志的外甥）由于某干部对他的工作提意见，他立刻倒打一耙，硬说三年前曾经连续五次看见那个干部在宿舍里有猥亵行为。人事科不问青红皂白，就派了两个人进行调查；而且，调查了半年多，到现在仍然没个下文。
      这个团体有个附属机构，过去一段时间那里没有党员。支部书记和掌握人事科的副秘书长（同一位同志）主要信赖机构里一个“积极分子”的一些“反映”。结果闹得内部疑神疑鬼，互不团结，并且使得群众一度跟支部对立起来。直到那个机构有了党员，并且挨到肃反后期，才发现那位“积极分子”原来并不怎么积极，然而工作上早已造成了无可弥补的损失。听说机构里一位参加工作七、八年的同志已经坚决退出了革命队伍。这算不算是主观主义的作法呢？
      连封建时代的法律还讲究凶杀必有凶器才能成立，我认为为了明辨是非，防止把挟嫌诬陷与真正向组织汇报情况混同起来，应该给“反映”定出一个规格来；比方说，必须有某种证据或旁证才能算数，不能任何人一句话就能叫另外一个人背上黑锅。第二，不必要的拖延只有加深群众与组织之间的距离。既然调查了，有就是有，没有就是没有，不宜于不了了之。第三，对于一句不正确的话，即使证实了，也只能作为一个人某一时刻的想法，不宜遽然成为跟着这个人走的“人事材料”。第四，应该承认说出来的不正确的话比不说出来的要好，它得到的待遇不应该是被暗地里记下来，而应该相机地进行帮助。只有这样，才能使内部矛盾得到解决。
    我们的人民政权主要是倚靠人民的积极力量，广泛地联系群众，而不是主要倚靠少数人的“反映”。过去，有些人事部门的工作可能过分偏重于警惕的一面，对于“反映”虽不至完全听信，可也要求不苛。历次运动对显然有意捏造和挟嫌诬告者，事后似乎都没有什么惩诫。如果缺乏直接的接触，只根据少数人的认识来判断多数人的情况，就不容易避免宗派主义、主观主义的错误。
    大凡用这种方法工作的人事部门，必然平时对干部成见一大堆，真正遇到肃反那样时机，反而心中无数。事实上，由于准确的“反映”而抓到特务的事有，由于不准确的“反映”而严重地影响同志之间的团结，甚而不必要地伤害了同志，冤枉了好人的事也发生过。那时候，最陷于被动、最丧失威信的，常常正是人事部门本身。
    现在大家都嚷着“拆墙”，我完全同意应该从两面拆，而且，我认为负责人事和思想工作的同志在这个意义重大的工作上，可以起极大的作用。比方说，把每个干部的人事材料好好清理一下：要是还有些捕风捉影、已经证实不符事实的小条条，就撕掉；属于思想作风上的缺点的，及时地通过各种方式向有关的干部进行教育；过去有些措施使干部感到困惑不解的，也尽量向他说个明白；同时，该质问干部的，除非是反革命性质，也最好当面问个清楚（这个工作在肃反审干的时候应该已经做了一些吧）。今后，让人事部门更能成为大家有冤可以申，有苦可以诉；成为不仅仅做保卫工作，同时也能解决内部矛盾、加强内部团结的地方。
    要在机关内部长期、健康地展开“鸣”和“放”的工作，我认为机关里做党和人事工作的同志（常常是同样一批人）也需要进行两条战线的斗争：既要广开“反映”之门，使歹人无法得逞，又要避免在客观效果上纵容不真实、并且带个人动机、破坏团结的“反映”。这样一来，积极分子的圈子必然就会越来越大，就会有更多的同志们亲近组织，而大家也就会在互相信任的基础上，毫无忌惮地发出肺腑之言。
