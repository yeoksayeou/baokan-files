The Roots of the Communist Party Cannot Be Dug Up by Anyone
——A Critique of the Fallacies of Zhang Baisheng and Huang Zhenlü
Teacher at Xiguan Elementary School, Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, Zhang Mingwen

After reading the abstract of the article by Zhang Baisheng and Huang Zhenlü of Shenyang Normal College, my comrades and I were involuntarily filled with emotion.

Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang said that the Central Committee committed “the greatest subjectivism” in the "Supression of Counterrevolutionaries" and "Counter-Revolutionary Suppression" campaigns. I don’t know what their basis is? I only know that Mao Huanqing, the puppet county magistrate of our county, deceived people too much and actively opposed the Communist Party, so he was suppressed. A small number of counter-revolutionaries hidden in our elementary school teacher ranks had organized a “Kuomintang Underground Work Committee” and confessed in the purge. I also remember when Tianjin "suppressed counter-revolutionaries," citizens followed to watch every time a batch of counter-revolutionaries was executed, and upright citizens were not afraid but applauded. Many rickshaw pullers muttered "Serves them right! Serves them right! Serves them right!" But Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang said that the Central Committee committed “the greatest subjectivism”! More noteworthy is that these two gentlemen said that the "Supression of Counterrevolutionaries" and "Counter-Revolutionary Suppression" campaigns were "rather left than right, wronged good people, and undermined the legal system..." I don't want to repeat the guidelines and policies of the "Supression of Counterrevolutionaries". I just want to ask: Whose "legal system" was "undermined"? Shouldn't counter-revolutionaries be purged? How much investigation and research have you gentlemen done to know how many "good people" were "wronged" by the "left" in the "Supression of Counterrevolutionaries"? "There is nothing wrong under the sky, but fools trouble themselves." Is there really nothing wrong under the sky? Have you read Minister Luo Ruiqing's report? Have you seen the many news reports of counter-revolutionaries carrying out sabotage activities? Do you know about the special agent Long Peiqiang who was caught by two young men in Guangzhou a few days ago for planting a time bomb? Who exactly are the "fools"?

Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang said that the "Supression of Counterrevolutionaries" and "Counter-Revolutionary Suppression" campaigns "attempt to maintain the fruits of the revolution by violence, which is contrary to our country's famous traditional ideas of 'loving the people like children,' 'establishing the country with virtue,' and 'governing the country by law.'" Gentlemen! Suppressing counter-revolutionaries and eliminating counter-revolutionary elements is precisely for the sake of "loving the people like children," "establishing the country with virtue," and "governing the country by law." Our "people" do not include counter-revolutionaries, our "law" is the "law" of the people, and our "virtue" is the "virtue" of serving the people. I don’t know whose "country" the two gentlemen are talking about? The so-called "traditional ideas" are nothing more than each having their own "virtue" and each having their own "law." I don’t know what kind of "virtue" and what "law" Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang are talking about?

Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang said: "The main source of the three evils lies in the Central Committee." I feel it is not worth wasting words on these fallacies (Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi have already published such fallacies). Just look at the newspapers and listen to the voices of people across the country supporting the cause of socialism, and you can understand. However, I would like to offer some unpleasant but sincere advice regarding these two gentlemen’s fantasies of "once and for all," "getting to the root," and "completely digging out the roots." Since its birth in 1921, the Chinese Communist Party has been sowing seeds among the people and has taken root. Now, it not only has stems and leaves but also blossoms and bears fruit. In the past, some people "dug" at the roots of the CCP, such as the "April 12th Incident," the "July 15th Incident," the five encirclement and suppression campaigns, the three anti-communist high tides during the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy," the US-Chiang Kai-shek offensive against Yan'an...etc. But they did not "dig" it up. The inevitable victory of socialism and the inevitable demise of capitalism is the law of historical development, and it does not change with the will of a few people. The CCP Central Committee cannot be "dug" up either, as evidenced by the history of the Party after the Zunyi Conference. If you insist on "digging," be careful of your own "roots." The strength of 600 million people will surely resist the strength of a few people!

Obviously, these two gentlemen are unwilling to hear and oppose phrases such as "Marxism-Leninism," "the great Chinese Communist Party," "the glorious Chinese Communist Party," and "the correct leadership of the Party." They believe that this is the Chinese Communist Party "self-admiration" and "self-praise." May I ask: Where is the Chinese Communist Party not great, not glorious, and not correct? Overthrowing the semi-feudal and semi-colonial rule, carrying out socialist transformation, eliminating classes and exploitation, wiping out a century of national humiliation, transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, protecting the interests of workers, helping ethnic minorities, and dedicating itself to international peace... I say: "Great! Glorious! Correct!" The workers say, the peasants say, the national capitalists who are willing to take the socialist road say, and the revolutionary democratic parties and intellectuals also say. Only the imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the counter-revolutionaries, and those who are dissatisfied with the revolution do not say it.

The two gentlemen oppose the Party's leadership over state organs, saying that the Party "puts itself above the state and above the people, with a great air of 'the Party is the state, the state is the Party.'" I think the gentlemen are in institutions of higher learning, they cannot be unaware of the essence of terms such as "state," "people," and "Party," but they just want to take advantage of the rectification movement to confuse the public in order to gain something. It seems that the gentlemen have seized something as a handle. In fact, anyone with a little common sense knows that the "state" is a tool of class rule serving a certain class, the "people" also have a certain scope, and the Party is the highest organizational form of class struggle. The nature of our country is most clearly stated in the Constitution and in Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," so it is best to read it again. May I ask: Who should lead a socialist country if not the working class and the Communist Party? Should it be led by the bourgeoisie? The Party's leadership over the state is not the Party replacing the government, nor is it a "supreme emperor," but rather through its own propaganda, organization, and other activities, to educate the people to make them believe in the correctness of the Party's policies, guidelines, and lines, to concentrate the will of the people, and then to have the people persist in it, in order to ensure the socialist direction and benefit the working people. The Communist Party has no private interests other than this. Our country has both the "National People's Congress" and its Standing Committee, and it has both the CPPCC and the State Council. In fact, every time the CCP raises a major issue, it organizes people from all walks of life to discuss it, extensively solicits opinions, submits it to the Standing Committee of the "National People's Congress" for review, discussion, modification, and approval, and then submits it to the State Council for specific research and implementation. There is also constant summarizing and soliciting of opinions from provinces, cities, and the people in the implementation. I, an elementary school teacher, also participated in several constitutional discussions. How can this be said to be "putting oneself above the state and above the people, the Party is the state, the state is the Party"? Why are you telling lies with your eyes open?! The "state" is a tool of class rule, without exception, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. The White House is controlled by Wall Street bosses, and the Chiang Kai-shek government serves the comprador bourgeoisie. Our country serves the people, with the working class at the head. Saying "above the people" depends on what "people" are being referred to, the "people" that Ge Peiqi speaks of? I say: It should! If those "people" are not suppressed, those "people" will turn around and suppress today's people. As for saying that "the Party can disobey the Constitution," I think this is nonsense. The Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people in fighting against internal and external enemies for decades, and it has finally obtained its own Constitution. How can it disobey it itself? It is true that individual Party members break the law. But individual Party members cannot be equated with the entire Party, just as someone spreading anti-Party remarks during the rectification movement cannot negate the good intentions of the majority of criticisms, and a few right-wingers can never represent the broad masses of non-Party people.

Speaking of democracy, I think whether the Communist Party speaks of democracy and whether there is democracy is not something that a few right-wingers can arbitrarily deny. There is democracy for this part of the people, but there is no democracy for another part of the people. This is true in China, and it is true abroad. I feel there is democracy, and the comrades who work with me feel there is democracy. If you ask the workers and peasants, they will feel there is even more democracy. How do the two gentlemen feel there is no democracy? Judging from the essential content of the articles written by the two of you with such painstaking effort, it is still better not to have the democracy that you gentlemen want. It is no small measure of democracy that your articles can be published in the people's newspapers.

The two gentlemen said that the CPPCC puts its main energy into organizing issues such as learning, which is a joke. I think this passage of the gentlemen is a joke! What's wrong with learning?! Building socialism is the foundation of "consultation." Studying Marxism-Leninism and establishing a common language is the basis for coming to agreement and "consulting." Otherwise, it will go to the opposite side. Moreover, the CPPCC has done many other things, and the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has just been reported. No one can deny these works of the CPPCC.

The two gentlemen are afraid of being labeled with the "iron hat of anti-Marxism-Leninism," but they have produced a steel helmet of anti-socialism. The gentlemen are afraid of being put on the "handcuffs of trumped-up charges," but they have published anti-socialist articles as facts. May I ask: Do you gentlemen want democracy? If you do, I will speak first. That is: If the bad guys who are anti-socialist continue to oppose it, they will only be expelled from the education front, and no freedom of anti-communist and anti-people speech will be given!

### 共产党的根谁也挖不掉——批判张百生、黄振旅的谬论

　　共产党的根谁也挖不掉
　　——批判张百生、黄振旅的谬论
　　河北涿鹿县西关初级小学教员　张铭闻
    看了沈阳师范学院张百生、黄振旅的文章摘要以后，不由的使我和周围的同志们感情激动起来。
    张、黄二位先生说：中央在“肃反”和“镇反”上是犯了“最大的主观主义”。我不知道他们的根据是什么？我只知道我们县的伪县长毛焕清欺人过甚，积极反共，被镇压了。在我们的小学教师队伍中隐藏着的少数反革命分子曾组织过“国民党地下工作委员会”，在肃反中坦白自首了。我还记得天津市“镇反”时，每处决一批反革命分子，市民们都跟着去看，正直的市民并无畏失，而是额手称快。许多三轮工人自言自语地说几个该！该！该！张、黄二先生却说：犯了“最大的主观主义”！更值得注意的是这二位先生说“肃反”和“镇反”是“宁左勿右，打错了好人，破坏了法制……。”关于“肃反”的方针政策我不想重复。我只想问问：“破坏了”谁的“法制”？反革命应该不应该肃？先生们作过多少调查和研究，因而知道“肃反‘左’了，打错了”多少“好人”？“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，天下真无事吗？看过罗瑞卿部长的报告没有？看见过许许多多的反革命分子进行破坏活动的通讯报道吗？前几天在广州被二个青年捉住的放定时炸弹的特务分子龙沛强的事儿你们知道吗？究竟谁是“庸人”啊？
    张、黄二位先生说：“肃反”和“镇反”是“企图用暴力维护革命果实，这与我国著名的‘爱民如子’、‘以德立国’、‘以法治国’的传统思想是背道而驰的”。先生啊！镇压反革命，肃清反革命分子正是为了“爱民如子”、“以德立国”、“以法治国”。我们的“民”是不包括反革命的，我们“法”是人民的“法”，我们的“德”是为人民服务的“德”。不知道二位先生所说的是谁的“国”？所谓“传统思想”也不过是各有各的“德”，各有各的“法”。不知道张、黄二位先生所说的是那种“德”？什么“法”？
    张、黄二位先生说：“三害的主要根源在中央”。我觉得不值得为这些谬论费口舌（储安平、葛佩琦早就发表了这样的谬论），只要看看报纸，听听全国拥护社会主义事业人们的呼声就可自晓。不过，我想就这二位先生的“一劳永逸”，“穷其根源”，“把根子彻底挖出”的幻想进一逆耳忠言。中国共产党从1921年诞生以来，就在人民群众中播种，并且扎了根，到现在不但生茎长叶而且开花结果了。过去有人“挖”过中共的根，像“四一二”，“七一五”，五次围剿，抗战期间三次反共高潮，日寇的三光政策，美蒋的进攻延安……等都是。但，没“挖”掉。社会主义必然胜利，资本主义必然灭亡这是历史发展的规律，它并不随着少数人的意志为转移。中共中央也是“挖”不掉的，这是“遵义会议”后的党的历史所证实了的。如果硬要“挖”，可小心自己的“根”子。六万万人的力量一定能抵得少数人的力量啊！
    很明显，这二位先生很不愿听也反对“马列主义”、“伟大的中国共产党”、“光荣的中国共产党”、“党的正确领导”等词句。认为这是中国共产党“自我欣赏”，“自吹自擂”。请问：中国共产党那儿不伟大、不光荣、不正确？推翻半封建半殖民地统治，进行社会主义改造，消灭阶级和剥削，雪掉百年来的国耻，变农业国为工业国，保护劳动者利益，帮助少数民族，致力于国际和平……，我说：“伟大！光荣！正确！”工人说，农民说，愿走社会主义道路的民族资本家说，革命的民主党派人士和知识分子也说。就是帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团、反革命分子和对革命不满的人不说。
    二位先生反对党对国家机关的领导，说党“把自己摆在国家之上、人民之上，大有‘党即国家、国家即党’的气派”。我想先生们在高等学校，对“国家”、“人民”、“党”等词的实质不会不知道，而只是想借整风之机，混淆视听，以便有所收获。似乎先生抓住什么把柄似的。其实略有常识的人都知道“国家”这个东西是服务于一定阶级的阶级统治工具，“人民”也有一定的范围，党是阶级斗争的最高组织形式。在宪法上和毛主席的“论人民民主专政”一书中对我国的性质说的最明白，最好是再看看。请问：社会主义国家不受工人阶级领导，不受共产党领导，受谁的领导？难道受资产阶级领导？党对国家的领导不是以党代政，也不是“太上皇”，而是要通过自己的宣传、组织等活动，教育人民使他们确信党的政策、方针、路线的正确，把人民群众的意志集中起来，再通过人民群众坚持下去，以便保证社会主义的方向，有利于劳动人民。除此之外共产党并无任何私利。我国既有“人大”也有他的常委会，既有政协也有国务院。事实上中共每提出一个重大问题，都要组织各阶层人们进行讨论，广泛征求意见，提“人大”常委会审查，讨论，修改，批准，再提交国务院具体研究付诸执行。在执行中也有不断总结，征求省市意见和人民群众的意见的。我这个小学教员还参加了几次宪法讨论。这怎能说“把自己摆在国家之上，人民之上，党即国家，国家即党”呢？为什么睁着眼说胡话呢？！“国家”是阶级统治的工具，古今中外都不例外。白宫受华尔街老板的控制，蒋政府服务于买办资产阶级。我们的国家则服务于以工人阶级为首的人民群众。说“人民之上”看是什么“人民”，葛佩琦所说的“人民”吗？我说：应该！不压在那些“人民”之上，那些“人民”就反过来压到今天这些人民之上了。至于说：“党可以不遵守宪法”，我认为这是胡说。中国共产党领导中国人民同内外敌人斗争了几十年，好容易才有了自己的宪法，怎么倒会自己不遵守呢？个别党员犯法是有的。但个别党员和全党不能划等号，这和有人借整风散布反党言论，不能否认多数人的善意批评，少数右派分子决不能代表广大的党外人士一样。
    说到民主，我想，共产党讲不讲民主，有没有民主不是少数右派分子信口可以抹煞的。对这部分人有民主，对另一部分人就没民主。中国如此，外国也如此。我感到有民主，和我一起工作的同志们感到有民主。如果问问工人，农民，他们就更感到有民主了。二位先生怎么感到没民主呢？要依二位苦心所写的文章的内容实质来衡量一下，还是没有先生们的民主的好。在人民的报刊上能刊登先生们的文章，民主范围就不小了。
    二位先生说政协把主要精力放在组织有关学习等问题的工作上，这是笑话。我看先生们的这段话才是笑话呢！学习有什么不好？！建设社会主义这是“协”的基础。学习马列主义，建立共同语言，才能“协”得来。否则就搞到相反的一边去了。何况政协还作了其他很多工作，报上才登过协商广西僮族自治区的建立，政协这些工作是谁也抹煞不了的。
    二位先生怕人家给戴上“反马列主义的铁帽”，自己却顶出了反社会主义的钢盔。先生们怕别人给扣上“莫须有罪名的手铐”，自己却发表了反社会主义的文章作为事实。请问：先生们要不要民主？要的话我先发言。这就是：反社会主义的坏家伙如果继续反上去，就只有将他们驱逐出教育阵地，再不给反共反人民的言论丝毫自由！
