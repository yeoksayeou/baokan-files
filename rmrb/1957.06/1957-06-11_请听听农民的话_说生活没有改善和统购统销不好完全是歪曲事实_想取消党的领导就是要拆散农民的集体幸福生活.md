Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th: Farmers from the Qunli Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Wuhan held a forum yesterday to discuss some of the erroneous remarks that have appeared in newspapers recently.

When the cooperative members discussed the issue of some people wanting the Communist Party to "step down," they indignantly questioned who exactly wanted to secretly "come to power"? They said that we peasants will never tolerate any exploiting elements stirring up trouble and ruling us again.

Huang Shidong, the cooperative's security section chief and a non-Party cadre, pointed out that people like Ge Peiqi saying that people's lives have not improved since liberation is a complete distortion of the facts. Huang Shidong used his own life as an example: his family used to have seven people, and his father and son worked for the landlord all year round, and still had to rely on borrowing high-interest loans to survive. Now his family has eleven people, and last year the family's total income was more than 1,400 yuan, with enough food grain left over, and more than a dozen new clothes were made.

Cai Hehai, the deputy director of the cooperative, introduced: 95% of the 276 cooperative members in our cooperative increased their income last year, and if compared with before liberation, their lives have improved by more than one or two times. Of course, there are also individual households who complain that their lives have deteriorated, such as former landlord elements, or people who live by gambling and speculation all year round.

Pan Lisheng, the captain of the livestock team, felt very angry about Ge Peiqi's complaint that the tight pork supply was caused by the state's unified purchase and sales policy. He said: We are still implementing the unified purchase and sales policy here, and our cooperative's pig production is developing very quickly. Now, in addition to more than 200 pigs raised collectively, cooperative members also raise more than 400 pigs individually, averaging three pigs per household. We now eat more meat in a month than we ate in a year before liberation.

When it came to the question of whether or not the Communist Party's leadership was needed in the future, everyone's emotions became even more agitated. From the liberation of Wuhan and the land reform to the cooperativization movement, they believed that without the Party's leadership, there would be no real liberation for the peasants; whoever plans to eliminate the Party's leadership means that some people still hope that one day they can take the land back from the peasants and dismantle the peasants' collective happy life. They especially mentioned the great and arduous flood control struggle in Wuhan in 1954. This cooperative is located at the foot of the Zhanggong Dyke, which is famous for its flood control struggle. During the Kuomintang rule, they had suffered the hardship of "Wuhan being flooded" (1931), with people displaced and families destroyed. Although the flood in 1954 was even more severe than that year, under the wise leadership of the Party, the people of the city were organized and finally defeated the flood; this agricultural cooperative was organized under the leadership of the Party during the flood control.

　　请听听农民的话
　　说生活没有改善和统购统销不好完全是歪曲事实
    想取消党的领导就是要拆散农民的集体幸福生活
    据新华社武汉10日电  武汉市郊区群力农业社农民昨天举行座谈会，讨论最近在报纸上出现的一些错误言论。
    社员们谈到有人要共产党“下台”的问题时，愤慨地质问究竟是谁想要偷偷摸摸地“上台”呢？他们说，我们农民决不会容忍任何剥削分子兴风作浪、再来统治我们。
    合作社保卫股长、非党干部黄世栋指出，葛佩琦等人说解放以来人民生活没有提高，完全是歪曲事实。黄世栋以自己的生活作为例证：他家从前七口人，父子俩终年给地主干活，还要靠着借高利贷过活。如今家里十一口人，去年全家总收入一千四百多元，留的口粮够吃有余，新衣做了十几套。
    合作社副主任蔡贺海介绍说：我们社二百七十六户社员，去年有95％的社员增加了收入，若是和解放以前对比，生活提高一两倍以上。当然，还有个别的户埋怨生活降低了，如过去的地主分子，或者常年以赌博、投机倒把为生的人。
    畜牧队队长潘厉生对于葛佩琦埋怨猪肉供应紧张是国家的统购统销政策造成的这些话，感到很生气。他说：我们这里仍在执行统购统销政策，而我们社里的生猪发展得也很快。现在除了集体养猪二百多头外，社员个人养猪也有四百多头，每户平均三头猪。现在我们一个月吃的肉，比解放前一年吃的还要多。
    谈到今后要不要共产党的领导问题，大家的情绪就更加激动。他们从武汉的解放、土地改革，谈到合作化运动，认为没有党的领导，就没有农民的真正翻身；谁要打算取消党的领导，就是意味着有人还希望有一天把土地从农民手里夺回去，把农民们集体的幸福生活拆散。他们特别提到1954年武汉市伟大而艰巨的防汛斗争。这个社正处在由防汛斗争而驰名的张公堤的脚下。在国民党统治时期，他们曾吃过“水淹武汉市”的苦头（1931年），人们流离失所，家破人亡。1954年的洪水虽然比那一年更凶猛，但是在党的英明领导下，组织全市人民最后战胜了洪水；这个农业社就是在防汛时在党的领导下组织起来的。
