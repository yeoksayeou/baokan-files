　　A Study of the "Rush Work, Idle Work Syndrome"
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Feng Jian
    Winter rush work and spring idle work have been chronic problems at basic construction sites in the Wuhan area for several years. What are its harms? Where are the roots of the disease? Is this an immutable objective law? What methods can be used to carry out construction in a balanced way? The following are some materials the reporter heard and saw at the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO).
    The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation is responsible for the construction project of WISCO. Before WISCO started construction, the builders undertook the expansion project of Daye Steel Plant and the construction project of Wuhan Thermal Power Plant starting in 1954. Over the past three years, the path experienced by this enterprise, in the words of the builders themselves, is: "The annual plan is set in winter, tight in the second half and loose in the first half, less task in the first, second, and third seasons, and recruit soldiers and buy horses to reach the peak in the fourth season." This is full of painful but valuable lessons.
    Looking back at the construction history of the past three years, the Wuhan Construction Corporation has been tight in the front and loose in the back every year, with uneven busy and idle periods. The spring of 1954 was okay, completing 20.2% of the annual plan; while the spring of 1955 and the spring of 1956 only completed 12.9% and 10.7%. In the past three years, every winter has been a peak of rush work, with the completed workload always around half of the annual plan. From January to April 1957, one-third of the year has passed, and only a little over one-fifth of the annual plan has been completed. It seems that rushing work in autumn and winter will become the established pattern again.
    The uneven busy and idle periods in spring and winter have created a vicious cycle: winter rush work forces enterprises to "recruit soldiers and buy horses," turning them into big fat men. The number of idle workers in the following spring also increases accordingly. Thus, rushing work this winter creates the cause for idle work next spring, and idle work this spring is the consequence of rushing work last winter. During the rush work in the winter of 1955, the company increased by an average of more than 1,800 people. During the rush work in the winter of 1956, it increased by an average of more than 10,400 people. Once the end of the year passed, the increased number of people aggravated the burden of idle work. Over the years, the number of machinery operators, hardware technicians, and construction technicians who have been idle for a long time or seasonally at the WISCO construction site has reached 2,600, not including temporary workers.
    The rush work and idle work of tens of thousands of people have brought many difficulties and problems to the enterprise:
    During the idle season, the state needs to spend a large sum of money to maintain the lives of employees. The idle work fees paid in 1955, when the idle work was most severe, amounted to 2.6 million yuan, enough to build a small factory. Not only did the state spend extra money, but construction workers could only get 80% to 85% of their wages during the idle period, and their living standards also decreased. Staff members of the Mechanical Installation No. 1 Company under the Wuhan Construction Corporation told reporters that since the establishment of their company three years ago, a large number of workers have been idle every year. The company had to find odd jobs outside, lending the workers to this owner for a few days and that owner for a few days. Some workers have never worked in the company for a single day in the past three years. Workers from Shanghai, Taiyuan, Northeast China, and other places with large families have living difficulties during the idle period and often make noise. The trade union has to provide relief. During the idle period, skilled workers are afraid of losing their skills, and those who want to learn skills cannot learn. Their ideological turmoil and distress cannot be calculated in numbers.
    During the "peak" season of rush work, the number of workers increases sharply, and everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to workers' dormitories, canteens, cinemas, shops, buses, bathrooms, and toilets becomes tense. In 1956, the WISCO construction site once carried out large-scale construction to build a living base, but the dormitories and residences were still insufficient. The newly established supply and marketing stores were lined up on the construction site, but they still could not fully meet the needs.
    Idle work and rush work, one loose and one tight, the deformed construction "law" has also disrupted the order of enterprise planning and management.
    WISCO is a very complex and arduous construction project. Its design drawings and machinery and equipment come from foreign countries and domestic sources. It requires about 5,000 kinds of building materials and thousands of large and small machines. Directing and organizing such a huge construction project, with harmonious and rhythmic construction, is an extremely complex and difficult task. Any obstacles from the left, right, above, below, and all directions, even a ton of steel, a drawing, or a machine, may affect the overall situation and cause idle work or rush work. There are many reasons for this. In addition to the consequences of the overly large plan last year, the builders also told reporters about the following aspects:
    First, some of the superior's systems are inappropriate and are controlled too tightly.
    The builders believe that the annual plan of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is set late and changes frequently. The 1955 plan was finalized in October, the 1956 plan was finalized in September, and the 1957 plan, although earlier, was not finalized until May.
    However, the construction period of a large workshop is generally more than one year, and it generally takes about two years for an order for equipment from abroad to arrive, and about one year for a domestic order. In this way, the annual construction plan arrives late and is disconnected from the state's fiscal year plan, which inevitably leads to: no work in spring - idle work; grabbing the plan in winter - rush work. Moreover, the plan for the following year cannot be connected.
    The builders proposed that in order to change the current situation, the annual plan should be prepared half a year in advance, and it is best to determine and announce the plan for the next year in the third quarter.
    In the process of implementing the national plan, the enterprise's power is very small. The State Construction Bank has very strict control over construction investment, so-called "money for oil is not allowed to buy vinegar, and money for buying vinegar is not allowed to buy oil." The general manager of the enterprise only has 500 yuan of financial power. The builders also mentioned that after they started expanding the open hearth furnace at the Daye Steel Plant, the Iron and Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry directed the construction from Beijing, pillar by pillar, stopping and starting at will, with material supply plans changing several times a day, leaving the on-site construction at a loss.
    The current material ordering system is also an obstacle to balanced construction. The system stipulates that construction materials for the spring of the following year should be ordered in November of the previous year, for the second quarter in February, and for the third and fourth quarters in May. However, construction materials need to go through a production process. According to the builders' calculations, it generally takes a quarter for materials to be ordered, produced, and transported to the construction site. This material ordering system requires that the materials produced in the current quarter be transported to the construction site for use in the current quarter, which is difficult to achieve. Therefore, when enterprises generally lack material reserves today, especially in the spring and summer of each year, work stoppage and waiting for materials become inevitable. In 1956, the Wuhan Construction Corporation wasted 15,000 workdays due to work stoppage and waiting for materials, not including large-scale idle work of more than one month. Since the beginning of this year, the No. 1 coke oven and residential building construction projects of WISCO have also been unable to proceed as planned due to waiting for materials. The builders often spread their hands helplessly and said: "The state has already allocated materials to us, and we have already ordered them, but these materials are still 'talking on paper' and are still being produced in steel plants, cement plants, and timber logging yards!"
    Second, the impact of design and equipment on construction.
    At the construction site, you can often see builders reaching out to the construction unit to urge for drawings and equipment, or even disputes arising from this. Often, the state's investment plan and construction progress have been determined, but the design and equipment have not been fully prepared. Sometimes, there is even an unusual phenomenon: first determine the completion date, push forward to calculate the start date, and then put forward the requirements for design and equipment. As a result, when the design and equipment are delayed, the workers become idle.
    Of the 128 individual projects constructed by the Wuhan Construction Corporation in 1955, more than half did not have a delivery date for the drawings, and the drawings were delivered one day to half a month before the start of construction. In 1956, there were 33 projects whose start date was delayed due to delayed design. A coordinate, a line, often requires repeated exchanges of documents without a decision. This year, the refractory material plant, which was the first to start construction at WISCO, was still designed domestically, but the delivery dates of several projects were delayed by two to four months compared with the plan. Among them, the shaft kiln project of the lime roasting workshop started excavation on April 1, but was ordered to stop work on April 13 due to design modifications, a stoppage of twelve days. According to the site director here, this design modification did save a batch of investment for the country, but the workers were idle for more than ten days, wasted more than 3,700 cubic meters of soil for nothing, wasted more than 800 workdays, and the processed steel bars had to be reprocessed, and the completion date may also be affected. He talked about the troubles brought to his work by the frequent changes in design in the past, saying: "We work a section and look at a section; we look at a section and work a section; we finish today's work, but we don't necessarily know what to do tomorrow."
    The failure of equipment to arrive on time also brings no small amount of difficulties to construction. The various production enterprises serving the mechanization and factory construction of WISCO were originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 1955 and put into production in January 1956, but due to incomplete equipment and other reasons, they were delayed again and again, and did not start production one after another until July 1. This year, the equipment needed by WISCO has not been ordered by May, and the installation engineering companies on the construction site cannot arrange much work, and will continue to be idle before this winter.
    Third, problems in construction organization.
    The team of the Wuhan Construction Corporation, like other large construction enterprises, began to gather from all over the country four years ago. Several engineering companies even moved to Wuhan with their entire team from thousands of miles away. Some of them are construction workers and some are installation workers.
    As everyone knows, any construction project has two major processes: construction and installation. From the perspective of the WISCO construction site, the construction workload is currently large, and the installation workers who have already gathered are idle in large numbers. When the installation work enters its peak in the future, the construction workers will lack work. The dispatch of construction teams on a national scale, crisscrossing and galloping north and south, brings many problems to construction organization. How to coordinate and connect construction projects and installation projects with each other so as not to be idle is worthy of deep thought.
    Whether the on-site collaboration is good or not also affects idle work and rush work. If the earthwork project, which serves as the "pioneer," is delayed, other units will follow suit and become idle. Similarly, if the progress of the civil construction project is delayed, the installation unit will follow suit and become idle. People hope that the construction site should be organized like a symphony orchestra, playing harmonious and pleasing music. Over the past few years, the Wuhan Construction Corporation has not been able to achieve this, and the lessons and losses in this regard are still considerable.

　　“赶工、窝工症”考
　　新华社记者  冯健
    冬季赶工、春季窝工，这是武汉地区基本建设工地几年来的老毛病。它有些什么危害？病根在那里？这是不是不可改变的客观规律？有什么办法能够均衡地进行建设？下面是记者在武钢建设工地听到、看到的一些材料。
    武钢建设工程由武汉冶金建筑总公司施工。在武钢开工以前，建设者们从1954年开始，承担了大冶钢厂扩建工程和武汉热电厂建设工程。三年来，这个企业经历的道路，用建设者们自己的话来说，是：“一年计划冬季定，后半紧来前半松，一、二、三季少任务，四季招兵买马上高峰。”这里面充满着辛酸的、然而却是宝贵的教训。
    翻开三年来的施工历史，武建总公司年年是前松后紧，闲忙不均。1954年春季还好，完成了全年计划的20.2％；而1955年春季和1956年春季，只完成了12.9％和10.7％。三年来每到冬季，都是赶工高峰陡耸，完成的工作量总在全年计划的一半上下。1957年1到4月，时间过去了一年的三分之一，也只完成了全年计划的五分之一强。看来秋、冬两季赶工，又将成为定局。
    春、冬季闲忙不均，造成了一种恶性循环症：冬季赶工，——企业不得不“招兵买马”，变成了个大胖子，——第二年春季窝工的人数也随之增加了。这样，今冬赶工造成明春窝工的前因，今春窝工是去冬赶工的后果。1955年冬季赶工，公司平均增加了一千八百多人，1956年冬季赶工，平均增加了一万零四百多人，等到年关一过，增加的人就加重了窝工的负担。经年累月，现在武钢工地长期窝工或季节性窝工的机械驾驶工、五金技工和建筑技工已达二千六百人，临时工还不计算在内。
    成千上万的人赶工、窝工，给企业带来了很多困难和问题：
    窝工季节，国家需要拿出一大笔钱，来维持职工生活。窝工最严重的1955年支付的窝工费，达二百六十万元，够盖一个小工厂了。不仅是国家额外花了钱，建筑工人窝工期只能拿到80％到85％的工资，生活水平也降低了。武建总公司所属机械安装一公司的工作人员，对记者谈到，他们公司成立三年来，年年有大批工人窝工，公司只好到外边找零活干，把工人给东家借几天，西家借几天，有的工人三年来从没有在公司里干过一天活。从上海、太原、东北等地来的工人，家口多的，窝工时生活困难，时常吵吵嚷嚷，工会还得给救济。窝工期间，有技术的工人怕技术丢生了，想学技术的学不到，他们思想上的动乱和苦恼，是无法用数字计算的。
    到了赶工的“高峰”季节，工人骤增，衣食住行，样样要办，工地上的工棚、宿舍、食堂、影剧院、商店、公共汽车以至浴室、厕所等等，跟着紧张起来。1956年武钢工地曾经大兴土木，修建生活基地，但宿舍住宅仍不敷分配，新增设的供应商店林立工地，也还不能充分满足需要。
    窝工、赶工，一松一紧，畸形的施工“规律”，把企业计划管理的秩序也打乱了。
    武钢是一个十分复杂、艰巨的建设工程。它的设计图纸、机器设备，有的来自国外，有的来自国内；它所需要的建筑材料有五千来种，大小机械上千百样；在工地同时施工的单位有几十个。指挥和组织这样巨大的建设工程，和谐而有节奏地施工，是一桩极其复杂、困难的事。来自左右上下、四方八面的任何障碍，哪怕是一吨钢材，一张图纸，一台机器，都有可能牵动全局，造成窝工或赶工。其中原因很多，除去去年计划偏大带来的后果以外，建筑者们还对记者谈到以下几个方面：
    第一，上级有些制度不当，统得又严又死。
    建设者们认为冶金工业部年度计划定得迟，变化多。1955年的计划10月才定案，1956年的计划9月才定案，1957年虽然提前了些，也是到5月才定局的。
    但是，建设一个较大的车间，工期一般都在一年以上，向国外订购一次设备，一般需两年左右才能到手，国内订货也得一年左右。这样，年度建设计划姗姗来迟，就跟国家的财政年度计划脱节了，势必造成：春季，没活干，——窝工；冬季，抢计划，——赶工。而且，翌年的计划也衔接不上了。
    建设者们提出，要想改变现状，年度计划应该提前半年编，最好在第三季确定和公布下一年的计划。
    在执行国家计划的过程中，企业的权力是很小的。国家建设银行对建设投资管得很死，所谓“打油的钱不准买醋，买醋的钱不准打油。”企业的总经理，只有五百元的财权。建设者们还谈到，他们在大冶钢厂开始扩建平炉后，重工业部钢铁局从北京一根柱子、一根柱子地指挥施工，朝行暮止，时断时续，材料供应计划甚至一天数变，弄得现场施工莫衷一是。
    现行的材料订货制度，也是均衡施工的一个障碍。制度规定：头年11月订第二年春季的建筑材料，2月订第二季的，5月订第三、四季的。但是，建筑材料需要经过一个生产过程。据建筑者们计算，材料从订货、生产到运进工地，一般需要一个季度。这样的材料订货制度，就是要求当季生产的材料，当季运到工地使用，这是很难做得到的。因此，当企业普遍缺乏材料储备的今天，特别是每年的春、夏两季，停工待料就成为不可避免的事。1956年，武建总公司因停工待料浪费了一万五千个工作日，一个月以上的大窝工还不包括在内。今年以来，武钢一号炼焦炉和住宅区建筑工程，也因为等待材料，不能按计划施工。建设者们常常无可奈何地摊开双手说：“国家已经给我们分配了材料，我们也已经订上货了，但是这些材料还是‘纸上谈兵’，还在钢铁厂、水泥厂、木材采伐场生产呢！”
    第二，设计、设备对于施工的影响。
    在工地时时可以看到建筑者向兴建单位伸手催图纸、催设备，甚或因而发生争执。往往是，国家的投资计划、施工进度已经确定了，设计、设备却还没有充分的准备。有时甚至出现一种异乎寻常的现象：先定下竣工期，向前推算出开工期，再提出设计、设备的要求。结果，当设计、设备拖迟，工人就窝工。
    1955年武建总公司施工的一百二十八个单位工程，有一半以上是没有交图日期和在开工前一天到半月才交图的；1956年，因设计推迟而拖延开工日期的工程有三十三项。一个座标，一条线路，也往往行文往返而不决。今年，武钢最先开工的耐火材料厂，还是国内设计的，但有好几项工程，交图日期比计划推迟了两个到四个月。其中的石灰焙烧车间竖窑工程，4月1日已经开工挖土，因为要修改设计，到4月13日命令停工，一停十二天。据这里的工地主任谈，这次修改设计，的确为国家节约了一批投资，但是，工人们窝了十几天工，白挖了三千七百多方土，浪费了八百多个工作日，已经加工的钢筋得重新处理，竣工期也可能要受影响。他谈起过去设计多变给工作带来的烦恼说：“我们是作一段，看一段；看一段，作一段；今天的工作完了，不一定晓得明天要作什么。”
    设备不能如期到达，给建设带来的困难也不算少。为武钢机械化，工厂化施工服务的各生产企业，原订1955年年底竣工，1956年1月投入生产，但是，由于设备不齐等等原因，一拖再拖，直到7月1日才陆续投入生产。今年武钢需要的设备，到5月还未订货，工地上各安装工程公司排不出多少活来，今年冬季以前将继续窝工。
    第三，施工组织上的问题。
    武建总公司的队伍，像其他大型建筑企业一样，四年前就开始从全国各地汇集而来。有几个工程公司还是从迢迢千里之外全班人马迁来武汉的。他们有的是建筑工人，有的是安装工人。
    大家知道，任何建设工程有建筑和安装两大工艺。从武钢工地来看，目前建筑工作量较大，已经集结起来的安装工人就成批的窝工；等将来安装工作进入高潮，建筑工人又缺活干了。建筑队伍像这样全国范围的遣兵调将，南北辗转驰骋，给施工组织带来了很多问题。怎样能使建筑工程和安装工程互相调剂，互相衔接，不致窝工，十分值得令人深思。
    施工现场协作得好不好，也影响到窝工、赶工。作为“开路先锋”的土方工程拖迟了，别的单位就会跟着窝工。同样地，土建工程进度拖迟了，安装单位就会跟着窝工。人们希望，建设工地应该组织得像一个交响乐团，演奏出和谐的、令人愉悦的乐曲；几年来，武建总公司还没有能做到这一点，这方面的教训和损失也还是不少的。
