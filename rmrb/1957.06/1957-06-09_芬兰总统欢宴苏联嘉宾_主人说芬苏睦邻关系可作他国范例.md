Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 8th: TASS reports from Helsinki: Finnish President Kekkonen hosted a banquet at his official residence on June 7th in honor of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Khrushchev.

At the banquet, President Kekkonen welcomed the Soviet guests' visit to Finland. He recounted the development of Finnish-Soviet friendship, particularly mentioning the late Finnish President Paasikivi, who laid the foundation for the foreign policy of Finnish-Soviet friendly cooperation. He said that in 1944, the Finnish people cautiously and anxiously embarked on this path. However, when they saw the Soviet Union unconditionally and consistently respecting Finland's independence and freedom, and wishing to establish friendly relations with Finland on this basis, doubts and misunderstandings were dispelled. Trust, mutual respect, and understanding gradually solidified.

He said that it is no exaggeration to say that in today's turbulent world, the good neighborly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union can be regarded as an example. The Finnish-Soviet good neighborly relations, which are developing in a positive direction, have not only brought benefits to our two countries but also to international consultation policies, especially in the Nordic region.

Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin spoke, thanking the President for his hospitality. He said that the special harmonious atmosphere arising from mutual understanding and trust between the Soviet Union and Finland has always been a characteristic of Soviet-Finnish talks. In each meeting, both sides fully understood each other and resolved the issues facing the two countries. Although both sides adhered to their principled positions during the talks, they found common ground that conformed to the interests of both countries.

Bulganin pointed out that the good neighborly relations between the two countries are not limited to generalities but are built on a realistic basis, continuously developing trade, economic cooperation, and cultural ties.

Finally, Bulganin handed President Kekkonen a personal letter from Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Voroshilov, inviting him to visit Moscow at his convenience.

    芬兰总统欢宴苏联嘉宾
    主人说芬苏睦邻关系可作他国范例
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰共和国总统吉科宁6月7日在自己的官邸设宴招待苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。
    吉科宁总统在宴会上表示欢迎苏联贵宾的访问芬兰。他追述了芬苏两国友谊发展的经过，他特别提到奠定芬苏友好合作外交政策基础的已故芬兰总统巴锡基维。他说，在1944年的时候，芬兰的人们是胆怯地、怀着忧虑地走上了这条道路的。但是，当他们看见苏联无条件地、一贯地尊重芬兰的独立和自由，并且希望在这个基础上和芬兰建立友好关系，于是，怀疑和误解就消除了。信任、相互尊重和谅解逐渐巩固了。
    他说，我们可以毫不夸大地说，在现今动荡不安的世界上，芬兰和苏联的睦邻关系可以算作范例。向着良好方向发展的芬兰和苏联的睦邻关系，不仅为我们两国带来了好处，同样地也为国际协商政策，特别是在北欧的国际协商政策，带来了好处。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁讲话，感谢总统的盛意。他说，苏芬两国互相谅解和信任而产生的那种特别融洽气氛，一贯是苏芬双方会谈的特点。在每一次会谈中，彼此都非常了解，解决了两国面前的问题。虽然在会谈中，双方都抱定自己的原则性的立场，但是双方都找到了符合两国利益的共同准绳。
    布尔加宁指出，两国的善邻关系没有限于泛泛之谈，而是把这种关系建筑在现实的基础上，不断发展贸易、经济合作和文化联系。
    最后，布尔加宁把苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫的一封私人信交给吉科宁总统，这封信邀请他在方便的时候到莫斯科去作客。
