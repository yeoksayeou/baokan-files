　　College Admissions Must Be Subject to Regional Allocation
　　Gao Mingshou
    Many candidates do not fully understand the issues regarding the regional scope of college admissions and the allocation of new students. Based on my understanding from the National College Entrance Examination Committee, I would like to share my views on this matter.
    In previous years, due to insufficient student sources and the extreme imbalance between the geographical distribution of colleges and the sources of students, planned allocation of admitted students was implemented between regions to comprehensively ensure the quantity and quality of new student enrollment. This involved defining the admissions regions for each school and the range of schools (regions) candidates could apply to. This approach enabled colleges in regions with larger enrollment quotas but insufficient student sources to admit enough students while maintaining a certain level of quality. It also provided more opportunities for candidates in regions with smaller enrollment quotas but abundant student sources to pursue higher education. For instance, in 1955, colleges in the Northwest region had an enrollment plan of 5,965 students, but only 6,456 candidates applied. After subject examinations, only 3,621 met the admission criteria, leaving a shortfall of 2,344 students. In the same year, colleges in the East China region had an enrollment plan of 26,575 students, while the number of applicants reached as high as 56,559. After subject examinations, 36,621 candidates met the admission criteria, exceeding the region's total enrollment plan by 10,046 students. It is evident from the above situation that without planned allocation between regions, colleges in the Northwest region would inevitably fail to meet their enrollment plans, while many qualified candidates in the East China region would be unable to enter higher education. After allocation, both the quality of admitted students and the completion of enrollment plans were ensured.
    Perhaps some may ask whether regional allocation is necessary under a unified enrollment system. Is it possible to not define the admissions regions for each college or specify the schools (regions) candidates can apply to? We believe that, under the national unified enrollment system, such planned allocation is necessary. Otherwise, if the admissions regions for schools are not defined, and candidates are not restricted in the schools (regions) they can apply to, the following problems will inevitably arise: First, there will be a large flow of admitted students. Each college may enroll candidates from several provinces and cities, several regions, or even across the country. If a large number of candidates from certain regions apply to colleges in other regions, then colleges in those regions will have to go to other regions to recruit new students. This would not only cause a waste of manpower and resources but also, because many students would be studying in other places, their unfamiliarity with local customs and living conditions would inevitably affect their studies, and job assignments after graduation would also be difficult. This impact is particularly serious for higher normal, agricultural and forestry, and medical colleges that primarily train cadres for their own provinces and cities. Second, candidates would concentrate on applying to a few schools and majors in a few regions, which would inevitably increase the difficulty of school admissions. At the same time, candidates from less developed regions would be unwilling to apply to schools in their own regions, and students from other regions would also be unwilling to apply to schools in these regions. As a result, schools in these regions would not be able to complete their enrollment plans, affecting the comprehensive realization of the national cadre training plan.
    The national allocation plan for admitted students is formulated based on the candidates' choices and the following factors: First, the ratio of enrollment plans to student sources in each region; second, the principle of local recruitment, with colleges trying to enroll as many students from their own regions as possible, and considering the imbalance in economic and educational foundations in each region, the admission standards for subject examinations should also be adapted to local conditions; third, in view of the differences in climate and living habits in each region, the allocation should avoid excessive, long-distance, and reciprocal flows between regions as much as possible. In addition, the historical relationships between regions (provinces and cities) and the historical traditions of college admissions should also be appropriately considered.
    In previous years of admissions, although student sources were insufficient and there was a great imbalance between enrollment plans and student sources in each region, the quality of admitted students was basically guaranteed, and the enrollment plans were completed through such planned allocation. Students admitted to schools in other regions generally adapted to the local environment, overcame difficulties, and studied with peace of mind. However, there were also some shortcomings in this work, the main one being that the principle of local recruitment was not well implemented. Admitting schools often emphasized recruiting new students with better academic quality and were unwilling to enroll more students from their own regions. For example, the Northwest region has historically had fewer student sources, so it has had to import a large number of students from several southern provinces with more student sources. These students experienced certain impacts on their studies due to their unfamiliarity with living conditions after entering school. Furthermore, due to the one-sidedness of some schools' admissions publicity, many students lacked ideological preparation, which led to serious unease in studying and even individual students dropping out of school. Secondly, necessary restrictions were not made between provinces and cities, and there was an unreasonable reciprocal flow between provinces and cities (of course, not all reciprocal flows are unreasonable). For example, in 1956, Henan Normal College admitted candidates from Tianjin, while Tianjin Normal College admitted candidates from Henan. These shortcomings have been addressed and improved in this year's admissions work by adopting corresponding measures.
    This year, in order to further implement the principle of local recruitment, the following main principles have been put forward in the admissions regulations regarding the scope of admissions for each college:
    1. Higher normal, agricultural, and medical colleges that mainly train cadres for their own provinces and cities should, in principle, enroll students from their own provinces and cities. 2. Peking University and six other schools enroll students from all over the country. Defense industry, diplomatic, and other colleges with special professional circumstances that require enrollment from other places may enroll students from across the country or from some regions. 3. The remaining colleges should, in principle, enroll students within the original Greater Administrative Region. 4. Some colleges in North China and Northwest China may enroll some students in East China and Central South China, and colleges in Northwest China and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces may also enroll some students in Sichuan Province.
    The National College Entrance Examination Committee will make specific regulations on which schools enroll students from all over the country, which schools only enroll students from their own provinces and cities, and which schools enroll students from their own regions. These regulations will be announced to candidates by the admissions committees of each region so that candidates can understand these situations and choose their college preferences realistically.
    This year, the national college enrollment plan is 107,000 students, while the estimated number of this year's high school graduates (including graduates of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools), who are the main source of candidates, is over 190,000. The comparison between the planned enrollment of colleges in each region and the source of students is very unbalanced. For example, East China and Central South China have more student sources, greatly exceeding the enrollment needs of colleges in those regions, while Northwest China's student sources are far from meeting the enrollment needs of the region. Without planned allocation, even if colleges in the Northwest region admit all candidates indiscriminately, they will not be able to complete their enrollment plans, while a large number of candidates in East China and Central South China will not be able to be admitted to schools. Therefore, planned allocation must be carried out.
    According to the preliminary regional allocation plan (draft) formulated by the National College Entrance Examination Committee: Some colleges in North China will recruit some new students in East China, Central South China and other regions (provinces); some colleges in Northwest China will recruit some new students in East China, Central South China and other regions (provinces). We believe that such allocation is necessary and reasonable this year. Therefore, we hope that candidates can correctly understand this practical situation and choose their college preferences realistically based on the idea of "going to school for the comprehensive needs of the motherland" and overcoming difficulties. We also hope that colleges enrolling students in other regions can also be realistic and responsible to the candidates, by explaining both the advantages and the difficulties of their region (school). They should provide more detailed information to candidates about the living conditions in the location of the school, so that they can be prepared ideologically and study with peace of mind after entering school.

　　高等学校招生必须进行地区调配
　　高明寿
    关于高等学校招生的地区范围及录取新生的调配问题，有很多考生不够了解，现在根据我从全国高等学校招生工作委员会所了解到的情况，谈谈我对这一问题的看法。
    以往几年，高等学校招生，由于学生来源不足，高等学校的地区分布与学生来源之间极不平衡，为了全面地保证录取新生的数量和质量，在地区之间对录取新生采取了有计划的调配，规定了各校的招生地区范围及考生的报考学校（地区）范围，这样既可使那些招生任务较大，而学生来源不足地区的高等学校，能够在保证一定质量的条件下录取足额，同时也可以使那些本区招生任务较小，而学生来源较多的地区的考生，有更多的升学机会。例如，1955年西北地区各高等学校的招生计划为5，965人，而报考人数只有6，456人，经过学科考试以后，仅有3，621人合于录取条件，尚缺2，344人。同年，华东地区各高等学校的招生计划为26，575人，报考人数却达56，559人之多，经学科考试以后，有36，621人合于录取条件，超过该区各校招生计划10，046人。由上述情况很显然可以看出，如果在地区之间不作有计划的调配，势必是西北地区各校完不成招生计划，而华东地区却有很多合于录取条件的考生不能升入高等学校。经过调配以后，既保证了招收新生的质量，又全面地完成了招生计划。
    也许会有人问统一招生是否必须进行地区调配呢？可不可以不划定各高等学校的招生地区范围，也不规定考生报考的学校（地区）范围呢？我们认为，在全国统一招生的情况下，这种有计划地调配是必要的，否则，不划定学校的招生地区范围，也不规定考生报考的学校（地区）范围，必然会发生以下几个问题：第一、录取新生将大量的流动，每一所高等学校都有可能招收几个省市、几个地区甚至全国各地的考生，如果某些地区有大批的考生报考外区的高等学校，那么，这些地区的高等学校就不得不到其他地区去招收新生。这不仅会造成人力物力的浪费，而且由于很多的学生到外地求学，对异地的风俗习惯以及生活条件不相适应，必然会影响到他们的学习，将来毕业以后，分配工作也会发生困难。这种影响尤其是对于那些主要为本省、市培养干部的高等师范、农林、医药院校则更为严重。第二、考生会集中地报考少数地区的少数学校和专业，这就必然会增加学校录取的困难。同时，条件较差的地区的考生不愿报考本区的学校，而外区的学生也不愿意报考这些地区的学校，结果这些地区的学校就不能完成招生计划，影响国家培养干部计划的全面实现。
    全国的录取新生调配计划，是在考生志愿的基础上，根据以下几方面的因素制定的：第一、是各地区的招生计划与各该地区学生来源的比例；第二、是以就地取才为原则，各高等学校尽量多录取本地区的学生，考虑到各地区的经济和教育基础的不平衡，因而学科考试成绩的录取标准也要因地制宜；第三、鉴于各地区的气候及生活习惯等不同，在录取调配时，尽量避免调得过多、过远以及地区之间对流等现象。此外，也应适当地照顾到各地区（省市）的历史关系和高等学校招生的历史传统。
    以往几年招生，虽然学生来源不足，各地区的招生计划与学生来源之间的极不平衡，但是，经过这样的计划调配以后，基本上保证了录取新生的质量，完成了招生计划。录取到外区学校的学生，一般的都能自觉地适应当地环境，克服困难，安心学习。但是，在这项工作中也存在着若干缺点，其中主要的是对就地取才的原则，未能得到很好的贯彻。招生学校往往强调录取质量较好的新生，而不肯多录取本地区的学生。如西北地区历年来学生来源较少，于是便不得不从学生来源较多的南方几省输入大量的学生，这些学生入学后由于生活条件的不相适应，学习上受到了一定的影响；还由于有些学校在招生宣传时的片面性，使许多学生缺乏思想准备，因此在入学后曾发生严重的不安心学习，甚至个别学生自动退学的现象。其次是在省市之间未作必要的限制，存在着省市之间不合理的对流现象（当然不是所有的对流现象都是不合理的）。如1956年河南师范学院就录取了天津的考生，而天津师范学院又录取了河南的考生。这些缺点，在今年的招生工作中都采取了相应的措施，加以改进。
    今年，为了进一步贯彻就地录取的原则，在招生规定中，对各高等学校的招生地区范围问题，提出了以下几条主要原则：
    一、主要为本省市培养干部的高等师范、农科、医药院校，原则上应该招收本省市的学生。二、北京大学等七校在全国各地招生。国防工业、外交性质高等学校和其他因专业情况特殊，需要到外地招生的学校，可以在全国或部分地区招生。三、其余高等学校原则上应当在原大行政区范围内招生。四、华北、西北地区的部分高等学校，可以在华东、中南地区招收部分学生，西北地区及云南、贵州两省的高等学校还可以在四川省招收一部分学生。
    至于哪些学校在全国各地招生，哪些学校只在本省市招生，哪些学校在本地区招生，全国高等学校招生委员会将作具体规定，并将由各地区的招生工作委员会向考生公布，以便使考生了解这些情况以后，实事求是地选择升学志愿。
    今年，全国高等学校计划招生十万七千人，而作为考生主要来源的今年高中毕业生（包括今年工农速成中学毕业生），估计有十九万多人。各地区高等学校计划招生人数与学生来源的比较是很不平衡的，例如：华东、中南地区的学生来源较多，大大地超过了该地区高等学校招生的需要，而西北地区的学生来源则远不能满足该区的招生需要。如果不经过计划调配，西北地区高等学校即使将全部考生毫无选择地如数录取，也完不成招生计划，而华东、中南地区则将有大量的考生考不取学校。因此，就必须要进行有计划的调配。
    根据全国高等学校招生委员会所拟制的初步地区调配方案（草案）中规定：华北地区的部分高等学校将在华东、中南等地区（省）招收一部分新生；西北地区的部分高等学校将在华东、中南等地区（省）招收一部分新生。我们认为，今年进行这样的调配是必要的、合理的。因此，希望考生能够正确地理解这种实际情况，在“为祖国的全面需要而升学”和克服困难的思想基础上，实事求是地选择自己的升学志愿。并且希望在外区招生的高等学校，也能够本着实事求是，向考生负责的精神，既要宣传本地区（本校）的有利条件，也要讲清困难。对学校所在地的生活条件等，应向考生作比较详尽的介绍，以便使他们在思想上有所准备，入学后能够安心学习。
