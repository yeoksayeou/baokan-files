Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: The "Washington Star" published an article by Brown on May 31st stating that "To trade, not to play the hero" seems to be the new slogan of the Western "free nations." Brown said that the favorable prospects of trading with countries of the socialist camp "stimulated a trend towards peaceful coexistence." Western countries are striving to pursue this prospect, even at the risk of undermining the foundations of the "free world." This American commentator said that, tempted by the lure of "huge trade possibilities" with socialist countries, America's Western allies and Japan are "desperately" seizing these "possibilities." And the United States is caught in the middle. He said that the United States is now in a position of being forced to accept the trend towards coexistence.

Brown concluded by saying: "To trade, not to play the hero" seems to be the new slogan of the Western "free nations." He said that this theory has become clear just this week. We have tried to persuade Britain and Japan with all sorts of reasons not to restore almost unrestricted trade with Communist China. However, our reasons have been ignored.

    “自由世界”同床异梦
    美国的盟国倾向和平共处
    “华盛顿明星报”忧心忡忡
    据新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿明星报”5月31日刊载布朗的一篇文章说，“要买卖，而不要逞英雄”看来是西方“自由国家”的新口号。布朗说，同社会主义阵营各国进行贸易的有利前景“刺激了走向和平共处的趋势”，西方国家正在竭力追求这种前景，那怕冒破坏“自由世界”基础的危险。这个美国评论员说，由于同社会主义国家进行“巨大贸易的可能性”的诱惑，美国的西方盟国和日本正在“拼命”抓住这种“可能性”。而美国则被夹在中间。他说，美国现在正处于被迫接受走向共处的趋势的境地。
    布朗最后说：“要买卖，而不要逞英雄”看来是西方“自由国家”的新口号。他说，仅在本星期就清楚地表明了这种理论。我们已经设法用一切理由来说服英国和日本，不要恢复对共产党中国几乎无限制的贸易。可是，我们的理由被置之不理。
