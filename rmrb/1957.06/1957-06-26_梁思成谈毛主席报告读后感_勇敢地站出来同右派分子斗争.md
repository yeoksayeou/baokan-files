　　Editor's Note: On June 25th, Dagong Bao published a reporter's interview with architect Liang Sicheng. The following is a reprint:

　　Last Sunday, the preparatory meeting of the National People's Congress. The reporter visited the architect Liang Sicheng, a delegate, at Tsinghua University. In his quiet little living room, Mr. Liang spoke freely about his thoughts after reading Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

　　Mr. Liang said that in the past, he had read "On Contradiction" many times, but his understanding was very abstract and dogmatic. He first heard Chairman Mao's speech on February 27th, then listened to the recording, and now he has read the full text of the speech. He felt that this report combined our domestic specific situation with Marxist-Leninist theory so vividly, explaining many important principles in a simple and profound way. He was grateful to Chairman Mao for giving him such an excellent political textbook. In particular, the six criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao, he said, gave him the most sharp weapon to carry out the "Hundred Schools of Thought" and conduct ideological struggle.

　　To Distinguish Right from Wrong, One Must Transform One's Worldview

　　Mr. Liang said: "The internal contradictions in various aspects mentioned in Chairman Mao's speech are, in the final analysis, a matter of distinguishing right from wrong. Specifically for intellectuals, it is a matter of transforming one's worldview, replacing bourgeois ideology with Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao said: 'The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation, and most intellectuals cannot yet be said to have completed this transformation.' Here, Chairman Mao put forward the words: 'Hope that intellectuals continue to move forward.' This is indeed very important, very important, for intellectuals."

　　Mr. Liang said with emotion: "When the rectification campaign first started, I was very naive, thinking that it was inevitable that intellectuals across the country would have bourgeois ideas in their minds. However, I thought that everyone would be in favor of the Communist Party and want to take the road of socialism. Who knew that after a short period of airing opinions, so many rightists emerged, and they clamored for the Communist Party to step down and wanted to replace it themselves. At this time, so-called senior intellectuals like me—actually flowers in a greenhouse who have not been tempered by real struggle—were greatly surprised: Ah, things are not simple! Only then did I realize that my past understanding of many issues was always so general, abstract, and lacked a keen political sense. For example, Chairman Mao said that some intellectuals still doubt or disagree with socialism. This part of the people only accounts for a minority. I very abstractly viewed this 'minority,' thinking that a small number could not play any bad role. Now, looking at it, just a few people among the 'minority,' such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, have spread so many anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. Things are not as calm as I originally imagined. The class struggle in ideology is going on fiercely!"

　　The Six Criteria Put Forward by Chairman Mao are the Most Effective Weapons

　　"Therefore, recently, I have especially felt that my political level is too low!" Mr. Liang continued: "Many contradictions are placed there, but I can't see the problem, or if I see something, I can't raise it to the theoretical level. Isn't this a low political level? In the past, Luo Longji said that the Party should visit intellectuals' thatched cottages three times. I didn't like the sound of it, but I just felt that he lacked a sense of ownership. After reading 'Grass and Wood,' I also felt uncomfortable, but I only felt that the author was too self-admiring and detached from the masses. Even this time, when Zhang Bojun raised the issue of the 'Political Design Institute,' I didn't grasp the key point politically at the time. At first, I just felt that he wanted to go beyond the National People's Congress to become a bigger official, and later I saw that this behavior was unconstitutional. Finally, I realized that this was a conspiracy to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and seize leadership.

　　"Now, I have figured out the minds of rightists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Next is to bravely stand up and launch a face-to-face struggle with the rightists. I ask myself if I have this determination and courage. However, I lack the ability to use weapons to argue reasonably, convince people with reason, and more effectively strike at the rightists. Speaking of weapons, we are not lacking. Marxism-Leninism and the six criteria recently put forward by Chairman Mao are the most effective and latest weapons. However, we, especially intellectuals like me, lack struggle experience, and in the past, we were not strict with ourselves. A few sweet words from people with ulterior motives, truths and lies mixed, reality and fiction intertwined, and we feel that we lack the capital, just like knowing where the machine gun is, but not knowing how to fire it. Therefore, in the past few days, I have never felt so urgently that intellectuals must grasp ideological transformation and learn Marxism-Leninism well in order to temper themselves in the struggle!"

　　Continuing Ideological Transformation is the Only Way to Become a Red Expert

　　Mr. Liang put forward his own views on the saying currently circulating among some intellectuals—"Small intellectuals lead big intellectuals." He said: "I don't agree with this statement. Knowledge has two kinds: knowledge of class struggle and knowledge of struggle against nature. The so-called intellectuals, like me, for example, how much knowledge we have in our minds is a question worth studying. In terms of struggling against nature, each of us only understands a little bit in a small department of the entire accumulation of knowledge. As for the knowledge of class struggle, we people basically cannot talk about having any 'level.' Among the five million intellectuals in the country, I am afraid that they are all still in kindergarten, and only a few can go to the first or second grade of elementary school. Explaining 'knowledge' in this way, people like us are at best only one-sided intellectuals.

　　"However, in the cruel class struggle, the leading comrades of the Party have been actually tempered for thirty or forty years and have undergone severe life tests. They are high-level intellectuals in class struggle. Now, after they have led the class struggle to victory, they are leading us to struggle against nature. This is big intellectuals leading small intellectuals. After these few years of transformation, we are at most just a little pink, far from being red experts. Without continuing to move forward and continuing ideological transformation, we cannot live up to the names of 'advanced' and 'big' intellectuals. As for people like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, even though they have one or two American degrees, they have no knowledge of the struggle against nature. As for the knowledge of class struggle, if they have any, I am afraid it is the knowledge of the bourgeoisie fighting against the proletariat! What kind of intellectuals are they? I hope they will answer it themselves."

### 梁思成谈毛主席报告读后感  勇敢地站出来同右派分子斗争

　　梁思成谈毛主席报告读后感
    勇敢地站出来同右派分子斗争
　　编者注：6月25日大公报发表了记者对建筑学家梁思成的访问记。现转载如下：
    星期天，全国人民代表大会预备会议体会。记者到清华园去访问了建筑学家梁思成代表。在他的幽静的小客厅里，梁先生畅谈了他读过毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文章以后的感想。
    梁先生说，过去他读过多少遍矛盾论，但都体会得很抽象，很教条。2月27日第一次听过毛主席的讲演，跟着又听了录音，现在又读了演说的全文。他感到这个报告把我们国内的具体情况和马列主义的理论这样生动地结合起来，深入浅出地讲清了许多重要的道理。他感激毛主席给了他这样一部最好的政治课本。特别是毛主席指出的那六项标准，他说那是给了他一个开展百家争鸣、进行思想斗争的最锐利的武器。
    要分清是非就得转变世界观
    梁先生说：“毛主席的演说里所提到的各方面的内部矛盾，归根到底，都是一个分清是非的问题。具体到知识分子身上来，就是转变世界观，以马克思列宁主义，代替资产阶级的思想改造问题。毛主席说：‘世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。’在这儿，主席提出了：‘希望知识分子继续前进’的话。这对知识分子来说，确实是很重要、很重要的。”
    梁先生感慨地说：“整风刚开始的时候，我还很天真，以为全国的知识分子，脑子里有资产阶级思想的人嘛，当然是在所难免的。可是，拥护共产党，要走社会主义的道路大概大家都是没有问题的。哪知道刚鸣了一阵子，就鸣出那么些右派分子来了，而且口口声声叫共产党下台，自己要取而代之。这时候，像我这样的所谓高级知识分子——其实是没有经过真正斗争锻炼的温室里的花——才感到大吃一惊：啊，事情可不简单呀！这才明白自己过去对许多问题的认识总是那么笼统、抽象和缺乏敏锐的政治嗅觉。譬如毛主席说过知识分子中间有一些人现在仍然怀疑或者不同意社会主义。这部分人只占少数。我就很抽象地看待这个‘少数’，以为小小数字起不了什么坏作用了。现在一看，只有章伯钧、罗隆基几个‘少数’中的少数人就散布了那么多反党、反社会主义的谬论。事情决不像我原先设想的那么风平浪静。思想上的阶级斗争正在激烈地进行着呢！”
    毛主席提出的六项标准是最有效的武器
    “所以，最近以来，我特别感到自己的政治水平太低了！”梁先生接着说：“许多矛盾摆在那儿，就是看不出来问题，或是看出点什么来，又提不到理论的高度，这不是政治水平低是什么？过去，罗隆基说过党要对知识分子三顾茅庐，我听着不顺耳，但只是感到他太缺乏主人翁思想罢了。看过‘草木篇’以后，我也曾觉得不是味儿，但也止于觉得那位作者太孤芳自赏，脱离群众罢了。甚至这次章伯钧提出什么‘政治设计院’的问题，我当时也没从政治上抓住要害。起初只觉得他这是想越过全国人民代表大会去做更大的官，后来又看出这种行为是违反宪法的。最后才弄清楚这是反党、反社会主义、争夺领导权的阴谋。
    “现在，章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子的心思我算是看出来了。跟着就是应该勇敢地站出来，同右派分子展开面对面的斗争。我自问有这份决心和勇气。但是，怎样据理力争，以理服人，更有力地打击右派分子，我就缺乏运用武器的能力。谈到武器，我们是并不缺乏的，马克思列宁主义和毛主席最近提出的六项标准都是最有效的最新式的武器。可是，我们，特别像我这样的知识分子，因为缺乏斗争经验，过去要求自己又不严格，别有用心的人几句花言巧语，真话假说，虚虚实实，我们就感到本钱不足，就像知道机关枪在哪儿，却不会放一样了，因此，这几天，我从来都没有这样迫切地感到：知识分子必须抓紧思想改造，要学好马列主义，才能在斗争中锻炼自己！”
    继续思想改造才能成为红色专家
    梁先生对目前流传在某些知识分子当中的说法——“小知识分子领导大知识分子”，提出了他自己的看法。他说：“我不同意这种说法。知识有阶级斗争的知识和向自然作斗争的知识两种。所谓知识分子，就譬如像我这样的人吧，我们头脑里的知识究竟有多少，就是个值得研究的问题。对向自然作斗争的方面，我们每个人所懂得的也不过在全部知识积累中对一个小小部门略有一知半解而已，至于阶级斗争的知识，我们这些人就根本谈不到有什么‘水平’了。全国五百万知识分子，恐怕还都在幼儿园里，能上初小一、二年级的恐怕仅是寥寥数人而已。这样来解释‘知识’，像我们这样的人充其量也不过是一个片面的知识分子而已。
    “但是，在残酷的阶级斗争中，党的领导同志们经过三、四十年实际的锻炼，受过严峻的生活的考验，他们才是阶级斗争的高级知识分子。现在，他们在领导阶级斗争取得胜利以后，又来领导我们向大自然作斗争，这是大知识分子来领导小知识分子。我们，经过这几年的改造，充其量不过刚刚有点粉红色，离红色专家还远得很呢。不继续前进，不继续思想改造，是不能和‘高级’、‘大’知识分子的称呼名符其实的。至于章伯钧、罗隆基之流，尽管他们有那么一两个美国的学位。他们对向自然斗争的知识是没有的。至于阶级斗争的知识，假如有一点的话，恐怕是资产阶级对无产阶级斗争的知识吧！这又算是哪一种知识分子呢？我倒希望他们自己答复一下。”
