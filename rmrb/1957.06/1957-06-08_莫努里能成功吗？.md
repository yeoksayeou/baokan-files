After a week of intense cabinet formation activities, Flimlin, the leader of the Republican Party, announced his failure. French President Coty is once again busy searching for a new Prime Minister candidate. The recently resigned Mollet was invited to the Élysée Palace, but he still refused the appointment to form a new government. Next to be summoned was the Radical Socialist René Billères, who also declined to accept the task. Finally, someone expressed willingness to undertake this thorny mission: Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, the former Minister of Defense in the Mollet cabinet and a Radical Socialist.

Shortly after Mollet's resignation, Bourgès-Maunoury said that France's current political crisis seemed like "a jigsaw puzzle with no pieces that fit together." Why is he now risking failure to try to piece together a cabinet?

It turns out that the conservatives and socialists are currently deadlocked, neither willing to yield. The Socialist Party, naturally, is unwilling to accept the task of forming a cabinet because of the conservatives' sabotage, insisting that the conservatives accept their conditions. The right wing, without the support of the Socialist Party, cannot muster the parliamentary majority needed to take power. Bourgès-Maunoury, as a member of the former Mollet government, has been associated with the Socialist Party; his active support for the policy of armed suppression in Algeria and the Common Market plan has also won him the appreciation of the right wing. With these assets, he attempts to maneuver between the left and right, gaining the support of both the Socialist Party and the conservatives to take the stage.

However, Bourgès-Maunoury faces considerable difficulties. First, his own party is already in a state of division. Mendès-France's proposal to change the current Algerian policy has gained the support of the vast majority within the Radical Socialist Party. Second, the Socialist Party has announced that it will only support a new government that continues to implement Mollet's old policies. If Bourgès-Maunoury takes over Mollet's Algerian policy and tax increase plan unchanged, he will, like Mollet, face simultaneous opposition from the left and right.

Political observers in Paris have adopted a reserved attitude towards the success of Bourgès-Maunoury's cabinet formation. It remains to be seen what cards Bourgès-Maunoury can play.

    莫努里能成功吗？
    袁先禄
    人民共和党领袖弗林姆兰在进行了一个星期的紧张的组阁活动之后，宣告失败了。法国总统戈蒂又为物色新总理人选而忙碌起来。刚刚辞职的摩勒被请进了爱丽舍宫，但是他仍然拒绝组织新政府的任命。接着被召见的是激进社会党人雷纳·毕埃尔，他也不愿意接受这项工作。最后，终算有人表示愿意承办这件棘手的差使了，他是原摩勒内阁中的国防部长，激进社会党人莫里斯·布歇—莫努里。
    在摩勒辞职后不久，布歇—莫努里曾经说过：法国的这次政治危机好像是“一副没有一块能凑得起来的益智分合图”。为什么现在他却甘冒失败的危险出来试图拼凑一个内阁呢？
    原来，目前保守派和社会党之间争持不下，各不相让。社会党固然因为保守派拆台，现在非要保守派接受条件不愿接受组阁任务，而右派没有社会党的支持又拼凑不起上台所需的议会多数。布歇—莫努里是原摩勒政府的成员，同社会党结过姻缘；他积极支持在阿尔及利亚实行武装镇压政策和共同市场计划的态度又颇受右派的赞赏。凭着这些资本，他企图左右逢源，得到社会党和保守派双方的支持而登台。
    但是，摆在布歇—莫努里面前的困难是不少的。首先，他所属的政党已经陷于分裂状态，孟戴斯—弗朗斯要求改变现行阿尔及利亚政策的主张，在激进社会党内得到了极大多数的支持。其次，社会党已经宣布它只支持仍然执行摩勒的老政策的新政府，如果布歇—莫努里把摩勒的阿尔及利亚政策和增税计划原封不动地接过来就会像摩勒一样，受到来自左面和右面的同时反对。
    巴黎的政治观察家对布歇—莫努里组阁的成功机会采取了保留的态度。现在要看布歇—莫努里能够拿出什么牌来。
