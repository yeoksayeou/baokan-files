Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: The Secretary-General of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, continued to invite non-Party members to a forum in the afternoon of the 3rd and 4th.

    Yu Suixin believes that the many layers of state organs are the root of bureaucracy.

    Yu Suixin, a Counselor of the State Council, spoke about the issue of democratic centralism. He believes that there are too many layers in state organs. The State Council's instructions pass through more layers to reach the grassroots than an eighteen-story pagoda. This is a strong root of bureaucracy. There is also departmentalism in various departments, with mutual buck-passing. Because there are too many and too large organs, they are too strict with the lower levels. The higher levels are busy with arrangements, conveying messages, holding meetings, and printing documents all day long, and the problems that need to be solved urgently at the lower levels cannot be resolved quickly. There are also too many non-production personnel in factories and enterprises. For example, in a factory with six hundred people, there are nearly one hundred and seventy management personnel, which increases production costs and creates bureaucracy. Yu Suixin suggested that the central government decentralize some powers to local governments so that many problems can be resolved quickly locally. As power is decentralized, many people in upper-level institutions can also be decentralized.

    Lin Zhijun believes that the codification work is progressing too slowly; the practice of replacing laws with official letters must be abolished.

    Lin Zhijun, a Counselor of the State Council, focused on legal issues in his speech. He believes that if people are to abide by the law, there must be laws. At present, our codification work is progressing too slowly, and official letters are used to replace laws in many areas, which must be abolished. He believes that drafting provisional regulations is better than using official letters and does not contradict the Constitution. He also criticized the lack of importance attached to the lawyer system and suggested that street-level cadres should be given attention, encouragement, and living allowances.

    Luo Ziwei offers ten opinions on the work of the State Council.

    Luo Ziwei, who works in the Central Handicraft Administration, put forward ten opinions on the work of the State Council at the meeting. He said: First, regarding the personnel arrangements of the State Council, only one of the eight offices of the State Council has a non-Party Deputy Director. Whether this is a good practice can be considered. It is not necessary to have non-Party members in every department, but it is beneficial to have people who are familiar with the business. Second, the eight offices of the State Council, as assistants to the Premier and Vice Premiers, have done some specific and comprehensive work and solved some difficult problems between departments, so they are very necessary and should be strengthened. The problem with the State Council's offices is that their opinions are often not unified, so dealing with problems becomes "research again and again, negotiate again and again, and delay again and again." The offices are somewhat accommodating to the ministries, and they dare not speak out or insist when they see problems. The offices should adhere to the Party's policies, the instructions of the Premier and Vice Premiers, and the decisions of the State Council. Third, the State Council is the highest administrative organ of the state, and it should be more cautious in studying policies and guidelines. Some decisions should not be announced in a hurry. Fourth, the State Council must regularly check the work of the central organs and expose shortcomings to promote improvement. The contradictions between the central departments are serious, with departmentalism and one-sidedness. The State Council's inspection can help resolve these contradictions. Fifth, the practice of streamlining institutions and tightening staffing is unrealistic because the streamlined personnel cannot be decentralized or sent out. In recent years, the number of people transferred upward has actually exceeded the number of people decentralized. Secondly, the establishment of various organs varies, and the foundations are different, so the percentage of streamlining cannot be mechanically prescribed. The State Council should comprehensively consider the size of each organ during the Second Five-Year Plan. Sixth, in personnel work, the Personnel Bureau of the State Council has the phenomenon of "one faction, two outs, three pushes, and four don't cares." Some cadres are not suitable for working in the central organs and also request to be decentralized. Attention should be paid to using people according to their abilities during streamlining and a good cleaning should be done. Seventh, at present, young students are being called upon to participate in labor production, but middle schools and universities lack labor practice education. There are problems with the educational environment, practice, and methods. It is not enough to simply advocate labor without labor practice education. Eighth, the State Council should check and summarize the issues of non-Party members having positions and powers, having positions and partial powers, and having positions without power, and should not rely entirely on the United Front Department and the Party groups of various organs. Ninth, the State Council should fix the holding of forums with non-Party members as a system and can also hold such forums in organs below the State Council, not just as a method in the rectification campaign. Tenth, the State Council should rectify and reform at the same time during the rectification campaign, but should be cautious about changes in major matters and should not be hasty. Making mistakes is bureaucracy plus bureaucracy.

    Wu Qingyou, who works at the People's Bank of China, said in his speech that we should learn from or refer to foreign advanced experience based on China's actual situation. He suggested that the Bureau of Foreign Experts summarize the experiences of relevant units in learning from foreign advanced experience and giving play to the role of foreign experts.

    Tan Shengyang, who works at the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, believes that the State Council has not provided enough support to the newly established State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in terms of allocating technical forces, material equipment, and allocating housing, and that units such as the Ministry of Geology have departmentalism, which has caused many difficulties for the work of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.

    Chen Jun suggests purchasing some raw cotton from the international market and making cotton textiles in China for export.

    Chen Jun, a Counselor of the State Council, suggested at the meeting that some raw cotton should be purchased from the international market and made into cotton textiles in China for export.

    He believes that this way of doing business can avoid the waste of some textile machines being shut down due to insufficient domestic cotton supply, solve the livelihood problems of textile workers, and increase the country's income.

    Chen Jun also talked about how to use the means of production and labor force in the hands of the state to expand reproduction and the issue of political economy research. He criticized the People's Publishing House, saying that he wrote a book of tens of thousands of words on political economy, but because he put forward his own new views on major theoretical issues, the People's Publishing House did not dare to publish it.

    Bao Huiseng believes that various ministries do not consider major issues, which can be pushed to the State Council, while minor issues are kicked to the provinces and cities. The State Council and various ministries should have an appropriate division of labor.

    Bao Huiseng, a Counselor of the State Council, raised four issues. First, regarding the relationship between Party members and non-Party members: Bao Huiseng believes that the "wall" is caused by some non-Party cadres "praising and flattering" Party members with low levels to the point where they are out of reach and can no longer listen to others' opinions. The Communist Party is selfless in its work, proceeds from reality, and uses people according to their talents, regardless of whether they are Party members or non-Party members, so that everyone can give full play to their talents. Naturally, there will be no "walls" or "ditches." Second, regarding the powers and responsibilities of the State Council and the ministries, he believes that the various ministries do not consider major issues now, which can be pushed to the State Council, while minor issues are kicked to the provinces and cities. He said that the State Council and the various ministries should have an appropriate division of labor, delegating the powers of the State Council to the ministries and assigning specific tasks to the ministries. The State Council is responsible for policies and guidelines and for supervising and inspecting the work. Third, regarding institutions and personnel, he believes that there should be appropriate arrangements and that they can also be streamlined and adjusted. For example, the Immigration Bureau of the Ministry of Civil Affairs has no work this year and can be abolished. Urban relief and rural relief do not need to be set up as two separate divisions and can be merged, with sections set up under the divisions separately. Fourth, regarding the urban population problem, he believes that there are two phenomena of overpopulation: serious unemployment and insufficient food. China does not have these two phenomena now, so it cannot be said to be overpopulated. He also suggested continuing to conduct population surveys.

    国务院党外人士继续座谈
    对国家机关各方面工作提出许多意见
    据新华社4日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋在3日和4日下午继续邀请党外人士举行座谈会。
    余遂辛认为国家机关层次多是官僚主义的根源
    国务院参事余遂辛谈到民主集中制的问题，他认为，国家机关的层次太多，国务院指示传达到基层比十八层宝塔还要多，这是官僚主义的一个强有力的根源，各部门还存在本位主义，互相推诿，由于机关太多和太庞大，对下面管得太严，上面一天忙于布置、传达、开会、印文件，下面急待解决的事不能很快得到解决。工厂企业非生产人员也太多，有一个六百人的工厂，管理人员就有近一百七十人，因此增加了生产成本，产生了官僚主义。余遂辛建议中央把一部分权力下放到地方，使很多问题能够很快在当地得到解决；随着权力的下放，很多上层机构的人也可以下放。
    林志钧认为法典工作进行得太慢；要取消以公函代替法律的作法。
    国务院参事林志钧的发言着重谈了法律问题。他认为要人民依法守法，总得有法。现在我们的法典工作进行得太慢，很多方面用公函代替法律，这一定要取消。他认为订暂行条例比用公函好，而且与宪法并无抵触。他又批评对律师制度重视注意不够；还建议对街道工作干部给予重视、鼓励和生活上的补助。
    罗子为对国务院工作提出十点意见
    在中央手工业管理局工作的罗子为在会上对国务院工作提出了十点意见。他说，一、关于国务院的人事安排，国务院八个办公室只有一个非党的副主任，这样的作法好不好可以考虑，不必每个部门都要有党外人士，但有熟悉业务的人是有好处的。二、国务院的八个办公室作为总理和副总理的助手，作了一些具体和综合的工作，解决了一些部门的困难问题和部门与部门之间的问题，因此是非常必要的，而且还要加强。国务院各办公室存在的问题是，各办公室之间意见往往不统一，因此处理问题就“研究再研究、协商再协商、拖延再拖延”。各办公室对各部有些迁就，看出问题不敢讲，不敢坚持。各办公室应当坚持党的政策，坚持总理、副总理的指示和国务院的决定。三、国务院是国家最高管理机关，研究方针政策要更审慎一些，有些决定不要急于公布。四、国务院必须定期检查中央各机关的工作，揭发缺点，来推动改进工作。中央各部门之间的矛盾是严重的，存在着本位主义和片面性，国务院进行检查，可以帮助解决这些矛盾。五、精简机构、紧缩编制的作法是不现实的，因为精简的人员下放不了、派不出去，几年来实际上是上调的超过下放的，其次各机关成立有早晚，基础不同，不能机械地规定精简的百分比，国务院应当通盘考虑各机关在第二个五年计划期间的规模。六、人事工作，国务院人事局有“一派、二出、三推、四不管”的现象，有些干部不适合在中央机关工作，自己也要求下放，在精简时要注意因人使用，很好地清理一下。七、目前号召青年学生参加劳动生产，但中学、大学缺乏劳动实践的教育，教育环境、实践、方法上都有问题，只提倡劳动而没有劳动实践的教育是不解决问题的。八、国务院要检查总结非党人士有职有权、有职有部分权、有职无权的问题，不要完全靠统战部门和各机关的党组。九、国务院应当把召开党外人士座谈会作为制度固定下来，并且可以到国务院以下的机关中去召开这样的座谈会，不要只是作为整风中的方法。十、国务院在整风中应当边整边改，但对重大事情的改变要慎重，不能草率，改错了是官僚主义加官僚主义。
    在中国人民银行工作的吴清友在发言中谈到应该从中国实际情况出发学习或参考外国先进经验的问题。他建议外国专家局总结各有关单位学习外国先进经验、发挥外国专家的作用的经验。
    在国家测绘总局工作的谭声洋认为，国务院对国家测绘总局这一新成立的机构在调配技术力量、物资装备、分配房屋等问题上支持不够，而地质部等单位又有本位主义，使国家测绘总局的工作遭遇到很多困难。
    陈钧建议从国际市场上购买一些原棉，在国内制成棉纺织品再出口
    国务院参事陈钧在会上建议，从国际市场上购买一些原棉，在国内制成棉纺织品再出口。
    他认为，用这样的做生意的办法，可以避免因国内棉花供应不足而使一部分纺织机器停工待料的浪费，可以解决纺织工人的生活问题，还能使国家增加一些收入。
    陈钧在发言中还谈到如何运用国家掌握的生产资料和劳动力进行扩大再生产的问题，以及政治经济学研究的问题。他批评人民出版社说，他写了一部几万字的关于政治经济学的著作，因为对重大的理论问题提出了自己的新见解，人民出版社就不敢出版。
    包惠僧认为各部对大的问题不考虑，可以推到国务院，小问题踢到省市，国务院和各部应适当分工
    国务院参事包惠僧提出了四个问题。一、关于党与非党关系：包惠僧认为“墙”是由于一部分非党干部的“歌颂捧拍”把水平不高的党员捧到九霄云外不能再听别人的意见造成的，共产党在工作上大公无私，从实际出发，不论党与非党，量才使用，使人尽其才，自然就没有“墙”和“沟”了。二、关于院、部权力和责任问题，他认为现在各部对大的问题不考虑，可以推到国务院，小问题踢到省市。他说，国务院和各部应当适当分工，把院的权限下放到部，把具体业务交给部去作，国务院负责政策方针，作督促检查的工作。三、关于机构人员，他认为应有适当的安排，还可以精简、调整，例如内务部的移民局今年没有工作，就可以不设，城市救济和农村救济不必分别设立两个司，可以合并后在司下面分别设科。四、关于城市人口问题，他认为人口过剩有两个现象，失业严重和粮食不够，我国现在没有这两个现象，所以不能说是人口过剩，他还建议继续进行人口调查。
