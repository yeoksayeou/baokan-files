    Jinan City Begins Comprehensive Price Inspection
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jinan Municipal Committee, and the Jinan Municipal People's Committee, in mid-to-late May, selected a group of cadres to organize a price inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of prices throughout the city. This inspection officially began on May 21. The scope and content of this inspection include the current prices of all aspects of industry, commerce, and handicrafts. The focus of the inspection is on the unreasonable pricing of various commodities after the price freeze on July 23, 1956. Through this inspection, those improperly adjusted and unreasonably increased commodity prices will be returned to their original price levels, and newly set unreasonable prices will also be reasonably adjusted. ·Wang Xiyi·

    济南市开始全面检查物价
    中共山东省委、济南市委和济南市人民委员会，在5月中下旬抽调一批干部组织了物价检查小组，对全市物价进行全面检查。这个检查于5月21日已正式开始。这次检查的范围和内容，包括工业、商业、手工业的各个方面的现行价格。重点检查从1956年7月23日冻结物价以后，各种商品订价的不合理现象。通过这次检查，对那些调价不当和不合理的上涨了的商品价格，将全部调回原有价格水平，对于新订的不合理的价格，亦将合理调整。　·王希漪·
