The Leadership Relationship Between the Communist Party and the Democratic Parties Should Be Changed
Excerpts from the Speech of Ai Weisheng, Member of the China Democratic League and Associate Professor of Central China Normal College

　　Is the formulation of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" appropriate enough? Because "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is a reciprocal, equal term; unequal parties should not be treated equally. Currently, the Communist Party and the democratic parties are in a relationship of leadership and being led, one leading and one being led, with different statuses. The Communist Party is a large party, and the democratic parties are all small. How can the small supervise the large? This is a contradiction. Under these circumstances, it is inexplicable to talk about long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

　　Looking at past facts, the democratic parties can only offer opinions on the finished products proposed by the Communist Party. For example, if the Communist Party puts forward a document, the democratic parties will change a few words in it, such as changing "之" (zhi) to "的" (de), or "we" to "everyone." The democratic parties can only construct, not design. The democratic parties do not participate in formulating plans. The Party is in a position to help and guide the democratic parties, and the democratic parties are being helped and guided. Therefore, the label of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision cannot be applied. Therefore, the leadership relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties should be changed.

　　In practice, an intellectuals' party should be established, merging several of the democratic parties, such as the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Workers' and Farmers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society, to form a political party for intellectuals. This party would be a party of revolutionary intellectuals. Currently, the number of democratic party members varies in different units, some with three or five, and some with hundreds. If they are organized, they will play a greater role.

### 共产党与民主党派之间的领导与被领导关系应该改变  民盟盟员、华中师范学院副教授艾玮生的言论摘要

　　共产党与民主党派之间的领导与被领导关系应该改变
    民盟盟员、华中师范学院副教授艾玮生的言论摘要
    “长期共存、互相监督”的提法是不是不够恰当？因为“长期共存、互相监督”是对等的、双方的平等称呼，不能以不平等的双方来平等对待。当前共产党和民主党派是领导和被领导的关系，一个领导，一个被领导，地位有所不同；共产党是大党，民主党派都不大，小的怎么样来监督大的呢？这是个矛盾。在这种情况下，如果说长期共存、互相监督是解释不通的。
    以过去的事实来看，民主党派只能在共产党提出的成品上提意见，比如共产党提出一个文件，民主党派便在这个文件上改几个字，像“之”字改成“的”字，“我们”改成“大家”等。民主党派只能施工，不能设计，拟定计划民主党派是不参加的，党对民主党派是帮助指导的地位，民主党派是被帮助指导的，所以长期共存、互相监督的这个帽子是扣不上的。所以，共产党和民主党派之间领导与被领导的关系，应该改变。
    在做法上应成立知识分子党，将民盟、民进、农工、九三等几个民主党派合并，成立知识分子的政党。这个政党是革命的知识分子的党。目前有些单位民主党派成员多少不等，有的三、五个，有的上百个，如果组织起来，他们会发挥更大的作用。
