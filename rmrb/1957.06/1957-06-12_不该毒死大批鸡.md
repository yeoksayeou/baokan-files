　　Should Not Have Poisoned a Large Number of Chickens
    The phenomenon of banning chickens is very serious in many counties of Jiangsu Province. Taking Juining County as an example, as early as April 25th, some cadres of agricultural cooperatives in Tiaoyuan Township, Liji District, and Wuji Township, Qiuji District, adopted the method of poisoning chickens to prevent chicken raising. According to incomplete statistics from 412 agricultural cooperatives in 97 townships throughout the county, nearly 100,000 chickens have been poisoned to death. All the live chickens in the third team of Xincun Township, Gaozuo District, were poisoned to death. Recently, 305 of the 512 chickens in Huangzhuang Brigade, Xingren Township, have been poisoned to death. Dai Xinhua's family of four in the township raised a few hens to lay eggs to supplement their livelihood. After all the chickens were poisoned to death on May 7th, the whole family tried to fight the brigade cadres. Yu Zheng'an cried and cursed for a whole day after his three chickens were poisoned to death. At present, this phenomenon is still expanding. Why do they want to ban chickens? The leaders and brigade cadres in these counties and the agricultural cooperatives believe that raising chickens damages crops, so raising chickens is not allowed.
    At the end of March this year, the Siyang County Party Committee arranged at a meeting of district Party committee secretaries that each household should not raise more than five chickens. However, when it came to the agricultural cooperatives below, they were only allowed to raise one or two chickens. Otherwise, their food rations would be deducted. The county party secretary also arranged at the meeting of district Party committee secretaries: no feed should be supplied to chicks, and no loans should be given to kang workshops for hatching chicks, etc., to restrict the development of poultry. Therefore, all kang workshops in the county have been closed.
    We believe that this practice of banning chickens is very wrong and should be corrected quickly. Regarding the poisoning to death of nearly 100,000 chickens in Juining County, we suggest that the relevant departments deal with it.  Liu Guangzhi

### 不该毒死大批鸡

　　不该毒死大批鸡
    江苏省不少县禁鸡的现象非常严重。拿雎宁县来讲，在4月25日即有李集区挑元乡和丘集区吴集乡不少农业社的干部，采取用药毒死鸡子的办法来阻止养鸡。根据全县九十七个乡四百十二个农业社不完全统计，已被用药毒死的鸡子近十万只。高作区新村乡第三小队所有活鸡全被毒死。兴仁乡黄庄大队五百十二只鸡子最近已被毒死三百零五只。该乡戴新华家四口人养有几只母鸡生蛋辅助生活，在5月7日被全部毒死后，全家找社干拚命；余正安三只鸡被毒死后整整哭骂了一天。目前，这种现象仍在继续扩大。他们为什么要禁鸡呢？这些县的领导上以及社干们和农业社认为：养鸡要损害庄稼，所以不准养鸡。
    在今年3月底，泗阳县委就曾在区委书记会议上布置每户养鸡不准超过五只。可是，一到了下面各农业社时，就只准养一、二只鸡了。否则，就要扣口粮。县委书记还在区委书记会议上布置：不准供给小鸡饲料，不准给孵小鸡的炕坊贷款等等，来限制家禽的发展。因此，全县炕房已全部停业。
    我们认为，这种禁鸡的做法是非常错误的，应该迅速纠正。对雎宁县全县毒死近十万只鸡子一事，建议有关部门加以处理。  刘广志
