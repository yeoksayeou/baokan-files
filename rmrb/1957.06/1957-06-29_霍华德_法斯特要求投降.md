　　Howard Fast Demands Surrender
　　Foster
　　Editor's Note: Howard Fast is a famous American writer. He has written works opposing racial discrimination in the United States and defending democratic rights, and participated in the international movement for peace and socialism. However, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Hungarian incident, he abandoned the position of the working class, announced his withdrawal from the American Communist Party, and attacked socialist countries and communist parties. William Z. Foster, honorary chairman of the American Communist Party, wrote an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on June 17, analyzing Fast's betrayal. Below is an excerpt of Foster's article:
　　The novel, complex, and unsettling problem of the Stalin cult of personality and its consequences in Hungary have frustrated Fast. This problem stripped away his thin Marxist veneer and exposed the bourgeois nationalism not far beneath. He is now continuing to propagate his confused ideas and disappointments to the workers in bourgeois newspapers (June 9 "New York Times"). He shouts, "How sad! It's all over!" He calls on workers to abandon the Soviet Union and abandon the Communist Party. Obviously, such a line would lead to confusion among the workers and to the destruction of organized socialism, if the fighting workers were naive enough to follow such a line. But the workers will not do so.
　　Fast's path and the path of revolutionary workers are in opposite directions. The workers, unlike Fast, do not admit defeat. As a great whole, they are resolutely dealing with the problem of the Stalin cult and all aspects involved, and are determined to master it, just as they have done on many other occasions in the long and fierce struggle for socialism. If they had shown the kind of confusion and cowardice in history that Fast is now showing, the labor movement would have been destroyed long ago under the relentless attacks of capitalism.
　　The statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is basically correct, stating that Stalin's erroneous policies, no matter how harmful, did not change the foundation of the socialist system in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and revolutionary workers in other countries are dealing with this issue on the basis of this reality, and are methodically making up for the serious damage caused by Stalin in his later years. They are not misled by the "it's all over!" view of Fast and his ilk, which would only lead the socialist world to disaster.
　　Due to his emotionalism (rather than Marxist analysis), Fast does not know what happened in the Soviet Union under the Stalin cult of personality, nor does he understand why this development occurred.
　　However, to understand and solve the various problems of the people in the extremely difficult and complex struggle for socialism, more than just emotion and spiritual anger are needed.
　　The main economic and political background of the Stalin cult was the extreme need for the Soviet people to maintain a high degree of unity, discipline, and mobilization since the establishment of the regime in November 1917, in order to protect themselves from the aggressive threats of capitalist encirclement and destruction. This strict discipline—largely accepted by the people as a revolutionary necessity—was to deal with long-standing and powerful domestic enemies, to rapidly industrialize the country and build a large number of new engineers and skilled workers, to deal with the unprecedented military attacks of Hitler's fascist bandits, and to deal with the looming threat of atomic war provoked by the US imperialism's movement to conquer the world.
　　It was under these extremely urgent circumstances—which long required military and semi-military discipline—that the Stalin cult, under the guise of necessity and with the help of the Party's relaxation of vigilance, managed to maintain itself and caused fatal damage. Indeed, all this is extremely bad, but to describe it as a degeneration of socialism, as Fast does, thus making it necessary to deny the Soviet regime and the Communist Parties around the world, is a gross distortion and a blow to the world socialist movement.
　　The fighting workers in various countries, under their respective specific conditions, opposed the evils of the Stalin cult and took action in a constructive way to correct these evils. In various capitalist countries, the Communist Parties are also correcting their own unique shortcomings during the Stalin cult period in the same progressive spirit.
　　Therefore, these parties are using the lessons of the Stalin cult; but they are not using this new development to undermine their movement, as Fast hopes they will.
　　Revolutionary workers certainly hold him fully responsible for the rash actions he is now taking.

　　霍华德·法斯特要求投降
　　福斯特
    编者按　霍华德·法斯特是美国有名的作家。他曾经写过一些反对美国国内种族歧视和维护民主权利的作品，参加过国际争取和平和社会主义的运动。但是在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和匈牙利事件之后，他抛弃了工人阶级的立场，宣布退出美国共产党，并对社会主义国家和共产党进行攻击。美国共产党名誉主席福斯特在6月17日纽约“工人日报”上著文，对法斯特的叛变进行了分析。下面是福斯特的文章的摘要：
    斯大林个人崇拜这个新奇的、复杂的和令人不安的问题以及它在匈牙利产生的后果，使法斯特感到沮丧。这个问题揭去了他的薄薄的马克思主义外衣，并且暴露出藏在外衣下面不远的资产阶级民族主义。他现在继续在资产阶级报纸（6月9日的“纽约时报”）上向工人宣扬他的混乱思想和失望情绪。他大声叫道：“真伤心呵！一切都完了！”他号召工人背弃苏联，抛弃共产党。显然，这样一种路线将是导向工人的混乱，导向有组织的社会主义的毁灭的道路，如果战斗的工人竟然天真得遵循这种路线的话。但是，工人们是不会这样做的。
    法斯特的道路和革命工人的道路的方向是相反的。工人们不像法斯特那样认输，他们作为一个伟大的整体正在坚决地处理斯大林崇拜问题以及这个问题所牵涉的一切方面，并且决心掌握它，正如他们在争取社会主义的漫长而激烈的斗争中在很多其他场合下所作的那样。如果他们在历史上表现了法斯特现在所表现的那种混乱和懦弱，劳工运动老早就在资本主义的无情攻击下被摧毁了。
    苏联共产党中央委员会的声明基本上是正确的，声明的大意是说，斯大林的错误政策，不论多么有害，并没有改变苏联国内的社会主义制度的基础。苏联同其他国家的革命工人就在这种现实的基础上处理这个问题，并且正在有条不紊地弥补斯大林晚年所造成的严重的损害。他们并没有受法斯特之流的“一切都完了！”的看法的迷惑，这种看法只会把社会主义世界导向灾难。
    法斯特由于他的感情主义（而不是马克思主义的分析），不知道在斯大林个人崇拜下在苏联发生了什么情况，他也不了解为什么有了这种发展。
    然而，为了了解和解决人民在为争取社会主义而进行的极其困难和复杂的斗争中的种种问题，所需要的不仅是感情和精神上的愤怒。
    斯大林崇拜的主要的经济和政治背景是：自1917年11月这个政权建立以来，苏联人民极其需要保持高度的团结、纪律性和动员状态，以便使他们自己免受资本主义的包围和破坏的咄咄逼人的威胁。这种严格的纪律——大体上已作为革命的必要条件而为人民所接受——是为了对付长期以来很强大的国内敌人的，是为了国家的迅速工业化和建立大批的新工程师和熟练工人的，是为了对付希特勒法西斯匪徒的空前的军事攻击和对付由于美帝国主义的征服世界的运动而挑起的有爆发之势的原子大战的。
    就是在这些极端迫切的情况——它们长期需要军事和半军事的纪律——之下，斯大林崇拜就在必要性的借口下并且在党放松警惕这一事实的帮助下，设法保持下来，并且造成了致命的损害。的确，所有这些是极其不好的，但是如果像法斯特那样把它说成是社会主义的退化，因而使得有必要否认苏联政权和全世界的各个共产党，那是极大的歪曲，是对世界社会主义运动的一个打击。
    各国的战斗的工人们在他们各自不同的具体条件下，反对了斯大林崇拜的弊端，并且以一种建设性的方式采取行动来纠正这些弊端。在各个资本主义国家中，共产党也是本着同样的进步精神纠正自己在斯大林崇拜时期中特有的缺点。
    因此，这些党正在利用斯大林崇拜的教训；但是它们并不是像法斯特希望它们作的那样用这个新发展来破坏它们的运动。
    革命的工人们肯定认为他要为他现在采取的轻率行动负完全责任。
