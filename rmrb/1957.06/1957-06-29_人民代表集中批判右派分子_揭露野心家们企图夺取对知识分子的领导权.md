Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued its discussion today on Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. The vast majority of representative groups focused on criticizing bourgeois rightist elements.

	Why did Luo Longji say that the Communist Party cannot lead the great intellectuals?
	Intellectuals should be wary of the ambition of the rightists and strengthen ideological remolding

	In the Sichuan delegation group, Shao Quanlin, vice chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, said that the rightists wanted to use the contradiction between the proletarian and bourgeois ideologies that still existed in the consciousness of intellectuals to create a Hungarian incident in our country. However, the rightists miscalculated. But, he said, close attention should be paid to these right-wing ambitious people, who are infiltrating science, literature, education, news, industry and commerce, and other fields. They are trying to gain leadership among five million intellectuals. For example, Luo Longji once said that the Communist Party can only lead workers, peasants, and small intellectuals, but not great intellectuals. Shao Quanlin believes that intellectuals should be more vigilant and conscientiously strengthen ideological remolding.
	Under the urging of the Sichuan representatives, Zhang Naiqi participated in the group meeting for the first time this afternoon. In his speech, he emphasized that he "cannot subjectively find any anti-Party and anti-socialist" thoughts, and he repeated his hackneyed tune of "loving the Party as much as loving his own eyeballs." During the discussion, Xu Chonglin revealed that Zhang Naiqi's political character has always been bad, and it is no accident that he insists on taking the capitalist road today. Hou Wailu pointed out that Zhang Naiqi was "reviewing" while pretending to be a leader and a Marxist. He asked Zhang Naiqi to conduct a good review from the roots of the bourgeoisie.
	Several labor models in the Jiangxi Province delegation group questioned Luo Longji on the spot about who he was speaking for. As a representative elected by the people of Jiangxi, why did Luo Longji forget the entrustment of the people of Jiangxi? Guo Qingsi, a worker from Pingxiang Coal Mine and industrial labor model, said that the workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the workers will not agree with anyone who opposes socialism. Li Youxiu, an agricultural labor model, said that if the rightists oppose socialism, they will fight the rightists desperately. Wei Xiuying, a female representative from the old revolutionary base in southern Jiangxi who participated in the Long March, said that the people of the old revolutionary base will not allow the rightists to be so crazy, and they must fight the rightists to the end. Wei Xiuying questioned Luo Longji and said, your hometown is in the old revolutionary base, how can you not understand the power of the people of Jiangxi?

	Long Yun's fallacy denying ethnic minorities is very similar to Chiang Kai-shek's remarks
	The Yunnan delegation group has been refuting Long Yun's erroneous remarks for days. In his speech at the group meeting on the 24th, Long Yun denied that Yunnan is a multi-ethnic province. He said that China's ethnic minorities have not been as complicated as they are now since ancient times, and everyone has the same ancestor. Long Yun also believed that since ethnic minorities have autonomy, they should rely on their own efforts and not rely on others. Long Yun also said that before Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published, there was no clear standard for judging right and wrong, so it is not easy to say who is a rightist and who is a leftist now. Long Yun's fallacy of denying ethnic minorities aroused the indignation of the representatives of various ethnic minorities in Yunnan. Dao Youliang, deputy governor of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, said that the ethnic minorities in Xishuangbanna settled and developed very early. In 1926, when Long Yun was the chairman of Yunnan Province, he ordered the revocation of the Xishuangbanna Administrative Region, changed it to a special zone, and sent a puppet county magistrate to search for wealth from the people. After liberation, the Communist Party of China restored the name Xishuangbanna. Dao Youliang said that the Communist Party of China is the savior of our ethnic minorities, and the motherland is our mother. It is absolutely impossible for anyone who wants to separate us from the Communist Party and the Han people. Zhao Zhongqi, a member of the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, also opposed Long Yun's view of denying ethnic minorities, and refuted it by citing historical facts. He said that according to Long Yun's statement, the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy seems to be able to be cancelled. Ma Jian, a professor at Peking University, pointed out that Long Yun's absurd view of ethnic minorities is very similar to Chiang Kai-shek's statement in the book "China's Destiny" that China's ethnic minorities are large and small branches of the Han nationality. Mei Yi, director of the Broadcasting Bureau, said that Long Yun complained that Chairman Mao's report was published late, which was essentially a pretext to cover up his mistakes. He said that the basic principles of people's political life can be found in the Constitution, and Long Yun raised his hand when the Constitution was passed.
	The Henan Province delegation group criticized Zhang Yunchuan's anti-socialist words and deeds. According to the representatives' revelations, Zhang Yunchuan has always obliterated achievements and exaggerated shortcomings. After he inspected work in the Henan area, he openly said that "80% of the peasants in Henan oppose the Communist Party"; just after the autumn harvest, every family had food, but he said that "the people look emaciated." At the group meeting, Zhang Yunchuan refused to expose his thoughts and actions and tried his best to defend his mistakes.

	What is the relationship between Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and Lin Xiling?
	The Hunan Province representatives asked them to clarify this issue

	In the Hunan Province delegation group, Jian Bozan said that when the rightists attacked socialism, a female student named Lin Xiling from the Renmin University of China went to Peking University to give an anti-socialist speech, which caused a great uproar in the school. Lin Xiling was living in Tan Tiwu's home at the time. Jian Bozan asked Tan Tiwu to clarify this matter. Representative Li Zheren also revealed that when Lin Xiling was living in Tan Tiwu's home, Huang Shaohong went there and talked to her for four hours, and Lin Xiling returned to the school and continued to incite students to oppose socialism.
	In the military delegation group, ten combat heroes spoke today. They believe that in the future, they must still hold their guns tightly and vigilantly defend the construction of the motherland and the interests of the people. Combat heroes Huang Chouhe, Wang Yougen, Song Zhongfu, and Jiang Xueshan all talked about how they fought north and south in the past, sacrificing blood, just to strive for the construction of socialism. In the battle, many comrades sacrificed, and they advanced on the blood of the martyrs and achieved victory. The representatives said that now the rightists want to destroy the fruits of victory, which is absolutely not allowed.
	Some representative groups continued to criticize rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun, Huang Shaohong, and Chu Anping. Zhang Bojun still did not attend the group meeting today.

	The achievements of the Party's ethnic policy are enormous
	Representatives of ethnic minorities counterattack the rightists' divisive activities

	Representatives of ethnic minorities spoke at the Gansu, Tibet, Qamdo, Hunan, and Guangxi groups today. These representatives unanimously expressed their warm support for Premier Zhou's report; many representatives believed that the achievements of the Party's ethnic policy were enormous.
	Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), vice governor of Gansu Province and governor of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, concluded from the living conditions of the Gannan Tibetan people before and after liberation, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no ethnic unity." He said that before liberation, the Gan family in Gannan and the Jiawu, two neighboring Tibetan tribes in Qinghai, fought every summer to compete for grassland. The Kuomintang officials at that time said they came to mediate, but actually used the opportunity to extort money. As a result, the battle continued, and it lasted for thirty-five years. Many people died for this, and more than 10,000 livestock were lost. It was not until 1951, with the help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, that the people of the two tribes resolved their grievances and united. He said that this would have been difficult to do without the leadership of the Communist Party.
	At the Tibet and Qamdo delegation group meetings, Pingcuo Wangjie said that the People's Government has destroyed the feudal economy that has existed for thousands of years and established a collectively owned economic system in just a few years, which is a huge achievement. The smooth passage of last year's major famine is a clear proof of the superiority of the socialist system.
	Wu Tongxing, the head of Tongdao Dong Autonomous County in Hunan Province, introduced the economic situation of the peasants in three agricultural production cooperatives in Ganxi Township in this county at the group meeting. According to this introduction, the agricultural and sideline economy of Ganxi Township has developed greatly since its liberation at the end of 1950. Among them, the rice production of the three cooperatives in 1956 increased by 29%-35% compared with before liberation, animal husbandry increased by 24%-26% respectively, and poultry increased by 39%-61% respectively. With the development of production, the average annual income of the members of the three cooperatives in 1956 increased by 22%-30% compared with before liberation, while the economic burden of the peasants was greatly reduced. For example, compared with 1950, the economic burden of poor peasants has been reduced by 224%, the economic burden of old lower-middle peasants has been reduced by 157.8%, and the economic burden of rich peasants has been reduced by 42.8%. Wu Tongxing said that these circumstances prove that Premier Zhou's report is realistic, and the rightists' fabrication of so-called "people's lives have not improved," "peasants' burdens are too heavy," and other lies are aimed at alienating the relationship between the Party and the people, but their attempts will never be achieved.
	Yang Wengui, the head of the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province, said that the people's lives in Damiaoshan were extremely poor before liberation, and many people starved to death every year, and after liberation, because the People's Government helped the people in the mountainous areas develop production with financial and material resources, the people have been freed from the threat of hunger. At the same time, this remote mountainous area that had no culture in the past has not only produced many junior high school graduates, but also high school students, which is unprecedented in the history of Damiaoshan. After talking about these situations, he asked Huang Shaohong: After liberation, are the shortcomings the main ones or the achievements the main ones?

	Many representatives talked about their inspection experiences:
	Such a great cause can only be realized under the socialist system

	At the Sichuan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hebei, and other representative group meetings, many representatives also refuted various fallacies of the bourgeois rightists who attempted to obliterate the achievements of the work of the Party and the government based on what they saw during their inspections and the work of their own departments. The writer Ai Wu, who had inspected Shaoxing, the hometown of Mr. Lu Xun, said that due to winemaking and other reasons, Shaoxing has always been a place lacking food, and on average, there are always three or four months of grain every year that needs to be supported by other places. However, now Shaoxing has become a surplus grain county, with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu last year and another increase to more than 700 jin this year. Li Fudu, deputy director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, talked about China's great plan to harness the Yellow River. He pointed out with his own experience that such a great cause can only be realized under the socialist system, and there is no way to realize it in the old China. Rong Guanxiu, a representative of Hebei Province and the mother of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, said that the Communist Party led the peasants to implement land reform, and she was given five tiled houses and more than ten mu of land, with food and clothing. Last year, there was a disaster, and the peasants had no food to eat, but with the cooperative and the government's relief, there was rice, clothes, and everything. She asked: If there is no Communist Party, how can there be such a good life?
	Luo Qiong and Cao Guanqun, secretaries of the All-China Women's Federation Secretariat, and Li Fenglian, director of the Women Workers' Department and Children's Division of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, introduced the participation of women in construction at the Jiangsu and Shaanxi delegation groups respectively to refute the rightists. They said that the number of female employees in national agencies and enterprises has reached three million, which is equivalent to seven times the number at the beginning of the founding of the country. There are 400 women in the country who have become tractor drivers. In 1956, 22% of the people's representatives at the district and township levels were women, and many women served as high-level national leaders and county heads and township heads. In rural areas, due to the agricultural collectivization, women's labor force has been liberated, and more than 110 million women across the country have now joined agricultural cooperatives. More than 70% of the cooperatives in the country have female chairpersons, and 60% of the townships have female heads. They pointed out that this huge change in the social status of women is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party.

	The practice of building the country through diligence and thrift must form a social atmosphere. Attention should be paid to educating the younger generation well

	During the discussion, the representatives also continued to make criticisms and suggestions on the work of the government. During the discussion in the Anhui, Shanxi, Qinghai, Shanghai, and other representative group meetings, some representatives suggested that the government should further educate the people to be vigilant against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. Zhang Huiting, a representative of Anhui Province and director of an agricultural production cooperative, used the fact that he was poisoned by counter-revolutionaries this year and that counter-revolutionaries burned 7,000 jin of cooperative grain to illustrate the necessity of strengthening vigilance education. Zaxi Wangxu, vice governor of Qinghai Province, pointed out in his speech that the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have been closely united in recent years, but counter-revolutionaries are still undermining this unity. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly educate the people to be more vigilant and not be fooled by counter-revolutionaries.
	At the Hubei Province delegation group meeting, many representatives also emphasized the importance of building the country through diligence and thrift. Peng Yangqin, an industrial labor model in Wuhan, said that after listening to the Premier's report, he felt even more that it is not easy to manage such a country. Since liberation, the annual profit of Wuhan's power industry can only meet 30% of the expansion needs of the enterprise; the 2,800 employees of the power industry spend more than 3 million yuan a year on living and welfare expenses excluding wages, which accounts for more than 10% of the wealth created. The Premier said that the average per capita increase in consumer goods produced each year in the country is only worth four yuan, and productivity is only that high, and capital accumulation is not easy. To solve this problem, we cannot rely on empty slogans, let alone rightists standing on the top of the mountain and making sarcastic remarks, but we must work hard to build the country through diligence and thrift. Wu Yunduo, the author of the book "Dedicate Everything to the Party," said that the practice of building the country through diligence and thrift must form a social atmosphere, and education should be strengthened in all aspects. He said that many young workers now do not know the hardship of revolution and construction, and only know how to talk about ostentation and show off their wealth. He said that he had been to a factory with newly built factory buildings and saw two young workers who had finished eating watermelon competing to see who could break the glass window with watermelon rinds. Some female workers bought more than a dozen pairs of leather shoes, and each pair was put to use. This kind of atmosphere is very bad. The writer Cao Yu said that we should educate the younger generation well. The lives of today's young people are really heaven and earth compared with before liberation, but they have not suffered hardships and do not understand where today's bright days come from. He said that some young people even directly asked him: How can I become famous? Can this kind of young people be regarded as "young masters after the revolution"! With this kind of thinking, they will feel dissatisfied if they are not satisfied, and rightist remarks will have a market. Zhu Zaodi, an industrial labor model in Wuhan, said that it is best to let such young people know more about the painful life of the old society. Tu Changwang, director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, said that the current extravagance and waste phenomena in various aspects also have a very bad impact on young people, and this kind of extravagance and waste phenomena should be severely criticized and corrected.

### 人民代表集中批判右派分子  揭露野心家们企图夺取对知识分子的领导权

　　人民代表集中批判右派分子
    揭露野心家们企图夺取对知识分子的领导权
    据新华社28日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天继续讨论周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。绝大多数代表小组集中地批判了资产阶级右派分子。
    罗隆基为什么说共产党不能领导大知识分子
    知识分子应该警惕右派的野心加强思想改造
    在四川代表小组上，中国作家协会副主席邵荃麟说，右派分子想利用知识分子意识形态中还存在无产阶级和资产阶级思想意识的矛盾在我国制造匈牙利事件，结果右派分子失算了。但是，他说，对于这些右派野心家还要密切注意，他们渗透在科学、文学、教育、新闻、工商等各个方面。他们企图在五百万知识分子中取得领导权。例如，罗隆基就曾经说共产党只能领导工人、农民和小知识分子，不能领导大知识分子。邵荃麟认为，知识分子应该提高警惕，认真地加强思想改造。
    章乃器在四川代表督促下，今天下午第一次参加小组会，在发言中强调他“从主观上检查不出有反党反社会主义”的思想，他还重弹了他“爱护党就像爱护自己的眼珠一样”的谰调。在讨论时，徐崇林揭露章乃器一贯政治品质恶劣，今天坚持走资本主义的道路不是偶然的。侯外庐指出章乃器是在装成领导者的姿态和马克思主义者的姿态在“检讨”，他要章乃器从资产阶级的根源上好好检查。
    江西省代表小组有几位劳动模范当场质问罗隆基是代表什么人在说话，罗隆基作为江西人民选出的代表，为什么忘了江西人民的委托。萍乡煤矿工人、工业劳动模范郭清泗说，萍乡煤矿工人有光荣的革命传统，谁要反对社会主义，工人是不答应的。农业劳动模范李友秀说，右派分子如果反对社会主义，他们是要跟右派分子拚命的。家乡在赣南革命老根据地的参加过长征的女代表危秀英说，革命老根据地人民不容许右派分子这样疯狂，他们一定要同右派分子斗争到底。危秀英质问罗隆基说，你的家乡就在革命老根据地，你怎么不了解江西人民的力量。
　　龙云否认少数民族的谬论同蒋介石的说法很相似
    云南代表小组连日来批驳龙云的错误言论。龙云在24日的小组会上的发言中，曾否认云南是多民族省份。他说，中国的少数民族自古以来并没有现在这么复杂，大家都是一个祖先。龙云还认为，少数民族既已自治，就应自力更生，不要依靠别人。龙云还说，在毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告发表以前，大家判别是非没有明确标准，因而现在说谁是右派谁是左派是不大好分的。龙云否认少数民族的谬论引起云南各少数民族代表的愤慨。云南省西双版纳傣族自治州副州长刀有良说，西双版纳的少数民族很早就定居并发展起来。1926年龙云任云南省主席时，下令撤销了西双版纳行政区改称专区，派来了伪县长搜刮民财。解放后，中国共产党重新恢复了西双版纳这个名字。刀有良说，中国共产党是我们少数民族的救星，祖国是我们的母亲，谁想使我们跟共产党和汉族人民分开是绝对办不到的。云南省人民委员会委员赵锺奇也反对龙云否定少数民族的看法，并列举历史事实加以驳斥。他说，假如按照龙云的说法，中国共产党的民族政策似乎可以取消了。北京大学教授马坚指出，龙云对少数民族的荒谬看法，同蒋介石在“中国之命运”一书中称中国各少数民族是汉族的大小宗支很相似。广播事业局局长梅益说，龙云埋怨毛主席的报告发表晚了，实质上是托词掩盖自己的错误。他说，从宪法上完全可以找出人民政治生活的基本准则，而通过宪法时龙云是举了手的。
    河南省代表小组批判了张云川的反社会主义言行。根据代表们的揭露，张云川一贯抹煞成绩，夸大缺点。他到河南地区视察工作以后，公然说“河南有80％的农民反对共产党”；秋收刚结束，家家有粮吃，他却说“民有菜色”。张云川在小组会上，不肯暴露自己的思想行动，竭力为自己的错误辩解。
　　黄绍竑、谭惕吾和林希翎有什么关系
　　湖南省代表要求他们澄清这个问题
    在湖南省代表小组，翦伯赞说，在右派分子向社会主义进攻的时候，中国人民大学有一个名叫林希翎的女学生到北京大学去作反社会主义的演说，闹得学校满城风雨。林希翎当时住在谭惕吾家里。翦伯赞要求谭惕吾澄清这件事。李哲人代表还揭露林希翎住在谭惕吾家里的时候，黄绍竑曾到那里同她谈了四个小时，林希翎回到学校继续煽动学生反对社会主义。
    在军队代表小组，今天有十位战斗英雄发言。他们认为，今后他们仍然要握紧枪杆警惕地保卫祖国建设和人民的利益。战斗英雄黄丑和、王有根、宋忠福、江雪山都谈到，过去南征北战，牺牲流血，就是为了争取建设社会主义。在战斗中，许多战友牺牲了，他们踏着烈士们的血迹前进，取得了胜利。代表们说，现在右派分子想来破坏胜利果实，这是绝对不能容许的。
    有的代表小组继续对章伯钧、黄绍竑、储安平等右派分子提出了批评。章伯钧今天仍然没有出席小组会。
　　党的民族政策成绩是巨大的
　　少数民族代表反击右派的离间活动
    甘肃、西藏、昌都、湖南、广西等小组，今天都有少数民族代表发言。这些代表对于周总理的报告，一致表示热诚拥护；许多代表认为党的民族政策成绩是巨大的。
    甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清（藏族），在发言中举出甘南藏族人民解放前后的生活情况得出结论说“没有共产党就没有民族团结”。他说，解放以前，甘南的甘家和青海的甲吾两个接邻的藏族部落，为了争夺草山，一到夏天就打仗。当时的国民党官员明里说来调停，实际上却在利用机会刮钱，结果仗还是继续打下去，一直打了三十五年，为此死了很多人，损失了牲畜一万多头。直到1951年，在共产党和人民政府的帮助下，两个部落的人民才解开了冤仇，团结起来了。他说，要是没有共产党领导，这是很难办到的事。
    在西藏、昌都代表小组会上，平错汪阶说，人民政府在短短几年内，摧毁了存在几千年的封建经济，建立了集体所有的经济制度，这是巨大的成就。去年的大灾荒能够顺利渡过，就是社会主义制度优越的明证。
    湖南省通道侗族自治县县长吴通行在小组会上介绍了这个县甘溪乡的三个农业生产合作社的农民经济情况。按照这个介绍，甘溪乡从1950年底解放以来农副业经济已有了很大发展。其中，三社的稻谷生产1956年比解放前分别增长了29％——35％，畜牧业分别增长了24％——26％，家禽分别增长了39％——61％。随着生产的发展，三个社的社员在1956年平均每人每年的收入比解放前分别提高了22％——30％，相反，农民的经济负担却大大减少了。如以1956年同1950年比，现贫农的经济负担减少了224％，老下中农的经济负担减少了157.8％，富农的经济负担减少了42.8％。吴通行说，这些情况证明周总理报告是实事求是的，那些右派分子制造所谓“人民生活没有改善”、“农民负担太重了”等等谎话，目的无非是想借此离间党和人民的关系，但是他们的企图是永远达不到的。
    广西省大苗山苗族自治县县长杨文贵说，大苗山解放前人民生活极为穷困，每年都要饿死不少人，而解放以后由于人民政府从财力、物力上帮助山区人民发展生产，已使人民不再受到饥饿的威胁，同时，这个过去没有文化的偏僻的山区不但已经有了许多初中毕业生，同时还出现了高中学生，这在大苗山历史上是空前的。他在谈了这些情况后向黄绍竑发问道：解放以后到底缺点是主要的还是成绩是主要的？
　　许多代表谈自己视察见闻：
　　这样伟大的事业只有在社会主义制度下才能实现
    在四川、江苏、陕西、河北等代表小组会上，许多代表还以他们视察所见和自己部门的工作情况，驳斥了资产阶级右派分子企图抹煞党和政府的工作成就的各种谬论。视察过鲁迅先生故乡绍兴的作家艾芜说，由于制酒等原因，绍兴从来就是缺粮的地方，平均每年总有三、四个月的粮食要由外地支援。但是，现在绍兴已变为余粮县，前年每亩平均收粮六百多斤，去年又增加到七百多斤。黄河水利委员会副主任李赋都谈到了我国根治黄河的伟大规划。他以他亲身的经验指出，这样伟大的事业，只有在社会主义制度下才能实现，在旧中国是根本没有办法的。河北省代表、子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀说，共产党领导农民实行了土地改革，她分到了五间瓦房、十多亩地，有吃有穿。去年闹了灾，农民没吃的，但有了合作社，又得到了政府的救济，大米、衣服什么都有。她问道：要是没有共产党怎么能有这样的美好生活呢？
    中华全国民主妇女联合会书记处书记罗琼、曹冠群，全总女工部儿童处处长李凤莲，在江苏、陕西两个代表小组会上，分别介绍妇女参加建设的情况，来驳斥右派分子。她们说，现在全国机关企业中的女职工人数已达三百万人，相当于建国初期的七倍。全国有四百名妇女当了拖拉机手。1956年区乡级的人民代表中，有22％是妇女，不少妇女担任了国家的高级领导工作和县长、乡长等职务。在农村方面，由于农业合作化解放了妇女劳动力，现在参加农业社的妇女全国已达一亿一千多万人。全国有70％以上的合作社中有了女社长，有60％的乡有了女乡长。她们指出，妇女社会地位的这种巨大变化是和共产党的领导分不开的。
　　勤俭建国必须形成社会风气  应该注意好好教育青年一代
    代表们在讨论中，还继续对政府工作提出了批评和建议。安徽、山西、青海、上海等代表小组在讨论中，有些代表建议政府要进一步教育人民警惕反革命分子的破坏活动。安徽省代表、农业生产合作社主任张会亭在发言中，以他自己今年被反革命分子毒害和反革命分子烧毁合作社粮食七千斤的事实，说明加强警惕性教育的必要性。青海省副省长札喜旺徐在发言中指出，青海省各族人民几年来是亲密团结的，但是反革命分子还在破坏这种团结，因此必须经常教育人民提高警惕，不要上反革命分子的当。
    在湖北省代表小组，今天许多代表发言还强调了勤俭建国的重要性。武汉市工业劳动模范彭仰钦说，听了总理的报告，越发感到我们这样一个国家当家不容易。武汉市电业，解放以来每年利润只能满足本企业扩建所需的30％；电业职工二千八百人，每年工资除外，生活福利支出三百几十万元，就占所创造财富的10％以上。总理说，全国每年增产的消费资料，平均每人只合四元，生产力就只有那么高，资金积累不容易。解决这个问题，不能靠空喊，更不能像右派分子站在高山顶上说风凉话，而是要努力勤俭建国。“把一切献给党”一书的作者吴运铎说，勤俭建国必须要形成社会风气，要从各方面加强教育。他说，现在有许多青年工人不知道革命和建设的艰苦，只知道讲排场，比阔气。他说他到过一个刚建好厂房的工厂，看见两个吃完西瓜的青年工人在比赛，说谁能拿西瓜皮打破玻璃窗。有的女工皮鞋买了十多双，每双都派了用场。这种风气很不好。作家曹禺说，我们应该好好教育青年一代。今天青年的生活和解放前比真是天上地下，但是他们没有吃过苦，不懂得今天的光明日子是那里来的。他说，有的青年竟然直截了当地找他问：怎样可以成名？这种青年，是不是可以算是“革命后的少爷”！有了这种思想，一不如意就会感觉不满，正好，右派言论就有了市场。武汉市工业劳动模范朱早弟说，对这样的青年，最好是让他们多了解旧社会的痛苦生活。中央气象局局长涂长望说，目前各方面的铺张浪费现象，也给青年很不好的影响，应该严厉批评和纠正这种铺张浪费现象。
