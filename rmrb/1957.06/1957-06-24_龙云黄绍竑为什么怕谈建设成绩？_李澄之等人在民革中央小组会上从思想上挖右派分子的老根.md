    Why are Long Yun and Huang Shaohong Afraid to Talk About Construction Achievements?
    Li Chengzhi and Others Ideologically Dug Up the Old Roots of Right-Wing Elements at the Central Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Small Group Meeting
    (Our Newspaper News) The enlarged meeting of the Central RCCK small group continued on the morning of the 23rd. Sixty-six people attended the meeting. Chen Shaokuan, Deng Baoshan, Li Chengzhi, Chen Li, Cao Bowen, Liu Mengchun, Zhao Zukang, Pei Changhui, and Zhu Yunshan spoke at the meeting.
    The meeting criticized the right-wing remarks of Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu. Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu, who were criticized, attended the symposium but did not speak.
    Li Chengzhi said in his speech that the common characteristic of all right-wing elements is to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party in various ways, attempting to restrict, weaken, and abolish the Party's leadership; secondly, right-wing elements try to obliterate the great achievements of China's socialist construction undertakings, looking for shortcomings and errors everywhere, and exaggerating and distorting them.
    He said that it is difficult for the people to understand why Huang Shaohong is so afraid to talk about the achievements of national construction. He said what does Huang Shaohong's emphasis on shortcomings mean? What is the difference between Huang Shaohong's attitude of negating objective facts and obliterating work achievements and Ge Peiqi's direct slander against the Communist Party and New China? It is difficult for people to see any essential difference in their attitude of hostility towards the Communist Party and New China.
    Li Chengzhi said that another prominent characteristic of right-wing elements is that they do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and regard the enemy as ourselves. What the broad masses consider to be the enemy, they consider to be friends. He said that in this regard, Huang Shaohong and Long Yun are also very obvious. For example, Huang Shaohong is actually speaking for counter-revolutionary elements. He questioned whether Huang Shaohong still has a people's standpoint? He demanded that Huang Shaohong thoroughly reflect and confess honestly.
    He said that Long Yun's anti-Soviet remarks and his anti-Soviet stance are extremely incompatible with the important responsibilities he bears in state organs and in the RCCK.
    Li Chengzhi finally said that many members of the RCCK were directly transformed from the reactionary ruling class in the past. He believes that it is necessary to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves and eliminate the remnants of reactionary thinking.
    Chen Li said in his speech that the mistakes made by the right-wing elements have developed from contradictions among the people to the edge of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and a solemn attitude must be adopted towards them. He said that in the years since liberation, we have been polite to these elements and have not severely criticized their mistakes. He revealed that when Long Yun was in the Southwest Military and Political Committee, he represented the landlord class and proposed that landlords should not return deposits, and if they had to return them, please the People's Government return them on behalf of the landlords. At that time, everyone opposed it, and Long Yun said that many landlords in Kunming had turned to industry and commerce, and landlords must return the deposits, and wait for the landlords to make money in a few years before returning them. Chen Li said that Long Yun lived in a daze for eight years, and all aspects of the country have changed, but he has remained unchanged.
    Chen Li cited the specific facts of his agency to refute the fallacy of expanding the shortcomings of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He said that there were more than 8,000 people in his agency, and more than 100 people were investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. As a result, more than 30 counter-revolutionary elements were found, more than 80 people clarified their history, and only four people were wrongly investigated. Based on this fact, he believes that it must not be said that the shortcomings of suppressing counter-revolutionaries outweigh the achievements.
    Chen Li also mentioned that in February of this year, an engineer from his agency went to pick up his wife. The train he was riding on was set off with explosives by counter-revolutionary elements, and as a result, both husband and wife were killed. Therefore, he reminded people not to think that the world is already peaceful and not to relax their vigilance against the enemy.

    龙云黄绍竑为什么怕谈建设成绩？
    李澄之等人在民革中央小组会上从思想上挖右派分子的老根
    本报讯　23日上午，民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行。到会的有六十六人。在会上发言的有陈绍宽、邓宝珊、李澄之、陈离、曹伯闻、刘孟纯、赵祖康、裴昌会、朱蕴山。
    会议对龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾等右派言论进行了批驳。受到批判的龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾出席了座谈会，他们没有发言。
    李澄之在发言中说，一切右派分子的共同特征就是以各种不同的说法来反对共产党的领导，企图限制、削弱和取消党的领导；其次右派分子力图抹煞我国各项社会主义建设事业的伟大成就，处处找寻缺点错误，加以夸大歪曲。
    他说，人民很难理解黄绍竑为什么那样怕谈国家建设的成绩，他说黄绍竑一味强调缺点究竟意味着什么？黄绍竑这种否定客观事实抹煞工作成绩的态度究竟与葛佩琦等人对于共产党、对于新中国的直接诬蔑，又有什么不同之处，人们很难看出他们敌视共产党、敌视新中国的态度有什么本质上的差别。
    李澄之说，右派分子的另一突出特点就是不分敌我，认敌为我。广大群众认为是敌人的，他们却认为是朋友。他说，在这方面黄绍竑和龙云等也是表现得极为明显的。如黄绍竑实际上就是在替反革命分子说话。他质问黄绍竑还有没有人民立场？他要求黄绍竑彻底反省，坦白交代。
    他说，龙云发表反苏言论，他的反苏立场是与他在国家机关和在民革所负的重要责任极不相容的。
    李澄之最后说，民革成员有不少是直接由过去的反动统治阶级转过来的，他认为划清敌我界限，清除反动思想残余是十分必要的。
    陈离在发言中说，右派分子们所犯的错误，已由人民内部矛盾发展到敌我矛盾的边沿，要对他们采取严正的态度。他说，解放后几年来，我们对这些分子都是客客气气，没有对他们的错误进行过严厉的批评。他揭发龙云在西南军政委员会时，就曾代表地主阶级提出不要地主退押，如果要退就请人民政府代地主退的荒谬主张。当时大家提出反对，龙云又说昆明的很多地主已转到工商业方面去了，一定要地主退押，等过几年地主们赚了钱再退。陈离说，龙云糊里糊涂过了八年，国家各方面都变了样，他还是原封未动。
    陈离引用了他所在机关的具体事实，驳斥了那种扩大肃反缺点的谬论。他说他所在的机关有八千多人，肃反中有一百多人被审查，结果查出三十多名反革命分子，有八十多人弄清了历史，仅有四人是审查错了。他以这种事实作为根据，认为决不能说肃反缺点大于成绩。
    陈离还谈到，今年2月间，他所在的机关的一名工程师去接妻子，回来所乘的火车被反革命分子放上炸弹，结果夫妇均被炸死。因此他提醒人们，不要认为现在天下已经太平，不要放松对敌人的警惕。
