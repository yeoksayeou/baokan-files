Spoke the "Truth"

　　On May 31st, Comrade Zhang Naiqi gave a speech at the National Experience Exchange Conference on Socialist Transformation Work of Industry and Commerce sponsored by the China Democratic National Construction Association. He first mentioned that “This conference is going very well because everyone has spoken the truth.” Indeed, Comrade Naiqi had previously told many lies, and this time he also told some “truths.” This is a very good thing. Comrade Naiqi said that "Bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism"; he also said that there is no "essential difference" between members of the bourgeoisie and the working class. This exposes the class essence of his thought. Let us now analyze the substance of his thought.

　　The Standard of Right and Wrong – Socialism

　　Comrade Naiqi likes to talk about "distinguishing right from wrong." Confusing right and wrong or reversing right and wrong is not good, and we should resolutely oppose it. However, his standard of right and wrong is different from others. For example, he said that Comrade Li Kangnian's suggestion "is hastily pursuing socialism," but Mr. Chen Shutong said: "This kind of idea of gaining both fame and wealth is purely bourgeois thinking." He said that "bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism," and we say that capitalism is more dangerous than bureaucracy. He said that there is no "essential difference" between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. We say that there is an essential difference between these two classes. He said that fixed interest is not exploitation, and we say that fixed interest is exploitation, and so on. It can be seen that his so-called right and wrong are different from our right and wrong. We can only have one standard of right and wrong, not a second one, and that is the "establishment of a socialist society" and the "socialist transformation" of capitalist industry and commerce as stipulated in the Constitution. The ideology that guides us is socialist ideology, not capitalist ideology.

　　Is "Bureaucracy More Dangerous Than Capitalism"?

　　He believes that "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism. ... If socialist enterprises are combined with bureaucracy, then their efficiency will be lower than that of capitalist enterprises. ... But capitalism also has good and bad aspects. ... Capitalists, in order to make profits, are good at selecting talents, and they also try to show fairness in the training and promotion of talents." We believe that capitalism is much better than feudalism, but much worse than socialism. Socialism has all the advantages of capitalism; however, capitalism does not have the advantages of socialism. Capitalists talk about "efficiency" in terms of how to increase the "efficiency" of exploitation. His selection of talents, training, and promotion of talents are all for the purpose of increasing his exploitation, which is completely different from the purpose of socialism. Socialism is more particular about efficiency than capitalism; it is truly good at selecting talents, training, and promoting talents. Why do we do this? It is to increase the happiness of the people.

　　Bureaucracy is a product of past class societies. Capitalism produces a large amount of bureaucracy. Because the rule of previous class societies was always the rule of a minority; not only did they not care about the lives of the people, but they also oppressed the majority of the people. This inevitably led to bureaucracy. Socialism is the rule of the vast majority over the minority, and therefore it opposes bureaucracy. The way to oppose bureaucracy is to promote democracy and give full play to democracy. Which capitalist country dares to oppose bureaucracy in this way? Isn't it only in today's working-class-led country that a movement against bureaucracy can be launched? Therefore, we believe that capitalism is more dangerous than bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is bad, but capitalism is even worse.

　　Is there no "Essential Difference" between Bourgeois Elements and Working-Class Elements?

　　He said: "There is an essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, that is, one is an exploiting class, and the other is a non-exploiting and anti-exploiting class. But it cannot be said that there is an essential difference between the members of these two classes." He also said, "Every class has two sides, and the working class also has two sides, but the proportion of positive and negative aspects is different, which is a matter of being advanced or backward."

　　We know that in past class societies, people belonged to classes, and the characteristics of classes also determined the characteristics of people; individuals can break away from that class, but before breaking away, it cannot be said that they have no relationship with that class. There are bourgeois elements who participate in the revolution and become socialists. However, they are no longer bourgeois elements but belong to the working class. Bourgeois elements can be transformed into self-sufficient laborers. However, before they have completely transformed into self-sufficient laborers, it cannot be said that they are not bourgeois elements. When all bourgeois elements have been transformed, the bourgeoisie will also be eliminated. Comrade Naiqi believes that the bourgeoisie as a class and bourgeois elements can be completely separated, which is a strange argument.

　　Since there is an essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, there is of course an essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. Capitalists are exploiters, and exploitation must have an object of exploitation, that is, laborers. One side exploits people, and the other side is exploited by people. Isn't this an essential difference?

　　Comrade Naiqi believes that the working class also has two sides, that is, the advanced and the backward sides. Yes, there is a distinction between the backward and the advanced in the working class, and therefore there is the vanguard of the working class – the Communist Party; however, the essential demand of the working class is socialism. And no matter whether national bourgeois elements have advanced or backward differences, their class demand is to develop capitalism. Therefore, Comrade Naiqi's saying that "every class has two sides" is wrong.

　　Is Fixed Interest Not Exploitation?

　　Comrade Naiqi believes that "fixed interest should not be said to be exploitation, but should be said to be income without labor." It seems that income without labor sounds better than exploitation. Then wouldn't it sound even better to say that capital is one of the three elements of production? This is not a matter of sounding good or bad, but a matter of fact.

　　We want to tell Comrade Naiqi that fixed interest is a part of surplus value, taken from the working class. Naturally, fixed interest is the state's redemption of the means of production of capitalists, but its nature of exploitation does not change because of this.

　　I agree that some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen who receive little fixed interest are willing to give up fixed interest voluntarily. However, large industrialists and businessmen should consider their political influence and should not harm the interests of the entire country for personal gain.

　　Bourgeois Standpoint

　　Comrade Naiqi has four arguments in this speech: first, bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism; second, every class has two sides; third, there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements; fourth, fixed interest is not exploitation. I think these arguments are all wrong, and the errors are very serious. Why does Comrade Naiqi have these errors? Because he is stubbornly standing on the bourgeois standpoint. This is a fundamental problem. We say that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the bourgeois standpoint, which also needs to be transformed. We must never stubbornly stand on the bourgeois standpoint; we must gradually change this standpoint, and our standpoint must also progress with the progress of our ideological transformation.

　　Because Comrade Naiqi stubbornly stands on the bourgeois standpoint, he naturally wants to cherish capitalism and demands to take the capitalist road; naturally, he only sees the good of capitalism and only sees the bad of socialism. Comrade Naiqi's thinking is representative. He represents a part of the backward national bourgeois elements who resist socialist transformation. As far as the majority of bourgeois elements are concerned, he represents the negative side of the national bourgeoisie. However, the positive side of the national bourgeoisie is growing, and the negative side is decreasing. Therefore, Comrade Naiqi's opinions do not resonate with most people within the national bourgeoisie.

　　Comrade Naiqi likes to advise others to "examine their thoughts," which is very good. Each of us should take this opportunity to examine our own thoughts. We need to examine whether there are any ideas in our thoughts that are similar to Zhang Naiqi's? How much capitalist component is there? We must bravely and diligently overcome our own capitalist ideas and gradually establish socialist ideas.

　　章乃器思想的阶级本质
　　施复亮
    说了“真话”
    5月31日，在中国民主建国会全国工商改造辅导工作座谈会上，章乃器同志作了一次讲话。他首先谈到“这次座谈会开得很好，因大家都说了真话。”的确，乃器同志以前说了不少假话，这次也说了一些“真话”。这是很好的事。乃器同志说“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险”；又说资产阶级与工人阶级“的分子不能说有本质的区别”。这是暴露他的思想的阶级本质。我们现在就来分析他的思想实质吧。
    是非的标准——社会主义
    乃器同志很欢喜说“明是非”。混淆是非或颠倒是非是不好的，我们应该坚决反对。但他的是非标准和别人的是非标准是不同的。例如他说李康年同志的建议“是过急地追求社会主义”，但是陈叔通先生说：“这种名利双收的想法，是十足的资产阶级的思想”；他说“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险”，我们说，资本主义比官僚主义更危险；他说资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子没有“本质的区别”，我们说这两个阶级的分子有本质的区别；他说定息不是剥削，我们说定息是剥削，诸如此类。可见他的所谓是非跟我们的是非是不同的了。我们的是非标准，只能有一个，不能有第二个，这就是宪法上明文规定我们要“建立社会主义社会”，对于资本主义工商业要进行“社会主义改造”。领导我们的思想是社会主义思想，不是资本主义思想。
    “官僚主义是比资本主义更危险”吗？
    他认为“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人。……如果社会主义企业加上官僚主义，那它的效率就将比资本主义企业低。……但资本主义也有好有坏，……资本家为了图利，善于选用人才，并且对人才的培养、提拔，还要尽量表示公平。”我们认为，资本主义比封建主义要好得多，但比社会主义要坏得多。资本主义的好处，社会主义都有；但是社会主义的好处，资本主义却没有。资本家讲“效率”，是怎样可以增加剥削的“效率”。他的选用人才，培养、提拔人才，都是为着怎样增加他的剥削，这和社会主义的目的是完全不同的。社会主义是比资本主义更讲究效率的；真正善于选用人才，培养、提拔人才的。为什么要这样做？为的是要增加人民的幸福。
    官僚主义是过去阶级社会的产物。资本主义就产生大量的官僚主义。因为以前阶级社会的统治，总是少数人的统治；不但不关心人民的生活，而且是压迫多数人民的。这就必然产生官僚主义。社会主义是绝大多数人对少数人的统治，因而才反对官僚主义。反对官僚主义的办法，就是发扬民主，充分发扬民主。试问哪个资本主义国家敢于这样反对官僚主义？不是在今天工人阶级领导的国家能够发动反对官僚主义的运动吗？所以我们认为资本主义比官僚主义更危险。官僚主义是不好，资本主义更不好。
    资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子没有“本质的区别”吗？
    他说：“资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，即一是剥削阶级，一是不剥削和反剥削的阶级。但这两个阶级的分子不能说有本质的区别。”他又说，“哪个阶级都有两面性，工人阶级也有，只不过积极、消极两面的比重大小不同，这是一个先进和落后的问题。”
    我们知道，在过去的阶级社会里，人是属于阶级的，阶级的特性也决定了人的特性；个人可以脱离那个阶级，但在未脱离以前不能说与那个阶级没有关系。资产阶级分子是有人参加革命的，而且变成社会主义者。但，那已不是资产阶级分子而属于工人阶级了。资产阶级分子是可以转变为自食其力的劳动者的。但，在他没有完全转变为自食其力的劳动者以前，还不能说他不是资产阶级分子。当资产阶级分子都转变完了，资产阶级也就消灭了。乃器同志以为资产阶级这个阶级和资产阶级分子可以完全脱离，这是怪论。
    资产阶级既然与工人阶级有本质的区别，资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子当然也有本质的区别。资本家是剥削者，剥削一定要有剥削对象，那就是劳动者。一方是剥削人，一方是受人剥削，这不是本质的区别吗？
    乃器同志认为工人阶级也有两面性，就是先进和落后的两面。是的，工人阶级是有落后与先进的区别，因此才有工人阶级的先锋队——共产党的存在；但是，工人阶级的本质要求是社会主义。而民族资产阶级分子无论有先进与落后的区别，其阶级要求都是发展资本主义。所以乃器同志说“哪个阶级都有两面性”，是错误的。
    定息不是剥削吗？
    乃器同志认为“不应该把定息说成剥削，而应说成是不劳而获的收入”。似乎不劳而获要比剥削好听，那末说资本是生产三要素之一，那不是更好听吗？这不是好听不好听的问题，而是事实问题。
    我们要告诉乃器同志，定息是剩余价值的一部分，从工人阶级身上取来的。自然，定息是国家对资本家生产资料的赎买，但它的剥削性质，并不因此而变。
    有些中小工商业者拿的定息不多，自动愿意放弃定息，我是同意的。但是大工商业者，就要考虑他的政治影响，不应该以个人利益而妨害整个国家的利益。
    资产阶级立场
    乃器同志在这篇讲话里有四个论点：第一，官僚主义比资本主义更危险；第二，哪个阶级都有两面性；第三，资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子没有本质的区别；第四，定息不是剥削。这些论点我认为都是错误的，而且错误是很严重的。为什么乃器同志会有这些错误呢？因为他死死地站在资产阶级立场。这是一个根本问题。我们说，资本主义工商业者进行社会主义改造，就是资产阶级立场，也是要改造的。我们决不应该死死地站在资产阶级立场，我们要逐步地改变这个立场，随着我们思想改造的进步，我们的立场也要跟着进步。
    乃器同志因为死死地站在资产阶级立场，所以自然要留恋资本主义，要求走资本主义的道路；自然他只看见资本主义的好，只看见社会主义的坏。乃器同志的这种思想是有代表性的，他是代表一部分落后的、抵抗社会主义改造的民族资产阶级分子的。就大多数资产阶级分子来说，他是代表民族资产阶级消极的一面。但是，民族资产阶级积极的一面正在增长，消极的一面正在减少。所以乃器同志的意见，得不到民族资产阶级内部大部分人的共鸣。
    乃器同志爱劝别人“检查思想”，这是很好的。我们每个人都要趁此机会检查一下自己的思想。我们要检查自己的思想中，有类似章乃器的思想没有？有多少资本主义成份？我们要勇敢地努力地克服自己的资本主义思想，逐步树立社会主义思想。
