(Reported by this newspaper) An enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) continued on the morning of June 8th. The meeting was presided over by Li Jishen, Chairman of the RCCK Central Committee.

    Wang Kunlun said: If you are allowed to "放" (let go) but I am not, if you are allowed to criticize the Communist Party but the Communist Party is not allowed to criticize you, then right and wrong cannot be distinguished.

    Wang Kunlun said in his speech that anyone who makes suggestions should speak truthfully based on their own understanding, but others should also be allowed to criticize their criticisms.

    Fully "放" (letting go) and "鸣" (speaking out) is what both inside and outside the Party want to implement. However, since everyone is to fully "放", and all kinds of opinions can be put forward, different views will arise on the same issue. For example, regarding the various movements in recent years, some people think they have been done very well, while others think they have been done terribly; again, regarding national construction, some people think that achievements are the main thing, while others think that shortcomings are the main thing; some people think that most Communist Party members are good, while others think that most are bad. This naturally raises the question of which opinion conforms to the facts and which does not, that is, the question of right and wrong. Internal contradictions among the people can only be properly resolved by distinguishing between right and wrong. If only one side's views are allowed to be expressed, and the other side's views are not allowed; if you are allowed to "放" but I am not; if you are allowed to criticize the Communist Party but the Communist Party is not allowed to criticize you, then right and wrong cannot be distinguished, the problem cannot be analyzed objectively and comprehensively, and ideological confusion will be caused. We should say "yes" when we see something right and say "no" when we see something wrong. This is called being honest, this is called being loyal, and this is in line with the spirit of "放" and "鸣". Otherwise, it is not a full "放" and "鸣".

    Now, in the spirit of "争鸣" (contention), I would like to raise two questions:

    Chu Anping's statement about the "Party's world" distorts the facts.

    1.  Is it a "Party's world" and "uniformity"? Mr. Chu Anping said: The poor relationship between the Party and the masses is due to the Communist Party's idea of a "Party's world", which has led to the current situation of one family dominating the world in a uniform way. After hearing this, I immediately thought of "the Jiang family's world and the Chen family's party" before liberation, which was what people hated about the reactionary regime at the time. Many of our RCCK comrades had fought hard for many years to oppose the Jiang family's dominance and eliminate dissidents, and to overthrow that "Party's world". However, after liberation, in the new China of people's democracy, is it still a "Party's world"? Has the Communist Party created a uniform situation again? Let the facts answer!

    In people's congresses, CPPCC, government organs, enterprises, culture and education, news and publishing, and other institutions at all levels, a large number of non-Party people participate. At the beginning of liberation, Chairman Mao proposed the policy of "包下来" (taking over) the civil servants of the Kuomintang government who remained on the mainland. To this day, there are still many figures from the Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang government, and the Kuomintang government in governments at all levels. Our various democratic parties and non-party democrats participate in the government under the leadership of the Communist Party, and there is a multi-party coalition government led by the Communist Party, regardless of whether it is in power or in opposition. Is this a "uniform" situation?

    Zhang Bojun's speech can easily be understood as implying that many major guidelines and policies have not been discussed through political consultation and the NPC. If it is said that many major events are decided by the Communist Party and non-Party people have no say, this does not conform to the facts.

    I also want to say a few words in connection with Mr. Zhang Bojun's speech. Mr. Zhang Bojun said: "In the future, we can listen to opinions from all sides on major issues concerning the country's policies and guidelines... If we listen more to the opinions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the CPPCC, and the democratic parties at the beginning of the work, we can avoid detours." "For example, the issue of the national system and the division of power between the central and local governments was only discussed by local party secretaries and a few senior non-Party cadres last year. It was mainly discussed within the Party. We should use the various committees of the CPPCC and the NPC, and the democratic parties to discuss..." He also said, "Now there are many design institutes in the industrial field, but there are no design institutes for many political facilities. I think the CPPCC, the NPC, the democratic parties, and people's organizations should be political design institutes." I personally disagree with this view. Mr. Zhang Bojun's statement can easily lead people to understand that since the founding of the country, many major guidelines and policies have not been discussed through political consultation and the NPC, and that democratic parties have no say in major issues such as the national system.

    We have the NPC, the Standing Committee of the NPC, and the CPPCC. Some of these are organs of power, and some are organs of consultation. According to the provisions of the Constitution, all matters that should be discussed there are discussed there. We see that when the country was founded, the Common Program was jointly adopted, and the CPPCC was jointly established. Looking at the major movements such as the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the land reform, and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, have they not been negotiated and decided by the organs of power? Have the Regulations on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Land Reform Law, the Marriage Law, the Military Service Law, the General Line, the Five-Year Plan, the national budget and final accounts, and other major laws and regulations not been negotiated, and have matters that should be discussed in the NPC not been discussed? Who can forget how our draft constitution went through extensive nationwide discussions and was revised many times? Can this be said to be a one-party monopoly? Regarding the issue of the national system, how many days were discussed in Beijing, Qingdao, and Beidaihe last year? How many people participated? Therefore, if it is said that many major events are decided by the Communist Party and non-Party people have no say, it does not conform to the facts. We should say that socialist democracy still needs to be expanded, and the strength of non-Party people still needs to be fully utilized, but if we think that many major national system issues were not consulted with democratic parties in advance, resulting in many major mistakes, does this conform to the facts?

    As for the political design institute, I don't understand it. The NPC is an organ of power. Is there to be another organ of power within this organ of power? Or are some experts to be convened for research and reference, or are several organs of power and consultation to be combined into another organ? It is not very clear. I think that as long as we give full play to our strength in the NPC, the Standing Committee of the NPC, and the CPPCC, and as long as policies are put forward for full discussion, we can expand socialist democracy and give greater play to the role of non-Party people. Were the more than 400 speeches at this CPPCC not enough? Based on the above, can it be said that our country's major decisions, plans, and laws are monopolized by the Communist Party's world?

    Is this kind of extensive democracy, which has never been seen in ancient or modern times, and in China or abroad, the kind of democracy that can be obtained under feudalism and capitalism? Is this what people under the "Jiang family's world and the Chen family's party" could get?

    Last year, the CPC put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend", "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision", and Chairman Mao also put forward the policy of "Overall planning, appropriate arrangements, everything starting from 600 million people" when talking about the issue of internal contradictions among the people. He also said that long-term cooperation with non-Party people is forever unchangeable and fixed. Under such guidelines and policies, can it be said that it is a "Party's world", "uniform"? Recently, the CPC has voluntarily requested all sectors outside the Party to help the Party rectify its work, and has called for "大放" (great letting go) and "大鸣" (great speaking out), forming this unprecedented and extensive democracy. Is this the kind of democracy that feudalism and capitalism can imagine? Is this what people who lived under the "Jiang family's world and the Chen family's party" could dream of? It is a fact that the relationship between the Party and the masses is not good in some places, and that there is sectarianism among Party members, which must be corrected. And it is believed that it can be corrected through the opinions and help of all sectors of the country, so it is necessary to rectify the work style. However, if it is said that the Communist Party has the idea of a "Party's world" because there is sectarianism among Party members, it does not conform to the facts. Mr. Chu Anping said: "The ideological problem of this 'Party's world' is the ultimate source of all sectarianism and the fundamental contradiction between the Party and non-Party people." However, judging from the well-known facts mentioned above, how can it be proved that the Communist Party's policies and guidelines are based on the idea of a "Party's world"? The Communist Party is the leading core of the country, which is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. If it is said that the Communist Party is in charge, it is a "Party's world", then does that mean that the leadership of the Party must be abolished in order to eliminate sectarianism? If it is said that the contradiction between the Party and non-Party people cannot be resolved as long as there is a Party, then does that mean that all political parties must be dissolved?

    Among the various opinions, some are obviously wrong. These opinions should not restrict others from raising them, nor should they restrict others from opposing them.

    2.  Is the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism needed? It should be said that the vast majority of non-Party people are helping the Party rectify its work out of love for the country and the Party. Not only should Party members humbly listen to and correct their shortcomings, but I believe it is also welcomed by the people of the whole country. Because the interests of the Party and the people are consistent, and because their purpose is to strengthen and consolidate the leadership of the Communist Party and better realize socialism. However, among the various opinions, some are obviously wrong. Some people want the Communist Party to withdraw from here and abandon there. Some people propose that the Communist Party withdraw from schools, that public representatives be withdrawn from joint public-private enterprises, that Marxism-Leninism not be used as a guiding ideology, and that bureaucratism is more dangerous than capitalism, and so on. If so, is the leadership of the Party needed? Is socialism needed? Such opinions have sparked heated discussions and debates in schools, enterprises, and society. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, and there should be no restrictions. These opinions should not restrict others from raising them, nor should they restrict others from opposing them.

    The speeches of Wang Dezhou and Ge Peiqi are infuriating.

    What cannot but make people feel indignant is that some people gnash their teeth at the Party, as if they have some deep-seated hatred. Wang Dezhou, a lecturer at Renmin University, said: "Now 90% of the Party members are engaged in sectarianism, and even do all kinds of evil." He also said: "It is okay to set up machine guns to make trouble, but the trouble is that they are afraid that the machine guns will turn around and hit them." Ge Peiqi said: "If it is done well, it is okay; if it is not done well, the masses can overthrow you, kill the Communists, and overthrow you. This cannot be said to be unpatriotic, because the Communists do not serve the people. If the Communist Party perishes, China will not perish...."

    Comrades! Listen to what kind of people's wishes and voices these are! To say that "90% of Communist Party members do all kinds of evil" is true. What they have done is "evil" in opposing imperialism, "evil" in eliminating the landlord class, and "evil" in eliminating counter-revolutionaries! Indeed, the Communist Party has done some things that are more "bad" than the Kuomintang. It is "bad" in opposing American imperialism, "bad" in eliminating exploitation, "bad" in liberating Taiwan, "bad" in increasing China's steel production from 900,000 tons to 4.5 million tons, and "bad" in building China into a socialist country. However, these "evils" of the Communist Party are precisely the "good" in the eyes of the people, and these "bad" things are precisely the "good" in the eyes of the people. If someone wants to kill the Communists, there is no need to set up machine guns. The people will pick up their hoes and sledgehammers.

    The broad masses of people are able to distinguish who is sincerely helping the Communist Party rectify its work and who is confusing right and wrong and reversing black and white.

    Gentlemen, wake up! Those who oppose socialist China and fantasize about the collapse of the Communist Party are those who harbor class hatred and American imperialism. Please take a look at the great achievements of national construction and listen to the patriotic and Party-loving voices of the broad masses of people.

    The eyes of the broad masses of people across the country, the democratic parties, and all patriotic intellectuals are discerning. They are able to distinguish who is sincerely helping the Communist Party rectify its work and eliminate the "three evils", and who is confusing right and wrong and reversing black and white. Rectification is the demand of the Communist Party, and helping rectification is the responsibility of the democratic parties. We have shared weal and woe with the Communist Party in the past, and now we are closely related to the Communist Party. We should adhere to the spirit of loving the Party, insist on "放" and "鸣", "knowing everything and saying everything", and continue to criticize the shortcomings of the CPC. Only in this way can we be worthy of our friends and fulfill our strength.

    Wu Maosun said: We should support Lu Yuwen. Someone is using anonymous letters to intimidate him, obviously trying to take advantage of loopholes and sabotage the rectification movement.

    Wu Maosun said in his speech that we have all seen today's People's Daily editorial. Lu Yuwen's speech was made in the RCCK Central Committee Group, and he received an anonymous threatening letter because of this. I would also like to discuss this issue in the RCCK Central Committee Group.

    It is possible to disagree with what Lu Yuwen said, but he cannot be forbidden to say it, let alone be forced to say that he is telling lies. Otherwise, that would be subjectivism.

    Lu Yuwen's slightest positive remark was met with the despicable means of writing anonymous letters, saying that he was "shameless" and "an accomplice of a tyrant". This cannot but arouse people's indignation and protest.

    Regarding the issue of having position but no power raised by Lu Yuwen, I think his analysis has a certain truth and cannot be dismissed with a single stroke. He said that he gets along well with Party members, which is of course possible. Why can it only be false and not true? This is too unconvincing.

    Regarding the issue of having position but no power, I think it is like the problem of walls and ditches, which comes from two aspects. On the one hand, some Party members have sectarian emotions or low intellectual level; on the other hand, from the perspective of our non-Party people, there are also many things worth checking and improving in our work style, ideological level, and professional level. On the one hand, we must help the Communist Party overcome the shortcomings of sectarianism, and on the other hand, we must strive to improve ourselves. Only in this way can we truly solve the problem of having position but no power. The current situation is that the problem of having position but no power is relatively common and serious; however, the situation where the Party and non-Party people cooperate well is also equally existing. We cannot deny everything.

    I think that Lu Yuwen's words cannot be dismissed with a single stroke, and it cannot be said that what he said hinders "鸣放" (speaking out). Of course, his opinions can still be discussed. Someone wrote an anonymous letter to intimidate him, obviously trying to take advantage of loopholes and sabotage the rectification movement. We should also support him.

    Xu Baoju, Chen Shaoxian, Qin Yizhi, and Liu Fei also spoke at the meeting.

    Zhu Xuefan said: The premise of "放" and "鸣" is to consolidate the leadership of the Party, and capitalist ideology cannot be allowed to attack socialist ideology. If it wants to attack, we will counterattack.

    Zhu Xuefan said that the premise of "放" and "鸣" is to consolidate the leadership of the Party and to enable the socialist cause to achieve greater achievements. This is also the wish of democratic parties and non-Party people. Everyone dares to express opinions, and this atmosphere is very good. Everyone is starting from the love of the Party, and this should be developed and cultivated. Since it is a "大放" (great letting go) and "大鸣" (great speaking out), both criticism and counter-criticism are possible. Only in this way can we find the truth and distinguish right from wrong.

    Zhu Xuefan said that recently he saw some articles and speeches in the newspapers, and he had some doubts, doubting whether they started from the wish to consolidate the leadership of the Party and build socialism better. He said that the speeches of Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou, lecturers at Renmin University of China, reversed black and white and fabricated facts. Ge Peiqi once said that "today's common people are 'respecting gods and staying away from them'" to the Communist Party. He didn't know who he was referring to as "common people". Why didn't Ge Peiqi go to see the workers and peasants? Zhu Xuefan said that he did not believe that today's Chinese workers, peasants, young students, intellectuals, and national capitalists were "respecting gods and staying away from them" from the Communist Party. At the same time, he pointed out that Wang Dezhou's claim that 90% of Party members were doing all kinds of evil was also unfounded. We have cooperated with the CPC for so long and have seen that the Communist Party has shortcomings and mistakes, and that many things can be done better, but they have been done badly. However, is it fair to obliterate all the facts? I don't think it's fair. It seems that these gentlemen want to overthrow all the achievements that the Party has led the people to achieve.

    Zhu Xuefan said: Ge Peiqi said that even without the Chinese Communist Party, people would not betray the country. But everyone will not forget that in history, which of the former Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang warlords, Yuan Shikai, and Chiang Kai-shek did not betray the country? If you have forgotten, you can also take a look at the situation in Taiwan today. I completely disagree with this statement. He said that Ge Peiqi's remarks may be a momentary impulse. Because I cannot believe that senior intellectuals would make such remarks.

    Zhu Xuefan believes that the comrades of the democratic parties have a responsibility to correct these erroneous views. He quoted Chairman Mao's words: All remarks and actions that deviate from socialism are wrong.

    Zhu Xuefan said that in this "大放大鸣" (great letting go, great speaking out), there seems to be a struggle between two different ideologies: capitalist ideology and socialist ideology. It is necessary to point out which aspect some views belong to and not confuse the public. Capitalist ideology cannot be allowed to attack socialist ideology. If it wants to attack, we will counterattack. Today's socialist ideology is the dominant ideology, and the socialist road is a sure road. Do not forget the first article of the Constitution: The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. I will oppose any remarks or actions that deviate from this article, and everyone else will oppose them.

    Zhu Xuefan said that after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, in the great cause of socialist construction in a country of 600 million people, and in the vigorous social reform, there is not enough experience, and many things are creative. No one can guarantee that they will not make mistakes. It is such a great joy that the Party has discovered this and wants to rectify its work! Everyone should be brave to speak out and sincerely present all their opinions. It cannot be guaranteed that no more mistakes will be made in the future, so "放" and "鸣" must continue. If there are mistakes, they will be pointed out, and if there are shortcomings, they will be pointed out, so that we can make fewer mistakes, and if there are mistakes, they can be corrected as soon as possible.

    The regime is led by the Party, but there should be a clear division of labor between the Party and the government.

    Finally, Zhu Xuefan criticized the Party on the issues of the Party substituting for the government, the views on the old personnel, and the legal system. He said that the regime is led by the Party, but there should be a clear division of labor between the Party and the government. The Party's policies should be made into resolutions, orders, and instructions by government organs for implementation. There was no experience in this regard in the past. He took the decision on the issue of newspaper distribution as an example. The Party group of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications reported this issue to the Party Central Committee, which made a decision and issued it to the local Party committees, which in turn told the Party members in the postal and telecommunications departments. This was divorced from the administrative system and weakened the strength of the administrative system. He hoped that the issue of the division of labor between the Party and the government would be studied in this rectification. Zhu Xuefan proposed that the progressive side of the old personnel should be estimated. Most of them served in the Kuomintang government in the past for the sake of life. In the past, they were seen more from the perspective of backwardness and less from the perspective of progress. Walls and ditches in many places occurred in the views on them. However, they have all made progress in the past eight years. Now is the time to re-evaluate them and break down barriers. He also made suggestions on the calculation method of the retirement age of机关干部 (government officials). Finally, he made suggestions on the legal system.

    Li Junlong said: That kind of behavior of writing anonymous threatening letters is an extremely dishonest and despicable behavior. People with different opinions should stand up and speak out openly.

    1.  Helping the CPC to rectify its work is to rectify the three malpractices that exist in the work of some Communist Party members, so as to further consolidate the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party among the 600 million people, and certainly not to weaken the leadership of the CPC, let alone to break away from the leadership of the CPC. Because accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is agreed by the people of the whole country and has been historically proven to be in line with the highest interests of the people of the whole country.

    2.  Helping the CPC to rectify its work is to rectify the three malpractices that hinder the progress of the socialist cause, which is more conducive to the progress of the socialist cause, and certainly not to break away from the socialist road. Because the socialist road is the road chosen by the people of the whole country, and leaving this road means leaving the revolutionary road.

    3.  However, it should be distinguished: criticizing the CPC, as long as it is well-intentioned, based on facts, and honest, should be regarded as a good friend who truly loves the Communist Party, and should not be mistaken for opposing the Communist Party. Similarly, if one knows that there are some mistakes and shortcomings in the work of some Communist Party members but refuses to say so, and only says some nice things, then it is not the attitude that a decent person who truly loves the Communist Party should take. Because the Chinese Communist Party bears the main responsibility for the country, and we are closely related to the Communist Party and share weal and woe. We should be honest, know everything and say everything. Helping the Communist Party is helping ourselves.

    4.  Democracy requires the demeanor of tolerating different opinions, and socialist democracy must accept the leadership of the working class. In the process of helping the CPC carry out rectification, it is necessary to allow criticism of the Communist Party, and also to allow counter-criticism of the critics. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism, and critics who are in line with the facts should not be afraid of counter-criticism. Our current policy is the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" and "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by Chairman Mao, not "One flower blooms alone" and "One family sings alone". We should learn to listen to different opinions. As for those who write anonymous threatening letters, it is an extremely dishonest and despicable behavior. We agree with the People's Daily's stern condemnation of such people. People with different opinions should stand up and speak out openly.

    5.  We should continue to adhere to the policy of "放" and "鸣", and we should protect this atmosphere of opening up avenues of speech. So that everyone can say what they want to say, and turn these opinions into positive suggestions, so that after rectification, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party among the people of the whole country will be further consolidated, all forces that can be united will be united, and all positive factors will be mobilized, so that our great socialist cause can be promoted more smoothly.

### 民革中央小组扩大会议批判错误言论

    民革中央小组扩大会议批判错误言论
    本报讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央小组扩大会议于6月8日上午继续举行。会议由民革中央主席李济深主持。
    王昆仑说：如果只允许你放不允许我放，只许你批评共产党，不许共产党批评你，就不能分清是非。
    王昆仑在发言中说，任何人提意见都应本着自己的认识实事求是地说，但也应该允许人家对你的批评提出批评。
    充分地“放”和“鸣”是党内党外所一致要贯彻的。不过，既是大家要充分放，各种各样意见都可提出，就会对同样问题发生不同看法。例如对几年来的各种运动，有人认为搞得很好，有人认为搞得很糟；再如国家建设有人认为成绩是主要的，有人认为缺点是主要的；有人认为共产党员多数是好的，也有人认为多数是坏的。这就自然发生了那种意见符合事实，那种意见不合事实，也就是发生了是和非的问题。人民内部矛盾就靠分清是非才能得到正确处理。如果只允许说这面的看法不允许说那面的看法，只允许你放不允许我放，只许你批评共产党不许共产党批评你，就不能分清是非，客观地全面地分析问题，引起思想混乱。我们应当见到对就说对，见到不对就说不对，这叫老实，这叫忠诚，这才符合放鸣精神。否则，就不是充分的“放”和“鸣”。
    现在我本着争鸣精神提出两个问题：
    储安平的“党天下”的说法是抹煞事实。
    一、是不是“党天下”和“清一色”？储安平先生说：党群关系不好，关键在于共产党有“党天下”的思想，从而形成现在一家天下清一色的局面。我听了这话后，立刻联想到解放以前“蒋家天下陈家党”，这是当时人们痛恨反动政权所说的话。我们民革不少同志多年都曾为了反对蒋家天下诛除异己，为了要打倒那个党天下而艰苦斗争。可是，解放以后在人民民主的新中国里，还是一个党天下吗？是不是共产党又造成了清一色的局面？让事实来回答！
    在各级人民代表大会、政协、政府机关、企业、文教、新闻出版等各种机关里，都有大量的非党人士参加。刚解放时，毛主席就提出把留在大陆上的国民党政府的公务人员一起“包下来”的政策，至今各级政府中还有清朝、北洋和国民党政府三个时代的不少人物。我们各民主党派和无党派民主人士在共产党领导下都参加了政权，有共产党领导的多党联合政权，而无论在朝在野的区别，这是不是联合政府？这是“清一色”的局面吗？
    章伯钧的发言很容易被人理解为许多重大方针、政策没有经过政治协商和人大讨论。如果说许多重大事件都是共产党决定的，党外人士无从过问，这不符合事实。
    我还要联系到章伯钧先生的发言说几句话。章伯钧先生说：“今后有关国家的政策、方针性的重大问题，可以多听一听各方面的意见。……如果在工作进行之初，就多听听人大常委会、政协、民主党派的意见，就可以少走弯路。”“又如国家体制问题、中央地方的分权问题，去年只交地方党委书记和党外少数高级干部进行讨论。主要是党内讨论。应该利用政协、人大的各种委员会、民主党派去讨论……”又说“现在工业方面有许多设计院，可是政治上的许多设施就没有设计院。我看政协、人大、民主党派、人民团体，应该是政治上的设计院。”这样的看法，我个人不同意。像章伯钧先生的说法，很容易使人理解为：建国以来，许多重大方针、政策没有经过政治协商和人大讨论，而国家体制这样大事是民主党派无从过问的。
    我们有人大、人大常委会、政协，这些有的是权力机关，有的是协商机关，按宪法规定应该提到那里讨论的都提到那里讨论了。我们看，国家成立，共同通过了共同纲领，共同产生了政协。再看抗美援朝、镇反、土地改革、肃反等等大的运动，是不是没有经过协商，没有经过权力机关决定？镇反条例、土地改革法、婚姻法、兵役法、总路线、五年计划、国家预决算以及其他重大法律法令，是否没有经过协商，是否应该提到人大讨论的没有提到？谁能忘记我们的宪法草案是怎样经过广泛的全民的讨论，经过多少次的修改？这能说是一党包办吗？关于国家体制的问题，去年在北京、青岛和北戴河，讨论了多少天？多少人都参加了。所以如果说许多重大事件都是共产党决定的，党外人士无从过问，不符事实。我们应该说社会主义民主生活还需要扩大，非党人士的力量还需要充分发挥，可是如果认为过去许多国家重大体制问题没有事前和民主党派协商，以致造成许多大的错误，这符合事实吗？
    至于政治上的设计院我不明白。人大就是个权力机关，是否在这个权力机关内再来个权力机关？还是召集一些专家研究供参考，还是把几个权力、协商机关合起来另成一个机关？不大明确。我觉得有人大、人大常委会、政协，只要我们在其中多发挥力量，只要把政策提出来充分讨论，就可以扩大社会主义民主，更加发挥党外人士的作用。这次政协有四百多人次发言，还不够充分吗？根据以上情况，能不能说我们国家的重大决策以及计划、法令是共产党家天下包办的？
    这种古今中外没有见过的广泛的民主，是封建主义和资本主义统治下所能得到的民主吗？这是在“蒋家天下陈家党”底下的人所能得到的吗？
    去年中共提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，毛主席在讲人民内部矛盾问题时又提出了“统筹兼顾，适当安排，一切从六亿人出发”的方针，又说和非党人士长期合作是永远不变、固定不移的，在这样的方针政策下，能说是家天下，清一色吗？最近中共自动提出要求党外各方面帮助党整风，要求大放大鸣，形成了这回古今中外没有见到的广泛的民主，这是封建主义和资本主义统治所能想像得到的民主吗？这是在“蒋家天下陈家党”底下生活过的人所能梦想的吗？党群关系在某些地方不好，党员中有宗派主义，是事实，必须纠正。而且相信通过全国各方面提意见、帮助是可纠正的，所以要整风。可是如果因为党员中有宗派主义，就说共产党有党天下的思想，不合事实。储安平先生说：“这个‘党天下’的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源，是党和非党之间矛盾的基本所在。”可是从上面举出的人所共知的事实来看，怎么能证明共产党的政策方针是党天下的思想？共产党是国家领导核心，这是全国人民所一致拥护的。如果说共产党当了领导，就是党天下，那末是不是说取消了党的领导，才能消灭宗派主义？如果说只要有党存在就不能解决党与非党的矛盾，那末是不是只有解散一切政党？
    在各种各样的意见中，有一些意见显然是错误的。这类意见不应限制别人提，也不应限制别人反对。
    二、要不要共产党的领导，要不要社会主义？这次非党人士帮助党整风，应该说极大多数是出于爱国爱党，不但党员应该虚心听取、改正缺点，我相信也是全国人民所欢迎的。因为党和人民的利益是一致的，因为他们的目的是为了加强和巩固共产党的领导与更好的实现社会主义。可是在各种各样的意见中，有一些意见显然是错误的，有人想共产党退出这里放弃那里，有人提出要共产党退出学校，公私合营企业中要撤出公方代表，不要马列主义作指导思想，官僚主义比资本主义更危险等等。如果这样，是否要党的领导？要不要社会主义？这类意见已在学校、企业和社会上展开了热烈的讨论、争辩。真理愈辩愈明，不应该划框框。这类意见，不应限制别人提，也不应限制别人反对。
    王德周、葛佩琦的发言令人愤慨。
    不能不使人感到愤慨的是有人对党咬牙切齿，仿佛有什么深仇大恨。人民大学讲师王德周说：“现在党内有百分之九十几的党员闹宗派，甚至无恶不作。”又说：“闹事要架机枪，这是可以的，麻烦的是怕机关枪倒过来打。”葛佩琦说：“搞得好，可以；不好，群众可以打倒你们，杀共产党人，推翻你们，这不能说不爱国，因为共产党人不为人民服务。共产党亡了，中国也不会亡。……”
      同志们！请听一听这是什么人的愿望，什么人的声音？说“共产党员百分之九十几无恶不作”，是的，他们所作的是反对帝国主义的“恶”，消灭地主阶级的“恶”，肃清反革命分子的“恶”！的确，共产党有些事比国民党更“坏”，“坏”在要反对美帝国主义，“坏”在要消灭剥削，“坏”在要解放台湾，“坏”在把中国的钢的生产量从九十万吨提高到四百五十万吨，“坏”在要把中国建设成一个社会主义国家。可是，共产党这些“恶”，正是人民心目中的善，这些“坏”正是人民心目中的好。如果有人想起来杀共产党，决用不着架机关枪，老百姓就会拿起他们的锄头、铁锤来的。
    谁是诚心诚意帮助共产党整风，谁是混淆是非、颠倒黑白，广大人民是能够分辨的。
    先生们，清醒一点吧！反对社会主义中国，妄想共产党垮台是那些心怀阶级仇恨的人，是美帝国主义。请你们用眼睛看一看国家建设事业的伟大成就，用耳朵听一听广大人民爱国爱党的声音。
    全国广大人民、各民主党派、一切爱国的知识分子眼睛是雪亮的，谁是诚心诚意帮助共产党整风，扫除“三害”，谁是混淆是非，颠倒黑白，是能够分辨的。整风是共产党的要求，帮助整风是民主党派的责任，而我们过去同共产党共过患难，现在和共产党休戚相关，我们应该本着爱党的精神，坚持“放”“鸣”，“知无不言，言无不尽”，看到中共的缺点，还要继续提出批评，这才对得起朋友，尽了我们的力量。
  吴茂荪说：我们应该支持卢郁文。有人用匿名信恐吓他，显然是想钻空子，破坏整风运动。
    吴茂荪在发言中说，我们大家都看到了今天的人民日报社论，卢郁文的发言是在民革中央小组发的，而他因此就得到了匿名恐吓信，对这个问题，我也想在民革中央小组上拿出来谈一谈。
    卢郁文那样说，可以不同意，但不能不准他说，更不能硬说他是说假话，否则那就是主观主义。
    卢郁文稍为一点正面的话，就用写匿名信的卑鄙手段，说他是“无耻之尤”“为虎作伥”，不能不引起人们的愤慨和抗议。
    卢郁文提出的有职有权问题，我觉得他的分析有一定道理，不能一笔抹煞。他说他和党员处得较好，当然也是可能的，为什么只能是假的不能是真的，这样说太不能服人了。
    关于有职无权问题，我认为和墙沟问题一样，是来自两方面的。一方面是某些党员有宗派主义情绪或知识水平低，另一方面从我们党外人士来看，在工作作风上、思想水平和业务水平上也有许多值得检查改进的地方。我们一方面要帮助共产党克服宗派主义的缺点，另方面我们也要努力提高自己。惟有这样，才能真正解决有职有权的问题。目前的情况是，有职无权问题是比较普遍而严重地存在；但是党与非党合作共事较好的情况也是同样地存在的。我们不能否定一切。
    我认为，不能把卢郁文的话一笔抹煞，不能说他说的话阻碍了“鸣放”。当然，他的意见还是可以讨论的。有人写匿名信恐吓他，显然是想钻空子、破坏整风运动。我们也应该支持他。
    在会上发言的还有：许宝驹、陈劭先、覃异之、刘斐。
    朱学范说：“放”和“鸣”的前提是巩固党的领导，不能容许资本主义思想对社会主义思想进攻。如果要进攻，我们要反攻。
    朱学范说，“放”和“鸣”的前提是巩固党的领导，是使社会主义事业得到更大的成就，这也是民主党派非党人士的愿望。大家敢于提意见，这气氛很好，都是从热爱党出发，应该发挥它培养它。既是大放大鸣，就既可以批评，也可以反批评，这才能找出真理，明辨是非。
    朱学范说，最近看到报纸上有些文章和发言，我有些怀疑，怀疑他们是不是从巩固党的领导、把社会主义建设得更好的愿望出发。他说，像中国人民大学讲师葛佩琦和王德周的发言，是颠倒黑白，虚构事实。葛佩琦曾说“今天老百姓对共产党是‘敬鬼神而远之’”，不知道他指的“老百姓”究竟是谁，葛佩琦为什么不到工人和农民中去看看。朱学范说，他不相信今天中国的工人、农民、青年学生、知识分子以及民族资本家对共产党是“敬鬼神而远之”的。他同时指出，王德周说有百分之九十几的党员无恶不作，也是没有根据的。我们和中共合作了这么久，看到共产党有缺点也有错误，有许多事可以办得更好，却办坏了。可是，如果抹煞了一切事实，这是公道的吗？我认为是不公道的。看起来这几位先生似乎要把党领导人民所得到的成绩都要打垮。
    朱学范说：葛佩琦说不要中国共产党，人家也不会卖国。可是大家都不会忘记，历史上前清、北洋军阀、袁世凯、蒋介石那一个不卖国？要是忘记了的话，也可以看一下今天台湾的情况，我是根本不同意这种说法的。他说，像葛佩琦这样的言论，可能是一时的冲动。因为不能相信，高级知识分子会发表这样的言论。
    朱学范认为民主党派的同志们有责任纠正这些错误观点。他引用了毛主席的话：一切离开社会主义的言论和行动都是错误的。
    朱学范说，在这次大放大鸣中，似乎有两种不同思想的斗争：资本主义思想和社会主义思想。对有些观点要指出它是属于那方面的，不要混淆视听。不能容许资本主义思想对社会主义思想进攻，如果要进攻，我们要反攻，我们今天的国家社会主义思想是主导思想，社会主义道路是肯定的道路。不要忘记宪法的第一条：中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。任何离开这一条的言论行动，我是要反对的，大家也一样会反对。
    朱学范说，解放后，在党的领导下，在六亿人民的国家进行社会主义建设的伟大事业，进行轰轰烈烈的社会改革，经验不够，很多事情都是创造性的，谁也不能保证不犯错误。党发觉了，自己要整风，这是多么大的喜事！大家要勇于发言，诚诚恳恳地把什么意见都端出来。以后也不能保证不再犯错误，所以“放”“鸣”要继续下去，有错误就提，有缺点就提，就可以使我们少犯错误，有错误也可以及早改正。
    政权是党领导的，但是党、政要有明确分工。
    朱学范最后就以党代政问题、对旧人员看法问题以及法制问题，对党提出了批评。他说，政权是党领导的，但是党、政应有明确分工。党的政策要通过政府机关制成决议、命令、指示去贯彻执行。过去在这方面没有经验。他以对报纸发行问题的决定为例，邮电部党组就这个问题给党中央做了报告，中央作了决定下达到各地党委，再由党委告诉邮电部门中的党员，这就脱离了行政系统，削弱了行政系统力量。他希望在这次整风中对党政分工问题加以研究。朱学范提出对旧人员要估计到他们进步的一面。他们过去在国民党政权中服务大多是为了生活。过去看他们落后方面多，看进步方面少。许多地方的墙和沟就发生在对他们的看法上。但是，八年来他们都有进步。现在是对他们重做估计，打破隔阂的时候了。他还对机关干部退职退休龄的计算办法提出了建议。最后，他对法制提了意见。
    李俊龙说：那种写匿名恐吓信的行为，是一种极不光明的卑鄙行为，有不同意见的人，应该光明正大地站出来讲话。
    一、帮助中共整风，是为了整掉有些共产党员在工作中存在的三种歪风，从而更加巩固中国共产党在六亿人民中间的领导，决不是为了削弱中共的领导，更不是要脱离中共的领导。因为接受中国共产党的领导是全国人民同意的，也是历史证明了符合于全国人民的最高利益的。
    二、帮助中共整风，是为了整掉妨碍社会主义事业前进的三种歪风，更有利于社会主义事业的前进，决不是要脱离社会主义道路。因为社会主义道路是全国人民选择的道路，离开了这条道路就是离开了革命的道路。
    三、但是，应该区别：对中共提批评意见，只要是善意的，实事求是的，忠诚老实的，就应该认为是真正爱护共产党的好朋友，不能错误地当作是反对共产党。同样，如果明知有的共产党员在工作中存在着若干错误和缺点也不肯说，而只一味说些好听的话，那就不是真正爱护共产党的正派人所应采取的态度。因为中国共产党是对国家负主要责任的，我们与共产党是休戚相关“生死与共”的，我们应该忠诚老实，知无不言，言无不尽。帮助共产党就是帮助我们自己。
    四、民主是要有容忍不同意见的风度的，社会主义民主是必须接受工人阶级领导的。在帮助中共进行整风的过程中，既要允许对共产党提批评的意见，也要允许对批评者提反批评的意见，真理愈辩愈明，共产党不怕批评，合乎事实的批评者也不应该害怕反批评。我们今天的方针，是毛主席提出的“百花齐放”“百家争鸣”的方针，而不是“一花独放”“一家独鸣”。我们应该学会倾听不同的意见。至于那种写匿名恐吓信的人，是一种极不光明的卑鄙行为，我们同意人民日报对这种人的严正指责。有不同意见的人，应该光明正大地站出来讲话。
    五、我们应该继续坚持“放”与“鸣”的方针，应该保护这种广开言路的风气。使所有的人把心里要讲的话都讲出来，并且要把这些意见变为积极性的建议，使得经过整风，更加巩固中国共产党在全国人民中的领导，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，使我国伟大的社会主义事业更能顺利地推向前进。
