The Party organization of the Central Institute for Nationalities Listens to Professors' Opinions During Rectification

(Our Dispatch) Since the beginning of the rectification campaign at the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Party committee has invited professors to many forums. At these forums, the professors raised many criticisms regarding the shortcomings and errors existing in the school.

Wu Wenzao said that the "professors managing the school" system is not suitable for today's environment.

Professor Wu Wenzao said that professors participating in running the school is acceptable, but the system of "professors managing the school" is not suitable for today's environment. I think the policy of "democratic school management" proposed at the Party Congress of our institute is more appropriate. He said that the distinction between Party and administration in our institute is not clear enough. The Party should not replace the administration. The Party's policies should be implemented through the administration and embodied by the Party member president. He said that the school affairs committee system can be considered in our school, which is a correct direction for the development of universities.

Wen You said that today, while treating others, we must also treat ourselves.

Professor Wen You said that some people may be afraid of demolishing walls and therefore adopt the attitude of "a wise man does not stand under a dangerous wall." The wall must be demolished. Even if one or two fingers are injured in the process of demolishing the wall, it doesn't matter. Not long ago, I met an old friend who said to me: since liberation, we have always been patients in every movement, and this time we are going to be doctors. I think his statement is not comprehensive enough. We have our own responsibilities as doctors, but we ourselves are still sick. So today, while treating others, we must also treat ourselves. Currently, we are practicing medicine while sick.

Professor Fu Donghuan said that "professors managing the school" is not suitable for the Central Institute for Nationalities. The leadership work of our institute is closely related to the work of nationalities, which is beneficial to the development of our institute's work. It is impossible and unimaginable for the Party to withdraw from the school. The school affairs committee system is a form, but the leadership of the Party is also indispensable.

Lin Yaohua said, let us work together to tear down the walls.

Professor Lin Yaohua said that it is necessary for the Central Institute for Nationalities to run preparatory courses, but the work of division of labor and management should be done well, and a dean should be designated to lead the preparatory courses specifically. At the same time, departments such as the Academic Affairs Office and other departments can also divide the work. This can take care of both the preparatory courses and other departments, and the teaching affairs with different characteristics cannot be confused. He said that there is little contact between Party members and intellectuals. Some Party members think that intellectuals are complicated and difficult to deal with; some intellectuals are afraid of Party members, saying that Party members are cold and not easy to approach. In fact, these opinions are caused by mutual incomprehension and lack of communication. Now, to demolish the walls, both sides need to work together to tear them down.

Wang Jingru said that Communist Party members should be selfless, not necessarily sternly impartial.

Wang Jingru said that the wall is being hit from both sides. However, the wall also needs to be built by the builders. There are all kinds of wall builders. Some Communist Party members say that they are sternly impartial. In my opinion, Communist Party members should be selfless, why be sternly impartial? Some people put on a stern face immediately after becoming a Party member. There are so many non-Party members in China, what good is it to put on a stern face? As a result, people don't talk to him. One leading comrade got off his bicycle to greet me every time he saw me. I was touched and gave him advice, saying that you can go down and understand the situation among the students. Why was I able to give him advice? That's what he got in exchange for getting off his bicycle.

### 中央民族学院党组织  在整风中听取教授意见

    中央民族学院党组织
    在整风中听取教授意见
    本报讯　中央民族学院整风开始以后，党委会曾邀请教授举行过许多次座谈会。在座谈会上，教授们对学校里存在的缺点和错误提出了许多批评。
    吴文藻说，教授治校与今天时代环境不适合
    吴文藻教授说，教授参加办校是可以的，但“教授治校”与今天时代环境不适合。我认为我院党代表大会上提出“民主办学”的方针比较合适。他说，我院党政区分不大清楚，党不应代替行政，党的方针应通过行政来贯彻实现，由党员院长来体现。他说，校务委员会制在我们学校里是可以考虑的，这是高等学校发展的一个正确的方向。
    闻宥说，今天在替人治病的当中，同时还要替自己治病
    闻宥教授说，有的人可能怕拆墙，因而采取“知命者不立于危墙之下”的态度。墙必须拆除，为了拆墙，即使碰伤了一两个手指头，也不在乎。不久以前，我遇到一位老朋友，他对我说：自从解放以来，每次运动我们总是当病人，这回我们要当医生了。我觉得他这句话也不够全面，当医生我们自有责任，但是，我们自身还是有病的。所以今天在替人治病的当中，同时还要替自己治病，目前我们是带病行医。
    傅东焕教授说，“教授治校”在中央民族学院是不合适的。我院领导工作都是与民族工作有密切联系的，对我院的工作开展是有好处的。如果党退出学校是不可能的，也是不可想像的。校务委员会制是一种形式，但党的领导也是不可缺少的。
    林耀华说，共同努力拆墙
    林耀华教授说，中央民族学院办预科是必要的，但应该做好分工管理工作，指定一个院长专门领导预科，同时，像教务处和其他一些部门也可以分工。这样既可以照顾预科，又可以照顾其他系科，不能同不同特点的教务工作混同起来。他说，党员和知识分子往来很少，有些党员认为知识分子复杂，难办事；有些知识分子怕党员，说党员冷冰冰的，不容易接近。实际上这些意见，都是因为互不了解，互不交往而产生的，现在要拆墙，需要双方共同努力才能拆倒。
    王静如说，共产党员要大公无私，不必铁面无私
    王静如说，墙是两面打的。但是，拆墙还需砌墙人。各种各样砌墙的人都有。有的共产党员说，他是铁面无私的。我看，共产党员应该是大公无私的，何必铁面无私？有人做了党员之后，立刻摆上了一副面孔。全中国非党员那么多，摆上一副铁面有什么好处呢？结果人不同他谈话了。有一个领导同志，见我就下自行车，下了多少次。我感动了，就向他提意见说，你可以下去了解了解学生中的情况。为什么我能对他提意见呢？这就是他下自行车换来的。
