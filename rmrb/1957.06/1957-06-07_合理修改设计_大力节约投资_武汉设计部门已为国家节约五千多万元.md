This Newspaper Wuhan Dispatch, 6th of the Month: This year, Wuhan's various design departments have more widely carried out the work of "comprehensively inspecting projects, rationally modifying designs, and vigorously saving investment." Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, they have saved the country more than 50 million yuan in investment.

Appropriately lowering the overly high standards of the original design, striving to reduce some unnecessary luxury facilities, phasing and delaying the construction of certain building projects that can be postponed, and some mechanical equipment that is currently temporarily unnecessary, fully utilizing old equipment and using substitute materials, these are the main principles of Wuhan's design departments in modifying designs and saving investment this year. The cast iron machine on the blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was originally designed to be imported, with a price of 950,000 yuan per set. The ironmaking engineers of the Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute improved the domestic cast iron machine and used it to replace the imported one. According to calculations, two cast iron machines alone saved more than one million yuan. The Hubei Paper Mill originally planned to build an attached power plant. After research by the designers of the Wuhan Power Design Institute, it was believed that the electricity of the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant could be utilized. They suggested that the paper mill only install a few low-pressure boilers to solve the steam needed for production in the factory, and that it was not necessary to build a separate attached power plant, which would save an investment of 3.4 million yuan. In addition, the Fourth Railway Design Institute and the Highway Design Institute modified some detour lines, appropriately reduced the slope of some roadbeds, changed the structure of some bridges and culverts, and considered sourcing materials nearby for construction, all of which saved a lot of investment.

In the process of modifying the designs, the designers paid close attention to providing full argumentation and conducting economic comparisons. Some design departments also adopted the form of a "round table conference," where design, construction, and construction jointly consulted, so that the modified design was satisfactory to each other. Recently, the Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute modified the design of the expansion projects of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Daye Steel Plant, organizing professional engineers and technicians in charge of specific work to discuss together, and determined it after heated debate.

    合理修改设计　大力节约投资
    武汉设计部门已为国家节约五千多万元
    本报武汉6日电　今年，武汉各设计部门较普遍地进行了“全面检查工程，合理修改设计，大力节约投资”的工作。到目前为止，据不完全的统计，为国家节约了投资五千多万元。
    适当降低原设计的过高标准，尽量削减一些不必要的豪华设施，分期缓建某些能够推迟的建筑工程和目前暂时可以不要的机械设备，充分利用旧有设备和使用代用材料，这是武汉各设计部门今年修改设计、节约投资的几个主要原则。武钢工程高炉上的铸铁机，原来设计是用国外的，每套价格九十五万元，黑色冶金设计院武汉分院的炼铁工程师把国内的铸铁机加以改进，用国内的代替国外的，据计算，两台铸铁机就省下了一百多万元。湖北造纸厂原来计划兴建一座附属发电厂，经武汉电力设计院设计师们研究，认为可以利用武汉热电厂的电力。他们建议造纸厂只安装几个低压锅炉来解决厂内生产需要的热气，不必要另外单独兴建一座附属发电厂，这样就节省了三百四十万元的投资。另外，铁道第四设计院和公路设计院修改了一些迂回线路，适当降低了某些路基的坡度，改变了一些桥、涵的结构，并考虑了施工的就近取材，都节约了不少投资。
    设计师们在修改设计的过程中，密切注意了提出充分论证和进行经济比较。有的设计部门还采用了“圆桌会议”的形式，由设计、兴建、施工三方面共同磋商，因而修改后的设计，彼此满意。最近，黑色冶金设计院武汉分院修改马鞍山铁厂、大冶钢厂扩建工程设计，就是组织了各专业工程师和担负具体工作的技术员们一道研讨，经过了热烈的争辩，然后确定下来的。
