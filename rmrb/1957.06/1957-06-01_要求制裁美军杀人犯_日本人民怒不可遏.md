Demanding Punishment for American Soldier Murderer
Japanese People Are Furious
    This newspaper's comprehensive report: The unprovoked killing of Japanese farmer Sakaicho by American soldier Jerard on January 30 this year has aroused great anger among the Japanese people, and a movement demanding that the Japanese government try this murderer is spreading widely throughout Japan.
    On January 30, after the U.S. Army's Eighth Cavalry Regiment held a shooting exercise at the Somagahara training ground in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, several farmers entered the training ground to collect shell casings. An American soldier named Jerard lured the farmers to approach him with shell casings, and then suddenly raised his gun and shot at them, the first shot wounding a young farmer in the foot. The second shot killed a farmer named Sakaicho. This farmer was 46 years old and a mother of six children.
    The incident of the American soldier shooting and killing a Japanese farmer immediately aroused the indignation of the Japanese people. Japanese newspapers reported the incident in great detail. In the past, the Japanese press rarely reported on the countless incidents caused by American soldiers' atrocities, and the victims had nowhere to appeal. According to Kyodo News, more than 150 Japanese people have been shot and killed or wounded by American soldiers while picking up shell casings at U.S. military training grounds throughout Japan, including 29 who have been shot and killed at the Somagahara training ground.
    The Japan Socialist Party conducted an on-site investigation of the Somagahara incident. Since February 4, Socialist Party members have been constantly questioning the government in the Diet, demanding that the Japanese government impose legal sanctions on the American murderer. On February 9, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan also sent an investigation team to the site, believing that this "unfortunate incident" was "the result of the U.S. military's disrespect for people's lives and human rights." The Cabinet Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives also demanded that the American murderer be punished quickly and independently. The Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office of Japan determined that American soldier Jerard had committed the crime of "causing death by injury outside of duty." However, the American side believes that this was an incident that occurred while on duty, and according to the "Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement," the Japanese side has no jurisdiction.
    On February 20, the Japan National Conference Against Military Bases held a National Rally to Protest the Shooting of a Japanese Woman by an American Soldier. The rally was attended by representatives of farmers from Somagahara in Gunma Prefecture, as well as representatives from labor unions, schools, cultural circles, women's circles, and political circles, totaling about two thousand people. The conference unanimously resolved to lodge a serious protest with the President of the United States and the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, demanding that the American soldier murderer be handed over to Japan for trial. The conference also passed a declaration calling on the Japanese people to fight for the abolition of unequal treaties and the realization of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan.
    Under the angry protests of the Japanese people, on May 16, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee met, and the U.S. Forces Far East Command was forced to agree to hand over the criminal to Japan for trial. However, a day later, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson suddenly ordered the U.S. military authorities in the Far East not to hand Jerard over to the Japanese government. When this news reached Japan, it aroused strong opposition from various people's organizations and political parties in Japan. The Socialist Party and Sōhyō (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) sent representatives to the U.S. Embassy on the 27th, demanding that Jerard be handed over to the Japanese government for trial. Japanese Acting Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii also said on the 26th that, regardless of any opposition within the United States, Japan definitely has jurisdiction over the case of American soldier Jerard shooting and killing a Japanese farmer.
    Currently, the movement demanding punishment for the American soldier murderer is spreading widely throughout the country. On May 28, representatives of the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and labor unions and farmers' groups held a joint meeting in Somagahara, deciding to launch a national movement starting in June demanding that the American murderer Jerard be tried by Japan. The Maebashi District Court, which is responsible for trying the American murderer Jerard, has decided to prepare for the first public trial at the end of June. (Attached picture)

### 要求制裁美军杀人犯  日本人民怒不可遏

    要求制裁美军杀人犯
    日本人民怒不可遏
    本报综合报道　今年1月30日美兵哲腊德无故杀死了日本农妇坂井中，引起了日本人民极大的愤怒，要求日本政府审判这个杀人凶手的运动正在日本各地广泛展开。
    1月30日，美军第八骑兵联队在日本群马县相马原演习场举行了射击演习以后，好几个农民进入了演习场拾取弹壳。一个叫哲腊德的美国兵以子弹壳引诱农民走到他的跟前，突然举枪对准他们射击，第一枪打伤了一个青年农民的脚。第二枪打死了一个叫坂井中的农妇。这个农妇今年四十六岁，是六个孩子的母亲。
    美兵枪杀日本农妇事件，立即引起了日本人民的愤慨。日本报纸用大量的篇幅报道这一事件。在过去，因美军暴行所引起的无数事件，日本新闻界一向很少报道，受害者有冤无处申诉。据共同社报道，在日本各地美军演习场因拾弹壳而被美军打死打伤的日本人，已有一百五十多人，其中在相马原演习场被打死的就有二十九人。
    日本社会党对这次相马原事件进行了现场调查。从2月4日以来，社会党议员不断在国会上提出质询，要求日本政府给美国凶手以法律制裁。2月9日日本执政党自由民主党也派出一个调查团到现场调查，认为这种“不祥事件”是“美军不尊重人民的生命和人权的结果”。日本众议院内阁委员会也要求迅速地自主地惩办这个美国杀人凶犯。日本最高检察厅确定美兵哲腊德犯了“在非执行公务时间内伤人致死罪”。但是，美国方面却认为这是在执行公务中发生的事件，按照“日美行政协定”的规定，日本方面没有裁判权。
    2月20日，日本全国反对军事基地会议举行抗议美国兵枪杀日本妇女国民大会。参加大会的有从群马县相马原赶来的农民代表，工会、学校、文化界、妇女界和政界的代表共约二千人。大会一致决议向美国总统和远东美军总司令提出严重抗议，要求把美军杀人凶手交给日本审判。大会还通过一项宣言，呼吁日本人民为废除不平等条约和实现美军从日本撤退而斗争。
    在日本人民愤怒抗议之下，5月16日，日美联合委员会开会，远东美军司令部才被迫同意将凶犯交给日本审判。但是过了一天，美国国防部部长威尔逊突然命令远东美军当局不要把哲腊德交给日本政府。这个消息传到日本后，更引起了日本各人民团体和政党的强烈反对。社会党和“总评”在27日派代表到美国大使馆，要求把哲腊德交给日本政府审判。日本代理首相石井光次郎在26日也说，不管在美国内部有怎样的反对，日本对美国兵哲腊德枪杀日本农妇案件肯定地具有审判权。
    目前，日本人民要求制裁美军杀人犯的运动正在全国各地广泛开展。5月28日，日本社会党、共产党以及工会、农民团体的代表在相马原举行联席会议，决定从6月份开始展开一个要求由日本审判美国杀人凶手哲腊德的国民运动。担当审判美国杀人凶手哲腊德的前桥地方裁判所已经决定，准备在6月末举行第一次公审。（附图片）
