    Don't Forget Your Roots!
    Once, our theater troupe went to a small town in northern Jiangsu for a performance. As soon as we arrived, the cadres were busy arranging accommodation for the actors. There weren't enough dormitory rooms, and the cadres were trying their best to find a solution, but one actor threw a tantrum, saying that the cadres didn't care about the actors' lives. The cadres explained to him, but he shouted even louder, with such ferocity that it seemed like he was ready to fight someone.
    Before liberation, the suffering of us artists was endless! We ate bran and coarse grains, wore tattered clothes, and drifted aimlessly year after year. Abandoned gardens and broken temples were the artists' dormitories! At that time, we Sizhou opera artists had two sayings: "Head resting on a gray brick, body covered with reed mats, wherever we die, we are buried." Many artists died naked in sheds, meadows, and broken temples, buried with only two bundles of reeds and three straw ropes. As for social status, it goes without saying.
    Now, everything is better for us, but some people forget the pain once the wound heals. They throw tantrums over minor dissatisfactions in life. Isn't this forgetting our roots?
  (Yuan Yuqing, Actor of Bengbu Sizhou Opera Troupe)

    不能忘本呀！
    有一次我们剧团到苏北一个小城镇里演出。一到那里，干部就忙着给演员们安排住的地方。那里宿舍不够住，干部正在尽力想办法，但有个演员却大发脾气，说干部不关心演员生活。干部们给他解释，他更吵得凶，当时那股凶劲，好像就要和谁拼了似的。
    解放前我们艺人的苦是说不完的！吃的是糠菜杂粮，穿的是破衣烂衫，常年漂泊无定，荒园破庙就是艺人的宿舍！那时我们泗州戏艺人口中有两句话：“头枕灰砖铺芦柴，哪里死了哪里埋。”很多艺人赤身露体的死在车屋、草园和破庙里，只用两捆芦柴三条草绳就葬埋了。至于社会地位，那就更不用说了。
    现在，我们什么都好了，有人却好了伤疤忘了疼，生活上稍有不满就大发雷霆，这不是忘本吗？
  （蚌埠市泗州戏剧团演员  袁玉清）
