Peking University and Renmin University Teachers' Symposiums
Resolutely Draw a Line Between Ourselves and Rightist Elements

　　(Our Newspaper) This morning, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committee Secretary and Vice-President of Peking University, Jiang Longji, invited more than thirty professors and lecturers to a symposium yesterday afternoon. Everyone criticized some of the anti-socialist remarks that have appeared both inside and outside the university during the current rectification movement.
　　Professor Zhu Guangqian said that during the current rectification movement, some people have made anti-socialist remarks. These erroneous remarks have already had a very bad impact. We must distinguish between right and wrong so that the rectification movement can develop in a healthy direction.
　　Professor Shao Xunzheng said that while we are carrying out rectification in our school, some erroneous remarks have appeared. Outside our school, there have also been erroneous remarks such as those of Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping. These remarks should be criticized in order to distinguish right from wrong. I think Fei Xiaotong's attitude towards absurd remarks is very wrong. He only said that mistakes should be recognized, but on the other hand, he also said that such remarks are inevitable in the movement. These words also show his own attitude. As for some of the erroneous remarks that have appeared in our school, I think they should also be criticized.
　　Professor Wen Jiashi said, I think that if the People's Daily does not publish an editorial to counter-criticize some of the anti-socialist remarks that have appeared nationwide, then the newspaper itself has lost its position. I think the People's Daily editorial is good. For those who make destructive remarks, I really want to ask them what position they are taking to speak. The Party wants us to help the Party make suggestions in the rectification, and we must stand firm, be vigilant, and counter-criticize this kind of destructive remarks that are hostile to socialism.
　　Professor Rui Mu said: If anti-socialist remarks that have appeared recently are not promptly refuted, so that people can recognize the harm of such remarks, it will cause chaos and confusion between right and wrong. Rui Mu said that non-Party members should not only continue to make suggestions to the Party in the future, but also have the responsibility to actively help the Party distinguish between right and wrong, and refute anti-socialist remarks. We must rectify and distinguish between right and wrong at the same time. He said: Mr. Fei Xiaotong's attitude is still not very clear. He said he was "both happy and worried," but I really don't know what he is worried about.
　　Professor Wang Tieya said that Ge Peiqi's saying that the Communist Party is finished, China will not be finished, Chu Anping's organization of a coalition government, Zhang Bojun's establishment of a political design institute, and the so-called "Declaration of Liberals" at Peking University should all be criticized. This is not a question of eliminating three pests, this is a question of opposing the leadership of the Communist Party and opposing socialism.
　　Professor Gong Xiangrui said that everyone likes to talk about capitalist democracy. People who have studied at British and American universities can compare: In those countries, are there such democratic and free conditions as we have? Can students make such sharp criticisms of principals and teachers? He said: The current need to counter anti-socialist remarks is to help rectification. If this is not done, the masses' consciousness and enthusiasm to help the Party rectify will be frustrated.
　　During the symposium, professors Shen Youzhen, Li Jidong, Xing Qiyi, Huang Kun, Zhang Qinglian and others all unanimously pointed out that some of the anti-socialist remarks that have appeared in the school should be criticized, ideological and political education for students should be strengthened, and a good academic style and discipline should be established, so that the school's rectification movement can develop in the correct direction.
　　The symposium will continue on the afternoon of the 13th.
　　Also, the CCP Committee of Renmin University of China continued to invite teachers to a symposium. At the meeting, many people refuted the erroneous remarks of teachers Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou in the school.
　　Wang Tongzu said that Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou's anti-Party and anti-socialist arguments have aroused the dissatisfaction of workers and farmers, and intellectuals should at least regard them as "black sheep." Although Ge Peiqi has repeatedly explained his arguments, his erroneous arguments are very obvious.
　　In his speech, Wu Jingchao, in addition to analyzing the thoughts of Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou, also refuted Ge Peiqi's erroneous remarks with his own experience. He said that I have had many opportunities to contact workers and farmers in the past few years. They love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. They believe that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no good life now, and there would be no better future. If anyone wants to overthrow the Communist Party, the workers and peasants will pick up hammers and hoes and fight him desperately.
　　Pang Jingren said that since the beginning of the rectification movement, the vast majority of non-Party intellectuals have put forward opinions and criticisms to the Party in the spirit of loving the Party and the people. Even if some individuals' attitudes are a bit impulsive, they have not departed from the spirit of unity-criticism-unity. Only a few people are taking advantage of the rectification opportunity to openly make wild remarks, stir up trouble, and attempt to oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose socialism. Where intellectuals should put their positions is a serious test today. The reactionary fallacies of Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou must be refuted. Doing so does not lose the spirit of unity, nor will it affect "great blooming" and "great contending." Because unity is unity on a certain basis, and this basis is the firm belief in socialism. Those who hate the socialist system, they believe that more than 90% of the Communists are "doing all kinds of evil," so they want to "overthrow the Communist Party and kill the Communists," and believe that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should not kill counter-revolutionaries, "killers must die, and they must die even if they kill one person"; They believe that now is not the time to help the Party rectify, but "the time for the owner to settle accounts with the manager." Is it possible for such people to have a common position with us? I think only by clarifying this point will "blooming" and "contending" not lose direction, and will develop more healthily and vigorously.
　　In his speech, Wu Dakun first criticized the dogmatism and sectarianism of Renmin University. Then he talked about that some remarks against the Party and the socialist road should be resolutely refuted. He said that this is to draw ideological boundaries, so that the rectification movement can be carried out more healthily, and "blooming" and "contending" can be better. He said that some people's remarks have deviated from the socialist principle. I have no personal opinions with Zhang Naiqi, but I disagree with his remarks. He said that Zhang Naiqi said that the bourgeoisie has two sides, and the working class also has two sides; that there is a difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, but there is no difference between workers and capitalists; and that fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income, etc. I think these words blur the class position. My dispute with Zhang Naiqi is not a theoretical dispute, but a dispute between two roads.
　　Yang Chengzuo, Liu Yixuan, Xu Mengxiong, and Li Jinghan also spoke at the meeting.

　　北京大学和中国人民大学教师座谈
　　坚决同右派分子划清界限
    本报讯  中共北京大学党委书记、北京大学副校长江隆基在昨日下午邀请了三十多位教授、讲师举行座谈会。大家对目前整风运动中校内外出现的一些反社会主义的言论作了批判。
    朱光潜教授说，目前整风运动中，有一些人发表了反社会主义的言论。这些错误言论，已经发生了很不好的影响。我们必须明辨是非，使整风运动向健康方向发展。
    邵循正教授说，我们学校里一边搞整风，一边出现了一些错误的言论。在我们学校以外，也出现了如葛佩琦、储安平的错误言论。对这些言论要加以批判，才能明辨是非。我认为费孝通对待荒谬言论的态度是非常错误的。他只说应该认识错误，但另一方面又说这样的言论也是运动中难免的。这些话也说明了他自己抱着什么态度。至于我们学校中出现的一些错误言论，我认为也是应该加以批判的。
    闻家驷教授说，我认为对目前全国范围内所出现的一些反社会主义的言论，如果人民日报不发表社论来反批评，那报纸本身就失去了立场。我认为人民日报的社论讲的好。对于这些发表破坏性的言论的人，我真要问他们是站在什么立场上来讲话。党要我们在整风中帮助党提意见，我们就要站稳立场，提高警惕，对这种仇视社会主义的破坏性言论一定要进行反批评。
    芮沐教授说：对于目前出现的反社会主义言论，如不及时加以驳斥，使人们认识这种言论的危害性，那就会造成混乱，是非不分。芮沐说，今后党外人士不仅应当继续向党提意见，而且有责任积极帮助党明辨是非，向反社会主义的言论进行驳斥。我们必须边整风，边明辨是非。他说：费孝通先生的态度到现在还是不太清楚的。他说他“一则以喜，一则以忧”，真不知道他忧的是什么。
    王铁崖教授说，葛佩琦的共产党亡了，中国也不会亡，储安平的组织联合政府，章伯钧的设立政治设计院，等等说法，北京大学里的所谓“自由主义者宣言”，都应该批驳。这不是除三害的问题，这是反对共产党领导，反对社会主义的问题。
    龚祥瑞教授说，大家喜欢谈资本主义民主，在英美大学读过书的人可以对比一下：在那些国家里，有没有如我们这样民主自由的条件？学生能不能对校长、教师提出这样尖锐的批评？他说：目前要回击反社会主义言论，就是为了要帮助整风。如果不这样做，群众帮助党整风的自觉性、积极性是会受到挫折的。
    座谈中，申又桭、李继侗、邢其毅、黄昆、张青莲等教授都一致指出，对目前学校中出现的一些反对社会主义的言论应该加以批判，加强对学生的思想政治教育，树立良好的学风和纪律，使学校的整风运动向正确方向开展。
    座谈会将在13日下午继续举行。
    又讯  中共中国人民大学委员会继续邀请教师座谈。会上，许多人对学校内教师葛佩琦、王德周的错误言论进行了驳斥。
    汪同祖说，葛佩琦、王德周的反党、反社会主义的论调，引起工人、农民的不满，知识分子至少要把他们看作“害群之马”。尽管葛佩琦一再就他的论点作解释，但是他的错误论调是很明显的。
    吴景超在发言中除了对于葛佩琦、王德周的思想进行分析以外，并且以自身的经历反驳了葛佩琦的错误言论。他说，我这几年有许多机会与工人、农民接触，他们爱戴毛主席和共产党，认为没有共产党的领导，就不可能有现在美好的生活，也不可能有更美好的将来。如果有人想推翻共产党，工农群众就会拿起铁锤、锄头来与他拚命。
    庞景仁说，整风运动开始以来，党外知识分子绝大多数本着爱党、爱人民的精神，向党提出了意见，展开了批评。个别人的态度即使有些冲动，但也没有离开团结——批评——团结的精神。只有少数人是借着整风机会，来公开地大放厥辞，兴风作浪，企图反对党的领导，反对社会主义。知识分子要把立场放在那里，今天正是一个严重考验的机会。对于葛佩琦、王德周的反动谬论必须予以驳斥，这样做并不失团结的精神，也不会影响“大鸣”“大放”。因为团结是在一定基础上的团结，这个基础就是对于社会主义的坚强信念。那些仇恨社会主义制度的人，他们认为90％以上的共产党员都是“无恶不作”，因而要“推翻共产党、杀共产党人”，认为肃反不该杀反革命分子，“杀人者死，杀一人也要他死”；认为现在不应是帮助党整风，而是“东家向经理算账的时候了”。难道像这样的人会和我们有什么共同的立场？我认为只有把这一点搞清楚，“放”、“鸣”才不会迷失方向，才会更健康、更有力地开展起来。
    吴大琨在发言中首先批评了人民大学的教条主义和宗派主义。接着他谈到，对于一些反党、反社会主义道路的言论应坚决予以驳斥。他说，这样做是为了划清思想界限，使整风运动更健康地进行，“鸣”“放”得更好。他说，有些人的言论是离开了社会主义原则的。我同章乃器是没有什么私人意见的，但不同意他的言论。他说，章乃器说资产阶级有两面性，工人阶级也有两面性；说资产阶级和工人阶级有区别，但工人和资本家是没有区别的；还说定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获，等等。我认为这些话都是模糊了阶级立场的。我与章乃器的争论，不是理论上的争论，而是两条道路的争论。
    会上，发言的还有杨承祚、刘忆萱、许梦雄、李景汉等人。
