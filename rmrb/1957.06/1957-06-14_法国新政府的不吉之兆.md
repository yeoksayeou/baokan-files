　　Ominous Signs for the New French Government
　　Yuan Xianlu
　　The French government crisis finally ended after lasting three weeks. The National Assembly has approved Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury as the new Prime Minister.

　　No sooner had the new Prime Minister taken office than political figures in Paris began predicting when he would step down. Some even asserted that Bourgès-Maunoury would become one of the shortest-lived Prime Ministers in French history.

　　There are grounds for such a pessimistic assessment of Bourgès-Maunoury's future. Foreign news agencies reported that the National Assembly reacted coldly to his speech requesting authorization; and the voting results were an ominous sign for his cabinet. Out of 596 members, only 240 voted in favor, far from a majority; while 194 voted against. A new Prime Minister gaining confidence with such a slim relative majority is unprecedented since the establishment of the Fourth Republic of France.

　　What is the reason for this situation? The reason is that the activities of Bourgès-Maunoury's cabinet formation do not show any hope of resolving the problems that caused the fall of the Mollet government. The Mollet government had a much broader base when it came to power than Bourgès-Maunoury. And the political and economic situation in France is now much worse than when Mollet took office.

　　So what did Bourgès-Maunoury rely on to come to power? One member of parliament put it wonderfully, "The atmosphere is terrible, but France needs a government." Since Mollet's resignation, the Socialist Party and the conservatives have been arguing endlessly, and a new government could not be formed for a long time. The French ruling group feared that the prolonged crisis would make the situation difficult to manage, so they decided to seek a temporary compromise on the appointment of Bourgès-Maunoury. The new government is a product of such a compromise. On the one hand, Bourgès-Maunoury emphasized that the new government inherited the "continuity in will and action" of the Mollet government, and retained a large part of the original Mollet government team in the new cabinet, thus winning the support of the Socialist Party. On the other hand, he announced that he would maintain and even strengthen the colonial suppression in Algeria, let the notorious Lacoste continue to be responsible for Algerian affairs, and replaced the Minister of Finance, which was another appeasement to the right, thus gaining the votes of confidence of the conservatives.

　　However, none of the various serious problems facing the French government have been reduced.

　　Although the government has been pieced together (basically a joint cabinet of the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist Party), it is full of heavy contradictions. The Radical Socialist Party to which Bourgès-Maunoury belongs is itself divided. There are also great differences of opinion among the Socialist Party leadership. When the Socialist Party parliamentary group and the executive committee voted on whether to participate in the Bourgès-Maunoury cabinet, the votes in favor and against were 58 to 43. As for the conservatives who temporarily voted for confidence and the Popular Republican Party who abstained, they all refused to participate in the cabinet in order to maintain their freedom of action. They can dismantle the new government at any time.

　　The main problem is that the current French economic situation is already facing collapse. Bourgès-Maunoury also admitted that by the end of this month, he would have to use the gold reserves of the Bank of France to cope with the international balance of payments deficit. Although he boasted that he would restore the stability of the franc and establish a highly competitive economy in a year and a half or even a year, what he proposed in his political program was the same old set of methods that Mollet proposed on the eve of his resignation. Since Bourgès-Maunoury has announced that his government will continue to pursue the North Atlantic policy and the Algerian colonial policy that have caused France's current predicament, it is impossible to imagine that he will achieve better results than Mollet.

　　On the contrary, as the Algerian war is prolonged and expanded, and as the French economic situation further deteriorates, the contradictions within the French ruling group will inevitably become more and more acute. With the unprecedentedly fragile foundation of the Bourgès-Maunoury government to cope with an unprecedentedly difficult situation, and without wanting to fundamentally change course, how can it not make observers in Paris make such dark predictions so early.

　　法国新政府的不吉之兆
　　袁先禄
    法国的政府危机延续了三个星期后总算结束了。国民议会已经批准由布歇—莫努里出任新总理。
    新总理刚刚上台，巴黎的政界人士就纷纷预测他将在什么时候下台了。有人甚至断言：布歇—莫努里将成为法国历史上最短命的总理之一。
    人们对布歇—莫努里的前途作出这样悲观的估计，是有根据的。外国通讯社在报道　中指出，国民议会对他的要求授权的演说反应冷淡；而投票的结果，对他的内阁来说，更是一个不吉之兆。在五百九十六名议员中，只有二百四十人投了赞成票，离半数都很远；而投反对票的却有一百九十四人。一个新总理靠这样微弱的相对多数票得到信任，这在法兰西第四共和国成立以来是件空前的事。
    发生这种情况，原因是什么呢？原因是从布歇—莫努里组阁活动看不到解决引起摩勒政府倒台的那些问题的任何希望。摩勒政府当初上台时的基础比布歇—莫努里要广泛得多。而法国政治经济的情况现在却要比摩勒上台时还要恶劣得多。
    那么布歇—莫努里又是凭什么上台的呢？有一个议员说的很妙，“气氛很糟，但是法国需要一个政府。”自从摩勒辞职以来，社会党和保守派之间争吵不已，新政府迟迟不能组成。法国统治集团害怕危机长期延续会使局面难于收拾，所以决定在布歇—莫努里的任命上求得暂时的妥协。新政府就是这样一个妥协的产物。布歇—莫努里一方面强调新政府承自摩勒政府的“在意志和行动上的连续性”，并且把原摩勒政府的班底在新阁中保留下很大一部分，这样博取了社会党的支持。另一方面他宣布要保持甚至加强在阿尔及利亚的殖民镇压，让臭名远扬的拉戈斯特继续负责阿尔及利亚事务，并且换了一个财政部长，这又是对右派的一种讨好，从而取得了保守派的信任票。
    但是，面对法国政府的种种严重问题一个也没有减少。
    政府虽然拼凑起来了（基本上是激进社会党和社会党的联合内阁），但是内部充满着重重的矛盾。布歇—莫努里所属的激进社会党，本身就是分裂的。社会党领导集团中意见也有很大分歧，当社会党议会党团和执行委员会表决是否参加布歇—莫努里内阁的时候，赞成和反对的是五十八票对四十三票。至于暂时投了信任票的保守派和弃了权的人民共和党等等都拒绝参加内阁，以保持它们行动的自由。它们随时都可以拆新政府的台。
    主要的问题是，目前法国经济情况已经面临崩溃的境地。布歇—莫努里也承认，到本月底就会要动用法兰西银行的黄金储备来应付国际收支赤字。他虽然吹嘘要在一年半甚至一年之内恢复法郎的稳定和建立一种竞争能力很强的经济，然而他在政纲里提出来的却是摩勒在下台前夕提出的一套老办法。既然布歇—莫努里已经宣布他的政府将继续推行那个造成法国目前困境的北大西洋政策和阿尔及利亚殖民政策，就无法设想他会获得比摩勒好一点的结果。
    相反，随着阿尔及利亚战争的延长和扩大，随着法国经济情况的进一步恶化，法国统治集团内部的矛盾也势必越来越尖锐。以布歇—莫努里政府空前脆弱的基础而要应付空前困难的局面，又不欲根本上改弦更张，怎么能不使得巴黎的观察家们这样早就作出阴暗的预言。
