　　The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Calls on All Members to Thoroughly Criticize Zhang Bojun's Erroneous Ideology
    This newspaper reports that the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a meeting on the morning of the 17th and passed an urgent telegram to the party's provincial (municipal) organizations and central committee members in various locations. The telegram stated:
    "Comrade Zhang Bojun's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks have aroused public indignation across the country. The Central Executive Bureau unanimously believes that his errors are very serious and have their ideological and historical roots. All party members must strictly distinguish themselves from Zhang Bojun in terms of ideology and political stance, and thoroughly criticize him.
    Zhang Bojun's erroneous remarks cannot represent our party. Resolutely accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and firmly following the socialist road are the firm and unswerving fundamental principles of our party in the past, present, and future. We call on all party members to further unite around the Chinese Communist Party, stand firmly on the socialist position, draw a clear line between ourselves and Zhang Bojun and all right-wing elements, wage a resolute struggle against all anti-socialist remarks, and at the same time continue to help with the rectification campaign."

　　彻底批判章伯钧的错误思想
    本报讯　农工民主党中央执行局17日上午举行会议，通过了给农工民主党各省（市）级组织和在各地的中央委员的急电。电文说：
    “章伯钧同志的反党反社会主义言论，已激起全国人民公愤。中央执行局一致认为他的错误十分严重，并有其思想根源和历史根源。全党同志必须在思想上和政治立场上与章伯钧严格划清界限，并彻底批判。
    章伯钧的错误言论不能代表本党。坚决接受中国共产党领导，坚决走社会主义道路，是本党过去、现在和将来的坚定不移的根本原则。我们号召全党同志进一步团结在中国共产党周围，站稳社会主义立场，与章伯钧和一切右派分子划清界限并和一切反社会主义言论进行坚决斗争，同时继续帮助整风。”
