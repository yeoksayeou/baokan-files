　　Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: Algiers News: Approximately five thousand French colonialist thugs committed atrocities against the Islamic residents of Algiers on June 11th.

　　French thugs attacked and brutally beat Algerians in the streets. Thirteen Muslims were beaten to death by the thugs, and more than fifty were injured. Dozens of shops opened by Algerians were destroyed. Some shops were set on fire. Political observers believe that this is the largest-scale act of violence instigated by French colonialists since French Prime Minister Mollet's visit to Algeria in February 1956.

　　The French army actually participated in this large-scale persecution of Algerian residents. The French army had set up cordons around the Arab residential area the night before, restricting the movement of residents in the area, thereby facilitating the thugs' preparations for the next day's attack.

　　阿尔及尔市发生大血案
    五千法国暴徒在军队掩护下行凶
    据新华社12日电  阿尔及尔消息：法国殖民主义暴徒约五千人6月11日对阿尔及尔市的伊斯兰居民横施残暴。
    法国暴徒们在街道上袭击和猛殴阿尔及利亚人。十三名穆斯林被暴徒打死，五十多名被殴伤。阿尔及利亚人所开设的好几十家店铺被捣毁。有些店铺被纵火焚毁。政治观察家认为，这是1956年2月法国总理摩勒访问阿尔及利亚之后法国殖民主义者所策动的最大规模的暴行。
    法国军队实际上也参与了这次对阿尔及利亚居民的大迫害。法军在前一天晚上在阿拉伯居民区四周布置了警戒线，限制了这个区里居民的行动，从而便利了暴徒们准备第二天的袭击。
