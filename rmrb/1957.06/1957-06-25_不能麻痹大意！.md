Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: In mid-June, two breaches occurred in the dikes of the Fuyang River, a tributary of the Ziya River in Hebei Province, and some of the wheat that had not yet been harvested along the river was flooded. The wheat has now been reaped, and the breaches have been plugged.

The breaches in the Fuyang River were entirely due to the carelessness of local cadres. In both places, the culverts used for irrigation had not been properly sealed. When the river rose, there were no guards on the dikes at night and in the early morning, and no materials were prepared for emergency repairs. When water leakage was discovered on both sides of the culverts and the danger expanded, they were caught off guard, resulting in the breaches.

The Central Flood Control Headquarters believes that although the losses caused by the Fuyang River breach incident were not large, it was a lesson of great significance. To draw the attention of all regions, the Central Flood Control Headquarters issued a circular about this matter yesterday, requiring all regions to fully prepare for the flood season to prevent similar incidents from occurring. At the same time, Hebei Province was instructed to conduct an inspection and handle the matter.

　　不能麻痹大意！
    据新华社22日讯　6月中旬，河北省子牙河支流滏阳河堤两处决口，沿河有一部分还没有收割的小麦被淹。现在小麦已经抢收，决口已经堵上。
    这次滏阳河决口完全是由于当地干部麻痹大意造成的。这两处都是原来浇地的涵洞没有堵实，河里涨水时，夜间和清晨堤上无人看守，又没有准备抢险物料，待发觉涵洞两边漏水，险情扩大时措手不及，造成决口。
    中央防汛总指挥部认为：这次滏阳河决口事件造成的损失虽然不大，却是一次意义重大的教训。为引起各地注意，中央防汛总指挥部把这件事昨天发了通报，要求各地充分做好汛期准备，以防类似事件出现。同时责成河北省对此进行检查处理。
