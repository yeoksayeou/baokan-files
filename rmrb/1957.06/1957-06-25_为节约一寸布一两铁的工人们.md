　　Recently, I continuously visited the workers of the sewing, leather shoe, and hardware handicraft production cooperatives in Guangzhou City. To increase wealth for the country, they have come up with many ways to use fewer raw materials and produce more products.

　　In the workshop of the Guangzhou No. 1 Sewing Production Cooperative, when I visited, the members were busy sewing various women's clothing. The cutter carefully measured the size of the cloth and cut out shirts of different sizes according to the size of the cloth. Liang Ruijuan, the director of the cooperative, told me that in the past they cut the same size shirts regardless of the size of the cloth, resulting in a lot of leftover scraps. She also said that this year their cooperative has designed a total of thirty-six kinds of clothing, all designed according to the principles of saving and beauty. Because of paying attention to saving, the entire cooperative saved 136 meters of cotton cloth in April and May alone.

　　In the window of the Guangzhou No. 1 Leather Shoe Production Cooperative's store, there are many beautiful and material-efficient leather shoes on display. Several kinds of women's sandals currently popular in Guangzhou are lightweight, cool, beautiful, and save materials. The soles of these sandals are made using the "wrapping" method (i.e., first making the sole out of wood, wrapping it with a leather edge, and then adding a layer of leather sole). Using this method, ten pairs of sole leather can make thirteen pairs of shoes. The uppers are mostly made of scrap leather. Among the men's shoes, there are also those made of pieced scrap leather or a combination of good and substandard leather, which are quite popular with customers because of their fashionable and attractive styles.

　　This cooperative has already saved more than 3,000 yuan worth of raw materials from January to May.

　　When I visited the Minsheng Hardware Production Cooperative, I saw piles of scrap steel as soon as I entered the gate. The members of this cooperative told me that the new screws they produce are made from these scraps.

　　The Minsheng Hardware Production Cooperative has difficulty sourcing raw materials. The steel supplied by the state can only meet 20% to 30% of their needs. In the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, the members studied each other and made extensive use of scrap materials to manufacture screws. Now, the utilization rate of scrap materials in their cooperative has reached over 80%. Most of the screws produced each month are made from scrap materials. Because scrap materials are cheaper, the average product cost has been reduced by 60%. The members have not delayed production, and their income has also been guaranteed. In the first quarter, the entire cooperative also accumulated more than 4,000 yuan in funds.

　　After the cooperative made extensive use of scrap materials this year, the product quality has improved compared to last year. In the fourth quarter of last year, the total weight of screws returned for rework was more than 1,300 jin, but in the first quarter of this year, the weight of screws returned for rework was only 350 jin. Due to the good quality and low price of the screws, many state-owned factories, such as the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, have placed orders with this cooperative.

### 为节约一寸布一两铁的工人们

　　为节约一寸布一两铁的工人们
　　新华社记者　黄成
    记者近日连续地访问了广州市缝纫、皮鞋、五金三个行业的手工业生产合作社的工人们，他们为了给国家增加财富，想出了很多少用原料、多产产品的办法。
    在广州市第一缝纫生产合作社的工场里，记者去访问的时候，社员们正在忙碌地缝制各种女装。剪裁师细心地量了布的大小，根据布的大小裁出不同号码的衬衫。社主任梁瑞娟告诉记者，过去他们不管布的大小，都裁同一号码的衬衫，结果剩下来的碎布很多。她还说，今年他们合作社共设计了三十六种服装，都是根据节约美观的原则来设计的。因为注意节约，仅4、5两个月全社就节约了一百三十六公尺棉布。
    在广州市第一皮鞋生产合作社门市部的橱窗里，陈列着许多式样美观而用料不多的皮鞋。目前风行广州的几种妇女凉鞋，都轻便、凉快、美观、省料。这些凉鞋的鞋底用“包边”的方法制成（即先用木头制成鞋底，包上皮边，再上一层皮底）。用这种方法，十双鞋底皮可制十三双鞋。鞋面多用碎皮制成。在男鞋中也有用碎皮拼制或者用好次皮子搭配制成的，由于式样时新好看，颇受顾客欢迎。
    这个合作社在1月到5月内，已经节约了价值三千多元的原材料。
    记者去访问民生五金生产合作社，走进大门就看到一堆堆钢铁废料，这个社的社员们告诉我，他们所生产的新的螺丝就是用这些废料制成的。
    民生五金生产合作社的原料来源很困难，国家供应给他们的钢铁只能满足需要的20％到30％。社员们在增产节约运动中，就互相研究，大量利用废料制造螺丝。现在，他们社里的废料利用率达到80％以上。每月生产的螺丝钉有大半是用废料制造的。因为废料比较便宜，产品成本平均降低了60％。社员没有耽搁生产，收入也有了保证。第一季度全合作社还积累了资金四千多元。
    这个社今年大量利用废料以后，产品质量比去年还有提高。去年第四季度返工退货的螺丝钉重量共一千三百多斤，但今年第一季度返工退货的螺丝钉重量只有三百五十多斤。由于螺丝钉质量好、价钱低，广州通用机器厂等许多国营大工厂都向这个合作社订货。
