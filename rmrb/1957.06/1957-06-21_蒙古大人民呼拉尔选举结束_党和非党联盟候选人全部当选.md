　　蒙古大人民呼拉尔选举结束
    党和非党联盟候选人全部当选
    本报综合报道　蒙古第三届大人民呼拉尔在16日举行选举，全国二百三十三个选区同时进行投票。
    蒙古首都乌兰巴托共分三十个选区，选民们一早就穿上新衣，扶老携幼地到投票站去行使他们的公民权。第二十三选区第五投票站设在肉类联合加工厂的俱乐部里，蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔连续三届被这个选区提名为候选人。
    蒙古中央选举委员会20日发布的第三届大人民呼拉尔选举的结果表明，蒙古党和非党联盟提出的二百三十三个候选人全部当选。全国有五十万零九千三百七十七人（占选民的99.98％）投了上述候选人的票。
    在6月16日选举中参加投票的选民共有五十万零九千四百九十四人，占选民总数的99.99％。
    选举委员会同时公布了当选代表的名单。
    第一届大人民呼拉尔是在1924年11月举行的。在这以后到1949年2月曾经举行过九届大人民呼拉尔会议。在第九届大人民呼拉尔会议上，对原来的宪法作了修改，规定以直接选举代替多级选举，以秘密选举代替公开选举，并且规定大人民呼拉尔每届任期三年。在宪法修改以后，大人民呼拉尔又进行过两届选举，这次选举所以叫做第三届大人民呼拉尔选举，就是从宪法修改后计算的。
    大人民呼拉尔每年举行一次常会。它选举主席一人和副主席二人。现任主席是策·杜格苏伦。
    在大人民呼拉尔闭会期间，由大人民呼拉尔主席团代行其职权。主席团是由大人民呼拉尔选举产生的。主席团由主席一人、副主席一人、秘书一人和委员四人组成。现任主席是扎木斯朗金·桑布。
