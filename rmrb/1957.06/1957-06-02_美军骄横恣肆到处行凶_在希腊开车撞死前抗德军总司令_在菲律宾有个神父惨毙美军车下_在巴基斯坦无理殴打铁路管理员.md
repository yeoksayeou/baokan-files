Xinhua News Agency, June 1st dispatch: Athens news: Former Greek Commander-in-Chief of Anti-German Forces, General Sarafis, was killed by a U.S. military truck on May 31st. This incident has aroused protests from the Greek people.

After the news of the tragic death of this leader of the Greek resistance movement during World War II spread, members of the United Democratic Left, attending a meeting of the Legislative Committee of the Greek Parliament, immediately withdrew from the meeting to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military and demanded that the government step up measures to abolish the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by U.S. military personnel.

Sarafis was a member of the Greek Parliament and the leader of the Greek United Democratic Left. His wife was also seriously injured in the car accident. Her right leg has been surgically amputated, and her condition remains critical.

The Greek government has taken large-scale precautionary measures throughout Greece to prevent the outbreak of anti-American anger among the people. The government has implemented particularly strict precautions in Sarafis's own constituency.

Regarding the whereabouts of the perpetrator, U.S. Air Force Sergeant Musari, the current statements are inconsistent. Some sources say that Musari is still under the custody of the U.S. military authorities. The Greek government announced that the U.S. Ambassador to Greece has promised to hand Musari over to the Greek authorities, and Musari has been detained in a Greek police station.

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st dispatch: Manila news: The Philippine court issued an arrest warrant last night for a U.S. Air Force sergeant.

The defendant, Joseph Marshall, is a sergeant at Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga Province, Central Luzon Island. He drove a car on May 28th and killed Filipino priest Elias Reyes.

The U.S. Air Force Base authorities at Clark have admitted that Marshall was not on duty when the accident occurred. Marshall has been detained by the U.S. Air Force Base authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, May 31st dispatch: According to a report by the Pakistan Press Association on May 30th, two Americans in the vicinity of Kamp Bulipur in West Pakistan beat a level crossing gatekeeper of the Northwest Railway and verbally abused him and his country. The dispute caused the Chenab express train to be delayed by thirty minutes.

When the two Americans drove their car to a level crossing near Burhan station, the Chenab express train was approaching, so the barrier was lowered. However, they insisted that the gatekeeper raise the barrier and let them pass. They refused to listen to the gatekeeper's explanation, instead beating and scolding him and insulting Pakistan.

In order to prevent an accident, the traffic police gave a signal, and the express train had to stop.

When the railway authorities asked the two Americans to give their names, they not only refused to show their identity cards but also continued to insult Pakistan and its people. Later, one of them said that he was Captain Miller.

    美军骄横恣肆到处行凶
    在希腊开车撞死前抗德军总司令  在菲律宾有个神父惨毙美军车下在巴基斯坦无理殴打铁路管理员
    新华社1日讯　雅典消息：前希腊抗德军总司令萨拉非斯将军5月31日被美国军用卡车撞死。这个事件激起了希腊人民的抗议。
    这位第二次世界大战期间的希腊抵抗运动领袖惨遭牺牲的消息传出后，出席希腊议会立法委员会会议的左翼民主联盟议员立即退出会场，以抗议美军暴行，并且要求政府加紧采取措施取消美国军人享有的治外法权。
    萨拉非斯是希腊议会的议员，希腊左翼民主联盟的领袖。他的妻子也在撞车时受重伤，她的右腿已动手术割去，伤势仍然严重。
    希腊政府已经在希腊全境采取大规模的戒备措施，以防止人民反美怒潮的爆发。政府在萨拉非斯本人的选区里实行了特别严厉的戒备。
    关于肇事人美国空军军士木萨里的下落，目前的说法还不一致。有消息说：木萨里还在美国军事当局的看管下。而希腊政府宣布：美国驻希腊大使已经答应将木萨里交给希腊当局，木萨里已经关在希腊警察局的看守所里。
    新华社1日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾法院昨天晚上对一个美国空军军士发出了逮捕证。
    被告约瑟夫·马歇尔是中吕宋岛邦邦牙省克拉克空军基地的上士。他在5月28日驾驶汽车撞死了菲律宾神父埃利亚斯·雷耶斯。
    克拉克美国空军基地当局已经承认，马歇尔肇祸的时候不是在值勤。马歇尔已经由美国空军基地当局拘留。
    新华社卡拉奇5月31日电　据巴基斯坦报联社5月30日报道，两个美国人在西巴基斯坦坎普布利珀附近殴打了一个西北铁路上的交叉点管理员，并且谩骂他和他的国家。这次纠纷使契纳布的快车误点三十分钟。
    当这两个美国人驾着汽车驶到布尔汉车站附近一个交叉点的时候，契纳布的快车正在开过来，因此，栅栏放下了。但是他们硬要管理员收起栅栏，让他们过去。他们不听管理员的解释，反而打骂了这个管理员，并且辱骂巴基斯坦。
    为了火车不出事故，交通警打起信号，快车也只得停了下来。
    当铁路当局要求这两个美国人讲出他们的名字时，他们非但不交出身份证，还继续辱骂巴基斯坦和它的人民。后来，其中的一个说，他是上尉米勒。
