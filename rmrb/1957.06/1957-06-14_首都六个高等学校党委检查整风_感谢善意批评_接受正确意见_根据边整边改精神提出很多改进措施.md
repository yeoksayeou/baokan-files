Xinhua News Agency, June 13th Special Dispatch: The heads of the Chinese Communist Party Committees of six universities in the capital today delivered preliminary inspection reports on the rectification issue at meetings of faculty, staff, and students in their respective schools. They expressed gratitude to all individuals who actively helped the Party in the rectification campaign by offering sincere criticism. They also expressed acceptance of the correct opinions that were put forward and provided explanations for some issues that required further study.

The rectification movement of Party organizations in Beijing universities began successively in mid-May. During this period, Party organizations in various schools, through symposiums and other measures, extensively listened to the opinions and criticisms of non-Party members. With the exception of a very small number of rightists who, in the name of helping the Party rectify, put forward some reactionary remarks that hated the Communist Party and socialism, the vast majority of non-Party members made sharp but well-intentioned criticisms of the Party. They exposed bad phenomena such as subjectivism in teaching, sectarianism in organization, and bureaucratism in work style in various schools. At the same time, many people also put forward many useful suggestions accordingly. The heads of the Chinese Communist Party Committees of the six universities, who spoke at the plenary meetings of their respective schools today, all affirmed this situation. After conducting preliminary self-criticism, they repeatedly expressed their gratitude to all non-Party members who sincerely offered opinions and criticisms to the Party. They also hoped that they would continue to actively help the Party in the rectification campaign so that the Party could better share with everyone the responsibility of cultivating talents for socialist construction.

In their reports, they sincerely accepted many useful opinions put forward by the vast number of non-Party members. Zhang Zhiqiang, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said: Professor Lin Qiaozhi said that she had many things she wanted to talk to the leadership about, but she went back into her house several times. This shows how eager everyone is to contact the leading cadres and talk about their inner thoughts. Professor Zhu Guiqing once said that if the leading cadres of our hospital could go to the laboratory to rinse bottles, it would be much better than participating in other labor. Professor Zhang Yun severely criticized us for using the experts of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences too much in the past, but not training them enough, and put forward many opinions, which were not accepted. He said that these opinions were very beneficial to us.

These responsible persons all reviewed the mistakes in their past work. Jiang Nanxiang, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University, said: It was good to pay attention to learning from the Soviet Union's experience in teaching work, but it was not enough to combine it with China's actual situation. Therefore, the phenomenon of exceeding class hours was very serious when implementing it. The plan was revised four times, which caused a series of changes in the school's teaching work. In addition, we did not remind everyone to pay attention to learning from the experience of veteran professors in teaching, so that some young teachers even used the method of mechanically copying the Soviet experience to criticize the teaching work of veteran professors. Detachment from the actual situation of the school also existed in the issue of improving the quality of teaching. For example, when summarizing in 1955, in order to further improve the quality of teaching, we proposed the goal of "catching up with the Soviet level in three to five years," but because we did not put forward specific content and implementation methods, it resulted in an excessive burden on teachers and students. In terms of Party-masses relations, we did not respect the powers of non-Party administrative heads enough and consulted them too little. The phenomenon of simplification generally existed in ideological work. The democratic style was poor, and the relationship between Party members and non-Party masses was not close enough. He said: As for myself, I had very little contact with Mr. Meng Zhaoying, and I did not talk to the students who lived in the same room with me in the countryside.

Zhang Zhiqiang, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, reviewed the shortcomings of not combining with the characteristics of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences when carrying out reforms in the past. He said that the comprehensive nature of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the ward system, the training system for medical students and resident physicians were basically good; the atmosphere of academic research was also strong, and the administrative management system and promotion system also had their merits, but in the past, they were not well studied, and their dross was not removed, and their essence was not retained. After the Three-Anti and ideological reform, they were cancelled with an attitude of negating everything. He said that this was wrong.

In accordance with the spirit of rectification and correction simultaneously, they all focused on putting forward many measures to improve work and correct mistakes in their reports. Yan Ziyuan, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Petroleum Institute, said that the institute has begun to correct the unreasonable allocation of work to some non-Party cadres in the past. Wang Peiqing, who had worked in the teaching affairs office of this institute for seventeen years, was inappropriately transferred to the publishing section as deputy section chief last year. Now Wang Peiqing has been transferred back to the teaching affairs office to serve in his original position. Regarding the problem of excessive study burden on students at the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, the Party Committee of this institute has instructed special personnel to conduct a week-long investigation, and the investigation report will be submitted next week. Regarding the improvement of production practice, this institute has held a meeting of student representatives and a special meeting for research, and preparations for production practice have now begun.

In the process of rectification, the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, in accordance with the spirit of rectification and correction simultaneously, specially established a research group to study the unreasonable distribution of housing. The reform plan that was drawn up was revised six or seven times, and it has now begun to solve the problem of unreasonable housing. Two hundred and ten households have been properly settled, and one or twenty households have not yet been able to be resolved immediately. Some members of the Party Committee and Party member section chiefs of the Party Committee of this institute have voluntarily requested to move from large houses to smaller houses, so that more populous comrades can live there. Xu Juefei, President of the Institute, Sun Jinglu, Vice President, and Wang Ruisheng, Deputy Director of the Personnel Department, have all voluntarily returned their welfare subsidies. The Party organization of Beijing Railway Institute requested that Party cadres, with the exception of elderly teachers, cancel all priority certificates for taking care of the lives of senior intellectuals that they had previously received. Some Party cadres even voluntarily proposed to return part of their welfare benefits.

Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, Petroleum Institute, and Agricultural Mechanization Institute each had seven Party cadres with excessively high levels who voluntarily proposed to lower their levels. The Party Committees of these schools officially announced today that they agreed to lower them by one level.

They also raised different opinions on certain remarks made by a small number of people. Zhang Zhiqiang, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said that in the past, there was a shortcoming of not paying attention to technology in the training, education, promotion and use of cadres, but it is wrong for individual comrades to think that attaching importance to political improvement and political conditions is also wrong. For example, some comrades pointed out the mistakes and shortcomings of some Party members, but ignored their advantages, or inferred from this that the whole Party was wrong, which is also wrong. For example, there were indeed mistakes and shortcomings in the past political movements, which hurt some comrades, and these criticisms are correct and are now being carefully and meticulously studied, but it is also wrong to negate the achievements of the past political movements because of this.

Wang Xiaoci, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Railway Institute, said: Some people think that talent is replaced by virtue in schools now, and some people think that Marxism-Leninism is inseparable from dogmatism, and that Marxism-Leninism cannot be used as a guiding ideology. He said that they will further mobilize all faculty, staff and students to conduct large-scale discussions on these issues, and distinguish between right and wrong through "contending" and "blooming."

The Party secretaries of these schools expressed their strong confidence in the future rectification movement in their reports. Yan Ziyuan, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Petroleum Institute, said: We Communists are determined to study and absorb the opinions of people inside and outside the Party, and carry out criticism and self-criticism together to do a good job in the rectification campaign. Our Communist Party is the party of the working class, and there are no shortcomings and mistakes that we are unwilling to abandon.

Sun Jinglu, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, after reviewing his shortcomings, said that he would soon take time to have earnest talks with non-Party Vice President Sun Wenyu and some veteran professors, representative faculty and staff, and students, go to their homes, sit down and talk heart to heart, and further solicit their opinions.

　　首都六个高等学校党委检查整风
　　感谢善意批评　接受正确意见
　　根据边整边改精神提出很多改进措施
    本报特约新华社13日讯　首都六个高等学校的中共委员会的负责人，今天分别在各校师生员工大会上就整风问题作了初步的检查报告，向积极帮助党整风——向党提出善意批评的所有人士表示感谢，同时对于他们所提出的正确的意见表示接受，对于一些须待继续研究的问题也作了说明。
    北京各高等学校党组织的整风运动，是在5月中旬陆续开始的。在这期间，各校党组织通过座谈会和其他一些措施，曾广泛地听取了党外人士的意见和批评。其中除极少数右派分子在帮助党整风的名义下，提出一些仇视共产党、仇视社会主义的反动言论外，绝大多数的党外人士都对党提出了尖锐的但是出自善意的批评，揭露了各校教学中的主观主义、组织上的宗派主义和工作作风上的官僚主义等不良现象，许多人同时还相应地提出了很多有益的建议。今天在这六个高等学校全校大会上分别发言的各校中共委员会的负责人，都一致肯定了这种形势。他们在进行了初步的自我批评之后，曾一再对善意地向党提出意见和批评的所有党外人士表示感激之忱，并且希望他们继续积极地帮助党整风，以便使党更好地和大家共同担负起培养社会主义建设人才的责任。
  他们在报告中十分诚恳地接受了广大党外人士所提出的许多有益的意见。中共中国协和医学院委员会书记张之强说：林巧稚教授说过，她有许多话要想和领导上谈谈，但几次走出自己的房子却又回去了。这说明大家是多么渴望和领导干部接触，谈谈心里话。朱贵卿教授曾说过本院领导干部参加劳动，若能到实验室去涮涮瓶子，比参加其他劳动好的多。张鋆教授曾严厉批评我们过去对协和医学院的专家们使用多，培养少，提了很多意见，不被接受。他说，这些意见对我们都是很有益的。
    这些负责人对过去工作上的错误都作了检讨。中共清华大学委员会书记蒋南翔说：在教学工作上注意学习苏联的经验这是好的，但结合中国的实际情况不够，因而在执行时超学时现象非常严重，把计划修改了四次，使全校教学工作随着引起了一系列的变化。另外在教学上也没有提醒大家注意吸取老教授的经验，以致有的青年教师甚至用机械搬用苏联经验的办法责备老教授的教学工作。在提高教学质量的问题上也脱离了学校的实际。如1955年总结时，为了进一步提高教学质量，提出了“三至五年赶上苏联水平”的奋斗目标，但因为没有提出具体内容和实现方法而产生了教师和学生负担过重的后果。在党群关系上，对非党行政负责人职权尊重不够，商量太少。思想工作中比较普遍地存在简单化的现象。民主作风差，党员与非党群众关系不够密切。他说：就我自己而言，同孟昭英先生接触就很少，和一起下乡的同住一屋的同学也未单独交谈过。
    中共中国协和医学院委员会书记张之强检查了过去进行改革时没有结合协和医学院特点的缺点。他说协和医学院的综合性、病房制度、医学生和住院医师培养制度，基本上都是好的；学术研究空气也是浓厚的，行政管理制度和晋级制度也有可取之处，但是过去没有很好地加以研究，去其糟粕，留其精华，在三反、思想改造之后，以否定一切的态度加以取消了。他说这是错误的。
    根据边整边改的精神，他们在报告中都着重提出了许多改进工作和改正错误的措施。中共北京石油学院委员会书记阎子元说，学院过去对某些非党干部的工作分配不合理的地方，现在已着手纠正。曾经在这个学院作过十七年教务工作的王佩卿，去年曾被不恰当地调到出版科任副科长，现在王佩卿已经调回教务科担任原职。北京农业机械化学院学生学习负担过重的问题，这个学院的党委会曾责成专人进行为时一周的调查，下一周即可提出调查报告。关于改进生产实习的问题，这个学院已召开过学生代表会议和一次专门会议进行了研究，现在已开始生产实习的筹备工作。
    北京农业机械化学院在整风过程中根据边整边改的精神，就住房分配不合理问题专门成立了研究小组，拟定出的改革方案修改了六、七次，现已开始着手解决住房不合理的问题，已有二百一十户各得其所，还有一、二十户尚未能立即解决。这个学院的党委会有的党委委员和党员科长级干部自动要求从大房子里搬到较小的房子去，让给人口多的同志去住。学院院长徐觉非、副院长孙景鲁和人事处副处长王瑞生等都自动退还了福利补助费。北京铁道学院党组织要求党员干部除老年教师外，一律取消以前领到的照顾高级知识分子生活的优先证。有的党员干部并自觉的提出退还一部分福利费。
    北京外国语学院、石油学院和农业机械化学院，各有七个级别偏高的党员干部，自动提出降低级别。这些学校的党委会今天正式宣布同意他们下降一级。
    他们对少数人的某些言论，也提出了不同的意见。中共中国协和医学院委员会书记张之强说，过去对干部的培养教育、提拔使用上有不重视技术的缺点，但有个别同志认为重视政治提高和政治条件也是错误的就不对了。又如有的同志指出了一些党员的错误、缺点，但忽视了他们尚有优点，或者由此而推论全党都是错误，这也是不对的。 再如历次政治运动中确有错误和缺点并因而伤害了某些同志，这些批评是正确的，现在正在慎重仔细地研究，但因此而否定历次政治运动的成绩也是错误的。
    中共北京铁道学院委员会书记王孝慈说：有人认为现在学校里以德代才，也有人认为马列主义与教条主义不可分，马列主义不能作为指导思想等问题。他说他们将进一步发动全院师生员工就这些问题进行大规模的讨论，从“争鸣”“齐放”中辩明是非。
    这些学校的党委书记们在报告中对今后的整风运动表示了坚强的信心。中共北京石油学院委员会书记阎子元说：我们共产党人，一定有决心研究吸收党外党内的意见，并开展批评与自我批评，一起要把整风搞好。我们共产党是工人阶级的政党，没有什么缺点错误不愿放弃的。
    中共北京农业机械化学院委员会书记孙景鲁在检查了自己的缺点以后，表示在最近就要抽暇和非党副院长孙文郁及一些老教授、有代表性的教职员、学生进行恳谈，到他们家里，坐下来谈心，进一步征求他们的意见。
