Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The Joint Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), after four sessions of discussion, today passed a joint directive calling on industrialists and businessmen and members of the CNDCA across the country to immediately launch a resolute struggle against Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist statements, and to impose organizational sanctions on Zhang Naiqi.

The joint meeting announced today that local organizations of the CNDCA and ACFIC in eighteen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Sichuan, Jilin, Shaanxi, Guangxi, and Henan, had sent letters and telegrams expressing their indignation at Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks and demanding organizational sanctions against him. During today's meeting, such letters, telegrams, and long-distance calls arrived frequently. Based on the requests of local organizations, the Standing Committees of the CNDCA Central Committee and the ACFIC decided to give Zhang Naiqi the sanction of "suspension from all duties within the association and ordered to make a self-criticism." The thirty-four members of the CNDCA Central Committee Standing Committee and the forty-five members of the ACFIC Standing Committee present at the meeting unanimously raised their hands to approve the decision.

Qian Jiaju, Rong Yiren, Huang Jieran, and others criticized Zhang Naiqi's remarks again this afternoon. Zhang Naiqi did not attend today's meeting.

The joint directive of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on "Industrialists and Businessmen Across the Country Unite and Immediately Launch a Resolute Struggle Against Zhang Naiqi's Anti-Socialist Activities" stated that in the past two months, industrialists and businessmen, like people from all walks of life, have conscientiously expressed their opinions and actively helped the Party in its rectification campaign. However, right-wing elements have taken this opportunity, using the pretext of helping the Party's rectification, to viciously launch activities against the Party, the working class, and to sabotage the socialist cause. Zhang Naiqi is a prominent representative of these right-wing elements.

The directive stated that Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialism has a long history, and he has constantly used opportunities to spread his political poison. When the CNDCA held its Second Plenary Session last winter, comrades severely criticized him. Recently, Zhang Naiqi took advantage of the opportunity to help the Party in its rectification campaign and made a series of absurd anti-socialist remarks, creating extremely bad influence. In order to repel the right-wing elements' attack on socialism, the Standing Committees of our two associations convened a joint meeting to severely criticize Zhang Naiqi and help him correct his mistakes. However, in the meeting, he not only did not accept the well-intentioned, repeated, and patient help of the comrades, but continued to provoke and instigate the industrial and commercial circles, and insisted on his anti-socialist activities. Our two associations had to take timely measures to crush Zhang Naiqi's reactionary political behavior.

Zhang Naiqi's reactionary political behavior is to oppose the leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, and to oppose our people's building of socialism and taking the socialist road. He shamelessly promoted the theory of the red bourgeoisie, advocating that there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and workers, that the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual character, and that like the working class, there are only advanced and backward elements. This kind of talk that confuses class distinctions is, in essence, a denial of the leadership of the working class. He distorted Stalin's description of the qualities of a Communist Party member, even comparing Communist Party members to the political swindler Li Wanming. This sinister tactic of vilifying Communist Party members is, in essence, aimed at shaking the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He exaggerated the shortcomings and errors in the work under the socialist system as flaws in the socialist system itself, making people feel that socialism seems to be nothing but bureaucracy. His statement that bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism is even more naked slander of socialism and blatant promotion of capitalist restoration.

The directive stated that in order to achieve his anti-socialist political goals, Zhang Naiqi has exhausted all shameless means such as distortion, provocation, incitement, deception, and paralysis against the industrial and commercial circles. First, he quoted out of context, distorted Chairman Mao's words, and played his trick of passing off fish eyes for pearls, using falsehoods to confuse the truth. Second, he used the weaknesses in the ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen to carry out intimidation and incitement, fabricating rumors that others said that after the high tide of socialist transformation, the dual character of the bourgeoisie is still politically counter-revolutionary and economically contains the five evils. He described the "thorough transformation" of industrialists and businessmen as "drawing out tendons and peeling off skin," attempting to stir up the dissatisfaction of industrialists and businessmen with the Party and the government. Third, under the guise of caring for the feelings of industrialists and businessmen and giving play to their initiative, he carried out vicious paralysis and deception against industrialists and businessmen. He said that industrialists and businessmen no longer exploit, and that fixed interest is not exploitation; he said that the bourgeoisie can love socialism without transformation, and that bringing means of production into socialism is more glorious than those who shout slogans and paste posters empty-handed. In essence, he wanted industrialists and businessmen not to see the negative aspects of capitalism that still exist in themselves, and to relax their further ideological transformation. Fourth, and even more egregious, under the guise of anti-doctrinairism, he used revisionism to attack Marxism-Leninism, and used bourgeois ideology to oppose working-class ideology, labeling all arguments and ideas that contradict his views as doctrinairism, metaphysics, or the theory of solely relying on class background. Zhang Naiqi's insidious and vicious tactics have been consistent, but recently they have intensified.

It can be seen that Zhang Naiqi's series of absurd statements are no longer an ideological issue, let alone a theoretical debate, but a reactionary political action issue. This is a struggle between two roads: socialism and capitalism.

The directive stated that the greatest and most long-term interests of industrialists and businessmen across the country are to smoothly pass through the road of the transition period and transform themselves into workers in the true sense of the word. In the past few years, we have accepted socialist transformation, fundamentally changed the ownership of the means of production, and embarked on the socialist road. However, it should be seen that we industrialists and businessmen have not yet separated ourselves from the roots of the exploiters, and the dual character of the class still exists. Therefore, the important issue now facing each of us is to further transform our bourgeois ideology, gradually change our position, viewpoints, and methods, so that we can move forward on the socialist road with more steadfast steps. According to the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions that mistakes must be criticized and poisonous weeds must be struggled against, the organizations of our two associations at all levels must immediately organize and lead local members and industrialists and businessmen to launch a resolute struggle against Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist activities. When struggling against Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist activities, we should pay attention to: drawing a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements in terms of ideology and action, testing ourselves, training ourselves, and standing firm. It is necessary to explain well to all members and industrialists and businessmen that the nature of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary activities is completely different from the general ideological errors or unclear understanding of industrialists and businessmen. According to the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, we should criticize all shortcomings and errors. Even if some things are said incorrectly, or if we do not yet have a correct understanding of some issues, they are all general ideological issues within the people, and can be handled by adopting the method of unity-criticism-unity.

Qian Jiaju, Rong Yiren, Li Zhuchen, and Others Continue to Criticize Zhang Naiqi
Zhang Naiqi is Using Sweet Words
To Deceive Industrialists and Businessmen to Take the Capitalist Dead End

At today's meeting, Qian Jiaju, on behalf of Sun Xiaocun, Wu Dakun, Feng Hefa, and himself, made a lengthy joint statement. This joint statement made a profound analysis and rebuttal of Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist fallacies. Qian Jiaju's speech focused on pointing out that the ideological source of Zhang Naiqi is the negative side of the dual character of the bourgeoisie; its specific manifestations are in his views on issues such as class relations, the dual character, the redemption policy, the further transformation of industrialists and businessmen, and the socialist system. And these views are no longer within the category of theoretical exploration, but a matter of political line. He said: The essence of the struggle between us and Zhang Naiqi is a struggle between two lines.

In his speech, Rong Yiren first reported on the situation of the criticism of Zhang Naiqi's erroneous remarks by the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai. He explained that in recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CNDCA and the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce have separately or jointly held a series of meetings to criticize Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist fallacies. The meeting unanimously held that Zhang Naiqi's remarks are sugar-coated poison, a concentrated manifestation of the negative side of the bourgeoisie, and believed that the criticism of Zhang Naiqi is a struggle between two lines, socialism and capitalism. Rong Yiren said that the criticism of Zhang Naiqi by the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai is only the beginning, and will continue to be deepened in the future. He also reflected the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles' request that the CNDCA Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce promptly take organizational measures against Zhang Naiqi's serious errors of spreading absurd remarks and endangering the socialist transformation cause.

Rong Yiren then talked about his views on several issues in Zhang Naiqi's published erroneous fallacies. He said that he would talk about these issues from the perspective of an industrialist and businessman. First, regarding the question of whether fixed interest is exploitation, Rong Yiren said: Since the implementation of fixed interest, I have had some knots in my mind. I thought that in the past, capitalists controlled the means of production and occupied the surplus value created by workers, which was exploitation. Now the situation has changed, and the working class gives fixed interest to capitalists. Is this exploitation? I have consulted some comrades, and now I think that the relationship between industrialists and businessmen and the means of production has not been completely cut off. If it is said that it has been completely cut off, where does the fixed interest come from? From this, it can be seen that fixed interest is still a kind of exploitation. Because we are willing to take the socialist road, and in order to better transform us industrialists and businessmen, the working class tolerates our exploitation for a certain period of time. However, when Li Kangnian proposed to fix the interest for twenty years, the workers rose up in opposition. Therefore, we cannot deny that fixed interest is exploitation just because the working class tolerates exploitation.

Rong Yiren said: Zhang Naiqi said that the dual character is a matter of advanced and backward. I think that since fixed interest is exploitation, then exploitation is the negative side of the bourgeoisie. It's just that the situation is different from before. In the capitalist period, it was unlimited exploitation, and now it is limited exploitation. In work, there are also many facts that show that the negative nature of the bourgeoisie exists. For example, some people ask to have the label of bourgeoisie removed on the one hand, and want fixed interest for twenty years on the other hand. Isn't this full of capitalist ideas? Some people ask to be trusted in their work and to be treated equally, while asking for special care in life and arrangements. Isn't this also a manifestation of negativity? In such a situation, can it be said that industrialists and businessmen are mainly inferior and timid? Can it be said that industrialists and businessmen do not have individualism, selfishness, and self-interest, and are completely the same as the working class? There are also advanced and backward elements in the working class, but there are no people in the working class who rely on the means of production to exploit. From this, it can be seen that the advanced and backward within the working class are essentially different from the dual character of the bourgeoisie.

Rong Yiren said: Zhang Naiqi took advantage of the weaknesses of industrialists and businessmen and used all his abilities to paralyze and provoke. For example, industrialists and businessmen are afraid of mentioning "exploitation," so he said that fixed interest is not exploitation, making the industrial and commercial circles have a blurred understanding. Zhang Naiqi also emphasized that now we should only talk about cooperative relations and not about class relations, that the bourgeoisie does not have a dual character, etc. Saying this seems to mean that industrialists and businessmen do not need to be transformed, which is to pull us back to the old road of capitalism. This is completely contrary to our industrialists and businessmen's desire to take the socialist road. If the bourgeoisie wants to take the capitalist road, the workers, peasants, and working people across the country will resolutely oppose it, which is a dead end for industrialists and businessmen.

Rong Yiren also criticized Zhang Naiqi's fallacy that bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism. He said that Zhang Naiqi's sentence fully exposed his love and nostalgia for capitalism. Bureaucracy is a problem that exists in work, and it is a matter within the people, while capitalism is a system that is hostile to socialism. According to Zhang Naiqi, is the problem within the people more dangerous than the hostile problem? This confuses the distinction between the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves and the contradiction within the people, which is extremely wrong.

Rong Yiren said, in short, Zhang Naiqi sells capitalist private goods under the cover of some Marxist-Leninist terms; he uses the negative side of industrialists and businessmen and sweet words to deceive the industrial and commercial circles to follow him to the capitalist dead end; and he uses his high position to expand his personal influence. All these are unfavorable to our industrial and commercial circles. We have the responsibility to loudly appeal and tell industrialists and businessmen across the country not to follow him to the capitalist dead end. We must conduct a serious struggle against his anti-socialist remarks!

At the end of the meeting, the executive chairman of the meeting, Li Zhuchen, spoke. He reminded everyone to pay attention to the fact that Zhang Naiqi said several times that the industrialists and businessmen are now advanced, and the dogmatists are backward. The dogmatists here refer to the working class. He also said that the difference between leadership and being led is the difference between advanced and backward. The essence of these words is that industrialists and businessmen can lead the working class, and the bourgeoisie can be restored.

Li Zhuchen said that this joint meeting to criticize Zhang Naiqi's remarks has come to a temporary end, but the criticism of Zhang Naiqi is only the beginning and is not deep enough. We will continue to criticize him in the future.

### 民建中央和全国工商联通过联合指示  立即对章乃器的反动活动展开斗争

　　民建中央和全国工商联通过联合指示
　　立即对章乃器的反动活动展开斗争
    据新华社19日讯　中国民主建国会中央常委会和全国工商联常委会联席会议经过四次会议的讨论，今天通过一项联合指示，号召全国工商业者和民主建国会会员立即对章乃器的反社会主义言论展开坚决斗争，并且对章乃器作出组织处分。
    联席会议今天宣布，有北京、天津、重庆、广州、武汉、四川、吉林、陕西、广西、河南等十八个省、市地区的民建和工商联地方组织来信来电，对章乃器的反动言论表示愤慨，要求给他以组织处分。在今天的会议过程中，这样的信电和长途电话还频频传来。民主建国会中央常委会和全国工商联常委会根据各地方组织的要求，给章乃器以“停止会内全部职务，责令检讨”的处分，到会的三十四位民建中央常委和到会的四十五位全国工商联常委一致举手通过。
    千家驹、荣毅仁、黄玠然等人今天下午又对章乃器的言论作了批判。章乃器没有出席今天的会议。
    中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会关于“全国工商业者团结起来、立即展开对章乃器的反社会主义的活动作坚决的斗争的联合指示”中说，近两个月来，我们工商业者和各界人民一样，认真地发表了自己的意见，积极地帮助党整风。但是，右派分子利用了这个机会，以帮助党整风作为幌子，恶毒地展开了反对党、反对工人阶级和破坏社会主义事业的活动，章乃器就是右派分子的突出的代表。
    指示中说，章乃器的反社会主义由来已久，过去不断地利用机会散播他的政治毒素。去年冬季民建会举行二中全会时，同志们曾对他进行了严肃的批判。最近期间，章乃器利用帮助党整风的机会，又发表了一系列的反社会主义的荒谬言论，造成了极恶劣的影响。我们两会常务委员会为了击退右派分子对社会主义的进攻，特召开了联席会议，对章乃器进行了严肃的批判，帮助他改正错误，但是他在会议中，不仅不接受同志们的善意的反复耐心的帮助，反而继续对工商界进行挑拨煽动，坚持他的反社会主义的活动。我们两会不得不及时采取措施，以粉碎章乃器的反动的政治行为。
    章乃器的反动的政治行为，就是反对工人阶级和中国共产党的领导，反对我国人民建设社会主义、走社会主义的道路。他无耻地宣传红色资产阶级的论调，鼓吹资产阶级分子和工人之间已经没有本质区别，资产阶级已经没有两面性，如同工人阶级一样，只有先进与落后的差别。这种混淆阶级区别的说法，在实质上，就是否认工人阶级的领导。他歪曲斯大林对于共产党员品质的说法，甚至于把共产党员比作政治骗子李万铭，这种丑化共产党员的阴险手法，在实质上就是要动摇中国共产党的领导。他把社会主义制度下的工作缺点和错误夸大为社会主义制度本身的毛病，使人们觉得社会主义好像就是官僚主义，他把官僚主义说成是比资本主义更危险的敌人这更是赤裸裸地诽谤社会主义，露骨地宣传资本主义复辟。
    指示中说，章乃器为了达到他的反社会主义的政治目的，他对工商界用尽了歪曲、挑拨、煽动、欺骗、麻醉等等一切无耻的手段。第一，他断章取义，歪曲毛主席的话，来玩弄他的鱼目混珠，以假乱真的手法。第二，他利用工商业者思想认识上的弱点，来进行恐吓煽动，捏造别人说社会主义改造高潮后资产阶级的两面性现在还是政治上的反革命和经济上的五毒，把工商业者的“脱胎换骨”的本质改造，说成“抽筋剥皮”，企图煽动起工商业者对党和政府的不满情绪。第三，他以体贴工商业者感情，发挥工商业者积极性为幌子，对工商业者进行恶毒的麻醉欺骗，他说工商业者现在已经没有剥削，定息也不是剥削；他说资产阶级不经过改造也能爱社会主义，而且带了生产资料进社会主义，比那些赤手空拳喊口号、贴标语的人还光荣，在实质上是要工商业者看不到自己还存在的资本主义的消极一面，放松进一步的思想改造。第四，更恶劣的，他在反教条主义的幌子下，以修正主义来攻击马克思列宁主义，以资产阶级思想来反对工人阶级思想，把同他的论调相反的论点和思想，一概扣上教条主义、形而上学、唯成份论等等帽子。章乃器的这种阴险恶毒的手法是一贯的，而最近则是变本加厉了。
    由此可见，章乃器的一系列的荒谬言论已经不是一种思想问题，更不是一种理论上的争论问题，而是一种反动的政治行动问题。这是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争。
    指示中说，全国工商业者的最大的利益和最长远的利益，是平平稳稳地走过过渡时期的道路，把自己改变为名副其实的劳动者。几年来我们接受社会主义改造，基本上改变了生产资料的所有制，走上了社会主义道路，但是，应当看到，我们工商业者还没有脱离剥削者的根子，阶级两面性还存在。因此，现在摆在我们每一个人面前的重要问题，是进一步改造我们的资产阶级的思想，逐步改变我们的立场、观点和方法，使我们能够在社会主义道路上以更坚定的步伐向前迈进。根据毛主席所指示的有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争的精神，我们两会的各级组织，必须立即组织和领导当地会员和工商业者，展开对章乃器反社会主义活动的坚决的斗争。在同章乃器反社会主义活动进行斗争的时候，应当注意：要同右派分子划清思想上和行动上的界限，考验自己，锻炼自己，站稳立场。要向全体会员和工商业者很好地说明，章乃器的反动活动的性质，和工商业者一般的思想错误或者认识不清，是完全不相同的。我们根据知无不言，言无不尽的精神，对一切缺点和错误都应该提出批评，即使有些话说得不正确，或者对于有些问题还没有正确的认识，都是人民内部的一般思想问题，都可以采用团结——批评——团结的方法来处理。
　　千家驹、荣毅仁、李烛尘等继续批判章乃器
    章乃器是在用甜言蜜语
    欺骗工商业者走资本主义死路
    在今天的会议上，千家驹代表孙晓村、吴大琨、冯和法和他本人在会上作了长篇的联合发言。这个联合发言对章乃器的反社会主义的谬论作了深刻的分析和反驳。千家驹的发言着重指出章乃器的思想根源是资产阶级两面性的消极一面；它的具体表现就是在他对阶级关系、两面性、赎买政策、工商业者的进一步改造以及社会主义制度等问题的看法上。而这些看法已经不再是属于理论探讨的范畴，而是政治路线问题。他说：我们与章乃器之间所展开的斗争实质上是两条路线的斗争。
    荣毅仁在发言中首先汇报了上海市工商界批判章乃器错误言论的情况，他说明近几天来民建上海市委员会和上海市工商业联合会已经分别或联合召开了一系列会议，批判章乃器的反社会主义谬论。会上一致认为章乃器的言论是糖衣毒药，是资产阶级消极面的集中表现，并认为对章乃器的批判是社会主义和资本主义两条路线的斗争。荣毅仁说，上海工商界对章乃器的批判还仅仅是开始，以后还要继续深入下去。他还反映了上海工商界要求民建中央和全国工商联对章乃器这种散布荒谬言论，危害社会主义改造事业的严重错误，迅速进行组织上的处理。
    荣毅仁接着谈到他对章乃器发表的错误谬论中几个问题的看法。他说他从一个工商业者的角度来谈谈这些问题。首先关于定息是不是剥削的问题，荣毅仁说：自从实行定息以后，我思想上曾经有些疙瘩，我想过去资本家掌握生产资料，占有工人创造的剩余价值，那是剥削，现在情况变了，工人阶级给资本家定息，是不是剥削呢？我请教过一些同志，现在我认为工商业者与生产资料的关系还没有完全割断，如果说是完全割断了，定息从那里来呢？从这里看出定息还是一种剥削。工人阶级因为我们愿意走社会主义的道路，也为了使我们工商业者更好地接受改造，因此在一定时期内容忍我们的剥削，但是李康年提出要定息二十年，工人就起来反对了。因此不能因为工人阶级容忍剥削，就否认定息是剥削。
    荣毅仁说：章乃器说两面性是先进与落后的问题，我认为既然定息是剥削，那么剥削就是资产阶级消极的一面，只是情况和以前不同了，资本主义时期是无限制的剥削，现在是有限制的剥削。在工作中思想上也已经有许多事实说明资产阶级消极性是存在的，例如有些人一方面要求摘掉资产阶级帽子，一方面要定息二十年，这不是十足的资本主义思想吗？有些人在工作上要求对他们信任，要一视同仁，而在生活、安排上要求特殊照顾，这不也是消极性的表现吗？在这样的情况下是否可以说工商业者主要是自卑和畏缩呢？是否可以说工商业者没有个人主义自私自利与工人阶级完全一样了呢？工人阶级中也有先进和落后，但是工人阶级中并没有依靠生产资料来进行剥削的人。从这里看出工人阶级内的先进与落后和资产阶级的两面性是有本质的区别。
    荣毅仁说：章乃器利用工商业者的弱点，极尽麻醉、挑拨之能事。如工商业者怕提到“剥削”，他就说定息不是剥削，使工商界认识模糊。章乃器又强调现在只要谈共事关系，不要谈阶级关系，资产阶级没有两面性等等，这样说似乎工商业者就可以不要改造了，这就是要把我们拉回到资本主义的老路上去，这和我们工商业者要走社会主义道路的愿望是完全违背的。如果资产阶级要走资本主义道路，全国工人、农民和劳动人民都会坚决反对，这是工商业者的绝路。
    荣毅仁还批判了章乃器所说的官僚主义比资本主义更危险的谬论。他说，章乃器的这句话充分地暴露了他对资本主义的爱护和留恋。官僚主义是工作中存在的问题，是人民内部的事情，而资本主义是和社会主义相敌对的一种制度，照章乃器的说法，难道人民内部问题比敌对的问题更危险吗？这样就混淆了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区别，是极端错误的。
    荣毅仁说，总之章乃器在一些马列主义的名词掩盖下来贩卖资本主义的私货；他利用工商业者消极的一面，用甜言蜜语来欺骗工商界跟他走到资本主义死路上去；又利用自己的高级职位来扩大个人的影响；这些都是不利于我们工商界的。我们有责任大声疾呼，告诉全国工商业者不要跟他走到资本主义的死路上去，我们要对他的反社会主义言论进行严肃的斗争！
    在会议结束的时候，会议执行主席李烛尘发言。他提醒大家注意，章乃器几次说现在工商业者先进了，教条主义者落后了，这里的教条主义者就是指的工人阶级，又说领导与被领导的区别就是先进与落后的区别。这些话的实质就是说工商业者可以领导工人阶级，资产阶级可以复辟了。
    李烛尘说，这次批判章乃器言论的联席会议暂时告一段落，但是对章乃器的批判仅仅是开始，还不够深入，以后还要继续批判。
