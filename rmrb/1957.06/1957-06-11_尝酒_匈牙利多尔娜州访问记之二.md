　　Wine Tasting
　　——A Visit to Dolna County, Hungary (Part 2)——
　　Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    Braving the drizzle, we came to the outskirts of Szekszárd to visit one of the oldest wine cellars, built more than 500 years ago. The Turks occupied this area for 150 years. During that time, the Turkish occupiers levied heavy taxes on the farmers of Dolna County. Every year, on a certain day, the farmers would carry wine barrels in long lines to pay the wine they had brewed to the Turks. The occupiers first stored the wine delivered by the farmers in this cellar, and then transported it back to Turkey by sailing ships on the Danube River. After the Turks were driven away, this cellar became the property of the Hungarian landlords, and the peasants continued to pay wine taxes as before. After liberation, this cellar was not used for a long time. It was not until five years ago, after renovation, that it became the wine cellar of the Kőmáti State Winery. The wine stored here is Szekszárd's famous wine, mainly used for export.
    Inside the cellar are many circular tunnels, lined with rows of large round barrels. The large barrels can hold more than 1,700 liters of wine. Each barrel of wine has a different nature, with different names and different vintages. After walking through several tunnels, the owner of the cellar, Uncle Pista, invited us to sit on a long bench and taste their famous wines. Several wine glasses had already been placed on a long, narrow table. His assistant took a bottle with a thin glass tube and drew a bottle of light yellow wine from the first large barrel. After tasting this yellow wine, we tasted the second type of yellow wine, and after drinking the yellow wine, we tasted various different red wines.
    Szekszárd's red wine is world-renowned. It has won first prize domestically and third prize at world exhibitions. A wine called "Jesus' Tears" has a slightly sour taste and is also a valuable wine in Italy. Another wine called "Bull's Blood" has a very beautiful color, like a solution of rubies or the nectar of red roses, with a sweet and delicious taste. A young poet from the area who accompanied us on the tour said that many praises of Szekszárd red wine are circulating among the people. After the musician Liszt came to Szekszárd and tasted the red wine, he returned to Vienna and recommended it to his friends everywhere. The people here sing: "Hungarians! When you drink Szekszárd red wine, you will become brave!" "Szekszárd red wine is better than Ganoderma lucidum, whoever drinks a sip of it will live forever!"
    Young writer Samosh said: "Do you know why we Hungarians love to drink so much? Because wine reflects the people's distress, sorrow, joy, and love. For wine, people can pawn their last pair of pants; for friendship, they will give everything they have."
    I said: "What you said reminds me of Petőfi's poem 'A Tavern at the End of the Village'."
    So they, together with the driver István, immediately recited in unison:
    "A tavern at the end of the village,
    Near the Szamos River," (The Szamos River is a tributary of the Tisza River)
    I said: "A small correction should be added here. Our wine cellar is near the Sió River, a tributary of the Danube River."
    "Yes, yes!" They agreed with me and continued to recite:
    "Hey, landlady, precious flower!
    Quickly bring the good wine,
    That wine, older than grandfather,
    And as passionate as a lover!
    ……………………………”
    The young poet who accompanied us said: "For Petőfi's immortal poem, let us drink this glass of red wine!" The host, Pista, said: "Red wine is also the wine of blood oath. The ancestors of the Hungarians were nomadic people. After settling here, the chiefs often drank wine to form alliances. The ritual of the alliance was to cut each other's wrists and drip blood into the red wine, and drink it all." Samosh grabbed and said: "Today, for the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, let us drink this glass of blood oath red wine!" The old man said: "Yes, yes, that's exactly what I wanted to say."
    István said with great interest: "For the old man's wonderful initiative, we should have another drink!"
    The wine pourer was also preparing to climb up other barrels to draw wine. I said: "Other wines can be skipped, I have found the most beautiful one, which is 'Bull's Blood'." Samosh picked up the glass and said to everyone: "Saint John!" (i.e., the idiom for the last glass) The host also instructed the wine pourer to fill a large bottle of red wine for us, hoping that we would drink it when we were happiest, and come back to fill the bottle when we finished drinking it.
    We bid farewell to Uncle Pista and his assistant. They stood at the entrance of the cellar, above the eaves of which was the vineyard. Today is their holiday, and they specially rushed from home to open this cellar to welcome us. They also said that when the grapes are ripe, it is a grand festival here. They invited us to come here again at that time, and everyone will meet again at that time!

　　尝酒
　　——匈牙利多尔娜州访问记之二——
　　本报记者  胡济邦
    冒着细雨，我们来到塞克萨特的近郊参观一个最古老的酒窖，这个大地窖是在五百多年前造成的。土耳其人在此地占领过一百五十年之久，当时土耳其的占领者向多尔娜州的农民征收重税，农民每年到一定的日子，就扛着酒桶，排成长队，向土耳其人缴纳自己酿成的葡萄酒。占领者把农民交来的酒先贮存在这个地窖里，然后再用多瑙河的帆船运回土耳其去。土耳其人被赶走以后，这个地窖就为匈牙利的地主所有，农民还是照样缴纳酒税。解放后，这个酒窖很长一个时期没有用过。直到五年前经过修建后，就成为科伊马蒂国营酿酒农场的酒窖。这里存放的酒是塞克萨特的名酒，主要都用来运销国外的。
    酒窖里面有许多圆形的隧道，陈列着成排的大圆桶，大号圆桶可容一千七百多立特的酒。每桶酒的性质都不相同，有不同的名称，有不同的年份。我们走完几条隧道以后，酒窖的主人彼什多老伯，请我们在一条长板凳上坐下，尝饮他们的名酒。在一张狭长的桌子上，已摆着几只酒杯。他的助手拿着一个带有细长玻璃管的瓶子，从第一个大桶里吸出了一瓶浅黄色的酒。我们尝了这种黄酒后，又尝第二种黄酒，喝完黄酒又尝了各种不同的红酒。
    塞克萨特的葡萄红酒是世界闻名的，它在国内得过第一奖，在世界展览会上得过第三奖。一种叫做“耶稣泪”的酒，带有一点酸味，这种酒在意大利也是名贵的酒。另一种叫做“牛血”，颜色非常美丽，好像红宝石的溶液，又像红玫瑰的甘露，味道清甜可口。陪同我们一起参观的当地的一位青年诗人说，在民间流传着许多关于塞克萨特红酒的赞颂。音乐家李斯特来到塞克萨特尝过红酒以后，他回到维也纳就到处向友人推荐。此地的人们这样唱着：“匈牙利人啊！当你喝了塞克萨特的红酒，你就会勇敢起来！”“塞克萨特的红酒比灵芝草还好，谁要喝它一口，就会长生不老！”
    青年作家沙莫什说：“你知道我们匈牙利人为什么这样爱好喝酒？因为酒里面反映出人民的苦闷、忧愁、快乐和爱情，人们为了酒，可以把最后一条裤头拿去当掉；为了友谊，他也会献出他所有的一切。”
    我说：“你们谈到这里，使我想起裴多菲的诗篇‘村子尽头的一家酒店’。”
    于是他们连同司机伊士特万一起，马上就齐声朗诵起来：
    “村子尽头的一家酒店，
    靠近撒莫什河边，”（撒莫什河是蒂萨河的支流）
    我说：“这里应加上一点小小的修正，我们的这个酒窖是靠近多瑙河的支流西游河边。”
    “对，对”！他们一面答应着我，一面又继续朗诵下去：
    “嘿，老板娘，宝贵的花！
    你快把好酒拿来，
    那酒，要比祖父更老，
    也要像爱人一样热烈！
    ……………………………”
    陪我们来的青年诗人说：“为了裴多菲的不朽的诗篇，让我们干这一杯红酒吧！”主人彼什多说：“红酒又是血盟的酒，匈牙利人的祖宗是游牧民族，定居此地以后，酋长之间常常饮酒结盟。结盟的仪式是彼此割破手腕，把血滴在红酒中，交杯饮尽。”沙莫什抢着说：“今天为中匈人民的友谊，我们饮完这杯血盟的红酒！”老伯说：“对，对，我要说的正是这个意思。”
    伊士特万兴致勃勃地说：“为了老伯这个美妙的创议，我们应该再干一杯呀！”
    斟酒的人还准备爬上其他的酒桶去吸酒。我说：“其他的酒可以不尝了，我已找到最美的一种，就是‘牛血’。”沙莫什拿起杯子来向大家说：“圣约翰！”（即最后一杯的俗语）主人还吩咐斟酒人灌了满满一大瓶红酒送给我们，希望我们在最快乐的时候喝它，喝完了再来把酒瓶灌满。
    我们向彼什多老伯和他的助手告别，他们站在地窖的门口，那门檐上面就是葡萄园。今天是他们的假日，特地从家里赶来打开这个地窖欢迎我们。他们还说，葡萄熟了的时候是此地的盛大的节日，那时候请我们再来此地，大家那时候再见面吧！
