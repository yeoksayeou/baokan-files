Do you know how many pigs there are in the country right now?
　　The number will reach 105 million by the end of this month, exceeding the highest level of pig production in China.
　　(Our reporter Li Gendi reports) Pig production in China is developing rapidly. In the first quarter of this year, there were 97 million pigs in the country. It is estimated that by the end of this month, the number will reach 105 million, which is more than 3 million more than in 1954, the year with the highest number of pigs raised after liberation.
　　Before liberation, the year with the highest number of pigs raised in China was 1934, with 78.53 million pigs nationwide. At the time of liberation, the number of pigs in the country had dropped to 57.75 million. In 1952, the highest production level before liberation was reached for the first time, exceeding it by 11.34 million. 1954 was the year with the highest pig production in China's history, with a total of 101 million pigs nationwide. From the second half of 1954 to the first half of 1956, the total number of pigs in the country gradually decreased to 84 million, which was 17 million less than in the first half of 1954; but still 5.47 million more than in 1934.
　　In the second half of 1956, the Party and the People's Government began to vigorously reverse the decline in pig production. Specific measures to solve the feed problem were stipulated, prices were adjusted and the procurement system was improved, and the policy of "public ownership, private raising, and public assistance" was clarified; and extensive organizational work and social propaganda were carried out. Since then, a pig-raising competition involving thousands of villages and households has been launched in rural areas. The current characteristics of pig development are: although the number of breeding sows is increasing rapidly, it still cannot keep up with the needs of pig production development.

　　你知道目前全国有多少生猪？
　　本月末将发展到一亿零五百万头
    突破我国生猪生产的最高水平
    本报讯　本报记者李根蒂报道：我国生猪生产正在迅速发展中。今年第一季度全国有生猪九千七百万头，预计本月末将发展到一亿零五百万头，即比解放后养猪最多的1954年还多三百多万头。
    解放前，我国养猪最多的年份是1934年，全国有生猪七千八百五十三万头。解放时全国生猪数已降低到五千七百七十五万头。1952年，第一次赶上解放前最高生产水平，并且超过了一千一百三十四万头。1954年是我国历史上生猪生产的最高年份，全国共有生猪一亿零一百万头。从1954年下半年开始，到1956年上半年全国生猪总数逐渐下降到八千四百万头。即比1954年上半年减少了一千七百万头；但比1934年仍多五百四十七万头。
    1956年下半年，党和人民政府着手大力扭转生猪生产的下降局面。规定了解决饲料的具体办法，调整了价格并改进收购制度，明确“公有、私养、公助”的方针；并且展开了广泛的组织工作和社会宣传。至此，农村中掀起了千村万户的养猪竞赛。目前生猪发展中的特点是：繁殖猪籽虽在迅速增加，但仍赶不上生猪生产发展的需要。
