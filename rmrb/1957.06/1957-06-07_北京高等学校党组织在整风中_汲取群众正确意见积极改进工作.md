Beijing, June 6 (By our reporter) Since May 10th, the Party organizations of thirty universities and colleges in Beijing have been concentrating their efforts on mobilizing non-Party masses to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the Party organizations and to help rectify the Party. The Party committees of various schools have successively solicited opinions from various democratic parties and non-party teachers and staff in the school through various methods such as symposiums and individual interviews. In schools where the rectification movement has developed more rapidly, the non-Party masses have largely completed offering opinions to the Party, and the school Party committees are analyzing and studying the issues raised by the masses. They are starting to comprehensively consider and arrange plans for inspection and improvement; schools where the opinions of the masses have not been fully expressed are continuing to develop criticism; a small number of school Party committees, because they do not fully understand the spirit of the central instructions and their thinking lags behind the movement, are now also letting go and mobilizing the masses to carry out criticism.

Although the speed and depth of the rectification movement in various schools are different, through the criticism of the masses, the Party committees and all Party members in each school have received profound education, and the ideological level of the Party members has been improved. The Party committees of various schools have seriously dealt with the criticisms and opinions put forward by the masses and implemented the spirit of "inspecting and improving simultaneously."

From the members of the Party committees of various schools to every Party member, their understanding of the seriousness of their own mistakes before the movement was insufficient. After being criticized by the masses, they became vigilant. For example, some Party committee comrades of the Institute of Technology, Agricultural University, and Aviation Institute received unreasonably large welfare subsidies last year. After the masses criticized them, they decided to return the money to the public for disposal. Some Party members of the Aviation Institute, Agricultural University, Peking University and other institutions felt that their salary grades were rated too high, so they voluntarily submitted their opinions to the Party organization, requesting consideration for lowering them.

The comrades of the Tsinghua University Party Committee used to have preferential treatment certificates for shopping on campus and enjoyed special rights. This time, they also announced the cancellation.

In terms of work, some specific problems, large and small, could have been resolved within the school in a timely manner, but they were not resolved due to bureaucraticism in leadership. After these problems were raised, some of them have been resolved in a timely manner. For example, some non-Party department heads in Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools were unable to fully play their roles in the past because they had no real power. Now, the school leaders have handed over to them the independent responsibility for the teaching and administrative work of each department, giving them both position and power.

In the past, some confidentiality systems were inappropriate, affecting teaching and scientific research. For example, Peking University used to prohibit professors in some departments from purchasing books and periodicals from capitalist countries; the personnel department did not introduce the assistants’ situations to the teachers when assigning assistants to teachers; the Institute of Technology used to stipulate that teachers from non-professional departments could not go to internship factories, and teaching materials were stored in one place and not allowed to be used by teachers. After these problems were raised, each school made realistic revisions to the relevant confidentiality system according to the needs of teaching and scientific research. The Aviation Institute arranged non-Party professors who were researching specialized subjects to teach basic courses in the past. After the professors raised their opinions, the school also considered adjusting their work based on the current teaching situation of the school and their personal opinions.

Some school Party committees, in receiving mass talks and in symposiums, found problems that could be solved and solved them specifically on the spot, without dragging the problems down. At a symposium, employees of the Aviation Institute criticized the Party committee for not arranging political classes for them. Wu Guang, the Party Committee Secretary and President, immediately accepted the criticism and discussed with the employees ways to solve the problem.

In past movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, some people were wrongly criticized or their feelings were hurt because the method of ideological criticism was inappropriate. The school Party committees also organized special personnel to rehabilitate and deal with the aftermath of these issues.

For major issues involving the academic system and curriculum that cannot be resolved within the school, such as those in Peking University, the school also designated special personnel to study and strive to put forward concrete opinions for solving the problems within a certain period, and submit them to the Ministry of Higher Education for research and resolution.

Because some of the issues raised by the vast number of non-Party masses have been dealt with in a timely manner, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been gradually improved, and the enthusiasm of the masses to help the Party rectify its style has been further stimulated. In order to further help the Party analyze and study problems, distinguish right from wrong, and seek ways to improve work, the non-Party masses of many schools are continuing to carry out criticism and discuss the issues that everyone has raised.

    北京高等学校党组织在整风中
    汲取群众正确意见积极改进工作
    本报讯　北京三十所高等学校的党组织，自5月10日开展整风运动以来，都集中力量发动党外群众对党组织的缺点和错误，展开批评，帮助整风。各校党委先后曾通过座谈会、个别接谈等各种方式，广泛征求校内各民主党派及无党派的教职员的意见。运动发展较快的学校，党外群众对党提意见已大体上告一段落，学校党委正在进行分析研究群众所提出的问题。开始全盘考虑检查和安排改进工作的方案；群众的意见还未得到充分发表的学校，正在继续开展批评；有少数学校党委，因为对中央指示的精神领会不够，思想落后于运动，现在也正在放手发动群众开展批评。
    各校整风运动发展的速度和深度虽不同，但通过群众的批评，对各校党委以及全体党员来说，都受到深刻的教育，党员的思想水平有了提高。各校党委对群众所提出的批评和意见，认真地进行处理，贯彻“边检查，边改进”的精神。
    从各校党委委员直到每个党员，在运动前对自己错误的严重性认识不足，这次经群众批评后，就引起了警惕。如工业学院、农业大学和航空学院有些党委同志，去年领的福利补助费不够合理，群众一提出批评，他们就决定把这笔钱退还给公家处理。航空学院、农业大学、北京大学等院校有些党员，感到自己的工资级别被评定得偏高了，就自动地向党组织提出意见，要求考虑降低。
    清华大学党委同志，过去在校内购物等方面，发有优待证，享受有特殊权利，这次，他们也宣布取消。
    在工作方面，过去有些大大小小的具体问题，本来是能够在学校内部及时解决的，但因为领导上的官僚主义，未能得到解决。这些问题提出来后，有的已及时地加以解决。如北京大学、清华大学等校有些党外系主任，过去因为有职无权，没能充分发挥作用。现在，学校领导上就交由他们独立负责各系的教学行政工作，使他们有职有权。
    过去有些保密制度不恰当，影响到教学和科学研究。如北京大学过去有些系不许教授购置资本主义国家的书刊；人事部门为教师配备助手不向教师介绍关于助手，的情况；工业学院过去规定非专业系的教师不能下实习工厂，教学资料保存在一处不让教师使用。这些问题提出来以后，各校即根据教学及科学研究的需要，对有关保密制度作了实事求是的修改。航空学院把过去研究专业的党外教授安排去教基础课，自教授们提出意见后，也根据当前学校教学的情况和个人的意见，考虑调整他们的工作。
    有的学校党委，在接待群众谈话和在座谈会上，发现能够解决的问题，就当场加以具体的解决，不把问题拖下来。航空学院职工在座谈会上批评党委没为他们安排政治课，党委书记、院长武光，当场就接受批评，并和职工共同讨论解决这个问题的办法。
    在过去的肃反等运动中，有些人被斗错或是因为思想批判的方式不恰当，伤害了感情。学校党委对这些问题，也都组织专人，进行平反和善后工作。
    北京大学等校，对于牵涉到学制课程等在校内不能够解决的重大问题，也都指定专人研究，争取在一定的时期内，提出解决问题的具体意见，提交高教部研究解决。
    由于广大党外群众在运动中所提出的问题，有的已经得到及时的处理，这样就逐步改善了党群关系，并更加激发了群众帮助党整风的热情。很多学校的党外群众，为了进一步帮助党分析研究问题，辨明是非，寻求改进工作的途径，正在继续展开批评，讨论大家已提出来的问题。
