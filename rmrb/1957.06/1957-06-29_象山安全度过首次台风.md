Xinhua News Agency, Xiangshan, June 28th. Xiangshan County in Zhejiang Province, which suffered from a particularly strong typhoon last year, safely weathered its first typhoon of this year on the 27th. This typhoon began at 8:00 PM on the 26th and gradually weakened at 8:00 AM on the 27th, lasting twelve hours, with the strongest winds reaching level eight.

During the typhoon, the tsunami was fierce, with roaring waves pounding the shore. Maritime traffic from Xiangshan to Ningbo, Zhoushan, and other places was cut off for three days, and deep-sea and coastal fisheries also ceased production.

Reporters learned from the Xiangshan County Typhoon Prevention Headquarters that all seawalls in the county remained intact without any breaches. There was no damage to agriculture or fisheries. Only over 2,000 mu of low-lying fields along the coast of Xinqitou Village in Nanzhuang District were flooded by mountain floods, but the water can be drained within one or two days.

　　象山安全度过首次台风
    新华社象山28日电　去年曾受过特强台风袭击成灾的浙江省象山县，27日安全度过了今年第一次台风袭击。这次台风由26日下午八时开始，到27日晨八时逐渐减弱，历时十二小时，最强风力达到八级。
    这次台风来时，海啸甚凶，惊涛拍岸，气势磅礴，象山到宁波舟山等处的海上交通断绝了三天，远洋和近海渔业也都停止了生产。
    记者从象山县防风指挥部获悉，全县所有海塘无一损溃，农业和渔业也都没有损失，仅南庄区新碶头村沿海有二千多亩低田遭山洪水淹，一二日内即可排涝出险。
