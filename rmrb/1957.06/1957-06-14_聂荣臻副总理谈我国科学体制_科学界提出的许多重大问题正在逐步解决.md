Xinhua News Agency, June 13th. The fourth enlarged meeting of the State Council's Science Planning Commission began today in Beijing. Commission Director Nie Rongzhen spoke at the meeting. He said: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have already solved or are gradually solving many major problems reflected by the scientific community.

In his speech, Nie Rongzhen said that the government is systematically and gradually solving the problem of scientific research working conditions as an important issue. Regarding the supply of research materials, the scope of confidentiality was too large in the past, and this should be reasonably changed in the future. Over the past year, the research time of most scientific workers has generally been guaranteed, but the time problem has not been well resolved for a few scientists who hold leadership positions or participate in too many social activities. Some scientists must participate in discussions of important issues and necessary social activities because they are responsible for certain leadership work, but it is also necessary and possible to reduce some unnecessary concurrent jobs and social activities. This issue can be arranged by the scientists themselves who hold too many concurrent jobs and participate in too many social activities, and they can make suggestions, and the leadership organs should give sympathetic support.

Nie Rongzhen said that certain financial systems that are unfavorable to scientific work should be changed.

Nie Rongzhen said that the fundamental solution to the problem of scientific instruments and chemical reagents is to develop production, which requires the efforts of relevant industrial departments, as well as the strong support of research institutions, universities, and scientists. In recent years, the state has paid a large amount of funds and foreign exchange for books. Last year alone, the foreign exchange spent on purchasing books and periodicals from capitalist countries was 1.8 million pounds, and this year it is 1.5 million pounds. He pointed out that the distribution and use of these books are not satisfactory.

Regarding the scientific system issue, which once caused controversy in the scientific community, Nie Rongzhen said: After extensively soliciting opinions from all parties, a consensus has been reached: the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the national academic leader and key research center; universities, research institutions of various central industrial departments (including factory and mining laboratories), and research institutions under local authorities are the broad base of scientific research in our country; the state must actively support the key tasks undertaken by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, so that it can truly take on the task of breaking through positions and opening up new fields in several major departments of science, but it is not necessary to transfer all the more accomplished experts in the country to the Academy of Sciences; scientific research in universities must be actively promoted, and neither teaching nor scientific research should be neglected; universities should strive to gradually become the center or one of the centers of national scientific research in certain or one scientific field; the scientific research institutions of various central industrial departments must be greatly strengthened, so that they can combine with production needs, solve more specialized problems, apply new scientific achievements to production, and conduct scientific summaries based on new experiences in production to develop and enrich scientific theory; localities should closely combine with the needs of economic and cultural construction that can be organized in the region to carry out research work, and should also carry out some research work that is not directly needed locally, in order to give full play to the role of scientists in the region.

When talking about this year's scientific research plan, Nie Rongzhen said: Making an annual plan for national scientific and technological research is a new issue, just like the long-term plan. From practical experience, it is necessary and possible to make arrangements for national scientific and technological research work once a year based on the long-term plan and the actual requirements of various departments. Scientists are still free to choose topics as long as it is possible, even if they cannot be included in the national plan.

Zhou Yang, member of the Science Planning Commission and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a speech on issues of philosophy and social sciences.

Fan Changjiang, Secretary-General of the Commission, explained the compilation of this year's scientific and technological research plan.

　　聂荣臻副总理谈我国科学体制
　　科学界提出的许多重大问题正在逐步解决
    新华社13日讯　国务院科学规划委员会第四次扩大会议今天起在北京举行。委员会主任聂荣臻在会上讲了话。他说：中共中央和国务院对科学界反映出来的许多重大问题已经或正在逐步解决。
    聂荣臻在他的讲话中说，政府正在把科学研究工作条件问题作为重要问题来系统地、逐步地解决。关于研究资料的供应问题，过去由于保密范围过大，今后应该合理改变。一年多来，大部分科学工作者的研究，时间一般是有保证的，但少数担任领导工作的或社会活动过多的科学家，时间问题还没有很好解决。有些科学家因为负责了一定的领导工作，有些重大问题的讨论和必要的社会活动是必须参加的，但减少一些不必要的兼职和社会活动，也是必要和可能的，这个问题可以由兼职过多和社会活动过多的科学家们自己来安排，提出建议，各领导机关应予同情的支持。
    聂荣臻说，应改变某些不利于科学工作的财务制度。
    聂荣臻说，解决科学仪器和化学试剂问题，根本之道是发展生产，这需要有关工业部门的努力，也需要研究机构、高等学校和科学家们以大力支持。几年来国家在图书方面支付了大量的经费和外汇，去年仅购买资本主义国家的书刊所支出的外汇就有一百八十万镑，今年是一百五十万镑。他指出这些图书的分配、使用情况是不能令人满意的。
    关于曾经在科学界引起争论的科学体制问题，聂荣臻说：广泛地征求了各方面的意见以后，大体上取得了一致的认识：中国科学院是全国学术领导和重点研究中心，高等学校、中央各产业部门的研究机构（包括厂矿实验室）和地方所属研究机构，是我国科学研究的广阔基地；国家必须在中国科学院所负担的重点任务上，积极支持，使它在科学的若干主要的部门内，真正担当起突破阵地、开拓新领域的任务，但并非全国较有成就的专家都要调到科学院来；高等学校的科学研究必须积极提倡，教学和科学研究，两者不可偏废，高等学校应该努力使自己在某几门和某一门科学领域内逐步成为全国科学研究的中心或中心之一；中央各产业部门的科学研究机构必须大力加强，使它们能结合生产需要，解决较专门的问题，使科学的新成果引用到生产中去，并根据生产中的新经验，进行科学的总结，来发展和丰富科学理论；地方应该密切结合本地区可能组织的经济建设和文化建设的需要开展研究工作，同时也应该进行一些不是本地直接需要的研究工作，以充分发挥本地区科学家的作用。
    聂荣臻在谈到今年科学研究计划时说：作全国性的科学技术研究的年度计划和长期规划一样，是一个新问题，从实践的经验看，对全国的科学技术研究工作，在远景规划和各部门现实要求的基础上每年作一次安排是必要的，也是可能的。凡不能列入国家计划的，只要有可能，科学家仍有选择题目的自由。
    科学规划委员会委员、中共中央宣传部副部长周扬就哲学社会科学问题作了发言。
    委员会秘书长范长江对编制今年科学技术研究计划作了说明。
