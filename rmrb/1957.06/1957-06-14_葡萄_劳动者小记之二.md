　　Grapes
　　——Notes of a Laborer, No. 2
　　Wang Ming

    We have a grape trellis in our small courtyard. In a few more days, the winding vines will cover every beam and post, and the broad leaves will spread out on every vine. At that time, the grape trellis will be like a verdant canopy, supporting itself in the courtyard. In the morning, dewdrops lie quietly on the leaves, so crystal clear and lovely that you simply can't bear to touch them. If you look up through the gaps in this canopy, you'll see one or two small stars in a patch of rose-colored clouds, struggling not to leave. In the evening, it’s even more interesting. People sit under the canopy, enjoying the cool air, drinking tea, and chatting. At this time, adults tell stories to the children, asking them to look up at the sky, and then I hear the fairy tales repeated to people a thousand times. The adults tell the children not to make a sound and see if they can hear the Weaving Maid crying... The grape trellis brings us many benefits, and we all like it from the bottom of our hearts.

    This grape trellis was cultivated single-handedly by Old Sun, our civil servant. Old Sun is over fifty years old, but he is strong and full of vigor. If you didn't know him, judging from his back, with his broad shoulders, tall stature, and straight spine, you would certainly think he was a robust middle-aged man. He has been working here for eight years. Every morning, he sweeps the yard, waters the flowers, and trims the grape trellis. Every night, around eleven o'clock, Old Sun comes to the yard again, looking here and there. If he finds something has been damaged, he will mutter and grumble as he repairs it, saying:

    "...Comrades, don't you know, I'm angry! How can I not be angry? These comrades, they've all studied..." This is almost his catchphrase. "But, after studying for so long, they still waste public property. Look," he said, pointing to a chair with a broken leg, "if this were bought with his own money, wouldn't he feel the pain?..." So, he took out a hammer and nails from his pocket and started repairing it with a dinging and banging. But what he loves most is the grape trellis. Every night, especially on windy days, he always stands under the grape trellis for a long time, checking which branches need to be tied and which bunches of grapes need to be hung with hemp rope.

    In August, the grapes ripened. One midday, I was awakened by a burst of noise. I went to the courtyard and saw many people gathered under the grape trellis, dividing the grapes. Some said they wanted to send a pot to so-and-so; some said so-and-so had several children and should get a bigger share; those who got less pouted and stood there angry; those who were satisfied sat under the grape trellis and ate happily. In just half an hour, the grapes were all gone. Old Sun wasn't there. When dividing the grapes, people forgot about Old Sun. No one mentioned him, no one thought of leaving some for the old man, not even a small bunch...

    That night, Old Sun came as usual, with his big pruning shears and a small bundle of hemp rope. But, there were no grapes on the trellis. Old Sun walked over and looked at me with a smile:

    "Try a bunch, Old Wang."

    "Old Sun, they were all divided at noon."

    "Ah?!" He doubted my words and reached out to feel. Yes, the grapes were gone. He looked at the ground again, the ground was littered with grape skins.

    "This trellis of grapes should be harvested, have all the children got their share?" he asked. I nodded, and the old man smiled. He smiled so naturally. It was as if all those who had eaten the grapes were in front of him, and he was like a chef watching the guests eat the dishes he had cooked with his own hands, like a writer watching readers read his works. The old man's smile, without a trace of worry, deeply touched me. The old man looked up at the long sky, there was not a cloud in the sky, and the milky white Milky Way faintly smeared across the lovely blue night sky. "Yes, what wonderful weather, you see, if we could use some scrap wood to make a few chairs with backs under this grape trellis, like in a park, how wonderful!" he said, talking endlessly. He said that next year, he plans to move the grape trellis to the front of the red wall on the east side. He said that the grape vines will climb onto the windows, and in the summer, the people in the house won't be exposed to the western sun. He said that this year's effort was not enough, and next year he must make the grapes grow even more and more plump...

　　葡萄
　　——劳动者小记之二
　　汪明
    我们的小院子里，有一座葡萄架。再过些日子，弯弯曲曲的藤蔓就会爬满每一根梁柱，宽宽大大的叶子会在每一根藤蔓上伸展开来。那时候，葡萄架像一张翠绿色的天篷似的，支在院子里。早晨，露珠安静的躺在叶子上，那么晶莹、可爱，简直舍不得用手去碰它一下，如果从这天篷的空隙往上看，天上会有一两颗小星星，在一片玫瑰色的云块里挣扎着，不肯离去。晚上，那就更有趣了，人们在天篷底下乘凉、喝茶、谈天，这时候，大人给孩子们讲故事，要孩子们往天上看，于是我又听到了为人们重复了千百遍的童话，大人要孩子们不要吱声，看看是不是能听得到织女的哭泣………葡萄架给我们带来了许多好处，都从心眼里喜欢它。
    这个葡萄架，就是我们的公务员老孙头一手栽培起来的。老孙头有五十多岁了，但是他身体结实，精神健旺；如果不认识他，从背影看上去，他那宽宽大大的肩膀，高高的个子，笔直的脊梁，你准会把他当成一个壮年人。他在我们这里工作已经八年了。每天早晨，他在院子里扫地、浇花、修剪葡萄架，每天晚上，大约总是在十一点钟左右吧，老孙头又来到院子里，看看这里，看看那里，如果碰到有什么东西被人毁坏了，他就会嘟嘟囔囔地边修理着那被毁坏了的东西，边说：
    “……同志，你不知道，我气呀！我怎么能不气呢？这些同志，都是学习过的……”这几乎是他的口头禅了。“可是，学习了半天，还是要糟踏公家东西，你看，”他指着一个折断腿的椅子对我说：“这要是他自己的钱买的，他能不心疼？……”于是，他从口袋里摸出了鎯头、钉子，钉钉噹噹的修理起来了。但是他最心爱的，还是那个葡萄架了。每天晚上，特别是刮风的日子，他总要在葡萄架下站上好半天，看看哪一根枝子需要扎一扎，哪一串葡萄需要用麻绳吊一吊。
    8月，葡萄熟透了。一天中午，我被一阵喧闹吵醒了。走到院子里，看见许多人围在葡萄架下分葡萄，有的说要给某某送一盆去；有的说某某有几个孩子，应当多分一些；分少了的嘟着嘴站在那里生气；满意了的就坐在葡萄架下快活的吃着；仅仅半个钟头，葡萄分光了。老孙头不在场，分葡萄的时候人们忘却了老孙头，没有人提起他，没有人想到要给老人留下一些，哪怕是一小串……
    这天晚上，老孙头又像往常一样的来了，带着他的那把大剪刀和一小捆麻绳。可是，架子上的葡萄没有了。老孙头走过来，笑咪咪的看着我：
    “尝一串吧，老汪。”
    “老孙头，中午已经分光了。”
    “啊？！……”他怀疑我的话，伸开手来摸摸，是呵，葡萄没有了；他又看看地下，地下是一片狼籍的葡萄皮。
    “这一架葡萄也该收了，小孩子都分到了么？”他问，我点点头，老人微笑了。笑得那么自然。那些吃葡萄的人仿佛都在他的面前，他像一个厨师似的在看着客人们吃着他亲手炒出来的菜，像一个作家似的在看着读者读他的著作。老人的没有一片忧愁的微笑深深地打动了我。老人抬头仰望长空，天上没有一朵云，乳白色的银河淡淡地抹过蓝得逗人爱的夜空。“是呵，多好的天气呵，你看，如果要在这葡萄架下，用一些废木料，做几个靠背椅，像公园那样，多棒！”他滔滔不绝地说起来了。他说，明年，他打算把葡萄架移到东边的那一面红墙跟前去，他说那葡萄藤会爬到窗子上去，夏天，房子里的人就不会西晒了。他说今年的工夫用得还不够，明年一定要让葡萄结得更多更饱满……
