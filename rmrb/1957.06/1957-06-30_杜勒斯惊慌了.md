　　Dulles is Panicked

On the 27th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a special trip from Washington to San Francisco on the West Coast. On the 28th, he delivered a speech there that was strongly hostile to the Chinese people. In this speech, which had been announced a few days earlier, Dulles declared that the United States would continue to pursue its bankrupt policy towards China: refusing to trade with China, refusing to recognize the People's Republic of China, continuing to occupy Taiwan and support the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and continuing to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

What Dulles announced has long been the old refrain of the U.S. State Department, tedious rhetoric that people are already tired of hearing. What made it necessary for Dulles to add more mileage to his flight record, rushing from Washington to San Francisco, to reiterate the U.S. determination to remain stuck in this dead end?

Dulles's choice to deliver this speech in San Francisco on the U.S. West Coast is very telling. It is precisely the merchants in this region, which once had a large amount of trade with China, who recently, following the anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan and the relaxation of trade embargoes against China by Western European countries, have made strong demands to trade with China. This demand, combined with the recent calls both in the United States and abroad to re-examine U.S. policy towards China, has formed a powerful trend. This tide of criticism of U.S. policy toward China has made the gentlemen in the State Department, who sit in a dead end with their eyes closed, feel panicked.

It can be seen from the concerns expressed in Dulles's speech that this trend has had an impact not only in the United States, but also throughout the world, especially in Asia. Dulles is worried that if the United States changes its current policy toward China, it will render the U.S. plan to subvert the People's Republic of China hopeless and further sharpen the contradictions between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek Group. Moreover, the anti-communist theory that the United States uses to create tension in Asia and control certain countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia is also in danger of complete bankruptcy. Moreover, once the People's Republic of China regains its legitimate seat in the United Nations, it will be even more difficult for the United States to manipulate the United Nations.

Who says Dulles's worries are unfounded? After the recent series of events proved that the U.S. policy toward China has completely failed, the situation in Asia is developing in the direction Dulles is worried about.

Dulles panicked, panicked to the point of seeming somewhat neurotic. He even fantasized about using this speech to stabilize the situation, shut the mouths of those who demand a change in China policy, and block the roads that many countries seeking to improve relations with China are exploring. Dulles's speech is clearly part of the overall plan of the United States to create tension, step up subversion, and intensify military control in many places in Asia recently.

However, Dulles has fewer and fewer arguments to impress his audience, and the U.S. intentions toward China are becoming more and more blatantly exposed. The only argument Dulles put forward is that the People's Republic of China is a "temporary thing." Therefore, the United States should "do everything possible" to make the People's Republic of China "disappear," and should not do business with China, otherwise it will help China "produce tanks, trucks, airplanes, munitions and other military supplies." Obviously Dulles himself also knows that his argument is very weak and cannot stabilize the situation. Therefore, he added a footnote timidly, leaving a way out, saying that the China policy he announced is the past and present policy of the United States. As for the future, then, these policies are "constantly under review."

The hatred of Dulles and his ilk for the Chinese people has been fully vented. But unfortunately, Dulles can only rant and rave, but he is powerless. The People's Republic of China is indeed a "temporary thing." Because, according to the theory of Marxism-Leninism, the state will eventually wither away. However, the "temporariness" as predicted by Dulles is a fantasy that will never be realized. Some of the gentlemen who once ambitiously planned to strangle the Soviet state in its cradle are already "buried under ancient trees," and some are also "about to die," while the first socialist country they cursed – the Soviet Union – is thriving and prospering. Dulles is so stupid that he has forgotten even this point of knowledge.

### 杜勒斯惊慌了

　　杜勒斯惊慌了
    27日，美国国务卿杜勒斯特地从华盛顿赶到西海岸的旧金山，28日，他就在那里发表了一篇强烈地敌视中国人民的演说。在这篇几天以前就预告了的演说里，杜勒斯宣布，美国将继续执行它的破产了的对华政策：拒绝同中国进行贸易，拒绝承认中华人民共和国，继续侵占台湾、支持蒋介石集团，继续阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。
    杜勒斯宣布的这些东西，早已成了美国国务院的老生常谈，成了使人早经听腻了的陈词谰言。什么事情使得杜勒斯必须在他的飞行记录上再增加一些里程，从华盛顿急急忙忙地赶到旧金山，来重申美国决心赖在这条死胡同里不出来呢？
    杜勒斯选择在美国西海岸的旧金山来发表这篇演说，是很能说明问题的。因为，正是这个曾经同中国有过大量贸易往来的地区的商人，最近在台湾人民反美示威和西欧国家放宽对华贸易禁运以后，提出了同中国进行贸易的强烈要求。这种要求同美国国内外最近出现的重新审查美国对华政策的要求结合在一起，形成了一股有力的潮流。这股批评美国对华政策的潮流，使得闭起眼睛坐在死胡同里的国务院的老爷们觉得心惊肉跳了。
    从杜勒斯演说中所表示的担心可以看出，这股潮流不但在美国发生了影响，而且在全世界、特别是在亚洲也发生了影响。杜勒斯担心，美国要是改变现在的对华政策，就会使美国颠覆中华人民共和国的打算从此绝望，会使美国同蒋介石集团之间的矛盾更加尖锐。不但如此，美国用来在亚洲制造紧张局势、控制太平洋和东南亚地区某些国家的一套反共理论，也有彻底破产的危险。而且，中华人民共和国一旦恢复了它在联合国里的合法地位，美国要操纵联合国就更加难乎其难了。
    谁说杜勒斯这种担心没有道理呢？在最近接二连三发生的事件证明美国的对华政策已经彻底破产以后，亚洲的事态正在朝着杜勒斯所担心的方向发展。
    杜勒斯惊慌了，惊慌得似乎有点神经失常了。他竟异想天开地企图用这一篇演说来压住阵脚，封住那些要求改变对华政策的人的嘴，堵住那些想改善同中国的关系的许多国家正在试探的道路。杜勒斯这篇演说，显然是美国最近在亚洲许多地方广泛进行的制造紧张局势、加紧颠覆活动和军事控制的整个计划的一部分。
    可是，杜勒斯能够用来打动他的听众的论据，却是越来越少了，而美国对中国的打算，也越来越露骨地暴露出来了。杜勒斯提出的唯一论据，就是中华人民共和国是“暂时的东西”。因此，美国应该“尽一切力量”来使中华人民共和国“消逝”，而不应该同中国做生意，否则就会帮助中国“生产坦克、载重汽车、飞机、军火和其他军需物资的东西”。显然杜勒斯自己也知道，他的这种论据是十分无力的，是压不住阵脚的。因此，他又畏畏缩缩地加上了一个注脚，留下一个后步，说他宣布的对华政策，是美国以往和目前的政策。至于将来，那末，这些政策都是在“常常检讨之中的”。
    杜勒斯之流对中国人民的仇恨，虽然完全发泄出来了。但是可惜得很，杜勒斯只能暴跳如雷，却是无能为力。中华人民共和国的确是“暂时的东西”。因为，按照马克思—列宁主义的理论，国家最后是要消亡的。但是，像杜勒斯所预言那样的“暂时”性，却是永远不会实现的幻想。曾经雄心勃勃地策划把苏维埃国家扼杀在摇篮之中的先生们，有些“墓木已拱”了，有些也“行将就木”了，而他们所咒诅的第一个社会主义国家——苏联却欣欣向荣，蒸蒸日上。杜勒斯竟愚蠢到连这一点知识都忘记了。
