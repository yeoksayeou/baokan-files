    Has the Living Standard of the Masses Not Improved?

    Editor: I am an ordinary farmer's daughter with a low level of education, but I have a nose, and I can tell the difference between fragrance and stench.

    I read that Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at Renmin University of China, said: "The only people whose living standards have improved are those Party members and cadres who used to wear torn shoes but now ride in small cars and wear woolen uniforms." I cannot agree. I also want to express what we farmers think. All I know is that before Liberation, we never wore fine cloth clothes; even coarse cloth clothes were patched upon patched. In the summer, we even just wore shorts to work. We ate half chaff and vegetables and half grain. As the saying goes, "When the sickle is on the wall, there is no food to eat." Grain was sold cheaply after the autumn harvest, and it was impossible to buy it back at a high price in the spring. We didn't even dream of eating meat or oil. Speaking of the current living standards, they are much better than in the past. In the past, eight out of ten households couldn't get enough to eat, let alone eat meat. Tofu is a relatively cheap thing, but in the past, we could only eat a little during the New Year. Now, we eat it more often than in the past. At the same time, we have also heard that soybeans need to be exported in part to exchange for construction equipment to build our country. Today, our country can produce cars and tractors and consolidate national defense, so we are not subject to enemy invasion. We have no objection to eating less.

    Yes, some people's lives are also worse than in the past. In our cooperative, out of more than 500 households, there are dozens of households who used to wear fine cloth and silk, eat fish and meat, and be waited on by others as landlords. Today, they also have to work themselves.

    This is how I view our government and cadres. In the past, our ancestors, in addition to owing rent and taxes and being conscripted into the army and imprisoned, never dared to go to the yamen. After Liberation, we can go, and the cadres eat with us and don't dislike us. In the past, farmers relied on God's blessing when they got sick. Today, rural health clinics and epidemic prevention stations have been established, and the cooperative also has broadcasts. The county head and township head sometimes talk to us and work in the fields together. In the old society, we didn't even dare to look at the county head and township head; even so, their civilized canes were still "bestowed" upon us!

    In 1954, our hometown suffered an unprecedented flood, but no one starved or froze to death. All I know is that without the Communist Party, we would have drowned, frozen, and starved to death. Whether in work or labor, Communist Party members always walk in front of us and lead us forward. But there are also bad people who have sneaked into the Party and are doing bad things. Naturally, these people should be opposed. We farmers support the Communist Party and are patriotic.

### 群众生活水平没提高吗？

    群众生活水平没提高吗？
    编者同志：我是一个普通农民的女孩子，文化程度很低，但是一个长了鼻子的人，香和臭总能闻出的。
    我看了中国人民大学讲师葛佩琦讲的：生活水平提高的仅是过去穿破鞋、现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部。我不能同意。我也想说说我们农民心里的话。我只知道解放前，我们没穿过细布衣，连粗布衣服也是补丁上加补丁，夏天甚至只穿条短裤去干活。我们吃的是半年糠菜半年粮。俗语说：“镰刀上壁，没饭吃”，粮食秋收低价卖去，春天高价买不到，吃肉吃油谈不到。拿现在的生活水平来说，比过去好得多了。过去十户人家，有八家吃不饱饭，更难吃到肉。豆腐是比较便宜的东西，可是我们过去也只能在过年时吃一点，现在我们吃的次数比过去增多了。同时，我们也听说过，黄豆要出口一部分，换回建设器材来建设我们的祖国。今天在我们的国家里能出产汽车、拖拉机，能够巩固国防，不受敌人的侵略，我们再少吃点也没有意见。
    是的，有的人生活也有比过去差些的。我们社里，在五百多户中有几十户，他们过去都是穿细布和绸缎，吃鱼吃肉，有人侍候的地主，今天他们也要自己劳动了。
    我对我们的政府和干部是这样看的。过去我们祖祖辈辈除了欠租税，被抓壮丁坐牢外，从来不敢走到衙门里。解放后，我们能去了，干部和我们一块吃饭，不讨厌我们。过去农民生病靠天保佑，今天农村建立了卫生所、防疫站，社里还有了广播。县长、乡长有时也和我们谈话，一块下田劳动。旧社会里，县长、乡长我们连看一眼也不敢看，就是这样，他们的文明棍还在我们身上“恩赐”呢！
    1954年，我们家乡闹从来没有过的大水灾，没饿死冻死一个人。我只知道没有共产党，我们就会淹死了，冻饿死了。无论在工作和劳动中，共产党员总是走在我们的前面，带我们前进。但也有投机钻到党里搞坏事的坏人。对于这些人，自然是应该反对的。我们农民是拥护共产党的，是爱国的。
