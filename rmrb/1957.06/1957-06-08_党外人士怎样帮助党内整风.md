    I. Two Characteristics of the Working-Class Party

    The Chinese Communist Party, that is, the party of the Chinese working class, like all working-class parties in the world, has two characteristics that no other class party can have:

    First, at any time, it never conceals its positive political views, and it considers it shameful to do so. What are its positive political views? It is that the working class must overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist system so that the working class and all working people can be completely liberated. To achieve the goal of overthrowing the capitalist system and establishing a socialist system, the working class must go through the class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie and completely eliminate the bourgeoisie (under special historical conditions, the bourgeoisie can also be eliminated through peaceful transformation). The class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie is often long-term and complex. To carry out the class struggle to the end, it is necessary to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat (or people's democratic dictatorship); to carry out class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, to establish a socialist system, and to eliminate the capitalist system, it is necessary to have the comprehensive leadership of the working-class party (comprehensive leadership of all social and national life, from material production to the ideological sphere); the comprehensive leadership of the working-class party over social and national life is to adhere to Marxism-Leninism as a guide to action. This series of positive political views of the working-class party is not determined by the subjective wishes of the working-class party, but by objective social existence, that is, by the inevitability of social development laws formed by social material living conditions. It is fully in line with the fundamental interests of the working class and all working people, so it does not need to be concealed, and it cannot be concealed even if it wants to.

    Second, at any time, it does not cover up its negative shortcomings and mistakes, and it considers it even more shameful to do so. It not only does not cover up its shortcomings and mistakes, but also constantly exposes its shortcomings and mistakes. It not only relies on itself to constantly expose its shortcomings and mistakes, but also mobilizes the broad masses to help expose its shortcomings and mistakes. It not only wants to expose its shortcomings and mistakes, but also to dig out the ideological roots from which the shortcomings and mistakes arise, to learn lessons from the shortcomings and mistakes, and to resolve to correct its shortcomings and mistakes. Its method is to proceed from the desire for unity, go through criticism, and achieve further unity on a new basis. The working-class party, especially the Chinese Communist Party, is a large party with more than 12 million members. China is also a large country with a population of 600 million. It lacks sufficient experience in carrying out socialist construction in such a large country, especially lacking sufficient class education for the working class and ideological education in Marxism-Leninism. It is incomprehensible to have no shortcomings and mistakes in the cause of socialist construction, specifically, in the economic, political power, and cultural and educational construction. It is also incomprehensible not to form contradictions among the people when there are shortcomings and mistakes (even some very serious shortcomings and mistakes). This series of shortcomings and mistakes, or contradictions among the people, in a new and dramatic great change, is not determined by the subjective wishes of the working-class party, but must have its social and political basis. For example, the Chinese Communist Party is already in the position of the ruling party nationwide, and social relations have undergone fundamental changes, but many comrades in the party do not understand or do not fully understand this change and their position, and are prone to take simple administrative orders to deal with problems, and even become infected with the remnants of the Kuomintang style of the old society, forming a kind of privilege thinking, thereby producing bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that are divorced from the masses and reality. This cannot be concealed, and it cannot be concealed even if it wants to.

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have launched another rectification movement within the party, encouraging non-party members to speak out freely and supervise each other in order to correctly handle contradictions among the people and adapt to the needs of socialist transformation and socialist construction. This is a very timely and wise measure. The historical victory of the working class and its party has been based on this, and the Chinese Communist Party has full confidence in this. The problem is how non-party members can help the party rectification. Below, I will focus on discussing this issue.

    II. Only by Firmly Adopting a Stand and Correcting Attitudes Can We Help the Rectification

    So, how can we help the party rectification? It is necessary to expose the shortcomings and mistakes of certain party organizations and party comrades as much as possible and without reservation, to expose the contradictions among the people that arise from this, and to concentrate the firepower on opposing bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of an overlord, which are divorced from the masses and reality, so that bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of an overlord are gradually reduced, and the relationship among the people takes on a new look. Judging from the shortcomings and mistakes of various agencies, schools, regions, departments, and units that have been exposed, they are all caused by the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism of certain party organizations and individual party members who are divorced from the masses and reality; but we must never see the entire party as having bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Some people, because there are contradictions in schools, advocate abolishing the party committee system in schools; because there are contradictions in joint state-private enterprises, they advocate abolishing public representatives, etc. This is worth considering carefully. I think the problem does not lie in the system, but in the fact that certain party organizations and individual party members have not used this system reasonably and legally. In other words, this is not a problem of the system, but more than half of it is a problem of people. If people are not good, no system will be good. If the system is not good, good people alone will not be able to do good things. The ancients said: "Mere goodness is not enough for politics, and mere law cannot be implemented by itself." The former refers to people, and the latter refers to the system. It shows that the combination of people and the system is a comprehensive view, otherwise it is one-sided. All one-sided ways of looking at problems are idealistic methods. And between the system and people, people are more important than the system. Without good people to use a good system, any good system is a dead thing. So the rectification is mainly to rectify people, to rectify the bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of an overlord of certain people.

    Why do certain party comrades have bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of an overlord? I think it is basically a matter of stand. A part of the party members with an unstable stand is infected with the remnants of the Kuomintang style of the old society, forming a kind of privileged thinking, and losing the stand of the working class. So the party rectification is to ask those members who have lost the stand of the working class and have privileged thinking to correct their mistakes and restore the stand of the working class. For intellectual party members, it is also important to require them to connect with the workers and peasants, to distinguish between the proletarian stand and the stand of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, to strengthen party spirit, and to strengthen ideological education in Marxism-Leninism. So I think the party rectification movement is essentially a movement to strengthen ideological education, class education, and a firm stand within the party. Therefore, non-party members helping the party rectification must also first have a stand, at least a people's stand, and preferably a working-class stand (we are transitioning to socialism, and people from all walks of life outside the party are transforming to the working class, this requirement is not high). If there is no working-class stand and we are still standing on the stand of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie to help party comrades who have lost the stand of the working class to regain their footing on the working-class stand, it is absolutely impossible, because we must never use bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. If so, we will not be of any help to the party rectification movement.

    In addition, the Central Committee's instructions for this rectification movement are to take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the current theme of the rectification. For the Communist Party itself, the main task for the leading organs and cadres is to check the situation of handling contradictions among the people, to check the implementation of the policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," and "building the country with diligence and thrift," to check the bureaucratic phenomena that are divorced from the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and intellectuals; to check the sectarian phenomena that do not proceed from the interests of the 600 million people, do not proceed from the unity of all nationalities, all parties, and the broad masses of non-party members, and do not proceed from the unity of the whole party; to check the subjective phenomena that do not proceed from the actual situation, and to truly implement the Central Committee's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people. Then, the main task for non-party members helping the party rectification is to help party comrades seriously check these situations and phenomena so that contradictions among the people can be correctly handled and resolved. If we deviate from the serious inspection of the situation of the party's major policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," and "building the country with diligence and thrift," and deviate from the serious inspection of these serious phenomena of bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses, sectarianism that does not proceed from unity, and subjectivism that does not proceed from the actual situation, and are too picky about small pinholes and small loopholes, this will divert the attention of the current theme of the rectification, weaken the effect of the rectification, and will not be able to achieve the purpose of helping the party rectification.

    Also, this rectification movement is an ideological education movement that is both serious and earnest and gentle and moderate, that is, a movement of appropriate criticism and self-criticism. For the Communist Party itself, it must boldly encourage criticism and resolutely implement the principles of "Know everything and say everything, say everything without reservation," "The speaker is not guilty, the listener should take warning," "Correct mistakes if you have them, and be encouraged if you don't." It should not affirm everything about itself and reject criticism from others. At the same time, for critics, it must be realistic and analyze specifically, so as not to obliterate everything about others, to turn criticism into one-sided and excessive criticism, and to turn criticism into criticism that the other party cannot accept. Everyone should humbly listen to the opinions of others and actively give opinions to others, but must not force the criticized to accept criticism that he does not agree with; for those who are found to have made mistakes in the rectification movement, except for those who seriously violate the law and discipline, it is also stated that no organizational sanctions will be given in general, and positive and patient help will be given to achieve the purpose of "curing the disease and saving the person." This is the principle and attitude of the party rectification. Then, if non-party members want to truly achieve the purpose of helping the party rectification, they must also adhere to this principle and attitude. But recently, what I have seen in some newspapers or heard at symposiums does not necessarily maintain this attitude. Some are impassioned, and some are scolding and accusing (of course, very few). This may be because some people have indeed been wronged and suffered injustice, so they cannot help but come out to speak out on their behalf, which is understandable. But what I regret very much is that under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and fascists, progressive people were persecuted and suppressed by all means, and innocent young people were framed and murdered, and their grievances sank to the bottom of the sea, never to be redressed. At that time, very few people were seen to come out to say a few ordinary words of justice, and even more dared not to speak out with passion, scold, and accuse. Is it that people who are used to living in a fire pit feel at ease, but cannot hear the buzzing of bees when they arrive in paradise? This may not be surprising. But we must not use this as a basis to cover up the shortcomings and mistakes of Communist Party members, and to say that the behavior of certain Communist Party members who do not respect the personality of others and violate laws and regulations is reasonable and legal. Here, I only hope that some non-party members who help the party rectification can calm down after comparing the past with the present, and do not let individual Communist Party members with a rude attitude say that the attitude of non-party members is also rude. This is a matter of correcting the attitude of helping the party rectification. And we must know that since the beginning of history, after all, only one party—the Chinese Communist Party—can be so humble, know its mistakes and correct them, and "rejoice when it hears of its mistakes." It asks its party members who have made mistakes against the people to first extend their hands to the people, apologize, and seek to achieve the goal of uniting the people of the whole country. After this rectification, I believe that the 600 million people of China will inevitably unite further around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and jointly shoulder the heavy burden of building socialism. China is, after all, the China of the Chinese people, and the world is, after all, the world of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party has absolutely no thought of any interests of the party itself other than the interests of the people. The privileged thinking of individual party members, or the "party's world" thinking, as some people say, must not be taken as a whole. When non-party members are helping the party rectification, although they should try their best to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of individual party organizations and individual party members without reservation, they must never throw away the lovely baby with the dirty water in the bathtub.

    III. Two Current Phenomena Worthy of Attention

    More than a month has passed since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on the rectification movement on April 27 this year. If we regard the study of the ideologically guiding reports made by Chairman Mao on behalf of the Central Committee at the enlarged Supreme State Council meeting in February this year and at the Central Propaganda Conference in March as the beginning of the rectification movement, it has been almost four months now. Although the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao sincerely called on non-party members to help the rectification, some party organizations and individual party members still seem to have resistance, and dare not or are unwilling to encourage non-party members to speak out boldly, and boldly raise opinions and criticisms, and even express disgust and indignation at many opinions and criticisms that have been spoken out, that is, they refuse non-party members to help the rectification. This phenomenon is not good. Xunzi said: "Those who say that I am right are my friends, and those who say that I am wrong are my teachers." I think this is not enough, and a sentence should be added, "Those who say that I am wrong but are not right are also not my teachers." This spirit is the spirit of the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao. Any party organization and party member should have this kind of mind in the rectification movement, otherwise the rectification will become a formality, and asking non-party members to help the rectification will also become empty talk, and their own bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the airs of an overlord will never be rectified.

    There is also another phenomenon. For more than a month, speaking out has greatly expanded, and raising opinions and criticisms seems to have reached a very sharp point. There are those who are impassioned, and those who are scolding and accusing, but it seems that some people still think that speaking out is not enough, and there are still many things that have not been spoken out, and there are still many things locked in the safe, and non-party members cannot speak them out either. This is probably also the fact. Contradictions must be thoroughly exposed, and the roots of the poisonous sores must be pulled out from the roots. If there are still things that have not been spoken out, they must be allowed to speak out to the fullest extent. The rectification movement carried out by the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao is precisely to achieve this. But in the speaking out, it seems that some people still have all kinds of worries, dare not speak out, fearing retaliation and attacks, unwilling to speak out, fearing that the shortcomings and mistakes pointed out will not be corrected and improved in the end. This contains components that start from the individual, and do not think of the interests of the people and the interests of socialist construction, so they should not be afraid of this and that; this also contains components that do not have enough trust in the party, thinking that the saying that mistakes must be corrected and that rectification and improvement go hand in hand is not necessarily reliable. In fact, whether starting from the individual or not having enough trust in the party is due to the fact that they fundamentally do not understand the historical significance of the working-class revolution, especially because they fundamentally do not understand the prestige of the working-class party—the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao—among the people of the whole country, and even among the people of the world, especially among the people of all fraternal countries. Some people doubt that the Chinese people and the Chinese party will be separated, or want to separate the Chinese people and the Chinese party. This is not only a "cliché," as Khrushchev said to an American radio reporter, but also due to his complete blindness and ignorance. This is not good, this cannot solve the problem, and this cannot help the party rectification movement.

    If we want to help the party rectification, we must speak out what we think has not been spoken out completely, thoroughly, and entirely. Because individual party organizations and individual party members have committed serious shortcomings and mistakes in the past few years, replacing policies with feelings, and turning good things into bad things, there are indeed facts that are intolerable. However, except for those who seriously violate laws and discipline, we non-party members can only give positive and patient help, and do not get angry as soon as we mention them, and even clench our fists to vent our personal anger. That is to say, do not hate him as an enemy, but treat him as a patient to be saved. There is an old Chinese saying: "Give loyal advice and guide him well." This is the attitude that we non-party members should have when helping party comrades who have made mistakes in the party rectification. If "Give loyal advice and guide him well," and he still ignores it, there is another old Chinese saying in China called "Tearfully admonish him." This is also the attitude that we non-party members should have when helping party comrades who have made mistakes in the party rectification. Only in this way can we meet the requirements of correctly handling contradictions among the people and rectification. In this way, can we complete the sacred task of helping the party rectification. The ancients said: "Sincerity can move heaven," and also said: "There is nothing that can compare to the greatest sincerity." Whether we can help the party rectification is a crucial condition. We must sincerely offer suggestions from the desire for unity. We must launch appropriate criticism, not just vent our personal anger. The rectification movement, for the party, is both a serious and earnest and gentle and moderate ideological education movement. Non-party members must also be like this in order to achieve a common ideological improvement with the rectification movement. Non-party members also need to achieve a common ideological improvement in the movement to help the party rectification. The ancients said: "Only after you have it in yourself can you ask it of others, and only after you do not have it in yourself can you criticize it in others." These two sentences are especially worthy of our deep thought when helping the party rectification!

    党外人士怎样帮助党内整风
    邓初民
    一，工人阶级政党的两个特点
    中国共产党，亦即中国工人阶级的政党，和全世界所有工人阶级的政党一样，它具有与任何其他阶级的政党都不可能有的两个特点：
    第一，在任何时候，它决不隐瞒它的正面的政治主张，它认为这样作是可耻的。它正面的政治主张是什么呢？是工人阶级必须推翻资本主义制度，建立社会主义制度，工人阶级和全体劳动人民才能得到彻底的解放。工人阶级要达到推翻资本主义制度，建立社会主义制度的目的，必须通过工人阶级与资产阶级的阶级斗争，彻底消灭资产阶级（在特殊的历史条件下，也可用和平改造的方式消灭资产阶级。）工人阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争，往往是长期的、复杂的，要把阶级斗争进行到底，必须实行无产阶级专政（或人民民主专政）；进行阶级斗争和无产阶级专政，建立社会主义制度，消灭资本主义制度，必须要有工人阶级政党的全面领导（从物质生产起到思想领域止的一切社会生活和国家生活的全面领导）；工人阶级政党对于社会生活和国家生活的全面领导，是坚持以马克思列宁主义为行动指南的。工人阶级政党这一系列的正面的政治主张，不是由工人阶级政党的主观愿望决定的，而是由客观的社会存在决定的，也就是说由社会物质生活条件所形成的社会发展规律的必然性决定的，它完全符合工人阶级和全体劳动人民的根本利益，所以它用不着隐瞒，要隐瞒也隐瞒不了。
    第二，在任何时候，它不掩盖它反面的缺点和错误，它认为这样作更是可耻的。它不唯不掩盖它的缺点和错误，还要经常揭露自己的缺点和错误，它不仅依靠自己本身经常揭露自己的缺点和错误，而且还要发动广大群众来帮助揭露它的缺点和错误，它不仅要揭露它的缺点和错误在那里，而且要挖掘出缺点和错误所由产生的思想根源，要从缺点和错误中吸取教训，决心改正自己的缺点和错误，而其方式、方法，则是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评，在新的基础上达到进一步团结的目的。工人阶级的政党，特别是中国共产党，它是一个有着一千二百多万党员的大党，中国又是一个拥有六亿人口的大国，它要在这样一个大国来进行社会主义建设，还缺乏足够的经验，特别是缺乏足够的工人阶级的阶级教育和马克思列宁主义的思想教育，在社会主义建设事业中，具体的说，在经济、政权建设和文教建设事业中，没有缺点和错误是不可理解的，有了缺点和错误（甚至有些是很严重的缺点和错误），而不形成人民内部矛盾，也是不可理解的。这一系列的缺点和错误，或者说人民内部矛盾，在一个新的剧烈的伟大变革中，也不是由工人阶级政党的主观愿望决定的，而必然有它的社会基础和政治基础。例如中国共产党已在全国范围内处在执政党的地位，社会关系已起了根本变化，而党内有许多同志并不了解或者不很了解这种变化和自己所处的地位，容易采取单纯的行政命令办法来处理问题，甚至沾染了旧社会国民党作风的残余，形成一种特权思想，从而产生脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。这是不能掩盖的，要掩盖也是掩盖不了的。
    中国共产党中央和毛主席在党内又一次展开了整风运动，鼓励党外人士大放大鸣，互相监督，以便正确处理人民内部矛盾，来适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要，这是非常及时的英明措施。工人阶级及其政党的历史性的胜利，已奠基于此，这在中国共产党来说是有它充分的信心的，问题是在党外人士如何来帮助党内整风。下面我就要着重地来谈这个问题。
    二，只有坚定立场，端正态度，才能帮助整风
    那么，我们怎样来帮助党内整风呢？就是要尽量地、毫无保留地揭露某些党组织和党的同志们的缺点和错误，揭露因此而产生的人民内部矛盾，而其火力则要集中在反对脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义和老爷架子上，使官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子逐渐减少，使人民内部的关系面貌一新。从当前所揭露出来的各机关、各学校、各地区、各部门、各单位的缺点和错误来看，都是由某些党组织和党员个人脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义造成的；但是决不能把整个党看成有官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义。有人因为学校里有矛盾，就主张取消学校里的党委制；公私合营企业里有矛盾，就主张取消公方代表等等，这是值得慎重考虑的。我认为问题并不在于制度，而在某些党组织和党员个人没有合理合法地运用这一制度。换一句话说，这不是制度问题，而有一大半是人的问题，人不好，什么制度也不会好，制度不好，单靠好人也不会办出好事来，古人说：“徒善不足以为政，徒法不能以自行”，前者是指人说的，后者是指制度说的，它说明人与制度两者必须结合起来，才是全面的观点，否则就是片面的。一切片面看问题的方法，都是唯心主义的方法。而在制度与人两者之间，人是比制度更重要的，没有好人来运用好制度，任何好制度都是死的东西。所以整风主要是要整人，整某些人的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子。
    某些党内同志，为什么有了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子呢？我认为基本上是一个立场问题，党内有一部分立场不坚定的分子，沾染了旧社会国民党作风的残余，形成一种特权思想，丧失工人阶级的立场。所以党内整风就是要把那些丧失工人阶级立场的分子、有特权思想的分子，要求他们改正错误，恢复工人阶级的立场。对于知识分子的党员，还要着重要求他们联系工农群众，分清无产阶级立场和资产阶级、小资产阶级的立场，加强党性，加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育。所以我认为党内整风运动，实质上是一个加强党内思想教育、阶级教育、坚定立场的运动。因此党外人士帮助党内整风，也必须首先要有立场，起码要有人民立场，最好是有工人阶级立场（我们正在向社会主义过渡，党外各阶层人士正在向工人阶级转化，这个要求是不算高的），如果没有工人阶级立场，仍然站在资产阶级和小资产阶级立场，来帮助党内丧失了工人阶级立场的同志，从新站稳工人阶级立场，是绝对不可能的，因为我们决不能以官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义来反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，如果这样，我们对于党内整风运动就不会有什么帮助。
    此外，这次整风运动，党中央的指示，是把正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题作为当前整风的主题的，就共产党内部来说，对于各领导机关和干部，主要是要检查处理人民内部矛盾问题的情况，检查对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，“长期共存，互相监督”的方针和“勤俭建国”的方针的执行情况，检查那些脱离工人群众、农民群众、士兵群众、学生和知识分子群众的官僚主义现象；检查那些不从六亿人民利益出发，不从团结各民族、各党派和广大的党外群众出发，不从团结全党出发的宗派主义现象；检查那些不从实际情况出发的主观主义现象，而真正的贯彻执行党中央关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示。那么，党外人士帮助党内整风，主要也就是要帮助党内同志认真地检查这些情况和现象，使人民内部矛盾得到正确处理和解决。如果离开了对于党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，“长期共存，互相监督”和“勤俭建国”这些主要方针情况的认真检查，离开了脱离群众的官僚主义，不从团结出发的宗派主义和不从实际出发的主观主义这几种严重的、丧失阶级立场的现象的认真检查，而过于挑剔小针眼、小漏洞，这将分散当前整风主题的注意力，削弱整风的效果，也就不能达到帮助党内整风的目的。
    还有，这一次整风运动，是一次既严肃认真而又和风细雨的思想教育运动，也就是一个恰如其分的批评与自我批评的运动，这对于共产党内部来说，必须放手鼓励批评，坚决实行“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”的原则，不应该肯定自己的一切，拒绝别人的批评，同时，对于批评者，必须实事求是，具体分析，以免抹煞别人的一切，使批评变成片面的过火的批评，使批评变成令对方不能接受的批评，每个人都应该虚心听取别人的意见，积极地向别人提意见，但是不得强迫被批评者接受他所不同意的批评；对于在整风运动中检查出来犯了错误的人，除严重违法乱纪者外，也说明一概不给以组织上的处分，并且要给以积极的耐心的帮助，这样来达到“治病救人”的目的。这是党内整风所持的原则和态度，那么，党外人士要达到真能帮助党内整风的目的，也必须坚持这种原则和态度。但最近在某些报纸上所看见的，或在座谈会上所听到的，却不一定都能保持这种态度，慷慨激昂者有之，谩骂控诉者有之（当然是极少数），这可能确实有些人受了委曲，遭了冤枉，从而情不自禁的出来为之代鸣不平，这是可以理解的。但令我很为惋惜的，就是在国民党反动派法西斯主义血腥统治下，摧残压迫进步人士，无所不用其极，无辜青年被陷害虐杀者，冤沉海底，永无平反之日，那时，却很少看见有人出来讲几句平平常常的公道话，至于慷慨陈词，谩骂控诉，那就更加不敢了。这是不是住惯火坑的人，反而心安理得，一到乐园就听不得蜜蜂叫呢？这可能也是不足怪的事。但是决不能以此为根据来为共产党员掩盖缺点和错误，来把某些共产党员不尊重别人的人格、违法乱纪的行为，也说成是合理合法的。我在这里只希望帮助党内整风的某些党外人士，把过去与现在对比一番以后，心平气和一些，不要叫态度粗暴的个别共产党员，说党外人士的态度也一样粗暴，这是帮助党内整风要端正态度的问题。而且要知道，自有历史以来，毕竟只有一个党——中国共产党，才能这样虚心，知过改过，“闻过则喜”，要他们对于人民犯了错误的党员，先向人民伸出手来，赔情道歉，以求达到团结全国人民的目的。经过这次整风，我相信中国六亿人民，必然会要进一步团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，把建设社会主义的这副重担子，共同挑上肩来。中国毕竟是中国人民的中国，天下毕竟是中国人民的天下，中国共产党除了人民的利益以外，绝对没有想到党的本身还有任何利益。个别党员的特权思想，或者有如人说的“党天下”的思想，决不能以一斑当全豹。党外人士在帮助党内整风的时候，尽管要尽量地、毫不保留地批评个别党组织和个别党员的缺点和错误，也决不能把可爱的婴儿和澡盆的污水一起泼掉。
    三，当前两种值得注意的现象
    从本年4月27日中国共产党中央发出关于整风运动的指示以后，到现在已有一个多月的时间了。假如把毛主席本年2月在扩大的最高国务会议上和3月在中央召开的宣传会议上代表党中央所作的带有思想指导性的报告的学习，看作就是整风运动的开始，到现在差不多就有将近四个月的时间了。党中央和毛主席虽然诚恳的号召党外人士帮助整风，而某些党组织和党员个人，似乎还有抵触情绪，不敢或不愿鼓励党外人士大胆鸣、放，大胆提意见和批评，甚至对于鸣、放出来的许多意见和批评，表示讨厌和愤慨，也就是说，拒绝党外人士帮助整风，这种现象是不好的。荀子说：“是吾而当者吾友也，非吾而当者吾师也”，我以为这样说还不够，应该加上一句，“非吾而不当者亦无师也”。这种精神，就是党中央和毛主席的精神，任何党组织和党员，在整风运动中，都应该具有这种胸襟，否则整风将流于形式，要求党外人士帮助整风也成为一句空话，而自己的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子也永远整不掉。
    另外还有一种现象，一个多月来，鸣、放已经大大展开了，提意见提批评，似乎已达到很尖锐的地步，所谓慷慨激昂者有之，谩骂控诉者有之，但似乎仍有人认为鸣、放得还不够，还有许多东西没有鸣出来放出来，还有许多东西锁在保险柜里，党外人士也无从鸣出来放出来。这恐怕也是事实。矛盾必须彻底揭发，毒疮脓根必须从根拔掉，假如还有没有鸣、放出来的东西，必须让它尽其所有地鸣、放出来。党中央和毛主席所进行的整风运动，正是要作到这一点。但在鸣、放之中，似乎仍有某些人存在着种种顾虑，不敢放不敢鸣，怕报复打击，不愿放、不愿鸣，怕指出了缺点和错误，始终得不到纠正和改进。这中间包含有从个人出发的成分，没有想到为人民利益，为社会主义建设利益，就不应该前怕虎、后怕龙；这中间也包含有对党信任不够的成分，认为有错必纠、认为边整风边改进的说法不一定靠得住。实际上从个人出发也好，对党不够信任也好，都是由于根本没有理解工人阶级革命的历史意义，特别是由于根本没有理解工人阶级政党——中国共产党和毛主席在全中国人民中的威信，乃至在全世界人民中，特别是在各兄弟国家人民中的威信。有人怀疑中国人民和中国党会分割开来，或者想把中国人民和中国党分割开来，这不仅是有如赫鲁晓夫对美国广播记者所说，是一种“陈腔滥调”，而且是由于他十足的盲目无知。这是不好的，这是不能解决问题的，这是不能帮助党内整风运动的。
    我们要帮助党内整风，必须把我们认为还没有鸣、放出来的东西，干脆、彻底、全部地把它鸣、放干净。因为个别党组织和个别党员，几年来犯有严重的缺点和错误，以感想代替政策，把好事办成坏事，确实是有着令人不能容忍的事实的。然而，除了严重违法乱纪者外，我们党外人士，也只有给以积极的耐心的帮助，不要一提起来就冒火，甚至于握紧拳头，专门出个人的气。也就是说，不要把他当作敌人来恨，而要把他当作病人来救。中国有句古话：“忠告而善道之”，这是我们党外人士帮助党内整风，对于犯了错误的党内同志应有的态度。假若“忠告而善道之”，他还是不理不睬，中国还有一句古话，叫作“垂涕泣而道之”，这也是我们党外人士帮助党内整风，对于犯有错误的党内同志应有的态度。这样才合乎正确地处理人民内部矛盾和整风的要求，这样，才能完成帮助党内整风的神圣任务。古人说：“诚可动天”，又说：“至诚无物”。我们能否帮助党内整风，这是一个带有关键性的条件。我们必须诚诚恳恳地从团结的愿望出发来提意见。来展开恰如其分的批评，决不是个人出口恶气。整风运动，在党内来说，既是一个严肃认真而又和风细雨的思想教育运动，党外人士也必须这样，才能随着整风运动得到思想上的共同提高。党外人士也正需要在帮助党内整风运动中得到思想上的共同提高。古人说：“有诸己而后求诸人，无诸己而后非诸人”。这两句话，在帮助党内整风时，特别值得我们加以深思！
