Xinjiang cotton, cultivated by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region on over 400,000 mu, has successfully weathered the spring cold and is growing normally, currently showing widespread budding. This spring, some reclamation areas in southern and northern Xinjiang suffered from frost and wind disasters, with ground temperatures dropping below zero, delaying cotton emergence and slowing growth. According to the extent of damage to the cotton fields, various military reclamation farms adopted emergency measures to raise ground temperature by harrowing and early cultivation to promote cotton seedling growth. Various field management tasks were also carried out meticulously and promptly, enabling the affected cotton seedlings to safely overcome the spring disaster. Since the end of May, the temperature in various parts of Xinjiang has been steadily rising, which is very conducive to the growth and development of cotton. As of June 20th, except for a small portion of re-sown and replanted cotton seedlings that are not growing uniformly, the vast majority are growing well. The 300,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River basin generally has four to six true leaves and two to three flower buds, with some as high as 20 centimeters. In the Yili reclamation area, which suffered more severe damage, each mu still retains 5,000 to 7,000 seedlings. Cotton seedlings in Turpan are generally flowering. By mid-June, all cotton fields had been cultivated once or twice. In order to promote the rapid development of cotton seedling roots and shorten the growing period, the suggestion of Soviet agricultural expert Golelov was also adopted, and phosphate fertilizer was applied earlier, and the first irrigation period was delayed as much as possible.

　　战胜了冻害风灾  新疆棉花普遍现蕾
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设部队四十多万亩棉花，已顺利渡过春寒，获得正常生长，目前普遍现蕾。今年入春以后，南北疆部分垦区曾遭受到冻害及风灾的侵袭，地温降低到零度以下，棉花出苗推迟，生长缓慢。各军垦农场根据棉田受害情况，分别采取紧急措施，用耙地及提早中耕的办法提高地温，促进棉苗生长，各项田间管理工作也都做得细致及时，这就使受害棉苗安全地渡过了春灾。5月底以后，新疆各地气温一直稳定上升，对棉花生长发育非常有利。到6月20日，除一小部分重播和补播的棉苗生长不够整齐外，绝大部分都长得很好。玛纳斯河流域三十多万亩棉花，已普遍有四至六片真叶和二至三个花蕾，好的已有二十多公分高。受害较重的伊犁垦区一万多亩棉花，每亩仍保苗五千至七千株。吐鲁番的棉苗已普遍开花。到6月中旬，所有棉田都已进行一至二次中耕。为了促进棉苗根系的迅速发育，缩短生长期，还采用了苏联农业专家果列洛夫的建议，普遍提早追施磷肥，并尽量推迟了第一次灌水期。
