　　China's Largest Machinery Plant
    The Prototype of Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant Takes Shape
    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 19th: The Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, currently under intense construction and set to be China's largest machinery plant, has been under construction for a year since the first pillar of the factory building project was erected last June. Last year, this place was still a desolate grassland; now, along the Nen River, newly built red and magnificent buildings are connected into a vast area, covering about thirty to forty *li*. The sixteen large factory buildings, representing a massive engineering undertaking, have generally commenced construction this year. The metal structure, auxiliary, and model workshops, which were built first, have been basically completed, and installation workers have entered the workshops to install cranes and equipment. The foundation piling projects for the four major main workshops, including the cast steel and hydraulic press workshops, are under intense construction day and night.
    Currently, the most prominent feature on the construction site is the caisson project, which looks like building an artificial lake. Five excavators and dozens of trucks, forming a steel giant, have already excavated more than 150,000 cubic meters of earth. Here, a quenching furnace, the largest in China's machinery industry, will be built using the pneumatic caisson method in the future. Near the factory construction site, milky-yellow office buildings, red dormitories, and various warehouses shaped like medium-sized factories are scattered around, numbering no less than two hundred. The prototype of this huge factory has already taken shape.

　　我国最大的一座机械工厂
    富拉尔基重机厂雏型构成
    新华社齐齐哈尔19日电　正在紧张兴建中的我国最大的一座机械工厂——富拉尔基重型机器厂，自从去年6月厂房工程吊起第一根柱子到现在，建厂已经进行了一周年。去年，这里还是一片荒凉的草原；如今，沿着嫩江河畔，新建的红色的雄伟建筑物已毗连成一片，方圆达三、四十里。工程浩大的十六个大厂房，今年普遍动工建设。先行建设的金属结构、辅助、模型等厂房都基本完工，安装工人已经进入厂房安装吊车和设备。铸钢、水压机等四大主厂房的基础打桩工程，正在日夜紧张施工中。
    目前工地上最特出的是沉箱工程，它好像是在建一个人造湖，五台掘土机和几十辆汽车组成的钢铁巨人已挖掘出十五万多土方。在这里，将来还要用气压沉箱方法来建筑一个我国机械工业最大的淬火炉。在厂房工地的近旁，乳黄色的办公大楼、红色的宿舍和形状像中型厂房的各种仓库，星罗棋布，不下二百多座。这个巨大工厂的雏型已经构成了。
