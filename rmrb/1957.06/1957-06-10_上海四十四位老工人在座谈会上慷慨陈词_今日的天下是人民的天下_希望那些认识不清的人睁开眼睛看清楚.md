This Daily Shanghai, June 9th dispatch: Forty-four veteran Shanghai workers who suffered greatly in the old society and have lived happy lives since liberation, today angrily denounced the anti-communist and anti-socialist statements of Ge Peiqi and others at a symposium convened by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and denounced the despicable act of threatening Lu Yuwen with intimidating letters to prevent him from speaking justly.

Today's symposium was filled with an atmosphere of anger, with speakers vying to speak. Labor model and national cutting expert Sheng Li shouted: Our Shanghai working class can no longer tolerate the current anti-communist remarks and despicable acts of writing intimidating letters. We will never allow these people to take advantage of the Party's rectification movement to oppose socialism. We Shanghai workers must implement socialism. We workers understand best that only socialism can develop industry, liberate the working class, and make the country rich and strong.

Many workers indignantly denounced the despicable act of writing anonymous threatening letters, believing that this threatening letter sounded an alarm for the workers, making them more vigilant. Zhu Chengxiang, a worker at the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, said: Lu Yuwen said some fair words at the symposium, and a despicable fellow wrote him a threatening letter. Writing threatening letters is a common trick used by secret agents and bandits to intimidate people in the past. We cannot tolerate this kind of activity. He also said: Ge Peiqi said that "the masses want to kill communists." I don't know who he is referring to when he says "the masses." We can recall that historically, who killed communists? It was imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and landlords. In order to liberate the people, the Communist Party was indeed killed a lot in the past. But today, they will never be able to carry out such a massacre again. The Communist Party now has a very high prestige among the people, and the Party's calls are warmly responded to by the people. The Party has shortcomings in its work, but the Party has the courage to improve. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has recently held many symposiums to accept everyone's correct criticism and is making corrections. We welcome everyone to criticize the Party's work and help correct shortcomings, but we do not allow those people to take the opportunity to spread reactionary remarks. I am not a Communist Party member, but I love the Party and I will always follow the Communist Party.

Huang Jun, an engineer at the Shanghai State No. 4 Cotton Mill, said: I think the threatening letter written to Lu Yuwen has an effect and also has no effect. Its effect is to raise our vigilance and make us aware that some people are now taking advantage of the loopholes in "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to sabotage socialism. It has no effect because everyone knows that this kind of behavior is the most despicable and will never achieve his destructive purpose. He also refuted some of Ge Peiqi's rumors and slanderous remarks, saying: I am a non-Party engineer, and I have been working in the factory for a long time. I have personally seen that the factory's production has increased many times since liberation. I have seen that the vast majority of Party members in the factory are skilled workers in production. They endure hardship first and enjoy later, and they get along very well with us non-Party members. Ge Peiqi's claim that Party members are "plainclothes police" and "disown their relatives" is all nonsense.

At the symposium, workers denounced the remarks of some people who did not want the Party's leadership. They said that now some people say that there is no need for the Party's leadership here, and that the Party's leadership can be withdrawn there. These people have forgotten where our people's victory came from. Zhao Dianming, a crew member of the Peace No. 4 ship, said: They say they don't want the Communist Party's leadership, but we workers say that we must have the Party's leadership. He painfully described the suffering of his family in the old society, where his family was ruined and his family died. He said that if it were not for the Party, he would not have today's happiness. Tie Jianshi, an old worker at the Yangshupu Power Plant, vividly said: The Communist Party is like the fourteen-story building where we are holding the meeting now. There is a forty-foot-thick foundation below the building. Those who harbor malicious intentions cannot move it even a bit.

Many veteran workers used the comparison of life before and after liberation to illustrate the great victory that the people have achieved under the leadership of the Party, refuting the claim by some people that the Party's work is a mess. Wu Liangxian, a worker at the Second Loading and Unloading Area Wharf, said: Some people say that if the Communist Party is destroyed, China will not be destroyed. We workers say: Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Taking our wharf workers as an example, wharf workers before liberation were not as good as dogs. They were subjected to all kinds of insults at the wharf. When unloading goods on foreign ships, no one would pay attention to you. Now, when we load goods on foreign ships, they are particularly polite because we are liberated Chinese workers.

"Chu Anping said that China is now the Party's world, I say that today China is the workers' world, the people's world." This was said by Zhao Guoyi, an old worker at the tram depot. He said angrily: "They say those anti-communist words, I say they are spring radishes, without a heart. I have worked at the tram depot for thirty-seven years. I have suffered all the hardships of the old society and know the sweetness of the new society." Gong Shoupeng, an old worker at the Municipal Telephone Bureau, also gave an example to illustrate whose world it is today. He said: "Before liberation, the telephone bureau was an American-owned telephone company. The Americans treated us Chinese workers as slaves and did not even allow our workers to use their toilets. Now the company is a state-owned enterprise. Recently, a workers' representative meeting was held, and we made many suggestions for improving the work of the enterprise. We workers have truly become the masters." Many workers at the meeting painfully narrated their experiences in the old society and introduced the joy of life after liberation. In the past, they had no money to treat their wives and children, but now they enjoy labor insurance. In the past, their children had no books to read, but now some have entered middle school and university, and some have even become lecturers. In the past, they lived in thatched huts, but now they live in new houses. They also introduced some facts about how Communist Party members care about the masses. Qian Jingan, an old worker at the post office, said: After liberation, he took a three-year and five-month break due to lung disease. He enjoyed labor insurance for a long time, and the Party secretary and others often came to visit him and sent him to a sanatorium. He was often moved to tears. He said: "I am a non-Party member, but the Party did not shut me out. Recently, I was reinstated, and I was assigned an important job position. Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others should not close their eyes and dream. They can come down and see whose world it is today. Qian Jianshi, an old worker at the Yangshupu Power Plant, said: Now some people say that the Communist Party is the least humane. I say that the Communist Party is the most humane. I am retired now, and the factory let my children work in the factory. Would there have been such care for our workers' lives in the past? Who says the Communist Party is not humane? I think it is he himself who has no conscience. Meng Qingyuan, chief engineer of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, also used the development of the Shanghai electric motor industry as an example to illustrate the great achievements of the Party's leadership after liberation. He said: In the past eight years, the people of the whole country have done many things under the leadership of the Party. The Party's cause is truly the cause of the broad masses of the people. For example, in the field of motor manufacturing, it was not valued before liberation and relied on imports. After liberation, motors can be made by ourselves. Before liberation, the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory had only more than 170 people, and it took a lot of effort to make 200 horsepower motors, and it was very difficult to borrow other people's machines. After liberation, like the steam turbine factory, we completed a 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, and now we are also making 25,000-kilowatt ones, and it is going very smoothly. He said that I am a non-Party member, and I have Party members and non-Party members under my leadership. I think Party members are easier to lead because they have fewer ideological problems. Of course, we have also taken detours in our work, but this is inevitable because our foundation is weak. Now the Party has proposed rectification in order to overcome shortcomings. We must not forget our major premise, which is socialism.

The symposium was held in an atmosphere of indignation for more than four hours. The speakers were still vying to speak. Zhang Qi, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions who presided over the meeting, proposed an adjournment several times, but the workers did not agree and wanted to continue talking. Chen Genqi, an old worker at the Jiangnan Shipyard, said angrily: "I have been holding these words in my heart for several days. I know that some of the things I am saying are repeated with what everyone said, but I must say it. If I don't say it today, I won't be able to sleep when I go back." Many people requested that the symposium continue to be held, not only to let the old workers speak, but also to let the middle-aged and young workers speak, because they also have many opinions to say. They also requested that the newspaper should set aside a certain amount of space to allow the workers to express their opinions.

    上海四十四位老工人在座谈会上慷慨陈词
    今日的天下是人民的天下
    希望那些认识不清的人睁开眼睛看清楚
    本报上海9日电　四十四位在旧社会受尽折磨、解放后过着幸福生活的上海老工人，今天在上海市工会联合会召开的座谈会上，愤怒地痛斥葛佩琦等人的反共、反社会主义的言论，痛斥以恐吓信威胁卢郁文不许说公正话的卑劣行径。
    今天的座谈会上充满了愤怒的气氛，发言者争先恐后。劳动模范、全国切削能手盛利大声疾呼地说：我们上海工人阶级对于目前的一些反共言论和写恐吓信的卑鄙行为，再也忍耐不住了，我们决不允许这些人在党开展整风运动的时候来钻空子、反对社会主义，我们上海工人一定要实行社会主义。我们工人最懂得只有社会主义才能发展工业，才能使工人阶级获得解放，国家得到富强。
    许多工人们激愤地痛斥写匿名恐吓信的卑鄙行为，认为这封恐吓信是给工人们敲起了警钟，使他们更加警惕起来。上海第二纺织机械厂工人朱成香说：卢郁文在座谈会上说了些公正话，卑鄙的家伙就写恐吓信给他。写恐吓信是过去特务、土匪吓人的惯技，我们不能容忍这种勾当。他又说：葛佩琦说什么“群众要杀共产党人”，我不知道他所说的“群众”是指谁，我们可以回忆一下，历史上杀共产党的是什么人，是帝国主义、国民党反动派、地主，为了解放人民，共产党过去确实曾被他们杀了不少。但是今天他们再想来屠杀是绝对做不到了。共产党现在在人民中有很高的威信，党的号召都得到人民的热烈响应。党的工作中有缺点，但党有勇气来改进，像上海市委最近召开了许多座谈会，接受大家正确的批评，并且就进行改正。我们欢迎大家对党的工作提出批评，帮助改正缺点，但不允许那些人借机会来散播反动言论。我不是共产党员，但我爱护党，我要永远跟着共产党走。
    上海国棉四厂工程师黄钧说：反动分子写给卢郁文的恐吓信，我觉得起作用，又不起作用。它的作用就是提高了我们的警惕，使我们警觉到现在有些人正在钻“鸣”“放”的空子，来破坏社会主义。不起作用是因为大家都知道这种行为是最卑鄙的，决不能达到他的破坏的目的。他又驳斥了葛佩琦的一些造谣诬蔑的言论，他说：我是一个非党员工程师，在厂里已工作了很长时间，亲眼看到解放后工厂生产提高了许多倍。我看到厂里绝大多数党员都是生产中的能手，他们吃苦在前，享受在后，同我们非党员一起玩乐相处得很好，葛佩琦说什么党员是“便衣警察”，“六亲不认”，全是胡说。
    座谈会上，工人们痛斥了一些人不要党的领导的言论。他们说，现在有些人说这里可以不要党领导，那里党领导可以撤出，这些人忘掉了我们人民的胜利是从那里来的。和平四号轮船员赵殿明说：他们说不要共产党领导，但我们工人说一定要有党的领导。他沉痛地叙述了他的家庭在旧社会时家破人亡的痛苦。他说，如果不是党，他那有今天的幸福。杨树浦发电厂老工人铁剑石形像地说：共产党就像我们现在在开会的这座十四层大楼，楼下有四十尺厚的基础，那些不怀好意的人休想推动它分毫。
    许多老工人用解放前后生活的对比来说明在党的领导下人民所得到的伟大胜利，驳斥某些人所说的党的工作一团糟的说法。第二装卸区码头工人吴良先说：有人说共产党亡了，中国不会亡。我们工人说：没有共产党就没有新中国。拿我们码头工人来说，解放前码头工人不如一条狗，在码头上工作，受尽欺侮。到外国船上卸货，谁来理睬你。现在我们上外国船装货，他们就特别客气，因为我们是解放了的中国工人。
    “储安平说现在中国是党天下，我说今天中国是工人的天下，人民的天下。”这是电车一场老工人赵国义说的，他愤慨地说：“他们讲那些反共的话，我说他们是春天的萝卜，没有心。我在电车场工作了三十七年，我吃尽旧社会的苦，知道新社会的甜。”市电话局老工人龚寿彭也举了个例子，说明今天究竟是谁的天下。他说：“电话局解放前是美商电话公司，美国人把我们中国工人当奴隶，连他们的厕所也不准我们的工人去用。现在公司已是国家企业，最近开了职工代表大会，我们对改善企业工作提了许多意见，我们工人真正成了主人。”许多工人在会上沉痛地叙述了在旧社会时的遭遇，介绍了解放后生活的欢乐，过去没钱给妻儿医病，现在享受了劳保，过去孩子没书念，现在有的进中学、大学，有的还当了讲师。过去住草棚、现在住了新房子。他们还介绍了一些共产党员如何关怀群众的事实，邮局老工人钱静庵说：解放后，他因肺病休养了三年五个月，长期享受劳保，党委书记等还常来探望他，并送他去疗养，他常感动得流泪。他说：“我是一个非党员，党没有把我关在门外，最近我复职了，又给我派了一个重要工作职位。葛佩琦、储安平这些人不要闭了眼说梦话，他们可以下来看看，今天到底是谁的天下。杨树浦发电厂老工人钱剑石说：现在有些人说共产党最不讲人情，我说共产党是最讲人情的。我现在退休了，厂里就让我孩子进厂做工，像这样照顾我们工人生活，过去会有吗？谁说共产党不讲人情，我看就是他自己没有良心。上海电机厂总工程师孟庆元也以上海电机工业的发展为例，说明解放后党的领导的伟大成就，他说；八年来全国人民在党的领导下做了很多事，党的事业真正是广大人民的事业。例如电机制造方面，解放前不被重视，依靠进口，解放后电机已可以自制了。解放前，上海电机厂只有一百七十多人，做二百匹马达用尽了心思，借人家机器非常吃力。解放后，我们和汽轮机厂一样，完成一万二千瓩汽轮发电机，现在二万五千瓩的也正在做，而且非常顺利。他说，我是非党员，我领导下有党员，也有非党员。我觉得党员反而好领导，他们思想问题少。当然，我们工作也走过弯路，但这是不可避免的，因为我们基础薄弱。现在党提出整风，就是为了克服缺点。我们不能忘记我们的大前提，这就是社会主义。
    座谈会在激愤的气氛中进行了四个多小时，发言者仍争先恐后，主持会议的上海市工会联合会副主席张祺几次提出休会，工人们不答应，还要继续谈下去。江南造船厂老工人陈根其气虎虎地说：“这些话我在心里已憋了好些天，有些话我知道和大家说的重复，但我一定要说一说，今天不说出来，回去我睡不着觉。”好些人提出要求继续召开座谈会，不但要让老工人讲，也要让中年、青年工人讲，因为他们也有许多意见要说。他们并要求报纸应当辟出一定的篇幅，让工人们也来鸣一鸣。
