Ministry of Higher Education Issues Notice
　　The Teacher Workload System to be Discontinued on a Trial Basis

(Our newspaper reports) The Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China issued a notice on June 5 regarding the discontinuation of the teacher workload system on a trial basis. The notice stated: "The 'Provisional Measures for Teaching Workload and Working Days of Teachers in Higher Education Institutions' issued by our ministry in July 1955, during the trial period, revealed that some provisions were unrealistic and difficult to implement, especially for teachers in the departments of literature, history, and philosophy. After examination and research, it has been decided to discontinue the trial implementation starting from the 1957-1958 academic year. As for how to calculate teacher staffing and allocate work tasks to various types and levels of teachers in the future, our ministry is currently entrusting several schools to conduct research. After the research has reached a certain stage, it will be distributed to various schools for comments. Before the new method is determined, the schools shall arrange the work of teachers according to the actual situation of each department and teaching and research group."

　　高等教育部发出通知
    将停止试行教师工作量办法
    本报讯　中华人民共和国高等教育部在6月5日发出了关于停止试行教师工作量办法的通知。通知中说：我部1955年7月发布的“高等学校教师教学工作量和工作日试行办法”，在试行期间，发现有些规定有不切实际之处，对文史系科等方面的教师更难于实行。现经检查研究后，决定自1957—1958年度起停止试行。至于今后如何计算教师编制和分配各类各级教师工作任务的问题，我部正在委托若干学校进行研究。俟研究告一段落后，即发给各校征求意见。在新办法尚未确定之前，由各校根据各系各教研组的实际情况安排教师的工作。
