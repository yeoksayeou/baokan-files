Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 21st: The joint statement of the German Socialist Unity Party and the Polish United Workers' Party, published here today, stated that the delegations of the two parties conducted a wide-ranging exchange of views on the current international situation, issues of the international workers' movement, and issues related to the two parties' struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The joint statement pointed out that all conspiracies attempting to create distrust between the two parties, between Poland and the German Democratic Republic, and between the peoples of the two countries are hopeless. The two parties believe that in order to build socialism and ensure peace, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity, friendship, and fraternal cooperation between socialist countries. The two parties firmly oppose all conspiracies that attempt to weaken this unity and cooperation through anti-Soviet incitement.

The joint statement said: The historic achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great achievements of the Communist Party of China, and the valuable contributions of all Communist and Workers' Parties are the common property of the knowledge and experience of the workers' movement.

The great upsurge in the international workers' movement in recent times is conducive to the mutual exchange of experience and the creative development of Marxism-Leninism. The German Socialist Unity Party and the Polish United Workers' Party highly value the significance of this exchange of experience.

The joint statement emphasized that all fraternal countries consider the following principles to be commonly effective in socialist construction: the dictatorship of the proletariat allied with the working peasantry, the leading role of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist parties, the development of productive forces on the basis of the socialization of the means of production, central planning, and solidarity with socialist countries . These principles should be applied creatively, taking into account the historical conditions and national characteristics of each country. It is therefore necessary and possible to adopt unique forms and methods when building socialism in each country.

The Polish United Workers' Party supports the German Socialist Unity Party's struggle for German reunification. It believes that German reunification is a matter for the German people themselves.

The joint statement concluded: "The representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party and the Polish United Workers' Party noted with satisfaction that this meeting has brought the relations between the two parties closer and contributed to complete mutual understanding between the two parties. In order to enhance and expand cooperative relations, it has been agreed to exchange party delegations to study each other's experience in party work. The two parties will exchange views on all important issues of mutual interest."

　　德波两党联合声明
    决定进一步加强兄弟合作
    新华社柏林21日电　今天在这里发表的德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党的联合声明说，两党代表团就当前的国际形势、国际工人运动问题和有关两党争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的问题进行了广泛的意见交换。
    联合声明指出，所有企图在两党之间、在波兰和德意志民主共和国两国之间以及在两国人民之间制造不信任的阴谋，都是毫无希望的。两党认为，为了建设社会主义和使和平获得保证，有必要进一步加强社会主义国家之间的团结、友谊和兄弟合作。两党坚决反对一切企图通过反苏挑拨来削弱这种团结和合作的阴谋。
    联合声明说：苏联共产党的历史性业迹、中国共产党的伟大成就和所有共产党和工人党的宝贵贡献，是工人运动的知识和经验中的共同财产。
    最近期间在国际工人运动中出现的伟大高潮，有助于相互交流经验和创造性地发展马克思列宁主义。德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党非常珍视这种经验交流的意义。
    联合声明强调指出，所有兄弟国家在社会主义建设中认为下列原则是共同有效的，即：同劳动农民联盟的无产阶级专政，工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，在生产资料社会化的基础上发展生产力，中央计划性和同社会主义国家的团结。这些原则应该在照顾每一国家的历史条件和民族特点的情况下，作创造性的应用。因此，有必要和可能在每一个国家建设社会主义的时候采用特有的形式和方式。
    波兰统一工人党支持德国统一社会党的争取德国统一的斗争。它认为，德国统一是德国人民自己的事情。
    联合声明最后说：“德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党的代表满意地指出，这一次会谈使两党的关系更为紧密，并且有助于两党之间的完全相互谅解。为了增进和扩大合作关系已经协议交换派遣党的代表团以便相互研究党的工作经验。两党将就与双方利益有关的一切重要问题交换意见。”
