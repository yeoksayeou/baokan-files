Xinhua News Agency, 12th: On the evening of the 10th, members of the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Taihang Mountains, Shanxi Province, expressed their opinions one after another, refuting Ge Peiqi's fallacies. Everyone said that before liberation, Xigou Township farmers worked hard all year to produce grain, half of which was paid in rent and taxes. One person could not eat 200 jin of grain a year, and seven out of ten households relied on bran and vegetables for half the year. Last year, the state's unified purchase and collection of grain accounted for only 8% of the total output. The average amount of food per person, large and small, in the township was 390 jin, nearly double that before liberation. Can it be said that life has not improved? Before liberation, there was not a single live pig in Xigou Township, but now there are 450. In addition to selling 79, each person averages 2.5 to 3 jin of pork during the New Year and festivals. Can it be said that unified purchase and sales have ruined the farmers' desire to raise pigs? When it came to the relationship between the Communist Party and the people, Zhang Wangxing, a usually taciturn cooperative member, said, "The Kuomintang before liberation was hundreds of thousands of miles away from us; the Communist Party has always been with us. In my opinion, Party members and cadres work during the day and at night, and their lives are even harder than those of the cooperative members!"

　　离我们十万八千里的是国民党
　　共产党和我们从来就在一起
    据新华社12日讯　山西省太行山区平顺县西沟乡金星农林牧生产合作社社员在10日晚上纷纷发表意见，驳斥葛佩琦的谬论。大家说，解放前，西沟乡农民辛劳一年生产的粮食，有一半交租纳税，一个人一年吃不到二百斤粮食，十户里头有七户是糠菜半年粮。去年，国家统购征收的粮食只占总产量的8％，全乡大小口每人平均三百九十斤，食粮比解放前增加近一倍，这能说生活没有改善吗？解放前西沟乡一口活猪也没有，现在有四百五十口，除了卖出七十九口以外，过年过节每人平均二斤半到三斤猪肉，这能叫统购统销搞糟了农民不愿养猪吗？提到共产党和人民的关系，从来沉默寡言的社员张旺兴说：“离我们十万八千里的是解放前的国民党；共产党和我们从来就在一起。我看，党员干部白天劳动黑夜工作，比社员生活得还艰苦哩！”
