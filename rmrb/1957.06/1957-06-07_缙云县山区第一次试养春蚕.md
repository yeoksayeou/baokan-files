    The First Trial Cultivation of Spring Silkworms in Mountainous Areas of Jinyun County
    (Our Newspaper) News: This year, Heyang Agricultural Cooperative in Bihe Township, Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, tried raising two sheets of silkworm eggs, producing a total of 176 jin of cocoons, averaging 88 jin per sheet, approaching the highest record of spring silkworm production in Zhejiang Province last year (averaging 91 jin of cocoons per sheet).
    In the past, Jinyun County had not raised silkworms. Last year, the government called on mountainous areas to develop the sericulture industry. This cooperative planted more than 40,000 mulberry seedlings. This spring, under the guidance of technical cadres, they successfully adopted the rapid silkworm rearing method in the trial cultivation. (Chen Zhengtao)

    缙云县山区第一次试养春蚕
    本报讯　浙江缙云县碧河乡河阳农业社今年试养二张蚕种，共产茧一百七十六斤，平均每张八十八斤，接近去年浙江省春蚕最高纪录（平均每张收茧九十一斤）。
    过去缙云县没有养过蚕，去年政府号召山区发展蚕桑事业，这个社就栽下四万多株桑苗，今春他们在技术干部的指导下采用了快速养蚕法试养成功。　（陈正涛）
