After a day and a half of group discussions, the National Conference of Employee Family Representatives began plenary speeches today.

Speakers at today's meeting included: Zhou Chunjiao, a family member of a Wuhan Jiang'an District Railway Station porter; Wang Peizhen, Deputy Director of the Family Committee of the Shouwangfen Mine in Chengde City, Hebei Province; Xu Yihui, wife of Wang Wencui, an engineer from the Taiyuan Construction Engineering Bureau, representing Shanghai families; Wang Yuhuan, a family member of a worker at the Harbin Metal Structure Factory; Nishakhan, a Uyghur employee family member; Zhang Jinfeng, Director of the Family Committee of the Qingdao Shuangfu Flour Mill; Sun Ruizhi, Director of the Beifengwo Family Committee of the Beijing Railway Administration; and Wang Xiulan, a family representative of the Anshan Refractory Materials Factory. Most representatives spoke about the role of frugality, managing the household well, harmony, and unity in socialist construction. They used many facts from their own experiences to illustrate that housework is not only important but also glorious.

Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Li Dequan, Minister of Health, also spoke at today's meeting. Xie Juezai said that the work of family members not only helped workers in socialist construction, but also greatly helped the residents. In the neighborhood, wherever there are worker family members, they become the core of uniting the residents. He also encouraged the representatives to overcome shortcomings, strive for progress, and do ordinary but extraordinary work, not to disappoint the expectations of the working class, and not to disappoint the expectations of women across the country, especially urban residents and women. Li Dequan focused on discussing issues such as carrying out patriotic health campaigns, family planning, and cultivating children's hygiene habits with the representatives.
