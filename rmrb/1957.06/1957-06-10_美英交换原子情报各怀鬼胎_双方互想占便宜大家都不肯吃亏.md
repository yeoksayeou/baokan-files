　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: British and American atomic energy officials recently held talks.

　　It is revealed that the main topic of these talks was the exchange of atomic energy intelligence between the two countries. Britain hopes to obtain information on the operation of the American atomic submarine "Seawolf" and data on pressurized water reactors. The United States wants to understand the complete blueprints of the British Calder Hall atomic power station.

　　Differences soon arose between the two sides during the talks because Britain was reluctant to provide information on the Calder Hall power station. Britain fears that if the United States understands the information that it paid to acquire, it will put American companies in a more advantageous position than British companies in the competition.

　　The announcement issued at the end of the talks stated that the two sides had "reached agreement" on some issues. However, many British industrialists and scientists immediately expressed their opposition to exchanging atomic energy intelligence with the United States, believing that this would only benefit the United States, which lags behind Britain in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

　　Many Britons pointed out that the United States' desire to understand the Calder Hall power station's data contrasts sharply with the bad things they said in Japan a few days ago. American atomic energy officials once said that the equipment at the British Calder Hall power station was expensive, bulky, and inefficient.

　　Currently, there is fierce competition between Britain and the United States in the export of atomic energy equipment.

    美英交换原子情报各怀鬼胎
    双方互想占便宜大家都不肯吃亏
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：英国和美国原子能负责人最近举行了会谈。
    据透露，这次会谈主要讨论交换两国原子能情报问题。英国希望获得美国原子能潜水艇“舡鱼号”操作的情况和水压反应堆的资料，美国要了解英国考尔德霍尔原子能发电站的全部蓝图。
    会谈不久双方就发生了分歧，原因是英国迟迟不愿提供考尔德霍尔发电站的资料。英国怕出钱买来的情报让美国了解以后，会使美国公司在竞争中处于比英国公司更有利的地位。
    会谈结束时发表的公告说，双方在一些问题上“达成了协议”。但是，英国许多工业家和科学家立即表示反对跟美国交换原子能情报，认为这只能使在和平利用原子能方面落后于英国的美国占便宜。
    许多英国人指出，美国要了解考尔德霍尔发电站资料，与他们前些日子在日本所说的坏话，形成了对照。美国原子能负责人曾经说，英国考尔德霍尔发电站的设备是昂贵的、笨重的和效率不高的。
    目前，在发展原子能的设备的出口方面，英国和美国存在着剧烈的竞争。
