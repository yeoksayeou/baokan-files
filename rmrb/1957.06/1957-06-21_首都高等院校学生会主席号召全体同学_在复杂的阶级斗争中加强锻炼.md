Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The chairmen of the student unions of twenty-eight universities and colleges in the capital stated at today's gathering that they would draw a clear line between themselves and the right-wing elements, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely launch a struggle against the right-wing elements.

Many university and college student union chairmen passionately conveyed the determination of university students to launch a struggle against the right-wing elements. Zhao Zhenjiang, chairman of the Peking University Student Union, said, "We still remember the 'December 9th' Movement, when the Kuomintang reactionaries suppressed the students' democratic and patriotic movement under the pretext of 'patriotism is a crime.' The Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek Group were all traitorous governments. Only after the Communist Party led the people of the whole country to achieve revolutionary victory did we have such a comfortable study life today. Now, the right-wing elements are spreading fallacies against the Party and against socialism, attempting to find their 'market' among students, but this conspiracy has failed."

Tan Haoqiang, chairman of the Tsinghua University Student Union, said, "This time, the students' resolute struggle against the right-wing elements is the most profound education for the broad masses of students since liberation, allowing us to see that there are many loyal revolutionaries in society, as well as a small number of ambitious right-wing elements." He said, "The right-wing elements see that our young students lack experience in class struggle, and that many of our classmates come from exploiting-class families. They want to use these weaknesses to seek their supporters among our young students. However, their fantasies are being shattered by the facts. Our broad masses of students must repel the frantic attacks of the right-wing elements and resolutely become the reserve force of the working class."

Ge Gerihu, chairman of the Central Institute for Nationalities Student Union, representing the 2,400 students of more than 50 ethnic groups in their college, said, "We young people of all ethnic groups have learned from our own experiences that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no such beautiful study life today. We must study Chairman Mao's report 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People' well, resolutely counter the fallacies of the right-wing elements, and raise our class consciousness."

The chairmen of the student unions of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Physical Education, Beijing Mining Institute, and Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration all expressed their determination to follow the Party and draw a clear line between themselves and the reactionary thoughts of the right-wing elements, and use labor to build a beautiful socialist society.

Wan Taihe, chairman of the Beijing Students' Federation, also spoke at the meeting. He hoped that the broad masses of students would study and discuss Chairman Mao's report well, arm their minds, distinguish between right and wrong, and be tempered in this sharp and complex class struggle.

Hu Qili, chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, spoke last. He said, "The attempt of the bourgeois right-wing elements to exploit the weaknesses of students in their thinking, to exploit the weaknesses of students who lack knowledge of class struggle and social experience, to spread fallacies, and to provoke and incite, hoping to find their reserve force among students has gone bankrupt. There are 'bad apples' among the students, but they are a very small minority. These people have a complete set of anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and behaviors, which have caused a certain degree of ideological confusion among some students. However, now that teachers and students in schools and all sectors of society have launched a profound criticism of these fallacies and erroneous actions, the ideological awareness of all students will be greatly improved, thereby further strengthening the unity of all teachers and students." He then pointed out, "There are still a considerable number of people among the students who generally support the Party and approve of socialism, but due to one-sided thinking and extreme emotions, they have not analyzed specific issues and lack vigilance against reactionary words and deeds. Therefore, they sometimes lose their way and are fooled by the right-wing elements. We must do our best to help such students and have cordial discussions with them. As long as we explain the principles clearly, they can easily wake up and learn from it." Hu Qili hoped that the broad masses of students would study Chairman Mao's report well, unite closely around the Party, actively and consciously temper themselves in this storm, and become a loyal intellectual worker serving the cause of socialism.

　　首都高等院校学生会主席号召全体同学
    在复杂的阶级斗争中加强锻炼
    据新华社20日讯　首都二十八个高等院校学生会的主席在今天的集会上，一致表示要同右派分子划清界限，在共产党的领导下，坚决向右派分子展开斗争。
    许多院校的学生会主席在会上慷慨激昂地传达了大学生们向右派分子展开斗争的决心。北京大学学生会主席赵震江说，我们还记得“一二·九”运动时，国民党反动派以“爱国有罪”镇压学生的民主爱国运动。清朝政府、北洋军阀、蒋介石集团都是卖国政府。只有在共产党领导全国人民取得革命胜利后，我们才有今天这样安适的学习生活。现在，右派分子发出反党反社会主义的谬论，企图在学生中找寻他们的“市场”，但是这个阴谋失败了。
    清华大学学生会主席谭浩强说，这次同学们向右派分子展开坚决的斗争，是解放以来对广大学生的一次最深刻的教育，使我们看到社会上有许许多多忠心耿耿的革命者，也还有少数右派分子的野心家。他说，右派分子看到我们青年学生缺乏阶级斗争的经验，看到我们很多同学出身于剥削阶级家庭，他们想利用这些弱点在我们青年学生中搜罗他们的支持者，但是，他们的幻想正在被事实粉碎着，我们广大的学生一定要击退右派分子的猖狂进攻，坚决作工人阶级的后备军。
    中央民族学院学生会主席葛格日呼代表他们学院五十多个民族的二千四百个同学说，我们各民族青年都从亲身的经历体会到没有共产党的领导，就没有今天这样美好的学习生活。我们要好好学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，坚决反击右派分子的谬论，提高阶级觉悟。
    北京航空学院、北京体育学院、北京矿业学院、北京地质勘探学院等院校学生会主席都表示坚决跟着党走，一定要与右派分子的反动思想划清界限，用劳动建设美好的社会主义社会。
    北京市学生联合会主席万泰和也在会上发言。他希望广大同学很好地学习、讨论毛主席的报告，武装自己的头脑，明辨是非，在这次尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中得到锻炼。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立最后发言。他说：“资产阶级右派分子企图利用学生在思想上的弱点，利用学生缺乏阶级斗争知识和社会经验的弱点，散布谬论，挑拨煽动，想在学生中找到他们的后备军的希望是破产了。同学中的“害群之马”是有的，但这是极少数。这些人有成套的反党、反社会主义的言论行为，已在一部分同学中造成了某种程度的思想混乱。但是，现在当学校师生和社会各界对这些谬论和错误行动展开深刻的批判以后，全体同学的思想觉悟就必将大大提高一步，从而进一步加强全体师生的团结。他接着指出：“在同学中还有相当数量的人，他们一般是拥护党和赞成社会主义的，但由于思想片面和偏激情绪，对具体问题没有分析，对反动言行缺乏警惕，因而，有时就迷失了方向，上了右派分子的当。对于这样的同学，我们要尽力地帮助他们，亲切地和他们进行共同的讨论，只要讲清道理，他们是很容易清醒起来的并且可以从中取得教训。胡启立希望广大同学努力学好毛主席的报告，紧密地团结在党的周围，在这次风浪中积极的自觉的锻炼自己，成为一个为社会主义事业忠诚服务的劳动知识分子。
