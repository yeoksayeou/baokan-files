Xinhua News Agency, June 1st Dispatch from Paris: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on May 31st that France's view "agrees" with Britain's on the point that trade with China should be relaxed. However, on the specific approach to relaxing trade restrictions, France is willing to have "allies" make a "consistent" decision.

French political figures have indicated that France is not prepared to immediately follow Britain's example. They pointed out that the outgoing Mollet cabinet cannot make such an important decision. This decision must be left to the new government.

"Les Échos" wrote that France very much hopes to obtain "freedom of action," but it is also worried about causing displeasure from the United States, while France still often has to need financial "aid" from the United States.

    法国表示同英国看法一致
    要等新政府成立再做定夺
    新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人5月31日声明说，在对中国贸易应该放宽这一点上，法国跟英国的看法“一致”，但是在放宽贸易限制的具体做法上，法国愿意由“盟国”作出“一致”决定。
    法国政界人士表示，法国目前还不准备立即效法英国。他们指出，即将下台的摩勒内阁不能作出这样重要的决定。这一决定必须留待新政府来作。
    “回声报”写道，法国十分希望获得“行动自由”，但是它又担心会引起美国的不满，而法国还不得不常常需要美国的财政“援助”。
