　　National Rapeseed Production Expected to Reach 20 Million Dan
　　Approximately 3 Million Dan More Than Last Year, Approaching This Year's Production Increase Plan

　　(Our report) According to estimations by agricultural departments, the total national winter-sown rapeseed production this year may reach 20 million dan. This production is approximately 3 million dan more than last year, approaching this year's planned production increase.

　　Most winter-sown rapeseed production areas have achieved varying degrees of increase in production. Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have increased rapeseed production by approximately 1.6 million dan this year. Hubei province, based on post-harvest estimates, has more than doubled its production compared to last year. Zhejiang province's total production this year may reach over 1.6 million dan, an increase of more than 300,000 dan compared to last year. Jiangsu has increased production by more than 50% compared to last year. Fujian has increased production by 15% compared to last year. Due to excessively late sowing last winter and drought and frost damage, the rapeseed in Anhui province did not grow well, and the actual rapeseed harvest this year is only 60% of the planned production; however, the rapeseed harvest in areas not affected by disasters is still very good.

　　Judging from the rapeseed harvest situation in various regions, the excellent characteristics of "Victory Rapeseed" are still very prominent. The per-mu yield of Sichuan province's 2 million mu of "Victory Rapeseed" is as high as 250 jin and as low as around 150 jin. According to a survey by the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Department, the average per-mu yield of "Victory Rapeseed" in the Jinhua area is 200 jin.

　　全国可收油菜籽两千万担
　　比去年约多三百万担　接近今年增产计划
    本报讯　根据农业部门估算，今年全国冬播油菜籽总产量可以达到两千万担。这个产量比去年多三百万担左右，接近今年的预计增产计划。
    各冬播油菜籽产区大都得到不同程度的增产。四川、贵州、云南三省今年增产油菜籽约一百六十万担。湖北省根据收打后的估计，今年比去年增产一倍多。浙江省今年的总产量可到一百六十万担以上，比去年多收三十万担多。江苏比去年增产五成以上。福建比去年增产一成半。安徽省的油菜由于去冬播得过晚和遭受旱、冻灾害，生长不好，今年油菜籽的实收量仅有计划产量的六成；但没有受灾地区的油菜籽收成还是很好。
    从各地油菜籽收获情况看，“胜利油菜”的优良特性依然表现得很突出。四川省的二百万亩“胜利油菜”的每亩产量，高的有二百五十斤，低的也有一百五十斤上下。据浙江省农业部门调查，金华专区的“胜利油菜”平均每亩可收二百斤。
