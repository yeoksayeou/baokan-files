Editorial

    The representatives of various countries of the World Peace Council are scheduled to gather in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, today to discuss major issues of promoting peace and easing international tensions. This is the first time the World Peace Council has met in Asia, and the people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries, attach great importance to this meeting. The people of our country warmly support the convening of the Colombo meeting and wish the meeting a success.
    In the post-war years, the world peace movement has continuously achieved brilliant results. The efforts of peace-loving people in various countries to strive for peace have repeatedly stopped worrying flames of war, and after the failure of the imperialist war of aggression against Egypt, the international situation has re-emerged with a trend of easing. However, today the people of all countries still live in unease. The imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are engaged in an atomic arms race, and the tentacles of neo-colonialism extending to Asia, Africa, and Latin America seriously threaten the safety, independence, and peaceful lives of the people of all countries. This situation requires further strengthening the world peace movement and strengthening the unity of peaceful forces to promote peace and realize the desire of the people of all countries to fully control their own destiny.
    The most common call of the people of all countries at present is to demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and the immediate cessation of hydrogen bomb tests. Because this is a matter of the lives and safety of the people of all countries, and it is also a matter of whether the world moves towards progress and prosperity or falls into terror and regression. At present, the movement to demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and the immediate cessation of hydrogen bomb tests is unfolding widely around the world, but it has not yet formed a sufficiently strong force. The United States is still making every effort to expand its atomic military strength and refuses to give up nuclear weapons testing. Under such circumstances, the people of all countries must continue to mobilize extensively and invest all kinds of social forces in this movement in order to force the U.S. government to finally comply with the will of the people.
    World opinion is now focused on the disarmament talks being held in London. The people of all countries demand that the London Conference be able to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, especially on the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and stopping hydrogen bomb tests. The Soviet Union's proposal on April 30 is in line with this desire of the people of all countries. However, there are many signs that the United States is still attempting to delay and obstruct. The people of all countries are closely watching the attitude of the United States.
    Colonialism is a source of war threats. Therefore, the struggle to promote peace and ease international tensions is also bound to point to anti-colonialism. The convening of the World Peace Council in Asia is a great support for the people of Asian and African countries who are struggling to maintain national independence. Now, the most important enemy on the road to independent development for the people of Asian and African countries and the people of Latin American countries is the new colonialism of the United States. The American aggressor groups are marching towards vast areas of Asia and Africa under the banner of the Eisenhower Doctrine, in an attempt to squeeze out the increasingly declining old colonial forces in this region, suppress the national independence movements in this region, and impose American neo-colonialism on the people of this region. At the same time, the United States is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and vainly attempting to realize its long-term ambition to divide our country by engaging in the conspiracy of "two Chinas." In the Asian and African regions, there is still the colonial war waged by French colonialists against the Algerian people; part of the territory of India and Indonesia is still occupied by colonial countries. In order to deepen its control over Latin American countries, the United States is constantly creating coups and carrying out subversion activities, placing that region in turmoil. In order to safeguard the noble cause of world peace, peace-loving people of all countries must continue to wage a resolute struggle against colonialism, especially the new colonialism of the United States, in order to eradicate this scourge in the world and clear the important obstacles on the road to lasting peace.
    Under the efforts of the world's peace forces, the international situation has gradually tended to ease. In order to further develop this trend of easing, it is also necessary to continue to carry forward the spirit of the Geneva Conference and the Asian-African Conference to promote peaceful cooperation among countries. To this end, public opinion in many countries has put forward the proposal of holding a conference of major powers; social forces in European countries are working to establish a European collective security system; and economic and cultural exchanges between Eastern and Western countries are also being further developed. These good wishes and beneficial developments will receive the full support of peace-loving people in all countries.
    The decisive force in promoting world peace and easing international tensions is the peace will of the people of all countries. The Colombo meeting of the World Peace Council will enable the people of all countries to express their common aspirations and enable them to find a common language on major issues in promoting the cause of peace. Further unity of the people of all countries on common aspirations can generate new strength to promote the world peace movement to continue to move forward.

### 进一步加强世界和平运动

    进一步加强世界和平运动
    世界和平理事会的各国代表定于今天在锡兰首都科伦坡集会，讨论促进和平和缓和国际局势的重大问题。这是世界和平理事会第一次在亚洲集会，全世界人民，特别是亚洲各国人民十分重视这次会议。我国人民热烈支持科伦坡会议的召开，并预祝会议成功。
    在战后年代中，世界和平运动曾不断取得辉煌的成果。各国爱好和平人民争取和平的努力，已数度使令人担心的战火停熄，并且在帝国主义侵埃战争失败之后，使国际局势重新出现了和缓的趋势。但是，今天各国人民依然生活在不安之中。以美国为首的帝国主义国家实行原子军备竞赛，向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲伸张的新殖民主义的魔手，严重地威胁着各国人民的安全、独立和安静的生活。这种情势要求进一步加强世界和平运动，加强和平力量的团结，来促进和平和实现各国人民完全掌握自己命运的愿望。
    当前各国人民最普遍的呼声，就是要求禁止使用原子武器和立即停止氢弹试验。因为这是关系着各国人民生命和安全的问题，也是关系着世界走向进步和繁荣还是陷入恐怖和倒退的问题。目前，要求禁止使用原子武器和立即停止氢弹试验的运动，正在世界各地广泛展开，但是至今还没有形成足够的强大的力量。美国仍在竭力扩充原子军备，并且不肯放弃核武器的试验。在这种情况下，各国人民还必须继续广泛地动员起来，把各种社会力量投入这一运动，以便迫使美国政府最后顺从人民的意愿。
    世界舆论的注意力现在正集中在伦敦举行的裁军谈判上。各国人民要求伦敦会议对裁军问题特别是关于禁止使用原子武器和停止氢弹试验问题能够达成协议。苏联4月30日提出的建议，是符合各国人民的这种愿望的。但是，有许多迹象显示，美国仍然企图进行拖延和阻挠。各国人民正密切注意着美国的态度。
    殖民主义是战争威胁的一个根源。因此，促进和平和缓和国际局势的斗争，也必然指向着反对殖民主义。这次世界和平理事会在亚洲召开，就是对为维护民族独立而斗争的亚非各国人民的巨大支持。现在，在亚非各国人民以及拉丁美洲各国人民独立发展道路上的最主要的敌人，是美国的新殖民主义。美国侵略集团正在打着艾森豪威尔主义的旗帜，向亚洲和非洲的广大地区进军，以图排挤掉在这个地区日益没落的旧殖民主义势力，镇压这个地区的民族独立运动，把美国的新殖民主义强加在这个地区各国人民的头上。与此同时，美国还侵占着我国的领土台湾，并妄想通过搞“两个中国”的阴谋，以实现它的长期分割我国领土的野心。在亚非地区还存在着法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚人民所进行的殖民战争；印度和印度尼西亚的一部分领土也还被殖民国家霸占着。美国为了加深对拉丁美洲各国的控制，正在不断制造政变和进行颠覆活动，使那个地区处在动荡不安之中。为了维护世界和平的崇高事业，各国爱好和平人民必须继续向殖民主义，特别是美国的新殖民主义进行坚决的斗争，以根除世界上的这种祸害，并扫清走向持久和平道路上的重要障碍。
    在世界和平力量的努力下，国际局势已经逐渐趋向缓和。为了使这种和缓的趋势得到进一步的发展，还必须继续发扬日内瓦会议和亚非会议的精神，来促进各国间的和平合作。为此，许多国家的舆论已经提出了举行大国会议的主张；欧洲国家的社会力量正在为建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力；东西方国家间的经济和文化交流也在进一步开展。这些善良的愿望和有益的发展，都会得到各国爱好和平人民的全力支持。
    促进世界和平和缓和国际局势的决定性的力量，是各国人民的和平意志。世界和平理事会的科伦坡会议，将使各国人民能够表达他们的共同愿望，并且使他们在促进和平事业的各项重大问题上找到共同的语言。各国人民在共同的愿望上的进一步团结，就能够产生新的力量，来推动世界和平运动继续向前发展。
