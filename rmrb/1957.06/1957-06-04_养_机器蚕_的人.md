    The Man Who Raises "Machine Silkworms"
    Chen Dianmo
    An Ideal of Nineteen Years Ago

    In Shanghai's Nanjing Road, there's an alley called Jing'an Villa. This alley is home to a "silkworm raiser." But the silkworms he raises aren't ordinary ones; they're "machine silkworms" capable of spinning over 20,000 meters of silk per minute.

    This "silkworm raiser" is named Cheng Weimin. The story of how he raised this "machine silkworm" goes back nineteen years. At that time, Cheng Weimin was only fifteen years old and studying in middle school. He loved raising silkworms. His family called him "Silkworm Fanatic."

    One day, the "Silkworm Fanatic" read an article about fiberglass in a magazine, saying that this fiber was finer than silk and could be woven into glass cloth as transparent and lustrous as cicada wings, and the clothes made from it were lighter than silk. This sparked his great interest.

    From that day on, Cheng Weimin ate one less pancake every morning and saved the money to buy materials for experiments. At the same time, he worked especially hard to study chemistry, physics, and other subjects.

    After finishing high school, many classmates went to university, but he couldn't afford it due to family financial difficulties. In order to continue researching and trial-producing fiberglass, he went to Jiaotong University to audit classes at night, increasing his knowledge of chemistry and physics. When he found a job as a bank clerk and his life became slightly more stable, he saved some money to buy experimental materials and borrowed a gas lamp to continue his research. Countless failures did not shake his confidence. In 1946, he designed and successfully built an electric heating crucible for melting glass and trial-produced primary fiberglass. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only did no one care about this scientific achievement, but he was also extorted by the reactionary government under the pretext of "manufacturing military supplies." From then on, this young scientific researcher had no choice but to leave his beloved "home laboratory" and roam the streets repairing bicycles for people.

    The sunshine of the Communist Party finally dispelled the shadow lingering in Cheng Weimin's heart. Soon after Shanghai's liberation, an official from the national industrial sector found Cheng Weimin. He immediately participated in the construction of China's first fiberglass factory—the Sme Glass Fiber Factory. Later, he became an engineer in this factory. This factory produced primary fiberglass, which was not only coarse but also easily broken, and could only be used for general insulation and heat insulation materials. In June of last year, the Shanghai Electrical Appliances and Telecommunications Industry Company assigned Cheng Weimin a task to trial-produce advanced fiberglass in a short period of time and gave him 10,000 yuan for experimental expenses. Cheng Weimin temporarily left the factory and returned to his home laboratory.

    Ten Thousand Yuan and Two Cents

    The most important problem in trial-producing advanced glass is to improve the heat resistance of the fiberglass. Primary fiberglass only has a heat resistance of 800 degrees Celsius, while advanced fiberglass needs to reach 1500 degrees Celsius. According to foreign technical data, the crucibles for melting glass are all made of high-temperature resistant platinum. Cheng Weimin went to a mechanical parts store to buy this kind of crucible. The clerk who received him asked him how many grams he needed.

    "How can a few grams do! It needs to be at least 700 grams." Cheng Weimin said, handing him the drawing.

    The clerk shook his head with a surprised look, saying, "I've never heard of such a heavy platinum crucible."

    "How much is it per gram?"

    "Twenty-four yuan. The heaviest one we have here is only sixty grams."

    Cheng Weimin returned home and reduced the size of the originally designed platinum crucible, reducing the weight to only 450 grams, preparing to ask the mechanical parts store to think of a solution. He stepped out the door, but then turned back into the house. He thought: even if the store could find a way to solve this problem and advanced fiberglass could be successfully manufactured in a short period of time, when building a factory for mass production in the future, more than a hundred platinum crucibles would be needed, which would require a large investment from the state; moreover, where could so much platinum be found? Aren't some countries limited in the mass production of fiberglass because of a shortage of platinum! Some people advised him that research and experimentation couldn't always be about pinching pennies; money always has to be spent. Cheng Weimin knew in his heart that if he wrote a report and asked the state for money to buy a platinum crucible, there wouldn't be any major problems, especially since the bank still had the 10,000 yuan in experimental expenses given to him by the industrial sector. However, he was unwilling to take this easy but expensive route.

    A few days later, he came to the mechanical parts store again. He wanted to buy silicon carbide rods, which are also a high-temperature resistant material. However, each of these rods cost 15 yuan and was imported. He decided not to buy them.

    Like a car encountering a red light at a crosswalk, Cheng Weimin's experimental work temporarily came to a halt. He spent his days with a worried look on his face, holding several foreign technical books in his hands, silently reading them, and couldn't help but say to himself: "Foreign countries all use platinum crucibles to make fiberglass, this is authoritative! Can we not use them?"

    "I don't think foreign technical data is necessarily sacrosanct. Maybe we can create a new method." His wife, who was also his assistant, Wan Benyi, interjected. She also advised him not to always bury himself in books, but to consult others.

    In the furnace room of a glass factory. The thermometer on the wall pointed to over 120 degrees Celsius. Several red-hot openings spewed flames from the furnace, which stood half a person high above the ground. Cheng Weimin stood here and, taking advantage of the workers' break, asked an old worker: "Master, how high is the temperature of this furnace?"

    "I don't know, roughly estimated, it's about 1400 or 1500 degrees."

    "How can this furnace withstand such high temperatures?"

    "It's made of clay, the more it's burned, the stronger it becomes!"

    After hearing these words, Cheng Weimin pondered for a while, revealing a smile that hadn't been seen for many days, and rushed home.

    A pile of gray clay was placed on the table. Cheng Weimin and Wan Benyi, like masters at a pancake stand, used smooth wooden sticks to roll the clay back and forth, getting mud splattered all over themselves.

    That day, Cheng Weimin felt much lighter and slept soundly that night. Because the crucible was successfully made, it marked the first shot in the effort to manufacture advanced fiberglass. Moreover, a crucible made of clay only costs two cents, while a platinum crucible costs more than 10,000 yuan.

    An Amazing Achievement

    On March 20th of this year, after I learned that Cheng Weimin had woven glass silk into cloth tape and made ropes, I went to congratulate him.

    As soon as I stepped into his small home laboratory, I was amazed by the scene before me. I remembered that when I came here a few months ago, the room was empty, but now it was filled with machines. A melting furnace was placed against the wall; a weaving machine the size of a small square table, similar in style to the rural foot-operated weaving machine, was installed in the center of the room; a plying machine and a sizing machine were placed in front of the window. These machines were all assembled from old parts. Only a little more than 2,000 yuan of the 10,000 yuan in experimental expenses given to him by the industrial sector had been used. A secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and several responsible comrades from the central industrial sector had visited this home laboratory. After they saw these machines and the clay crucible that replaced the expensive platinum crucible, they praised Cheng Weimin's wisdom and his spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift.

    We came to the melting furnace, called the "machine silkworm," which was sleeping against the wall. Cheng Weimin pressed a button installed on the wall, and immediately, the "machine silkworm" started to roar. A few minutes later, the clay crucible on the "machine silkworm's" head was burned red. Cheng Weimin picked up the raw material for making advanced fiberglass—glass balls—and put it into the crucible. After a while, continuous strands of molten glass flowed out of the many small holes in the crucible. They quickly solidified into fibers upon contact with the air. These fibers were quickly wound onto a yarn bobbin along a small pulley. The speed at which silkworms spin silk cannot be compared to that of this "machine silkworm." Each small hole on the crucible spun about 1,000 meters of fiber per minute; a seven-gram glass ball could be made into more than 10,000 meters of fiberglass. The silk spun by the "machine silkworm" was fine, soft, and tough. It was as fine as one-fiftieth of a strand of hair, and only one-fifteenth the thickness of silk. Cheng Weimin took the yarn bobbin filled with fiberglass from the "machine silkworm" and placed it on the plying machine spindle. As the spindle turned, it quickly plied every hundred strands of fiberglass into glass threads that were finer than embroidery thread. These shimmering silver threads, after sizing and other processes, were finally woven on the weaving machine into glass strips as wide as the ribbons that girls use to tie bows.

    An interesting experiment began! Engineer Cheng immersed the glass cloth tape in water. It did not expand like cotton cloth, and it did not shrink when dried. He then burned it on an alcohol lamp for a while, and it still came out as a complete glass cloth tape, only darkened on the surface, because the sizing material on the tape had been burned off. Because advanced fiberglass has very strong heat resistance, this tape can replace the ordinary insulating cotton thread in the wires of motors, which is both safe and can reduce the size of the motor. Stuffing this fiberglass into the walls can ensure warmth in winter and coolness in summer, and it can also insulate sound.

    The most amazing experiment was when Cheng Weimin used a glass rope as thick as a matchstick to lift a motorcycle weighing 80 kilograms. The tensile strength of the glass rope is very strong, even stronger than steel wire of the same thickness. Glass cloth mixed with plastic can be pressed into various parts that can withstand heat and strong pressure, and can also be die-cast into the shells of cars and ships, which will not rot after being immersed in water for decades and will not deform after being impacted. Textiles made of fiberglass are not only beautiful and gorgeous, but can also be arbitrarily cut, folded, or rubbed.

    I remember in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Emperor's New Clothes," it was said that invisible silk could be used to weave silk and satin to make the most beautiful clothes in the world. The fantasy of the fairytale writer has been realized today by the young engineer Cheng Weimin! (Attached pictures)

    养“机器蚕”的人
    陈典谟
    十九年前的理想
    上海南京路上有条弄堂，名叫静安别墅。这条弄堂里住着一位“养蚕人”。但他养的不是普通的蚕，而是一条一分钟能吐二万多公尺丝的“机器蚕”。
    这个“养蚕人”名叫程伟民。说起他养活这条“机器蚕”的故事，可以一直追溯到十九年前。当时，程伟民才十五岁，在中学读书。他很喜欢养蚕。家里的人都称他“蚕迷”。
    有一天，“蚕迷”在一本杂志上看到一篇介绍玻璃纤维的文章，说这种纤维比蚕丝还细，能织成像蝉翼一样透明光洁的玻璃布，做出的衣裳比绸料的还轻。这件事情激起了他极大的兴趣。
    从那天以后，程伟民每天早上少吃一个大饼，把钱积下来，买些材料作试验，同时特别努力地去钻研化学、物理等功课。
    念完高中以后，许多同学都跨进大学，但他因为家庭经济困难，没办法升学。为了继续研究试制玻璃纤维，他便在晚上到交通大学去旁听，增加化学、物理方面的知识。当他找到了银行小职员的工作，生活稍稍安定下来以后，便节省些钱买一些试验材料，并且借了一只煤气灯，继续进行研究。无数次的失败，都没有动摇他的信心。1946年，他自己设计成功了溶化玻璃的电热坩锅，试制成功了初级玻璃纤维。可是，在当时国民党反动派的统治下，不仅没有人关心这个科学成就，他还被反动政府用“制造军用品”的罪名，敲诈去一笔钱。从此，这位青年科学研究工作者，不得已只好离开自己心爱的“家庭研究室”，流浪到街头去替人们修理脚踏车。
    共产党的阳光终于消除了凝结在程伟民心头上的阴影。上海解放不久，国家工业部门的一位干部寻找到了程伟民。他马上参加了中国第一个制造玻璃纤维的工厂——斯美玻璃纤维工厂的建厂工作。以后，他就在这个厂里担任工程师。这个厂生产的是初级玻璃纤维，不但丝很粗，而且容易断，只能做一般的绝缘、隔热材料。去年6月，上海电器电讯工业公司向程伟民提出一个任务，要他在短期内试制成高级玻璃纤维，并且交给他一万元的试验费。程伟民便暂时离开工厂，又回到自己的家庭研究室去了。一万元和两角
    试制高级玻璃最主要的问题，是要提高玻璃纤维的耐热度。初级玻璃纤维只有摄氏八百度的耐热性，高级玻璃纤维的耐热性要达到一千五百度。根据国外的技术资料，溶解玻璃的坩锅都是用耐高温的白金做的。程伟民跑到机械配件商店去买这种坩锅，接待他的店员问他需要买几克重的。
    “几克重的怎么行呢！起码要七百克重的。”程伟民说着，将手里的图样递给他。
    那位店员带着惊讶的神色，摇摇头说：“这么重的白金坩锅，听都没听说过。”
    “多少钱一克？”
    “二十四元。我们这里最重的一只只有六十克。”
    程伟民回到家里，把原来设计的白金坩锅改小了，重量减少到只有四百五十克，准备再去请机械配件商店想想办法。脚跨出了大门，又转身回到屋里。他想：即使店里能设法解决这个问题，高级玻璃纤维能在短期内制成功，但是将来建厂大批生产的时候，就需要一百多只白金坩锅，国家要投资很多；再说，哪里去找这么多白金呢？现在，有些国家不就因为缺少白金，使大量生产玻璃纤维受到了限制吗！有人劝告他说，搞研究试验工作，不能老拨算盘珠，钱总是要花的。程伟民心里明白，如果写份报告，伸手向国家要笔钱买只白金坩锅，不会有什么大问题，何况银行里还存放着工业部门交给他的一万元试验费呢。但是，他不愿意走这条容易走但是费钱的路。
    隔了几天，他又一次来到机械配件商店。他想买炭化硅棒，这也是一种能耐高温的材料。可是，这种材料每根也要十五元，而且是进口货。他就决定不买了。
    好似汽车过马路碰上红灯，程伟民的试验工作暂时停下来了。他终日满面愁容，双手捧着几本国外的技术书，默默地看着，连自己也禁不住地说：“国外制玻璃纤维都用白金坩锅，这是权威！我们能够不用吗？”
    “我看，不一定国外的技术资料都是天经地义的，说不定我们能创造出新办法。”他的爱人、也是他的助手万本仪插嘴说。她并且劝他不要老钻在书本里，去请教请教别人。
    在一个玻璃厂的炉灶间里。墙上的温度表指着一百二十多度。伸出地面半人高的炉子，有几个通红的口子喷射着火焰。程伟民站在这里，趁工人们歇手的一刻，他便问一个老工人：“老师傅，这炉火温度多高？”
    “不知道，毛估估有一千四五百度。”
    “这炉灶怎么经得起这么高的温度？”
    “陶土做的，越烧越牢呀！”
    程伟民听了这些话，沉思一阵，露出了好多天来没有见过的笑容，匆匆地赶回家去。
    一堆灰色的陶土摆在台子上，程伟民和万本仪像大饼摊上的老师傅，拿着光滑的木棒在陶土上碾来碾去，弄得满身斑斑点点的泥浆。
    这天，程伟民浑身觉得轻松了许多，晚上安安稳稳地睡了一觉。因为坩锅制成功，就为制造高级玻璃纤维打响了第一炮。而且，用陶土做的坩锅每只只值两角钱，白金坩锅一只却要一万多元。
    奇异的成就
    今年3月20日，当我得到程伟民用玻璃丝织成布带、制成绳的消息以后，就去向他祝贺。
    一跨进他那不大的家庭研究室，便被眼前的情景惊住了。记得几个月前我到这里来的时候，屋子里还是空荡荡的，现在却摆满了机器。靠墙摆着部熔炉机；房子中央安装着一部小方桌大的织布机，式样同农村的脚踏织机差不多；窗子跟前放着并线机和上浆机。这些机器都是买旧零件七拼八凑装成的。工业部门交给他的一万元试验费，才只用掉两千多元。中共上海市委的一位书记、中央工业部门的几位负责同志，都来参观过这个家庭研究室。他们看了这些机器，看了那只代替了贵重的白金坩锅的陶土坩锅以后，都称赞程伟民的智慧，赞扬他的勤俭建国的精神。
    我们来到靠墙睡着的被称为“机器蚕”的熔炉机旁。程伟民揿一下安装在墙上的电钮，顿时，那“机器蚕”就呼呼地响起来。几分钟过后，“机器蚕”头上的那只陶土坩锅便被烧得红通通的。程伟民拿起制造高级玻璃纤维的原料——玻璃球，装进坩锅里。一会儿，一丝丝的玻璃液连绵不断地从坩锅上的许多细孔里流出来了。它们遇到空气很快就凝结成纤维。这些纤维顺着一个小滑轮飞快地卷在一个纱筒上。蚕吐丝的速度是无法同这“机器蚕”相比的。坩锅上的每个小孔一分钟吐出的纤维，长约一千公尺；一颗七克重的玻璃球能制成一万多公尺玻璃纤维。“机器蚕”吐的丝又细又软又坚韧。它细得只有一根头发丝的五十分之一，只有蚕丝的十五分之一。程伟民从“机器蚕”上取下那绕满玻璃纤维的纱筒，摆在并线机锭子上，锭子一转动，飞快地把每一百根玻璃纤维并成比绣花线还细的玻璃线。这些银闪闪的丝线，经过上浆等工序，最后就在织布机上织成一根根像姑娘们扎蝴蝶结的带子那么宽的玻璃带。
    一个有趣的试验开始啦！程工程师把玻璃布带浸在水中，它没有像棉布那样发生膨胀现象，烘干了也不收缩；再把它放在酒精灯上烧一阵，取出来依然是一根完整的玻璃布带，只是表面上发黑，原来是把带子上的浆料烧掉了。因为高级玻璃纤维的耐热性很强，这种带子可以代替普通马达中电线里的绝缘棉线，既安全，又可以缩小马达的体积。把这种玻璃纤维塞在夹墙里，可以保证冬暖夏凉，还可以隔音。
    最使人惊奇的试验，是程伟民用根像火柴梗那样粗的玻璃绳，吊起一部八十公斤重的摩托车。玻璃绳的抗拉力很强，就连同样粗的钢丝也不如它结实。玻璃布和塑胶混合，可以压成各种能耐热又能抵抗强压力的零件，还可以压铸成汽车、轮船的外壳，在水里浸几十年不会腐烂，撞击后也不会变形。用玻璃纤维制成的纺织品，不但美观漂亮，还可以任意裁剪、折叠或搓揉。
    记得安徒生童话“皇帝的新衣”里说，可以用看不见的丝来织绸缎，做世界上最美丽的衣裳。当年童话家笔下的幻想，今天被青年工程师程伟民实现了！（附图片）
