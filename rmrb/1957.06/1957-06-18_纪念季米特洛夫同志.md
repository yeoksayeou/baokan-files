　　In Memory of Comrade Dimitrov
　　Yan Qing
    Today is the 75th anniversary of the birth of Georgi Dimitrov, the great leader and teacher of the Bulgarian people and an outstanding activist in the international workers' movement. The proletariat all over the world commemorates him with infinite respect.
    Georgi Dimitrov was born on June 18, 1882, in a revolutionary worker's family in the village of Kovachevtsi, Radomir County, southwest of Sofia, Bulgaria. From his early childhood, he suffered poverty and hardship. At the age of twelve, he had to leave school and work as a printing worker. At the age of fifteen, he was already an activist in the Sofia Printing Workers' Union, and at eighteen, he was elected secretary of the Printing Workers' Union. In 1902, he joined the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party. The following year, a struggle unfolded within the party between the reformist "Broads" and the revolutionary "Narrows." Dimitrov firmly stood on the side of the "Narrows" led by Blagoev. In 1903, after the party split, Dimitrov was elected secretary of the "Narrows" Sofia organization. In 1909, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the "Narrows" Social Party. From then on, he was always a member of the party's leadership.
    From 1904, Dimitrov participated in organizing the Bulgarian trade union movement, and in 1909, he was elected secretary of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Trade Union Confederation, a position he held until 1923.
    In 1919, the "Narrows" Social Party was renamed the Bulgarian Communist Party and participated in the founding of the Communist International. In 1921, Dimitrov represented the Bulgarian Communist Party at the Third Congress of the Communist International, where he was elected a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.
    On June 9, 1923, the Bulgarian bourgeoisie launched a fascist coup, established a dictatorial government, and massacred communists and progressives on a large scale. On September 23 of the same year, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held an anti-fascist armed uprising, and Dimitrov led the Central Revolutionary Committee. Dimitrov was sentenced to death in absentia by the fascist court for leading the armed uprising. In 1926, after a provocative trial of the leading organs of the Bulgarian Communist Party by the fascist regime, Dimitrov was once again sentenced to death in absentia.
    In 1923, Dimitrov was forced into exile. After that, he worked in the Executive Committee of the Communist International.
    In 1933, the Hitler Nazi bandits, in order to launch a world war, suppress the revolutionary struggle of the German working people, and eliminate the biggest obstacle to their launching of the war—the Communist Party—fabricated the Reichstag fire, attempting to blame it on the Communist Party. The Hitler gang arrested Dimitrov, who was then engaged in revolutionary activities in Germany, and "accused" him of participating in the organizational work of the Reichstag fire. At the Leipzig trial, Dimitrov thoroughly exposed the fascist provocative conspiracy and ferocious face, and called on the working people of the world to rise up and smash fascism. He turned from defendant to plaintiff, turning the court into a platform for calling for struggle. With the unparalleled heroic spirit of a Communist Party member, he defended the honor of the communists at the Leipzig trial, leaving a brilliant example for revolutionaries all over the world. Thanks to the resolute protests of the working people all over the world and the support of the great Soviet Union, which accepted Dimitrov as a Soviet citizen, Dimitrov was finally rescued from the clutches of the fascist bandits.
    From 1935 to 1943, Dimitrov served as General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. In this important position, he tirelessly called on the people of all countries around the world to establish and consolidate a united front of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people to resist fascism and oppose the war prepared by fascist and imperialist countries.
    During World War II, Dimitrov maintained close contact with the leaders of the Communist Party in Bulgaria. He mobilized the masses to carry out armed struggle against the fascist bandits, and led the Bulgarian Communist Party and all patriots to resist the fascist aggressors and their Bulgarian lackeys. In 1941, under Dimitrov's leadership, Bulgaria organized armed guerrilla teams. In 1942, the Fatherland Front was established. The Fatherland Front played a significant role in uniting all patriotic forces against fascism and overthrowing the Bulgarian monarchist fascist dictatorship.
    On September 9, 1944, with the decisive assistance of the Soviet army and under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by Dimitrov, the Bulgarian people launched an armed uprising, overthrew the monarchist fascist government, and established a people's regime.
    In November 1945, Dimitrov returned to his homeland. He led the Bulgarian people in carrying out social democratic reforms, established the People's Republic of Bulgaria, formulated a new constitution, carried out land reform, realized the nationalization of capitalist industry and commerce, began the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and consolidated the people's democratic regime. Dimitrov led the restoration and development of the Bulgarian national economy. In December 1948, the Bulgarian Communist Party held its Fifth Congress, at which Dimitrov delivered a historic report and formulated the outline of the first Five-Year Plan, which laid the foundation for socialism in Bulgaria.
    On July 2, 1949, just as the Bulgarian people were confidently building their motherland and advancing by leaps and bounds on the socialist road, Dimitrov passed away.
    Dimitrov's name is closely linked with the entire revolutionary process of the Bulgarian people from struggle to victory over the decades, and is closely linked with the growth and development of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Because of the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Dimitrov, the Bulgarian people never lost their direction or confidence in the arduous anti-fascist struggle. During World War II, the number of guerrillas in Bulgaria once grew to more than 40,000. Finally, on September 9, 1944, they achieved victory. From its very beginning, the Bulgarian Communist Party carried out struggles on two fronts: on the one hand, against the opportunist revisionist "Broad" socialists, who finally split from the revolutionary "Narrow" socialists in 1903 and became traitors to the working class; on the other hand, it fought against dogmatic sectarian elements within the party. This finally enabled the party to embark on the road of Bolshevization after 1923. Dimitrov played an extremely important role in these struggles.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Dimitrov, the Bulgarian people carried out tremendous construction work. The first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) for the development of the national economy, which was personally led and drafted by Dimitrov, was completed in four years. Based on the specific conditions of the Bulgarian countryside, Dimitrov pointed out that agricultural production cooperatives with temporary dividend distribution were the most suitable form for the socialist transformation of Bulgarian agriculture. Following Dimitrov's teachings, the Bulgarian people are now struggling with full confidence to overfulfill the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957). In 1956, the total industrial output value was 6.2 times that of the pre-war period (1939), accounting for 70% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. At present, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives and the area of cultivated land in cooperatives have exceeded 80% of the total number of peasant households and the total area of cultivated land in the country, and the degree of mechanization of field work has reached 70%. With the increase in production, the people's living standards have been significantly improved. Bulgaria has been transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country with modern industry and cooperative agriculture.
    Dimitrov made outstanding contributions to the unity and development of the international workers' movement and the establishment of the international anti-fascist united front. In his report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, he profoundly elaborated on the working class's anti-fascist united front, on the establishment of a broad anti-fascist people's front and domestic united fronts in various countries on the basis of this united front, and on the content and form of the united front, thereby greatly assisting the actual struggles of the working class in various countries. He pointed out that "Fascism is war." This analysis of fascism powerfully armed the people in struggle. Dimitrov provided ideological guidance and theoretical assistance to the international workers' movement and communist parties in many ways, and enthusiastically supported and encouraged every victory achieved in the struggle. He helped the communist parties of many countries overcome non-Bolshevik influences and emphasized that the communist parties of various countries should cultivate strong Bolshevik cadres and strengthen their Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation.
    Dimitrov was a thorough proletarian internationalist and a fervent patriot. He believed that educating workers and all working people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism was one of the basic tasks of the communist parties of all countries. He once said, "There can be no true people's patriotism without international solidarity, just as there can be no true international solidarity without true people's patriotism."
    Dimitrov was a loyal friend of the Soviet Union. He often pointed out the incomparably great role played by the Soviet Union, the great first socialist country, in international affairs, in the cause of fighting for peace and opposing war, and in uniting the working people of the world to strive for the victory of socialism. He constantly called on all those who sincerely supported the cause of the workers to unite around the Soviet Union and support the Soviet Union with all their strength. He said, "To test the loyalty and honesty of every activist in the workers' movement, every working-class political party, every organization of the working people, and every democrat in capitalist countries, the touchstone should be their attitude towards this great socialist country."
    Dimitrov frequently emphasized the importance of learning, especially the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. He himself was a model in this regard. He never forgot to study while working as a printing worker, during his tense revolutionary work, and in the enemy's prisons. He said, "Every one of us... from the oldest to the youngest, must study and move forward every day! Whoever does not want to study, does not progress, and stands in the way of others... must be unceremoniously and ruthlessly removed from practical leadership work." He particularly emphasized that the study of revolutionary theory must be linked to practice, and that the study of theory is to solve complex revolutionary problems and to use theory as a guide to action. He said, "Revolutionary sentiment alone is not enough; we must know how to grasp the weapons of revolutionary theory. Knowing theory alone is not enough; we must also train ourselves to be strong individuals with Bolshevik resilience. Knowing what should be done is not enough; we must also have the courage to do what should be done."
    The Chinese people are very familiar with the name of Dimitrov. Dimitrov has always been very concerned about the Chinese revolution. As early as before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in his article "Fifteenth Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party" written in June 1936, he expressed his unlimited sympathy and support for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against the Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression" and for the establishment of an anti-Japanese united front. He also pointed out the great significance of establishing an anti-Japanese united front and overcoming "left" leaning closed-doorism and right-leaning opportunism in establishing this front. During the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Dimitrov repeatedly called on the working class of the world to provide comprehensive assistance to the Chinese people. In his political report to the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party at the end of 1948, he hailed the great victory of the Chinese people. Dimitrov's discussions on the united front, cadre issues, and propaganda work have long been familiar to Chinese revolutionaries. During the first rectification movement, the Chinese Communist Party listed Dimitrov's important articles as required reading. So far, three different selections of Dimitrov's works, three different biographies, his letters from prison, and many important comments on literature and art have been introduced to the Chinese people. These valuable remarks have become the wealth of the Chinese people.
    Today, as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of Dimitrov's birth, we must especially learn from his quality of infinite loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause and his fearless spirit of defending the dignity of communists, learn from his infinite love for the communist cause and his deep hatred for imperialism and fascism, learn from his tireless spirit of learning, and learn from his great spirit of resolutely struggling to strive for the unity of the world's proletariat, oppose revisionist Marxism-Leninism, and prevent Marxism-Leninism from becoming a rigid dogma.

    今天是保加利亚人民的伟大领袖和导师、国际工人运动的卓越活动家格奥尔基·季米特洛夫诞生七十五周年纪念日。全世界无产阶级都怀着无限尊敬的心情纪念他。
    格奥尔基·季米特洛夫于1882年6月18日生于保加利亚索非亚西南拉多米尔县科瓦切夫奇村的一个革命工人家庭。他从幼年时代起就饱受了贫穷和苦难的折磨。十二岁的时候，就不得不离开学校，当了印刷工人。还在十五岁时他就已经是索非亚印刷工人联合会的活动分子，十八岁时，被选为印刷工人工会的书记。1902年他参加了保加利亚工人社会民主党。第二年，在党内展开了改良主义的“广泛派”和革命的“紧密派”之间的斗争。季米特洛夫坚决站在以布拉戈耶夫为首的“紧密派”一边。1903年在党分裂之后，季米特洛夫当选为“紧密派”索非亚组织的书记。1909年当选为“紧密派”社会党中央委员会委员。从此，他始终是党领导机构的成员。
    从1904年起，季米特洛夫就参加了领导保加利亚职工运动的组织工作，1909年当选为保加利亚革命职工总联盟书记，一直到1923年。
    1919年，“紧密派”社会党改名为保加利亚共产党，并且参加了共产国际的创立工作。1921年季米特洛夫代表保加利亚共产党出席了共产国际第三次代表大会，在会上被选为共产国际执行委员会委员。
    1923年6月9日，保加利亚资产阶级发动了法西斯政变，建立了独裁政府，大批屠杀共产党人和进步分子。同年9月23日，保加利亚人民在保共领导下举行了反法西斯武装起义，季米特洛夫领导了中央革命委员会。季米特洛夫因领导武装起义，被法西斯法庭缺席宣判死刑。1926年，在法西斯政权对保共领导机关进行挑衅性的审判以后，季米特洛夫又一次被缺席宣判死刑。
    1923年，季米特洛夫被迫流亡国外。此后，他便在共产国际执行委员会里工作。
    1933年，希特勒纳粹匪徒为了发动世界战争、镇压德国劳动人民的革命斗争，并且为了消灭他们发动战争的最大障碍——共产党，制造了国会纵火案，企图嫁罪于共产党。希特勒匪帮逮捕了当时在德国进行革命活动的季米特洛夫，“指控”他参加了国会纵火的组织工作。季米特洛夫在来比锡法庭上彻底揭穿了法西斯的挑衅阴谋和狰狞面目，号召全世界劳动人民起来粉碎法西斯主义。他由被告变为原告，把法庭变为号召斗争的讲坛。他以一个共产党员的无比英勇的精神，在来比锡法庭上捍卫了共产党人的荣誉，给全世界的革命者留下了光辉的榜样。由于全世界劳动人民的坚决抗议和接受季米特洛夫为苏维埃公民的伟大苏联的支持，季米特洛夫终于从法西斯匪帮的魔爪下被拯救出来。
    从1935年到1943年，季米特洛夫任共产国际执行委员会总书记。在这个重要的岗位上，他一直孜孜不倦地号召全世界各国人民起来建立并且巩固无产阶级和广大人民的统一战线，抵抗法西斯主义，反对法西斯和帝国主义国家准备的战争。
    在第二次世界大战期间，季米特洛夫同保加利亚国内的共产党领导人保持着密切的联系。他动员人民群众起来同法西斯强盗们进行武装斗争，领导了保加利亚共产党和一切爱国人士武装反抗法西斯侵略者和他们的保加利亚走狗。1941年，在季米特洛夫的领导下，保加利亚组织了武装游击队，1942年，成立了祖国阵线。祖国阵线在团结一切爱国力量反对法西斯主义、推翻保加利亚保皇法西斯独裁政权的斗争中起了重大的作用。
    1944年9月9日，保加利亚人民在苏联军队的决定性的帮助下，在以季米特洛夫为首的保加利亚共产党的领导下，发动了武装起义，推翻了保皇法西斯政府，建立了人民政权。
    1945年11月，季米特洛夫回到了祖国。他领导保加利亚人民进行了社会民主改革，成立了保加利亚人民共和国，制定了新宪法，进行了土地改革，实现了资本主义工商业的国有化，开始了农业和手工业的社会主义改造，巩固了人民民主政权。季米特洛夫领导了保加利亚国民经济的恢复和发展工作。1948年12月，保加利亚共产党举行了第五次代表大会，季米特洛夫在会上做了历史性的报告，并制定了奠定保加利亚社会主义基础的第一个五年计划的纲要。
    1949年7月2日，正当保加利亚人民满怀信心地建设着自己的祖国、大踏步地在社会主义道路上前进的时候，季米特洛夫逝世了。
    季米特洛夫的名字是同保加利亚人民几十年来从斗争到胜利的整个革命过程紧密地联系着的，是同保加利亚共产党的成长和发展紧密联系着的。保加利亚人民因为有了以季米特洛夫为首的共产党的领导，在艰苦的反法西斯斗争中从来没有迷失过方向，从来没有丧失过信心。在第二次大战期间，保加利亚的游击队曾经发展到四万多人。终于在1944年9月9日取得了胜利。保加利亚共产党从一成立就进行了两条战线的斗争：一方面，反对机会主义修正主义的“广泛派”社会主义者，这一派终于在1903年同革命的“紧密派”社会主义者分裂，成为工人阶级的叛徒；另一方面又同党内的教条主义宗派主义分子进行斗争。这使党终于从1923年以后开始走上布尔什维克化的道路。季米特洛夫在这些斗争中起了极其重要的作用。
    解放以后，保加利亚人民在以季米特洛夫为首的共产党的领导下，进行了巨大的建设工作。由季米特洛夫亲自领导拟订的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划（1949—1953年）在四年时间中就完成了。季米特洛夫根据保加利亚农村的具体情况，指出土地暂时分红的农业生产合作社是对保加利亚农业进行社会主义改造的最适合的形式。保加利亚人民遵循着季米特洛夫的遗教，现在正在信心百倍地为超额完成第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）而斗争。1956年工业总产值为战前（1939年）的六点二倍，占工农业生产总值的70％。目前，参加农业生产合作社的农户和合作社耕地面积都已超过全国农户和全国耕地的80％，田间工作的机械化程度已达70％。随着生产的增涨人民生活有了显著的提高。保加利亚已经由一个落后的农业国变为一个拥有现代化工业和合作化农业的工业一农业国了。
    季米特洛夫对国际工人运动的团结和发展，以及国际反法西斯统一战线的建立作出了卓越的贡献。他在共产国际第七次代表大会的报告中，对于工人阶级反法西斯统一战线、对于在这个统一战线的基础上建立广泛的反法西斯人民战线和各国国内的统一战线以及统一战线的内容和形式，都作了深刻的阐述，从而大大帮助了各国工人阶级的实际斗争。他指出：“法西斯主义就是战争”，对法西斯主义的这种分析，有力地武装了斗争中的人民。季米特洛夫在许多方面给国际工人运动和各国共产党以思想指导和理论帮助，并且热情地支持和鼓励在斗争中所取得的每一个胜利。他帮助许多国家的共产党克服非布尔什维克的影响，强调各国共产党要培养坚强的布尔什维克干部，加强马克思列宁主义的理论修养。
    季米特洛夫是一个彻底的无产阶级国际主义者和热情的爱国主义者。他认为，以无产阶级国际主义精神教育工人和一切劳动人民，是各国共产党的基本任务之一。他曾经说过：“没有国际的团结就不能有真正的人民的爱国主义，正如没有真正的人民的爱国主义就不能有真正的国际主义团结一样。”
    季米特洛夫是苏联的忠诚朋友，他经常指出苏联这个伟大的第一个社会主义国家在国际事务中、在争取和平反对战争和团结全世界劳动人民争取社会主义胜利的事业中所起的无比巨大的作用。他不断号召一切真诚拥护工人事业的人们团结在苏联的周围，并且以全力支持苏联。他说过：“要考验工人运动中每一个活动分子、每一个工人阶级政党和每一个劳动人民的组织、每一个在资本主义国家中的民主人士的忠诚老实，就要以他们对于这个伟大的社会主义国家所抱的态度为试金石。”
    季米特洛夫经常强调学习，特别是马克思列宁主义理论学习的重要性。他自己在这方面就是一个典范。他在做印刷工人时，在紧张的革命工作中，在敌人的监狱里，都不忘学习。他说过：“我们每一个人，……从最年长的到最年幼的，都必须学习，每天都要前进一步！谁不想学习，不进步，挡别人的道，……谁就要不客气地、无情地从实际领导工作中被免职。”他特别强调学习革命理论要联系实际，学习理论是为了解决复杂的革命问题，是为了把理论当作行动的指南。他说：“只有革命的感情是不够的，我们必须懂得怎样掌握革命理论的武器。只懂得理论是不够的，我们还必须把自己锻炼成为一个具有布尔什维克的坚韧性的坚强人物。只懂得应该做什么是不够的，我们还必须具有把应该做的事做出来的勇气。”
    中国人民十分熟悉季米特洛夫的名字。季米特洛夫对中国的革命一直是十分关怀的。远在抗日战争爆发以前，他在1936年6月写的
  “中国共产党十五周年纪念”一文中就对中国人民在中国共产党的领导下所进行的反对国民党的“围剿”和争取建立抗日统一战线的英勇斗争给予无限的同情和支持，他并且指出了建立抗日统一战线的重大意义和在建立这一战线中应克服“左”倾关门主义和右倾机会主义。在抗日战争的艰苦年代里，季米特洛夫几次号召全世界工人阶级给中国人民以全面的援助。他在1948年底对保共第五次代表大会所作的政治报告中，欢呼了中国人民的伟大胜利。季米特洛夫关于统一战线、干部问题和宣传工作等方面的论述，早已为中国革命者所熟知。中国共产党在第一次整风运动中，曾将季米特洛夫的重要文章列为必读文件。到目前为止，在中国已经出版过三种不同的季米特洛夫选集，三种不同的传记，他的狱中书信和对文艺方面的许多重要言论都已介绍给中国人民了。这些宝贵的言论都已经成为中国人民的财富。
    今天，在我们纪念季米特洛夫诞生七十五周年的时候，我们特别要学习他对无产阶级革命事业无限忠诚的品质和捍卫共产主义者的尊严的大无畏精神，学习他对共产主义事业的无限热爱和对帝国主义、法西斯主义的深切痛恨的精神，学习他的孜孜不倦的好学精神，学习他为争取世界无产阶级的团结、反对修正马克思列宁主义和把马克思列宁主义变成僵死的教条的坚决斗争的伟大精神。
