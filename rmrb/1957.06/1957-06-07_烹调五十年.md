Cooking for Fifty Years
    Jin Shou Shen

    It is a happy thing for someone to be able to cook a few signature dishes and invite friends to taste them. Like Mr. Tan Zhuanqing, the founder of "Tan Family Cuisine," he was originally just such a person. Speaking of master chefs, they are also like this. From the time they start as apprentices until they are able to graduate, until they can oversee the second stove, and until they can oversee the main stove, they have only one thought: how to make a signature dish that people will appreciate. They absolutely do not have another thought: to wash the spoon at any time and change careers. It is precisely because master chefs have this high degree of professionalism that it is very common for them to revolve around the fire for fifty or sixty years. Taking the master chefs in the Beijing catering industry as an example, there are countless who have been cooking for more than fifty years. However, it is rare to see several master chefs who have been cooking for fifty years or more gathered together to cook. There is only one place, and that is the five master chefs of the Beihai "Fangshan Restaurant," who have weathered many storms and are still healthy.

    Mentioning the words "Fangshan," of course, one knows that most of the food and drink here is imitated from the "imperial cuisine" of the "imperial palace." Those who can make "imperial cuisine" are, of course, the master chefs of the "imperial palace" in those years. That's right, the five master chefs of Fangshan Restaurant: Yang Qingshan, 74, Wen Baotian, 70, and Niu Wenzhi, 69, were all master chefs of the "Longevity Kitchen" and "Longevity Tea Kitchen" of the "Empress Dowager's" palace; Pan Wenshang, 74, and Wang Yushan, 73, were all master chefs of the "Imperial Kitchen" of the "Emperor's" palace. In the old saying of the past: the three served Empress Dowager Cixi, and these two served Emperor Guangxu. Their initial service objects, of course, need not be discussed. Judging only from the fact that the five master chefs participated in the cooking work of Fangshan after the establishment of Fangshan Restaurant in 1925, the service objects have long been different. Their lifelong hard work is still worth introducing. All five of them started revolving in the kitchen at the age of fifteen. Master Yang Qingshan, whom everyone calls "Second Master Yang," said with emotion: "Fifty years? I have been dealing with the 'Kitchen God' for a full sixty years!" I asked them why they fell in love with the cooking profession? Niu Wenzhi, who specializes in making cold snacks, said: "When I 'entered the palace to serve' at the age of fifteen, at first I just planned to find a bowl of rice to eat. But after I took an old senior named Wang Sanyuan, who specialized in making cold snacks, as my teacher, I felt that it was not like that. It turned out that there were many tricks in just one cold snack, and I fell in love with this line." "So you fell in love with it because there are tricks in making cold snacks?" Master Niu said: "It's not like that. Please think about a delicate cold snack, make it completely in accordance with the rules, and sometimes, use a little more care to make it even more delicious. Isn't this pleasing? Only when you are happy in your heart can you learn the second kind of cold snack. Over time, making cold snacks has become my favorite thing to do." From the conversation of these five masters, it is known that they all love their own professions. Although they have been cooking for more than half a century, and although they are all elderly people in their seventies, they are still full of energy and are working harder and harder. Like Master Wang Yushan, he learned to cook on the stove since he was a child. He has a unique skill, which is "Four Grasps." The four grasps are: stir-fried fish, stir-fried tenderloin, stir-fried shrimp, and stir-fried kidneys. No one who has eaten Master Wang's four grasps does not praise it, so he got a nickname "Grasp-Fry King." Since Master Wang got this nickname, he has paid more and more attention to his skills. Whenever he goes to the stove, he is often vigilant, fearing that the three words "Grasp-Fry King" will be erased. This loyal attitude towards his profession is truly worth learning and worth promoting. I asked Master Niu and Master Yang, who makes hot snacks: "Do you feel tired lately?" They smiled and said: "Is there anyone who is not tired! In the past, it was only made for one person to eat. How much could be made of small cornbread, layered cake, kidney bean cake, kidney bean rolls, and pea flour cake, no matter how well they were made? Now, how many people love these small cold and hot snacks?" Yes, I have heard that: last National Day, at a banquet to entertain foreign guests, Fangshan Restaurant supplied 4,000 small cornbreads. International friends who ate the small cornbreads all said they were delicious; I have also heard that after Fangshan Restaurant accepted this batch of orders, Master Yang and Master Wen were extremely excited. They said: "In the past, how many small cornbreads did we steam in a year!" They kneaded the dough and made small cornbreads overnight, and also carefully checked them. By the next day, before the banquet started, the 4,000 cornbreads made of corn flour and white sugar were delivered to the banquet restaurant. I asked the masters, is this true? They said: The words are true, this is what we should do! Niu Wenzhi hurriedly interjected: "Why isn't it true? We not only supplied 4,000 small cornbreads, but also many large banquets to entertain foreign guests: Beijing Hotel, Xinqiao Hotel... we have all supplied Fangshan cold and hot snacks!" From their expression, they are not only happy, but also feel that doing so is more meaningful. They said it well, in the past, making food for one person was still made properly, but now making food for so many people, so many countries, how can we not make it well?

    Master chefs who have been cooking for decades will not be forgotten. Zhengyanglou, which has been closed for nearly twenty years, and Master Wang Wu has also been dead for many years, but whenever Zhengyanglou is mentioned, everyone will say: "Wang Wu's spoon skills are really good!" Wang Shichen, who is still very healthy, is also a master chef who has been cooking for fifty years. Whenever crispy chicken is mentioned, everyone will think of this master chef: truly skilled master chefs are always respected. From the cooking process of Master Wang and Master Pan on the stove of Fangshan Restaurant, I have gained inspiration: for example, chives are very delicious, but a single chive is not completely delicious, only the "five-forked bone" part is crisp and tender, so why not stir-fry only the five-forked bone? Why not use the rest as side dishes? For example, old people have bad teeth, why not make shredded braised mutton instead of braised mutton? A chicken has old parts and tender parts. Why not mix the old parts into shredded chicken? Why not stir-fry the tender parts into chicken breast slices? For the past fifty or sixty years, they have truly achieved learning until old age, and they are living in constant improvement every day.

    In Fangshan Restaurant, I saw that the hawthorn topping on the pea flour cake was cut into red five-pointed stars, so I pointed to it and said to Niu Wenzhi: "Master Niu, you are also getting younger." He said: "When I am happy, I unconsciously cut it into red five-pointed stars. In the future, I will think of some ingenious patterns to make the diners feel more comfortable." It can be seen that the master chefs are constantly studying the color, aroma, and taste of food, and are constantly paying attention to the quality of food.

    Master chefs, master chefs who have been cooking for more than fifty years, are worthy of our admiration!

    I sincerely wish all master chefs, including the five master chefs of Fangshan Restaurant, good health!

    烹调五十年
    金受申
    一个人能做几样拿手菜，邀集朋友们尝尝，这是一件快乐的事。像那“谭家菜”的创始者谭篆青先生，最初，就是这样的一个人。说到厨房大师傅们呢，他们也是这样的。他们自从学徒起，以至到能够出师，以至到能看二火（二灶），以至到能看头火（头灶），他们只有一个念头：怎么能做出个拿手菜来，叫吃的人欣赏欣赏。他们决没有另一念头：随时涮勺，改行。就因为大师傅们有这种高度专业思想，所以围着火转个五十年、六十年的，是很常见的了。就以北京饮食品业里的大师傅们来说，烹调了五十年以上的，就数不清了。可是，几位烹调了五十年的老师傅们，能够团聚在一起烹调的，却不多见。只有一处，那就是北海“仿膳社”的五位老师傅，他们久历风霜，仍然健在。
    提起“仿膳”两个字，当然知道这里的饮食品，大部分是仿照“皇宫”里的“御膳”了。能够做“御膳”的，当然是当年“皇宫”里的大师傅了。不错，仿膳社的五位老师傅：七十四岁的杨青山，七十岁的温宝田，六十九岁的牛文质，都是“太后”宫“寿膳房”、“寿茶房”的大师傅；七十四岁的潘文赏，七十三岁的王玉山，都是“皇帝”宫“御膳房”的大师傅。用过去旧话说：那三位伺候过慈禧太后，这两位伺候过光绪皇帝。他们最初的服务对象，当然是不必再谈的。单从1925年仿膳社成立后，五位老师傅就参加了仿膳烹调工作这一点上看，服务对象早就不同了，他们这一生的辛勤劳动，还是值得介绍的。他们五位，都是十五岁就开始在厨房转转了。大家都称他“杨二爷”的杨青山老师傅，感慨地说：“五十年？我跟‘灶王爷’打交道，已然整整六十个年头儿了！”我问他们怎么就爱上了烹调这一行呢？专做凉点心的牛文质说：“我打十五岁这年‘进宫效力’，起初也不过是打算找碗饭吃。等到拜了一位专做凉点心的老前辈王三元为师以后，觉得不是这样了，原来仅仅一门凉点心，也有许多门道，我就爱上这一行了。”“那您就因为做凉点心有门道，就爱上它了吗？”牛老师傅说：“不是这么说。请想一种细致的凉点心，把它做得完全合乎规矩，有时候，自己再用点细心，把它做得更好吃一点，这还不叫人喜欢吗？心里一高兴，才能学第二种凉点心。日子久了，做凉点心就成了我顶爱做的事了。”从这五位老师谈话里，知道他们都是热爱他们自己职业的，虽然他们烹调了半个多世纪，虽然他们都是古稀之年的高龄，可是他们精力还很充沛，而且干得越来越有劲。像那王玉山老师傅，从小就学会了上灶做菜，他有一种拿手活儿，就是“四抓”，四抓是：抓炒鱼、抓炒里脊、抓炒虾仁、抓炒腰花，吃到王老师傅四抓的，没有不夸好的，因此他得了一个别号“抓炒王”。王老师傅从得了这个别称，越发重视他的技术了，他每逢到上灶的时候，就常常警惕着，怕把这“抓炒王”三个字擦了去，这种对职业的忠实态度，是真值得学习、值得推广的。我问牛老师傅和做热点心的杨老师傅：“您几位近来觉得劳累吗？”他们笑了笑，说：“还有不劳累的！过去，做好了只给一个人吃，小窝头、千层饼、芸豆糕、芸豆卷、豌豆黄，做得再好，能有多少？现在，是有多少人爱吃这小玩意似的凉热点心？”是的，我听说过：去年国庆节，在一次招待外宾的宴会上，由仿膳社供应了四千个小窝头，吃到小窝头的国际友人，都说好吃；也听说过：在仿膳社接受了这批订货以后，杨、温两位老师傅，兴奋得了不得，他们说：“过去，我们一年才蒸多少小窝头啊！”他们连夜和面，抟弄小窝头，还经过详细检查，到第二天，宴会开始之前，那四千个玉米面加白糖的小窝头，就送到宴会的餐厅了。我问老师傅们，这话真吗？他们说：话是不假，这是我们应该做的呀！牛文质急忙插嘴说：“怎么不真？我们不是仅仅供应了四千个小窝头，多少次招待外宾的大宴会：北京饭店，新侨饭店……我们都供应过仿膳凉、热点心呢！”从他们神气上看，他们不但愉快，而且觉得这样做更有意思，他们说得好，从前，给一个人做吃的，还是规规矩矩地做好了，现在给这么多人、这么多国的人做吃的，哪能不做好了？
    烹调了几十年的老师傅们，是不会被人忘记的。歇业将近二十年的正阳楼，老师傅王五死去也多年了，可是一提起正阳楼来，谁都会说一句：“王五的勺口真好啊！”就是现在还很健康的王世忱，也是烹调了五十年的老师傅，谁一提起香酥鸡来，谁也会想到这位老师傅：真有技术的老师傅们，是永远被人尊敬的。从仿膳社灶上的王、潘两位老师傅的烹调过程中，我得到了启示：比如说，韭菜是很好吃的，可是一根韭菜，并不完全好吃，只有“五岔骨”部分脆嫩，那么炒韭菜不会专炒五岔骨？不会把其余部分做配菜用吗？比如说，老年人牙不好，炮羊肉不会炮羊肉丝吗？一支鸡，有肉老的部分，有肉嫩的部分，肉老的部分不会拌鸡丝吗？肉嫩的部分不会溜鸡脯吗？他们五六十年以来，真做到了干到老学到老，天天是在不断改进中生活着的。
    我在仿膳社，看见豌豆黄上面的山楂顶码，切的是红五星，就指着对牛文质说：“牛老师傅，您也年轻了。”他说：“我心里一高兴，不知不觉地就切成红五星了，将来再琢磨些奇巧的花样，叫吃的人看着更舒服些。”可见，老师傅们无时无刻不在研究食品的色、香、味，无时无刻不在讲究食品的质量。
    老师傅们，烹调了五十多年的老师傅们，是我们应该敬佩的！
    我敬祝包括仿膳社五位老师傅在内的所有老师傅们身体健康！
