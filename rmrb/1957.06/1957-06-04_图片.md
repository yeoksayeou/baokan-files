It has been twelve years since the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. However, even today, people are still dying from atomic bomb disease. Thirty-seven people died last year, and seven have died since the beginning of this year. The picture shows Hiroshima citizens hanging a large banner that reads "Stop the Christmas Island hydrogen bomb test!" in front of the tombstones of the deceased, and holding a sit-in demonstration to protest the British hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific.
