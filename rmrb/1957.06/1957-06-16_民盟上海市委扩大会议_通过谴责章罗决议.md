　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League passed a resolution today at its enlarged meeting condemning the anti-socialist statements of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others. The resolution stated: "We unanimously condemn the absurd statements of some leaders of the League Central Committee, such as Comrades Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and demand that they conduct a serious examination of the League organization. We also demand that the League Central Committee clearly state its attitude towards the erroneous statements of Comrades Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji." The resolution stated: The participants in the enlarged meeting unanimously believe that Chen Renbing, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, "has consistently harbored emotions and actions of resistance towards the Communist Party, which have been particularly prominent during the recent blooming and contending period. Chen Renbing should thoroughly recognize the seriousness of his mistakes and earnestly conduct a profound self-examination."

　　The resolution also called on all members of the China Democratic League in Shanghai to resolutely draw a clear line between themselves and the right-wing ideology that opposes the Communist Party and opposes socialism, resolutely support the leadership of the Party, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist statements.
