Why Did Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji Make an Issue of the Reform of the Written Language?
　　Cao Bohan

At a symposium held on May 21 by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, inviting leaders of various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士, rightists Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, in their speeches on the work of written language reform, distorted the facts and made malicious slanders against the work of written language reform and the Communist Party. To clarify the truth, we believe it is necessary to refute them.

At that day's symposium, Zhang Bojun said that the reform of the written language was just something a few people cooked up behind closed doors, "only a few enthusiastic people discussed it." After Mr. Shao Lizi refuted him with reason, Luo Longji defended Zhang Bojun, saying:
  "The issue of written language reform was discussed. At that time, the discussion was about the pinyin writing scheme, not about whether Chinese characters should be pinyinized. Speaking of simplification of Chinese characters, there was no discussion of the direction of simplification of Chinese characters; what was brought out for discussion were simplified characters. Moreover, when they were brought out for discussion, it was said that the Party had already decided. In this way, if we展开 discussion, we would be said to be opposing the Party's policy." Zhang Bojun then continued, "I am skeptical of changing Chinese characters to pinyin writing. Chen Yi asked me to speak at the CPPCC discussion, but I did not speak. But everyone agreed to pass it, and I did not object." (The above quotations are all from the People's Daily, May 22)

Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji tried their best to give people this wrong impression of the work of written language reform:
  (1) The government or the CPPCC had already passed a decision to change Chinese characters to pinyin writing. Although Zhang Bojun was skeptical about this, he didn't object because everyone agreed; (2) The work of written language reform was not widely discussed by people from all walks of life beforehand, but was something a few people cooked up behind closed doors, only discussed by a few enthusiastic people; (3) Even if there was discussion, only the "pinyin writing scheme" and simplified characters were brought out for discussion. There was no discussion of whether Chinese characters should be pinyinized and the "direction of simplification of Chinese characters"; moreover, when they were brought out for discussion, it was said that the Party had already decided.

Let's take a look at what factual basis there is for these accusations by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji against the work of written language reform.

First, regarding the issue of changing Chinese characters to pinyin writing.

As everyone knows, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee has proposed a "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme." The amendment to this scheme is still under review by the State Council's Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee, and has not yet been approved and promulgated by the government. The purpose of formulating the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters and promote Putonghua, and to conduct research on various issues related to pinyin writing in language books and periodicals. It is not intended to replace Chinese characters now. We have explained this many times. As for whether China will adopt pinyin writing in the future, this issue has been discussed in our country for more than sixty years, and is still under discussion. Some people agree, and some people disagree. However, neither the government nor the CPPCC has ever made any decision to change Chinese characters to pinyin writing. The Chinese Written Language Reform Committee has never proposed the "pinyin writing scheme" mentioned by Luo Longji.

Second, regarding whether the reform of the written language was widely discussed beforehand.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Written Language Reform Research Committee, headed by Mr. Ma Xulun, was established in 1952 under the leadership of the Government Administration Council's Committee of Cultural and Educational Affairs, to organize experts to conduct research on the simplification of Chinese characters and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. In December 1954, the State Council decided to establish the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee to continue the research. In January 1955, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee published the "Draft Scheme for the Simplification of Chinese Characters." In March 1955, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC organized group discussions, with 128 CPPCC members and others participating in the discussions. In April, discussions were also held at the CPPCC Standing Committee. At the same time, language teachers, philologists, and people from all democratic parties, people's organizations, and cultural and educational circles were organized to conduct discussions in provinces and cities across the country. More than 200,000 people participated in the discussions successively. In addition, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee received and reviewed more than 5,000 written opinions sent from all over the country. The results of the discussions were submitted to the State Council's Chinese Character Simplification Scheme Review Committee for review and approval, and were revised and passed by the National Written Language Reform Conference held in October 1955. Finally, on January 28, 1956, it was submitted to the 23rd meeting of the State Council for discussion. When the State Council announced the "Scheme for the Simplification of Chinese Characters," it still only promoted the 230 simplified characters in the first table; in the first half of 1956, the simplified characters in the second and third tables were subject to opinions from members of the provincial and municipal CPPCC committees in the provinces and municipalities. Currently, these opinions, as well as opinions recently proposed by people from all walks of life, are being reviewed and revised, and no final decision has been made. Regarding the simplified characters in the first table that have already been promoted, we are also prepared to suggest modifications to the State Council based on the opinions recently raised by people from all walks of life, considering them to be inappropriate.

Regarding the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, in February 1956, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee published a draft and an explanation of the guiding principles, requesting discussions from the National Committee of the CPPCC and the committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. At the same time, it was published in newspapers and periodicals to solicit opinions from all parties. In early March, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC held an enlarged meeting for discussion, followed by group discussions. A total of 162 people participated, including members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and people from the fields of culture, education, and science in Beijing. From March to April, 22 provinces, 3 cities, 2 autonomous regions, 26 cities under the jurisdiction of provinces, 4 counties, and 1 autonomous prefecture organized discussions in local CPPCCs. More than 10,000 people participated. When the local CPPCCs held discussions, they also invited members of the National Committee of the CPPCC and representatives of the National People's Congress in the local area, heads of local cultural and educational departments and people's organizations, language teachers from universities, middle schools, and elementary schools, and people who study language and writing. Departments closely related to pinyin letters, such as post and telecommunications, railways, navy, and education for the blind and deaf, organized special discussions of different scales. In addition, from February to September 1956, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee received more than 4,300 written opinions from people from all over the country.

The general situation of the discussions on the simplification of Chinese characters and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is like this.

Third, regarding whether the direction, guidelines, and principles of simplification of Chinese characters have been brought up for discussion.

In January 1955, in addition to publishing the "Draft Scheme for the Simplification of Chinese Characters" in newspapers and periodicals, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee printed 300,000 copies as a separate booklet and distributed them to people from all walks of life participating in the discussions across the country. The last page of the booklet was a form for soliciting opinions, which included four questions. The first two were: "[Question 1] Do you agree that the reform of Chinese characters should take the direction of pinyin writing?" "[Question 2] Do you agree with the principles and methods of simplification of Chinese characters proposed in this draft scheme?" At the large and small meetings on the reform of the written language held across the country in 1955 and 1956, the pinyin direction of the reform of the written language, the principles, guidelines, and steps for the simplification of Chinese characters were widely discussed. Some of these issues are still being discussed. To say that they were not discussed at all is completely unfounded.

Based on the facts listed above, people can see that what Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji said is completely inconsistent with the facts. They said that things that didn't exist existed, and that things that did exist didn't exist, speaking irresponsibly and talking nonsense. Zhang Bojun is the Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and Luo Longji is a member of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee. People can't help but ask: Why did they fabricate and distort the facts and tell lies with their eyes closed? Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji's singing in unison is, of course, to confuse public opinion and create difficulties for the progress of the work of written language reform. More importantly, it is to take the opportunity to play up the issue and maliciously undermine the political credibility of the People's Government and the Communist Party.

Zhang Bojun is very cunning. After his anti-socialist and reactionary words and deeds were exposed and criticized, he repeatedly made "self-criticisms." In these "self-criticisms," he tried his best to make people believe that he had committed a "serious political error" because he criticized the work of written language reform; as if the Communist Party was so arbitrary that, for issues of a cultural nature that are related to the daily use of the broad masses of the people, like the reform of the written language, it not only decided the direction and plan in advance, not allowing discussions from all sectors of society, but also did not allow others to criticize it afterward. A criticism would mean committing a "serious political error." Zhang Bojun used this vicious method to try to downplay the seriousness of his actions, in order to divert people's attention from his anti-socialist words and deeds, and to win the sympathy of some people in society who doubt or even oppose the reform of the written language, so that this group of people would misunderstand and be dissatisfied with the Party. For Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, it doesn't really matter whether or not the written language is reformed or how it is reformed. Their main intention is not this. If someone really believes this, then it is too naive and underestimates them too much. They are merely using the form of criticizing the reform of the written language to launch a malicious attack on the People's Government and the Communist Party. We must not be fooled by their insidious means.

The work of written language reform in recent years has had many shortcomings. We have not widely solicited opinions from experts and the masses in all aspects, and some issues have not been considered deeply enough. We welcome the well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions put forward by all parties. We are also willing to discuss the opinions against the reform of the written language together, following the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. However, we must resolutely refute and counter the malicious slander and vilification of the rightists.

　　章伯钧、罗隆基为什么要在文字改革的题目上做文章？
　　曹伯韩
    5月21日中共中央统战部邀请各民主党派中央的负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会上，右派分子章伯钧和罗隆基在他们关于文字改革工作的发言中，歪曲事实，对文字改革工作、对共产党进行了恶意的中伤。为了弄清是非，我们认为有加以驳斥的必要。
    在那天的座谈会上，章伯钧说文字改革只是几个人关起门来搞的，“只由少数热心分子作了讨论”。当邵力子先生据理驳斥之后，罗隆基就替章伯钧辩护，说：
  “文字改革问题，是讨论过的。当时讨论的是拼音文字方案，而不是讨论中国文字是不是要拼音。说到汉字简化，也没有讨论汉字简化的方向问题，拿出来讨论的是简化字。而且拿出来讨论时，说是党已经决定了，这样，如果展开讨论，就会说是反对党的政策。”章伯钧又接着说：“将汉字改为拼音文字，我是怀疑的，政协讨论时，陈毅叫我讲话，我不讲话。但是大家赞成通过，我也不反对。”（以上引文均见5月22日人民日报）
    章伯钧、罗隆基竭力使人对文字改革工作获得这样的错误印象：
  （一）政府或者政协已经通过决定，将汉字改为拼音文字，章伯钧对此虽然怀疑，但是因为大家赞成，他不好反对；（二）文字改革工作，事先没有经过各界人士广泛讨论，只是几个人关起门来搞的，只由少数热心分子作了讨论；（三）就算经过讨论，也只是拿出“拼音文字方案”和简化字来讨论，没有讨论中国文字是不是要拼音和“汉字简化的方向问题”；而且拿出来讨论时，说是党已经决定了。
    让我们来看看，章伯钧、罗隆基对文字改革工作的这些指责到底有些什么事实根据呢？
    第一，关于将汉字改为拼音文字的问题。
    大家都知道，中国文字改革委员会提出过“汉语拼音方案草案”，这个方案的修正案现在还在国务院汉语拼音方案审订委员会审订中，也还没有经政府批准公布。制订汉语拼音方案的目的，是为了给汉字注音和推广普通话，并在语文书刊上进行有关拼音文字的各项问题的研究，并非现在就用来代替汉字，这一点我们曾经历次说明。至于中国将来是否采用拼音文字，这个问题在我国已经讨论了六十多年，现在还在讨论，有人赞成，也有人反对，但是无论政府或者政协都从未作过关于将汉字改为拼音文字的任何决定，中国文字改革委员会也从来没有提出过罗隆基所说的“拼音文字方案”。
    第二，关于文字改革是否在事先进行广泛讨论的问题。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，1952年即在政务院文化教育委员会领导下成立了以马叙伦先生为主任的中国文字改革研究委员会，组织专家进行汉字简化和汉语拼音方案的研究工作。1954年12月，国务院决定成立中国文字改革委员会，继续进行研究。1955年1月，中国文字改革委员会发表了“汉字简化方案草案”。1955年3月政协全国委员会常务委员会组织分组座谈，参加讨论者有政协委员等一百二十八人。4月间又在政协常委会上进行讨论。同时，在全国各省、市组织了语文教师、文字学家和各民主党派、人民团体以及文教界人士进行讨论，先后参加讨论的在二十万人以上。此外，中国文字改革委员会收到并审查了全国各地送来的书面意见五千多件。讨论结果提交国务院汉字简化方案审订委员会加以审订，并经1955年10月间召开的全国文字改革会议修正通过。最后于1956年1月28日提交国务院第二十三次会议讨论。国务院于公布“汉字简化方案”的时候，仍然只推行简化第一表的二百三十个简化字；第二表、第三表的简化字，于1956年上半年由各省市人民委员会邀集本省市政协委员会委员征求意见。现在正在参考这些意见以及社会各界人士在最近时期所提出的意见，进行审订修改，尚未作最后决定。对于已推行的第一表的简化字，最近经各界人士提出意见，认为不妥的，我们也准备向国务院建议修改。
    关于汉语拼音方案，1956年2月中国文字改革委员会发表草案和关于方针原则的说明，提请政协全国委员会和各省市、自治区委员会讨论，同时在报纸刊物发表，征求各方意见。3月初，政协全国委员会常务委员会召开扩大会议进行讨论，会后并举行分组座谈。参加的有在京政协全国委员会委员、人大常委会委员和文教科学方面人士共一百六十二人。从3月至4月，全国各地政协中组织了讨论的有二十二个省，三个市，二个自治区，二十六个省辖市，四个县和一个自治州。参加人数在一万人以上。各地政协在讨论的时候，除当地政协委员外，还邀请了在当地的政协全国委员会委员和全国人民代表大会代表，当地文教部门和人民团体的负责人，大中小学的语文教师和对语言文字有研究的人参加。邮电、铁道、海军、盲哑教育等同拼音字母关系比较密切的部门，都组织了不同规模的专门讨论。此外，从1956年2月至9月为止，中国文字改革委员会收到全国各地各方面人士的书面意见四千三百余件。
    关于汉字简化和汉语拼音方案讨论的大概情况就是这样。
    第三，关于汉字简化的方向、方针、原则有没有提出来讨论过的问题。
    1955年1月，中国文字改革委员会除将“汉字简化方案草案”在报纸刊物发表以外，曾印成单行本三十万册，分发全国各地参加讨论的各方面人士。单行本的最后一页是张征询意见的表格，其中印着四个问题，开头两个是：“〔问题1〕中国文字改革要走拼音文字的方向，你是不是同意？”“〔问题2〕你对于本方案草案所建议的汉字简化的方针和办法是不是同意？”1955年和1956年全国各地举行的讨论文字改革的大会和小会上，都曾就文字改革的拼音方向、汉字简化的方针、原则、步骤广泛进行了讨论。其中有些问题，直到现在还在继续讨论。把它说成根本没有讨论，是没有任何根据的。
    根据以上列举的事实，人们可以看出，章伯钧和罗隆基说的和事实完全不符。他们把没有的说成有，把有的说成没有，信口开河，瞎说一气。章伯钧是全国政协副主席，罗隆基是汉语拼音方案审订委员会委员，人们不禁要问：他们干吗要捏造、歪曲事实，闭着眼睛说瞎话呢？章伯钧、罗隆基的一唱一和，固然是要混淆社会舆论的视听，给文字改革工作的进展造成困难，而更重要的，还是要借题发挥，恶意地破坏人民政府和共产党的政治信誉。
    章伯钧是十分狡猾的。在他的反社会主义的反动言行被揭发和批判以后，他一再作了“检讨”，在这些“检讨”中，他竭力使人相信：好像因为他批评了文字改革工作，因此犯了“严重的政治错误”；好像共产党是如此专横，对于像文字改革这样关系广大人民日用的文化性质的问题，不但事前就决定了方针和方案，不容社会各方讨论，而且事后也不容许别人批评，一批评就犯了“严重的政治错误”。章伯钧使用了这种毒辣的手法，一方面是企图避重就轻，以此来转移人们对于他的反社会主义言行的注意，一方面企图以此博得社会上一部分怀疑乃至反对文字改革的人士的同情，使这一部分人士对党发生误解和不满。对于章伯钧、罗隆基，其实文字究竟是否改革或者如何改革是无所谓的，他们的主要意图不在于此。如果有人真正这样相信，那未免太天真了，未免太小看他们了。他们仅仅是利用批评文字改革这一个形式，来向人民政府和共产党进行恶毒的进攻。对于他们这种阴险的手段，我们千万不要上当。
    几年来的文字改革工作是有许多缺点的，我们向各方面的专家和群众征求意见不够广泛，有些问题考虑得不深不透。对于各方面提出的善意的批评和建议，我们十分欢迎。对于反对文字改革的意见，我们也愿意本百家争鸣的方针共同讨论。但是对于右派分子别有用心的造谣诬蔑，我们不能不坚决地给以驳斥和反击。
