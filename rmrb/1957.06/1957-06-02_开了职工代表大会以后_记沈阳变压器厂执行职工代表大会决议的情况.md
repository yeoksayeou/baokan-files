　　　　　　(I)

　　In January of this year, the Shenyang Transformer Factory held its first Employee Representative Assembly. After the assembly, the factory presented a completely new appearance in all aspects.

　　On the part of the masses, the majority of employees unanimously reflected that this assembly was a truly democratic one. They said: "Everyone manages their own affairs, the higher-ups actively lead, and the lower levels actively work; there is nothing that cannot be done."

　　In the past, the masses had two opinions about the leadership: one was "the leadership has the final say," which was not democratic; the other was "the leadership's word doesn't count," meaning they didn't handle matters seriously. This time, some resolutions or proposals were implemented within two or three days after the meeting. Workers said: "This assembly really solves problems!"

　　After the meeting, the masses' sense of ownership and their thinking about running the enterprise diligently and thriftily became clearer, their enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy became higher. Some who were previously lagging behind also became advanced producers, and rationalization proposals have been increasing daily. Yu Wenfu from the supply department went to inspect scrap steel in his spare time and found 10,000 iron washers that no one had paid attention to for several years, which could save 925 yuan. Li Qinghui, who used to produce defective products, be late, leave early, and stir up trouble, has not had a single accident since the first quarter, and has saved 2,000 yuan worth of bakelite boards, and was named an advanced producer.

　　The employees' consciousness of observing labor discipline has also improved, and solidarity is also stronger than in the past. This factory added more than 1,000 new employees last year. Because education was not given enough attention, labor discipline was lax, and bad phenomena such as lateness, early departure, absenteeism, fighting, scolding, and teasing women occurred frequently. After the assembly, the political awareness of most employees improved, and those few with low awareness were also under pressure from public opinion and dared not make trouble. Now these undesirable tendencies have basically been eliminated.

　　In the past, the most prominent contradiction in employee relations was the one between inspectors and production workers. Now the relationship has improved. Inspectors not only have a better attitude during inspections, but also proactively help workers find samples and study technology; workers also realize that inspectors' serious inspections are responsible to the country, and they should not take an opposing attitude. In the past, workers and cooks often argued, but now the cooks have improved their service attitude, and the workers understand that they should respect the labor of the cooks, so the relationship has also improved.

　　On the part of the leading cadres, whether they are factory or workshop leaders, they generally reflect that since the Employee Representative Assembly, it seems that a kind of binding force has been added, spurring them to work hard to implement resolutions and complete tasks. If they don't do a good job, it will be difficult to explain at the next meeting. Their initiative and sense of responsibility in their work have been improved, and the phenomenon of buck-passing between departments and workshops has been greatly reduced. When encountering matters with unclear responsibilities, they generally do not shirk responsibility, but instead get the job done first, and then study how to clarify responsibilities. Many collaboration problems can also be automatically contacted and resolved, no longer bringing everything, big or small, to the scheduling meeting. There has also been a significant change in the style of the cadres, bureaucracy, subjectivism, and commandism have been reduced, and the atmosphere of going deep into the masses and consulting with the masses on everything is strong. In the past, the factory director did not understand and support the difficulties of the supply department well enough, simply demanding tasks, which caused dissatisfaction in the supply department. After this assembly, the factory director and the party secretary personally went to the warehouse to understand the situation, and gave active support in solving the warehouse problem. Several workshop directors who were called "bureaucrats" by the workers can now go deep into the masses and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and the masses have also changed their views on them.

　　In terms of production, after the assembly, the movement to increase production and practice economy and labor competitions have been carried out more deeply. In the first quarter, the factory overfulfilled the production plan despite the shortage of raw materials, producing 52 more transformers, 364 mutual inductors, and 62 switchboards, and completed the trial production of giant transformers more than a month ahead of schedule.

　　　　　　(II)

　　The assembly's resolutions have, in general, been carried out for the most part, as shown by the recent report to the union committee by the factory director. Some have been completely realized, and some are still being implemented.

　　What methods have they taken to realize the resolutions?

　　After the assembly, the Party Committee held a special discussion on the issue of implementing the resolutions, deciding to make the implementation of the resolutions the central task of the factory in the first quarter; held a meeting of party members to mobilize party members to play a model role in the implementation of the resolutions; exchanged experiences of various branches in leading the implementation of the resolutions; combined the improvement of leadership style, going deep into the lower levels, and correcting problems in a timely manner; and also held two meetings to conduct a comprehensive inspection.

　　On the administrative side, a cadre meeting was convened after the assembly to mobilize and deploy the implementation of the resolutions, and annual and quarterly plans for increasing production and practicing economy were formulated; the resolutions were conveyed to all employees by department and workshop; departments, workshops, sections, and groups all formulated implementation plans, and individuals also set guarantee conditions; the factory headquarters organized a three-person inspection team to be responsible for regular inspections; leading cadres also frequently went deep into the lower levels to understand the situation; and also cooperated with the union to organize the exchange of advanced experiences in implementing resolutions and increasing production and practicing economy.

　　The union has taken many measures to supervise the implementation of the resolutions. They listened to the factory director's report, organized representative inspections, and made relevant suggestions to the factory director; mobilized and organized employees to carry out labor competitions, and held meetings of advanced producers to exchange experiences; maintained regular contact with representatives, using methods such as regular meetings with representatives, holding forums for representative group leaders, and exchanging experiences in representative activities, to listen to the opinions of representatives and the reflections of the masses, or to convey the implementation of resolutions throughout the factory to the representatives.

　　The union's listening to the factory director's report is a new experience. It urged the factory director to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of implementing the resolutions of the assembly. On the other hand, before listening to the report, the union also deliberately organized all members to go deep down to investigate the situation. After listening to the factory director's report, many members expressed their different views on certain issues, which promoted the administrative improvement work.

　　After the assembly, the Youth League organization first focused on various incorrect understandings of the assembly and democratic centralism existing among young people, and conducted education through forms such as League member meetings, forums, and debates; at the same time, actively carried out League activities around the implementation of the resolutions, such as giving play to the role of youth supervision posts.

　　The system of employee meetings has been universally established in workshops and departments in order to promote democracy within the workshops and departments and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. This system has also promoted the realization of the resolutions of the Employee Representative Assembly.

　　Another good way is to organize representative inspection teams to focus on inspecting the implementation of resolutions in certain units. After the assembly, the union successively organized five inspection teams to inspect the general affairs, health, supply, and technology departments, and the casting and assembly workshops. In terms of personnel selection, special attention was paid to absorbing representatives who were familiar with the business of the inspected unit to participate. The inspection method is generally to first listen to the administrative report, then organize a forum, individual interviews, on-the-spot observation, and finally analyze, summarize, and submit reports and suggestions to the inspected unit. The inspected unit then takes measures based on these suggestions, mobilizes the masses, and improves work. The advantage of this approach is that it not only promotes the in-depth implementation of resolutions, but also understands the difficulties and requirements of the inspected unit, enabling the upper and lower levels to communicate their thoughts and strengthen unity and mutual assistance.

　　They attach great importance to the use of the power of representatives, emphasizing that representatives should unite the masses, and promote the realization of resolutions through their own exemplary actions and publicity activities.

　　They organized representatives to convey the resolutions and spirit of the assembly to the masses in various ways, and study with the masses how to ensure the implementation of the resolutions; assigned representatives to a fixed section or group (the representatives were originally elected by workshop or department), in order to facilitate their contact with the masses, collect opinions, and reflect them to the leaders or directly help solve them, and at the same time, promptly convey the intentions of the leaders to the masses. For example, representative Li Chunmian learned that the rationalization proposal made by the old master Wang Defeng had not been answered for two months, so he reported it to the workshop director. The problem was solved the next day. Wang Defeng excitedly said: "Xiao Li is really good! I reported it to no one, but when I told you, I got an answer immediately. I must find you if anything happens in the future."

　　They also planned to absorb representatives to participate in some important meetings of workshops or departments, on the one hand, to widely listen to the opinions of representatives and make work arrangements more thorough, and on the other hand, to take the opportunity to explain policies and methods to the representatives, so that their activities would be more proactive. Some workshops have also established a weekly representative forum system.

　　The factory's propaganda work is also done very well. After the assembly, the Party Committee Propaganda Department compiled a propaganda material based on the content of the resolutions, as the basis for the activities of propagandists and representatives to convey the resolutions, and repeatedly publicized it through factory newspapers, blackboards, broadcasts, and other means, and also made critical explanations for various specific ideas that emerged after the assembly. For example, some workshop leaders had little confidence in the implementation of the resolutions and were unwilling to seriously accept criticism from the masses. After repeated education, the vast majority of cadres humbly accepted the correct opinions of the masses, and also explained the incorrect opinions. The ideological burden of the cadres was relieved, and the workers were also satisfied, believing that the opinions they raised, whether right or wrong, could be answered, unlike in the past when they were like a stone sinking into the sea. In addition, advanced figures and model deeds that constantly emerged in various workshops and departments were also promptly praised.

　　The more serious handling of proposals is a prominent feature of the factory's implementation of resolutions. At the closing of the assembly, seven representatives were designated to form an inspection team responsible for checking the handling of proposals. After the meeting, the inspection team classified the proposals, transferred them to relevant units, and the relevant units studied them one by one, put forward opinions on how to handle or not handle them, and notified the original proposers, the factory headquarters, and the inspection team separately, and then formally handled them. The inspection team also checked the handling of the proposals at the same time during the inspection of the implementation of the resolutions, which played a further supervisory role. At present, the inspection team is conducting a comprehensive inspection separately, preparing to make a summary and report to the next assembly.

　　In order to facilitate the leaders to get closer to the masses and actively solve the demands of the masses, they also established a system of receiving visits from the masses and representatives and a reception room for collective family dormitories, both once a week. The family reception room played a significant role, helping families solve many trivial matters in daily life, such as repairing stoves, water pipes, and installing glass, and the families were also satisfied.

　　The union and the Youth League also established a bachelor dormitory life management committee, which is both a mass self-governing organization for maintaining life discipline and a welfare organization. For example, the No. 13 single collective dormitory houses more than 300 single employees. In the past, the living discipline was very poor, no one took care of the sanitation work, and some people had no one to take care of them when they were sick and needed to eat or drink water. Since the establishment of the committee, these problems have been basically solved, and a new life order has now been established there.

　　　　　　(III)

　　Before convening the assembly, the Party Committee of the Transformer Factory summarized its past leadership experience and concluded that "democracy is insufficient, and centralism is weak." The fact is indeed so. According to the factory director, only 52% of the orders issued by the administration in the past could be completed on time. After fully promoting democracy this time, the situation has greatly changed, and the sense of responsibility from leaders to the masses has been universally improved, and the implementation of administrative orders has been much smoother than before. What is particularly exciting is that, due to loopholes in the work and the insufficient supply from the state, the factory suffered a serious coal shortage problem in February, causing extreme difficulties in heating; but because the situation was explained to the masses at the assembly, the employees still insisted on working under conditions of very low indoor temperature (sometimes as cold as minus ten degrees), and no fluctuations occurred. A few people had some complaints, but the masses themselves explained and persuaded each other. These facts show that a high degree of centralism must be based on full democracy, otherwise the so-called centralism is also weak.

    开了职工代表大会以后
    记沈阳变压器厂执行职工代表大会决议的情况
    赵灼卿　杜顺成　贾本仪
              （一）
    今年1月间，沈阳变压器厂召开了首届职工代表大会。大会之后，工厂各方面都出现了崭新的面貌。
    在群众方面，大多数职工一致反映这次大会是真正民主的大会。他们说：“大家事大家办，上面积极领导，下面积极工作，没有办不到的事。”
    过去群众对领导有两种意见，一是“领导说了算”，不民主；一是“领导说了不算”，办事不认真。这次，有些决议或提案在会后两三天便实现了，工人说：“这次大会真解决问题！”
    会后，群众当家做主和勤俭办企业的思想更明确了，增产节约的热情更高了，有些过去表现落后的也变成先进生产者，合理化建议又日益增多。供应科于文福在业余时间去检查废钢，找出了几年无人过问的铁垫圈一万个，可以节约九百二十五元。过去经常出废品、迟到、早退、好挑拨是非的李庆会，从第一季度以来没有出过一次事故，并且节约了价值二千多元的电木板，被评为先进生产者。
    职工遵守劳动纪律的自觉性也提高，团结也比过去加强了。这个厂去年增加了一千多新职工，由于没有抓紧教育，劳动纪律松弛，迟到、早退、旷工、打架、骂人、调戏妇女等不良现象不断发生。大会之后，大部分职工政治觉悟提高，少部分觉悟不高的人也受到舆论的压力，不敢胡闹了，现在这些不良风气已基本消除。
    过去职工关系上最突出的是检查员和生产工人的矛盾，现在关系改善了。检查员不仅检查时态度好了，而且还主动帮助工人找样板，研究技术；工人也认识到检查员认真检查是对国家负责，自己不应当采取对立的态度。过去工人和炊事员经常争吵，现在炊事员改进了服务态度，工人懂得了应该尊重炊事员的劳动，关系也好转了。
    在领导干部方面，无论厂的、车间的领导干部，一般都有这样反映：自从职工代表大会以后，好像增加了一种约束力量，鞭策着自己努力贯彻决议，完成任务。如果不好好干，到下次会议时不好交代。他们工作上的主动性和责任心提高了，科室、车间之间的扯皮现象大大减少了。遇到职责不清的事情，一般不是互相推诿“踢皮球”，而是先把事情办了，然后再研究划清责任。许多协作问题也能自动联系解决，不再不管事情大小，一齐拿到调度会上来了。干部的作风也有了显著转变，官僚主义、主观主义和强迫命令作风减少了，深入群众、遇事和群众商量的风气浓厚了。厂长过去对供应科的困难了解和支持很不够，单纯要任务，引起了供应科的不满。这次大会后，厂长和党委书记都亲自到仓库去了解情况，并且在解决仓库问题上给了积极的支持。有几个被工人叫做“官僚”的车间主任，现在都能深入群众，虚心听取群众的意见，群众对他们的看法也改变了。
    在生产方面，大会以后，增产节约运动和劳动竞赛更深入地开展起来了，第一季度，工厂在原材料供应不足的情况下，还超额完成了生产计划，多生产了变压器五十二台，互感器三百六十四台，开关板六十二台，提前一个多月完成了巨型变压器的试制任务。
              （二）
    大会从最近厂长向工会委员会所做的汇报表明，大会决议有的已全部实现，有的正在继续执行。总的看来，可以说是绝大部分都贯彻了。
    他们采取了一些什么办法来实现决议呢？
    党委会在大会以后，对贯彻决议问题专门作了讨论，决定把贯彻决议作为全厂第一季度的中心任务；召开了党员大会，发动党员在执行决议中起模范作用；交流了各个支部领导贯彻决议的经验；结合改进领导作风，深入下层，发现问题及时纠正；还召开过两次会议进行了全面检查。
    行政方面，在大会后召开了干部会议，对贯彻决议做了动员布置，订出了全年和分季的增产节约计划；以科室、车间为单位，向全体职工传达了决议；科室、车间、工段、小组都订了执行计划，个人还订了保证条件；厂部组织了三人检查组，负责经常检查；领导干部也经常深入下层了解情况；还协同工会组织了交流贯彻决议和增产节约的先进经验。
    工会采取了很多办法来监督决议的执行。他们听取厂长汇报，组织代表视察，向厂长提出有关的建议；动员和组织职工开展劳动竞赛，召开先进生产者会议交流经验；经常保持和代表的联系，用定期接见代表、召开代表组长座谈会、交流代表活动经验等办法，听取代表的意见和群众的反映，或把全厂执行决议情况传达给代表。
    工会听取厂长汇报是个新经验，它督促厂长对贯彻大会决议的工作进行了一次全面检查。另一方面，工会在听取汇报之前，也特意组织全体委员深入下去摸了一下情况。当听了厂长报告之后，许多委员都发表了自己对某些问题的不同看法，对行政改进工作起了推动作用。
    青年团组织在大会后首先抓住青年中存在的对大会和民主集中制的各种不正确认识，通过团员大会、座谈会、辩论会等形式进行了教育；同时围绕着贯彻决议，积极开展了团的活动，如发挥青年监督岗的作用等。
    在车间和科室，普遍建立了职工大会制度，以发扬车间和科室内部的民主，进一步调动群众的积极性。这种制度也促进了职工代表大会决议的实现。
    还有一个很好的办法是组织代表视察组，重点检查某些单位执行决议的情况。大会之后，工会先后组织了五个视察小组，分别到总务、卫生、供应、工艺等科和铸造、装配两车间进行了视察。在人选上特别注意了吸收对视察单位业务熟悉的代表参加。视察的方法一般是先听取行政的汇报，然后组织座谈，个别访问，实地观察，最后分析、总结，向被视察单位提出报告和建议。被视察单位则根据这些建议，采取措施，发动群众，改进工作。这种做法的好处是既推动了决议的深入贯彻，又了解了被视察单位的困难和要求，使上下左右沟通了思想，加强了团结和互助。
    他们很重视运用代表的力量，强调代表要团结群众，要以自己的模范行动和宣传活动来促进决议的实现。
    他们组织代表用各种方法向群众传达大会的决议和精神，和群众一起研究如何保证决议的执行；把代表分别固定在一个工段或小组（代表原先是由车间或科室为单位选举的），以便于他们联系群众，搜集意见，反映给领导或直接帮助解决，同时把领导意图及时传达给群众。如代表李春绵了解到老师傅王德凤提的合理化建议两月没有得到答复，便反映给车间主任。第二天问题便解决了。王德凤兴奋地说：“小李真行！我向谁提也没起作用，向你说了马上给答复了。今后有事一定要找你。”
    他们还有计划地吸收代表参加一些车间或科室的重要会议，一方面可以广泛听取代表的意见，使工作安排得更周到，另一方面又可借此向代表交代政策和方法，使他们的活动更主动。有的车间还建立了每星期一次的代表座谈会制度。
    这个厂的宣传工作也做得很好。大会结束后，党委宣传部就根据决议内容编写了一个宣传材料，作为宣传员活动和代表传达决议的依据，又通过厂报、黑板报、广播等反复宣传，还针对大会后出现的各种具体思想，分别做了批判解释。如某些车间领导干部对执行决议信心不高，不愿认真接受群众的批评。在进行了反复教育以后，绝大多数干部对群众的正确意见都虚心接受了，对不正确的意见也做了解释。干部思想负担解除了，工人也满意，认为提出的意见对不对都能得到答复，不像过去石沉大海了。此外，对各车间和科室不断涌现出来的先进人物和模范事例，也及时进行了表扬。
    对提案处理得比较认真，是这个厂贯彻决议的一个突出的特点。大会闭幕时，即指定七个代表组成了检查组，负责检查处理提案的工作。会后，检查组将提案分类归口，分别转给有关单位。有关单位逐条进行了研究，提出如何处理或不能处理的意见，分别通知原提案人、厂部和检查组，然后正式处理。在视察组视察决议执行情况时，对提案的处理情形也同时进行了检查，起了进一步督促的作用。目前，检查组正在分头进行全面检查，准备做出总结向下次大会汇报。
    为了便于领导多接近群众，主动解决群众的要求，他们还建立了接待群众和代表来访日制度和集体家属宿舍接待室，都是一星期一次。家属接待室起了不少作用，帮助家属解决了许多日常生活琐事，如修炉灶、自来水管、安玻璃等，家属们还满意。
    工会和青年团还建立了独身宿舍生活管理委员会，它既是群众维护生活纪律的自治组织，又是一个福利组织。如十三路独身集体宿舍共住单身职工三百多人，过去生活纪律很不好，卫生工作也无人过问，有些人病了吃饭喝水都没人照顾。自从成立委员会后，这些问题都基本得到解决，现在那里已建立起一种新的生活秩序。
              （三）
    变压器厂党委在召开大会之前，曾总结了过去的领导经验，得出的结论是：“民主不够，集中无力。”事实也确是如此。据厂长说，过去行政所下命令，能够按期完成的只有52％。这次充分发扬了民主以后，情况大大改变，从领导到群众，责任感普遍提高了，对行政命令的执行比以前顺利得多了。特别使人感到兴奋的是，由于工作上的漏洞和国家供应量不足，工厂在2月份发生了严重缺煤问题，造成取暖上的极端困难；但因为在大会上向群众交了底，所以职工在室内温度很低的条件下（有时冷到零下十度），仍然坚持工作，没有发生波动，少数人有点怨言，也由群众自己相互解释说服了。这些事实说明，高度的集中必须有充分的民主做基础，否则所谓集中也是无力的。
