　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 14th. The Chiang Kai-shek F-86 fighter plane, which was chased by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and fled to Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong last year, was secretly dismantled, packed into crates, and shipped to Taiwan on a cargo ship on March 22nd of this year. This was confirmed today by a spokesman for the Hong Kong British Government Information Services in a written reply to a reporter from the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao".

　　This Chiang Kai-shek plane intruded into the mainland airspace on January 31st of last year, harassing Yunxiao in Fujian Province and Raoping and Wuhua in Guangdong Province. It was chased by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and fled to Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport. That afternoon, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing, requesting the Hong Kong British authorities to immediately detain the Chiang Kai-shek plane and the personnel on board. However, the Hong Kong British authorities sent the pilot of the Chiang Kai-shek plane, Li Shenglin, back to Taiwan on March 12th of last year.

　　去年逃匿香港的蒋机被秘密运往台湾
    新华社香港14日电　去年被中国人民解放军空军追击而逃匿到香港启德机场的蒋军F—八六型战斗机，已在今年3月22日被秘密拆卸装箱，用货轮运往台湾。这是香港英国政府新闻处发言人今天对香港“大公报”记者的书面答复中证实的。
    这架蒋军飞机是在去年1月31日窜入大陆上空，骚扰福建省的云霄和广东省的饶平、五华等地区，受到中国人民解放军空军的追击而逃降在香港启德机场的。当天下午，我外交部就通知在北京的英国代办，要求香港英国当局立即将这架蒋军飞机及机上人员予以扣留。但是，香港英国当局在去年3月12日，就将这架蒋军飞机的驾驶员李盛林送回台湾。
