Bloody Suppression Cannot Save Colonial Rule
French Troops Massacre Algerians for Days

Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 15th: French troops have been massacring Algerians in large numbers across Algeria for days. The French army claims that in operations against the Algerian National Liberation Army on June 13th, they "killed" 180 Algerians in a single day.

At the same time, the French military authorities continue to implement measures of armed suppression in various cities in Algeria. In the city of Algiers, the French military authorities have repeatedly used paratroopers to carry out patrols and search Muslim areas. In the Dellys area, the French 122nd Infantry Division and the Foreign Legion conducted so-called "mopping-up operations" against peaceful residents, killing fifty Algerian civilians in one instance. In addition, according to figures released by the French Naval Command in Algeria, sharpshooters from a half-detachment of a naval unit performing "pacification" tasks in the Nemours area killed more than 300 Algerians in seven days and arrested more than 1,330 "suspected" Algerian citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: As the French National Assembly is about to discuss granting the new cabinet emergency powers to deal with the Algerian issue, the Seine Provincial Peace Council has called on local peace committees and peace-defending organizations to adopt various means, such as holding mass rallies and sending delegations to petition the parliament, to express the national people's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue.

In addition, it is reported that in order to seek foreign public opinion "support" for France's military actions in Algeria, the French Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, specially "invited" diplomatic representatives from the embassies of India, Japan, Sweden, the Netherlands, West Germany, and Uruguay in Paris to "visit" Algeria.

    血腥镇压挽救不了殖民统治
    法军连日在阿尔及利亚大屠杀
    新华社15日讯　阿尔及尔消息：法军连日在阿尔及利亚各地大批杀害阿尔及利亚人。法军自称在6月13日同阿尔及利亚民族解放军的作战中，一天就“杀死”了一百八十名阿尔及利亚人。
    同时，法国军事当局继续在阿尔及利亚各个城市里实行武力镇压措施。在阿尔及尔市，法军当局屡次使用伞兵来执行巡逻和搜索穆斯林区的任务。在德兰仙市区内，法军第一百二十二步兵师和外籍兵团对和平居民进行所谓“扫荡战”，一次就杀死了五十个阿尔及利亚平民。另外，据法国驻阿尔及利亚海军司令部公布的数字，在尼莫尔区执行“绥靖”任务的海军某部半个支队的射击手在七天之内就杀害了三百多个阿尔及利亚人，并且逮捕了一千三百三十多名“有嫌疑的”阿尔及利亚公民。
    据新华社15日讯　由于法国国民议会即将在最近讨论赋予新内阁以处理阿尔及利亚问题的非常权力，塞纳省和平理事会号召各地和平委员会和保卫和平的组织采取召开群众大会和派遣代表团到议会请愿等各种方式来表达全国人民要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的意愿。
    另外，有消息说，为了要替法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动寻找国外舆论的“支持”，法国驻阿尔及利亚驻节部长拉戈斯特特意“邀请”了印度、日本、瑞典、荷兰、西德和乌拉圭等国驻巴黎大使馆的外交代表去“访问”阿尔及利亚。（附图片）
