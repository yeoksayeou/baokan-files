Today's pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia: Cattle and sheep abound, food and clothing are plentiful, ethnic groups are united, and life is peaceful.

Hohhot, June 19 (report from this newspaper) - This reporter interviewed several Mongolian cadres from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Animal Husbandry Department. They used their personal experiences to refute the absurd and reactionary remarks made by some right-wing elements against the Communist Party and the people.

Comrade Hadi has traveled to various banners in the pastoral areas for ten years, contacting tens of thousands of Mongolian herdsmen. He said that regardless of age or gender, everyone says when they talk about it, "Our Mongolian region has never had such a good time: cattle and sheep abound, food and clothing are plentiful, ethnic groups are united, and life is peaceful, how peaceful!" Hadi said that the herdsmen's love for the Communist Party and the new China deeply educated me, like adding steel to my body, strengthening my determination and confidence in the cause of socialism. However, some right-wing elements are clamoring that the Communist Party is no good and want the Communist Party to step down. Where is this the voice of the people? Of course, there are also contradictions among the people in the new society, and there are shortcomings and errors in our work, but the people fully believe that the Communist Party can correct errors, overcome shortcomings, and things will get better and better in all aspects.

Comrade Gongbu Ruoxi said that Ge Peiqi said that the Communist Party is divorced from the people, and the people want to kill the Communist Party. But what are the facts? In the old society, our ethnic minorities were discriminated against, we couldn't hold our heads up when we went out, and we didn't dare to speak in our own ethnic language; now we are respected everywhere, and when we travel by train or go to Beijing, we get all kinds of convenience and help, so everyone is willing to say that they are an ethnic minority. This is all because of the implementation of the Communist Party's ethnic policies, so that our ethnic minorities have gained equal status and the right to be masters of our own affairs. Take our Animal Husbandry Department, for example, minority cadres account for the vast majority of the main leading cadres, three out of five directors and eight out of twelve section chiefs and office directors are from ethnic minorities. Moreover, minority comrades generally hold the leading positions, truly achieving that people have power if they have the position. In the ten years since liberation, Inner Mongolia has trained more than 20,000 ethnic minority cadres, who are responsible for and manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups in all aspects. Such a thing would be unimaginable without the leadership of the Communist Party.

Even if all the trees in the world were turned into pens and all the rivers in the world were turned into ink, one could not write enough about the benefits of the Communist Party's leadership.

Urumqi, June 20 (report from this newspaper) - People from all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region expressed their extreme indignation at the right-wing elements' rampant attacks on the Communist Party and refuted the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies.

Mahmutjan Mahsum (Uyghur), Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region's Political Consultative Conference and Principal of the Political School, said: For many years, we have fought countless times for the equal rights of ethnic groups, and shed countless blood, but all failed because there was no leadership from the Communist Party. For more than seven years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have been as united and friendly as brothers. After the implementation of regional autonomy, the people of all ethnic groups have truly become masters of their own affairs. He said: There is a river in Toksun County, on both sides of which live Kazakhs, Kirgiz, and Mongolians. Before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups on both sides of the river discriminated against each other and did not interact with each other. No bridge had ever been built over the river. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups loved each other and built the bridge. The people of all ethnic groups established new relationships. Whenever there were weddings or funerals in any family, it became the custom to congratulate and comfort each other. If it were not for the good leadership of the Communist Party, how could this be the case? It can be seen that those who say that the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill the Communists are completely wrong.

Yang Fengchun (Hui), Deputy Secretary-General of the Autonomous Region's Political Consultative Conference, said: From the Qing Dynasty's rule to liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang lived in mutual discrimination and feuding disasters every day. After liberation, the thirteen ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region are as close as flesh and blood, which is obvious to all. Even foreign Muslim friends who visited here praised the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao as deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Therefore, it is only natural that the slanderous remarks against the Party are cursed by the people of all ethnic groups.

The famous Uyghur dancer, Kombarhan, said excitedly: We sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their leadership and care in developing the cultural and artistic undertakings of ethnic minorities. She said: In just a few years, Uyghur dance has not only spread to all parts of the motherland, especially with the efforts of Han literary and artistic workers, and is loved by the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Moreover, our minority singers and dancers have also had many opportunities to participate in national cultural delegations abroad. Performances in sixteen countries, including the Soviet Union, India, Egypt, and Afghanistan, have been well received. We must maintain the honor given by the Party and the country, and use more diligent work and practical actions to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers to counter the right-wing elements' attacks on the Party.

The Kazakh young poet and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region's Writers Association, Buhala, said that because I want to write, I often live among the Kazakh people. The conclusion drawn by the Kazakh people from their personal experience is: We wholeheartedly support the Communist Party. However, the right-wing elements want to deviate from the Party and curse the Party. He said that when Chu Anping came to Xinjiang to write, we were able to give him a special car to ride in and send competent translators to help him, all because of the leadership of the Communist Party; otherwise, I am afraid he would not even be able to ride a donkey. Buhala said, let me use the poem from the movie "Hasan and Jamila" to express the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang: Even if all the trees in the world were turned into pens and all the rivers in the world were turned into ink, one could not write enough about the benefits of the Communist Party's leadership.

### 没有共产党的领导就没有民族平等  内蒙古新疆青海云南少数民族驳斥右派言论

    没有共产党的领导就没有民族平等
    内蒙古新疆青海云南少数民族驳斥右派言论
　　今日的内蒙古牧区：牛羊成群，吃穿不愁，民族团结，日子太平
    本报呼和浩特19日电　本报记者访问了内蒙古自治区畜牧厅几个蒙古族干部，他们以自己亲身经历驳斥了某些右派分子反共、反人民的胡言乱语。
    哈迪同志十年来走遍了牧区各旗，接触了成千上万的蒙古族牧民。他说，无论男女老少，一谈起来就说，咱们蒙古地方从来也没有这么好的世道：牛羊成群，吃穿不愁，民族团结，日子太平，多坦然！哈迪说，牧民对共产党、对新中国的热爱，深深地教育了我，就像在我身上加了钢一样，加强了我对社会主义事业的决心和信心。但是，一些右派分子大叫共产党不好，要共产党下台，这哪里是人民的声音呢？当然，新社会人民内部也有矛盾，工作中也有缺点和错误，但是人民完全相信共产党可以纠正错误，克服缺点，各方面都会一天比一天更好起来。
    贡布若希同志说，葛佩琦说共产党脱离人民，人民要杀共产党。可是，事实怎样呢？旧社会我们少数民族受歧视，出门抬不起头来，不敢用本民族语言说话；现在却是处处受尊重，出门坐火车，或到北京去，会得到各种方便和帮助，所以大家都愿意说出自己是少数民族。这都是因为执行了共产党的民族政策，我们少数民族才获得了平等的地位和当家作主的权利。就以我们畜牧厅来说吧，在主要领导干部中，少数民族干部占了绝大多数，五个厅长中有三个，十二个处长和办公室主任中有八个都是少数民族。而且少数民族同志一般都担任了正职，真正做到了有职有权。解放后十年来，内蒙古培养了两万多民族干部，在各方面担当和管理着本民族的事务。这样的事假若不是共产党的领导，是根本难以想像的。
　　把天下的树都变成笔，把天下的河都变成墨，也写不完共产党领导的好处。
    本报乌鲁木齐20日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族各界人民对右派分子向共产党的猖狂进攻，表示异常愤慨，纷纷驳斥反党、反社会主义的谬论。
    自治区政协副主席、政治学校副校长买合买提江·马合苏木（维吾尔族）说：多少年来我们为了民族的平等权利，作过无数次的斗争，不知流过多少鲜血，但因为没有共产党的领导都失败了。七年多来，有了党的领导，自治区各族人民团结友好得像亲兄弟。实行区域自治后，各族人民真正当家作主了。他说：托克逊县有一条河，两岸居住着哈萨克、柯尔克孜和蒙古人，解放前，两岸各族人民互相歧视、互不往来，河上从来没有架起过一座桥。解放后，各民族人民相亲相爱，把桥架起来了，各族人民建立了新的关系，每逢谁家婚丧喜事，相互祝贺、安慰成了风气。如果不是共产党领导得好，哪会是这样。可见那些说群众要推翻共产党，要杀共产党人的人是大错特错了。
    自治区政协副秘书长杨逢春（回族）说：自清朝统治到解放止，新疆各民族人民没有一天不是生活在相互歧视、仇杀的灾难中。解放后，自治区十三个民族亲如骨肉是有目共睹的，就连外国穆斯林朋友们在这里参观了之后，也都连声赞颂党和毛主席的领导深得人心。所以，诬蔑党的言论，遭到我们各族人民的诅咒是很自然的。
    著名的维吾尔族舞蹈家康巴尔汗激动地说：我们从心底感谢党和毛主席对发展少数民族文化艺术事业的领导和关怀。她说：短短的几年来，维吾尔舞蹈已在各民族的、特别是汉族的文艺工作者的努力下，不但流传到祖国各地，为全国各族人民所喜爱，而且，我们少数民族的歌唱家、舞蹈家还多次有机会参加国家的文艺代表团出国，在苏联、印度、埃及、阿富汗等十六个国家中的演出都博得了好评。我们要维护党和国家给的荣誉，以更加勤苦的工作，为工农兵服务的实际行动，来反击右派分子向党的进攻。
    哈萨克青年诗人、自治区作协副主席布哈拉说，由于我要写作，我常生活在哈萨克人民中。哈萨克族人民从亲身的体验中，得出的结论是：衷心拥护共产党。可是，右派分子却要背离党、咒骂党。他说，储安平来新疆写作，我们能给他专车坐，派出得力翻译帮助他，也都是因为有了共产党的领导；否则，怕他连毛驴也骑不上。布哈拉说，让我再用“哈森与加米拉”电影中的诗来表达新疆各族人民的心声：把天下的树都变成笔，把天下的河都变成墨，也写不完共产党领导的好处。　（新疆日报编辑部）
