The Pakistani People Congratulate the Chinese People
Speech by Mr. Rahman, Head of the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation, at the National People's Congress

Your Excellency, Mr. Chairman, Esteemed Representatives of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China:

I am very grateful for the warm welcome that you have extended to the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation and for giving me this opportunity to address this solemn assembly. We deeply feel this immense honor; the people of Pakistan value your friendly attitude.

Your Excellency and esteemed friends, from the very beginning, you have accepted the wishes of the Pakistani people, expressed through their parliamentary delegation, to the Chinese people. The people of Pakistan, with great admiration, are watching the achievements you have made under the great leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in all aspects of national construction, and they wish you future progress and prosperity.

Pakistan and China are close and friendly neighbors. History proves that harmonious relations have existed between our two countries since the dawn of human history. The Pakistani people hold great respect for your glorious past, rich traditions, and culture, and regard your great country as a symbol of mankind's peaceful achievements—everything that promotes a nobler and better human life. The enduring civilization of your country, especially your contributions to science, art, philosophy, and literature, is a treasure trove from which all nations have drawn to enrich their own way of life and thought.

In the recent past, our people have been inspired by your continuous struggle for the cause of freedom. Our leader, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Suhrawardy, said during his visit to China: "I have come here somewhat in the spirit of ancient travelers, to see, understand, and learn." The members of the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation have come here driven by exactly the same sentiment.

Our country is a young country, having regained its independence only ten years ago after an episode of colonial rule. Our people, under the inspiring leadership of the late "Great Leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah," waged a resolute struggle for the cause of freedom, but the dawn of independence was also marked by somber and bloody events. The first difficulty our young country had to face was providing housing and resettlement for millions of refugees. However, our people did not look back, and they are constantly striving to overcome various difficulties in order to live in an atmosphere free from domination and fear.

We inherited an unstable and backward economy, and in all aspects of national construction, we had to start almost from scratch. However, when our people see the progress that their efforts and sacrifices have brought in the short years since independence, they have some reason to be satisfied.

Because our country is a backward agricultural country, our people understand the value of education, so our constitution stipulates mass education and makes it free and compulsory at the primary level. Our economy is mainly agricultural, so our people attach great importance to agricultural development, and some scientific methods and technologies are being adopted to increase agricultural production. Our people are resolutely struggling to provide basic necessities, as well as adequate facilities in housing, clothing, education, medical relief, and employment.

As Your Excellency and other esteemed friends know, Pakistan practices a parliamentary system of government. Elections for provincial assemblies and the National Assembly are held on the basis of universal adult suffrage. We have decided to hold general elections next year according to the provisions of the new constitution. Elections based on universal adult suffrage are the cornerstone of all democratic governments; the Constitution of Pakistan stipulates that all men and women have equal rights, and the people of Pakistan are proud of this fact.

We Pakistanis believe in democracy, freedom, social justice, and the right to self-determination, so our constitution guarantees the following basic rights: equality of status, equality before the law, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of religious belief, and freedom of association. We also aspire to establish social, economic, and political justice in the country, and I believe that as long as we are given peace, we will soon achieve our goals.

Your Excellency, esteemed friends, the Pakistani people are committed to peace and friendship among nations at a difficult time when mankind has invented tools to destroy itself. Our people are aware of their responsibility to future generations, so all our actions are guided by the promotion of international cooperation and understanding. In this way, all countries, regardless of their social and political systems, will live together in friendship and cooperate to promote human happiness.

Our country and your great country jointly participated in the historic Bandung Conference, which strengthened the voice of Asian and African countries and realized their desire for peace and friendship. However, it is very regrettable that the impact of this historic conference has been marred by unresolved differences among Asian countries and the resulting discord, which has greatly damaged the concept of peace and friendship among nations and threatened the cause of peace in Asia. We, the Pakistani people, believe in resolving outstanding international issues through peaceful means on the basis of just principles, in accordance with the UN Charter and the Bandung Resolutions. Therefore, we hope that all countries in the world, especially Asian countries, will guide their international actions with similar sentiments, so that the Bandung Resolutions will not become a mere slogan but a living reality.

Let me assure Your Excellency and esteemed friends that Pakistan is tirelessly working for the cause of peace and is always ready to cooperate in various forms with countries committed to this noble cause. Our people firmly believe that every country has the right to freely determine its own destiny and way of life without foreign interference. Therefore, they sincerely endorse the letter and spirit of the principles of the historic Bandung Conference.

The achievements that your country has made in such a short period of time have deeply impressed the members of the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation and myself. We hope to learn more about your great country and people during our stay in your country. I am also deeply grateful to the leaders of your great country for their free and frank exchange of views with us. The visit to China will remain pleasantly in our memories.

Finally, Your Excellency, esteemed friends, please allow me to thank you once again for your hospitality and assure you that the people of Pakistan share your joy and hope that the pleasant and sincere relations that exist between us will be further strengthened.

Long live the Chinese people.
Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship.
Long live world peace.

### 巴基斯坦人民向中国人民祝贺  巴议会代表团团长拉赫曼在我人代会上的演说词

　　巴基斯坦人民向中国人民祝贺
    巴议会代表团团长拉赫曼在我人代会上的演说词阁下，主席先生，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会可敬的代表们：
    我非常感谢你们给了巴基斯坦议会代表团热烈的欢迎并且给予我这样一个机会向这个庄严的大会讲话。我们深深感到这种莫大的光荣；巴基斯坦人民重视你们的友好的态度。
    阁下和诸位可敬的朋友们一开始就接受了巴基斯坦人民通过其议会代表团向中国人民表达的祝愿。巴基斯坦的人民以十分钦佩的心情注视着你们在毛泽东主席伟大的领导下，在建设国家的各方面活动中所取得的成就，他们祝你们将来进步和繁荣。
    巴基斯坦和中国是亲密的、友好的邻邦。历史证明我们两国之间自人类有史以来一直存在着和睦的关系。巴基斯坦人民对于你们光荣的过去、丰富的传统和文化，怀着很大的敬意，并且把你们伟大的国家看作是人类的和平成就——促使人类生活更高尚、更美好的一切——的象征。你们国家的绵延悠久的文明，特别是你们对科学、艺术、哲学、文学的贡献，是一个宝库，一切国家都从这个宝库吸取了东西，以丰富它们自己的生活方式和思想。
    在最近的过去，我国人民从你们为自由事业而进行的不断斗争中，得到了鼓舞。我们的领袖、巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底先生，在访问中国时曾经说过：“我到这里来，多少是抱着古代旅行家的那种精神，来看看、了解和学习”。巴基斯坦议会代表团的成员们，也是在完全一样的心情的推动下到这里来的。
    我们的国家是一个年青的国家，经过殖民统治的一段插曲之后，在十年前才重新获得独立的。我国人民在已故的“伟大领袖穆·阿·真纳”令人鼓舞的领导下在自由事业中进行过坚决斗争，但是独立的黎明时辰里，也有阴沉和血腥事件。我们年青的国家所不得不面对的第一个困难就是为几百万难民提供住宅并且安置他们。不过，我们的人民并没有向后看，为了使他们自己生活在不被人统治和不存在恐惧的气氛里，他们不断地在设法克服各种各样的困难。
    我们所承继的是不稳定的、落后的经济，同时，在国家建设的各个方面，我们差不多都得从头开始。但是，当我国的人民看到独立短短几年以来，他们的努力和牺牲所带来的进步时，他们感到满意也是有一些道理的。
    因为我国是一个落后的农业国家，我们的人民懂得教育的价值，因此我国宪法规定了群众教育，并且使之在小学阶段成为免费、义务教育。我们的经济主要是农业经济，因此我国人民十分重视农业发展，为了农业增产，正在采用一些科学方法和技术。我国人民正在坚决地进行斗争来提供基本的生活必需品，以及住房、衣着、教育、医药救济、就职等方面的充分便利条件。
    正如阁下和其他可敬的朋友所知，巴基斯坦实行议会政府制。省议会和国会的选举是在成人普选的基础上举行的。我们已决定：根据新宪法的规定，明年举行大选。以成人普选为基础的选举是一切民主政府的基石；巴基斯坦宪法规定：所有男女有平等的权利，巴基斯坦人民对此事实感到自豪。
    我们巴基斯坦人相信民主、自由、社会公道和自决权，因此我们的宪法保障以下一些基本权利即：地位平等、法律上的平等，思想自由、言论自由、信仰宗教自由、结社自由。我们也有志于在国内建立社会、经济、政治上的公道，而我相信，只要给我们和平，我们就会很快达到我们的目标。
    阁下，可敬的朋友们，巴基斯坦人民致力于和平及各国之间友好事业的时候，正是人类发明了毁灭自己的工具的困难时代。我国人民意识到他们对后代所负有的责任，所以我们所有的行动都是以促进国际间合作和谅解为准绳的。这样，所有的国家，不管他们的社会和政治制度，将会友好地相处，并为促进人类幸福而合作。
    我国和你们伟大的国家共同参加了历史性的万隆会议，这次会议使得亚非国家的声音有了力量，使得他们对和平和友好的愿望得到了实现。但是，非常遗憾，使得这次历史性会议的影响美中不足的是亚洲国家间还存在着没有解决的分歧以及由此产生的不和，对关于各国间和平和友好的观念造成了极大的损害，威胁着亚洲的和平事业。我们巴基斯坦人民相信在公正的原则的基础上，在符合联合国宪章及万隆决议的情况下，通过和平的方法，来解决悬而未决的国际问题。所以，我们希望，世界各国，特别是亚洲各国将以相类似的感情来指导他们在国际上的行动，从而使万隆决议不至成为口号而是变成一个生动的现实。
    让我向阁下和可敬的朋友们保证：巴基斯坦不倦地为和平事业而努力，始终准备与致力于这一崇高事业的国家进行各种形式的合作。我国人民深信每个国家都有权不受外国的干涉自由地决定自己的命运和自己的生活方式。所以他们由衷地赞成历史性的万隆会议的原则的文字和精神。
    贵国在这短短的时间内所取得的成绩给了巴基斯坦议会代表团团员们和我自己异常深刻的印象。我们期望在贵国逗留期间能够更多地了解你们伟大的国家和人民。我也深深感谢你们伟大国家的领导人物自由坦率地和我们交换意见。在中国的访问将愉快地留在我们记忆之中。
    最后，阁下，可敬的朋友们，请允许我再一次感谢你们的盛情，并向你们保证巴基斯坦人民分担你们的喜悦，并且希望我们之间现有的愉快和诚挚的关系将日益加强。
    中国人民万岁。
    中巴友谊万岁。
    世界和平万岁。（附图片）
