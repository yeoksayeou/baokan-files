　　Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
　　Mangzhong (June 6th) - Summer Solstice (June 22nd)
　　The basic situation of agricultural activities in various regions during this period is as follows: In areas south of the Yangtze River, apart from some areas that have already harvested or are harvesting early rice, many regions are still continuing to strengthen field management of crops such as early rice and cotton, and are vigorously preparing for the transplanting of double-season late rice. In areas north of the Yangtze River, the summer harvest has already or is nearing completion, and many regions are now engaged in threshing, distribution, summer planting, and field management of autumn crops. While carrying out the above work, various regions have also launched summer fertilizer accumulation and flood prevention activities.
　　Early Rice Will Have a Good Harvest
　　In the vast early rice fields south of the Yangtze River, what the summer breeze now stirs up is no longer the shimmering water in the paddies, but the boundless silken waves of the rice sea. In Jiangxi Province, over 18 million mu of early rice are mostly densely growing and ready for a bumper harvest. In Zhejiang Province, over 11 million mu of double-season early rice are developing rapidly and growing very well, with the vast majority currently sprouting and tillering. In Hubei and Hunan provinces, early rice has begun to head and bloom.
　　In regions with an earlier season, apart from the Wanning, Lehui, and Qiongdong counties on Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, where the early rice has already been harvested, the Leizhou Peninsula, Chaoshan Plain, Pearl River Delta in this province, and Puer and Yuanjiang in Yunnan Province, as well as Haicheng and Longxi in Fujian Province, have also begun harvesting.
　　Currently, regions where the early rice has not yet matured are stepping up field management work such as weeding, applying top dressing, pest control, and preventing lodging. Regions that have already begun harvesting are not only paying attention to careful harvesting and threshing, but are also striving to turn the paddy fields over after the grain is harvested and promptly transplant late rice.
　　Summer Harvest is About to End
　　Currently, the progress of the summer harvest work in various regions is as follows: In the main wheat-producing areas of the Yellow River and Huai River basins, such as Henan, Shandong, northern Anhui, southern Shanxi, and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, the wheat harvest work has basically ended, and efforts are now being fully shifted to threshing and grain separation. In the Tianshui area of Gansu Province, the wheat harvest work in the Jialing River basin areas of Chengxian, Xihe, Liangdang, and Huixian counties, as well as on both banks of the Wei River, has entered a critical stage. In Hebei Province, except for the central and northern regions which are currently harvesting, the southern region is already carrying out the final stages of the wheat harvest. In about ten more days, except for a small amount of winter wheat in the Northwest region, the harvesting work of winter wheat in various regions will basically end. The rainy season has already arrived, and how to ensure the safe storage of wheat is still a problem worth paying attention to.
　　Strengthen Field Management of Autumn Crops
　　The broad agricultural production cooperatives in the northern provinces are now actively carrying out field management of spring-sown crops, striving for a bumper autumn harvest. The Linqi, Jining, Heze, Liaocheng, and Tai'an areas of Shandong Province have already completed the thinning and setting of seedlings for sorghum, corn, and cotton, and have universally turned to summer weeding. The summer weeding work in Heilongjiang Province has entered a critical stage. In this province, more than two-thirds of the land in counties such as Hulan, Qinggang, Kedong, Boli, Yilan, and Jixian have been hoed once, and in the faster-progressing counties such as Baiquan and Anda, the first hoeing has basically ended and is entering the second hoeing. Hebei, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions have also universally launched summer weeding work.
　　While carrying out summer weeding, many regions have also paid attention to applying top dressing and pest control. Due to the strengthening of field management of spring-sown crops, coupled with the recent improvement in climate, the seedlings of cotton, sorghum, corn, etc., which were not growing well in some areas, have begun to turn from yellow to green.
　　The current problems are: some regions only focus on summer harvest and summer planting, and have relaxed field management of autumn crops; some regions have uneven progress in hoeing seedlings, and the hoeing is also very rough; some regions have neglected pest control and top dressing.
　　Launch Summer Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign
　　Currently, it is the time when crops such as early rice, mid-season rice, cotton, and corn need top dressing, and late rice and summer-sown crops need base fertilizer. However, according to reports from many regions, the problem of fertilizer shortage is relatively serious. In order to solve this problem, many regions have launched a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign. In Hunan Province, more than one million farmers are engaged in activities such as cutting green grass, composting green manure, and accumulating soil fertilizer every day. In Gu Zhang, Fenghuang and other counties in this province, more than four million dan of green manure have been accumulated in half a month. After some counties mobilized agricultural cooperatives to cut green grass for composting, the fertilizer shortage problem has been basically solved.
　　In the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign, some regions have appropriately increased the purchase price of farm manure, making it easier for cooperative members to hand over household fertilizer; some regions have properly arranged labor, so that the cooperative has sufficient strength to invest in fertilizer accumulation work; some regions have formulated fertilizer accumulation plans based on production teams, and then allocated quotas to households according to the amount of people and livestock, completing the tasks on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity. In this way, the fertilizer accumulation campaign has been vigorously promoted, ensuring the successful completion of the fertilizer accumulation plan. The fertilizer accumulation work in some areas has not yet been well developed until now.
　　Exterminate Locusts
　　As of the middle of this month, the area of summer locust occurrence and spread in the six provinces and cities of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Tianjin has reached more than 11.2 million mu. However, after various regions adopted chemical agents and manual control, and the central government sent aircraft for key control, the summer locust control tasks in most of the above areas have been basically completed.
　　In the work of controlling summer locusts, due to continuous cloudy and rainy weather, which affected the efficacy of the drugs, the mortality rate of general locust nymphs was only about 80%. Now, most of the remaining locusts have become adult insects. In order to completely eliminate locusts, the Ministry of Agriculture has required all regions to not only quickly strengthen the work of sweeping up the remaining locusts, but also pay attention to the oviposition activities of the remaining locusts, delineate the scope of autumn locust control, and prepare early to eliminate autumn locusts in a timely manner.
　　Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Sugar Crops
　　This year, the planting situation of sugar crops is: sugarcane has not completed the plan of planting 4,175,000 mu proposed by various regions (a difference of about 270,000 mu), but it has planted 600,000 mu more than last year; beet can basically complete the plan of sowing 2,430,000 mu, an increase of 220,000 mu compared with last year. Due to the low temperature and rain in the main sugarcane producing areas this year, coupled with untimely field management, the growth of sugarcane plants is relatively slow; the sowing season for beets was also generally delayed by about ten days this year due to the lower temperature. At present, some areas of sugarcane and beet fields have experienced insect pests, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings is also relatively serious, which is detrimental to the increase in sugar crop production this year.
　　In order to strive for a bumper harvest of sugar crops, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces have respectively convened sugarcane production symposiums and small-scale technical exchange meetings, and proposed measures such as checking seedlings and replanting, timely intertillage and top dressing, and controlling pests; Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have implemented production reward methods and fully supplied pest control machinery and medicine; Jilin and other provinces have adjusted the purchase price of beets, encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for production. At present, farmers in sugar crop producing areas are actively carrying out field management work.

　　半月农情
    芒种（六月六日）——夏至（六月二十二日）
    这个期间，各地农事活动的基本情况是：在长江以南地区，除部分地区已经或正在收割早稻外，许多地区仍在继续加强早稻、棉花等作物的田间管理工作，并大力进行双季晚稻的栽插准备工作；在长江以北地区，夏收已经或接近基本结束，不少地区现正进行打场、分配、夏种以及大秋作物的田间管理工作。在进行上述工作的同时，各地还开展了夏季积肥、防汛等活动。
　　早稻将有好收成
    在长江以南地区广阔的早稻田里，现在夏风吹起的已不是盈盈田水，而是无边的稻海丝波。江西省的一千八百多万亩早稻，大部密茂封行，丰收在望；浙江省的一千一百多万亩双季早稻飞快发育，成长情况十分良好，绝大部分正在发棵分蘖；湖北、湖南两省的早稻，已开始抽穗扬花。
    季节较早的地区，除广东省海南岛的万宁、乐会、琼东三县的早稻已收割完毕外，这个省的雷州半岛、潮汕平原、珠江三角洲和云南省的普洱、元江及福建省的海澄、龙溪等地，也已开始收割。
    现在，早稻尚未成熟的地区，正在加紧进行耘田、施追肥、除虫、防倒伏等田间管理工作；已经开始收割的地区，除注意精收细打外，还争取做到谷倒田翻身，及时栽上晚稻。
    夏收即将结束
    目前，各地夏收工作的进度是这样：黄河、淮河地区主要产麦区的河南、山东、淮北、晋南和陕西关中一带的麦收工作，已经基本结束，现正全力转入打场脱粒工作；甘肃天水专区嘉陵江流域的成县、西和、两当、徽县等地及渭河两岸的麦收工作，已进入紧张阶段；河北省除中部、北部正在收割外，南部地区已在进行麦收扫尾。再有十天左右的时间，除了西北地区的少数冬小麦外，各地冬小麦的收割工作将基本结束。雨季已经来临，如何保证小麦安全入仓，还是一个值得注意的问题。
    加强秋田管理
    北方各省的广大农业生产合作社，现正积极进行春播作物的田间管理，努力争取秋季大丰收。山东省的临沂、济宁、菏泽、聊城、泰安等专区，已经结束了高粱、玉米、棉花的间苗、定苗工作，并普遍转向夏锄。黑龙江省的夏锄工作，已进入紧张阶段。这个省的呼兰、青冈、克东、勃利、依兰、集贤等县铲过头遍的地已占到三分之二以上，进度较快的拜泉、安达等县，头遍铲趟已基本结束，并进入二遍铲趟。河北、吉林、内蒙古等省、区，也已普遍展开夏锄工作。
    在进行夏锄的同时，不少地区还注意了施追肥和灭虫等工作。由于加强了春播作物的田间管理工作，再加最近气候转佳，部分地区成长不太好的棉花、高粱、玉米等幼苗，已开始由黄转青。
    目前存在的问题是：有的地区只顾夏收、夏种，放松了秋田管理；有的地区锄苗进度不平衡，锄的也很毛草；有的地区忽视除虫和施追肥。
    开展夏季积肥运动
    当前，正是早稻、中稻、棉花、玉米等作物需要追肥，晚稻和夏种作物需要底肥的时候。但据不少地区反映，肥料不足的问题较为严重。为了解决这个问题，许多地区展开了夏季积肥运动。湖南省每天投入割青草、沤绿肥和积土肥等活动的农民，有一百多万人。这个省的古丈、凤凰等县，在半个月内共积绿肥四百多万担。有些县发动农业社割青草沤肥以后，缺肥问题已经基本解决。
    在夏季积肥运动中，有的地区适当提高了农家肥的收购价格，使社员们乐于交出家肥；有的地区妥善地安排了劳动力，使社里有充足的力量投入积肥工作；有的地区以生产队为单位，订好积肥计划，再按人畜定量分配到户，定时、定质、定量完成任务。这样，就有力地推动了积肥运动，保证了积肥计划的胜利完成。有一些地区的积肥工作，直到现在还未很好开展起来。
    扑灭蝗虫
    到本月中旬为止，河南、河北、山东、江苏、安徽和天津等六个省、市的夏蝗发生和扩散面积，已达到一千一百二十多万亩。但经过各地采用药剂和人工大力防治，中央又派出飞机进行重点防治，上述大部地区的夏蝗防治任务，已经基本完成。
    在防治夏蝗工作中，由于阴雨连绵，影响药效，一般蝗蝻的死亡率仅达80％左右。现在，残蝗大部已变成虫。为了彻底消灭蝗虫，农业部已要求各地除必须迅速加强扫残工作外，还要注意残蝗产卵活动情况，划定秋蝗防治范围，及早作好准备，及时消灭秋蝗。
    争取糖料作物丰收
    今年，糖料作物的种植情况是：甘蔗没有完成各地提出的种植四百一十七万五千亩的计划（约差二十七万亩），但比去年多种植了六十万亩；甜菜基本上可以完成播种二百四十三万亩的计划，比去年扩大了二十二万亩。由于甘蔗重点产区今年低温多雨，再加上田间管理不够及时，蔗株的成长比较缓慢；甜菜的播种季节，亦因今年温度较低，比去年一般推迟了十天左右。目前，部分地区的甘蔗、甜菜田里已发生了虫害，缺苗现象也比较严重，这对于今年糖料作物的增产是不利的。
    为了争取糖料作物大丰收，广东、广西等省已分别召开了甘蔗生产座谈会和小型技术交流会，提出了查苗补苗、及时中耕追肥、防治虫害等措施；黑龙江、内蒙古实行了生产奖励办法，并充分供应治虫药械；吉林等省调整了甜菜收购价格，鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。目前，糖料作物产区的农民，正在积极进行田间管理工作。
