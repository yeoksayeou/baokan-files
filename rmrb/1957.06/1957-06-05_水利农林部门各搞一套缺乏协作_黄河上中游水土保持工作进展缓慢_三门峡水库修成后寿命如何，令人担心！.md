Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Junqian reports: The soil and water conservation work in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River provinces is progressing extremely slowly. This not only affects the Sanmenxia Reservoir project currently underway, but also the agricultural production of these provinces.

According to a recent inspection by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission: After a period of great development in the soil and water conservation work of the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River provinces last year, many areas have become inactive this year. Spring is the most suitable season for carrying out soil and water conservation work, and this year the task of soil and water conservation work is half less than last year, but according to incomplete statistics as of April 20, the completed soil and water conservation work only reached about 20% of the annual task, and some areas completed less than 10%. At this rate, this year's plan will be difficult to achieve.

The quality of soil and water conservation work in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River determines the lifespan of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and is closely related to agricultural production. Why is it that the Sanmenxia Reservoir is under construction and the movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture has begun, but the soil and water conservation work in these areas has instead slackened? The first reason is that the guiding principle is not clear. In the past, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission focused on using engineering to control soil erosion, the forestry department emphasized using afforestation to maintain soil and water, and the agricultural department considered improving farming techniques more, each doing their own thing, lacking coordination. Soil and water conservation is a complex and comprehensive task, and clarifying the working principles and dividing the working ratio of agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry is an urgent problem to be solved. Secondly, the soil and water conservation work institutions in various places are not sound, the tasks are not clear, the leadership methods are not appropriate, and the masses have not been well mobilized, relying on agricultural cooperatives to carry out work under a unified policy and arrangement, so that soil and water conservation work cadres often have nothing to do, and soil and water conservation work funds cannot be used in a timely manner, and even cadres are not proficient in soil and water conservation work. Third, many cadres and farmers in various places lack a correct understanding of the relationship between soil and water conservation work and agricultural production, and they have pitted the two against each other. After the slogan of striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year was put forward, many areas relaxed soil and water conservation work, and some even destroyed the soil and water conservation projects that had already been done. Some areas, in order to expand the area of cultivated land, disregarded soil and water conservation work and planted wheat on steep slopes of forty-two degrees. The Licun Agricultural Cooperative in Song County, Henan Province, removed more than 70% of the terraced field ridges, and the Luoyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party actually supported it. Some county leading cadres in Qinghai Province mistakenly believed that engaging in soil and water conservation work was not as certain to increase production as weeding in the fields. Some farmers in Shaanxi Province also inappropriately believe that the soil and water conservation work in the upper and middle reaches is only for the service of the downstream. Only the work of the soil and water conservation work institutions, lacking the cooperation of the rural work of the party and government at all levels, it is difficult to carry out soil and water conservation work in the vast areas.

    水利农林部门各搞一套缺乏协作
    黄河上中游水土保持工作进展缓慢
    三门峡水库修成后寿命如何，令人担心！
    新华社郑州3日电　新华社记者周君谦报道：黄河上、中游各省的水土保持工作进展极为迟缓。这不仅关系着正在进行的三门峡水库工程，而且将影响到这些省的农业生产。
    据黄河水利委员会最近检查的结果：黄河上、中游各省的水土保持工作在去年一度大发展后，今年有好多地区却消沉起来了。春季本来是开展水土保持工作最适宜的季节，同时今年水土保持工作的任务比去年少一半，但是到4月20日的不完全统计，已完成的水土保持工作只达到全年任务的20％左右，有的地区完成不到10％。照这样下去，今年的计划将难以实现。
    黄河上、中游地区水土保持工作的好坏，决定着三门峡水库寿命的长短，对农业生产也有密切的关系。为什么三门峡水库施工了，争取农业大丰收运动开展起来了，这些地区的水土保持工作反而松劲了呢？第一个原因是方针不明确。过去黄河水利委员会偏重于用工程来控制水土流失，林业部门强调用植树造林来保持水土，农业部门对改良耕作技术考虑的多，各搞一套，缺乏协作。水土保持工作是个复杂的综合性工作，明确工作方针和划分农、林、水、牧的工作比例，是当前急待解决的问题。其次，各地水土保持工作机构不健全，任务不明确，领导方法不适宜，又没有很好地发动群众，在统一的方针和安排下依靠农业社来开展工作，以致水土保持工作干部常常无事可做，水土保持工作经费也不能及时使用，甚至干部对水土保持工作不内行。第三，各地有不少干部和农民对水土保持工作和农业生产的关系缺乏正确的认识，把二者对立起来。在提出今年争取农业大丰收口号后，许多地区放松了水土保持工作，有的甚至破坏已经做好的水土保持工程。有些地区为了扩大耕地面积，不顾水土保持工作，在四十二度陡坡上种麦子。河南省嵩县李村农业社把梯田埂扒除了70％多，中共洛阳地方委员会竟给予支持。青海省有的县领导干部竟错误地认为，搞水土保持工作，不如到地里拔草对增产有把握。陕西省有些农民也不适当地认为，上、中游的水土保持工作仅仅是为下游服务。仅有水土保持工作机构的工作，缺乏各级党和政府农村工作的配合，广大地区的水土保持工作是难开展的。
