Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: According to a recent statistic from the Tokyo Credit Exchange, another sixty Japanese textile manufacturers went bankrupt in May. The Japanese textile industry is beginning to cry "June Crisis."

The number of Japanese textile manufacturers that went bankrupt in May was five more than in April, equivalent to four and a half times that of the same period last year. The Tokyo Credit Exchange estimates that even more textile manufacturers will close down in June.

Ten major textile companies, including Japan Wool Textile, Toa Boshoku, and Kanebo, have decided to reduce wool production by 30% for three months starting July 1, in an attempt to alleviate the crisis in the textile industry.

Japanese newspapers have pointed out that the crisis in the Japanese textile industry is due to "overproduction" and the recently implemented tight monetary policy.

    日本毛纺、东亚纺织、钟渊纺织等十大纺织公司已经决定从7月1日起的三个月减少毛纺产量30％，企图用来缓和一下纺织业的危机。
    日本报纸纷纷指出，日本纺织业危机的产生，是由于“生产过剩”和最近开始实行的紧缩金融政策。
