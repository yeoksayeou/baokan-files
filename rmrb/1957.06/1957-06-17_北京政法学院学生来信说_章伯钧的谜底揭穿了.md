　　Beijing University of Political Science and Law Students' Letter Says:
    Zhang Bojun's Riddle Revealed
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing—Students Ling Boquan, Yan Changbai, Chen Wenzhong, and Huang Guozhao from Beijing University of Political Science and Law wrote to our newspaper, saying: After reading the speech by Vice Chairman Shi Liang of the China Democratic League, Zhang Bojun's riddle has been solved. Zhang Bojun said to Vice Chairman Shi Liang: "Someone told me that Chu Anping's words hit the nail on the head. But I don't think there's a need to write an editorial. And repeatedly bringing up Lu Yuwen is unnecessary; Lu Yuwen is just a clown. In my opinion, Hu Feng and Chu Anping will become historical figures, and the so-called historical figures will be judged fairly hundreds of years later." May I ask Zhang Bojun: What is your intention in scolding Mr. Lu Yuwen, who insists on speaking justly and opposing reactionary remarks, as a clown, while praising anti-revolutionary Hu Feng and rightist Chu Anping as historical figures? At the symposium of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Mr. Wu Chengxi revealed that Zhang Bojun had long planned for the democratic parties to ideally develop to one or two million members, establishing an upper house. What does this illustrate? In my opinion, this illustrates: First, Zhang Bojun outwardly expresses support for the Communist Party and a willingness to follow the socialist road; in reality, he is engaged in activities opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism; second, Zhang Bojun's opposition to the Communist Party and opposition to socialism was prepared long ago. Not only was he prepared ideologically and theoretically, but he also made organizational preparations.
    Shen Ping, Zhao Shenghe, Liu Wulin, and Zhang Qiquan from the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres in Beijing wrote: The newspaper published Zhang Bojun's more than 300-word self-criticism. Logically, this self-criticism should be "sincere words" right? But in the self-criticism, apart from mentioning a few errors in a hollow way, he didn't touch on any thoughts. What's even more wonderful is that, along with his self-criticism, Vice Chairman Shi Liang's speech at the China Democratic League Central Small Group's symposium on the 13th revealed some of Zhang Bojun's "sincere words" behind the scenes, and Wu Chengxi of the China Democratic League Shanghai Municipal Committee revealed Shen Zhiyuan's conveying of Zhang Bojun's instructions. Comparing these two sets of "sincere words," Mr. Zhang Bojun's true colors are revealed. Is it better for Zhang Bojun to honestly admit his mistakes, or to persist in his errors and be insincere? Please, Mr. Zhang, tell us a few honest words!

### 北京政法学院学生来信说  章伯钧的谜底揭穿了

　　北京政法学院学生来信说
    章伯钧的谜底揭穿了
    本报讯　北京政法学院学生凌柏权、颜昌柏、陈文忠、黄国照给本报来信说：读了民盟副主席史良的发言以后，章伯钧的谜底得到了解答。章伯钧对史良副主席说：“有人对我说，储安平的话击中了要害。但我看是用不着写社论的。而且一再掮出卢郁文来，卢郁文这种人不过是一个小丑而已。我看，胡风、储安平倒要成为历史人物，所谓历史人物要几百年后自有定评。”请问章伯钧：把坚持说公正的话，反对反动言论的卢郁文先生骂为小丑，而把反革分命子胡风、右派分子储安平称赞为历史人物，其用心何在？在民盟上海市委会座谈会上，吴承禧先生揭发章伯钧早已策划民主党派最好发展到一两百万人，搞一个上议院。这又说明什么问题？我看，这说明了：第一、章伯钧表面上表示拥护共产党，愿意走社会主义的道路；实际上却干着反对共产党、反对社会主义的勾当；第二、章伯钧的反对共产党、反对社会主义，是早已有了准备的。不仅在思想上、理论上有了准备，而且作了组织上的准备。
    北京中央政法干部学校沈萍、赵生和、刘武林、张其泉来信说：报上登了章伯钧的三百多字的检讨，按理这个检讨应该是“由衷之言”了吧！但在检讨中，除了空洞的说了几个错误以外，没有接触到一点思想。更妙的是：与他的检讨同时登载的民盟中央小组13日座谈会上史良副主席的讲话中揭发章伯钧在背后的一些“由衷之言”，和民盟上海市委吴承禧揭发的沈志远转达的章伯钧的指示。把这两个“由衷之言”一对照，章伯钧先生的马脚就露出来了。章伯钧是老老实实承认错误好呢？还是坚持错误口是心非好呢？请章先生说几句老实话吧！
