A Few Ordinary Truths
Hua Luogeng

	I. Why do we forget so quickly!

	Recently, many infuriating statements have appeared. A small number of right-wing elements have taken advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to disseminate opinions against the dictatorship of the proletariat, against the leadership of the Communist Party, and against the socialist road. Some of these statements have even come from the leaders of certain democratic parties, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Chu Anping. This is a very surprising fact! Haven't their own half-lives of political activity been enough to make them realize the inevitable path of development for Chinese society? Even ordinary natural science workers, who were not very concerned about politics before liberation, now recognize this point, recognizing how the Chinese people have sought their own path for nearly a century, failing time and time again. They recognize that the leadership of the Communist Party today is the inevitable conclusion of China's history over the past century. Only since the Communist Party came to power have we embarked on the road of independence, democracy, and freedom. Who can deny that the people's living standards have improved since the Communist Party came to power? Who can deny that productivity has increased? Who can deny that our national defense strength has been strengthened? Who can deny that our international status has been enhanced! Compare it to all the governments in our history, and to all the governments of all countries in the world. Wouldn't you say that our progress is fast! Wouldn't you say our achievements are great! Ask your conscience, are we still not satisfied with such leadership?

	I repeat again, the leadership of the Communist Party was chosen by the Chinese people based on historical experience. The people's love for the Communist Party is due to the countless good deeds it has done. Of course, I am not saying that there are no mistakes at all on individual issues. But it can be said with certainty that achievements are the main thing, the fundamental thing! This is beyond doubt.

	The memory of the old society is still in the minds of the people throughout the country. Workers and farmers have expressed their anger at these reactionary statements based on their own personal experiences. For a scientific worker, we have not forgotten the situation under the Chiang Kai-shek regime, where we were unable to eat our fill, keep warm, and our expertise could not be brought into play and our work was not valued. Yes! To put it more definitely: if anyone dares to destroy the good environment we have gained, we, together with the people of the whole country, have the power to smash them to pieces. We are now, and we will always be, protecting the correct leadership of the Communist Party as we protect our own eyes.

	II. Under the guise of "anti-dogmatism"

	Now some people use the guise of anti-dogmatism to deny theoretical study and oppose Marxism, and sometimes they absurdly and vainly try to make some common-sense frameworks to restrain others. "Achievements are the main thing, shortcomings are secondary" cannot be said! Saying this is a formula! This is dogmatism. Heavens! What is the point of accumulating human knowledge! Isn't it to make it easier for future generations to use? Isn't it to further improve on this basis? The truths discovered in science become "dogmas" when expressed in sentences, but each one is not unconditional. Applying them when they are met, is precisely the advantage of these dogmas, misusing them when they are not met is "dogmatism." For example, the area of a triangle is equal to half the base times the height. This is a dogma, this is a formula, but those who measure small amounts of land use it countless times in their lives, and everything is consistent with the facts, what is dogmatic about it! But if we use this formula when measuring the large triangle of Beijing, Moscow, and New Delhi, then we are making the mistake of dogmatism, because then we should pay attention to the fact that the earth is a sphere! If it is really the case that "achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are secondary," what is dogmatic about using this sentence?

	Some people, under the cover of the slogan of "anti-dogmatism," have made some statements against theoretical study and against political study, believing that Marxism does not need to be studied, and isn't studying it just learning some dogmas? The purpose of such words from the right-wing elements is to try to undermine the socialist society, and for themselves, it is only enough to fool themselves. But what is most worrying is that it is said that some individual school's political teachers feel distressed, thinking that students feel that they are only teaching some dogmas and are not interested, and they are being labeled with the hat of dogmatism. They don't know that their job is precisely to introduce the basic principles of Marxism to students, to teach students the original and complete historical laws based on time and conditions, and to constantly remind everyone that Marxism is a lively and vigorous fighting force, and not to regard it as a rigid dogma. It is even more necessary to constantly refute the right-wing elements' attempts to lower or negate the value of studying Marxism.

	I know too little about Marxism, and the above views may be wrong, but I have benefited from recognizing the importance of Marxism from a smattering of knowledge! Therefore, when I see statements hindering learning, I feel extremely anxious.

	The right-wing elements do not want us to study Marxism, they just want us to put down our fighting weapons, we will not be fooled! Do not fall for their conspiracy of superficially opposing dogmatism, but in essence opposing Marxism. We strive to study, to study this Marxism that summarizes thousands of years of human experience, and we also sincerely advise them to study hard, but do not study with colored glasses.

	III. "Not knowing that there is a limit to 'Say everything you know'"

	What I said above, the right-wing elements may think is not in line with the facts; they are not not learning, look at how they write articles, so self-satisfied and brilliantly, when they speak, so happily and eloquently, Marxist terms may even be embellished a lot, but after reading the sentence "Not knowing that there is a limit to 'Say everything you know'," I suddenly realized that the brilliant writing and eloquence are only flowers before your eyes, just fancy tricks! The position determines the boundaries one feels. If the basic position is to oppose moving towards a socialist society, it is not surprising to say things that are not conducive to socialism; if the basic position is selfish and self-interested, and hopes to replace the interests of the people of the whole country with the interests of a small group of people, then why not let the Communist Party give up its leadership and let them replace it? Of course, they will not even think about what problems their rule will bring to the people. The more they think, the more they are blinded by subjectivity, and eventually they will not even think about whether the people will let them act recklessly! From such a position of learning, it will inevitably lead to plagiarizing some terms to decorate the facade, it will inevitably lead to illusions, and when they hear the sounds of anti-sectarianism, anti-bureaucratism, and anti-subjectivism, they think that a storm is coming and they can fish in troubled waters. But what is certain is: the fish has not been caught, but the position has been exposed, revealing a fox's tail.

	Take advantage of this opportunity to do some minor surgery! Cut off the tail and stand firm! I hope that when we breathe our last breath, we can ask ourselves, what role has this life played in socialism? Has it done its best to promote it, or has it exerted a force to pull it back? At that time, if "achievements are the main thing," I think we all will not have lived in vain!

	Saints have too many faults, but are brave to correct them; sages have too few faults, and are also not afraid to correct them; villains have no faults, so they don't need to correct them. Covering up mistakes is not the time now. The eyes of the masses are discerning.

### 几点平常的道理

　　几点平常的道理
　　华罗庚
    一、为什么忘记得这么快！
    最近出现了不少令人愤慨的言论，少数的右派分子利用了党整风的机会散布出反对无产阶级专政，反对共产党领导，反对走社会主义道路的言论。这些言论有些竟出自若干民主党派的领导人之口，如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平等人。这是十分令人惊异的事实！难道他们自己的半世的政治生活还不足以使他们认识到中国社会发展的必由的道路吗？就以一般的自然科学工作者来说，解放前他们都不十分关心政治的，而今天也都认识到了这一点，认识到近百年来，中国人民怎样地寻求自己道路，怎样的一次一次又一次地失败。认识到今天共产党的领导是我国近百年史的必然结论。自从有了共产党我们才走上了独立民主自由的道路。谁能否认，自从共产党执政以来人民的生活水平提高了；谁能否认，生产力增加了；谁能否认，我国的国防力量加强了；谁能否认，我国的国际地位提高了！比比看，和我国历史上的一切的政府比，和全世界的一切国家的政府比，我们的进步算不算快！成绩算不算大！问一问良心，这样的领导，我们还不满意吗？
    再重复一句，共产党的领导是中国人民根据历史经验挑选了的。人民对共产党的爱戴，是由于他做了无数好事。当然我没有说，在个别问题上丝毫没有错误。但肯定的可以说：成绩是主要的，是基本的！这是无可怀疑的。
    全国人民对旧社会的记忆还存，工人们农人们都从他们的切身体验中发出了反驳这些反动言论的愤怒之声了，对一个科学工作者来说：也没有忘掉在蒋介石政权下，食不饱，衣不暖，专长不能发挥，工作不被重视的情况。是的！说更肯定一些：如果有人胆敢把我们已得的好环境破坏，和全国人民在一起，我们有力量能把他们打击得粉碎的。我们现在是，我们永远是爱护正确领导的共产党如同爱护自己的眼珠一样的。
    二、在“反教条主义”的幌子下
    现在有些人用反教条主义的幌子来否定理论的学习来反对马克思主义，有时又荒唐地枉费心机地想做出一些毫无常识的框子来束缚旁人。“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”不能说了！说这是公式！这是教条。天呀！人类积累知识是干什么的！难道不是为了使后人更易于运用吗？不是为了在这基础上可以进一步提高吗？科学上发现的真理用语句表达出来就成为“教条”，但是每一条都不是毫无条件的，合于条件的应用，正是有这些教条的好处，不合于条件的乱用才是“教条主义”。例如：三角形的面积等于高乘底的一半，这是教条，这是公式，但丈量小量土地的人用了一生不知其千百万次，而事事与事实相符合，有何教条之有呢！但如果测量北京，莫斯科，新德里大三角形的时候，我们用了这一个公式，那就犯了教条主义的错误了，因为那就应当注意到地球是球面这一事实了！如果真的是“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”，用了这一句话又有何教条之有呢？
    有人在“反教条主义”这个口号的掩护下，做了些反对理论学习反对政治学习的言论，认为马克思主义不要学习了，学了它还不是学了些教条吗？右派分子的这种言词的目的，对社会主义社会来说，是企图挖墙脚，对它们自己来说，适足以自愚而已。但是最可焦虑的是：据说有些个别学校的政治教员感到苦闷，认为学生们觉得他们仅仅是讲授些教条而不感到兴趣，而给他们戴上教条主义的帽子，殊不知他们的工作正是把马克思主义基本原理介绍给学生，把历史上所获得的这些规律的源源本本，根据时间条件分析地教给学生，时常提醒大家，马克思主义是生动活泼的战斗力量，而不要把它认为僵死的教条。更要时常驳斥右派分子降低或否定学习马克思主义的价值。
    对马克思主义我知道得太少了，以上的看法可能是错误的，但是从一知半解中认识到马克思主义的重要性，自己得益了！因此看到了阻挠学习的言论，就感到异常地焦虑不安。
    右派分子们不要我们学习马克思主义，就是要我们放下战斗武器，我们不上他们的当！不要中了他们表面上是反教条主义，而骨子里是反马克思主义的阴谋诡计，我们努力学习，学习这总结了人类几千年来的经验的马克思主义，同时我们也诚恳地劝告他们好好地学习，但不要带着有色眼镜学习。
    三、“不晓得知无不言本身有个界限”
    我以上所说的，右派分子也许认为与事实不符；他们并不是不学，你看他们写起文章来，那么自得其乐地妙笔生花，发起言来那么兴高彩烈地舌翻莲花，马克思主义的词令有时可能还点缀得不少呢，但看了“不晓得知无不言本身有个界限”之句，才恍然大悟，原来笔花、莲花都是眼前花、枪花而已，立场决定了自己所感觉到的界限，如果基本立场是反对走向社会主义社会的，一点也不奇怪会说出不利于社会主义的话来；如果基本立场是自私自利的，是希望以一小撮人的利益来代替全国人民的利益的，那又何妨要共产党放弃领导，由他们来代替呢。当然他们更不会想到，他们执政会给人民带来些什么问题了。愈想愈为主观所蒙蔽，最终也不会想到人民让不让他们胡作非为了！由这样的立场进行学习，势必致于去剽窃些词令来装璜门面，势必致于产生错觉，听到了反宗派主义反官僚主义和反主观主义的风声雨声，就认为狂飙将至，可以混水摸鱼了。但肯定的是：鱼没有摸着，但是立场暴露了，露出了一条狐狸尾巴。
    利用这一次的机会，行一些小小手术吧！割掉尾巴，站稳立场吧！希望在我们呼吸最后一口空气的时候，反躬自问，这一生对社会主义所起的作用如何？还是尽了推进之力，还是出了后拉之力，到那时候，如果“成绩是主要”，我想我们大家就不虚度此生了！
    圣人过多，而勇于改；贤人过少，也勿惮改；小人无过，固毋须改。文过饰非，非其时矣。群众的眼睛是雪亮的。
