    The United States Prepares to Back It Up
    Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: Beirut dispatch: Lebanese newspapers reported on the 27th that a "hair-trigger" situation has formed on the Syrian-Israeli border. Newspapers stated that Israeli troops were massing in the Tiberias Lake region.
    The "Political News," published by former Prime Minister Yafi, reported that, according to well-informed diplomatic sources, the U.S. Sixth Fleet was ordered on the 26th at noon to assemble in a certain location in the Mediterranean, preparing to intervene in the event of an armed conflict on the Syrian-Israeli border. It is said that "a certain location" refers to Beirut.
    The newspaper said: "These people are worried that Israel may launch a blitz attack on Syria so that the Sixth Fleet can intervene."
    When asked about this news, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said that it had not received any information about the Sixth Fleet taking such action. Officials at the U.S. Navy Department in Washington denied reports that the U.S. Sixth Fleet had received orders to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean.

　　以色列窥伺叙利亚
    美国准备在后面押阵
    新华社28日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩报纸27日说，在叙利亚—以色列边境形成了“一触即发”的局势。报纸说，以色列军队集结在台柏拉斯湖地区。
    前总理雅非所办的“政治报”报道，据消息灵通的外交人士说，美国第六舰队26日中午奉令在地中海某地聚结，准备在一旦叙以边境发生武装冲突时进行干涉。据说，“某地”指的是贝鲁特。
    这家报纸说：“这些人士担心，以色列可能对叙利亚进行闪电攻击，以使第六舰队能够进行干涉。”
    贝鲁特的美国大使馆在被问到这些消息的时候说，它没有得到关于第六舰队采取这样的行动的消息。华盛顿的美国海军部官员否认关于美国第六舰队已经接到命令开往东地中海的消息。
