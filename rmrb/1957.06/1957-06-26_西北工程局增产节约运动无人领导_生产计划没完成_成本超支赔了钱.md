　　Northwest Engineering Bureau's Production Increase and Economy Drive Lacks Leadership
    Production Plans Unfulfilled, Cost Overruns Result in Losses
    (Our newspaper's reporter Li Qian reports) The various engineering companies under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering (hereafter referred to as the Northwest Management Bureau) have had very poor performance in fulfilling their plans this year. From January to May, this bureau only completed 33.18% of the total annual output value plan; since the second quarter, they have failed to meet the plan every month. Specifically, they completed 95% of the monthly plan in April, 89.1% in May, and are expected to complete at most 85% in June. The bureau's loss situation is also very serious. From January to April, not only did they fail to achieve the 6% cost reduction target, but they also suffered a loss of more than 1.67 million yuan, accounting for 5.85% of the actual total workload completed (the loss figures for May have not yet been calculated; judging from the actual work situation, it is no better than the first four months). This figure is still calculated according to the old 1956 quotas and prices; if calculated according to the new 1957 quotas and prices, the losses would be even greater.
    The tasks undertaken by the Northwest Management Bureau this year are only equivalent to about 60% of the actual workload completed last year. However, in terms of construction forces, in addition to reducing some general workers and transferring some surplus cadres and technical workers for training, the main technical forces and construction machinery have basically not been reduced much; and the main construction materials are not as tight as last year. Given such good construction conditions, why is the Northwest Management Bureau failing to complete its production plans and incurring such large losses? In addition to the objective reason of more changes in this year's tasks, the main reason is that the leaders of this bureau do not pay enough attention to the production increase and economy drive, resulting in this movement not being fully launched throughout the bureau system. Since December of last year, the leadership of the Northwest Management Bureau has frequently shouted "take the production increase and economy drive as the central task," but this movement has been in a state of no one being responsible. Among the leaders, although the work of leading the production increase and economy drive was assigned to a deputy director and a deputy secretary of the Party committee, they have never seriously taken up this work. Even the instructions of the CCP Central Committee on carrying out the production increase and economy drive were not discussed once by the bureau's Party committee, but were only circulated among the Party committee members and then filed away. The production increase and economy plan of this bureau was drafted and formulated by individual departments and individual cadres. Although it has been revised four times, it has not been issued to the various companies until now because the leaders have not seriously led and paid attention to this work. The Basic Construction Department of the CCP Xi'an Municipal Committee has repeatedly requested the Party committee of this bureau to discuss the instructions of the Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees on carrying out the production increase and economy drive, and to inspect this work, but this bureau has never seriously implemented it.
    Because the leadership of the Northwest Management Bureau relaxed its leadership over the production increase and economy drive, the leaders of the various companies under the bureau have also not seriously led the production increase and economy drive. For example, the Party committee and administrative leadership of the Northwest First Engineering Company have not specifically studied the work of increasing production and practicing economy from January to May, and there is no clear division of labor for leading the production increase and economy drive. Therefore, although this company issued a production increase and economy plan (draft) in April to solicit the opinions of cadres, and the cadres below also put forward many suggestions for revision, it has not been revised until now.
    Since the production increase and economy plan has not met with the broad masses, tens of thousands of directly producing workers have only listened to some mobilization reports on carrying out the production increase and economy drive, and have not received specific production increase and economy tasks. Grassroots cadres also feel that there is no way to start the work of increasing production and practicing economy. In addition to mobilizing workers to clean up the site and pick up odds and ends of materials such as clout nails, the production increase and economy drive, which revolves around the key to production, has not yet been launched in most companies and construction sites. For example, the Third Construction Area of the Northwest First Engineering Company did not launch a production increase and economy drive around key production issues from January to May, and not only did it fail to complete the cost reduction plan, but it also suffered a loss of 190,000 yuan, accounting for 10% of the actual workload completed by this construction area; among them, 55 tons of asphalt were wasted in the construction of No. 2 and No. 5 factory buildings alone.
    Another reason why the Northwest Management Bureau system fails to complete production plans and incurs losses is that the leaders of this bureau, from top to bottom, have a blindly optimistic attitude towards this year's production. They believe that the construction force is large and the task is small, and there is no problem in completing the plan, so they have relaxed their leadership over production. Last year, the leaders of the Northwest Management Bureau closely monitored the completion of plans by the lower levels, and convened a production inspection meeting with the managers of various companies every ten days to promptly praise and criticize. This year, in order to reduce meetings, it was decided to hold a production inspection meeting once a month, but so far, only two production inspection meetings have been held in almost half a year. The leaders of the companies generally do not pay close attention to production. In some companies we visited, there were many cases where meetings were not specifically held to study production issues for one or two months or even longer. Some companies did not arrange work according to the spirit of "rectification and production must not be neglected" in April and May, but put rectification in the first place, democratic management in the second place, and production in the third place. At present, although some companies have begun to pay attention to correcting the situation of relaxing leadership over production, there has been no significant improvement.

### 西北工程局增产节约运动无人领导  生产计划没完成  成本超支赔了钱

　　西北工程局增产节约运动无人领导
    生产计划没完成  成本超支赔了钱
    本报讯  记者李茜报道：建筑工程部西北工程管理总局（以下简称西管局）所属各工程公司今年以来完成计划的情况很不好。这个局1至5月份只完成全年总产值计划的33.18％；第二季度以来，更是月月完不成计划，其中4月份完成月计划95％，5月份完成89.1％，6月份预计最多只能完成85％。这个局的亏本情况也非常严重。1至4月份不但没有完成6％的降低成本计划，反而亏损了一百六十七万多元，占实际完成总工作量的5.85％（5月份亏损数字至今没有计算出来，从实际工作情况来看，比前四个月也没有好转）。这个数字还是按1956年旧定额、旧价格计算的，如果按1957年新定额、新价格计算，亏损的还要多。
    西管局今年承担的任务只相当于去年实际完成工作量的60％左右，但是在施工力量方面，除减少了一些普工，并抽调出一部分多余的干部和技术工人进行培训以外，主要技术力量和施工机械基本上没有减多少；主要建筑材料，也不像去年那样紧张。既然有这样好的施工条件，西管局为什么反而完不成生产计划，并且亏损那么多呢？除了今年任务变更较多的客观原因以外，主要原因是这个局的领导人员对增产节约运动不够重视，致使这一运动在全局系统没有全面开展起来。从去年12月份以来，西管局的领导方面就经常喊“把增产节约运动作为中心工作”，但是，增产节约运动却一直处于无人负责的状态。在领导人员当中，虽然分工由一个副局长和一个党委副书记领导增产节约运动，但是他们一直没有认真抓起这一工作来。甚至连中共中央关于开展增产节约运动的指示，局党委都没有讨论过一次，只是由党委委员们传阅了一下，就存档了。这个局的增产节约方案，是由个别部门和个别干部起草制订的，先后虽然修改了四次，但是由于领导人员没有认真领导和重视这一工作，直到现在还没有发到各公司去。中共西安市委基本建设部曾经先后几次要求这个局的党委讨论中央和省、市委关于开展增产节约运动的指示，并检查这一工作，但是这个局一直没有认真执行。
    由于西管局领导方面放松了对增产节约运动的领导，局属各公司的领导人员也一直没有认真领导增产节约运动。例如，西北第一工程公司的党委和行政领导方面，在1至5月份都没有专门研究过增产节约工作，对增产节约运动的领导也没有明确分工。因此，这个公司虽然在4月份订出了增产节约方案（草案），发到下边征求干部的意见，下面的干部也提出了很多修改意见，但是直到现在还没有修改出来。
    由于增产节约的方案没有同广大群众见面，数万直接生产的工人只是听了一些有关开展增产节约运动的动员报告，而没有接到具体的增产节约任务。基层干部也感到增产节约工作无从下手。除发动工人清理现场，拾拾洋钉等零星材料以外，围绕生产关键进行的增产节约运动，在大部分公司、工地都还没有开展起来。例如，西北第一工程公司第三工区1至5月份由于没有围绕生产关键问题开展增产节约运动，不但没有完成降低成本的计划，反而亏损了十九万元，占这个工区实际完成工作量的10％；其中仅在二号和五号厂房施工中，就浪费了五十五吨沥青。
    西管局系统完不成生产计划和亏本的另一个原因，是这个局从上到下的领导人员对今年的生产都抱着盲目乐观情绪。他们认为施工力量大，任务小，完成计划没问题，因此就放松了对生产的领导。去年，西管局领导人员对下边完成计划情况抓的很紧，每旬召集各公司经理开一次生产检查会议，及时进行表扬和批评。今年为了减少会议，决定每月开一次生产检查会，但是，到目前为止，差不多半年的时间才只开了两次生产检查会议。公司的领导一般对生产也抓的不紧，在我们访问的一些公司中，一两个月甚至更多的时间没有专门开会研究生产问题的也不少。有些公司在4、5月份没有根据生产整风两不误的精神安排工作，而是把整风放在第一位，民主管理放在第二位，生产放在第三位。目前，有些公司虽然开始注意纠正放松对生产领导的情况，但是还没有显著的改进。
