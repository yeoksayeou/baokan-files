    Giant-Eared, Multi-Grain Wheat
    A teacher of agricultural fundamentals at Chongqing Statistical School, Zhao Shijing, has been conducting teaching experiments for several years. Since 1955, he has been using wheat 51-1355 and asexual hybridization of Yangqu Golden Queen corn (using embryo grafting) and has now cultivated a giant-eared, multi-grain wheat variety. (See picture)
    This wheat has thick and strong stalks, broad and thick leaves, strong resistance to rust, and the ears are 15-19 cm long, with the longest being 20.6 cm, twice as long as the local longest "youtiao" wheat. Each ear of giant-eared, multi-grain wheat has 27-33 spikelets, many spikelets have 10-12 florets, bearing eight to nine grains. Some grow double ears on one node (see picture), with 144 to 217 grains per ear. Some also have six to seven side stems branching out from the nodes on the upper part of the main stem, each producing an ear.  (Zhao Shijing)

    巨穗多粒的小麦
    重庆统计学校农业基础学科教师几年来结合教学试验栽培，从1955年起用小麦51—1355和阳曲金皇后玉米无性杂交（用胚芽嫁接），现已育成一种巨穗多粒小麦。（见图）
    这种小麦，植株茎秆粗壮，叶宽厚，抗锈病力强，穗长15—19公分，最长20.6公分，较当地最长的油条麦长二倍。巨穗多粒小麦每穗有27—33个小穗，许多小穗有10—12朵花，结实八至九粒，有些在一个节上长双穗（见图），每穗粒数一百四十四至二百一十七粒，有些还在主茎地上部茎节上分出六至七侧茎，并抽穗。  （赵世经）
