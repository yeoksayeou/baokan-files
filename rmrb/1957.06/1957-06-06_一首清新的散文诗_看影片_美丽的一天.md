    A Fresh Prose Poem
    ——Watching the Film “A Beautiful Day”
    Li Xin
    The story of the film “A Beautiful Day” is very simple: a young woman who graduated from a music academy is unwilling to waste her youth sitting in an office. She leaves the city and comes to a farm, longing to make a difference. Life is not as smooth as she imagined. She encounters setbacks and becomes discouraged; but with the encouragement of the masses, she finally perseveres. Finally, on a beautiful day, her beautiful hope is realized! The band and chorus she conducts perform in the newly built club, and happy love also matures on this day.

    The characters in the film are also familiar to us: the pampered and imaginative Katyusha; the farm chairman Koleda who only knows how to pursue production achievements and ignores the cultural life of the masses; the proud Shashko brothers; the intellectual Bugakin who is restless in his work… Because of their different attitudes towards life, some have moved forward and grown with the tide of life; while others have been eliminated by life.

    Although we are all very familiar with this, when the lights in the cinema come on, people stand up from their seats with happy smiles on their faces.

    Why does this ordinary story give people such a fresh feeling?

    It’s like writing an article, the same thing written by different writers will have completely different moods, either majestic, or graceful, or gorgeous… and various different styles of works will give readers different artistic enjoyment. Although “A Beautiful Day” cannot be regarded as a particularly successful film, it has a unique style due to the artist's ingenuity. If compared to an article, it can be said to be a fresh prose poem, a timeless and thought-provoking sketch. After reading a large number of more serious articles, we feel particularly fresh and delightful when we occasionally read a light and fluent short work.

    The film uses some narration by commentators. These narrations are humorous and playful, cleverly playing a connecting role at the turning points of the plot, while also setting off the film's comedic atmosphere and increasing the appeal of the plot. The film uses sketching techniques, unfolding a portrait of characters in front of the audience from the beginning. With the commentator's explanation, it arouses people's suspense about the fate of the characters. Shashko and Gley walk hand in hand, looking very happy. Why does the commentator say "Don't envy them yet"? The district committee secretary is contemplating in the quiet night. Why does the commentator question whether he is thinking about work or thinking about girls? This method of expression easily reminds people of the style of Gogol's novels. Doesn't the large amount of lyrical and humorous descriptive narration greatly increase the artistic charm of the novel?

    In this film, there are no intense conflicts and no detailed psychological portrayals. With just a few strokes, the outlines of the characters are very clear. The creators are not without criticism of their characters, but at the same time as criticizing them, they also caress them very much. He does not whip them, nor does he preach to them head-on. He lets them learn lessons in life and transform naturally.

    The actors' performances and music are also very coordinated with the style of the entire film. Actress Savinova, who plays Katyusha, has talking eyebrows and expressive eyes. Whether she frowns or smiles, she deeply attracts the audience. Particularly wonderful is the scene where she asks the accountant to buy musical instruments. She lists the names of the instruments, and she herself is immersed in the music. One moment she pretends to play the piano, the next she gets up and dances. At this time, the music also plays the sounds of various instruments. The audience can't help but laugh when they see this infatuated girl.

    We have seen too many films with the same themes and similar stories, and even more films where no matter what the story is, the style is always the same. How much we hope that our own films will also become diversified!

    一首清新的散文诗
    ——看影片“美丽的一天”
    李欣
    影片“美丽的一天”的故事是很简单的：一个音乐学院毕业的年青姑娘，不愿意坐在办公室里浪费青春，离开城市，来到农庄，渴望着能有所作为。生活不像想像中那样一帆风顺，她碰到挫折，气馁了；但是在群众的鼓励下，终于坚持下来。最后，在一个美好的日子里，美好的希望实现了！她指挥的乐队和歌队在新盖的俱乐部里举行演出，幸福的爱情也在这一天成熟。
    影片中的人物也是我们熟悉的：娇生惯养、富于幻想的卡秋莎；只知追求生产成绩，不理会群众文化生活的农庄主席柯列达；骄傲的沙什柯兄弟；不安于工作的知识分子布加金……。他们由于各自对生活的态度不同，有的随着生活的潮流前进了，成长了；有的却被生活所淘汰。
    尽管这一切我们都非常熟悉，但是，当电影院里的灯亮了，人们从座位上站起来的时候，脸上都露出喜悦的微笑。
    为什么这一个平常的故事给人十分新鲜的感觉呢？
    好像写文章一样，同样的事情出自不同作家的手笔，就会具有完全不同的情调，或则雄浑，或则清隽，或则绮丽……，而各种不同风格的作品，也就给予读者以不同的艺术享受。“美丽的一天”虽然不能算是一部特别成功的影片，但是，由于艺术家的独具匠心，它却有一种特有的风格。如果拿文章来比，它可以说是清新的散文诗，是隽永而耐人寻味的小品。在我们读过大量比较严肃的文章之后，偶然一读轻松流利的短作品，会感到分外清新可喜。
    影片运用了一些解说员的旁白，这些旁白幽默而俏皮，在情节转换的地方巧妙地起着衔接作用，同时又烘托出了影片的喜剧气氛，增加了情节的感染力。影片运用速写手法，一开始就在观众面前展开了人物群像，随着解说员的解说，引起人们对人物命运的悬念。沙什柯和葛列手挽手地走着，看起来很幸福，为什么解说员要说“暂时还别羡慕”？区委书记在静静的夜晚沉思，为什么解说员发出疑问说他是在想工作，或是在想姑娘？这种表现方法很容易使人联想起果戈里的小说的笔调，那大量抒情的、幽默的旁白似的描述不是大大增加了小说的艺术魅力么？
    在这部影片里，没有剧烈的矛盾冲突，没有细致的心理刻划。寥寥几笔，而人物的轮廓却十分清晰。创作者对他的人物并不是没有批判的，但在批判的同时，他又十分爱抚他们。他不鞭打他们，也没有对他们进行正面的说教，他让他们在生活中接受教训，自然而然地转变了。
    演员的表演和音乐也和整个影片的风格非常协调。演员沙维诺娃扮演的卡秋莎，有着会说话的眉毛，善于表情的眼睛。不论她皱眉或者微笑，都深深地吸引着观众。特别精彩的，是她向会计师要求买乐器这一段戏。她历历数着乐器的名字，自己也沉醉到音乐中去了。一忽儿作弹琴状，一忽儿起身旋舞。而这时音乐也奏出了各种乐器的声音。观众看着这个如痴如醉的女孩子，不由得不笑起来。
    我们看过太多题材相同，故事大同小异的影片，更看过太多不论什么故事、风格却总是千篇一律的影片，我们多么希望我们自己的影片也变得多样化起来啊！
