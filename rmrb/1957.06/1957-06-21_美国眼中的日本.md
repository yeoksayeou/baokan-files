　　America's View of Japan
　　Li Budiao
　　Will Girard, the American soldier who killed the Japanese woman Sakai in the Somagahara military base, ultimately get away with it like Reynolds, who killed Liu Ziran in Taiwan?

　　The Japanese people have consistently demanded that this American soldier, who took pleasure in shooting Japanese people, be handed over to the Japanese courts for trial. Otherwise, these murderers, cultivated in an environment of racial discrimination, will treat yellow-skinned Japanese people as their live targets, just like the KKK kills black people, and kill them at will. This demand of the Japanese people is entirely justified. No self-respecting nation can allow foreign troops to act lawlessly on their own soil in this way.

　　The United States initially refused to hand Girard over to the Japanese court, arguing that he was "on duty" when he killed her. However, after the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan, the pressure from the Japanese people on the United States greatly increased. Fearing that the same event would occur in Japan, the United States had to make concessions. On June 4, Dulles and Defense Secretary Wilson issued a joint statement agreeing to hand the murderer Girard over to the Japanese court for trial.

　　In the statement, Dulles and Wilson acknowledged that the Somagahara base was a jointly used area by the Japanese and American armies. Girard's task at the time was to guard some equipment. He was not ordered to shoot. The killed Sakai was thirty yards away from him. Sakai was walking away when Girard fired.

　　After this statement was issued, some Americans immediately came out to oppose it. New York lawyer Carroll, with the support of some members of Congress, submitted a petition to Federal Judge McGrakey, demanding that Girard be returned to the United States. The reasons Carroll put forward were full of the arrogant and domineering attitude of imperialists. He said that the base where the shooting occurred was under "American sovereign jurisdiction." The crime committed by Girard was "only a crime against the United States and not against Japan."

　　What a great insult to the Japanese people! The American base in Japan is actually American territory, and sovereignty belongs to the United States! Carroll obviously sees Japan as inferior to the Philippines. Because in the Philippines, the United States had to admit that the sovereignty of the American base belongs to the Philippines. And the Japanese people have become American subjects! When Japanese people are killed by Americans, it is not Japan that is violated, but the United States! To put it more bluntly, Carroll's words mean that Japan is a colony under American rule, so the Japanese people are at the mercy of the United States, and it is certainly not illegal for Americans to kill people there.

　　Carroll's fallacy is representative. An editorial published in "The New York Times" on June 6 also demanded that the Japanese court give up its right to try Girard. It said that the issue was not whether Girard was guilty or not, but that the Japanese court's trial would damage the "morale and discipline" of the American army. It turns out that the morale and discipline of the American army rely on allowing American soldiers to kill, loot, and plunder abroad. No wonder Army Secretary Brucker and the most reactionary group of congressmen opposed handing Girard over to the Japanese court for trial.

　　Now, McGrakey has overturned Dulles and Wilson's promise and has ruled that the murderer Girard must not be handed over to the Japanese court for trial. Japan's national sovereignty and national dignity have been so insulted by an American judge. This is the result of the Japanese ruling group's following the American war policy. Of course, the Japanese people will never agree. The struggle is still ahead. However, in such a tortuous process, people can see that behind the grand diplomatic rhetoric of the US State Department, the United States regards Asian countries with US military bases as nothing more than American colonies.

　　美国眼中的日本
　　李不雕
    在相马原军事基地杀死日本妇女坂井中的美国兵哲腊德，将终于像在台湾杀死刘自然的雷诺那样得以逍遥法外吗？
    日本人民一直要求把这个以枪杀日本人取乐的美国兵交给日本法庭审判。否则的话，在实行种族歧视的环境下培养出来的这些杀人犯们，将会像三K党杀害黑人一样，把黄色皮肤的日本人当作他们的活靶子，任意加以杀害。日本人民的这种要求是完全正当的。没有一个有自尊心的民族能够听任外国军队在自己的国土上这样横行不法。
    美国最初拒绝把哲腊德交给日本法庭，理由是他杀人的时候是在“执行任务”。但是在台湾人民举行反美大示威以后，日本人民对美国的压力大大加强了。美国害怕在日本发生同样的事件，不能不作了让步。6月4日，杜勒斯和国防部长威尔逊发表联合声明，同意把杀人犯哲腊德交给日本法庭审讯。
    杜勒斯和威尔逊在声明里承认，相马原基地是日本和美国军队共同使用的地区。哲腊德当时执行的任务是看守一些装备。他并没有奉命开枪。被打死的坂井中在离他三十码以外。在哲腊德开枪时，坂井中是朝外走的。
    在这个声明发表以后，美国立刻有人出来反对。纽约律师卡罗尔在一些国会议员的支持下，向联邦法官麦克格拉基提出一项呈文，要求把哲腊德解回美国去。卡罗尔提出的理由，充满了帝国主义分子的嚣张跋扈的气味。他说，发生枪杀事件的基地，是在“美国主权管辖之下”的。哲腊德所犯的罪行，“只能是侵犯美国的而不是侵犯日本的”罪行。
    这对日本人民是多么大的侮辱！在日本的美国基地，竟是美国的领土，主权归美国所有！卡罗尔把日本显然看得比菲律宾都不如。因为在菲律宾，美国都不能不承认美国基地的主权属于菲律宾。而日本人民，竟然成了美国的臣民！日本人被美国人杀了，受到侵犯的竟然不是日本而是美国！卡罗尔的话说得更直率一点，就是说日本是美国统治下的殖民地，因此日本人是美国的俎上之肉，美国人在那里杀人，当然是不犯法的。
    卡罗尔的这种谬论是有代表性的。“纽约时报”在6月6日发表的一篇社论，也要求日本法庭放弃对哲腊德的审判权。它说，问题不在于哲腊德有罪无罪，而是在于日本法庭的审判，会损害美国军队的“士气和纪律”。原来，美国军队的士气和纪律，就是依靠放任美国军人在国外杀人越货来维持的。无怪乎美国陆军部长布鲁克和国会里最反动的一批议员们要反对把哲腊德交给日本法庭审判了。
    现在，麦克格拉基推翻了杜勒斯和威尔逊的诺言，已经判决杀人犯哲腊德不得交给日本法庭审判。日本的国家主权和民族尊严，竟然这样遭到一个美国法官的侮弄。这是日本统治集团追随美国战争政策所招来的结果。当然，日本人民是决不会答应的。斗争还在前面。不过，在这样一个曲折的过程中间，人们倒可以看出，在美国国务院的冠冕堂皇的外交词令后面，美国把有美国军事基地的亚洲国家都看成不过是美国的殖民地而已。
