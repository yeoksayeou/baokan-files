　　Last Year's Hebei Flood Was the Worst in Years
　　Unified Purchase and Supply Prevented Starvation
　　*People's Daily*, Baoding, 13th – Members of the Nan Dayuan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Baoding unanimously opposed Ge Peiqi's unfounded statement that "unified purchase and supply has messed things up." Guo Shunxing, the cooperative's director, said: If it weren't for unified purchase and supply, last year's major flood would have starved countless people. He said: Hebei Province experiences frequent floods. In the past, every flood was an opportunity for landlords, wealthy people, and grain merchants to make a fortune, while farmers could only flee and starve. Last year's flood was the worst in years, but thanks to the leadership of the Party and the implementation of the unified purchase and supply policy, no one starved to death. Furthermore, our living standards, despite frequent floods, have been improving year by year. For example, my family used to live hand to mouth, rarely eating white flour. Now, not only can we eat white flour every month, but we also frequently buy meat on New Year's, holidays, and Sundays. Production team leader Zhao Liangtian added: Ge Peiqi asked where the pork went; we said the people ate it. In our village, only a few wealthy families used to buy meat. We farmers couldn't even afford flour, let alone meat. Now, everyone in the village eats meat not only during New Year's and holidays but also regularly. Because more people are eating meat, we should raise more pigs. Last year, our cooperative raised over 300 pigs, and this year, we have expanded to over 500. Our lives are improving year by year. Why does Ge Peiqi spread rumors without looking at the facts? I am sure he has ulterior motives.

　　去年河北水灾比那一年都大
　　因为统购统销才没有饿死人
    本报保定13日电　保定市郊南大园农业社社员一致反对葛佩琦的“统购统销搞坏了”这种毫无事实根据的说法。社主任郭顺兴说：要不是统购统销，去年的一次大水灾，不知要饿死多少人。他说：河北省水灾多，过去每来一次水灾，地主老财粮商就乘机发大财，农民只有到处逃荒和挨饿。去年的水灾比过去那一年都大，但是因为有了党的领导，实行了统购统销政策，一个人也没有饿死。再拿我们的生活来说，虽然常遭水灾，但是生活都是一年比一年提高。像我家过去是吃了这顿没那顿，一年也吃不上一次白面。现在不光每月都能吃上白面，过年过节和过星期天还要经常买肉吃。生产队长赵良田接着说：葛佩琦问猪肉那里去了，我们说是人民大家吃了。像我们村的人，过去只有几家大老财买肉吃，俺们农民们不说吃肉，连面都吃不上。现在全村人们不光过年过节要吃肉，平常还要吃肉呢。因为吃肉的人多了，就应该多养猪，去年俺们社喂了三百多口猪，今年就发展到五百多口猪。我们的生活是一年比一年提高。葛佩琦为什么不看事实光瞎造谣言呢。我肯定的说，他一定是别有用心。
