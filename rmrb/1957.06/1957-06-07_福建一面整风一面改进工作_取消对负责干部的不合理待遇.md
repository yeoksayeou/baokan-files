Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 6th: Many ministers, bureau directors, and other responsible cadres of Fujian Province and Fuzhou Municipality's directly affiliated organizations, who used to travel to and from work by car, have mostly switched to bicycles, public transportation, or walking today. With the exception of official vehicles equipped according to State Council regulations, and vehicles dedicated to fire, ambulance, public security, postal, and telecommunications departments, the remaining seventy-plus cars and jeeps originally belonging to each unit have been taken out of use from today and will be uniformly allocated by the Provincial People's Committee to transportation service departments for commercial vehicles or mobile use. This is a new phenomenon in Fujian Province and Fuzhou Municipality's directly affiliated organizations after implementing rectification and immediate improvement in the rectification movement.

Since the start of the rectification movement, provincial and municipal directly affiliated units have also respectively canceled the originally established small canteens specifically for responsible cadres, the premier seating when booking movies or plays, and the unreasonably low rental fees for staff dormitory housing, and other unreasonable benefits.

    福建一面整风一面改进工作
    取消对负责干部的不合理待遇
    新华社福州6日电　福建省、福州市各直属机关中许多过去乘坐汽车上下办公的部长、厅、局长和其他负责干部，今天大多改乘自行车、公共汽车或步行上下班。各单位原有的汽车，除按国务院规定配备的公务车和消防、救护、公安、邮电等部门的专用车辆以外，其余的七十多辆小汽车、吉普车从今天起都停止使用，交由省人民委员会统一调配给交通服务部门作营业车辆或机动使用。这是福建省和福州市直属机关在整风运动中实行边整边改以后出现的新气象。
    自整风运动开始以来，省、市各直属机关单位还分别取消了原来设立的专门供应负责干部的小食堂和包场看电影、看戏时的首长席，以及机关工作人员宿舍房租收费过低等不合理的待遇。
