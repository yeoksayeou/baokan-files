Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 10th. Karpinko, academic secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Interplanetary Communications Committee, published an article in "Izvestia" on the 9th, stating that with current technological advancements, it is already possible to turn artificial Earth satellites into satellites of the Moon.

This article stated that it does not require engines with enormous horsepower to make an artificial satellite operating outside the atmosphere leave the Earth. As long as power sources with long-term effects, such as photocells or atomic generators, are used, the necessary power to make it leave the Earth can be created. Relying on all that current energy and charged particle accelerator technology possesses, it is not only possible to prevent the gradual descent of artificial satellites, but also to gradually bring them closer to the Moon over a period of, for example, one year. An Earth satellite, controlled by radio from the ground, can become a lunar satellite, conducting various surveys of the space around the Moon, and taking photographs of the other side of the Moon, invisible from Earth. All collected information, including photographs, can be transmitted back to Earth via radio.

The article also said that the launching of artificial satellites will help scientists depict the conditions of the upper atmosphere and collect materials from different altitudes between 300 and 1,000 kilometers above the ground. By studying the satellite's flight itself, or more precisely, by studying the orbital changes of the satellite due to air resistance (even though the air density here is so small that it is almost non-existent), scientists will obtain the necessary materials for air density. Artificial satellites will become the first laboratories that can study the living conditions of living organisms under weightless conditions for a long time. With artificial satellites, it is possible for the first time to conduct direct experimental verification of the so-called theory that time will be relatively shortened.

### 人造卫星能够围绕月球运动  用无线电详细报告各种情况

　　人造卫星能够围绕月球运动
　　用无线电详细报告各种情况
    新华社莫斯科10日电  苏联科学院星际交通委员会学术秘书卡尔平科9日在“消息报”发表文章说，由于目前的技术进展，已经有可能使人造地球卫星变成月亮的卫星。
    这篇文章说，使在大气层外运行的人造卫星离开地球，并不需要发动机具有巨大的马力。只要运用像光电池或原子发电机这样长期作用的电源，就可以造成使它离开地球所必要的动力。依靠目前能源和带电粒子加速器方面的技术所拥有的一切，不仅可以阻止人造卫星的逐渐下降，而且可以使它在例如一年的期间逐渐接近月球。在地面以无线电操纵的地球卫星，可以变成月球卫星，进行月球周围空间的各种调查，拍摄地球上看不见的月球另一半面的照片。所有收集到的情报，包括照片，都可以用无线电发到地球上。
    这篇文章还说，人造卫星的发射有助于科学家描绘大气高层情况的图，收集距地面三百到一千公里间不同高度的材料。研究卫星飞行本身，更准确地说，研究卫星由于空气阻力（虽然这里空气密度小到几乎等于没有）而产生的轨道变化，科学家们就会得到空气密度的必要材料。人造卫星将成为可以长期研究活机体在失重条件下生活状况的第一个实验室。有了人造卫星，就有可能第一次对所谓时间会相对缩减的理论进行直接实验性的检验。
