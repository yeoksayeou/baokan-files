　　Algerian Student Delegation Demands:
　　Stop the French Colonial War
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The head of the Algerian student delegation, Hemisti Mohammed, who is currently visiting China, expressed hope at a press conference held in Beijing tonight that various governments would put pressure on the French government to stop France's dirty war of aggression against Algeria.
    The head of the delegation told Chinese and foreign reporters that the Algerian people hoped to negotiate with France on the basis of recognizing Algeria's independence.
    He said that the French government is intensifying its suppression of the Algerian people in an attempt to extinguish the Algerian revolution. Concentration camps holding thousands of Algerians are constantly increasing, and death sentences are carried out daily even in the smallest towns. Algerians are subjected everywhere to torture and cruel punishments more brutal than those of the fascists.
    He said that there are currently 700,000 French invading troops in Algeria, and the French government is also mobilizing four batches of young people to go to Algeria for a comprehensive massacre. No matter how many French troops increase, the Algerian people will persevere in their struggle until final victory.
    Hemisti Mohammed said that the Algerian people's will for liberation is strengthening day by day, and the combat effectiveness of the National Liberation Army is also increasing day by day. These are all significant signs of the inevitable failure of the French invaders.
    Hemisti Mohammed also introduced the participation of Algerian students in the struggle. He said that Algerian students regard the right of their people to enjoy national sovereignty as their fundamental demand. They have carried out countless activities to promote the resolution of the painful Algerian dispute. The student union organizes students to demonstrate and call on students to join the ranks of the National Liberation Army. The students are determined to devote themselves entirely to the liberation struggle, and many students are willing to shed their blood for the victory of the struggle.

　　阿尔及利亚学生代表团要求
　　制止法国殖民战争
    据新华社12日讯　正在我国访问的阿尔及利亚学生代表团团长赫米斯提·穆罕默德今晚在北京举行的记者招待会上，希望各国政府对法国政府施加压力，制止法国侵略阿尔及利亚的肮脏战争。
    这位团长对中外记者说，阿尔及利亚人民希望在承认阿尔及利亚独立的基础上同法国进行谈判。
    他说，但是法国政府却加紧对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压企图熄灭阿尔及利亚革命。关着成千的阿尔及利亚人的集中营不断增多，甚至最小的城镇中每天也执行着死刑，到处对阿尔及利亚人施以比法西斯更残酷的拷打和毒刑。
    他说，目前有七十万法国侵略军在阿尔及利亚，法国政府还要动员四批青年到阿尔及利亚去进行全面屠杀。不管法军增加多少，阿尔及利亚人民都要坚持斗争到最后胜利。
    赫米斯提·穆罕默德说，阿尔及利亚人民要求解放的意志在一天天加强，民族解放军的战斗力也在一天天提高，这些都是法国侵略者必然失败的显著的迹象。
    赫米斯提·穆罕默德还介绍了阿尔及利亚学生参加斗争的情况。他说，阿尔及利亚学生把本国人民享受民族主权的权利作为他们根本的要求，他们进行了无数次的活动，以促使解决悲痛的阿尔及利亚争端，学生联合会组织学生进行示威，号召学生们参加民族解放军队伍。学生们决心全部投入解放斗争，为了争取斗争的胜利，很多学生不惜流出自己的鲜血。
