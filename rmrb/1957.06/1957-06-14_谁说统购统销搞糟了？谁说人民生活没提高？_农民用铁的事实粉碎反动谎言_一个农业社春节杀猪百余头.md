　　Nanjing, June 13 (report from our newspaper) Is it only Party cadres riding in cars whose living standards have improved since liberation? The peasants of Jiangdong First Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanjing refuted this fallacy of Ge Peiqi with their own experiences. Cooperative member Li Xinhua said: Everyone remembers that in the past, the land belonged to the landlords. Farmers were full when grasping rice stalks but hungry when letting them go, selling cheap and buying dear, suffering countless hardships and indignities. After liberation, the land came into our own hands. When I worked individually in 1953, my income was 700 yuan, the highest in the whole township. In 1954, when we set up a small cooperative, my income was 800 yuan. Last year, when we set up a large cooperative, my income was 1008 yuan. This is true for every one of the 550 households in our cooperative. How can you say that farmers' lives have not improved? Middle peasant Li Hongliang said: Our lives as middle peasants are also better than before. In the past, my family had to borrow money at the end of the year. Last year, we ate until winter and received six months of grain rations, plus over 400 yuan in cash. This year, during the lean season, our cooperative members still had more than 7,000 yuan in savings in the credit cooperative. How can you say that only a few people have improved their lives? In the past, we farmers didn't have the opportunity to go to school. After liberation, the farmers turned over, and my eldest son has already entered the Nanjing Institute of Technology. Female cooperative member Li Xiuzhen said with great excitement: I, Li Xiuzhen, was over forty years old when I finally stopped being in debt in 1954 after joining the cooperative. Last year, my family with four laborers earned 1,700 yuan, and the whole family added new clothes and new quilts. We have never lived such a good life. In my opinion, Ge Peiqi's saying such things reflects that the desire of some people to exploit us has not died. Cooperative member Yu Debing talked about the pork supply issue: Ge Peiqi said that the pork was all eaten by the cadres, and the farmers were unwilling to raise pigs. This is simply nonsense. We didn't raise pigs here in the past, but now we raise more than a thousand. During the Spring Festival, not counting the meat that 550 cooperative member households bought in the streets, they slaughtered 120 pigs in their own homes. Li Xiuzhen said: Our Eleventh Team, with 18 families, slaughtered 17 pigs for the New Year, and my family still has ham now.

　　Many cooperative members, in their speeches, particularly refuted the claim that unified purchase and supply had messed things up. Middle peasant Yu Chaogui believed that this was also a tactic to provoke the relationship between the Party and the peasants. He said: In the past, when buying rationed rice, the price of rice went up every day. A load of cucumbers was not enough to buy two liters of rice. During the lean season, farmers borrowed one shi of rice from hoarding speculators and had to pay back two shi. Does a teacher at Renmin University not know these situations? Labor model Li Chuanzhong said: Of course, unified purchase and supply is not good for illegal capitalists because they can no longer hoard and exploit people. Now, rice is sold to the state for 7.2 yuan per dan, and rice seeds are also bought for 7.2 yuan per dan. The grain supplied by the state is only a little tight for households with large populations. My family even has 20 jin extra each month to adjust to others. We farmers think that unified purchase and supply is very good. I am a middle peasant, and the Party has turned the backward countryside into a new socialist countryside. The yield per unit area of rice has increased from 180 jin in the early days of liberation to 550 jin. Did the Party do something wrong? The multiple cropping of vegetables has changed from two crops a year to four or five crops a year. Did the Party do something wrong? If the Communist Party were to break away from the masses of the people, it would never be able to achieve this. How can you say that the relationship between the Party and the masses is tens of thousands of miles away compared to before liberation?

　　谁说统购统销搞糟了？谁说人民生活没提高？
　　农民用铁的事实粉碎反动谎言
　　一个农业社春节杀猪百余头
    本报南京13日电　解放后生活水平提高的只有坐小汽车的党员干部吗？南京市郊区江东一社的农民们以亲身的经历驳斥了葛佩琦这个谬论。社员李新华说：大家都记得，过去田是地主的，农民抓着稻把子肚子饱，丢了稻把子肚子饥，卖贱买贵，吃的苦受的气不知其数。解放后，土地到了自己手上，1953年我单干时，收入七百元，全乡数我最高。1954年办小社，收入八百元。去年办了大社，收入了一千零八元。我们社里五百五十户，家家是这样，怎么说农民生活没有改善呢？中农李宏亮说：我们中农生活也比过去好，我家过去年底也要背债，去年吃用到冬天，分了半年口粮，还分了四百多块钱现金。今年青黄不接时，我们社员在信用社里还存了七千多块钱，怎么说改善生活的是少数人呢？过去我们农民都没有机会上学，解放后农民翻了身，我的大儿子已经进了南京工学院。女社员李秀珍十分激动地说：我李秀珍过了四十多岁，到1954年办社才不背债。去年我家四个劳动力，收入一千七百元，全家添新衣、新被，从来没有过到这样的好日子。我看葛佩琦说这种话，是反映了有些人想剥削我们的心还没有死。社员余得炳谈到猪肉供应问题时说：葛佩琦说猪肉都被干部吃掉了，农民不高兴养猪，这简直是胡说。我们这里过去不养猪，现在养一千多头。过春节的时候，五百五十户社员到街上买的肉不算，单自己家里杀的猪就有一百二十头。李秀珍说：我们十一队十八家过年杀了十七头猪，我家现在还有火腿。
    许多社员在发言中，特别驳斥了统购统销搞糟了的说法。中农余朝贵认为这也是挑拨党和农民关系的手法。他说：过去买配给米，米价天天涨，一担黄瓜不够买二升米。青黄不接时，农民向囤粮的投机商人借一石稻加利一石。这些情况难道一个人民大学的教师都不知道吗？劳动模范李传中说：对不法资本家来说，统购统销当然不好了，因为他们不好囤积了，不好剥削人了。现在稻子卖给国家七块二一担，买稻种还是七块二一担。国家供应的粮食，只有少数人口多的户紧一点，像我家每月还多二十斤调剂给别人。我们农民认为统购统销好得很。我是一个中农，党把落后的农村，变成了社会主义的新农村，水稻单位面积产量由解放初期的一百八十斤，增加到五百五十斤，这是党做错了吗？蔬菜复种由一年两熟改为一年四、五熟，是党做错了吗？如果共产党脱离人民群众，决不会做到这一步。怎么能说党和群众的关系和解放前相比，相差了十万八千里呢？
