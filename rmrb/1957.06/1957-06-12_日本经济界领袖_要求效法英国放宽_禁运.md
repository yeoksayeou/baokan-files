　　Japanese Economic Leaders
　　Demand Relaxation of "Embargo" Like Britain
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: Thirty-one leaders of Japanese economic circles believe that it would be beneficial for Japan to adopt the same attitude as Britain on trade with China. They have requested that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi persuade the United States to relax trade restrictions on China during his visit to the United States.
    These responsible individuals from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, led by Taizo Ishizaka, expressed this opinion yesterday at a symposium convened by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida.
    The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations also believes that Japan's political stance should be taken into consideration when requesting the relaxation of the "embargo." These economic figures particularly hope that Nobusuke Kishi will firmly hold a complete view of the future development of the Japanese economy during his visit to the United States.
    The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade has already issued an appeal to the business community, requesting the launch of a campaign to urge the Japanese government to take measures to abolish the China Committee of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM) in Paris. In a resolution to Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Minister of International Trade and Industry Mikio Mizuta, the Osaka Prefectural Assembly stated that the Japanese government must weigh the current international situation and follow the example of the British government in lifting trade barriers with China.
    Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma of the Japan Socialist Party stated in Fukuoka today that he demands that the Japanese government sign the fourth Japan-China trade agreement before Nobusuke Kishi visits the United States. The third Japan-China trade agreement expired in early May of this year.

　　日本经济界领袖
　　要求效法英国放宽“禁运”
    据新华社11日讯  东京消息：三十一位日本经济界领袖认为，在对华贸易上日本采取和英国相同的态度是有利的。他们要求日本首相岸信介在访问美国的时候使美国同意放宽对中国的贸易限制。
    以石坂泰三为首的日本经济团体联合会的这些负责人士，昨天在参加内阁官房长官石田博英召开的座谈会上发表了这种意见。
    经济团体联合会同时认为，在要求放宽“禁运”时，也要把日本的政治立场考虑在内。这些经济界人士特别希望岸信介去访问美国时，对日本经济的发展前途坚决地抱着完整的见解。
    日本国际贸易促进协会已经向工商界发出呼吁，要求展开一个促使日本政府采取措施取消巴黎统筹委员会的中国委员会的运动。大阪府议会在一项给首相岸信介和通商产业相水田三喜男的决议中说，日本政府必须权衡现今的国际局势，效法英国政府取消对华贸易壁垒。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天在福冈发表谈话，要求日本政府在岸信介访美以前签订第四次日中贸易协定。第三次中日贸易协定早已在今年5月初期满。
