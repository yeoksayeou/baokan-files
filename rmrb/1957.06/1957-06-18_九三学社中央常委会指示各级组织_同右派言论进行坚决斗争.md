Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society today issued instructions to its affiliated organizations at all levels, calling on members to resolutely struggle against anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies, and to continue to conduct "unity-criticism-unity" style of airing views, helping the Communist Party in its rectification campaign.

The instructions stated that during this stage of assisting the Communist Party in its rectification campaign, a small number of rightists have spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. A fierce political and ideological struggle of supporting socialism and opposing socialism has now unfolded.

The instructions stated: In this struggle, it is undeniable that some members and the masses they are connected with, due to ideological ambiguity and a lack of firm positions, have been more or less confused by the fallacies of a small number of rightists, and some have even shown sympathy to varying degrees out of petty-bourgeois sentimentality, which is wrong. The foundation of the unity of the people throughout the country is socialism, and the criterion for distinguishing right from wrong is socialism. All words and deeds that deviate from socialism are wrong and harmful. The counterattack against the anti-socialist actions of rightists should not be regarded as the suppression of criticism from the people; there is an essential difference between the two.

The instructions pointed out that some people believe that launching a criticism of fallacies during such a period of great airing of views is a sign of retraction. This view is incorrect. In the process of "airing" and "letting go," there should be criticism as well as counter-criticism, which is originally appropriate. Resolutely refuting fallacies is precisely to prevent well-intentioned criticism from being confused and to open up a correct path for great airing of views.

　　九三学社中央常委会指示各级组织
    同右派言论进行坚决斗争
    据新华社17日讯　九三学社中央常务委员会今天向所属各级组织发布指示，号召社员同反党、反社会主义的谬论进行坚决斗争，并且继续本着“团结——批评——团结”的方针进行鸣放，帮助共产党整风。
    指示说，在帮助共产党整风的这一阶段中，有少数右派分子散布反党、反社会主义的谬论。目前已经展开了一场拥护社会主义和反对社会主义的激烈的政治思想斗争。
    指示说：在这场斗争中，无可讳言，有些社员及其所联系的群众，由于思想认识模糊，立场不够坚定，或多或少地为少数右派分子的谬论所迷惑，甚至有的从小资产阶级的温情主义出发，反而程度不同地有所同情，这是错误的。全国人民团结的基础是社会主义，明辨是非的标准是社会主义。一切离开社会主义的言论和行动都是错误的、有害的。不能把对右派分子反社会主义行动的反击，认为是对人民群众批评的压制，两者是有本质的区别的。
    指示指出，有些人认为在这样大放大鸣期间，来展开对谬论的批判是否要收？这种看法是不正确的。在“鸣”“放”过程中，有批评，也要有反批评，这本来是应当的。对谬论的坚决驳斥，正是为了使善意的批评不被混淆，是为大放大鸣开辟了正确的道路。
