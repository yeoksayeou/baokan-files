Starting from "Is There a Need for the Young Pioneers?"
    Chen Wenshu

    It is already International Children's Day, "June 1st," and suddenly raising the question of whether the Young Pioneers have any need to exist, even if not shocking, is at least inappropriate. However, there is a reason for this, and a newspaper to prove it:

    "The Young Pioneers were copied from the Soviet Union, and I doubt whether such an organization needs to exist. Because it is good for children who can join, but for those who cannot, it stimulates and pressures their young minds, creating feelings of inferiority, which greatly affects their growth." (May 27th, "Tianjin Daily," speech by female teacher Huang Xinping of the Third Girls' Middle School)

    "Copied from the Soviet Union," why does this become the premise for some people to "doubt" everything? In my opinion, this statement is untenable. The issue is not about being "copied from the Soviet Union," but about whether it suits China's conditions, and how to learn from the Soviet experience based on our actual situation and needs. Speaking of the Young Pioneers, anyone who examines the facts even slightly will discover: First, we have a tradition of revolutionary children's organizations that started with the Wuhan Labor Children's Corps thirty years ago. For thirty years, young children have received profound revolutionary education and grown up healthily under the leadership of their own organizations. Second, eight years of practice have proven that it has become an educational organization that unites and educates the vast number of young children, just as Lenin said, it "is a good way to educate communists."

    Those who oppose the existence of the Young Pioneers also have concrete reasons, which is that if they cannot join, it will affect the children's growth.

    These comrades probably haven't seen that the Young Pioneers have already become a broad organization for young children. All children who are of the appropriate age and willing to join can wear the red scarf. Of course, in actual work, are there cases of not admitting children to the team according to the charter, or arbitrarily raising the admission conditions? Yes. But these are just shortcomings and deviations in the work, which should be corrected. Are there people who ridicule and mock those age-appropriate children who have not yet worn the red scarf? Not only in schools, but also in families and society. This is because a small number of people do not yet understand the organization of the Young Pioneers and still hold incorrect attitudes.

    In fact, the most important thing is to ask the children: "Do you need the Young Pioneers or not?" I think, whether they are members or non-members, their answer will be affirmative: Yes! If you ask another question: "Some people advocate abolishing the Young Pioneers, what do you think?" – I don't know how they will answer.

    In my opinion, this kind of opinion, like those who advocate that public representatives withdraw from joint ventures, etc., belongs to the opinions of those who abandon food because of choking. We firmly disagree with abandoning food because of choking. Choking should be avoided, but food must not be thrown away under any circumstances.

    从“少先队有没有存在的必要”谈起
    陈文澍
    时当“六一”国际儿童节，忽然提出少先队有没有存在的必要，即使不是令人大吃一惊，至少也是不合时宜。但是，事出有因，有报为证：
    “少先队是从苏联搬来的，我怀疑这样的组织有没有存在的必要。因为孩子们能入队，固然好；但是不能入队，就使得孩子们的小心灵上受到刺激，受到压力，造成自卑感，很影响他们的成长”。（5月27日“天津日报”，女三中教师黄心平的发言）
    “从苏联搬来的”，为什么就成为有些人“怀疑”一切的前提？我看，这种说法是站不住脚的。问题不在于从“苏联搬来”，而是在于是否适合中国的情况，在于如何根据我们的实际情况和需要来学习苏联经验。说到少先队，谁只要稍为考察一下事实，就会发现：一，我们有从三十年前武汉劳动童子团就开始的革命儿童组织的传统，三十年来，少年儿童在自己的组织的领导下，获得深刻的革命教育，健壮地成长起来；二，建队八年来的实践，证明它已经成为团结教育广大少年儿童的教育组织，正如列宁说过的，它“是教育共产主义者的好办法”。
    反对少先队存在的人还有具体理由，就是如果不能入队，就要影响孩子们的成长。
    这些同志大约没有看到，少先队已经成为少年儿童的广泛性组织，凡是适合队龄，愿意入队的孩子，都能带上红领巾。自然，在实际工作里，有没有不按照队章吸收儿童入队、或者随便提高入队条件的呢？有的。但这只是工作中的缺点、偏差，应该改正。有没有讥笑、嘲讽那些还没有戴红领巾的适龄儿童呢？不仅是学校里有，家庭里、社会上也是有的。这是由于少数人对少先队的组织还不了解，还抱有不正确的态度。
    其实，最重要的，还是不妨去问一问孩子们：“少先队究竟要不要？”我想，不管队员还是非队员，他们的回答，都会是肯定的：要！如果再问一句：“有人主张取消少先队，你们看怎样？”——我不知道他们会怎么回答。
    我看，这种意见，也同那些主张公方代表撤出合营企业等等意见一样，是属于因噎废食论者的意见。而因噎废食，我们是坚决不赞同的。噎，要避免；食，却是无论如何也不能丢掉的。
