Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th: The first phase of the West Lake dredging project in Hangzhou has been completed. More than four million cubic meters of silt have been excavated from the bottom of the lake, which, if piled up, could build more than twenty Su Causeways. Now the water in West Lake is deeper, and it appears even more rippling and碧波.

The second phase of the dredging project is proceeding day and night and is expected to be completed by the end of this year, two years ahead of the original plan to be completed in 1959.

From the Ming and Qing dynasties to the Kuomintang rule, West Lake had not undergone a comprehensive dredging for four or five hundred years. Especially during the Kuomintang rule, the trees on the four mountains surrounding the lake were cut down, and a large amount of sediment was washed into the lake every year, gradually raising the lake bed. Before liberation, the average depth of the lake water was only more than sixty centimeters.

After liberation, the People's Government paid attention to the dredging of West Lake. After the West Lake is dredged, it will first beautify the West Lake, so that black mud will no longer rise after the boats pass, and the rippling碧波 will increase the elegance of boating. At the same time, it also has the effect of regulating the climate. Because West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides, in summer, the scorching sun and hot wind are not easy to dissipate; and because the lake water is too shallow, the heat absorption capacity is too small, making the city too hot. After the West Lake is dredged deeper, the temperature in the city can be regulated and lowered. The city's rivers can also be used to flush with lake water to improve environmental sanitation. In addition, it is also beneficial to farmland irrigation and tap water sources.

The large-scale dredging project of West Lake started in April 1954. The first phase of the dredging project plans to deepen the West Lake by an average of one meter; the second phase of the dredging project plans to further deepen the outer West Lake by fifty centimeters. After the completion of the entire lake dredging project by the end of the year, the water storage capacity can be increased by more than double.

### 碧波漾然  西湖更加美丽  第一期疏浚工程完成

　　碧波漾然  西湖更加美丽
    第一期疏浚工程完成
    据新华社杭州20日电  杭州西湖的第一期疏浚计划已经完成。从湖底挖出淤泥四百多万立方公尺，如果把这些淤泥堆积起来，可筑成二十多条苏堤。现在西湖湖水深了，更显得碧波漾然。
    第二期疏浚工程正在夜以继日地进行，预计今年年底可以完成全部疏浚工程，比原定1959年才能完成的计划提前两年实现。
    西湖从明、清到国民党统治时代，四五百年间，一直没有经过全面的疏浚。尤其在国民党统治时期，环湖四山树木遭受砍伐，每年都有大量泥沙冲入湖中，使湖床逐渐加高，解放前湖水深度平均只有六十多公分。
    解放后，人民政府就注意到西湖的疏浚。西湖疏浚后，首先能美化西湖，使游船经过后不再泛起黑泥，碧波漾漾，益增弄舟雅兴。同时还有调节气候的作用。因西湖三面靠山，每到夏季，烈日猛晒，热风不易散发；又因湖水过浅，吸热能力过小，使市区过于闷热。西湖浚深以后，市区气温就可得到调节降低。市区河道也可利用湖水冲洗，改善环境卫生。另外，对农田灌溉和自来水源也有好处。
    西湖的大规模疏浚工程开始于1954年4月。第一期疏浚工程计划把西湖平均挖深一公尺；第二期疏浚工程计划在外西湖再挖深五十公分。到年底全湖疏浚工程完成后，蓄水量可以增加一倍多。
