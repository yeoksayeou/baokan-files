　　Low-Temperature Nuclear Fusion Reactions May Release Large Amounts of Energy
　　Soviet Scientists Hope Scientists Will Further Study This Important Issue
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: The Soviet magazine "Young Technician" has recently published a series of news items and articles, continuously introducing a new achievement in the theory of nuclear physics – using catalysts to promote nuclear reactions at low temperatures without high temperatures. It is said that the energy released by this reaction is twice as much as the energy released by the same unit weight of uranium during fission.
    This new method was proposed by prominent Soviet scientists Zeldovich, Sakharov, and Markov in 1954. Not long ago, Alvarez et al. at the University of California in the United States confirmed its feasibility through experiments.
    In the past, nuclear fusion reactions could only be carried out under ultra-high temperatures of several million degrees. Such high temperatures can only be achieved during an atomic bomb explosion. Therefore, it is difficult to control this reaction to make it occur regularly, and it is difficult to use the energy released by this reaction to serve mankind. Therefore, scientists have sought ways to achieve nuclear reactions without atomic bomb explosions. The discovery of low-temperature nuclear fusion reactions eliminates the need for the ultra-high temperatures required for thermonuclear reactions, and also eliminates the need to use rare raw materials – uranium. This discovery is the beginning of research into new nuclear reactions.
  The basic characteristic of this method is to use negative μ-mesons as catalysts to combine hydrogen nuclei with deuterium nuclei to form helium nuclei, thereby releasing a large amount of energy. The main process of this reaction is that a μ-meson, which is two hundred and ten times heavier than an electron and also carries a negative charge, squeezes out the electron in a hydrogen atom after falling into it, and begins to rotate around the hydrogen nucleus itself. This forms a "mesonic atom." The entire mesonic atom is like an uncharged particle similar to a neutron. After the mesonic atom encounters a deuterium nucleus, the meson immediately begins to rotate around both the hydrogen nucleus and the deuterium nucleus, becoming a so-called "mesonic molecule." Because the distance between the two nuclei within this "molecule" is extremely small, the two nuclei immediately fuse into a helium nucleus like a thermonuclear reaction. At the same time, 5.4 million electron volts of energy and a μ-meson are released. The μ-meson can then continue to cause the aforementioned reaction process. In this reaction, the μ-meson does not participate in the reaction but only acts as a catalyst. This reaction is carried out in liquid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures.
    The magazine pointed out that since it takes about 300 million electron volts of energy to obtain one μ-meson, and one such reaction only releases 5.4 million electron volts of energy, and moreover, the lifespan of the μ-meson is too short (two millionths of a second), it can only cause one or two pairs of hydrogen and deuterium nuclei to react. Therefore, this reaction is not of practical significance for the time being. The article says that whether it is possible to use catalytic reactions to obtain large amounts of energy remains to be further studied by scientists.

　　苏联科学家希望科学家进一步研究这个重要问题
    新华社莫斯科12日电  苏联“少年技术家”杂志最近几期发表了一系列的消息和文章，连续介绍原子核物理学理论上的一个新成就——不用高温而在低温条件下利用催化剂促成核反应。据说，这种反应释放出来的能量比同样单位重量的铀在裂变时释放出来的能量要多一倍。
    这种新方法是苏联著名科学家泽尔多维奇、萨哈罗夫和马尔科夫1954年提出的，不久以前，美国加利福尼亚大学阿尔瓦雷斯等经过实验已经证实了它的可能性。
    原子核合成反应过去只能在几百万度的超高温条件下进行。这样高的温度，只有在原子弹爆炸时才能获得。因而这种反应很难加以控制使之经常进行，很难利用这种反应释放出来的能来为人类服务，于是科学家就设法找寻不通过原子弹爆炸来实现核反应的办法。低温核合成反应的发现，就可以不需要热核反应所必需的超高温，同时也就不需要使用稀有原料——铀。这一发现是研究新型核反应的开端。
  这种方法的基本特点是，利用负μ介子作催化剂，使氢核同氘核结合为氦核，从而释放出大量的能。这种反应的主要过程是，比电子重二百一十倍并且也带阴电μ介子，在落入氢原子以后，即挤出其中的电子，而本身开始围绕氢核旋转。这样就形成了“介子原子”。整个介子原子就像一个与中子类似的不带电粒子。介子原子碰见氘核以后，介子立即开始同时围绕氢核和氘核旋转，成了所谓“介子分子”。由于这种“分子”内两个核距离极小，两个核马上就像热核反应那样合成了氦核。同时释放出五百四十万电子伏特的能和μ介子。μ介子于是可以继续引起前述反应过程。在这种反应中，μ介子并不参加到反应中来，而只起催化作用。这种反应是在温度极低的液态氢中进行的。
    这家杂志指出，由于得到一个μ介子需要耗费约三亿电子伏特能量，而一次这种反应只能释放出五百四十万电子伏特能量，此外，μ介子寿命太短促（百万分之二秒），只能引起一两对氢核和氘核进行反应，因此这种反应暂时还没有实际意义。文章说，是否可能利用催化反应获得大量的能，尚待科学家进一步研究。
