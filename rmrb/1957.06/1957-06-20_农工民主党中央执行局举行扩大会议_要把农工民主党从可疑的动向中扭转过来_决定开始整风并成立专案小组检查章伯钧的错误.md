    (Reported by our newspaper) The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party held its enlarged 29th meeting yesterday, discussing and adopting in principle the "Instruction on Upholding Socialism! Fighting to the End Against Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Rightists!" issued by the Executive Bureau to local Peasants and Workers Democratic Party organizations; resolved to convene an enlarged Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee; discussed and adopted the "Statement on the Political Orientation of Guangming Daily Once Being Tampered With"; decided to conduct a party-wide rectification campaign and temporarily suspend the development of the organization during the rectification period; and also discussed the question of "how to help Zhang Bojun recognize his mistakes, make a profound self-criticism, and honestly confess."

    Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He said: Zhang Bojun's problem is both an ideological problem and a political problem, and it is very serious. Therefore, all parties are required to continue to expose him and Zhang Bojun is required to conduct a profound self-examination. We should also treat this issue with a very serious attitude. Zhang Bojun was a political speculator and profiteer in the past. After liberation, he became arrogant and complacent, thinking he had made contributions, and bourgeois ideas gradually emerged. Finally, he even developed into a sinister and ambitious careerist with ulterior motives, trying to create his own system. This is a disgrace to our party and is deeply painful. Over the years, he has appeared as a revolutionary, deceiving our party comrades and also deceiving the Communist Party. In fact, he has been planning to collude with rightists to create personal power, threaten the Communist Party, and usurp leadership. Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks and activities have caused incalculable losses to the country and serious losses to our party. The Central Executive Bureau must take all necessary measures to make up for these losses. Therefore, this meeting is convened.

    Wang Yifan read out successively at the meeting the telegrams from the Guangdong Provincial Committee, Guangzhou Municipal Committee, Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Nanjing Municipal Committee, and Jiangxi Provincial Committee and Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party to the Central Executive Bureau; Yang Yitang read out the six resolutions of the Traffic Department General Branch of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. These telegrams and resolutions all expressed that they would strictly draw a line ideologically with Zhang Bojun, resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party; unanimously demanded that Zhang Bojun make a profound self-examination and make an explanation to the whole party and the people of the whole country; and agreed with the spirit of the urgent telegram issued by the Executive Bureau on the 17th, mobilizing grassroots organizations and all party comrades to fight against anti-communist and anti-socialist thoughts and speeches. In order to facilitate Zhang Bojun's ideological self-examination, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee also suggested immediately suspending Zhang Bojun from all positions in the party.

    Huang Qixiang explained at the meeting: As the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee, I felt very uneasy seeing the seriousness of Zhang Bojun's problem. On the morning of the 17th, I came to the party headquarters and, after discussing with some responsible comrades, believed that it was necessary to seize the time and take urgent measures to call on all party comrades to thoroughly criticize Zhang Bojun and completely draw a line with Zhang Bojun politically and ideologically. It was immediately decided to issue a notice (urgent telegram) to local organizations in the name of the Central Executive Bureau, and it has already been published in the newspaper on the 18th. He said: I hope this matter was not done wrong, and I request the Executive Bureau to ratify it. ——At the meeting, everyone applauded and passed the ratification of this notice.

    Executive Bureau member Yan Xinmin read out the draft instruction "Uphold Socialism! Fight to the End Against Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Rightists!" at the meeting and made an explanation. He said: What is the trend of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in the last period? What is the development direction and what is the propaganda direction? Is it the socialist direction or the non-socialist direction? It is doubtful and needs to be carefully examined. All comrades of our party should deeply reflect and clear the poison of Zhang Bojun's thought from their minds, examine and criticize the influence of Zhang Bojun's political conspiracy from all party affairs activities, turn the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party from a questionable trend, and resolutely move forward on the socialist road. For this purpose, the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party decided to issue instructions to the whole party. I hope everyone will offer their opinions.

    When discussing this draft instruction, Li Boqiu, He Shikun, Wang Jiyi, Wang Renxuan, Zhang Yunchuan, Yang Yitang, Yang Qingyuan, Wang Yifan, Li Shihao, Xu Biru, and others spoke. The vast majority of people believed in their speeches that this instruction should further emphasize the necessity of further exposing Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks and political conspiracy, and call on comrades in the central and local areas to expose a large number of specific facts in this regard; some people also exposed Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks and behaviors that were not conducive to unity at the meeting. Wang Yifan also pointed out: Zhang Bojun's conspiracy has been initially crushed by the vast number of workers, peasants, progressive intellectuals, and all conscious people. Now it is necessary to strictly prevent Zhang Bojun's other trick - slipping away like a cicada shedding its skin; it is necessary to completely eliminate his influence in the whole party and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the "third line" with a long history. Zhang Yunchuan believes that the Central Executive Bureau should not fail to state in this instruction that it should bear a certain responsibility for Zhang Bojun's mistakes. He said: Zhang Bojun had already expressed these wrong remarks in the party, but our political level was low and we failed to distinguish them; not only did we not fight against them, but some people also felt that these remarks were very good! Comrades in the party who have more contact with Zhang Bojun probably heard more "private words" than Zhang Bojun told Shi Liang, and they have a responsibility to expose these words. At the meeting, some people also suggested collecting Zhang Bojun's past erroneous remarks made in public, semi-public, and personal contacts, printing them, and distributing them to members in the party for discussion. Li Boqiu and others proposed that this instruction should propose to immediately carry out rectification in the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and temporarily suspend the development of the organization. Some people believed that it was necessary to carry out rectification, but it was not necessary to write it into this document, and instructions could be issued separately. Finally, everyone believed that rectification and temporary suspension of the development of the organization were very important. On the one hand, instructions should be issued separately, and on the other hand, it should also be written in this instruction.

    The meeting adopted this instruction in principle and decided to rewrite it after absorbing everyone's opinions and issue it as a formal document the next day.

    The meeting passed a motion on convening the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee (Enlarged). The purpose of convening this plenary session is mainly to discuss Zhang Bojun's serious mistakes, and the rectification and development of the organization of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. The specific date and scope of the expansion of the meeting will be determined separately.

    Then, after discussion, the enlarged meeting of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party passed a statement on the political orientation of Guangming Daily once being tampered with.

    Then, the meeting passed a resolution on launching a rectification movement in the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and temporarily suspending the development of the organization during the rectification movement. The resolution said: In order to support the Communist Party of China, support the cause of socialism, support the people's democratic dictatorship, resolutely draw a line with rightist thoughts, expose and criticize the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun, etc., the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party is in fact carrying out party rectification. In order to clarify the current primary work, it is decided to conduct a party-wide rectification, starting from the central government and gradually promoting it. The guidelines, steps, and specific content of the rectification will be formulated by the Central Executive Bureau and will be announced separately. During the rectification period, the development of organizations will be temporarily suspended throughout the country.

    The meeting finally discussed the question of "how to help Zhang Bojun recognize his mistakes, make a profound self-criticism, and honestly confess." Yang Ziheng proposed that several groups could be organized to talk to Zhang Bojun one by one, and help him in the way of rectification proposed by the CCP, in a gentle and friendly manner. Many people disagreed with Yang Ziheng's opinion. Yang Qingyuan said: To determine what method to take, we must first have a consistent understanding of the nature of Zhang Bojun's mistakes. He believes that Zhang Bojun's wrong path has reached the edge of transforming from contradictions among the people into contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and the problem cannot be solved by general group assistance and gentle and friendly methods. Li Shihao said: Zhang Bojun's problem is already a political problem, and the struggle with him is a class struggle. This struggle was provoked by their rightists. They first adopted the "great democracy" method of class struggle; therefore, the struggle against him should also have great mass pressure, and first of all, he should be exposed as much as possible among the masses, and he should honestly confess and examine himself. I don't think it will work to rely solely on the strength of a few people in the central government. Li Boqiu said: Zhang Bojun is a major general in the bourgeoisie's attack on socialism. The main method for him should not be heart-to-heart talks, he will not listen to you. The best way at present is to expose his absurd remarks and tear off his mask in front of the masses. He must be made to feel that he has been isolated and no longer fantasize that someone will rescue him; otherwise, he will not turn to the people. Luo Renyi, Wang Shanji, He Shikun, Xia Kangnong, Wang Yifan, and others also agreed with Yang Qingyuan's opinions, believing that gentle and friendly methods should not be adopted for those who take the anti-socialist road. As for what kind of contradiction the struggle against the rightists is, don't rush to draw conclusions now; the main task at present is to expose specific materials as much as possible.

    Zhang Bojun did not attend the meeting yesterday morning and afternoon. Before the meeting, he called to ask for leave, saying that he went to bed very late the day before, and he needed to rest today. As long as he felt better, he would definitely come to the meeting. Shortly before the end of the meeting, Huang Qixiang received such a letter from Zhang Bojun: "Today's enlarged meeting of the Executive Bureau, I could not attend this morning due to an appointment, and this afternoon due to poor health. I am very sorry, please forgive me. I am very grateful for the criticisms made by all comrades. I hope to establish a group to help me conduct an examination. If this proposal is approved, please let me know. I am extremely grateful."

    Huang Qixiang announced this letter to the meeting, which aroused great dissatisfaction among everyone. Some people pointed out that Zhang Bojun said on the surface that he hoped that everyone would help him check, but he used various excuses to not meet everyone, which was dishonest. Some people also pointed out that Zhang Bojun's suggestion of "establishing a group" is itself a trap. According to his opinion, "helping" him can only put the Central Committee of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in a state of powerlessness. Therefore, the meeting unanimously resolved that the Central Executive Bureau of the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party should immediately establish an inspection team directly responsible to the Executive Bureau to investigate Zhang Bojun's mistakes to relevant people and relevant parties; at the same time, Zhang Bojun was ordered to make a detailed explanation of his erroneous words and deeds to this team. The meeting also decided to tell Zhang Bojun this resolution in the name of the Central Executive Bureau as a reply to his letter. Many people especially pointed out that this group is not a "help group" responsible for Zhang Bojun, nor can it go to his home to discuss issues; instead, it is an "inspection group" responsible for the Executive Bureau collectively, and Zhang Bojun should be asked to come to the party headquarters to talk; when an enlarged meeting is needed, the inspection group should also recommend that the Executive Bureau convene it.

    Huang Shenzhi also proposed at the meeting: Don't forget Li Jiansheng. She only came to one of the several meetings, and then left again. She has been with Zhang Bojun for many years and knows everything, but avoids this serious political struggle, which is wrong.

    At this meeting, Zhou Taixuan and Wu Yugan also made written statements.

### 农工民主党中央执行局举行扩大会议  要把农工民主党从可疑的动向中扭转过来  决定开始整风并成立专案小组检查章伯钧的错误

　　农工民主党中央执行局举行扩大会议
　　要把农工民主党从可疑的动向中扭转过来
　　决定开始整风并成立专案小组检查章伯钧的错误
    本报讯　中国农工民主党中央执行局昨天举行了扩大的第二十九次会议，讨论并在原则上通过了执行局向各地农工民主党党组织发出的题为“坚持社会主义！与反党反社会主义的右派分子斗争到底！”的指示；决议召开扩大的三届四中全会；讨论并通过了“为光明日报一度被篡改政治方向的声明”；决定全党进行整风而且在整风期间暂行停止发展组织；还讨论了“怎样帮助章伯钧认识错误、深刻检讨、认真交代”的问题。
    会议由农工民主党副主席黄琪翔致开幕词。他说：章伯钧问题，是思想问题，又是政治问题，十分严重。因此，要求各方面继续揭发并要章伯钧进行深刻检查。我们也应该以十分严肃的态度来对待这一问题。章伯钧过去是一个投机取巧、唯利是图的政客。解放以后，自恃有功，骄傲自大，资产阶级思想逐渐冒头。最后，竟发展成为居心叵测的恶毒的野心家，妄图自搞一套，这是我党的耻辱，令人切齿痛心。历年来，他以革命的面目出现，欺骗我党同志，也欺骗共产党；实际上他在有计划地勾结右派分子，造成个人势力，威胁共产党，篡夺领导权。章伯钧的反动言论和活动，给国家带来的损失是难以估计的，给予我党的损失也是严重的。中央执行局必须采取各项必要的措施来弥补这些损失。因此，召开这次会议。
    王一帆在会上先后宣读了农工民主党广东省委会、广州市委会、江苏省委会和南京市委会、江西省委会和南昌市委会给中央执行局的电报；杨逸棠宣读了农工民主党交通部总支部的六条决议。这些电报和决议中，都表示要严格地同章伯钧划清思想界限，坚决在共产党领导下走社会主义道路；一致要求章伯钧深刻检查，向全党和全国人民作出交代；同意执行局17日发出的急电的精神，发动基层组织全党同志同反共反社会主义的思想言论作斗争。为了便于章伯钧进行思想检查，广州市委会还建议立即停止章伯钧在党内的一切职务。
    黄琪翔在会上说明：我作为中央委员会副主席，看到章伯钧问题的严重性，十分不安。17日早晨，到党部来，和部分负责同志商议后，认为必须把握时间，采取紧急措施，号召全党同志彻底批判章伯钧，并在政治立场上和思想上和章伯钧彻底划清界限。当即决定以中央执行局名义向各地组织发出通知（急电），并且已经在18日的报纸上发表了。他说：希望这件事没有做错，并请求执行局予以追认。——会上，大家鼓掌通过了追认这个通知。
    执行局委员严信民在会上宣读了“坚持社会主义！与反党反社会主义的右派分子斗争到底！”的指示草案，并作了说明。他说：农工民主党最后一个时期的动向究竟怎样？发展方针怎样，宣传方针怎样？是社会主义方向，还是非社会主义方向？值得怀疑，需要认真检查一下。我们全党同志要深切思考一下，要从头脑中清除章伯钧思想的毒害，从一切党务活动中检查、批判章伯钧政治阴谋的影响，将农工民主党从可疑的动向中扭转过来，坚决地踏着社会主义道路前进。为了这一目的，中国农工民主党中央执行局决定向全党发出指示。希望大家提出意见。
    在讨论这个指示草案的时候发言的有李伯球、何世琨、王寄一、王人旋、张云川、杨逸棠、杨清源、王一帆、李士豪、徐彬如等。绝大多数人在发言中都认为这个指示应该更加强调指出进一步揭发章伯钧的反动言论和政治阴谋的必要性，号召中央和地方的同志大量揭露这一方面的具体事实；一些人并在会上揭露了章伯钧发表过的反动言论和不利于团结的行为。王一帆还指出：章伯钧的阴谋，已经被广大工人、农民、进步知识分子和一切有觉悟的人初步击碎，现在要严防章伯钧的另一个诡计——金蝉脱壳；必须在全党干净地清除他的影响，彻底肃清有长远历史的“第三条路线”的影响。张云川认为：在这个指示中不应该不说明中央执行局对章伯钧的错误应负一定的责任。他说：章伯钧这些错误言论，早就在党内发表过，我们政治水平低，未能辨别；不但没有与之斗争，有些人还觉得这些言论很好呢！党内同章伯钧接触较多的同志听到的“私房话”恐怕会比章伯钧向史良讲的更多，他们有责任把这些话都揭露出来。会上，还有些人建议把章伯钧过去公开、半公开和个人接触中讲过的错误言论搜集在一起，印出来，发给全党各地的成员讨论。李伯球等提出在这个指示中应该提出要立即在农工民主党内整风，并暂停发展组织。有人认为有必要整风，但不必写入这个文件，可以另发指示。最后大家认为整风和暂停发展组织都很重要，一方面要另发指示，一方面也要在这个指示中写上。
    会议原则上通过了这个指示，决定吸取大家的意见改写以后，在第二天作为正式文件发出。
    会议通过了关于召开六届四中全会（扩大）的议案。召开这次全会的目的，主要是讨论章伯钧的严重错误，和农工民主党整风及发展组织等问题。开会的具体日期和扩大的范围另定。
    接着，经过讨论通过中国农工民主党中央执行局扩大会议为光明日报一度被篡改政治方向的声明。
    然后，会议又通过了关于农工民主党开展整风运动和在整风运动期间暂停发展组织的决议案。这个决议说：农工民主党为拥护中国共产党，拥护社会主义事业，拥护人民民主专政，坚决的和右派思想划清界限，揭发和批判章伯钧等的错误言论，事实上，已在进行党的整风。兹为明确目前首要工作，决定全党进行整风，先从中央作起，逐步推广。整风的方针、步骤和具体内容，由中央执行局制定，另行通告。在整风期间全国各地暂行停止发展组织。
    会议最后讨论了“怎样帮助章伯钧认识错误、深刻检讨、认真交代”的问题。杨子恒提出，可以组织几个小组，一组一组去找章伯钧谈心，用中共提出的整风的方法、和风细雨的方式来帮助他。许多人都不同意杨子恒的这个意见。杨清源说：要确定采取什么方法，先要对章伯钧的错误的性质有一致的认识。他认为，章伯钧的错路已经走到由人民内部矛盾转化为敌我矛盾的边缘了，不是用一般的小组帮助、和风细雨的方式可以解决问题的。李士豪说：章伯钧的问题已经是政治问题了，同他斗争是一场阶级斗争，这斗争是他们右派分子挑起的，是他们先采取了阶级斗争的“大民主”的方式；因此，对他斗争也要有很大的群众压力，首先要尽量在群众中揭发他，要他坦白地交代、检讨；单靠中央几个人的力量，我看不行。李伯球说：章伯钧是资产阶级向社会主义进攻中的一员大将。对他，主要的办法不应该是谈心，他不会听你的。当前最好的办法是把他的荒唐言论揭发出来，在群众面前把他的假面具撕下来。要使他感到已经孤立，不再幻想会有人为他解围；不然他是不会转而向人民靠拢的。罗任一、王善继、何世琨、夏康农、王一帆等也同意杨清源等的意见，认为对走反社会主义道路的人，不能采取和风细雨的方法。至于对右派的斗争究竟是什么性质的矛盾，现在还不要急于作结论；目前主要的任务是尽量揭发具体材料。
    昨天上午和下午，章伯钧都没有出席会议。开会之前，他打电话请假说，前一天晚上睡得很迟，今天需要休息一下，只要精神好一些，就一定来参加会议。在散会前不久，黄琪翔收到了章伯钧的这样一封来信，“今日执行局扩大会议，我上午因有约会，下午又因身体欠佳，均不能参加，十分抱歉，请大家原谅。我对各位同志所作批评十分感谢。我希望成立一个小组对我进行帮助，进行检查。此议如蒙同意，即希见告。不胜感激之至。”
    黄琪翔向大会宣读了这封来信后，引起了大家的极大不满。有人提出，章伯钧表面上说希望大家帮助他检查，他却以各种借口，不同大家照面，是不老实的。也有人指出，章伯钧的“成立小组”的建议本身，就是一种圈套，按照他的意见对他进行“帮助”，只能使农工民主党中央处于无能为力的境地。因此，会议一致决议：农工民主党中央执行局，立即成立对执行局直接负责的检查小组，对章伯钧的错误向各有关人士和有关方面进行调查；同时责成章伯钧把自己的错误言行，向这个小组作出详细的交代。会议还决定，以中央执行局的名义，把这项决议告诉章伯钧，作为对他这次来信的答复。许多人特别指出，这小组不是对章伯钧负责的“帮助小组”，也不能到他家里去谈问题；而是对执行局集体负责的“检查小组”，要叫章伯钧到党部来谈；需要开扩大会的时候，还要由检查小组建议执行局召开。
    黄慎之还在会上提出：不要忘掉李健生。几次开会，她只来了一回，一会儿又走了。她和章伯钧多年相处，什么都知道，却回避这次严肃的政治斗争，是不对的。
    在这次会议上，还有周太玄，武堉干作了书面发言。
