　　Early Planting Leads to Bumper Harvests
　　Agricultural

    The wheat harvest is about to end soon. The wheat fields north of the Huai River and in areas like Shaanxi and Shanxi will soon be sowing summer crops.

    We know that most of these regions mainly rely on autumn crop harvests. Taking Shandong, Henan, and Hebei as examples, the yield of coarse grains and tuber crops accounts for 64% of the total grain (excluding soybeans); the situation is the same in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui. This means that farmers in these areas rely on coarse grains for two-thirds of their grain. This year, Hebei Province's wheat production is estimated to be around 4 billion catties, while the plan for summer crops is 5 billion catties, which is a quarter more than the total wheat production. If these areas do not seize the opportunity for summer planting after the wheat harvest and manage the summer crops well, it will bring great difficulties to our task of completing this year's grain production increase.

    The main characteristic of this year's summer planting work is the increased area for summer planting. All regions must make proper arrangements for summer planting based on this characteristic and should not affect the progress of summer planting due to heavy tasks.

    The main issue with summer planting is to seize the opportunity for early sowing. According to experiments conducted by the Liuheyi Agricultural Cooperative in Zhecheng, Henan Province, corn planted on June 21st yielded 33% less than corn planted on June 15th. The Qingdao Experimental Station in Shandong also conducted experiments in this area. The station found that sweet potatoes transplanted on June 11th yielded 23.1% more than sweet potatoes transplanted on June 25th. From this, it can be seen that striving for early planting is the key to obtaining a bumper harvest of summer crops.

    Summer-planted sweet potatoes account for 70% of the total sweet potato planting area. All regions must guide agricultural cooperatives to plant sweet potatoes well based on their specific local conditions to ensure the total grain output, because the unit yield of sweet potatoes is much higher than other grains in these areas.

    In the Yellow River and Huai River basins, summer-planted soybeans and sesame account for a large proportion. Planting these summer oil crops well will lay the foundation for achieving the oil crop production increase plan.

    The rainy season will come after summer planting. If thinning and mid-cultivation are not done in time, it is often easy to cause seedling shortages. Last year, many agricultural cooperatives abandoned large areas of land due to seedling shortages. This is something to pay attention to after sowing summer crops.

　　早种才能多收

    麦收很快就要结束了。淮河以北和陕西、山西等地区的麦田就要播种夏种作物了。
    我们知道，这些地区中的大部地区，是以大秋作物收获为主的。以山东、河南、河北说，杂粮、薯类作物收量占全部粮食的64％（不包括大豆）；苏北、皖北也是同样情况。这就是说，这些地区的农民，有三分之二的粮食是依靠杂粮的。河北省今年小麦产量估计为四十亿斤左右，而夏种作物的计划则是五十亿斤，比小麦总产量多四分之一。在这些地区假若不抓紧麦后夏种和管理好夏种作物，对我们完成今年粮食增产任务会带来极大的困难。
    今年夏种工作的主要特点是，夏种的面积增大。各地区必须根据这个特点妥善的安排夏种，不能因为任务繁重而影响夏种的进度。
    夏种的主要问题，要抓紧早播。根据河南省柘城六合一农业社的试验，6月21日种的玉米比6月15日种的减产33％。山东青岛试验站也作过这方面的试验，这个站6月11日扦插的甘薯比6月25日扦插的增产23.1％。由此可见，争取早种，是获得夏种作物丰产的关键。
    夏种甘薯占甘薯种植总面积70％，各地必须根据当地的具体情况，领导各农业社种好甘薯以保证粮食的总产量，因为甘薯的单位产量在这些地区比其它谷物高很多。
    在黄河、淮河流域，夏种的大豆、芝麻比重很大，种好这些夏种油料作物，就能为实现增产油料计划打下基础。
    夏种之后雨季即将来临，如间苗、中耕不及时，往往容易造成荒苗现象。去年不少农业社就因为苗荒而荒芜了大面积土地。这是夏种作物播种以后要注意的事情。
