Faure: Franco-Chinese Relations Should be Normalized
    Faure Discusses His Proposals at a Press Conference in Beijing

    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure, who is about to conclude his visit to China, stated at a press conference held in Beijing on June 21 that France and China should restore normal diplomatic relations, and that Western policy towards China is unrealistic.

    In response to a question from our newspaper, Faure said that he has always advocated the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between France and China. During his time in office, one of the guiding principles he followed was to create favorable conditions for resolving this issue. After returning home from this visit, he will do his best to promote the development of relations between the two countries.

    Faure then volunteered a question that had been asked of him: why did he not make the decision to recognize the People's Republic of China when he was Prime Minister? His response was that there were some outstanding world problems that needed to be resolved at that time.

    He further explained that if the policies of the 1955 Geneva Conference could have continued, not only could the relationship between France and China have been resolved, but also the relationship between the United States and China. If a comprehensive solution cannot be reached in the near future, it should first be resolved within the scope of France and China; of course, this requires talks between the governments of the two countries.

    Faure mentioned that the former Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, Édouard Bonnefous, recently advocated recognizing the People's Republic of China, and humorously said that now Bonnefous serves as the Minister of Public Works, so at least one minister in the new French government is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations between France and China.

    Faure said that during his talks with Chinese government leaders, both sides agreed that China and France should currently strive to develop economic and cultural relations. China has agreed to a visit by a French trade delegation.

    He also pointed out that China is a major country, and China should participate in negotiations to resolve disarmament issues.

    Faure expressed his satisfaction with his five-week trip to China and thanked China for the excellent hospitality. He collected some information in China on the joint state-private ownership of industry and commerce and agricultural cooperativization, and was particularly interested in the rectification campaign and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend."

### 法中关系应当正常化  富尔在北京招待记者谈他的主张

　　法中关系应当正常化
    富尔在北京招待记者谈他的主张
    本报讯　即将结束在中国访问的法国前总理埃加·富尔6月21日在北京举行的一次记者招待会上说：法中两国应当恢复正常外交关系，西方对华政策是不现实的。
    富尔在回答本报记者问题时说：他一向主张法中恢复正常外交关系。在他执政时，他所遵循的一个指导思想就是创造解决这个问题的有利条件。在这次访问回国后，他将尽力来促进两国关系的发展。
    富尔随即自动提出曾有人问过他的问题：为什么他在当总理的时候，不采取承认中华人民共和国的决定呢？他的答复是，当时需要解决一些悬而未决的世界性问题。
    他进一步解释说，如果1955年日内瓦会议的政策能够继续下去，不仅可以解决法国和中国的关系问题，而且可以解决美国和中国关系问题。如果在最近的将来还不能在总的范围内得到解决，那就应该先在法中两国范围内解决；当然，这需要两国政府会谈。
    富尔提到法国前国民议会外交委员会主席爱德华·庞纳福最近曾主张承认中华人民共和国，并幽默地说，现在庞纳福担任了公共工程部长，因此在法国这届新政府中至少已经有一个部长是赞成法中两国建立外交关系的了。
    富尔说，他和中国政府领导人员谈话时，双方都认为目前中法两国应该努力发展经济文化关系。中国已经同意法国贸易代表团来华。
    他还指出：中国是大国，解决裁军问题的谈判应该有中国参加。
    富尔对他在中国历时五个星期的旅行表示满意，并且感谢对他的良好的接待。他在中国搜集了一些有关工商业公私合营和农业合作化的资料，并且对整风运动和百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策特别感到兴趣。
