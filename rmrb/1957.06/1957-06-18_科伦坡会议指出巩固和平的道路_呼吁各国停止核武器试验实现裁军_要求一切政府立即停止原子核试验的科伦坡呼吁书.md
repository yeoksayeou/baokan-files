The Colombo Conference Points Out the Road to Consolidating Peace
Calls on All Countries to Stop Nuclear Weapon Tests and Achieve Disarmament
Colombo Appeal Demands All Governments Immediately Stop Nuclear Tests

    Eminent scientists have made the world aware of the dangers arising from the continued conduct of nuclear tests. The governments, parliaments, organizations and moral and religious leaders of many countries have called for an end to such tests.
    The World Peace Council, which has launched a broad movement throughout the world to achieve a nuclear test ban, sees in this great movement of public opinion an increasingly powerful expression of the common will of all peace forces and all peoples.
    Despite this strong expression of world opinion, test explosions continue to pollute the air, land and sea, and threaten the future of all mankind. These test explosions are the culmination of the arms race now in progress, and could ultimately lead to the final horrors of atomic war.
    We call on the governments concerned to immediately declare a cessation of all test explosions and to accelerate negotiations to reach an agreement banning all such tests.
    Proposals to limit or register tests do not solve the problem, as they would not result in a cessation of tests.
    An agreement to cease test explosions, on the other hand, would build confidence, improve the international situation by easing tensions, and thus pave the way for a complete ban on these inhumane weapons of mass destruction and for comprehensive disarmament.
    In the name of everything that is sacred to humanity, we appeal to the governments of the world to take action to support an immediate end to such tests.

Declaration Calling for a Cessation of Nuclear Weapon Tests and Disarmament
    The people of all countries are affected by the arms race, which consumes vast resources and creates a certain danger of war. The most disturbing manifestation of this arms race is the series of nuclear weapon test explosions.
    On April 2, the World Peace Council called for a cessation of all test explosions. Since then, people have become more clearly aware of the dangers of such explosions.
    No one in the world can claim that he will not be affected by such explosions, whether now or in the future, and therefore, public opinion in various countries has risen up in opposition. The scale of these tests is unprecedented.
    The tests not only threaten the lives and health of many people, but also accelerate the atomic arms race. The result of these tests is the production and testing of more heinous weapons. These tests encourage countries possessing nuclear weapons to conduct larger explosions. These tests stimulate other countries to produce similar weapons, making tensions even more serious.
    Another form of the atomic arms race is the conversion of existing military bases into atomic bases and the establishment of new bases in foreign countries.
    Through various conventions and treaties, the armed forces of some countries are to obtain so-called tactical nuclear weapons.
    However, these weapons increase the danger that any local dispute can quickly turn into an atomic war.
    This arms race makes tensions even more serious, undermines the independence of many countries, and puts innocent people at risk of becoming the first victims of an atomic war launched from among them.
    Calling these weapons tactical does not hide the fact that some of them have the same destructive power as the bombs dropped on Hiroshima. On the other hand, the pretext of saving military spending is not sufficient justification for equipping armies with these weapons.
    Vast resources that could be used for the peaceful use of atomic energy and for the general welfare are being diverted to the production and equipment of new atomic weapons.
    The people of all countries demand a cessation of nuclear tests. The parliaments of many countries have demanded this, and the governments of many countries have suggested this. One of these is a major power that itself possesses nuclear weapons. New voices of the most authoritative figures can be heard every day. This proposal can be adopted immediately, because there are no difficulties in supervising its implementation. The people of all countries, by intensifying their efforts, can strive for an immediate cessation of test explosions.
    A cessation of tests would slow down the arms race. Such a truce would be so popular that any government that violates it would inevitably be condemned by the whole world. After this step has ignited hope and restored trust, it will be easier to reach agreement on the complete prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and universal disarmament.
    In the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, the differences between the various proposals have narrowed. With regard to conventional armaments and their supervision, several countries have put forward constructive proposals. The proposals that have been put on the table prove that an agreement is possible, if all parties are sincere.
    The World Peace Council welcomes and supports any action taken by any government aimed at facilitating an agreement on the cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.
    World public opinion should put pressure on those governments that hesitate or refuse to take this path.
    The World Peace Council, meeting in the continent that has been most severely burned by the atomic fire, issues the Colombo Declaration to all governments, demanding an immediate cessation of nuclear tests.
    The World Peace Council supports all steps taken in this direction.

Resolution on Easing Tensions and Related Issues
    In this nuclear age, suspicion is poisoning relations between nations and has brought mankind to the brink of destruction. The task of the people of all countries is to restore international mutual trust and prevent the occurrence of a worldwide catastrophe.
    From Asia and other parts of the world, the Bandung Conference, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the declarations of many responsible politicians, these many voices of peace have aroused the hopes of mankind. No matter how great the obstacles to peace, these hopes must be realized and can be realized. Everywhere in the world, there is evidence of mankind's determination to end hatred and confrontation, and to move resolutely towards peaceful coexistence and cooperation.
    This conference is the first conference of the World Peace Council held in Asia, and it is the most representative conference, a large gathering of four hundred and two people from sixty-nine countries in Colombo. At this conference, we call on the people of all countries to end the division of the world into two hostile blocs, to end the phenomenon that a large part of humanity does not enjoy the rights to national independence and human freedom that the people of other countries are able to enjoy, and to end the spreading of hatred and suspicion. We call for the renunciation of force and interference, the end of nuclear threats and competition, the withdrawal of troops and bases from foreign territories, and the establishment of mutual trust.
    Ruling people by colonialism—whether in its old or new form—or by indirect pressure such as incorporation into blocs and military treaties, using the human and material resources of other countries for the purpose of military, political and economic infiltration, aid with "conditions" attached, discrimination or restrictions in trade, all these practices not only bring submission and suffering, but may also increase the danger of war.
    As long as the aspirations of the people of all countries for independence are suppressed by force, true peace will not exist. This is why the struggle of the people for economic and political independence is a direct contribution to the cause of peace, and the struggle of the people for economic and political independence is a right stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.
    Restrictions on economic and cultural exchanges between the people of all countries must be lifted, and all prohibitions and obstacles to trade, travel and communication must be removed. All countries must be able to freely pass through international straits in accordance with international law. All exchanges between the people of all countries that contribute to mutual understanding and friendship must be promoted.
    The policy of establishing blocs and military treaties must be stopped. Major powers must hold talks in a spirit of understanding and mutual concession. Major powers must eliminate all obstacles that hinder the victory of the spirit of peace between nations and within each nation.
    Membership in the United Nations must be truly universal, and the People's Republic of China must be given its legitimate status, which is a necessary means to enable the United Nations to play its due role in maintaining world peace.
    In Europe, the first step must be to strive for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, the abolition of all foreign bases, and the end of all foreign interference in various countries. This can be done in stages in order to ease tensions as soon as possible and eliminate military blocs. This will pave the way for the establishment of a single security system that is acceptable to all; this will make it easier for Germany to be reunified and end the state of Germany being divided into two camps.
    Since the failure of the tripartite aggression against Egypt, the threats faced by Arab countries have continued to increase. Pressure on Middle Eastern countries and interference in their internal affairs continue, and the situation remains serious. World public opinion, which contributed to stopping the attack on Egypt, must continue to be vigilant.
    The doctrine of "power vacuum" threatens the security and independence of Middle Eastern countries, and this doctrine further deepens the danger. The practice of infringing on the sovereignty of the people of various countries in the Middle East must be stopped, and the threat of launching aggression again must be eliminated. If it is to help ease tensions in the Middle East and open the way for the people of various countries in the Middle East to peacefully resolve their problems in the spirit of Bandung, then these measures are essential.
    The war in Algeria must be stopped; the Algerian people cannot be deprived of their right to independence; negotiations between equal parties can establish new relations in freedom, and a solution must also be sought that meets the true interests of the Algerian people and the true interests of the French people. Enabling the people of Cyprus to obtain the right to self-determination is a necessary step towards peace. Suppression must be stopped, and the British government must begin negotiations without delay that the United Nations has requested to be held in order to achieve this goal. Similarly, the people of all other dependent countries and colonial countries must obtain the national independence they deserve.
    Foreign attempts to strengthen military, political and economic control over Latin American countries through a series of treaties must be stopped, foreign countries must stop interfering in their internal affairs, and their economic independence must be fully guaranteed.
    The unification of the Korean people and the Vietnamese people in accordance with just and free agreements stipulated by international obligations is also a necessary step to obtain peace. The threat posed by foreign interference in Taiwan, a Chinese territory, is made more serious and more urgent by plans to establish nuclear weapon bases in Taiwan. This interference must be stopped without delay.
    These are the ways to achieve the common hope of consolidating a lasting and just peace.
    International disputes should not and cannot be resolved by force or the threat of force. There is no problem that cannot be resolved through negotiation.
    Peace cannot be saved solely by the power of governments or the efforts of a very few people, no matter how outstanding these people are. Peace will be saved by the people, by the activities of the great peace movement, and this can only be achieved when the peace movement can coordinate its efforts with the efforts of all vital forces and all peace-loving people in the world.

### 科伦坡会议指出巩固和平的道路　呼吁各国停止核武器试验实现裁军　要求一切政府立即停止原子核试验的科伦坡呼吁书

　　科伦坡会议指出巩固和平的道路
　　呼吁各国停止核武器试验实现裁军
　　要求一切政府立即停止原子核试验的科伦坡呼吁书
    著名的科学家们已经使全世界认识到继续进行原子核试验所产生的危险。很多国家的政府、议会、各种团体以及道义和宗教的领袖们已经要求终止这种试验。
    已经在世界各地发动广大运动以求达成原子核停战的世界和平理事会，在这个伟大的舆论运动中看到了一切和平力量和全体人民的共同意志的愈来愈有力的表示。
    尽管有世界舆论这种强有力的表示，试验爆炸仍在继续染污空气、陆地和海水，并且威胁全体人类的前途。这些试验爆炸是现在正在进行的军备竞赛的顶点，并且能在最后引起原子战争的最后恐怖。
    我们要求有关政府立即宣布停止一切试验爆炸，并且加速进行谈判来就禁止所有这种试验达成一项协议。
    限制或登记试验的建议并不解决问题，因为这些建议并不会造成停止试验。
    而一项停止试验爆炸的协议就将会建立信任，通过缓和紧张局势而改善国际形势，从而为完全禁止这些大规模毁灭性的不人道武器以及为全面裁军开辟道路。
    我们以一切对于人类是神圣的东西的名义，吁求世界各国政府采取行动，支持立即终止这种试验。
　　要求停止原子核武器试验和裁军的宣言
    世界各国人民都受到消耗了大量资源并且造成了一定战争危险的军备竞赛的影响。这种军备竞赛的最令人不安的表现就是一连串又一连串的原子核武器的试验爆炸。
    4月2日，世界和平理事会呼吁停止一切试验爆炸。从那时起，人们更清楚地认识到这种爆炸的危险性。
    世界上没有一个人能够硬说，不论在现在还是将来他都不会受到这种爆炸的影响，因此，各国的舆论已经起来反对了。这种试验的规模是空前未有的。
    试验不仅威胁着许多人的生命和健康，而且还加速了原子军备竞赛。这种试验的结果是生产和试验更多的穷凶极恶的武器。这种试验促使拥有原子核武器的国家进行规模更大的爆炸。这种试验刺激其它国家生产类似的武器，使得紧张局势变得更为严重。
    原子军备竞赛的另一种形式是，把现有的军事基地变为原子基地和在外国建立新的基地。
    通过各种公约和条约，有一些国家的武装部队要得到所谓战术性的原子武器。
    但是，这种武器使得任何局部性的争执可以迅速变成一场原子战争的危险增加了。
    这种军备竞赛使得紧张局势变得更为严重，破坏了许多国家的独立，并且使无辜的人民有首先成为从他们中间发动的原子战争的受难者的危险。
    把这种武器叫作战术性武器并不能掩盖其中有些武器同投在广岛的炸弹具有同样大的毁灭力的事实，在另一方面，节约军事开支的口实也不足作为用这种武器来装备军队的理由。
    本来可以用于原子能的和平利用和普遍福利的大量资源都被转用来生产新的原子武器和装备了。
    各国人民要求停止原子核试验。许多国家的议会要求这样做，许多国家的政府建议这样做。其中就有一个本身拥有原子核武器的大国。每天都可以听到最权威的人士的新的呼声。这个建议是可以立即采纳的，因为对这个建议的实施实行监督并没有什么困难。各国人民只要加紧努力就可以争取立即停止爆炸试验。
    停止试验就会使军备竞赛缓下来。这种停战会深得人心，以致任何政府如果加以破坏，必然遭到举世一致的谴责。在这一步骤使人们燃起希望和恢复信任以后，就更容易在完全禁止大规模毁灭性武器和普遍裁军问题上达成协议了。
    在联合国裁军小组委员会里，各种主张之间的分歧已经缩小了。就常规军备及其监督而论，好几个国家已经提出了建设性的建议。已经提到桌面上来的建议证明，达成协议是可能的，如果各方面都有诚意的话。
    世界和平理事会欢迎，并且支持任何政府采取的目的在于促成关于停止一切原子核武器试验的协议的任何行动。
    世界舆论应当对那些犹豫不决或者拒绝走这条路的政府施加压力。
    在这个被原子烈火烧得最厉害的大陆举行会议的世界和平理事会向所有政府发出科伦坡宣言，要求立即停止原子核试验。
    世界和平理事会支持在这个方向采取的一切步骤。
　　关于缓和紧张局势和有关问题的决议
    在这个原子核时代中，猜疑正在毒化国与国之间的关系，并且已经使人类濒于毁灭的边缘。各国人民的任务是要恢复国际间的互相信任和防止发生世界范围的灾祸。
    从亚洲和世界其他各地，万隆会议、潘查希拉五项原则、许多负责的政治家的宣言，这许多和平的呼声唤起了人类的希望。不论和平的障碍多么大，这些希望必须实现而且能够实现。世界各个地方都证明了人类有决心停止仇恨和对抗，有决心毅然走向和平共处和合作。
    这次会议是世界和平理事会在亚洲举行的第一次会议，是最具有代表性的一次会议，是来自六十九个国家的四百零二人在科伦坡的大集会。在这次会议上，我们要求各国人民终止把世界分裂成为两个敌对集团的局面，终止一大部分人类享受不到其他国家人民能够享受的民族独立和人类自由权利的现象，终止散布仇恨和猜疑的行为。我们要求放弃武力和干涉，终止原子核威胁和竞争，从外国领土上撤出军队和基地，建立互相信任。
    用殖民主义——不论是旧形式的还是新形式的——或者用拉入集团和军事条约这类间接的压力来统治人民，利用别国的人力和物质资源以实现军事、政治和经济上渗入的目的，附有“条件”的援助，贸易方面的歧视或限制，所有这些做法不仅带来屈从和痛苦，而且可能增加发生战争的危险。
    只要各国人民要求独立的愿望还受到武力的压抑，真正的和平就不会存在。这就是为什么人民争取经济独立和政治独立的斗争是对和平事业的一个直接贡献的原因，而人民争取经济独立和政治独立是联合国宪章规定的权利。
    必须取消对各国人民之间的经济和文化交流的限制，必须取消对贸易、旅行和联络的各种禁令和障碍。必须根据国际法使所有国家都能够自由地通过国际海峡。必须促进各国人民间一切有助于相互谅解和友谊的交往。
    必须停止建立集团和军事条约的政策。大国必须本着谅解和互相让步的精神举行会谈。大国必须消除妨碍国家之间和每个国家内部的和平精神得到胜利的一切障碍。
    联合国的会员国资格必须有真正的普遍性，必须使中华人民共和国得到它的合法地位，这是使联合国组织在维护世界和平方面能够起应有的作用的必要手段。
    在欧洲，第一个步骤必须是争取撤退所有的外国军队，取消所有外国基地，并且结束所有外国对各国的干涉。这可以分阶段进行，以便能及早缓和紧张局势，消除军事集团。这将为建立一个为大家所能接受的单一安全体系铺平道路；这将使德国比较容易统一，结束德国被分成两个阵营的状态。
    自从三国侵略埃及失败以来，阿拉伯国家所遭受的威胁仍然有增无减。对中东国家施加压力和干涉它们内政的作法仍然继续，局势仍然严重。曾经在制止对埃及的进攻方面作出贡献的世界舆论，必须继续保持警惕。
    由于“力量真空”主义威胁中东地区各国的安全和独立，这个主义更加加深了危险。侵犯中东地区各国人民主权的作法必须停止，重新发动侵略的威胁必须消除。如果要想有助于缓和中东地区的紧张局势，并且本着万隆精神打开中东地区各国人民和平解决他们的问题的道路，那么，这些措施就是必不可少的。
    阿尔及利亚的战争必须停止；不能剥夺阿尔及利亚人民获得独立的权利；在平等的双方之间进行谈判才能在自由中建立起新的关系，同时也必须求得既符合阿尔及利亚全国人民的真正利益、又符合法国人民的真正利益的解决办法。使塞浦路斯人民获得自决权利，是走向和平的必要步骤。镇压必须停止，联合国为了争取达到这一目的而要求举行的谈判，英国政府必须毫不拖延地开始举行。同样，其他一切附属国家和殖民地国家的人民，都必须获得他们应得的民族独立。
    外国企图借着一系列的条约，在军事、政治和经济方面加强对拉丁美洲国家的控制，这种尝试必须停止，外国必须停止干涉它们的内政，它们的经济独立必须获得充分的保障。
    朝鲜人民和越南人民按照国际义务规定的公正而自由的协议取得统一，这也是获得和平的必要步骤。外国对中国领土台湾的干涉所造成的威胁，由于在台湾建立核武器基地的计划而更加严重、更加紧迫了。必须毫不迟延地制止这种干涉。
    这些就是要达到大家共同希望的巩固、持久而公正的和平的道路。
    国际争端不应该而且也不能用武力或者武力的威胁来求得解决。没有任何问题不能通过谈判获得解决。
    仅仅靠政府的力量或者很少数几个人的努力，是不能拯救和平的，不论这些人是多么卓越的人物。和平将为人民、为伟大的和平运动的活动所拯救，而这只有在和平运动能够把它的努力同全世界一切有生力量和一切爱好和平的人们的努力配合起的时候才能做到。（新华社科伦坡17日电）
