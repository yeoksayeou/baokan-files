Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: A national representative meeting against military bases was held in Tokyo today, resolving to demand an immediate halt to the expansion of American military bases and the return of Okinawa's administrative rights from the United States.

The meeting also passed a resolution demanding that the American murderer, Girard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman, be handed over to Japan for trial.

Former Tokyo University President Shigeru Nanbara and six current university presidents today submitted a joint request to Nobusuke Kishi, urging him to strive for the United States to return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan as soon as possible during his visit to Washington.

The Japan Youth Group Council, with four million members, also requested on June 13th that Nobusuke Kishi demand the return of Okinawa's administrative rights to Japan during his visit to the United States.

On the same day, the Japan Socialist Party presented ten demands to Nobusuke Kishi, who will visit the United States on the 16th.

In this document, delivered to Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishida by Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and others, the Japan Socialist Party demanded the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and opposed making the signing of bilateral military agreements, amending the current constitution, and bringing nuclear weapons into Japan as bargaining chips for revising the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement. The Socialist Party also demanded that the Japanese government publicly announce the already drafted plan for revising the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement.

The Socialist Party demanded that Nobusuke Kishi cease the practice of taking long-term military expansion plans to the United States for discussion without first discussing them in the Diet. The Socialist Party pointed out that doing so would not only make the Japan-U.S. talks unfavorable to Japan but also violate the Japanese constitution.

The Japanese "Defense Council" has finally approved the three-year military expansion goals of Japan's "Long-Term Defense Plan." The plan stipulates that by fiscal year 1960 (April 1960 to the end of March 1961), Japan will expand its army to 180,000 troops, increase the tonnage of its navy's ships to 124,000 tons, and increase the number of its air force's aircraft to 1,300.

The Socialist Party demanded that Nobusuke Kishi refuse to bring nuclear weapons into Japan. The Socialist Party pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's remarks that Japan possessing nuclear weapons "does not violate the constitution" is a most dangerous path of subordination to the United States.

The Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese government, based on its own judgment, take action to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and adhere to a greatly relaxed "embargo" policy.

The Socialist Party also demanded that Nobusuke Kishi firmly demand that the United States return the administrative rights of Okinawa to Japan.

The demands made by the Socialist Party to Nobusuke Kishi also included: urging Nobusuke Kishi to push the United States to immediately ban nuclear weapons and sign agreements banning nuclear weapons with other major powers; respecting the spirit of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference; and making no concessions on the issue of Japan trying the American soldier Girard who shot and killed a Japanese woman.

Prior to this, on June 13th, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi appealed to the United States for strong support for the Japanese conservative government to prevent Japan from being pushed towards neutralism or adopting a "pro-communist policy."

He said that the path taken by the Japanese government is definitely the path of the "free world." "We do not follow the path of neutralism or communist policies."

Nobusuke Kishi revealed that he would also discuss the following issues during his visit to the United States: strengthening Japan's military; "territorial issues" (including Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands occupied by the United States, as well as the southern part of the Kuril Islands already returned to the Soviet Union); Japan-U.S. economic cooperation; and issues related to Southeast Asia.

Nobusuke Kishi said that he wanted to make the United States understand Japan's desire to develop trade. He mentioned Japan's hope that its exports to the United States would be unrestricted. At the same time, he also said that the Japanese government does not intend to recognize China, but it hopes to increase some trade with China. He explained that Japan will not follow Britain's actions to relax the embargo on China, but the United States knows that Japan would like to relax restrictions.

　　东京举行全国反对军事基地大会
　　日本各界疾呼收回冲绳岛行政权
　　社会党提出修改对美政策的十项要求
    本报综合报道　据新华社14日讯：今天在东京举行全国反对军事基地代表会议，决议要求立即停止扩大美国军事基地并且从美国手里收回冲绳岛的行政权。
    会议还通过决议，要求把枪杀日本妇女的美国凶手哲腊德交给日本审判。
    前东京大学校长南原繁和六位现任大学校长今天向岸信介提出了一份联合要求书，要求他在访问华盛顿的时候努力使美国尽快地把冲绳岛和小笠原群岛归还日本。
    拥有四百万会员的日本青年团协议会在6月13日也要求岸信介在他访问美国的时候要求美国把冲绳岛的行政权归还日本。
    同一天，日本社会党向将在16日赴美国访问的岸信介提出了十项要求。
    日本社会党在这份由社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等交给内阁官房长官石田的要求书中，要求取消日美安全条约，并且反对把签订双边军事协定、修改现行宪法和把核武器运进日本做为修改日美行政协定的交换条件。社会党并且要求日本政府公开发表已经拟好的修改日美行政协定的方案。
    社会党要求岸信介停止不经国会讨论就把长期扩军计划带到美国讨论的做法。社会党指出，日本政府这样做不仅将使日美会谈不利于日本，而且也违反日本的宪法。
    日本“国防会议”已经最后通过了日本“长期防卫计划”的三年扩军目标。这个计划规定，到1960年度（1960年4月至1961年3月底），日本要把陆军扩充到十八万人，把海军的舰艇吨数增加到十二万四千吨，把空军的飞机增加到一千三百架。
    社会党要求岸信介拒绝把核武器运进日本。社会党指出，岸信介关于日本拥有核武器“不违反宪法”的言论是一个从属于美国的最危险的道路。
    社会党要求日本政府根据自己的判断，采取行动来促进日中邦交的正常化，并且坚持大大放宽“禁运”的方针。
    社会党还要求岸信介坚决要求美国把冲绳岛的行政权交还日本。
    社会党向岸信介提出的要求还包括：要求岸信介促使美国立即禁止核武器，并且同其他大国签订禁止核武器的协定；尊重万隆会议十项原则的精神；在由日本审判枪杀日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德问题上决不作任何让步。
    在这以前，日本首相岸信介13日向美国呼吁大力支持日本保守政府，以免日本被推向中立主义或者采取“亲共政策”。
    他说，日本政府所采取的路线肯定地是“自由世界”的路线。“我们不追随中立主义的路线或者共产党政策”。
    岸信介透露，他在访问美国的时候还将讨论下列问题：加强日本的军备；“领土问题”（包括美国占领的冲绳和小笠原群岛以及已经归还苏联的千岛群岛南部）；日美经济合作；有关东南亚的问题。
    岸信介说，他要使美国了解日本希望发展贸易的观点。他谈到日本希望它对美国的输出不受限制。同时，他又说，日本政府不打算承认中国，它希望和中国增加一些贸易。他说明，日本将不追随英国的放宽对中国的禁运的行动，但是，美国知道日本是喜欢放宽限制的。
