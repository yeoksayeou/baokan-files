Those Who Vainly Attempt to Sow Discord Are Doomed to Fail
Peasants and Workers Will Unite More Closely
Si Jiqing Agricultural Cooperative Members Refute Anti-Socialist Rhetoric and Protest Anonymous Letters

　　This newspaper reports that the recent anti-socialist rhetoric published in newspapers has aroused anger among members of the Si Jiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing.
　　Every production team and many households in this cooperative have wired radio speakers and subscribe to newspapers. In the past, before or after work, the members always happily listened to beautiful songs and read inspiring news about construction. However, recently, what they have heard and seen are arguments that are incompatible with their own feelings. For example, talk about how the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the policy of unified purchase and supply have been messed up; that the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill communists; that the current world belongs to the Communist Party's "Party world," and "If the Communist Party dies, China will not die," and so on. They felt surprised and angry. In the morning, when everyone was studying together, the cooperative director, Shen Duo, said angrily: "These people are clearly trying to sow discord, why are they allowed to talk nonsense?" Then, everyone began to discuss. This cooperative mainly produces vegetables, and these people have suffered greatly from price fluctuations and not being able to buy food in the past, but now they don't have to worry about these things at all. They did the math. Last year, the entire cooperative of more than 800 households paid less than 300,000 jin of public grain to the state, but the state supplied them with more than 1.4 million jin of grain according to supply standards, which allowed the members to concentrate on production without worrying too much about the grain problem. Therefore, they personally experienced that the state's policy of unified purchase and supply is precisely to ensure that both urban and rural people have food to eat. They said, is this the result of unified purchase and supply being messed up and the Communist Party making mistakes?
　　Some people are discussing in the newspapers whether or not to have the leadership of the Party, whether or not to have socialism, and everyone feels even more strange about this question. They believe that the Si Jiqing Agricultural Cooperative is developing year by year, and the lives of the members are improving year by year. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, how could there be today? This is the simplest and clearest thing, how can anyone still raise such a question today? Of course, many members know that there are many problems in the cooperative, such as the unreasonable work evaluation and scorekeeping, certain contradictions in the interests of new and old members, and middle and poor peasant members, and the need to further strengthen the connection between cadres and the masses, and between the Party and the masses, and that the unified purchase and supply of grain does not adequately take care of some households with special difficulties, etc. But, can it be said that this is the Communist Party's mistake in leading everyone to take the socialist road? Since listening to Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the leading cadres of the cooperative have mobilized the masses to sum up the ten specific contradictions existing in the cooperative, and now everyone is confidently resolving these contradictions. Everyone said that this is completely different from what Ge Peiqi, Wang Dezhou and those people said.
　　The members of the Si Jiqing Agricultural Cooperative, from their own life experiences, know best what they should hate and what they should support. After work, the members of the greenhouse production team gathered in the team office to discuss the many articles and news published in the newspapers. Middle-aged team member Han Dekuan, talking about Ge Peiqi's opinion that "the relationship between the Party and the masses is 108,000 miles worse than before liberation," said with a mocking tone: Did this person reverse the statement? If he represents the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, this may make some sense. But we peasants know best what society has given us. When the Japanese were here, we couldn't even eat our fill of mixed noodles; count, which of us here hasn't been beaten by the Japanese police and military police! In the past, when we went to the city to sell vegetables, it was really "a fast horse can't catch up with the green vegetable market - a price at any moment." How ruthless the profiteers were when they bit and slaughtered people! If there were too many vegetables, the vegetable stations controlled by those capitalists simply wouldn't buy them; they wouldn't buy them until the market was about to close, when they would suppress the price to buy them. Conversely, the price of grain rose at any moment, and today you sold vegetables, tomorrow you couldn't buy grain. This is the "benefit" that capitalism gave us. But today, do these things that harm us peasants still exist? The facts are before our eyes, needless to say, everyone knows it clearly. On what basis does Ge Peiqi say that our relationship with the Communist Party is 108,000 miles worse than before liberation? Old farmer Li Wencheng, squatting next to a vegetable basket, pointed to his broken vegetable cart outside and said: This vegetable cart is the witness of my past suffering. Whether the Japanese devils were here or the Kuomintang were here, I pulled a cart of vegetables into the city, shouted all day, and still had to come back hungry. Think about the past, compare it to the present, it's really 108,000 miles different!
　　The Si Jiqing Agricultural Cooperative was originally a mutual aid group with only a few households, but now it has developed into an agricultural cooperative with more than 800 households. As production develops, the lives of the members are improving year by year. Last year and this year, each full laborer can generally receive about 600 yuan, and most families have built new houses. Before liberation, beggars were everywhere in the village, but now not a single household is starving. These are all the benefits brought by socialism. They said, if there was no Communist Party to lead the way, could we have embarked on this happy road? Member Wei Qingfu pointed to the endless vegetables in front of him and the newly purchased six pot-support machines that were making a rattling sound and said: Our "Si Jiqing" is socialism, whoever wants to abolish socialism wants to abolish our beloved "Si Jiqing", and we resolutely disagree.
　　After seeing the news in the newspapers that the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant opposed the fallacy of leaving socialism and denounced the despicable means of anonymous threatening letters, the members also demanded to publicly express their opinions. They said that some people speak in the newspapers because they want to sow discord between the peasants and the Communist Party, and sow discord between the peasants and the working class elder brothers. But we will always stand together with the Communist Party and with the working class elder brothers. As the sun leaned against the mountain, the people in the fields gradually walked home, and the discussion became more and more vigorous. Han Dekuan stepped onto a small mound in the noisy crowd and shouted, raising his fist: "Someone wants to scare people with anonymous threatening letters, we are not afraid of anything when we unite with the working class elder brothers. We oppose the opinions of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping and others. If they are not convinced, please come to 'Si Jiqing' and argue with us!"

### 妄想挑拨是非的人一定要失败  农民和工人将团结得更紧密  四季青农业社社员驳斥反社会主义言论并抗议匿名信

　　妄想挑拨是非的人一定要失败
　　农民和工人将团结得更紧密
　　四季青农业社社员驳斥反社会主义言论并抗议匿名信
    本报讯  最近报纸上登载的某些人的反社会主义言论，引起了北京郊区四季青农业生产合作社社员们的愤怒。
    这个合作社的每一个生产队和许多家庭都安装着有线广播器，订有报纸。往日，社员们出工前或者收工后，总是乐津津地听着美妙的歌曲和读着振奋人心的建设消息。可是，最近这些日子，他们听到和看到的却有一种和自己的情感格格不入的论调。例如什么肃反、统购统销搞糟了；什么群众要推翻共产党，杀共产党人；什么现在的天下是共产党的“党天下”，“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”等等的话。他们感到惊讶和愤怒。早晨，大家在一起学习的时候，社主任申多气愤地说：“这些人明明是在挑拨是非，为什么让他们胡言乱语？”接着，大家便议论起来。这个社是以生产蔬菜为主，这些人过去都深受过物价波动、有钱买不到粮食之苦，可是现在这些事全用不着担心了。他们算了一笔账。去年一年全社八百多户共缴给国家不到三十万斤公粮，而国家却按供应标准供应了他们一百四十多万斤粮食，这就能使社员们安心生产，不用在吃粮问题上多操心了。因此他们亲身体会到国家的统购统销政策正是为了保证城乡人民都有粮食吃。他们说，这难道就是统购统销搞糟了、共产党犯了错误吗？
    有人在报纸上讨论要不要党的领导，要不要社会主义，大家更感到这问题提得奇怪。他们认为，四季青农业社一年比一年发展，社员生活一年比一年提高，没有共产党的领导，怎么会有今天？这真是最简单最明白不过的事情了，怎么今天还会有人提出这样的问题来？当然，许多社员都知道，社里是存在着不少问题的，像评工记分有些不合理，新老社员、中农贫农社员在利益方面还有某些矛盾，干部和群众、党和群众之间的联系还需要进一步密切，粮食统购统销对某些有特殊困难的户还照顾不够等等。可是，能说这是共产党领导大家走社会主义道路的错误吗？自从听了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告以后，社的领导干部已经发动群众总结出社里存在的十项具体矛盾，现在大家正在满怀信心地解决这些矛盾。大家说，这和葛佩琦、王德周那些人说的完全是两回事。
    四季青农业社的社员们从自己的生活经验中，最知道自己应该憎恨什么，拥护什么。温室生产队的队员们收工以后，聚集在队部办公室里，议论报纸上登的许多文章和消息。中年队员韩德宽谈到葛佩琦的“党群关系与解放前相比，差了十万八千里”的意见，带着嘲笑的口吻说：这个人把话说反了个儿？他自己要是代表大地主、大资产阶级说话，这话也许还有点道理。可是咱们农民最清楚什么社会给了咱什么东西。日本在这的时候，咱混合面都吃不饱；数数看，咱这一伙人那个没挨过日本警察和宪兵的打！过去我们进城卖菜，真是“快马赶不上青菜行——一时一价”。奸商咬牙宰人多狠哪！蔬菜上的多了，那些资本家把持的菜站偏不买；非等到快散市了，他们才压价收购。反过来，粮价一时一涨，今天卖了菜，明天就买不来粮食。这就是资本主义给咱们的“好处”。可是今天，这些坑害咱农民的事还有没有？事实摆在眼前，不用说，谁心里也清楚。葛佩琦根据哪一条说咱和共产党的关系比解放前差十万八千里？蹲在菜筐旁边的老农李文成指着外面他的一辆破菜车，说：这辆菜车就是我过去受苦受难的见证人。不管日本鬼子在这也好，国民党在这也好，我拉着一车菜进城，吆喝一天，还得饿着肚子回来。想想过去，比比现在，才真差十万八千里呢！
    四季青农业社最初是个只有几户的互助组，现在发展到八百多户的农业社，社员们随着生产的发展，生活一年比一年提高。他们去年和今年每个整劳动力一般都能分到六百元左右，大多数人家修盖了新房。解放前，乡里讨饭的成群，现在没有一户挨饿的。这些都是社会主义带来的好处。他们说，要是没有共产党领路，能走上这条幸福的大道吗？社员魏庆福指着眼前一片无际的蔬菜和那突突响着的新买的六部锅驮机说：我们“四季青”就是社会主义，谁要想取消社会主义，就是想取消我们心爱的“四季青”，我们坚决不答应。
    社员们从报纸上看到石景山钢铁厂职工反对离开社会主义的谬论、痛斥匿名恐吓信的卑鄙手段的消息以后，也要求公开发表自己的意见。他们说，有些人在报纸上发言，就是想挑拨农民和共产党的关系，挑拨农民和工人老大哥的关系。可是我们和共产党、和工人老大哥永远站在一起。太阳靠山了，田野里的人们陆续往家里走，议论越来越有劲。韩德宽在嘈杂的人声中踏上一个小土堆，举起拳头来喊着：“有人想拿匿名恐吓信吓唬人，咱和工人老大哥团结起来什么也不怕。我们反对葛佩琦、储安平这些人的意见。他们要是不服气，就请他们到‘四季青’来和我们辩理！”
