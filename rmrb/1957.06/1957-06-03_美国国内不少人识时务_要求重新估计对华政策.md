Xinhua News Agency, June 1st, Washington dispatch: The panic caused by the demonstrations in Taipei has not yet subsided, and the British decision to independently relax trade restrictions with China has followed closely. More American newspapers and political figures are raising the demand that the United States should "bite the bullet and re-evaluate" its policy of comprehensive economic, political, and diplomatic embargo against China.

    Nolan yesterday criticized the British decision in Congress as "taking incomprehensible risks" in Asia, and another Senator Ellender clamored for stopping American "aid" to Britain. However, some Democratic congressmen and newspapers such as the "New York Herald Tribune" believe that the British decision is beyond reproach. More people are turning their attention to the US's own China policy. The "Star," Washington's largest-circulation evening newspaper, said yesterday that "for some time past, the value of American policy has been questionable. Now this policy has completely failed as a means of exerting pressure on Beijing."

    The newspaper said that the total "embargo" policy insisted upon by the United States "is now merely an ineffective effort to keep the whole world at loggerheads with the Chinese Communists at a time when the whole world is simply unwilling to be at loggerheads." It advocates a "thorough re-evaluation" of the US government's view of Asia.

    The "Washington Daily News," Washington's second-largest evening newspaper, published an article by its London correspondent stating that European "allies" almost unanimously oppose the US's China policy, and European countries believe that US support for the Chiang Kai-shek group is "worthless."

    According to Reuters, many people in the US Congress say that Britain cannot be blamed for "going it alone" now. The question now is: Given that many other allies are expected to follow Britain's lead, can the United States itself "go it alone" and continue to implement its current China policy?

    美国国内不少人识时务  要求重新估计对华政策
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：台北示威引起的惊慌还远没有减退，英国单独放宽对华贸易限制的决定又接踵而来，更多的美国报纸和政界人士提出了这样的要求：应该“忍痛重新估价”，美国所奉行的对中国进行全面经济、政治和外交抵制的政策。
    诺兰昨天在国会里指责英国的决定是在亚洲“冒难以理解的危险”，另一个参议员埃伦德叫嚷要对英国停止美“援”。但是，一些民主党议员和像“纽约先驱论坛报”等报纸都认为，英国的决定是难以非议的。人们更多的是把视线转向美国对华政策本身。华盛顿发行量最大的晚报“明星报”昨天说，“在过去一段时间内，美国政策的价值就值得怀疑。现在这种政策作为向北京施加压力的手段已经完全失效了。”
    这家报纸说，美国坚持的完全“禁运”政策“现在只不过是在全世界根本不愿意僵持的时候想使全世界同中国共产党人僵持的一种无效的努力罢了”。它主张“彻底重新估价”美国政府对亚洲的看法。
    华盛顿第二家发行最大的晚报“华盛顿每日新闻”刊载驻伦敦记者的一篇文章说，欧洲“盟国”几乎一致反对美国的对华政策，欧洲国家认为美国支持蒋介石集团是“毫无价值”的事。
    据路透社报道，美国国会里许多人说，现在不能责备英国“单独干”。现在的问题是：由于预料其他许多盟国也将效法英国的做法，美国自己究竟是否能够“单独干”而继续执行它目前的对华政策。
