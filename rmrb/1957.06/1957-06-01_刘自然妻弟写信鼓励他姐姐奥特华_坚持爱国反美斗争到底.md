    (Our newspaper, Changsha, May 31st dispatch) Liu Ziran's brother-in-law, Jing Liang (also known as Vienna), who is currently in Changsha, went to the editorial department of the New Hunan Daily on the morning of May 31st to denounce the American military's atrocities in killing his brother-in-law, Liu Ziran. That afternoon, he wrote a letter to his sister, Ottowa, encouraging her to persist in the patriotic, anti-American struggle.

    In his letter, Jing Liang said: "When I saw the photo of you standing before brother-in-law's portrait, my eyes suddenly blurred, and tears of sorrow and anger couldn't help but burst forth. We must make the American aggressors repay this blood debt with blood.

    Sister, how courageous you are! How strong! You are truly worthy of being a good descendant of the Yellow Emperor! You resolutely rejected the enticement of Dong Xianguang, that running dog, and resolutely protested and struggled against American imperialism. You did well! You did right! Look, all the people of Taiwan, all the people of the nation, and even the people of the world are standing by your side." He hoped that Ottowa would persist in the struggle until Taiwan is liberated from under the iron heel of the American aggressors and returns to the embrace of the motherland.

    In this letter, Jing Liang reported to his sister about the situation at home. Jing Liang now works as a laboratory technician at the Hunan Coal Construction Materials Company and is a member of the Communist Youth League. His younger sister is a skilled lathe operator at the Changsha Machine Tool Factory. He has received the glorious title of "Activist in Building Socialism." His sister is a model student. Their income is more than enough to support the whole family, and they are living well. Their mother, who is over sixty years old, is in good health but constantly longs for her relatives in Taiwan. Jing Liang said in his letter: "Now we are saving all the money we don't spend each month, and when you come back, we will buy you a set of 'weapons' – drawing tools – to expose and bombard those evil American aggressors."

    Jing Liang finally encouraged his sister to be strong, never compromise with the American aggressors! Never be subject to any of their enticements or deceptions, unite closely with the people of the whole country and the people of Taiwan, and resolutely drive the American aggressors completely out of Taiwan, so that Taiwan can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 31st dispatch) Xinhua News Agency reporters today visited Mo Ying, the mother-in-law of Liu Ziran, who was killed by the American military. She told reporters: "I protest the American aggressors' unprovoked killing of my son-in-law! I hate the Chiang Kai-shek clique for failing to protect Chinese compatriots in Taiwan! I hope that Taiwan will be liberated from the occupation of the American aggressors immediately! I now hope to see my eldest daughter immediately; to cry together and comfort her wounded heart."

    Mo Ying also said that she misses her eldest daughter, Ottowa, very much, and she is proud of her daughter's courage and national integrity in this struggle. She said that Ottowa had a talent for painting since she was a child, and held an art exhibition in Nanjing when she was in elementary school, and later studied at the Hangzhou Art College. Later, she went to Taiwan, but in Taiwan, her painting talent was not developed, and she only repaired photos for a photography studio. She hopes that her daughter can return to the mainland and reunite with her family.

    刘自然妻弟写信鼓励他姐姐奥特华
    坚持爱国反美斗争到底
    本报长沙31日电　现在长沙的刘自然的妻弟荆良（又名维也纳），5月31日上午到新湖南报编辑部控诉美军杀害他姐夫刘自然的暴行。当天下午，他写了一封信给他的姐姐奥特华，鼓励她坚持爱国反美斗争。
    荆良在信中说：“当我看到你站在姐夫遗像前的照片时，眼睛忽然模糊起来，伤心和愤怒的眼泪不由得夺眶而出。这血债我们一定要美国侵略者以血来偿还。
    姐姐，你是多么有勇气！多么坚强！你真不愧为黄帝的好子孙！你坚决拒绝了董显光这个狗奴才的引诱，坚决向美帝国主义抗议、斗争，你干得好！干得对！你看，全台湾人民、全国人民、甚至全世界人民都站在你这一边。”他希望奥特华坚持斗争下去，直到台湾从美国侵略者铁蹄下解放出来，回到祖国怀抱里为止。
    荆良在这封信里，向他姐姐报告了家中的情况。荆良现在湖南煤建器材公司任化验员，是共青团员。妹妹是长沙机床厂熟练的车工。他得到过建设社会主义积极分子的光荣称号。妹妹是学习模范。他们的收入维持全家生活足足有余，生活过得很好。他们六十多岁的母亲很健康，就是常盼望在台湾的亲人。荆良在信中说：“现在我们将每月花不完的钱都储蓄起来了，等你回来时给你购置一套‘武器’——画图用具，去揭发、去轰击那万恶的美国侵略者。”
    荆良最后鼓励他姐姐坚强起来，决不向美国侵略者妥协！决不要受他们任何引诱欺骗，与全国人民、全台湾人民紧紧团结起来，坚决把美国侵略者彻底赶出台湾，使台湾早日回到祖国怀抱。
    据新华社长沙31日电　新华社记者今天走访了被美军杀害的刘自然的岳母莫瑛，她对记者说：“我抗议美国侵略者无故杀害我的女婿！我痛恨蒋介石集团不能保护台湾的中国同胞！我希望台湾马上就从美国侵略者的霸占下解放出来！我现在希望立刻能见到我的大女儿；抱头大哭一场，来安慰她那受了创伤的心。”
    莫瑛还说，她现在很想念大女儿奥特华，她为自己的女儿能有这样的斗争勇气和民族气节感到自豪。她说，奥特华小时就有绘画天才，小学时就在南京举行过画展，以后曾在杭州艺术专科学校学习。后来她到了台湾，但在台湾她的绘画才能却得不到发展，只是给一家照像馆修照片。她希望女儿能回到大陆来，和家人团聚。
