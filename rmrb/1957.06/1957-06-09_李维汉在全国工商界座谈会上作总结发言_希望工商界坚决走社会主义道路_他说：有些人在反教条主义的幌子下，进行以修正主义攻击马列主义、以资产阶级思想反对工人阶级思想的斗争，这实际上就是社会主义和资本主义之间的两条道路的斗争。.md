Li Weihan Delivers Concluding Remarks at National Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium
Expressing Hope That Industrial and Commercial Circles Will Firmly Take the Socialist Road
He said: Some people, under the guise of opposing dogmatism, are waging a struggle of using revisionism to attack Marxism-Leninism, and using bourgeois ideology to oppose the ideology of the working class. This is actually a struggle between two roads: socialism and capitalism.
    (Reported by our newspaper) The symposium for national industrial and commercial figures convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee held its final meeting yesterday. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered concluding remarks at the meeting. He said that most of the criticisms and opinions raised at the meeting were correct and well-intentioned; a portion were incorrect, and some of the incorrect ones were of a serious nature. He pointed out: those arguments and attacks against ideological remolding, under the guise of opposing dogmatism, are waging a struggle of using revisionism to attack Marxism-Leninism, and using bourgeois ideology to oppose the ideology of the working class. This is actually a struggle between two roads: socialism and capitalism. In conclusion, he expressed his hope that the industrial and commercial circles would firmly take the socialist road, and expressed his willingness to help them smoothly pass through the transition period and become glorious laborers in socialist society.
    At the meeting, Li Zhuchen (Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce), Hu Juewen (Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association), and Chen Shutong (Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce) spoke successively. They gave extremely high praise to the great spirit of the Chinese Communist Party in opening its doors to rectification and humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, as well as the wise policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people. They sternly refuted the erroneous ideas of some people who attempted to deviate from socialism and negate the leadership of the working class. Li Zhuchen said frankly, "The democratic parties and the Communist Party can only coexist in the long term if they are of one heart and mind and take one road. If people have different hearts and minds and take different roads, long-term coexistence is impossible." Hu Juewen believed that some of Zhang Naiqi's recent arguments were wrong and not beneficial to the industrial and commercial circles. Chen Shutong pointed out in his speech that some of Zhang Naiqi's strange arguments were typical of the prominence of bourgeois ideology. (The speeches of Li Zhuchen, Hu Juewen, and Chen Shutong are on page four).
    At the meeting, Tang Diyin, Huang Changshui, and Li Kangnian made written statements. Tang Diyin reflected the difficulties of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households. Huang Changshui put forward some suggestions for improving the relationship between public and private sectors and the relationship between the Party and the masses. Li Kangnian supplemented his last speech by saying that his opinion was not to require everyone to receive the full twenty years of "redemption money," and those who wished to give it up could do so.
    Li Weihan's Concluding Remarks
    Friends, Comrades:
    Now, our symposium is coming to an end. I would like to thank the friends who actively participated in the symposium, and thank the leaders of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
      Most criticisms and opinions are
  correct and well-intentioned; a part
  is wrong, and some of the wrong part
  is serious in nature
    This symposium has its characteristics: First, from May 15th to today, twenty-five sessions have been held, and one hundred and eight people have spoken. It can be said that the meeting was quite lively and the speeches were quite thorough. Second, the participants in the symposium included friends from all aspects, including large, medium, and small types of industrialists and business people, women, young people, and agents of capitalists, as well as responsible cadres of local organizations of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, and standing committee members of the Central Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association. This has made the issues, criticisms, and opinions raised at this symposium relatively broad and better able to reflect the situation in various aspects. Third, the symposium held heated debates on certain fundamental issues, which played an important role in distinguishing right from wrong.
    This symposium should be said to have been a good one, which has greatly helped our Party's rectification campaign and will greatly help to continue the socialist transformation of industrialists and businessmen.
    Most of the criticisms and opinions raised and touched upon at the symposium are correct and well-intentioned; a portion are incorrect, and some of the incorrect ones are of a serious nature.
    We are willing to seriously accept the correct criticisms and opinions, strive to overcome the shortcomings of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and improve our work.
      Issues related to small and medium-sized industrialists and
  businessmen and agents of capitalists, etc., have been
  handed over to a special group for research
    The symposium discussed issues related to small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen and agents of capitalists. Both of these types of issues are very important and should be addressed appropriately. Because they involve many aspects, especially the situation of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen is particularly complex, and many practical difficulties will be encountered in handling them, which require careful study. At this symposium, it was not possible to obtain a consensus and concrete answers. We have asked a special group to study them carefully, hoping that they can propose reasonable and feasible suggestions for consideration by the relevant government departments. Before the government makes a decision, it will, as in the past, exchange views with the leaders of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    The symposium mentioned the work of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce after the upsurge of socialist transformation, the division of labor and cooperation between the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the working relationship between the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. These issues have also been submitted to a special group for research, hoping to summarize experience and propose appropriate suggestions. According to the wishes of many friends at the symposium, I would like to make a statement here: Communist Party members who are currently serving as Secretary-Generals or other leadership positions in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, all those whom their respective All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations require to remain in their positions, should continue to remain in their positions, except in special circumstances where they may be transferred; at the same time, the United Front Work Department should maintain close contact with the non-Party Secretary-Generals and other non-Party leading cadres and take a positive attitude towards helping them. As for the relationship between the CPC and the China Democratic National Construction Association, I have generally discussed it at the symposium of democratic parties and non-party democratic persons, and I will not repeat it here.
    The system of public representatives is a fundamental system, and its task is to ensure the socialist direction and the leadership of the state
    The speeches at the symposium almost all touched on the issue of the relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures. Indeed, this is a key issue in joint ventures. This relationship, for the most part, was established after the upsurge, and it is a new relationship that has not lasted long. In addition, it involves both working relationships and class relationships, so it is not only new, but also relatively complex, and it is indeed not easy to handle well. This relationship has its own process of occurrence, development, and elimination, from the relationship of labor-capital antagonism in private enterprises, through this dual relationship, and gradually transitioning to a completely cooperative and mutually supportive relationship. This process of change requires a considerable amount of time and the joint efforts of both the public and private sectors to achieve. At present, there are indeed many problems in the relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures, but as many friends have said, most of them are gradually progressing. We believe that in the future, it will continue to progress, on the one hand, because private personnel are generally patriotic and many are willing to serve socialism; on the other hand, the shortcomings and mistakes of some public personnel in terms of understanding and style will definitely be improved after the rectification campaign, and the relevant leading departments of the Party and the government will of course make more efforts to improve this aspect of the work. The system of public representatives in joint ventures is a fundamental system, and its task is to ensure the socialist direction and the leadership of the state. In order to achieve this task, public personnel must be responsible for managing the relationship between the public and private sectors well. Public personnel should have sufficient understanding and assessment of the changes and progress of private personnel since the upsurge. For all patriotic private personnel who are willing to serve socialism, they should be given full trust, so that they have duties, powers, and responsibilities, and support and help them to do their work well. Those with technical expertise should be given the opportunity to use their expertise in technical positions as much as possible, and continue to improve. Their rationalization proposals must be fully supported. They should be encouraged and criticized: if they have achievements and progress, they should be appropriately encouraged; if they have shortcomings and errors, they should be appropriately criticized from the desire for unity, and enlightened to consciously correct them. We must earnestly learn from their strengths and earnestly help them solve all the problems that need to be solved.
    Private personnel must complete the dual task of participating in socialist construction and self-transformation through labor practice
    The issues and opinions raised at the symposium in this regard have been submitted to a special group for research. It is hoped that they can summarize experience and develop some methods for managing the relationship between the public and private sectors well. Naturally, on the issue of the relationship between the public and private sectors, we must also invite public personnel and employee representatives to exchange views, which needs to be declared to everyone.
    For private personnel, we hope that they will be determined to take root in enterprise work. With this determination, they will strive to improve the relationship between the public and private sectors and strive to do a good job in enterprise work from their own side. Facing them is the dual task of participating in socialist construction and self-transformation, and to complete this dual task, they must take the enterprise as the base, give full play to their active role in labor practice, in working with employees, and at the same time transform their own thinking and style.
    The contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie still exist, and class struggle still exists, and under certain conditions, it will still be quite intense. But this is a contradiction among the people
    After the upsurge, fundamental changes have taken place in the relations of production in urban and rural areas of our country. Capitalists have begun to separate from the means of production in enterprises, thereby creating extremely favorable conditions for the further transformation of bourgeois elements. However, capitalist ownership has not been completely changed, exploitation still exists, and the bourgeoisie still exists. Although the large-scale mass class struggle has ended, the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie still exist, and class struggle still exists, and under certain conditions, it will still be quite intense. Because the bourgeoisie still exists, and bourgeois elements are in the process of changing from exploiters to laborers, the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois elements still exists; of course, the appearance of the two-sidedness has changed somewhat, and is already different from the past. In order to correctly handle the class contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie in accordance with the principles of handling contradictions among the people (not to mention the distant past, everyone should be very familiar with the fact that we have always treated the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie as contradictions among the people since the founding of the country), in order to promote the transformation of bourgeois elements into working people, I think it is entirely necessary for friends to advocate strengthening the ideological remolding work of bourgeois elements. Of course, in the ideological remolding work, we must affirm the positive side of the bourgeois elements and encourage them to continue to move forward; and for their negative side, we must adhere to the method of "unity-criticism-unity," actively help them to correct, but do not take a rude attitude.
    Some people are waging a struggle of attacking Marxism-Leninism and opposing the working class under the guise of opposing dogmatism
    Some people oppose ideological remolding, asserting that: bourgeois elements no longer exploit, and their fixed interest is not exploitation; there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and workers, that is, there is no class difference; the bourgeoisie no longer has class two-sidedness, just like the working class, there is only the two-sidedness of advanced and backward; bourgeois elements can love socialism without transformation; bourgeois elements absolutely do not need "radical transformation" of essence. And so on. These people attack the views and ideas that are contrary to their arguments as dogmatism, metaphysics, and the theory of class composition. This kind of argument is "helping the industrial and commercial circles by doing them a disservice," and is very unfavorable to the industrial and commercial circles. It is no accident that this kind of argument has been criticized by many friends at our symposium. This kind of argument and attack, under the guise of opposing dogmatism, is waging a struggle of using revisionism to attack Marxism-Leninism, and using bourgeois ideology to oppose the ideology of the working class. This is actually a struggle between two roads: socialism and capitalism.
    We are willing to help the industrial and commercial circles smoothly pass through the transition period and become glorious laborers in socialist society
    We are very pleased to see that through several years of education and transformation, the industrial and commercial circles have made great progress. The number of progressive elements among them has gradually increased, and most of the people in the intermediate and backward states are also gradually changing in the direction of progress. Progressive elements must continue to seek progress and stand the test; at the same time, they must unite with the intermediate elements to move forward, and work with them to work with the backward elements. For the progressive elements in the industrial and commercial circles to be able to play a leading and backbone role in this way, they need to strive to overcome the sectarianism of being divorced from the majority. In the work of helping the industrial and commercial circles to unite and make progress, we have contributed a little, and in the future we will continue to work with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association to further do this aspect of the work well. We hope and are willing to help the industrial and commercial circles smoothly pass through the transition period and become glorious laborers in socialist society.
    Firmly take the socialist road, friends!

    李维汉在全国工商界座谈会上作总结发言
    希望工商界坚决走社会主义道路
    他说：有些人在反教条主义的幌子下，进行以修正主义攻击马列主义、以资产阶级思想反对工人阶级思想的斗争，这实际上就是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争。
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部召开的全国工商界人士座谈会，昨日举行了最后一次会议。中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉在会上作了总结性的发言。他说，会上提出的批评和意见，大多数是正确的、善意的；有一部分是错误的，其中一部分错误的性质是严重的。他指出：那些反对思想改造的论调和攻击，是在反对教条主义的幌子下，进行以修正主义攻击马列主义、以资产阶级思想反对工人阶级思想的斗争，这实际上就是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争。最后，他希望工商界坚决地走社会主义道路，并且表示愿意帮助工商界平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，变成社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者。
    会上，李烛尘（中国民主建国会副主任委员、全国工商业联合会副主任委员）、胡厥文（中国民主建国会副主任委员）、陈叔通（全国工商业联合会主任委员）先后发言。他们对中国共产党开门整风，虚心听取群众意见的伟大精神，以及正确处理人民内部矛盾的英明方针，予以极高的估价。对于某些人企图离开社会主义，否定工人阶级领导的错误思想，给予严厉的驳斥。李烛尘很坦率地说，“民主党派同共产党只有一条心，走一条路才能长期共存，如果人各一心，各走各路，是不可能长期共存的”。胡厥文认为，章乃器最近期的一些论调是错误的，对工商界是没有好处的。陈叔通在发言中指出，章乃器的一些怪论是资产阶级思想突出的典型。（李烛尘、胡厥文、陈叔通三人的发言见第四版）
    会上，汤蒂因、黄长水、李康年三人作了书面发言。汤蒂因反映工商界中小户的困难。黄长水对改进公私关系、党群关系提出了一些建议。李康年补充他上一次的发言说，他的意见并不是要大家必须领足二十年的“赎金”，愿意放弃的人可以放弃。李维汉的总结发言朋友们、同志们：
    现在，我们的座谈会要结束了，我谨向积极参加座谈会的朋友们致谢，向民建会和全国工商联的领导者致谢。
      大多数批评和意见是
  正确的，善意的；有一部
  分是错误的，其中一部分
  错误的性质是严重的
    这个座谈会有它的特点：第一，从5月15日起到今天举行了二十五次座谈，讲了话的有一百零八位，可以说：会开得相当热烈，话讲得相当充分。第二，参加座谈会的包含了各方面的朋友，有大、中、小各个类型和妇女、青年、资方代理人等等工商业者，有工商联、民建会地方组织的负责干部，有全国工商联和民建会中央的常务委员，这就使得这个座谈会上提出的问题、批评和意见比较广泛，比较能够反映各方面的情况。第三，座谈会在某些带根本性的问题上展开了热烈的辩论，对明辨是非起了重要作用。
    这个座谈会应当说是开得好的，对于我们党的整风有很大帮助，对于继续贯彻工商业者的社会主义改造也有很大帮助。
    座谈会上提出和接触到的批评和意见，大多数是正确的，是善意的；有一部分是错误的，其中一部分错误的性质是严重的。
    对于正确的批评和意见，我们愿意认真接受，努力克服主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的毛病，改进工作。
      有关中小工商业者和
  资方代理人的问题等，已
  交专门小组研究
    座谈会上谈到了有关中小工商业者和资方代理人的问题。这两类问题都很重要，应当寻求适当的处理办法。由于它们关涉到的方面很多，中小工商业者问题的情况尤为复杂，处理起来会遇到许多的实际困难，需要很好地加以研究。在这次座谈会上，还不可能求得一致的意见和具体的答案。我们已请专门小组仔细加以研究，希望他们能够提出合理的、行得通的建议，提请政府有关部门考虑处理。在政府作出决定以前，会像过去一样，同民建会和全国工商联的领导人员交换意见。
    座谈会上提到社会主义改造高潮以后工商联的工作问题、工商联和民建会间的分工合作问题以及工商联同中共统战部的工作关系问题。这些问题，也交请专门小组加以研究，希望能够总结经验，提出适当的建议。根据座谈会上许多朋友的希望，我在这里作个声明：现在在工商联担任正副秘书长或者其他领导职务的共产党员，凡属他们所在的工商联组织要求他们留在里面工作的，除特殊情况外，都要继续留在里面工作下去，个别不适当的可以调换；统战部应当同时和非党的正副秘书长和其他非党的领导干部密切联系，并对他们采取积极帮助的态度。至于中共同民建会的关系问题，我在各民主党派、无党派民主人士座谈会上一般地已经谈过，这里不加重复了。
    公方代表制度是一项根本的制度，它的任务是保证企业的社会主义方向和国家的领导
    座谈会上的发言差不多都讲到了合营企业的公私共事关系问题。的确，这是合营企业中的一个关键问题。这种关系，大多数是在高潮以后才建立起来的，是一种历时不久的新的关系，加以其中有工作关系，又有阶级关系，因此不仅是新，而且比较复杂，要处理得好，确实是不容易的。这种关系有它的发生、发展和消灭的过程，从私营企业的劳资对立的关系，经过这种两重性关系，逐步过渡到完全的合作互助关系。这个变化过程需要相当长的时间，需要公私双方的共同努力，才能实现。现在，合营企业的公私共事关系确实存在着不少问题，同时也如同许多朋友讲过的，多数是在逐渐进步。我们认为今后还会继续进步，这一方面是因为私方人员一般是爱国的，不少人是愿意为社会主义服务的；另一方面，一部分公方人员在认识上和作风上的缺点，错误，经过整风，一定会有所改进，而党和政府的有关领导部门当然要更多地努力来改进这方面的工作。合营企业的公方代表制度是一项根本的制度，它的任务是保证企业的社会主义方向和国家的领导。而要实现这个任务，公方人员就必须负责搞好公私共事关系。公方人员对于高潮以来私方人员的变化和进步，应当有足够的认识和估计。对于一切爱国的、愿意为社会主义服务的私方人员，应当充分给以信任，使他们有职有权有责，支持和帮助他们做好工作。有技术专长的，应当尽可能使他们在技术岗位上发挥所长，并且继续提高。对他们的合理化建议，必须充分给以支持。对他们要有鼓励有批评：他们有成绩和进步，应当适当鼓励；他们有缺点和错误，应当从团结的愿望出发，适当批评，启发他们自觉地加以改正。要认真地学习他们的长处，认真地帮助他们解决一切需要解决的问题。
    私方人员要通过劳动实践，完成参加社会主义建设和自我改造的双重任务
    座谈会上就这方面所提出的问题和意见，已交请专门小组进行研究。希望他们能够总结经验，拟出一些关于搞好公私共事关系的办法来。自然，关于公私共事关系的问题，我们还必须邀请公方人员和职工代表交换意见，这是需要向大家声明的。
    对于私方人员，我们希望他们下定决心在企业工作中扎下根来。有了这个决心，就会从自己这一方面去努力改进公私共事关系和努力搞好企业里的工作。在他们面前，摆着参加社会主义建设和自我改造的双重任务，而要完成这双重任务，他们必须以企业为基地，在劳动实践中，在同职工一道工作中，发挥自己的积极作用，同时改造自己的思想和作风。
    工人阶级和资产阶级间的矛盾还存在，阶级斗争也还存在，在一定条件下，还会表现得相当激烈。但这是人民内部矛盾
    高潮以后，我国的城乡生产关系发生了根本变化，资本家同企业里的生产资料开始分离，从而为资产阶级分子的进一步改造创造了极为有利的条件。但是资本家所有制还没有完全改变，剥削还存在，资产阶级还存在。大规模的群众性的阶级斗争虽然已经结束，但是工人阶级和资产阶级间的矛盾还存在，阶级斗争也还存在，在一定条件下，还会表现得相当激烈。由于资产阶级还存在，资产阶级分子正处在由剥削者改变为劳动者的过程中，资产阶级和资产阶级分子的两面性也就还存在；当然两面性的面貌已经有所改变，已经和过去有所不同。为了按照处理人民内部矛盾的原则正确地处理工人阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级矛盾（远的不说，建国以来，大家应当很熟悉我们一直是把工人阶级和民族资产阶级间的矛盾当作人民内部矛盾来处理的），为了促进资产阶级分子向劳动人民的转化，我认为朋友们主张加强对资产阶级分子的思想改造工作，是完全必要的。当然，在思想改造工作中，必须肯定资产阶级分子的积极一面，鼓励他们继续前进；而对他们的消极一面，必须坚持“团结—批评—团结”的方法，积极帮助他们改正，但是不要采取粗暴的态度。
    有人在反对教条主义的幌子下进行攻击马列主义、反对工人阶级的斗争
    有人反对思想改造，断言：资产阶级分子已经没有剥削，他们拿定息也不是剥削；资产阶级分子和工人之间已经没有本质的区别，就是说已经没有了阶级区别；资产阶级已经没有了阶级两面性，如同工人阶级一样，只有先进和落后的两面性；资产阶级分子不经过改造也能爱社会主义；资产阶级分子决不需要“脱胎换骨”的本质的改造。等等。这些人把同自己的论调相反的观点和思想，都当作教条主义、形而上学、唯成分论，加以攻击。这种论调是在给工商界“帮倒忙”，是对工商界很不利的。在我们的座谈会上，这种论调受到不少朋友的批驳，不是偶然的。这种论调和攻击，是在反教条主义的幌子下，进行以修正主义攻击马列主义、以资产阶级思想反对工人阶级思想的斗争，这实际上就是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争。
    我们愿意帮助工商界平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，变成社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者
    我们很高兴地看到，经过几年来的教育改造，工商界有很大的进步，他们中的进步分子逐渐增多起来，处于中间和落后状态的人们，大多数也在逐渐向进步的方向变化。进步分子必须继续求进步，经得起考验；同时，很好地团结中间分子一道前进，并且同他们一道去向落后分子进行工作。工商界的进步分子要能够这样地发挥带头、骨干作用，就需要努力克服脱离多数的宗派主义的毛病。在帮助工商界团结和进步的工作上，我们曾经贡献过一点力量，今后仍然要同工商联、民建会一道，进一步做好这一方面的工作。我们希望并且愿意帮助工商界平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，变成社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者。
    坚决地走社会主义道路吧，朋友们！
