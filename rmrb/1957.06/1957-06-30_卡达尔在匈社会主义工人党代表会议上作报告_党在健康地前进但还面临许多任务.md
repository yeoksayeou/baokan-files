Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 29th: Kadar delivered a report on the political situation and the tasks of the party on behalf of the Provisional Central Committee at the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party National Congress on June 27th.

　　Kadar first briefly described the heroic struggle history of the party, and then analyzed the party's political leadership during the period of 1949-1953. He said that the achievements of the party's activities during this period were enormous, but at the same time, some phenomena of being detached from the masses also appeared.

　　Kadar pointed out that in June 1953, the Party Central Committee (not the Nagy group) exposed the mistakes made by the party in practice and correctly formulated measures to correct the mistakes. However, in the implementation, Nagy was mistakenly allowed to assume a particularly important role, and some comrades headed by Rakosi were also unable to get rid of past mistakes in time. Therefore, the party's policy vacillation during the period from June 1953 to July 1956 caused a certain degree of unrest in public opinion. Thus, in the spring of 1956, party members and the majority of the working people developed reasonable dissatisfaction. Domestic and foreign enemies took advantage of this dissatisfaction to oppose us.

　　Kadar said that the Party Central Committee made important and correct resolutions in July 1956, which created conditions for correcting mistakes. Party members and non-party people welcomed and supported the July resolutions. Although the revisionists of the Nagy clique also said they would work hard to correct the mistakes, they did not support the July resolutions, but turned to the enemy's camp to assist the armed counter-revolution. The Nagy elements had already fallen to the counter-revolutionary camp in advance, and after they entered the party's leadership, they used and organized external forces to realize their betrayal program. During the period from October 23 to November 4, the socialist revolutionary forces in Hungary were still greater than the counter-revolutionary forces, but the counter-revolutionary forces were organized and penetrated the leadership, while the socialist revolutionary forces were not organized, and traitors were mixed in the leadership.

　　Kadar said that the policy of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government established on November 4 and the reorganized Socialist Workers' Party at that time was not to compromise with the enemy or negotiate with the traitors. At present, the past leaders of the party who committed dogmatic and sectarian errors do not have positions in the party's leading organs, in order to avoid sectarianism in the party again. Kadar said that the Party Central Committee's policy was produced in a very difficult situation. We have made great achievements, basically restored the national economy, restored cultural education and scientific activities, reorganized the party, and established the Communist Youth League. The party is healthy and active, but there are still many tasks waiting to be solved. A sense of complacency has emerged in the party, which is the most dangerous thing at present.

　　Subsequently, Kadar criticized the unprincipled quarrels and debates among some comrades, hoping that everyone would learn the lessons from the revisionist compromise, betrayal of the class, sectarianism, and detachment from the masses.

　　Kadar said that strengthening the regime based on the alliance of workers and peasants is our important task. We must resolutely fight against counter-revolution, and the working class and the entire people must continue to be vigilant. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate the remnants of revisionist views existing in the party and the remnants of the compromise policy resulting therefrom; to suppress class enemies, but not to equate the deceived people with the enemies, and to give these people help so that they can embark on the correct path.

　　Kadar emphasized the importance of attaching importance to mass organization work. He said that strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat requires winning over the masses and using the activities of festivals and party days to publicize the party's policies. We now have only 350,000 party members. If we do not win the support of the party from mass organizations, the party cannot fight. Kadar also pointed out that the Patriotic People's Front must be strengthened. He said that this work has very favorable conditions. Under the influence of the counter-revolutionary offensive, not only communists but also non-party people and even people educated by other parties have awakened. After November 4, we really need a strong and broad Patriotic People's Front. Now, the central and local authorities must actively attract members of the Patriotic People's Front to solve regular tasks.

　　When talking about industrial and agricultural production, Kadar said that at present, the entire industrial production has reached 94.95% of what it was before the October events last year, labor productivity is 5% lower than before the October events last year, and the actual value of wages has increased by 15%. Agricultural issues are more complicated. The land has been sown, the climate is also very good, and a good harvest is expected, but the sown area of grain has been reduced, and the sown area of corn and other feed has increased. We should increase grain production without expanding the sown area, and we cannot expect foreign countries to guarantee bread.

　　Kadar said that the most important issue in agriculture at present is to develop production and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is correct to give preferential treatment and help to individual farmers, but it is wrong that production cooperatives have not received the necessary help. It is necessary to enable some production cooperatives, cooperative groups, and some special labor combinations to achieve greater economic results. After a period of transitional stagnation, there is hope that a surge in the cooperative movement will occur in two or three years by means of persuasion.

　　When talking about the importance of centralized state leadership, Kadar criticized the erroneous view that centralized leadership would hinder the development of various undertakings. He said that we should overcome some excessive phenomena of over-centralization, develop local independence, but at the same time we should also overcome the tendencies of anarchism and bureaucracy.

　　Regarding the workers' committees, Kadar said that the workers' committees did not perform well in the past, and were used to serve the counter-revolution in the early stage. At present, the most important thing is to expand workers' supervision in factories and ensure that direct representatives of workers implement workers' supervision in production. Of course, this supervision cannot weaken the central leadership and cannot abolish the authority of the factory director. Since trade unions have a history of seventy or eighty years in Hungary, the party should make these workers' supervisory bodies work under the centralized leadership of the trade unions.

　　When talking about the issue of scientific and cultural life, Kadar pointed out that the central issue is the relationship between the party and intellectuals. If we adjust this relationship well, the problems in cultural life can also be solved. During the counter-revolutionary riots, some intellectuals were guilty and should be helped to return to the correct path; some were always loyal to the socialist revolution even in the most serious moments. We should treat intellectuals differently. In the past seven months, some intellectuals have been passive, some have always been against us, but most have participated in the restoration work.

　　Kadar also talked about strengthening youth work.

　　Kadar then talked about the party's internationalist obligations, the unity of the socialist camp, and the Warsaw Pact. He said that the primary issue in the close unity of the socialist camp is our relationship with the Soviet Union and the fraternal relations between socialist countries. We have a very clear understanding of this during and after the counter-revolutionary riots were crushed. The enemy vainly attempted to use the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident to undermine the unity of the international proletariat. But the opposite is true, our unity has been further consolidated in this struggle. Kadar said that it cannot be denied that in the past year and a half, there have been difficulties in our party and even in the international workers' movement, but now it can be seen that the difficulties have been overcome, and therefore, unity has been further strengthened.

　　Kadar finally said that we have all the conditions to strengthen our party. But we cannot be complacent, we cannot forget the crimes committed against us by the enemy and the traitors, nor can we forget the mistakes we ourselves have made.

　　卡达尔在匈社会主义工人党代表会议上作报告
    党在健康地前进但还面临许多任务
    新华社布达佩斯29日电　卡达尔6月27日在匈牙利社会主义工人党全国代表会议上，作了临时中央委员会关于政治局势和党的任务的报告。
    卡达尔首先扼要地叙述了党的英勇斗争史，然后又分析了1949——1953年期间党的政治领导。他说，党在这一时期的活动的成就是巨大的，但同时也出现了一些脱离群众的现象。
    卡达尔指出，1953年6月，党中央（不是纳吉集团）揭露了党在实践中所犯的错误，并且正确地拟定了纠正错误的措施。但是，在执行中却错误地让纳吉担负了特别重要的角色，以拉科西为首的一些同志也没有能够及时摆脱过去的错误。因此，在1953年6月到1956年7月这个时期党在政策上的摇摆，在舆论中造成了一定程度的动荡，这样，在1956年春天，党员群众和大部分劳动人民产生了合理的不满情绪。国内外的敌人却利用了这种不满情绪来反对我们。
    卡达尔说，党中央在1956年7月作了重要而正确的决议，这些决议为纠正错误创造了条件。党员和党外人士是欢迎和支持7月决议的。虽然纳吉之流的修正主义者们也说努力纠正错误，但是却不支持7月决议，反而转入敌人的阵营协助武装反革命。纳吉分子已经事先倒向反革命阵营，等到他们进入党的领导机构以后，就利用并且组织外部势力来实现自己的叛变纲领。在10月23日到11月4日这个期间，匈牙利社会主义革命力量还是大于反革命力量，只不过反革命势力是有组织的，并且钻进了领导，社会主义革命力量却没有组织，而且领导内混进了叛徒。
    卡达尔说，11月4日成立的工农革命政府和经过改组后的社会主义工人党当时的政策是不同敌人妥协，不同叛徒谈判。目前，在党的领导机构中没有过去党的某些犯有教条主义和宗派主义错误的领导人的位置，这是为了避免党内再产生宗派主义。卡达尔说，党中央的政策方针是在非常困难的形势中产生的。我们已经取得了巨大的成就，基本上恢复了国民经济，恢复了文化教育和科学活动，重新组织了党，建立了共产主义青年团。党是健康的、积极的，但是还有许多任务等待解决。在党内出现了一种自满情绪，这是目前最危险的东西。
    随后，卡达尔指责了某些同志间的无原则的争吵和争论，希望大家记取修正主义妥协、出卖阶级、宗派主义、脱离群众所产生的教训。
    卡达尔说，加强以工农联盟为基础的政权是我们的重要任务，要对反革命进行坚决的斗争，工人阶级和全体人民要继续保持警惕。同时，还要消除党内存在着的修正主义观点的残余和由此而产生的妥协政策的残余；要镇压阶级敌人，但是不能把受骗的人同敌人同等看待，要对这些人给予帮助，使他们走上正确的道路。
    卡达尔强调了重视群众组织工作的重要性，他说，加强无产阶级专政需要争取群众，利用节日和党日的活动宣传党的政策。我们现在只有三十五万党员，如果不争取到群众组织对党的拥护，党就不能进行战斗。卡达尔还指出必须加强爱国人民阵线。他说这个工作是有很有利的条件的。在反革命进攻的影响下，不仅共产党人而且党外人士甚至由其他党派教育出来的人也醒悟起来了。11月4日以后我们的确需要一个坚强的广泛的爱国人民阵线。现在中央地方都要积极地吸引爱国人民阵线的成员来解决经常性的任务。
    在谈到工农业生产的时候，卡达尔说，目前，整个工业生产已经达到去年十月事件以前的94.95％，劳动生产率比去年十月事件前低5％，工资的实际价值提高了15％。农业问题比较复杂，土地是播种了，气候也很好，丰收可望，但是粮食的播种面积却减少了，玉蜀黍和其他饲料的播种面积增加了。应该在不扩大播种面积的情况下增加粮食的产量，而不能指望由外国来保证面包。
    卡达尔说，目前农业的最重要的问题是发展生产和促进农业的社会主义改造。给个体农民优待和帮助是正确的，但是生产合作社没有得到必要的帮助是不对的。要使一些生产合作社、合作小组和一些特殊的劳动组合取得更大的经济成绩。在经过一段过渡性的停滞以后，利用说服工作，有希望在两、三年后出现合作化运动的高涨。
    在谈到国家集中领导的重要性时，卡达尔批判了认为集中领导会阻碍各项事业发展的错误观点。他说，应当克服某些过分的中央集权的现象，发展地方的独立性，但是同时还应当克服无政府状态和官僚主义的倾向。
    关于工人委员会，卡达尔说，工人委员会过去表现并不好，在开始时期就被利用来为反革命服务。目前，最重要的是在工厂中扩大工人的监督，保证工人的直接代表在生产中执行工人监督，当然，这种监督不能削弱中央的领导，不能取消厂长的权限。由于工会在匈牙利已有七、八十年的历史，党应该使这些工人监督的机构在工会的集中领导下工作。
    在谈到科学文化生活的问题时，卡达尔指出，中心问题是党同知识分子的关系问题。如果我们把这种关系调整好了，文化生活中的问题也是可以解决的。在反革命暴乱中，有些知识分子是有罪过的，应当帮助他们回到正确的道路上来；有些是即使在最严重的时刻也是始终忠实于社会主义革命的，我们对待知识分子应当有所区别，在过去七个月中，一部分知识分子是消极的，一部分一直是反对我们的，但是大部分都参加了恢复工作。
    卡达尔还谈到加强青年工作的问题。
    卡达尔接着谈到了党的国际主义义务、社会主义阵营的团结和华沙条约等问题。他说，社会主义阵营紧密团结中的首要问题是我们同苏联的关系和社会主义国家间的兄弟关系。在反革命暴乱时期和反革命暴乱被击溃以后，我们对这一点是体会得很清楚的。敌人妄想借匈牙利反革命事件来破坏国际无产阶级的团结。但是事实正好相反，我们的团结在这一斗争中是更加巩固了。卡达尔说，不能否认，在过去一年半当中，在我们党内甚至在国际工人运动中也曾存在过困难，但是现在可以看到困难已经被克服了，因此，团结是更加加强了。
    卡达尔最后说，我们具有一切条件来加强我们的党。但是不能自满，不能忘记敌人和叛徒对我们所犯的罪恶，也不能忘记我们自己所犯过的错误。
