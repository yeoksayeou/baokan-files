Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: The German Communist Party recently held its congress. At the invitation of the German Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent Cheng Zihua, a member of the Central Committee, to attend the congress. Cheng Zihua delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress and read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Cheng Zihua's congratulatory speech stated that the German Communist Party is the conscious vanguard of the working class in West Germany. In the German people's struggle against war, against division, against re-militarization, and for the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, the German Communists have always stood at the forefront of the struggle and have made contributions.

He said: At present, the US imperialism, disregarding the German people's firm opposition, continues to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany, and frantically strengthens the aggressive forces of West German militarism and monopoly capital, attempting to make Germany return to the path of Hitler's destruction. All this seriously threatens peace in Europe and the world.

The German Communist Party's call for the realization of united action of the working class and collective action of all people's forces to oppose German militarism and monopoly capitalism, and to struggle for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, unified, and indivisible German republic, is completely just and therefore not isolated. Just as the German people warmly support our country's revolution and socialist construction, the Chinese people also warmly support the struggle of the German Communist Party and are convinced that under the leadership of the German Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, the united struggle of the German people will surely overcome many difficulties and achieve final victory.

The full text of the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is as follows:

To all comrades of the German Communist Party Congress:

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party extends warm and fraternal congratulations to the German Communist Party Congress.

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are watching with great sympathy and respect the heroic and unyielding struggle waged by the German Communist Party in a difficult and arduous environment. And congratulate you on the new progress you have made through the work of the Congress in consolidating and developing the party, strengthening the party's ties with the masses, safeguarding the vital interests of the working people, striving for the united action of the West German working class, and uniting all peaceful and democratic forces in West Germany. Congratulations on your continued new achievements in the struggle against militarism, for the peaceful reunification of Germany, and for the defense of European and world peace.

Long live the glorious German Communist Party!

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 18th: Today's "Neues Deutschland" reported that the newly elected Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its first plenary session the other day. At the meeting, a new Politburo was elected, and Max Reimann was unanimously re-elected as the First Secretary of the Central Committee.

　　中共中央代表向德共代表大会致贺
　　中国人民热烈支持德共的斗争
　　雷曼重新当选德共中央第一书记
    据新华社18日讯　德国共产党最近举行了代表大会，中国共产党中央应德国共产党邀请，派遣中央委员程子华出席了代表大会。程子华向代表大会致了贺词和宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    程子华的贺词说，德国共产党是西德工人阶级有觉悟的先锋部队。在德国人民为反对战争、反对分裂、反对重新军国主义化，要求建立独立、统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争中，德国共产党人始终是站在斗争的前列，并且作出了贡献。
    他说：目前，美帝国主义不顾德国人民的坚决反对，继续阻挠德国的和平统一，并且疯狂地加强西德军国主义和垄断资本的侵略力量，企图使德国重新走上希特勒的复灭道路。这一切，都严重地威胁着欧洲和世界的和平。
    德国共产党号召实现工人阶级的统一行动以及一切人民力量的集体行动，来反对德国军国主义和垄断资本主义，并且为建立一个和平、民主、统一而不可分割的德意志共和国而进行的斗争，是完全正义的，因而也绝不是孤立无援的。中国人民正像德国人民热烈地支持我国的革命和社会主义建设一样，也热烈地支持德国共产党的斗争，并且确信，在马克思列宁主义武装起来的德国共产党领导下，德国人民团结一致的斗争，一定能够战胜重重的困难而取得最后的胜利。
    中国共产党中央委员会贺电全文如下：
    德国共产党代表大会全体同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会向德国共产党代表大会致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国共产党和中国人民以极大的同情和尊敬注视着德国共产党在艰苦困难的环境下所进行的英勇不屈的斗争。并且祝贺你们通过大会的工作，在巩固和发展党、加强党和群众的联系、维护劳动人民的切身利益、争取西德工人阶级的统一行动和团结西德一切和平民主力量的事业中，获得新的进展。祝贺你们在反对军国主义、争取德国和平统一和保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中，不断地获得新的成就。
    光荣的德国共产党万岁！
    新华社柏林18日电　今天的“新德意志报”报道，德国共产党代表大会新选出的中央委员会日前举行了第一次全体会议，会上选出了新的政治局，并且一致重新选举马克斯·雷曼为中央委员会第一书记。
