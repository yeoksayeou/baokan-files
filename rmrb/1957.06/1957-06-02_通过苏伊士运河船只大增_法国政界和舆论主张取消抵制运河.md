Comprehensive report from our newspaper: A Cairo radio broadcast reported that on May 31st, a total of forty-six ships passed through the canal in three convoys. Two convoys were southbound from Port Said, and one convoy was northbound from Port Suez.

Before Egypt nationalized the former Suez Canal Company, the average number of ships passing through the canal daily was forty-five.

The radio station said that in the coming days, the average number of ships passing through the canal daily will reach fifty-five.

According to news from Paris: French Foreign Minister Pineau of the Mollet "caretaker cabinet," discussed the attitude towards the Suez Canal issue with leaders of major parties in the parliament, excluding the Communist Party, on May 29th. The majority of leaders supported France canceling the boycott of the canal.

French newspapers are dissatisfied with the government's continued solo boycott of the canal. "Le Monde" stated in an editorial on May 30th that France's boycott of the canal only paralyzes its own economy. The editorial continued, "Shipowners are becoming increasingly impatient. It is announced that a considerable number of French ships are currently heading north towards the canal."

"France-Soir" is also dissatisfied with the government's policy of continuing to boycott the canal, pointing out that it is extremely detrimental to France's own merchant ships if only France boycotts the canal.

    通过苏伊士运河船只大增
    法国政界和舆论主张取消抵制运河
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：开罗电台报道，5月31日共有四十六艘船只分三队通过运河。两队是从塞得港南行的，一队是从苏伊士港北行的。
    在埃及把前苏伊士运河公司收归国有以前，每天通过运河的船只平均是四十五艘。
    电台说，今后几天通过运河的船只每天平均将要达到五十五艘。
    另据巴黎消息：法国摩勒“看守内阁”的外交部长比诺，5月29日同议会中除共产党以外的各主要政党的领袖讨论对待苏伊士运河的态度问题。大多数领袖赞成法国取消对运河的抵制。
    法国报纸不满意政府继续单独抵制运河。“世界报”5月30日在社论中说，法国抵制运河只是瘫痪了本身的经济。社论接着说：“船主们越来越不耐烦了。据宣布，目前已有相当数量的法国轮船正朝北驶向运河。”
    “法兰西晚报”也不满意政府继续抵制运河的政策，它指出只有法国一国抵制运河，对于法国本国商船是极不利的。
