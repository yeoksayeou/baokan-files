    Newcomer
  "What's the crowd for? What's the crowd for?"
  "Look at the newcomer moved in by the commune!"
  "What are you discussing? What are you discussing?"
  "Township Head Wang is settling down in our commune."
  "What's everyone laughing at? What's everyone laughing at?"
  "Look, he even brought his sickle and hoe with him."
  "Why did he move here? Why did he move here?"
  "Is there even a need to ask? Let's welcome him quickly!"
              (Liu Yuan, Jiangjin, Sichuan)

    新来户
  “围着干啥？围着干啥？”
  “看社里搬来的新来户哇！”
  “议论些啥？议论些啥？”
  “王乡长要在我们社里安家。”
  “大家笑啥？大家笑啥？”
  “看他还随身带来了镰刀、锄耙。”
  “搬来为啥？搬来为啥？”
  “这还用问吗？快快欢迎吧！”
              （四川江津刘渊）
