　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Teachers and students from various universities and colleges in Beijing, as well as many workers, suburban farmers, and government cadres, today held preliminary discussions on Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

　　Employees of Beijing's various government agencies, factories, and enterprises, as well as teachers and students from universities and colleges, will spend a certain amount of time or all of their time in the coming week studying this report. They will also engage in extensive debates targeting the recent anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people's democratic dictatorship statements made by right-wing elements. This is to further understand the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's report, and at the same time, distinguish between right and wrong on many major issues in our country's current political life with the right-wing elements.

　　In recent days, the majority of teachers and students from Beijing's universities and colleges have already begun to counter various fallacies of the right-wing elements through forums, debates, and big-character posters. Many workers, suburban farmers, and government cadres have also held forums. Yesterday, they listened to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's report on the radio, and today they carefully read the full text of the report. Many people stated at today's discussion meetings: they will use this report as their weapon and, in the struggle to counter the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements, earnestly test their socialist stance and enhance their socialist awareness.

　　Today, the sales volume of various newspapers in the capital has increased. The sales volume of the People's Daily and Beijing Daily in the city alone has risen from more than 210,000 copies yesterday to more than 500,000 copies.

　　According to our newspaper, after Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published in the newspapers, students actively engaged in discussions, demanding to improve their ideological understanding during the study, learn to distinguish between right and wrong, so as to further criticize the erroneous statements of the right-wing elements.

　　Students of the Renmin University of China held forums one after another. Some students in the Archives Department said in the forum that after reading this report, they became more clear about how to identify the political standards of fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. Everyone also had a clearer understanding of the essence of the anti-socialist remarks of right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun and Zhang Naiqi. Many students also talked about some of their own personal feelings in the forum. They felt that they had grown up in a greenhouse in the past and could not clearly distinguish between right and wrong on some remarks and could not withstand tests. Therefore, they especially felt the importance of ideological and political education.

　　Lü Meixia, a student from Beijing Mining Institute, said that Chairman Mao once again brightened our eyes and gave us the criteria for distinguishing between right and wrong. In the previous stage, we were unable to distinguish some anti-socialist remarks in the school. After reading Chairman Mao's report, I began to understand.

　　Many students at Tsinghua University believe that Chairman Mao's report has great guiding significance for the current rectification movement, especially the six political criteria for distinguishing between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, which further clarified the ideological boundaries for everyone. Students believe that the socialist path and the leadership of the Party, which are emphasized in the six criteria, are very important. They said that this would be of great help to the discussion of all issues. He Jianping, an overseas Chinese student, said: After listening to Chairman Mao's report, my mood for the anti-rightist struggle became more激昂 (ji'ang - aroused). He said, I am an overseas Chinese student who returned from Indonesia, and I deeply feel the warm nurturing of the Party and the government. The Party is my most sublime慈母(cimu - loving mother).

　　Cai Qianqian, a student from the Geophysical Exploration Department of the Geological Prospecting College, said that Chairman Mao pointed out the criteria for judging the right and wrong of our words and actions, which made me clear about the boundaries between right and wrong. This article is very enlightening for us. Yang Jiagu said that after reading Chairman Mao's report, I improved my understanding. We must resolutely launch a struggle against the right-wing elements.

　　Many students at Peking University believe after reading Chairman Mao's report that this report is very helpful in analyzing and resolving the current contradictions among the people. Some students in the History Department said that this time our thinking is much clearer. Before reading this report, we were not very clear about some rights and wrongs, and we did not know what is a fragrant flower and what is a poisonous weed. Now that we have the six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao, we are much clearer and we are also confident about distinguishing the anti-socialist remarks of the right-wing elements. Some students believe that after reading this report, they have a clearer understanding of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Chairman Mao said that whether the democratic parties can exist for a long time is not determined solely by the wishes of the Communist Party, but also depends on the performance of the democratic parties themselves and whether they gain the trust of the people. This is very correct.

　　首都人民读了毛主席的报告
    反右派斗争的热情更加高涨
    新华社19日讯　北京市各高等学校的师生和许多工人、郊区农民、机关干部，今天都分别就毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告作了初步的讨论。
    北京市各机关、工厂、企业单位的职工和高等学校的师生们，将在今后一周内分别抽出一定时间或全部时间学习这个报告，并针对右派分子最近发表的反党、反社会主义、反对人民民主专政的言论展开大辩论，以进一步领会毛主席报告的精神和实质，同时同右派分子辨明我国当前政治生活中许多重大问题的大是大非。
    北京市各高等学校的多数师生，在最近几天内，已开始通过座谈会、辩论会和大字报等形式反击右派分子的各种谬论。许多工人、郊区农民和机关干部也开了座谈会。他们昨天在收音机前听了毛主席报告的广播，今天又认真阅读了报告的全文。很多人在今天的讨论会上表示：要以这个报告作为自己的武器，在反击右派分子的反动言论的斗争中，认真考验自己的社会主义立场和提高自己的社会主义觉悟。
    今天首都各报的销行量都有增加。光人民日报、北京日报在本市的销行量就由昨天的二十一万多份上升到五十万多份。
    本报讯　毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告在报纸上发表以后，学生们纷纷进行讨论，要求在学习中提高思想认识，学会分辨是非，以便进一步批判右派分子的错误言论。
    中国人民大学学生纷纷举行了座谈。档案系学生在座谈中，有些人说，看了这篇报告后，更加明确了如何辨明香花毒草的政治标准了。大家对于章伯钧、章乃器等右派分子的反社会主义言论的本质也更加清楚地认识了。许多同学在座谈中还谈到自己切身的一些感想。他们感到自己过去是在温室里长大的，对一些言论不能很好地明辨是非，经不起考验。因此他们特别感到思想政治教育工作的重要性。
    北京矿业学院学生吕美霞说，毛主席又一次擦亮了我们的眼睛，给了我们辨别是非的标准。在前一阶段，我们对学校里的一些反社会主义言论，是分辨不清的。看了毛主席的报告以后，我开始明白了。
    清华大学很多学生认为毛主席的报告对目前的整风运动指导意义很大，特别是关于辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准，使大家更进一步划清了思想界限。同学们对六条标准中着重指出的社会主义道路和党的领导这两点，认为十分重要。他们说这对一切问题的讨论会有很大的帮助。华侨学生何健平说：听完毛主席的报告后，使我对反右派斗争的心情更加激昂。他说，我是从印度尼西亚归国的华侨学生，我深深地感受到党和政府的温暖的抚养，党就是我的最崇高的慈母。
    地质勘探学院物探系学生蔡倩倩说，毛主席指出判断我们的言论和行动的是非的标准，使我明确了是非界限。这篇文章，对我们的启发很大。杨家谷说，看了毛主席的报告，使我提高了认识。我们要坚决对右派分子展开斗争。
    北京大学许多学生读了毛主席的报告后，都认为这个报告对分析和解决目前人民内部矛盾问题的帮助很大。历史系的一些同学说，这回我们的思想可明确多了。没有读这篇报告以前，我们对一些是非分辨不太清楚，不知什么是香花？什么是毒草？现在有了毛主席提出的这六条政治标准以后，就明确清楚多了，对分清右派分子反社会主义的言论也心中有数了。有的同学认为，读了这篇报告，对“长期共存、互相监督”的认识更清楚了。毛主席所说的各民主党派是否能够长期存在下去，不是单由共产党一方面的愿望作决定，还要看各民主党派自己的表现，要看他们是否取得人民的信任。这是非常正确的。
