Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch: The 1956-1957 pressing season has concluded for the 57 sugar factories and over ten thousand native sugar workshops in Guangdong Province. The total sugar output for this pressing season reached 410,000 tons, an increase of 20,000 tons compared to the previous pressing season.

The machine-made sugar output from the four major state-owned sugar factories, including Shunde, Shitou, Dongguan, and Zini, which each press over 1,000 tons daily, and 53 local state-owned sugar factories, totaled 286,000 tons, exceeding the state plan by over 1,200 tons. The output of native sugar totaled over 120,000 tons. This pressing season also increased the output of brown sugar and slab sugar compared to previous years to meet market demand.

Guangdong is one of China's sugar industry bases, with favorable natural conditions and rich experience in sugarcane cultivation and sugar production, with a sugar production history of over 1,000 years. Since liberation, many sugar factories have been newly built and expanded here, and there are currently seven large sugar factories with daily pressing capacities of 1,000 to 3,000 tons under construction; these factories will be put into production one after another before the end of next year.

    新华社广州电  广东省五十七家糖厂和上万个土糖作坊1956—1957年的榨季已经结束。本榨季糖的总产量达到四十一万吨，比上一个榨季增产两万吨。

    广东是我国的制糖工业基地之一，这里有着良好的自然条件和丰富的种蔗制糖经验，相传它的制糖历史已有一千多年了。解放几年来，这里新建和扩建了许多糖厂，目前正在兴建中的还有七个日榨一千吨到三千吨的大糖厂；到明年年底以前，这几个厂将先后投入生产。
