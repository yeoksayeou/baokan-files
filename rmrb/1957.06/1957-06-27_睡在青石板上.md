　　Sleeping on a Bluestone Slab
　　Wu Yan
    My grandmother's stories were often beautiful and moving, though sometimes they made people shed tears. But the stories my grandfather told always contained a bit of a lesson, sometimes one he'd learned himself, sometimes, perhaps, one he'd added himself.
    My grandfather once told me a story like this:
    Once upon a time, in a town, there was a wealthy man who owned two pawnshops. One day, fueled by wine, the wealthy man made a bet with a beggar: next to the desolate tombs outside the town was a large bluestone slab. If the beggar dared to brave the wind and snow and sleep on that stone slab for one night, he would give him one of his pawnshops the next morning. The beggar indeed slept on the stone slab for a night, safe and sound, and happily accepted a pawnshop from the wealthy man.
    The beggar became a pawnshop owner, naturally carefree and prosperous. He lived a comfortable and extravagant life for three years. One snowy, windy night, the old wealthy man came to make another bet with him: "If you sleep on the bluestone slab again for one night, I'll give you my other, even bigger pawnshop!"
    So, the old beggar slept on the bluestone slab again—he lay down and never got up again.
    My grandfather told this story to teach children not to be greedy. Although I am not yet qualified to be a grandfather, now, as I retell this story, I want to extract this lesson from it: we often think that problems in our methods of thinking are never as serious as problems in our ideology, but we don't know that failing to see problems from the perspective of changing and developing conditions can sometimes lead to death!

　　睡在青石板上
　　吴岩
    老祖母讲的故事常常是美丽动人的，虽然有时候叫人跟着掉眼泪。而老祖父讲的那些故事里，总包含着一点儿教训，有时候是他自己体会出来的，有时候，说不定是他自己添上去的。
    我的老祖父给我讲过一个这样的故事：
    从前，在一个市镇上，有个财主，开着两家当铺。一天，乘着酒兴，那个财主跟一个要饭的打了个赌：镇外荒坟旁有块大青石板，如果那要饭的敢冒着风雪在那石板上睡上一宵，第二天早晨他就把一家当铺给他。要饭的果然在石板上睡了一宵，安然无恙，于是笑嘻嘻的从财主手里接过了一家当铺。
    要饭的成了当铺老板，自然心广体胖。过了三年舒适奢侈的生活。一个风雪交加的晚上，老财主又来跟他打赌：“如果你再在大青石板上睡上一宵，我另一家更大的当铺归你！”
    于是，那老要饭的又睡到了青石板上——他睡下去了就从此再也没有起来。
    我的祖父讲这个故事，为的是要教训小孩子不要贪得无厌。我虽然还没有资格当老祖父，如今重述这个故事，却想从中抽出这样的一条教训：我们往往认为思想方法上的毛病，总不及思想意识上的毛病严重，殊不知不从条件的变化和发展看问题，有时候竟可以致人死命！
