　　Old Professors and Young Teachers Cooperate Closely
　　Zhang Yijun, Professor of Beijing Institute of Technology
    Recently, non-Party members in various colleges and universities, in helping the Party organization with rectification, have exposed problems existing in the Party's leadership work. Some people advocate abolishing the school Party committee system and implementing "professors managing the school." I disagree with this view. In today's conditions, I think the so-called professor management of the school is unfounded.
    From 1922, I began teaching at Northeastern University in Shenyang. That was the world of the feudal warlord Zhang Zuolin. The Governor of Fengtian Province, Wang Yongjiang, concurrently served as the president. Of course, there was no such thing as professors managing the school. After the September 18th Incident, I went from the Northeast to Beijing and taught at schools such as Beijing Sino-French University, Normal University, and China University. There was also no system of professor management of the school implemented. At that time, these schools were all the responsibility of the president alone. Professors, apart from teaching, did not ask about teaching administrative matters. Peking University and Tsinghua University had professor management of the school. However, according to legend, the professors there did not have much democratic rights.
    Now some people raise the issue of professor management of the school, mainly because they want to give full play to the role of old professors. In the years since liberation, the school Party committee leadership may not have paid enough attention to the role of old professors. The school Party committee leadership should attach importance to giving play to the role of old professors, but it should not be emphasized to an inappropriate degree. Qian Weichang, the vice president of Tsinghua University, told a reporter from the Beijing Daily (see Beijing Daily, May 16th) that President Jiang Nanxiang did not value old professors. I remember Jiang Nanxiang said that we should pay attention to giving play to the role of old professors, but at the same time, we should also pay attention to training young teachers. There is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps there is something else going on inside Tsinghua, which I wouldn't know. I have an immature opinion: it would be best if young scholars could get the help of old professors. But in various schools across China, there may be young people who do not get any help. Scholars like Mr. Qian are rare, and I am afraid that many of the young people in advanced studies cannot get close to them. But in my opinion, modern Chinese youth will surely make progress under the correct leadership of the Party. It is good to get the help of old professors; but under the encouragement and leadership of the Party, they will surely be able to move forward independently.
    The important issue at present is how to combine the experience of young teachers with that of old professors. In the past, because the Party leadership only valued the opinions of young teachers and there was distrust and lack of employment of old professors, old professors had concerns and opinions. I remember that in the first year or two after liberation, a professor confided in me, saying that he was afraid that the People's Government would not use him after two or three years. Although real life has answered this concern, I still hear some old professors say that the department heads in the school are all young people now, and they don't want us old folks anymore. This is an opinion about the improper use of power by the Party committee, and it is also a cry for hope of solving the problem. It is not necessary for every department head to be held by an old professor, but how can the role of old professors be brought into play? This question should be resolved in this rectification campaign.
    However, the failure of the school to fully utilize the role of old professors does not lead to the conclusion that the Party committee leadership in the school is not good, and that the Party leadership should be abolished. From my experience, the Party leadership in the school should not only not be abolished in the future, but should be strengthened. If the school does not have Party leadership, it will become anarchic. But to have Party leadership is not to replace the government with the Party and monopolize everything. For major issues concerning teaching administration, the Party committee should submit them to the school affairs committee for thorough discussion, so that the school affairs committee becomes the highest authority in the school. Our school's school affairs committee meets once or twice a year, and when it does, everyone just raises their hands, which is just a formality. That kind of meeting is not effective. I suggest that in the future, when the school Party committee holds meetings to study major issues such as teaching and scientific research, it can first invite several old gentlemen to attend the discussion and earnestly solicit everyone's opinions. When making a decision, it must be submitted to the school affairs committee for thorough discussion. The reason why the Communist Party can succeed is because it does not separate itself from the masses. And there are many Communist Party members in our school who are indeed separated from the masses, especially individual young Party members who are arrogant and domineering, and rectification is very necessary for them.
    I say that the school Party leadership should give play to the role of old professors, but whether from the current situation or especially from the future situation, the role of young teachers should not be underestimated. At present, although the teaching tasks of professional courses in our school are mainly undertaken by old professors, the teaching tasks of basic courses are borne by young teachers by 70 to 80 percent. These young teachers have been cultivated from the university graduates of 1951 to 1952. Although their knowledge is not broad enough, and some people's research is too specialized and detailed, and what they have learned is not enough to use, in general, they can explain the lectures clearly, and some individuals give very good lectures. Therefore, giving equal importance to old professors and young teachers and combining them well is the key to improving the current teaching work and scientific research work in schools, and we cannot one-sidedly go to another extreme to deal with the problem. I think the school Party committee should attach importance to this issue and implement this spirit in the specific arrangements for teaching and other work. I personally feel that the combination of old professors and young teachers in work is not only necessary, but also possible. Last year, two young teachers cooperated with me. We not only got along well in terms of personal feelings, but also helped each other in scientific research work. Because I am older and have more knowledge than them, I can give them more help; but there are also some new problems that I did not think of, but they thought of, which also helped me.
    However, the Party committee's emphasis on leadership does not mean that there are no difficulties. The thinking of intellectuals is very complex. Some old professors often consider themselves elders, are not modest, do not earnestly fulfill the obligation of cultivating young scholars, look down on young teachers, only allow young teachers to learn from themselves, teach young teachers, and are unwilling to absorb new things from the work of young teachers, and their progress is slow. To combine old professors and young teachers, the old professors must first clarify this point in their understanding.
    In the previous stage, it was right for the newspapers to expose the shortcomings of the school Party committee's failure to pay enough attention to the role of old professors in the past, but only one-sidedly emphasizing respect for old professors is also not good.
    Young teachers are in the new era under the leadership of the Communist Party. Compared with our past situation in the old society, the conditions are superior and the progress is very fast. Some people attribute their progress and achievements to individuals because they cannot see this issue from the perspective of historical development. They are proud and complacent and do not respect old professors. This is the biggest obstacle to their combination with old professors.
    Regarding these ideological problems of old professors and young teachers, I suggest that the school Party committee should solve them by strengthening ideological and political work.

### 老教授和青年教师密切合作

　　老教授和青年教师密切合作
　　北京工业学院教授  张翼军
    近来，各高等院校的党外人士，在帮助党组织整风中，揭发党在领导工作中所存在的问题，有些人主张取消学校党委制，实行“教授治校”。我不同意这种意见，在今天的条件下，我认为所谓教授治校是没有根据的。
    从1922年起，我开始在沈阳东北大学教书，那是封建军阀张作霖的天下，奉天省长王永江兼校长，当然没有什么教授治校的事情发生。九一八事变后，我由东北到北京，曾在北京中法大学、师范大学及中国大学等校教书，也没有实行过什么教授治校的制度。当时这些学校，都是由校长一人负责，教授除去教书以外，不过问什么教学行政上的事情。北京大学和清华大学搞过教授治校。但是，据传说，在那里的教授也并不是有怎样的民主权利。
    现在有些人提出教授治校这个问题，主要的理由是为了充分发挥老教授的作用。解放几年来，学校党委领导上可能有不甚重视老教授的作用的情况。学校党委领导应该重视发挥老教授的作用，但也不能把它强调到不恰当的地步。清华大学副校长钱伟长对北京日报记者说
  （见5月16日北京日报），蒋南翔校长不重视老教授。我记得蒋南翔说，要注意发挥老教授的作用，同时也要注意培养青年教师。这并没有什么不正确处。也许是在清华内部还有什么情况，那我就不得而知了。我有个不成熟的意见，大力培养青年学者，能得到老教授的帮助，那是最好的了。但是在中国各地各校可能有得不着什么帮助的青年，像钱先生那样的学者，如凤毛麟角，恐怕有很多的进修青年接近不得。但是在我看来，现代中国青年在党的正确领导下，一定能够进步。能得到老教授的帮助，固然很好；但在党的鼓舞领导下，也必能独立地前进。
    目前的重要问题，是在于青年教师与老教授的经验如何结合起来。以前，因为党的领导上只重视青年教师的意见，对老教授存在不信任和不重用的情况，老教授们是有顾虑和有意见的。我记得在解放以后一、二年内，有一个教授和我谈过心里话，他怕人民政府使用二、三年后就不使用了。这种顾虑，虽然现实生活作了回答，但是，现在我仍然听到有些老教授说，现在学校里的系主任都是小青年，不要我们上岁数的人了。这是对党委使用不当的意见，也是希望解决问题的呼声。不一定是每个系主任都要由老教授来担任，但是，怎样才能发挥老教授的作用？这个问题在这次整风中应求得解决。
    但是，学校未能充分发挥老教授的作用，并不能因此就得出结论说学校里党委领导不好，要取消党的领导。从我的经验看，今后学校党的领导不但不能取消，而且应该加强。学校假如没有党的领导，就要变成无政府状态。而要党的领导，并不是要以党代政，包办一切。有关教学行政方面的重大问题，党委应当提交校务委员会作切实的讨论，使校务委员会变成学校的最高权力机关。我们学校的校务委员会，一年开一、二次会，开时大家举举手，只有形式。那样的开法，是不起什么作用的。我建议以后校党委开会研究教学及科学研究等重大问题时，事先可以吸收几位老先生列席讨论，认真征求大家的意见。在做出某一项决定时，一定要提交校务委员会作切实的讨论。共产党所以能成事，就是因为不脱离群众。而我们学校里有不少共产党员，的确是脱离了群众，特别是个别的青年党员盛气凌人，整风对他们说是很需要的。
    我说学校党的领导要发挥老教授的作用，但不论从目前特别是从将来的情况看，都不能因此而低估青年教师的作用。目前，我们学校的专业课的教学任务，虽然是主要的还由老教授担任，而基础课程的教学任务，则有百分之七、八十靠青年教师来负担。这些青年教师，都是从1951到1952年大学毕业生中培养起来的。他们的知识虽然不够宽广，有的人因为研究得过专过细，所学不敷所用，但一般的说讲课还能讲的清清楚楚，有个别的讲得还很好。所以，把老教授和青年教师并重，并很好的结合起来，是改进当前学校教学工作和科学研究工作的关键，不能片面地走另外一个极端来处理问题。我觉得校党委应该重视这个问题，要在对教学等具体工作的安排中，贯彻这一精神。我个人亲身体会到，老教授和青年教师在工作中的结合，不仅是应该的，而且也是可能的。去年就有两个青年教师和我合作。我们不但在私人感情方面处得很好，而且，在科学研究工作方面也互有帮助。因为我年岁比较大，知识比他们多些，给他们的帮助要大些；但也有些新问题我没想到，而他们想到，对我也有帮助。
    但是，党委重视领导，并不等于说就没有困难。知识分子的思想是很复杂的。有些老教授常常以长者自居，不虚心，不认真地履行培养青年学者的义务，看不起青年教师，只许青年教师跟自己学习，教训青年教师，就不愿意从青年教师的工作中吸取新的东西，进步迟缓。要使老教授与青年教师结合，就首先要老教授在认识上弄清楚这点。
    前一阶段，报纸上揭发过去学校党委不够重视发挥老教授作用的缺点是对的，但只片面的强调尊重老教授，效果也是不好的。
    青年教师处在共产党领导的新时代，比起我们过去在旧社会的情况来说，条件是优越的，进步是非常快的。有些人因不能从历史发展的情况来看这个问题，把自己的进步和成就归功于个人，骄傲自满，不尊重老教授。这是他们同老教授结合的最大障碍。
    有关这些老教授和青年教师的思想问题，我建议校党委应该通过加强思想政治工作来加以解决。
