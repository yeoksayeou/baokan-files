　　Candy Eaters Don't Know How Expensive the Packaging Is?

　　In the market, we see candies wrapped in colorful packaging, but how could everyone know that the packaging cost of a piece of candy almost accounts for half of the cost? Let's take a look at the cost of two kinds of candies produced in Beijing: the cost of 100 catties of Soda Candy (excluding labor costs, etc.) is 153 yuan, of which the cost of wrapping paper accounts for 74 yuan and 64 cents, accounting for 48.79% of the cost; the cost of 100 catties of Cherry Blossom Candy is 136 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, of which the cost of wrapping paper is 42 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, accounting for 31% of the cost.

　　Wrapping paper accounts for half or one-third of the total cost of candy, which is not worthwhile for consumers, because people eat the candy, and the wrapping paper is thrown away after eating it; it is also a great waste to the whole society, and today's cellophane and tin foil for packaging candy still rely on imports.

　　Some people say that candy is prone to deterioration due to moisture, sanding, and rancidity, so good packaging can reduce deterioration. But the key to preventing candy from deteriorating does not lie in wrapping two more layers of paper, but in how to control temperature and humidity to strengthen protection. Besides, today's market purchasing power is very high, as long as production is planned, deterioration will not occur due to backlog.

　　Some newspapers have repeatedly put forward opinions on simplifying candy packaging, but some production units are afraid that simplifying packaging will affect sales. This idea is not without basis, but as long as the reasons are explained to consumers, and the quality of the goods has not actually declined, then sales will not be affected. ·Zhang Su Nan·

### 吃糖人哪知道包装纸有多贵？

　　吃糖人哪知道包装纸有多贵？
    在市场上，我们看到包装得五颜六色的糖果，但是大家岂能知道一块糖果的包装费几乎占到成本的一半吗？让我们看看北京市生产的两种糖果的成本吧：一百斤汽水糖成本（不包括工资等费用）是一百五十三元，其中包装纸的费用占七十四元六角四分，为成本的48.79％；一百斤樱花??糖成本是一百三十六元一角五分，其中包装纸费用为四十二元一角五分，为成本费的31％。
    包装纸要占糖果总成本的一半或三分之一，这对消费者来说是很不值得的，因为人们吃的是糖，吃完糖的包装纸随即扔掉了；对整个社会来说也不能不是一种极大的浪费，况且今天包装糖果的玻璃纸、锡纸还要依靠进口。
    有人说，糖果容易因受潮、发砂、酸败而变质，因此包装好，可以减轻变质现象。但是防止糖果变质的关键并不在于多包两层纸，而是在于如何控制温湿度来加强保护，何况今天市场购买力很高，只要生产有计划，就不会因为积压而发生变质。
    简化糖果包装问题的意见，有些报纸屡有提出，但是有些生产单位害怕包装简化以后，会影响销路。这种想法不是毫无根据的，但是只要向消费者说明原由，而且商品质量确实没有下降的话，那么销路就不致于受到影响。·张苏南·
