Glossary Explanation:

　　Early Rice, Intermediate Rice, Late Rice
　　Generally speaking, early, intermediate, and late rice are distinguished as follows:

　　Early Rice
　　Refers to rice sown in early spring, with a total growth period of less than one hundred and twenty days from sowing to harvest. Early rice is divided into double-cropping early rice and single-cropping early rice. The subsequent crop of double-cropping early rice is double-cropping late rice; the subsequent crop of single-cropping early rice is either an autumn crop in some areas, or ratooning rice in others.

    Intermediate Rice
    Refers to rice sown in spring, with a total growth period of less than one hundred and fifty days. Some areas call the earlier-growing intermediate rice "early intermediate rice." This type of intermediate rice is later than early rice but earlier than general intermediate rice.

　　Late Rice
    There are two types: single-cropping late rice and double-cropping late rice. Single-cropping late rice is sown in spring, requiring one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty days from sowing to harvest. Double-cropping late rice is generally sown in early summer, transplanted around "Major Heat," and harvested after "Frost's Descent."

　　早稻、中稻、晚稻
　　一般说来早、中、晚稻是这样区别的：
　　早稻
    是指早春下种，从播种到收割，整个生长期在一百二十天以内的水稻。早稻分双季早稻和一季早稻两种。双季早稻的后作是双季晚稻；一季早稻的后作有的地区是晚秋作物，有的地方是留下的再生稻。
    中稻
    是指春季下种，整个生长期在一百五十天以内的水稻。有些地区把生长较早的中稻叫早中稻。这种中稻比早稻迟，比一般中稻早。
　　晚稻
    有一季晚稻和双季晚稻两种。一季晚稻春季下种，从播到收需要一百五十天到一百八十天。双季晚稻一般在初夏下种，“大暑”前后插秧，“霜降”以后收割。
