Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 20th: Iraq's former Prime Minister Ali Jawdat has formed a new cabinet on June 19th.

The cabinet of Nuri al-Said, the outgoing former Prime Minister and an active advocate of the Baghdad Pact, resigned on June 8th.

Five members of Said's cabinet continue to serve in the new cabinet. The new cabinet's Foreign Minister is concurrently held by Prime Minister Jawdat, and former Deputy Prime Minister of the Said cabinet, Ahmad Mukhtar Baban, has been reassigned as Minister of Defense.

According to UPI reports, the majority of Jawdat's cabinet members, including Jawdat himself, are pro-Western. Among them are also figures considered to hold a more conciliatory attitude towards Egypt. Jawdat is a senator and former Iraqi ambassador to the United States, and earlier this year accompanied Iraqi Crown Prince Ira on a visit to the United States.

    据新华社20日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克前首相阿里·乔达特已经在6月19日组成了新内阁。
    已卸任的前首相、巴格达条约的积极鼓吹者努里·赛义德的内阁是在6月8日辞职的。
    赛义德内阁的阁员中有五个继续在新内阁中任职。新内阁的外交大臣由首相乔达特兼任，前赛义德内阁副首相艾哈迈德·穆赫塔·巴班改任国防大臣。
    据合众社报道，乔达特内阁的绝大部分阁员，包括乔达特本人在内，都是亲西方的。其中也有被认为是对埃及采取比较调和的态度的人物。乔达特是参议员，曾任伊拉克驻美大使，今年年初曾随伊拉克王储伊拉访问美国。
