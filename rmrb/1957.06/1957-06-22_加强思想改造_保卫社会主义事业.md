Strengthen Ideological Remolding to Defend the Socialist Cause
Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society

    Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has now been formally published. This is a momentous event in the political life of our people, providing us with significant ideological weapons for handling contradictions of two different natures—contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people—in opposing our political and ideological enemies, and in building socialism. Before this, the Jiusan Society at all levels had conducted briefings and organized all members to study it many times; now we should study this document more deeply and continuously draw ideological strength from it.

    In his speech, Chairman Mao thoroughly analyzed the specific contradictions among the various classes and strata of the people in our country today, and after analyzing the various aspects of the contradictions, he proposed the formula of "unity—criticism—unity" as the fundamental guideline for resolving contradictions among the people. The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, issued in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech, also emphasized this guideline. In the past month or so, the people of all strata across the country, including members of democratic parties and the broad masses of intellectuals, have mostly proceeded from the desire for unity, exposing the shortcomings and errors existing in the work of the central and provincial/municipal leading organs, scientific research institutions, universities, and other cultural and educational institutions. Many responsible comrades of the Party committees of the institutions and schools are seriously examining the shortcomings in their work in accordance with the spirit of correcting while rectifying, proposing improvement measures, and gradually implementing them, thereby bringing a new atmosphere to the relationship between leaders and those led, and to all aspects of our work. However, in the process of helping the Communist Party to carry out the rectification, unhealthy tendencies have also emerged. Some people, instead of proceeding from the desire for unity, have deliberately exaggerated shortcomings and attacked Party members, combining this with personal grievances; what is most intolerable is that right-wing ambitious elements have taken the opportunity to publish fallacies against the Party, against the people, and against socialism, attempting to negate the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship, and the socialist road. We must resolutely counter these reactionary remarks.

    We are saddened that Chu Anping, a member of the Jiusan Society, published the absurd remarks of the so-called "Party's World". The Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and local organizations have successively held symposiums to severely refute Chu Anping's reactionary remarks and to draw a clear line with Chu Anping's reactionary thoughts, which is appropriate and necessary.

    Chairman Mao put forward six political criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds in this speech, which is of unparalleled guiding significance for us intellectuals. Although the vast majority of us intellectuals from the old society are patriotic and also approve of the socialist system, it is not easy to overcome old ideological habits and remnants of old democratic thought for a time. Therefore, we are prone to have different degrees of resistance in our minds to the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship and democratic centralism, and collectivism. At the same time, due to a lack of political acumen, it is sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. Chairman Mao's speech has given us strong ideological weapons, which will arm our minds and help us distinguish right from wrong and see through the conspiracy of the right-wing elements.

    Chairman Mao also said: "The long-term coexistence of the Communist Party and the democratic parties is our wish and our policy. As for whether the democratic parties can continue to exist for a long time, it is not solely determined by the situation of the Communist Party, but also depends on the performance of the democratic parties themselves, and whether they can gain the trust of the people." He also said: "The opinions and criticisms put forward by the democratic parties and the Communist Party to each other can only play a positive role in mutual supervision if they meet the six political criteria we mentioned earlier. Therefore, we hope that all democratic parties will pay attention to ideological remolding, strive to coexist with the Communist Party for a long time, and supervise each other to meet the needs of the new society." All members of our Jiusan Society must deeply remember Chairman Mao's instructions, further carry out ideological remolding, first draw a clear line with right-wing elements and all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, and learn from the workers and peasants, so as to continuously improve our socialist consciousness, do a good job in our posts and in united front work, and contribute all our strength to the completion of socialist construction.

### 加强思想改造  保卫社会主义事业

　　加强思想改造  保卫社会主义事业
　　九三学社主席　许德珩
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，现在正式发表了。这是我国人民政治生活中一件天大的事，它使我们在处理两种性质不同的矛盾——敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，在反对我们政治上和思想上的敌人，在建设社会主义等方面，有了重大的思想武器。九三学社各级组织在这以前曾进行过传达，并组织全体社员进行多次的学习；现在应该更加深入地学习这一文件，从这里不断地吸取思想力量。
    毛主席在讲演里详尽地分析了我国当前人民内部各阶级阶层的具体矛盾，分析了矛盾的各个方面以后，提出了“团结——批评——团结”的公式，作为解决人民内部矛盾的根本方针。中国共产党中央根据毛主席这篇讲演的精神所发布的关于整风运动的指示，也强调了这一方针。月余以来，全国各阶层人民，包括民主党派成员和广大的知识分子，绝大多数都从团结的愿望出发，揭露了中央和各省市领导机关、各科学研究机关、高等学校等文教机关工作中所存在的缺点和错误，不少的机关学校党委负责人正根据边整边改的精神，认真检查了工作中的缺点，提出了改进的办法，逐步付诸实施，从而使领导与被领导之间的关系，使我们各方面的工作出现了新的气象。但是，在帮助共产党进行整风的过程中，也出现了歪风，有的人不是从团结的愿望出发，而是结合个人的恩怨，故意夸大缺点，攻击党员；最令人不能容忍的是，右派野心分子竟乘机发表反党、反人民、反社会主义的谬论，企图否定共产党的领导，否定人民民主专政，否定社会主义道路。对于这些反动言论，我们要予以坚决的回击。
    我们感到痛心的是，九三学社社员储安平发表了所谓“党天下”的荒谬言论。九三学社中央委员会和各地组织都先后召开了座谈会，对储安平的反动言论予以严厉的驳斥，要与储安平的反动思想划清界限，这是应当的，必要的。
    毛主席在这篇讲演中提出了分辨香花毒草的六条政治标准，这对我们知识分子更有无可比拟的指导意义。我们来自旧社会的知识分子，虽然绝大多数是爱国的，也赞成社会主义制度，但是，由于旧的思想习惯和旧民主主义的思想残余一时不易克服，因之，对于共产党的领导，对于人民民主专政和民主集中制，对于集体主义，在思想上还很容易产生程度不同的抵触情绪。同时，由于政治嗅觉不高，对于香花毒草有时也难分辨清楚。毛主席的讲演给了我们坚强的思想武器，它将武装我们的头脑，帮助我们明辨是非，识破右派分子的阴谋。
    毛主席还说：“共产党同各民主党派长期共存，这是我们的愿望，也是我们的方针。至于各民主党派是否能够长期存在下去，不是单由共产党一方面的情况作决定，还要看各民主党派自己的表现，要看他们是否取得人民的信任。”又说：“各民主党派和共产党相互之间所提的意见，所作的批评，也只有在合乎我们在前面所说的六条政治标准的情况下，才能够发挥互相监督的积极作用。因此，我们希望各民主党派都能注意思想改造，争取和共产党一道长期共存，互相监督，以适应新社会的需要。”我们九三学社全体社员，要深深记住毛主席的指示，进一步进行思想改造，首先同右派分子和一切反党反社会主义的分子划清界限，并认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，向工农群众学习，以不断提高自己的社会主义觉悟，做好岗位工作和统战工作，为完成社会主义建设而贡献我们全部的力量。
