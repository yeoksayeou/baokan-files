This Newspaper Taiyuan, 16th dispatch: The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the State Council's "Instructions on Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" of June 3rd, conducted a preliminary inspection of the progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in its subordinate factories and mines.

According to statistics from sixty-one state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in the city, due to the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the total value of production plan was completed by 106.46% from January to May. At the same time, the situation of being slack in the early stage and tight in the later stage of completing the production plan in the past years was reversed, and the plan was well completed in the first quarter. In the previous period of the rectification campaign, some enterprises failed to closely integrate the rectification campaign with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement was without leadership, so that the production plan could not be completed in May. Workers of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and other factories have already criticized the leaders for this, believing that they should not have dropped the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement when they grasped the rectification campaign, thus reducing the income of the state and the workers.

Based on the above situation, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to do the following work at present: First, organize sixty leading cadres to conduct another concentrated publicity and education on the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to the city's workers and masses, explaining the guiding principle of building the country through thrift and diligence and the great significance of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement now. This report should be completed by June 20th at the latest. Through this publicity, the idea of building the country through thrift and diligence should be deeply rooted in the daily activities of the workers and masses, and a good atmosphere of careful calculation, diligent production, glory in thrift and diligence, and shame in waste should be established among the broad masses of workers. Second, urge all enterprises to check the implementation of the production plan, find weak links, and try to remedy them. Third, each factory and mine should summarize the effective advanced experiences in its own enterprise since the beginning of the year, and further carry out the advanced producer movement with the promotion of advanced experience and the suggestion of rationalization proposals as the central content. Fourth, conduct a general safety inspection, take measures, and overcome the shortcomings of the poor safety production situation in the previous period. Fifth, the leading cadres of each enterprise should appropriately divide their work to ensure that both rectification and production are not neglected.

At present, the city's reporters have been organized. All enterprises are carrying out various tasks according to the decisions of the Municipal Party Committee.

This Newspaper Baoding, 16th dispatch: The Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is taking active measures to reverse the slack leadership phenomenon in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

Since May, due to the relaxation of the leadership of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in many factories and enterprises, twelve of the forty-two factories and enterprises in the city have not completed the May Increase Production and Practice Economy plan. There are many reasons for the slack leadership. Some are due to the increase in meetings after the start of the rectification campaign, and the party, government, labor union and other departments in the factory are not in step, lacking a unified arrangement for the current important work, and failing to grasp the central task of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement; some are due to the relaxation of political and ideological education in the process of studying the correct handling of contradictions among the people; some lack concrete measures to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in a deep and lasting way.

Based on this situation, the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the situation and problems of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement since the second quarter, and to put forward specific improvement measures. On the afternoon of the 11th, the Municipal Party Committee had already convened a meeting of the party committee secretaries of various factories and transportation and power systems to specifically deploy this inspection work.

　　广泛宣传勤俭建国方针　大力扭转领导松弛现象
　　太原保定深入开展增产节约运动
    本报太原16日电　中共太原市委根据6月3日国务院“关于进一步开展增产节约运动的指示”，对所属厂矿开展增产节约运动的情况进行了初步检查。
    据全市六十一个国营、地方国营厂矿的统计，由于增产节约运动的开展，1至5月份完成生产总值计划106.46％，同时扭转了历年来完成生产计划前松后紧的局面，在第一季很好地完成了计划。在前一时期整风运动中，有些企业由于没有把整风运动同增产节约运动密切结合起来，增产节约运动无人领导，以致在5月份没有能完成生产计划。太原重型机器厂等的工人，已经为此向领导人员提出了批评，认为不应当抓了整风丢了增产节约运动，使国家和工人都减少收入。
    根据上述情况，中共太原市委决定当前要做好如下工作：一、组织六十名领导干部向全市职工群众再集中地进行一次增产节约运动的宣传教育，讲明勤俭建国的方针和现在开展增产节约运动的重大意义。这次报告最迟要在6月20日以前结束。通过这次宣传，要使勤俭建国的思想深入到职工群众的日常活动中去，在广大职工中树立起精打细算、勤劳生产、节约光荣、浪费可耻的风气。二、督促各企业检查生产计划执行情况，发现薄弱环节，设法补救。三、由各厂矿总结年初以来在本企业行之有效的先进经验，进一步开展以推广先进经验和提合理化建议为中心内容的先进生产者运动。四、普遍进行一次安全大检查，采取措施，克服前一段时间安全生产情况不好的缺点。五、各个企业的领导干部应适当分工，保证做到整风生产两不误。
    目前，全市报告员已经组织起来。各企业正根据市委的决定展开各项工作。
    本报保定16日电　中共保定市委正采取积极措施，扭转领导增产节约运动的松弛现象。
    5月份以来，由于许多工厂企业放松了对增产节约运动的领导，全市四十二个工厂企业中，有十二个单位没有完成5月份的增产节约计划。造成领导松弛的原因很多。有的是由于整风运动开始后增加了一些会议，厂里党政工团步调不一致，对当前重要工作缺乏统一的安排，没有抓住增产节约运动这一中心工作；有的是在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学习过程中，放松了政治思想教育工作；有的是对深入持久地开展增产节约运动缺乏具体办法。
    中共保定市委根据这一情况，最近决定对第二季度以来增产节约运动的情况和问题进行一次全面的检查，并要提出具体的改进措施。11日下午，市委已经召开各工厂、交通电业系统党委书记会议，具体部署了这次检查工作。
