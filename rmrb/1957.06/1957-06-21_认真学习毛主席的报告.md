　　Conscientiously Study Chairman Mao's Report
　　Chairman of the China Democratic League, Shen Junru

　　Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been published. After reading it, I felt very excited and expressed my heartfelt support. Chairman Mao's speech is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism under China's specific conditions, and it has great guiding significance for our country's socialist construction and the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Our democratic parties and the comrades of the Democratic League should study it conscientiously.

　　Within our democratic parties and the Democratic League, there are some right-wing elements who are anti-Party and anti-socialist. Their words and deeds violate the six political criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds put forward by Chairman Mao in this speech. These six criteria are: (1) It should be conducive to uniting the people of all nationalities in the country, rather than dividing the people; (2) It should be conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction, rather than detrimental to socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) It should be conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, rather than undermining or weakening this dictatorship; (4) It should be conducive to consolidating democratic centralism, rather than undermining or weakening this system; (5) It should be conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, rather than shaking off or weakening this leadership; (6) It should be conducive to socialist international unity and the international unity of peace-loving people all over the world, rather than detrimental to these unities.

　　I believe that when our democratic parties and the comrades of the Democratic League study Chairman Mao's speech now, we should pay special attention to studying these six political criteria. With clear standards, we can distinguish right from wrong and draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements.

　　认真学习毛主席的报告
　　中国民主同盟主席　沈钧儒
    毛主席的讲演“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表了。我读了之后，感到非常兴奋，而且表示衷心的拥护。毛主席的这篇讲演是马克思列宁主义在中国具体情况下的创造性的发展，对于我国建设社会主义和正确处理人民内部矛盾，有极大的指导意义。我们民主党派、民主同盟的同志们应当认真地学习。
    我们民主党派内部、民主同盟内部有一些反党反社会主义的右派分子，他们的言行违背了毛主席在这篇讲演里提出的，辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准。这六条标准是：（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。
    我认为，我们民主党派、民主同盟的同志现在学习毛主席这篇讲演的时候，要特别注意学习这六条政治标准。有了明确的标准，就可以辨别是非，同右派分子划清界限。
