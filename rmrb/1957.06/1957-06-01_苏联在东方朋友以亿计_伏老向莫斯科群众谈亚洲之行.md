Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st - After concluding a long friendly visit to China and other Asian countries, Chairman Voroshilov returned to Moscow by jet airliner at 4:30 p.m. on the 30th.

Despite the long flight, Voroshilov looked radiant and was in good spirits. After disembarking, he embraced Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Khrushchev, and others who came to welcome him, and warmly shook hands with each of the welcomers.

It was raining, and braving the rain at Vnukovo Airport, 30 kilometers from the city center, to welcome him were diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union and several thousand representatives of the Moscow masses.

Upon arrival, Voroshilov went by car to the Palace of Sports to attend a mass welcome rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st - Chairman Voroshilov said in Moscow on May 30th that his visit to China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mongolia had once again proven that the Soviet Union has hundreds of millions of friends in Eastern countries. The people of socialist countries and the people of all countries who have freed themselves from colonial oppression respect and love the Soviet Union.

Voroshilov said that we are once again convinced that the Soviet Union's unwavering struggle for international peace and friendship, for the elimination of colonialism and for the equality of all nations, and for social progress is understood and felt close to by the people of Asian countries.

Voroshilov made these remarks at a welcome rally held for him at the Moscow Sports Palace, attended by more than 10,000 people. Prior to his speech, representatives of Moscow workers, students, and scientists spoke successively, welcoming his return from the visit.

In his speech, Voroshilov said that he had seen the actual results of work in the era of people's power in China. Fundamental democratic reforms and socialist transformations have been realized in all aspects of economic and social life. Culture, science, education, and health undertakings are developing victoriously. In all the achievements of the Chinese people, one can see the wise policies of the Chinese Communist Party, which have been tested by life. The Chinese Communist Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism in combination with the specific conditions of the country, and it has gained a lofty prestige among all strata of the Chinese people. The Chinese people believe in their own strength and are determined to make their economy and culture more prosperous in the coming years.

Voroshilov pointed out that we saw the unity of the people, the Communist Party, and the government in China, which is an inexhaustible source of all China's achievements. The workers, peasants, intellectuals, responsible persons of democratic parties, and industrialists and businessmen we met all told us that they fully support the Communist Party's policies in building socialism and actively participate in socialist construction.

He said that the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government steadfastly adhere to the principles of proletarian internationalism and constantly strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. We have heard the most beautiful words about the eternal and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship from residents of all different strata in China, and sincere gratitude for the selfless assistance of the Soviet people.

Voroshilov emphasized that the Chinese government and the entire people warmly support the Soviet government's efforts on major international issues.

Speaking about his visit to Indonesia, Voroshilov said that the people of this country have encountered serious consequences of colonialist rule since gaining independence. Despite significant achievements in developing the national economy and culture, the Indonesian people still have to fight against the remnants of colonialism under difficult conditions. Colonialists still have a large economic force in Indonesia, and they use this force to try to exert pressure on Indonesia.

Voroshilov then spoke about the tremendous work completed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people in the past three years, and their struggle to achieve peaceful reunification of Vietnam on a democratic basis.

Finally, Voroshilov spoke of the significant achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in economic and cultural development.

    苏联在东方朋友以亿计
    伏老向莫斯科群众谈亚洲之行
    新华社莫斯科31日电　伏罗希洛夫主席在结束了对中国和其他一些亚洲国家的长途友好访问后，30日下午四时半乘喷气式客机回到莫斯科。
    伏老虽经长途飞行，但是面色红润，精神愉快。他下机后同前来欢迎的苏联共产党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫等拥抱，并且热烈地同欢迎者一一握手。
    天下着雨，冒雨前来离市区三十公里的伏努科夫机场欢迎他的，还有各国驻苏联的外交使节和几千莫斯科群众代表。
    伏老抵达后，即乘车前往体育宫参加群众欢迎大会。
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　伏罗希洛夫主席5月30日在莫斯科说，他对中国、印度尼西亚、越南和蒙古的访问，又一次证明了苏联在东方国家中有着数以亿计的朋友。社会主义国家的人民以及摆脱了殖民主义压迫的各国人民尊敬和热爱苏联。
    伏罗希洛夫说，我们再一次确信，苏联坚定不移地争取国际和平和友谊、争取消灭殖民主义和争取一切民族平等、争取社会进步的斗争，是为亚洲各国人民所理解和感到亲近的。
    伏罗希洛夫的这番话是他在莫斯科体育宫内为他举行的一万多人参加的欢迎大会上说的。他的讲话历时约一小时。在他讲话以前，莫斯科工人、学生和科学家的代表们先后致词，欢迎他的访问归来。
    伏罗希洛夫在讲话中说，他在中国已经看到了人民政权时代的工作的实际成果。在经济和社会生活的各个方面中实现了根本的民主改革和社会主义改造。文化、科学、教育和卫生事业都在胜利地发展中。在中国人民的一切成就中，可以看出中国共产党的经受过生活考验的英明政策。中国共产党结合本国的特殊条件创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，它在中国人民各阶层中获得了崇高的威信。中国人民相信自己的力量，并且决心要在最近几年使经济、文化得到更大的繁荣。
    伏罗希洛夫指出，我们在中国看到了人民、共产党和政府的团结一致，这种团结一致是中国一切成就的取之不尽的源泉。我们所会见的工人、农民、知识分子、民主党派负责人和工商界人士都对我们说，他们完全支持共产党在建设社会主义方面的政策，并且积极地参加社会主义建设。
    他说，中国人民、中国共产党和政府坚定不移地本着无产阶级国际主义原则，不断加强中苏友谊。我们从中国各个不同阶层的居民中都听到关于永恒的和牢不可破的中苏友谊的最美好的话，关于对苏联人民无私帮助的真诚感谢。
    伏罗希洛夫强调指出，中国政府和全体人民热烈支持苏联政府在重大国际问题上所作的努力。
    谈到访问印度尼西亚的时候，伏罗希洛夫说，这个国家的人民在获得独立以后，碰到了殖民主义者统治的严重后果。尽管在发展国民经济和文化方面获得了显著成就，但是，印度尼西亚人民仍然不得不在困难的条件下，向殖民主义遗毒作斗争。殖民主义者在印度尼西亚仍旧有很大的经济势力，他们利用这种势力企图对印度尼西亚横加压力。
    伏罗希洛夫接着谈到了越南民主共和国和越南人民在过去三年中完成的巨大工作，以及他们为争取在民主的基础上和平统一越南而进行的斗争。
    伏罗希洛夫最后谈到了蒙古人民共和国在经济和文化发展方面的重大成就。
