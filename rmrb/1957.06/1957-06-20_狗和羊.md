　　Dogs and Sheep

    "I'll tell you a fable," my friend said to me, "but before I officially begin, I want to offer some comments. I think some fables are just illustrations of concepts, often using birds and beasts as a disguise to forcefully explain a principle. But I believe that life is the source of fables. Sometimes people's lives can directly become a fable, without needing to hang up the sign of animals. The other day when we went to the mine to visit, we saw a fable."

    That was a mining area where explosions were constantly heard. After we finished watching the molten iron flow at the iron and steel plant, we saw two or three flocks of sheep on the way back. Behind each flock of sheep followed a small dog – a dog that was thin and small, and could barely walk. The shepherd often had to raise his whip to force the dog to catch up with the sheep.

    "Why raise such a dog?" we asked.

    "To keep the wolves away," was the answer, seemingly surprised that we would ask such a question. "That's the old custom passed down through generations of shepherds."

    "With such constant explosions, are there still wolves?"

    "Old customs are still old customs, it's good to guard against the unexpected. Besides, the dog is quite small, and it doesn't take much to feed it."

    "You see, isn't this a ready-made fable about 'new situation, old methods'?" my friend continued to comment. "In our work, aren't we sometimes still tolerating those old methods that have actually become formalism, just because the dog doesn't take much to feed?"

    我给你讲一个寓言；——我的朋友跟我说，——可是在正式开讲之前，我要发点议论。我看有些寓言只是概念的图解，往往拿飞禽走兽做个幌子，硬装斧头柄地说明一个道理。我可认为生活才是寓言的源泉，有时候人的生活可以直接成为一篇寓言，不必挂上禽兽的招牌。那一天我们去矿山里参观，就看到了一篇寓言。
    那是个不时传来爆破声的矿区。我们从炼铁厂看罢铁水奔流回来，在归途上看到二、三批羊群。每一批羊群后面都跟着一条小狗，——一条又瘦又小、连路也走不动的小狗。牧羊人时常要扬一扬鞭，才能逼着那小狗赶上羊群。
    “干么要养那末一条狗呢？”我们问。
    “养狗防狼啊，”答话之间，似乎很以我们问得出奇。“那是牧羊人世世代代的老规矩了。”
    “这样不断的爆破，还会有狼？”
    “老规矩总还是老规矩，防个万一也是好的。——再说呢，狗挺小，养着也不费事。”
    你瞧，这不是一则关于“新形势，老办法”的现成寓言吗？——我的朋友继续发表议论道，——我们在工作里，岂不是有时也因为小狗养着不费事，而还在容忍着那些实际上已成为形式主义的老办法吗？
