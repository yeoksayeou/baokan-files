Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th - The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee continued its closed-door meeting on the 3rd. According to Western news agencies, the Soviet representative reiterated at the meeting its advocacy for reaching an immediate and temporary agreement on the suspension of nuclear weapons tests.

It has been over a month since the Soviet Union proposed new suggestions for partial disarmament. The United States is said to have prepared a counter-proposal, but it has not yet been presented at the committee meeting. Reuters reports that the United States will not submit its new proposal for another week. The U.S. representative is still consulting with other Western country representatives.

The next meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee is scheduled for the 5th.
