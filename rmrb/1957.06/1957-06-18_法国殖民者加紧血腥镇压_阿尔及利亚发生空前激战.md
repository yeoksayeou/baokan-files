Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 17th: The Algerian National Liberation Army engaged in a fierce battle with French troops in the mountainous region near Tebessa in eastern Algeria on the 15th. This was the largest battle in the two years and six months of the Algerian War. The battle lasted for ten hours, with the French army deploying one hundred reconnaissance planes, fighter planes, and bombers to cooperate with ground troops in attacking the Algerian National Liberation Army forces.

According to French statistics, the Algerian insurgents lost 205 people in this battle, while the French army had 42 wounded and 14 killed. According to the commander of the French army in this war zone, this battle was carried out under the orders of Resident Minister Robert Lacoste to intensify the suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement. General Salan, commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria, also issued a bloody order before the battle began, saying, "Do not stop until the rebels are crushed." A battalion of the French army also clashed with Algerian insurgents southeast of Constantine.

Furthermore, according to "L'Humanité Hebdo," since Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury became the French Prime Minister, a new wave of suppression has been launched in Algeria. Many Algerians have been arrested in recent days. Among those arrested was the president of "Républicain Algérien" newspaper, because the newspaper advocated solving the Algerian issue through negotiation. Many Algerian communists were also among those arrested.

　　法国殖民者加紧血腥镇压
　　阿尔及利亚发生空前激战
    新华社17日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军15日同法军在阿尔及利亚东部德培萨附近山区发生激烈战斗，这是在持续了两年又六个月的阿尔及利亚战争中规模最大的一次战斗。战斗延续了十小时，法军出动了一百架侦察机、战斗机和轰炸机配合地面部队向阿尔及利亚民族解放军部队进攻。
    据法方统计，在这次战斗中阿尔及利亚起义者损失了二百零五人，法军有四十二人受伤，十四人阵亡。据这个战区的法军司令透露，这次战斗是根据法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长拉戈斯特的加紧镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的命令而进行的。阿尔及利亚法军总司令萨兰将军在战斗开始前也发布了血腥的命令说，“不粉碎叛乱者决不住手。”法军的一个营和阿尔及利亚起义者在君士坦丁城东南也发生了冲突。
    又据“人道报星期刊”报道，布歇—莫努里担任法国总理以后，在阿尔及利亚又一次掀起镇压浪潮。最近几天有许多阿尔及利亚人被捕。被捕的人中有“共和阿尔及尔报”报社社长，因为这家报纸主张用谈判的方法来解决阿尔及利亚问题。被捕的人中还有许多阿尔及利亚共产党员。
