Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Special Dispatch: Democratic figures in Guangdong Province held a symposium on the 11th, engaging in a debate on whether ideological clashes should be conducted while "fully airing views" and "contending freely."

　　Liu Shaowu, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee Counselor's Office, said in his speech that he disagreed with engaging in debates on the "prominent ideas" that have emerged too early. He said that doing so would make people feel that the Party called on us to offer opinions, but now it is finding typical examples to criticize, thus creating new concerns. This would not be very helpful to the Party's rectification campaign.

　　Feng Boheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), disagreed with Liu Shaowu's opinion. He said that fundamentally erroneous viewpoints, such as those opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, must be countered with criticism. Feng Boheng disagreed with the notion that counter-criticism of anti-socialist fallacies is a "retraction." He said that Ge Peiqi can say that he doesn't want the leadership of the Communist Party, but can't we ask him in return: if not the Communist Party, who should lead? Some people say that this will make people have concerns, but I disagree. The Communist Party has long said "those who speak are not guilty." As for counter-criticizing some anti-socialist viewpoints, it is to raise "airing views" and "contending freely" to a higher stage, to correct the position and distinguish the direction. What's wrong with that?

　　Fang Shaoyi, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the RCCK, disagreed with some people's claim that the People's Daily's recent editorials meant that it had reached the "retraction" and "rectification" stage. He said that the CCP's established policy of listening to the opinions of the masses will never be "retracted." However, if someone wants to take advantage of the rectification campaign to peddle anti-socialist remarks, or even attempt to negate the leading position of the working class, then it is not simply a question about the Party, but an attempt to overthrow the Constitution. Not only will the CCP disagree with this, but the people will also firmly oppose it.

　　People's Daily, Lanzhou, 12th: What attitude should the Communist Party's newspapers take towards some anti-socialist remarks and actions that have emerged in helping the Communist Party's rectification campaign? This is the question debated by some democratic figures in Gansu Province at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee these days.

　　An Lisui, Deputy Director of the Liaison Work Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), said: The emergence of a little speech and actions departing from socialism should not be seen as an intensification of the class struggle. The People's Daily is the helmsman of the journalistic field, and it seems there is no need to be dizzy and frightened. It is too early to publish editorials to "correct deviations". If "deviation correction" is necessary, it should be left to the Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, and Ta Kung Pao to correct, and to the masses and democratic parties to correct. It is inevitable that the People's Daily coming forward to correct it will make people suspect that the Party is afraid, wants to implement a "retraction", and wants to prevent "letting go". He believes that the Gansu Daily should also avoid this issue. He advocated that the Provincial Political Consultative Conference and the democratic parties should jointly run another publication to open up a new "airing views" and "contending freely" garden.

　　Zhang Linghan, a counselor of the Provincial Counselor's Office, criticized An Lisui's erroneous opinion in his speech. He believes that the recent editorials published by the People's Daily are giving everyone a warning that we must not forget that the class struggle has not completely ended in the rectification campaign! It has brightened the eyes of the people.

　　Prior to this, Qi Min, a member of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CDL, also believed that some people wanted to take the opportunity to do away with socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party should come out and speak, and the Party's newspapers in particular should not remain silent on this. The people will be confused and uneasy if they do not see the Party's opinion.

### 反批评是不是“收”？  广东甘肃党外人士就本报社论展开论战

　　反批评是不是“收”？
　　广东甘肃党外人士就本报社论展开论战
    本报特约新华社广州讯　广东省许多民主人士在11日举行的座谈会上，对于是否应该在“大放”“大鸣”的同时进行思想交锋的问题展开争论。
    广州市人民委员会参事室副主任刘绍武发言说：他不同意过早地对目前出现的“突出思想”进行争论。他说，否则会使人感到党号召我们提意见，现在又找典型来批判，因而产生新的顾虑。这样对党的整风帮助不大。
    民革中央委员冯伯恒不同意刘绍武的意见。他说，对于一些带有根本性的严重错误的论点，例如反对社会主义、反对工人阶级和共产党领导的意见，这必须予以反批评。冯伯恒不同意对反社会主义的谬论提出反批评就是“收”这种说法。他说，葛佩琦可以说不要共产党领导，难道我们不可以反问他一句：不要共产党领导要谁来领导呢？有人说，这样会使人产生顾虑，我也不同意。共产党早已说过“言者无罪”。至于对一些反社会主义的论点进行反批评，是为了使“放”、“鸣”提高到更高的阶段，以端正立场，分清方向，这有什么不好呢？
    民革广州市委员会副主任委员方少逸不同意一些人认为人民日报最近发表了几篇社论就是到了“收”“整”阶段的说法。他说，中共倾听群众的意见是既定的方针，是永远不会“收”的。但是如果有人想借整风而贩卖反社会主义的言论，甚至企图否定工人阶级的领导地位，那就不单纯是关于党的问题，而是企图推翻宪法。这不但中共不同意，人民也是坚决反对的。
    本报兰州12日电　对于在帮助共产党整风中出现的一些反社会主义的言论和行动，共产党的报纸应该采取什么态度？这是甘肃省的一部分民主人士这几天在中共甘肃省委统战部召开的座谈会上争论的问题。
    民革甘肃省委会联系工作委员会副主任安立绥说：出现一点离开社会主义的言论和行动，不能看作阶级斗争的尖锐化。人民日报是新闻界的掌舵者，似乎无须头晕目眩和胆战心惊。发表社论“纠偏”未免为时过早。如果要“纠偏”，应该让光明日报、文汇报和大公报去纠，让人民群众和各民主党派去纠。人民日报出马来纠，难免叫人怀疑党是害怕了，要实行“收”，要防止“放”。他认为甘肃日报也应该回避这个问题。他主张由省政协和各民主党派另办一个刊物，开辟新的“鸣”“放”园地。
    省参事室参事张凌汉在发言中批评了安立绥的错误意见。他认为人民日报最近发表的几篇社论是给大家敲警钟，在整风中不能忘记阶级斗争还没有完全结束！它拭亮了人民群众的眼睛。
    在这以前，民盟甘肃省委委员戚民也认为：有人想借机不要社会主义和不要共产党的领导。共产党应该出来讲话，党的报纸尤其不能对此保持沉默。人民群众看不到党的意见就会困惑不安。
