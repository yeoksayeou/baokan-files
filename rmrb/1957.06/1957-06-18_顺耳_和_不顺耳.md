"Pleasing to the Ear" and "Unpleasant to the Ear"
Yue Jun

Tian Dawen, a professor at a certain military medical school stationed in Tianjin of the People's Liberation Army, said: "Before today, the Party newspaper did not allow the people to speak. What was pleasing to the ear was published, and what was unpleasant to the ear was not published at all. Today, although opinions are widely solicited, and people are encouraged to speak out freely, in reality, only principled and painless words can be published. Truly, listing real people and events that touch on painful points is absolutely not allowed. In this way, the mouths of the people are sealed." (See Tianjin Daily, June 10th) At first glance, it seems that everyone who speaks in the newspaper is "non-people." Does the Party newspaper allow the people to speak? If I simply answer that the Party newspaper speaks on behalf of the people and fully allows the people to speak, this does not solve the problem. Mr. Tian Dawen may say: Have you asked every one or most of the six hundred million people? The best way is to ask himself: Do you yourself count as one of the "people"? If so, then how could the Tianjin Municipal Committee's newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party publish your statement? Perhaps Mr. Tian will say again: "These are just principled and painless words, so they can still be published." Then, doesn't Chu Anping's "offering suggestions to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou" count as real people and events? In your opinion, do his so-called "Party-dominated world" remarks and Ge Peiqi's "no need for Communist Party leadership" remarks count as "touching on painful points"?

Chen Shihua, Vice President of Tsinghua University, said it well: "Sometimes intellectuals don't reason much." This sentence is truly insightful for some people. The mouths of the people were almost sealed before liberation. Teahouses had signs that read "Please do not discuss national affairs," and when speaking at home, one had to be careful of eavesdroppers. Progressive newspapers were censored or closed down. Now that the people are liberated, they have never been able to speak so freely as they can today. Why does Mr. Tian Dawen insist on denying these facts? There is only one explanation: their asses are not sitting with the people. What sounds pleasing to the ear of the people sounds very unpleasant to them. The people want to oppose and eliminate corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and counter-revolutionaries, but Tian Dawen says: "The Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns and the anti-rightist movement were all terrible movements." (See Tianjin Daily, June 10th) Isn't this very clear? Their so-called "pleasing to the ear" and "unpleasant to the ear" are precisely two different things from the people's "pleasing to the ear" and "unpleasant to the ear." What "socialism," what "Communist Party leadership," what "proletarian dictatorship"... these are really too unpleasant to the ear, while what they find pleasing to the ear is precisely what is not in the newspaper. Recently, some pleasing words have begun to appear, but they have been met with so much opposition, it's truly about to "seal" the mouths of "people." From the people's point of view, what's wrong with "sealing" some anti-socialist malpractices?

　　“顺耳”和“不顺耳”
　　岳军
    解放军驻津某军医学校教授田大文说：“党报在今天以前不准人民说话，顺耳的给登，不顺耳的根本不给登；到了今日，虽然广开言路，大鸣大放，但实际上只是原则性的不疼不痒的话尚可以发表出来，真是列举真人真事触及痛处则绝对不给登。这样，就把人民的嘴给填死了；”（见6月10日天津日报）乍听起来，似乎在报上说话的都是“非人民”。党报有没有让人民说话呢？如果我简单地回答说，党报是代表人民说话，而且是充分让人民说话的，这不解决问题，田大文先生也许会说：你问过六亿人民的每个人或大部分人了？最好的办法还是问他自己：你自己算不算“人民”中的一个？如果算，那末中国共产党天津市委机关报怎么会登你的发言呢？也许田先生又会说：“我这只是原则性的不痛不痒的话，所以尚可以发表出来。”那末，储安平的“向毛主席周总理提意见”，这算不算真人真事？依你看，他的所谓“党天下”的言论和葛佩琦的“不要共产党领导”的言论算不算“触及痛处”？
    清华大学陈士骅副校长说得好：“有时候知识分子也不大讲道理。”这句话对某些人真是一言道破的。人民的嘴在解放前几乎被填死了，茶馆里贴着“请勿谈国家大事”的字条，在家说话要谨防隔墙有人偷听，进步报纸开天窗、被封闭。现在人民解放了，他们从来也没有像今天这样能够畅所欲言。为什么田大文先生偏要否认这些事实？那只有一种解释：他们的屁股并不和人民坐在一起的。人民听来顺耳的话，他们听来却很不顺耳。人民要反对、肃清的贪污、浪费、官僚主义和反革命分子，而田大文却说：“三反、肃反都是糟糕透顶的运动。”（见6月10日天津日报）这不是很明白吗？他们的所谓“顺耳”、“不顺耳”和人民的“顺耳”、“不顺耳”恰恰是两回事；什么“社会主义”啦，什么“共产党领导”啦，什么“无产阶级专政”啦……这些实在太不顺耳了，而他们感到顺耳的，报上却偏偏没有，最近刚刚有一些顺耳的话出现，却遭到那么多人的反对，真是快把“人”的嘴“填死”了。从人民的立场看来，“填死”一些反社会主义的歪风，又有什么不好呢？
