Title: How can we not praise the outstanding labor of the working class! Steel and coal production greatly exceeded the plan in five months, with 400,000 more tons of iron, 590,000 more tons of steel, and more than 4 million more tons of coal than in the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The steel industry has made great achievements in increasing production and practicing economy.

　　From January to May, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry increased production by more than 50,000 tons of iron, more than 50,000 tons of steel, more than 110,000 tons of steel products, and more than 350,000 tons of iron ore. Compared with the same period last year, the first five months of this year saw an increase of 400,000 tons of pig iron, 400,000 tons of steel, and 590,000 tons of steel products.

　　A new and remarkable event occurred in the steel industry's production increase and economy drive this year: Anhui Province, which originally did not mine iron ore and therefore was not included in the ore production plan, guaranteed to supply the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry with more than 600,000 tons of ore this year; some of the ore has a particularly high iron content and can be directly used for steelmaking. These more than 600,000 tons of ore are the result of "giving play to local initiative." At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry telegraphed Anhui and other provinces to help solve the difficulty of insufficient ore. After research, Anhui Province decided to organize farmers to mine in the marginal areas of the Ma'anshan Iron Mine, estimating that more than 600,000 tons could be mined this year. For the same reason, Hebei Province can supply more than 700,000 tons of ore to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this year than originally planned, and Jiangsu Province can also supply more than 100,000 tons of ore to the ministry than originally planned. Some of these provinces have already supplied a large amount of ore to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the first five months. The fact that the localities can increase production of so much ore demonstrates a huge production potential that was not discovered or tapped in previous years.

　　Thanks to the support of the localities and the efforts of the staff and workers of the mines under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, it is estimated that nearly 2 million tons of iron ore can be produced this year. The increase in iron ore production has created important conditions for ensuring the normal production of China's steel industry this year and for increasing the annual production of iron by more than 200,000 tons and steel by about 200,000 tons.

　　The quality of products from January to May was also very good, and the pass rates of products such as pig iron, steel ingots, and steel products have all been improved.

　　In terms of saving ore and coke, the average saving was 40 kilograms of coke and dozens of kilograms of iron ore per ton of iron smelted in the first five months; a total of 80,000 tons of coke and nearly 100,000 tons of iron ore were saved in five months.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry: From January to May this year, the national state-owned coal mines produced a total of 35.91 million tons of coal, 1.11 million tons more than the state plan, and 4.3 million tons more than the same period last year.

　　The daily output of state-owned coal mines also gradually increased in the first five months of this year. The average daily output of state-owned coal mines in the first quarter of this year was 240,000 tons, and by May, the average daily output rose to 254,000 tons, an increase of 14,000 tons compared with the first quarter. Although the state-owned coal mines were affected by the influenza epidemic in late March and early April, with workers being absent from work due to illness for 300,000 workdays and producing 370,000 tons less coal, which prevented the completion of the April production plan. However, after entering May, the production situation was particularly good. According to the statistics of 35 mining bureaus, except for eight that completed the plan poorly, all the others overfulfilled the production plan. Therefore, the coal produced more in May not only made up for the shortfall in April, but also exceeded the state plan by more than 240,000 tons.

　　According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Coal Industry, although the output plan of state-owned coal mines from January to May this year was completed very well, the safety situation was not good, and the number of accidents increased compared with the same period last year. This is something that coal mines in various regions should pay attention to in future production.

### 工人阶级的出色劳动怎能不歌颂！　五个月钢铁煤炭产量大大超过计划　比去年同期多产四十万吨铁、五十九万吨钢材、四百多万吨煤

　　工人阶级的出色劳动怎能不歌颂！
　　五个月钢铁煤炭产量大大超过计划
　　比去年同期多产四十万吨铁、五十九万吨钢材、四百多万吨煤
    新华社14日讯　钢铁工业增产节约获得很大成绩。
    1到5月份冶金工业部增产了五万多吨铁，五万多吨钢，十一万多吨钢材和三十五万吨铁矿石。和去年同期相比，今年前五个月多生产了四十万吨生铁，四十万吨钢和五十九万吨钢材。
    今年钢铁工业增产节约中，出现了一件新奇的事情：一个原来没有开采铁矿因此也没有列入矿石生产计划的安徽省，今年保证供应冶金工业部六十多万吨矿石；其中有些矿石含铁量特别高，可以直接炼钢。这六十多万吨矿石是“发挥地方积极性”的结果。今年年初，冶金工业部曾电请安徽等省帮助解决矿石不足的困难。安徽省经过研究，决定组织农民在马鞍山铁矿边沿区开采，估计今年能开采六十多万吨。由于同样的原因，河北省今年供应冶金工业部的矿石可以超过原计划七十多万吨，江苏省供应这个部的矿石也可以超过原计划十多万吨。这些省有的在前五个月已经供应了冶金部大量的矿石。地方上能增产这样多的矿石，这是往年没有发现或没有挖掘的巨大的增产潜力。
    由于地方的支援和冶金工业部所属矿山职工的努力，估计今年能增产近二百万吨铁矿石。铁矿石的增产，为保证今年我国钢铁工业的正常生产，为全年增产二十多万吨铁和二十万吨左右的钢材，创造了重要条件。
    1到5月份产品质量的情况也很好，生铁、钢锭和钢材等产品的合格率都有所提高。
    在节约矿石和焦炭方面，前五个月每炼一吨铁平均节省了四十公斤焦炭和几十公斤铁矿石；五个月总共节省八万吨焦炭和将近十万吨铁矿石。
    新华社14日讯　据煤炭工业部统计：今年1月到5月，全国国营煤矿共计生产了三千五百九十一万吨煤，比国家计划多生产了一百一十一万吨，比去年同期增加了四百三十万吨。
    今年前五个月国营煤矿的日产量也是逐步上升的。今年第一季度国营煤矿的平均日产量是二十四万吨，到5月份平均日产量上升到二十五万四千吨，即比第一季度增加了一万四千吨。国营煤矿在3月下旬和4月上旬，虽然因受到流行性感冒侵袭的影响，工人因病缺勤的达三十万个工作日，少生产煤三十七万吨，使4月份没有完成产量计划。但是进入5月份以后，生产情况特别好，据三十五个矿务局统计除了八个完成计划较差外，其余全都超额完成了产量计划。因此，5月份多生产的煤不但弥补了4月份欠产的数字，还超过国家计划二十四万多吨。
    据煤炭工业部负责人谈，国营煤矿今年1到5月的产量计划虽然完成得很好，但是安全情况却不好，事故比去年同期增加，这是值得各地煤矿在今后生产中注意的。
