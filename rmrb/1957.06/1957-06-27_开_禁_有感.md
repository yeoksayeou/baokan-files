Thoughts on Opening the "Forbidden"
　　Fan Cuiping

　　Amidst the voices of blooming and contending, the Ministry of Culture has opened up the "forbidden plays." Many theatrical works can now reappear on stage, which gives performers a sense of openness in their thinking, thereby stimulating their enthusiasm. This is an extremely wise measure and should be affirmed and supported.

　　However, some people believe that if there is an "opening" today, why was there a "ban" in the first place? This shows that the previous stage was completely wrong. I think this view is incorrect. Regardless of whether "ban" or "open" should adapt to the environment: in the early days of liberation, when performers lacked understanding and the masses could not distinguish clearly, a certain degree of restriction could be imposed to avoid creating confusion in sight and sound; when performers have gained understanding and the masses can distinguish between good and bad, it is necessary to fully open up and let the audience freely choose, in order to determine the true value of these plays. In addition, we cannot deny the damage caused by the previous "strict rules and regulations" and the style of some literary and art cadres, but we cannot completely ignore the leap-forward development of the opera industry in the past seven years, nor can we think that the leadership of the Communist Party is completely unacceptable because of some unsatisfactory and crude aspects shown in the development process. May I ask: the emancipation of performers, the emphasis on folk art, the development of local opera genres, the tax exemption for opera, the relief for veteran artists, the help for opera troupes, etc... were these left by the Kuomintang government? To use an analogy: if a well-built Western-style building leaks, it should only be a problem of "building," and it cannot be said that the Western-style building was built wrongly, and it is not as good as a thatched hut.

　　As someone who has been engaged in the drama business for more than twenty years, I feel that "opening the ban" is a sign that the government expresses absolute trust in the performers, believing that we performers have improved our political consciousness through the social changes of the past seven years, and are able to distinguish right from wrong and understand our own position. We should cherish this trust, and be good at choosing: which plays are suitable for today and beneficial to the people, which plays are somewhat in conflict with socialist moral standards, which plays can be fully embraced, and which plays need to be refined before being presented. Of course, fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds can (and should) be allowed to bloom at the same time, but if it is indeed clear that it is a poisonous weed, there is no need to waste valuable time and useful energy, and take more detours. In particular, we must avoid a phenomenon: some people take the opportunity of opening the ban to produce shoddy works (which is the real enemy of art), rush to put them on stage, with a "grab a piece" mentality, and even release poisonous weeds. In this way, the truly excellent and essential parts of the tradition cannot be better promoted, which is a loss to art. Some may say that I am conservative, but I think everything needs to start from a sense of responsibility, from the overall socialist premise, and there should be a certain degree of prudence.

　　Over the past twenty years, I have written some plays, but there are no printed copies. Due to the needs of the audience, they have been passed down by performers through oral instruction and have occupied a considerable proportion on the Henan Opera stage; however, local troupes have also given different degrees of supplementation and distortion in the performances because there are no fixed scripts. These plays were once called "Fan plays" and were discriminated against, although not explicitly "banned" but actually treated as banned, and were driven off the stage. However, some of them are quite popular with the audience, so today, when the ban is lifted, I heard that some places are rushing to perform them. I am the original author of these plays, and I may be somewhat biased, but today, looking at these plays, I myself admit that there are more or less problems and shortcomings in them. In the future, I will spend some effort: based on the identification of the masses and the opinions of experts, I will sort them out. Before they are sorted out, I suggest that colleagues and artists who perform these plays should proceed with caution. And I hope to convey the opinions of the audience and experts to me, so that I can better sort out these plays.

### 开“禁”有感

　　开“禁”有感
　　樊粹庭
    在鸣放声中，文化部开放了“禁戏”，许多剧目，能得以在舞台上重现，对艺人来说，从思想上给予以一种开朗的感觉，因而激发了他们的积极性。这是一个极为英明的措施，应该被肯定而且受到拥护。
    但也有些人认为：既有今日的“开”，当初就何必“禁”？可见以前那一阶段是完全做错了。我觉得这种看法是不正确的。姑无论“禁”与“开”都应该适应环境：在刚解放后艺人认识不足、群众辨别不清的时候，避免造成视听上的混淆，可以有一定程度的限制；当艺人已有了认识、群众能分辨好恶的时候，就需要完全摊开让观众自由抉择，以确定这些戏的真正价值。另外，我们不能否认以前的“清规戒律”和某些文艺干部的作风所带来的损害，但也不能完全无视于七年来戏曲事业的飞跃发展，更不能因为在发展过程中所表现的一些不能令人满意的、粗暴的地方，而认为共产党领导得完全要不得。试问：艺人的翻身，民间艺术的被重视，地方剧种的发展，戏曲的免税，对老艺人的救济，对戏曲艺术团体的帮助等等……难道是国民党政府留下来的吗？打个比方：盖好的洋楼漏雨，那只应该是“盖”的问题，决不能说洋楼盖错了，还不如茅庵好。
    作为一个从事戏剧事业、工作了二十多年的人，我觉得“开禁”，是政府表示对艺人的绝对信任，相信我们艺人经过七年来的社会变革，政治觉悟有了提高，能够明辨是非和认识自己所处的地位。我们也就应该珍视这种信任，要善于选择：哪些戏是适合于今天、有益于人民的，哪些戏是和社会主义的道德标准有些抵触的，哪些戏是可以全盘往上端的，哪些戏是需要去芜存菁再向外拿的。固然，鲜花毒草可以（而且也应该）同时并放，但若确确实实明知其为毒草，就不必再多耽误宝贵的光阴、浪费有用的精力，而多走弯路了。尤其要避免一种现象：有些人借开禁的机会，粗制滥造（这是艺术的真正敌人）抢时间往上拿，多少带些“抓一把”的心理，甚至竞放毒草。这样，就不能更好的发扬传统中真正优秀和精华的部分，对艺术来说是一种损失。可能有人会说我这是保守思想，但我觉得一切需要从责任感出发，从社会主义的大前提出发，应该有一定程度的审慎态度。
    二十年来，我写了一些戏，也没有印本子，由于观众的需要，经艺人们口传心授，曾在豫剧舞台上占了相当的比重；但各地剧团在演出中也因为没有固定的本子而给予不同程度的弥补和歪曲。这些戏，有一时期被称为“樊戏”而遭到歧视，虽未明“禁”而实际上受到禁的相等待遇，从舞台上逐出了。然而其中有几出颇受观众欢迎，因之在开禁的今天，听说有些地方也竞相上演。我是这些戏的原作者，可能有些偏爱，但今天来看这些戏，我自己也承认其中多少都存在着问题和缺点的。今后我将花费一些劳力：在群众下鉴定、专家提意见的基础上，把它们整理一番。在未整好以前，我建议上演这些戏的同业们、艺术家们，要慎重从事。并且希望把观众和专家的意见转达给我，让我能更好的来整理这些戏。
