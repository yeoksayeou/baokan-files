Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 19th: A modern, large-scale high-grade dye factory is under construction in Jilin. Once completed, the high-grade dyes produced annually by this factory will be sufficient to dye one suit of clothes for every person in the country.

Construction of the Jilin Dye Factory began two years ago, and several workshops will begin trial production in the third quarter of this year. The entire factory is expected to be completed around the end of 1958.

China was originally the first country in the world to discover dyes. As early as two thousand years ago, there were records of using plants as dyes. However, by the end of the Qing Dynasty, German chemical dyes monopolized the Chinese market. Later, the Chinese dye market was divided up by Germany, Britain, the United States, and other countries. Currently, in addition to vulcanized black and vulcanized blue, China can already produce more than one hundred kinds of dyes, but needs about four hundred kinds; many dyes, especially high-grade dyes, almost entirely rely on imports. In recent years, the foreign exchange used to import dyes each year is almost equivalent to the total investment in constructing the Jilin Dye Factory. After the Jilin Dye Factory goes into production, the several major dyes and several major dye intermediates can basically meet the needs of the whole country.

　　吉林染料厂每年生产的高级染料
    可供全国每人染一套衣服
    据新华社吉林19日电　一座现代化的大型高级染料厂正在吉林兴建。这个工厂建成后，每年所生产的高级染料能供全国人民每人染一套衣服。
    吉林染料厂在两年以前就已经动工，今年第三季度将有几个车间开始进行试生产。全厂大约在1958年年底前后建成。
    我国本来是世界上最早发现染料的国家，早在两千多年以前就有关于用植物作染料的记载。但是到了清朝末年，德国的化学染料独占了中国市场。以后，中国染料市场又被德、英、美等国瓜分。目前，除了硫化青、硫化蓝以外，我国已经能生产一百多种染料，但是需要约四百多种；有许多染料，特别是高级染料，几乎都是依靠进口。近几年来，每年进口染料所用的外汇差不多相当于建设吉林染料厂的总投资。吉林染料厂投入生产以后，几种主要染料和几种主要染料中间体，就可以基本上满足全国需要。
