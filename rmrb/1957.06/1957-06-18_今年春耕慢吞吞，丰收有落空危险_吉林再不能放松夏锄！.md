Changchun dispatch from our newspaper, June 17th: Whether Jilin Province can achieve a bumper harvest this year depends on how well the summer weeding work is done in the future. The reason for raising this issue now is that the spring planting progress in some areas of Jilin Province this year has been slow, and the quality is not good enough. It is understood that the plowing time throughout the province is generally about ten days later than in previous years. About 10% of agricultural cooperatives in the province did not finish their spring planting work until after the Grain Full (芒种) solar term. Because the plowing time was too late, planting had to be rushed, which affected the quality. Phenomena such as missing seedlings and broken rows have appeared in many places. In Liangjiazi Township, Huaide County, 23 hectares of the 130 hectares of sorghum land that had already been planted were missing seedlings and had broken rows. Some agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly understood the principle of adapting to local conditions and did not actively promote advanced experience in increasing production. According to statistics from fifteen counties, the area plowed in the spring using new farm tools this year is only about 10% of the area plowed in the spring last year. In addition, insufficient base fertilizer is also a common shortcoming.

Jilin Province has failed to complete its grain production tasks for four consecutive years. This year, it plans to produce six million tons of grain. Striving to complete this task is an important material foundation for resolving internal contradictions in rural areas. But now some people think that "the rainfall is good this year" and that "there is no big problem with a bumper harvest," and they are relaxing their leadership over summer weeding work. This is a very harmful and paralyzing idea.

The main difficulties in doing a good job in summer weeding work at present are: on the one hand, summer weeding production is very heavy, and on the other hand, there is a shortage of labor and animal power. Taking Dehui County as an example, the labor force participating in dike construction, working as temporary workers in forest areas, and flowing into cities accounts for almost one-seventh of the county's total labor force; on average, each animal has to bear the burden of five hectares of land, and some townships even bear seven hectares of land. How to solve this difficulty? The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jilin Provincial People's Committee have put forward some measures, mainly requiring agricultural cooperatives in various places to do a good job in summer weeding operation plans, strengthen seasonal labor planning and small-scale work plans, and minimize idle time and absenteeism, and carry out "full attendance" competitions. During the summer weeding period, it is especially important to carefully handle the contradictions between agriculture and sideline occupations, and between collective labor and the labor of commune members' families. Vigorously mobilize women, the elderly, children and other semi-laborers to participate in summer weeding production. It is also necessary to organize all the labor force in towns and cities that can engage in production to invest in summer weeding production. Cooperatives with insufficient animal power should select some non-draft animals that can be used, and strengthen feeding and management.

### 今年春耕慢吞吞，丰收有落空危险　吉林再不能放松夏锄！

　　今年春耕慢吞吞，丰收有落空危险
　　吉林再不能放松夏锄！
    本报长春17日电　吉林省农村今年能不能获得大丰收，就要看今后夏锄工作做得怎么样了。目前所以要提出这个问题，是因为吉林省今年部分地区春播工作进度迟缓，质量也不够好。据了解，今年全省开犁时间，一般要比往年晚十天左右。全省大约有10％左右农业合作社的春播工作，一直拖到芒种以后，方告结束。因为开犁时间过晚，只好抢种，也影响质量。不少地方已出现缺苗、断条等现象。怀德县两家子乡在已经播种的一百三十公顷高粱地里，竟有二十三公顷缺苗断条。部分农业合作社片面理解因地制宜的原则，没有积极推广先进的增产经验。根据十五个县的统计，今年用新农具春翻的面积仅仅等于去年春翻面积10％左右。此外，底粪不足，也是个普遍的缺点。
    吉林省已经连续四年没有完成粮食生产任务。今年计划生产粮食六百万吨。努力争取完成这个任务，是解决农村内部矛盾的重要物质基础。但是现在有些人以为“今年雨水还好”，“丰收问题不大”，放松对于夏锄工作的领导。这是十分有害的麻痹思想。
    目前做好夏锄工作的主要困难是：一方面夏锄生产很繁重，另方面劳力、畜力不足。以德惠县为例，参加修堤、到林区当临时工以及流入城市的劳动力，几乎占全县劳动力七分之一；平均每个畜力，要担负五公顷土地，有些乡竟担负七公顷土地。怎样解决这个困难呢？中共吉林省委和吉林省人民委员会已经提出一些措施，主要是要求各地农业合作社做好夏锄作业计划，加强季节的劳动规划和小段计划工作，尽量减少窝工、旷工，开展“满勤”竞赛。在夏锄期间，特别要认真处理农业与副业、集体劳动和社员家庭劳动的矛盾。大力发动妇女、老幼等半劳动力，参加夏锄生产。也要组织各城镇一切可能从事生产的劳动力，投入夏锄生产中去。畜力不足的社，要挑选一些能使役的非役畜，要加强饲养管理。
