　　Oppose Bureaucratism, Strengthen Party Leadership
　　Zhang Xihua, Director of the Ophthalmology Department of the Fourth Hospital of Xi'an, Professor of Xi'an Military Medical University
　　In April 1950, one year after the liberation of Xi'an, I returned to the motherland and my hometown—Xi'an—from abroad, hoping to play a small role in the construction of the motherland. Over the past few years, I have personally witnessed the amazing achievements made in various fields under the leadership of the Party. I have deeply realized the greatness, correctness, and wisdom of the Party. In a letter I wrote to friends who were returning overseas students, I said: "I can swear to God, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been such a great political party in Chinese history that is so supported by the people! Unless you experience it yourself, you cannot imagine even a fraction of the achievements of the motherland's construction in the short years since liberation! Only by following the Party can we achieve victory!" As far as I know, this is a common understanding shared by all intellectuals with basic common sense and patriotic ideas.

　　The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao pointed out that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is our country's long-term policy. Recently, the voices of "blooming" and "contending" in Xi'an have begun to unfold, but I feel that people still have some concerns. I believe that for the masses to "contend" well, the leadership must first "bloom" well, rather than giving people the impression of being half-blooming and half-withdrawing. Only by sincerely laying out the problems can they be handled correctly. Any concern about the disorder caused by blooming is a misunderstanding of the strong desire of the broad masses to take the socialist road and a disbelief in the masses' performance.

　　In 1950, the Ophthalmology Department of the Fourth People's Hospital of Xi'an was established. At that time, it was a small room with a table and a chair, few patients, and no equipment to speak of. We worked hard from scratch, striving for the support of the Party, the cooperation of comrades, and the public opinion of the masses. In 1954, the ophthalmology department developed to forty-three beds, adding extra beds to forty-seven or eight patients, with a maximum of nearly 300 outpatients per day, becoming the largest ophthalmology department in Northwest China. However, in the process of actively carrying out this work, we offended leaders who were bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjective. They could not find reasons to oppose the correct demands at the time, so they took the opportunity to reverse right and wrong in the movement to attack us.

　　For example, after successfully learning the advanced Soviet corneal transplantation, blind people from all over the country who longed to see the light again wrote to inquire about medical treatment. Once, I went to Beijing to attend a meeting, and when I came back, I had accumulated more than 300 letters that I had no time to deal with. Under the circumstances of very tight teaching and medical tasks, I really needed to find an assistant. I submitted my opinion to the leadership, but no one was ever sent. In order not to make the patients wait too long, I had to dictate myself and have my wife write back. Who knew that the leadership questioned, "What qualifications does she have to reply?" (because she did not work in our hospital). So I had to draft the letters myself and hand them over to the office to copy and reply to the patients. Unexpectedly, within a few months, patients wrote one after another saying, "The previous letter has not been answered." Later, I found out that their letters had been suppressed and not answered. I once boldly criticized this bureaucratic style of not allowing others to do it while not doing it oneself.

　　For example, over the past few years, the Ministry of Health has transferred ophthalmologists (many of whom were attending or chief physicians) from Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces to our department for further study. We believed that it was an honorable task to train cadres for the country, so we asked them to go deep into the wards and be responsible for the treatment work with us. However, the hospital never found a place for them to live, so that when the patients were in pain at night, they could not find a doctor, and the doctors could not enter the hospital at night to care for the patients. Later, I suggested that they put up a camp bed in the outpatient department at night and put it away during the day, but the hospital leadership still did not agree. Later, the person in charge of the Northwest Health Department of the Party came to negotiate, but it did not work either. A whole year of study time passed, and the problem was never solved.

　　There are other such things. In order to better do the people's work, in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, I once reported to the Jiusan Society, the United Front Work Department, the Party newspaper, and the responsible comrades of the higher authorities that the hospital needed to eliminate sectarianism, bureaucratism, and subjective emotions. Therefore, the leadership was criticized by the higher authorities and made a self-criticism. Who knew that they held a grudge and waited for an opportunity to attack. In 1955, they concocted a strange logic: those who have different opinions on individual Party members are anti-leadership and anti-Party. Thus, they came to the conclusion that saying that the leadership is bureaucratic is anti-leadership and anti-Party, and saying that we found accommodation for intern doctors is deliberately making them dissatisfied with the leadership, which is also leading them to oppose the Party. The comrades in our department established an ophthalmology department with relatively mass belief over the years, and they said it was an independent kingdom and a small group. Carpenters, barbers, dental technicians, and electricians helped me complete some scientific research, and I invited them to eat beef and bread in soup once. This matter was also said to be a small group, and it was investigated for more than a year. From 1950 to 1951, at the invitation of Director Ye of the Health Bureau, I served as the medical director of the hospital. Later, because I was a non-Party member and had no power to perform my duties, I resolutely resigned and devoted myself to business. But they said I was deliberately sabotaging!

　　The Party has repeatedly called on specialized talents to train more cadres and should engage in teaching work, which is also the aspiration of every senior intellectual. Over the past few years, I have been working at both the Medical University and the Fourth People's Hospital of the city. I often feel that my body and spirit cannot support it because of my poor health. When the leaders of the Municipal Health Bureau invited me to work at the Fourth People's Hospital, I stated that I was willing to engage in teaching work. At that time, the hospital leaders did not agree to let me go due to work needs. Therefore, the superior leaders and the dean attached a letter to the employment letter as an appendix, stating that "there will be no restrictions on your stay in the future." But later they said: "How did you sneak into the hospital?" As a senior leader, it is really chilling to fabricate right and wrong like this and go against the Party's correct education. What is particularly intolerable is the use of power to force the masses to speak for him. When a surgical director and nearly sixty-year-old mass member refused to speak against their conscience according to the instructions of the leader, a Party member dean shouted: "We control the grain, even if you are a studying expert, we can starve you to death." Can such a bad ideological style build prestige for the Party? Of course not.

　　Fortunately, the Party and Chairman Mao are correct. Finally, the organization concluded that my work over the years was: having a sense of ownership and "independent thinking." The masses also elected me as a municipal, provincial, and national advanced health worker (in fact, I don't think I deserve it). This is the Party and the government's cultivation and education of me. But I think that those people's violation of the Party's ideological style is intolerable and should be exposed.

　　To resolve contradictions among the people, we must use the method of gentle breeze and drizzle, which I fully agree with. Many good leading comrades have worked hard and are bureaucratic, and their essence and wishes are good. Seeing their hard work, we feel that even "gentle breeze and drizzle" is a bit too heavy for them. But for some people who have always used their power, violated laws and regulations, used public office for private gain, and even violated human rights and undermined the Constitution, if they are not investigated and dealt with, or treated with gentle breeze and drizzle, it will not be convincing. At present, the higher-level Party and government have also dealt with individual people, but mainly by transferring them to a higher leading position. This shows that there is still some unclear understanding, and even some sectarian sentiments of "saving face." This sentiment is likely to directly cause the following masses to feel uneasy and afraid to speak boldly.

　　To illustrate the difference between correct and incorrect leadership, here is an example.

　　Using artificial lenses to treat blind patients is a new scientific discovery in the world in recent years. In Xi'an, under very difficult conditions, I did not use the state's money. After more than a year of research, I successfully made it three days before the National Day in 1954, and cured a farmer who had been blind for more than ten years (who still has good vision after three years). Later, I performed surgery on nine other blind eyes, one of which completely recovered to normal, and six of which could see the words on the newspaper. During the operation, I reported to the leaders of the Fourth People's Hospital and the Health Bureau of the city, and also invited them to guide the operation, and wrote a written report. But they said to the higher-level Party committee: "Unauthorized development of new surgery without permission," so I did not get the support of the leadership. Finally, a technician from the Northeast came from thousands of miles to request treatment, but because the leaders did not look at it and decided not to allow it without research, they let the worker be discharged. The comrades of the Xi'an Military Medical University said: "Why doesn't Professor Zhang come to the Military Medical University to do it, so that we can also have the opportunity to learn." They then petitioned the responsible comrades of the Military Medical University to approve the worker's hospitalization, but on the day before the operation, the Health Bureau chased to the Military Medical University and did not allow it. At that time, I thought that since the Health Bureau did not allow the blind man's eyes to be restored, it was fine not to do it, but I had to explain the situation to the leaders of the Military Medical University. Unexpectedly, the president of the Military Medical University did not wait for me to finish speaking, and wanted me to accompany him to personally study and examine the patient, proving that this blind eye, which could not be treated in the Northeast Medical University, could not be cured without artificial lens surgery. The president of the Military Medical University immediately encouraged and supported me and said: "I support you to do it. If the city disagrees, I will reply to them." In this way, after the operation, the worker comrade's near and far vision completely returned to normal (now it has been more than two years since the resumption of work). Who knew that this would offend the leaders of the Xi'an Municipal Health Bureau even more? Four months after this incident, they held a struggle meeting against new scientific research. At the meeting, the director concluded: "Even if the success rate is 99%, we will not agree to you doing it!" Where is this something that a leader in scientific work should say? May I ask, who can make the most common appendicitis surgery 99% successful? Not to mention a new vision-restoring surgery? This attitude is actually stifling scientific research! It is true that our results have not reached 99%, but at that time it was still in the trial stage in the Soviet Union (and has now been initially successful). Not only that, these leaders also attacked all other scientific research (such as corneal transplantation, active artificial eyes, etc.), trying to find "medical accidents" from it to achieve the "punishment" of a few people's pre-planned private conspiracy. But under the correct leadership of the Party, they did not fulfill their wishes, and now these things are being exhibited as advanced deeds. Judging from the opposition and support for artificial lens research, there are two types of leadership, correct and incorrect. If it were not for the support of the president of the Military Medical University—an admirable leader—I believe that the eyes of that Northeast technician would still be blind.

　　Why is a new research hindered, even pursued? Why do you say that others have not reported it when you have personally seen the surgery and written reports? Is this just a general "ideological" problem? Some people say that the leaders of the Fourth Hospital of Xi'an in the past were nitpicking about cadres. I think it is more accurate to say that they deliberately reversed right and wrong. Their powers were very special.

　　Now the Fourth Hospital of Xi'an has changed new leaders. This shows that the Municipal Party Committee has some understanding of the above situation. Someone told me not to talk too much, but my words are by no means for certain individuals, but to use the facts to illustrate that the Party's launch of rectification today is necessary and timely. Speaking from the desire for unity, I hope that comrades will recognize the seriousness of the problem. Only by rectifying the bad atmosphere can we better engage in socialist construction. I also want to point out: now to oppose the three evils (the three isms), we must first oppose sectarianism, which is contrary to the intention of the Party Central Committee, because it is the protector and cultivator of bureaucratism and subjectivism. We must also fight against any tendency to abolish Party leadership, because the purpose of opposing sectarianism, bureaucracy, and subjectivism is to strengthen the Party's leadership and lead our 600 million people to a happy socialism better and faster.

　　反对官僚主义　加强党的领导
　　西安市第四医院眼科主任西安军医大学教授  张锡华
    西安解放一年之后，1950年4月，我抱着为祖国建设事业起一个小钉的作用的心情，从国外回到了祖国和我的家乡——西安。几年来，我亲眼看到在党的领导下，各方面取得了惊人的成就。我深深体会到党的伟大、正确和英明。我在同将回国的留学生朋友们写的信中说：“我可以指天发誓，以我所知，中国历史上从来没有这样伟大而得到人民拥护的政党！除非亲自体会是不能想像解放后短短几年中祖国建设成就于万一的！只有跟着党走，才有胜利！”据我所知，这也是所有具备起码常识和爱国思想的知识分子共有的认识。
    党中央和毛主席指出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是我们国家长期的方针。近来西安“鸣”、“放”之声初步展开，但是我觉得人们还是有些顾虑的。我认为要群众“鸣”得好，首先要领导上“放”得好，而不是给人们以半放半收的印象。只有把问题真诚地摊开来，才能得到正确的处理。任何怕放乱了的顾虑，都是不了解广大群众坚决要求走社会主义道路的愿望，不相信群众的表现。
    1950年，西安市第四人民医院眼科成立了，那时一间小房，一桌一椅，病人少，设备谈不上。我们以从头做起的精神，争取党的支持、同志们的合作和群众的舆论。在1954年眼科发展到病床四十三张，加床到四十七、八个病人，门诊最高接近每日三百人次，成为西北最大的一个眼科。但是，在我们积极进行这一工作的过程中，曾经触犯过官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的领导者，他们当时找不出反对正确要求的理由，结果就在运动中乘机颠倒是非来打击我们。
    例如：学习苏联先进角膜移植成功以后，全国各地渴望重见天日的瞎子，都纷纷来信询问就诊事宜。有一次我到北京开会，回来后就堆积了三百多封信没来得及处理。在教学任务和诊疗任务十分紧张的情况下，我很需要找个助手。我把意见提给领导方面，但始终未派人来。为了不使患者久等，我只好自己口述，由我爱人执笔写复信。谁知领导上质问：“她凭什么资格回信？”（因她不在我们医院工作。）于是我只好自己起信稿，交办公室去抄复病人。不料在几个月内，病人接连来信说：“前信没有得到答复”。后来我才发现他们的来信被压，并没有回答。我曾大胆地批评了这种不许别人作而自己又不作的官僚主义作风。
    再如：几年来卫生部曾调了青海、甘肃等省眼科医师（很多是主治或主任医师）来我科进修。我们认为替国家培养干部是个光荣任务，因此叫他们深入病房和我们一起负责治疗工作。但是医院一直不给找地方住，以致病人晚上痛苦时找不到大夫，而大夫晚上关心病人进不了医院里来。后来我建议让他们晚上在门诊部搭一行军床，白天就收起来，但是医院领导上还是不答应。后来西北卫生部党的负责人来交涉，也没效果。整整一年学习的时间过去了，问题始终没有解决。
    这样的事情还有。为了更好的作好人民事业，我本着知无不言的精神，曾经向九三学社、统战部、党报和上级负责同志反映医院里需要消除宗派主义、官僚主义和主观主义的情绪，因此领导上受到了上级的批评并作过检讨。谁知他们记恨在心，待机发作。在1955年，他们杜撰了一种奇怪的逻辑：对个别党员的看法有不同意见的人，就是反领导、反党。因而得出结论：说过领导有官僚主义就是反领导和反党，说我们为实习大夫找住处是有意叫他们对领导不满，也就是带领他们反党。我们科内同志在几年中建立了一个比较有群众信仰的眼科，他们就说是独立王国、小集团。木工、理发师、牙科技师和电工等帮助我完成一些科学性研究，我请他们吃过一次牛肉泡馍。这事也被说成为搞小集团，一直追查一年多。1950年到1951年，在卫生局叶局长邀请下，我担任过医务院长，后来因为自己是党外人士，执行职务有职无权，困难重重，就坚决辞去，专心致力于业务。但他们说我居心破坏！
    党一再号召专门人材要多培养干部，应当从事教学工作，这也是每一个高级知识分子的志愿。几年来，我一直兼作医科大学和市第四人民医院两处工作，自己身体不好，常感到身体精神都不能支持。市卫生局领导上邀请我到第四人民医院工作时，我曾说明愿意搞教学工作。当时医院领导上因工作需要不同意我走，因此上级领导和院长曾在聘书之外，附有一封作为聘书附件，说明“关于你的去留问题，以后不受任何限制”。但后来他们又说：“你是怎样混进医院的？”作为一个高级领导人员，这样出尔反尔的捏造是非，真是令人寒心。这和党的正确教育简直是完全背道而驰。特别令人不能容忍的是：利用职权，强迫群众替他说话。当一位外科主任和近六十岁的群众不愿按照领导的指使来昧心说话时，一位党员院长竟然大叫：“我们掌握了粮食，即或你是什么留学专家，叫你饿死你就得饿死。”这种恶劣的思想作风能给党建立威信吗？当然不能。
    幸而党和毛主席是正确的，最后组织上对我几年来的工作结论为：有主人翁观点和“独立思考”。群众还选我为市、省、全国卫生先进工作者（实在说，我自己觉得是不配的）。这是党和政府对我的培养和教育。但我认为那些人的违反党的思想作风是不能容忍的，应该予以揭露。
    解决人民内部矛盾，要用和风细雨的办法来解决，我完全赞成。很多好的领导同志，他们有辛辛苦苦的官僚主义，他们的本质和愿望是好的。看到他们的辛苦，我们觉得就是“和风细雨”对他们也有些重了。但是对有些一贯利用职权，违法乱纪，以公报私，甚至侵犯人权，破坏宪法等行为的人，如果不加查明处理，或以和风细雨待之，就不能令人心悦诚服。目前，上级党、政虽也处理了个别的人，但主要只是调换一个更高的领导位置。这说明还有些认识不清，甚至还有些“碍面子”的宗派情绪。这种情绪，容易直接造成下面群众的不安心和不敢大胆鸣的顾虑。
    为了说明领导正确和不正确之分，下边举个例子。
    用人工晶状体治疗眼睛失明患者，是世界上近几年来新的科学发现。在西安条件十分困难的情况下，我没有用国家的钱，经过一年多的研究，在1954年国庆前三天作成功了，治好了一位失明十多年的农民
  （至今已将三年视力仍好）。以后我又给九只失明的眼睛作了手术，其中一例完全恢复正常，六例能看到报上的字。做手术的过程中，我曾向市第四人民医院及卫生局领导上汇报，还请他们来指导手术，也写过书面汇报。但他们却向上级党委说：“未得许可私自开展新手术”，使我得不到领导的支持。最后东北一位技术工人，不远千里来要求治疗，但因领导上不去看，不研究就决定不准作，并让这个工人出院。西安军医大学的同志们说：“张教授为什么不到军大作，我们也好有机会学习。”他们就呈请军大负责同志批准那个工人住了院，但临作手术的前一天，卫生局又追到军大不让作。当时我想卫生局既不让瞎子的眼睛复明，不作也罢，但须向军大领导上说明情况。出人意料，军大校长没等我说完，就要我陪他亲自去研究检查病人，证明这只失明的在东北医大无法治疗的眼睛，非人工晶状体手术外不能治好。军大的校长立即鼓励和支持我说：“我支持你作，市里不同意，我去答复他们。”就这样，经过手术，这位工人同志的远近视力完全恢复了正常（现在恢复工作已两年多了）。谁知这样更得罪了西安市卫生局领导，在这事后四个月，他们召开了一个对新科学研究的斗争会，会上局长总结说：“就是99％的成功率，我们也不答应你作！”这那里是一个领导科学工作的人应当说的话？试问最常见的盲肠炎手术谁能作到99％的成功？何况一种新的复明手术？这种态度实际上就是扼杀科学研究！不错，我们的效果还没有达到99％，但当时在苏联还在试作阶段（现已初步成功）。不仅如此，这些领导者还曾对其他一切科学研究进行打击（像角膜移植，活动义眼等），想从里面找“医疗事故”，以达少数人预定“惩办”的私谋。但是在党正确的领导之下，他们没有完成愿望，现在这些事却被当作先进事迹展览了。从对人工晶状体研究的反对与支持来看，领导是有正确与不正确两种，假如没有像军大校长——一个令人钦佩的领导者的支持，我相信那位东北技工的眼到现在还是失明的。
    为什么一种新的研究会遭到阻碍，甚至追击？为什么自己亲眼看到手术和书面汇报，还说别人没有汇报过？这难道是一般的“思想”问题么？有人说过去的西安市第四医院领导上对干部吹毛求疵，我觉得说的更确切些是有意颠倒是非。他们的职权是非常特殊的。
    现在西安市第四医院已经换了新的领导人。这说明市委对上述情况已有所了解。有人告诉我不要再多说话，但是我的话绝不是对某些个别人而说的，乃是借着事实说明党在今天展开整风是必要的，也是适时的。从团结的愿望谈出来，希望同志们认识问题的严重性，只有整掉恶风，才能叫大家更好地从事社会主义建设。我还要提出：现在反对三害（三个主义），首先要反对与党中央意图相背的宗派主义，因为它是官僚主义和主观主义的保护者和培养者。我们还要向任何取消党的领导的倾向作斗争，因为反对宗派、官僚、主观三个主义的目的，是为加强党的领导，领导我们六亿人民更好更快地走向幸福的社会主义。
