Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) held a symposium on the evening of the 12th, where committee members voiced their opposition to certain fallacies within the CDL and engaged in debate.

Chen Wangdao, Vice Chairman of the meeting, said that the recently emerged arguments against the proletarian dictatorship, against the leadership of the Party, and against socialism relate to major issues of principle and must be contested. The CDL should both assist the Party in its rectification campaign and also improve itself.

Chen Wangdao also said: "Some time ago, there was an erroneous trend, as if the more radical the speech, the better. People insisted on saying there were 'walls' and 'ditches' even where none existed, and were setting fires everywhere. For example, when I made suggestions to the Ministry of Higher Education, I thought the school committee should be strengthened, but the Guangming Daily reporter changed it to abolishing the Party committee and published it in the newspaper the next day. This is truly an erroneous trend." He said that from the CDL member conference at Fudan University and from today's meeting, the vast majority of people do not approve of erroneous words and deeds; if there are any, they are only a very few. But because in the past many people stood idly by, not daring to raise correct opinions, it allowed erroneous trends to raise their heads. Now, righteousness is rising day by day, erroneous trends are declining, and those who originally had correct ideas dare to speak up. I personally believe that we can now compile information and opinions on helping the Party carry out the rectification campaign, and analyze and study them.

Wu Chengxi said that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CDL must have a unified understanding. First, the CDL is the Party's helper, not its opponent. Shen Zhiyuan returned from Beijing and conveyed Zhang Bojun's words, saying that the democratic parties should best develop one to two million people and establish some kind of upper house. This statement is in line with the thinking of getting out of the sedan chair and stepping down from the stage. He believes that in this struggle between the two lines, we must stand firm, proceed from the interests of the 600 million people, and the democratic debate within the CDL must be carried out even better, especially criticism from the bottom up can be launched against the leadership of the CDL.

Vice Chairman Chen Renbing made a brief self-criticism at the meeting regarding his past punitive ideas, etc., on the rectification campaign. Many people then stood up to criticize him and expose some of his remarks.

Wu Nan, a cadre of the CDL Municipal Committee who attended the meeting as an observer, said that Chen Renbing, at a cadre meeting two days ago, also said that he was very worried about the Party's rectification campaign, that the People's Daily should not be blindly trusted, that there was selective quotation in the workers' symposium, and that the current criticism of Chu Anping was unfair. Chen also said that he could not betray his conscience just because he was the Vice Chairman.

　　民盟上海市委会批判歪风怪论
　　大是大非非争不可
    会上揭露章伯钧的企图：民主党派最好发展一两百万人，搞一个上议院
    新华社上海13日电　民盟上海市委员会12日晚举行座谈会，委员们对民盟内部的一些谬论提出反对意见并展开争论。
    主持会议的副主任委员陈望道说，最近出现的反对无产阶级专政、反对党的领导、反对社会主义的论调关系到大是大非，非争不可。民盟一方面帮助党整风，一方面自己也应有所提高。
    陈望道还说：前些时，有一种歪风，好像发言越激烈越好，没有“墙”“沟”的地方也偏要说有，到处放火。譬如我对高教部提意见时，我认为应当加强校委会，光明日报记者却改为取消党委会，第二天就在报上发表了。这真是歪风。他说，从复旦盟员大会上、从今天的会上，绝大多数人是不赞成错误言行的，如有只是极少数。但因为过去许多人袖手旁观，不大胆提正确意见，使歪风抬头。现在正气已一天天在抬头，歪风下降，原来思想正确的，也敢于讲话了。我个人认为：目前可以汇集一下帮助党进行整风的情况和言论，分析研究。
    吴承禧说，民盟市委的认识必须一致。首先，民盟是党的助手，不是敌手。沈志远从北京回来传达章伯钧的话说，民主党派最好发展一两百万人，搞一个什么上议院。这种说法是和下轿、下台的思想一脉相承的。他认为在这两条路线斗争中，必须站稳立场，从六亿人民的利益出发，盟内民主争论还要更好开展，特别对盟的领导可以展开从下而上的批评。
    副主任委员陈仁炳在会上发言对他过去对整风有惩办主义思想等问题作了简短的检讨，许多人接着起来对他提出批评并且揭露他的一些言论。
    列席的民盟市委机关干部吴南说，陈仁炳在两天前的干部会议上，还说过很担心党的整风，对人民日报不可盲目相信，工人座谈会有断章取义的地方，目前对储安平的批驳有不公道的地方。陈还说，不能因我是副主任委员就昧了良心说话。
