No More Excuses
By Our Staff Commentator

　　In the disarmament talks in London, the Soviet Union has consistently done everything possible to promote the achievement of an agreement to satisfy the aspirations of people all over the world.

　　While the Western countries had not yet made a concrete reply to the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal of April 30, the Soviet Union proposed a new suggestion on June 14 to temporarily cease nuclear weapons explosions within two or three years. In this new proposal, the Soviet Union also stipulated the establishment of effective international supervision over the temporary cessation of nuclear weapons explosions. The Soviet Union's proposal is so practical that some people in the U.S. Senate are advocating accepting it as the first step towards achieving disarmament.

　　The immediate cessation of nuclear weapons explosions is the unanimous wish of people all over the world. Continuous nuclear weapons testing not only intensifies the nuclear arms race, but also the increase in nuclear radiation will cause serious harm to human health. Regarding this situation, authoritative scientists in many countries, including those in the United States, have issued warnings that cannot be ignored. People of all countries are becoming increasingly intolerant of the governments of those countries that are still unwilling to abandon nuclear weapons testing.

　　The Soviet Union has always advocated that relevant countries stop nuclear weapons testing as soon as possible and has made its own proposals many times. In the London disarmament talks, the Soviet Union further advocated that this issue be separated from the overall disarmament plan and resolved separately in order to avoid delays. However, Western countries, especially the United States, have been trying to delay by using the excuse that it is impossible to guarantee the cessation of testing without international supervision. Now, the Soviet Union's new proposal has stipulated specific measures for implementing international supervision over the cessation of testing. In this way, Western countries should have no more room for excuses.

　　The Soviet Union's proposal has been warmly welcomed by kind people all over the world. Because people have seen from the Soviet Union's actions a great hope for eliminating the threat of nuclear weapons explosions. At the same time, it is also an important action to promote progress in the London disarmament talks. Western public opinion also pointed out that this is a "significant concession" by the Soviet Union to Western countries and called on Western countries to carefully consider it.

　　But it is worth noting that, according to information disclosed by Western news agencies, the U.S. official is preparing to put forward a counter-proposal to deal with the Soviet Union's peace initiative. This counter-proposal advocates only temporarily stopping nuclear weapons explosions for ten months or a year. This kind of advocacy is not intended to stop the testing, but to use it to ease the pressure of public opinion so that it can continue the testing after preparations are mature.

　　The London disarmament talks have not made any concrete achievements so far due to the U.S. delay. This time, the Soviet Union has moved a big step closer to the demands of Western countries. If Western countries, especially the United States, are truly sincere in promoting an agreement on the issue of disarmament, they should show it in concrete actions: immediately accept the Soviet Union's proposal.

　　不能再推拖了
　　本报评论员
    在伦敦举行的裁军谈判中，苏联始终在竭尽一切可能来促成协议的达成，以满足全世界人民的渴望。
    当西方国家对苏联4月30日的裁军建议还没有作出具体答复的时候，苏联又于6月14日提出在两三年内暂时停止核武器爆炸的新建议。苏联在这个新建议中还规定对暂时停止核武器爆炸建立有效的国际监督。苏联的这个建议是这样切合实际，以致美国的参议院中也有人主张接受这个建议，作为实现裁军的第一步。
    立即停止核武器爆炸，已是全世界人民的一致愿望。不断进行的核武器爆炸试验，不仅加剧了核子军备竞赛，而且核子放射数量的增加，对人类的健康也将造成严重的危害。对于这种情况，许多国家的权威的科学家，包括美国的科学家在内，都已提出了不容忽视的警告。各国人民对于那些还不肯放弃核武器试验的国家的政府，已越来越不能容忍了。
    苏联一直主张有关国家早日停止核武器爆炸试验，并曾多次提出自己的建议。在伦敦裁军谈判中，苏联更主张把这个问题和总的裁军计划分开来加以单独解决，以免迁延时日。但是，西方国家，特别是美国，以没有国际监督就无法保证停止试验为借口，竭力设法推拖。现在，苏联的新建议已规定了对停止试验实行国际监督的具体办法。这样，西方国家应该再没有推拖的余地了。
    苏联的建议受到了全世界善良人们的热烈欢迎。因为，人们从苏联的这个行动中看到了解除核武器爆炸威胁的巨大希望。同时，它也是推动伦敦裁军谈判取得进展的一个重要的行动。西方国家的舆论也指出这是苏联对西方国家“有着重大意义的一个让步”，并且要求西方国家仔细地加以考虑。
    但是值得注意的是，根据西方国家的通讯社透露的消息，美国官方已在准备提出一个反建议，来应付苏联的和平倡议。这个反建议主张只暂时停止核武器爆炸十个月或一年。这种主张根本不是想停止爆炸试验，而是想借此缓和一下舆论的压力，以便在准备成熟后继续进行爆炸试验。
    伦敦裁军谈判由于美国拖延，至今还没有取得任何具体的成就。这一次苏联又向西方国家的主张靠近了一大步，西方国家，特别是美国，如果它们真有促进裁军问题达成协议的诚意的话，就应该表现在具体的行动上：立即接受苏联的建议。
