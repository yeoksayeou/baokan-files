Xinhua News Agency, London, June 1st: On May 31st, Britain exploded its second hydrogen bomb in the Pacific high-altitude area. The hydrogen bomb was dropped by a British Air Force Valiant bomber in the Christmas Island area.

Britain's first hydrogen bomb test, which aroused protests from people of all countries, was held on May 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: Hundreds of Japanese students demonstrated outside the British Embassy in Tokyo today, protesting Britain's second hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island. At the same time, some monks beat drums and petitioned, demanding that Britain stop hydrogen bomb testing.

The British Embassy's gate was tightly closed, refusing to meet with the demonstrating students. Japanese police guarded the embassy, preventing students from entering.

The All-Japan Student Federation announced this afternoon that it would launch a mass demonstration to protest Britain's actions.

Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: Students at Ryukyu University in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Island, held a regular student conference on May 31st to oppose the United States establishing "Nike" missile bases in Ryukyu and conducting atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, believing that the U.S. was preparing for an atomic war.

The statement passed by the student conference criticized the so-called "Education Ordinance" and "Anti-Communist Law" concocted by the U.S. occupation authorities as laws that suppress freedom of speech, publication, and thought. These laws not only "prevent" communism, but also treat those who demand the return of Okinawa Island to Japan, demand the defense of land from U.S. military base expansion, and demand the democratization of education as targets for sanctions.

    日本学生抗议英国再试氢弹
    琉球大学学生反对美国在琉球准备原子战
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：5月31日，英国在太平洋高空爆炸了第二颗氢弹。氢弹由英国空军勇士式轰炸机投在圣诞岛地区。
    激起各国人民抗议的英国第一次氢弹爆炸试验是在5月15日举行的。
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：数百名日本学生今天在东京英国大使馆外面举行示威，抗议英国在圣诞岛试验第二颗氢弹。同时，还有一些和尚击鼓请愿，要求英国停止氢弹试验。
    英国大使馆大门紧闭，拒绝接见示威的学生。日本警察在大使馆周围把守着，不准学生进入大使馆。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会今天下午宣布，它要发动一个群众示威，抗议英国的行动。
    据新华社2日讯　冲绳岛首府那霸的琉球大学的学生们，5月31日举行了定期的学生大会，反对美国在琉球建立“奈克式”导弹基地以及进行原子弹和氢弹试验，认为这是美国在准备原子战争。
    学生大会通过的声明指责美国占领当局策划出来的所谓“教育法令”和“防共法”是压迫言论、出版和思想自由的法案，这些法案不仅是“防止”共产主义，而且把那些要求将冲绳岛归还日本、要求保卫土地不让美国扩充军事基地以及要求教育民主化的人都当做制裁的对象。
