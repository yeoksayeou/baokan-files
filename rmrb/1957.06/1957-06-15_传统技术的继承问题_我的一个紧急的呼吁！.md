　　The Problem of Inheriting Traditional Techniques
　　——An Urgent Appeal from Me!
　　Zheng Zhenduo
　　We are now in a great era of building on the past and opening up the future. Many unique skills and talents passed down by our ancestors (that is, the hardworking and wise laborers of past generations) are on the verge of being lost forever with the aging and death of a few elderly technical experts, resulting in “the death of the person and the extinction of the skill.” We must quickly rescue those exquisite, useful, and beneficial techniques. If we do not do this rescue work today, we will regret it too late! We have many important arts and crafts that can be called not only the precious property of the Chinese people, but also the proud and glittering jewels of the world's humanity. For example, "Kesi" (silk tapestry), this most exquisite and beautiful silk fabric, has been a top-grade, supremely crafted work of art since Zhu Kerou of the Song Dynasty. Using warp and weft threads of various colors, a lifelike picture is carefully woven, requiring workers to work diligently for months, or even half a year or a year. The purple-based "Wild Duck Spring Outing" picture has been used everywhere as an "illustration" or brocade picture. Who knows that it was the creation of a Song Dynasty "Kesi master" seven or eight hundred years ago? Today, I was very happy to see that "Kesi" has been revived in a workshop in Suzhou and that there are already successors. However, I still feel that it is not valued enough. It is really unreasonable for a 70-year-old technician to sit at a small loom for eight hours (or even ten hours) a day, painstakingly threading silk. How should energy be used in more effective "guidance" of those coming behind? In the same workshop, there is also an embroidery department, and there are many problems, from the selection of materials to the selection of themes, which require careful research and participation by experts. "Song brocade," "Nanjing satin," "Zhang velvet," and other arts and crafts products similarly need someone to care about them. The trade departments only seek to produce good things, but there is no responsible department to care about guiding production and researching how to better develop and improve production.
　　Chinese "ink" is something that must be used for international signatures. It will never fade and is an essential daily item for artists at home and abroad. But it seems that good "ink" has not been produced for a long time. Our collection of ink is limited, but the overseas demand is endless. Collecting old ink for export is definitely not the way to go. We want to make good new ink to supply the needs of domestic and foreign markets. There are still some old ink-making technicians alive. A large number of people must pass on this technology.
　　There is also handmade paper. From various kinds of Lianshi paper, Maobian paper, Xuan paper to Liuji cotton Lianshi paper, Ripple paper, Henan cotton paper, etc., almost every place has its specialty paper. The raw materials are taken locally, and the technology is passed down from generation to generation. Not only has "Xuan paper" become an important material for the chemical industry (one of the best filter papers), but other kinds of paper also have their uses. The gold-threaded Ripple paper left over from the early Qing Dynasty, so delicate, so lovely honey-yellow color, simply makes people intoxicated at the sight of it. In recent years, in order to reprint some ancient drama works, the Commercial Press was entrusted to purchase a number of Lianshi paper. By last year, for some reason, the Lianshi paper from the Fujian area was simply slow in coming. This delayed the publication period by as much as half a year. This year, it is said that no Lianshi paper can be obtained at all. The reason for this is unknown. In short, it seems that the local area is unwilling to manufacture it (or it is manufactured for other purposes). I heard that there is news of the resumption of production of "Hang Lian." We hurriedly went to inquire, but it was a wild goose chase. Why is the production of earthen paper or handmade paper not valued? Who is responsible for this? One of the reasons is that some cooperatives do not allow farmers to engage in this sideline (it is said that a person in charge of a cooperative said, whoever wants to produce "paper" can eat paper). But more importantly, farmers cannot profit from this sideline, and sometimes even lose money. For example, the price of machine-made newspaper paper in 1934 was 4 yuan and 25 cents per ream, and in 1955 it was 22 yuan and 68 cents per ream, an increase of more than four times. However, the price of handmade Lianshi paper in 1934 was 9 yuan and 50 cents per ream (handmade Maobian paper was 8 yuan), but in 1955, the price per ream actually fell to 8 yuan and 70 cents (Maobian paper was also only 11 yuan and 88 cents per ream). Who can rescue this handicraft and support it? These handmade papers are extremely useful. Not only is it useful for printing ancient books, but it is also useful for artistic creators. If traditional Chinese painters cannot get good paper, even if they have great creative talents, they will have "no place to use their talents." For example, if woodcarvers use Chinese paper to print their woodcut paintings, they will show a different kind of splendor. Liuji cotton paper must be used to rub copper patterns and oracle bone inscriptions, but now that there is no Liuji cotton paper, the unique skills of rubbing copperware, etc., will also be eliminated. Henan cotton paper is no longer produced, then the small amount of paper used to mount the center seam of ancient books will also become extinct. Our Ministry of Commerce calls for the restoration of all varieties of famous wines in the country. Today, I am also calling here to restore the production of all kinds of handmade paper in various parts of the country!
　　Speaking of mounting ancient books, it is even more heartbreaking. Not many Chinese ancient books have been passed down to the world, and after all kinds of unspeakable disasters (including smuggling abroad and making "resurrection paper"), the number preserved today is really limited. More than half of the ancient books are either eaten by insects and gnawed by rats, scarred, or the paper is brittle and the center seam is cracked, and it feels like it will shatter at the touch of a hand. But after a good hand mounts them, they can be restored to their original state, and they can be read again. Isn't this giving new life to ancient books that are thousands of years old? Such skilled workers are not many now. For some reason, and I don't know when, the few remaining skilled workers were all sent back to their hometowns to engage in production. Last year, a batch returned to Beijing because the sale of ancient books was booming and they were urgently needed to bind them. This year, they were sent back to their hometowns again. More than half of the ancient books in the Shanben Department of the Beijing Library (that is, more than 100,000 volumes) need to be re-mounted before they can be read by readers. But the problem of binding workers has not been solved for several years. A "Zhao Chengzang" was soaked in water and turned into a cake, but only one worker was doing the repair work. A warm-hearted person exclaimed: "The People's Liberation Army used blood to protect the 'Zhao Chengzang,' are we just going to watch it rot?" This shout finally awakened the person in charge. It is said that measures have been taken to increase the number of binding workers. But what about the ancient books in other places? Are we still going to let them rot? The Beijing Ancient Bookstore has a great advantage, that is, if the book you sell has any damage or missing pages, they will try to repair it for you, or copy and match it well. This good tradition should be preserved. But where are the binding workers? There are still dozens of people in the countryside, most of whom are 60 or 70 years old, and they cannot do much work in the agricultural cooperative. Why not invite them to Beijing to do their specialty work, and they can also bring more apprentices, so that this unique skill will not die out in our generation? This is a win-win situation, and someone should be responsible for managing it.
　　There are too many of these unique skills and talents to mention them all at once. If we include the experts engaged in lacquer carving, ivory carving, cloisonné enamel, and even sandalwood fans and palace lanterns, the number of people is not too large, but the departments are really extensive. Can the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Handicraft Administration, and the National Native Products Supply and Marketing Cooperative, etc., spend some time to actively consider these issues? Don't push each other away and continue with that "master" style. All beautiful, useful, and beneficial unique skills and talents must be inherited. Not only inherit them, but also carry them forward. Being in a great era of building on the past and opening up the future, we have an unshirkable responsibility to carry on the past and open up the future. We will never let any beautiful, useful, and beneficial arts and crafts or any unique skills and talents die out in our generation!

　　传统技术的继承问题
　　——我的一个紧急的呼吁！
　　郑振铎
    我们现在是处在承前启后的一个大时代，老祖宗（也就是历代的勤劳智慧的劳动者）留传下来的许多绝技、绝活，眼看就要随着少数老年的技术专家们的衰老死亡，而“人亡技绝”了。我们得赶快抢救那些精工的、有用的、有益的技术。今天如果不做这种抢救工作，后悔将莫及！我们有许多重要的工艺美术品，都称得起不仅是中国人民的宝贵的财产，而且也是世界人类的可骄傲的晶莹的珠玉。像“缂丝”这个至精最美的丝织品，从宋朝朱克柔以来就是一种最高级的精工绝伦的工艺美术作品。用各种颜色的经纬线，细心地编织出一幅维妙维肖的图画，是需要工作者数月乃至半载、一载的辛勤苦作的。那幅紫色地子的“野凫春泛图”，处处都取来作为“插图”或锦图的，谁知道乃是七八百年前的宋代“缂丝家”的创作呢？今天我在苏州的一个作场里见到“缂丝”已经复活了，且已有了继承人，心里十分高兴。可是总觉得重视不够。七十多岁老技师还一天八小时（甚至十小时）地坐在小织机上辛苦地穿丝引线，实在太不合理了。应该怎样把精力用在更有效的“指导”后进的方面呢？在同一作场里，还有刺绣部门，问题也极多，从选料到选题都需要专家们的仔细研究和参加解决。“宋锦”、“南京缎”、“漳绒”等等工艺美术品，同样地需要有人关心。贸易部门只求生产出好东西来，却没有一个负责部门关心于指导生产和研究如何更好地发展和改进生产。
    中国的“墨”是国际上签字必须应用的东西，它永远不会褪色，也是国内国外艺术家们的必需的日常用品。但好像长久不曾生产过好“墨”了。我们的藏墨有限，而海外的需要无穷。收集旧墨输出，绝对不是办法。我们要造好的新墨，以供应国内外市场的需要。造墨的老技师，还有若干存在着。必须有一大批的人把这技术传授下来。
    还有手工造纸，从各种的连史纸、毛边纸、宣纸到六吉棉连纸、罗纹纸、河南棉纸等等，几乎每个地方都有其特产的纸张。其原料是就地取材的，其技术是世代相传的。不仅“宣纸”成为化学工业的重要物资（最好的过滤纸之一），其他种种纸，也各有其用处。清初留下来的金丝罗纹纸，那样地细腻，那样地可爱的蜜黄色，简直见之便令人心醉。几年来为了要影印些古本戏剧作品，曾委托商务印书馆购致了若干件连史纸。到了去年，不知何故，福建地区的连史纸，简直是姗姗其来迟。因之耽误了出版期至半年之久。今年，据说，完全得不到连史纸了。其原因不知何在。总之仿佛是当地不肯制造了（或者制造了另有用处）。听说，“杭连”有恢复生产的消息。我们连忙去打听，却扑了一场空。为什么不重视土纸或手工纸的生产呢？谁要负这个责任呢？有的合作社不让农民们从事这个副业，是其原因之一（据说有一个合作社的负责人说，谁要生产“纸”就让他吃纸好了）。但更重要的是，农民从事这项副业，无利可图，甚至有时还要亏本。像机制报纸的价格，在1934年，每令为四元两角五分，1955年每令为二十二元六角八分，涨了四倍以上。但手工业连史纸，在1934年每令为九元五角（手工毛边纸为八元），到了1955年，每令价格反而跌到八元七角（毛边纸每令也只有十一元八角八分）。有谁能够把这项手工业抢救一下，扶植一把呢？这些手工纸，用处极大。不仅印刷古书有用，对于艺术创作家们，也有用处。国画家如果得不到好纸，即使有天大的创作本领，也就“英雄无用武之地”了。像木刻家，如果用中国纸印刷其木刻画，是会显出其异样精采来的。必须用六吉棉纸来拓铜器花纹和甲骨文的，如今没有了六吉棉纸，连带的也便把拓铜器等等的绝活消灭了。河南棉纸不生产了，那末少量的装裱古书的中缝的用纸，也就绝了种。我们的商业部号召恢复全国的名酒的所有品种。我今天在这里，也呼吁要恢复全国各地手工造纸的各式各样的品种的生产！
    说起装裱古书来，更令人十分痛心。中国的古书流传于世的并不太多，而经过种种言之不尽的灾殃（包括私运出国和造还魂纸在内），今天保存下来的为数实在有限。有半数以上的古书，不是虫蚀鼠啮，伤痕累累，就是纸张脆碎和中缝裂开，几有一触手就会粉碎之感。但经过了好手装裱之后，便能整旧如新，焕然可以翻读了。这不是重赋千百年的古书以新的生命么？像这样的技术工人，如今已不多了。不知何故，也不知在什么时候，仅存的若干技术工人，都被赶回乡去从事生产了。去年回到北京城一批，因为古书买卖兴旺，迫切的需要他们来装订。今年却又被送回家乡去。北京图书馆的善本部，有半数以上的古书（即有十万册以上）需要重装，才能供读者们阅读。但几年来装订工人的问题始终没法解决。一部“赵城藏”，被水沾湿得成了饼块，却只有一位工人在做修复工作。有一位热心家叫道：“人民解放军用鲜血来保护的‘赵城藏’，就这样看它霉烂下去么？”这一声棒喝，方才惊醒了负责的人。听说已经设法增加装订工的人数了。但别的地方的古书呢？是否仍听之霉烂呢？北京古旧书店，有一个绝大的好处，就是卖给你的书，如有破损或缺页，他们会设法替你修补好，或钞配好。这个好传统似乎应该保存下来。但装订的工人们在哪里呢？还有几十个人在乡下，大多数是年已六十或七十，在农业合作社里做不动什么工作，只是成为“五保”的对象。为什么不请他们到北京城来，做他们的专长的绝活，而且可以多带些徒弟，不使这行绝活在我们这一代绝了种呢？这是两利的事，应该有人负起责任来管管方好。
    这些绝技、绝活，说起来是太多了，一时言之不尽。如果包括从事雕漆活，刻象牙，做景泰蓝，以至做檀香扇子，画宫灯的专家们在内，人数虽不太多，而部门实在广泛。文化部、商业部、轻工业部和手工业管理局、全国土产供销合作社等等是否可以花些时间来积极地考虑这些问题呢？不要彼推此诿，再那末“老爷”作风下去了。一切美好的、有用的、有益的绝技、绝活，我们都必须继承下去。不仅继承之，而且还要发扬光大之。处在承前启后的大时代，继往开来，责无旁贷。决不让一样美好的、有用的、有益的工艺美术品或任何绝技、绝活在我们这一代绝了种！
