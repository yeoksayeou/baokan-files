　　Doing a Good Job in Housework to Support National Construction
　　--Excerpts from Comrade Cai Chang's Speech at the National Conference of职工家属 Representatives

    At this meeting, everyone had a heated discussion about the significance of housework and its relationship with women's liberation, and about how to help the country overcome the difficulties in socialist construction. I would now like to share some personal opinions on these two issues.

    Housework is Glorious Labor

    With the change of the social system, and with the gradual realization of national laws in actual life, profound changes have taken place in people's ideology, habits, and social atmosphere. Discriminating against and insulting women is regarded as immoral; it is noble for men to respect women and for husbands to treat their wives with equality. Before the establishment of New China, our职工家属 and职工群众 were oppressed and exploited together, and our women had no rights or status to speak of. Now, in our families, we enjoy equal treatment and live a new family life of mutual assistance, mutual respect, harmony, and unity. In society, we are masters of the country just like men. Many家属 have become street cadres, jurors, and people's representatives. At present, the number of female workers in the country has reached more than three million, an increase of six times compared with 1949; including female members of agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives, a total of 113 million workers and peasants have participated in various aspects of production labor. A social atmosphere of protecting marriage, family, mothers, and children has been basically established.

    Chinese women have already been liberated, but does this mean that there are no more women's issues in our country? No. The influence of the ruling classes' exploitation over thousands of years on people's thoughts and habits cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. For example, the traces of inequality between men and women left over from the old society have not been completely eliminated; there are still remnants of discriminatory thoughts and habits against women in some people's minds; for example, as comrades have said, a few sisters are still subject to discrimination and abuse by their husbands, and may encounter difficulties in social activities because of the devaluation of women. At the same time, the level of economic and cultural development in our country is still not high enough. Under such circumstances, some special difficulties and problems of women have not been completely resolved. For example, women's cultural knowledge is still lagging behind that of men. These problems require long-term efforts to gradually solve. First of all, it is necessary to rely on the continuous development of the country's socialist construction, the continuous improvement of scientific and technological levels, and the further improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, so that women can gradually have the same opportunities for development as men not only in politics and society, but also in economy and culture. To achieve this goal, the efforts of women themselves across the country are especially needed.

    Most职工家属 are housewives who engage in housework. In the old society, the exploiting classes looked down on working people. Those who did not work and lived by exploitation became the upper class; those who worked hard all year round and created wealth with their own hands were oppressed and exploited and regarded as the lower class. Those who did housework were even more looked down upon. But in New China, the situation is different. The working people have become the masters of the country, labor has become the most glorious thing, and all labor that is beneficial to the cause of socialism is glorious.职工群众 participate in the country's socialist construction and work for the happy life of the people of the whole country; our职工家属 engage in housework and manage family life well, which is also a kind of labor that serves socialist construction and is necessary for socialist construction in our country. Therefore, it is also glorious labor.

    We know that when peasants and handicraftsmen were individual operators, their production labor was only for their own family, and the housework of their家属 was only to serve the people of one family; but when peasants and handicraftsmen joined cooperatives, their家属' housework was still for this family, but the production labor of their relatives was already for the collective labor, so the housework at this time became the labor of serving the collective. We also know that in the old society, having children was for the sake of carrying on the family line and providing for the elderly; now, we educate our children not only for this, but also to cultivate successors for our country's socialist cause! Because the social system has changed, the nature and significance of housework have also changed accordingly. Isn't this change and difference in housework between the old and new societies very obvious?

    Some people say that housework does not earn money, so housework has no meaning or value, and it is not as glorious as social labor. Is this view correct? This is looking at the problem superficially, not from the essence. Let's think about it: if职工家属 do not cook and wash clothes for职工, and no longer take care of children, and these things are all hired out, or bought to eat and wear, can they be obtained for free without spending money? Conversely, if职工家属 do not do housework in their own homes, but go to other people's homes to work as nannies or chefs, in this way, she earns a salary; but the family has to hire someone to do housework, and you have to pay her a salary. In this way, you leave your own home to do housework for her, and she leaves her own home to do housework for you. It seems that everyone earns a salary, but what is the benefit of this? Does this count as women's liberation? Nurseries and canteens serve laborers who are building socialism. Isn't cooking and taking care of children at home also serving laborers who are building socialism? The same food, the same clothes, are all for职工 to eat and wear. Why should there be a distinction between being glorious or not between cooking and making clothes in canteens and stores and cooking and making clothes in families? It is the same to raise the offspring of the working class. Why should there be a distinction between being glorious or not between taking care of children in nurseries and taking care of children in families? This makes no sense. When we go home from this meeting in Beijing, we must widely publicize this truth among职工家属 across the country, and also among职工 and in society: all labor that is beneficial to the cause of socialism is glorious and important. Everyone, no matter what position they are in, whether in the position of production labor in factories and mines, in the position of social public welfare undertakings, or in the position of housework in the family, is glorious to work hard for the cause of socialism. Only those who have labor power but are unwilling to work and only seek enjoyment are freeloaders and are not glorious.

    When we say that the housework of职工家属 is glorious and important, it does not mean that职工家属 should not participate in social labor. 职工家属 not only have the responsibility to do a good job in their own housework to serve socialism, but also have the responsibility to actively participate in social labor within their capabilities to serve socialism.

    What is social labor? To put it broadly, in a socialist society, all labor that serves socialism is social labor; therefore, housework is also a part of social labor. To put it narrowly, so-called social labor refers to labor in collective production undertakings or welfare undertakings outside the family. In this sense, leaving the family and participating in production labor in factories and mines like 职工 is called participating in social labor; not leaving the family, but organizing家属 to unite and help each other, engage in sideline production, run kindergartens, run nurseries, and even run primary schools, etc., is also called social labor. Now our country cannot possibly require us to participate in production labor in factories and mines like 职工, but it is very necessary for us to promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance to actively participate in the social labor organized by our家属 themselves. If we think about it, isn't such social labor very important, very glorious, and very necessary for us to participate in!

    Here, I would also like to especially say a few words about the dozen or so male comrades present, such as Representative Li Changyan. You are people with correct thoughts and excellent qualities. When others were saying, "Men doing women's work will not succeed in old age," you bravely broke feudal ideas and took on the work that you should take on according to the situation of your family, helping and encouraging the production labor of female workers; you also took on voluntary work in the streets and contributed to the country. You have done a very good job. Not only should female workers thank you, but everyone should also respect you. Those who still despise women and treat their wives with inequality should feel ashamed in front of you. They should learn from you and change their attitude towards women.

    Strengthen Unity and Overcome Difficulties

    Since liberation, our country has achieved great victories in just over seven years. Now we are in an era of unity and prosperity unprecedented in Chinese history. However, our country is not without difficulties. What are the current difficulties of the country? The overall difficulty is that the development of production cannot keep up with the growing needs of the people's lives. The difficulties that家属 sisters come into contact with include insufficient housing, shortages of certain non-staple foods, and the inability to completely solve the problem of children's enrollment in schools, etc.

    Why do these difficulties arise? Is it because our production is developing too slowly? No, our country's construction undertakings are developing very fast. However, the people's living needs are growing even faster day by day. Taking the supply of materials as an example: in 1949, the annual grain output was only 210 billion jin, and now it has increased to 360 billion jin; an increase of nearly 150 billion jin, and the annual cotton cloth output before liberation was more than 55 million bolts, and now it has increased to more than 174 million bolts; but it is still not enough, why? Because the people's lives have improved, and they need to eat and wear more and better. China has a population of more than 600 million people, and if each person consumes one foot more cloth and one jin more rice, the total amount in the country is a very large number. The amount of consumption has increased, so it is a bit tight. Taking children's enrollment in schools as another example: before liberation, children of workers and peasants could not afford to go to school, but now many people are going to school to study. This is of course very good! But the number of students has increased so much that although many new schools have been established, it is still not enough. From these issues, everyone can see that these difficulties are difficulties in victory, difficulties in progress, and are fundamentally different from the difficulties before liberation.

    Happiness cannot fall from the sky; it must be created by labor. To live a better life, we must constantly expand production and construction. We must build the country through diligence and thrift, increase production and practice economy. Managing the country is like living a family life. We must be careful and calculate carefully, and we must make overall plans. We cannot only care about the present and ignore the future. Now the country's annual accumulated funds are only more than 10 billion yuan. If each of the 600 million people in the country spends 18 yuan more, this construction fund will be gone. If the accumulated funds are used to build dormitories, run schools, eat and spend them all, and meet temporary demands, then production and construction will not be possible. Then not only will we not be able to get future happiness, but we will not be able to maintain our current life. Of course, the country should still improve people's lives as much as possible, but people's lives can only be improved slowly, not too quickly. We must take care of the present and the future. This is the combination of the people's immediate interests and long-term interests.

    Sisters, you have introduced many ways to overcome difficulties at the meeting, such as uniting and helping each other, raising funds to build houses, solving some housing difficulties; reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables, raising chickens and pigs, solving some non-staple food supply difficulties; organizing savings mutual assistance, solving the temporary money needs of some people; organizing tutoring classes to solve children's self-study problems; massively running nurseries and kindergartens to supplement the inadequacy of state-run childcare organizations; helping and caring for each other in case of illness and childbirth; and many other methods. These undertakings run by you sisters are permeated with the spirit of overcoming difficulties through labor, and are permeated with the spirit of using the collective strength and wisdom of the masses to solve problems diligently and thriftily. These deeds that you have buried yourselves in hard work are precisely promoting the spirit of the working class's hard work, bravery, and selflessness, and embodying the lofty qualities of communism. With this precious spirit and quality, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and our socialist cause will surely be victorious!

    Now some people want to take advantage of some temporary difficulties in our victory in an attempt to undermine the victories that the people have already achieved. These are today's right-wingers. They close their eyes and say that the people's lives have not improved at all and are even more miserable than in the old society. They advocate canceling the leadership of the Communist Party, cursing the socialist cause, and advocating prolonging capitalist exploitation for 20 years. In the past few days, I have heard sisters angrily denounce these erroneous remarks with tears, and this irresistible feeling of indignation is only natural. We must never allow anyone to undermine the socialism that our working class has gained through long-term hard work, sacrifice, and bloodshed! We will never allow anyone to drag China back to the capitalist road and oppress our working class again! This is just their wishful thinking!

　　搞好家务劳动  支援国家建设
　　——蔡畅同志在全国职工家属代表会议上的讲话（摘要）
    在这个会议上，大家对于家务劳动的意义和它与妇女解放的关系问题，对于如何帮助国家克服在社会主义建设中的困难问题，讨论得很热烈。我现在就这两个问题谈一谈个人的一些意见。
    家务劳动是光荣的劳动
    随着社会制度的改变，随着国家法律在实际生活中的逐步实现，人们的思想意识、习惯、社会风气也发生了深刻的变化，歧视和侮辱妇女被看成是不道德的；男人尊重妇女，丈夫以平等的态度对待妻子，才是高尚的。新中国建立以前，我们职工家属和职工群众一同受压迫、受剥削，我们妇女更谈不到什么权利地位。现在我们在家庭里，得到平等的待遇，过着互助互敬和睦团结的新的家庭生活。我们在社会上同男子一样地作国家的主人。很多家属当了街道干部、陪审员、人民代表。现在全国的女职工已经达到三百多万，比1949年增加了六倍；连农业生产合作社，手工业生产合作社女社员，总计有一亿一千三百万工农劳动妇女参加了各方面的生产劳动。社会上保护婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童的风气已经基本上树立起来了。
    我国妇女已经得到解放，但是不是在我国就没有妇女问题了呢？不是的。几千年来剥削阶级的统治给予人们在思想习惯方面的影响，绝不是在一个短时期内可以肃清的，比如旧社会遗留下的男女不平等的痕迹还没有完全消灭；在一些人们的头脑中还有歧视妇女的思想和习气的残余；比如像同志们说的，少数姐妹还受丈夫的歧视虐待，在社会活动中还会遇到轻视妇女的困难等等。同时，我国当前经济文化发展的水平还不够高。在这种情况下，妇女们的一些特殊困难问题还没有完全解决。比如，妇女的文化知识，还跟不上男人。这些问题都是要经过长期的努力，才能逐渐解决的。首先是要依靠国家的社会主义建设不断地发展，科学技术水平的不断提高，人民物质文化生活水平的更加提高，才能使妇女不仅在政治上、社会上和男子有平等的权利，而且在经济上文化上能逐渐和男子有同等发展的机会。要达到这个目标，特别需要全国妇女自己的努力。
    职工家属大部分是家庭主妇，是从事家务劳动的。在旧社会。剥削阶级看不起劳动人民。不劳而食、靠剥削生活的人成了上等人；一年到头辛苦劳动，用双手创造了财富的人倒被压迫被剥削，被看成下等人。作家务劳动的人，就更加被人看不起了。可是在新中国，情况就不同了。劳动人民成了国家的主人，劳动成为最光荣的事情，一切对社会主义事业有益的劳动，都是光荣的。职工群众参加国家的社会主义建设，是为全国人民的幸福生活而劳动；我们职工家属进行家务劳动，搞好家庭生活，也就是为社会主义建设服务的一种劳动，是我国社会主义建设所必需的劳动。因此也是光荣的劳动。
    我们知道，农民、手工业者，当他们是个体经营的时候，他们生产劳动只为自己一家，他们家属的家务劳动，也只是为一个家庭的人服务；可是当农民和手工业者参加了合作社以后，他们家属的家务劳动虽然还是为这一家人，但是她们的亲人的生产劳动已经是为了集体的劳动，所以这时的家务劳动，也就变成为集体服务的劳动了。我们还晓得：在旧社会生儿育女是为了自己一家的传宗接代，养老送终；我们现在教养儿女就不单是为了这个了，还是为我们的国家培养社会主义事业的接班人呢！因为社会制度变了，家务劳动的性质和意义也就跟着变了。家务劳动在新旧社会中的这种变化、这种区别，不是很明显的吗？
    有人说，家务劳动没有钱挣，所以家务劳动没有意义，没有价值，而且不如社会劳动光荣。这种看法对不对呢？这是从表面上看问题，没有从实质上看问题。我们想一想：假如职工家属不给职工作饭、洗衣服，不再带孩子，这些事情都去雇人作，或者是买来吃，买来穿，不花钱能白白的得来吗？反过来说，职工家属不在自己家里作家务活，到别人家去当保姆、大师傅，这样，她挣了工资回来；可是家里得雇人作家务，你得给她工资。这样，你离开自己的家去给她作家务劳动，她又离开自己的家去给你作家务劳动，看起来，都挣了工资，可是这又有什么好处呢？难道这样就算妇女解放吗？托儿所、食堂是为建设社会主义的劳动者服务的，在家里做饭带孩子，不也同样是为建设社会主义的劳动者服务吗？同样的饭，同样的衣服，都是给职工吃的、穿的，为什么在食堂、商店里作饭作衣服同在家庭里作饭作衣服要有光荣不光荣的分别呢？同样是抚育工人阶级的后代，为什么在托儿所带孩子同在家庭里带孩子要有光荣不光荣的分别呢？这没有道理。我们这回在北京开了会回家，一定要在全国各地职工家属中，还一定要在全国职工中，在社会上广泛地宣传这个道理：一切对社会主义事业有益的劳动都是光荣的，重要的。大家不论在什么岗位，在厂矿企业生产劳动的岗位上也好，在社会公共福利事业的岗位上也好，在家庭中的家务劳动的岗位上也好，努力为社会主义事业而劳动，都是光荣的。只有那些有劳动力，而不愿劳动，只图享受的人才是吃闲饭的，才是不光荣的。
    我们说，职工家属们的家务劳动是光荣的，重要的，并不是就不要职工家属们参加社会劳动了。职工家属们不但有搞好自己的家务劳动来为社会主义服务的责任，同时也有在可能条件下，积极地参加社会劳动来为社会主义服务的责任。
    什么叫做社会劳动呢？说得宽一些，在社会主义社会中，一切为社会主义服务的劳动，都是社会劳动；所以家务劳动，也是社会劳动的一部分。说得窄一些，所谓社会劳动，就是在家庭以外的集体生产事业或者福利事业中的劳动。从这个意义上说，脱离家庭，和职工们一样地参加厂矿企业中的生产劳动，叫做参加社会劳动；不脱离家庭，而是家属们在家务劳动之余，组织起来，团结互助，搞副业生产，办幼儿园、办托儿站，以至于办小学等等，也叫做社会劳动。现在我们的国家还不可能要我们和职工们一样地去参加厂矿企业中的生产劳动，可是都非常需要我们发扬团结互助的精神，来积极地参加我们家属自己组织起来的社会劳动。我们想一想，像这样的社会劳动，不是非常重要，非常光荣，非常需要我们去参加吗！
    在这里，我还要特别说一说在座的李昌炎代表等十几位男同志，你们是有着正确的思想，优良的品质的人。当别人在说：“男作女工，到老不中”的时候，你们勇敢地打破封建思想，根据家庭的情况，担负起自己应该担负的工作，帮助和鼓舞了女职工的生产劳动；还在街道上担负了义务工作，为国家出了力量。你们作得很好，不仅女职工应该感谢你们，大家也应该尊敬你们。那些到现在还在轻视妇女，以不平等的态度对待自己妻子的人，在你们面前，应该感到惭愧。他们应当向你们学习，改变自己对待妇女的态度。
    加强团结  克服困难
    我国自从解放以来，在短短七年多当中，取得了很大的胜利。现在我们处在中国历史上从来没有过的团结兴旺的时代。可是，我们的国家不是没有困难的。当前国家的困难是什么呢？总的困难就是生产的发展赶不上日益增长的人民生活需要的困难。家属姊妹接触到的，有宿舍不够住，某些副食品脱销，子女升学不能完全解决等等困难问题。
    为什么会产生这些困难呢？是不是我们的生产发展得太慢了呢？不是的，我们国家建设事业发展得很快。但是，人民生活的需要一天天增长得更快。拿物资供应来说：粮食在1949年年产只二千一百几十亿斤，现在增加到三千六百几十亿斤；将近增加了一千五百亿斤，棉布在解放前年产五千五百多万匹，现在增加到一亿七千四百多万匹；可是还觉得不够用，为什么呢？因为人民生活改善了，吃的穿的都要多些，好些。我国六亿多人口，每人多消耗一尺布，一斤米，全国加起来就是个很大的数字，消耗量增加了，所以就有点紧张。再拿子女升学来说：解放以前工农子弟上不起学，现在很多人都上学读书了。这当然好得很！但学生增加得多，尽管新建立的学校不少，也还是觉得不够。从这些问题看起来，大家就可以知道：这些困难是胜利中的困难，是前进中的困难，跟解放以前的困难根本不同。
    幸福是不能从天上掉下来的，要靠劳动去创造，要想过更好的生活，就是要不断地扩大生产建设。必须勤俭建国，增产节约。管理国家也像过家庭日子一样，要精打细算、要全面打算，不能光管眼前，不顾以后。现在国家每年积累的资金只不过一百多亿元，全国六亿人平均每人多花十八元，这一笔建设资金就没有了。要是把积累的资金都用来盖宿舍、办学校、吃光、花光，满足一时的要求，那生产建设就不可能。那就不光不能得到将来的幸福，眼前的生活也就保持不住了。当然，国家还是要尽可能改善人民生活的，但人民生活只能慢慢提高，不能提高得太快，既要照顾到眼前，又要顾到将来，这就是人民眼前利益和长远利益相结合。
    各位姐妹们在会议上介绍了很多克服困难的办法，像团结互助、集资盖房子，解决了一些住宅困难；开荒种菜，养鸡养猪，解决一些副食品供应的困难；组织储金互助，解决某些人临时用钱的困难；组织补习班，解决子女自学问题；大量办托儿站、幼儿园，补充国家开办的托儿组织的不足；生病、接生互相帮助互相照顾；还有许多办法。各位姐妹们办的这些事业贯串着用劳动克服困难的精神，贯串着运用群众集体的力量和智慧，克勤克俭解决问题的精神，这些事业都办得很好。你们埋头苦干做的这些事迹，正是发扬了工人阶级勤劳勇敢、大公无私的精神，体现了共产主义的崇高的品质。有了这种宝贵的精神和品质，就没有什么克服不了的困难，我们社会主义的事业就一定能胜利！
    现在有人想利用我们胜利当中的一些暂时的困难，企图破坏人民已经取得的胜利，这就是今天的那些右派分子。他们闭着眼睛说，人民生活根本没有改善，比旧社会还苦，他们宣传要取消共产党的领导，咒骂社会主义事业，宣传要延长资本主义剥削二十年。这几天来，我听到姐妹们对这些错误言论挥泪怒斥，这种忍不住的愤慨心情是理所当然的，我们工人阶级长期艰苦奋斗、牺牲流血换来的社会主义，绝对不能让任何人来破坏！任何人想把中国拖回到资本主义道路上去，重新压迫我们工人阶级，我们是绝对不允许的！这不过是他们的妄想！
