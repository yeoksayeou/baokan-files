Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: An American, named John R. Dawson, accused U.S. military personnel and their dependents stationed in Japan of their egregious behavior in the English-language "Asahi Evening News" on the 19th. Dawson wrote in the letter that after the end of the war, a large number of American officers and armed forces remained in Japan, not as capable leaders of soldiers, but as "parasites who live off the fat of this country."

Dawson said that a "large proportion" of officers in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are "living examples of dishonesty."

Dawson then pointed out that the quality of American soldiers stationed in Japan is "even lower than the quality of American soldiers in the past." He wrote that some people think that American soldiers are "troublemakers" and their "improper behavior in foreign countries" has left a bad impression on the local people.

The American also accused the families of U.S. military officers stationed in Japan of arrogance and domineering behavior. Dawson wrote: These American military dependents are "small people" from the rural backwaters of America, but when they follow their husbands to foreign countries, they become social upstarts in this country. The author said that these dependents become arrogant, hateful, and extremely rude to the people of that country. They treat their maids like slaves, and they inflict insults on all clerks and any foreigners who accidentally offend them.

Dawson concluded by saying that the U.S. military currently possesses colonies in Japan, not bases. In Japan, "the policies of these colonies are not executed by soldiers, but by henpecked husbands."

　　美在日拥有殖民地而非基地
    一美国读者投书“朝日新闻”指责驻日美军劣行
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：一个署名约翰·尔·道逊的美国人19日在英文“朝日新闻晚刊”上指责驻在日本的美国军人和他们的眷属的恶劣行为。道逊在信中写道，在大战结束以后，大批美国军官和武装部队一齐留在日本，他们不是作为军人的有能力的领导者，而是“靠揩这个国家的油水过活的寄生虫”。
    道逊说，美国陆军、海军、空军和海军陆战队的军官中占“很大比例的人”是那种“活生生的不诚实的榜样”。
    道逊接着指出，驻在日本的美国士兵的品质“比过去那些美国兵的品质还低劣”。他写道，有些人认为，美国大兵是“为非作歹的家伙”，他们“在外国的不正派的举止”在当地人民中留下了恶感。
    这位美国人还指责了驻日美国军官家属的骄横霸道。道逊写道：这些美军眷属是些美国穷乡僻壤的“小人物”，可是当她们随着她们的丈夫到了外国的时候，她们就成了这个国家的社会上的暴发户。作者说，这些眷属对那个国家的人民变得骄横、可憎和极端粗暴。她们对待她们的使女像对奴隶一样，她们对一切店员和偶尔冒犯她们的任何外国人大施污辱。
    道逊最后说，目前，美军在日本拥有的不是基地而是殖民地。在日本，“这些殖民地的政策不是由军人执行而是由怕老婆的丈夫执行的。”
