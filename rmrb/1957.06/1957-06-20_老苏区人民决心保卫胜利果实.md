The old farmer Chen Qinfang said: If anyone wants the Communist Party to step down, I'll fight them to the death!

Fuzhou, June 17th (Our Newspaper) – Our reporter interviewed the people of the old Soviet area of Dongxiao Township, Longyan County, Fujian, and they unanimously condemned the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the rightists.

Chen Qinfang, a sixty-nine-year-old farmer and former Chairman of the Huangbang Village Soviet, said: "In 1929, the Party led us to carry out the uprising, beat the local tyrants, and distribute land, and the people finally stood up. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the Party led the guerrillas and the people to crush the joint attacks of the Kuomintang bandit army and the landlord armed forces, and persisted in the revolutionary struggle. After liberation, the Party led the people of the whole country to build socialism. The Communist Party has always been for the country and the people. Even the three-year-old children here support the Party. If anyone wants the Communist Party to step down and make us suffer again, I will fight them to the death!"

Zhang Bingmu, an old Soviet cadre from the 1929 Houtian Uprising, recalled how his father was killed by the bandit army, his wife was forced to remarry, his children were sold, and more than 600 people in the township were sacrificed. He angrily said: "The Party led us to persist in the revolutionary struggle for more than 20 years. The martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for the sake of a happy life forever. We know how victory came about, and we know even more that we must resolutely oppose the anti-Party and anti-socialist plots of the rightists, defend the fruits of victory, and not let the blood of the martyrs be shed in vain."

Chen Xiangyu, a female deputy director of the cooperative, said: "During the 1929 uprising, I was a member of the Communist Youth League and my husband was a Party member. For the sake of the revolution, we lost two children. Many people risked their lives to send grain up the mountains and sheltered revolutionary comrades. We cherished the Party so much. Why do Ge Peiqi and others hate the Party so much?" Chen Tuanjin said: "Our Houtian Village suffered countless devastations by the reactionaries. More than 60 people were killed, the houses were burned down, the property was looted, and not even the chickens and dogs were spared. We endured difficulties, stood at the forefront of the struggle in western Fujian, and persisted in the revolution. After liberation, the Party led us to rebuild our homes, develop production, and improve our lives year by year. In the past, most people were short of food and clothing. After the establishment of the cooperative, 90% of the households increased their income. Last year, more than 190 households in the village sold more than 80,000 jin of surplus grain. The burned school was rebuilt, and more than 100 children went to school. Everyone is living a good life. Those who are anti-Party and anti-socialist should open their eyes and look at reality."

　　老苏区人民决心保卫胜利果实
    老农陈钦发说：谁要共产党下台，我拼着老命和他干到底。
    本报福州17日电　本报记者访问了福建龙岩县东萧乡老苏区人民，他们一致痛斥右派分子的反党、反社会主义言论。
    前黄邦村苏维埃主席六十九岁的老农陈钦发说：1929年暴动，党领导我们打土豪分田地，人民才出了头。红军北上抗日后，党又领导游击队和人民，粉碎了国民党匪军和地主武装的联合进攻，坚持了革命斗争。解放后，党又领导全国人民建设社会主义。共产党从来就是为国为民，我们这里三岁小孩都拥护党。谁要共产党下台，再叫我们受苦难，我拼着这条老命和他干到底。
    1929年后田暴动时的老苏维埃干部张炳木回忆当年父亲被匪军杀死、妻被强迫改嫁、孩子被卖掉、全乡六百余人牺牲时，气愤地说：党领导我们坚持二十多年革命斗争，先烈流血牺牲，就为永过幸福生活。我们知道胜利怎样得来，我们更知道要坚决反对右派分子反党反社会主义的阴谋，保卫胜利果实，不让先烈鲜血白流掉。
    女副社长陈香玉说： 1929年暴动时，我是共青团员，丈夫是党员，我们为了革命，失去两个孩子，多少人冒生命危险，送粮上山，掩护革命同志，我们是那样爱护党。葛佩琦他们凭什么这样仇恨党呢？陈团金说：我们后田村遭受反动派无数次摧残，有六十多人被杀，房子烧光，东西抢光，鸡狗不留。我们忍受困难，站在闽西斗争前面，坚持革命。解放后，党领导我们重建家园，发展生产，生活年年提高，过去大部分人少吃缺穿，办社后，90％的户增加收入，全村一百九十多户去年卖余粮八万多斤，被烧的学校重建了，一百多儿童上了学，家家都过好日子。那些反党反社会主义的人，要睁开眼睛看看现实。
