　　This newspaper reports: The Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory made full use of low-grade cotton in May, increased the spinning of 32-count yarn, and increased the weaving of 32-count warp and weft yarn fine cloth, producing a new product: double-sided twill fabric. In May alone, it saved 9,390 jin of yarn, and at the same time, the standard rate of cotton yarn was increased by 10% compared with the plan, and the positive fabric rate of bleached and dyed cloth was increased by 2.14% compared with the plan. Due to the expansion of the production of 32-count warp and weft yarn fine cloth, a large amount of raw cotton can be saved by using the same amount of cotton to produce 21-count warp and weft yarn cloth.

　　江西棉纺厂用低级棉织细布
    本报讯  江西棉纺织印染厂，5月份充分利用了低级棉，并增纺了三十二支纱和增织了三十二支经纬纱细布，生产了新产品双面斜纹布。仅5月份就节约用纱九千三百九十市斤，同时棉纱标准品率比计划提高了10％，漂染色布正布率比计划提高2.14％。由于扩大了三十二支经纬纱细布的生产，就可比用同样多的棉花生产二十一支经纬纱布节约出大量的原棉。
