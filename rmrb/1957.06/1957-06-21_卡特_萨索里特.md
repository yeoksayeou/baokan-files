　　Carter Sasorith
　　Katay Don Sasorith, who failed to organize a new Lao cabinet, is fifty-three years old. He was born on July 12, 1904, in Ba Sa County, Ba Se Province, in Lower Laos.
　　He studied politics and law at the University of Hanoi in Vietnam and later studied in France. He worked as a clerk in the French colonial government in Laos and as a professor at the Lao Institute of Administration.
　　In 1945, he participated in the Lao independence movement and served as the Minister of Finance of the Lao independent government. He went into exile in Thailand in 1946 and returned to Laos in 1950. In 1951, he was elected as a representative of the people of Ba Se and Chairman of the People's Assembly. Subsequently, he served several times as the Minister of Finance and Economy of the Kingdom Government, attended the "French Federal High Council" twice, and represented Laos in signing an economic agreement with the United States. In March 1954, Sasorith resigned from his position as Minister of Finance and Economy due to disagreements with then-Prime Minister Phouma, becoming the head of the government's opposition.
　　In November 1954, he succeeded Phouma as Prime Minister of Laos. The following year, he attended the Asian-African Conference as the head of the Lao government delegation. After his cabinet collapsed on February 14, 1956, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State in Phouma's cabinet. In August 1956, he accompanied Phouma on visits to China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
　　Sasorith is the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao National Party, as well as a shareholder of Thai Airways, which is controlled by American capital, and the Chairman of Lao Airlines, which is controlled by French capital. He advocates that Laos should be included in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, praises US "aid" as "indispensable military equipment" for Laos, and demands that the United States continue to provide Laos with military and economic "assistance."
