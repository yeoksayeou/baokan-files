    Prices Reduced for Fifteen Important Drugs
    The Ministry of Commerce has decided to further reduce the sales prices of fifteen important drugs, effective today. This is a result of the development of China's pharmaceutical industry in recent years, with these drugs being successfully trial-produced domestically, production quantities increasing, and costs decreasing.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Commerce has already reduced drug sales prices twice. In March, the prices of some drugs specifically for endemic diseases were reduced, and in April, the prices of contraceptives and related devices were reduced. The price reduction of these fifteen important drugs is the third drug price reduction this year. This price reduction, combined with adjustments to some unreasonable regional price differences, calculated based on the main production areas, shows that chlortetracycline powder is reduced by 24%, synnematin B capsules are reduced by 20%, glucose powder is reduced by 29%-33%, calcium gluconate powder is reduced by 36%, calcium gluconate tablets are reduced by 25%, isoniazid tablets are reduced by 11%, isoniazid injections are reduced by 13%, chloroguanide hydrochloride tablets are reduced by 15%, reserpine tablets are reduced by 30%, hexylresorcinol tablets are reduced by 20%, Agrimony pilosa tablets are reduced by 37%, ethinylestradiol tablets are reduced by 38%, phenytoin sodium tablets are reduced by 26%, penicillin ointment is reduced by 9%-23%, and vitamin K injections are reduced by 11%.

    十五种重要药品售价降低
    商业部决定自今天起再降低十五种重要药品的销售价格。这是由于近年来我国药品工业有所发展，这些药品在国内试制成功，生产数量增加，成本降低的结果。
    今年以来，商业部已经连续降低了两次药品销售价格，3月份降低了一部分地方病专用药，4月份降低了避孕药械价格，这次降低的十五种重要药品价格，是今年药品第三次降价。这次降低价格，并结合调整部分不合理的地区差价，按主要产地计算，金霉素粉降低24％，合霉素胶丸降低20％，葡萄糖粉降低29％—33％，葡萄糖酸钙粉降低36％，葡萄糖酸钙片降低25％，异烟肼片降低11％，异烟肼针降低13％，盐酸氯胍片降低15％，利血平片降低30％，己烷雷琐辛片降低20％，仙鹤草素片降低37％，乙底酚片降低38％，苯妥英纳片降低26％，青霉素软膏降低9％—23％，维生素Ｋ针降低11％。
