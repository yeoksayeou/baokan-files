    The Vice-Governor's Children
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xiao Huang
    The people here all unanimously praise the nine children of Lan Rongyu, the Vice-Governor of Fujian Province, saying that they have not lost the true qualities of the working people.
    On the eve of "June 1st" Children's Day, I went to visit this family with many children. Greeting me was their eldest daughter, Lan Delian, a junior high school student. This eighteen-year-old girl only came to Fuzhou from her hometown in western Fujian seven years ago, starting in the second grade of elementary school. Because her parents were engaged in revolutionary work, she had been fostered in other people's homes before that, and labored in the mountains from a young age. In elementary school, she was an outstanding "Three Goods" student and the captain of the school's Young Pioneers. Now she is the organization committee member of the Youth League branch in her class. Her teacher told me that she and her elder brother, Lan Min, were both recommended to junior high school from elementary school due to their excellent academic performance. Their teachers also said they are both good students who get along well with their classmates, and no one feels that they are the vice-governor's children and have any special status.
    Since her parents were not at home, Delian received me. She led me to the room upstairs, where her four younger siblings in elementary school were gathered around the table, reviewing their lessons. This room is Vice-Governor Lan's study and reception room. The furnishings are simple but very clean and orderly.
    I noticed the children's clothes. They were all wearing old and large, but very clean, cloth clothes. It turned out that most of their clothes were passed down from their older siblings. Only when they were too worn to wear any longer would they make new clothes, using the worn-out clothes to make shoe soles. Twelve-year-old Lan Qing proudly told me that he would learn to wash his own clothes this summer. His older sister and brother had long since washed their own clothes. Except for two younger siblings still in kindergarten and a small brother who was only two years old, the six of them made their beds, washed their bowls, and took turns going to the office canteen to fetch food every day. Once, ten-year-old Xiao He forgot to fetch the food and wanted the nanny to help, but his mother stopped him. From then on, no one ever forgot to fetch the food again.
    When I took out candy to offer the children, no one reached for it. It turned out that they had developed the habit of waiting for their mother or older sister to distribute it. Their pocket money was also regulated. Except for the older sister who received one yuan per month, the children in school all received five cents per week. Delian said that her mother recently told them to respond to the country's call for thrift and frugality and to eat less candy.
    In the open space downstairs, Lan Qing also led me to see the bean pods, balsam flowers, and roses they had planted themselves. He said: "These were all planted by us, and we also raise a flock of chickens!"
    When the self-study time from 7:00 to 8:30 ended, everyone played a spinning game. During the game, the siblings showed great love. Each time, they always let the younger ones play first, with the older brother and sister standing beside watching, cheering for the losers and applauding the winners. The older sister Delian told me that her parents never beat or scold their children. Even when the younger siblings made unreasonable demands in life, their parents patiently persuaded and educated them. Therefore, everyone is accustomed to living in a harmonious atmosphere.
    I asked about the children's aspirations. The quiet third sister, Lan Lan, said she wanted to be a doctor. Delian added that she would be graduating from senior elementary school this year. Her mother said that if she didn't get into junior high school, she would have to prepare to participate in labor. I asked, "Are you afraid of labor?" Delian said that her parents often told them stories of the arduous struggle during the guerrilla war era and often told them to compare themselves with the children of poor families. She said that their ideal is to create a better life with their own labor.
    At 9:30, the children's parents still had not returned. The three older children saw me out the door. They said that they would also hold a family tea party on "June 1st" Children's Day to review their progress and shortcomings in the past year and welcomed me to participate.

    副省长的儿女们
    新华社记者　萧璜
    这里的人们都一致称赞福建省副省长蓝荣玉的九个孩子，说他们不失劳动人民的本色。
    “六一”儿童节前夕，记者去访问了这个子女众多的家庭。迎接我的是他们的大女儿、初中学生蓝德莲。这个十八岁的姑娘在七年前才由闽西家乡来到福州，开始上小学二年级。因为父母参加革命工作，在这以前，她被寄养在别人家里，从小上山劳动。在小学里，她是“三好”优秀学生，全校少年先锋队的大队长，现在是青年团班支部的组织委员。她和她的大弟弟蓝民都是由于学习成绩优秀，由小学保送到初中的。他们的老师告诉过我，他们都是好学生，和同学们相处得很好，谁也感觉不到他俩是副省长的儿女而有什么特殊的地方。
    爸爸妈妈都不在家，由德莲接待我。她领我走到楼上的房间里，这时她的四个念小学的弟妹正围着桌子在温习功课。这房间是蓝副省长的书房和会客室，陈设简单，可是很干净，有条理。
    我注意到孩子们的衣着，他们都穿着旧而宽大、但是洗得很干净的布料衣服。原来，他们的衣服大都是姊姊、哥哥穿过的，只有当破得不能再穿的时候，才做新衣服，把破衣服拿去垫鞋底。十二岁的蓝清骄傲地对我说，今年夏天他就要自己学习洗衣服了。他的大姊和大哥，老早就已经自己洗衣服。除了两个还在幼儿园的弟妹和一个只有两岁的小弟弟以外，他们六个人每天都自己叠被子，洗饭碗，还轮流打扫房间，跑一段路到机关食堂里去打菜。有一次，十岁的小和忘了去打菜，想要保姆帮忙，被妈妈阻止了，从此以后，大家再也没有忘了打菜。
    当我拿出糖果请孩子们吃的时候，谁也没有动手。原来，他们已经养成习惯，要等妈妈或者大姊来分配。他们的零用钱也有规定的，除了大姊年长每月一元外，在上学的孩子都是每星期五分钱。德莲说，妈妈最近告诉他们要响应国家勤俭节约的号召，要少吃糖果。
    在楼下空地里，蓝清还领我去看他们自己种的豆荚、凤仙花和玫瑰花，他说：这些全是我们自己栽的，我们还养着一群小鸡呢！
    七时到八时半的自习时间结束了，大家玩起转盘游戏来。在游戏时，兄弟姊妹们显得很友爱，每次总是让年幼的先玩，哥哥和姊姊站在旁边看，为失败者打气，为胜利者欢呼。大姊德莲告诉我，爸爸妈妈从来不打骂孩子，即使有时小弟妹提出了生活上不合理的要求，父母也是对他们耐心说服教育，因此大家习惯于生活在和睦的空气里。
    我问起了孩子们的志愿。性格文静的三妹蓝兰说她愿意做个医生。德莲替她补充说，她今年就要高小毕业了，妈妈说，如果考不取初中，就要准备参加劳动。我说，你们不怕劳动吗？德莲说，爸爸妈妈常常讲过去打游击时代艰苦斗争的故事给他们听，还常常要他们和穷苦人家的孩子去比。她说，他们理想是要用自己的劳动创造更美好的生活。
      九时半，孩子的爸爸妈妈还都没有回来。三个大孩子送我出了大门。他们说，“六一”儿童节他们还要开个家庭茶话会，检查自己在一年里的进步和缺点，欢迎我去参加。
