"Going 'Left'" and "Going Right"
    Liubing

    In his written statement, Mr. Zhang Naiqi disagreed with others' criticisms of him (see the People's Daily, June 10th). He concluded by saying: "Don't be afraid of being labeled, and even less afraid of being attacked. The rectification movement, viewed from certain corners, will inevitably have twists and turns, and will inevitably have 'leftist' and 'rightist' deviations, but the Party will distinguish right from wrong. Right and wrong will eventually be clarified." Some of this is correct, such as "the Party will distinguish right from wrong. Right and wrong will eventually be clarified." Some people are counter-criticizing him precisely to clarify right from wrong. But some of his statements, when compared with the facts before us, seem to me to be "going right."

    For example, he said: "I feel that labels like 'resisting transformation,' 'departing from socialism,' 'departing from the leadership of the Party'… are somewhat excessive." This means that he believes that the criticisms leveled against him (and those who hold similar views) are excessively "leftist." He cited the criticisms of Li Kangnian as an example: "His (Li Kangnian's) suggestion is still intended to eliminate the bourgeoisie and remove the bourgeois label sooner; therefore, there is no reason to say that he wants to depart from socialism, but only that he is too eager to pursue socialism and wants to remove the label regardless of whether the conditions are ripe." "It is completely unreasonable to say that someone who is unwilling to be called a capitalist anymore is departing from socialism." This statement is truly wonderful: it turns out that Li Kangnian's problem is that he is going too "left" (eager to pursue socialism), while others are criticizing him for going too right (departing from socialism). Doesn't this prove that the critics are "left" on top of "left"?

    However, let us compare Zhang Naiqi's statement with Mr. Chen Shutong's statement below to see who is more in line with reality. "...At the same time, I also hope that the state will pay off the 20-year fixed interest in one lump sum, so as to remove the capitalist label. This kind of thinking that seeks both fame and fortune is pure bourgeois thought...." Is "seeking both fame and fortune" more in line with Li Kangnian's actual thoughts, or is "eager to pursue socialism" more in line with Li Kangnian's actual thoughts? This is not difficult to understand, is it! "Pure bourgeois thought" is of course going too right, but Zhang Naiqi still says it is going too "left." Doesn't this prove that Zhang Naiqi's counter-criticism is going right on top of right?

    Zhang Naiqi described those who criticize him as: "Taking the opportunity to belittle others to elevate themselves, seeking to benefit themselves, and exhibiting a 'I alone am loyal' posture. The thoughts of such people are worth examining." He also said: "When helping the Party carry out rectification... it is perfectly normal to only mention shortcomings and not mention advantages; it is even more normal to work with the Communist Party for a long time and speak frankly and 'get straight to the point' without starting with 'supporting something first.' None of this can be said to be 'departing from socialism' or 'departing from leadership.'" Here, Mr. Zhang is actually "honestly" confusing right and wrong. Who has ever said that "getting straight to the point" in criticizing the shortcomings of the Communist Party is "departing from socialism" or "departing from leadership"? However, distorting the "remolding" of bourgeois elements into "flaying and extracting sinews," demanding that the Party withdraw from schools and institutions, demanding that public representatives withdraw from joint ventures, demanding that Communist Party members and leading cadres "step down," etc., are these not arguments and demands that depart from socialism and depart from the leadership of the Communist Party? Some people have voiced opposition to these arguments and demands, pointing out that these are "departing from socialism" and "departing from the leadership of the Party." How could this be "belittling others to elevate oneself... seeking to benefit oneself?"

    As for "I alone am loyal," doesn't Zhang Naiqi also admit that more than 90% of the people are loyal to socialism? It is clear that there is no problem of "exclusive loyalty" at all. Would anyone not allow Zhang Naiqi to be loyal to socialism? Many people criticize him precisely to ask him to also be loyal to the people and socialism. But he describes those who are loyal to the people and socialism as going too "left," and does not hesitate to use words of "belittling others to elevate himself" to attack them. Doesn't this further prove that he is going too right?

    If we use the method of "pushing things a great distance away" to "deduce" whether the rectification movement will have "leftist" or "rightist" deviations, I am unwilling to participate in this kind of empty debate; but to summarize Zhang Naiqi's words as going too right is still fair.

### “过‘左’”和“过右”

　　“过‘左’”和“过右”
　　流冰
    章乃器先生在书面发言中不同意别人对他的批评（见6月10日人民日报）。最后他说：“不要怕扣帽子，更不要怕受打击。整风运动从某一些角落来看，肯定会有曲折，肯定会有过“左”、过右的偏向，但党是会明是非的。是非最后也一定会明的。”这段话，有些是正确的，例如“党是会明是非的。是非最后也一定会明的”。有人对他进行反批评，正是为明是非。但有些说法，要是同面前的事实对照起来，我看是“过右”了。
    比如，他说：“我觉得，‘抵抗改造’、‘离开社会主义’、‘离开党的领导’……一类的大帽子多了一些。”这就是说，他认为别人对他（以及同他持有相同观点的人）的批评过“左”了。他举出了人们对李康年的批评作例证：“他（李康年）的建议的用意仍然在于早点消灭资产阶级，摘掉资产阶级帽子；那就没有理由说他是要离开社会主义，而只能说他是过急地追求社会主义和不问条件是否成熟就想摘帽子。”“对于不愿意再被称为资本家的人反而说他是离开社会主义，那是无论如何都说不通的。”这说法可真是妙极了：原来李康年的毛病是过“左”了（急于追求社会主义），而别人却都批评他是过右了（离开社会主义）。这不是证明批评的人是“左”上加“左”了吗？
    可是，让我们把章乃器的说法和陈叔通先生的如下说法比较一下，看谁说的更切合实际一些。“……同时，还希望国家把二十年定息一次付清，以便摘掉资本家帽子。这种名利双收的思想，是十足的资产阶级思想……。”是“名利双收”更符合李康年的思想实际呢？还是“急于追求社会主义”更符合李康年的思想实际呢？这是不难理解的吧！“十足的资产阶级思想”当然是过右的，而章乃器还说它是过“左”的。这不证明章乃器的反批评是右上加右的过右了吗？
    章乃器把批评他的人说成是：“乘机用贬低别人来抬高自己的方法，以求对自己有利，表现了‘唯我独忠’的姿态。这种人的思想就值得检查了。”他还说：“帮助党进行整风的时候……完全可以不提优点、只提缺点，这是正常的；和共产党共事日久，说话不从‘拥护一番’说起，而是老老实实，‘开门见山’地说，更是正常的。这都说不上什么‘脱离社会主义’或者‘脱离领导’。”章先生在这里竟“老老实实”地混淆是非了。有谁说过“开门见山”地批评共产党的缺点便是“脱离社会主义”“脱离领导”呢？但是，把资产阶级分子的“脱胎换骨”曲解成“剥皮抽筋”，要党退出学校、机关，要公方代表退出合营厂矿，要共产党员和领导干部“下台”等等，难道也不是脱离社会主义、脱离共产党领导的论调和要求吗？有人对这种论调和要求，讲了讲反对的意见，指明这些是“脱离社会主义”的“脱离党的领导”的，怎么就会是“贬低别人抬高自己……，以求对自己有利呢？”
    至于说到“唯我独忠”，章乃器不也承认有百分之九十以上的人都是忠于社会主义的吗？可见根本就没有“独忠”的问题。难道会有谁不准章乃器忠于社会主义吗？许多人批评他，就是要求他也来忠于人民和社会主义。可是他却把忠于人民和社会主义的人，说成是过“左”了，而且不惜用“贬低别人抬高自己”的话去打击他们，这岂不是又证明他是过右了吗？
    如果用“一推十万八千里”的方法去“推论”整风运动会不会出现过“左”或过右的偏向，我不愿参加这种空头辩论；但把章乃器说过的话归结为过右了，总还是公道的。
