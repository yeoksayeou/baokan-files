Xinhua News Agency, 9th, Helsinki dispatch: According to a TASS report from Helsinki, the Finnish-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand mass rally on the 8th in Helsinki's largest "Massan" stadium to welcome Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Supreme Soviet Presidium Member Khrushchev, who are visiting Finland.

    Khrushchev delivered a speech at the meeting. His speech focused on the friendship between the Soviet Union and Finland and the establishment of good friendly relations between countries. Khrushchev said that in establishing good relations between countries, it is important not only to express feelings but also to conduct practical affairs. When the practical relations between countries are widely developed, political, economic, and cultural ties are strengthened, and the mutual exchange of trade and labor products is developed, friendship will be strengthened and consolidated. This is the necessary link to tightly connect the friendship of people all over the world.

    Khrushchev said that we always welcome the strengthening of peaceful mutual relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. All those who care about peace in Northern Europe will be pleased to see that the relations between the Soviet Union and Finland are based on the solid foundation of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance.

    Khrushchev expressed his belief that the Finnish government and the Finnish people will successfully promote lasting peace in Northern Europe.

    Khrushchev said, "We are against creating tension in any region of the world. We hope that all countries, large and small, will live in an atmosphere where they do not have to worry about tomorrow. We advocate maintaining peace throughout Northern Europe so that our land and sea borders become borders of friendship with our neighbors."

    Khrushchev expressed satisfaction with the good relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. He said that these ties are constantly strengthening. At the same time, Khrushchev emphasized that some neighbors of the Soviet Union and Finland are engaging in activities to prepare for a new war through various aggressive treaties and alliances, thereby threatening their own future. Khrushchev said, "We are doing everything possible to persuade these countries that it is best not to continue down this dangerous path."

    Several thousand people attended the mass rally, including the President of Finland, the Speaker of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finnish government personnel, members of parliament, prominent social figures, and residents of the Finnish capital.

    Before Khrushchev spoke, Mrs. Kilpi, Chairman of the Finnish-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered a speech welcoming the Soviet leaders and extending greetings on behalf of the Finnish people and the members of the association who initiated this friendly gathering.

    After the speech, a concert was held. Ballet artists from the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre, who are currently visiting Finland, and the Finnish Kullervo and Koitto joint choirs gave a joint performance.

    Xinhua News Agency, 9th, Helsinki dispatch, 8th: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Member Khrushchev, on the third day of their visit to Finland, toured the Finnish Gulf cliffs aboard the "Ariadne" steamer.

    This interesting tour lasted more than two and a half hours, ending at the Helsinki Olympia pier. As the ship docked, many citizens of the Finnish capital gathered at the pier to warmly welcome the Soviet guests.

    On the 8th, Bulganin and Khrushchev held a luncheon at the Soviet Embassy in Finland to entertain the Finnish President, Speaker of Parliament, and Prime Minister, among others.

    芬兰举行群众大会欢迎苏联嘉宾
    赫鲁晓夫强调在北欧保持和平
    劝告某些邻国不要通过侵略性条约进行备战活动
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬苏友好协会8日在赫尔辛基市最大的“大众”体育馆举行盛大群众大会，欢迎来芬兰访问的苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上发表了讲演。他的讲演着重谈到苏芬之间的友谊以及建立各国之间良好的友谊关系的问题。赫鲁晓夫说，在各国之间建立良好关系，重要的不仅是感情上的表示，而且是事务上的表示。当各国之间的事务关系获得广泛的发展，政治经济和文化联系日益加强，贸易和劳动产品的互相交换获得发展的时候，友谊就会加强和巩固。这就是把全世界各国人民的友谊紧紧联结起来的必要的环节。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们始终欢迎加强芬兰和苏联之间的和平的相互关系。所有关心北欧和平的人都会高兴地看到，苏联和芬兰的关系是建立在友好合作互助条约的巩固基础上的。
    赫鲁晓夫表示，他相信芬兰政府和芬兰人民将成功地促使北欧保持持久和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们反对在世界上任何地区制造紧张局势。我们希望，所有大小国家都生活在不必为明天担心的气氛中。我们主张在整个北欧保持和平，使我们的陆地和海洋的国境线成为同我们邻邦的友谊疆界。”
    赫鲁晓夫对苏联同瑞典、挪威和丹麦之间的良好关系表示满意。他说，这些联系不断在加强着。赫鲁晓夫同时强调指出，苏联和芬兰的某些邻国正在通过各种侵略性的条约和联盟而投入准备新战争的活动，从而也就使自己的前途受到威胁。赫鲁晓夫说，“我们正在尽一切可能来劝说这些国家最好不再继续走这条危险的道路。”
    参加这次群众大会的共有几千人，其中包括芬兰总统、国会议长、总理、外交部长、芬兰政府人员，议员，社会著名人物和芬兰首都居民。
    在赫鲁晓夫发言以前，芬苏友好协会主席基尔皮夫人致词欢迎苏联领袖，并代表芬兰人民和发起这次友好集会的协会会员向他们致意。
    在演说完毕之后，举行了音乐会。目前正在访问芬兰的莫斯科大剧院芭蕾舞艺术家和芬兰库累伏和科伊托联合歌唱团举行了联合演出。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基8日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在访问芬兰的第三天，乘“阿里阿德奈”号轮船游览了芬兰湾断崖。
    这次有趣的游览延续了两个半钟头以上，最后在赫尔辛基奥林匹亚码头上岸。在轮船靠岸时码头上聚集着很多芬兰首都市民，热烈欢迎苏联贵宾。
    8日中午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在苏联驻芬兰大使馆举行午宴，招待芬兰总统、议长和总理等。
