Central Committee of the China Democratic Party Continues to Hold Symposiums
Demanding That Zhang Bojun Expose His Political Foundation and Dig Out His Ideological Roots

　　This newspaper reports that at the enlarged symposium held by the Central Committee of the China Democratic Party on the afternoon of the 17th, the following issues were discussed: What impact does the serious political error committed by Zhang Bojun, as Chairman of the China Democratic Party, have on the China Democratic Party? What should the China Democratic Party do in the future? Is the reason for Zhang Bojun's mistakes simply that he "speaks too casually and disregards the impact"? After liberation, the political status given to Zhang Bojun by the people was not low, and the work entrusted to him was not light. Why did he instead appear so passive, even wanting to abolish the China Democratic Party? Later, why did he suddenly change and become "active," wanting to "achieve something" and "develop greatly"?

　　Zhang Bojun did not attend this symposium. According to Li Boqiu, who presided over the symposium, Zhang Bojun said he needed to take a nap, and would join after the nap. At the symposium, some people again requested that Zhang Bojun be invited to listen to everyone's opinions and called him; however, until the end of the symposium, he was not seen.

　　At this symposium, the first to speak was Yang Qingyuan. He said: Zhang Bojun has the idea of changing the political climate. What he said to Shi Liang concentratedly expresses this idea. Some people say he wants to "share the power equally" with the Communist Party, which is not enough to explain his ambition. Zhang Bojun has a serious "climbing up" mentality, wanting to lord it over the people.

　　Wang Yifan analyzed Zhang Bojun's various opinions, pointing out that Zhang Bojun's apparent aim of increasing the power of the democratic parties was essentially "increasing the power of me, Zhang Bojun."

　　He said that Zhang Bojun's mistakes are not accidental. He came from a landlord family, received a European bourgeois education, and was full of Western democracy. During the high tide of world and Chinese revolution, he joined the Communist Party; after the failure of the Great Revolution, he became a deserter and turned to Deng Yanda's third road. After Deng Yanda's death, the focus of the Third Party was placed on Zhang Bojun, and he exploited personal ambitions in political struggles. After the victory, he was a senior democratic figure, and successive social reforms and ideological transformations had nothing to do with him. He did not transform well ideologically, and was still essentially old stuff. When it was detrimental to his personal ambitions, he was passive; when it was beneficial, he became "active" again.

　　Pan Weiyao read out a resolution unanimously adopted by the China Democratic Party's branch of the Highway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The resolution stated: resolutely draw a clear line between ourselves and Zhang Bojun's erroneous ideas; resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party, follow the socialist road, and resolutely struggle to the end against anyone who wants to pull the China Democratic Party out of the socialist path. He said: Zhang Bojun wants to use members of the democratic parties as his personal political capital, he is completely wrong!

　　Huang Shenzhi said in his speech: Zhang Bojun's so-called political design institute must actually have a bottom line in his mind; he says "welcome criticism," but refuses to reveal the "bottom line." He thinks that this will negate people's criticism of him. In fact, people can know the essence of his thinking by linking what he has said and done in the past. Even if he tries to put on makeup before presenting it, the people will wash off his makeup for him.

　　Huang Shenzhi agreed with Shanghai Foreign Language Institute Professor Xu Zhongnian's evaluation of Zhang Bojun: "A deserter in the face of difficulties, a warrior in the face of fame and position." He used facts to illustrate this point, and pointed out that Zhang Bojun has boasted more than once that he was a "deserter of the Communist Party," not ashamed but proud.

　　Zhong Dai said that Zhang Bojun considers himself the founding father of contemporary democratic parties, believing that the Democratic League and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang were both established with his help, and referring to the China Democratic Party as "my small stall," regarding it as his political capital. Therefore, since liberation, he has considered himself not "successful" enough, constantly expressing dissatisfaction, being passive and depressed, saying that the Communist Party is unfair, and believing that: "Those who are not as good as me have the same rank as me, such as Zhang Xiruo and Fu Zuoyi; some people have higher status than me, such as Chen Shutong and Huang Yanpei, etc." Therefore, he indulged in calligraphy and painting, stroking antiques to pass the time. Zhong Dai also said that Zhang Bojun only pursues numbers in the China Democratic Party's organizational work, and does not rely on or cultivate progressive forces. Last year, when we proposed to distinguish members as "left, middle, and right," he strongly opposed it. He wants: the more backward members we have, the better. In the arrangement of personnel within the party, he has always proceeded from his personal relationships and personal preferences, regardless of virtue and talent, and uses those who can support him.

　　Wang Renxuan also analyzed the ideological essence of Zhang Bojun from the history of Zhang Bojun's participation in political activities. He said: Before liberation, Zhang Bojun's idea was to seek development in the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, hoping that the Kuomintang would fall but not fall completely, so that he could "reap the benefits." Wang Renxuan also said: Zhang Bojun's expression of willingness to humbly examine himself should be welcomed; but Zhang Bojun is not an honest person and is good at playing tricks. We must be aware of his personality and help him well.

　　Wang Zhenxin reviewed his mistake of supporting Zhang Bojun at the previous symposium, saying that this was only because his "political level was too low," his "emotions were impulsive," and his "understanding of the seriousness and harm of his mistakes was vague."

　　Wang Jiyi, Luo Renyi, Li Shihao, Zhuang Mingyuan, Zhang Hanqing, Zhang Yunchuan, and Yang Yitang also spoke at the meeting. Yang Ziheng and Ji Quan made written speeches.

### 农工民主党中委继续举行座谈会  要求章伯钧政治上揭底、思想上挖根

　　农工民主党中委继续举行座谈会
    要求章伯钧政治上揭底、思想上挖根
    本报讯　在17日下午举行的中国农工民主党中委（扩大）座谈会上，谈到了这样一些问题：作为农工民主党主席的章伯钧犯了严重的政治错误，对农工民主党有什么影响？农工民主党今后应该怎么办？章伯钧犯错误的原因是不是就因为他“说话太随便，不顾影响”？在解放后人民给予章伯钧的政治地位并不算低，委托他的工作任务并不算轻，他为什么反而表现得很消极，甚至要取消农工民主党？以后，为什么忽然又一变而“积极”起来，要“有所作为”，要“大发展”？
    章伯钧没有出席这次座谈会。据主持座谈会的李伯球说：章伯钧说他要睡午觉，午觉后可以参加。在座谈会上，又有人要求请章伯钧来听听大家的意见，并且打了电话给他；可是，直到座谈会结束，还是没有看到他的影子。
    在这次座谈会上，第一个发言的是杨清源。他说：章伯钧有变天思想。他向史良所说的话，就集中地表现了这种思想。有人说他是想与共产党“平分秋色”，这还不足以说明他的野心。章伯钧有严重的“向上爬”思想，想在人民头上作威作福。
    王一帆分析了章伯钧的各种意见，指出章伯钧在表面上是要加大民主党派的权力，其实质都是“加大我章伯钧的权力”。
    他说，章伯钧的错误不是偶然的。他出身地主家庭，受过欧洲资产阶级教育，满脑子西方民主。在世界和中国革命高潮中，他参加了共产党；大革命失败后，他又作了逃兵，投到邓演达的第三条路线。邓演达死后，第三党的重心放在章伯钧的身上，他在政治斗争中发挥了个人野心。胜利以后，他是高级民主人士，历次社会改革和思想改造与他无关，他在思想上没有很好改造，本质上还是旧东西，在对个人野心不利的时候他消极，有利的时候他又“积极”了。
    潘维耀宣读了农工民主党交通部公路总局支部大会一致通过的一个决议。这个决议中表示：坚决与章伯钧的错误思想划清界限；坚决拥护共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路，同任何想把农工民主党拉出社会主义的轨道的人坚决斗争到底。他说：章伯钧想把民主党派成员当作他个人的政治资本，他完全想错了！
    黄慎之在发言中说：章伯钧所谓的政治设计院，实际上在他的脑子里一定有个底；他一面说“欢迎批评”，一面却不肯把“底”讲出来。他以为这样就可以否定人们对他的批评。其实，人们联系他过去讲过的话、做过的事，就可以知道他的思想实质。他想涂脂抹粉后再拿出来，人民也会替他把脂粉洗掉。
    黄慎之同意上海外国语学院教授徐仲年对章伯钧的评价：“在困难前是逃兵，在名位前是勇士。”他用事实说明了这一点，并指出章伯钧不止一次夸耀自己做过“共产党的逃兵”，不以为耻，反以为荣。
    锺岱发言说，章伯钧自认为自己是当代民主党派的开山老祖，认为民盟、民革都是他帮助搞起来的，把农工民主党说成是“我的小摊子”，看成是他的政治资本。因此，从解放以来，他自认为是不够“得意”的，时时表现不满，消极苦闷，说共产党不公平，自认为：“不如我的人，官和我一样大，如张奚若、傅作义；有的人地位比我还高，如陈叔通、黄炎培等。”因此，他寄情书画，摩挲古董，以消闲岁月。锺岱还说，章伯钧在农工民主党的组织工作上，只追求数字，不依靠也不培养进步力量。去年我们提出区分成员“左中右”的时候，受到他很大的反对。他是想：我们党员落后分子越多越好。在党内人事安排上，也一向从他的私人关系、个人好恶出发，不问德才，能拥护他的就用。
    王人旋也从章伯钧参加政治活动的历史分析了章伯钧的思想本质。他说：解放前，章伯钧的主张是在国民党和共产党的斗争中求发展，希望国民党倒而不倒，他来“渔翁得利”。王人旋还说：章伯钧表示要虚心检查，应该欢迎；但章伯钧不是老实人，善于玩弄权术。必须知道他这个个性，好好帮助他。
    王枕心检讨了他前次座谈会上支持章伯钧的错误，他说，这只是由于自己“政治水平太低”，“感情一时冲动”，“对他的错误严重性和危害性认识模糊”。
    在会上发言的还有王寄一、罗任一、李士豪、庄明远、张含清、张云川、杨逸棠。杨子恒和嵇铨作了书面发言。
