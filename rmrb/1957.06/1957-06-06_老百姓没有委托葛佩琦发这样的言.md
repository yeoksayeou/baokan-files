    The People Did Not Entrust Ge Peiqi to Make Such a Statement
    I have different views on the speech made by Ge Peiqi, a lecturer in the Physical Chemistry Teaching and Research Section of the Department of Industrial Economics at Renmin University of China:
    I believe that some Communist Party members have shortcomings, even mistakes, in their thinking and work style, and it is necessary to carry out this rectification movement. However, we should also recognize that, as a ruling party, being able to so sincerely and humbly absorb the opinions of non-Party members to improve work and correct mistakes is something that no ruling class in Chinese history and no non-proletarian-led country can do. Therefore, I believe that, as a Chinese citizen, in this rectification movement, we should stand on the position of loving the Party, and with the spirit of unity—criticism—unity, offer opinions to the Party and help the Party to rectify its work, so that the Party can better lead us to build a communist society.
    However, I cannot find such a spirit in Ge Peiqi's speech.
    The supply of materials is currently somewhat tight because people's living standards have improved, and the supply of materials cannot keep up. However, this is a difficulty in progress, and everyone should help the country come up with more ways to gradually solve these problems. The country now exports more goods than before, but this is to exchange for other materials that our country needs more, which should be understood. As for the fact that there are too many people riding in small cars and wearing serge uniforms, it is indeed necessary to advocate thrift, but not all of these people are Party members.
    I think the statement that "today the people respect ghosts and gods but keep away from the Communist Party" is even more wrong. The people did not entrust him to make such a statement. I don't know what survey data his speech is based on, or which group of people he represents. Some Party members have shortcomings in their work of uniting non-Party intellectuals, but it does not mean that the people are alienated from the Communist Party. I am a non-Party intellectual of bourgeois origin who has suffered excessive struggles in some political movements, and therefore my thoughts and feelings were once very unhappy, but I have not developed the idea of alienating myself from the Party. I think the people have eyes, they have seen the past, and they have also seen the present, and their experience is very deep. Although they are temporarily suffering some hardships and are somewhat dissatisfied, they will also understand that life in the future will be better, and therefore they will understand the country's difficulties, and will never be like what Ge Peiqi said.
    In the last paragraph of Ge Peiqi's speech, he mentioned "If you are not good, the masses can overthrow you, kill communists, and overthrow you. You cannot say that this is not patriotism, because the communists do not serve the people. If the Communist Party is destroyed, China will not be destroyed, because even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will not betray the country." I think it is okay to say some angry words, but his words are filled with hatred. This is a threatening tone towards the Party, not an attitude of cherishing, not a spirit of helping. I completely disagree with this statement.

### 老百姓没有委托葛佩琦发这样的言

    老百姓没有委托葛佩琦发这样的言
    我对中国人民大学工业经济系物理化学教研室讲师葛佩琦的发言有不同的看法：
    我认为有些共产党员的思想作风是有缺点，甚至有错误，开展这次整风运动是必要的。但是我们也应该认识到，做为一个执政党，能这样诚恳、虚心地吸取党外人士的意见，来改进工作，纠正错误，是中国历史上任何一个统治阶级和现在一切非无产阶级领导的国家绝不能做到的，因此我认为，做为一个中国的公民，在这次整风运动中应该站在爱护党的立场，以团结—批评—团结的精神来给党提出意见，帮助党整好风，以便使党能更好地领导我们建成共产主义社会。
    但在葛佩琦的发言中找不到这样一点精神。
    目前物资供应是有些紧张，因为人民的生活提高了，物资供应不上。但这是前进中的困难，大家应该帮助国家多出点办法来逐渐解决这些问题。现在国家出口物资是比以前多了，但这样做是为了换取我国更需要的其他物资，这点是应该理解的。至于现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的人太多，倒是应该提倡节约，但这些人不完全都是党员。
    我觉得“今天老百姓对共产党是敬鬼神而远之”的说法，更不对，老百姓并没有委托他发这样的言，我不知他的发言是根据什么调查资料，代表那一部分人。有些党员在团结非党知识分子的工作中是有缺点，但不等于说人民和共产党疏远了。我是一个资产阶级出身的非党知识分子，曾经在一些政治运动中遭受到过火的斗争，因而在思想感情上一度很不愉快，但是我却没有产生对党疏远的思想。我想，老百姓是有眼睛的，他们看见了过去，也看见了现在，体会是很深的。他们目前虽然暂时吃些苦，有些不满意，但也会懂得将来的生活是会更好的，因而会谅解国家的困难，绝不会像葛佩琦说的那样。
    葛佩琦发言的最后一段里提到“不好，群众可以打倒你们，杀共产党人，推翻你们，这不能说不爱国，因为共产党人不为人民服务，共产党亡了，中国不会亡。因为，不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”。我觉得说些气愤的话是可以的，但他这种话是带有仇意的，这是对党的威胁口吻，不是爱护的态度，不是帮助的精神，我完全不同意这种说法。
