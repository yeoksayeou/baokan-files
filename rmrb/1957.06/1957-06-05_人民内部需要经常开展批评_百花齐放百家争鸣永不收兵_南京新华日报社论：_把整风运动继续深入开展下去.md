Nanjing Xinhua Daily Editorial: "Continue to Deepen the Rectification Movement"
(This Dispatch)
    This dispatch reports that the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial on June 1st entitled "Continue to Deepen the Rectification Movement." The full text is as follows:
    The rectification movement in Jiangsu Province's provincial-level organs and Nanjing and other cities has entered a new stage. Now, we must concentrate our efforts to continue to deepen this great movement, and we must not allow complacency, hesitation, or retreat.
    Since April 12th, provincial and municipal leading organs have convened a series of meetings and forums. The democratic parties, the broad intellectual circles, and people from all walks of life, in order to help our Party with its rectification, have exposed and criticized bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and the work style of overlords at these meetings. The vast majority of these criticisms are well-intentioned and beneficial. Many opinions are positive and pertinent, and many suggestions are constructive. At the beginning of the rectification movement, such exposure and criticism of the shortcomings and errors in our work were indeed good medicine to help us cure our illness and were extremely important conditions for us to improve our thinking and work style. This kind of exposure and criticism should be persistently carried out in the future rectification movement. Party organizations and leading Party cadres at all levels must seriously treat and actively solve the exposed problems with an attitude of responsibility to the Party, the people, friends, and themselves. At the same time, they should gradually and deeply understand the far-reaching significance and purpose of the Party Central Committee's call to launch the rectification movement from the practice of rectification, so as to better transform their own thinking and work style and better train themselves.
    Will criticisms be listened to?
    Will errors be corrected?
    After the start of the rectification movement, some non-Party friends and non-Party cadres had such worries. That is: They don't know whether the Communist Party welcomes criticism or not? If they criticize, they don't know whether the Communist Party is willing to listen or not? If they criticize, they don't know whether the Communist Party will correct it or not? The Communist Party has always believed that in a socialist society, in a revolutionary organization, criticism is a powerful driving force for promoting the progress of the new society and the progress of revolutionary forces. Communists are not only not afraid of criticism, but also welcome criticism. If they are afraid of criticism and become discouraged and weakened after being criticized, then they are not worthy of being vanguards of the working class. Judging from the actual actions of a series of meetings convened by provincial and municipal leading organs, Party committees at all levels welcome criticism, and most leading Party cadres patiently listen to criticism. Will shortcomings and errors be corrected after criticism? They must be corrected, and some have already begun to be corrected. Of course, some units and individuals still have not corrected them enough. Our Party organizations must supervise them to correct them. For some problems, the objective material conditions for solving them are not currently available. We must give play to our subjective initiative and organize social forces to actively create the objective material conditions for solving the problems. Whether to correct or not, whether to correct enough or not, is an important standard for testing whether each of our Party organizations is loyal to the Party and the people, and an important standard for testing the strength of the Party spirit of each leading Party cadre. We firmly believe that the Party organizations and the majority of leading Party cadres who have been tested in the long revolutionary struggle are able to face up to and correct their own shortcomings and errors. The supervision from the bottom up by the broad masses is the basic guarantee for leaders to correct errors. We sincerely hope that this supervision will rapidly and comprehensively develop.

You criticize, you "let go", he criticizes, he "lets go"
    Some people ask: Should criticism of Party organizations and leading Party cadres in provincial and municipal organs, universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions be considered as "letting go" now? Or "tightening up"? We say: The rectification movement is still in its initial stage from the perspective of the entire province. The most urgent and central task of our provincial and municipal Party organizations at present is to continue to deepen the movement. That is to say, we require non-Party personages and the broad masses of cadres to continue to "let go", to "let go" boldly, and to "let go" thoroughly. In view of the uneven development of the movement, continue to criticize and expose where there is insufficient criticism and exposure; this is "letting go." Expressing different opinions is "letting go." You criticize, you "let go", he criticizes, he "lets go". Agreeing with the opinions expressed by others is "letting go." Disagreeing with your opinions but expressing their own opinions is also "letting go." Making specific analyses of the exposed problems is "letting go." Studying and proposing measures and opinions to solve the problems is also "letting go." Feeling that the correction after criticism is insufficient and criticizing again is also "letting go." Immediately criticizing as soon as new shortcomings and errors are discovered in the future is still "letting go." In short, if there is injustice, then speak out; if there is something to "let go", then "let go"; if you want to criticize, then criticize. It is the same today, and it will be the same in the future, because rectification is a long-term matter. "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is an even longer-term matter, and there will never be a day of ceasing. Internal criticism should be conducted regularly among the people, or in other words, "let go" and "speak out" regularly. The in-depth development and regularity of criticism is a manifestation of expanding democratic life. Democracy must be further promoted, democratic life must be continuously expanded, a democratic style must be continuously cultivated, and democratic traditions must be gradually formed. This should be the case within the Party, and it should also be the case outside the Party. The people's servants should do so, and the broad masses of the people should also do so. The promotion of democracy and the unfolding of criticism manifested in the rectification movement is a characteristic of the new socialist society and a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. Only a country led by the Communist Party and based on the worker-peasant alliance dares to mobilize the people to criticize the Party's leadership. This is the greatest democracy in the world, the most extensive democracy, and true democracy, which cannot be compared with bourgeois democracy. In the current rectification movement, we hope that the democratic parties, intellectuals, people from all walks of life, and the broad masses of cadres in provincial and municipal organs, universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions will continue to "speak out" and "let go" freely, and help our Party in its rectification. Facts have proven that in the past fifty days, many comrades and many friends have felt relieved and happy because they have "let out" their pent-up feelings in the "great blooming and contending," their relationship with the Party has begun to improve, their sense of responsibility as masters has been strengthened, and their socialist enthusiasm is growing. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.
Listen patiently, think calmly
Seek truth from facts, be honest
    Some of the shortcomings and errors that have been exposed and will be exposed in the future are defects in certain links of our system, for which our provincial and municipal leaders must be responsible and regulate them. Some are due to problems with the ideological methods and work style of a certain level of Party organization itself, and that level of Party organization must bravely take responsibility and correct them in a timely manner. Some belong to the problems of the leading Party cadres' own ideological style, for which each individual is mainly responsible, consciously raise awareness and correct them, and make a deep and appropriate self-criticism in certain occasions when the movement in their respective units has deepened to a certain extent. However, the most important problem at present is to extensively and deeply solicit criticisms and opinions, mobilize everyone to continue to expose problems, and calmly analyze the movement situation in their own units. Those who have not truly mobilized should mobilize as soon as possible, and those who have not exposed enough should continue to mobilize non-Party personages and cadres to continue to expose. Those who have exposed relatively fully should specifically analyze and study improvement measures, and in the process of analysis and research, they should continue to expose deeply. In short, we must listen patiently and think calmly, and those that can be corrected immediately should be corrected immediately. It is unnecessary to be eager to explain and eager to make self-criticisms, because doing so will objectively affect the continued deepening of the movement. It is also unnecessary and not a realistic and honest attitude to try to take all the exposed shortcomings and errors upon oneself.
    The flowers of the rectification movement in provincial and municipal organs, universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions are in the process of blooming and flourishing. To flourish, we must continue to deepen the movement, and we must direct the spearhead of criticism at the Party organizations and leading Party cadres that are undergoing rectification, because if the leaders are rectified first, everything will be easier to handle. Party organizations and leading Party cadres in units undergoing rectification must stand at the forefront of the movement, boldly lead, strive for initiative, proceed from the actual situation of their own units, and do not simplistically imitate or rigidly apply the practices of other places or other units in a dogmatic way. Look at the trends in other places and other units, and deepen the movement in their own places and units in a led and step-by-step manner according to the instructions of the higher-level Party organizations.
    Grasp the current production work
    At present, gold is everywhere in the rural areas of the whole province, the new wheat has begun to be harvested, and a bumper harvest of summer crops is expected. The tasks of summer pre-distribution and summer planting and summer hoeing are very heavy. June has begun, and the next seven months are the decisive stage for completing the 1957 plan. The problems of the enrollment and employment of hundreds of thousands of graduates and the resettlement of newly demobilized soldiers need to be properly resolved and carried out urgently. Party organizations and relevant departments at all levels must resolutely implement the principle of "no delay in both rectification and work," firmly grasp the above-mentioned tasks in the rectification movement, and must not allow the slightest slackness. Otherwise, it will not only be detrimental to solving internal contradictions among the people, but may instead create and expand contradictions and make major mistakes. Doing the above-mentioned work well in the spirit of rectification is the greatest achievement of rectification, because this work is related to the eating problems of more than 43 million people and related to the economic and cultural construction of this province and the whole country. Units that are not undergoing rectification for the time being must concentrate all their efforts on doing a good job in the current production and work, strengthen ideological education for the broad masses of cadres and people, and solve urgent problems that can be solved. Doing so will create better conditions for the rectification movement in this region and unit on the one hand, and ensure that the units that are undergoing rectification can smoothly continue to deepen the movement on the other hand.

    人民内部需要经常开展批评  百花齐放百家争鸣永不收兵
    南京新华日报社论：“把整风运动继续深入开展下去”
    本报讯　南京新华日报6月1日发表社论，题为“把整风运动继续深入开展下去”，全文如下：
    江苏省省级机关和南京等市整风运动，已经进入新阶段。现在，我们要集中力量把这一伟大运动继续深入开展下去，决不允许满足现状，决不允许迟疑不前，更不允许畏缩后退。
    从4月12日起，省市级领导机关，召开一系列的会议和座谈会，各民主党派、广大知识界和社会人士，为了帮助我党整风，在这些会议上揭发和批评了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义以及老爷作风，其中绝大多数批评是善意的、有益的，有很多意见是积极中肯的，有许多建议是建设性的。在整风运动开始时期，对于我们工作中的缺点和错误的这种揭发和批判，确实是帮助我们治病的良药，是我们改进思想作风极为重要的条件。这种揭发和批判，在今后的整风运动中应当坚持地进行下去。各级党组织和党员领导干部，一定要以对党对人民对朋友对自己负责的态度，严肃地对待和积极地解决揭发出来的问题，同时要从整风的实践中，逐步地深刻领会党中央号召开展整风运动的深远意义和目的，把自己的思想作风改造得更好，把自己锻炼得更好。
    批评了听不听？
    有错误改不改？
    在整风运动开始后，有些党外的朋友和非党干部有这样的忧虑，这就是：不晓得共产党欢迎不欢迎批评？批评吧，不晓得共产党愿听还是不愿听？批评了，不晓得共产党改不改？共产党一向认为在社会主义社会里，在革命组织里，批评是推动新社会前进和推动革命力量前进的强大动力；共产党人不仅不害怕批评，而且欢迎批评，如果害怕批评，被批评后就泄气了，软下来了，就不配是工人阶级的先锋队员了。从省市级领导机关召开一系列的会议的实际行动来看，各级党委是欢迎批评的，大多数党员领导干部是耐心听取批评的。对缺点和错误批评了改不改呢？一定改，而且有些已经开始在改，当然有些单位和个人还是改得不够，我们的党组织一定监督他们改。有些问题目前不具备加以解决的客观物质条件，我们要发挥主观能动性，组织社会力量积极创造解决问题的客观物质条件。改与不改、改得够还是不够，是检验我们每一党组织是否忠于党和人民的重要标准，检验每一党员领导干部党性强弱的重要标准。我们深信久经革命斗争考验的党组织和大多数党员领导干部，是能够正视和改正自己的缺点和错误的。广大群众自下而上的监督，是领导者改正错误的基本保证，我们诚恳地希望这种监督迅速地和多方面地发展起来。你鸣是放，他鸣也是放
    有人问：对省、市机关和高等学校、科学研究机关党组织和党员领导干部开展批评，现在还是“放”呢？还是“收”呢？我们说：现在整风运动从全省范围来说，还是处在它的开始阶段，当前我们省、市机关党组织的最紧迫的中心任务，就是要把运动继续深入下去，也就是要求党外人士、广大干部继续放，大胆放，彻底放。针对着运动发展不平衡的情况，凡是批评、揭发的不够的，继续批评、揭发，这就是放；各抒己见是放，你鸣是放，他鸣也是放；你同意他发表的意见是放，他不同意你的意见，而发表自己的意见也是放；对已揭发的问题加以具体分析是放；研究和提出解决问题的措施和意见也是放；感到批评了改得不够再批评也是放；今后一看到新的缺点和错误产生后，立即进行批评，也还是“放”。总之，不平则鸣，有得放就放，要批评就批评，今天如此，将来也是如此，因为整风是长期的事；百花齐放、百家争鸣是更长期的事，永无收兵之日。人民内部要经常开展批评，或曰经常鸣、经常放。批评的深入开展和经常化，是扩大民主生活的表现。民主一定要进一步发扬，民主生活一定要不断扩大，民主作风一定要不断培养，民主传统一定要逐步形成，党内应该如此，党外也应该如此；人民的勤务员应该如此，广大的人民群众也应该如此。在整风运动中所表现的这种发扬民主，开展批评是社会主义新社会的特点、也是社会主义制度优越性的表现。只有以共产党为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的国家，敢于发动人民对党的领导进行批评，这是世界上最大的民主、最广泛的民主、真正的民主，它决不是资产阶级民主所能比拟的。在当前整风运动中，我们希望民主党派、知识界、社会人士以及省市机关和大专学校、科学研究机关中的广大干部，继续大鸣大放，畅所欲言，帮助我党整风。事实证明，近五十天来，有很多同志、很多朋友在大鸣大放中，由于放出了闷气，自己感到舒畅了，与党的关系开始在改善了，主人翁的责任感加强了，社会主义的积极性正在增长着，这是很可喜的现象。
  耐心倾听，冷静思考
  实事求是，老老实实
    已经揭发和将来要揭发出来的缺点和错误，有些是我们制度的某些环节上的缺陷，我们省、市级领导上要负责，要加以调节的；有些是由于某一级党组织本身的思想方法和工作作风有问题，那一级党组织要勇敢承担起来，及时改正；有些则是属于党员领导干部自己思想作风上的问题，这主要由各人自己负责，自觉起来加以改正，并在所在单位的运动深入到一定程度时，在一定场合中进行深刻的恰如其分的检讨。但目前最主要的问题，是广泛而又深入的征求批评和意见，动员大家继续揭发问题，冷静分析本单位的运动情况，还没有真正发动的要尽速发动，揭发得不够的要继续动员非党人士和干部继续揭发；揭发得比较充分的要具体分析研究改进措施，在分析研究过程中还应继续深入揭发。总之，要自己耐心地倾听，冷静地思考，能立即改的立即改；那种急于解释，急于检讨，是不必要的，因为那样做客观上会影响运动的继续深入开展。还有那种想把所揭发的缺点和错误，一股脑儿都包在自己名下，是不必要的，也不是实事求是、老老实实的态度。
    省市机关、大专学校和科学研究机关的整风运动的鲜花正处在开与盛开之间，要盛开就要继续深入开展运动，就要把批评的矛头，对准正在进行整风的党组织和党员领导干部，因为领导首先整好了，一切事情就好办了。正在进行整风单位的党组织和党员领导干部，一定要站在运动前面，大胆领导，力争主动，从本单位的实际情况出发，不要教条主义地简单化地模仿或硬套别地别单位的做法，看别地别单位的苗头，要根据上级党组织的指示，有领导地有步骤地把本地本单位的运动深入开展下去。
    抓紧当前生产工作
    目前全省农村黄金遍地，新麦开始登场，夏熟丰收有望，夏季预分和夏种夏锄任务十分繁重；6月份开始了，今后七个月是完成1957年计划的决定性阶段；几十万毕业生升学就业问题和新复员军人的安置工作，急待妥善解决和进行，各级党组织和有关部门，必须坚决贯彻执行整风和工作两不误的原则，在整风运动中牢牢抓住上述任务，决不容许丝毫松懈，否则不仅不利于解决人民内部矛盾，相反可能制造和扩大矛盾，犯重大错误。我们以整风精神，做好上述工作，就是整风的最大成绩，因为这些工作是关系到四千三百多万人民的吃饭问题，关系到本省和全国的经济文化建设问题。暂不进行整风的单位一定要集中全力搞好当前生产和工作，加强对广大干部和群众的思想教育，解决迫切需要而又可能解决的问题。这样做，一方面为本地区本单位的整风运动创造更好的条件；另一方面也保证了正在进行整风的单位，能够顺利地把运动继续深入下去。
