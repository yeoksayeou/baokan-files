(Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) Thai political figures and members of the press have issued statements and commentaries supporting the just actions of the Taiwanese people in their anti-American demonstrations, and demanding that Thai authorities learn a lesson from this and consider changing relations with the United States.

Nai Thep Chotinuchit, chairman of the Socialist United Front and leader of the Economist Party, said at a press conference on May 29 that the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan were a manifestation of the long-standing resentment of the Taiwanese people against the American military’s occupation of Taiwan. This incident will awaken the Taiwanese people on a large scale, ultimately promoting the peaceful reunification of China. Nai Thep demanded that Thai authorities learn a lesson from the anti-American incident in Taiwan and reconsider Thai-American relations. This is because there are also American military personnel stationed in Thailand, who also enjoy diplomatic privileges. Therefore, they may also stage a killing tragedy in Thailand like the one in Taiwan.

Nai Klaeo Norapati, Secretary-General of the Socialist United Front, pointed out that the anti-American demonstrations by the Taiwanese people are a sign that imperialism is facing a complete collapse in Asia and even the world, and it tolls the death knell for imperialism.

Nai Anphon Suwannabun, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and member of Parliament, expressed his opposition to foreign countries enjoying extraterritorial rights in other countries when talking about the causes of the anti-American incident in Taiwan on May 28. He also opposed any economic and military agreements that are binding on Thailand.

Newspaper reports said that a senior figure from the coup group who did not want to be named said on the 28th that the anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people was a reasonable thing. He also believes that the United States should not interfere with the cooperation between the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He said that the Chinese people in Taiwan and mainland China are originally one family. If they can cooperate, it would be a great thing.

The Bangkok "Picture News" published an editorial on May 28, saying that people all over the world believe that this incident is a manifestation of the true heroic behavior of the Taiwanese people. It clearly shows that the Taiwanese people can no longer tolerate being slaves of the United States, and they have long deeply hated the oppressive policies imposed by American imperialism on Taiwan.

The editorial of "New Thai News" accused the extravagant behavior of American soldiers in foreign countries, saying that those American soldiers neither have cars nor servants in their own country, but when they arrive in Thailand, they have everything. Isn't this squeezed from the taxes of the Thai people?

The editorial of "Eternal News" pointed out that old-style imperialism has begun to be active again in the Asian and African regions. They exercise extraterritorial rights in Asian and African countries with powers that transcend the sovereignty of other countries, and Thailand is also a country in this situation.

    泰国舆论支持台湾人民反美斗争
    要求泰国当局吸取教训改变对美关系
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯泰国政界人士和舆论界纷纷发表谈话和评论，支持台湾人民反美示威的正义行动，并要求泰国当局从中吸取教训，考虑改变对美国关系。
    社会主义联合阵线主席、经济人党领袖乃贴·触的努七在5月29日的记者招待会上说，台湾的反美示威事件是台湾人民不满美军侵占台湾的郁积已久的情绪的表现。这次事件将使台湾人民普遍地觉悟起来，从而最终促成中国的和平统一。乃贴要求泰国当局从台湾反美事件中吸取教训，重新考虑泰美关系。因为在泰国也驻有美国军事人员，他们同样享有外交特权。因此他们也可能在泰国演出像在台湾演出的那样的杀人悲剧。
    社会主义联合阵线秘书长乃克莱·纳拉帕蒂指出，台湾人民的反美示威事件，是帝国主义将在亚洲以至全世界面临全面崩溃的征兆，它为帝国主义敲响了丧钟。
    自由民主党副领袖、议员乃安蓬·素旺那汶5月28日在谈到引起台湾反美事件的原因时，表示反对外国在别国享有治外法权，他同时反对任何对泰国有约束性的经济和军事协定。
    报纸消息说，一位不愿透露姓名的变政团高级人物28日说，台湾人民的反美示威是一件合理的事。他还认为，美国不应干预中国国民党同共产党的合作。他说，台湾和中国大陆的中国人本来就是一家人，如果能够合作，是一件再好不过的事。
    曼谷“图画新闻”5月28日发表社论说，全世界人民都认为这次事件是台湾人民真正的英雄行为的表现。它清楚表明，台湾人民已经不能继续忍受做美国的奴隶，他们老早就深切憎恨美帝国主义对台湾所施行的压制政策。
    “新泰报”的社论指责美国军人在外国的骄奢行为说，那些美国兵在自己国家里既没有汽车又没有佣人，但一到泰国他们就甚么都齐备，这难道不是从泰国人民的赋税中榨取来的吗？
    “永恒报”的社论指出，旧式帝国主义又开始在亚非地区活跃，他们以超越别国主权的权力在亚非国家中运用治外法权，泰国也是一个处在这种境况下的国家。
