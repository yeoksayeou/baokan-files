　　State-owned Coal Mines Can Overproduce More Than One Million Tons
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) As of June 26th, the coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry had completed 100.05% of the semi-annual raw coal production plan, overproducing more than 20,000 tons. It is estimated that by the end of June, more than 1.4 million tons can be overproduced (including the increase in production during the Spring Festival), an increase of 13.36% compared with the same period last year.
    However, the safety production situation in some units was not good in the first half of the year. According to national statistics from January to May, major accidents increased compared with the same period last year. All localities should quickly take effective measures to ensure safe production. (Communications Group of the Production Technology Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry)
