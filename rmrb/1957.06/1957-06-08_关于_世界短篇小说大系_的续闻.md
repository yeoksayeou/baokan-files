    Further News About "World Short Story Collection"
    Comrade ××:
    The day after the second part of "Editing Memoirs" was published, I received a telegram from China Youth Publishing House, expressing their willingness to publish the "World Short Story Collection" and saying that they would send someone to Shanghai to discuss the matter with me in person. We are now in contact through correspondence and have initially decided that I will still be the chief editor of this collection, which will be published by China Youth Publishing House, taking one or two years. If a dream from twenty years ago can be realized because of this, I must first thank the People's Daily for playing such a significant role.
    According to reader feedback, there is also an urgent demand for a reprint of the "Chinese New Literature Collection." I may go to Beijing in June, and I will also seek the opinion of China Youth Publishing House. If they are willing, after slight revisions, it can also be published by China Youth Publishing House.

### 关于“世界短篇小说大系”的续闻

    关于“世界短篇小说大系”的续闻××同志：
    “编辑忆旧”第二篇刊出后的第二天，我就收到中国青年出版社的电报，愿意出版“世界短篇小说大系”，并说将派人到上海来和我面洽。我们现在已通信联系，初步决定仍由我主编这套大系，由中国青年出版社出版，需时一、二年。假如二十年前的一个梦想因此而得以实现，首先要感谢人民日报在这里起了重大的作用。
    根据读者反映，对“中国新文学大系”也有迫切的再版要求，我可能在6月中到北京，我也将征求中国青年出版社的意见，他们愿意的话，略加修订，也可由中国青年出版社出版。
