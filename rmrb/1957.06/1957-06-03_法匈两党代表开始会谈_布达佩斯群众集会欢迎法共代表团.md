Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 2nd: The delegation of the French Communist Party, headed by Guyot, and the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, headed by Marosán, have begun talks in Budapest.

On the afternoon of May 31st, thousands of working people in Budapest gathered at the gymnasium to welcome the French Communist Party delegation. Guyot and Marosán spoke at the meeting.

Guyot said that last autumn, when the Hungarian people, with the help of the Soviet Union, were fighting to crush the counter-revolutionary offensive, we stood by your side. From the Hungarian incident and the Paris incident (the attack on the headquarters of the French Communist Party) launched by the French reactionary forces after the incident, and the French aggression against Egypt, we should draw the following lessons from the facts: First, the imperialist forces have weakened on a global scale since the Second World War, but they are still quite strong and cunning, which we must not forget; second, the class struggle exists not only in capitalist countries, but also in countries where socialism has already triumphed; third, we must defend the unity of the international workers' movement and unite around the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; fourth, in the struggle against dogmatism and revisionism, we must maintain the unity of the Party and our loyalty to Marxism-Leninism.

Marosán said in his speech that we should work hard, not only because we want to make up for the losses caused by the October incident last year, but also to put the communists who are fighting in capitalist countries in a favorable situation. During the October incident last year, the Soviet Union's armed assistance to us and the struggle of the French communists fully embodied the spirit of proletarian internationalism. This is what we should be grateful for.

A workers' meeting was also held at a shipyard in the tenth district of Budapest to welcome the French Communist Party delegation. Other members of the delegation attended the meeting.

    法匈两党代表开始会谈
    布达佩斯群众集会欢迎法共代表团
    据新华社布达佩斯2日电　以居约为首的法国共产党代表团和以马罗山为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团已经在布达佩斯开始举行会谈。
    5月31日下午，布达佩斯市数千劳动群众在体育馆集会，欢迎法共代表团。居约和马罗山在会上讲了话。
    居约说，去年秋天，当匈牙利人民在苏联帮助下进行粉碎反革命进攻的斗争时，我们就站到你们一边了。从匈牙利事件和事件以后法国反动势力搞起的巴黎事件（对法共中央大厦的进攻）和法国侵埃战争等事实来看，帝国主义虽然失败了，但是应当得出这样的一些教训：一、帝国主义势力在第二次世界大战后在世界规模上削弱了，但是现在仍然相当强大和狡猾，这点我们不能忘掉；二、阶级斗争不仅在资本主义国家里存在，而且在社会主义已经取得胜利的国家中也还存在着；三、应当保卫国际工人运动的团结，应当团结在苏联和苏联共产党的周围；四、在进行反对教条主义和修正主义的斗争中，应当保持党的团结和对马克思列宁主义的忠诚。
    马罗山在讲话中说，我们应当努力工作，这不仅是因为我们要弥补去年十月事件所造成的损失，而且要使在资本主义国家进行着斗争的共产党员们处于有利的情况。在去年十月事件期间，苏联对我们的武装援助和法国共产党员们的斗争，都充分体现了无产阶级国际主义的精神。这是我们应当感谢的。
    布达佩斯第十区的一个造船厂也举行了工人大会，欢迎法共代表团。代表团的其他几个团员参加了大会。
