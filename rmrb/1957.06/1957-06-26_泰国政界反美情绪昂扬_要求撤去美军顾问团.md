Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: Thai parliamentarian and executive committee member of the Socialist United Front, Nai Thawi Sethi, submitted an emergency interpellation to the parliament on the 19th, questioning: Has the Thai government considered the issue of the U.S. Military Advisory Group withdrawing from Thailand? When will this advisory group withdraw? If it does not withdraw, what are the reasons? Can the Thai government stop accepting U.S. military aid?

Nai Thawi Sethi pointed out when raising the question that the U.S. Military Advisory Group gives a bad impression to the Thai people. He believes that the presence of this advisory group in Thailand and the Thai government's policy of expanding its military and preparing for war have hindered Thailand's economic development and caused its economic decline.

Nai Khlai Narapati, secretary of the Economist Party and member of parliament, told reporters on the 20th, criticizing the U.S. military for shooting Japanese women and the U.S. authorities' refusal to hand over the perpetrators to Japanese courts for trial, which demonstrated U.S. discrimination against people of color. He said that because the United States is deluded by power, it has caused the hatred of Asians towards the United States to become increasingly widespread and deepened.

Nai Khlai pointed out that the United States is also interfering in Thailand's internal affairs. As long as the Thai government does not get rid of the shackles of the United States, Thailand cannot talk about independence and freedom at all. He stated that the Economist Party has always insisted on opposing U.S. interference in Thailand's internal affairs and strongly opposes the U.S. Military Advisory Group remaining in Thailand.

　　泰国政界反美情绪昂扬
    要求撤去美军顾问团
    据新华社25日讯  泰国议员、社会主义联合阵线执行委员乃他威塞19日向议会提出一项紧急质问案，质问：泰国政府是否考虑到美国军事顾问团撤离泰国的问题？这个顾问团什么时候才撤走？如果不撤走，原因是什么？泰国政府是否可以停止接受美国的军事援助？
    乃他威塞在提出质问的时候指出，美国军事顾问团给予泰国人民不好的印象。他认为，这个顾问团驻在泰国，以及泰国政府采取扩军备战政策，已经妨碍了泰国经济的发展，使泰国经济衰落。
    经济人党书记、议员乃克莱·纳拉帕蒂20日向报界发表谈话，指责美军枪杀日本妇女和美国当局不肯把凶犯交给日本法庭审判的做法，表现了美国对有色人种的歧视。他说，由于美国迷惑于强权，已经使亚洲人对美国的憎恨日益广泛和加深。
    乃克莱指出，美国同样在干涉泰国的内政。只要泰国政府一天不摆脱美国束缚，泰国就根本谈不上独立和自由。他表示，经济人党始终坚持反对美国对泰国内政的干涉，同时也强烈反对美国军事顾问团留在泰国。
