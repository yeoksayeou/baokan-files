　　Leadership and Supervision
　　Ding San
　　Judging from the materials successively published in various newspapers, some people who call themselves "big intellectuals" are least interested in the leadership of the Communist Party, and most interested in "mutual supervision" among the various parties. For example, Luo Longji believed that the local organizations of the "China Democratic League" were under the leadership of the Communist Party, which was "severing the China Democratic League at the waist," saying that the democratic parties had nothing to do. But as soon as he heard "mutual supervision," he "immediately became active," saying that the democratic parties had something to do again and should develop greatly. In terms of the role of the two words "leadership" and "supervision" in the thoughts and feelings of these people, the former is ice and the latter is fire.
　　The reason is very simple. With the leadership of the Communist Party, they have to follow the path of socialism in a proper manner, which is not convenient for engaging in "invisible organizations" and it is difficult to "show their special abilities." What's the point then? As for "mutual supervision," that is desirable. You supervise me, and I supervise you, without anyone needing to lead anyone. In this way, no one can control invisible or tangible organizations, and they can "rely on their abilities and show their special abilities." Even Zhang Bojun's pursuit of ideals can be realized: if you can't do it, I'll do it; if I can't do it, you'll do it. How democratic, how free!
　　But unfortunately: this kind of democracy and freedom without "leadership" does not even exist in the United States, where people "If you can't do it, I'll do it; if I can't do it, you'll do it." Are the roles that come and go on the American political stage really so "free"? I don't think so. First, there are standards for "doing" or "not doing," and that is to see if you serve the exploitation cause of the monopoly capitalists well; therefore, second, the final decision on whether "you come" or "I come" lies with Wall Street. This is American-style "leadership"! Only within the scope allowed by "leadership," that is, within the scope of strengthening the rule of big capitalists, can one "rely on one's ability and show one's special abilities"!
　　So, who should lead our country, which is carrying out socialist construction, and how should it be led?
　　In fact, history has already answered this question. I remember eleven years ago, during the period when "Five-Star Marshal" Marshall's special envoy "ascended Mount Lu eight times," some "big intellectuals" once "relied on their abilities and showed their special abilities" and played a farce of the so-called "third road," thinking that they could win Marshall's favor. But for some reason, this foreign master was blind and "underestimated" the actions of these "big intellectuals," and did not give them a small part of the aid that the United States gave to the Kuomintang reactionaries, watching the Kuomintang collapse and the Communist Party win. It is said that this was Marshall's big mistake, and they still have resentment to this day. Knowing that the Kuomintang "can't do it," why not let "me come"? Serves them right! However, this is, after all, a precious historical mirror, which clearly shows the internal organs of these "big intellectuals" and shows which class and which party should hold the leadership of China's revolution and construction!
　　More than ten years have passed, and earth-shaking changes have taken place in China, but a small handful of "big intellectuals" are still so lacking in knowledge and still unwilling to give up their shattered illusions: if you can't do it, I'll do it!
　　Leading 600 million people to build a new socialist mansion on the ruins of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society is not a child's play. What "abilities" and "special powers" do you rely on to "come"? Read carefully Premier Zhou's report at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress: In the past eight years, how many difficulties have been overcome and how many achievements have been made? What are the shortcomings and mistakes? What kind of shortcomings and mistakes? Which aspect is the main and basic one? If we only look at the shortcomings and mistakes and not the achievements, then not only will "democratic parties have nothing to do," but what's the point of the entire socialist transformation and construction cause? If we don't engage in socialism, what should we engage in? Engage in "if you can't do it, I'll do it" ism? That can only allow Marshalls to come to China again to make "big mistakes"! Even if some "big intellectuals" can "show their special abilities," what about the people of the whole country? There are landlords in the countryside, bosses in the factories, and above the landlords, bosses, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, there is the American Emperor, as well as the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" that trains spies and supplies silent pistols! Whether "you come" or "I come," it is not necessarily so "free," and people should have memories.
　　So, after saying all this, it is better to honestly follow the path of socialism. There is both the leadership of the Communist Party and the "mutual supervision" of the various parties. Leadership is based on socialist principles, and supervision is also based on socialist principles. The idea and practice of not wanting "leadership" but only wanting "supervision" will only lead you to a dead end, no matter how great your "abilities" are or how you show your "special powers"!

　　领导和监督
　　丁三
    从各报陆续发表的材料看来，有些自称“大知识分子”的人最不感兴趣的是共产党的领导，而最感兴趣的是各党派“互相监督”。例如罗隆基认为“民盟”地方组织受共产党领导，就是“腰斩民盟”，说民主党派没有什么搞头了。可是一听到“互相监督”，他“马上积极起来”，说民主党派又有搞头了，要大发展。就“领导”和“监督”这两个词儿在这类人的思想感情中的作用来说，前者是冰，后者是火。
    论原因，倒也简单得很。有了共产党的领导，他们就得规规矩矩地走社会主义的路，不便搞“无形的组织”，很难“各显神通”。那还有什么搞头呢？至于“互相监督”，那是要得的。你监督我，我监督你，用不着谁领导谁。这样一来，谁也管不着无形的组织或有形的组织，可以“各凭本事，各显神通”，连章伯钧所追求的理想，也可以实现了：你不行，我来；我不行，你来。何等民主，何等自由！
    但可惜的是：这样没有“领导”的民主和自由，连在“你不行，我来；我不行，你来”的美国，也不存在。在美国政治舞台上来来去去的角色真是那么“自由”吗？我看不见得。第一，“行”与不“行”，是有标准的，那就是看你为垄断资本家的剥削事业服务得好不好；因此第二，到底“你来”还是“我来”的最后决定权在华尔街。这就是美国式的“领导”！只有在“领导”所允许的范围内，就是说，在加强大资本家统治的范围内，才能“各凭本事，各显神通”！
    那么正在进行社会主义建设的我国，应该由谁来领导，怎样领导呢？
    其实，历史早已回答了这个问题。记得十一年前，在“五星元帅”马歇尔特使“八上庐山”的期间，有些“大知识分子”曾经“各凭本事，各显神通”，扮演其所谓“第三条路线”的滑稽剧，满以为能够博得马歇尔的青睐。可是不知怎的，这位洋大人有眼无珠，“低估”了这些“大知识分子”的作为，竟没有把美国给予国民党反动派的援助的一小部分给予他们，眼巴巴地看着国民党垮台，共产党胜利。据说这是马歇尔的大错误，他们直到今天尚有余恨。明知国民党“不行”，为什么不叫“我来”？活该！然而这毕竟是一面宝贵的历史镜子，它清楚地照出了这些“大知识分子”的五脏六腑，照出了中国的革命和建设的领导权应该由哪个阶级、哪个政党掌握！
    时间过去了十多年，中国发生了翻天覆地的变革，可是一小撮“大知识分子”依然那样缺乏知识，依然不愿丢掉早已粉碎的妄想：你不行，我来！
    领导六亿人民在半封建、半殖民地的社会废墟上建设社会主义新大厦，那不是儿戏。你凭什么“本事”和“神通”“来”呢？仔细读读周总理在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上的报告吧：八年以来，到底克服了多少困难，得到多少成绩？到底有多少缺点和错误？怎样的缺点和错误？到底哪一方面是主要的、基本的？如果不看成绩，只看缺点和错误，那么非但“民主党派没有什么搞头”，整个社会主义的改造和建设事业又有什么搞头？不搞社会主义又搞什么呢？搞“你不行，我来”主义吗？那只能让马歇尔们再到中国来犯“大错误”！即使某些“大知识分子”可以“各显神通”，全国人民怎么办？农村有地主，工厂有老板，而地主、老板、官僚资产阶级上头又有美国太上皇，还有训练特务和供给无声手枪的“中美合作所”！“你来”也好，“我来”也好，都不见得怎样“自由”，人应该有记性。
    所以说来说去，还是老老实实地走社会主义的路好。既有共产党的领导，又有各党派的“互相监督”。领导是根据社会主义原则，监督也是根据社会主义原则。不要“领导”，只要“监督”的想法和作法，只会把你引到绝路上去，不管你有多大“本事”，显出怎样的“神通”！
