    Uphold the Leadership of the Communist Party, Resolutely Follow the Socialist Road
    Da Pusheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association
    Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has recently been officially published. In this speech, Chairman Mao pointed out that we must distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people, during the period of socialist construction. He systematically pointed out the correct policy for handling contradictions among the people, and thoroughly explained the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom. He put forward six political criteria so that we can correctly distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. Chairman Mao's speech will surely greatly enhance the awareness of the people throughout the country, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, and make our cause of building socialism develop more rapidly and healthily. After reading Chairman Mao's speech, I was very moved and fully support it. I will also read it carefully.
    Recently, a group of right-wingers, including Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Chu Anping, took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to publish fallacies against the people, against socialism, and against the leadership of the Communist Party, and conspired to drag China towards capitalism. I strongly disagree with this when I heard it. I am very indignant at their conspiracy. I am a Hui Muslim, an Ahong of Islam. I support the Communist Party and resolutely follow the socialist road.
    I was born in the first year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Of my eighty-three years, I lived seventy-five years in the old society. The young people of the new China probably do not know how hard life was in the old society. At that time, the people of the whole country were oppressed by landlords, the bourgeoisie, and imperialism, and life was very hard. But the Muslims of the ten ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam suffered even more oppression and pain that cannot be described.
    Take our Hui people as an example. In old China, we Hui people were not recognized as a nation at all. They called us "thieving Huis." They called our religion "small religion." Chiang Kai-shek said that we were "minor branches" of the Han people with "special living habits." Please think about it, if our nation is denied, how can we have an equal status? How can we have a happy life?
    At that time, the exploitation and oppression, discrimination and insults we suffered were truly unbearable to recall. The economy of the Hui people was squeezed out. In rural areas, most of them had no land, and in cities, they could only work as small vendors. Even small vendors were squeezed out. Culture was very backward. How many Hui children could enter school and learn culture? Even if the family had the conditions to enter school, wouldn't many people have to drop out because our customs were not respected? Our religious beliefs were insulted and discriminated against. Barracks were stationed in mosques, and horses were fed there. Some mosques were even demolished and burned. When the Kuomintang ruled, they even published books and newspapers that insulted our Islamic religion and cursed our Hui people. What is particularly heartbreaking is that these reactionary ruling classes provoked ethnic relations and carried out massacres against us, trying to eliminate our Hui people. Not to mention the distant past, just take the incidents in 1928, 1939, and 1942. Which time weren't thousands of people killed by the ruling class? Can we forget the suffering we endured in old China?
    In 1949, the people of all ethnic groups across the country were liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. Our Hui people also saw the light of day again. The Communist Party not only recognized us as a nation, but also consistently insisted on abolishing national oppression, advocated equality among all ethnic groups, advocated freedom of religious belief, and actively helped the Hui people develop. In the areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, four Hui autonomous prefectures, nine Hui autonomous counties, and more than one hundred Hui ethnic townships have been established in the past eight years. Autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, autonomous counties, and ethnic townships have also been established in areas where other minority ethnic groups live. In places where Muslims live, our Ahongs, maulas, or village elders participate in people's congresses or CPPCC meetings. Religious beliefs and customs are fully protected by the state constitution and laws. Many mosques have been renovated with the help of the government. The economies of the ten ethnic groups who believe in Islam have undergone tremendous development, and culture has also been generally improved. Compared with the old China, wasn't the old society a prison for all ethnic groups in China? Isn't the Communist Party the savior of all ethnic groups in China? Without the leadership of the Communist Party and without taking the socialist road, wouldn't our ten ethnic groups who believe in Islam still be "minor branches" of the Han people and gradually be eliminated?
    Recently, the CPC Central Committee once again proposed the establishment of a Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region at the provincial level, which is another great joy for the Hui people. There are more than 3.5 million Hui people across the country, but due to historical reasons, most of them are scattered throughout the country. After liberation, we are very happy and happy to live in the big family of all ethnic groups in the new China. But we always hope that in the big family of the motherland, there can also be a small family of our Hui autonomous region. This is the ideal of our Hui people for generations. This ideal has finally been realized during the period of socialist construction in the motherland. How can we Hui people not be excited and surprised! How can we not thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! How can we not resolutely follow the socialist road!
    However, right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi told us: the Communist Party oppresses the people, the Communist Party is not democratic, and the lives of the people are even harder after liberation... This is truly speaking lies in broad daylight. I lived in the old society for seventy-five years. Haven't we Muslims suffered enough discrimination and oppression? Don't we understand that without the Communist Party, could we have today? Can we allow right-wingers to drag us back into the disaster of old China? I firmly support the Communist Party and resolutely follow the socialist road. I believe that the ten million Muslims of the ten ethnic groups across the country, like me, firmly support the Communist Party and resolutely follow the socialist road.
    These right-wingers have verbally supported the Communist Party and socialism, but in reality, they oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and want to take the capitalist road. Now they believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch vicious attacks on the Communist Party and oppose socialism. This kind of double-dealing is completely the behavior of "Iblis" (the devil) and is truly hateful.
    I hope that Muslims across the country, especially the Ahongs who lead religious affairs, will draw a clear line between themselves and the right-wingers. If anyone has been blinded by the fallacies of the right-wing reactionaries, they should think about the lives of us Muslims in two different worlds before and after liberation. We should wake up quickly and, in this major political struggle that concerns the fate of the country, stand on the side of the people, firmly support the Communist Party, and resolutely follow the socialist road.

    拥护共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任　达浦生
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，最近正式发表了。主席这篇讲话里，指出了我们要区别在建设社会主义时期的敌我之间与人民内部的两类性质不同的矛盾，系统地指出了正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，透彻地说明了百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针。提出六条政治标准，使我们能正确的鉴别香花和毒草。主席的讲话，一定能大大的提高全国人民的觉悟，加强全国各族人民的团结，使我国建设社会主义的事业更加迅速、更加健康的向前发展。我读了主席这篇讲话以后，十分感动，完全拥护。我还要仔细的阅读。
    最近以来，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平等一批右派分子，利用共产党整风的机会，发表反对人民、反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的谬论，阴谋把中国拉向资本主义。我听到以后，十分不赞成。对他们的阴谋，十分愤慨。我是回民，是伊斯兰教的一位阿訇。我是拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义道路的。
    我生在清朝光绪元年。在八十三年中，有七十五年生活在旧社会。现在新中国的青年，恐怕不大知道旧社会的日子有多苦。那个时候，全国人民都受着大地主、大资产阶级和帝国主义的压迫，生活都很苦。可是我国信仰伊斯兰教的十个民族的穆斯林，受到的压迫和痛苦，更是说不完。
    就拿我们回族来说吧，在旧中国，我们回族根本不被人承认是一个民族。骂我们是“贼回子”。称我们是“小教”。蒋介石说我们是汉族的“大小宗支”，“特殊生活习惯”的人。请想一想，我们的民族都被否定了，我们还能有什么平等的地位呢？还能有顺心的好日子吗？
    那个时候，我们受到的剥削和压迫，歧视和侮辱，真是不能回想。回族人民的经济受到排挤，在农村里大部分没有土地，城市里也只能作些小商小贩。就是小商小贩也受到排挤。文化十分落后，有多少回族子女能进学校，学文化？就是家庭有条件能进学校，不是也因为不尊重我们的风俗习惯，许多人不得不退学了吗？我们的宗教信仰受到侮辱歧视，清真寺被驻过兵，喂过马。有的清真寺还被拆过，烧过。国民党统治的时候，还出过书报侮辱我们伊斯兰教，谩骂我们回民。特别痛心的是，这些反动统治阶级挑拨民族关系，对我们进行大屠杀，想消灭我们回族。远的不说，就以民国十七年，二十八年，三十一年的事件来说，哪一次不是有成千上万的人被统治阶级杀死了？我们在旧中国受的苦，能忘记得了吗？
    1949年，全国各族人民在共产党领导下得到解放。我们回族人民也重见天日了。共产党不仅承认我们是个民族，并且一贯地坚持废除民族压迫，主张各民族一律平等，主张宗教信仰自由，积极地帮助回族发展。在回族聚居的地方，八年来成立了四个回族自治州，九个回族自治县，还有一百多个回族民族乡。其他各个少数民族聚住的地方也都分别成立了自治区、自治州、自治县、民族乡。在有穆斯林居住的地方，都有我们的阿訇、毛拉或乡老参加人民代表会或政协会议。宗教信仰和风俗习惯受到国家宪法和法律的充分保护。不少清真寺在政府帮助下修葺的焕然一新。我们信仰伊斯兰教的十个民族的经济都有巨大的发展，文化也有普遍的提高。同旧中国比一比，旧社会难道不是中国各民族的牢狱？共产党不是中国各民族的救星吗？如果没有共产党的领导，不走社会主义道路，我们信仰伊斯兰教的十个民族，不仍旧是汉族的“大小宗支”，渐渐的被消灭了吗？
    最近中共中央又倡议成立省一级的宁夏回族自治区，更是回族人民的又一件大喜事。全国回族人民共三百五十多万，可是由于历史的原因，大多分散在全国各地。解放以后，我们生活在新中国各民族的大家庭里是十分高兴，十分幸福的。但我们始终希望在祖国大家庭里，还能有一个我们回族自治的小家庭。这是我们回族人民千百年来世世代代的理想。这理想终于在祖国建设社会主义的时期实现了。我们回族人民怎能不兴奋惊喜！怎能不感谢共产党和毛主席！怎能不坚决走社会主义道路！
    可是章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等右派分子却对我们说：共产党压迫人民，共产党不民主，解放以后人民的生活更苦了……。这真是大白天说黑话。我在旧社会生活了七十五年，我们穆斯林受的歧视、压迫受的还不够吗？难道我们不明白，如果没有共产党我们能有今天吗？难道我们能允许右派分子将我们拉回旧中国的灾难里去吗？我是坚决拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义道路的。我相信全国十个民族的一千万穆斯林也同我一样，是坚决拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义道路的。
    这些右派分子口头上曾经拥护共产党，拥护社会主义，实际上是反对共产党的领导，要走资本主义。现在认为有机可乘，利用共产党整风的机会，就对共产党进行恶毒的进攻，反对社会主义。这种两面派手段，完全是“易卜利斯”（魔鬼）的行为，实在可恶。
    我希望全国穆斯林，特别是领导教务的阿訇，与右派分子划清界限。如果有人曾经受过右派反动谬论的蒙昧，就应该想想我们穆斯林在解放前后两个不同世界的生活。应该赶快清醒过来，在这场关系国家命运的重大政治斗争中，站在人民的一边，坚决拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义道路。
