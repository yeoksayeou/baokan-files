　　School Buildings That Can Be Large or Small as Needed
    A steel products company in the United States recently designed a new type of school building, the walls of which can be expanded as needed.
    The walls of this building are made of steel and glass and are screwed onto the building. When the school's population increases and the school building needs to be expanded, these walls can be disassembled and moved outward to accommodate more classrooms; when they are not needed, they can be restored to their original state.
    The cost of this building is very low, only two-thirds of the cost of ordinary school buildings; and the time required for construction is only one-quarter of that of general construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　小大由之的校舍
    美国一个钢铁制品公司最近设计了一种新式的学校建筑，它的墙壁可以随着需要而扩大。
    这种建筑的墙壁用钢和玻璃制造，它是用螺丝钉钉在建筑物上的。当学校的人数增加，校舍需要扩大的时候，这种墙壁就可以拆开向外移，以便容纳更多的教室；当不需要的时候，又可以还原。
    这种建筑的费用很便宜，只有普通学校建筑费用的三分之二；而建筑所需的时间却只要一般建筑的四分之一。（新华社）
