Kishi Nobusuke Played a Round of Golf for Nothing
    After Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi arrived in Washington, he indeed played three and a half hours of golf with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the first day. Kyodo News made a special note of this in a report, considering it an "exceptional kindness" on the part of President Eisenhower, and said that this kind of "kindness and welcome" greatly "moved" and "seemed to relieve" Japanese government officials who were deeply concerned about American public opinion before and after Kishi's departure.
    However, playing golf is playing golf, and negotiations are negotiations. President Eisenhower's "kindness" at the negotiating table did not seem as "exceptional" as it was on the golf course. Although Kishi Nobusuke stated upon arriving in Washington that he "confidently hoped" that this visit to the United States would help "open a new era for Japan-U.S. relations," judging from the information revealed in the three days of talks and the content of the joint communique, saying that Japan-U.S. relations are "entering a new era based on solid foundations of common interests and trust" is nothing more than boilerplate language.
    The Japanese people's strong desire and greatest interest are independence and autonomy, abolishing the unequal Japan-U.S. treaties, canceling military bases, withdrawing U.S. troops, and recovering Okinawa, etc. However, on these issues, the Japan-U.S. joint communique either equivocated and procrastinated, or the United States made a few promises that hardly counted as "concessions," but in exchange, it obtained tighter urging and pressure on Japan to rearm. For example, regarding the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the communique only stated that the U.S. and Japan had reached an agreement to establish an intergovernmental committee to study issues arising in connection with the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Not only was the Japanese people's desire to abolish this unequal treaty not considered at all, but Kishi Nobusuke's revealed hope that the United States would allow a "major revision" of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty did not seem to receive much serious consideration.
    On the issue of troop deployments, the United States promised to "significantly reduce the number of American troops stationed in Japan, including the rapid withdrawal of all American ground combat troops within the next year." This can be regarded as a unique clause with specific content in the joint communique. However, considering the recent anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taipei, the surge of anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people due to the Girard incident, the United States' original plan to withdraw the Far East Command and the so-called Allied Command from Japan on July 1 this year, and the reduction of U.S. overseas troop deployments, etc., this promise made by the United States to Japan is actually not much of a "concession," but merely a favor done in passing. However, the joint communique made no mention of the withdrawal of U.S. naval and air forces. According to news reports: "U.S. officials stated that U.S. naval and air force bases in Japan will remain for a long time, and even after Japan completes its rearmament plan, it "does not mean" that "U.S. bases will be unnecessary." What does this mean after all? This means that the day when Japan can remove foreign military bases from its territory and erase this mark of shame of being half-occupied is pushed into the indefinite future.
    Similarly, the issue of returning the Ryukyu Islands to Japan is also pushed into the indefinite future. Eisenhower believes that as long as the "tense situation" in the Far East exists, the United States "needs to maintain the status quo" in the Ryukyu Islands. The United States' post-war world policy has always used anti-communism as a pretext and creating tense situations as a means to achieve its goal of suppressing national independence and promoting neo-colonialism. Therefore, in Eisenhower's view, the "tense situation" in the Far East will always exist; and the issue of returning the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, is undoubtedly equivalent to being sentenced to life imprisonment.
    Kishi Nobusuke's plan to strengthen Japan's military buildup was welcomed by the United States. At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke repeatedly expressed his anti-communist stance in the United States, posing as if he was willing to serve as a vanguard in the U.S. anti-communist crusade. People will see that Kishi Nobusuke's tighter tethering of Japan to the U.S. war machine will lead the Japanese people down a dangerous road full of disasters!
    Kishi Nobusuke expressed his anti-communist stance and indicated his willingness to act as the United States' proxy in the Asian anti-communist system, originally wanting to use this to gain the United States' appreciation, so as to reach out to the United States for money and realize his "Asian Development Fund Plan" to satisfy the long-cherished wish of Japanese monopoly capital to enter Southeast Asia with the help of U.S. capital. Although Kishi Nobusuke had high hopes for this and made full preparations in advance, the United States had its own calculations and only expressed its intention to "study" Kishi Nobusuke's plan. As for Japan's request that the United States open its domestic market to it, Eisenhower stated that he would "not impose unnecessary and arbitrary restrictions." In fact, this is nothing more than empty talk, because any restriction can be considered "necessary."
    Kishi Nobusuke went to the United States under the guise of adjusting Japan-U.S. relations, wanting to exchange Japan's plan to strengthen its military buildup and its expression of "loyalty" and "cooperation" with the United States for certain concessions from the United States, so as to ease the growing anti-American sentiment among the domestic people and stabilize the Liberal Democratic Party's regime. Judging from the fact that Kishi Nobusuke placed the reorganization of his cabinet after his visit to the United States, this attempt is also very obvious. However, the results of the talks showed that Kishi Nobusuke did not gain much political capital. Kishi Nobusuke naturally cannot and is unwilling to represent the will of the Japanese people to confront the United States on an equal footing in order to strive for an equal position; even as a spokesman for Japanese monopoly capital, his backbone is not straight. Therefore, in this meeting, Kishi Nobusuke neither made Japan step out of its original status as an "unequal partner" of the United States; nor did the United States loosen the screws controlling Japan. Although Kishi Nobusuke and Eisenhower both said many nice things like "friendship" and "cooperation," this does not help eliminate the contradiction between the Japanese people and the U.S. aggressive forces, as well as the "disharmonious tunes" between the monopoly capital of the two countries. On the contrary, this contradiction and this "disharmonious tune" seem even more obvious.
    The only gain from Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Washington may be that he received President Eisenhower's "exceptional kindness" and played a round of golf with him. But how far can he go with this capital alone in the struggle to stabilize his own political power after he returns to his country?

### 岸信介白打了一场高尔夫球

　　岸信介白打了一场高尔夫球
    日本首相岸信介到华盛顿之后，果然第一天就同美国总统艾森豪威尔打了三个半小时的高尔夫球。共同社在一篇报道里对此特别提了一笔，认为这是艾森豪威尔总统的“破例的好意”，并说这种“好意和欢迎”，使得对岸信介动身前后的美国舆论深为关心的日本政府人士大为“感动”和“似乎松了一口气”。
    然而，打球归打球，谈判归谈判。艾森豪威尔总统在谈判桌上表示的“好意”，似乎不及球场上的那么“破例”。虽然岸信介到华盛顿，一下飞机就表明他“满怀信心地希望”这次访美将有助于“为日美关系的新时期开辟道路”，但是从三天会谈所透露的情况和会谈公报的内容看来，说日美关系“正在进入一个以共同利益和信赖为坚实基础的新时期”，却不过是一句官样文章。
    日本人民的强烈愿望和最大的利益，是独立自主，是废除日美不平等条约，是取消军事基地、撤退美国驻军、收回冲绳等等。但是关于这些问题，日美会谈公报，或者含糊其词，得拖且拖；或者由美国作出了少许算不得“让步”的许诺，却换取了对日本重整军备的更紧的督促和催逼。例如，关于美日安全条约，公报只说，美日双方已经取得协议，成立一个政府之间的委员会，来研究在美日安全条约方面发生的问题。不仅日本人民要求废除这一不平等条约的愿望根本没有受到考虑，就是岸信介透露出来的希望美国允许对美日安全条约作一次“重大的修改”的要求，似乎也没有得到多少认真的考虑。
    在驻军问题上，美国答应“在明年以内大大减少驻日本的美国军队的人数，包括迅速撤退所有的美国地面战斗部队”，这在会谈公报里可以算作是一条独无仅有的带有具体内容的条文了。但是如果考虑到最近发生的台北人民的反美大示威，日本人民由于哲腊德事件而激起的反美情绪的高涨，美国原定今年7月1日把远东军司令部和所谓盟军司令部撤离日本，减少美国海外驻军等等因素，美国对日本所作的这一许诺，实际上算不了什么“让步”，只不过是一个顺水人情罢了。而关于撤退美国海空军的问题，会谈公报却只字未提。据消息透露：“美国官员们表示，美国在日本的海空军基地在一个长时间内还将保留，甚至日本完成了重新武装计划以后，也“并不意味着”“美国基地将是不必要的”。这究竟意味着什么呢？这意味着日本能够从它的领土上取消外国军事基地、抹掉这半被占领的耻辱的烙印的日子，是被推到遥遥无期的将来去了。
    同样被推到遥遥无期的将来的，是把琉球群岛归还给日本的问题。艾森豪威尔认为：只要远东“紧张局势”存在，美国在琉球群岛就“有必要继续保持现状”。而美国的战后世界政策，一向是以反共为口实，以制造紧张局势为手段，来达到它的压制民族独立、推行新殖民主义的目的的政策。所以，在艾森豪威尔看来，远东的“紧张局势”将会永远存在；而琉球群岛，包括冲绳岛在内的归还问题，也就无疑等于被判处了无期徒刑。
    岸信介提出的日本加强军备的计划，受到了美国的欢迎。同时，岸信介在美国还一再表白了他的反共立场，作出一副甘愿充当美国反共十字军的马前卒的姿态。人们会看到：岸信介把日本更紧地拴在美国的战车上，将会引导日本人民走向一条多么危险的充满灾难的道路！
    岸信介表白他的反共立场，表示愿意在亚洲反共体制中充当美国的代理人，原是想借此取得美国的赏识，以便伸手向美国要钱，实现他的“亚洲开发基金计划”，以满足日本垄断资本借助于美国资本的力量向东南亚进出的宿愿。岸信介对于这点虽然抱有很大希望，事先作了充分准备，可是美国却自有美国的算盘，对于岸信介的这个计划，只表示要“研究”而已。至于日本要求美国对它开放美国国内市场问题，艾森豪威尔表示“不施加不必要的和任意的限制”。其实，这无非是一句空话。因为凡有限制，都可以认为是“必要的”。
    岸信介打着调整日美关系的招牌到美国去，是想用日本加强军备的计划和对美国“忠诚”“合作”的表示，换取美国的某些让步，以缓和国内人民日益增涨的反美情绪，稳定自由民主党的政权。从岸信介把改组他的内阁放在访美之后这一点来看，这种企图也是很明显的。但是会谈结果表明，岸信介并没有捞取到多少政治资本。岸信介自然不能，并且也不愿意代表日本人民的意志，同美国分庭抗礼，以争取一个平等的地位；就是作为日本垄断资本的代言人，他的腰杆也没有挺直。因此，在这次会谈中，岸信介既没有使日本从原来的作为美国的“不平等的伙伴”地位脱出一步；美国也没有把控制日本的螺丝钉扭松。尽管岸信介同艾森豪威尔都说了不少“友好”“合作”之类的好听话，但是这丝毫无助于消除日本人民同美国侵略势力之间的矛盾以及日美两国垄断资本之间的“不谐和的调子”。相反的，这种矛盾和这种“不谐和的调子”却显得更加明显了。
    岸信介的这次华盛顿之行，唯一的收获也许就是承蒙艾森豪威尔总统的“破例的好意”，一同打了一场高尔夫球吧。但是光凭这点资本，在他回国之后稳定自己的政治势力的斗争中，究竟能走多远呢？
