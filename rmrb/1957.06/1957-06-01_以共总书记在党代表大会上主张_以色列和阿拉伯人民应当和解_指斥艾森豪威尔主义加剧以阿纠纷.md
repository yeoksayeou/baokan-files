Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, May 30th: According to TASS, Israeli Communist Party General Secretary Shmuel Mikunis, in his report at the 13th Congress of the Israeli Communist Party on May 29th, said that the purpose of the Eisenhower Doctrine is to impose a colonial enslavement system on Middle Eastern countries, and Israel's acceptance of this doctrine is tantamount to abandoning political independence.

Mikunis sharply criticized the Ben-Gurion government's decision to agree to the Eisenhower Doctrine, saying that this step betrayed the highest national interests of Israel.

Mikunis said that the Eisenhower Doctrine will perpetuate the Arab-Israeli conflict created by imperialism; imperialism is using this conflict to infringe upon the peaceful interests of the Israeli and Arab peoples. Mikunis accused the Ben-Gurion government of not informing the people about the Soviet proposals on easing tensions in the Middle East and resolving all disputes in the region through peaceful consultation, and that the Ben-Gurion government ignored these proposals.

In analyzing the situation in the Middle East, Mikunis said that the struggle of the Arab peoples against colonialism, against the Baghdad Pact, and against the Eisenhower Doctrine is increasing. This is a characteristic of the situation in the Middle East. The heinous attack on Egypt after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, the blatant interference in Jordan's internal affairs, Richards' visit, and the intimidation by the US Sixth Fleet have not frightened the peoples of various countries into abandoning their struggle for independence. On the contrary, these events have promoted their resistance to imperialist conspiracies.

Mikunis condemned the Israeli ruling clique for even colluding with French and British colonialists to launch a military adventure against Egypt. The result of the Sinai War showed the bankruptcy of the policy of relying on imperialist support and demonstrated the failure of the war policy and the policy of "strength" towards Arab countries. Mikunis said that the Israeli Communist Party's opposition to the aggression against Egypt was a truly patriotic stance. He said that loyalty to the national interests of Israel is not contradictory to solidarity with the Arab peoples in their struggle against imperialism. These are two aspects of the essence of the Israeli Communist Party—a party of Israeli patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

Mikunis said that the Israeli-Arab conflict will only benefit imperialism and its servants in Israel and the Arab countries, and will be harmful to both the Arab and Israeli peoples. This conflict and the Baghdad Pact are important tools of colonialist policy in the Middle East and are the source of tension and disputes in the region.

Mikunis demanded a just and peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue. He said that this issue is the root cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Mikunis continued: In order to justly resolve the Palestinian issue, and in order to peacefully resolve the Arab-Israeli issue, Israel must recognize the right of self-determination of the Palestinian Arab people and recognize the natural right of Arab refugees to return to their homes. He declared that the Israeli Communist Party welcomes any peace agreement between Israel and the Arab countries that is acceptable to both sides and that takes into account the legitimate national rights of the Israeli and Arab peoples. Mikunis also called on the Israeli people, who hate war, to stand up and demand a halt to atomic weapons testing, to oppose the revival of German militarism that killed six million Jews, to oppose the appointment of Nazi General Speidel as commander of NATO's European ground forces, and to oppose the Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine.

    以共总书记在党代表大会上主张
    以色列和阿拉伯人民应当和解
    指斥艾森豪威尔主义加剧以阿纠纷
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫30日讯：以色列共产党总书记舍穆勒·米库尼斯在5月29日以色列共产党第十三次代表大会上所作的报告中说：艾森豪威尔主义的目的是要把殖民奴役制度强加于中东国家，以色列接受这一主义就等于是放弃政治独立。
    米库尼斯尖锐地抨击了本—古里安政府同意艾森豪威尔主义的决定，并且说，这一步骤背叛了以色列的最高民族利益。
    米库尼斯说，艾森豪威尔主义将使帝国主义制造出来的阿拉伯—以色列纠纷长期存在下去；帝国主义正在利用这种纠纷来侵犯以色列人民和阿拉伯人民的和平利益。米库尼斯指责本—古里安政府不让人民知道苏联提出的关于缓和中东紧张局势、通过和平协商解决这一地区一切纠纷的建议，而且本—古里安政府忽视了这些建议。
    米库尼斯在分析中东局势的时候说，阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义、反对巴格达侵略条约和反对艾森豪威尔主义的斗争日益增强。这是中东局势的特点。在埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后对埃及发动的罪恶进攻，对约旦内政的粗暴干涉，理查兹的访问和使用美国第六舰队的恫吓，并没有使各国人民害怕而放弃他们争取独立的斗争。相反，这些事情促进了他们对帝国主义阴谋的反抗。
    米库尼斯谴责以色列统治集团甚至同法英殖民主义者勾结，对埃及发动了一次军事冒险，西奈战争的结果表明了依靠帝国主义支持的政策的破产，表现了战争政策和对阿拉伯各国人民实行“实力地位”政策的失败。米库尼斯说：以色列共产党反对侵略埃及是真正爱国的立场。他说：忠于以色列民族利益同声援阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争并没有矛盾。这是以色列共产党——以色列爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的政党——的本质的两个方面。
    米库尼斯说，以色列和阿拉伯的纠纷只会对帝国主义和它们在以色列和阿拉伯的仆从有利，对阿拉伯人民和以色列人民都是有害的。这一纠纷和巴格达条约都是殖民主义政策在中东的重要工具，都是这一地区紧张局势和各种纠纷的根源。
    米库尼斯要求公正地和平解决巴勒斯坦问题。他说，这个问题是阿拉伯以色列纠纷的根源所在。
    米库尼斯接着说：为了公正地解决巴勒斯坦问题，为了和平地解决阿拉伯同以色列的问题，以色列必须承认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的自决权利，承认阿拉伯难民可以返乡的天然权利。他宣布：以色列和阿拉伯之间任何和平协议只要是双方能够接受的，并且能够考虑到以色列人民和阿拉伯人民正当的民族权利，以色列共产党都表示欢迎。米库尼斯还呼吁憎恨战争的以色列人民起来要求停止原子武器试验，反对曾经杀害六百万犹太人的德国军国主义复活，反对任命纳粹将军斯派达尔担任北大西洋公约组织欧洲地面部队司令，反对杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义。
