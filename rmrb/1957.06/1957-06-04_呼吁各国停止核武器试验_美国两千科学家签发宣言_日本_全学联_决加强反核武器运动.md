Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Public movements in various countries demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing have seen new developments.

    United States
    Since American Nobel Prize winner and biochemist Pauling initiated the signature campaign for the "Appeal by American Scientists to Governments and People of All Countries" demanding a halt to nuclear weapons testing, he collected signatures from two thousand scientists for the declaration in just four days, from May 29th to June 1st.
    The declaration stated that every increase in the amount of nuclear radiation poses a threat to the health of all mankind. As scientists, they have a special responsibility to make this danger known to the world. The declaration called on governments of all countries to conclude an international agreement now to stop nuclear weapons testing.
    Signatories to the declaration included Nobel Prize winners Muller and Ehrenberg, President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Snyder, as well as about a thousand biologists and many chemists, biochemists and physicians.
    Japan
    The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations ("Zengakuren") demanded the strengthening of the anti-nuclear weapons movement at its 10th Congress held in Tokyo on the 3rd.
    Officials of "Zengakuren" announced at the congress, attended by about six hundred representatives, that they plan to form a united front with other anti-nuclear weapons groups in the future.
    On the same afternoon, students from several universities demonstrated in front of the British Embassy, demanding that Britain stop testing hydrogen bombs.
    Britain
    The British National Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons organized a march in London on the 2nd to protest hydrogen bomb testing. There were four hundred participants, three-quarters of whom were women. The marchers wore light-colored summer clothes, but each wore something black as a sign of mourning – black socks, black hats, black ties, black gauze, etc. The demonstrators gathered in Hyde Park, marched through the streets to No. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence, and submitted a letter of protest.
    The National Women's Conference announced that an illustrated leaflet it issued against hydrogen bomb testing has been welcomed throughout the country. The Women's Conference has issued 35,000 leaflets at the request of women across the country. The leaflet called on women to express their protest with concrete actions: write letters to their members of parliament or visit them, write letters to newspapers, attend local protest rallies, and write letters to Macmillan.
    Uruguay
    Uruguay's "El Popular" published on the 3rd an appeal by Uruguayan writers to the British and American parliaments on the issue of banning atomic weapons and stopping the testing of such weapons. The appeal stated that we are disturbed by the current danger of arms expansion and the threat of atomic war. After seeing the appeal from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the US and British parliaments on the issue of banning nuclear weapons testing, we hope that the proposals put forward in the appeal can be realized as soon as possible, and that US, British and Soviet parliamentary committees can be established as soon as possible to exchange views on possible ways to stop testing and ban atomic and hydrogen weapons. The people of all countries have reason to hope that the three major powers possessing nuclear weapons can reach an agreement on this issue.

    呼吁各国停止核武器试验
    美国两千科学家签发宣言
    日本“全学联”决加强反核武器运动
    本报综合报道　据新华社3日讯：各国公众要求禁止核武器试验运动，又有新的开展。
    美国
    美国诺贝尔奖金获得者、生物化学家保林发起“美国科学家对各国政府和人民呼吁”的宣言的签名运动，要求停止核武器试验以来，在从5月29日到6月1日的短短四天内，他就为宣言收集到了两千个科学家的签名。
    这个宣言说，核子放射数量的每一次增加都会对全人类的健康发生危害。作为科学家，他们有特殊的责任把这种危害公布于世。宣言要求各国政府现在就缔结国际协定，停止进行核武器试验。
    在宣言上签名的有诺贝尔奖金获得者莫勒和埃伦格尔，美国科学发展促进协会主席斯奈德，此外还有约一千名生物学家和许多化学家、生物化学家和医学家。
    日本
    全日本学生自治会总联合会（“全学联”）3日在东京召开的第十届大会上要求加强反对核武器的运动。
    “全学联”的负责人在这次约有六百个代表参加的大会上宣布，今后准备联合其它反对核武器的团体组成统一阵线。
    同日下午，又有几个大学的学生到英国大使馆门前示威，要求英国停止试验氢弹。
    英国
    英国禁止核武器全国委员会2日在伦敦组织了一次抗议氢弹试验的游行。参加者有四百人，其中四分之三是妇女。游行者穿着浅颜色的夏季服装，但是每人都穿戴着一点表示哀悼的黑色的东西——黑袜、黑帽、黑领带、黑纱等。示威者在海德公园集合，穿过大街走到唐宁街十号首相官邸，递交了抗议书。
    全国妇女大会宣布，它发行的一种反对氢弹试验的有插图的传单受到全国各地的欢迎。妇女大会已经应各地妇女的请求发出了三万五千份传单。传单号召妇女们用具体行动表示抗议：写信给他们的议员或者去访问他们，写信给报纸，参加当地的抗议集会，写信给麦克米伦。
    乌拉圭
    乌拉圭“人民报”3日刊载了乌拉圭作家就禁止原子武器和停止试验这种武器问题致英美两国议会的呼吁书。呼吁书说，我们对目前扩充军备的危险和原子战争的威胁感到不安。在看到苏联最高苏维埃就禁止试验核武器问题致美英两国议会呼吁书以后，我们希望呼吁书中所提出的建议能早日实现，美、英、苏议会委员会能早日成立，以便就停止试验和禁止原子武器和氢武器的可能方法交换意见。各国人民有理由希望拥有核武器的三个大国能就这个问题达成协议。
