To the Editor:
    I am a non-Party member. As a Chinese citizen, I must resolutely struggle against Lecturer Wang Zunyi's anti-socialist remarks.
    I admit that there are some Party members who, after the victory of the revolution, gradually developed ideas and styles of arrogance, complacency, and detachment from the masses, such as seeking fame and status, vying for treatment, engaging in sectarianism...etc., which have indeed brought certain losses to the Party. The purpose of the rectification is to help these comrades quickly correct their shortcomings and mistakes, starting from the desire for unity. However, Lecturer Wang Zunyi said that "After the founding of the People's Republic of China... the Communist Party became arrogant, thinking that the world was won by us... the people have no freedom of thought and speech granted by the Constitution." Here I want to ask Lecturer Wang: What is the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by Chairman Mao? Isn't that freedom of thought and speech? Just recalling the Kuomintang rule, an ordinary person who read a progressive book or said a dissatisfied word would be arrested or even killed by secret agents. There is no need to give more examples. Any conscientious Chinese person who thinks about the past and compares it with the present will know whether there is freedom of thought and speech today.
    "...Looking back today, the people of the whole country can also be divided into four classes. The first and most noble class is the Communist Party members, the second is the Communist Youth League members, the third is the democratic parties, and the fourth is the masses... The heads of state organs, schools, and enterprises are also mostly appointed with deputies; the head position is always held by Party members..." It's really strange. I have never seen any newspaper, magazine, or book, or any leader who divided the Chinese people into four classes. In my opinion, there is only one class of Chinese people, and that is "the people." I am a non-Party, non-League member, but like hundreds of millions of people, I can freely study Marxism-Leninism today, freely participate in various elections, and freely breathe on the land of the motherland. I have not felt any inequality between me and Party members, League members, and democratic人士 in terms of political rights or living standards. I don't feel that all the rights granted by the Constitution are just empty words. But why does Lecturer Wang Zunyi list us as the fourth class? Are the heads of state organs, organizations, and schools always Party members? Is Lecturer Wang saying nonsense with his eyes wide open, or does Lecturer Wang simply not know? As far as I can remember, in the central ministries alone, the non-Party members who serve as ministers include: Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Justice Shi Liang, Minister of Communications Zhang Bojun, Minister of Textile Industry Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, and Minister of Health Li Dequan. How can you say that the head position is always held by Party members?
    Lecturer Wang Zunyi also used the "burning of books and burying of scholars," "those who whisper together shall be abandoned in the market," "those who discuss poems and books shall be beheaded," and "those who negate the present with the past shall be exterminated" implemented by Qin after unifying China to compare our Party. I really don't understand what is your position? Please ask Lecturer Wang: In which city of New China have you seen "burning of books and burying of scholars" or "those who whisper together shall be abandoned in the market"? Ask yourself, after liberation, China's cultural and educational undertakings have been greatly improved, and the ideological awareness of the people has also been greatly improved. Please see that in the past seven years, colleges and universities have trained hundreds of thousands of young experts, and workers and peasants have generally received secondary, primary, and literacy education. Can this be compared with the past? I really don't know what Lecturer Wang's intentions are with such remarks.
    "Request Chairman Mao... to step down from your throne, go deep into the countryside, and see the living conditions of the peasants." Lecturer Wang is talking nonsense with his eyes wide open again. Everyone can see from newspapers, magazines, or pictorials that Chairman Mao and other leading comrades of the Party Central Committee often visit factories, rural areas, and construction sites, and also often receive representatives from all regions, all ethnic groups, and all classes of the motherland. Isn't this a fact? What's wrong with the lives of the peasants today? No, it's much better, many times better than the days of "half a year of bran and vegetables and half a year of grain" before liberation. What facts did Lecturer Wang base these remarks on? All conscientious Chinese people will understand that today, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have a happy life and a bright path.
    The Party's rectification is to improve the Party's shortcomings, enhance the unity between the Party and the people, and ensure our happy life and socialist construction. No one is allowed to use this opportunity to sabotage the rectification movement and socialist construction. I am determined to fight to the end against all anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks.

### 王尊一，听听我这“第四等人”的意见

　　王尊一，听听我这“第四等人”的意见编辑同志
    我是一个非党员，作为一个中国人民，我对王尊一讲师的反社会主义言论要作坚决的斗争。
    我承认在党内有一部分党员，在革命胜利以后逐渐滋长了骄傲自满脱离群众的思想和作风，如闹名誉地位，争待遇，搞宗派……等等，确实给党带来一定的损失。整风的目的也就是从团结的愿望出发，帮助这些同志赶快改正自己的缺点和错误。可是王尊一讲师却说成“中华人民共和国成立，……共产党骄傲起来，以为天下是我们打下的……人民那有宪法上赋予的思想、言论自由”。这里我要问王讲师：毛主席所提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是什么？难道不是思想、言论自由吗？只要回想一下在国民党统治时代，一个普通人，看了一本进步书籍，说过一句不满的话，就会遭到特务的逮捕甚至被杀害。不必多举了。凡是有良心的中国人，想想过去，比比现在，就知道今天有没有思想言论自由。
    “……反观今天，全国人民也可分为四等，第一等最高贵的人是共产党员，第二等是共青团员，第三等是民主党派，第四等是群众。……国家机关、学校、企业的首长，也是多设复职、正的总是由党员担任…。”真奇怪，我从来也没有见到过那一份报纸杂志，那一本书籍，那一位领袖，把中国人分成四等。依我看，中国人只有一等就是“人民”。我就是一个非党非团员，可是正如几万万群众一样，我今天能够自由地学习马克思列宁主义，自由地参加各项选举，自由地呼吸在祖国大地上。我没有感觉到我与党员、团员、民主人士，在政治权利上、在生活待遇上有什么不平等。我更没有感觉到宪法上赋予的一切权利是一纸空文。可是为什么王尊一讲师竟将我们列入第四等人呢？国家机关、团体、学校首长总是党员担任的吗？这是王讲师瞪着眼说瞎话呢，还是王讲师根本不知道呢？据我能记得起的，仅在中央各部中，由党外人士担任正部长的就有：水利部长傅作义，邮电部长朱学范，司法部长史良，交通部长章伯钧，纺织工业部长蒋光鼐，文化部长沈雁冰，卫生部长李德全。怎么说正的总是党员担任呢？
    王尊一讲师还举嬴秦统一中国后实行“焚书坑儒”，“偶语者弃市”，“谈论诗书者斩首”，“是古非今者灭族”等等来比喻我们的党。我真不明白，这是什么立场？请问王讲师：你在新中国那个城市见到过“焚书坑儒”，“偶语者弃市”呢？抚心自问，解放后，我国文化教育事业大大的提高了，人民的思想觉悟水平也大大提高了，请看七年来，大专学校培养了几十万的青年专家，工人农民普遍受到中等、初等以及扫盲教育，这难道是过去所能比拟的吗？王讲师这样的论调，真不知居心何在。
    “要求毛主席……走下你的宝座，深入农村，看看农民生活情况。”王讲师又在瞪着眼说瞎话了。大家都可以从报纸、杂志或画报上见到，毛主席和党中央的其他领导同志经常到工厂，到农村，到工地访问，也经常接见来自祖国各个地区，各个民族，各个阶层的代表。这难道不是事实嘛？今天的农民生活有什么不好呢？不，好多了，比解放前那种“半年糠菜半年粮”的日子不知好了多少倍。究竟王讲师是根据什么事实提出这些言论呢？一切有良心的中国人都会明白，今天在党和毛主席领导下，我们有了幸福的生活和光明的道路。
    党的整风是为了改进党的缺点，增强党和人民的团结，保证我们的幸福生活和社会主义建设。决不允许任何人借此机会破坏整风运动，破坏社会主义建设。我坚决要和一切反共、反社会主义的言论斗争到底。
