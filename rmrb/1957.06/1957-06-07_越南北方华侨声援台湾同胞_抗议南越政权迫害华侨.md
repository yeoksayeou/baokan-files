Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 6th: The Preparatory Committee of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese United Association held a meeting in Hanoi on the 5th with more than 600 overseas Chinese participants. At the meeting, two statements were issued: one in support of the patriotic and anti-American struggle of Taiwan compatriots, and the other protesting the persecution of overseas Chinese in South Vietnam by the South Vietnamese regime.

The committee's statement on supporting Taiwan compatriots said that Taiwan is China's sacred territory and the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. The patriotic and anti-American struggle of Taiwan compatriots not only demonstrates the patriotic strength of Taiwan compatriots, but also profoundly educates overseas Chinese, enabling them to further recognize the aggressive face of American imperialism.

The statement protesting the persecution of overseas Chinese by the South Vietnamese regime said that the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese firmly support the statement issued by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China on May 20 regarding the South Vietnamese regime's forced change of nationality for overseas Chinese, and support all measures taken by the Chinese government to safeguard the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese in North Vietnam express their indignation at the South Vietnamese regime's unreasonable persecution of overseas Chinese in the South. The statement expressed firm support for the just struggle of overseas Chinese in South Vietnam to defend their legitimate rights and basic human rights.
