Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 5th. As of yesterday, thirty-four basic construction units in Tianjin, which had serious land waste problems, had returned all 5,600+ mu of idle land to farmers for cultivation. The returned land accounts for more than half of the land originally requisitioned by these units.

According to inspections of seventy-eight basic construction units by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee and the Construction Bureau, the phenomenon of requisitioning more land than needed, requisitioning early and using late, and even requisitioning without using at all, was very serious. In recent years, agricultural production in the suburbs has suffered great losses, and farmers are very dissatisfied to see their originally fertile land being wasted. The Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering School requisitioned more than 60 mu of land in 1954 and immediately fenced it off with barbed wire, but in the past three years, only one teaching building has been built. The Tianjin Civil Affairs Bureau requisitioned 33 mu of paddy fields last year to build a nursing home, but construction has not yet started. Last year alone, the "Guangmang Wanzhang" Agricultural Production Cooperative harvested 20,000 jin less of rice. In addition, there are also cases of land waste where the area occupied is large, but the building area is small, with some reaching a ratio of eight to one (occupying eight mu of land, but the building only occupies one mu).

Since May, after inspection, the basic construction units have begun to return temporarily unused land to farmers. The Tianjin Electrolytic Copper Plant originally requisitioned 40 mu of dry land to expand the factory buildings. After the factory director and the Party branch secretary personally measured and demarcated the site, they handed over the surplus 20 mu of land to the "Huoju" Agricultural Cooperative. The Civil Affairs Bureau also handed over the surplus 15 mu of paddy fields. The state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, Tianjin Normal College and other six units returned more than 1,400 mu of dry land, paddy fields, and gardens originally requisitioned to the farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, June 5th. Many units in Shijiazhuang, Handan, Baoding and other cities in Hebei Province, which occupy too much land for basic construction, have recently returned more than 2,500 mu of vacant land to farmers for cultivation.

In the rectification movement, various units, in conjunction with inspections, criticized the past thinking of being generous in using construction land and requisitioning early but using late. Relevant units also formed special groups to conduct a general inspection of land waste. Then, in the spirit of neither affecting construction nor wasting land, after consultation, the temporarily unused vacant land was returned to the farmers in a timely manner.

### 天津、石家庄、邯郸、保定等市基本建设单位  把闲置土地交还农民耕种

    天津、石家庄、邯郸、保定等市基本建设单位
    把闲置土地交还农民耕种
    新华社天津5日电　到昨天为止，天津市有三十四个浪费土地比较严重的基本建设单位，把五千六百多亩闲置未用的土地全部交还给农民耕种；交还的土地，占这些单位原征用土地的一半以上。
    据天津市人民委员会和建设局对七十八个基本建设单位的检查，多征少用、早征迟用甚至征而不用等浪费土地的现象很严重，几年来使郊区农业生产受到很大损失，农民看到原来自己肥沃的土地被白白荒废，很不满。河北省水利工程学校1954年征用了六十多亩土地，立刻用铁丝网圈起来，但是三年多来只建筑了一幢教学大楼。天津市民政局去年征用了三十三亩稻田，准备建养老院，但到现在还没有施工，只是去年就使“光芒万丈”农业生产合作社少收稻谷两万斤。此外，也还有占地多、建筑面积小的浪费情况，有的竟达八比一（占地八亩，建筑物只占一亩）的比例。
    从5月份以来，各基本建设单位经过检查，开始把暂时不用的土地交还给农民。天津市电解铜厂原征用四十亩旱田扩建厂房，经过厂长和党支部书记亲自在现场丈量划界，把多余的二十亩田交给了“火炬”农业社。民政局也交出了多余的十五亩稻田。国营天津造纸总厂、天津师范学院等六个单位，把原来征用的一千四百多亩旱地、稻田和园地全部交还给了农民。
    新华社保定5日电　河北省石家庄、邯郸、保定等市的不少基本建设占地过多的单位，最近把二千五百多亩空地交还给农民耕种。
    各单位在整风中结合检查批评了过去在使用建设用地方面宽打窄用和早征晚用的思想，并且由有关单位组成专门小组，对浪费土地的情况普遍进行了检查，然后本着既不影响建设又不浪费土地的精神，经过协商，把暂时不用的空闲土地，及时地退还给了农民。
