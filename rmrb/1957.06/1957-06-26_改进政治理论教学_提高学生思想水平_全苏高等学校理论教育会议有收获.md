Improving Political Theory Teaching and Enhancing Students' Ideological Level
Gains from the All-Soviet Union Higher Education Theoretical Education Conference

Moscow Dispatch: The All-Soviet Union Conference of Heads of Social Science Teaching and Research Departments in Higher Education Institutions recently concluded. According to participants, the conference involved a broad exchange of views and was very fruitful.

The conference was divided into three groups: History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Philosophy, and Political Economy. All three groups discussed the teaching syllabus.

The first draft of the syllabus for the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was newly drafted. It was pointed out that the strengths of the initial draft lie in its relatively reasonable periodization, the expansion of the party history during the Soviet era, the strengthening of the exposition of party life and the principles of party leadership, and the re-listing of Stalin's works such as "Problems of Leninism" and "The National Question," as well as reports at various party congresses, as teaching materials. The shortcomings of the initial draft were omissions of some issues. It was proposed that the history of the birth and development of the Communist Parties of various republics and the deeds of outstanding party activists should be included to educate young people.

The teaching syllabi for Philosophy and Political Economy were from last year. It was proposed that the Marxist-Leninist philosophy syllabus should pay attention to studying important issues of modern life, criticizing Western bourgeois philosophy, and discovering contradictions within Soviet society. A philosophy association should be established. The third revised edition of Political Economy should be published as soon as possible.

The following are some of the opinions expressed at the plenary session: First, the working conditions of lecturers should be improved so that they can obtain the necessary reference materials and publish their own works. Second, creative and practical teaching methods should replace dogmatic teaching methods. Third, the selection of lecturers should be strict, avoiding phenomena such as historians teaching political economy. Fourth, although the ideological education of university students has recently improved, lecturers should strengthen the ideological education of university students to protect them from the influence of foreign bourgeois ideas. Fifth, academic research work and teaching work should be combined; an effective way to overcome dogmatism and improve teaching is to enable lecturers to directly participate in creative academic research and to absorb students to participate; national research topics should be planned, divided and cooperated to avoid duplication.

The experience of the Teaching and Research Department of Party History, Dialectical Materialism, and Historical Materialism at the Voronezh Agricultural College was emphasized at the conference because theory can be closely integrated with practice. The content of lectures has been greatly enriched, and the phenomenon of empty preaching has disappeared. Students often engage in debates. Students are not required to only speak correct principles, allowing students to understand the essence of the issue in lively debates. There are ten academic groups under the Teaching and Research Department, with two to three hundred students participating in research each year. Over the years, 260 academic reports and papers have been heard in the groups. The Teaching and Research Department also regularly invites old party members and model workers and peasants from the state to hold discussions. Students also actively participate in agricultural production labor.

　　改进政治理论教学  提高学生思想水平
    全苏高等学校理论教育会议有收获
    本报莫斯科25日电  全苏高等学校社会科学教研室主任会议已于日前闭幕。据参加会议者谈：这次会议广泛地交换了意见，收获很大。
    会议曾经分成苏共党史、哲学、政治经济学三个组进行工作。三个组都讨论了教学提纲。
    苏共党史的教学提纲初稿是新拟的。人们指出：初稿的长处在于，分期比较合理，扩充了苏维埃政权时期的党史，加强了党的生活和党的领导的准则的阐述，重新把斯大林的著作如“列宁主义问题”、“民族问题”，在各次党代表大会上的报告，列为教材。初稿的缺点在于漏掉一些问题。人们提议：应该把各个共和国共产党诞生和发展的历史，把杰出的党的活动家的事迹包括进去，用以教育青年。
    哲学和政治经济学的教学提纲是去年的。人们提议：马列主义哲学提纲中要注意研究现代生活的重要问题，批判西方资产阶级哲学，发现苏维埃社会内的矛盾。要成立哲学协会。要早日出版政治经济学的第三次修正版。
    综合会议上的发言，有如下几种意见：一，应该改善讲师的工作条件，使他们能够得到必需的参考资料，能够印行自己的著作。二，以创造性的多联系实际的教学方法代替教条主义的教学方法。三，挑选讲师要严格，避免请历史家讲授政治经济学之类的现象。四，虽然最近大学生的思想教育已有改善，讲师们还应该加强对大学生的思想教育，使他们免受外来资产阶级思想的影响。五，学术研究工作和教学工作应该结合起来；克服教条主义和改善教学的有效方法，使讲师直接参加创造性的学术研究，并且吸收学生们参加；全国研究题目要有计划，分工协作，避免重复。
    沃朗涅兹农学院党史、辩证唯物论和历史唯物论教研室的经验，在会议上受到重视，因为理论能密切结合实际。讲演的内容大大充实了，空洞说教的现象绝迹了。学生们经常进行辩论。并不要求学生只讲正确的道理，让学生们在活跃的争论中了解问题的实质。教研室下面有十个学术小组，每年有二、三百学生参加研究。几年来在小组中听取了二百六十种学术报告和论文。教研室还经常邀请本州的老党员和工农业模范来座谈。学生们也积极参加农业生产劳动。
