　　Fujian White Fungus Production Increases
    The famous Fujian specialty—white fungus from Zhao'an, Pinghe, Yunxiao, Hua'an, and Nanjing—is beginning to be marketed in large quantities. Supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas are setting up locations to begin purchasing.
    After the Longxi Special District emphasized the diversification of economic crops this year, agricultural cooperatives in various locations organized experienced veteran farmers to cultivate white fungus. Now, the white fungus, which grows parasitically on the original wood of Liquidambar formosana trees, appears crystal clear and glistening when viewed from afar. According to estimates from the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the total production in the entire district could reach over 20,000 taels, more than double the production from last year.
    White fungus is a valuable tonic among edible fungi, with the effect of moistening the lungs and cleansing the intestines. The first batch of top-quality white fungus has already been shipped from the producing areas to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, for consumption by overseas Chinese.

　　福建银耳增产
    驰名的福建特产——诏安、平和、云肖、华安、南靖等地白木耳开始大量上市，这些地区的供销社正在设点开始收购。
    龙溪专区今年强调多种经济作物后，各地农业社组织了有经验的老农培植白木耳。现在，附生在溪沙枫树原木上的白木耳颜色一片晶莹，远处眺望，闪闪发亮。据专区供销社估计，全区总产量可达二万多两，比去年增产二倍多。
    白木耳系食用菌类的贵重补品，有润肺清肠的功效。第一批上等银耳已由产区装运至香港、马来亚、新加坡和菲律滨各地，供华侨食用。  （李力、张善籙）
