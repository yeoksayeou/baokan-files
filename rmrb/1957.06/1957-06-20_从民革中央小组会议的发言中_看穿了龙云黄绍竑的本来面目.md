Editor's Note: The situation of the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the 18th has been published on page 5 of this newspaper on the 19th. Those who spoke at the meeting included Li Jishen, Chen Shaoxian, Wang Kunlun, Cheng Qian, Gan Cisen, Xu Wentian, Xiong Kewu, Wu Maosun, Liu Wenhui, Nie Hong, Chen Jianchen, Ning Wu, Chen Qiyuan, Jiang Guangnai, Tang Shengzhi, Yu Zhenying, Ding Guitang, Li Junlong, Zhang Youjiang, Zhao Zukang, and Luo Jiezi, a total of twenty-one people. The speeches of Li Jishen, Wang Kunlun, Cheng Qian, Wu Maosun, and Liu Wenhui are now published as follows:

Li Jishen Accuses Long Yun's Anti-Soviet Fallacies
Exposes Huang Shaohong's Smearing of the Party and Government Everywhere

Li Jishen said that our comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang are helping the Chinese Communist Party in its rectification campaign with the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, and we have put forward many well-intentioned criticisms and useful suggestions, which will definitely help the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign. I think the Chinese Communist Party will also accept and deal with them. However, some comrades have put forward wrong opinions, even reactionary arguments. This is detrimental to the cause of socialism and detrimental to the people. We cannot but refute them.

Comrade Long Yun issued absurd arguments of doubting the Soviet Union, even thinking that the Soviet Union is inferior to the U.S. imperialism. I think this argument is deviating from the socialist camp, violating the national policy of "leaning to one side," and violating the testamentary teaching of the Three People's Principles of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the two major countries, is a powerful guarantee for defending world peace, defending China's socialist construction, and defending the happy lives of the Chinese and Soviet people. The Soviet Union helped us defeat Japanese imperialism, helped us overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule supported by U.S. imperialism, and helped us build a great socialist cause. The Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance is a fact known to everyone in the country. Why does Comrade Long Yun want to obliterate this fact? I demand that Comrade Long Yun honestly and profoundly conduct self-criticism.

Comrade Huang Shaohong has consistently made people feel that he does not take a joyful and encouraging attitude towards the great achievements made by the Chinese people since the founding of the People's Republic of China, but rather looks for faults everywhere, giving the impression of smearing the face of the Party and the government. Even if he thinks he is loyal to his duties and acting in good faith, the objective facts are the opposite. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign has achieved a great victory, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Comrade Huang Shaohong is blind to this and does not mention a word, but insists on emphasizing shortcomings and looking for examples of deviations everywhere, as if he were today's Bao Zheng, but in fact, he is making people see that he is speaking for counter-revolutionaries.

Comrade Huang Shaohong believes that the Party should not issue orders to the masses. As everyone knows, the Party is the core of national leadership. Why can't the Party speak directly to the masses? Is Comrade Huang Shaohong intentionally isolating the Party from the masses? I also hope that he will honestly conduct self-criticism. At the same time, I hope that comrades will, in the spirit of loving people with virtue, criticize the erroneous thoughts of Comrades Long Yun and Huang Shaohong.

Our help to the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign is to oppose bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Now, right-wing elements are taking this opportunity to oppose the leadership of the Party, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, and oppose the socialist system. We have nothing in common with them. We must strictly draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements.

The process of our helping the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign is also the process of improving our own understanding. We must strengthen ideological transformation and fight the right-wing elements to the end.

Wang Kunlun Questions Long Yun:
Are We Not Fighting for Socialism, But for Capitalism?

Wang Kunlun refuted Long Yun's anti-Soviet fallacies by quoting other people's words.

Long Yun believes that "the expenses of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, all borne by China, are unreasonable." Wang Kunlun said that the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was China's war against the United States, and also a war in which the socialist camp opposed the invasion of the imperialist camp, a just war. How could we have won the war without the help of the Soviet Union. During World War II, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, the war wounds were extremely heavy, and we never shared the burden for the Soviet Union! Now the Soviet Union is developing atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles, strengthening the socialist camp's anti-aggression forces, can we afford to share the burden together! Socialist countries are closely related and support each other, and the Soviet Union helps other countries the most, but instead, it is blamed for not bearing the military expenses of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Is this reasonable?

Long Yun believes that "China's debt to the Soviet Union must be repaid, which is not as generous as the United States." Wang Kunlun said that it seems that Long Yun admires the generosity of the United States very much. Does Long Yun know that the United States not only did not suffer losses in the two wars, but also made a fortune and dug the foundation of its allies. Long Yun said that the Soviet Union is very harsh on us, and we should not fight for socialism. Does Long Yun think that we should rely on the United States and fight for capitalism!

Wang Kunlun also refuted Long Yun's so-called issue of the Soviet Union moving machines from Northeast China and his proposal to reduce foreign aid (see page 5 of yesterday's newspaper). Wang Kunlun also criticized Huang Shaohong's reactionary remarks.

A Perilous and Dangerous Stand Due to Greed
Cheng Qian Sternly Criticizes the Political Ambitions of the Right-Wing Elements

In his speech, Cheng Qian pointed out that the recent meeting is developing in a positive and healthy direction, but the right-wing sentiment has not been fundamentally reversed, and the speeches of the right-wing elements have not been met with profound and forceful counterattacks. He believes that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's symposium should reverse this situation and launch a debate on the rights and wrongs of the incorrect, right-wing, erroneous, and even reactionary remarks made by some members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

Cheng Qian believes that Long Yun's echoing of Zhang Bojun's fallacies cannot be excused by "blindly admiring his spirit of speaking," and there is an ideological root cause of resonance between them. He said: Comrade Long Yun, as the Vice-Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Committee, and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, made erroneous opinions at a very serious meeting, which cannot be tolerated. Eight years have passed since liberation, and after experiencing so many movements, Comrade Long Yun himself participated in the discussion, formulated the constitution, and raised his hand to pass the constitution. It is also intolerable that he expresses ignorance and doubt about the country's basic foreign and domestic policies. Comrade Long Yun stated at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang that he felt depressed after attending the symposium of the United Front Work Department because the opinions of the speakers were not getting tighter, but rather looser. May I ask Comrade Long Yun, what kind of tightness do you want? You said that the past few major movements were all about the Communist Party rectifying people. What does this mean? Is it that now that you are helping the Party rectify its work style, you want to tighten it up a bit and rectify the Communist Party firmly?

Comrade Huang Shaohong blames people for saying: "Achievements are the main thing, and deviations and errors are individual cases," "will mean emphasizing achievements to cover up errors." When people counter his opinions, he still dodges and only admits that this erroneous argument "has linguistic problems." Comrade Chen Mingshu said, "Only mentioning shortcomings and not mentioning achievements is in line with the spirit of rectification." Comrade Tan Tiwu called on people to tell the "truth," but when Comrade Lu Yuwen spoke some fair words in a calm manner, Comrade Tiwu said to him sternly that he was shameless. The true meaning of her "truth" is to ask people to only talk about shortcomings and not talk about achievements. Although the language and tone of these three comrades are different, they are essentially the same thing, that is, intentionally not looking at achievements, intentionally obliterating achievements, intentionally looking for shortcomings, and intentionally exaggerating shortcomings. If these three comrades calmly read the editorial "Is It a Matter of Standpoint?" in the People's Daily on June 14, they will definitely be chilled to the bone and realize that they have fallen into the smelly pit of the right-wing elements who slander the new society. Some people say that Comrade Huang Shaohong specializes in finding faults and likes to stand up for others. Of course, we do not oppose contacting the masses, and we also believe that reflecting opinions is the duty of the people's representatives. But you are so enthusiastic about finding faults. May I ask, who are you finding faults with? You are so enthusiastic about standing up for others. May I ask, what injustice are you standing up for? The Eleventh Young Master of "Baishuitan" does have some kung fu, but he hit his own people with a stick, which makes his relatives sad and his enemies happy. What kind of righteous person is this? You have received many letters from people asking for "rehabilitation." Who wrote them? Have you analyzed them? They don't write to others, but only write to you. Why is this? Have you considered it? Your remarks, your views on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and your views on the issue of the legal system can only lead to one conclusion: you don't believe in the Party, and you doubt the Party.

Comrade Chen Mingshu is very interested in abolishing the Party committee leadership in schools. I am also puzzled by your views. How many professors have you talked to? What kind of people have talked to you? How many people can their opinions represent? Who should lead after the Party leadership is abolished? What did it mean to call for reactionary parties and groups to withdraw from schools in the old society? What does it mean to call for the Communist Party to withdraw from schools in the new society? What consequences will occur if the Communist Party withdraws from schools? Have you thought about all these issues?

Comrade Tiwu has a heart for sensationalism. The four opinions she expressed on the issue of the national system, the issue of the legal system, and the issue of the relationship between the Party and the government, from the marrow of her bones, are a thorough opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and are reactionary. Comrade Tiwu still thinks she is a leftist. In my opinion, Comrade Tiwu is a very reactionary right-wing element. Comrade Tiwu claims to look down on Comrade Lu Yuwen, so she also looks down on Comrade Lu Yuwen's remarks in support of the Communist Party and socialism. At the recent symposium, Comrade Tiwu was still settling Comrade Lu Yuwen's "old scores," avoiding the current sharp political issues, and turning the spearhead to elaborate on his history. If we want to settle the "old scores" of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang comrades, I don't think Comrade Tiwu can shoulder this responsibility.

Cheng Qian said that he put forward such questions and views to illustrate:

First, there is a division of left, middle, and right wings in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and this fact should not be ignored. I think that on the one hand, we must distinguish ourselves from the thoughts of the right-wing elements; on the other hand, as Vice-Chairman He Xiangning earnestly pointed out: We have a responsibility to help the right-wing elements and cannot let them remain in the right-wing state for a long time.

Second, when conducting a major debate on the major issues of right and wrong between socialist and non-socialist ideology, our Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the chairman, vice-chairmen, and the collective of the Central Committee should express their attitude clearly. Within the Party, what we support and what we oppose; outside the Party, what we support and what we oppose, must be given a definite answer. Only by showing the drum and the flag brightly can we give a clear explanation to the masses and to society.

Third, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is a political party that takes the socialist road. Our party should supervise, inspect, and educate its members, and engage in political activities based on the principles of socialism. All irresponsible and reckless remarks and nonsense, although we can declare that they have nothing to do with the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, cannot but have a negative political impact objectively. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang cannot ignore this.

Fourth, all the erroneous remarks and actions of the right-wing elements are, in the final analysis, a matter of standpoint. We all come from the old society. When we were young, we engaged in political activities with a simple idea of worrying about the country and the people and loving the country and the people. Later, we ran into walls, stumbled, and groped hard before embarking on the socialist road of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party. Marxism was learned in middle age and old age. It is not a matter of overnight to move our buttocks and change our standpoint. We must make arduous efforts. But we must realize that if the standpoint is not changed and the direction is not clear, we will make mistakes in politics sooner or later. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, we must change our standpoint. Some of our comrades retain the standpoint of the bourgeoisie, thinking that they are smart, but in fact, they are extremely foolish. Because the standpoint of the bourgeoisie itself determines that they are short-sighted and ignorant. Taking trees for forests, generalizing from the specific, using a spot to represent the whole, using the false to break the real, using the non- to break the yes, using the false to break the true, using the evil to break the good, using the ugly to break the beautiful, using the partial to break the whole, using illusions to break facts, etc., are all determined by the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, when observing problems, handling problems, and engaging in revolutionary political activities, if we retain this standpoint, we will fail in everything. The political activities of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have a flavor of "looking at things from a high place and acting in dangerous places." This is determined by their bourgeois selfishness and greed. If they do not abandon this standpoint, they will become more and more dangerous and eventually enter a dead end. The remarks of some of our comrades coincide with the views of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. They are unconsciously acting as echoers, tails, and lackeys. They must look back and reflect deeply. Some people are consciously singing in harmony with them. They should check themselves carefully, consider them, and transform themselves.

Wu Maosun Lists a Series of Facts
Exposing Long Yun's Opposition to Socialism in Thought and Emotion

In his speech, Wu Maosun first refuted Long Yun's anti-Soviet fallacies. Then, he listed a series of facts to illustrate that although it has been eight years since liberation, Long Yun still maintains the thoughts, feelings, and standpoints of the landlord class. In fact, Long Yun still harbors resentment towards the land reform. It has been eight years since liberation, and the hats of many landlords have been removed, but Long Yun's landlord class thoughts and feelings are still attached to him. He usually says that the land reform struggle was too fierce, and now everyone has been rectified into poverty. He also essentially disapproves of agricultural cooperativization. He said that it was done too fiercely last year, emphasizing that people starved to death here and starved to death there. He holds a skeptical attitude towards the improvement of farmers' lives and the superiority of cooperativization. As for the joint state-private ownership and the transformation of industry and commerce, he has a wonderful theory. He said that the Communist Party's method is to rectify everyone, bankrupt everyone, and make everyone poor and without food. He said that the private shares are very pitiful, totaling only more than 2 billion yuan. How much can each of the 600 million people in the country get? It's really pitifully poor! According to Long Yun, the small amount of private shares in the country shows that the country is poor. Whose "country" is this? According to Long Yun's logic, agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce are the root causes of all phenomena such as rectification, bankruptcy, poverty, inability to buy things, and even starvation to death. Can people who have these ideas be said to approve of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce? As for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, Long Yun has always been dissatisfied, talking about a lot of deviations and errors, full of complaints and anger. These are enough to show that Long Yun's first ideological root is opposition to socialism; in thought and emotion, he does not like socialism.

Secondly, we need to ask, does Long Yun like the leadership of the Communist Party? The Communist Party wants to lead the socialist cause. Long Yun does not like many of the socialist methods at all, so of course it is impossible for him to like the Communist Party so much. In the past eight years, Long Yun's remarks, whether public or private, have been mostly criticisms, dissatisfaction, and scolding. Has he rarely "praised" our great achievements in the past eight years? Long Yun once publicly said that he admired Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others, saying that he admired their spirit of "offering opinions." I don't think it is the spirit of "offering opinions," but the spirit of "opposing the leadership of the Communist Party"? It should be admitted that Long Yun's second ideological root is opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party; in thought and emotion, he does not like the Communist Party.

Finally, because Long Yun has the ideological foundation of opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, it is not difficult for us to find the central ideological root of his speech this time, which is opposition to the Soviet Union.

Why does Long Yun want to settle accounts with the Soviet Union? On what basis does he settle accounts? Just as the right-wing elements are using the rectification movement to clamor to settle the "internal accounts" of the Communist Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the three-anti and five-anti movements, and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, Long Yun talks about "settling external accounts," which is a wonderful strategic coordination for the right-wing elements!

People cannot help but ask, why doesn't Long Yun settle accounts with imperialism? Why didn't the people of Yunnan settle accounts with Long Yun?

Finally, Wu Maosun requested the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to seriously deal with Long Yun's mistakes and thoroughly criticize Long Yun's reactionary thoughts.

Liu Wenhui Points Out
Long Yun's Mistake Is a Matter of Class Standpoint

In his speech, Liu Wenhui said that Long Yun's mistake is a matter of class standpoint. Like me, Long Yun was against Chiang Kai-shek in the past and inclined towards revolution and participated in the revolution. However, being against Chiang Kai-shek is not a class standpoint. Our opposition to Chiang Kai-shek is fundamentally different from the Communist Party's opposition to Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, in order to maintain our own strength in the local area, we had to unite all anti-Chiang forces in order to survive. The Communist Party was a huge anti-Chiang force in the country at that time, so we united with the Communist Party. This may be the general situation of most of the comrades present. What is particularly worth mentioning here is that at that time, we united with the Communist Party, but did not accept the leadership of the Communist Party. There is a principled difference between uniting with the Communist Party and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, which is a matter of standpoint.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we successively participated in the government and accepted the leadership of the Communist Party. This can be said to be an important change of standpoint. However, this is just a beginning. At the beginning of the founding of the country, everyone accepted the leadership of the Communist Party. On the one hand, it can be said to be a good start, but on the other hand, it has not taken root in ideology and consciousness. Most of it is the general trend and cannot but be so. Therefore, accepting the leadership of the Party cannot be well implemented in practice.

He said that the reason why he wanted to trace back to the problems before liberation was because only in this way can we deeply understand: why we people often have resistance to new things, and why what the Communist Party and the broad masses of the people think is good, we sometimes think is not good. This is a matter of standpoint. Although we have accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and support taking the socialist road, the old standpoints and viewpoints are sometimes still secretly at work. The remarks recently made by Comrade Long Yun showed very erroneous views—especially on Sino-Soviet relations. He believes that it is the old standpoint and old thinking that are at work.

### 从民革中央小组会议的发言中  看穿了龙云黄绍竑的本来面目

专栏：

　　从民革中央小组会议的发言中
　　看穿了龙云黄绍竑的本来面目
    编者按　18日民革中央小组扩大会议的情况，已在19日本报第五版刊出。会上发言的有李济深、陈劭先、王昆仑、程潜、甘祠森、许闻天、熊克武、吴茂荪、刘文辉、聂轰、陈建晨、宁武、陈其瑗、蒋光鼐、唐生智、于振瀛、丁贵堂、李俊龙、章友江、赵祖康、骆介子等二十一人。现将李济深、王昆仑、程潜、吴茂荪、刘文辉的发言，发表如下：
　　李济深指责龙云的反苏谬论
　　揭露黄绍竑到处给党和政府抹黑脸
    李济深说，我们民革同志这次帮助中共整风，本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神，提出很多善意的批评和有益的意见，对于中共整风一定有所帮助，我想中共也一定会接受和处理的。但是，也有一些同志，提出了错误的意见，甚至是等于反动的论调。这是不利于社会主义事业的，不利于人民的。我们不能不予批驳。
    龙云同志发出了怀疑苏联，甚至以为苏联不如美帝国主义的荒谬论调，我认为，这种论调，是离开了社会主义阵线的立场的，是违反“一边倒”的国策的，是违反孙中山先生三大政策的遗教的。中苏两大国友好合作，是保卫世界和平，保卫中国社会主义建设，保卫中国人民和苏联人民幸福生活的强大保证。苏联帮助我们战胜了日本帝国主义，帮助我们推翻了美帝国主义支持的国民党反动统治，帮助我们建设伟大的社会主义事业。苏联这样的伟大无私的帮助，是全国人人皆知的事实。龙云同志为什么要抹煞这个事实？我要求龙云同志老老实实地深刻地自我检讨。
    黄绍竑同志对于开国以来、中国人民所取得的伟大成就，一贯地使人们感觉他不是采取欢欣鼓舞的态度，而是到处找岔子，给党和政府抹黑脸的样子。即使他自以为是忠于职守，出于好意，但客观事实适得其反。肃反运动取得伟大胜利，巩固了人民民主专政，黄绍竑同志对此熟视无睹，一字不提，却一味强调缺点，到处找偏差例子，仿佛是今天的包拯，实际上是使人们看见他在替反革命分子说话。
    黄绍竑同志认为党不应该向群众发号施令。大家知道，党是国家的领导核心，为什么党不能够对群众直接说话？是不是黄绍竑同志有意要党和群众隔离呢？我也希望他老老实实进行自我检讨。同时，希望同志们本着爱人以德的精神，对龙云、黄绍竑两同志的错误思想展开批评。
    我们帮助中共整风，是反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。现在，右派分子则借此机会来反对党的领导，反对人民民主专政，反对社会主义制度。我们和他们毫无共同之点。我们要和右派分子严格划清界限。
    我们帮助中共整风的过程，也就是自己提高认识的过程。我们必须加强思想改造，同右派分子进行斗争到底。
　　王昆仑质问龙云：
　　我们不为社会主义而战，难道要为资本主义而战？
    王昆仑就龙云的反苏谬论，引用了别人的话加以驳斥。
    龙云认为，“抗美援朝战争的经费，全部由中国负担不合理”。王昆仑说抗美援朝是中国对美国的战争，也是社会主义阵营反对帝国主义阵营侵略的战争，是正义的战争。不是苏联帮助我们怎能打胜仗。当二次大战的时候，德国进攻苏联，战争创伤奇重，我们又何曾为苏联分担过！？现在苏联搞原子弹、氢弹、导弹，加强了社会主义阵营反侵略的力量，我们是否共同负担得起！？社会主义国家休戚相关，互相支援，而苏联帮助各国最多，却反要责备苏联没有负担抗美援朝军费，合情合理吗？
    龙云认为，“中国借苏联的债要还，不如美国慷慨大方”。王昆仑说，看来龙云很欣赏美国的慷慨大方，龙云知不知道美国在两次战争中不但并没有损失，而且发了横财，挖了它盟国的墙脚。龙云说苏联对我们真厉害，我们不该为社会主义而战，难道龙云认为我们应该依靠美国，为资本主义而战吗！
    对龙云提出的，所谓苏联从我国东北搬走机器问题，主张压缩对外援助问题，（见昨日本报第五版）王昆仑也作了驳斥。王昆仑还批判了黄绍竑的反动言论。
　　利令智昏的立场险而又险
　　程潜严斥右派分子的政治野心
    程潜在发言中指出，最近会议正在朝着积极健康的方向发展，但右的情绪仍未得到根本性的扭转，右派分子的言论也未受到深刻有力的回击。他认为民革的座谈会应该扭转这一情况，就民革若干成员所发表的不正确的、右的、错误的甚至反动的言论展开是是非非的争论。
    程潜认为，龙云附和章伯钧的谬论，不能以“盲目钦佩他的发言精神”来脱其咎责，这里头还有声气相应的思想根源。他说：龙云同志以民革副主席、国防委员会副主席、人大常委的身份，在一个很严肃的会议上发表错误的意见，这是不能容许的。解放到现在已经八年，经历了这么些运动，龙云同志自己亲身参与了讨论，制定宪法和举手通过了宪法，竟然对国家的对外、对内的基本政策表现无知和表示怀疑，这也是不能容许的。龙云同志在民革中央小组扩大会议上声称，参加统战部的座谈会后反而情绪低落，因为发言人的意见不是步步紧，而是步步松。请问龙云同志，你究竟要什么样的紧法？你说过去几个大运动都是共产党整人，这又是什么意思？是不是现在帮助党整风，你要紧一些，结实整共产党一下？
    黄绍竑同志责怪人们说：“成绩是主要的，偏差错误是个别的”，“会意味着强调成绩掩护错误”，当人们反责他的意见时，自己还是躲躲闪闪，只承认这种错误论点“有语病”。陈铭枢同志说“只提缺点，不提成绩，才符合整风精神”。谭惕吾同志号召人们说“真话”，但当卢郁文同志心平气和地说了些公平话的时候，惕吾同志却又声色俱厉地说人家无耻，她的“真话”的真意，也就是要人家只谈缺点，不谈成绩。这三位同志的语言和口气尽管不同，但实质上是一个东西，就是有意地不看成绩，有意地抹煞成绩，有意地寻找缺点，有意地夸大缺点。这三位同志如果冷静地读一下人民日报6月14日的社论“是不是立场问题？”就一定会不寒而栗，认识到自己已经堕入到诬蔑诽谤新社会的右派分子的臭泥坑里边去了。有人说黄绍竑同志专找岔子，好打抱不平。当然，我们不反对联系群众，我们也认为反映意见是人民代表的职责。但你这样热衷于找岔子，请问你是在找谁的岔子？你这样热衷于打抱不平，请问，你抱打的是什么不平？“白水滩”的十一郎，功夫的确是有一点的，但一棍子打了自己人，为亲者所痛，仇者所快，这算什么见义勇为之人？你接了不少人要求“平反”的信，是些什么人写的？你分析过没有？他们不写给别人，单单写给你，这是为什么？你考虑过没有？你的言论，你对肃反问题的看法，你对法制问题的看法，只能使人得出一个结论：你不相信党，你怀疑党。
    陈铭枢同志对取消学校中的党委领导很感兴趣，我对你的看法也百思不得其解。你究竟和多少教授谈过话？和你谈过话的究竟是些什么人？他们的意见究竟能代表多少群众？取消党的领导之后究竟要谁来领导？旧社会喊反动党团退出学校意味着什么？新社会叫嚷要共产党退出学校又意味着什么？共产党退出学校究竟会发生什么后果？所有这些问题，你都想过没有？
    惕吾同志有哗众取宠之心。她对国家体制问题、法制问题，以及党政关系问题所发表的四点意见，从骨髓里头来看，是彻底的反对共产党的领导的，是反动的。惕吾同志至今仍旧认为自己是左派分子，据我看，惕吾同志是很反动的右派分子。惕吾同志声称看不起卢郁文同志，因此连卢郁文同志拥护共产党和社会主义的言论也看不起了。就在最近的座谈会上，惕吾同志还在算卢郁文同志的“老帐”，回避当前政治上的尖锐问题，掉转花枪来铺陈人家的历史。如果要算民革同志的历史“老帐”，我看惕吾同志担代不起这份责任的。
    程潜说，他把这样一些问题和看法提出来，意在说明：
    第一，民革有左、中、右派的分野，不应当忽视这个事实。我以为一方面要和右派分子的思想分清界限；另一方面，如何香凝副主席语重心长地指出的：我们有责任帮助右派，不能长期让他们处于右派状态。
    第二，在社会主义思想和非社会主义思想的大是大非进行大争大论的时候，我们民革中央领导机关，主席、副主席，中央委员会的集体，应当鲜明地表示态度。在党内，我们拥护什么，反对什么；在党外，我们拥护什么，反对什么，都要作出肯定的回答。堂堂之鼓，正正之旗，亮出来才能向群众、向社会有一个明确的交代。
    第三，民革是一个走社会主义道路的政党，我们的党应该监督、检查、教育自己的成员，要本着社会主义的原则从事政治活动。一切不负责任的大放厥词和胡说八道，虽然我们可以声明与民革无关，但总不能不在客观上产生恶劣的政治影响，对此，民革的中央委员会是不能不过问的。
    第四，所有右派的错误言论和行动，归根结底是一个立场问题。我们都从旧社会来，年青时从事政治活动，只是抱着一种朴素的忧国忧民、爱国爱民的思想，以后碰了壁，摔了跤，苦苦摸索，才走上一条接受共产党领导的社会主义道路。马克思主义是在中年和晚年学的，要把屁股移过来，把立场改过来，不是一朝一夕之功，还要作艰苦的努力。但我们必须认识，立场不转，方向不明，迟早要在政治上犯错误。因此，不管如何艰苦，也要把立场转变过来。我们有些同志保留着资产阶级的立场，自以为聪明，实际是天大的愚蠢。因为，资产阶级的立场本身，就决定了他是眼光短浅、不明事理的。以树木当森林，以偏概全，以一斑代全貌，以虚破实，以非破是，以伪破真，以恶破善，以丑破美，以片面破全面，以幻影破事实，等等，都是资产阶级的立场决定了的。因此，观察问题、处理问题、从事革命的政治活动时，如果保留这个立场，就无往而不失败。章伯钧、罗隆基的政治活动，有些“高处着眼险处行”的味道，这是他们的资产阶级自私自利、利令智昏的立场决定的，如果他们不抛弃这个立场，就会险而再险，最终步入绝境。我们有些同志的言论和章伯钧、罗隆基的观点不谋而合，是不自觉地当了应声虫，当了尾巴，当了狗腿子，这就要回头猛省；有人是自觉地彼唱此和，就更要好好检点一下，考虑一下，改造一下了。
　　吴茂荪列举一系列事实
　　揭穿龙云在思想感情上就反对社会主义
    吴茂荪在发言中，首先批驳了龙云的反苏谬论。接着他列举了一系列的事实，说明虽然解放已经八年了，龙云仍然保持着地主阶级的思想感情和立场。事实上，龙云对于土地改革至今还是余恨未消的。解放八年了许多地主的帽子已经摘了，而龙云的地主阶级的思想感情还依然依附在身上。他平时常说，土改斗争太凶了，现在是大家都被整穷了。对于农业合作化，他实质上也是不赞成的。他说去年搞得太凶了，强调这里饿死人，那里饿死人。他对农民生活的改善，合作化的优越性是抱着怀疑的态度的。对于公私合营、工商业改造，他又有一种妙论，他说，共产党的办法是把大家都整垮、整光，整得大家都穷了，大家都没饭吃。他说私股资金可怜得很，总共不过二十多亿元，全国六亿人口每人能分到多少呢？真穷得可怜啊！照龙云的说法，全国私股资金少就说明了国家穷，这是什么人的“国家”呢？照龙云的逻辑来推论，农业合作化和工商业改造都是整垮、整光、整穷，买不到东西，以至饿死人这一切现象的根源。有这些想法的人，能说是赞成农业合作化和私营工商业社会主义改造吗？至于说，镇反、肃反，龙云是一贯不满意的，说起来偏差错误一大堆，充满了埋怨气愤的情绪。这些就足以说明龙云第一个思想根子就是反对社会主义；在思想感情上是不喜欢社会主义的。
    其次，我们要追问一下，龙云是不是喜欢共产党领导呢？共产党要领导搞社会主义。龙云对于社会主义的许多办法根本不喜欢，当然对共产党就不可能那么喜欢。八年来，龙云的言论，不论公开的、私下的，批评多，不满多，责骂多，很少对我们八年来的伟大成绩来一个“歌功颂德”吧？龙云曾公开说过钦佩章伯钧、罗隆基等人，说钦佩的是他们“提意见”的精神，我看不是“提意见”的精神，而是“反对共产党领导”的精神吧？应该承认，龙云第二个思想根子就是反对共产党领导，在思想感情上，是不喜欢共产党的。
    最后，由于龙云具有反对社会主义，反对共产党领导的思想基础，我们也就不难找到他这次发言的中心思想根子，那就是反对苏联。
    龙云为什么要和苏联算账？凭什么算账？正当右派分子利用整风运动叫嚣要和共产党算镇反、三反、肃反等“内账”的时候，龙云大谈其“算外账”，真是右派分子绝妙的战略配合！
    人们不能不问，龙云为什么不和帝国主义算账？云南的老百姓又为什么没有和龙云算账？
    最后吴茂荪要求民革中央对龙云的错误作严肃处理，对龙云的反动思想作彻底的批判。
　　刘文辉指出
　　龙云的错误是阶级立场问题
    刘文辉在发言中说，龙云的错误是阶级立场的问题。龙云和我一样，过去都是反对蒋介石而倾向革命而参加革命的。但是，反蒋并不是一个阶级立场。我们的反蒋和共产党的反蒋有着根本的不同。当时为了保持自己在地方上的力量，非联合一切反蒋力量无以自存，而共产党是当时国内反蒋的巨大力量，所以，我们联合共产党。这也许是在座的大多数同志的一般情况。这里特别值得一提的是，当时是联合共产党，而不是接受共产党的领导，联合共产党和接受共产党的领导，是有原则差别的事，这也就是立场问题。
    中华人民共和国成立后，我们先后参加了政府，接受共产党的领导。这可以说是一个重要的立场的转变。但是，这还是一个开始。开国之初，大家接受共产党的领导，一方面，可以说是一个良好的开端，但另一方面，在思想意识上，却并未生根，多半是大势所趋，不得不然。因此，接受党的领导，就不能很好的贯彻到实践当中。
    他说他所以要远溯解放前的问题，是因为只有如此才能深入地了解到：为甚么我们这类人常常对新事物会有抵触情绪，为甚么共产党和广大人民以为好的，有时我们会以为不好。这就是立场问题。虽然我们已经接受共产党的领导，拥护走社会主义的道路，但旧的立场观点有时还在暗地作怪。最近龙云同志发表的言论，表现出很错误的看法，——尤其是在中苏关系上，他认为就是旧立场旧思想在起着作用。
