Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 11th: Following Jordan's framing of Egyptian diplomatic personnel, Egypt has demanded that the Jordanian Ambassador to Cairo, Abdul Moneim Rifai, leave Egyptian territory as of June 10th.

This action by Egypt follows closely after the Jordanian government expelled the Egyptian military attache in Amman and the Consul-General in Jerusalem. The Egyptian government issued a statement on the afternoon of June 10th, accusing the Jordanian government of "framing Egyptian diplomatic personnel and fabricating accusations to find excuses to undermine relations between the two countries." The statement said, "The Egyptian government believes it must notify the Jordanian government that it must immediately, and within twenty-four hours, withdraw its ambassador to Cairo."

On June 10th, the Egyptian government also decided to recall its representative to the joint Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian military command in Amman.

The Middle East News Agency reported that the Egyptian government recalled its representative to the joint command to protect its officials who are working for Arab nationalism from fabricated accusations and imperialist conspiracies by the Jordanian government.

The joint Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian command was established according to an agreement reached in Cairo last year by the chiefs of staff of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. Under this agreement, the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan are placed under the unified command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces, Amir.

The tension between Egypt and Jordan, two Arab countries, has surfaced since the Jordanian incident occurred on June 9th when Jordanian authorities falsely accused Egyptian diplomats. Arab political figures in Cairo have expressed concern that the scope of this crisis may widen because the King of Saudi Arabia is currently visiting Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 11th: According to Cairo's "Rose al-Yūsuf" weekly on June 10th, citing a senior Syrian figure, Egypt and Syria will not provide financial aid to Jordan under the Arab Solidarity Agreement until they are sure that Jordan will not request financial aid from Britain.

Cairo newspapers recently reported that Jordan had requested such aid from Britain.

This figure also stated that if Jordan insists on its current policies, Egypt and Syria will have to postpone the implementation of the Arab Solidarity Agreement.

According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper on June 10th, quoting the Jordanian ambassador to Egypt, the Jordanian government has not requested any new economic assistance from Britain. He said that Jordan's request to Britain was for it to pay the arrears on a loan agreed upon by the two countries in 1955. He said that after the end of the Anglo-Jordanian treaty, the payment of the remaining 1.3 million pounds of this loan was suspended.

### 约旦陷害埃及外交人员后　埃及要约旦大使离境　并决定召回驻安曼军事代表

　　约旦陷害埃及外交人员后
　　埃及要约旦大使离境
　　并决定召回驻安曼军事代表
    新华社开罗11日电  埃及已经在6月10日要求约旦驻开罗大使阿卜杜勒·莫奈姆·里法伊离开埃及国境。
    埃及的这一行动是紧接着约旦政府把埃及驻安曼的武官和驻耶路撒冷的总领事驱逐出境以后采取的。埃及政府10日下午发表声明，指责约旦政府“陷害埃及外交人员并且捏造指责来寻找借口破坏两国间的关系”。声明说，“埃及政府认为不得不通知约旦政府，它必须立刻，而且是在二十四小时以内撤回它的驻开罗大使”。
    埃及政府在6月10日还决定召回它驻在安曼埃、叙、约联合军事司令部的代表。
    中东通讯社说，埃及政府召回它驻联合司令部的代表，是为了保护它正在为阿拉伯民族主义而工作的官员，以免遭到约旦政府可能对他捏造的指责和帝国主义的阴谋陷害。
    埃、叙、约联合司令部是根据埃、叙、约三国的参谋长去年在开罗达成的协议建立的。根据这项协议，埃、叙、约三国的军队都置于埃及武装部队总司令阿密尔的统一指挥下。
    6月9日约旦当局诬陷埃及外交官的事件发生后，自从约旦事件以来埃、约两个阿拉伯国家间的紧张关系已趋向表面化。开罗的阿拉伯政界人士表示担心，由于沙特阿拉伯国王目前正在约旦访问，这种危机的范围有扩大的危险。
    新华社开罗11日电  据开罗“鲁兹·优素福”周刊6月10日援引一位叙利亚高级人士的话说，在埃及和叙利亚弄清楚约旦不会向英国要求财政援助之前，它们是不会根据阿拉伯团结协定给予约旦财政援助的。
    开罗报纸最近报道，约旦曾经要求英国给予这样的援助。
    这位人士又说，如果约旦坚持它目前的政策，埃及和叙利亚将不得不延缓执行阿拉伯团结协定。
    据“金字塔报”6月10日援引约旦驻埃及大使的话说，约旦政府没有要求英国给予任何新的经济援助。他说，约旦向英国提出的要求是要它支付两国1955年同意的贷款的欠额部分。他说，在英约条约结束后，曾经停止支付这笔贷款的余下部分一百三十万英镑。
