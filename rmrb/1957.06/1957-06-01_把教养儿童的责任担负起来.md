Take on the Responsibility of Educating Children
Song Qingling

Children are our future, our hope, and the most precious wealth of our country. We must cherish them like seedlings, cultivate them like saplings, prepare all the conditions for their growth, and help them overcome wind, frost, and pests. At the same time, we must also pay attention to correcting any crooked trunks and pruning any unusable branches. Only in this way can these saplings grow strong and upright, withstand wind and frost, and become useful talents.

In recent years, our country has given children the greatest care and love, so that they can only describe their lives as "happy childhoods," making us adults feel comforted and proud when we see our next generation. This is the result of the long-term cultivation and education by our country and all sectors of society—especially parents and children's education workers.

However, in the work of educating children, we have not all fulfilled our due responsibilities. The behavior of adults is a model for children, and they find their living habits and moral standards from the behavior of their elders. The revolutionary struggle and selfless labor of the elders cultivate children to prepare for participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. However, elders often have some bad behaviors that have a bad influence on children. Often, adults only consider some bad habits as minor details of life, but they can easily be seen reflected in children. What's more, there are still a few people in society who deliberately tempt children to do bad things, which cannot but arouse our attention.

Educating the next generation is the responsibility of all of us. First of all, parents must take on this responsibility. Nowadays, some parents believe that educating children is the state's business and that they can let go and not care; some replace education with beatings and scolding; some replace love with doting; and some parents even put pressure and threats on middle and primary school graduates, increasing the children's unnecessary tension in the matter of graduation and further education. These phenomena cannot be allowed to continue to exist. People from the whole society should take responsibility. First of all, parents should learn to correctly educate their children. This is a citizen of the new China's obligation to the country!

Our country is in a period of socialist construction. It is a great and arduous task to lift 600 million people out of poverty and continuously improve the people's material and cultural living standards. This task may not even be completed by our generation. In order to make our next generation worthy successors to our great cause, so that they will be worthy of being the glorious descendants of the revolutionary Chinese people, the wealth we leave them is not only material property, but the most valuable thing is our traditional revolutionary spirit, which is also the spirit of "diligence and thrift, honesty and bravery" in this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day slogan.

"Diligence and thrift, honesty and bravery" are the requirements we put forward to children. But I think we should first put forward this requirement to all adults, because they influence children with their behavior at all times and in all places, and because they bear the responsibility of educating children.

    把教养儿童的责任担负起来
    宋庆龄
    儿童是我们的未来，是我们的希望，是我们国家最宝贵的财富。我们必须像爱护幼苗一样的爱护他们，像栽培小树一样的栽培他们，为他们准备好一切生长的条件，帮助他们战胜风霜虫豸，同时也要注意矫正长得歪曲了的躯干，剪掉不成材的枝丫。只有这样，这些小树才能长得茁壮、正直，才能经得住风霜，才能成长为有用之材。
    几年来，我们的国家给予儿童们最大的关怀和爱护，使他们只能用“幸福的童年”来形容自己的生活，使得我们成年人看到我们的下一代，不能不感到安慰，引为骄傲。这是我们的国家和各方面人士——特别是做父母的和儿童教育工作者长期培养教育所得到的成绩。
    但是在教养儿童的工作上，我们并不是都尽到了应尽的责任。成年人的行为是儿童的榜样，他们从长辈的行为上找到自己的生活习惯和道德的标准。长辈人的革命奋斗，忘我劳动的行为培养儿童们为参加祖国社会主义建设事业作好准备。但是长辈人的身上也常有些不好的行为给了儿童坏的影响，往往成年人只认为生活小节的一些坏习惯，很容易在孩子身上看到反应，更何况现在社会上还有少数人有意引诱儿童作坏事，这不能不引起我们的重视。
    教养下一代是我们全民的责任。首先做家长的要负起这个责任来。现在有些做父母的认为教育儿童是国家的事情，自己可以放任不管；有些人以打骂代替教育；有些人以溺爱代替爱护；甚至有些家长对应届中、小学毕业生施加压力和威胁，增加了儿童们在毕业升学问题上的不必要的紧张。不能让这些现象长久存在下去，全社会的人应该负起责任来，首先做家长的应该学会正确地教养自己的子女，这是作为一个新中国的公民对国家应尽的义务！
    我们的国家正处在社会主义建设时期，使六亿人民摆脱贫困，不断提高人民的物质文化水平，是一件伟大而艰巨的任务，这个任务甚至不是我们一代人能够完成的。为了使我们的下一代能够成为我们伟大事业的接班人，使他们将来无愧于作为革命的中国人民的光荣后代，我们留给他们的财富，就不仅是物质财产，而最宝贵的东西乃是我们传统的革命精神，也就是今年“六一”国际儿童节的口号“勤劳朴素，诚实勇敢”的精神。
    “勤劳朴素，诚实勇敢”，这是我们对儿童提出的要求。但我想首先应该把这个要求向一切成年人提出来，因为他们随时随地以自己的行为影响着儿童，因为他们担负了教养儿童的责任。
