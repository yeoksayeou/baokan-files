　　The Fish Demon's Recitative
　　Liu Xue'an, Chairman of the Beijing Art Normal College Branch of the China Democratic League

　　It is said that in ancient times there was a fish demon in the sea who fattened itself by eating the flesh and blood of working people. It lurked in the depths of reefs with its school of fish. Waiting for passing ships to pass by, it would instruct its lackeys, in groups of three or five, to appear and disappear, transforming into charming young girls in mirages, singing enchanting songs, so that the guests on the ship and the helmsman would be moved by their music, confused, drunk, and infatuated, abandoning their compasses, losing their direction, and crashing into reefs, burying themselves in the seabed, and serving as a sumptuous feast for the fish demons.
　　During this rectification movement, several responsible persons of the China Democratic League, taking the opportunity to offer opinions to the Party, expounded rightist views. For example, Zhang Bojun proposed to establish a Political Design Institute to exclude the Communist Party and, in addition to the CPPCC, to have the democratic parties and people's organizations carry out national decision-making. Luo Longji believed that the Communist Party's work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries had been messed up and wanted to establish a Rehabilitation Committee to check and correct the mistakes made by the Communist Party in the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries. Chu Anping believed that the relationship between the Party and the masses was not good, and the problem lay in the "Party's world" issue. He suggested to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou that the People's Republic of China should be pulled back to the road of the "coalition government" before liberation, or at least let the leaders of the democratic parties sit in the positions of Chairman and Premier of the State Council, as in the period of the Common Program before the promulgation of the Constitution. Chu's "Party's world" opinion was further supported and extended by Chen Xingui, who said that "Party's world" is synonymous with the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of the "three evils." According to the logic of their talks, if the Communist Party wants to rectify the style of work well this time, it must change the state system of people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance, which is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat, organize a Political Design Institute with four parallel national decision-making bodies, gradually disintegrate the leading position of the Communist Party, let the leading figures of the Communist Party step down one by one, and then through the rehabilitation organizations, let them win back "people's hearts," and then make their ideal figures one by one ascend to the throne in the lower, middle, and upper political institutions. Isn't this alarming tune the most prominent theme, the most harmonious sound, and the "quartet hoping for the restoration of a bourgeois democratic polity" in the rectification movement? The melodies sung by each of them are not the same, and the timbres are also different. The time and place of their appearance are not completely the same either. At first, it sounds a bit strange and not very pleasant, but like the polyphonic masters of the seventeenth century, they skillfully connect the various parts in a staggered and intricate way into a fairly complete "bourgeois democratic polity recitative." According to the recent disclosures by Comrades Shi Liang, Shen Zhiyuan, and other comrades, it turns out that there is still a certain inherent connection between this harmonious recitative. First of all, they are all responsible persons of the China Democratic League. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are vice chairmen of the League Central Committee, and Zhang is also the president of Guangming Daily. Chu Anping is the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, and Chen Xingui is an alternate member of the League Central Committee. Chu's speech was approved by Luo Longji and received Zhang's tacit support and encouragement. The composition of this quartet is very intriguing. Secondly, Zhang, Luo, and Chu were all "democratic individualists" on the third line before liberation who were dissatisfied with the Jiang regime and did not fully approve of the Communist Party. Some wanted to organize an army but failed, some wanted to establish a bicameral system but failed, some were ministers but still felt inferior, and some were driven by cars but still harbored dissatisfaction. Now they want to take advantage of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" to develop two million League members as political capital, so as to compete with the leading party on an equal footing and share the spring scenery. They even do not hesitate to violate the Constitution and overthrow the state system, and want to take the bourgeois democratic road. Is this right?! Is this possible?!
　　It has not been ten years since the national liberation, and the people still have fresh memories of the rule of the American-Chiang bandit gang. Everyone knows that restoring the bourgeois democratic polity is in fact restoring the bloody rule of the semi-colonial era of the American-Chiang bandit gang. China's 600 million people have just struggled out of the depths of misery under the leadership of the Communist Party. Although the wounds have healed, the lingering fears remain in the heart. Moreover, the Liu Ziran incident in Taiwan is still in front of us, but these few individualistic ambitious elements want to take advantage of the rectification to carry the banner of expanding democracy and freedom, hoping to plunge 600 million people back into the bloodbath; to give them to the fish demon as a snack for the stomach, this is simply a dream!
　　If the people of the whole country will not be fooled by them, shall we adopt a "don't be surprised, the strange will fail by itself" attitude to treat them? No! Because since liberation, although the Chinese people have undergone countless great political movements and ideological transformations, we cannot blindly optimistically say that all the counter-revolutionary elements have been completely eliminated, and we cannot say that every intellectual has no confused and unclear ideas. For example, Mr. Rong Yiren in Shanghai recently received counter-revolutionary pamphlets, and more people received threatening letters, indicating that there are still some shadowy figures in China who cannot see the light of day. In addition, although the public-private partnership of our entire industry and commerce has been completed, due to the implementation of the policy of fixed interest for redemption, the bourgeoisie still has its material foundation. As for the vast ocean of the petty bourgeoisie, it is only now beginning to be transformed. The thin social foundation of democratic individualism cannot be said to be completely eliminated. If you don't believe it, we can see from the speeches of the people of the democratic parties in this rectification movement, in addition to individual soloists who very prominently represent the political aspirations of the bourgeoisie, aren't there still many people who sympathize with the China Democratic League quartet or even hum along in a low voice? This is the situation in our country. As for the situation abroad, what is it like? I remember that on August 5, 1949, when the American-Chiang bandit gang was about to liberate the whole of China by our People's Liberation Army, when the American ambassador to China, Stuart Leiden, was on his way back to Washington, the US State Department published the White Paper on Sino-US Relations, and the full text of US Secretary of State Acheson's letter to President Truman. In addition to explaining the various reasons for the complete failure of American imperialism in invading China, the two documents mentioned in the White Paper that they hoped to place their hopes on Chinese "democratic individualists" and would encourage them to develop all activities aimed at overthrowing the new people's democratic China.
　　For the enemy's expectations, wanting to use "democratic individualists" as his fifth column to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus fundamentally destroy the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, I cannot see any essential difference between this and the content of this quartet in our China Democratic League organization from the effect. Fortunately, the Party Central Committee has a high foresight and saw early on that there was still a thin social foundation of "democratic individualists" in China at that time, which should be resolutely destroyed, so it did not hesitate to give the White Paper the most severe criticism in the People's Daily again and again and again and again. Moreover, the China Democratic League headquarters also published an article in the People's Daily on August 24, 1949, denouncing the US imperialist White Paper, and also passionately believed that "the liberalists who still have some illusions about the US imperialism will also be awakened by this White Paper. True 'democratic individualists' must love themselves and love the country, and will never sell their motherland and be willing to be slaves to US imperialism." If Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji agreed to the publication of this condemnation in the League Central Committee at that time, what were their true thoughts? Based on their remarks in the rectification, I feel suspicious. Looking again today at the jubilant and respectful situation in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where the American-Chiang bandit gang congratulates Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Chu Anping's speeches, who can say that those expectations in the 1949 White Paper of the American imperialism have not been reflected in them all along? Naturally, although the infection of this recitative, in the rectification movement, pretends to be the coat of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and wants to change the state system and blur the minds of a few people in the country for a while, the great ship of New China, with Chairman Mao of the Central Committee holding the compass of Marxism-Leninism and taking the road of socialism and communism, has gone through many storms and waves, and will never lose its direction in the past, present, and future. What's more, there are thousands of masses under the leadership and education of the Party, who have become astute and can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and can distinguish right from wrong. No matter how beautiful your appearance is disguised, and how charming your song is sung, we have the standpoint of the working class, the materialistic point of view, and the dialectical method. With such a complete set of armed brains and eyes, we can completely observe the original form of the big and small fish demons step by step and deal with it very properly. Now that we have found out the common harmony of their different melodies and the theme they are trying to express, we want to further reveal who is the conductor of their quartet? And is such a recitative performance spontaneous and accidental, or is there a big fish demon behind the scenes pulling the strings? Whether it is organizational or ideological, we hope that these several recitative artists will explain it clearly so that we can thoroughly destroy this thin foundation of "democratic individualists," let the people of the whole country receive a good class education, and they will also be rescued from the fish group that is inextricably linked with the fish demon, thoroughly transform themselves, and serve the people well.

　　鱼妖的重唱曲
　　民盟北京艺术师范学院支部主任委员  刘雪庵
    据说古代海里有一个靠吃劳动人民血肉来养肥自己的鱼妖。她带着自己的鱼群，潜伏在暗礁深处。静候着过往船只经过那儿的时候，她就指使她的喽啰，三五成队，若隐若现，在蜃楼中幻化成娇媚的少女，唱着迷人的歌曲，使船上的客人同掌舵的梢工受她们音乐的感动，糊里糊涂似醉如痴地抛下南针，失去方向，以致撞上暗礁，葬身海底，就充作鱼妖们饱餐的盛馔。
    这次在整风运动中，中国民主同盟有几位负责人，借对党提意见的机会，发挥了右派的言论。如章伯钧提出要成立政治设计院，把共产党除开，于人民政协之外，再由民主党派及人民团体来搞国家的决策工作。罗隆基认为共产党的肃反工作搞坏了，另外想成立一个平反委员会来检查纠正共产党在肃反工作中所犯的错误。储安平认为党群关系不好，毛病是出在“党天下”的问题上，他向毛主席周总理提意见要把中华人民共和国拉转到解放前“联合政府”的道路，至少也得像宪法公布以前共同纲领时期把主席及国务院总理的位置让给民主党派人士坐坐。储的“党天下”意见，更由陈新桂予以支持同引伸。说“党天下”就是无产阶级专政的同义语，而无产阶级专政就是“三害”产生的根源。依照他们谈话的逻辑，共产党这次如果要把风整好，就必须改变工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，实质即无产阶级专政的国体，组织四个平行的国家决策机构的政治设计院，把共产党的领导地位逐层瓦解，让共产党的领导人物次第下台，通过平反组织，由他们来收拾“人心”，然后在下层中层上层政治机构中使他们理想的人物一个一个登上宝座。这种惊心的音调，不正是整风运动当中最突出的一首主题鲜明、声音谐和、“希望资产阶级民主政体复辟的四重唱”么？他们每个人唱的旋律并不相同，音色也各异，他们出台的时间同地点也不完全一致，初先听起来好像有点怪腔怪调不大顺耳，但是他们却像十七世纪复调音乐大师一样，很巧妙地把各个声部参差错综地连缀起来成一首相当完整的“资产阶级民主政体重唱曲”。证以史良同志、沈志远同志及其他同志最近几天的揭发，原来他们这一首合拍的重唱曲，他们相互间仍旧有一定的内在联系。首先他们都是民盟的负责人，章伯钧、罗隆基是盟中央副主席，章还兼光明日报社长之职，储安平是光明日报总编辑，陈新桂是盟中央候补委员。储的发言是得罗隆基的同意，又得章的暗中支持同鼓舞。这首四重唱乐曲的构成，此中蛛丝马迹，很值得耐人寻味。其次如章、罗、储在解放前都是既不满蒋政权又不十分赞成共产党的第三条路线上的“民主个人主义者”。有的想组织军队而未成，有的想成立两院制政体而不果，有的是身为部长而犹嫌屈居人下，有的是以汽车代步而尚心怀不满。现在竟想借“长期共存，互相监督”的政策来发展二百万盟员作为政治资本，好与领导党分庭抗礼，春色共占。甚至不惜违反宪法，推翻国体，想走资产阶级的民主道路，这是应该的么？！这是可能的么？！
    全国解放到现在未及十年，人民对美蒋匪帮统治时期的记忆犹新。每一个人都知道再恢复资产阶级的民主政体，事实就是恢复美蒋匪帮时代半殖民地的血腥统治。六亿人民的中国刚刚在共产党领导下，从水深火热中努力挣扎出来，创痕虽复，余悸在心，何况台湾刘自然的事件还在目前，而这些少数个人主义的野心分子，却想利用整风的机会，掮着扩大民主自由的招牌，希图把六亿人民重新陷入血泊；送给鱼妖作果腹的点心，这简直是痴人说梦！
    是不是全国人民不会上他们的当，我们就采取一种“见怪不怪，其怪自败”的态度来对待他们呢？不行！因为解放以来中国人民虽经过无数伟大的政治运动及思想改造，我们还不能盲目乐观地说反革命分子都已全部彻底肃清，更不能说每一个知识分子都没有糊涂不清的观念。如像最近上海荣毅仁先生就收到反革命的小册子及更多的人收到恐吓信，说明我们中国还有一些见不得天日的阴暗人物存在。另外我们工商界全行业的公私合营虽然完成，但由于赎买定息政策的施行，资产阶级还有他的物质基础，至于汪洋大海的小资产阶级现在才开始改造，民主个人主义那一层薄薄的社会基础，还不能说就完全消灭了，不信我们可以从这次整风运动中各民主党派人士的发言来看，除了个别很突出的代表资产阶级政治愿望的独唱家而外，对民盟四重唱表示同情甚至跟着浅哼低吟的不是还大有人在么？这就是我们国内的情况。至于国外的情况又怎样呢？记得1949年8月5日，美蒋匪帮在我人民解放军快要解放全中国，美国驻华大使司徒雷登在回到华盛顿途中的时候，美帝国务院发表了“中美关系”的白皮书，及美帝国务卿艾奇逊致总统杜鲁门信的全文，两份文件在说明了美帝侵华彻底失败的种种原因之外，在白皮书中提到把希望寄托于中国“民主个人主义者”身上，将鼓励他们以推翻人民民主新中国为目标的一切活动之发展。
    对于敌人这一些期望，想通过“民主个人主义者”来作他的第五纵队，以推翻共产党领导，取消无产阶级专政，从而根本破坏中苏两国牢不可破的友谊，这与我们民盟组织中这一首四重唱的内容、从效果上我看不出来有什么本质上的差异。好在党中央高瞻远瞩，老早看到在中国当时还有“民主个人主义者”一层薄薄的社会基础，应该予以坚决的摧毁，故不惜一而再，再而三而四而五次地在人民日报上对白皮书给以最严厉的批评。而且民盟总部在1949年8月24日也在人民日报上发表了斥责美帝白皮书的文章，还慷慨激昂地认为“对美帝尚存些微幻想的自由主义分子，亦必为这本白皮书所唤醒。真正的‘民主个人主义’者必能自爱爱国，绝不至于出卖祖国，甘为美帝做奴才”。如果章伯钧、罗隆基当时在盟中央同意这篇斥责的发表，究竟二人真实想法怎样？证以他们在整风中的言论，我感到有所怀疑。再看今天台湾、香港美蒋匪帮对章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平的发言，那种弹冠相庆，隔海致敬的欢欣鼓舞情况，谁能说美帝1949年白皮书中那些寄托，一直没有在他们身上体现出来。自然，这一首重唱曲的感染力，虽然在整风运动中假“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的外衣，想偷天换日来改变国体，模糊住了国内少数人于一时，但新中国的大船，在中央毛主席掌握着马列主义的指南针，走社会主义共产主义的道路，经过许多惊涛骇浪，过去、现在及将来都永远不会迷失方向。何况还有千千万万群众在党的领导下同教育下、已经耳聪目明起来，能够分清敌我，明辨是非，不管你外形伪装得怎样漂亮，歌调唱得来何等地迷人，我们有了工人阶级的立场，唯物的观点，辩证的方法，这样全套武装起来的头脑同耳目，我们完全可以把大小鱼妖的原形一步一步地观察出来，很妥善地处理她。现在我们已从他们不同的旋律找出他们共同的和声及所企图表现的主题思想，我们今后想更进一步揭露他们四重唱的指挥是谁？及这样的重唱表演究竟是自发偶合，或是幕后还有大鱼妖在牵线？不管是组织上的或思想上的，我们都希望这几个重唱家好好把它交代清楚，才能很好地把这一层“民主个人主义者”的薄薄基础摧毁，让全国人民受到一次很好的阶级教育，而他们也从与鱼妖千丝万缕联系着的鱼群当中解救出来，彻底改造自己，很好地为人民服务。
