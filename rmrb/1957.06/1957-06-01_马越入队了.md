    Ma Yue Joins the Young Pioneers
    By Our Correspondent Dai Yue
    Do you remember the poster "We Love Peace"? It features a photograph of a boy and a girl, standing side by side, each holding a peace dove, their heads tilted, smiling sweetly, expressing their pure wish to the people of the world: We Love Peace. From cities to villages, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, you could see the smiling faces of these two children everywhere. An officer of the People's Liberation Army wrote to them in very neat regular script: "In my office, dormitory, and pocket, I have your pictures. Whenever I encounter difficulties or feel tired from work, looking at your pictures immediately increases my courage and strength. You have been constantly encouraging my work, study, and progress..." They once received over a thousand such letters.

    This boy is called Ma Yue. Before this year's "June 1st" Children's Day, he joined the Young Pioneers, which is news that many people will be happy to hear. However, since the publication of that poster in 1952, for the past three or four years, Ma Yue has developed a sense of pride and complacency. Neither the kindergarten, his family, nor the school provided him with adequate education, leading him down the wrong path. By the time Beijing Primary School had to suspend him in the summer of 1956, Ma Yue's bad habits had reached their peak.

    On September 1, 1956, Ma Yue transferred from Beijing Primary School to the No. 2 Central Primary School in Dongsi District, Beijing. He was used to a free and undisciplined life at Beijing Primary School, so when he came to this school, he was like a willful pony, doing whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. During the principal's speech before morning exercises, Ma Yue imitated the principal's tone of voice, which echoed across the quiet playground. During exercises, he would wander from one line to another, disrupting others. When classmates urged him to exercise, he said it was too cold. During class, while the teacher was lecturing on the podium, he would perform comic dialogues below. The teacher criticized him severely, but he nonchalantly said, "You should live a few more years, why are you getting so angry?" During breaks, none of the students in his class paid attention to him. Feeling lonely and isolated in his class, he would go to other classes to make trouble. Teachers and students from other classes also criticized him, but these criticisms had no effect on him. The more harshly he was treated, the more he wanted to show off. At this time, teachers and students were all bad people in Ma Yue's eyes, and he often beat and scolded Young Pioneers for no reason. Knowing that Ma Yue was not afraid of harshness, the teachers coaxed him, praised him, and inappropriately commended him. Ma Yue keenly felt that the teachers and students were not sincere to him, which aroused even greater resentment in him.

    These matters attracted the serious attention of the teachers, who jointly studied how to educate Ma Yue well. Once, during class, when the students were all paying attention to the lecture, Ma Yue started singing "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." At this time, the students all looked at him. Teacher Ruan stopped lecturing, walked to his side, and calmly took Ma Yue's hand, sat him down, and said, "Ma Yue, calculate how much time you are wasting for everyone by singing. If we calculate five minutes per person, how much time are you wasting for the whole class of forty people?" Ma Yue blinked his eyes and said, "Two hundred minutes." The teacher said, "Because you alone are wasting so much time for others, do you think that's right?" Ma Yue lowered his head and said, "Teacher, I'm wrong, I won't sing anymore." From then on, Ma Yue rarely shouted loudly in class. The teacher discovered that he was relatively interested in arithmetic and listened carefully, but he had not brought his notebook, pencil, or knife. The teacher asked him, "Why don't you calculate it out?" He said, "I calculated it in my head." The teacher said, "Would it be okay if I taught you using only my head, without speaking or writing?" Ma Yue scratched his head and said, "I'll bring them next time."

    In order to increase his confidence in learning, the teacher and classmates urged him to keep a diary every day, recording what good things he had done, what bad things he had done, which classes he had listened to, and which classes he had not. Ma Yue also truthfully recorded it. His diary showed that he listened to arithmetic class the most, and his arithmetic test scores were all four or five points, while other grades were not good. The teacher helped him analyze the reasons, and Ma Yue also knew that learning had good results, and not learning was bad. However, he felt that it was too difficult to study every subject, so he said to the teacher, "Wouldn't it be great if we studied less and played more?" The teacher then told him stories about how children develop their character, needing to be strong and brave, and also good at controlling themselves, and resolutely not doing things that are not good for themselves or the collective. After listening to the stories, Ma Yue said, "I will study hard in the future."

    One day, during a homework session, Ma Yue saw the students running out to kick a small leather ball. He threw his pen and notebook on the desk and ran out. Teacher Ruan said sternly, "Ma Yue, what are you doing?" Ma Yue immediately stopped, bit his lip, and said, "Oh, it's too difficult." Teacher Ruan was originally going to lunch after class, but didn't go. She walked to Ma Yue's side and asked him, "Which part is difficult, I'll help you." Teacher Ruan stayed with him until he finished his homework and walked out of the classroom together. From then on, Ma Yue felt that Teacher Ruan was very kind and was very willing to listen to Teacher Ruan's words. Now, when Ma Yue is not paying attention in class, as long as Teacher Ruan reminds him, he immediately corrects himself. Teacher Ruan spends most of her spare time tutoring Ma Yue, and now he can keep up with everyone's learning, and Ma Yue no longer feels that learning is too difficult.

    In the past, Ma Yue never brought all his things to school. He would either forget his book or forget his notebook, or bring a knife but forget his pencil. When he needed something in class, he would ask his classmates, affecting their learning. To help him, a little girl saw that all his pencils were blunt. She secretly took his pencils, sharpened them, and put them in his desk. When Ma Yue opened his desk during class and saw this situation, he was both surprised and delighted. Who helped him sharpen them? Later, he learned that it was a Young Pioneer.

    One day, for a Young Pioneer activity, the members decided to go to Beihai Park. They invited Ma Yue to participate. Ma Yue was very happy and took the initiative to guide everyone, because Ma Yue grew up in the Beihai Kindergarten, and he was familiar with every place there. Ma Yue led the members through the places where the kindergarten teachers used to take him to play. In the park, Ma Yue saw a group of children led by teachers, which immediately reminded him of his time at the Beihai Kindergarten, when he was like the other children, and no one regarded him as a bad child. But today, although he was playing with the members, he was different from them. They were all wearing red scarves, but he didn't have one. How much he wanted to wear a red scarf like them! He also thought that he still had many shortcomings. On the way home, he was silent. From then on, he rarely spoke, and the teacher and classmates rarely saw him making trouble.

    Ma Yue not only received help from all the teachers and students in the school, but also from people in society who cared about him and helped him. Deng Fuzhong, a police officer from the Che'nian'dian Police Station in Dongsi District (the police station in Ma Yue's street), was Ma Yue's good friend three years ago. At that time, Ma Yue liked him very much and often went to the police station to play with him. On January 15, 1957, Deng Fuzhong had just returned from working outside when he saw an article titled "The Ups and Downs of Ma Yue's Growth" published in the Beijing Youth Daily. He felt as if he was being blamed. From then on, he often went to Ma Yue's home to help Ma Yue, talk to him, care about his life outside of school, and contacted the Dongsi District "Children's Home" to ask Ma Yue to participate in the Children's Home's group activities. To help Ma Yue, Ma Yue's father also participated in activities with Ma Yue at the Children's Home during vacations.

    Ma Yue's father also established close contact with the school. He took time out to attend school parent-teacher conferences even when his studies were very busy, and often wrote letters to the school to learn about Ma Yue's situation at school, and took the initiative to cooperate with the school to educate Ma Yue.

    Under the care and help of all parties, Ma Yue improved day by day. At six o'clock in the morning on May 20, the school was particularly quiet, with only Teacher Ruan in the office reading a book. Teacher Ruan suddenly heard light footsteps outside the window and saw Ma Yue walking back and forth outside the door, as if he had something to say. Ma Yue knocked lightly on the door a few times, walked in, stood in front of the teacher very seriously, handed the application to join the Young Pioneers to Teacher Ruan, and said, "I want to join the Young Pioneers, but I still have many shortcomings. I hope the teacher will help me correct them. I applied to join the Young Pioneers six times when I was at Beijing Primary School. Each time, the teacher said to test me. This is the seventh time I'm applying." Teacher Ruan encouraged him to continue to work hard. Teacher Ruan quickly handed the application to the team for discussion. The members unanimously agreed to Ma Yue joining the team and formally approved Ma Yue's joining the team on May 22. All the teachers in the school also discussed the issue of Ma Yue's joining the team and pointed out that Ma Yue still had some shortcomings and that education should continue to be strengthened after he joined the team.

    On May 31, on the eve of "June 1st," it was the day Ma Yue wore the red scarf. He smiled happily, as innocent, lively, and lovely as in the "We Love Peace" poster.

    马越入队了
    本报记者　戴月
    你还记得“我们热爱和平”那张招贴画吗？这是一个男孩子和一个女孩子的照片，他俩并排站着，每人抱着一只和平鸽，歪着脸儿微笑着，向全世界人民表达出他们纯洁的心愿——我们热爱和平。从城市到农村，从黑龙江到海南岛，到处都可以看到这两个孩子的笑脸。一位解放军的军官，用非常工整的楷体字，这样写信给他们：“在我的办公室、宿舍和衣袋里，都有你们的像。每当我遇到困难或者工作疲劳的时候，看看你们的像，马上就增加了勇气和力量。你们一直就在鼓舞着我的工作、学习和进步……”他俩曾经收到过上千封这样的信。
    这个男孩子就叫马越，今年“六一”儿童节的前夕加入少年先锋队，这是很多人听了都要高兴的消息。可是自从1952年那张招贴画出版以后，这三、四年来，马越却滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，不论是幼儿园、家庭、学校都没有很好地对他进行教育，使他一直向着岔道走去。直到1956年暑假，北京小学不得不叫他停学的时候，马越的坏习惯简直发展到了顶点。
    马越在1956年9月1日从北京小学转到北京市东四区二中心小学。他在北京小学过惯了自由散漫的生活，到这个学校，他就像一匹任性的小马，不管在什么时候，他想干什么就干什么。在早操前校长讲话的时候，肃静的操场上传出了马越学着校长讲话的口音。作操的时候，他从这个队串到那个队，搅乱别人，同学们叫他作操时，他说天太冷了。上课时老师在台上讲课，他在下边说相声。教师对他进行了严厉的批评，可是他却满不在乎地说：“你多活几年吧，干吗生这么大气呀？”休息时全班同学谁也不理他，他在本班感到孤独寂寞，就跑到别的班上去闹，别班的老师和同学也批评他，但这些批评对他不起作用。越是对他粗暴，他越要逞强。这时，教师、同学在马越的眼里都是坏人，他经常无故打骂少先队员。教师知道马越不怕硬，便哄着他，夸奖他，不适当地表扬他。马越很敏锐地感到：教师、同学对他不诚恳，引起他更大的反感。
    这些事情引起了教师们的严重注意，就共同研究，怎样把马越教育好。有一次课堂上同学们都注意听讲，马越唱起了“解放军进行曲”。这时，同学们都看着他，阮老师停止讲课，走到他的身边，心平气和地拉着马越的手坐下来说：“马越，你算算，你唱歌，耽误大家听课。如果一个人按五分钟计算，全班四十个人耽误了多少时间。”马越眨巴眨巴眼睛说：“二百分钟。”老师说，“因为你一个人耽误别人这么多时间，你说对不对？”马越低下头说：“老师，我不对，以后不唱了。”从此马越在课堂上很少大喊大叫了。老师发现他对算术比较感兴趣，很注意听讲，可是本子、铅笔、小刀什么也没带来。老师问他：“你为什么不算出来？”他说：“我脑袋算了。”老师说：“我不用嘴说不用手写，用脑袋教你们行不行？”马越挠挠头说：“我下次带来。”
    为了提高他的学习信心，老师和同学督促他每天记日记，每天作了哪些好事，哪些坏事，哪门课听了，哪门课没有听，马越也实事求是地记下来。他的日记里记着算术课听得最多，他的算术考试成绩都是四分、五分，其他成绩不好。老师帮助他分析原因，马越也知道学习了效果好，不学习就不好，可是他觉得每门课都学习太难，就向老师说：“咱们少念书，多玩会该多好啊。”老师就给他讲少年儿童锻炼性格的故事，既要坚强、勇敢，又要善于控制自己，对个人对集体没有好处的事情就坚决不作。马越听了故事说：“以后要好好学习。”
    有一天，正上作业课，马越看见同学们都跑出去踢小皮球，他把笔和本子往桌子上一扔就跑。阮老师严肃地说：“马越，你做什么？”马越立刻站住咬咬嘴唇说：“唉哟，太难了。”阮老师本来下课后就去吃午饭，但是没去，走在马越身边问他：“哪个地方难，我来帮助你。”阮老师一直陪他作完功课，一块走出教室。从此马越感到阮老师非常可亲，很愿意听阮老师的话。现在马越上课时稍不注意听课，只要阮老师一提醒，他立刻纠正。阮老师把大部分业余时间用来给马越补课，现在他能跟上大家的学习，马越再不感到学习太难了。
    马越过去上学从来没把东西带齐，不是忘带书就是忘带本子，带来小刀忘掉铅笔，上课时要用就向同学们要，影响别人学习。为了帮助他，一个小女孩看到他几支铅笔都是秃秃的，她便偷偷地把他的铅笔拿出来，削得尖尖的，放在他书桌里。上课的时候，马越打开书桌看到这种情形，又惊又喜。到底是谁帮他削的？后来他知道是少先队员。
    有一天过小队日，队员决定到北海去，他们请马越参加，马越很高兴，还主动给大家作响导，因为马越从小就是在北海幼儿园长大的，那里的每个地方他都熟悉。马越领着队员走过了他在幼儿园时阿姨领他玩过的地方。在公园里马越看到一群由阿姨领着的小朋友，立刻引起了他在北海幼儿园时的回忆，那时自己和小朋友们一样，谁也没把我当作坏孩子看待。可是今天虽然和队员们一块玩，却和他们不一样，人家都带着红领巾，自己却没有，心里是多么想和他们一样带上红领巾呀！他又想自己身上还有很多缺点。在回家的路上，他沉默着，从此他很少说话，老师和同学很少看到他打闹。
    马越不仅得到全校老师和同学们的帮助，而且社会人士也在关心他，帮助他。东四区车辇店派出所（马越住的本街派出所）民警邓福忠三年前是马越的好朋友，那时马越很喜欢他，常到派出所去找他玩。1957年1月15日邓福忠刚从外边工作回来，看到北京青年报发表题为“马越成长中的风波”一文，他心里好像受到了责备，从此他常到马越家去帮助马越，和他谈心，关心他的校外生活，并和东四区“少年之家”联系，叫马越参加少年之家的小组活动。马越的爸爸为了帮助马越，在放假时也到少年之家和马越一块参加活动。
    马越的爸爸并和学校取得了密切的联系，学校开家长会议，他在学习非常紧张的情况下也抽出时间去参加，还经常给学校写信了解马越在校的情况，主动和学校配合对马越进行教育。
    在各方面的关怀和帮助下，马越一天天变好了。5月20日早上六点多钟，学校里特别清静，只有阮老师一人在办公室里看书。阮老师突然听到窗外有轻轻的脚步声，看到马越在门外走来走去，好像有事情。马越轻轻敲了几下门，走了进来，很严肃地站在老师面前，把入队申请书交给了阮老师，说：“我要入队，但是还有很多缺点，希望老师帮助我改正，在北京小学时曾经六次申请入队，每次老师都说考验考验我，这是第七次申请。”阮老师鼓励他继续努力。阮老师很快把申请书交给中队讨论，队员们一致同意马越入队，并在5月22日正式批准马越入队。全校教师也讨论了马越的入队问题，并指出马越还有一些缺点，入队后要继续加强对他进行教育。
    5月31日，“六一”前夕，是马越带红领巾的日子。他快乐地微笑着，像“我们热爱和平”招贴画上那样天真、活泼、可爱。
