The CCP Central Women's Work Committee and the All-China Women's Federation Party Group, on June 3rd, continued to invite non-Party members of the All-China Women's Federation Standing Committee and Executive Committee, heads of women's work in various democratic parties, and heads of member organizations for discussions.

At the meeting, Cai Chang, First Secretary of the CCP Central Women's Work Committee, addressed the specific issues raised by everyone at the last discussion, saying: In accordance with the rectification principles of rectifying, correcting, and doing simultaneously, the issues raised that can be resolved will be studied and resolved as soon as possible; those that cannot be resolved for the time being will continue to be studied and resolved; and those involving other units will be forwarded to them for study and resolution. She said that, according to everyone's opinions, the CCP Central Women's Committee and the democratic parties can establish fixed contact, once a quarter or once every two months, and temporary contact can also be made if problems arise temporarily. As for the contact methods,座谈会、individual talks, and other methods can be adopted. The contact between the All-China Women's Federation and the three member organizations should also be strengthened.

Those who spoke at yesterday's meeting included Xu Guangping and Li Dequan, Vice-Chairpersons of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation; Xie Xuehong, Chairperson of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; and Shi Ruzhang, Director of the Ministry of Work and Student Ministry of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China.

Xu Guangping said: We want socialist law, not capitalist law
In her speech, Xu Guangping mentioned the problem that the All-China Women's Federation had not played a good role in collective leadership. She also suggested that after the Third National Women's Congress, the leadership should be strengthened or several more vice-chairpersons should be added.

Xu Guangping also said, "I agree with what some comrades have said, that the work of the All-China Women's Federation should focus on policies and ideology. Did we focus on it in the past? I think we did and we didn't. When problems arise, they are pushed back and forth, delayed, waited for, and asked about, often delaying the decision until the time has passed. Some things have to be abandoned simply because too much time has passed; in addition, some things that the All-China Women's Federation should be in charge of, such as contraception, divorce, bigamy, children dropping out of school, theft, rape, etc., have not been handled well. Sitting in the office, holding a few meetings, and issuing some propaganda materials cannot completely solve the problems." Xu Guangping also believes that the Central Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation should mobilize all forces to completely eliminate the existing feudal remnants, so that women and men can truly achieve de facto equality.

Xu Guangping concluded by saying that some people are currently saying: "The Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries Movements were the Communist Party rectifying us, and now we are rectifying the Communist Party. Therefore, as long as we raise negative opinions and do not raise positive opinions." Some people said that the speeches made by Zhou Jianren and Li Yi at the symposium of heads of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures convened by the United Front Work Department had too many positive opinions and were too right-leaning. "I don't think that's right. The Communist Party's rectification is to improve its work, and improving its work is beneficial to the people of the whole country, not a matter of who is retaliating against whom." Some people say: "We should strengthen the legal system." I think it is right to strengthen the legal system, but we cannot say that we have no law. What we want is socialist law, not capitalist law. Some people do not recognize socialist law and want capitalist law, so they talk a lot about law. She believes that only mentioning the bad and not the good will only expand the "walls and trenches." If non-Party members can truly follow the Party, there will be no "walls and trenches," otherwise there will be. Some people also advocate abolishing the Party committee system in schools. I think it is unimaginable without the selfless leadership of the Communist Party. Xu Guangping believes that the attitude towards the Party's rectification should be objective, and there should be no "forgiveness" or "hostility," but rather to express one's views as objectively, appropriately, and without emotional bias as possible, while trying to look at the problem more comprehensively.

Li Dequan suggests strengthening women's ideological education
In her speech, Li Dequan first affirmed the achievements of women's work. She said that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee's Women's Work Committee and the All-China Women's Federation Party Group, women in New China have made great progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects. In order to strengthen women's work, she hopes that the Third National Women's Congress will consider adding a few more vice-chairpersons.

Li Dequan then talked about the All-China Women's Federation should conduct ideological education for women, educate young girls to correctly handle their marriage and love issues, educate women to pay attention to hygiene, educate their children well, and educate women in work and study positions to realize that knowledge is power and to resolutely advance towards science.

Xie Xuehong said in her speech that she does not do women's work, but she would like to reflect some of the opinions she has heard. These opinions are: hoping that the Party Central Committee Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation can seriously care about women's vital issues. Currently, there are more problems in implementing the Marriage Law at the grassroots level. The Party Central Committee Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation should make specific measures to continue implementing the Marriage Law. For example, women in work and study positions cannot find good nannies to take care of their children. It is hoped that the All-China Women's Federation can assist organs at all levels in strengthening the education of nannies.

In addition, it is hoped that the Party Central Committee Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation will pay more attention to the women of Taiwanese living on the mainland and returned overseas Chinese. It is hoped that the "Chinese Women" magazine will report more on the situation of Taiwanese women.

Shi Ruzhang spoke last. She said that the work of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China is very complicated, and the content is also diverse, involving religion, women, youth, and other aspects. In the past, the All-China Women's Federation's contact with us was not timely enough and not frequent enough. It is hoped that the All-China Women's Federation can give us comprehensive help in the future and ask the local All-China Women's Federations to understand our work and help us solve difficulties in our work.

The symposium will continue.

    中共中央妇委和全国妇联党组
    邀党外妇女工作者继续座谈
    蔡畅表示中央妇委将和各民主党派建立固定联系
    本报讯　中共中央妇女工作委员会和中华全国民主妇联党组，6月3日继续邀请全国妇联党外的常委、执委，各民主党派妇女工作的负责人，及团体会员的负责人座谈。
    会上，中共中央妇女工作委员会第一书记蔡畅对上次座谈时大家提出来的具体问题作了交代，她说：根据边整、边改、边做的整风方针，大家提出来的可以解决的问题将及早研究解决；一时不能解决的将继续研究解决；涉及到其他单位的将转去请他们研究解决。她说，根据大家的意见，中共中央妇委和各民主党派可以建立固定的联系，一季一次，两个月一次都可以，临时发生了问题还可临时联系。至于联系方式，可以采取开座谈会、个别交谈等方法。全国妇联和三个会员团体的联系也应该加强。
    昨天在会上发言的有中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平、李德全，台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红，中华基督教女青年会全国协会事工部兼学生部主任干事施如璋。
    许广平说：我们要社会主义的法，不要资本主义的法
    许广平在发言中提到妇联没有很好地发挥集体领导作用的问题。她还建议在第三次妇代大会以后，加强领导或者增加几个副主席。
    许广平还说，我同意一些同志所说的，妇联工作应该抓政策思想，过去抓不抓呢？我觉得也抓也不抓。遇到问题时推来推去，拖来拖去，等来等去，问来问去，往往耽搁到时间过了才做出决定，有些事不得不因时间过久，索性拉倒；另外有些妇联应该管的一些事情，如避孕、离婚、重婚、儿童失学、偷盗、强奸等等问题，没有抓得很好，坐在办公室里，开几个会，发些宣传品，不能完全解决问题。许广平还认为中央妇委、全国妇联应该动员各方面的力量，彻底消除目前存在的封建残余思想，使妇女和男子真正做到事实上的平等。
    许广平最后说，目前有人说：三反、五反、肃反是共产党整我们，现在我们整共产党，因此，只要提反面意见，不提正面意见，有人说：周建人和李毅在统战部召开的各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士座谈会上的发言正面意见多了，是过右了。我看不对，共产党整风，是为了搞好工作，搞好工作，对全国人民有好处，不是谁报复谁的问题。有人说：要加强法制，我认为加强法制是对的，但是不能说我们没有法，我们要的是社会主义的法，不是资本主义的法，有人不承认社会主义的法，要资本主义的法，所以才大谈其法。他认为：只提坏的，不提好的，反而扩大了“墙、沟”。非党人士要是能真正跟党走，就没有“墙、沟”，否则就有。还有人主张取消学校里的党委制，我认为没有大公无私的共产党的领导，是不堪设想的。许广平认为：对待党的整风，应该是客观的，不应该存在“宽恕”与“敌对”，而是尽可能地、恰如其分地、不含意气地说出自己的看法，而又尽量做到较全面地看问题。
    李德全建议加强妇女思想教育
    李德全在发言中，首先肯定了妇女工作的成绩，她说，在党中央妇委和全国妇联党组领导下，新中国的妇女在政治、经济、文化方面已经得到很大发展，为了加强妇女工作，她希望第三次妇代会上，能考虑多增加几位副主席。
    李德全接着谈到妇联应对妇女进行思想教育，教育年青姑娘正确处理自己的婚姻、恋爱问题，教育妇女注意卫生、教育好自己的孩子，教育工作、学习岗位上的妇女认识到知识就是力量，切实向科学进军。
    谢雪红在发言中说，她不做妇女工作，但是，她反映一下听到的意见，这些意见是：希望党中央妇委和全国妇联能认真关心妇女的切身问题，目前下面贯彻婚姻法问题较多，党中央妇委和全国妇联应该作出继续贯彻婚姻法的具体措施，再如，工作、学习岗位上的妇女找不到好的保姆带孩子，希望妇联能协助各级机关加强对保姆的教育。
    另外，还希望党中央妇委和全国妇联多多关心家住台湾人在大陆及归国华侨的妇女，希望中国妇女杂志多报道一些台湾妇女的情况。
    施如璋最后发言，她说，中华基督教女青年会全国协会的工作很复杂，内容也多，涉及到宗教、妇女、青年等等方面，全国妇联过去和我们的联系不够及时，不够经常，希望今后妇联能够全面地给我们帮助，并要求各地市妇联能了解我们的工作，帮助我们解决工作中的困难。
    座谈会将继续举行。
