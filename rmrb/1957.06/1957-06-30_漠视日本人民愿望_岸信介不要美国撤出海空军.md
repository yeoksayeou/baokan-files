　　Disregarding the Wishes of the Japanese People
    Nobusuke Kishi Does Not Want the US to Withdraw its Naval and Air Forces
    Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, Honolulu dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said at a press conference held in Honolulu yesterday that Japan "does not want to request the United States Air Force and Navy to withdraw (from Japan)."
    The Japanese people have been strongly demanding that the United States withdraw all its troops stationed in Japan. In order to ease the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people and promote its "atomic strategy," the United States has recently decided to withdraw its ground combat troops from Japan.
    Nobusuke Kishi, who arrived in Hawaii on the 27th from Los Angeles after visiting the United States, also said that his government would begin to expand the US Air Force base at Tachikawa in Tokyo, and if it is "absolutely necessary," his government would also expand other air force bases.
    Currently, the people of Sunagawa-cho in Japan are fighting against the forced measurement of their land for the expansion of the Tachikawa Air Force Base.
    Ignoring the wishes of the Okinawan people against turning Okinawa Island into a military base, Nobusuke Kishi said that he himself does not object to the United States establishing military bases on Okinawa Island, nor does he want to abolish the US bases.
    The Japanese "Akahata" recently pointed out that after Kishi Nobusuke held talks with US leaders in Washington, he is implementing a policy of cooperating with the US "atomic strategy."

　　漠视日本人民愿望
    岸信介不要美国撤出海空军
    新华社29日讯　檀香山消息：日本首相岸信介昨天在檀香山举行的记者招待会上说，日本“不想要求美国空军和海军（从日本）撤出”。
    日本人民一直强烈要求美国把驻在日本的全部军队撤走。美国为了缓和日本人民的反美情绪和推行“原子战略”，最近已经决定要把地面战斗部队撤出日本。
    在访问美国以后27日从洛杉矶到达夏威夷的岸信介还说，他的政府要着手扩大美国在东京的立川空军基地，如果“绝对必要的话”，他的政府还要扩大其他空军基地。
    目前，日本砂川町的人民正在进行斗争，反对为扩大立川空军基地而强行测量他们的土地。
    岸信介不顾冲绳人民反对把冲绳岛军事基地化的愿望，说他自己并不反对美国在冲绳岛建立军事基地，也不想废除美国的基地。
    日本“赤旗报”最近指出，岸信介在华盛顿同美国首脑会谈以后，正在实行同美国的“原子战略”合作的政策。
