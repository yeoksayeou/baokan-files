    Someone asked me what kind of opera I like to watch? I said: I like to watch any kind of opera, as long as it is "satisfying, funny, complete with a beginning and an end, and lively with both speaking and fighting." Many of the programs of the quyi troupes and folk professional troupes are like this, and our workers welcome them. These troupes are small and particularly flexible, making it very convenient to perform small-scale performances in factories. I hope the cultural departments will pay attention to supporting them, so that they can give full play to their role.

    爱看什么戏
    有人问我爱看什么戏？我说：什么戏都爱看，只要是“解气的，逗笑的，有头有尾成套的，连说带打热闹的”就行。曲艺剧团和民间职业剧团，就有很多这样的节目，我们工人都欢迎，这些剧团小，特别灵活，下厂作小型演出很方便。希望文化部门重视扶持它们，让它们充分发挥作用吧。
