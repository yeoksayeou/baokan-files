　　Rockets and Satellites Fly Together to Explore the Mysteries of the Universe
　　The Soviet Union Vigorously Develops Geophysics
    Moscow dispatch from our newspaper on the 19th: The Soviet Union will actively participate in the work of the International Geophysical Year and will launch artificial satellites. Academician Bardin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Soviet Committee for Participation in the International Geophysical Year, Professor Davitaya, Vice Chairman, and Corresponding Academician Fedorov, head of the working group for studying the upper atmosphere with rockets and artificial satellites, held a press conference on this matter on the 18th.
    Academician Bardin said: In this International Geophysical Year, sixty countries will participate in the study of the Earth and two thousand scientific stations will be established, of which five hundred will be organized by the Soviet Union. Undoubtedly, the work of the Geophysical Year will lead to great discoveries and will further develop the science of the Earth.
    Professor Fedorov spoke about the significance of studying the upper atmosphere. He said: The upper atmosphere contains a small amount of matter, only 1% to 2% of the air, but it plays a significant role in life. The upper atmosphere is the first to encounter solar radiation energy and cosmic particles. The reactions that occur in the upper layer result in solar radiation energy and cosmic particles becoming harmless when they reach the ground. The reactions that occur in the upper layer also play an important role in life, such as the formation of the ionosphere, which allows us to communicate with distant places by radio. Of interest to astrophysicists and astronomers is: what is the nature of various radiations; since the atmosphere affects radiation, what is the situation of radiation outside the atmosphere. Before entering outer space, it is necessary to master this environment first. For a long time, research has been limited to passive observation. In the last ten years, scientists have used rockets for observation. The Soviet Union began using rockets from 1949 to 1950. Since then, a large number of rockets have been launched. The results of the research show that no significant changes in the chemical composition of the air have been found at an altitude of 100 kilometers. Unlike the United States, Soviet scientists not only use rockets, but also use containers that will jump out of the rockets when necessary. This avoids rocket failures. Soviet scientists will launch more than one hundred rockets in various places during the Geophysical Year, shooting into the air from forty kilometers to two hundred kilometers.
    Professor Fedorov continued: Rockets alone are not enough, because they can only observe from one point. The Soviet Union will launch satellites with instruments. The satellite will pass over the Earth in a spiral pattern. It will fly to a height of two to three hundred kilometers. In order to avoid falling down, the satellite must travel along its orbit at a speed of 29,000 kilometers per hour. This speed is given by the rocket launching the satellite in the final stage. The satellite revolves around the Earth in one and a half hours. The satellite is equipped with instruments that can measure air density and meteorology, solar radiation, cosmic radiation and the intensity of ultraviolet rays, etc. One satellite cannot hold all the instruments. It seems that each instrument should be installed in a separate satellite. This is the beginning of the development of interstellar communication. The technology of launching satellites is very complicated, and we cannot announce the day of the launch. In the United States, great importance is attached to who launches the first satellite. We do not regard launching satellites as creating any records. The important thing is to properly install the satellite. The United States has launched satellites once or twice, but the satellites have not reached orbit.
    Researcher Pokrovsky talked about the results of launching three dogs into rockets. One dog was shot to a height of 110 kilometers, and the other two dogs were shot to heights of 105 and 101 kilometers twice. At first, the dogs were placed in sealed cabins, and their physiological conditions were normal. Later, the dogs were placed in diving suits and ejected when the rocket descended to an altitude of eighty to ninety kilometers, and they did not die due to lack of oxygen or other effects. At the press conference, the three "passengers" who traveled in rockets at high altitude were always present, jumping around and very lively.
    Pokrovsky said: This Geophysical Year will accelerate the solution to the problem of people flying to interstellar space.
    Professor Kort said: Soviet oceanographers will set off on twelve exploration ships, including large ships such as the "Ob" and "Ocean," as well as the world's only non-magnetic ship, the "Zarya." This ship is made of materials such as wood, brass, bronze, and non-magnetic steel, and is specially designed for studying magnetic field zones. It will take about a year and a half to travel 45,000 miles in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.

### 火箭与卫星齐飞  探索宇宙的奥秘  苏联大力发展地球物理学

　　火箭与卫星齐飞  探索宇宙的奥秘
　　苏联大力发展地球物理学
    本报莫斯科19日电　苏联将积极参加国际地球物理年的工作，并将放射人造卫星。苏联科学院副院长、苏联参加国际地球物理年工作的委员会主席巴尔丁院士，副主席达维塔加教授，以火箭和人造卫星研究大气上层的工作组组长费多罗夫通讯院士等人，18日就这件事举行了记者招待会。
    巴尔丁院士说：在这次国际地球物理年中，将有六十个国家参加地球的研究工作，并将建立二千个科学站，其中五百个科学站将由苏联组织。无疑的，地球物理年的工作将导致巨大的发现，将进一步发展地球的科学。
    费多罗夫教授谈了研究大气上层的意义。他说：大气上层所含物质不多，只有1％到2％的空气，可是对生命作用很大。大气上层首先遇到太阳的辐射能和宇宙微粒。在上层发生的反应，结果使太阳辐射能和宇宙微粒来到地面时变成无害的。在上层发生的反应，对生活也有重要作用，例如形成电离层，使我们能够用无线电与远方联系。对于天文物理学家和天文学家有兴趣的是：各种辐射的本性如何；既然大气影响辐射，那么在大气层外的辐射情形怎样。在进入宇宙空间以前，先要掌握这个环境。长久以来，研究工作仅限于被动地观察。晚近十年，科学家才利用火箭观察。苏联从1949年到1950年开始使用火箭。自此发射了大量火箭。研究的结果，在一百公里的空中没有发现空气的化学成分有什么重要变化。苏联科学家与美国不同，不但使用火箭，还使用盛器，它们在必要时会从火箭内跳出。这可以避免火箭的故障。苏联科学家在地球物理年中将在各处发射一百多个火箭，射向四十公里到二百公里空中。
    费多罗夫教授接着说：光靠火箭是不够的，因为只能从一点观察。苏联将放射带有仪器的卫星。卫星按螺旋状穿过地球上空。它将飞到二、三百公里的高空。为了保持不跌下来，卫星要以一小时二万九千公里的速度沿着轨道运行。这个速度是放射卫星的火箭在最后阶段给予的。卫星在一个半小时内绕地球一转。在卫星上装有仪器，它们能够测量空气的密度和气象、太阳辐射、宇宙辐射和紫外线的强度等等。一个卫星装不下所有的仪器。看来，各个仪器要装在各个卫星里。这是发展星际往来的初步。放射卫星技术很复杂，我们不能宣布在那一天放射。在美国很重视谁第一个放射卫星。我们不把放射卫星看作创造什么纪录。重要的是把卫星装置好。在美国放射过一两次卫星，但卫星没有达到轨道上。
    研究员波克罗夫斯基谈了把三只狗装在火箭内发射的结果。有一只狗被射到一百一十公里的空中，另外二只狗两次被射到一百零五和一百零一公里的空中。起初把狗放在密封的舱内，生理情况正常。后来把狗放在潜水衣具内，当火箭下降到空中八九十公里高处时把它抛出，也没有因为缺乏氧气或其他影响而死亡。在举行记者招待会时，那三位乘火箭在高空旅行的“乘客”始终在场，跳来跳去，非常活泼。
    波克罗夫斯基说：这次地球物理年将加速解决人飞到星际的问题。
    科尔特教授说：苏联海洋学者将乘十二艘探险轮船出发研究，其中有“鄂毕号”、“海洋号”等大船，还有世界唯一的非磁性的轮船“黎明号”。这艘船是用木材、黄铜、青铜、非磁性钢等材料制成的，专供研究磁场地带用。它将以约一年半的时间在大西洋、太平洋和印度洋作四万五千哩的航行。
