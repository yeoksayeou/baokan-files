　　The United States' Disarmament Gourd Contains What Medicine?
　　Hu Ping
　　At the disarmament negotiating table in London, the US negotiating representative recently displayed a hesitant attitude, reminiscent of two ancient poems: "After a thousand calls, she finally emerges, still holding a pipa, half-veiled." As early as a month ago, the United States heavily publicized its "new plan," but after the Disarmament Subcommittee reconvened on June 14, Stassen observed for a full week without mentioning this plan; starting on the 20th, he began to "make suggestions," but like squeezing toothpaste, only a little at a time. Ten days have passed, and the United States has not yet produced the final plan. Even on the issue of nuclear testing – which the Americans once admitted was closest to an agreement – Stassen said at the recent disarmament conference that the US "suggestions" would have to wait.
　　Why is the US negotiating representative so hesitant and mysterious? It seems there are unspeakable reasons: first, he is under orders to delay and avoid an agreement as much as possible; second, the United States does not have a truly viable disarmament plan, so it can only proceed piecemeal, using a drop-by-drop, irrelevant so-called "new suggestion" to alleviate world public opinion's aversion to it and gain the diplomatic initiative.
　　The US negotiating representative once tried to make people believe that the United States was sincerely prepared to reach some agreements this time, starting with the cessation of nuclear testing. But as he was forced to gradually reveal his cards, people saw the imprint of the old US tactics of delaying and obstructing disarmament. The US representative emphasized that the cessation of nuclear weapons testing must be conditional on the signing of an agreement to cease the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons; in terms of reducing conventional armaments, the United States advocated a phased approach, with the second and third phases of disarmament depending on "progress in resolving political issues (such as the reunification of Germany)." Conditions were put forward.
　　In Washington, the tone has changed noticeably. At a press conference on June 19, US President Eisenhower still exuded "optimism," expressing "great pleasure in being able to make some satisfactory arrangements for a temporary cessation of (nuclear weapons) testing." However, a week later, he added complex conditions to this point: the cessation of testing must be linked to "ending the production of fissile materials for weapons, limited aerial inspections, general arms reduction, and a comprehensive general inspection system," etc. Even United Press reporter Saxton admitted that Eisenhower's remarks "indicated that he had retreated from his previous stance." Not only that, Eisenhower also cited the opinions of some hired scientists, trying to show that nuclear testing has almost become completely harmless, and even – according to him – for the development of atomic science for peaceful uses, "these tests must continue."
　　Why are the US disarmament negotiators creating such obstacles, and why is the US President making such contradictory remarks? American newspapers revealed some inside information. "Newsweek" reported on June 24 that within the US government, there is a powerful group that firmly opposes any agreement on disarmament. They insist on continuing the atomic arms race because "US defense is based on atomic weapons." The reason the US negotiating representative proposed ceasing the production of fissile materials as a condition for ceasing testing is because they believe the United States has already stockpiled enough fissile materials to "gain the upper hand"; moreover, as some US newspaper commentators pointed out, they insist on demanding something "that may not be obtainable" in order to effectively prevent an agreement from being reached.
　　However, within the US government and Congress, there are also some people who, in view of the strong pressure of public opinion demanding disarmament, want to act more cleverly. They want to go with the flow and use some innocuous "preliminary agreements" to deceive public opinion and gain some political capital for themselves. The method they came up with is to divide the reduction of conventional armaments into phases, only talking about the first phase of disarmament now, and using "political issues" to obstruct the next phase of disarmament. According to the numbers put forward by the United States for the first phase of reductions, this is in fact equivalent to no reduction. In terms of stopping nuclear weapons testing, they proposed suspending testing for ten months. According to the US "Daily News": this proposal "is of little risk because the United States probably needs ten months to plan its next batch of tests." These are the medicines in the US negotiating representative's gourd. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union took the lead in proposing specific suggestions for stopping nuclear testing, disrupting their steps. This has made Washington scramble.
　　The fundamental problem is that the authorities in Washington are worried that an agreement on disarmament would have adverse political and economic effects on US monopoly capital. After the London conference reconvened in a relatively optimistic atmosphere, the stock prices of industries related to arms production on the US stock market fell one after another. This made the US authorities feel the need to do something quickly to stabilize the market. It was at this time that Eisenhower came out to revise his previous remarks. Vice President Nixon said it even more bluntly, saying: "In these (disarmament) negotiations, our basic purpose and motivation must never be to alleviate our arms burden."
　　In response to the US government's approach to disarmament, the United States has stepped up its provocative actions in the Far East, including publicly announcing the abandonment of the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement concerning the prohibition of bringing reinforcing weapons into Korea. Associated Press reporter Hightower bluntly admitted that the US decision to violate the Korean Armistice Agreement "has a clear and natural relationship to the disarmament talks" because it is conducive to creating the excuse that agreements signed with communist countries "will not be truly effective," and therefore "no more such dangerous things can be done on disarmament issues."
　　All these facts prove that the United States is very afraid of the easing of the international situation. Although it has been forced by the pressure of domestic and international public opinion on the issue of disarmament to make certain gestures, in reality it is still trying to struggle.

### 美国裁军葫芦里的药

　　美国裁军葫芦里的药
　　胡平
    在伦敦的裁军谈判桌上，美国谈判代表最近表现了一种遮遮掩掩的姿态，使人想到两句古诗：“千呼万唤始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮脸”。早在一个月前，美国就大肆宣传它的“新方案”，但6月14日裁军小组委员会复会之后，史塔生观望了整整一星期不谈及这个方案；20日起开始“提建议”了，但是却像挤牙膏一样，一次挤一点。十天又过去了，美国还没有拿出最后的方案来。甚至于关于核试验的问题——这曾经是美国人承认最接近协议的；可是史塔生在最近的裁军会议上说，美国的“建议”还要以后才能拿出来。
    美国谈判代表为什么要如此吞吞吐吐、故弄玄虚呢？看来，这里面有难言之隐：第一是他奉命要拖延时间，尽量规避协议；第二是美国并没有真正见得天日的裁军方案，因此只好零敲碎打，用一点又一滴不着边际的所谓“新建议”来缓和世界舆论对它的反感，争取外交上的主动。
    美国谈判代表曾经想使人相信美国这一次是真诚地准备达成一些协议，首先是在停止核试验方面。但是当着他被迫逐渐拿出他的底牌来的时候，人们就看到美国用以拖延和阻挠裁军的老手法的印记。美国代表强调，停止核武器试验必须要以签订停止生产制造核武器的裂变物质的协定为先决条件；在裁减常规军备方面，美国主张分阶段，而第二、第三阶段的裁军要取决于“解决政治问题（例如德国统一问题）的进展”。条件提出来了。
    在华盛顿，调子已发生了明显的变化。在6月19日的记者招待会上，美国总统艾森豪威尔还大放“乐观”空气，表示“非常高兴能作出暂时停止（核武器）试验的某种令人满意的安排”。但是，一星期之后，他给这一点加上了繁复的条件：停止试验必须同“结束作武器用的裂变物质的生产、有限的空中视察、普遍武器裁减和全面的普遍视察制度”等等联系起来。这甚至使合众社记者萨克斯顿也承认，艾森豪威尔这个谈话，“表示他从以前的态度后退了”。不仅如此，艾森豪威尔还引用一些御用科学家的意见，力图说明核试验几乎已经成为完全是无害的事情，甚至于——据他说——为了原子科学在和平利用方面的发展，“这些试验必须继续进行下去”。
    为什么美国的裁军谈判代表这样横生枝节，而美国总统又发表这样出尔反尔的谈话呢？美国报纸透露了若干内幕，“新闻周刊”在6月24日报道说，在美国政府内部，有一个强有力的集团，坚决反对在裁军问题上达成任何协议。他们坚持要继续进行原子军备竞赛，因为“美国的国防是以原子武器为基础的”。美国谈判代表所以提出停止制造裂变物质作为停止试验的一个条件，是因为他们认为美国已经储备有足够多的裂变物质，可以“占上风”；而且，如美国某些报纸评论员指出的，他们坚持要求一种“未必能够得到的东西”，就可以实际上阻挠达成协议。
    不过，在美国政府和国会内部，也还有一些人，他们鉴于舆论要求裁军的强大压力，想作得更为巧妙一些，他们想顺水推舟，用一些无伤大雅的“初步协议”，以收到欺蒙舆论的效果，为自己捞一笔政治资本。他们想出来的办法就是：在裁减常规军备方面分成阶段，现在只谈第一阶段的裁军，而用“政治问题”来阻挠下阶段的裁军。按照美国提出来的第一阶段裁减数字，这事实上等于不裁。在停止核武器试验方面，提出暂停试验十个月。按美国“每日新闻”所说：这个建议“危险性很小，因为美国筹划下一批试验大概也需要十个月”。这些就是美国谈判代表葫芦里的药。没有想到苏联率先提出停止核试验的具体建议，打乱了他们的步骤。这使得华盛顿手忙脚乱起来了。
    根本的问题是，华盛顿的当权人们担心，裁军问题上的协议，会产生对于美国垄断资本不利的政治的和经济的影响。这次伦敦会议在一种比较乐观的气氛中复会之后，美国的股票市场上同军备生产有关各行业的股票价格就纷纷下落。这使得美国当局感到需要赶紧作些事情来稳定一下行情。艾森豪威尔正是在这个时候出来修正了他上一次的谈话的。副总统尼克松比他说得还要露骨一些，他说：“在这种（裁军）谈判中，我们的基本目的和动机决不可在于减轻我们的军备负担。”
    和美国政府在裁军问题上的作法相呼应，美国加紧了远东方面的挑衅行动，包括公开宣布废弃朝鲜停战协定中有关禁止向朝鲜运入增援性武器的条款。美联社记者海托华赤裸裸地承认：美国这个破坏朝鲜停战协定的决定，“同裁军会谈的关系是明显而自然的”，因为这有利于制造这样一种借口：同共产党国家签订协定“是不会真正有效的”，因此“在裁军问题上，决不可再作这种险事”。
    所有这些事实，证明了美国非常害怕国际局势的缓和。尽管它在裁军问题上已被国内外舆论的压力逼得不能不装出某些姿态，但是实际上它还是在力图挣扎。
