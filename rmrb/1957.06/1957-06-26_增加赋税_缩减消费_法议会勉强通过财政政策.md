    Increasing Taxes, Reducing Consumption
    French Parliament Barely Passes Fiscal Policy
    Xinhua News Agency, June 25th, Paris Dispatch: Premier Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, on the evening of the 24th, obtained a vote of confidence from the parliament on his fiscal policy by a narrow margin of two hundred and fifty-one votes to two hundred and ten. The fiscal plan proposed by Bourgès-Maunoury calls for a tax increase of 150 billion francs this year and a reduction in budget expenditures of 250 billion francs.
    It is believed that most of the deputies who voted in favor did so because they agreed with the government's Algerian policy and hoped to approve the two treaties of the Western European "Common Market" and "Euratom" as soon as possible before deciding to support the government.

    增加赋税  缩减消费
    法议会勉强通过财政政策
    据新华社25日讯  巴黎消息：布歇—莫努里总理24日晚间以二百五十一票对二百一十票的微弱多数，获得了议会对他的财政政策的信任投票。布歇—莫努里提出的财政计划要求在今年增税一千五百亿法郎，削减预算开支二千五百亿法郎。
    人们认为，投赞成票的议员中，大多数是因为同意政府的阿尔及利亚政策，并且巴望尽快批准西欧“共同市场”和“原子联营”两个条约才决定支持政府的。
