Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th -- At an enlarged symposium jointly convened by the Sichuan Provincial Committee and the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League from the 25th to the 27th, Zhang Songtao and Zhao Yiming delivered speeches exposing the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Pan Dakui.

　　Zhang Songtao, Secretary-General of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League decided to fully accept the leadership of the Party in May 1948, he returned to Sichuan from Hong Kong. Zhang Bojun asked him to bring a secret cloth strip to Liang Shuming and Fan Puzhai, who were in Chongqing at the time, advocating the "third road." Zhang Songtao said that Zhang Bojun did not agree with "leaning to one side" at the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League. Zhang also said at the meeting, "Without political capital, you can't speak up in a coalition government." This shows that Zhang Bojun's political ambitions have been long-standing. Zhang Songtao also revealed that when Luo Longji came to Chengdu this year, when Fan Puzhai treated Luo Longji to a meal, Luo Longji affirmed in his remarks that Hu Feng had been wrongly accused, and Fan Puzhai echoed this sentiment.

　　Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that Pan Dakui's opposition to the leadership of the Party and his opposition to socialism have historical roots. After the Huaihai Campaign in 1948, Pan Dakui even said that the future situation would be a north-south confrontation, reflecting his thoughts and feelings at that time. Pan Dakui's elder brother was a local tyrant in Kai County. After being arrested by the government in 1951, Pan Dakui expressed his dissatisfaction.

　　Zhao Yiming revealed that although Pan Dakui held the positions of Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, he was not satisfied. Last year, when additional vice governors were being elected, Pan Dakui told him that the position of Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference was not as good as that of Vice Governor. This is clearly not individualism, but a kind of political ambition. Zhao Yiming also exposed some fallacies of Pan Dakui in sowing discord since the rectification movement. Pan Dakui once said that since the rectification movement, the opinions raised by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji in the League were good, especially those of Luo Longji; Shi Liang had performed the worst this time. Pan Dakui also said at the work conference of the League's provincial and municipal committees on higher education that the Party committee system in universities and colleges had caused losses to the work over the past few years and should be changed.

　　Zhao Yiming also exposed some reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League. Zhang Bojun viciously said at the meeting that the internal affairs of the democratic parties in the past few years were entirely decided by the Communist Party. Zhao Yiming said that due to the influence of Zhang Bojun's ideas, at the National Work Conference, proposals to accept the leadership of the Communist Party were met with tangible and intangible opposition. For example, Huang Yaomian originally proposed in his central speech that mutual supervision should not lead to the idea of being equal. In today's view, this proposal is worthy of attention, but it was cancelled due to the opposition of the majority. Also, in the initial draft of the concluding speech of the conference, it was mentioned that mutual supervision should not be used to put forward "ulterior motives." In today's view, this proposal is also appropriate, but it was also cancelled because of opposition. Zhao Yiming also pointed out that at the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji both said that the work of the democratic parties should be greatly expanded in the future, but neither of them mentioned the socialist construction cause and the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　民盟四川盟员揭露
    章伯钧政治野心由来已久  罗隆基肯定胡风是搞错了
    新华社成都29日电　在25日到27日民盟四川省委和成都市委联合召开的扩大座谈会上，张松涛和赵一明发言揭露了章伯钧、罗隆基、潘大逵的反动言行。
    民盟成都市委秘书主任张松涛说，1948年5月民盟中央三中全会决定全面接受党的领导后，他从香港回四川，章伯钧曾托他带一张秘密布条给当时在重庆的梁漱溟和范朴斋，内容是鼓吹走第三条路线。张松涛说，章伯钧在民盟三中全会上就不赞成一面倒，章在会上还说：“没有政治资本，在联合政府也说不起话。”可见章伯钧的政治野心由来已久。张松涛还揭露今年罗隆基来成都时，在范朴斋请罗隆基吃饭的时候，罗隆基在言谈中肯定胡风是搞错了，范朴斋也随声附和。
    民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明发言揭露潘大逵反对党的领导、反对社会主义的思想是有历史根源的。1948年淮海战役以后，潘大逵还说将来的形势是南北对峙的局面，反映了他当时的思想感情。潘大逵的哥哥是开县的恶霸，1951年经政府逮捕后，潘大逵曾经表示不满。
    赵一明揭露说，潘大逵虽然担任了省政协副主席、民盟四川省委主任委员职务，但他并不满意，去年增选副省长时，潘大逵曾向他表示省政协副主席不如副省长，这显然不是什么个人主义，而是一种政治野心。赵一明还揭发了潘大逵在整风运动以来挑拨离间的一些谬论，潘大逵曾说，整风以来，盟内以章伯钧、罗隆基提的意见为好，特别是罗隆基提的意见最好；史良这次表现得最不好。潘大逵还在民盟省、市委高教工作会议上说，几年来大专学校的党委制已经为工作造成了损失，应当加以改变。
    赵一明还揭发了章伯钧、罗隆基在民盟全国工作会议上的一些反动言行。章伯钧在会上恶毒地说过去几年民主党派的内部事务完全是共产党决定的。赵一明说，由于章伯钧的这些思想影响，在全国工作会议上，有人提出要接受共产党的领导的问题都遭到了有形无形的反对，例如黄药眠原有的中心发言上提出不要因为互相监督就产生平起平坐的思想，在今天看来，这种提法完全是值得注意的，但当时却在多数人反对下取消了。又如在大会总结发言的初稿上，曾经提到不要利用互相监督来提出“别有用心”的意见，今天看来这个提法也是恰当的，但也因为遭到反对而取消了。赵一明还指出在民盟全国工作会议上，章伯钧、罗隆基在会上都说今后民主党派工作要大干一番，但是他们都没有提到社会主义建设事业和共产党的领导。
