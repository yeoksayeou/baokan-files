Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st - Two South Vietnamese naval officers who recently defected from South Vietnam to North Vietnam told foreign journalists in Hanoi today that the South Vietnamese army is now completely controlled by the United States. The South Vietnamese army, navy, air force, and various military schools all have American officers. The United States is vigorously eliminating French influence in the South Vietnamese army. The South Vietnamese army has long switched to American-style uniforms. South Vietnamese officers are no longer sent to France for training. Officers previously trained by the French are discriminated against.

Ding Jiaxiang and Fang Chunxian, former deputy captains of the "Lam Giang" and "Ning Giang" transport ships of the Ngo Dinh Diem navy who defected to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also spoke of the arrogance and brutality of American officers, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among South Vietnamese officers and soldiers. An incident of South Vietnamese officers and American officers fighting occurred in the Saigon military club.

Speaking of the morale of the South Vietnamese army, Ding Jiaxiang said that naval morale was low. Many people have fled home. These two South Vietnamese officers originally lived in Hanoi and went to France to study in 1953 to escape Bao Dai's conscription order. They pointed out that many people who do not have families in North Vietnam also want to flee to North Vietnam.

    投奔北越的两个南越军官说
    美国完全控制南越军队
    据新华社河内1日电　最近从南越投奔到北越来的两多南越海军军官今天对驻河内的外国记者们说，南越军队现在完全被美国所控制。南越陆海空军和各种军事学校都有美国军官。美国正在大力消除法国在南越军队的影响。南越军队早已换上美国式军装。南越军官再也不派到法国训练。以前由法国培养的军官遭到歧视。
    投奔越南民主共和国的前吴庭艳海军“林江号”、“宁江号”运输舰副舰长丁家祥和方春闲还谈到美国军官的盛气凌人和横蛮态度引起南越官兵的普遍不满。在西贡的军人俱乐部就曾经发生过南越军官和美国军官殴打的事件。
    谈到南越军队士气，丁家祥说，海军士气低落。有许多人逃回家去。这两位南越军官原来家在河内，在1953年为了逃避保大的征兵令而到法国去学习。他们指出，有许多家不在北越的人也很想逃到北越来。
