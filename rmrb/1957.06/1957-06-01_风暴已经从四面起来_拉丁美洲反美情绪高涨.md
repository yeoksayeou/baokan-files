Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 30th, American newspapers have recently been reporting with considerable alarm about the rising anti-American sentiment in Latin America.

    Military commentator George Eliot, in an article published in the "New York American Journal," admitted that the United States is "encountering very unpleasant things on the vast southern continent." He believes that the reason for this trouble is that the United States supports reactionary dictatorial regimes in many Latin American countries, supplying them with weapons under military "aid" agreements.

    The "Denver Post" mentioned that the US Ambassador to Cuba, Gardner, handed over American tanks to the Batista government to suppress the Cuban insurgents. This open interference by the American ambassador in Cuba's internal affairs aroused protests from the Cuban public. Gardner was finally forced to resign and leave the country. The newspaper wrote that the United States has incurred "the hatred of Latin Americans" by supplying weapons and helping dictators maintain power.

    The influential "New York Times" published an article entitled "An Atmosphere of Political Tension Envelops Latin America," expressing great concern about the precariousness of the reactionary regimes fostered by the United States in some Latin American countries and the upsurge of popular movements in these countries.

    The newspaper pointed out that the United States continues to supply weapons to dictators to deal with the people of Latin American countries. This has already created "serious difficulties" in Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, Cuba, Chile, and other countries. The newspaper worriedly wrote: "Storms are rising from all sides."

    “风暴已经从四面起来”
    拉丁美洲反美情绪高涨
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：美国报纸近来不无惊慌地报道拉丁美洲反美情绪高涨的情况。
    军事评论员乔治·埃利奥特在“纽约美国人日报”上发表的一篇文章中承认，美国在“南面辽阔大陆上碰到十分不愉快的事”。他认为，造成这种麻烦的原因是美国支持许多拉丁美洲国家的反动独裁统治，根据军事“援助”协定，供给它们武器。
    丹佛出版的“邮报”提到美国驻古巴大使加德纳把美国坦克交给巴蒂斯塔政府，供镇压古巴起义者之用。这位美国大使公开干涉古巴内政的事引起古巴公众的抗议。加德纳终于不得不辞职，并且离开这个国家。报纸写道，由于供售武器和帮助独裁者把持政权，美国招来了“拉丁美洲人的仇视”。
    有影响的“纽约时报”刊载了一篇题为“政局紧张的气氛笼罩着拉丁美洲”的文章，文章对美国在拉丁美洲某些国家扶植起来的反动政权的不巩固以及这些国家的人民运动的高涨，表示十分耽心。
    报纸指出，美国继续不断地把武器供售给独裁者，来对付拉丁美洲国家的人民。这已经在哥伦比亚、尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、海地、古巴、智利和其他一些国家造成了“严重的困难”。报纸耽忧地写道：“风暴已经从四面起来”。
