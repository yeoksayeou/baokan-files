Xinhua News Agency dispatch: An increasing number of congressmen and newspapers in the United States are criticizing the government's policy towards China and demanding that this policy be modified.

Senator Smathers, a Democratic Senator from Florida and a member of the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, said in a speech that the U.S. government's current policy of non-recognition of the Chinese government is "ignoring the realities of life." He said that the United States, by "shutting its windows and not looking at this market," will not only harm itself, but also its "allies." He stated that it is now time for the United States to adopt a "realistic" view on its relations with China, and that the United States should conduct trade with China as soon as possible.

Senator Morse, a Democratic Senator from Oregon, also said on the 2nd that trade with China is something the United States "should do." He said: "The British have adopted a more realistic foreign policy," while the U.S. government's foreign policy is "alienating the United States from millions of people around the world."

Senator Ellender, a Democratic Senator from Louisiana, also expressed doubt about the "embargo" policy. He called for a "thorough study" of this policy and an investigation into the "possibility" of allowing American companies to sell non-strategic materials to China. Referring to the U.S. government's ban on journalists visiting China, Ellender also said that this practice by the U.S. government is "short-sighted" because allowing journalists to go to China would allow "the Chinese to better understand Americans."

Representative Moss, a Democratic Congressman, also advocated allowing American journalists to interview in China in order to "seize this opportunity" to understand China.

“Christian Science Monitor” reporter Stanford reported from Washington that the British decision and the Taiwan situation will undoubtedly force Congress to "consider America's Far East policy more specifically and deeply."

The reporter believes that Japan, West Germany, Italy, and "many other countries eager for trade" will follow Britain's example, "which will make the United States increasingly isolated in its policy of opposing China."

"Chicago Sun-Times" reporter Cooke also said that some American businessmen, such as Ford, and shipowners in California and Oregon are interested in trading with China.

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" said, "Although the U.S. State Department intends to continue to avoid establishing any contact with China in the future, this policy will soon go bankrupt."

At the same time, some newspapers advocated continuing the current Far East policy. New York's "I3 News" suggested that the U.S. Seventh Fleet stationed in the Far East waters provide Chiang Kai-shek's ships with "unofficial assistance to blockade" ships from Western countries heading to the People's Republic of China.

    美国许多议员主张正视现实
    要求修改对中国政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国有越来越多的国会议员和报纸批评政府对中国的政策，并且要求修改这个政策。
    参议院州际和对外商业委员会委员、佛罗里达州民主党参议员斯马特斯在一次演说中说，美国政府目前采取不承认中国政府的政策，这是“无视生活中的现实”。他说，美国“关起窗来不看这个市场”，不但将损害美国自己，而且也将损害美国的“盟友”。他说，现在已经是美国在对中国的关系上采取“现实”观点的时候了，美国应该尽速同中国进行贸易。
    俄勒冈州民主党参议员莫尔斯在2日也说，同中国贸易是美国“应该做的事”。他说：“英国人已经采取了比较现实的外交政策”，而美国政府的外交政策却使“美国同世界各地的千百万人疏远起来”。
    路易斯安那州民主党参议员埃伦德也对“禁运”政策表示怀疑。他要求“彻底研究”这个政策，并且调查允许美国公司把非战略物资卖给中国的“可能性”。埃伦德在谈到美国政府禁止记者访问中国的问题时还说，美国政府这种做法是“眼光短浅”的，因为让记者到中国去可以使“中国人更加了解美国人”。
    民主党众议员摩斯也主张让美国记者到中国采访，以便“利用这个机会”来了解中国。
    “基督教科学箴言报”记者史坦福自华盛顿报道说，英国的决定和台湾事件，无疑将迫使国会“更加特别认真地、深刻地考虑美国的远东政策。”
    这位记者认为，日本、西德、意大利和“许多其他渴望贸易的国家”将追随英国的榜样，“这就会使得美国在它的反对中国的政策中越来越陷于孤立”。
    “芝加哥太阳时报”记者库也说，美国有些商人如福特、加利福尼亚和俄勒冈的船主对同中国进行贸易感到兴趣。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说，“尽管美国国务院企图今后仍然不同中国建立任何接触，但是，这种政策将会很快遭到破产。”
    在这同时，还有一部分报纸主张继续执行目前的远东政策。纽约“一三新闻”建议驻扎在远东海洋上的美国第七舰队，给予蒋介石船只“非正式的援助来封锁”开往中华人民共和国的西方国家的船只。
