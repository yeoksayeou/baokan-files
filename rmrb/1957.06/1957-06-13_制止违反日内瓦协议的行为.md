　　Halt Actions Violating the Geneva Accords
　　By People's Daily Commentator

The Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina concluded nearly three years ago, yet the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not been achieved. In a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on June 8, Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again raised this issue, which is closely related to peace in Asia, to the world.

According to the Geneva Accords, the responsible authorities of both North and South Vietnam should, from July 20, 1955, hold consultations on the issue of achieving peaceful reunification through national general elections, and the elections should be held in July 1956. However, three years have passed. Although the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made many efforts, these provisions of the Geneva Accords have not been implemented due to the obstruction and refusal to cooperate by the South Vietnamese authorities supported by the United States. This extremely abnormal situation cannot but arouse serious attention from all parties concerned about peace in Indochina.

As Minister Pham Van Dong correctly pointed out in his letter, the current situation in Vietnam is the result of the South Vietnamese authorities pursuing U.S. policy. The U.S. policy is to create a divided Vietnam and maintain a source of tension on the Indochinese Peninsula. With the backing of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam dares to so blatantly disregard the Geneva Accords, disregard the authority of the International Commission, ignore the suggestions made by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and refuse to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam through general elections. During Ngo Dinh Diem's recent visit to the United States, the United States gave him great support. The joint communique issued by Ngo Dinh Diem and the United States did not mention the implementation of the Geneva Accords at all. This shows the extent to which they have disregarded the Asian people and world public opinion who have worked hard to achieve peace in Indochina.

The peaceful reunification of Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords is an important step in easing tensions in Asia. The current situation, in which the United States controls South Vietnam and turns it into a U.S. military base, is a serious threat to peace in the Indochina region and the entire Southeast Asia region. In his letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Minister Pham Van Dong pointed out many serious instances of the South Vietnamese authorities undermining the Geneva Accords with the support of the United States, and this situation must not be allowed to continue to develop.

The Geneva Accords must be fully implemented. To this end, the aggressive forces of the United States must withdraw from South Vietnam, in favor of the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. We hope that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference will take effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and implemented, and immediately stop all actions by the South Vietnamese authorities that violate the military and political clauses of the Geneva Accords.

　　制止违反日内瓦协议的行为
　　本报评论员
    关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议，结束已经将近三年了，可是越南的和平统一却到现在还没有实现。越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同在6月8日写给日内瓦会议两位主席的信件，再次向全世界提出了这个同亚洲和平密切有关的问题。
    按照日内瓦协议，越南的南北双方负责当局，应该从1955年7月20日起，就通过全国普选实现和平统一的问题进行协商，而普选应当在1956年7月举行。但是，三年过去了。虽然越南民主共和国方面作了多方面的努力，但是由于受到美国支持的南越当局的阻挠和拒绝合作，日内瓦协议的这些规定，却始终没有能够实现。这种极不正常的情况，不能不引起关心印度支那和平的有关各方的严重注意。
    正如范文同部长在他的信件中正确地指出的，越南目前的情况，是南越当局奉行美国政策的结果。而美国的政策就是要制造一个分裂的越南，在印度支那半岛上保持一个紧张局势的根源。由于美国的撑腰，南越吴庭艳集团才敢于这样公然蔑视日内瓦协议，蔑视国际委员会的职权，不理睬日内瓦会议两位主席所提出的建议，拒绝通过普选来实现越南的和平统一。在最近吴庭艳访问美国的时候，美国给了吴庭艳以很大的支持。在吴庭艳和美国发表的公报中，关于实施日内瓦协议的问题竟然只字不提。这说明他们对于曾经为实现印度支那和平而努力的亚洲人民和世界舆论，已经蔑视到了何种程度。
    越南根据日内瓦协议实现和平统一，是和缓亚洲紧张局势的重要步骤。目前这种美国控制南越、变南越为美国军事基地的局面，是对印度支那地区和整个东南亚地区的和平的严重威胁。范文同部长在给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中，指出南越当局在美国支持下破坏日内瓦协议的许多情况，都是十分严重的，决不能再听任这种情况继续发展下去了。
    日内瓦协议必须彻底实施。为此，美国的侵略势力必须退出南越，以有利于越南的和平统一。我们希望，日内瓦会议的两位主席能够采取有效措施，使日内瓦协议得到尊重和履行，并且立即制止南越当局一切违反日内瓦协议的军事条款和政治条款的行为。
