Inheriting the Glorious Tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, Peking University Students Issue a Call to Arms
Unite All Students Nationwide! Thoroughly Crush the Rightists' Offensive!
More Than 6,700 Students Sign Pledges: We Will Always Be Loyal to the Communist Party! Loyal to Socialism!

　　(Our Dispatch) On the 26th, at the request of more than 6,000 students who signed their names, the Peking University Student Union issued "A Letter to Students of All Institutions of Higher Education Nationwide." The letter angrily exposed the sabotage activities of rightist elements among Peking University students, such as Tan Tianrong and Liu Qidi, who echoed bourgeois rightist elements in society during the rectification campaign by spreading various reactionary remarks inside and outside the university, distorting the university's Party rectification movement, organizing reactionary cliques, and frantically attacking the Party and the people. They called on students from all institutions of higher education nationwide to stand with them in waging a resolute struggle against the rightist elements to achieve a final and complete victory. The full text of the letter is as follows:

　　A Letter to Students of All Institutions of Higher Education Nationwide

Dear students:

　　In these extraordinary days, we, like you, with a red heart of love for the Party and love for socialism, are actively engaged in the rectification movement and the struggle against the rightist elements. We have been constantly receiving letters from you, from which we have drawn great encouragement. At the same time, we have also learned that a small number of ill-intentioned rightist elements in our university have been distorting the Peking University's rectification movement among you, spreading reactionary remarks through the so-called "democracy relay baton." These remarks have been forcefully refuted by the majority of students in various universities. We say: You have fought back well! We have formed close comrades-in-arms in the struggle against anti-socialist words and deeds. In order to fight better, we would like to introduce to students across the country the true situation of our university's rectification and anti-rightist struggle.

　　In mid-May, the Peking University rectification movement had already begun. Teachers were "blooming" and "contending" at symposiums convened by the Party committee, offering many valuable opinions on the Party's work. At this time, our enthusiasm for helping the Party in its rectification was high, and everyone couldn't wait to take action. On the one hand, we actively offered opinions at class meetings and symposiums, and on the other hand, big-character posters were put up one after another. The Party committee, in response to the students' demands, immediately called on everyone to "bloom" and "contend" extensively, welcoming everyone to offer criticisms in various ways to help the Party in its rectification. Thus, we were all drawn into this great rectification movement. Big-character posters covered the walls. Many sharp opinions were raised about the Party committee, the university, and the administrative departments, severely criticizing the leadership's subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism. Many students spoke their minds at the symposiums, actively dismantling "walls" and filling "ditches." What a warm and moving scene this was! However, at this moment, a small number of rightist elements, echoing the rightist elements in society, launched a frantic attack on the Party and socialism. Zhang Yuanxun's and Shen Zeyi's poem "It's Time" served as their oath to attack the Party and socialism. Tan Tianrong, a senior in the Physics Department, fired the first shot at the Party with "A Poisonous Weed," saying that Marxism had begun to move towards "its own opposite" since 1895, that "Further Discussion on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" was naked idealism, that the People's Daily was "the Great Wall blocking the truth," and he cursed the "Three Goods Students" as "idiots," and that he wanted to organize a "million-strong army" including anti-socialist, counter-revolutionary, and anti-people demons to attack the Party. This "poisonous weed" aroused the indignation of the majority of our students, and in no time, big-character posters refuting it were posted everywhere, demanding "eradication of the poisonous weed."

　　The reactionary remarks of the rightist elements were filled with the extreme hatred of the decadent exploiting classes towards the Party and socialism. Liu Qidi defended Hu Feng, saying: "Hu Feng is definitely not a counter-revolutionary." Some even proposed that the "Party committee should roll off its 'throne.'" Tan Tianrong, Liu Qidi, and other rightist elements colluded to form the reactionary clique "Hundred Flowers Society," spreading reactionary fallacies, attempting to "launch a democratic movement from the bottom up," and "fight for democracy," "fight for freedom," and "fight for human rights" from the Party. In order to remove obstacles to the rectification, and in order to defend socialism, the majority of students rose up to expose the rightist elements' conspiracies and refute their fallacies. Debates and speeches were being fiercely conducted in large and small debate meetings and speeches. Cheng Haiguo (Lin Xiling), a student from Renmin University, came to our university to conduct a provocative incitement with rumors and slanders, which aroused our great indignation and was immediately met with fierce counterattacks. We know that a small number of rightist elements are a counter-current in our era, and their attempt to destroy our Party and replace socialism with capitalism is absolutely impossible. We further used various methods to give them a larger-scale counterattack. Students published publications such as "Waves Washing Sand," "May," "Contending," "Discussion," "Woodpecker," and "Reasoning." These anti-rightist publications and pamphlets were warmly welcomed and supported by the majority of students.

　　Rightist elements have no market at Peking University. Tan Tianrong and other rightist elements in our university vainly hoped to peddle their reactionary wares in other universities. Under the guise of introducing rectification experience, they went to Tianjin to swindle and deceive. They spread anti-socialist remarks at Nankai University, Tianjin University, Tianjin Normal College, and other schools; they distributed the so-called "democracy relay baton" to Fudan University, East China Normal University, and other schools, attempting to ignite hatred of socialism everywhere. Our comrades-in-arms in Tianjin and Shanghai gave them a strong blow, exposing and criticizing them profoundly. Students! You have done a really good job!

　　Rightist elements were preparing a publication called "Square" to promote their anti-socialist views. When they sent the manuscript to the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory for printing, it aroused great anger among the workers. The workers firmly refuted these reactionary remarks, stating that they would never print words that opposed themselves. The editors of "Square" reported to the students after returning to campus on how they had "been struggled" at the factory, attempting to win the students' sympathy and support. However, the students' eyes were bright, and we sympathized and supported not the editors of "Square," but the just actions of the worker comrades. That evening, the chairman of the Student Union read the letter from the workers of the No. 1 Printing Factory to us. When it was read that "Socialism is our lifeline, and we must resolutely defend it. We resolutely will not print the reactionary publication 'Square'," our hands turned red from clapping. The firm stance of the worker comrades deeply educated us and boosted our confidence in the struggle.

　　Chairman Mao's report and the People's Daily editorial dealt a fatal blow to the rightist elements on a nationwide scale. However, Tan Tianrong and others who were obsessed with their errors, still spoke with one voice with bourgeois rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, and Zhang Naiqi. This is nothing more than their last struggle before their complete bankruptcy. Here, we once again warn the rightist elements that attempting to find a market among our university students is a delusion, a dream! We are now launching a comprehensive and systematic criticism and counterattack against the rightist elements. We must expose the reactionary essence of the rightists from the bone. At present, big-character posters and pamphlets exposing and criticizing the rightist elements are appearing in even greater numbers. The radio station broadcasts articles criticizing the rightist elements every day. The entire university has held mass rallies to comprehensively criticize rightist elements such as Tan Tianrong and Long Yinghua. The torrent of battle is washing away all the filth on the road ahead with an overwhelming force, heading towards the vast ocean of socialism.

　　In this frenzied attack, the rightist elements once vainly attempted to use the banner of "May Fourth" democracy. We, the students of Peking University and the youth of all China, will never allow them to tarnish this glorious banner. Because we know that the seeds of democracy sown by our fathers and brothers in the "May Fourth" Movement can only blossom into bright flowers and bear great fruits under the leadership of the Communist Party and in the soil of socialism. Today, whoever tries to use the banner of "May Fourth" democracy to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism is a traitor to the "May Fourth" spirit and a sinner of the Chinese people.

　　Here, we pledge: Inherit the glorious tradition of revolutionary martyrs since the "May Fourth" Movement, and be forever loyal to the Communist Party! Loyal to socialism! We pledge: We will never cease fighting until the rightist elements' offensive is thoroughly crushed!

　　Students, unite and fight together!

　　With best regards,
　　Peking University Student Union (Signed by 6,701 students on campus)

　　继承“五四”光荣传统  北大学生发出战斗号召
　　全国同学团结起来！彻底粉碎右派的进攻！
　　六千七百多名同学签名宣誓：我们永远忠于共产党！忠于社会主义！
    本报讯  26日，北京大学学生会在六千多学生签名要求下，发出了“致全国高等学校同学的一封信”。信中愤怒地揭露了在整风运动中，北京大学学生中的右派分子谭天荣、刘奇弟等，和社会上资产阶级右派分子相呼应，在校内外散布各种反动言论，歪曲学校党的整风运动，组织反动小集团，猖狂地向党和人民进攻的破坏活动。他们呼吁全国各高等学校的同学们和他们站在一起向右派分子进行坚决的斗争，以取得最后彻底的胜利。这封信的全文如下：
　　致全国高等学校同学的一封信亲爱的同学们：
    在这不平凡的日子里，我们和你们一样，怀着一颗爱党、爱社会主义的赤心，积极地投入整风运动和反右派分子的斗争。我们不断地收到你们的来信，从你们的来信中，我们得到了很大的鼓舞。同时，我们也知道了我校的少数别有用心的右派分子在你们中间对北京大学的整风运动进行了种种歪曲。用所谓“民主接力棒”向你们散布反动的言论。这些言论已遭到各校广大同学的有力驳斥。我们说：你们反击得好！在反对社会主义言行的斗争中，我们已结成亲密的战友。为了更好地战斗，我们愿意在这里向全国同学介绍一下我校整风和反右派斗争的真实情况。
    5月中，北京大学整风运动已经开始。老师们在党委召开的座谈会上大“鸣”大“放”，对党的工作提了很多宝贵意见。这时，我们帮助党整风的热情很高，大家迫不及待的也行动起来了。一方面在班会和座谈会上积极地提意见，另一方面大字报一张接了一张地贴出来了。党委会适应同学们的要求，立即号召大家大“鸣”大“放”，欢迎大家用各种方式提出批评，帮助党整风。于是我们都卷入了这一场伟大的整风运动。大字报贴得满墙都是。对党委、学校、系行政提出了很多尖锐的意见，严厉地批评了领导上的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义。许多同学在座谈会上讲出了心里话，积极动手拆“墙”填“沟”。这是多么热烈动人的场面啊！然而，就在这时，少数右派分子和社会上的右派分子互相呼应，向党和社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。张元勋、沈泽宜的诗“是时候了”作了他们向党、向社会主义进攻的誓师词。物理系四年级谭天荣的“一株毒草”向党开了第一枪，他说：马克思主义从1895年起就开始走向“自身的反面”，说“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”是赤裸裸的唯心主义，说人民日报是“封锁真理的长城”，并破口大骂三好学生是“白痴”，他要组织一支包括反社会主义、反革命、反人民魔鬼在内的“百万大军”向党进攻。这“一株毒草”引起了我们广大同学的愤慨，不一会工夫，到处都贴满了反击的大字报，纷纷要求“铲除毒草”。
    右派分子的反动言论中充满了没落的剥削阶级对党、对社会主义的极端仇恨。刘奇弟为胡风喊冤说：“胡风决不是反革命。”还有人提出要“党委从‘宝座’上滚下来”。谭天荣、刘奇弟和其它右派分子拧在一起，组织了反动小集团——“百花学社”，散布反动谬论，企图“开展自下而上的民主运动”，向党“争民主”、“争自由”、“争人权”。为了扫除整风的障碍，为了捍卫社会主义，广大同学奋起揭露右派分子的阴谋活动，驳斥其谬论。在大大小小的辩论会、演说会上论战在激烈地进行着。人民大学的学生程海果（林希翎）来我校进行了一次造谣诬蔑的煽动，引起我们极大的愤慨，当场遭到了猛烈的反击。我们知道，少数右派分子是我们时代中的一股逆流，他们妄想搞垮我们的党，妄想以资本主义代替社会主义，这是绝对办不到的。我们进一步用各种办法给予他们更大规模的反击。同学们出版了“浪淘沙”、“五月”、“争鸣”、“论谈”、“啄木鸟”、“说理”等刊物。这些反右派的刊物和小册子得到了广大同学的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    右派分子在北大是没有市场的。我校右派分子谭天荣等妄想在其它学校贩卖他们的反动货色，他们假借介绍整风经验的名义，跑到天津去招摇撞骗。他们在南开大学、天津大学、天津师范学院等校传播反社会主义的言论；他们向复旦大学、华东师范大学等校散发所谓“民主接力棒”，企图到处燃起对社会主义的仇恨。我们天津和上海的战友们给了他们有力的打击，对他们进行了深刻的揭露和批判。同学们！你们干得真好！
    右派分子筹办了一个宣传他们反社会主义言论的刊物——“广场”。当他们把稿件送到北京印刷一厂印刷时，引起了工人们极大的愤怒，工人们坚决地批驳了这些反动的言论，表示他们决不从自己手中印出反对自己的言论。“广场”的编委们回校后向同学们报告了他们在工厂“被斗”的情况，企图博得同学们的同情和支持。但是，同学们的眼睛是明亮的，我们同情和支持的不是“广场”的编委们，却是工人同志们的正义行动。当天晚上学生会主席宣读了印刷一厂工人给我们的信，当念到“社会主义是我们的命根子，我们要坚决保卫她。我们坚决不印反动刊物‘广场’”时，我们双手都拍红了。工人同志们的坚定立场深深地教育了我们，鼓舞了我们斗争的信心。
    毛主席的报告和人民日报的社论更在全国范围内给了右派分子以致命的打击。但是，执迷不悟的谭天荣等，仍然和章伯钧、储安平、章乃器等资产阶级右派分子一个鼻孔出气，这只不过是他们在彻底破产前的最后挣扎，这里，我们再一次警告右派分子企图在我们大学生中寻找市场，这是妄想，这是做梦！现在我们正对右派分子展开全面的、系统的批判和反击，我们要从骨子里揭露右派的反动本质。目前，揭露批判右派分子的大字报和小册子更大量出现了，广播台天天播送着批判右派分子的稿件，全校召开了群众大会，全面批判了谭天荣、龙英华等右派分子。战斗的洪流正以排山倒海之势，冲洗着前进道路上的一切污秽，奔向那浩瀚的社会主义海洋。
    右派分子在这次猖狂的进攻中，曾经妄想利用“五四”民主的旗帜，我们北京大学的学生和全中国的青年，决不容许他们糟踏这一光荣的旗帜。因为我们知道，我们的父兄在“五四”撒下的民主的种子，只有在共产党的领导下，在社会主义的土壤里才能开出鲜艳的花，结出硕大的果。今天，谁要利用“五四”民主的旗帜来反对共产党、反对社会主义，谁就是“五四”精神的叛徒，是中国人民的罪人。
    在这里，我们宣誓：继承“五四”以来革命先烈的光荣传统，永远忠于共产党！忠于社会主义！我们宣誓：不彻底粉碎右派分子的进攻，决不收兵！
    同学们，团结起来共同战斗吧！
              此致敬礼
        北京大学学生会（在校同学六千七百零一人签名）
