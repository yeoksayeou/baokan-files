Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since Britain announced the relaxation of trade restrictions on China, governments and trade figures in various countries have been eager to try and follow in Britain's footsteps.

The Dutch Foreign Ministry announced on June 14 that the Dutch government would relax trade restrictions on China, North Korea, and Vietnam to bring them in line with trade restrictions on Eastern European countries.

The Belgian government issued a public statement on the evening of June 14, deciding to "modify" the "trade restrictions" it imposed on exports to China.

At the same time, economic circles and local council members in Osaka, the industrial center of Japan, unanimously demanded that the Japanese government follow Britain in relaxing the "embargo" on China. The Osaka Prefectural Assembly has passed a resolution requesting the government to consider the industrial and trade characteristics of the Osaka region and relax the "embargo" on China. The Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry has also decided to request that Nobusuke Kishi negotiate with the United States on relaxing the "embargo" issue. This joint organization of business leaders expressed dissatisfaction with the "mediatory" attitude adopted by the Japanese government and demanded that the government follow Britain's example.

The West German Economic "Eastern Committee" demanded on the 14th that the government strive as soon as possible to relax the list of embargoed goods to China. In a telegram to the government, the committee stated that it believes the West German government should actively strive to relax the embargo within the fifteen-nation "China Committee" currently considering this list in Paris.

The "Eastern Committee," which is responsible for negotiating trade agreements with socialist countries, will send representatives to China in October to negotiate trade agreements.

    要求自由贸易的浪潮冲破美国堤坝
    荷兰比利时决定放宽禁运
    日本大阪经济界和西德贸易团体要求仿效英国
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：自从英国宣布放宽对中国贸易限制以后，各国政府以及贸易界人士都跃跃欲试，步英国后尘。
    荷兰外交部6月14日宣布，荷兰政府将放宽对中国、朝鲜和越南的贸易限制，使它同对东欧国家的贸易限制相一致。
    比利时政府6月14日晚上发表公报，决定“修改”它在对中国出口方面所实行的“贸易限制”。
    与此同时，日本产业中心——大阪的经济界和地方议会议员们一致要求日本政府追随英国，放宽对中国的“禁运”。大阪府议会已经通过一项决议，要求政府考虑到大阪地区的产业和贸易特点，放宽对中国的“禁运”。大阪商工会议所也决定要求岸信介同美国谈判放宽“禁运”问题。这个工商界人士的联合组织对日本政府采取的“调解”态度表示不满，要求政府仿效英国的做法。
    西德经济“东方委员会”14日要求政府尽快争取放宽对华禁运的货单。委员会在给政府的电报里说，它认为西德政府应该赶紧在正在巴黎考虑这个货单的十五国“中国委员会”里积极争取放宽禁运。
    负责同社会主义国家商订贸易协定的“东方委员会”将在10月间派代表到中国商订贸易协定。
