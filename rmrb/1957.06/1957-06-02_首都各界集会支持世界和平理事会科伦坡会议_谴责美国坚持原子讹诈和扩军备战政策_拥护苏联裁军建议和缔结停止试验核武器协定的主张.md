Xinhua News Agency, June 1st. People from all walks of life in the capital held a rally at the Beijing CPPCC Auditorium tonight to support the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting.

The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting condemned the US government for stubbornly refusing to ban the use and testing of nuclear weapons, and for persisting in its policy of atomic blackmail and arms expansion. The resolution also stated that the meeting unanimously supported the Soviet disarmament proposals and the call for the conclusion of an international agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing, and reaffirmed that the Chinese people fully support the just struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism! Support the just struggle of the Arab people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty! Support all efforts in the world against war and for peace.

    郭沫若(Guo Moruo) Speaks
Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee and head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting, spoke first at today's meeting. He said: Over the past few years, the World Peace Council has made significant efforts and contributions to mobilizing world opinion and promoting and strengthening the struggles of people of all countries against war and for peace. Now, at a time when the demands for peace from people around the world are rising, the US aggressive bloc is still expanding its armaments and preparing for war, and intensifying the creation of tension. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world look forward to and believe that the Colombo meeting will make new contributions to eliminating the threat of war and further developing the cause of peace.

Guo Moruo said that it is particularly worth pointing out that the US warmongers are stepping up their efforts to create tension in Asia, especially in the Taiwan area. US warmongers are infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of other countries in Asia and elsewhere, expanding atomic bases, and recently openly stationed atomic forces and established missile bases in Taiwan, our territory. The American warmongers who occupy Taiwan are arrogant, unreasonable, oppressive, and slaughtering Taiwanese compatriots. These actions fully expose the US attempt to use atomic threats to obstruct our people from liberating Taiwan and regard Taiwan as its colony. The Chinese people express unparalleled anger at the provocations, blackmail, and brutal acts of the US aggressors, and have lodged serious protests. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and Taiwanese compatriots are Chinese people. We will never tolerate the US aggressors establishing atomic bases and killing our own compatriots on our territory. We must drive the US aggressors out of Taiwan.

Guo Moruo said that today, opposition to hydrogen bomb tests and the threat of atomic war has become one of the urgent tasks of the peace movement and will be an important agenda item of this World Peace Council meeting. Atomic weapons are highly destructive, and their consequences will also affect future generations of mankind. They should be banned so that atomic energy can be widely used for peaceful construction. This is the call of all mankind. We Chinese people fully agree with the just proposition put forward by the Soviet Union to reach an agreement on stopping hydrogen bomb tests and to achieve disarmament at an early date, so as to eliminate the threat of war. The Chinese people warmly support the World Peace Council's call at its Berlin meeting in April this year to launch a movement against nuclear weapons in various countries, and resolutely support the just struggle of all countries in the world, especially the Japanese people who have suffered deeply from atomic disasters, against atomic weapons. We also endorse the joint statement recently issued by the Prime Ministers of Ceylon and India calling for a halt to nuclear weapons testing.

Guo Moruo went on to say that this World Peace Council meeting is being held in Asia, which is of great significance especially for the Asian and African countries that are striving for and safeguarding national independence. Because defending peace, especially defending peace in the Asian and African regions, is closely inseparable from national independence. We give our full support to the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We are also deeply convinced that the representatives of the Asian and African countries participating in this World Peace Council meeting will make new efforts and contributions in safeguarding peace and the independence and sovereignty of all countries in the Asian and African regions.

Guo Moruo said that, in general, the world situation is favorable to peace. Although imperialist forces are still trying to stir up international tensions, the general trend of the world is towards relaxation and progress. As long as the peace forces of all countries strengthen unity, continue to promote the Bandung spirit and the Geneva spirit, and bring about peaceful settlement of all international disputes and early realization of consultations among major powers, there is no doubt that the threat of war can be eliminated and lasting world peace can be achieved.

Finally, Guo Moruo, on behalf of the Chinese delegation to the Colombo meeting, told the meeting that they would bring to the Colombo meeting the will of the meeting and the 600 million Chinese people to safeguard world peace and promote human progress. They will do their utmost to work with representatives from all countries to ensure the success of the meeting.

    陈叔通(Chen Shutong) Speaks
Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, then spoke, saying that our 600 million Chinese people have always been loyal comrades-in-arms of the people of all countries in the world in opposing war and defending peace. We have always advocated resolving major international issues through peaceful consultation and concluding peace pacts to replace military blocs. As early as 1951, 340 million Chinese people signed in support of the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact. The Chinese people are one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and are its faithful executors. Our government and our people warmly support the Geneva spirit and the Bandung spirit, and have taken many practical steps to further promote the relaxation of the international situation.

Chen Shutong said that we fully support the just struggle of the people of all countries against nuclear weapons testing and demanding a ban on the use of these weapons. As everyone knows, as early as 1950, more than 250 million Chinese people signed the Stockholm Appeal. In 1955, more than 400 million people signed in support of the World Peace Council's call against the use of atomic weapons. Recently, the China Peace Committee has taken a series of measures to solemnly express the Chinese people's firm support for the struggle of people of all countries to demand the prohibition of the use and cessation of the testing of nuclear weapons, so that atomic energy can serve peaceful construction and the happy life of mankind.

Chen Shutong said that, as everyone knows, the liberation of Taiwan is a matter of China's internal affairs. The United States not only did not withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan, but also used missile forces to obstruct us from liberating Taiwan and to massacre Taiwanese compatriots. This is what the Chinese people will never tolerate. We fully support the recent statement issued by our government, and we will not be intimidated by any threats from the US aggressors. We firmly support the patriotic struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots. We must liberate Taiwan; we must drive the US aggressors out of Taiwan!

Chen Shutong said that we believe that the Colombo meeting will make new and significant contributions to the cause of world peace. The Chinese people will give strong support to all proposals and suggestions that are conducive to peace through this meeting, and will work with the people of all countries to realize these proposals and suggestions.

    包尔汉(Bao Erhan) Speaks
Bao Erhan, Director of the China Islamic Association and Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting, said that since the end of World War II, many nations and countries in Asia and Africa that have long suffered from colonialist enslavement and plunder have successively broken away from the shackles of colonialism and become nationally independent countries. The number of people under colonial rule in Asia and Africa is becoming smaller and smaller, and the ugly colonialist forces are increasingly moving towards death. The Chinese people, who have been liberated, have also suffered the same hardships in the past. They not only have extremely deep feelings for them, but have always sympathized with and supported the struggles of the people of these countries for national independence and against imperialist colonial rule. As everyone knows, the historic Bandung Conference held two years ago precisely reflected this common aspiration of the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa.

Bao Erhan severely condemned the aggressive policy of US imperialism. He pointed out that the United States is not only expanding its aggression in the Middle East, but also hindering India and Indonesia from liberating Goa and West Irian, and trying to control Latin American countries economically and politically, plundering huge profits and resources there every year. At the same time, it is also implementing a policy of "atomic blackmail" in various regions of the world.

Bao Erhan said that we Chinese people will continue to firmly support the just struggle of the Arab countries against colonialism and against the Eisenhower Doctrine, and firmly support the struggles of the people of the entire Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world to safeguard national independence and defend world peace. We firmly believe that only by following the principles of peaceful coexistence, promoting the Bandung spirit and the Geneva spirit, realizing consultations among major powers at an early date, resolving international disputes peacefully, jointly safeguarding peace, and eliminating colonialism, can we guarantee lasting peace and prosperity throughout the world.

Finally, Bao Erhan said, let us Chinese people unite with the Asian and African people and all people in the world who love peace and freedom to work together to defend peace and oppose war. We must bring to Colombo the determination of the 600 million Chinese people to defend peace and their friendly feelings towards the people of the world, so that this peace conference can achieve brilliant achievements and make great contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.Peace activists from five countries, France, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Albania, and Mongolia, said that peace is our common language, and the Colombo conference will definitely succeed.

Next, at the invitation of Guo Moruo, guests from France, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Albania, and Mongolia who attended tonight's meeting spoke one after another. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

Dastier (France), Vice Chairman of the World Peace Council, said that since the Chinese people liberated their motherland in 1949, they have established prosperous friendly cooperation with the people of other countries in the world peace movement. China's contribution to the cause of peace and to the peace movement is a fundamental factor in our movement. He said that today, we are facing a historic peace action, which is the first meeting of the World Peace Council in Asia, in Colombo. On the eve of the Colombo Conference, the arms race and nuclear weapons testing threatened everyone. Our efforts, especially the efforts of the Chinese people, can eliminate threats and open up new prospects for easing the situation and peaceful coexistence. Finally, he hoped to receive a delegation of peace-loving Chinese people in Paris, the capital of France, as soon as possible.

Gasanova (France), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, said that China is a great nation, and it has made great contributions to the freedom of all countries. We firmly believe that the contribution of the Chinese people is decisive in defending world peace.

He said that we are going to Colombo to attend the meeting with the aim of knowing how to better serve world peace and better oppose the forces of war. The French peace movement played an important role in opposing the French government in the Vietnam War in the past, and today it has taken courageous and effective actions in opposing the Algerian War. In the future, we must make the same efforts to stop atomic testing and ban atomic weapons.

He also said that we firmly believe that the Colombo meeting will have an inspiring effect on everyone, and we look forward to the various decisions made by the Colombo meeting with confidence and will implement them.

Kao Chuok (Soviet Union), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, said at the meeting that the Soviet people have consistently and unremittingly struggled for many years to stop the arms race, ban nuclear weapons, and stop testing atomic and hydrogen bombs throughout the world. Soviet peace advocates deeply understand the reasonable wishes of the people who are struggling for the national independence of their countries, and also deeply understand their demands for obtaining the real power to decide their own destiny and not wanting foreign interference in their internal affairs. I fully understand and warmly support their wishes. Kao Chuok said that the fate of realizing lasting peace, peaceful coexistence, and friendship among the people of all countries is in the hands of the people of all countries themselves. If the Colombo meeting expresses the wishes of the people of the world and finds a common language on the major issues that are troubling all mankind today, it will become a meeting of historic significance.

Le Dinh Tham, head of the Vietnamese delegation to the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting and Chairman of the Vietnam Peace Committee, said that we are about to join the glorious Chinese peace fighters to participate in the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting, which is a very important meeting and also the first meeting held in the Asian region. He deeply hopes that this meeting can achieve brilliant achievements and further consolidate the unity and unity of action of the world peace forces, so that the demands for the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all nations, the demands for the reduction of armaments and the abolition of all aggressive military groups can be realized, and that mankind can avoid the incomparable cruelty of the disasters of atomic war, so that the struggle to develop friendship and cultural relations among all nations can achieve victory.

Shtulla, the Albanian representative to the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Albanian National Peace Committee, said that the Albanian people, the Chinese people, and the people of all socialist countries are resolute peace fighters, and they are building a new and happy life. Therefore, for the people of Albania and China and all peace-loving people, peace is as absolutely necessary as water, air, and the sun.

He said that the Albanian people hope to live in an environment of peace and friendship with the people of other countries. They hope to establish friendly relations and economic and cultural ties with the people of other countries on the basis of mutual benefit. They demand to expand the path opened up by the Geneva and Bandung conferences, and demand that the Cold War never be restored.

He is deeply convinced that all peace forces participating in the Colombo meeting will make contributions to further consolidating and expanding the world peace movement, and will work together to find new ways to stop the imperialists' aggressive plans and save mankind from the threat of a devastating atomic war.

Tsegmid, head of the Mongolian delegation to the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting, said that we firmly believe that the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting, which will be held in a few days, will express the wishes of the people of the world. It is a new and important step in the cause of defending peace and will inspire the powerful struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace to continue to rise.

He said that the forces of peace are rising, and the powerful voice of the people demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons is also becoming louder. The ranks of defending peace are constantly strengthened by the outstanding representatives of mankind. As long as everyone works together, peace can be guaranteed, and the people of all countries will definitely be able to realize this wish.

Finally, the meeting unanimously passed the "Resolution of People from All Circles in the Capital of China in Support of the World Peace Council Colombo Meeting."

More than 1,000 people from various people's organizations, leaders of various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life in the capital attended tonight's meeting.

    首都各界集会支持世界和平理事会科伦坡会议
    谴责美国坚持原子讹诈和扩军备战政策
    拥护苏联裁军建议和缔结停止试验核武器协定的主张
    新华社1日讯　首都各界人民今晚在北京政协礼堂举行支持世界和平理事会科伦坡会议大会。
    大会一致通过的决议，谴责美国政府顽固地拒绝禁止使用和试验核武器，坚持原子讹诈政策和扩军备战政策。决议并且表示，大会一致拥护苏联的裁军建议和要求缔结停止试验核武器国际协定的主张，并且重申中国人民完全支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义的正义斗争！支持阿拉伯人民维护民族独立和主权的正义斗争！支持世界上一切反对战争、争取和平的努力。
      郭沫若讲话
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席、出席世界和平理事会科伦坡会议中国代表团团长郭沫若在今天的大会上首先讲话，他说：世界和平理事会几年来对于动员世界舆论，对于推动和加强各国人民反对战争、保卫和平的斗争作了重大的努力，有了很多贡献。现在正当世界各国人民对和平的要求日益高涨的时候，美国侵略集团却依然在扩军备战，加紧制造紧张局势。因此，全世界爱好和平人民都瞩望和相信，科伦坡会议对消除战争威胁，进一步发展和平事业将作出新的贡献。
    郭沫若说，值得特别指出的是，美国好战分子在亚洲首先是在台湾地区正加紧制造紧张局势。美国好战分子在亚洲和其他地方侵犯着别国的独立主权，扩建原子基地，最近竟公然在我国领土台湾驻扎原子部队，建立导弹基地。侵占台湾的美国好战分子骄横无赖，欺压和残杀台湾同胞。这些行动充分暴露了美国企图借原子威胁阻挠我国人民解放台湾，把台湾视为自己的殖民地。中国人民对美国侵略者的挑衅讹诈和残暴行为，表示无比愤怒，并提出了严重的抗议。台湾是中国的领土，台湾同胞是中国人民，我们决不容忍美国侵略者在我们领土上建立原子基地，杀害我们自己的同胞。我们一定要把美国侵略者赶出台湾。
    郭沫若说，今天反对氢弹试验和原子战争的威胁已成为和平运动的迫切任务之一，将会是这次世界和平理事会的一个重要议程。原子武器有很大的毁灭性，它的后果还要影响人类后代子孙，应该加以禁止，使原子能广泛地利用于和平建设，这是全人类的呼声。我们中国人民完全赞同苏联所提的正义主张，就停止试验氢弹达成协议并早日实现裁军，消除战争威胁。中国人民热烈拥护世界和平理事会今年4月柏林会议号召各国开展反核武器的运动，并且坚决支持当前世界各国，特别是深受原子灾害的日本人民反对原子武器的正义斗争，赞同最近锡兰和印度两国总理联合声明中关于呼吁停止试验核武器的主张。
    郭沫若接着说，世界和平理事会这次在亚洲召开，对于争取和维护民族独立的亚非各国人民，尤其有重大意义。因为保卫和平，特别是保卫亚非地区的和平是与民族独立密切不可分的。我们对亚非和拉丁美洲国家人民的斗争予以全力的支持。我们并且深信，参加这次世界和平理事会的亚非各国人民代表定将在维护亚非地区和平与各国独立主权方面作出新的努力和贡献。
    郭沫若说，总的说来，世界局势对于和平是有利的。尽管帝国主义势力仍在力图煽起国际紧张局势，但世界的总趋势是走向和缓，走向进步。只要世界各国和平力量加强团结，继续发扬万隆精神和日内瓦精神，使一切国际纠纷获得和平解决，大国协商早日实现，毫无疑问，战争威胁是可以消除的，世界持久和平是能够实现的。
    郭沫若最后代表出席科伦坡会议的中国代表团向大会表示，他们一定要把大会和全中国六亿人民保卫世界和平、促进人类进步的意志带到科伦坡会议上去，用最大的努力，和各国代表一起促使会议成功。
        陈叔通讲话
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通接着讲话，他说，我们六亿中国人民一向是世界各国人民反对战争保卫和平的忠实战友，从来就主张通过和平协商，解决国际间的重大问题，缔结和平公约来代替军事集团。早在1951年就有三亿四千万中国人民签名拥护世界和平理事会通过的缔结和平公约的宣言。中国人民是和平共处的五项原则的创始者之一，又是它的忠实执行者。我国政府和我国人民热烈拥护日内瓦精神和万隆精神，并已采取了许多实际步骤，进一步促使国际局势的和缓。
    陈叔通说，我们完全支持世界各国人民反对核武器试验和要求禁止使用这些武器的正义斗争。大家都知道，早在1950年就有二亿五千多万中国人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。1955年又有四亿多人签名拥护世界和平理事会反对使用原子武器的号召。最近，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会又采取了一系列措施，严正表示中国人民坚决支持各国人民要求禁止使用和停止试验核武器的斗争，使原子能为和平建设与人类的幸福生活服务。
    陈叔通说，大家都知道，解放台湾是中国人民的内政问题。美国不但没有把它的武装部队撤出台湾，反而以导弹部队来阻碍我们解放台湾，并残杀台湾同胞。这是中国人民所坚决不能容忍的。我们完全支持我国政府最近所发表的声明，决不畏惧美国侵略者所施展的任何恐吓和威胁，坚决支持台湾同胞的爱国斗争，我们一定要解放台湾；一定要把美国侵略者从台湾赶出去！
    陈叔通说，我们相信，科伦坡会议将为世界和平事业作出新的、巨大的贡献。通过这次会议，凡是有利于和平的主张和建议，中国人民都将给以大力的支持，并且将同各国人民一起为实现这些主张和建议而努力。
      包尔汉讲话
    中国伊斯兰教协会主任、出席世界和平理事会科伦坡会议中国代表团副团长包尔汉讲话说，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，亚非地区长期遭受殖民主义奴役和掠夺的许多民族和国家，已经先后摆脱了殖民主义的桎梏，而成为民族独立的国家。亚非两洲处于殖民统治下的人数已愈来愈少，丑恶的殖民主义势力正日益走向死亡。已经获得解放了的中国人民过去也曾身受过同样的苦难，对于他们不仅有着极其深厚的感情，而且一向同情和支持这些国家的人民为争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的殖民统治而进行的斗争。如大家所共知，两年前举行的具有历史意义的万隆会议，正是反映了亚非十六亿人民的这一共同愿望。
    包尔汉严厉斥责了美帝国主义的侵略政策，他指出，美国不仅在中东扩张侵略，而且还阻挠印度和印度尼西亚解放果阿和西伊里安，力图从经济上和政治上控制拉丁美洲国家，每年在那里掠夺大量利润和资源，同时，还在世界各个地区执行“原子讹诈”政策。
    包尔汉说，我们中国人民将继续坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义，反对艾森豪威尔主义的正义斗争，坚决支持整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界各国人民维护民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争。我们深信，只有遵循和平共处的原则，发扬万隆精神和日内瓦精神，早日实现大国协商，以和平方式解决国际争端，共同保卫和平，消灭殖民主义，才能保证全世界有持久的和平与繁荣。
    包尔汉最后说，让我们中国人民与亚非人民以及全世界爱好和平与自由的人民团结起来为保卫和平，反对战争共同努力。我们一定要把六亿中国人民保卫和平的决心和对世界人民的友好感情带到科伦坡去，使这次和平会议获得光辉成就，为亚洲及全世界和平事业作出巨大贡献。法苏越阿蒙五国和平人士表示和平是我们的共同语言科伦坡会议一定会成功
    接着，出席今晚大会的法国、苏联、越南、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古来宾应郭沫若邀请，相继讲话，他们的讲话受到热烈欢迎。
    世界和平理事会副主席达斯迪埃（法国）讲话说，中国人民在1949年解放了自己的祖国以后，在世界和平运动中同其他国家的人民建立了繁荣的友好合作。中国对和平事业的贡献，对和平运动的贡献，是我们运动中的一个基本因素。他说，今天，我们面临一个历史性的和平行动，这就是世界和平理事会第一次在亚洲，在科伦坡开会。在科伦坡会议前夕，军备竞赛和核武器试验威胁着每一个人。我们的努力，特别是中国人民的努力，是可以消除威胁，并且为缓和局势及和平共处打开新的前景。他最后希望早日在法国的首都——巴黎，接待热爱和平的中国人民的代表团。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员加桑诺瓦（法国）说，中国是个伟大的民族，它对各国的自由作出了伟大的贡献。我们深信，中国人民的贡献对保卫世界和平是有决定性作用的。
    他说，我们到科伦坡去参加会议，目的是在知道怎样更好地为世界和平服务，更好地反对战争势力。法国和平运动过去在反对法国政府在越南战争中起了重要作用，今天，在反对阿尔及利亚战争中又采取了勇敢的和有效的行动。今后对停止原子试验、禁止原子武器也一定要作出同样的努力。
    他又说，我们深信科伦坡会议对大家会发生鼓舞的作用，我们满怀信心地期待着科伦坡会议作出的各种决定，并将予以执行。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、考?楚克（苏联）在会上说，苏联人民多年来一贯坚持不懈地为在全世界停止军备竞赛、禁止核武器、停止试验原子弹和氢弹而斗争。苏联和平拥护者深深地理解为本国的民族独立而斗争的人民的合理愿望，也深深地理解他们为得到决定自己命运的真正权力、不愿外国干涉他们的内政的要求。我完全理解并且热烈支持他们的这种愿望。考?楚克说，在各国人民之间实现持久和平、和平共处和友谊的命运，是掌握在各国人民自己的手里。如果表达了世界人民的愿望，就今天使全人类感到不安的各项重大问题找到共同的语言，那么科伦坡会议将成为具有历史意义的会议。
    出席世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的越南代表团团长、越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探说，我们就要和光荣的中国和平战士一起参加世界和平理事会科伦坡会议，这是一次很重要的会议，同时又是第一次在亚洲地区召开的会议。他深望这次会议能取得辉煌的成就，进一步巩固世界和平力量的团结和行动的一致，以便要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，要求尊重各民族的主权、独立和领土完整，要求裁减军备和取消各个侵略性的军事集团能得到实现；使人类避免无比残酷的原子战争的祸害，从而使发展各民族间的友谊和文化关系的斗争取得胜利。
    出席世界和平理事会的阿尔巴尼亚代表、阿尔巴尼亚全国和平委员会主席什图拉说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民以及一切社会主义国家的人民，都是坚决的和平战士，他们正在建设新的幸福生活。因此，对阿中两国人民和一切爱好和平的人民来说，和平就和水、空气与太阳一样是绝对必需的。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民希望与其他各国人民一起在和平与友谊的环境中生活，他们希望在互利的基础上与其他各国人民建立友好关系和经济文化联系，他们要求扩大日内瓦和万隆会议所开辟的道路，要求永远不再恢复冷战。
    他深信参加科伦坡会议的所有和平力量，一定会作出贡献来进一步巩固和扩大世界和平运动，一定会协力找出新的办法来制止帝国主义者的侵略计划和拯救人类脱离制造浩劫的原子战争的威胁。
    出席世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的蒙古代表团团长采格米拉说，我们深信，几天之后即将召开的世界和平理事会科伦坡会议，定将表达世界人民的愿望，它是保卫和平事业的新的重大步骤，并将鼓舞各国人民保卫和平的强大斗争继续高涨。
    他说，和平的力量正在日益高涨，要求禁止核武器的强大的人民呼声也更加响亮，保卫和平的队伍不断为人类优秀的代表所增强。只要大家共同努力，和平就可以得到保障，各国人民也一定能够实现这个愿望。
    最后，大会一致通过了“中国首都各界人民支持世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的决议”。
    出席今晚大会的有各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人和首都各界人民一千多人。
