　　The U.S. Will Never Succeed in Permanently Occupying Okinawa

    On June 17, the Naha City Council in Okinawa Island passed a vote of no confidence in Naha Mayor Kamejiro Senaga. This is the result of the U.S. military authorities' crude interference in Naha's municipal affairs. The reason the U.S. is acting so recklessly is to suppress the anti-American forces of the Okinawan people, so that it can permanently occupy Okinawa Island as an atomic strategic base.
    On December 26, 1956, the citizens of Naha voted for Kamejiro Senaga as mayor. Senaga is the leader of the Okinawa People's Party. The People's Party has always firmly opposed the U.S. occupation of Okinawan land, opposed the U.S. expansion of atomic bases, and led the people in struggle, always standing at the forefront of the 800,000 residents of Okinawa. Kamejiro Senaga had been imprisoned by the U.S. military for nearly two years and was only released from prison last April. During the election, the U.S. military authorities and local reactionary forces desperately propagandized, saying that "if a Communist mayor is elected, the Okinawa problem will be even more difficult to solve." However, the eyes of the citizens of Naha are bright, and they cast thousands of votes for their beloved person—Kamejiro Senaga.
    Senaga's election as mayor greatly embarrassed the U.S. military authorities. To cover up their shame, the U.S. military authorities publicized that "Senaga's election was due to the tactical disunity of the conservatives, and does not reflect the anti-American sentiment of the people of Naha." However, the people of Okinawa did not believe these absurdities, and anti-American sentiment became even higher. Therefore, the U.S. military authorities immediately forced local banks to freeze the Naha City Government's deposits, obstructing the work of the city government led by Senaga. Democratic Party members of the Naha City Council, instructed by the U.S. military authorities, issued a statement saying: "We cannot cooperate with the People's Party mayor." Under the direction of the U.S. military authorities, civil engineering and construction owners and others also launched a signature campaign against Senaga. At the same time, the U.S. military revised Military Proclamation No. 155, and was to take measures to prohibit all criticism of the U.S. military.
    The crude behavior of the U.S. military authorities in interfering in Naha's municipal affairs aroused public outrage among Okinawan residents and the Japanese people. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held an emergency meeting on December 28 last year and telegraphed the U.S. Far East Commander to protest: "We tell you that Japanese workers protest the unreasonable interference of the United States; we will fight to the end to defend the rights of the Okinawan people." The Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and various people's organizations have all protested to the U.S. authorities. With the support of the people, Naha Mayor Senaga adopted a firm "defend the municipal administration" attitude and obtained the cooperation of the city government staff. On January 28 this year, Naha City held an inauguration celebration for the mayor.
    As the movement for independence by the Japanese people rises, the residents of Okinawa and the Japanese people have shifted from opposing the U.S. interference in Naha's municipal administration to demanding the return of Okinawa by the United States. On February 23, 6,000 representatives from all walks of life in Japan held a national conference in Tokyo demanding the return of administrative power over Okinawa. The conference resolved that Okinawa is Japanese territory, and its residents are all Japanese, so we firmly oppose the U.S. attempt to permanently occupy Okinawa. On April 27, the Okinawa Youth Federation held a rally in Naha City to strive for the early return of administrative power over Okinawa, with about 8,000 people participating. On June 4, four representatives of the Ryukyu Legislature went to Tokyo to petition, requesting the Japanese government to vigorously support local residents in opposing the U.S. seizure of Okinawa Island land to expand military bases.
    In order to consolidate its rule and accelerate the expansion of bases, the U.S. military authorities have recently stepped up instigating local conservative forces in Naha to oppose Senaga and remove him from office. However, the power of the Okinawan and Japanese people is strong. The U.S. aggressors' reckless actions will only arouse greater anger from the Okinawan and Japanese people against them. The U.S. attempt to permanently occupy Okinawa will be met with shameful failure. (Attached picture)

　　美国休想永久霸占冲绳
　　蓝海
    6月17日，冲绳岛首府那霸市议会通过了对那霸市长濑长龟次郎的不信任案。这是美国驻军当局粗暴地干涉那霸市政的结果。美国所以要这样蛮干，其目的是为了打击冲绳人民的反美力量，以便它永久霸占冲绳岛作为原子战略基地。
    1956年12月26日，那霸市民投票选举了濑长龟次郎为市长。濑长是冲绳人民党的领袖。人民党一向坚决反对美国霸占冲绳土地，反对美国扩建原子基地，并领导人民进行斗争，始终站在冲绳八十万居民的最前列。濑长龟次郎曾被美军监禁将近两年，去年4月才被释放出狱。在选举期间，美军当局和当地反动势力拼命进行宣传，说什么“如果选举一个共产党的市长，冲绳问题就更难解决了”。然而，那霸市民的眼睛是明亮的，他们把成千上万的选票投给自己心爱的人——濑长龟次郎。
    濑长当选市长，使美军当局感到极为难堪。为给自己遮丑，美军当局宣传说：“濑长的当选，是由于保守派在战术上不统一的结果，并不是反映那霸市人民的反美情绪”。但是，冲绳人民都不相信这些胡言乱语，反美情绪更为高涨。于是，美军当局立即迫使当地银行冻结那霸市政府的存款，阻挠濑长领导的市政府进行工作。受美军当局指使的那霸市民主党议员发表声明说：“不能同人民党的市长合作”。在美军当局授意之下，土木建筑业主等也发动签名反对濑长。与此同时，美军修改了155号军事通告，要采取措施禁止对美军的一切批评。
    美军当局干涉那霸市政的粗暴行为，激起了冲绳居民和日本人民的公愤。日本工会总评议会在去年12月28日召开紧急会议，打电报给美军远东司令官表示抗议：“我们告诉你们，日本工人抗议美国的无理干涉；我们将为捍卫冲绳人民的权利斗争到底”。日本社会党、共产党和各人民团体，都纷纷向美国当局提出抗议。那霸市长濑长在人民的支持下，采取了坚决“保卫市政”的态度，取得了市政府工作人员的合作。今年1月28日，那霸市举行了市长就任庆祝大会。
    随着日本人民要求独立的运动日益高涨，冲绳居民和日本人民从反对美国干涉那霸市政，转入要求美国归还冲绳的斗争。2月23日，日本各界代表六千人在东京举行了要求归还冲绳的行政权国民大会。大会决议说，冲绳是日本的领土，那里的居民也都是日本人，因此我们坚决反对美国永久侵占冲绳的企图。4月27日，冲绳青年联合会在那霸市举行了争取早日交还冲绳行政权大会，约有八千人参加。6月4日，琉球立法院的四个代表到东京请愿，要求日本政府大力支援当地居民，反对美国强占冲绳岛土地来扩充军事基地。
    美军当局为了巩固它的统治，加速扩充基地，最近更加紧唆使那霸的地方保守势力反对濑长，要赶他下台。但是，冲绳和日本人民的力量是强大的，美国侵略者这样蛮干，只会激起冲绳和日本人民对它的更大忿怒。美国永久霸占冲绳的企图将会遭到可耻失败。（附图片）
