    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, sent a telegram to overseas Chinese in South Vietnam today, expressing, on behalf of the Chinese government, deep concern for the overseas Chinese who have become unemployed as a result of the South Vietnamese government's ban on overseas Chinese engaging in eleven types of businesses.
    In the telegram, He Xiangning also expressed the hope that overseas Chinese would strengthen their unity, display the spirit of solidarity, and strive to safeguard their legitimate rights and solve their own difficulties.
    The Chinese People's Relief Association today also remitted 30,000 yuan in RMB to provide relief to overseas Chinese who have become unemployed due to the aforementioned situation.
    The South Vietnamese government promulgated a decree on September 6th of last year, prohibiting foreigners in South Vietnam from engaging in eleven types of businesses, including grain, cloth, and groceries. According to estimates in South Vietnamese Chinese newspapers, if all eleven types of businesses cease operation, at least 200,000 overseas Chinese will lose their jobs.

    何香凝电慰南越失业华侨
    救济总会汇去救济款三万元
    新华社4日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会主任何香凝今天打电报给南越侨胞，代表我国政府对因南越政府禁止华侨经营十一种行业而告失业的侨胞深表关怀。
    何香凝在电报中还希望侨胞们能够加强团结，发挥同舟共济的精神，为维护自己的正当权益和解决本身的困难而努力。
    中国人民救济总会今天也汇款人民币三万元救济由于上述情况而失业的侨胞。
    南越政府在去年9月6日颁布了一项法令，禁止在南越境内的外侨经营包括粮食、布匹、杂货等十一种行业。据南越中文报纸估计，如果十一种行业全部停止经营后，失业的华侨至少有二十万人。
