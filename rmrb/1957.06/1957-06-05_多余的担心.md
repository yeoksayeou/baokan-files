	Unnecessary Worry
	Recently, the newspapers have been filled with reports exposing internal contradictions. Some well-intentioned people believe that the contradictions between the democratic parties and the Communist Party have become acute and are on the verge of being unmanageable. At the very least, they feel the exposure of these contradictions is detrimental to the people's cause and will be exploited by the enemy. In fact, this worry is unnecessary.
	Exposing internal contradictions is precisely for the purpose of resolving them. The less we avoid talking about sensitive issues, the less sensitive the issues will become, and the easier the contradictions will be to resolve. No matter how the enemy tries to exploit loopholes, it will be a waste of effort.
	Facts have proven and will continue to prove that seriously addressing internal contradictions is beneficial to strengthening unity and consolidating strength. As long as we correct our mistakes, seriously address our own errors, the enemy can only stare blankly.

    多余的担心
    由于近来报上连篇累牍揭露内部矛盾，有些好心人，认为各民主党派同共产党的矛盾已尖锐化，大有不可收拾之概，至少这些矛盾的揭露是于人民的事业不利，是会被敌人利用的云云。其实这担心是多余的。
    揭露内部矛盾，正是为了解决矛盾。越是不避免谈尖锐的问题，问题越不会尖锐化，矛盾也就越容易得到解决。任敌人怎样钻空子也是枉费心机。
    事实已经证明并将继续证明，严肃地对待内部矛盾，对于加强团结、巩固力量有好处。只要我们有过必改，严肃对待自己的错误，敌人是只能干瞪眼的。
