    Forest Elementary School

    This is my third time coming to the forest.

    I have many worker friends in the forest. The logging camp moves frequently, and each time I have to spend a lot of effort to find their location. Everyone is very happy to see each other again. Their personalities are so bold that sometimes they even use a few punches to the chest to express their friendship towards me.

    The forest has changed a lot. A few years ago, when the tasks were tight, people worked day and night. Their eyes were bloodshot, their voices were hoarse, and they easily got angry. Now? When the tasks are tight, they still work day and night, but they do it in shifts with electric lights. There is rest on Sundays. The canteen has an attached small shop. Comrades, don't think that the small shop selling cigarettes and sweets is a common thing. You have to consider that this is in a large forest, a place that takes days and nights to reach. In the past, we always ate beans, bean curd soup, bean curd jelly, fried bean curd, pan-fried bean curd, boiled bean curd, braised bean curd... Now, whatever the mountain has, this place has. It's not rare anymore.

    In the past, people were irritable because they were worried, missing their homes, missing their wives and children outside the mountains. The young ones were worried that if they continued to work like this, when would they be able to find a wife?

    Now they are not afraid. Wherever the logging camp goes, their wives and children follow. Family houses are built wherever they go. What about those without wives? Because there are more families, there are also more matchmakers, so the problem is not so big.

    Now the trouble is the children's education problem.

    Watching the children grow up day by day. No one takes care of them, and they run around in the forest all day long, like little wild bears.

    The workers have opinions:

    "Okay! Okay! We 'old blinds' have been swept away, and 'little blinds' have emerged!"

    Forest logging work is very special. It is highly mobile, moving once every one or two years or several years. It is also scattered, sometimes with many people and sometimes with few. How can schools be built in such a situation? It is also far from the city. How can children who are four or five years old be sent to study hundreds of miles away?

    Children are important. Some workers have returned to their hometowns to farm because their children cannot get an education.

    I remember when I came to the forest last year, I met a child running around barefoot in the forest. He was eleven or twelve years old, knew how to play, knew how to talk and laugh, but couldn't read. His father wanted him to take a train to a place hundreds of miles away to study. He took money with him, but in a few days, he spent all the money and returned home naked. The father was so angry that he beat him severely, then gave him some more money. Again, he spent all the money and returned home naked. This year I did not see this father and son. I heard that they have already returned to their hometown to engage in agricultural production...

    However, this problem was solved smoothly this year, and it was done very well.

    Looking out from my window, the small wooden house facing south that was originally used as a bathroom is now the elementary school of the forest logging camp. From inside, the sounds of reading and singing are constantly heard. At noon, the children line up and come out of the house, like little ducks, heading to the family dormitory to eat lunch.

    There is no problem with money for running an elementary school in the forest. But no one knew how to do it. There were no teachers, the scale was small, and there were few students. Nothing could be accomplished. Such a school format had never been seen before, and there was no advanced experience to learn from. Running this kind of school cannot follow the rules of running a school. Building school buildings, hiring teachers, buying school equipment, etc., are useless. The number of students is uncertain, sometimes three, sometimes eleven...

    According to the characteristics of the forest logging team, a solution was finally found.

    "Don't think about building school buildings, buying teaching equipment, or hiring teachers first! Find a place and start classes first!" The leading comrades here said this. After saying it, they did it, and things were accomplished.

    Books were requested from a "big and small school" outside the forest. What about the teacher? It was a little troublesome, but then we remembered that there were family members who had graduated from elementary school. Wasn't that great?

    How the teacher taught her in the past, she now teaches the children the same way. She teaches in the morning and still takes care of household chores in the afternoon. The children like her very much, and the parents also feel that she is very competent to teach their children to read.

    I have never seen such a simple and courageous school. There isn't even a bell for class beginning or ending. "Okay! Class is over!" The teacher always says this and then dismisses class.

    What does it matter! The important thing is that the school has been established. (Attached picture)

    森林小学
    黄永玉
    我是第三次来到森林了。
    在森林里我有许多工人朋友。采伐场常搬家，我每次都得费好大劲才找得到他们的场子。大家重新见面是非常高兴的，他们的性格是那样的豪放，有时甚至不能不用当胸几拳来表示他们对我的友谊。
    森林的变化很大。前几年，任务紧的时候，白天晚上地干，人们的眼睛充满血丝，嗓子沙哑，动不动就光火生气。现在呢？任务紧的时候也是白天黑夜地干，但却是开着电灯轮着早晚班干的。星期天有休息。食堂附设小卖部。同志们，别以为小卖部卖香烟糖果是平常事，你得考虑这是在大森林里，走几天几夜才到得了的地方。过去吃饭，老是豆子、豆腐汤、豆腐花、炒豆腐、煎豆腐、煮豆腐、焖豆腐……现在呢，山上有甚么，这儿就有甚么。不希罕了。
    过去，人们脾气躁是有心事，想家，想山外的老婆孩子。年青的就担心这样干下去，几时才讨得了老婆？
    现在不怕了，伐木场到哪里，老婆孩子就跟到哪里，哪里也就盖上家属房子。没有老婆的呢？因为家属一多，媒人也就多了，问题也不大了。
    现在麻烦的是孩子们读书的问题。
    看着孩子一天天长大起来了。没人管教，成天在林子里跑来跑去，像个小野熊似的。
    工人们有意见了：
    “好啦！好啦！我们这些‘老盲’扫掉了，‘小盲’又出来了！”
    森林采伐工作很特殊，流动性大，一两年或几年搬一次家；又分得散，有时人多有时人少，这样情况怎样建得校舍？离开城市又远，四、五岁大的孩子，怎么能送到百里外去念书？
    孩子是重要的，有的是因为孩子念不到书回乡种庄稼去的工人。
    记得去年我上森林来的时候，就碰见一个赤着脚在林子里跑来跑去的孩子，十一、二岁了，会玩，会说会笑，就是认不得字，他父亲要他搭火车上百里外的地方去念书，带了钱，过不几天，花完钱光着身子回家来了。做父亲的气得狠狠地揍了一顿，又给了一些钱，又是花完了钱光着身子回来。今年我没有见到这对父子，听说已经回乡生产去了……
    但是，这个问题今年顺利地解决了，并且弄得非常之好。
    从我的窗口望出去，朝南的那间原来做浴室的小木屋，现在是森林伐木场的小学校了。从里头不时传出读书和唱歌的声音。中午，孩子们排着队从屋里出来，小鸭子似地，回家属宿舍那边吃午饭去。
    在森林里办小学，钱没有问题。但不知道该怎么办？没有老师，规模又小，学生少，弄不出个名堂。像这样形式的学校还从没有见过，也没有先进经验可学。办这种学校不能按照办学校的规矩的，建校舍，请教员，买校具甚么的，这都没啥用处；学生人数又不一定，有时是三个，有时又是十一个。……
    根据森林采伐队的特点，办法到底给想出来了。
    “先别想建校舍，买教具请教员吧！找个地方先上课再说！”这儿的领导同志这么说，说完就干，事情也就成了。
    书是从森林外的一间“大小学”里要的，先生呢！麻烦了一下，后来才想起家属中有念到小学毕业的人，这不就好极了吗？
    过去先生怎么教她，现在她就怎么教好孩子，她上午上课，下午仍然管家务事，孩子们很喜欢她，家长们也觉得由她来教导孩子们读书是很能胜任的。
    我从来没有见过这样朴素这样有勇气的学校，连个上下课铃噹也没有，“好！下课啦！”老师总是这么说完就下课。
    这有甚么关系呢！重要的是学校办起来了。（附图片）
