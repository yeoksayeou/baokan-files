　　“Achievements are fundamental…”
　　Fan Bing
    "Achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings are secondary." It is said that many people have a strong aversion to this statement. Why the aversion? It is said that this statement is a form of dogmatism.

    Some say the reason for the aversion is that they are "tired of hearing it." This sentence is indeed heard a lot. However, the question remains whether the statement is correct. Is this statement correct or not? In terms of the entire work of the country and the Party, is it true that "achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings and errors are secondary"? The answer should be yes. Otherwise, how can we explain the great achievements we have made in revolution and construction? Of course, saying this does not mean that every region, every unit, and every task is like this. But one cannot draw the conclusion that "the achievements of the entire national work are fundamental, and shortcomings are secondary," while for every region, every unit, and every task, it is "achievements are secondary, and shortcomings and errors are fundamental." Therefore, the problem lies in specific analysis.

    If one summarizes a task without any analysis, and reflexively says "achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings are secondary," this is of course a form of dogmatism, and one should "have a strong aversion" to it. If the summary is based on concrete analysis, and the conclusion is indeed so (and of course, one must point out the extent of "fundamental" and "secondary"), then one should no longer regard it as dogmatism, and should not "have a strong aversion" to it. If, regardless of the facts, without the slightest analysis, one reflexively associates "achievements are fundamental…" with dogmatism, and "has a strong aversion" to it, I am afraid this attitude cannot be considered "seeking truth from facts," right? I am afraid it would be hard to prevent others from "having a strong aversion" to your "aversion" as well.

    Of course, even if "achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings are secondary" reflects the true situation of the work, if someone becomes arrogant and complacent because of it, feeling that since "achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings are secondary," there is no need to work hard to overcome the shortcomings, one should also feel aversion to this attitude. But if people are not like this, but after inspecting and summarizing the work, have the confidence and determination to overcome shortcomings and further improve the work, then why should one still "have a strong aversion" to them? Is it only when one sees that "achievements are secondary, and shortcomings and errors are fundamental," only when one sees people lose confidence in improving the work, that one feels happy?

### “成绩是基本的……”

　　“成绩是基本的……”

    “成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的。”据说不少的人对这种讲法颇有反感。为什么会有反感，据说这种讲法是一种教条主义。
    引起反感的原因，有的人说是“听腻了”。这句话确是听得很多了。但是，问题还在于话说得对不对。究竟这种讲法对不对呢？就全国、全党的整个工作来说，是不是“成绩是基本的，缺点、错误是次要的”呢？回答应该是肯定的。否则，又怎能解释我们所取得的革命和建设的伟大成就呢？当然，这样来讲，并不等于说每一地区、每一单位、每一件工作也都是这样。但确也不能得出这样的结论，说“全国整个工作成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的”，而每一地区、每一单位、每一件工作则是“成绩是次要的，缺点、错误是基本的”。所以，问题还是在于具体分析。
    如果总结一件工作时，丝毫不加分析，像条件反射似地一下子就说“成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的”，这当然是一种教条主义，应当对它“颇有反感”。如果总结经过了具体分析，结论确实如此（当然还要指出“基本”、“次要”到什么程度），那就不能再把它看作教条主义，就不应对它“颇有反感”了。如果不管事实怎样，不加丝毫分析，也像条件反射似地一听说“成绩是基本的……”，就联想到教条主义，就“颇有反感”起来，恐怕这种态度是不能算“实事求是”的吧。恐怕也很难保别人不对你这种“反感”也“颇有反感”吧。
    当然，即使“成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的”，反映了工作的真实情况，如果有人因此就骄傲自满起来，感到既然“成绩是基本的，缺点是次要的”，而缺点也就用不着再努力去克服了，对这种态度，也应起到反感。但如果人家不是这样，而是在检查和总结了工作以后，有信心、有决心去克服缺点，进一步地改进工作，那为什么还要对人家“颇有反感”呢？难道非看到“成绩是次要的，缺点、错误是基本的”，非看到人家对改进工作失去信心才心身愉快吗？
