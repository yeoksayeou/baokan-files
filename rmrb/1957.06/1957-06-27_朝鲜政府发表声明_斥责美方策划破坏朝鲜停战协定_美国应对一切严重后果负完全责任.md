Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement denouncing the new U.S. actions to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement played a significant role in easing the long-standing international tensions. The people of all countries welcomed the realization of the Korean armistice and hoped that the armistice agreement would be strictly observed, further transforming the armistice into a solid peace.

    However, due to the continuous schemes by the U.S. ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the armistice, these heartfelt wishes of the people have not been realized.

    Recently, the U.S. ruling clique has been carrying out a series of improper schemes to once again undermine the armistice agreement in order to transport new types of weapons into South Korea.

    The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on May 30th, protesting against these improper schemes by the U.S. and clarifying the position of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on this issue. However, disregarding these, the U.S. announced on June 21st, through a statement by the Military Armistice Commission, that it would unilaterally abandon compliance with Sub-paragraph D of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement.

    The new U.S. act of undermining the armistice agreement runs counter to the wishes of peace-loving people around the world for comprehensive disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Its result will further exacerbate tensions in Korea and the Far East. Contrary to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, this will trigger an arms race in Korea and create the danger of the resumption of war.

    The U.S. aggressive bloc is once again creating provocative actions in Korea, which is by no means accidental. Events in international life since the Korean armistice have shown that the U.S.'s aggressive foreign policy - the "policy of strength" - has suffered severe failures everywhere in the world. In order to salvage its declining prestige, the U.S. aggressive bloc is once again escalating tensions, preparing for a new atomic war, and directly threatening the people.

    The U.S. ruling clique's attempt to move the United Nations Command from Tokyo to Seoul, while simultaneously undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement by transporting new types of weapons into South Korea, is an organic link in the overall plan of the U.S. imperialists to launch an aggressive atomic war.

    Disregarding the strong demands of all Korean people today for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the U.S. is not only failing to withdraw its troops but is also attempting to perpetuate the U.S. occupation of South Korea, prolong the division of Korea, transform South Korea into a permanent U.S. colony, and turn South Korea into an outpost for the U.S. ruling clique to pursue its sinister atomic war.

    The U.S. schemes to undermine the armistice agreement did not begin today. A series of events that have occurred in South Korea over the past four years since the armistice prove that, from the very beginning, the U.S. ruling clique, in collusion with the Syngman Rhee clique, has been frantically attempting to undermine the armistice agreement.

    The U.S. violated the agreement between both sides on the repatriation of prisoners of war, forcibly detained more than 48,000 prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese sides, and forcibly detained many peaceful residents abducted by the U.S. military from the northern half, obstructing their return to their homes.

    Shortly after the armistice was realized, the U.S. government concluded the "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee clique, creating a pretext aimed at legalizing the long-term occupation of South Korea by U.S. troops even after the armistice.

    The U.S. military has also disregarded the armistice agreement, greatly expanding all the armed forces of South Korea, including the army, navy, and air force, and illegally transporting in large quantities of various weapons, equipping them as modernized units. Not only that, but the U.S. has also constantly violated the military demarcation line and continued to conduct espionage, sabotage, and assassination activities against North Korea.

    The U.S.'s acts of undermining the armistice agreement are not limited to these. They have also directed Syngman Rhee to create various vicious, provocative harassment activities aimed at undermining the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, even threatening the lives of members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and finally, in June 1956, unilaterally prevented inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from carrying out legitimate activities in South Korea.

    The U.S. continues to conduct its provocative harassment activities, and recently has rampantly spread various lies slandering the Korean and Chinese sides in order to illegally transport new types of weapons into South Korea. However, all the fabricated lies put forward by the U.S. today are nothing more than old-fashioned propaganda manufactured to deceive public opinion around the world.

    The continued actions of the U.S. ruling clique to undermine the armistice agreement clearly demonstrate that they are unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    After the armistice, the U.S. not only undermined the preliminary talks between both sides for convening a political conference, but also did its utmost to obstruct the possibility of reaching any agreement at the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue, causing the conference to break down.

    The U.S. ruling clique is stubbornly implementing a colonial policy aimed at enslaving South Korea, strengthening the plundering of South Korea's economy, encouraging U.S. capitalists to invest in South Korea, and strengthening the military and police terror regime in South Korea in order to suppress the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people against U.S. imperialist aggression, even depriving the people of the slightest democratic rights. They even manufactured the barbaric atrocity of mobilizing U.S. military police units to collectively attack and plunder peaceful villages in broad daylight.

    Thus, today, South Korea under the occupation of U.S. troops has become a uniquely dark land in the world, with social tragedies such as hunger, poverty, depravity, and crime rapidly increasing. This is the result of the U.S. ruling clique's implementation of a colonial enslavement policy in South Korea.

    In sharp contrast to the U.S., the Korean and Chinese sides have made and continue to make every effort to strictly observe the armistice agreement and transform the Korean armistice into a solid peace.

    In order to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed restoring contact and economic and cultural exchanges between the North and South, and in order to ease tensions and eliminate mutual distrust between the North and South, has proposed abandoning the mutual use of force, and at the same time, has reduced 80,000 military personnel and corresponding military equipment from the Korean People's Army, and has proposed convening talks on arms reduction between the North and South.

    All these sincere efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been warmly supported by the entire Korean people and peace-loving people around the world. However, the U.S. ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee clique, which were originally opposed to the peaceful reunification of Korea, have rejected all these proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and have been frantically preparing to provoke a new war in Korea.

    At present, the most urgent and primary issue in Korea is to withdraw all foreign troops from the entire Korean region, transform the armistice into a solid peace, reduce the military forces of North and South Korea to a minimum, and ease tensions in Korea, in order to rapidly create the possibility for the Korean people to peacefully reunify their divided fatherland on a democratic basis. In order to realize this just cause, it is first necessary to prevent the resumption of the Korean War and maintain a solid peace internationally.

    From this point of view, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea emphasizes that it is necessary to eliminate the current obstacles formed by the U.S.'s preparations for a new war. In order to promote the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, ensure a solid peace, and promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it is necessary to promptly convene an international conference with the broad participation of relevant countries, and continue to strive to achieve economic and cultural exchanges and other contacts and consultations between North and South Korea, in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    Today, the U.S. is not only failing to withdraw its troops from South Korea but is also attempting to move the United Nations Command to Seoul and undermine the armistice agreement by transporting new types of weapons into South Korea. These schemes are absolutely intolerable, and no provocative schemes of the U.S. aggressive bloc can intimidate the Korean people.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly opposes and rejects the U.S.'s improper schemes, aimed at preparing for a new Korean war, to unilaterally abandon compliance with Sub-paragraph D of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement in order to freely transport new types of weapons into South Korea. Under no circumstances is the unilateral modification or abolition of the armistice agreement permissible. If the U.S. disregards the armistice agreement and dares to transport new types of weapons into South Korea, then the U.S. government will bear full responsibility for all its serious consequences.

　　朝鲜政府发表声明
    斥责美方策划破坏朝鲜停战协定  美国应对一切严重后果负完全责任
    新华社平壤26日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，斥责美方破坏朝鲜停战协定的新行为。声明全文如下：
    朝鲜停战协定的缔结，对缓和长期持续的国际紧张局势起了不小的作用。所有国家的人民都欢迎朝鲜停战的实现，并且希望停战协定得到严格的遵守，进一步把停战转变为巩固的和平。
    但是，由于美国统治集团和李承晚集团连续进行破坏停战的策动，人民的这一切身愿望没有能够实现。
    最近时期，美国统治集团为了再一次破坏停战协定以便把新型武器运入南朝鲜，又进行了一系列的不正当的策划。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相曾经在5月30日发表声明，对于美方的这种不正当的策划表示抗议，阐明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于这个问题的立场。然而美方不顾这些，6月21日通过军事停战委员会声明它将片面废弃对停战协定第十三款卯项的遵守。
    美方对停战协定的新的破坏行为，是违背全世界爱好和平的人民关于全面裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的愿望的，它的结果将进一步加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势，同停战协定的各项规定相反，这将在朝鲜引起军备竞赛和造成战争重起的危险。
    美国侵略集团在朝鲜又一次制造挑衅行动，这决不是偶然的。朝鲜停战实现后，在国际生活中发生的事件显示出：美国的侵略性的对外政策——“实力政策”，在世界各处遭到了严重的失败。美国侵略集团为了挽救自己威信的低落，就再一次加剧紧张局势，准备新的原子战争，直接威胁着人民。
    美国统治集团企图把联合国军司令部从东京移到汉城，同时破坏朝鲜停战协定把新型武器运入南朝鲜，这一系列的骚扰活动，就是美帝国主义者为了实现发动侵略性的原子战争的全面计划的一个有机环节。
    美方不顾今天全体朝鲜人民强硬要求美军撤退的情况，不仅不撤出它的军队，却企图把美军对南朝鲜的强占永久化起来，使朝鲜的分裂情况长期化，把南朝鲜变为美国永久的殖民地，把南朝鲜变为美国统治集团谋求罪恶的原子战争的前哨基地。
    美方破坏停战协定的策动并不是从今天才开始的。停战四年来，在南朝鲜所发生的一系列的事件证明：从一开始，美国统治集团就同李承晚集团相互勾结起来，疯狂地企图破坏停战协定。
    美方破坏双方关于遣返战俘的协议，强迫扣留了朝中方面的战俘四万八千多名，并且强迫扣留了美军从北半部掳走的许多和平居民，阻挠他们返回自己的家乡。
    停战实现不久，美国政府同李承晚集团缔结了“韩美共同防御条约”，以制造目的在于使美军在停战后仍然长期强占南朝鲜并把它合法化的借口。
    美军还漠视停战协定，大大扩充包括陆、海、空军在内的南朝鲜的一切武装力量，并且非法运入大量的各种武器，把它们武装成现代化的部队。不仅如此，美方还不断侵犯军事分界线，并且继续对北朝鲜进行间谍、破坏和暗害工作。
    美方破坏停战协定的行为不只是这一些，他们还指使李承晚制造了各种目的在于破坏中立国监察委员会活动的毒辣的挑衅性的骚扰活动，甚至于威胁到中立国监察委员会成员的性命，并且终于在1956年6月片面阻止中立国监察委员会视察小组在南朝鲜的合法活动。
    美方继续进行它的这种挑衅性的骚扰活动，最近又狂妄地散布各种诽谤朝中方面的谎言，以便把新型武器非法运入南朝鲜。但是，今天美方所提出的一切捏造出来的谎言，不过是为了欺骗全世界的社会舆论而制造的老一套的宣传而已。
    美方统治集团继续破坏停战协定的行为，明显地证明他们是不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的。
    美方在停战后，不仅破坏双方为了召开政治会议的预备会谈，而且在关于朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议上也竭力阻挠达成任何协议的可能性，致使会议破裂。
    美国统治集团一味实行企图奴役南朝鲜的殖民地政策，加强对南朝鲜经济的掠夺，鼓励美国资本家对南朝鲜投资，同时为了镇压南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的爱国斗争，加强了南朝鲜的军事和警察恐怖统治制度，连人民的一点点民主权利都被剥夺了。他们甚至制造出在白天动员美国宪兵部队集体袭击和掠夺和平村庄的野蛮暴行。
    这样，今天在美军强占下的南朝鲜就成了世界上独一无二的黑暗的土地，饥饿、贫穷、堕落和犯罪等社会性的悲剧正在迅速地增加着。这就是美国统治集团在南朝鲜实行殖民地奴役政策的结果。
    同美方正相反，朝中方面为了严格遵守停战协定和将朝鲜停战转为巩固的和平作了并且继续作着一切努力。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了促进祖国的和平统一，曾经屡次建议恢复南北间的接触和经济文化的交流，并且为了缓和南北间的紧张局势和消除相互之间的不信任，建议放弃互相使用武力，同时从朝鲜人民军中裁减了八万军事人员和相应的军事装备，并且建议召开南北裁减军备的会谈。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一切真诚的努力，受到了全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。但是，原来就反对朝鲜和平统一的美国统治集团和李承晚集团拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一切的建议，疯狂地在朝鲜作挑起新战争的准备。
    目前，朝鲜最迫切的和首要的问题是从全朝鲜地区撤出一切外国军队，将停战转为巩固和平，把南北朝鲜的武力削减到最低限度，缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，以迅速造成由朝鲜人民在民主的基础上和平统一分裂了的祖国的可能性。为了实现这个正当的事业，首先要防止朝鲜战争的重起，在国际上保持巩固的和平。
    从这一点出发，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府强调：必须消除由于美方准备新战争而形成的目前的障碍。为了促使外国军队撤离朝鲜，保证巩固和平和促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，必须迅速召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议，并且继续努力实现南北朝鲜间的经济文化交流以及其他接触和协商，以促进朝鲜的和平统一。
    今天美方在南朝鲜不仅不撤退自己的军队，反而企图把联合国军司令部移到汉城，并且破坏停战协定，把新型武器运入南朝鲜，这些策动是决不能容许的，美国侵略集团的任何挑衅策划也恐吓不了朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决反对和排斥美方以准备新的朝鲜战争为目的，片面废弃对停战协定第十三款卯项的遵守，以便向南朝鲜随便运入新型武器的不正当的策划。不管在任何情况下，对停战协定的片面修改或废除都是不能容许的。如果美方无视停战协定，胆敢把新型武器运入南朝鲜，那么，美国政府将对它的一切严重的后果负完全的责任。
