Xinhua News Agency special dispatch by Xinhua reporter Wang Kongcheng: "The leadership of the Central Academy of Fine Arts is rejecting traditional Chinese painting." Chen Banding, Xu Yansun, and four other traditional Chinese painters, along with traditional Chinese painters and enthusiasts in Beijing, reiterated this view at a symposium held on June 2nd. They believe that the defense made by certain painters from the Central Academy of Fine Arts at a symposium held in late May regarding the academy was tinged with sectarianism.

Many traditional Chinese painters believe that Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, was correct in criticizing the Central Academy of Fine Arts and its president, Jiang Feng, for belittling traditional Chinese painting. Traditional Chinese painter Li Zhichao said that Vice Minister Qian's opinion reflected the voices of traditional Chinese painters over the past eight years since liberation and supported the truth. Traditional Chinese painters further elaborated on the basis for Qian Junrui's criticism of the Central Academy of Fine Arts' leadership for rejecting traditional Chinese painting. Traditional Chinese painter Qin Zhongwen said that the Central Academy of Fine Arts is an institution of higher learning for cultivating artistic talent, but it does not have a traditional Chinese painting department; the colored ink painting department in the academy is not equivalent to traditional Chinese painting. Chinese painting is not just about color and ink; it mainly includes traditional techniques such as refined brushwork, subtle ink variations, poetic expression, and capturing the spirit while overlooking the appearance. I am not opposed to learning sketching, but the academy emphasizes it while neglecting copying, which is wrong because the traditional techniques of Chinese painting are mainly acquired through copying. Traditional Chinese painter Wu Huansun said that sketching is important to learn because it can help master form. However, sketching is not a panacea; it cannot encompass the traditional techniques of Chinese painting. The academy does not teach the brushstrokes of Chinese painting, such as lines, texture strokes, dots, and ink techniques such as dry ink, wet ink, lively ink, burnt ink, as well as the characteristics of techniques such as combining strength and gentleness, spacing density, using dryness and wetness interchangeably, and generating shades of ink, because the academy emphasizes sketching. I have seen the art exhibitions of the professors and the students' works from the colored ink painting department and these traditional techniques are very rarely reflected. I raised these issues with the academy leadership, but they ignored me. Some of the people trusted by the academy leadership do not understand much about traditional Chinese painting, and some even treat traditional Chinese painting with nihilism. Huang Yun, a traditional Chinese painter who is a lecturer in the colored ink painting department of the academy, said that in the academy we have the title but no power, we are not notified of many things, and we are often mistreated. Jiang Feng belittles traditional Chinese painting, and he emphasizes that there are few teachers and the organization is not sound, so the teaching hours for Chinese painting are arranged much less than those for oil painting. Traditional Chinese painter Yu Feian said that the Central Academy of Fine Arts should not only value colored ink painting and let one flower bloom alone, but should develop all genres of painting. Traditional Chinese painter Zhou Huaimin said that his daughter also studies traditional Chinese painting at the academy, but she has no knowledge of traditional Chinese painting at all.

The traditional Chinese painters expressed their opinions on the speeches made by certain painters from the Central Academy of Fine Arts at a symposium held in late May. Wu Huansun said that when they defended Jiang Feng, their views on the problems were not comprehensive, making people feel that there was still sectarianism at play. As a result, the walls have become higher instead of being torn down, and the ditches have become deeper instead of being filled. Traditional Chinese painter Tian Shiguang said, even President Jiang Feng himself admitted that he treated traditional Chinese painting with sectarianism, so why do others still defend him? Wang Guotang, a member of the Chinese Painting Research Association, said that the people who defended Jiang Feng said that Jiang Feng valued New Year pictures, but New Year pictures cannot replace traditional Chinese painting, nor are they equivalent to traditional Chinese painting. Yang Renkai, from the Northeast Museum, said, "I think the comrades in the academy should more humbly examine themselves and emphasize both 'foreign' and 'local'." Huang Yun disagreed with some artists who believed that the traditional Chinese painters' criticism of the academy was a matter of personnel arrangements, and he believed that this was a defense for Jiang Feng.

Some traditional Chinese painters at the meeting also hoped that newspapers and periodicals would open their doors to them and publish more works by traditional Chinese painters.

### 北京国画家举行座谈会  认为中央美术学院领导上是排斥国画的

    北京国画家举行座谈会
    认为中央美术学院领导上是排斥国画的
    本报特约新华社专稿　新华社记者王孔诚报道：“中央美术学院领导上是排斥国画的。”陈半丁、徐燕荪等六位国画家召集的北京市的国画家和国画爱好者，在2日举行的座谈会上再一次申述了自己的这种看法。他们认为中央美术学院的某些画家们在上月下旬举行的座谈会上对学院所作的辩护是带有宗派主义情绪的。
    很多国画家都认为文化部副部长钱俊瑞对中央美术学院和这个学院的院长江丰提出的轻视国画的批评是正确的。国画家李智超说，钱副部长的意见是反映了解放后八年来国画家的呼声，支持了真理。国画家们还进一步阐述了钱俊瑞批评中央美术学院领导排斥国画的根据。国画家秦仲文说，中央美术学院是一个培养艺术人才的高等学府，可是没有国画系；学院中的彩墨画系并不等于国画，中国画不光是彩和墨，它主要地还包括有笔精墨妙，诗情画意、遗貌取神等传统技法。学素描我是不反对的，可是学院强调它而忽略了临摹就错了。因为中国画的传统技法主要是靠临摹得来的。国画家吴幻荪谈，由于素描能掌握形象，所以是要学的。可是素描不是万能的，它不能包括中国画的传统技法。中国画的笔法如线、皴、点，墨法如燥墨法、湿墨法、活墨法、焦墨法，以及刚柔相济、疏密相间、燥湿互用、浓淡相生等技法特色，学院由于强调了素描，就不教这些。我看过学院彩墨画系教授们的画展，和学生们的习作，里边这些传统的技法体现得非常少。我就这些问题曾给学院领导上提意见，可是领导上就不理。学院领导上信任的一些人对国画的知识都是不太懂的，甚至有的对待国画是虚无主义者。在学院彩墨画系作讲师的国画家黄筠说，在学院中我们是有职无权，许多事情都不通知我们，并且还受气。江丰是轻视国画的，他强调教员少，组织不健全，所以关于中国画教学上的钟点比起油画来安排的相当少。国画家于非暗说，中央美术学院不应当只重视彩墨画，一花独放，而应该发展各个画种。国画家周怀民说，他的女儿也在学院学国画，但她的国画知识一点也没有。
    国画家们对中央美术学院某些画家们在上月下旬举行的座谈会上的发言提出了意见。吴幻荪说，他们在为江丰辩护时，对问题的看法不全面，使人感到还有宗派主义在作祟。结果形成墙未拆而愈高，沟未填而愈深。国画家田世光说，江丰院长自己都承认对待国画有宗派主义，可是别人为什么还要替他辩护呢？中国画研究会会员汪国堂说，替江丰辩护的人说江丰重视年画，但年画不能代替国画，也不等于国画。来自东北博物馆的杨仁恺说，我觉得学院的同志更应当虚心地检查自己，“洋”“土”并重。黄筠不同意有的美术家把国画家对学院的批评认为是属于国画家人事上的安排问题，他认为这是替江丰辩护。
    会上有些国画家还希望报刊上为他们打开门，多登一些国画家的作品。
