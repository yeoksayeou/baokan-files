Several Problems in the Economic Relationship Between Japan and the United States
　　Zhuang Tao
    Japan was originally a military and feudal imperialist country. Since its unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers on August 15, 1945, it has been under the complete occupation of American imperialism and has lost its independence. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed by the United States, Britain, and other countries with Japan, came into effect in April 1952, Japan changed from a state of complete occupation to a semi-occupied country, achieving formal independence. In recent years, due to the rapid recovery and development of the Japanese economy, the tendency of the Japanese bourgeoisie to break away from American control economically and take an independent path of development has become increasingly obvious. In this regard, although the United States still wants to use various methods to strengthen its control over the Japanese economy, this trend of Japan seeking independent development is difficult to stop. One of the purposes of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States is to seek to alleviate some of the contradictions that exist in the current economic relationship between Japan and the United States, in order to facilitate the development of the Japanese economy in a more independent direction.
    U.S. Interference in Japan's Finances
    Before the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, Japan's finances and even its entire economic life were under American control. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, the situation changed, and the occupation institutions were abolished. However, the United States still interferes with the compilation of Japan's budget every year through "defense burden sharing fees." The "defense burden sharing fee" is the fee that Japan pays to the U.S. forces stationed in Japan every year, included in the direct military expenditure item in the Japanese national budget. The expenditure figure for this fee must be approved by the United States every year. Later, the United States stipulated that if the Japanese side requested a reduction in the "defense burden sharing fee," then the expenditure for Japan's own arms expansion would have to be doubled. Therefore, the expenditure figure of Japan's military spending each year and how to spend it must be approved by the United States in advance. The United States, through "defense burden sharing fees," not only interferes with Japan's military spending but also interferes with Japan's entire finances.
    Taking this year as an example, the direct military expenditure in the Japanese fiscal year 1957 (April 1, 1957, to the end of March 1958) is 141.1 billion yen (360 yen equals one U.S. dollar). Among them, the "defense burden sharing fee" accounts for 29.6 billion yen, a decrease of 400 million yen compared to last year; however, the expenditure for Japan's own arms expansion, the "Defense Agency Fee," is 101 billion yen, and the so-called "facility provision fee" for maintaining U.S. military bases and U.S. military advisory groups is 10.5 billion yen. The total of these two items is an increase of 800 million yen compared to last year. Therefore, overall, Japan's military spending this year has increased by 400 million yen compared to last year's 140.7 billion yen.
    The "defense burden sharing fee" issue arises from the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, signed in September 1951 simultaneously with the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and the Administrative Agreement signed in February 1952 according to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. These two treaties stipulate that after the abolition of the occupation institutions, U.S. troops will continue to be stationed in Japan and retain military bases in Japan. It can be seen from this that if all U.S. troops are not withdrawn from Japan and all U.S. military bases are not abolished, it will be difficult to guarantee Japan's financial independence.
    Unresolved Issues Regarding Debt
    In addition to the "defense burden sharing fee" issue, the United States also influences Japan's finances through Japan's debt to the United States. In the early days of Japan's surrender, the United States took advantage of Japan's economic difficulties to sell large quantities of surplus materials such as wheat, barley, and cotton to Japan in the name of "occupation area relief fees" and "occupation area economic recovery fees." According to the "World Weekly" published in Japan on January 21 this year, these two amounts totaled 1.954 billion U.S. dollars. If the part that was not actually handed over to Japan is removed and Japan's claims against the United States are deducted, the actual figure is 1.889 billion U.S. dollars.
    Since 1954, Japan and the United States have begun to discuss how to repay this debt. During the negotiations, the United States put forward relatively harsh conditions. The United States advocated that Japan should repay 37.6% of the actual total debt, that is, 708 million U.S. dollars, according to the West German model; no payments would be made in the first five years after the agreement was reached, and then it would be paid off in thirty years, with an annual interest rate of 2.5%. The Japanese side believes that Japan is not as capable of repaying as West Germany, so it requested to repay 500 million U.S. dollars, at most no more than 600 million U.S. dollars. In terms of repayment conditions, if it is indeed a repayment of 500 million U.S. dollars, the Japanese side hopes that there will be no interest, payment will begin now, and it will be allowed to pay in yen as much as possible. Due to the strong attitude of the United States, this issue has remained an outstanding issue between Japan and the United States.
    Trade and "Special Procurement"
    Since the end of World War II, controlling Japan's economy through trade has been one of the important means adopted by the United States. Japan's trade with the United States ranks first in Japan's export and import trade. Taking 1955 as an example, Japan's exports to the United States were 449 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 22% of Japan's total exports; imports from the United States were 773 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 31% of Japan's total imports. Japan's trade with the United States has a huge deficit every year. Because the United States has always regarded Japan as a market for selling surplus American materials, but its own market is only open to Japan to a limited extent. In addition to Japan's deficit of more than 320 million U.S. dollars in 1955, in recent years, the deficit with the United States has reached about 500 million U.S. dollars every year. The situation in fiscal year 1956 was the same. According to news released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Japan's total exports in fiscal year 1956 were 2.598 billion U.S. dollars, total imports were 3.6 billion U.S. dollars, and the total deficit reached 1 billion U.S. dollars. Most of this is the deficit with the United States.
    The large deficit in Japan's foreign trade caused by U.S.-Japan trade has forced Japan to rely on the military expenditure of U.S. forces stationed in Japan, U.S. overseas procurement (the United States purchases materials from Japan to "aid" some Southeast Asian countries), and even the personal consumption of U.S. troops in Japan. Japan's income from this source is about 500 to 600 million U.S. dollars every year, known as broad "special procurement." As of the end of 1955, the total amount of "special procurement" had reached 3.5 billion U.S. dollars. This "special procurement" has in fact become a means for Japan to balance its international payments and is also one of the means by which the United States controls the Japanese economy. In order to get rid of the heavy control of the United States, Japan has always hoped that the United States would open its market, relax its "embargo" restrictions on our country, and assist Japan in expanding trade with Southeast Asian countries, in order to reduce Japan's trade deficit and dependence on the United States. However, the situation in this regard is completely unsatisfactory to Japan.
    Taking the U.S. market itself as an example, last year was the peak year for Japan's exports to the United States, with total exports of approximately 600 million U.S. dollars for the year. Most of the export goods are textiles, aquatic products, and sundries. Therefore, since last year, the movement of U.S. manufacturers against the import of Japanese cotton fabrics and sundries has been expanding day by day. Finally, on January 16 this year, the Japanese government had no choice but to formally announce that in the next five years, Japan will automatically restrict the export of cotton fabrics to the United States, with the quantity stipulated at 235 million square yards per year, which is a decrease of 35 million square yards compared to the actual export volume in 1955. Japan's trade with our country has been greatly restricted because the United States has always been unwilling to relax its "embargo" restrictions on our country. In Southeast Asia, the idea of developing Southeast Asia with U.S. funds, Japanese technology, and local raw materials and labor to expand Japan's commodity exports has always been a one-sided idea of Japan. When former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida visited the United States in November 1954, in addition to requesting a loan of 1 billion U.S. dollars from the United States, he also hoped that the United States could invest 4 billion U.S. dollars in Southeast Asia every year. However, because this plan of Japan involves the vital interests of the United States in Southeast Asia, it is difficult to realize. For example, when Japan reached an agreement with the Philippines on the issue of compensation, and Japan put forward economic cooperation proposals with the Philippines, American newspapers sharply criticized that Japan's approach was a challenge to the United States.
    The composition of U.S.-Japan trade also shows the United States' control over the Japanese economy. Japan is originally a country lacking raw materials. Since the end of World War II, most of the raw materials for Japan's important industries such as steel, textiles, petroleum, and chemicals have come from the United States. In recent years, this situation has changed, such as raw materials such as iron ore, petroleum, and cotton have gradually turned to rely on Asian countries, but many important raw materials are still dependent on the United States. Taking 1955 as an example, among the important raw materials imported by Japan, 83% of coking coal, 51% of scrap iron for steelmaking, 29% of cotton, and 15% of petroleum came from the United States. In Japan's export trade, the United States is also an important market for Japanese light industrial products. Taking last year as an example, Japan's exports to the United States accounted for more than 22% of total exports. Among the export goods, more than half of Japan's exports of raw silk, silk fabrics, sewing machines, and frozen tuna are sold to the United States. Therefore, the increase or decrease in Japan's exports to the United States not only affects the balance of Japan's foreign trade, but also affects various sectors of Japan's light industry and aquatic products industry.
    Activities of U.S. Private Capital in Japan
    According to the Japanese magazine "Economist" published on August 4, 1956, U.S. private capital investment in Japan had reached more than 130 million U.S. dollars by the end of May last year. Among them, investment in purchasing stocks was 29.4 million U.S. dollars; loan investment was 102.6 million U.S. dollars. These investments are mainly concentrated in industries such as petroleum and chemicals. For example, as of the end of March last year, foreign capital controlled 48% of all stocks in Japan's oil refining industry; 15% of all stocks in the chemical industry; 11% of all stocks in the electrical machinery industry; and 9% of all stocks in light industries such as aluminum. Among these foreign capitals, 70% are U.S. capital.
    In terms of companies, among the 76 Japanese companies in which foreign capital participates in management, there are 19 companies whose 60% of capital is controlled by foreign capital. In particular, the oil refining industry can be said to no longer be considered a Japanese enterprise. Because in the nine oil refining companies, there are five companies whose 50% of capital is controlled by foreign capital, mainly U.S. capital. The main responsible persons of these companies are Americans. Due to these activities of U.S. private capital, some important Japanese enterprises have become subordinate to the United States.
    The above are some of the main problems that currently exist in the economic relationship between Japan and the United States. It can be seen from these problems that even today, when Japan's industrial and mining production has doubled compared to before the war, the United States still wants to use various methods to control Japan's economy. Of course, this has become increasingly unbearable for the Japanese bourgeoisie. In terms of the economy, Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States will first require the U.S. government to open the U.S. domestic market, relax the "embargo" restrictions on our country, and hope that the United States will provide funds to cooperate with Japan in developing Southeast Asia. Before going to the United States, Nobusuke Kishi first took a trip to Southeast Asia. The purpose was to enhance friendly relations with Southeast Asian countries, explore the attitudes of various countries towards Japan's assistance in developing the Southeast Asian economy, and understand market conditions, so that he could be in a favorable position in negotiations with the United States. However, in these areas, so far, the United States has not made any clear indication. It is very doubtful how much Nobusuke Kishi can gain from his trip to the United States.

　　日美经济关系中的几个问题
　　庄涛
    日本本来是一个军事的、封建的帝国主义国家，自从1945年8月15日向盟国宣布无条件投降以后，就处在美国帝国主义的完全占领之下，丧失了独立。1952年4月，美、英等国和日本缔结的旧金山和约生效以后，日本便由完全被占领状态演变为半被占领国，取得了形式上的独立。最近几年来，由于日本经济的迅速恢复和发展，日本资产阶级要求在经济上摆脱美国控制、走独立发展道路的趋势，已一天比一天明显。在这方面，尽管美国依旧想用各种办法，加强对日本经济的控制，但是日本要求独立发展的这一趋势，已是难以阻挡的了。日本首相岸信介的美国之行，其目的之一，就是将要求缓和目前日美经济关系中存在的一部分矛盾，以利于日本经济向着比较独立的方向发展。
    美国对日本财政的干涉
    在旧金山和约生效以前，日本的财政以至整个经济生活，都在美国操纵之下。旧金山和约生效以后，情况发生了变化，占领机构取消了。但是美国依旧通过“防卫分担费”，每年干涉日本预算的编制。“防卫分担费”是日本每年支付给驻日美军的费用，包括在日本国家预算的直接军费项内。这笔费用的开支数字，每年必须取得美国的同意。以后，美国又规定，如果日本方面要求削减“防卫分担费”，那么就要加倍地增加日本本身扩军的费用。因此，每年日本军费的开支数字和如何开支，都必须事先得到美国的同意。美国通过“防卫分担费”不仅干涉了日本的军费，也干涉了日本的整个财政。
    以今年为例。1957年度（1957年4月1日至1958年3月底）日本岁出项内的直接军费开支为一千四百十一亿日元（三百六十日元合一美元）。其中“防卫分担费”占二百九十六亿日元，比去年度减少了四亿日元；但是日本本身扩军用的“防卫厅费”的开支为一千零十亿日元，维持美国军事基地及美国军事顾问团的所谓“提供设施费”为一百零五亿日元，两者合计比去年度增加了八亿日元。因此总的来说，本年度的日本军费开支，比去年度的一千四百零七亿日元，还是增加了四亿日元。
    “防卫分担费”的问题，是由1951年9月和旧金山和约同时签订的日美安全保障条约和1952年2月根据日美安全保障条约签订的行政协定所产生的。在这两个条约里，规定占领机构撤销后，美军继续留驻日本，并在日本保留军事基地。从这里可以看出，如果不从日本撤退一切美国军队和取消所有美国军事基地的话，日本财政的独立是很难得到保证的。
    关于债务问题的悬案
    除了“防卫分担费”问题以外，美国还通过日本对美国的债务，影响着日本的财政。日本投降初期，美国利用日本经济的困难，以“占领区救济费”和“占领区经济复兴费”的名义，向日本大量推销小麦、大麦、棉花等剩余物资。据今年1月21日日本出版的“世界周报”所载，这两笔款项合计共为十九亿五千四百万美元，如果除去实际上并未交给日本的部分及扣除日本对美国的债权，实际数字为十八亿八千九百万美元。
    1954年以来，日本和美国开始商谈如何归还这一债务的问题。在商谈过程中，美国提出了比较苛刻的条件。美国主张日本要按照西德的方式，归还实际债务总额的37.6％，即七亿八百万美元；在取得协议后的最初五年内不付款，以后分三十年还清，年利2.5％。日本方面则认为在归还能力上日本不如西德，因此要求归还五亿美元，最多不超过六亿美元。在归还条件上，如果确是归还五亿美元的话，日本方面希望没有利息，现在就开始支付，并且允许尽量以日元支付。由于美方态度强硬，这一问题到现在一直成为日美间的悬案。
    贸易和“特需”
    自从第二次世界大战结束以来，通过贸易控制日本的经济，一直是美国采取的重要手段之一。日本对美国的贸易，不论在日本的出口或进口贸易中，都占第一位。以1955年来说，日本对美国的出口为四亿四千九百万美元，占日本出口总额的22％；从美国的进口为七亿七千三百万美元，占日本进口总额的31％。日本对美国的贸易每年都发生巨额的入超。因为美国一直把日本当作推销美国剩余物资的市场，但是本国的市场却又有限度地向日本开放。除1955年日本对美入超三亿二千余万美元以外，最近这几年来，对美入超额每年都达到五亿美元左右。1956年度的情况也是一样。据日本大藏省发表的消息，1956年度日本的出口总额为二十五亿九千八百万美元，进口总额为三十六亿美元，入超总额达十亿美元。其中大部分就是对美国的入超。
    由于日美贸易而引起的日本对外贸易的大量入超，迫使日本不得不依靠驻日美军的军需支出、美国的海外采购（美国向日本采购物资“援助”东南亚某些国家）、以至美军在日本的个人消费。日本这笔收入每年约在五亿至六亿美元，名为广义的“特需”。截至1955年末，“特需”的总额已达三十五亿美元。这笔“特需”，事实上已经成为日本平衡国际收支的手段，同时也是美国控制日本经济的手段之一。为了摆脱美国的重重控制，日本一直希望美国开放它的市场、放宽对我国的“禁运”限制、和协助日本扩大同东南亚各国的贸易，以减少日本的贸易逆差和对美国的依赖。但是这方面的情况，是完全不能使日本满意的。
    以美国本身的市场来说，去年是日本对美输出达到最高峰的一年，全年的出口总额约六亿美元。出口货中大半都是纺织品、水产品和杂货。因此从去年以来，美国制造商反对输入日本棉织品和杂货等的运动，一天比一天扩大。最后迫使日本政府不得不在今年1月16日，正式宣布在今后五年内，日本将自动限制向美国输出棉织品，数量规定为每年二亿三千五百万平方码，比1955年的实际输出量还减少三千五百万平方码。日本对我国的贸易，由于美国一直不愿放宽对我国的“禁运”限制，因此使这一贸易的发展受到了很大限制。在东南亚方面，用美国的资金、日本的技术、当地的原料和劳动力开发东南亚，以扩大日本的商品输出一事，一向是日本单方面的想法。当1954年11月日本前首相吉田茂访问美国的时候，除要求美国对日贷款十亿美元以外，也曾希望美国每年能对东南亚投资四十亿美元。但是由于日本这一计划牵涉到美国在东南亚的切身利益，因此实现是有困难的。例如当日本和菲律宾的赔偿问题取得协议，日本提出和菲律宾的经济合作建议以后，美国的报纸就曾尖锐地指责说，日本这种做法是对美国的挑战。
    在日美贸易的构成上，也可以看到美国对日本经济的控制。日本本来是一个缺乏原料的国家。第二次世界大战结束以来，日本的钢铁、纺织、石油、化学等重要工业的原料，大多来自美国。近年来这一情况有了变化，如铁矿砂、石油、棉花等原料逐渐转而依靠亚洲国家，但许多重要原料仍旧是依赖美国的。以1955年来说，日本输入的重要原料中，炼焦用煤的83％，炼钢用废铁的51％，棉花的29％，石油的15％都来自美国。在日本的出口贸易中，美国也是日本轻工业品的重要市场。以去年来说，日本对美国的出口，占出口总额的22％以上。在出口货中，日本出口的生丝、绢织物、缝纫机、冻鲔鱼等的一半以上，都是销到美国的。因此，日本对美国出口的增减，不仅影响到日本对外贸易的平衡，同时也影响到日本轻工业和水产业的各个部门。
    美国私人资本在日本的活动
    战后美国私人资本在日本的投资，据1956年8月4日出版的日本“经济学人”杂志所载，截至去年5月末，已达一亿三千余万美元。其中购买股票的投资为二千九百四十万美元；贷款投资为一亿二百六十万美元。这些投资主要集中在石油、化学等工业。如截至去年3月末，外国资本掌握了日本石油精制工业的全部股票的48％；化学工业全部股票的15％；电气机械工业全部股票的11％；铝等轻工业全部股票的9％。在这些外国资本中，有70％是美国资本。
    以公司来说，在外国资本参与经营的七十六家日本公司中，有十九家公司，其资本的60％被掌握在外国资本手中。特别是石油精制业，可以说已经不能算作是日本的企业。因为在九家精制石油的公司中，有五家公司，其资本的50％被控制在外国资本，主要是美国资本的手中。这些公司的主要负责人，由美国人担任。由于美国私人资本的这些活动，已使日本某些重要企业隶属于美国。
    以上是目前日美经济关系中存在的一些主要问题。从这些问题中可以看出，美国在日本工矿业生产已比战前增加一倍的今天，依旧想用各种办法控制日本的经济，当然这已使日本的资产阶级越来越不能忍受。岸信介的美国之行，在经济方面将首先要求美国政府开放美国国内市场，放宽对我国的“禁运”限制，并希望美国提供资金，同日本合作开发东南亚。岸信介在去美国之前，先到东南亚跑了一趟，其目的就是要增进同东南亚国家之间的友好关系，试探各国对日本协助开发东南亚经济的态度，了解市场情况，使他自己在同美国谈判中处于有利的地位。但是在这些方面，到目前为止，美国还没有什么比较明确的表示。岸信介到美国究竟能获得多大收获，是很值得怀疑的。
