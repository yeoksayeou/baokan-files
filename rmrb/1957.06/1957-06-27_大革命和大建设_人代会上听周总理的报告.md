Great Revolution and Great Construction
　　——Listening to Premier Zhou's Report at the National People's Congress
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Pei
    High summer has come to Beijing.

    The Hall of Benevolence in Zhongnanhai, year after year in this hot summer, welcomes the People's Representatives for the third time. The first meeting of the "NPC" was held in the early autumn of 1954. Since then, when the thermometer rises above thirty degrees Celsius, the People's Representatives have gathered in this ancient hall year after year.

    Time can repeat and coincide, but our cause never stands still. When the representatives entered the vermillion gates of the Hall of Benevolence again after a year, our country—a country led by the working class—erected another milestone, forever to be remembered by future generations, on its road forward: the socialist revolution that transformed the millennia-old private ownership of the means of production into public ownership, achieved a basic victory in a country with a population of six hundred million and a backward economy.

    1956 was “...a year in which these great and glorious achievements were recorded in our country’s history.” Premier Zhou Enlai, whom we are all very familiar with, began his long report of more than thirty thousand words with these magnificent but objectively true words. The basis for his report was the following indisputable great facts: one hundred and twenty million peasant households, more than five million handicraftsmen, and two million capitalist industrial and commercial households have permanently broken away from the track of private ownership. The socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production has basically triumphed, and all roads leading to capitalism have been blocked from now on.

    Warm applause shook the ornate hall of the Hall of Benevolence. The representatives deeply knew how important these words were—the people's labor and struggle exchanged for this glorious achievement.

    History tells us that whether it was the bourgeois revolution in 17th-century England or the French Revolution in the 18th century, each change in ownership brought the people long periods of turmoil, chaos, and the threat of hunger and death. Not to mention these, every time a feudal dynasty changed in our country's history, which time did the new dynasty's monarch not cause widespread suffering and bloodshed in order to establish his rule?

    But in just over a year, we have completed this earth-shaking transformation of ownership. This is a great transformation aimed at permanently eliminating exploitation and classes, which no bourgeois revolution can match. However, almost all the people, including those "big households" with huge properties, did not suffer too violent a shock, and smoothly approached the socialist shore from the capitalist shore. Although some people still feel unaccustomed to the new social system, habits will eventually develop slowly.

    Premier Zhou Enlai said in his report: "In such a great revolutionary process, social property has not been damaged, social order has not been disrupted, and social production has not declined. On the contrary, in the first year of our basic victory in this great revolution, we have achieved great results in all aspects." There are only a few sentences, but this is a summary of history. Even those gentlemen who are accustomed to calling white black cannot change this stubborn fact.

    The people cheered for victory. But nature does not therefore adapt to the will of the people. In 1956, unprecedented and enormous disasters struck northern, central, and southern China. More than two hundred million mu of land and about seventy million people were under the threat of famine. The nascent agricultural collective ownership system underwent a severe test. "Can it stand?" some well-intentioned but not-so-clear-minded people drew question marks. A few malicious people secretly rejoiced.

    What is the vitality of the socialist system? Premier Zhou answered this question with facts. In this year, the total agricultural output value still increased by 2.74 billion yuan compared with 1955, reaching 58.3 billion yuan, which is close to the target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan; the grain output (excluding soybeans) increased by 15.4 billion jin compared with 1955, reaching 365 billion jin, exceeding the target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan. Premier Zhou also mentioned that, except for areas severely affected by disasters, more than 75 percent of farmers across the country increased their incomes. For disaster areas, the government paid 860 million yuan and increased the transfer of 7 billion jin of grain from July last year to the present.

    Overcoming disasters, increasing grain production, and increasing income, hundreds of millions of farmers in our country, in the first year of the full implementation of collective ownership, demonstrated their great confidence and strength in the new system.

    The Communist Party is not a magician and cannot conjure up socialism in an instant. The broad masses of people have a strong desire to take the socialist road, but desire is not equal to reality. If so, then why were we able to complete such a huge socialist revolutionary transformation smoothly and in a relatively short period of time? Is this accidental? No. The problem lies in creating conditions and preparing the conditions for historical development.

    Premier Zhou said: "In 1949, after the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution throughout the country, our revolution entered the socialist revolution period. Subsequently, we successively carried out the five major movements of land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, and ideological remolding." The results of these movements are well known. The five major movements paved the way for the advancement of the three major transformations. The victory of the five major movements ensured that the three major transformations could be carried out smoothly and step by step, and completed this unprecedented social transformation in a relatively short period of time. Some people who felt that the mass struggle of the five major movements was "too fierce," and some people who still held some "doubts," should now see very clearly that without this storm of mass struggle to cleanse the filth of the old era and raise the consciousness of the masses, could we have so smoothly achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution? Definitely not. A few die-hard class enemies who refused to change their positions always wanted to find opportunities to attack the "deviations" in the five major movements, and loudly exaggerated that if the achievements of these movements were basic, and the deviations and errors were individual, it would be "dogmatism," "formulas," and "new stereotyped writing." Premier Zhou sternly refuted these slanders of the right-wing elements, pointing out that this argument "is to exaggerate mistakes, obliterate achievements, and guide some people with unstable positions or unclear right and wrong to regard these individual or partial deviations and errors as the fundamental or comprehensive errors of these movements, in order to achieve their goal of shaking the fruits of the revolutionary movement and opposing the socialist revolution."

    Premier Zhou Enlai, with clear logic, pointed out the basic reasons for this great historical transformation: "Understanding the historical development process of the above-mentioned five major movements and three major transformations and their interrelationships, we can understand the fundamental reason why, in the first year after the historical transformation involving the lives of six hundred million people, industrial and agricultural production can not only proceed normally but also achieve great development." A storm of applause suddenly erupted in the hall. People's representatives from all walks of life, many of whom had experienced the three major transformations and five major movements, deeply understood this interrelationship and were witnesses to the great achievements of various tasks.

    We often tend to overlook a major feature, that is, our country's socialist construction is carried out simultaneously with the socialist revolution. Great revolution plus great construction, it is very difficult for us to find such an example elsewhere.

    1956 was a year of leap-forward development in our country's socialist construction. Encouraged by the upsurge of the socialist revolution, millions of working people displayed unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity, and promoted the country's construction cause at a high speed. The scale of construction and the growth of production both greatly exceeded the previous three years, and some even exceeded the sum of the growth in the previous three years. That is to say, one year completed the quota of three years.

    Premier Zhou's report clarified that in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value increased by 17.7 billion yuan, while in 1956 alone it increased by 13.9 billion yuan, bringing our country's total industrial output value to 58.6 billion yuan, exceeding the 1957 target required by the Five-Year Plan. The foundation of the industrial foundation—steel production—increased by a total of 1.5 million tons in the first three years, while in 1956 alone it increased by 1.61 million tons. Important new products that our country had never produced in its history, such as jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, large-scale power generation equipment, and single-axle automatic vehicles, were also successfully manufactured in this year.

    Every patriotic person will cheer for the huge progress of our country. Although there are still six months left until the end of 1957, it can be said with certainty that the overall goals set by the first Five-Year Plan can definitely be completed, and in some respects, the original targets can be exceeded. However, some elements hostile to socialism insist on fighting against the facts, daydreaming that the first Five-Year Plan was ruined.

      Premier Zhou powerfully refuted these right-wing gentlemen who yearn for a capitalist economy: "Some people think that our country's first Five-Year Plan was ruined, which is completely wrong. Whether from the perspective of industrial production, agricultural production, capital construction, cultural education, or financial revenue and expenditure, our country's first Five-Year Plan was successful, it was done well rather than ruined." Even the most sophistical right-wing elements could not resist the iron-like facts listed in the report: our country can produce a total of 16.3 million tons of steel during the first Five-Year Plan period, while the total steel production in old China, including Northeast China during the Japanese invasion, from 1900 to 1948, a total of forty-nine years, was only 7.6 million tons. In five years, we built a total of 8,500 kilometers of railways, while the Kuomintang government only built more than 2,600 kilometers during its twenty-two years of rule.

    The representatives repeatedly used thunderous applause to praise Premier Zhou's report, and also to praise the great achievements created by millions of working people in these years.

    During the intermission of the report, the representatives gathered in the shelters behind the Hall of Benevolence and had heated conversations with each other. Next to the reporter, one representative said: "Premier Zhou's refutation of the rightists in the report is good and very convincing." Another representative said: "This makes my own thinking much clearer." At the preparatory meeting a few days ago, in various groups, the representatives had already launched a counterattack against the challenge of the rightists. Now, Premier Zhou's report has given them more powerful weapons. When the meeting was held today, the outdoor temperature was as high as thirty-five degrees Celsius. The small shops in the shelters were particularly busy during the break, and the representatives paid for soda and ice cream to quench their thirst.

    After the break, Premier Zhou continued his report by talking about the gradual improvement of the people's lives, the basic system of our country as a guarantee for building socialism in our country, and the help of the great Soviet Union in our country's construction cause. In each section of his speech, Premier Zhou refuted the anti-socialist fallacies of the right-wing elements with reason. While affirming the achievements of each national task, Premier Zhou always pointed out the shortcomings and errors in the work in a realistic manner. However, it needs to be emphasized that the unshakable proletarian position and viewpoint runs like a red thread through this three-hour report, giving a powerful Marxist answer to the arrogant challenges of the right-wing elements for more than a month.

    I was reminded of a poem written by Mayakovsky nearly forty years ago, in 1918: "Left March." There are these lines in this poem:
    The proletarian's fingers
    Will seize the world's throat
    Like heavenly fire.
    The proletariat is destined to overturn the entire old world. Old China has been overturned. If anyone still wants to pull China back to the miserable old world, it is as impossible as a mantis trying to stop a chariot. All the "warriors" who challenge the basic principles of socialism and the leadership of the proletariat should learn some lessons from Premier Zhou's report.

　　大革命和大建设
　　——人代会上听周总理的报告
    本报记者  张沛
    盛夏来到北京。
    中南海内的怀仁堂，一年一度地在这炎热的夏季迎接人民代表，已经是第三次了。“人大”的第一次会议是在1954年的初秋召开的。从那以后，当温度表升到摄氏三十度以上的时候，人民代表们就一年一度地来到这个古老的殿堂集会了。
    时间可以重复和巧合，可是我们的事业永不停留在原地。当代表们隔了一年又走进怀仁堂的朱红大门时，我们的国家——工人阶级领导的国家，在它前进的道路上，又树立了一块永为后人所铭记的里程碑——几千年的生产资料私有制变为公有制的社会主义革命，在一个六亿人口、经济落后的国家里取得了基本胜利。
    1956年是以“……这些伟大光辉的成就载入我国史册的一年”。我们大家都很熟悉的周恩来总理，用这种豪壮的然而客观实在的话语，开始了他的三万多字的长篇报告。为它的报告作根据的，是这样一些无可置疑的伟大事实：一亿二千万农户、五百多万手工业者、二百万户资本主义工商业，永远脱离了私有制的轨道。生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命基本胜利了，一切通往资本主义的道路，从此被堵塞了。
    热烈的掌声震动着雕梁画栋的怀仁堂大厅。代表们深知这句话有多么重大的分量——人民的劳动和斗争，换取了这光辉的成就。
    历史告诉我们，不论是十七世纪英国的资产阶级革命，或者是十八世纪的法国大革命，每一次所有制的变革，都给人民带来了长时期的动荡、混乱以及饥饿和死亡的威胁。不说这些，我国历史上每一次封建王朝的更迭，新朝代的君主为了确立他的统治，那一次又不是生灵涂炭、血泪成河？
    而我们在一年多的时间中，完成了这种翻天复地的所有制大变革。这是一次目的在于永远消灭剥削、消灭阶级的大变革，是任何资产阶级革命所无法比拟的。可是，几乎全体人民，包括那些有巨额财产的“大户”，并没有受到太剧烈的震动，就从资本主义的彼岸，平稳地靠拢社会主义的此岸。虽然有些人对新社会的制度还感觉不习惯，但习惯终会慢慢养成的。
    周恩来总理在他的报告中说：“在这样一个大革命的过程里，社会财产没有遭到损坏，社会秩序没有发生混乱，社会生产没有下降。恰恰相反，我们在这个大革命取得基本胜利的第一年，就在各方面取得了巨大的成绩。”话只有几句，但这是历史的总结。就是那些惯于把白说成黑的先生们，也无法改变这个顽强的事实。
    人民为胜利欢呼。可是自然界并不因此就一切都适应人民的意志。1956年，空前巨大的灾荒，袭击着我国的北部、中部和南部。二亿多亩土地、约七千万人口处在灾荒的威胁下。新生的农业集体所有制经受着严酷的考验。“站得住吗？”一些心好然而认识不大清楚的人，画出了问号。少数心怀恶意的人暗暗高兴。
    社会主义制度的生命力究竟怎么样？周总理用事实回答了这个问题。这一年农业总产值仍然比1955年增加了二十七亿四千万元，达到五百八十三亿元，已经接近第一个五年计划最后一年的指标；粮食的产量（不包括大豆），比1955年增加了一百五十四亿斤，达到三千六百五十亿斤，超过了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。周总理还提到，全国除了灾情严重的地区以外，百分之七十五以上的农户增加了收入。对于灾区，政府支付了八亿六千万元，由去年7月到现在增调了七十亿斤粮食。
    战胜灾荒，增产粮食，增加收入，我国成亿的农民在全面实行集体所有制的第一年，表现了对新制度的巨大信心和力量。
    共产党并不是魔术家，不能在倏忽间变出个社会主义。广大人民有走社会主义道路的强烈愿望，但是愿望并不等于现实。既然如此，那末为什么我们能平平稳稳、在比较短的时间内就完成了这样巨大的社会主义革命的转变呢？这是偶然的吗？不。问题在于创造条件，准备好历史发展的条件。
    周总理说：“1949年，资产阶级民主革命在全国范围内取得胜利后，我国革命就进入了社会主义革命时期。接着，我们先后进行了土地改革、抗美援朝、肃清反革命、三反五反和思想改造的五大运动。”这些运动的成果是大家所熟知的。五大运动为三大改造的前进铺平了道路。五大运动的胜利保证了三大改造能够顺利地、有步骤地进行，并且在比较短的时间内，完成了这种史无前例的社会大变革。一些在五大运动的群众斗争的暴风雨中，感觉“过于猛烈”的人们，还抱着某种“怀疑”的人们，现在应当看得很清楚了，没有这种群众斗争的暴风雨，来涤除那些旧时代的污秽，提高群众的觉悟，我们能够如此顺利地取得社会主义革命的基本胜利吗？肯定是不能。少数死硬地不肯改变自己立场的敌对阶级分子，总想寻找机会来攻击五大运动中的“偏差”，并且大肆渲染地说：如果说这些运动的成绩是基本的，偏差和错误是个别的，就是“教条主义”，就是“公式”，就是“新八股”。周总理严正批驳了这些右派分子的谰言，指明这种论调“就是为了夸大错误、抹煞成绩，引导一些立场不稳或者不明是非的人把这些个别性质或者部分性质的偏差和错误，看成是这些运动的根本性质或者全面性质的错误，以达到他们动摇革命运动成果、反对社会主义革命的目的。”
    周恩来总理，用明晰的逻辑，指明了这伟大的历史转变的基本原因：“了解了上述五大运动和三大改造的历史发展过程及其相互关系，就可以了解在涉及六万万人民生活的历史大变革后的第一年，工农业生产不仅能够正常进行而且能够获得很大发展的根本原因。”全场中顿时掀起了暴风雨般的掌声。来自各方面的人民代表，许多都经历过三大改造和五大运动，他们是深切了解这种相互关系的，他们是各项工作取得巨大成就的见证人。
    我们常常易于忽视一个重大的特点，即我国的社会主义建设是和社会主义革命同时进行的。大革命加大建设，我们还很不容易在另外的地方找到这样的例子。
    1956年是我国社会主义建设跃进发展的一年。在社会主义革命高潮中受到了鼓舞的千百万劳动人民，发挥了空前的积极性和创造性，把国家的建设事业高速度地向前推进。建设的规模、生产的增长都大大超过了前三年，有些甚至超过前三年增长的总和。也就是说，一年完成了三年的定额。
    周总理的报告阐明：五年计划的前三年，工业总产值共增加了一百七十七亿元，而1956年一年即增长了一百三十九亿元，使我国的工业总产值达到五百八十六亿元，超过了五年计划
  所要求的1957年的指标。工业基础的基础——
  钢的产量，前三年共增加了一百五十万吨，而1956年一年即增加了一百六十一万吨。我国历史上从来没有生产过的喷气式飞机、载重汽车、大型发电设备和单轴自动车等重要新产品，也是在这一年制造成功的。
    每一个爱国的人，都会为我们国家这种巨大的进步欢呼。虽然现在离1957年年底还有半年，然而可以肯定地说，第一个五年计划规定的总目标是一定可以完成的，而在某些方面可以超过原定的指标。可是一些敌视社会主义的分子，偏偏要和事实作战，他们白日梦呓：第一个五年计划搞坏了。
      周总理强有力地批驳了这些向往资本主义经济的右派老爷们：“有人认为我国第一个五年计划搞坏了，这是完全错误的。无论从工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、文化教育或者财政收支那一方面来看，我国第一个五年计划都是成功的，是搞好了而不是搞坏了。”最会狡辩的右派分子也抵抗不了报告中列举的铁一般的事实：我国在第一个五年计划期间共计能生产钢一千六百三十万吨，而旧中国包括日本侵略时候的东北在内，从1900年到1948年，四十九年合计的钢产量不过七百六十万吨。五年中间，我们共新建了八千五百公里的铁路，而国民党政府在二十二年的统治期间内，只修建了二千六百多公里。
    代表们一再用雷鸣似的掌声，来赞扬周总理的报告，也是赞扬千百万劳动人民这几年中间所创造的丰功伟绩。
    报告中间休息的时候，代表们拥集到怀仁堂后面的凉棚里，相互间进行着热烈的交谈。在记者旁边，一个代表说：“周总理的报告中对右派批驳得好，很有说服力。”另一个代表则说：“这一来，我自己的思想就明确得多了。”前几天的预备会上，在各个小组里，代表们已经对右派的挑战展开了反击，现在，周总理的报告，给了他们更加有力的武器。今天开会的时候，室外气温高达三十五度，凉棚里的小卖部，休息时特别忙碌，代表们自己掏钱买汽水、冰淇淋解渴。
    休息以后，接着周总理在他的报告中谈到了人民生活逐步改善的状况，谈到了我们国家的基本制度是在我国建成社会主义的保证，谈到了在我国建设事业中，伟大苏联的帮助。在每一节的讲话中，周总理都据理驳斥了右派分子反社会主义的谬论。在肯定每一项国家工作的成就时，周总理总是实事求是地指出了工作中的缺点和错误。然而需要强调的是：不可动摇的无产阶级的立场和观点，像一根红线贯穿着这个历时三小时的报告，对一个多月以来，右派分子的狂妄挑战，作了强有力的马克思主义的回答。
    我想起了近四十年前即1918年马雅可夫斯基写的一首诗：“向左进行曲”。这首诗里有这样几句：
    无产者的手指
    将要天火似地
    擒住世界的咽喉。
    无产阶级是命定了要翻转整个旧世界的。旧中国已经被翻转过来，如果有谁还想把中国拉回到悲惨的旧世界去，那是像螳螂挡车一样办不到的。一切向社会主义的基本原则、向无产阶级领导权挑战的“勇士”们，应该从周总理的报告里得到些教训。
