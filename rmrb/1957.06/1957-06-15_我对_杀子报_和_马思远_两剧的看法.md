　　My Views on the Plays "Killing the Son in Retribution" and "Ma Siyuan"
　　Bai Yunsheng
    The function of opera is to praise good, brave, and wise characters, to satirize and criticize treacherous and ugly characters, to narrate stories, and to express emotions; it not only has educational significance, but also can reflect a country's people's thoughts and cultural level; therefore, opera is not just a trivial game. However, in the old society, it was merely regarded as a means of amusement, so actors were looked down upon and called "戏子" (actors/actresses, often with a derogatory connotation). Some actors, in order to satisfy people's vulgar and low tastes, pursued yellow or terrifying scenes; they used some unbearable words or nauseating performances to win people's appreciation and maintain their livelihoods.
    Since liberation, actors have been valued by the Party and the government, their political status has been greatly improved, and they have constantly performed abroad, introducing China's long-standing culture and art to foreign countries, receiving high international acclaim; this was something they could not even have dreamed of in the past. Therefore, our actors' stage performances and singing, recitation, and action performing arts should be carefully studied and gradually improved in order to meet the needs of the broad masses in the new era and strengthen our international position. Now, whether actors or audiences, after eight years of study, have improved their political and cultural levels. An actor's stage performance should be ahead of the masses and play an educational role; I think no one wants to fall from a position that has already been elevated to a state of inferiority and self-abandonment.
    In recent years, some leading comrades in literary and artistic circles have had incorrect views on the reform of classical drama, issuing some rigid rules that have prevented many programs from being staged, or have been changed beyond recognition; the Party and the government have already criticized this style. Now the Party calls for "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and even programs that were once banned have recently been unbanned; such measures are the Party and government's concern for the opera world, and can play a certain role in the development of opera. But what kind of understanding should our actors have of this?
    The traditional repertoire of each opera genre is a product of the old society, and some are inevitably tainted with toxins. Historically, during the Ming Hongwu and Qing Qianlong eras, the imperial court collected theatrical scripts from all over the country, using great efforts to modify them, making them tools for the ruling class to fool the people, so we must expend considerable effort now, whether in revising scripts or in stage performances. For example, "Romance of the West Chamber" is a very good anti-feudal play advocating freedom of marriage, but in the old society, some actors portrayed the character of Hongniang as extremely lewd, such as biting her lips, shrugging her shoulders, sticking out her stomach, holding a handkerchief in her mouth, and looking at the audience with improper eyes while rubbing her waist; what good does this kind of bad performance do for the audience? Recently, some troupes have been staging "Killing the Son in Retribution" on a large scale. I think this play has nothing commendable in terms of content and performance. When I was young, performing in the countryside and competing with Bangzi opera, there were actresses who used this play as a gimmick; when about to kill the son, they would loosen their clothes, revealing an arm, a red bib and its strap on their chest, holding a kitchen knife in their hand, and holding their loose hair in their mouth; Guan Bao would hide behind his sister, and the sister would kneel down and beg; when killing the son, they would throw fake meat pieces made of white flour onto the stage. This terrifying scene, not to mention children being frightened, even adults could not bear to watch. These bad performances must be deleted. But if a play like "Killing the Son in Retribution" removes that set of low, vulgar and bad performance images, it will no longer be attractive. If it is said that because the repertoire is not rich enough and the troupe's economic income is affected, one can look at the "Yang Naiwu and Xiao Baicai" performed by Wei Xikui's Quju troupe, which is also a case of adultery and murder, but why is it welcomed by the broad masses? This is worth considering.
    "Ma Siyuan" is a real event in Beijing that caused a sensation when it was staged in the old society. This play also has a murder scene: Zhao Yu, when killing her husband, held a crescent-shaped fake kitchen knife in her mouth, and when she chopped the knife on her husband's head, she sprayed red paint on her face, with blood dripping, indicating that the knife had penetrated his head; children were frightened and cried. In terms of performance, many erotic scenes of Zhao Yu flirting with the peddler Jia Ming have certainly been deleted, but what is left? Times have changed, and the audience's level has improved, people will no longer be attracted to that kind of vulgar performance.
    I am proud to be a modern actor, I love my profession, and I also love opera workers, so I have written down my personal views and feelings on these two plays for everyone's reference. This can also be regarded as a hundred schools of thought contending!

### 我对“杀子报”和“马思远”两剧的看法

　　我对“杀子报”和“马思远”两剧的看法
　　白云生
    戏曲的作用是歌颂善良、勇敢、智慧的人物，讽刺批判奸佞丑恶的人物，叙述故事，抒写情感；不但含有教育意义，而且能表现一个国家的人民思想和文化程度；所以戏曲并非游戏小道。可是旧社会仅仅把它当作开心取乐之用，故轻视演员，称为“戏子”。有些演员也就为满足人们庸俗低级趣味的要求，追求黄色或恐怖的场面；用一些不堪入耳的词句或令人肉麻的表演来博取人们的欣赏，维持自己的生活。
    解放以后，演员们得到党和政府的重视，政治地位大大提高，而且不断的出国表演，将中国历史悠久的文化艺术介绍到国外，国际上给予很高的估价；这是过去连作梦也想不到的。因此我们演员在舞台上的表现形态和唱、念、动作的表演艺术，就应当十分仔细研究和逐步提高，才能符合新时代广大群众的需要，加强在国际上的地位。现在不论是演员或观众，经过了八年的学习，提高了政治文化水平。一个演员在舞台表现上，应当走在群众前面，起到教育作用；我想没有一个人愿意从已被提高的地位上降落到自卑自弃的境地。
    几年来有一部分文艺界领导同志对古典戏剧的改革有不正确的看法，出了些清规戒律，使许多节目不能上演，或被改得面目全非；对这种作风，党和政府已经进行了批判。现在党号召“百花齐放”，连曾经禁演的节目最近也开禁了；这样的措施是党和政府对于戏曲界的关怀，能在戏曲发展上起到一定作用。但是我们演员对于这一点，应该有怎样的认识？
    各剧种传统剧目都是旧社会的产物，有的难免有些毒素。在历史记载上，明洪武、清乾隆时代，搜集全国剧本，用很大的力量加以修改，使之成为附属于统治阶级的愚民工具，所以我们现在不论在修改剧本或舞台表演上，都必须费相当的力量。例如：“西厢记”是一个很好的反封建、争取婚姻自由的剧本，在旧社会部分演员将红娘这个人物演成极端淫荡，如咬嘴唇、端肩膀、腆腹部、叼手帕，用不正当的眼神望着观众揉裤腰；这样恶劣的表演，对于观众有什么好处呢？最近有些剧团大演“杀子报”，我认为这种戏在内容和表演上都毫无可取之处。我幼年在乡间演唱与梆子腔打对台时，有女演员演这个戏作为号召；在将要杀子时，解开衣襟，露出一只胳膊，胸前露红肚兜和兜练，手执菜刀，口衔甩发；官保藏在其姊身后，姊则跪地哀求；杀子时，用白面做的假肉块扔在台口。这个恐怖的场面，不要说儿童看了害怕，就是成年人也不忍看。这些恶劣的表演一定要删除的。但像“杀子报”这样的戏，如取消了那一套低级庸俗恶劣的表演形象，也就没有吸引人的地方。如果说是因剧目不丰富，剧团经济收入方面受影响，可以看魏喜奎的曲剧团演的“杨乃武与小白菜”，也是奸杀案，但为什么却受到广大群众的欢迎呢？这是值得我们考虑的。
    “马思远”是北京的实事，在旧社会上演，轰动一时。这个戏也有凶杀的场面：赵玉杀夫时用一把月牙式假菜刀衔在口内，她将刀砍在其夫头上时，喷上满脸红彩，鲜血淋漓，表示刀已陷入头部，儿童看了，唬得哭叫。在表演上赵玉与货郎贾明调情的许多色情场面，肯定是被删除了，可是留下来的还有什么呢？时代不同了，观众水平提高了，人们是不会再被那种恶俗的表演所吸引了。
    我以做一个现代演员而自豪，我热爱自己的业务，也热爱戏曲工作者，因此将我个人对这两出戏的看法和感想写出来供大家参考。这也算是百家争鸣吧！
