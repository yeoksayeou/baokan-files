Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a notice canceling the regulation that cadres spend four hours every Saturday morning studying political theory. From now on, cadres' theoretical study will be conducted entirely in their spare time.

The notice states: Since the implementation of the Saturday study system two years ago, cadres and people from all walks of life have gradually developed study habits. In addition, cadres now need to study a lot of content, and learning should be based on the principle of voluntariness. The occupation of work time for theoretical study has caused some dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish this regulation.

The notice requires Party organizations at all levels to continue to strengthen leadership over study and to adopt various methods such as personal self-study, organized lectures, voluntary study groups, and the establishment of political schools to attract cadres to participate voluntarily.

    上海市委发出通知
    干部学习改在业余时间
    新华社上海9日电　中共上海市委员会已发出通知，取消每星期六上午四小时为干部学习政治理论的规定。今后干部理论学习一律在业余时间进行。
    通知说：自从规定周六学习制度的两年来，干部和各界人士的学习习惯已逐渐养成，加以现在干部需要学习的内容很多，学习应贯彻自愿原则，理论学习占用工作时间，已引起了群众一些不满，因此，决定取消这一规定。
    通知中要求各级党组织仍应加强对学习的领导，可采取个人自修、组织讲座、自愿结合学习小组以及举办政治学校等多种办法，吸引干部自愿参加。
