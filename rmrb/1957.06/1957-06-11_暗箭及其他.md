　　Hidden Arrows and Other Things
　　Xia Zhifeng

　　Openly reactionary statements are relatively easy to identify, while "underlying meanings" are more likely to deceive people. The characteristic of "underlying meanings" is that they beat around the bush, appear right but are actually wrong, and mix private interests with public goods.

　　It is said that it is easy to dodge a spear in the open but difficult to guard against an arrow in the dark. In fact, as long as we pay attention to improving our sense of smell and keep our eyes open, those shameful acts that cannot be seen are still easy to identify.

　　Some people are disgusted with "singing praises of virtues."

　　Presumably, this is not without reason. The ruling classes of all dynasties have liked to engage in this trick to gloss over peace.

　　However, today, China has become the China of the people, and merits and virtues are returned to the people. The people sing praises to the great cause they have created and the Communist Party and leaders who centrally represent their interests. This precisely expresses the people's deep love for their own cause. Who says it is not appropriate? Some people don't like it. Examining the reason, I think there can only be one explanation: these people and the vast majority of the people do not breathe in the same way, or even have another kind of emotion in their minds that opposes the people's emotion.

　　There is a kind of argument: since it is mutual supervision, there should be equality.

　　If understanding equality as having an equal attitude and not allowing discrimination is correct, then this requirement is also legitimate.

　　However, some people have another meaning: since it is mutual supervision, no one is bigger than anyone else, so there is no need to talk about leadership. The so-called "political design institute" and the so-called "participating in everything from rehearsal to performance, from design to construction" are, in my opinion, actually born from this major premise.

　　Who is bigger and who is smaller is an objective existence and cannot be determined by any subjective will, so let's put it aside for now. But leadership must be discussed. The constitution has clear provisions, and without this leadership, there is no way to build socialism. Mr. Lu Yuwen's suggestion to abide by three principles when studying party-government relations is, in my opinion, a good suggestion to make some people's minds clear.

　　Now "labels" seem to be out of fashion.

　　It is said that there is such a formula: label = dogmatism.

　　However, it seems difficult to do without labels altogether. For example, some people say: "China is the China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries," and "If the Communist Party is gone, China will not perish. Because even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will not sell out the country," and so on. If you want to summarize these words into a clear concept, you must have a "label."

　　In fact, what we want to oppose is only the indiscriminate labeling that does not proceed from facts and does not add analysis. Indiscriminate labeling is dogmatism.

　　Some people say: "Party rule of the world" is the root of sectarianism.

　　Then someone picks it up and adds: the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root. If it is not fundamentally solved, bureaucracy and sectarianism will increase more and more despite the struggle against them.

　　This continuation makes it much clearer: it turns out that they want to eradicate the root of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

　　Wanting to negate the role of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese revolutionary struggle is nothing new. Looking back at the history of the Chinese revolutionary struggle in the past thirty years or so, all kinds of annihilation theories are still fresh in our memory. The fallacies of some people today to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party are merely a "relapse of an old illness" under new circumstances and new conditions.

　　Past events, if not forgotten, are a guide for the future. Reviewing history will be very helpful for us to understand some phenomena in the current rectification campaign.

　　While everyone is actively offering opinions to help the Communist Party in its rectification campaign, some people are "afraid that the world will not be in chaos." Not allowing counter-criticism and writing anonymous threatening letters are just more blatant typical examples.

　　However, we should deeply believe that the world is not so easy to "fall into chaos." Just look at some protests on the June 8th "People's Daily" that represent the voices of the vast majority of the people, and it is easy to understand this point.

　　暗箭及其他
　　夏之风
　　公开的反动言论比较容易识别，而“弦外之音”则就更容易迷惑人一些。“弦外之音”的特点是：旁敲侧击，似是而非，官货里头夹私货。
    虽说明枪易躲，暗箭难防。其实，只要我们注意提高嗅觉，擦亮眼睛，那些见不得人的无耻勾当还是容易识别的。
    有人对“歌功颂德”有反感。
    想来也不为无因。历代统治阶级都欢喜搞这个玩意儿粉饰太平。
    但是，时至今日，中国成了人民的中国，功德归还人民，人民对于他们手创的伟大事业和集中代表他们利益的共产党与领袖加以歌颂，这正是表达了人民十分热爱自己事业的感情，谁曰不宜？有人看不顺眼，考其原因，我看只能有一种解释，就是这些人和广大人民的呼吸还有不大相通之处，甚至在思想上有反对人民这种感情的另外一种感情在。
    有一种论调：既然是相互监督，就该平起平坐。
    如果把平起平坐理解为要有平等态度，不容有所歧视，这是对的，这个要求也是正当的。
    但是，有的人却是另外一种意思：既然相互监督，就谁也不比谁大，因此也不必谈什么领导不领导。所谓“政治设计院”，所谓“从彩排到演出、从设计到施工都该要参加”，我看实际就是从这条大前提上生下来的。
    谁大谁小，这是客观存在，不是什么主观意志决定得了的，姑置勿论。但是领导不领导却一定要谈，宪法既有明文规定，而没有这个领导也就说不上什么建设社会主义，卢郁文先生建议研究党政关系时要遵守三项原则，我看是一条使    某些人头脑清醒的好建议。
    现在“帽子”好像不行时了。
    据说是这么一条公式：帽子＝教条主义。
    然而，完全没有了帽子好像也很难办，比方，有人说：“中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内”、“共产党亡了，中国不会亡。因为，不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”；等等。你要把这些话概括成为一个明确的概念，势必非有一顶“帽子”不可。
    其实，我们要反对的只是不从事实出发、不加分析的乱戴帽子，乱戴帽子才是教条主义。
    有人说：“党天下”是宗派主义的根源。
    又有人接过来补充说：无产阶级专政是个根，如果不从根本上解决，官僚主义宗派主义将越反越多。
    这一接话就说得明白多了，原来是要铲无产阶级专政之根。
    想否定中国共产党在中国革命斗争中的作用，并不是什么新货色。回溯一下近三十余年来的中国革命斗争史，形形色色的取消论，对我们还是记忆犹新的。现在一些人的取消共产党领导的谬论，只不过是在新形势新条件下面的“老病复发”而已。
    前事不忘，后事之师。重温一下历史，对我们理解当前鸣放中的一些现象是会很有好处的。
    在大家积极提出意见帮助共产党整风的同时，却有人“惟恐天下不乱”。不允许反批评、写匿名恐吓信，只是较为明目张胆的典型一例。
    不过，我们应该深信，天下并不是那么容易“乱”得起来的，只要看一看6月8日“人民日报”上代表了广大人民声音的一些抗议，就很容易想通这一点了。
