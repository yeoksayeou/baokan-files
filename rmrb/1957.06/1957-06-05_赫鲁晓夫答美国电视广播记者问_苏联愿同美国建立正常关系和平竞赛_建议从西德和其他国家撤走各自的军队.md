Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 4th: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev said in a conversation with reporters from the American television broadcasting company "Columbia Broadcasting System" on May 28th that even if a comprehensive agreement on disarmament cannot be reached immediately, the Soviet Union is very willing to solve small problems leading to disarmament with Western countries.

On the issue of Western Europe, Khrushchev once again proposed to the United States and other Western countries that they withdraw their troops from West Germany and other countries, and at the same time, the Soviet Union would also withdraw its troops from East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Romania.

He said that in this way, there would be no more of our troops anywhere else. This is very beneficial and is the first step towards testing sincerity and establishing a good atmosphere without the smell of war. This will also promote the good peaceful relations that can be established between our countries. We have said this in the past, and we repeat it now and are prepared to make all necessary efforts.

This conversation between Khrushchev and "Columbia Broadcasting System" reporters Shauer, Novins, and Cutler took place in his office in the Moscow Kremlin last Tuesday. The conversation has been filmed and broadcast on television stations in New York and Moscow on June 2nd and 3rd respectively. Today, all Moscow newspapers published this conversation in a prominent position.

The conversation lasted for an hour, and the scope of the issues discussed was very wide, from the most concerning world events to Soviet agricultural issues.

Establishing Normal US-Soviet Relations

Novins asked Khrushchev what he thought were the most acute problems that urgently needed to be resolved between the Soviet Union and the United States. He replied that the most important thing was to establish normal relations between countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. In this regard, the most important thing is to start with trade first. The United States should eliminate its "iron curtain," exchange cultural delegations, and strengthen contacts between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as business people.

Khrushchev pointed out that until now, the United States has been pursuing a policy of discrimination against the Soviet Union and is unwilling to trade with it. Although this approach by the United States has not caused much damage to the Soviet Union, it has created a tense atmosphere between the two countries, damaged relations, and created a nervous situation in the world, allowing the mentally disturbed to speculate and scare people with war. This is extremely harmful.

Novins asked if, based on what Khrushchev had just said, it could be concluded that the Soviet Union was prepared to give Western diplomats greater freedom of movement in your country, would no longer interfere with "Voice of America" broadcasts, and would take certain steps as a start to such contact?

Khrushchev said that regarding the issue of restricting the movement of embassy personnel, if a mutual agreement is reached, we will agree to improve and eliminate such restrictions.

Regarding "Voice of America"

Regarding the "Voice of America" issue, our country is a very music-loving country. If we hear good singing, we will not only not interfere with it, but also try our best to amplify the singing and make it resonate throughout the country. However, if others emit unpleasant noises, then everyone will turn off the radio if they can, and if they cannot turn it off, they will interfere with the sound, because the sound is harmful to their hearing. Therefore, if "Voice of America" is the real voice of America, then we will not interfere with it. However, if what is emitted is not the voice of America, but some malicious roar, and if this roar is said to be the voice of America, we do not want the Soviet people to form an incorrect concept of the American people and the voice of the American people.

Peaceful Competition

Novins asked Khrushchev: You say on the one hand that you want to compete in the economic field, but at the same time, why does it seem that you do not allow competition of ideas? Is it that you are making decisions and not letting people decide what they want to listen to?

Khrushchev said: You must know that the attempt to separate us from the people is a cliché, and no one will listen to this tune.

Khrushchev continued, we believe that there is not now, there has not been in the past, and there will not be in the future any government like the Soviet government, no policy like the policy of our Communist Party that conforms to the interests of the Soviet people and the working people of all countries. Therefore, the policy we implement is not only the policy of the Communist Party, but also the policy of the people.

Are we being contradictory when we say that we hope for peaceful competition and that we hope to show the healthiest strength in this competition? We call our system, our socialist system, a healthy strength, because the socialist system is the most progressive and the youngest system. Your grandchildren will also live under the socialist system in the United States.

If we talk about the ideological systems of capitalist and socialist countries, then we do not hide that there will be ideological struggle in this area. However, we have never confused ideological struggle with war. This is an ideological struggle.

Internal Contradictions Among the People

Next, Shauer raised another question. He mentioned Khrushchev's statement above that the Soviet government and the people are inseparable. He said: This statement reminded me of the statement recently published in Beijing, which talked about the possibility of contradictions between the masses and leaders in socialist countries. "Pravda" reprinted this statement. Do Soviet Communists accept this idea? What significance will it have for the Soviet Union?

Khrushchev said: Every country, whether it is socialist or capitalist, has its own development and stages of development. We have been established for forty years; the People's Republic of China has been established for eight years. Therefore, what was necessary for us back then, other socialist countries do not necessarily have to repeat.

The people of each country have their own history and their own customs, and the Communist Party should value these and take them into consideration. Our friends, the Chinese people, have implemented many original proposals in the process of socialist construction. Some proposals are new proposals that take into account China's characteristics, and we believe that this is completely normal and does not violate Marxism-Leninism in the slightest. Therefore, we have published many of these proposals, and in fact, we support them. I say again: each country should proceed from its own conditions and implement what is suitable for itself. This will not offend anyone and does not violate our common Marxist-Leninist views.

Peaceful Coexistence

Cutler asked, (Khrushchev) recently said that the United States is undoubtedly preparing for an anti-Soviet war. Is this view really the basis of Soviet policy?

Khrushchev said: This is not my opinion. I am just repeating what your politicians and your generals have said.

Khrushchev also denied that Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov had ever said anything similar. Khrushchev then said, I do not deny that we have said such things: if American generals and some politicians say that they can destroy the Soviet Union, and if modern technology makes it possible to destroy a country, then the country threatened with destruction can obviously also destroy the other side. In this regard, we do not doubt our own strength. Some people blame me for seeming to have changed my views now, because I once said that if an atomic war breaks out, then capitalism will inevitably be destroyed in this war. I still have to say this now. However, we believe that it is not necessary to eliminate capitalism through war and military conflict, but to eliminate capitalism through ideological and economic struggles.

Khrushchev believes that future wars will not destroy communism. Although war will bring great misfortune to all mankind, humanity will not be wiped out, and human thought will continue to exist, and the thought of Marxism-Leninism is immortal.

Khrushchev said, but war would come at such a huge cost that this means should not be adopted. Therefore, we have to live on the same planet and have to live together. We hope to live peacefully and without war. We believe that we can have friendly relations and live in harmony.

Disarmament

Shauer then asked about disarmament. He said that when the American representatives returned to London to resume disarmament negotiations, they put forward a so-called limited small step on disarmament. He asked Khrushchev if, in his opinion, there was any hope of reaching an agreement on the basis of the current American viewpoint—the initial small step?

Khrushchev said that I do not know yet what steps the United States intends to take, because Stassen has not yet stated his conditions. But we would be satisfied even if the disarmament issue cannot be resolved comprehensively immediately. We agree to start by solving small problems and then move on to big problems.

We have made a lot of efforts to ensure mutual understanding and reach a disarmament agreement with other countries. But until now, neither the United States, Britain, nor France have made corresponding efforts in this regard, which we regret very much.

Stopping Nuclear Weapons Testing

Shauer asked Khrushchev why the Soviet government did not warn in advance, or even announce afterwards, the circumstances of the five recent Soviet tests?

Khrushchev said that this is of no use to people. The issue of registering explosions is a speculative issue. We have raised the fundamental issue—everyone stops explosions. Those who advocate registering explosions are not announcing explosions in advance because they are kind, but because they cannot carry out such explosions on their own territory and have to carry them out on small islands in international waters.

Khrushchev pointed out that the suggestion of registering explosions is just empty talk, and its purpose is to avoid directly answering the question of prohibiting hydrogen weapons, atomic weapons, and prohibiting explosions.

Withdrawing Troops from Other Countries

Novins then mentioned the issue of Western Europe. He asked, in the Soviet government's view, under what conditions would the Soviet Union feel sufficiently secure to withdraw its troops currently stationed in other countries?

Khrushchev said that we are not afraid of anything. We do not want war, but if war is launched against us, then our people will fight with great enthusiasm and loyalty, resolutely defending the motherland.

To prevent war, why don't the United States and other countries withdraw their troops from West Germany and Western countries, that is, from France, Italy, Turkey, and Greece? And we will withdraw our troops from East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Khrushchev also stated that when both sides withdraw their troops, the Soviet Union agrees to inspections on mutual terms.

Khrushchev believes that when talking about reducing armaments, we must trust each other and not regard each other as plunderers.

Cutler asked Khrushchev if he was worried that if Soviet troops withdrew from Eastern Europe, those countries would no longer be communist countries.

Khrushchev replied that this is nonsense. The communist system should be based on the will of the people. If the people do not want this system, let them establish the system they like. So we will boldly withdraw our troops from all stationed countries and are convinced that the people of these countries will better defend their system.

Shauer asked Khrushchev if he believed that in every country with a communist regime, the regime is now based on the will of the people?

Khrushchev said absolutely. You see, what means did Chiang Kai-shek use to keep the Chinese people in Taiwan in his hands? Americans spent six billion dollars intending to keep Chiang Kai-shek on the mainland. But what was the result? All the weapons that Chiang Kai-shek received from the Americans were given to Mao Zedong's China. Who did it? The people did it, because the Chiang Kai-shek regime did not conform to the wishes of the Chinese people, so this regime perished.

Shauer said that since Khrushchev mentioned the unpleasant things that happened to the United States in Taiwan, then he would like to ask, if there were no Soviet troops and tanks in Hungary, how long could the Kadar regime exist?

Khrushchev said, let us try it, you withdraw troops from Germany and France, and we withdraw troops from Germany, Poland, and Hungary, and we will see that the Kadar regime will prosper and become strong forever. Where the working class has already seized power, the working class will never give up its power to the exploiters, but will consolidate this power and develop its economy and culture.

Novins also asked what steps the Soviet government currently intends to take to gradually achieve a deeper understanding between all countries in the world?

Khrushchev said that the fundamental suggestion we have put forward is that we have put forward our own disarmament plan; we suggest that trade restrictions be lifted now; we suggest that the United States dismantle the "iron curtain" and widely exchange delegations of various natures and professions. I think that this is enough to start with. If the United States also has the same attitude, then we will make great progress.

Novins then asked Khrushchev if he believed that the history since the end of the war gave reason to believe that the Soviet Union had done something wrong in some cases or made mistakes in international relations, and that these errors had generated some sources of tension?

Khrushchev said that I imagine that errors may have occurred on both sides. If the disputes that are currently occurring are resolved wisely, perhaps tensions will not arise.

Soviet Livestock Products and Wheat Production

In this conversation, Khrushchev also talked about the reporter's questions about the Soviet Union's plan to catch up with the United States in the production of livestock products such as milk and meat per capita in the next few years, and his estimates of this year's Soviet wheat harvest.

When talking about this year's Soviet wheat harvest, Khrushchev pointed out that last year's Soviet harvest was very good, but this bumper harvest was only the result of increased wheat production in Siberia and Kazakhstan. And this year, the situation will be even better than last year, because not only Siberia and Kazakhstan, but also the winter wheat in Ukraine and the central states of the Russian Federation are growing very well this year.

    赫鲁晓夫答美国电视广播记者问
    苏联愿同美国建立正常关系和平竞赛
    建议从西德和其他国家撤走各自的军队
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫5月28日在一次同美国电视广播公司“哥伦比亚广播公司”的记者谈话时说，在裁军问题上即使不能立即全面达成协议，苏联也非常愿意同西方国家解决走向裁军的小问题。
    在西欧问题上，赫鲁晓夫再一次向美国和其他西方国家提出，要他们从西德和其他国家撤走自己的军队，同时苏联也将从东德、波兰、匈牙利和罗马尼亚撤军。
    他说，这样一来，在其他国家任何地方再也没有我们的军队了。这是非常有好处的，也是为检验诚意和建立没有战争臭味的良好气氛的第一步。这还会促进我们国家之间所能够建立起来的和平的良好关系。过去我们说过，现在我们还重复这点并且准备作出一切必要的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫同“哥伦比亚广播公司”记者绍尔、诺文斯和卡特勒作的这次谈话，是上星期二在莫斯科克里姆林宫他的办公室进行的。谈话的经过已经被拍成了影片，并且在6月2日和3日分别在纽约和莫斯科的电视台上放映。今天莫斯科各报都以显著地位刊载了这篇谈话。
    这次谈话共进行了一小时，所谈到的问题的范围非常广泛，从目前最令人关心的世界大事一直到苏联的农业问题。
    建立美苏正常关系
    诺文斯问赫鲁晓夫，他认为目前苏联和美国之间急需解决的最尖锐的问题是什么？他回答说，最主要的是：各国间建立正常关系，首先是美国和苏联之间建立正常关系。在这一方面，最主要的是应该首先从贸易开始，美国应该消除自己的“铁幕”，应该交换文化代表团；加强苏美两国人民以及商界人士间的接触。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，直到现在，美国还在执行着歧视苏联的政策，不愿同它进行贸易。尽管美国这种作法对苏联并没有造成多大的损害，但是它却在两国之间造成紧张空气，把关系弄坏，并且形成世界上神经过敏的局面，也使精神失常的人可以利用战争进行投机和吓人。这是极其有害的。
    诺文斯问，根据赫鲁晓夫刚才所说的话，是否可以得出这样的结论：苏联准备予西方的外交人员在你国行动更大的自由，将不再干扰“美国之音”的广播？并且将采取某些步骤作为那种接触的开端？
    赫鲁晓夫说，关于限制大使馆人员行动的问题，如果相互取得协议，我们将同意改善和取消这种限制。
    关于“美国之音”
    关于“美国之音”的问题，我们的国家是非常爱好音乐的国家。假如我们听到的是好歌声，我们不但不干扰它，而且竭力扩大这歌声，使它响彻全国。但是，假如别人发出来的是不悦耳的怪调，那末，能够关上收音机的话人人都会关上的，假如不能够关上，他也会干扰这种声音，因为这种声音对他的听觉有害。因此，假如“美国之音”是真正的美国的声音，那我们是不会干扰它的。但是，如果发出来的不是美国的声音，而是某种恶意的叫吼，假如把这种叫吼说成是美国之音的话，我们不愿意苏联人民对美国人民和美国人民的声音形成不正确的概念。
    和平竞赛
    诺文斯问赫鲁晓夫：您一方面说要在经济方面竞赛，但是同时，为什么好像又不容许思想竞赛，这是不是有矛盾。是你在作出决定而不让人们决定他们愿意听什么吧。
    赫鲁晓夫说：你们要知道，想把我们同人民分割开来的做法是一种陈腔滥调，谁也不会听这种调子的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们认为，现在没有，过去没有，将来也不会有哪一个政府像苏联政府那样，没有谁的政策像我们共产党的政策那样符合苏联人民和所有国家劳动人民的利益。因此我们实行的政策不仅是共产党的政策，也就是人民的政策。
    我们说，我们希望和平竞赛，我们希望在这种竞赛中显出最健康的力量，这种说法是不是有矛盾呢。我们把我们的制度，我们的社会主义制度叫做健康力量，因为社会主义制度是最进步、最年青的制度。你们的孙子也将在美国的社会主义制度下生活。
    如果谈到资本主义国家和社会主义国家的思想体系，那么我们不掩饰，这方面将有思想斗争。但是，我们从来没有把意识形态的斗争同战争混为一谈。这是思想上的斗争。
    人民内部矛盾
    接着，绍尔又提出了另一个问题。他提到了赫鲁晓夫在上面的谈话中曾经说过的苏联政府同人民是不可分割的一段谈话。他说：这段话使我想起了不久前在北京发表的声明，声明中谈到，在社会主义国家里，群众和领导者之间可能存在着矛盾。“真理报”转载了这个声明，苏联共产党人是否接受这种思想？它对苏联将有什么意义？
    赫鲁晓夫说：每个国家，不管它是社会主义国家还是资本主义国家，都有自己的发展和发展阶段。我们已经建立了四十年；中华人民共和国建立了八年。因此当年对我们来讲是必要的东西，其他社会主义国家就不一定要去重复。
    每个国家的人民都有自己的历史，自己的习惯，而共产党应当重视这些并且加以考虑。我们的朋友中国人民在社会主义建设的过程中实施了很多独创的主张。有些主张是考虑到中国的特点的新主张，我们认为这是完全正常的，丝毫也不违背马克思列宁主义。因此，其中很多主张我们都予以登载，实际上我们是加以支持的。我再说一遍：每个国家都应当根据自己的条件出发，对于自己适合的就加以实施。这不会得罪任何人并且也不违背我们共同的马克思列宁主义观点。
    和平共处
    卡特勒问，（赫鲁晓夫）不久前说过，美国无疑正在准备反苏战争。这种看法真的是苏联政策的基础吗？
    赫鲁晓夫说：这不是我的意见。我只是在重复你们的政治家、你们的将军们所说过的话。
    赫鲁晓夫也否认苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅曾经说过类似的话。接着赫鲁晓夫说，我不否认，我们曾经说过这样的话：如果美国将军们和某些政治家们说，他们能够毁灭苏联，假如现代的技术有可能毁灭一个国家的话，那末，遭到毁灭威胁的国家显然也可以毁灭对方。在这方面，我们对自己的力量是不怀疑的。某些人责备我说我现在好像改变了观点，因为，有一次我说，如果爆发原子战争的话，那么在这个战争中毁灭的必是资本主义。我现在也还要这样说。但是，我们认为，不必通过战争和军事冲突来消灭资本主义，而要通过意识形态和经济战线上的斗争来消灭资本主义。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，未来的战争不会毁灭共产主义。虽然战争会给全人类带来巨大的不幸，可是人类不会被消灭，人类的思想也会存在下去，而马克思列宁主义的思想是不朽的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，但是战争要付出如此巨大的代价，因此不应该采取这个手段。因此，我们得生活在同一个星球上，不得不共同生活下去。我们希望和平地、没有战争地生活下去。我们认为，我们可以有友好联系，可以和睦相处。裁　军
    绍尔接着问到裁军问题。他说，美国代表回到伦敦重新进行裁军谈判的时候提出了一个关于裁军的所谓有限制的小步骤。他问赫鲁晓夫，在他看来，在目前美国观点——最初的一小步的基础上达成协议有什么希望没有？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我现在还不知道美国打算采取哪些步骤，因为史塔生还没有把自己的条件说出来。但是裁军问题即使不能立即全面解决我们也会满意的。我们同意由解决小问题开始然后再转入大问题。
    为了确保互相谅解并且同其他国家达成裁军协议，我们作了不少努力。但直到目前为止，无论美国、英国和法国都没有在这方面作相应的努力，这使我们感到很遗憾。停止核武器试验
    绍尔问赫鲁晓夫，苏联政府为什么不在事先警告，甚至不在事后宣布苏联最近进行的五次试验的情况？
    赫鲁晓夫说，这对人没有什么用。登记爆炸的问题是个投机性质的问题。我们提出了根本性的问题——大家都停止爆炸。那些主张登记爆炸的人并不是因为他善良而预先宣布爆炸，而是因为他们自己的领土不能进行这种爆炸，而不得不在公海上的小岛上进行爆炸。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，某些人提出登记爆炸的建议，不过是空谈，其目的是为了回避直接回答关于禁止氢武器、原子武器和禁止爆炸的问题。从其他国家撤退军队
    诺文斯接着提到了西欧问题。他问道，按照苏联政府的看法，苏联在什么样的条件下才感到有充分的安全来把它现在驻在别国的军队撤回？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们什么也不害怕。我们不希望战争，但是，如果对我们发动战争，那么我们的人民将抱着极大热情和忠忱去作战，坚决捍卫祖国。
    为了防止战争，为什么美国和其他国家不把自己的军队从西德和西方国家，即从法国、意大利、土耳其和希腊撤出呢？而我们会从东德、波兰、匈牙利和罗马尼亚撤出自己的军队的。赫鲁晓夫还表示，在双方撤军的时候，苏联同意在相互条件下进行视察。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，当谈到裁减军备的时候，要相互信任，不要彼此把对方看作掠夺者。
    卡特勒问赫鲁晓夫是否耽心如果苏联军队撤出东欧的话，那些国家就不会再是共产主义国家了。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，这是无稽之谈。共产主义制度应当以人民的意志为基础，假如人民不要这种制度，就让他们建立他们喜欢的制度。所以我们将大胆地把自己的军队从所有驻扎的国家撤出，并且深信这些国家的人民将更好地保卫自己的制度。
    绍尔问赫鲁晓夫，他是否相信现在每一个有共产主义政权的国家内，政权都奠定在人民意志的基础上？
    赫鲁晓夫说绝对是这样的。你们看，蒋介石是用什么手段把在台湾的中国人民掌握在自己的手中。美国人曾经花费了六十亿美元打算把蒋介石保持在大陆上。但结果怎么样呢？蒋介石从美国人手中得到的武器全部都送给了毛泽东的中国，是谁干的？人民干的，因为蒋介石政权不符合中国人民的意愿，所以这个政权灭亡了。
    绍尔说，既然赫鲁晓夫提起了在台湾发生的使美国不愉快的事，那么，他想问一下，如果在匈牙利没有苏联军队和坦克，卡达尔政权能存在多久？
    赫鲁晓夫说，让我们试试看，你们从德国、法国撤退军队，我们从德国、波兰、匈牙利撤退军队，我们就会看到，卡达尔政权会永远繁荣和富强。在工人阶级已经取得政权的地方，工人阶级就决不会是把自己政权让给剥削者，而是要巩固这个政权，发展自己的经济和文化。
    诺文斯还问，苏联政府目前打算采取什么步骤来争取世界上各国之间逐渐取得更深的谅解？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们提出的根本性建议就是，我们提出了自己的裁军计划；我们建议现在就取消贸易限制；我们建议美国拆除“铁幕”和广泛地交换各种性质和专业的代表团。我想，以此作为开始已经够了。如果美国也抱同样态度的话，那末我们就会取得很大的进展。
    诺文斯又问赫鲁晓夫是否认为，战争结束后的历史使人有根据认为在某些情况下苏联是做得不对的或者在国际关系中犯了错误，而这些错误产生了紧张局势的某些根源？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我设想错误可能是双方面都有过的。如果明智地来解决目前发生的争执问题，或许不致会产生紧张局势。
    苏联畜产品和小麦生产
    在这次谈话中，赫鲁晓夫还谈到了记者提出的关于苏联计划在最近几年间在按人口平均计算牛奶、肉类等畜产品的产量方面赶上美国的问题，以及他对今年苏联小麦的收成的估计的问题。
    在谈到今年苏联小麦的收成的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，去年苏联的收成很好，但是这次丰收只是西伯利亚和哈萨克的小麦产量增加的结果。而在今年，情况还会比去年好，这因为，不但是西伯利亚和哈萨克，就是乌克兰和俄罗斯联邦中部各州的冬小麦今年也都长得非常好。
