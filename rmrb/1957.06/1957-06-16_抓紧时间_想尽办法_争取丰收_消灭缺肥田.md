Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: Farmers in various parts of Hunan Province are striving for a bumper harvest this year, seizing the opportunity to eliminate fertilizer-deficient fields and launching a crash campaign for summer fertilizer accumulation. Currently, approximately one million people across the province are engaged daily in activities such as cutting green grass, fermenting green manure, and increasing the accumulation of soil fertilizer. According to statistics from 4,167 agricultural cooperatives in eleven counties and cities of the Xiangtan Special District, as of the end of May, a total of over 15 million dan of various fertilizers had been accumulated. In Guzhang and Fenghuang counties, over 4 million dan of green manure were accumulated in just over half a month. In Longhui County and Chengbu Miao Autonomous County, the problem of fertilizer deficiency has been basically solved after cutting green grass.

According to inspections, rice crops in Hunan Province this year, whether in lake areas or hilly and mountainous regions, are generally growing well. The rice seedlings in the fields are a lush green, already tillering and closing the rows; cotton seedlings are also two or three inches tall. Some experienced farmers say: If things continue like this, there is a good chance of achieving a bumper harvest this year. However, inspections in various areas have revealed a serious problem: some fields lack fertilizer or have not been fertilized at all. The rice seedlings in these fields are yellow and thin, with little tillering. The main reasons for the lack of fertilizer or no fertilizer are the drought last winter, which resulted in a shortage of fertilizer sources. Secondly, some agricultural cooperatives failed to adequately resolve the contradiction between fertilizing distant and nearby fields, and subjectively planted rice seedlings too early, resulting in some fields being planted without any fertilizer. Many agricultural cooperatives have these fertilizer-deficient and unfertilized fields, and the situation is even more prevalent in cooperatives and production teams with lagging work. After discovering this problem, the local CPC committees immediately mobilized farmers to launch a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign and, in conjunction with democratic management of the cooperatives, carried out a crash rectification of some cooperatives and production teams with lagging work. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various areas are not only vigorously accumulating fertilizer but also rushing to apply topdressing fertilizer. Supply and marketing cooperatives are also supplying a batch of commercial fertilizers from their stocks to agricultural cooperatives to eliminate fertilizer-deficient and unfertilized rice fields.

### 抓紧时间　想尽办法　争取丰收  消灭缺肥田

　　抓紧时间　想尽办法　争取丰收
　　消灭缺肥田
    新华社长沙电　湖南省各地农民力争今年大丰收，抓住消灭缺肥田而突击开展夏季积肥运动。现在，全省每天约有一百多万人投入割青草、沤绿肥和增积土肥等活动。据湘潭专区十一个县、市的四千一百六十七个农业社到5月底的统计，共积有各种肥料一千五百多万担。古丈、凤凰等县半个多月内就积了四百多万担绿肥。隆回县和城步苗族自治县割青草后，缺肥问题已基本解决。
    据检查，今年湖南省无论在湖区或丘陵山区，稻禾一般都生长良好，田野里一片绿油油的稻苗已发蔸封行；棉苗也长有两、三寸高了。一些老农说：像这样下去，争取今年丰收很有希望。但各地在检查中发现当前存在着一个严重的问题，就是有些田缺少肥料或根本没有下一点肥料。这些田里的稻苗长得又黄又瘦，不大发蔸。缺肥和无肥的主要原因是，去年冬旱，缺少肥源。其次，有些农业社未能很好解决远田和近田施肥的矛盾，以及主观提早插秧等，以致有些田没有施一点肥料就插了秧。这种缺肥和无肥的田，许多农业社都有，工作落后的社和生产队更多一些。各地中共党委在发现这个问题后，立即发动农民开展夏季积肥运动，并结合民主办社，突击整顿一些工作落后的社和生产队。现在，各地农业社除大力积肥外，还赶紧追肥。供销社也把存有的一批商品肥料供应给农业社，用于消灭缺肥和无肥的稻田。
