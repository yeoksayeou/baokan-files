　　Odds and Ends
    New Zealand's kiwi bird – the apteryx – is wingless and tailless, covered in soft feathers, shaped like a ball of flowers, and uses its long beak as a third leg. It likes to sleep during the day and searches for earthworms at night. The large kiwi and the small kiwi appear to be the same size, but the large kiwi weighs eight times as much as the small kiwi. Female kiwis often lay eggs only once every year or two, and the male kiwi incubates the eggs, generally for 75 days, before the chicks hatch. The egg is about five inches long and weighs about one pound.
