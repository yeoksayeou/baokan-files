    The Quality of Shanghai Salted Eggs and Preserved Eggs Has Declined
    In the past two years, the quality of salted eggs and preserved eggs supplied in the Shanghai market has not been as good as before. Consumers have reported that the salted eggs sold on the market now are not salty enough, and good salted eggs with red yolks and plenty of oil are nowhere to be found. Tender preserved eggs are also unavailable. What is the reason for this? Relevant commercial departments in Shanghai are currently studying this matter.
    Before 1954, there were more than 50 stores in Shanghai processing salted eggs and preserved eggs. These egg merchants generally paid attention to quality when processing salted eggs and preserved eggs. At the same time, they all had certain experience. For example, before processing, they had to distinguish the origin of the fresh eggs and then process them into salted eggs or preserved eggs separately.
    After the transformation of private egg merchants in 1954, due to the relevant departments' lack of attention to the past egg merchants' business and processing experience, only two processors remained, and the state-owned processing business failed to develop accordingly, resulting in a shortage of supply in the market. In order to meet market demand, salted eggs and preserved eggs were transferred in large quantities from other places. However, eggs processed in other places are generally inferior to those processed by Shanghai egg merchants, so the quality of salted eggs and preserved eggs in Shanghai is not as good as before.
    Recently, relevant departments in Shanghai are studying the experience of the original private egg merchants in processing salted eggs and preserved eggs, and are combining the current subjective and objective conditions to improve work and improve the quality of salted eggs and preserved eggs. ·Shi Rongzhang·

    上海咸、皮蛋质量下降了
    近两年来，上海市场上供应的咸蛋、皮蛋的质量不如过去好了。消费者反映说：现在市场上卖的咸蛋不咸，且不见红黄多油的好咸蛋了。嫩皮蛋也买不到了。这是什么原因呢？上海有关的商业部门最近正在研究这件事。
    1954年以前，上海加工咸蛋、皮蛋的商店共有五十多家，这些蛋商加工咸蛋、皮蛋一般都讲究质量。同时都有一定的经验。如在加工前，先要分清鲜蛋的产地，再分别加工咸蛋或皮蛋。
    1954年私营蛋商进行改造以后，由于有关部门对过去蛋商的经营和加工经验不够重视，加工商只剩下两家了，而国营加工业务又未能相应发展，以致市场上产生了供应不足的现象。为了满足市场需要，就从外埠大量调入咸蛋和皮蛋。但是外地加工的蛋，一般都比上海蛋商加工的差，因此上海的咸蛋、皮蛋的质量不如以前了。
    最近，上海市有关部门正在研究原有私营蛋商加工咸、皮蛋的经验，并结合当前主客观的条件，来改进工作，提高咸蛋、皮蛋的质量。　·施荣章·
