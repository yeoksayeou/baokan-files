    Stop the U.S. Conspiracy in Korea

    On May 30, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, issued a statement condemning the United States for attempting to bring new weapons into South Korea. The statement pointed out that the U.S. aim in doing so was to undermine the armistice agreement, fuel the Lee Syngman clique's aggressive actions, and perpetuate the U.S. military occupation of South Korea. Foreign Minister Nam Il warned the United States about the grave consequences that could arise from this conspiracy. We fully support the solemn position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Since the realization of the Korean armistice, there has been a struggle between two lines on the issue of maintaining the stability of the Korean armistice and achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean and Chinese side has consistently and resolutely abided by the various provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and has made multifaceted efforts to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, so that the current armistice state can be transformed into a lasting peace. The United States, however, has been trying to undermine the provisions of the armistice agreement. It has actively strengthened and expanded the military power of the Lee Syngman clique, violated the airspace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, obstructed the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, refused to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and attempted to permanently divide Korea. This practice by the United States has created obstacles to the peaceful reunification of Korea and has become a factor threatening peace in the Far East and Asia.

    The United States' goal of obstructing the realization of lasting peace in Korea is to maintain a source of tension here so that it can be used at any time. The recent international situation has continued to move toward detente, which the United States is unwilling to see. In order to maintain tension in Asia, the United States has taken measures to deploy missile units in Taiwan, China, and attempted to bring new weapons into South Korea, turning the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into an atomic force. Obviously, the United States wants to create new tensions in Korea by undermining the armistice agreement, in order to obstruct the trend of detente in Asia.

    However, the Korean Armistice Agreement must not be undermined. Atomic weapons cannot intimidate the Korean and Chinese people. The presence of atomic weapons in South Korea by the United States would undoubtedly have very serious consequences. The "allies" of the United States must now seriously consider the disasters that this intention of the United States may bring to them, and have a responsibility to stop the adventurous behavior of the United States as soon as possible. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was not only the result of the efforts of the Korean and Chinese people for peace in Korea, but also the result of the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world. If the U.S. aggressor groups dare to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, they will inevitably encounter the resolute opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, including the American people. We, the Chinese people, will stand with the Korean people and wage a resolute struggle to stop the U.S. conspiracy to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.

### 制止美国在朝鲜的阴谋

    制止美国在朝鲜的阴谋
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在5月30日发表声明，谴责美国企图把新武器运进南朝鲜。声明指出，美国这样做的目的是要破坏停战协定，助长李承晚集团的侵略行为，把美军对南朝鲜的占领永久化。南日外务相对美国这个阴谋可能引起的严重后果向美国提出了警告。我们完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这种严正的立场。
    从朝鲜停战实现以来，在维持朝鲜停战稳定和实现朝鲜和平统一的问题上，一直存在着两条路线的斗争。朝中方面一贯坚决遵守朝鲜停战协定的各项条款，并且为促进朝鲜的和平统一，使目前的停战状态能转变为持久和平，作了多方面的努力。而美国方面却处心积虑地破坏停战协定的条款。它积极加强和扩充李承晚集团的军事力量，侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领空，阻挠中立国监察委员会的活动，拒绝从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，企图永久分裂朝鲜。美国方面的这种做法，给朝鲜的和平统一制造了障碍，并且成为威胁远东和亚洲和平的一个因素。
    美国阻挠在朝鲜实现持久和平的目的，就是要在这里保持一个紧张局势的根源，以便它随时加以利用。最近国际局势继续趋向和缓，这是美国不愿意看到的。美国为了在亚洲保持紧张局面，就采取了在中国的台湾派驻导弹部队的措施，并且企图把新式武器运进南朝鲜，使驻扎在南朝鲜的美军成为原子部队。显然，美国想通过破坏停战协定，在朝鲜制造新的紧张，以阻挠亚洲局势趋向和缓。
    但是，朝鲜停战协定决不容许破坏。原子武器决不能吓倒朝中人民。美国如在南朝鲜拥有原子武器，无疑地将引起十分严重的后果。美国的“盟国”们现在必须认真考虑美国这种打算可能给它们带来的灾难，并有责任及早制止美国的冒险行为。朝鲜停战协定的签订，不仅是朝中两国人民为朝鲜和平而努力的结果，也是全世界爱好和平的人民努力的结果。如果美国侵略集团竟敢破坏朝鲜停战协定，它就必然要遭到包括美国人民在内的全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决反对。我们中国人民，将同朝鲜人民在一起，为制止美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋而进行坚决的斗争。
