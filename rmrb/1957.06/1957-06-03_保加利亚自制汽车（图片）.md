Bulgarian Homemade Car

The first domestically produced small car of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has been manufactured. It was created by the design bureau of the Twelfth Factory Collective and is therefore named "Sofia-12." This newborn can travel eighty kilometers per hour and consumes three liters of gasoline per hundred kilometers. It weighs two hundred and fifty kilograms and the engine is capable of fourteen horsepower. The motor is mounted in the rear; a tube leading to the front of the car supplies air to cool it. The luggage compartment is in the front of the car. The car can seat four people. When the two rear seats are not in use, they are covered with a specially made top, making the entire car look particularly beautiful.

    保加利亚自制汽车
    保加利亚人民共和国的第一辆国产小汽车已经制成，它是由第十二工厂集体设计局创制的，因此命名为“索非亚—12”。这个初生儿每小时能跑八十公里，每百公里耗汽油三公升。车重二百五十公斤，发动机能是十四马力。马达装在车后；通到汽车头部的管子送来空气，使它冷却。行李舱在汽车前部。车中可乘坐四人。后面两个座位在不使用的时候，就用特制的顶子盖起来，使得整个汽车显得特别美观。
