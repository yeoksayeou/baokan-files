　　Beijing, June 13th. (Reporter of this Newspaper) The China Democratic League Central Committee group held its fourth symposium last night. Obviously, some members of the China Democratic League, especially some responsible persons of the China Democratic League, have recently made some erroneous remarks, and the China Democratic League Central Committee has not expressed a clear attitude towards these erroneous remarks, which has aroused unusual concern and great dissatisfaction among the broad masses of League members and members of the Central Committee of the League. Therefore, the Central Committee members, alternate Central Committee members, and staff members of the League Central Committee who attended the meeting last night were particularly enthusiastic, and the number was almost doubled compared with the previous meeting. The meeting exceptionally started from 8 o'clock and lasted until 11 o'clock, and it proceeded in a very warm and very tense atmosphere. When the meeting was announced to be over, some people who had signed up to speak had not yet had the opportunity to speak. At the meeting, Central Committee members Luo Hanxian, Central Standing Committee member Ye Duyi, Vice Chairman Shi Liang, Central Committee member Qian Jiaju, alternate Central Committee member Tao Dayong, Central Committee member Luo Ziwei, Central Committee member Zhang Bilai, Central Standing Committee members Hu Yuzhi, Deng Chumin, and alternate Central Committee member Zhang Jiyu all focused on criticizing the erroneous remarks of China Democratic League Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, alternate Central Committee member Chen Xingui, China Democratic League member Chu Anping, and others. They unanimously demanded that the China Democratic League Central Committee should clearly express its attitude towards these erroneous remarks, and demanded that the China Democratic League Central Committee and members of the China Democratic League must ideologically draw a clear line between themselves and such anti-socialist remarks. Otherwise, it would be impossible to coexist with the Communist Party on the basis of socialism for a long time. Therefore, Deng Chumin suggested in his speech that an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee should be convened immediately to solve this problem. Finally, Guo Zecheng, a member of the Central Standing Committee who presided over the meeting, said that he would suggest that the Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League immediately consider it.
　　At the meeting, Central Standing Committee member Ye Duyi and alternate Central Committee member Chen Xingui also made self-criticisms of some of the erroneous remarks they had made. The speakers welcomed Ye Duyi's self-criticism, but were still extremely dissatisfied with Chen Xingui's self-criticism, believing that he did not fundamentally recognize the seriousness of his mistakes ideologically, and criticized his speech today again. Central Committee member Xian Ying also spoke at the meeting.
　　Luo Hanxian said: Right-wing remarks are an attack on the Party, the country, and socialism
　　Luo Hanxian said that the remarks of a few right-wing elements, whether in terms of their nature, purpose, or the method of raising questions, are a political problem of challenging socialism, challenging the state and regime of the proletarian dictatorship, challenging the Communist Party, and challenging the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China. Some people believe that it is unimaginable that Chu Anping dared to make such reactionary remarks without strong support behind him. Therefore, he advocated that the China Democratic League Central Committee must clearly state that it draws a line between itself and Chu Anping.
　　Then he criticized Chu Anping and Chen Xingui. He believed that these two people were the most prominent representatives of these absurd, erroneous, and reactionary remarks.
　　He said that the few right-wing elements who believe that the leadership of the Communist Party is "the Party's world" and who deny the proletarian dictatorship are essentially anti-socialist. He said that Chen Xingui listed many facts as examples of sectarianism in his speech, such as implementing the Party's policies through Party members, giving play to the role of activists as assistants, paying attention to political conditions when appointing cadres, selecting students studying abroad by paying attention to political qualities, and the working class cultivating intellectuals of its own class, etc. In fact, these are all completely correct things and are necessary measures to implement and embody the proletarian dictatorship. These measures have nothing in common with the sectarianism we oppose.
　　In his speech, Luo Hanxian finally criticized Zhang Bojun and others. He said that the main error in Zhang Bojun's opinion lies in the fact that the political design institute he advocated is in conflict with the Party's leadership principle; this design institute is above the Party and the National People's Congress, so it is wrong. The main error in Luo Longji's opinion lies in the fact that the rehabilitation committee he advocated should be separated from the original Party-led Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries leading organs, which shows his suspicion of the Party's leadership; the main error of Comrade Ye Duyi lies in the fact that his opinion essentially cancels the Party's leadership in schools and even in all state organs. These opinions are serious in nature.
　　Ye Duyi made a review, saying that he felt ashamed of the harmful effects of his erroneous remarks
　　Ye Duyi made a self-criticism of his own erroneous remarks at the meeting. He said: The erroneous remarks I made at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee have had harmful effects in society and have also caused certain losses to the prestige of the China Democratic League itself. I feel very ashamed and distressed.
　　Then, he conducted a preliminary analysis and criticism of his own erroneous remarks. He said:
　　First of all, I think it is extremely wrong to believe that party relations should not be emphasized in schools, organs, and enterprises, and that the role of party organizations, including the Communist Party of China, should not be emphasized. On the one hand, I admit that the Party needs to lead in terms of general policies and policies at the national and provincial levels, but on the other hand, I think that the role of Party organizations in various business units can be reduced. This actually puts the Party's leadership in the air and cannot be grounded. In fact, the Party's general policies and policies need to be put into practice through various business units. Therefore, to ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and policies, it is necessary to strengthen rather than reduce the core leadership role of the Party in various units.
　　Ye Duyi used an example from his own work post to illustrate this point. He said: I am responsible for part of the administrative leadership in my work post. I often feel that the Party branch of that organ lacks the strength to ensure the completion of administrative tasks, and I have no better reliance than the Party branch to contact the masses and implement administrative tasks. Therefore, the opinion I put forward to the Party at the rectification meeting of my organ was that the Party organization was too weak and should be strengthened. This shows that my own business practice gives my subjective ideas a strong refutation.
　　Then, he criticized his proposed erroneous statement that "in state organs, having party organizational activities, one more identity means one more relationship, and one more opportunity to produce contradictions." He said that this view is also extremely wrong. From a Marxist point of view, the existence of contradictions within things is a universal and eternal phenomenon. The erroneous remarks that have appeared in the current great rectification movement - my remarks are one of them, the anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary remarks of a few right-wing elements, and the despicable reactionary acts of a very small number of hidden counter-revolutionaries who send anonymous threatening letters, all show that contradictions exist and are quite intense. Class struggle, especially ideological class struggle, has become indispensable. Of course, apart from the sabotage activities of a very small number of counter-revolutionaries, it should be said that the majority are still contradictions among the people. The existence of political parties reflects reality and is for the purpose of better resolving these contradictions, and will never produce contradictions.
　　Ye Duyi also criticized his proposed erroneous argument that democratic parties do not need to establish grassroots organizations and do not need to have organizational life. He said that this idea is neither in line with the requirements of party members nor does it violate the spiritual essence of socialist-type democratic parties. Socialist democratic parties have a major responsibility to educate and ideologically transform their members so that they can smoothly transition to becoming genuine working people and working intellectuals. If grassroots organizations are not established and organizational life is not carried out, how can political and ideological education be carried out?
　　Ye Duyi believes that the bourgeois ideology of the old reactionary set from the old society will come out at any time. My erroneous thoughts and remarks fully illustrate this point. The ideological transformation of intellectuals is a long-term and arduous process. Therefore, strengthening political and ideological education has become the primary and long-term task of democratic parties. On the one hand, I want to step up my own self-ideological transformation, and on the other hand, I also warmly request the League organization to help me.
　　Finally, Ye Duyi criticized Zhang Bojun's proposal of a political design institute, Luo Longji's proposal to establish a rehabilitation committee, and the fallacies of Chu Anping, Chen Xingui, and others.
　　Deng Chumin believes that the problems existing in the China Democratic League must be fundamentally solved in order to coexist with the Communist Party for a long time
　　Deng Chumin said in his speech: The People's Daily's report entitled "Noteworthy Trends of the China Democratic League" and the request of the Fudan University Branch of the China Democratic League in Shanghai that the China Democratic League Central Committee express its attitude towards the recent many erroneous remarks of members of the China Democratic League are all worthy of our attention. Deng Chumin said that the erroneous remarks of members of the China Democratic League accounted for the majority among the various democratic parties, but the people who made the erroneous remarks should be responsible for this, and their erroneous remarks cannot represent the China Democratic League. Otherwise, he believes that other democratic parties can "coexist with the Communist Party for a long time," but the China Democratic League cannot "coexist with the Communist Party for a long time." Therefore, Deng Chumin suggested that an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee should be convened immediately to discuss whether these erroneous remarks represent individuals or the China Democratic League.
　　Deng Chumin continued: This rectification movement has just begun, but the shortcomings of intellectuals have been exposed a lot. Socialism wants to transform agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. I think these transformation problems are not big, but the transformation of intellectuals is still a problem. And the China Democratic League is working on intellectuals. Therefore, I suggest convening an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee to fundamentally solve the problems existing in the China Democratic League.
　　Deng Chumin finally said: There will definitely be enemies taking advantage of loopholes in helping the Communist Party to rectify the work style. This is a struggle between the vast majority of the people and a very small number of counter-revolutionaries, and our China Democratic League must pay attention to it.
　　Qian Jiaju said: Chu Anping represents some people who want to "gain something" in the rectification movement, and there are many people in the China Democratic League who support him
　　Qian Jiaju said that after studying at the Socialist Academy, Chen Xingui not only did not transform his thinking well, but instead found some dogmas as a basis for opposing socialism. Chen Xingui's mistake lies in confusing the proletarian dictatorship with the Communist Party's dictatorship. The proletarian dictatorship is realized through the leadership of the proletarian vanguard, that is, the Communist Party, but it does not mean that the proletarian dictatorship is the Communist Party's dictatorship. If it is the Communist Party's dictatorship, then it is the dictatorship of Communist Party members over non-Communist Party members, and the dictatorship of Communist Party members in the working class over non-Communist Party members in the working class. Marxism-Leninism has never equated these two, which is the bourgeoisie's slander against the Communist Party. But Chen Xingui actually took up the bourgeoisie's weapon to oppose us.
　　Qian Jiaju then explained why the people's democratic dictatorship is essentially the proletarian dictatorship, explaining that there is not much experience in the proletarian dictatorship, and some mistakes are inevitable, but we must not negate the proletarian dictatorship because of this. According to Chen Xingui's logic, to oppose the three isms, we must abolish the proletarian dictatorship. At the same time, the past dictatorships, namely the bourgeois dictatorship and the feudal landlord dictatorship, would not produce subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. Are we saying that this is in line with historical facts? Only the proletarian dictatorship can eliminate the three isms. No ruler dares to openly call on the people to expose the three isms. The Communist Party does this, which proves that the proletarian dictatorship has unparalleled superiority.
　　Chen Xingui said in his speech at today's meeting that he never makes remarks against his will. Qian Jiaju revealed that this statement is not true. Qian Jiaju said: Chen Xingui said in his speech at the Socialist Academy that everyone is now "preserving their lives in troubled times," and "if the state has no morality, then one should hide." In the past, one could hide in the countryside, but now it is not possible. The liberation of the people of the whole country is seen by Chen Xingui as "troubled times" and "immoral." These two sentences can be regarded as the essence of his thoughts. According to his statement, to change "troubled times" into "times of peace" and to change "immorality" into "morality," one can only abolish the proletarian dictatorship. But today he said that he does not oppose the proletarian dictatorship and he does not oppose the Communist Party. Isn't this against his will? Then Qian Jiaju asked Chen Xingui: Since now is a troubled time and immoral, what should we do? Should we restore the dictatorship of landlords, capitalists, and the U.S. imperialism Chiang Kai-shek? Qian Jiaju said that Chen Xingui's speech today did not recognize his mistakes at all, and this has been consistent with him.
　　Finally, Qian Jiaju criticized a few right-wingers for muddying the waters in the rectification movement, using the rectification as an excuse to oppose socialism and the Communist Party. He said, why should we criticize Chu Anping's erroneous thoughts? Because he is representative. He represents some people who want to "gain something" in the rectification movement, and there are many people in the China Democratic League who support him. Qian Jiaju said that the basis for long-term coexistence is socialism. If we are half-hearted about this path, we will not be able to coexist, let alone coexist for a long time. He hopes that people in the China Democratic League who have common ideas with Chu Anping will give an explanation to all League members. Qian Jiaju also welcomed Ye Duyi's review.
　　Tao Dayong said: The podium of the China Democratic League Central Committee group has been occupied by some strange theorists
　　Tao Dayong said in his speech: Judging from the remarks recently published in the newspapers, the podium of our China Democratic League Central Committee group in the past has been occupied by some strange theorists. Yesterday, the Normal University branch committee held a meeting, and someone said: Why does the League Central Committee group always make such remarks? Today, the People's Daily also published the news that the Fudan University China Democratic League branch wants the League Central Committee to express its attitude. I think it is very important and this is a test for the League Central Committee.
　　Tao Dayong said: Chen Xingui's speech just now did not recognize the seriousness of his mistakes. In his view, sectarianism and the proletarian dictatorship are related. To eliminate sectarianism, we can only eliminate the proletarian dictatorship. We all know that the most fundamental problem in Marxism is not class struggle. The most important and central part of Marxism is the proletarian dictatorship. The core, basic problem and starting point of Leninism is also the proletarian dictatorship. Without the proletarian dictatorship, we have nothing. Chairman Mao also said: Marxism-Leninism is the theoretical basis guiding our thinking. And the proletarian dictatorship is the political basis of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, without the proletarian dictatorship, we cannot talk about socialism at all. Chen Xingui has been studying for several years and is still studying at the Socialist Academy. It is really unforgivable to make such absurd remarks. Although he is not subjectively malicious, it is easy to make people feel that he is maliciously motivated. I am very excited because it is something I never dreamed of that such ridiculous remarks would appear on the podium of the China Democratic League Central Committee. This is not a problem of ideological understanding, but a fundamental problem involving our national system. We must seriously face this problem.
　　Tao Dayong also said: The struggle on the ideological front is still going on, and this struggle is the biggest test for our intellectuals. Why are the ideas of the working class different from the ideas of intellectuals? Why do some people verbally support Marxism-Leninism, but actually oppose Marxism-Leninism? In the final analysis, it is still a question of whether to stand on the side of the people.
　　Finally, Tao Dayong talked about the issue of the League Central Committee having to express its attitude again. He suggested that the League Central Committee should rearrange the work of the China Democratic League in the future. He said: It seems that the League Central Committee still needs to strengthen Marxist education and strengthen political and ideological education for League members. This morning, some League members came to me and said: If the League Central Committee is like this, what face do we have to meet people? Therefore, like many League members, I eagerly hope that the League Central Committee will quickly express its attitude and draw a clear line between right and wrong on some issues of principle.
　　Luo Ziwei believes that some of Zhang Bojun's remarks cater to the tastes of some people who oppose the Party's leadership
　　Luo Ziwei said in his speech that he welcomed Ye Duyi's review, but his thoughts are quite representative in the China Democratic League. For example, some League members in schools demanded the abolition of the Party's leadership. Luo Ziwei asked the China Democratic League Central Committee to be vigilant about this and to pay attention to this issue.
　　He said that he suspected two points about Zhang Bojun's remarks: (1) One should not bring finished products to the State Council meeting; (2) Zhang Bojun, as one of the national leaders, seems unable to participate in national affairs.
　　Luo Ziwei said that recently some people said that the Party group in the organs did not consult with everyone when raising questions, and therefore attempted to negate the leadership of the Party group. He said that of course the Party group can solicit opinions beforehand and then bring the questions out for discussion, but how can it be said that it is undemocratic to bring them out for discussion and research without prior consultation? Doesn't the Party group even have this right? He said that we should analyze all kinds of anti-Party thoughts.
　　Some people also want to negate the leadership of the Party group on the pretext that the work style of individual Party group leaders is not good.
　　From these many aspects, today a part of the people are attempting to negate the leadership of the Party through various obscure statements. He said that we should improve our sense of smell. What does Zhang Bojun mean by disagreeing to bring out finished products for discussion? This shows that Zhang Bojun's remarks in these aspects cater to the tastes of some people who oppose the Party's leadership.
　　Luo Ziwei also said that Zhang Bojun participated in the discussion of many major national affairs. Even before the CPC convened the "Eighth National Congress," they invited non-Party people to solicit opinions. Where else is there such a democratic political party? What does Zhang Bojun mean by saying that he seems unable to hear about and know about national affairs?
　　Hu Yuzhi talked about the harmfulness of Chu Anping and Luo Longji's speeches from a letter
　　Hu Yuzhi read a letter. The letter was addressed to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, but it was marked as written to "Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping" and "Vice Chairman Luo Longji." The letter expressed great gratitude to Luo Longji and Chu Anping, calling them "kind people" and asking them to "appeal for his grievances." And they carried out vicious slanders against the Communist Party. For example, they said that the Communist Party "kills people and sets fires," and that it is "robbery," and said that "the Communist Party is nearing the grave," etc. Hu Yuzhi believes that some people are now using the rectification to spread dissatisfaction with the Party. The harmfulness of the speeches of Chu Anping and Luo Longji can be seen from this. Therefore, Hu Yuzhi agreed with Vice Chairman Shi Liang's opinion, asking the comrades who made erroneous remarks to clarify right and wrong, and also agreed with the Fudan University China Democratic League branch's request that the China Democratic League Central Committee state its position and attitude on great blooming and great contending.
　　Chen Xingui admitted that his recent speech was wrong, but continued to defend his mistakes
　　Chen Xingui admitted in his speech that his recent speech was wrong, but did not explain what was wrong; on the other hand, he continued to defend his mistakes. For example, he emphasized that he did not deny the historical role of the proletarian dictatorship; he also admitted that Chairman Mao combined the actual situation in China to develop Marxism-Leninism, which can overcome some of the weaknesses of the proletarian dictatorship, etc.
　　At the third meeting of the China Democratic League Central Committee group, Chen Xingui, in addition to expressing his complete agreement with Chu Anping's statement that the Communist Party's idea of the Party's world is the ultimate root of all sectarianism, also believed that Chu Anping was probably afraid of being labeled as a revisionist and did not dare to point out that the ideological root of the Party's world is the proletarian dictatorship. However, in his speech yesterday, Chen Xingui completely disregarded the sharp contradiction with his previous speech, and made an untenable defense for himself: he said that now I realize that my and Chu Anping's starting points are different. Because "the Party's world" and "the proletarian dictatorship" are two different concepts, I am pointing out its weaknesses that produce sectarianism, etc., under the premise of affirming the proletarian dictatorship.

　　民盟中央昨晚的座谈会开得特别热烈
　　要求民盟由右向左转
　　史良揭露章伯钧的两面态度
　　邓初民建议召开中央常委扩大会
    本报讯　中国民主同盟中央小组座谈会昨天晚上举行了第四次会议。显然，某些民盟盟员，特别是某些民盟负责人最近发表的一些错误言论，以及民盟中央对这些错误言论没有表示明确的态度，已经引起了广大盟员和盟的中央委员的异常的关切和极大的不满。因此，昨晚参加会议的中央委员、候补中央委员和盟中央的工作人员显得特别踊跃，人数差不多超过前一次会议的一倍。会议从八点钟破例地开到十一点钟，一直在非常热烈非常紧张的气氛中进行，到会议宣布结束，还有一些报名发言的人没有得到发言的机会。会上发言的中央委员罗涵先、中央常务委员叶笃义、副主席史良、中央委员千家驹、候补中央委员陶大镛、中央委员罗子为、中央委员张毕来、中央常务委员胡愈之、邓初民、候补中央委员张纪域，都集中地对民盟副主席章伯钧、罗隆基、候补中央委员陈新桂、民盟盟员储安平等的错误言论作了批判，并且一致要求民盟中央应该对这些错误言论明确地表示态度，要求民盟中央和民盟成员必须和这种反社会主义的言论在思想上划清界限。否则就不可能在社会主义这一基础上与共产党长期共存。因此，邓初民发言中建议，立即召开中央常务委员会扩大会议来解决这一问题。最后，主持会议的中央常务委员郭则沉表示将建议民盟中央常务委员会立即加以考虑。
    会上还有中央常务委员叶笃义、候补中央委员陈新桂对自己发表的一些错误议论作了自我批评。发言的人对叶笃义所作的自我批评表示欢迎，但对陈新桂所作的自我批评仍极不满意，认为他根本没有从思想上认识自己错误的严重性，并对他今天的发言又作了批判。会上发言的还有中央委员鲜英。
    罗涵先说：右派言论是向党、向国家、向社会主义进攻
    罗涵先说，少数右翼分子的言论，无论就其性质、目的和提出问题的方法来看，是一个向社会主义挑战、向无产阶级专政的国家和政权挑战，向共产党挑战、向以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线挑战的政治问题。有人认为储安平敢于作这样反动的言论，要是背后没有大力者加以支持是不可设想的。因此他主张民盟中央必须明确表示，和储安平划清界限。
    接着他批评了储安平和陈新桂。他认为在这些荒谬的错误的和反动的言论中，这两个人是最突出的代表。
    他说，认为共产党领导就是“党天下”和否认无产阶级专政的少数右派分子在实质上是反社会主义的。他说，陈新桂在他的发言中列举了很多作为宗派主义事例的事实，例如，通过党员实现党的政策、通过积极分子发挥助手作用、任用干部讲究政治条件、选拔留学生注意政治品质、工人阶级培养本阶级的知识分子等等，其实这些都是完全正确的事情，是贯彻和体现无产阶级专政所必要的措施。这些措施和我们所反对的宗派主义毫无共同之处。
    罗涵先发言中最后批评了章伯钧等人。他说，章伯钧意见中的主要错误在于他所主张的政治设计院和党的领导原则是有抵触的；这个设计院是介于党和全国人民代表大会之上的，因此是错误的。罗隆基意见中的主要错误在于他所主张的平反委员会，要与原来的党所领导的三反、五反、肃反领导机构分开，表现了对于党的领导的怀疑；叶笃义同志的主要错误在于他的意见实质上取消了党在学校中甚至一切国家机关中的领导。这些意见性质上都是严重的。
    叶笃义进行检讨，说他对自己的错误言论发生有害影响感到惭愧
    叶笃义在会上对他自己的错误言论进行了自我批评。他说：我在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上所发表的错误言论，在社会上发生了有害的影响，对民盟本身的威信也造成了一定的损失，我感到十分惭愧和痛心。
    接着，他对自己的错误言论进行了初步的分析和批判。他说：
    首先，我认为在学校、机关、企业中不宜强调党派关系，不宜强调发挥包括中共在内的党组织作用，这个看法是极端错误的。我一方面承认需要党在全国和省市范围的方针政策上的领导，但另一方面又认为可以减少各个业务单位的党的组织作用。这实际上就把党的领导架在空中，着不了地。事实上，党的总方针政策是需要通过各个业务单位来实践的。因此，要使党的方针政策得到贯彻实施就需要加强而不是减少各个单位党的核心领导作用。
    叶笃义用他自己工作岗位上的实例来说明这一点。他说：我在我的工作岗位上负一部分行政领导责任。我常常感到那个机关的党支部在保证行政任务的完成上缺乏力量，而除了党支部以外，我没有更好的依靠来联系群众，贯彻实施行政任务。因此我在我的机关整风会上向党所提的意见就是党组织太弱了，应该加强。这说明我自己业务上的实践就给我主观主义的想法一个有力的驳斥。
    接着，他又批判了他提出的：“在国家机关中，有了党派组织活动，多一层身份就多一层关系，也就多一层产生矛盾的机会”的错误说法。他说，这个看法也是极端错误的。从马克思主义的观点看来，事物内部存在着矛盾是一种普遍的永恒的现象。在当前这个伟大的整风运动中所出现的错误言论——我的言论也是其中之一，少数右派分子的反党、反社会主义的反动论调，和极少数暗藏的反革命分子所进行的乱发匿名恐吓信件的卑鄙的反动行为，这一切都说明矛盾是存在着的，而且表现得相当激烈。阶级斗争，尤其是思想上的阶级斗争就成为必不可少的了。当然，除了极少数反革命分子的破坏活动而外，应当说大多数都还是人民内部的矛盾。党派的存在是反映现实的，是为的更好地解决这些矛盾的，而绝不会产生矛盾。
    叶笃义还批判了他提出的：民主党派可以不必建立基层组织，不必过组织生活的错误论调，他说，这个想法既不符合党派成员的要求，也违背社会主义类型民主党派的精神实质。社会主义的民主党派对它们的成员有进行教育、进行思想改造的重大责任，使它们的成员们都能顺利地过渡到名副其实的劳动人民和劳动知识分子。假如不建立基层组织，不过组织生活，政治思想教育的工作通过什么来进行呢？
    叶笃义认为：从旧社会出身的知识分子，旧的反动的那一套资产阶级思想随时都会冒出头来。我的错误的思想和言论充分说明这一点。知识分子的思想改造是一个长期的艰巨的过程。因此加强政治思想教育就成为民主党派的首要的而且是长期的任务。我一方面要加紧自己的自我思想改造，另方面也热烈地要求盟组织给我帮助。
    叶笃义最后对章伯钧所提出的政治设计院的主张、罗隆基提出的成立平反委员会的主张、以及储安平、陈新桂等的谬论进行了批判。
    邓初民认为必须根本解决民盟中存在的问题，才能与共产党长期共存
    邓初民在发言中说：人民日报以“可注意的民盟动向”为题的报道，和民盟上海复旦大学支部要求民盟中央对民盟成员最近不少的错误言论表示态度，都值得我们注意。邓初民说，民盟成员的错误言论在各民主党派中占了多数，但这要发表错误言论的人自己负责，他们的错误言论不能代表民盟。否则，他认为其他民主党派可以与共产党“长期共存”，民盟就不能与共产党“长期共存”了。因此，邓初民建议，立即召开中央常务委员会扩大会议，讨论这些错误言论究竟是代表个人，还是代表民盟的问题。
    邓初民接着说：这次整风运动开始还不久，可是，知识分子的缺点暴露的却很多。社会主义要对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业进行改造，我看这些改造的问题都不大，就是知识分子改造还成问题。而民盟是对知识分子作工作的。因此，我建议召开中央常务委员会扩大会议，从根本上解决民盟中存在的问题。
    邓初民最后说：在帮助共产党整风中一定会有敌人钻空子，这是绝大多数人民与极少数反革命分子斗争的问题，我们民盟必须加以注意。
    千家驹说：储安平代表了某些想在整风中“捞一把”的人，民盟中支持他的大有人在
    千家驹说，陈新桂在社会主义学院学习了以后，非但没有很好地改造思想，反而找来些教条作为反对社会主义的根据。陈新桂的错误在于把无产阶级专政同共产党专政混为一谈了。无产阶级专政是通过无产阶级先锋队即共产党的领导而实现的，但决不等于说无产阶级专政就是共产党专政。如果是共产党专政，那就是共产党员对非共产党员的专政，是工人阶级中的共产党员对工人阶级中的非共产党员专政。马列主义从来没有把这二者等同起来，这是资产阶级诬蔑共产党的话。而陈新桂却居然拿起资产阶级的武器来反对我们。
    千家驹接着解释了人民民主专政为什么在实质上就是无产阶级专政，说明无产阶级专政的经验还不多，有些错误是难免的，但决不能因此就否定无产阶级专政。按照陈新桂的逻辑推论，反对三个主义，就必须取消无产阶级专政，同时，过去的专政即资产阶级专政、封建地主专政都是不会产生主观主义官僚主义和宗派主义的。我们说这是符合历史事实的吗？只有无产阶级专政才能消灭三个主义，没有哪个执政者敢于公开号召人民来揭露三个主义，共产党这样做，这证明无产阶级专政有无比的优越性。
    陈新桂在今天会上的发言中说，他向来不作违心之论，千家驹揭露他这种说法是不真实的。千家驹说：陈新桂在社会主义学院发言中曾说现在大家是“苟全性命于乱世”，“邦无道则隐”，过去还可以隐到田园去，现在不行了。全国人民的解放在陈新桂看来是“乱世”，是“无道”这两句话可作为他的思想本质。按照他的说法，变“乱世”为“治世”，变“无道”为“有道”，就只有取消无产阶级专政了。而今天他却说他不反对无产阶级专政，他不反对共产党，这不是违心之论是什么？接着千家驹反问陈新桂：既然现在是乱世、无道，到底要怎么办呢？是否恢复地主、资本家、美帝国主义蒋介石的专政呢？千家驹说，陈新桂今天的发言完全没有认识自己的错误，而这在他是一贯的。
    最后，千家驹又批判了少数右派在整风中混水摸鱼，假借整风反社会主义、反共。他说，为什么要批判储安平的错误思想呢？因为他有代表性，他代表了某些想在整风中“捞一把”的人，而且民盟中支持他的大有人在。千家驹说，长期共存的基础是社会主义，如果对这条道路三心二意，就共存不下去，更说不上长期共存了。他希望民盟中和储安平的思想有共鸣的人要向全盟同志有所交代。千家驹还对叶笃义的检讨表示欢迎。
    陶大镛说：民盟中央小组的讲台给一些奇怪的理论家占领了
    陶大镛在发言中首先说：从报纸上最近发表的言论看，过去我们民盟中央小组的讲台，给一些奇怪的理论家占领了。昨天师大支部委员会开会，有人说：为什么盟中央小组尽发这样的言论？今天人民日报也发表了复旦大学民盟支部要盟中央表示态度的消息，我认为很值得重视，这对盟中央是个考验。
    陶大镛说：陈新桂刚才的发言，并没有认识到他的错误的严重性，在他看来，宗派主义和无产阶级专政是相关联的，要消灭宗派主义，只有消灭无产阶级专政。我们都知道：马克思主义中最根本的问题还不是阶级斗争，马克思主义的最重要、最中心的部分是无产阶级专政，列宁主义的核心、基本问题和出发点也是无产阶级专政。没有无产阶级专政，我们什么都没有了。毛主席也曾说：马克思列宁主义是指导我们思想的理论基础。而无产阶级专政又是马克思列宁主义的政治基础，因此，没有了无产阶级专政，我们根本就谈不到社会主义。陈新桂已经经过几年学习，今天仍在社会主义学院学习，竟然讲出如此荒谬的言论，实在不可原谅。尽管他主观上不是别有用心，但是很容易使人感到他是别有用心。我说得很激动，因为，在民盟中央的讲台上竟然出现这样荒唐透顶的言论，这是我做梦也没有想到的。这不是一个思想认识问题，而是牵涉到我们国家制度的根本问题，我们必须严肃地正视这个问题。
    陶大镛还说：现在思想战线上的斗争还在进行，这个斗争对我们知识分子是最大的考验。为什么工人阶级的想法和知识分子的想法就不同呢？为什么有些人口头上拥护马克思列宁主义，实际上又在反对马克思列宁主义呢？这归根到底，还是站不站在人民的立场的问题。
    最后，陶大镛又一次谈到盟中央必须表示态度的问题，他建议盟中央要对民盟今后工作重新安排。他说：今天看起来，盟中央仍须对盟员加强马克思主义教育，加强政治思想教育。今天早上，有些盟员来找我，他们说：盟中央如此，我们还有什么脸见人呢？所以，我和许多盟员一样，都热切盼望盟中央对一些原则性的问题赶快表示态度，划清是非。
    罗子为认为章伯钧的某些言论符合反对党的领导的一些人的口味
    罗子为发言中说，他欢迎叶笃义的检讨，但是他的思想在民盟中是有相当代表性的，例如学校中有些盟员就要求取消党的领导。罗子为要求民盟中央警惕这一点，要求重视这个问题。
    他说，他对章伯钧的言论怀疑两点：（1）国务院的会议上不该拿出成品；（2）章伯钧身为国家领导人之一，好像国家大事还不能参与。
    罗子为说，最近有人说机关党组提出问题的时候没同大家商量，因此企图否定党组的领导。他说，当然党组事先可以征求意见再把问题拿出来讨论，但事先没商量而拿出来同大家讨论研究，这怎么就能说不民主呢？难道党组连这个权利都没有了吗？他说，我们应该对各种各样的反党思想加以分析。
    还有人借口个别党组领导人作风不好就想否定党组的领导。
    从这许多方面来看，今天有一部分人通过各种隐晦的提法，企图否定党的领导，他说，我们要提高嗅觉。章伯钧不同意拿出成品来讨论，这是什么意思？这说明章伯钧在这些方面的言论是符合一些反对党的领导的人的味口的。
    罗子为又说，许多国家大事的讨论章伯钧是参加了，甚至中共召开“八大”以前，都邀请党外人士征求意见，那里还有这样民主的政党？章伯钧的意思好像国家大事未能闻问不知是什么意思？
    胡愈之从一封来信谈储安平罗隆基发言的危害性
    胡愈之宣读了一封来信，信面是寄给中国民主同盟中央委员会的，信里却注明是写给“储安平总编辑”、“罗隆基副主席”的，信上对罗隆基储安平表示十分感谢，称他们为“善良的人”，要求为他“伸诉冤枉”。而对共产党却进行了恶毒的污蔑。如说共产党“杀人放火”“强盗行为”，说“共产党快到坟墓”等等。胡愈之认为：现在有些人利用整风，散布对党的不满，储安平、罗隆基二位的发言，其危害性从此可见。因此胡愈之同意史良副主席的意见，请发表错误言论的同志弄清是非，也同意复旦大学民盟支部要求民盟中央表明在大鸣大放的立场和态度。
    陈新桂一面承认他最近发言是错了，但又继续为自己的错误辩解
    陈新桂发言中一方面承认他最近的发言是错了，但并没有说明错在什么地方；另一方面还在继续为自己的错误作辩解。比如他强调说，他并没有否认无产阶级专政在历史上的作用；他也承认毛主席结合中国实际情况发展了马克思列宁主义，就可以克服无产阶级专政的一些弱点等等。
    陈新桂在民盟中央小组座谈会第三次会议上除表示完全同意储安平所说的共产党的党天下思想是一切宗派主义的最后根源而外，还认为储安平大概是怕戴上修正主义的帽子，不敢指出党天下的思想根源就是无产阶级专政。而陈新桂在昨天发言中却完全不顾与上次发言的尖锐矛盾，在为自己作不能自圆其说的辩解：他说现在我认识到我跟储安平的说法的出发点是不同的。因为“党天下”与“无产阶级专政”是两个不同的概念，我是在肯定无产阶级专政的前提之下，指出它有产生宗派主义之类的弱点。
