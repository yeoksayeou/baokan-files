Xinhua News Agency, 18th -- The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today issued a statement regarding the incident of Guangming Daily's political direction being once tampered with. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　Guangming Daily is the common newspaper of our various democratic parties. In the past two months, Zhang Bojun, the president, and Chu Anping, the editor-in-chief, have turned Guangming Daily from a socialist political direction into a bourgeois political direction. Chu Anping even used the name of "Editor-in-Chief of Guangming Daily, the central organ of the various democratic parties" to publish anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks. We cannot tolerate and are extremely indignant at Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's act of using their positions to deliberately usurp Guangming Daily. We severely condemn them and declare as follows:

　　(1) For more than two months, Zhang Bojun has changed the line and policies of Guangming Daily without consulting with the various democratic parties or convening a board meeting. This line and policy completely violates our RCCK's political line of serving socialism. The serious political errors that have occurred should be the responsibility of President Zhang Bojun.

　　(2) With the support of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping emphasized in the editorial policy that only deviations and shortcomings of the Communist Party and the government should be reported, refused to publish editorials promoting the policies and guidelines of the Party and the government, published many anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks without criticism, tried to publish news unfavorable to the socialist cause as much as possible, attempted to incite anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments; and, without the consent of the various democratic parties, used the name of Guangming Daily to hold symposiums in nine major cities, attempting to concentrate on propagating anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies in various places. These actions and their consequences should be fully borne by President Zhang Bojun and Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping.

　　(3) The working comrades of Guangming Daily promptly and repeatedly objected to Chu Anping's use of Guangming Daily to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist propaganda, but Chu Anping suppressed them. Zhang Bojun did not support the correct opinions of the working comrades of Guangming Daily but supported Chu Anping. Here, we express our full support for the working comrades of Guangming Daily who adhere to the correct stand, and hope that they will conduct investigations within the scope of their duties, expose Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's usurpation, and eliminate the toxins they spread internally.

　　(4) Our RCCK Central Committee will further analyze and discuss the issue of Guangming Daily and put forward opinions. Regarding Zhang Bojun's unauthorized change of Guangming Daily's line and policies during this period, and Chu Anping's publication of reactionary remarks under the guise of Guangming Daily's editor-in-chief, we have decided to investigate their responsibilities.

　　民革中央委员会发表声明
    谴责章伯钧储安平篡改光明日报政治方向
    新华社18日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会今天对光明日报被一度篡改政治方向事件发表声明。声明全文如下：
    光明日报是我们各民主党派共同的报纸。近两个月来，社长章伯钧、总编辑储安平把光明日报从社会主义的政治方向变为资产阶级的政治方向，储安平更假借“各民主党派中央机关报光明日报总编辑”的名义，发表反共产党、反社会主义的言论。我们对于章伯钧、储安平这种利用职权，有意篡夺光明日报的行为，不能容忍，极为愤慨，严加谴责，并声明如下：
    （1）章伯钧两个多月来不与各民主党派商量，也不召开社务委员会，即擅改光明日报的路线方针。这个路线方针，完全违反我们民革为社会主义服务的政治路线。其所发生的严重的政治错误，应由社长章伯钧负责。
    （2）储安平在章伯钧支持下，在编辑方针上强调只报导共产党和政府的偏差和缺点，拒绝发表宣传党和政府政策方针的社论；不加批驳地刊登许多反党反社会主义的言论，尽量刊登不利于社会主义事业的新闻，企图煽动反党反社会主义的情绪；并且不经各民主党派同意，用光明日报名义到九大城市召开座谈会，企图在各地集中宣传反党反社会主义的谬论。这些行动及其后果，应该完全由社长章伯钧、总编辑储安平负责。
      （3）光明日报的工作同志对于储安平利用光明日报进行反党反社会主义宣传，曾及时并屡次提出反对，但储安平加以压制，章伯钧不支持光明日报工作同志的正确意见而支持储安平。在这里，我们表示完全支持光明日报坚持正确立场的工作同志，并希望他们在自己的职责范围内进行检查，揭发章伯钧、储安平的篡夺行为，消除他们在内部所散布的毒素。
    （4）我们民革中央对于光明日报的问题，还将作进一步的分析讨论，提出意见。对于章伯钧在这一时期内擅改光明日报的路线方针，储安平假借光明日报总编辑名义发表反动言论，我们决定要追究他们应负的责任。
