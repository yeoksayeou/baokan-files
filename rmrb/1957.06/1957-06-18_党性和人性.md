　　Party Spirit and Human Nature
　　Ding San
    The Party spirit referred to here is the Party spirit of communists.

    In the eyes of some people (such as Huang Jizhong, a lecturer at Peking University), Party spirit and human nature seem to be mutually exclusive; having Party spirit means lacking human nature. What is the evidence for this? It is said that some people used to talk about everything with their friends, but after joining the Party, they became estranged and had nothing to talk about when they met; while some Party members were originally incompatible with the masses and had poor relations, but once they were expelled from the Party, they became approachable and made friends with everyone. This is the evidence that Party spirit "strangles" human nature.

    Before analyzing and criticizing this evidence, I would like to talk about some common sense, so as not to be accused of not having "human nature." Just as there is no abstract person or Party, there is also no abstract human nature or Party spirit. Both human nature and Party spirit are products of history and are concrete things. In terms of human nature, historically, the "drinking blood of raw animals" of primitive society was a kind of human nature, and "public and private as one" was also a kind of human nature. The "man eats man" of feudal society was a kind of human nature, and riots and uprisings were also a kind of human nature. The "man exploits man" of capitalist society is a kind of human nature, and strikes and revolutions are also a kind of human nature. Looking at the current situation in our country, defending socialism is a kind of human nature, and undermining socialism is also a kind of human nature; supporting the leadership of the Communist Party is a kind of human nature, and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party is also a kind of human nature. Within the Party, a large number of Party members have always shared weal and woe with the masses, some Party members have gradually become detached from the masses, some Party members have infantile disorders, some Party members have been punished, and some Party members have been expelled from the Party—all of this is related to their respective "human nature." This is precisely where the great significance of Party rectification lies. Precisely because human nature is so complex, there must be Party spirit, otherwise it will be impossible to consciously unite all forces that can be united, transform society, transform the world, transform "human nature," and create a new socialist and communist world. Party spirit is the combination of the communist revolutionary ideal and the revolutionary fighting spirit of realism, it is the concentration of noble human nature, it is the leading force for constantly improving human nature, and it is also the mortal enemy of all reactionary and bad human nature. Party spirit and human nature are contradictory and unified.

    Therefore, from the perspective of Party spirit, some human nature must be promoted, supported, and developed; some human nature must be "suppressed" and transformed; and some human nature must be "strangled." Since we want to take the socialist road, shouldn't the selfish and self-interested "human nature" of man exploiting man be "suppressed"? Shouldn't the "human nature" of counter-revolutionaries be "strangled"? Suppressing and strangling this kind of human nature is precisely for the purpose of promoting and developing the beautiful human nature of socialism, the human nature that modern Chinese people should vigorously cultivate!

    Therefore, the phenomenon of Party spirit "strangling" human nature is not necessarily a bad phenomenon. The key lies in what kind of "human nature" is being "strangled." Is it good to "talk about everything with friends"? First, it depends on who the "friends" are; second, it depends on what is being "talked about." If joining the Party reduces a little bit of the liberalism of talking nonsense, I don't see anything wrong with that, even if it gives people a feeling of "estrangement" and "incompatibility," or even being given the epithet of "suppressing human nature." As for being "more approachable" after being expelled from the Party and "making friends with everyone," that just proves that Party spirit has not "strangled" human nature; rather, some kind of human nature has "strangled" Party spirit, so they joined the Party and were then expelled from the Party.

    In short: In order to improve human nature, Party spirit will inevitably "suppress" and even "strangle" certain human nature. Is this evidence of undemocratic or unfree? That can only prove that your democracy and freedom are not our democracy and freedom. We are going to build socialism. As for the saying that "having Party spirit means lacking human nature," that is a thorough slander of Party spirit, and this slander is precisely a concrete manifestation of some kind of "human nature."

　　党性和人性
　　丁三
    这里说的党性是共产党人的党性。
    在有些人（例如北京大学讲师黄继忠）看来，党性和人性似不两立，有党性即无人性。何以见得？据说有些人原来跟朋友们无所不谈，但入了党，便疏远了，见了面也无话可谈；而有些党员原先跟群众格格不入，关系恶劣，但一旦被开除了党籍，反而变得可亲，跟大家交起朋友来了。这便是党性“扼杀”人性的证据。
    在分析批判这个证据以前，我想先讲点常识，免得说我没有“人性”。正如没有抽象的人和党一样，也没有抽象的人性和党性。人性和党性都是历史的产物，是具体的东西。就人性说，从历史上看，原始社会的“茹毛饮血”是一种人性，“公私一体”也是一种人性。封建社会的“人吃人”是一种人性，暴动、起义也是一种人性。资本主义社会的“人剥削人”是一种人性，罢工、革命也是一种人性。从我国现状看，保卫社会主义是一种人性，破坏社会主义也是一种人性；拥护共产党的领导是一种人性，反对共产党的领导也是一种人性。从党内看，大批党员始终与群众共甘苦，有些党员渐渐脱离群众，有些党员有幼稚病，有些党员受了处分，有些党员被开除了党籍——凡此一切也都与各自的“人性”有关。这正是整党整风的伟大意义所在。正因为人性如此复杂，所以必须有党性，否则就不能有意识地团结一切可能团结的力量，改造社会，改造世界，改造“人性”，创造社会主义、共产主义新世界。党性是共产主义的革命理想和现实主义的革命战斗精神的结合，是高尚人性的集中，是不断提高人性的领导力量，同时也是一切反动的、恶劣的人性的死对头。党性和人性矛盾而又统一。
    所以从党性的观点看，有些人性必须加以发扬、扶植、发展；有些人性必须加以“压抑”、改造；有些人性必须加以“扼杀”。既然要走社会主义的路，难道人剥削人的自私自利的“人性”不应该加以“压抑”吗？难道反革命的“人性”不应该加以“扼杀”吗？压抑和扼杀这一类的人性，正是为了发扬和发展社会主义的优美的人性，现代中国人应该大力培养的人性！
    所以党性“扼杀”人性的现象，不一定都是坏现象，关键在于被“扼杀”的是哪一种“人性”。“跟朋友们无所不谈”好不好呢？第一，要看“朋友们”是什么人；第二，要看“无所不谈”的是什么事。如果入党以后减少了一点信口开河的自由主义，我看也没有什么不好，即使给人以“疏远”、“格格不入”的感觉，甚至被给予“压抑人性”的恶谥。至于被开除党籍以后“反而变得可亲”，“和大家交起朋友来了”，那也恰恰证明了党性并没有“扼杀”了人性，倒是某种人性“扼杀”了党性，所以入了党，又被开除出党了。
    总而言之：为了提高人性，党性是难免要“压抑”甚至“扼杀”某种人性的。这就是不民主、不自由的证据吗？那也只能证明你的民主和自由不是我们的民主和自由。我们要建设社会主义啰。至于什么“有党性即无人性”的说法，那是对党性的彻头彻尾的污蔑，而这种污蔑也正是某种“人性”的具体表现。
