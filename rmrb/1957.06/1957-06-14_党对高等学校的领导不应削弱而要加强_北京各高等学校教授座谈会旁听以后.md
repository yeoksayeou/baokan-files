　　The Party's Leadership Over Institutions of Higher Education Should Not Be Weakened but Strengthened
　　——After Attending a Symposium of Professors from Various Universities in Beijing——
　　By Our Correspondent Sun Zunian
    How to run institutions of higher education well during the rectification movement? The issue of leadership in institutions of higher education has become the central topic of discussion among professors. I attended several symposiums of professors in Beijing and also contacted some professors individually. Based on my understanding, there are different views among professors on this issue. Some advocate "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management." Others oppose this view, arguing that although those who propose "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management" also say verbally that they want to strengthen the Party's leadership, if implemented according to the methods of "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management," it would essentially abolish the Party's leadership, which is not feasible. The current issue is not to negate the leadership of the Party committee, but how to improve the leadership methods and work style of the Party committee, expand democracy, further strengthen the Party's leadership, and better run institutions of higher education.

    "Professors Managing Schools" and "Democratic School Management"

    The rationale for advocating "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management" is that non-Party cadres who are "experts" are much better at running institutions of higher education than Party cadres who are "laymen." "Laymen" leading "experts" cannot run institutions of higher education well. Therefore, institutions of higher education must be led by professors. Those who hold these views have different opinions on how to manage schools in the future, which can be divided into two categories: The first category advocates "professors managing schools," with the method of forming a "professors' association" composed of associate professors and above, and the professors' association then elects an evaluation committee. Its task is to be responsible for solving major issues in the school, such as hiring professors, dismissing professors, adding departments, and allocating funds. Major matters that the evaluation committee cannot decide, or matters that the president considers very important, are resolved by convening a professors' association meeting. In the school, the president's responsibilities and powers are not great, but things are easy to handle because the professors' association supports him. Sometimes when students have problems that the president cannot solve, the students can accept the decision of the professors' association. This shows that the "professors' association" is the highest authority in institutions of higher education. The second category advocates "democratic school management," with the method of separating two types of work: administrative work is handled by the administrative conference; matters related to teaching and scientific research are handled by the academic committee. For example, matters related to academic and teaching, such as the appointment of professors, the promotion of associate professors to professors, the promotion of lecturers to associate professors, retaining teaching assistants, and recruiting graduate students, are the responsibility of the academic committee. Regarding financial work, mainly budget and final accounts, the members of the administrative conference should report to the academic committee. The academic committee is composed of representatives of professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. The Party committee can send representatives to participate and can also put forward the Party committee's suggestions at the meeting, but the academic committee does not necessarily have to follow the Party committee's opinions. The academic committee is the highest authority in institutions of higher education. So-called "democratic school management" is actually "professors managing schools."

    Since these methods of "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management" were proposed, professors have engaged in heated discussions at various symposiums. A considerable number of professors disagree with the proposals of "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management." At the symposium of professors and experts held by the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, Lou Bangyan, deputy leader of the Education Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former professor of Tsinghua University, said: "I have three different experiences with the issue of 'professors managing schools' before liberation. When I was a student at Tsinghua University, I saw that the professors' council of Tsinghua was managed by veteran professors and authoritative professors. In modern terms, it was an 'oligarchy.' Young professors had no status in the school. At that time, the factionalism of Tsinghua was absolutely certain. At that time, the professors' association hired professors, and its good effect was to block some people with poor scholarship from entering the school; but it also definitely excluded some scholars of non-Tsinghua faction from teaching. Later, when I went to Tsinghua to teach, because I was a graduate of Tsinghua, I was also cultivated into a Tsinghua person with strong factionalism. At that time, I even looked down on the professors of Peking University. Therefore, if it is said that the professors' association of Tsinghua stabilized the professors, it can only be said that it stabilized such a group of people. Later, I returned to China after studying abroad. Peking University wanted to hire me as a professor with a monthly salary of 320 yuan, and Tsinghua wanted to hire me as an associate professor with a monthly salary of 280 yuan. I still chose Tsinghua. Why? It was the influence of factionalism. When I joined Tsinghua as a teacher, I also participated in the professors' association. But I did not participate in the meeting, but listened to the meeting. Because young professors could not speak, they did not dare to speak, and the situation was under such great pressure. That was the professors' association of Tsinghua. I also understand another situation of the professors' association. In 1946, I went to Peking University to teach. Peking University also had a professors' association at that time, which was an institution for professors to fight for democracy, and the main target of struggle was Hu Shi. These two kinds of 'professors managing schools' cannot be used now. The people do not allow so-called authoritative professors to manage schools, let alone this serious factionalism. The professors' association of Peking University cannot be used now, because we are not fighting against the Communist Party. If it is to give play to the enthusiasm of professors, even if the slogan of professors managing schools is put forward, it must be specifically analyzed, otherwise the side effects will be greater than the positive effects. I think the Party committees of institutions of higher education and scientific institutions cannot be cancelled. To give play to the enthusiasm of professors, various methods must be adopted, which cannot be solved simply by putting forward the four characters of 'professors managing schools'." At the symposium held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zheng Linzhuang, professor of Renmin University of China, said: "If we abolish the leadership of the Party committee in institutions of higher education and adopt 'professors managing schools' and 'democratic school management,' will there be no problems? I don't think so. I think at most it can solve the problem of being familiar with the business, and the 'three evils' may not be completely solved. In the past few years, based on my personal experience of teaching in universities and the information I have, I have analyzed and compared the results, and I believe that the implementation of the Party committee's leadership in institutions of higher education is superior to professors managing schools." Liu Zhongrong, president of Beijing Foreign Studies University, described the current institutions of higher education as a small municipal government, which manages everything from eating, bathing, haircuts, housing to teaching, scientific research, and ideological education. He said that he, as a non-Party president, did not feel that he had power without authority. If we implement "democratic school management" and "professors managing schools," I think there will be big problems. Putting professors into administrative affairs is a loss. It will be difficult to fully guarantee the time for professors to teach and conduct scientific research. At the same time, many problems cannot be solved by the president alone. Therefore, in such a complex situation, I think today's institutions of higher education cannot be without the leadership of the Party. Professor Wang Zhen said that whether it is "professors managing schools" or "democratic school management," although the names are different, they are just the same wine in a different bottle, and their essence is to abolish or weaken the Party's leadership. How to improve the leadership of the Party committee?

    The professors who disagree with "democratic school management" and "professors managing schools" and advocate maintaining the system of president responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee in institutions of higher education do not deny that the Party committee's leadership of institutions of higher education in the past had shortcomings. They believe that if we want to strengthen the Party's leadership today, we must improve the leadership methods and work style of the Party committee. What leadership methods and work styles need to be improved? To sum up, there are mainly the following points: First, all universities or colleges have school affairs committees, but they are all equal to being nominal. For example, the Party committee of some colleges and universities often discusses and decides on major issues in the school, but is not good at bringing the Party's decisions to the school affairs committee for full research and discussion, and turning them into administrative resolutions for implementation. Instead, it is accustomed to simply arranging work through the Party organization system. Because today, most of the department heads and professors in institutions of higher education are not Party members. As a result of this arrangement from within the Party system, it objectively creates the situation where the department secretary leads the department head, and the teaching assistant leads the professor. This substitution of the Party for the government and the separation of the Party from the government objectively gives people the illusion that the Party does not politically trust senior intellectuals, creating a gap in the relationship between the Party and the masses. Second, related to the first shortcoming, the second shortcoming of the Party committee's leadership style is that it often does not pay enough attention to expanding democracy. In particular, it does not humbly listen to the opinions of experts on issues such as teaching and scientific research. Some people say that "laymen" cannot lead "experts," which makes some sense, but this opinion cannot be fully supported. No one is born an "expert," and it is a process from "layman" to "expert." If the Party committee and all Communist Party members in institutions of higher education can adopt a humble attitude of learning from others and work hard to study, they will one day reach the level of "expert," and of course, they will be able to play a real leading role. However, the opposite was true in the past. Many young Communist Party members did not respect the old professors, and some pretended to understand what they did not understand, lacked a realistic attitude, and were arrogant, considering themselves as transformers of others, which was not good. Third, the Party committee's working method of the mass line was also very poor. It is obviously not enough for the Party committee of some schools to simply rely on meetings to listen to reports and arrange work to lead. The Party committee should often concentrate on considering and studying major issues in the school, and at the same time, go down more to listen to the opinions of the masses. It is necessary to have arrangements, inspections, and timely correction of problems. This kind of work style is used to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism.

    In short, everyone's request for the Party committee to lead institutions of higher education is not to ask all members of the Party committee to immediately become experts and professors. But at least for now, the Party committee should know how to run the school. To truly give play to the due role of the Party committee, two prerequisites must be met: First, members of the Party committee must work hard to learn the business, and it is difficult to lead if they are not familiar with the business; second, we must expand democracy and listen to opinions from all sides using various methods. From now on, we should rely more on old professors to run schools. In particular, when a matter is being designed, we must pay attention to extensively listening to opinions, and reach concentration on this basis. After concentration, we cannot substitute the Party for the government, and we must give full play to the functions and powers of the school affairs committee. In the rectification movement, it is hoped that the Party committee will improve these aspects of leadership methods and work style, mobilize all positive factors, and run institutions of higher education well. Therefore, today's problem cannot be solved by "professors managing schools" and "democratic school management." Therefore, the Party's leadership over institutions of higher education should not be weakened but strengthened.

　　党对高等学校的领导不应削弱而要加强
　　——北京各高等学校教授座谈会旁听以后——
　　本报记者　孙祖年
    在整风运动中，如何办好高等学校？关于高等学校的领导问题，成为高等学校教授们讨论的中心。我参加了北京许多教授座谈会，并个别接触到一些教授。根据我了解的情况来看，目前，教授们之间对于这个问题有不同的看法。有的主张“教授治校”、“民主办校”。有的反对这个意见，他们认为：提出“教授治校”、“民主办校”的人，虽然口头上也说，要加强党的领导，但如果按照“教授治校”、“民主办校”的办法实行，实质上就是取消了党的领导，这是行不通的。目前的问题不是否定党委的领导，而是如何改进党委的领导方法和工作作风，扩大民主，进一步加强党的领导，更好的办好高等学校的问题。
    “教授治校”和“民主办校”
    主张“教授治校”、“民主办校”的理由是：办高等学校，“内行”的非党干部会比“外行”的党员干部好得多。“外行”人领导“内行”人是办不好高等学校的。因此，高等学校必须由教授们来领导。有这些看法的人，对今后怎么样管理学校，他们的具体意见可分为两类：第一类是主张“教授治校”，办法是以副教授以上的人参加来组成“教授会”，教授会再推选出一个评议会。它的任务：负责解决学校中的重大问题。例如聘请教授，辞退教授，增添系科，支配经费等。评议会不能决定的大事，或是校长认为很重大的事，就召开教授会来解决。在学校里，校长的责权不很大，但事情好办，教授会支持他。有时学生发生问题，校长不能解决，而教授会的决定学生可以接受。这就说明“教授会”是高等学校中的最高权力机构。第二类是主张“民主办校”，办法是把两种类型的工作分开：把行政工作交由行政会议处理；有关教学和科学研究方面的事项由学术委员会处理。例如教授的聘请、副教授升教授、讲师升副教授、留助教、招收研究生等与学术、教学有关的事项，由学术委员会负责。关于财务工作，主要是预算和决算，要由行政会议的成员向学术委员会报告。学术委员会由教授、副教授、讲助代表组成。党委会可派代表参加，在会上也可提出党委的建议，但学术委员会不一定要遵照党委的意见执行。学术委员会是高等学校中的最高权力机构。所谓“民主办校”，实际上还是“教授治校”。
    自从提出这些“教授治校”、“民主办校”的办法以后，在各种座谈会上，教授们进行了热烈的讨论。有相当一部分教授不同意“教授治校”和“民主办校”的主张。在九三学社中央召开的教授、专家的座谈会上，全国政协教育组副组长、原清华大学教授楼邦彦说：“我对解放前‘教授治校’的问题，有三个阶段不同的体会。在清华大学当学生时，我看清华的教授评议会是元老教授、权威教授治校。用现代术语来说，是‘寡头政治’。年青的教授，在学校里是没有地位的。当时清华的宗派主义是完全可以肯定的。当时教授会聘请教授，好的作用是挡住了一些学问不行的人入校；但也确确实实排斥了一些非清华派的有学问的人入校执教。我后来进清华教书，因为是清华的毕业生，我也被培养成有浓厚宗派主义的清华人，当时连北大的教授都看不起。因此，若说是清华的教授会安定了教授，也只能说安定了这样的一批人而已。后来我留学回国，北大要请我做教授，月薪三百二十元，清华要请我做副教授，月薪二百八十元。我还是选择了清华。为什么，是宗派主义的影响。入清华任教，我也参加了教授会。但不是参加会，而是听会。因为年轻的教授不能发言，不敢发言，形势是有如此大的压力。清华的教授会就是如此。我还理解另一种情况的教授会。1946年我到北大教书，北大当时也有教授会，是教授们用以争取民主的机构，主要斗争对象是胡适。这两种‘教授治校’都不能搬到现在来用。人民不允许所谓权威的教授治校，更不允许这种严重的宗派主义。北大的那种教授会，也不能搬到现在来用，因为我们不是和共产党作斗争的。若是为了发挥教授的积极性，即使是提教授治校的口号，也必须具体分析，不然副作用大于正作用。我认为，高等学校和科学机关的党委会不能取消，要发挥教授的积极性，要采取各种办法，不是简单的提出‘教授治校’四个字所能解决的”。在中共北京市委召开的座谈会上，中国人民大学教授郑林庄说：“如果取消高等学校中的党委领导，采取‘教授治校’、‘民主办校’是不是就没有问题了，我看不见得。我觉得最多不过解决熟悉业务的问题，‘三害’也不一定完全能解决的。几年来，我以在大学任教的亲身体会和目前所掌握的资料，进行分析、比较的结果，我认为在高等学校实行党委领导比教授治校优越”。北京外国语学院院长刘仲容形容现在的高等学校像个小市政府，从吃饭、洗澡、理发、住房到教学、科学研究、思想教育等都要管，这些情况是相当复杂的。他说，我这个非党院长没有感到有职无权的问题。如果实行“民主办校”、“教授治校”，我看就要发生大问题。把教授陷在行政事务工作里去，是得不偿失的。如何充分保证教授们的教学、进行科学研究的时间，就要发生困难。同时许多问题，校、院长一人也不能解决。因此，在这样复杂的情况下，我认为今天的高等学校不可无党的领导。王真教授说，不管“教授治校”也好，“民主办校”也好，名称虽然不同，只是换汤不换药，其实质是取消或者削弱党的领导。如何改进党委的领导？
    不同意“民主办校”和“教授治校”，主张在高等学校中仍保持党委领导下的校、院长负责制的教授们，并不否认过去党委领导高等学校有缺点。他们认为今天要加强党的领导，就必须改进党委的领导方法和工作作风。有哪些领导方法和工作作风需要改进呢？归纳起来，主要有这样几点：一，所有的大学或学院，都有校务委员会，但都等于虚设。如有的校、院党委会往往是讨论决定学校中的重大问题后，不善于把党的决定提到校务委员会议上充分的研究讨论，变为行政的决议去贯彻。而习惯于简单的通过党组织的系统去布置工作。因为今天的高等学校，绝大部分系主任、教授不是党员。这样从党内系统布置的结果，客观上就造成了系秘书领导系主任，助教领导教授了。这种以党代政，党政不分，客观上也给人以错觉，好像党在政治上不信任高级知识分子，造成党群关系的隔阂。二，与第一个缺点相联系的党委领导作风的第二个缺点，就是经常注意扩大民主不够。特别是在教学和科学研究等问题上，虚心地多听取内行人的意见不够。有人说“外行”人不能领导“内行”人，这有点道理，但这个意见也不能完全站住脚。任何人并非天生就是“内行”人，是由“外行”到“内行”的过程，如果高等学校中的党委和所有共产党员，都能抱着虚心向人学习的态度，自己刻苦钻研，总有一天能达到“内行”的，当然也就能起到真正的领导作用。可是，过去的情况完全相反，许多年轻的共产党员对老教授不尊重，有的人自己不懂装懂，缺乏实事求是的态度，而是盛气凌人，以改造别人自居，这就不好了。三，党委群众路线的工作方法也做得很差，有的学校党委单纯的靠会议听取汇报、布置工作来领导是显然不够的。党委应该经常聚精会神地考虑研究学校中的重大问题，同时要多下来，听取群众意见。做到有布置，有检查，发现问题，及时纠正，以这样的工作作风来克服官僚主义和主观主义。
    总之，大家对党委会领导高等学校，不是要求所有的党委委员都立即成为专家、教授。而目前起码的要求，党委应该懂得怎样办校。要真正发挥党委会应有的作用，必须具备两个前提：一，党委成员要努力学习业务，如果不熟悉业务是很难领导的；二，要扩大民主，用各种方法，听取各方面的意见。从现在起，应该更多的依靠老教授办校。特别是当一件事情在设计中，要注意广泛的听取意见，在这个基础上达到集中。集中以后，不能以党代政，要充分发挥校务委员会的职权。在整风运动中，希望党委改进这些方面的领导方法和工作作风，调动一切积极因素，办好高等学校。所以今天的问题不是“教授治校”、“民主办校”所能解决的，因此，党对高等学校的领导不是削弱而是要更加加强起来。
