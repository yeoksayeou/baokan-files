Household Labor is Glorious Labor
Staff and Workers' Family Representatives Conference Calls for Strengthening Unity and Implementing the "Five Goods"

(Our newspaper dispatch) The National Staff and Workers' Family Representatives Conference concluded yesterday.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a report at the conference. In her report, she focused on the significance of household labor and its relationship to women's liberation, as well as how to help the country overcome difficulties in socialist construction. She said: With the change of social system, the nature and significance of household labor have also changed accordingly. In the old society, household labor was looked down upon and not considered glorious; under the socialist system, household labor has become labor that serves socialist construction, a necessary labor for our country's socialist construction, and therefore glorious labor. When talking about supporting the country in overcoming difficulties in construction, she emphasized that the current difficulties of the country are difficulties amidst victory, difficulties in progress, fundamentally different from the difficulties before liberation. She said that the many methods for overcoming difficulties introduced by the representatives at the conference are permeated with the spirit of overcoming difficulties through labor, and with the spirit of using the collective strength and wisdom of the masses to solve problems diligently and thriftily. With this precious spirit, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and our socialist cause will surely be victorious! Finally, she called on the representatives present to conscientiously follow the spirit of the conference, unite the broad masses of staff and workers' families, and make greater contributions to socialism.

The meeting unanimously adopted "A Letter to Staff and Workers' Families Across the Country," calling on staff and workers' families across the country to raise awareness, strengthen unity, implement the "Five Goods," strive to be good at diligence and thrift in managing the household, good at unity and mutual assistance, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, and good at studying hard, actively support production, and serve socialist construction.

The meeting also passed a telegram supporting the resolution of the Executive Bureau of the International Democratic Women's Federation on demanding disarmament, opposing the use and testing of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, and defending world peace.

This conference began on June 4th and lasted for nine consecutive days. The representatives discussed the report on family work by Yang Zhihua, Minister of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Eighty-nine representatives introduced their experiences in diligence and thrift in managing the household, educating children, mutual assistance and unity, developing sideline production, and running nurseries and spare-time cultural schools.

　　家务劳动是光荣的劳动
    职工家属代表会议号召加强团结贯彻“五好”
    本报讯  全国职工家属代表会议昨天闭幕。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅在会上作了报告。她在报告中着重谈到了家务劳动的意义和它与妇女解放的关系，以及如何帮助国家克服在社会主义建设中的困难两个问题。她说：社会制度变了，家务劳动的性质和意义也就跟着变了。在旧社会里，家务劳动是没有人看得起的，更谈不到光荣了；在社会主义制度下，家务劳动成了为社会主义建设服务的劳动，是我国社会主义建设所必需的劳动，因此是光荣的劳动。在谈到支援国家克服建设中的困难问题的时候，她强调指出：当前国家的困难是胜利中的困难，是前进中的困难，跟解放前的困难根本不同。她说，代表们在会议上介绍的很多克服困难的办法，贯串着用劳动克服困难的精神，贯串着运用群众集体的力量和智慧，克勤克俭解决问题的精神。有了这种宝贵的精神，就没有克服不了的困难，我们社会主义的事业就一定能胜利！她最后号召到会代表切实按照大会精神，团结广大职工家属，为社会主义作出更大的贡献。
    会议一致通过了“给全国职工家属的一封信”，号召全国职工家属，提高觉悟，加强团结，贯彻“五好”，做到勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养子女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好，积极支援生产，为社会主义建设服务。
    会议还通过了拥护国际民主妇女联合会执行局关于要求裁军、反对使用和试验原子武器和核武器，保卫世界和平的决议的通电。
    这次会议从6月4日开始，连续开了九天。代表们讨论了中华全国总工会女工部部长杨之华关于家属工作的报告。有八十九位代表在会上介绍了她们在勤俭持家、教养子女、互助团结、开展副业生产、举办托儿站和业余文化学校等方面的经验。
