　　Huge Man-Made Rich Iron Ore Factory
    Ansteel's New Sintering Plant Fully Operational
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 27th - Anshan Iron and Steel Company's largest man-made rich iron ore factory – the new sintering plant – was put into full production today.

    Construction of this factory began in November 1955, with the entire project carried out in two phases. The first phase was completed as early as the end of October last year.

    Next to the new sintering plant is installed China's first large-scale car dumper. The car dumper clamps and overturns a train car carrying sixty tons of iron ore powder, unloading the powder onto an underground belt conveyor system. After the work of more than a dozen automated workshops, the original powdered iron ore powder, manganese ore, limestone, etc., are sintered into blocky man-made rich iron ore – the main raw material for iron-smelting furnaces.

    Based on design capacity, this new sintering plant can produce enough man-made rich iron ore annually to smelt about 1.5 million tons of pig iron, thus greatly alleviating the supply and demand imbalance of iron-smelting raw materials that Ansteel has faced in the past few years.

    There are very abundant and high-quality lean iron ore deposits around Anshan. As early as decades ago, they attracted the attention and research of many Chinese and foreign geological experts and were called "Anshan-style" iron ore. This type of ore contains about 33% iron. So far, the portion that has been thoroughly explored is enough for Ansteel to mine and use until after the year 2000.

    In order to make full use of these resources, the state plans to build and renovate eight concentrators and sintering plants in Anshan from 1953 to 1960 to turn lean iron ore into man-made rich iron ore with an iron content of more than 60%. This plan has been successfully implemented. To date, six have been put into production, and two more are under construction or about to begin construction.

### 巨大的人造富铁矿工厂  鞍钢新烧结厂全面投入生产

　　巨大的人造富铁矿工厂
    鞍钢新烧结厂全面投入生产
    新华社鞍山27日电  鞍山钢铁公司最大的人造富铁矿工厂——新烧结厂今天全部投入生产。
    这座工厂在1955年11月开始施工，全部工程分两期进行，第一期早在去年10月底竣工。
    在新烧结厂的旁边，安装着我国第一台大型翻车机。翻车机把载着六十吨铁矿粉的一节火车皮挟起倾复，将矿粉卸入深藏地下的皮带运输装置上；经过十多个自动化车间的工作，原来是粉状的铁矿粉、锰矿、石灰石等，就被烧结成块状的人造富铁矿——炼铁炉的主要原料。
    按照设计能力计算，这座新烧结厂每年生产的人造富铁矿，能炼制一百五十万吨左右的生铁，因而可以大大缓和鞍钢过去几年一直存在的炼铁原料供不应求的情况。
    在鞍山周围有很丰富和品质优良的贫铁矿，早在几十年前就引起中、外许多地质专家的注意研究，被称为“鞍山式”铁矿，这种矿石含铁33％左右；到现在为止，已经勘探清楚的部分，即够鞍钢开采使用到公元二千年以后。
    为了充分利用这些资源，国家计划从1953年到1960年间，在鞍山新建、改建八座选矿厂和烧结厂，以便把贫铁矿变成含铁60％以上的人造富铁矿；这个计划一直被顺利地执行着，到今天已有六座投入生产，另外还有两座正在施工或即将开工建设。
