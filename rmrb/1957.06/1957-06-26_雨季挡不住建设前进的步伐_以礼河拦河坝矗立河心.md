Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 25th. China's first high-head hydropower station, the Yili River Hydropower Station, is under construction day and night during the rainy season.

Since the beginning of June, the rainy season has arrived on the Yunnan Plateau, and the floodwaters of the Yili River roar through the hydropower station construction site, discharging downstream. When night falls, thousands of mercury and electric lights illuminate the mountains at the construction site, reflecting the waves of the Yili River, which from a distance looks like a silver river appearing on a mountain more than 2,000 meters high. Under the lights, huge mast cranes extend their arms, grabbing tons of reinforced concrete blocks high up, and winches lift bucket after bucket of gravel and slag from the deep pits.

On the left bank of the Yili River, more than ten kilometers from Huize County, workers are blasting tunnels, and the rumbling explosions shake the valley. In the future, the Yili River will be diverted here, passing through the tunnel into the Jinsha River. The Yili River Hydropower Station uses the water level difference (1350 meters) between the two rivers to generate electricity. According to the design, a total of four hydropower stations are arranged on the 13.3-kilometer water diversion tunnel from the Yili River to the Jinsha River, forming a complete hydraulic hub.

Now, the powerhouse of the second-stage power station will soon be built. The concrete dam of the power station has already stood in the heart of the river.

The power generation capacity of the Yili River Hydropower Station is approximately 370,000 kilowatts, which is six times larger than that of the Shizitan Hydropower Station.

### 雨季挡不住建设前进的步伐  以礼河拦河坝矗立河心

　　雨季挡不住建设前进的步伐
    以礼河拦河坝矗立河心
    新华社昆明25日电  我国第一座高水头电站——以礼河水力发电站，正在雨季中日夜施工。
    6月初以来，雨季来到了云南高原，以礼河的洪水叫啸着经过水电站的工地向下游宣泄。当夜幕低垂，工地上几千盏水银灯和电灯照亮了山峦，映红了以礼河的波浪，远远望去，宛如两千多公尺的山上出现了一条银河。灯光下，巨大的桅杆式起重机伸开了臂腕，高高地抓起了几吨重的钢筋混凝土块，卷扬机从深坑里把一斗一斗的碎石和土渣提升。
    距会泽县城十多公里的以礼河左岸，工人们正在爆炸隧洞，隆隆的爆炸声震撼着山谷。将来，以礼河水将在这里改道，经过隧洞流入金沙江。以礼河水电站就是利用二条河流之间的水面落差（一三五○公尺）来发电的。按照设计，从以礼河到金沙江共长十三点三公里的输水隧洞上，总共布置了四个水电站，构成了一个完整的水力枢纽。
    现在，二级电站的厂房很快就要建筑起来。电站的混凝土拦河坝，已矗立在河心。
    以礼河水电站的发电能力约三十七万瓩，比狮子滩水电站的发电能力还大六倍。
