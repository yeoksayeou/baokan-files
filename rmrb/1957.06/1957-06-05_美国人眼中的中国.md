An American's View of China
By American Writer, Apé Čapek

After traveling in China for ten weeks, I am back at my desk, returning to my daily work of studying the United States. My desk is piled high with the American newspapers, magazines, and books that arrived while I was away. The drone of the airplane engines is still ringing in my ears, and I am immersed in reconnecting with the mainstream of American thought. I am reading American publications intently, which does not diminish my strong feelings about the new China. During the four thousand mile journey in the new China, the scenes of China, the fresh scenes, are deeply engraved in my consciousness and heart, and now they are emerging in front of my eyes, forming many meaningful pictures. At the same time, I feel a new sensitivity to everything mentioned in American publications about China and Asia.

China has now become a center of debate in the United States. I would now like to join the current American discussion of China issues based on my visit to China.

American Public Opinion Demands to Know the Truth About China

The biggest thing Americans lack when discussing China is realistic firsthand observation. Most American newspapers now feel this serious deficiency caused by the State Department's ban on American journalists visiting China. The three American journalists who entered China in December 1956 won the support of the American press and most American newspapers for their challenge to this ban. An editorial in the Louisville, Kentucky "Courier-Journal" expressed the attitude of most American newspapers and was entered into the Congressional Record of January 13, 1957, by Congressman William Natcher of that state. This editorial, entitled "Journalists Should Challenge News Ban," stated: "The practical effect of the ban on journalists visiting China is that this country (the United States) and its officials have been subjected to hearsay and indirect reports for eight long years in dealing with a vast region that is related to the future peace of the world. Now is the time to challenge the ban."

The widespread domestic opposition to this ban is only one aspect of the growing demands of Americans to adopt a realistic policy toward the new China. Americans of various political views increasingly feel that the United States, for its own interests, cannot treat the most populous country in the world, which has a decisive position in Asia, solely on the basis of unfounded fantasies. A careful reading of the American press reveals that American policy toward China is causing increasing domestic unease, and American public opinion, representing a large segment of the population, has the view that something is wrong with Washington's view of China.

Edmund Clubb, who spent twenty years in the Far East as an American diplomat, reviewed American female journalist Agnes Smedley's introduction to China in the January 19, 1957 issue of "The Nation." The most interesting point of this book review is that it exposes the conflict between an American who served as an American diplomatic representative in Asia for many years and the current US government's policy toward China. Mr. Clubb uses careful wording to avoid a direct conflict with Washington, but he correctly describes the official American attitude toward China as "our hostile symptoms toward China." Mr. Clubb recommended the book to all Americans "willing to see through one of the great social transformations in human history - the Chinese Revolution" on the grounds that "the Chinese Revolution needs to be deeply understood by the United States."

The fact is simple: if we do not understand the Chinese Revolution, the roots of the new China, and the fact that the People's Republic has broader support than any government in China's long and complex history, it is impossible to understand the path of human history, the new trends in Asia and Africa, and even more impossible for the United States to find a way out of the current diplomatic dilemma and crisis in Asia.

The Public Begins to Doubt China Policy

The new China is consolidated. It is not an experiment, nor a historical fantasy, nor an accident that can be blown down by winds from Taiwan or elsewhere. For many years, the Chinese market has attracted American businessmen, and now it has greater purchasing power and stability than ever before. Even the enemies of the new China do not hesitate to admit that China's economy has made incalculable progress. China's position and reputation in Asia and the world have reached unprecedented heights. Some of these facts have prompted American public opinion to begin to awaken. This is why new questions have arisen as to whether it is wise to isolate the United States from a great country with which it once had many ties, simply because some high-ranking Americans do not like the fact that six hundred million Chinese people have chosen what they believe is the best path for themselves.

After returning from my visit to China, when I began to read American publications, taking advantage of my familiarity with the actual situation in China firsthand, one of the things that saddened me the most was that some serious American publications, which were trying to understand the complex world in which we live, were misled by some incorrect reports about China and led astray.

I was surprised when I read the latest issue of "The Virginia Quarterly Review," one of the most famous American university quarterlies. In this issue, C.E. Black, a professor at Princeton University who previously served in the State Department, reviewed a new book published by Harvard University Press, "American Politics in a Changing World," by former US Ambassador to India, Chester Bowles. The book is a collection of lectures given by former Ambassador Bowles at Harvard University in 1956.

According to Professor Black, one of the arguments of this book is that there are "two modern methods" being followed in the world today. "One method is inspired by Western democracies... The other method is the communist method, which achieves forced capital formation by systematically lowering living standards and suppressing human rights for the sake of industrial production and national interests. China is an example of the second method..."

What we are now dealing with is something within the scope of American academia: a lecture given at Harvard University, reviewed by a Princeton University professor in a journal published by the University of Virginia, but lacking the simplest thing, the accuracy of facts, which is the foundation of all scholarship. As I read this book, the starkly different Chinese landscape, scene after scene, flashed before my eyes.

Epoch-Making Economic Development

Time: Late January 1957. Place: A village in Kunming, Yunnan Province, where the seasons are like spring. At an ordinary table in the office of the agricultural cooperative, I was drinking flower tea with several cooperative members and talking about the past and present lives of the farmers. A woman in charge of township government work, pointing to her new shoes, said that in the past she could only afford straw sandals, and after they established the cooperative, she bought her first real pair of shoes. She is one of 60% of the farmers in this county who were previously ruled by landlords and subjected to the Kuomintang's heavy taxes and levies. They worked hard all year round but could not feed themselves. In addition to working in the fields, they had to go up the mountains to cut firewood in exchange for rice. Chronic hunger and insufficient clothing were the traditional living standards. For a century, China had been known as "the land of famine."

Of the eight hundred and eighty-three farming households in that township, only ninety-two lacked grain. By 1956, all farm households produced enough grain to eat for the whole year. If this situation is extrapolated to one hundred million farm households, plus the large amounts of clothing purchased by farmers over the past few years, you can see epoch-making economic development. Chinese farmers have been liberated from their long-term enemy—hunger. This does not rely on miracles, nor does it happen overnight. It was achieved through years of careful planning and hard work, through land reform and the new path of cooperation. Any child in any village in China can show you the growth in the living standards of rural China. So how can American publications allow themselves to stray from the truth and say that China is "lowering living standards"?

I recalled another scene, at a textile factory in Beijing, a new factory where all the textile machines were made in China. The vast majority of workers in this factory were young workers participating in work for the first time. But as I walked among the many looms, I also talked to older female workers who had worked in textile factories in Shanghai in the past. They pointed out that in the new China, their wages have increased, they have much better working conditions, their purchasing power has increased, and they have new labor insurance. 1956 was a year of wage increases for Chinese workers. – Industrialization and improved living standards go hand in hand, and this improvement is not only for millions of people, but for hundreds of millions of people. The living standards of the broad masses of the Chinese people are still low compared with advanced industrial countries such as the United States, and the backward situation will still exist until China completes modernization and industrialization. But China's progress can only be measured based on what it had when it started a new page, and what it has achieved in the short span of seven years.

For a century, foreign capital in China could do whatever it wanted, and Western democracies had ample opportunities to show that they could contribute to China. But for a century, the result of foreign capital rampaging in China has only deepened the poverty of the Chinese people and aroused the Chinese people's struggle for national independence. The Chinese people deeply understand this historical experience, and inappropriate comments about China's first government to improve the living standards of the broad masses of the people will only cause Americans to lose friends in China.

The Path Chosen by the People Themselves

As for human rights, the simplest fact is that no government that inherited the Kuomintang could suppress human rights, because human rights simply did not exist during the Kuomintang's rule. American eyewitnesses who have been to China have confirmed this in many writings: workers, farmers, women, ethnic minorities, democratic students and intellectuals—the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people were outside the bounds of human rights and civil rights. Comparing what I see in China today with what I know about the past, it is clear that the short era of the new China is the era of the birth of human rights for the majority of the Chinese people. For the first time in China's long history, thirty-six million ethnic minorities have gained equal status; three hundred million Chinese women have mobilized to realize their equal rights; five hundred million farmers have broken free from feudal shackles; the state power has been transferred to the hands of an alliance of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, which can only be objectively described as the largest reform of human rights and democracy in human history.

When you see firsthand how China is building socialism, the most striking thing is the pure characteristics of the Chinese reform movement. This is the concrete realization in life of the old American dream of "government of the people, by the people, for the people." The leaders who are guiding China's transition to socialism know that they cannot drag six hundred million people into socialism against their will. In my opinion, their attitude towards the people can be summed up in Whitman's poem:

Not I, nor anyone else can travel that road for you,
You must travel it for yourself.

No one can stop the Chinese people from moving forward on the path they have chosen for themselves. As long as the American people understand the actual situation in China, the vast majority of people will undoubtedly say: New China, we salute you! We welcome your rapid advancement into a new era of human rights and improved living standards for the people. (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Lin Longtie)

### 美国人眼中的中国

    美国人眼中的中国
    美国作家　阿培·查佩克
    在中国旅行十个星期以后，我又坐在我的书桌前，回到我研究美国的日常工作中去。我的桌上堆满了我不在家时来的大批美国报纸、刊物和书籍。飞机的引擎声虽然仍在耳里嗡嗡地响着，我又埋头进行和美国思想主流恢复联系。我专心阅读美国刊物，并不因而就冲淡了我对新中国强烈的感受。在新中国四千英里旅途中，中国的景象，新鲜的景象，深深地铭刻在我的意识和心灵中，现在它们又涌现在我的眼前，构成了许多富有意义的图画。同时，我感到对美国刊物中提到的关于中国及亚洲的每一种事情，有了一种新的敏感。
    目前中国已成为美国国内的辩论中心。现在我愿意根据我对中国的访问，加入目前美国对中国问题的讨论。
    美国舆论要求了解中国真相
    美国人讨论中国问题时最感缺乏的，就是现实的第一手观察。大多数美国报纸现在已经感到国务院禁止美国记者访华所造成的这种严重的缺陷。1956年12月进入中国的三个美国新闻记者，向这项禁令的挑战赢得了美国新闻界人士和大多数美国报纸的支持。肯塔基州路易斯威尔市“信使日报”的一篇社论，表达了大多数美国报纸的态度，并且被该州国会议员威廉·纳特策尔载入1957年1月13日的国会记录中。这篇“新闻记者应该向新闻禁令挑战”的社论说：“新闻记者访华这一件事的实际影响，已使这个国家（美国）和它的官员在八年长的时间里，在对待一个关系世界未来和平的广大地区时，受着传闻与间接报道的摆布。现在是向禁令挑战的时候了。”
    美国国内普遍反对这项禁令，只不过是越来越多的美国人重新提出的、美国应对新中国采取现实政策的要求的一个方面。各种不同政治观点的美国人日益感到，美国为了自身的利益，不能仅凭毫无根据的幻想来对待在亚洲有决定地位的、人口居世界首位的国家。仔细阅读美国报刊，就会发现美国对华政策越来越引起国内舆论巨大的不安，代表很大一部分人的美国舆论产生了一种看法，华盛顿对华观点出了毛病。
    曾经在远东度过二十年，担任美国外交官员的爱蒙德·克拉布，在1957年1月19日一期的“民族周刊”上评论了美国女记者史沫特莱的介绍中国情况的著作。这篇书评最有趣的一点，就是它暴露了一个曾在亚洲担任美国外交代表并且有了多年经验的美国人和美国政府的现行对华政策的冲突。克拉布先生措辞谨慎，尽量避免和华盛顿作正面冲突，但是他正确地将美国官方对华态度描写为“我们敌视中国的征象。”克拉布先生根据“中国革命需要被美国深入了解”的理由，向一切“愿意透视人类历史上伟大的社会转变之一——中国革命”的美国人，推荐了这本书。
    事实很简单，如果对中国革命，对新中国的根源，以及对人民共和国比中国悠久和复杂的历史上的任何一个政府，获得更广大的支持的事实都不了解，也就不可能了解人类历史的道路、亚非的新趋势，更不可能使美国在亚洲找到一条可以摆脱目前外交政策的困境和危机的道路。
    公众开始怀疑对华政策
    新中国是巩固的。它不是一种试验，也不是历史的狂想，更不是能被台湾或其他地方刮来的风可以吹倒的偶然事件。许多年来，中国市场吸引了美国商人，现在它比任何时期具有更大的购买力和稳定性。即使新中国的敌人也不犹豫地承认，中国的经济已获得无法估计的进展。中国在亚洲和世界的地位及声誉，已达到空前高峰。其中一些事实促使美国公众舆论开始醒悟过来。这就是为什么对仅由于某些身居高位的美国人不喜欢六亿中国人民选择他们自己认为最好的道路，而将美国和一个曾经有过种种联系的伟大国家割离的这种政策，产生了是否明智的新疑问的原因。
    在访问中国回来之后，根据我熟悉第一手的中国实际情况的有利条件，开始阅读美国出版物时，最使我难过的一件事，就是一些企图了解我们生活的复杂世界的一些严肃的美国刊物，竟被一些对中国不正确的报道所蒙蔽，并且被引入歧途。
    当我阅读最著名的美国大学季刊之一，最新的一期“弗琴尼亚季刊”时，使我感到惊讶。在这一期里，过去曾在国务院服务的普林斯顿大学教授C·E布来克，评论了哈佛大学出版社出版的前美国驻印大使鲍尔士著的“在变动的世界里的美国政治”的一本新书。这本书收集了前大使鲍尔士1956年在哈佛大学讲学时的一系列演讲。
    据布来克教授说，这本书的论文之一，就是目前世界上所遵循的“两种现代化的方式”。“一种方式是从西方民主国家得到启发……另一种方式就是共产主义的方式，为了工业生产和国家的利益，有计划地降低生活水平和抑制人权来达到强制的资本构成。中国就是第二种方式的范例……”
    我们现在所涉及的是美国学术的范围内的事情：在哈佛大学发表的演讲，由一位普林斯顿大学教授在弗琴尼亚大学办的刊物上发表评论，但是却缺少了一件最简单的东西，就是事实的准确性，它是各种学术的基础。当我在阅读这本书时，截然不同的中国景况，一幕幕地掠过我的眼前。
    划时代的经济发展
    时间：1957年1月底。地点：云南省四季如春的昆明的一个村庄里。在农业合作社办事处一张普通的桌旁，我和几个社员一面喝着花茶，一面谈着过去和现在农民的生活情况。负责乡政府工作的一个妇女，指着她脚上的新鞋说，过去她只买得起草鞋，在他们建立了合作社之后，她才买了第一双真正的鞋子。她是这个县60％农民中的一个，过去受到地主的统治和国民党的苛捐杂税，他们终年忙碌也无法养活自己。他们除在地里劳动外，还要上山砍柴去换米。慢性的饥饿和衣不蔽体就是传统的生活水平。一个世纪来，中国曾以“饥荒的地方”闻名。
    那一个乡里的八百八十三户农民中，只有九十二户缺粮。到了1956年，所有农户都生产了够全年吃的粮食。如果将这一情况按一亿农户来推算，再加上过去几年来农民购买的大量衣著，你就可以看到了划时代的经济发展。中国农民已经从他们的长期敌人——饥饿中解放出来。这并不依靠奇迹，也不是在一夜工夫出现的。它是经过多年的周密计划和辛勤劳动，通过土改和合作化新道路的手段才实现的。在中国任何村庄的任何一个孩子，都可以向你表明中国农村生活水平的增长。那么，美国刊物怎能允许自己远离真理而说中国“降低生活”呢？
    我忆起了另一幕景象，在北京的一个纺织工厂，这是一个新工厂，全部纺织机器都是中国自己制造的。这个工厂的绝大部分工人都是第一次参加工作的年青工人。但是当我在许多织布机中间行走时，我也和过去曾在上海的纺织工厂工作过的年纪较大的女工谈话。她们指出了在新中国里，她们的工资提高了，她们有了好得多的工作条件，她们的购买力增加了，还有她们的新的劳动保险。1956年是中国工人工资增加的一年。——工业化和提高生活水平携手并进，这提高不仅是对千万人，而且是对亿万人。中国广大人民的生活水平和先进工业国家譬如美国比较，仍然是低的，在中国完成现代化和工业化之前，落后的情况还会存在。但是中国的进步，只能根据当它开始新的一页时它有什么，和它在短短的七年中取得了什么成绩来衡量。
    一世纪来，外国资本在中国可以畅所欲为，西方民主国家有着广泛机会来表明他们能够对中国有所贡献。但是一个世纪来，外国资本在中国横冲直撞的结果，只有加深中国人民的贫困，并且激起了中国人民争取民族独立的斗争。中国人民深深体会这种历史经验，对中国第一个提高广大人民群众生活水平的政府的不恰当的议论，只会使美国人在中国丧失朋友。
    人民自己选择的道路
    至于人权，最简单的事实就是继承国民党的任何政府都不可能抑低人权，因为在国民党统治时期，人权根本就不存在。曾经到过中国的美国目击者，在许多的著作中证实了这一点：工人、农民、妇女、少数民族、民主的学生和知识分子——压倒多数的中国人民都在人权和民权的界限以外。拿我今天在中国所看到的与我所了解的过去情况相比较，很明显，新中国短短的纪元，就是大多数中国人民的人权诞生的纪元。在中国悠久的历史上，三千六百万少数民族第一次获得平等地位；三亿中国妇女动员起来实现了她们的平等权利；五亿农民摆脱了封建枷锁；国家政权转到工人、农民、知识分子和民族资产阶级的联盟手中，都只能客观地说明这是人类历史上最大一次的人权和民主的改革。
    当你亲眼看到中国如何在建设社会主义时，最引人注目的就是中国改革运动的纯朴的特点。这是美国古老的梦想“民有、民治和民享”在生活中的具体实现。引导中国过渡到社会主义的领袖们知道，不能违背六亿人民的自愿，把他们拖入社会主义。依我看来，他们对待人民的态度，惠特曼的诗句可以总括：
    不是我，不是别的任何人能够替你走那条道路，
    你必须为你自己来走它。
    谁也不能阻止中国人民在他们自己所选择的道路上迈进。只要美国人民了解中国的实际情况，绝大部分人无疑地会说：新中国，我们向你致敬！我们欢迎你迅速地迈进一个人权和提高人民生活水平的新纪元。　（本报特约稿　林龙铁译）
