Active and constructive criticism is always needed for the people's cause. The Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement is a systematic movement of criticism and self-criticism. To encourage criticism and dispel the concerns of critics, the Party pointed out in its instructions on the rectification movement that it must resolutely implement the principle of "Say all you know, say it without reservation; the speaker is not to be blamed, and the listener is to take it as a warning; correct mistakes if you have committed them, and guard against them if you have not." Any criticism aimed at strengthening the socialist cause, strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, and strengthening the unity between the Party and the people, no matter how sharp, should be warmly welcomed. Any suppression of such criticism, any retaliation against critics, is completely wrong and must be resolutely opposed. "Good medicine tastes bitter but is good for the disease, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but benefits conduct." Every Communist Party member should remember these two ancient Chinese sayings.

Perfectly well-intentioned criticism may not be correct, or not completely correct. In such cases, appropriate explanations, that is, appropriate counter-criticism, are needed. Clearly, correct counter-criticism does not hinder the development of criticism. It has nothing in common with the suppression of criticism or retaliation against critics. Allowing correct counter-criticism is perfectly normal, and prohibiting correct counter-criticism is abnormal.

As for criticism that is not well-intentioned, criticism aimed at undermining the socialist cause, undermining the people's democratic dictatorship, and undermining the unity between the Party and the people, this does not conform to the interests of the people and does not conform to the interests of the Party's rectification movement. It is all the more necessary to carry out correct counter-criticism against such destructive criticism.

Some people borrow existing terms from academic and cultural policies to call the development of all kinds of criticism "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend, letting a hundred flowers bloom," or simply "Great blooming and contending." There is nothing wrong with this borrowing. But since it is called "contending" and "blooming," it goes without saying that it should allow the expression of one opinion as well as the expression of another, allow criticism as well as counter-criticism. Otherwise, what "contending" and "blooming" are there to speak of?

However, in the current rectification movement, there has emerged such a bad, even extremely bad, sign, that is, some people are trying their best to prevent others from expressing opinions different from their own. The incident of Lu Yuwen receiving threatening letters is one example. The incident of Shu Zongqiao and others from Fudan University in Shanghai obstructing Da Yijin from speaking, as reported in today's newspaper, is also an example.

There are indeed some people who praise "blooming and contending" in words, but in reality, they try to let only themselves speak and not allow others to respond. They can dismiss the principles of Marxism as "dogma" and denigrate socialist institutions and organizations as "bureaucratic." According to them, expressing such opinions counts as "blooming and contending." However, if someone comes out to point out that their statement actually negates Marxism and negates socialism, they immediately say: "Why are you explaining? Isn't this hindering the enthusiasm of the masses to 'bloom and contend'?" "We are helping the Party with rectification. Isn't all criticism, even if it is incorrect, beneficial to the Party?" They say: "You say I have misrepresented the facts? Why don't you 'correct mistakes if you have committed them, and guard against them if you have not'?" In addition to these questions, there are also people (such as Chen Mingshu) who advise from the front: "Only talk about shortcomings, not advantages, that is in line with the 'spirit of rectification'!" The implication is that those who talk about both shortcomings and advantages, those who talk about both mistakes and achievements, and those who come out to answer and debate, are all obstacles to "rectification." Thus, they shut the other party's mouth, or at least put the other party in a position where answering is "not being modest."

Everyone, think about it, is this called "helping the Party with rectification"? A doctor arbitrarily exaggerates and misjudges people's conditions, announcing that so-and-so is dying and so-and-so is incurable; if someone says, I have some minor illnesses, but I am basically healthy, and the condition you described does not correspond to the facts, the doctor says, this proves that you are unwilling to be treated, that you are attacking the doctor's enthusiasm, that this proves you are beyond help. Can there be such unreasonable doctors in the world?

Since the beginning of the rectification movement, a large part of the criticisms and suggestions put forward to the Party and the government are correct and must be listened to, studied, and adopted. However, many erroneous statements that are detrimental to the socialist cause have also appeared. For example, there are now people who are advocating that the leadership of the Communist Party should be abolished, some are cursing that socialist construction has gone completely wrong, and some are advocating the "justice" of extending capitalist exploitation for another twenty years, and so on. Since there are these two different kinds of criticism, then everyone who is responsible for the people's cause cannot blindly and indiscriminately say that all criticisms are beneficial to the people, and cannot fail to raise counter-arguments to those erroneous and destructive "criticisms." Without counter-criticism for erroneous opinions, without debate, not only will the truth not be clarified, but the socialist cause will inevitably be harmed. Mr. Deng Chumin said, "After great blooming and contending, there must be great debate," which is completely correct. Our socialist transformation has only been basically completed, the class struggle has not ended, and bourgeois ideology is still fighting for positions and leadership in all aspects with proletarian ideology. In this situation, in our debate, we must use the Marxist method of class analysis to reveal the essence of various criticisms, otherwise we cannot correctly understand them and correctly treat them.

There are some people who do not approve of counter-criticism. They give a name to the counter-criticism that may appear in advance, calling it "tightening." For example, some people in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily have already said: "There are recent signs of 'tightening'." Many people say this out of misunderstanding, but some people have other intentions. If someone calls the criticism that suits their own wishes "loosening," and calls the counter-criticism that does not suit their wishes "tightening," calls saying the opposite "loosening," and calls saying the positive "tightening," and even want to scold and threaten those who say the positive, then people cannot help but ask: Where is the people's freedom of speech, first of all, is the socialist freedom of speech of the working people? If the socialist freedom of speech of the working class is not allowed to be "loosened," then are those who so-called support "loosening," are they not implementing "tightening" on the socialist freedom of speech of the working class? We believe that for the benefit of the people, all statements that are beneficial to socialism must be greatly loosened and especially loosened, can only be loosened, and cannot be tightened!

Truth is not afraid of refutation, and what is afraid of refutation is not truth. Being afraid of criticism is cowardice, and being afraid of counter-criticism is also cowardice. Not allowing criticism is autocratic; not allowing counter-criticism, is it not also autocratic? To eliminate autocracy, criticism and counter-criticism cannot be neglected. In order to overcome the shortcomings in the socialist cause and overcome the shortcomings in the Party's work, we must continue to broaden the channels of speech, resolutely carry out active and constructive criticism, and continue to resolutely eliminate any obstacles to beneficial criticism. At the same time, in order to safeguard the socialist cause and oppose those "criticisms" that undermine socialism, we must resolutely carry out correct counter-criticism. Only in this way can the Party's rectification movement develop in a healthy way.

### 要有积极的批评，也要有正确的反批评

    要有积极的批评，也要有正确的反批评
    积极的、建设性的批评，对于人民的事业是永远需要的。中国共产党的整风运动，就是一个有系统的批评和自我批评的运动。为了鼓励批评，为了打破批评者的顾虑，党在整风运动的指示中指出，必须坚决实行“知无不言，言无不尽；言者无罪，闻者足戒；有则改之，无则加勉”的原则。只要是目的在于加强社会主义事业、加强人民民主专政、加强党和人民的团结的批评，无论怎样尖锐，都应该受到热烈的欢迎。对于这样的批评的任何压制，对于批评者的任何打击报复，都是完全错误的，都必须坚决反对。“良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行”，这两句中国的古话，每一个共产党员都应该牢记勿忘。
    完全善意的批评，也可以并不正确，或者不完全正确。在这样的情况下，就需要作适当的解释，也就是适当的反批评。很明显，正确的反批评并不妨碍批评的开展。它同对于批评的压制，同对于批评者的打击报复，毫无共同之处。允许正确的反批评是完全正常的，禁止正确的反批评才是不正常的。
    至于并非善意的批评，目的在于破坏社会主义事业、破坏人民民主专政、破坏党和人民的团结的批评，这就并不合于人民的利益，并不合于党的整风运动的利益。对于这种破坏性的批评进行正确的反批评，自然更为必要了。
    有人借用对于学术文化政策上的现成的术语，把各色各样的批评的开展也叫做“百家争鸣，百花齐放”，或者简称为“大鸣大放”之类。这种借用，并无不可。但是既然叫做“争鸣”，叫做“齐放”，顾名思义，当然应该既容许发表这一种意见，也容许发表那一种意见，既容许批评，也容许反批评。否则，还有什么“争鸣”“齐放”之可言呢？
    但是，在目前的整风运动中，恰恰出现了这样一种不好的、甚至是极端恶劣的迹象，就是有人在竭力企图制止别人发表和自己不同的意见。卢郁文接到恐吓信的事件，就是一个例子。今天本报所载上海复旦大学舒宗侨等人阻挠笪移今发言的事件，也是一个例子。
    现在确实有一些口口声声称赞“齐放”“争鸣”的人，实际上企图只让他们自己讲话，而不让别人答辩。他们可以把马克思主义的道理一概封之为“教条”，把社会主义的制度和机构一概贬之为“官僚主义”的制度和机构。照他们说来，发表这种意见就算做“鸣”“放”。可是，如果有人出来指出他们这种说法实际上是否定马克思主义，否定社会主义，他们就立刻说：“你为什么出来解释，难道这不是妨碍群众‘鸣’‘放’的积极性么？”“我们是在帮助党整风呀，一切批评，即使不正确，难道不都是对党有益的么？”他们说：“你说我弄错了事实吗？为什么你不‘有则改之，无则加勉’呢？”除了这些质问之外，也还有人（例如陈铭枢）从正面劝勉道：“光说缺点，不说优点，这才合乎‘整风精神’呀！”言下之意，那种既说缺点又说优点、既说错误又说成绩的人，还有那些出来解答和辩论的人，就都是“整风”的挡路者了。于是，他们就把对方的嘴一下封住，至少也是把对方放到一个如果答辩就是“不虚心”的地位上去了。
    大家想想，难道这就叫做“帮助党整风”么？一个医生任意地夸大和错误地判断人们的病情，宣布某某人已经垂危，某某人已经不治；如果某人说，我虽有些小病，基本上还是健康的，你所说的病情并不符合事实，医生就说，这就证明你不愿意治病，打击医生积极性，这就证明你已经无可救药。天下难道可以有这样不讲道理的医生么？
    从整风运动开始以来，已经提出来的对于党和政府的批评和建议，很大部分是正确的，是必须加以倾听、研究和采纳的。可是，不利于社会主义事业的错误言论也出现了不少。例如，现在就有人在宣传应该取消共产党的领导，有人在咒骂社会主义建设全部搞错了，有人在宣扬再延长资本主义剥削到二十年之久的“正义性”，等等。既然有这两种不同的批评，那么，每一个对人民事业负责的人，就不能胡里胡涂、不加区别地把一切批评都说成是对人民有益的，就不能不对那些错误的、破坏性的“批评”提出反驳的意见。对于错误意见没有反批评，不进行辩论，不仅不能把道理弄清，而且必然使社会主义事业受到损害。邓初民先生说，“大鸣大放之后，必须大争”，这是完全正确的。我国的社会主义改造才基本完成，阶级斗争并未结束，资产阶级思想还在各方面和无产阶级思想争夺阵地和领导权。在这种情况下，我们在辩论当中，就不能不用马克思主义的阶级分析的方法，揭示出各种批评的实质，否则我们就不能正确地认识它们和正确地对待它们。
    有一种不赞成反批评的人，他们把可能会出现的反批评预先起个名字叫做“收”。例如上海文汇报上就已经有人说：“最近有点‘收’的迹象”。这样说的人，许多人是出于误解，但是也有人是另有用意。如果有人把合于自己心意的批评叫做“放”，把不符合他们心意的反批评就叫做“收”，把说反面话叫做“放”，把说正面话就叫做“收”，甚至还要对说正面话的人横加谩骂和恐吓，那么人们不能不问：人民的言论自由，首先是劳动人民的社会主义的言论自由，究竟是在哪里呢？如果劳动人民的社会主义的言论自由不许“放”，那么，那些所谓拥护“放”的人，对劳动人民的社会主义的言论自由，不是在实行“收”么？我们认为，为了人民的利益，一切有利于社会主义的言论都必须大放而特放，只能放，不能收！
    真理是不怕驳的，怕驳的就不是真理。害怕批评是怯懦，害怕反批评也是怯懦。不许批评是专横；不许反批评，又何尝不是专横？要去掉专横，批评和反批评就不能偏废。为了克服社会主义事业中的缺点，克服党的工作中的缺点，我们必须继续广开言路，坚决地开展积极的建设性的批评，继续坚决地扫除对于有益的批评的任何障碍。同时，为了维护社会主义事业，反对那些破坏社会主义的“批评”，必须坚决地开展正确的反批评。只有这样，党的整风运动才能得到健康的发展。
