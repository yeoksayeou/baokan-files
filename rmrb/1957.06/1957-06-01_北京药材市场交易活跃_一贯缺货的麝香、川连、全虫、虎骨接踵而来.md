    Active Transactions in Beijing's Medicinal Herb Market
    Previously Scarce Musk, Coptis chinensis, Whole Scorpions, and Tiger Bone Arrive in Succession
    Transactions in Beijing's free market for medicinal herbs are becoming more active day by day. The transaction amount at the end of April was only over 10,000 yuan, but by late May it had increased to over 110,000 yuan. At the end of April, only ten-odd kinds of medicinal materials were traded, including musk, American ginseng, amber, agarwood, Cornus officinalis, cinnabar, white pepper, bird's nest, and some sporadic deer antlers, ginseng, and sandalwood. By mid-May, the medicinal materials traded exceeded seventy kinds. Among the medicinal materials traded in May were Coptis chinensis, Achyranthes bidentata, whole scorpions, and Bombyx batryticatus, which had been in short supply. Merchants participating in the transaction came from Tibet, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Singapore, and other places.
    Beijing's free market for medicinal herbs has brought great convenience to medicinal herb merchants from other places. Tibetan medicinal merchant Luo Sang Zhajun, who carried more than 41 jin of musk, said that if Beijing did not have a free market for medicinal herbs, he would have to take the musk to Guangzhou to sell and then bring money back to Beijing to purchase the goods he wanted to transport back. Two merchants from Neixiang, Henan, quickly sold the Cornus officinalis they transported in this market, and then transported a second batch of Cornus officinalis. Several overseas Chinese who sold medicinal materials were also very satisfied with this market.
    Medicinal herb merchants can not only quickly sell various medicinal materials in this market, but also get reasonable prices. The transaction price of the musk brought by Tibetan merchant Luo Sang Zhajun was almost the same as the estimated price. Although the Beijing Medicinal Materials Company stipulates the listed prices for purchasing medicinal materials, the listed prices are only used as a reference for the free market. The transaction price of medicinal materials in the free market can be higher (or lower) than the company's listed price based on foreign prices and local supply and demand. For example, the Beijing Medicinal Materials Company's listed price for purchasing musk is 58 yuan per liang, while the prices of the three musk transactions in the free market were 82 yuan, 98 yuan, and 120 yuan per liang.
    Musk, Cornus officinalis, Coptis chinensis, Achyranthes bidentata, whole scorpions, tiger bone, etc., some are out of stock, and some have been in tight supply for a long time. Many traditional Chinese medicine stores lack these medicinal materials, so dozens of prepared medicines cannot be prepared, and many decoctions cannot be fully prepared. Now, most of the traditional Chinese medicine industry here has obtained the long-awaited raw materials. ·Zhao Qi·

### 北京药材市场交易活跃  一贯缺货的麝香、川连、全虫、虎骨接踵而来

    北京药材市场交易活跃
    一贯缺货的麝香、川连、全虫、虎骨接踵而来
    北京药材自由市场的交易一天比一天活跃了。4月底的成交金额只一万多元，5月下旬增加到十一万多元。4月底成交的药材只有：麝香、洋参、琥珀、沉香、山萸肉、碯砂、白胡椒、燕窝和一些零星的鹿茸、人参、檀香等共十多种，到5月中旬成交的药材超过七十种。5月间成交的药材中，有一向缺货的川连、牛夕、全虫和白僵蚕等。参加交易的商人，来自西藏、广东、广西、河南、四川、甘肃、青海、黑龙江、辽宁和新加坡等地。
    北京市的药材自由市场，给外地药材商人带来了很大的便利。携带四十一斤多麝香的藏族药商罗桑扎君表示，如果北京没有药材自由市场，他就要把麝香带到广州去卖，然后带钱回北京采购他要运回去的货物。两个河南内乡的商人，由于在这个市场上很快地卖出了运来的药材——山萸肉，随后又运来了第二批山萸肉。几个出售药材的华侨，也很满意这种市场。
    药材商人们在这个市场上不仅可以很快卖出各种药材，而且可以得到合理的价格。藏族商人罗桑扎君带来的麝香，成交价和预估价差不多。北京市药材公司虽然规定了收购药材的牌价，但是牌价只作为自由市场的参考。自由市场的药材成交价格可以根据外地价格、当地供求情况，高于（或低于）公司牌价。例如，北京市药材公司收购麝香的牌价是每市两五十八元，而自由市场上成交的三宗麝香的每两价格，则是：八十二元、九十八元、一百二十元。
    麝香、山萸肉、川连、牛夕、全虫、虎骨等，有些是脱销的，有些是长期供应紧张的。许多国药店由于缺乏这些药材，有几十种成药不能配制，有许多汤剂不能配齐，现在，这里的国药业大部分得到了盼望已久的原料。　·赵起·
