    The "Selfless" Person
  There is such a kind of "selfless" comrade:
  When he solicits opinions from the masses, he often uses the following tone:
  "What opinions do you have about our group?"
  "What opinions do you have about the section?"
  "What opinions do you have about the organization?"
  "What opinions do you have about the Party?"
  "What opinions do you have about our social system?"
  When he gives opinions to superiors, he often uses
  the following tone:
  "This is the opinion of the group."
  "This is the opinion of the section."
  "This is the opinion of the masses."
  "This is the opinion of all of us."
  When he criticizes the masses, he often uses the following tone:
  "Others have this view of you."
  "People generally feel this way."
  "The masses are all saying this."

    “忘我”的人
  有这样一种“忘我”的同志：
  当他征求群众的意见时，常常用这样的口气：
  “你对我们组有什么意见？”
  “你对科里有什么意见？”
  “你对组织有什么意见？”
  “你对党有什么意见？”
  “你对我们的社会制度有什么意见？”
  当他给上级提意见时，常常用
  这样的口气：
  “这是组里的意见。”
  “这是科里的意见。”
  “这是群众的意见。”
  “这是我们大家的意见。”
  当他批评群众时常常用这样的口气：
  “别人对你有这种看法。”
  “人家都有这种感觉。”
  “群众都这么说。”
