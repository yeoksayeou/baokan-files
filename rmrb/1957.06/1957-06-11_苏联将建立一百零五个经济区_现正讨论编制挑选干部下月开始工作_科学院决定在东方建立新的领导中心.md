　　The Soviet Union Will Establish 105 Economic Zones
　　Drafting and Selection of Cadres is Under Discussion, Work to Begin Next Month
　　Academy of Sciences Decides to Establish New Leadership Center in the East
　　(Dispatch from our newspaper, Moscow, 10th) Following the closing of the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics have successively held meetings to determine the specific measures for the establishment of economic zones and national economic committees. The Russian Federal Republic has decided to establish 70 economic zones, the Ukrainian Republic 11, the Kazakh Republic 9, the Uzbek Republic 4, and the other republics 1 each, totaling 105. All economic zones are now busily organizing national economic committees, discussing staffing, and selecting cadres so that they can begin work on July 1st.
　　The structure and personnel of the Moscow (City) Economic Zone National Economic Committee have been arranged. Now, the various administrative bureaus of the National Economic Committee are preparing to take over enterprises from various industrial ministries. The Moscow Economic Zone will govern more than 500 factories, producing a wide variety of industrial products from machines to fabrics. To lead these enterprises, 20 administrative bureaus have been established within the National Economic Committee. In addition to factories, they also lead scientific research institutes, laboratories, and design groups. A characteristic of the new institutions is the consolidation of similar enterprises to strengthen the specialization of production. For example, Moscow has 30 factories manufacturing instruments, previously managed by 11 industrial ministries. Now, they will be managed by a single instrument manufacturing administration bureau, making closer division of labor and cooperation possible. This is one aspect. On the other hand, a bureau for specialization and collaboration has been established within the new institution to be responsible for the connections between enterprises of various administrative bureaus, the connections between industries in this economic zone and other economic zones, and the development of specialization of factories in this zone.
　　The National Economic Committee of the Leningrad Economic Zone will be formed on the 15th. The structure, including more than 20 bureaus, has been determined, and leading cadres have been selected. Only the staffing is still undergoing final review. The new institution will be lean and flexible, ready to take over 650 factories. It is expected that the specialization of Leningrad's industry will be thoroughly improved after the reorganization. For example, forgings, castings, etc., can be produced centrally, whereas they are now produced in 80 scattered factories, so production capacity cannot be fully utilized, and product costs are high. The production specialization problems of 125 enterprises are being studied. There are now 100 forging workshops, which can be concentrated in 14 workshops in the future. The principle of ensuring both reorganization and production is also valued. Many enterprises in Leningrad have guaranteed to complete the first half of the year's production plan one week ahead of schedule. According to the Leningrad State Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, after the reorganization, due to strengthening direct leadership and giving play to local initiative, the Leningrad Economic Zone will double its products during this five-year plan period under existing conditions.
　　In the Stalin Economic Zone of Donbass, the newly established National Economic Committee will replace many industrial ministries to manage more than 500 industrial enterprises and more than 200 construction units. In terms of the number of workers and technicians and the quantity of products, this is the first industrial zone in Ukraine. Nine sections and six bureaus have been established within the National Economic Committee. The Coal Mine Administration Bureau has already begun work. This economic zone pays great attention to the supply of industrial products, raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, equipment, and daily necessities. A bureau for material and technical supply has been established within the new institution, which controls warehouses and is also responsible for finding new sources of raw materials.
　　While reorganizing the management system of industry and construction, the Soviet government adopted the suggestions of scientists and decided to establish a new scientific center in the East. At the meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the 7th, Academic Secretary-General, Academician Topchiyev, announced this decision. The measures for establishing the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were discussed. Scientific research institutions in eastern Siberia, Yakutia, Sakhalin and other places will be unified under the leadership of this new scientific center. Many famous scientists will participate in the work of the organizing committee of this branch. A new science city will be built on the banks of the Ob River near Novosibirsk as the location of the branch. Many new research institutes will be built in the new science city, such as institutes of mathematics, mechanics, fluid mechanics, physics, automation, geology and geophysics, thermotics, experimental biology, medicine, cytology and genetics, economics and statistics, and so on. Many scientific research institutions and scientists from other cities will go there.
　　During this reorganization, many experts are being transferred from central industrial departments to local areas. Engineer Vasilyev of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry, engineer Kasiri of the Russian Federal Republic's Textile Industry Ministry, and others have decided to work for the National Economic Committees of various economic zones. They said that many experts from central departments are willing to go to the National Economic Committees.

　　苏联将建立一百零五个经济区
　　现正讨论编制挑选干部下月开始工作
　　科学院决定在东方建立新的领导中心
    本报莫斯科10日电  在不久前举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议闭幕以后，各加盟共和国最高苏维埃相继举行会议，确定了成立经济区和国民经济委员会的具体措施。俄罗斯联邦共和国已决定成立七十个经济区，乌克兰共和国成立十一个，哈萨克共和国九个，乌兹别克共和国四个，其他共和国各一个，共一百零五个。各个经济区都正在紧张地组织国民经济委员会，讨论编制，挑选干部，以便在7月1日能够开始工作。
    莫斯科（市）经济区国民经济委员会的机构和人选已经安排就绪，现在国民经济委员会的各个管理局准备从各个工业部接管企业。莫斯科经济区将管辖五百多个工厂，它们生产从机器到布匹等种类繁多的工业品。为了领导这些企业，在国民经济委员会内成立了二十个管理局。除了工厂，它们还领导科学研究所、实验室、设计组。新机构的特点在于把同类企业联合起来，加强生产的专业化。例如，莫斯科市有三十个制造仪器的工厂，以前由十一个工业部管理，现在将归一个仪器制造管理局管理，所以有可能更密切地分工合作。这是一方面。另一方面，在新机构内设立了专业化和协作局，以负责各个管理局的企业之间的联系，本经济区工业和别区工业之间的联系，以及发展本区工厂的专业化。
    列宁格勒经济区的国民经济委员会将于15日组成。包括二十多个局的机构已经确定，领导干部已经选好，只有编制还在最后审核中。新机构将是精干灵活的，它准备接管六百五十个工厂。人们预料：在改组后，列宁格勒工业的专业化情况将会彻底改善。例如，锻件、铸件等等可以集中生产，而现在它们是分散在八十个工厂生产的，因此生产能力不能充分发挥，产品成本也高。有一百二十五个企业的生产专业化问题正在被研究中。现在有一百个锻工车间，将来可以集中在十四个车间生产。改组与生产两不误的原则也受到了重视。列宁格勒的许多企业保证提前一周完成上半年生产计划。据苏共列宁格勒州委会估计：在改组后，由于加强直接的领导和发挥地方的积极性，列宁格勒经济区在现有条件下，在这个五年计划期间产品将增加一倍。
    在顿巴斯的斯大林经济区，新成立的国民经济委员会将代替许多工业部管理五百多个工业企业和二百多个建设单位。就工人和技术人员人数以及产品数量来说，这是乌克兰第一个工业区。在国民经济委员会内设立九个科和六个局。煤矿管理局已经开始工作。这个经济区对工业品、原料、材料、燃料、电力、设备和日用品的供应问题很注意。在新机构内设立了物资和技术供应局，它掌握仓库同时负责寻找原料的新来源。
    在改组工业和建设的管理制度的同时，苏联政府采纳了科学家的建议，决定在东方建立新的科学中心。在7日苏联科学院主席团会议上，学术秘书长托普切夫院士宣布了这个决定。随着讨论了建立苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院的措施。西伯利亚东部、雅库特、库页岛等地的科学研究机关将统一由这个新的科学中心领导。许多著名科学家将参加这个总分院的组织委员会工作。将在新西伯利亚市附近的鄂毕河岸上建设新的科学城，作为总分院的所在地。在新的科学城中将建设许多新的研究所，如数学、力学、流体力学、物理、自动学、地质学和地球物理学、热学、实验生物学、医学、细胞学和遗传学、经济学和统计学等等研究所。其他城市的许多科学研究机关和科学家将到那里去。
    在这个改组的时候，有许多专家从中央工业部门下放到地方去。苏联轻工业部的工程师瓦西列夫等，俄罗斯联邦共和国纺织工业部的工程师卡西里等，都决定到各经济区的国民经济委员会去工作。他们说：许多中央部门的专家都愿意下到国民经济委员会去。
