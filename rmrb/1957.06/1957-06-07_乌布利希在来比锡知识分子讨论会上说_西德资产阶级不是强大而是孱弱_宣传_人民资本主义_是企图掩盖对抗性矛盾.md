Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 4th: According to a Deutsches Depeschen Dienst (DDP) dispatch from Leipzig: At a discussion held on the evening of June 2nd in Leipzig with over a hundred intellectuals, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said that West Germany's propaganda about "People's Capitalism" demonstrates the feebleness of the West German bourgeoisie.

	He said: In West Germany, as a highly industrialized capitalist country, social contradictions have reached their peak due to automation and the application of atomic energy. The bourgeoisie has recognized this and is therefore promoting "People's Capitalism."

	Ulbricht pointed out: This is not a manifestation of the West German bourgeoisie's strength, but rather a sign of its weakness, because the purpose of doing so is to conceal from the workers the antagonistic contradiction between the social nature of production and capitalist private ownership. Overcoming this fundamental contradiction is a historical inevitability and will allow the people to fully develop all their talents.

	This discussion marked the beginning of a broad and open discussion in the German Democratic Republic on ideological understanding of socialist construction, particularly the future of the two Germanys and issues of socialist ethics and morality.

	Ulbricht answered various questions at the meeting. He emphasized that some important suggestions and criticisms were raised during the discussion. He said: This kind of discussion should continue because every issue is far from being thoroughly discussed. He said, "We are in favor of holding open discussions because doing so can help overcome some inevitable mistakes in socialist construction."

	When Ulbricht spoke about the question of Germany's future raised by Dr. Schleifstein, professor of philosophy at Karl Marx University, he said: The German people must draw lessons from their own history, especially from the two world wars. Here arise issues such as the overthrow of imperialism. These issues have become topics of discussion among people in West Germany today.

	Ulbricht pointed out: "We must succeed in isolating the atomic war-mongers. Whoever does not take a clear position is helping West German militarism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; there is no third way. We must lead the attack against West German militarism and reactionaries. To influence West Germany, we must correctly use our strength, we must win the trust of the people, so that a major change can occur in the balance of power in West Germany."

    乌布利希在来比锡知识分子讨论会上说
    西德资产阶级不是强大而是孱弱
    宣传“人民资本主义”是企图掩盖对抗性矛盾
    新华社柏林4日电　据德意志通讯社来比锡讯：德国统一社会党第一书记乌布利希2日晚上在来比锡同一百多位知识分子举行讨论会时说：西德关于“人民资本主义”的宣传表明了西德资产阶级的孱弱。
    他说：在作为高度工业化的资本主义国家的西德，由于自动化和应用原子能，社会矛盾已经达到了顶点。资产阶级已经认识到这一点，因此正在宣传“人民资本主义”。
    乌布利希指出：这并不是西德资产阶级强大的表现，而是孱弱的表现，因为这样做的目的是想对工人们隐瞒生产的社会性和资本主义私有制之间的对抗性矛盾。克服这个基本矛盾是历史的必然性，并且会使得人民充分发挥他们的一切才能。
    这次讨论会是民主德国关于社会主义建设的思想认识问题、特别是现在的两个德国的前途问题和社会主义伦理和道德问题的广泛和公开的讨论的开始。
    乌布利希在会上答复了各种问题。他着重指出，讨论中提出了一些重要的建议和批评。他说：这种讨论应当继续进行，因为每个问题都还远没有谈彻底。他说：“我们赞成举行公开讨论，因为这样做能够帮助克服社会主义建设中一些免不了要发生的错误。”
    乌布利希在谈到卡尔·马克思大学哲学系教授施莱夫施太因博士所提出的关于德国的前途问题时说：德国人民必须从自己的历史中、特别是从两次世界大战中汲取教训。这里产生了像推翻帝国主义等问题。这些问题今天已经成了西德人们讨论的话题。
    乌布利希指出：“我们必须在孤立原子战争贩子们方面获得成功。谁不采取明确的立场，谁就是帮助西德军国主义和北大西洋公约组织，第三条道路是没有的。必须领导对西德的军国主义和反动派的进攻。要影响西德，我们就必须正确地使用我们的力量，我们就必须争取人民的信任，以便使西德的力量对比发生重大的改变。”
