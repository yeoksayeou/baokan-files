Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th—Last night, a time bomb in Guangzhou Cultural Park that was only twenty minutes away from exploding was discovered by two young apprentices who were visiting the park. They caught the special agent, Long Peiqiang, who had just thrown the time bomb. Public security personnel who arrived at the scene immediately detained the special agent and took emergency safety measures for the time bomb.

Cultural Park is Guangzhou's most popular public entertainment venue. Special agent Long Peiqiang, under the orders of the Chiang Kai-shek group's special agent agency stationed in Hong Kong, chose this place as the target for the explosion.

At 9:50 last night, as a large number of park visitors were leaving the park along the avenue next to the flower garden to return home, the special agent Long Peiqiang, disguised as a tourist, took advantage of the opportunity to take out a black cloth bag from his pocket and secretly threw it into the flower garden of the aquarium. This suspicious situation immediately aroused the vigilance of the young apprentices Tan Qinghua and Li Shengchang, who were talking near the flower garden. Tan Qinghua, who quickly went to check the black cloth bag, saw that the bag contained a bomb and immediately shouted. At this time, Li Shengchang, who was behind the special agent Long Peiqiang, grabbed the "owner of the black cloth bag".

The two young apprentices later told reporters: This guy's suspicious behavior had already caught our attention. When we were chatting, we found a sneaky person constantly pacing uneasily near the flower garden, so we decided to keep an eye on him. Who knew he threw down a bomb, so we quickly caught him.

When reporters arrived at the scene at 10:30, they saw angry crowds still surrounding and cursing the twenty-three-year-old special agent, whose head was lowered and face was pale. In front of the special agent were the seized evidence of the crime: a US-made time bomb numbered ○○○一○五 and more than two hundred reactionary leaflets.

Special agent Long Peiqiang confessed to public security personnel after being arrested last night: In February this year, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek group's special agent organization in Hong Kong and received demolition training. On May 9th, under the orders of the Chiang Kai-shek group's special agent agency stationed in Hong Kong, he once went to Guangzhou to attempt to blow up Guangzhou Cultural Park. He said that the special agent agency ordered him to put the bomb in the most crowded place in Cultural Park. But after he arrived in Guangzhou that time, he returned to Hong Kong because he did not get the bomb. He came to Guangzhou this time on June 2nd. But he was caught when he got the time bomb and was about to commit the crime in Cultural Park. (Attached picture)

    两个机警勇敢的青年学徒在广州文化公园
    当场捉住放定时炸弹的特务
    新华社广州8日电　昨天晚上，广州文化公园内只差二十分钟便要爆炸的一颗定时炸弹，给正在那里游园的两个青年学徒发现了。他们当场捉住了把定时炸弹扔下不久的特务分子龙沛强。赶到现场的公安人员随即把这个特务分子扣押起来，并且对定时炸弹采取了紧急的安全措施。
    文化公园是广州最热闹的群众娱乐场所。特务分子龙沛强奉蒋介石集团驻香港特务机关的命令，选择这个地方作为爆炸的目标。
    昨晚九时五十分，当大批游园群众正在沿着花圃旁边的大道离园返家的时候，扮作游客的特务分子龙沛强趁机从裤袋内掏出一个黑布袋，把它偷偷地扔到园内水产馆的花圃里。这个可疑的情况立刻引起了在花圃附近谈心的青年学徒谭青华、李盛昌的警惕。迅速前去检查黑布袋的谭青华看到布袋里装的是炸弹，立即叫了起来，这时跟在特务分子龙沛强背后的李盛昌便随手抓住了这个“黑布袋的主人”。
    这两个青年学徒事后对记者说：这个家伙的可疑行动早已引起我们的注意。当我们正在聊天的时候，发现了一个鬼鬼祟祟的人老是在花圃附近不安地打转，因此我们决定盯住他。谁知他扔下来的却是炸弹，因此他很快就被我们捉住了。
    当记者在十时三十分赶到现场的时候，看到愤怒的群众还在围住这个二十三岁的、头部低垂、脸色惨白的特务分子咒骂。在特务分子的跟前摆出了当场被搜获出来的罪证：○○○一○五号的美制定时炸弹和二百多张反动传单。
    特务分子龙沛强昨晚被捕后向公安人员供认：今年2月，他在香港参加了蒋介石集团的特务组织，接受了爆破训练。5月9日，他奉蒋介石集团驻香港特务机关的命令，曾一度到过广州，企图爆炸广州文化公园。他说，当时特务机关命令他把炸弹放到文化公园内人群最多的地方。但是那次他到了广州以后，因为没有拿到炸弹，便回香港去了。他这次来到广州是在6月2日。但是当他拿到了定时炸弹正在文化公园行凶的时候，就被捉住了。（附图片）
