　　Healing the War Wounds of Recovered Territories
　　Large-Scale Construction Begins in Western Poland

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th: Following the new policy of restoring old factories and houses as much as possible, large-scale economic construction has further begun in Poland's western recovered territories (referring to the territories recovered from Germany after World War II). In Wrocław Province (i.e., Lower Silesia) alone, 160 factories destroyed in the war will be restored this year, which will be able to accommodate thousands of workers.

　　In the past, this area only focused on building new factories and houses, and paid little attention to the original factories that could be rebuilt or repaired without a large investment. Therefore, some houses that would have been very good with a little repair collapsed due to disrepair over the years.

　　According to the planning agency of Wrocław Province, by 1960, the province will be able to accommodate 100,000 industrial and agricultural laborers. Among the 160 factories restored this year, one is a leather factory rebuilt on the basis of a former German tank factory, which can produce 7,000 tons of leather annually and accommodate 3,000 employees.

　　While restoring old factories, many new enterprises are also starting to be built in the western region. These new enterprises include copper mines and open-pit lignite coal mines built with loans from the German Democratic Republic.

　　In order to build the western region, more than 2,000 households have been relocated here from the central provinces since the beginning of this year.

### 医治收复地区战争创伤  波兰西部开始大规模建设

　　医治收复地区战争创伤
　　波兰西部开始大规模建设
    据新华社华沙11日电  根据尽可能修复旧有工厂和房屋的新方针，波兰西部收复区（指第二次世界大战后从德国收复的地区）进一步开始了大规模的经济建设工作。单在弗罗茨瓦夫省（即下西里西亚）今年就将修复一百六十个在战争中毁坏了的工厂，这些工厂将能够容纳数千名工人。
    过去，这个地区只注意建设新的工厂和房屋，而对于那些不需要大量投资便可以改建或修复的原有工厂却不大注意。因此，有些本来稍加修理就是很好的房屋却因年久失修而倒坍了。
    据弗罗茨瓦夫省的计划机关宣布，到1960年这个省就能够接纳十万名工农业劳动者。在今年修复的一百六十个工厂中，有一个是在前德国坦克工厂的基础上改建起来的皮革工厂，这个工厂能够年产七千吨皮革，并且能够容纳三千名职工。
    在修复旧工厂的同时，许多新的企业也在西部地区开始兴建。这些新企业包括铜矿和用民主德国贷款兴建的露天褐煤煤矿等。
    为了建设西部地区，今年以来已经有两千多户居民从中央各省迁移到这里来了。
