Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: At a symposium for non-Party members of the State Council convened by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, Yang Yuqing, a State Council Counselor, once again explained and clarified his remarks about "getting off the sedan chair" and "stepping down from the stage" that he made at a symposium for legal scholars.

　　At the May 31st symposium, Yang Yuqing called this rectification movement a "getting off the sedan chair" movement, saying that senior cadres in Beijing should "get off the sedan chair" and some should even "step down from the stage." At the June 8th symposium for non-Party members of the State Council, Yang Yuqing said that his "getting off the sedan chair" was equivalent to the past "going downstairs" or "taking a bath," and "stepping down from the stage" only meant that some individuals should change jobs. Today, Yang Yuqing reiterated that his speech at the legal scholars' symposium was somewhat "misunderstood." Regarding "getting off the sedan chair," it only meant that Communist Party members who were detached from the masses should go among the masses, and "stepping down from the stage" only meant that from an administrative perspective, he hoped some individuals could change jobs.

　　Yang Yuqing said that some leading comrades told him that he was an old friend of the Communist Party and should offer more opinions to the Party during the rectification, which is why he presented his opinions to the Party. He also said that in this rectification, he wanted to be like Zhang Yilin of the old Political Consultative Conference era, to "break the Party's horns and criticize the Party's scales." His speech was merely sharp in language and did not consider the consequences.

　　Yang Yuqing said that he did not fundamentally oppose singing praises of merit and virtue, but only said that making it a style of writing was not very good. He believed that some great principles could be spoken of in the past, can be spoken of today, and can still be spoken of tomorrow, but it is necessary to grasp the needs of this time and this place. Now, newspapers are publishing lengthy articles on such great principles, which is not very suitable for today's rectification.

　　Yang Yuqing also used the story of Zou Ji advising King Wei of Qi as an analogy, saying that he hoped the Communist Party could listen to different opinions, even harsh ones.

　　Li Zuyin, a State Council Counselor, criticized Yang Yuqing's speech today. He believed that Yang Yuqing's explanation of "getting off the sedan chair" as Communist Party members going among the masses and "stepping down from the stage" as some individuals changing jobs was sophistry and did not match his original intention.

　　Li Zuyin said that Yang Yuqing said he liked to use ancient idioms, such as "curing the disease to save the patient, learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones," which were appropriate to use in the present. However, Yang Yuqing's citation of the story of Zou Ji advising King Qi, using Zou Ji's wife who was partial to him, concubine who feared him, and retainers who sought his favor, to compare them to the broad masses of people who support the Communist Party, was an inappropriate analogy and very inappropriate.

　　Li Zuyin believed that Yang Yuqing's speech at the legal scholars' symposium was not an attitude of offering opinions to the Party. He said that listening to his words and observing his actions, Yang Yuqing was hostile to the Party and hostile to reality. He could not see today's thriving construction undertakings, or he deliberately pretended not to see them, which is why he proposed the saying "getting off the sedan chair" and "stepping down from the stage." Li Zuyin believed that in the Kuomintang era, it was necessary to oppose the status quo, which also truthfully reflected reality, but today's status quo is mostly good, and the saying of opposing the status quo does not conform to today's reality.

　　Wang Genzhong, a State Council Counselor, criticized Yang Yuqing for using the story of Zou Ji advising King Qi to actually uglify the people who support the Party, uglifying them as Zou Ji's "wife, concubine, and retainers." Wang Genzhong said that words are the voice of the heart, and Yang Yuqing's emotions towards the Party's leadership are confrontational.

　　Chen Guangyao, a researcher at the Chinese Language Reform Committee, refuted Yang Yuqing's saying of "breaking horns and criticizing scales" in a written statement. Chen Guangyao said that in the old Political Consultative Conference era, Mr. Zhang Yilin used the four characters "breaking horns and criticizing scales" to oppose the Jiang regime, which was supported by facts and was correct. But Yang Yuqing's use of this phrase today to describe his impression of the people's regime is a serious error in his thinking. Because the bad behavior of individual Party members cannot represent the entire Communist Party, and the Party is not a stubborn evil dragon, Yang Yuqing's metaphor of "breaking horns and criticizing scales" is inappropriate.

　　Yu Xin’gu, from the State Council Legislative Bureau, criticized Yang Yuqing’s saying that today’s newspapers should not publish lengthy articles on great principles, saying that these great principles must be spoken of today because some people are exploiting the Party’s rectification to carry out malicious propaganda. Workers and peasants are closely linked to the Communist Party by blood and flesh, so they come out to speak. It is only permissible for some people to say "get off the sedan chair" and "step down from the stage," but not permissible for workers and peasants to speak of great principles. Is this fair? I think it is very unfair.

　　Yu Xin’gu also said, the Communist Party treats Yang Yuqing as an old friend, but does Yang Yuqing treat the Communist Party as an old friend? Yang Yuqing proposed "getting off the sedan chair" and said that those who support the Party carried the sedan chair and are unwilling to let go of the carrying pole. Is this what an old friend of the Communist Party would say?

　　Yu Xin'gu believes that open reactionary remarks should be refuted, and words that support and encourage reactionary remarks in a hidden way should also be exposed.

　　Luo Jiezi, a State Council Counselor, suggested that well-intentioned criticism should be treated correctly. A distinction should be made between well-intentioned criticisms that are incomplete or flawed, and the anti-socialist remarks of right-wing elements. Anti-socialist reactionary remarks should be seriously refuted. Relevant democratic parties and people's organizations should try to educate and help those who express incorrect opinions, and even carry out ideological struggle with them. High vigilance should be maintained against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, attention should be paid to the "three evils," and attention should also be paid to the enemy. While suppressing unhealthy trends and evil influences, the policy of great airing and great contending should continue to be implemented.

　　Ning Jiafeng and Chen Mingyi from the People's Bank of China also spoke at the meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: At a symposium for non-Party members convened by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, Huang Yuanbin, who works at the People's Bank of China, criticized Chen Xingui's speech at the Central Small Group meeting of the China Democratic League last night. Huang Yuanbin believed that Chen Xingui's saying that "if they were counter-revolutionaries, they would never speak of opinions that the newspapers consider wrong, they would certainly speak of how great the achievements of the Communist Party are" is actually an intentional slander of those who praise the greatness of the Communist Party.

　　Huang Yuanbin said that Chen Xingui's saying that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism is completely wrong. In fact, these three isms were brought about by the old society. Since these three isms were brought about by the old society, to eliminate these three isms, just like carrying out ideological remolding, cannot be done well in a day.

### 国务院的党外人士同杨玉清展开激烈论战

　　国务院的党外人士同杨玉清展开激烈论战
    新华社12日讯  在国务院秘书长习仲勋召开的国务院非党人士座谈会上，国务院参事杨玉清对他在法学界人士座谈会上所说的“下轿”、“下台”再一次作了解释和说明。
    在5月31日举行的那次座谈会上，杨玉清把这次整风运动叫作“下轿”运动，他说在北京的上级干部要“下轿”，有的还要“下台”。杨玉清在8日举行的国务院非党人士座谈会上，他说他所讲的“下轿”等于过去的“下楼”、“洗澡”，“下台”只是要个别人换换工作。杨玉清今天再次声明他在法学界座谈会上的发言有些“被误解”，关于“下轿”只是要脱离群众的共产党员到群众中去，“下台”只是从行政的角度希望个别的人换换工作。
    杨玉清说有的领导同志说他是共产党的老朋友，要在整风中向党多提意见，所以才向党提出自己的意见。他还说，在这次整风中他要做旧政协时代的张一麟，要“折党之角，批党之鳞”。他的发言只是用语尖锐，不考虑后果。
    杨玉清说他并没有从根本上反对歌功颂德，只是说把歌功颂德造成一种文风是不很好的。他认为有些大道理过去可以讲，今天可以讲，明天仍然可以讲，一定要抓住此时、此地的需要，现在报纸上连篇累牍地登载了这一类讲大道理的文章，对今天的整风是不大适宜的。
    杨玉清还以邹忌谏齐威王的故事来作譬喻，说是希望共产党能听不同的意见，甚至是刺耳的意见。
    国务院参事李祖荫批评了杨玉清今天的发言。他认为，杨玉清把自己提出的“下轿”解释成要共产党员到群众中去，“下台”解释成要个别人换换工作是强词夺理，与他自己的本意不符。
    李祖荫说，杨玉清说自己好用古语，如“治病救人、惩前毖后”等古语今用，就恰到好处，但杨玉清引用邹忌谏齐威王的故事，把齐臣邹忌的有所私的妻、有所畏的妾、有所求的门客，来比喻拥护共产党的广大人民群众，是拟于不伦，很不适当。
    李祖荫认为杨玉清在法学界座谈会上的发言不是对党提意见的态度。他说听其言而观其行，杨玉清对于党是仇视的，对于现实是仇视的，看不见今天蓬勃发展的建设事业，或者是虽看见而故作不知，所以提出“下轿”、“下台”的说法。李祖荫认为在国民党时代是要反现状的，这样也是如实地反映了现实，但今天的现状大多数是好的，反现状的说法是不符合今天的现实的。
    国务院参事王艮仲批评杨玉清引用邹忌谏齐王的故事实际上是丑化拥护党的人，丑化他们是邹忌的“妻、妾、门客”之类。王艮仲说，言为心声，杨玉清在感情上对党的领导是对抗的。
    中国文字改革委员会研究员陈光尧在书面发言中，批驳了杨玉清所说的“折角批鳞”。陈光尧说，在旧政协时代，张一麟先生以“折角批鳞”四字反对蒋政权，那是有事实为证的，也是对的。但杨玉清今天竟然用这句话来形容他对人民政权的印象，这在他思想上就是一个严重的错误。因为个别党员的某些不良作风不能代表整个的共产党，而党也不是恶龙那样冥顽不灵，所以杨玉清所用的“折角批鳞”这个比喻是不恰当的。
    国务院法制局的余鑫菇批评了杨玉清所说的今天的报纸不应该连篇累牍地登载讲大道理的文章的说法，他说，这些大道理今天必须讲，因为有些人钻党整风的空子，进行恶意宣传，工人农民与共产党血肉相关，才出来讲话，只许有人说“下轿”、“下台”，不许工人农民讲大道理，这样公平不公平呢？我看是太不公平了。
    余鑫菇还说，共产党把杨玉清当作老朋友，但杨玉清是否把共产党当作老朋友呢？杨玉清提出“下轿”，并且说拥护党的人抬了轿子还不愿放轿杆，这样是不是共产党的老朋友在讲话呢？
    余鑫菇认为现在对一些公开的反动言论予以驳斥，对一些用隐蔽方式支持和鼓励反动言论的话，也应该加以揭露。
    国务院参事骆介子建议，要正确地对待善意的批评，对待一些不全面的、有缺点的善意批评与右派分子的反社会主义言论，要分清界限；严肃驳斥反社会主义的反动言论，对于发表不正确意见的人，有关的民主党派和人民团体要尽量对他们进行教育帮助，甚至开展思想斗争；高度警惕反革命分子的破坏活动，注意“三害”，也要注意敌人，在把歪风邪气打下去的同时，继续贯彻大放大鸣的方针。
    在会上发言的还有中国人民银行的宁嘉风、陈鸣一。
    据新华社11日讯  在国务院秘书长习仲勋今天召开的非党人士座谈会上，在中国人民银行工作的黄元彬批评了陈新桂昨晚在中国民主同盟中央小组会上的发言。黄元彬认为陈新桂所说的“要是反革命分子，绝不讲报纸上认为错误的言论，他一定会讲共产党的成绩如何伟大之类”的这种说法，实际上是有意诬蔑歌颂共产党伟大的人。
    黄元彬说，陈新桂所说的无产阶级专政是产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源，是完全错误的，事实上，这三个主义都是旧社会带来的。既然这三个主义是旧社会带来的，因此要消灭这三个主义，正如进行思想改造一样，不是一天之内就能改好的。
