　　Before and After Rectification
　　By our reporter Liu Bang
    A few months ago, I went to the Ziyou Road Store of the Lanzhou Department Store to buy a pair of shoelaces. I didn't expect to buy a bellyful of absurdities. For a commodity worth only four cents, the salesperson routinely handed me three exquisitely printed invoices (to be precise, one invoice and two stubs), asking me to line up at the cashier's counter to pay, wait for the cashier to stamp them with official and private seals, and then bring them back to exchange for the goods.

    A few days ago, I went to this store to buy something again. When the salesperson finished wrapping the goods I had selected, according to past "experience," I reached out to ask her for the payment invoice. Unexpectedly, this time she reached out to me for the money: "Comrade! We have changed; now it's one hand receiving payment, one hand delivering goods, for the convenience of customers!"

    Before Rectification: It took 20 days for a commodity to be transferred from the freight station to the store.
    With a slight glance, it's not difficult to guess that the store's "change" is not limited to the payment and delivery system. Obviously, the variety of goods has increased: many long-out-of-stock items have reappeared, and the windows and counters are filled with dazzling goods, like a spring garden. Purchasing personnel often run over to discuss customers' "appetites" with the salespeople; the salespeople are also quicker and more amiable than before. ... Of course, these are just some phenomena that customers can directly feel. If you listen to what their manager says, you will be even more surprised. This store has added 576 new kinds of goods in twenty-four days; the store's employees have been reduced from the original 371 to 312; it used to take about twenty days for a commodity to be transferred from the freight station to the store, now it only takes ten days at most. ...

    Why can fewer people do more and better work? It turns out that the Lanzhou commercial system recently conducted a comprehensive rectification regarding the improvement of business management. The changes in the Ziyou Road Store are one of the new atmospheres that have emerged after the rectification.

    With the rapid increase of the urban population, Lanzhou's commercial work has developed greatly last year. However, due to an insufficient understanding and implementation of the policy of running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and better serving consumers, problems such as over-rigid division of labor, bloated organizations, too many management personnel, complicated commodity circulation links, and excessive commodity circulation costs have also arisen. Taking the department store industry as an example: Lanzhou City established the Municipal Knitwear Company last year. The knitwear sold by the department store is all purchased by the Knitwear Company. Although the Municipal Department Store has established purchasing agencies in various places, the Municipal Knitwear Company also has to set up its own set. However, the Knitwear Company does not have a store; all the goods they purchase are wholesaled to the department store for retail. As a result, a piece of goods has to go through eleven procedures from the Knitwear Company to the Ziyou Road Department Store for sale. Since the Knitwear Company's business personnel are only responsible for purchasing and do not fully understand the customers' requirements, the phenomenon of blind purchasing resulting in stockpiling or out-of-stock items is not uncommon. The single clothes purchased by this company this spring were stockpiled for more than 84,000 sets.

    The phenomena of over-rigid division of labor, too many links, complicated procedures, waste of manpower, and disconnection between purchase and sales also existed within the department store. The company has three departments: business, storage and transportation, and wholesale. Regardless of the type of goods, they are first sent to the warehouse of the Storage and Transportation Department, then allocated by the Business Department, then to the warehouse of the Wholesale Department, and finally to the store. It has to go through four major passes such as entry, allocation, entry, and sales. Recently, phonographs cannot be bought on the market in Lanzhou, but a batch of phonographs are lying in the warehouse of the Department Store's Storage and Transportation Department. This batch of goods was shipped from Shanghai on March 26, but it still couldn't complete these "formalities" by April 26.

    Barriers upon barriers, and the people guarding the barriers are busy. What are they busy with? In order to master the receipt, payment, and storage of the company's goods, the Storage and Transportation Department has a three-level commodity account and a custody account; the Business Department also has to set up a commodity quantity registration account to master the inventory for allocation; the Wholesale Department and the retail store also have their own three-level accounts; the custodians and the salespeople also each have their own set of commodity custody accounts. This company has seven or eight sets of similar account books, naturally requiring seven or eight sets of staff.

    The result of the above situation is: commodity circulation costs cannot be reduced, and the price difference between purchase and sale cannot be narrowed; the vast consumers are dissatisfied; and it promotes the bureaucracy of the leading staff of commercial institutions.

    After Rectification: The workload of commercial personnel increased by an average of about 50%.
    In response to this situation, in early March, the Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Commerce led the city's commercial institutions to conduct a rectification from point to surface. Using the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily to conduct in-depth inspection of work, and through the method of combining bottom-up and top-down, carefully calculate five accounts (annual sales plan, staffing and the annual workload per person, the number of times the funds are turned over, the level of expenses, and the profits turned over), merged institutions, reduced levels, streamlined personnel, enriched the grassroots, thereby greatly improving the city's commercial management level. Still taking the department store industry as an example: they merged the Knitwear Company into the Department Store; abolished the original three departments of business, storage and transportation, and wholesale within the Department Store, and unifiedly established a wholesale general store; improved the sales division into a combination of purchasing and sales, the wholesale general store directly handles transactions with various stores, canceling the past allocation system; and each retail store became an independent accounting unit. Now, the purchase and sales procedures have been simplified from the past dozen steps to three steps, and the time for transferring goods from the station to the store has also been greatly shortened, and the commodity accounts have been reduced from the past seven or eight sets to two or three sets. The number of employees in the Municipal Department Store (including the Knitwear Company) has been streamlined from the original 1,634 to 1,071. After the rectification, the average annual workload per person in the wholesale department increased by 55.2% compared with before, and the average annual workload per person in the retail store increased by 42.29%. The number of days of capital turnover has accelerated by eight days compared with before the rectification, the level of expenses has decreased by 0.81% compared with the original plan, and the profit rate is estimated to be 1.18% higher than last year. The streamlined personnel will be arranged in newly established commercial institutions.

    Currently, the number of people engaged in commercial and service industries in Lanzhou City accounts for only 3.05% of the city's total population. After this rectification and improved management level, according to preliminary estimates, as long as the number of people engaged in commercial and service industries reaches 3.5% of the city's total population, it can basically meet the needs. Referring to the proportion of urban population growth, the original plan was for Lanzhou to increase the number of employees in commercial and service industries by more than 10,000 this year, but now it is enough to add only more than 2,000, which will save the country a considerable amount of expenses.

　　整顿前后
　　本报记者　柳梆
    前几个月，我到兰州市百货公司自由路商店买一双鞋带，想不到竟买来了满肚子的啼笑皆非。一共只值四分钱的商品，营业员照例递给我三张印刷颇为精致的发票（确切地说，一张发票，两张存根），要我到收款柜台依序排队交款，听候收款员在上面加盖公私图章，然后再拿回来换取货物。
    前几天，我又到这个商店买东西。当营业员把我挑选的商品包扎完毕以后，根据以往的“经验”，我伸手向她要交款的发票，出乎意料之外，这回她却伸手向我要钱：“同志！我们变了；现在是一手收款，一手交货，便利顾客嘛！”
    整顿前：一件商品从货站转运到门市部需要二十天
    稍为浏览一下，不难揣测出这个商店“变了”的不仅限于收款、付货制度。显然，商品的花样品种增加了：不少长期脱销的货物又出现了，橱窗里和柜台上陈列得琳琅满目，像春天的花园一样，采购人员不时跑来同营业员研究顾客的“胃口”；营业员也比较从前手脚勤快，态度和蔼了。……当然，这只是顾客直接所能感觉到的一些现象。如果再听听他们经理说的话，就会更感惊讶。这个商店在二十四天中新添了五百七十六种商品；商店的职工从原来的三百七十一人减为三百一十二人；从前一件商品从货站转运到门市部一般都要二十天，现在顶多只要十天。……
    为什么人员减少了，反而能够多办事，办好事？原来，兰州市的商业系统最近普遍地进行了一次关于改善经营管理的整顿工作。自由路商店的变化，就是整顿后出现的新气象之一。
    随着城市人口的激增，兰州市的商业工作去年有了很大的发展。但是由于对勤俭办企业、更好地为消费者服务的方针认识不深，贯彻执行不够，所以也产生了分工过死，机构臃肿，管理人员过多，商品流转环节繁复，商品流转费用过高等毛病。以百货业为例：兰州市去年成立了市针织品公司，百货公司销售的针织品，全部由针织品公司进货。市百货公司在各地虽然已经设有采购机构，市针织品公司也得另搞一套。但是针织品公司没有门市部，他们采购进来的货物全部批发给百货公司零售。于是，一件货物从针织品公司提到自由路百货商店销售，要经过十一道手续。既然针织品公司的业务人员只管采购，并不完全了解顾客的要求，因此，盲目进货造成商品积压或脱销的现象就屡见不鲜了。今年春季这个公司购进的单衣服就积压了八万四千多套。
    分工过死，环节过多，手续复杂，浪费人力，进销脱节的现象，在百货公司内部也同样存在。这个公司设有业务、储运、批发三大部门。不管何种商品，首先送进储运科仓库，经业务科调拨，再进批发部仓库，最后才到门市部。前后要经过进账、调拨、进账、销售等四大关口。近来，兰州市面上买不到留声机，可是却有一批留声机躺在百货公司储运科的仓库里。这批商品是3月26日从上海运来的，到4月26日还走不完这些“过场”。
    关卡重重叠叠，把关的人忙忙碌碌。他们到底忙些什么呢？储运科为了掌握公司商品的收、付、存的情况，设有商品三级账和保管账；业务科同样要设商品数量登记账以掌握库存，以便调拨分配；批发部和零售门市部也要有自己的三级账；保管员和营业员彼此也各搞一套商品保管账。这个公司就有七、八套类似的账簿，自然必须有七、八套工作人员。
    上述局面发展的结果是：商品流转费用降不下来，购销差价幅度无法缩小；广大的消费者不满意；助长了商业机构领导工作人员的官僚主义。
    整顿后：商业人员工作量平均提高50％左右
    针对这种情况，3月初，中共兰州市委财贸部和市商业局由点到面地领导全市商业机构进行一次整顿。用勤俭办企业的精神深入检查工作，通过自下而上和自上而下相结合的办法细算五笔账（全年的销售计划，人员编制及每人每年的工作量，资金周转的次数，费用水平，上缴利润），合并了机构，减少了层次，精简了人员，充实了基层，从而大大地提高了全市商业的经营管理水平。仍然以百货业为例：他们把针织品公司合并归百货公司；撤消了原百货公司内部的业务、储运、批发三个部门，统一成立一个批发总店；改进销分工为进销合一，批发总店直接向各门市部办理交易手续，取消过去的调拨制度；各零售门市部成为独立的核算单位。现在，进销手续由过去的十几道简化为三道，货物从到站转运到门市部的时间也大大缩减，商品账由过去的七、八套减少为二、三套。市百货公司职工人数（包括针织品公司）从原来的一千六百三十四人精简为一千零七十一人。整顿之后，批发部门工作人员平均每人全年的工作量比以前提高55.2％，零售门市部平均每人全年提高42.29％。资金周转天数比整顿前加速八天，费用水平比原计划降低0.81％，利润率估计可以比上年提高1.18％。精简下来的这批人员，将安排到新增设的商业机构中。
    目前，兰州市的商业和服务性行业的从业人员只占全市总人口的3.05％。经过这次整顿，提高了经营管理水平以后，据初步估计，商业和服务性行业的从业人员只要达到全市人口总数的3.5％，就基本上可以满足需要。参照城市人口增长的比例，原计划兰州市今年要增加商业和服务性行业的职工一万多人，现在只要再添二千多人就足够了，这将会给国家节约一笔相当可观的费用。
