　　According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th: Syrian Acting Defense Minister Khaled al-Azem said that Syria does not intend to give Jordan financial aid. Azem's remarks were published in the "Al-Jamahir" newspaper on June 15th. He said: "The Saudi Arabian-Jordanian joint communiqué issued on June 13th is merely a deceptive trick to get Jordan this aid."

　　Azem said that the real ruler of Jordan today is not Prime Minister Hashim, but Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Samir al-Rifai, who is a disguised Glubb and an open enemy of the national liberation cause.

　　He said that Rifai had put the parliament on vacation, attempting to dissolve it, and arrested a large number of political figures, "overturned" the Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army, and placed "Glubb's agents" in important positions.

　　Azem also said that Rifai had also asked Syria to withdraw its troops stationed in Jordan and allow Saudi Arabian troops to replace them. Rifai and his government also committed the shameful act of plotting to frame and expel the Egyptian military attaché in Amman.

　　He said that Rifai and his government cannot deceive Syria with the joint communiqué. He pointed out that Iraqi King Faisal had sent a telegram expressing support for the two Kings, Hussein and Saud, and that Iraq is a member of the Baghdad Pact, "would it be a supporter of a policy of active neutrality and an opponent of the treaty? Isn't this clear evidence that Saudi Arabia and Jordan have reached some kind of agreement that is not mentioned in the communiqué?"

　　On the other hand, according to an Associated Press report, Iraq will provide Jordan with the financial subsidies that Syria originally planned to give Jordan under the Arab Solidarity Agreement. The Associated Press said that Iraq's financial assistance to Jordan was agreed upon as early as when Saudi Arabian King Saud visited Iraq.

　　According to Amman news: Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai announced on the evening of June 16 that the Jordanian government has decided to close its embassy in Egypt and withdraw all embassy personnel.

　　Rifai said that this action was merely an "administrative diplomatic step" to protest Egypt's recent expulsion of the Jordanian ambassador. He said, "This does not mean severing diplomatic relations between the two countries." He also said that he has been authorized to retain the necessary Jordanian personnel in Cairo "to facilitate the execution of consular functions."

　　The Middle East News Agency, in commenting on the provocative behavior against the Egyptian military attaché in Jordan, emphasized that this incident occurred when Saudi Arabian King Saud was visiting Amman, and the purpose of this conspiracy was to make the Saudi King believe that Egypt deliberately intended to create chaos in Jordan during Saud's visit.

　　The Middle East News Agency said that the conspirators wanted to use this to instigate the Saudi King against Egypt, and gain Saudi support and favor for the Jordanian government, that is, to make the Saudi King believe that Egypt was conspiring against him, thereby causing a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

### 叙利亚将不给约旦财政援助　认为沙约联合公报是欺骗手段　约旦关闭驻埃大使馆并召回全体人员

　　叙利亚将不给约旦财政援助
　　认为沙约联合公报是欺骗手段
　　约旦关闭驻埃大使馆并召回全体人员
    本报综合报道　据新华社17日讯：叙利亚代理国防部长哈勒德·阿泽姆说，叙利亚不打算给约旦财政援助了。阿泽姆的谈话发表在6月15日的“群众报”上。他说：“6月13日发表的沙特阿拉伯—约旦会谈联合公报只是想使约旦得到这笔援助的一种欺骗手段。”
    阿泽姆说，今天约旦的真正统治者并不是哈希姆首相，而是副首相兼外交大臣萨米尔·里法伊，他是个伪装的格拉布，是民族解放事业的一个公开的敌人。
    他说，里法伊曾经让议会休假，企图把它解散，并且逮捕了大批政治人物，“搞翻了”约旦陆军参谋长，在重要职位上安置了“格拉布的代理人”。
    阿泽姆还说，里法伊还曾经要求叙利亚撤出驻约旦的军队，并且让沙特阿拉伯的军队代替了它们。里法伊和它的政府还作出了阴谋陷害并且驱逐埃及驻安曼武官这种可耻的行为。
    他说，里法伊和它的政府拿联合公报是欺骗不了叙利亚的。他指出，伊拉克国王费萨尔曾经发电报表示支持侯赛因和沙特两位国王，伊拉克是巴格达条约的成员国，“它会是积极中立政策的支持者和条约的反对者吗？难道这不是沙特阿拉伯、约旦两国达成了某种协议而不在公报中提及的明证吗？”
    另一方面，据美联社报道，伊拉克将向约旦提供叙利亚本来准备根据阿拉伯团结协定给予约旦的财政津贴。美联社说，伊拉克给约旦财政援助是早在沙特阿拉伯国王沙特访问伊拉克时就商量好了的。
    另据安曼消息：约旦外交大臣里法伊6月16日晚上宣布，约旦政府已经决定关闭它的驻埃及大使馆，并且撤回大使馆全体人员。
    里法伊说，这个行动只是对埃及最近驱逐约旦大使的行动表示抗议的一个“行政性的外交步骤”。他说，“这并不意味着断绝两国的外交关系”。他还说，他已经受权在开罗保留必要的约旦人员“以便利领事职权的执行”。
    中东通讯社在评论埃及驻约旦武官遭到的挑衅行为时着重指出，这件事发生在沙特阿拉伯国王沙特正在安曼进行访问的时候，这个阴谋的目的是打算使沙特国王相信，埃及蓄意要在沙特访问约旦期间在约旦制造混乱。
    中东通讯社说，阴谋家们想借此挑唆沙特国王反对埃及，取得沙特对约旦政府的支持和好感，也就是说，使沙特国王相信，埃及阴谋反对他，从而引起沙特阿拉伯和埃及之间的纠纷。
