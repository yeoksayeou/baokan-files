　　China's Airspace is Sacred and Inviolable
　　Our Army in Shantou Shoots Down and Damages an Intruder US Aircraft
    Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, 12th. The People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units stationed in the Shantou area shot down and damaged three US-Chiang aircraft on the afternoon of the 12th.
    At approximately 7 a.m. on the 12th, the American aircraft carrier USS Hornet and four destroyers set sail from Hong Kong to harass our South China Sea waters. At approximately 12 p.m., the enemy warships sailed to the waters between Hong Kong and Shantou. At 13:01, four American AB-type naval attack aircraft took off from the USS Hornet at 22 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees 03 minutes east longitude, south of Shantou, and intruded into the airspace over the Shantou area of Guangdong Province for harassment. They were immediately subjected to fierce artillery fire from our local garrison anti-aircraft artillery units, which damaged one of them. It trailed thick smoke as it fled southward. From 12:33 to 20:30, US military aircraft took off from the USS Hornet a total of 23 batches, 66 sorties.
    At 12:21, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes intruded into the airspace over the Shantou area to harass. Our anti-aircraft artillery units bombarded them fiercely, shooting down two of them, which crashed into the sea south of Dahao Island. The remaining two fled in a panic.
