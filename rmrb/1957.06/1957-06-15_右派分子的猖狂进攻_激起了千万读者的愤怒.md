The rampant attacks of the Rightists
　　Aroused the Anger of Millions of Readers

After newspapers across the country published the anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist speeches of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, Zhang Naiqi, and Yang Yuqing, workers, farmers, students, teachers, and citizens across the country sent letters to this newspaper, denouncing these speeches. From the 10th to the 14th, in five days, this newspaper received 3,566 letters, some written by individuals, others signed by several people or collectively.

　　Writing While Watching Children, Asking Others to Write What They Couldn't
    These letters were written on the borders of the country, at the edge of blazing steel furnaces, on hospital beds, in green fields, in science laboratories, in school classrooms, and on speeding trains. Some were even written while taking care of children. The writers of these letters were not all intellectuals; a large proportion were illiterate or semi-literate workers, farmers, and other working people. They could not write letters or complete one, but after seeing and hearing speeches opposing the Communist Party and the socialist system, they were so emotionally moved that they had to ask others to write down their opinions. Hou Jiashan, a handicraftsman and tuberculosis patient recuperating at the Second Sanatorium in the western suburbs of Beijing, asked Hou Junxia to write for him. Chen Dequan, a veteran from Hebei, because he knew so few characters, wrote a letter of more than 300 words five times before completing it. He said in his letter: "I have so much to say, but I can't express it, I can't write it." Therefore, he had to repeat in the letter: "I have sharp eyes and a determination to defend the Party and defend the motherland." Workers and students living in Beijing personally delivered their letters to the newspaper office so that the newspaper could receive them a day earlier. The letter from all the students of Class 2 of the third grade of the Beijing Foreign Affairs Institute was delivered by a special person, and they requested that this newspaper publish their letter; if the full text could not be published, a section or a few sentences could be excerpted so that the people of the whole country would know that the students stood firmly with the workers, farmers, and the people of the whole country. Although these letters came from different regions and different posts, their hearts were one, firmly opposing any remarks that deviated from socialism.

　　Yang Zengzhan wrote in his letter:
　　No One Has Starved to Death in Yulin Since the Implementation of Unified Purchase and Sales
    Regarding Ge Peiqi's erroneous statement that "unified purchase and sales have messed things up," many letters used vivid and specific materials to prove that, from a comprehensive perspective, this work was not bad but good. Zheng Shifan, a grain worker, wrote in his letter: Last year, there were tens of millions of disaster victims across the country. Without implementing unified purchase and sales, without unified national allocation of grain, what would so many disaster victims eat? They would only starve to death. Yang Zengzhan, a student at the Beijing Agricultural Cadre School whose home is in Yulin, northern Shaanxi, wrote in his letter: "Since liberation, although northern Shaanxi has suffered from droughts year after year, such as the drought in 1951, the flood in 1954, and the drought again in 1955, no one starved to death in the entire county of Yulin. I personally heard many farmers say with gratitude: If the government had not implemented unified purchase and sales and social relief, many people would have starved to death as in the past." Ru Ping from Shunyi County, Hebei, wrote in her letter: Last year, Hebei suffered from a flood, and the grain produced was not enough for the province to eat. The state transported grain from Sichuan, Hunan, and many other provinces, spending a lot on transportation costs, but still sold it to the people at eight cents per catty of corn and one dime and five cents per catty of rice. This is because of the implementation of unified purchase and sales.

　　A Worker from the Forest Area Wrote in His Letter:
    We Used to Sleep on Tree Branches, Now We've Moved into Nice Houses
    Many readers used the changes in their families over the past few years to prove that the statement "Who has seen their living standards improve? The Party cadres who used to wear broken shoes are now sitting in small cars and wearing woolen uniforms" is wrong. A letter from the women of the Dongsi District streets in Beijing said: This is lying with eyes wide open, this is intentionally inciting the people to leave the Communist Party. They said in their letter: "Li Duanrong, a family member of a staff member, pointed to her white and fat child of more than ten months and said: In the past, children from families like ours could not have eaten cod liver oil or fruit. If this child could speak, he would definitely ask Ge Peiqi who he is representing." Zhang Shuchun and Yu Zhicheng, who work in the primitive forests of Changbai Mountain, wrote in their letter: To see whether the living standards of the people have improved, please look at the changes in the lives of the forest workers:
　　In the past, the vegetables eaten by forest workers were legless shrimp (soybean sprouts) and soup made with two radishes in a pot of water. The rice was coarse corn, and they couldn't even eat their fill. They wore tattered clothes made of homespun cloth and lived in leaky shacks. When sleeping, they laid pine branches underneath and covered themselves with tattered burlap sacks. In a word, the lives of the workers were truly like those of cattle and horses. Now they live in warm dormitories, especially with family dormitories. They eat both coarse and fine grains, and wear clothes made of foreign cloth. In addition, the state has established bathhouses, barbershops, health stations, laundries, and allocated a batch of living subsidies. Wang Yongfu received a state subsidy because he had no money to treat his elderly parents. Zhao Fusheng, whose home is in Shanxi, wrote in his letter: In the past, three generations of my family worked desperately, my elderly grandfather vomited blood from exhaustion, and my young self also ruined my health, but we still had to live on chaff and wild vegetables. My mother died of illness, and two younger brothers starved to death. Finally, my father had no choice but to send my older sister and me to an orphanage run by foreigners to live a life of slavery. After liberation, the government cared for and looked after us meticulously, and gave us learning opportunities. Now, I am studying at an agricultural college. Many letters also acknowledged that the lives of people in a few disaster areas were relatively difficult, but this was because they had suffered disasters; if compared with past disaster years, their lives were much better than before.

　　Yao Gongxiao wrote in his letter:
　　Countless Respectable Communist Party Members Shed Their Last Drop of Blood for the Motherland
    Many readers criticized Ge Peiqi's statement that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has messed things up." They made a concrete analysis of Wang Dezhou's "Communist Party members do all kinds of evil" and Chu Anping's "Party-controlled world" fallacies, pointing out that the purpose of these people was to attempt to alienate the relationship between the Party and the people and to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Yao Gongxiao, a veteran who had already returned home, wrote in his letter that he wanted to speak up for the Communist Party members. He listed the deeds of countless Communist Party members in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who endured hardship first and enjoyed comfort later, and even bravely sacrificed their lives for the motherland and the people. He said: In the War of Liberation, in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and in the struggle against the enemy on the front lines of the motherland's various border and coastal defenses, thousands upon thousands of soldiers shed their last drop of blood for the motherland. When they sacrificed their lives, when they ate fried noodles and snow in the severe cold of minus thirty degrees, they were thinking of enabling the people of the whole country to live a peaceful and happy life. Now, there are also thousands upon thousands of soldiers far away from their hometowns and relatives, guarding the gate of the motherland day and night with loyalty. Among these unsung heroes loved by the vast number of people are countless Communist Party members, who always step forward in the face of difficulties.

    Chen Jiguan from Hexi Central School in Shanghai County wrote in his letter: If "Party-controlled world" refers to the world of the working people, what's wrong with that? It's very good. Mao Aohai of the Mongolian nationality, Wang Ke, Zhang Yingda, Mian Weilin, and Bai Jie of the Hui nationality, Huang Jiandong, Zang Dong, and Lin Minshu of the Zhuang nationality, Bai Yunchang and Piao Shengri of the Korean nationality, Tian Fuda of the Gaoshan nationality, Kamilijiang of the Uzbek nationality, and Li Qi of the Naxi nationality, who work in the National Committee of the National People's Congress, wrote in their letter: "Your (Ge Peiqi, etc.) attempts will never be realized, and the people of all nationalities who have been liberated will never allow it." Yu Ruihuang, a professor in the Department of Physics at Northeast People's University and a member of the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote in his letter: In order to further support the Party's cause with concrete actions, I want to dedicate everything to the Party, and I want to apply to the Party organization to join the Party. Xiao Ling, a freshman in the Department of History at Shandong University, said a sentence that everyone wanted to say: Long live the Communist Party of China, is the happiness of the Chinese people, is the sorrow of the counter-revolutionaries.

　　Jin Hongzhi wrote in his letter:
    Writing Anonymous Letters of Intimidation and Threats is a Provocation to the People of the Whole Country
    After the newspaper published the news on the 7th that Lu Yuwen, Assistant Secretary-General of the State Council, had received anonymous threatening letters, a large part of the readers' letters denounced the practice of writing anonymous threatening letters. Jin Hongzhi, a staff member of the Legal Affairs Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, wrote in his letter: "Judging from the method of intimidation with anonymous letters and the content of the anonymous letters, this does not seem to come from within the people, and there is no atmosphere of unity-criticism-unity at all. Anyone with a normal sense of smell can easily identify what kind of taste this is. This is not only a threat and intimidation to Lu Yuwen and Li Zhonggong, but a provocation to all the people who support socialism and the Communist Party's leadership." Zhou Jianduan and Lin Feng of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese wrote in their letter: "The person who wrote the threatening letter to Mr. Lu Yuwen adopted the old methods of Kuomintang secret agents. His behavior is so despicable and shameful, and his remarks are so vicious and hateful, that he is truly shameless to the extreme."

    Many readers also refuted the remarks of Zhang Naiqi, Yang Yuqing, Chen Xingui, and others.

    Many readers' letters expressed that they did not deny the shortcomings and errors in their current work, but these shortcomings and errors must be specifically analyzed and distinguished. Zhang Hanying from Xinjiang Petroleum Company wrote in his letter: The three major isms exist, but this is a shortcoming and error of some leading cadres, and cannot be said to be the entire Party.

    右派分子的猖狂进攻
　　激起了千万读者的愤怒
    各地报纸刊登葛佩琦、储安平、章乃器和杨玉清等反对共产党、反对社会主义的言论后，全国各地工人、农民、学生、教员、市民纷纷给本报来信，痛斥这些言论。10日到14日五天内，本报收到了三千五百六十六件来信，其中有个人写的，也有几个人或集体签名的。
　　一边看孩子一边写不会写的托人代笔
    这些来信有的是在国境边上写的，有的是在炽热炼钢炉边写的，有的是在医院的病床上写的，有的是在绿色的田野写的，有的是在科学实验室中写的，有的是在学校课室中写的，有的是在飞驰的列车上写的，也有的是一边照料孩子一边执笔写的。写这些信的人并不都是知识分子，其中有很大一部分是目不识丁或识字不多的工人、农民和其他劳动人民。他们不会写信或者写不成一封信，但是在看到和听到反对共产党、反对社会制度的言论后，心情激动得不能不请人代笔发表自己的意见。正在北京西郊第二疗养院疗养的肺结核病患者、手工业工人侯家山，请侯俊霞代笔。河北复员军人陈德?因为识字很少，写了五次才写成一封三百多字的信。他在信上说：“我有多少要说的话呀，就是说不出来，写不出来。”因此，他只得在信上重复地说：“我有一双雪亮的眼睛，有一颗保卫党、保卫祖国的决心。”住在北京的工人、学生，为了让报社早一天接到他们的信，亲自把信送到报社来。北京外交学院三年级二班全体学生的信，是派专人送来的，并且要求本报刊登他们的信；不能全文刊登，摘登一段或几句话都可以，让全国人民知道，学生是坚决地和工人、农民及全国人民站在一起的。这些来信虽然来自不同的地区不同的岗位，但是心是一颗，坚决反对任何离开社会主义的言论。
　　杨增占信中写道：
　　实行统购统销以来榆林没饿死一个人
    对葛佩琦的“统购统销搞糟了”的错误言论，许多来信用生动具体的材料证明：从全面来看，这个工作不是糟而是好的。粮食工作者郑时藩来信说：去年全国有上千万的灾民，要不实行统购统销，要不全国统一调度粮食，这么多灾民吃什么？只好活活的饿死。家在陕北榆林的北京农业部干部学校学生杨增占来信说：“解放后，陕北虽然连年遭受灾荒，如1951年的旱灾，1954年的水灾，1955年又是旱灾，但榆林全县没有饿死一个人。我亲耳听到许多农民怀着感激的心情说：如果政府不实行统购统销和社会救济，一定像过去一样的要饿死不少人。”河北顺义县茹萍来信说：去年河北受了水灾，打的粮食不够本省吃，国家就从四川、湖南等许多省运来粮食，花的运费不少，卖给人民时仍是玉米每斤八分，大米每斤一角五分。这就因为实行了统购统销。
　　林区工人信中写道：
    过去睡在树枝上现在搬进好房子
    许多读者用几年来家庭的变化的情形，证明：“生活水平提高的哪些人呢？过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车穿呢制服的党员干部”的说法是错误的。北京东四区街道妇女的来信中说：这是闭着眼睛说瞎话，这是有意煽动人民离开共产党。她们在来信中说：“职员家属李端荣指着自己的十多个月又白又胖的孩子说：过去，像我们这样家的孩子，那能吃得上鱼肝油、水果。要是这孩子会说话，一定也要质问葛佩琦代表谁说话。”在长白山原始森林中工作的张树春、于志成的来信说：人民的生活水平是不是提高了，请看看
　　林区工人生活的变化情形：
　　过去林区工人吃的菜是无腿大虾米（黄豆芽）和一锅水放二个萝
  卜的汤，饭是飞机牌的大楂子（苞米一磨两半啦），而且不能吃饱；穿的是更生布破衣裳，住的是落天的马架房，睡觉时，下面铺着松树枝，上边盖着破麻袋，一句话，工人的生活真如牛马。现在住的是温暖的宿舍，特别是有了家属宿舍。吃的是粗粮和细粮，穿的是洋布衣服。此外，国家设立了洗澡塘、理发室、保健站、洗衣坊和拨出一批生活补助金。王永福无钱给老人治病，就得到了国家的补助金。家在山西的赵福生来信说：过去我家同堂三代拚死拚活的作活，年老的爷爷累的吐了血，年小的我也累坏了身体，可是还得靠糠皮、野菜过日子。母亲病死，两个弟弟饿死，最后，父亲不得不把姐姐和我送到外国人所办的孤儿院，过那奴隶般的生活。解放后，政府无微不至的关怀和照顾我们，并给我们学习机会。现在，我在农学院学习。许多来信也承认少数灾区人民的生活是比较困难的，但这是因为遭受了灾害；如果同过去的灾害年来比较，生活也比前好得多。
　　姚功效信中写道：
　　无数可敬的共产党员为祖国流尽最后一滴血
    许多读者对葛佩琦的“肃反搞糟了”作了批判。对王德周的“共产党员无恶不作”，储安平的“党天下”等谬论作了具体分析，指出这些人的目的是企图离间党和人民的关系和取消无产阶级专政。已经复员回家的军人姚功效来信说，他要替共产党员说话。他列举了中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军中无数的共产党员吃苦在先、享受在后，甚至为祖国、为人民英勇地献出自己的生命的事迹。他说：在解放战争中、在抗美援朝战争中、在祖国的各个边防、海防前线对敌斗争中，有千千万万的战士们为祖国流尽了最后一滴血。当他们牺牲自己的生命的时候，当他们在零下三十度的严寒里吃着炒面和雪的时候，他们想到的是为了使全国人民安静地过着幸福生活。现在又有着千千万万的战士们远离了家乡、亲人，在祖国的边境上日日夜夜忠心耿耿地守卫着祖国的大门。这些为广大人民爱戴的无名英雄中有无数的共产党员，他们总是在困难面前挺身而出的。
    上海县荷溪中心学校陈纪官来信说：如果“党天下”指的是劳动人民的天下，这有什么不好呢？好的很。在全国人民代表大会民族委员会工作的蒙古族茂敖海、回族王克、张英达、勉维霖、白洁，僮族黄建东、臧冬、林敏淑，朝鲜族白云昌、朴胜一，高山族田富达，乌兹别克族卡米里江，纳西族李淇在来信中说：“你们（葛佩琦等）的企图是永远不能实现的，翻了身的全国各民族人民是绝不允许的。”东北人民大学物理系教授、中国科学院数理化学部委员余瑞璜来信说：为了用具体行动进一步拥护党的事业，我要把一切献给党，我要向党组织申请入党。山东大学历史系一年级肖玲来信说出了大家想说的一句话：中国共产党万岁，是中国人民的幸福，是反革命分子的悲哀。
　　金鸿志信中写道：
    写匿名信恐吓威胁是对全国人民挑衅
    7日报上刊登了国务院秘书长助理卢郁文接到匿名恐吓信的消息以后，读者来信中就有很大一部分是痛斥这种写匿名恐吓信勾当的。全国人民代表大会常委会办公厅法律室工作人员金鸿志来信说：“从用匿名信恫吓的手法和匿名信的内容来看，这不像来自人民内部，丝毫找不到团结——批评——团结的气氛。凡是嗅觉正常的人，不难识别出这是一种什么味道。这不仅是对卢郁文、李仲公两个人的威胁、恫吓，而是对一切拥护社会主义和共产党领导政权的人民的挑衅。”中华全国归国华侨联合会周简段、临风的来信中说：“给卢郁文先生写恐吓信的人采取了国民党特务分子的老手段。其行为之卑鄙可耻，其言论之恶毒可恨，真是无耻之尤。”
    许多读者对章乃器、杨玉清、陈新桂等的言论，也都进行了批驳。
    许多读者来信表示并不否认现在工作中的缺点和错误，但是对这些缺点和错误必须进行具体分析加以分别。新疆石油公司张汉英来信说：三大主义是存在的，但是这是一部分领导干部的缺点和错误，不能说成是整个党的。
