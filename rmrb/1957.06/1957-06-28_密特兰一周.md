　　A Week in the Midlands

　　Three, At the Top of the "Pyramid"

　　Henkok, the production general manager of the Rootes Motors, painted a picture of the British automobile industry for us. This British industrialist was all soft lines: plump cheeks, a slightly bulging belly. In a very confident tone, he said: "In Birmingham and Coventry, everything from earth to diamonds serves the five major automobile companies. There are four thousand manufacturers in different industries working for us. This is a pyramid. We stand at the top of the pyramid."

　　We have no doubt about Henkok's words. He was not exaggerating at all. The five major companies are: British Motor Corporation (formed by the merger of Austin and Nuffield), Ford Motor Company (a subsidiary of the American Ford Motor Company), Standard Motor Company, Rootes Group, and Vauxhall Motors. The five major companies control 90% of the production of automobiles and light vehicles in the UK; in the past year, they produced a total of 1.25 million cars, trucks, and tractors. According to the British Motor Corporation, two out of every five vehicles on British roads are manufactured by the company.

　　The automobile industry in Britain is called "new industrial sector", to distinguish it from the textile industry, the coal mining industry... The so-called "new" is not only because it was established later, but also because it is equipped with brand-new technology. The main bases of the automobile industry are Birmingham and Coventry. A British friend in Birmingham told us that in this city with a population of 1.25 million, 50% to 60% of the people are directly or indirectly serving the automobile industry.

　　We visited Rootes on the third day after arriving in Birmingham. Barlow, the company's export manager, drove a black car to Birmingham to pick us up. The car headed towards Coventry against the sun. It was a rare sunny day.

　　Barlow, who didn't talk much, told us a piece of news on the way: recently, they bought the Singer Motors in Birmingham. In that case, the Rootes Group will have thirteen companies.

　　In less than an hour, we arrived at our destination. We sat in the office of Wybrow, the Rootes' public relations director. In a spacious and bright room next door, there were a dozen types of cars manufactured by the company. The compact and exquisite one was the "Minx"; the one with a flat head and big belly, crawling on the ground like a toad, was the new "Humber Hawk"... Each car was matched with two colors: black and red, cream and sky blue... The showroom looked like a fashion exhibition.

　　Wybrow stroked the "Minx" affectionately and told us: "This is a bestseller now. It's fuel-efficient and inexpensive. We send it to the Americas to compete with the United States!"

　　Turning around, he introduced the new "Humber Hawk" to us and made a mysterious face: "It's not going to be put on the market yet. It's still a secret."

　　We learned from the conversation with General Manager Henkok that constantly changing the style of cars will inevitably increase the cost of cars; and whether a style will be welcomed by customers is not certain in advance. He said, "It takes risks." However, when we made a joking suggestion, asking them to make an agreement not to change the style, he hurriedly waved his hands and made a gesture of refusal:

　　"That's the end! That's the end! It's like forcing women to wear the same clothes."

　　The problem is not whether to force women to wear the same clothes, but competition. 50% of the Rootes Group's cars are exported. The export proportion of the other four major companies is similar, or even higher. In the capitalist world market, British cars rank first in exports to various countries. However, in recent years, Britain has encountered a formidable opponent: West Germany. If Britain wants to maintain its position, it has to rely on these black and cream-colored "Minx" and its companions. They sometimes lower their heads and sometimes raise their tails... constantly changing their appearance and color in order to win the joy of customers.

　　Wybrow and Barlow accompanied us to visit the workshop with an area of 300,000 square feet. Standing at one end of the workshop, we could hardly see the other end. The steel pipes hanging from the ceiling to the machines were arranged in depth, like a forest. The machines roared, and the conveyor belts were turning... This is what we saw in one of the Rootes Group's factories.

　　The production situation is very moving. From a plan view, the workshop is arranged like an abacus: dozens of "production lines" are arranged vertically, and each "production line" is densely packed with machines. All the "production lines" are connected by a horizontal line, which is the conveyor belt. Many machines are automated, and are taken care of by one or two workers; it can continuously perform a dozen processes. The conveyor belt moves slowly forward. At its starting point, someone puts on a part. Each time it passes a "production line", another part is added. At the end of the conveyor belt, a brand-new engine is born. The conveyor belt moves continuously, and an engine is produced every minute.

　　In another workshop, we saw the same conveyor belt. Its starting point is a car frame; when it moves forward, someone installs the engine, someone installs the axle, and someone else only tightens a few screws... Finally, colorful cars come out.

　　We stood at the exit of this workshop. Every two and a half minutes, a car drove away in front of us, like a new recruit, fully armed, rushing to the world market.

　　Wybrow told us proudly:

　　"Some people say that automation will cause unemployment. We have overturned this theory. We have implemented automation and also guaranteed full employment."

　　This reminded me of the opinion of another British friend - Wurm, the chairman of the grassroots trade union of the Standard Motor Company. He said: "Automation has not yet caused large-scale unemployment, mainly because the 'prosperity' of British industry has not disappeared."

　　And how long can the "prosperity" of British industry last? This is precisely the key issue.

　　密特兰一周
　　三、在“金字塔”的顶端
    鲁茨汽车公司的生产总经理亨柯克为我们描绘出英国汽车工业的一幅图画。这位英国工业家混身上下的线条都显得十分柔和：丰润的脸颊，微微鼓起的肚子。他用很自信的语气说：“在伯明翰和考文垂，从泥土到钻石，都为五大汽车公司服务。有四千个不同行业的厂家，为我们工作着。这是个金字塔。我们，站在金字塔的顶端”。
    我们毫不怀疑亨柯克的谈话。他一点也没有夸张。五大公司是：英国汽车公司（由奥斯汀公司和纳菲尔德公司合并成），福特汽车公司（它是美国福特公司的子公司），标准汽车公司，鲁茨公司和韦赫豪尔公司。五大公司控制了英国小汽车和轻型车辆生产的90％；在去年一年中，它们共生产了汽车、卡车和拖拉机一百二十五万辆。据英国汽车公司宣布，在英国道路上行驶的车辆，每五辆中有二辆是由该公司制造的。
    汽车工业在英国被称为“新的工业部门”，以区别于纺织工业、采煤工业……。所谓“新”，不仅是因为它建立得较晚，而且是用崭新的技术装备起来的。汽车工业的主要基地是伯明翰和考文垂。伯明翰的一个英国朋友告诉我们：在这拥有一百二十五万人口的城市里，有50％到60％的人是直接或间接为汽车工业服务的。
    我们去鲁茨参观，是在到达伯明翰后的第三天。这个公司的出口经理巴洛，驾着一辆黑色的小汽车到伯明翰来接我们。汽车迎着太阳向考文垂驶去。这是一个难得碰到的晴天。
    不大爱说话的巴洛，在半途上告诉我们一个消息：最近，他们把伯明翰的胜家汽车公司买过来了。这么说来，鲁茨集团就有了十三个公司。
    不到一小时，就到了目的地。我们坐在鲁茨的交际处长怀勃的办公室里。旁边一间宽敞明亮的大屋子，陈列着该公司制造的十来种小汽车。小巧玲珑的是“明克斯”；扁脑袋、大肚子，像蛤蟆一样爬在地上的，是新型的“亨姆勃·豪克”……。每辆汽车都是由两种颜色搭配起来的：黑色间红色，乳白配天蓝……。陈列室很像个时装展览会。
    怀勃爱抚地摸摸“明克斯”，告诉我们：“现在这是畅销货。它省油，价钱又便宜。我们把它送到美洲大陆去，和美国竞争！”
    转过身来，他把新型的“亨姆勃·豪克”介绍给我们，并且做了个神秘的脸色：“现在还不拿到市场上去。它，还是个秘密。”
    我们从总经理亨柯克的谈话中了解到：不时地改变汽车式样，必然要提高汽车成本；而一种式样会不会受到顾客的欢迎，事先是没有把握的。他说，“这需要冒险。”但是，当我们提了个开玩笑的建议，请他们几个公司订立个不改变式样的协定时，他又急忙摆动两手，做了个拒绝的姿势：
    “这就完蛋了！这就完蛋了！这等于强迫妇女穿一样的衣服。”
    问题不在于是不是要强迫妇女穿一样的衣服，而是：竞争。鲁茨集团的汽车，50％是出口的。其他四大公司的出口比重，也与此相近，或者更大一些。在资本主义世界市场上，英国的汽车在各国的出口中占第一位。但是，这几年来英国碰到了劲敌：西德。英国要想保持自己的阵地，就得指望这些黑色的、乳白色的“明克斯”和它的同伴。它们有时低下脑袋，有时又翘起尾巴……不断地改变自己的模样和色彩，以博得顾客的喜悦。
    怀勃和巴洛陪同我们参观面积达三十万平方英尺的车间。站在车间的一头，几乎望不到它的另一头。从上空垂到机器上来的一根根钢管，纵深排列，像树林一样。机器轰鸣着，传送带在转运……。这就是我们在鲁茨集团的一个工厂里所看到的景象。
    生产的情况是很动人的。从平面看，车间布置得像个算盘一样：纵列着几十道“生产线”，每道“生产线”上密密地摆满了机器。所有的“生产线”由一根横线贯穿起来，这就是传送带。许多机器是自动化的，由一两个工人照管着；它可以连续做十几道工序。传送带缓缓地向前移动。在它的起点，有人放上一个部件。每经过一道“生产线”，就再加上一个部件。到了传送带的终点，一辆崭新的引擎诞生了。传送带在川流不息地移动，每分钟就有一部引擎生产出来。
    在另一个车间，我们看到的也是同样的传送带。它的起点，是一个车架；当它向前移动的时候，有人按上引擎，有人装上车轴，有人又只管拧几下螺丝……最后，五颜六色的汽车出来了。
    我们站在这个车间的出口处。每两分半钟，就有一辆汽车在我们面前开走，好像一个新入伍的士兵，全副武装地冲向世界市场。
    怀勃很自豪地告诉我们：
    “有人说，自动化要引起失业。我们推翻了这种理论。我们实行了自动化，又保证了充分就业。”
    这使我想起了另外一个英国朋友——渥姆，标准汽车公司基层工会的主席——的意见。他说：“自动化还没有引起大规模的失业，主要是因为英国工业的‘繁荣’还没有消失。”
    而英国工业的“繁荣”能支持多久？这正是问题的关键所在。
