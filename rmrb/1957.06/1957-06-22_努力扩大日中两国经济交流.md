　　Strive to Expand Economic Exchanges Between Japan and China
　　Den Kawakatsu, Chairman of the Kansai General Bureau Executive Committee of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Manager of Japan Spinning Spindle Co., Ltd.
    Under the strong demands of peace-loving people all over the world and the Japanese people, Japan restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union at the end of last year, and then restored diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia and Poland, laying a reliable foundation for creating a new and historically significant situation in Japanese diplomacy. This is truly gratifying for world peace. Furthermore, the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and other countries will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the normalization of Japan-China relations, which we have been looking forward to for many years. This is clearly reflected in the fact that the Japan Socialist Party has made the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations a party policy and has sent an official delegation to Beijing, giving new impetus to the promotion of the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. It should be particularly emphasized that all sectors of Japan have warmly responded to the talks between the Socialist Party delegation and Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and others, as well as the joint statement, and the Japanese government and ruling party have also shown subtle reactions. This is nothing more than an indication that, with the development of the international situation, the national force demanding the realization of the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations is also growing in Japan. As we all know, since the Geneva Conference, although there have been several twists and turns, the basic direction of the world situation is indeed clearly moving towards détente; the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have received enthusiastic resonance from the people of all countries, and the governments of many countries have adopted the Five Principles as the basic guidelines of their foreign policy. In the midst of such developing internal and external situations, it is still necessary to create mature conditions for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. I think that in the international environment surrounding Japan, it is necessary to make many efforts to solve this problem, but at the present stage, vigorously expanding economic exchanges between the two countries is of particular importance.
    If we take into account the historical and geographical relationship between Japan and China, the existence of mutually beneficial economic relations, and the strong demands for economic exchanges between Japan and China arising from the development of the great economic construction plan of New China, then, in promoting economic exchanges between the two countries, we must guide the current negativity of the classes that have a great influence on the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations and the potential demands for economic exchanges that contradict this towards the correct direction of resolution.
    I believe that even some people who oppose the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations have no basis to oppose expanding economic exchanges.
    The unanimous demand of Japan's industrial and commercial circles and the people for expanding Japan-China economic exchanges is a great force that will encourage and inspire the Japanese government to actively promote economic diplomacy between Japan and China.
    The development of economic demands will promote the solution of political problems.
    I am one of those who, for the eternal common interests of the two peoples and world peace, are willing to contribute my meager strength from the above point of view. (Attached picture)

　　努力扩大日中两国经济交流
　　日本国际贸易促进协会关西总局执行委员会主席  日本纺锤股份有限公司经理  川胜传
    在全世界爱好和平的人民和日本国民的强烈要求下，去年年底日本同苏联恢复了邦交，接着又和捷克斯洛伐克、波兰复交，为日本外交开创具有历史意义的新局面打下了可靠的基础，这对于世界和平来说实在是非常可喜的事情。而日本和苏联等国复交，对于我们多年所盼望的日中关系正常化，不能不说将发生良好的作用。这明显地表现在日本社会党把恢复日中邦交作为党的政策，并且派遣正式代表团到北京，对促进日中复交给予了新的影响。特别应该强调的是，日本各界对社会党代表团和毛主席、周总理等的恳谈以及共同声明热烈反响，而且日本政府和执政党也有着微妙的反应。这不外是表示了随着国际形势的发展，在日本国内，要求实现日中复交的国民力量也正在成长。众所周知，从日内瓦会议以来，虽经过几度波折，但世界局势的基本方向确实是明显地朝着缓和的方向前进；和平五项原则得到了各国人民热烈的共鸣，许多国家的政府都采纳了五项原则作为外交政策的基本纲领。在这样发展着的内外形势中，仍然有必要为日中复交创造成熟条件。我想，在围绕日本的国际环境之中，为解决这个问题有必要作很多努力，但在现阶段，努力扩大两国间的经济交流，是具有特殊重要意义的。
    如果考虑到日中两国历史上和地理上的关系和有无相通的经济关系，以及基于新中国的伟大经济建设计划的发展而产生的对日中两国间经济交流的强烈要求等等，那末在促进两国间的经济交流的时候，就要把对日中复交有很大影响力的阶层的眼前的消极性和与此对立的潜在的对经济交流的要求的矛盾，朝向正确的解决方向加以引导。
    我认为，即使反对日中复交的一部分人也没有任何根据反对扩大经济交流。
    日本的工商业界和国民对扩大日中经济交流的一致要求是一个很大的力量，将鼓舞和激励日本政府积极推进日中两国间的经济外交。
    经济上的要求的发展，将促进政治问题的解决。
    我就是为了两国国民的永恒的共同利益和世界和平，愿从上述观点贡献微薄力量的人们里的一个。（附图片）
