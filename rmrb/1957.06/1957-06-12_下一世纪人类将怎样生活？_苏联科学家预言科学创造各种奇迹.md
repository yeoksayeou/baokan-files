Moscow, June 11th (People's Daily dispatch) What will the future world be like? What miracles will science create in the 21st century? Fifteen prominent Soviet scientists shared their predictions in the "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on the 9th.

    Humans Enter the Plastic Age

    The future is born from today. Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: In the next few months, artificial satellites will appear on Earth. This temporary small laboratory will report on what happens hundreds of kilometers above the ground via radio signals, especially the secrets of the ionosphere and cosmic rays. Soviet scientists have already solved the technical difficulties of manufacturing and launching artificial satellites. Equipment has been manufactured to realize this ideal of mankind. Nesmeyanov is a leading figure in the field of organic chemistry. He predicts that in the 21st century, people will only wear clothes made of artificial textiles, shoes and boots made of artificial leather, and fur coats made of synthetic fur. Many things around them will be made of artificial materials. After the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, mankind is now entering the Plastic Age.

    Miracle Drugs Accelerate Crop Growth

    How many people can the Earth feed? Academician Wolfkovich replied: Mendeleev said more than fifty years ago that the Earth could find food for tens of billions of people, not only through labor but also through invention. Now the Earth's food supply is sufficient to feed two to three billion people. When the population multiplies to this limit in the future, the capacity to produce will greatly increase again. He said: Several crops are currently treated with growth accelerators. In a few years, dozens or hundreds of crops will be treated with growth accelerators. These stimulants will allow crops such as potatoes to be harvested twice a year. This drug is very strange; a small amount can promote growth, and an excessive amount can slow growth. It can prevent potatoes from sprouting in warehouses for a long time, prevent fruits from falling before they ripen, and keep roses blooming for weeks.

    Conquering Cancer, Shortening Sleep

    The most threatening disease to humans now is cancer. In the near future, humans will understand the nature of cancer. Academician Engelgardt made such an optimistic prediction. He said: By then, effective treatments for cancer can be devised. Even the most cautious experts believe that this victory will be achieved within twenty years. Conquering diseases is one way to extend life. Another way is to shorten sleep, as one-third of the day is taken up by sleep. After understanding the nature of fatigue toxins in nerve cells, a way will be found to neutralize fatigue toxins with yeast or drugs. It is also possible to use electrical oscillations to accelerate the brain's recovery process, making one or two hours of sleep a day sufficient.

    Submersible Ships Cross the Ocean

    A type of ship sails on the Volga River with wings under the hull. When the ship is sailing, these wings in the water have the same lifting effect as the wings of an airplane in the air. Corresponding Academician Zwankov said: The shape of ships will fundamentally change in the future. In the 21st century, ships crossing the great oceans could be submersible, which will reduce the impact of wind and waves. Ships will be equipped with atomic engines.

    Pocket radios made with semiconductors are no longer rare. Academician Kochetkov predicts that pocket televisions will appear in the future. He described the scene of the 21st century: At that time, you can pick up a TV transceiver the size of a cigarette case and talk to relatives and friends elsewhere, and you can take out this TV in the field to watch a ball game in a stadium.

    Thousands of Miles of Desert Bloom

    Future geographers will transform from recorders of nature to creators of nature. This is Academician Shcherbakov's view. He said: Research on the influence of ocean currents has made it possible to predict what changes will occur in the climate when encountering certain deviations in the direction of warm currents. Presumably, future societies will not only be able to change ocean currents but also change the direction of air currents. At that time, a humid climate will be created in the desert, allowing flowers to bloom there, and the permafrost areas of Siberia, North America, and even Greenland will be thawed; the climate of the continents will be harmonized.

### 下一世纪人类将怎样生活？  苏联科学家预言科学创造各种奇迹

　　下一世纪人类将怎样生活？
    苏联科学家预言科学创造各种奇迹
    本报莫斯科11日电  未来世界将是怎样的？科学发展到二十一世纪将会创造什么奇迹？苏联十五位著名科学家在9日“共青真理报”上畅谈了自己的预测。
    人类进入塑料时代
    未来是从今天诞生的。苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士说：在最近若干月内地球将出现人造卫星。这个临时小实验室，将以无线电波信号报告在几百公里高空发生的事情，特别是电离层和宇宙射线的隐秘。苏联科学家已经解决了制造和放射人造卫星的技术困难。已经制造出实现人类这种理想的设备。涅斯米扬诺夫是有机化学界的泰斗。他预测：人们在二十一世纪穿的将只是人造纺织品制的衣服，人造皮制的鞋靴，合成毛皮制的皮袄。他们周围的许多东西都将是由人造材料制的。人类经过石器、铜器、铁器时代，现在进入了塑料时代。
    妙药加速作物生长
    地球上可以养活多少人口呢？沃尔夫科维奇院士回答：门德列夫在五十多年前就说过，地球上找得到好几百亿人口的食物，这不单靠劳动，还要靠发明。现在地球上的食物足以养活二三百亿人口。未来人口繁殖到这个界限的时候，生产的能力又大大增长。他说：现在有几种作物施用速长剂。若干年以后，将会有几十种几百种作物施用速长剂。这种刺激剂将使马铃薯等作物一年收成两次。这种药剂很奇怪，少量可以助长，过量可以缓长。它可以使马铃薯在仓库里长期不发芽，可以使水果成熟不落地；可以使玫瑰花开几星期不谢。
    战胜癌病缩短睡眠
    现在最威胁人类的疾病是癌。不久的将来，人类将会弄明癌的本性。恩格尔加尔特院士作了这样乐观的预言。他说：到时候就可以想出治癌的有效疗法。甚至最谨慎的专家也认为，这个胜利将在二十年内达到。战胜疾病，是延长寿命的一种方法。另一法是缩短睡眠，因为一天的三分之一的时间要被睡眠占去。在弄明神经细胞的疲劳素的本性以后，将会找到办法，用酵母或药剂使疲劳素失效。也可能用电力的振荡加速脑子疲劳的恢复过程，使一天睡一两小时就够了。
    潜水轮船横渡大洋
    伏尔加河上航行着一种轮船，船身下面有翼。当轮船航行时，这个在水里的翼，起着飞机在空中的翼一样上升的作用。兹汪科夫通讯院士说：将来轮船的形状将根本改观。在二十一世纪，横渡大海洋的轮船可以是潜水式的，这将减少风浪的影响。轮船将装配原子能发动机。
    用半导体制造的袖珍收音机现在已经不算稀奇。科切尔尼科夫院士预计，未来将有袖珍电视机出现。他描绘二十一世纪的情景说：到时可以拿起烟盒大小的电视收发机和在别处的亲友谈话，可以在野外掏出这个电视机看一场运动场上的球赛。
    千里沙漠百花齐放
    未来的地理学家将从自然的记载者变为自然的创造者。这是谢尔巴科夫院士的看法。他说：关于海洋暖流的影响的研究，使得现在遇着暖流的方向发生某些偏差，可以预报气候会有什么变化。大概，未来社会将不但能够改变海流而且能够改变气流的方向。到时候将在沙漠上创造潮湿的气候，使那里百花齐放，将使西伯利亚、北美洲甚至格陵兰终古不化的冻结地带解冻；将使大陆的气候调和。
