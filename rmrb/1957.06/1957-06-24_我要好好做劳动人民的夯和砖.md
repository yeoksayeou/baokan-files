I Want to Be a Good Rammer and Brick for the Working People
　　Ke Zhongping
    This was written after participating in labor at the construction site of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Today (June 22nd), I recited this poem when speaking out against the rightists at the Jiangsu delegation meeting of the National People's Congress.

　　Carried bricks for a while,
　　Sweated for a while,
　　A worker took off his straw hat to put it on me,
　　I said: It’s been a long time since I labored with you, my thoughts have become a little moldy, today, I want the sun to give me a good baking.

　　Carried bricks again for a while,
　　Sweated again for a while,
　　A worker brought a large bowl of boiled water and asked me to drink it,
　　I said: This is the wine of the working class, let's drink and drain it together.

　　The work here is finished,
　　The work over there is still going on,
　　I hurried over, jumped into the pit,
　　And rammed with the workers,
　　I sang: I want to be a good rammer for the working class, I want to be a good brick for the working people.

　　我要好好做劳动人民的夯和砖
　　柯仲平
    这是在一次参加西安交通大学建设工地劳动后写的。今天（6月22日）在全国人民代表大会江苏代表组会上，我发言反对右派时，朗诵了这首诗。
　　搬了一阵砖，
　　流了一阵汗，
　　有工人脱下他的草帽来给我戴，
　　我说：我好久不同您们一起劳动了，我的思想有了一些霉，今天，我要太阳来把我好好晒一晒。
　　又搬了一阵砖，
　　流了一阵汗，
　　有工人端着一海碗开水来叫我喝，
　　我说：这是工人阶级的酒啊，咱们来同饮同干。
　　这边活干完，
　　那边还在干，
　　我赶去，跳下坑，
　　同工人们一起打夯，
　　我唱：我要好好做工人阶级的夯，我要好好做劳动人民的砖。
