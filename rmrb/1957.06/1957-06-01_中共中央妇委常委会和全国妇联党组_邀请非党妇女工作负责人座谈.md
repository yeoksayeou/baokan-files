The CCP Central Women's Work Committee Standing Committee and the All-China Women's Federation Party Group invited non-Party members in charge of the All-China Women's Federation Standing Committee and Executive Committee, heads of women's work from various democratic parties, and heads of group members to a symposium on May 31.

Cai Chang, First Secretary of the CCP Central Women's Work Committee, said at the meeting that she hoped everyone would offer criticisms and opinions on the errors and shortcomings in women's work without reservation or hesitation.

The following people spoke at the meeting: Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League and Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation; Lao Junzhan, Standing Committee Member of the Jiu San Society Central Committee and Alternate Member of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation; Liu Qingyang, Director of the Women's Work Committee of the China Democratic League Central Committee and Secretary-General of the China Women's Friendship Association; Li Jiansheng, Head of Women's Work of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and Member of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation; Luo Shuzhang, Head of the Women's Work Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Member of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation; Liu Wang Liming, President of the China Women's Temperance Union and Standing Committee Member of the All-China Women's Federation; Tan Tiwu, Head of the Women's Work Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Member of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation; and Lei Jieqiong, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Women's Federation.

	CCP Central Women's Committee Should
		Establish a Fixed Liaison System with
		Women's Committees of Various Democratic Parties

Shi Liang spoke first, hoping that the CCP Central Women's Work Committee and the All-China Women's Federation would establish a fixed liaison system with the women's committees of various democratic parties. She suggested that the Central Women's Committee and the Vice Chairmen of the All-China Women's Federation, and the Women's Work Committees of various democratic parties should have more contact and communication. Shi Liang also said: The CCP Central Women's Committee should focus more on principles and policy issues, and provide leadership from the perspective of principles and policies, because this is the soul of women's work.

Regarding the issue of ensuring that women have equal political and economic status with men, Shi Liang said: From my experience in judicial work, I felt that this issue was better implemented when the Marriage Law was implemented. However, as time passed, feudal ideas of inequality against women have resurfaced. Therefore, the Central Women's Committee still needs to carefully study how to ensure that women are in fact equal to men.

In her speech, Lao Junzhan hoped that the Central Women's Committee would help them promote women's work in democratic parties. Then she talked about the difficulties female professors face in advancing in science. She said: Many female professors also want to improve themselves, but they always encounter difficulties. She believes that while women should be more responsible for their children and families, men should also be more responsible and help solve the difficulties women face in their studies.

In her speech, Liu Qingyang first raised the issue of the Central Women's Committee's leadership over the women's work committees of democratic parties. She said: We feel very confused about how to do women's work in democratic parties. In the past, we asked for leadership from the All-China Women's Federation, but the All-China Women's Federation really cannot lead the work of democratic parties. It is still necessary for the Party Central Women's Committee to lead.
		Strengthen Education for Children,
			Do Not Spoil Them Excessively

Liu Qingyang also talked about the issue of children's enrollment and education. She said: Many children have hooliganism and theft behaviors. Some are children of working people, and some are children of cadres. She believes that this is mainly due to insufficient education for children. She asked the All-China Women's Federation to call on women across the country to strengthen education for children at the Women's Congress and not let children wander the streets. When talking about this issue, Liu Qingyang specifically mentioned the education of cadres' children. She said: Some cadres, especially high-ranking cadres, spoil their children excessively and disrespect teachers. Some even scold teachers in front of their children, making teachers afraid to educate the children.
		The All-China Women's Federation's
			Scope of Unity is Not Broad Enough

In her speech, Li Jiansheng also asked the CCP Central Women's Work Committee to strengthen leadership over the women's work of democratic parties and include the women's work of democratic parties in the work plan. At the same time, she hoped to establish a system for regular contact and exchange of opinions.

Li Jiansheng also believes that the All-China Women's Federation's scope of unity is not broad enough. For example, in the Chinese Nursing Association and the Midwives Association, the vast majority are women. The All-China Women's Federation only paid attention to taking care of them when selecting representatives, but rarely contacted them at other times. It should often talk to them and help them solve some problems. In addition, Li Jiansheng hopes that "Chinese Women" will expand its coverage, not only to publicize the principles and policies of women's work, but also to publicize the nature, tasks, and activities of women's work in some democratic parties.

Luo Shuzhang also asked the Party Central Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation Party Group to get in touch with the women's work of democratic parties. At the same time, she suggested that the All-China Women's Federation should make good use of the strength of bourgeois housewives in urban work. She said that there are many intellectuals among bourgeois housewives. There are about a thousand people just among the members and family members of the China Democratic National Construction Association. If these people are well mobilized, they can do a lot of things. Now the education of children's enrollment and moral character is a big problem. In some collective dormitories, when parents go to work, no one takes care of the children. They steal, act like hooligans, smash doors and windows, and even organize small groups. If intellectual women are organized, the problem of child supervision can be solved.

Luo Shuzhang also said that there are still many bad people in society who rape young girls, and some of our judicial organs are not serious enough in handling these problems, and the sentences are very light. She hopes that the Chinese People's Committee for the Protection of Children will not only take care of the problem of children being well-fed and clothed, but also pay attention to protecting children's minds from being destroyed.

Liu Wang Liming believes that the All-China Women's Federation does not pay enough attention to non-Party women's organizations and upper-middle-class women. She said that upper-middle-class women have both knowledge, ability, and money, and can be well organized to do work. She said that the China Women's Temperance Union is a group of these women. A few years ago, we sent people to South China to reorganize our branches. When we contacted the local women's federations, they not only did not help, but said that this group was not needed, which made our people very sad.

Tan Tiwu raised four points of opinions to the Party Central Women's Committee and the All-China Women's Federation.

First, the All-China Women's Federation has not paid attention to giving full play to the strength of the executive committee members. She said that after I was elected as this executive committee member, I only attended a few meetings and did no work. Since we are elected, we should exert our strength and do some work appropriately.

Second, I hope that the Party Central Women's Committee will establish regular contact with the women's work committees of democratic parties and tell us how to work.

Third, there are still many obstacles to women's work, and the social idea of ​​underestimating women still exists. We cannot rely on a few people to do women's work well. We must rely on and mobilize the vast number of women to do women's work well.

Fourth, the Women's Committee should pay equal attention to the care and use of women. Although it has taken care of the selection of representatives in the past, it has not been used enough. It has not assigned tasks and asked her to do a good job and exert her strength.
		The All-China Women's Federation Should
			Pay More Attention to Women's Immediate Interests

Lei Jieqiong was the last to speak at today's meeting. She believes that the All-China Women's Federation does not pay enough attention to issues related to the immediate interests of the vast number of women. For example, is the issue of induced abortion a matter of immediate interest to women? Has the All-China Women's Federation consulted experts on this? Now the Ministry of Health has issued instructions to not restrict induced abortion. Many gynecological experts and doctors do not agree with this. This is very bad. Should we believe a few people, or should we believe experts? I think contraception should be supported, but induced abortion is a scientific issue. We should believe in science and respect experts.

Then, Lei Jieqiong criticized the All-China Women's Federation for not being strong enough in fighting certain acts of persecution and abuse of women, and for not caring about women's suffering. She said that in Xuzhou, a cadre injured his wife with nitric acid. Has the All-China Women's Federation expressed its attitude towards this brutal act? Why doesn't our newspaper publish it? We should also fight against acts of rape and abuse of women. The All-China Women's Federation should also speak out if some cases constituting criminal offenses are sentenced lightly. Although "Chinese Women" has launched a critical discussion on the issue of cadres' bigamy, the All-China Women's Federation has not expressed a principled attitude.

    中共中央妇委常委会和全国妇联党组
    邀请非党妇女工作负责人座谈
    本报讯　中共中央妇女工作委员会常务委员会和中华全国民主妇联党组于5月31日邀请全国妇联非党常委、执委，各民主党派妇女工作的负责人及团体会员的负责人，进行座谈。
    中共中央妇女工作委员会第一书记蔡畅在会上说，希望大家毫不客气、毫无顾虑地对妇女工作中的错误和缺点提出批评和意见。
    在会议上发言的有：中国民主同盟副主席、全国妇联副主席史良，九三学社中央常务委员、全国妇联候补执行委员劳君展，中国民主同盟中央妇女工作委员会主任委员、中国妇女联谊会秘书长刘清扬，中国农工民主党妇女工作负责人、全国妇联执行委员李健生，民主建国会妇女工作委员会负责人、全国妇联执行委员罗叔章，中华妇女节制会总会会长、全国妇联常务委员刘王立明，中国国民党革命委员会妇女工作委员会负责人、全国妇联执行委员谭惕吾，全国妇联常务委员雷洁琼。中共中央妇委应和各民主党派妇女委员会
          建立固定联系制度
    史良首先发言，她希望中共中央妇女工作委员会和全国妇联、各民主党派妇女委员会建立固定的联系制度。她建议中央妇委和全国妇联副主席、各民主党派妇女工作委员会多多接触，多多联系。史良还说：中共中央妇委应该多抓方针、政策问题，从方针、政策上进行领导，因为这是妇女工作的灵魂。
    关于保障妇女在政治上、经济上和男子处于平等地位的问题，史良说：这一问题我从司法工作方面感到在贯彻婚姻法时较好，但是，时过境迁，对妇女不平等的封建思想又暴露出来了，因此，如何保证妇女在事实上和男子处于平等的地位，中央妇委仍需好好研究。
    劳君展在发言中希望中央妇委帮助她们推动民主党派的妇女工作。接着她谈到女教授向科学进军的困难，她说：很多女教授也想提高自己，但总是有困难，她认为：妇女固然应该对孩子对家庭多负责任，但是男同志也应多负责，解决妇女学习中的困难。
    刘清扬在发言中，首先提出了中央妇委对民主党派妇女工作委员会的领导问题，她说：民主党派的妇女工作如何做，我们很感茫然，过去曾要求妇联领导，但是，妇联确实不能领导民主党派工作，还是需要党中央妇委来领导。加强对孩子的教育，不要过分宠爱孩子
    刘清扬还谈到孩子升学问题，对孩子的教育问题，她说：有许多孩子有流氓、偷盗行为，有些是劳动人民子女，有些是干部子女，她认为这主要是对孩子教育不够，她要求全国妇联在妇代大会上号召全国妇女加强对孩子的教育，别让孩子流浪街头。谈到这个问题的时候，刘清扬特别提到干部子弟的教育问题，她说：有些干部，特别是高级干部对孩子宠爱过分，对老师不尊重，有人甚至当着孩子的面骂教师，弄得教师不敢教育孩子。全国妇联团结的面还不够广
    李健生在发言中，也要求中共中央妇女工作委员会对民主党派的妇女工作加强领导，把民主党派的妇女工作也列入工作计划之内。同时希望能建立起经常联系、交换意见的制度。
    李健生还认为全国妇联团结的面不够广，比如中华医学会护士协会、助产士协会中，绝大多数都是妇女，全国妇联只是在选代表时注意了照顾她们，但平时则很少联系，应该经常找她们谈谈，帮助她们解决些问题。另外，李健生希望“中国妇女”扩大报道范围，不但要宣传妇女工作的方针政策，也要宣传一些民主党派妇女工作的性质、任务和活动。
    罗叔章也要求党中央妇委和妇联党组同民主党派妇女工作挂上钩。同时建议妇联在城市工作中要很好地运用资产阶级家庭妇女的力量。她说，资产阶级家庭妇女中知识分子很多，光是民建会员和家属就有一千人左右，这些人如果很好地动员起来，可以做不少事。现在儿童的升学和品德教育是个大问题，有的集体宿舍，父母上班去了，孩子们没人管教，偷窃、耍流氓、砸门窗，甚至组织小团体等等，如果把知识妇女组织起来，就可解决孩子的管教问题。
    罗叔章还谈到现在社会上强奸幼女的坏人还不少，而我们的某些司法机关处理这些问题不够严肃，判刑很轻，她希望中国人民保卫儿童委员会，不要光管孩子吃饱穿暖的问题，还要注意保护儿童的心灵不要受到摧残。
    刘王立明认为妇联对非党的妇女组织和中上层妇女重视不够。她说，中上层妇女既有知识、能力，又有钱，可以很好地组织起来做工作。她说，中华妇女节制会就是这些妇女的团体，前几年我们派人到华南去改组我们的分会，和当地的妇联联系，她们不但不帮助，反说不需要这个团体，使我们的人很难过。
    谭惕吾对党中央妇委和全国妇联提了四点意见。
    第一、妇联没有注意发挥执行委员的力量。她说，我这个执委选出后只开了几次会，什么工作也没做。既然选出，就应该发挥力量，适当做些工作。
    第二、希望党中央妇委同民主党派妇女工作委员会建立经常联系，告诉我们如何工作。
    第三、妇女工作的障碍还很多，社会上轻视妇女的思想还存在，不能依靠少数人做好妇女工作，必须依靠、动员广大妇女做好妇女工作。
    第四、妇委应对妇女群众关心和使用并重。过去虽然在选代表时很照顾，很关心，但是使用不够，没有交代任务，叫她做好工作，发挥一份力量。妇联应多关心妇女的切身利益
    雷洁琼在今天的会上最后发言，她认为妇联对有关广大妇女切身的利益问题不够关心。比如人工流产问题是一个有关妇女切身利益的问题，妇联有没有找专家研究过？现在卫生部发出了对人工流产不加限制的指示，许多妇科专家和医生都不赞成，这样做很不好。究竟是相信几个人的话呢，还是相信专家？我觉得避孕应该赞成，但人工流产是科学问题，应该相信科学，尊重专家。
  接着，雷洁琼批评妇联在对待某些迫害、摧残妇女的行为，斗争性不强，不关心妇女疾苦。她说，徐州有个干部用硝镪水伤害了自己的妻子，对这种残暴的行为，妇联表示了态度没有？我们的报纸为什么不登？对于强奸妇女、虐待妇女的行为也应该进行斗争，有些构成刑事犯罪的案件判轻了的妇联也应该说话。干部重婚的问题，虽然“中国妇女”发起过批判讨论，但妇联并没有表示原则性的态度。
