Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai today sent a telegram to President Nasser of the Republic of Egypt, congratulating him on the National Day of the Republic of Egypt. The telegram reads as follows:

    To His Excellency Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the Republic of Egypt:
    On the occasion of the National Day of the Republic of Egypt, I extend my warm congratulations to Your Excellency and the Government of the Republic of Egypt.
    In the past year, the government and people of the Republic of Egypt have achieved great victories in defending the independence and freedom of their motherland, resisting aggression, and opposing colonialism. This victory demonstrates the fighting will of the Egyptian people and the Arab people, and also shows the united strength of the awakened Asian and African people in the anti-colonialist struggle. Although imperialism is still provoking and creating divisions among Arab countries and Asian-African countries today, we firmly believe that as long as Asian-African countries and people unite as one, they will eventually defeat this conspiracy of imperialism. The Chinese government and people have been, and will continue to be, reliable friends of the Egyptian people and the Arab people in their anti-colonialist struggle. I wish Your Excellency and the Egyptian people new and greater achievements in the cause of safeguarding national independence, national freedom, and defending world peace.
        Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
        June 16, 1957, in Beijing

    新华社16日讯　中华人民共和国毛泽东主席今天致电埃及共和国总统纳赛尔，祝贺埃及共和国国庆。电文如下：埃及共和国加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统阁下：
    当埃及共和国国庆的时候，我谨代表中国人民并且以我个人的名义向阁下和伟大的埃及人民致以诚挚的祝贺。祝中埃两国之间的友谊和合作日益巩固和发展。祝阁下和埃及人民在谋求埃及共和国繁荣富强的事业中获得新的成就。

    新华社16日讯　周恩来总理今天致电埃及共和国总统纳赛尔，祝贺埃及共和国国庆。电文如下：埃及共和国加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统阁下：
    当埃及共和国国庆的时候，我谨向阁下和埃及共和国政府致以热烈的祝贺。
    一年以来，埃及共和国政府和人民在保卫祖国的独立和自由，反抗侵略和反对殖民主义的斗争中，获得了巨大的胜利。这一胜利显示了埃及人民和阿拉伯人民的斗争意志，也显示了已经觉醒的亚非人民在反殖民主义斗争中的团结力量。尽管帝国主义今天仍在阿拉伯国家之间和亚非国家之间进行挑拨，制造分裂，但是我们深信，只要亚非国家和人民团结一致，就一定会最终地击破帝国主义的这一阴谋。中国政府和人民过去一向是，今后仍然是埃及人民和阿拉伯人民反殖民主义斗争中的可靠朋友。我预祝阁下和埃及人民在维护国家独立、民族自由和保卫世界和平的事业中获得新的更大的成就。
        中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
