　　Home Inside and Out
　　Cui Zhizai
    After my husband and I got married, the family was very poor, with no property at all, and we relied entirely on our labor to maintain our lives. In the old society, like all working people, we had work to do, suffering to endure, but no food to eat and no clothes to wear. After liberation, my husband joined the workforce, became a cadre, and had a fixed monthly income, and our lives were guaranteed. I also often participated in various community activities, and my awareness gradually increased. In 1951, I started doing street work, successively serving as a newspaper reader, reading group leader, production team leader, part-time school teacher, vice principal, and principal. For the past five or six years, I have consistently insisted on part-time education work, which has been supported by the masses and praised by the leaders. I have been named an activist in eliminating illiteracy, a model teacher, and an advanced worker. The part-time school has also been named a model unit three times. More than two hundred people have officially received elementary school graduation certificates from this school, and more than eighty people have received senior elementary school graduation certificates. These people were originally illiterate or semi-literate. The vast majority are housewives. Last year, all twenty-two graduates from the senior elementary school class found employment, some as female workers in yarn factories and some as shop assistants. As the school's achievements grow, our confidence grows, our enthusiasm is higher, and our courage to overcome difficulties is even greater. Although the teachers are all volunteering their time, everyone's desire to serve socialist construction is very enthusiastic and urgent. We all know that teaching people to read is the glorious duty of every literate person. Moreover, we believe that everyone is responsible for building socialism. The great socialist construction is formed by seemingly ordinary and small labors. Therefore, I feel very honored and happy to be able to contribute a little to the construction of socialism and serve the masses in various different positions.
    Now I will briefly talk about my experience in part-time education work for more than five years.

　　Reading Newspapers and Running Schools for Five Years
    Soon after the liberation of Zhengzhou, reading groups were organized on the streets. Because I had attended elementary school before the age of twelve, street cadres asked me to serve as a newspaper reader. While reading the newspaper, I patiently explained it to everyone, combining it with the women's thoughts. In the process, the masses increased their knowledge, and I also improved myself.
    In 1951, the government called for the organization of part-time cultural schools for the working masses. I, along with street cadres and representatives, studied the organization of part-time cultural schools. Every day, I not only publicized and mobilized women to learn culture in the reading group, but also carried my child around to mobilize women to learn culture. I promoted the pain of illiteracy to them. Later, with everyone's efforts and the government's support, the part-time school was established. There were two classes of students with a total of eighty people. At that time, I was asked to be a teacher. I was afraid that I would not do well, so I went to class with a try-it-out attitude. After two days, my voice became hoarse, and I couldn't even speak. I wavered in my mind and didn't want to do it. But then I thought, it is not easy for women to come to class with their children; moreover, there will be difficulties in any work, and without overcoming difficulties, there is no way to do the work well. So I mustered up the courage to do it. When the school first started, teachers left one after another, leaving only myself. I thought, if this person doesn't do it, and that person doesn't do it, who will do it? I want to persevere. So, I ran to this end of the street to teach Chinese, and then ran to the other end to teach arithmetic. One person's strength was not enough, so I went to find teachers. However, some educated people were unwilling and made sarcastic remarks: "We have many children and backward ideas. How can we compare with you activists?" I was still not discouraged and continued to look until I found them. The teachers were found. A new problem arose. A teacher, Ms. Jia, did not teach according to the stroke order. I gave her my opinion, and she was not satisfied. Instead, she proposed to quit. At this time, I was discouraged and didn't want to do it at all. The people in the same courtyard persuaded me, and the students also persuaded me, "Are you serving us? Or are you serving her?" I thought carefully, yes, I am serving the masses. I want to listen to the masses and discuss with them. I mustered up the courage to continue. Starting from doing a good job, I exchanged opinions with the teachers individually. Later, everyone studied together when something happened. We eliminated misunderstandings, strengthened unity, and improved teaching ability.
    In 1953, the school expanded to six classes, and the number of teachers also increased. At this time, the district cultural and educational section asked me to serve as the vice principal. At that time, some people said, "Can she be the principal?" I myself was also afraid that I would not do well, but when I thought of the masses' urgent desire to learn culture, I had confidence. I often saw street activists lose something when conveying instructions from higher authorities because they were uneducated, and the work suffered losses. Thinking of this, I was not discouraged. I relied on the masses, and the work achieved results, and I gained the support of the masses. In 1955, I also served as the principal.

    Although I Have Five Children, It Has Never Affected Teaching
    Although I have five children and many trivial housework matters, I have never let children and housework affect my teaching, nor has my teaching work affected my care for employees and children. In the winter of 1956, I was also selected as a "Five-Good" activist. In the past, I taught at night and engaged in sideline production during the day to supplement the family's life. After I received a subsidy in 1956, I stopped sideline production. In addition to doing housework, I put all my energy into teaching work.
    My housework, work, and study time are arranged as follows:
    I get up at five o'clock every morning. As the saying goes, "Early to rise makes one resourceful; late to rise makes one distressed." "If you want to live well, everyone should get up early." After getting up, I first sweep the floor, wipe the table, and tidy up. Then I start cooking. During the cooking process, I use the time to read books and newspapers or look at my children's homework. After the meal is cooked, I arrange for my husband and children to eat. I then tidy up the bed and prepare to wash the pots and bowls. After breakfast, my husband goes to work, the older children go to school, and the younger three take the younger four to play. If it is on Monday, Wednesday, or Saturday mornings, I take my youngest daughter to the homes of the teachers in the street study group to see how they are preparing for the afternoon classes. I go home around ten o'clock. If I am not steaming buns, I do some needlework. At eleven o'clock, I start making lunch. After lunch is cooked, my husband and children come back. I arrange for them to eat. At this time, the older children and the second child will take care of the younger siblings. One-thirty in the afternoon on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays is the time for the street study group to study. After I finish eating and washing up, I take my child deep into the study group to understand the students' learning situation and the teachers' teaching situation. Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings are my time to do housework, sewing, mending, washing, etc. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons, I take my child and visit the students of the part-time school, understand the reasons for absenteeism, and help them find solutions. Under normal circumstances, my time is arranged like this. If there are meetings I need to attend, I still attend the meetings and do less housework.

    Fourteen Years of Loving Life After Marriage
    Every day at five o'clock in the afternoon, I start making dinner. While making dinner, I also do some odd jobs (such as sewing sock bottoms, shoe soles, mending children's torn clothes, etc.). Generally, large jobs such as dismantling and washing cotton clothes are done during holidays. After dinner is cooked, if my husband has not returned, I will prepare the meal and put it aside. On the one hand, I arrange for the children to eat. After eating and washing up, I arrange everything at home to my nine-year-old second son, who watches the door and plays with the younger three and younger four. The older children go to school for evening self-study, and I take the younger five to the part-time school. School starts at seven-thirty in the evening. I always arrive at school at seven o'clock, put the child in the stroller, and start cleaning the office, preparing boiling water, teaching aids, etc. Because the teachers are all doing temporary work, selling vegetables, etc. They have worked all day and run from far away to teach class. It is tiring enough. They cannot be allowed to do these preparatory work again. After the teachers start class, because I don't have a class to teach, I take this time to study on my own, reading relevant educational documents or books and newspapers. Class ends at nine-thirty. The school affairs committee members have a small meeting together to study the work and solve problems at any time. As usual, we fill out the daily inspection form, recording students' attendance, homework, hygiene, etc. After ten o'clock, I end the day's work.
    On Sundays, our whole family often goes to the park or the street to play, or takes the older children to see a movie. My husband and I have been married for fourteen years now, and we have never quarreled. We always help each other, plan our lives frugally, and educate our children together. Our life is very happy.

    Run More Part-Time Education to Meet the Needs of the Masses
    In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, the government, the trade union, and the women's federation, my awareness has improved day by day, and my confidence in serving the people has also increased day by day. I am not afraid of difficulties, and I am used to a busy life. When I see a housewife who was illiterate is able to read newspapers and write letters, I am unspeakably happy. I have shared their joy, and I love my work even more. From the current point of view, I feel that doing a good job in part-time education has greater practical significance. In the future, our country will have more middle and elementary school graduates who cannot go to school and engage in labor. However, the parents' and children's enthusiastic demands for learning culture have not stopped because of graduation. If our workers' families use their spare time to help the masses organize more part-time schools, study classes, and study groups, it will meet the cultural needs of some women and children. This is also beneficial to helping the government solve internal contradictions among the people. We have written a plan and submitted it to the district government, preparing to add two junior high school classes to the part-time school to meet the needs of more people. (Attached image)

　　家庭内外
　　崔之栽
    我和丈夫结婚后，家庭很贫穷，没有任何财产，完全靠我们双手劳动维持生活。在旧社会里，我们和所有的劳动人民一样，有做的活，受的罪，没有吃的饭，穿的衣。解放后，丈夫参加了工作，当了干部，每月有了固定收入，生活也有了保障，我也经常参加街道各种社会活动，觉悟逐渐提高。1951年我就开始搞街道工作，先后担任了读报员，读报组长，生产组长、业余学校教师、副校长、校长等工作。五、六年来，我一贯坚持业余教育工作，受到了群众的拥护和上级的表扬，曾被评为扫盲积极分子、模范教师和先进工作者。业余学校也曾三次评为模范单位。从这个学校正式拿到初小毕业证书的已经有二百多人，拿到高小毕业证书的八十多个人。这些人原来都是文盲或半文盲。绝大多数是家庭妇女。去年毕业的一班高小学生，二十二人都就了业，有的是纱厂女工，有的是商店营业员。学校的成绩越来越大，我们的信心更大，热情更高，克服困难的勇气也更足。老师们虽然都是尽义务，但大家为社会主义建设服务的愿望都非常热烈和迫切。我们都知道，教人识字是每个识字人应尽的光荣义务。而且，我们认为，建设社会主义人人有责。伟大的社会主义建设是由看来是平凡的、渺小的劳动汇集而成的。因此，我能在各种不同的岗位上为建设社会主义贡献一点力量，为群众服点务，就感到非常光荣和愉快。
    现在我简单的谈一下五年多来从事业余教育工作的情况。
　　五年如一日读报又办学
    郑州市解放不久，街道上就组织了读报组，因为我在十二岁以前念过小学，街道干部就叫我担任读报员。读报时，我结合妇女的思想，耐心地给大家解释。在这中间，群众增多了知识，也提高了我自己。
    1951年政府号召组织劳动群众业余文化学校，我和街道干部、代表们在一块研究组织业余文化学校。我每天不但在读报组里宣传动员妇女学文化，还抱着孩子串门子动员妇女学文化。给她们宣传不识字的痛苦。后来在大家的努力和政府的支持下，业余学校成立了。有两班学生共八十人。当时叫我担任教师，我怕搞不好，抱着试试看的态度去上课。两天嗓子急哑了，连话也说不出来，思想上动摇了，不愿干。可是又一想，妇女们带着孩子来上课是不容易的；再者，什么工作都会有困难，不克服困难就没法把工作搞好。于是我鼓起勇气去干。学校刚办起来，老师纷纷离去，就剩下我自己。我想，这个不干，那个不干，谁来干呢？我要坚持干下去。于是，跑街这头上语文，又跑那头教算术。一个人的力量不够，我就去找教员。但是，有的有文化的人不愿意，说风凉话：“我们孩子多，思想落后，哪能和你们积极分子比。”我还是不灰心，再去找，直到找到为止。教员找来了。新问题又来了，有一个贾老师没有按笔划顺序教，我给她提了意见，她不满意，反而提出不干了。这时我泄了气，高低不想干了。同院群众劝我，学生也劝我，“你是为我们服务呢？还是为她服务呢？”我仔细一想，是的，我是为群众服务，我要听群众的话和群众商量，我又鼓起勇气干下去。从搞好工作出发，和教师个别交换了意见。以后，有事大家一块研究，解除了隔阂，加强了团结，提高了教学能力。
    学校在1953年又扩大到六班，教员也随着增多。这时区文教股又叫我担任副校长。当时有的人就说：“她能当校长吗？”我自己也怕搞不好，但是，一想起群众迫切要求学文化的热情，我就有信心了。我常常看见街道积极分子由于没文化，传达上级指示时丢东忘西，工作受损失，想到这里，我就不泄气了。我依靠了群众，工作取得了成绩，得到群众的拥护。1955年我又担任了校长。
    虽有五个孩子从没影响教学
    我虽然有五个孩子，有许多繁琐的家务事，但我从没有因孩子、家务影响教学，同时也没有因教学工作影响我照顾职工和孩子。1956年冬天，我还被评选为“五好”积极分子。以前我是夜间教书，白天搞副业生产，补助家庭生活。1956年我领到补助费后，就停止了副业生产，除了搞家务，我的全部精力都放在教学工作上。
    我的家务、工作、学习，时间是这样安排的：
    每天早晨五点起床，俗话说：“早起三光，晚起三慌”，“要想过得好，大家起个早”，起床后就先扫地、擦桌，整理卫生，之后就开始做饭。在做饭过程中，利用星点时间看看书报或孩子们的作业。饭做好后，就安排丈夫和孩子们吃饭。我便整理床铺，并准备着洗刷锅、碗。吃罢早饭，丈夫上班，大孩子们上学，小三带小四去玩。如果是每星期的一、三、六的上午，我就抱着小女儿到街道学习组的老师家里去一趟，看看他们下午教课问题准备的怎么样。十点钟前后我就回家了，如果不蒸馍，就做些针线活，到十一点钟，就开始做午饭，午饭做好，丈夫和孩子们都回来了，我就安排他们吃饭，这时大孩子、二孩子会照顾小弟弟们吃饭。一、三、六的下午一点半是街道学习小组学习时间，我吃罢饭洗刷完毕就抱着小孩深入到学习小组，了解学员学习情况，老师教学情况。二、四、五上午是我搞家务的时间，缝缝补补洗洗等。二、四、五下午，我就又抱着孩子以串门方式去访问业余学校的学员，了解缺课原因，帮助她想办法解决问题。在一般情况下我的时间就是这样安排，如果有会议要我参加，我仍然参加会议，少搞些家务。
    结婚十四年恩爱过日子
    每天下午五点钟，开始做晚饭。做着晚饭我也要作些零碎活（如纳袜底、鞋底、补补小孩的破衣服等），一般大件活如拆洗棉衣等，都是在假期中做。晚饭做好后，丈夫如果没有回来，我就把饭给准备好放在一边。一方面安排孩子们吃饭。吃完饭洗刷后，我把家里的一切都安排给九岁的二儿子，他看着家门，带着小三、小四玩。大孩子去学校上晚自习，我抱着小五去业余学校。学校是晚上七点半上课，每天晚上我总是七点钟到校，把孩子放在小车里，就开始收拾办公室，准备开水、教具等。因为老师们都是做临时工、卖菜等。他们劳动了一天，从很远的地方跑来上课，是够累的了。不能让他们再来作这些准备工作。老师上课后，我因没担课，就趁这个时间自学，看有关教育工作的文件或书报。九点半下课，校务委员们在一块开一个小碰头会，研究一下工作，有问题随时解决，照例的要填每日的日查表，记载学生的出勤、作业、卫生等情况。十点钟后我便结束了这一天的劳动。
    星期天，我们全家人也常常到公园里，大街上去玩玩，或者带着大孩子们去看看电影。我和丈夫结婚到现在已十四年了，没闹过气，夫妇之间总是互相帮助，勤俭计划日子，共同来教育孩子，我们的生活过得非常愉快。多办业余教育满足群众要求
    几年来，我在党和政府、工会、妇联的培养教育下，觉悟一天天提高，为人民服务的信心也一天天增强。我不怕困难，我已习惯了紧张的生活。当我亲眼看见一个不识字的家庭妇女会看报、写信了，我的心里就说不出来的高兴，我已分享了她们的快乐，我也更热爱我的工作。从目前来说，我感觉办好业余教育有更大的现实意义。今后我国将有较多的中、小学毕业生升不上学，从事劳动。但父母们、孩子们对学习文化的热烈要求并没有因毕业而停止，如果我们职工家属利用自己的业余时间，帮助群众多组织些业余学校、学习班、学习组就会满足一部分妇女、儿童学文化的要求。这对帮助政府解决人民内部矛盾也是有好处的。我们已写了计划呈报区政府了，准备在业余学校里再增加两班初中班，以便满足更多人的要求。（附图片）
