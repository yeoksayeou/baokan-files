Holding Position and Power, Intimately Close

At a meeting, Xue Yong, the capitalist vice-director of the state-private joint venture Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory, said, "As vice-director, I not only have a position and power, but also get along intimately with the state representative..."

What is the actual relationship between the public and private sides in this factory? I decided to visit and see for myself.

That day, I happened to catch Director Xue chairing a production meeting. There was a lot of debate at the meeting. The section chiefs and workshop directors, who were all formerly from the private side, expressed their opinions without any reservations. In the end, Director Xue summarized everyone's opinions and made a decision. As the meeting was about to end, Yang Guangze, the chairman of the trade union, criticized the administration for not paying enough attention to worker safety. He said, "The forgers don't have protective sleeves, and their arms are getting burned. The grinders don't have enough protective glasses either. The leadership should solve these problems quickly." Director Xue immediately accepted the criticism and instructed the supply and marketing section chief to take care of these two matters in the next few days. After the meeting, Xi Jingfan, the Party Branch Secretary, came to Director Xue to discuss convening the factory's democratic management committee and awarding bonuses. Director Xue disagreed with the Party Branch Secretary's proposed handling of the first and second quarter bonuses. After some debate, the Branch Secretary agreed to Director Xue's opinion, pending further research before making a decision.

At this point, Director Xue turned to me with a smile and said, "You can see whether I have a position and power, right?"

He continued, "It wasn't like this when we first became a joint venture. At that time, the two directors didn't have a clear division of labor. It was said that I was in charge of production, but I wasn't responsible for approving production and financial plans or for personnel transfers in the workshops. I thought to myself: since we're a joint venture, everything is the responsibility of the state director, so I can just relax and not worry about anything. So even though I clearly saw that the untimely supply of materials was causing delays, I didn't offer any suggestions. One afternoon, the state director, Zhang Buquan, said to me kindly, "I don't know much about the production technology of medical equipment, and I'm often out attending meetings. You're the expert in this area, so you should be responsible for approving production and financial plans and managing the factory's production. I'll be responsible for the factory's ideological education and other major issues. What do you think of this division of labor?" At that moment, I was shocked. He was entrusting me with the full power of production in the factory. Could Director Zhang really trust me? What worried me even more was that if I took on this responsibility and something went wrong, I would be punished. So I said, "I used to be the director of a small factory with a dozen or so workers. Now it's a big factory with more than a hundred people, with monthly production expenses of twenty or thirty thousand yuan. If there's a deviation in management, the responsibility will be great." Before I could finish speaking, Director Zhang continued, "Just take charge boldly. If there are deviations due to lack of experience, we'll correct them together. I'm the director, so of course I have to oversee production. If responsibility is to be investigated, my responsibility is even greater than yours, so don't have any concerns." Seeing Director Zhang's sincere encouragement, I boldly took on the responsibility for the factory's production.

At this point, Director Xue said happily, "Director Zhang not only encouraged me to take responsibility, but also created the conditions for me to take responsibility boldly. In addition to regularly conducting united front policy education among workers and cadres, asking them to respect my leadership, Director Zhang also specifically helped me learn how to manage a business. In the private sector, I never held production meetings; I just made the decisions myself. Director Zhang, on the other hand, had been a workshop director and acting director in a state-owned factory, and he had experience in the management methods of state-owned enterprises. After I accepted this task, he first chaired several production meetings for me to observe, and then had me chair them. When we encountered difficult problems, we discussed solutions beforehand, and he helped supplement what I didn't cover comprehensively at the meeting, and then helped me summarize the shortcomings of the meeting afterward. Thanks to Director Zhang's specific assistance, I quickly mastered this set of management methods. Only by having the ability to manage production can I truly have a position and power. Otherwise, having power without ability is just empty talk."

"Although Director Zhang and I have a division of labor, Director Zhang still often consults me on other matters in the factory. During the wage reform last year, Director Zhang proposed that I be the director of the factory's wage reform committee, and many of my opinions on wage assessment were adopted. One of the former private sector employees, based on his technical level, should have been rated as a Grade Four worker. But because he hadn't participated in production for a long time in the private sector, and his participation in production after the joint venture seemed less skilled, everyone rated him as a Grade Three worker. I opposed this opinion, and after some debate, everyone agreed to change him to a Grade Four worker. I wasn't always this bold in expressing my opinions. In the early days of the joint venture, I was also worried and didn't dare to speak out. Later, I made some suggestions that were supported by Director Zhang, and my concerns gradually disappeared. As a result, the more Director Zhang supported me and trusted me, the more frankly I dared to offer all kinds of criticisms and suggestions to Director Zhang. My suggestions for trial-producing new products, improving tools, and adjusting the strength of departments have all been supported by Director Zhang and realized. Of course, sometimes my opinions are not very correct. For example, last year there were too many management cadres in our factory. I just wanted to push the surplus cadres to the higher authorities for redistribution. Who knew that the Beijing Medical Equipment Company not only didn't help the factory solve this problem, but instead sent a cadre from the company to the factory. I was very opposed to the company's approach at the time, but Director Zhang's opinion was different from mine. He believed that cadres should be assigned to workshops for production as much as possible, based on each cadre's situation. This would not only increase production strength, but also avoid adding difficulties to the higher authorities. Director Zhang talked to me many times, and I reluctantly agreed. Now, the cadres who have been assigned to workshops to participate in production have become skilled workers, and I am completely convinced of Director Zhang's foresight.

"Being able to cooperate well in work alone cannot truly eliminate ideological barriers. Director Zhang and I also get along well in terms of ideological feelings and life." He pointed to the three south-facing factory buildings and said: "Originally, we both worked and slept in that room. It was only when the houses were readjusted this year that we separated and lived in these two small west-facing houses. In the past, when we lived together, we often talked until midnight. You could say that we talked about everything. We talked about factory matters, about family, children and personal experiences. Director Zhang talked about his Long March experience in the Red Army, which was very educational for me. Usually, when someone criticizes someone's shortcomings, or someone treats someone to a meal, there is never any concern that you are a public official and a party member, and I am from the private sector, always being wary."

He said, "I don't agree with removing state representatives. Take our factory for example. Without Director Zhang, there's no way I could lead this factory. Not to mention anything else, just the ideological education of workers and cadres, I couldn't do it. In the third quarter of last year, imported grinding wheels and steel files couldn't be bought on the market, and the workers insisted that imported tools were necessary to ensure product quality. In the past, when it was a private enterprise, if the capitalists didn't buy imported tools, the workers would make trouble and refuse to work. Now, after Director Zhang helped to carry out ideological education, the workers not only stopped insisting on imported goods, but also used scrap steel rods to make more than a hundred steel files every month, and the product quality was also guaranteed. Without Director Zhang's help, my opinion would be difficult to get the workers' support."

    有职有权，亲密无间
    本报记者　陈一超
    公私合营五华医疗器械厂的资方副厂长薛涌，在一次会议上说：“我这个副厂长，不但有职有权，而且和公方代表相处得亲密无间……”
    这个厂的公私关系究竟是怎样的呢？我决定去访问一下，亲自看一看。
    那天，正遇着薛厂长在主持生产会议。在会上，大家争论很多，参加会议的由资方人员担任的科长和车间主任，都毫无顾虑地发表自己的意见，最后，薛厂长把大家的意见归纳起来作出了决定。快要散会时，工会主席杨光泽对行政不够重视工人的安全提出了批评，他说：“锻工没有护袖，手臂都烫伤了，磨工的保护眼镜也不够用，领导上应该赶快解决。”薛厂长马上接受了这个批评，并指示供销科科长要在最近几天把这两件事办好。会后，党支部书记席经蕃来找薛厂长商量召开工厂民主管理委员会和评发奖金的事情，薛厂长不同意党支部书记提出的对一、二季度奖金的处理意见，经过一番争论后，支部书记同意薛厂长的意见，等待多方面研究后再作决定。
    这时，薛厂长转过身来笑着对我说：“你可以看出来我是不是有职有权了吧？”
    他接着说：“刚合营时，可不是这样。那时两个厂长分工不明确，说是让我管生产，可是生产财务计划的审批和车间的人事调动都不用我管。我心里也想：合营了，事事都由公方厂长负责，我可以万事大吉不用管了，所以明明看到材料供应不及时发生窝工，也不提意见。有一天下午，公方厂长张步全亲切地对我说：“我对医疗器械的生产技术不大懂，又常出去开会，而你是这方面的内行，那你就负责审批生产财务计划和管理全厂的生产，我来负责全厂的思想教育工作和其他方面的重大问题。你觉得这样分工怎样？”当时我心里一惊，全厂的生产大权都交我来掌握，你张厂长能放心吗？更担心的是挑起这个担子以后，出了问题要受处分。因此，我就说：“我过去是十几个工人的小厂长，现在是一百多人的大工厂，每月有两、三万元的生产开支，万一在管理上出了偏差，这责任就大了。”不等我把话说完，张厂长就接着说：“你只管放心大胆地去负责，如果是因为没有经验出了偏差，我们共同来纠正，我是正厂长，我对生产当然要过问，要是追查责任的话，我比你的责任更大，你不要有顾虑。”看张厂长这样诚心真意地鼓励我，我就大胆地把全厂的生产责任担负了起来。
    谈到这里，薛厂长高兴地说：“张厂长不但放手鼓励我去负责，并且给我创造大胆负责的条件。张厂长除了经常在工人、干部中间进行统战政策教育，要他们尊重我的领导外，还具体帮助我学会管理企业的方法。我在私营时期，从没开过生产会议，都是我说了算。而张厂长在国营工厂当过车间主任和代理厂长，国营企业的经营管理方法他是有经验的。我接受了这个任务后，他就先主持几次生产会议让我看，然后来让我主持。碰到困难的问题，我们都在会前商量好解决办法，会上他又帮助补充我讲得不全面的地方，会后还帮助我总结会议的缺点。由于张厂长这样具体的帮助，我很快地就掌握了这套管理方法。有了管理生产的本领，我才能真正作到了有职有权，否则，光有权没能耐，也是一句空话。
    “我同张厂长虽然有分工，但是厂里其他事情，张厂长还是常来征求我的意见。去年工资改革时，张厂长提议我当厂里工资改革委员会的主任，我对评工资的很多意见都被采纳了。有一个私方人员，按技术水平来说，应该评为四级工。但因为他在私营时长期没有参加生产，合营后参加生产显得不够熟练，因此，大家就评他为三级工。我反对这个意见，经过争论，后来大家同意把他改成了四级工。我并不是一开始就这样大胆提意见的，在合营初期，也是顾虑多，有意见不敢说出来。后来我提了一些建议，得到张厂长的支持，我的顾虑才渐渐消除了。这样一来，张厂长越支持我，信任我，我就越敢坦率地向张厂长提出各式各样的批评和建议。我提出试制新产品、改进工具、调整科室力量等建议，都得到张厂长的支持而实现了。当然，我有时提的意见不大正确。例如，去年我们厂里管理干部多，我只想把多余的干部推给上级去重新分配，谁知道北京市医疗器械公司不但没有帮助厂里解决这个问题，反而把公司的一个干部派到了厂里来。我当时非常反对公司的做法，而张厂长的意见却和我不同。他认为应该根据每个干部的情况，尽可能分配到车间去参加生产，这样既可以增加生产力量，又免得给上级增加困难。张厂长和我多次交谈，我勉强同意了。现在，分配到车间去参加生产的干部，成了技术工人，我完全信服了张厂长的远见。
    “光在工作上能合作得好，并不能真正消除思想上的隔阂。我和张厂长在思想感情上、生活上，也同样相处得来。”他指着朝南的三间厂房说：原来我们两个都在那个房里办公，也在那里睡觉，今年调整房子时，我们俩才分开住在这两间西晒的小房子里。过去我们住在一起时，经常谈天到半夜，可以说是无话不谈。谈工厂的事情，谈家庭、孩子和个人的经历。张厂长谈他在红军时的长征经历，对我教育很大。在平时谁批评谁的缺点，或谁请谁吃顿饭时，从来没有顾虑到你是公方、党员，我是私方，处处存戒心。”
    他说：“我不同意撤除公方代表。拿我们工厂来说，如果没有张厂长，说什么我也领导不了这个厂，不说别的，光说工人和干部的思想教育工作，我就作不了。去年三季度，市场上买不到进口货的沙轮和钢锉，而工人强调非用进口工具不能保证产品质量。过去私营时，资本家不买进口工具，工人就闹着不愿干活，现在，经过张厂长帮助进行了思想教育，工人不但没有再强调要进口货，反而利用废钢棍每月自己动手做一百多把钢锉，产品质量也保证了。如果没有张厂长的帮助，我的意见是很难得到工人支持的。”
