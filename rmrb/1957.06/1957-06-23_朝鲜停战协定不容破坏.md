　　The Korean Armistice Agreement Must Not Be Violated

　　The U.S. Department of Defense and the senior U.S. member of the Korean Military Armistice Commission brazenly announced on the 21st that they would violate Article II, Paragraph 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement and transport new weapons into South Korea. Major General Zheng Guolu, senior member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, has lodged the strongest protest with the U.S. side for this. The Chinese people fully support this protest.

　　The U.S. action to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement has been premeditated for a long time. In fact, from the moment the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, when the ink was barely dry, the United States, which had suffered a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea but was unwilling to accept it, has constantly violated the Armistice Agreement. On August 8, 1953, less than two weeks after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the United States signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group, announcing that it would continue to prepare for war. Since then, the United States has actively expanded the Syngman Rhee group's army and smuggled various weapons and equipment from outside Korea. To legalize this violation of the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side repeatedly suggested altering Article II, Paragraph 13 of the Armistice Agreement in September and October 1953, demanding that parts and disassembled components of aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition should not be subject to the restrictions of this article when transported into Korea. At that time, the U.S. side also repeatedly suggested that the combat aircraft stipulated in this article should not include aircraft equipped with certain devices that could be readily equipped with destructive weapons. The Korean-Chinese side issued a communique on October 3, 1953, exposing and refuting this absurd claim by the U.S. side.

　　Subsequently, on October 12 of the same year, the U.S. side accused the Korean-Chinese side of shipping combat aircraft in crates, attempting to create a pretext for realizing its unreasonable demands. However, the results of on-site investigations by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's mobile inspection teams proved that the U.S. accusations were completely fabricated.

　　After this, the U.S. side's usual trick to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement was to constantly transport large quantities of weapons and equipment into Korea while slandering the Korean-Chinese side for violating the Armistice Agreement. However, this trick did not escape the eyes of the people. The approved draft of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's consolidated report on the rotation and replacement of personnel on both sides in October and November 1953 confirmed that the Korean-Chinese side had not violated the Armistice Agreement, while the United States had transported a large number of reinforcing military supplies from outside the country. The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission later submitted a "Report on Military Reinforcements Entering Korea by the United Nations Command in Violation of the Armistice Agreement from July 27, 1953 to April 15, 1954." The existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission had become a serious obstacle on the road of the U.S. side's arbitrary violation of the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, the U.S. side regarded the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as a thorn in its side, instigated the Syngman Rhee group to obstruct the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and finally forced it to stop its work in South Korea. The facts are very clear: it is not others, but the U.S. side that has consistently violated the Armistice Agreement.

　　The United States is now openly announcing the cancellation of Article II, Paragraph 13, in order to transport so-called "new weapons" into Korea, which is inseparable from its conspiracy to create tension in Asia. In the strategic plans of the U.S. aggressor clique, southern Korea, China's Taiwan, and southern Vietnam have always been the three fronts and three important bases for U.S. aggression against China. Due to the recent rise of anti-American sentiment among the people of Asian countries and the failure of the U.S. policy towards China, the U.S. ruling clique has become alarmed. They are afraid that the situation in Asia will further ease, so they are trying every means to tighten their control over these three military bases and create tension in these three regions in order to prevent the easing of the situation in Asia. The U.S. action to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement is another step taken after the U.S. talks with Ngo Dinh Diem and the deployment of missile units in Taiwan.

　　The Armistice Agreement, like any international agreement, is a whole. The violation of some clauses will inevitably affect the implementation of other clauses, thereby making the agreement lose its integrity and effectiveness. Moreover, since the United States can unilaterally abolish Article II, Paragraph 13 of the agreement today with this excuse, it can unilaterally abolish other clauses with other excuses tomorrow. The Syngman Rhee group has already clamored to take this opportunity to tear up the Armistice Agreement, which is proof of this. The U.S. aggressor clique must be warned: This action of the United States to unilaterally cancel the Armistice Agreement poses a serious threat to the stability of the Korean Armistice and to peace in Asia. This is something that the Korean-Chinese side and peace-loving people all over the world can never allow. The United States must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. At the same time, other countries on the United Nations Command side that allow the United States to do so cannot escape their due responsibility. The Korean-Chinese side will wage a resolute struggle to safeguard the Armistice Agreement and to oppose the illegal destructive actions of the United States.

### 朝鲜停战协定不容破坏

　　朝鲜停战协定不容破坏
    美国国防部和朝鲜军事停战委员会美方首席委员，在21日公然宣布要破坏朝鲜停战协定的第二条第十三款，向南朝鲜运入新武器。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将已经为此向美方提出了最强硬的抗议。中国人民完全支持这个抗议。
    美国这一破坏朝鲜停战协定的行动，蓄谋已久。事实上，从朝鲜停战协定刚刚签订、墨迹未干的时候起，在侵略朝鲜战争中遭受惨败而又不肯甘心的美国，就不断违反停战协定。1953年8月8日，也就是离开停战协定签订还不到两个星期，美国就同李承晚集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，宣布要继续进行战争准备。在这以后，美国就积极扩充李承晚集团的军队，从朝鲜境外偷运进各种武器装备。为了使这种违反停战协定的行为合法化，美方在1953年9、10月间曾经屡次建议篡改停战协定第二条第十三款，要求飞机、装甲车辆、武器弹药的零件和拆散件可以不受这一条款的约束而运入朝鲜。美方当时又屡次建议，这一条款所规定的作战飞机，不应包括有一定设备随时可以装备毁灭性武器的飞机在内。美方的这种荒谬主张，朝中方面曾经在1953年10月3日发表公报予以揭露和驳斥。
    接着，美方就在同年10月12日指控朝中方面装箱运入作战飞机，企图为实现自己的无理要求制造借口。但是中立国监察委员会的机动视察小组在现场调查的结果，证明美方这种指控完全是造谣。
    在这以后，美方破坏朝鲜停战协定的惯技，就是一面诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，一面却不断向朝鲜境内运入大量武器装备。可是，这一手花招并没有能够逃过人们的眼睛。中立国监察委员会关于1953年10月份和11月份双方轮换和替换的综合报告的审定草案，证实朝中方面并无违反停战协定的行为，而美国方面却从境外运进大批增援性军事物资。中立国监察委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员，后来又提出了一个“关于联合国军方面在1953年7月27日至1954年4月15日期间违反停战协定以军事增援进入朝鲜的报告”。中立国监察委员会的存在，已经成为美方任意违反停战协定道路上的严重障碍。因此，美方就把中立国监察委员会视为眼中钉，指使李承晚集团阻挠中立国监察委员会的活动，并且最后逼迫它停止了在南朝鲜的工作。事实非常明显，一贯违反停战协定的不是别人，正是美国方面。
    美国现在公然宣布取消第二条第十三款，以便把所谓“新式武器”运进朝鲜，这是同它在亚洲制造紧张局势的阴谋分不开的。在美国侵略集团的战略计划里，朝鲜南部、中国的台湾和越南南部，始终是美国侵略中国的三条战线、三个重要的侵略基地。由于最近亚洲各国人民反美情绪的高涨和美国对华政策的失败，美国统治集团惊慌起来了。它们害怕亚洲局势将进一步走向缓和，因此千方百计地要加紧控制这三个军事基地，并在这三个地区制造紧张局势，以便阻挠亚洲局势的缓和。美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为，就是继美国同吴庭艳会谈、在台湾派驻导弹部队以后所采取的又一个步骤。
    停战协定同任何国际协议一样是一个整体，一部分条款的遭到破坏，势必影响其他条款的执行，从而使协定丧失它的完整性和有效性。而且，美国既然今天可以用这种借口片面废除协定的第二条第十三款，明天更可以用别种借口片面废除其它条款。李承晚集团已经叫嚣要趁此机会撕毁停战协定，这就是一个证明。必须警告美国侵略集团：美国这种片面取消停战条款的行动，对朝鲜停战的稳定和亚洲和平形成了严重威胁。这是朝中方面和全世界爱好和平的人民决不能容许的事情。美国对于由此而引起的一切后果，必须担负全部责任。同时，容许美国这样做的联合国军方面的其他国家，也不能逃避应负的责任。朝中方面将为维护停战协定、为反对美国的非法破坏行动而进行坚决的斗争。
