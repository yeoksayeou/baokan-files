Visiting Japan's Chemical Fiber Industry and Silk Industry
Chen Chengzhong, Manager of China Silk Corporation

Recently, at the invitation of the Japan-China Import and Export Association and Japanese chemical fiber manufacturers, the China Silk Corporation sent a delegation to Japan for a month-long friendly visit. The China Silk Corporation delegation was the first specialized trade delegation from New China to visit Japan. This visit reflects the common desire of both countries to further develop trade. Because this type of specialized visit allows both sides to directly exchange opinions in a more in-depth and specific manner, communicate supply and demand situations, enhance mutual understanding, and jointly seek possibilities for expanding bilateral trade. This has a positive and beneficial effect on developing Sino-Japanese trade and enhancing the friendly relations between the two peoples.

Japan is one of the world's major producers and exporters of chemical fibers. China and Japan have close relations in the chemical fiber trade. For a long time, Japanese chemical fibers have had a certain sales market in China. Since the founding of New China, trade in this area has grown rapidly, especially in rayon, from more than 200,000 pounds in 1952 to more than 5 million pounds in 1956, accounting for about 30% of Japan's rayon exports. Due to the close business relationship between the two sides, both felt that establishing a stable supply was beneficial to both producers and sellers. During our visit to Japan, we held many talks with Japanese chemical fiber manufacturers, communicated information, exchanged specific ideas on expanding future business, and signed some contracts to further expand business. Although the volume of rayon transactions was not large, we felt that through this exchange, we communicated information, enhanced understanding, and strengthened business relations, which is beneficial to expanding future business.

During our visit to Japan, we visited many Japanese chemical fiber factories, which gave us a better understanding of the Japanese chemical fiber industry. Japan's chemical fiber industry has developed rapidly in recent years and occupies an important position in the textile industry. In 1956, the average annual consumption of textile fibers per person in Japan was 17 pounds, of which chemical fibers accounted for 42%; in 1956, exports of chemical fibers and their finished products accounted for 12% of the country's total exports. In 1956, Japan's production of rayon staple fiber ranked first in the world, and rayon ranked second. This shows that the chemical fiber industry occupies a considerable position in Japan's national economy.

In the production of various textiles, blended and interwoven fabrics are very common. These mainly include blends of rayon staple fiber and nylon, vinylon; and interwoven fabrics of chemical fibers and natural fibers. The use of this method of interweaving and blending different fibers can allow various fibers to complement each other's shortcomings, improve performance, improve quality, and also reduce costs and increase use value, which has great economic significance. Most of Japan's chemical fiber factories are concentrated in coastal and riverside areas. This not only facilitates the transportation of raw materials and finished products, but also solves the problems of water use and wastewater discharge.

The development of chemical fiber production in Japan has left us with a deep impression. After visiting the Japanese chemical fiber industry, we deeply felt the necessity of developing my country's chemical fiber industry. Our country has a large population, and as people's living standards improve, the need for textile fibers will increase. Although the output of cotton cloth and cotton yarn has increased greatly in the years since liberation, it still cannot meet the needs of the people. And the expansion of cotton planting area cannot but be limited to a certain extent. Therefore, actively establishing and developing my country's chemical fiber industry is an important measure to supplement the shortage of textile raw materials. It is not only necessary but also possible to develop the chemical fiber industry in our country. Not to mention that we have a broad domestic market to guarantee the sales of products, and in terms of chemical fiber raw materials, such as wood, reeds, limestone and coal, and even bagasse, etc., can be supplied in our country. Compared with Japan, which relies on imports for one-third of its raw materials and depends heavily on exports for a large part of its products, this is a very favorable condition for us. We believe that technical exchanges with Japan in the field of chemical fibers are entirely possible and necessary. We hope that relations between the two countries will normalize as soon as possible to provide the necessary conditions for this exchange of experience.

China and Japan are both major countries in the world with a long history of silkworm and mulberry production. Japan's silkworm and mulberry production was severely damaged during the war. Although it is still far below the pre-war level, it still accounts for the first place in the world's silk production. We took this opportunity to visit key silkworm and mulberry production areas. Japanese friends attach great importance to scientific research in silkworm and mulberry production in order to increase the unit yield of silk. Research institutions are widely established. In addition to a unified institution, local governments also have experimental institutions. At the same time, attention is also paid to training technical personnel. Universities have silkworm and mulberry majors, and counties and production institutions also have secondary technical schools, with more than a thousand students graduating each year. Improving the unit yield of silkworm and mulberry production is the central task of scientific research. At present, each mu of mulberry garden can produce 1,500 catties of leaves per year, silkworm cocoons spin 1,100 meters of silk, and 600 catties of fresh cocoons can be reeled into one dan of silk, with a higher unit yield than in our country.

For a long time, China and Japan have had close relations in silkworm and mulberry production. In this contact, many Japanese friends were worried that the development of China's silk production would compete with them in sales. We believe that this is an unnecessary concern. My country has a vast market of 600 million people. At present, silk is far from meeting market demand. In the future, as people's living standards improve, the demand for silk will also increase. Therefore, as the world's major silk-producing countries, China and Japan should cooperate closely, exchange advanced technical experience, and work together to develop silk production.

We believe that the role of professional visits is very important, and we hope that they will become more frequent in the future to promote mutual understanding, promote the further development of Sino-Japanese trade, and enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

    参观日本的化学纤维工业和蚕丝业
    中国丝绸公司经理　陈诚中
    最近，中国丝绸公司应日本日中输出入协会和日本化学纤维厂商的邀请，派代表团到日本作了为期一个月的友好访问。中国丝绸公司访问团是新中国成立后第一个访问日本的专业性贸易代表团。这一访问反映着两国要求进一步发展贸易的共同愿望。因为这种专业性的访问可使双方较深入具体地直接交换意见，沟通供需情况，增进彼此间的了解，共同寻求扩大双方贸易的可能性。这对发展中日贸易和增进两国人民间的友好关系，都有着积极有利的作用。
    日本是世界化学纤维的主要生产和出口国家之一。中日两国在化学纤维贸易方面有着密切的关系。很久以来，日本化学纤维在中国就有着一定的销售市场。新中国成立后，在这方面的贸易有了很快的增长，尤其是人造丝，从1952年的二十多万磅增加到1956年的五百多万磅，占日本人造丝出口数量的30％左右。由于彼此间密切的业务关系，双方都感到建立稳定性的供应对产销双方都是有好处的。我们在访日期间，曾与日本化学纤维厂商进行了多次的洽谈，相互沟通了情况，交换了扩大今后的具体意见，并签订了一些合同，进一步扩大了业务。人造丝虽然成交不大，但我们感到通过这次交谈，相互沟通了情况，增进了了解，密切了业务关系，对于扩大今后业务是有好处的。
    我们访日期间，参观了日本的许多个化学纤维工厂，使我们对日本化学纤维工业的情况有了进一步的了解。日本的化学纤维工业这几年来发展很快，在纺织业中占有重要地位。1956年日本平均每人全年消费纺织纤维十七磅，其中化学纤维即占42％；1956年化学纤维及其成品的出口占全国出口总值的12％。1956年日本人造棉产量占世界第一位，人造丝占第二位，由此可见，化学纤维工业在日本国民经济中占有相当的地位。
    在各种纺织品生产中，混纺及交织品是很普遍的。其中主要有人造棉和尼龙、维尼龙的混纺；化学纤维和天然纤维的交织品。采用这种不同纤维的交织和混纺的办法，可以使各种纤维相互弥补缺点，改进性能，提高质量，亦可以降低成本，提高使用价值，有很大经济意义。日本的化学纤维工厂绝大部分集中在沿海和沿河流地区，这样，不仅可以便利原材料和成品的运输，同时也可以解决用水和废水的排除问题。
    日本化学纤维生产的发展给我们留下了深刻的印象。从参观日本化学纤维工业后，我们深感发展我国化学纤维的必要。我国人口众多，随着人民生活的改善，纺织纤维的需要将日益增加。虽然解放后几年来，棉布和棉纱的产量都有了很大增长，但仍不能满足人民的需要。而棉花播种面积的扩大又不能不有一定的限制。因此，积极地建立和发展我国的化学纤维工业是补充纺织原料不足的一项重要措施。在我国发展化学纤维工业，不仅很必要，同时也是可能的。不用提我们有着广阔的国内市场可保证产品的销路，而在化学纤维原料方面，如木材、芦苇、石灰石和煤炭，乃至甘蔗渣等等，在我国都可以得到供应。较之日本有三分之一的原料须依靠进口，而产品很大部分又依赖出口的情况，这是我们很有利的条件。我们认为与日本进行化学纤维方面的技术交流，是完全可能与必要的。我们希望两国关系早日正常化，为这种经验交流提供必要条件。
    中日两国都是历史悠久的世界蚕桑生产的主要国家。日本蚕桑生产在战争期间受到严重破坏，虽然目前仍远低于战前水平，但仍占世界蚕丝产量的第一位。我们借这次访问机会到过蚕桑重点产地进行参观。日本朋友为了提高蚕丝单位产量，对蚕桑生产的科学研究工作很重视，研究机构设置很普遍，除有统一机构外，各地方政府也设有试验机构。同时也注意培养技术人员，在高等学校设有蚕桑专业，各县和生产机构也都有中等技术学校，每年毕业学生在千人以上。提高蚕桑生产单位产量是科学研究的中心任务，目前每亩桑园年可产叶一千五百市斤，蚕茧吐丝长一千一百公尺，每六百斤鲜茧可缫丝一担，单位产量较我国为高。
    很久以来，中日两国在蚕桑生产上就有着密切的关系。在这次接触中，许多日本朋友担心中国蚕丝生产发展后会与其竞销，我们认为这是不必要的顾虑。我国有六亿人口的广阔市场，目前丝绸远不能满足市场需要，今后随着人民生活水平的提高，对丝绸的需要也将日益增长。因此，作为世界蚕丝生产的主要国家的中日两国，应该密切合作，相互交流先进技术经验，为发展蚕丝生产而共同努力。
    我们认为专业性访问的作用是很大的，希望今后会日益频繁起来，以沟通相互间的了解，促进中日贸易的进一步发展，并增进中日两国人民间的友谊。（附图片）
