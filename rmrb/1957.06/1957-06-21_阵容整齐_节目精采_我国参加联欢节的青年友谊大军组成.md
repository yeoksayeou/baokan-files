The artistic programs that China will present at the upcoming 6th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Moscow are more extensive than those presented at previous festivals. The sports events in which China will participate at the International Youth Friendship Games held during the festival will also be more numerous than in the past. Yesterday, the China Preparatory Committee for the World Youth Festival held a press conference to introduce the preparations for China's participation in the festival.

The Chinese Youth Art Troupe participating in the festival consists of 405 people, including young actors from twelve ethnic groups. Among them are well-known artists, as well as workers, directors and members of agricultural cooperatives; there are university students, teachers, and also child actors. The art troupe will perform more than one hundred dance, music, Peking Opera, and acrobatics programs, with the overall artistic characteristics being rich in national style and local flavor. At the festival, youth from various countries will appreciate the wonderful performances of China's famous young artists: these include Du Jinfang's "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," Guan Sushuang's "Sizhou City," Huang Yuanqing's "Lion's Tower," and Li Xiaochun's "Nezha Stirs Up the Sea," as well as Hong Xiannv's Cantonese Opera a cappella and Wei Xikui's storytelling performances; they can listen to the solo performances of Chinese young singers Wen Kezheng, Zou Dehua and others; they can see the acrobatics of Sun Tai and Qiao Pinghai, winners of the gold medal at last year's Warsaw International Acrobatic Competition; they can also see the dances of many Chinese ethnic groups and regions, as well as the newly choreographed "Asian-African Youth Grand Unity Dance" by Chinese dancer Dai Ailian. These excellent programs were all selected this year from national professional group concerts and national folk music and dance performances. During the period of intensive rehearsals in Beijing in April, all the comrades participating in the art performance worked hard and practiced diligently, striving for perfection.

The sports team, composed of approximately 160 outstanding young Chinese athletes, will participate in nine events at the International Youth Friendship Games, including basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, tennis, track and field, weightlifting, gymnastics, and swimming. According to the person in charge, this is also the largest number of athletes and events in international competitions that Chinese athletes have participated in before. Among them are China's sports stars such as Chen Jingkai, Shi Baozhu, and Qi Lieyun, as well as some new forces.

China's gift of 15,000 silk scarves and 10,000 cloth scarves for the festival has been sent to Moscow. Youth from various places have also automatically sent many valuable gifts to the festival. Among them, one eye-catching gift is the "Flower and Grass Collection" sent by Zheng Xuemao, a soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, from Korea, pasted with specimens of Korean flowers and trees such as maple leaves and azaleas. This very exquisite collection of specimens was diligently collected by him during the gaps in fighting and labor in Korea over the past few years. He wrote on this collection that he gave this beloved "Flower and Grass Collection" to the festival to let young people all over the world who love peace know how much the Chinese People's Volunteers love every flower and tree on Korean soil.

　　阵容整齐　节目精采
    我国参加联欢节的青年友谊大军组成
    本报讯　我国这次参加莫斯科第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的艺术节目比过去参加历届联欢节的节目都要丰富，我国参加联欢节期间举行的国际青年友谊运动会的体育项目也比过去多。昨天中国参加世界青年联欢节筹备委员会举行记者招待会，介绍了我国参加联欢节的筹备情况。
    参加联欢节的中国青年艺术团由四百零五人组成，包括十二个民族的青年演员，其中有著名的艺术家，也有工人和农业合作社的主任和社员；有大学生、教师，也有儿童演员。艺术团参加演出的舞蹈、音乐、京剧和杂技各项节目共计一百多个，整个艺术节目的特色是富有民族风格和地方色彩。在联欢节上，各国青年将会欣赏到我国著名青年艺术家的精采表演：其中有杜近芳的“嫦娥奔月”、关肃霜的“泗洲城”、黄元庆的“狮子楼”和李小春的“哪叱闹海”，以及红线女的清唱、魏喜奎的曲艺；可以听到我国青年歌唱家温可铮、邹德华等人的独唱；可以看到去年华沙国际杂技竞赛金质奖章获得者孙泰和乔平海的杂技；还可以看到我国许多民族和地方的舞蹈以及我国舞蹈家戴爱莲新编的“亚非青年大联欢舞”。这些精采节目都是今年从全国专业团体音乐会演、全国民间音乐舞蹈会演中选拔出来的。4月间集中在北京排练，参加艺术表演的同志们，在这一期间，真是人人勤排苦练，精益求精。
    由我国优秀青年运动员大约一百六十人组成的体育队，在国际青年友谊运动会上将参加篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球、网球、田径、举重、体操和游泳等九项比赛。据负责人说，这也是我国运动员从前参加过的国际比赛中人数和项目最多的。其中有的是我国的运动健将如陈镜开、石宝珠、戚烈云等人，还有一些新生力量。
    我国赠给联欢节的一万五千条丝制头巾和一万条布制头巾已经送往莫斯科。各处青年也自动送给联欢节许多可贵的礼物，其中有一件引人注目的礼物，是中国人民志愿军某部郑雪茂从朝鲜寄来的、贴着枫叶和金达莱花等朝鲜花木标本的“花草集”。这个十分精致的标本集是他在朝鲜几年来战斗和劳动的空隙中辛勤采集的。他在这个集子上写道，他把这本心爱的“花草集”赠给联欢节，是要全世界爱好和平的青年知道，中国人民志愿军是怎样热爱朝鲜国土上的一花一木的。（附图片）
