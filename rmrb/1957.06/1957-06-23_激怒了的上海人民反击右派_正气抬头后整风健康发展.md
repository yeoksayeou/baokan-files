　　People's Daily Shanghai Dispatch, June 22nd: An intense political struggle against the rightists is unfolding victoriously in Shanghai. During this period, the rightists appearing in Shanghai, like those appearing in other regions, took advantage of the opportunity to “bloom and contend,” touting the banner of helping the Party rectify its work, and spreading various anti-socialist, anti-Communist Party leadership remarks. In mid-May, during the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's propaganda work conference in conjunction with the rectification campaign, the reactionary words and actions of the rightists were gradually exposed.

　　The means by which some Shanghai rightists opposed the Party and socialism was, first and foremost, to depict the leadership of the Communist Party as utterly worthless and to portray the Communist Party and the People's Government as a complete darkness. Chen Renbing, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that these are days of utter darkness. He advocated settling accounts with the Communist Party. He went to grassroots organization symposiums many times to collect various situations. Whoever cursed the Communist Party the most fiercely became a good object for providing materials. He particularly hated the activists who gathered around the Party and spoke fairly, posing everywhere as an advocate for intellectuals, attempting to isolate the Party. Opposition to socialist construction and socialist transformation was also a characteristic of the rightists' activities. Wang Zao Shi, a professor at Fudan University, said that from Beijing to Shanghai, the schools run by the Communist Party were all messing around. He said that the Communist Party had no rule of law, and the American spirit of rule of law was worth learning. Some rightists even openly advocated reducing national investment in industrialization. They cursed the Party’s general line for the transition period as a dead end. Another characteristic of the rightists' activities in Shanghai was deliberately disrupting the steps of the rectification, distorting the Party's spirit of rectification, and fearing that the world would not be in chaos. Wang Zao Shi openly and repeatedly stated that the focus of the rectification should not be placed in organs above the county level. Rightists believed that the Party's policy of curing the sickness to save the patient was wrong, and that it was necessary to pick out several Party members for effective treatment. Lu Yi, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai News, threatened to drive out Jin Zhonghua, the editor-in-chief, and have himself "take command." He wanted Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to revolt and wanted to watch the "Communist Party's play."

　　The Shanghai people from all walks of life, enraged by the rightists, have held continuous symposiums in factories, schools, rural areas, and organizations in recent days, angrily denouncing these absurd remarks. Old worker Shi Xiaomei said: Some people say to abolish the leadership of the Party and the working class and take the capitalist road, which the broad masses of the people will never allow. I, who crawled out from under Chiang Kai-shek's butcher knife, understand very well that only the Communist Party can lead our working class to turn over, can lead us to build socialism, and can give us a good life. Many scientific workers who are immersed in the laboratory also stood up and said that these rightist remarks must be verbally and penally criticized. The famous biologist Feng Depei said that these anti-socialist remarks beyond the scope of the Constitution must be resolutely countered. At the symposium held by the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, people stood up to expose the ulterior motives of rightists such as Wang Zao Shi and Chen Renbing. Hong Wenlan used his recent inspection of judicial work in Hongkou District, Shanghai, to prove that our country's rule of law work is good. Many people also pointed out that only the United States, which Wang Zao Shi praised, truly has no rule of law: the Liu Ziran case in Taiwan and the Rosenberg couple case in the United States are the best illustrations.

　　Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people has added infinite strength to the people of Shanghai who are in the midst of intense struggle. In recent days, workers, peasants, and students have automatically gathered to express that they must study Chairman Mao's report well, use this report as a weapon, resolutely oppose the rightists, and, in accordance with the spirit of this report, strengthen the unity among the people.

　　The just voices from all social strata are the best supervision for the democratic parties. In recent days, fierce anti-rightist struggles have also unfolded within the democratic parties. The majority of members of the democratic parties unanimously stated that they will never allow the rightists to use and manipulate them. Chen Wangdao, one of the responsible persons of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that it is necessary to distinguish between right and wrong with the rightists and it is necessary to "contend." Yin Dayu, a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, extensively exposed the activities of the rightists within the league. The vast majority of members expressed that they would draw a clear line with the rightists. On the 19th, the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League issued a written statement stating that it would unswervingly accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road.

　　The situation of the anti-rightist struggle in Shanghai shows that the situation is not very wonderful for the rightists who attempt to attack the Party and oppose the people, rather than for the Communists and the broad masses of patriotic and Party-loving people. After their words and actions were exposed, they became even more isolated among the masses. Chen Renbing, who styled himself as an advocate for intellectuals, has been stripped of his beautiful coat and is actually a provocateur who lights fires everywhere, fearing that the world will not be in chaos. In the face of these iron facts, people have received profound education. Biologist Tan Jiazhen said that in the past I was a bit bookish and didn't ask about anything, but now it seems that this is not good. In this struggle, he participated in several symposiums in a row and issued solemn questions to the rightists. Many fourth-year students of the Chinese Department of East China Normal University narrated their experiences of getting to know the rightists at the meeting to criticize the rightists, expressing that they would rely more closely on the Party.

　　The struggle against the rightists has created favorable conditions for the Party's rectification movement. In Shanghai, the evil winds once raised their heads under the disturbance of the rightists in some units. Activists did not dare to speak, the correct opinions of the masses were suppressed, and the gap between leaders and the led was difficult to bridge. After the words and actions of the rightists were exposed, righteousness was promoted, and the rectification movement is gradually developing in a healthy direction. While opposing the rightists, people are, in the spirit of benefiting socialist construction, boldly and sharply putting forward opinions and suggestions on the Party's various tasks as before. Party leaders in various units are busy listening to opinions from all sides and seeking plans to improve their work.

### 激怒了的上海人民反击右派  正气抬头后整风健康发展

　　激怒了的上海人民反击右派
    正气抬头后整风健康发展
    本报上海22日专电　一场激烈的反右派的政治斗争，正在上海胜利地开展中。这一时期以来，在上海出现的右派分子，和其他地区出现的右派分子一样，利用大放大鸣的机会，掮着帮助党整风的招牌，散布各种反社会主义、反共产党领导的言论。5月中旬，中共上海市委结合整风召开宣传工作会议期间，右派分子的反动言行即陆续暴露出来。
    上海一些右派分子反党反社会主义的手段，首先是把共产党的领导说得一无是处，把共产党和人民政府描写成一团漆黑。民盟上海市委副主任委员陈仁炳说，现在是暗无天日的日子。他提倡要和共产党算账。他曾经多次到基层组织座谈会，收集各种情况。谁骂共产党最凶，谁就成为提供材料的好对象。他特别痛恨围绕在党的周围和说公道话的积极分子，他处处摆着为知识分子撑腰者的姿态笼络群众，企图使党陷于孤立。反对社会主义建设和社会主义改造，也是右派分子活动的特点之一。复旦大学教授王造时说，从北京到上海，共产党办的学校都在鬼混。他说共产党没有法制，美国的法制精神值得学习。还有一些右派分子甚至公然主张减少国家在工业化方面的投资。他们诅咒国家的过渡时期总路线是死路一条。上海右派分子活动的另一个特点是故意打乱整风步骤，歪曲党的整风精神，唯恐天下不乱。王造时曾经公开地一再地表示整风的重点不应该放在县以上的机关里。右派分子认为党的治病救人的方针是错误的，认为必须挑出几个党员加以有效的处理。上海新闻日报副总编辑陆诒扬言要赶走社长金仲华，由他自己“挂帅”。他要党团员起义，还要看“共产党的戏”。
    被右派分子激怒了的上海各界人民，最近几天以来，在工厂、学校、农村、机关团体里，不断地举行座谈会，愤怒地痛斥这些荒谬言论。老工人施小妹说：有人说取消党和工人阶级的领导，走资本主义道路，广大人民绝不允许。我这个从蒋介石屠刀下钻出来的人，很明白只有共产党才能领导我们工人阶级翻身，才能领导我们建设社会主义，才能给我们好日子过。许多埋头在试验室中的科学工作者也站起来说，对这些右派分子的言论，必须口诛笔伐。著名的生物学家冯德培说，对这些超出宪法范围的反社会主义言论，必须坚决反击。在市政协举行的座谈会上，人们纷纷起来揭发王造时、陈仁炳等右派分子别有用心的阴谋。洪文澜就最近视察上海虹口区司法工作的情况，证明我国的法治工作是良好的。不少的人还指出，只有王造时赞扬的美国，才真正是没有法治：台湾的刘自然案，美国的罗森堡夫妇案，就是最好的说明。
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，给正在紧张斗争中的上海人民增加了无穷的力量。连日来工人、农民和学生自动集会，表示一定要很好地学习毛主席的报告，用这个报告作武器，坚决反对右派分子；按照这个报告的精神，加强人民内部团结。
    来自社会各阶层的正义呼声，对各民主党派是一种最好的监督。连日各民主党派内部也展开了激烈的反右派斗争。民主党派中的大多数成员一致表示，决不让右派分子利用和操纵。民盟上海市委负责人之一——陈望道说，一定要和右派分子分清大是大非，一定要“争”。民盟上海市委工作人员尹大雨大量揭露了右派分子在盟内的活动情况。绝大多数盟员都表示要和右派分子划清界限。19日民盟市委发表了书面声明，表示坚定不移地接受党的领导，走社会主义道路。
    上海反右派斗争的情况表明，在斗争中情况不大美妙的并不是共产党人和爱国爱党的广大群众，而是那些企图打击党和反对人民的右派分子。他们的言行被揭露以后，在群众中也就更加孤立了。自封为知识分子撑腰者的陈仁炳已被剥去了美丽的外衣，原来是个到处点火，唯恐天下不乱的挑拨分子。在这些铁的事实面前，人们得到了深刻的教育。生物学家谈家桢说，过去我有些书生气，什么事都不闻不问，现在看来这样不行。在这次斗争中，他接连参加了好几次座谈会，向右派分子发出了严正的质问。华东师范大学中文系四年级学生在批判右派分子的会议上，许多人叙述了自己认识右派分子的经过，表示要和党更加靠拢。
    反对右派分子的斗争，给党的整风运动创造了顺利的条件。上海若干单位在右派分子的扰乱下，歪风曾经一度抬头。积极分子不敢讲话，群众的正确意见受到压抑，领导和被领导间的隔阂难以打通。右派分子的言行被揭发后，正气得以发扬，整风运动正逐步向健康方向发展。人们在反对右派的同时，本着有利于社会主义建设的精神，和从前一样大胆地、尖锐地向党的各项工作提出意见和建议。各单位党的负责人，正在忙于听取各方面的意见，寻求改进工作的方案。
