　　Spotted Dove
　　—Guizhou Poetic Grass
　　Fang Ping
　　In the bamboo grove,
　　From the bamboo grove flew out two spotted doves,
　　Perching on a tree, constantly looking back;
　　The young hunter wanted to shoot them down at the same time,
　　Unexpectedly, they flew away at the sound of the gunshot.
　　The spotted doves flew over the hillside, the hunter chased over the hillside,
　　The spotted doves flew over the small river, the hunter chased over the small river,
　　The hunter was already panting and out of breath,
　　But the spotted doves were singing on a tree.
　　The hunter raised his gun for the second time but still missed,
　　They hurriedly flew towards a village.
　　The hunter rushed there but couldn't find the spotted doves,
　　He only saw a young girl standing at the entrance of the village.
　　This young man from another village walked up and asked:
　　"Girl! Have you seen two spotted doves?"
　　The girl smiled slightly, her big eyes shining,
　　She sized up the other person before speaking.
　　"You don't need to be so anxious to shoot spotted doves,
　　In our place, there are spotted doves on every tree.
　　Come into the house and rest for a while, guest!
　　Look at your head, sweat is constantly flowing."
　　The girl invited the guest into her home,
　　Poured a cup of clear tea and took out a pot of sweet wine;
　　The clear tea was brewed with tea leaves picked by the girl herself,
　　The sweet wine was also brewed by the girl's own hands.
　　The guest drank tea and talked with the girl,
　　He discovered that the girl was a very good singer;
　　The guest drank wine and sang with the girl,
　　Their singing continued until dusk.
　　Despite the constant cooing in the woods,
　　Despite the loaded shotgun right at the door,
　　The young hunter was already intoxicated by the singing,
　　He had long forgotten about shooting spotted doves.

　　斑鸠
　　——贵州诗草
　　放平
　　竹丛里
　　竹丛里飞出了两只斑鸠，
　　停落在一棵树上不住地回头；
　　年青的猎人想同时把它们打下，
　　没料到枪声一响它们已经飞走。
　　斑鸠飞过山坡，猎人赶过山坡，
　　斑鸠飞过小河，猎人赶过小河，
　　猎人赶得已经气喘吁吁，
　　斑鸠却在一株树上唱歌。
　　猎人第二次举起枪来又没打中，
　　它们慌忙飞向一个村落。
　　猎人赶到那里不见了斑鸠，
　　只见一个年青的姑娘站在村口。
　　这个外寨的青年走拢去问：
　　“姑娘！你可曾看见两只斑鸠？”
　　姑娘亮着大眼睛微微一笑，
　　她先打量一下对方，然后开口。
　　“你要打斑鸠用不着这样着忙，
　　在我们这里，每一棵树上都有。
　　快进屋来歇一歇吧，客人！
　　你看你头上，汗珠子一直在流。”
　　姑娘把客人请到自己家里，
　　倒了一杯清茶又取出一壶甜酒；
　　清茶泡的是姑娘自己摘的茶叶，
　　甜酒的酿成也出自姑娘的双手。
　　客人边喝茶边同姑娘说话，
　　他发现姑娘是一个很好的歌手；
　　客人边喝酒边同姑娘对歌，
　　他们这一唱竟唱到了黄昏时候。
　　尽管树林里的咕咕声叫个不休，
　　尽管上了子弹的猎枪就在门口，
　　年青的猎人已在歌声中陶醉，
　　他早就忘记了还要去打斑鸠。
