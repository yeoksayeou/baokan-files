Intellectuals in a Socialist Society Should Possess the Thoughts and Feelings of the Working Class
Wang Li, Professor of Peking University

On June 8th, while right-wingers were vociferously airing their views, the People's Daily began publishing news of workers denouncing the right-wingers. Subsequently, on June 10th, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "The Workers Speak." Some intellectuals felt uncomfortable reading this. Some said, "This is putting the working class and intellectuals in opposition to each other; isn't that going too far?" Others said, "The workers keep saying the same things, just comparing today's life with the life before liberation. Their thinking is simple, and not convincing."

I don't understand: Why would the working class and intellectuals be opposed to each other? Intellectuals cannot be a class themselves; they either belong to the bourgeoisie or to the working class. In today's China, intellectuals who belong to the bourgeoisie are old intellectuals, and intellectuals who belong to the working class are new-type intellectuals. In the eight years since liberation, more and more old intellectuals have transformed into new-type intellectuals, and some have even joined the Communist Party. Most intellectuals have joined the trade union; nominally, they belong to the working class, and they enjoy the welfare that workers should enjoy. They stayed in workers' sanatoriums when escaping the summer heat at the seaside; however, the thoughts and feelings of some intellectuals still conflict with the thoughts and feelings of the workers today. They look down on the workers, and in their thoughts and feelings, they don't feel they are workers; or they consider themselves mental laborers, superior to manual laborers. We talk about ideological remolding every day; it is precisely on this most important issue that many people's thinking has not changed. I think this is a matter of stance. Gentlemen who feel uncomfortable seeing the title "The Workers Speak" need to examine their own thinking.

I don't understand: Why is a clear comparison between today's life and the life before liberation not convincing? Why have a revolution? Isn't it for the happiness of the people? Why build a socialist society? Isn't it for a better life ahead, to satisfy the material and cultural needs of the people to the greatest extent? Today, people's lives have improved, and we can see a beautiful future. Facts speak louder than words. What theory is more convincing than this? Right-wingers slander our people's regime precisely by claiming that "the people's lives have not improved." Isn't it good enough that the workers and peasants use ironclad facts to prove that they are lying? The most profound political theory ultimately aims to achieve the simplest political goal; in a country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, whether the political goal can be achieved depends on whether it can satisfy the demands of the working masses. The workers and peasants fully understand this political goal, so they support the people's regime. That's enough! Without this political goal, even if the right-wingers are eloquent, they cannot incite the workers and peasants. Intellectuals who do not integrate with workers and peasants will achieve nothing, let alone try to resist the current like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. As the ancients said, "Scholars who rebel will not succeed in three years." I see two kinds of scholars: The first kind is scholars who are closely linked to the hammer and sickle. This kind of scholars' rebellion has already succeeded, the landlords have been overthrown, and the exploiting classes have been basically eliminated. The second kind is scholars who yearn for bourgeois politics and tend towards nihilism. This kind of scholars' rebellion will not succeed in thirty years, let alone three! Whether we like it or not, we must listen to the workers and peasants.

Some intellectuals think that workers have simple minds; some intellectuals think that their brains are bigger than the workers' brains. I think: Although no one has conducted "scientific research" on the brains of intellectuals, it is unlikely that they are bigger than the brains of workers. As for whether the intellectuals' minds are more complex than the workers' minds? It can be said with certainty that they are more complex. However, I think there are two kinds of complexity in the mind: One is the mind of new-type intellectuals, filled with rich theoretical knowledge, and at the same time, they stand firmly on the position of the working class. This kind of mind is beneficial to socialism, and we are cultivating this kind of intellectuals (especially among the children of workers and peasants). The other is the mind of old intellectuals. Leaving aside the minds of extremely reactionary right-wingers, even the general intellectuals like us who are willing to transform our thinking, still have remnants of bourgeois ideology entrenched in our minds. These ideological remnants often attempt to restore themselves in our minds. This kind of complexity inevitably carries great danger. Therefore, we should not only not be proud of having complex minds, but should also be vigilant about ourselves because of having complex minds.

Intellectuals in a socialist society should possess the thoughts and feelings of the working class. With this kind of thoughts and feelings, they can fully "contend" and "bloom", help the Party conduct rectification, and have no worries. With this kind of thoughts and feelings, they can hate evil as much as they hate their enemies and wage a resolute struggle against the right-wingers. When I was in Beijing, I learned the moving news that the workers of the Beijing Printing Factory No. 1 refused to print reactionary publications; recently, I came to Qingdao and heard that when a few right-wing students posted reactionary big-character posters on the street, they were severely questioned by the workers. This kind of working-class sense of justice is worthy of our admiration. The thoughts and feelings of the workers are the simplest, and also the most valuable. We must learn from the worker comrades, first of all, we must transform our thinking, so that we can have the thoughts and feelings of the working class.

### 社会主义社会的知识分子应有工人阶级的思想感情

　　社会主义社会的知识分子应有工人阶级的思想感情
　　北京大学教授　王力
    6月8日，正在右派分子大放厥词的时候，人民日报开始登载了工人们痛斥右派分子的消息。随后在6月10日，人民日报又发表一篇社论，题目是“工人说话了”。有些知识分子看了不舒服。有人说：“这是把工人阶级和知识分子对立起来，未免太过火了。”有人说：“工人们说来说去都不过是那几句话，不外是拿今天的生活和解放前的生活作个对比，思想简单，没有说服力。”
    我不明白：工人阶级为什么会和知识分子对立起来？知识分子自己不能成为一个阶级；或者是属于资产阶级，或者是属于工人阶级。在今天的中国，属于资产阶级的知识分子是旧知识分子，属于工人阶级的知识分子是新型的知识分子。解放八年以来，越来越多的旧知识分子向新型的知识分子转化，有些人已经参加了共产党。大部分知识分子已经参加了工会，在名义上他们属于工人阶级，工人应享受的福利他们享受到了，他们在海滨避暑住了工人招待所；但是，某些知识分子的思想感情到今天还和工人们的思想感情发生矛盾。他们看不起工人们，从思想感情上他们不觉得自己是工人；或者自以为是脑力劳动者，要比体力劳动者高一等。我们天天谈思想改造；就在这一个最重要的问题上，许多人的思想还没有转变过来。我觉得，这就是一个立场问题。看见“工人说话了”这个标题而感到不舒服的先生们，有必要检查一下自己的思想。
    我不明白：拿今天的生活和解放前的生活作一个鲜明的对比，为什么没有说服力？为什么要革命？还不是为了人民的幸福？为什么要建设社会主义社会？还不是为了前面的美好生活，在最大程度上满足人民物质生活和文化生活的要求？今天人民生活改善了，还看见了美丽的远景，事实胜于雄辩，还有什么理论比这个说服力更强呢？右派分子诬蔑我们的人民政权，正是从“人民生活没有改善”说起的，工人、农民们拿铁一般的事实来证明他们在撒谎，那还不够好吗？从来最高深的政治理论也不过是要达到最简单的政治目的；在工人阶级领导、工农联盟为基础的国家里政治目的能否达到，要看是否能满足工农大众的要求。这一个政治目的，工人农民们是充分了解的，因此他们对人民政权是拥护的。这就够了！离开了这个政治目的，右派分子那怕是舌粲莲花，也煽动不了工农大众。知识分子不与工农结合，将一事无成，何况要学螳臂当车，和工人农民们作对呢？古人说：“秀才造反，三年不成”。我看有两种秀才：第一种是和铁锤镰刀密切联系的秀才，这种秀才造反早已成功了，地主打垮了，剥削阶级基本上消灭了；第二种是向往资产阶级政治和倾向虚无主义的秀才，这种秀才造反，休说三年，三十年也成不了事！不管我们愿意或者不愿意，工人农民们的话是不能不听的。
    有些知识分子以为工人们脑筋简单；有些知识分子以为自己的大脑比工人们的大脑更大一些。我想：虽然没有人对知识分子的大脑进行过“科学研究”，但是比工人们的大脑更大一些是不会的。至于知识分子的脑筋，是不是比工人们的脑筋更复杂一些呢？肯定地说，是要复杂一些。但是，我看脑筋的复杂情况也有两种：一种是新型的知识分子的脑筋，充满了丰富的理论知识，同时他们站稳了工人阶级的立场，这种脑筋是对社会主义有利的，我们正培养着（特别在工农子弟中培养）这一种知识分子。另一种是旧知识分子的脑筋，撇开极端反动的右派分子的脑筋不说，像我们这些愿意改造思想的一般知识分子，也还有资产阶级的思想残余盘据在脑子里，这些思想残余经常企图在脑子里复辟。这种复杂情况就不免带着很大的危险性。因此我们不但不能以脑筋复杂自豪，还应该以脑筋复杂来警惕自己。
    社会主义社会的知识分子应该具有工人阶级的思想感情。有了这种思想感情，就可以大“鸣”大“放”，帮助党进行整风，而毫无顾虑。有了这种思想感情，就能疾恶如仇，和右派分子进行坚决的斗争。在北京的时候，我知道了北京印刷一厂工人同志拒绝排印反动刊物的动人消息；最近我来到了青岛，又听说当少数右派学生在街上贴反动大字报的时候，被工人们严词责问。这种工人阶级的正义感，是值得我们钦佩的。工人们的思想感情最单纯，同时也最有价值。我们要向工人同志学习，首先要改造思想，使我们能具有工人阶级的思想感情。
