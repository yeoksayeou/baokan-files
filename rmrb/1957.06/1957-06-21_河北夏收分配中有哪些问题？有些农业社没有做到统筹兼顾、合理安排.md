Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Electric Dispatch: The majority of areas in Hebei Province are intensely harvesting wheat, and agricultural cooperatives in various localities have formulated or are in the process of formulating distribution plans. Among them, Handan Prefecture is progressing relatively quickly, with 90% of cooperatives having completed their plans by early June; although some prefectures started no later, more than half of the cooperatives have not yet completed theirs. The reasons for the varying speeds in formulating distribution plans, apart from differences in the timing of the seasons, are mainly whether the contradictions between the state, the collective, and the members in distribution have been earnestly implemented in accordance with the principle of overall consideration and reasonable arrangement.

The focal point of various issues in the distribution of agricultural cooperatives is how much to retain. This year, the retention ratios set by many cooperatives in Hebei Province are appropriate, taking into account the needs of collective production and members' consumption. However, the retention ratios of some cooperatives are excessively high. According to a survey of 310 cooperatives in four counties, including Gucheng and Wuqiang, 68% of the cooperatives have retention ratios of more than 40% of total income, with some as high as 50%. There are also some cooperatives that, focusing only on the members' desire for more distribution, retain very little, making it impossible to support the need to strive for increased autumn production. Da Ducheng Cooperative in Neiqiu County is like this; it produces a lot of wheat but retains only 20.8% of the total income. After paying public grain and leaving seeds, the necessary working capital is gone. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives have given priority to ensuring the payment of state levies in distribution; however, there are also some cooperatives that, although they have the conditions, have not planned to appropriately repay some of the state loans and members' discounted shares in production materials. These incorrect distribution plans have now attracted attention.

Due to the division of large cooperatives into smaller ones, and due to some cooperatives implementing a system of contracted production with rewards for exceeding quotas for production teams, the contradictions between cooperatives and teams and between teams and teams in the summer harvest distribution have greatly eased; however, some problems remain. Although some cooperatives have implemented contracted work and production, because wheat production has decreased or because they have implemented a total contracted work and production system for all crops throughout the year, they have neglected to reward teams that have managed wheat well, causing poor relations between cooperatives and teams and between teams and teams.

Another problem is what to do about the imbalance in members' work attendance, and the issue of some households having very little income. In Qianchangyang Cooperative in Renqiu County, members who worked less than five labor days accounted for 14% of the total number of households. Now, this cooperative has made arrangements for these households based on the principle of combining remuneration according to work, mutual assistance and mutual support, and appropriate consideration. However, this issue has not been universally noticed.

In addition, whether the subsidies for cooperative cadres are appropriate in the distribution is also a matter of common concern to the vast number of cooperative members and cooperative cadres.

With past distribution experience, Hebei Province has universally implemented consultation with cooperative members and strengthened ideological work this time, so the distribution work will definitely be done better than in the past.

　　河北夏收分配中有哪些问题？
　　有些农业社没有做到统筹兼顾、合理安排
    据新华社保定电　河北省大部地区都在紧张地收割小麦，各地农业社都制订了或正在制订分配方案。其中进展较快的邯郸专区，到6月上旬已有90％的社作好了；有的专区虽然动手不晚，但还有半数以上的社没有作好。分配方案制订得有快有慢的原因，除季节有早有晚，主要还是对国家、社、社员在分配中的矛盾是否认真贯彻了统筹兼顾、合理安排的原则。
    农业社分配中各项问题的集中点是扣留多少。今年河北省许多社所订的扣留的比例是适当的，兼顾了集体生产的需要和社员的消费。但也有部分社的扣留比例却又过大了。据故城、武强等四县三百一十个社的调查，68％的社的扣留比例都在总收入的40％以上，有的多达50％。也有另一些社只从社员多分的要求出发，扣留很少，无法支持争取秋季增产的需要。内丘县大都成社就是这样，它产麦不少，只从总收入中扣留了20.8％，缴纳公粮和留下种子后，必需的流动资金就没有了。此外，许多农业社在分配中都尽先保证了缴纳国家的征收；但也有一些社虽然有条件，却对国家贷款和社员折价入社的生产资料没有计划适当的偿还一些。这些不正确的分配方案现在已引起了注意。
    由于大社分小了，由于一些社对生产队实行了包产超额奖励制度，在夏收分配中间的社队矛盾和队和队的矛盾大为缓和；但还有一些问题。有些社虽然实行了包工包产，但因为小麦减产或实行了全年各种作物的总合包工包产，没有实行小麦单项作物包工包产，忽视了对小麦经营好的队实行奖励，引起社和队、队和队关系不好。
    另一个问题是社员出工不平衡，有一些户收入很少的问题怎么办。任丘县前长洋社出工五个劳动日以下的社员占总户数的14％。现在这个社已本着按劳取酬和互助互济、适当照顾相结合的原则，对这些户作了安排。但是这个问题还未被普遍注意。
    此外，在分配中对社干部的补贴是否适当，也是广大社员和社干部共同关心的问题。
    有过去的分配经验，这次河北省又普遍实行了和社员商量并加强思想工作，这次分配工作肯定会作得比过去好。
