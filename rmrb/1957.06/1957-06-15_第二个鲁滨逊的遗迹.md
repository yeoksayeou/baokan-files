    The Remains of the Second Robinson
    British scholars have discovered the remains of the "second Robinson" – a Scotsman named Adam McCulloch – on a desert island in the Pacific.

    McCulloch lived on this island in the mid-nineteenth century. Deep within the island, the half-decayed small house where McCulloch lived and various daily necessities still remain. According to his diary, he decided to come to this tropical island in 1850 to seek peace.

    During World War II, a group of Japanese sailors drifted to this desert island and found a hiding place here. They lived in McCulloch's small house for nearly two months. When they sailed away, they left a letter in the small house stating that they had been to the island.

    第二个鲁滨逊的遗迹
    英国学者们在太平洋的一座荒岛上发现了“第二个鲁滨逊”——苏格兰人亚当·麦卡洛克的遗迹。
    麦卡洛克在十九世纪中叶在这座岛上住过。岛的深处至今还残存着麦卡洛克住过的一幢半腐朽小房和各种日常生活用具。据他的日记记载，他是在1850年决定到这个热带岛来寻找安宁的。
    第二次世界大战期间，一批日本水兵漂泊到这座荒岛上，在这里找到了藏身处所。他们在麦卡洛克的小房里住了将近两个月，以后他们渡海而去时，曾在小房中留下一封信，说明他们曾到过此岛。
