    Help the Party Run Medical Education Well
    Zhang Yun, Professor of China Union Medical College
    I have been engaged in medical education for decades and have taught at all kinds of higher medical schools. Based on my personal experience, during the rectification movement, I would like to offer some opinions on the current higher medical education work to help our Party run medical education well.
  Suggest Establishing a Medical Education Committee to Assist the Ministry of Health
    Since the national liberation, the implementation of He Cheng and Wang Bin's so-called "specialty focus system" and "image teaching method" in higher medical education has led us to take many detours and suffer many losses in cultivating advanced medical talents. It was not until more and more people raised opinions that modifications were proposed. However, due to the high demand for the number of doctors and the neglect of quality, a sharp contradiction between quality and quantity has been created in medical education, leading to a decline in the quality of medical students. In the past, the three basic links in teaching in better higher medical colleges—emphasis on basic sciences, emphasis on clinical practice, and emphasis on basic operations and independent thinking in internships—have been completely ignored. The physicians trained in this way are not only unable to improve China's medical science, but also have problems in correctly mastering diagnostic and treatment techniques. Therefore, I believe that the most important contradiction in medical education today is the contradiction between quality and quantity, and the Ministry of Health has not paid enough attention to this aspect in its leadership of medical education in recent years.
    At the same time, there are still many problems in the current medical education in terms of specialties, department settings, and the length of schooling, which also affect the training of medical talents. I think these issues should be well studied. Some people have suggested setting up a Medical Education Committee to assist the Ministry of Health, which may be better than the Ministry of Health doing medical education behind closed doors.
    The Future Direction of Peking Union Medical College Cannot Waver Anymore
    As for the issue of Peking Union Medical College, I think Peking Union Medical College has had some experience in cultivating advanced medical talents in the past, and it attached great importance to training in basic sciences, clinical practice, and laboratory work. Therefore, graduates of Peking Union Medical College have played a certain role in medical positions. In academic research, some aspects have reached the world level in the past. However, after Peking Union Medical College was taken over by the Military Commission after liberation, the direction wavered. First, it focused on medical treatment, making clinicians busy with diagnostic and treatment affairs all day long. Later, a large number of medical workers from the military who had not received formal training were transferred to Peking Union Medical College for further study. As a result, the strength of the professors and experts of Peking Union Medical College was dispersed. In this way, not only has there been no good improvement in medical technology, but also there has been no due development in academic research. This situation of only using but not developing should be the responsibility of the Health Department of the Military Commission.
    Now, I am not advocating that the current Peking Union Medical College should completely return to the old Peking Union Medical College, because that cannot solve the problem of cultivating medical talents nationwide today. Therefore, we should not only proceed from solving the problem of Peking Union Medical College, but also consider it from the perspective of solving the medical problems nationwide.
    However, the future development direction of Peking Union Medical College must not waver anymore. Peking Union Medical College has relatively good conditions and foundation, and it should be well used and arranged in terms of teaching, scientific research, and medical treatment.
    Regarding the relationship between the Party and the masses in Peking Union Medical College, my personal experience is that it is generally good, but it cannot be said that there are no gaps. After Peking Union Medical College was taken over, many comrades from the military came. Their lifestyles were not very similar to ours, and we rarely talked heart-to-heart. Although there were no major problems, the relationship was not very harmonious. In recent years, I feel that the Party members are very polite to us old professors and can generally respect our opinions. A secretary comrade who worked with me was a Party member, and we cooperated very well, and he respected my opinions very much. Comrades from the political department often talked to me, so I didn't feel that there was a high wall between the Party and us. This may be because the Party is particularly polite to senior intellectuals, so we feel that there is less separation between the Party and the masses. But for the general public, according to the big-character posters, there is still considerable estrangement. Some people feel that the Party's united front work is united with the upper levels but not with the lower levels. The comrades below have this feeling, and everyone's experience is different.
    I think there are more than 10 million Party members, and it is impossible for every Party member to have a high level of Marxism-Leninism. There are also people with low political awareness, arrogance, complacency, and other erroneous ideas and styles. Therefore, some mistakes within the Party are inevitable. I think the Party should strengthen ideological education for lower-level Party members so that they can truly become worthy Communist Party members.
    Finally, I would like to talk about my experience in this rectification movement. I think this rectification movement is to solve a part of the contradictions among the people, not all of them. Because in the rectification movement, non-Party comrades put forward opinions to the Party organizations and Party members, exposing their shortcomings and helping them improve their work style. In fact, there are also contradictions among the masses, and there are also contradictions among other parties. These contradictions and problems should also be resolved. Why is the rectification movement only rectifying the ideological style within the Party? My understanding is that because the Communist Party is now the ruling party, leading the people of the whole country in building socialism, if the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism within the Party are not eliminated, the harm will be greater. Conversely, if the Party itself overcomes these shortcomings, it will have the strength to help the masses and help various democratic parties to solve various contradictions. Therefore, I feel that this rectification movement is the main link in solving the contradictions among the people.
    With the Weapons of Criticism and Self-Criticism and the Supervision of the Masses, the Communist Party Will Never Fail
    The development of the rectification movement has given me many feelings, because in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, we have never seen any political party with such a great capacity to correct its shortcomings through the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Only the Communist Party can do this. I think the reason why the Communist Party will not be corrupted and will not fail is inseparable from its ability to firmly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and to promptly criticize and correct its shortcomings. I remember when Beijing was just liberated, I knew very little about the Party. I only knew that the Communist Party loved the people and was connected to the masses. But at the same time, I doubted whether the Communist Party, after gaining great power, would also fail due to the enjoyment and corruption of cadres, just like some dynasties in history. After several years of realistic education, I gradually realized that the Communist Party has mass supervision and will never be corrupted or fail. This rectification movement has made me further realize the significance of mass supervision and the importance of mastering the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. With this weapon, we can help the Party overcome its shortcomings and prevent the Party from rusting. I feel that although the rectification movement has exposed many shortcomings and mistakes of Party organizations and Party cadres, as long as Party organizations and Party members can earnestly correct their shortcomings and resolutely overcome the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in their ideological style, then the Party's prestige among the masses will not be reduced, but will be further enhanced, and the people will be more firmly united around the Party.

### 帮助党办好医学教育

    帮助党办好医学教育
    中国协和医学院教授　张鋆
    我从事医学教育几十年了，各样的高等医学校我都教过。根据我亲身的体会，在整风运动中，我想对目前的高等医学教育工作提些意见，帮助我们的党办好医学教育。
  建议设立医学教育委员会来协助卫生部工作
    全国解放以来，由于推行了贺诚、王斌的一套所谓“专科重点制”、“形象教学法”的高等医学教育制度和方法，使我们在培养高级医学人才方面走了不少弯路和受了不少损失。直到后来大家提意见多了，才提出来修改，但是由于对医师数量的要求高而忽略了对质量的要求，造成了医学教育中质与量的尖锐矛盾，以致医学生质量下降。过去比较好的高等医学院中教学上三个基本环节：重基础科学、重临床实习和重实习课中的基本操作与独立思考，都完全被忽视了，这样造就出来的医师不但不能提高中国的医学科学，即在正确掌握诊疗技术上亦有问题。因此，我认为目前医学教育中最主要的矛盾，就是质与量的矛盾，而卫生部这几年在医学教育的领导上，对这方面还没有很好注意。
    同时目前的医学教育中的专业、学系的设置以及学制等还存在着许多问题，也影响着医学人才的培养。我认为这些问题都应该很好地研究。有人建议设医学教育委员会来协助卫生部工作，这可能比卫生部自己关起门来搞医学教育要好一些。
    协和医学院今后的方针不能再摇摆了
    至于谈到协和的问题，我认为协和医学院过去在培养高级医学人才方面还是有一定经验的，在基础科学、临床实习和实验室工作的训练上是十分重视的，因此协和的毕业生在医学岗位上是起到一定的作用的。在学术研究上，过去有的方面也曾达到世界水平。但是协和在解放后由军委接管以后，方针摇摆不定，先是抓医疗为重点，使临床医师整天忙于诊疗事务，后来又调来一大批没有受过正规训练的部队上的医务工作者到协和进修，因此把协和的教授、专家们的力量的使用都分散了，这样不但在医疗技术上没有得到很好的提高，就是在学术研究上也没有得到应有的发展。这种只使用不发展的情况是应由军委卫生部负责的。
    现在我也并不是赞成把现在的协和完全回到过去老协和的路上去，因为那样并不能很好地解决今天全国医学人才的培养问题。因此，现在不能光从解决协和的问题出发，而要从解决全国医学的问题来考虑。
    但是对协和今后发展的方针，一定不能再摇摆了。协和的条件和基础是比较好的，不管是在教学和科学研究方面，或是医疗方面，都是应当很好地使用和安排的。
    关于协和医学院的党群关系方面，我个人的体会觉得一般还是不错的，但是也不能说没有隔阂。协和接管后，来了很多部队的同志，他们和我们的生活习惯不大相同，谈心也很少，虽然没有什么大问题，但关系是不大融洽的。这几年来我觉得党员同志对我们这些老教授很客气，一般能尊重我们的意见。和我一齐工作的一位秘书同志是个党员，就和我合作得很好，对我的意见很尊重。政治部的同志们有时也常找我谈谈话，因而不觉得党和我们有什么高墙隔着。这或者是党对高级知识分子特别客气，因而使我们感到党群之间的隔阂较少。但对一般群众，据大字报所揭露，还是有相当的隔膜的。有人就觉得党的统战工作是统上不统下，下面同志就有这种感觉，各人的体会是不同的。
    我觉得党员有一千多万，不可能每个党员的马列主义修养都很高，其中也有政治觉悟低、有骄傲自满等错误思想和作风的人，因此党内有些错误也是难免的。我认为党应当加强对下级党员的思想教育，使他们真正成为名副其实的共产党员。
    最后我谈一下关于这次整风运动的体会，我认为这次整风运动是解决人民内部的一部分矛盾，而不是解决全部矛盾。因为整风运动中是非党同志对党组织、党员提意见，揭露他们的缺点，帮助他们改进作风。其实群众之间也有矛盾，其他党派之间也有矛盾，这些矛盾、问题也应该解决。为什么整风运动就是整党内的思想作风？我的体会是，因共产党现在是执政的党，领导着全国人民建设社会主义，如果党内的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义不整掉，危害性更大；相反，党本身克服了这些缺点，就有力量去帮助群众、帮助各民主党派去解决各种矛盾。因此，我体会这次整风运动是解决人民内部矛盾的主要环节。
    有批评与自我批评的武器，有群众的监督，共产党永远不会失败
    整风运动的开展使我有很多感想，因为古今中外，我们还没有看见过任何一个政党有这样大的气量，能通过批评与自我批评的武器来改正自己的缺点，只有共产党才能做到这点。我认为共产党所以不会腐化，不会失败，是和它能坚决掌握批评与自我批评这一武器，能及时批判和改正自己的缺点分不开的。记得北京刚解放时，我对党还了解得很少，只知道共产党是爱护人民、联系群众的，但同时也怀疑共产党掌握了大权会不会也像历史上一些朝代一样，由于干部的享乐腐化而致失败。经过几年来现实的教育，我逐步认识到，共产党有群众监督，永远不会腐化，不会失败。这次整风运动使我进一步体会到群众监督的意义，掌握批评与自我批评武器的重要。有了这个武器，就能帮助党克服缺点，使党不会生锈。我觉得在整风运动中虽然揭露了党组织和党员干部的不少缺点和错误，但是只要党组织和党员能认真地改正自己的缺点，坚决克服思想作风中的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，那末党在群众中的威信不是降低了，而是更提高了，人民群众会更加巩固地团结在党的周围。
