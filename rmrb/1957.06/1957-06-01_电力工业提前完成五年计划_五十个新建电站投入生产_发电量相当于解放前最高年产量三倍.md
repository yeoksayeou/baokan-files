Xinhua News Agency, May 31st - According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, as of May 20 this year, China's cumulative annual power generation has exceeded the 1957 power generation target stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by 1.6%. Calculated based on the time of reaching the 1957 level, the national First Five-Year Plan for power generation was completed in April (calculated based on comparable power generation in the First Five-Year Plan). Prior to this, the three main indicators marking the technical level of power industry production—plant power consumption rate, line loss rate, and coal consumption rate—had all reached the original 1957 levels as early as last year.

In the year from May 21 last year to May 20 this year, the national power industry generated a total of 17.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours over the total power generation in 1952, equivalent to three times the highest annual output before liberation (1941).

The rapid development of capital construction in the power industry in recent years is an important reason for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan for national power generation. From 1953 to the end of last year, fifty new power stations nationwide above the quota limit had been fully or partially put into production. Together with small power plants below the quota limit, the total capacity of all power generation equipment increased from 1.9 million kilowatts in 1952 to 3.61 million kilowatts. In other words, the newly added power generation equipment in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan was close to the total power generation capacity achieved in the sixty-seven years from 1882 when a small power plant was first established in Shanghai to the eve of liberation (1.85 million kilowatts).

Due to the establishment of these new power stations, many new industrial cities in China, such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Chongqing, and Wuhan, now have modern large or medium-sized power stations. Moreover, even in remote minority areas, electricity has begun to be used for production and lighting. For example, the original few small power plants in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had a total power generation capacity of only over 2,000 kilowatts. After building some new power plants in recent years, the power generation capacity has increased eleven times compared to the past. The power generation capacity of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also increased three times compared to 1949.

The production potential of many existing power plants has also been more fully utilized in recent years. According to statistics from the various plants under the Ministry of Power Industry, which account for more than 80% of the country's power generation, the utilization hours of power generation equipment in 1956 increased from 4,400 hours in 1952 to 4,883 hours, which is 333 hours more than the 1957 target set by the First Five-Year Plan. Therefore, based on this calculation alone, state-owned power plants generated 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours more electricity last year than in 1952.

In addition, various localities have also tapped considerable potential in actively repairing dilapidated equipment and increasing the output of existing equipment in old power plants. Among them, calculated only for state-owned power plants, the increased production capacity due to the above measures is equivalent to one-fifth of the capacity of all old equipment.

### 电力工业提前完成五年计划  五十个新建电站投入生产  发电量相当于解放前最高年产量三倍

    电力工业提前完成五年计划
    五十个新建电站投入生产
    发电量相当于解放前最高年产量三倍
    新华社31日讯　据国家统计局初步统计，到今年5月20日为止，我国累计一年的发电量已经超过第一个五年计划中规定的1957年发电量1.6％。如按照达到1957年水平的时间计算，全国第一个五年的发电量计划在4月份就完成了（以上按第一个五年计划可比的发电量计算）。在此以前，标志着电力工业生产技术水平的厂用电率、线路损失率和煤耗率三个主要指标，早在去年就都达到了原规定的1957年水平。
    从去年5月21日到今年5月20日的一年中，全国电力工业总计生产了一百七十八亿度电力，比1952年全年发电量增加一百多亿度，相当于解放前最高年（1941年）产量的三倍。
    几年来电力工业基本建设的迅速发展是全国发电量提前完成五年计划的重要原因。从1953年起到去年年底为止，全国仅是限额以上的新建电站，就有五十个全部或部分投入生产，加上限额以下的小电厂，全部发电设备的容量从1952年的一百九十万瓩增加到了三百六十一万瓩，即第一个五年计划前四年新增加的发电设备，就接近于我国自1882年在上海开始建立一个小电厂起到解放前夕六十七年内所达到的全部发电能力（一百八十五万瓩）。
    由于这些新电站的建立，目前我国不但许多新工业城市，如西安、兰州、郑州、洛阳、重庆、武汉等地都有了现代化的大型或中型电站，并且在边远的少数民族地区，也都开始利用电力来生产和照明了。例如新疆维吾尔自治区解放前原有的几个小电厂，总共发电能力也不过二千多瓩，几年来建设了一些新电厂以后，发电能力比过去增加了十一倍。内蒙古自治区的发电能力，也比1949年增加了三倍。
    许多旧有电厂的生产潜力这几年来也都得到较充分的发挥。据占全国发电量80％以上的电力工业部所属各厂的统计，1956年发电设备的利用小时已经从1952年的四千四百小时提高到四千八百八十三小时，比第一个五年计划规定的1957年指标还多了三百三十三小时。因此，单就这一项计算，各国营电厂去年一年就比1952年多发了十一亿度电。
    另外，各地旧有电厂在积极修复破旧设备和提高原有设备出力方面，也都挖掘出了不少潜力，其中只就国营电厂计算，由于采取上述措施而增加的生产能力，相等全部旧有设备能力的五分之一。
