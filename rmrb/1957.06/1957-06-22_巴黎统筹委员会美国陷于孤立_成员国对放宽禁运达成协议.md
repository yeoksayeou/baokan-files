Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 21st: News from Paris: The so-called Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM), based in Paris, reached an agreement on June 20th on the general principles of easing trade restrictions with China. The committee will now begin to specify the special limits on certain types of goods in trade with China. In the past, these goods were prohibited from being sold to China, but only had quantitative restrictions when sold to other socialist countries.

Until now, almost all member states of COCOM have followed the example of the United Kingdom in relaxing their trade restrictions with China to the same level as those imposed on other socialist countries. Only Turkey still follows the United States in taking a reserved attitude. In this situation, the United States has had to give in.

　　巴黎统筹委员会美国陷于孤立
    成员国对放宽禁运达成协议
    新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：设在巴黎的所谓出口管制统筹委员会20日已经就对中国贸易限制的一般原则达成协议。这个委员会现在将着手规定对中国贸易中某类货物的特别限额。这些货物在过去是禁止卖给中国的，但是对其他社会主义国家则只是在数量上有所限制。
    到目前为止，统筹委员会里几乎所有成员国都仿效了英国，把它们对中国的贸易限制放宽得同对其它社会主义国家的限制一样，只有土耳其仍然追随美国，采取保留态度。在这种情况下，美国也就只好让步。
