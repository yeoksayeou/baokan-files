　　The Soviet Union is Actively Carrying Out Economic Management Restructuring
　　National Economic Committees in Some Economic Zones Have Begun Work
　　Trade Union Organizations Prepare to Reorganize to Adapt to New Situation
　　This newspaper reports that at present, all parts of the Soviet Union are actively implementing the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on restructuring the economic management system. Not only have the republics successively determined the division of economic administrative regions, but also the National Economic Committees responsible for leading industry and construction have been established and started work in some economic administrative regions.
　　The National Economic Committee of the Kiev Economic Administrative Region of the Ukrainian Republic has already started operations. It leads more than 500 industrial enterprises through thirteen specialized administrative bureaus, and the total output value of these enterprises reaches more than 18 billion rubles per year. In addition to industrial enterprises, the National Economic Committee also leads 53 construction organizations, 30 scientific research institutes, and design agencies. The initial work of the National Economic Committee mainly focuses on ensuring comprehensive leadership over industry. At the same time, it strives to widely promote mass enthusiasm in its affiliated enterprises to create conditions for technological progress. At present, production organization is being further improved in various enterprises.
　　The Belorussian Republic is a single economic administrative region. Its National Economic Committee has been established with thirteen specialized administrative bureaus and eleven sections under it. The National Economic Committee generally leads enterprises directly through the administrative bureaus, with only four administrative bureaus having established intermediate institutions—trusts. The staffing of the National Economic Committee has also been determined to be 250 people. The National Economic Committee has also established a special team to inventory existing materials, calculate the supply needs of enterprises, etc. In order to do a good job in connecting with other economic administrative regions, the National Economic Committee has also sent people to Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, and other places. Internal organizational work is also being further improved within enterprises. For example, the Minsk Automobile Factory has merged some small workshops, thereby freeing up more than 20 engineering and technical personnel.
　　The Chita Oblast of the Russian Federation is an economic administrative region, and its National Economic Committee is being established. Approximately 300 industrial enterprises and construction projects will be led by the National Economic Committee. Some enterprises in this economic administrative region have begun restructuring, especially mining industrial enterprises. Enterprises originally belonging to trusts and joint companies have all been placed under the direct management of the National Economic Committee; at the same time, some mining sites with similar properties and close distances have been merged. In addition, in the past, there were 90 geological exploration teams within the territory of Chita Oblast that belonged to various ministries and competent authorities. Now, these exploration teams will be uniformly led by the Geological Bureau established by the National Economic Committee.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 18th. With the change in the form of industrial and construction management, the Soviet trade union organization will also undergo a major reorganization. The plenary session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, which opened in Moscow on the 13th, is discussing this issue and will make corresponding decisions.
　　Before the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions held this meeting, workers and trade union organizations throughout the Soviet Union had already conducted heated discussions on the issue of improving the organizational work of trade unions. In the discussions, many suggestions were put forward from various places.
　　Regarding how to reorganize, the opinions put forward by workers and trade union organizations in various places can be basically summarized into two main viewpoints. The first view holds that the existing dozens of industrial trade unions should be abolished and unified workers' and employees' trade unions should be established. This would reduce the levels and institutions of trade union organizations, making them compatible with the economic administrative regions divided after industrial restructuring, thereby enabling higher-level trade unions to directly and flexibly lead grass-roots trade union organizations. However, the vast majority of people disagree with this view, believing that reorganizing trade unions according to this plan violates Lenin's principle of organizing trade unions according to production departments and would essentially lead to the abolition of trade union organizations. They advocate preserving the existing industrial trade unions, merging some industrial trade unions with similar characteristics, and at the same time decentralizing power to strengthen the power and role of local trade union organizations. However, there is no consensus on how to strengthen the role of trade union councils at all levels and expand the authority of lower-level trade union organizations.
　　Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, pointed out in his report at this meeting of the Central Council of Trade Unions that this reorganization of Soviet trade unions will be carried out on the basis of democratic centralism in accordance with the principle of organizing trade unions according to production departments. The Presidium of the Central Council proposed merging some of the current 47 industrial trade unions to form 18 industrial trade unions. Grishin said that the multi-layered leadership of trade unions does not help the initiative of local organizations and causes unnecessary over-concentration of leadership. This situation will be changed after this reorganization.
　　The plenary session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions is now discussing Grishin's report.

### 苏联经济管理改组工作积极进行  一些经济区的国民经委会已开始工作  工会组织准备进行改组以适应新情况

　　苏联经济管理改组工作积极进行
　　一些经济区的国民经委会已开始工作
　　工会组织准备进行改组以适应新情况
    本报讯　目前苏联各地正积极贯彻苏联最高苏维埃关于改组经济管理制度的决议。各共和国不但已相继确定了经济行政区的划分，而且负责领导工业和建设的国民经济委员会已在一些经济行政区内成立起来，开始工作。
    乌克兰共和国基辅经济行政区的国民经济委员会已经开始办公。它通过十三个专业管理局来领导五百多个工业企业，这些企业的总产值一年达一百八十亿卢布以上。除工业企业外，国民经济委员会还领导五十三个建设组织、三十个科学研究所和设计机关。国民经济委员会的初步工作，主要是注意保证对工业的全面领导。同时，努力在所属各企业中广泛发扬群众积极性为争取技术进步创造条件。在各企业中，目前正在进一步改善生产组织。
    白俄罗斯共和国是一个单一的经济行政区。它的国民经济委员会已成立，下属有十三个专业管理局和十一个处。国民经济委员会一般是通过管理局来直接领导企业，只有四个管理局下建立了中间机构——托辣斯。国民经济委员会的编制也已确定为二百五十人。国民经济委员会还成立了一个专门小组，来清理现存物资、计算企业的供应需要等。为了做好同其他经济行政区的联系工作，国民经济委员会还派人前赴莫斯科、基辅、列宁格勒等地。各企业内部也在进一步改进组织工作。例如，明斯克汽车制造厂已把一些小车间合并，从而解放出二十多个工程技术人员。
    俄罗斯联邦的赤塔州是一个经济行政区，它的国民经济委员会正在建立中，将有约三百个工业企业和建设由国民经济委员会来领导。这个经济行政区的一些企业已着手改组，特别是采矿工业企业，原先属于托辣斯和联合公司的一些企业，已全部划归国民经济委员会直接管理；同时一些性质相近、距离也近的采矿场已经合并。此外，过去赤塔州境内有九十个分属于各部和主管机关的地质勘探队，现在，这些勘探队将统一由国民经济委员会所设的地质管理局领导。
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　随着工业和建设管理形式的改变，苏联工会组织也将进行重大的改组。13日在莫斯科开幕的全苏工会中央理事会全体会议正在就这个问题进行讨论，并且将作出相应的决定。
    在全苏工会中央理事会举行这次会议以前，苏联各地职工和工会组织已经对改进工会的组织工作的问题进行了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，各地提出了许多建议。
    关于如何改组的问题，各地职工和工会组织提出的意见基本上可以归纳为两种主张。第一种主张认为，应该取消现有的几十个产业工会而成立统一的工人和职员工会。这样作就可以减少工会组织的层次和机构，使它同工业改组后划分的经济行政区相适应，从而使得上级工会有可能直接地和灵活地领导基层工会组织。但是，绝大多数人不同意这种主张，他们认为，根据这种方案来改组工会是同列宁的关于按生产部门组织工会的原则相违背的，实质上会导致工会组织的取消。他们主张保存现有的产业工会，而把一些性质相近的产业工会合并，同时把重心下放，以加强工会的地方组织的权力和作用。不过，关于如何加强各级工会理事会的作用和扩大下层工会组织的权限的问题，还没有一致的意见。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在工会中央理事会这一次会议上作报告时指出，苏联工会的这次改组将根据按生产部门组织工会的原则在民主集中制的基础上进行。中央理事会主席团建议把现在的四十七个产业工会中的一些工会合并，而成立十八个产业工会。格里申说，工会的多层领导无助于地方组织积极性的发挥，并且造成领导不必要的过分集中。经过这次改组，就将改变这种情形。
    全苏工会中央理事会全体会议现在正在讨论格里申的报告。
