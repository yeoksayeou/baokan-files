　　Tujia Children in the Library

　　No matter which direction you come from to Yao Dong, you have to cross several rapids and climb high, steep mountains. The uphill road, several miles long, looks like a thin belt pulled straight down from the mountaintop. Standing on the cliff, I wiped my sweat and continued to rush towards Yao Dong along the mountain road.
　　On the mountainside, I met an old woman carrying her grandson and herding cattle. She shouted loudly: "Comrade, where are you from? Are you a teacher, or a health worker? (referring to medical personnel)" I replied that I was going to see the Yao Dong School. The old woman smiled, her smile so kind.
　　It was noon when I entered Yao Dong Village.
　　Facing us was a large white sign with the words "Baojing County Yao Dong Complete Primary School" ("Yao Dong" is also written as "Yao Dong"). It happened to be a break between classes, and the children were playing on the flat ground, some bouncing balls, some skipping ropes, some playing cards, and some huddled together reading picture books. The red scarves around their necks were bright red in the sunlight, really beautiful. The four Tujia teachers and three Han teachers were all resting in the middle main room. The youngest was the principal, named Peng Peichun, a Tujia Communist Youth League member. We received a warm welcome.
　　We stayed at the primary school that day. At dusk, the principal led us for a walk around the village. He pointed to the south and said:
　　"Do you see those two vaguely visible mountain peaks in the clouds? Many students live at the foot of those mountains, and they run fourteen or fifteen miles of mountain roads to study every day. Of the two hundred and twenty-six students in the school, besides those from Yao Dong and Tu Ba villages, most walk at least eight or nine miles to school every day. Therefore, we start classes later and dismiss school earlier, so that the children don't have to climb steep slopes in the dark." He also asked us to look at the high mountain in the east: "That is Immortal Rock, more than 1,300 meters above sea level. From the village on the other side of the rock, it takes climbing thirty miles of steep slopes to get here. To the right of Immortal Rock there is also Mi Xi Village, twenty-five miles away, and it takes crossing forty-two rivers to get here. We have a dozen or so high primary school students from Mi Xi and Xian Ren villages who have to live with the teachers and only go home during winter and summer vacations."
　　I asked curiously: "Do children who have to travel long distances every day refuse to go to school?"
　　The principal shook his head and smiled: "Don't look down on them just because they are young, they can run dozens of miles barefoot. They come wearing straw hats even when it's windy and snowing. When it's busy farming season, the adults go to work in the fields. Some villages don't have nurseries, so dozens of students carry their younger siblings on their backs and travel long distances to school. They put their siblings next to them during class, and play with them after class."
　　In the evening, I was flipping through the primary school students' homework when an old woman in her sixties walked in. She smiled at the teachers as casually as if she were back in her own home, and started talking to people. It is said that the elderly people in this village have a habit of coming to the primary school when they have nothing to do, sitting and smoking two bowls of dry tobacco, chatting with the teachers, or listening to the children read aloud. This widowed old woman, Liang Xiangshi, a "Five Guarantees Household" in the Yao Dong Agricultural Cooperative, comes even more often.
　　I asked her: "Do you like this school?"
　　"Oh, need you even ask? It's the first time in thousands of years that a village has a school. There used to be only one private school, teaching the Three Character Classic and the Daughters' Classic. It cost two or three dou of rice (one dou is thirty-five catties) a year, plus oil, salt, firewood, and tobacco. That teacher was really mean, hitting people every day. The girls in the village were afraid of being beaten and didn't have rice, so they didn't go to school." She pointed to the teacher who was correcting homework under the oil lamp and said: "They don't hit or scold, and they don't ask for anything. Poor children can all go to school now."
　　I heard that there are many folk singers and singing masters in rural Xiangxi. They can't read a single word, but they can be inspired by the scenery and compose and sing as they go. I wondered if this old woman was a folk singer, so I tentatively asked: "Granny, how about you compose a few songs about this primary school?" Sure enough, she could sing. She smiled and said: "I can't sing well." After saying that, she tilted her head and thought for a moment, and then began to sing:
　　"Confucius often traveled around the state of Lu,
　　Pushing a cart day and night in the land,
　　Soviet-made books spread throughout the world,
　　Tujia children sit in the library."
　　After singing, she pointed to the books on the table and said: "Aren't these good books all passed down from the Soviet Union?" The director of teaching, sitting beside her, smiled and said to me: "She means that Marxism-Leninism is spreading throughout the world!"
　　The next morning after breakfast, several gray-haired Tujia elders came, all in their seventies and eighties. We asked the elders to talk about the Tujia customs, historical stories, and their living conditions. As we talked, the topic turned to the primary school again. The elders said that this place used to be a hillside. When the people of Yao Dong and nearby Lang Luo and Ba Ji villages heard that a school was going to be built, they were overjoyed. They contributed more than three thousand workdays in total, leveling the hillside at once. Some donated wood, some cut down trees, and some carried tiles, building the house frame. They didn't stop working even when it rained and the wind blew. The government also allocated two hundred yuan to hire tile makers and carpenters, and the school building was quickly built.
　　To the left of the school is a garden, with beans, sweet potatoes, and corn growing very well. Teacher Long, the Young Pioneer instructor, told me that these were planted by the primary school students in each class, and the vegetable garden a little further away belongs to the Young Pioneers. There are one hundred and seven Young Pioneers in the school. In addition to telling stories, playing games, singing, and dancing on their team days, they also work together. Last year, they harvested a lot of peppers and corn, which everyone was very happy about.
　　I asked the instructor if the day students participated in household labor. Just then, the principal walked over and answered casually: "There are more than two hundred students in our school, eleven of whom are Miao and the rest are Tujia. They are stubborn, hardworking, and thrifty, and love to work. The school usually pays attention to education about the glory of labor. Most primary school students go to herd cattle and collect manure early in the morning before eating breakfast and going to school. After school, they help their mothers cook, carry water, and carry babies on their backs. On Sundays, they chop firewood and cut grass for cattle and pigs—they do everything. All primary school students over the age of ten participate in the production of agricultural cooperatives during winter and summer vacations."
　　At this time, the third class was in session. The principal took me into the group of children, and a child who was playing gleefully suddenly ran into me. This child was small, looking no more than thirteen years old. At this time, he was panting, with an embarrassed expression on his face. The principal laughed and scolded him, and then turned to me and said: "His name is Zhang Jiayi. He cuts grass for cattle, carries manure, and accumulates fertilizer in the agricultural cooperative. Last summer vacation, he earned one hundred and eighty work points in the cooperative!" I patted him on the shoulder, and just as I was about to say a few words of praise, the class bell rang, and Zhang Jiayi and his friends rushed into the classroom like a swarm of bees.

　　土家儿女坐书楼
　　程竞明
    不管从哪个方向到尧洞去，都要过几道急湍的河水，再翻又高又陡的大山。好几里长的上坡路，像是从山顶笔直拖下来的一条细腰带。站在悬崖之上，我擦了擦汗水，继续顺着山路朝尧洞奔。
    在半山腰，遇见一个老婆婆，背着小孙子在放牛。她大声喊道：“同志，打哪里来呀？你们是老师，还是卫生？（指医务人员）”我回说，是去看尧洞学校的。老婆婆笑了，笑得那么慈祥。
    走进尧洞村，已经中午。
    迎面一块大白牌，上写“保靖县尧东完全小学校”一行字（“尧洞”又写作“尧东”）。碰巧是下课休息，孩子们在坪台上玩耍，有的拍皮球，有的跳绳子，有的打扑克，还有挤在一起看小人书的。他们脖子上的红领巾，在阳光下红艳艳的，实在好看。四个土家族老师和三个汉族老师，全在中间大房里休息，那年纪最轻的是校长，叫彭培春，是个土家族共青团员。我们受到了热情的接待。
    这天，我们在小学校里住了下来。黄昏时候，校长领着我们在村前村后走了走。他指着南面说：
    “你们看见那云雾里模模糊糊的两个山尖吗？有不少学生就住在那山脚下，每天跑十四五里山路来念书。全校二百二十六个学生，除了尧洞、涂坝村的，少说也是每天走八九里路上学。所以我们上课晏，放学早，不让孩子摸黑爬陡坡。”他又叫我们看东边的高山：“那是仙人岩，拔海一千三百多公尺，从岩那边的村到这里，一上一下要爬三十里陡坡。仙人岩右面还有个米西村，隔这二十五里，到这里来要过四十二道河水。我们有十来个家在米西、仙人村的高小学生，只能和老师住在一起，放寒暑假才回家。”
    我好奇地问道：“小孩子家天天跑远道，有不肯上学的吧？”
    校长摇摇头，笑起来了：“别看他们年纪小，赤着脚丫子一跑几十里，刮风落雪，也戴着斗笠来。农忙的时候，大人下田干活了，有的村没有办托儿所，所以还有几十个学生背着小弟弟小妹妹赶远路上学。上课时把弟妹放在旁边，下了课就领他们玩。”
    晚上，我正在翻看小学生的作业，走进来一个六十多岁的老妇人。她仿佛是回到自己家里一样，很随便地对老师们笑了笑，便找人说起话来。据说，这个村里的老年人都有一种习惯，没有事情的时候，喜欢到小学校来坐坐，抽两锅旱烟，和老师们聊聊天，或是听听孩子们的朗读。这个孤寡老婆婆，是尧洞农业社的“五保户”梁向氏，更是来的勤。
    我问她：“你们喜欢这个学校吧？”
    “咳，那还用说吗？村里办学堂，几千年没有的事。从前只有一个私塾，学三字经，女儿经，一年要交两三斗米（一斗三十五斤），还有油、盐、柴、烟，那先生真恶，天天打人，村里的妹怕打，又没有米，都不上学。”她指着正在油灯下批改作业的老师说：“他们不打不骂，什么也不要，穷家儿女能个个上学堂了。”
    我听说，湘西农村有很多歌郎、歌娘和歌师父，他们一字不识，却能触景生情，随编随唱。心里自忖，这老婆婆不知是不是歌娘，便试探地问道：“婆，你把这小学校编几个歌唱唱，好不好？”果然她会唱。她笑道：“唱不好。”说完，偏着头想了一下，就唱起来了：
    “孔子常打鲁国游，
    日夜推车在九州，
    苏联造书传天下，
    土家儿女坐书楼。”
    唱完，她指着桌上的书本说：“这些好书不都是苏联传过来的吗？”坐在一旁的教导主任笑着对我说：“她指的是马列主义传天下咧！”
    第二天早饭过后，又有几个须发苍苍的土家族老人来了，都是七八十岁的人。我们便请老人谈谈土家族的风俗习惯、历史故事，和他们的生活状况。谈着谈着，话题又转到小学校上面来了。老人们说，这里原先是个山坡坡，尧洞和附近浪落、巴基村的人听说要办学校，高兴的了不得，总共出了三千多个工，一时把山包挖平了，有的献木料，有的砍树，有的背瓦，搭房架，落雨刮风也不肯停工，政府也拨了二百元请瓦匠、木工，很快就把校舍盖好了。
    学校左边有一片园地，豆子、红薯、包谷，长得很好。少先队的辅导员龙老师告诉我，这是各班小学生种的，再远一点的那块菜地是少先队的。学校有一百零七个红领巾，他们过队日除了讲故事、游戏、唱歌跳舞，还在一起劳动，去年收了好多辣椒、包谷，大家欢喜的很。
    我问辅导员，走读生是不是参加家庭劳动，正巧校长走过来，他顺口回答说：“我们学校二百多个学生，有十一个是苗族，其余都是土家族。他们性格倔强，勤恳俭朴，爱劳动，学校平时也很注意劳动光荣的教育。大部分小学生起清早就去放牛，拾粪肥，然后才吃早饭上学，散学回家都帮妈妈烧饭、担水、背娃娃，星期天砍柴、割牛草猪草——什么都干。凡是上了十岁的小学生，放寒暑假全都参加农业社的生产”。
    这时，正下第三堂课，校长带我走进孩子群里，一个在忘情嬉戏的孩子猛地和我撞个满怀。这孩子小小个儿，看上去不过十三岁上下。这时他喘息着，满脸尴尬的表情。校长笑着骂了一声，回头向我说：“他叫张家义，在农业社割牛草、背粪土、积肥，去年暑假在社里得了一百八十个工分呢！”我拍拍他的肩膀，正要说几句赞扬的话，上课铃响起来了，张家义和他的小伙伴们一窝蜂似地走进了课堂。
