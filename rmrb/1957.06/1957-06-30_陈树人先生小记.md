A Brief Note on Mr. Chen Shuren
　　He Xiangning
    Mr. Chen Shuren was a member of the Tongmenghui. In his early years, he followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to participate in the revolution, went to Japan and the Americas and Canada, presided over the American and Canadian branches of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and served as the Minister of Overseas Affairs. Some older overseas Chinese are familiar with him. During the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924, he opposed the right wing and worked hard to assist Liao Zhongkai, serving as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province.
    Mr. Chen Shuren worked in the old society for many years, but he was upright and honest, and his family had no savings after his death. Mr. Chen Shuren's son, Chen Fu, was a very diligent Communist Party member. He was arrested and sacrificed when Chen Jitang was in power in Guangdong. In his grief, Mr. Chen Shuren wrote a poem to mourn him, which contained the line "No longer my son, but my teacher." Mr. Chen also renamed the room where Chen Fu used to live "Thinking of Fu Building."
    Mr. Chen Shuren left behind the crystallization of his lifelong dedication to Chinese painting. The works exhibited at the Mr. Chen Shuren Memorial Painting Exhibition held in Beijing this time are his masterpieces. In addition, he had several masterpieces that were sold in Hong Kong in 1948, and the proceeds were used as funeral expenses for Mr. Chen Shuren. (Attached picture)

　　陈树人先生小记
　　何香凝
    陈树人先生是同盟会员。他早期跟随孙中山先生参加革命，到过日本及美洲加拿大各地，主持过中华革命党美洲加拿大总支部，曾任海外部长，海外有一部分老华侨对他是熟悉的。一九二四年国民党改组之时，他反对右派，并努力帮助廖仲恺工作，任广东省民政厅长。
    陈树人先生在旧社会工作多年，但为人耿直、清廉，死后家无余财。陈树人先生的儿子陈复，是一个很努力的共产党员，在陈济棠执政广东的时候被捕牺牲了，陈树人先生悲痛之余，写了一首诗悼念他，中有“已非吾子是吾师”之句。陈复从前住过的居室，陈先生也将它起名为“思复楼”。
    陈树人先生遗下了他一生从事国画艺术创作的结晶。这次在北京举行的陈树人先生遗画展览会上展出的作品，就是他的遗墨佳品。此外他还有几幅佳作，已于一九四八年在香港卖去，得款作为陈树人先生的治丧费了。（附图片）
