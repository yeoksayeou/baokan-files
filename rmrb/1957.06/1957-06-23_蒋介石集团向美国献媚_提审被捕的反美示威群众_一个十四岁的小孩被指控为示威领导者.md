    A Fourteen-Year-Old Child Accused of Being Demonstration Leader

    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Taipei Dispatch -- The Chiang Kai-shek clique has shockingly accused a fourteen-year-old child of being the leader of tens of thousands of anti-American demonstrators.

    During the court hearing on the 19th, two lower-ranking Kuomintang police officers "testified" that on the night of the demonstration, Zhang Hong "led rioters in three attempts to storm the police station, all of which failed." The news said that Zhang Hong is the son of a well-known doctor and is the youngest of the forty-one "defendants."

    Xinhua News Agency, Taipei Dispatch -- The Chiang Kai-shek clique's police authorities arrested one hundred and eleven patriotic people in the recent anti-American demonstration in Taiwan and have already "brought public charges" against forty-one of them.

    In addition, according to a United Press International Taipei dispatch on the 15th, the Kuomintang will allocate one million U.S. dollars as compensation to the United States for the anti-American demonstration.
