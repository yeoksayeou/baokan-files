What kind of talk.

Are the People the Masters of the Country, or Slaves?
Excerpts from a Speech by Qu Beiwei, Member of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, at the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference

　　Today, the concentrated manifestation of contradictions among the people in our country is the contradiction between the leaders and the led. The essence of this contradiction is the contradiction between the Party and non-Party members. In the past few years, the growth and development of the bad ideological styles of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism within the Communist Party have made the contradictions among the people unprecedentedly acute.

　　I very much doubt whether "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people" or whether all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the Communist Party? Is the Communist Party serving the people, or are the people serving the Communist Party? Are Communist Party members the servants of the people, or the rulers of the people? Are the people the masters of the country, or slaves?

　　As long as one is a Communist Party member, special consideration is given to work, position, treatment, and life. Sectarianism is rampant everywhere. Faced with this reality, I have this feeling—we have entered a socialist society, the old ruling class is gone, but a new special class has emerged.

### 人民是国家的主人呢？还是奴隶？民盟青岛市委委员曲北韦在市政协会议上的发言摘要

　　人民是国家的主人呢？还是奴隶？
　　民盟青岛市委委员曲北韦在市政协会议上的发言摘要
    今天，我国人民内部的矛盾集中的表现是领导与被领导的矛盾。这个矛盾的实质，是党与非党的矛盾。几年以来，共产党内官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义这些恶劣的思想作风的滋长和发展，使得人民内部的矛盾空前尖锐起来。
    我十分怀疑，“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民”呢，还是中华人民共和国的一切权力属于共产党？共产党是为人民服务的呢，还是人民为共产党服务？共产党员是人民的勤务员呢，还是人民的统治者？人民是国家的主人呢，还是奴隶？
    只要是共产党员，不论工作、地位、待遇、生活都可以特殊照顾。宗派主义到处泛滥。面对这样的现实，使我有这样的感觉——进入了社会主义的社会了，旧的统治阶级是没有了，但是，又出现了一个新的特殊的阶层。
