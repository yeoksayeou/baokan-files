　　Why Does a Bumper Harvest Result in Failure to Complete Grain Purchase Tasks?
　　By Our Correspondent  Lù Hào
    The problem is not because the task is too heavy; farmers have more grain in hand than in previous years.
    Liaoning Province achieved a bumper harvest in 1956. However, despite the bumper harvest, the grain purchase tasks were not completed. The plan for 1956 was to purchase 1.8 million tons of grain, but as of the end of May, only 90% of the purchase task had been completed, with 200,000 tons of grain still unpurchased. The plan for agricultural tax in kind was 744,000 tons, but as of the end of May, 60,000 tons remained unfulfilled.
    Is the failure to complete the grain purchase task due to an overly heavy task? No, it is not. In 1955, the province's total grain output was 6,165,000 tons, and 1,666,000 tons were purchased. The grain purchased that year accounted for 27% of the total output and was completed in just over four months. In 1956, the province's output was 7,471,000 tons (this is the final figure determined by the Provincial Bureau of Statistics), and 1.8 million tons of grain were purchased. The purchase figure accounted for 25.1% of the total output, but after seven months of work, the purchase task still fell short. Compared to 1955, grain production increased by 21.1%, while the purchase task only increased by 8%. This indicates that the amount of grain left to farmers after completing the state purchase task was significantly higher than in previous years. The grain purchase task in Liaoning Province in 1956 was not heavy; it was appropriate.

    The bumper harvest clouded the minds of some leaders; the actual output was much lower than originally estimated.
    So, where did the problem of Liaoning Province's failure to complete the grain purchase task lie? The problem arose from overestimating the bumper harvest's output and relaxing the work. The bumper harvest clouded the minds of some leaders in the province.
    In February 1956, Liaoning Province put forward a call for exceeding the production of 9 million tons of grain. This call represented an increase of 2,835,000 tons compared to the province's total grain output in 1955. Under this call, many counties put forward even higher guarantees for increased production. By March, the grain production increase targets reported by various cities and counties had reached 11 million tons, which was 78.4% higher than the actual output in 1955 and 22.2% higher than the originally proposed 9 million tons.
    By September, things were not as smooth as they had seemed at the beginning. Commissioners and county heads calculated grain production in the province, and it only came to 8 million tons. Later, it was determined to be 7.6 million tons. In fact, the grain figures from the final accounts of agricultural cooperatives reported by various cities and counties this spring were only 7,210,000 tons. This is a figure closer to reality. However, according to estimates by relevant provincial departments, about 200,000 to 300,000 tons of grain were wasted last year due to rough harvesting and threshing, plus livestock grazing on green crops. Therefore, adding this wasted grain to the 7,210,000 tons figure from the agricultural cooperatives' accounts became the basis for the finally determined annual output of 7,471,000 tons for the whole province.
    Now it seems that the province's estimate of the bumper harvest was somewhat unrealistic. The actual grain output was much lower than the earliest estimates, and the actual grain figures in the granaries were also lower than the final estimates. However, compared to the output in 1955, there was still an increase of more than a million tons of grain.

    Careless and one-sided mass perspective, relaxation of grain purchase work.
    The overestimation of grain production coincided with a one-sided mass perspective among some leaders. People felt that since there was so much grain, what problems could there be with the purchase task? Since it was advocated to increase farmers' income, what was the harm in giving farmers a little more grain? It seemed that under these circumstances, anyone who was meticulous was being petty towards the farmers and a bit unfair to them.
    According to the "Three Fixes" standard, the annual grain retention in rural areas in previous years was 460 catties, 480 catties per person, and at most 500 catties. However, last year, the general grain retention per person was 500 to 520 catties. In some places, although the retention was slightly less than this figure, in other places, it even reached 800 catties per person. In previous years, each mule and horse retained 1,000 catties of grain per year. Last year, even livestock benefited, and each animal increased to 1,500 catties. Compared to previous years, the excess grain retained by people and mules and horses across Liaoning Province last year, according to conservative estimates, was approximately 400,000 to 500,000 tons.
    In many places south of the pass, four catties of potatoes are equivalent to one catty of grain. Liaoning Province produced two million tons of potatoes last year, but because some leaders in the province believed that the province had plenty of grain, the two million tons of potatoes, equivalent to 500,000 tons of grain, were not used as grain and were distributed to farmers.
    Blind optimism led some leaders to have such a careless and one-sided mass perspective on the one hand, while on the other hand, they naturally relaxed the grain purchase work, and of course, there was even less talk of carrying out political work among the farmers. Some leaders felt that since there was so much grain and the purchase task was not large, what was the need to put in any effort? When they arrived in the counties, some even felt that as long as a few forms were sent out, this year's purchase task could be completed. This made the grain purchase work neither timely nor meticulous in its arrangements. The agricultural cooperative distribution work was also disconnected from the state grain purchase work. In September, the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee arranged for simultaneous harvesting and distribution, and it was not until November that the purchase task was assigned to the grassroots level. In fact, before November, many agricultural cooperatives had already distributed most of the grain to the farmers. However, all of this did not attract the attention of the provincial leadership. It was not until this spring that the province realized that the problem was much more complicated than expected. Originally, people thought that now that the rural areas had been collectivized, the grain used to be purchased from more than 2.9 million farmer households one by one, while now the purchase targets were less than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives, and the problem would be much simpler. But that was not the case. If political work was relaxed, purchasing grain from agricultural cooperatives would never be easier than purchasing grain from individual farmers. On the contrary, the localism of some agricultural cooperatives brought difficulties to the grain purchase work that many people had not anticipated beforehand; especially when the grain had basically been distributed to the farmers' homes, it was of course a more difficult task to ask for the grain back from the farmers' hands.

    Failure to correctly resolve the contradiction between the needs of the state and the needs of the farmers.
    It is certainly wrong to only consider the state's task of purchasing grain without considering the actual needs of the farmers for grain. However, taking such a careless attitude towards grain by one-sidedly only taking care of the needs of the farmers has put Liaoning Province's grain purchase work in an extremely passive situation.
    It is especially worth noting that Liaoning Province has never been self-sufficient in grain. It needs to rely on the central government to allocate 1.2 million to 1.5 million tons from other provinces every year. That is to say, if Liaoning Province can produce one more ton of grain itself, then it can reduce the need to transport one ton of grain from thousands of miles away. This also means that under the current situation of not abundant grain nationwide, if Liaoning Province can ask the central government for one ton less of grain, it is undoubtedly its inescapable duty to reduce the pressure on the nation's grain supply. It seems that some leaders in Liaoning Province have not paid due attention to this aspect, which is very regrettable.
    This can also be proven from a recent news item issued by Xinhua News Agency. The main idea of this news item is: In order to take care of the habits and needs of the masses, Liaoning Province will convert three million mu of land originally used for seed corn to sorghum this year. This is a one-sided piece of news. In 1956, Liaoning Province planted three million mu more corn than in 1955, and harvested more than 300,000 tons more grain; but it also caused dissatisfaction among the farmers. Some places had problems with fuel because less sorghum was planted; some places were not interested in corn because farmers were used to eating sorghum. Therefore, it should be said that it was not entirely appropriate to suddenly increase the corn planting area so much last year. But harvesting more grain is, after all, beneficial to the state and the farmers. Of course, it is wrong to not consider the habits and needs of the farmers at all. However, when people consider the grain issue, being able to eat enough is, after all, the main thing. Only after eating enough can they consider whether to eat well. In fact, the needs and habits of farmers are not forever unchangeable, and besides, planting more corn can also increase the income of farmers. The problem is that Liaoning Province is not stepping up its efforts to do more work to expand the corn planting area as much as possible, but simply giving up the work and suddenly returning the corn planting area to the level of 1955. The grain production target for Liaoning Province in 1957 is 7.3 million tons, and now this production target is threatened due to the reduction in the corn planting area. Obviously, it is very debatable to suddenly reduce the corn planting area by three million mu.
    Liaoning Province has a relatively concentrated number of industrial cities, so it is understandable that the province cannot be completely self-sufficient in grain in a short period of time. Everyone knows that the people of Liaoning contribute huge amounts of steel, coal, machines, and other economic crops to the country's socialist construction every year. Therefore, relying on other provinces to supply some grain is also appropriate. However, this does not mean that Liaoning Province's grain purchase task can be relaxed, nor does it mean that in order to take care of the province's farmers by distributing more grain, it can purchase less grain itself. The summer purchase is about to begin soon, and the autumn purchase will arrive in the blink of an eye. I think it is beneficial to seriously summarize the lessons learned from this grain purchase work.

　　为什么大丰收反而完不成征购粮食的任务？
　　本报记者  陆灏
    问题并不是因为任务过重，农民手里的粮食要比往年多
    辽宁省在1956年获得了大丰收。但是，虽然是大丰收，征购粮食的任务却没有完成。1956年度计划征购粮食一百八十万吨，到5月底为止，购粮任务只完成了90％，还有二十万吨粮食没有购上来。征收公粮的计划是七十四万四千吨，但到5月底，还有六万吨没有完成。
    征购粮食任务没有完成，是不是因任务太重了？不是的。1955年全省粮食产量是六百一十六万五千吨，征购了一百六十六万六千吨，这个年度征购粮食的数字占全部产量的27％，用了四个多月的时间就完成了。1956年全省产量七百四十七万一千吨（这是省统计局最后确定的数字），征购粮食一百八十万吨，征购数字占全部产量的25.1％，可是经过了七个月的工作，征购任务还是落了空。1956年和1955年相比，粮食产量增加了21.1％，征购任务只增加了8％，这说明农民完成国家征购任务后留下粮食的数量还是大大超过往年的，1956年辽宁省的粮食征购任务是不重的，是适宜的。
    大丰收冲昏了某些领导人的头脑，实际产量比原来估计的低得多
    那么，辽宁省不能完成征购粮食任务的问题究竟在哪里呢？问题是发生在过高地估计了大丰收的产量，放松了自己的工作。大丰收冲昏了省里某些领导者的头脑。
    1956年2月辽宁省曾经提出了超额生产九百万吨粮食的号召。这个号召比1955年的全省粮食产量要增加二百八十三万五千吨。在这个号召下面，很多县提出了更高的增产保证。到了3月份，各市、县报上来的粮食增产指标竟达到一千一百万吨，它比1955年的实际产量增加了78.4％，比原来提出来的九百万吨还增加了22.2％。
    到了9月份，事情就不像开始那样顺利了。专员、县长在省里核计粮食产量，算来算去只有八百万吨。后来确定了七百六十万吨。实际上今年春天各市、县报来的农业社的年终结账的粮食数字只有七百二十一万吨。这是一个比较接近实际的数字。但据省有关部门估计，去年由于收割和打场粗糙，再加上牲口啃青，全省浪费的粮食大约有二十万吨到三十万吨左右。因此把这笔浪费的粮食和农业社的账上的七百二十一万吨数字加在一起，这就成了现在全省最后确定的七百四十七万一千吨的年产量的根据。
    现在看来，省里对于大丰收的估计是有些不大切合实际的。粮食实际产量要比最早的估计低很多，粮库里面实有的粮食数字要比最后估计的数字也要低一些。但是，它和1955年的产量比较还是增产了百多万吨粮食。
    大手大脚的片面的群众观点，放松了征购粮食的工作
    粮食产量的过高估计和某些领导者的片面的群众观点吻合在一起，人们就觉得既然粮食很多，征购任务还会有什么问题？既然提倡让农民增加收入，多分一点粮食给农民又算得了什么？好像在这种情况下，谁精打细算就成了对农民斤斤计较，有点对不住农民了。
    按照“三定”标准，往年农村留粮每人每年是四百六十斤、四百八十斤，最高也不过五百斤，但去年一般每人留粮是五百斤到五百二十斤。有个别地方虽然留得比这个数字稍许少一些，但有的地方每人甚至留到八百斤。往年一头骡马每年留粮一千斤，去年连牲口也占了便宜，每头牲口也增加到一千五百斤。去年辽宁全省人和骡、马多留的粮食和往年相比，按保守的估计，大约多留了四、五十万吨粮食。
    关内很多地方都是四斤薯类顶一斤粮食的，辽宁省去年生产了二百万吨薯类作物，但因为省里有些领导者认为全省粮食很多，结果就把合五十万吨粮食的二百万吨薯类没有被顶作粮食分给农民用掉了。
    盲目乐观使有些领导者一方面是这样大手大脚的片面群众观点，而另一方面对于粮食的征购工作就自然而然地放松了，对于农民进行政治工作当然就更谈不上了。有的领导者觉得粮食既然很多，征购任务又并不大，这还要费什么劲？到了县里，有人甚至觉得只要发几张表格下去，今年的征购任务就可以完成。这就使得征购粮食的工作布置得既不及时又不细致。农业社分配工作和国家征购粮食的工作也脱了节。9月份，省委农村工作部布置边打边分，到11月份征购任务才下达到基层。实际上在11月份之前，很多农业社都已经把大部分粮食分给农民了。但是，这一切都还并没有引起省级领导上的注意。到了今年春天，省里才发现问题要比预计的复杂得多。原来人们觉得现在农村已经合作化了，过去粮食要从二百九十多万户农民手里一家一家收购，而现在征购的对象则是不到一万个农业社，问题要简单得多。可是事实并不是这样，如果放松了政治工作，向农业社征购粮食就决不会比向单干户征购粮食来得容易。相反的，某些农业社的本位主义给征购粮食工作带来的困难是很多人事先没有想到的；特别是当粮食基本上已经都分到农民的家里，再向农民手里要粮食回来，这当然是件更加困难的工作了。
    没有正确地解决国家的需要和农民的需要之间的矛盾
    只考虑国家收购粮食的任务，而不考虑农民对粮食的实际需要情况固然是不对的；但是，片面地只顾满足农民的需要，对于粮食采取了这样大手大脚的态度，这就使得辽宁省的粮食征购工作陷入了异常被动的局面。
    特别值得注意的是辽宁省的粮食向来是不能自给的，它每年需要依靠中央从外省调拨一百二十万吨到一百五十万吨。这就是说，辽宁省自己如果能够多生产一吨粮食，那么就可以少从迢迢千里之外运一吨粮食来。这也就是说，在目前全国粮食并不富裕的情况下，辽宁省如果能够向中央少要一吨粮食，这对于减轻全国粮食的压力毫无疑问是义不容辞的。看来辽宁省某些领导者在这方面还没有引起应有的注意，这是很令人遗憾的。
    这从最近新华社发出的一条消息来看，也可以证明这一点。这条消息大意说：为了照顾群众的习惯和需要，辽宁省今年将有三百万亩原种玉米的土地改种高粱。这是一条片面性的消息。1956年辽宁省比1955年多种了三百万亩玉米，多收了三十多万吨粮食；但也曾经引起了农民的不满。有的地方因为少种了高粱，燃料发生了问题；有的地方因为农民习惯吃高粱而对玉米表示没有兴趣。因此去年骤然一下子增加那样多的玉米播种面积，应该说并不是完全很适当的。但是多收了粮食，对国家，对农民毕竟还都是有好处的。当然，根本不考虑农民的习惯和需要是不对的。但是，人们当考虑粮食问题的时候，能不能吃得饱终究还是主要的，只有吃饱了，然后才能再来考虑吃得好不好。事实上农民的需要和习惯也并不是永远不能改变的，何况多种一些玉米农民也同时可以多增加一笔收入。问题就在于辽宁省不是加紧多做一些工作，使玉米的播种面积尽可能地扩大一些，而是干脆放弃了工作，一下子又把玉米的播种面积退回到1955年的水平上来。1957年辽宁省的粮食产量指标是七百三十万吨，因为玉米播种面积的缩减，现在这个产量指标就受到了威胁。很显然，一下子缩减了三百万亩的玉米播种面积是很值得商榷的。
    辽宁省的工业城市比较集中，因此它在一个不短的时间里，全省粮食还不可能完全自给，这是可以理解的。大家都知道辽宁人民每年要为祖国的社会主义建设贡献数量巨大的钢铁、煤炭和机器以及其它的经济作物，因此依靠别的省份供给一些粮食，这也是应该的。但是，这并不是说，辽宁省的征购粮任务可以放松一些，也并不是说为了照顾本省农民多分点粮食而自己就可以少征购一些。目前夏征很快就要开始，秋征转眼也要到来，认真总结一下这次征购粮食工作中的教训，我认为是有好处的。
