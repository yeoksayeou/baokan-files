　　Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou Adjust Prices in Adjacent Areas; Bordering Counties to Establish Price Coordination System
    After consultations between the commercial departments of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, irrational commodity prices in the adjacent areas of Sichuan Province and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces have recently been initially corrected. Over 90% of the more than 280 commodities with price confusion between Sichuan and its neighboring provinces have been adjusted. These commodities mainly include grains, oil, non-staple foods, medicinal materials, and livestock products, which are closely related to people's lives.
    Sichuan Province has a long border with Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the economic ties between the people in the adjacent areas are close. However, in the past, the commercial departments of each province often only considered the business of their own units when dealing with prices in the adjacent areas, and rarely considered the difficulties of the other party and the actual needs of the people. For example, in Chishui River in Gulin County, Sichuan Province, and Nanguan in Bijie County, Guizhou Province, the two places are only separated by a river, but the prices of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products in Nanguan, Guizhou Province, are higher than those in Chishui River, Sichuan Province. The purchase price of live pigs alone differs by nearly 10 yuan per 100 jin.
    During the consultation, the commercial departments of each province examined and criticized the past practice of only caring about their own more revenue, more sales, and disregarding neighboring areas. Based on the principles of secondary producing areas (markets) being subordinate to major producing areas (markets), non-unified purchase areas being subordinate to unified purchase areas, and being subordinate to the natural circulation routes of commodities, prices were adjusted.
    Xuyong, Gulin, and Naxi counties in Sichuan Province and Bijie, Jinsha, and Dading counties in Guizhou Province, as well as Weixin and other eight counties in Yunnan Province, have also jointly stipulated that price coordination meetings will be held quarterly at relevant border points and counties in the three provinces. Price negotiation groups have been established at border points and counties, and a regular price coordination system has been established. ·Xinhua News Agency·

### 川、滇、黔调整毗邻地区物价  接壤县将建立物价联系制度

　　川、滇、黔调整毗邻地区物价
　　接壤县将建立物价联系制度
    四川省和云南、贵州两省毗邻地区商品价格不合理的现象，经过三省商业部门协商后，最近已初步纠正。四川和邻省在价格上发生混乱的二百八十多种商品，有90％以上获得调整。这些商品主要是和人民生活有密切关系的粮食、油料、副食品、药材、畜产等。
    四川和云南、贵州两省有很长的接壤地区，各毗邻区群众之间经济联系密切。但是过去各省商业部门对接壤地区的物价往往只从本单位业务出发，很少考虑到对方的困难和群众的实际需要。如四川省古蔺县的赤水河同贵州省毕节县的南关，两地仅相隔一条河，而贵州南关农、副、土、特产品的价格，却比四川赤水河的高，仅生猪收购价格每百斤相差近十元。
    在协商中，各省商业部门检查和批判了过去只顾自己多收、多销，不顾邻区的本位作法。本着次要产地（市场）服从主要产地（市场）；非统购区服从统购区，以及服从商品自然流转路线等原则，调整了价格。
    四川省叙永、古蔺、纳溪等县和贵州省毕节、金沙、大定以及云南省威信等八个县，还共同规定在三省有关接壤点、县，每季召开一次物价联系会议，并且成立接壤点、县物价协商小组和建立了经常的物价联系制度等。  ·新华社·
