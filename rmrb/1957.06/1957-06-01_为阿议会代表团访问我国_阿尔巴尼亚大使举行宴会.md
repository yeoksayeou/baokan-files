Xinhua News Agency, May 31st. Albanian Ambassador to China, Mr. Balili, held a banquet this evening in honor of the Albanian People's Republic People's Assembly delegation's visit to China.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet.

    Ambassador Balili delivered a speech first at the banquet. Then, Chairman Rita Marko spoke, saying that there is a sincere fraternal friendship between the people of Albania and China, and this friendship is as unbreakable as the will of our two peoples. He believes that no force can weaken the love between the Albanian and Chinese peoples or create obstacles on the common road to socialism.

    Marko congratulated the Chinese people on their continuous and great achievements in overcoming the difficulties left over from the old era and encountered on the road to building a new life.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi also spoke. He said that the friendship and unity between the Albanian and Chinese people are closely linked with the friendship and unity between all socialist countries.

    Liu Shaoqi said that the imperialists are afraid of the unity between socialist countries and are doing everything possible to undermine this unity. The more they fear this unity, the more we must unite; the more they try to undermine this unity, the more closely we must unite.

    Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass at the banquet to wish the Albanian friends a safe journey home and good health.

    Also attending the reception tonight were Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Zhang Bojun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Albania Luo Shigao, former Chinese Ambassador to Albania Xu Yixin, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and heads of various government departments, people's organizations, and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.
