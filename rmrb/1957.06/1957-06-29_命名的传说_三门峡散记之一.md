　　The Legend of the Naming
　　——Sanmenxia Sketches, Part 1
　　Lei Jia
    This young worker immediately wrote his first letter to his comrades. He said he loved the Yellow River, he loved Sanmenxia. He went on to say that he had always loved it, but never more than now.
    So, the next day, this young hydraulic construction worker appeared at the post office entrance. Unexpectedly, a small argument broke out because the person standing in front of him had come to inquire about the date. The clerk behind the counter replied, "You can tell by looking at the postmark!" But the postmark was unclear, and after several people examined it for a long time, the young hydraulic construction worker suddenly exclaimed:
    "Hiding behind the counter won't stop people from making suggestions!"
    "You can make suggestions if you have them, go ahead!" Clearly, the clerk was still busy and didn't show his face.
      "My suggestion is everyone's suggestion." The young hydraulic construction worker looked back at the long queue and said, "I want to know where I've come! This is Sanmenxia, the whole country knows this is Sanmenxia, but your postmark insists on writing some Shijiatan…"
    "No, this is Shijiatan!" The clerk stood up from behind the counter for the first time.
    This was indeed an irrefutable statement; but for the sake of loving Sanmenxia, what couldn't be overthrown? The people behind him began to shout:
    "Who's talking nonsense?"
    "My relatives only know I've arrived at Sanmenxia…"
    "People all over the country know I've arrived at Sanmenxia…"
    This young hydraulic construction worker pointed his finger at the clerk and said, "Did you hear that? I said this is Sanmenxia, not Shijiatan!"
    The clerk met these hydraulic construction workers for the first time. Before, he had only heard various different accents and seen various hands holding letters reaching out to him; now standing in front of him was a young face with high eyebrows and a spirited look, as if a breath could blow down the Sanmen Stone Island. The clerk's face flushed red, and he stammered:
    "The suggestion is very good, I want to say… why didn't you make such a good suggestion earlier?"
    The worker also seemed to see him for the first time. It turned out this was a student-like person, with a somewhat pale face, wearing black-framed glasses, and beads of sweat on his small nose.
    Soon, all the postmarks were changed to the three characters "Sanmenxia." This was the first time the hydraulic construction workers participated in the discussion about the naming of Sanmenxia City.
    The second discussion took place on the work zone road.
    At that time, the preparatory work for Sanmenxia was already underway. On a newly built road, drillers, surveyors, geologists, and some visitors, including reporters and writers, walked every day. Everyone who saw Sanmenxia for the first time felt excited, and on the way back, they talked about the concrete dam, the large reservoir, and the future city next to the reservoir.
    After the postmarks were changed to Sanmenxia, the signs for the Sanmenxia work zone also appeared. It included several bases for constructing the Sanmenxia project: Shijiatan, Daan, and Huixing. Due to geographical limitations, these three bases were far apart. The Engineering Bureau moved from Daan to Huixing in order to give the main battleground to the vanguard combat troops. Some affiliated enterprises also had to be built in Huixing, and the so-called future city referred to this place. The current location of the Engineering Bureau is the center of the future city, and because it is directly opposite Huixing Town, some people temporarily call it New City.
    Three visitors were very concerned about the naming of the future city. Some advocated calling it Hubin City (Lakeside City), some advocated calling it Huixing City… They all had their own opinions, and the debate was quite fierce. It was a windy day, which did not hinder their discussion at all. On the contrary, they borrowed the encouragement of this enthusiasm to finally move forward step by step against the wind.
    Fantasy is always expressed in the form that one loves, so everyone favored their own naming. Hubin City seemed to have the upper hand; but one of the opinions was very stubborn, as if holding a jujube in his mouth, and refused to give in.
    At this time, a young worker came from behind. He had already heard what they were discussing, and suddenly said with some emotion:
    "What do you mean by Hubin City? You just saw Sanmenxia, why not just call it Sanmenxia City?"
    After he finished speaking, he walked forward, as if the wind had no effect on him at all, striding forward. The three people wanted to see the face of this young worker, but their eyes were blinded by the sand, and at the same time, they turned their backs to resist the wind and sand, unable to move a step.
    It is not difficult to imagine that this young worker was the one who made the suggestion to the post office. This time he represented the hydraulic construction workers of Sanmenxia and expressed his opinion.
    On March 26, 1957, the State Council issued an order to establish Sanmenxia City. The clerk at the post office received this newspaper. He was again the first propagator of hope. He said loudly to a worker in front of the counter, "Your wish…!" To everyone, he said, "Our Sanmenxia City…".
    The order did not mention the origin of the name Sanmenxia City. Since it cannot be recorded in history books, I will record it here as a legend. (To be continued)

　　命名的传说
　　——三门峡散记之一
　　雷加
    这位年青工人，立刻给他的战友写了第一封信。他说他爱黄河，爱三门峡。他又接着说，他一直在爱着，但是没有比现在更爱它了。
    于是第二天，这位年青的水工建设者在邮局门口出现了。想不到发生了一阵小小的争吵，原来站在他前面的那个人是来查问日期的。只听见办事员在柜台后面答：“你看看邮戳就知道啦！”偏偏邮戳不清楚，几个人查看了半天，突然这位年青的水工建设者叫道：
    “你躲在柜台后面，也挡不住别人提意见呵！”
    “有意见就可以提，你提吧！”显然办事员还在忙着，仍然没有露出身子来。
      “我的意见，就是大家的意见。”年青的水工建设者回头望了望长长的行列，然后说道：“我要知道我到什么地方来啦！这里是三门峡，全国都知道这里是三门峡，你的邮戳上偏写上个什么史家滩……”
    “不，这里是史家滩！”办事员第一次从柜台后面站起来了。
    这的确是一句不可辩驳的话；但是为了热爱三门峡，有什么不可推翻的呢？后面的人跟着嚷起来：
    “谁说的鬼话？”
    “我的亲人只知道我到了三门峡……”
    “全国的人，都知道我到了三门峡……”
    这位年青的水工建设者，对办事员用手一指说：“你听见没有？我说这里是三门峡，不是史家滩！”
    办事员第一次同这些水工建设者见面了。以前他只听见各种不同的口音，向他伸来的各种不同的捏着信件的手；现在站在他面前的是一副眉高气扬的年青的面孔，仿佛呵一口气，就可吹倒三门石岛似的。办事员涨红了脸，讷讷地说：
    “意见很好，我要说……这么好的意见为什么不早提呢？”
    工人也仿佛第一次看见他。原来这是一个学生模样的人，面孔有些苍白，戴着一副黑框眼镜，小小的鼻尖上冒着汗珠。
    不久，所有邮戳上都改成三门峡三个字了。这是水工建设者第一次参加三门峡市命名的讨论。
    第二次讨论，是在工区公路上进行的。
    那时，三门峡准备工程已在进行。在一条新修的公路上，每天走着钻工，测量工，地质人员，还有一些来参观的人，其中也有记者和作家。凡是第一次看到三门峡的人，都怀着激动的心情，在归来的路上，谈论着那座混凝土大坝，那个大水库，还有水库旁边的那座未来的城市。
    从邮戳上改成三门峡之后，三门峡工区的招牌也出现了。它包括了建筑三门峡工程的几个基地：史家滩，大安和会兴。因为地形的限制，这三个基地相距甚远。工程局从大安迁到会兴来，就是为了把主要阵地让给前哨战斗部队。有些附属企业也只好在会兴修建起来，所谓未来的城市，就是指的这里。工程局现在的所在地，就是未来城市的中心，因与会兴镇遥遥相对，有人暂时叫它新城。
    有三个参观的人，非常关心未来城市的命名。有人主张叫湖滨市，有人主张叫会兴市……他们各有己见，争论得相当厉害。那天刮着大风，一点也没有妨碍他们的讨论。相反的，他们借着这种热情的鼓舞，才好不容易地一步一步地迎风前进。
    幻想总是借着自己所爱好的形式表现出来的，因此每个人都偏爱着自己的命名。湖滨市似乎有些占了上风；但是其中的一个意见也十分固执，有如噙住一颗蜜枣一般，始终不肯让步。
    这时，一个年青工人从后面赶来了。他已经听到了他们讨论的什么，忽然带些感情地发言道：
    “你们说的湖滨市是什么意思？你们刚刚看了三门峡，为什么不直接了当地叫三门峡市呢？”
    他说完就向前走去了，竟像大风对他毫无影响一样，大踏步地走去了。这三个人想看看这个年青工人的面孔，却被砂子迷住了眼睛，同时，他们背过身来，抵御着风砂，一步也走不动了。
    不难想像，这个年青工人就是向邮局提出意见的那个人。这一次他又代表三门峡的水工建设者，发表了自己的意见。
    1957年3月26日，国务院发布了设置三门峡市的命令。邮局的办事员接到了这份报纸。他又是第一个希望的传播者。他对着柜台前面的一个工人大声地说：“你们的心愿……！”对每个人说，我们的三门峡市……。
    命令中没有提到三门峡市命名的由来。既然不能载诸史册，我就把它当做传说记在这里。（续完）
