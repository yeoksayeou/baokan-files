Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The State Council's instructions on strengthening the leadership of current agricultural production are as follows:

    I. We are currently in a season of intense agricultural activity, and the climate in the first half of this year has been abnormal. Some areas have already experienced flooding, while others are threatened by drought. This should be taken seriously by all regions. Doing a good job in agricultural production and increasing crop yields is one of the most important material foundations for regulating internal contradictions among the people. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, all regions must focus on leading agricultural production while carrying out the rectification movement, and ensure that rectification and production are not neglected. Provincial-level leading bodies must ensure that they have sufficient personnel to lead agricultural production. County-level rectification should be postponed until after provincial-level rectification, and even greater efforts should be made to lead current agricultural production.

    II. All regions should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of the spring planting situation. All land that has not yet been planted should be planted in season if possible; if the season has passed, late crops should be planted as quickly as possible. Agricultural production cooperatives are required to make full use of all available land in order to plant more and harvest more. Hebei Province's "No Idle Land Campaign," which encourages agricultural production cooperatives or individual members to cultivate scattered small plots of wasteland without undermining soil and water conservation, has been very effective and can be emulated by other regions. However, no wasteland that would damage soil and water conservation if cultivated is allowed to be reclaimed.

    The wheat harvest season has arrived in northern regions. We should learn from the experiences and lessons of last year, organize the wheat harvest well, harvest and thresh carefully, prevent any disaster losses, and ensure that every grain is brought home.

    III. Strengthen field management of spring-sown crops. Mobilize the masses to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and protect seedlings, and also seize the time to weed and cultivate, and apply additional fertilizer. Strengthen the prediction and forecasting of plant diseases and insect pests, prepare medicines and machinery, fight against plant diseases and insect pests, and protect crops. The planned cotton planting area was not completed this year. Therefore, it is even more necessary to take various effective measures in terms of replanting seedlings, protecting seedlings, weeding, topdressing, and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and strive to improve the yield per unit area and total output of cotton.

    IV. Strengthen drought resistance and flood prevention work. Some areas in North China have not had rain for a long time this spring, and spring planting has already been adversely affected. In areas where it has rained recently, the drought has been alleviated; however, areas where it has not rained thoroughly and are still suffering from drought must actively mobilize the masses to carry out drought resistance. All water conservancy facilities should be used, wells and semi-finished wells should be repaired and renovated, potential should be tapped, water should be saved, and the irrigated area should be expanded.

    The rainy season has arrived in the south, and some areas have already experienced floods and waterlogging due to excessive rainfall. The rainy season is also approaching in the north, so we must actively prepare for flood prevention and drainage. Flood control and drainage projects, especially for key sluice gate and canal projects, should be strengthened in management and maintenance, and responsibility should be assigned by sections and areas. Water conservancy projects involving counties, special districts, and provinces should be jointly negotiated by the relevant provinces, special districts, and counties to establish unified management organizations and promptly resolve conflicts between them in terms of water use and flood control and drainage. The Ministry of Water Resources should promptly assist in resolving problems that cannot be resolved by provinces. Everyone should proceed from the overall situation and overcome departmentalism. Avoid causing mass disputes and bringing about political and economic losses.

    V. Currently, agricultural work is very busy, the seasonal gaps are very short, and various agricultural tasks are very heavy. Some areas have already felt a shortage of labor. It is necessary to organize all those who can participate in labor and put them into production during the busy agricultural season. Agricultural production cooperatives must make arrangements for various agricultural tasks. Agricultural tasks that were missed in the contracting, as well as agricultural tasks that have increased due to drought resistance, drainage, pest control, etc., should be added, and the number of contracted tasks can be appropriately increased according to the actual situation. The number of original contracted tasks cannot be mechanically limited, which would affect field management and efforts to resist natural disasters.

    The "output contracted to the team, work contracted to the group, and field management contracted to the household" method recently implemented by agricultural production cooperatives in various places is a new creation of unified management, graded management, clear division of labor, and individual responsibility of the cooperatives. It is hoped that all regions will summarize their experiences and study and emulate them.

    VI. Some agricultural production cooperatives in some areas still have some difficulties in terms of the turnover of production funds, and urgently need water lifting tools, commercial fertilizers, and pest control medicines and machinery, but are unable to purchase them. Therefore, on the one hand, agricultural production cooperatives should actively strive to solve the difficulties of production funds by clearing public property and mobilizing members to invest. On the other hand, relevant departments should promptly issue agricultural loans and advance payments for agricultural products. At the same time, we should continue to find ways to adjust and solve the difficulties of food and feed for draught animals in disaster areas, so as to ensure that labor and animal power are normally put into the tense production of the current busy agricultural season.

### 增加农作物产量是调节内部矛盾的重要物质基础  国务院指示各地抓紧领导农业生产

　　增加农作物产量是调节内部矛盾的重要物质基础
　　国务院指示各地抓紧领导农业生产
    新华社10日讯  国务院关于加强当前农业生产领导的指示。全文如下：
    一、目前正处在农事紧张的季节，今年上半年的气候又不很正常，有的地方已经出现涝灾，有的地方又受到旱灾的威胁，这应该引起各地严重注意。搞好农业生产，增加农作物的产量，是调节人民内部矛盾的一个最重要的物质基础。为了争取今年农业大丰收，各地在整风运动的同时，必须抓紧对农业生产的领导，切实做到整风、生产两不误。省级领导机关必须保证有一定的力量领导农业生产。县级整风推迟到省级整风以后进行，更应该用全力领导当前的农业生产。
    二、各地应该立即深入检查春耕播种的情况。凡是还没有播种的土地，要力争按季节种上；如果季节已过，也要抢种晚庄稼。要求农业生产合作社把可以利用的土地全部利用起来，争取多种多收。河北省开展“无闲地运动”，在不破坏水土保持的前提下，由农业生产合作社或者社员个人把零散的小片荒地开垦出来，收效很大，各地可以仿行。但是，凡属在开垦后会破坏水土保持的荒地，不准开垦。
    北方各地麦收季节已到。应该接受去年的经验教训，组织好麦收工作，细收细打，防止任何灾害损失，保证作到颗粒还家。
    三、加强春播作物的田间管理工作。发动群众查苗、补苗、保苗，并且抓紧锄草中耕，追施肥料。加强对病虫害的预测预报，准备好药械，向病虫害做斗争，保护禾苗。今年棉花播种面积未能完成计划。因此更必须在补苗、保苗、锄草、追肥和除治病虫害等方面采取各种有效措施，尽力争取提高棉花的单位面积产量和总产量。
    四、加强抗旱防涝的工作。华北部分地区今年春季长期没有下雨，春耕播种，已经受到不利的影响。近日落雨的地区，旱象已有缓和；但是，未落透雨、仍然苦旱的地区，必须积极发动群众，进行抗旱。应该利用一切水利设施，修整改造成井和半成井，发挥潜力，节约用水，扩大灌溉面积。
    南方雨季已经到来，某些地方因雨水过多已经发生洪灾和涝灾，北方雨季也快要到来，因此，都要积极准备防涝防洪。防洪排涝工程，特别是对于关键性的闸门渠道工程，应该加强管理和养护，分段分片负责。关联到县与县、专区与专区、省与省之间的水利工程，应该由有关的省、专区、县共同协商，建立统一的管理组织，及时解决彼此之间在用水和防洪排涝方面的矛盾。省与省争执不决的问题，水利部应该及时协助解决。大家都应该从整体出发，克服本位思想。避免造成群众纠纷，带来政治上和经济上的损失。
    五、目前农事很忙，季节空隙很短，各种农活都很繁重。有些地方已经感到劳力不足，必须把可能参加劳动的人都组织起来，投入农忙季节的生产。农业生产合作社必须作好各种农活的安排。包工当中漏列的农活，以及因抗旱排涝除虫等等而增加的农活，都应该补充安排进去，并且可以根据实际情况，适当地增加包工的数目，不能机械地限定于原来包工的数目而影响田间管理和抵抗自然灾害的努力。
    近来各地农业生产合作社实行的“产包到队、工包到组、田间管理包到户”的办法，是合作社统一经营、分级管理、明确分工、个人负责的新创造，望各地总结经验，研究仿行。
    六、有些地方，有些农业生产合作社，在生产资金周转方面还存在着一些困难，迫切需要提水工具、商品肥料和治虫药械，但是无力购买。因此，一方面农业生产合作社应该从清理公有财物和发动社员投资方面，积极努力解决生产资金的困难，另一方面有关部门应该把农业贷款和农产品预购款及时发放下去；同时，对于灾区的食粮和耕畜饲料的困难，也应该继续设法调剂解决，以保证劳力和畜力正常投入当前农忙季节的紧张生产。
    总理  周恩来  1957年6月10日
