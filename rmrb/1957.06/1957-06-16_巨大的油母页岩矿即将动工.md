Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, June 15th. A huge open-pit oil shale mine – the Fushun East Open-Pit Mine – is about to officially commence construction.

　　At present, the construction unit is actively gathering forces and stepping up various preparatory work.

　　The Fushun coalfield is covered with a large amount of brown oil shale rich ore, with a high oil content, which is a good raw material for synthetic petroleum. The oil shale layer here is very thick, and the stripping ratio is very small. On average, for every 3.53 tons of gangue stripped, one ton of shale can be mined. Therefore, it is very suitable for open-pit mining and the cost is relatively low.

　　At present, the Fushun shale oil industry, which is known as China's synthetic petroleum industrial base, relies solely on the West Open-Pit Coal Mine for the supply of oil shale, which cannot meet the needs of rapid development. The construction of the East Open-Pit Mine will fully utilize the abundant oil shale reserves and increase the production of synthetic petroleum.

　　This mine was designed with the help of the Soviet Union.

### 巨大的油母页岩矿即将动工

　　巨大的油母页岩矿即将动工
    新华社抚顺15日电　一个巨大的露天开采的油母页岩矿——抚顺东露天矿，将要正式动工兴建。
    现在，建设单位正积极集结力量，加紧进行各项准备工作。
    抚顺煤田上部复盖着大量褐色的油母页岩富矿，含油率高，是人造石油的好原料。这里的油母页岩层很厚，剥采比又很小， 平均每剥离三点五三吨矸石就可以采出一吨页岩，因此很适合露天开采，成本较低。
    现在号称我国人造石油工业基地的抚顺页岩油工业，所用的油母页岩仅靠西露天煤矿供应，不能适应急待发展的需要。东露天矿的建设，将把蕴藏丰富的油母页岩充分地利用起来，增加人造石油产量。
    这个矿是苏联帮助我国设计的。
