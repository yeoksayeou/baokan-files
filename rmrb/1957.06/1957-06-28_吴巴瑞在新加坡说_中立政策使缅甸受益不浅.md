Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, June 27th: Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe told reporters in Singapore on the 24th, during his visit, that Burma's neutral policy between the world's major powers has greatly benefited Burma.

He said that countries like Malaya and Singapore could learn a lot from independent countries like Burma and India. The Federation of Malaya does not need to copy our foreign policy and our planned economic approach, but it can gain a lot of valuable experience from our mistakes and shortcomings.

He said that we are unwilling to export our ideas to other countries; every country is free to decide which political approach is most beneficial to itself.

U Ba Swe is also planning to visit the Federation of Malaya.

　　吴巴瑞在新加坡说
    中立政策使缅甸受益不浅
    新华社27日讯  新加坡消息：缅甸副总理吴巴瑞24日在访问新加坡的时候对报纸记者说，缅甸在世界大国之间采取的中立政策，已经使缅甸受益不浅。
    他说，像马来亚和新加坡这种国度，实在可以从缅甸和印度这些独立国家中，学习到许多东西。马来亚联合邦不需要抄袭我们的外交政策和我们的计划经济方式，但是可以从我们的错处和不够之处获取许多宝贵的经验。
    他说，我们不愿意对其他国家输出我们的思想，每一个国家都有自由决定那种政治方式对自己最有好处。
    吴巴瑞还准备到马来亚联合邦访问。
