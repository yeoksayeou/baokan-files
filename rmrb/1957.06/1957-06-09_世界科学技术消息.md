　　Portable Rubber Airplane
　　An airplane made of rubber has been successfully test-produced in the United States and recently underwent a test flight.
　　This airplane has wings that are twenty-three feet long. When the entire airplane is folded up, it is only about the size of an ordinary television set and can be carried around. When it needs to fly, it only takes a few minutes to inflate the airplane with compressed air. Then, after installing a metal engine with more than forty horsepower and a small wooden propeller, it can fly to a height of up to five thousand feet.
　　This airplane travels at a speed of over sixty miles per hour in flight and less than forty miles per hour upon landing. Its fuel consumption is very economical. Therefore, one refueling allows it to fly for eight hours in the air.
　　Because this airplane can be dropped in packages from the air, it can be used by flight personnel who have fallen into the sea.
　　Unveiling the Mystery of High-Altitude Atmospheric Temperature
　　What exactly is the temperature of the high-altitude atmosphere? A recent article in "Soviet Russia" reported on the Soviet Union's research results in this area. The article states that Soviet scientists have synthesized materials from previous rocket explorations to obtain materials on atmospheric temperature at various altitudes. The first lowest point of atmospheric temperature is at an altitude of ten to fourteen kilometers above the ground, where the temperature is about minus fifty-five degrees to sixty-five degrees Celsius. From there upwards, the temperature begins to rise, reaching a maximum point (zero to plus fifteen degrees Celsius) at a distance of forty-five kilometers from the ground; but afterwards, the temperature drops again, and a second lowest point appears at a distance of eighty kilometers from the ground, at about minus seventy degrees Celsius.
　　The Soviet Union began using rockets to explore the upper atmosphere several years ago and has done a great deal of work in this area over the years. During the International Geophysical Year, the Soviet Union will launch rockets even further into the air, hundreds of kilometers from the ground, in order to better explore the mysteries of the high altitude.

    能携带的橡皮飞机
    一种用橡皮制成的飞机已经在美国试制成功，最近进行了试飞。
    这种飞机有二十三英尺长的机翼，如果把整个飞机折叠起来，只有一架普通电视机那么大，可以随身携带。需要飞的时候，只要几分钟就可以用压缩空气把飞机打足气，再装上一座四十多匹马力的金属发动机和一只小型木制的螺旋桨，就可以飞到高达五千英尺的天空。
    这种飞机飞行时每小时的速度达六十英里以上、降落时每小时不到四十英里。它消耗燃料非常节省。因此，装一次油可以在空中飞行八个小时。
    因为这种飞机可以打成包裹空投，所以它可以供给坠落到海上的飞行人员使用。
      揭开高空大气温度之谜
    高空大气温度到底是多少？“苏维埃俄罗斯报”最近刊载的一篇文章报道了苏联在这方面的研究结果。文章说，苏联科学家综合了历次火箭探测材料，得到了各种不同高度大气温度的材料。大气温度的第一个最低点在距地面十到十四公里的高空，那里的温度约为零下五十五度到六十五度。由此往上，温度就开始上升，距地面四十五公里的地方达到最高点（零度到零上十五度）；但往后温度就重新下降，距地面八十公里的地方出现第二个最低点，约为零下七十度。
    苏联早在几年前就开始利用火箭探测大气高层，几年来在这方面做了大量工作。在国际地球物理年期间，苏联将把火箭更进一步发射到离地面几百公里的高空，以便更好地探测高空的奥秘。
