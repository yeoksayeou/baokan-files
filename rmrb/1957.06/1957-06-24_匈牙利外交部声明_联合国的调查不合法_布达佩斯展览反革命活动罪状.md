Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 23rd: A spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 21st, saying that the Hungarian government does not recognize the legitimacy of the United Nations five-member committee's investigation into the counter-revolutionary events in Hungary in October of last year.

The spokesman said that the Hungarian government already stated in its January declaration that the activities of the United Nations five-member committee established to investigate the so-called "Hungarian question" are an intervention in Hungary's internal affairs. The spokesman pointed out that this committee was established under the manipulation of certain major powers, primarily the United States. From the beginning, it was prepared to produce a report that conformed to the interests of the U.S. government. Because the purpose of establishing this committee was so obvious, representatives of many non-socialist countries, such as India, Indonesia, Iran, Burma, and others, refused to participate in the work of this committee.

The spokesman also revealed that imperialists have been creating a slander campaign against the Hungarian state, people, and government in recent weeks. The purpose of this campaign is to prepare public opinion for the publication of the committee's so-called report on the "Hungarian question."

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 23rd: "Exhibition of Crimes of Hungarian Counter-Revolutionary Activities from October 23rd to November 4th, 1956" opened in Budapest on June 22nd. The pictures, documents, weapons, and other materials displayed in the eight halls powerfully exposed the preparations made by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries before the October events, the atrocities committed during the events, and the assistance provided by Western countries to the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces.

　　匈牙利外交部声明
    联合国的调查不合法
    布达佩斯展览反革命活动罪状
    据新华社布达佩斯23日电　匈牙利外交部发言人6月21日发表声明说，匈牙利政府不承认联合国五人委员会调查去年十月匈牙利反革命事件的合法性。
    发言人说，匈牙利政府在今年1月的声明中就已认定，为调查所谓“匈牙利问题”而成立的联合国五人委员会的活动是对匈牙利内政的干涉。发言人指出，这个委员会是在某些大国，首先是美国的操纵下成立的。它从一开始就准备制造符合于美国政府利益的报告。由于成立这个委员会的目的十分明显，所以很多非社会主义国家，如印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、缅甸等国的代表都拒绝参加这个委员会的工作。
    发言人还揭露帝国主义者近几周来正在制造一个反对匈牙利国家、人民和政府的污蔑宣传运动。这个运动的目的是为发表这个委员会的所谓“匈牙利问题”的报告准备舆论。
    据新华社布达佩斯23日电“揭发1956年10月23日到11月4日匈牙利反革命活动罪状展览会”6月22日在布达佩斯开幕。在八个大厅里陈列的图片、文件、武器等材料，向观众有力地揭露了匈牙利国内外反革命分子在十月事件前的准备工作、事件中的暴行，以及西方国家对匈牙利反革命势力的援助。
