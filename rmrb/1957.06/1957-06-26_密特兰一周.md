A Week in the Midlands

　　II. We Were Treated as “Overseas Buyers”

    The British Industries Fair is held in Birmingham every spring. When we arrived in the city, the fair had already been open for more than a week, and was about to end in a day or two. Like the climax of a drama always being placed at the end, the day we visited was said to be the busiest day of the entire exhibition.

    We were introduced by the Federation of British Industries. Perhaps it was for this reason that, upon entering, we were not given press passes or visitor passes, but instead each of us was given an oval badge with the words "Overseas Buyer" printed on it. Without it, we couldn't enter. We had no choice but to act as "buyers" and pin it to our lapels.

    The architecture of the venue was very simple, quite like the factory workshops we later saw in Coventry, but it seemed deeper. The small luggage-towing motorcycles commonly seen at train stations also appeared here. Those who were too lazy to walk could spend a few shillings to sit on one and have it pull them around the venue.

    The exhibits were arranged in rows. Seven hundred British companies participated in the exhibition, each with its own small plot of land. We walked forward in order: one side was vacuum cleaners, the other was refrigerators...; further on were fireplace mantels, washing machines, table lamps.... Although there were also models of nuclear power plants and large machinery on display here, it always gave one the feeling of being in the basement of a London department store selling household goods.

    Halfway there, a person carrying a tape recorder suddenly stopped us.

    "I am a reporter from the BBC... Talk about your impressions."

    We smiled apologetically: "We are not 'overseas buyers'. We are your colleagues."

    We rejoiced at having escaped the reporter's entanglement. But before long, a young couple dressed like working-class people blocked our way.

    The man stood facing us. The woman moved a few steps away, forming a pincer movement.

    He reached into his pocket and pulled out a "pass," flashed it in front of us, and revealed his identity: a plainclothes policeman.

    "Do you have a pass?"

    Again, we explained: we are just reporters...; and reporters do not need passes.

    "Sorry, I mistook you for diplomats!"

    Another misunderstanding. The reason, of course, was that "overseas buyer" badge.

    The third misunderstanding was in the exhibition's restaurant. The banquet had not yet started, and people were crowded in the lounge. Two middle-aged men, not very well dressed, greeted us with enthusiasm:

    "Where are you from?"

    "Beijing." Then, they vividly introduced themselves: "We are reporters."

    "Oh!" The other party seemed a little surprised. "We are from Belgium. Why did you expel the Belgian missionaries in China?"

    "Because they were engaged in counter-revolutionary activities."

    The older one, stammering, said in broken English: "You – love – Communist Party?"

    "Is that even a question?"

    "Your government will not let you stay in a 'free country' for two years, because it is afraid that you will change your political beliefs."

    "You wait and see! We'll meet you here again in two years."

    The banquet was about to begin. Everyone walked to their pre-arranged seats. Before parting, the Belgians expressed their "determination" to us: "We will not trade with communist countries!"

    This demeanor and tone helped us make this judgment: they were neither politicians nor industrialists. They were impolite and did not understand economics.

    Is trade between East and West unnecessary? After the banquet, we met Mr. Orchard, the manager of a rubber accessories company, at the exhibition. He stuffed a large roll of sample lists into our hands and sincerely requested: "Please help me contact the Chinese trade authorities."

    Perhaps this was another misunderstanding. But whether Orchard regarded us as "overseas buyers" or as reporters, his attitude was sincere. We promised to fulfill his request as much as possible.

    "Thank you very much! I am a businessman, and I don't ask about politics. Although we are a small factory, we also hope that trade between Britain and China can be expanded... Big companies can do big business with you. After they get in touch with China, our small factories will also 'live'.”

    Walking out of the exhibition hall, we breathed a sigh of relief and put the "overseas buyer" badge into our pockets...

　　密特兰一周
　　二、我们被当作“海外买主”
    英国工业展览会每年春季在伯明翰举行。当我们到达这个城市的时候，展览会已经开幕了一个多星期了，再过一两天就要结束。像戏剧的高潮总是放在后面一样，我们去参观的那天，据说是整个展览期间最热闹的一天。
    我们是由英国工业家协会介绍去的。也许正是这个缘故，在进门的时候，既不是给我们记者证，也不是给我们来宾证，而是发给每人一块印着“海外买主”字样的椭圆形徽章。没有它，是进不了门的。我们只好权充“买主”，把它别在襟前。
    会场的建筑十分简单，颇像我们后来在考文垂看到的工厂车间，不过显得更纵深一些。火车站上常见的拖行李的小摩托车，也在这儿出现了。懒得走路的人，花上几个先令坐在上面，让它拉着在全场转一圈。
    展品一行行地排列着。参加展出的有英国的七百个公司，每个公司都有自己的一小块地盘。我们顺序地向前走去：一边是吸尘器，一边是冰箱……；再过去，是壁炉架子，洗衣机，台灯……。虽然在这儿展出的也有核子能发电站的模型和大型机械，但总是使人摆脱不了这样一种感觉：好像到了伦敦百货公司卖家庭用品的地下室里。
    半道上，一个提着架录音器的人，突然拦住了我们。
    我是英国广播公司的记者。……谈谈感想吧。”
    我们抱歉地笑了笑：“我们不是‘海外买主’。我们是你的同行。”
    我们庆幸着摆脱了记者的纠缠。但是，没有多久，一对打扮得像工人夫妇模样的青年男女，迎面堵住了我们。
    男的和我们面对面站住。女的离开几步，布成了一个犄角的阵势。
    他伸手从口袋里掏出一张“派司”，在我们面前亮了一下，表明了自己的身份：便衣警察。
    “你们有没有通行证？”
    再一次地解释：我们只不过是记者……；而记者是不需要通行证的。
    对不起，我把你们当作外交官了！”
    又是一次误会。原因，当然是那块“海外买主”的牌子。
    第三次误会是在展览会的餐厅里。宴会还没有开始，人们拥挤在休息室里。两个衣衫穿得并不考究的中年人，满脸热诚地向我们打招呼：
    “从哪儿来？”
    “北京”。接着，生动地介绍了自己：“我们是记者。”
    “哦！”对方感到有点儿意外。“我们是从比利时来的。你们为什么驱逐在中国的比利时传教师？”
    “因为他们搞反革命活动。”
    年纪稍大的一个，结巴着嘴，说着不熟练的英文：“你们——爱——共产党吗？”
    “那还用得着问吗？”
    “你们的政府不会让你们在‘自由国家’住上两年的，因为它怕你们改变政治信仰。”
    “你等着瞧吧！两年以后，我们在这儿同你再见面”。
    宴会快开始了。每个人向事先早已排定的座位走去。分手以前，比利时人向我们表示了他们的“决心”：“我们不同共产党国家贸易！”
    这种风度和口气帮助我们下了这样一个判断：他们既不是政治家，也不是实业家。没有礼貌，又不懂得经济。
    东西方之间不需要贸易吗？宴会结束后，我们在展览会上遇到了橡胶附件公司的经理奥恰特。他把一大卷样品单塞在我们手里，诚恳地提出要求：“请你们帮助我同中国的贸易机关联系联系。”
    也许，这又是一次误会。但是，不管奥恰特把我们当作“海外买主”也好，当作记者也好，他的态度是诚挚的。我们答应尽可能地完成他的委托。
    “感激不尽！我是买卖人，不问政治。我们虽然是个小厂子，但是也希望英中两国能扩大贸易。……大企业可以同你们作大生意。他们同中国打上交道以后，我们这些小厂子也跟着‘活’起来了。”
    走出展览会的大门，我们轻松地舒一口气，把“海外买主”的牌子装进了口袋……。
