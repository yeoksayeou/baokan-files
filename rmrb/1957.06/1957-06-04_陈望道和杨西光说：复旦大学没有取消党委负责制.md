    Chen Wangdao and Yang Xiguang say:
    Fudan University has not abolished the Party Committee responsibility system
    (Our Newspaper) Yesterday, Chen Wangdao, the president of Fudan University who is attending a meeting in Beijing, told our reporter regarding the news published in the Guangming Daily on the 2nd that Fudan University had abolished the Party Committee responsibility system, that the Guangming Daily's report had a significant discrepancy with his speech. The fact is that it was not "Fudan University has abolished the Party Committee responsibility system." At the symposium held by the Ministry of Higher Education on May 31st, I talked about strengthening the University Affairs Committee at Fudan University. The Party and administrative leaders of Fudan University, in order to strengthen unity and improve the university's leadership, after discussion with some Party and non-Party comrades, proposed some methods to strengthen the role of the University Affairs Committee. These methods are being submitted to the Ministry of Higher Education for research, and a final decision can only be made after careful discussion. After these methods to strengthen the leadership of the University Affairs Committee are implemented, the university will still be actively led by the Party Committee. How can it be said that the university's Party Committee responsibility system has been abolished?
    (Our Newspaper) Shanghai, 3rd. The Guangming Daily published a news item on the 2nd saying that Shanghai's Fudan University had abolished the Party Committee responsibility system. People in educational circles here are very concerned about this matter. Yang Xiguang, the Secretary of the Fudan University Committee of the Communist Party of China, told reporters regarding this matter: Fudan University has not abolished the Party Committee responsibility system. Recently, in the discussion on the issue of contradictions among the people, the responsible personnel of our university have put forward opinions on strengthening the role of the University Affairs Committee. The purpose is to better strengthen the Party's leadership in all aspects of the university's work and give play to the enthusiasm of all faculty and staff. We are currently studying how to further improve the Party's work in the future and overcome shortcomings in our work in order to better unite everyone and run the university well. The news published in the Guangming Daily that Fudan University has abolished the Party Committee responsibility system is completely unfounded.

### 陈望道和杨西光说：复旦大学没有取消党委负责制

    陈望道和杨西光说：
    复旦大学没有取消党委负责制
    本报讯　昨日，正在北京开会的复旦大学校长陈望道，就2日光明日报刊登复旦大学已取消党委负责制的消息，对本报记者说，光明日报的记载与我的发言有很大的出入，事实上并不是“复旦大学已取消了党委负责制”。我在高等教育部5月31日召开的座谈会上谈的是复旦大学加强校务委员会的问题。复旦大学的党、政领导人员为了加强团结和改进学校领导工作，经过党和非党的一些同志的商量，提出了关于加强校务委员会的作用的一些办法。这些办法正送请高等教育部研究，要经过慎重的讨论以后才能做出最后决定，实行这些加强校务委员会领导的办法以后，学校还是要由党委来积极领导的，怎么能说是已取消了学校党委负责制呢？
    本报上海3日电　2日的光明日报上刊登一则消息说：上海复旦大学已取消了党委负责制。这里教育界人士对这件事很关心，中共复旦大学委员会书记杨西光就这件事对记者说：复旦大学并没有取消党委负责制。最近在关于人民内部矛盾问题的讨论中，本校负责人员曾经提出加强校务委员会作用的意见，其目的是为了更好地加强党在学校各方面工作的领导作用，发挥全体教职员的积极性。我们目前正在研究今后如何进一步改善党的工作，克服工作中的缺点，以便更好地团结大家，把学校办好。光明日报所载复旦大学已取消了党委负责制的消息是完全没有根据的。
