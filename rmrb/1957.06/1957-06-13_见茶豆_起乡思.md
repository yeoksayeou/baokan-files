Seeing Tea Beans Evokes Homesickness
　　Xiao Yu

　　At the National Agricultural Exhibition, I actually saw two exhibits from my hometown - "ghost beans" and tea. They gave me immense joy. In those days, I couldn't help but tell everyone I met. Some friends joked with me: "Look at you, so attached to your hometown!"

　　Yes, I myself couldn't quite figure out the reason at the time; but I thought, there must be some reason in there somewhere.

　　I should first introduce my hometown - Guzhang County. It belongs to the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and is one of the smallest counties in Hunan Province, located in the midst of thousands of mountains and valleys. Even for families living in the county seat, no matter which window they opened, they could face green mountains all year round.

　　This small county seat previously had only three or four hundred households, and the market street was surprisingly small. It is said that one could smoke a cigarette from the south gate to the north gate with plenty to spare. During the Anti-Japanese War, an air raid哨 was set up on the hillside beside the city. Occasionally, when receiving telephone calls about enemy aircraft intruding on Yuanling and other medium-sized cities, it would ring the bell to warn people. However, some people said that there was no need to go to such trouble; just let someone shout "The plane is coming!" towards the foot of the mountain, and the whole city would be sure to hear it. In my childhood, the entire county had a population of only 25,000. Later, after adjusting administrative divisions, I heard that it has now reached more than 70,000.

　　It's not because she is my birthplace that I have any particular preference for her. But, to be honest, the mountains, rivers, trees, and stones of my hometown are truly unforgettable. Even the mountain roads I used to walk as a child, where to turn, where to rest, where there is good spring water, where there is a cool breeze cave, as soon as I close my eyes, they appear as if they were right in front of me. Similarly, I also cannot forget the people of my hometown, those simple faces and their labor and lives. At this moment, I think of the "market days" in Guzhangping in the county seat. Streams of people coming from all directions on mountain roads, carrying or carrying all kinds of things. Those Miao women are always wearing clothes with lace trimming and silver ornaments... All of this, in my memory, is like a folk painting that will never disappear...

　　However, beautiful memories are often obscured by nightmare-like past events. The harsh sound of gunfire, blood-stained executioner's swords, corpses lying scattered on the Heba Plain, heads of people in bamboo cages hanging on swings for public display, and opium, bandits, and "gunmen" even more fierce than bandits... as well as the sad faces and countless tears of good people caused by all of the above reasons. Therefore, although the scenery of my hometown fascinates me and makes me intoxicated, although I know that those mountains and fields called "poor mountains" can produce a large amount of tung oil, tea oil, gallnuts, bamboo, timber, etc., in the past, people always felt that she was walking a dark and long road.

　　From liberation to now, it has only been a short seven years or so. In Beijing, tens of thousands of miles away, in the magnificent Soviet Exhibition Hall, at the exhibition that brings together thousands upon thousands of well-known agricultural products from across the country, I can actually see two things growing in the soil I am familiar with (such a remote small city!). Just think, how could I suppress the joy in my heart like a child?

　　Because I have been away from home for a long time, my impression of "ghost beans" has become somewhat blurred, but tea is completely different for me. Especially when it is March in Jiangnan, in the season when wildflowers bloom all over the mountains, "tea" is the number one event in the lives of hundreds of residents throughout the county seat.

　　The main production area of "Guzhang Tea" is near the county seat, on the sunny slopes of the hilly area centered on Erlong Temple. The best "Guzhang Tea" is called "Mingqian" (plucked before Qingming). In Guzhang, "the tea of Erlong Temple and the water of Beiquan" can be said to be unparalleled. The water quality of Beiquan is very sweet, and the tea brewed with it fills the air with a clear fragrance as soon as the covered bowl is opened. The tea is light green, emphasizing "one flag and one spear." When you drink it, it is slightly bitter, but it quickly turns into a long-lasting mellow aroma.

　　When it comes to the busiest time for roasting tea, the mountain city is filled with the fragrance of tea and the fragrance of pine firewood. Those standing in front of this specially made stove were almost all women in the past, and generation after generation, there have been several "good hands" among them. They are experienced and clever, not only understanding the heat but also being good at observing facial expressions, because tea emphasizes that color, aroma, and taste are all indispensable.

　　I also remember that every year when these days came, I could hear the girls calling each other from in front of the window before dawn. In the dim light, one could already see them working busily in the misty morning. However, at that time, the leaves they painstakingly picked had to be handed over to the tea garden owner after being weighed with scales of eighteen taels or even twenty-four taels to the catty. Often, after working hard for several years, they might not even be able to earn a meager dowry.

　　Today, they should be the masters of the tea gardens. On these busy tea-picking days, they should get up even earlier, with a new foreign headscarf tied around their heads, wearing light-colored aprons, carrying light bamboo baskets, talking and laughing as they step over small bridges and walk towards the hillside... Today, in tea gardens that are ten times as wide as before, there should be more people, not only laughter but also songs echoing across the mountains.

　　In the ten years since I left home, it has been the time before and after the earth-shaking changes in my hometown. Someone like me - as that friend said - who has a strong sense of belonging to my hometown, can be said to be constantly concerned about news from my hometown. First of all: my hometown is liberated, and the banditry that had never stopped since I can remember is completely eliminated. Then there are: electric lights and rice mills in the county seat, and a permanent bridge has been built from the city to Ganziping across the river. Newly built buildings stand tall among the mountains and rivers. Also, the mountain city, which in the past had no other way to communicate other than walking, can now be accessed by car this year. Also, the county high school, which in the past always had insufficient enrollment, has now become a decent school with several hundred students. Finally, returning to tea, in recent years it has become an export commodity famous overseas.

　　Yesterday, I received another letter from home. Caojiaping, a Miao village less than ten miles from my home, has achieved a bumper harvest by cultivating a large amount of mountain land and planting oil tea. Not long ago, it was filmed into a documentary. My nephew asked me in the letter to pay close attention to this matter. Obviously, this short documentary may only be shown for a minute or two, but to be honest, what a major event it is for my hometown, for me!

　　Wei Zhuang's poem contains the line "Do not return home when you are not old, returning home must break your heart." In the old days, whenever returning to a broken home, who has not had the experience of "feeling more timid near home"? Today, if I have the opportunity to go back, this "returning home" will not only not "break my heart" but will certainly give me many unexpected joys. I may also shed a few tears, but there is no sorrow in them, but due to extreme joy and excitement.

### 见茶豆  起乡思

　　见茶豆  起乡思
　　萧禹
    在全国农业展览会上，居然见到了两种来自故乡的展品——“鬼豆”和茶叶。它们给了我极大的喜悦。在那些天里，我情不自禁地逢人便说。有的朋友和我开玩笑：“瞧你，乡土观念那么重！”
    是呀，我自己一时也想不出个道理来；可是我想，这中间总该有些道理吧。
    应该先介绍一下我的故乡——古丈县。它属于湘西苗族自治州，是湖南省最小的县份之一，位于千山万壑之中。就连住在县城里的人家，无论打开那一面窗户，一年四季，都可以面对青山。
    这个小小县城，先前不过三四百户人家，市街小得出奇。据说一根烟卷从南门抽到北门，还可以绰绰有余。抗战期间，在城边的山坡上，设得有个防空哨，偶尔接到敌机侵扰沅陵等中等城市的电话时，也曾当当当地敲钟报警过。但是有的人说，其实用不着那样费事，只消有人朝着山下喊一声“飞机来了”，保险全城都能听见。在我童年的时候，全县人口不过二万五千，后来经过调整区划，到现在听说已是七万多人了。
    并非因为她是我的出身之地，我对她有什么偏爱。但是，说实话，故乡的一山一水，一木一石，确是使人念念不忘的。就连童年时代我常走的那些山路，该在那里转弯，该在那里歇憩，那里有好泉水，那里有凉风洞，只要一闭上眼睛，它们就如在眼前。同样的，我也忘不了故乡的人，那些朴实的脸孔和他们的劳动与生活。此刻，我想起了县城古丈坪“赶场”的日子。从四面山路上鱼贯而来的人流，挑着或背着各色各样的东西。那些苗家的妇女们总是穿着沿着花边的衣裳，戴着银质饰物……这一切，在我的记忆里，正像一幅永不会消失的风俗画图……。
    但是，美好的回忆常常会被恶梦般的往事所掩盖。刺耳的枪声，带血的鬼头刀，河坝坪上横七竖八的尸体，用竹笼子装着挂在秋千架上示众的人头，还有鸦片烟、土匪，比土匪还凶的“枪兵”……以及由于以上种种原因造成的善良的人们的愁眉苦脸和数不清的眼泪。因此，尽管故乡的风物使我着迷，使我心醉，尽管我知道那些被叫做“穷山”的山野里可以大量地生产桐油、茶油、五倍子、竹材、木材等等，但在过去，人们总觉得她走的是一条漆黑而又漫长的道路。
    从解放到现在，算一算不过才短短的七年多，在万里外的北京，在金碧辉煌的苏联展览馆里，在网罗全国著名的千千万万种农产品的展览会上，我竟能见到两种生长在我所熟悉的泥土中的东西，（那样边远的一个小城啊！）请想一想，我又怎能抑制住内心里像孩子一样的欢喜呢？
    因为离家时久，对于“鬼豆”的印象已经有些模糊，但是茶叶对于我却完全不然。尤其是当这江南三月，遍野山花的季节里，“茶”是整个县城几百户居民生活中的第一桩大事。
    “古丈茶”的主要产地就在县城附近，以二龙庵为中心的那一片丘陵地带向阳的山坡山。“古丈茶”最好的叫做“明前”（采摘期在清明以前）。在古丈，“二龙庵的茶、北泉的水”可以说是双绝。北泉的水质十分甘美，沏出的茶，一打开盖碗就清香四溢，茶是浅绿色的，讲究“一旗一枪”，喝到口里，微微的有点苦，但很快的就会转为经久不散的香醇。
    赶上焙制茶叶最忙的时候，山城处处都散发着茶香和松柴的香气。站在这种特制的锅灶前面的，在过去差不多都是妇女，而且一代一代地都出过几把“好手”，她们有经验又聪明，不仅懂得火候，而且善于察颜观色，因为茶叶是讲究色香味三者缺一不可的。
    我还记得，每年一到这些日子，天破晓前就可以听见姑娘们互相招唤着从窗前走过。微明中，已可以看见她们在迷离的晨雾里忙碌的工作了。但是，在那时，她们辛辛苦苦采下来的叶子，不能不经过十八两甚至二十四两的大秤交给茶园主人，往往劳碌了几个年头，也不一定能挣得上一点微薄的嫁妆。
    今天，她们应该是茶园的主人了。在这繁忙的采茶的日子里，她们应该起得更早，头上扎着一方新洋肚手巾，系着浅色的围裙，手提轻巧的竹篮，有说有笑地踏过小桥，走向山坡……。今天，在比之从前十倍广阔的茶园里，人应该是更多了，不仅有笑语，应该还有隔山呼应的歌声。
    离家十年间，正是故乡天翻地复大变化的前后。像我这样一个——正如那位朋友说的——乡土观念重的人，可以说是经常关心着故乡的消息。首先是：故乡解放了，自从我记事以来没有一天断过的匪患完全肃清了。接着是：县城里有了电灯，碾米厂，由城里到隔岸的柑子坪，已经架起了一座永久性的大桥，新建的楼房挺立在山间水滨。还有，过去除了步行之外没有任何其他方法可以沟通的山城，今年可以通汽车了。还有，过去招生总是招不足额的县立中学，如今已经成了拥有好几百学生像样的学校了。最后，回到茶叶来，近几年它已经成了出口商品扬名海外了。
    昨天又接到了一封家信，离我家不过十里地的苗乡曹家坪，因为大量开垦山地，种植油茶，获得了丰收，前不久已被摄成了纪录片，侄子在信上要我密切注意这件事情。很显然，这个纪录短片不过映一两分钟，可是说老实话，对我的故乡、对于我来说，该是一件何等重大的事情啊！
    韦庄词中有“未老莫还乡，还乡须断肠”之句，在旧时代，每当回到破碎了的家山时，谁不曾有过“近乡情更怯”的体会？今天，如果我有机会回去一趟的话，这个“还乡”不但不会使我“断肠”，一定还会给我许多意外的喜悦。我也可能掉下几滴眼泪来，可是，那中间没有半点哀愁，而是由于极度的欢欣与激动之故。
