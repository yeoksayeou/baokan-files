　　Worth a Careful Look, Worth Deep Thought

　　The movie "The Sixth Column" is also being shown in cities like Harbin and Changchun. When I met friends from those places, they all advised me to see it. Everyone who has seen it says it's a good film, just like me.

　　Even though the era in which the story takes place is long gone, this period of history is still worth pondering repeatedly. With war imminent, Paris remained a scene of revelry and song. French intellectuals, who considered skepticism fashionable, continued to make witty remarks, believing that Hitler would only attack the East, not the West. Some were dissatisfied with the status quo but felt even more lost about the future; some felt that capitalism was bad but insisted that socialism was even worse; others openly stated that they would rather be conquered by fascism than let the Communist Party gain power. They had one thing in common: they deeply believed every anti-communist rumor, while dismissing the living reality of the socialist Soviet Union as "propaganda." They had a spirit of "negation" but could not affirm anything.

    The generation of intellectuals who wavered between two paths either finally awakened, like the characters in the film, or perished clinging to their skepticism. Many such people have already perished, and skepticism has been repeatedly criticized, proving its bankruptcy, but we cannot say that it no longer has a market among intellectuals. The specific era, social and historical conditions, and national characteristics reflected in the film are different from China's situation, but I feel that skepticism, nihilism, and anarchism are not absent among our intellectuals. We also do not lack our traditional skepticism, nihilism, and anarchism.

    We should affirm, support, and protect positive, nascent things, even if they are still in their infancy, with a warm attitude, and fight for their prosperity. However, an old habit is the opposite: always unwilling to acknowledge or believe in it, let alone connect one's own destiny with it, preferring to avoid it from afar, as if the less one is involved, the more "noble" one is. As for negative things? Even if they have reached the point of being burnt out, they are still acknowledged, respected, feared, and clung to reluctantly. How illogical this is.

    Why is this the case? Shortsightedness is naturally a factor, that is, not being able to see the laws of historical development clearly, or having the wrong worldview. But why is this so? Ultimately, it is because the vast majority of these intellectuals are of non-proletarian origin; their property and sources of livelihood have created their mental state.

    Then, when society has undergone fundamental changes, when the original economic base no longer exists, when nascent and positive things are no longer in their infancy but exist in large quantities, why do they still fail to keep up with this change? Perhaps it is like what Lao Tzu said in Lu Xun's "Old Tales Retold": teeth fall out before the tongue, and the hard decay faster than the soft. Marxism tells us that the superstructure lingers much longer than the base.

    But this is not good for intellectuals. Those thorough and resolute rightists, those who would rather perish under fascism than accept communism, those who would "rather be a poor child in a capitalist country" than live in a socialist society, of course, have their own paths. Those who waver, hesitate, disbelieve in this and that, should draw a clear line with them, be more discerning, have clearer minds, be more determined, closely integrate themselves with the new and positive things, and sever themselves from corrupt thoughts (such as "Heaven and earth will punish those who are not for themselves"), and completely abandon them. This will remove ideological burdens and allow them to travel light.

    When the new society was still in its infancy, you did not lack expectations for it. When it is growing rapidly, why have you become "blind to a cartload of firewood?" Do not vainly be buried with the old era because you cannot distinguish between big and small, major and minor, essential and non-essential.

    "The Sixth Column" is about French intellectuals, but it is worth our careful viewing and deep thought, and the lessons it contains are worth remembering.

　　值得细看，值得细想

　　哈尔滨、长春等城市也都在放映电影“第六纵队”，我碰到那边的朋友，也都劝他们去看。凡是已经看过的，也都和我一样说这是好片子。
　　尽管故事所发生的那个时代早已过去，这段历史还是值得反复寻思的。战争迫在眉睫，巴黎却依然歌舞升平，以怀疑主义为时髦的法国知识分子，照样说着俏皮话，相信希特勒只打东方，不打西方。有的人也不满现状，却对将来更觉茫然；有的人也感到资本主义不好，但硬说社会主义更坏；有的人则公开表示，宁愿亡给法西斯，也决不让共产党得势。他们有个共同点，凡是反共的谣言，一概深信不疑；而社会主义苏联的活生生的事实，则反倒说成是“宣传”。他们有的是“否定”的精神，而肯定不了任何东西。
    在两条路线中徘徊的那一代知识分子，要不是最后觉悟，像电影中所出现的人物那样，便是抱着他的怀疑主义而毁灭。这样的人已经毁灭了不少，怀疑主义也一再受到了批判，证明了它的破产，但不能说它在知识分子中再也没有市场了。电影里所反映的具体时代、社会历史条件、民族性等等与中国的情况不同，但是我觉得在我国知识分子中，怀疑主义、虚无主义、无政府主义思想这一切种种不是没有。我们也不缺少我们传统的怀疑主义、虚无主义、无政府主义思想。
    我们对正面的、新生的东西，那怕它还在萌芽状态，也应该以热烈的态度来肯定它、支持它、保护它，为它的繁荣盛昌而战斗。可是有一种老习惯却相反，总是不愿意承认它，相信它，更不愿意把自己的命运去同它联结在一块，而宁肯避得远远的，好像越是少沾上点儿越“高尚”似的。对反面的东西呢？那怕它已经到了油干灯尽的地步，也还是承认它，尊重它，怕它，恋恋不舍地依附着它。这是多么说不通的事。
    为什么会这样呢？眼光短自然有关，也就是说看不清历史发展的规律，或者说世界观不对头。可是这又为什么呢？归根结蒂是这些知识分子的绝大多数是非无产阶级之故，他们的财产、生活来源，造成了他们的这种精神状态。
    那末当社会已经起了根本性质的变化，原来的经济基础已经不存在的时候，当新生的东西、正面的东西已经不是萌芽，而是大量存在的时候，他们为什么仍然跟不上这个变化呢？这也许就像鲁迅在“故事新编”中所描写的老子的话那样：牙齿反比舌头先掉，硬的反比软的速朽。马克思主义告诉我们上层建筑比基础要逗留得长久得多。
    但这对于知识分子是没有好处的。那些彻底的坚决的右派分子，那些宁愿亡于法西斯也不要共产主义的人，那些“宁愿去作资本主义国家的贫困儿”也不愿生活在社会主义社会里的人，当然有他们自己的道路。那些动动摇摇、犹犹豫豫、这也不行、那也不信的人，却应该跟他们划清界限，要眼睛亮些，头脑清醒些，意志坚定些，把自己同新的正面的东西紧密地结合起来，把自己同腐朽的思想（例如“人不为己，天诛地灭”之类）割离开来，彻底加以抛弃。这样就能去掉思想包袱而轻装就道了。
    当新社会还在襁褓中的时候，你们并不是没有怀抱过对它的期望，当它正在迅速成长的时候，为什么反倒“不见舆薪”起来了呢？不要因为分不清大与小、主要与次要、本质与非本质而徒然去给旧时代殉葬吧。
    “第六纵队”写的是法国知识分子的事，却值得我们细看、细想，而其中所包含的教训是值得牢记的。
