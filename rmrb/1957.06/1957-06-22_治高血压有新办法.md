Xinhua News Agency, 21st: TASS reports: The Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Latvian Academy of Sciences has recently developed a new method for treating hypertension. Several hundred patients have been treated with this method with great success. Each treatment can lower blood pressure by twenty to forty millimeters (of mercury). After numerous experiments, scientists have determined that "light ions," particles with negative electrical charges in the air, have a beneficial effect on the human body and can lower blood pressure. These "light ions" are particularly abundant at the seaside in summer.

　　治高血压有新办法
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：拉脱维亚科学院实验医学研究所最近研究出一种医治高血压症的新方法。有好几百名患者用这种方法治疗后，收效很大。每次治疗可以降低血压二十至四十米毫（水银柱）。科学家们经过多次试验后确定，空气中带有阴电荷的粒子——“轻离子”对人体有良好的影响，能够起降低血压的作用。这种“轻离子”夏季时在海边特别多。
