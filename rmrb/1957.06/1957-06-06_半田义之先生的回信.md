    Mr. Handa Yoshiyuki's Reply
    To the children of the Literature Group of the "Shanghai Children's Palace":
    Thank you for your letter. And thank you for your thoughts on "Spring Wreath." I am very happy and honored that my book can be published in China. Furthermore, my novel "National Railway Trunk Line," which was serialized in the "Akahata" for ten months, will also be published in China soon, and I feel equally happy and honored. My comrades and friends are all happy for me and say they want to see it as soon as it is published.
    You wrote in your letter that there are still "many children wandering the streets" in Japan, which is somewhat different from the reality. This was indeed the case for two or three years after the war. But today it is hardly seen. It can be said that it is better than in the past, but this does not mean that there is no poverty. There are still many people who want to work but have no jobs, and people who have jobs but cannot make a living because their wages are too low. The lives of the working people are not very comfortable, and most people have to save money to barely make a living. Therefore, there are strikes throughout the year demanding higher wages and allowances.
    My life is also not easy. Last month, my eldest son, who is in the third grade of "New System High School" (equivalent to high school in China), was reprimanded by his teacher in front of everyone for being late with his tuition of 1,200 yen. I heard that there was another student like that. I usually write novels and participate in some social activities, and I am full of energy, but when I encounter such things, I still feel sad. This is because Japan is different from China and is still a capitalist country. What's worse, it is occupied by the United States and has lost its independence.
    I have four children. My eldest son is named Dan, and the remaining three are girls. They are: Haruka (third year of junior high school), Nanako (first year of junior high school), and Akiko (fourth grade of elementary school). The girls are very cheerful and lively and are very interesting children. In addition to doing umbrella repair as a side business, my wife also delivers the "Akahata." My family all live in a city called Ichinomiya in Chiba Prefecture, and I come to Tokyo alone. I go back about once a month. I would like to bring everyone to Tokyo to live together, but housing is difficult to find, and even if I find it, it costs a lot of money, so we still can't live together.
    Many people from Japan have been invited to visit China. These Japanese people are not necessarily all supporters of communism. However, most people praise China's brilliant achievements and the Chinese people's joyful and energetic labor and activities. At the same time, most people admire the demeanor of the Chinese leaders headed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. Of course, there are also people who cannot understand China very well, so let us work harder to enhance understanding and friendship between Japan and China!
    From the various documents published in China, the members of the Japanese Communist Party and progressive workers have learned a lot. Such as the recent documents "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," the "Eighth National Congress," and "Rectification." I not only admire those arguments, but also admire the popular, unambiguous, and correct way of expressing them, and I strive to learn from it.
    I have written a lot. I would like to visit China once, let me visit various things, and I would also like to meet everyone. Then you will know what kind of uncle I am. Well, goodbye!
    The children's novel "The Story of the Beautiful Mountain," which I have been serializing in the "Akahata" since January 1st this year, will end on May 18th, and it is still quite popular. Recently, I plan to send the clippings to Mr. Qu Mai and ask him to read them to everyone when he has time. This is a gift from the poor me to everyone. Okay, I'll say it again: Goodbye!
　　　　Handa Yoshiyuki May 7, 1957

### 半田义之先生的回信

    半田义之先生的回信
    “上海市少年宫”文学小组的小朋友们：
    谢谢你们的来信。也谢谢你们写给我的、对于“春天的花圈”的感想。我的书能够在中国出版，觉得非常高兴和荣幸。接着，我在“赤旗报”连载了十个月的小说“国铁干线”也不久将在中国出版，我同样感到非常高兴和荣幸。我的同志和朋友们，大家都替我高兴，并说出版后要赶快给他们看。
    你们在来信中写道：日本还有“很多儿童流浪在街头”，这跟事实是有些出入的。战后两三年的期间，的确是这样。可是，今天几乎看不见了。可以说，比过去好一些了，但这不等于说已经没有贫困了。想要劳动而没有工作的人、虽有工作但因工钱太少而无法生活的人，还是很多的。劳动人民的生活并不是很宽裕，大部分的人要节省开支，才能勉强生活下去。所以，一年到头有要求提高工资和津贴的罢工。
    我的生活也是不宽裕的。上个月在“新制高校”（相当于中国的高中）三年级的我的长子因迟带去一千二百元的学费，竟在大家面前受到了老师的责备。听说，这样的学生还有一个哩。我平常写些小说，参加一些社会活动，精神很饱满，但碰到这类事情的时候，还是会感到悲哀的。——这是因为日本跟中国不同，还是资本主义国家的缘故。加上，不妙的是被美国占领着，失去了独立。
    我有四个孩子。长子叫丹，剩下的三个是女孩子。她们是：春香（中学三年）、菜菜子（中学一年）、明日子（小学四年）。女孩子都很开朗、活泼，是非常有趣的孩子们。妻子除了做修雨伞的副业外，还担任送“赤旗报”的工作。家里人都住在千叶县下的叫一宫的城市，我一个人到东京来。一个月大约回去一趟。很想把大家接到东京来一起生活，但是住宅很难找到，即使找到了也要很多钱，所以到现在还不能在一起过日子。
    日本有很多人受到中国的邀请访问了中国。这些日本人，不一定都是赞成共产主义的人。可是，大部分的人都称赞中国的辉煌成就和中国人民的愉快而生气勃勃的劳动和活动。同时，大部分的人都钦佩毛泽东主席和周恩来总理为首的中国领导者们的风度。当然，其中也有不能很好理解中国的人，所以让我们为增进日中两国的理解和友好更加努力吧！
    从在中国发表的各种文件中，日本共产党的党员和进步的工人们，学到了很多东西。如最近的“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”、“八大”和“整风”的文件就是。我不但敬佩那些论点，同时敬佩那种通俗的、不含糊的、正确的表现方法，并努力学习它。
    写得很长了，我很想访问一次中国，让我参观参观各种东西，同时也很想见见大家。那末，你们就会晓得我是什么样的叔叔啦。好了，再见吧！
    我从今年1月1日在“赤旗报”连载的儿童小说“美丽的山的故事”，在5月18日将要结束了，还算受到大家的欢迎。近日，我准备把剪报寄给瞿麦先生，请他有空的时候读给大家听吧。这是穷苦的我送给大家的礼物。好吧，再一次说：再见！　　　　半田义之　1957年5月7日
