　　"Speaking Out" and "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" Must Distinguish Between Friend and Foe
　　Lin Handa
    The Chinese Communist Party called on all democratic parties to help the Party in its rectification campaign, and everyone enthusiastically offered opinions and criticisms to some leading comrades in certain organizations, schools, and among Party members. This is precisely a manifestation of people's ardent love for the Party and the government. Unexpectedly, during the rectification movement, some people, under the guise of speaking out and letting a hundred flowers bloom, spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies, attempting to weaken the Party's leadership, attack the people's democratic dictatorship system, and even write anonymous letters and issue pamphlets, engaging in intimidation and counter-revolutionary activities. Is this helping the Party in its rectification? Is this for the better construction of a socialist country? Helping the Party in its rectification is to strengthen the Party's leadership, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and improve our work to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Even when we criticize certain responsible Party member comrades for not paying enough attention to administration and directly arranging work, it is also to strengthen the Party's leadership and improve administrative efficiency. Criticizing the blurring of Party and government lines must not be confused with not wanting the Party's leadership. If we do not proceed from the construction of a national socialist state, do not proceed from the spirit of unity-criticism-unity, do not abide by the Constitution and the CPPCC Charter, slander the Party's leadership as a "Party-controlled world," slander the people's democratic dictatorship system as the root of "three evils," slander the democratic parties' role as assistants and bridges as the Communist Party's shields, want to overthrow the Party's leadership, and want to kill Communists, is this not a rampant attack on the Party and the people? This kind of anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacy is not speaking out among the people, but a struggle between friend and foe.
    Today, all democratic parties and the people of the whole country support the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. The people's eyes are discerning, and everyone sees very clearly: Who led the people of the whole country to defeat domestic and foreign enemies and rescue China from the miserable state of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism? Who led the people of the whole country to complete the New Democratic Revolution and embark on socialist construction? Our country's unprecedented great achievements are undeniable even to capitalist countries. Without the correct leadership and arduous struggle of the Communist Party, where could all these great achievements have come from? Who proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom"? And who is it today that is calling on the people of the whole country to boldly offer opinions to Communist Party members and help the Party in its rectification? Without the Communist Party, none of this would be possible. If we don't want the Communist Party's leadership, whose leadership do we want? If we don't take the socialist road, what road should we take? The people of the whole country know that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; if we don't take the socialist road, we can only retreat to the road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. The anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of a small number of people with ulterior motives must be refuted; the rampant attacks of right-wing ambitionists must be relentlessly repelled. Only in this way can we not hinder the speaking out among our people. Distinguishing between right and wrong and drawing a clear line between friend and foe is not "tightening up," just as anti-Party and anti-socialist activities are not "letting go." Refuting fallacies and repelling attacks is for the sake of enabling us to better speak out and help the Party complete the great rectification cause.
    I would also like to take this opportunity to correct my speech at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee symposium. The "People's Daily" of May 22nd recorded my words as "the entire Ministry of Education has power without authority." What I said was: "Even the Ministry of Education has power without authority in some work" (see the "Guangming Daily" of the same day). The difference of a few words makes a big difference in meaning. I hereby correct it. There are also some other slight discrepancies, which I will not mention here.

　　“鸣”“放”必须分清敌我
　　林汉达
    中国共产党号召各民主党派帮助党整风，大家都很热烈地对一些机关、学校和某些党员的领导同志提出意见和批评。这正是人们热烈爱护党和政府的表现。想不到在整风运动中，居然有人扛着鸣放的幌子，散布反党、反社会主义的谬论，企图削弱党的领导，抨击人民民主专政制度，甚至于写匿名信、发小册子，进行恫吓和反革命的勾当。这难道是帮助党整风吗？这难道是为了更好地建设国家社会主义吗？帮助党整风是为了加强党的领导，进一步地巩固人民民主专政，是为了改进工作，正确地处理人民内部矛盾。就是我们批评某些负责的党员同志不够重视行政、直接布置工作，那也是为了加强党的领导，提高行政工作效率。批评党政不分，和不要党的领导决不能混为一谈。要是不从国家社会主义建设出发，不从团结——批评——团结的精神出发，不遵守宪法和政协章程，把党的领导污蔑为“党天下”，把人民民主专政制度污蔑为“三害”的根，把民主党派的助手和桥梁作用污蔑为共产党的挡箭牌，要推翻党的领导，要杀共产党人，这不是猖狂地向党和人民进攻吗？这种反党、反社会主义的谬论不是人民内部的鸣放，而是敌我的斗争。
    今天各民主党派和全国人民都是拥护中国共产党和人民政府的。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，大家看得很清楚：是谁领导全国人民击败了国内外的敌人，把中国从半封建、半殖民地悲惨的境地里救出来？是谁领导全国人民完成了新民主主义革命，走上了社会主义的建设？我们国家空前的伟大的成就，连资本主义国家也不否认。没有共产党正确的领导，艰苦的奋斗，哪儿能有这一切的伟大的成就？是谁提出
  “长期共存、互相监督”、“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针？今天又是谁号召全国人民向共产党员大胆地提意见，帮助党整风？没有共产党，不可能有这一切。不要共产党领导，要谁领导？不走社会主义的道路，走什么道路？全国人民都知道：没有共产党，就没有新中国；不走社会主义的道路，就只能退回到半封建、半殖民地的道路上去。少数别有用心的反党、反社会主义的谬论，必须驳斥；右派野心分子的猖狂进攻，必须予以无情的回击。只有这样，才能够不妨碍我们人民内部的鸣放。明辨是非，划清敌我界限不是“收”，正像反党、反社会主义的勾当不是“放”一样。驳斥谬论、回击进攻，为的是使我们能够更好地鸣放，帮助党完成伟大的整风事业。
    我还想趁着这个机会，把我在中共中央统战部座谈会上的发言更正一下。5月22日的“人民日报”把我的话记成“整个教育部都是有职无权”。我说的是：“连教育部在某些工作上也是有职无权”（见同日的“光明日报”）。差了几个字，意义大不相同。特此更正。别的还有一些略有出入的地方，这儿就不说了。
