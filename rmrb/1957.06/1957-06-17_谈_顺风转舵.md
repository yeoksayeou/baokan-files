　　On “Changing Course with the Wind”
　　Zeng Tianjia

　　During the rectification campaign, some leading comrades have begun to pay attention to changing their work style, taking the initiative to talk with comrades, solicit opinions, and solve problems in their work and life. "To err and to correct oneself is the greatest virtue." Shouldn't this be said to be a good phenomenon? However, some people disagree, and merely starting from the suspicion of "is this a genuine change?" they satirize this kind of change. The short article "Changing Course with the Wind" by Da Mu, published in Ta Kung Pao on May 22, is like this.

　　This article says: "…They have become so gentle and amiable in an instant, no longer losing their temper, no longer slamming the table, and even making concessions and compromises to comrades where they shouldn't. In short, 'bearing hardship and toiling without complaint,' being extraordinarily diligent." The author "dares not believe his own hearing and vision" because "it is indeed" still "those few leaders" in front of him.

　　The author naturally has the right to doubt this kind of change; however, I think it may not be appropriate to be cynical about it.

　　Mistakes and shortcomings are not predestined to be uncorrectable, and people with mistakes and shortcomings are not forever unable to correct their shortcomings and mistakes, as long as they have the determination to correct them. The purpose of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign is to treat the illness to save the patient, to correct shortcomings and mistakes in our work. Since "those few leaders" have already paid attention to changing their work style, they should be welcomed and encouraged, not ridiculed. Is it not good to be "gentle and amiable?" Is it not good to "not lose your temper or slam the table?" Is it not good to "bear hardship and toil without complaint?" Are we still going to advocate rudeness, table slamming, and temper tantrums...? Of course, "even making concessions and compromises to comrades where they shouldn't" is not good, but this cannot be used to completely deny this change. I think "those few leaders" are really in a difficult situation. In the past, they were criticized for having a bad work style, and now they are also criticized for changing their work style, saying it is fake!

　　To say that "those few leaders" are "changing course with the wind," I think changing course with the wind is not necessarily bad. Since you know that the direction of navigation is wrong, shouldn't you change course with the wind to avoid danger, instead of crashing into the rocks and being shattered to pieces? The question is, what "wind" are you "following"? If you "change course" by following the "wind" of the "rectification campaign," can it still be said to be bad?

　　Naturally, in the rectification campaign, some leading comrades change their work style consciously, as a result of improved ideological understanding; others do so due to public opinion and mass pressure. For the latter, we have a responsibility to help them, urge them, and make their changes gradually become conscious and regular, and continue to be maintained not only during the rectification campaign, but also after the rectification campaign. We cannot arbitrarily say, "Your change is fake!" when their work style has just begun to change. What good is that?

　　Even if this change is fake, it doesn't matter. Can't we continue to criticize? Originally, rectification is a lifelong matter. People who have been rectified well in the rectification campaign cannot guarantee that they will not become bad in the future. Therefore, the Party must conduct rectification campaigns time and time again. To doubt the motives of others when they change their work style, or even to ridicule them, I don't think this is an attitude of "treating the illness to save the patient," is it?

### 谈“顺风转舵”

　　谈“顺风转舵”
　　曾田家
    在整风中，有的领导同志开始注意改变自己的工作作风，主动地找同志们谈话，征求意见，解决同志们工作和生活上的问题。“过而能改，善莫大焉”，这应该说是一种好现象吧？然而却有人不以为然，仅仅从怀疑“这是不是真正的转变”出发，就对这种转变加以讽刺。5月22日大公报发表的大木的短文“顺风转舵”，就是这样的。
    这篇文章说：“……他们一瞬间变得那样温存、和蔼，脾气不发了，桌子不拍了，甚至连不该让步和迁就的地方，也向同志们让步和迁就了。总之，‘任劳任怨’，分外殷勤。”作者“不敢相信自己的听觉和视觉”，因为“确确实实”在他面前的“还是过去那几位领导”。
    作者对这种转变有些怀疑，自然，有他怀疑的权利；但是对之冷嘲热讽，我看未必是恰当的。
    错误、缺点并不是命定地不能纠正的，有错误和缺点的人也不是永远不能改正自己的缺点和错误，只要他具有改正的决心的话。中国共产党整风的目的，就是为了治病救人，为了纠正工作中的缺点和错误。既然“那几位领导”已经注意改变工作作风，应该受到欢迎、鼓励，而不应受到冷嘲热讽。难道“温存、和蔼”不好么？“不发脾气、不拍桌子”不好么？“任劳任怨”不好么？难道我们还要去提倡粗暴、拍桌子、发脾气……不成？当然，“连不该让步和迁就的地方，也向同志们让步和迁就了”，不好，但不能据此就完全否定了这种转变。我看“那几位领导”的处境也真难，过去作风不好受批评，现在改变作风也受批评，说是假的！
    说“那几位领导”是“顺风转舵”，我看顺风转舵未尝不好，既然知道航行方向错误，难道不应当顺风转一下舵避免危险，而要碰在礁石上去被打得粉碎么？问题是看“顺”的什么“风”，顺“整风”之“风”而“转舵”，还能说是不好？
    自然，在整风中，领导同志的转变作风，有的是自觉的，是思想认识提高的结果；有的则是由于舆论和群众的压力。对后一种人，我们有责任帮助他们，督促他们，使他们的这种改变能逐步地成为自觉的和经常的，不仅在整风中，而且在整风以后也能继续保持，我们不能在他们的作风刚有转变的时候，就武断地说：“你的转变是假的！”这有什么好处呢？
    即使这种转变是假的吧，也不要紧，我们不可以继续进行批评么？本来整风就是一辈子的事，在整风中整好了的人，不能保证将来不会变坏。因此党要一次一次进行整风。在别人转变作风的时候去怀疑他的动机如何，甚至加以讽刺，我看这未必是“治病救人”的态度吧？
