　　Settling Accounts and Repudiating Debts
　　Li Ting

    Rightists are clamoring to settle old scores.

    The accounts they want to settle, the so-called "old scores," are actually "new scores," calculated from 1949 onward, mainly: land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the purge of counter-revolutionaries, ideological remolding, unified purchase and supply… those few accounts. To settle old scores means to reopen old cases. Today, the purpose of raising these old scores again is only to gain something from the "reversal of verdicts."

    As for the truly old accounts, that is, the accounts before the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially the accounts under their own names, they do not want to settle them, nor do they dare to settle them. The reason is very clear: the result of settling those accounts would only glorify the Communist Party and blacken themselves.

    I say it's okay to settle accounts, it's okay to settle new accounts instead of old accounts. Because the Communist Party is not afraid of settling the above-mentioned accounts, nor can it be overthrown by settling them. However, according to the principle of "reciprocity" and "he who settles others' accounts will have his own accounts settled," I suggest that rightists also lay out their accounts. Let's not talk about old accounts at all, but settle new accounts after 1949.

    In this "blooming" and "contending," rightists have presented a whole set of political theories and programs. Big ones such as "the Party should not directly issue orders to the people," "there should not be another Party system outside the government," "the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root of bureaucracy and sectarianism," "advocating the abolition of the Communist Party's various departments, absorbing non-Party members to participate in Party group work," and even wanting the Communist Party to "step down," "establish a Political Design Institute," expand the democratic parties to ten million people, and establish upper and lower houses. Small ones such as demanding that the Communist Party withdraw from schools, newspapers, and publishing houses, demanding to "remove the Communist Party's cadres," "pick a few people" to "effectively handle" things, and so on, with many tricks, but the only purpose is not to have the leadership of the Communist Party and not to take the road of socialism.

    Let's not talk about small accounts, let us first settle this big account. The democratic parties are willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and are willing to take the road of socialism. From Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chen Mingshu to Chu Anping, Tan Tiwu, haven't they all made solemn promises? They raised their hands, applauded, maybe they can still deny it, but from the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, for a whole eight years, the declarations, documents, and speeches made by these gentlemen and the parties they represent, expressing their willingness to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and their willingness to move towards socialism, are printed in black and white, they should not be able to deny it. If what they are saying today is the truth, then a note should be made in the account that these gentlemen have been telling lies for eight years since 1949.

    In New China, telling lies is not allowed, repudiating debts is not allowed, and it is even more not allowed to repudiate these two big accounts that you have already promised. To overturn the verdict, to repudiate these two debts, the people of the whole country will not agree!

　　算账与赖账
　　李汀
    右派分子叫嚣着要算旧账。
    他们要算的账，所谓“旧账”，其实是“新账”，就是从1949年算起，主要是：土改、三反五反、镇反、肃反、思想改造、统购统销……那几笔账。夫算旧账者，翻旧案之意也，今日而旧账重提，其目的只在于想从“倒算”中捞一把也。
    至于真的旧账，即中华人民共和国成立以前的旧账，特别是他们自己名下的旧账，他们是不想算、也不敢算的，其故甚明，即算的结果，只能给共产党抹红、给自己抹黑也。
    我说要算也可以，要算新账不算旧账也可以。因为上面所说的那几笔账，共产党是不怕算，也是算不倒的。只是，根据“来而不往非礼也”和“算人之账者人亦算其账”的道理，建议右派分子也把账目摊开来，旧账一律不谈，也来算一算1949年以后的新账。
    在这次“鸣”“放”中，右派分子端出了一整套政治理论和纲领，大焉者如“党不应该直接向人民发号施令”、“不应该在政权之外再搞一套党的系统”、“无产阶级专政是官僚主义、宗派主义的根”、“主张取消共产党的各个部，吸收党外人士参加党组工作”、乃至要共产党“下台”、“成立政治设计院”、民主党派发展到一千万人，设立上下议院，小焉者如要求共产党退出学校、报社、出版社、要求“撤掉共产党的干部”、“挑几个人”出来“有效地处理一下”等等，花样繁多，目的却只有一个，就是不要共产党领导，不要走社会主义的道路。
    小账不谈，让我们先算一算这笔大账。民主党派愿意接受共产党的领导，愿意走社会主义的道路，这两条，从章伯钧、罗隆基、陈铭枢一直到储安平、谭惕吾，不是都曾作过庄严的诺言么？举过手，鼓过掌，也许还可以赖得，可是，从1949年第一届全国政协起，整整八年，这八年中这些先生们、和这些先生们所代表的党派所发表的愿意接受共产党领导和愿意走向社会主义的宣言、文件、讲话，黑字印在白纸上，总该无法抵赖了吧。假如今天讲的是真心话，那么应该在账上记上一笔，这些先生们从1949年起，一直讲了八年假话。
    在新中国，讲假话不行，赖账不行，要赖掉这两笔自己早已承诺过的大账更不行。要翻案，要赖掉这两笔账，全国人民不答应！
