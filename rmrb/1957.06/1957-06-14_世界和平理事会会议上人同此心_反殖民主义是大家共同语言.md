Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 13th. The World Peace Council's Colombo meeting entered its third day yesterday. Representatives were divided into two committees to discuss the issue of atomic nuclear test explosions and other ways to ease world tensions.

From the speeches made in the first two days of the plenary session, it can be seen that the opinions and wishes of Asian, African, and Latin American countries that have already shaken off or are in the process of shaking off the shackles of colonialism have never been so strongly expressed and so enthusiastically responded to at a World Peace Council meeting. The enthusiastic participation of the people of these countries, which have a population of 1.8 billion, in the peace movement will usher the world peace movement into a new stage.

In the general discussions of the first two days of the plenary session, not only did the representatives of oppressed countries point out that colonialism means war and the threat of war, but representatives of Western countries, including colonialist countries, also expressed the same view.

French Progressive Republican Alliance General Secretary Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie said at the opening meeting: "Continuing to maintain colonialism, devising new isms in an attempt to force other countries into a position of economic, political, and military protection – these things in themselves contain the seeds of war."

Italian representative Luzzatto pointed out the importance of uniting with the anti-colonialist movement. He said: "If all those who should have freedom and have already acquired the basic rights to survival and independence agree to achieve peace and maintain peace, peace can be achieved." He said: "Old colonialism, in every place where it strives to make its rule permanent, creates a threat to peace." He pointed out: "In North Africa and the Middle East, a new colonialism is directly active. Although this colonialism uses new methods of infiltration and exploitation, it has already shown the same strong force and intimidation tactics as old colonialism." He specifically mentioned the actions of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, equipped with atomic nuclear weapons, in the Mediterranean. His remarks were warmly welcomed and supported.

Canadian representative James Gareth Endicott also expressed a clear opinion. He said that the Colombo meeting is the first large-scale international peace conference held in Ceylon since Ceylon's independence. This fact "can be seen as symbolic, because independence will generate a desire for peace, and at the same time, there will be no consolidated peace without independence and the welfare of all people."

U.S. representative Scott Nearing said that the U.S. policy of economic, political, and military expansion in South Asia and Africa is one of the factors in the danger of war.

During the discussions, many representatives criticized and expressed concern about the U.S.'s Middle East policy and its activities in preparing for atomic war. Representatives from Japan, Korea, China, and Arab countries especially asked everyone to pay attention to the missile bases set up by the U.S. in Okinawa, South Korea, and Taiwan, and to the U.S.'s intervention in the Middle East region, which is currently the greatest threat to peace.

Representatives from many countries advocated the restoration of China's seat in United Nations organizations. In his speech on the 11th, Guo Moruo expressed his gratitude for their just advocacy. The meeting will continue for two more days.

### 世界和平理事会会议上人同此心  反殖民主义是大家共同语言

　　世界和平理事会会议上人同此心
　　反殖民主义是大家共同语言
    新华社科伦坡13日电　世界和平理事会科伦坡会议昨天进入第三天。代表们分成两个委员会，分别讨论原子核试验爆炸问题以及缓和世界紧张局势的其他办法。
    从头两天全体会议的发言情况中可以看到，已经摆脱或正在摆脱殖民主义桎梏的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的意见和愿望从来没有在世界和平会议上得到这样有力的表达和这样热烈的响应。拥有十八亿人口的这些国家的人民热烈投入和平运动，将使世界和平运动进入新的阶段。
    在前两天的全体会议的一般讨论中，不仅被压迫国家的代表指出了殖民主义就意味着战争和战争的威胁，而且西方国家包括殖民主义国家的代表也表示了同样的意见。
    法国进步共和联盟总书记埃马尼埃·达斯迪埃—德拉维热里在开幕会议上说：“继续保持殖民主义，想出新的主义企图迫使其它国家处于经济、政治和军事上被保护的地位——这些东西本身就包含着战争的种子。”
    意大利代表卢查托指出了同反殖民主义运动团结一致的重要性。他说：“如果一切应该得到自由和已经取得生存和独立的基本权利的人们一致同意实现和平和保持和平，和平就可以实现。”他说：“老的殖民主义在它努力使它的统治权永远保持下去的各个地方，都造成了对和平的威胁。”他指出：“在北非和中东，一种新殖民主义正在直接进行活动。这种殖民主义虽然在渗入和剥削上使用新的方法，但是已经显示出同老的殖民主义毫无区别的强力和威吓手段。”他特别提到装备原子核武器的美国第六舰队在地中海的行动。他的这段话得到热烈欢迎和支持。
    加拿大代表文幼章也发表了明确的意见。他说，科伦坡会议是锡兰独立以来第一次在锡兰举行的大规模国际和平会议。这个事实“可以被看作是有象征性的，因为独立以后就会产生和平愿望，同时没有独立和一切人的福利是不会有巩固的和平的。”
    美国代表斯各特·尼林说，美国所奉行的在南亚和非洲进行经济、政治和军事扩张的政策，是战争危险的因素之一。
    在讨论中，许多代表对美国的中东政策和准备原子战争的活动提出批评和表示不安。日本、朝鲜、中国和阿拉伯国家的代表，特别要求大家注意美国在冲绳、南朝鲜和台湾所设置的导弹基地，注意美国在中东地区所进行的干涉，这种干涉是目前对和平的最大威胁。
    许多国家的代表主张恢复中国在联合国机构中的席位，郭沫若在11日的发言中对他们的正直的主张表示谢意。会议还要继续进行两天。
