Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 12th: Hanoi newspapers today published a letter written by Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on June 8th. In this letter, Pham Van Dong requested the two chairmen to take effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and strictly implemented, and that the South Vietnamese authorities cease all actions that violate the military and political principles of the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong pointed out in the letter that the implementation of the Geneva Accords is facing new and serious difficulties due to the increasingly intensified sabotage activities of the Southern authorities.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference made the following recommendations on May 8, 1956: that the relevant parties in Vietnam respect and continue to implement the Geneva Accords in order to consolidate peace and realize the reunification of Vietnam; that the governments of North and South Vietnam must submit reports to the two chairmen regarding consultations between the two sides and the determination of the date for holding general elections; and that the International Supervisory and Control Commission and the Vietnam Joint Commission must continue to operate on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

In his letter, Pham Van Dong listed many facts demonstrating that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made great efforts to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and to realize the recommendations of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. At the same time, he emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities, since the two chairmen made their recommendations, have intensified the expansion of their military forces and continued to illegally import large numbers of American military personnel and new war materials. Currently, the United States controls the supervision of the South Vietnamese army and military institutions. The South Vietnamese authorities continue to establish new military bases in the areas under their control and strengthen their relations with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Pham Van Dong then pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' acts of terror and persecution against former resistance members and patriotic people are becoming more and more severe. This behavior is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords, especially Article 14(c) of the agreement. As the International Supervisory and Control Commission has reported to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the South Vietnamese authorities do not recognize the International Commission's interpretation of the value of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords and refuse to cooperate with the International Commission in resolving issues related to this article. Regarding the issue of Vietnamese reunification, the South Vietnamese authorities have not yet submitted concrete proposals to the two chairmen regarding consultations between the two sides and the determination of the date for general elections, in accordance with the recommendations made by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8, 1956, and continue to reject the proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding consultations between the two sides, the determination of the date for general elections, and the restoration of normal relations between the two regions. Pham Van Dong said: It is clear that the South Vietnamese authorities are pursuing the policies of the United States, not only failing to continue implementing the Geneva Accords in accordance with the recommendations of the two chairmen, but instead increasingly devoting themselves to undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords and actively realizing their conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam and prepare for a new war. These actions pose a threat to the consolidation of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

### 范文同致函日内瓦会议两位主席  要求采取措施贯彻日内瓦协议

　　范文同致函日内瓦会议两位主席
　　要求采取措施贯彻日内瓦协议
    新华社河内12日电  河内各报今天刊载了越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同在6月8日写给日内瓦会议两位主席的信件。范文同在这封信里要求两位主席采取有效措施，来使日内瓦协议得到尊重和严格的履行，并且使南越政权停止一切违反日内瓦协议的军事条款和政治原则条款的行为。
    范文同在信中指出，由于南方政权日益加紧进行破坏活动，日内瓦协议的履行正在遭到新的、严重的困难。
    范文同指出，日内瓦会议两位主席在1956年5月8日曾经提出下列建议：越南有关双方尊重和继续履行日内瓦协议，以巩固和平和实现越南国家的统一；越南北、南两地区的政府必须向两位主席就双方进行协商和确定举行普选的日期提出报告；国际监督和监察委员会以及越南联合委员会必须在日内瓦协议的基础上继续活动。
    范文同在信中列举了许多事实，说明越南民主共和国政府已经作出很大努力，争取使日内瓦协议继续得到履行，并且使日内瓦会议两位主席的建议得到实现。同时，他强调指出，南越政权方面却在两位主席的建议提出以后，变本加厉地扩充军事力量，继续非法运入大量的美国军事人员和新的战争物资。目前，美国掌握着对南越军队和军事机构的监督权。南越政权继续在它所控制的地区建立新的军事基地，并且加强同东南亚条约组织的关系。
    范文同接着指出，南越政权对前抗战人员和爱国人民的恐怖残害行为日甚一日。这种行为完全违反日内瓦协定，特别是这项协定的第十四条丙款的规定。正如国际监督和监察委员会向日内瓦会议两位主席所报告的，南越政权不承认国际委员会对日内瓦协定第十四条丙款的价值的看法，并且拒绝与国际委员会合作，来解决同这项条款有关的问题。关于越南统一问题，南越政权直到现在还没有按照日内瓦会议两位主席1956年5月8日提出的建议，向他们就越南双方进行协商和确定普选日期等问题提出具体建议，并且继续拒绝越南民主共和国政府提出的关于双方进行协商、确定普选日期和恢复两个地区之间正常关系等问题的建议。范文同说：很明显，南越政权奉行着美国的政策，不仅没有按照两位主席的建议继续执行日内瓦协议，反而日益致力于破坏日内瓦协议的履行，积极实现它长期分裂越南、准备新战争的阴谋。这些行为，对巩固越南和东南亚的和平是一种威胁。
