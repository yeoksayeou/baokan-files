Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st: The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting today to discuss Japan's attitude towards Britain's unilateral relaxation of embargoes against China. The meeting decided that the Japanese government should mediate between Britain, the United States, and other relevant countries to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved.

The cabinet meeting also decided that a concrete plan should be decided upon in future meetings so that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi can request the United States to accept it during his visit to the United States.

Japanese Acting Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii explained the Japanese government's "mediation" attitude to the press after the cabinet meeting. He said that if Britain decides to withdraw from the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), the committee is in danger of collapsing. From the point of view of striving to maintain the coordination of the "free world bloc," this is a major problem. Ishii indicated that the Japanese government will not make a final decision on the embargo issue until Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to Washington in June.

Minister of International Trade and Industry, Mikio Mizuta, said after the meeting that if it is indeed impossible to maintain the coordination of the "free world," Japan may take measures to relax restrictions on exports to China.

According to Kyodo News, opinions within the Japanese government are not consistent. The Japanese government is in a dilemma.

    怕英国抢生意又不敢开罪美国
    日本政府打算采取调停态度
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天举行内阁会议，讨论了日本对英国单独放宽对中国的禁运的态度。会议决定，日本政府要在英国、美国和其他有关国家中间进行调解，以便找出使全体有关国家都能满意的解决办法。
    内阁会议还决定，今后还要开会决定一个具体方案，以便由日本首相岸信介在访问美国时，要求美国接受。
    日本临时代理首相石井光次郎在内阁会议后向报界说明了日本政府的“调解”的态度。他说，如果英国决定退出巴黎统筹委员会，这个委员会在事实上有崩溃的危险。从力求保持“自由国家集团”的协调这一观点来看，这是一个重大问题。石井表示，在岸信介首相6月间访问华盛顿以前，日本政府将不会对禁运问题作出最后决定。
    通商产业相水田三喜男在会后说，如果确实不能保持“自由国家”的协调，日本可能采取放宽对中国的禁运限制的措施。
    据共同社透露，日本政府内部的意见并不是一致的。日本政府正处在进退两难的境地。
