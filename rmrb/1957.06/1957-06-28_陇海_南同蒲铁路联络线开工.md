Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 27th: Construction of the Longhai-South Tongpu Railway connecting line, which will link the railways of Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, began in mid-June.

After this connecting line is opened to traffic, passengers traveling between Shanxi and Shaanxi can take a train across the border. In particular, coal from Shanxi Province supporting the Northwest will no longer have to be transshipped via the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and enter Tongguan from the Longhai Line, shortening the transportation distance by more than 800 kilometers. Some of the coal will also no longer need to cross the Yellow River into Shaanxi from the Tongguan ferry, reducing the per-ton ferry cost from five yuan to about five fen.

Originally, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces were only separated by the Yellow River within Tongguan. The river here is wide and the current is rapid, and historically, transportation has relied on ferries at the famous Fengling Ferry. This year, due to the ongoing construction of a double track between Luoyang and Shanzhou on the Longhai Railway, and the increase in the amount of Shanxi coal supporting the Northwest, the railway transportation department considered that floating bridges and tugboat transportation at Fengling Ferry involved difficult loading and unloading, and therefore decided to build this connecting line.

### 陇海—南同蒲铁路联络线开工

　　陇海—南同蒲铁路联络线开工
    据新华社西安27日电  把陕西和山西两省的铁路联接起来的陇海——南同蒲铁路联络线的工程，已经在6月中旬动工修筑。
    这条联络线通车以后，来往山西、陕西之间的旅客就可以坐上火车过境；特别是山西省支援西北的煤炭，就可以不辗转绕行石太线、京汉线和从陇海线进入潼关，缩短八百多公里的运输里程；一部分煤还可以不再从潼关境内的黄河渡口入陕，每吨渡河运费从五元降低到五分左右。
    原来陕西和山西两省之间在潼关境内只隔一黄河。这里河宽水急，历来交通都是利用著名的风陵渡口以木船摆渡。今年，铁路运输部门因陇海铁路洛阳到陕州之间正在修筑复线，而晋煤支援西北的运量又增加，考虑到原在风陵渡架浮桥和利用拖轮运输，搬、卸困难较多，因而决定修筑这条联络线。
