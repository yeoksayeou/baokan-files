This newspaper, Xi'an, 23rd dispatch: Currently, the struggle by people of all strata in Shaanxi Province against the anti-socialist words and deeds of rightist elements is gradually moving into a deeper stage. In the Shaanxi area, rightist elements, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, spread many malicious reactionary statements. Wang Jiesan, Standing Committee Member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), blatantly slandered Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members at a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC on June 8th, saying, "In recent years, among the Party and League members admitted to schools, bad students outnumber good students," and the Party committee "not only grants them privileges, but also entrusts them with special missions," "'Walls' and 'trenches' are mostly built and dug by them." He also falsely accused activists and democratic figures of being "new nobles" who "laid barbed wire" between the Party and the masses. In addition, Wang Jiesan also said that the current "personnel system is too rigid and is a breeding ground for bureaucracy," while wantonly distorting and slandering the socialist system and other issues. He also tried his best to embellish the anti-socialist and anti-Communist Party leadership speeches of Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi, saying that they were merely "deviations in viewpoints and overly激烈的语气," while regarding the speeches of Lu Yuwen and others as "too sophisticated and trying to ingratiate themselves with the Party." He said that those with biased views and overly激烈的语气 were more honest than those who seized the opportunity to ingratiate themselves. Kang Xinzai, Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, when arranging how to help the Party rectify its work style at a meeting of grassroots cadres of the Democratic League, even called on those who had suffered "grievances" in previous movements to "have grievances redressed, have revenge taken," "pour out bitterness," and "settle old scores," instigating the Democratic League organization to embark on an anti-socialist road. Wang Zunyi (member of the Democratic League), a lecturer at Shaanxi Normal University, made even more blatant reactionary remarks, saying that the "three evils" should be excavated from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In order to oppose today's people's democratic system, Wang Zunyi even compared today's political system to the feudal rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, and also used the ancient Qin Shihuang's "burning books and burying scholars," "those who discussed poetry and books were executed," and "those who affirmed the ancient and negated the present were exterminated" to slander the Party's leadership.

   The reactionary remarks of the rightist elements aroused a counterattack from the broad masses of people in all strata of Shaanxi. Starting from the 11th of this month, workers and staff of state-owned and joint state-private factories and enterprises in the Shaanxi area held discussion meetings one after another, using the achievements of industrial production and construction, and the specific situation of the improvement of workers' political status and economic life, to forcefully refute those anti-socialist remarks. Subsequently, various democratic parties, people's organizations, universities and colleges, and some agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Xi'an also held discussion meetings one after another to refute the rightist remarks.

   The Socialist Righteousness of the Masses is Rising, and the Struggle Continues to Deepen

   People from all walks of life in Xi'an also wrote letters to local newspapers to refute the reactionary remarks of the rightists. Under the criticism of the broad masses of the people, some rightist elements still adopted a stubborn attitude. For example, Wang Zunyi was very rude at the symposium held by the League organization of the Normal University, believing that the symposium was "encircling and suppressing" him. Wang Jiesan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang also made many attempts to defend his reactionary views. However, no matter how stubbornly the rightist elements resisted, their reactionary remarks had lost their market, and the people's socialist righteousness was rising day by day. All agencies, organizations, and factory workers, as well as students in schools, generally believe that this struggle against the rightists is a very vivid political lesson, enabling them to draw a clear line in their thinking with reactionary viewpoints. Some people said that in the past, their understanding of the Party's call for the people of the whole country to unite and build socialism was very superficial, and it was only after this anti-rightist struggle that they realized it profoundly.

   After Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published in the newspapers, it further encouraged the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in the struggle against the rightist elements. People generally believe that Chairman Mao's speech is a powerful weapon for fighting the rightists, making people more aware of the great significance of the struggle against the rightists. At present, the heads of Party organizations in various universities and colleges have made a review report to all staff members of the schools on the shortcomings in their past leadership work, affirmed that most of the opinions put forward by non-Party personnel are correct, and some problems that can be solved have been solved, and some problems that need to be studied have been handed over to special groups for research. In this way, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members has become closer, and the rightists have become more isolated. The struggle of the democratic parties against the reactionary remarks of the rightists has also gradually deepened into the grassroots organizations. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Democratic League held a symposium for the chairmen of the League branches, propaganda and education committee members, and persons in charge of directly affiliated groups in the past two days. Some League branches also held general meetings of League members to expose and criticize the reactionary remarks of Kang Xinzai and others.

   Wang Jiesan Viciously Insults Non-Party Progressive Personages

   His Political Views are Inherently the Same as Zhang Bojun's

   At the symposium held by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang from the 17th to the 19th, many people forcefully refuted Wang Jiesan's anti-socialist remarks. Si Yizhong, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that Wang Jiesan is a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang and wants to engage in united front work. But he calls non-Party members who are close to the Party "new nobles." Does Wang Jiesan agree with the united front or oppose it? Si Yizhong also criticized Wang Jiesan's slander of the personnel system. He said that our country's personnel system is good, and it is possible that some cadres have shortcomings in its implementation. According to Wang Jiesan's statement, does opposing bureaucracy today mean overturning the country's personnel system? Hao Zhaoxian, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that Wang Jiesan falsely accused non-Party members who are close to the Party organization as "new nobles," which is an insult to non-Party progressive personages. According to him, shouldn't no one actively approach the Party? Wang Jurong, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, pointed out in his speech that Wang Jiesan scolded those who tell the truth, do good deeds, and approach the Party as flattering and dishonest; but called those who say reactionary things or even try to do bad things "loyal." According to him, we all have to tell lies. Wang Jurong said that we must firmly stand on the side of truth and socialism, tell the truth, oppose telling lies, and oppose all words and deeds that slander the working people. Cao Zhilin, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that Wang Jiesan proposed that agencies and schools could be "jointly managed in competition" by the Party and non-Party members. Looking at this suggestion, it is precisely to deny the dictatorship of the proletariat and deny the leading role of the Party. Isn't this in the same vein as the "Political Design Institute" proposed by Zhang Bojun?

   Zhao Daiqing, a counselor of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, said that Wang Jiesan compared the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which was influenced by Western bourgeois democracy. Zhao Daiqing said that Wang Jiesan is a great disciple of Hu Shi. After liberation, he often heard Wang Jiesan talk about his thoughts being influenced by Hu Shi. Today, he should examine the ideological source from this aspect.

   What are Kang Xinzai's intentions? Why does he openly undermine the comradely friendship between the Party and members of the Democratic League?

   At the second session of the Second Xi'an Municipal People's Congress on the 19th of this month, Sun Zunwu (member of the Democratic League) revealed that at a meeting convened by the Municipal Committee of the Democratic League on May 21 to arrange how to help the Party rectify its work style, Kang Xinzai, when talking about what attitude the Democratic League should hold, incited League members to "settle old accounts," "pour out bitterness," and "have grievances redressed, have revenge taken." Sun Zunwu said that Kang Xinzai's absurd remarks, when transmitted to the League members, will inevitably cause great confusion in the thinking of the League members, and the impact is incalculable. Because the slogan "have grievances redressed, have revenge taken" means asking the enemy to repay blood debts. Isn't this taking the method of dealing with the enemy to deal with our leading party? After Kang Xinzai's fallacies were exposed, they aroused the unparalleled indignation of the delegates present. Therefore, in the speeches at the conference the next day (20th), the delegates criticized Kang Xinzai's absurd remarks. Hu Jingru (member of the Democratic League) said, I want to ask delegate Kang Xinzai, who has grievances and has not redressed them, and who has revenge and has not taken it with the Communist Party? Hu Jingru also revealed that at a Democratic League symposium, when a League member requested that the Provincial and Municipal Committees of the Democratic League should express their attitude and draw a line in thinking with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, he actually said: "The Party is being rectified, but the League is being rectified instead?" Hu Jingru questioned: Why did Kang Xinzai encourage League members to redress grievances and take revenge on the Communist Party when arranging how to help the Party rectify its work style for League members? Who did these words represent? What is the position? What is the intention? Delegates Ma Wangu and Wang Dehui asked: Were Kang Xinzai's fallacies instructed by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, intentionally opposing the cause of the working people? Asking Kang Xinzai to answer. Delegate Han Zhiying said that Kang Xinzai actually used such a position to arrange work for League members, making League members hostile to the Party, weakening the Party's leadership, and undermining the comradely friendship between the Party and the League. Where does he intend to lead the political direction of the League? Han Zhiying finally represented the 26 League members of the Fifth Middle School Branch of the Democratic League in resolutely opposing Kang Xinzai's anti-communist fallacies. During the conference of delegates, the presidium also received letters and phone calls from grassroots organizations and League members of the Democratic League, not allowing right-wing ambitious elements to use the Democratic League organization as a market for them to spread reactionary remarks, and requesting Kang Xinzai to express his attitude to the delegates at the conference.

### 反右派斗争是非常生动的政治课  陕西各阶层群众觉悟更加提高，右派分子更加孤立

    反右派斗争是非常生动的政治课
    陕西各阶层群众觉悟更加提高，右派分子更加孤立
    本报西安23日电　目前，陕西省各阶层人民对右派分子的反社会主义的言行的斗争，正逐步走向深入阶段。陕西地区的右派分子在帮助党整风的外衣下，散布了很多恶毒的反动言论。民革陕西省委常务委员王捷三在中共陕西省委统战部6月8日召开的座谈会上，明目张胆地污蔑共产党员和共青团员，他说：“近几年来学校吸收的党、团员中，坏学生多于好学生”，党委对他们“既给予以特权，又付以特务”，“‘墙’、‘沟’多半是他们筑、掘的”。他还诬蔑积极分子和民主人士为“新贵”，是他们在党和群众之间“撒下了铁丝网”。此外，王捷三还说现在“人事制度太死硬，是养成官僚主义的温床之一”，同时对社会主义制度等问题肆意作了歪曲和诬蔑。他并且竭力为储安平、葛佩琦的反社会主义、反对共产党的领导的言论作粉饰，说这只是“观点偏差，语气过激”，而对卢郁文等人发表的言论，则说成是“世故太深，借机向党献媚”。他说，观点偏差、语气过激的人要比借机献媚的人老实些。民盟西安市委主任委员亢心栽在民盟基层干部会议上布置如何帮助党整风的时候，竟然号召在历次运动中受了“委屈”的人要“有冤伸冤，有仇报仇”，“吐苦水”，“算旧账”。煽动民盟组织走上反社会主义的道路。陕西省师范学院讲师王尊一（盟员）的反动言论更加露骨，他说：“三害”应向党中央和毛主席那里挖掘。王尊一为了反对今天的人民民主制度，竟把今天的政治制度比作元朝、清朝的封建统治制度，并且还用古代秦始皇的“焚书坑儒”、“偶语者弃市”、“谈论诗书者斩首”和“是古非今者灭族”等来污蔑党的领导。
    右派分子的反动言论引起了陕西地区各阶层广大群众的反击。从本月11日起，陕西地区的国营和公私合营工厂、企业的职工，纷纷举行座谈会，以工业生产和建设的成绩，以工人政治地位和经济生活提高的具体情况，有力地驳斥了那些反社会主义的言论。随着，各民主党派、各人民团体、高等学校以及西安郊区部分农业社，也纷纷举行了座谈会，驳斥右派言论。
    群众社会主义正气高涨斗争继续深入
    西安市各阶层人民还纷纷写信给当地报纸，驳斥右派反动言论。在广大人民的指斥之下，有的右派分子仍采取顽抗态度。如王尊一在师范学院盟组织召开的座谈会上态度很粗暴，认为座谈会是对他进行“围剿”。民革的王捷三也多方为自己的反动观点辩解。但是，不管右派分子如何顽抗，他们的反动言论已失掉了市场，人民的社会主义正气日益高涨。各机关、团体以及各工厂职工，学校里的学生，普遍地认为这次反击右派的斗争是一次非常生动的政治课，使自己在思想上与反动观点划清了界限。有的人说，过去对党号召全国人民团结起来建设社会主义这句话，了解的很肤浅，经过这次反右派斗争，才体会得深刻了。
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演在报纸上发表以后，更加鼓舞了各阶层人民对右派分子斗争的热情。人们普遍地认为毛主席的讲演是向右派分子斗争的有力武器，使人们更加明确了对右派分子斗争的重大意义。目前，各高等学校党组织负责人对过去领导工作中的缺点，向各校全体工作人员进行了一次检查报告，肯定了大多数非党人士提的意见是正确的，有些能够解决的问题已经解决了，有些需要研究的问题，交给了专门小组进行研究。这样，使得党与非党的关系更加密切了，右派分子更加孤立了。各民主党派反击右派反动言论的斗争，也逐步深入到基层组织中去。民盟西安市委近两天举行了各盟支部主任委员、宣教委员、直属小组负责人的座谈会，有的盟支部还举行了盟员大会，对亢心栽等的反动言论进行揭发和批判。
    王捷三恶毒侮辱党外进步人士
    他的政治主张同章伯钧一脉相承
    在17日到19日民革陕西省委员会召开的座谈会上，很多人对王捷三的反社会主义的言论作了有力驳斥。民革成员司以忠说，王捷三是省民革常委，要搞统战工作。但他把靠拢党的党外人士说成是“新贵”，究竟王捷三是同意统一战线还是反对呢？司以忠还批驳了王捷三对人事制度的诬蔑。他说，我们国家的人事制度是好的，可能有些干部在执行中有缺点。照王捷三的说法，今天反对官僚主义是不是要把国家的人事制度推翻掉呢？民革陕西省委委员郝兆先说，王捷三把靠拢党组织的人和党外人士诬蔑为“新贵”，这是对党外进步人士的侮辱。照他说，不是谁也不应该积极靠拢党接近党吗？民革中委王菊人在发言中指出，王捷三骂说实话做好事接近党的人是献媚，不老实；把说反动话甚至企图做坏事的人却叫做“忠实”。照他的说法，我们都得说假话。王菊人说，我们必须坚决地站在真理和社会主义的立场这一面，说实话，反对说假话，反对一切诬蔑劳动人民的言行。民革中委曹志麟说，王捷三提出机关学校可由党与非党“分掌竞赛”。这个意见戳穿来看，正是要否认无产阶级专政，否认党的领导作用。这和章伯钧所提“政治设计院”不正是一脉相承吗？
    陕西省人民委员会参事赵岱青说，王捷三把全国人民代表大会和全国政协比作众议院、参议院，这是受了西方资产阶级民主的影响。赵岱青说，王捷三是胡适的大弟子，解放后常常听到王捷三谈到他的思想受到胡适影响，今天他应当从这方面检查思想根源。
    亢心栽是何居心，为什么公开破坏党和盟的同志友谊？
    在本月19日的西安市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，孙尊武（盟员）代表揭发了亢心栽在5月21日民盟市委召集各支部主任委员布置如何帮助党整风的会议上，谈到民盟应持什么态度时，煽动盟员“算旧账”、“吐苦水”、“有冤伸冤，有仇报仇”。孙尊武说，亢心栽这种荒谬言论传达到盟员中去，必然在盟员思想上造成很大混乱，影响是无法估计的。因为“有冤伸冤，有仇报仇”这种口号，是意味着向敌人讨还血债的，这不是把对付敌人的办法拿来对付我们的领导党吗？亢心栽的谬论被揭发出来以后，引起了到会代表的无比愤慨，因此，在第二天（20日）大会发言中，代表们纷纷批驳了亢心栽的荒谬言论。胡景儒（盟员）代表说，我要问亢心栽代表，什么人和共产党有冤没有伸，有仇尚未报？胡景儒还揭发了亢心栽在一次民盟座谈会上，有一个盟员要求民盟省、市委应表示态度和章伯钧、罗隆基划清思想界限的时候，他竟说：“整党呢，却整起盟来了？”胡景儒提出质问：亢心栽向盟员布置如何帮助党整风，为什么要鼓动盟员向共产党伸冤报仇？这话是代表什么人说的？是什么立场？企图是什么？马婉姑代表和王德慧代表提出：亢心栽的谬论是不是受了章伯钧、罗隆基的指示，有意反对劳动人民的事业？要求亢心栽答复。韩志颖代表说，亢心栽竟以这样的立场向盟员布置工作，使盟员仇视党，削弱党的领导，破坏党和盟的同志友谊，究竟要把盟的政治方向引向何处去？韩志颖最后代表民盟西安市第五中学支部二十六个盟员，坚决反对亢心栽这种反共谬论。在代表大会会议进行中，主席团还收到了民盟基层组织和盟员的来信和电话，不允许右派野心分子利用民盟组织作他们进行散布反动言论的市场，并要求亢心栽在大会上向代表们表明态度。
