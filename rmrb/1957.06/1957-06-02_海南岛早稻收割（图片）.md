    Early Rice Harvest on Hainan Island
    Wanning County, the rice production center of Hainan Island, has begun harvesting early rice. Good news of bumper harvests are frequently reported from agricultural production cooperatives in various locations. From the more than 3,000 mu of grain harvested since early May, yields are at least 30% higher than last year. Currently, farmers are working intensely on harvesting, plowing, sowing, and transplanting mid-season and late-season crops, ensuring a bumper harvest of early crops while also striving for large bumper harvests of mid-season and late-season crops.
    The picture below shows members of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanning County harvesting early rice. The average yield per mu of early rice harvested by the Heping Cooperative has reached 808 jin.

    海南岛早稻收割
    海南岛的水稻生产中心——万宁县已开始收割早稻。各地农业生产合作社丰收喜讯频传，从5月初已收割的三千多亩谷子来看，最少比去年增产三成。现在，农民们在紧张地进行收割、犁田、播种、插中造和晚造，既保证早造丰收，同时，也争取中造和晚造大丰收。
