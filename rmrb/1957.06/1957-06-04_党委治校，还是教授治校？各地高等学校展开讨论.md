Party Committee Leadership or Professor Governance?
Discussions Unfold in Universities Across the Country
Zhu Binghai says that Marxism-Leninism cannot replace professional expertise; schools should be run by those with expertise.
Since the start of the rectification campaign at Nanjing University, the Party Committee has invited teachers to several symposiums, initially revealing the contradictions between Party members and non-Party members at the university.

Many professors have expressed differing opinions on the issue of Party Committee leadership versus professor governance. Some professors believe that at Nanjing University, it cannot yet be said to be Party Committee leadership, but rather somewhat like "section chief governance." Professor Zhu Binghai, head of the Department of Meteorology, said that the university's major policy decisions are decided by a few section chiefs. The university affairs meeting has one to two hundred people who just listen to reports. The administrative meetings are also filled with reports from the leaders, which are often very long, exhausting people, and then the meeting adjourns. How can such meetings lead to discussion? How can they give play to the role of the masses? Professor Zhang Zu of the Department of Geology said that the Party and government are not separated, and the Party substitutes for the government. The academic committee in the school cannot play its role. Lecturer Xu Nainan believes that the slogan of professor governance is inappropriate. He said that professors are treasures, and it would be a pity to let them manage administration. For example, Mr. Gao Jiyu is a famous expert in organic chemistry, and if he manages administration, teaching and research work will be affected, and the same is true for Mr. Fan Cunzhong. Can the role of the school committee be brought into play? Is it necessary for Mr. Gao and Mr. Fan to do administrative work in the school? I don't think it's necessary. The leadership of the Party Committee is not bad, but there are too few people in the Party Committee who understand the profession. Some people who understand the profession should be brought in. Combine the leadership of the Party Committee with professor governance, and do not separately propose professor governance. There was also a professors' association before liberation, but its effect was not good. He hopes for the leadership of the Party Committee, but that democracy should be promoted. Professor Zhu Binghai proposed "governance by experts." He said that Marxism-Leninism cannot replace professional expertise. But now, people who do not understand the profession can decide everything, and force others to implement it, which is not right. Party Committee governance is Party Committee policy governance, not Party member governance.

Yan Changtai says that the Party Committee should further unite veteran professors.
The Shandong University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited the heads of democratic parties at the university to a symposium.

Associate Professor Yan Changtai of the Chemistry Department said that he felt that the Party Committee was passive in its work. In the future, the Party Committee should carefully consider the characteristics of the university and how to run a comprehensive university well under such geographical conditions. He said that the university had not done enough to unite veteran professors. The establishment of the Scientific Research Office strengthened scientific research work and brought into play the role of veteran professors, but it was only one aspect of unity. The university should also strengthen other aspects of unity, because veteran professors also have a lot of other experience. The school committee should establish a standing committee and absorb some veteran professors to participate in design and research, so that the Party Committee is responsible and the veteran professors are combined.

Associate Professor Liu Panxi of the Chinese Department said that the merger of Shandong University and Huadong University strengthened the strength, which is a good thing. But there are also side effects. The leading cadres of the revolutionary university do not understand the characteristics of the old-style university. Therefore, many people say that they are running an old-style university with the attitude of running a revolutionary university. The understanding of the feelings of veteran professors is not deep enough, so there is a "left" bias in some aspects. Self-education of veteran teachers is necessary, but helping them improve has not grasped the characteristics, obliterating their small progress. There are achievements, but they have been destroyed by negative effects. Many teachers have been hurt in their hearts, and the Party Committee should bear the main responsibility. In the past, only someone's backwardness was seen, and his achievements were not seen, and his enthusiasm could not be brought into play. There is no problem with the Party's policies and guidelines and ideological and political leadership of the school. For professional leadership, it is not to do professional work, but it must also understand the profession. As long as you work hard to learn, you will understand the profession. Knowing only the policy and not the profession cannot be well integrated with reality, and the problem will not be solved well or thoroughly. The masses will welcome the Party's ability to speak professionally. There is no doubt that the Party can lead the profession. If it understands the profession, it can lead it better.

Liu Peide says to combine the leadership of the Party Committee and the Faculty Affairs Committee.
Teachers of Dalian Institute of Technology talked about the Party Committee system at a symposium convened by the Party Committee.

Professor Liu Peide said that the necessity of Party leadership is unquestionable. The question is what to lead. I think the Party's leadership is mainly reflected in the guidelines and policies, ideological education, and the exemplary role played by the specific actions of Party members. For specific measures, it is better for those responsible for specific work to do it. If the Party leads too specifically, it will not be easy to combine with the actual situation, and at the same time, it will hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. But this does not mean that the Party Committee cannot intervene in specific affairs. On the contrary, the Party Committee should go deep into the lower levels to discover problems and make suggestions. But this is only a suggestion, not an instruction. For example, I think that the provisions on strengthening the class instructor system in the resolution of the Party Congress are too specific, because there are still disputes about these issues. Why make a conclusion so early and stipulate it so mechanically. Secondly, the scope of authority of the Faculty Affairs Committee should be strengthened. I think that all major events, such as the overall planning of the college, basic construction, work plans, etc., should be decided by the Faculty Affairs Committee, not just for the dean's reference. The Faculty Affairs Committee can only discuss some major issues, and the dean needs to solve many problems in the specific implementation, which does not hinder the dean's ability to play. I think combining the leadership of the Party Committee and the Faculty Affairs Committee has the following advantages: (1) avoid the shortcomings of the dean having the final say and not following the mass line; (2) avoid staff politics on major issues; (3) give play to the enthusiasm of faculty and staff; (4) the Party Committee can strengthen ideological work.

I think that contacting the masses is not only about establishing an ideological reporting system with the masses, but more importantly, being able to consult with the masses on major issues and be able to meet each other ideologically.

Shen Peilin says that the Party Committee can lead the school, but it should conduct in-depth research on the profession.
More than fifty professors and associate professors of Beijing Institute of Technology actively criticized and helped the Institute Party Committee rectify its work at a symposium convened by the Institute Party Committee.

During the symposium, everyone believed that the bureaucracy and sectarianism in the Party Committee's leadership were important reasons for not being able to run the school well. The manifestation of bureaucracy is mainly that the leading comrades of the Party Committee do not understand teaching business, nor do they humbly learn and study teaching business in depth. The problem of how the Party should adopt to lead the school has not been resolved. Therefore, although there are many administrative cadres in the institute, they cannot do a good job in teaching. Professor Shen Peilin said, based on my own experience, the Party can lead the school well, but how the responsible comrades of the Party Committee should conduct in-depth research on the profession, and what appropriate methods and ways should be adopted to implement the leadership, is an issue that should be resolved in this rectification movement. He said that because the responsible comrades of the Institute Party Committee are not professional and do not study enough, they do not grasp it tightly. The teaching plans are all formulated behind closed doors by the teaching affairs office, and the result is that they cannot be implemented. Professor Li Zuolin said that because the leaders do not know what to do, we have revised the teaching plan four times last year in order to reduce the burden on students. And each revision has not undergone any on-the-spot teaching experiments. Now some students have proposed to increase the teaching hours. Professor Wang Wenlan said that the teaching and research group is the basic unit of the college's work, and it is also the key to improving and improving the quality of teaching. Because the leaders do not understand our situation, the responsibilities are not clear, and there are multiple leaders. As a result, we cannot carry out teaching and research work. Over time, more and more problems accumulate. Professor Long Jihe suggested that the leading comrades of the Institute Party Committee should leave the office and come down to experience the life of teaching and academic research.

    党委治校，还是教授治校？
    各地高等学校展开讨论
    朱炳海说，马列主义不能代替业务，要内行治校
    南京大学开始整风以来，党委已邀请教师们举行了几次座谈会，初步揭发了学校党和非党之间的矛盾。
    许多教授对于党委领导还是教授治校的问题提出不同意见。有的教授认为在南大还不能说是党委治校，而有点像“科长治校”。气象系主任朱炳海教授说，学校的大政方针决策都由几个科长决定。校务会议一开就是一、二百人，只是听听报告。行政会议也是首长作报告，报告往往又长得很，把人弄得筋疲力尽，只好散会。这种会议如何能进行讨论呢？又如何能发挥群众的作用呢？地质系张祖教授说，党政不分，以党代政。学校里的学术委员会不能发挥作用。徐艿南讲师认为，教授治校的口号不妥当。他说，教授是宝贝，如果让他们去管行政是可惜的。如高济宇先生是有名的有机化学专家，他去管行政，教学研究工作就受影响，范存忠先生也如此。是否能发挥校委会的作用呢？学校中是否一定需要高先生与范先生去做行政工作呢？我看不必要。党委的领导并不坏，只是党委懂得业务的人太少，应该充实些懂业务的人进去。把党委领导与教授治校结合起来，不要单独提出教授治校。解放前也有教授会，但其效果并不好。他希望党委领导，但要发扬民主。朱炳海教授提出“内行治校”。他说，马列主义不能代替业务。而现在却是对业务不了解的人，可以决定一切，并硬要别人执行，这是不对的。党委治校是党委的政策治校，而不是党员治校。
    阎长泰说，党委要进一步团结老教授
    中共山东大学委员会，邀请该校民主党派负责人举行座谈会。
    化学系阎长泰副教授说，我感到党委在工作上很被动，今后，党委应很好考虑学校特点，在这样的地理条件下，如何办好综合大学。他说，学校对老教授团结工作做得不够。科学研究处成立了，加强了科学研究工作，发挥了老教授的作用，只是团结的一个方面。学校还要加强其他方面的团结工作，因为老教授的其他经验也很多。校委会应该成立常委会，吸收一部分老教授参加设计、研究，这样使党委负责和老教授结合。
    中文系刘泮溪副教授说，山东大学和华东大学合并，力量加强了，有好处。但也有副作用，革命大学的领导干部，对旧型大学的特点了解不够。因此，有不少人说以办革命大学的姿态来办旧型大学。对老教授的心情理解不深，因而某些方面有“左”的偏向。老教师的自我教育是必要的，但帮助他们的提高没掌握特点，抹煞其微小的进步。成绩是有的，但被消极作用破坏了。好些教师内心负了伤，党委应负主要责任。过去只认为某人落后，不看到他的成绩，积极性就发挥不了。党对学校的政策方针和思想政治领导没有问题。对业务领导，不是去做业务工作，但也必须懂得业务，只要努力学习，就会懂业务。光知道政策，不懂业务，不能很好结合实际，问题解决也不会好，也不透彻。党委能说内行话，群众一定会欢迎。党能领导业务，不用怀疑，如果懂得业务，就能领导得更好。
    刘培德说，把党委和院务委员会的领导结合起来
    大连工学院的教师们在党委召开的一个座谈会上，谈到党委制的问题。
    刘培德教授说，党的领导的必要性是毋庸置疑的，问题在于领导什么。我认为党的领导主要体现在方针政策、思想教育，以及通过党员的具体行动起模范作用。对于具体措施，还是由负责具体工作的人来做为好。党领导得太具体，反而不容易结合实际情况，同时妨碍群众积极性与创造性的发挥。但这并不等于说，党委不能过问具体事务；相反地，党委应该深入下层发现问题，提出建议。但这仅仅是建议，而不是指示，例如这次在党代会决议中关于加强班指导教师制度的规定，我就觉得过于具体了，因为这些问题大家还有争论，何必这样早做结论，规定得这样机械。其次，应加强院务委员会的职权范围。我认为，凡重大事件，例如全院规划、基本建设、工作计划等，都应由院务委员会决定，不是仅供院长参考。院务委员会只可能讨论一些重大问题，具体执行还有许多问题需要院长解决，并不妨碍院长才能的发挥。我认为把党委和院务委员会的领导结合起来，可以有以下优点：（1）避免院长说了算，不走群众路线的缺点；（2）在重大问题上可以避免科员政治；（3）可以发挥教职工的积极性；（4）党委更可以加强思想工作。
    我认为联系群众不仅在于和群众建立思想汇报制度，更重要的是在重大问题上能和群众商量以及能相互思想见面。
    沈沛霖说，党委能够领导学校，但应深入研究业务
    北京工业学院五十多名教授、副教授，在院党委召开的座谈会上，积极开展批评，帮助院党委整风。
    大家在座谈中，认为党委领导上的官僚主义和宗派主义，是不能把学校办好的重要原因。官僚主义的表现，主要是党委领导同志不懂教学业务，也不谦虚地学习和深入地研究教学业务，对党应采取怎样的方式方法来领导学校的问题没获得解决，因之，院内行政干部虽多，并不能做好教学工作。沈沛霖教授说，我根据自己的经验说，党是可以把学校领导得好的，但是，党委负责同志应如何地深入研究业务，应采取那些适当的方式和方法来贯彻领导，这是在这次整风运动中应该获得解决的问题。他说，由于院党委负责同志对教学业务不内行，研究不够，抓得不紧，教学计划都是由教务处闭门造车制定，结果就行不通。李作霖教授说，因为领导上心中无数，我们为了减轻学生的负担，去年一年就修改了四次教学计划。而每次的修改，并没有经过什么实地的教学实验。现在有的学生又提出要增加教学的时数。教授王文澜说，教研组是学院工作的基础单位，也是改进、提高教学质量的关键所在，因为领导上对我们的情况不了解，职责不分明，多头领导，结果，我们无法进行教学研究工作。天长日久，问题积累多了。龙季和教授建议，院党委领导同志，应该离开办公室，到下面来体验教学与学术研究的生活。
