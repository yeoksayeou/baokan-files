Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 16th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia passed a resolution on the party's ideological work at its plenary session on June 13th and 14th. The resolution stated that the Central Committee believes it is necessary to emphasize the need to combat various manifestations and influences of revisionism.

The resolution believes that the constant combat task of ideological work is to expose the essence of modern imperialist thought. Imperialists have changed their tactics towards socialist countries. One of the main means of their strategy is to carry out ideological activities. They always hope to get the active help of opportunists and revisionists in the working class movement.

The resolution emphasized that when mentioning West Germany's intensification of militarization, it is necessary to point out this serious danger to all the people and keep them at the highest level of vigilance and preparedness.

Persistently Strengthen the Unity of the Socialist Camp

The resolution said, we believe that one of the basic tasks is to: persistently strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, strengthen and expand the cooperation between socialist countries on the basis of proletarian internationalism, on the basis of loyalty to Marxist-Leninist thought and the tradition of the October Revolution. The Central Committee affirmed the achievements made in the contacts and negotiations between socialist countries and fraternal parties, and at the same time believes that it is necessary to further strengthen fraternal relations with each other and conduct more extensive talks to solve the most important political and ideological problems.

Strive to Make All Intellectuals Accept the Marxist Worldview

The resolution then talked about the significance of the party's socialist education among workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and pointed out that the party will continue to work to make all intellectuals accept the Marxist worldview and overcome all remnants of the old era.

Do Not Allow the Struggle Against Bureaucracy to Be Used to Slander the People's Democratic System. The resolution believes that criticizing the shortcomings of society is of particular importance to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through this method, the party often learns from the masses, and the masses also learn from the party. While developing and supporting this criticism in various ways, the party organizations must ensure that the expression of non-socialist criticisms does not incite anti-people and counter-revolutionary elements. An important task of ideological work is to clarify the significance and mission of the people's democratic state, the essence of socialist democracy, and its superiority compared with bourgeois democracy. Do not allow the party's consistent struggle against manifestations of bureaucracy to be used to slander the people's democratic state system.

The resolution emphasized the leading role of the party, and then said that the party's leadership methods must be constantly improved. The broadest ideological and educational work of the party, the state, and all social organizations must be oriented towards all areas of society.

Must Attach Great Importance to the Education of Young People

The resolution emphasized that great importance must be attached to the education of young people. The problem in education is not only to ensure a high level of professional skills, but also to ensure the education and training of conscious intellectuals. The Central Committee will establish a Youth Work Committee, whose task is to prepare relevant materials for the 11th Congress of the CCP.

When talking about literature and art, the resolution said that the party must further care about the socialist development of literature. The party does not allow any form of sectarianism, administrative measures, or the practice of using the party's name to elevate certain artists in the literary and artistic front. The party is very concerned about the development of art in the spirit of socialist realism. The party must realize its leading role in political and ideological issues through party members, through comradely discussions, through the development of theoretical work, and through realistic and principled debates. The potential of cultural and artistic publications has not been fully utilized so far; these publications still have some incorrect political and ideological views and tendencies.

Must Eliminate Dogmatic Phenomena in the Party's Propaganda

The resolution emphasized the prominent position of the party's propaganda in ideological and educational work, and said that party committees and organizations at all levels must eliminate all dogmatic phenomena that weaken the effectiveness of the party's propaganda. The party's propaganda must have a higher degree of principle and revolutionary spirit, and the party's theoretical level must be improved.

　　捷共中央决议加强思想工作
　　必须揭露现代帝国主义思想的本质
　　坚决同修正主义的表现和影响斗争
    新华社布拉格16日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在6月13日和14日的全体会议上通过关于党的思想工作的决议。决议说，中央委员会认为，必须强调对修正主义的各种表现和影响进行斗争的必要性。
    决议认为，思想工作的经常的战斗性任务是揭露现代帝国主义思想的本质。帝国主义者已经改变了他们对社会主义国家的策略。他们的策略的主要手段之一就是进行思想活动。他们总是指望得到工人阶级运动中的机会主义分子和修正主义分子的积极帮助。
    决议在提到西德加紧军国主义化的时候强调说，必须向全体人民指出这种严重危险，并且使他们保持最高度的警惕和戒备。
    坚持不懈地加强社会主义阵营的团结
    决议说，我们认为基本任务之一是：坚持不懈地加强社会主义阵营的团结，在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，在忠于马克思列宁主义思想和十月革命传统的基础上，加强和扩大社会主义阵营各国的合作。中央委员会肯定了社会主义各国以及各国兄弟党之间的接触和谈判所取得的成绩，同时认为必须进一步加强相互间的兄弟关系，进行更广泛的会谈，以解决最重要的政治和思想问题。
    努力使所有知识分子接受马克思主义世界观
    决议接着谈到党在工人、农民和知识分子当中进行社会主义教育的意义，并且指出，党在今后还将努力使所有知识分子接受马克思主义世界观和克服一切旧时代的残余。不让反官僚主义的斗争被利用来
  诽谤人民民主国家制度决议认为，批评社会上的缺点对无产阶级专政具有特殊的重要性。通过这种方法，党经常向群众学习，群众也向党学习。党组织在用各种方法发展和支持这种批评的同时，必须保证非社会主义批评意见的表达不至于把反人民、反革命的分子鼓动起来。思想工作的重要任务是阐明人民民主国家的意义和使命、社会主义民主的实质、它同资产阶级民主相比所具有的优越性。不要让党所一贯进行的反对官僚主义表现的斗争被利用来诽谤人民民主国家制度。
    决议强调指出了党的领导作用，接着说，必须经常改进党的领导方法。党、国家和一切社会组织的最广泛的思想和教育工作必须面向社会的各个领域。
    必须非常重视对青年的教育工作
    决议着重指出，必须非常重视对青年的教育工作。教育中的问题是不仅要保证高度的专业水平，同时还要保证教育和培养有觉悟的知识分子。中央委员会将成立青年工作委员会，它的任务是为捷共第十一次代表大会准备有关这方面的材料。
    决议在谈到文学和艺术时说，党必须进一步关心文学的社会主义发展。缩小文学和艺术战线的任何形式的宗派主义作法、行政措施以及用党的名义来抬高某些艺术家的作法，都是党所不容许的。党非常关切本着社会主义现实主义的精神发展艺术。必须通过共产党员，通过同志式的讨论、通过发展理论工作和通过实事求是的、有原则的辩论来实现党在政治和思想问题上的领导作用。文化和艺术刊物的潜力到现在还没有被充分利用；这些刊物还有着一些不正确的政治思想见解和倾向。
    必须消除党的宣传中的教条主义现象
    决议在强调指出党的宣传在思想和教育工作中的突出地位的时候说，党的各级机关和各级组织必须消除一切削弱党的宣传效果的教条主义现象。党的宣传必须具有更高度的原则性和革命精神，党的理论水平必须提高。
