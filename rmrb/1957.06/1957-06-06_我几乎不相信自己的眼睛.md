Title: I Almost Didn't Believe My Eyes

Reader's Letter

    I almost didn't believe my eyes.
    I am an officer in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I don't understand profound theories, but I know a little common sense. When I saw the speech given by Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at the Renmin University of China, published in the "People's Daily" on May 31, I was dumbfounded. I read it repeatedly, almost not believing my eyes.
    "China is the China of 600 million people, including counter-revolutionaries..."
    I am a soldier, and I know that a soldier's duty is to defend the motherland, and I also know that the motherland for which we are willing to sacrifice our blood is the motherland of 600 million people. However, I never thought that the relatives we protect also include counter-revolutionaries. I also believe that my comrades who hold weapons and guard the borders, coasts, factories, and mines day and night would not think that the relatives we jointly protect also include counter-revolutionaries. When we walk in the park and encounter a group of children who innocently shout, "Hello, Uncle Liberation Army!" we reply, "Hello, children!" and think in our hearts, "We must resolutely defend the motherland and protect your happy life." But, as a People's Liberation Army soldier, when he hears the speech of Lecturer Ge Peiqi, he really doesn't know what to say.
    Lecturer Ge Peiqi also said: "Without the leadership of the Communist Party, people would not sell the country." I don't know who "people" refers to, but I know that: the Qing government ceded land and paid indemnities, selling the country; Yuan Shikai signed the Twenty-One Demands, selling the country; Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance sold the country; Wang Jingwei betrayed the country as a traitor; Chiang Kai-shek is still selling the country in Taiwan now; Lin Yutang, who said that the moon in China is not as good as that in the United States, eventually did not even want to be Chinese... After much calculation, it was only after the establishment of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Communist Party that the ruling class's crimes of selling the country in history ended...
    Writing this, I can't help but wonder who I should make suggestions to. After thinking about it, I still feel that I should make a suggestion to the leaders of the Renmin University of China, hoping that they will strengthen political and ideological education that is related to reality rather than dogmatic in the future. Otherwise, if those who educate others are not educated themselves first, how can they "be a model for others"? What's more, it's been more than seven years since liberation, and yet...
    P.S.: It may be a bit inconvenient for the People's Daily to publish these few hundred words when opening up avenues of speech. But I think in the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," nameless weeds and humble soldiers should also have the right to bloom and contend in a small way.

    我几乎不相信自己的眼睛
    我是一个中国人民解放军军官，高深的理论我不懂，但是普通常识还知道一点。当我看到5月31日“人民日报”发表的中国人民大学葛佩琦讲师的发言，不禁口噤目呆。我反复的看了两遍，几乎不相信自己的眼睛。
    “中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内……”
    我是一个军人，我知道军人的职责是保卫祖国，我也知道我们愿意为之牺牲流血的祖国是六亿人民的祖国。但是，我从没有想到我们所保卫的亲人还包括反革命在内。我还相信，我的那些手执武器日夜守卫在边疆、海防、工厂、矿山的战友们，也不会想到我们所共同保卫的亲人还包括反革命在内。当我们走在公园里遇到一群小朋友，他们天真澜漫地叫着“解放军叔叔好！”我们嘴里回答“小朋友们好！”心里说的是“我们要坚决保卫祖国，保卫你们的幸福生活。”可是，作为一个人民解放军战士，当他听到葛佩琦讲师的发言，心里真不知道该说什么才好。
    葛佩琦讲师还说：“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”，我不知道“人家”指的是谁，但是我知道：满清政府割地赔款卖过国；袁世凯订了二十一条不平等条约卖过国；蒋介石的不抵抗主义卖过国；汪精卫当汉奸卖过国；蒋介石现在在台湾还在卖国；说中国的月亮不及美国好的林语堂最后连中国人也不愿做了。……算来算去，只是在共产党领导的中华人民共和国政府成立以后，才终止了历史上统治阶级的卖国罪行……
    写到这里，我不禁想给谁提点意见才好。想来想去，还是觉得应该给中国人民大学领导上提一个意见，希望他们今后加强一下联系实际的而不是教条主义的政治思想教育。否则，教育人的，自己不先受教育，如何能“为人师表”？何况，解放已经七年多，居然……
    附记：也可能在广开言路的时候，发表这几百字，对人民日报说来有点不便。但我想本着“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的精神，无名的小草小卒也该有权小放小鸣。
