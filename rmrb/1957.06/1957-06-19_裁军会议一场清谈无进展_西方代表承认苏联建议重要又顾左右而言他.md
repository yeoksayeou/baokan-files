　　Xinhua News Agency, June 18th, London Dispatch: At the United Nations Disarmament Commission's subcommittee meeting on the 17th, although Western country representatives unanimously stated that the Soviet proposal regarding the immediate temporary cessation of nuclear weapon testing was an important measure in seeking a partial disarmament agreement, they themselves continued to tread water in this regard.

　　It is reported that the American representative, Stassen, said at the meeting that he could immediately say: the Soviet proposal is an important step toward a partial disarmament agreement, but the United States is currently "still studying" the Soviet proposal.

　　Stassen did not explicitly indicate whether the United States would change its policy on nuclear testing to accommodate the Soviet Union's conciliatory attitude.

　　French representative Moch and Canadian representative Johnson also welcomed the Soviet proposal, but they emphasized issues regarding disarmament supervision.

　　It is noteworthy that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd attended the meeting and served as its chairman. Lloyd, like Stassen, also "praised" the Soviet proposal, but he also said that for some countries, stopping nuclear testing without prohibiting the manufacture of nuclear weapons is "unsatisfactory".

　　Soviet representative Zorin said that he agreed with the assessment that negotiations had reached the stage where the factors of a disarmament agreement should be clarified. He welcomed the fact that Western representatives considered the Soviet proposal important, but he disagreed with the emphasis Western representatives placed on the importance of supervision. He said that an agreement on the scope of supervisory measures could only be reached when it was decided what a disarmament agreement should include.

　　This meeting made no progress due to the fruitless talk of the Western country representatives. The next meeting is scheduled for the 20th.

　　It is reported that Western country representatives are currently stepping up secret talks in order to coordinate strategies and propose counter-proposals to the Soviet proposal.

　　裁军会议一场清谈无进展
　　西方代表承认苏联建议重要又顾左右而言他
    新华社18日讯　伦敦消息：在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会17日会议上，尽管西方国家代表一致表示苏联提出的关于立即暂时停止核武器试验的建议是谋求局部裁军协议的一项重要措施，但是他们自己仍然在这方面踏步不前。
    据报道，美国代表史塔生在会上说，他可以马上说：苏联建议是走向局部裁军协定的一个重要步骤，但是美国目前“还在研究”苏联的建议。
    史塔生没有明确地表示美国是否将改变它在核试验问题上的政策，以求适应苏联的和解态度。
    法国代表莫克和加拿大代表约翰逊也对苏联的建议表示欢迎，不过，他们强调地谈到了关于裁军监督的一些问题。
    值得注意的是英国外交大臣劳埃德参加了会议，并且担任会议的主席。劳埃德也同史塔生一样“称赞”苏联的建议，但是他又说，对某些国家说来，停止核试验而不禁止制造核武器，是“不能令人满意”的。
    苏联代表佐林说，他同意这样一种估计，谈判已经达到应该明确裁军协定的因素的阶段。他对西方国家代表认为苏联建议是重要的这一点表示欢迎，但是他不同意西方代表对监督的重要性所给予的强调。他说，只有在决定了一项裁军协定应该包括什么内容的时候，才能就监督措施的范围取得协议。
    这一次会议因为西方国家代表的清谈而没有取得任何进展。下次会议定在20日举行。
    有消息说，目前西方国家代表正在加紧进行秘密会谈，以便协调策略，对苏联建议提出反建议。
