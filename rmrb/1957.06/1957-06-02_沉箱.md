    Caisson [Note]
    Gan Yongbai

It seems like there was such a legend in ancient times, that the prosperous seabed surpassed the deserts of the human world. Once there was an extraordinary poet who lost his way by the riverbank, wandering and lamenting; unable to bear the loneliness of the human world, he plunged into the river, seeking liberation. Ah! How many seabeds and riverbeds conceal rare treasures, the secrets of the earth. That is just an ancient legend—time has passed, and rivers and seas no longer easily evoke our sorrow and grief. Our poets sing of rivers and oceans, sing of the people's labor uncovering the treasures at the bottom of the water! I have seen drilling machines lifted from the heart of the river, bringing rock layers for scientists to analyze which century they belong to; I have also seen workers enter the "caisson" in the heart of the river, not playing games, but to build bridges on the river!

    [Note] The pneumatic caisson method is a construction method for bridge foundation engineering. Workers operating in the caisson are called caisson workers.

    沉箱〔注〕
    甘永柏仿佛古代有过这么一个传说，繁华的海底胜过人间的沙漠。曾经有一位绝代的诗人，他迷失江畔，低徊哀吟；为了忍受不住人间的寂寞，他竟沉入江心，寻求解脱。呵！多少海底和河底，藏着稀世的珍异，大地的秘密。那只是一个古代的传说——时间已经消逝，江海再不易引起我们的哀伤和悲思。我们的诗人歌唱江河，歌唱海洋，歌唱人民的劳动揭开了水底的宝藏！我曾看到钻探机从江心举起，带来岩层给科学家分析它是属于哪个世纪；我又曾看到工人们进入江心的“沉箱”，不是游戏，而是为了在江上建起桥梁！
    〔注〕压气沉箱法是建筑桥梁基础工程的一种施工方法，在沉箱中操作的工人称曰沉箱手。
