　　Xi Zhongxun said at the closing meeting of the State Council's symposium with non-Party figures:
　　The Communist Party does not welcome anti-socialist remarks; as long as the remarks are beneficial to socialism, even if they are excessive, we welcome them.
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch The symposium on rectification convened by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, for non-Party figures, concluded this afternoon.
    This symposium started on May 29th and has been held twelve times in total. Forty-eight people spoke at the meeting, and six non-Party figures made written statements.
    Xi Zhongxun expressed his gratitude to the non-Party figures at today's meeting. He said that this symposium was very successful, and everyone spoke their minds freely and without reservation. The content of everyone's speeches covered a wide range of aspects, including the relationship between the Party and the government, the legal system, the administrative system, organizational structure and staffing, the division of powers of various departments of the State Council, the remaining issues from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, personnel arrangements, cultural, educational, and health issues, and ideological style. Some of these issues are of a principled nature, and many are specific. The opinions raised by everyone on these issues included reflecting the situation, making suggestions, and, more significantly, criticizing the work of the State Council. This is very good and is what we wholeheartedly welcome.
    Xi Zhongxun said that there are many shortcomings and errors exposed at the symposium, and there is nothing strange about this. The reason why the Communist Party wants to carry out rectification is to expose problems in a concentrated way and solve them through rectification. We have the courage to expose the shortcomings and errors in our work, and we welcome others to expose them. We have the confidence to overcome and correct them. We will not disappoint those friends who offer suggestions, and we will definitely use practical actions to correct our shortcomings and errors to guarantee everyone's confidence. You can see how well we do, and if we don't do well, you can still criticize us.
    Xi Zhongxun said that at this symposium, there were also some incorrect remarks, and even some remarks that deviated from the socialist position and went in the direction of anti-socialism, but this is also beneficial to us. At the same time, it is also beneficial to those who have exposed erroneous ideas. Whether correct or incorrect opinions, they are all enlightening and educational in helping the Party to carry out rectification.
    He said that what the Communist Party does not welcome are anti-socialist remarks. Apart from that, as long as the remarks are beneficial to our work and beneficial to socialist construction, even if they are a bit excessive, we welcome them. Of course, we also understand that it is impossible for everyone's words to be so appropriate, and it is impossible to say everything so appropriately. It is normal for words to be a bit excessive or exaggerated. We should not haggle over these trivial matters, otherwise, we will lose sight of the bigger picture and hinder the improvement of our work.
    Xi Zhongxun said that the greatest gain from this symposium is that we have not lost our direction. Those who attended the meeting quickly clarified this major aspect. Our attitude is: anti-socialist remarks must be refuted because these remarks are harmful to the most basic interests of our people; not only can the Party not agree with these remarks, the people cannot agree with them, and even those who generally agree with socialism cannot agree with them; we must sincerely accept, seriously treat, and earnestly solve the criticisms and suggestions regarding our work.
    He said that it now seems that there must be debate during the "blooming and contending," and there must also be debate after the "blooming and contending." This is the inevitable process of understanding problems. Without debate, it would be acknowledging that what is right is right, and what is wrong is also right. Debate is not a bad thing. After debate, the truth will eventually be revealed. In the debate, our attitude must be clear. We must first have a major debate about right and wrong. Only by clearly distinguishing between major right and wrong can we distinguish between minor right and wrong. The so-called major right and wrong is the issue of stance: whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road? Without this stance, it will be difficult to distinguish between right and wrong, which will only harm rectification and will not help it.
    When talking about the relationship between the Party and the government, Xi Zhongxun said that joint instructions from the Party and the government on major policy issues are only beneficial and not harmful; for example, the recent issue of summer harvest distribution work, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued joint instructions. This is because it is necessary not only for all the people to know but especially for Communist Party members to understand the policy and implement it. Of course, if all issues were like this, then there would be some blurring of the lines between the Party and the government. In short, whichever form is more conducive to advancing work, mobilizing the people, and more conducive to socialist construction is good, and there is no reason to oppose it.
    Xi Zhongxun said that this symposium is only the beginning of the "blooming and contending." In the next detailed rectification process, we still need everyone to offer opinions at any time to help us. He suggested that all the issues raised at this symposium be submitted to the Counselors' Office for sorting out, research, and suggestions for handling them. Those that should be handled by the State Council should be handled by the State Council, and those that should be handled by various departments should be handed over to the departments for handling. Those that can be resolved now should be resolved now, and if one thing can be resolved today, then resolve it today. Those that should be done but the conditions are not yet mature should be handled appropriately after research. Those that should not be done should not be done with an explanation of the reasons.
    Xi Zhongxun also expressed his acceptance of the suggestion to establish this symposium as a permanent system. He said that during the rectification period, this symposium can be tentatively held once a month.
    After Xi Zhongxun's speech, the State Council's counselors discussed how to study and sort out all the issues raised at this symposium.

　　习仲勋在国务院党外人士座谈会结束会上说
　　共产党不欢迎的是反社会主义言论
　　只要对社会主义有利的言论，那怕说得过分，我们也欢迎
    新华社19日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋邀请党外人士举行的整风座谈会在今天下午结束。
    这个座谈会从5月29日开始，到现在一共举行了十二次。在会上发言的有四十八人，还有六位党外人士作了书面发言。
    习仲勋在今天的会上对非党人士表示感谢。他说，我们这个座谈会开得很好，大家做到了知无不言，言无不尽。大家发言的内容涉及的方面很广，有党政关系问题，法制问题，行政体制问题，机构编制问题，国务院各部门的职权划分问题，肃反遗留问题，人事安排问题，文教卫生问题，思想作风问题等等。这些问题有一些是带原则性的，也有许多是具体的。大家就这些问题提出的意见有的是反映情况，有的是提出建议，更大量的是对国务院的工作提出了批评。这是很好的，是我们竭诚欢迎的。
    习仲勋说，座谈会上所揭发出来的缺点和错误不少，这也没有什么可奇怪的。共产党所以要整风，就是通过整风，把问题集中暴露出来，加以解决。对于工作中的缺点和错误，我们有勇气揭发它，而且欢迎别人揭发它，我们有信心去克服、改正，我们不会使那些提意见的朋友们失望，我们一定要用改正缺点和错误的实际行动来保证大家的信心。你们可以看看我们倒底做得怎样，做得不好，还可以批评。
    习仲勋说，在这个座谈会上，也有一些不正确的言论，甚至有些言论离开了社会主义的立场，走向反社会主义的方向，但是这对我们也是有益处的。同时对于这些暴露了错误思想的人也有益处。不论正确的意见也好，不正确的意见也好，对于帮助党进行整风都是有启发作用和教育作用的。
    他说，共产党所不欢迎的，就是反对社会主义的言论。除此之外，只要是对我们工作有利的、对于社会主义建设有利的言论，那怕说得过分一些，我们也是欢迎的。当然，我们也懂得，人人所说的话不可能都是那么恰如其分，不可能对于每件事都说得那么恰当。话说得过分一些，夸大一些，是正常的现象。我们不应该在这些枝节方面斤斤计较，否则就会因小失大，妨碍工作的改进。
    习仲勋说，我们这个座谈会最大的收获就是没有迷失方向。参加会议的人都很快地在这个大的方面明确起来。我们的态度是：反社会主义的言论必须驳斥，因为这些言论是有害于我们人民的最基本的利益的；对这些言论不仅党不能同意，人民不能同意，就是一般赞成社会主义的人们也不能同意；对于工作的批评和建议，我们必须诚恳接受，严肃对待，认真解决。
    他说，现在看来，鸣放之中要有争，鸣放之后也要有争，这是认识问题的必然过程。没有争辩，那就是承认对的也对，不对的也对。争辩不是一件坏事，经过争辩最后会争出个真理。在争论当中，我们的态度必须明确。我们首先要有大是非之争，只有明辨了大是非，才能明辨小是非。所谓大是非，就是立场问题，是走社会主义道路呢，还是走资本主义道路？没有这个立场，一切是非就不好辨，这样对整风只会有损害，不会有帮助。
    在谈到党政关系时，习仲勋说，重大的方针政策性的问题，党政发联合指示只有好处，没有坏处；如最近的夏收分配工作问题，党中央和国务院就发了联合指示。因为不仅要使全体人民知道，而且特别要共产党员认识与了解政策，贯彻执行政策。当然，一切问题都这样，那就是有些党政不分了。总之，只要哪种形式更有利于推进工作，动员人民，更有利于社会主义建设，就是好的，就没有理由反对。
    习仲勋说，这个座谈会仅仅是鸣放的开始，在下一步的细致的整风过程中，还需要大家随时提出意见，对我们进行帮助。他建议把这个座谈会上提出的全部问题交参事室进行整理、研究，提出处理意见。应该由国务院办理的，由国务院办理，应该由各部门办理的，交由各部门办理。现在能解决的，就现在解决，今天能解决一件就解决一件。能够很快解决的，研究后就争取很快解决。应该办而条件不成熟的，研究以后酌情办理。不应该办的，说明理由不办。
    习仲勋在会上还表示接受把这个座谈会作为制度固定下来的建议。他说，在整风期间，这个座谈会可以暂定一个月举行一次。
    在习仲勋发言后，国务院的参事们对如何研究、整理这个座谈会上提出的全部问题进行讨论。
