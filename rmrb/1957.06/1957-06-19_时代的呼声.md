　　The World Peace Council's Colombo meeting, after seven days of gatherings and discussions, completed the task entrusted to it by the peace-loving people of all countries. The three documents unanimously adopted by the meeting voiced the common voice of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, and this voice will surely reverberate throughout the world like spring thunder.
    Among the three documents of the meeting, two are about appealing for and demanding a halt to nuclear weapon tests and the realization of disarmament. The meeting discussed this issue as the primary and most pressing issue, and made a resolution demanding an immediate halt to nuclear weapon tests to promote disarmament. This is fully in line with the wishes of the people of the world. People of all countries have long seen that the policy of expanding atomic armaments is the most serious threat to world peace, and have further realized the harm of nuclear weapon tests to human health and the future due to the warnings issued by authoritative scientists from many countries. In particular, the arms race of expanding atomic armaments has been intensifying, nuclear weapon explosion tests are becoming more and more frequent, and countries that do not yet possess nuclear weapons are trying to master this weapon. This situation cannot but cause great anxiety to all good people. But the people of all countries have not fallen into passivity. They have widely taken action to demand an end to the atomic arms race and an immediate halt to nuclear weapon explosion tests. The resolution of the World Peace Council's Colombo meeting centrally expressed this aspiration of the people of all countries; it will push the movement for an immediate halt to nuclear weapon explosion tests and the realization of disarmament to a new climax.
    Three days before the World Peace Council made the above resolution, the Soviet government, which has always been concerned about peace and human welfare, put forward a new proposal to temporarily stop nuclear weapon explosions within two or three years. This proposal is so practical and feasible that even Western newspapers believe it will make the realization of stopping nuclear weapon explosions possible. Therefore, the Soviet proposal is the most powerful support and the greatest encouragement for this good wish of the people of the world.
    Whether the people of all countries' wish for an immediate halt to nuclear weapon explosions can be realized soon now depends entirely on the attitude of Western countries, especially the United States government. The United States government has been using various excuses to perfunctorily deal with the demands of the people of all countries in order to continue to intensify the policy of expanding atomic armaments. The United States stubbornly insists that the continuous nuclear weapon explosions will not harm human health. This nonsense has been exposed by authoritative scientists from various countries. The United States uses the excuse that stopping the test cannot be guaranteed without international supervision, and refuses to accept the proposition of stopping nuclear weapon explosions. Now, the specific methods for implementing international supervision stipulated in the new Soviet proposal also make this excuse untenable. What else does the United States have to say? If it wants to continue to shirk its responsibility, it will no longer be able to escape the severe condemnation of the people of the world.
    On the road to consolidating peace, the people of all countries have another major task, which is to eradicate all the evils of colonialism. The Colombo meeting pointed out in the resolution on easing tensions and related issues: "As long as the desire of the people of all countries for independence is still suppressed by force, true peace will not exist." In fact, colonialism has become a serious obstacle on the road to consolidating peace. At present, the old colonial forces are still trying their best to maintain their positions, such as the British's cruel suppression of Cyprus and other places, and the French's cruel suppression of Algeria. However, what is more dangerous to the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America than the old colonialism is the new colonialism of the United States. The new colonialism of the United States is replacing the old colonialism of Britain and France to suppress and exploit the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The United States uses "US aid" and warships to promote new colonialism around the world, seize military bases, create tensions in the Middle East and the Far East, and make the countries of Latin America also fall into turmoil. The people of Asia, Africa and Latin America resolutely oppose the oppression of new and old colonialism, and are carrying out heroic struggles to win and defend their national independence. The anti-colonialist struggle of 1.8 billion people in Asia, Africa and Latin America is a powerful force for consolidating and promoting lasting world peace.
    The principles of the Bandung Conference must be realized, old and new colonialist oppression must be stopped, and the wishes of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America to win and defend their national independence must be satisfied. The world can only enter an era of peace and free cooperation for all mankind after getting rid of all the evils of colonialism.
    The Colombo meeting also put forward the propositions of stopping the policy of establishing blocs and military treaties, holding great power conferences, restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and withdrawing foreign troops from Europe in order to establish a unified European collective security system. These propositions are necessary measures to promote the continued easing of the international situation and the establishment of solid and lasting peace. However, there are still obstacles on the road to realizing these propositions. This is the policy of strength and the Cold War policy of the United States. This policy has created hostility and division in the world, filled the world with suspicion and hatred, so that international tensions cannot be quickly and completely eliminated. This policy of the United States has become increasingly unpopular and increasingly difficult to maintain as before, which can be proved by the setbacks the United States has recently suffered in its military base policy and embargo policy. As long as peace-loving people continue to strengthen the struggle to ease the international situation, they can make great contributions to the realization of the above-mentioned propositions of the Colombo meeting.
    The Colombo meeting was the first meeting held by the World Peace Council in Asia. It represents the will of the vast peace-loving people of 69 countries and issued the call of our times. This is a major development of the world peace movement. The common strength of the peace-loving people of all countries will continue to advance following the call of the times issued by Colombo in order to win a solid and lasting world peace.

### 时代的呼声

　　时代的呼声
    世界和平理事会科伦坡会议经过七天的集会讨论，完成了各国爱好和平人民所付托的工作。会议所一致通过的三个文件，发出了全世界亿万爱好和平人民的共同的声音，这个声音必将像春雷一样响彻全世界。
    会议的三个文件中，有两个是关于呼吁和要求停止原子核武器试验和实现裁军的。会议把这个问题当作首要的和最迫切的问题加以讨论，并作出了要求立即停止原子核武器试验以促进裁军的决议，这是完全符合全世界人民的愿望的。各国人民早已看出扩张原子军备政策是世界和平的最严重的威胁，并且由于许多国家的权威科学家发出的警告，更进一步认识到核武器试验对人类健康和前途的危害。特别是扩张原子军备竞赛已日益加剧，核武器爆炸试验越来越为频繁，尚未拥有核武器的国家在力图掌握这种武器，这种情形不能不使所有善良的人们感到巨大的忧虑。但是各国的人民并没有陷于消极。他们广泛地行动起来要求结束原子军备竞赛和立即停止核武器爆炸试验。世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的决议，集中地表达了各国人民的这种心声；它将把要求立即停止核武器爆炸试验和实现裁军的运动推向一个新的高潮。
    在世界和平理事会作出上述决议的前三天，一贯关心和平和人类福利的苏联政府，又提出了一项在两三年内暂时停止核武器爆炸的新建议。这项建议如此切实可行，就连西方国家的报刊都认为将使停止核武器爆炸的实现成为可能。因此，苏联的这一建议，是对全世界人民的这个善良愿望的最有力的支持和最大的鼓舞。
    各国人民要求立即停止核武器爆炸的愿望能否早日实现，现在完全要看西方国家特别是美国政府的态度了。美国政府一直以各种借口搪塞各国人民的要求，以便继续加紧推行扩张原子军备政策。美国硬说不断进行的核武器爆炸不会危害人类的健康，这种无稽之谈已被各国权威的科学家所戳穿了；美国以没有国际监督就无法保证停止试验为借口，而不肯接受停止核武器爆炸的主张，现在苏联的新建议中规定的实行国际监督的具体办法，也使这个借口不能存在了。美国还有甚么话说呢？它如果还要继续推脱，就再也躲避不了全世界人民的严厉的谴责了。
    在巩固和平的道路上，各国人民还有一个重大的课题，就是要根除殖民主义的一切祸害。科伦坡会议在关于缓和紧张局势和有关问题的决议中指出：“只要各国人民要求独立的愿望还受到武力的压抑，真正的和平就不会存在。”实际上，殖民主义已经成为巩固和平道路上的严重障碍。目前旧殖民主义势力还在竭力想保住它们的阵地，如英国对塞浦路斯和其他地方，法国对阿尔及利亚所进行的残酷镇压。但是，对于亚非和拉丁美洲人民比旧殖民主义更危险的，是美国的新殖民主义。美国的新殖民主义正在取代英法的旧殖民主义，来镇压和剥削亚非和拉丁美洲人民。美国利用“美援”和军舰，在世界各处推销新殖民主义，侵占军事基地，造成了中东和远东地区的紧张局势，并使拉丁美洲各国亦陷入动荡不安之中。亚非和拉丁美洲人民坚决反对新旧殖民主义的压迫，并为争取和保卫自己的民族独立而进行着英勇的斗争。亚非和拉丁美洲十八亿人民的反殖民主义斗争，是巩固和促进世界持久和平的强大力量。
    万隆会议的原则必须实现，旧式的和新式的殖民主义压迫必须停止，亚非和拉丁美洲人民争取和保卫自己民族独立的愿望必须得到满足。世界只有摆脱殖民主义的一切祸害之后，才能进入全人类的和平和自由合作的时代。
    科伦坡会议还提出了停止建立集团和军事条约政策、举行大国会议、恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位、撤退欧洲的外国军队以便建立单一的欧洲集体安全体系的主张。这些主张都是促进国际局势继续走向缓和以及建立巩固和持久和平的必要措施。但是，在实现这些主张的道路上，还存在着障碍。这就是美国的实力政策和冷战政策。这种政策造成了世界的敌对和分裂，使世界充满了猜疑和仇恨，从而使国际紧张局势不能迅速完全消除。美国的这种政策已日益不得人心，日益难于照旧维持下去，这可以从美国最近在军事基地政策和禁运政策上所遭受到的打击得到证明。爱好和平的人民只要不断加强争取缓和国际局势的斗争，就能为实现科伦坡会议的上述主张作出巨大的贡献。
    科伦坡会议是世界和平理事会在亚洲举行的第一次会议，它代表六十九个国家广大爱好和平人民的意志，发出了我们这个时代的呼声。这是世界和平运动的一个重大的发展。各国爱好和平人民的共同力量，将遵循着科伦坡发出的时代的呼声而继续前进，以赢得一个巩固的、持久的世界和平。
