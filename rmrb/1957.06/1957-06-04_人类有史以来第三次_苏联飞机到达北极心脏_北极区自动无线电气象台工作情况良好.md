Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. Soviet weather stations have recently been receiving reports on air pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed from high latitudes in the Arctic. These reports are sent from the fourteen "DARMS" automatic wireless weather stations set up in this region by the Soviet Arctic Research Institute's expedition. These reports will help improve future meteorological research, especially navigation in the northern seas of the Soviet Union.

	In mid-May, a group of researchers from the Soviet Arctic Research Institute, divided into two aircraft, departed from Leningrad and flew to the center of the Arctic polar region, braving extremely difficult weather conditions. Due to heavy fog and strong headwinds, the aircraft had to risk flying at extremely low altitudes for a long stretch of the journey. It wasn't until they reached the airspace above the center of the polar region that the fog and cloud cover thinned out, and the aircraft finally landed safely on a thick ice floe. This is only the third time in human history that an aircraft has landed at the center of the polar region. They stayed on the ice for six hours, set up an automatic wireless weather station, and then safely flew back to Leningrad under conditions of poor visibility.

	In May 1937, the late Soviet polar scientist Schmidt made history by landing at the center of the Arctic polar region for the first time and establishing the first drifting ice scientific station. The second landing at the center of the Arctic polar region was by U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Benedict. In May 1952, he flew an aircraft into this region and stayed for three hours and ten minutes.

	It has been a full twenty years since the Soviet Union established its first drifting ice scientific station in the Arctic region. During this period, the Soviet scientists' exploration and research work in this region has gained worldwide renown. One drifting ice scientific station has been set up after another. By April of this year, seven drifting ice scientific stations had been established. Scientists have discovered many new phenomena. For example, they discovered and explored the underwater mountain range named Lomonosov in the Arctic Ocean, obtained the first reliable materials on the conditions of the lower stratosphere and its vibrations, and also obtained valuable materials on the conditions of the ionosphere and the vibrations of solar radiation.

    人类有史以来第三次
    苏联飞机到达北极心脏
    北极区自动无线电气象台工作情况良好
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联的气象台最近经常收到从北极高纬度地区发出的关于气压、温度、风向和风速的报告。这是苏联北极研究所的考察队在这个地区设置的十四座“达尔姆斯”式自动无线电气象站发出的。这些报告将有助于改善今后的气象研究工作，特别是苏联北部海洋的航运。
    5月中旬，苏联北极研究所一批考察人员分乘两架飞机从列宁格勒出发，冒着非常困难的气候条件飞往北极极区中心。由于浓雾和猛烈的逆风，在很长的一段路程内，飞机不得不冒险作超低空飞行。一直到他们到达极区中心上空的时候，雾和云层才稀薄起来，飞机终于在一块厚冰块上平安降落。这是有史以来人类乘飞机第三次在极区中心降落。他们共在冰上停留了六个小时，设置了一座自动无线电气象站，然后在能见度很差的条件下安全飞返列宁格勒。
    1937年5月，苏联已故的极地科学家施米兹破天荒第一次在北极极区中心降落，并且建立了历史上第一个浮冰科学站。第二次在北极极区中心降落的是美国空军中校本尼迪克特。他在1952年5月驾驶着一架飞机进入了这个地区，并且停留了三小时又十分钟。
    自从苏联在北极地区建立第一个浮冰科学站以来，已经有整整二十年了。在这一段时期中，苏联科学家在这个地区的考察研究工作已经获得了世界性的盛誉。浮冰科学站一个接着一个设立起来。到今年4月为止，已经设立了七个浮冰科学站。科学家发现了许多新的现象，例如，在北冰洋发现和考察了被命名为罗蒙诺索夫的海底山脉，第一次获得了有关同温层下层的情况和它的振动的确实材料，还获得了电离层情况和太阳辐射振动等可贵的材料。
