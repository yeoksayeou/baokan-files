    Zhejiang's "Victory" Rapeseed Bumper Harvest
    (Our Hangzhou dispatch) Zhejiang farmers are celebrating a bumper harvest of "Victory" rapeseed. This year, the province planted 2,631,200 mu of rapeseed. According to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, the total output is expected to reach over 1.6 million dan, an increase of 305,000 dan compared to 1956.
    Last winter, when rapeseed was sown throughout Zhejiang, the improved variety "Victory" rapeseed was widely promoted. This spring, there was a lot of rain, and the rapeseed grew very luxuriantly. Members of agricultural cooperatives in Dinghai County described the density of the rapeseed, saying: "You could put an egg on the rapeseed canopy."
    In mid-May, the rapeseed harvest began, and many areas achieved large-scale high yields. For example, in the Jinhua Special District, "Victory" rapeseed can yield an average of 200 jin per mu. In Hang County, 12,000 mu of "Victory" rapeseed has an average yield of more than 120 jin per mu.

    浙江各地去年冬天油菜播种时普遍推广了“胜利油菜”良种，今春多雨，油菜长得十分茂盛。定海县的农业社社员形容油菜的茂密说：“油菜蓬上可以搁鸡蛋”。
    5月中旬，油菜开始收获，许多地区获得大面积的丰产。如金华专区胜利油菜平均每亩可收二百斤，杭县一万二千亩田的胜利油菜，每亩平均产量一百二十多斤。
