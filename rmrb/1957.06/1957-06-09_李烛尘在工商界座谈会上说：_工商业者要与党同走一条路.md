Li Zhuchen said at a symposium with business and industrial circles:
    Business and industrial workers must walk the same path as the Party.
    The Chinese Communist Party has called on the entire Party to conduct another universal and in-depth rectification movement. I believe this is timely and necessary. It conforms to the wishes of the people of the whole country and is a powerful guarantee for the Party to lead the people of the whole country from victory to victory on all fronts. It is also a concrete manifestation of the Party's great strength, broad-mindedness, facing up to shortcomings, and correcting shortcomings.
    Capitalists can "speak out freely and air their views," and the working class can also "speak out freely and air their views." The Party has opened its doors to any opinions raised by any party, and all doubts and concerns are superfluous.
    Now, from the central to local levels, a vigorous upsurge of helping the Party in rectification and offering opinions to the Party has been set off. Everyone spoke very well at the national symposium of business and industrial circles. There are many problems in our business and industrial circles, and we are also a force that cannot be ignored and is worthy of reliance in the Party's efforts to carry out the rectification movement well. According to the materials received by the China Democratic National Construction Association from various places, some business and industrial workers have concerns about "speaking out freely and airing their views." Their concerns are not without reason, and many people are still watching the wind in Beijing before acting. A material from Changsha reflects: a member regretted it after exposing the contradictions between public and private sectors; a member mistakenly believed: "The situation of speaking out freely and airing views in Beijing has now entered the stage of analysis and collection, and the workers in Shanghai have also spoken. I also feel that I dare not speak out loudly." These views and statements should not exist. We must fully trust the Party, because the Party has opened its doors to accepting any opinions raised by any party. We must recognize that, just like matching couplets, "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" is the first line, and "contending of a hundred schools of thought" is the second line. Our capitalists can "speak out freely and air their views," and the working class can of course also "speak out freely and air their views." We can have this kind of opinion, and others can of course have that kind of opinion. We can be completely open, and others can make appropriate analysis. Everyone "speaks out" and "airs their views" together. All doubts and concerns are superfluous. Business and industrial workers across the country must eliminate any ideological obstacles, say out loud what millions of eyes have seen and what millions of hearts have thought, so that the Party can hear our voices, and be realistic and targeted, instead of being emotional. This is precisely to show our infinite loyalty to the Party and the cause of socialism.
    Public representatives should unite, help, trust, and support private personnel; private personnel should not relax their self-transformation.
    Many people in our business and industrial circles still have a strong sense of inferiority and are not enthusiastic enough about doing a good job in the production and operation of enterprises. They also do not perform very well in the relationship between public and private cooperation. What is the reason for this? There are many subjective factors, such as a sense of class decline and a lack of political responsibility; a sense of grievance over the excessive or severe handling of the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movements, etc. These need to be overcome through strengthening political and ideological education. The more important objective factors are that many Party comrades do not pay enough attention to how to overcome the inferiority complex of business and industrial workers and encourage them to give play to their enthusiasm. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the public representatives and workers in enterprises do not unite, help, trust, and support the private personnel enough. Since liberation, business and industrial figures have made great progress under the Party's cultivation and education, and they have also shown many positive performances. The contradictions between the Chinese working class and the national bourgeoisie have been basically resolved with the advent of the high tide of joint state-private ownership throughout the industry. This is the result of the development and changes of the objective situation. The conscious, voluntary, and active efforts of business and industrial figures should not be ignored in this process. Their beating gongs and drums, and happily welcoming the joint state-private ownership throughout the industry and entering socialist society is clear evidence of this. This is even recognized by the government. However, the public representatives of joint ventures and many Party members still only know how to emphasize class relations, and have not noticed that the situation has undergone new developments. The class struggle between the two classes is no longer the main contradiction in our country, and is no longer an antagonistic contradiction. Today, class relations are very different from the past. Still using the ways and methods of dealing with old class relations to deal with the problems existing in the relationship between public and private cooperation, underestimating or ignoring the positive side of business and industrial workers, emphasizing their negative side, and doing very little in encouraging, praising, supporting, and promoting them to fully play their enthusiasm and contribute their talents. On the contrary, they despise them and discriminate against them. How can this not increase their sense of inferiority and dampen their enthusiasm? Of course, our business and industrial workers should not only see their own positive side, but ignore the negative side that is inevitably produced by the existence of class, blur the class relationship, the relationship between leadership and being led, and relax their own transformation. The inferiority complex of business and industrial workers should be overcome, and their enthusiasm should be brought into play. It was originally something that could be guided according to the situation, but because Party members failed to keep up with the situation in time and pay close attention, the situation that should have changed has not changed much, and many business and industrial workers feel that they have a position but no power, and have no place to use their strength, and a surge of enthusiasm has cooled down. How regrettable this is! Some people say: Why hasn't the enthusiasm of business and industrial circles been improved? Why did the total output value of these newly converted joint state-private industrial enterprises increase by more than 30% compared with the previous year in 1956? Precisely because of this, if the private personnel of all industrial enterprises can be active, its results will definitely be greatly improved. Party members should check more whether there is bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism growing in their work that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality; check more whether they themselves, as leaders and educators, have received sufficient education, and whether the Party has given sufficient education, especially the education of the united front policy, and obtain kind and effective help from all aspects, including private personnel in joint ventures. It is of great benefit to correctly treat and handle this internal contradiction among the people. The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have the responsibility to assist the Party and the state in doing a good job in resolving the contradictions that occur in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. We also need to check carefully to what extent the harm of the three isms has reached in our organizational work and publicity and education work, and improve the quality of our work in time, and correct the errors and shortcomings in our work. In the future, our work should not just be sitting in Beijing and issuing instructions, but we must go down to understand the situation and reflect the situation, and improve it immediately. This is very necessary.
    Business and industrial workers must walk the same path as the Party, and that path is socialism.
    Through "speaking out freely and airing their views," the concerns of business and industrial workers across the country are revealed. I believe and hope that the Party will attach importance to the opinions we put forward, correct the shortcomings that existed in the past work, and the objective factors will promote the rise and fall of the subjective factors; the objective factors that hinder business and industrial workers from overcoming their inferiority complex and giving play to their enthusiasm will gradually be eliminated, and the subjective factors will also gradually disappear with the gradual strengthening of ideological and political education. The things that were originally cooled down will re-emerge with enthusiasm in the business and industrial workers, and the situation of not having much energy will never return. This is beneficial to their transformation and the construction of the country.
    The Party's call for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is closely linked to the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." As democratic parties and people's organizations, to have the conditions for long-term coexistence with the Party and implement mutual supervision, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce must educate business and industrial members to share the same heart and walk the same path as the Party. This heart and this path are socialism, which is "what the people want and what the trend of the times dictates." If everyone has different ideas and goes their own way, then it is impossible to coexist. At the same time, we must "contend" in order to reflect the reasonable opinions and demands of the business and industrial masses, represent their legitimate interests, correctly handle the contradictions among the people, and play a role in encouraging and promoting them to further accept socialist transformation, so that they can eliminate ideological obstacles and actively participate in the socialist competition centered on increasing production and practicing economy, and fully contribute their technical talents. In this way, the business and industrial circles will join the glorious ranks of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in the great cause of national construction together with the people of the whole country.
    Finally, I earnestly and eagerly hope that the responsible comrades of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Eighth Office of the State Council will definitely be able to submit the results of the national symposium of business and industrial circles to the Party as reference materials for launching the rectification movement. All problems that can be solved in a timely manner and need to be solved urgently should be solved vigorously in a timely manner. Rectifying and correcting at the same time is the Party's rectification policy. The Party uses concrete actions to encourage business and industrial figures to speak out freely and air their views, and the concerns and doubts of business and industrial figures will be superfluous.

    李烛尘在工商界座谈会上说：
    工商业者要与党同走一条路
    中国共产党号召全党重新进行一次普遍的、深入的整风运动，我认为这是及时的、必要的，是符合全国人民的愿望的，是党领导全国人民在各个战线上从胜利走向胜利的有力保证，也正是党有伟大的力量，恢弘的气度，正视缺点，改正缺点的具体表现。
    资本家可以“鸣、放”，工人阶级也可以“鸣、放”，党对任何方面提出的任何意见，都是敞开着大门的，所有的怀疑和顾虑都是多余的。
    现在，从中央到地方，热火朝天地掀起了帮助党整风、对党提意见的浪潮，全国工商界座谈会上，大家也都谈得很好。我们工商界存在问题很多，也是党搞好整风运动的一股不容忽视的值得依靠的力量。从民建会收到的各地的材料看起来，有些工商业者对于“鸣、放”是有顾虑的，他们的顾虑不是没有原因的，还有不少人正在看北京的风向行事。长沙一份材料反映：一个会员揭露了公私矛盾以后，又表示后悔了；一个会员错误地认为：“北京鸣放情况现在进入分析和收的阶段，上海的工人也说话了，自己也有不敢大鸣之感。”这些看法和说法是不应该有的，充分地信任党，因为党对于接受任何方面提出的任何意见，都是敞开着大门的。必须认识，好比对对子，“齐放”是上联，“争鸣”是下联，我们资本家可以“鸣、放”，工人阶级当然也可以“鸣、放”，我们有这种意见，别人当然也可以有那种意见，我们可以彻底敞开，别人也可以适当分析，大家一起“鸣”、一起“放”，所有的怀疑顾虑都是多余的，全国工商业者要破除任何思想障碍，把几百万双眼睛所看到的东西，几百万颗心里所想到的东西，从嘴里说了出来，让党听到我们的声音，做到实事求是地有的放矢，而不是感情用事，这正是表示我们对党、对社会主义事业的无限忠诚。
    公方代表要团结、帮助、信任、支持私方人员；私方人员也不要放松自我改造。
    我们工商界中仍然有许多人到现在还怀有浓厚的自卑感，对搞好企业的生产经营的积极性还不够高，在公私共事关系中表现的也不很好，这是什么缘故呢？主观方面的因素很多，如阶级没落感、缺乏政治责任感；对“三反、五反”有斗争过火处理过严的委屈感等等；这些需要通过加强政治思想教育加以克服，客观方面存在的比较重要的因素，则是不少党内同志对于如何克服工商业者的自卑感和鼓励他们发挥积极性，注意不够，主要表现在企业的公方代表和职工群众对私方人员的团结、帮助、信任、支持不够。解放以来工商界人士在党的培养教育下取得了不少的进步，也有不少的积极表现，中国工人阶级与民族资产阶级之间的矛盾，通过全行业合营高潮的到来，基本上已经得到解决，这是客观形势发展变化的结果，在这当中工商界人士自觉自愿和主动的努力也是不应当忽视的，他们敲锣打鼓、欢天喜地迎接全行业合营，进入社会主义社会就是明证。这更是政府所公认的。而合营企业的公方代表和不少党内人士仍然只知道强调阶级关系，没有注意到形势已经有新的发展，两个阶级的阶级斗争，已经不是我们国家的主要矛盾，已经不是对抗性的矛盾，今天阶级关系已经大大不同于往日，仍然用处理旧的阶级关系的方式方法来应付公私共事关系上存在的问题，低估或者无视工商业者的积极的一面，强调他们的消极的一面，在鼓励、表扬、支持、推动他们充分发挥积极性，贡献才能方面做得非常不够，相反地轻视他们，歧视他们，这样做，怎能不加重他们的自卑感，不打击他们的积极性呢？当然，我们工商业者也不应当只看到自己的积极的一面，忽视由于阶级存在所必然产生的消极的一面，模糊阶级关系、领导和被领导的关系，放松自己的改造。工商业者的自卑感是应该可以克服的，积极性是应该可以发挥的，本来是可以因势利导的事，但是由于党内人士未能及时跟上形势，密切注意起来，使应该改观的情势改变不大，使不少工商业者感觉有职无权，有力无处使，一股热劲冷却下去，这是多么可惜啊！有人说：工商界的积极性未能提高，为什么1956年这些新转为公私合营的工业企业的总产值比上年增加了30％以上呢？正因为如此，假使所有的工业企业的私方人员都能积极起来，它的成果肯定说还要大大的提高。党内人士应多多检查一下在工作中是否有脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义在滋长；多多检查一下，作为一个领导人和教育别人的人，自己是否已经受到足够的教育，党是否已经给与足够的教育，特别是统一战线政策的教育，从各个方面包括合营企业私方人员在内取得好心的和切实有效的帮助，对于正确对待和处理这个人民内部矛盾，是有很大的好处的。中国民主建国会和工商业联合会有责任协助党和国家做好解决对资改造工作中发生的矛盾的工作，我们也需要很好地检查一下，在我们的组织工作和宣传教育工作中，三个主义的危害性到了怎样的程度，及时提高我们的工作质量，改正我们工作中的错误与缺点，我们今后工作不要只是坐在北京发指示，要下去了解情况反映情况，即时改善，这是非常必要的。
    工商业者要与党同走一条路，这条路就是社会主义。
    通过“鸣、放”，使全国工商业者的心事吐露出来，我相信也希望党一定会重视我们提出来的意见，把过去工作中存在的缺点纠正过来，客观因素推动着主观因素的消长；阻碍工商业者克服自卑感、发挥积极性的客观因素逐步消除了，主观因素也一定会随着思想政治教育的逐步加强，而逐步消失，原来冷却的东西在工商业者的身上重新冒起热气来，劲头不大的情况将会一去不复返，这对于他们的改造和国家的建设都是有益的。
    党号召“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，是与“长期共存、互相监督”的方针紧密联系起来的。作为民主党派和人民团体，要具备与党长期共存下去，实行相互监督的条件，民建会和工商联必须教育工商业者成员与党共一条心，同走一条路，这颗心、这条路就是“人心所向、大势所趋”的社会主义，假使各怀异心、各走各路，那就不可能共存了，同时我们要“争鸣”，为的是反映工商界大众的合理的意见要求，代表他们的合法利益，正确处理人民内部的矛盾，起着鼓励推动他们进一步接受社会主义改造的作用，让他们破除思想障碍，积极投入以增产节约为中心的社会主义竞赛，充分贡献技术才能，这样，工商界就和全国人民一道参加了祖国建设大业中“百花齐放”的光荣行列。
    最后，我热烈地、殷切地盼望中共中央统战部和国务院八办的负责同志们一定能够把全国工商界座谈会的成果，提交党作为展开整风运动的参考资料。凡是可以及时解决而且迫切需要解决的问题，就及时地大力予以解决，边整边改是党的整风方针，党以具体行动来鼓励工商界人士大鸣大放，工商界人士的若干顾虑和怀疑，将是多余的了。
