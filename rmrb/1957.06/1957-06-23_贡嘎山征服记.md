　　The members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Mountaineering Team waged a thrilling battle in their days of conquering Mount Gongga. On May 14, when the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Mountaineering Team arrived at the foot of Mount Gongga and set up a base camp at Gongga Monastery, 3,740 meters above sea level, the curtain on this battle was raised.

　　Spearhead on Mount Gongga

　　The first spearhead to scout the mountaineering route departed from the base camp on the morning of May 17. This reconnaissance group was composed of six experienced mountaineering athletes. They carried tents, mountaineering equipment, and food, each carrying nearly thirty kilograms. They crossed countless rapids and jagged rocks on the ancient glacier; they climbed steep and soft rocks, which would roll down at the slightest vibration. Three days later, they climbed to a rock top 5,100 meters above sea level. This place was surrounded by cliffs, a dead end. The scouts spent a night of heavy wind and snow on a rock with an area of only two square meters. Because they couldn't set up a tent, the snow covering their bodies soaked their clothes. This time, they failed to find a mountaineering route.

　　Three days later, Captain Shi Zhanchun personally led the second reconnaissance group up the mountain from a new route. The weather was hot that day, with clear skies and no clouds. They crossed avalanche gullies and traversed snow slopes of more than seventy degrees. When thirsty, they quenched their thirst with ice. Their faces peeled in one day. The next day, the journey was even more arduous. A bottomless ice crevasse, more than ten meters wide, blocked their way. On steep and hard ice slopes of more than eighty degrees, they used ice axes to carve steps, clinging to the ice slopes to crawl around the crevasse, and finally found a "snow bridge" formed by years of accumulated snow crossing the crevasse in a narrow place. Then they climbed over the "bridge" one by one. At this time, the snow was very soft, and the crampons on the队员's feet were covered with more than a foot of ice and snow, but they still resolutely passed through the icefall area covered with floating snow, hiding countless ice cellars and crevices, and more dangerous ice crevices, and finally climbed to the ridge 6,000 meters above sea level.

　　On the ridge, the scouts spent two days of blizzards. On the second snowy night, their tents were completely buried by snow. The eight scouts hurriedly escaped from the tents and snow. Some队员 only wore thin sweaters, and didn't have time to take out their gloves, shoes, and socks. In the severe cold of more than ten degrees below zero Celsius, they wanted to dig out the clothes buried by the snow, but the gaps that had just been dug open were immediately covered by new snow. The 队员 without clothes had to hide in nearby ice crevices. 队员 Liu Lianman and others used ice axes, snow shovels, and their hands to dig from morning until 6 p.m. before digging out the tents and clothes from under two meters of snow.

　　The wind and snow stopped. The scouts put on their clothes, and the sky was already full of stars. They carefully observed the road to the main peak in the moonlight, and then rushed down the mountain. This group of reconnaissance warriors, tempered by wind and snow, finally found the road to the main peak.

　　Fighting Snow Avalanches

　　While the scouts were looking for mountaineering routes, the mountaineering team also organized队员 for three preparatory marches.

　　On May 26, thirteen 队员 departed from the base camp for the first high-altitude acclimatization march. They planned to climb to a height of 5,400 meters above sea level. That night, they rushed to the second high-altitude camp at 4,700 meters above sea level and also encountered a blizzard with thunder and lightning. They were blocked by the wind and snow.

　　On May 28, the first day after the blizzard stopped, this thirteen-member mountaineering team set off again from the second high-altitude camp, climbing through snow that was waist-deep. They had to cross an avalanche gully to move forward. Just as the队员 were walking down the avalanche gully, a medium-sized avalanche occurred. As Deputy Captain Xu Jing just shouted "Avalanche," a torrent of ice and snow, with a thunderous roar, poured down. The队员 had no time to dodge and were washed down two or three hundred meters by the ice and snow, all buried under one or two meters of ice and snow. Some were washed into ice crevices by the avalanche.

　　Xu Jing, Zhang Xiang, and several other experienced 队员 struggled out of the shallow snow first. Regardless of the danger of a second avalanche, they immediately used their hands to dig through the one or two meters of ice and snow to rescue the buried comrades. Some 队员, although slightly injured, were unwilling to rest. They finally dug out all the 队员 from the ice and snow and crevices and withdrew to the second high-altitude camp at 4,700 meters above sea level.

　　Marching Towards the Main Peak

　　Difficulties cannot scare the brave mountaineers. After detailed planning, on June 4, seventeen mountaineers, with the reconnaissance team members as the main force, began to march towards the main peak.

　　When they climbed up the ridge 6,000 meters above sea level along the reconnaissance route, some 队员 lost their footing and rolled down the ice slope, losing their high-altitude equipment, and some collapsed in the tent due to severe altitude sickness. Deputy Captain Xu Jing stayed behind to take care of the sick 队员. The task of attacking the main peak was undertaken by the main force team composed of six scouts. These six people were Captain Shi Zhanchun, 队员 Shi Xiu, Liu Lianman, Liu Dayi, Peng Zhongmu, and Guo Decun. They had all conquered Mount Muztagh Ata last year. They bid farewell to the other 队员 and continued to advance with ice axes, ice screws, and high-altitude equipment.

　　On the road to the main peak, there were hidden crevices filled with soft white snow, and almost every warrior attacking the main peak had fallen into a crevice. They also passed dangerous roads with snow cornices on one side and thousand-foot cliffs on the other, each step fraught with danger. Once, a snow cornice collapsed, and hundreds of tons of ice and snow thundered down, and 队员 Liu Lianman almost fell off the cliff with the ice and snow. When the six warriors climbed to the ice slope called "Camel's Back" at 6,250 meters above sea level, they found that there was an ice cliff of more than one hundred meters under their feet, so they had to slide down the ice cliff one by one. After 队员 Peng Zhongmu protected all the other 队员 down the ice cliff at the top of the mountain, he tied himself to a nylon rope, protected by the 队员 below the cliff, and used ice axes and crampons to jam the ice cliff before climbing down the dangerous cliff wall.

　　The队员 connected the only two nylon ropes, each eighty meters long, tied one end to the ice axe at the top of the cliff, grabbed the main rope with both hands, and climbed down step by step. It took the six 队员 a full three hours to slide down this ice cliff.

　　At 4:00 p.m. on June 10, the six 队员 attacking the main peak climbed to a height of 6,600 meters. At this time, clouds and fog were thick, and wind and snow were mixed. They had to use ice axes to laboriously flatten the ice and snow slightly on the embankment and set up tents to rest. The next day was still a heavy blizzard, and they continued to climb the snow ridge in the wind and snow with a high-altitude tent. Braving the wind and snow, they desperately used ice axes and crampons to cling to the ice and snow, climbing the snow ridge with a slope of nearly eighty degrees. After more than three hours, they only climbed one hundred meters higher. They could no longer move forward and had to set up a tent, with six people squeezing together to rest. The blizzard lasted for two days. At this time, everyone gathered all the food together, and there were only a few biscuits, a few candies, some peanuts, and ginseng. In order to survive the blizzard, they decided to manage the food in a planned way. Eating a piece of candy had to be approved by Captain Shi Zhanchun. This was the most critical moment; if the wind and snow did not stop, they would have to go down the mountain. On the night of the 12th, the队员 hardly slept all night.

　　Unforgettable Moment

　　At 1:00 a.m. on the 13th, the wind stopped, the fog cleared, and the stars filled the sky. In the bright moonlight, the road to the main peak was clearly visible. The队员 were so excited that they could no longer sleep. They got up and prepared to make a final advance to the main peak. Although they had often been half-starved for several days due to lack of food, they only ate some fruit candy and ginseng this day, put on down jackets and nylon storm jackets, took their ice axes, and immediately set off. It was only 3:00 a.m. To reduce the load, they only carried the national flag, altimeter, maximum and minimum thermometer, cosmic ray measuring device, camera, and an iron box.

　　Captain Shi Zhanchun and 队员 Liu Lianman took turns leading the way. The slope of this snow ridge was particularly steep, and the ice and snow were very hard. The tip of the ice axe could only be inserted one inch deep. The队员 were already having difficulty moving due to lack of oxygen, but they still had to carve steps in the hard ice and move forward by stepping on the steps. After advancing one or two steps, they were too tired to breathe. They marched for more than ten hours to climb a distance of eighty or ninety meters.

　　When they were only twenty or thirty meters away from the main peak, the队员 were exhausted. They moved towards the main peak one step at a time, unable to move a few steps in a minute.

　　At 1:30 p.m., the six 队员 attacking the main peak finally climbed to the top of Mount Gongga, 7,590 meters above sea level. They seemed to forget the fatigue of the past few days and the headache from altitude sickness. The队员 stood high on the top of Mount Gongga and cheered. They shouted: Victory! Mount Gongga has been conquered by us! At this time, Liu Lianman and Shi Xiu tied the national flag to the ice axe and waved it continuously in the cold wind at the top of the mountain. They hoped that the comrades in the base camp would see this red flag, and they hoped to report the victory to the people of the motherland through this red flag.

　　The six 队员 sat down on the uneven snow on the summit. They used a hammer to knock off a piece of rock as a specimen. At this time, the weather at the summit was extremely cold. Although they were wearing two pairs of woolen socks and two pairs of gloves, their hands and feet were still frozen numb. They signed their names on a piece of paper. Shi Zhanchun put the note into the iron box he brought and buried it in the snow at the summit. 队员 Liu Dayi immediately used a camera to capture this historically significant scene. This note recorded the moment they climbed to the summit and also wrote, "For the honor of the motherland's sports, and to lay the foundation for the motherland's mountaineering movement, we climbed this peak—Mount Gongga." This unforgettable moment will be recorded in the history of our country's mountaineering movement. (Attached picture)

　　贡嘎山征服记
　　新华社记者　周祖佑
    中华全国总工会爬山队的队员们，在征服贡嘎山的日子里，进行了一场惊心动魄的战斗。5月14日，当全总爬山队来到贡嘎山下，在拔海三千七百四十公尺的贡嘎寺建起大本营以后，这场战斗的序幕就揭开了。
    贡嘎山上的尖兵
    第一支侦察登山路线的尖兵，5月17日早晨从大本营出发。这个侦察组由六个有经验的爬山运动员组成。他们带着帐篷、爬山用具和食品等，每人负重将近三十公斤。他们越过古冰河上无数激流和巉岩；攀登上陡峭而松软的岩石，这种岩石只轻轻震动，就会纷纷滚坠下来。三天以后，他们才攀登到拔海五千一百公尺的一座岩顶。这里四周全是悬崖绝壁，是条绝路。侦察员在一块面积只有两平方公尺的岩石上，度过一个大风雪的夜晚。由于搭不起帐篷，盖满全身的积雪湿透了队员们的衣衫。这次，他们没能找到登山的路线。
    三天以后，队长史占春亲自率领着第二个侦察组，从新路线上山。这天气候炎热，晴空万里无云。他们穿过雪崩槽，横越七十度以上的雪坡。干渴时，用冰解渴。脸孔在一天中晒脱一层皮。第二天，路途更艰险。一条深不见底、宽十多公尺的冰裂缝，横阻在他们面前。他们在八十多度的陡峭坚硬冰坡上，用冰镐刨出台阶，贴紧冰坡爬行着横绕过裂缝，才在狭窄处找到一座由多年积雪形成的横越裂缝的“雪桥”。然后一个个从“桥”上爬过去。这时，积雪非常松软，队员们脚上绑的冰爪沾了一尺多厚的冰雪，但是他们仍然坚毅地经过了铺满浮雪、下面隐藏着无数冰窑和裂缝的冰瀑区，和更多更险的冰裂缝，终于登上了拔海六千公尺山脊。
    在山脊上，侦察员们度过了两个暴风雪的日子。第二个风雪夜，他们的帐篷全部被雪掩埋。八个侦察员匆匆从帐篷和积雪中逃出。有的队员只穿着薄毛衣，手套、鞋、袜也没来得及拿出。在摄氏零下十多度的严寒中，他们想挖出被雪掩埋的衣物，但是刚刚挖开的缝隙，却立刻又被新落的大雪盖上。没有衣衫的队员只好到附近的冰裂缝里躲避。队员刘连满等用冰镐、雪铲和双手，从早晨直挖到下午六点，才把帐篷、衣服从两公尺深的积雪下挖出来。
    风雪停了。侦察员们穿好衣服，天上已缀满星星。他们在月色下仔细观察了通往主峰的道路，随即赶下山来。这批饱经风雪的侦察勇士，终于找到了通往主峰的道路。
    同雪崩搏斗
    在侦察员们寻找登山道路时，爬山队还组织队员进行了三次预备性的行军。
    5月26日，十三名队员从大本营出发，进行第一次高山适应性锻炼的行军。他们计划攀登到拔海五千四百公尺的高度。这天夜晚，他们赶到拔海四千七百公尺的第二号高山营地，也遇到了暴风雪，雷电轰鸣。他们被风雪阻住了。
    5月28日，大风雪停止后的第一天，这支十三人的爬山队又从第二号高山营地出发，踏着深及腰际的积雪登山。他们必须穿越一条雪崩槽前进。正当队员们走下雪崩槽时，发生了一个中型的雪崩。副队长许竞刚叫出“雪崩”两个字，一股潮水似的冰雪，带着雷鸣似的轰响直泻下来。队员们来不及躲避，被冰雪冲下两、三百公尺远，全部被埋在一、二公尺深的冰雪下。有的被雪崩冲落到冰裂缝里。
    许竞、张祥等几个老队员首先从浅雪中挣扎出来。他们不顾可能发生第二次雪崩的危险，立刻用双手在一、二公尺厚的冰雪中挖掘，抢救被掩埋的同志。有的队员虽然受了轻伤，也不愿休息。他们终于把全部队员从冰雪和裂缝中挖掘出来，撤回拔海四千七百公尺的第二号高山营地。
    向主峰进军
    困难吓不倒勇敢的爬山队员们，经过详细的策划，6月4日，以侦察组成员作主力的十七个爬山队员开始向主峰进军。
    当他们沿着侦察路线攀登上拔海六千公尺的山脊时，有的队员失足滚下冰坡，遗失了高山装备，有的因严重的高山病倒卧在帐篷里。副队长许竞留下照顾有病队员。突击主峰任务，由六个侦察员组成的主力队担负起来。这六个人是队长史占春，队员师秀、刘连满、刘大义、彭忠穆和国德存。他们去年都曾经征服过慕士塔格峰。他们告别了其他队员，带着冰镐、冰锥和高山装备，继续前进。
    在通往主峰的道路上，满布着松软白雪的暗裂缝，几乎每个突击主峰的勇士都曾掉在裂缝里。他们还经过了一边是雪檐一边是千丈绝壁的险路，每迈一步都隐伏着危险。一次，雪檐崩塌，上百吨冰雪雷鸣似地下陷，队员刘连满险些和冰雪一齐摔下悬崖。当六位勇士爬到拔海六千二百五十公尺被称为“骆驼背”的冰坡上时，他们发现脚下是一百多公尺的冰崖，他们只好一个个从冰崖上滑下。队员彭忠穆在山顶保护其他队员全部滑下冰崖后，把自己身上系上尼龙绳，由在崖下的队员保护，用冰镐、冰爪卡住冰崖，才从危险的崖壁爬下来。
    队员们把仅有的两条共长八十公尺的尼龙绳接起来，一端系在崖顶的冰镐上，用双手抓住主绳，一步一步爬下去。六个队员滑下这座冰崖，整整用了三个小时。
    6月10日下午四时，突击主峰的六个队员攀登到拔海六千六百公尺高处。这时，云雾弥漫、风雪交加。他们只得用冰镐在堤坡上吃力地把冰雪略为铲平，支起帐篷休息。第二天仍然是大风雪，他们带上一个高山帐篷冒着风雪继续向雪脊上攀登。他们顶着风雪，拼命用冰镐、冰爪扒着冰雪，往坡度近八十度的雪脊上爬。过了三个多小时，才升高一百公尺。他们再也无力前进，只得支起帐篷，六个人挤在一起休息。暴风雪一直延续了两天。这时，大家把所有食品集中起来，也只有几块饼、几个糖，一些花生米和人参。为了熬过大风雪，他们决定有计划地管理食物。吃块糖也得经过队长史占春批准。这是最严重的时刻，风雪不停，他们就只得下山。12日夜晚，队员们几乎一宿没合眼。
    难忘的时刻
    13日清晨一时，风停雾散，星星满天，在皎洁的月光下，通往主峰的道路清晰可见。队员们兴奋得再不能安睡，起来，准备向主峰作最后一次进军。虽然他们因食物缺乏几天以来常是半饥半饱，但这天也只吃了点水果糖和人参，穿上鸭绒衣和尼龙冲锋衣，拿着冰镐，立即登程。这时还只是午夜三时。为了减轻负重，他们只带着国旗、高度计、最高最低温度计、宇宙线测定型，摄影机和一只铁盒。
    队长史占春和队员刘连满轮流在前面开路。这段雪脊的坡度特别陡，冰雪非常坚硬，冰镐尖只能插下一寸来深。队员们在氧气缺乏情况下，行动已很困难，但仍然得在坚冰上刨出台阶，踏着台阶前进。前进一两步，就累得喘不过气来。升高八九十公尺的路程，他们足足行军十个多小时。
    距离主峰只有二、三十公尺时，队员们已经精疲力竭。他们一步一停地向主峰挪移，一分钟动不了几步。
    十三时半，六位突击主峰的队员终于登上拔海七千五百九十公尺的贡嘎山顶。连日的疲累和高山反应的头痛似乎被他们忘却，队员们高站在贡嘎山顶欢呼起来，他们高呼：胜利了！贡嘎山被我们征服了！这时，刘连满和师秀把国旗系在冰镐上，在山顶的寒风中，不住挥舞。他们希望在大本营的同志们望见这面红旗，他们希望通过这面红旗向祖国人民报告胜利消息。
    六位队员在峰顶凹凸不平的雪地上坐下来。他们用镐锤敲下一块岩石作标本。这时顶峰天气奇冷，虽然穿戴着两双毛袜和两双手套，但他们的手脚还是被冻的麻木，他们在一张纸上签了自己的名字。史占春把纸条装入带来的铁盒，埋在顶峰的积雪里。队员刘大义立即用摄影机拍下了这个有历史意义的场面。这张纸条上记载着他们攀登顶峰的时刻，还写着“为了祖国体育运动的荣誉，为了奠定祖国爬山运动的基础，我们登上此峰——贡嘎山”。这个难忘的时刻，它将载入我国爬山运动的史册里。（附图片）
