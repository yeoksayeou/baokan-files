　　Where did workers get to go to university in the past?
　　Ge Peiqi's students denounce Ge Peiqi
    (Our newspaper reports) More than one hundred worker-background university students at the Renmin University of China held a forum yesterday afternoon (13th) to vehemently denounce Ge Peiqi's reactionary fallacies.

    Many of these students worked in factories opened by capitalists and Japanese, spending difficult and bitter years. Only after the victory of the revolution did they have the opportunity to become university students. Therefore, they were particularly excited when criticizing various anti-socialist fallacies. At the forum, many people trembled with anger while speaking, and several female students shed tears when talking about their experiences in old China.

    Zhao Wenxu, a fourth-year student in the mechanical engineering class of the Department of Industrial Economics, denounced Ge Peiqi. He said, "Ge Peiqi is my teacher, but what kind of teacher is this? He is a teacher who is anti-people, anti-Party, and anti-socialist." He said, "'The living standards of the people have declined' is simply nonsense. My father worked for more than thirty years, and I am a young worker with twelve years of work experience. Before liberation, I worked as a technician in a Kuomintang arsenal in Chongqing. At that time, prices rose several times a day, and the wages paid sometimes couldn't even buy a bar of soap or a towel. The place where we lived was smelly and dirty. When someone died, they were dragged out like a dog. Working sixteen hours a day wasn't enough to feed ourselves, let alone support the whole family. One worker was so hungry that he killed his entire family and then committed suicide. After liberation, we worked eight hours a day, and the factory even provided popsicles in the summer. The whole family had an income of more than 150 yuan per month, with money left over every month. I went to university, and my two younger brothers went to middle school. Ge Peiqi, has life declined or improved?" He used facts to refute Ge Peiqi's fallacy that "the Communist Party is a plainclothes police." He said that in the arsenal where he worked before liberation, there was a "guard inspection office" that specialized in monitoring the workers' actions. Once, after wages were paid, a worker ran to question the director of this office, "See if this little bit of wage is enough to buy anything?" As a result, the worker was arrested and later died in prison. Another worker was immediately arrested and electrocuted just because he said, "The factory is a mess." This worker was later disabled, wandered into the streets, and starved to death. Zhao Wenxu said angrily, "Ge Peiqi said that the Communist Party is a plainclothes police. Then he said so many reactionary words, why didn't the Communist Party arrest him?"

    Xiao Kejun, a fourth-year student in the mechanical engineering class of the Department of Industrial Economics, said that Ge Peiqi said that only a few Communist Party members' lives have improved. Doesn't he have eyes? Didn't he see that all the people sitting in his classroom are workers? In our class of thirty-three students, twenty-seven are from worker backgrounds. Isn't this an improvement in the people's lives? Where did workers get to go to university in the past?

    Chen Ren, a fourth-year student in the metallurgical engineering class of the Department of Industrial Economics, said, If it weren't for the Communist Party, how could I have gone to university? My grandfather sold his own daughter because of poverty. My father broke his leg hauling carts for the landlord. Our whole family was about to starve to death. After the Communist Party came, I went to work in a printing factory. The government even took care of my family when we had difficulties. How is the Communist Party not good to the people? Who does Ge Peiqi represent? When the Japanese devils were here, there was a famine, and four members of our family starved to death. After the Communist Party came, when there was a famine, the government sent food and clothing by plane. No one starved to death in our hometown.

    Zhu Hanmin, a fourth-year student in the mechanical engineering class of the Department of Industrial Economics, said, "I am from the Northeast. The Northeast produces soybeans and sorghum. But the common people couldn't even eat tofu or soybean oil when the Japanese ruled. Many families shared one quilt. On snowy days, children ran barefoot in the snow. Later, when the Kuomintang came, the situation was still the same. The common people ate wild vegetables all year round. My brother's stomach was so swollen from eating them that he almost died. After liberation, not only did everyone have food and clothing, but all the children in the village went to school." Zhu Hanmin rebuked Ge Peiqi's absurd argument that "the common people also welcomed the Japanese." He said that the common people did "welcome" the Japanese! But not with applause, but with knives and bombs! If a Japanese person went to the countryside alone, the common people would definitely kill him!

### 过去哪有工人上大学？  葛佩琦的学生痛斥葛佩琦

　　过去哪有工人上大学？
　　葛佩琦的学生痛斥葛佩琦
    本报讯　中国人民大学一百多工人出身的大学生在昨日（13日）下午举行座谈会，痛斥葛佩琦的反动谬论。
    这些学生中，许多人曾在资本家和日本人开设的工厂中作工，度过艰难辛酸的岁月，只是在革命胜利以后，才有机会当了大学生。因此，在批判各种反社会主义谬论的时候，他们显得特别激动。在座谈会上，好多人在发言的时候气得发抖，几位女同学谈到她们在旧中国的遭遇，难过得流下泪来。
    工业经济系机械班四年级学生赵文旭痛斥葛佩琦。他说：“葛佩琦是我的老师，这是什么样的老师？是反人民、反党、反社会主义的老师。”他说：“‘人民生活水平降低了’，简直是胡说八道。我父亲做过三十多年工，我是个有十二年工龄的青年工人，解放前，在国民党重庆一个兵工厂做技工。那时，物价一天涨几次，发下来的工资有时还买不到一块肥皂一条毛巾。住的地方又臭又脏，死了像一条狗似地拉出去就算了。每天工作十六小时还糊不住嘴，那里能养活全家？有一个工人饿得没办法，亲手杀死全家，自己也自杀了。解放后，每天工作八小时，夏天工厂还供给冰棍。全家每个月有一百五十余元的收入，月月有剩余钱，我上了大学，两个弟弟上了中学。请问葛佩琦，这是生活降低了还是提高了？”他用事实驳斥葛佩琦说的“共产党是便衣警察”的谬论。他说，解放前他在的那个兵工厂就有个“警卫检查处”，专门监视工人的行动。有一次发工资后，一个工人跑去质问这个处的处长：“你们看看这点工资够买什么？”结果这个工人被抓走了，后来死在监狱里。又一个工人只因为说了一句：“工厂真是一团糟”，马上被抓起来受电刑。这个工人后来被打成残废，流落到街头，饿死了。赵文旭讲到这里，激愤地说：“葛佩琦说共产党是便衣警察。那他说了这么些反动话，共产党怎么不抓他呢？”
    工业经济系四年级机械班萧克俊说，葛佩琦说只有少数共产党员的生活提高了。他难道没长眼睛，没看到坐在他课堂上的都是工人？我们班上三十三个学生，有二十七人是工人出身的。这不是人民生活提高是什么？过去哪有工人上大学的？
    工业经济系冶金班四年级学生陈靱说，要不是共产党来了，我那能上大学？我祖父因为生活困难卖掉了亲生女儿，我父亲给地主扛活赶大车轧断了腿，眼看就要饿死全家。共产党来了，我进了印刷厂当工人，家里生活困难政府还给照顾，共产党对人民怎么不好？葛佩琦是代表哪些人说话？日本鬼子在时闹灾荒，我们一家就饿死四口人，共产党来后闹灾荒，政府用飞机给送粮食送衣服，我们家乡就没饿死过一个人。
    工业经济系机械班四年级学生朱汉民说：“我是东北人。东北产大豆、高粱。可老百姓在日本统治时，成年也吃不到豆腐和豆油。好多人都是一大家子人一条被。下雪天，小孩子光着脚在雪地里跑。后来国民党来了，情况仍是一样糟，老百姓一年四季吃野菜。我的哥哥吃得肚子涨得老大老大，差点没死掉。解放后，不但人人有饭吃有衣穿，村子里的娃娃都上学了。”朱汉民斥责葛佩琦说的“老百姓也欢迎过日本人”的怪论。他说，老百姓是“欢迎”过日本人！但不是鼓掌欢迎，而是用刀子和炸弹“欢迎”！日本人如果一个人下乡，老百姓准把他杀了！
