Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: According to Taiwan newspapers, the so-called "U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2" has been officially established in Taipei. This institution is primarily focused on "researching infectious diseases in the Far East and the physiological state of animals and insects that spread germs."

The report states that this U.S. military institution researching infectious diseases and animals that spread germs possesses the most modern equipment and instruments. It is located in a four-story building of 43,000 cubic meters on Gongyuan Road, Taipei, and is quite large in scale. The institution is headed by U.S. military medical colonel Philip. By the end of this year, ten American "scientists" and twenty American naval "technicians" will be participating in the work.

The report says that the predecessor of this U.S. military institution was the "U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit" established in Guam before World War II, which specialized in "researching tropical infectious diseases in the Far East." Later, the U.S. Navy Department gave a "careful evaluation" of the research reports of the "Guam Medical Research Unit" and decided to continue establishing such a "research center," believing that "establishing it in Taiwan is most appropriate." The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique reached a so-called "agreement" in the autumn of 1955. After a long period of preparation, this "research center" was recently officially established.

    美军在台湾设立“研究”传染病和带菌动物的机构
    新华社1日讯　据台湾报纸消息，所谓“美国海军第二医学研究中心”已在台北正式成立，这个机构以“研究远东地区传染性病症和传播病菌的动物、昆虫的生理状态为主”。
    消息说，这个研究传染病和传播病菌动物的美军机构，拥有最现代化的设备和仪器，设在台北市公园路一座四万三千立方公尺的四层大楼，规模相当大。这个机构由美军军医上校菲立浦主持。到今年年底，将有十名美国“科学家”和二十名美国海军“技术人员”参加工作。
    消息说，这个美军机构的前身是第二次世界大战前设在关岛的“美国海军医学研究处”，它专门“研究远东的热带传染病症”。后来，美国海军部对“关岛医学研究处”的研究报告予以“仔细估价”，决定继续设立这样一个“研究中心”，并且认为“在台湾设立最为适当”。美国与蒋介石集团在1955年秋天达成所谓“协议”，经过长期筹备后，这个“研究中心”最近正式成立。
