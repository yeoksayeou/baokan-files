	Criticizing Anti-Socialist Remarks
	Peking Normal University Professors Hold Symposium
    (Our Dispatch) In order to help the Party in its rectification campaign, besides offering active criticism, it is also necessary to conduct correct counter-criticism against remarks that are unfavorable to socialism, unfavorable to the leadership of the Party, and unfavorable to the people's democratic dictatorship. This was the voice issued at a symposium of more than 20 professors convened by the Peking Normal University Party Committee on the afternoon of the 10th. President Chen Yuan first spoke at the meeting (full text on page 3).
    Teachers expressed many opinions on how to conduct active criticism and correct counter-criticism. Professor Tai Shuangqiu said that in the rectification movement, a gust of evil wind has appeared. Wherever the evil wind blows, some strange arguments are made, and the purpose is to undermine the cause of socialist construction. However, evil winds are always evil winds, and they cannot suppress righteousness. In the past few days, some people have been defending these strange arguments. For example, in the People's Daily on the 9th, Gu Zhizhong's speech stated that he disagreed with some people's criticism of Chu Anping, and believed that it was still a case of "the speaker being guilty." He expressed doubt about the People's Daily's beginning to criticize some people's erroneous views, believing that this would affect everyone's willingness to speak freely. Zhu Zhixian said that being able to only say bad things and not good things; only criticize and not counter-criticize; only negate and not offer realistic, reasonable criticism; only seeing one point and not two points—these are not the spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom, but of one family dominating. To deepen the rectification movement, this counter-current must be resisted. Ma Te said that whether each person's remarks conform to the socialist standpoint in helping the Party in its rectification is a serious test for us. Although our country's large-scale class struggle has passed, there are still some people with ulterior motives who are taking advantage of the Party's rectification to muddy the waters. Wang Zhen said that a small number of people are using the rectification to exploit loopholes and want to defeat our Party. We should be vigilant about erroneous remarks and be good at distinguishing them.
    The teachers also discussed the claims of professors governing the school and democratic school management. Wang Zhen said that although there are various different interpretations of so-called professors governing the school or democratic school management, the meaning is the same: that is, professors decide the teaching policy, plans, promotions of lecturers, and decide on personnel retention and the selection of the president. If this were the case, how could the Party play a leading role? There is no way to guarantee the implementation of the Party's policies. Regardless of whether it's professors governing the school or democratic school management, although the names are different, it's just old wine in new bottles, and its essence is to abolish or weaken the Party's leadership. Guo Yicen said that our school is a socialist cause, and the Party's leadership should be strengthened, not weakened. The main task of professors is teaching and conducting scientific research. If professors specifically manage teaching affairs, it will hinder the work of the professors. Professors governing the school is not in line with the requirements of the socialist construction cause. Ma Te said that the Party's leadership in universities cannot be shaken. Some people say that the Party is an amateur and that "experts should be in charge" and "schools should be run democratically," which is to abolish the Party's leadership. We cannot agree to this.
    Wang Kunren, Zhu Yongqing, and Gao Yu also spoke at the meeting.

### 抨击反社会主义言论  北京师范大学教授举行座谈

　　抨击反社会主义言论
　　北京师范大学教授举行座谈
    本报讯  为了帮助党进行整风，除了提出积极的批评以外，对于不利于社会主义，不利于党的领导和人民民主专政的言论，也要进行正确的反批评。这是中共北京师范大学党委于10日下午召开的二十多位教授座谈会上发出的声音。陈垣校长首先在会上讲了话（全文见第三版）。
    对于如何进行积极的批评和正确的反批评问题，教师们发表了许多意见。邰爽秋教授说，整风运动中，出现了一股歪风，歪风吹到的地方，发出了一些怪论，目的都是要破坏社会主义建设事业。但是，歪风总是歪风，它是压不倒正气的。这几天，还有人给这些怪论在进行辩护，如9日人民日报刊登顾执中的发言，他不同意一些人对储安平的批评，认为现在还是“言者有罪”。他对人民日报开始批评一些人的错误观点表现怀疑，认为这样会影响大家畅所欲言。朱智贤说，只能说坏的，不能说好的；只能批评，不能反批评；只能否定，不能实事求是合情合理的批评；只能一点论，不能两点论，这些都不是百家争鸣的精神，而是一家独鸣。要使整风运动深入，必须反抗这种逆流。马特说，在帮助党整风中，每个人的言论是否符合社会主义的立场，是对我们严重的考验。我们国家大规模阶级斗争虽然已经过去了，但是，还有些别有用心的人趁党的整风的时候，混水摸鱼。王真说，少数人利用整风钻空子，想打垮我们的党。对错误的言论应有所警惕，善于辨别。
    教师们对于教授治校、民主办校的说法也进行了讨论。王真说，所谓教授治校或民主办校，虽然有各种不同的解释，但意思是一样的，这就是由教授决定教学方针、计划、讲师的升级，决定人员的去留和校长的人选，要这样，党怎样能起领导作用呢？根本谈不到保证党的方针政策的实施。不管教授治校也好，民主办校也好，名称虽然不同，只是换汤不换药，其实质是取消或者削弱党的领导。郭一岑说，我们的学校是社会主义的事业，党的领导应当加强，而不能削弱。教授的主要任务是教学，进行科学研究。教授如果具体管教务，反会妨碍教授的工作。教授治校是不符合社会主义建设事业的要求的。马特说，党在高等学校的领导是不能动摇的。有人说党是外行，要由“内行当家”，“民主办校”，这就是要取消党的领导。我们是不能同意的。
    会上，发言的还有汪堃仁、朱永庆、高羽。
