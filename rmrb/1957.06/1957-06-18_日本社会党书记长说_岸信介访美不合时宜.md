　　Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Says
　　Kishi Nobusuke's Visit to the United States is Ill-Timed
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma said at a press conference in Sapporo yesterday that Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States is ill-timed. The result of the visit will force Japan to strengthen its military, which is a heavy burden for Japan.
    At the press conference, Asanuma reiterated the Socialist Party's demands to Kishi Nobusuke: implement an independent foreign policy; revise the unequal Japan-U.S. treaty; and promote the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests.
    Asanuma also stated that the Socialist Party is prepared to take various measures to deal with the actions the Japanese government may take after Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States, such as dissolving the Diet and holding early general elections. He said that the Socialist Party has requested the government to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet, but the government is likely to postpone the meeting date and suddenly announce the dissolution of the Diet this fall when people are unprepared. The Socialist Party is preparing to request the government to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet before this to investigate the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's responsibility in foreign policy, economic policy, and labor policy, and to submit a motion of no confidence. If the government dissolves the Diet and announces early general elections, the Socialist Party will nominate 300 candidates to confront the conservative parties.

　　日本社会党书记长说
　　岸信介访美不合时宜
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎昨天在札幌市举行的记者招待会上说，岸信介访问美国是不合时宜的。访美的结果将会使日本被迫加强军备，这对日本说来是一个沉重负担。
    浅沼在招待会上重申社会党对岸信介提出的要求：实行自主外交；修改日美不平等条约；促使禁止试验原子弹和氢弹。
    浅沼并且表示社会党准备采取各种措施，来应付日本政府在岸信介访美以后可能采取的解散国会和提前举行的大选的行动。他说，社会党已经要求政府召开国会临时会议，但是，政府很可能推迟开会日期，并且在今年秋天乘人不备突然宣布解散国会。社会党准备在这以前要求政府召开国会临时会议，追究岸信介内阁在外交、经济和劳工政策方面的责任，并且提出不信任案。如果政府解散国会并且宣布提前举行大选，社会党要推选三百个候选人，同保守政党对抗。
