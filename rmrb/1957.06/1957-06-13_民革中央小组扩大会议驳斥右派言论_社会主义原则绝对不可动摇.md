The KMT Revolutionary Committee Central Group Enlarged Meeting Refutes Rightist Statements
Socialist Principles Absolutely Unshakable

　　This newspaper reports that the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held an enlarged meeting on the morning of the 12th. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Li Jishen. More than 40 people attended the meeting. Xiong Kewu, Liu Wenhui, Zhang Youjiang, Chen Mingde, Cheng Qian, Chen Qiyuan, Li Shizhang, and Li Junlong spoke at the meeting.

　　Xiong Kewu said: Without the leadership of the Party in the past, there would be no New China today; without the leadership of the Party in the future, there will be no socialist motherland in the future.

　　In his speech, Xiong Kewu said that recently, some of the criticisms and opinions raised about the Party have been biased, and even fallen into evil ways, which must be corrected immediately, otherwise it will cause bad consequences. He said, some people only allow themselves to "bloom" and not others to "bloom," what kind of "blooming" is this? Only allow themselves to "contend" and not others to "contend," what kind of "contending" is this? As for only allowing to say bad things, not good things; only allowing to talk about the negative, not the positive, that is even more unfair. We should be realistic and not completely obliterate everything. Especially unacceptable is to assume that the entire Party is composed of bad people and bad deeds based on individual bad people and bad deeds. This is a case of "a miss is as good as a mile." If this way of looking at problems is due to one-sidedness in thinking methods, it must be corrected; if it is malicious slander and distortion, we must conduct serious counter-criticism, otherwise there will be no right or wrong, no position.

　　Xiong Kewu said that some people want to abolish the leadership of the Party and negate the socialist road. This is not helping the Party to rectify its work style, but falling into a quagmire of serious errors. It must be recognized that accepting the leadership of the Party and following the socialist road conforms to the wishes and interests of the 600 million Chinese people, is the inevitable process of social development in China, and is absolutely unshakable. Without the leadership of the Party in the past, there would be no New China today; without the leadership of the Party in the future, there will be no socialist motherland in the future. If we do not take the socialist road, we can only return to the tragic dead end of old China, which the people of the whole country will never agree to.

　　Zhang Youjiang said in his speech that Chu Anping's statement of "the Party's world" is a reactionary idea, because it is against the socialist road. He said, the meaning of "the Party's world" has four points: First, slandering the Communist Party for monopolizing and taking over the government; second, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's government; third, "the Party's world" also means opposing the leadership of the Party; fourth, opposing the socialist road. Zhang Youjiang refuted these four points one by one.

　　Chen Mingde said: Counter-criticism should also be carried out in an atmosphere of gentle breeze and drizzle.

　　In his speech, Chen Mingde first condemned the "intimidation letter." He said that from the wording of the first intimidation letter received by Lu Yuwen and the despicable means adopted by the writer, it can be affirmed that the writer is afraid that this rectification movement will make the people more closely united around the Party. He believes that this kind of person is likely to be a counter-revolutionary. He said that it is very necessary for the People's Daily to remind the people of the whole country in its editorial not to forget that class struggle is still going on in our country. Then he talked about some remarks that have appeared in the "blooming and contending" that deviate from socialism. No matter how serious their mistakes are, they are still spoken publicly on the table. These remarks should be treated differently from destructive activities such as writing intimidation letters. He said that some of these remarks maliciously distort the facts and contain hostility towards the Party, and should be refuted seriously. Others have vague positions and consciously or unconsciously reflect bourgeois viewpoints, and they should be helped to raise their awareness and recognize their mistakes. He believes that although the ideas reflected in these remarks are anti-socialist, they should still be regarded as errors within the scope of contradictions among the people, and the principle of unity-criticism-unity should still be applied to them. Starting from the desire for unity, reason calmly and make it easy for those who make mistakes to accept criticism. Counter-criticism should also be carried out in an atmosphere of gentle breeze and drizzle. He believes that many of the articles and speeches published in the newspaper in recent days that specifically criticize erroneous remarks are in line with this spirit. However, some people, when conducting counter-criticism, deviate from the specific conditions when some people originally put forward their opinions, or further extend and exaggerate some original erroneous opinions, which may make it difficult for those who have expressed erroneous opinions to recognize their mistakes, and objectively increase people's concerns, which may have a negative impact on the continued development of "blooming and contending," which needs to be paid attention to.

　　Chen Qiyuan said: Without tens of thousands of "special materials," it would be impossible to achieve revolutionary victory.

　　In his speech, Chen Qiyuan said that he disagreed with some people who said that the saying "Communists are made of special materials" is the root of the idea of privilege. He said that Stalin's statement was not wrong. He cited some communists he had contacted and worked with during the First Revolutionary Civil War and the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and cited the communists who have played a leading role everywhere in factories, mines, organs, schools, and organizations in building socialism in recent years to show that communists are indeed made of special materials. He said: "Special materials" are the essence of our nation. In history, many patriotic heroes were also made of "special materials." They could live when they could live, and they could die when they could die. They sacrificed their lives for righteousness without hesitation. Communists have inherited our national traditions and carried them forward. He believes that without tens of thousands of "special materials," it would be impossible to achieve revolutionary victory, and it is difficult to imagine that socialist happiness would fall from the sky.

　　Chen Qiyuan also refuted the absurd remarks that "Party spirit sometimes gives rise to sectarianism"; "the Party's world" is the ultimate source of all sectarian phenomena; and the nonsense of those who promote "the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries were a mess."

　　Li Junlong said in his speech that the KMT Revolutionary Committee should help the Communist Party to rectify its work style, and that everyone should tell the truth, which is the main aspect and should be grasped. At the same time, incorrect remarks should be allowed to be counter-criticized, but when counter-criticizing, it is necessary to clarify the facts, distinguish right from wrong, and convince people with reason, and not use labels to suppress people. Otherwise, it will not help the criticized and will not help the rectification. He also said that the speeches at the previous meetings of the Central Committee of the KMT Revolutionary Committee were healthy and normal.

　　The full texts of the speeches by Liu Wenhui, Cheng Qian, and Li Shizhang will be published separately.

### 民革中央小组扩大会议驳斥右派言论  社会主义原则绝对不可动摇

　　民革中央小组扩大会议驳斥右派言论
　　社会主义原则绝对不可动摇
    本报讯  中国国民党革命委员会中央小组在12日上午继续举行扩大会议。会议由李济深主席主持。参加会议的有四十多人。在会上先后发言的有熊克武、刘文辉、章友江、陈铭德、程潜、陈其瑗、李世璋、李俊龙等人。
    熊克武说：过去没有党的领导，决不会有今天的新中国；今后没有党的领导，也决不会有将来的社会主义祖国。
    熊克武在发言中说，近来，对党提出的批评和意见，有的偏了，甚至堕入邪道，非马上纠正不可，否则会造成不良后果。他说，有些人只许自己“放”，不让别人“放”，这叫什么“齐放”？只许自己“鸣”，不让别人“鸣”，这叫什么“争鸣”？至于只许说坏的，不准说好的；只许讲反面，不准讲正面，那更是不公道的。我们应实事求是，不能一笔抹煞。尤其不可的是，把个别的坏人坏事，据断全党都是坏人坏事，这就是“差之毫厘，谬以千里”了，这样看问题，如果是由于思想方法的片面性，要改正；如果属于别有用心的诬蔑歪曲，我们就必须进行严肃地反批评，不然便没有是非，没有立场了。
    熊克武说，有些人要取消党的领导，要否定社会主义的道路，这不是帮助党整风，而是陷入了严重错误的泥坑。必须认清楚：接受党的领导，走社会主义的道路，这是符合六亿中国人民的愿望和利益的，是中国社会发展的必然进程，是绝对不可动摇的。过去没有党的领导，决不会有今日的新中国，今后没有党的领导，也决不会有将来的社会主义祖国。不走社会主义的道路，那只有回复到悲惨的旧中国的死路去，全国人民是决不答应的。
    章友江发言中谈到，储安平的“党天下”的说法，是反动思想，因为它是反对社会主义道路的。他说，“党天下”的含意有四。一、污蔑共产党垄断、包办了政府；二、反对人民民主专政和人民政府；三、“党天下”还意味着反对党的领导；四，反对社会主义道路。对于这四点，章友江一一进行了批驳。
    陈铭德说：反批评也应该在和风细雨的气氛中进行。
    陈铭德在发言中，首先对“恐吓信”加以痛斥。他说，从卢郁文所收到的第一封恐吓信的措辞以及写信人所采取的卑鄙手段，可以肯定写信人是害怕这次整风运动会使得人民更紧密地团结在党的周围。他认为这种人很可能是反革命分子。他说，人民日报在社论中提醒全国人民不要忘了在我国阶级斗争还在进行着，是十分必要的。随后他谈到，在“鸣放”中出现的一些离开社会主义的言论，不论其错误程度如何，究竟还是在桌面上公开讲出来的。对待这些言论，应该与写恐吓信这样的破坏活动分别看待。他说，在这些言论中有些是恶意地歪曲事实，对党含有敌意的，应该加以严正的驳斥。另外一些则是立场模糊，自觉或不自觉地反映了资产阶级观点的，应该帮助他们提高觉悟，认识错误。他认为这类言论反映的思想虽属反社会主义的，然而还应算作人民内部矛盾范畴之内的错误，对于他们还应适用团结——批评——团结的原则。从团结的愿望出发，平心静气地说理，使犯错误的人容易接受批评。反批评也应该在和风细雨的气氛中进行。他认为近几天来报上发表的对错误言论进行具体批评的文章和发言，很多都是符合这一精神的。然而还有一些在进行反批评时，脱离了有的人原来提出意见时的具体条件，或者把一些原属错误意见加以进一步引申、夸张，这样就可能使发表错误意见的人难于认识自己的错误，客观上会增加人们的顾虑，对“鸣放”的继续开展，可能起着消极的影响，这是需要注意的。
    陈其瑗说：如果没有成千成万的“特殊材料”，就不可能取得革命的胜利。
    陈其瑗发言中说，他不同意有人把“共产党员是由特殊材料制成的”这句话说成是产生特权思想的根源。他说，斯大林这句话并没有错。他举出在国内第一次革命战争时期他所接触过的和共同工作过的一些共产党员和抗美援朝的中国人民志愿军的英雄业迹，举出几年来在工厂、矿山、机关、学校、团体中为建设社会主义而处处起带头作用的共产党员，说明共产党员确实是特殊材料制成的。他说：“特殊材料”是我国民族的精华。在历史上许多爱国英雄也都是“特殊材料”制成的，他们可生即生，可死即死，舍生取义，毫无犹豫。共产党员继承了我们的民族传统，并且发扬了这种传统。他认为如果没有成千成万的“特殊材料”，就不可能取得革命的胜利，也很难设想社会主义的幸福会自天而降。
    陈其瑗还对那种认为“党性有时会派生为宗派主义”；“党天下”是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源的荒谬言论以及那些宣扬“三反、五反、肃反一团糟”的分子的谰言，也进行了驳斥。
    李俊龙在发言中谈到，民革帮助共产党整风，要使所有的人的心里话都讲出来，这是主要的一面，要掌握这一精神。同时，对不正确的言论，应该允许反批评，但在反批评的时候，要搞清事实，分清是非，以理服人，不要拿帽子压人。否则对被批评者没有帮助，对整风也没有帮助。他还谈到，民革中央小组历次会议上的发言，是健康的正常的。
    刘文辉、程潜、李世璋在会上发言全文另发。
