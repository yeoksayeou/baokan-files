　　My Understanding of the Party Rectification
　　Professor of Peking University, Li Jidong
    I read Mr. Liang Sicheng's "Experiences of a Month of Rectification" published in the People's Daily on June 8th, which resonated with me. Since the Party's rectification movement began, I have seen many opinions published by non-Party members in the newspapers over the past month. In our school, students, faculty, and staff have specifically exposed many underlying problems. In terms of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," it can be said that it has reached a certain climax. However, some of the speeches and behaviors are extremely unhealthy. For example, the speeches of Mr. Wang Dezhou and Mr. Ge Peiqi, lecturers at Renmin University, are typical examples, reflecting situations that do not conform to the facts, exaggerating, and spreading alarmist views; some speeches even go beyond the scope of freedom stipulated by the Constitution that 600 million people should jointly abide by. There are also people using threatening anonymous letters, and Professor Shu Zongqiao of Fudan University using crude methods to prevent others from speaking, which is an extremely bad style. We cannot but consider this a stain on this movement. In recent days, many workers, farmers, and many intellectuals have stood up to contend. I personally believe that this attitude of contention is worthy of our sympathy.

    We cannot forget a very important fact: since 1949, the Communist Party has led the country from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state to rapid progress towards socialism. The achievements of these eight years are obvious to all. Previously, our country's position in the international arena was despised everywhere, but in a short period of eight years, we have become a position in the international arena that is pleasing to our friends and feared by our enemies. Such an achievement is not simple. However, in the process of advancement, it is impossible to completely avoid making more or less mistakes. Therefore, everyone has some opinions and different views on the affairs they are familiar with. However, our views are not necessarily completely correct, because the cause is complex. We only see one side, not the whole, and it is very likely that the conclusion will be one-sided. For example, on the 7th, Mr. Zhong Buqiu reflected in the People's Daily the opinions of democratic German experts on the separate governance of the Ministry of Forestry Industry and the Department of Forestry, believing that this is the main reason for the waste of forest utilization. I used to have the same view. However, recently I participated in two symposiums of the Ministry of Forestry Industry, and from the speeches of all the attendees (not cadres of the Ministry of Forestry Industry and the Department of Forestry), I gained an inspiration and had a deeper understanding of this issue, realizing that my previous view was very one-sided. The main responsibility for the waste of forest utilization is not entirely with the Ministry of Forestry Industry, nor is it with the separate governance of the Department of Forestry and the Ministry of Forestry Industry. In fact, the main responsibility for the waste lies in the various individual timber-using departments and the imperfect aspects of the system. This example has given me a great education. Therefore, when we make suggestions, we should recognize the limitations of our own opinions and not subjectively think that our views are completely correct.

    From the perspective of the personal style of party members, the party has made great progress in recent years. The number of party members has increased to more than 10 million. Although every party member has undergone detailed tests before joining the party, it is an inevitable fact that a very small number of party members have some bad performances in their style. It is precisely because of this that the Party Central Committee wants to rectify the style, and in the process of rectification, it invites all parties to make extensive suggestions. I personally think this is a rare good thing in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad.

    I think everyone should now make suggestions to the party with the attitude of knowing everything and saying everything. However, when we make suggestions, we should try not to deviate from the facts and never talk irresponsibly. At the same time, we must also listen to other people's different opinions. In this regard, we, as people's teachers, should be more cautious, because our every move will affect young people. The words and deeds of Mr. Wang Dezhou and Mr. Ge Peiqi of Renmin University and Mr. Shu Zongqiao of Fudan University are a very regrettable event in my opinion.

    In short, we should make suggestions from the perspective of cherishing the party, hoping that the party can avoid mistakes and make fewer mistakes in the process of leading us to advance towards socialism, so that we can achieve our desired goals earlier in this just cause.

    In this regard, I would like to add that we should consider making suggestions to the party as everyone's regular task. We cannot regard making suggestions as a gust of wind movement. According to my personal experience, I used to have some opinions, no matter how big or small, I would raise them if there were problems, some involving school affairs, and some involving national undertakings, and I have never been rejected. Therefore, I have very few suggestions to make in this movement.

    Finally, I would like to state that, according to the views of the person who wrote the anonymous letter, I am a typical "伥" (accomplice) in his mind who works for the "tiger." I am sixty years old this year. What I have seen, heard, and suffered in the fifty years before liberation tells me that I can be such a "伥" for the "tiger" today. I not only do not feel "ashamed," but also feel very fortunate.

### 我对党整风的认识

　　我对党整风的认识
　　北京大学教授　李继侗
    我读了梁思成先生6月8日在人民日报上所发表的“整风一个月的体会”，引起我的共鸣。自从党整风运动开始后，这一个月中在报纸上看到党外人士发表了不少的意见。就是在我们学校中，学生、教职员工都具体地揭露了很多潜在的问题。在鸣和放上，可以说是达到一定的高潮。但是其中也有一小部分的言论和行为是极其不健康的。如人民大学讲师王德周、葛佩琦两先生的发言就是一个典型的例子，反映情况不符事实，夸大其词，危言耸听；甚至于有些言论是越出六亿人民所应当共同遵守的宪法所规定的自由范围以外。还有人用恐吓匿名信，也有如复旦大学副教授舒宗侨先生用粗暴手段阻止别人发言，这更是极端恶劣的作风。我们不能不认为这是这次运动中的污点。这几日来，有很多工人、农民同志以及许多知识分子起来争鸣。我个人认为这种争鸣的态度是值得我们同情的。
    我们不能忘记一个很重要的事实，共产党从1949年起领导全国从半封建半殖民地状态下向社会主义急进，这八年的成就是有目共睹的。以前我国在国际上的地位是处处受人鄙视，而在短短的八年中我们在国际上变为一种为亲者所快、仇者所忌的地位。这样的成就并不简单。可是在前进过程中，犯或多或少的错误是不可能完全避免的。因此每个人对于他所熟悉的事务上都有些意见，有各种不同的看法。但是我们的看法并不见得完全正确，因为事业是复杂的。我们只看到一面，看不到全面，很有可能结论就很片面。例如7日锺补求先生在人民日报上反映民主德国专家对于森林工业部和林业部分治的意见，认为这是造成森林利用上浪费的主要原因，我以前也有同样的看法。可是最近我参加了森林工业部的两次座谈会，从各位出席人（并不是森林工业部及林业部的干部）的发言中，我得到一种启发，对这个问题有了更深入的了解，认识到我前此的看法是很片面的。造成森林利用浪费的主要责任并不完全在森林工业部，也不在林业部和森林工业部分治。事实上造成浪费的主要责任是在各个个别用材部门以及制度上有不完善的地方。这个事例给与我很大的教育。因此我们提意见应当认识自己意见的局限性，不能主观地认为自己的看法是完全正确的。
    从党员个人作风而论，党在近年来有很大的发展，党员增加到一千万人以上，虽然每位党员入党都经过详细的考验，但极少部分的党员在作风上有一些不好的表现，也是不可避免的事实。正因如此，党中央才要整风，而在整风过程中请各方面广泛地提意见。我个人认为这是古今中外很少有的好事情。
    我认为现在大家应当以知无不言，言无不尽的态度向党提意见。但是我们提意见时应当尽量地不要脱离事实，切不可不负责任的信口开河。同时我们也要听取别人不同的意见。在这一点上我们身为人民教师的人更应当审慎，因为我们的一举一动都会影响青年。这次人民大学王德周、葛佩琦二先生和复旦大学舒宗侨先生的言行，我认为这是一件十分遗憾的事件。
    总之，我们提意见应当从爱护党的观点出发，希望党在领导我们向社会主义前进的工作过程中避免错误，少犯错误，使得我们在这种正义事业上能够提早达到我们所向往的目标。
    在这方面我还要补充一点，我们向党提意见应当认为是每个人的经常的任务。我们不能把提意见当作一阵风的运动来看。依我个人的经验，我过去有些意见，事无大小有问题就提，有的涉及学校事务的，大而涉及国家事业的，还没有一次碰过壁。因此在这次运动中我能提的意见就甚少。
    最后我还要声明一点，按照那位写匿名信的人的观点，我是一个他心目中的为“虎”作“伥”的一个典型的“伥”。我今年行年六十，在解放前五十余年中我所见所闻以及生受的一切告诉我，我今天能做这样一个“虎”的“伥”，我不但不以为“耻”，并且觉得是很值得庆幸的。
