Xinhua News Agency, London, June 15th: Soviet representative Zorin, at the resumed session of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee on June 14th, put forward a new proposal for an immediate, temporary cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    Zorin suggested that countries possessing nuclear weapons temporarily cease nuclear weapons explosions for at least two to three years.

    Since Western countries had previously opposed reaching an agreement under the pretext that a cessation of testing could not be guaranteed without international supervision, the Soviet Union, in its new proposal, stipulated the establishment of international supervision over the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. The Soviet representative suggested establishing several monitoring stations in the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and the Pacific. He also suggested establishing a supervisory committee under the United Nations to supervise the implementation of the agreement and report to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.

    The Soviet representative believed that, as a temporary measure, the duration of the nuclear weapon testing moratorium must be two to three years, because a shorter period would be meaningless. A pause of only a few months would simply become preparation time for the next explosion.

    The British Peace Committee published a letter from Zorin on June 14th. This committee had written to the five-nation representatives of the Disarmament Subcommittee, urging an agreement on disarmament and a cessation of all nuclear weapons testing. In his reply to the Peace Committee, Zorin wrote:

      "The Soviet delegation fully sympathizes with the anxiety felt by the British people and the people of all other countries around the world about the ongoing atomic and hydrogen bomb tests and the continued use of large amounts of funds for military purposes.

      "The Soviet delegation will make every effort to reach an agreement on disarmament, especially on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

      "However, due to the opposition of certain groups in the West, there are still some difficulties in reaching an agreement.

      "Therefore, governments and public organizations of all countries must make their best efforts to help remove obstacles to reaching a disarmament agreement."

    The British Peace Committee said it had not yet received replies from other representatives.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, June 15th, report by this agency's reporter Peng Di: The Soviet Union has put forward new proposals to Western countries at the disarmament conference that resumed on June 14th, but Western countries are continuing to adopt a delaying attitude towards the negotiations.

    French representative Moch immediately spoke after Zorin presented the new proposal to the Subcommittee, saying that France was unwilling to be bound by any agreement on the cessation of testing if countries possessing nuclear weapons reached such an agreement.

    Moch wanted to complicate the issue, saying that the Soviet Union should also agree to stop producing fissionable materials for military purposes. U.S. representative Stassen supported Moch's opinion.

    The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meetings have been repeatedly adjourned and postponed recently. This is entirely because U.S. representative Stassen wanted more time to consult with other Western countries and Washington. Adenauer is more afraid than anyone else of reaching a disarmament agreement before the West German elections. Some in Britain also advocate continuing to expand West Germany's armaments within certain limits so that it does not become a strong competitor to Britain in terms of economic and commercial power.

    The strong appeal of the Soviet Union's new proposals to the public worries Western countries. Under these difficult circumstances, both Stassen and British representative Noble emphasized once again at yesterday's meeting that greater caution and more informal consultations were needed.

    The meeting will continue on the 17th.

### 把各国人民愿望变成行动  苏联建议两三年内暂停核爆炸  主张在苏英美和太平洋设监督站

    把各国人民愿望变成行动
    苏联建议两三年内暂停核爆炸
    主张在苏英美和太平洋设监督站
    新华社伦敦15日电　苏联代表佐林在6月14日复会的联合国裁军小组委员会会议上提出了立即暂时停止核武器试验的新建议。
    佐林建议拥有核武器的国家至少在两三年里暂时停止核武器爆炸。
    由于西方国家曾经以没有国际监督就无法保证停止试验为借口，来反对达成协议，苏联在新建议里规定对暂时停止原子武器和氢武器试验建立国际监督。苏联代表建议在苏联、英国、美国和太平洋建立若干监督站。他还建议在联合国下面设立监督委员会，对协议的执行进行监督，并且向联合国大会和安全理事会提出报告。
    苏联代表认为：作为一种临时性措施，核武器试验暂停的期限必须是两年到三年，因为如果期限比这短，那就会毫无意义。如果只暂停几个月，那就只成了准备下次爆炸的准备时间。
    英国和平委员会在6月14日发表了佐林的一封来信，这个委员会曾经写信给裁军小组委员会的五国代表，敦促达成裁军协议和停止一切核武器试验的协议。佐林在对和平委员会的答复中写道：
      “苏联代表团完全同情英国人民和全世界其他各国人民对现在进行的原子弹氢弹试验以及对大量经费继续用于军事目的所感到的焦虑。
      “苏联代表团将尽一切努力，争取就裁军问题，特别是停止核武器试验问题达成协议。
      “但是，由于西方某些集团的反对，要达成协议还有一些困难。
      “因此，各国政府和公众团体都必须尽最大的努力来帮助排除妨害达成裁军协议的障碍。”
    英国和平委员会说，它现在还没有收到其他代表的答复。
    据新华社伦敦15日电　本社记者彭迪报道：苏联已经在6月14日复会的裁军会议上向西方国家提出新的建议，但是西方国家却在继续采取着拖延谈判的态度。
    法国代表莫克在佐林向小组委员会提出新建议以后立即发言说，拥有原子核武器的国家如果就停止试验问题达成任何协议，法国是不愿意受这种协议的约束的。
    莫克想使问题复杂化，他说，苏联也应该同意停止为了军事目的而生产裂变物质。美国代表史塔生支持莫克这个意见。
    联合国裁军小组委员会会议最近已经一再休会和延期。这完全是因为美国代表史塔生希望有更多的时间去同其他西方国家和华盛顿方面进行商谈。阿登纳则比谁都害怕在西德选举以前达成裁军协议。英国也有人主张使西德继续在一定限度以内扩张军备，以便使它不致于在经济和商业方面力量强大起来而成为英国的劲敌。
    苏联新建议对公众的强大吸引力使西方国家感到担心。在这种困难的处境之下，史塔生和英国代表诺布尔在昨天会议上都再一次强调地说，应该更加慎重和进行更多的非正式商谈。
    会议将在17日继续举行。
