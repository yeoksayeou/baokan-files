Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 21st: Taiyuan City has recently revised its urban construction plan, which had excessively high standards and occupied too much land, in accordance with the spirit of rectification and the principle of "starting from the near term and considering the long term."

The residential area standard has been reduced from an average of nine square meters per person to four to five square meters.  In accordance with the characteristic that most local residents are accustomed to living in single-story houses, the building density has been redefined, reducing the proportion of buildings of three stories or more, which previously accounted for 70% of all residential buildings, to 30%. In urban areas with good soil quality and high terrain, efforts will be made to take soil locally and build more affordable, sturdy, and practical single-story houses. In terms of building multi-story buildings, the city advocates the use of simple two-story buildings with shared water taps, public toilets, and stove heating. The investment in these types of buildings is 27% less than that of fully equipped three-story buildings, and they occupy less land, saving on outdoor pipelines. In addition, the Urban Construction Bureau has reformulated the policy of "filling in gaps and supplementing vacancies" in response to the overly scattered layout of existing buildings, and will continue to allocate temporarily unused land to farmers in the suburbs for cultivation.

　　纠正标准过高、占地过多的缺点
    太原市修改城市建设规划
    据新华社太原21日电　太原市最近按着整风精神和“从近期出发，照顾远期”的原则，修改了标准过高、占地过大的城市建设规划。
    居住面积标准，由每人平均九平方公尺压缩到四到五平方公尺。按照当地大部分居民习惯住平房的特点，重新确定了建筑密度，把过去占全部居住建筑70％的三层以上楼房建筑，减少到30％；在土质好、地势高的市区，尽量就地取土，多建筑一些价钱便宜而又坚固适用的平房；在修建楼房方面，提倡多采用公共水龙头用水、使用公共厕所及火炉取暖的简易二层楼房，这种楼房比设备齐全的三层楼的投资少用27％，而且占地少，能节省室外管线。此外，城市建筑管理局还根据现有建筑物太零散的情况，重新拟订出“填实补空”的方针，并且继续把暂时不用的土地交给郊区农民耕种。
