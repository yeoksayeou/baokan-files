　　Dispatching More Cadres, Allocating More Cultivated Land, Developing More Sideline Occupations
    Bulgaria Vigorously Consolidates Agricultural Cooperatives
    Cooperativization Movement Moves Towards Mountainous and Semi-Mountainous Areas
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 27th: Bulgaria is vigorously consolidating its existing agricultural production cooperatives, while steadily establishing new cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas.
    Bulgaria has a total of 3,126 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 80% of peasant households and cultivated land already participating in the cooperatives. The current focus of consolidation is on about 300 backward cooperatives. The main reasons for the backwardness of these cooperatives are weak leadership, less cultivated land with poor soil, and crops that were previously planted were not suitable for the local soil and climatic conditions. Now the Party and the government have taken measures to provide strong assistance. Up to now, with the consent of the members of these cooperatives, the Party and the government have dispatched about 2,000 experienced Party and non-Party cadres to serve as chairmen, accountants, production team leaders, and other positions; more than 210,000 decares (each decare equals 1.5 mu) of cultivated land have been allocated from state farms to cooperatives with less land; in addition, it has been decided to help these cooperatives solve problems such as transportation, fertilizer, etc., reduce some of their obligations to the state, and provide new loans or extend the repayment period of existing loans to economically disadvantaged cooperatives. In order to increase the income of these cooperatives, the Party and the government have also decided to transfer about 500 small handicraft production cooperatives belonging to local industries to these agricultural cooperatives for operation.
    In July last year and January this year, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Party Central Committee decided to reduce the amount of agricultural products purchased and increase the prices of purchased and contracted agricultural products. These measures are of great significance for consolidating cooperatives. According to estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, due to these measures, farmers across the country can increase their income by about 500 million leva per year. Expanding the cultivation area of intensively cultivated crops such as fruits and vegetables also plays a good role in increasing the income of cooperative members and consolidating cooperatives.
    Now Bulgaria's cooperativization movement is underway in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Up to now, about 15% of the peasant households and cultivated land in these areas have been cooperativized. The main task at present is to consolidate existing cooperatives, continuously increase the income of members, and steadily establish new cooperatives where conditions permit. The government has also stipulated some preferential conditions for newly established cooperatives in these areas.

　　加派干部  增拨耕地  多搞副业
    保加利亚大力巩固农业社
    合作化运动走向山区和半山区
    新华社索非亚27日电  保加利亚正在大力巩固现有的农业生产合作社，同时在山区和半山区稳步地建立新的合作社。
    保加利亚全国共有三千一百二十六个农业生产合作社，入社农户和耕地都已经达到80％以上。目前巩固的重点是约三百个左右落后的合作社。这些合作社落后的主要原因是领导薄弱，耕地少而且土壤贫瘠，过去种植的作物不适合于当地的土壤、气候条件等。现在党和政府已经采取措施，大力给予帮助。到目前为止，党和政府已经在这些合作社社员的同意下，派了约两千名有经验的党和非党干部去担任主席、会计、生产队长等职务；从国营农场拨出了二十一万多狄卡尔（每狄卡尔等于一·五市亩）耕地给予地少的社；另外还决定帮助这些社解决运输工具、肥料等问题，减免它们对国家的一些义务，对经济上困难的社给予新的贷款或者延长原有贷款的归还期限。为了增加这些社的收入，党和政府还决定把约五百多个属于地方工业的小型手工业生产合作社转归这些农业合作社经营。
    去年7月和今年1月，保加利亚部长会议和党中央曾经决定减少农产品征购量，提高征购和按照合同收购农产品的价格。这些措施对巩固合作社有很大意义。据农业部方面的估计，由于采取这些措施，全国农民每年可以增加约五亿列弗收入。扩大水果、蔬菜等精耕作物的栽培面积，对于增加合作社社员收入和巩固合作社也起着良好的作用。
    现在保加利亚的合作化运动正在山区和半山区进行。到目前为止，这些地区的农户和耕地约有15％已经合作化了。目前的主要任务是巩固已有的合作社，不断增加社员收入，在有条件的地方稳步地建立新合作社。政府还规定了一些给予这些地区新建的合作社的优惠条件。
