Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: The fourth enlarged meeting of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, lasting three days, concluded today.

　　Commission Chairman Nie Rongzhen gave a concluding speech.

　　Nie Rongzhen said that everyone agreed on the four main issues we raised for discussion at this meeting: the national science work system; the 1957 national science and technology research plan; the four science research work condition plans for books, materials, instruments, and chemical reagents; and some opinions on the coordinated arrangement of philosophy and social sciences. After this meeting, due to the initial resolution of the above issues, our scientific work can gradually move forward under new and favorable conditions.

　　Nie Rongzhen said that everyone raised many opinions in group discussions and plenary speeches. The vast majority of these opinions are correct, and all those directly related to the reports, plans, and programs of this meeting have been incorporated into the meeting's various documents. The documents have been revised and supplemented based on these opinions. Some opinions will be noted in future work or referred to relevant departments. There are also individual opinions that differ from everyone else's and require further study. According to the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," they can be temporarily retained and allowed to exist. However, this meeting must make decisions based on the opinions of the vast majority in order to take action. Some long-standing disputes with relatively mature opinions, which are work-related rather than academic issues, would continue to cause ideological confusion in our scientific team if they were endlessly debated, which is detrimental to the development of science. If better methods are discovered in practice, we can adopt new methods again.

　　Nie Rongzhen said that the Science Planning Commission plans to solve the following main problems in the second half of this year: A, improve the various professional groups and establish working groups to improve the conditions for scientific work, so that these plans can be implemented quickly. B, formulate a plan for scientific funding (including scientific foundations), make necessary adjustments to the few senior scientists who are indeed using funds improperly, and propose some plans for senior scientists' assistants and graduate students. C, formulate the 1958 research plan and revise the second five-year science work plan.

　　Regarding further arrangements for philosophy and social sciences, the philosophy and social science members of the Science Planning Commission will hold a special meeting to discuss this, and the commission will organize a special office to handle the work in the field of philosophy and social sciences.

　　Huang Jing, Vice Chairman of the Science Planning Commission and Director of the State Technology Commission, criticized in his speech some people's claim that China's scientific research has been interrupted since liberation. He believes that China's science has not been interrupted but developed in the eight years since liberation; and it has created a foundation for future great development.

　　Pan Zinian, a member of the Science Planning Commission, spoke at the meeting today on the issue of science in the old society. He disagreed with some people's claims recently published in newspapers: "To develop social sciences, we must first change our attitude towards social sciences in the old society." Pan Zinian believes that bourgeois social sciences serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. It is absolutely necessary to reconsider bourgeois social sciences since liberation. There are some useful things in bourgeois social sciences, and we have always advocated inheriting cultural heritage. Marxism is the summary of all human knowledge. However, it is the credit of Marx and Engels that the study of social history truly became a science. Before that, people did not grasp the fundamental laws of social history and did not understand the laws of class struggle. Therefore, those things called "social sciences" in the past were actually not scientific enough. He said that today we must first use the Marxist viewpoint and method to study current realities and history, critically analyze and study cultural heritage, and should not simply "restore" those bourgeois social sciences.

　　Yesterday, the meeting held group discussions, and today listened to speeches from a total of twenty-two members and local representatives.

　　科学将在新的条件下向前发展
　　科学规划委员会第四次扩大会议结束
    新华社15日讯　历时三天的国务院科学规划委员会第四次扩大会议今天结束。
    委员会主任聂荣臻作了总结发言。
    聂荣臻说，大家同意了我们在这次会议上提出讨论的四个主要问题：全国科学工作体制问题；1957年全国科学技术研究计划；图书、资料、仪器、化学试剂四个科学研究工作条件方案，以及哲学社会科学统筹安排的一些意见。在这次会议后，由于上述问题的开始解决，我们的科学工作又可以在新的有利条件下逐步向前发展了。
    聂荣臻说，在小组讨论和大会发言中，大家提了许多意见。这些意见，绝大部分都是正确的，凡与这次会议的报告、计划和方案直接有关的，都已吸收到会议各项文件中去。根据这些意见对文件作了修改和补充。有些意见，将在今后工作中注意，或交有关部门参考。也有个别意见，和大家意见不相同，还须进一步研究，根据“百家争鸣”精神，可以暂时保留，允许存在。但这次会议必须根据绝大多数人的意见，作出决定，以便行动。有些争论已久而有已经比较成熟的意见，又是工作上的而不是学术上的问题，如果继续永远无休止地争论下去，会使我们的科学队伍中继续保持思想上的混乱，这对科学事业的发展是不利的，如果在实践中发现了更好的办法，我们可再采取新的办法。
    聂荣臻说，科学规划委员会今年下半年打算解决下列几个主要问题：甲、健全各专业小组，并建立改善科学工作条件的工作小组，使这些方案迅速付诸实施。乙、制订科学经费（包括科学基金）的方案，并对确实使用不当的少数高级科学家进行必要的调整工作，对高级科学家的助手以及研究生等问题，也要提出一些方案。丙、制订1958年的研究计划，并修订第二个五年的科学工作计划。
    关于哲学社会科学方面的进一步安排，科学规划委员会哲学社会科学方面的委员将专门开会讨论，委员会并将组织专门的办公机构来处理哲学社会科学方面的工作。
    科学规划委员会副主任、国家技术委员会主任黄敬在发言中批判了有些人认为解放以来中国科学研究中断的说法。他认为解放以来八年中我国科学不是中断而是发展了；并且为今后的大发展创造了基础。
    科学规划委员会委员潘梓年今天在会议上就旧社会科学问题发言。他不同意近来报纸上发表的有些人的说法：“要发展社会科学，首先要改变对待旧社会科学的态度。”潘梓年认为，资产阶级社会科学是为资产阶级利益服务的。解放以来对资产阶级社会科学采取重新考虑的态度是完全必要的。资产阶级社会科学中是有一些有用的东西，我们向来主张继承文化遗产。马克思主义是人类一切知识的总结。但对于社会历史的研究，真正成为科学，是马克思、恩格斯的功劳。在这以前，人们没有掌握社会历史的根本规律，不懂得阶级斗争的规律，所以过去那些被称为“社会科学”的东西，实际上是不够科学的。他说，今天我们首先要用马克思主义的观点和方法来研究当前的实际和历史，对文化遗产要批判地加以分析研究，而不应该简单地去“恢复”那些资产阶级社会科学。
    昨天，会议进行小组讨论，今天听取了委员和地方代表共二十二人的发言。
