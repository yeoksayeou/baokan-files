　　Hitler Returns
　　West Berlin Appears in Costume Parade
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Berlin News: In the midst of West Germany's rearmament, the ghost of Hitler recently appeared on the streets of West Berlin during Ascension Day in Germany.
    A person dressed as Hitler stood on a car decorated with the swastika. Next to the driver dressed in SS uniform were two attendants wearing the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ribbon. The "Fuehrer" stretched out his arm, saluting passers-by. A large banner erected on the car read: "I am on leave for 24 hours, directly from Hell." They also carried several signs, one of which read: "Comrades, hold on, I will return, and everyone will have good days."

　　希特勒卷土重来
　　西柏林出现化装游行
    新华社19日讯　柏林消息：在重新武装西德声中，希特勒的鬼影最近在德国升天节的时候在西柏林街头出现。
    一个化装成希特勒的人站在一辆饰有卍字徽的汽车上，在穿党卫军军服的司机旁边还有两个佩带铁十字骑士勋章绶带的侍从。“元首”直伸着手臂向路人敬礼。在车上高高架起的横幅大标语写着：“我是请假二十四小时直接从地狱中来的”。他们还带有几幅标语，其中一幅标语写着：“同志们，要坚持，我将要回来，大家会有好日子过。”
