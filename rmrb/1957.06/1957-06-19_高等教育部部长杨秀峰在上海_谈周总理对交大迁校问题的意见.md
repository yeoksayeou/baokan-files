Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, in Shanghai on the 17th regarding the Jiaotong University relocation issue. He told the reporter that the State Council convened a meeting in early June with heads of Jiaotong University and relevant departments, as well as related universities in Shanghai and Xi'an, to discuss the relocation of Jiaotong University. At the meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai gave a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the Jiaotong University relocation issue and proposed solutions. Currently, faculty and students at Jiaotong University in Shanghai and Xi'an are conducting extensive discussions on the solutions proposed by the Premier.

    The Jiaotong University Relocation Issue Should Be Carefully Considered

    Yang Xiufeng briefly relayed to the reporter the main content of the solutions proposed by Premier Zhou regarding the Jiaotong University relocation issue. He said that the Premier first pointed out the complexity of the Jiaotong University relocation issue, noting that it had involved many aspects, departments, and schools. Therefore, when considering the relocation of Jiaotong University, all factors should be taken into account.

    Departmental Adjustments are Necessary

    The Premier started by discussing the issue of departmental adjustments in universities, stating that this policy stemmed from the inability of higher education in old China to meet the specific requirements of socialist construction in new China. China was backward, and the history of higher education was only a few decades old. The number of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, cultivated through school education was very small. According to the requirements of the Common Program and the Constitution for education, the foundation of higher education in old China was inadequate. Many disciplines needed to be supplemented, and many specialties needed to be developed. Furthermore, the arrangement of universities in the past did not fully adapt to the requirements of the new economic deployment. The layout of industry and education in old China was unbalanced and unreasonable. If these basic facts were not recognized, it would be impossible to understand the necessity of various reforms after liberation, and it would be difficult to understand the necessity of departmental adjustments in higher education. Departmental adjustment is a reform in education, and we should affirm this reform's need for new China. Otherwise, from different perspectives, it is easy to overemphasize the shortcomings and even negate everything, causing ideological confusion.

    The Premier said: The policy and plan for departmental adjustments in universities in the past were based on certain reasons. The domestic and international situation at that time was such that American imperialism was unwilling to accept our victory internationally, and the victory of the socialist revolution had not yet been achieved domestically. Therefore, before 1956, our work had to take into account both the international situation and the old weaknesses existing domestically. The relocation of industries inland and the relocation of Jiaotong University inland were proposed based on the requirements of the construction of the Northwest industrial base and the requirements of national defense. The Northwest was backward in the past, but it must become our solid rear in the future. It has abundant resources and the conditions to become our Ural. However, the completion of the Northwest region and another industrial base, the Southwest region, would be inconceivable without the support of the advanced coastal areas. In order to overcome the unbalanced development of culture and education, it was also necessary to make appropriate adjustments and relocation from the coastal areas inland. Shanghai had a large number of senior intellectuals and better technical conditions, so it was natural to transfer more people from Shanghai.

    Based on the above requirements, the decision was made to relocate Jiaotong University to the Northwest, to adjust the telecommunications department to the Southwest, and to move the Aviation Academy to the interior.

    The Premier pointed out that the positive role of departmental adjustments should be affirmed, which is the main aspect. However, this does not mean that everything in the departmental adjustments was done correctly. There were also shortcomings and inappropriate arrangements. There are two reasons for the shortcomings and errors, some of which are avoidable and some of which are unavoidable. There are always problems that no one sees or anticipates. The more thorough the consideration beforehand, the fewer the shortcomings, but it is impossible to foresee everything correctly.

    The Premier said that 1956 was a turning point. At that time, the international tension eased, and the basic victory of the socialist revolution was achieved domestically. Due to the change in circumstances, a new deployment was needed to better facilitate construction. Therefore, Chairman Mao raised the issue of the Ten Major Relationships at the Supreme State Council meeting in May last year. However, the shift in work is not easy, especially in a large country, where turning around is slow. The relocation of Jiaotong University inland was also at this turning point, so this problem arose. It is difficult to say that someone was "acting arbitrarily."

　　Shanghai is Duty-Bound to Support Other Regions

    After analyzing the above aspects, the Premier talked about the Jiaotong University relocation itself. The Premier believed that the decision to relocate Jiaotong University inland in 1955 was correct and necessary in order to support the construction of the Northwest and consider the coastal situation. At that time, the difficulties of relocating Jiaotong University inland were not overlooked. Why not expand the existing universities in the Northwest to meet the needs of cultural and educational construction in the Northwest? Because the planned speed of industrial construction at that time was fast and urgent, and relocating Jiaotong University could produce faster results. Although there were difficulties in relocating Jiaotong University, the difficulties had to be overcome because the country needed it. Therefore, this decision was correct. The Premier believed that the situation in 1956 was that Jiaotong University could be relocated or not, or it could send some forces to solve the problem. After the "Ten Major Relationships" were raised, Jiaotong University could not be relocated according to the new situation and new arrangements. But on the other hand, from the perspective of the needs of the Northwest construction, the Xi'an campus had been built, more than 2,000 students had been enrolled, and it was difficult to develop in Shanghai, and the shipbuilding college was about to be built, so the decision was still made to relocate, and half of it was relocated. Although it was discussed at that time, the discussion was not extensive enough. This year, difficulties arose, forming a situation that some people described as "riding a tiger." This difficulty was caused by domestic and international reasons, as well as reasons inside and outside the school, and had a great impact on all aspects. Judging from the problems that have occurred, it has affected the doubts of some schools about the departmental adjustments of universities in the past. We must affirm the policy of departmental adjustments. And we must establish the principle that everything is for the needs of socialist construction. If all the adjusted schools return to their hometowns because Jiaotong University is not moving to Xi'an, it will not be possible to quickly build new socialist industrial bases in the Northwest and Southwest. The shortcomings of departmental adjustments must be overcome, but the correct policy cannot be negated. There will be necessary adjustments in the future, but experience has been gained and will be more cautious.

    The Premier put forward the guiding principles and plans for solving the Jiaotong University relocation issue. He believes that the focus must be based on everything that is conducive to socialist construction, everything for better mobilizing forces to serve the construction of socialism, and transforming negative factors into positive factors. Consideration of the Jiaotong University issue cannot be separated from this principle.

    The Premier proposed that, in general, there are only two options: one is to move entirely to Xi'an, and the other is to move back to Shanghai.

    Although There Are Difficulties in Moving Jiaotong University Entirely to Xi'an, There Are Many Advantages

    Insisting on moving to Xi'an, teachers who cannot go are not forced, as long as most of the teachers go, and the old foundation of Jiaotong University is still preserved, which is very beneficial to the construction of the Northwest. The disadvantage is that the conditions for teaching and scientific research are currently worse than Shanghai in terms of combining with off-campus resources, but from a distance, it will still be possible in a few years. The Northwest includes seven provinces in Shanxi and Henan, and Xi'an is the center. The Northwest region needs Jiaotong University. The Party leadership in the Northwest welcomes Jiaotong University. The Northwest construction is developing, and the speed of construction is slightly slower than planned in the past, but it is still active, and the prospects for industrial development are broad. But not everything is good in the Northwest, and there are still many difficulties. As an industrial base, there are many unfavorable conditions, such as a small labor force, few forests, little water conservancy, and many deserts. The culture in the Southeast is higher, but there are weaknesses that must be seen and guarded against. It is very beneficial to go to the Northwest to be tempered, especially for young people. Conditions that are too comfortable cannot temper people. The teachers, students, and staff who have already gone to Xi'an for a year have experienced the wind and frost, which is good. Among the more than 800 students graduating from Jiaotong University this year, there will also be a group who will respond to the call of the country to go to the Northwest to participate in construction in difficult places. If the remaining more than 1,000 students and hundreds of faculty and staff in Shanghai can accept going to Xi'an, I will not give up the possibility of a full relocation. The elderly and infirm who cannot go do not have to go, and can sometimes give lectures.

    There are many difficulties in moving to Xi'an currently, which can be gradually improved. But I don't want to force it too much either. If, after mobilization and persuasion, there are still many teachers who are unwilling to go, then consider moving back to Shanghai. There are advantages and many difficulties in moving Jiaotong University back to Shanghai, but the policy of supporting the Northwest remains unchanged

    The Premier said, why can we consider moving back to Shanghai? Because if it cannot be moved, it should not be forced too much. At the same time, the situation may allow for it, taking into account both the coastal areas and the interior. Shanghai also has needs. Jiaotong University has a history of more than 60 years in Shanghai and has close ties with all aspects of Shanghai, and has many favorable conditions in teaching and scientific research. Therefore, the policy of moving back to Shanghai also has its advantages and is also for the sake of needs. Even if Jiaotong University returns to Shanghai, it must do its utmost to support the construction of the Northwest. Otherwise, there is no way to face the people of the Northwest.

    The Premier said that three options can be considered for moving back to Shanghai:

    The first option is to leave more specialties in the Northwest. I envision that the specialties to be left are: one is new specialties, including several specialties that have not yet enrolled students or have already enrolled students, such as radio, high-voltage engineering, and thermal power equipment; the other is to ask Jiaotong University to consider whether there are other specialties or departments that will also go to Xi'an, so that the Northwest can get more help. Please study this carefully, but do not force it.

    The second option is to move all back to Shanghai, leaving none behind. This may not be good, and the teachers and students of Jiaotong University may not feel at ease.

    The third option is a compromise. Teachers and students who are willing to stay in Xi'an can stay in Xi'an, and first- and second-year students who are willing to stay in Xi'an can also transfer to new specialties, which will be set up in the Northwest. This is also very beneficial to supporting the Northwest. In short, we must start from unity, so that even after the teachers and students of Jiaotong University in Xi'an leave, the people of the Northwest will feel that Jiaotong University has come to the Northwest and is still beneficial to the people of the Northwest. This takes into account all aspects and is beneficial to the unity of the people of the whole country and to Jiaotong University. I believe that if the reasons are explained clearly, some people will be willing to stay in Xi'an.

    If moving back to Shanghai, no matter which option is adopted, it must be made clear that there will be many difficulties after returning. First of all, there is a contradiction with the Shipbuilding College on the issue of school buildings, which also involves many problems with Nanyang Institute of Technology, which must be considered in a coordinated manner. If all move back, there will not be enough space even if no students are enrolled this year. Therefore, there are many difficulties in moving back to Shanghai. The future development of Jiaotong University will also be limited. The national policy is that Shanghai cannot be greatly expanded, and investment in infrastructure construction will not be much. Therefore, the scale of Jiaotong University will be limited. In Shanghai, large-scale enterprises and industries will not be developed, and the off-campus conditions for Jiaotong University will also be limited. Of course, we can focus on improving quality and striving for excellence.

    Let Jiaotong University Teachers and Students Study and Consider Moving to Xi'an or Returning to Shanghai

    The Premier emphasized that the problems are all in front of everyone. Please have all the teachers and students of Jiaotong University discuss them carefully, consider them comprehensively, and after repeated discussions, the Jiaotong University School Committee should make a choice and submit it to the Ministry of Higher Education for approval.

    Yang Xiufeng said that the Premier repeatedly emphasized that the general principle is to seek a reasonable arrangement. Although the conditions have changed, the policy of supporting the Northwest cannot be changed. The Premier himself does not favor any one plan. The purpose is to care for Jiaotong University and to make Jiaotong University do well. He also pointed out that all the responsible comrades of the universities and departments present at the meeting must proceed from unity and take care of the overall situation in dealing with the issue of Jiaotong University.

　　高等教育部部长杨秀峰在上海
    谈周总理对交大迁校问题的意见
    新华社上海18日电　新华社记者17日就交通大学迁校问题访问了正在上海的高等教育部部长杨秀峰，他告诉记者：6月初国务院曾召开交通大学和各有关部门、上海、西安两地有关高等学校的负责人，讨论了交通大学迁校问题。会上，周恩来总理对交通大学迁校问题作了全面和详尽的分析，并对解决交通大学迁校问题提出了处理方案。目前上海和西安的交通大学师生，正在对总理提出的方案，进行广泛讨论。
    交大迁校问题应该周密考虑
    杨秀峰扼要地向记者转述了周总理提出的关于解决交通大学迁校问题的方案的主要内容。他说，总理首先指出了交通大学迁校问题的复杂性，认为这个问题，已牵涉到四面八方，好些部门和好些学校。因之考虑交通大学的迁校问题，应该瞻前顾后，左顾右盼，四面八方都考虑到。
    院系调整是必要的
    总理从高等学校院系调整问题谈起，他说，院系调整这一方针是由于旧中国高等教育不能适应新中国社会主义建设的具体要求而来的。中国落后，办高等教育的历史不过几十年，经过学校教育培养出来的知识分子，特别是高级知识分子数目是很小的。根据共同纲领和宪法对教育工作的要求，旧中国高等教育的底子是不相适应的。有许多学科的缺门必须补充，许多专业必须发展。再者，过去高等学校的设置安排也不尽适应新的经济部署的要求。旧中国工业的布局和教育的部署是不平衡不合理的。假如看不到这些基本情况，就无法理解解放后各项改革的必要性，也难于理解在高等教育方面进行院系调整的必要性。院系调整是教育上的一种改革，我们应将这种改革对新中国的需要肯定下来，否则从不同的眼光看，就容易过分强调缺点的一面，甚至否定一切，引起思想混乱。
    总理说：过去确定高等学校院系调整的方针和方案是有根据的。当时的国内外形势，在国际上美国帝国主义不甘心我们的胜利，国内尚未取得社会主义革命的胜利，因之在1956年以前，我们的工作不能不照顾到两方面的情况，即国际形势及对国内存在的旧的弱点的注意。工业内迁和交通大学内迁就是根据西北工业基地建设的要求和国防形势的要求下提出来的。西北过去是落后的，但将来必须成为我国巩固的后方，那里有丰富的资源，有条件成为我国的乌拉尔。但是，西北区以及另一工业基地西南区的建成，如果不靠沿海先进地区的支援是不可能设想的。为克服文化教育的畸形发展，从沿海方面作适当的调整和内迁，也是必要的。上海高级知识分子较多，技术条件较好，从上海调动多，是很自然的事。
    根据以上要求，才有交通大学迁西北，电讯系调整到西南，航空学院也移向内地发展。
    总理指出应肯定院系调整的积极作用，这是主要的一面。但也不是说院系调整一切都弄对了，也有缺点，有安排不当的。产生缺点错误的原因，也有两种情况，有些是可免的，有些是难免的。没看到没料到的问题对任何人来说总是有的。事先考虑周到些，缺点就少些，但不可能什么事情都能预见得正确。
    总理说1956年是转变的关头，当时国际紧张局势趋向缓和，国内取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利，由于情况改变，为了更有利于建设，需要重新部署，因而去年5月毛主席在最高国务会议上提出了十大关系问题。但工作转变并不是容易的事，尤其国家大，转弯也慢。交通大学内迁也正处在这转变的关头，所以产生了这个问题，很难说那个人“一意孤行”。
　　上海支援外地义不容辞
    总理在将上述各方面情况作过分析之后，就谈到交通大学迁校本身问题。总理认为：1955年决定交通大学内迁是对的，为了支援西北建设和考虑沿海形势，是必要的。当时也不是没有想到交通大学内迁的困难。为什么不以扩充西北原有高等学校来解决西北文化教育建设的需要呢？因为当时设想的工业建设速度快，要得急，交通大学搬去，可以收效快些。交通大学搬去虽有困难，但既是国家需要，就要设法克服困难。因之这个决定是对的。总理认为：1956年情况是交通大学可搬可不搬，也可以由交通大学去支援一部分力量来解决问题。“十大关系问题”提出后，按照新的形势，作重新安排，交通大学可以不搬。但另一方面，从西北建设需要来说，从西安校舍已建，学生已招了两千多，要在上海发展有困难，造船学院又要建校来说，又可搬，所以仍决定搬，搬了一半。当时虽经过商量，但商量得不够广泛。到了今年，产生了困难，形成了如有些人所形容的“骑虎难下”的局势。这个困难是由国内外和校内外等等原因造成的，对各方面的影响也很大。从所发生的问题看来，已经影响到有些学校对过去高等学校院系调整的怀疑，我们必须肯定院系调整这一方针。并要确立一切为了社会主义建设需要的原则。如果因为交通大学不搬西安了，而所有调整的学校都要回老家，就不可能很快建设起西北、西南新的社会主义工业基地。院系调整的缺点要克服，但不能否定这一正确的方针。今后还会有必要的调整，但已取得了经验，会更加慎重。
    总理提出了解决交通大学迁校问题的方针和方案。认为着眼点必须要根据从一切有利于社会主义建设，一切为了更好地动员力量为建设社会主义服务，变消极因素为积极因素出发。考虑交通大学问题不能离开这一原则。
    总理提出从大的方面讲，不外：一是全搬西安，一是搬回上海。
    交大全搬西安虽有困难，但好处多
    坚持搬西安，少数不能去的教师不勉强，只要有大多数教师去，作到交通大学的老底子仍保存，那对西北建设很有利。其缺点是当前在进行教学和科学研究条件上同校外结合条件较上海差，但从远处看，过几年还是可以的。大西北包括山西、河南七个省区，西安是中心。西北地区是需要交通大学的。西北党的领导是欢迎交通大学的。西北建设正在发展，建设速度虽比过去计划稍为放慢，但仍是积极的，工业发展的前途是广阔的。但西北不是一切都好，困难还很多。作为工业基地，劳动力少，森林少，水利少，沙漠多等等，都是很不利的条件。东南文化高一些，但有弱点，要看到，要警惕。能到西北去锻炼是很有好处的，尤其是青年，条件太舒服了，是不能锻炼人的。交通大学已去西安的师生员工经历一年风霜是好的。今年交通大学毕业八百多学生，其中也将有一批要响应国家号召到西北到艰苦的地方去参加建设。现在上海余下来一千多学生和几百位教职工，如果能够接受去西安，我并不放弃全搬的可能。年老体弱不能去的可以不去，有时去讲讲学。
    当前迁西安有很多困难，可以逐步改善。但我也不愿太勉强。如果经过动员劝说，仍有不少教师不愿去，那就考虑搬回上海。交大搬回上海有好处，也有不少困难，但支援西北的方针不变
    总理说为什么可以考虑搬回上海呢？因为搬不动，就不可太勉强。同时，形势也许可，沿海和内地兼顾，上海也还有需要，交通大学在上海有六十多年历史，同上海各方面关系密切，在教学和科学研究工作方面有许多有利条件。所以搬回上海的方针，也有其好处，也是为了需要。交通大学即使回上海，也必须尽最大的可能支援西北建设。否则无以对西北人民。
    总理说搬回上海可考虑三个方案：
    第一个方案是多留些专业在西北。我设想所留专业：一种是新的专业，包括尚未招生及已招生的无线电、高压工程、热能动力装置等几个专业；另一种请交通大学考虑是否还有其他的专业或系也去西安，使西北得到较多的帮助，请大家研究不可勉强。
    第二个方案是全部搬回上海，一个不留。这怕不好，交通大学师生恐也于心不安。
    第三个方案是折中方案，师生愿留西安的留西安，一、二年级学生愿留西安学习的也可转专业，新专业设西北。这样对支援西北也有很大好处。总之，要从团结出发，即使交通大学西安师生走了以后，也使西北人民感到交通大学到西北来一趟，对西北人民还是有好处的。这样做就照顾到各方面，对全国人民的团结有利，对交通大学也有利。我相信将道理讲清，会有些人愿在西安的。
    如果搬回上海，无论采取那个方案，都必须讲清，回去以后困难很多。首先在校舍问题上同造船学院有矛盾，也涉及到南洋工学院许多问题，要统筹兼顾。如全部搬回，即使今年不招生，也摆不下。因此搬回上海是有许多困难的。对交通大学今后的发展也将受到局限，上海不能大扩建是国家的方针，基建投资不可能多，因而交通大学规模要受限制。在上海，大规模的企业工业不会搞，交通大学校外条件配合上也有局限性。当然可以着重提高质量、求精。
    迁西安，回上海由交大师生研究考虑
    总理着重指出，问题都摆在大家面前，请交通大学全体师生自己好好讨论，全面考虑，经反复讨论后，由交通大学校委会作出选择，报送高等教育部批准。
    杨秀峰说，总理再三强调：总的原则是求得合理安排，条件虽然变了，但是支援西北的方针是不能变的。总理自己是不偏于那一个方案的，目的是爱护交通大学，要交通大学搞好。并且指出，所有到会的各高等学校和各部门的负责同志，在处理交通大学这一问题中必须一切从团结出发，照顾大局。
