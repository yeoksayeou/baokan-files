　　Ngo Dinh Diem's Treasonous Acts Bring Disaster to the People
　　American Troops Act Tyrannically in South Vietnam
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 15th: According to Saigon's "Yan Lun Bao," personnel from an American military delegation in South Vietnam recently ran over and killed an eight-year-old Vietnamese child while driving a jeep on a highway near Saigon. Only under the firm demands of the surrounding masses did Ngo Dinh Diem's police reluctantly detain the American.
　　This is the first time that South Vietnamese newspapers have publicly reported on the crimes of Americans in South Vietnam.
　　An Indian "Blitz" weekly reporter who visited Saigon said that the outside world rarely knows about the barbaric behavior of Americans in South Vietnam because "Ngo Dinh Diem is unwilling to wash his friends' dirty linen in public."
　　This Indian reporter reported the following facts based on what he saw and heard in South Vietnam: On one occasion, four Americans got drunk in a hotel in Di'an, and one of them pushed a Vietnamese waiter onto the table, splashing food and wine on another American, who immediately pulled out a pistol and shot the waiter dead.
　　On another occasion, three American soldiers pulled a Vietnamese child riding a bicycle off his bike in an alley for ringing his bell to ask them to make way, beat him severely, destroyed his bicycle, and then swaggered away.
　　One day, an American soldier molested a Vietnamese girl on a bridge. When the girl resisted, the American soldier pushed her into the river. A South Vietnamese policeman who was present did not dare to interfere.
　　The "Blitz" weekly reporter wrote that seeing the arrogant attitude of Americans in South Vietnam makes one wonder whether Americans live in Ngo Dinh Diem's territory or Ngo Dinh Diem lives in American territory.
　　Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Albany, New York dispatch: In order to help the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities strengthen their rule over the people of South Vietnam, the United States has decided to send three police officers from New York State to South Vietnam to help the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities establish a police force. The three police officers include Updyke, the director of the New York State Bureau of Criminal Investigation. They will depart in August and are scheduled to work in South Vietnam for two years.

### 吴庭艳卖国祸延人民  美军在南越横行霸道

    吴庭艳卖国祸延人民
    美军在南越横行霸道
    新华社河内15日电　据西贡“言论报”报道，一个美国驻南越军事代表团的人员最近开着吉普车在西贡附近的公路上辗死了一个八岁的越南儿童。只是在周围群众的坚决要求下，吴庭艳的警察才不得不把那个美国人拘留起来。
    南越报纸公开报道美国人在南越的犯罪行为，这还是第一次。
    曾经访问过西贡的印度“闪电”周报记者说，外界很少知道美国人在南越的横蛮行为，是因为“吴庭艳不愿意把他的朋友的肮脏衣服拿到公众面前去洗”。
    这位印度记者就他在南越的所见所闻报道了下列这些事实：有一回，四个美国人在堤岸的一家酒店中喝得大醉，其中一个美国人把越南招待员往桌上推去，把桌上酒菜溅到另一个美国人身上，这个美国人就立即掏出手枪来把招待员打死。
    又有一次，三个美国兵在一条小巷里把一个骑着自行车按铃要求他们让路的越南儿童拉下车来毒打了一顿，还把他的自行车捣毁，然后扬长而去。
    有一天，一个美国兵在一座桥上调戏一位越南少女，少女不依，美国兵竟然把她推下河去。当时在场的一名南越警察却不敢进行干涉。
      “闪电”周报记者写道，看到美国人在南越的横蛮态度，就会使人怀疑究竟是美国人生活在吴庭艳的领土上，还是吴庭艳生活在美国的领土上。
    新华社15日讯　纽约州阿耳巴尼消息：美国为了帮助吴庭艳当局加强对南越人民的统治，决定派遣纽约州的三名警官前往南越，帮助吴庭艳当局建立警察部队。三名警官中包括纽约州罪犯调查局局长厄普代克。他们将在8月间动身，预定在南越工作两年。
