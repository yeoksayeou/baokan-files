　　To attempt to shake the Party's leadership is something we will resolutely not permit!
　　Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University
    The Chinese Communist Party serves the people wholeheartedly; this is obvious to all honest people. In order to overcome shortcomings, improve work, strengthen unity, strengthen the Party's leadership, and accelerate our country's socialist construction, we have now launched a rectification movement, asking the people to offer opinions to the Party and help the Party rectify its work. A ruling party that so humbly listens to the opinions of the masses is unprecedented in history. In the past, rulers also "issued edicts seeking advice" and "broadly opened channels of communication," but they were limited to a few censors and remonstrators. How could that compare to soliciting opinions on such a broad scale? Moreover, their so-called "issuing edicts seeking advice" was merely to maintain the interests of their own family and clan, and it cannot be compared to the current rectification movement. Today, the rectification movement led by the Communist Party is for the benefit of the 600 million people of the country, and it has no other purpose. This is very clear because the Communist Party has no special interests of its own other than the interests of the people; the interests of the Party and the people are consistent. The Communist Party cannot be separated from the masses; without the masses, it will accomplish nothing. The masses even more cannot be separated from the leadership of the Communist Party; without the Party's leadership, they will lose their direction forward.
    I think history is the most powerful witness, and facts are the best explanation. The existence of the majestic Mount Tai is an objective fact; one cannot say it does not exist simply because someone closes their eyes and does not look. We who study history believe even more in historical facts.
    Eight years ago, we, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrew the oppression of us by imperialism all over the world, overthrew the reactionary rule that rode roughshod over the people, and the people truly became the masters of the country. We felt glory and pride from the bottom of our hearts! When Chairman Mao solemnly announced at the founding of the People's Republic of China: "The Chinese people have stood up!" I myself was filled with a myriad of emotions, and a thousand words could not express the complex feelings in my heart at that time. Because people of my age are even more deeply aware of how rich the content of the Chinese people standing up is, how many moving and heroic deeds it contains, how precious it is, and how proud we can be.
    In the past eight years, we have experienced earth-shaking changes; this is a glorious page in history. We have basically transformed the thousands-year-old private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership; the thousands-year-old unreasonable system of human exploitation of man will be eliminated forever; all people will become different types of laborers. "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before."
    Since the national liberation, in a short period of a few years, we have done work that could not be completed in the previous decades, and we have achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory in socialist transformation. Currently, our 600 million people, who account for one-quarter of the world's population, are engaged in socialist construction with great enthusiasm, and we are further changing the face of the country with our own labor. Our industry, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, domestic and foreign trade, culture, education, and health, etc., have all made huge and rapid progress, and the living standards of the broad masses of the people are constantly improving.
    Our working people are creating countless miracles. Can these concrete and vivid facts before our eyes be achieved without the leadership of the Communist Party?
    Before liberation, we intellectuals suffered from dual oppression in politics and economics, our bodies and minds were devastated, and we were mentally distressed. Wasn't I myself squeezed into an ever-narrowing range of life by the environment at that time, forced to hide in piles of books and seek a living by separating myself from reality? The lives of intellectuals were not guaranteed; scientific research was not valued, and the results of research even had nowhere to be published. Professors teaching in universities were still envied by other intellectuals, but wasn't their life still pitifully poor, with their monthly salary not even lasting a week? I myself once had to sell the "Ming Shilu" because I couldn't afford to hospitalize my child for treatment. Later, I also sold the "Dazhengzang" and the "Daozang," etc. One copy of the "Dazhengzang" in the Peking University Library today was bought from me. After liberation, we ended our old lives and enthusiastically threw ourselves into the construction of the motherland. We understand how today's happiness was obtained, and we also understand the difficulty of obtaining happiness. We know even more deeply the arduousness of our future cause. Therefore, we love the Party, and we are determined to take the socialist road. Under the leadership of the Party, we consciously accepted Marxist theory and transformed our old thinking in order to do more and better things for the rapidly developing socialist construction.
    In the face of these undeniable facts, how can some people still turn a blind eye, turn a deaf ear, distort the truth, and confuse right and wrong? I think the most important reason is due to different standpoints. We drove away the imperialists, and the Chinese people said it was very good. The imperialists said it was messed up because they no longer had a place to invade in China. The land reform abolished the feudal exploitative land ownership system and liberated the rural productive forces. The peasants said it was very good, while the landlord class said the land reform's shortcomings were the main thing. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries consolidated social order and strengthened national security. We said it was done well and had to be done, but the counter-revolutionaries said bad luck was the main thing. Isn't this a question of standpoint?
    Now, another fact is before us. When people are all sincerely helping the Party with rectification, the rightists think there is an opportunity to take advantage of and that they "have a lot to gain." They claim to represent us intellectuals and represent the masses, and under the guise of rectification, they frantically launch malicious attacks on the Party. This is simply a public declaration of war against the vast majority of people in the country. They exaggerate local shortcomings and insist that the work after liberation is "completely dark," that many things have been "messed up," that "the Party has reached a point of facing a crisis," and that "the Party has lost its ability to control," as if it is imperative to invite these rightists out to save the crisis. They are so arrogant that they don't know what they're doing. They are all aggressive and accuse today of being "the Party's world," saying that "intellectuals want to fight for democracy and freedom." So, they want to establish a "Political Design Institute," implement a bicameral system, and "rotate power among various parties." In universities, they want to "run schools democratically" and "abolish the Party committee system." All of these remarks ultimately show that the essence of their thinking is to usurp the Party's leadership, not wanting the Party's leadership. Isn't this very clear?
    However, they are wrong! They want a hundred schools of thought to contend for "power," to "compete for fame in the court and compete for profit in the fields," and they want to abolish or weaken the Party's leadership. This is the most fundamental issue of the interests of the broad masses of the people, and the masses will not allow them to succeed. The workers have spoken, and they say: "We are of one heart and one mind with the Communist Party!" They say: "If you want to overthrow the Communist Party, we will not allow it. If we do not allow it, you will not be able to overthrow it!" This truly represents the voice of hundreds of millions of people. The peasants have also spoken, and the intellectuals have also spoken: The Party's leadership cannot be shaken. To pull us onto the capitalist road and make society regress is something we will resolutely not allow!
    The rectification movement is originally a movement of criticism and self-criticism to raise ideological awareness, but in this movement, some people have ulterior motives and attempt to fish in troubled waters. Some remarks are even anti-Party and anti-socialist. These remarks harm the most basic interests of our people, and we must severely refute and counter them, launch an ideological and political struggle with them, and then the rectification can be carried out better and more deeply. We must smash those harmful remarks to defend the Party's leadership and strengthen the Party's leadership to better build the socialist motherland. In this current struggle, it is precisely a good opportunity for our broad masses, especially intellectuals, to receive education, raise awareness, and temper themselves. Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is our ideological weapon in the struggle. In this struggle against the rightists, we must stand firm, adhere to the truth, learn to distinguish right from wrong, and temper ourselves to be stronger in order to better undertake the new tasks of the new historical period.

　　想动摇党的领导，我们坚决不答应！
　　北京师范大学校长  陈垣
    中国共产党是全心全意为人民服务的，这是一切正直的人们有目所共睹。为了克服缺点、改进工作、加强团结、加强党的领导，为了加速我们国家的社会主义建设，因此现在提出了进行一次整风运动，要求人民群众向党提意见，要求大家帮助党整风。这样虚心地听取群众意见的执政党，是历史上所从来没有过的。旧时的统治者，也曾有过
  “下诏求言”“广开言路”的事情，但是他们仅仅限于几个御史、谏官，那能有在这样广泛的征求面来征求意见的呢？而且他们所谓“下诏求言”，不过是为了维持自己一家一姓的利益，根本是不能和现在整风相提并论的。今天共产党所领导的整风运动，是为了全国六亿人民的利益，并没有其他目的，这是很显然的。因为共产党除了人民的利益以外，就再没有什么自己的特殊的利益，党和人民的利益是一致的。共产党不能离开群众，离开群众就将一事无成；群众也更不能离开共产党，离开了党的领导，就会迷失了前进的方向。
    我想历史是最有力的见证，事实是最好的说明。巍峨的泰山的存在，是客观事实，总不能因有人闭着眼睛不看，就说它没有存在。我们研究历史的人，就更相信历史的事实。
    八年以前，我们中国人民在共产党领导之下，推翻了全世界帝国主义对我们的压迫，推翻了骑在人民头上作威作福的反动统治，人民自己真正作了国家的主人，我们从心里感到光荣和骄傲！当毛主席在中华人民共和国成立的时候，庄严宣布：“中国人从此站起来了！”我自己当时真是百感丛生，千言万语说不出当时心中的复杂滋味。因为像我这样年纪的人，是更能深刻的懂得中国人民站起来有着多么丰富的内容，包含着多少可歌可泣的事迹，是多么值得珍贵又是多么可以自豪的事情。
    八年来，我们经历了翻天复地的变革，这是历史上光辉灿烂的一页。我们把几千年的生产资料私有制，已基本上改变为社会主义公有制；几千年的人剥削人的不合理的制度，要从此永远消灭；所有的人都要变为不同类型的劳动者。“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”
    全国解放以后，短短的几年时间，我们已作了以往几十年所不能完成的工作，已取得了社会主义改造的全面的决定性的胜利。目前我们占全世界人口四分之一的六亿人民，正在热火朝天的从事于社会主义建设，我们正在用自己的劳动进一步改变着国家的面貌。我们的工业、农业、水利、运输、国内外贸易、文教卫生等等，都有巨大而迅速的进展，广大人民群众的生活水平正在不断的提高。
    我们劳动人民正在创造着说不完数不尽的奇迹，这些摆在眼前的具体而生动的事实，难道是离开了共产党的领导所能取得的吗？
    解放前，我们知识分子在政治上、经济上受着双重压迫，身心受到摧残，精神苦闷。我自己还不就是被当时环境把生活范围越挤越狭窄，只有躲在书堆里，在脱离实际中求生活吗？知识分子的生活得不到保障；科学研究不被重视，研究成果甚或是无处发表。在大学里教书的教授还是为其他知识分子所称羡的，但是生活还不是窘得可怜，每月发了工资连一星期都过不了吗？我自己就曾因为给孩子治病没钱住院，无可奈何的把“明实录”卖掉的。前后又曾卖掉“大正藏”和“道藏”等等。现在北京大学图书馆的“大正藏”有一部就是在我这里买去的。解放以后，我们结束了旧日生活，欢欣鼓舞的投到祖国的建设里，我们懂得今天的幸福是怎样得来的，也了解幸福得来的不易，更深知我们今后事业的艰巨，因此我们热爱党，我们坚决要走社会主义道路。我们在党的领导下，自觉的接受了马克思主义理论，改造自己的旧思想，以期能为突飞猛进的社会主义建设更多更好的作点事情。
    在这些不可抹煞的事实面前，怎么还有人竟视而不见，听而不闻，颠倒黑白，混淆是非呢？我看最重要的原因，就是由于立场不同的关系。我们把帝国主义赶走，中国人民说好得很，帝国主义说搞糟了，在中国没有侵略的地盘了；土地改革废除了封建剥削的土地所有制，解放了农村生产力，农民说好得很，而地主阶级说土地改革缺点是主要的；肃反运动巩固了社会秩序，加强了国家安全，我们说搞得好，不搞不行，反革命分子却说倒霉是主要的。这不是立场问题，是什么问题呢？
    现在有另一个事实摆在我们面前了。当人们都在善意帮助党整风的时候，右派分子却以为是有机可乘、“大有可为”了，竟口称是代表我们知识分子、代表群众，假借整风之名，猖狂的向党进行恶意的攻击，这简直是公然向全国绝大多数人来进行宣战了。他们把局部缺点夸大，硬说解放后的工作“漆黑一团”，很多事都“搞糟了”，“党已到了面临危机的时候”，“党已失掉了控制能力”，大有非请他们这些右派出来挽救危局不可之势。他们狂妄得不知所以了，一个个都气势汹汹，诬蔑今天是“党天下”，说“知识分子要争民主、争自由”了。于是要成立“政治设计院”，实行两院制，“各党派轮流执政”，在高等学校里要“民主办校”，“取消党委制”。所有这些言论，归根结底都说明，他们的思想实质是要篡夺党的领导权，不要党的领导，这还不是很清楚的事吗？
    但是，他们想错了！他们要百家争“权”，要“争名于朝，争利于野”，要想取消或削弱党的领导，这是广大群众最根本的利益问题，群众是不允许他们得逞的。工人说话了，他们说：“我们和共产党一条心一条命！”他们说：“你要推翻共产党，我们不答应；我们不答应，你就推翻不了！”这才是真正代表亿万群众的声音。农民也说话了，知识分子也发言了：党的领导不可动摇，要想把我们拉到资本主义道路上去，使社会后退，我们坚决不答应！
    整风运动本来就是一个提高思想觉悟的批评和自我批评的运动，可是在这个运动里，有些人别有用心，企图混水摸鱼，有些言论甚至是反党反社会主义的。这些言论害及我们人民的最基本的利益，我们必须严厉的予以驳斥，予以回击，和他们展开思想上、政治上的斗争，然后整风才能更好更深入的进行。我们必须粉碎那些有害的言论，来保卫党的领导、来加强党的领导，才能更好的建设社会主义祖国。在这当前的斗争中，也正是我们广大群众，特别是知识分子，受到教育、提高觉悟、锻炼自己的好机会。毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，就是我们斗争的思想武器，我们在这场反右派的斗争里，站稳立场，坚持真理，学会明辨是非，把自己锻炼得更坚强，以更好的担当起新的历史时期的新任务。
