Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: The Japan International Trade Promotion Association issued a statement yesterday, demanding that the Japanese government, based on the new situation, actively and resolutely promote a policy of relaxing or even abolishing the embargo restrictions against China.

	This trade group also submitted its statement to the Japanese government and many economic organizations.

	The association's statement said that the British government's decision to independently relax the embargo restrictions against China is consistent with our wishes. If Japan continues to support the embargo policy against China, Japan will be driven out of the Chinese market. This will bring significant losses to the Japanese economy.

	Representatives of thirteen trading companies in the Kansai region held a meeting in Osaka yesterday and decided to demand that the Japanese government relax the embargo restrictions against China to the level of Britain. The meeting also decided to demand the early abolition of the Paris "China Committee" and to request the Japanese government to sign the fourth trade agreement with China as soon as possible.

	Takami Shigeyoshi, Managing Director of the Japan-China Import and Export Association, said at a press conference that he believes the embargo against China has virtually collapsed. He said that Japan should be determined to expand trade with China.

	Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, said yesterday that four years have passed since the end of the Korean War, and the time has definitely come to review the list of the Paris "China Committee."

	Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, issued a statement today, again demanding that the Japanese government follow Britain's example and relax the embargo against China.
