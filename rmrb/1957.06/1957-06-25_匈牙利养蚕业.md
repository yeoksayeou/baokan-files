　　Hungarian Sericulture
　　There is a sericulture experimental station in Dorna County, Hungary, which has been established for seventy-five years. It is the best-equipped sericulture research institution in Hungary. Its work is divided into three aspects: first, the scientific experiments on silkworm eggs; second, the promotion of excellent varieties throughout the country; and third, the research on cocoon silk fibers.
　　The earliest silkworm eggs in Hungary came from Italy and France, and later domestic breeds were cultivated. The most popular silkworm variety in Hungary is the "Vanlo" breed, which is characterized by small cocoons, heavy weight, and abundant silk. The sericulture experimental station is currently conducting experiments on twenty-five types of silkworm eggs, including those sent this year from the Jiangsu Province Silkworm Seed Company in China. The growth period of Hungarian silkworms is thirty-two days, while the growth period of Chinese silkworms is only twenty-three days. This is a problem that the experimental station is currently studying. Last year, this experimental station had discussed sending people to China for a visit, but it was suspended due to the October events.
　　There are also silkworm eggs from Shandong Province, China, and the silk from these can be used to suture wounds. Currently, this type of cocoon silk is mainly used in medical applications.
　　The characteristics of this experimental station are that it has been established for a long time, and the instruments and equipment are relatively complete, equipped with various precision instruments, such as an instrument that can distinguish the weight of each silkworm egg, and can cut a silkworm larva the size of an ant into sixty to one hundred slices for experiments.

　　匈牙利养蚕业
    匈牙利多尔娜州有一个养蚕实验所，成立已有七十五年了，它是匈牙利设备最好的养蚕研究机构。工作任务分三方面：第一是对蚕种的科学实验，第二是把优良品种推广全国，第三是研究茧丝纤维。
    匈牙利最早的蚕种是从意大利和法国得来的，后来才培养出本国的蚕种。在匈牙利最受欢迎的蚕种是“凡洛”种，它的特点：茧小，量重，丝多。养蚕实验所现在进行实验的有二十五种蚕子，其中有今年从我国江苏省蚕种公司寄去的蚕子。匈牙利蚕的成长期有三十二天，中国蚕的成长期只有二十三天，这是实验所目前正在研究的一个问题。去年，这个实验所曾经讨论过要派人到我国来参观，后因为十月事件爆发而中止了。
    这里也有我国山东省的蚕种，这种蚕丝可以缝合伤口。目前生产的这类茧丝主要用于医疗方面。
    这个实验所的特点是成立时间较久，仪器设备比较齐全，备有各种精密仪器，如一种仪器可以区分每粒蚕子的重量，可以把一条像蚂蚁大小的幼蚕切成六十片到一百片来实验。（附图片）
