Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th: At U.S. President Eisenhower's press conference on the 26th, a reporter pointed out to him that the U.S. government indeed seemed hesitant on the issue of halting nuclear weapons tests, unwilling to give a clear "yes" or "no" answer.

Eisenhower's response to this point revealed the U.S.'s ulterior motives on this issue. He said that the U.S. needed "four or five years" to continue nuclear weapons testing in order to create a so-called "absolutely clean" bomb that doesn't release particles. He also used the excuse that tests "must continue" in order to obtain "full knowledge" for the "peaceful" use of atomic energy. On this point, Eisenhower's words echoed the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at his press conference on the 25th. Dulles said at the time that if testing were to be stopped, the U.S. would also consider the cessation period should be short enough so as not to affect the U.S. nuclear weapons research institutions.

Despite this, under pressure from world public opinion, Eisenhower was still forced to verbally express that the U.S. was willing to stop nuclear weapons testing. However, he put forward preconditions, saying that this required simultaneous agreement on stopping the production of fissile materials used to manufacture weapons, and also the implementation of a limited inspection plan, and, if possible, some beginning in the area of universal disarmament.

When talking about the issue of the U.S. withdrawing some troops from Japan, Eisenhower said that this was to "streamline" personnel and increase the power of new weapons. He also said that the U.S. did not have plans to withdraw troops from other locations.

When reporters asked what attitude the U.S. was taking towards the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to convene an international conference to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, Eisenhower refused to give a direct answer.

　　美政府仍要继续核武器试验
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯一唱一和
    新华社27日讯  华盛顿消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔26日举行的记者招待会上，有记者向他指出，在停止核武器试验方面，美国政府的确有些迟疑，不愿意讲一句干脆的赞成或者是不赞成。
    艾森豪威尔对这一点的回答暴露了美国在这个问题上的不可告人的目的。他说，美国需要“四五年的时间”继续进行核武器试验，以制造一种所谓不带微粒的“绝对干净的”炸弹。他还借口说为了获得“和平”利用原子能的“充分知识”，试验也“必须继续进行下去”。关于这一点，艾森豪威尔的话是和美国国务卿杜勒斯25日在记者招待会上的谈话相呼应的。杜勒斯当时说，如果停止试验的话，美国也认为停止的期限要短到使美国的核武器研究机构不致受到影响。
    尽管如此，迫于世界舆论，艾森豪威尔还是不得不在口头上表示美国愿意停止核武器试验。但是他又提出先决条件说，这要同时在停止生产用于制造武器的裂变物质方面取得协议，并且还要实行有限度的视察计划和可能的话在普遍裁减军备方面作出某种开端。
    在谈到美国从日本撤退一部分军队的问题时，艾森豪威尔说，这是为了“精简”人员和增加新武器的威力。他又说，美国并没有从其他地方撤退军队的计划。
    当记者们问到美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于召开国际会议，讨论从朝鲜撤退外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的建议采取什么态度时，艾森豪威尔拒作正面回答。
