Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 12th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, stated at the plenary session of the World Peace Council's Colombo meeting on the afternoon of June 11th that the power of the people far exceeds the power of atomic energy.

Amidst prolonged cheers, Guo Moruo said, "Only by eradicating old and new colonialism can the world achieve genuine and lasting peace." He said that the era of colonialism is gone forever. He advised Western friends not to have any lingering attachment or illusions about colonialism.

Guo Moruo said that Colombo is the birthplace of the Bandung spirit. Panchsheel should become the guiding principle of international relations. He said, "When all countries act in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, there will never be war."

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people, as one of the initiators of Panchsheel, "have consistently adhered to these principles in handling all international affairs."

Guo Moruo said that the Soviet government, one of the three major countries possessing atomic weapons, has repeatedly proposed banning the use of atomic weapons and banning the testing of such weapons. However, the U.S. and British governments, disregarding the wishes of the people of the world, have used various excuses to refuse to stop the tests and reject the Soviet proposals. He demanded that the U.S. and British governments accept the Soviet proposals as soon as possible and reach an agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons and on disarmament.

Guo Moruo said, "The U.S. government has been engaging in military installations in other countries and even storing missiles. It arbitrarily interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. It blindly implements monopoly policies. It imposes embargoes on other countries. It hinders cultural exchanges. It creates tensions. All of this is to obtain monopoly profits from arms production."

Guo Moruo said, "The United States provides dollars in the name of 'aid' with political and military conditions attached. The United States uses this method to infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of other countries." He said, "This new colonialism of the United States is replacing old colonialism."

Guo Moruo recalled the Chinese people's experience of the "benevolence and mercy" of U.S. policy. He said, "Even now, the U.S. government is still supporting Chiang Kai-shek and still occupies our territory of Taiwan."

Guo Moruo pointed out that the nature of Dulles' so-called U.S. policy of "aiding Free China" has been clearly demonstrated in the recent Taipei incident. He said, "The people of Taiwan are the Chinese people. The Chinese people will not tolerate any enslavement by any colonialists." He said, "The riots against American aggressors that have occurred in Taiwan have triggered chain reactions everywhere. The calls against the U.S. military's high-handed policies are growing stronger."

Guo Moruo said that the United States manipulates the United Nations to prevent the People's Republic of China from restoring its status in the United Nations, but this fact does not mean that the country of China does not exist on Earth.

Referring to the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva, which have dragged on for nearly two years, Guo Moruo said, "We are definitely able to compete with Mr. Dulles and his colleagues in patience."

Guo Moruo said that the British action to break free from U.S. influence and relax the embargo on China is "wise." It is natural that this action has been approved by many countries. He said that it seems that now is the time for the decision-makers in the United States to be a little more wise.

　　人民的力量远远超过原子能的力量
　　郭沫若在世界和平理事会上痛斥殖民主义
    新华社科伦坡12日电  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若6月11日下午在世界和平理事会科伦坡会议第二天全体会议上说，人民的力量远远超过原子能的力量。
    郭沫若在长时间的欢呼声中说：“只有在根绝了旧的和新的殖民主义政策的时候，世界才能得到真正的持久和平。”他说，殖民主义的时代已经一去不返了。他忠告西方朋友们对殖民主义不要再有所依恋，不要再抱任何幻想。
    郭沫若说，科伦坡是万隆精神的发源地。潘查希拉应当成为国际关系的指导原则。他说：“当一切国家都按照五项原则办事的时候，就永远不会有战争了。”
    郭沫若说，作为潘查希拉的发起者之一的中国人民，“在处理一切国际事务方面一贯遵守这些原则”。
    郭沫若说，拥有原子武器的三大国之一的苏联政府一再建议禁止使用原子武器和禁止这种武器的爆炸试验。他说，但是，美国和英国政府不顾世界人民的愿望，以各种借口拒绝停止爆炸试验和苏联的建议。他要求美国和英国政府尽早接受苏联的建议。在无条件禁止原子武器和核武器以及在裁军问题上达成协议。
    郭沫若说：“美国政府一直在其他国家中从事军事设施，甚至贮存导弹。它专横地干涉其他国家的内政。它一味执行垄断政策。它对其他国家实行禁运。它阻碍文化交流。它制造紧张局势。所有这一切都是为了获得军备生产的垄断利润。”
    郭沫若说：“美国在附有政治和军事条件的‘援助’的名义下提供美元。美国用这种办法侵犯其他国家的主权和独立。”他说：“美国的这种新的殖民主义正在代替旧的殖民主义。”
    郭沫若追述了中国人民对于美国政策的“恩惠和慈悲”的体验。他说：“甚至现在，美国政府仍然在支持蒋介石，并且仍然还占领着我国的领土台湾。”
    郭沫若指出，杜勒斯的所谓美国“援助自由中国”的政策的性质，已经清楚地表现在最近的台北事件上面。他说：“台湾人民是中国人民。中国人民不会容忍任何殖民主义者的任何奴役。”他说：“台湾所发生的反对美国侵略者的暴动，已经在各地引起了连锁反应。反对美国军事高压政策的呼声在日益强烈。”
    郭沫若说：美国操纵联合国不让中华人民共和国恢复它在联合国的地位，但是这一事实并不意味着地球上不存在中国这样一个国家。
    郭沫若谈到拖了几乎两年之久的日内瓦中美会谈的时候说：“我们是一定能够同杜勒斯先生和他的同僚们比一比耐心的。”
    郭沫若说，英国摆脱美国的影响而放宽对华禁运的行动是“明智的”。这一行动得到许多国家的赞同是很自然的。他说，看起来现在是美国的决策者应该更加明智一些的时候了。
