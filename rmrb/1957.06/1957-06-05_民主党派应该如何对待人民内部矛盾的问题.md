How Should Democratic Parties Handle Contradictions Among the People?
Li Boqiu, Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

After the basic establishment of the socialist system in our country, we are in a great new historical period. On the basis of the victory of class struggle, it is necessary to unite the people of all nationalities and all social strata as widely as possible, to bring into play all positive forces, to struggle against nature, and to constantly win great victories. Human society has gone through a long history of class struggle, and has also accumulated rich experience in the struggle against nature, creating modern science and culture. However, in class society, productive labor cannot but be controlled and exploited by the ruling class, and the development of productive forces cannot but be constrained. Only by overthrowing the rule of the exploiting classes, eliminating private ownership, and establishing a socialist system, can productive forces be completely liberated, can human labor wisdom be fully utilized, can science and technology be fully utilized and constantly created, and, on the basis of highly developed science and technology, can nature be fully controlled, the inexhaustible treasures of nature be utilized, and production be continuously improved to meet human needs. Our society has been liberated from the rule of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society for only eight years, and has also achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution, leaping into a new historical period. This is an unprecedented and incomparable great change in history, and profound and complex contradictions are taking place in all aspects of society. The main issue is the contradictions among the people, and the exposure of contradictions and the solution of problems are the key to turning negativity into positivity and accelerating socialist development. Therefore, Chairman Mao made a timely speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, which gave us the key to understanding new problems and solving new problems. Now the people of the whole country are enthusiastically studying this speech. Of course, intellectuals and democratic parties need to study it carefully in light of their own life experiences.

I.

The issue of intellectuals is part of the contradictions among the people. It is extremely important to correctly understand and treat intellectuals themselves and the problems that exist in various aspects. Intellectuals master modern science and technology and culture, participate in political, economic, and cultural activities, and are an important force in socialist construction, and there are only five million intellectuals in China's 600 million population. Obviously, today, this precious historical heritage is worth cherishing very much, and the full utilization and full play of their enthusiasm is far from meeting today's needs. However, there are now problems that hinder intellectuals from exerting their enthusiasm and creativity. First of all, intellectuals are greatly influenced by the old society and bourgeois ideology. Although intellectuals have been serving socialism for several years, that is, serving the workers and peasants, and are accelerating their transformation into socialist laborers, and their relationship with the workers and peasants is becoming increasingly close; however, there is still a big difference between intellectuals' mental labor and the physical labor of the workers and peasants. And intellectuals have not yet shed their old sense of superiority. They often forget that their knowledge originates from the experience accumulated by the labor of the working people, and instead, they have a view of belittling physical labor deep in their minds. In their work and life, they often consider problems from their own perspective, detached from the masses and reality. Secondly, the workers and peasants also have feelings of incompatibility with the intellectuals in their lives. In general, society still does not have enough understanding of the valuable experience of human labor inherited by intellectuals, their engagement in mental labor to serve society, and their active learning and desire for progress in recent years; they often emphasize that they used to serve the bourgeoisie and have bourgeois ideological styles. Here, there is a contradiction between the subjective and the objective, and between the workers and peasants and the intellectuals. The specific reflection of this problem is that there are still problems of arrangement, use, and trust between the Communist Party and the intellectuals, and there are phenomena of insufficient coordination in the relationship between leaders and those led. This also hinders the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. On the one hand, there are concerns about not daring to boldly "bloom" and boldly "contend", and on the other hand, there is a situation of not being willing to "bloom" for fear of trouble.

II. Democratic parties have more and more contact with intellectuals, and profound changes are taking place within the organization. New problems are constantly occurring, reflecting some of the contradictions among the people, especially the contradictions related to intellectuals. (1) The problem is political and ideological. It centrally reflects the three ideological situations that exist in the ideological changes of intellectuals advancing towards socialism. One is that they can adhere to the socialist principle and can also proceed from the desire for unity, but their theoretical level is low and their working methods are simplistic. When faced with new situations and new problems, they often show that they have no idea in their minds, and they are not humble and patient enough to study the problems. Second: they are generally positive about the country's socialist construction and are more enthusiastic about the activities of democratic parties. However, when dealing with the relationship between the collective and the individual, and in political activities, they often cannot proceed from reality or from the masses. They are also not easy to adhere to principles on issues of right and wrong. The third is to proceed from the individual, with many grievances, completely push the problems arising in the work aside, do not see the share of responsibility that they should bear, and do not treat comrades from the desire for unity. This attitude essentially not only fails to recognize the new situation, but also has a resistant attitude towards the development of new things. The above three ideas are constantly undergoing complex changes and developments. Although the first type has a small number of people at present, it is gradually improving and developing. The second type has a larger number of people, and the third type is very few. They have different views on the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision", the leadership of the Communist Party, and the equal, free, and independent issues of democratic parties. (2) The problem is in the work. Generally speaking, the work of democratic parties cannot meet the political requirements of the country and the masses, and the leadership methods and styles cannot meet the requirements of practical work. Under the active influence of the United Front Work Department's inspection of united front work last year, more problems in the work were exposed. The National Working Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party criticized the conservative thinking and bureaucracy that existed in the leadership work.

Due to the existence of the above problems, it is natural to sing opposing tunes. Singing opposing tunes is a good thing to promote democracy. Not only should we not be afraid of singing opposing tunes, but we should also welcome singing opposing tunes. Whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, whether it starts from socialism or from individualism, the best way is to let the masses identify it. Today's masses are patriotic and have socialist awareness. People who start from individualism, no matter how good their disguise and performance techniques are, can never hide from the eyes of the masses. The fact that an important debate took place at the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and that the facts of distinguishing right from wrong and enhancing unity after democratic debate are enough to prove that: as long as we proceed from the desire for unity, promote democracy, tell the truth and criticize mistakes in a realistic manner, then the bad things of "ruthless attacks" starting from individualism will also turn into good things, the correct ones will always get the support of the masses, and the minority can also join the side of the majority, and the opposing tunes can also be turned into a chorus. However, there should be a distinction between dealing with ideological problems and dealing with work problems. Work problems should be discussed democratically and realistically, adhere to principles, correct mistakes, and make reasonable decisions by implementing democratic centralism. Naturally, such work decisions cannot be in line with the subjective wishes of everyone. Ideological problems are different. When dealing with each person and each type of ideological problem, we cannot demand that it be solved all at once. We must use the spirit of being kind to others and saving people, and appropriately conduct criticism and assistance, and we must also be good at waiting. Those who have indeed been wronged should be given sympathy; those who have a little bit of progressive performance should be encouraged in a timely manner.

III. In the past ten years, the Chinese Communist Party has led our country through two great historical changes, the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and has embarked on the road of prosperity and strength. In the future, it will continue to lead our country to achieve even greater victories in the new historical period of socialism and communism. However, in the leadership work, it is impossible not to have some shortcomings or errors. The Communist Party has never shied away from shortcomings and errors. On the contrary, the Communist Party attaches the most importance to its own shortcomings and errors. And it is best at listening to the opinions of the masses to correct errors and overcome shortcomings. Now the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to take Chairman Mao's report as the guiding ideology, and take the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the theme, and to re-conduct a universal and in-depth rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in the entire party, that is, in all aspects of the country's leadership work. The main thing is to check the handling of contradictions among the people, and to check the implementation of the Party's policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend", "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision", and "building the country with diligence and thrift". This is a wise and correct decision made by the Chinese Communist Party in the new period of great transformation, and another serious and earnest ideological education movement. This will generate great power for the unity of the people of the whole country and the development of the socialist cause; and it will have a profound impact on the cause of world peace and human progress. Democratic parties and intellectuals, undoubtedly, cannot stand idly by. Every contradiction among the people has two aspects. If there are still "walls" and "ditches" in the relationship between the Party and the masses, then the work of dismantling "walls" and filling "ditches" should be done by both sides. The key to solving the problem lies in the leadership, so first of all, we must boldly offer opinions to the leadership, break all concerns, tell the truth in a realistic manner, put the problems out, and help the Communist Party to carry out the rectification movement and correctly solve the problems. If the main problem in the relationship between the Party and the masses is sectarianism and dogmatism, then we should expose the faults of sectarianism and dogmatism. Different class origins have different class feelings, which is understandable, and it can also be eliminated by increasing mutual understanding from cooperation. However, the serious problem lies in the fact that some Communist Party members are infected with the privileged thinking of the old ruling class, and they often forget the Party's education that requires Party members to be loyal and diligent servants of the people, and they mechanically use the principle of class struggle to cover up their privileged thinking and use the Party's high prestige among the people to exert their privileges. I think we should help the Communist Party to get rid of this privileged thinking through this rectification movement. But on the other hand, democratic parties and intellectuals should reflect on themselves and profoundly understand the great educational significance of the CCP's rectification movement. And we should correctly deal with the contradictions among the people by improving our work and strengthening self-education and self-transformation.

From the perspective of the work of democratic parties, today's work is fundamentally different from the work in the previous period. In the previous period, the main task was to help members and the masses they contacted accept socialist ideological transformation. Today's main task should be to expand the democratic life of socialism. We should further play an active role in contacting the masses, representing the legitimate interests and reasonable opinions of the masses, and participating in state affairs; on the other hand, we should accept the correct leadership of the Communist Party, embody our political requirements, and conduct mutual supervision by consulting and formulating various national policies and implementing the policies, combining the partial interests of the people with the overall interests of the country, and correctly solving the contradictions among the people. In order to transform negative factors into positive factors, so as to accelerate the development of socialism. At the same time, we must vigorously promote democracy within the organization, encourage the emerging progressive forces, and constantly expose and overcome the contradictory problems in the progress. Build ourselves into a socialist political party. Such work is the work of implementing "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision", and requires a thorough change in the leadership methods and working styles. Subjectivism that is detached from reality, bureaucracy that is detached from the masses, and sectarianism that starts from the individual are all serious problems in democratic parties. Therefore, democratic parties must first study the spirit and methods of the Communist Party's rectification, and learn the working style of proceeding from reality and following the mass line. We must always attach importance to and accept the opinions of the masses, especially the criticisms from the bottom up, and strive to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. We must thoroughly change the bad habits of closing the door to come up with ideas, being high above the ground, and not looking down. For the ideological education of intellectuals, the theme of the previous period was the struggle between two roads, requiring to draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism, and requiring to establish the idea of taking the socialist road; today's theme has changed. Today's theme is to correctly understand and treat the contradictions among the people. Therefore, today's requirements are also different. I think: First, we must establish a labor point of view. Intellectuals must recognize that today's reality is the life of working together with the workers and peasants. All knowledge leaves labor and becomes a rootless seedling, and nothing can grow. The combination of mental labor and physical labor can embody the great significance of labor creating the world. Second, we must establish a mass point of view. Everyone must seek life among the masses and labor for the needs of the masses. Intellectuals must go to the masses, learn from the masses, and understand the lives of the masses, especially the lives of the workers and peasants. Third, we must gradually change the old worldview and gradually establish the dialectical materialist worldview. But it must be recognized that the struggle between the two worldviews is fundamentally the ideological struggle between the two classes. Changing the worldview is not easy, and it requires a thorough transformation. If someone does not admit this, then it shows that there are still many problems in ideological transformation. Therefore, we must go further, exercise in practical life, gradually establish a labor point of view and a mass point of view, consciously and voluntarily study Marxism-Leninism, combine with practical problems, and delve into them deeply. At the same time, we ask everyone to strive to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend", carry out free debate, to recognize the truth, spread the truth, and improve the level of thinking, so as to promote the development of science and culture.

    民主党派应该如何对待人民内部矛盾的问题
    中国农工民主党中央委员　李伯球
    我国社会主义制度基本上建立起来以后，正处于一个伟大的新的历史时期。要在阶级斗争胜利的基础上，最广泛地团结各民族、各阶层人民群众，发挥一切积极力量，向自然斗争，不断夺取伟大的胜利。人类社会走过漫长的阶级斗争的历史，对自然斗争也积累了丰富的经验，创造了现代科学文化。但在有阶级的社会里，生产劳动不能不受统治阶级的控制和剥削，生产力的发展不能不受到束缚。只有推翻了剥削阶级的统治，消灭了私有制，建立起社会主义制度，生产力得到彻底解放，才能充分发挥人类劳动智慧，充分利用和不断创造科学技术，并在高度的科学技术基础上充分控制自然，利用自然界无尽的宝藏，不断提高生产来满足人类的需要。我国社会从一个半封建半殖民地的统治下解放出来还不过八年，又取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，跃进到一个新的历史时期。这是一个历史上空前的无与伦比的大变化，社会各方面都发生着错综复杂的深刻的矛盾。主要是人民内部矛盾问题，而矛盾的揭露、问题的解决，是变消极为积极和加速社会主义发展的关键。所以毛主席适时地作了正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，给了我们认识新问题和解决新问题的钥匙。现在全国人民都在热烈学习这个讲话。当然知识分子和民主党派更需要结合自己的生活实践来认真地学习。一
    知识分子问题是人民内部矛盾的一部分。正确认识和对待知识分子本身和对各方面存在的问题，那是极重要的。知识分子掌握了现代科学技术和文化，参加着政治、经济、文化各种活动，是社会主义建设的一支重要的队伍，并且中国六亿人口中，只有五百万知识分子。显然，今天对于这个宝贵的历史遗产，是值得十分珍惜的，而且充分利用和充分发挥他们的积极性，都还远不能适应今天的需要。但是现在却存在妨碍知识分子发挥积极性和创造性的问题。首先是知识分子受旧社会和资产阶级的思想影响较大，几年来知识分子虽然已经是为社会主义服务，也就是为工农服务，正在加速地转化为社会主义的劳动者，同工农群众的关系日益接近；但是知识分子的脑力劳动同工农群众的体力劳动还有很大的差异。并且知识分子还未去掉旧的优越感，他们常常忘记了自己的知识是发源于劳动人民劳动积累的经验，反而在思想深处存在轻视体力劳动的观点。他们在工作上、生活上常常从自己的角度考虑问题，脱离群众，脱离实际。其次，工农群众对知识分子生活感情上也有格格不入的情况。社会上一般对于知识分子继承了人类劳动宝贵经验，从事脑力劳动来为社会服务，几年来积极学习和要求进步方面都还认识不足；对于他们过去为资产阶级服务，有资产阶级思想作风则常常强调。这里就发生主观同客观、工农同知识分子之间的矛盾问题。这种问题具体的反映，就是共产党同知识分子之间还存在安排、使用、信任等等问题，领导同被领导之间的关系上还有不够协调的现象。这样也就妨碍“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的贯彻执行，一方面有不敢大胆“放”、大胆“鸣”的顾虑，另方面有怕出乱子，不肯“放”的情况。二  民主党派同知识分子的联系越来越多，组织内部正在起着深刻的变化，新的问题不断发生，反映着人民内部一部分矛盾，特别是知识分子有关的矛盾问题。（一）是政治思想上的问题，集中地反映着知识分子向社会主义前进的思想变化中，存在三种思想情况，一种是能够坚持社会主义原则，也能从团结的愿望出发，但是理论水平低，工作方法简单化，面临新的情况新的问题往往表现胸中无数，又不够虚心和耐心去研究问题。第二种：对国家的社会主义建设一般是积极的，对民主党派活动也较热心。但是处理集体与个人之间的关系，以及在政治活动中，往往不能从实际出发、从群众出发。在是非问题上也还不容易坚持原则。第三种是从个人出发，有很多不满情绪，把工作中产生的问题完全推到一边，不看见自己应负的一分责任，而且不从团结的愿望出发来对待同志。这种态度实质上不仅没有认识新的形势，并且对于新事物的发展还带着抵触情绪。上述三种思想不断地发生错综的变化和发展，第一种目前虽人数较少，但在逐步提高和发展中，第二种人数较多，第三种则是为数极少的。他们之间对于“长期共存、互相监督”的方针、共产党的领导和民主党派平等自由独立问题即有不同的看法。（二）是工作上的问题，一般说，民主党派工作还不能适应国家和群众的政治要求，领导方法和作风又不能适应实际工作的要求。在统战部去年检查统战工作的积极影响之下，更多地揭露了工作中的问题。农工民主党这次全国工作会议即批评了领导工作中存在的保守思想和官僚主义。
    由于上述问题的存在，自然就不免唱对台戏。唱对台戏正是发扬民主的好事，不仅不要怕唱对台戏，而且要欢迎唱对台戏。好与坏，是与非，究竟是从社会主义出发，还是从个人主义出发，最好的办法是由群众来鉴定。今天的群众是爱国主义的和有社会主义觉悟的群众。从个人主义出发的人无论有怎样好的化装和好的表演手法，总瞒不过群众的眼睛。这次农工民主党三中全会上发生过重要的争论，经过民主辩论，终于分清了是非、增进了团结的事实，就足以证明：只要从团结的愿望出发，发扬民主，实事求是讲清道理、批评错误，那末从个人主义出发的“无情打击”的坏事也会变成好事，正确的总会得到群众的支持，而少数派也能够投向多数的一边，对台戏也可以演成合唱的。但是，从处理思想问题同处理工作问题应该有所区别，工作上的问题是要经过民主的实事求是的讨论，坚持原则，纠正错误，贯彻民主集中制来作出合理的决定。自然这种工作的决定是不可能与每一个人的主观愿望相符合的。思想问题就不同了，对待每个人每一种思想问题，不能要求一下子解决，要用与人为善治病救人的精神，适当地进行批评和帮助，而且还要善于等待。对于某些确实受到委屈的人，应该寄予同情；对于有一点点进步表现的，都要及时鼓励。 三 中国共产党在最近十年间领导着我们国家经历了民主革命和社会主义革命两次伟大的历史变革，走上了繁荣强盛的道路，今后仍然要领导我国在社会主义和共产主义新的历史时期获得更伟大的胜利。但是在领导工作中，不可能不发生一些缺点或错误，共产党从来也没有讳言缺点和错误，相反地，共产党是最重视自己的缺点和错误的。并且它最善于听取群众意见来纠正错误，克服缺点。现在中国共产党中央已决定以毛主席的报告为指导思想，以正确处理人民内部矛盾问题为主题，在全党范围，亦即在国家领导工作的各方面，重新进行一次普遍的、深入的反官僚主义、反宗派主义、反主观主义的整风运动。主要的是检查处理人民内部矛盾问题的情况，检查对于党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针和“勤俭建国”的方针的执行情况。这是中国共产党在大转变的新时期，英明而正确的决定，又一次严肃认真的思想教育运动。这将对于全国人民的团结和社会主义事业的发展发生伟大的力量；并且将对世界和平与人类的进步事业发生深远的影响。民主党派和知识分子，无疑是不能置身事外。人民内部每一个矛盾问题都有两方面因素，如果说，党群关系上还有“墙”和“沟”，那么拆“墙”、填“沟”的工作应由两方面动手。解决问题的关键在于领导，所以首先要大胆向领导提意见，打破一切顾虑，实事求是地说出心里话，把问题摆出来，帮助共产党开展整风运动，正确地解决问题。如果说，党群关系上主要的是宗派主义和教条主义作祟，那么应该揭露宗派主义和教条主义的毛病。不同的阶级出身有不同的阶级感情，那是可以理解的，也是可以从合作共事中相互增加了解来消除隔阂的。但是严重的问题还在于某些共产党员沾染了旧统治阶级的特权思想，往往把党要求党员做人民的忠诚勤务员的教育忘记了，机械地运用阶级斗争的原则，来掩饰自己的特权思想，利用党在人民群众中的崇高威信来发挥他的特权。我认为应该帮助共产党通过这次整风运动反掉这种特权思想。但是另一方面，民主党派和知识分子应该反躬自省，深刻地领会中共整风运动的伟大的教育意义。并且应该通过改进工作和加强自我教育和自我改造来正确对待人民内部矛盾问题。
    从民主党派的工作来说，今天的工作同前一时期的工作，根本上已有所不同。前一个时期，主要的工作是帮助成员和所联系的群众接受社会主义的思想改造。今天的主要工作应该是扩大社会主义的民主生活。在联系群众、代表群众正当利益和合理意见，参加国家事务的活动方面，进一步发挥积极作用；另一方面要通过协商制定国家的各种方针政策和贯彻执行方针政策，来接受共产党的正确领导、体现自己的政治要求和进行互相监督，把部分的人民利益和国家整体的利益结合起来，正确地解决人民内部矛盾问题。从而转变消极的因素为积极的因素，以加速社会主义的发展。同时，要在组织内部大力地发扬民主，鼓舞新生的进步的力量，不断地揭露和克服前进中的矛盾问题。把自己建设成为社会主义的政党。这样的工作，是贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的工作，需要彻底改变领导的方法和工作作风。脱离实际的主观主义、脱离群众的官僚主义、从个人出发的宗派主义的作风，在民主党派里面都是严重存在的。所以民主党派首先要学习共产党整风的精神和方法，学习从实际出发、走群众路线的工作作风。经常重视和接受群众的意见，尤其是自下而上的批评，努力克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义。要把过去关起门来出主意，高高在上，眼睛不往下看的坏作风彻底改变过来。对于知识分子的思想教育来说，前一个时期是以两条道路斗争为主题，要求划清社会主义和资本主义界限，要求树立走社会主义道路的思想；今天的主题改变了。今天是以正确认识和对待人民内部矛盾为主题。所以今天的要求也不同了。我认为：第一，要求树立劳动观点。知识分子必须认识今天的现实生活，是同工农劳动人民共同劳动的生活，一切知识离开了劳动就成为无根之苗，就不能生长什么东西。脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，就可以体现劳动创造世界的伟大意义。第二，要求建立群众观点。每一个人都必须在群众中求生活，为群众的需要而劳动。知识分子要到群众中去，向群众学习，了解群众生活，特别是工农群众的生活。第三，要求逐步改变旧的世界观，逐步树立辩证唯物主义的世界观。但必须认识，两种世界观的斗争，根本上是两个阶级的思想斗争，改变世界观不是容易的事情，需要经过一番脱胎换骨的功夫。如果有人不承认这一点，那么正说明思想改造还存在很多问题。所以必须进一步，从实际生活中锻炼，逐步树立劳动观点和群众观点，自觉自愿地学习马克思列宁主义，结合实际问题，深入钻研。同时要求大家努力贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，开展自由辩论，来认识真理、传播真理，提高思想水平，以促进科学、文化的发展。
