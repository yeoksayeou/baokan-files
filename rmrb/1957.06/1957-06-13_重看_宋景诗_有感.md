Thoughts on Re-watching "Song Jing Shi"
　　Qiu Yun
    I first watched "Song Jing Shi" in the late winter of 1955. Now, re-watching the revised "Song Jing Shi," it is already the early summer of 1957. Although the revisions are not numerous, a full year and a half has passed, and it was re-filmed twice, indicating that the directors and editors went through repeated exploration and put in great effort.

    It cannot be said that the film "Song Jing Shi" had no need for revision at all. The initial draft of the film did have some unsatisfactory aspects. For instance, it was not clearly explained whether Song Jing Shi "negotiated peace" with Sheng Bao or "surrendered" to Sheng Bao. The revised "Song Jing Shi" clarifies this point relatively better. However, because the revision process overemphasized the need for strict criticism of the "surrender," repeatedly forcing Song Jing Shi to make some righteous and stern "self-criticisms" (such self-criticism actually far exceeds the level of understanding of a peasant from a century ago); at the same time, it overly highlighted Song Jing Shi's resourcefulness and heroic tenacity, neglecting his inner contradictions and sorrowful pain. Consequently, the character of Song Jing Shi appears "idealized" and "simplified." As a result, the tragic atmosphere of the film is diluted, and the film's power of infection is weakened.

    All peasant uprisings in history inevitably ended in tragedy, and Song Jing Shi was naturally no exception. To avoid violating historical truth, the failed peasant uprising had to be depicted as a tragedy. Writing tragedy does not equate to spreading pessimistic emotions. As Romain Rolland said in "Vie de Michel-Ange": "We should not only praise joy, but also pain—for both are equally sacred." For this kind, upright, and courageous peasant hero, we should certainly praise his virtues, his joy, his victories. We should not avoid or conceal his mistakes, his pain, or even his failures, as they can also provide us with inspiration and lessons. Song Jing Shi's life experiences deeply attracted us and stirred our resonance and empathy not only because of his outstanding military genius, his intense class hatred, his passion for struggle, and his indomitable courage, but also because of the weaknesses and failures mixed in with these qualities. If this peasant hero had been invincible, always victorious, always smooth sailing, and had encountered no setbacks or failures, if his path had not been so winding, and if his heart had not been filled with contradictions and pain, he might have seemed greater. However, his life's destiny probably would not have been so touching, so deeply moving.

    The revised film, in this respect, not only failed to make up for the shortcomings of the original but further weakened the heavy atmosphere before and after the Black Flag Army's surrender, simplified Song Jing Shi's inner conflicts, and to some extent avoided the complex situation and historical truth (the Black Flag Army was indeed forced to participate in "suppressing bandits" after their surrender, much like the heroes of Liangshan were forced to conquer Fang La, both of which are profound historical tragedies, but the film intentionally avoids this point). And in some instances, it covered up Song Jing Shi's weaknesses. All of these are enough to damage the film's ideological and artistic qualities. Of course, here, we should also understand the filmmakers' difficulties. Under the pressure of dogmatism at the time, in order to prevent the film from being stillborn, they had to compromise, seeking a compromise between artistic truth and the demands of the "critics." Dogmatists cannot understand that for the insurgent peasants of a hundred years ago, surrender was certainly a tragedy, or perhaps a mistake, but it cannot be regarded as an unforgivable sin, especially when they were besieged for more than a month, with exhausted troops and dwindling supplies. A great peasant uprising leader, like Song Jiang, even regarded accepting amnesty and enlistment as the only proper way out, and Zhang Xianzhong also surrendered to the "government army" twice. How could Song Jing Shi completely transcend all limitations of the era and class? If we must demand modern proletarian revolutionary integrity from the ancients, then we must either revise Song Jing Shi's true face in history, or we can only reject the fate of the film "Song Jing Shi."

    For a long time, a theory has prevailed in our literary circles: when writing about heroes, about positive characters, one cannot write about their weaknesses, their wavering, hesitation, distress, and sorrow, nor can one write about the contradictions and conflicts in their character; otherwise, it is "smearing gray on the hero's face" and "distorting the glorious image of positive characters." The "heroic figures" created under the guidance of this theory are, in reality, only idealized "deities" or emotionless "revolutionary machines," and cannot be living, breathing human beings. The directors and editors of "Song Jing Shi," although not completely captured by this theory, were to some extent constrained by it. Therefore, they dared not fully depict Song Jing Shi's inner contradictions and pain, and dared not boldly reveal the tragic significance of this historical event. The film has been repeatedly revised, but it still has not reached a higher, deeper, and more perfect artistic realm. In fairness, the interference of dogmatists is undoubtedly to blame.

    However, it must be said that despite some shortcomings, "Song Jing Shi" is still an excellent historical film. Some scenes in the film are handled very movingly. For example, the scene where Song Jing Shi takes the treasured sword left by his father from his mother and leaves home; the scene where Song Jing Shi stands on the bank of the Yellow River, gazing at his hometown, listening to the soldiers sing慷慨悲歌; the scene where Song Jing Shi bids farewell to his mother and wife on the eve of the Black Flag Army's withdrawal from Xiaoliuguan Village… Passionate audiences, seeing these scenes, probably cannot avoid shedding tears. These scenes are particularly touching precisely because they portray the image of a true person, a true hero, allowing us to see the hero's "human side," and like us, he also has ordinary concerns, conflicting feelings, and sorrow and distress caused by the major misfortunes he has encountered. But even with these spiritual weaknesses, he finally overcame them with his strong will and completed a noble task, becoming a person worthy of the title of "hero." For this, he must constantly engage in self-struggle. The fiercer the struggle, the more it reveals the hero's noble qualities and brilliant personality. Unfortunately, not all other parts of the film fully embody this point.

    Taken as a whole, although the character image of Song Jing Shi is not yet fully rounded, it is basically written relatively realistically and successfully. The film does not portray him as a resourceful "heavenly being," nor does it portray him as a commanding and ambitious famous general. His every move and every word appear very simple and strict, fully in line with the identity of a peasant leader from the masses. For example, when Song Jing Shi dissuades the masses from disbanding, he says to everyone: "We can't disband, if we disband, let alone grain and silver, even our heads will belong to others!" Another example is when Song Jing Shi watches a play after winning a battle and says to his younger brother: "It would be great if Mom could be here!" These dialogues, which seem simple and unimportant, very vividly express the spiritual outlook of this peasant hero. Comrade Cui Wei, who played Song Jing Shi, was also able to appropriately grasp the character's characteristics.

    The film's portrayal of some minor characters also has commendable achievements. For example, Yang Dianyi's heroic bravery, Zhang Chongde's simplicity and straightforwardness, Sheng Bao's cunning and treachery, and Seng Gelinqin's stubbornness and self-willedness… are all vividly portrayed in the film. It is commendable that so many characters are written in a film, and each character has a unique personality, without falling into the clichés of formulaic or conceptual portrayals.

    The film's cinematography also has a unique style. For example, the handling of large-scale war scenes, the depiction of natural scenery, and close-up shots of characters can be considered to have reached a considerable level in domestic films. Another example is the comparison between the Black Flag Army being forced to cross the Yellow River after surrendering and their return to cross the river after the second uprising. The atmosphere of the former scene is heavy, making people feel grief and indignation; the latter scene is bright with sunshine, and the wind flutters the flags, making people feel energetic. The two scenes echo each other, forming a strong contrast. From these scenes, we can see the meticulous craftsmanship of the directors, editors and producers in artistic creation.

### 重看“宋景诗”有感

　　重看“宋景诗”有感
　　秋耘
    我第一次看“宋景诗”，是在1955年的残冬，这回重看修改后的“宋景诗”，已经是1957年的初夏了。修改的地方虽然不多，其间却整整经历了一年又半，而且重拍了两次，可见编导者们是经过反复探索，费了大劲的。
    不能说“宋景诗”这部影片根本没有修改的必要。影片的初稿的确有些不能令人满意的地方，例如宋景诗究竟是跟胜保“讲和”，还是向胜保“投降”，就没有交代清楚。修改后的“宋景诗”，对这一点倒是交代得比较清楚了。但由于在修改过程中过分强调要对“投降”进行严格的批评，一再强使宋景诗作一些义正词严的“自我检讨”（这样的检讨实际上是远超过一个百年前的农民的认识水平的）；同时又过分突出了宋景诗底权谋机智和英勇顽强的一面，忽视了他底内心矛盾和忧伤痛苦的一面，因而就使宋景诗这个人物显得“理想化”和“简单化”了。这样一来，反而冲淡了这部影片的悲剧气氛，也削弱了这部影片的感染力量。
    历史上一切农民起义都不免于悲剧性的结局，宋景诗自然也不能例外；要想不违反历史的真实，就只有把这次失败了的农民起义写成悲剧。写悲剧，并不等于传播悲观主义的情绪。正如罗曼罗兰在“弥盖朗琪罗传”中所说：“我们不能够只赞扬欢乐，痛苦也应该赞扬——因为两者同样是神圣的。”对于这个善良正直而勇于战斗的农民英雄，他底优点，他底欢欣，他底胜利，我们固然应该歌颂。他底错误，他底痛苦，甚至他底失败，我们也不必回避和加以掩饰。因为它们同样也能够给予我们以激励和教训。宋景诗的一生遭遇之所以能够深深地吸引着我们，激起我们的共鸣同感，并不只因为他底卓越的军事天才，他底强烈的阶级仇恨，他底战斗的热情和迈进不屈的勇气，同时也因为混和在这些当中的他底一些弱点和失败。如果这位农民英雄战无不胜，攻无不克，一帆风顺，万事如意，他底事业没有遭遇到挫折和失败，他底道路不是那么迂回曲折，他底内心没有充满着矛盾和痛苦，他也许会显得更伟大些。可是，他底生活命运恐怕就不会这样感人肺腑，这样使人荡气回肠了。
    经过修改后的影片，在这一点上，不但没有能够弥补原作的缺憾，反而更加减弱了黑旗军受降前后的沉重气氛，简化了宋景诗的内心矛盾，在一定程度上回避了复杂的情况和历史的真实（黑旗军受降后确曾被迫参加过“剿回”战役，有如梁山泊的英雄们被迫去征方腊，同样都是深刻的历史悲剧，但影片对这一点是有意回避了的）。而在某些场合，却掩盖了宋景诗的弱点，掩盖了他的弱点。所有这些，都适足以损伤影片的思想性和艺术性。自然，在这里，我们也应该体谅到编导者们的苦衷，当时在教条主义的压力下，为了使这部影片不至胎死腹中，他们也只好委曲求全，在艺术的真实和“批评家”的要求中间寻求一种折衷和妥协。教条主义者不能理解，对于一百年前的起义农民来说，投降固然是悲剧，或者可以说是错误，但决不能看作是不可宽恕的罪恶，特别是当他们被围困了一个多月，兵尽矢穷、人瘦马乏的时候。一个伟大的起义农民领袖，犹如宋公明，尚且把受招安看作唯一的正当的出路，而张献忠也先后两次投降过“官军”，宋景诗又怎能完全超越一切时代的和阶级的局限？如果一定要用现代无产阶级的革命气节苛求于古人，那么，要么就得修改了历史上宋景诗的真面目，要么就只好否决影片“宋景诗”的命运了。
    长久以来，我们文坛上流行着一种理论：写英雄，写正面人物，就不能写他的弱点，不能写他的动摇、彷徨、苦闷和悲伤，不能写他的性格上的矛盾和冲突，否则就是“在英雄的脸上抹灰”，“歪曲了正面人物的光辉形象”。在这种理论指导下创造出来的“英雄人物”，实际上只能是一个理想化了的“神祗”，或者是一部毫无感情的“革命机器”，而不可能是一个活生生的、有血有肉的人。“宋景诗”的编导者们，虽然没有完全为这种理论所俘虏，但在一定程度上也受到这种理论的束缚，因而不敢充分刻划出宋景诗的内心矛盾和痛苦，不敢放胆揭示出这一历史事件的悲剧意义。这部影片经过一再修改，仍然未能达到更高、更深、更完美的艺术境界，说句公道话，教条主义者的干预是难辞其咎的。
    不过，话又得说回来，尽管有着某些美中不足的地方，“宋景诗”毕竟不失为一部优秀的历史影片。影片中有些场面是处理得非常动人的。例如宋景诗从母亲手里接过父亲遗留下来的宝刀，离家出走的场面；宋景诗屹立在黄河边上眺望故乡，听将士们慷慨悲歌的场面；黑旗军撤出小刘贯庄的前夕，宋景诗跟母妻泣别的场面……。热情的观众们，看到这些场面，恐怕都免不了会热泪盈眶的。这些场面之所以特别激动人心，正因为它们表现出一个真正的人、一个真正的英雄的形象，使我们看到英雄底“人的一面”和我们一样，他也有着平凡的牵挂，矛盾的心情，以及由于个人所遭遇的重大不幸而引起的悲伤苦恼。但纵使有这些心灵上的弱点，他终于凭着自己坚强的意志，克服了它们而完成了崇高的任务，成为一个配得上“英雄”称号的人。为了这，他必须经常不断地进行自我斗争。斗争越酷烈，就越能显示出英雄的高贵品质和光辉人格。可惜影片中的其他部分，并不是全都能够充分体现这一点。
    就其整体来看，宋景诗这个人物形象虽然还不够十分丰满，但基本上是写得比较真实、比较成功的。影片并没有把他渲染成一个神机妙算的“天人”，也没有把他写成一个叱咤风云、雄才大略的名将，他的一举一动、一言一语都显得非常淳朴谨严，完全符合于一个来自群众中的农民领袖的身份。例如写宋景诗在劝止群众散伙时，对大家说：“咱们散不得，散了别说粮食、银子，脑袋都是人家的！”又如写宋景诗在打了胜仗后，边看戏边对弟弟说：“娘要是能在这儿，那多好啊！”等等这些看来似乎是很简单的对话，是无关重要的小动作，却很传神地表达出这个农民英雄的精神面貌。扮演宋景诗的崔嵬同志，也能够恰如其分地掌握到这个人物的性格特征。
    影片对于一些次要人物的塑造，也有值得称道的成就。例如杨殿乙的豪迈英勇，张崇德的质朴耿直，胜保的狡猾阴险，僧格林沁的刚愎自用，……在影片中都表现得活灵活现，有声有色。在一部影片中写了这么多的人物，而每个人物都有独特的性格，不落入公式化、概念化的窠臼，这是难能可贵的。
    影片的摄影艺术也具有独特的风格。如对于大规模战争场面的处理，自然景色的描写，人物的特写镜头，在国产片中，可算达到相当高度的水平。又如黑旗军受降后被迫渡黄河与二次起义后回师渡河的对比，前一个场面气氛沉重，使人悲愤；后一个场面阳光明丽，大风拂旗，使人神旺。前后呼应，形成强烈的对照。从这些场面，可以看出编导者和摄制者们在艺术创作上精雕细琢的匠心。
