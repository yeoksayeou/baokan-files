　　Water Oilseed Rape

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu -- Recently, staff members of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture brought back several rare oil crops from Qingchuan County, called water oilseed rape (also known as river oilseed rape).

    Water oilseed rape is sown on waterlogged land on both sides of river ditches or streams where no other crops grow. It can flower and bear seeds without fertilization, hoeing, or weeding. Because it is tolerant of moisture, the closer it is to the water's edge, the better it grows. According to the results of harvesting by farmers in Qingchuan County, generally, water oilseed rape can yield 100 to 120 jin of oilseed per mu, which is 20 to 30 jin more than the local oilseed rape planted in the fields.

    Water oilseed rape has been cultivated in Qingchuan County for more than ten years. Currently, it is planted in six townships, including Dayuan and Maoba. Every year in August, farmers sow the seeds when the river water recedes, and harvest them before the flood arrives in May of the following year. The growing period is relatively long, ranging from 260 to 270 days. A local folk song says: "A handful of seeds are sown into the ditch, planted in August and harvested in May; using the river ditches to plant seeds, ensuring increased production and more oil."

　　水油菜
    据新华社成都电　最近，四川省农业厅工作人员从青川县带回几株稀奇的油料作物，叫做水油菜（又叫河油菜）。
    水油菜播种在不长其它农作物的河沟或溪流两侧的渍地上，不用施肥和中耕除草，就能开花结子。由于它能耐湿，愈靠近水边，生长就愈好。根据青川县农民收获的结果，一般水油菜每亩可收油菜子一百斤到一百二十斤，比当地种在田地上的油菜多收二、三十斤。
    水油菜在青川县已有十几年的栽培历史。现在种植地区有大院、毛坝等六个乡。每年八月间，农民们趁河水枯落时播种，到第二年五月洪水来临前收获。生长期较长，有两百六十天到两百七十天。当地农民编的歌子说：“一把菜子撒进沟，八月种来五月收；利用河沟种菜子，保证增产多打油。”
