Title: Fragrant Flower or Poisonous Weed? - Excerpts from a Speech by Zhang Yuanshan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Director of the Industry and Commerce Research Committee, at a Symposium on Guiding the Transformation of Industry and Commerce convened by the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association

On the evening of May 31st, Comrade Zhang Naiqi once again "unleashed" among us. I may have prejudices, and may even be an incurable dogmatist, but I frankly say that what he "unleashed" was a poisonous weed.

It is poisonous because he wants people to learn from his so-called rigidity. He said that capitalists, in order to get rich, are good at appreciating his talent; that he used to clash with managers but was constantly promoted. He also said that he is much softer today. What does this short paragraph mean? I think he is either complaining about not being appreciated, that others are not as discerning as the capitalists, and that rigidity is useless; or he is complaining that his rigidity has met its match today, that he cannot overcome them and has retreated knowing the difficulty; or he is gloating: that he has been rigid enough, and it is better to soften up. These understandings may be completely wrong and not at all what Comrade Naiqi meant. But in terms of objective effects, his words will have an impact on some industrialists and businessmen if they are spread. Some people will say, "That's right, we are wealth. Why not use Zhang Naiqi's kind of rigidity and boldly clash, which might bring benefits?" Today, when the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen are striving for self-transformation and are making rapid progress, I cannot see how much benefit his words can bring. On the contrary, I think they contain toxins.

It is poisonous because he negates the effect of transformation and denies the realistic significance of transformation. He opened his mouth and said, "I heard that this meeting is going well, because everyone is telling the truth." At first hearing, it seems that everyone was telling lies in the past. This is consistent with his consistent style. He has always portrayed himself as the only confidant of industrialists and businessmen, "I have a common language with you, we are in sync," only he knows the innermost thoughts of industrialists and businessmen. The Communist Party wants to transform the bourgeois elements, and only he shows sympathy to them. This stance has earned him a "market," and he is proud of having this "market" to this day.

As everyone knows, today everyone has raised many opinions to the Party in order to help the Party rectify its work, and the motive is to support the Party. However, he underestimates this motive of industrialists and businessmen, and is still using the method of winning a "market" to entice some people to retreat from the road of progress.

I cannot smell the fragrance of flowers from his words. His last question made me feel confused all night. As his speech was coming to an end, he prominently raised the question: Should theory serve the revolution, or should the revolution serve theory? His way of asking the question really led me astray. Later, I thought about it and felt that his statement was not very fragrant, and might even be very poisonous. Theory is the guide to action, and Marxist theory is the guide to the socialist revolution. Without this theory, politicians can do anything, but it will not be socialism. We are building a socialist society, and our actions are guided by Marxist theory. In this way, theory serves the revolution, so what is there to doubt? But for Comrade Naiqi, this point is still questionable. He curses dogmatists, emphasizes the particularity of the Chinese revolution, and wants to create his own revolutionary theory. In this way, in his view, it is not dogmatism, and theory serves the revolution, not the revolution serving theory. The "Reference News" on June 1st carried an argument, the gist of which was: The great socialist thinker Marx wrote his works a hundred years ago, and at that time there was no place with real democracy, so these works are not applicable to today's situation. There is no immutable way to introduce socialism. I think this is somewhat similar to Comrade Naiqi's view. Is this the case? Of course, further study is needed. If I unfortunately guess correctly, then it will be terrible, very poisonous. I recklessly raise this question to ask Comrade Naiqi for advice, and I ask comrades to correct me.

    香花乎？毒草乎？
    ——民主建国会中央常务委员兼工商研究委员会主任委员章元善在民建中央召开的工商改造辅导工作座谈会上的发言摘要
    5月31日晚上章乃器同志在我们中间又放了一番。我可能有成见，甚至是一个不可救药的教条主义者，但我坦白地说，他放的是毒草。
    毒在他要人向他的所谓刚性学习。他说，资本家为了发财，善于赏识他的才华；他从前冲撞经理，不断得到提拔。他又说他今天是软得多了。短短的几句话，什么意思呢？我想，他或者是为了怀才不遇，别人不如资本家识货，刚亦无用而发牢骚；或者他在埋怨他的刚今天碰到了对头，刚不过人家，知难而退了；或者他沾沾自喜：刚得差不多了，还是软下来吧。这些体会可能一无是处，完全不是乃器同志的本意。但从客观效果来说，他这话如果传播开来，对某些工商业者是会有影响的。有的人会说：“对了，我们是财富。为什么不使章乃器式的刚性，大胆冲撞一番，这倒说不定可以得到便宜？”在广大工商业者正在努力自我改造而且正在迅速前进中的今天，他这一句话的影响有多大益处，我是看不到的。相反，我认为是含有毒素的。
    毒在他抹煞改造的效果，否定改造的现实意义。他一开口就说：“听说这次会开得好，好在大家说真话。”骤然听来，好像以往大家说的都是假的。这与他一贯的作风是一致的。他素来就把自己扮成工商业者的唯一知心朋友，“我与你们有共同语言，心心相印”，只有他知道工商业者的心灵深处。共产党要改造资产阶级分子，只有他是对他们表示同情的。他这立场为自己博得一个“市场”，而且，他为了享有这个“市场”而自豪到今天。
    大家知道，今天大家对党提了不少意见，为的是帮助党整风，其动机是对党的拥护。他却低估了工商业者这个动机，还在用争取“市场”的手法逗引一部分人从前进的道路上倒退回来。
    我从他的一席话中闻不到花香。他临末了的一个问题，更使我模糊了一夜。他在讲话快结束时突出地提出这样一个问题：还是理论为革命服务呢？还是革命为理论服务呢？他这样提问题，确实把我推进迷途。后来想想，我觉得他这提法也不太香，而且可能毒得很。理论是行动的指南，马克思主义理论是社会主义革命的指南，离开了这个理论，政治家们搞什么都可以，就不会是社会主义。我们在建设社会主义社会，指导我们行动的是马克思主义理论。这样说来，理论是为革命服务，这还有什么可疑呢？但是在乃器同志，这点还是值得可疑的。他咒咀教条主义者，强调中国革命的特殊性，要从而创造出一套自己的革命理论来。这样，在他看来才算不是教条主义，才算理论服务于革命，而不是革命服务于理论。6月1日的“参考消息”上载有一种论调，其大意是：伟大的社会主义思想家马克思是在一百年以前写他的著作的，那时候没有一个地方有真正的民主，这些著作不适用于今天的情况。介绍社会主义并没有一成不变的方式。我看这一点与乃器同志倒有点异曲同工之处。是否如此？当然还要详细研究。万一我不幸而言中，那就糟得很了，毒得很了。我肆无忌惮地把这疑问提出来，向乃器同志请教，并请同志们指正。
