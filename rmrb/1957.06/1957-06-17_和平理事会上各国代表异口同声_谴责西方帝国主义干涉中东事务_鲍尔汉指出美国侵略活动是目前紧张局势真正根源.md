Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 16th: Israeli Member of Parliament Wilner put forward the preconditions for holding negotiations to resolve the Middle East issue at the World Peace Council meeting on the morning of June 15th.

The preconditions he mentioned were: opposing imperialist interference in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern people and the establishment of military blocs with foreign participation; opposing the Eisenhower Doctrine, which is the main source of tension in the Middle East—this is currently the main obstacle to resolving Arab-Israeli disputes, and these disputes are being exploited by imperialist elements.

At the World Peace Council's sixth day of meetings, Wilner said: "I believe that if Israel takes the path of anti-colonialism, it will be able to have a common language with the people of Arab countries, and it will be able to find fair and mutually agreed solutions to all disputes between Israel and Arab countries."

Wilner believes that the Soviet Union's proposal to eliminate foreign interference in the Middle East and to resolve all Middle East issues peacefully on the basis of the joint efforts of the four major powers in the United Nations Security Council can serve as a basis for solving the difficult problems in the Middle East.

Wilner pointed out that the purpose of the Eisenhower Doctrine is "to thwart the just struggle of the Arab people against imperialism." He said: "The Eisenhower Doctrine endangers peace in the Middle East, and opposing the Eisenhower Doctrine is in the common interest of the Arab and Israeli people."

Wilner's speech was warmly welcomed.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 16th: Representatives of various countries at the World Peace Council strongly condemned Western imperialists for interfering in the Middle East during the discussion on the Middle East issue, and expressed their support for the Arab people's struggle for independence.

Burhan, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation and Chairman of the China Islamic Association, read out the resolution passed at the recent Peace Conference in Beijing at the plenary meeting on June 15th, and paid special tribute to the people of Egypt, guaranteeing support for Egypt's struggle against armed aggression. At this moment, a storm of applause erupted in the conference hall.

Burhan said that the aggressive activities of the United States, which endanger the national independence, security, and world peace of many countries, are the "real root of the current global tensions."

He said that the reason why the Israeli government still dares to engage in sinful activities to this day is entirely due to the support of imperialism. In reality, under the guise of the Eisenhower Doctrine, imperialists are creating new tensions in the Near and Middle East under the absurd excuse of filling a vacuum.

Burhan said that international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means. In order to resolve the disputes in the Near and Middle East, "all the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the relevant resolutions passed by the United Nations in the past must be strictly observed by the parties concerned."

As Burhan stepped down from the podium, Arab representatives rushed forward to embrace and kiss him.

Yahya Hammoudeh of Jordan said that the Jordanian people repelled the conspiracy to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact, but became a victim of the United States' dirty new conspiracy known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. The Jordanian people are determined to continue their struggle against the Eisenhower Doctrine until final victory is achieved.

Iraqi representative Sharif said that Baghdad was historically called the "Home of Peace," but the forces of autocracy and imperialism tainted the name of Baghdad because they used this name to name the aggressive Baghdad Pact.

The famous Indian peace leader, Sundarlal, said that the Eisenhower Doctrine's conspiracy in Jordan to fill the power vacuum and the activities to divide the Arabs are a new form of the old slogan 'Asians fight Asians'."

On the Hungarian issue, Sundarlal said, we Indians firmly believe that the Soviet Union's timely actions in Hungary saved world peace.

Sundarlal also expressed strong support for the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations.

　　和平理事会上各国代表异口同声
　　谴责西方帝国主义干涉中东事务
　　鲍尔汉指出美国侵略活动是目前紧张局势真正根源
    据新华社科伦坡16日电　以色列议员维尔纳6月15日上午在世界和平理事会会议上，提出了举行解决中东问题的谈判的先决条件。
    他所说的先决条件就是：反对帝国主义干涉中东人民的内部事务和建立有外国参加的军事集团；反对作为中东紧张局势主要根源的艾森豪威尔主义——这是目前妨碍阿拉伯—以色列纠纷获得解决的主要原因，而这种纠纷正为帝国主义分子所利用。
    维尔纳在世界和平理事会第六天的会议上说：“我认为，如果以色列走反殖民主义的道路，它跟阿拉伯各国人民就能够有共同的语言，而且能够找到解决以色列和阿拉伯国家之间一切争端的公正的一致同意的办法。”
    维尔纳认为，苏联关于消除外国对中东的干涉和在联合国安全理事会四大国共同努力的基础上用和平方式解决一切中东问题的建议，可以作为解决中东困难问题的基础。
    维尔纳指出，艾森豪威尔主义的目的是“要挫败阿拉伯各国人民的反帝国主义的正义斗争”。他说：“艾森豪威尔主义危害中东和平，反对艾森豪威尔主义是符合阿拉伯和以色列人民的共同利益的。”
    维尔纳的发言受到热烈的欢迎。
    据新华社科伦坡16日电　世界和平理事会各国代表们在关于中东问题的讨论中强烈谴责西方帝国主义者干涉中东，并表示支持阿拉伯人民的独立斗争。
    中国代表团副团长、中国伊斯兰协会主席鲍尔汉6月15日在全体会议上宣读了北京最近召开的和平大会上通过的决议，并且特别向埃及人民致敬，保证支持埃及反对武装侵略的斗争。这时，会议大厅中响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    鲍尔汉说，美国危害许多国家的民族独立、安全和世界和平的侵略活动，是“目前全世界紧张局势的真正根源”。
    他说，以色列政府所以到现在还敢进行罪恶勾当，完全是由于帝国主义的支持。实际上帝国主义者正在艾森豪威尔主义的幌子下，以填补真空这种荒谬的借口在中近东制造着新的紧张局势。
    鲍尔汉说，国际争端应该用和平方法来解决。为了解决中近东的争端，“万隆会议的全部决议和联合国过去通过的有关决议必须得到有关方面的严格遵守”。
    鲍尔汉在走下讲台的时候，阿拉伯代表们纷纷拥上前去拥抱他吻他。
    约旦的雅希亚·哈穆德说，约旦人民打退了想把约旦拖进巴格达条约的阴谋，但是成了名为艾森豪威尔主义的美国肮脏的新阴谋的牺牲品。约旦人民决心继续把他们反对艾森豪威尔主义的斗争进行到获得最后胜利为止。
    伊拉克代表沙里夫说，巴格达在历史上称为“和平之家”，但是，专制和帝国主义的势力沾污了巴格达的名字，因为它们用这个名字来命名侵略性的巴格达条约。
    印度著名和平领袖森德拉尔说，填补势力真空的艾森豪威尔主义在约旦进行的阴谋和分裂阿拉伯人的活动，是‘亚洲人打亚洲人’这个旧口号的新形式”。
    在匈牙利问题上，森德拉尔说，我们印度人深信，苏联在匈牙利的及时的行动拯救了世界和平。
    森德拉尔还表示坚决支持恢复中国在联合国中国的席位。
