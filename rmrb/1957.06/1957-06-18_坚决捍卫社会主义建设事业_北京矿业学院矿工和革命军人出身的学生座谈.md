　　Resolutely Defend the Cause of Socialist Construction
    Symposium of Students from Worker and Revolutionary Soldier Backgrounds at Beijing Mining Institute
    (Our Newspaper) Students from worker and revolutionary soldier backgrounds at Beijing Mining Institute, after seeing the anti-socialist remarks of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others, held separate gatherings. Many people at the meetings angrily criticized the fallacies of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others.
    Lu Shoumin said that Ge Peiqi claimed that the system of state purchase and supply had been messed up. This is blatant nonsense. The system of state purchase and supply severed the ties between urban and rural capitalism, powerfully promoting the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the development of agricultural cooperation. Can this be said to have been messed up? It wasn't messed up, it was done very well. He angrily refuted Ge Peiqi's erroneous remarks that the people's living standards had declined. Cheng Jitian said that Chu Anping deserves attention. He heard that he is the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, and he wants to use the opportunity of the rectification campaign to oppose socialism, which will not work. He continued, "Please, people like Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi, go to the factories, go to the mines, go to the countryside and see what kind of answers the workers and peasants will give them? Their fallacies will be shattered by the facts."
    The students cited many facts to show that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be traitors like Duan Qirui, Yuan Shikai, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek. Wang Rennong said, "I am a former sailor who defended the territorial waters of the motherland. I personally saw that the traitorous government left many 'souvenirs' beside the ocean of the motherland, namely the 'victory monuments' erected by the imperialists. I personally destroyed these 'souvenirs.' Ge Peiqi said that without the leadership of the Communist Party, no one would betray the country. I don't think so. Who signed the Twenty-One Demands and the Tanggu Truce? Who sold the Qingdao and Weihaiwei naval ports to the imperialists? Who allowed imperialist warships to run rampant in the oceans of the motherland? The Communist Party led the Chinese people to drive out the imperialists, abolish the unequal treaties, and establish the People's Republic of China. Without the Communist Party, would China have today's socialist construction?" Liu Bin said, "In the past, Shanghai was full of imperialist concessions, and the park gates were marked 'Dogs and Chinese not allowed.' Now, these concessions have been taken back, the park is the people's park, and no one dares to treat Chinese people like dogs. Ge Peiqi's statement is an attempt to bring back Chiang Kai-shek and the imperialists to run amok in China and slaughter the Chinese people."

　　坚决捍卫社会主义建设事业
    北京矿业学院矿工和革命军人出身的学生座谈
    本报讯　北京矿业学院矿工出身和革命军人出身的学生们看到葛佩琦、储安平等人反对社会主义的言论，分别举行了集会。许多人在会上愤怒地批评了葛佩琦、储安平等人的谬论。
    鹿守敏说，葛佩琦说统购统销搞糟了。这是闭着眼说瞎话。统购统销斩断了城乡资本主义的联系，有力地推动了资本主义工商业的改造和农业合作化的发展。这能说是搞糟了吗？不是搞糟了，而是搞得很好。他愤怒地驳斥了葛佩琦说人民生活降低的错误言论。程继唐说，值得注意的是储安平，听说他是光明日报的总编辑，他想借整风的机会来反对社会主义，那是不成的。他接着说，请储安平、葛佩琦之流的人物，到工厂里去看看，到矿山里去看看，到农村里去看看，工人和农民会给他们什么样的回答？他们的谬论是会被事实粉碎的。
    学生们列举出许多事实来说明没有共产党的领导，就会出现像段祺瑞、袁世凯、汪精卫、蒋介石这类的卖国贼。王仁农说，我是一个曾经保卫祖国领海的水兵。我亲眼看到过，卖国政府在祖国的海洋旁边留下了不少的“纪念品”，那就是帝国主义者立下的“战胜纪念碑”。我曾亲手摧毁了这些“纪念品”。葛佩琦说不要共产党的领导，人家也不会卖国。我看不见得，二十一条、塘沽协定是谁签定的？青岛、威海卫军港是谁出卖给帝国主义的？是谁允许帝国主义的军舰在祖国的海洋上横冲直闯？共产党领导中国人民赶走了帝国主义，废除了不平等条约，建立了中华人民共和国。没有共产党，中国会有今天的社会主义建设吗？刘斌说，上海过去尽是帝国主义的租界，公园门口写着“禁止狗和华人入内”。现在，这些租界收回了，公园是人民的公园了，谁也不敢把中国人和狗一样看待了。葛佩琦的说法，是想让蒋介石回来，让帝国主义回来，在中国横行霸道，屠杀中国人民。
