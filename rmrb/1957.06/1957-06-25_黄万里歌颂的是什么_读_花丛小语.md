What is Huang Wanli Praising?
——Reading “Small Talk Among the Flowers”

After reading “Small Talk Among the Flowers,” one feels that the author of the article lacks Chinese morality!

This article uses a section of a road in the Western Suburbs that has become muddy as an introduction. Originally, the government repairing the road should be considered a good thing, but in the eyes of Professor Huang, who is filled with malice, it has become an act that should be cursed. Therefore, he disregards the decorum of a university professor and uses the skills of a gossiping old woman to curse "bastards" again and again. It can be seen how much deep-seated hatred he has for the People's Government!

Huang Wanli's hatred for the Party and the People's Government is mainly not about the muddy road. This can be seen from the poem at the beginning of his novel. The first half of this poem maliciously distorts reality, saying that there is no freedom of speech in today's society, as if he has a flower that monopolizes the early spring, "green shoots on the branches," but cannot bloom because of the "chilly spring and mournful rain." Therefore, he can only "remain quietly, with words cut off!" The second half suddenly becomes cheerful, saying that some kind of wind has blown in, blowing away some "foul atmosphere" until it "vanishes into smoke." Therefore, "good birds are in the midst of hundreds of flowers, drumming up their reed tongues" to sing. This clearly refers to the start of the rectification campaign, with right-wing elements releasing anti-socialist opinions in a big way. He is cheering and praising the right-wing elements, echoing them! But the author deliberately, through the mouth of his supposed "Zhen Wuji," says that this is praising the new society, and therefore uses this as an opportunity to launch an even more vicious attack on the Party and the people in the second half of the article. This kind of despicable trickery cannot deceive the readers. If you don't believe it, look at how the article immediately creates two new terms, "Ode-ists" (referring to those who sing praises) and "Dante-ists" (referring to those who are close to the Party), and ruthlessly disparages and smears those intellectuals with a sense of justice who are willing to speak fairly, and those intellectuals who are willing to be close to the Party, scolding them as "the most shameless," scolding them as "either slaves or coffins (officials)," scolding Chinese scholars for "abandoning the truth they recognize and trying their best to get close to the organization," and scolding the people as "Adou" and the Party leadership as people whose "brains are considered clever." This intention is extremely sinister and vicious. He wants to use these slanders and insults to sow discord between intellectuals and the Party, to divide the middle forces. He thinks that after this scolding, intellectuals will no longer dare to get close to the Party. This is a planned conspiracy of the right-wing elements to instigate division, and this point is also exposed in this Professor Huang.

What is strange is that after Mr. Huang has scolded the Chinese people enough, he cannot help but praise American democracy. He says that "If such a thing happened in the United States, the taxpayers would stand up and shout, the bureau chief and chief engineer would not be able to stay in their positions, and the mayor would have difficulty in the next election," and so on. In Mr. Huang's words, it seems that American democracy and freedom are a world model, and America is simply not like a dictatorship by the monopoly bourgeoisie. Is Mr. Huang really so forgetful that he has not seen the unbridled activities of the American Ku Klux Klan, the arbitrary arrests by the Un-American Activities Committee, and the tragic electrocution of the Rosenbergs on trumped-up charges? What is the effect of the American people's shouting? Is this what you call "democracy"? Mr. Huang scolds scholars who praise the motherland as shameless. May I ask, Mr. Huang, as a Chinese university professor, after insulting the Chinese people, you wholeheartedly praise American bourgeois politics. Is this considered shameful?

Here, I would also like to imitate the structure of Mr. Huang's article and, at the end, offer three suggestions to our respected Professor Huang: First, the Chinese people must resolutely defend the fruits of the revolution – the socialist system – achieved through a hundred years of bloodshed and sacrifice, and will never allow any conspirators to infringe upon it; second, if Mr. Huang has a special preference for the American way of life, you are free to go to America to find your like-minded friends, and we will not interfere; third, we are launching a powerful counterattack against your rampant anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist attacks. Your attempt to divide and disintegrate the unity of the Chinese people will not succeed. We will be even more united around the Party to smash your attacks.

### 黄万里歌颂的是什么——读“花丛小语”

　　黄万里歌颂的是什么
　　——读“花丛小语”
    读罢“花丛小语”，使人感到文章的作者很缺少中国人的道德！
    这篇文章，是抓住西郊一段马路翻浆作引子的。本来，政府翻修马路，应该说是一件好事，但在含有满腔恶意的黄教授眼里看来，却成了应该咒骂的行为了，所以他就顾不得大学教授的体面，竟拿出王婆骂街的本领，肆无忌惮地大骂“王八蛋”者至再至三。可见他对人民政府有多大的深仇宿怨！
    黄万里对党对人民政府的仇恨，主要的并不在马路翻浆，这从他小说前面的一首词里，就可以看得出来。这首词的前半段，恶意地歪曲说，在今天的社会里没有言论自由，好像说他虽然有一枝独占早春的“绿尽枝头蘖”的花朵，却因“春寒料峭，雨声凄切”的环境而放不出来，所以只得“静悄悄，微言绝”了！后半段忽然兴高彩烈起来，说是从那儿刮来了一阵什么风，把一些“乌烟瘴气”的事，吹得“烟销烬灭”。所以“好鸟就在百花丛里，鼓起了笙簧舌”地歌唱起来，这明明指的是整风开始，右派分子大放出反社会主义的言论，他在替右派分子欢呼赞扬，互相呼应！但著者却故意在自己假托的“甄无忌”口中，说这是替新社会歌功颂德，因而借此在文章的后半段来掀起向党向人民更恶毒的进攻。这种可耻的鬼蜮伎俩，是迷惑不了读者的，不信我们看文章紧接着就创造了两个“歌德派”（指歌功颂德）、“但丁派”（指靠近党的）的新名词，把一般有正义感、愿说公道话的知识分子，和愿靠近党的知识分子，加以无情的诋毁和污蔑，骂他们是“最为无耻”，骂他们“不是奴才便是棺材（官才）”，骂中国学者“舍弃了自己认识到的真理竭力来靠拢组织”，并把人民骂成“阿斗”把党的领导骂成“脑袋被认为是灵的”人。这个用意，是十分阴险毒辣的，他想在这些诋毁和辱骂中，来挑拨离间知识分子和党的团结，来分化中间力量，他以为这样一骂，知识分子就不敢再向党靠拢了。这是右派分子有计划的挑拨阴谋，在这位黄教授身上，也暴露了这点。
    奇怪的是黄先生在骂够了中国人之后，却紧接着情不自禁地歌颂起美国的民主来了。说“美国真有这样事，纳税人民就要起来叫喊，局长、总工程师就当不成，市长下度竞选也有困难”云云。在黄先生言下，好像美国的民主自由，堪称世界模范，美国简直就不像垄断资产阶级在专政似的。难道黄先生就如此健忘，真的没看到美国三K党的横行无忌，非美活动委员会的随便捕人，卢森堡夫妇以莫须有罪名惨遭电刑吗？美国人民叫喊的效果何在？这就是“民主”云乎哉？黄先生骂歌颂祖国的学者是无耻，请问，黄先生以中国大学教授的身分，在辱骂了中国人之后，却尽情来歌颂美国的资产阶级政治，这难道算是有耻吗？
    在这里，我也要仿照黄先生文章的结构，在末了向我们尊敬的教授先生提出三点建议：一、中国人民要坚决保卫百年来流血牺牲所取得的革命果实——社会主义制度，绝不允许任何阴谋分子来侵犯；二、黄先生假使特别癖好美国生活方式的话，你却有跑到美国去找你同好的自由，我们不会干涉；三、你们反党、反人民、反社会主义的猖狂进攻，我们正在作有力的回击，你想来分化瓦解中国人民的团结，这是作不到的，我们将更加团结在党的周围，来粉碎你们的进攻。
