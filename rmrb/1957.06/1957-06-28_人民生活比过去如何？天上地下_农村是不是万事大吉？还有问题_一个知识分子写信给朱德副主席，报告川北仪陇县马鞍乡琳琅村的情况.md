To the Respected Vice Chairman Zhu:

I work at the Chongqing People's Publishing House Editorial Department. In mid-April, I came to Linlang Cooperative, Ma'an Township, Yilong County to experience life, staying in your old residence. I will soon return to Chongqing, and now I am reporting to you what I have seen and heard in Yilong.

Departing from Chongqing, passing through Beibei (a beautiful garden), Hechuan (the granary of northern Sichuan), Nanchong (the silk city of the celestial kingdom), and Nanbu (the salt field of northern Sichuan), I took a car for two full days to reach Yilong County. What first caught my eye was the nine-story white pagoda, followed by Jinchengzhai and Jincheng Park. Yilong County is built on the mountainside, the city walls have been torn down, and there are only three streets in the city, in a T-shape. Two highways pass through the city, one leading to Bazhong and Nanjiang, and the other to Ma'an market. New buildings in the city include a hospital, a theater, a middle school, a bus station, and office dormitories. The streets are wider than before, but many of the houses are still the same. There are electric lights, a small thermal power plant, and running water in the city. The old folks say: "In the past, in Yilong, dogs bit people at the market, the streets were narrow, there were few people, and it was cold and deserted; you had to carry lanterns even during the day (it was too dark)." "Now, in Yilong, people are crowded at the market, the streets are wide, there are many people, it's lively, and the world is bright."

Yilong to Ma'an is thirty-seven kilometers. The old street of Ma'an market is still the same, unchanged. On the stone pillars in the street, there are slogans carved by the Red Ninth Army in 1933, which are still faintly discernible: "Support the Chinese Communist Party!" "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" "Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry!" "Made by the Political Department of the Red Ninth Army." The former Soviet office, "Wenchang Palace," is now the Party Committee and the People's Committee of the district.

At the entrance of Ma'an market, a new street is being formed, and the newly built health center, granary, and supply and marketing cooperative are all at the head of the market. Nearby, a Ma'an Middle School has also been established.

Below Linlangzhai is Linlang Village, where green pines and cypresses grow and green shade lines the road. There is a primary school at the foot of the village, which now has more than ninety students. It is said that this used to be a private school, where you, old man, studied. Now, the children cherish every plant and tree here.

The people here, like the people all over the motherland, are advancing on the socialist road under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party.

The people's lives are like heaven and earth compared to the past. The days of half a year of grain made up of bran and wild herbs are gone forever. Now every family truly has enough food and clothing.

The farmers here are particularly diligent and thrifty. There are many elderly people who live long lives, such as Zhu Shibi, Zhu Shilu, Zhu Shiyi, Zhu Daiwen, etc., all of whom are over seventy years old. Zhu Daiwen is seventy-four years old and still did more than one hundred workdays in the cooperative last year. He is still very healthy. When I learned to dig soil from him, I still couldn't beat him. The other day, when planting the land, he carried soil manure, more than a hundred pounds at a time. I was very surprised, but the villagers thought it was normal. He is truly a typical old farmer, wearing a faded blue cloth shirt, barefoot, wearing straw sandals, always smiling from morning till night, and loves to tell stories of the past few decades. His sons and grandsons all work in the government. Someone asked him: "Old man, why don't you rest and enjoy yourself!" He said: "I get upset if I don't work! Aren't Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in their sixties or seventies? They are still working! Isn't it all for socialism? How can I be lazy!" That's how he is, he can't stand being idle for even a day. When he works in the cooperative, he is serious and responsible. One day, when planting peanuts, I helped him drop the seeds, and he covered the soil. He saw that a woman in front of him was not paying attention to quality and dug the holes too shallow, and he immediately criticized her. I think people like Zhu Daiwen are role models in the cooperative and the most precious wealth, and they should be respected very well. However, now some rural cadres have prejudices in their minds, thinking that "all old people are conservative and backward," and do not value old people, do not approach old people, and only focus on young people all day long, do not consult with old people, and often take wrong paths in production.

Ninety percent of the rural cadres in Yilong are hardworking and simple. There is a district committee secretary named Wang Silong who lives with me. He used to be the deputy director of the county party committee's organization department. In April, when cadres were sent down to the countryside, he volunteered to go to the countryside and is now also the deputy director of Linlang Cooperative. He used to be a middle school student, and now he is determined to learn how to farm. He does everything himself, from transplanting seedlings in the fields to planting peanuts and cotton on the slopes, learning from the farmers. There is also a Comrade Li, who comes from a peasant background and is now the district production committee member. He studies every day how to improve labor organization and has come up with many methods for the cooperative members. Therefore, the farmers in the whole township call him "Li the Contractor," saying that he is good at solving contracting problems. As for his real name, no one calls him that; "Li the Contractor" is very famous. There is also a Comrade Wang from the statistics section, a middle school student, who went to the countryside to do statistics and also help the agricultural cooperative. He has a wish to invent a new farm tool or improve a crop. He is very enthusiastic and eager to change the face of the countryside but lacks knowledge, so he can only complain that agricultural scientists "don't work hard enough." In short, few of the rural cadres here are as self-serving as some people in the city. They are with the farmers all year round, rain or shine, and everyone wants to change the face of the countryside.

Is everything in the countryside perfect, and are there no problems? There are.

Respected Vice Chairman Zhu, I would like to reflect on some situations and make some suggestions. My political and ideological level is very low, and I inevitably make mistakes. Please forgive me.

1.  The farmers in the mountainous areas of northern Sichuan are still very poor and need assistance. The lives of the farmers here are better than in the past, but they are still poorer than in eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and other regions. Take Linlang Cooperative as a representative: in 1956, the per capita annual income of this cooperative was only forty yuan, and all expenses for food, clothing, use, and housing were covered within these forty yuan. They can only eat three meals of sweet potato porridge a day, plus a bowl of dry pickles. They eat meat once a month, and there is no nutritional value to speak of. It is difficult when they get sores or illnesses. If they have minor illnesses, they don't take medicine, they just drag it out until it gets better. They only take medicine when they are seriously ill because they have no money. For example, Zhu Shibi is over eighty years old and has been sick recently, and his feet are swollen. I went to see him, and he didn't take medicine because he had no money. I also went to see several other farmers' homes, and the quilts had no cloth covers, only cotton batting. They also lacked clothing, and they couldn't change it when it got dirty. The places they live in, the bed, the stove, and the manure pit are connected together, so it is easy to get sick. Now, the farmers generally reflect that "after joining the cooperative, we have food to eat, but no money to spend."

This is a contradiction between the backwardness of production and the people's demand for rapid improvement of their lives. The main solutions are: (1) increase production; (2) develop sideline occupations. (Here, last year and the year before, capitalism was criticized, and crops such as medicinal herbs and cotton were criticized away, and sideline occupations and cash crops are only now being restored.) Because northern Sichuan has a poor foundation, it needs assistance, including economic and technical support. It is also in line with socialist principles for advanced regions to assist backward regions.

2. The culture in the mountainous areas of northern Sichuan is extremely backward. To give a ready example: Linlang Cooperative still does not have an accountant and is concurrently served by an accountant from another cooperative. The literacy class in Linlang Cooperative does not have a teacher, and Zhu Daiwen's granddaughter-in-law (a new student who has only been in the literacy class for one year) is acting as the teacher. Cultural life is poor, and the film crew does not come to the countryside for three or four months (they say they can't make money in the countryside!).

Suggestion: Give priority to developing cultural undertakings in backward mountainous areas, run more schools in backward areas, and allocate more cultural cadres and teachers here. Film crews and theater troupes should not only be concerned with making money. Please order them to serve the people in the mountainous areas even if they don't make money (not just northern Sichuan). It is right to reduce enrollment and run fewer schools now because there are difficulties. However, in culturally backward areas, it is best not to restrict it too much, because they were originally the most lacking in culture. Keep more educated people in the countryside, and don't transfer the best educated people in the countryside away as soon as you transfer cadres.

3. Care for the lives of the masses and promote democracy. Some rural cadres only know how to focus on production and forget that the purpose of production is to live a good life. Some rural cadres urge farmers to produce 360 days a year without allowing them to rest. The special district newspaper published "Accumulate Fertilizer on the First Day of the Lunar New Year," calling on everyone to learn from it even during the Spring Festival without resting. A few days ago, I heard some people in the village say, "Get up early and work late to improve labor productivity" (this may have been proposed by the county). In fact, farmers already work nine or ten hours a day, and it would be harmful to their health to ask them to work even harder. Now, there are many precepts in the countryside, and there are taboos regarding weddings, childbirth, visiting relatives, and celebrating the New Year. District and township cadres make their own new laws and implement them very mechanically. For example, if relatives come to celebrate a wedding and eat a meal, the cadres will criticize and report it in the newspaper if they find out. It is said that someone was pulled out of the sedan chair when they got married in a sedan chair. All things of worshipping gods and ancestors are absolutely prohibited. The cadres have good intentions, but they have forgotten that customs cannot be changed by coercion. I am also an absolute atheist, but I feel that compulsion will produce resentment before the masses' awareness is raised. Because farmers cannot rest and are subject to many restrictions in their lives, they say, "Now we don't worry about eating, but we worry about working and it's not very pleasant!" I have been to some places where the cadres care about the lives of the farmers, the atmosphere of democracy is stronger, and the cadres can enjoy themselves with the people. In such cooperatives in Yilong, I see less of this situation. It is not that the leading cadres in the county are not good, but they only focus on promoting production technology and lack concern for people.

Suggestion: Require cadres to implement Chairman Mao's instruction to care for the lives of the masses, pay attention to improving labor efficiency, and at the same time protect the health of the masses. Do not interfere too much in the private lives of the masses.

4. Continue to carry out the work of opposing bureaucracy and subjectivism among the cadres at the county, district, and township levels, and improve the leadership level of rural cadres. County and district cadres often force orders in production, and the masses are dissatisfied. Many cadres are loyal and conscientious, conveying the instructions of the higher authorities 100% and resolutely implementing them, which is a good thing. But their level is low, they don't use their brains, they don't study the actual situation, and they don't listen to the voices of the masses. This situation is not a small harm to the work. Sometimes, the county gives urgent instructions in a vigorous and resolute manner, but the cadres below don't understand themselves and still make arrangements downwards. For example, Linlang Cooperative resolutely demanded the other day that cooperative members not interplant corn in cotton fields. The cooperative members did not understand and did not implement it. The cadres criticized them. But "Li the Contractor," the cadre who criticized the masses, told me last night: "To be honest, I don't understand either. Cotton fields can be interplanted with corn. My ancestors had experience with it, but the higher authorities just don't allow interplanting." I said, "If you have different opinions, you can report them to the higher authorities. Why didn't you say so?" He said, "I'm afraid of being criticized by the higher authorities. The superiors are afraid of being criticized by the county, and the subordinates are afraid of being blamed by the masses. It's really depressing!" Regardless of whether his opinion is correct or not, the point that "one cannot speak freely even if one has opinions" reflects a problem.

Therefore, I feel that it is very important to improve the leadership level of county, district, and township cadres. Of course, first of all, we must thoroughly oppose subjectivism and bureaucracy. The central government must implement it to the end, and can even send people to inspect and assist the province in strengthening regular political education, commend and reward outstanding rural cadres, and appropriately deal with bad cadres.

Respected Vice Chairman Zhu, please give me your instructions on the above incorrect points.

I think this letter may not be presented to your old self, you are too busy!

Finally, I am very grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for giving us small intellectuals in the editorial office the opportunity to go deep into the countryside and transform ourselves.

With revolutionary greetings.

　　人民生活比过去如何？天上地下
    农村是不是万事大吉？还有问题
    一个知识分子写信给朱德副主席，报告川北仪陇县马鞍乡琳琅村的情况敬爱的朱副主席：
    我在重庆人民出版社编辑部工作，4月中旬来到仪陇县马鞍乡琳琅社体验生活，住在您老人家的故居。不久，我就要回重庆去，现在把我在仪陇所见所闻向您报告一下。
    从重庆动身，经过北碚（锦绣的花园）、合川（川北的粮仓）、南充（天府丝城）、南部（川北的盐场），整整坐了两天的汽车，到达了仪陇县。首先印入眼帘的是九层白塔，接着就看见金城寨、金城公园。仪陇县建筑在山腰，城墙已经拆了，城内只有三条街，丁字形。有两条公路穿城过，一条通巴中、南江，一条通马鞍场。城内新建筑有医院、剧场、中学校、车站和机关宿舍。街道比从前宽阔，但许多民房还是原样。城内有了电灯、小型火力发电厂、自来水。老百姓说：“过去的仪陇，赶场狗咬人，街仄、人少、冷冷清清，白天都要打灯笼（太黑暗）”。“现在的仪陇，赶场人挤人，街宽，人多，热热闹闹，世界光明”。
    仪陇到马鞍，三十七公里。马鞍场老街还是原样未变，街内石柱上有红九军在1933年刻的标语，现在还依稀可辨：“拥护中国共产党！”“打倒日本帝国主义！”“打倒土豪劣绅！”“红九军政治部制。”从前的苏维埃办公处“文昌宫”，现在是中共区委会和区人民委员会。
    马鞍场口，一条新的市街正在形成，新建的卫生所、粮库、供销合作社都在场头。附近，还兴办了一所马鞍中学。
    琳琅寨下边就是琳琅村，这儿青松翠柏，绿荫夹道。寨下有一所小学，现在有九十多个学生。据说，从前这里是一所私塾，是您老人家读书的地方，现在，孩子们很爱护这儿的一草一木。
    这儿的人们，同祖国各处的人民一样，正在伟大的中国共产党领导下，在社会主义大道上前进。
    人民的生活，与过去相比，天上地下。糠菜半年粮的日子，已经一去不返。现在真正是家家不缺粮，户户有吃穿。
    这儿的农民，特别勤俭。长寿的老人很多，如朱世璧、朱世禄、朱世益、朱代文等都是七十以上的老人。朱代文七十四岁了，去年还在社里做了一百多个劳动日。今年还很健康，我向他学挖土，还挖不赢他。前天种地，他挑土粪，一次挑一百多斤，我很惊奇，但老乡们认为是平常事。他真是老农民的典型，穿一身发白的蓝布衫，赤着脚，登着草鞋，一天到晚喜笑颜开，最爱讲过去几十年的故事。他的儿子、孙子都在政府工作，有人问他：“老太爷，你怎么不休息享福啊！”他说：“不做活路就心烦啊！毛主席、朱总司令不是六、七十岁了吗？他们都在干呢！还不是为社会主义，我好意思游手好闲吗！”他就是这样，闲一天也不惯。在社里做活路时，他是认真的，负责的。有一天种花生，我帮他丢种子，他盖土，他看见前面一个妇女不顾质量，把窝窝挖浅了，马上就批评她。我觉得，像朱代文这种人，是社里的榜样，最珍贵的财富，应当很好的尊敬他们。可是，现在有些农村干部，脑袋里有成见，以为“凡是老年人都保守落后”，不重视老人，不接近老人，成天只抓住青年人，不与老人商量，在生产上，往往走冤枉路。
    仪陇的农村干部90％是艰苦朴素的。同我驻在一块有一个区委书记叫王思隆，原来是县委组织部副部长，4月份干部下放，他自愿下乡的，现在兼琳琅社的副主任。他原来是中学生，现在一心想学会做庄稼，下田栽秧，上坡种花生、棉花，他都亲手做，向农民学。还有一个李同志，农民出身，现任区生产委员。他每天都在研究如何搞好劳动组织，给社员想了很多办法。因此，全乡的农民都叫他做“李包工”，说他善于解决包工问题，至于他的本名，倒没有人叫，“李包工”很出名。还有一个统计科的王同志，中学生，下乡搞统计，也帮助农业社工作。他有一个愿望，就是想发明一种新农具或改良一种农作物，他很热情，心急，想改变农村面貌但知识不足，只好埋怨那些农业科学家“为啥不努力”。总之，这里的农村干部很少像城市某些人那样成天为自己打算，他们一年四季天晴落雨同农民在一起，每个人都想改变农村面貌。
    是不是农村万事大吉，没有问题了呢？有的。
    敬爱的朱副主席，我想反映一些情况，并作一些建议。我的政治思想水平很低，难免无错，请原谅。
    一、川北山区农民仍很贫穷，需要援助。这儿农民生活比过去好，但比川东、川西及其他地区还是贫穷的。以琳琅社为代表：这个社1956年每人全年收入不过四十元，吃、穿、用、住都在这四十元内开支。每天只能吃三顿红苕稀饭，外加一碗干咸菜。一个月吃一回肉，营养是说不上的。遇着生疮害病就困难了，害小病不吃药，拖、挨，拖好就算了，病重了才吃药，因为没有钱。例如朱世璧八十多岁，最近病了，脚也肿了，我去看他，他没吃药，因为没钱。我还到好几户农民家里去看过，被盖没布，光棉絮巾巾。穿的也缺，脏了也没法换。住的地方，床、灶、粪坑连在一起，所以容易生病。现在，农民普遍的反映是：“入了社，有饭吃，没钱用。”
    这是生产落后与人民群众要求迅速改善生活的矛盾。解决的办法主要是：（一）提高生产量；（二）开展副业。（这儿去、前年批判资本主义，把药材、棉花等作物批判掉了，现在才恢复副业和经济作物。）由于川北底子穷，需要援助，包括经济上和技术上的支援。请先进地区援助落后地区，这也是符合社会主义原则的。
    二、川北山区文化极其落后，举一个现成的典型例子：琳琅社迄今还没有会计，是另一个社的会计兼任。琳琅社识字班没有教员，是朱代文的孙媳（才读一年识字班的新学生）在充当老师。文化生活贫乏，电影队三、四个月不下乡（他们说农村赚不到钱！）。
    建议：优先开展落后山区的文化事业，在落后地区多办几所学校，多分配一些文化干部、教员到这里来，电影队、剧团不要光图赚钱，请命令他们不赚钱也要为山区人民服务（不光是川北）。现在因为有困难，要少招生、少办学校，这是对的。但在文化落后的地区，最好不要太限制，因为他们原来就最缺文化。多留一些有文化的人在农村，不要一调干部就把农村最好的有文化的人调走。
    三、关心群众生活，发扬民主。有些农村干部只知抓紧生产，而忘了生产的目的正是为了很好的生活。有些农村干部一年三百六十天催着农民生产，不容稍息。专区报上登着“正月初一积肥”，春节也不休息，叫大家学习。前几天，我在村里听有的人提出：“起早摸黑提高劳动生产效率”（这可能是县里提出的）。事实上，农民每天劳动已经是九、十小时了，再要他们加强，对身体是有害的。现在，农村戒律也很多，结婚、生孩、走亲戚、拜年之类都有禁忌。区、乡干部自立新法，执行的很机械。例如，结婚时亲戚来热闹一下，吃一顿饭，干部知道了就要批评、登报。据说有一个人结婚坐花轿，就被从轿里拉出来。一切敬神敬祖先的事绝对禁止。干部居心是好的，但是，他们忘了风俗不是强迫所能改变的。我也是个绝对的无神论者，但是，我觉得群众觉悟未提高以前，强迫会产生反感。由于农民不得将息，生活上受很多限制，于是，他们说：“现在不愁吃的，可是，做起活路来很愁烦，不很愉快！”我走过一些地方，凡是关心农民生活，民主空气较浓厚，干部能与民同乐的社，社内喜气洋溢，社员愉快，生产也真正好。我在仪陇，看见这种情形较少，不是县的领导干部不好，而是他们光注重推广生产技术之类，缺乏对人的关怀。
    建议：要求干部贯彻毛主席关心群众生活的指示，注意提高劳动效率，同时保护群众身体健康。对于群众的私生活，不要干涉太多。
    四、在县、区、乡干部中，继续开展反对官僚主义、主观主义的工作，提高农村干部领导水平。县、区干部在生产上往往强迫命令，群众不满。不少干部忠心耿耿，百分之百传达上级指示，坚决执行，这是好的一方面。但水平低，不用脑筋不研究实际情况，不听群众呼声。这种情况对工作危害不小。有时，县里指示紧急，雷厉风行，下面干部本身不通，也同样向下布置。例如，琳琅社前天坚决要社员不在棉花地里间种苞谷，社员不通，不执行。干部批评。但批评群众的干部“李包工”昨夜对我说：“老实说，我也不通，棉花地可以间种苞谷，我祖辈有经验，可是上级偏不准间种。”我说：“你有不同的意见，可以向上反映，你为啥不说？”他说：“怕上级批评。上怕县级批评，下怕群众埋怨，真苦闷！”姑无论他的意见是否正确，就这“有意见不能畅所欲言”这一点，就反映了一个问题。
    因此，我觉得提高县、区、乡干部的领导水平很重要。当然，首先必须彻底反掉主观主义、官僚主义。中央要贯彻到底，甚至可以派人检查，并协助省加强经常的政治教育，表扬奖励优秀的农村干部，对坏干部适当处理。
    敬爱的朱副主席，以上不对的地方，请指教。
    我想，这封信不一定会呈现在您老人家的眼前，您太忙啦！
    最后，我非常感谢党和毛主席，使我们这些坐编辑室的小知识分子能够有深入农村，改造自己的机会。
    革命的敬礼。
