The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress will officially open today after five days of preparatory meetings.

The content of this meeting is very rich. During the preparatory meetings, the deputies conscientiously discussed Chairman Mao Zedong's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Eleventh Session of the Supreme State Conference, and also held discussions on last year's final accounts, this year's budget, and the annual economic plan. According to the draft agenda adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress yesterday, the formal session will include listening to and discussing Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1956 national final accounts and the 1957 national budget draft, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the implementation results of the 1956 national economic plan and the 1957 national economic plan draft, President Dong Biwu's report on the work of the Supreme People's Court, President Zhang Dingcheng's report on the work of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Secretary-General Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier Ulanhu's report on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and some other items.

This year is the final year of the First Five-Year Plan. What are the results of the work in the past? How should future work be improved? These are the concerns of the delegates to the Congress and also the concerns of the people of the whole country. At the same time, the People's Congress is being held during a time when the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties are carrying out a rectification movement, and the struggle of the people of the whole country against the bourgeois rightists has entered a climax. The central task of this People's Congress, of course, is to determine the current work policy, to determine the national economic plan and state budget for 1957, and in order to do this, it is necessary to seriously summarize experience, correct mistakes, and criticize the rightists.

Regarding summing up experience, a prominent issue at present is that we must first affirm achievements. If there are achievements, they should be affirmed; whatever the amount of achievements, that amount should be affirmed. This was not originally a problem. The reason it has become a problem is that the bourgeois rightists have recently stirred up a counter-current of anti-people and anti-socialism, insisting that one cannot talk about achievements, and that talking about them turns one into a "dogmatist" or a "praiser." Here, we do not intend to refute this fallacy in detail, but only want to point out that the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country are the cause of hundreds of millions of working people, and the achievements of these causes are the fruits of the active actions and arduous struggles of hundreds of millions of working people. Taking 1956 as an example, the ownership of the means of production of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce basically completed the great socialist transformation, who can deny it? The total industrial output value of the country completed and overfulfilled the last year's target of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, who can deny it? The national agriculture overcame serious natural disasters last year, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries still nearly completed the Five-Year Plan, and the total grain output even overfulfilled the Five-Year Plan, who can deny it? Some people are unwilling to praise the people's creation, that is their freedom, but no one has the right to erase the objective facts. What attitude will the people's representatives take towards the fruits of the people's struggle? We believe that at least the vast majority of representatives will give a correct answer to this question.

Whatever the amount of achievements, that is the amount of achievements; whatever the amount of errors and shortcomings, that is the amount of errors and shortcomings. Only fools avoid treatment for their illness. The Communist Party is now carrying out a rectification campaign, and is widely listening to criticisms. The people's government and other state organs, with the Communist Party as the leading core, are also widely listening to criticisms. This is a major step in seriously and systematically improving the work of state organs. The National People's Congress is the highest organ through which the people of the whole country exercise their power. At past meetings, many deputies have provided frank and beneficial criticisms of the work of the state. At this meeting, it is even more necessary to launch serious criticism, and government departments and other state organs also need to conduct in-depth self-criticism of their work. Some people think that since it is necessary to affirm achievements and criticize the rightists, it seems difficult to simultaneously conduct criticism and self-criticism. This is clearly a misunderstanding. Active and well-intentioned criticism of errors and shortcomings will only make the people's socialist cause advance faster, which is completely different from the anti-socialist and anti-people slander of the rightists. The more we can boldly carry out this criticism, and at the same time conduct self-criticism, pointing out the location of the errors, the origin of the errors, and the correct path to correct the errors, the more effectively we can improve our work, the more effectively we can unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and the more effectively we can isolate the rightists.

The criticism of the anti-socialist speeches and actions of the bourgeois rightists is now being carried out in all provinces and cities, and in all parties. This is a major event for the progress of our country's socialist cause, and for the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front. The situation of the preparatory meeting of the People's Congress shows that criticism of the rightists will be one of the main contents of this People's Congress. On the eve of the opening of this People's Congress, Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference was published, which gave the people of the whole country a powerful weapon to fight against the rightists. And because this People's Congress is to discuss various important aspects of the work of the state, it makes it impossible for people not to make serious replies to the erroneous speeches of the rightists in all aspects of the work of the state. Therefore, it can be predicted that this People's Congress will greatly deepen the criticism of the rightists, and will greatly improve the political awareness of the people of the whole country.

### 这一次人民代表大会

　　这一次人民代表大会
    第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议，经过五天的预备会以后，将要在今天正式开幕了。
    这次会议的内容很丰富。在预备会议中，代表们认真地讨论了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议第十一次会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告，并且就去年的决算、今年的预算和年度经济计划进行了座谈。正式会议的议程，据昨天人大常委所通过的草案，将包括听取和讨论周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，李先念副总理关于1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案的报告，薄一波副总理关于1956年度国民经济计划的执行结果和1957年度国民经济计划草案的报告，董必武院长关于最高法院工作的报告，张鼎丞院长关于最高检察院工作的报告，彭真秘书长关于人大常委工作的报告，乌兰夫副总理关于成立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区问题的报告，以及一些其他的项目。
    今年是第一个五年计划的最后一年。过去工作的结果怎么样？今后的工作如何改进？这是大会的代表所关心的，也是全国人民所关心的。同时，这次人代会开会期间，又正值中国共产党和各民主党派开展整风运动，全国人民反对资产阶级右派的斗争进入高潮的时候。这一次的人代会的中心任务，当然是确定当前的工作方针，确定1957年度的国民经济计划和国家预算，而为了作到这些，就必须认真地总结经验，纠正错误，批判右派。
    关于总结经验，目前的一个突出的问题是必须首先肯定成绩。有成绩就应当肯定，有多少成绩就应当肯定多少成绩，这本来是不成为问题的。所以成为问题，是因为资产阶级右派分子最近煽起了一股反人民、反社会主义的逆流，硬说不能讲成绩，讲了就变成“教条主义者”，就变成“歌德派”。在这里，我们不打算来详细批驳这种谬论，只想指出一点，就是我们国家的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业，都是几万万劳动人民的事业，这些事业的成绩是几万万劳动人民积极行动艰苦奋斗得来的果实。拿1956年来说，全国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的生产资料所有制基本上完成了伟大的社会主义改造，谁能够否认？全国工业总产值提前一年完成并且超额完成了五年计划最后一年的指标，谁能够否认？全国农业在去年战胜了严重的自然灾害，农业和农副业的总产值仍然接近完成五年计划，粮食总产量还超额完成了五年计划，谁能够否认？有的人不愿意歌颂人民的创造，那有他们的自由，但是任何人也没有权利抹煞客观的事实。人民的代表，对于人民群众的奋斗的成果，将采取什么态度呢？我们相信，至少绝大多数的代表是会对这个问题作出正确的答案来的。
    有多少成绩就是多少成绩，有多少错误缺点就是多少错误缺点。只有愚蠢的人才讳疾忌医。共产党现在正在整风，正在广泛地听取批评意见。以共产党为领导核心的人民政府和其他的国家机构，也正在广泛地听取批评意见。这是认真地、有系统地改进国家机关工作的重大步骤。全国人民代表大会是全国人民行使权力的最高机关。在过去的几次会议上许多代表们都对于国家工作提供了坦率的有益的批评。在这次会议上，更加需要展开严肃的批评，政府各部门和其他国家机构，对于自己的工作，也更加需要进行深刻的自我批评。有的人以为，既然要肯定成绩，既然要批判右派，就似乎不好同时进行批评和自我批评了。这显然是一种误会。对于错误和缺点的积极的善意的批评，只会使人民的社会主义事业更快地前进，这同右派分子的反社会主义的反人民的诬蔑完全是两回事。我们愈能够放手地开展这种批评，并且同时进行自我批评，指出错误的所在，错误的由来和改正错误的正确道路，我们就愈能够有效地改善工作，也就愈能够有效地团结全国各族人民，也就愈能够孤立右派。
    对于资产阶级右派的反社会主义言论行动的批判，现在全国各省市都在进行，各党派都在进行。这对于我国社会主义事业的进展，对于人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线的巩固，都是一件大事。人代会的预备会的情况表明，对于右派的批判将是这次人代会的主要内容之一。在这次人代会开幕前夕，毛主席在最高国务会议的讲演发表了，这使全国人民反右派的斗争获得了强有力的武器。而这次人代会由于要讨论国家工作的各个重要方面，这也就使人们不能不对右派在国家工作各方面的错误言论作出严正的答复。因此，可以预料，这次人代会将使对右派的批判大大地深入一步，将使全国人民的政治觉悟大大地提高一步。
