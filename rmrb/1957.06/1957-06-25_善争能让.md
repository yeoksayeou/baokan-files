Good at Striving, Good at Yielding
　　Gao Zhi
　　The early summer drizzle moistened the young bamboo outside the window. The verdant young branches and new leaves swayed gently in the breeze, the abundant and overflowing greenness seeming to drip down, to flow out.
　　After reading the first page of the People's Daily on the 14th, listening to the rustling of the rain, and looking at the green bamboo branches, I fell into deep thought. Ideas from all directions seemed like spokes converging on the axis of my mind. The entire page seemed to contain only four characters: Good at Striving, Good at Yielding.
　　The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend was put forward by the Party. The article advocating the policy of "a hundred schools of thought contend" was first published in the Party newspaper. The Party encourages everyone to express their views and contend. Now the People's Daily is also participating in the contention. This is not a retraction, nor a case of fleeting warmth followed by a return to cold, or hesitant loosening; rather, it is helping everyone to express their views healthily and contend reasonably.
　　The People's Daily editorial department criticizes Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily for their errors in viewpoints, and also criticizes the People's Daily's own dogmatism and stereotyped writing style. This gives us a good example of criticism and self-criticism. This is convincing and heartening.
　　The editorial concludes: "...Although some people may temporarily feel uncomfortable, this current debate is absolutely necessary."
　　The Party is good at striving. It was good at striving in the past, and will continue to be good at striving in the future.
　　What the Party strives for is "truth," is "right and wrong." What the Party strives for is to seek happiness for the people and eliminate suffering for the people. What it strived for in the past was to overthrow imperialism and feudalism. What it strives for today is to raise the people's economic and cultural living standards. The Party is striving for time, leading the people of the whole country to build our beloved motherland into a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist country.
　　The Party is not only good at striving, but also good at yielding.
　　What the Party yields is not "right and wrong," not "truth," but material interests and life enjoyment. In the decades before the complete liberation of the mainland, many Party members sacrificed their precious lives for the liberation of the motherland and the emancipation of the people. After the victory of the revolution, today, many Party members give up personal interests and personal privileges.
　　Just take the recent events in several universities in Beijing. The Party committee members and Party member section-level cadres of the Agricultural Mechanization College voluntarily requested to give up their large houses. The Party member president, vice-president, and deputy director of the personnel department voluntarily returned their welfare subsidies. Some Party member cadres of the Beijing Railway College consciously proposed to return a portion of their welfare benefits. In the old society, who had ever heard of such a thing? Before liberation, those of us who worked in universities, who had ever heard of any Kuomintang member principal or staff member giving up their interests?
　　Party members share joys and sorrows with the people. Senior Party cadres carry earth and cultivate the land for the peasants. On the fourth page of the same day's People's Daily, it is reported that nine Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in Guangdong Province sacrificed their lives for the people in flood prevention. Who says that today's China is entirely the world of Party members?
　　These Party members who give up interests, give up privileges, and sacrifice their lives are so worthy of our respect and love! They are not born that way; they are cultivated by the Party.
　　We love the Party, and we must also love ourselves. We must help the Party in its rectification campaign with goodwill and in a better way, and we must also sincerely learn from the Party's spirit of striving for right and wrong and for truth. Helping the rectification campaign is for the Party, but also for the construction of the motherland. Striving for the truth is even more for the 600 million people and our descendants.
　　The rectification campaign is like the early summer drizzle, washing away the dust in people's minds, making people's thoughts, like young bamboo, newer and greener. The motherland has regained its youth, and the motherland will forever be as evergreen as the green bamboo.

　　善争能让
　　高植
    初夏的细雨，润湿了窗外的幼竹，翠绿的嫩枝和新叶，在微风中轻摆着，那充沛盈溢的翠色，仿佛要滴下来、要流出来了。
    看了14日人民日报的第一版，我听着簌簌的雨声，望着青青的竹枝，我沉思着。四面八方的思想，好像轮辐似的，辏集在我的脑轴里。整个的版面似乎
  只有四个字：善争能让。
    百家争鸣的政策是党提出来的。提倡百家争鸣的文章是党报首先登载的。党鼓励大家鸣，鼓励大家争。现在人民日报也参加争鸣了。这不是收，更不是乍暖还寒，欲松还紧，而是帮助大家鸣得健康、争得合理。
    人民日报编辑部批评文汇报和光明日报在观点上的错误，也批评人民日报自己的教条主义和八股文风。这给了我们一个批评与自我批评的好榜样。这叫人心悦诚服。
    社论的末尾说：“……目前的这一场争论，尽管有些人暂时觉得浑身不舒服，却是多么必不可少。”
    党是善于争的，过去善于争，将来还善于争。
    党所争的是“真理”，是“是非”。党所争的，是为人民谋幸福，为人民除痛苦；过去所争的，是打倒帝国主义和封建主义；今天所争的，是提高人民经济与文化生活的水平。党正在争取时间，领导全国人民，把可爱的祖国建成一个富强康乐的社会主义的国家。
    党不仅善于争，还善于让。
    党所让的不是“是非”，不是“真理”，而是物质利益、生活享受。在大陆全部解放之前的数十年中，许多党员为了祖国的解放、为了人民的翻身而牺牲了宝贵的生命。在革命胜利之后，在今天，许多党员放弃个人的利益，放弃个人的待遇。
    单拿最近北京几个高等学校的事来说吧。农业机械化学院党委会的党委委员和党员科长级干部自动要求让出大房子。党员院长、副院长、人事处副处长自动退还了福利补助费。北京铁道学院的一些党员干部自觉地提出退还一部分福利费。在旧社会里，谁听见过这样的事？解放前我们在高等学校工作的人，谁听见过，有任何一个国民党党员校长或职员放弃过他的利益？
    党员与人民共甘苦，同休戚。党员高级干部替工人抬土，替农民种地。在同日的人民日报第四版上登载着：广东省的九名共产党员和共青团员在防洪中为人民献出了生命。谁说今日之中华，全是党员之天下？
    这些让利益、让待遇和献出生命的党员，多么值得我们尊敬，值得我们热爱！他们不是天生的，是党教养出来的。
    我们爱党，也要自爱。我们要善意地更好地帮助党整风，也要诚意地学习党那样地为是非为真理而争的精神。帮助整风是为了党，也是为了祖国的建设。为真理而争，更是为了六亿人民和我们的子子孙孙。
    整风正如初夏的细雨，洗去了人们思想上的灰尘，使人们的思想，像幼竹似地，更新更翠了。祖国恢复了青春，祖国将要永远地像翠竹一样地万古长青。
