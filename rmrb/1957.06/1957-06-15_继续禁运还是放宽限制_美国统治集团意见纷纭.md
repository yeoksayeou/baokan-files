Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, New York Dispatch: "Time" magazine says that there are dissenting opinions within the U.S. government on the question of whether to change the comprehensive trade embargo policy against China.

"Time" magazine wrote that there is a faction that advocates trade with China. The leader of this faction is Randall, chairman of the U.S. government's Council on Foreign Economic Policy and a Chicago industrialist. Eisenhower's chief economic advisor Hauge is sympathetic to Randall's views. Within the State Department, there are also people who agree with this view; for example, Under Secretary of State Herter and Assistant Secretary of State Dillon at least theoretically accept this view.

"Time" magazine believes that Eisenhower's remarks last week on trade with China gave these people a "big boost."

"Time" magazine simultaneously cited officials who oppose trade with China: Secretary of State Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, Secretary of Defense Wilson, and "all the chiefs of staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."

At the same time, American newspapers reported that a movement initiated by many influential members of Congress advocating the revision of the U.S. embargo policy toward China is gaining widespread sympathy. This movement was originally initiated among Democratic congressmen and is now supported by the "liberal faction" within the Republican Party. "Newsweek," in reporting on the remarks made by Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon Johnson last week regarding expanding trade with China, pointed out that "Senators and Representatives seem to largely agree with Johnson's proposition."

　　继续禁运还是放宽限制
　　美国统治集团意见纷纭
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：美国“时代”杂志说，美国政府内部在是否改变对中国的全面贸易禁运政策问题上有着分歧意见。
    “时代”杂志写道，有一派人主张同中国贸易。这一派人的首脑是美国政府对外经济政策委员会主席、芝加哥工业家朗戴尔，艾森豪威尔的首席经济顾问豪吉同情朗戴尔的意见。在国务院内部，也有赞同这种主张的人；例如，副国务卿赫脱和副国务卿帮办狄龙至少在理论上是接受这种意见的。
    “时代”周刊认为艾森豪威尔上星期发表的关于同中国贸易的谈话对这些人起了“很大的打气作用”。
    “时代”周刊同时举出反对同中国贸易的官员有：国务卿杜勒斯，助理国务卿罗伯逊，国防部长威尔逊和“参谋长联席会议的所有参谋长们”。
    同时，美国报刊报道，国会中不少有势力的议员所发起的一个主张修改美国对华禁运政策的运动正获得广泛的同情。这个运动原先是在民主党议员中间发起的，现在得到共和党内的“自由主义派”的支持。美国“新闻周刊”在报道美国参议院民主党领袖林顿·约翰逊上周发表的关于扩大对中国贸易的谈话时指出：“参议员和众议员看来大体上都同意约翰逊的主张”。
