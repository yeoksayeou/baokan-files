Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. According to the Soviet "Atomic Energy" magazine, the famous Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States is building a synchrophasotron capable of accelerating protons to 25 to 30 billion electron volts (the largest synchrophasotron currently operating in the Soviet Union has a proton energy of 10 billion electron volts). The construction of the accelerator is scheduled to be completed in three years.

	This accelerator, in terms of its working principle and some characteristics, is similar to the synchrophasotron being designed in the Soviet Union, which will accelerate protons to 50 to 60 billion electron volts. It is based on the method of "strong" magnetic focusing of accelerated particle beams discovered in 1952 by some physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

	Protons first obtain an energy of 750,000 electron volts from the Cockcroft-Walton generator. In the linear accelerator, the proton energy is further increased to 50 million electron volts, and then the proton beam is injected into the synchrophasotron using an electrostatic device. The basic part of the synchrophasotron is 240 magnets, which form a large circle with a radius of 128 meters. This large magnetic ring track will be installed in an underground tunnel about 5.45 meters high and 5.5 meters wide, covered with 1.5 meters of soil. The proton energy in the accelerator can be continuously accelerated to 25 to 30 billion electron volts. When the accelerator is first built, it can emit one billion particles every three seconds, and later it can be increased to one hundred billion particles.

	It is planned to use specific locations with concrete protection layers in a portion of the underground tunnel as targets, which is where accelerated protons bombard atomic nuclei to further study the mysteries of atomic nuclei.

	The accelerator is remotely controlled, and the control location is also underground, with a soil protection layer more than fifteen meters thick.

    原子科学日新月异
    苏美都在建立巨型同步稳相加速器
    新华社莫斯科7日电　据苏联“原子能”杂志最近报道，美国著名的布罗克海温国家实验所正在建造能够把质子加速到二百五十亿至三百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器（目前苏联已经在运转的世界上最大的同步稳相加速器质子能量为一百亿电子伏特）。加速器的建设预定三年完成。
    这个加速器就其工作原理与某些特点看来，类似苏联正在设计的、把质子加速到五百亿至六百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器。它所依据的方法是布罗克海温国家实验所一些物理学家在1952年发现的把加速粒子流加以“强”磁聚焦的方法。
    质子首先从考克饶夫——华耳顿发生器获得七十五万电子伏特的能量。在直线加速器中，质子能量再增加到五千万电子伏特，然后利用静电装置把质子流射入同步稳相加速器内。同步稳相加速器的基本部分是二百四十块磁铁，这些磁铁围成一个半径一百二十八公尺的大圆圈。这个大磁铁环行道将装在一个高约五点四五公尺和宽约五点五公尺的地下隧道中，上面复有一点五公尺厚的土。质子能量在加速器内可以一直加速到二百五十亿至三百亿电子伏特。加速器在刚建成时可以每隔三秒钟射出十亿个粒子，以后可以增加到一千亿个粒子。
    预定将以地下隧道一部分具有水泥防护层的特定地点用作靶子，这就是用加速的质子轰击原子核，进一步研究原子核奥秘的所在。
    加速器是远距离操纵的，操纵地点也在地下，它的土质防护层有十五公尺多厚。
