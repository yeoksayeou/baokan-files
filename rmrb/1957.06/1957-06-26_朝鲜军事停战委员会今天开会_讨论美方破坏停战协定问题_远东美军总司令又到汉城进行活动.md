Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: At the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission will hold a meeting at 2:00 PM on June 26 to discuss issues such as US violations of the armistice agreement.

Seoul News: Far East US Military Commander, Lanzil, flew to Seoul again on the evening of June 24. He will discuss with the Syngman Rhee group the issue of transporting modern weapons into South Korea. Lanzil had engaged in similar activities in Seoul on June 21. On that day, the US announced that it would unilaterally abolish relevant clauses of the Korean Armistice Agreement and transport new weapons to South Korea.

On the 25th, Lanzil admitted in Seoul that the United States and its puppet countries had "paid an extremely high price" in the war of aggression against Korea. He said that in the war of aggression against Korea, the US suffered a total of 1.4 million casualties, including 500,000 deaths.

According to United Press International, US military authorities stationed in South Korea confirmed on June 24 that approximately two months before the US unilaterally announced its intention to abolish Paragraph Two of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, the United States had already transported new H-21 helicopters capable of transporting combat troops into South Korea.

According to the Associated Press, the first batch of F-100 supersonic jets that the United States originally planned to transport to South Korea yesterday was delayed due to the need to "avoid inappropriate publicity."

Pyongyang News: Choi Won-taek, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee, stated in a speech on the 24th that the US imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the armistice agreement is an attempt to turn South Korea into a military base for aggression against Asia and to forever reduce South Korea to a colony. US imperialism is brewing war in Korea in order to create a war atmosphere internationally, to obstruct the Korean people's reunification of Korea, and to prevent the collapse of Syngman Rhee's rule. Ding Qixing, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said that despite the provocative conspiracies of the US aggressors, they cannot frustrate the will of peace-loving people around the world and the Korean people.

Warsaw News: The Polish "People's Forum" published a commentary condemning the United States for undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. The "People's Forum" opposed the US claim that so-called modern weapons had already been transported into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and recalled that it was the US side that prohibited the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams, which means that it was not North Korea, but the US side, that wanted to undermine the armistice agreement.

The newspaper pointed out that Poland, as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, can only say this: These actions by the United States certainly do not help to ease the tense situation in Korea; on the contrary, these actions have created an atmosphere that makes the unification of Korea even more difficult than in the past.

Prague News: "Red Rights Daily" believes that the United States' violation of the clause in the Korean Armistice Agreement prohibiting the import of new weapons threatens the Korean armistice and peace in Asia.

The newspaper concluded: "All peace-loving people in the world undoubtedly stand on the side of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which have once again proved to be pillars of peace in the Far East."

　　朝鲜军事停战委员会今天开会
    讨论美方破坏停战协定问题
    远东美军总司令又到汉城进行活动
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：在朝中方面的建议下，军事停战委员会将在6月26日下午二时举行会议，讨论关于美方违反停战协定等问题。
    汉城消息：远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔6月24日晚上再次飞到汉城，他将同李承晚集团商量把现代化武器运进南朝鲜的问题。兰尼兹尔曾经在6月21日到汉城进行过同样的活动。美方在当天宣布，它要片面废除朝鲜停战协定有关条款，把新武器运到南朝鲜。
    25日，兰尼兹尔在汉城承认，美国和它的仆从国家在侵朝战争中“付出了极高的代价”。他说，在侵朝战争中，美方一共伤亡了一百四十万人，其中死亡的有五十万人。
    据合众社报道，驻在南朝鲜的美军当局6月24日证实，在美方片面宣布要废除停战协定第十三款卯项之前约两个月，美国已经把能够装运作战部队的新式的H—二十一型直升飞机运进了南朝鲜。
    据美联社报道，美国原定在昨天运进南朝鲜的第一批F—一○○超音速喷气机，由于要“避免不适当的公开”，运达的时间延迟了。
    平壤消息：朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长崔元泽24日发表谈话说，美帝国主义破坏停战协定的阴谋是企图变南朝鲜为侵略亚洲的军事基地，使南朝鲜永远沦为殖民地。美帝国主义在朝鲜酝酿战争，是为了在国际上造成战争气氛，并且阻挠朝鲜人民统一朝鲜，防止李承晚统治的垮台。朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会副委员长丁七星说，尽管美国侵略者制造挑衅阴谋，但是不能挫折全世界爱好和平人民和朝鲜人民的意志。
    华沙消息：波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论，谴责美国破坏了朝鲜停战协定。“人民论坛报”反对美国叫嚷的所谓现代化武器已经被运入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的这种说法；并且追述说，禁止中立国监察委员会视察小组活动的正是美方，这就是说，想要破坏停战协定的不是北朝鲜，而是美方。
    报纸指出，作为中立国监察委员会委员的波兰只能这样说：美国的这些行动肯定地无助于缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，相反，这些行动造成了使朝鲜的统一比过去更为困难的一种气氛。
    布拉格消息：“红色权利报”认为美国破坏朝鲜停战协定中关于禁止运入新武器的条款的行为，威胁着朝鲜停战和亚洲和平。
    这家报纸最后说：“全世界一切爱好和平的人民都无可争辩地站在再一次表现为远东和平的支柱的中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一边。”
