　　Producing Four Thousand Vehicles Six Months Ahead of Schedule
    First Automobile Factory Completes Five-Year Plan Task
    (Our dispatch from Changchun, June 25) Today, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant produced its 4,000th "Liberation" brand vehicle. According to the stipulations of the first Five-Year Plan, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was to produce 4,000 vehicles by the end of 1957; now, the plant has completed this task six months and five days ahead of schedule.
    After the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant officially began production last October, it encountered two major difficulties. One difficulty was the insufficient quantity and poor quality of the steel and collaborative products required for manufacturing automobiles; the other difficulty was that the technical and management skills of the employees were not suited to the requirements of modern automobile production. After several months of effort, all employees of the plant have basically mastered the technology of automobile production. Hundreds and thousands of workers have broken through their quotas and won the title of advanced producer. The old cadres, who were previously called "white hats," now also have a preliminary understanding of factory management knowledge and are steadily leading production work. At present, the design personnel are working hard to study and prepare to design six new types of automobiles suitable for China's needs, to open up a new road for China's automobile industry.
    All employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant also devised many methods to overcome the difficulty of insufficient steel. By modifying the product design, the amount of steel required for each vehicle was reduced by more than 110 jin compared to the past. Employees in the forging workshop adopted edge materials and scrap ends, improved operating methods, and reduced steel consumption, so that the forgings for each vehicle used 28.8 kilograms less steel than in the past. The First Automobile Factory and various metallurgical factories across the country are working together to further solve the technical problems of using domestic steel. A technical conclusion has now been reached: more than 90% of the steel required by the First Automobile Factory can be supplied domestically. All of the more than 400 types of automobile collaborative products required by the First Automobile Factory are also supplied domestically. Bourgeois experts once said: "You can build an automobile factory, but you cannot produce the steel needed for automobiles, how can you manufacture automobiles?" The above facts ruthlessly shattered this fallacy!

### 提前半年生产出四千辆汽车  第一汽车厂完成五年计划任务

　　提前半年生产出四千辆汽车
    第一汽车厂完成五年计划任务
    本报长春25日电  今天，第一汽车制造厂生产出了第四千号“解放牌”汽车。按照国家第一个五年计划的规定，第一汽车制造厂要在1957年底以前生产出四千辆汽车；现在，这个厂提前半年零五天完成了这一任务。
    去年10月，第一汽车制造厂正式投入生产以后，发生了两大困难。一个困难是制造汽车所需要的钢材和协作产品数量不足，质量不高；另一个困难是职工的技术水平和管理水平，不能适应现代汽车生产的要求。经过几个月来的努力，全厂职工已经基本上掌握了生产汽车的技术。成百上千的工人突破了定额，荣获先进生产者的称号。过去被人称做“白帽子”的老干部，现在也初步懂得了工厂的管理知识，稳健地领导着生产工作。目前，设计人员正在努力钻研，准备设计出适合中国需要的六种新型汽车，为中国汽车工业开辟一条新的道路。
    第一汽车制造厂全体职工还想出许多办法来战胜钢材不足的困难。经过修改产品设计，每辆汽车所需用的钢材，比过去节省一百一十多斤。锻工车间职工采用边料、料头，改进操作方法，减少钢材用量，使每辆汽车的锻件比过去少用二十八点八公斤钢材。第一汽车厂和全国各个冶金工厂正在共同努力，进一步解决采用国产钢材技术上的问题。现在已经在技术上作出结论：第一汽车厂所需要的钢材，可以由国内供应90％以上。第一汽车厂所需要的四百多种汽车协作产品，也全部由国内供应。资产阶级专家曾经说：“你们能够建成汽车厂，但是你们不能生产汽车所需要的钢材，怎么能制造出汽车呢？”上述事实无情地粉碎了这种谬论！
