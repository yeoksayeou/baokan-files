　　Refuting the "Encirclement" Theory
　　He Ming
    When everyone collectively refutes anti-socialist fallacies, those who persist in anti-socialism cannot help but feel great pressure; therefore, they say that this refutation is an "encirclement." This can be considered their heartfelt sentiment!
    What is strange about blatantly opposing socialist fallacies and being "encircled" by the people? Wouldn't it be better to "剿" (exterminate) anti-socialist fallacies sooner rather than later? "Collective refutation" is an objective inevitability; if you oppose the people's world, how can the people not collectively refute you?
    The "encirclers" and the "encircled" are inherently hostile. Today, we still refute those who are anti-socialist and their fallacies based on reason, without going beyond the scope of reasoning; and we still give them the right and opportunity to speak. Moreover, the path for them to correct their mistakes is very broad. Why not call this situation salvation, but instead call it "encirclement"?
    Perhaps, they think this way! They have so few speakers; so many people refute anti-socialist remarks, and the momentum is so great; isn't this "encirclement"? There's no way around that; there are just so many people who support socialism, and the momentum of socialism is just so great!
    Rightist gentlemen: The people collectively refute you based on reason. Will you persist in anti-socialist remarks, or will you abandon anti-socialist remarks? If you choose the former, of course, you will feel "encircled"; if you choose the latter, then you will feel that the people have extended a saving hand, preventing you from falling off the socialist train and into the mud.

　　斥“围剿”说
　　何明
    大家同声驳斥反社会主义的谬论，坚持反社会主义的人不能不感到很大的压力；于是他们说，这种驳斥是“围剿”。这也算是他们的由衷之言吧！
    明目张胆地反对社会主义的谬论，受到人民的“围剿”有什么奇怪呢？反社会主义的谬论，不是早点“剿”除的好吗？“同声驳斥”是客观的必然；你反对人民的天下，人民岂能不同声驳斥？
    “围剿”者和被“围剿”者本来是敌对的。我们今天对那些反社会主义的人，对他们的谬论仍然是据理驳斥，并未超出说理范围以外；并且仍然给他们发言的权利和机会；他们改正错误的路子更是十分宽广的。为什么不把这种情形叫作挽救，而叫作“围剿”呢？
    也许，他们是这样想的吧！他们发言人数这样少；驳斥反社会主义言论的人这样多，声势这么大，这岂不是“围剿”？那可没有办法；拥护社会主义的人就是这么多，社会主义的声势就是这么大嘛！
    右派先生们：人民同声据理驳斥，你们是坚持反社会主义言论呢？还是放弃反社会主义言论呢？若是选择前者当然会感到被“围剿”；若是选择后者，那么你们会感到人民伸出了挽救的手，不使你们摔下社会主义的车去，掉在污泥里。
