The Dead End of America's China Policy
Gu Si

		Dreams Shattered
The anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan on May 24th cut open the festering sore of America's China policy. This act exposed the deep contradictions between the American invaders and the Taiwanese people who refuse to be America's prey, revealing the Taiwanese people's boundless indignation and strong protest against America's plot to separate them from their motherland. The dream of American imperialism to permanently control Taiwan and split China using the Chiang Kai-shek clique has been shattered.

The anti-American demonstrations by the Taiwanese people proved the already existing fact that America's China policy has completely gone bankrupt. Despite the fact that national scum like Yeh Kung-chao and Dong Xian Guang kowtowed to the United States to beg for mercy, and Chiang Kai-shek even issued a self-incriminating proclamation in the style of "misfortunes affecting ancestors", and the US State Department also tried its best to gloss over the nature of the incident, a re-examination of America's China policy has become a unanimous cry in American domestic and world opinion.

Within the United States, following the American press's criticism of the State Department for not allowing reporters to visit China, the public opinion opposing America's current unrealistic China policy has formed an unprecedentedly high tide. John Cowles, a leader of the American press, called for a revision of America's China policy in a speech to avoid "a shameful diplomatic failure." Some more insightful people believe that the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan show that it is impossible for the United States to separate Taiwan from China. An article in the "Nation" magazine on June 8th stated that "the events in Taipei broke a myth and at the same time nakedly revealed reality: the people of Taiwan are Chinese—not even Americans through adoption—and will eventually strive to go their own way."

The "New York Times" has published many articles in succession, proposing "the necessity to reconsider the (China) issue and seek a final solution." The newspaper's military commentator, Baldwin, believes that Taiwan as a base is not very important to the United States. Zablocki, chairman of the House of Representatives Far East Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, stated that "our attitude towards Taiwan should be thoroughly reviewed."

Under the pressure of this public opinion, Senators Knowland and Robertson, a group of people who firmly advocate hostility towards China and the occupation of Taiwan, appeared very panicked. Robertson has delivered many speeches in succession, wantonly slandering the Chinese people, attempting to prove that the current China policy that is on the verge of collapse cannot be changed. Some even proposed to stop the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva in order to prevent the possibility of changing the policy. However, according to Agence France-Presse reporter Michaud, Knowland and Robertson are increasingly losing power, and what they are conducting is "a battle that was lost in advance."

		Britain's "Declaration of Independence"
Just as the saying goes, "Misfortunes never come singly." Just one week after the anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people, Britain announced on May 30th its decision to independently relax trade restrictions on China. Britain had been negotiating with the United States in Paris for a long time on the issue of relaxing the embargo on China, but the United States resolutely refused to give in, wanting to continue to impose its will on others. Under these circumstances, Britain took its own steps despite American opposition. This action by Britain was regarded by American newspapers as Britain's "Declaration of Independence" and was greeted with cheers by British public opinion.

The US official response to this action by Britain, apart from expressing "great disappointment," was also helpless. However, this action by Britain further promoted domestic dissatisfaction in the United States with the government's China policy. Members of the US Congress were divided into two factions, one of which believed that Britain's actions were undermining Anglo-American relations, while the other believed that Britain had the right to do so and advocated that the United States should do the same. Senator Lyndon Johnson, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that Britain's actions "will make it necessary for us to re-estimate the entire situation of trade with China." Behind this faction is the strong support of the American business community.

At a press conference on June 5th, when Eisenhower talked about the issue of relaxing the embargo on China, he said that he "favors the faction that believes that trade cannot be prevented in the end." His remarks were considered to be a deliberately released "trial balloon."

All of this situation made Colbert, chairman of the "American China Policy Association," who has always advocated hostility towards the Chinese people, panicked and said that the forces advocating recognition of China are working together.

		Chain Reaction
America's China policy is a part of America's foreign policy, and it involves many aspects of American foreign policy. Therefore, the failure of America's China policy, as revealed through the anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people and Britain's relaxation of the embargo, has caused a chain reaction throughout the world.

After the anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people occurred, anti-American sentiment around the world was immediately prominently displayed. Whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa, universal sympathy was expressed for this anti-American demonstration. The lawlessness of American troops stationed on foreign soil has become the focus of concentrated attacks by the local people. The Philippines, Japan, and other countries took this opportunity to put pressure on the United States, demanding that the United States resolve the issue of extraterritoriality for US troops stationed in their countries. Under the pressure of overwhelming public anger, the US State Department and the Department of Defense had no choice but to disregard the opposition of the Department of the Army and decided to hand over Girard, the American murderer who killed a Japanese farmer's wife, to the Japanese court for trial. Within the United States, the issue of reducing troops stationed abroad and reconsidering US military bases abroad has also been raised.

Britain's action to relax the embargo on China has made Western countries very excited. Norway has already announced the relaxation of trade with China. Some predict that, with the exception of West Germany, many countries in Western Europe may follow in Britain's footsteps. Although Japan also hopes to expand trade with China, because Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is preparing to visit the United States to request funds from the United States to expand into Southeast Asia, it does not dare to immediately follow Britain. It is now adopting a posture that can be described as "extremely considerate" to the United States, walking a tightrope between Britain and the United States so that it can both benefit from the relaxation of the embargo and not offend the United States.

However, the chain reaction does not stop there. China is an important country in the world, and many major international issues cannot be resolved without China's participation. The unreality of America's China policy has also been criticized in other areas. On the issue of disarmament, the United States attempts to exclude China, but this is obviously absurd. The "Washington Post" has already said that the disarmament plan to be proposed by the United States has a flaw, "that is, any direct negotiations do not include China. But it is absurd to assume that the most populous country in the world can truly be disregarded." The newspaper believes that sooner or later this will become "a problem that must be dealt with."

At the same time, with the failure of America's China policy, countries that previously did not dare to recognize China under American pressure have begun to consider the issue of recognizing China. Former Chairman of the French National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, Bonnet, proposed on June 3 that France should recognize China. There have already been predictions that when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations this autumn, the situation may change. America's situation will become more difficult and isolated.

The series of criticisms of America's China policy triggered by the anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people reflects an increasingly obvious trend in the current development of the international situation, that is, the universal demand of the people of all countries to ease international tensions and to expand contacts in various fields to increase mutual understanding. Under this situation, America's China policy, which aims to create tensions in Asia, is becoming increasingly unpopular. If the American ruling group does not change course, it will face greater opposition at home and abroad and fall into a more isolated predicament.

		Blind Men and Blind Horses
America's China policy has reached a dead end. What will the United States do in the future?

Judging from the situation in various aspects, there are three factions of opinions within the American ruling group on the issue of China policy.

One faction is the one that advocates being deadlocked to the end, stubbornly adhering to the current rigid policy. This is the Knowland, Robertson and their ilk. However, in the face of ruthless reality, this faction is losing its arguments and supporters.

The second faction is the one that advocates making partial adjustments. They see the general trend and that if they adhere to the rigid policy, the United States will fall into extreme isolation and suffer losses on practical interests issues such as trade. Eisenhower's remarks at the June 5th press conference showed that he advocated relaxing the embargo on China, but still does not recognize China. That is to say, he is still determined to be a blind man who cannot see the great power with 600 million people.

The third faction is the one that advocates making the "two Chinas" conspiracy public. This is the advocacy of the "New York Times" and the "New York Post" which are connected to the US State Department. They believe that the United States can no longer close its eyes to the fact that there is a new China and must seek a final solution. They advocate recognizing China. However, on the Taiwan issue, they refuse to give up American aggression and advocate using the method of engaging in "two Chinas" and so-called UN trusteeship of Taiwan to seek a solution. In other words, they want to use China's territory Taiwan as the burial object of the failed American China policy. This is of course absolutely impossible. Therefore, this faction is actually also a blind horse. Their proposal will never lead the United States out of the dead end of its China policy.

Despite the noise and clamor within the United States on the issue of China policy, it seems that one thing is certain: the day when the American ruling group walks out of this dead end is still a long way off.

### 山穷水尽的美国对华政策
顾思

专栏：两周时事述评

    山穷水尽的美国对华政策
    顾思
            梦想幻灭了
    5月24日台湾人民的反美大示威，给美国对华政策的脓疮开了一刀。这一刀，揭露了美国侵略者同不愿做美国的俎上之肉的台湾人民之间的深刻矛盾，显示了台湾人民对于美国把他们同祖国大陆分割开来的阴谋的无限愤慨和强烈抗议。美国帝国主义利用蒋介石集团企图永远控制台湾、分裂中国的梦想幻灭了。
    台湾人民的反美大示威，证明了早已存在的这个事实：美国的对华政策已经彻底破产。尽管叶公超、董显光之类的民族败类向美国叩头求饶，蒋介石还发表了“祸延先考”式的请罪文告，美国国务院也竭力企图粉饰事件的性质，但是，重新审查美国对华政策，却已经成为美国国内和世界舆论的一致呼声。
    在美国国内，紧跟着美国新闻界抨击国务院不许记者访问中国之后，反对美国现行的不现实的对华政策的舆论，形成了一股空前高涨的潮流。美国报界的一个领袖约翰·考尔斯，在一次演说中要求修改美国对华政策，以避免“丢脸的外交失败”。一些较有见识的人，认为台湾的反美大示威说明美国要把台湾从中国分裂出去是不可能的。6月8日“民族”周刊上的一篇文章就说，“台北的事件打破了一个神话，并且同时把现实赤裸裸地揭露出来：台湾的人民是中国人——甚至通过过继的手续也不是美国人——并且最终会努力走他们自己的道路。”
    “纽约时报”接连发表了许多文章，提出“有必要重新考虑（中国）问题，并寻求最后解决办法”。这家报纸的军事评论员鲍德温认为，台湾作为一个基地，对于美国来说，并不是非常重要的。众议院的远东外交小组委员会主席扎布洛基则表示，“应该对我们关于台湾的态度进行彻底的审查”。
    在这种舆论的压力下，参议员诺兰和助理国务卿罗伯逊这一帮坚决主张敌视中国、侵占台湾的人，显得十分恐慌。罗伯逊接连发表了许多演说，对中国人民大肆诬蔑，企图证明目前已临绝路的对华政策是改变不得的。有人甚至提出要停止在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈，以杜绝改变政策的可能。但是，据法新社的记者密肖认为，诺兰和罗伯逊都在日益失势，他们所进行的是“一场事先就输掉的战斗”。
            英国的“独立宣言”
    正像俗语所说，“祸不单行”。台湾人民反美示威事件刚刚过去一个星期，英国在5月30日宣布决定单独放宽对中国的贸易限制。英国在巴黎同美国就放宽对华禁运问题商谈了很久，但是美国坚决不肯让步，想继续把自己的意志强加于人。在这种情况下，英国不顾美国的反对，采取了自己的步骤。英国这个行动，被美国的报纸认为是英国的“独立宣言”，并且得到了英国舆论的欢呼。
    美国官方对于英国这个行动，除了表示“非常失望”以外，却也无可奈何。然而，英国的这个行动，却进一步推动了美国国内对于政府对华政策的不满。美国国会议员们分成了两派，一派认为英国这样做是破坏英美关系的，另一派却认为英国有权这样做，并且主张美国自己也应该这样做。参议院民主党领袖林顿·约翰逊就说，英国的行动“将使我们有必要重新估计整个对华贸易的形势”。在这一派后面，有着美国企业界的有力支持。
    在6月5日的记者招待会上，艾森豪威尔在谈到放宽对华禁运问题的时候说，他是“赞成相信终究无法制止贸易这一派的”。他这番谈话，被认为是故意放出来的“试探气球”。
    这一切情况，使得一贯主张敌视中国人民的“美国对华政策协会”主席柯尔堡惊慌不安地说，主张承认中国的势力正在协同努力。
              连锁反应
    美国对华政策是美国外交政策的一部分，它牵涉到美国外交政策的许多方面。因此，通过台湾人民反美大示威和英国放宽禁运而显露出来的美国对华政策的失败，在世界各地都引起了连锁反应。
    在台湾人民反美大示威发生以后，世界各地的反美情绪，立刻突出地表现出来了。不论在欧洲、亚洲和非洲等地，都对这次反美示威表示了普遍的同情。在外国领土上驻扎着的美国军队的胡作非为，成了当地人民集中攻击的对象。菲律宾、日本等国趁此机会，对美国施加压力，要求美国解决驻扎在它们国家里的美军的治外法权问题。在众怒难犯的压力下，美国国务院和国防部只好不顾陆军部的反对，决定把杀害日本农妇的美国凶手哲腊德交给日本法庭审判。在美国国内，关于减少驻在国外的军队、重新考虑美国在国外的军事基地的问题，也被提了出来。
    英国放宽对华禁运的行动，使西方国家十分兴奋。挪威已经宣布放宽对华贸易。有人预测说，除了西德以外，西欧的许多国家，都可能步英国的后尘。日本虽然也希望扩大对华贸易，可是由于日本首相岸信介准备访问美国，要求美国给它向东南亚扩张的资金，所以它不敢马上跟着英国走。它现在采取一种对美国可说是“体贴入微”的姿态，在英国和美国之间走钢丝，以便既可以从放宽禁运中得利，又不至于得罪美国。
    然而，连锁反应还不止于此。中国是世界上举足轻重的大国，许多重大国际问题，没有中国参加是不可能解决的。美国对华政策的不现实，在其他方面也遭到了批评。在裁军问题上，美国企图把中国排除在外，可是这显然是荒唐的事情。“华盛顿邮报”已经说了，美国将要提出的裁军方案有一个缺陷，“就是任何直接谈判都不包括中国。但是假如设想这个世界上人口最多的国家真正可以不算数，那是荒唐的”。报纸认为，迟早这将成为“一个必须处理的问题”。
    同时，随着美国对华政策的失败，从前在美国压力下不敢承认中国的国家，已开始考虑承认中国的问题。前法国国民议会外交委员会主席庞纳福，在6月3日提出了法国应该承认中国的主张。已经有人在预测，在今年秋季联合国大会上，讨论恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位问题的时候，情况可能发生变化。美国的处境将更加困难和孤立。
    从台湾人民反美示威引起的对于美国对华政策的一系列的抨击，反映了当前国际局势发展中一个日益明显的趋向，这就是各国人民普遍要求和缓国际紧张局势，要求扩大各方面的接触来增加相互之间的了解。在这种情势下，以在亚洲制造紧张局势为目的的美国对华政策，越来越不得人心了。美国统治集团如果再不改弦易辙，它在国内和国外都将遭到更大的反对，陷于更加孤立的困境。
              盲人和瞎马
    美国对华政策已经到了山穷水尽的地步。美国今后怎么办？
    从各方面的情况看来，美国统治集团内部在对华政策问题上有三派意见。
    一派是主张死硬到底的，顽固地坚持现行的僵硬政策。这就是诺兰、罗伯逊之流。但是，这一派在无情的现实面前，正在丧失自己的论据和支持者。
    第二派是主张作局部调整的。他们看到大势所趋，如果坚持僵硬的政策，美国就会陷于十分孤立，并且在像贸易问题这一类实际利益问题上吃亏。艾森豪威尔在6月5日记者招待会上的谈话表明，他主张放宽对中国禁运，但是仍然不承认中国。这就是说，他仍然决心做一个看不见六亿人民的大国的瞎子。
    第三派是主张使“两个中国”的阴谋公开化的。这是同美国国务院有联系的“纽约时报”以及“纽约邮报”之类的主张。他们认为，美国不能再闭眼不看存在着新中国的事实，必须寻求最后的解决办法。他们主张承认中国。但是，在台湾问题上，他们却不肯放弃美国的侵略，而主张用搞“两个中国”、搞所谓联合国托管台湾的办法，来求得解决。换句话说，他们要用中国的领土台湾，做倒霉的美国对华政策的陪葬品。这当然是绝对办不到的事情。因此，这一派实际上也是瞎马。他们的主张决不可能把美国引出它的对华政策的死胡同。
    尽管美国国内在对华政策问题上吵吵嚷嚷，看来，可以肯定的一点是：美国统治集团走出这条死胡同的日子，还远得很哩。
