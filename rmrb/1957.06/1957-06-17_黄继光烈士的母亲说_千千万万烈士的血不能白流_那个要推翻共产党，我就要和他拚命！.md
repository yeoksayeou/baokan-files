Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th. Deng Fangzhi, representative of the National People's Congress and mother of martyr Huang Jiguang, published a statement in a Chengdu newspaper yesterday refuting anti-socialist remarks.

　　In her statement, Deng Fangzhi said that Ge Peiqi said that the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party, that if the Communist Party is destroyed, China will not be destroyed; and that the people want to oppose the Communist Party and the masses want to kill the Communist Party. He is truly stealing the name of the people and lying through his teeth. Deng Fangzhi continued, based on what she has seen in her hometown of Jiguang Township in Zhongjiang County and the places she has inspected, not a single common person does not support the Communist Party. If someone resents the Communist Party, it is only a small group of counter-revolutionaries and reactionary landlords and rich peasants, definitely not the masses of the people.

　　Deng Fangzhi said: "My son Jiguang shed his last drop of blood in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Recently, from the movie 'Dong Cunrui', I also saw Dong Cunrui sacrificing himself to destroy the enemy's碉堡 [blockhouse, pillbox]. They are all flesh and blood from their mothers' bodies, and their mothers reluctantly parted with them to protect the fruits of victory and for the common happiness of the people of the whole country. Now, I cannot let my son's and thousands upon thousands of martyrs' blood be shed in vain; anyone who wants to overthrow the Communist Party, I will fight them to the death! The working class must firmly grasp the reins of power and consolidate the people's regime based on the worker-peasant alliance."

　　黄继光烈士的母亲说
　　千千万万烈士的血不能白流
　　那个要推翻共产党，我就要和他拚命！
    新华社成都16日电　全国人民代表大会代表、黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝昨天在成都报纸上发表谈话，驳斥反社会主义言论。
  　邓芳芝在谈话中说，葛佩琦说甚么群众要推翻共产党，共产党亡了，中国不会亡；还说人民要反对共产党，群众要杀共产党。他真是盗用人民的名义，睁开眼睛说瞎话。邓芳芝接着说，从她家乡中江县继光乡和她视察工作到过的地方来看，没有一个老百姓不拥护共产党的。如果说有人怨恨共产党，那只是一小撮反革命分子和反动的地主、富农，决不是人民群众。
    邓芳芝说：“我的儿子继光在抗美援朝战争中流尽了最后一滴血。最近我从电影‘董存瑞’中，又看到董存瑞舍身炸毁敌人的碉堡。他们都是母亲身上掉下的骨肉，为了保卫胜利果实，为了全国人民共同幸福，他们的母亲才忍痛割爱。现在，我不能让我的儿子和千千万万烈士的鲜血白流；那个要推翻共产党，我就要和他拚命！工人阶级要紧紧掌稳印把子，巩固以工农联盟为基础的人民政权。”
