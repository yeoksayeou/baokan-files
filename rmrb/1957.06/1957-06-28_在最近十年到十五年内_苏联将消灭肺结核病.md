　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th. The Soviet Union will eliminate pulmonary tuberculosis nationwide within the next ten to fifteen years. This was stated by the Deputy Minister of Health of the Soviet Union, Khomutov, at the Sixth All-Union Congress of Tuberculosis Control Workers recently.
　　Due to the widespread implementation of anti-tuberculosis vaccination, timely lung examinations for residents, and effective drug treatment, the mortality rate from lung disease among urban residents in the Soviet Union last year decreased by 70% compared to 1949, and the morbidity rate decreased by 43%. Every district in the city now has X-ray fluoroscopy equipment. In the future, every resident of the Soviet Union will undergo a lung examination at least once every two to three months.
　　The Soviet Union also widely uses antibacterial therapy. This therapy has created conditions for the implementation of surgical treatment of lung diseases. In the Soviet Union, 80% to 90% of patients undergoing surgical removal of diseased lungs can be cured.
　　The Soviet Union's tuberculosis control work has greatly developed since the October Revolution. In Tsarist Russia, there were only four medical institutions for lung diseases and two hundred sanatorium beds. Last year, the number of medical institutions for lung diseases nationwide reached 5,300, and this year the number of beds in lung disease sanatoriums has reached 141,000. In addition, there are sixteen large-scale lung disease research institutes across the country, and many medical school laboratories and other medical institutions are engaged in research on the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.
　　This year, the Soviet government allocated 120 million rubles for medical expenses for patients. The price of drugs for treating lung diseases in the Soviet Union was recently reduced by 50%.

　　在最近十年到十五年内
    苏联将消灭肺结核病
    新华社莫斯科26日电  苏联将在最近十年到十五年内在全国消灭肺结核病。这是苏联卫生部副部长霍穆托夫最近在全苏第六次结核防治工作者代表大会上说的。
    苏联由于广泛实行了接种防痨疫苗、及时对居民进行肺部检查和用有效的药物治疗，去年城市居民的肺病死亡率比1949年减少了70％，患病率减少了43％。现在城市的每个区都有爱克斯光透视设备。今后苏联每个居民至少要在两、三个月内进行一次肺部检查。
    苏联还广泛采用抗菌疗法。这种疗法为实行肺病的外科治疗创造了条件。在苏联，实行病变肺部的切除手术的患者，有80％到90％都可以痊愈。
    苏联的结核病防治事业是在十月革命以后大大发展起来的。在沙皇俄国只有四个医疗肺病的机构和两百张疗养床位。去年全国肺病的医疗机构已经达到五千三百所，今年肺病疗养院中的床位已经达到十四万一千张。此外，全国有十六所大规模的肺病研究所，许多医学院的研究室和其他医疗机构在从事防治肺结核的研究工作。
    今年苏联政府拨出了一亿二千万卢布作为医疗患者的费用。苏联的医疗肺病的药物价格不久前降低了50％。
