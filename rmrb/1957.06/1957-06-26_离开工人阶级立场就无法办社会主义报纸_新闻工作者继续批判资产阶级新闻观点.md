Xinhua News Agency, 25th: At the journalism symposium today, the anti-socialist activities and speeches of bourgeois rightists in journalism were further criticized.

　　Sun Dianwei and He Gengxin of the China News Agency successively exposed Zheng Baitao's words and deeds. Sun Dianwei said that Zheng Baitao had many reactionary fallacies within the China News Agency. He agreed with Zhang Bojun's remarks, advocated the implementation of a bicameral system in China, and advocated running newspapers for the opposition. After the anti-Party activities of Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, and Chu Anping were exposed, he still defended them, saying that the saying "Party's world" was correct. He believed that fixed interest was not exploitation, not even unearned income, but the same as interest on deposits in banks. He believes that the current rebuttals of rightists in newspapers are bureaucratic and dogmatic practices. He advocated running a "fellow traveler news agency" without the leadership of the Communist Party; when comrades from the China News Agency criticized him, he said that this was the success of the Communist Party's policy of fooling the people, and he called these people thugs. He Gengxin said: Zheng Baitao verbally touted that news has no class character, but he was very class-conscious in his work at the China News Agency. After Zhang Bojun's so-called fallacy of a "political design institute" was put forward, he advocated sending out the news immediately. He immediately compiled and issued Li Kangnian's suggestion of a fixed interest rate for twenty years, but he did not issue it when Li later withdrew this suggestion. He sighed when he saw the newspapers' anti-rightist remarks, and he promoted the reactionary work "Little Words in the Flower Garden" everywhere. The manuscripts he wrote for foreign use were almost the same as those written by bourgeois news agency reporters, one-sidedly saying that we had economic difficulties and insufficient raw materials. He was actually scolding us severely rather than mildly. He claimed that news should serve all classes as universally as language, but in reality, he insisted on anti-socialist views.

　　Subsequently, Wang Yunsheng, Yuan Yuming, Kong Zhaokai, and Liu Kelin, the main responsible persons of the Ta Kung Pao, made a joint written speech at the meeting entitled "How to Run a Socialist Newspaper." In their speech, they explained that newspapers in socialist countries must be different from those in capitalist countries. They said that the six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" are the standards for our newspaper operation, among which the main one is the leadership of the Party, and leaving the leadership of the Party is opposing socialism. They said that newspapers are tools of class struggle, and one cannot run a socialist newspaper by departing from the standpoint of the working class. They also talked about how the Party spirit and the people's spirit of newspapers are completely consistent, and there is no such thing as the people's spirit without the Party spirit; freedom of the press and objectivity do not mean reflecting everything, which is impossible. It must have choices, which requires a standpoint. They also examined the bourgeois ideas still existing in the news viewpoints of the comrades of the Ta Kung Pao, such as the recently published "Frustrated Interview in Inner Mongolia" and the report on the Beijing vegetable free market, which were manifestations of this kind of thinking. They expressed that they would conduct a good examination within the newspaper office and overcome this kind of thinking.

　　Xu Zhucheng, the president and editor-in-chief of Wenhui Daily, also spoke at the meeting today. He said that Wenhui Daily had made serious mistakes in the past period. The criticisms from all sides, especially the articles in the People's Daily, awakened us and saved us from a dangerous path. We are examining our mistakes. I have learned the following lessons from this serious mistake: one must not forget for a moment that newspapers are tools of class struggle; one must not leave the leadership of the Party for a moment; educators must first be educated, and as people's journalists, they must first step up their study and strive for self-transformation. We believe that we will be able to fundamentally correct our mistakes and run the newspaper well under the leadership of the Party. In his speech, he said that he had not said that Wenhui Daily had received instructions from Luo Longji. He also said that Wenhui Daily had not been used by Luo Longji and others.

　　Jin Zhonghua, the president of the Shanghai Xinwen Daily, exposed the activities of rightists attacking the Xinwen Daily at the meeting. He said that after the National Propaganda Conference, Lu Yi returned to Shanghai and wanted to send reporters to release articles nationwide; in Shanghai, they held a political and legal forum, exaggerating the shortcomings in the people's political and legal work and negating the dignity of the entire people's law. During this period, rightists such as Wang Zaoshi, Sun Dayu, Xu Zhongnian, and Lu Mang always wanted the newspaper to publish their erroneous remarks in full without changing a word. Lu Yi even exaggerated everywhere in exposing contradictions, stirring up an evil wind and inciting readers. Jin Zhonghua said that, learning from these lessons, we can only run the newspaper well by repelling the rightists' attacks. Jin Zhonghua also criticized Wang Zhong's erroneous view of the commodity nature of news and Zheng Baitao's erroneous view of news being above class. He said that Zheng Baitao's mild criticism was actually genuine criticism disguised as help.

　　Zhang Jude of Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Huang Zhuoming of Guangming Daily also spoke at today's meeting. Huang Zhuoming said that Xu Zhucheng had said that Luo Longji had given instructions to Wenhui Daily. He had heard Xu Zhucheng personally say this at a gathering of members of the China Democratic League from Guangming Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Wenhui Daily in Beijing last year. He felt very strange about Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu's denial.

　　The symposium will be adjourned tomorrow and will continue the day after tomorrow.

　　离开工人阶级立场就无法办社会主义报纸
    新闻工作者继续批判资产阶级新闻观点
    新华社25日讯  新闻工作座谈会今天继续批判资产阶级右派分子在新闻工作中的反社会主义的活动和言论。
    中国新闻社的孙殿伟、何耕新相继对郑白涛的言行进行了揭露。孙殿伟说，郑白涛在中国新闻社内就有许多反动的谬论。他同意章伯钧的言论，主张中国要实行两院制，主张办反对派的报纸。在章伯钧、章乃器、储安平等人的反党活动被揭露后，他仍然替他们辩护，他说“党天下”的说法是对的，他认为定息不是剥削甚至不是不劳而获而是和在银行里存款的利息一样。他认为目前报纸上对右派分子的驳斥是官僚主义、教条主义的作法。他主张办“同人通讯社”，不要共产党领导；中国新闻社的同志批评他，他说这是共产党的愚民政策的成功，他并把这些人称作打手。何耕新说：郑白涛口头标榜新闻没有阶级性，但是他在中国新闻社工作中却非常有阶级性。章伯钧的所谓“政治设计院”的谬论提出后，他主张马上发消息。李康年的定息二十年的建议他立刻编发了，李后来撤销这建议，他却不发。看到报纸反右派的言论他就唉声叹气，对反动作品“花丛小语”他就到处向人宣传。他所写的对外用的稿子几乎和资产阶级通讯社记者写的一样，片面地说我们经济困难、原料不足。他对我们实际是大骂而不是小骂。他口称新闻要像语言一样普遍地为各阶级服务，实际他却是坚持反社会主义观点。
    接着大公报的主要负责人王芸生、袁毓明、孔昭恺、刘克林等四人在会上作了题为“怎样办一张社会主义报纸”的联合书面发言。在发言里他们说明社会主义国家的报纸一定要和资本主义国家的不同。他们说毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中提出的六项政治标准，就是我们办报的标准，其中主要的是党的领导，离开党的领导就是反对社会主义。他们说报纸是阶级斗争的工具，离开了工人阶级的立场就无法办社会主义的报纸。他们还谈到报纸的党性与人民性是完全一致的，没有党性就说不上人民性；新闻自由和客观并不是把一切事情都反映出来，这是不可能的，它必须有选择，这就得有立场。他们还检查了大公报的同人在新闻观点上还存在着的资产阶级思想，如最近发表的“内蒙古采访扑空记”和关于北京蔬菜自由市场的报道就是这种思想的表现，他们表示要很好在报社内检查和克服这种思想。
    文汇报的社长兼总编辑徐铸成今天也在会上讲了话。他说文汇报在过去一段时期内犯了严重的错误，各方面的批评，特别是人民日报的文章唤醒了我们，把我们从危险的道路上挽救过来。我们正在检查我们的错误。我从这次严重的错误中得到了以下的教训：一时一刻也不能忘了报纸是阶级斗争的工具；一时一刻也不能离开党的领导；教育者必须先受教育，作为人民的新闻工作者首先必须加紧学习，努力自我改造。我们相信我们一定能够从根本上改正错误，在党的领导下，把报纸办好。他在发言中说，他没有说过文汇报曾接受罗隆基的指示的话，他还说，文汇报并没有被罗隆基等所利用。
    上海新闻日报社长金仲华在会上揭露右派分子向新闻日报进攻的活动。他说，全国宣传会议以后，陆诒回到上海就要派记者到全国大放；在上海搞政法座谈会，大肆夸张人民政法工作中的缺点，否定整个人民法律的尊严。在这一时期，右派分子如王造时、孙大雨、徐仲年、鲁莽等人总是要报纸一字不动地全文照登他们的错误言论。陆诒就更是在揭露矛盾中处处夸大，掀起一股歪风，煽动读者。金仲华说，吸取这些教训，我们只有打退右派的进攻，报纸才可以办好。金仲华还批评王中的新闻有商品性和郑白涛的新闻超阶级的错误观点。他说，郑白涛的小骂大帮忙，实际上是真骂假帮忙。
    今天会上发言的还有南京新华日报的张居德和光明日报的黄卓明。黄卓明说，徐铸成曾说过罗隆基曾经给过文汇报指示，这是他在去年一次光明日报、大公报的民盟盟员和文汇报在北京的民盟盟员联欢会上，听徐铸成亲自说的，他对徐铸成、浦熙修的否认感到非常奇怪。
    座谈会明天休会，后天继续举行。
