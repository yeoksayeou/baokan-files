　　Difficult-to-Handle Files
　　The library of Harvard University in the United States has a large pile of secret documents from the Second World War. It occupies a room seventy feet wide and one hundred feet long, and costs $1,200 a year in storage fees. The school authorities have repeatedly submitted reports to the government and the Department of Defense, requesting that these files, which are not allowed to be viewed, be processed. Due to the complicated procedures of the government in handling problems, although this matter has been raised for ten years, it still has not been resolved, and the instructions received are: these documents should not be returned to the government, cannot be burned, and even less can they be thrown away.

　　难处理的文件
    美国哈佛大学的图书馆里堆了一大堆第二次世界大战时期的秘密文件，它占用了一间七十英尺宽一百英尺长的房间，每年要花一千二百美元的保管费。学校当局曾一再打报告给政府和国防部，请求处理这些不准许看的文件。由于政府处理问题的手续繁杂，虽然这件事已提了十年了，但仍然没有得到解答，而得到的指示：这些文件不用交还政府，不能烧毁，更不能丢掉。
