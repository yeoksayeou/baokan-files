Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 27th: Tianjin's local industrial output value for the first half of this year will exceed the 1952 output value by more than 15%. This marks a significant development in Tianjin, one of China's original industrial bases, during the First Five-Year Plan.

Materials provided by relevant departments show that by the end of last year, Tianjin's gross industrial output had reached 106.77% of the Five-Year Plan target. It is projected that by the end of this year, it will exceed the Five-Year Plan by 14.7%. Among the products with targets set by the central government, most products such as steel, steel materials, and cotton cloth have completed the Five-Year Plan. By the end of this year, major products such as steel will exceed the plan by 38%, steel materials will exceed it by 1.8 times, automobile tires will exceed it by 53%, and forging equipment will exceed it by about one time.

Tianjin's heavy and electromechanical industries, developed from the original dilapidated foundations, have supported more than one hundred construction projects across the country in the past five years. The electromechanical industry, which manufactures means of production, could only produce fifty-four types of products in 1952, but now it has increased to more than eight hundred types. Last year alone, it manufactured more than one hundred new products for key enterprises such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel. Products such as machine tools, boilers, bridge cranes, medium-sized forging equipment, drilling machines, road rollers, belt conveyors, and 10,000-volt high-voltage giant cables were previously impossible to produce. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission, the city's industry has successfully trial-produced 1,950 new products in four years, and it is expected that this number will increase to more than 2,100 by the end of this year. The achievements of the dye chemical industry are the most prominent. In 1949, each dye factory could only produce one product, vulcanized blue, but now it has increased to 115 types, and 20 new products are in trial production. Among these hundred-plus products, 14 have reached or exceeded the world's most advanced quality standards, and more than 30 dyes are exported to countries such as India, Pakistan, and Egypt. The intermediate product, alpha-naphthylamine, is also exported to Switzerland.

Tianjin's daily necessities are distributed throughout North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and other vast regions, and the quantity has greatly increased. According to statistics from various companies and purchasing stations in the commercial system, the volume of goods shipped from Tianjin to various regions has increased by 91.9% compared to 1952, exceeding the highest historical level. The output value of light industry and textile industry has more than doubled in the Five-Year Plan, and more than 1,200 new products have been successfully trial-produced. These include not only general daily necessities but also high-end products such as watches, cellophane, and printed overcoats. During the Five-Year Plan, investments in cotton textile, knitting, printing and dyeing, rubber, and paper-making industries accounted for more than 28%. The newly built Tianjin Knitting Factory, the largest in China, can produce more than 1.84 million dozens of vests, undershirts, fleece sweaters and pants, and cotton knitwear, accounting for more than 62.65% of Tianjin's total knitwear production. Currently, the output value of large-scale enterprises in the city accounts for 98% of the total output value, and the output value of modern industry reaches 91%.

    年底将超过五年计划指标14.7％
    据新华社天津27日电  天津市地方工业今年上半年的产值，将超过1952年产值15％以上。这标志着我国原有工业基地之一的天津市，在第一个五年计划中有了巨大发展。
    从有关部门提供的材料表明：早在去年底，天津市的工业总产值就达到五年计划指标的106.77％，预计到今年底可以超过五年计划14.7％。在中央下达有指标的产品中，有钢、钢材、棉布等大部分产品完成了五年计划。到今年底，主要产品如钢将超过计划38％，钢材超过一点八倍，汽车外胎超过53％，锻压设备将超过一倍左右。
    从原有破旧基础发展起来的天津重工业和机电工业，在五年中支援了全国一百多个建设工程。制造生产资料的机电工业在1952年只能生产五十四种产品，而现在已经增加到八百多种，光是去年为第一汽车制造厂、鞍钢等重点企业制造的新产品就有一百多种。机床、锅炉、桥式起重机、中型锻压设备、钻探机、压路机、皮带运输机、一万伏特高压巨型电缆等产品都是过去所不能生产的。据天津市计划委员会统计，全市工业在四年中共试制成功了一千九百五十种新产品，预计到今年底可以增加到两千一百多种。染料化学工业的成就最为突出。在1949年各染料厂只能生产硫化青一种产品，而现在已经增加到一百一十五种，还有二十种新产品正在试制中。在这一百多种产品中，有十四种已经达到或超过了世界最先进的质量标准，而且有三十多种染料出口到印度、巴基斯坦、埃及等国，中间体甲萘胺还出口到瑞士。
    天津出产的生活必需品，遍及华北、西北、东北、内蒙古等广大地区，数量大大增加。据商业系统的各公司和采购站的统计，从天津运往各地的商品比1952年增加了91.9％，超过历史上最高水平。轻工业和纺织工业在五年计划中产值增加了一倍以上，试制成功的新产品达一千二百多种，其中，不但有一般生活必需品，还有手表、玻璃纸、烤花大衣呢等高级产品。在五年计划中投资于棉纺织、针织、印染、橡胶和造纸工业的资金占28％多，新建的我国规模最大的天津市针织厂每年可产背心、汗衫、绒衣裤、棉毛衫裤等一百八十四万多打，占天津市全部针织品产量的62.65％以上。现在，全市大型企业产值已占全部产值的98％，现代化工业的产值达91％。
