Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko stated in a statement today, questioning the U.S. government: "Is it using the London disarmament negotiations as a smokescreen to conceal America's attempts to continue and intensify its arms expansion?"

He pointed out that if this were not the case, then there would not have been the aggressive speech made by General Norstad, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, at a closed session of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee not long ago. In this speech, Norstad spoke about the military plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and threatened to "attack the Soviet Union from all directions" from American military bases abroad and "eliminate everything in Russia that has any military significance."

Gromyko condemned Norstad's speech. His statement was made at a press conference held at the Soviet Foreign Ministry building today.

Gromyko said that during the London disarmament negotiations, especially after the Soviet Union put forward its new proposals, the possibility of reaching an agreement on certain partial measures in disarmament has emerged. Under these circumstances, it seems that all participating countries in the disarmament negotiations must be particularly careful and patient to help maintain an atmosphere conducive to the progress of the negotiations.

Gromyko said that therefore, if the United States, a participating country in the disarmament negotiations, truly wants to promote the necessary agreements among the major powers, then aggressive and provocative speeches like Norstad's would not occur.

Gromyko believes that Norstad's speech is not the ordinary ravings of a rash general, but deliberately provocative remarks, hoping to disrupt the international situation, promote the "Cold War", and incite war frenzy, thereby helping the factory owners of military factories to reap huge profits from military orders.

Gromyko said that Norstad's speech contradicts the claim that American military bases in foreign territories in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world are for "defensive purposes." It once again proves that the idea that some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization believe that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not pursuing aggressive purposes is unfounded.

### 葛罗米柯斥美国无心裁军  指出诺斯塔德好战叫嚣旨在扰乱国际局势

　　葛罗米柯斥美国无心裁军
    指出诺斯塔德好战叫嚣旨在扰乱国际局势
    新华社莫斯科25日电  苏联外交部长葛罗米柯今天在一篇声明中问美国政府：它“是不是把伦敦裁军谈判当做一个幌子，用来掩饰美国继续和加紧扩充军备的企图？”
    他指出，如果不是这样的话，那么就不会出现北大西洋集团武装部队最高统帅诺斯塔德将军不久前在美国参议院外交委员会的一次秘密会议上所作的侵略性发言。诺斯塔德在这次发言中谈到了北大西洋集团的军事计划，并且曾经威胁说，将从美国的国外军事基地“四面八方来进攻苏联”、“消灭俄国所有有一点军事意义的东西”。
    葛罗米柯斥责了诺斯塔德的发言，他的声明是在今天在苏联外交部大楼举行的一个记者招待会上发表的。
    葛罗米柯说，在伦敦裁军谈判过程中，特别是在苏联提出自己的新建议以后，在裁军方面出现了就某些局部措施达成协议的可能性。在这种情况下，看来，裁军谈判的所有参加国必须特别谨慎和耐心以促进维持有利于谈判进展的气氛。
    葛罗米柯说，因此，裁军谈判参加国的美国如果真正想促使各大国达成必要的协定，那么就不会出现类似诺斯塔德那样的侵略性和挑拨性的发言。
    葛罗米柯认为，诺斯塔德这个发言不是轻举妄动的将军普普通通的呓语，而是蓄意挑拨的言论，希望借此搅乱国际局势，鼓吹“冷战”，煽起战争狂，从而帮助军工厂的厂主从军事定货中捞取巨额利润。
    葛罗米柯说，诺斯塔德的发言是同硬说美国在欧洲、亚洲和世界其他地区外国领土上的军事基地是为了“防御目的”的说法相矛盾的。它再一次证明，北大西洋公约组织成员国有些人认为北大西洋公约组织并非追求侵略目的的想法是毫无根据的。
