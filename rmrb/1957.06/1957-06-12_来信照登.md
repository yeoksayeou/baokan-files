Letters to the Editor

　　People's Daily Editorial Department:
    After reading Comrade Lin Yuan's article "Let's Hear the Editors' Voices Too" on page 7 of your newspaper on May 18th, I felt compelled to write this letter to you.
    On May 4th, I participated in a symposium of the 11th group of the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference. When discussing editors' revisions to writers' manuscripts, I relayed Comrade Zhou Yang's speech at the Beijing Creative Planning Conference in mid-March, advocating that editors should let writers with a certain writing history be responsible for their own writing and not make any modifications. On the 9th, Wenhui Daily published Comrade Chu Yukun's "Summary of the Symposium of the 11th Group of the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference," which included the sentence: "The old writer Wang Xiyan said in a decisive tone: 'Once someone has become a recognized writer, the editor cannot modify his work. I personally believe that not even a single word should be modified.'" After reading this, I felt quite uncomfortable. Firstly, the title "old writer" made me sensitive and suggested a sarcasm about my lack of progress. I feel that I am still in the exploratory stage of writing and learning. Secondly, describing my tone as "decisive," coupled with phrases such as "recognized writer" and "not even a single word should be modified," made my attitude seem extreme, which is not entirely consistent with my original words and feelings. However, after all, that was someone else's description, not my formal article, and the readers should have been able to tell at a glance, so I did not request the newspaper to correct it. Unexpectedly, Comrade Lin Yuan's article quoted the above passage, even adding emphasis, and further accused me of being "arrogant" and "unassuming"! Comrade Lin Yuan's citation and judgment were really shocking to me! Didn't he see that the title "old writer" and the adjective "decisive" were from someone else's pen? Didn't he even think that excerpts from a person's speech might not always fully reflect the original intention? Moreover, my speech was aimed at the specific circumstances at that time and place.
    Wang Xiyan, Shanghai, May 19, 1957

　　来信照登
　　人民日报编辑部：
    读到您报5月18日第七版林元同志“也请听听编辑的声音”一文，使我不能不给您处写这封信。
    5月4日，我参加上海市政协第十一小组的座谈会，谈到编辑修改作家的稿子时，我转述了3月中旬周扬同志在北京创作规划会议上的发言，主张编辑对有一定写作历史的作家的稿子，应使作家自负文责，不必加以修改。到了9日，文汇报上登出储玉坤同志的“上海市政协第十一小组座谈记要”一文，内有“老作家王西彦用斩钉截铁的口气说：‘既已成为公认的作家，编辑就不能修改他的作品。我个人主张，连一个字也不能修改’”的话，我看了后，很有些不痛快：一则，称呼我为什么“老作家”，使我敏感到有讥刺我不长进的意思，我觉得自己在写作学习上刚处于摸索阶段；再则，形容我的口气为“斩钉截铁”，再和“公认的作家”“连一个字也不能修改”等等的语句连在一起，便显出我态度的偏激来了，跟我原来的说话和心情是并不完全符合的。不过，那究竟是别人的描叙，不是我正式的文章，读者应该是一看就知的，所以我也就没有请求报纸给我更正。不料在林元同志的文章里，竟引用了上述那段描叙，还加上加重点，并进而判给我“自大”“不谦逊”的罪名！林元同志这种引用和判断，实在太使我吃惊了！难道他竟没有看出“老作家”的称呼和“斩钉截铁”的形容词，是出于别人的手笔吗？更没有想到，摘记一个人的发言中的片言只语，有时是可能不尽符合原意的吗？何况我的发言，是针对着当时当地的特殊情况的呢？
