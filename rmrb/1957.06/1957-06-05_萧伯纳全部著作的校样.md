	Proofs of All of George Bernard Shaw's Works
	Twenty-eight seemingly worn and dirty books turned out to be bound copies of proofs of works by the British writer George Bernard Shaw.
	These items were discovered in a three-story red brick house in St. Lawrence, near London. Shaw had lived there for many years and died there.
	It is said that Shaw had a peculiar habit of always asking the publisher for the final proofs of his works and having them bound. In these proofs, Shaw not only made many corrections but also wrote some interesting comments to the publisher.
	The recently discovered twenty-eight proofs almost include all of Shaw's works and are therefore considered to be of high value.

### 萧伯纳全部著作的校样

    萧伯纳全部著作的校样
    二十八本看来是破旧肮脏的书，原来却是英国文学家萧伯纳的作品校样的装订本。
    这批东西是在伦敦附近圣劳伦斯村的一座三层楼的红砖房子内发现的。萧伯纳曾经在那里住过很多年，并且死在那里。
    据说，萧伯纳有个古怪脾气，就是每次都要向出版者要回他作品的最后校样，并且把它装订起来。在这些校样上，萧伯纳除作了许多改正外，还写了一些对出版者有趣的批语。
    最近发现的二十八本校样几乎就包括了萧伯纳的全部的著作，因此被认为是有很高价值的。
