　　High-Concentration "1605" Rapid Spraying to Control Cotton Aphids
    According to Xinhua News Agency, entomologist Qi Zhaosheng conducted high-concentration rapid spraying experiments with "1605" in cotton fields in the Xinxiang and Zhengzhou pest control and yield protection demonstration areas in late May this year, with good results. The kill rate in the Zhengzhou demonstration area reached 100%, and in the Xinxiang demonstration area, the insecticidal effect was over 97% fourteen hours after application. The control time lasted for seven to ten days. On average, each person could treat fifteen mu per day. The experiment also proved that "1605" does indeed have a penetrating effect. Applying 40 jin of 0.05% concentration "1605" solution per mu, directly sprayed on the cotton leaves, can kill the insects on the back of the leaves. This high-concentration rapid spraying method has high insecticidal efficiency, fast speed, and long control time, making it suitable for use in large-area cotton fields.
    Last year, when Henan Province tested "1605" for the prevention and control of cotton aphids, the prepared diluted solution was sprayed on the insects on the back of the cotton leaves. This method was not only slow, but also easily missed plants and leaves. The insecticidal rate only reached 70% to 90%, and each person could treat a maximum of five mu per day. The success of this trial using high-concentration rapid spraying to control cotton aphids provides a more powerful guarantee for the future prevention and control of cotton aphids, cotton red spiders, and other pests.
    Qi Zhaosheng is the director of the Insect Research Group of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute. He went to the Henan large-area cotton pest control and yield protection demonstration area specifically to conduct on-site pest control experiments and provide in-depth guidance to large-area pest control work during the production process.

### 高浓度“一六○五”快速喷射治棉蚜

　　高浓度“一六○五”快速喷射治棉蚜
    据新华社讯　昆虫学者齐兆生今年5月下旬，在新乡、郑州防虫保产示范区的棉田里，用“一六○五”作高浓度快速喷射治虫试验，结果良好。郑州示范区杀虫率达百分之百，新乡示范区在施药后十四小时，杀虫效果在97％以上。控制时间达七至十天。平均每人每天可治十五亩。试验还证明“一六○五”确实有渗透作用。每亩用四十斤“一六○五”的0.05％浓度药液，直接喷撒在棉叶上，就可杀死叶子被面的虫。这种高浓度快速喷射法，杀虫效率高、速度快、控制时间长，适合在大面积棉田上使用。
    去年，河南省在试用“一六○五”防治棉蚜虫时，是将配好的稀释液喷撒在棉叶背面的虫身上。这样作，不但速度慢，而且也容易漏棵、漏叶。杀虫率只达70％至90％，每人每天最多治五亩。这次试用高浓度快速喷射防治棉蚜虫的成功，就为今后防治棉蚜、棉红蜘蛛等虫害提供了更有力的保证。
    齐兆生是华北农业科学研究所昆虫研究组主任，他到河南大面积棉花防虫保产示范区，是专门作实地防虫试验和深入生产过程指导大面积治虫工作的。
