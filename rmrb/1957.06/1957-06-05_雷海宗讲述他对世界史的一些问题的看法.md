    Lei Haizong, a professor in the History Department of Nankai University, delivered a speech titled "Periodization of World History and Some Issues in Ancient and Medieval World History" at a forum jointly organized by several academic groups in Tianjin on the 2nd, addressing academics and professors and students from universities.

    Professor Lei Haizong began with the development of production tools, arguing that since the emergence of humankind, the development of production tools has gone through four major stages: the first stage being the Stone Age, the second the Bronze Age, the third the Iron Age, and the fourth the Machine Age. The first stage is the primitive society, which is not disputed; the fourth stage is the capitalist society, followed by socialist society, which is also not disputed. The problem lies in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, that is, the period of class society before the emergence of capitalism. He believes that the classical works discuss this issue very little, with Marx being the only one who discussed it relatively systematically. Based on the materials available to European science at the time, Marx pointed out in the preface to "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy": "In broad terms, the Asiatic mode of production, the ancient mode of production, the feudal mode of production, and the modern bourgeois mode of production can be seen as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society." Engels and Lenin also mentioned this in several places. They generally did not mention the Asiatic mode of production, because not only was too little known about this period a hundred years ago, but even fifty years ago the knowledge was still unclear. For example, most of the materials we now have about ancient Egypt and India were not available a hundred years ago, and European scholars were completely ignorant of ancient Chinese history a hundred years ago. Today, we have more materials on the Asiatic mode of production. Therefore, he believes that this issue should be reconsidered based on new materials.

    Professor Lei Haizong pointed out that according to past general practice, the period of the Bronze Age and the early part of the Iron Age was often referred to as slave society, and the later part of the Iron Age was classified as feudal society. He believes that such a division is unscientific, because it treats periods with basically the same production tools as two social stages, and treats periods with two different types of production tools as one social stage, which violates the principle that production tools play a decisive role in historical development. Thus, it is only in words that the importance of production tools is acknowledged, while their importance is neglected in specific issues. As for the fact that productive forces also have another aspect—people with certain production experience and technology who use production tools to produce material goods—he believes that this does not need to be overemphasized in historical research, because many of the experiences and technologies of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age are unknown today.

    Based on the materials he has, Professor Lei Haizong analyzed the production tools and social features of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, explaining that the slave system did not exist in world history. He took Babylon, where the Bronze Age developed to a relatively high level, as an example: At that time, in Babylon, in addition to some land being directly controlled by the king, another part was privately owned, the land rent system was quite common, there was a lot of free labor, and slave labor was not important. The boundary between slaves and free people was not strict; slaves could not only marry free people, but also nobles. Masters could not kill slaves at will, and slaves were mostly from outside the tribe. Debt slaves from the tribe could return home after three years of labor, which was actually a way of paying off debts. At that time, the kings, nobles, and aristocrats who kept slaves regarded slaves as members of their families. In Latin, the original meaning of the word "family" in Rome included slaves. Most of the slaves at that time were a parasitic class, and only a few slaves were engaged in production. Therefore, if this system is called a slave society, then the definition of slave society needs to be reconsidered. Lei Haizong then talked about the Iron Age. Although slavery developed, slaves did not occupy as important a position in production as is generally imagined. This was the case not only in most parts of Greece, but even in Athens, which had a typical slave system with nearly two hundred years of history, slaves did not occupy an important position in agricultural production. At that time, there were no slave uprisings, no struggles between slaves and free people, and no violent struggles between slaves and rulers. Professor Lei Haizong believes that only the situation in Rome was an exception in world history. Rome was constantly invading other countries at that time, and captured a large number of people each time. Therefore, there was a large-scale slave system. This situation could only arise in maritime countries.

    After analyzing the situation in Greece, Rome, and other countries, Lei Haizong put forward his views on the social nature of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. He said: We have always respected Marx. Why do we ignore Marx's conclusion on this key issue? The term "Asiatic mode of production" proposed by Marx can be discarded, because this is not a question of location; it can be called the Asiatic mode of production, or it can be called other modes of production, but this is an era, an independent social stage, fundamentally different from the later classical society (later called slave society). "Slave society" is the first part of the Iron Age. I advocate still using the term used by Marx a hundred years ago, calling it classical society, not slave society, because a highly developed slave system only existed in Athens and Rome for a very short period. When explaining that the use of slaves should not be confused with slave society, he gave an example: The first time in human history that slaves were used in large numbers was in Rome; the second time was when Western European countries used Africans as slaves in large numbers, and this was already in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. If this is said to be a remnant of the slave system, there cannot be such a large remnant. This can also explain that in the history of the world, there is no social stage called the slave system.

### 雷海宗讲述他对世界史的一些问题的看法

    雷海宗讲述他对世界史的一些问题的看法
    本报特约新华社专稿　南开大学历史系教授雷海宗2日在天津市几个学术团体联合举办的争鸣讲坛上，以“世界史分期和世界上古、中古史的一些问题”为题，向学术界和高等学校的教授、学生等发表了讲演。
    雷海宗教授首先从生产工具的发展说起，他认为从有人类以来，生产工具的发展有四大阶段：第一阶段为石器时代，第二阶段为铜器时代，第三阶段为铁器时代，第四阶段为机器时代。第一阶段是原始社会，没有争论；第四阶段是资本主义社会，后来是社会主义社会，也没有争论：问题在于铜器时代和铁器时代，也就是资本主义出现以前阶级社会这一段。他认为经典作品对这个问题谈的很少，唯一较有系统地谈过的是马克思。马克思根据当时欧洲科学所掌握的材料，在“政治经济学批判”序言中指出：“大体说来，亚细亚生产方式、古典生产方式、封建生产方式以及现代资产阶级生产方式，可以看成为社会经济形态发展中的几个演进时代。”恩格斯、列宁也在几个地方谈到这个问题。他们对亚细亚生产方式一般的不提了。这是因为不仅在一百年前关于这一段知道得太少，就是在五十年前知道得也不清楚。比如现在掌握的埃及、印度上古的材料，绝大部分在一百年前没有，欧洲学者一百年前对中国上古史则等于完全不知道。而今天掌握的亚细亚生产方式的材料比较多。因此，他认为应该根据新的材料重新考虑这个问题。
    雷海宗教授指出：按照过去一般习惯，划分社会阶段时往往把铜器时代和铁器时代的前一段称为奴隶社会，把铁器时代的后一段划分为封建社会。他认为这样划分是不科学的，因为这样把生产工具基本上相同的时期看成是两个社会阶段，两种不同的生产工具时期看成是一个社会阶段，是违反生产工具在历史发展中起决定作用的原理的。这样就是只在口头上承认生产工具重要，具体问题上又忽视了它的重要性。至于说生产力还有另外一个方面——有一定生产经验和技术并使用生产工具生产物质资料的人，他认为在研究历史时不必过分强调，因为在铜器时代和铁器时代，许多经验、技术，今天没人知道。
    雷海宗教授根据他所掌握的材料，对铜器时代和铁器时代的生产工具、社会面貌进行了分析，说明奴隶制度在世界史上是不存在的。他以铜器时代发展相当高的巴比伦为例：当时巴比伦除了一部分土地由王直接掌握外，另外一部分是私有制，土地租佃制相当普遍，自由身份劳动很多，奴隶劳动反不重要。奴隶、自由人界限不严格，奴隶不但可以和自由人结婚，还可以和贵族结婚。主人对奴隶不能生杀，奴隶多是外来的，本族的债奴劳动三年后仍可回家，这实际上是一种还债的方式。当时保有奴隶的王公、贵族是把奴隶作为他们的家族成员。在罗马的“家族”二字，拉丁文的原意就是包括奴隶在内的。当时的奴隶大部分是寄生阶级，人民中只有少数的奴隶从事生产。因此，如果把这种制度叫奴隶社会，那末，对奴隶社会的定义就需要重新考虑。雷海宗接着谈到铁器时代，奴隶制虽然有了发展，但奴隶在生产中所占地位并不似一般想像的那样重要。不仅在希腊绝大地方是如此，即或是有着近二百年历史的典型奴隶制度的雅典，奴隶在农业生产上也不占重要地位。当时没有奴隶起义，没有奴隶与自由民间的斗争，也没有奴隶与统制者的剧烈斗争。雷海宗教授认为只有罗马的情况在世界史上是一个例外。罗马当时经常向外侵略，每次俘虏大量的人，因此，才有了大规模的奴隶制度，这种情况只有海上国家才有可能产生。
    雷海宗在分析了希腊、罗马等国情况后，提出他对铜器时代和铁器时代的社会性质的看法。他说：我们一直尊重马克思，为什么在这个关键问题上忽视马克思这个论断？马克思提的亚细亚生产方式这个名词可以不用。因为这不是个地点问题，叫亚细亚生产方式也可以，叫其他生产方式也可以，但这是一个时代，是个独立的社会阶段，与后来的古典社会（后来叫奴隶社会）根本不同。“奴隶社会”也就是铁器时代前一段，我主张仍用马克思一百年前用的名词，叫古典社会，不叫奴隶社会。因为高度发展的奴隶制度只在雅典、罗马很短时期有。他在说明使用奴隶与奴隶社会不能混为一谈时举例说：在人类史上第一次大量使用奴隶是罗马；第二次是西欧国家大量使用非洲人作奴隶，而这已是十六、十七、十八世纪的事情，如果说这是奴隶制度的残余，也不能有这么大的残余，这也可以说明就全世界的历史来说，没有奴隶制度这个社会阶段。
