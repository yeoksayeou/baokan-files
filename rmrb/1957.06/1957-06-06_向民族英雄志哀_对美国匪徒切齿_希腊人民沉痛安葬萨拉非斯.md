Xinhua News Agency, Athens, June 3rd, according to TASS: The funeral of General Sarafis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Greek anti-German forces, who was killed by an American military vehicle, was held solemnly in Athens on June 2nd.

　　From six o'clock in the morning, the streets of Athens were full of people holding flowers and carrying wreaths, surging like a tide from all directions towards the central cathedral.

　　After the memorial service, the funeral procession proceeded to the cemetery. Tens of thousands of people bid a final farewell to General Sarafis, the famous fighter for Greek freedom and independence, and the leader of the Greek National Liberation Army.

　　The "Dawn Daily" of June 2nd wrote that all the Greek people understand that although Sarafis is dead, things are not over. No one can deceive the people into believing that there is nothing hidden behind the murderers' atrocities. Every patriot expresses indignation at those who complacently deprive the nation of its rights and independence. Due to the death of General Sarafis, the issue of American extraterritoriality in Greece and the stationing of Americans in Greece has been raised again.

    向民族英雄志哀　对美国匪徒切齿
    希腊人民沉痛安葬萨拉非斯
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社雅典3日讯：被美国军车撞死的前希腊抗德军总司令萨拉非斯将军的葬礼，6月2日在雅典隆重举行。
    清晨六点钟起，雅典城里满街都是手拿鲜花和抬着花圈的人，像潮流一般从四面八方涌向中央大礼拜堂。
    在追悼会之后，送葬的行列向墓地进发。成千上万的人最后送别了争取希腊自由独立的著名战士、希腊民族解放军的领导人萨拉非斯将军。
      6月2日的“黎明日报”写道全希腊人民明白，虽然萨拉非斯死了，但是事情还没有结束。谁也骗不了人民，硬说在谋害者的暴行后面没隐藏任何东西。每个爱国者都对那些心安理得地夺去了民族的权利和独立的人表示愤慨。由于萨拉非斯将军遇难，美国人在希腊的治外法权问题和美国人在希腊驻扎问题又重新被人们提出来了。
