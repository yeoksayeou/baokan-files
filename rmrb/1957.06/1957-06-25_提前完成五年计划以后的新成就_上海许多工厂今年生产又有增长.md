Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: Many factories in Shanghai that completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule last year have seen new increases in production this year; some factories are expanding production in preparation for the Second Five-Year Plan.

According to recent reports, the twelve factories under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company exceeded the output value level of 1957 at the end of last year. In the past five months, the output of steel and finished steel products has exceeded the plan by more than 10,000 tons; compared with the same period last year, steel output has increased by more than 40,000 tons, and steel products by more than 50,000 tons. In the electromechanical industry, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, which completed the Five-Year Plan's total machine tool output in September last year, has produced another 1,069 precision machine tools to date. The average output in the first five months of this year increased by 80% compared with the same period last year. The Precision Medical Device Factory, which produces large X-ray machines, has increased its output of X-ray machines by more than four times in the first five months of this year compared to the same period last year. Light industrial products such as penicillin, sulfa drugs, canned food, milk substitutes, and paper have also increased by 20% to more than threefold this year compared to last year.

In the past six months, these factories have also produced many new products beyond the scope of the Five-Year Plan. In addition to completing the planned 22 types of machine tools, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has successfully trial-produced five types of precision grinders for tractor factories, automobile factories, and tool factories. After manufacturing a 12,000 kW steam turbine beyond the Five-Year Plan, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant is now trial-producing a 1,500 kW steam turbine for sugar factories and a 750 kW steam turbine for small mining cities. Three medical device factories and pharmaceutical factories that completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule have trial-produced and produced more than 40 new products this year. Among them, the electroencephalograph trial-produced by the Precision Medical Device Factory is currently being tested and can help doctors examine the functional activity of the human brain.

The Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant and the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, which jointly produce complete sets of thermal power equipment, are now preparing for the important product of the Second Five-Year Plan—a 25,000 kW steam turbine generator set; the Electric Machinery Plant and Huatong Switch Factory have recently started expansion work. The new chlortetracycline workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, which produces antibiotics, is about to be completed, and chlortetracycline, which is in great demand domestically, will be available in large quantities in July. In the paper industry, factories such as Dachunghua, Tianzhang, and China Cement Company Paper Mill have recently added steaming ball equipment for pulp production or built factory buildings, preparing to expand the production of paper raw materials and increase paper production in the next five years.

　　提前完成五年计划以后的新成就
    上海许多工厂今年生产又有增长
    新华社上海24日电　上海许多去年提前完成第一个五年计划的工厂，今年生产又有新的增长；部分厂正在为第二个五年计划的生产进行扩建。
    据记者最近了解，上海钢铁公司所属的十二个厂去年年底超过1957年的产值水平以后，这五个月来钢和成品钢材的产量，都比计划多了一万多吨；跟去年同期产量相比，增加了四万多吨钢和五万多吨钢材。机电工业中，去年9月份完成五年机床总产量计划的上海机床厂，到现在为止，又生产了一千零六十九台精密机床，今年头五个月的平均产量比去年同期提高80％。生产大型爱克司光机的精密医疗器械厂，这五个月爱克司光机的产量比去年头五个月增加四倍多。青霉素、璜胺、罐头食品、代乳粉和纸张等轻工业品，今年也比去年提高两成到三倍以上。
    这些厂在这半年多内还生产了很多五年计划以外的新产品。上海机床厂完成了计划中的二十二种机床以外，又试制成功五种供拖拉机厂、汽车厂和工具厂用的精密磨床。上海汽轮机厂在制成了五年计划以外的一万二千瓩汽轮机后，又在试制一种糖厂用的一千五百瓩汽轮机和矿山小城市用的七百五十瓩汽轮机。三个提前完成五年计划的医疗器械厂和制药厂，今年已经试制和生产了四十多种新产品。其中如精密医疗器械厂试制的脑电图机，目前已在试用，它可以帮助医生检查人的脑部机能活动情况。
    联合生产成套火力发电设备的上海电机厂和上海汽轮机厂，现在正在为第二个五年计划时期的重要产品——二万五千瓩汽轮发电设备作准备；电机厂和华通开关厂最近已动工扩建。生产抗生素的上海第三制药厂，新建的金霉素车间即将完工，7月份就可以大量供应当前国内非常需要的金霉素。造纸工业中的大中华、天章和中国水泥公司造纸厂等厂，最近也都增添了生产纸浆的蒸球设备或修建了厂房，准备在下一个五年内，扩大纸张原料的生产，增产纸张。
