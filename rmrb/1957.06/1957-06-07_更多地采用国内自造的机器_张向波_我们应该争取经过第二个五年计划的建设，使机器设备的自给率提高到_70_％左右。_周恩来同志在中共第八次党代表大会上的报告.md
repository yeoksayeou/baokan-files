More Adoption of Domestically Produced Machines
Zhang Xiangbo “We should strive to increase the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment to about 70% through the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan.”
—Report by Comrade Zhou Enlai at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China

I.

One of the significant implications of increasing the self-sufficiency rate of equipment in capital construction is to save foreign exchange and reduce project costs.

In the early stages of the First Five-Year Plan, the main equipment used for the reconstruction of the No. 8 and No. 7 blast furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel was almost entirely ordered from abroad, with each set costing the equivalent of 6.32 million yuan in Renminbi. After 1954, the main equipment for the reconstruction of three blast furnaces began to be imitated by Shenyang, Fushun, Dalian, and other places. The scale and efficiency were roughly the same as the previous two, and some improvements were even made with the help of Soviet experts. The total price per set was only 3.7 million yuan, a difference of nearly double.

The price difference between domestically manufactured and imported main equipment for coke ovens was even more significant. The former cost a total of 1.43 million yuan, while the latter cost 3.743 million yuan, more than double.

For other major equipment such as mineral processing plants and sintering plants, as well as some general-purpose equipment for steelmaking plants and rolling mills, domestically produced items were generally one-third to one-half cheaper than imported ones.

For many types of machinery, the price difference between domestic and foreign products reached three times.

Ordering equipment domestically, compared to ordering from abroad, generally shortens the time of occupying funds without creating value by about a year, which is a huge saving. A year ago, Anshan Iron and Steel ordered equipment worth about 100 million yuan from abroad for several rolling mills. Currently, some of these rolling mills have not yet completed their civil engineering work; some design plans have not been finalized; and some have not even determined the factory site. As a result, the equipment is stored in warehouses for a long time without being able to produce, the money spent on it cannot circulate or increase in value, and a large amount of storage costs must be paid. Domestic equipment, on the other hand, mostly arrives two or three months, or even closer, before installation begins, and is directly transported to the construction site without needing to be stored. According to calculations, if the time that 100 million yuan of equipment investment occupies without creating value is shortened to two or three months, it could increase wealth by tens of millions of yuan within a year.

The difference in the length of time for occupying funds is mainly caused by objective reasons. Ordering domestically provides greater flexibility in terms of time, shorter transportation distances, and the ability to negotiate with manufacturing units to advance or postpone delivery times according to project needs. It also facilitates the timely understanding of manufacturing progress and encourages on-time completion. Ordering equipment from abroad, however, involves a complex process of communication, and supply departments, fearing delays in installation, often place orders two years before the project starts to ensure early delivery. For example, equipment for several rolling mills that Anshan decided to reduce or postpone this year is still being delivered, resulting in stockpiling.

The transportation and miscellaneous fees for domestic and foreign equipment also differ greatly. For equipment ordered domestically by Anshan Iron and Steel, the average transportation and miscellaneous fees are 40 yuan per 1,000 yuan of value; while for equipment ordered from abroad, the average is 145 yuan (including tariffs). Based on an equipment investment of 100 million yuan, the difference in transportation and miscellaneous fees between domestic and foreign purchases could buy two sets of main equipment for a blast furnace with an annual output of 400,000 tons of pig iron.

The high transportation and miscellaneous fees for foreign equipment are mainly due to the long distances involved. For example, transporting goods from the Soviet Union to Anshan requires several transfers, covering tens of thousands of miles and taking more than a month, so the packaging must be correspondingly stronger.

Reconstructing a large iron and steel complex like Anshan requires over 200,000 tons of various equipment, worth hundreds of millions of yuan. In the future, when building ferrous metallurgical complexes, fully utilizing domestic equipment and increasing the self-sufficiency rate will not only allow the country's foreign exchange to be used in the most needed areas but also enable more factories to be built with less capital.

II.

The rapid development of China's machinery industry, aided by the Soviet Union, has enabled Anshan Iron and Steel to increase its equipment self-sufficiency rate to over 60% this year. The equipment for the No. 3 blast furnace under construction is 98% domestically manufactured. The self-sufficiency rate for mineral processing, sintering, and coking systems has also reached about 90%. For equipment in steelmaking and rolling mills, which are more complex to manufacture, domestic production can account for approximately 40% to 50%.

Machines bearing the "Made in China" mark have not only increased in number but also expanded in variety. Many precision and large-scale machines have been manufactured in China for the first time in history. Two wagon tipplers imitated by Dalian can effortlessly tip an entire train car loaded with sixty tons of ore, unloading the ore. The domestically produced hot metal mixer installed in the Second Steelmaking Plant is three or four stories high and performs no worse than foreign-made ones. The coke pusher on the coke oven, the large sintering machine in the sintering plant, and the 140-ton ingot crane in the steelmaking plant are all domestically made, high-performing equipment.

Therefore, in newly built factories in recent years, the uneconomical situation of ordering complete sets of equipment from abroad, from complex machines to rough and simple equipment such as floors, steel ladders, and railings, has been reduced.

III.

To further increase the equipment self-sufficiency rate, there are still many difficulties. On the objective side, China does not yet have a complete industrial system, and its design and manufacturing capabilities are weak. However, according to those responsible for ordering equipment at Anshan Iron and Steel, there are still quite a few man-made obstacles.

Some construction units are unwilling to use Chinese-made machines. They have a fixed idea: "Chinese-made products are always inferior to foreign-made ones." When someone proposes ordering domestic machines for a certain project, the construction unit asks: "Can you guarantee that there will be no accidents?" No one dares to provide an absolute guarantee against accidents, so they have to order from abroad. This is a kind of blind worship of foreign goods. It is a fact that the domestic manufacturing level is lower, but there is also a wealth of evidence proving that this is not absolute. Some factories have large, precision machines made in China that are working very well. Recently, when the Chinese-made hoist on the No. 3 blast furnace was being test-run, some people considered the slight heating of the axle tile roller to be a serious defect; but in the past, when equipment ordered from abroad also experienced heating during operation, everyone did not care, as if the presence of a few foreign words on the machine gave them a sense of security.

Furthermore, when equipment ordered from abroad does not arrive on time, everyone understands the difficulties of the ordering department and there is less complaining and blaming; if equipment ordered domestically does not arrive on time, regardless of the reason, the equipment supply department will immediately be attacked from all sides. Therefore, even if some equipment can be manufactured domestically, procurement personnel are afraid that the time cannot be guaranteed, so they simply order it from abroad.

Since the machinery industry emphasized specialization, factories prefer to produce standard, mass-produced equipment and are unwilling to accept single, non-standard orders because these orders generate less output value, less profit, and do not showcase achievements. As a result, many equipment items that could have been made domestically have to be ordered from abroad. For example, the only machine ordered from abroad for the No. 3 blast furnace is a blower, but the complete set of blower components can currently be manufactured in Shanghai and other places. Another example is the air compressor that produces 100 cubic meters of air per minute, which has been successfully trial-manufactured by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, but it is said that it is not suitable for Heavy Machinery Plant to manufacture, so they refuse to make it.

Manufacturing an important piece of equipment often requires the cooperation of several factories. The organization of this collaboration is very important, but this issue has not been well resolved to date. When Anshan Iron and Steel ordered hoists and other equipment from the First Ministry of Machine Building, the First Ministry of Machine Building instructed Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant to take the lead in manufacturing, with Shenyang, Taiyuan, and other places providing support. However, the lead manufacturer was afraid of trouble and unwilling to undertake the organizational work. After various contacts, consultations, official correspondence, and disputes, it took nearly a year to sign the manufacturing contract, and the efficiency was so low!

The lack of mutual understanding between construction departments and manufacturing plants regarding supply and demand also hinders the ordering of more domestic equipment.

Due to many difficulties, the uneconomical situation of Anshan Iron and Steel ordering complete sets of equipment from abroad without choice still exists.

IV.

The fundamental way for large iron and steel complexes to achieve self-sufficiency in complete sets of equipment is, of course, to establish an independent industrial system. At present, if some projects do not order complete sets of equipment from abroad, many complex issues still need to be resolved—such as the balance of domestic and especially foreign production capacity. However, Anshan Iron and Steel's experience proves that if measures are taken to overcome some subjective obstacles, the equipment self-sufficiency rate can be greatly increased under existing technical conditions.

First of all, imitating Soviet product drawings or surveying samples is an effective way to overcome the weakness of design capabilities. The large and precision equipment made in China that is currently installed in various factories and mines is all imitated based on Soviet data. The Hebei Local State-Owned Tangshan Machinery Factory, which was originally only capable of repair and assembly work, has now become an important supplier of mining equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel through the imitation process.

Secondly, machinery manufacturing plants must also overcome the fear of difficulty. The weighing car used for Anshan's blast furnace was originally dared not to be made by any factory, but Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory succeeded in the first trial, and now the quality of this product is getting better and better; even more complex ones can be made. Last year, the large shaft of a crusher at Dagushan Iron Mine broke. The shaft was 900 millimeters thick, and there was no steam hammer in China to forge such a large piece. When ordering from abroad was not possible in time, Anshan Machinery General Plant successfully cast one with alloy steel to replace it. Of course, the "fear of difficulty" of machinery plants is not without reason, such as the high cost of manufacturing new single products, difficulties in collaboration, and sometimes a lack of raw materials, etc. However, the competent authorities should and can help solve these difficulties.

Thirdly, it is also necessary to determine the organizer of the collaboration and clarify the responsibilities of all parties. This is an important key to manufacturing large and precision equipment. According to experienced engineers, small and medium-sized rolling mill equipment can be completely manufactured in Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places as long as the organizational work is done well.

Finally, product promotion is also very important. Each machinery plant should have its own product specifications to facilitate selection and adoption by construction departments.

### 更多地采用国内自造的机器  张向波“我们应该争取经过第二个五年计划的建设，使机器设备的自给率提高到70％左右。”——周恩来同志在中共第八次党代表大会上的报告

    更多地采用国内自造的机器
    张向波“我们应该争取经过第二个五年计划的建设，使机器设备的自给率提高到70％左右。”
    ——周恩来同志在中共第八次党代表大会上的报告
    一
    在基本建设中，提高设备自给率的重大意义之一，是节约外汇，降低工程造价。
    在第一个五年计划初期，鞍钢改建的八号、七号炼铁炉，使用的主要设备几乎是成套向国外订购的，每套付出的总价格折合人民币六百三十二万元；1954年以后改建的三座炼铁炉，主要设备开始由沈阳、抚顺、大连等地仿制，规模、效能和前两座大致相同，有些地方在苏联专家帮助下还有些改进，每套总价格只有三百七十多万元，两者相差将近一倍。
    炼焦炉的主要设备，国内制造的和国外进口的价格相差更悬殊，前者总价格为一百四十三万元，后者为三百七十四万三千元，高出一倍以上。
    其他如选矿厂、烧结厂的主要设备，以及炼钢厂、轧钢厂的部分通用设备，国内造的比进口的价值一般低三分之一到二分之一。
    有许多种机器，国内和国外价格相差达三倍。
    在国内订购设备比在国外订购设备，不能创造价值的占用资金时间一般要短一年左右，这是一项巨大的节约。鞍钢在一年前就为几个轧钢厂向国外订来了价值一亿元左右的设备。现在，这几个轧钢厂有的土建工程还未完成；有的设计方案还未定下来；有的甚至厂址还未确定。结果设备放在仓库里长期不能生产，为它花去的钱当然也不能流转、不能增殖，并且还得付出大量的保管费用。而国内设备，则大都是开始安装前二、三个月甚至更近的时间到达，根本不要入库就直接运到工地。据计算，如果一亿元设备投资不能创造价值的占用时间缩短到两、三个月，在一年之内，就可能增殖上千万元的财富。
    占用资金长短的差别，主要是客观原因造成的。在国内订货，时间上机动性较大，运途短，可以根据工程需要，同承制单位协商提前或推后交付时间，并且便于随时了解制造情况，督促按期制成。而在国外订购设备，联系过程复杂，供应部门怕耽误安装，往往在工程开工前两年即提出订货，以争取早日运到。如鞍山今年决定削减或缓建的几个轧钢厂用的设备，现在仍在继续运来，造成了积压。
    国内外设备的运杂费也相差很大。鞍钢在国内订购的设备，如果价值一千元的话，支出的运杂费平均为四十元；而订购国外设备，则平均需要一百四十五元（包括关税）。以设备投资一亿元计算，国内、国外运杂费的差额就可以买到年产四十万吨生铁的高炉主要设备两套。
    国外设备运杂费所以高，很重要的原因是路途遥远。例如，从苏联运来鞍山，要转好几次车，行程万里，需时月余，因此包装的牢固程度也得相应提高。
    改建鞍山这样大的钢铁联合企业，各式各样的设备需要二十几万吨，价值数亿元。今后建设黑色冶金联合企业的时候，如果充分利用国内设备，提高自给率，不但可以使国家的外汇用到最需要的方面去，同时还可以作到用较少的资金办更多的工厂。
    二
    在苏联帮助下飞速发展的我国机械工业，使鞍钢今年的设备自给率已提高到60％以上，正在建设的三号炼铁炉设备，98％是国内制造的；选矿、烧结和炼焦系统的设备自给率也达到了90％左右；制造过程比较复杂的炼钢厂和轧钢厂的设备，国内大约也能制造40％—50％。
    有中国制造标记的机器不但在比数上增加了，种类上也扩大了，其中有许多精密的、大型的机器，都是在我国历史上第一次造出来的。大连仿制的两台翻车机，能不费力的把一节载有六十吨矿石的火车整个倾复，卸出矿石。第二炼钢厂安装的国产混铁炉，有三、四层楼高，生产起来并不比国外造的差。炼焦炉上的推焦机，烧结厂里的大型烧结机，炼钢厂里起重能力一百四十吨的铸锭吊车，……都是国内造的效能良好的设备。
    因此，近几年来新建的工厂里，像过去那样从复杂的机器，到地板、钢梯、栏杆等较粗糙简单的设备，成套向国外订购的不经济的情况，已经减少了。
    三
    要继续提高设备自给率，目前还有许多困难。来自客观方面的是，我国还没有完整的工业体系，设计和制造能力薄弱。但是，据鞍钢负责订购设备的人们说：人为的阻力还是相当多的。
    有些建设单位不愿意用中国制造的机器，他们有一个固定的观念：“中国造的总不如外国造的好。”当有人提出为某一个工程订国内机器的时候，建设单位就问道：“你能保证不出事故吗？”绝对不出事故的“保条”自然无人敢打，就只好向国外订了。这是一种盲目崇外思想，国内制造水平较低是事实，可是也有大量事实证明这不是绝对的，有些工厂就有中国造的大型、精密的机器在很好的工作着。最近三号高炉上中国造的卷扬机在试运转的时候，轴瓦滚珠有些发热，有些人就认为是严重的缺陷；而过去在国外订来的设备，运转时也有发热现象，大家却不在乎，好像机器上有几个外国字，就给了他们安全感。
    再如，向国外订的设备未按期到达，大家都原谅订购部门的困难，埋怨指责少；在国内订购的设备如果未及时到，不管是什么原因，设备供应部门马上会受到来自各方面的攻击。因此，尽管有的设备国内能制造，采购人员怕时间上不能保证，就索性向外订了。
    自从机械工业强调专业化以后，各厂都喜欢作标准的成批设备，而不愿接受那些单一的、非标准的订货。因为这种订货的生产总值少，利润少，显不出成绩。结果，有许多国内本来能造的设备，也不得不到国外订购。例如三号高炉唯一向国外订购的机器是鼓风机，而鼓风机的全套部件目前上海等地是有条件制造的。又如每分钟生产一百立方公尺的空气压缩机，沈阳重型机器厂已试制成功，但据说不适合重机厂制造，就推脱不作。
    制造一个重要的设备，往往需要几个工厂协作，这种协作的组织工作很重要，但这个问题至今没有很好解决。鞍钢向第一机械工业部订卷扬机等设备，第一机械工业部指示抚顺重型机械厂主制，由沈阳、太原等地配合。但主制厂怕麻烦，不愿担任组织工作，经过各方面联系、协商、公文往返、扯皮，……花去了将近一年时间才把承制合同签订下来，效率竟是这么低！
    建设部门和承制厂之间的供求情况互不了解，也阻碍着更多订购国内设备。
    由于困难很多，现在鞍钢无选择的成套向外订购设备的不经济情况仍旧存在。
    四
    大的钢铁联合企业要做到整套设备自给，根本的办法当然是建立独立的工业体系。在目前，如果有些工程不成套地向国外订购，还需要解决许多复杂的问题——如国内尤其是国外生产能力的平衡等。但是，鞍钢的经验证明，如果采取措施，克服一些主观阻力，在现有的技术条件下设备自给率还可以大大提高。
    首先，仿照苏联的产品图样或照样品测绘，是克服设计力量薄弱的有效办法。现在各厂矿安装的中国造的大型、精密设备，都是根据苏联资料仿制的。河北地方国营唐山机械厂原来只能作修配工作，在仿制过程中，现在已成了鞍钢矿山设备的重要的供应者。
    其次，机械制造厂还要克服怕困难的思想。鞍钢高炉用的称量车，原来各厂都不敢作，大连工矿车辆厂试验一次成功了，现在这种产品的质量越来越好；更复杂的也能作了。去年大孤山铁矿的一个破碎机断了大轴，这个轴有九百公厘粗，国内没有锻这种大活的汽锤，在向外订货来不及的情况下，鞍钢机械总厂成功地以合金钢铸造了一个来代替。当然，机械厂的“畏难”情绪，并不是毫无来由。如制造新的单一产品成本高，协作困难，有时没有原料等等。……但这些困难主管部门是应该而且可能帮助解决的。
    再次，还要确定协作的组织者，明确各方面的责任。这是制造大型、精密设备的重要关键。据有经验的工程师说，中小型的轧钢设备，只要作好组织工作，沈阳、上海等地是完全可以制造的。
    最后，产品的宣传工作也很重要，各机械厂应该有自己的产品说明书，以便建设部门选择采用。
