Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: According to TASS, Montevideo, June 3rd: Brazilian newspapers report that the Brazilian public is widely launching an anti-imperialist movement, with the participation of parliamentarians, trade union leaders, leaders of many industrial and commercial groups, students, and other patriotic residents.

"Worker's Voice" reported that the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil has established an Anti-Imperialist Federation; the "Nationalist Parliamentary Front" has been formed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul; and the Natal City Nationalist Center has been established in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Patriotic organizations of this kind have also been established in the city of Vitoria.

The newspaper pointed out that all these organizations have in common: struggling against turning the national territory into US military bases, protecting "Petrobras" and national wealth, and striving for democratic freedom and a peaceful foreign policy.

Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: According to TASS, New York, June 1st: The Mexican weekly "Siempre!" published an open letter from Martinéz, a famous Mexican journalist and social activist, to the US Ambassador to Mexico, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the shameless American dominance over Mexico.

Martinéz wrote that the actions of many American diplomats in Mexico "are like agents of powerful trusts." He said that in analyzing the past, we can see the existence of a crude and aggressive "dollar diplomacy," and the US Embassy in Mexico attempts to overstep its authority and interfere in our internal affairs.

    巴西展开反帝运动
    墨西哥名记者谴责美驻墨使节喧宾夺主
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社蒙德维的亚3日讯：巴西报纸报道，巴西公众正在广泛展开反帝国主义运动，参加这个运动的有议员、工会领袖、许多工商业团体的领导人、学生以及其他爱国的居民。
    “工人呼声报”说，巴西的米纳斯吉拉斯州成立了一个反帝国主义联合会；在里约格朗德苏尔州组成了“民族主义议会阵线”；在里约格朗德诺特州建立了纳塔尔市民族主义中心。维托里亚市也建立了这种爱国组织。
    这个报纸指出，所有这些组织的共同点是：为反对把国家领土变作美国军事基地、保护“巴西石油公司”和民族财富而斗争，为争取民主自由及和平的外交政策而斗争。
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：墨西哥“永久”周刊登载了墨西哥著名记者、社会活动家马丁内兹给美国驻墨西哥大使的一封公开信，对美国人厚颜无耻地主宰墨西哥深深表示不满。
    马丁内兹写道，许多美国外交官在墨西哥的行动“像是实力雄厚的托辣斯的代理人”。他说，在分析过去的情况时，我们可以看到存在着粗暴的侵略性的“美元外交”，美国驻墨西哥大使馆企图越出本身职权，干涉我国内政。
