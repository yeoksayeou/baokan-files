　　Dedication of Youth to the Lofty Cause of Building Communism
　　A Large Number of Young Soviet Experts Take Up Their Positions
　　(Our Newspaper Moscow, 22nd dispatch) This year, Soviet higher education institutions will have approximately 270,000 young specialized talents graduating, including people from all Soviet nationalities, an increase of 15,000 compared to last year. This was stated by Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, in an article published in "Moscow News."
　　Soviet higher education institutions are currently holding examinations. Moscow's higher education institutions have brought forward the examinations in preparation for welcoming the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship. Yelyutin said that more than 27,000 newly graduated agronomists, mechanics, animal husbandry specialists, and veterinarians will go to work in collective farms and state farms. More than 80,000 teachers will be added to middle schools, technical schools, and other educational institutions. Twenty-three thousand young doctors will supplement hospitals in urban and rural areas. One-third of these new specialized talents studied in night schools and correspondence courses without leaving their production posts. They have already applied the knowledge they have learned to their work.
　　Yelyutin said that the Soviet government has approved a plan for assigning university graduates to work, which is based on the needs of the national economy. Graduates have already known where they will go to work. They are allowed to choose three months before graduation. Each higher education institution has established a special committee to handle this issue. When the committee assigns a job to a student, it considers his wishes, family situation, and health. If a student presents a proper reason for not being able to go, then they will find him a suitable job.
　　This batch of graduates will soon be working in the positions they have chosen. Many of them are willing to work in the Far East, Siberia, the Urals, Kazakhstan, and the newly cultivated areas. According to labor law, young specialized talents receive a one-month vacation voucher from the unit they will be serving before going to work. When going to work, the travel expenses of them and their families are provided by the state.
　　Yelyutin said that national higher education institutions will enroll 425,000 students in the new academic year. New enrollment rules will be adopted, and those who have worked in the national economy or cultural departments for two years will have priority in being admitted in the examination competition compared to those with equal grades. Soldiers demobilized from the army and navy and soldiers who participated in the Patriotic War have the same rights.

　　把青春献给建设共产主义的豪迈事业
    苏联大批青年专家走上工作岗位
    本报莫斯科22日电　苏联高等学校今年将有约二十七万青年专门人才毕业，包括苏联各个民族，比去年增加一万五千人。这是苏联高等教育部部长叶留金发表在“莫斯科新闻”的文章中说的。
    苏联高等学校正在举行考试。莫斯科高等学校因为准备迎接世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节把考试提前了。叶留金说：二万七千多名新毕业的农艺师、机械师、养畜师和兽医将到集体农庄和国营农场工作。中学、技术学校和其他教育机关将增加八万多名教师。二万三千名青年医生将补充到城乡医院去。这批新专门人才的三分之一是不脱离生产地在夜校和函授班学习出来的。他们已经把学来的知识用到工作中去。
    叶留金说：苏联政府已经批准一个分配大学毕业学生工作的方案，这个方案是根据国民经济的需要作出的。毕业生早已经知道他们到那里去工作。在毕业前三个月让他们选择。每个高等学校都设立一个专门委员会处理这个问题。当委员会给学生一项工作时，要考虑他的愿望、家庭情况和健康情况。如果学生提出适当的理由不能去，那么就给他们找合适的工作。
    这次毕业生很快将在他们所挑选的岗位工作了。他们许多愿到远东、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、哈萨克斯坦以及新垦地区工作。根据劳动法，青年专门人才在赴工作以前从他们所服务的单位取得一个月的休养券。在赴工作时，他们及其家庭的旅费由国家供给。
    叶留金说，全国高等学校在新学年将招收四十二万五千名学生。将采用新的招生规则，凡在国民经济或文化部门工作上两年者，在考试竞赛中比同等成绩的人有优先被录取的权利。从军队和舰队复员以及参加过卫国战争的战士，也有同样权利。
