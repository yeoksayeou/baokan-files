Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 20th - This year, Romania's industrial output will be 3.4 times that of 1938, compared to 2.9 times in 1955.

Currently, the focus of Romania's industrial development is on departments that have domestic raw materials or fuel sources, such as the chemical, petroleum, electricity, and building materials industries. During the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the machine manufacturing industry will continue to occupy an important position in the overall industrial development, with the basic task of increasing the production of steel and rolled products.

According to the Party and government's policy of strengthening agricultural and light industrial development, Romania's chemical industry is focusing on the production of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, man-made fibers, and plastics. The country's first and largest synthetic fiber factory in Southeast Europe, which is currently under construction, will be put into production by the end of next year. This factory, equipped with the most modern production equipment, will produce many kinds of rayon and artificial fibers.

During the second Five-Year Plan, more than three-quarters of the increase in industrial products will be achieved by improving the utilization rate of existing equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest - In the first four months of this year, more than 240,000 Romanian farmers joined various agricultural production cooperative organizations, 80,000 more than in the same period last year.

Before last December, there were only two fully cooperative counties in the country. Now, the number of such counties has increased to thirteen.

By the first quarter of this year, the land cooperativized in Romania had reached about one-fifth of the country's agricultural land. In addition, there are more than 300 state-owned farms, which own 800,000 hectares of land. The Romanian Workers' Party and the government are striving to ensure that 60% to 70% of the total commodity grain comes from the socialist sector of agriculture by 1960.

　　首先发展本国拥有原料的部门
    罗马尼亚工业近年大有发展
    今年头四个月有二十多万农户参加农业社
    新华社布加勒斯特20日电　今年，罗马尼亚的工业产量将为1938年的三·四倍，而1955年为1938年的二·九倍。
    目前罗马尼亚工业发展的重点是那些在国内拥有原料或燃料来源的部门，如化学、石油、电力、建筑材料工业等。在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，机器制造工业在整个工业发展中仍然占有重要地位，基本任务是增加钢和压延品的生产。
    根据党和政府加强农业和轻工业发展的方针，罗马尼亚的化学工业正在着重发展化学肥料、杀虫剂、人造纤维和塑料的生产。目前正在建设的全国第一个、也是东南欧最大的一个合成纤维工厂，将在明年年底投入生产，这个拥有最现代化的生产设备的工厂将要生产许多种人造丝和人造纤维。
    在第二个五年计划期间，工业产品的增长部分中将有四分之三以上靠提高现有设备的利用率来实现。
    新华社布加勒斯特电　今年头四个月罗马尼亚有二十四万多户农民加入了各种农业生产合作组织，比去年同期多八万户。
    去年12月以前，全国只有两个完全合作化的县，现在这样的县已经增加到十三个了。
    罗马尼亚合作化了的土地到今年第一季已经达到全国农业用地的五分之一左右，另外还有三百多个国营农场，它们拥有的土地有八十万公顷。罗马尼亚工人党和政府争取在1960年使整个商品谷物中有60％至70％来自农业中的社会主义部分。
