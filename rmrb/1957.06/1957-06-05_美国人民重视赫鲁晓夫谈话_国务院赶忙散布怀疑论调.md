Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from New York: At 3:30 PM New York time on June 3rd, approximately ten million Americans watched and listened to Khrushchev's talk with representatives of the "Columbia Broadcasting System" in Moscow on television. Countless television viewers conveyed their impressions to the television company within minutes of the broadcast's conclusion. Many people said that Khrushchev was a "relaxed and confident" person, and his talk was "very pleasing."

According to a Columbia Broadcasting System spokesperson, the vast majority of comments were favorable. He said it was "the greatest news broadcast of a regular television radio program."

The "New York Times" published the full text of Khrushchev's speech. The "New York Herald Tribune" published a detailed summary. Other newspapers also widely reported the talk. American newspaper editorials generally believed that Khrushchev's appearance on American screens was of major historical significance.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on June 3rd regarding Khrushchev's televised talk with representatives of the "Columbia Broadcasting System," saying that the talk "attempts to give the impression that the Soviet government is now prepared to seek solutions to some of the major problems facing the world." The statement said that the U.S. government would "gladly accept" the Soviet government's expression of its willingness to seek acceptable agreements.

However, the State Department's statement went on to say that "only time will tell" whether the Soviet government is now willing to engage in "fruitful negotiations" with Western countries.

State Department spokesman Reed said in response to questions from reporters that Khrushchev's proposal regarding the withdrawal of American troops from Western Europe and Soviet troops from Eastern Europe was "unacceptable" to the United States.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty, specifically addressing Khrushchev's statement that "your grandchildren will also live under a socialist system in America," reiterated the U.S.'s hope that the Soviet Union would develop a so-called "free political system." At the same time, he dismissed Khrushchev's talk as "old Russian propaganda" and refused to comment on it.

Speaker of the House Rayburn declined to comment on Khrushchev's speech. However, he said he hoped an agreement could be reached on ending hydrogen bomb tests.

    美国人民重视赫鲁晓夫谈话
    国务院赶忙散布怀疑论调
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：6月3日纽约时间十五点三十分，美国约有一千万人在电视中看到和听到了赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科对“哥伦比亚广播公司”代表们的谈话。无数电视观众在广播结束的几分钟后就向电视公司反映了自己的印象。许多人都说，赫鲁晓夫是一位“轻松而有自信心”的人，他的谈话“很能使人高兴”。
    据哥伦比亚广播公司发言人说，绝大多数的评论都是良好的。他说，这是“固定的电视无线电节目中最伟大的一次新闻广播”。
    “纽约时报”全文刊载了赫鲁晓夫的谈话。“纽约先驱论坛报”刊登了详细的摘要。其他各报也广泛报道了这次谈话。美国报纸的社论普遍认为，赫鲁晓夫在美国银幕上的出现，是具有重大的历史意义的。
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院6月3日就赫鲁晓夫对“哥伦比亚广播公司”代表们的电视谈话发表声明说，这个谈话“企图给人这样的印象：苏联政府现在准备设法解决世界所面临的某些重大问题”。声明说，就苏联政府表示它要设法达成可以接受的协议而言，美国政府将“欣然接受”。
    但是，国务院的声明接着又说，“只有时间才会证明”苏联政府现在是否愿同西方国家进行“有成果的谈判”。
    国务院发言人里德在回答记者提出的问题时说，赫鲁晓夫谈到的关于美国自西欧撤军和苏联自东欧撤军的建议是美国“不能接受的”。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂特别针对赫鲁晓夫所说的“你们的孙子也将在美国的社会主义制度下生活”这一句话，重申美国希望苏联会出现所谓“自由政体”。同时，他把赫鲁晓夫的谈话说成是“俄国宣传的老调”，而拒绝加以评论。
    众议院议长雷朋拒绝对赫鲁晓夫的谈话表示意见。但是他说，他希望能够就停止氢弹试验达成协议。
