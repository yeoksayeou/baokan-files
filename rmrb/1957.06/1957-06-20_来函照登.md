Letters to the Editor

People's Daily Editorial Department:
    The national agricultural exhibition hall forestry pavilion introduced the afforestation area of over 70 million mu (more than 4.69 million hectares) in the spring of 1956. This figure is based on the statistics of the materials reported by various regions at that time. This number was published in your newspaper's "A Great Review on the Agricultural Front" on February 21, 1957. However, according to the results of the autumn young forest inspection: the survival rate of afforestation in some townships and communes last year was less than 25%, and many places estimated that the afforestation area was higher than the actual area. (The main reason is that the scale of afforestation in 1956 was unprecedentedly large, but the technical strength of afforestation and the organization and leadership work could not keep up with the development of the objective situation, resulting in the poor quality of the afforested young forests and the rather rough area calculation.) According to regulations, forest land with an afforestation survival rate of less than 25% should not be included in the completed afforestation figures, and areas that are too high should be corrected according to the facts. Now, after such verification and correction, the total afforestation area for the year is only over 50 million mu. This is specially explained, please publish it.

    全国农业展览会林业馆所介绍的1956年春季造林面积七千余万亩
  （四百六十九万多公顷），这个数字是根据当时各地所报材料统计的。此数曾在你报1957年2月21日“农业战线上的大检阅”一文中发表过。而根据秋季幼林检查结果：去年有的乡、社的造林成活率不到25％，很多地方估算造林面积较实际面积为高。（主要原因是由于1956年造林规模空前壮大而造林技术力量和组织领导工作不能相应地跟上客观形势的发展，致所造幼林在质量上还不够好、在面积计算上还相当粗糙。）按规定，造林成活率不足25％的林地不应计入造林完成数字内，面积偏高的应据实修正。现全年造林面积经过这样核实修正以后仅为五千余万亩。特此说明，请予发表。
