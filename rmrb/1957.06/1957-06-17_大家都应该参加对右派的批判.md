Everyone Should Participate in the Criticism of the Rightists
　　Professor of Peking University Shao Xunzheng

　　It is absolutely necessary to launch a counter-criticism against anti-socialist remarks in the rectification movement. Because anti-socialist remarks have openly attacked the people's regime, have shouted that they do not want the leadership of the Party, and have put forward the political programs of a very small number of people, as if little sparrows can become the leader of all birds if they want to overthrow the phoenix. At the same time, anti-socialist remarks have become a stumbling block to the rectification movement. They even propagandize that the root of bureaucracy is socialism, as if they are so ignorant that they don't even know the source of this term, as if the many books and articles discussing their serious bureaucracy in capitalist countries (including the United States) for decades do not exist, as if they do not know that there are also sectarianism and subjectivism in other stages of human social development. This is not inconceivable. Because they fundamentally oppose rectification. They deceive the masses by saying that the three evils cannot be eliminated. In fact, they think that the more serious the three evils are, the better. On the one hand, they try their best to exaggerate the shortcomings of the leadership and slander the Party with unwarranted accusations. At the same time, they attack those who make suggestions to the Party based on facts, believing that all opinions are irrelevant except to fundamentally deny the Party's leadership. Their anti-socialist stance is extremely clear and the impact is extremely bad. This is the case at Peking University.
    
　　There is no doubt that these extremely absurd remarks must be severely criticized. In the process of distinguishing between right and wrong, we should not only pay attention to "distinguishing," but also pay attention to "clarifying"; not only to recognize what anti-socialist remarks are, but also to clearly draw a line with them. Anti-socialist remarks actually have their own political program. Looking at its general political tendency, we can clearly see the nature of this attempt. The anti-socialist programs of some right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Chen Xingui, etc., have been exposed to the public after preliminary criticism and exposure. These individual members of democratic parties did put forward their political program to attack the Party in the form of a chorus. These people vainly attempt to forcibly drag some democratic parties to the direction of opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, forgetting that all democratic parties have expressed their support and acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, forgetting that the vast majority of members of these parties have publicly said "always follow the Communist Party." They even attempt to treat the democratic parties as the private property of a small group of people, to use the newspapers of the democratic parties as newspapers to attack and ridicule the Communist Party, and to turn the democratic parties into parties that not only enjoy the right to irresponsibly criticize and attack as opposition parties, but also enjoy the actual power to share political power equally. This is too delusional and too absurd. For these people, we cannot help but ask, "What exactly are you doing?" No leniency can be shown for these people's anti-socialist remarks. These cannot be regarded as personal ideological issues and considered that they can be transformed using gentle and mild methods. We should beat the drums and attack them, and expose their problems. Therefore, I disagree with Fei Xiaotong's speech on anti-socialist fallacies a few days ago, and I hope that he will clearly change this ambiguous attitude. This attitude itself is extremely harmful.

　　Within the scope of the school, it is equally necessary to carry out large-scale counter-criticism. Although the black sheep among young students (such as at Peking University) are individual, they actually have a complete set of political programs, and they swindle and deceive, taking the country's disadvantage as their own advantage. The reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements are not only like poisonous weeds, but also more like poisonous gas. Poisonous weeds can sometimes play the role of medicine, and there will be no harm as long as they can be identified. The spread of poisonous gas will kill many people. The black sheep of Peking University mentioned above openly claimed to be "a poisonous weed," as if this would give them a legitimate status, which is completely a dream. I want to tell him, "You have become poisonous gas."

　　At present, some people feel that the current anti-socialist fallacies should be severely criticized, but they are also afraid of causing concerns for the speakers and hindering the rectification. This idea of "being afraid of breaking the vase while trying to hit the rat" is wrong. First of all, to make everyone clear about what anti-socialist remarks are and what are not anti-socialist remarks, it is necessary to vigorously criticize anti-socialist remarks. The more profound the criticism, the clearer the nature of anti-socialist remarks will be. People who speak wrongly out of good intentions will naturally not be misunderstood or criticized. For example, anti-socialist remarks in schools require the Party committee to withdraw from the school, but some teachers who actively make suggestions to the Party have also put forward the view of "professors governing the school." The former is malicious sabotage, and the latter is a well-intentioned but one-sided suggestion. Would anyone misunderstand the latter as anti-socialist remarks? For example, we believe that the remarks of Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, etc. are anti-socialist remarks. Is it because they said something wrong at a time? Second, participating in the criticism of anti-socialist fallacies is the most effective way to improve awareness and enhance unity at present. Everyone participates in the criticism and opposes these anti-Party remarks. When they stand firm and their understanding is improved, they will inevitably make suggestions for the shortcomings in the Party's work with more confidence and more consciously. This will be of great benefit to the rectification movement. Third, whether the rectification movement proceeds smoothly or not mainly depends on the leadership's determination to correct mistakes. What the masses want to see is whether this determination is great. If the leadership actively corrects mistakes, the concerns of the masses will naturally be eliminated, and unity will also be significantly increased. The experiences of many universities in the first stage of the movement have fully proven this. Fourth, anti-socialist remarks themselves are opposed to the rectification movement. These people with ulterior motives (such as at Peking University) have stated that the deeper the "three evils," the more beneficial it is to them. On the one hand, they spread unfounded slanders, and on the other hand, they ridicule those who actively make suggestions to the Party, saying that "what is revealed is only superficial and does not touch the essence." If the vicious conspiracy of these scoundrels is not thoroughly exposed, the honest people will be demoralized. Is it actually possible to say to the anti-socialist advocates, "You make trouble as you please, and I will carry out my rectification"?

　　Therefore, I believe that fully criticizing the right-wingers not only does not hinder rectification, but also will be of great benefit to the rectification movement.

　　大家都应该参加对右派的批判
　　北京大学教授  邵循正
    在整风运动中展开对于反社会主义言论的反批评是完全必要的。因为反社会主义言论已经公然向人民政权进攻，已经喊出不要党的领导，已经提出极少数人自己的政治纲领，好像小麻雀们想打倒凤凰便可以当百鸟之长了。同时反社会主义言论已经成为整风运动的绊脚石。他们竟然宣传官僚主义的根源是社会主义，好像他们居然是如此无知，连这个名词的来源都不知道，好像资本主义各国（包括美国）几十年来讨论它们严重的官僚主义的许多书籍和文章都是不存在的，好像他们也不知道人类社会的其他发展阶段中也有宗派主义和主观主义。这并不是不可思议的。因为他们根本反对整风。他们欺骗群众说三害是除不了的，实际上他们认为三害越严重越好。他们一面对于领导的缺点极力渲染，并且无中生有地对党诬蔑。同时他们打击实事求是地向党提意见的人们，认为除了从根本上来否认党的领导以外，一切意见都是无关痛痒的。他们的反社会主义立场是极其鲜明的，影响也是极坏的。在北京大学的情况就是如此。
    毫无疑问，对于这些极端荒谬的言论，必须严厉地加以批判。在明辨是非的过程中，我们自己不要只注意“辨”，而且要注意“明”；不只是要认识什么是反社会主义言论，而是要清楚地和它划清界限。反社会主义言论实际上有它的政治纲领。要就它总的政治倾向看，就可清楚地看出这种企图的性质。一些右派分子如章伯钧、章乃器、储安平、陈新桂等的反社会主义纲领，经过初步的批判和揭发，已经是众目共睹的了。这些民主党派中的个别分子确是以大合唱的方式公开地提出他们向党进攻的政治纲领的。这些人妄想把一些民主党派硬拉到反对共产党领导的方向去，忘记了各民主党派都是曾经表示过拥护和接受共产党的领导的，忘记了这些党派的绝大多数的成员都曾经公开地说过“永远跟共产党走”。他们居然企图把民主党派当作一小撮人的私产，把民主党派的报纸作为攻击嘲笑共产党的报纸，把民主党派变成既享有在野党的不负责地批评攻击的权利，又享有在政治上平分秋色的实际权力。这也未免太妄想，太荒谬了。对于这些人，我们不能不问，“你们究竟是在干什么的？”对于这些人的反社会主义言论是丝毫不能留情的。不能把这些看作个人思想问题，认为可以用和风细雨的方法进行改造，应该鸣鼓而攻之，应该把他们的问题揭发出来。所以我不同意费孝通在前几天对于反社会主义谬论的发言，我希望他明确地改变这种模棱两可的态度。这个态度本身，就有极大的危害性。
    就学校范围内，大规模地开展反批评是同样必要的。青年学生中的害群之马（如在北大），虽然是个别的，但也居然有整套的政治纲领，而且招摇撞骗，以国家之不利为自己之利。右派分子的反动言论不但像毒草，还更像毒气。毒草有时还可以起药石的作用，只要能够识别它就不会有什么害处。毒气蔓延就要害死多少人。上面所说的北大的害群之马竟公然自称是“一株毒草”，好像这样就可以取得合法存在的地位，那完全是梦想。我要告诉他，“你已经变成毒气了。”
    目前有些人既感到对于目前反社会主义谬论应该加以痛斥，但又怕引起发言者的顾虑，妨碍整风。这种“投鼠忌器”的想法是不对的。首先，要大家清楚什么是反社会主义言论，什么不是反社会主义言论，这就必须大张旗鼓批判反社会主义言论。批判越深刻，反社会主义言论的性质就越清楚。好心而说错话的人自然不会遭到误解和非难。例如，在学校中反社会主义言论要求党委会退出学校，但是有一些积极向党提意见的教师也曾经提过“教授治校”的看法。前者是恶意的破坏，后者是善意的但是片面的建议，难道会有人把后者误认为是反社会主义言论吗？又如我们认为章乃器、章伯钧、储安平等的言论是反社会主义言论，难道是为了他一时说错了话吗？第二，参加反社会主义谬论的批判，是目前提高觉悟增进团结的最有效办法。大家都来参加批判，反对这些反党言论，自己立场站稳了，认识提高了，对于党的工作中的缺点，就必然会更有信心地更自觉地来提意见。这对于整风运动会有极大的好处。第三，整风运动进行的顺利与否，主要决定于领导上改正错误的决心。群众所要看的就在于这个决心大不大。领导积极改正错误，群众顾虑自然消除，同时团结也就显著增加。这是许多高等学校在运动的第一阶段中的经验已经充分证明的。第四，反社会主义言论本身就是反对整风运动的。这些另有居心的人（如在北大）已经说明“三害”越深对于他们越有利。他们一面散播毫无根据的诬蔑，一面嘲弄积极向党提意见的人，说“所揭露的都是皮毛没有触及本质”。不把这些败类的恶毒阴谋彻底暴露，就要使正直的人们垂头丧气。要想对反社会主义论者说，“闹由你闹，我整我的风”，这实际上办得到吗？
    因此，我认为对右派充分地进行批判不但不妨碍整风，而且对整风运动会有很大的好处。
