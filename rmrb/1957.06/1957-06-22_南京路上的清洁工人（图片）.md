　　Nanjing Road Cleaning Workers

　　Shanghai's most bustling street, Nanjing Road, has become Shanghai's cleanest street thanks to the round-the-clock cleaning by sanitation workers and the active cooperation of shop assistants along the street.
                    Wang Chaozhen, Lu Yongzhen (Labor Daily manuscript)

　　Yin Zhisong, a nearly sixty-year-old sanitation worker on Nanjing Road, has been working for thirty-five years. He sweeps the road more than twenty times every day.

　　The diligent garbage removal workers clear more than three tons of garbage from Nanjing Road and nearby alleys every day, sending it to the wharf for the farmer brothers to transport it to fertilize the fields.

　　南京路上的清洁工人
    上海最热闹的街道——南京路，由于清洁工人的日夜打扫和街旁商店店员的积极配合，已成为上海最清洁的街道。

　　近六十岁的南京路清洁工人殷志松，已经有三十五年的工龄了。他每天总要把路面打扫二十多次。
　　勤劳的清运工人，每天要从南京路和附近的里弄中清除出三吨多垃圾，送到码头上，让农民弟兄运去肥田。
