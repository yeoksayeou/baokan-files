Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 4th: The Kerala government of India recently launched a mass movement against grain hoarding. Committees of various parties and "supervision teams" have been established in villages, districts, streets, and towns to monitor speculators and those who hoard for profiteering.

Since the parliament passed the anti-hoarding bill last week, the Kerala government, led by the Communist Party of India, has been the first to take emergency measures to cope with the serious food situation.

Under normal circumstances, Kerala relies on imports for half of its annual grain needs. This year's poor harvest has made the situation even more serious. Kerala requested the central government to allocate 120,000 tons of rice, but only 75,000 tons were approved.

Kerala has also adopted a "card system" to control food grains, so that the insufficient supply of grain does not fall into the hands of hoarders and to protect the poorer residents from being exploited by high prices.

It is reported that these measures of the state government have aroused enthusiastic response. All political parties have participated in the mass committees, and the trade union and farmer organization workers are playing a leading role.

Currently, several states in India are facing serious food shortages. According to the all-India index, rice prices have already risen by 14.6% in the first four months of this year.

    印度喀拉拉邦政府维护贫民利益
    采取措施取缔囤粮
    据新华社新德里4日电　印度喀拉拉邦最近发动了一个群众性的反囤积粮食运动。各村、区、街、镇都成立了各党派委员会和“监督队”来监视投机倒把和囤积居奇的人。
    自从上星期议会通过反囤积的法案以来，印度共产党所领导的喀拉拉邦政府第一个采取紧急措施以应付严重的粮食情况。
    在通常的情况下，喀拉拉邦每年需要的粮食一半要靠输入。今年粮食歉收，情况更为严重。喀拉拉邦请求中央政府调拨十二万吨大米，但是获得批准的只有七万五千吨。
    喀拉拉邦还采用了控制食粮的“卡片制”，使供应不足的粮食不致落入囤户手中，并且使较贫困的居民免遭高价压榨。
    据报道，邦政府的这些措施已经引起了热烈的反响。各政党都参加了群众性的委员会，而起带头作用的是工会和农民组织的工作人员。
    目前，印度好几个邦都面临着严重的缺乏粮食问题。根据全印度的指数计算，在今年头四个月中，米价已经上涨了14.6％。
