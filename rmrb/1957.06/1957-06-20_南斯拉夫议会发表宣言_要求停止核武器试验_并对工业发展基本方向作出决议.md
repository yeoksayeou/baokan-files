Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, June 19th: The session of the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia was held in Belgrade from the 16th to the 18th.

　　This session adopted a declaration calling for a halt to nuclear weapons testing. The declaration stated that, under the current circumstances, the entire issue of disarmament is one of the central issues in international relations. The declaration urged members of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee to reach an agreement on halting test explosions without delay, or at least to reach a temporary agreement to halt explosions.

　　The Federal National Assembly also adopted a resolution on the basic directions of Yugoslavia's industrial development in the future at this session. The resolution pointed out that Yugoslavia, in the post-war period, has established a strong industry and laid a potential technical foundation for the further development of other economic sectors. However, certain disproportionate phenomena have occurred in the development of industry, which are mainly reflected in the backwardness of power resources and raw material bases. Similarly, the training of new cadres has also lagged behind, and there are still some unresolved issues in the economic system.

　　The resolution emphasized that at the current level of industrial development, it is entirely possible to further increase industrial production, because it is largely possible to utilize previously underutilized production capacity. Future industrial investment must mainly be used in those economic sectors in order to increase exports, reduce imports, produce more consumer goods, improve market conditions, make better use of domestic raw materials, and ensure the planned development of agriculture and transportation. The resolution mentioned that industrial production is expected to increase by 10% to 12% annually in this coming period.

　　南斯拉夫议会发表宣言
　　要求停止核武器试验
　　并对工业发展基本方向作出决议
    据新华社贝尔格莱德19日电  南斯拉夫联邦国民议会会议从16日到18日在贝尔格莱德举行。
    这次会议通过了要求停止核武器试验的宣言。宣言说，在目前情况下，整个裁军问题是国际关系中的中心问题之一。宣言要求联合国裁军小组委员会的成员毫不迟延地达成停止试验爆炸的协议，至少是达成暂时停止爆炸的协议。
    联邦国民议会在这次会议上还通过了南斯拉夫工业今后发展的基本方向的决议。决议指出，南斯拉夫在战后时期内，建立了强大的工业，奠定了其他经济部门进一步发展的潜在的技术基础。但是，在工业的发展中发生了某些不合比例的现象，这主要表现在动力资源、原料基地的落后上。同样，新干部的训练工作也落后了，在经济制度方面还有某些尚未解决的问题。
    决议着重指出，在工业发展目前的水平上工业生产完全有可能进一步增加，因为在很大程度上可以利用以前没有充分发挥的生产能力。今后工业的投资主要必须用于那些经济部门，以便增加出口，减少入口，生产更多的消费品，改善市场状况，更好地利用国内的原料，并且保证农业和运输业的有计划的发展。决议提到在今后这一时期内工业生产预期每年将增加10％到12％。
