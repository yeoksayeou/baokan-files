    Publication of a Collection of Essays Commemorating the October Revolution
    The "Cultural Publishing House" in Belgrade is currently compiling a collection of essays commemorating the October Socialist Revolution. This book will be one of a series of commemorative publications dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Yugoslavia.

    A report to be read at the commemorative meeting in Belgrade on November 7th has been selected as the preface. The book will include a series of essays on the October Revolution written by Lenin and others, as well as memoirs and discussions by contemporaries about Lenin and other prominent figures and events of the October Revolution, and articles discussing the profound impact of the October Revolution on other countries. A section of the book will be devoted to the revolutionary activities of the Yugoslav people in 1918 and 1919. President Tito's activities during the October Revolution will also be mentioned.

    Construction of 35,000-Ton Oil Tankers
    The "Split" shipyard will begin construction this year on two oil tankers each weighing 35,000 tons. Each oil tanker will be 200 meters long and 27 meters wide, and will be equipped with a 16,000-horsepower engine. These will be the heaviest ships built in Yugoslavia to date. In addition, Yugoslav shipbuilding enterprises have also received orders from foreign countries for the production of two oil tankers each weighing 25,000 tons.

    Large-Scale Export of Electrical Equipment
    Yugoslavia now exports electrical equipment to thirty countries. Major exports include telegraph machines, generators, and transformers. Yugoslavia's electrical industry is now capable of supplying domestic needs with 100,000 small generators annually. These generators also have considerable sales in the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. Last year, Yugoslavia exported 20,000 generators to India, and also sold a large amount of power generation equipment to Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.

    Invention of a Multi-Language Typewriter
    The "Topos" typewriter factory in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, will soon produce a typewriter capable of typing multiple languages. This typewriter was invented by Mihajlo Velimirović, an amateur mechanical engineer and Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.

    This typewriter is equipped with Latin, Yugoslav, Greek, Arabic, and Gothic typefaces, as well as many punctuation marks, including specialized symbols used in arithmetic, chemistry, technology, music, and medicine. Therefore, it greatly expands the functionality of the typewriter. The entire typewriter is equipped with approximately 360 letters and symbols. This typewriter is easy to use and does not require any specialized training. (Attached picture)

　　南斯拉夫简讯
    出版十月革命纪念文集
    贝尔格莱德出版机构“文化出版社”正在编印一部十月社会主义革命的纪念文集。这部书将是南斯拉夫专为十月革命四十周年而出版的一整套纪念丛书里面的一种。
    将要在贝尔格莱德11月7日的纪念会上宣读的一篇报告被选作序言。这部书将包括列宁和其它一些人所写的关于十月革命的一系列论文，还有当时的人关于列宁和十月革命的一些杰出人物和事件写的回忆和论述十月革命对其它国家的巨大影响的一些文章。书中有一部分将专门论述南斯拉夫人民在1918年和1919年的革命活动。铁托总统在十月革命时期的活动也将被提到。
    建造三万五千吨油船
    “斯普里特”造船厂今年将要开始建造两艘各重三万五千吨的油船。每一艘油船的长度为两百公尺，宽度为二十七公尺，分别安装有一万六千匹马力的发动机。这是到现在为止南斯拉夫所建造的吨位最重的船舶。此外，南斯拉夫的造船企业还接到了外国订购的两艘各重两万五千吨油船的生产任务。
    大量输出电气设备
    南斯拉夫现在向三十个国家输出电气设备。大宗出口的有电报机、发电机和变压器等。南斯拉夫的电气工业现在每年能以十万部小型发电机来供应国内需要。这种发电机在荷兰、德国和美国也有不小的销路。去年一年内，南斯拉夫曾向印度输出了两万部发电机，同时也向埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩销售了很多的发电设备。
    发明多种文字打字机
    南斯拉夫卢布尔雅纳的“托泼司”打字机工厂最近将要生产一种能打多种文字的打字机。这种打字机是由一位机械学业余爱好者、空军中校米哈伊洛·维利米洛维奇发明的。
    这种打字机上装有拉丁化文字、南斯拉夫文字、希腊文、阿拉伯文和哥德体活字，还有许多标点符号，包括在算术、化学、技术、音乐、医学上应用的一些专门符号。因此它大大地扩大了打字机的功能。整个打字机上安装有大约三百六十个字母和符号。这种打字机使用时很方便，不需要经过什么专门的训练。（附图片）
