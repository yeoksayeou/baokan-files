Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th. The summer locusts that appeared on more than 1.2 million mu of cultivated land in the Huanghai coast, the areas along the Weishan and Hongze lakes, and in the swamp areas of Jiangsu Province have been basically eliminated, and the work is now entering the mop-up phase.

During this locust control effort, the government allocated more than 3 million jin of locust control powder and more than 500 sprayers free of charge. In key locust areas such as Pei County and Xin'hailian City, airplanes and power sprayers were also used to help farmers spray and kill locusts. During the tense period of locust control, responsible cadres in Suqian and Pi County personally carried sprayers to the fields to control locusts. In order to do a better job of mopping up, agricultural cooperatives in various places also divided areas of responsibility, assigning scouts and sprayers to eliminate locusts on the spot when they were found. A locust eradication inspection system with fixed area, fixed point, fixed time, and fixed quality was also established.

Jiangsu Province is one of the main locust plague areas in China. Before liberation, it suffered from locust plagues every year, causing public anxiety. In 1939, during the Kuomintang rule, locust plagues occurred in Guanyun, Shuyang and other counties, not only were the rice seedlings in the fields eaten, but even the thatch on the roofs were eaten up, and a large number of farmers fled famine. After liberation, the government has organized and led locust control every year, and has never caused a locust plague. Moreover, more than 400,000 mu of locust-infested areas in the past have now become locust-free areas.

This newspaper's Baoding, 25th. Reporter Lu Sheng reports: According to incomplete statistics from 62 counties in 7 special districts, including Cang County and Baoding in Hebei Province, more than 3 million mu of land have been affected by flying locusts. Although farmers in various places have been actively catching and killing them in recent days, the locust plague is spreading rapidly due to the large area of new locust areas (accounting for 56% of the total area), coupled with insufficient preparation of medicines and machinery, and lack of experience among the masses.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued an emergency notice to Party committees throughout the province, requiring Party and government leading organs in locust-affected areas to immediately organize the masses to catch and kill locusts and eliminate flying locusts within a limited time.

The notice said that at present, the locusts in various places are large and migrating quickly. In terms of prevention and control methods, joint treatment must be carried out. It is hoped that special districts, special district counties, and counties will actively contact each other, exchange information, and encircle and annihilate each other. As for the supply of medicines and machinery, all transportation forces must be mobilized to transport them day and night.

### 江苏夏蝗基本扑灭  河北飞蝗迅速蔓延

　　江苏夏蝗基本扑灭
    河北飞蝗迅速蔓延
    新华社南京27日电  江苏省黄海边、微山、洪泽湖沿岔及草荡地带，一百二十多万亩耕地上发生的夏蝗，已基本上消灭，现正进入扫残阶段。
    这次治蝗中，政府无价拨发治蝗药粉三百多万斤，喷药器五百多架，在沛县、新海连市等重点蝗区还使用了飞机和动力喷粉器帮助农民喷杀蝗虫。治蝗紧张时期，宿迁、邳县的负责干部都亲自背上喷粉器下地治蝗。各地农业社为了更好的做好扫残工作，还划片包干分有侦查员、喷杀手，发现蝗虫就地消灭。并订出定面、定点、定期、定质的灭蝗检查制度。
    江苏省是我国主要蝗害区之一，解放前年年受蝗害，弄得人心不安。1939年国民党统治时期灌云、沭阳等县发生蝗灾，不但田里禾苗都被吃掉，连屋顶上的茅草都被吃光，大量农民外出逃荒。解放后，政府每年有组织有领导的进行治蝗，从来没有酿成蝗灾。并且已有四十多万亩过去飘蝗的地区现在变为无蝗区了。
    本报保定25日电  记者鲁生报道：据河北省沧县、保定等七个专区的六十二个县不完全统计，已有三百多万亩土地发生飞蝗。近日来虽经各地农民积极捕打，但是因为新蝗区面积大（占总面积的56％），加上药械准备不足，群众缺乏经验等原因，蝗灾蔓延很快。
    中共河北省委员会已向全省各地党委发出紧急通知，要求蝗区的党政领导机关立即组织群众捕打蝗虫，限期消灭飞蝗。
    通知说，目前各地蝗虫已大，迁移很快，在防治方法上必须联合除治，希各专区和专区县和县要主动联系，互通情报，互相围歼。至于药械供应，要调动一切运输力量，昼夜赶运。
