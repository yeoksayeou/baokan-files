An Elderly Farmer's Anger Towards the Rightists
He said: If anyone wants to kill the Communist Party, we will bury them under our sickles and hoes!
    (Our Dispatch) Liang Yingchun, a 71-year-old man from Wanling Township, Jingxing County, Hebei Province, sent a letter to this newspaper saying: I am an old farmer of 71 years old. After my child read to me the news published in the People's Daily about Ge Peiqi's anti-socialist remarks, I really couldn't hold back. Now, I am asking my child to write a letter for me to express my feelings.
    Ge Peiqi said: The masses can kill communists because the Communist Party does not serve the people. Who is he speaking for? People like me have lived through the rule of the Manchu emperors, Yuan Shikai, and Chiang Kai-shek. During the rule of those bastards like the Manchu emperors, the suffering of us common people was endless. Only after the Communist Party came did we feel the happiness of being human, with no worries about food and clothing, free from oppression and humiliation, living carefree lives. Ten years ago, in our village of more than two hundred households, only three or five families didn't eat chaff and vegetables; now, you can't find a single family eating chaff. Ten years ago, people didn't have clothes to wear, mending them over and over again; now, they all wear good clothes. In the past, we burned firewood from the mountains; now, we use coal stoves. The benefits are endless. We are very clear about where these good days come from. We are of one heart with the Communist Party and will always follow the Communist Party. If anyone wants to kill the Communist Party, we will bury them under our sickles and hoes.

　　七一老人对右派的愤怒
　　他说：谁要杀共产党，我们就让他们葬身于镰刀锄头之下！
    本报讯　河北省井陉县万岭乡七十一岁老人梁迎春给本报来信说：我是七十一岁的老农民，孩子给我念了人民日报登载的葛佩琦发表反社会主义言论的消息以后，我实在蹩不住了，现在托我的孩子替我写封信，说说我的心里话。
    葛佩琦说：群众可以杀共产党人，因为共产党不为人民服务。这是替谁说话？像我这样的人，是经过满清皇帝统治、袁世凯统治和蒋介石统治几个朝代。在满清皇帝等等这些王八羔子统治时期，俺老百姓受的苦难说不完。共产党来了，俺们才觉到作人的幸福，不愁穿不愁吃，不受压迫侮辱，过着无忧无虑的日子。十年前，俺村二百余户，只有三、五家不吃糠菜，现在找不到一家吃糠的。十年前没穿的，衣服补了又补，现在都穿上好衣裳。过去烧山柴，现在是生煤火炉，好处是说不完的。俺们很清楚这些好日子怎么来的，俺们和共产党结成一条心，永远跟着共产党走。谁要杀共产党，我们就让他们葬身在镰刀锄头之下。
