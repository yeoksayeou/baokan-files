\tLondon dispatch from our newspaper, June 27th: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opened on the morning of the 26th at 10 Downing Street. Unlike previous conferences, there have been many changes in the membership. Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah, as a leader of a new, independent African nation, is participating in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference for the first time; Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker replaced Louis St. Laurent in London. The Union of South Africa, Ceylon, and New Zealand are represented by senior ministers at this conference.
\tThe meeting is being held in absolute secrecy. It is understood that the meeting on the 26th mainly reviewed the international situation. Macmillan is trying to get everyone to forget the "Suez" scar and unite the Commonwealth in order to restore and consolidate Britain's position. It is noteworthy that the "Times" reported on the 26th that this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference "will consider the consequences of the Suez War and the impact of changes in the balance of world power over the past twelve months." One of the important contents of the "change" mentioned here is that the United States has replaced Britain's position in the Middle East.
\tA few days ago, British Defense Minister Sandys made an eleven-day visit to the Middle East and Africa. Sandys's task is to redeploy and adjust British military forces in the Middle East. The plan to transfer the British Middle East Command from Cyprus to Kenya and turn the latter into an atomic base has been put forward. This plan (which will be brought up for discussion at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference) is aimed at the liberation movements of the people in the Middle East and Africa, and at the same time, it is to deal with the rapid expansion of American power in this region.
\tMacmillan is asking Commonwealth countries to cooperate on the Middle East issue in order to resist American pressure. Public opinion here doubts whether this effort will have significant results, because it is difficult to expect unanimous support from all Commonwealth countries for the British government's current Middle East policy.

　　英联邦总理会议在伦敦开幕
    英国力图团结各成员国恢复它的地位
    本报伦敦27日电  英联邦总理会议已于26日上午在唐宁街十号开幕。和过去历届会议不同的是，与会的成员有了很多变更。加纳总理恩克鲁玛作为一个新的、独立的非洲国家的领导人员，第一次参加联邦总理会议；加拿大的新总理迪芬贝克，代替了圣劳伦来到了伦敦。南非联邦、锡兰、新西兰是由高级部长出席这次会议的。
    会议是在绝对秘密的情况下举行的。据悉，26日的会议主要是审查国际局势。麦克米伦力求大家忘掉“苏伊士”这个疮疤，把英联邦团结起来，以恢复和巩固英国的地位。值得注意的是，26日的“泰晤士报”报道说：本届联邦总理会议“将考虑苏伊士战争的后果，过去十二个月来世界力量对比改变的影响。”这里所说的“改变”，其重要内容之一就是美国取代了英国在中东的地位。
    几天以前，英国国防大臣桑迪斯在中东和非洲作了为时十一天的访问。桑迪斯的任务是重新部署与调整英国在中东的军事力量。把英国的中东司令部从塞浦路斯转移到怯尼亚并把后者变为原子基地的计划，已被提出来了。这个计划（它将被提到联邦总理会议上去讨论）一方面是针对中东和非洲地区人民的解放运动的，同时也是为了对付美国势力在这个地区的急剧扩张。
    麦克米伦要求联邦国家在中东问题上进行合作，以抵制美国的压力。这种努力能否有显著结果，此间舆论表示怀疑。因为英国政府现行的中东政策，很难指望获得所有的联邦国家的一致支持。
