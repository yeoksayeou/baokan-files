The thriving scene in Beijing on June 15th:
The best contrast to the tragic life on the same day ten years ago!
Ten Years Ago Today

Ten years ago today—June 16, 1947—was an extremely ordinary day. What kind of local news did the Beijing newspapers publish that day? What happened to the things described in those news stories today? Here are today's reports on those "news."

"A Mad World"

Opening the Beijing newspapers from ten years ago today is shocking. Every newspaper published the news of rising grain prices with large headlines. "Citizens Cry for Help, Help! Grain Prices Soar Again Yesterday" was the headline in the "Peiping Times." "How Can Citizens Live? Grain Prices Fall Slightly but Rise Sharply, Yesterday Another Frantic Increase" was the headline in the "Tao Bao." "Grain Prices Rise Madly, Citizens Shout Madly, Simply Entering a Mad World" was the headline in the "Yishi Bao."

To understand today's grain price situation, the reporter came to the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau. The agency specifically managing grain prices has long been abolished. Now, only two people in the administrative section manage "grading and pricing," doing only research on the quality of grain. They said that information on the changes in grain prices in Beijing is historical data, and because it hasn't been used for a long time, it has been archived. After searching for a long time, they found a thick, dust-covered volume, and found the record for 1947. It recorded that if the price of a bag of flour in January was taken as 100, it was already 517 in June, and rose even higher to 1363 in December. They also found the 1948 record: In June 1947, a bag of flour cost 240,000 "Legal Tender," but by June 1948, it sold for 6.56 million, and rose as high as 26.93 million in August. Due to the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants and runaway inflation, grain prices were rising at astronomical rates.

However, this phenomenon completely changed after liberation, especially after the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain. A staff member of the Beijing Grain Bureau told the reporter: The current grain reserves in Beijing are more abundant than at any time in history. Grain prices have now completely stabilized, and even the seasonal price differences during the lean months of late summer and early autumn have been completely eliminated. Several hundred grain merchants who used to engage in speculation and profiteering have, after socialist transformation, now become business personnel selling grain on behalf of the state. Today, no one is panic-stricken, fearing that grain prices will rise, and rushing to buy grain as soon as they receive their salary.

Had to Check the Archives

The newspapers from ten years ago today also published news that Beijing electricity prices had risen by 85%. According to the reporter's memory, Beijing newspapers have rarely or almost never published similar news since liberation. When the reporter went to the Electricity Bureau to inquire, even the director of the Electricity Bureau and the director of the business office could not remember when the current electricity price was set. To answer the reporter's question, the director of the business office had to call someone to check the archives. In the meantime, the reporter asked them to talk about the development of electricity supply since liberation. To summarize a lot of numbers in one sentence, the current power consumption is four times greater than in 1949.

The phone rang, and the director of the business office laughed as he listened to the phone. It turned out that the person checking the archives said that electricity prices changed every month before liberation, and there was no way to compare them with the present. He found in the archives that the current electricity price was set in October 1951, at 1,480 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which is now 14.8 fen.

Simply Incomparable!

In the "World Evening News," a small news item complained about "the difficulty of getting around." The news said that the number of trams on the ring road had been reduced from sixteen to six, and waiting for a tram took forty minutes.

How many trams are there on the ring road today? A staff member of the Passenger Transport Section of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Bureau said that there are now sixty-three trams on the ring road, plus the four-way trams on the half-ring road, for a total of seventy-five, and a tram can be waited for every four or five minutes. They turned out a large pile of statistics, trying to compare the transportation situation in Beijing ten years ago. Ten years ago, the total number of trams and buses running in Beijing was ninety-nine, while now it is seven hundred and eighteen, with more than forty routes, carrying more than 1.4 million passengers every day. In addition, there are one hundred and thirty-seven taxis, which Beijing never had in the past.

The reporter asked them to check how many trams and buses there were in the best year under the Kuomintang rule. According to the investigation: The most trams were in 1937, with seventy-five; the most buses were in 1947, with forty. If the two items could be added together, it would only be one hundred and fifteen.

Three staff members from the section told the reporter: It's simply incomparable.

Changes in Schools

Ten years ago today, many newspapers in Beijing published the news of student strikes at Tsinghua University, Peking University, and other schools with striking headlines. The news wrote: The Peking University Anti-Hunger and Anti-Civil War Action Committee announced that in protest of the "Wuhan June 1st Massacre" and demanding the release of arrested students across the country, it decided to strike for one day and express deep condolences to the victims.

This painful day is now exactly ten years ago. Walking into today's Peking University, the campus is covered with trees, the buildings are staggered, and on the green grass, by the Weiming Lake, college students are in twos and threes, reviewing their lessons with books, actively preparing for exams.

Zhang Qunyu, who led the student movement at Peking University ten years ago, is now the deputy secretary of the Peking University Party Committee. When the reporter asked her to talk about the comparison between ten years ago and today, she sat on the sofa and thought for a while and said, the question you raised is too sudden. We are now living a completely different life, and I rarely think about what happened ten years ago. I remember that it was when the Kuomintang adopted a high-pressure policy against students. Student gatherings at Peking University were often surrounded by military police, and progressive students were in danger of being arrested at any time.

The reporter also went to the office of the Student Union. Zhao Zhenjiang, the chairman of the Student Union, is a very young college student, and the persecution suffered by college students ten years ago is unfamiliar to him. He said, I can only learn about these things from historical materials and novels. The college student life I see is a carefree, free, and happy life. Since 1952, the food supply for college students has been completely borne by the government. From the second half of last year, it was changed to scholarships, but on average, 60% of the students in the school enjoy scholarships. In the past, students had to fight against persecution. Now, the school has arranged a good learning environment for us, and we can completely concentrate on studying and exploring various knowledge.

Xu Deheng, a former professor at Peking University, also talked to the reporter about the situation at Peking University ten years ago. He said that students were often arrested by secret agents in the school at that time, which was really terrifying, and students could not study with peace of mind. He said excitedly, today's situation does not need me to compare.

Hard to Find Construction News

The reporter wanted to find some construction news in the newspapers from ten years ago today, but it was a difficult task. Finally, a similar news item was found in the "North China Daily." This news had a very eye-catching headline: "Improvement of Telecommunications Services," and a subtitle: "Telephones Have Reached 20,000 Numbers." But the content was empty, without any shadow of construction.

The reporter interviewed Chen Guangpu, an engineer who joined the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau in 1943, about this news. He is now the deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau. After listening to the reporter talk about this news, he smiled and said that there was no talk of improving business at that time. He said: Now there are more than 40,000 telephone numbers in Beijing, and with small switchboards, there are actually more than 70,000 telephones in use. There are now twenty-four telephone bureaus, and there were only twelve at that time. Most of the increase is in automatic telephones. He said: After liberation, I participated in the largest telephone project in Beijing's history: expanding the three, four, and five bureaus, and building the six and eight bureaus. He quickly added: This is unprecedented, but not the last. We are now building the ninth bureau, which is another 2,000 numbers, and it will be completed this year. At the same time, we are considering the second five-year plan, and the construction scale will be larger than the first five-year plan.

Incomparable Comparison

The reporter browsed through eleven newspapers from June 16, 1947. These newspapers published many things that happened in Beijing the day before, such as conscripting soldiers, store sales, forcing good people into prostitution, and so on. In the new society, these things have long disappeared.

At the end of this interview, the reporter passed through several main streets of Beijing. June 15th was a weekend, the streets were brightly lit, the department stores and shops in Wangfujing were crowded; the restaurants and cold food stores were full; the cinemas and theaters hung out "sold out" signs; the pedestrians on the road were bustling, everyone was happy. Dear readers, isn't this prosperous scene the best contrast to the tragic society of ten years ago?

### 六月十五日北京的一片繁荣景象  不就是十年前同一天悲惨生活的最好对比吗？十年前的今天

　　六月十五日北京的一片繁荣景象
    不就是十年前同一天悲惨生活的最好对比吗？
　　十年前的今天
　　新华社记者  新辰　昭文  恭敏　赵谦
    十年前的今天——1947年的6月16日是个极其普通的一天。北京的报纸上在这一天刊登了一些什么地方新闻呢？这些新闻里叙述的事情今天怎么样了？下面就是这些“新闻”的今日报道。
    “疯狂世界”
    翻开十年前今天的北京各家报纸，令人触目惊心。每一家报纸都以大字标题刊载了粮食涨价的消息。“市民疾呼救命，救命！粮价昨日又突猛涨”这是“北平时报”的标题。“市民怎么活？粮价小落大涨，昨又疯狂上升”这是“道报”的标题。“粮价拚命涨，市民拚命喊，简直入了疯狂世界”这是“益世报”的标题。
    为了了解今天的粮食价格问题，记者来到了北京市粮食局。这里早已取消了专门管理粮食价格的机构，现在只有两个人在行政科里管“分等论价”，做的仅是粮食质量优劣的研究工作。他们说，关于北京市粮食价格变化的情况，已是历史资料了，因为很久不用，已经存档。他们找了半天才找出了一个上面尘土很厚的大本子，查到1947年，上面记载的是：一袋面粉的价格若以1月份为一百，6月份就已经是五百一十七，12月更高至一千三百六十三。他们又翻出了1948年的记载：1947年6月一袋面粉是“法币”二十四万，到1948年6月卖到六百五十六万，8月更高达二千六百九十三万元。由于当时奸商的投机活动和恶性的通货膨胀，粮食简直是以天文数字在涨价。
    但是，这种现象在解放以后尤其是粮食实行了统购统销后，就完全变了样。北京粮食局工作人员对记者说：现在北京市储存的粮食比历史上任何时期都充裕。现在粮价完全稳定下来，就连几十年来夏秋青黄不接时的季节差价也完全消除了。几百户过去投机倒把的粮商，经过社会主义改造，现在已经成为国家代卖粮食的业务人员。今天，没有人再惶惶恐恐地唯恐粮食涨价，一发薪就赶快去抢买粮食的了。
    不得不查档案
    十年前今天的报纸上还登载了北京电力涨了85％的消息，根据记者的记忆，解放后北京各报很少或几乎没有登过类似的新闻。当记者到电业局查询的时候，连电业局局长、营业所主任也记不起现在的电价究竟是什么时候订的。为了回答记者的问题，营业所主任不得不打电话请人查档案。在这空隙，记者请他们谈一下解放后电力供应的发展情况。把很多数字概括成一句话，就是现在的用电量比1949年增加了四倍。
    电话铃响了，营业所主任听着电话就笑了起来，原来查档案人说，解放前电价一月一个样子，根本无法和现在比。他从档案上查到现在的电价是1951年10月订的，每度电当时是一千四百八十元，也就是现在的一角四分八。
    简直不能比！
    “世界晚报”上，一条小新闻在埋怨“行路难”。新闻里说，环行路电车已由十六辆减到六辆，等一次车要四十分钟。
    今天环行路的电车有多少？北京市交通运输局客运科的工作人员说，现在环行路电车有六十三辆，加上半环行的四路车，一共有七十五辆，每四、五分钟就可以等到一辆。他们翻出了一大堆统计资料，试图来比较一下十年前北京市的交通情况。十年前北京全市行驶的电车和公共汽车总数是九十九辆，而现在是七百一十八辆，线路四十多条，每天载运乘客达一百四十多万人次。此外，还有北京过去从来没有过的出租小汽车一百三十七辆。
    记者请他们查查国民党统治时期电车、公共汽车最多一年究竟有多少辆。据调查是：电车1937年最高，有七十五辆；公共汽车1947年最高，四十辆。两项若是可以加起来的话也只有一百一十五辆。
    三个科的工作人员向记者说：简直不能比。
    学校里的变化
    十年前的今天，北京的许多家报纸都以鲜明的标题刊登着清华大学、北京大学等校学生罢课的消息，消息写道：北大反饥饿反内战行动委员会通告称，为抗议“武大六一惨案”和要求释放各地被捕学生，决定罢课一天，并对死难者表示沉痛追悼。
    这个沉痛的日子距今已整整十年了。走进今天的北京大学，校园里林木遮天，楼阁参差，青草地上，未名湖畔，大学生们两两三三，正在拿着书本温习功课，积极准备考试。
    十年前在北大领导学生运动的张群玉现在是中共北大党委会的副书记。当记者请她谈谈十年前同今天的对比时，她坐在沙发上默想了好一会说，你提的这个问题太突然了。现在过的是完全另一种生活，十年前的事我已经很少想它了，记得那时正是国民党对学生采取高压政策的时候，北大学生集会常被军警包围，进步的学生每时每刻都有被捕的危险。
    记者又到了学生会的办公室。学生会主席赵震江是一个非常年轻的大学生，十年前大学生所遭受的迫害，对他来说是陌生的。他说，我只能从历史材料和小说里得知这些事情，我所看到的大学生生活是无忧无虑自由幸福的生活。1952年开始，大学生的伙食供应完全由政府来负担，从去年下半年改成了助学金，但全校享受助学金的同学平均有60％。过去的学生要反迫害，现在学校里给我们安排了良好的学习环境，我们完全可以专心致志地学习，探求各种知识。
    前北京大学教授许德珩也对记者畅谈了十年前北京大学的情况。他说，那时学校里经常都有学生被特务抓走，真是人心惶惶，学生不能安心学习。他激动地说，今天是什么样子，已经不需要我来对比了。
    难找的建设新闻
    记者很想在十年前今天的报纸上找一些建设的新闻，但这是一件困难的事。好容易在“华北日报”上找到了一条类似的新闻。这条消息有一个很醒目的标题：“电信业务改进”，还有一个小标题：“电话已达二万号”。但是内容空洞，没有一点建设的影子。
    记者就这条新闻访问了1943年就参加北京电信局工作的工程师陈光璞，他现在是北京市市内电话局的副局长。他听记者谈了这条新闻以后，笑着说，当时根本谈不到什么改进业务。他说：现在北京的电话是四万多号，加上小交换机，实际上使用的电话达七万多部。电话局现在是二十四个，当时只有十二个。增加的绝大部分是自动电话。他说：解放后我参加了北京有史以来的最大的电话工程：扩建三、四、五局，新建六、八局。他赶快补充说：这是空前，但不是绝后的，现在我们正在建设九局，又是两千号，今年就可以完工。同时，我们正在考虑第二个五年计划，建设规模将比第一个五年计划还大。
    不能对比的对比
    记者翻阅了十一家1947年6月16日的报纸，这些报纸上刊载了许多北京在前一天发生的事情，如抓壮丁、商店大拍卖、迫良为娼等等。在新社会里，这些事情早已无迹可寻了。
    记者在结束这次采访的时候，路过北京的几条主要大街。15日正是周末，街头灯火辉煌，王府井的百货大楼和商店里拥挤不堪；餐馆、冷食店座无虚席；电影院、戏院挂出了客满的牌子；路上行人熙熙攘攘，个个兴高采烈。亲爱的读者，这一片繁荣景象，不就是十年前悲惨社会的最好对比吗？
