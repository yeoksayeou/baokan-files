Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's long-awaited speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

On the evening of the 18th, the wired broadcasting stations of many units in the Nanjing troops broadcast the full text of Chairman Mao's speech. Many comrades listened to it twice in a row. The officers and soldiers of a certain naval vessel on the coastal defense front gathered around loudspeakers on the deck and in the living quarters, listening intently to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's speech. Many officers and soldiers living in the city also bought newspapers containing Chairman Mao's speech and read them carefully and attentively.

After listening to and reading Chairman Mao's speech, many officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army believed that at a time when rectification and the counterattack against the rightists' anti-socialist remarks are underway, this speech has given everyone new ideological weapons, making their eyes brighter and the line between right and wrong clearer. Liu Bingnan of a certain air force unit said that Chairman Mao's speech on what constitutes the people, what constitutes the enemy, and the six political criteria for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has once again pointed out the direction for us, enabling us to stand firm, distinguish between right and wrong, and increase our confidence and strength in the struggle to counterattack the rightists who are taking advantage of the rectification opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on our party. Zhang Xusan, captain of a certain naval vessel, said that people can use the six criteria indicated by Chairman Mao to distinguish between what is a fragrant flower and what is a poisonous weed. Many officers and soldiers stationed in Beijing expressed that they must use Chairman Mao's speech as a weapon, strive to improve their ideological understanding, learn to distinguish between right and wrong, stand firm, and launch a resolute struggle against the reactionary remarks of the rightists.

After Chairman Mao's speech was published, the leading organs of many troops immediately issued instructions to their subordinate units to study Chairman Mao's speech. The Political Department of the Wuhan Troops has decided that all troops will spend two weeks studying Chairman Mao's speech.

    眼睛更明亮、是非更清楚、信心更坚定
    解放军官兵学习毛主席的报告
    新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵，热烈学习渴望已久的毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。
    18日傍晚，南京部队很多单位的有线广播台，都转播了毛主席讲演的全文。很多同志连续听了两遍。海防前线某舰的官兵，聚集在甲板上和住舱里的扩音器周围，全神贯注地收听了毛主席讲演的广播。许多住在城市的官兵，还买了刊有毛主席讲演的报纸，聚精会神地仔细阅读。
    人民解放军许多官兵在收听和阅读了毛主席的讲演以后，都认为正当进行整风和反击右派反社会主义言论的时候，这个讲演给了大家新的思想武器，使大家眼睛更明亮了，是非界限更清楚了。空军某部刘炳南说，毛主席讲演里关于什么是人民、什么是敌人，以及“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的六条政治标准，又一次给我们指明了方向，使我们能够在右派分子利用整风机会向我党疯狂进攻中，更能站稳立场，分清是非界限，使我们在反击右派分子的斗争中，增加了信心和力量。海军某舰舰长张序三说，人们可以用毛主席所指示的六条标准去鉴别什么是鲜花，什么是毒草。北京驻军许多官兵表示，一定要以毛主席的讲演作为武器，努力提高自己的思想认识，学会明辨是非，站稳立场，对右派分子的反动言论，展开坚决的斗争。
    许多部队领导机关在毛主席讲演发表后，立即向所属部队发出了学习毛主席讲演的指示。武汉部队政治部已经决定各部队以两周时间学习毛主席的讲演。
