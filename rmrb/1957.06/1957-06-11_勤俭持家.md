Sisters of Shanghai: I Have Not Disappointed Your Hopes

　　In 1954, Wang Peizhen encouraged her husband, Huang Ruomei, to participate in the key construction project at the Shouwangfen Copper Mine in Chengde City, Hebei. In November of the following year, women from the Xuhui District of Shanghai joyfully sent her off to the north again.

　　Having lived in Shanghai for a long time, Wang Peizhen found life inconvenient in many ways when she arrived at the copper mine. In Shanghai, they slept on spring beds; here, they slept on earthen platforms. In Shanghai, they ate rice; here, they ate sorghum and millet. In Shanghai, they burned coal briquettes; here, they burned thatch. In Shanghai, they used electric lights, which were bright and clear; here, they used oil lamps and candles, which were expensive and dim. In Shanghai, they drank tap water, which was very convenient; here, they drank well water, the well shafts were deep, and they had to draw and carry it themselves. In Shanghai, they walked on roads and took trams; here, there were stones everywhere, not a proper road in sight. Being unfamiliar with the place was not the main problem; the main problem was not being able to adapt to the climate and environment, getting sick. The more she lay in bed, the more she thought of Shanghai, the more she felt that Shanghai was better. Once, she unintentionally said to her husband, "With such poor conditions here, I'm afraid I'll lose my life!" Old Huang said, "Didn't you say in your letter, 'No matter what, I will resolutely not be a deserter from the cause of construction'?" These words evoked Wang Peizhen's memories; she remembered her relatives and friends' hopes for her, and she remembered the determination she had announced to everyone. "How could I face people if I returned to Shanghai? Could it be that I can't overcome even these difficulties for the sake of the motherland's socialist construction?" So she made up her mind to persevere.

　　In Shanghai, Wang Peizhen was an alternate member of the Municipal Women's Federation Executive Committee, a representative of the Xuhui District People's Congress, and the director of the residents' committee, working actively and gaining the support of the masses. In this new position at Shouwangfen, she launched a struggle against difficulties. Unable to understand the local dialect, she first learned the northern dialect from others. When the children became emotional, she educated them and assigned them some housework, the older ones cooking, washing clothes, fetching water, and sweeping the floor, the younger ones looking after the children. In order to save on the expense of buying firewood, she went up the mountain to learn how to chop wood. For someone like Wang Peizhen who had lived in the city for so long, chopping wood was really not easy; she didn't know how to climb mountains or use a sickle. Others chopped large bundles, while she only chopped a little. But she was not discouraged and was not afraid of hardship. With the help of her neighbors, she quickly learned how to climb mountains and the technique of chopping wood. Except for spending five yuan when she first arrived at the mine to buy more than four hundred catties of firewood, she has not bought any firewood since. Wang Peizhen also used the open space to plant gourds, beans, and sorghum, tilling the land and saving seeds herself, and in the autumn, she had enough vegetables and grain. Relying on her own hands, Wang Peizhen overcame various difficulties, and her family of seven lived very well. In addition, her husband was promoted to an eighth-grade worker last year, and their work and production enthusiasm are even higher.

　　Wang Peizhen's work has also gradually expanded from her personal family scope to the entire mine. She said, "The Shouwangfen Copper Mine is a newly established unit, and the family members of workers transferred from Hunan, Hangzhou, Shenyang, and other places, like me, initially had some emotional fluctuations. I would empathize with them based on my personal experience and help them solve their difficulties, such as boiling water, clearing out rooms, lending firewood, and sending oil and salt, to make them feel warm, and introduce them to experiences in overcoming difficulties, reducing the trouble for the trade union and administration."

　　Wang Peizhen has received praise from the entire mine and has now been named an advanced family worker in the copper mine and an activist in the provincial and municipal trade unions. She is a representative of the Chengde City People's Congress, the deputy director of the Shouwangfen Mine Family Committee, the deputy town mayor, and has honorably joined the Communist Party. She said to the reporter, "Please tell the sisters of Shanghai: I have not disappointed your hopes."

　　Content with Agricultural Labor

　　Zhu Yurong's family lives in Baidaozi Village, Wangnianzhuang, on the outskirts of Tangshan City. The family of nine includes a mother-in-law and six children, the eldest daughter being only seventeen years old. Her husband, Yang Nian, is a third-grade coal selecting worker at the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine, earning more than forty-five yuan a month. Zhu Yurong said, "Don't look at how many people are in my family, but I have never applied for labor insurance subsidies. We rely on ourselves to overcome difficulties. Now our lives are getting better year by year. We have enough to eat and wear, and we have a surplus. The days of eating coarse grains and vegetables for half the year are over."

　　Zhu Yurong and her eldest daughter are both members of the agricultural cooperative. She herself is also a production team leader, planting sweet potatoes, carrying water, spreading manure, guiding the plow, planting seeds, and setting up trellises, she can do everything. In 1956, the mother and daughter totaled more than 2,400 work points, actually distributing more than 3,000 catties of various grains and more than 23 yuan in cash. By the end of May this year, they had already done more than 1,000 work points. Zhu Yurong also raises a fat pig herself. She said contentedly, "I fed the pig so it was round and plump. It weighed 172 catties when slaughtered. Besides leaving some for ourselves, we sold it for more than 50 yuan." Zhu Yurong never wastes a penny. She spins her own cotton thread, twists her own hemp thread, and all the clothes, shoes, and socks are sewn and mended by the mother and daughter. From November last year to February this year, they have made fourteen pairs of shoes, large and small, and two pairs of cloth socks, and they have taken apart and washed nineteen cotton-padded clothes clean. Saving and economizing in this way, she saves five yuan in the bank every month. Last year, Zhu Yurong also invested the small cart and donkey she had bought with others in the cooperative. At the same time, under Zhu Yurong's influence, 75% of the more than 280 worker dependents in the whole village participated in agricultural labor. She also mobilized a worker dependent from the public dormitory in the mining area to return and participate in the cooperative's labor.

　　Because Zhu Yurong's husband, Yang Nian, has no family burden, his work enthusiasm is particularly high. He never misses a shift, regardless of wind or rain. From the second quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, he has been named an advanced producer every quarter. Speaking of this, Zhu Yurong said excitedly, "I think this is not only Yang Nian's honor, but also the honor of our whole family. In the future, I will help him maintain this honorary title and help more worker dependents do a good job in household labor."

　　Lover – Assistant

　　Professor Chen Zibei's book "Concise Tutorial of Abacus Rapid Calculation" has been written, but the diagrams in it have not yet been drawn. Like the hundreds of past days and nights, he is now hunched over his desk, pondering and thinking hard. He is freehand drawing abacus beads one by one, but they are never drawn very round, crooked, and of different sizes. He once again took out the patterns he had carved and asked others to carve to try printing, but the result was still disappointing: the lines were of uneven thickness, some places too dark, and some not visible enough, very ugly. What to do?

　　"Take a break." His wife, Sun Shufang, poured a cup of lukewarm boiled water into the spittoon and poured him another hot cup, placing it on his desk. Appearing to complain, she was actually concerned, "Sitting all the time, not moving around, do you still want your health?"

　　As she spoke, she sat by the bed to mend clothes. He did not answer.

　　Sun Shufang has been married to him for more than thirty years, and both husband and wife have gray hair. In more than thirty years, they have never quarreled. In life, she cares for him meticulously; in work, she is also his assistant. She often says to relatives and friends, "Although my husband is a university professor, he is still like a diligent student. As soon as he gets home from class, he either buries himself in books or picks up a small knife and a small drill, carving this and drilling that, sometimes even forgetting to eat and sleep." Therefore, she always takes the initiative to shoulder the burden of household matters, whether it is firewood, rice, oil, and salt, or educating the children, so as not to worry him and affect his teaching and scientific research. Although, when her social work was busy, she had such thoughts, "It would be great if he could help me, buy groceries, and do some chores!" In order not to affect his work, she never said it, and she tried to overcome the difficulties herself. Her only anxiety is that she is not well-educated, and besides doing some administrative work in his research, she cannot help him with anything else. However, no matter how late he works on his research, she always accompanies him, as if this can help him resist the cold, heat, fatigue, and aging that silently attack him.

　　Since he returned from visiting the agricultural cooperative, he often told Sun Shufang that the peasant brothers had difficulties in bookkeeping and accounting, and that he wanted to speed up the writing of "Concise Tutorial of Abacus Rapid Calculation." Recently, comrades from the Henan People's Publishing House also came to urge him to submit the manuscript. If the diagrams are not drawn well, the book cannot be published. He is anxious, and she is also anxious.

　　"What can be used to solve the problem of drawing diagrams?" She sewed her children's torn clothes while searching for answers. Because she was multitasking, the needle often pricked her fingers. "Would it work to use wheat stalks?" She remembered playing with drawing circles with wheat stalks when she was a child.

　　"Zibei, would it work to use wheat stalk tubes to draw abacus beads?" She seemed suddenly enlightened and hurriedly told him the method she had thought of.

　　"Find some and try it."

　　She found the wheat stalks and cut them neatly, and he busied himself dipping them in the ink and printing them on the paper.

　　"Good, very good!" He was very happy to see two circles with clear lines, uniform size, and suitable size, "Now there is a way!"

　　The room was filled with the happy laughter of this old couple.

　　After the book was published, he always said to those who congratulated him, "This is thanks to the help at home."

　　本报记者  余药夫  张基福
　　上海的姐妹：我没有辜负你们的热望
    1954年，王佩珍鼓动自己的丈夫黄若梅，到河北承德市寿王坟铜矿参加了重点建设。第二年11月间，上海徐汇区的妇女们又欢送她北上。
    久居上海的王佩珍来到铜矿，感到生活处处不方便。在上海，睡的是棕床，这里睡的是土炕。在上海吃的是大米，这里吃的是高粱和小米。在上海烧的是煤球，这里烧的是毛草。在上海晚上用电灯，又明又亮，这里用的是油灯和蜡烛，又费钱又不亮。在上海吃的是自来水，用起来很方便，到这里吃的是井水，井筒很深全凭自己打、自己担。在上海出门走马路坐电车，这里到处是石头，没有一条正经路。人地生疏不要紧，主要的是水土不服，生病，越躺在床上越想上海，越感到上海好。有一次，她无意中对丈夫说：“这里条件这么不好，恐怕这条命要送在这里了！”老黄说：你不是在信上说：“不管人家怎么样，坚决不作建设事业上的逃兵吗？”这一句话勾起王佩珍的回忆，她想起了亲友们对她的希望，想起了自己曾向大家宣布的决心。“我回到上海怎么见人呢？难道为了祖国社会主义建设连这一点困难都克服不了吗？”于是她下定了决心，坚持下去。
    王佩珍在上海是市妇联会候补执委，徐汇区人民代表，居民委员会主任，工作积极，得到群众拥护。她在寿王坟这一新的岗位上，向困难展开了斗争。口音不懂，她就先跟别人学习北方话，孩子们闹情绪，就教育他们，分配他们做点家务劳动，大的做饭、洗衣、挑水、扫地，小的看孩子。为了节约买柴的开支，她上山学习打柴。像王佩珍这样久居城市的人，打柴真不容易，不会爬山，不会使镰刀。别人打一大捆，她只打一点。但是她没有灰心，也不怕吃苦，在邻居们帮助下，她很快学会了爬山的方法，学会了打柴的技术。除了刚到矿上时花了五元钱，买了四百多斤柴以外，一直到今天没有买过柴烧。王佩珍又利用空地种了窝瓜、豆角和高粱，自己翻地，自己养种，过秋有了足够的蔬菜和粮食。王佩珍靠着自己的双手，克服了种种困难，一家七口过的很好。再加她丈夫在去年又升为八级工，两人的工作和生产情绪更加高涨起来。
    王佩珍的工作也逐渐从个人的家庭范围扩大到全矿中去。她说：“寿王坟铜矿是一个新建单位，陆续从湖南、杭州、沈阳等地调来的工人家属跟我一样，起初情绪总有些波动，我就根据个人的体验，体贴他们，帮助他们解决困难。如烧开水，腾房子，借烧柴，送油盐，使他们感到温暖，介绍克服困难的经验，减少工会和行政的麻烦。”
    王佩珍受到了全矿的赞扬，现在已经被评为铜矿先进家属工作者和省、市工会积极分子。她是承德市的人民代表、寿王坟矿家属委员会副主任、镇里的副镇长，并且光荣地参加了共产党。她对记者说：“请你告诉上海的姐妹们：我没有辜负你们的热望”。
    安心农业劳动
    朱玉荣的家住在唐山市郊王辇庄白道子村，全家九口人，有一个婆婆，六个孩子，只大女儿十七岁。她的丈夫杨年是开滦赵各庄煤矿三级选煤工人，每月收入四十五元多。朱玉荣说：“不用看我家人多，可是我从来没有申请过劳保补助，有困难靠自己克服，现在我们的日子过的一年比一年好，有吃有穿有富余，糠菜半年粮的日子已经成为过去了。”
    朱玉荣和大女儿都是农业社员，她自己还是个生产队长，栽白薯、挑水、倒粪、扶犁、点种、插架，样样都会。她们娘儿俩，1956年共计两千四百多个工分，实分各种粮食三千多斤，人民币二十三元多。今年到五月底已做了一千多分了。朱玉荣自己还养着一头肥猪。她满意地说：“我把猪喂的滚瓜园，杀掉一秤一百七十二斤，除了留下吃的还卖了五十多元”。朱玉荣从来不浪费一个钱，棉线自己纺，麻线自己搓，衣服鞋袜全靠母女二人缝补，从去年11月到今年2月，已做了大小鞋十四双，布袜两双，把十九件棉衣拆洗得干干净净。这样省吃俭用，每月有五元存在银行里。去年朱玉荣又把和别人合买的小车和毛驴投入了合作社。同时，在朱玉荣的影响下，全村二百八十多户的工属，有75％都参加了农业劳动，她还从矿区公家宿舍里动员了一户工属，回来参加了社的劳动。
    朱玉荣的丈夫杨年因为没有家庭负担，工作积极性特别高。不管刮风下雨从不脱班，从去年第二季度起到今年第一季度，季季被评为先进生产者。说到这里，朱玉荣兴奋地说：“我认为这不仅是杨年的光荣，也是我们全家的光荣，今后，我要帮助他保持这个光荣称号，帮助更多的工属搞好家务劳动”。
    爱人——助手
    陈梓北教授的“珠算速成简明教程”一书已经写好了，就是其中的图式还没绘好。像逝去的几百个白天和夜晚一样，现在，他还伏在案上苦思苦想。他徒手绘着一个一个的算盘子，总绘不怎么圆，弯弯曲曲的，大小不一。他再一次把自己刻的和请人刻的图样拿来试印，结果，还是失望：线的粗细不一，有的地方太浓，有的又不显，非常难看。怎么办呢？
    “你歇歇吧。”他的爱人孙淑芳，把一杯快冷透了的开水倒在痰盂里，给他另倒了一杯滚的搁在书桌上，貌似埋怨，其实是关心地说，“老坐着，不走动，身体还要不要啊！”
    说着，她坐在床边补衣服去了。他没作回答。
    孙淑芳跟他结婚，已经三十多年，夫妻头发都斑白了。三十多年来，他们之间，从没闹过架。在生活上，她无微不至地关怀他；在工作上，她也是他的一个助手。她常常向亲友说：“我的爱人虽然是大学教授，但还像用功的学生一样，一下课回家，不是钻书本，就是拿起小刀子、小钻子、刻刻这，钻钻那，有时连吃饭、睡觉都忘掉了。”所以，家里的事情，柴、米、油、盐也好，教育子女也好，她总是主动地把这副担子担着，免得他操心，影响了他的教学和科学研究。虽然，当她社会工作繁忙的时候，也曾有过这样的念头：“他要是帮帮我，买买菜，做些杂事，该多好啊！”为了不致影响他的工作，她从没说出口，自己努力把困难克服了。她唯一焦虑的，就是自己文化低，除了给他做些研究中的事务工作外，别的就爱莫能助了。但是，他做研究工作，无论做到多夜深，她总是陪着他，好像这样可以帮助他抵御那无声地向他袭来的冷热，疲惫和衰老似的。
    自从他参观农业社回来，时常跟孙淑芳说：农民弟兄记账、算账有困难，他要加速把“珠算速成简明教程”写好。最近，河南人民出版社的同志也来催过稿。图式绘不好，书还是出不了。他着急，她也着急。
    “用个什么东西才能解决绘图式的问题呢？”她边补着孩子们的破衣裳，边寻求着答案。由于一心二用，针时常刺痛她的手指。“用麦杆点行吗？”她想起小时用麦杆点圆圈玩的事来。
    “梓北，用麦杆筒来点算盘珠行不行呢？”她好像豁然开朗，赶忙把自己想到的办法告诉他。
    “找来试试。”
    她找了麦管来，剪齐了，他就忙着往墨水盒里蘸，忙着往纸上印。
    “好，很好！”他看见两个线条显明、匀均大小合适的圆圈，十分高兴，“这下可有办法啦！”
    屋子里弥漫着这一对老夫妻高兴的笑声。
    书出版后，他总是向给他祝贺的人说：“这是家里帮的忙。”
