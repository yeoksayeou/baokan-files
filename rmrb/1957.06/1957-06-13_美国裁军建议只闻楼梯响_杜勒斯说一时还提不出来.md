Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 12th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference on the 11th that the United States would not formally present its long-touted disarmament proposal for the time being. He said that the United States would continue to discuss this issue with its NATO allies. He pointed out that some "difficult problems" had been encountered in some of the discussions that had already taken place. The return of the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Subcommittee, Stassen, to the United States was to discuss this situation.

Dulles said that the United States wanted to consult with its European allies on whether the first-stage disarmament agreement should include the establishment of inspection zones in Europe. He said he did not know how long it would take to make decisions on these issues, and the United States would not formally propose its disarmament proposals until these issues were clarified.

At the press conference, Dulles reiterated his opposition to Britain's decision to relax trade restrictions on China, saying that the U.S. attitude was to insist on a difference between trade restrictions on the Soviet Union and on China. He expressed the hope that the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) would continue to make a certain degree of joint decision on the actual limits on the export of certain goods to China.

When a reporter mentioned that the Soviet Union had suggested resuming cultural exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union, Dulles said that he also favored resumption. In this regard, he mentioned that the United States advocates frequent mutual broadcasts.

　　美国裁军建议只闻楼梯响
　　杜勒斯说一时还提不出来
    新华社12日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯11日在记者招待会上表示，美国一时不会正式提出它宣扬已久的裁军建议。他说，美国还要继续同北大西洋公约组织盟国就这个问题进行讨论。他指出，在已经进行的某些讨论中遇到了一些“困难问题”，美国出席裁军小组委员会代表史塔生返回美国，就是要商量这种局势。
    杜勒斯说，美国要同欧洲盟国商量第一阶段裁军协议是否包括在欧洲建立视察区的问题等。他说，他不知道需要多少时间才会在这些问题上作出决定，而在这些问题明确以后美国才会正式提出它的裁军建议。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上再度表示反对英国放宽对中国贸易限制的决定，他说，美国的态度是坚持对苏联和对中国的贸易限制要有所差异。他表示希望巴黎统筹委员会能继续在对中国输出某些货物的实际限额上作出一定程度的共同决定。
    在记者提到苏联已经建议恢复美苏之间的文化交流时，杜勒斯说，他也赞成恢复。在这方面，他谈到美国主张经常相互广播。
