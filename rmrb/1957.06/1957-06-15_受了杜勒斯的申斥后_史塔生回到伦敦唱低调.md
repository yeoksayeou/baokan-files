Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 14th. London disarmament conference U.S. representative Stassen left New York on June 13th to go to London to participate in the disarmament talks scheduled to resume today. Before his departure, he emphasized to reporters that the negotiations should proceed "slowly" and that "a few very important issues have not yet been resolved." He said he had received new "procedural" instructions from the State Department. According to American newspapers, Stassen received instructions that effectively delayed the disarmament talks. Dulles also appointed State Department career diplomat Holmes to the U.S. disarmament negotiation delegation as a "senior surveillance advisor" to Stassen. Sources say that Stassen, who had a somewhat positive attitude towards reaching a partial disarmament agreement, was "reprimanded" by Dulles after being summoned back to the United States. Dulles believed that his individual talks with Soviet representative Zorin were an "excess of authority."

　　受了杜勒斯的申斥后
　　史塔生回到伦敦唱低调
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息，伦敦裁军会议美国代表史塔生6月13日离开纽约前往伦敦参加定在今天重新开始的裁军谈判。他在行前对新闻记者们强调，谈判要“缓慢地”进行，“少数非常重要的问题还没有解决”。他说，他已经得到国务院新的“程序”指示。而据美国报纸透露，史塔生接到了实际上要拖延裁军谈判的指示。杜勒斯还委派了国务院职业外交家霍姆斯参加美国裁军谈判代表团，作为对史塔生的“高级监视顾问”。有消息说，对达成局部裁军协议抱某种积极态度的史塔生这次奉召返国后遭到杜勒斯的“申斥”，杜勒斯认为他同苏联代表佐林举行个别谈话是“越权”。
