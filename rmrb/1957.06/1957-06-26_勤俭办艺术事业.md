To run communes thriftily, to run factories thriftily, to run enterprises thriftily, to run…thriftily; these inspiring examples are reported in the newspapers every day. Then, can art endeavors also be run thriftily?

Some say that art troupes are different from factories and agricultural cooperatives; art endeavors are about spending money, and the higher the quality of art, the more money will be spent. Today is very different from the era of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. At that time, a few song and dance team members, playing a harmonica, pulling an erhu, doing a Yangko dance, jumping and hopping, could perform a play; now, if it's like that, it can hardly be considered art. Today's art must be standardized and modernized. In terms of stage scenery, costumes, and props, they must be realistic, presentable, and up to standard. For example, costumes should be high-grade wool, fans should be ivory, handkerchiefs should be silk, flower petals should be satin…; with these "foils," the art will be more beautiful and more captivating.

Some say, I understand the meaning of thrift very well; but my art troupe is different from other art troupes. I am engaged in experimentation and demonstration. Since we have to experiment and demonstrate, we have to create and research, so we have to give some conditions; first of all, the staffing should be broader, there should be more business backbones, and administrative management personnel should also be strengthened, and relevant units of the competent authority should be asked to "pick the best" to equip them; secondly, the funds supplied by the state should be more abundant, business management of enterprise cannot be highly demanded, number of performances cannot be required to be many, and the prepared budget cannot be "cut"; furthermore, the materials and equipment should be available from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, because any era and any background may have some "connection" with art; also, the basic construction square meters…. If these cannot be met, it is difficult to imagine producing something very good.

I am a person who does not understand art, but I like to watch plays. From some of the situations I have come into contact with, I also want to say a few words as an amateur.

The beauty of stage scenery, costumes, and props is also a component of art, and it should be placed in an appropriate position, but it is not the only one, but subordinate; this is because theatrical art infects and educates the audience through the actors' thoughts, emotions, and actions. To improve the quality of art, the first requirement is to improve the ideological and artistic nature of the works and the actors' performing skills; it is difficult to achieve this goal without working hard in this area. Doesn't the Kun Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" give us a good inspiration? Audiences go to the theater to watch plays and to appreciate art; using gorgeous stage scenery, costumes, and props may not replace the improvement of art quality and guarantee good artistic effects. On the contrary, using some substitutes will not reduce the quality of art or be blamed by the audience. In recent years, there have been cases where some art workers are very demanding on stage scenery, some productions are reworked time and time again, and some productions are even completely scrapped, saying that "doing badly is a process of improvement." As for spending thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan for costumes and props, they do not hesitate to do so; however, they often lack in-depth research on the works and performing skills, and often neglect diligent study and hard practice. In fact, if the frame is not good, gilding is also in vain. By the way, some theaters, in order to match the beauty of the stage scenery, even the curtains and the work clothes of the receptionists are made of fine wool. I don't know what relationship this has with art?

The manpower and financial resources of art endeavors should be guaranteed. The Party and the government have always been extremely concerned about and fully supportive of art endeavors, and therefore art endeavors are gradually developing and prospering; the operation and management of art endeavors are also gradually getting on track. However, some phenomena of greed, exaggeration, and extravagance have indeed emerged. For example, some art troupes and art workers excessively emphasize the particularity of art, emphasizing the specialization of their own units, and the staffing is getting bigger and bigger, and the institutions are becoming more and more bloated. As for the dissatisfaction with the competent authority for fighting for people and money, it is not entirely unique. Some actors in some art troupes have not been able to perform for several years and are bored, but they still want to increase personnel; some only emphasize the needs of their own units, regardless of the difficulties and possibilities of the locality and the grassroots; some have many personnel, but few plays can be performed; some play boxes are moldy, and the costumes are eaten by insects and rats, but they still want to make new costumes; some have enough guitar strings in stock for more than ten years, but they still want to apply for ordering them from abroad; some rarely consider the number of performances and the situation of income and expenditure, anyway, the state will "subsidize the difference." For example, the funds that some central art troupes need from the state every year are equivalent to the entire year's art funds of individual provinces and cities. The fine style of hard work and simplicity of the past is gradually diminishing in some art workers, while the extravagant style of showing off and extravagance is growing; this situation is not only very obvious in some central art troupes, but also in some provincial and municipal art troupes that are looking towards this aspect. Here, we cannot fail to notice that the vast number of folk professional art troupes across the country are ahead of the state-run art troupes in terms of thrift and simplicity. It is precisely this that they are more closely connected with the broad audience and are well received.

Art serves the people and encourages the people to strive for the construction of socialism. Overcoming extravagance and waste in artistic practice and saving funds for the country is precisely where art workers should set an example.

### 勤俭办艺术事业

　　勤俭办艺术事业
　　缪群
    勤俭办社，勤俭办工厂，勤俭办企业，勤俭办……；这些令人振奋的事例，报上每天都有见载。那末，艺术事业也可不可以勤俭地办呢？
    有人说，艺术团体与工厂、农业社不同，艺术事业就是花钱的，艺术质量愈高花钱就会愈多。今天与抗日、解放战争的时代大不相同了，那个时候，有几个歌舞队员，吹个口琴，拉个二胡，扭个秧歌，跳跳蹦蹦，就能演起戏来了；现在如果这样的话，可就很难算得上是艺术了。现在的艺术要正规化、现代化，在舞台布景、服装、道具方面，必须是真实像样、合乎标准。比方说，服装该是高级的毛呢料，扇子是象牙的，手帕是丝绸的，花瓣是缎子的……；有了这些个“烘托”，就会使艺术更加美艳，更能引人入胜。
    有人说，我是很理解勤俭的意义的；但我这个艺术团体和其他的艺术团体有所不同，我是搞实验的，也是示范性质的。既要实验、示范，就得要创造、研究，那就要给些条件；首先，人员编制要宽一些，业务骨干要多，行政管理人员也要加强，要请主管机关的有关单位“拔尖”来配齐；其次，国家供给的经费要充裕一些，企业化的经营管理不能要求高，演出的场次不能要求多，编造的预算不能“砍”；再者，资料器材，应该是中外古今，应有尽有，因为任何时代任何背景都可能与艺术有些“瓜葛”；还有，基本建设平方米……。倘使这些不能满足，要想搞出个很好的东西来是很难设想的。
    我是个不懂艺术的人，但我喜欢看戏，从我接触到的一些情况，也想说几句门外汉的话。
    舞台的布景、服装、道具的美，也是艺术的一个组成部分，应该把它放在适当的位置，但不是唯一的，而是从属的；这因为，戏剧艺术是通过演员的思想、情感和动作来感染和教育观众的，要提高艺术的质量，首先就要求提高作品的思想性、艺术性和演员的表演技巧；这方面不下工夫，是很难达目的的。昆剧“十五贯”不是给我们很好的启发吗？观众到剧场去为的是看戏，为的是欣赏艺术；用富丽豪华的布景、服装、道具，未必能代替艺术质量的提高和保证艺术效果的良好，相反的，利用一些代用品，也不致降低艺术质量和受到观众的责备。近年来，确实有这样的情况，有些艺术工作者，对舞台布景非常苛求，有些演出制作一次又一次的返工，有些演出制作甚至全部报废，名之曰“作坏了是提高的过程”，至于为服装、道具要花几千甚至几万元也是在所不惜的；而对作品及表演的技巧方面往往是缺乏深刻钻研，且常忽略勤学苦练。其实，骨架不好，贴金也是徒劳的。捎带说一句，有些剧场，为了配合舞台布景的美，连窗帘及招待员的工作服都是毛呢料精制的，不知这同艺术有什么关系？
    艺术事业的人力、财力应该有所保证，党和政府对艺术事业从来就是极其关怀和全力支持的，因而艺术事业正在逐步发展和繁荣；艺术事业的经营管理也正在逐步走上轨道。但是，也确实出现了一些贪多、贪大、浮夸、奢侈的现象。例如，有些艺术团体和艺术工作者，过分的强调艺术特殊性，强调本单位的特殊化，编制越滚越大，机构越来越臃肿，至于为争人争钱对主管机关不满的事也不是绝无仅有的事。有些艺术团体的演员，几年演不上戏，闷得发慌，但还要增加人员；有的只强调本单位的需要，不顾地方和基层的困难及可能；有的人员虽多，能演的戏却很少；有的戏箱发霉，戏装被虫咬鼠啃，还要新制戏装；有的库存琴弦儿够用十几年，还要申请向国外订购；有的对演出场次和收支盈亏的情况如何，很少考虑，反正有国家来“差额补助”。例如，有些中央艺术团体每年要国家供给的经费，相当于个别省市的全年的艺术经费。过去那种艰苦朴素的优良风气，在某些艺术工作者身上正逐步减退，而讲排场、耍阔气的铺张风气，正在滋长；这种情况，不但在中央某些艺术团体中很明显，而且在某些省市的艺术团体也正朝这方面看齐。这里，我们不能不注意到，全国广大的民间职业艺术团体，在勤俭和朴素方面，是走在国营艺术团体的前面，正是这，他们更密切的联系了广大的观众并且受到好评。
    艺术是服务人民的，鼓舞人民为建设社会主义而奋斗。克服艺术实践中的铺张浪费，为国家节约资金，正是艺术工作者应该以身作则的地方。
