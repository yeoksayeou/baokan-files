    We Firmly Take the Socialist Road
　　Wu Han, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League

    I was sick for a period and am currently recuperating in another place. During my recuperation, I cannot do other things, so I read the newspaper every day. Reading the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people remarks of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Chu Anping, I became increasingly angry and indignant. I really could not tolerate it, so I stopped recuperating and returned to Beijing to argue.

    What road is the China Democratic League taking? Where do the leaders of the China Democratic League want to lead the League? Zhang Bojun wants to establish a political design institute, Luo Longji wants to establish a rehabilitation committee outside the Party and government organizations, and Chu Anping attacks the Party as the ultimate source of all sectarianism. These arguments that confuse right and wrong and violate the Constitution, the CPPCC Charter, and the League Charter must be debated and exposed!

    The working target of the China Democratic League is intellectuals. Over the past eight years, intellectuals have participated in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and have become a vital force in socialist construction by uniting with workers and peasants. Now, suddenly, a small handful of right-wing ambitious elements have seized the opportunity of the Party's rectification movement, claiming to represent us, flaunting the banner of intellectuals, saying they are determined to take the socialist road, but walking the capitalist road in reality. This must be debated and exposed!

    On the one hand, I feel angry about the fallacies of the leaders of the China Democratic League and some right-wing elements. At the same time, I also deeply feel that I have not managed the work of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League very much in the past few years, rarely attended the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the League, and have a narrow and infrequent contact with intellectuals. I have not done well what I should have done, and I have not said all that I should have said. As one of the main persons in charge of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the League, I have not done the work I should have done.

    I must state my position and draw a clear line with this small group of people. We must argue, argue until the truth comes out, until things are clear, and not allow anyone to use the position of the China Democratic League to carry out anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people activities.

    We have only one road, the socialist road! Intellectuals embark on the socialist road and become socialist intellectuals through their own understanding, personal experience, and gradual progress. We all come from the old society. The schools run in the old era, whether in terms of their purpose, methods, content, or system, all served the interests of the bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord class. We who received such education could not but enter the new society and the new era with the heavy baggage of the landlord class and bourgeois ideology. After eight years of learning and work practice, after eight years of economic recovery and construction, after a series of great movements such as land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, we have been walking and discarding baggage all the way. The longer we walk, the more baggage we discard, and the greater the proportion of socialism in our ideology, and the smaller the proportion of feudalism and the bourgeoisie.

    Think about our situation in the university before liberation. What kind of life did most of us live at that time? Prices and "legal tender" were racing against "gold yuan coupons." Zhu Ziqing died of poverty and starvation. We once participated in the anti-hunger movement. Some of us were blacklisted and threatened by secret agents. Wen Yiduo was killed by an American silent pistol. We once participated in the anti-persecution movement. The Shen Chong case occurred in Beijing, and we also participated in the anti-violence movement. Our lives were precarious, and our lives were not guaranteed. Can we imagine that without the Communist Party, without the national liberation of 1949, wouldn't we ourselves become Zhu Ziqing and Wen Yiduo? Wouldn't our children become Shen Chong?

    We suffered from double oppression, politically and economically. We were liberated, and we joyfully entered the new society. We accepted the leadership of the Party and accepted socialism with our own understanding and experience.

    Which of the national construction works in the past eight years does not make us happy, ecstatic! In 1949, there were 24 million primary school students nationwide, and this year there are 63 million; 1.26 million middle school students, and this year there are 5.97 million; 117,000 university students, and this year there are more than 400,000.

    The output of steel was 158,000 tons in 1949, and this year it will be more than 4 million tons.

    In the past few years, 6,300 kilometers of new railways have been built.

    There are also the Jingjiang flood diversion, the Huai River harnessing project, the Yangtze River Bridge, the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and more than 200 large-scale industrial construction projects. Which of these could have been realized in the past era?

    We not only support the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism with our own understanding and experience, but as Chinese people, we also feel proud, because these unprecedented great achievements all contain the labor and contribution of our intellectuals, and we have a share of the credit in them; at the same time, we also feel a great responsibility, because in such a leap forward, many shortcomings have emerged, and we also have a share of the responsibility for these shortcomings.

    However, just when we are about to affirm our achievements, correct our shortcomings, and build our own country better and more effectively, just when we are helping the Party rectify its work with a positive, serious, and conscientious attitude, and giving opinions to the Party, right-wing ambitious elements take the opportunity to shout and clamor, saying that "the shortcomings are the main aspect of the work in the past eight years," "completely dark," "completely useless," and so on. These people not only monopolize the opinions of workers, peasants, and young people, saying that they are dissatisfied with the Party and socialism; they also monopolize the opinions of our middle-aged and elderly intellectuals, insisting on representing us. They want to transform the Party with their own intentions and bourgeois face, overthrow the leadership of the Party, and use capitalist false democracy to lead and rule the people. We are advancing happily on the socialist road, but they insist on pulling us onto another road—the capitalist road.

    Of course, it can be affirmed that through these eight years of learning and practice, the vast majority of our intellectuals have recognized the road they should take and will never follow them on that road, because we have already distinguished what that road means for the future.

    However, the problem is serious. As long as there are still feudal and bourgeois remnants in the ideological consciousness of our intellectuals, this kind of argument will still have a market; a small number of people have vague understanding and are easily deceived. We cannot be paralyzed and careless, thinking that this fallacy is not worth refuting, but must refute it and must argue.

    We cannot tolerate and forgive these people without principle. To tolerate and forgive right-wing ambitious elements, to allow those reactionary remarks to run rampant without refuting them is to abandon responsibility for the just cause of the people, so we must stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and draw a clear line. This is a class struggle on the political and ideological front, and we must expose the conspiracy of the right-wing ambitious elements, expose their double-dealing tactics, and expose their ugly faces to the people of the whole country! We must resolutely support the leadership of the Party, resolutely support socialism, and defend the great construction achievements of the past eight years.

    Members of the China Democratic League have already made and are making demands to the Central Committee of the League, demanding that the Central Committee state its position, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, correct its leadership position, and lead all members of the League, together with intellectuals across the country and the people of the whole country, to resolutely support the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road. At the same time, we must better study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen political and ideological work, and earnestly help League members and the intellectuals with whom we are connected, and strive to become socialist intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialist construction.

    This request of the vast number of League members is completely legitimate. We firmly take the socialist road!

    我们坚决走社会主义的道路
　　民盟中央常务委员、民盟北京市委主任委员　吴晗
    病了一个时期，正在外地休养，休养中不能作别的事，天天读报，读到章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平的反党反社会主义反人民的言论，愈读愈生气、愤怒。实在不能容忍，只好不休养了，回到北京来争。
    中国民主同盟走的是什么道路？民盟的领导人要领导民盟走到那里去？章伯钧要搞政治上的设计院，罗隆基要搞党、政机构以外的平反委员会，储安平攻击党是一切宗派主义的最终根源。这些混淆是非，违反宪法，政协章程和盟章规定的论调，非争不可，非揭穿不可！
    中国民主同盟的工作对象是知识分子。知识分子八年来参加了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，和工人、农民结合在一起，是社会主义建设的一支有生力量。现在，忽然有一小撮右派野心分子，钻党的整风运动的空子，说是代表我们，打着知识分子的招牌，嘴上说坚决走社会主义的道路，脚底却朝资本主义的道路走，非争不可！非揭穿不可！
    我一方面对民盟领导人和一些右派分子的谬论感到愤怒，同时，也深切感到自己几年来对民盟市委的工作管得不多，民盟中央的常委会很少参加，和知识分子的接触、联系面很窄，而且不经常。该做的事没有很好做，该说的话没有全说，作为北京民盟市委的主要负责人之一，我没有做好应做的工作。
    必须表明立场，和这一小撮人划清界限。要争，要争到水落石出，要争到事理明白，不能容许任何人利用民盟的地位进行反党反社会主义反人民的活动。
    我们的道路只有一条，社会主义的道路！知识分子走上社会主义的道路，成为社会主义知识分子，是通过自己的认识，亲身的经历，逐步走到的。我们都从旧社会来，旧时代所办的学校，无论是办学目的，方法，内容，制度都是为了资产阶级和封建地主阶级的利益服务的，受了这样教育的我们不可能不带着地主阶级、资产阶级思想意识的沉重包袱走进新社会新时代。经过了八年来的学习和工作实践，经过了八年来的经济恢复和建设工作，经过土地改革、三反、五反、抗美援朝、镇反、肃反一系列伟大的运动，一路走，一路丢包袱，路走得越长，包袱也丢得越多，思想意识中的社会主义的比重越来越大，封建的、资产阶级的比重越来越小了。
    想想解放前我们在大学里的情况吧，那时候我们中间大多数人过的是什么日子？物价和“法币”
  “金元券”赛跑，朱自清就是穷饿而死的，我们曾经参加过反饥饿运动。我们中间还有一部分人上了黑名单，被特务跟踪威胁，闻一多就是被美国无声手枪杀死的，我们曾经参加过反迫害运动。沈崇案就发生在北京，我们也参加过抗暴运动。我们的生活朝不谋夕，我们的生命朝不保夕。不能够设想，没有共产党，没有1949年的全国解放，我们自己不成为朱自清，闻一多？我们的儿女不成为沈崇？
    我们身受着政治、经济的双重压迫，得到解放，我们欢欣鼓舞地进入了新社会。我们以自己的认识和经历接受了党的领导，接受了社会主义。
    八年来的国家建设工作，那一项不使我们高兴，狂喜！1949年全国小学生二千四百万人，今年是六千三百万人；中学生一百二十六万人，今年是五百九十七万人；大学生十一万七千人，今年是四十多万人。
    钢的产量，1949年是十五万八千吨，今年将为四百多万吨。
    铁路这几年就新建了六千三百公里。
    还有荆江分洪、治淮工程、长江大桥、鞍钢、武钢、包钢的建设，二百多项大工业的建设工程等等，哪一项是过去时代所曾经所能够实现的？
    我们不但以自己的认识、经历，拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义，作为一个中国人，我们还感到骄傲，因为这些史无前例的伟大成就，都有我们知识分子的劳力、贡献，有我们的一份成绩在里面；同时也感到责任重大，因为在这样飞跃的进展中，出现了不少缺点，这些缺点，我们也有一份责任。
    但是，正当我们要肯定自己的成绩，纠正自己的缺点，为了更好地更有效地建设我们自己的国家的时候，正当我们以积极的严肃的认真的态度帮助党整风，对党提意见的时候，右派野心分子就乘机乱叫乱嚷，说什么“八年来的工作，缺点是主要的”，“漆黑一团”，“全无是处”等等。这些人不但包办了工人、农民和青年的意见，说他们对党不满，对社会主义不满；还包办了我们中年和老年知识分子的意见，硬要代表我们说话。他们要以自己的意图，资产阶级的面貌来改造党，推翻党的领导，用资本主义的假民主来领导、统治人民。我们正在兴高采烈地在社会主义道路上行进，而他们却硬要拉我们走上另一条道路——资本主义的道路。
    当然可以肯定，通过这八年的学习和实践，我们绝大多数知识分子已经认清了自己应该走的道路，决不会跟他们去走那条路，因为他们那条路意味着什么前途，我们已经分辨得出来了。
    但是，问题是严重的，只要我们知识分子的思想意识中还有封建的、资产阶级的残余，这种论调就还会有市场；少数人认识模糊不清，便容易上当。我们不能麻痹大意，以为这种谬论不值一驳，而是必驳，必须争。
    我们不能无原则地对这些人宽容、原谅，对右派野心分子宽容、原谅，听任那些反动言论泛滥而不加以驳，就是对人民的正义事业放弃责任，因而必须站稳立场，明辨是非，划清界限。这是一场政治思想战线上的阶级斗争，我们必须拆穿右派野心分子的阴谋，揭露他们的两面派手法，把他们的丑恶面貌暴露在全国人民的面前！我们要坚决拥护党的领导，坚决拥护社会主义，保卫八年来伟大的建设成果。
    民盟盟员已经和正在向民盟中央提出要求，要求中央表明立场，明辨是非，分清敌我，端正领导立场，领导全体盟员，和全国知识分子一道全国人民一道，坚决拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义的道路。同时，我们必须更好地学习马列主义，加强政治思想工作，认真帮助盟员和所联系的知识分子，争取成为全心全意为社会主义建设服务的社会主义知识分子。
    广大盟员的这种要求是完全正当的。我们坚决走社会主义的道路！
