    The Clock on the Jianghai Customs House
    You, the clock on the Jianghai Customs House, towering into the clouds; are you welcoming the surging river? Or are you gazing at the tide coming from beyond ten thousand miles away?…
    You work so silently and persistently, and when the time comes, you emit a bronze bell-like sound. You strike the world with your heavy hammer, striking our hearts. Loudly calling out to us: Welcome the new time…
    You do not know fatigue. Therefore, you turn day and night. You never retreat. Therefore, you turn forward day and night. Thus, you use your spear-like clock hand, that steel needle more than a foot long, to move the sun, to move the entire earth. Stirring our lives, stirring the years of hundreds of millions of people. Let us leave new colors in this new moment…
                  ——Written on the Bund in Shanghai
          Laying Rails
    The rail-laying team is laying steel rails on the roadbed. Leading the railway forward!
    Pass them up quickly, one after another, we are coming with steel, we are laying rails, we are bringing the train of life. With every step we take forward, the hustle and bustle of life advances! The prosperity of life advances! The joy of life also advances!
    Pass them up quickly! One after another! When our steel rails are laid here, even the earth will tremble. We awaken everything that is sleeping, we move everything that is still, we make everything change…
    Pass them up quickly! One after another! We are the steel vanguards! We want to lay steel rails all over our land.
            ——Written for the Third Section Rail-Laying Team
          Steel Smelting Furnace
    The steel smelting furnace is about to tap steel. The workers opened the furnace door, emitting ten thousand rays of red light, as if millions of suns were melted in the molten steel, rushing out from inside…
    Steel smelting furnace, you are the heart of our steel workers. The furnace door is open, and the furnace door in our hearts is also open. Our millions of hopes, our best ideals, are like this churning molten steel, draped in dazzling red light, spewing fireworks, rushing out from the bottom of our hearts, heading towards the vast and boundless life…
    We will use this pure steel from the bottom of our hearts, this steel that has been tempered thousands of times, to create an immortal new world…
                ——Written at the Third Steel Plant
      Green Parcels
    Green parcels, how many people love you, and how many people miss you. You, parcels filled with everything in the world, you are so full, and so heavy…
    You carry pure friendship and mutual warmth, coming and going among us.
    You carry steadfast love and deep longing, coming and going among us.
    You carry the news of a person's birth, the victory of millions of people's labor, coming and going among us. You are so profound, and yet so joyful…
    But sometimes you are so unexpected, you bring news of pain and difficulty to torment us. You bring disease and separation, even death, to scare us. But we have accepted all your trials…
    Parcel! You know life just like us. Like us, you can contain all of life in your heart…
                    ——Dedicated to the Postmen
      Going for a Walk Over There
    After dinner, we walk on the beach by the sea. The child shouts to me, he wants to go over there…
    What is over there? Over there is the place where the sea and the sky meet. Over there is a patch of red light, over there is the setting sun, and the melting waves.
    Are we going to see the sun resting? Are we going to see where this ball of inextinguishable fire has fallen into the sea, to salvage it?
    The child smiles and says, I want to see where the sun sleeps? When will it get up tomorrow… Also want to ask it which flowered dress it likes to wear?…
          Laundry Team
    Beside the spring river, the river water has thawed. Our cooperative has launched a sanitation campaign…
    Seven or eight field stoves have been set up by the river. Seven or eight large iron pots have been set up. Seven or eight large fires have been lit. A large group of people have come, a large pile of bundles…
    We can only spare half a day. Let's all get to work quickly. Those who fetch water fetch water, those who stoke the fire stoke the fire, quickly throw the dirty clothes and dirty quilts into the water…
    How many people are washing, scrubbing! Everyone rolls up their trouser legs, bares their arms, and some people even pick up the washing bat, that's not bad! Don't say we are clumsy, even the darkest things are washed white, and the grease is splashed away along with the sewage…
    That's how we are healthy and happy!
              ——At the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative
          Water Wheel
    White clouds stick to the blue sky, and the spring sun scatters countless golden lights on the small river. I saw thatched huts by the river, screaming creakingly…
    I walked over and saw a child shouting at a large water buffalo, the wooden wheel turning non-stop, the water wheel shouting at the small river…
    The water wheel shouted: Little river, little river, you should join the cooperative too, come up and visit, visit…
    The water wheel shouted: Look, this large field belongs to our cooperative, come up quickly! We want to let you, the green and cool river water, run all over this field…
    The water wheel shouted: All these thatched huts, all these cows, are newly added to our cooperative, we are all drawing water for the cooperative… Come up quickly…
    The river heard the water wheel calling it, and it followed the water wheel and rushed up with a whoosh…

            Interviewing
    No job requires such speed and accuracy…
    No job is so broad, it almost encompasses all of life…
    The people's reporter, swimming in the ocean of the people. Prospecting for the people's treasures everywhere…
    Some say you are the people's eyes, the people's ears, but you must also contain the hearts of millions of people, so that you can emit the voices of millions of people.
    Wherever there are people, you should be there. Wherever there is labor and creation, you should be there.
    Countless ideal seeds in life are waiting for you to sow the news of germination…
                ——Dedicated to the Hardworking Journalists

    早霞短笛
    柯蓝
    江海关上的大钟
    你，江海关上的大钟，高耸入云；你是要迎接滚滚而来的江水？还是要眺望从万里以外而来的海潮？……
    你是这样长久地沉默地工作，而你到一定的时候，却又发出了铜钟般的响声。用你那沉重的钟锤敲打着世界，敲打着我们的心。大声向我们呼号：迎接新的时间吧……
    你是不知道疲倦的。因此你日夜不停地转动。你是从来不后退的。因此，你日夜不停地向前转动。于是，你用你那长枪般的时钟，那一丈多长的钢针哟，拨动着太阳，拨动着整个地球。拨动着我们的生活，拨弄着亿万人的年华。让我们在这新的时刻里，留下新的色彩……
                  ——写于上海外滩
          铺　轨
    铺轨队在路基上铺着钢轨。把铁路往前面引去！
    快传上来，一根紧接一根，我们是带着钢铁来了，是铺着路轨来了，是带着生活的列车来了。我们前进一步，生活的喧闹就前进一步！生活的繁盛就前进一步！生活的欢乐也前进一步！
    快传上来！一根紧接一根！我们的钢轨一铺在这里，连大地都要震动。我们把一切沉睡的吵醒了，我们把一切静止的移动了，我们使一切都起变化了……
    快传上来！一根紧接一根！我们是钢铁的尖兵！我们要把钢轨铺遍我们所有的土地。
            ——写给第三工段铺轨队
          熔钢炉
    熔钢炉要出钢了。工人们打开了炉门，放射出万道红光，仿佛千万个太阳熔化在钢水里，从里面冲射出来了……
    熔钢炉，你就是我们钢铁工人的心。炉门打开了，我们心上的炉门也打开了。我们千万个希望，最好的理想，就像这翻腾的钢水，披着刺眼的红光，喷射着烟火，从心底冲射出来了，奔向那广阔无边的生活……
    我们要用这心底的纯真的钢水，这经过千锤百炼的钢水，去创造一个万古不朽的新世界……
                ——写于第三钢铁厂
      绿色的邮包
    绿色的邮包，多少人爱你，又有多少人想念你。你，装满着世界一切的邮包呵，你是如此充实，而又如此沉重……
    你带着纯真的友情和相互的温暖，在我们之中来往。
    你带着坚贞的爱情和深沉的想念，在我们之中来往。
    你带着一个人的出生，千万人劳动的胜利消息，在我们之中来往。你是如此的深沉，而又欢乐……
    可是你有时却又如此意外，你带着痛苦和困难的消息来折磨我们。你带着疾病和离别，甚至死亡来吓唬我们。但是我们都接受了你的一切考验……
    邮包！你跟我们一样是知道生活的。你跟我们一样，都能够把所有的生活，包藏在自己的心底……
                    ——献给邮递员
      到那边去散步
    吃过晚饭，我们在海边沙滩上散步。小孩对着我喊，他要到那边去……
    那边是什么地方？那边是海和天相接的地方。那边有一片红光，那边有快落的太阳，和那熔化的波浪。
    是去看看要休息的太阳吗？是去看看这一团不灭的红火，掉进了大海的什么地方，要把它打捞起来吗？
    小孩笑着说，我要去看看太阳睡在什么地方？明天它什么时候起床……再想问问它喜欢穿哪一件花衣裳？……
          洗衣队
    春天的小河边，河水已经解冻。我们的合作社，来了一个卫生运动……
    小河边架了七、八个野灶。支起了七、八口大铁锅。烧起了七、八堆大火。可来了一大堆人，一大堆包裹……
    我们只能抽出半天的时间。大家快动手吧。提水的提水，烧火的烧火，快把穿脏的衣服，用脏的被子，统统丢进水里……
    多少人洗的洗，搓的搓！大家卷起裤管，赤着胳膊，还有人拿起了棒棰，那可不错！别说我们粗手粗脚，再黑的也洗白了，油垢也连同污水泼走了。……
    我们就是这样健康、快乐！
              ——于红星农业合作社
          水　车
    白云贴在青天上，春天的太阳在小河上撒出了无数的金光。我看见河岸上，一座一座的茅棚，在吱吱呀呀地叫喊……
    我走过去一看，一个小孩在?喝着一条大水牛，木轮在不停地转动，水车在对着小河叫喊……
    水车在喊：小河，小河，你也入社吧，你也上来参观，参观吧……
    水车在喊：看，这一大片田野都是我们社里的，你快上来吧！我们要让你，又青又凉的河水，在这田野上跑遍……
    水车在喊：这所有的茅棚，所有的牛，都是我们社里新添的，我们都是为社里车水……你快上来吧……
    河水听见水车喊它，它就跟着水车呼呼地跑上来了……
            ——写于西郊第二农业社
            采　访
    没有一件工作，要这样快，还要准确……
    没有一件工作，是这样的广阔，它几乎包括着全部生活。……
    人民的记者，游泳在人民的海洋。到处勘采人民的财宝……
    有人说，你是人民的眼睛，人民的耳朵，但你还要包藏着千万人的心，你才能发出千万人的声音。
    有人民的地方，就应该有你。有劳动和创造的地方，就应该有你。
    生活中无数理想的种子，都等待你去播种那发芽的消息……
                ——献给辛勤的记者
