Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Teachers and staff from six universities and colleges in the capital are generally satisfied with the preliminary self-examination reports from the responsible comrades of the Party committees of their respective schools. They expressed their intention to draw clear ideological lines, continue to actively offer opinions, and help the Party to carry out the rectification movement well.

Many professors and doctors at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences believe that the preliminary self-examination report of Zhang Zhiqiang, the Party Secretary of the Academy, is modest, sincere, and realistic, and that it has resolved some problems. Professor Lin Qiaozhi believes that this preliminary review is very good. She said that it is impossible to solve all problems at once, and many major problems need to be repeatedly studied and discussed before they can be resolved. Professor Zhou Huakang said: Our Academy's Party organization lacks experience in leading medical and teaching institutions, coupled with the shortcomings of some leading cadres themselves, which have caused some problems in the work. This is an objective reality. However, some people's criticisms are not based on facts, exaggerating shortcomings, and completely negating past work, which is also not good. He hopes that in the future, both those who offer opinions and those who accept criticism will be more sincere. Criticisms and self-examinations that do not respect facts cannot truly solve problems. Zhou Huakang finally said: Our Academy still has many problems, such as the lack of clear direction and tasks, the relationship between comprehensiveness and external collaboration, and the appropriate arrangement of various types of personnel, all of which need further research and resolution.

Professor Dong Shuping, Deputy Director of the Department of Power Machinery at Tsinghua University, and Professor Li Youshan, Director of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing, both agree with the estimates and analysis of the shortcomings in the school's teaching in Jiang Nanxiang's self-examination report. Professor Dong Shuping said that this shows that the school Party committee sincerely accepts the problems revealed by all parties and is determined and confident to correct the shortcomings in its work. Professor Li Youshan said that Tsinghua University's teaching reform has more gains than shortcomings. Although advantages may not be mentioned during the rectification, shortcomings cannot be exaggerated to the point of negating the teaching reform. Otherwise, it will become revisionism replacing dogmatism. Professor Dong Shuping was particularly satisfied with the part of Jiang Nanxiang's report on how to continue to carry out the rectification movement in the future. He said that the rectification is mainly to expose subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism, and to improve work. Criticizing dogmatism is to better grasp Marxism-Leninism, not to take the road of revisionism. The school Party committee's analysis of this issue is very important, and the Party committee's timely ideological leadership can make the rectification movement develop more healthily. Professor Li Youshan also talked about the issue of refuting anti-socialist remarks in the newspapers. He said that it is necessary to refute anti-socialist remarks so that the shortcomings in the work revealed in the rectification can be clearer, more thorough, and more appropriate, so that the Party can prescribe the right medicine for these shortcomings. If not refuted, it will confuse the real shortcomings in the work with anti-socialist remarks.

Teachers and students of the Beijing Railway Institute held seminars today by department, class, and teaching and research office to discuss yesterday's report by Wang Xiaoci, the secretary of the college party committee. Most people expressed satisfaction with the party committee's report, believing that it was sincere, pragmatic, and dealt with issues fairly. In particular, the decision of party member cadres to return some of their welfare benefits and cancel the priority certificates they had previously received to take care of the lives of senior intellectuals was praised by non-party members. Wang Xicheng, a 64-year-old professor and member of the China Democratic League, said that he was convinced by the party committee's report, and that the leadership's courage to admit shortcomings further enhanced the party's prestige. Teacher Ma Yuxun said to another party member teacher that the party committee had widely listened to the opinions of non-party members in this stage, and now he realized that it was the right thing to do, and that the leadership of the party central committee was correct. Some professors believed that many well-intentioned criticisms were made during the previous period of great airing and blooming, but some erroneous arguments were also revealed. He hoped to further promote great airing and great debate, and to distinguish right from wrong in the debate. The China Democratic League branch of this college also held a branch meeting today. League member teachers spoke enthusiastically to refute the anti-socialist remarks of Zhang Bojun and others, and to draw a clear ideological line to more sincerely help the Communist Party rectify its work. Niu Zequan, Director of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Teaching and Research Section of the Transportation Department and a member of the China Democratic League, said that the enthusiastic applause received by Party Secretary Wang Xiaoci's report this time was something that had not been seen in the past one or two years, and it enhanced the Party's prestige.

Professor Chen Bochuan of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Agricultural Mechanization Institute said: I am very satisfied with Comrade Sun Jinglu's self-examination report. Although this report is not very detailed, it shows the leadership's determination to rectify. Zhu Xinyuan, who is engaged in teaching and research, said: This report dispelled many of my misunderstandings about the party committee. Originally, I thought that the party committee was afraid of pain and had no determination to correct its shortcomings. After listening to the report, I felt that the party committee's attitude was very sincere and its determination was very strong. The most obvious thing is that seven party committee members voluntarily reduced their salaries.

After listening to the Party committee's self-examination report on rectification, non-Party professors and staff of the Beijing Petroleum Institute generally believed that it was realistic and showed the Party organization's determination to rectify. Wu Chi, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs, believes that the Party Committee Secretary's self-criticism demonstrates the spirit of rectifying while correcting. He made some suggestions on how to conduct rectification in the future. He said that some fundamental issues, such as the school system, cannot be resolved all at once and should be organized for special research during the rectification. In the future, it should not only be non-Party members who voice their opinions unilaterally, but Party members and leading cadres should also openly and honestly express their different views, in order to achieve true "contention."

Wu Chi also mentioned that the school leaders have not paid enough attention to the preparation for teaching in the next semester recently. He hopes that the school leaders will truly achieve two things without error in the rectification work in the future. Wang Peiqing, Deputy Section Chief of the Academic Affairs Section who has worked in academic affairs for eighteen years, said that the Party Committee's self-examination report proved that the Party organization can face up to its mistakes and correct them. He said that this is not only due to the reasonable adjustment of his work, but more importantly, the Party's leadership is very sincere and modest. In this way, although many sharp opinions have been raised in the rectification, the masses and the Party are closer together.

　　整风使党和群众的团结更巩固了
　　首都高等学校师生员工热烈欢迎党委的初步检查
    新华社14日讯　首都六个高等学校的师生员工，对各该校党委负责人的初步检查报告普遍感到满意。他们表示要划清思想界限，继续积极提意见，帮助党把整风运动搞好。
    中国协和医学院许多教授和医生对这个学院党委书记张之强的检查报告的初步反映是，虚心诚恳，实事求是，解决了一些问题。林巧稚教授认为这次初步检讨是很好的，她说，当然要求一下子解决所有的问题是不可能的，有许多重大问题需要反复研究、讨论才能够解决。周华康教授说：我们学院的党组织对领导医疗教学机构缺乏经验，加上某些领导干部本身的缺点，使工作出了一些问题。这是客观存在。但是有些人批评不实事求是，把缺点夸大，全盘否定过去的工作，这也是不好的。他希望今后无论是提意见的或是接受批评的人，态度都要诚恳一些，不尊重事实的批评和检讨都不能真正的解决问题。周华康最后说：我们这个学院的问题还很多，如方针任务不明确、综合性与对外协作的关系以及各类人员的适当安排等问题，都需要进一步的研究解决。
    清华大学动力机械系副主任董树屏教授、机械制造系主任李酉山教授都同意蒋南翔检查报告中关于学校教学方面缺点的估计和分析。董树屏教授说，这表现了学校党委是诚恳地接受了各方面揭发的问题的，是有决心有信心改正工作中缺点的。李酉山教授说，清华大学的教学改革还是收获多于缺点，在整风中虽然可以不说优点，但是不能把缺点夸大了，因而否定了教学改革。不然就变成以修正主义来代替教条主义了。董树屏教授特别对蒋南翔报告中关于今后如何继续开展整风运动的部分感到满意。他说，整风主要是为了揭发主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，改进工作，批判教条主义是为了更好地掌握马列主义，而不是要走修正主义道路。学校党委对这个问题的分析很要紧，党委及时作这样的思想领导，就可以使整风运动更健康地发展。李酉山教授还谈到了报上反驳反社会主义言论的问题。他说，对反社会主义言论的批驳是必要的，这样就能使整风中所揭发的工作缺点更明确，更透彻，能够恰如其分，使党对这些缺点能够对症下药。如果不批驳的话，就会使工作中的真正缺点和反社会主义言论混淆起来。
    北京铁道学院师生今天按系、班和教研室分别举行座谈会，座谈昨天学院党委书记王孝慈的报告，大部分人对党委的报告表示满意，认为态度诚恳，实事求是，处理问题很公正，尤其是党员干部要退还一部分福利费和取消以前领到的照顾高级知识分子生活的优先证，更受到非党人士的称赞。六十四岁的老教授、民盟盟员汪禧诚说，听了党委的报告，令人心服，领导上勇于承认缺点，更提高了党的威信。教师马毓珣对另一个党员教师说，党委在这一阶段广泛听取党外人士的意见，现在看起来才知道是对的，党中央的领导是正确的。有的教授认为前一段时期大放大鸣，提出许多善意的批评，但也露出少数错误的论调，他希望进一步大鸣大争，从争论中明辨是非。这个学院的民盟支部也在今天举行了支部大会，盟员教师热烈发言驳斥章伯钧等人的反社会主义言论，要划清思想界限，更诚恳地帮助共产党整风。运输系机车车辆教研组主任、民盟盟员钮泽全说，这次党委书记王孝慈的报告得到群众热烈的掌声，是一、二年所没有的，增强了党的威信。
    农业机械化学院机械系陈伯川教授说：我非常满意孙景鲁同志的检讨报告，虽然这个报告还不太详细，但是它表示了领导整风的决心。作教学研究工作的朱馨远说：这次报告消除了我对党委不少的误会，原来我以为党委怕疼，对改正缺点没有决心，听了报告以后，我认为党委的态度很诚恳，决心很大；最明显的是七个党委委员自动降了薪。
    北京石油学院非党教授和职工听了党委关于整风的检查报告以后，普遍认为这是实事求是的，表明了党组织整风的决心。副教务长吴迟认为，党委书记的检讨表现了边整边改的精神，他对今后整风的作法提出了一些建议。他说，有些像学校体制等原则问题不能一下子解决，应该在整风中组织专题研究。今后不要只是非党人士单方面鸣放，党员和领导干部也要开诚布公地提出自己的不同看法，这才能达到真正的“争鸣”。
    吴迟还提到最近学校领导对下学年教学准备工作注意得不够的问题，他希望学校领导今后要真正做到整风工作两不误。作过十八年教务工作的教务科副科长王裴庆说，党委的这次检查报告证明了党组织能够正视错误、改正错误。他说，这不仅是由于合理地调整了自己的工作，更重要的是党的领导非常诚恳、虚心。这样，整风中虽然提了许多尖锐的意见，可是群众和党是更加接近了。
