　　The Army and the People
　　Disaster Relief
    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: According to incomplete statistics, officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Nanjing area have donated nearly 400,000 yuan in disaster relief funds in two instances this year. Some of this money has been transferred to disaster-stricken areas in Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces that suffered last year. The officers and soldiers stationed on Hengsha Island in the Yangtze River estuary also took part of their salaries or allowances to help local people who suffered from typhoon disasters last year to solve their difficulties. At the same time, they also saved one or two taels of rice every day and entrusted the government to send it to residents with difficult lives.
    The officers and soldiers stationed in the Henan area responded to the call to save three jin of rice per person in the first quarter and donated a large amount of money. The grain they saved and the money they donated have also been sent to the people in the disaster area before the harvest season. In addition, a unit stationed in the Henan area also took the initiative to send a large number of vehicles to assist the local government in transporting disaster relief grain.
    Many disaster-stricken people and local governments who have been helped by the People's Liberation Army have written enthusiastic letters of thanks to the troops. "Chairman Mao's soldiers are good!" This is the evaluation of their army by the people in the disaster area.
　　Firefighting
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 20th: On the evening of the 5th, the leading organs of the Urumqi garrison suddenly received an emergency notice that the Nanshan pine forest, more than 100 kilometers away, was on fire, and immediately mobilized 200 officers and soldiers to rush to the scene by car to put out the fire. At this time, smoke and fire filled the high mountains 4,000 meters above sea level. The officers and soldiers participating in the fire fighting climbed to the top of the mountain quickly like combat, and dug a ditch more than one meter wide around the fire area to control the spread of the fire. In the raging fire, many people were very brave and finally extinguished the forest fire.
    Before this, more than 1,000 officers and soldiers of the Urumqi garrison also participated in extinguishing the fire in the Cooperation Bureau's warehouse. In this fire, the soldiers risked their lives to snatch many flammable items such as gasoline and a large number of other materials from the warehouse. Some soldiers were injured in the fire fighting.

　　救灾
    据新华社20日讯　据不完全统计，人民解放军驻南京地区各部队军官在今年先后二次所捐的救灾款数已近四十万元。这些钱有的已分别转交给安徽、江苏、浙江等省某些去年受灾地区的灾民。驻在长江口横沙岛上的部队官兵们，也拿出自己的薪金或津贴的一部分，帮助去年遭受台风灾害的当地人民解决困难。同时，他们还每天节约一两大米，托政府送给生活困难的居民。
    驻河南地区的部队官兵响应了每人在第一季度节约三斤米的号召，并且捐献了大批款项。他们所节约的粮食和捐款的款项，也已在青黄不接前送到灾区人民手中。此外，驻河南地区的某部还主动出动大批汽车，协助当地政府运送救灾粮食。
    许多受到解放军帮助的灾区人民和当地政府，给部队写来大批热情的感谢信。“毛主席的战士就是好啊！”这就是灾区人民给自己军队的评价。
　　救火
    据新华社乌鲁木齐20日电　5日晚，乌鲁木齐市驻军领导机关忽然接到一百多公里外的南山松林起火的紧急通知，便立即动员两百名官兵乘汽车赶往扑救。这时，拔海四千公尺的高山上烟火弥漫。参加救火的官兵像作战一样，快速攀登山顶，在火区的四周挖出一道一公尺多宽的沟，控制火势蔓延。在烈火中，许多人都十分英勇，终于将林火扑灭。
    在这以前，乌鲁木齐市驻军官兵一千多人，还参加扑灭了合作局库房的火灾。在这次大火中，战士们冒生命危险，从仓库中抢出许多汽油等易燃品和其它大批物资。救火中有部分战士负了伤。
