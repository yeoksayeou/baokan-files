Li Shizhang Refutes Huang Shaohong's Erroneous Statements, Arguing that Emphasizing Shortcomings and Underestimating Achievements Confuses Right and Wrong

　　I. On the Issue of Socialist Law
    Recently, in assisting the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement, some comrades discussed the country's legal issues. It seems that all our country's mistakes and shortcomings are due to the lack of complete laws, as if the law is above politics and class. It seems that in the past, without a complete set of laws, Party members made mistakes and work went wrong. I believe that this view is not in line with socialist principles. We should understand that law and politics are unified, not opposed. The state's political measures can be expressed through legal forms and transformed into reality through the power of law. The law is to safeguard the political and economic interests of the ruling class. The fundamental task of law is to protect these interests. The view that separates and opposes law and politics is, in essence, the bourgeoisie's attempt to confuse the socialist view of law and weaken the state system of people's democratic dictatorship by promoting the fairness and transcendence of law. This is extremely wrong and harmful. Looking at the actual situation in our country, in the years since liberation, has the absence of complete laws hindered the class struggle of the people and the development of social productive forces? The situation is not like this at all. Thanks to the correct policies of the Party and the People's Government, and thanks to some programmatic laws formulated based on these policies, we have not only destroyed the rule of imperialism, the landlord class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in China, enabling the people to truly be masters of their own affairs politically and economically, but also promoted the vigorous development of social productive forces, continuously improved the people's lives, and unprecedentedly enhanced our country's international status. This precisely shows that although we do not have complete laws (and it was impossible to have complete laws at the time), we still safeguarded the class interests of the people and achieved victory in the revolutionary struggle. Can it be said that the absence of complete laws is the root cause of all mistakes and problems? If there have been mistakes and problems, it can only be said that the peasants should not have struggled against the landlords, and the masses should not have suppressed the counter-revolutionaries. Now, the revolutionary storm has passed, and we need to gradually establish comprehensive laws to better protect the rights of citizens. However, our work in this area has not been timely enough. Many urgently needed, relatively complete basic laws, such as criminal law, civil law, and procedural law, have not yet been formulated. Our state organs, such as procuratorates, public security organs, and courts, also have shortcomings in implementing the rule of law. This is unsatisfactory.
    Some comrades also attribute the current low quality of trials and the occurrence of misjudged cases to the incompleteness of the law. This view is also subjective and one-sided. Although some cases are judged based on policies and regulations and lack a legal basis, it cannot be said that misjudged cases are entirely caused by the absence of a legal basis. We cannot imagine that after the civil law and criminal law are formulated, there will be no more misjudged cases. The fundamental issue is how to improve the policy level and legal professional knowledge of judges and procurators. Simply attributing misjudged cases to the absence of written laws is not in line with the actual situation.

　　II. On the Issue of "Emphasizing Achievements and Covering Up Mistakes."
    Mr. Huang Shaohong said: "Achievements are the main thing, deviations and mistakes are individual, this has become a formula... This will mean emphasizing achievements and covering up mistakes, creating the danger of more mistakes" (see the People's Daily, May 17).
    This is a reversal of right and wrong, a very harmful point of view. Because:
      (1) No one has covered up mistakes because they emphasized achievements. It is only said that achievements and mistakes should be estimated appropriately. State organs conduct self-examinations every year (from top to bottom and from bottom to top), the purpose of which is to correct mistakes. In state organs' work reports, mistakes are reviewed, and the words "achievements are the main thing, shortcomings and mistakes are individual" are written. I don't know how many materials need to be analyzed, how many meetings need to be held, and how much hard work needs to be spent. It cannot be said that this is a formula. This Party rectification is another major examination. How can it be said that mistakes are being covered up?
      (2) Mr. Huang has discovered some problems during his work inspections in the past few years, which is good for helping the government correct shortcomings. But to say that government departments are covering up shortcomings because of this is neither fair nor humble. Mr. Huang may have some cases in hand, but it should be understood that at all levels, procuratorial organs, state professional supervisory organs, and Party supervisory organs are fighting against shortcomings and mistakes every day. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of large and small cases are handled every year. Are the work of these organs all for covering up shortcomings? I work in the state supervisory organ, and I do not agree with such erasure of everything. However, I also admit that the work of these organs still has shortcomings, and we need to criticize it realistically.
      (3) Mr. Huang exaggerates the consequences of the shortcomings and mistakes in the judicial field as being too dark, sinister, and terrible. He says, "Two or three percent of wrong cases, nationwide, will cause how many families to be ruined and displaced!" It is a fact that our judicial work still has shortcomings. However, Mr. Huang is a current member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and should be aware of our country's lenient treatment of counter-revolutionary family members.
    These methods are detailed in the former Government Administration Council's "Regulations on Confiscating the Property of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals" and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress's "Decision on Lenient Treatment and Resettlement of Urban Residual Counter-Revolutionary Elements." The family members of counter-revolutionary elements have the same rights as ordinary citizens in terms of work and employment. If the property of counter-revolutionary elements is confiscated, a portion must be retained to provide for the family's livelihood. If the family members of counter-revolutionary elements have no means of livelihood, they can also receive the same social relief as ordinary residents. This is probably a benevolent government rarely seen in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, but Mr. Huang wants to describe it as "how many families being ruined and displaced." I have visited some labor reform farms where labor reform prisoners can even bring their families to live with them. What kind of "displacement" and what kind of "loss" is this?
      (4) Mr. Huang is not satisfied with "two or three percent of mistakes in national economic construction." This is a metaphysical point of view. This is equivalent to saying that people's understanding must reflect objective reality 100%, be able to predict things like a god, and not make any mistakes. I don't think Mr. Huang himself can do it. Of course, mistakes should be avoided as much as possible, but it cannot be said that no mistakes are allowed. If so, why should we oppose subjectivism?
      (5) Mr. Huang also advocates putting "mistakes and deviations before achievements, and saying that achievements are more conservative, so that they are consolidated and have reserve strength." If the fact is that mistakes and deviations are the main thing, I agree. If the fact is not like this, then achievements should be achievements, and shortcomings should be shortcomings, appropriately. Putting non-major deviations and mistakes before achievements is a practice of confusing right and wrong and disturbing people's hearts. It is not adopted by fair and upright people, and the common people will not agree to it either.

### 李世璋驳斥黄绍竑的错误言论，他认为：　强调缺点低估成绩是混淆是非

　　李世璋驳斥黄绍竑的错误言论，他认为：
　　强调缺点低估成绩是混淆是非
　　一，关于社会主义法律问题
    最近在帮助中共整风运动中，有的同志谈到国家的法律问题。好像我们国家一切错误和缺点都是由于没有完整的法律所产生的，似乎法律是超政治超阶级的，以往没有成套的法律，党员就犯了错误，工作就出了乱子。我认为这样的观点是不合乎社会主义原则的。我们应了解，法律与政治是统一的，不是对立的，国家的政治措施可以经过法律的形式获得表现，并借法律的力量变成现实，法律是维护统治阶级的政治利益和经济利益的。法律以保护这些利益为自己的基本任务。把法律和政治分裂起来、对立起来的观点，实质上是资产阶级通过宣扬法律的公正性超然性来混淆社会主义的法律观点、削弱人民民主专政的国家制度，这是十分错误和有害的。从我国实际情况看，解放几年来，是不是没有完整的法律就阻碍了人民群众的阶级斗争和社会生产力的发展呢？情况完全不是这样。由于有了党和人民政府的正确政策，由于有了根据政策所规定的一些纲领性的法律，我们不仅摧毁了帝国主义地主阶级官僚资产阶级在中国的统治，使人民在政治上经济上真正当了家作了主，而且社会生产力得到了蓬勃的发展，人民生活得到了不断的改善，我国的国际地位也获得了空前的提高。这正说明了我们虽然没有完整的法律（当时也不可能有完整的法律），但仍然维护了人民群众的阶级利益，取得革命斗争的胜利。这难道可以说没有完整的法律就是一切犯错误出乱子的根源吗？如果说犯了错误出了乱子，那就只能说农民不该斗地主，群众不该镇压反革命。现在，革命的暴风雨时期已经过去了，我们需要逐步建立完备的法律，才能更好地保障公民的权利。但是，我们在这方面的工作还不够及时，许多急需的较完整的基本法规，如刑法、民法、诉讼法等还没有制定出来，我们的检察、公安、法院等国家机关，在贯彻执行法制方面的工作上也还有缺点，这是不能令人满意的。
    还有的同志把目前审判质量不高发生错判案件的原因也归罪于法律的不完备，这种看法也是主观片面的。虽然有的案件是根据政策条例来判决的，还缺乏法规的依据，但不能说判错案件就完全是没有法律根据所造成的。我们不能设想到将来民法刑法制定后，就没有错判的案件，基本问题是如何提高审判、检察人员的政策水平和法律业务知识。单纯地把错判案件说成是没有成文法律是不符合实际情况的。
　　二，关于“强调成绩，掩盖错误”的问题。
    黄绍竑先生说：“成绩是主要的，偏差错误是个别的已成公式，……这样会意味着强调成绩，掩盖错误，造成更多错误的危险”（见5月17日人民日报）。
    这是一个颠倒是非的说法，一个十分有害的观点。因为：
      （一）谁也没有因为强调了成绩，便掩盖错误，只是说要把成绩和错误都估计得恰如其分。国家机关年年进行自我检查（自上而下和自下而上的检查），目的就是为了纠正错误，国家机关工作报告中检讨错误，写下“成绩是主要的，缺点错误是个别的”这几个字，不知道要分析多少材料，开多少会，花费多少辛勤的劳动，决不能说是公式。这次党进行整风又是一个大检查，怎么能说是掩盖错误呢？
      （二）黄先生这几年下去视察工作，发现了一些问题，这对于帮助政府纠正缺点是好的。但因此便说政府部门掩盖缺点，既不公道，也不谦虚。黄先生可能手上拿了一些案子，但应了解，各级检察机关、国家专业监察机关和党的监察机关，天天和缺点错误作斗争，估计每年要处理不下数十万的大小案件。难道这些机关的工作都是为了掩盖缺点吗？我在国家监察机关工作，如果这样抹煞一切，我是不服的。不过，我也承认，这些机关的工作都还有缺点，需要我们对它进行实事求是的批评。
      （三）黄先生把司法方面的缺点错误所造成的后果，说得太黑暗阴森，十分可怕。说什么“百分之二、三的错误案件，在全国范围内不知要造成多少人家家破人亡，流离失所！”我们的司法工作还有缺点，是事实。但是，黄先生是现任人大常委，对我们国家宽待反革命家属的办法应该是知道的。
    这些办法，详载于原政务院“关于没收反革命罪犯财产的规定”、全国人民代表大会常务委员会“关于宽大处理和安置城市残余反革命分子的决定”等法令指示中，反革命分子的家属，在工作和就业方面，和一般公民有同样的权利；如果没收反革命分子的财产，也要保留供给家属生活的一部分，如果反革命分子家属生活无着，也可以得到一般居民同样的社会救济。这恐怕是古今中外很少有的仁政，而黄先生却要把它说成是“多少人家家破人亡，流离失所。”我曾参观一些劳改农场，劳改犯人甚至可以把家属接去同居，他们是怎样的“流离”，怎样的“失所”呢？
      （四）黄先生不满意“国家经济建设有百分之二、三的错误”，这是一种唯心论的观点。这等于说人的认识要百分之百的反映客观实际，料事如神，一点错误也不犯。我看黄先生自己也作不到。当然，错误是应该尽量避免的，但不能说一点错误也不许有。若如此，我们为什么还要反对主观主义呢？
      （五）黄先生又主张把“错误、偏差放在成绩的前面，把成绩说得保守一点，才是巩固的、有后备力量的”。如果事实上错误、偏差是主要的，我也同意。如果事实并不如此，那么就应该成绩是成绩，缺点是缺点，恰如其分。把不是主要的偏差、错误硬放在成绩前面，是一种混淆是非、扰乱人心的作法。为公平正直的人所不取，老百姓也不答应。
