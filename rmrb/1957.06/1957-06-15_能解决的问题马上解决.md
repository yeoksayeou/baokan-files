　　Solve Problems Immediately
　　Rough materials can now be sent upstairs by machine
    The Dalian Lushun Potassium Chlorate Factory, following the spirit of learning, inspecting, and solving problems simultaneously, has been rapidly addressing issues raised by employees at the pre-session of the workers' representative assembly that can be resolved immediately. Workers in the finished product section of the electrolysis workshop used to carry more than forty boxes of raw materials upstairs from downstairs every day, which was tiring, and the workers had complaints. After the leading cadres personally participated in physical labor and discovered this situation, they instructed the power section to find a solution. After the technical personnel of this section worked hard, the raw materials can now be directly transported upstairs by machine. In order to take care of the employees with weak bodies and help them get healthy quickly, an amateur sanatorium was established in the dormitory building, with a nutritional canteen. To help employees in difficulty solve their living problems, they have also taken some positive measures, organizing family members of employees in difficulty to wash and mend old work clothes, break stones, etc., to increase income. In addition, the factory also distributed about forty mu of vacant land around the factory and family dormitories to more than seventy employee households to grow vegetables to subsidize their lives. In order to solve the problem of insufficient water for watering vegetables, the factory also dug a well for the employees, and the leading cadres personally participated in this labor. Because the leading cadres changed their work style and solved some problems, most employees felt satisfied.
    Eating is more convenient
    The Dalian Lushun Petroleum No. 7 Factory's staff canteen has increased the number of good dishes at noon from two or three to seven or eight. In terms of staple foods, in addition to steamed buns, rice, and corn cakes, pot cakes, noodles, steamed buns, etc., have recently been added. The time employees spend lining up for lunch has also been shortened from more than forty minutes in the past to less than five minutes.
    When studying the document on correctly handling contradictions among the people, the employees of this factory raised many internal problems of the factory, among which the most opinions were on the canteen, dormitory, and spare time allocation. The Party committee put forward specific opinions on improving the quality of food to the relevant functional departments, and actively gave play to the work enthusiasm and creativity of the cooks. In order to reduce crowding in the canteen, several steaming places were added inside the factory, and the Party committee mobilized employees with conditions to bring their lunch from home as much as possible.
    Deputy Director Visits Workshop Late at Night
    In the past, Wang Shifu, Deputy Director of the Dalian Lushun Knitting Factory, heard workers complaining that there was not enough hot water to drink on the night shift, "We have to drink cold water even when we take medicine," and thought it was a trivial matter and did not ask about it. After studying the document on correctly handling contradictions among the people, he personally went to the administration section to understand the reason. The head of the administration section said: "We fill the water tank at ten o'clock, how is it not enough? Maybe it was used by the second shift workers to wash their hands." In order to clarify the situation and solve the problem, he came to the factory at eleven o'clock at night and went to the knitting workshop and dyeing workshop to inspect the four water tanks. After inspection, it was found that there were only three pots of water in the water tank, and it was already cold. Deputy Director Wang looked at the ground and did not find any wet places, indicating that the water was not used by the workers to wash their hands, because there was too little water. The next day, at the factory director's collective office meeting, this issue was immediately studied, and it was decided to assign a handyman to the third shift to be responsible for supplying boiling water, and the problem was solved.

　　能解决的问题马上解决
　　粗料可以用机器送上楼去了
    旅大氯酸钾厂本着边学习、边检查、边解决的精神，对于职工在职工代表大会会前提出的目前能够解决的问题尽快地加以解决。电解车间成品工段工人过去每天从楼下往楼上扛四十多箱子的粗料，很累人，工人有意见。领导干部通过亲身参加体力劳动，发现这一情况后，便责成动力科设法解决。经过这个科的技术人员的一番努力，粗料现在已经可以用机器直接输送到楼上了。为了照顾身体弱的职工，使他们很快地健康起来，在宿舍大楼设立了一座业余疗养所，并设有营养食堂。为了帮助困难职工解决生活困难，他们也采取了一些积极措施，组织困难户职工家属洗补旧工作服、砸石子等以增加收入。此外，这个厂还将工厂和家属宿舍周围的约四十亩空地分给七十多户职工种菜，以补助他们的生活。为了解决浇菜水不足的困难，工厂还为职工打了一眼井，领导干部并亲自参加了这一劳动。由于领导干部改变了工作作风，解决了一些问题，大部分职工感到满意。
    吃饭方便了
    旅大石油七厂职工食堂每天中午的好菜已由两三样增加到七、八样，主食方面除了有馒头、大米饭和苞米饼子以外，新近又增添有锅饼、面条、包子……等。职工中午吃饭排队的时间也由过去的四十多分钟缩短到五分钟以内。
    这个厂的职工在学习有关正确处理人民内部矛盾文件时，提出了许多本厂内部的问题，其中尤以对食堂、宿舍和业余时间支配等问题的意见最多。党委向有关职能部门提出了提高伙食质量的具体意见，并积极发挥厨师们的工作积极性和创造性。为了减少食堂的拥挤现象，工厂内并增设了几处蒸饭处，党委动员有条件的职工中午尽量从家里带饭吃。
    副厂长深夜下车间
    过去，旅大针织厂王世福副厂长听到工人反映夜班热水不够喝，“我们吃药都得喝凉水”，认为是小事情，没有过问。经过学习正确处理人民内部矛盾的文件以后，他亲自到行政科去了解原因。行政科长说：“我们在十点钟就把水缸挑满啦，怎么不够？可能是被二班的工人洗手了吧。”为了弄清情况解决问题，他便在夜间十一点来到工厂，深入针织车间和漂染车间检查了四个装水缸。经过检查发现水缸里只有三壶水，并且已经凉了。王副厂长看了看地上，又没有发现湿的地方，可见水并没有被工人洗手用了，原因是水太少了。第二天在厂长集体办公会上立即研究了这个问题，决定在三班配备一名勤杂工专门负责供应开水，从此问题便解决了。　（以上据旅大日报）
