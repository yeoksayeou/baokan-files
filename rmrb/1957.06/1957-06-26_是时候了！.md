    "The Time Has Come!"
    Fan Bing
    "The time has come!" Rightists have openly put forward this "call." Of course, the meaning is not that "the time has come" to help the Party carry out rectification, but that "the Communist Party should step down," and that "the time has come" to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship and oppose socialism.
    After the rightists have wantonly insulted and slandered the Communist Party and the people, and after they have launched a frenzied attack on socialism, now, as far as we are concerned, indeed "the time has come!" It is time for the Communist Party, the working people, and all non-Party people who support socialism to counterattack the right-wing ambitious elements! It is time for us to defeat the right-wing ambitious elements' frenzied attack!

    “是时候了！”
    凡兵
    “是时候了！”右派分子公然提出了这个“号召”。意思当然不是说，帮助党来进行整风“是时候了”，而是说要“共产党下台”，推翻人民民主专政和反对社会主义“是时候了”。
    在右派分子对共产党和人民大肆辱骂污蔑之后，在他们对社会主义作了猖狂进攻之后，现在，在我们来说，也确“是时候了！”是共产党、劳动人民和一切拥护社会主义的党外人士向右派野心分子进行反击的时候了！是我们必须打垮右派野心分子猖狂进攻的时候了！
