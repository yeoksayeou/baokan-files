    Anhui Province Middle Schools Implement Agricultural Holiday
    This newspaper reports that Anhui Province has changed its previous holiday system for middle schools this year, replacing the original three-day spring holiday with a seven to ten-day agricultural holiday. The holiday time varies according to the different busy farming seasons in the northern and southern regions. Currently, many middle schools in central and southern Anhui Province have already had their holidays. Huaibei, where the wheat harvest is imminent, will also have a holiday soon. During the holidays, students who live close to home return to their villages to participate in production. Students who live far away are organized by the school to visit factories and agricultural cooperatives, or to participate in voluntary labor.
    Students who return home during the holidays strive to actively participate in agricultural production. Some learn to plow, harrow, transplant rice seedlings, and pick tea, while others carry bricks, fertilizer, and soil with the commune members, or do some household chores. In many places, students humbly learn and actively work after arriving at agricultural production cooperatives. The farmers respond very well, some saying: "These are truly good students of Chairman Mao, capable both intellectually and physically."
    In the past, middle schools in Anhui Province operated behind closed doors and were not integrated with production and education. Now, allowing students to return to their villages to participate in production during the holidays enables the integration of school labor education with practice, making it easier for them to return to their villages to participate in production after graduation.

　　劳动教育和实践相结合
    安徽省中学放农忙假
    本报讯  安徽省今年改变了中学历来的放假制度，将全省中学放三天春假的规定，改为七天到十天的农忙假。放假时间，根据南北地区农忙季节的不同有前有后。现在，安徽省中南部许多中学已经放过假了。淮北麦收在即，也将要放假。假期中，离家近的学生都回乡生产，离家远的学生，由学校组织参观访问工厂和农业社，或者组织参加义务劳动。
    假期回家的学生都争取积极的参加农业生产，有的学习犁田、耙田、插秧、摘茶，有的和社员一块挑砖、挑肥、挑土，或者作些家务劳动。许多地方的学生到了农业生产合作社以后，虚心学习、积极干活。农民反映很好，有的说：“这才是毛主席的好学生，又能文，又能武。”
    安徽省中学关门办学，没有和生产相结合教育。现在，假期让学生回乡参加生产，便可使学校劳动教育和实践结合起来，便于毕业后回乡参加生产。  （于风）
