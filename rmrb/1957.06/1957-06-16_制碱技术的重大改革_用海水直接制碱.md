　　Major Reform in Alkali Production Technology
　　Directly Producing Alkali from Seawater
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th: A method for directly producing alkali from seawater has recently been successfully researched in Tianjin. According to alkali industry experts, this is a major reform in alkali production technology. Currently, the Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Alkali Plant, one of the largest alkali plants in the country, is designing equipment for seawater alkali production. The method of using seawater to produce alkali was successfully tested by Liu Fuyuan, a technician at this plant, recently.
    The previous alkali production method involved dissolving crude salt into brine and then producing alkali.
    There is a salt field near this factory that produces 280,000 tons of salt annually, and in the past, the entire output was supplied to this factory, but it was still not enough to meet the needs. After adopting the new alkali production method, using only two-thirds of the salt field will be sufficient. 4 million yuan can be saved annually.

　　制碱技术的重大改革
　　用海水直接制碱
    据新华社天津15日电  用海水直接制碱的方法最近在天津研究成功。据制碱工业专家说：这是在制碱技术上的一个重大改革。目前，全国最大的制碱工厂之一的永利久大沽厂正在设计一种海水制碱的设备。利用海水制碱的方法，是这个工厂的技术人员刘福远在最近试验成功的。
    以前的制碱方法，是把粗盐溶成盐水，然后再制碱。
    这个工厂附近有一块年产二十八万吨盐的盐田，过去全部产品都供应这个工厂也不能满足需要；采取新的制碱法以后，只要利用其中三分之二的盐田就足够了。全年可以节约资金四百万元。
