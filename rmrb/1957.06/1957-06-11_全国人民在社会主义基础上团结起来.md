Unite the People of the Whole Country on the Basis of Socialism
The great unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has been formed through the tempering process of the democratic revolution, and the socialist revolution.

The struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism united the broadest masses of the Chinese people. This unity included workers, peasants, intellectuals, various urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and all patriotic individuals. Because the Chinese Communist Party stood most firmly and bravely at the forefront of the struggle, it became the core and leading force of this unity. Relying on the strength of this unity, the great victory of the democratic revolution was finally achieved.

After the victory of the democratic revolution, why did the great unity of the Chinese people continue to exist? Why didn't the various classes and strata participating in the democratic revolution disintegrate due to their conflicting interests? This is because a new common goal of struggle emerged before the Chinese people: to win the victory of the Socialist Revolution and Socialist construction. Although the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism had been overthrown, China was still a poor country, economically and culturally backward. Failure to change this backward state would inevitably lead to being beaten and enslaved and oppressed by imperialism again. The situation of the Chinese people living under the control of imperialism brought pain and humiliation to every patriot upon reflection. To ensure that the Chinese people never return to that kind of life, China must become a strong and industrialized country. To achieve this goal, there is only one path to take: socialism.

Apart from socialism, is there any other good path to take? Could we take the path of capitalism? Under the current historical conditions, what does taking the path of capitalism mean? It means becoming a colony in the imperialist world, at most a semi-colonial errand boy; it means opening the door to imperialist countries; it means allowing imperialism and its feudal and bureaucrat-capitalist running dogs, as always, to re-establish their rule in China. Therefore, after the democratic revolution, China could only choose between these two: either move forward toward socialism, or regress backward to the tragic and painful old China. There is no third way.

Socialism is primarily the cause of the working class, the cause of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. But under China's historical conditions, socialism can also obtain - and indeed has obtained - the support of patriotic people other than workers and peasants. The national bourgeoisie, although due to its class nature, cannot but feel resistant to the complete elimination of all systems of exploitation, after experiencing some doubts, hesitations, and vacillations, and relying on a series of efforts by the Chinese working class, the majority of them realized that socialism is the only way out for the Chinese nation, and therefore expressed their willingness to accept socialism. For many intellectuals who have been educated in the bourgeoisie and deeply influenced by bourgeois ideas in various ways, accepting socialism is not an easy task. As the socialist transformation progresses and the socialist system is established, various old ideas and old lifestyles that are only suitable for the private system must be changed, and many people cannot get used to the new things all at once. However, the vast majority of intellectuals have not retreated because of this situation. They increasingly see the progressiveness and justice of the socialist cause, and they increasingly realize that they should transform themselves to adapt to social progress, rather than thinking about adapting the social system to themselves.

To take the socialist road, it is inconceivable without the leadership of the working class, without the leadership of the Communist Party. In leading the cause of socialist revolution, the Chinese Communist Party has implemented the policy of uniting all forces that can be united, based on the worker-peasant alliance. The great revolutionary unity of the people of the whole country is a great force. Relying on this force, our country has now basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution and socialist transformation and has already made the first great achievements in large-scale socialist construction.

Now, socialism has not only become an irresistible belief for the vast majority of the Chinese people, but it has also become an unshakable track of development in practical life. Without socialism, there would be no independence and prosperity for our motherland, no freedom and happiness for our people, and no guarantee of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for 600 million people. This is very clear to the vast majority of Chinese people. Is there any force in the world that could tempt the Chinese people to leave the socialist road? To illustrate this point, let's take a look at the recent situation in which people from all walks of life are helping the Party's rectification movement. Some right-wing elements, attempting to use the rectification movement to oppose socialism and undermine the socialist cause, believed that their remarks would definitely gain widespread support among industrialists and businessmen. But the facts, as demonstrated by the situation in the symposium of industry and commerce circles held in Beijing, show that the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen were not deceived by the sweet words of the right-wing elements after all, and they refused to leave the socialist road. These right-wing elements also once thought that they could use the lack of social experience of young students to find allies among the student masses. But the facts have also proven that when the right-wing remarks exposed their true face of opposing socialism among the student masses, they were spurned by the vast majority of the masses. The right-wing elements attempted to open up a gap in the great unity of the Chinese people through industrialists and businessmen, intellectuals, and young students. This attempt has encountered a shameful failure, not to mention the delusion of carrying out any activities among workers and peasants. Their delusion will only receive a double blow.

It is not surprising that there are still a few right-wing elements in our country who oppose socialism, and these right-wing elements are still actively using various opportunities. The large-scale mass class struggle in our country has been basically resolved, but there is still class struggle, there is still class struggle on the political front, and there is still class struggle on the ideological front. The capitalist system has gone forever in our country, but there are still some people who are not reconciled, who do not believe that the socialist system can truly achieve victory, and who still want to find opportunities to change the course of history.

Past revolutionary experiences have proven that whenever the wheels of history move rapidly forward, some people will always be thrown out of the carriage. They cannot adapt to objective changes. But before they are thrown out, they often do not think that they are going to be thrown out, but instead think that the car is about to derail, about to be in bad luck, and that they will seize the opportunity to become truly knowledgeable figures who understand the times. The socialist revolution is a historically unprecedented and enormous change, and such a situation will inevitably occur in this great change. Some temporary imperfections and uncoordination that inevitably occur in the process of great changes and great reorganizations in society, in the eyes of the right-wing elements, show that the fate of socialism is already ominous, that the people have left the Communist Party, and that the people are tired of socialism. They think that if they jump out of this socialist train, thousands upon thousands of people will follow them.

These right-wing elements have miscalculated. The socialist cause, which is supported by the broadest masses of the people, will surely achieve greater and greater victories day by day. The great unity of the people of the whole country on the basis of socialism will also be consolidated day by day. The Chinese Communist Party has put forward the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, carrying out Party rectification, and asking people from all walks of life to help the Party with rectification and overcome various shortcomings in the Party's work. All of this is to consolidate the unity of the people. As a result of the Party's earnest efforts in this regard, the unity of the broad masses of the people across the country will inevitably be further consolidated.

To truly consolidate the unity within the people, it is necessary to conduct necessary struggles against right-wing elements who insist on opposing socialism, and it is necessary to draw a clear line between them and right-wing elements who insist on opposing socialism. The broadest masses of our people support socialism, support the people's democratic autocracy, and support the leadership of the Communist Party. Some people are temporarily unaccustomed to certain aspects of the new social system, and therefore have some temporary doubts, hesitations, and reservations, which is understandable. As time goes on, they will gradually adapt to the new life and actively participate in the construction of the new life. Therefore, their temporary doubts, hesitations, and reservations are completely different from the right-wing elements' hatred of the socialist system and must be strictly distinguished. People putting forward well-intentioned criticisms of certain phenomena in our social and national life, and putting forward well-intentioned criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in the work of Communist Party members, no matter how sharp these criticisms are, are extremely beneficial to the Party and the People's Government. We must accept all correct criticisms, correct errors, and improve our work. Even if this criticism is sometimes not completely correct, it is completely different from the right-wing elements' fundamental opposition to our social system and national system, and opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party, and must be strictly differentiated. Do we want socialism? Do we want the people's democratic dictatorship? Do we want Communist Party leadership? These are the most fundamental issues of right and wrong in our national life. The great unity of the Chinese people is based on a common understanding of such issues. Right-wing elements attempt to confuse people's understanding of these fundamental issues. All truly patriotic people who are willing to stand on the side of socialism should draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, so that the fundamental understanding of the issues of right and wrong can be made clearer. Only in this way can the great unity of the Chinese people on the basis of socialism be further consolidated.

Some right-wing elements originally styled themselves as remarkable heroes, thinking that their words and actions could affect the safety of the world. But they will eventually have to discover that if they do not fundamentally change their attitude toward socialism, they will be completely isolated and become pitiful creatures weeping in a corner. In other words, they will be thrown out of the train of the times. In contrast to their fate, the socialist train, based on the worker-peasant alliance and uniting the broadest masses of the people, will, under the guidance of the locomotive of the Communist Party, rumble forward day and night, toward an infinitely bright future.

### 全国人民在社会主义基础上团结起来

　　全国人民在社会主义基础上团结起来
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下的大团结，是经过民主革命和社会主义革命这两个革命的锻炼而形成起来的。
    为反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治而进行的斗争，使中国最广大的人民群众团结了起来。这个团结包括工人、农民、知识分子和各种城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级以及一切爱国人士。中国共产党因为最坚定地最英勇地站在斗争的最前面，所以成为团结的核心和领导力量。依靠这种团结的力量，终于取得了民主革命的伟大胜利。
    在民主革命取得胜利以后，为什么中国人民的大团结仍旧能够继续存在呢？为什么参加民主革命的各个阶级阶层没有因为彼此的利害矛盾而分崩离析呢？这是因为中国人民面前出现了一个新的共同的奋斗目标，这个目标就是争取社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利。虽然已经推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，但是中国仍旧是一个贫穷的在经济和文化上落后的国家。不改变这种落后的状态，就免不了挨打，就免不了重新遭受帝国主义的奴役和压迫。中国人在帝国主义支配下过活的情况，每个爱国人士一回想到就感到痛苦和屈辱。要使中国人永远不至于再回到那种生活去，就必须使中国成为富强的工业化的国家。而要达到这个目的，就只有走社会主义这一条路。
    除了社会主义，难道还有什么别的路好走么？难道可以走资本主义的路么？在当前的历史条件下，走资本主义的路是什么意思呢？就是在帝国主义世界里做个殖民地，至多是做半殖民地式的小伙计，就是把大门向帝国主义国家打开，就是让帝国主义和它的向来使用惯了的封建主义和官僚资本主义的走狗在中国重新建立起统治。所以中国在民主革命以后事实上只能在这二者中选择其一：或者向前走向社会主义，或者向后倒退到那种悲惨的痛苦的旧中国去。第三条道路是没有的。
    社会主义首先是工人阶级的事业，是工人阶级领导下的工农联盟的事业，但是在中国的历史条件下，社会主义还能够取得——而且也确实取得了——在工人农民以外的爱国人民的拥护。民族资产阶级，虽然由于其阶级本性，不能不对于彻底消灭一切剥削制度这件事感到抵触，但是依靠中国工人阶级的一系列努力，他们的大多数经过了一些怀疑、观望、徘徊、动摇以后，看到了社会主义是中国民族的唯一出路，因而表示愿意接受社会主义。对于许多受过资产阶级教育、从各方面深刻感染到资产阶级思想影响的知识分子，接受社会主义也不是一件很容易的事。随着社会主义改造的进展和社会主义制度的建立，各种只适合于私有制度的老的想法和老的生活方式必须改变，而对于新的东西，许多人并不是一下子就能习惯的。但是绝大多数知识分子并没有因为这种情形而退却。他们越来越看到社会主义事业的进步性和正义性，他们也就越来越认识到，应当改造自己来适应于社会的进步，而不应当设想使社会制度适应于自己。
    要走社会主义的路，没有工人阶级的领导，没有共产党的领导是不能设想的。中国共产党在领导社会主义革命事业中实行了以工农联盟为基础，团结一切可以团结的力量的方针。全国人民的革命大团结是一个伟大的力量，依靠这种力量，我国现在已经使社会主义革命和社会主义改造基本上取得胜利，而且已经在大规模的社会主义建设中取得了第一步的巨大成就。
    现在，社会主义不但已经成为中国绝大多数人民的不可抗拒的信念，而且已经成为实际生活的不可动摇的发展轨道。没有社会主义，就没有我们祖国的独立、富强，就没有我国人民的自由、幸福，就不能保证六亿人口的衣食住行，这对于绝大多数的中国人说来，已经是非常明白的道理。世界上难道还有什么力量能够引诱中国人民离开社会主义的道路么？为了说明这个问题，我们不妨看一看最近期间，在社会各界人士帮助党的整风运动的情形。企图利用整风运动来反对社会主义、破坏社会主义事业的一些右派分子以为，他们的言论一定能够在工商业者中间得到广泛的支持。但是事实正像在北京举行的工商界座谈会中的情形所证明的，绝大多数的工商业者终究并没有为右派分子的甜言蜜语所迷惑，他们拒绝离开社会主义道路。这些右派分子又曾经以为可以利用青年学生的缺少社会经验而在学生群众中找到同盟军。但是事实也已经证明，当右派言论在学生群众中暴露出反对社会主义的真面目的时候，就遭到了绝大多数群众的唾弃。右派分子企图经过工商业者、知识分子和青年学生而打开中国人民大团结的缺口，这种企图已经遭遇到可耻的失败，当然更不用说要在工人农民中进行什么活动的妄想了。他们的这种妄想只会得到双倍的打击。
    我国目前还有少数反对社会主义的右派分子存在，这些右派分子还在利用各种机会积极活动，这并不是什么奇怪的事。大规模的群众性的阶级斗争在我国已经基本上解决了，但是还有阶级斗争，还有政治战线上的阶级斗争，还有思想战线上的阶级斗争。资本主义制度已经在我国一去不可复返，但是总有一些人还不死心，还不相信社会主义制度真能取得胜利，还想寻找机会来改变历史的进程。
    过去的革命经验证明，每当历史的车轮急剧地前进的时候，总会有些人从车厢中抛出来。他们不能适应客观的变化。可是在他们被抛出以前，他们往往并不认为自己要被抛出，反而以为车子快要出轨了，快要倒霉了，而他们却将夤缘时会，成为真正识时务的角色。社会主义革命是一个历史上空前的巨大变革，在这种大变革中更不会不发生这种情形。社会处在大变革大改组的过程中所必然发生的某些暂时性的不完善不协调，从右派分子的眼中看起来，就是表明社会主义的命运已经不妙了，人民已经离开共产党了，人民已经讨厌社会主义了。他们以为，他们一跳出这个社会主义的列车，就会有千千万万人跟着他们一起走。
    这些右派分子的算盘打错了。受到最广大的人民群众拥护的社会主义事业一定能一天天取得更大的胜利。在社会主义基础上的全国人民大团结也一定会一天天更加巩固起来。中国共产党提出正确地处理人民内部的矛盾的方针，进行党的整风，要求社会各界人士帮助党整风，克服党的工作中的各种缺点，这都是为了巩固人民的团结。而党认真这样作的结果，全国广大人民的团结也必然更加巩固。
    为了真正巩固人民内部的团结，必须同坚持反对社会主义的右派分子进行必要的斗争，必须同坚持反对社会主义的右派划清界限。我们的最广大的人民群众是拥护社会主义、拥护人民民主专政、拥护共产党的领导的。有一部分人对于新的社会制度的某些方面暂时还觉得不习惯，因而暂时有些怀疑、动摇和保留，这是可以理解的。随着时间的推移，他们终将逐渐适应新的生活，并且积极参加新生活的建设。因此，他们的某些暂时的怀疑、动摇和保留，同右派分子的仇视社会主义制度是完全不同，必须严格区别的。人们对于我们的社会生活和国家生活中的某些现象提出善意的批评，对于共产党员的工作中的缺点错误提出善意的批评，无论这些批评怎样尖锐，对于党和人民政府都是极其有益的。我们必须接受一切正确的批评，纠正错误，改进工作。即使这种批评有时并不完全正确，但是同右派分子的根本反对我们的社会制度和国家制度，反对共产党的领导，也是完全不同，必须严格区别的。要不要社会主义？要不要人民民主专政？要不要共产党的领导？这是我们的国家生活中的最根本的是非问题。中国人民的大团结就是建立在对这样的问题的共同认识上面。右派分子企图混淆人们在这种根本问题上的认识。一切真正爱国的、愿意站在社会主义方面的人就应当同右派划清界限，使对于是非问题的根本认识更加明确起来。只有这样，中国人民在社会主义基础上的大团结才能够更加巩固。
    有些右派分子本来自命为了不起的英雄，以为他们的一言一动能够影响天下的安危。但是他们终于不能不发现，如果他们不根本改变他们对于社会主义的态度，他们就将完全孤立，变为向隅而泣的可怜虫。换句话说，他们就将被抛出时代的列车以外。同他们的命运相反，以工农联盟为基础、团结最广大的人民群众的社会主义列车，必将在共产党的火车头的引导下，日夜不停地轰隆轰隆地前进，向着无限光明的未来前进。
