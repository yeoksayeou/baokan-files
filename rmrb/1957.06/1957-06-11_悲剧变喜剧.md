　　Tragedy Turns into Comedy
    The United States recently published a voluminous work of nine hundred and twenty-seven pages, recounting the shocking details of the U.S. Congress's hearings on traffic accidents: the U.S. experiences as many as twenty million traffic accidents a year, with one million three hundred thousand injuries, one hundred thousand cases of total and permanent disability, forty thousand immediate deaths, and property losses amounting to four billion five hundred million dollars. It is no wonder that the American "Nation" magazine called this book the "bloodiest" record of the U.S. Congress.
    Although the problem is so serious, the members of Congress who participated in the meeting, the national and state officials in charge of traffic safety (including judges), witnesses, and representatives of large automobile companies seemed very relaxed. Moreover, they actually found a way to make money from the death toll.
    The representative of the Ford Motor Company suggested that, for the "safety" of highways, all old cars should be banned first. This is a truly wonderful idea. If this is implemented, new cars will inevitably fill the "vacuum," and the large stock of new cars accumulated by the automobile companies can also be sold smoothly.
    The former chairman of the judicial group of the National Safety Council has another plan. He argued that excessive horsepower of cars contributes to the increase in traffic accidents and suggested: "Congress should revise the current consumption tax rules so that taxes can be levied at different rates according to the horsepower of cars."
    Members of Congress are probably more proficient in the American way of life, so their views are even more insightful. One congressman thought that four spoonfuls of honey could sober up a drunkard, so he advocated adding honey to all the wine in bars, saying it was to reduce traffic accidents caused by drunkenness, but in reality, people can smell the coppery odor of the sugar bosses from here.
    Wonderful plans each have their own merits, but the taste is the same. For these great gentlemen, even tragedies like massive car deaths can be turned into money-making comedies. What they care about is not human life, but the blood of people that can be condensed into dollars. (Ge)

　　悲剧变喜剧
    美国最近出版了一本长达九百二十七页的大作，叙述美国国会关于交通案件意见听取会的惊人情况：美国一年所发生的交通案件竟达两千万起，因车祸而受伤的人数达一百三十万，全部和终身残废的十万人，当场毙命者四万人，损失的财产计达四十五亿美元。难怪美国的“民族”周刊把这本书称为美国国会“最血腥的”记录。
    虽然问题是如此严重，但是，参加会议的国会议员、国家和各州负责交通安全的官员（包括法官）、见证人和大汽车公司的代表先生们却显得十分轻松。而且居然还从死亡录中找到了生财之道。
    福特汽车公司大老板的代表建议，为了公路的“安全”，首先应禁止所有的旧汽车通行。这真是绝妙好计。照此实行，势必新汽车一律填补“真空”，而汽车公司积存的大量新汽车也就可以畅销了。
    国家安全委员会前司法小组的主席，有着另一打算。他以汽车马力太大促成车祸增加为由，建议：“国会应该修改现行的消费税则，以便按汽车马力的大小来课以多寡不同的税收。”
    国会议员大概是比较精通美国生活方式，所以他们的见解更高人一等。有一位议员先生想到四调羹蜜糖可以使一个醉汉苏醒，因而主张各酒吧间在所有的酒里都加添蜜糖，说是为了减少因酗酒而造成的车祸，实则人们可以从这里闻到糖业老板的铜臭气味。
    妙计各有千秋，而口味则无二致。对于这些大人先生们来说，即使像汽车大量压死人的悲剧，也可以变为挣钱的喜剧。他们关心的，不是人的生命，而是可以凝成美元的人的鲜血。  （葛）
