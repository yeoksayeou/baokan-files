    Laboring and studying simultaneously, engaging in work-study programs, is a very meaningful learning method for the majority of students at present.
    We know that there are many moving stories of work-study in Chinese history. Li Mi of the Sui Dynasty and Wang Mian of the Yuan Dynasty both studied while tending cattle for others. Their excellent academic achievements have been passed down as fine stories. Among the leading personnel of our Party and country, many went to France forty years ago to participate in work-study programs, using the method of part-work and part-study to pursue their education. Work-study is a fine tradition of Chinese intellectuals. It is very necessary to inherit and develop this fine tradition.
    What kind of people does our country need young students to become in the future? The country needs students to become builders of the motherland, mainly to become excellent, cultured workers and peasants. Therefore, they should participate in ordinary physical labor in the future, and should combine mental and physical labor. This requires schools to focus on labor education for young people, so that young people not only acquire book knowledge during their studies, but also receive physical labor training, master certain production skills, establish correct labor attitudes, and cultivate the ideological feelings of sharing weal and woe with the working people.
    The labor education of students is a major issue in our country's education work. In the schools of the old liberated areas in the past, students were laboring and studying simultaneously. In recent years, the education departments have repeatedly emphasized that labor education for students is one of the important contents of ideological education in schools. However, due to the lack of specific research and leadership in this work, the labor education in some schools only stays at the level of general appeals and empty talk. This has led some students to be "unskilled in physical labor and unable to distinguish the five grains," to despise physical labor, and to only value book knowledge. Many students blindly demand to go to higher schools, to become experts, to become cadres, and are unwilling to participate in industrial and agricultural production. This is an abnormal phenomenon.
    Organizing students to participate in after-school labor is an effective method to strengthen labor education. In labor practice, students can not only cultivate the habit of loving labor, master practical production skills, and acquire practical production knowledge, but also truly realize the meaning and glory of labor ideologically. At present, many schools in various places have students who participate in production labor during their spare time and holidays, gradually developing the habit of labor and a frugal style, and improving their understanding of labor. Some graduating students from Xuchang No. 2 Junior Middle School in Henan Province, whose homes are in rural areas, have improved their understanding through production labor. They wrote letters to the cadres in their hometowns, expressing their determination to return home after graduation to participate in agricultural production and become the first generation of cultured farmers.
    According to the current development of education in our country, in the foreseeable future, more primary and middle school graduates will not be able to enter higher schools every year, but will have to participate in labor production, mainly agricultural production. Even the small number of students who go on to higher education according to the needs of the country will also participate in production and construction in the future. Therefore, during their studies, it is very necessary to let them participate in some after-school labor to prepare for future participation in labor production.
    Advocating after-school labor can also help students solve part of their study and living expenses, and reduce the burden on their families and the state to provide for students' education. The cost of studying for a student is very high. Taking a middle school student as an example, the family has to spend an average of 100 yuan per year. Due to our country's past economic backwardness, although the lives of the broad masses of people have improved after liberation, the lives of some working people are still difficult, and it is impossible for them to have more surplus money to support their children to study. Although the state spends a lot of money on education every year, and has scholarships to help students from poor families to study, it cannot meet the needs of every student. According to the situation of some schools in some areas organizing students to engage in after-school labor, the income is not small. Many students in some middle schools in Henan Province have solved the problems of study expenses and living difficulties through after-school labor. For example, a student in Xiping No. 1 Middle School fishes once or twice a week and earns income, so he automatically gives up the scholarship. Last year, the 700 students in Zhengzhou No. 7 Middle School earned more than 10,400 yuan from after-school labor, which is more than the school's total scholarship of more than 8,600 yuan last year. Because of these incomes, some students who had difficulties in study expenses are no longer in difficulty, their lives have been improved, and they have reduced the burden on their families. Many students have also reduced or given up the requirements for scholarships.
    What kind of labor can students participate in during their spare time? We believe that schools closer to the countryside should organize students to participate in agricultural production, and in order to solve the problems of food, accommodation and agricultural tools more easily, they should try to mobilize students to return to their hometowns to help with labor. These schools can do a good job of ideological mobilization and organization for students before the farm busy season vacation, so that students can understand the significance of returning to their hometowns to help with labor during the farm busy season vacation and the issues that should be paid attention to, and require students to return to their hometowns to help with labor in a positive manner, and strictly abide by the labor discipline and various systems of the local agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the school can also group and team students according to their family addresses, designate the responsible students of each team and group, contact the relevant agricultural cooperatives, and specifically arrange the time, place and farm work for students to return to their hometowns to help with labor, so that students can start activities as soon as the farm busy season vacation begins. Schools in cities can also contact nearby factories, basic construction sites, various service industries, or agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, so as to organize urban students to participate in temporary production activities. Regarding the remuneration for students helping with labor, the school should study and decide with the relevant units in advance. Schools should, within the possible scope, coordinate with classroom teaching and provide guidance from the perspective of scientific knowledge for students participating in after-school production labor, so as to combine labor and learning. On the one hand, students' participation in after-school labor should rely on schools and families to take the initiative to find ways and contact relevant units; on the other hand, it should also rely on the strong support of relevant units to help them prepare labor conditions, so that students can participate in certain labor during holidays.
    Some people worry that advocating after-school labor will affect students' studies and health. We believe that the problem lies in how to arrange it well. After-school labor must be carried out in spare time or holidays, and the principle of not affecting students' learning quality must be strictly observed. If arranged well, it will not only not hinder learning, but will enrich students' practical knowledge. Kuang Shizhen, a student of Guangzhou No. 15 Middle School, goes to barber shops to do odd jobs every holiday, or sets up barber stalls in the streets and alleys, and sometimes uses his rest time to cut hair for students and teachers in the school, and also makes full use of the winter and summer vacations to do some temporary odd jobs such as carrying mud, repairing roads, and pushing carts. Although participating in social labor has taken up a lot of his time and energy, he has always maintained excellent academic performance and has been praised by the Municipal Youth League Committee as a "three-good" student. This shows that as long as it is arranged properly, participating in after-school labor will not affect students' studies.
    For students participating in labor, specific arrangements should be made according to their age, physical condition, etc. During the period of young people's physical and mental development, appropriate participation in physical labor is very beneficial to their health, but excessive physical labor should be avoided, otherwise it will affect students' health. Therefore, in order to enable all regions to do this work well, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership. The education department should promptly summarize and promote good experiences in this area, and pay attention to correcting the deviations that may occur in carrying out this work, so that students can truly achieve the requirements of being good in health, good in learning, and good in work.

### 一面劳动，一面读书

    一面劳动，一面读书
    一面劳动，一面读书，勤工俭学，对目前广大学生来说，是一种很有意义的学习方法。
    我们知道，勤工俭学的动人事迹，在我国历史上是很多的。隋朝的李密、元朝的王冕，都是一面替人放牛，一面读书。他们学习的成绩优良，被传为美谈。在我们党和国家的领导人员中，就有不少人在四十年前参加勤工俭学会到法国去，用半工半读的方法来求学。勤工俭学是我国知识分子的优良传统。继承和发扬这个优良传统，是很有必要的。
    我们国家需要青年学生将来成为怎样的人呢？国家需要学生成为祖国的建设者，主要是成为优秀的有文化的工人和农民。因此，他们将来应该参加普通的体力劳动，并且要做到脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合。这就要求学校抓紧对青年进行劳动教育，使青年在求学时代不仅获得书本知识，而且受到体力劳动的锻炼，掌握一定的生产技能，树立正确的劳动态度，培养同劳动人民共甘苦的思想感情。
    学生的劳动教育，是我国教育工作中的一个重大问题。过去老解放区的学校中，学生们就是一面劳动，一面读书的。这几年来，教育部门也一再强调对学生进行劳动教育是学校思想教育的重要内容之一。但是由于对这一工作还缺乏具体的研究和领导，有些学校的劳动教育只是停留在一般号召和空洞地讲道理方面。这就使有的学生“四体不勤、五谷不分”，轻视体力劳动，只重视书本知识。不少学生一味要求升学，当专家，当干部，不愿意参加工农业生产。这是一种不正常的现象。
    组织学生参加课余劳动，正是加强劳动教育的一个有效方法。学生在劳动实践中，不但可以培养热爱劳动的习惯，掌握实际的生产技能，获得实际的生产知识，而且能真正从思想上认识到劳动的意义和光荣。目前各地已有许多学校的学生利用课余时间和假期参加生产劳动，逐渐养成了劳动的习惯和俭朴的作风，提高了对劳动的认识。河南省许昌第二初中有些家在农村的应届毕业生，通过生产劳动，提高了认识。他们写信给本乡干部，表示毕业后决心回家参加农业生产，做第一代有文化的农民。
    根据目前我国教育事业的发展情况来看，在今后相当长的时期中，每年将有更多的小学和中学毕业生不能升学，而要参加劳动生产，主要是农业生产。就是小部分根据国家需要升学深造的学生，将来也是要参加生产建设的。因此，在他们的学习期间，让他们参加一些课余劳动，为以后参加劳动生产作好准备，这是很需要的。
    提倡课余劳动，对学生来说，还可以帮助他们解决一部分学习和生活费用，减轻家庭和国家供应学生求学的负担。一个学生的学习花费是很大的，就以一个中学生来说，平均每年家里要拿出一百元钱。由于我国过去经济落后，解放后广大人民的生活虽然有所提高，但是一部分劳动人民的生活还有困难，不可能有更多的余钱供给子女念书。国家虽然每年在教育事业中花了很多钱，并且设有助学金来帮助家庭贫困的学生念书，但是也不能满足每个学生的需要。根据目前有些地区的学校组织学生从事课余劳动的情况来看，收入还是不小的。河南省部分中学的不少学生通过课余劳动，就解决了学习费用和生活困难问题。如西平县一中的一个学生每周打一、二次鱼，有了收入，他就自动放弃了助学金。郑州第七中学全校七百个同学，去年一年课余劳动所得即达一万零四百多元，比全校去年八千六百多元的助学金总数还要多。由于有了这些收入，有些在学习费用上比较困难的同学不困难了，生活还有了改善，减轻了家庭负担，还有不少学生降低或放弃了助学金的要求。
    学生在课余可以参加一些什么劳动呢？我们认为，离乡村较近的学校应该组织学生参加农业生产，并且为了比较容易解决膳、宿和农具等问题，尽量动员学生回本乡帮助劳动。这些学校可以在放农忙假以前，对学生做好思想动员工作和组织工作，使学生认识到利用农忙假回乡帮助劳动的意义和应注意的问题，要求学生以积极的态度回乡帮助劳动，并严格遵守当地农业社的劳动纪律和各项制度。同时学校还可根据学生家庭住址进行分组编队，指定各队、组的负责同学，与有关农业社取得联系，具体安排好学生回乡帮助劳动的时间、地点和农活，以便农忙假一开始，学生就可展开活动。在城市的学校，也可以和附近的工厂、基本建设工地，各种服务性行业，或者郊区的农业社取得联系，以便组织城市学生参加临时的生产活动。关于学生帮助劳动的报酬，学校应事先和有关单位研究决定。学校对学生参加课余生产劳动，应在可能范围内，配合课堂教学，从科学知识方面予以指导，使劳动和学习结合起来。学生参加课余劳动，一方面固然要靠学校、家庭主动想办法和有关单位取得联系；另一方面还要靠有关单位的大力支持，帮助他们准备劳动条件，使学生能利用假日参加一定的劳动。
    有人担心，提倡课余劳动，会不会影响到学生的学习和健康？我们认为，问题在于怎样很好地安排。课余劳动必须是在课余或假期进行，要严格遵守不影响学生的学习质量的原则。安排得好，不但不会妨碍学习，反而会丰富学生的实际知识。广州市十五中学学生邝仕贞每逢假日就到理发店里做散工，或者在横街小巷摆理发摊，有时还利用休息时间给校内同学和教工们理发，并充分利用寒暑假期做些担泥、修路、推车等临时杂工。虽然参加社会劳动花去了他不少时间和精力，但他一直保持着优良的学习成绩，并被团市委表扬为“三好”学生。这就说明，只要安排得当，参加课余劳动是可以不影响到学生学习的。
    对于参加劳动的学生，要根据他们年龄的大小、身体好坏等情况来具体安排。在青年身心发育成长的时期，适当地参加体力劳动，对他们的健康是十分有益的，但是要避免过重的体力劳动，不然会影响学生健康。因此，要使各地做好这一工作，还需要加强领导。教育部门应该及时总结和推广这方面好的经验，并注意纠正在开展这一工作中可能发生的偏向，使学生真正能达到身体好、学习好、工作好的要求。
