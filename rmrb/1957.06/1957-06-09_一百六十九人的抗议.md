    A Protest from One Hundred and Sixty-Nine People

    Comrade Editor:

    We, the workers of the state-owned Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, were enraged after seeing the speeches of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others in the newspaper! This isn't offering opinions! This is slandering the Party! We will never allow them to slander the working class's party – the Communist Party!

    We originally intended to have a meeting with a dozen or so people to discuss it, but the news spread, and suddenly more than one hundred and sixty people came. Everyone was extremely angry, vying to speak, and many even wrote written statements.

    First and foremost, everyone strongly condemned the act of writing threatening letters. Writing threatening letters is a shameless and despicable act! If you are upright and have opinions, you should raise them directly. Doesn't this precisely show that they have a guilty conscience!

    We protest Chu Anping calling the current people's world a "Party's world." It is outrageous that he calls Chairman Mao an "old monk." Some of our factory's veteran workers said after listening to his speech that he is supposed to be an intellectual, but how can his speech be less refined than that of us roughnecks?

    Ge Peiqi said that only some Party members and cadres have had their lives improved since liberation. He is simply talking nonsense. Taking the lives of our factory's workers as an example, they are vastly different from before liberation. Now, on average, there is one radio for every three or four workers in our factory. Take the veteran worker Liu Fengqing (with more than twenty years of service) as an example. In the old society, he had to work a whole day to earn a day's meal; if he didn't work, he had nothing to eat. He ate cornmeal buns. He wore a tattered cotton-padded jacket that he dared not take apart for five years because he wouldn't be able to sew it back together. His wife and children wore old and torn clothes given by poor relatives. During the Spring Festival, the children couldn't even wear a new set of clothes. Now he is a Grade 6 worker and has a watch, a bicycle, and a radio in just a few years! Isn't this an improvement in life?

    Ge Peiqi also said that the pork shortage is because Party members and cadres eat it all. His statement is truly strange! We don't know if Ge Peiqi has ever been to the streets or seen the long queues of people buying meat? Are they all Party members and cadres? If Ge Peiqi doesn't understand the lives of the masses, we can invite him to our factory to see the food we eat. Where has the pork gone? We say it has all gone into everyone's stomachs!

    Ge Peiqi also said that the Communist Party doesn't serve the people. Then we have to ask him, if there were no Communist Party's leadership, how could China build socialism? Who built the seamless steel pipe factory, the First Automobile Works, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge? Taking our factory as an example, if there were no Communist Party's leadership, how could it have grown from a factory of dozens of people to a large factory of more than a thousand people? Our factory was established in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, it was just a broadcasting equipment repair shop that could only repair radios. After liberation, it not only makes radios but also complex 120-kilowatt transmitters. Not only that, but we will soon build a new factory that is several times larger than the current one. If this isn't serving the people, who is it serving? The people's eyes are sharp, and they know that the current relationship between the Party and the masses is not ten thousand miles apart from that before liberation, but is becoming closer and closer.

### 一百六十九人的抗议

专栏：读者来信

    一百六十九人的抗议编辑同志：
    我们国营北京广播器材厂的职工，在看到报上登的葛佩琦、储安平等人的发言后，大伙都火起来了，这那叫提意见！这是诬蔑党，我们决不允许他们诬蔑我们工人阶级的政党——共产党！
    我们原想十几个人在一块开个会谈谈，那知道消息一传出去，一下子来了一百六十多人。大伙都气极了，争着要发言，好多人还写了书面发言。
    大伙首先痛斥了写恐吓信的行为。写恐吓信这是无耻卑鄙的勾当！你既然光明正大，有意见就应该正面提，这不正是说明他心里有鬼！
    我们抗议储安平把现在人民的天下叫做党天下。他把毛主席叫做老和尚，太不像话了。我们工厂一些老工人听了他的发言都说，他还是个知识分子呢，怎么说话还没我们老粗文雅。
    葛佩琦说解放后生活提高的只是一些党员干部。他简直是胡说八道。拿我们厂职工的生活来说，就和解放以前大不一样了。现在我们全厂职工平均三四个人就有一个收音机。像老工人刘风清（有二十多年工龄）。过去在旧社会，干一天活吃一天饭，不干活就没吃的。吃的是棒子面窝头。穿的是一件烂棉袄，五年不敢拆，只要一拆，就对不起来了。老婆孩子穿的都是穷亲戚给的旧衣烂衫。过年的时候，孩子都穿不上一身新衣服。现在他是六级工，几年功夫有了手表、自行车和收音机！这不是生活提高了是什么？
    葛佩琦还说，猪肉紧张都是党员干部吃了。他这说法可真奇怪！我们不知道葛佩琦有没上过街，有没见过那一长溜一长溜的买肉的人？难道那都是党员干部？葛佩琦如果不了解群众生活情况，还可以请他到我们工厂看一看我们吃的饭。猪肉那里去了，我们说，都吃到大伙肚子里去了！
    葛佩琦还说，共产党不为人民服务。那我们得问问他，要是没共产党的领导，中国怎么能建设社会主义；无缝钢管厂、第一汽车厂、武汉长江大桥是谁造的？再拿我们厂来说，要是没共产党领导，那怎么会从几十个人的厂变成一千多人的大厂？我们这个厂是抗战时在重庆成立的。那时只是个广播器材修配厂，只能修修收音机，解放后不但作收音机，而且还能作很复杂的一百二十瓩的广播机。不但这样，不久我们还要另建一个新厂，规模比现在的厂大好几倍。这不是为人民服务，是为谁服务？老百姓的眼睛是雪亮的，他们知道现在的党群关系，不是比解放前相差十万八千里，而是越来越密切了。

           雷定一、王英怡、潘良洪等一百六十九人
