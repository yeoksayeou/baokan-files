    This newspaper reports that Yunnan University has adopted the method of individual heart-to-heart talks in resolving internal contradictions among the people, and has achieved remarkable results.
    Initially, they also used the method of symposiums, and many opinions were expressed, but everyone only disclosed information to the extent that it was revealed in the newspapers. The Yunnan University Party Committee studied this situation and realized that to achieve "sincere confession," in addition to paying attention to the law of ideological development and adopting a gentle and gradual approach, it was also necessary to consider the characteristics of intellectuals and the specific situation of the school. Intellectuals have strong self-esteem and are more concerned about face. People who are criticized at meetings find it more difficult to accept, and those who offer opinions have many concerns. Some issues involve a wide range of people, making it even more inconvenient, and it is also easy to become impulsive and lead to deadlock at meetings. Therefore, they decided to adopt individual heart-to-heart talks in addition to symposiums. Each leading Party cadre, knowing who had the most opinions about them, took the initiative to sincerely seek them out for conversation. During the talks, except for some misunderstandings between each other, they generally did not rush to explain, but focused on the correct opinions to conduct self-criticism, and expressed their determination to be close friends. If one talk was not enough, they had two, and if two were not enough, they had three, until everyone had sincerely confessed everything. Zhang Qijun, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs, and Wang Shikui, Director of Academic Affairs, in the past felt that the Party Committee did not respect their opinions enough. All matters were only discussed at meetings, without proper consultation with them beforehand, making them feel like "stone lions at the temple gate, only there for show," and they had many opinions. They had been engaged in teaching reform for five years, but they actually did not approve of the teaching reform and had never revealed any opinions. This time, after nearly a month of repeated heart-to-heart talks, they truly achieved "knowing everything and saying everything without reservation." Because they had expressed all the words they had suppressed for many years, and the Party Committee immediately made improvements in their work, they truly felt that they had power and responsibility. They became active in their work, examined their own shortcomings, and also found some old professors to study how to improve teaching.

### 个别谈心言无不尽

    个别谈心言无不尽
    本报讯　云南大学在解决人民内部矛盾中，采取个别谈心的办法，取得了显著的效果。
    起初他们也采取座谈会的办法，并且谈出了许多意见，但大家总是看报上揭露到什么程度，他们就揭露到什么程度。云南大学党委研究了这一情况，认识到要大家做到“言无不尽”，除了要注意思想发展的规律而采用和风细雨细水长流的办法外，还必须注意到知识分子的特点和学校的具体情况。知识分子自尊心强，比较爱面子，在会上被批评的人比较难于接受，提意见的人也有许多顾虑，有些问题牵涉的人很广，更为不便；而且在会上还容易冲动，闹成僵局。于是他们就决定除座谈会外，并采取个别谈心的办法；各党员领导干部，知道谁对自己最有意见，就主动的诚诚恳恳的找他谈。在谈心时，除彼此之间的某些误会外，一般都不忙于解释，只抓住正确的意见进行自我批评，并表示决心一定要做知心的朋友。一次谈不完，两次，两次谈不完三次，总要做到言无不尽才止。张其浚副教务长和王士魁教务长，过去由于党委对他们的意见不够尊重，什么事情只是会上征求一下意见，事先没有好好和他们商量，使他们觉得自己是“庙门口的一对石狮子，光摆摆样子”，意见很多。他们搞了五年教学改革，其实他们是不赞成教学改革的，也一直没有露过一点意见。这次经过反反复复将近一个月的谈心，真正的做到了“知无不言，言无不尽”。由于压了多年的话都谈出来了，而且党委也立即在工作上作了改进，使他们真正觉得是有职有权了。他们工作积极起来了，并检查了自己的缺点，还找了一些老教授一道研究如何改进教学。
