New Strategies in American Foreign Aid Policy
Shi Lü

The American foreign aid plan for the 1958 fiscal year, currently under discussion in the U.S. Congress, contains some noteworthy new strategies. These are mainly: First, to transfer military aid to the control of the Department of Defense and include it as part of the U.S. national defense budget. Second, to completely separate military aid from economic aid, incorporating the so-called "defense support" (providing allied countries with food, clothing, and other non-direct military supplies for their armies that have military agreements with the United States), which was originally included in the economic aid category, into military aid. Third, to change economic aid from a primarily grant-based approach to a primarily loan-based approach, focusing on economically underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa; and to shift from the past practice of annual appropriations to establishing a more long-term fund.

What are the purposes of these new strategies?

Let's first briefly describe the background and process of the Eisenhower administration's formulation of this foreign aid plan.
The Crisis of American Foreign Aid Policy

The American ruling class formulated this foreign aid plan in a situation where its foreign aid policy was in a serious crisis. The fundamental factor contributing to this crisis is the trend towards relaxation of the international situation. The aggressive foreign aid policy of U.S. imperialism is predicated on international tension. The more tense the situation, the more likely U.S. imperialism is to use the guise of "common security" to ensnare various capitalist countries into the embrace of American aid, while deceiving the American people into bearing the huge expenses of American aid. As the situation tends to ease, American foreign aid policy becomes increasingly empty. Countries receiving American aid are increasingly considering whether to continue to be tied to the American "common security" chariot. The American people are beginning to doubt the necessity of handing over their hard-earned money to the U.S. government to invest in the bottomless pit of "common security."

At the same time, the aggressive nature and harmfulness of American foreign aid policy have been exposed in many ways. The people of recipient countries have discovered that as a result of accepting American aid, their sovereignty is trampled upon by the United States, their land is requisitioned by the United States for military bases, and their peaceful economic life is disrupted. According to Eisenhower himself, in the past eight years, the United States has provided $17 billion in direct military aid, while during the same period, recipient countries themselves have correspondingly paid $107 billion to engage in arms expansion and war preparation. Such huge military expenditures have deepened the economic difficulties of recipient countries, which in turn makes them more dependent on the United States and more subject to American manipulation.

Precisely because of this, American aid has encountered increasingly strong opposition in recipient countries. The growing call for "trade, not aid" expresses the desire of recipient countries to break free from the shackles of American aid and achieve independence and autonomy. In the process of formulating this American foreign aid plan, with the exception of the groups of Syngman Rhee, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Chiang Kai-shek, who are entirely supported by American bayonets and dollars, many countries have treated the American foreign aid plan with unusual indifference. Although some countries still express their willingness to obtain American aid, most emphasize economic aid and do not want conditions attached. Recently, Britain took the lead in relaxing trade restrictions with China, partly to do more business, but also to begin to break free from the shackles of American aid. The United States finally failed to prevent Britain from relaxing trade restrictions with China, which is a sign of the decline of American foreign aid policy.

The aggressive foreign aid policy of the American ruling class is of no benefit to the American people. From the end of World War II to the end of 1956, the American people had already paid more than $62 billion for various foreign aid programs. However, they saw that this aid did not bring friendship, as the U.S. government had repeatedly told them, but rather a strong anti-American sentiment that developed everywhere. Therefore, more and more Americans are opposing this foreign aid policy. According to a typical survey recently conducted by "U.S. News & World Report," 84%, 78%, and 78% of voters in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, Virginia's 7th Congressional District, and Pennsylvania's 29th Congressional District, respectively, opposed foreign aid policy. Since Eisenhower proposed the 1958 fiscal year budget in January of this year, American public opinion has universally demanded cuts in huge expenditures, and foreign aid appropriations have been regarded as the number one target for cuts. This shows how unpopular foreign aid policy is in the United States.

Measures to Save the Crisis

Faced with the situation described above, the American ruling class, in addition to vigorously publicizing the benefits of foreign aid policy to the United States—actually only to American monopoly capital—has also taken a series of measures to save its precarious foreign aid policy:

First, create a tense situation under the guise of anti-communism to promote the American aid policy accordingly. For example, the tense situation created by the United States in Jordan was cited by Eisenhower in his foreign aid message as a basis for promoting the American aid policy in the Middle East region.

Second, in order to appease the American people's demand for reducing the burden, the initially proposed $4.4 billion foreign aid appropriation was reduced to $3.865 billion to ease the American people's opposition to the foreign aid policy.

Third, launch "investigations and studies." Both the executive and legislative branches have established various investigation committees and published a large number of investigation reports. These reports, on the one hand, try their best to "prove" the "necessity" of continuing to implement the foreign aid policy; on the other hand, they put forward various improvement methods for the method of assistance. Based on these investigations, the government has formulated some of the new strategies mentioned above.

The Purpose of the New Strategies

The purpose of the new strategies is: to continue to focus on military aid, but to hide it within the U.S.'s own defense expenditures, to highlight economic aid in form, and to make it more long-term in nature. This makes it easier to deceive the American people, so that they continue to bear the huge burden of foreign aid, and it also makes it easier to lure other countries into the trap of American aid.

For the American ruling class, military aid is the most beneficial, because it is the fastest, most direct and straightforward way to provide maximum profits to monopoly capitalist groups, and it is also the easiest and most effective way to control recipient countries. Therefore, military aid has always occupied a dominant position in foreign aid plans over the years. In the proposed foreign aid plan, military aid still accounts for more than 72% of the total amount of foreign aid. Eisenhower's proposal to transfer it to the control of the Department of Defense and include it as part of the U.S.'s own defense budget is intended to dilute the negative impression created by military aid and ease popular opposition; at the same time, it is also a disguised way to make military aid long-term and ensure that monopoly capitalist groups benefit from military aid in the long term.

Externally, transferring military aid to the defense budget makes it easier to emphasize the economic nature of the aid. The aggressive nature of this kind of economic aid is much more obscure, and it is easier for some countries to have illusions about it. Because military aid and military-related economic aid have become extremely unpopular in recent years, in order to lure more countries into the trap, the American ruling class clearly believes that it is necessary to "purify" economic aid.

However, economic aid provided in the form of grants with political conditions attached, as has been done so far, is also becoming increasingly unpopular. Therefore, Eisenhower also proposed that economic aid should be mainly in the form of long-term loans, on the one hand to "take care of" the national self-esteem of the people of the recipient countries, and on the other hand to show them a "bright prospect," which will be more tempting to those countries that have strong nationalistic sentiments but are economically underdeveloped. This is also a method of casting a long line to catch big fish; recently Dulles himself said that the so-called economic development loan fund is not "a purely fiscal thing," but America's "indispensable foreign policy tool."

The new strategies proposed by the Eisenhower administration in its foreign aid policy are more hypocritical and cunning in nature, and they may temporarily deceive some people. But these smokescreens cannot conceal the aggressive nature of American foreign aid policy. Without changing this nature, and without adhering to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, no matter how the strategies change, it will always be impossible to escape the crisis of foreign aid policy.

    美国援外政策的新策略
    施旅
    目前正在美国国会讨论中的美国1958财政年度援外计划，包含着一些值得注意的新策略，主要的是：一、把军事援助改交国防部掌握，列为美国本国的国防预算的一部分。二、把军事援助和经济援助截然分开，把原来列入经济援助类内的一项所谓“防御支持”（向同美国订有军事协定的盟国军队提供粮食和服装等非直接军事物资）并入军事援助。三、经济援助从原来的以赠与为主的方式改为以贷款为主的方式，重心放在亚非地区的经济不发达国家；同时从过去逐年拨款的办法改为设立比较长期的基金。
    这些新策略是要达到什么目的呢？
    让我们先来简单叙述一下艾森豪威尔政府这一次援外计划制定的背景和过程。美国援外政策的危机
    美国统治集团是在它的援外政策处于严重危机的情况下制定这一次的援外计划的。促成这一危机的根本因素是国际形势的趋向缓和。美帝国主义的侵略性援外政策是以国际局势紧张为前提的；局势越紧张，美帝国主义就越有可能利用“共同安全”的幌子，使各个资本主义国家投入美援的圈套，同时欺骗美国人民去承担美援的庞大支出。随着局势的趋向缓和，美国援外政策就越来越架空了。接受美援的国家越来越多地考虑是否还要继续被绑在美国的“共同安全”战车上。美国人民开始怀疑把自己的血汗钱交给美国政府去投入“共同安全”的无底洞里究竟有何必要。
    同时，美国援外政策的侵略本质和祸害性已经在许多方面暴露出来。受援国的人民发现，接受美援的结果，主权被美国所蹂躏，土地被美国征为军事基地，和平经济生活遭到了破坏。据艾森豪威尔自己所宣布，在过去八年内，美国提供了一百七十亿美元的直接军事援助，而在同时期内，受援国自己也相应地支付了一千零七十亿美元来从事扩军备战。这样巨大的军费开支加深了受援国的经济困难，转过来又使得它们更加依赖美国，更加受美国的摆布。
    正是因为这样，美援在受援国中遭到了日益强烈的反对。“要贸易不要援助”的呼声日益增长，表达了受援国争取摆脱美援的束缚而独立自主的愿望。在这次美国援外计划制定的过程中，除了李承晚、吴庭艳和蒋介石这些完全靠美国刺刀和美元支撑着的集团之外，许多国家都以异乎寻常的冷淡态度对待美国的援外计划。有些国家虽然仍表示愿意获得美援，却大多强调经济援助，而且不希望附带条件。最近英国带头放宽对华贸易限制，除了想多作生意，也是想为摆脱美援的束缚开端。美国终于未能制止英国放宽对华贸易限制，这是美国援外政策日暮途穷的征兆。
    美国统治集团的侵略性援外政策，对美国人民一无好处。美国人民从第二次世界大战结束以来到1956年底为止，已经为各种援外计划支付了六百二十亿美元以上。然而他们看到，这种援助并没有像美国政府一再告诉他们的那样换来友谊，反而是到处发展起来的强烈反美情绪。因此，美国人民反对这种援外政策的也越来越多。根据“美国新闻与世界报道”最近所作的典型调查，在威斯康星州第一选区、弗吉尼亚州第七选区和宾夕法尼亚州第二十九选区，分别有84％、78％和78％的选民反对援外政策。自从艾森豪威尔在今年1月提出1958财政年度的预算以来，美国舆论普遍要求削减庞大开支，而援外拨款被当作第一号的削减目标。援外政策在美国国内的不得人心，由此可见。
                挽救危机的措施
    面对着以上所说的情况，美国统治集团除了大事宣传援外政策对美国——实际上只是对美国垄断资本——的好处以外，还采取了一系列的措施以挽救岌岌可危的援外政策：
    一、在反共幌子下制造紧张局势，顺势推进美援政策。譬如，美国在约旦所制造的紧张局势，就被艾森豪威尔在他的援外咨文中洋洋得意地引为在中东地区推行美援政策的根据。
    二、为了敷衍美国人民的减轻负担的要求，把最初提出的四十四亿美元的援外拨款，减为三十八亿六千五百万美元，这样来缓和美国人民对援外政策的反对情绪。
    三、发起了“调查研究”。行政当局和立法机构都成立了各式各样的调查委员会，发表了大批调查报告。这些报告一方面竭力“证明”继续执行援外政策的“必要性”；另一方面，对援助的方法提出了各种各样的改进办法。根据这些调查，政府定出了上面提到的一些新策略。
              新策略的目的
    新策略的目的是：继续以军事援助为主，但是却把它隐藏在美国本身的国防费用之内，在形式上把经济援助突出来，并使它带有较为长期的性质。这样既便于蒙蔽美国人民，使他们继续为援外承受巨大负担，又便于引诱其他国家投入美援的陷阱。
    对美国统治集团说来，军事援助好处最大，因为它是向垄断资本集团提供最大限度利润的最迅速、最直接了当的途径，也是对受援国进行控制的最简便、最见效的办法。所以军事援助在历年的援外计划中都占着压倒的地位。在这次提出的援外计划中，军事援助仍占全部援外总额的72％以上。艾森豪威尔提出把它划归国防部掌握，列为美国本国的国防预算的一部分，是想冲淡军事援助所造成的不良印象，缓和人民的反对；同时，这也是变相的使军事援助长期化，保证垄断资本集团长期从军事援助中取得好处。
    对外来说，把军事援助拨归国防预算，便于强调援助的经济性质。这种经济性质的援助，其侵略性质要隐晦得多，较易于使一些国家对之产生幻想。由于几年来军事援助以及军事性的经济援助已经极其不得人心，为了引诱更多国家上钩，美国统治集团显然认为有必要使经济援助“纯洁化”。
    然而，像迄今所作的那样以附有政治条件的赠与方式来提供的经济援助，也已经越来越不吃香。因此，艾森豪威尔又提出经济援助以长期贷款的方式为主，一方面“照顾”受援国人民的民族自尊心，另一方面向他们展示一种“美好远景”，这对于那些有强烈民族主义情绪然而又是经济不发达的国家将具有更大的诱惑力。这也是一种放长线钓大鱼的手法；最近杜勒斯自己就说过，所谓经济发展贷款资金并不是“一种纯粹属于财政性质的东西”，而是美国的“一种必不可少的外交政策工具”。
    艾森豪威尔政府在援外政策上所提出的这些新策略，具有更加伪善和狡猾的性质，它们可能暂时蒙蔽住一些人。但是这些遮眼法并掩盖不了美国援外政策的侵略本质。而不改变这个本质，不以平等互利为原则，无论策略如何变化，总无法摆脱援外政策的危机。
