Xinhua News Agency, 5th June: According to TASS reports, in addition to building giant hydropower stations on major rivers such as the Volga, Angara, and Dnieper, the Soviet Union is currently building a large number of small hydropower stations on small rivers in various regions to serve rural areas.

According to the overall plan for hydropower station construction on various rivers in Ukraine, more than one thousand rural hydropower stations will be built in Ukraine alone in the coming years. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the electricity used in Soviet rural areas will increase twofold.

The prospects for building hydropower stations on small rivers in various parts of the Soviet Union are very broad. According to scientists' statistics, ten thousand rural hydropower stations can be built on various rivers in the Urals, fifty-three thousand in the Altai, and ninety thousand in the Caucasus.

The electricity used in Soviet rural areas is increasing, and the number of electric machines and equipment used in rural areas has reached about four hundred types. Some districts have already established electric machine tractor stations. The "May 1st" State Farm in Stalinino Oblast uses 600,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is equal to half of the total agricultural electricity consumption in Russia before the October Revolution.

Some collective farms are jointly building relatively large hydropower stations. Seventy collective farms in Vinnytsia Oblast are building a hydropower station with a generating capacity of 6,000 kilowatts. A rural hydropower station with a generating capacity of 3,800 kilowatts has been built on the Kuban River, and its electricity can supply nine machine tractor stations, twenty-six collective farms, and three state farms.

    大量满足农村电力需要
    苏联建设大批小型水电站
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联除了在伏尔加、安加拉、第聂伯等大河上建设巨型水电站外，目前还在各地的小河上建设大批为农村服务的小型水电站。
    根据乌克兰各个河流上水电站建设总计划，在今后几年内，单是乌克兰就要建设一千多个农村水电站。在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，苏联农村使用的电力将增加两倍。
    苏联各地小河上建设水电站的前途是很广阔的。根据科学家的统计，在乌拉尔各个河流上可以建设一万个农村水电站，在阿尔泰可以建设五万三千个，在高加索可以建设九万个。
    苏联农村使用的电力越来越多，农村使用的电动机器和设备已经达到四百种左右。有些区已经建立了电动机器拖拉机站。斯大林诺州“五一”国营农场每年用电六十万度，这等于十月革命前整个俄国农业用电的一半。
    有些集体农庄正在合力建设比较大的水电站。文尼萨州的七十个集体农庄正在建设一座发电能力为六千瓩的水电站。库班河上已经建成了一个发电能力为三千八百瓩的农村水电站，它的电力可以供应九个机器拖拉机站、二十六个集体农庄和三个国营农场。
