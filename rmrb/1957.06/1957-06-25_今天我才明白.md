    Today I Finally Understand
  　Zhang Hua
    Zhang Naiqi concludes: "Fixed interest" is not "exploitation."
    What is "fixed interest?" Zhang says: It is "unearned income."
    Then what is "exploitation?" It must be "earned income."
    Today I finally understand that landlords and capitalists are also laborers.
    Chen Guixin concludes: The root of subjectivism and bureaucracy is the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Anyone who has seen the play "Fifteen Strings of Cash" can see that the magistrate of Wuxi County, Guo Yuzhi, is a thorough subjectivist and bureaucrat.
    Today I finally understand that the dictatorship of the proletariat has existed in China since ancient times, and Guo Yuzhi is a Communist.

    今天我才明白

    章乃器断定：“定息”不是“剥削”。
    “定息”是什么？章说：那是“不劳而获”。
    那么“剥削”是什么呢？一定是“劳而获”了。
    今天我才明白，地主和资本家原来也是劳动者。
    陈桂新断定：主观主义、官僚主义的根源是无产阶级专政。
    看过“十五贯”这出戏的人，谁也看得出，无锡县太爷过于执是个地地道道的主观主义和官僚主义者。
    今天我才明白，原来无产阶级专政，在中国是古已有之，而过于执就是个共产党。
