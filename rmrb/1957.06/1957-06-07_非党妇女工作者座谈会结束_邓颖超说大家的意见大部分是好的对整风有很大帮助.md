    The symposium jointly organized by the Women's Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee and the Party Group of the All-China Women's Federation, inviting non-Party Standing Committee members and Executive Committee members of the All-China Women's Federation, heads of women's work in various democratic parties, and heads of group members, concluded yesterday. The meeting was held three times, with a total of eighteen people speaking at the meeting and one person submitting a written statement.
    Before the conclusion of the meeting, Comrade Deng Yingchao, Second Secretary of the Women's Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee, said: Everyone has put forward many opinions, most of which are good and greatly helpful for our rectification and improvement of work. A small number of opinions need to be further studied, analyzed, and considered, and some opinions will be forwarded to relevant departments for research, and some will be left for further exchange of views in the future.
    Laxida, Executive Committee member and Deputy Director of the Welfare Department of the All-China Women's Federation, based on her past experience in Xinjiang, suggested that women's federations at all levels should fully emphasize united front work among ethnic minority women. In the past, the united front departments in Xinjiang mainly targeted men, and many people believed that women did not play a significant role in society and did not need to be targeted for united front work, which is incorrect. In addition, she proposed to resolve the outstanding issues in various social reform movements as soon as possible and to do a good job in uniting upper-class women. She said that the various social reform movements carried out in the Xinjiang region were basically healthy. However, due to the fact that outside cadres did not understand the internal relations and historical characteristics of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and the local cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the various movements, some "leftist" deviations also occurred. Therefore, some people still have doubts and concerns about the government. This should be resolved quickly.
    Lin Qiaozhi, Executive Committee member of the All-China Women's Federation, said in her speech: Painless childbirth is scientifically based. In the past, we were relatively impatient in promoting this method, which resulted in some side effects. But this cannot say that painless childbirth is not good. Any work must be based on facts in order to blossom and bear fruit. Regarding the issue of induced abortion, she said: I am still not convinced what the effect of promoting induced abortion is. She hopes that the Women's Federation can conduct in-depth research on this issue and express its opinions.
    Shen Zijiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, made the following suggestions to the Party Group of the Women's Federation in her speech: First, the leading ideology of the Party Group of the Women's Federation lags behind the objective situation, lacks foresight on some major issues, and is not proactive. For example, the upsurge of socialist transformation has already caused a sensation across the country, and local women's federations have done it automatically, but the All-China Women's Federation has not yet started. Second, the leading ideology of the Party Group of the Women's Federation is overly cautious and somewhat afraid of exposing contradictions. For example, during the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization last spring, many women in various places suffered casualties in labor. When local women's federations reported these situations, we only slowly reported to the Central Committee and made internal notifications. We did not stand on the position of safeguarding the interests of women, boldly expose it, and use the power of public opinion to sound the alarm to rural workers. Shen Zijiu also said: The leadership of the Women's Federation has not paid attention to conducting ideological education on the united front policy among all cadres.
    Cao Mengjun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, raised opinions on the leadership style of the Women's Federation. She said: The leadership of the Women's Federation does not grasp policies and ideology enough. The chairmen and vice-chairmen are busy all day long, dealing with current affairs, and rarely proactively and deeply understand and analyze the situation.
    Cao Mengjun also said: The Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation has basically achieved that there are responsibilities and powers, and has brought into play the enthusiasm of non-Party cadres. Of course, some individual Party members have some sectarianism. In the future, the leadership should boldly let go and allow cadres to work independently. Non-Party cadres should have a sense of ownership, dare to take responsibility, dare to be responsible, and discuss things with the masses more. In this way, it can be achieved that there are responsibilities and powers.
    Jin Xiru, the women's representative of the China Zhi Gong Party, Hu Naiqiu, Yan Renying, and others, who are members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, also spoke at the meeting.

    非党妇女工作者座谈会结束
    邓颖超说大家的意见大部分是好的对整风有很大帮助
    本报讯　中共中央妇女工作委员会和中华全国民主妇联党组邀请全国妇联党外的常委、执委，各民主党派妇女工作的负责人，及团体会员的负责人举行的座谈会于昨日结束。会议一共举行了三次，在会上发言的共十八人，书面发言一人。
    会议结束前，中共中央妇女工作委员会第二书记邓颖超同志说：大家提了很多意见，大部分是好的，对我们整风改进工作有很大帮助，少部分意见要继续研究、分析、考虑，有些意见将分别转交有关部门加以研究，有些留待以后再继续交换意见。
    全国妇联执行委员、福利部副部长拉希达、根据过去她在新疆工作时的感受，提出各级妇联应充分重视在少数民族妇女中进行统战工作。过去，新疆的统战部门的统战对象主要是男人，许多人认为妇女在社会上不起什么作用，不需要对妇女进行统战工作，这是不对的。另外，她提出尽快解决各项社会改革运动中的遗留问题，作好团结上层妇女的工作。她说，新疆地区进行的各项社会改革运动，基本上是健康的。但是，由于外来的干部不了解新疆各民族的内部关系、历史特点，以及当地的干部对各项运动的意义认识不足等原因，也发生了一些“左”的偏差。所以有些人对政府还有怀疑和顾虑。这是应该赶快解决的。
    全国妇联执行委员林巧稚在发言中说：无痛分娩法是有科学根据的。过去我们在推行这个方法时，比较急躁，因而发生了一些副作用。但这不能说无痛分娩法不好。任何工作都要实事求是，才能开花结果。关于人工流产问题，她说：推行人工流产究竟有什么效果，至今还不能说服我。她希望妇联能够在这个问题上深入了解，发表意见。
    全国妇联书记处书记沈兹九在发言中，对妇联党组提出下列意见：第一，妇联党组领导思想落后于客观形势，对一些重大的事情缺乏预见性，不主动。如社会主义改造高潮已经轰动全国，地方妇联在自动做了，全国妇联还没有动手。第二，妇联党组的领导思想上过分谨小慎微，有些骇怕揭露矛盾，如去年春天农业合作化高潮中，不少地方妇女在劳动中，发生了伤亡事故，当地方妇联将这些情况汇报上来的时候，我们只是慢吞吞地向中央打报告和作了内部通报，没有站在维护妇女利益的立场，大胆揭露，并利用舆论的力量向农村工作者敲起警钟。沈兹九还说：妇联领导上没有注意在全体干部中进行统一战线政策的思想教育。
    全国妇联书记处书记曹孟君对妇联领导作风上提出意见。她说：妇联领导上对政策思想抓得不够，主席、副主席成天忙忙碌碌，应付当前事情，主动、深入地了解情况、分析情况很少。
    曹孟君还说：全国妇联书记处基本上做到有职有权，发挥了非党干部的积极性，当然个别党员是有些宗派主义的。今后领导上要大胆放手，让干部独立工作，非党干部应该有主人翁感，要敢于担当，敢于负责，有事多和群众商量，这样，就可以做到有职有权。
    在会上发言的还有中国致公党妇女代表金翕如、全国妇联执行委员胡耐秋、严仁英等人。
