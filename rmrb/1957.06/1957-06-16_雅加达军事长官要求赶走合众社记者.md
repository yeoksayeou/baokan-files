Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 14th – A spokesman for the Jakarta Garrison Command announced today that the Jakarta Military Commander has petitioned the Central Military Commander to expel Russell, a United Press International (UPI) reporter stationed in Indonesia, because this reporter "reported military news in a way that distorted the facts."

Some time ago, local newspapers reported that the UPI reporter had failed to comply with the military authorities' regulations in reporting military news. After being questioned by the Jakarta military authorities, he refused to sign his statement and was therefore detained by the military authorities.

    雅加达军事长官要求赶走合众社记者
    新华社雅加达14日电　雅加达卫戍司令部发言人今天宣布，雅加达军事长官已经呈请中央军事长官把合众社驻印度尼西亚的记者鲁塞尔驱逐出境，因为这个记者“以歪曲事实的方式报道军事消息”。
    前些时候，这里的报纸报道，合众社记者曾经不遵守军事当局的规定，报道军事消息。被雅加达军事当局传询以后，他又拒绝在供状上签字，因此被军事当局扣押。
