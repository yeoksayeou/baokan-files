The Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Reconstruction

Some Basic Figures

To illustrate the reconstruction progress of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the war, some basic figures must be listed.

First, agriculture. From the ceasefire in July 1954 to the end of 1956, over two years, 115,000 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed, accounting for 85% of all farmland in North Vietnam that had been abandoned due to the war. All large-scale water conservancy projects damaged during the war were restored, and eight new large-scale water conservancy projects were built, along with the development of many medium and small-scale irrigation systems. More than 3,000 kilometers of dikes that had been in disrepair for many years were rebuilt within a few months after the war. Rice production increased year by year, even exceeding the highest pre-war level of 1939, fundamentally changing the abnormal situation created by the colonialists where the North relied on the South for food, and basically eliminating the long-standing hunger in rural areas during the lean season.

Next, industry. In the past two years, more than a dozen mines and factories, such as the Hong Gai coal mine, the Hai Phong cement plant, and the Nam Dinh textile factory, have been fully restored. The eighteen factories born in the mountains and forests during the anti-war period have been maintained and expanded. In addition, eighteen new industrial and mining enterprises with modern equipment have been built, seven of which have been completed and put into production, six are about to be completed, and five are under intensive construction. The industrial output value is growing rapidly. In 1955, the profits turned over by state-owned industries accounted for only 4.5% of the total national income, but in 1956, it increased to 27.2%.

Again, private small industry and handicrafts, the achievements in restoring and developing this aspect are also enormous. In 1955, there were more than 51,000 units, and by 1956, it had developed to more than 55,000 units, with 260,000 employees, capable of manufacturing 15,000 kinds of products.

Transportation and domestic and foreign trade have also seen significant restoration and development. The railways, which suffered the most severe war damage, have been repaired for 526 kilometers in the past two years, and the remaining 513 kilometers are still under construction. The original 3,800 kilometers of highways have been restored, and 201 kilometers of new highways have been added. 2,500 kilometers of inland waterways have quickly been opened to navigation. Thousands of kilometers of coastal routes have also been restored. The newly opened civil aviation route between Vietnam and China has strengthened the connection between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the entire socialist camp and other countries. The restoration and development of transportation not only guaranteed the needs of industrial and agricultural reconstruction but also promoted the development of trade. In the past two years, both domestic and foreign trade have shown significant growth. The domestic trade volume increased sevenfold in 1956 compared to 1955. The foreign trade volume increased fourfold in 1955 compared to 1954, and doubled again in 1956 compared to 1955.

Cultural and educational undertakings have also greatly developed. By the end of 1956, the number of hospitals in North Vietnam was four times that during the French colonial rule, the number of clinics had tripled, and the number of medical personnel had increased tenfold. The number of students in North Vietnam has increased several times compared to the highest pre-war year of 1939. At that time, there were an average of 223 students per 10,000 people, while now there are 700 students per 10,000 people, of which the number of university students is about four times that of the entire Indochina university in 1939. In the past two years, another 730,000 people in the North have escaped illiteracy, and more than 90,000 of the 100,000 unemployed people left over from the colonial rule have been employed.

All these figures show one fact: the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made tremendous achievements in reconstruction work in the two years since the war. But it must also be recognized that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has taken such a big step in such a short period of time, it has experienced many difficulties and twists and turns, and some shortcomings and biases have also arisen. But these are, after all, just difficulties and shortcomings in progress.

Achievements and Biases in Land Reform

As soon as the war stopped, the first problem facing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the urgent need to restore and develop agriculture. To restore and develop agriculture, the feudal land system must be completely abolished first, and the productive forces of the countryside must be liberated.

Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government, a large-scale land reform movement gradually expanded from some old liberated areas to the entire rural area of North Vietnam, except for minority areas, and basically ended in the summer of 1956. Through the land reform movement, 7.89 million landless or land-deficient farmers in more than 3,200 villages and more than 10 million farmers in North Vietnam were allocated 690,000 hectares of land, more than 104,000 head of cattle, and more than 1.8 million pieces of agricultural implements. This was a earth-shattering transformation unprecedented in Vietnamese history.

However, due to the particularly complex situation in the newly liberated areas, the land reform movement spread over a wide area in the later period, the progress was very fast, and the strength of the leading backbone was relatively weakened. Therefore, while realizing land reform, some biases also occurred. The more common and major biases were: misclassification of class status, expanding the scope of attack; the assessment of land and the determination of output were too high, harming the interests of middle peasants and even poor and hired peasants; the work of rectifying organizations in combination with land reform experienced an expansionist bias, so that it was used by landlords and bad people; some cadres and backbone members were wrongly struggled against, wrongly judged, and even wrongly punished; this in turn brought negative impact to land reform.

In the spring of 1956, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party had already discovered these errors and biases, and began to take some concrete measures, such as resolutely stopping the work of county-level and provincial-level organizational rectification, and improving the work of rectifying grassroots organizations. In the summer, further measures were taken to correct other errors in the land reform work, such as correcting the class status of wrongly classified people, and preparing to adjust land area and output. The Tenth Enlarged Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, held in the autumn, more clearly affirmed these measures, put forward the slogan of "correcting errors and promoting achievements," and stipulated the guidelines and requirements for correcting errors and biases.

The Tenth Enlarged Session of the Central Committee was a major event in the internal life of the Vietnam Workers' Party. This meeting focused on conducting heated discussions on land reform and organizational rectification, and launched criticism and self-criticism. There was an opinion that the error was the main thing, and the land reform was a failure, thus drawing the negative conclusion that it was not necessary to carry out land reform in Vietnam. Obviously, this opinion was extremely one-sided. Finally, the meeting made a resolution affirming that the Central Committee's land reform guidelines, policies, and lines were fundamentally correct, the achievements of the land reform movement were the main and basic ones, and the errors in land reform belonged to the errors in specific implementation. This estimation was accepted by the Sixth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was held at the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, and became a common understanding of the masses.

Now, even those who had doubts about land reform have to reconsider the decisive and positive impact of land reform on agricultural production in the face of many convincing examples. The most obvious facts are: (1) The rural areas of North Vietnam, which have just suffered 15 years of long-term war damage and have been continuously attacked by various disasters after peace, have not only not suffered crop failures, but have instead achieved three consecutive bumper harvests; (2) The unit area yield in many places has greatly exceeded the highest historical level before the war, and the average unit area yield has increased by 36% compared to before the war; (3) Production enthusiasm in rural areas is generally high, and farmers have shown the greatest enthusiasm for building water conservancy, weeding, accumulating fertilizer, and production investment. In 1956 alone, the medium and small-scale water conservancy projects built by farmers could irrigate 450,000 hectares of paddy fields; (4) Farmers who have been allocated land have a strong desire to organize and improve production. According to preliminary statistics, there are now 190,000 mutual aid teams in North Vietnam, with members accounting for about 58% of all farmers; (5) The purchasing power of rural areas has generally increased, and many goods are in short supply, and even out of stock. For example, the average per capita consumption of cloth in the past was 2.5 meters per year, but now it has increased to 5 to 6 meters. This is an unprecedented new thing.

All the facts eloquently prove a truth: it is impossible to restore and develop agricultural production in North Vietnam without realizing land reform.

Under the premise of affirming the land reform guidelines, policies, lines, and achievements, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government are currently actively and cautiously leading the rural areas to carry out the work of correcting biases in order to eliminate some negative factors and consolidate and promote the achievements of the land reform movement. From the perspective of the entire movement process, correcting biases is essentially solving the legacy problems in land reform. This is a very difficult and very complex task. Feudal landlords and reactionaries once attempted to use this opportunity to launch a counterattack against the peasants, and created chaos in some places. But their conspiracies were quickly discovered and stopped.

Concentrating the opinions of the peasant masses, the Vietnam Workers' Party has repeatedly emphasized that in the work of correcting biases, it is necessary to implement the policy of relying on poor and hired peasants, consolidating and uniting middle peasants, uniting rich peasants, preventing landlords from raising their heads, and giving them a way out for labor reform. Now, the work of correcting biases has entered the second stage, that is, re-assessing land and determining output on the basis of correcting wrongly classified class status. The healthy progress of these works will bring a good influence to the further restoration and development of agricultural production in North Vietnam.

Problems Raised by Industrial Construction

While restoring and developing agriculture, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam must also use great force to carry out the restoration and construction of industry.

To build industry, the first problem facing us is the question of whether to prioritize the development of heavy industry or the development of light industry.

Whether from a theoretical or fundamental interest point of view, Vietnam must prioritize the development of heavy industry; but from the current conditions and urgent needs, it must prioritize the development of light industry. Due to limited funds and technical forces, coupled with unclear resource conditions, and the urgent need for daily necessities by the people, the main construction of various light industries that do not require too much investment, do not require too much engineering, and can be put into production relatively quickly to meet the needs of the people's lives and production, and to accumulate funds and train talents for heavy industry, is the only feasible way for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to carry out industrial construction at present.

In the past two years, according to the policy of prioritizing the development of light industry, the industrial construction in North Vietnam has achieved remarkable results. However, due to the vacillation that occurred in the implementation process, such as investing large amounts of funds in some heavy industries or other large-scale industries that are not urgently needed, take a long time to build, and can be exchanged with brotherly countries, which affected the speed of the entire industrial construction. The Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government have publicly criticized this deviation and have made necessary corrections, reducing some projects and increasing other projects, thus ensuring the sound development of industrial construction.

The second question raised in industrial construction is the question of handicrafts. Due to historical reasons, handicrafts occupy a particularly important position in the entire national economy of Vietnam. Taking last year as an example, the cotton cloth produced by handicrafts totaled more than 30 million meters, accounting for half of the annual cotton cloth output in North Vietnam; and many other daily necessities in rural areas also rely on handicrafts for supply. The various agricultural implements produced by handicrafts last year increased by one time compared to the previous year. Therefore, how to further support handicrafts, making it a long-term and powerful assistant to the emerging industry, is an important issue in Vietnam's economic recovery, especially industrial construction. The Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government inspected this work last winter and believed that there were achievements in supporting handicraft production in the past two years, but there were also shortcomings, such as: insufficient supply of raw materials for some industries, unreasonable purchase prices for some handicrafts, and a lack of overall planning for the development of the entire handicraft industry, etc., and the fundamental reason was insufficient understanding of the importance of handicrafts. Clarifying these issues will help the further development and prosperity of handicrafts.

The third question is the question of supporting and transforming private enterprises. Although the scale of private enterprises in North Vietnam is not very large and the capital is not very strong, it will still play a considerable role in the economy for a relatively long time in the present and future. In the past two years, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government have adopted methods such as processing, ordering, contracting production, and contracting sales to support and transform private enterprises, making it serve the entire reconstruction work. Good results have been achieved in this regard. However, there are still some problems in the work, such as: the specifications for some products are set too high, while the purchase prices for other products are set too low, and there have been some shortcomings in the control of raw material supply and the tax system. After the inspection last winter, there have been improvements.

Finally, the issue of technical strength is one of the most acute problems in Vietnam's industrial construction. The nearly 100 years of reactionary rule by the French colonialists in Vietnam left behind a dilapidated industrial scene, and the most serious thing was that it hindered the growth of Vietnam's technical strength. During the colonial rule, it was not only difficult to find a Vietnamese senior engineering technician in factories and mines, but even skilled technicians were very few. Therefore, when starting to restore and build industry, how to quickly cultivate technical strength has become the most urgent task at present. In the past two years, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government have taken many effective measures to solve this problem, such as: selecting students to study abroad and establishing industrial universities to train senior engineering technicians; opening secondary technical schools to train intermediate technicians; opening amateur technical training classes to improve the technology of workers and cadres in service to reach the level of skilled technicians; and equipping a complete set of personnel according to the needs of a certain industrial and mining enterprise to study in the Soviet Union, China, and other brotherly countries, or to study while building in their own country. Vietnam's technical strength is gradually growing under such circumstances.

Forward, Forward Again

After the Western colonialists' attempt to crush the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with war failed, they dreamed that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would be overwhelmed by economic difficulties. But they were wrong. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic government, the Vietnamese people have basically restored the economy of North Vietnam in the short two years after the war, laying a solid foundation for further development and construction. Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, once said at a recent meeting: The liberated Vietnamese people are never satisfied with the existing achievements. They must continue to move forward on the basis of the existing achievements and strive to complete the restoration of the national economy in 1957 in order to enter the stage of planned construction as soon as possible.

    越南民主共和国在恢复建设中
    展潮
    一些基本数目字
    要说明越南民主共和国在战后进行恢复建设的情况，得列举一些基本数字。
    首先是农业。自1954年7月停战到1956年底止，在两年多的时间里，已经开垦了十一万五千公顷荒地，占越南北方因为战争荒芜了的全部田地85％；在战争中遭到破坏的大型水利工程全部恢复，而且还新建了八个大型水利工程和发展了许多中、小型灌溉系统；长达三千多公里的失修多年的堤坝，在战后几个月就重新修筑好了；稻米的产量逐年上升，甚至已经超过战前最高年度1939年的水平，从根本上改变了殖民者造成的北方长期依赖南方粮食的畸形现象，基本上消除了农村长久以来在青黄不接时期的饥饿状况。
    其次谈到工业。在过去两年中，已经全部恢复鸿基煤矿、海防水泥厂、南定纺织厂等十几个矿山和工厂，维持和扩建抗战时期在山林里诞生的十八个工厂，此外还修建了十八个新的具有近代化设备的工矿企业，其中七个已经竣工投入生产，六个即将完成，五个正加紧建设中。工业产值正在飞速地增长，1955年国营工业上缴利润只占国家总收入的4.5％，1956年即增加到27.2％。
    再次是私营小工业和手工业，这方面恢复发展的成绩也是巨大的。1955年共有五万一千多个单位，到1956年已经发展到五万五千多个单位，从业者达到二十六万人，可以制造一万五千种产品。
    交通运输和内外贸易也有重大的恢复和发展。过去遭受战争摧残最为严重的铁路，两年多来，已经修复了五百二十六公里，其余五百一十三公里正继续修建中；原有三千八百公里的公路已经恢复，而且还增修了二百零一公里的新公路；二千五百公里的内河航线很快就通航了；上千公里的沿海航线也得到了恢复；而新开辟的越中两国民用航空线，使得越南民主共和国和整个社会主义阵营以及其他国家的联系加强了。由于交通运输的恢复和发展，一方面保证了工农业恢复建设的需要，另一方面也促进了贸易的开展。两年多来，不论是对内或对外贸易都有显著的增长。国内贸易额，1956年比1955年增加了七倍；对外贸易额，1955年比1954年增加四倍，1956年又比1955年增加二倍。
    文化教育事业也有很大的发展。到1956年底止，越南北方的医院为法国殖民者统治时期的四倍，门诊所增加了三倍，医务人员增加了十倍；越南北方的学生人数比战前最高年度1939年增加几倍，那时候每万人中平均有二百二十三名学生，而现在每万人中却有了七百名学生，其中大学生约等于1939年整个印度支那大学生的四倍；两年来，北方又有七十三万人脱离了文盲状态，此外殖民统治时期留下的十万多失业者已经有九万多人就业。
    以上这些数目字都表明一个事实：越南民主共和国在战后两年多来，在恢复建设工作中，已经取得了巨大的成就。但是同时也必须看到这样的事实：越南民主共和国在这样短促的时间里迈进如此大的一步，是经历了许多困难和周折的，而且还产生了一些缺点和一些偏向。但是这毕竟只是前进中的困难和缺点。
    土地改革的成绩和偏向
    战争一停下来，摆在越南民主共和国面前的头一个问题，就是急需恢复和发展农业。要恢复和发展农业，首先就必须彻底废除封建土地制度，解放农村的生产力。
    在越南劳动党和民主共和国政府的领导下，一个规模宏大的土地改革运动，便由部分老解放区逐渐扩展到除了少数民族地区外的整个北方的农村，到1956年夏天基本上宣告结束。经过了土地改革运动，越南北方三千二百多个乡、一千多万农民里面，就有七百八十九万无地或缺地的农民分得了六十九万公顷土地、十万四千多头耕牛和一百八十多万件农具，这是越南历史上从来没有过的、翻天复地的大变革。
    但是由于新解放区情况特别复杂，后期土地改革运动铺展的面很宽，进度又很快，而领导骨干的力量又相对地减弱了，因此在实现土地改革的同时，也发生了一些偏向。比较普遍和主要的偏向是：错划成分，扩大了打击面；评田定产偏高，损害了中农甚至贫雇农的利益；和土地改革结合进行的整顿组织工作发生过扩大化偏向，以致被地主和坏人利用；错斗、错判甚至错误处分了些干部和骨干分子；这样反过来也给土地改革带来了消极的影响。
    1956年春天，越南劳动党中央政治局就已经发现了这些错误偏向，并且开始采取一些具体措施，例如坚决停止县级和省级整顿组织的工作，改善整顿基层组织的工作；夏天又采取了进一步的措施纠正土地改革工作中的其他错误，例如改正错划的人的成分，准备调整土地面积产量等；秋天举行的第十次越南劳动党中央委员会扩大会议，更明确地肯定了这些措施，提出了“纠正错误，发扬成绩”的口号，并规定了纠正错误偏向的方针和要求。
    第十次中央委员会扩大会议，是越南劳动党内生活中的一件大事。这次会议集中地对土地改革和整顿组织工作进行了热烈的讨论，并且展开了批评和自我批评。曾经有一种意见，认为错误是主要的，土地改革是失败了的，从而得出了在越南不必进行土地改革的否定的结论，显然这种意见带有极大的片面性。最后，会议作出了决议，肯定党中央土地改革的方针政策路线根本上是正确的，土地改革运动的成绩是主要的和基本的，土地改革中的错误是属于具体实施时的错误。这种估计，又为后来在1956年末到1957年初召开的越南民主共和国国会第六次会议所接受，变成广大群众共同的认识。
    现在，即使是对土地改革有过怀疑的人，面对着许多令人信服的例证，都不得不重新考虑土地改革给农业生产所带来具有决定意义的、积极的影响了。最明显不过的是下面这样一些事实：（一）刚经受了十五年长期战争的破坏，和平后又接连不断地遭到各种灾害的袭击，越南北方农村不但不是歉收，相反地却连续获得三次丰收；（二）许多地方的单位面积产量都大大地超过了战前历史上最高的水平，而平均单位面积产量比战前增加了36％；（三）农村生产情绪普遍高涨，农民对于兴修水利、除草、积肥和生产投资，表现出最大的热情。1956年间，仅是农民修建的中、小型水利工程，就可以灌溉四十五万公顷稻田；（四）农民分得了土地，要求组织起来提高生产的劲头很大，据初步统计，越南北方现在共有十九万个变工组，组员约占全部农民的58％；（五）农村购买力普遍提高，许多货物供不应求，甚至发生脱销现象，例如布匹，过去每年每人平均消费二点五公尺，现在却提高到五至六公尺。这是从来没有过的新事。
    所有的事实都雄辩地证明着一个道理：如果不实现土地改革的话，要想恢复和发展越南北方的农业生产是不可能的。
    越南劳动党和民主共和国政府在肯定土地改革的方针、政策、路线和成绩的前提下，目前正积极地、慎重地领导着农村进行纠正偏向的工作，以便清除一些消极的因素，巩固和发扬土地改革运动的成果。要是从整个运动过程来看，纠正偏向实质上是解决土地改革中的遗留问题。这是一项十分艰巨、十分复杂的任务。封建地主和反动分子曾经企图利用这个机会向农民进行反攻，并且在某些地方造成了混乱现象。但是他们的阴谋活动很快就被发现和制止了。
    集中了农民群众的意见，越南劳动党一再强调在纠偏工作中，必须贯彻依靠贫雇农、巩固地团结中农、联合富农、防止地主抬头并给予劳动改造出路的方针。现在，纠偏工作已经进入第二阶段，即在改正错划成分的基础上重新评田定产。这些工作能够健康地进行下去，将会对越南北方农业生产进一步的恢复和发展带来良好的影响。
    工业建设所提出的问题
    在恢复和发展农业的同时，越南民主共和国还要以巨大的力量来进行工业的恢复和建设工作。
    要建设工业，首先面临的一个问题，就是优先发展重工业还是优先发展轻工业的问题。
    无论是从理论上或是从根本利益来考虑，越南都必须优先发展重工业；但是从当前的条件和迫切的需要来看，却必须优先发展轻工业。由于资金和技术力量有限，再加上对资源情况不明，而人民群众又急需日用必需品，因此主要建设一些投资不太多、工程量不太大、比较快就能投入生产的各种轻工业，以解决人民群众生活和生产的需要，为重工业积累资金及培养人才，是越南民主共和国当前在进行工业建设中唯一可行的途径。
    两年多来，按照优先发展轻工业的方针，越南北方的工业建设已经取得了显著的成绩。但是由于在执行过程中曾经发生过摇摆现象，例如把大量的资金投到某些不太急需的、建设时间很长而又能和兄弟国家交换的重工业或者别的大型工业上去，致使影响整个工业建设的速度。对于这种偏差，越南劳动党和民主共和国政府曾经作了公开的批判，并且已经进行了必要的改正，削减了一些工程项目，增加了另外一些工程项目，这样就保证了工业建设健全的发展。
    在工业建设中所提出来的第二个问题，就是关于手工业的问题。由于历史上的原因，手工业在越南整个国民经济中占有特殊重要的地位。就以去年来说，手工业生产的棉布共达三千多万公尺，占越南北方全年棉布产量的一半；而农村其他许多日用品也都是依靠手工业供给，去年手工业生产的各式农具比前年增加了一倍。因此如何进一步扶助手工业，使它成为新兴工业的长期和有力的助手，是越南恢复经济、特别是工业建设中一个重要的课题。越南劳动党和民主共和国政府去年冬天曾经检查了这方面的工作，认为两年来扶助手工业生产是有成绩的，但是也存在着缺点，例如：对某些行业原料供应不足，对有些手工业品所规定的收购价格不合理，对整个手工业的发展缺乏通盘的计划等等，而根本的原因在于对手工业的重要性认识不足。明确了这些问题，将有助于手工业进一步的发展和繁荣。
    第三个问题，就是关于私营企业的扶持和改造问题。虽然越南北方私营企业规模都不太大，资金也不算雄厚，但是在目前以及今后一个较长的时间里，它仍然要在经济上起着相当重要的作用。两年多来，越南劳动党和民主共和国政府对于私营企业，曾经采取加工、定货、包产、包销等办法予以扶持和改造，使它为整个恢复建设工作服务。这一方面已经取得了很好的成绩。但是在工作中也还存在一些问题，例如：对某些产品规格订得偏高，对另外一些产品收购价格又订得偏低，在原料供应和税收制度的掌握上都曾经有过一些缺点，经过去年冬天的检查，已经有了改进。
    最后，技术力量问题，是越南工业建设中一个最尖锐的问题。法国殖民者在越南近百年的反动统治，遗留下来的是一个破烂的工业摊子，而最为严重的是它阻碍了越南技术力量的生长。在殖民者统治时期，工厂矿山里不仅很难找到一个越南自己的高级工程技术人员，甚至连熟练的技术工人也是微乎其微的。因此，在着手进行恢复建设工业的时候，如何迅速培养技术力量，便成为当前一个最迫切的任务了。两年来，越南劳动党和民主共和国政府采取了不少有效的措施来解决这个问题，例如：选派留学生和设立工业大学，培养高级工程技术人员；开办中等技术学校，培养中级技术人员；开办业余技术训练班，提高在职工人和干部的技术，以达到熟练技术工人的水平；按照某一个工矿企业的需要配备全套人员，到苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家进行学习，或者就在本国一边建设一边学习。越南人民的技术力量，就在这种情况下逐渐地生长起来。
    前进，再前进
    西方殖民主义者企图用战争摧垮越南民主共和国的阴谋失败之后，他们便梦想越南民主共和国会被经济困难所压倒。可是他们落空了。越南人民在越南劳动党和民主共和国政府领导下，在战后短短的两年中，已经基本上恢复了越南北方的经济，为进一步发展建设奠定了稳固的基础。越南民主共和国政府总理范文同在不久前召开的一次会议上曾经说过：解放了的越南人民绝不满足已有的成绩，他们要在已有成绩的基础上继续前进，要争取在1957年完成国民经济的恢复工作，以便早日进入计划建设阶段。
