Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The State Council held its fifty-first plenary session today. After hearing reports from Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, on the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and from Chen Zaili, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the session discussed and decided to establish the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. These two decisions will be submitted to the upcoming Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress for deliberation and approval.

Wang Feng said in his report that the proposal to establish a Hui Autonomous Region in northeastern Gansu was initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in February 1956. The CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the Gansu Provincial People's Committee began deliberations and discussions among more than 4,700 Party and non-Party cadres in May of the same year. The vast majority of comrades who participated in the deliberations and discussions supported the Central Committee's proposal to establish a Hui Autonomous Region in the Gansu area. They believed that the Hui people have a population of more than 3.5 million nationwide (according to the 1953 population census), and are one of the larger minority nationalities. If the Hui people do not establish an autonomous area at the provincial level, it would not be commensurate with their status in the big family of the motherland. Nearly 1.2 million of China's Hui people live in Gansu Province, and establishing a Hui Autonomous Region in northeastern Gansu is the most appropriate given the dispersed distribution of the Hui population throughout the country.

Wang Feng said that the scope of the Hui Autonomous Region is based on the Ningxia area (excluding Mongolian areas), which was originally incorporated into Gansu Province, and includes adjacent areas. Specifically, it includes Yinchuan City, Helan County, Yongning County, Ningshuo County, Pingluo County, Huinong County, Zhongwei County, Zhongning County, and Taole County in the Yinchuan Special Area of present-day Gansu; Guyuan County, Xiji County, and Haiyuan County in the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture; Wuzhong City, Jinji County, Lingwu County, Tongxin County, and Yanchi County in the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture; and Longde County and Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County in the Pingliang Special Area, totaling seventeen counties and two cities. The total area of the region is approximately 77,800 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 1,728,000, of which the Hui people account for more than one-third.

Wang Feng said that the region has good conditions for economic development: In agriculture, Yinchuan and Wuzhong are basins with more than 3 million mu of paddy fields. After the Qingtongxia Dam is completed, the irrigated area can be expanded by millions of mu. In addition, the region has vast grasslands and pastures, which can greatly develop animal husbandry. The nationally renowned Tan sheepskin is produced here. The Shizuishan Coal Mine in Yinchuan has large reserves, which can supply industrial coal for the Gansu region in the future. According to geological surveys, the autonomous region may also contain oil mines. Therefore, the conditions for establishing new industrial enterprises in the future are also available. In terms of transportation, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will be completed next year. In the future, the railway from Xianyang, Shaanxi, to Wuwei, Gansu, is also planned to connect in Zhongwei County and pass through Guyuan County. If this happens, the autonomous region's transportation will be very convenient.

Chen Zaili said in his report that Guangxi Province has a total population of more than 18 million, of which more than 6.5 million are Zhuang people and nearly 900,000 are other minority nationalities. The Zhuang people mainly live in 42 counties in the western and central parts of the province. In December 1952, in order to implement the Party's ethnic policies, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, equivalent to an administrative office, was established under the direct leadership of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government. After the promulgation of the Constitution, it was changed to the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in February 1956. In this ethnic autonomous area, a lot of work has been done in ethnic unity and in the political, economic, and cultural fields. It has completed the historical tasks of land reform and agricultural cooperation and has trained nearly 50,000 ethnic minority cadres. However, the Zhuang people are the most populous minority nationality in China, and the areas where they live are also very concentrated. An autonomous area at the prefecture level is obviously not commensurate with its position in China's national family. Based on these circumstances and the Party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed last October to establish a Zhuang Autonomous Region at the provincial level, which is completely correct and fully conforms to the wishes of the Zhuang people and the interests of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi.

He said that from last October to now, extensive deliberations on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been carried out in the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the democratic parties in Guangxi Province, and people's organizations. From April to May of this year, people's congresses were generally convened in cities and counties to formally discuss the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region.

He said that there were two options for establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region: separation and integration. After repeated discussions and weighing the pros and cons from all aspects, a consensus was reached that the integration option should be adopted. Everyone believes that the history and culture of Guangxi were created by the common struggle of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi. At the same time, they realized from real life that they are also inseparable in terms of economic interests. The Zhuang area has a small population, more land, a wider forest area, rich native products, and great potential for developing a diversified economy, with great prospects. However, the level of culture and technology is relatively low. Conversely, the Han area has a large population, less land, a more developed economy, and a higher level of culture and technology. As for underground resources, although the Han area has been developed more, preliminary exploration shows that the Zhuang area also has abundant reserves. In the past, the people of all nationalities in Guangxi deeply realized in their long-term common life that everyone should only unite and not separate. Today, they should further uphold the spirit of mutual assistance and common development, learn from each other's strengths, and work together to mobilize all positive factors of human and material resources to strengthen socialist economic construction. Now, the Zhuang people are not only eager to establish an autonomous area equivalent to a province, but also sincerely welcome the help of the Han people. The Han people treat the Zhuang people with an equal attitude and support the demands of the Zhuang people with cooperative and friendly feelings, fully demonstrating the fraternal love and unity of the brotherly nationalities.

Chen Zaili finally said that the deliberation work on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region shows that the people of all nationalities and all walks of life are very concerned about this issue, the attitude of the discussion is serious, and basically consistent opinions have been reached on several major issues. Guangxi Province is preparing to convene a people's congress in every township throughout the province to conduct discussions and further carry out this work as a major political task for the province.

People from all nationalities and all walks of life from the Gansu Provincial Delegation and the Guangxi Provincial Delegation who attended the plenary session as observers spoke in the discussion. They all agreed to the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The meeting also approved the State Council's proposal to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on appropriately increasing the private plots of members of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Finally, the meeting approved appointments and removals.

### 国务院第五十一次全体会议作出决定  建立宁夏回族和广西僮族两自治区

    国务院第五十一次全体会议作出决定
    建立宁夏回族和广西僮族两自治区
    新华社7日讯　今天举行的国务院全体会议第五十一次会议，在听取了民族事务委员会副主任汪锋所作的关于建立宁夏回族自治区的报告和广西省副省长陈再励所作的关于成立广西僮族自治区的报告以后，讨论并且决定成立宁夏回族自治区和成立广西僮族自治区。这两个决定将提请不久即将举行的第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议审议批准。
    汪锋在报告中说，关于在甘肃东北部建立回族自治区的问题，是中共中央1956年2月倡议的。中共甘肃省委和甘肃省人民委员会，从同年5月开始即先后在四千七百多名党内外干部中进行了酝酿和讨论。参加酝酿和讨论的同志，绝大多数对于中央倡议在甘肃地区建立回族自治区是拥护的，认为在全国回族人口有三百五十多万（根据1953年人口调查统计），是少数民族人口比较多的一个民族，如果回族不建立一个省一级的自治地方，是不能够同它在祖国大家庭的地位相适应的；而我国的回族，居住在甘肃境内的就将近一百二十万人，在全国回族居住分散的情况下在甘肃东北部建立回族自治区是最合适的。
    汪锋说，回族自治区的区划范围，从原来并入甘肃省的宁夏地区（蒙古族地区除外）为基础再划入临近的地区，即包括现在甘肃银川专区的银川市、贺兰县、永宁县、宁朔县、平罗县、惠农县、中卫县、中宁县、陶乐县；固原回族自治州的固原县、西吉县、海原县；吴忠回族自治州的吴忠市、金积县、灵武县、同心县、盐池县；平凉专区的隆德县、泾源回族自治县，共十七个县和两个市。全区面积约有七万七千八百多平方公里，人口约有一百七十二万八千多人，其中回族占三分之一以上。
    汪锋说，这个地区的经济发展有良好的条件：在农业方面，银川、吴忠是个盆地，现在即有水田三百余万亩，如果青铜峡水坝建成后，还可扩大灌溉面积几百万亩，另外，这个地区有广阔的草山和草场，可以大量发展畜牧业经济，全国闻名的滩羊皮就出产在这里；银川的石嘴山煤矿蕴藏量很大，将来可以供应甘肃地区的工业用煤；根据地质部门勘探的材料，自治区内还可能藏有石油矿，因此，将来兴办一些新的工业企业的条件也是具备的。在交通方面，包兰铁路明年即将修通，将来从陕西咸阳到甘肃武威的铁路，也计划在中卫县接轨，并且通过固原县，如果这样，自治区的交通是很方便的。
    陈再励在报告中说：广西省人口共一千八百多万，其中僮族六百五十多万人，其他少数民族近九十万人。僮族主要聚居在省内西部和中部地区的四十二个县。1952年12月，为了贯彻党的民族政策，建立了相当行署一级的桂西僮族自治区，属广西省人民政府直接领导。宪法公布后，1956年2月改为桂西僮族自治州。在这个民族自治地方，对民族团结以及政治、经济、文化方面做了不少工作，已经完成了土地改革和农业合作化的历史任务，并且培养了近五万的民族干部。但是，僮族是我国少数民族人口最多的一个民族，居住地区也很集中，自治州一级的自治地方，显然是和它在我国民族大家庭中的地位不相称的。中共中央根据这些情况和党的民族区域自治政策，于去年10月倡议建立省一级的僮族自治区，是完全正确的，是完全符合僮族人民的愿望，同样符合广西各民族人民利益的。
    他说，去年10月到现在，在政协广西省委员会、广西省各民主党派、人民团体中广泛地进行了关于建立广西僮族自治区问题的酝酿工作。今年4月至5月，各市、县普遍地召开了人民代表大会，正式讨论了关于建立僮族自治区问题。
    他说建立僮族自治区本有分、合两个方案。经过大家反复讨论后，从各方面权衡利弊得失后，取得一致的看法，认为应该采取合的方案。大家认为广西的历史与文化是广西各民族人民共同奋斗创造的。同时，他们从现实生活中，又体会到在经济利益上，也是不可分割的。僮族地区，人口少，土地较多，森林面积较广，土特产丰富，生产潜力大，又可发展多种经济，前途大有可为。但文化、技术水平则较低。反之，汉族地区，人口多，土地较少，目前经济较发展，文化技术水平较高。至于地下蕴藏，汉族地区目前虽开发较多，据初步勘探了解僮族地区蕴藏亦不少。过去，广西各民族人民在长期的共同生活体会中，深切地认识到大家只宜合，不宜分，今天，更应本互相帮助，共同发展的精神，取长补短，共同努力，调动一切人力、物力的积极因素，以加强社会主义的经济建设。现在僮族人民一方面迫切要求建立相当省一级的自治地方，另一方面又诚心地欢迎汉族帮助。汉族人民则用平等态度对待僮族人民，用合作友爱感情支持僮族的要求，充分体现了兄弟民族的友爱，团结。
    陈再励最后说，关于成立广西僮族自治区的酝酿工作，从这半年来的讨论情况看，说明了各族各界人民对这一问题是很关心的，讨论的态度是认真的，对于几个重大问题，已经基本上取得了一致的意见。广西省准备在全省各乡普遍地召开一次乡人民代表大会进行讨论，把进一步开展此项工作，作为全省当前一项重大的政治任务来完成。
    列席这次全体会议的甘肃省代表团和广西省代表团的各族各界人士在讨论中发了言。他们都同意成立宁夏回族自治区和同意成立广西僮族自治区。
    会议还通过了国务院关于适当增加农业生产合作社社员自留地问题向全国人民代表大会常务委员会的提案。
    会议最后通过了任免事项。
