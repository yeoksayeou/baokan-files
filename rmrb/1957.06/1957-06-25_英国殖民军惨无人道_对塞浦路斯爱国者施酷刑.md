　　British Colonial Army's Inhuman Torture of Cypriot Patriots

Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd Dispatch from Athens. The Greek radio station broadcast that the British troops stationed in Cyprus recently buried thirty-six Cypriot patriots up to their necks, leaving only their heads exposed, and then pulled out their hair and beards as a form of torture during interrogation.

British Labour Party MPs Brockway and Jennie Lee issued statements on June 22, proving that Cypriot patriots suffered beatings, insults and torture in British prisons on the island of Cyprus. The two MPs have already raised questions in the House of Commons to Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd, requesting an investigation into the situation of prisoners in British prisons in Cyprus.

　　英国殖民军惨无人道
    对塞浦路斯爱国者施酷刑
    据新华社23日讯　希腊电台广播，驻在塞浦路斯的英国军队最近将三十六名塞浦路斯爱国者全身埋在地下，只露出头部，然后拔去头发和胡须，作为审讯时的一种酷刑。
    英国工党议员布罗克威和珍尼·李在6月22日发表了谈话，证明在塞浦路斯岛英国监狱里塞浦路斯爱国者遭受毒打、侮辱和拷问。这两位议员已经在下院向殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德提出质询，要求对塞浦路斯英国监狱中囚徒处境进行调查。
