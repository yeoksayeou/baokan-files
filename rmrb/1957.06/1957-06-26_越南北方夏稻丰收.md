However, the weather was better this year than last year, and the harvest was more timely, without losses due to floods. The Third Interzone is the area with the most rice paddies in the North, and the yield of early rice in most of this area has increased compared to last year. In Ha Nam Province, early rice production this year increased by 15% to 20% compared to last year, with an average yield of 1,700 to 1,800 kilograms per hectare, and the highest yield reaching 3,300 kilograms.
