Xinhua News Agency, June 1st - According to TASS, Soviet University Professor Kazansky recently stated that, based on the latest materials, it can be confirmed that the ancient Greek poet Homer did exist, although his name may not be accurate. The Greek epics "Odyssey" and "Iliad" are indeed Homer's works.

Professor Kazansky gave a positive answer in his report on the complex question of whether Homer existed at all, at the classical philology representative meeting held at Leningrad University. Previously, some people said that there was no Homer at all, while others said that there was such a person, and that he was blind.

The Classical Philology Representative Meeting was held for the first time in the Soviet Union. The task of the meeting was to exchange the experiences of Soviet experts in this field and to summarize the research work on ancient Greece and Rome.

Kazansky also said that recently excavated cultural relics, works of art, and original literary works have enriched science. The important achievements of excavations in Troy, Pylos, Mycenae, Cyprus, and Asia Minor, as well as archaeological work in the Soviet Black Sea region, should be attributed in many ways to new concepts about Greece. Now the history of Greece has been traced back almost a thousand years further. The fact that the ancient Greeks established contacts with Palestine, Babylon, the Hittite Empire, the Kingdom of Phrygia, the Assyrian Empire, and Egypt is particularly important.

    荷马确有其人
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联大学教授卡赞斯基最近说，根据最新的材料，可以肯定古希腊诗人荷马确有其人，虽然他的名字可能不确实；希腊史诗“奥德赛”和“伊利亚德”正是荷马的作品。
    卡赞斯基教授在列宁格勒大学举行的古典语言学代表会议上就究竟有没有荷马这个人的复杂问题作的报告中作了肯定的答复。在此以前有人说根本没有荷马这个人，也有人说有这个人，并且是个盲人。
    古典语言学代表会议在苏联还是第一次举行。会议的任务是要交流苏联在这一方面工作的专家的经验，对古希腊和罗马的研究工作进行总结。
    卡赞斯基还说，近来发掘出来的文物、艺术作品和文学原著丰富了科学。在特罗伊、皮洛斯、米肯内、塞浦路斯和小亚细亚等地的发掘工作以及在苏联黑海地区所进行的考古工作的重要成就，应当在种种方面归功于有关希腊的新的概念。现在希腊的历史几乎又向前追溯了近一千年。古希腊人同巴勒斯坦、巴比伦、赫梯帝国，同弗里基亚王国、亚述帝国、埃及建立联系这一事实是特别重要的。
