　　An Unusual Spring

　　The spring of 1957 was an unusual time for China's political and intellectual circles.

　　On February 27th, Chairman Mao delivered a speech at the Supreme State Conference "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Although this speech has only now been published, its content has already been circulated among people from all walks of life. This speech, based on Marxist dialectics, clarified a series of fundamental issues facing our country after the basic completion of the socialist revolution in terms of ownership. It will undoubtedly have a profound and lasting impact on raising the consciousness of the Chinese people, consolidating the unity of the Chinese people, and promoting the healthy development of China's socialist cause. Let us not speak of the distant future, but only observe the short period from the end of February to mid-June, and we can already see the power of the principles it put forward.

　　Due to the systematic presentation of the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, due to the thorough explanation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and due to the launch of the Party's rectification movement on this basis, China's political life has been particularly active in the past period. On the one hand, the people put forward a large number of positive criticisms and suggestions for the work of the Party and the government, prompting the Party and the government to actively take steps to improve their work and strengthen their ties with the people. On the other hand, certain bourgeois right-wing elements who were dissatisfied with the socialist cause also tried their best to use the slogans put forward by the Party to expand their influence and strive for their position. The development of more than three months was faster than three years under normal circumstances; the lessons given to people in more than three months were richer than three years under normal circumstances.

　　If the masses had opinions but could not speak freely, how could the Party and the government have discovered and overcome their shortcomings so quickly? Similarly, if people's erroneous or even reactionary ideas did not have the opportunity to be fully expressed, how could the masses have been so clearly able to recognize their faces, how could they have risen up to correct them and criticize them?

　　Various people reacted differently to the policy put forward by Chairman Mao on behalf of the Party Central Committee. The broad masses of the people warmly supported this policy because it supported the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in the socialist cause, and strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses. The politically far-sighted backbone elements of the Party who are connected to the masses resolutely implemented this policy, understanding that this policy would greatly promote the improvement of the Party's work, ensure that the Party took the real initiative, and ensure the Party's unity with the majority of the masses. However, some people within the Party once doubted or even opposed this policy, fearing that it would cause chaos, or because they were infected with relatively strong bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist habits, and feared being attacked by the masses. This part of the people fell behind the movement of objective things, and only by relying on the Party's education to correct their erroneous views could they keep up with the pace of history.

　　The bourgeois right-wing elements were another situation. They were unwilling to see China embark on the socialist road. The Hungarian incident strengthened their imagination: a country that had already established a socialist foundation in terms of ownership could still be overthrown and degenerate. Contrary to the people, they not only did not regard Chairman Mao's speech as a weapon for consolidating the socialist system, but also indulged in fantasy, thinking that they could use it as a tool to weaken the socialist system. In order to weaken the socialist system, their first step was to weaken the Communist Party's leadership over the work of the state. Therefore, they demanded joint leadership, or demanded that the Communist Party withdraw from leadership in certain areas. They tried their best to interpret the slogans of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence, and mutual supervision to suit their purposes, and actively collected their supporters among democratic parties, intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, and young students. In May, the Communist Party began rectification, and also asked non-Party members to help the Party's rectification. They thought their opportunity had come. In the name of helping the Party's rectification, they not only exaggerated the shortcomings and errors in the Party's work, creating an atmosphere where only shortcomings and errors were allowed to be mentioned and no advantages or achievements were allowed to be mentioned, but also described bureaucracy as a product and synonym of socialism, sectarianism as a product and synonym of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and subjectivism and dogmatism as products and synonyms of Marxism, and launched a rampant attack on the socialist system and the Party's leadership. The Party, according to the principle that the masses' revolutionary consciousness should be cultivated in the wind and rain of struggle and not in a greenhouse (this principle was repeatedly announced in Chairman Mao's speech), decided not to give a counterattack for the time being, so that the masses could fully recognize their faces in order to increase their knowledge and learn lessons. This made their heads even hotter. In their view, it was simply that everywhere was against the Party! It was simply the eve of the Hungarian incident! It was simply necessary to invite them out to save the situation or clean up the mess!

　　What was the result?

　　Contrary to the expectations of the fearful, and also contrary to the expectations of the happy, the world did not fall into chaos. The people who attacked socialism discovered that it was not the Communist Party that was surrounded by the masses, but themselves. Here, the matter was very clear and there was no mystery, because in the whole of China, the vast majority supported socialism, the socialist movement was originally a movement of the vast majority of people, how could challenging the vast majority of people not be besieged? Bourgeois right-wing gentlemen, you treat the Chinese people's decades of revolutionary history as a child's play, you treat the Chinese people's eight years of construction history as a child's play, you treat the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people and the Party's high prestige among the people as a child's play, and when estimating the balance of power, you can't even figure out which side has more people and more power, the 1% of the population or the 99% of the population. How can you not make mistakes if you are like this?

　　Did the bourgeois right-wing elements make mistakes because there was no prior warning? That was not the case. Let us not talk about how serious struggles the people have experienced in order to choose the socialist road and choose the leadership of the Communist Party; let us not talk about how the constitution has determined the nature of our country; let us not talk about what the outcome of the Hungarian incident was, and what lessons the Chinese Communists have learned from the Hungarian incident (the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" has said enough about this). Even in Chairman Mao's speech, it was clearly stated that the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie was originally an antagonistic contradiction, and if the bourgeoisie did not accept the policies of the working class, the contradiction between the two would still become a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy; it was also clearly stated that we must reject bourgeois democracy and anarchism, and we must adhere to the democracy of the proletariat and the working people, and adhere to democracy under centralized guidance; it was also clearly stated that it was completely wrong to deny the great achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and it was completely wrong to deny the victory of agricultural cooperation and the improvement of farmers' lives; it was also clearly stated that bourgeois elements still have two sides and need to continue to be transformed; it was also clearly stated that intellectuals also need to continue to be transformed and need to strengthen Marxist political education; it was also clearly stated that wrong opinions must be criticized, and Marxism must also be developed in the struggle against anti-Marxist ideas. Isn't all this very clear and definite? Did anyone say that the principles of socialism and the principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat can be overthrown, and that wrong opinions and anti-socialist opinions can not be criticized? But the right-wing elements turned a deaf ear to all the words that did not suit their wishes. For them, "great blooming and great contending" or "helping rectification" were nothing more than a catalyst, an excuse. Xiang Zhuang brandished his sword, his intention was to kill Liu Bang. The rightists' "blooming and contending" was intended to attack the socialist system and overthrow the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party. Since this is the case, the working class, the working people, and the revolutionary intellectuals cannot but resolutely carry out a counterattack. Some people say, didn't the Party ask others to help it rectify itself, how did it rectify others? That's right, the Party will continue to ask the broad masses to help it rectify itself, there is no doubt about this, it must be adhered to to the end, and it will inevitably be adhered to to the end. But can the reactionary words and deeds of the anti-socialist bourgeois right-wing elements also be protected and not criticized? If the revolutionary leaders of all circles are not vigilant and aware of anti-socialist words and actions (no matter what sacred name they borrow), and do not know how to meet them head-on, what responsibility do such revolutionaries have for the cause of the people?

　　Some people also say that the large-scale class struggle that was originally talked about has basically ended, how come we are talking about class struggle again now? The large-scale class struggle has basically ended, this is a fact, but on the political front and on the ideological front, class struggle will continue to exist for a considerable period of time, this is also a fact. Everyone sees that this struggle was not provoked by the working class. The ancients had a saying: the tree wants to be quiet, but the wind does not stop. Why doesn't the wind stop? Let us look back at history. China's socialist revolution was carried out peacefully. In order to prepare for the socialist revolution, although there was an ideological transformation movement and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" movements, the former focused on distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and the latter focused on opposing corruption and theft, but in fact, there had not been a serious and thorough debate on where to go on the capitalist road and the socialist road, and which was good and which was bad. The bourgeois right-wing political activists and the bourgeois right-wing intellectuals, although they also mingled with the masses to welcome the new and send off the old, they did not agree. Since they did not agree, their anti-socialist wind could not stop. Now there are many facts that prove that some people have long had other intentions, they not only do not agree with the socialist revolution, but also have long disagreed with the thorough democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, in any case, a debate is inevitable. There was originally a debate, and it was a fundamental and unambiguous debate, is it better to hide it and carry it out secretly, or is it better to put it on the table? Obviously, the former is not good, the latter is good. Superficially avoiding this debate will not help us to build a socialist society smoothly. On the contrary, after this debate, clarifying people's true colors will educate the broad masses of people. In this way, the understanding of socialism in the political circles, the intellectual circles, and all sectors of society will be greatly improved, the unity of the people will be strengthened more than before, and the socialist system will be more consolidated than before.

　　History moves forward in struggle, and people's thoughts move forward in debate. Rectification is an inevitable debate, and the criticism of bourgeois right-wing elements is also an inevitable debate. There is debate now, and there will be debate in the future. Chairman Mao's report is a report that advocates unity. The unity he advocates is not a false unity of seeming agreement but real discord, but a true unity achieved through debate. Therefore, Chairman Mao's report is also a report that advocates debate. The so-called letting a hundred schools of thought contend is precisely to contend. In the current debate, some people will inevitably think of the cold and warmth of the weather again. Although the saying of position cannot be agreed upon by everyone, it is an objective fact that the feeling of cold and warmth of the political climate is different for those with different positions. In the eyes of us socialists, the current weather is indeed a sunny day of great spring. Yes, this is an unusual spring, and the reason why it is unusual is that the political consciousness of the broad working class, the working people, the revolutionary intellectuals, and all social people who are truly willing to take the socialist road, and the political consciousness of the broad Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members will all grow and mature rapidly in the debate, with an unusual speed.

### 不平常的春天

专栏：社论

　　不平常的春天
    1957年的春天，对于我国的政治界和知识界说来，是一段不平常的时间。
    2月27日，毛主席在最高国务会议上作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。这篇讲演虽然到现在才发表，但是它的内容早已在社会各界人士中间传布了。这篇讲演根据马克思主义的辩证法，阐明了我国在所有制方面基本上完成了社会主义革命以后所面临的一系列根本问题。它对于提高我国人民的觉悟，巩固我国人民的团结，推进我国社会主义事业的健康的发展，无疑将产生深刻的久远的影响。我们且不说遥远的将来，只从2月底到6月中这短短一段时间来观察一下，就已经可以看出它所提出的方针的威力来了。
    由于系统地提出了正确地处理人民内部矛盾的方针，由于透彻地说明了百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针，由于在这个基础上开始了党的整风运动，我国的政治生活在过去一个时期内进行得特别活泼起来了。在一方面，人民群众对于党和政府的工作，提出了大量的积极的批评和建议，促使党和政府积极地采取步骤改进自己的工作，加强自己同人民群众的联系。在另一方面，某些对社会主义事业心怀不满的资产阶级右派分子，也竭力利用党所提出的口号，来扩张自己的影响，争取自己的地位。三个多月的发展，比平常状态下的三年还快；三个多月给予人们的教训，比平常状态下的三年还丰富。
    如果群众有意见不能够畅所欲言，党和政府怎么能够这样迅速地发现和克服自己的缺点呢？同样，如果人们的错误的以至反动的思想得不到充分表露的机会，群众又怎么能够这样清醒地识别他们的面貌，怎么能够起来纠正他们，批驳他们呢？
  对于毛主席代表党中央所提出的方针，各种人的反映是不同的。广大群众热烈地拥护这个方针，因为它支持了群众在社会主义事业中的积极性和创造性，使得党和群众的联系加强了。党的联系群众的有政治远见的骨干分子坚决地执行这个方针，他们懂得这个方针将大大地促进党的工作的改善，保证党取得真正的主动，保证党对于大多数群众的团结。但是党内也有一部分人曾经怀疑甚至反对这个方针，他们害怕这将要引起天下大乱，或者因为他们沾染着比较浓厚的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的习气，害怕受到群众的攻击。这一部分人落到了客观事物运动的后面，只是依靠党的教育改正了自己的错误观点，才能跟上历史的脚步。
    资产阶级右派分子是另一种情形。他们对于中国走上社会主义道路是不甘心的。匈牙利事件加强了他们的一种想像：在所有制方面已经建立了社会主义基础的国家，仍然可以推翻，可以变质。同人民群众相反，他们不但不把毛主席的讲演看作是巩固社会主义制度的武器，而且想入非非，以为可以利用它来作为削弱社会主义制度的工具。为了削弱社会主义制度，他们的第一个步骤是削弱共产党对于国家工作的领导。因此，他们要求共同领导，或者要求共产党在某些范围内退出领导。他们竭力把百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督的口号解释得适合于他们的目的，并且积极地在民主党派、知识分子、工商业者和青年学生中收集他们的支持者。5月间，共产党开始整风，而且要求党外人士帮助党的整风。他们认为机会来了。他们在帮助党整风的名义之下，不但夸大党的工作中的缺点和错误，造成一种只许讲缺点错误、不许讲优点成绩的空气，而且把官僚主义说成是社会主义的产物和代名词，把宗派主义说成是无产阶级专政的产物和代名词，把主观主义教条主义说成是马克思主义的产物和代名词，向社会主义制度和党的领导展开了猖狂的进攻。党根据群众的革命觉悟应该在斗争的风雨里培养而不应该在温室里培养的原则（这个原则在毛主席的讲演中反复宣布过），决定暂时不给予回击，让群众充分认识他们的面目，以便增长见识，得到教训。这样，他们的头脑更热了。在他们看来，简直到处都在反对党！简直就是匈牙利事件的前夕！简直非请他们出来挽救危局或者收拾残局不可！
    结果如何呢？
    同害怕者的预料相反，也同高兴者的预料相反，天下并没有大乱。向社会主义进攻的人们发现，被群众包围的并不是共产党，而是他们自己。在这里，事情本来是非常清楚、毫无奥妙的，因为在全中国，拥护社会主义的本来是绝大多数，社会主义运动本来是绝大多数人的运动，向绝大多数人挑战怎么能不身陷重围呢？资产阶级右派先生们，你们把中国人民几十年的革命史看作儿戏，把中国人民八年的建设史看作儿戏，把党和人民群众的血肉联系和党在人民群众中的高度威信看作儿戏，而且在估计力量对比的时候，连人口中占1％的人和占99％的人究竟哪一边人多力量大，都算不清。你们这样怎么能不犯错误呢？
      资产阶级右派分子犯了错误，是不是由于没有事前的警告？不是如此。我们且不说人民为了选择社会主义道路，选择共产党的领导，曾经经历过多么严重的斗争；且不说宪法怎样确定了我们国家的性质；且不说匈牙利事件的结局是怎样的，以及中国共产党人从匈牙利事件得出了怎样的教训（“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文对于这一点已经说得够详细了）。就在毛主席的讲演里，也明明说着工人阶级同资产阶级之间本来是对抗性的矛盾，如果资产阶级不接受工人阶级的政策，两者之间的矛盾仍然会变成敌我之间的矛盾；也明明说着我们必须拒绝资产阶级民主制和无政府主义，必须坚持无产阶级和劳动人民的民主，坚持在集中指导下的民主；也明明说着否认肃反工作的巨大成绩是完全错误的，否认农业合作化的胜利和农民生活的改善是完全错误的；也明明说着资产阶级分子还有两面性，还需要继续改造；也明明说着知识分子还需要继续改造，还需要加强马克思主义的政治教育；也明明说着对于错误的意见必须批判，而马克思主义也必须在同反马克思主义的思想作斗争中间得到发展。所有这一切，难道不是十分明白确定的吗？难道有什么人说过，社会主义的原则和无产阶级专政的原则可以推翻，错误的意见和反社会主义的意见可以不加批判吗？但是右派分子对于不合他们心意的话，竟一概充耳不闻。对于他们说来，“大鸣大放”也好，“帮助整风”也好，这原不过是一种触媒，一种由头。项庄舞剑，意在沛公。右派“鸣放”，意在攻击社会主义制度、推翻无产阶级和共产党的领导。既然如此，工人阶级、劳动人民和革命知识分子就不能不坚决地进行反攻。有人说，党不是在请别人帮助自己整风吗，怎么整到别人头上来了呢？不错，党还将继续请广大群众帮助自己整风，这是毫无疑义，必须坚持到底，也必然会坚持到底的。但是难道反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子的反动言行，也可以受到保护，不受批判吗？如果各界革命领导人物对于反社会主义的言论行动（不管它们假借什么神圣的名义）不知道警惕和识别，不知道迎头痛击，这样的革命者对于人民的事业还有什么责任心？
    还有人说，本来讲的大规模的阶级斗争已经基本上结束，怎么现在又讲起阶级斗争来了？大规模的阶级斗争基本上结束了，这是事实，但是在政治战线上，在思想战线上，阶级斗争还将继续存在一个相当长的时期，这也是事实。大家看到，这一次斗争并不是工人阶级挑动起来的。古人有云：树欲静而风不止。风为什么不肯止呢？让我们回顾一下历史。中国的社会主义革命是和平进行的。为了准备社会主义革命，虽然经过思想改造运动和“三反”“五反”运动，但是前者重在划分敌我，后者重在反对贪污、盗窃，对于资本主义道路和社会主义道路何去何从，孰吉孰凶，实际上还没有认真地彻底地展开过辩论。资产阶级右派的政治活动家，资产阶级右派的知识分子，虽然也混在群众中迎了新，送了旧，但是他们是并不同意的。他们既然不同意，他们的反社会主义的风就不能止。现在已经有了许多事实证明，某些人老早就是另有企图的，他们不但是不赞成社会主义革命，而且也早就不赞成反帝反封建的彻底的民主革命。因此，无论如何，一场争论是不可避免的。本来有争论，而且是根本性质的、不容含混的争论，掩掩藏藏暗地进行好呢，摊开在桌面上好呢？显然，前者不好，后者好。表面上躲开这场争论，决不会帮助我们平稳地建成社会主义社会。相反，经过这场争论，弄清了人们的真面目，就将教育广大群众。这样，就将使政治界、知识界以及社会各界对于社会主义的认识大大得到提高，人民内部的团结将比以前更为加强，而社会主义制度也将比以前更为巩固。
    历史是在斗争中前进的，人们的思想是在争论中前进的。整风是不可避免的争论，对资产阶级右派的批判也是不可避免的争论。现在有争论，将来还会有争论。毛主席的报告是提倡团结的报告。他所提倡的团结不是貌合神离、同床异梦的假团结，而是经过争论达到的真团结。因此，毛主席的报告也是提倡争论的报告。所谓百家争鸣，正是要争。在目前的争论中，有些人难免又会想到天气的寒暖。虽然立场之说还不能人人同意，但是立场不同，政治气候的寒暖之感也不同，这却是一个客观的事实。在我们社会主义者看来，目前的天气确确实实是一个大好春光的艳阳天。是的，这是一个不平常的春天，它之所以不平常，就是因为广大的工人阶级、劳动人民、革命知识分子和一切真正愿意走社会主义道路的社会人士的政治觉悟，广大的共产党员、共青团员的政治觉悟，都将在争论中迅速地成长着，成熟着，用一种不平常的速度。
