　　While Promoting Thrift, Expanding Sources of Goods:
　　Shanxi Market Eases

    Commodities such as paper, timber, coal, cement, lead wire, and wire nails, which were in short supply in the Shanxi Province market before the year, have tended to ease since the beginning of this year, with necessary inventories. Judging from the overall operating situation of state-owned commercial departments, the total value of goods purchased in the first five months of this year increased by 95.5% compared with the same period last year; the total sales value also increased by 24.1% compared with the same period last year. The above situation shows that both the production and consumption of goods have had new growth this year, but specifically for some commodities, the situation of production not keeping up with consumption needs still exists. For example, bicycles, sewing machines, granulated sugar, and some varieties of medicines are still in short supply.

    The easing of certain commodities in the market is primarily due to the extensive development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement throughout the province and the formation of a social ethos of thrift. Collective units that used to purchase large quantities of materials have greatly reduced their purchasing power; in addition, the development of social savings work has also reduced the pressure on the market.

    Secondly, the state's measures this year to appropriately slow down the pace of capital construction and compress agricultural loans have also brought favorable conditions for easing the market, especially for easing the various materials needed for capital construction.

    Thirdly, commercial departments have learned lessons from practical work, and have planned control over the sales of some major commodities; at the same time, they have given active support to the supply of raw materials needed by industrial and handicraft production units that produce daily-use industrial products, thereby also expanding local sources of goods. In addition, the government has further strengthened the management of the free market, preventing a tense situation of price increases and competitive purchases.

    At present, as far as the entire province's market is concerned, industrial products have further eased, and inventories have increased; the supply of non-staple foods has been or is being addressed with measures in many places, and the market will continue to tend towards easing in the future, which is predictable. However, at present, some industrial products and non-staple foods are still relatively tight in the market. For this aspect of the problem, commercial departments will continue to seriously study and solve it in the current rectification movement. ·Xu Jing, Xing Fucang·

### 一面提倡节约　一面扩大货源  山西市场和缓下来了

　　一面提倡节约　一面扩大货源
　　山西市场和缓下来了
    年前山西省市场上供应紧张的纸张、木材、煤炭、水泥、铅丝、洋钉等商品，从今年以来已经趋于缓和，并且有了必要的库存。从国营商业部门总的经营情况看，在今年头五个月中，购进商品总值，较去年同期增大了95.5％；销售总值也比去年同期增大了24.1％。上述情况表明，今年以来，整个商品的生产和消费量都有新的增长，但具体到某些商品方面，生产赶不上消费需要的情况，也还是存在的。如自行车、缝纫机、食糖以及药品中的一些品种还供不应求。
    市场上某些商品由紧张趋于缓和，首先是由于增产节约运动在全省广泛开展，社会节约风尚的形成。过去大宗购买物资的集体单位，购买力大为减少；加以社会储蓄工作的开展，也减轻了对市场的压力。
    其次是国家今年采取适当放缓基本建设速度和压缩农业贷款的措施，也为缓和市场，特别是缓和基本建设所需的各种器材，带来了有利条件。
    第三，商业部门从实际工作中接受了教训，对一些主要商品有计划地掌握销售；同时，对生产日用工业品的工业、手工业生产单位所需原材料的供应，给予积极的支持，从而也扩大了地方货源。此外，政府进一步加强了对自由市场的管理，防止了抬价争购的紧张局面。
    目前，就全省市场看来，工业品已经进一步缓和，并且库存增加；副食品的供应，许多地方已经或正在采取措施加以解决，今后市场将继续趋向缓和，这是可以预见的。但就现时来说，市场上有些工业品和副食品，仍较紧张。对于这方面的问题，商业部门将在当前开展的整风运动中，继续认真地加以研究和解决。　·许靖、邢福仓·
