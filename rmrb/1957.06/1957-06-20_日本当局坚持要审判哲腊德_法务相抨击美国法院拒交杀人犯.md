Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: Japanese government authorities have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the US Federal District Court's decision to refuse to hand over the murderer Girard for trial in Japan, and declared that this decision is not binding on Japan.

Minister of Justice Umeji Nakamura issued a statement today, accusing the US Federal District Court's decision of being "erroneous." He said that the Japan-US Joint Committee, established under the Japan-US "Security Treaty," had already decided that the Japanese court should try Girard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman. Complying with the committee's decision is the international obligation of the United States. He stated that the Japanese side is not bound by the decision of the US court and will continue to try Girard according to the established policy.

Nakamura also said that the fact that Girard threw empty shell casings at the victim already clearly establishes his crime of attempted murder. He pointed out that in other similar cases, even though the criminal acts of American soldiers were carried out while performing their duties, the jurisdiction over them always belonged to the Japanese court.

Acting Chief Cabinet Secretary Kitazawa said: "The decision of the Japan-US Joint Committee is the highest decision made according to international treaties. The US government has an obligation to revise the decision of the Federal District Court in accordance with the decision of the Japan-US Joint Committee."

Director-General of the National Police Agency Sato said that since the US government has decided that the Japanese court should try Girard, Japan should continue to prepare to exercise its right of jurisdiction. Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Takeo Miki also stated that this issue must be handled properly.

Social commentator Ikutaro Shimizu pointed out that the US Federal District Court's approach stems from their belief that Japan is a "defeated nation." The decision of the US Federal District Court will intensify the anti-American movement in Japan demanding the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 19th: US Federal Judge McGarraghy ruled on the 18th that the US government must not hand over American soldier Girard, who killed someone in Japan, to the Japanese authorities for trial.

McGarraghy is currently handling a request filed by Girard's lawyer to have Girard sent back to the United States for trial. McGarraghy rejected this request, but he unreasonably declared that Girard killed someone while performing his duties and that he can only be tried by a US court. Handing Girard over to Japan for trial would be a "violation" of Girard's rights under the US Constitution, and therefore the US government's decision to hand Girard over to the Japanese authorities should be cancelled.

After announcing this verdict, Girard's lawyer immediately expressed welcome and telegraphed the matter to Girard in Japan.

On the 17th, US Secretary of State Dulles submitted a memorandum to McGarraghy, requesting that Japan be allowed to try Girard. The memorandum said that the Girard case has aroused the anger of Japanese public opinion, and failure to hand Girard over to Japan would cause "serious difficulties" in US-Japan relations.

The State Department did not formally comment on the Federal Court's ruling on the 18th. However, according to State Department officials, the State Department may appeal to the Supreme Court, requesting that the Federal Court's decision be declared invalid.

　　日本当局坚持要审判哲腊德
　　法务相抨击美国法院拒交杀人犯
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本政府有关当局一致对美国联邦地方法院拒绝把杀人犯哲腊德交给日本审判的决定表示不满，并且声明这个决定对日本没有约束力。
    法务相中村梅吉今天发表谈话，指责美国联邦地方法院的决定是“错误”的。他说，根据日美“安全条约”而建立的日美联合委员会已经决定由日本法庭审判枪杀日本妇女的哲腊德。遵守这个委员会的决定是美国的国际义务。他表示，日本方面不受美国法院的决定的约束，将继续根据既定方针审判哲腊德。
    中村还说，哲腊德向被杀害者投掷空弹壳这一事实已经使他的图谋杀人罪行清楚地成立。他指出，在其他类似的案件中，虽然美国军人的犯罪行为是在执行任务时进行的，对他们的裁判权也总是属于日本法庭。
    代理内阁官房长官北泽说：“日美联合委员会的决定是根据国际条约而作出的最高决定。美国政府有义务按照日美联合委员会的决定修改联邦地方法院的决定。”
    日本植事总长佐藤说，美国政府既然已经决定由日本法庭审判哲腊德，日本就要继续准备行使自己的审判权。自由民主党干事长三木武夫也表示必需妥善处理这个问题。
    社会评论家清水几太郎指出，美国联邦地方法院的做法是出于他们认为日本是“战败国”。美国联邦地方法院的决定将使日本要求废除日美“安全条约”的反美运动高涨起来。
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦法官麦克格拉基18日宣判，美国政府不得把在日本杀人的美国兵哲腊德交给日本当局审判。
    麦克格拉基正在受理哲腊德的律师提出的一个要求，就是把哲腊德解回美国受审。麦克格拉基拒绝了这个要求，但是他无理地宣判说，哲腊德是在执行职务时杀人的，他只能受美国法庭审判。如果把哲腊德交给日本审判，就是“侵犯”美国宪法赋予哲腊德的权利，因此美国政府关于把哲腊德交给日本当局的决定应该取消。
    在宣布这个判决后，哲腊德的律师立即表示欢迎，并且打电报把这件事告诉在日本的哲腊德。
    17日，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经向麦克格拉基提出一个意见书，要求让日本审判哲腊德。这个意见书说，哲腊德案件已经引起日本舆论的忿怒，如果不把哲腊德交给日本将会引起美日关系的“严重困难”。
    国务院18日没有正式对联邦法院的判决发表评论。但是据国务院官员说，国务院可能向最高法院提出上诉，要求宣布联邦法院的决定无效。
