	From "Anglo-American Alliance" to "American-German Axis"
	Hu Ping
	Recently, the differences between the United States and its old "ally" Britain have become increasingly apparent, while the relationship between the United States and West Germany appears to be growing closer. West German Chancellor Adenauer visited Washington for the fifth time in late May to discuss bilateral relations and major international issues with the heads of the US government, receiving strong support from the United States. Prior to this, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a Council meeting in Bonn in early May, the United States reversed its usual practice of consulting with Britain and France before the meeting. Dulles consulted with Adenauer first and, at the meeting, joined forces to put great pressure on Britain, opposing Britain's new "defense" plan. At that time, a saying was circulating among Western diplomatic circles: the United States is replacing the "Anglo-American Alliance" with the "American-German Axis." This US-West German meeting provides new evidence for this statement.
	This shift in the internal relations of the imperialist camp has many complex factors: it reflects the intensification of contradictions between the US and Britain, it also reflects the changing power balance between Britain and West Germany, and it also reflects the deepening crisis of the US North Atlantic policy.
		The Storm-Tossed "Anglo-American Alliance"
	For more than a decade after the war, the United States has pursued a policy of "Cold War" and preparing for a new war, with Britain as its main accomplice. For example, on major issues such as organizing aggressive military blocs, obstructing German unification and disarmament, invading Korea, and attacking socialist countries, Britain has been the United States' main "ally." Britain has spared no effort in following the United States, hoping to obtain US support and "aid" to overcome post-war difficulties, to maintain its declining imperial status, and even to make a comeback. The United States, on the other hand, took advantage of this opportunity to further encroach on British interests and strengthen its control over Britain. This "alliance" relationship also helped it to issue orders to other Western European countries.
	In such a mutually exploitative "alliance," the two countries were fraught with contradictions even when they were most closely colluding. After the Suez Canal incident in July last year, this contradiction reached its peak. In the course of this incident, the United States initially played a double game, overstepping its authority, and then took advantage of the situation, putting forward the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to encompass Britain's colonial interests in the Middle East. The activities of the United States endangered the foundations of the British Empire. Thus, the relationship between the United States and Britain deteriorated sharply. A surge of anti-American sentiment swept through London. On January 5 this year, the day the United States formally announced the Eisenhower Plan, the British "Daily Express" wrote with heartache: "The steps that brought Britain to this point should be fully understood, and it must be determined to do everything possible and with all intelligence to prevent such a situation from happening again. How sad it is for a country that depends on others for its livelihood!"
	For several months, British officials have repeatedly warned the United States not to underestimate Britain, demanding the restoration of an equal "partnership," but American propagandists have bluntly told Britain not to regard itself as a great power anymore, but to settle for the position of a "compliant partner." Although the joint communiqués of the two governments continue to lavish praise on the "unity" of US-British relations, the "Anglo-American Alliance," which has dominated the North Atlantic Group for many years, is actually in a storm-tossed state.
		West Germany Competing with Britain for Supremacy
	Parallel to the development of US-British contradictions, the situation of West Germany and Britain competing for hegemony in Western Europe has gradually taken shape. In the past few years, although Britain's economic strength has recovered and developed considerably, due to the implementation of a militarized economic policy and discriminatory trade policies, it has greatly affected the normal development of foreign trade and production, finally leading to a serious financial and economic crisis. West Germany, on the other hand, after its defeat, has a far lighter military burden than Britain, coupled with other favorable conditions and strong US support, its industrial production and foreign trade have developed much faster than Britain's. From 1951 to 1956, Britain's total exports increased by only 28%, with annual trade deficits, while West Germany's exports increased by 112%, with a large trade surplus. During the same period, West Germany's industrial production index rose by 64%, while Britain's increased by only 17%. West Germany's economic strength, compared to Britain, has approached the pre-World War II level. West Germany is in a stronger position than Britain in terms of developing its own economy and carrying out foreign expansion.
	Britain and the United States jointly pursued a policy of splitting Germany and reviving West German militarism, originally intending to re-establish an anti-Soviet fortress on the Western European continent and use it to contain France, but the result was a repetition of the aftermath of World War I. The resurgence of West German monopoly capital and militarist forces has seriously threatened Britain's position in Western Europe, the Middle East, and even Africa, and has also posed a serious challenge to Britain's second-in-command position in the North Atlantic Group. The Americans do not feel uneasy about this change in the balance of power between Britain and West Germany after the war. "US News & World Report" recently said such sarcastic remarks: "It's strange that Germany always recovers more strongly than Britain after every major war," now "Britain is retreating to an island nation status in every respect," while "a part of Germany is still advancing by leaps and bounds even more than the whole of Britain."
			Washington's Calculation
	The Americans' attitude has its reasons. Imperialists' alliances always shift according to their interests. Now, in Washington's calculations, the "American-German Axis" seems to be more worthwhile than the "Anglo-American Alliance."
	After all, the main target of US monopoly capital's foreign expansion is still the very large colonial interests of the British Empire. In the past, under the banner of the Anglo-American alliance, it has indeed gained a lot from Britain, but it has also encountered increasingly fierce resistance. Last year, taking advantage of the period before the US elections, Britain even launched an unsuccessful but ambitious counter-offensive in the Middle East. On some important policy issues, Britain is becoming increasingly disobedient. Furthermore, although the British Empire still possesses considerable influence in the capitalist world and is therefore still an indispensable helper to the United States, it has a large framework, weak foundations, and is keen to maintain the status quo, and is not so enthusiastic about some of the United States' rash and adventurous plans. In addition, as an old colonial empire, its capital is not abundant and its reputation is bad. In Washington's view, getting too close is also easy to expose the truth of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Therefore, Washington is increasingly feeling the need to recruit a new second-in-command, one to act as an accomplice to the foreign expansion of US monopoly capital, and the other to restrain Britain. West German monopoly capital has high operating efficiency, has accumulated substantial funds in the past few years, and is eager to find territory abroad. Moreover, the Adenauer Group was promoted by Washington. With West Germany's status as a defeated country, the United States can control it more easily. At the same time, West German monopoly capital is happy to bask in the glory of the United States, temporarily acting as a subordinate, and slowly planning for future affairs. Therefore, it is just right for the needs of the United States. This mutually beneficial and mutually scheming axis has developed.
	For several years, Wall Street has been closely colluding with West German capital,抢夺 [qiangduo]搶奪seizing British markets everywhere. The combination of US and West German monopoly capital constitutes the economic foundation of the "American-German Axis." After Britain's failed invasion of Egypt, its weaknesses were fully exposed, and it tried to maintain its position of counteracting the United States, this axis has had new developments and stands out. The "New York Times" recently reported on the cooperation between American and West German corporations, saying that this is "more important than any political event since West Germany became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
			Britain's Countermeasures
	From some signs, it appears that Britain intends to resolutely resist the pressure from the "American-German Axis." In the recent period, Britain has taken independent steps on some important issues, regardless of US opposition. On "defense," the British government has decided to cut back on conventional armaments. This is to save some expenses to ease its difficulties, strengthen its economic strength, and reduce its dependence on the United States; it is also to concentrate greater efforts on developing nuclear armaments, hoping to strengthen Britain's position as a nuclear power, on the one hand, to facilitate intimidation of the socialist camp and colonial peoples, and on the other hand, to use this to confront the United States and overwhelm West Germany. On the issue of "embargo," Britain has separately announced the relaxation of trade restrictions on China after breaking off negotiations with the United States.
	Britain's decision to take independent steps on these two important issues stems not only from economic necessity, but also from the intention to compete with the United States for leadership in the capitalist world. At the same time, Britain recently announced that it would establish a huge military base system in Kenya, East Africa, and is planning to unite France, Belgium, and other countries to establish a so-called "Pan-African Alliance," which is clearly singing a different tune from the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In order to deal with the "Common Market" with West German participation, Britain is stepping up preparations for the so-called "Free Trade Area." Britain has also proposed a so-called "grand plan" to unite European countries. All of this is intended to counter the "American-German Axis" and strengthen Britain's position on the European and African continents. Not long ago, British Prime Minister Macmillan also visited West Germany and held talks with Adenauer, attempting to ease the contradictions between Britain and West Germany and weaken the "American-German Axis."
	However, the British ruling group still has many concerns in its struggle against the United States. Economically, Britain cannot completely get rid of its dependence on the United States all at once. Diplomatically, Britain is still unwilling to give up its policy of "strength" and is actively engaged in "nuclear deterrence." In this way, Britain's pigtail is still held in the hands of the United States, and it is not easy to get rid of. Britain has slowed down the pace of arms reduction due to US opposition, and has accepted US missile "aid," actually handing over part of its national defense sovereignty. On the issue of trade with China, although the restrictions have been relaxed, the "embargo" has not yet been abandoned, and the types of "embargo" are still being discussed with the United States.
	According to the current situation, the complex relationship between the "American-German Axis" and the "Anglo-American Alliance" is essentially a fierce struggle between the United States and Britain. For Britain, this is a struggle to maintain its great power status and strive for independence and autonomy.

    从“美英联盟”到“美德轴心”
    胡平
    最近，美国和它的老“盟友”英国分歧越来越大，而美国同西德的关系却显得日益密切。西德总理阿登纳在5月下旬第五次访华盛顿，和美国政府首脑讨论了两国关系以及国际上的重大问题，得到了美国的大力支持。在这以前，北大西洋公约国家5月初在波恩举行理事会会议的时候，美国一翻以往照例在会前同英法会商的作法，杜勒斯先找阿登纳商量，并在会议上联合对英国大施压力，反对英国的新“防务”计划。当时在西方外交界人士中传出一种说法：美国正在以“美德轴心”代替“美英联盟”。这次美国和西德的会谈，为这种说法提供了一个新的证据。
    帝国主义阵营内部关系上的这种推移，有许多复杂的因素：它反映了美英矛盾的激化，也反映了英国和西德力量的消长，还反映了美国的北大西洋政策危机的加深。
        风雨漂摇的“美英联盟”
    战后十多年美国推行“冷战”和准备新战争的政策，一直是以英国为主要帮手的。例如在组织侵略性军事集团、阻挠德国统一和裁军、侵略朝鲜、攻击社会主义国家等等重要问题上，英国都曾是美国的主要“盟国”。英国不惜追随美国，是希望取得美国的支持和“援助”来度过战后的困难，以维护没落中的帝国地位，甚至想东山再起。在美国方面，则是正好利用这个机会，来进一步侵夺英国的利益，加强它对英国的控制。这种“联盟”关系，还有助于它对其他西欧国家发号施令。
    在这样一个相互利用的“联盟”中，两国即使在勾结得最紧密的时候也是矛盾重重的。去年7月苏伊士运河事件发生以后，这种矛盾发展到了高峰。在这次事件发展过程中，美国始而玩弄两面手法，越俎代庖，继而又趁火打劫，提出所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图囊括英国在中东的殖民利益。美国的活动危及了英帝国的根基。这样美英关系就急剧恶化了。伦敦掀起了汹涌的反美浪涛。今年1月5日美国正式宣布艾森豪威尔计划的那一天，英国的“每日快报”痛心疾首地写道：“应该充分了解把英国弄到这种地步的步骤，并且一定决心尽一切力量和才智来防止再发生像目前这样的情况。依赖别国生活的国家真可悲呀！”
    几个月来，英国官方人士一再警告美国不要小看英国，要求恢复平等的“合伙”关系，但美国的宣传人却率直地告诉英国不要再以大国自居，而应当安于一个“顺从的合伙人”的地位。尽管两国政府的联合公报中仍大肆渲染美英关系的“团结”，实际上多年来支配着北大西洋集团的“美英联盟”已经是处在风雨漂摇的境地。
          西德同英国争雄长
    和美英矛盾的发展相平行，西德和英国争霸西欧的局面也逐渐形成了。过去几年，英国的经济实力虽然得到了不少的恢复和发展，但是由于执行军事化的经济政策和歧视性的贸易政策，大大影响了对外贸易和生产的正常发展，终于造成了严重的财政经济危机。而战败后的西德，却因军费负担远比英国为轻，加上其他有利条件和美国的大力扶植，工业生产和对外贸易都发展得比英国快得多。从1951年到1956年，英国的出口总值只增加了28％，年年入超，而西德的出口增加了112％，并有大量出超。在同一期间，西德工业生产指数上升了64％，而英国只增加了17％。西德经济力量同英国相比较，已经接近第二次世界大战前的对比水平了。在发展本国经济和进行对外扩张方面，西德还处于比英国强的地位。
    英国和美国一起推行分裂德国和复活西德军国主义的政策，本来是想在西欧大陆上重新建立一个反苏堡垒并借以牵制法国，但结果却重蹈第一次世界大战后的复辙。西德垄断资本和军国主义势力的重新抬头，已经严重威胁了英国在西欧、中东以至非洲的地位，也在北大西洋集团中，对英国的第二把交椅提出了严重的挑战。对于英国和西德战后力量对比的这种变化，美国人是并不感到不安的。“美国新闻与世界报道”最近说了这样的风凉话：“很奇怪，每次大战以后德国总是比英国恢复得更加强大”，现在“英国在一切方面都在退到一个岛国的地位”，而“德国的一个部分还是比整个英国更加大踏步地在前进”。
            华盛顿的盘算
    美国人的这种态度有他的道理。帝国主义者结盟总是以利害为转移的。现在，在华盛顿的算盘上，“美德轴心”比“美英联盟”似乎是更加合算些了。
    毕竟美国垄断资本向外扩张的主要对象，是仍然非常庞大的英帝国的殖民利益。过去，在美英联盟的旗帜下，固然也从英国捞到不少，但是也遇到了愈来愈猛烈的抵抗。去年趁美国选前期间，英国甚至在中东发动了一次不成功的但是野心勃勃的反攻。在某些重要政策问题上，英国愈来愈不听话。再者，英帝国虽然在资本主义世界里仍拥有颇大的影响，因此仍然是美国不可少的帮手，但是它架子大，底子虚弱，汲汲乎维持现状，对于美国一些莽撞冒险的计划，并不那样热心。加以老牌殖民帝国，资本既不充裕，名誉又臭，在华盛顿看来，搅得过密，还易暴露“艾森豪威尔主义”的真相。因此华盛顿愈来愈感到有招个新的二把子的必要，一以充当美国垄断资本对外扩张的帮手，一以箝制英国。西德垄断资本的经营效率高，在过去几年里积累了雄厚的资金，急于到国外寻找地盘。而且阿登纳集团，是华盛顿一手提拔的。西德以战败国的地位，美国更易控制。同时西德垄断资本也乐得沾美国的光，暂当部下，徐图王事。因此，它就正好适合美国的需要。这个两相情愿而又各有打算的轴心就发展起来了。
    华尔街几年来早就和西德资本紧密勾结，到处抢夺英国的市场。美国和西德垄断资本的结合，是构成“美德轴心”的经济基础。英国侵略埃及失败后，弱点暴露无遗，而又力图维持对美国的抗衡地位，这一轴心就有了新的发展，突出到前面来了。“纽约时报”最近在报道美国和西德大公司的合作情况时所说的：这“比自从西德成为北大西洋公约组织成员以来的任何政治事件更为重要。”
              英国的对策
    英国对于“美德轴心”的压力，从一些迹象看来是打算坚决进行抵抗的。最近一段时期中，英国在一些重要问题上，不顾美国的反对，采取了独立的步子。在“防务”上，英国政府已决定削减常规军备。这为了节省一些开支来缓和自己的困难，加强经济实力，减少对美国的依赖；也是为了集中更大力量发展核子军备，想借此加强英国作为一个核子大国的地位，一方面便于对社会主义阵营和殖民地人民施行恫吓，另方面又可借以同美国对抗并压倒西德。在“禁运”问题上，英国在同美国谈判决裂之后，已单独宣布放宽对中国的贸易限制。
    英国在这两个重要问题上决定采取独立步骤，除了出于经济上的必要，也抱有同美国争夺资本主义世界领导权的意图。同时，英国最近宣布要在东非的怯尼亚建立庞大的军事基地系统，并策划要联合法、比等国建立所谓“泛非联盟”，这显然是同“艾森豪威尔主义”唱对台戏。为了对付有西德参加的“共同市场”，英国正在加紧筹建所谓“自由贸易区”。英国还提出了联合欧洲各国的所谓“宏大计划”。凡此种种，用意都在对付“美德轴心”，加强英国在欧非大陆上的地位。不久以前，英国首相麦克米伦还访问了西德，同阿登纳举行了会谈，企图缓和英国和西德的矛盾，削弱“美德轴心”。
    但是，英国统治集团在对美国进行斗争中，仍顾虑很多。经济上英国还不能一下子完全摆脱对美国的依赖。外交上英国仍不肯放弃“实力”政策，而在积极搞“核子威慑力量”。这样，英国的小辫子就还在美国手中抓着，不易摆脱。英国在削减军备的速度方面，已因美国的反对而放慢，而且接受了美国的导弹“援助”，实际上是交出了一部分国防主权。在对华贸易问题上，限制虽已放宽，但“禁运”仍未抛弃，而且“禁运”的品种还在同美国商量中。
    根据目前形势看来，“美德轴心”和“美英联盟”之间的复杂关系，实质上主要是美英之间一场极其剧烈的斗争。对英国来说，这是一场维持大国地位和争取独立自主的斗争。
