Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:
　　Workers and engineering technicians in Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Kunming, Anshan, Shenyang, Wuhan, Huangshi, Chengdu and other places held forums on the 9th and 10th to counter the counter-revolutionary act of writing threatening letters and to denounce various anti-socialist remarks.

　　The sailors in Fuzhou said: The incident of Lu Yuwen receiving a threatening letter made us realize that we must not only pay attention to the enemy on the opposite side of Fujian, but also pay attention to the bad people hidden inside.

　　Lian Jianhua, head of the drilling team of Fuzhou No. 1 Machine Factory, said: Some people say that capitalists taking fixed interest is not exploitation, and that taking it for only seven years is the Party "plundering" their property. We workers want to ask those capitalists, where did your assets come from? You sucked the blood and sweat of the workers in the past, and now you say it's not exploitation to take seven years of fixed interest? We workers absolutely do not advocate letting capitalists take twenty years of fixed interest, and we must never allow the withdrawal of public representatives as some capitalists demand, so that capitalists can bully us again. We welcome those well-intentioned people to help our working class party rectify its work style, but we oppose those who attempt to oppose and undermine the leadership of the Party.

　　Jiang Ping, a helmsman who had just returned from a long voyage, said: Our fleet has always completed its transportation tasks by overcoming the enemy's heavy blockade in the Taiwan Strait. The threatening letter incident of Lu Yuwen made us realize even more that we must not only pay attention to the enemy on the opposite side of Fujian, but also pay close attention to the bad people hidden inside.

　　An engineer from Guangzhou Xicun Cement Plant said: 80% of the technicians in our factory are not party members, but we have not encountered the kind of "family world" that excludes dissidents in the Kuomintang era.

　　Seventeen workers, technicians, and engineers from major factories in Guangzhou held a forum on the 10th. They questioned Chu Anping: You said "the Party rules the world", are there not many non-Party representatives in the National People's Congress? Why are there so many non-Party members serving as ministers and deputy ministers in the Central People's Government? Are there non-Party members serving as vice governors in Guangdong, and are there non-Party members serving as vice mayors in Guangzhou? Cao Shouting, an engineer from Guangzhou Xicun Cement Plant, said: Including myself, 80% of the technicians in our factory are not party members, but the Party trusts us very much. We have not encountered the kind of "family world" that excludes dissidents in the Kuomintang era. Yan Changhui, a technician from Wuxianmen Power Plant, cited an interesting fact: every time a football match is held on Yuexiu Mountain in Guangzhou, there are thousands of bicycles parked at the foot of the mountain. Who do those belong to if not the workers? Workers in the old society couldn't even get enough to eat, could they afford to buy bicycles? What about labor insurance benefits? How many workers' children could attend elementary school, middle school, and university in the past? Isn't this an improvement in life? He said: More than seventy old workers in our factory over the age of sixty have retired and do not have to worry about their livelihoods. But in the old society, old workers over the age of sixty could only wait to die. He asked: Who exactly does Ge Peiqi represent?

　　Workers in Kunming asked Zhang Naiqi: Where does unearned income come from?

　　Li Ruiben, an engineer at Kunming Machine Tool Plant, said: The Party cannot withdraw from enterprises. I have been in this factory for a long time, and it can be said that I have changed several dynasties. In the past, under reactionary rule, only small lathes and small cars for children could be produced. Today, our factory can manufacture very precise machines, and fifteen kinds of lathes have reached world standards. These facts show that the leadership of the Communist Party is hundreds of times better than in the past. Now there are still some shortcomings, which is because the Party's leadership is not enough, and the Party's leadership should be strengthened.

　　Worker Li Guangyu said: Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest is not called exploitation, but unearned income. Where does unearned income come from? Unearned income is exploitation. Saying that exploitation is not painful, we have to give a part of what we have labored for to the capitalists, how can we not be in pain? This is simply all nonsense.

　　Yang Ruolan, an employee of the supply and marketing section of Kunming Smelter, said: Chu Anping said that now it is "the Party rules the world", but as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, he forgot that the National People's Congress stipulated in the Constitution is the highest organ of state power. Ask him if the National People's Congress is "purely one color"?

　　Engineers from Anshan Iron and Steel said: Old China only had furnaces with a daily output of fifteen tons. Now there are large iron-smelting furnaces with a capacity of 1,500 tons. Who can say that the Communist Party's leadership is a mess?

　　Zhi Bingyuan, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, said: I am a non-Party member, and I have experienced the Qing Dynasty, the old Republic of China, the puppet Manchukuo, and the Kuomintang. I studied engineering, and since graduating from school, I have always dreamed of China becoming an industrial country. It was not until liberation that my ideal was realized. I dreamed that China would manufacture locomotives, automobiles, and airplanes itself, and now these have become reality. Isn't this all the result of the Communist Party's leadership? Those who clamor for abolishing the Communist Party's leadership, can't they see these facts? Actually, they can see them, but they have ulterior motives, which is to push the Communist Party off the stage and not build socialism. We will never allow this to happen. Zhang Yue, Deputy Director and Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, said: As a technician, I can make a comparison between the new and the old. From the perspective of life, I once had to maintain my life by selling things in the old society, but now my life is stable. In terms of work, in the past there were only iron-smelting furnaces with a daily output of fifteen tons, but now there are large furnaces with a capacity of 1,500 tons. Politically speaking, in the past, one had to go to jail for saying a grumble, but now even words like Ge Peiqi's are published in newspapers. Based on the above three points, anyone who is honest, who can say that the Communist Party's leadership is a mess? Fan Chongmo, an engineer at Anshan Iron and Steel Steelmaking Plant, said: Ge Peiqi believes that China would not have perished without the Chinese Communist Party. I remember a saying circulating before liberation: "China will not perish unless the sky dawns." If there was no Communist Party, China would either become a vassal state of Japanese imperialism or a vassal state of the United States. Take Anshan Iron and Steel as an example, if there was no Communist Party, it would probably have become a sorghum field as the Japanese imperialists predicted when they failed.

　　Engineers from Daye Steel Plant said: The facts of the past few years have proved that as long as one can contribute to socialism, cadres both inside and outside the Party can be leaders. If we have to insist on one color, then we are the one color of socialism.

　　Ding Yunjie, an electric furnace steelmaking worker at Daye Steel Plant, said: "I have lived in Huangshi City for more than ten years. The Kuomintang shouted about building a 500,000-ton steel plant since 1945, but by 1949, they only moved a small blast furnace and a small Bessemer furnace from elsewhere. The small blast furnace only produced about 20 tons of iron a day, and the small Bessemer furnace only refined one furnace of steel every two days. What about now? We have open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces, and we are refining high-quality steel. The original small blast furnace has also been improved to produce more than 100 tons of iron a day, and the Bessemer furnace also refines more than 100 furnaces of steel every day. Without the leadership of the Party, could we achieve such results?

　　Firefighter Shen Zigui mentioned the great flood of 1954 and said: That time my hometown was hit by a disaster. At first, we were trapped by the water and had nothing to eat. The Party and the government sent ships to deliver food. When people got sick, they sent doctors to treat them. After the water receded, they provided loans to help the people rebuild their homes. That year, Huangshi City was short of food. The Party and the government bought rice elsewhere for 17 cents a catty and transported it here to sell for 13 cents a catty. Apart from our working-class party—the Communist Party—which party could do such a thing?

　　Office Secretary Dong Xiao said: "Chu Anping only talked about some party members becoming heads, why didn't he talk about many party members also working as cooks and cleaners?" Chen Boying, an engineer from the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, talked about his own experience and said: "The facts of the past few years have proved that the Party treats party members and non-party members the same. As long as one can contribute to socialism and correctly implement policies, cadres both inside and outside the Party can be leaders. On the contrary, whoever does not take the socialist road, even if he was originally a senior cadre of the Party, like Gao Gang, Rao Shushi and some degenerate and corrupt elements, will also be purged by the Party. If we have to insist on one color, then we are the one color of socialism. Speaking of anonymous threatening letters, Chen Boying said: "This is a consistent tactic of Kuomintang secret agents. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they adopted this despicable means, first writing threatening letters, then assassinating people. Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were killed in this way. We must protest, we must be vigilant!

　　Engineers from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge said: The National People's Congress and the CPPCC are attended by all parties. What is the basis for Chu Anping's "Party rules the world" argument?

　　Yi Chongrong, director of the planning office of the First Bridge Office of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Administration, said that Chu Anping's "Party rules the world" argument is unfounded. As the highest organ of state power in the country, the National People's Congress is attended by all parties, and the CPPCC is also attended by all parties. Let's just talk about our First Bridge Office, the chief engineer, deputy director, some department directors, and team leaders are all non-Party members. Chu Anping's "Party rules the world" argument is entirely based on the perspective of party affiliation and the pursuit of power and profit, not from the perspective of the people's interests. Engineer Liu Xitian said that some people say that party members and youth league members are plainclothes police among the masses. This is a slander against the Communist Party, and it is instigating the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties and the people. What's wrong with party members reflecting the political and ideological situation of the masses to the Party, reflecting the demands of the masses, and listening to the opinions of the masses? Only enemies would think that this is not good.

　　Workers from Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory said: Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping and other erroneous remarks have raised our vigilance, indicating that someone is competing with the working class for leadership.

　　Bai Liangsheng, director of the gauge workshop of Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory, said that writing threatening letters is as insidious as secret agents planting timed bombs in Guangzhou. This behavior reminds me of the methods adopted by Kuomintang secret agents in Chongqing in the past. He said that to help the Party rectify its work style, one should be realistic. Chu Anping said that the Communist Party is "the Party rules the world," which is not in accordance with the facts. From the central to the local level, there are non-Party members participating in the work. I am an example. Although I am not a party member, I still have a position and power. Worker Ma Xinggui said: If the Communist Party doesn't lead, who will lead? Call Chiang Kai-shek to lead? The people of the whole country will definitely not agree. These erroneous remarks have raised our vigilance, indicating that someone is competing with the working class for leadership.

　　从南到北从东到西同声捍卫社会主义
    本报综合消息：  福州、广州、昆明、鞍山、沈阳、武汉、黄石、成都等地的工人和工程技术人员，于9日、10日纷纷举行座谈，反击写恫吓信的反革命行为和痛斥各种反社会主义的言论。
    福州的海员说：卢郁文接到恐吓信的事件，使我们知道，不仅要注意福建对面的敌人，还必须注意内部暗藏的坏人。
    福州第一机器厂钻床组组长连建华说：有人说资本家拿定息不是剥削，并说只拿七年是党“掠夺”他们的财产。我们工人要问那些资本家，你们的资财是那里来的，你们过去吮吸了工人血汗，现在拿七年定息还说不是剥削吗？我们工人绝对不主张让资本家拿二十年的定息，也绝不能像有些资本家要求的那样撤出公方代表，让资本家再来欺侮我们。我们欢迎那些善意的人帮助我们工人阶级政党整风，但是反对那些妄图反对和破坏党的领导的人。
    刚刚远航归来的舵工江萍说：我们这个船队，一直是在战胜台湾海峡的敌人的重重封锁中完成运输任务的。从卢郁文接到的恐吓信事件中，更使我们知道不仅要注意福建对面的敌人，还必须密切注意内部暗藏的坏人。
    广州西村水泥厂的工程师说：我们厂内有80％的技术人员不是党员，但我们没有碰到在国民党时代那种“家天下”排除异己的遭遇。
    广州市各大工厂的工人、技术员、工程师十七人10日举行座谈。他们质问储安平道：你说“党天下”，全国人民代表大会是不是有许多非党员的代表？中央人民政府为什么会有许多党外人士担任部长和副部长？广东是不是有非党人士当副省长，广州市是不是有非党人士当副市长？广州西村水泥厂工程师曹寿廷说：包括我在内，我们厂内有80％的技术人员就不是党员，但是党很信任我们，我们没有碰到国民党时代那种“家天下”排除异己的遭遇。五仙门发电厂技师颜昌辉举出一个有趣的事实：广州越秀山每一次举行足球比赛，山下整千辆自行车，那些不是工人是谁的？旧社会的工人连饭也吃不饱，能不能买自行车？有没有劳保的待遇，过去工人子弟能读小学、中学、大学的有多少？这算不算生活有了提高？他说：我们厂内已经有七十多个六十多岁的老工人退休，生活不用发愁。可是旧社会，六十岁以上的老工人就只有等死。他问：葛佩琦的说法究竟是代表谁的？
    昆明的工人问章乃器：不劳而获的东西从哪里来的？
    昆明机床厂工程师李瑞本说：党不能退出企业。我在这厂里很久了，可说是换了几个朝代。过去反动统治时代只能出产些小车床和小孩骑的小车。今天，我们厂已能制造很精密的机器，并且有十五种车床达到了世界水平。这些事实就说明了共产党的领导比过去不知好了几百倍。现在还有些缺点，那是党的领导不够，正应该加强党的领导。
    工人李光宇说：章乃器说定息不叫剥削，叫不劳而获的收入，不劳而获的东西从哪里来的？不劳而获就是剥削。说剥削不痛苦，我们劳动出来的东西要抽一部分给资本家，我们怎么不痛苦？这些简直全是胡说八道。
    昆明冶炼厂供销科职工杨若兰说：储安平说现在是“党天下”，但他身为光明日报总编辑，他却忘了宪法上规定的全国人民代表大会是国家的最高权力机关，问问他人民代表大会是否是“清一色”？
    鞍钢的工程师说：旧中国只有日产十五吨的炉子，现在有了一千五百吨的大炼铁炉，谁能说共产党领导得一团糟？
    沈阳矿山机器厂副厂长兼总工程师支秉渊说：我是个党外人士，经历了满清、老中华民国、伪满、国民党好几个朝代。我是学工的，从学校毕业后，一直梦想中国成为工业国，直到解放，我的理想才实现了。我梦想中国自己制造火车头、汽车、飞机，现在都已成为事实。这不都是由于共产党领导的结果吗？那些叫嚷取消共产党领导的人，难道看不见这些事实吗？其实他们是看得见的，不过他们是别有用心，那就是想把共产党推下台，不要建设社会主义，我们决不允许这样做。鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长、工程师张钺说：作为一个技术人员，我可以来一个新旧对比。从生活方面来说，在旧社会我有一个时期曾经靠卖东西维持生活，现在生活是稳定的；从工作上来说，过去只有日产十五吨的炼铁炉，现在有了一千五百吨的大炉子了；从政治上来说，过去说一句牢骚话就要坐牢，现在连葛佩琦那样的话都登报了。根据上述三点，凡是正直的人，谁能说共产党领导得一团糟呢？鞍钢炼钢厂工程师范重模说：葛佩琦认为没有中国共产党中国也不会亡。记得解放前流传一句话：“中国不亡，除非天亮”，如果没有共产党，中国现在不变成日本帝国主义的附属国，也要变成美国的附属国了。就拿鞍钢来说，要是没有共产党，恐怕早就像日本帝国主义者失败时预言的那样变成高粱地了。
    大冶钢厂的工程师说：几年来的事实证明，只要能为社会主义出力，无论党内党外的干部都能作领导者。如果硬要说清一色，我们就是社会主义的清一色。
    大冶钢厂电炉炼钢工丁云阶说：“我在黄石市住了十几年。国民党从1945年就叫着要修建五十万吨的钢铁厂，到1949年才从别处搬来个小高炉和小贝氏炉。小高炉一天只出二十来吨铁，小贝氏炉两天才炼一炉钢。现在呢？我们又有了平炉、电炉，炼的都是优质钢。原来的小高炉也提高到一天出一百多吨铁，贝氏炉也是每天炼一百多炉钢。如果没有党的领导，能做到这样的成绩？
    消防队员沈兹贵提到1954年的大水灾说：那次我家乡受了灾，最初被水困着没吃的，党和政府就派船送粮，人病了，就派医生治病。水退以后，又贷款救济，帮助人民重建家园。那年，我们黄石市缺粮，党和政府在别地以一角七分一斤买来大米，运到这里卖一角三分一斤，除了我们工人阶级的政党——共产党，哪个政党能办到这样的事？
    办公室秘书董肖说：“储安平只谈到有的党员做了头儿，他为什么不谈还有许多党员在做炊事员、清洁工呢？”总机械师室的工程师陈伯英谈到自己的体会说：“这几年的事实证明，党对党员和非党员都是一样看待的，只要能为社会主义出力，正确执行政策，无论党内党外的干部都能作领导者。相反，谁要不走社会主义的路，哪怕他原是党的高级干部，像高岗、饶漱石和一些堕落腐化分子，也被党清除了。如果硬要说清一色，我们就是社会主义的清一色。在谈到匿名恐吓信时，陈伯英说：“这是国民党特务一贯的手段。抗日战争胜利后，他们就采用这种卑鄙手段，先写恐吓信，再就是暗杀。李公朴、闻一多就是这样给杀害的。我们要抗议，要警惕！
    武汉长江大桥的工程师说：全国人民代表大会和政协都是有各党派参加的，储安平“党天下”的论调根据何在？
    武汉长江大桥工程管理局一桥处计划室主任易宠荣说，储安平的“党天下”的论调毫无根据。作为全国最高权力机关的全国人民代表大会是各党派参加的，政协也是各党派参加的，就说我们一桥处吧，总工程师、副处长、有些科室主任和分队的工长等都是非党人士。储安平的“党天下”的论调完全是从党派角度、争权夺利出发，不是从人民利益出发。工程师刘喜田说，有人说党团员在群众中是便衣警察，这是对共产党的污蔑，是挑拨共产党和各民主党派和人民的关系。党员向党反映群众的政治思想情况，反映群众的要求，倾听群众的意见，有什么不好？除非敌人才觉得这样作不好。
    成都刃具厂的工人说：葛佩琦、储安平等错误言论提高了我们的警惕，说明有人在和工人阶级争夺领导权。
    成都刃具厂量具车间主任白良生说，写恐吓信和特务在广州放定时炸弹一样阴险，这种行为使我想起过去国民党特务在重庆所采取的手段。他说，帮助党整风，应该实事求是。储安平说共产党是“党天下”，不符合事实。中央到地方都有党外人士参加工作，我就是个例子，我虽然不是党员，还是有职有权。工人马兴贵说：不要共产党领导谁来领导？叫蒋介石来领导吗？全国人民一定不答应。这些错误言论提高了我们的警惕，说明有人在和工人阶级争夺领导权。
