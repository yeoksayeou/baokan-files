Xinhua News Agency, June 27th -- TASS reported: The Soviet Union is drafting a plan to establish a unified national inland waterway system to connect the inland waterway system of the European part of the Soviet Union with the rivers of Siberia and the Far East.

After the establishment of the unified national inland waterway system, all major rivers in the Soviet Union will be connected to each other. At that time, large ships will be able to sail from the Baltic and White Sea coasts through the mainland eastward directly to the Pacific coast.

The Soviet Union currently has a total of 132,000 kilometers of navigable waterways, ranking first in the world. A major part of the unified national inland waterway system – the European part of the system – has been almost completely built. It connects the Five Seas (Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, White Sea, and Sea of Azov) and dozens of rivers in the European part. Therefore, it is now possible to see ships sailing from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Azov, and to see steamers sailing from Stalingrad to the White Sea; in addition, ships can pass unhindered between the western Urals and the Caucasus.

The Volga River, "Mother of Russia" – the longest river in Europe – currently accounts for nearly half of the total inland waterway transport volume in the Soviet Union. Due to the construction of a series of artificial reservoirs on this river, it will be fully navigable throughout this year's shipping season. Compared with 1940, the transport volume of the Volga River and its tributaries has now doubled.

In order to improve the shipping conditions of the Volga River and other rivers, new ports are now being built in Stalingrad, Kuibyshev, Saratov, Kazan, Gorky and many other places, and giant ships suitable for sailing in the "artificial seas" on major rivers have also been successfully built.

### 全苏重要河流将贯通  船只可以从波罗的海直驶太平洋

　　全苏重要河流将贯通
    船只可以从波罗的海直驶太平洋
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联正在制定建立全国统一的内河航运系统的方案，以便把苏联欧洲部分的内河航运系统同西伯利亚和远东地区的河流连结起来。
    全国统一内河航运系统建立以后，全苏联的重要河流将彼此沟通起来。那时候，大轮船就可以从波罗的海和白海沿岸经过内地向东直驶到太平洋沿岸。
    苏联现在通航的河道总共有十三万二千公里长，居世界第一位。全国统一的内河航运系统的一个主要部分——欧洲部分的系统已经差不多完全建成了。它联结了五海（波罗的海、里海、黑海、白海和亚速海）和欧洲部分的几十条河流。因此，现在已经可以看到船只从波罗的海驶到亚速海，看到轮船从斯大林格勒开往白海；此外，在乌拉尔西部和高加索之间，船只也可以畅通无阻。
    “俄罗斯的母亲”——全欧洲最长的伏尔加河的运输量目前占全苏联内河航运总运输量的将近一半。由于在这条河上建成了一系列人工水库，它在今年的整个航运季中将全部通航。同1940年比较，现在伏尔加河和它的支流的运输量已经增加了一倍。
    为了改善伏尔加河和其他河流的航运条件，现在正在斯大林格勒、古比雪夫、萨拉托夫、喀山、高尔基和其他许多地方建设新的港口，适合于在各大河流上的“人工海”中航行的巨型轮船也建造成功了。
