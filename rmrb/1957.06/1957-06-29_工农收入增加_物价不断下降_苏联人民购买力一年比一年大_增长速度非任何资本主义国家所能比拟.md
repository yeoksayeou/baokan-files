　　Workers' and Peasants' Incomes Increase, Prices Continuously Decrease
    The Soviet People's Purchasing Power Increases Year by Year
    Growth Rate Unmatched by Any Capitalist Country
    (Our Moscow dispatch, June 28th) The Soviet people's living standards are rising daily, and their purchasing power is growing rapidly. In the first five months of 1957, total sales of industrial goods and food in the Soviet Union reached 240 billion rubles, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. This rate of growth in the Soviet people's purchasing power is unmatched by any capitalist country. This was stated by Soviet Trade Minister Pavlov in an article in "Agitator" magazine.
    He said: In recent years, the Soviet government has implemented a series of measures to improve the people's material living standards: striving to increase labor productivity, gradually increasing the income of workers and farmers, and reducing prices. These measures have been effective. For example, in 1956, the reduction in the prices of some commodities saved urban residents at least 5 billion rubles. This year, in addition to further price reductions on some commodities, the prices of meat, milk, potatoes, grains, and other commodities sold in collective farm markets have decreased by 8% compared to last year. This year, state-owned and cooperative stores sold 22% more meat, 48% more milk, 30% more sugar, and 37% more eggs than in 1955.
    Before 1945, the Soviet Union was unable to produce electric refrigerators, electric washing machines, vacuum cleaners, etc. in large quantities. Now, the use of such advanced daily necessities is very common. This year, it is planned to sell 450,000 washing machines and 300,000 vacuum cleaners. In 1955, 19,193,000 watches were sold, increasing to 24,990,000 in 1957. During the same period, the sales volume of radios and televisions will increase from 3,957,000 to 4,500,000, cameras from 917,000 to 1,214,000, and sewing machines from 1,647,000 to 2,534,000. Woolen sweaters increased from a total value of 6.07 billion rubles to 12.04 billion rubles. Before the revolution, there was an average of one bicycle for every several thousand people; now, almost one in every three families has one.
    Currently, efforts are being made to solve the problem of insufficient supply of automobiles, furniture, pianos, building materials, etc. In order to meet the needs of the people's daily life, new types of radios, televisions, and new varieties of silk fabrics are being designed in large quantities.
    In order to facilitate people's purchase of needed items, the commercial sector is vigorously improving sales methods. In recent years, 200,000 automatic vending machines for selling milk, canned goods, and various daily necessities will be installed.

　　工农收入增加　物价不断下降
    苏联人民购买力一年比一年大
    增长速度非任何资本主义国家所能比拟
    本报莫斯科28日电　苏联人民生活水平日益提高，人民购买力迅速增长。1957年头五个月内，全苏销售的工业品和食品达到二千四百亿卢布，即比去年同时期增加了15％。苏联人民购买力增长的这种速度，是任何一个资本主义国家所不能比拟的。这是苏联贸易部长巴夫洛夫在“鼓动员”杂志上写的一篇文章中谈到的。
    他说：苏联政府近年来为了提高人民物质生活水平，实行了一系列措施：努力提高劳动生产率，逐步提高工人和农民收入，减低物价。这些措施已收到了效果。如1956年由于减低了部分商品价格，使城市居民至少节省了五十亿卢布。今年除了部分商品又减低了价格以外，集体农庄市场上所出售的肉类、牛奶、土豆、杂粮等商品的价格比去年减低了8％。今年国营和合作社经营的商店经售的肉类比1955年多销了22％，牛奶48％，糖30％，蛋37％。
    在1945年前，苏联还不可能大量生产电气冰箱、电气洗衣机、吸尘机等等，现在，使用这种高等日用品已是非常普遍的事了。今年计划出售四十五万架洗衣机、三十万架吸尘机。1955年出售了手表一千九百一十九万三千只，1957年增加为二千四百九十九万只。在同一时期内，收音机、电视机出售量将由三百九十五万七千架增加到四百五十万架，照像机将由九十一万七千架增加到一百二十一万四千架，缝纫机将由一百六十四万七千架增至二百五十三万四千架。毛衣由总值六十亿七千万卢布增加为一百二十亿四千万卢布。革命前平均数千人才有一辆自行车，现在差不多每三家就有一辆了。
    目前正在设法解决小汽车、家具、钢琴、建筑材料等供不应求的问题。为了满足人民日常生活的需要，正在大量设计新型的收音机、电视机和新品种丝绸衣料。
    为了便利人民购买所需的物品，商业部门正在大力改进售货方法，最近几年内将安装起二十万架自动出售牛奶、罐头和各式日用品的售货机。
