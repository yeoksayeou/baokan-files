Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, Major General Zheng Guolu, today wrote to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, expressing his expectation that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will contribute to correcting the US side's actions in violating the Korean Armistice Agreement.

　　In his letter, Zheng Guolu stated that after the United Nations Command unilaterally announced the abrogation of Article 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement on June 21st, despite strong protests from our side and stern condemnation from peace-loving people around the world, the United Nations Command still refuses to cease its illegal actions.

　　The letter stated that this new act of sabotage against the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command goes against the wishes of peace-loving people around the world for comprehensive disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. It will exacerbate the tense situation in Korea and the Far East, instigate an arms race in Korea, and create the danger of renewed war. Zheng Guolu pointed out that this new act of sabotage against the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command is an attempt to transform South Korea into a forward atomic war base for the United States, and is an organic part of the American ruling clique's entire plan to launch aggressive atomic war.

　　Zheng Guolu concluded by expressing his belief that, in the current situation caused by this serious violation of the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as an institution supervising the implementation of the Armistice Agreement, which has played and is playing a positive role in maintaining the Armistice Agreement, will make its due contribution.

　　郑国禄写信给中立国监委会
    希望纠正美国非法行动
    新华社平壤27日电  据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将今天写信给中立国监察委员会，表示期待中立国监察委员会在纠正美方破坏朝鲜停战协定行动方面作出贡献。
    郑国禄少将在信中说，联合国军方面在6月21日片面宣布废弃朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项以后，虽经我方提出强硬抗议和全世界爱好和平人民提出严正谴责，但是联合国军方面仍然不肯停止它的非法行为。
    信中说，联合国军方面对停战协定的这一新的破坏行为，是违背全世界爱好和平人民对于全面裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的愿望的，它将加剧朝鲜和远东地区的紧张局势，在朝鲜引起军备竞赛，并且造成战争重起的危险。郑国禄指出，联合国军方面对于停战协定的这种新的破坏行为，是企图变南朝鲜为美国的原子战争前哨基地，是美国统治集团发动侵略性的原子战争的整个计划的执行上的一个有机的环节。
    郑国禄最后表示相信，在由于联合国军方面的这种严重违反停战协定的行为而造成的目前的形势下，作为一个监察停战协定的执行机构、在维护停战协定中曾经起过并且正在起着肯定作用的中立国监察委员会将会作出应有的贡献。
