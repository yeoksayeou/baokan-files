A group of Hungarian children go to Bulgaria for vacation

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) To aid Hungarians victimized during the October Incident last year, the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, General Trade Union, and Red Cross launched a fundraising campaign not long ago, raising 28 million leva in a very short period. A portion of the goods purchased with this money has already been transported to Hungary. Another portion, consisting of clothes, food, and medicine worth five to six million forints, was also flown to Hungary. These planes, on their return to Bulgaria, carried one hundred and seventy Hungarian children between the ages of six and ten. These Hungarian children will enjoy a pleasant four-month holiday in Bulgaria. (Attached picture)

    一批匈牙利儿童赴保度假
    本报讯　为了援助去年十月事件中受害的匈牙利人，保加利亚祖国阵线、总工会和红十字会在不久以前曾发起了一个募捐运动，在很短期间，就募集了二千八百万利瓦。用这笔钱购买的一部分货物已经运到了匈牙利。另一部分价值五、六百万福林的衣服、粮食和药品也用飞机运抵匈牙利。这些飞机在返回保加利亚的时候，运回了一百七十个从六岁到十岁的匈牙利儿童。这些匈牙利儿童将在保加利亚愉快地度过四个月的假日。（附图片）
