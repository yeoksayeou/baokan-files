Believe It or Not

Ding San

Someone says that bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism, because capitalism cannot be restored in China, but bureaucracy will be restored in people's minds at all times. But what if capitalism also "restores in people's minds at all times"? That probably doesn't matter either, because it is said that the efficiency of capitalist enterprises is higher than that of socialist enterprises "plus" bureaucracy. But even if this is true, I still have questions: Didn't you say that the purpose of capitalists being "good at selecting talent, and trying to show fairness (?) in the training and promotion of talent" is to "seek profit"? And here, the so-called "seeking profit" is another name for "exploitation." No matter how "dangerous" bureaucracy in socialist enterprises is, it will not be "more dangerous" than restoring the system of exploitation, right? Moreover, socialist enterprises do not necessarily have to have bureaucracy; even if they do, it is "added," that is to say, it can be "subtracted." And after "subtracting" bureaucracy, there is no reason why the efficiency of socialist enterprises should not greatly exceed that of capitalist enterprises. As for bureaucracy, isn't the bureaucracy built on the foundation of exploitation in capitalist enterprises more detestable than the bureaucracy "added" to socialist enterprises? So my conclusion is just the opposite: capitalism is a more dangerous enemy than bureaucracy!

It is said that the nature of "fixed interest" is not exploitation, but unearned income. Why? It is said that according to the literal meaning of exploitation, the exploited should be very painful, but we also say that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is not antagonistic at present, which does not make sense. In fact, the absence of antagonistic contradictions does not mean the absence of contradictions; the exploited's feeling about "fixed interest" is certainly not "very painful," but it does not mean that there is no pain. No matter how many digits are after the decimal point, it will not be equal to zero, right? What is "incomprehensible"? What is really incomprehensible is separating "exploitation" and "unearned income"!

Some people say that the two-sided nature of Chinese industrialists and businessmen must be viewed "dialectically," which is of course correct. However, the result of "viewing dialectically" is the interesting conclusion that industrialists and businessmen no longer have the two-sided nature peculiar to their class. Even more interesting is that another conclusion is drawn from this conclusion: the bourgeoisie and the working class have essential differences, but it cannot be said that the members of these two classes have essential differences; because the bourgeoisie can only be eliminated and cannot be transformed, while the members of the bourgeoisie can be transformed. I don't understand: why do bourgeois members who "can be transformed" not have the essence of the bourgeoisie who "can only be eliminated"? Are Chinese bourgeois members really "special" to such an extent that they don't even have the essence of their own class? If that's really the case, is there still a need for "transformation"? What kind of "dialectics" is this in the world!

But we should understand the central idea of ​​this kind of "dialectics." To put it bluntly, it means that Chinese bourgeois members have been "transformed" enough and do not need to be "transformed" any more; if they must be "transformed," they can only transform their "negative aspects" like the working class.

However, the "ideological materials" provided by this short article alone are enough to prove that they still have to be "transformed" properly. Capitalism is "restoring in people's minds at all times." Facts are always facts, believe it or not!

    有人说，官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人，因为资本主义不可能在中国复辟，而官僚主义却时时刻刻会在人们的思想中复辟。但如果资本主义也“时时刻刻在人们的思想中复辟”呢？那大概也不要紧，因为据说资本主义企业的效率要比“加上”官僚主义的社会主义企业的效率高。但是即使真的如此，我也还有疑问：你不是说资本家“善于选用人才，并且对人才的培养、提拔，还要尽量表示公平（？）”的目的是为了“图利”吗？而这里所谓“图利”者，“剥削”之别称也。社会主义企业中的官僚主义无论怎样“危险”，总不会比恢复剥削制度“更危险”吧？何况社会主义企业不是非有官僚主义不可的，即使有，也是“加上”的，就是说，可以“减”掉的。而“减”掉官僚主义之后，社会主义企业的效率就没有任何理由不大大超过资本主义企业的效率吧。至于官僚主义，难道建立在剥削基础上的资本主义企业没有比“加”在社会主义企业上的官僚主义更可恶的官僚主义吗？所以我的结论恰恰相反：资本主义是比官僚主义更危险的敌人！
                      ＊　＊
    据说“定息”的性质不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入。为什么？据说照剥削字面讲，被剥削者应该是很痛苦的，但我们又说当前资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾并无对抗性，这就说不通了。其实没有对抗性矛盾不等于没有矛盾；被剥削者对于“定息”的感受固然不“很痛苦”，但也不等于没有痛苦，小数点以后不管有多少位，总不会等于零吧？有什么“说不通”呢？真正说不通的倒是把“剥削”与“不劳而获”截然分开！

    有人说，关于中国工商业者的两面性问题，必须“辩证地”看，这当然是对的。可是“辩证地看”的结果，却是工商业者已经没有本阶级特有的两面性的有趣结论。更有趣的是从这个结论得出另一个结论：资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但这两个阶级的分子却不能说有本质的区别；因为资产阶级只能消灭，不能改造，而资产阶级分子却是可以改造的。我不懂：为什么“可以改造”的资产阶级分子就没有“只能消灭”的资产阶级的本质呢？难道中国资产阶级分子居然“特殊”到这样程度，连本阶级的本质都没有了？果真如此，还用得着“改造”吗？世上哪有这样的“辩证”论！
    但我们应该懂得这种“辩证”论的中心思想。要是打开天窗说亮话，那是说：中国资产阶级分子已经“改造”得够了，不需要再“改造”什么了；如果硬要“改造”的话，也只能像工人阶级一样地改造“消极面”。
    然而光是这篇短文所提供的“思想材料”，也足以证明他们还得好好地“改造”。资本主义“时时刻刻在人们的思想中复辟”哩。事实总是事实，信不信由你！
