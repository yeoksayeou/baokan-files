Leaders of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Send Letters to This Newspaper
Supporting the Anti-American Struggle of the Taiwanese People

    This newspaper reports that Bui Ky, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, sent a letter to this newspaper on June 4, stating that the Vietnamese people resolutely support the struggle of the Taiwanese people against American imperialism.

    Bui Ky said that the struggle of the Taiwanese people proves that American imperialism cannot use authority and violence—including all kinds of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs—to suppress the people who are determined to defend peace, unification, and the integrity of their territory.

    Bui Ky said that the anti-American demonstration by tens of thousands of people in Taipei on May 24, 1957, was the Taiwanese people’s outpouring of long-suppressed hatred towards American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The cries of "Yankee Go Home" shaking Taiwan, combined with the anti-American struggles in many places such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and the Middle East, which are still enslaved by American imperialism, show the strength of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and the world who have risen and are rising to take control of their own destiny and oppose American imperialist interference and aggression.

    Bui Ky pointed out that, like Taiwan, American imperialism has fostered a barbaric fascist system in South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a base for preparing a new war.

    Bui Ky said that, being in the same situation of national division and facing the common enemy of American imperialism, the Vietnamese people deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the struggle of the Taiwanese people against American imperialism. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that the 600 million Chinese people, united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, will surely complete the cause of liberating Taiwan. Pham Thi Thanh, Deputy Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian Solidarity Committee of Vietnam, Du Xuan Shuang, member of the Executive Committee of the Vietnam Bar Association, and Dr. Tran Huu Nghiep of Vietnam also sent letters to this newspaper expressing their support for the struggle of the Taiwanese people.

    越中友协负责人等致函本报
    支持台湾人民反美斗争
    本报讯　越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、越中友好协会会长裴纪6月4日致函本报表示，越南人民坚决支持台湾人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    裴纪说，台湾人民的斗争，证明美帝国主义不能用权威和暴力——包括各种原子武器和氢弹——镇压那些决心保卫和平、统一和自己的领土完整的人民。
    裴纪说，1957年5月24日台北上万人民的反美示威，是台湾人民把长期积压在心里的仇恨，一下子倾注在美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的头上。震撼着台湾的“美帝国主义滚蛋”的呼声，和尚在美帝国主义奴役下的日本、南朝鲜、泰国、菲律宾、中近东等许多地方的反美斗争融和在一起，显示了亚洲和全世界的已经和正在站起来掌握自己的命运、反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的亿万人民的力量。
    裴纪指出，和台湾一样，美帝国主义在越南南方扶植了一种野蛮的法西斯制度，使越南南方变成一个准备新战争的基地。
    裴纪说，同处于国土被割裂的情况，面对着共同的敌人美帝国主义，越南人民非常同情并坚决支持台湾人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。越南人民坚信，中国六亿人民团结一致，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，一定能够完成解放台湾的事业。同时致函本报表示支持台湾人民的斗争的，还有越南亚洲团结委员会秘书处副书记范氏成、越南律师协会执行委员会委员杜春爽和越南陈有业大夫等。
