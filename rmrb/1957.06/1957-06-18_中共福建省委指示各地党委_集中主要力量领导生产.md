Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 15th: The CCP Fujian Provincial Committee yesterday issued urgent instructions via telephone and telegram to local party committees, ordering them to immediately concentrate their main efforts on strengthening leadership over agricultural production and rural work; and dispatched work groups to go deep into various localities to inspect and help party committees at all levels make specific arrangements, so as to closely integrate rectification with leading production.

Currently, of the province's 7.2 million mu of early rice, approximately 20% to 30% is not as good as last year; pests and diseases have also begun to spread in various places, and some areas have experienced flood disasters. In the southern coastal plain areas, early rice is beginning to bud and head, urgently requiring strengthened field management; in the northern mountainous areas, mid-season rice and single-season late rice transplanting is also entering a busy period, and agricultural production is at a crucial season for increasing production throughout the year. In addition, before the summer harvest, issues such as the summer pre-distribution for a small number of grain-deficient households and agricultural cooperatives in rural areas must be resolved, and work must also be done to arrange for the placement of junior and senior high school graduates and demobilized soldiers to participate in production.

However, at present, the principle of "not neglecting rectification work while also working on production" has not been well implemented by leadership organs in many areas. Some areas emphasize comprehensive rectification; some cadres are afraid of being accused of "dodging the wind" or "escaping rectification" and dare not boldly lead practical work.

After a comprehensive analysis of the above situation, the Provincial Committee pointed out that the first secretaries of county committees should comprehensively balance rectification and production leadership. At this stage, more energy should be put into leading production. Counties that have not yet begun institutional rectification should postpone institutional rectification; counties that have already begun rectification should also suspend units with urgent work. Agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and grain departments should immediately transfer cadres to the countryside to promote production. Prefectural committees and provincial committees departments closely related to rural areas should also focus on guiding rural work.

　　中共福建省委指示各地党委
    集中主要力量领导生产
    据新华社福州15日电　中共福建省委昨天通过电话、电报紧急指示各地党委，立即集中主要力量加强对农业生产和农村工作的领导；并派出工作组深入各地检查和帮助各级党委做出具体安排，使整风和领导生产密切结合起来。
    目前全省七百二十万亩早稻，大约有20％到30％不如去年；各地虫害也开始蔓延，还有部分地区发生洪水灾害。南部沿海平原地区，早稻开始孕穗、抽穗，亟须加强田间管理；北部山区中稻、单季晚稻插秧也进入大忙，农业生产正处在全年增产的关键性的季节。另外在夏收前，农村少数缺粮户和农业社夏季预分等问题必须解决，还需要做好安置中小学毕业生和复员军人参加生产的工作。
    但是目前不少地区领导机关对整风工作两不误的方针具体执行得不够好。有的地区强调全面整风；有些干部怕被说是“躲风”、“逃整”，不敢大胆领导实际工作。
    省委全面分析了以上情况以后指出，县委第一书记要全面兼顾整风和生产领导。目前阶段应以更多的精力领导生产。尚未展开机关整风的县，机关整风暂缓进行；已经开始整风的县，工作紧迫的单位也应暂停下来。农、林、水利和粮食部门应立即抽调干部下乡推动生产。地委和省委与农村有密切联系的部门，也应该以指导农村工作为主。
