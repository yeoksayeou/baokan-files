Warsaw, June 21 (By Our Correspondent) – The Polish Parliament is currently discussing the draft Five-Year Plan for 1956-1960. This plan has been submitted to the Parliament by the government after revisions.

The draft stipulates that industrial production will increase by 49.1% over the five years, with the production of means of production increasing by 50.6% and the production of consumer goods increasing by approximately 47.4%. This means that industrial production will increase by approximately 9% to 10% annually. Government officials point out that this rate is relatively realistic based on the implementation of production plans last year and this year.

The development of the chemical industry occupies an important position in these five years, expected to increase by 200% during the period. This is because Poland has favorable conditions for developing the chemical industry, but sufficient attention was not paid to this aspect of production in the past.

Agricultural production will increase by 24.5% over the five years, or 5% to 6% annually.

Based on this rate of development in industrial and agricultural production, it is projected that national income will increase by 46% by 1960 compared to 1955. The real income of residents will increase by 30% over the five years.

The revised Five-Year Plan has made changes to the allocation of investment, mainly reducing the proportion of industrial investment. However, the absolute figure for industrial investment is still 18% higher than the previous Five-Year Plan.

The plan also stipulates that 1.2 million houses will be built in five years, of which 890,000 will be built with state investment, and another 310,000 will be built collectively or individually. The latter will be financed by state loans.

　　波兰议会讨论五年计划草案
    化学工业发展占重要地位五年间将增长一倍
    本报华沙21日电　波兰议会正在讨论1956—1960年的五年计划草案。这个计划是经过修正后由政府提交议会的。
    草案规定五年中工业生产增长49.1％，其中生产资料的生产增长50.6％，消费资料的生产增长约47.4％。也就是说工业生产每年约增长9％到10％。政府人士指出：根据去年和今年生产计划执行情况来看这种速度是比较实际的。
    在这五年中化学工业的发展占着重要的地位。五年中将增长200％。这是因为波兰拥有发展化学工业的有利条件，过去没有足够重视这方面的生产。
    农业生产在五年中将增长24.5％，也就是每年增长5％到6％。
    根据工农业生产的这种发展速度，预计国民收入到1960年将比1955年增长46％。五年中居民实际收入将增加30％。
    修正后的五年计划对投资的分配作了变动，主要是削减了工业投资的比例。但是工业投资的绝对数字仍比前一个五年计划多18％。
    计划并规定五年中将建住宅一百二十万间，其中八十九万间由国家投资建造，另外三十一万间由集体或个人建造。后者由国家贷款。
