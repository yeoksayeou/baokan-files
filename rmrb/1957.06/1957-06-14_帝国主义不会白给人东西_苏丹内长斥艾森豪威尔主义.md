　　Sudanese Interior Minister Condemns Eisenhower Doctrine
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 13th: According to a report from Khartoum by an "Evening News" reporter on June 12th, Sudanese Interior Minister Ali Abd al-Rahman said that he personally believes the Eisenhower Doctrine should be opposed.

Rahman, who is also the chairman of the People's Democratic Party, one of the ruling parties, said in a conversation with a reporter from the Sudanese newspaper "Battlefield News" that he believes the aid provided by the Eisenhower Doctrine can never be unconditional. Western imperialist countries will never give things away for free.

He said: The Baghdad Pact and Point Four Program are vivid examples for every free citizen and every independent country that believes in freedom and peace.

He said: "I think the danger posed by the aid provided by experts is even greater than the danger of the Eisenhower Doctrine itself. We must be more astute than Western countries in order to defend our rights, freedoms, and world peace."

The Sudanese government has not yet expressed a definite opinion on the Eisenhower Doctrine.

　　帝国主义不会白给人东西
　　苏丹内长斥艾森豪威尔主义
    新华社开罗13日电　据埃及“晚报”记者6月12日从喀土穆报道，苏丹内政部长阿里·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼说，他个人认为，应该反对艾森豪威尔主义。
    拉赫曼也是执政党之一人民民主党的主席，他在和苏丹报纸“战场报”记者谈话的时候说，他认为，艾森豪威尔主义所提供的援助决不可能是无条件的。西方帝国主义国家决不会白白赠送别国东西。
    他说：巴格达条约和四点计划就是摆在相信自由与和平的每一个自由公民和每一个独立国家面前的生动例子。
    他说：“我认为，专家所提供的援助构成的危险，比艾森豪威尔主义本身的危险还要大。我们必须比西方国家更为机敏，才能保卫我们的权利、自由以及世界和平。”
    苏丹政府还没有对艾森豪威尔主义表示肯定的意见。
