This newspaper reports from Henan on the 22nd: Members of the agricultural cooperative in Daolinggang Township, Xihua County, Henan Province, in the Yellow River flood area, gathered at a threshing ground to hold a discussion, vehemently denouncing the anti-socialist fallacies of the rightists. Liang Xuexian, a member of the Chunguang Agricultural Cooperative, said: "That person named Ge is blatantly lying. Let him come and see the actual situation in our Yellow River flood area. In 1938, the Kuomintang breached the Yellow River, washing away the villages completely. People fled to other places to beg for food, and many starved to death. In our Chunguang Cooperative alone, more than 400 people died, and 21 households were completely wiped out. Li Longjun of Liuli Village even ate his own child who had starved to death, and later he himself died of starvation. A young woman could only sell herself for the price of a pancake. Mr. Ge, do you know our tragic life at that time?" (At this point, he was already sobbing.) He paused for a moment, wiped his tears, and continued: "After liberation, the Communist Party led us to block the breach of the Yellow River and we were emancipated. We reclaimed wasteland for production. The Party and Chairman Mao gave us farm tools and seeds. When we didn't have enough to eat, they provided relief. They led us to establish agricultural cooperatives, and last year we had a bumper harvest. More than 94% of the members of the cooperative increased their income. Now, the entire cooperative of more than 2,500 people has enough food and clothing, and new houses have also been built. On average, each household has 170 yuan of surplus grain money besides food grain. During the New Year and festivals, each household can also eat more than three catties of pork. This year, during the New Year, each member household had three and a half catties of pastries, three and a half catties of meat, five catties of fine flour, and fifty or sixty catties of steamed buns and dumplings. Our cooperative also has a club with table tennis and croquet, a library with more than 700 books, a drama troupe, one college student, and 238 high school, junior high school, and elementary school students, as well as twelve classes of people's schools with 468 people. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, could we live such a happy life?" Liang Xuexian spoke emotionally three times before finishing his speech. He concluded by saying: "We, the members of the Chunguang Cooperative, would like to invite Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping to the Yellow River flood area, to our Chunguang Cooperative, to take a look. Don't let them sit in their rooms and talk nonsense!"

Zhao Wenfu, a member of the Luona Agricultural Cooperative, said: "Nineteen years ago at this time, I was threshing wheat in the landlord's field. When the flood came, my wife and I drifted outside for more than ten years. Now I have built a new house, and my children are in school. Whenever I think of the bitter days of the past, I feel sad. The night before yesterday, accountant Li Xintong read the newspaper to me. When I heard that Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and their gang were scolding the Communist Party, my heart trembled. I don't know what they have in mind. He said we don't need the leadership of the Communist Party. Isn't that asking for our lives!" Old Granny Yang, who is over seventy years old, said: "We are not fools. What Mr. Ge said can't deceive people. The Communist Party pulled us out of the Yellow River den, and now we are living a happy life. My daughter is still in high school! I think the Communist Party will never leave us, the common people. A few days ago, Chairman Mao asked the cadres to work with us and participate in the wheat harvest. The members were both happy and distressed when they saw it, afraid of tiring them out. The women in the cooperative cooked salted eggs and duck eggs for the cadres to eat. Can you say that our people want to kill the Communist Party? Unless it's Mr. Ge himself!" Zhao Zhikui, the female director of the Luona Agricultural Cooperative, was choked with sobs when she mentioned the situation before liberation. Her father was beheaded by the Kuomintang, her brother starved to death on New Year's Eve before liberation, and her children were sold to other villages. Therefore, she was very angry when she heard the reactionary remarks of the rightists this time. She said, let Mr. Ge come to my house and see! I will now receive them in my newly built three-room house.

The discussion started at four o'clock in the afternoon and continued until nine o'clock in the evening. Everyone spoke very enthusiastically, and they didn't even bother to go back for dinner. (Xihua Newspaper)

　　谎言抹不掉惨痛的过去　谩骂遮不住幸福的今天
    谁也不能使黄泛区人民离开共产党
    本报河南22日电　河南省黄泛区西华县道陵岗乡农业社的社员们，集聚在一个打麦场上举行座谈会，痛斥右派分子的反社会主义谬论。春光农业社社员梁学贤说：“姓葛的是瞪眼说瞎话，让他来看看咱黄泛区实际情况吧：1938年国民党扒开黄河口子，把村庄冲得光光的，人出去逃荒要饭，多少人饿死冻死了。光俺春光社就死了四百多人，死绝了二十一户。六李村李聋俊把自己饿死的小孩都吃了，后来自己也饿死了。一个年青妇女只卖得一个饼的钱。姓葛的，你知道我们那时的悲惨生活吗？（这时他已泣不成声了）”他停了一会，擦擦眼泪又说：“解放后，共产党领导我们堵住了黄河口子，翻过身来，我们开荒生产，党和毛主席给俺农具、种子、没有吃的还救济，领导俺建立农业社，去年又获得丰收。全社94％以上的社员增加了收入。现在，全社二千五百余人，家家有吃有穿，也盖起了新房。平均每户除吃粮外，还有一百七十元的余粮钱，过年过节，每户还能吃三斤多猪肉。今年过年时，每户社员，都有三斤半点心、三斤半肉、五斤细粉、五、六十斤的蒸馍和包子。俺社还有一个俱乐部，乒乓球、克郎球都有，图书室有七百多册书，有一个剧团，有大学生一名，还有高、初中及小学生二百三十八名，民校十二班，有四百六十八人。要不是共产党领导，俺能过这样幸福日子吗？”梁学贤激动了三次才把话讲完，他最后说：“我们春光社社员，要请葛佩琦、储安平到黄泛区，到俺春光社来看看，不要让他们坐在屋子里胡说八道！”
    罗那农业社社员赵文鬴说：“十九年前这个时候，我正在地主场上打麦。黄水一来，我和我老婆在外漂流了十多年。现在我盖起了新房，孩子上了学。一提起过去的苦日子，我心里就难受。前天晚上，会计李心同给我念报，我一听葛佩琦、储安平这伙人骂共产党，心里就打颤。也不知他们安的什么心，他说不要共产党领导，这不是要咱的命吗！”七十多岁的杨老大娘说：“咱一不憨二不傻，姓葛的说那话骗不了人，共产党把咱从黄水窝里拉出来，现在才过着幸福生活，我的女儿还上着高中哩！我看共产党什么时候也不会离开咱老百姓，前些日子毛主席叫干部和我们一起劳动，参加麦收。社员们看见又高兴又心痛，恐怕把他们累着了，社里妇女都把咸鸡蛋、鸭蛋煮着给干部吃，这能说咱老百姓想杀共产党吗？除非是姓葛的自己！”罗那农业社的女社长赵至奎提起解放前的情形，就泣不成声。她的父亲是被国民党砍死的，她的哥哥在解放前的一个除夕饿死的，她的孩子卖到了外乡。因此，她这次听到右派分子的反动言论，十分气愤。她说，让姓葛的到我家来看看吧！我如今要在新盖起的三间堂屋里接待他们。
    座谈从下午四点开始，直开到晚上九点。大家发言十分踊跃，晚饭也顾不上回去吃了（西华报社）
