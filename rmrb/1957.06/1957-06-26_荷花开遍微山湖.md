　　Lotus Blossoms Bloom Across Weishan Lake

    In recent days, 43,000 mu of lotus flowers have blossomed on the 130-li stretch of water in the four lakes of Weishan, Zhaoyang, Nanyang, and Dushan in southern Shandong. White, red, yellow... lotus flowers as large as bowls, with lotus leaves complementing each other, appear very beautiful and vibrant, making people feel as if the end of spring has not yet arrived.

    The lotus stamen is a precious Chinese herbal medicine unique to our country. Last year, the fishermen and lake dwellers collected more than 20,000 jin of dried stamens for the country, ensuring the needs were met. Currently, the Weishan County Pharmaceutical Company has made ample preparations to purchase the dried stamens and store them in warehouses. The lotus seeds that grow after the flowers wither are also a popular food, with an annual output of approximately hundreds of thousands of jin. (Ma Ma)

　　荷花开遍微山湖
    这几天，在山东南部的微山、昭阳、南阳、独山等四湖的一百三十华里长的水面上，有四万三千亩荷花开放。白的、红的、黄的……像碗口那么大的荷花、莲叶相映，显得十分美丽、鲜艳，使人感到春暮未去。
    荷花的花蕊是我国特产的一种名贵的中药，去年渔湖民给国家采集了干花蕊两万多斤，保证了需要。目前，微山县药材公司已准备充分的力量收购晒干花蕊入库。花谢以后结长的莲子也是人们爱吃的一种食品，每年出产约数十万斤。（马玛）
