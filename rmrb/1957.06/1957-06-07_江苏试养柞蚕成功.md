    Jiangsu Successfully Trials Raising Tussah Silkworms
    (Our newspaper reports) The tussah silkworm, originally abundant in northern Chinese provinces such as Liaoning and Shandong, has been successfully trialed in Jiangsu Province since its introduction in 1954. This year, it will be promoted and raised in many counties such as Yizheng, Liuhe, and Jiangning.
    Jiangsu also has good conditions for developing tussah silkworm farming, because: Jiangsu has approximately 500,000 mu of oak forests, which are concentrated and suitable for developing tussah silkworm production. As long as all relevant parties pay close attention to and cooperate well with the development of tussah silkworm production, in approximately a few more years, Jiangsu Province will be able to fully utilize its existing oak forests, producing 50,000 dan of tussah silkworm cocoons annually.

    江苏试养柞蚕成功
    本报讯　原来盛产在我国北方的辽宁、山东等省的柞蚕，从1954年引种到江苏省后，经过三年来的培育，已经试养成功，今年开始推广到仪征、六合、江宁等许多县去放养。
    在江苏发展柞蚕也有良好的条件，这是因为：江苏现有柞林约五十万亩，分布集中，适宜发展柞蚕生产。只要有关各方面对发展柞蚕生产都能很好的重视和配合，大约再有几年的时间，江苏省就可以将现有柞林全部利用起来，每年可产柞蚕茧五万担。　（李荣）
