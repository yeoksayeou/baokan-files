Our Hui People Will Have a Home
Professor of Peking University Ma Jian

Our country is a unified multi-ethnic nation. The Han population accounts for the absolute majority, followed by the Zhuang, and then probably the Hui. The Hui people number more than 3.9 million, distributed in cities and villages throughout the country. From Harbin in the northeast to Lhasa in Tibet, Bang Nong in Yunnan, Yaxian in Hainan Island, from Yining in Xinjiang to Quanzhou in Fujian and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, there are Hui people everywhere, engaged in various occupations, mainly agriculture and peddling. The vast majority of Hui people are poor, hence the nickname "poor Hui people." They live among the Han people and other fraternal ethnic groups, use the Han language, and maintain traditional religious beliefs and customs, as well as strong ethnic feelings. The provinces with larger Hui populations are Gansu, Henan, Hebei, Yunnan, Shandong, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, with the largest concentration in Gansu, where there are more than 1.1 million Hui people. So far, four Hui autonomous prefectures have been established nationwide: Linxia, ​​Guyuan, and Wuzhong in Gansu, and Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang. Ten Hui autonomous counties have also been established: Jingyuan and Zhangjiachuan in Gansu, Hualong and Xunhua in Qinghai, Dachang and Mengcun in Hebei, Yanqi Hui Autonomous County in Xinjiang, and Yongjian and Xundian in Yunnan. In addition, there is also Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou. This is unprecedented in Chinese history.

Inspiring Good News

At the provincial level, there are already the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Autonomous Region under preparation. The Hui people are the second largest minority in the country. If an autonomous region at the provincial level is not established, it will not be commensurate with their status in the big family of the motherland. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northeastern Gansu. This proposal was deliberated and discussed among more than 4,700 party members and non-party cadres. The plan proposed by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was repeatedly consulted and carefully studied by more than 1,700 Hui and Han people in Gansu Province, based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and unanimously agreed upon. Therefore, it is practical and feasible and can be accepted by the vast majority of Hui and Han people in Gansu Province. Now, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the 51st Plenary Meeting of the State Council have successively adopted this plan. After being reviewed and approved by the National People's Congress, this plan will be implemented, and our Hui people will have a home. We will welcome this good news with joy and excitement.

The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a great happy event for the Hui people across the country. We, the Hui people, express our heartfelt thanks to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of all ethnic groups in the country. We believe that only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao can our "poor Hui people" stand up, gain equal political status, and have the possibility of establishing an autonomous region at the provincial level. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region not only realizes the common aspiration of the Hui people for many years, but also proves once again the correctness of the ethnic policy of the Communist Party of China.

The Bitter History of the Hui People

We Hui people, like the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups, are also diligent, brave, love life, love peace, are unwilling to be humiliated, and are not afraid of sacrifice. As early as the mid-seventh century, during the prosperous Tang Dynasty in our country, many Arabs and Persians came to our country from land and sea to do business. More came during the Song Dynasty, and some of them settled in our country. By the thirteenth century, after the Mongols destroyed the Hui state, they conscripted a large number of Hui people to China. Among them were many famous scientists, writers, artists, and technicians. They introduced Hui astronomy, calendar calculation, and medicine to our country. They were sent to settle and cultivate land throughout the country, starting a settled and concentrated life mainly based on agriculture. They were all Arabs and Persians who believed in Islam. A few people from the Han and other ethnic groups also believed in Islam and lived together with the Hui people, and later became part of the Hui ethnic group. The Hui people have made many contributions to the founding and construction of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. For example, Prince Xianyang Saidianchi·Zhamsuding's development of Yunnan, and the world-famous navigator Eunuch Sanbao Zheng He's seven voyages to the West, are the best examples. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the Hui ethnic group was able to develop smoothly in politics, economy, and culture, laying the foundation for the formation and development of the Hui ethnic group. However, they did not obtain full freedom during the Yuan and Ming dynasties. For example, Emperor Shizu Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty clearly knew that the Hui people slaughtered sheep according to the religious laws of Islam, but he insisted on prohibiting the Hui people from slaughtering sheep by cutting their throats, and those who violated this would be sentenced to death and their entire property confiscated to reward informers. The Ming Dynasty implemented a policy of assimilation, prohibiting the Mongolian people and Semu people (including the Hui people) from marrying people of their own ethnicity, only allowing them to marry Han people. Violators would have their homes confiscated and their families exterminated, and they would be reduced to slaves of the government. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the suffering of the Hui people was indescribable.

By the Qing Dynasty, the Hui people suffered unbearable oppression. In order to resist the oppression of the Qing Dynasty, they carried out many bloody struggles in Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and other places. Although they suffered cruel massacres, they never succumbed. Bai Yanhu once led more than 4,000 Hui people to escape to Andijan in Tsarist Russia. Now their descendants number more than 20,000. They speak Russian outside, and speak a Shaanxi-accented Chinese at home. The Soviet government recognizes them as a minority group—the Dungan people. Their ethnic script is the Dungan script spelled with Cyrillic letters.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Hui people were often subjected to insults, oppression, and even massacres. The reactionary government did not recognize the Hui people as an ethnic group, and in the pseudo-election law called them "domestic nationals with special living habits," denying them equal ethnic rights. The dregs of our Hui people, such as Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, and Ma Buqing, also echoed and said that they were Han people who believed in Islam in order to gain fame and wealth.

During that dark period, the Hui people participated in the people's democratic revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the Sanbian sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region established Hui autonomous townships. Several "Hui Detachments" in the Bohai and Jizhong areas carried out the Anti-Japanese War under the leadership of the Communist Party. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, a large number of Hui youths in the Northwest joined the People's Liberation Army, forming Hui cavalry regiments, contributing to the liberation cause of all ethnic groups in the country.

Having a Hometown to Live in

When Chairman Mao wrote the article "On Coalition Government," he recognized us as an ethnic group. Representatives of the Hui people participated in the First Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Representatives of the Hui people also participated in the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region proves once again that the ethnic policy of the Communist Party of China is unwavering. We Hui compatriots will always follow the Communist Party.

Our Hui people live scattered throughout the country, as I said earlier. Many of them not only cannot enjoy the right to regional autonomy, but also feel that life is full of difficulties. They hope to be able to live together, at least several hundred households living together, with their own mosques, schools at all levels, hospitals, cinemas, nurseries, and kindergartens. Hui students who have graduated from universities and secondary technical schools, and general Hui technicians, all hope to be assigned to work in the Hui areas of the Northwest, so that they can have full convenience in terms of living habits. Ordinary Hui youths, whether cadres or workers, feel distressed when choosing a partner. If Hui young men and women can work together, this problem will be easily solved, and their parents will be relieved. We Hui people all recognize the Northwest as our old home. In the future, after the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, these wishes of the Hui people can be realized. They are all willing to move there to live and work in peace and build a socialist new China.

The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region occupies a superior position in the Yellow River basin and has good conditions for economic development. In terms of agriculture, Yinchuan and Wuzhong are fertile basins. There are now more than 3 million mu of paddy fields, producing rice. After the Qingtongxia Dam is completed, several million mu of paddy fields can be added. Ningxia is a land of fish and rice, and has long been known as "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall." This area also has vast grassy mountains and pastures, which can greatly develop the animal husbandry economy. The nationally famous Tan sheepskin is produced here. The eight major salt ponds in Yanchi County are salt-producing places that produce and regenerate endlessly. The abundant salt production guarantees the resources necessary for food, preservation, and the manufacture of hydrochloric acid, soda, bleaching powder, chemical fertilizers, and other industries. The Shizuizi coal mine in Yinchuan has a large reserve, which can supply industrial coal for the Gansu region in the future. Oil springs have been discovered in Guyuan, and the reserves may be abundant. The conditions for establishing some modern industries in the future are also available. In terms of transportation, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will be completed next year. In the future, the railway from Xianyang in Shaanxi to Wuwei in Gansu is also planned to be connected in Zhongwei County and pass through Guyuan County. Transportation in the autonomous region will definitely be very convenient in the future.

Finally, we Hui people warmly support the Communist Party's correct ethnic policy and freedom of religious belief, and we agree to the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The Communist Party of China has made it possible for us Hui people to have a home, and we express our heartfelt thanks.

　　我们回族人民将有家可归了
　　北京大学教授　马坚
    我国是一个统一的多民族的国家。汉族人口占绝对多数，其次是僮族，再其次恐怕就是回族了。回族有三百九十多万人口，分布在全国各地区的城市和乡村中；自东北的哈尔滨到西藏的拉萨、云南的邦弄、海南岛的崖县，自新疆的伊宁到福建的泉州和浙江的温州，或多或少，到处都有回族人民，从事各种各样的职业，主要是农业和小贩。绝大多数回民是穷苦的，故有“穷回回”的称号。他们同汉族人民和其他兄弟民族人民杂居，使用汉族的语言文字，而保持传统的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，以及强烈的民族感情。回族人民较多的省份是甘肃、河南、河北、云南、山东、青海、新疆，而较大的聚居区是在甘肃，那里有回民一百一十多万人。到现在为止，全国共建立了四个回族自治州：在甘肃的是临夏、固原、吴忠三个自治州，在新疆的是昌吉回族自治州。还建立了十个回族自治县：在甘肃的有泾原、张家川两个回族自治县，在青海的有化隆、亹源两个回族自治县，在河北的有大厂、孟村两个回族自治县，在新疆建立了焉耆回族自治县，在云南建立了永建和寻甸两个回族自治县。此外，在贵州还有一个威宁彝族、回族、苗族自治县。这是在中国历史上从未有过的事情。
    鼓舞人心的好消息
    省一级的自治地方已经有内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区和筹备中的西藏自治区。在全国少数民族中人口次多是回族，如果不建立省一级的自治地方，就不能够同他们在祖国大家庭中的地位相适应，因此，中共中央倡议，在甘肃东北部建立宁夏回族自治区，这个倡议曾先后在四千七百多名党内外干部中进行酝酿和讨论。中共甘肃省委提出的方案，经过甘肃省一千七百多位回、汉族人士，本着实事求是的精神，反复协商，认真研究，取得一致的同意之后，由甘肃省人民委员会和人民政协甘肃省委员会联席会议一致通过，所以是切实可行的，是甘肃省回、汉族绝大多数人民所能接受的。现在，人民政协全国委员会常委会扩大会议、国务院全体会议第五十一次会议又先后通过这个方案，再经过全国人民代表大会审议批准后，这个方案就要付诸实施，我回族人民将有家可归，我们将以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接这个好消息。
    宁夏回族自治区的建立，就全国回族人民说来是一件大喜事，我们回族人民对中国共产党和全国各族人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席表示衷心的感谢。我们相信，只有在中国共产党和毛主席英明的领导下，我们“穷回回”才能翻身，才能获得平等的政治地位，也才有可能建立省一级的回族自治地方。宁夏回族自治区的建立，不仅实现了回族人民多少年来的共同愿望，而且又一次证明中国共产党民族政策的正确性。
    回族人民的辛酸历史
    我们回族人民，像汉族和其他兄弟民族一样，也是勤劳勇敢、热爱生活、热爱和平、不甘屈辱、不怕牺牲的善良人民。远在七世纪中叶，当我国盛唐时期，许多阿拉伯人和波斯人，从陆路和海路到我国来经商，宋朝时期来得更多，其中有些人就在我国定居下来了。到十三世纪时，蒙古人灭亡了回回国以后，把大量的回回人征调到中国来，他们中有不少著名的科学家、文学家、艺术家和技术人员，他们把回回的天文历算和医药等传入我国。他们被派遣到全国各地去定居屯田，开始了以农业为主的定居和聚居生活。他们都是信仰伊斯兰教的阿拉伯人和波斯人。汉族和其他民族中也有少数人信仰了伊斯兰教，而同回回人共同生活在一起，后来就成为回族的组成部分。对于元、明两代的开国和建国，回回人都有过不少的功劳，如元代咸阳王赛典赤·瞻思丁的开发云南，世界著名的航海家三宝太监郑和的七次下西洋，就是最好的例证。在元、明两代，回回民族在政治、经济、文化各方面得以顺利发展，奠定了回族的形成和发展的基础。但是他们在元、明两代并未获得充分的自由，例如元世祖忽必烈明明知道回回人是依照伊斯兰教的教律而宰羊的，他偏要禁止回回用断喉法宰羊，违者处死刑，并没收其全部财产，用以奖赏告密者。明代实行同化政策，禁止蒙古人民和色目人民（包括回回人）同本族人民通婚，只许同汉族人民通婚，违者男女两家都要被抄家灭门，降为官家奴隶。在元、明两代，回回的痛苦是难以形容的。
    到了清代，回族人民遭到难以忍受的压迫，他们为了反抗清朝的压迫，曾在陕西、甘肃、云南等地进行了许多次的流血斗争。他们虽然遭受了惨酷的屠杀，但是他们从来没有屈服过。白彦虎曾率领着四千多回民，逃到沙皇俄国的安集延，现在他们的子孙有两万多人，他们在外面说俄国话，在家里说一口陕腔的中国话。苏联政府承认他们是一个少数民族——东干族，他们的民族文字是用斯拉夫字母拚写的东干文。
    在国民党反动统治时期，回民经常遭受到侮辱和压迫，甚至屠杀。反动政府不承认回族是一个民族，在伪选举法上称他们为“国内生活习惯特殊的国民”，不让他们有平等的民族权利；我回族中的败类马鸿逵、马步芳、马步青之流，为了自己的功名富贵，也随声附和，说自己是信奉伊斯兰教的汉民。
    在那个黑暗时期，回族人民在共产党领导下参加了人民民主革命。早在抗日战争时期，陕、甘、宁边区的三边分区就建立了回民自治乡；渤海、冀中一带有好几个“回民支队”，在共产党领导下进行了抗日战争；在第三次国内革命战争中，西北的大批回族青年参加了人民解放军，组成回民骑兵团，为全国各族人民的解放大业贡献了力量。
    有了聚族而居的家乡
    毛主席写“论联合政府”一文的时候就承认我们是一个民族。人民政协第一届第一次会议有回民的代表参加，全国人民代表大会和各级人民代表大会也都有回族的代表参加。宁夏回族自治区的建立，又一次证明中国共产党的民族政策是坚定不移的，我们回族同胞将永远跟着共产党走。
    我们回族人民散居在全国各地，前面已经说过了，他们中有很多人不仅不能享受区域自治的权利，在生活上也感觉困难重重，他们希望能够聚族而居，最少能几百户住在一起，有自己的清真寺、各级学校、医院、电影院、托儿所、幼儿园。高等学校和中等技术学校毕业的回民学生和一般回民技术人员，都希望把自己分配到西北回族地区去工作，以便他们在生活习惯方面获得充分的便利。一般回民青年，无论是干部或工人，在选择对象方面都感到苦闷，如果回民的男女青年能在一起工作，这个问题就容易解决了，他们的父母也就放心了。我们回民都承认西北是自己的老家。将来，宁夏回族自治区建立后，回民的这些愿望都能实现，他们都愿意迁移到那里去安居乐业，建设社会主义的新中国。
    宁夏回族自治区在黄河流域占着最优越的地位，在经济发展上有良好的条件。在农业方面，银川和吴忠是肥沃的盆地，现在有水田三百多万亩，出产大米，在青铜峡水坝建成后，可以增加水田几百万亩。宁夏是一个鱼米之乡，早有“塞上江南”之称。这个地区还有广阔的草山和草场，可以大量发展畜牧业经济，全国著名的滩羊皮就出产在这里。盐池县的八大盐池，都是随产随生永不枯竭的产盐地方。丰富的盐产，保证了食用、防腐和制造盐酸、苏打、漂白粉、化学肥料等工业必需的资源。银川的石咀子煤矿，蕴藏量很大，将来可以供应甘肃地区的工业用煤。固原已发现油泉，蕴藏量可能是丰富的。将来兴办一些近代工业的条件也是具备的。在交通方面，包兰铁路明年即将修通，将来从陕西咸阳到甘肃武威的铁路，也计划在中卫县接轨，并且通过固原县。自治区的交通将来一定是很方便的。
    最后，我们回族人民热烈拥护共产党正确的民族政策和宗教信仰自由，我们赞同建立宁夏回族自治区。中国共产党使我们回族人民有家可归，我们表示衷心的感谢。
