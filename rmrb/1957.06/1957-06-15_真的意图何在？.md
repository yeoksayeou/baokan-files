What is the Real Intention?
　　Tie Yi

    Some people, including a few highly learned university professors, are voicing various opinions on "gentle breeze and fine rain." Summing them up, they are nothing more than two kinds: one is saying that the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" and the "Three-Anti Campaign" were all about the Communist Party rectifying "others," so they adopted a large-scale, vigorous and swift approach; now the rectification campaign is "others" rectifying the Communist Party, so they are adopting a gentle breeze and fine rain approach; isn't this unfair? The other is saying: in the past, the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" and the "Three-Anti Campaign" used a large-scale, vigorous and swift approach, which was wrong - "there were deviations," so now they have changed to using a gentle breeze and fine rain approach. The latter even described the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries," "Three-Anti Campaign," etc., as "utterly terrible" to prove that their words were based on evidence. According to these people, it seems that there can only be these two conclusions: either you admit that the current approach is "unfair;" or you admit that everything in the past was wrong.

    Leaving aside other rights and wrongs for the moment, what is strange is that, when comparing the differences between the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries," "Three-Anti Campaign," and the "Rectification Campaign," these two kinds of people only talk about the differences in methods, but never mention the fundamental differences in nature. "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" means "suppressing counter-revolutionaries." Even if you just look at the literal meaning, you know that this is "rectifying" the enemy, and resolving the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. This is not a difficult problem even for primary school students who know a few characters. However, learned university professors do not understand this. Is it that they really do not understand? Or are they unwilling to state it clearly? As for the "Three-Anti Campaign," the focus was on opposing corruption, and those who were rectified were mainly "corrupt elements" - the agents of the bourgeoisie in state organs. At that time, it was precisely when the bourgeoisie was launching a frenzied attack on the proletariat and the state. The purpose of this movement was to repel this frenzied attack. Since it was necessary to "repel" the frenzied "attack," it was naturally necessary to be "large-scale, vigorous and swift." Could this be considered wrong?

    There are many who dare to reveal the truth. Mr. Zhao Yumin of the Renmin University of China said: "In the past, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a joint effort by the Party and the people to suppress counter-revolutionaries, which was a matter of dealing with the enemy; this rectification campaign is to resolve contradictions among the people." How well said! Since it is a matter of resolving problems within the people, of course, we should use "gentle breeze and fine rain." This is not only the case for the Communist Party and leading cadres, but also for the people and the general public. Hasn't Chairman Mao said that we can only persuade the people and cannot suppress them? Then what is there to be fair or unfair about? Why do those who hold the view of "rectifying others" and "rectifying oneself" not dare to raise the question as directly as Mr. Zhao Yumin? What position are they speaking from? I think they are standing on the position of "others."

    I do not deny that there were individual shortcomings or even mistakes in the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements; nor do I think that everyone who has opinions or even dissatisfaction with the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" harbors malice. But we must expose the true intentions of those who are "harboring ulterior motives." In fact, whether they are proponents of "fairness" or proponents of "deviation," their true attempt to confuse the distinction between ourselves and the enemy is very obvious. The former is nothing more than wanting "others" to also vigorously and swiftly rectify the Communist Party, and the latter is nothing more than wanting "others" to overturn the verdict under the argument that "the past methods were wrong." And the fundamental purpose of both is the same. To borrow the words of Ge Peiqi, it is to stir up a "tempest" so that the Communist Party will be "buried in the belly of the fish in the tempest." Just look at some people who are writing anonymous letters, and some people who are running around in secret, and it becomes very clear.

　　真的意图何在？
　　铁衣
    有人，包括个别满腹经纶的大学教授，正在对“和风细雨”发出形形色色的议论。归总起来不外乎两种：一种是说“肃反”、“三反”都是共产党整“别人”，于是就采用大张旗鼓雷厉风行的方法；整风是“别人”整共产党，于是就采用和风细雨的方法；这未免太不公道吧。一种是说：过去搞“肃反”、“三反”用大张旗鼓雷厉风行的方法错了——“有偏差”，所以现在改用和风细雨的方法。后者还把“肃反”“三反”等运动说成“糟糕透顶”来证实自己言出有据。依这些人看来，好像结论只能有这两种：要么你就承认现在的作法“不公道”；要么你就承认从前的都错了。
    别的是非暂且不论，使人感到奇怪的是，这两种人在比较“肃反”、“三反”同“整风”的区别时，只谈方法的不同，却绝口不提根本性质的不同。“肃反”者，“肃清反革命”也。即使望文生义，也知道这是“整”敌人，是解决敌我矛盾。这对认识几个字的小学生，也不算是难题。可是饱学的大学教授对这却不理解，是真的不理解呢？还是不愿意明白地讲出来？至于“三反”，重点是反对贪污，被整的主要是“贪污分子”——资产阶级在国家机关里的代理人。当时正是资产阶级向无产阶级和国家进行猖狂进攻的时候，这一运动的目的，就是要打退这种猖狂进攻。既然是要“打退”猖狂的“进攻”，自然非“大张旗鼓雷厉风行”不可，难道这也能算是错了吗？
    敢于道破真理的大有人在。中国人民大学的赵玉珉先生就说出了：“过去肃反是党和人民一道肃清反革命，是对待敌人的问题；这次整风是解决人民内部的矛盾。”这说得多好啊！既然是解决人民内部的问题，当然就应该用“和风细雨”，这不只是对共产党，对领导干部是这样，对人民群众，对一般人也都是这样。毛主席不是说过对人民只能说服不能压服的吗？这还有什么公道不公道的呢？那种持“整别人”和“整自己”说法的人，为什么不敢像赵玉珉先生这样直截了当的提出问题呢？他们是站在什么立场说话的呢？我看是站在了“别人”的立场上。
    我并不否认“三反”“肃反”运动中有个别的缺点甚至是错误；我也并不认为，凡是对“三反”“肃反”有意见甚至不满的人都怀有恶意。但是一定要揭穿“别有用心”的人们的真正意图。其实“公道”论者也好，“偏差”论者也好，他们这种混淆敌我是非的真正企图是很明显的。前者不外乎是要“别人”也来大张旗鼓雷厉风行的痛整一下共产党，后者不外乎是要“别人”在“过去的方法错了”的论点下，来个大翻案。而两者的根本目的又是共同的。借用葛佩琦的话说，就是打算挑起“狂澜”以便使共产党“在狂澜中葬身鱼腹”，只要看有些人在搞匿名信，有些人在暗中奔走，也就十分明白了。
