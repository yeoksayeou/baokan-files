Does Every Factory Need to Build a Grand Auditorium?
By Our Reporters Chen Ji and Wen Shuxian
	During our interviews in Jilin City, we were filled with joy seeing the new industrial zones changing and growing every day. Longtan District, which was a wilderness three years ago, is now a place where new factories such as Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, and Jilin Thermal Power Plant stand in great numbers. Hadawan District, which was still desolate in the early days of liberation, has now become a prosperous industrial area.
	While we see these great construction achievements, we also see some wasteful phenomena in non-productive construction where each unit does its own thing and uses investment in a dispersed manner.
	In the Hadawan and Longtan areas, we visited seven factories and two construction units and found that each of them had a large auditorium. These auditoriums are very much like cinemas and theaters, most of which can accommodate more than a thousand people. The largest has more than 1,300 seats; the smallest has more than 700 seats. Each auditorium has a spacious stage, various lighting equipment, and neat seating, some of which are no less than cinemas. The Jilin Paper Mill auditorium is even more beautiful than some cinemas in the city. These auditoriums are called clubs, and they are equipped with management personnel, ranging from five or six to one or two. Most have their own film projectors, some of which are famous imports, worth twenty to thirty thousand yuan. Seven of these auditoriums are newly built, and two are renovated. A larger auditorium costs about 200,000 yuan to invest; a smaller auditorium costs about 100,000 yuan. In addition to these auditoriums, there are two cinemas operated by the local government. One is the Longtan Cinema, which is very large and can accommodate up to 1,800 people; the other is the Songhua River Cinema, which also has more than 1,000 seats.
	Are so many auditoriums urgently needed? We investigated the usage of each auditorium. Generally, they are idle more often than they are used. During the day, they are sometimes used to hold meetings, averaging only three or four times a month. In the evenings, they put on plays and show movies, averaging only a dozen or so screenings a month. The attendance rate for each show is not high, generally only reaching 60%-70%, and some even only reach 30%-40%. The Jilin Paper Mill auditorium has more screenings, but because the attendance rate is too low, it has lost more than 400 yuan this year. A factory auditorium in Longtan District shows only eight movies a month on average. The film projectors are naturally often idle.
	We also saw a strange phenomenon in the industrial area: on the one hand, the utilization rate of the auditoriums in each factory is not high; on the other hand, it is not convenient for the workers in the entire industrial area to watch plays and movies. What is the reason for this? The reason is that each factory builds its own auditorium, without much consideration for the overall needs. The existing auditoriums and cinemas are distributed extremely irrationally, with too many in some places and too few in others. The Hadawan workers' residential area has the Songhua River Cinema and the Jilin Paper Mill auditorium, which are not far apart. Both places show movies, resulting in a situation of competing for audiences. Because there are not many viewers, the attendance rate is very low. The auditoriums of other factories are mostly built near the factory buildings, which are far from the workers' residential areas. The auditoriums of each factory mainly serve the workers of their own factory and do not take much care of other factories. Therefore, these auditoriums cannot play a very good role. However, in the Tuchengzi residential area of Longtan District, with a population of more than 50,000, there is no cinema or auditorium. Workers in this residential area have to walk a long way to the Longtan Cinema to watch movies, and sometimes they cannot buy tickets, and even quarrels and fights occur. Recently, a unit built an auditorium here, but it can only meet the needs of the workers in its own unit.
	How to overcome the above shortcomings? We believe that the proper way should be: unified planning, unified investment, unified use, and unified management. There are many factories in the Jilin City industrial area, but they are not too far apart, and the workers' residential areas are relatively concentrated. They could have cooperated with each other and jointly built some cultural and welfare facilities. Why couldn't this be done in the past? The fundamental reason is that the investment in cultural and welfare facilities of each factory comes from various ministries of the central government, and no one else can interfere. A responsible comrade in Jilin City said well:
	"We want to interfere, but they say 'the central government has approved it,' how can we interfere?" These factories try every means to get a sum of money, and they all want to quickly build a decent auditorium for their own unit. In the Hadawan area, there are two factories belonging to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which are close to each other, and the residential areas are also close together. One of the factories has already built a large auditorium with 1,200 seats that can be used for performances, but it is not used much on weekdays. The other factory does not have an auditorium, and thinks it is inconvenient, so it spent 200 yuan to purchase the design drawings of the Songhua River Cinema and is preparing to build a beautiful auditorium. People want to ask: Why can't these two "brother factories" that are very close to each other share an auditorium? Why must each do its own thing? A factory in Longtan District also plans to build its own auditorium opposite the Longtan Cinema, and it is said that it will also show movies, preparing to compete with the Longtan Cinema. Another factory thinks that its auditorium is far from the residential area, so it is preparing to build a new auditorium. This trend of competing to build auditoriums has not been stopped so far. Recently, the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions also took out 350,000 yuan and planned to build a comprehensive cultural palace in the Longtan area; some local leaders are still very happy. These comrades did not consider: Will building this comprehensive cultural palace duplicate the factory auditoriums? Because two factories have already decided to build auditoriums like cinemas and theaters in the Longtan area. Such a practice of building auditoriums and cultural palaces in the same place, I don't know how much more state funds will be wasted! Many auditoriums with low utilization rates have been built in the past. Why are we still doing this now? Shouldn't we, according to the principle of "building the country with diligence and thrift," find ways to cooperate with each other and jointly organize some cultural and welfare undertakings, so as to save some funds for the country?
	People who disagree with jointly building cultural and entertainment venues say: "If we want to jointly build cultural and entertainment venues, and don't let us build our own auditoriums, then we have no place to hold meetings, and no place to carry out cultural and recreational activities. How can this work?" In fact, a factory does not hold meetings very often. Some meetings can be held in the workshops; if you must use the auditorium, you can also borrow public cultural and entertainment venues. Some people say: "It is too expensive and inconvenient to borrow public cultural and entertainment venues to hold meetings." This is indeed a difficulty. It is understood that some factories in the Longtan area, which do not have auditoriums, have to pay 120 yuan to borrow the Longtan Cinema for a meeting. Can this regulation be modified? We once visited the director of the Jilin City Cultural Bureau for this purpose. He said: If each unit invests jointly and builds a few cultural and entertainment venues in a unified manner, and everyone wants to borrow them for meetings, they can also negotiate with each other and formulate a system, without paying money or paying less money. This can be studied. Of course, doing so is naturally not as convenient as having your own auditorium. However, in order to save some money for the country, what is wrong with being a little inconvenient?
	As for whether the joint construction of cultural and entertainment venues by each unit will hinder the development of cultural and recreational activities of each unit? This will not be the case. On the contrary, with common cultural and entertainment venues, each unit can carry out cultural and recreational activities collectively. In this way, it can not only enrich everyone's cultural life, but also enhance the unity between the workers of each unit. In addition, each factory now has its own small game room, reading room, and dance hall. Some canteens can also dance. Some game rooms can even accommodate two or three hundred people. Guest houses also have auditoriums or game rooms. Each unit can fully utilize these cultural and entertainment venues to liven up cultural and recreational life. The saying that cultural and recreational activities cannot be done well without one's own auditorium is not well-founded.
	The situation with auditoriums is the same as that with health centers, guest houses, bathhouses, and kindergartens. It seems that it would be beneficial for each unit to study these issues during this rectification movement, based on the principle of "building the country with diligence and thrift."

### 每个工厂都要盖个大礼堂吗？

　　每个工厂都要盖个大礼堂吗？
　　本报记者　陈迹　温述仙
    我们在吉林市采访的日子里，看到新的工业区天天在变化，时时在成长，心中都充满了喜悦。三年前还是一片旷野的龙潭区，现在已是吉林肥料厂、吉林电石厂和吉林热电厂等新型工厂林立的地方。解放初期还很荒凉的哈达湾区，现在也变成了繁华的工业区。
    在我们看到这些巨大的建设成就的同时，也看到了一些在非生产性建设方面各搞一套、分散使用投资的浪费现象。
    我们在哈达湾和龙潭两个地区，看了七个工厂和两个建筑单位，发现它们各有一座大礼堂。这些大礼堂，很像是影剧院，多半能容纳一千多人。最大的，有一千三百多个座位；最小的，也有七百多个座位。每个大礼堂，都有宽敞的舞台、各种灯光设备和整齐的座位，有些设施并不亚于影剧院。吉林造纸厂大礼堂，比市区有些电影院还要漂亮一些。这些大礼堂，都被称做俱乐部，都配备了管理人员，多者五、六人，少者一、二人。大部分都有自己的电影放映机，有些还是著名的进口货，价值两、三万元。这些大礼堂，有七个是新建的，两个是改建的。一个较大的礼堂，投资总要二十万元左右；一个较小的礼堂，投资也得十万元左右。除了这些大礼堂而外，还有两座当地政府经营的电影院。一个是龙潭电影院，规模很大，最多能容纳一千八百人；一个是松花江电影院，也有一千多个座位。
    这么多大礼堂，是不是每一个都是迫切需要的呢？我们调查了各个大礼堂的使用情况。一般都是空闲的时候多，使用的时候少。白天，有时候用它来开大会，平均一个月不过三、四次。晚上演戏，放映电影，平均一个月只有十几场。每场的上座率也不高，一般只达到60％—70％，有的甚至只有30％—40％。吉林造纸厂大礼堂放映电影的场次多些，但是因为上座率过低，今年已赔本四百多元。龙潭区有个工厂的大礼堂，平均一个月只放映八场电影。电影放映机自然也常常闲着。
    我们在工业区还看到这样一种奇怪的现象：一方面，各厂的大礼堂使用率不高；另一方面，整个工业区的职工看戏、看电影又不够方便。这是什么道理呢？原因是各厂独自修建大礼堂，不大考虑整体的需要。现有的礼堂和电影院，分布极不合理，有的地方过多，有的地方过少。哈达湾职工住宅区，有松花江电影院，又有吉林造纸厂大礼堂，相隔没有多远。两处都要放映电影，结果形成互相争夺观众的局面。因为观众不多，上座率都很低。其他工厂的大礼堂，多半盖在工厂厂房附近，距离职工住宅区较远。各厂大礼堂，又主要为本厂职工服务，不大照顾外厂。因之，这些大礼堂都不能很好地发挥作用。但是，在龙潭区土城子住宅区，有五万多人口，却没有一所电影院和大礼堂。这个住宅区的职工们想看电影，要走很远的路，到龙潭电影院去，有时候还买不着票，甚至发生争吵、殴打等事件。最近，有个单位在这里建成了一座大礼堂，但也只能满足本单位职工的需要。
    怎么样克服上述缺点呢？我们认为，妥善的办法似乎应该是：统一规划，统一投资，统一使用，统一管理。吉林市工业区工厂很多，但是相隔都不太远，职工住宅区也比较集中，本来可以互相协作，共同搞一些文化福利设施。过去为什么不能这样做呢？根本原因在于，各厂的文化福利设施投资都来自中央各部，别的人谁也过问不了。吉林市有位负责同志说得好：
  “我们要想过问，但是人家说‘中央已经批准了’，我们怎么过问呀？”这些工厂想方设法弄到一笔资金，都恨不得赶快替本单位搞个像样的大礼堂。哈达湾地区有两个同属于冶金工业部的工厂，紧相毗邻，住宅区也靠在一起。其中有个工厂已经盖了一座能演戏的拥有一千二百个座位的大礼堂，平时使用的次数不多，另一个工厂，没有大礼堂，认为不方便，就花了二百元，购买了松花江电影院的设计图纸，准备修建一座漂亮的大礼堂。人们要问：这两个距离很近的“兄弟工厂”，为什么不能合用一个大礼堂呢？为什么一定要各搞一套呢？龙潭地区有个工厂还计划把自己的大礼堂修建在龙潭电影院的对面，据说也要放映电影，准备跟龙潭电影院唱个对台戏。另外有个工厂，嫌自己的大礼堂距离住宅区较远，就准备再盖个新的大礼堂。这种互相竞赛，争修大礼堂的风气，至今没有得到制止。最近吉林省工会还拿出三十五万元，计划在龙潭地区修建一座综合文化宫；当地有些领导人员还非常高兴。这些同志没有考虑：盖起这座综合文化宫，会不会又要同工厂大礼堂重复呢？因为现在已有两个工厂决定在龙潭地区新建像影剧院那样的大礼堂了。这种同在一地修建大礼堂、文化宫的做法，不知道又要浪费多少国家资金！过去搞了许多使用率不高的大礼堂，现在为什么还要这样搞呢？难道不应该根据“勤俭建国”的方针，设法互相协作，共同举办些文化福利事业，以便为国家节约些资金吗？
    不同意共同修建文化娱乐场所的人们说道：“如果要共同搞文化娱乐场所，不让我们自己搞大礼堂，那末我们没地方开大会，又没地方开展文娱活动，这怎么行得通呢？”事实上，一个工厂开大会的次数，是不会很多的。有些会可以在车间里开；如果一定要用大礼堂，也可以借用公共的文化娱乐场所。有人说：“借用公共的文化娱乐场所开大会，租钱太贵，又不大方便。”这确实是个困难。据了解，龙潭地区有些没有大礼堂的工厂，借龙潭电影院开一次大会，要付出一百二十元。这种规定，能不能修改呢？我们曾经为此拜访了吉林市文化局局长。他说：各单位共同投资，统一搞几个文化娱乐场所，大家要借用来开大会，也可以互相协商，订出制度，不付钱或者少付钱，这是可以研究的。当然，这样做起来，自然不如自己有大礼堂方便。但是，为了替国家节省些钱，稍有一点儿不方便，有何不可呢？
    至于各单位共同修建文化娱乐场所以后，是不是会妨害各单位文娱活动的开展呢？这是不会的。相反的是，各单位有了共同的文化娱乐场所，就可以集体地开展文娱活动。这样一来，既可以丰富大家的文化生活，又可以增进各单位职工之间的团结。另外，现在各厂还都有自己的小型游艺室、阅览室和跳舞厅。有些食堂，也能够跳舞。有些游艺室，甚至能容纳二、三百人。招待所也都有礼堂或者游艺室。各单位充分利用了这些文化娱乐场所，也可以活跃文娱生活。那种认为没有自己的大礼堂就不能搞好文娱活动的说法，是没有多大根据的。
    大礼堂是如此。卫生院、招待所、浴池和幼儿园等，也有类似情况。各单位在这次整风运动中，根据“勤俭建国”的方针，来研究一下这些问题，看来是不无好处的。
