China Democratic National Construction Association Holds Symposium

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association held a symposium on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss how to help the Communist Party in its rectification campaign. More than ten people attended, including Vice Chairman Huang Qixiang.

    Vice Chairman Huang Qixiang presided over the symposium.

    Li Boqiu said that the people's democratic dictatorship would not produce sectarianism; on the contrary, it would eliminate sectarianism.

    In his speech, Li Boqiu first mentioned that at many recent symposiums, representatives from various fields have expressed many opinions, including some completely different views. He believes that this symposium should address these contradictions in the debates. This would also be a way of helping the Communist Party's rectification campaign.

    Li Boqiu then criticized some of the erroneous views of Chu Anping and others. Chu Anping believes that the idea of "the party ruling the world" is the ultimate root of all sectarian phenomena. Chen Xingui's speech, published in today's Guangming Daily, goes a step further, arguing that the "root" of bureaucracy and sectarianism is the "proletarian dictatorship." He said that the system of the people's democratic dictatorship will not produce sectarianism; on the contrary, it will eliminate sectarianism. This system guarantees the development of socialist public ownership and also guarantees the development of the broadest democracy. He said that in the past, more than 500 million of China's 600 million people, including those present today, could not speak. To speak, one had to evade the surveillance and persecution of secret agents. After liberation, so many people could speak. Now, the situation has changed, and the leading party is advocating the implementation of broader democracy. Anyone, except for a few counter-revolutionaries, can speak out about any dissatisfaction. This is also to eradicate sectarianism.

    He said that some Communist Party members are sectarian; and that in the process of realizing the party's leadership, in some practices and specific measures, there are phenomena of the party substituting for the government. These should all be criticized and the Communist Party should be asked to correct them. However, one cannot therefore say that the Communist Party is the main camp of sectarianism, that it is "the party ruling the world"; nor can one therefore retreat from the people's democratic dictatorship to a coalition government of the working class, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie, let alone a bourgeois democracy.

    Yang Yitang believes that Zhang Yunchuan's speech that vilified activists was extremely inappropriate.

    Yang Yitang said in his speech that the democratic parties and the Communist Party are very close friends, and should be good friends to the Party. To help the Party rectify, one must be friendly and understanding (understand the purpose of rectification), friendly and direct (know everything and say everything), and friendly and well-informed (reflect the opinions heard and seen to the Communist Party).

    Then he talked about Zhang Yunchuan's speech at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on May 30. He said that Zhang Yunchuan felt that he was not being used to his full potential and was not recognized for his talents, so he found everything unpleasant. He said that Zhang Yunchuan used several stories in his speech, which was intentional. He believes that Zhang Yunchuan's comparison of activists to "Lord Tang" in the play "Trial Head and Stab Soup," with white powder on his nose, is extremely inappropriate. He believes that some activists may be a little "leftist," but this is for the sake of work. Then he said that Zhang Yunchuan said, "The love between Zhang Junrui and Yingying is considered a romantic affair because Zhang is a talented scholar and Cui is a beauty; if they were peddlers and vendors, they would be considered adultery. Many things are the same today, what someone does is right, but what someone else does is wrong." Yang Yitang said that the meaning of Zhang Yunchuan's reference to this story is actually to say that I am "Zhang Junrui," how can you treat me like a peddler? Yang Yitang said that Zhang Yunchuan's comparison of Lu Junyi and Li Kui is also the same, saying that Lu Junyi had no merit to Liangshanbo, so why should he be given the second position, while Li Kui was forgotten. Li Kui should be in the second position. Yang Yitang said that Zhang Yunchuan was comparing himself to "Li Kui".

    He said that there is also bureaucracy in the Ministry of Communications. There are three types: 1. Hardworking bureaucracy. The vice ministers and some directors of the Ministry of Communications (Party members) are very busy all day, but they are doing trivial things. 2. Careless and perfunctory bureaucracy. 3. Yes-man bureaucracy. He also talked about the subjectivism and sectarianism of the Ministry of Communications.

    Yan Xinmin spoke at the meeting and expressed different opinions on Zhang Yunchuan's speech at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department.

    Wang Jiyi also spoke at the meeting.

### 中国农工民主党举行座谈会

    中国农工民主党举行座谈会
    本报讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会于8日下午举行座谈会，讨论关于帮助共产党整风的问题。到会的有副主席黄琪翔等十多人。
    座谈会由黄琪翔副主席主持。
    李伯球说，人民民主专政不会产生宗派主义，恰恰会肃清宗派主义。
    李伯球在发言中首先提到，在最近举行的许多座谈会上，各方面的代表人物发表了很多意见，其中包括了一些完全不同的看法。他认为这次座谈会应该接触到争鸣中的这些矛盾。这样，对共产党的整风，也是一种帮助。
    李伯球接着批评了储安平等人的一些错误观点。储安平认为“党天下”的思想是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源。今天光明日报所载陈新桂的发言更进了一步，认为官僚主义和宗派主义的“根”是“无产阶级专政”。他说，人民民主专政的制度，是不会产生宗派主义的，恰恰相反，它是要肃清宗派主义的。这种制度保障社会主义公有制的发展，也保障开展最广泛的民主。他说，过去中国的六亿人，就有五亿多人，包括今天在座的人，都不能说话。想说话就要躲避特务的监视和迫害。解放后，这么多的人都能说话了。现在，形势有了变化，领导党就提倡实行更广泛的民主，除少数反革命分子外，任何人，有任何不满意的意见，都可以说。这也是为了铲除宗派主义。
    他说，有些共产党员是有宗派主义的；共产党在实现党的领导的时候，在某些作法上、某些具体措施中，也有以党代政的现象。这都应该提出批评，要求共产党改正。但是，不能因此说共产党是宗派主义的大本营，说是“党天下”；也不能因此就从人民民主专政退回到工人阶级、农民、小资产阶级、资产阶级联合的联合政府去，更不能来一个资产阶级的民主。
    杨逸棠认为，张云川丑化积极分子的发言是极不恰当的。
    杨逸棠发言说，民主党派和共产党是关系很深的朋友，要作党的益友。帮助党整风，要作到友谅（懂得整风的目的）、友直（知无不言、言无不尽）、友多闻（把听到和看到的意见反映给共产党）。
    接着他谈到张云川5月30日中共中央统战部召集的座谈会上的发言。他说，张云川觉得自己大材小用，怀才不遇，因此看什么也不顺眼。他说，张云川在发言中引了几个故事，是有用意的。他认为张云川把积极分子比作“审头刺汤”这出戏中的“汤老爷”，鼻子上给涂上白粉，是极不恰当的。他认为有的积极分子虽然“左”一点，但这是为了工作。接着他说，张云川说“张君瑞和莺莺的恋爱，因为张是才子，崔是佳人，就被认为是风流韵事；如果是贩夫走卒，就被认为是和奸通奸。今天许多事情都是如此，某人做是对的，某人做就不对。”杨逸棠说，张云川引这个故事的意思，实际是说，我是“张君瑞”，怎能拿我当贩夫走卒。杨逸棠说，张云川说的卢俊义和李逵的比较也是如此，是说卢俊义对梁山泊没有功劳，为什么让他坐第二把交椅，而把李逵忘了。李逵是应该坐第二把交椅的。杨逸棠说，张云川是把自己比做“李逵”的。
    他说，在交通部，官僚主义也有。有三种类型：一、辛辛苦苦的官僚主义。交通部的副部长、一些司局长（党员），整天都很忙，但做的是鸡毛蒜皮的事。二、马马虎虎、敷敷衍衍的官僚主义。三、唯唯否否的官僚主义。他也谈到交通部的主观主义和宗派主义。
    严信民在会上发言，他对张云川在统战部召开的座谈会上的发言，提出不同的意见。
    王寄一在会上也作了发言。
