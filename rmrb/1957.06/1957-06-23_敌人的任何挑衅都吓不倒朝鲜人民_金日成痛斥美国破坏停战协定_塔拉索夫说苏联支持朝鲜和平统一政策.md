Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - Kim Il Sung, Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, spoke at a banquet given by the Soviet Ambassador to North Korea, Puzanov, on the evening of the 21st for the visit of the Supreme Soviet delegation to North Korea, condemning the United States for undermining the armistice agreement.

Premier Kim Il Sung pointed out that in order to create tension in Korea, the U.S. imperialists openly announced that they would transport a large number of new weapons into southern Korea to strengthen their armed forces, and also moved the "United Nations Command" to Seoul. This is a gross violation of the armistice agreement.

Kim Il Sung said that the Syngman Rhee clique supports this aggressive action of the imperialists, attempting to use it to save its collapsing fate and re-ignite the civil war.

Kim Il Sung said, however, that no provocative act by the enemy can frighten the Korean people. This sinister plot will inevitably be met with unanimous and strong protests from the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world.

He said that for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Korean people resolutely advocate strictly abiding by the armistice agreement, turning the armistice into lasting peace, promptly convening a conference of countries concerned with the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and instead of transporting new weapons into Korea, withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and leaving the issue of Korea's reunification to the Korean people themselves. This is the only correct way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The Korean people, who are fully supported by the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will surely achieve victory in the struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Kim Il Sung said that the more rampant the enemy's provocative actions are, the more the Korean people will support and uphold the great Soviet Union, defend Marxism-Leninism, and they will continue to be loyal to proletarian internationalism.

Premier Kim Il Sung also expressed his support for the proposal recently put forward by the Soviet representative in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee.

Soviet Ambassador Puzanov and the head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, Tarasov, also spoke at the banquet. Tarasov praised the achievements made by the Korean people in the post-war reconstruction.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st - Tarasov, head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, said at a press conference here today that the Soviet Union supports the policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and the efforts made by the Republic's government in this regard will contribute to peace in the Far East and peace in the world.

This press conference was held after the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation conducted a fifteen-day visit to various parts of northern Korea.

Tarasov also said that the delegation talked with leaders such as Kim Il Sung, Kim Tu-bong, and Lee Young, as well as workers, farmers, and students in Korea, and visited many factories, mines, rural areas, and cultural facilities. They were excited and pleased to see the great achievements made by the Korean people in post-war economic construction and improving people's lives with the help of fraternal countries.

Tarasov said that the warm welcome of the delegation by the Korean people everywhere proves that the friendship and solidarity between the Soviet and Korean people are unbreakable.

　　敌人的任何挑衅都吓不倒朝鲜人民
    金日成痛斥美国破坏停战协定
    塔拉索夫说苏联支持朝鲜和平统一政策
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成21日晚上在苏联驻朝鲜大使普扎诺夫为苏联最高苏维埃代表团访问朝鲜举行的宴会上讲话，谴责美国破坏停战协定。
    金日成首相指出，美帝国主义者为了在朝鲜制造紧张局势，公然宣布要把大量的新型武器运入朝鲜南部，以加强他们的武装力量，还把“联合国军司令部”移到汉城。这就粗暴地违反了停战协定。
    金日成说，李承晚集团支持帝国主义者这一侵略行动，企图借此挽救自己的崩溃命运和再度挑起内战。
    金日成说，但是，敌人的任何挑衅行为都决不能吓倒朝鲜人民。这种凶恶的策划必将遭到朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一致的、强有力的抗议。
    他说，朝鲜人民为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，坚决主张始终不渝地严格遵守停战协定，把停战转变为持久和平，迅速召开同和平解决朝鲜问题有关国家的会议，不是把新型武器运入朝鲜，而是要把一切外国军队撤离朝鲜，把朝鲜的统一问题交给朝鲜人民自己来解决。这个途径是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一正确的途径。
    受到以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的全力支持的朝鲜人民，必将在实现祖国的和平统一的斗争中取得胜利。
    金日成说，敌人的挑衅行为越是猖狂，朝鲜人民越加支持和拥护伟大的苏联，捍卫马克思列宁主义，而且他们将要继续忠于无产阶级的国际主义。
    金日成首相在讲话中还表示支持苏联代表最近在联合国裁军小组委员会中提出的建议。
    苏联大使普扎诺夫和苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长塔拉索夫也在宴会上讲了话。塔拉索夫赞扬了朝鲜人民在战后的恢复建设中所取得的成就。
    新华社平壤21日电　苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长塔拉索夫今天在这里的记者招待会上说，苏联支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和平统一祖国的政策，共和国政府在这方面进行的努力将有助于远东和平和全世界的和平。
    这个记者招待会是苏联最高苏维埃代表团在朝鲜北部各地进行了十五天的访问以后举行的。
    塔拉索夫还说，代表团在朝鲜同金日成、金枓奉、李英等领导人和工人、农民、学生等进行了谈话，参观了许多工厂、矿山、农村和文化设施，看到了朝鲜人民在兄弟国家的援助下在战后经济建设和改善人民生活方面取得的巨大成就，感到兴奋和愉快。
    塔拉索夫说，各地的朝鲜人民对代表团的热烈欢迎，证明苏朝两国人民间的友谊团结是牢不可破的。
