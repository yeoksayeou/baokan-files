Do you agree with Mr. Ge Peiqi's statement that "If not for the Communist Party's leadership, people wouldn't betray the country?" I believe it is wrong. If not the Communist Party, who should lead? Should Chiang Kai-shek return to the mainland to rule the Chinese people, or should American imperialism lead us? I believe it is absolutely impossible for these reactionary groups to rule the Chinese people again, and our workers will absolutely not allow it, because we workers have suffered enough oppression and hardship from them in the past. During the Japanese imperialist era, we workers worked twelve hours a day, plus an additional ten to twenty consecutive shifts per month, working a total of forty to fifty days a month, amounting to four hundred and eighty to six hundred hours of work. Even with two people working, we couldn't support our families. We ate mixed flour, wore clothes that were patched and re-patched, and traitors and secret agents roamed everywhere. If we weren't careful at work or in our daily lives, and offended them, we risked being beaten, scolded, and even losing our lives. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang came, and prices rose three times a day. There was no guarantee for workers' lives, which was no different from the period when Japan ruled China, except that the name changed from Japan to the Kuomintang. During that period, only a small number of exploiting classes, such as landlords, bullies, traitors, secret agents, officials, and capitalists, could eat well and dress well. After liberation, our working class not only politically turned over but also greatly improved our lives. Every month, we can eat more than half of our food as white flour and fine grains, and we can eat meat three to four times. This is something we workers never dreamed of, and it is incomparable to any previous reactionary period. Some people say that living standards have not improved, but I think this only refers to those exploiting classes. The living standards of the vast majority of people have improved except for them. These facts show that I don't think it's possible without the leadership of the Communist Party. If someone truly violates the laws of social development and the wishes of the people, and does not want the Communist Party to lead the Chinese revolution, and insists on having Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, or the Kuomintang rule the Chinese people again, then we will have to pick up our axes and fight them to the death.

    不要共产党领导要谁领导编辑同志：
   “不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”，葛佩琦先生这句话对不对呢？我认为是不对的。不叫共产党领导叫谁来领导呢？叫蒋介石再回大陆统治中国人民，或者叫美帝国主义来领导？我认为叫这些反动集团来重新统治中国人民是绝不可能的，我们工人也是绝对不准许的，因为我们工人过去已经受尽它们的压迫，吃尽它们的苦头。日本帝国主义在时，我们工人每天工作十二个小时，另外每月还得打连班十天到二十天，全月上班四十个到五十个，合计工作四百八十个小时到六百个小时，昼夜工作连两口人之家都养活不了，吃的是混合面，穿的是补了又补的衣服，汉奸特务到处横行，上班及日常生活当中一不小心，得罪了他们就有挨打受骂及性命之危险。日本投降以后，国民党来了，物价一日三涨，工人生活毫无保证，给日本统治中国时期没有任何区别，只是在名称上由日本换了个国民党而已。在那个时期，吃得饱的，穿的好的，只有地主恶霸，汉奸、特务，官僚和资本家少数的剥削阶级。解放后我们工人阶级不但在政治上翻了身，在生活上也有很大的提高，每个月能够吃到一半以上的白面细粮，能够吃上三次到四次的肉，这是我们工人作梦也想不到的事情，也是过去任何反动时期所比不上的。有人说现在生活没有提高，我想也不过是指的那些剥削阶级而已。除他们以外绝大部分人民的生活水平是提高了。从以上这些事实说明，没有共产党的领导我认为是不行的。如果确实有人违背社会发展规律和人民的愿望，不要共产党领导中国革命，硬要日本帝国主义、美帝国主义或国民党来重新统治中国人民，那我们只有拿起斧头给他们拚命。
