    Receiving Abuse Before Even Seeing the Play
    One day, I went to the Experimental Theater to buy tickets for a play, but the ticket window was closed, even though it was their designated ticket selling time. I knocked on the window. Someone inside asked sternly, "What do you want??"
    I explained my purpose.
    "Sold out!"
    "If it's sold out, why not put up a notice to say so?"
    "None of your business!"
    "What about tomorrow's show, are there any tickets?"
    "No!"
    "What about the day after tomorrow?"
    No answer.
    It's not just this one time I've been rebuffed. At other theaters and opera houses, some ticket sellers also have very fierce attitudes. When you ask them about the performance time or ticket price, they answer you impatiently. If you want to choose a seat, they won't let you choose properly, and keep urging you to buy quickly.
    It's as if we're not going to spend money to see a play, but rather to exploit these comrades. Otherwise, why are these people's faces so unpleasant? (Beijing, Jia Cun)

    未曾看戏先受气
    有一天我到实验剧场去买话剧票，售票窗口关着，虽然是他们的售票时间。我敲了窗子。里边有个人厉声问道：“干?？”
    我说明了我的来意。
    “卖完了！”
    “卖完，怎么不贴个条子说明一下呢？”
    “你管不着！”
    “明天的，有没有？”
    “没有！”
    “后天的呢？”
    听不见回答。
    我并不是只碰过这么一次钉子。其它的一些剧场、戏院，有些售票员态度也是很凶狠的，你问他开演时间，票价，他都是不耐烦地回答你，你想挑个座位，他不好好让你挑，一个劲儿催你快买。
    我们好像不是去花钱看戏，而是去剥削这些同志似的。不然，为什么这些人的面孔，都是那么难看呢？　（北京　贾村）
