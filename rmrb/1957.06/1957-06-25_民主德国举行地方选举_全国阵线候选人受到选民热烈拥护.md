Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 24th (By our correspondent Liu Guiliang) The usual Sunday silence was broken today in cities and villages, large and small, throughout the German Democratic Republic. Everywhere was as lively as a festival. From morning till night, about ten million voters across the country flocked to local polling stations to enthusiastically vote for a total of approximately 250,000 representatives to county, city, district, township, and town level local councils.

As of 8:00 PM (Central European Time) on the 23rd, when voting ended, preliminary estimates indicated that voter participation in various locations generally exceeded 94%.

The election results will be announced on the 24th. It is expected that the candidates on the National Front's joint list will achieve an overwhelming victory. Within two weeks after the announcement of the election results, the new local councils at all levels will be formed and will elect new local governments.

This reporter visited several districts belonging to Greater Berlin and the voting situation in the two cities of Potsdam and Brandenburg. In these places, voters began arriving at the polling stations from as early as 5:00 AM to wait to vote, causing many polling stations to have to advance the scheduled start time for voting by half an hour to an hour.

Male and female citizens who had just turned eighteen years old were participating in the election for the first time in their lives. Such young voters account for almost one-tenth of the national electorate. These young people appeared somewhat excited as they walked past the ballot box. When you ask them if they support the candidates of the National Front, they immediately tell you: Why wouldn't we? For peace, for socialism, and against West Germany's atomic war policy, how could we not vote for the candidates of the National Front?

Workers and farmers said that their living standards have significantly improved in recent years. In order to enable every family to live a peaceful and happy life, they firmly support the political power of their own workers and peasants.

According to Henkel, the secretary of the National Front in Potsdam, who announced at a press conference, 8,000 voters in the city who had pre-registered to be out of town on business today had already voted at a specially set up polling station the day before the election. 96% of these voters supported the candidates on the National Front's joint list.

　　民主德国举行地方选举
    全国阵线候选人受到选民热烈拥护
    新华社柏林24日电　本社记者刘桂梁报道：民主德国大小城市和乡村今天打破了星期日惯常的沉寂。各地都像过节一样的热闹。全国约一千万选民从早到晚络绎不绝地到当地的选举站踊跃投票，选举县、市、区、乡、镇各级地方议会总数约二十五万的议员。
    截至23日晚二十点（中欧时间）投票结束时止，据初步估计，各地参加投票的选民一般都在94％以上。
    选举结果将在24日揭晓。预料全国阵线联合名单上的候选人将获得压倒优势的胜利。在选举结果揭晓后两星期内，新的各级地方议会将组成，并将选出新的地方政府。
    记者参观了大柏林市所属几个区和波茨坦、勃兰登堡两个市的投票情况。这些地方的选民从清晨五点多钟起就到选举站等待着投票，致使许多选举站不得不把预定的开始投票时间提前半小时到一小时。
    刚满十八岁的男女公民今天是他们有生以来第一次参加选举，这样的青年选民几乎占全国选民的十分之一。这些年轻人在走过票箱时看来有些激动，当你问他们是否拥护全国阵线的候选人时，他们立刻告诉你：为什么不？为了和平，为了社会主义，为了反对西德的原子战争政策，我们怎能不选全国阵线的候选人？
    工人和农民说，几年来他们的生活水平有了显著的提高。为了使每一个家庭都能过和平幸福的生活，他们坚决支持工农自己的政权。
    据波茨坦市全国阵线书记亨克尔在记者招待会上宣布，这个市事前登记要在今天因事外出的八千名选民，已经在选举日的前一天在一个特别设置的选举处投了票。这部分选民的96％投票支持全国阵线联合名单上的候选人。
