Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) held its 39th Standing Committee meeting tonight, passing a resolution to launch a rectification campaign within the CDNCA and exposing and criticizing Zhang Naiqi's recent persistent errors.

The rectification decision stated that the central requirement of this rectification campaign should be to ensure that all levels of organizations and all members can resolve the issue of adhering to the socialist path and opposing the capitalist path in their understanding and actions. The specific content is to examine the understanding and actions in the following three aspects: (1) Regarding the leadership of the working class and the leadership of the Party; (2) Regarding the socialist system; (3) Regarding ideological remolding.

Zhu Deqin, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CDNCA Central Committee, and Xu Hansan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda and Education Department, said at the meeting that when they visited Zhang Naiqi on the 20th, Zhang Naiqi still persisted in his errors. He said that the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) wanted him to conduct a self-criticism, but he only had counter-criticisms. He also expressed that he no longer wanted to serve as the Vice Chairman of the CDNCA and the ACFIC and hoped that the two organizations would expel him from membership. He also wanted to request the State Council to examine all his speeches and actions, and if they were anti-socialist, he requested to be removed from his post as Minister of Food. As for the position of Deputy to the National People's Congress, there was no need to nominate him when the election was held next year.

Zhang Naiqi also said to them, what is wrong with saying that the working class is the advanced class and the bourgeoisie is the backward class? Do we have to say that the bourgeoisie is the reactionary class?

Xu Hansan said that when they asked Zhang Naiqi what he thought after reading Chairman Mao's recently published article, Zhang Naiqi said that his remarks might have been incorrect, but they did not deviate from the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao.

At tonight's meeting, more than a dozen Standing Committee members spoke and criticized Zhang Naiqi. Wu Dakun, Hu Ziying, Wu Juenong, Huang Liangchen and others exposed Zhang Naiqi's ugly words and deeds before liberation.

Wu Dakun said: Zhang Naiqi started his career by participating in the National Salvation Movement before the War of Resistance Against Japan and becoming one of the "Seven Gentlemen." The reason why he participated in the National Salvation Association was to obtain political capital as a stepping stone for his personal development.

Wu Dakun said that when Zhang Naiqi held a leading position in the National Salvation Association, he had close contacts with Song Ziwen, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and others. During the process of being arrested by the Kuomintang government, he asked Wu Dakun to write articles for him, promoting his talents in order to gain the appreciation of the Kuomintang. After he was released from prison, he published an article entitled "Less Appeals, More Suggestions." The so-called less appeals meant less appeals to the masses to participate in the national salvation movement, and more suggestions meant acting as an advisor to the Kuomintang government. At that time, Zou Taofen was very angry when he learned of his behavior and expelled him from the National Salvation Association. Later, he went to Anhui Province and became the Secretary-General and Director of Finance of the puppet provincial government, and later became a central officer of the Three People's Principles Youth League.

Hu Ziying revealed that after Zhang Naiqi was released from prison, he organized a new recruits service center and also engaged in some economic activities, frequently courting the Kuomintang government. She also said that she left home to petition the Kuomintang government in Nanjing during the national salvation movement and was severely rebuked by Zhang Naiqi. At that time, Zhang Naiqi found it inconvenient to explicitly prevent her from participating in patriotic activities, so he pushed all the housework to her, holding her back.

Wu Juenong said that when he contacted Zhang Naiqi between 1939 and 1940, he heard Zhang Naiqi say that there were only two people in China who understood dialectics, one was Mao Zedong and the other was Chiang Kai-shek, which shows that he admired Chiang Kai-shek very much. He also heard him scold Shen Junru, saying, "This old fellow is still not enlightened and is still involved with the Communist Party." The speakers were very angry at Zhang Naiqi's stubborn and incorrigible attitude, and they all demanded that the CDNCA specifically collect Zhang Naiqi's past reactionary activities in order to more thoroughly criticize him. This meeting accepted everyone's request and established a special team to carry out this work.

### 揭露章乃器背叛救国会追随国民党的丑史

　　民建中央通过整风决定  常委会上展开尖锐批评
　　揭露章乃器背叛救国会追随国民党的丑史
    章乃器坚持错误，拒绝检讨，并且要挟威胁，要民建和工商联开除他的会籍；要国务院检查他的言行，如果是反社会主义的，就解除他粮食部部长的职务；还提出明年选举全国人民代表大会代表时，不必提他的名。
      新华社25日讯  中国民主建国会中央常委会今天晚上举行第三十九次会议，通过在民主建国会内开展整风的决定，并揭露和批判了章乃器最近坚持错误的态度。
      整风决定中说，这次会的整风，应当以各级组织和全体会员在认识上、行动上都能够解决坚持走社会主义道路、反对走资本主义道路的问题为中心要求。具体内容则为检查以下三个方面的认识和行动：（1）对工人阶级的领导和党的领导方面；（2）对社会主义制度方面；（3）对思想改造方面。
    民建中央常委会组织处副处长朱德禽和宣教处副处长许汉三，在会上说他们在20日去看望章乃器的时候，章乃器仍旧坚持错误，他说民建和工商联要他检讨，而他只有反批评，并且表示不想担任民主建国会和全国工商联副主任委员的职务了，希望两会开除他的会籍。他还想请求国务院检查他的全部言论和行动，如果是反社会主义的，就请解除他粮食部部长的职务。至于全国人民代表大会代表的职务，在明年举行选举的时候，就不必提他的名了。
    章乃器还对他们说，讲工人阶级是先进阶级，资产阶级是落后阶级，有什么不好呢？难道一定要说资产阶级是反动阶级吗？
    许汉三说，当他们问到章乃器看了毛主席最近发表的文章后有何感想时，章乃器说他的言论可能有不对的地方，但同毛主席提出的六项标准没有出入。
    在今晚的会议上，有十几位常务委员发言批评了章乃器。吴大琨、胡子婴、吴觉农、黄凉尘等人，揭露了章乃器在解放以前的丑恶言行。
    吴大琨说：章乃器是在抗日战争前参加救国运动而成为“七君子”之一起家的，他之所以参加救国会是为了取得政治资本，作为他个人发展的垫脚石。
    吴大琨说，章乃器在担任救国联合会领导职务的时候，同宋子文、李宗仁、白崇禧等人有密切联系。他在被国民党政府逮捕的过程中，曾要吴大琨为他写文章，宣扬他的才能，以求取得国民党的赏识。他出狱后，发表了一篇题为“少号召，多建议”的文章，所谓少号召就是少号召群众参加救亡运动，多建议就是作为国民党政府的参谋者。当时邹韬奋知道他的这种行径后非常气愤，开除了他救国会会籍。以后他到安徽省当了伪省政府的秘书长兼财政厅长，以后又当了三民主义青年团的中央干事。
    胡子婴揭露章乃器在出狱后，曾组织过新兵服务所，在经济上也进行了一些活动，向国民党政府频送秋波。她还说她在救亡运动中曾离家去南京向国民党政府请愿，受到章乃器严厉的责备。当时章乃器不便明白阻止她参加爱国活动，就把一切家务事都推给她做，拖住她的后腿。
    吴觉农说他在1939年到1940年间同章乃器接触的时候，曾听章乃器说过中国只有两个人懂辩证法，一是毛泽东，一是蒋介石，这说明他对蒋介石是非常钦佩的。还听到他骂沈钧儒说“这个老家伙还不觉悟，还同共产党搞在一起。”发言的人对章乃器坚持错误的顽固不化的态度非常气愤，都要求民主建国会专门搜集章乃器历来的反动活动，以便更彻底地批判他，这次会议接受大家的要求，成立一个专门小组进行这项工作。
