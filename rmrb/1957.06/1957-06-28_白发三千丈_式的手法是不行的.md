"White Hair Three Thousand Zhang" style techniques are not acceptable
Zhang Zige, Professor of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, Chongqing, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang
    Non-Party members helping the Communist Party with rectification and resolving internal contradictions among the people is a major event in our country's political life proposed by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country. This once again demonstrates the correctness and brilliance of the Communist Party's leadership and the sincere support of the people for the Communist Party.
    Everyone must first affirm that this is under the leadership of the Communist Party, starting from the desire for unity, to achieve new unity, in order to better build our socialism. All practices that violate this principle are unhealthy, but recently, many erroneous statements have appeared in various aspects, especially among senior intellectuals. As a non-Party senior intellectual, and as a professor who has been serving in higher education since before and after liberation, I cannot but oppose these phenomena.
    First of all, I firmly oppose the absurd remarks of people like Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping. They oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, oppose socialism, and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. These are reactionary remarks against the constitution, originating from a fundamentally different class position. We must fundamentally clarify this point and draw a clear line with them. I am a member of a democratic party, therefore, I especially want to protest against Chu Anping for using his position as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily to oppose socialism. He harbors an attitude of fearing that the world will not be in chaos. Since the "blooming and contending," the selection criteria of Guangming Daily have been to strive for intensity, dissatisfaction, and complaints. I wrote a more constructive article discussing the internal contradictions of universities and sent it to Guangming Daily, but it was returned because it was too out of line with Chu Anping's tastes. I suggest that the leadership of Guangming Daily should deal with Chu Anping's problem in a timely manner, and not let him continue to use his position as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily to carry out activities against socialism and against the leadership of the Party.
    It is worth noting that their kind of ulterior remarks also exist in Chongqing. Li Youlin, a professor at Southwest Agricultural College, publicly said at a forum held by the school on June 6: "If the Communist Party Central Committee does not change its policies, I will support the Third Party to come to power." This shows that in this movement, we must not ignore class struggle. Due vigilance and counterattacks should be given to those anti-socialist remarks. Our national system, our socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, is a fundamental issue that we have already resolved, which has been unanimously approved by our 600 million people and fixed in the Constitution through legislative procedures. This is the collective will of the 600 million people. Whoever opposes this point, he factually shows that he opposes the Chinese people, and we have reason and must regard him as a class enemy.
    Some people inevitably talk about problems in a one-sided and unrealistic way. For example, when talking about the shortcomings of past movements, they completely deny the significant significance of those movements. When talking about the characteristics of Chinese intellectuals, they forget our shortcomings and only emphasize our "being promising and principled," "hard bones," "scholars do not go out, but know the world's affairs," and other lofty and talented qualities. This just exposes that if our intellectuals do not have the leadership and education of the Party, there is a danger of returning to the old gentry's face. We are by no means today's Zhuge Liang, we still greatly need transformation. The intellectuals of Southwest University of Political Science and Law almost all oppose professor-led schools. People have said: "If Professor × were to run the school, it would be a hundred times more bureaucratic than the current Party committee." Is ideological remolding as fruitless as some people say? If we do not carry out the ideological remolding movement, we will not be able to draw clear ideological boundaries, and it is impossible to recognize the truth of following the working class on the socialist road. The problems left over from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and ideological remolding should be resolved. Helping the Party summarize the mistakes made by Party members in these movements, so as to improve work in the future, is correct. But we cannot therefore obliterate the role of the movement.
    Is sectarianism present? Yes, we non-Party members should help the Party and fight against it. However, we cannot demand that the Communist Party abandon its leadership because of anti-sectarianism, demand that non-Party members compete with the Communist Party in leading the work of various departments of the state, and implement bourgeois democracy. For example, it is right that the arrangement of school teachers should solicit the opinions of veteran teachers. As for someone completely denying the work of the personnel department, and even fundamentally opposing the confidentiality system in personnel matters, then that has gone astray. We are still surrounded by imperialism, and there are still remnants of counter-revolutionaries in the country. It is not acceptable to ask the Communist Party to open everything up, that would be giving the enemy a great convenience. In short, we are talking about politics here, we must be realistic, and using the literary exaggeration habit of intellectuals, coming up with a literary exaggeration technique like "white hair three thousand zhang" at every turn is not acceptable.
    Now there is also an atmosphere of hitting people with a stick. Some comrades only like to say bad things about Party leaders, and don't like to say good things. For many old cadres who once risked their lives and contributed their youth to the revolution, they are completely denied, with no merits, and some people even demand that the leaders pack their bags and leave at every turn. I think this is an unhealthy mood. Just think about it, the old intellectuals had so many problems, and some had served the reactionaries for a long time, but during ideological remolding, the Communists never said that they would kick these people away. I suggest that non-Party members should learn more from the Communist Party's spirit of treating people with kindness. Opinions may be very sharp, but a constructive and comradely attitude should be adopted. Also, one's own opinions should not be regarded as conclusions or truths. Room for discussion and debate should be allowed. In order to achieve new unity, I hope that these comrades will always consider the most basic requirement of "starting from the desire for unity."

### “白发三千丈”式的手法是不行的

　　“白发三千丈”式的手法是不行的
　　重庆西南政法学院教授、民革党员  张紫葛
    党外人士帮助共产党整风，解决人民内部矛盾，这是共产党和毛主席提出来，全国人民热烈响应的我国政治生活上的一件大事。这里再一次地显示了共产党领导的正确英明和全国人民对共产党的衷心拥护。
    任何人都必须首先肯定，这是在共产党领导之下，从团结的愿望出发，来达到新的团结，以便更好地建设我们的社会主义。一切违背这一原则的作法都是不健康的，但是近来，各方面、特别是高级知识分子之中，却出现了不少错误言论。我作为一个党外的高级知识分子，作为解放前后一直在高等教育界服务的教授，不能不反对这些现象。
    首先，我坚决反对葛佩琦、储安平一类人的荒谬言论。他们反对人民民主专政、反对社会主义、反对共产党的领导。这是反对宪法的反动言论，是从一种根本不同的阶级立场出发的言论。我们必须根本弄清这一点，同他们划清界限。我是一个民主党派的成员，因此，特别要抗议储安平利用光明日报总编辑的地位来反对社会主义。他抱有惟恐天下不乱的态度。自从“鸣、放”以来，光明日报的选稿条件就是力求激烈、不满、牢骚。我写了一篇建设性较强的讨论高等学校的内部矛盾的文章，寄到光明日报，就因为太不合乎储安平的胃口而被退回。我建议，光明日报的领导应该及时处理储安平的问题，不能让他继续利用光明日报总编辑的地位，进行反对社会主义、反对党的领导的活动。
    值得注意的是，他们这种别有用心的言论，在重庆也有。西南农学院的教授李友霖在6月6日该校所举行的座谈会上公然说：“共产党中央不改变政策，我就拥护第三党出来执政。”这就说明，在这次运动中，我们决不能忽略阶级斗争。对于那些反社会主义的言论应该予以应有的警惕和回击。我们的国家制度，我们在共产党领导之下走社会主义道路的这个根本问题，是我们早已解决了的，是我们六亿人民一致通过并在宪法上以立法手续固定下来了的。这是六亿人民的集体意志。谁要反对这一点，他就以事实说明了他反对中国人民，我们就有理由而且必须把他看作阶级敌对分子。
    有一些人谈问题时不免片面和不实事求是。例如，谈到历次运动中的缺点时就全盘地否定那些运动的重大意义。谈到中国知识分子的特点时就忘掉了我们的缺点，一味强调我们的“有为有守”、“硬骨头”、“秀才不出门、能知天下事”等等清高和才华。这里就正好暴露了我们知识分子如果没有党的领导和教育，就有回复到旧时士大夫面目的危险。我们决不是今天的诸葛亮，我们还大大地需要改造。西南政法学院的知识分子就几乎全部反对教授治校，人们纷纷说：“如果让×大教授治校，保险比现在的党委官僚主义多一百倍。”思想改造是不是像某些人所说的毫无成绩呢？如果不进行思想改造运动，我们就划不清思想界限，不可能认清跟着工人阶级走社会主义道路的道理。肃反、思想改造时所遗留下来的问题应该解决。帮助党总结党员们在这些运动中所犯的错误，以便今后改进工作，这是对的。但不能因此就一笔抹煞运动的作用。
    宗派主义是不是有呢？有的，我们党外人士应该帮助党和它进行斗争。但是不能因为反宗派主义就要求共产党放弃领导，要求党外人士在领导国家各部门工作之中和共产党分庭抗礼，实行资产阶级民主。譬如说，学校教员的安排应该征求老教师的意见，这是对的。至于有人全面否定人事部门的工作，甚至根本反对人事上的保密制度，那就走了偏风了。我们还受帝国主义的包围，国内还有反革命分子的残余。要求共产党一切都敞开门是不行的，那就是给敌人大开方便之门，总之，我们这是谈政治，这里必须实事求是，用文人的夸大习惯，动不动来一个“白发三千丈”似的文学夸张手法是不行的。
    现在提意见的人又有一种一棍子打死的气氛。有些同志们对于党内领导人只喜说坏，不喜说好。对于很多曾经出死入生、为革命贡献过青春的老干部一口否定，毫无是处，甚至有人动辄要求领导卷行李走路。我认为这是一种不健康的情绪。只要想一下，旧知识分子那样多毛病，有的曾经长期地为反动派服务，可是在思想改造的时候，共产党人从来也没有说要把这些人一脚踢开。我建议党外人士多多学习共产党人与人为善的精神。意见不妨十分尖锐，但要采取建设性的同志式的态度。也不能把自己的意见当定论，当真理。要容许商讨和辩论。为了达到新的团结，我希望这些同志们随时考虑到“从团结的愿望出发”这个最基本的要求。
