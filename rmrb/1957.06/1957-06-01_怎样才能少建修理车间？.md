Chemical Industry Department designers held a forum to discuss the editorial published in this newspaper, "Pay Attention to Organizing Collaboration Between Enterprises in Construction," and the article "Fewer Repair Workshops Can Be Built," believing that overcoming departmentalism is the ideological basis for strengthening collaboration and rationally arranging and utilizing repair workshops.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The editorial "Pay Attention to Organizing Collaboration Between Enterprises in Construction" and the article "Fewer Repair Workshops Can Be Built," published in this newspaper on May 21st and 22nd respectively, proposed that within an industrial area, repair workshops should be rationally constructed and utilized through collaboration between enterprises, and suggested building central repair plants to save construction funds. This opinion has been valued by the technical personnel of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Design Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and a special symposium was held on May 25 to discuss this issue.

    Technical personnel from the State Construction Commission's Heavy Industry Bureau, the Ministry of Chemical Industry's Organic Chemical Industry Design Institute, Basic Chemical Industry Design Institute, Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Design Institute, Sichuan Fertilizer Plant, Lanzhou Rubber Plant, Zhuzhou Chemical Plant, and other units participated in the symposium. The attendees spoke enthusiastically, demonstrating their zeal for building the country through diligence and thrift.

    Those present agreed that strengthening collaboration between ministries and enterprises, rationally utilizing existing repair workshops in various enterprises within a system or industrial area, and more rationally planning and constructing new repair workshops is an important aspect of overcoming waste in industrial construction. Everyone agreed that it is still necessary for each production enterprise to have a repair workshop to promptly overhaul production equipment and ensure the smooth progress of production. However, the scale of this repair workshop should not be too large, and its production capacity can be controlled within the scope of repair, and the spare parts required for repair can be completed through collaboration. In the past, the repair workshops of many enterprises were built too large, and they were often "underfed," which resulted in great waste. Now, China's industrial base has been basically formed, the planning work of industrial construction has been improved, and the experience in organizing collaboration is also richer than in the past, so there are conditions to solve the problems in this regard.

    However, those present also pointed out that although there are many favorable conditions, if we want to solve the problem of rationally arranging and utilizing the capacity of repair workshops, we must focus on opposing the ideology of departmentalism. For example, some enterprises only seek convenience for their own units, dislike the trouble of organizing collaboration, and still want to "not ask anyone for anything" or "not be asked by anyone for anything," etc. Overcoming departmentalism and strengthening ideological education on building the country through diligence and thrift is the ideological basis for overcoming waste in the construction of repair workshops, otherwise it will be impossible to prevent waste in this regard. For example, the technical design of the Lanzhou Rubber Plant's machine repair workshop originally stipulated that a foundry section could not be built, and all casting tasks could be entrusted to the foundry section of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant's machine repair workshop, because the capacity of the fertilizer plant's foundry section was very large and could take over the rubber plant's casting tasks. However, on April 30 this year, the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry notified the Lanzhou Rubber Plant to add a foundry section to the machine repair workshop, mainly because it overemphasized certain difficulties in collaboration. Now, the chief designers of the above two factories have jointly written a report, suggesting that the Ministry of Chemical Industry abolish the design project of the foundry section of the rubber plant's machine repair workshop. Such non-cooperative phenomena between the Lanzhou Rubber Plant and the Fertilizer Plant are not isolated cases between ministries and enterprises, and it is impossible to organize collaboration without overcoming this phenomenon.

    Regarding the issue of how to establish repair workshops in the future, there were three opinions at the meeting. First, in an industrial area, in addition to each enterprise establishing a small-scale repair workshop, a central repair plant of considerable scale should be established to directly serve the maintenance work of enterprises in this area and provide these factories with the spare parts needed for maintenance. This central repair plant should be led by the local government to avoid departmentalism due to belonging to any one system; second, in an area with few enterprises, the larger repair workshop of a certain enterprise should be the main body, and collaboration should be organized, but everyone is very worried about whether this enterprise can fairly arrange the repair tasks of other factories; third, according to the needs of the same type of enterprises under a certain ministry for certain special and large-scale equipment, a repair plant should be established to supply this equipment. Such repair plants can transcend the scope of a region and serve the maintenance work of enterprises in a wider area. As for which of these three methods is better, no specific comparison has been made due to the lack of experience, but everyone believes that this issue should be studied quickly.

    At the meeting, everyone also actively put forward suggestions to the leading organs. The suggestion to the State Construction Commission is: it should start to comprehensively study this issue, especially consider how various industrial departments in a region should collaborate, and these issues cannot be solved by any one ministry or any one design institute. At the same time, a working group should be immediately organized to go to certain industrial bases (such as Lanzhou) to check the situation in this regard. Because some enterprises in some areas have already built large repair workshops, while other enterprises are still planning or are beginning to build large repair workshops. If this practice is not corrected immediately, the phenomenon of waste will continue. The suggestion to the Ministry of Chemical Industry is: in addition to leading relevant departments to study this issue, it is necessary to take decisive measures to stop the unreasonable suggestions of certain enterprises of the Ministry, such as the machine repair workshop foundry section that the Lanzhou Rubber Plant is planning to build.

    怎样才能少建修理车间？
    化学工业部设计人员座谈，讨论本报发表的“在建设中要注意组织企业之间的协作”的社论和“可以少建修理车间”的文章，认为克服本位主义是加强协作、合理安排、使用修理车间的思想基础。
    本报讯　本报5月21、22日先后发表的“在建设中要注意组织企业之间的协作”的社论、“可以少建修理车间”的文章里，曾提出在一个工业地区里，通过企业间的协作，合理地建设、利用修理车间，建议建设中心修理厂，以节约建设资金。这个意见引起了化学工业部氮肥设计院技术人员们的重视，于5月25日专门召开座谈会讨论了这个问题。
    参加这次座谈会的有国家建设委员会重工业局、化学工业部有机化学工业设计院、基本化学工业设计院、氮肥工业设计院、四川肥料厂、兰州橡胶厂、株州化工厂等单位的技术人员。到会的人，发言很热烈，表现了勤俭建国的热情。
    到会的人都同意加强部与部、企业与企业间的协作，在一个系统内或一个工业地区内，合理地使用各企业已有的修理车间，更合理地规划、建设新的修理车间，认为这是克服工业建设中浪费的一个重要的方面。大家认为各生产企业有一个修理车间还是必要的，能及时检修生产设备，保证生产顺利进行。但是，这个修理车间的规模不宜太大，可以把生产能力控制在修理范围以内，把修理时所需用的备件通过协作去完成。过去，有不少企业的修理车间建的大了，时常“吃不饱”，其中有很大的浪费。现在，我国的工业基地已基本上形成，工业建设的计划工作已有所提高，组织协作的经验也比过去丰富，就有条件来解决这方面存在的问题。
    但是，到会的人也指出，虽然有不少有利条件，要想解决合理安排、使用修理车间能力的问题，必须着重反对本位主义的思想，如有些企业只图自己单位的方便、嫌组织协作麻烦，仍然想“万事不求人”或“万事不被人求”等。克服本位主义、加强勤俭建国的思想教育，是克服建设修理车间时浪费的思想基础，否则就无法杜绝这方面的浪费。例如，兰州橡胶厂机修车间技术设计原规定可以不建铸工工段，全部铸造任务可以委托给兰州肥料厂机修车间铸工工段做，因为肥料厂铸工工段的能力很大，可以把橡胶厂的铸工任务包下来。然而在今年4月30日，化工部有机化学工业管理局却通知兰州橡胶厂增建机修车间铸工工段，其原因主要是过分强调了协作方面的某些困难。现在，上述两个厂的设计总负责人已联合写了报告，建议化学工业部撤销橡胶厂机修车间铸工工段这个设计项目。像兰州橡胶厂、肥料厂这种不积极协作的现象，在部与部、企业与企业之间不是个别的，不克服这种现象，是无法组织协作的。
    对于今后如何建立修理车间的问题，会上有三种意见。第一，在一个工业区内，除各企业自己建立规模较小的修理车间外，再建立一个相当规模的中心修理厂，直接为这个地区企业的检修工作服务，为这些厂提供检修所需要的备件。这个中心修理厂应由地方上领导，免得属于任何一个系统而发生本位主义现象；第二，在一个企业不多的地区内，以某个企业较大的修理车间为主，组织协作，但是，大家很担心这个企业能不能公平地安排其他厂的修理任务；第三，根据一个部的同类型企业对某几种特殊的、大型的设备的需要，建立一个供应这种设备的修理厂，这样的修理厂，可以超越一个地区的范围，为更广大地区的企业的检修工作服务。至于这三种方法那一种好，因目前没有经验，所以没有加以具体的比较，但大家认为这个问题是应该迅速加以研究的。
    在会上，大家还积极向领导机关提出了建议。对国家建设委员会的建议是：应该着手全面地研究这个问题，特别是考虑一个地区内各工业部门之间如何协作，而这些问题绝不是那一个部、那一个设计院可以解决的。同时，还应该立即组织工作组到某些工业基地（如兰州）去，检查这方面的情况。因为，现在还有些地区一些企业已建了大的修理车间，而另一些企业依然正计划或正开始建设大的修理车间，如不马上纠正这种做法，浪费的现象还会继续下去。对化学工业部的建议是：除了领导有关部门研究这个问题外，需要采取果断的措施，停止本部某些企业不合理的建议，如兰州橡胶厂正在计划建设的机修车间铸工工段。　（顾雷）
