From the first session of the first National People's Congress to the third session, a full year has passed. This has been a year of great transformation. During this period, our country's socialist revolution has achieved fundamental victory, bringing about profound historical changes in our social life. Socialist construction has also achieved tremendous successes, enabling us to complete and even exceed the targets of the first Five-Year Plan for developing our national economy. Moreover, in the practice of socialist revolution and construction, we have gained many valuable experiences and lessons, ensuring the continued development of our socialist cause. This year, marked by these great and brilliant achievements, will be recorded in the annals of our country's history.

Regarding the government's work over the past year, the State Council has decided that I should report to the fourth session of the first National People's Congress. My report is based on the guidelines proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong in his report on "The Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the eleventh enlarged meeting of the State Council. This report is divided into five parts: (1) The Socialist Revolution; (2) Socialist Construction; (3) People's Livelihood; (4) Basic National Institutions; (5) Domestic and International Unity.

1. The Socialist Revolution

In 1956, our country basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in terms of private ownership of the means of production. The individual economies of 120 million peasant households and over 500,000 handicraft workers have been transformed into collective economies. The 70,000 private industrial enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Nearly 2 million private shops, large and small, have been transformed into joint state-private shops, cooperatives, cooperative groups, or directly into state-owned shops. This is a socialist revolution that has transformed the private ownership of the means of production, which has existed for thousands of years, into public ownership. Due to the maturity of various conditions, the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, and the efforts of the entire nation, in this great revolution, social property was not damaged, social order was not disrupted, and social production did not decline. On the contrary, in the first year of achieving fundamental victory in this revolution, we achieved great successes in all aspects.

The natural disasters of 1956 were not only the largest in our country since liberation but also the largest in several decades. Approximately 2.3 billion mu of farmland were affected, and about 70 million people were affected. In the first year of implementing agricultural cooperativization nationwide, our agriculture experienced such a severe test of natural disasters. Under the active leadership and support of the Party and the government, peasants across the country demonstrated the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and achieved the goal of increased production. In 1956, the total agricultural output value of the country was approximately 583 billion yuan, an increase of 27.4 billion yuan over 1955, nearly reaching the target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan; the grain production (excluding soybeans) was 365 billion jin, an increase of 154 billion jin over 1955, exceeding the target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan. During the peak of cooperativization, due to the focus on organizing cooperatives, fertilizing, and basic construction such as water conservancy projects, and concentrating mainly on increasing grain production, some rural sideline industries in certain places were temporarily affected. In 1956, cotton and rapeseed were the most severely affected, with production decreasing compared to 1955. However, in the first year of implementing cooperativization, except for the regions severely affected by disasters, more than 75% of the peasant households increased their income to varying degrees, while only about 10% of the households saw a decrease in income. For the disaster-stricken areas, the government spent 860 million yuan last year on flood control, rescue, dike repair, and relief, and issued production and disaster relief loans totaling 860 million yuan. From last July to the present, the grain sent to the disaster-stricken areas has increased by 70 billion jin, and the collective disaster relief and production mutual aid of agricultural cooperatives have played a significant role.

In 1956, due to the simultaneous growth of urban and rural basic construction and production, the demand for means of production suddenly increased, leading to a tense supply situation for various materials, especially building materials and metal materials. However, despite this, the production and business operations of handicrafts and joint state-private enterprises also developed. In this year, the total output value of handicrafts reached 117 billion yuan, an increase of 16% over 1955; the total industrial output value of joint state-private enterprises reached 191 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 32% over the total output value of these enterprises in 1955. In 1956, the total retail sales of joint state-private shops, cooperatives, and cooperative groups reached 110 billion yuan, an increase of more than 15% over the total retail sales of these enterprises in 1955. Within less than a year since the implementation of joint state-private operations in the entire industry, the government has completed the work of determining shares and dividends for the private sector and has made general arrangements for private sector personnel.

It is known that once small-scale production is transformed into a socialist collective economy, capitalism loses its basis for existence and development. It can be imagined that during the peak of agricultural and handicraft cooperativization and the great development of the socialist economy, if the government had not adopted the policy of treating private industry and commerce equally, making reasonable arrangements, and carrying out transformations, or if private industrial and commercial operators had not participated in joint state-private operations and refused to be transformed, then the production and business operations of over 2 million private industrial and commercial enterprises would not only not have developed but would necessarily have been weakened and even eliminated, and the employees of private enterprises and some business operators would have faced unemployment and career changes. This would not only be detrimental to the country and the people but also more detrimental to industrial and commercial operators. Since the founding of the nation, the Party and the government have placed private industry and commerce within the overall planning of the state, implementing the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming them. In 1956, private industrial and commercial operators, under the irresistible trend of the times, accepted the method of joint state-private operations for the entire industry, thus basically completing the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production in the entire country.

The socialist transformations of our country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce were not accidental but were prepared by the historical development of our country. In 1949, after the victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution nationwide, our revolution entered the socialist revolution period. Subsequently, we carried out five major campaigns: land reform, resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis," and ideological remolding. Land reform thoroughly destroyed the feudal foundation. The resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea repelled the challenge of U.S. imperialism to New China, dispelling the pro-American, pro-American, and fear-of-American thoughts of some people, especially many intellectuals. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries struck a significant blow to various counter-revolutionary elements, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. The "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis" repelled the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, creating favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. The ideological remolding campaign criticized many reactionary ideas, initially solving the problem of for whom to serve for the majority of intellectuals.

It is clear that without the victory of these movements, it would not have been possible to achieve the basic victory of the socialist revolution in such a short time after the founding of New China. These movements were all carried out under the leadership of the Party in the form of mass struggles because without adopting this form, it would not have been possible to mobilize the broad masses of the people to achieve the victory of the movements, nor would it have been possible for the masses to be tempered and raise their consciousness in the movements, paving the way for the three great transformations. Therefore, regardless of the achievements of these movements or the forms in which they were carried out, they should not be doubted. The victory of the five major movements ensured that the three great transformations could be carried out smoothly. The three great transformations themselves were also carried out in a prepared and step-by-step manner. The socialist transformation of agriculture went through the development process from mutual aid teams to low-level cooperatives and then to high-level cooperatives. The socialist transformation of handicrafts went through the development process from low-level forms such as supply and marketing cooperatives and decentralized production joint operations to high-level forms such as handicraft cooperatives, from small-scale handicraft cooperatives to relatively large-scale handicraft cooperatives. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce went through the development process from processing and commissioning, unified purchasing and marketing to partial joint state-private operations and then to joint state-private operations for the entire industry. At the same time, the three great transformations were carried out in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner. Understanding the historical development process and mutual relationship of the aforementioned five major movements and three great transformations, one can understand the fundamental reason why industrial and agricultural production could not only proceed normally but also achieve great development in the first year after the great historical transformation involving the lives of 600 million people.

In the aforementioned great mass movements, there were indeed some deviations and errors in specific work. The government has already checked and handled some of these deviations and errors, and some are still being checked. We welcome the continued criticism and suggestions from the people nationwide. Of course, when checking deviations and errors, we need to analyze both subjective and objective factors, to analyze which deviations and errors could have been avoided at that time and which could not have been completely avoided or even were unavoidable. In this way, we can determine the nature, degree, and scope of these deviations and errors. For those deviations and errors that could indeed have been avoided under the conditions at that time, we must learn from them and correct them resolutely; for those who suffered unjust harm in the movements, we should publicly apologize to them; for issues that were not resolved in the movements, relevant departments should handle them promptly now.

However, the deviations and errors that occurred in the previous movements cannot cover up the objective needs that gave rise to these movements at that time and the basic achievements of these movements. Take the ideological remolding campaign, for example. Since this campaign was also carried out in the form of a mass movement, the handling of some issues was relatively rough, thereby hurting the self-respect of some intellectuals from the old society and the bourgeoisie. However, through the ideological remolding campaign, the vast majority of intellectuals were indeed helped to basically cross the threshold of the socialist revolution. This is proven by the fact that the vast majority of intellectuals expressed their support for socialism in this rectification campaign. Again, take the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, for example. Among the counter-revolutionaries handled by the government over the years, there are the following four categories:

(1) Those sentenced to death for accumulating great evil and inciting great public outrage, accounting for 16.8%, of whom the vast majority were sentenced from liberation to 1952. This was absolutely necessary at that time; (2) Those undergoing labor reform, accounting for 42.3%, of whom 25.6% have been released after serving their sentences or have been placed in production, and 16.7% are currently in custody undergoing labor reform; (3) Those under control, accounting for 32%, of whom 22.9% have had their control lifted, and 9.1% are still under control; (4) Those who were arrested and then released after lenient treatment and education, accounting for 8.9%. From this, it can be seen that among these counter-revolutionaries, 57.4% have been released and had their control lifted after undergoing labor reform or lenient treatment, and they have obtained the opportunity to become new people. Those who are still undergoing labor reform or control, as long as they confess and abide by the law, honestly accept reform, will also obtain the opportunity to become new people. According to the government's preliminary inspection, the handling of these counter-revolutionaries has only a few deviations, and the vast majority are completely correct. Some people claim that the deviations in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries reached more than 90%. This is completely groundless. Chairman Mao Zedong has already proposed to conduct another inspection of this movement, and we believe that the inspection results will continue to prove this point.

The previous five major movements were either the completion of the democratic revolution or part of the socialist revolution. Therefore, it is absolutely not possible to use individual or even partial errors in revolutionary movements to shake the achievements of revolutionary movements. Even if there are relatively serious errors in individual units or even individual regions, it is still not possible to deny the achievements of these movements. Every time the Party and the government advocate a movement, it is based on the urgent objective needs, after careful study and typical experiments, and every movement mobilizes the broad masses to participate and gain their support. In this way, it is ensured that the achievements of the movements are basic, and the deviations and errors are individual. Some people say that if we say the achievements of these movements are basic and the deviations and errors are individual, this is "dogmatism," this is "formula" and "new eight-legged essays." In fact, these people raise the slogans of opposing "dogmatism," opposing "formula" and "new eight-legged essays," etc., precisely to exaggerate errors, cover up achievements, and lead some people with unstable positions or unclear right and wrong to regard these individual or partial deviations and errors as the fundamental or overall nature of these movements, in order to achieve their goal of shaking the achievements of revolutionary movements and opposing the socialist revolution.

We say that the socialist revolution has basically achieved victory, and large-scale, stormy class struggles have basically ended. However, this does not mean that class struggles have ended. We now emphasize the need to correctly handle contradictions among the people, but this does not mean that there are no contradictions between us and the enemy. It should be pointed out that there are still classes in existence in our country today. Although the landlord class and the bureaucrat capitalist class have already been eliminated, the members of these classes are still being reformed in their work and life, and their inherent class thoughts and class feelings cannot be completely changed. Although the vast majority of private industrial and commercial operators have joined joint state-private operations, they still receive dividends and have an exploitative relationship with the working class, so the two-faced nature of the bourgeoisie still exists. For example, some people advocate or support extending the dividend period to 20 years, some want to pay the 20-year dividend at once, some say dividends are not exploitation but merely "unearned income," saying that there is no fundamental difference between bourgeois class members and working-class members, and even saying that "bureaucratism is more dangerous than capitalism." These fallacies are all due to the exploitative thoughts of the bourgeoisie's greedy and insatiable nature, all are cover-ups for the attempt to restore capitalism. Some capitalists advocate the withdrawal of state representatives from joint state-private enterprises, which is a blatant expression of resistance to socialist transformation. Isn't this a clear indication that the bourgeoisie still exists with its two-faced nature? Isn't this a clear indication that bourgeois class members still need to be further reformed? The socialist transformation of bourgeois class members is to make them conduct self-criticism, gradually change their bourgeois stance and thoughts and feelings, that is, to undergo a fundamental transformation of their essence. To achieve this, long-term reform work is indispensable. For the vast majority of industrial and commercial operators who are willing to accept socialist transformation, what is wrong with this? Now, isn't it the case that more and more industrial and commercial operators are recognizing this? From the aforementioned situation, it can be seen that in the contradictions among the people today, there is still a side of opposition between the bourgeoisie and the working class, there is still a serious class struggle, not to mention that outside the people, there are still contradictions between us and domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists. As everyone can clearly see, in this rectification campaign, there is ideological struggle as well as political struggle. Therefore, when we correctly handle contradictions among the people, we must not overlook the existence of class struggles, nor can we overlook the existence of contradictions between us and the enemy. Consolidating the achievements of the socialist revolution and continuing and thoroughly completing the socialist transformation is still an important task for us in the future.

2. Socialist Construction

Our country's socialist construction is being carried out simultaneously with the socialist revolution. In our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, we have correctly planned the steps of combining construction and transformation. In 1956, with the arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation, our country's socialist construction made a leap forward in development. The scale and speed of development of economic and cultural undertakings have far exceeded the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, and some have even exceeded the total growth of the first three years.

Now, let me cite some figures to illustrate this situation.

Our country's total industrial output value (excluding handicraft output value, the same below) increased by 177 billion yuan in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, while in 1956 alone, it increased by 139 billion yuan. It is precisely because of this rapid development that the total industrial output value in 1956 reached 586 billion yuan, exceeding the target set by the Five-Year Plan for 1957. Looking at the main industrial products, the increase in steel production in the first three years was 150 million tons, while in 1956, it increased by 161 million tons. The production of metal-cutting machine tools, due to the adjustment of equipment and changes in models, although the number of units did not increase significantly compared to 1952, there was great development in the increase of new varieties and improvement of quality. By 1956, on this new basis, it increased by more than 12,200 units compared to 1955. In addition, heavy industrial products such as electricity, coal, oil, chemical fertilizers, and cement, the production in 1956 was significantly higher than the annual production in the first three years. Important new products such as jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, large-scale power generation equipment, and single-axis automatic lathes were also successfully manufactured in this year. The production of light industry benefited from the favorable conditions of the bumper harvest in 1955 and grew rapidly. For example, the production of cotton yarn increased by 350,000 pieces in the first three years, while in 1956, it increased by 127,000 pieces; the production of cotton cloth increased by 20.5 million pieces in the first three years, while in 1956, it increased by 43 million pieces; the production of sugar increased by 160,000 tons in the first three years, while in 1956, it increased by nearly 110,000 tons.

In 1956, our country's agriculture, despite the severe natural disasters, as mentioned earlier, still increased its total output value by 27.4 billion yuan, exceeding the average annual increase of 23.8 billion yuan in the first three years. In 1956, under the joint efforts of the state and agricultural cooperatives, agricultural construction made great progress. The first three years saw the reclamation of 360 million mu of wasteland, while in 1956, 290 million mu of wasteland were reclaimed; the first three years saw the expansion of irrigation area by 41 million mu, while in 1956, the irrigation area was expanded by more than 100 million mu.

In 1956, the country completed nearly 140 billion yuan in basic construction investment, equivalent to one-third of the total investment stipulated by the Five-Year Plan, thus changing the situation where basic construction investment in the first three years only completed slightly more than half of the Five-Year Plan, making the proportion completed in the first four years reach 86%, thereby ensuring that the basic construction plan for the first five years can be completed and exceeded. The new steel production capacity added in 1956 alone was 142 million tons; the newly built and repaired railways totaled 3,108 kilometers.

In line with the rapid development of production and construction, the transportation and trade sectors also saw significant development in 1956. The cargo volume of modern transportation nationwide increased by 1.12 billion tons in the first three years, while in 1956, it increased by 930 million tons; the total retail sales of commercial institutions increased by 113 billion yuan in the first three years, while in 1956, it increased by 62 billion yuan.

The cultural and educational undertakings also saw significant development in 1956.

Obviously, the construction achievements of 1956 are extremely great. This enables the state to have sufficient strength to support the newly established cooperative economy and joint state-private economy, thereby strengthening the socialist economic front and consolidating the victory of the socialist revolution; at the same time, it ensures that the various indicators of our country's first Five-Year Plan can be completed and exceeded relatively smoothly, thereby preparing favorable conditions for the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan.

The government's arrangement of national construction work in 1956 was generally correct, but there were also many shortcomings and errors. These shortcomings and errors will be pointed out in detail in the reports on the state budget and the national economic plan to be delivered by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo on behalf of the State Council. Some items in the 1956 budget expenditure and some indicators in the national economic plan were a bit high. From the financial aspect, the result of executing the state budget was that the expenditure exceeded the income by 1.83 billion yuan, using 1.65 billion yuan from the surplus of previous years, and also overdrafting 180 million yuan from the bank, and the bank issued more currency, thus using about 20 billion yuan from the reserve materials. From the economic and cultural aspects, the basic construction investment was 15 to 20 billion yuan more, at the same time, the number of employees increased more, the number of new students enrolled in higher and secondary schools also increased more, and the wages of some employees also increased more. Therefore, although the output value of the production materials industry in our country increased by 41% in 1956, and the output value of the consumer goods industry increased by 22%, the supply of these two types of materials was still tight, and the state's reserve of materials was reduced. Among the reasons for the tight supply of materials, the main reason was that the basic construction investment was a bit high, and the "stalls" were set up too many, thus increasing the financial expenditure, increasing the number of employees and the total wage bill, and also increasing the consumption of production materials and consumer goods.

Regarding the basic construction work in 1956, we should conduct a specific analysis. Due to the completion of civil engineering in many construction projects in the first three years, large-scale equipment installation work was needed in 1956, and many projects had completed design and construction preparation work, needing to start large-scale construction in 1956. Also, due to the strengthening of design and construction forces and the increase in self-sufficiency of equipment, new projects needed to be arranged in 1956. In this way, the basic construction projects increased greatly. Now, looking at the construction projects, the majority are arranged appropriately, a small part started too early, or the progress was too fast, and there are also individual projects that are arranged inappropriately. Inappropriate projects are obviously wrong. Those projects that started too early and had too fast progress indeed caused some losses in that year, but for the long-term construction cause, they are still needed. At the same time, there are some projects, mainly some non-production projects, due to the high construction standards, causing a lot of waste. These should be taken as lessons, and in the future, we should strive to avoid them.

Due to the tight supply of materials caused by the excessive basic construction investment, we began to notice this situation in the second and third quarters of 1956 and took some measures to stop the further development of the tight supply situation. Later, when drafting the 1957 national economic plan and state budget drafts, we drew this lesson, reduced a part of the basic construction investment, and appropriately increased the state's reserve.

The 1957 national budget draft and the national economic development plan draft submitted to this conference for deliberation show that our socialist construction cause is developing forward with both active and reliable steps. The national budget revenue in 1957 will increase by nearly 2% compared to 1956; to avoid the phenomenon of budget deficit like last year, the national budget expenditure will decrease by 4% compared to 1956. The total industrial output value in 1957 will increase by 4.5% compared to 1956, reaching 603 billion yuan. The total agricultural output value will increase by 4.9% compared to 1956, reaching 611 billion yuan. The basic construction investment will be reduced to 111 billion yuan, although it is 20% less than 1956, it is still 14 billion yuan more than the original plan for 1957, and the total for five years will still exceed the original plan by about 50 billion yuan. In the past five months and more of 1957, the execution of the budget and plan has been generally good. If the people of the whole country can practice frugality and increase production, implement the policy of building the country through hard work and frugality, strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, and not encounter major natural disasters, then we can smoothly complete the various indicators for 1957, and also ensure the completion and exceeding of our country's first Five-Year Plan, thereby laying the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. Regarding our country's second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has proposed a suggestion, and the State Council has accepted this suggestion and is currently in the process of specific formulation by relevant departments.

It should be pointed out that the great achievements we have already achieved and will achieve in the construction of the first Five-Year Plan are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet government. During the period of the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union helped design and supply equipment for a total of 156 construction projects, provided our country with a large amount of long-term preferential loans, and sent a large number of technical experts to help us carry out various construction work. This sincere assistance is worthy of our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people again. Now, there are still people who attempt to erase the great significance of the Soviet Union's sincere assistance to our country, which is obviously an attempt to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, undermine international unity, and thus undermine our country's socialist construction cause.

Regarding the achievements of our country's socialist construction, some people have different views and estimates in recent periods.

Some people believe that our country's national economic development plan fully advanced in 1956 and fully retreated in 1957. Obviously, this view is incorrect. Our country's 1956 plan was formulated in the context of the high tide of transformation and construction. The basic victory of the socialist revolution greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the laboring people to build socialism, and they demanded to increase production and raise work quotas. The bumper harvest in 1955 agriculture prepared the material conditions for the development of the national economy. At the same time, basic construction developed to the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, and it indeed had the necessity to expand the scale. These situations all indicate that we not only need to but also have the possibility to accelerate the pace of construction. The 1956 plan was formulated in response to this situation, taking a leap forward step, and achieved the great successes mentioned earlier in various aspects. It is true that some indicators were a bit high. However, this is a shortcoming of a partial nature. Even if we say that the basic construction investment was 15 to 20 billion yuan more, it only accounts for 5% to 6% of the total expenditure last year, and it is still a shortcoming of a partial nature. Therefore, it is not possible to say that the construction in 1956 was a full-scale advance. In 1957, due to the poor harvest situation last year and the reduction of the state's financial and material reserves, under these circumstances, appropriately slowing down the pace of construction, accumulating strength, and preparing for better progress in the future is completely necessary. This is not a full-scale retreat. We should understand that nothing will develop in a straight line. With the change of objective conditions, the development speed will inevitably have fast and slow periods and will often be unbalanced. The development of the socialist construction cause is also like this. Especially for a country like ours with a large population and poverty, due to the large proportion of agriculture, natural disasters often occur, requiring the national economy to develop at the same speed year after year without any fluctuations, this is an unrealistic idea.

Some people believe that our country's first Five-Year Plan has been ruined, which is completely wrong. Whether from the aspects of industrial production, agricultural production, basic construction, culture and education, or financial revenue and expenditure, our country's first Five-Year Plan is a success, it is well done rather than ruined. Comparing the 1957 plan figures with the 1952 actual figures, our country's total industrial output value has increased by 1.2 times, that is, an increase of 333 billion yuan. In terms of steel production, the total for the first five years will reach 163 million tons, while the total steel production of the old China, including the Northeast during the Japanese invasion, from 1900 to 1948, 49 years in total, was only 76 million tons. Of course, comparing our current steel production with that of industrially developed countries is still very low. Therefore, the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry while fully paying attention to the development of agriculture and light industry should continue to be adhered to in the future. If our country's 1957 agricultural plan is completed, the total agricultural output value will increase by 26% compared to 1952, that is, an increase of 127.6 billion yuan. In terms of grain and cotton, the actual production from 1952 to 1956 over five years was 165.8 billion jin of grain and 130 million piculs of cotton, while the old China from 1932 to 1936 over five years was the best agricultural harvest years before liberation, with a total grain production of only 130 billion jin and a total cotton production of only 60.5 million piculs. Do not forget that during the period from 1952 to 1956, there were two major disaster years. During the first Five-Year Plan period, we started the construction of more than 800 industrial enterprises above the designated scale, many water conservancy projects and railway projects, as well as the Yangtze River Bridge project, etc., all with relatively large scales and relatively new technologies. Among them, 156 construction projects assisted by the Soviet Union in design and equipment supply are all first-class in technology. These construction projects have played and will continue to play a great role in our country's socialist industrialization and agricultural production development, not only in the first five years but also in the future. These construction projects are mostly unimaginable in the old China era. During the first Five-Year Plan period, 8,500 kilometers of railways were newly built, while the Kuomintang government only built 2,600 kilometers of railways in 22 years of rule. Our country's cultural and educational undertakings also developed greatly during this period. For example, the number of graduates from institutions of higher learning totaled 280,000 over the first five years, thus cultivating a large number of construction talents for New China, while the old China from 1912 to 1947, 36 years in total, only had 210,000 plus people. In terms of financial situation, the total financial revenue and expenditure over the first five years were both 1,369.14 billion yuan, and the revenue and expenditure were balanced. Among them, the income from foreign loans was 3.1 billion yuan, accounting for only 2.3% of the national budget revenue. This fully shows that our country basically relied on internal accumulation to carry out large-scale construction. The five-year financial expenditure, approximately 60% was used for national construction undertakings; the proportion of expenditure on economic construction undertakings and social and cultural undertakings was increasing year by year, while the proportion of administrative and national defense expenditure was decreasing year by year. This fully proves that our country's first Five-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful economic construction and cultural construction. While carrying out large-scale construction, due to the development of production, the living standards of the people have also improved accordingly, and I will explain this in the next part of the report. The great achievements of our country's first Five-Year Plan are undeniable. Those who say that the first Five-Year Plan has been ruined, they hold an antagonistic attitude towards the socialist cause, deliberately erasing the fruits of the hard work of the people of the whole country. Such people, they are most unhappy with the socialist planned economy and yearn for the capitalist economy. However, their difficulty is that the vast majority of the people of the whole country do not stand on the side of capitalism but firmly stand on the side of socialism.

Some people believe that the unified purchase and marketing system is terrible, which is a direct attack on the socialist economic system. The socialist planned economy in China is for the sake of the lives of 600 million people, which is fundamentally different from the capitalist free competition that only cares about the enrichment and enjoyment of a few people and disregards the lives and deaths of the majority. Our country has a large population and the economy is still backward, so the supply of consumer goods cannot be very sufficient; our country's agriculture sometimes has a bumper harvest, sometimes has a poor harvest, and often here has a bumper harvest while there has a poor harvest. To cope with this unbalanced situation, it is necessary to take care of the poor harvest years and regions in the bumper harvest years and regions, and it is also necessary to prepare for especially serious natural disasters and other unexpected events; our country's industrial and transportation construction is being carried out on a large scale, and the urban population is also increasing continuously; these situations all indicate that in a country like ours, if we do not implement the unified purchase and marketing system for grain and other major consumer goods and carry out reasonable allocation, then the lives of the broad laboring people cannot be guaranteed, and the socialist construction cause cannot proceed smoothly. Therefore, the unified purchase and marketing system for grain and other major consumer goods is an important policy of our country's socialist economy in the aspect of distribution. The practice of the past four years has proven that this policy has ensured that both urban and rural people can obtain the most necessary and reasonably priced consumer goods, free from the exploitation of private merchants, even in the years and regions with disasters. This policy has supported industrial construction, ensured market stability, and thus helped the smooth development of our country's socialist cause. How can it be said that the unified purchase and marketing system is terrible? Those who hold this view either covet the free enjoyment of a few people or are infatuated with capitalist free competition, aiming to achieve personal enrichment. We criticize this wrong view, but we are not denying that there are some shortcomings in the unified purchase and marketing system. For example, the work of unified purchase and marketing of grain once had the problem of over-supply, and it was necessary to increase procurement, thus causing the phenomenon of over-procurement and under-retention of grain in some regions. Again, for the work of unified marketing of cotton cloth, last year's cotton cloth production increased significantly, and the supply was a bit loose, while this year's cotton cloth production decreased, and it was necessary to reduce the supply. These are all shortcomings caused by the government's lack of foresight and overall planning in work. The government will continue to pay attention to the inspection and correction of various shortcomings.

Some people oppose learning from the Soviet experience and even believe that the shortcomings and errors in our construction work are the result of learning from the Soviet Union. This is a very harmful view. We believe that learning from the Soviet Union is completely necessary, the problem lies in how we learn. If we learn poorly, the responsibility lies entirely with us. The Soviet Union is the first country in the world to build socialism and has rich advanced experience. We are engaged in socialist construction and do not learn from the Soviet Union, do we learn from the United States to build capitalist experience? In fact, it is precisely because we have seriously learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union that we have avoided many detours in our construction work and achieved great successes. Of course, we should not mechanically transplant the experience of other countries, even if it is their successful experience, we must make a selection and when using it, we must also combine it with the specific situation of our country. We are doing something that has never been done before, when we have not experienced it ourselves, it is not easy to choose the experience of others appropriately, and it is even more difficult to combine it with the specific situation of our country. Improving the ability to choose and learning to use correctly not only requires a certain amount of time but may also require paying a certain price. If we learn well, we can shorten the time and pay less. Therefore, we must continue to strive, criticize and overcome the dogmatic learning method. At the same time, we must also criticize the revisionist view that denies the universal truth of Marxism and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as dogmas. And at present, when right-wing elements are using revisionism to oppose socialism, our opposition to revisionism has even greater significance. It should be affirmed that in the future, we will continue to learn seriously from the Soviet Union and from all socialist countries. Of course, all knowledge and experience beneficial to the people from other countries, if possible, we will also learn from them.

Next, I would like to discuss some opinions on the issue of educational reform and the march towards science.

Regarding the issue of educational reform.

A certain culture is the reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society in the realm of ideology, and it serves these politics and economics. The education of old China mainly promoted slave education, feudal education, and bourgeois education, serving imperialism and the domestic ruling class. The education of New China is fundamentally different from that of old China and must reflect the new politics and new economics of socialism, must serve the broad laboring people, and must meet the needs of our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction. Therefore, we have the necessity to carry out fundamental reforms on the old education we have inherited. Over the past few years, we have carried out such reforms and have achieved great successes. This must be affirmed. In the future, with the victory of the socialist revolution and the development of socialist construction, we should continue to carry out some necessary reforms. In the past, the education department also had some deviations in implementing educational reform, mainly denying the reasonable parts of old education, not systematically summarizing and inheriting the experience of revolutionary education in the liberated areas, and not combining the learning of Soviet experience with the actual situation of our country enough. These shortcomings should be corrected in the future. However, if someone because of these shortcomings in educational reform denies that the achievements of educational reform are basic, or even fundamentally denies the necessity of educational reform, and attempts to make today's education return to the old path of education in old China, that is completely wrong.

In the educational reform, a relatively prominent issue is the adjustment of systems and teaching reforms in institutions of higher learning. The institutions of higher learning in old China, in order to meet the needs of imperialism and domestic reactionary rule, were abnormally concentrated in coastal cities, and most of the systems were redundant and repetitive, with vague and unclear training objectives. The content of most subjects was plagiarized from the set of capitalist countries. The situation of old education could not adapt to the needs of our country's socialist construction at all. At the same time, in the first few years after liberation, the international situation and the construction of new industrial bases in the interior also required some schools to implement internal migration. Under these circumstances, the education department and various institutions of higher learning have carried out enormous work in adjusting systems and teaching reforms over the past few years, fundamentally changing the face of higher education in our country, and generally being able to meet the needs of cultivating socialist construction talents. However, the education department had shortcomings in the process of adjustment and reform, such as inappropriate arrangements for some schools, not paying enough attention to the opinions and experience of old teachers, etc. We should sum up these experiences well, affirm the achievements, and overcome the shortcomings. In the future, we should strive to maintain the stability of institutions of higher learning, which is beneficial to the improvement of teaching quality. And we should better combine with the actual situation of our country, gradually improve the existing professional settings, teaching plans, and textbooks.

From the situation exposed in the recent rectification campaign, we should especially strengthen the ideological and political work in schools. First, teachers in schools are the soul engineers who cultivate the next generation, and they should, based on the foundation of past ideological remolding, continue to carry out self-education and self-reform on a voluntary basis. The ideological remolding of teachers has achieved successes, but this rectification campaign proves that it is not easy to make teachers master the ideological weapons of the proletariat, stand firmly in the face of class struggles, distinguish right from wrong, and guide students to move forward in the correct direction. Therefore, they should continue to strive, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, equip themselves with correct political views, strengthen their labor views, and gradually become one with the workers and peasants. Next, the education departments at all levels and school teachers should, based on the ideological situation of students, strengthen their ideological and political education, cultivate them into talents who are loyal to the socialist cause, diligent and simple, and combine physical labor with mental labor for national construction. The teaching materials and methods of political education have had the shortcoming of being detached from reality in the past, and in the future, we should sum up experiences and improve them. Over the past few years, political teachers in schools have done a lot of work, and in the future, they should continue to strive, improve their level, and exert greater strength.

Now, I would like to talk about the issue of students participating in labor after graduation. The development of our national economy requires the continuous improvement of the cultural level of workers and peasants, and requires a large number of cultured youth to join the ranks of laborers. Since liberation, our primary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of higher learning have all developed greatly. In order to meet the urgent need for high-level and mid-level construction talents of the state, institutions of higher learning and secondary specialized schools have enrolled more students. In this way, it has caused the phenomenon that almost all senior high school graduates have been promoted to higher education, most junior high school graduates have been promoted to higher education, and only a small part have participated in industrial and agricultural production in recent years. Especially last year, institutions of higher learning and secondary specialized schools all enrolled more students, and the promotion rate of junior high school and senior high school graduates has increased even more. However, it should be pointed out that this phenomenon is temporary and abnormal, and after the state's proper arrangement, it will gradually return to normal. This year, institutions of higher learning and secondary specialized schools will enroll fewer students according to the plan, and in the future, the education at all levels in our country will develop steadily on the basis of the development of the national economy. Therefore, in the future, on the one hand, there will be more and more graduates from primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools who will be promoted to higher education; on the other hand, there will be more and more graduates from primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools who will enter production labor. This will make the cultured physical laborers in our country increase day by day, and the ranks of intellectuals expand day by day. This is a normal and healthy phenomenon and will also be a long-term phenomenon in the future.

The education of old China was monopolized by the landlord and bourgeoisie, from primary school, especially from secondary school to university and studying abroad, the laboring people had very little share. The situation in New China is fundamentally different. Our education belongs to the laboring people. In recent years, the living standards of the laboring people in our country have gradually improved, and their demand to send their children to school for study has become more urgent. Therefore, although the educational undertakings at all levels in our country have developed in speed and scale beyond any era in our country's history in recent years, they still cannot satisfy the growing demands of the people. Our educational undertakings can only develop steadily on the basis of production development and cannot complete good things in one day.

Our future educational policy should be to cultivate laborers who have socialist consciousness, are cultured, and have good health. In the past, this policy was not clear enough. Most of our primary and secondary school graduates, except for a small part who were promoted to higher education, should participate in industrial and agricultural production. Institutions of higher learning should also strengthen labor education, and graduates should generally participate in a certain amount of physical labor after graduation. In the future, we should establish some systems and implement them gradually. In the past, the education administration department did not pay enough attention to labor education and did not take effective measures, and at the same time, there are remnants of the exploitative class's ideology of "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior" and "learning and then serving" in society, especially among some cadres, thus causing many young students to look down on physical labor, look down on workers and peasants, and not wanting to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor after graduation, which is an unhealthy phenomenon. We should clearly explain to all young students that our country is precisely because the laboring people are in charge that it has an unlimited bright future. In our country, labor is the most glorious thing, and workers and peasants are the most promising people. Young students should regard participating in industrial and agricultural production labor as the greatest glory, and at the same time, they should also realize that participating in industrial and agricultural production labor is difficult. The youth of New China should not be afraid of hardship, make up their minds to endure hardship, and work hard honestly. The parents of students nationwide and public opinion should encourage students to participate in production labor, especially agricultural production labor, and continue to criticize the erroneous thoughts and actions of some parents and cadres who look down on physical labor and obstruct students from participating in industrial and agricultural production labor. The education department should, based on the aforementioned educational policy, thoroughly and steadily improve the existing educational system, educational content, and teaching methods on the basis of educational reforms over the past few years.

I will briefly talk about the issue of sending students to study abroad. Over the past seven years, our country has sent more than 7,000 people to study abroad, and the standard for sending students is generally based on political, professional, and physical conditions, which is correct. In order to cultivate high-level intellectuals loyal to the socialist cause, before the basic victory of the socialist revolution, we placed special emphasis on the examination of political conditions for students sent abroad, which is completely necessary. The lesson that should be learned is that there was a formalistic shortcoming in the work of examining political conditions at that time, so a few students with poor political qualities were also sent out. At the same time, there was also a lack of attention to the professional and physical conditions of students. We decide that in the future, we will generally not send high school graduates, only send college graduates and graduate students to study the professions that are lacking domestically. The selection of students to study abroad should always pay attention to the examination of political conditions, and we should overcome the aforementioned various shortcomings. Some people believe that among the students sent abroad in the past, the children of revolutionary cadres accounted for too many. What is the fact? According to the available statistical materials, from 1952 to 1956, we sent out 6,435 students to study abroad, of whom the children of revolutionary cadres accounted for less than 3.5%. From this, it can be seen that such a statement is completely unfounded.

Regarding the march towards science.

In the past year, under the call of "marching towards science," our scientific undertakings have made important developments. The 1956-1967 scientific development long-term plan has been formulated and is already being implemented as a trial draft. In the field of natural sciences, the annual plan for 1957 has already been drafted. The State Council Science Planning Commission has become a permanent institution. Scientific research institutions in various fields have developed significantly, and the ranks of scientific workers have expanded. The principles of the scientific work system have been established. The cooperative system in scientific work has begun to be implemented. Regarding the issues of books, instruments, and other scientific work conditions, plans have been or are being formulated and gradually solved. Some important scientific experimental equipment is under construction. The heavy water type nuclear reactor with a capacity of 7,000 kilowatts and the cyclotron that can generate 25 million electron volts of alpha particles, both assisted by the Soviet Union, are under construction. Scientific research has also achieved many successes in the past year. All of these have inspired the enthusiasm of the broad scientific workers to march towards science, and at the same time, various departments and localities have shown great enthusiasm for scientific undertakings.

In the great tide of patriotic intellectuals marching towards science, however, some people say that China's scientific undertakings have fallen behind the Kuomintang era after liberation, and even say that in the next twelve years, it is not a matter of catching up with the international level but a matter of making up for the twelve years of lessons, as if since liberation, we have not only made no achievements in science but have also regressed. Can we agree with this statement? Look at the facts: First, the current scale of scientific undertakings, although still far from meeting the needs of our country's construction, is much larger in terms of researchers, institutions, funds, and equipment than in the Kuomintang era. Second, in terms of the level of scientific and technological development, it is not comparable to the Kuomintang era. First of all, many old scientific research institutions have developed in their research work, and many new disciplines have been established, especially in the fields of industry and national defense. High-level schools have also opened a large number of new majors. Third, the characteristic of New China's scientific undertakings is the close combination of science and production. Production is the fundamental driving force for science. In the Kuomintang era, due to the decline of agricultural and industrial production, scientists also did some research work, but they could not play a role in production. Since liberation, with the development of production, the production departments have put forward a large number of requirements to the scientific research departments, and our scientists have had ample opportunities to exert their talents in this regard and have already achieved great successes, but our scientific research strength is still far from meeting the needs of production. Fourth, the development of social sciences nationwide, under the correct guidance of Marxism, has also made new developments in the struggle to criticize bourgeois social sciences. Such development was completely unimaginable in the Kuomintang era. Social sciences have strong class characteristics, and after the victory of the revolution, our criticism of bourgeois social sciences is completely necessary. Fifth, the scientific team is rapidly expanding. Old scientists, after ideological remolding and work practice, have generally improved their political consciousness and professional abilities. Students returning from abroad have strengthened the strength of various disciplines. A large number of graduates from institutions of higher learning have prepared a solid reserve force for the development of our country's science. Based on the above, how can we say that New China's scientific undertakings are behind the Kuomintang era? How can we say that we need to make up for the twelve years of lessons? We say this, and we are not denying the efforts and achievements of Chinese scientists under the extremely difficult conditions of the Kuomintang era, and we have always regarded these hard-won achievements as part of China's scientific wealth. Those who say that New China's science is behind the Kuomintang era are simply denying the achievements of our scientists in the past eight years and denying the superiority of the socialist system.

Regarding the scientific plan, some people express doubts. They believe that scientific undertakings cannot be planned nationwide and long-term, and can only be carried out spontaneously and dispersedly by scientists. After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, in the tide of intellectuals marching towards science, in order to promote socialist construction, we invited hundreds of scientists to concentrate their wisdom and draft the initial blueprint for the development of our country's science, making our country's scientific undertakings have a general outline and direction, which is very necessary. The basic task of scientific and technological research is to develop production and fight against nature. If we do not organize our country's existing scientific forces appropriately, closely link them with the needs of socialist construction, and make a relatively comprehensive and long-term plan, then the development of our country's scientific undertakings will have no direction and will not be able to achieve the expected results. Of course, this plan should be supplemented and revised continuously according to various new situations in the future, and it may even have great changes. Even so, it cannot deny the necessity of this plan because without today's initial blueprint, there would not be a more perfect scientific work plan in the future. The socialist economy is a planned economy, and the scientific undertakings serving the socialist economy must also be planned. In addition to the state plan, it is undoubtedly necessary to allow scientists to engage in some research work in their own fields of expertise to fully exert the potential of scientists. However, opposing the planned nature of scientific research work, making scientific undertakings fall into a state of anarchy, is not beneficial to socialism and to scientific undertakings themselves.

In order to effectively develop our country's scientific research work, it is necessary to implement the principle of cooperation. All relevant departments must work in a coordinated manner. This year, the government has formulated relatively good coordination plans in medicine, agriculture, and machinery, and has already partially implemented them. This approach has saved the country a large amount of manpower and material resources and accelerated the development of scientific work, and it should be promoted in the future. Some people only support the development of scientific work in their own departments and do not support or even demand the restriction of scientific work in other departments. They often oppose coordinated work and even refuse the reasonable allocation of manpower and material resources by the state, which is a serious departmentalism that should be criticized. The national scientific research forces should be planned comprehensively, on the one hand, there is appropriate division of labor, and on the other hand, more importantly, there is close cooperation; on the one hand, we should advocate "a hundred schools of thought contend," and on the other hand, we should also oppose the obstruction of cooperation due to sectarianism. The system of our country's scientific research work should be composed of four aspects: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, institutions of higher learning, research institutions of various industrial departments under the central government, and local research institutions. In this system, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the national academic leadership and key research center, and institutions of higher learning, research institutions of various industrial departments under the central government (including factory and mine laboratories), and research institutions under local governments are the broad base of our country's scientific research. This is a principle of organizing our country's scientific team, and we require the responsible cadres of relevant departments to seriously advocate the spirit of cooperation, implement coordination plans, and quickly overcome the bad habit of departmentalism.

The development of scientific undertakings in New China is the result of the efforts of Chinese scientists under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government. Some people believe that the Communist Party of China and the people's government cannot lead scientific work, and that many current leaders are not scientists, "outsiders" cannot lead "insiders." Some people even believe that the existence of the State Council Science Planning Commission is an expression of distrust of Chinese scientists. The Communist Party of China and the people's government have always educated their cadres to continuously learn things they are not familiar with in their work, gradually improve their professional abilities, and do a good job. The leadership of scientific undertakings has two aspects: one is academic leadership, and the other is political and ideological leadership and administrative leadership. For academic issues, we have never advocated using administrative orders to interfere, and our leadership policy is "a hundred schools of thought contend," that is, to solve academic issues through the free debate and objective practice of the academic community. For the political and ideological, policy, planning, and other aspects of scientific work, more leadership from the Party and the government is needed. The facts of the past eight years have already proven this. The State Council Science Planning Commission is the institution responsible for the policies, plans, and major measures of managing scientific undertakings. It is responsible for the overall planning of the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, institutions of higher learning, scientific research institutions of various industrial departments under the central government, and local scientific research institutions. The twelve-year scientific plan is the collective labor result of hundreds of Chinese scientists, and most of the members of the Science Planning Commission are also scientists. How can this be said to be an expression of distrust of Chinese scientists? If the saying that "outsiders" cannot lead "insiders" means that only one's own field can lead one's own field, this not only denies the leadership of politics over science but also actually denies the possibility of any unified leadership in scientific research work because academic fields are divided, and there are no scientific leaders in the world who are proficient in all scientific fields at the same time. This theory can only play a disintegrating role in the scientific team and is not conducive to the development of scientific undertakings.

3. People's Livelihood

Since liberation, with the rapid recovery and development of our country's industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the broad masses of the people have also improved significantly. First, let us look at the living conditions of peasants, who make up more than 80% of our country's population. Since liberation, the total value of our country's agricultural production has been increasing year by year. In 1949, the total value of agricultural production nationwide was 326 billion yuan, and in 1956, it increased to 583 billion yuan, an increase of 79% over 1949. With the increase in the total agricultural output value, the purchasing power of peasants has also increased significantly. In 1950, the purchasing power of peasants nationwide was 81 billion yuan, and in 1956, it increased to 191 billion yuan, an increase of 136% over 1950. The consumption goods supplied by the state to peasants have also increased accordingly. In 1956, compared to 1950, the supply of cotton cloth increased by two times, rubber shoes increased by 1.9 times, salt increased by nearly one time, sugar increased by 2.3 times, kerosene increased by eleven times, and cigarettes increased by 1.4 times. In a country with over 500 million peasants, the growth of production and consumption is so great, which has never happened in old China. Now let us analyze the living conditions of workers, who make up the second largest population in the country. By the end of 1949, there were approximately 8 million employees in state organs, private and public enterprises, and institutions, and by the end of 1956, this number increased to 24 million, including approximately 3 million people who transferred from private enterprises to state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and village cadres. In seven years, we have solved the employment problem of approximately 13 million people, which has never happened in the history of old China. In 1952, the average annual wage of workers nationwide was 446 yuan per person, and in 1956, it increased to 610 yuan. In four years, it increased by nearly 37%. Such a wage increase rate has also never happened in the history of old China. Some people are blind to the significant changes in the living standards of the people of New China and say that the living standards of the people have declined since liberation. Workers and peasants are the majority of the people, and their living standards have improved, how can it be said that the living standards of the people have declined? It should be admitted that a small number of high-level intellectuals and a small number of workers, although their living standards have improved compared to a few years before liberation, have not yet returned to the level before the Anti-Japanese War. However, considering the situation that the living standards of the broad masses of workers and peasants are still relatively low, their living standards cannot be improved too much too fast. As for the extremely small number of exploiters from the old society, their living standards have declined compared to before liberation, which is completely reasonable. In a society ruled by the exploiting class, a few exploiters live in a life of extravagant luxury, while the broad laboring people who create social wealth live in a state of poverty and semi-starvation. Only in socialist New China can we think of the interests of all the people, first ensure the living needs of the vast majority of laboring people, and also take care of the reasonable needs of other strata. Those who say that the living standards of the people have declined since liberation, if they are not taking individual and partial phenomena as universal and general phenomena without analysis, then in their minds, they are only thinking of the extremely few exploiters and have not seen the broad laboring people.

Title: On the Question of Reforming Our Country's Institutions
Author: 刘少奇
Date: 1957-02-28
Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th.

We are an economically and culturally backward agrarian country with a large population and limited arable land. Our foundation is weak, and therefore, the living standards of our people are much lower compared to those in industrialized countries. Since liberation, the recovery and development of our industrial and agricultural production have been rapid. However, when calculated per capita, the average production has increased relatively slowly. The development of production and the growth of social wealth are the material foundations for improving people's lives. The speed at which people's lives improve is determined by the speed of production development, and in our current conditions, the growth rate of consumer goods production to a considerable extent determines the growth rate of agriculture. We are a country with 600 million people. If each person increases their purchasing power by one yuan per year, the purchasing power of the entire nation would increase by 6 billion yuan, and the state would need to correspondingly increase the supply of 6 billion yuan worth of consumer goods. If people use this money to buy food, it would require an additional 60 billion jin of grain. If people use this money to buy clothing, it would require an additional 20 million bolts of cloth, which is equivalent to an additional 2 million dan of cotton production. From 1952 to 1956, the production of consumer goods in our country increased by an average of over 30 billion yuan per year. After deducting a small amount of reserves and the consumption due to population growth, the amount available to improve people's lives is only about 4 yuan per person per year. These figures indicate that the improvement in people's lives each year has a certain limit. Exceeding this limit will lead to a shortage of consumer goods, an imbalance between purchasing power and material supply, and will affect the stability of market prices. Therefore, the living standards of 600 million people can only be gradually improved based on the development of domestic production and cannot be expected to improve too quickly. Some people, without considering the actual situation of our country as mentioned above, think that once we enter socialism, the living standards of the people will immediately improve significantly, and they do not understand that it is necessary to go through long-term hard work and arduous construction to gradually improve people's lives. In the past, we did not explain and propagate these principles sufficiently to the entire nation, which is a shortcoming. However, there are also people who constantly complain about the low living standards of the Chinese people, always talking about the American way of life. They are fantasizing about dragging China back to the old path of semi-colonialism, to live the life of a few exploiters again.

Some people say that the gap between the lives of workers and peasants is too wide. Is this statement in line with reality? We must admit that there is a difference in the lives of workers and peasants. However, when we compare the lives of workers and peasants, we must consider the different historical conditions of their lives and the different living conditions in cities and rural areas. In the old China, the vast majority of poor peasants lived a life of barely surviving, with barely enough clothes to wear and barely enough food to eat, and often had to rely on chaff and wild vegetables for half a year. After liberation, through land reform and the cooperative movement, the current situation of our peasants is generally that about 20% to 30% have a slightly surplus life; about 60% have a life of having enough to eat and wear; about 10% to 15% have a life of eating and wearing less, and these people still need the help of the state and agricultural cooperatives. On average, each peasant's net income from agricultural production per year is about 70 yuan, and the total income of each peasant household per year is about 300 yuan. The net income from agricultural production mentioned here includes not only the income that peasants receive from the production cooperative but also the income from individual agricultural production. Of course, the income of peasants across the country is not balanced, with less income in barren areas and more income in fertile areas. In 1956, the average annual wage of workers was 610 yuan, which is more than double the average annual income of a peasant household. If we only compare the monetary figures of income, it seems that the lives of workers and peasants are indeed very different. However, if we consider the different living conditions in cities and rural areas, the situation is different. In rural areas, maintaining a life of having enough to eat and wear, on average, requires only about 5 yuan per person per month. In cities, maintaining the same standard of living requires 10 yuan. Therefore, we believe that although there is a difference in the living standards of workers and peasants, it is not excessively wide, and it is also reasonable to maintain a certain difference in living standards between workers and peasants, given that the labor productivity of workers is much higher than that of peasants. In the past few wage reforms, we set the wage standards for some temporary workers, auxiliary workers, apprentices, and some temporary workers too high, which is a serious flaw and needs to be corrected. Peasants' dissatisfaction with the high wages of this part of the workers is also reasonable. However, this is different from those who deliberately exaggerate the gap between workers and peasants to incite discord between workers and peasants and sabotage the worker-peasant alliance. In the future, the wage standards for this part of the workers must be adjusted according to local conditions and combined with the living conditions of local peasants, so that their living standards are roughly balanced with the living standards of local peasants. We should also educate the working class to understand that industry cannot develop in isolation. The raw materials for industry and the market for industrial products, as well as the supply of living materials for workers, largely depend on the increase in agricultural production and the support of peasants. In the situation where the living standards of the vast majority of peasants cannot be improved quickly, workers should not put forward overly high demands for improving their lives.

Some people say that the gap between the treatment of high-level and low-level cadres is too wide. If this opinion is that in our country, which is still very poor, the living standards of workers and peasants are still very low, and therefore the treatment of high-level and low-level cadres should not be too different, then this opinion is correct. If this opinion is that different types of labor should not have a reasonable difference in treatment, then it is wrong. In a socialist system, the principle of distribution that corresponds to the level of social productive forces is to distribute according to labor. In a socialist society, the state should still pay a certain difference in remuneration for simple labor and complex labor, physical labor and mental labor. Abolishing this difference is not conducive to improving labor productivity and improving professional and technical levels. Therefore, we must oppose both excessive gaps and egalitarianism. During the wage reform last year and after the wage reform, in order to appropriately narrow the wage gap between high-level and low-level cadres, the state has taken measures to control or reduce the wage standards for enterprise leaders and high-level cadres in state organs. In the future, we will continue to take measures to gradually adjust and solve the unreasonable phenomena in the aspects of wages, housing, medical care, and supply system for high-level cadres. As for those who deliberately exaggerate the gap in treatment between high-level and low-level cadres, even slandering leaders as "exploiters," if they are not extremely ignorant, then they must have ulterior motives.

Next, I would like to talk about some opinions on the issues of employment, wage system, apprentice system, and people's cultural life.

Regarding the employment issue.

Since liberation, through years of effort, as mentioned earlier, the number of workers in the country has increased by 13 million, and the unemployed left over from the old society have basically been settled. Regarding the recruitment of high-level intellectuals, registration was conducted last year, and in the future, they will be arranged in batches according to their knowledge, expertise, and living conditions. After liberation, people's lives have stabilized, and social medical and health work has been strengthened, social relief and worker welfare have developed, and thus the birth rate has increased significantly. However, our industry is still backward, and the number of workers in state organs and industrial enterprises has already increased too much. In the future, only the necessary number of people will be absorbed each year according to the needs of production and work development. Therefore, for a long time to come, the main direction of employment will still be to engage in agricultural labor. Handicrafts and service industries will also be an auxiliary aspect of employment. Recently, the labor departments in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other places have actively helped nearly 10,000 unemployed people to engage in handicrafts, service industries, and various auxiliary labor for society, which is a good experience. In the future, we should also advocate that social organizations and the masses come up with various methods to expand the scope of employment and assist the state in solving the employment problem. In the field of social welfare, we should also mobilize the power of social organizations and the masses, advocate mutual aid among social organizations and the masses, and establish various social welfare undertakings. The various mutual aid methods introduced by the National Conference of Representatives of Workers' Families are effective and should be promoted and popularized. Regarding the wage system issue. The wage issue is a very complex issue of production and distribution. It reflects the relationship within the working class, between industries, between regions, between various types of personnel, and also reflects the relationship between workers and peasants, between accumulation and consumption, between collective interests and personal interests, between immediate interests and long-term interests. These aspects of the relationship need to be reasonably arranged, and when the old imbalances and old contradictions are solved, new imbalances and new contradictions will appear, which need to be constantly adjusted and solved.

At the beginning of liberation, the wage system in our country was very chaotic. The wage system left over from the old China was upside down, with huge gaps, and it was extremely unreasonable. It reflected the deformed development of the semi-colonial economy in old China and also reflected the mutual competition between various economic groups and ruling groups in old China. At the same time, many old cadres and workers still implemented the supply system in the old liberated areas. The chaotic state of the wage system is completely incompatible with the unified state organs and state-owned enterprises and public institutions. Through the wage system reforms in 1950, 1952, and 1956, we have initially established a wage system that is generally suitable for our country's situation. However, it is still very imperfect. In terms of wage grade system, piecework wage system, apprentice system, subsidy system, reward system, and regulations on labor insurance, public medical care, and welfare benefits for workers, there are still many places that are not in line with reality and are not reasonable, and we need to continue to improve them. In the process of wage reform, there are still many shortcomings. When we learned from the advanced wage work experience of socialist countries, we did not combine it well with our country's actual situation, and we lacked a serious study of the useful experience in the original wage system in China, and even took a simple negative attitude. This should be a lesson for us.

Regarding the apprentice system issue.

For the apprentice system before liberation, its feudal rules should be negated, but in terms of the apprentice's training period, training content, apprentice's treatment, and the system of paying the master, there are many good experiences that we should seriously study and absorb. The current short-term technical worker training classes and short-term apprentice training methods are worth our re-study and reform. Experience has shown that the technical workers trained in a short period of time generally have narrow technical knowledge and lack the ability to work independently in various aspects. At the same time, due to the high treatment during the apprentice period, too fast promotion after the end of the training period, and the unreasonable promotion examination system, it is easy to cause young workers to neglect practical experience in production, and even in some young workers, it is easy to foster a sense of pride and self-satisfaction. They regard mastering production technology knowledge as an easy thing, do not respect the technical experience accumulated by old workers through long-term practical experience, and do not humbly learn from old workers. This phenomenon has already affected the unity between new and old workers and the cooperation between masters and apprentices. We must patiently educate young workers to understand that comprehensive and proficient production technology cannot be learned in a few months or even a few years, and it must be gradually mastered through long-term practical experience and constant diligent practice. Old workers are a valuable asset of our country. Not only is their technical experience rich and valuable, but their political experience and life experience are also rich. They have long experienced the life of being oppressed and exploited in the old society, and they have also personally experienced the equal and happy life in the new society, so they best understand how to cherish and protect the fruits of the revolution. Young workers are the builders of socialist construction and the creators of the future beautiful life. However, they are still young, and their political experience and life experience are still limited, so learning from old workers and tempering themselves in practical experience is the main method for young workers to improve their class consciousness and technical knowledge in the future. Similarly, in the peasantry, young peasants should also be educated to respect old peasants and humbly learn from the production experience and political experience of old peasants. In the intellectuals, young intellectuals should be educated to respect old scientists, old educators, old engineers, old doctors, old writers, and old artists, and humbly learn from the knowledge and experience they have accumulated through years of hard work.

Regarding the issue of people's cultural life.

The cultural level of our country is backward, and illiteracy accounts for more than 70% of the population. Since liberation, we have actively promoted literacy and universal education. The number of primary school students in school has increased from 24 million in 1949 to 63 million in 1956. From 1949 to 1956, 22 million people have been eliminated from illiteracy. From 1951 to 1957, the state's expenditure on popular education is nearly 49 billion yuan, accounting for about 24% of the total educational expenditure and about 54% of the total expenditure on general education. Such development is quite rapid. However, it still cannot meet the requirement of children of school age to enter school on time. In addition to state-run schools, we should actively advocate collective-run schools and individually-run schools, and fully mobilize the power of social organizations and the masses to supplement the state's strength. In the past, there have been ups and downs in literacy work, and there have been errors in the treatment of some primary and kindergarten education. These are now being improved. The cultural life of the Chinese people has also improved significantly. In the future, we should, under the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," more fully mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of cultural and artistic workers and the broad masses of the people. The state can only concentrate on running a few demonstration cultural and artistic and sports undertakings and guide them to self-sufficiency. For a large number of various cultural and artistic undertakings, we should advocate that cultural and artistic workers run them by themselves. Experience has shown that the idea and method of the state taking everything over are not appropriate. More importantly, we should widely carry out amateur cultural and artistic and sports activities among the broad masses. The three aspects of state-run, self-run, and mass amateur cultural and artistic and sports activities should learn from each other and improve through practice, so as to gradually meet the people's needs for cultural life.

In improving the people's health and sanitation conditions and preventing diseases, we have also achieved some results in the past few years. Our medical and health teams have expanded rapidly, and the sanitation of urban and rural environments and personal hygiene have improved significantly. Several diseases that are most harmful to the people, such as plague, cholera, and smallpox, have been basically controlled. However, the health department still has the problem of being tight and loose in leading mass health movements; in the medical system, there are still many places that are unreasonable and inconvenient for the masses; and there are still phenomena of lack of unity and cooperation and mutual disrespect among medical and health personnel. In the future, we must resolutely overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, resolutely implement the mass line, thoroughly improve medical and health work, better give play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine, strengthen the unity of medical and health personnel, and ensure the further improvement of the people's health level.

The purpose of the socialist revolution and socialist construction is to develop production, improve people's lives, and make all laborers in a socialist society be able to share a prosperous and cultured happy life. This is the great ideal that the laboring people of our country have long yearned for. However, our country is still poor, our culture is still backward, our difficulties are still many, and our experience is still insufficient. To fundamentally get rid of poverty and backwardness, to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry and modern agriculture, and to make our people enjoy a happy and beautiful life, this is a long-term and arduous struggle. To achieve victory in this struggle, it is not a matter of a few years but requires decades of time. We must advocate thrift and simplicity from top to bottom and continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle. Our older generation must educate the younger generation to understand that a beautiful life must be created by their own hard work.

Regarding the basic system of the state.

Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. In our country, all power belongs to the people, and the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels are the organs through which the people exercise their power. In these organs and other state organs, the principle of democratic centralism is implemented. These are the basic systems of our country stipulated by the Constitution. Our state system is the superstructure of the socialist economic relations in our country. It is precisely because of this state system that the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country have been guaranteed, and in the future, we must also rely on this state system to guarantee the building of a socialist society in our country. Therefore, any shake to our country's basic system is unacceptable.

Of course, this does not mean that everything in our state system is already perfect and does not need any improvement and development. On the contrary, such improvement and development are constantly needed. The socialist social system in our country has only been initially established, and the remnants of the old production relations cannot but be reflected in some of our country's systems. Undoubtedly, these remnants of the old production relations will gradually disappear, and the socialist production relations will gradually become more solid and developed. Therefore, some organizational forms and methods of operation of our country's basic system must be constantly improved with the development of the economy and the changes in political situations. At the same time, our time of building socialism is still short, and our experience is still insufficient. Only by accumulating experience in the practice of building socialism can we gradually make our country's basic system itself more complete and perfect.

As for the various systems and organizational forms established based on our country's basic system in the fields of politics, economy, culture, etc., they must also be constantly improved with the changes in situations. For example, in the relationship between the central and local governments, in the early days of liberation, for the convenience of work, large area military and political committees or administrative committees were established. In 1954, in order to adapt to the need for strengthening unified management under the planned economy, we abolished the large area military and political committees. In the past two years, in order to correct the shortcomings of the central government concentrating too much power and managing too strictly in some aspects, we have studied the system issue, and now the government is preparing to appropriately expand the power of local governments, so that under the centralized leadership of the central government, the initiative and creativity of local governments can be fully brought into play to promote the cause of socialist construction. All these changes are necessary and correct. This example can illustrate that our various systems and organizational forms must be constantly improved with the changes in objective situations, otherwise, they cannot adapt to the economic base and serve the economic base, and may even hinder economic development.

At present, our various systems are indeed not perfect and have shortcomings. The reasons for this phenomenon are, on the one hand, that some systems were reasonable and correct when they were formulated, but when the situation changed, they were not changed in time; on the other hand, that some systems lacked in-depth investigation and research when they were formulated, and thus did not fully conform to the objective situation, and even were wrong. Some shortcomings in the system are due to the fact that when we learned from the advanced experience of socialist countries, we did not combine it well with the specific situation of our country. In the existing various systems, all the shortcomings and errors should be corrected, supplemented, or abolished by the relevant departments of the State Council by absorbing the beneficial opinions from all sides.

I would like to talk about the issue of legal system that many people are concerned about. The legal system of our country today is indeed not perfect, but it is not like what some people say, "completely without any law to follow." Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have formulated many important laws before and after the promulgation of the Constitution, such as the Trade Union Law, Labor Insurance Regulations, Land Reform Law, Model Constitution of Agricultural Cooperatives, Implementation Outline of National Regional Autonomy, Election Law, Marriage Law, Military Service Law, Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption, Regulations on Arrest and Detention, etc. At the same time, the government has formulated many single regulations and rules according to the needs of work, issued many decisions and instructions, and these have actually played the role of laws. In the early days of the founding of the state, especially in the transitional period, the political and economic situations changed rapidly, and it was difficult to formulate fundamental and long-term applicable laws in various aspects. For example, civil law and criminal law, before the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production and the establishment of socialist ownership, it was difficult to formulate. In such a situation, the state promulgated temporary regulations, decisions, and instructions as common work norms to be followed, which was necessary and appropriate. Only on the basis of the effectiveness of these regulations, decisions, and instructions can we summarize experience and formulate long-term applicable laws. Even the laws of capitalist countries were not perfect in the early days and were gradually formulated over a long period. Now that the socialist transformation of the means of private ownership has been basically completed and socialist ownership has been established, and the state has accumulated some experience in various aspects of work, we have the possibility to formulate socialist laws on the basis of summarizing past experience, while sorting out the existing laws and regulations, such as the criminal law has an initial draft, and the civil law and the Regulations on the Administration of Public Security Punishment are being drafted by the relevant departments.

Now, some rightists, under the pretext of helping the Communist Party with rectification, have issued many destructive statements, many of which are direct attacks on our country's basic system. They attack our state system from the perspective of bourgeois democracy; they slander the people's democratic dictatorship as the root cause of all errors and shortcomings; they try to use the method of denying achievements and exaggerating shortcomings to slander our state system. They try to establish another state power organ outside our highest state power organ, the National People's Congress, such as the so-called "Political Design Institute" and "Appeal Commission," and their purpose is nothing more than to make our state power deviate from the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party. They add various disguises to these destructive statements to try to deceive those who have not yet seen through their true face. Such anti-socialist statements, of course, cannot be compared with well-intentioned criticism. Criticizing shortcomings and errors is to make our socialist system healthier and more developed, which is what we welcome. However, the rightists, in essence, want to drag our country from the socialist path to the capitalist path. This is unacceptable to the broad masses of the people.

Our country has the functions of both democracy and dictatorship. Some people think that after the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, the task of dictatorship has already disappeared. This view is wrong. This is because there are still some residual counterrevolutionaries in our country who are still waiting for an opportunity. Among the former exploiting classes, there are still people who engage in activities to sabotage socialist construction. In addition, in society, there are still some thieves, swindlers, murderers, arsonists, gangsters, and various serious criminals who disrupt social order. Especially, we should not forget that American imperialism and the Kuomintang group are constantly carrying out armed provocations against us and are constantly sending spies and saboteurs to carry out sabotage and subversive activities. Therefore, we must not weaken the dictatorial function of our country. We must improve the work of the dictatorial organs, continue to strengthen national defense, defend our motherland, and defend our socialist cause.

According to the Constitution of our country, our citizens enjoy extensive democratic freedoms. With the development of the socialist cause in our country, this freedom is expanding and being more fully guaranteed. In capitalist countries, only a few members of the exploiting classes can enjoy freedom, while the broad laboring masses have no real freedom. In contrast, our socialist country guarantees the broad masses to exercise the freedoms given by the Constitution, while for those few counterrevolutionaries, their freedoms must be deprived. Rightists say that in our country, there is too little freedom, as if the state should provide convenience and guarantee for all speeches and actions that oppose the basic system of the Constitution and oppose socialism. Obviously, the people will not agree to provide such freedom.

Rightists also attack our electoral system. They think that only the elections in capitalist countries are the most democratic. In fact, some capitalist countries, although they implement so-called universal and direct elections, the ruling bourgeoisie always uses various methods, especially money and administrative means, to control elections and ensure their ruling position. In our country, on the contrary, the electoral system is first of all to guarantee the democratic rights of workers, peasants, and other laboring people, and at the same time, it also considers the few members of the bourgeoisie and other patriotic personages in the national population, so that they also have a certain proportion of representatives in the state power organs. At present, our country implements direct elections at the grassroots level and indirect elections at the county level and above. This electoral system is a relatively good democratic form that suits our current situation. However, this does not exclude the possibility of gradually implementing direct elections at the county level and above when conditions are ripe. In the process of elections, the joint candidate list proposed by the Communist Party and various democratic parties and people's organizations through consultation is appropriate. As for the issue of the number of candidates, in the past, in the joint candidate list, the number of candidates and the number of seats to be elected were equal, which was the result of consultation among all parties. In the future, the specific practice on this issue will also be decided through consultation among all parties. In short, our country's electoral system is to truly guarantee the democratic rights of the broadest masses of the people and to unite all forces that can be united on the basis of socialism, rather than using false forms to deceive the people and protect the interests of a few people.

Elections are one aspect of the people enjoying democratic rights. Our country's democratic life has more abundant content. The Constitution stipulates: "All state organs must rely on the masses, maintain close contact with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses." Our state organs work in accordance with this mass line method. Many important laws, in the process of formulation, have undergone full discussion and deliberation by the masses; the state's economic plans are also proposed by the relevant state departments to the grassroots production units for discussion by the broad masses and then determined; in order to mobilize the broad workers to actively participate in enterprise management and supervise the administrative leadership of enterprises, we are promoting the system of workers' congresses in enterprises; in agricultural production cooperatives, we have established the congress of members and the management committee according to the principle of democratic management. Our citizens often express their opinions on the work of various aspects of the government through people's representatives, supervisory organs, people's organizations, newspapers and periodicals, and often directly use letters and visits to state their opinions to the relevant leadership organs. Our state organs are precisely through these methods to listen to the opinions of the masses to improve their own work. The work of government leadership organs in dealing with people's criticisms, suggestions, visits, and letters is still not good, and we should correct it quickly and require all levels of government organs to attach great importance to this work. The rectification movement that is currently being carried out is also a prominent manifestation of our country's democratic life. To mobilize the masses to publicly expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors of our state organs and working cadres so as to overcome them is something that any country that claims to be free and democratic will not do and dare not do.

However, it should be pointed out that in our country's administrative management organs at all levels, there still exists, and even seriously exists, the habit of bureaucratism. The socialist system in our country has only been initially established, and the influence of the old society, especially bourgeois ideology, is constantly eroding the working cadres of our state organs; the cultural level of the people is still low, so they exercise the right to participate in the management and supervision of state affairs, and they are still subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, bureaucratism can easily grow in our state organs. At the same time, some shortcomings in our country's management system, such as large organizations, too many levels, and some powers being too concentrated, also foster bureaucratism. The existence of bureaucratic habits hinders the contact between our state organs and the people and has brought great losses to the work. We must continue to expand democracy, rely on the supervision of the masses, and constantly carry out the struggle against bureaucratism.

Our state organs implement democratic centralism, which is to combine extensive democracy with high centralization. We are not democratic for the sake of democracy. The reason why we want extensive democracy is to unite all forces to jointly build socialism and develop productive forces. If there is only democracy and no centralization, it will be impossible for the people of the whole country to carry out organized and unified struggle in a common direction and a unified plan, and it will be impossible to achieve the great goal of building a socialist society. The specific implementation of democratic centralism should be different according to the changes in objective situations. Everyone knows that in the period of revolutionary war and in the period of socialist revolution, we paid more attention to centralization in the two aspects of democracy and centralization, but even in the period of war and revolution, centralization was still based on extensive democracy, because without this, it would not be able to meet the needs of war, and it would not be able to guarantee the victory of the socialist revolution. After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, we have the possibility to further expand democracy. In the past two years, the expansion of democracy in the relationship between the central and local governments and in economic management work is very obvious. However, in any situation, we must not fundamentally negate the leadership of centralization because of the expansion of democracy. The petty bourgeoisie, from their spontaneous anarchist tendencies, often yearn for so-called "absolute democracy," that is, democracy without centralized leadership. This "absolute democracy" will only make the people fall into a state of disorganization and lack of organization, and it will not be able to use collective strength to guarantee the interests of the people. Therefore, the rightists who oppose socialism particularly like this idea of "absolute democracy," trying to use this idea to disperse the will of the laboring people and disintegrate the organizational nature and fighting spirit of the laboring people. To defeat the conspiracy of the rightists, we must resolutely defend our democratic centralism and not let the idea of "absolute democracy" infiltrate our ranks.

The leading position of the Communist Party in the political life of the country is clearly affirmed by the Constitution. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and the leadership of the Communist Party is the embodiment of the leadership of the working class. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have already achieved two great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. In the cause of building socialism, the leadership of the Communist Party is also indispensable, because building socialism is to use the worldview of the working class to transform society. The Communist Party's unshakable policy is to lead the people of the whole country to build a prosperous and happy communist society without exploitation and classes, which is the great ideal that the Chinese people have long yearned for. Is there any other party besides the Communist Party that can lead the Chinese people to realize such a great ideal? Some rightists call the leading position of the Communist Party in the political life of the country "party rule," which is a malicious slander. In fact, it is precisely under the leadership of the Communist Party that the broad masses of the Chinese people have truly become the masters of the country and can fully exert their strength to build a new life. Beijing workers say, "The China led by the Communist Party is the world of the working class, the world of the people." This is the best answer to the so-called "party rule." The saying of "party rule" is actually to regard the Communist Party as a sectarian organization that is detached from the masses and opposed to the masses, so some rightists also say that the Communist Party is the root of sectarianism, which is a completely false statement. In fact, the Communist Party has always been opposed to sectarianism. In the process of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the Communist Party has always insisted on uniting all forces that can be united, and thus formed the great unity of the revolution of the whole nation. After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, the Communist Party has also actively put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with various democratic parties. Its ultimate goal is to realize a communist society without any classes, and thus all parties, including the Communist Party, will gradually disappear. Such a party is incompatible with sectarianism. The Communist Party always educates its members to always pay attention to strengthening the contact between the party and the masses and never allows party members to treat non-party people with a sectarian attitude. The broad masses of the Chinese people trust the leadership of the Communist Party precisely because they see from the facts that the Communist Party is a genuine political party of the working class that serves the people wholeheartedly.

In the cause of building a socialist society, the worker-peasant alliance is the basic force, but at the same time, we must also unite all other classes, strata, and parties that support socialism and are willing to accept socialist transformation. The united front of people's democracy led by the Communist Party is the concrete expression of the great unity of the revolution of the whole nation. With such a united front, we can better contact and unite the broad masses of the people, reflect the opinions and demands of all aspects of the people, so that the state can timely take appropriate measures to adjust their interests and correctly handle the contradictions within the people. At the same time, through the various democratic parties and people's organizations that are united in such a united front, we can better carry out socialist ideological education and socialist transformation work and promote the development of the cause of socialist construction. The policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with various democratic parties proposed by the Communist Party is aimed at this. The broad masses of the people hope that various democratic parties will stand firmly on the socialist position, pay attention to ideological transformation, and fully play their active role in the life of the country. With the development of socialist construction, the united front of people's democracy will certainly be further consolidated and developed. Any doubts about the significance of the policy of the united front, underestimation of the role of the united front, and neglect of the work of the united front are wrong.

However, it must be affirmed that the Communist Party is the leading and core force of the united front, and socialism is the political basis of the united front, that is, the common goal of the unity and struggle of the people of the whole country. These unshakable principles are the tracks that the various democratic parties participating in the united front of people's democracy must follow, and deviating from this track is to be outside the united front.

The power organs of our country are composed of representatives of various nationalities, classes, parties, and people's organizations under the leadership of the Communist Party. The major policies of the state are all proposed by various parties through various forms of consultation and then submitted to the relevant state organs for discussion and formulation, and in the organs that implement these policies, there are representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages. This method of participating in the management of the country by various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages under the leadership of the Communist Party can better unite the people of the whole country, mobilize all positive factors to build socialism. This is a manifestation of the superiority of our country's system. The so-called two-party or multi-party rotation in power in capitalist countries is just a false democracy used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the laboring people. Now, some rightists dream of bringing this bourgeois multi-party system and "rotation of parties in power" to China to replace our people's democratic system.

In 1954, when I was entrusted by the First National People's Congress to organize the government, I proposed the composition of the State Council in accordance with the principle of the united front of people's democracy led by the Communist Party stipulated in the Constitution. At that time, the members of the government from outside the Communist Party and non-party democratic personages accounted for more than one-fourth, and later, when the government members were increased, it was roughly based on this proportion. This arrangement was determined based on the situation at that time, and it seems appropriate now.

To ensure the correct implementation of the policies of the government in various aspects, it is necessary to have a strong core leadership of the Communist Party in organs, schools, enterprises, and organizations. The principle that the Communist Party must lead everything is mainly from a political point of view and does not mean that all specific work must be directly managed by the Communist Party; on the contrary, many professional work should be handled by experts. The experts mentioned here naturally also include expert party members. As for the specific organizational forms and working methods that embody the leadership of the Communist Party, they can and should be different according to time and circumstances, so as to better play the leading role of the party and make the leadership and the led, party members and non-party people all be able to fully exert their initiative and work together. The constructive criticisms and suggestions from many people in this regard should be carefully studied. However, the outrageous demands of the rightists, such as "the Communist Party organization withdraws from organs and schools," "the Communist Party does not develop organizations among intellectuals," "the party should not have another system outside the government," "the Communist Party should step down," are all in line with the previous "bureaucratism is more dangerous than capitalism," "Political Design Institute," "Appeal Commission," "party rule," and "rotation of parties in power" and other fallacies, mutually echoing, and their purpose is to make the people's government deviate from the leadership of the working class party, so as to change the nature of our country according to their bourgeois face.

Some people criticize the phenomenon of party and government not being separated. We should analyze this issue. The party's direct political appeals and policy instructions to the people, and the government's work, not only do not hinder but also greatly help. Some decisions with political appeals and policy guidance, or some work instructions with the nature of mass movements that require the party and government to work together, are jointly issued by the party and government at the same level; some work inspections are jointly conducted by the corresponding party and government organs; some government meetings invite the relevant responsible persons of the Communist Party and other democratic parties to participate. It has been proven that these methods are beneficial to the promotion of work and should be continued in the future. However, in some organs, the party organization takes over the administrative work, or directly intervenes in some specific business without going through the administration, these phenomena are inappropriate for the government work and the party work and should be corrected.

Some people raise the issue of non-party responsible persons in state organs, schools, enterprises, and organizations having positions without power. This is based on certain facts. However, if we analyze this issue specifically, we can see that there are various different situations. One situation is that the Communist Party members and non-party personages cooperate well with each other, and there is no wall or gap between them; another situation is that some party organizations and party members do not respect the authority of non-party personages, and even adopt discriminatory and exclusionary attitudes towards them, which is a serious error of sectarian nature; the third situation is that some non-party personages do not fulfill their duties and responsibilities, and adopt distant and suspicious attitudes towards the party organizations and party members, and the relevant party organizations and party responsible cadres often do not help them enough. The latter two situations should be seriously noted and actively overcome. The key to solving this problem is that the party organization should educate its members to seriously implement the party's united front policy, overcome sectarian thoughts, respect, unite, and help non-party personages in work, humbly listen to their opinions and criticisms, learn from their expertise and experience, constantly improve themselves, and improve work. For some work systems that increase estrangement and increase estrangement, they should be changed. At the same time, non-party personages should also dare to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, eliminate their resistance to worker and peasant cadres, eliminate their suspicion and estrangement towards party members, and be open and frank, and for the shortcomings in work, they should criticize and suggest in time, and also strengthen learning, improve their ideological and cognitive level, so as to achieve the goal of close cooperation and mutual support. In the non-party personages, there are some people who still have an antagonistic attitude towards socialism, and they especially need to work hard to transform themselves and eliminate this antagonistic attitude.

The rectification movement that the Communist Party is currently carrying out is also a rectification movement in our state organs. The purpose of this rectification movement is to effectively overcome bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. For any active criticism of these erroneous thoughts and styles, even if the attitude is somewhat biased, the content is not comprehensive, and the individual facts have some discrepancies, we should adopt a welcoming attitude to consider and adopt the beneficial opinions to improve our work. Some rightists insist that bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism are the roots of proletarian dictatorship, or when criticizing the shortcomings and errors in our state organs, they equate our state organs with the state organs of the exploiting classes. These fallacies must be refuted. In the countries of bourgeois dictatorship, state organs are the tools of the bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the broad masses of the people. Such state organs are fundamentally opposed to the interests of the broad masses of the people. In such state organs, bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism are not only inevitable but also incurable. Our state organs are completely different. Socialism is the common cause of the working class and all the people, and the socialist state must and can attract the broadest masses of the people to participate in the management and supervision of state affairs. Therefore, socialism is fundamentally incompatible with bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We must and can defeat all these diseases, and the vitality of our country's basic system itself is the guarantee that we can defeat all these diseases.

Regarding domestic and international unity.

Comrades, we can all see that the Chinese people have achieved great achievements in a short period of time. Our socialist revolution has achieved basic victory; large-scale socialist construction is steadily advancing; the living standards of the people are gradually improving; the basic system of the state that adapts to the socialist economic base of our country has been established, and this system is playing a consolidating and promoting role in our country's socialist cause. What forces have we relied on to be able to move from victory to victory? Domestically, we rely on the great unity of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party. Internationally, we rely on the unity of our country with the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the unity of our country with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. Now, the more arduous and greater tasks are placed in front of us. To complete these tasks victoriously, we should further strengthen the great unity of the people of the whole country on the basis of socialism, criticize all anti-socialist thoughts, continue to eliminate the open and hidden residual counterrevolutionaries; internationally, we should further strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp and the great unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, isolate the imperialist aggression group, strive for lasting world peace and peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

When talking about the issue of the great unity of the people of the whole country, we should first explain the scope of the people. In the current stage, the people refer to all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic personages who support socialism and participate in socialist construction, that is, all people who enjoy citizen rights according to the Constitution. Those who oppose socialism and are opposed to the people are the enemies, which include counterrevolutionaries, reactionary forces and groups, and those who are currently under control and undergoing labor reform. After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, although the contradictions between the enemy and us still exist, the enemies within the country have greatly decreased, which makes the contradictions within the people stand out. It is precisely because of this that in the report to the Eleventh Enlarged Meeting of the Supreme State Council on February 27, 1957, Chairman Mao Zedong especially instructed us to be good at distinguishing the two different types of contradictions between the enemy and us and within the people, and proposed the policy and methods for correctly handling the contradictions within the people. However, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions within the people are not without the possibility of mutual transformation. Those who are currently under control and undergo labor reform can obtain citizen rights and become part of the people after reforming themselves. However, some people or groups who are currently within the people, if they insist on the anti-socialist position, resist socialist transformation, and sabotage socialist construction, they may transform from the people to the enemy.

In the current era of great changes in Chinese society, within the people, some people will temporarily feel uncomfortable with the new socialist system, and some people may even feel serious resistance. In the process of social development, people often show different states of progress, moderation, and backwardness in their thoughts and positions, often have the division of leftists, moderates, and rightists. This is determined by the objective laws of social development and the objective laws of people's ideological development, and is not artificially divided. The working class must use its worldview to transform society, which also includes transforming the positions and thoughts of other class members so that they can adapt to the requirements of social development.

The rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, although they are in the ranks of the people, stand on the anti-socialist position and even take actions that are not conducive to the socialist cause. Therefore, we must politically and ideologically draw a clear line with the rightists and carry out necessary and resolute struggles against them, so that the vast majority of truly patriotic people can see the errors of the rightists' positions and actions. Once the rightists are in a completely isolated position, they themselves will change. We hope that through external force, life experience, and their own enlightenment, the rightists can repent and accept reform. The door of socialist transformation is open to them. However, it is also possible that a small number of rightists will insist on their reactionary positions, resist reform, and even take actions to sabotage socialist construction, then they will be cut off from the people.

The solid unity of the people of the whole country on the basis of socialism is a long-term goal of struggle, and we must constantly achieve this goal through two aspects of struggle. On the one hand, we must correctly handle the contradictions within the people, seriously and earnestly overcome the thoughts and styles of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism; on the other hand, we must thoroughly criticize the rightists' speeches and actions that oppose socialism, oppose our country's basic system, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and sabotage domestic and international unity, so that the right and wrong on these most fundamental issues can be more clearly distinguished. We believe that the vast majority of the people in the country are truly patriotic and are willing to stand on the side of socialism. The rectification of the Communist Party and the self-examination of the government's work will make the contradictions within the people be constantly solved, and the errors in work be corrected. Those who try to use the contradictions within the people and the rectification of the Communist Party to stir up trouble within the people and try to sabotage our socialist cause will not succeed. On the contrary, the exposure of this conspiracy will certainly educate the people of the whole country to unite more closely around the Communist Party.

With the unity within the country, we will have more strength to consolidate our unity with the entire socialist camp and the unity with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world.

In the past year, the policy of military expansion and armament of the imperialist aggression group led by the United States has constantly threatened world peace. However, the increasingly powerful peace forces have promoted the international situation to develop in a direction that is generally favorable to the struggle of the people of the world for lasting peace and against war.

The imperialist aggression group once tried to break through in Hungary and then carry out the policy of individual annihilation against other socialist countries. However, the Hungarian people repelled the attack of the imperialists, and the socialist countries also drew profound and beneficial lessons from the Hungarian incident. As a result, the solidarity of the entire socialist camp was not weakened but strengthened. Recently, the visit of Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Prime Ministers of Czechoslovakia and Poland to our country and the series of mutual visits between the leaders of socialist countries in recent times have played an important role in consolidating the unity of the socialist camp. It has been proven that the international unity of socialism based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and national equality is unbreakable by any attempt at sowing discord.

In the past year, the Soviet Union has put forward a series of reasonable proposals on major international issues, such as disarmament, the prohibition of the use of large-scale destructive weapons, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the abolition of military bases in foreign countries and the withdrawal of armed forces from foreign countries, the convening of a summit conference of the great powers, etc., which have promoted the easing of the international situation. In order to maintain peace in the Middle East, the Soviet Union also put forward the proposal that the great powers guarantee the sovereignty and independence of the Middle Eastern countries and do not interfere in their internal affairs. These proposals of the Soviet Union are also the common position of the socialist countries. This fully proves that our socialist countries will not invade others, and we will not allow any country to invade us, and we firmly advocate peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world.

The brave Egyptian people's victory in repelling the British and French aggression and defending the sovereignty of the Suez Canal marked a new upsurge in the struggle against colonialism. This struggle is also a struggle to maintain world peace. In the past year, India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, Egypt, Syria, and other Asian and African nationalist countries have played an increasingly important role in the cause of maintaining world peace. The struggle of the Japanese people against American military occupation, for independence and freedom, and for maintaining world peace has also developed significantly. All these are important factors that promote the easing of the international situation. However, the United States is taking advantage of the weakened situation of Britain and France to vigorously seize the colonies and spheres of influence of Britain and France in the Middle East, North Africa, and other regions of the world, and strengthen the enslavement and oppression of the local people. This is the new colonial policy of the United States. Because this policy has greater deceptiveness, and because the people of some countries still lack the experience of struggle, the conspiracy of American colonialists may temporarily succeed in some countries, such as Jordan, and temporarily setback the national independence struggle of these countries' people, which is completely possible. However, the struggle for national independence and against colonialism, like any people's movement, is impossible to suppress. The more blatant interference and the more brutal enslavement and oppression of the United States will make the people of these countries more awakened and more clearly recognize the true face of American colonialism. In almost all countries controlled by the United States, the voices calling for breaking away from American control, adopting a policy of peace and neutrality, and opposing aggressive military alliances are growing louder, which proves this point. The struggle for national independence and against colonialism is a long-term, complex, and repeated, but definitely victorious struggle. Every setback and every difficulty will educate the people of various countries, raise their awareness, and enable them to finally find the correct path to lead the struggle to victory.

It is particularly noteworthy that even under the strict control of American invaders, large-scale anti-American movements have broken out in the Chinese territory of Taiwan, and this anti-American movement has precisely broken out after the United States established a missile base in Taiwan. Now, the United States has unilaterally annulled the thirteenth clause of the Korean Armistice Agreement and is preparing to transport new weapons into South Korea. The United States is doing this, on the one hand, to continue to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, threaten the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and escalate the tension in the Far East; on the other hand, it is also to suppress the people of South Korea and strengthen its colonial rule in South Korea. This shows that the United States is following the footsteps of old colonialism and has to increasingly rely on bayonets to maintain its new colonialism. It can be foreseen that the new colonialism of the United States will not have a better fate than the old colonialism. The Chinese government fully agrees with the proposal of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to convene an international conference with the participation of relevant countries and strongly condemns the unilateral action of the United States to violate the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The United States' seizure of the colonial interests of its allied countries and infringement on the sovereignty of these countries have caused these countries to have increasingly obvious centrifugal tendencies towards the United States. In the main allied countries of the United States, the trend of wanting to break away from the economic and political control of the United States and wanting to reach a reconciliation and engage in mutually beneficial exchanges with socialist countries is developing day by day. At the same time, including the people of the United States, the people of the world have launched a peace movement of increasing scale, which fully shows that the policy of military expansion and armament of the imperialist aggression group is increasingly unpopular.

The danger of war still exists. We must never relax our vigilance against the imperialist aggression group at any time. However, due to the strengthening and unity of the socialist camp, the expansion of the ranks of peace-loving countries and peoples, and the growing demand for peace among the American people, and the increasingly isolated position of the imperialist aggression group, if we can unite all the forces that can be united internationally and persist in the struggle, we will be able to promote the international situation to continue to ease and force the imperialist war group to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence.

Comrades, the international conditions for our construction of socialism are favorable. The people of our country, based on the brilliant instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong on correctly handling the contradictions within the people, are carrying out the rectification movement to overcome bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and through the victory of the struggle to expose and criticize the rightists who oppose socialism, we will achieve more solid unity. As long as we continue to work hard, strengthen domestic and international unity, and implement the policy of increasing production and saving, and building the country with thrift, there will be no force in the world that can stop our great socialist cause from advancing to victory.

　　政府工作报告
    一九五七年六月二十六日在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上
    国务院总理  周恩来各位代表：
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议闭幕以来，已经整整一年了。这是伟大的转变的一年。在这期间，我国的社会主义革命已经取得了基本胜利，使我国社会生活发生了历史性的深刻变化；社会主义建设也获得了巨大成绩，使我们有可能在今年完成和超额完成发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划。而在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践中，我们取得了许多宝贵的经验和教训，使我国社会主义事业的继续发展更加有了保证。这一年，就是以这些伟大光辉的成就载入我国史册的一年。
    关于一年来的政府工作，国务院决定由我向第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议作报告。我的报告，是依据毛泽东主席在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告所提出的方针，来检查一年来政府的工作，并且解答各方面对政府工作提出的意见。这个报告分为五个部分：（1）关于社会主义革命；（2）关于社会主义建设；  （3）关于人民生活；（4）关于国家基本制度；（5）关于国内外团结。
    一、关于社会主义革命
    1956年，我国基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业在生产资料私有制方面的社会主义改造。一亿二千万农户和五百多万个手工业者的个体经济已经变为集体经济。七万户的私营工业企业已经变为公私合营企业，将近二百万户的私营大中小商店，已经变为公私合营商店、合作商店、合作小组或者直接变为国营商店。这是把几千年来的生产资料私有制变为公有制的社会主义大革命。由于各种条件的成熟，由于共产党和人民政府的正确领导，由于全国人民的努力，在这样一个大革命的过程里，社会财产没有遭到损坏，社会秩序没有发生混乱，社会生产没有下降。恰恰相反，我们在这个大革命取得基本胜利的第一年，就在各方面取得了巨大的成绩。
    1956年的自然灾荒，不仅是我国解放以来最大的一次灾荒，也是几十年以来我国最大的一次灾荒，被灾田地约二亿三千万亩，受灾人口约七千万人。在全国实行农业合作化的第一年，我国农业就经历了这样严重灾情的考验。在党和政府的积极领导和支持下，全国农民发挥了农业生产合作社的优越性，实现了增产的要求。1956年，全国农业总产值约为五百八十三亿元，比1955年增加了二十七亿四千万元，接近了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标；粮食（不包括大豆）的产量为三千六百五十亿斤，比1955年增加了一百五十四亿斤，超过了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。在合作化的高潮中，由于大家忙于组织合作社和积肥造肥以及兴修水利等基本建设，并且把主要注意力集中在增产粮食方面，因而使某些地方一部分农村副业的发展一度受到影响。1956年，棉花和油菜子受灾最重，产量比1955年减少了。但是，在实现合作化的第一年，全国除了灾情严重的地区以外，就有百分之七十五以上的农户在不同程度上增加了收入，减少收入的农户只占百分之十左右。对于灾区，政府去年用于防汛、抢险、堵口、复堤、救济等项的支出和发放生产救灾贷款的款项共达八亿六千万元，从去年七月到现在，向灾区调运的粮食，增加了七十亿斤，而农业合作社的集体救灾和生产互助，更起了大的作用。
    1956年，由于城市和乡村的基本建设和生产同时增长，生产资料的需要骤然增大，因而使各种器材，特别是建筑材料和五金材料的供应出现了紧张情况。可是，尽管如此，1956年手工业和公私合营企业的生产和营业，也都得到了发展。这一年，手工业总产值达到一百一十七亿元，较1955年增长了百分之十六；公私合营企业的工业总产值达到了一百九十一亿元，较1955年这些企业的总产值增加了约百分之三十二。1956年，公私合营商店、合作商店和合作小组的零售总额达一百一十亿元，较1955年这些企业的零售总额增加了百分之十五以上。在全行业实行公私合营还不到一年的时间里，政府已经完成了给私方定股定息的工作，对私方人员也作了大体安排。
    人们知道，当小生产一旦变为社会主义的集体经济以后，资本主义就失去了它赖以存在和发展的基础。可以这样设想，在农业合作化和手工业合作化的高潮中，在社会主义经济的大发展中，如果政府对私营工商业不采取一视同仁、合理安排和进行改造的方针，或者私营工商业者不参加公私合营而拒绝改造的话，那么，二百多万户私营工商业的生产和营业不仅不能得到发展，并且必然会处于被削弱以至被淘汰的地位，而私营企业的职工和一部分从业人员就会遇到失业和转业的困难。这不仅对国家和人民不利，对工商业者更加不利。党和政府从开国以来，就把私营工商业放在国家的统筹安排之内，实行利用、限制和改造的政策。而私营工商业者就在1956年大势所趋人心所向的形势下，接受了全行业公私合营的办法，从而使全国私营工商业基本上完成了在生产资料私有制方面的社会主义改造。
    我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的三大社会主义改造能够同时基本上完成，并不是偶然的，而是我国的历史发展所准备好了的。1949年，资产阶级民主革命在全国范围内取得胜利后，我国革命就进入了社会主义革命时期。接着，我们先后进行了土地改革、抗美援朝、肃清反革命、三反五反和思想改造的五大运动。土地改革彻底摧毁了封建基础。抗美援朝击退了美帝国主义对新中国的挑战，破除了我国一部分人的特别是许多知识分子的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想。肃清反革命运动相当彻底地打击了各种反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政。三反五反，击退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，创造了对私营工商业实行社会主义改造的有利条件。思想改造运动，批判了许多反动思想，初步解决了大多数知识分子为谁服务的问题。
　　显而易见，如果没有这些运动的胜利，便不可能在新中国成立不久的短短时间内，就取得社会主义革命的基本胜利。这些运动都是在党的领导下以群众性的斗争形式进行的，因为不采取这种形式，便不可能把广大人民群众动员起来取得运动的胜利，同时也不能使群众在运动中得到锻炼，提高觉悟，为三大改造铺平道路。由此可知，对于五大运动无论就其成绩来说，也无论就其进行的形式来说，都是不应该怀疑的。五大运动的胜利保证了三大改造能够顺利地进行。三大改造本身也是有准备有步骤地进行的。对农业的社会主义改造，是经过了从互助组到低级合作社再到高级合作社的发展过程。对手工业的社会主义改造，是经过了从供销小组、分散生产联合经营等低级形式到手工业合作社的高级形式、从小规模的手工业合作社到规模较大的手工业合作社的发展过程。对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是经过了从加工订货、统购包销到部分的公私合营再到全行业的公私合营的发展过程。同时，三大改造又是相互联系配合起来进行的。了解了上述五大运动和三大改造的历史发展过程及其相互关系，就可以了解在涉及六万万人民生活的历史大变革后的第一年，工农业生产不仅能够正常进行而且能够获得很大发展的根本原因。
    在上述巨大的群众性运动中，在具体工作上是发生过一些偏差和错误的。政府对于这些偏差和错误，有的已经作了检查和处理，有的正在检查。我们欢迎全国人民继续提出批评和建议。当然，我们在检查偏差和错误的时候，要分析主观的和客观的原因，要分析在当时那些偏差和错误是可以避免的，那些是不能完全避免甚至是无法避免的。这样，我们才能判明这些偏差和错误的性质、程度和范围。对于那些在当时条件下确实可以避免的偏差和错误，我们必须引以为戒，坚决纠正；对于在运动中受到不应有的损害的人，我们应该公开向他们道歉；在运动中没有处理完毕的问题，现在应该由有关机关迅速予以处理。
    但是，历次运动中发生的偏差和错误，是掩盖不了当时产生这些运动的客观需要和历次运动的基本成绩的。以思想改造运动来说，由于这个运动也是以群众运动的形式进行的，某些问题的处理是比较粗糙的，因而损伤了一些从旧社会来的、资产阶级的知识分子的自尊心。但是，通过思想改造运动，确实帮助了知识分子的绝大多数基本上渡过了社会主义革命这一关。在这次整风运动中，知识分子的绝大多数都表示赞成社会主义，就是证明。再以肃清反革命运动来说，在政府历年来处理的反革命分子中，计有以下四类：
  （一）因积恶累累民愤极大而判处死刑的占百分之十六点八，其中绝大多数是从解放后到1952年判处的，这在当时是绝对必要的；（二）实行劳动改造的占百分之四十二点三，其中已经刑满释放或者安置生产的占百分之二十五点六，现在在押实行劳动改造的占百分之十六点七；（三）实行管制的占百分之三十二，其中已经解除了管制的占百分之二十二点九，现在仍管制的占百分之九点一；（四）逮捕后宽大处理、教育释放的占百分之八点九。由此可知，在这些反革命分子中，有百分之五十七点四是经过劳动改造或者宽大处理而得到释放和撤消了管制的，他们已经获得了重新做人的机会，其余仍在劳动改造或者管制中的，只要他们认罪守法，老老实实地接受改造，也将会得到重新做人的机会。根据政府的初步检查，对这些反革命分子的处理，有偏差的是极少数，而绝大多数是完全正确的。有人认为肃反的偏差竟达到百分之九十以上，这是完全没有根据的。毛泽东主席已经提出还要对这一运动进行一次检查，我们相信，检查的结果会继续证明这一点。
    过去进行的五大运动，或者是民主革命的彻底完成，或者是社会主义革命的组成部分。因此，决不能拿革命运动中个别的乃至部分的错误来动摇革命运动的成果。即使在个别单位甚至个别地区发生的错误比较严重，也依然不能否定这些运动的成果。党和政府每当提倡一种运动的时候，都是根据客观的迫切需要，经过慎重研究和典型试验才提出的，而每次运动又动员了广大群众参加并且得到他们的拥护。这样就保证了运动的成绩是基本的，偏差和错误是个别的。有人认为，如果我们说这些运动的成绩是基本的，偏差和错误是个别的，这就是“教条主义”，这就是“公式”和“新八股”。实际上，这些人提出反对“教条主义”、反对“公式”和“新八股”等等口号，就是为了夸大错误、抹煞成绩，引导一些立场不稳或者不明是非的人把这些个别性质或者部分性质的偏差和错误，看成是这些运动的根本性质或者全面性质的错误，以达到他们动摇革命运动成果、反对社会主义革命的目的。
    我们说社会主义革命基本上胜利了，大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本上结束了，但是这并不是说，阶级斗争已经结束了。我们现在着重地提出要正确地处理人民内部矛盾，但是这并不是说，现在就没有敌我矛盾了。应该指出，目前在国内还有阶级存在，地主阶级、官僚资产阶级虽然已经早被消灭，但是这些阶级的分子，还正在劳动中、生活中改造着，而他们固有的阶级思想和阶级感情，还不可能完全改变。私营工商业者的绝大部分虽然参加了公私合营，但是由于他们还拿定息，对工人阶级还有剥削关系，因而资产阶级的两面性依然存在。例如，有人主张或者赞成把股息延长到二十年，有人想要把二十年的股息一次付清，有人说股息不是剥削，仅仅是“不劳而获”，说资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别，甚至说“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”。这些谬论都是由于资产阶级的唯利是图、贪得无餍的剥削思想的一面在作祟，都是为资本主义复辟的企图打掩护。有少数资本家主张公方代表退出公私合营企业，更是拒绝社会主义改造的一种露骨的表现。这不是明明白白地表明资产阶级还存在着两面性吗？这不是明明白白地说明资产阶级分子还有继续改造的必要吗？对资产阶级分子的社会主义改造，就是要他们进行自我批判，逐步改变资产阶级的立场和思想感情，也就是要他们得到“脱胎换骨”的本质改造。要作到这一点，又非经长期的改造功夫不可。这对绝大多数愿意接受社会主义改造的工商业者来说，又有什么不好呢？现在不是已经有越来越多的工商业者认识到了这一点吗？由上述情形看来，在人民内部矛盾中，目前还存在着资产阶级同工人阶级对抗的一面，还存在着严重的阶级斗争，更不必说在人民内部之外，还存在着我们同国内的反革命分子和国外的帝国主义的敌我矛盾了。正如大家已经明白看到的，在这次整风运动中，有思想斗争，也有政治斗争。因此，当我们正确处理人民内部矛盾的时候，绝不能无视还有阶级斗争的存在，也不能无视还有敌我矛盾的存在。巩固社会主义革命的成果，继续进行和彻底完成社会主义改造，还是我们今后的一项重要任务。
    二、关于社会主义建设
    我国的社会主义建设是同社会主义革命同时进行的。在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，我们已经正确地规划了建设和改造相结合的步骤。而1956年，伴随着社会主义改造的高潮的到来，我国的社会主义建设有了一个跃进的发展，经济事业和文教事业的发展规模和速度，都大大地超过了五年计划的前三年，有些甚至超过了前三年增长的总和。
    现在我举出一些数字说明这个情况。
    我国的工业总产值（不包括手工业产值，下同），在五年计划的前三年共增加了一百七十七亿元，而1956年这一年就增加了一百三十九亿元。正是由于这种迅速的发展，1956年的工业总产值达到了五百八十六亿元，超过了五年计划所要求的1957年的指标。从主要工业产品看，钢产量前三年共增加了一百五十万吨，而1956年就增加了一百六十一万吨。金属切削机床的制造，前三年由于调整设备和改变型号的原因，虽然在台数上比1952年没有显著的增加，但是在新的品种增加和质量的提高方面，都有了很大的发展，到1956年，在这一新的基础上，又比1955年增加了一万二千二百多台。此外，如电力、煤炭、石油、化学肥料、水泥等重工业产品，1956年的产量比前三年的年产量都有较多的增加。喷气式飞机、载重汽车、大型发电设备和单轴自动车床等重要新产品也都是在这一年制造成功的。轻工业生产由于1955年农业丰收的有利条件，增长速度很快。例如，棉纱产量前三年共增加了三十五万件，而1956年就增加了一百二十七万件；棉布的产量前三年共增加了二千零五十万匹，而1956年就增加了四千三百万匹；食糖产量前三年共增加了十六万吨，而1956年就增加了将近十一万吨。
    1956年，我国的农业在严重的自然灾害中，如前所说，总产值仍然增加了二十七亿四千万元，超过了前三年平均每年增加二十三亿八千万元的水平。1956年，在国家和农业合作社的通力合作下，农业建设有了很大的发展。前三年共开垦荒地三千六百万亩，而1956年就开垦荒地二千九百万亩；前三年扩大的灌溉面积共四千一百多万亩，而1956年就扩大了一亿多亩。
    1956年全国完成了将近一百四十亿元的基本建设投资额，等于五年计划规定的投资总额的三分之一，因而改变了前三年基本建设投资只完成五年计划一半稍多的情况，使前四年完成的比重达到百分之八十六，这就保证了第一个五年的基本建设计划能够超额完成。1956年新增加的钢的生产能力，就有一百四十二万吨；新建和修复的铁路，就有三千一百零八公里。
    同生产和建设的迅速发展相适应，1956年在运输方面和贸易方面，也都有很大的发展。全国现代运输工具前三年的货运量共增加了一亿一千二百万吨，而1956年就增加了九千三百万吨；商业机构零售总额前三年共增加了一百一十三亿元，而1956年就增加了六十二亿元。
    1956年文化教育事业也有了很大的发展。
    显然，1956年的建设成就是极其巨大的。这就使国家有比较充足的力量来支援新生的合作社经济和公私合营经济，从而加强了社会主义经济的阵地，巩固了社会主义革命的胜利；同时，又保证了我国第一个五年计划的各项指标有可能比较顺利地完成和超额完成，从而准备了实行第二个五年计划的有利条件。
    1956年政府对国家建设工作的安排，总的说来是正确的，但是也存在着不少的缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误，将要在李先念、薄一波两位副总理代表国务院分别作的关于国家预算的报告和关于国民经济计划的报告中详细指出。1956年预算开支中的某些项目和国民经济计划中的某些指标，是大了一些。从财政方面说，执行国家预算的结果，当年支出超过当年收入十八亿三千万元，动用了历年财政结余十六亿五千万元，并且从银行透支了一亿八千万元，银行发行货币也多了一些，因而动用了库存物资大约二十亿元。从经济和文教方面说，基本建设投资多了十五亿元到二十亿元，同时，职工的人数增加多了，高等和中等学校的新生也招多了，一部分职工的工资也增加得多了一些。因此，虽然1956年我国生产资料工业的产值增长了百分之四十一，生活资料工业的产值增长了百分之二十二，但是这两种物资的供应都较紧张，并且减少了国家的物资后备力量。在造成物资供应紧张的原因中，主要是基本建设投资额大了一些，“摊子”铺得多了一些，这样就多增加了财政的开支，多增加了职工人数和工资总额，也就多增加了生产资料和生活资料的消耗。
    对于1956年的基本建设工作，我们应该进行具体的分析。由于许多建设项目在前三年已经完成了土木建筑工程，需要在1956年进行大量的设备安装工程，另有许多项目已经完成了设计和施工准备工作，需要在1956年开始大量施工，并且还由于设计和施工力量的壮大，设备自给能力的增长，需要在1956年安排一些新的项目，这样，就使基本建设的项目大大地增加了。现在从建设项目来看，大多数是安排得恰当的，有小部分动工过早了，或者进度过快了，也有个别项目，是安排得不恰当的。不恰当的项目，显然是错误的。那些动工过早和进度过快的项目，在当年确实造成一些损失，但是，对于长远的建设事业还是需要的。同时，有一些项目，主要是一些非生产性的项目，由于建筑标准过高，造成不少浪费。这些，都应该引为教训，今后力求避免。
    由于基本建设投资多了所造成的某些物资供应紧张的情况，我们在1956年的第二、三季度就已经开始察觉，并且采取了一些措施，制止了供应紧张情况的继续发展。以后在编制1957年的国民经济计划草案和国家预算草案的时候，我们就吸取这个教训，缩减了一部分基本建设投资，适当地增加了国家的后备。
    这次提交大会审议的1957年度的国家预算草案和发展国民经济计划草案的各种数字表明，我们的社会主义建设事业是以既积极又充分可靠的步骤向前发展的。1957年的国家预算收入比1956年增长近百分之二；为了避免像去年那样在财政上出现赤字的现象，国家预算支出比1956年减少百分之四。1957年的工业总产值比1956年将增长百分之四点五，达到六百零三亿元。农业总产值比1956年将增长百分之四点九，达到六百一十一亿元。基本建设投资缩减为一百一十一亿元，它虽然比1956年减少百分之二十，但是比五年计划原定的1957年投资还多十四亿元，五年合计，仍然超过五年计划原定数约五十亿元。在1957年已经过去的五个多月时间内，预算和计划的执行情况，一般地是良好的。如果全国人民能够厉行增产节约，贯彻执行勤俭建国方针，争取农业丰收，而不遭受大的自然灾害，那么我们就能够顺利地完成1957年的各项指标，也就能够保证完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划，从而奠定社会主义工业化的初步基础。关于我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会提出了建议，国务院接受了这个建议，并且正在由有关部门具体制订中。
    应该指出，我国在第一个五年计划建设中所已经取得和将要取得的伟大成就，是同苏联人民和苏联政府的援助分不开的。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助设计和供应设备的共有一百五十六个建设项目，苏联给我国提供了大量的长期的优惠贷款，并且派遣了大批的技术专家帮助我们进行各项建设工作。这种真诚的援助，值得我们再一次向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。现在还有人企图抹煞苏联对我国真诚援助的巨大意义，这显然是在有意挑拨中苏友谊，破坏国际团结，从而破坏我国的社会主义建设事业。
    对于我国社会主义建设的成就，最近一个时期，有些人却有着不同的看法和估计。
    有人认为，我国的发展国民经济计划在1956年全面冒进了，在1957年又全面冒退了。很明显，这种意见是不正确的。我国1956年的计划，是在改造和建设的高潮中拟定的。社会主义革命的基本胜利，大大鼓舞了劳动人民建设社会主义的积极性，他们纷纷要求增加生产，提高工作定额。1955年农业的大丰收，又为国民经济的发展准备了物质条件。同时，基本建设发展到了五年计划的第四个年度，也确实有扩大规模的必要。这些情况，都说明我们不但需要而且有可能加快建设的速度。1956年的计划就是适应这种情况，采取了跃进的步骤，而且在各方面取得了如前所说的巨大成就。不错，某些指标是大了一些。但是，这是属于局部性质的缺点。即使以基本建设投资多了十五亿元到二十亿元来说，也只占去年全部支出的百分之五到百分之六，仍然是局部性质的缺点。因此，决不能说1956年的建设是全面冒进。1957年，由于去年农业收成的情况不好，同时国家的财政和物资的后备力量也有减少，在这种情况下，适当地放慢建设的步骤，积蓄力量，准备今后更好地前进，是完全必要的，这决不是全面冒退。我们应该懂得，任何事情都不会是直线发展的。随着客观条件的变化，发展速度总会有快有慢，并且常常会出现不平衡。社会主义建设事业的发展也是这样。尤其是像我们这样人多且穷的国家，由于农业的比重很大，自然灾害时常发生，要求国民经济年年都毫无起伏地按照同样的速度向前发展，这是一种不切实际的想法。
    有人认为我国第一个五年计划搞坏了，这是完全错误的。无论从工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、文化教育或者财政收支那一方面来看，我国第一个五年计划都是成功的，是搞好了而不是搞坏了。以1957年的计划数字同1952年的实际数字作比较，我国的工业总产值增长一点二倍，即增加三百三十三亿元。以钢的产量来说，第一个五年合计将达到一千六百三十万吨，而旧中国包括日本侵略时候的东北在内，从1900年到1948年，四十九年合计的钢产量不过七百六十万吨。当然，拿目前我国钢的产量同工业发达的国家的产量来比还是很低的。因此，优先发展重工业同时充分注意发展农业和轻工业的方针，今后仍然应该继续坚持。我国1957年的农业计划如果完成，农业总产值比1952年将增长百分之二十六，即增加一百二十七亿六千万元。以粮食和棉花来说，1952年到1956年五年间的实际产量合计，粮食为一万六千五百八十亿斤，棉花为一亿三千万担，而旧中国从1932年到1936年五年间是我国解放前农业收成比较好的年份，粮食产量合计只一万三千亿斤，棉花产量合计只六千零五十万担。不要忘记，在1952年到1956年这个期间，还有两个大的灾荒年。在第一个五年计划期间内，我们开工建设的有八百多个限额以上的工业企业，许多水利工程和铁路工程以及长江大桥工程等等，规模都比较大，技术都比较新，其中由苏联帮助设计和供应设备的一百五十六项建设工程，在技术上都是头等的。这些建设工程对我国的社会主义工业化事业和农业生产的发展，不仅在第一个五年内已经发挥了巨大的作用，而且在今后将要发挥更大的作用。这些建设工程，多数都是旧中国时代所不能想像的。第一个五年期间铁路共新建八千五百公里，而国民党政府在二十二年的统治期间只修建了二千六百多公里。我国的文化教育事业在这期间也有了巨大的发展，例如高等学校的毕业生，第一个五年合计为二十八万人，这就为新中国培养出大批的建设人材，而旧中国从1912年到1947年，三十六年合计不过二十一万多人。拿财政的情况来说，第一个五年合计的财政收支各为一千三百六十九亿一千四百万元，收支是平衡的。其中国外借款收入三十一亿元，只占国家预算收入的百分之二点三。这充分地说明了我国基本上是依靠内部的积累进行了大规模的建设的。五年的财政支出，用于国家建设事业的约占百分之六十以上；经济建设事业和社会文教事业的支出的比重是逐年增加的，行政和国防支出的比重是逐年降低的。这就充分地证明了我国的第一个五年计划，是和平的经济建设和文化建设的计划。我国在进行大规模建设的同时，由于生产的发展，人民生活有了相应的改善，这一点，我将在报告的下一部分加以说明。我国第一个五年计划的伟大成就，是无可否认的。那种说第一个五年计划搞坏了的人，他们对社会主义事业抱着敌对的态度，故意抹煞全国人民辛勤劳动的成果。这样的人，他们最不高兴社会主义计划经济而向往资本主义经济。但是，他们的困难是，全国广大人民并不站在资本主义那一边，而是坚决地站在社会主义这一边。
    有人认为统购统销糟透了，这是直接地攻击了社会主义经济制度。社会主义的计划经济在中国是为六万万人的生活着想的，这同资本主义的自由竞争只顾少数人发财享受不顾多数人死活，是根本不相同的。我国人口众多，经济还很落后，生活消费品的供应因而不能很充足；我国的农业，有时丰收，有时歉收，并且往往这里丰收，那里歉收，为了照顾这种不平衡情况，必须在丰收的年份和地区照顾到歉收的年份和地区，并且还必须准备应付特别严重的自然灾害和其他意外；我国的工业和运输业的建设正在大规模地进行，城市人口也在不断增加；这种种情况，说明了在我们这样的国家里，如果不对粮食和其他主要生活消费品实行统购统销，进行合理的分配，那么，广大劳动人民的生活就无法保证，社会主义建设的事业就无法顺利进行。因此，对于粮食和其他主要生活消费品的统购统销，是我国社会主义经济在分配方面的一项重要政策。四年来实践证明，这个政策保证了城乡人民都能够得到他们所最必需的价格合理的生活消费品，免受私商的剥削，即使在发生灾荒的年份和灾害严重的地区也是如此。这个政策支援了工业建设，保证了市场的稳定，从而有助于我国社会主义事业的顺利发展。怎么能够认为统购统销糟透了呢？抱有这种观点的人，不是贪图少数人的自由享受，便是迷恋资本主义的自由竞争，想达到个人发财的目的。我们批判这种错误观点，并不是否认在统购统销方面存在着某些缺点。例如对粮食的统购统销工作，一度曾经因为供应过宽，不得不增加收购，在某些地区就发生购粮过多、留粮过少的现象。又如，对棉布的统销工作，去年棉布增产较多，供应宽了一些，今年棉布减产，不得不减少供应。这都是由于政府在工作中瞻前顾后和统筹安排不够所产生的缺点。对于各种缺点，政府将继续注意检查和改正。
    有人反对学习苏联经验，甚至认为我国在建设工作中发生的缺点和错误，也是学习苏联的结果。这是一种极端有害的看法。我们认为，向苏联学习是完全必要的，问题在于我们自己如何学习。如果学习得不好，责任完全在于我们。苏联是世界上第一个建成社会主义的国家，有着丰富的先进经验，我们从事社会主义建设，不向苏联学习，难道向美国学习建设资本主义的经验么？事实上，正是因为我们认真地学习了苏联的先进经验，才使我们的建设工作少走了许多弯路，获得了很大的成绩。当然，我们不应该硬搬别国的经验，即使是他们成功的经验，也必须有所选择，并且在运用的时候，还必须同本国的具体情况结合起来。我们正在做前人所没有做过的事业，当我们还没有经过实践的时候，对别国的经验要选择恰当并不容易，要做到同本国的具体情况相结合就更不容易。提高选择能力和学会正确运用，不但要有一定的时间，而且可能要付出一定的代价。如果学习得好，可以缩短时间，也可以少付代价。因此，我们必须继续努力，批判和克服教条主义的学习方法。同时，我们又必须批判那些把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联的先进经验都当作教条而加以否定的修正主义观点。而在目前，正当右派分子用修正主义反对社会主义的时候，我们反对修正主义就有更重要的意义。应该肯定，在今后我们还要认真地向苏联学习，向一切社会主义国家学习。当然，其他国家一切对人民有益的知识和经验，只要有可能，我们也都要加以学习。
    下面我想对于教育改革和向科学进军两个问题讲一些意见。
　　关于教育改革问题。
　　一定的文化是一定社会的政治和经济在观念形态上的反映，并且是为这种政治和经济服务的。旧中国的教育，主要是推行奴化教育、封建教育和资产阶级教育，是为帝国主义和国内少数统治阶级服务的。新中国的教育与旧中国的教育根本不同，必须反映社会主义的新政治、新经济，必须为广大劳动人民服务，必须适应我们国家社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要。因此，我们就有必要对接收过来的旧教育作根本性质的改革。几年来，我们作了这样的改革，并且有了很大的成绩。这是必须肯定的。今后随着社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的发展，我们还应该继续进行某些必要的改革。过去，教育部门在实行教育改革的时候，也发生过若干偏差，主要是否定了旧教育的某些合理的部分，对解放区革命教育的经验没有做出系统的总结，加以继承，并且在学习苏联经验的时候同我国实际情况结合不够。这些缺点今后应该改正。但是，如果有人因为教育改革中有这些缺点，就否定教育改革的成绩是基本的，甚至根本否认教育改革的必要性，企图使今天的教育走回到旧中国教育的老路上去，那是完全错误的。
    在教育改革中比较突出的一个问题，是高等学校的院系调整和教学改革的问题。旧中国的高等学校，由于要适应帝国主义和国内反动统治的需要，畸形地集中在沿海大城市，而且大多数院系庞杂重复，培养目标笼统模糊。各科中工科所占的比重很小，教学内容绝大部分是袭用资本主义国家的一套。旧教育的这种情况根本不能适应我国建设社会主义的需要。同时，在解放后头几年的国际形势和内地新工业基地的建设，又要求有一部分学校实行内迁。在这种情况下，教育部门和各个高等学校几年来进行了院系调整和教学改革的巨大工作，使我国高等教育的面貌发生了根本的变化，大体上能够适应培养社会主义建设人材的需要。但是，教育部门在进行调整和改革的过程中是有缺点的，例如，对某些学校安排不当，对老教师的意见和经验重视不够等等。我们应该很好地总结这些经验，肯定成绩，克服缺点。今后应该力求保持高等学校的稳定，以利于教学质量的提高。并且要更好地结合我国的实际，稳步地改进现有的专业设置、教学计划和教材。
    从最近整风运动暴露出来的情况看来，我们应该特别加强学校的思想政治工作。首先，学校教师是培养下一代的灵魂工程师，他们应该在过去思想改造的基础上，根据自愿的原则，继续进行自我教育和自我改造。过去教师的思想改造是有成绩的，但是这次整风运动证明，要使教师们掌握无产阶级的思想武器，能够在阶级斗争的风浪中站稳立场，明辨是非，引导学生朝着正确方向前进，是不容易的。因此，他们应该继续努力，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，使自己具备正确的政治观点，加强自己的劳动观点，逐步地同工农打成一片。其次，各级教育部门和学校教师要针对着学生的思想情况，加强对学生的思想政治教育，培养他们成为忠实于社会主义事业的、勤劳朴素的、体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的国家建设人才。政治教育的教材和方法，过去有脱离实际的缺点，今后应该总结经验，加以改进。几年来，学校的政治教师作了不少的工作，今后他们应该继续努力，提高自己的水平，发挥更大的力量。
    现在我来谈谈学生毕业后参加劳动的问题。我国国民经济的发展要求工农劳动人民的文化水平不断提高，要求大批有文化的知识青年参加劳动者的队伍。解放以来，我国小学、中学和高等学校都有了很大的发展。由于要适应国家对高级和中级建设人才的迫切需要，高等学校和中等专业学校招生较多。这样，就造成了近几年来高中毕业生几乎全部升学、初中毕业生大部分升学、只有一小部分参加工农业生产的现象。特别是去年，高等学校和中等专业学校都多招了一部分学生，初中和高中毕业生的升学率就更加增高了。但是，应该指明，这种现象却是暂时的和不正常的现象，经过国家的妥善安排以后，它将逐渐地转入正常的状态。今年高等学校和中等专业学校都将根据计划少招一些学生，今后我国的各级教育都将在国民经济发展的基础上稳步地发展。因此，今后，一方面每年将会有更多的小学、初中、高中的毕业生升学；另一方面，每年又会有越来越多的小学、初中、高中的毕业生投入生产劳动。这才能使我国有文化的体力劳动者日益增加，知识分子的队伍日益扩大。这才是正常的和健康的现象，也将是今后长时期内存在的现象。
    旧中国的教育是为地主资产阶级所垄断的，从小学起，特别是从中学到大学和出国留学，劳动人民是很少有份的。新中国的情形就根本不同。我们的教育是属于劳动人民的。近几年来，我国劳动人民的生活逐步改善，他们想把子弟送进学校学习的要求更加迫切了。因此，尽管我国的各级教育事业几年来的发展在速度上和规模上都超过我国历史上的任何时代，但是，总不能满足人民群众日益增长的要求。我们的教育事业只能在生产发展的基础上逐步地发展，而不可能把好事在一天之内办完。
    我们今后的教育方针，应该是培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者。过去这个方针是不够明确的。我们的中小学学生毕业后除了一小部分升学以外，多数都应该参加工农业生产。高等学校中也应该加强劳动教育，学生毕业后一般地应该参加一定的体力劳动，今后应该对此定出一些制度，逐步实施。过去教育行政部门对劳动教育重视不够，没有采取切实可行的措施，同时社会上特别是一部分干部中还有“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，“学而优则仕”的剥削阶级思想的残余，因而造成了不少青年学生轻视体力劳动，轻视工农劳动人民，毕业后不愿参加工农业生产劳动的不健康现象。我们应该向所有的青年学生确切地讲明，我们的国家就是因为有劳动人民当家作主，才有着无限光明的前途。在我们的国家里，劳动是最光荣的事情，工人和农民是最有前途的人。青年学生都应该把参加工农业生产劳动看作最大的光荣，同时又应该认识，参加工农业生产劳动是有困难的。新中国的青年应该不怕艰苦，下定决心吃苦，老老实实地劳动。全国学生的家长们和社会舆论都应该鼓励学生参加生产劳动，特别是农业生产劳动，要继续批判一部分家长和干部轻视体力劳动，阻挠学生参加工农业生产劳动的错误思想和行动。教育部门应该根据上述教育方针，在过去几年教育改革的基础上，对现行的教育制度、教育内容和教学法，彻底地稳步地加以改进。
    我还简单地谈谈派遣出国留学生的问题。七年来我国派遣了七千多人出国留学，派遣的标准一般是按照政治、业务和体格三个条件，这是对的。为了培养忠实于社会主义事业的高级知识分子，在社会主义革命基本胜利以前，我们对于派遣出国的留学生，曾经特别着重政治条件的审查，这是完全必要的。值得引为教训的，是当时在审查政治条件的工作中有形式主义的缺点，因而还有个别政治品质不好的学生也被派出去了。同时，对留学生的业务和体格条件也有注意不够的地方。我们决定今后一般不派高中毕业生，只派大学毕业生和研究生去学习国内所缺的专业。选派留学生，在任何时候都应该重视政治条件的审查，而且要克服上述的各种缺点。有人认为过去派遣出国的留学生中，革命干部的子女占多了。事实怎样呢？根据已有的统计材料，从1952年到1956年，我们派出留学生六千四百三十五人，其中革命干部的子女还不到百分之三点五。由此可知，那种说法是完全不符合事实的。
　　关于向科学进军。
　　以往一年，在“向科学进军”的号召下，我国科学事业有了重要的发展。1956—1967年科学发展远景规划已经制订，并且已经作为试行草案，付诸实施。在自然科学方面，已经试制了1957年的年度计划。国务院科学规划委员会已经成为常设机构。各方面科学研究机构有了较大的发展，科学工作者的队伍也有了扩大。科学工作体制的原则已经确定。科学工作中的协作制度，已经开始推行。关于图书仪器等科学工作条件的问题，已经或者正在拟定方案，逐步加以解决。有些重要的科学实验设备正在建设中。苏联帮助我国建设的功率为七千瓩的重水型原子反应堆和能产生二千五百万电子伏的α粒子的回旋加速器，正在加紧建设中。科学研究，一年来也有不少成就。所有这些，都鼓舞了广大科学工作者向科学进军的热情，同时，各部门、各地方对科学事业也表现了很大的积极性。
    在广大的爱国知识分子向科学进军的热潮中，却有人说，中国科学事业在解放后比国民党时代落后了，甚至有人说，今后十二年不是赶上国际水平的问题，
  而是补过去十二年课的问题，好像从解放以来，我们在科学方面不仅没有丝毫成绩，而且是倒退了一样。我们能够同意这种说法吗？请看事实：第一，现有科学事业的规模，虽然离我们国家建设的需要还很远，但是，无论在研究人员、机构、经费和设备各方面，都比国民党时代大得多。第二，在科学技术的水平方面，也不是国民党时代所能比拟的。首先是许多老的科学研究机构在研究工作上有了新的发展，同时，许多新的学科建立起来了，特别是发展了一些与工业建设和国防直接有关的学科和新技术。高等学校也开设了大批新的专业。第三，新中国科学事业的特点，是科学和生产的密切结合。生产对于科学是基本的推动力量。在国民党时代，由于工农业生产的衰落，科学家们虽然也作了些研究工作，但是无法在生产上发挥作用。解放后八年来，随着生产的发展，生产部门向科学研究部门提出了大量的要求，我们科学家们在这方面就有了充分的机会来发挥他们的才能，而且已经取得了很大的成绩，但是，我们的科学研究力量，还远远不能满足生产的需要。第四，全国社会科学的研究，在马克思主义正确方向的指导下，在批判资产阶级社会科学的斗争中也获得了新的发展。这样的发展，在国民党时代是完全不可能设想的。社会科学有强烈的阶级性，在革命胜利以后，我们对资产阶级社会科学采取批判的态度，是完全必要的。第五，科学队伍也在迅速壮大中。老科学家们经过思想改造和工作实践，他们的政治觉悟和业务能力一般地都提高了。留学生陆续回国，增强了各门学科的力量。大批高等学校学生毕业，为我国科学的发展准备了雄厚的后备力量。根据以上种种，怎么能说新中国的科学事业比国民党时代还落后呢？还要补过去十二年的课呢？我们这样说，并不是否认中国科学家在国民党时代非常困苦的条件下所做的努力和获得的成就，而且我们从来就把他们这些得来不易的成就作为中国科学财富的组成部分。说新中国科学落后于国民党时代的人，无非是否认我们科学家八年来的成就，否认社会主义制度的优越性罢了。
    对于科学规划，有人表示怀疑。他们认为科学事业不可能作全国性的长期的规划，只能由科学家自发地分散地进行。在社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，在知识分子向科学进军的热潮中，为了推进社会主义建设，我们邀集了几百个科学家，集中他们的智慧，制出我国科学发展的初步蓝图，使我国科学事业的发展有了大体的轮廓和途径，这是十分必要的。科学技术研究的基本任务，是为了发展生产，同自然界做斗争。如果不把我国现有的科学力量适当地组织起来，密切地联系社会主义建设的需要，作出比较全面的和长期的规划，那么，我国科学事业的发展，就没有了方向，就不可能收到我们预期的效果。当然，这个规划，以后必须根据各种新的情况，不断地加以补充和修正，甚至可能有很大的改变。即使如此，也不能否定这个规划的必要性，因为没有今天的初步蓝图，就不可能有将来日益完备的科学工作计划。社会主义经济是有计划的经济，为社会主义经济建设服务的科学事业，也必须是有计划的。在国家规划之外，无疑也应该允许科学家从事他们自己所专长的某些研究工作，以便充分发挥科学家的潜力。但是，反对科学研究工作的计划性，使科学事业陷于无政府状态中，这对社会主义、对科学事业本身都是不利的。
    为了有效地发展我国科学研究工作，必须贯彻协作的原则。各有关部门必须协调地进行工作。政府今年在医学、农学和机械等方面，已经制定较好的协调方案，并且已经部分地见诸实行。这种作法，为国家节约了大量的人力和物力，并且加速了科学工作的开展，以后应该加以推广。有人只赞成本部门科学工作的发展，不赞成甚至要求限制其他部门科学工作的发展，他们往往反对协调工作，甚至拒绝国家对人力和物力的合理调配，这是一种严重的本位主义作风，应该加以批判。全国科学研究力量，应该统筹安排，一方面是适当分工，另一方面更重要的是密切协作；一方面要提倡“百家争鸣”，另一方面也要反对因门户之见而妨碍协作。我国的科学研究工作系统，应该由中国科学院、高等学校、中央各产业部门的研究机构和地方的研究机构四个方面组成。在这个系统中，中国科学院是全国学术领导和重点研究的中心，高等学校、中央各产业部门的研究机构（包括厂矿实验室）和地方所属的研究机构是我国科学研究的广阔基地。这是组织我国科学队伍的原则问题，我们要求有关部门的负责干部认真地提倡协作精神，推行协调方案，迅速克服本位主义的不良作风。
    新中国科学事业的发展，是中国科学家在中国共产党和人民政府领导下努力的结果。有人认为，中国共产党和人民政府不能领导科学工作，目前许多领导人都不是科学家，“外行”不能领导“内行”。有人甚至认为，国务院科学规划委员会的存在是不信任中国科学家的表现。中国共产党和人民政府从来就教育自己的干部不断地在工作中学习自己所不熟悉的事情，逐步提高自己的业务能力，做好工作。对于科学事业的领导有两个方面，一方面是学术领导，另一方面是政治思想上和行政上的领导。对于学术问题，我们从来不主张用行政命令进行干涉，我们的领导方针是“百家争鸣”，就是通过科学界的自由争论和客观实践来解决学术问题。对于科学工作中的政治思想、方针、政策、计划等方面，更需要党和政府的领导。八年来的事实，已经证明了这一点。国务院科学规划委员会就是管理科学事业的方针、政策、计划和重大措施的机构，它负责统筹安排中国科学院、高等学校、中央各产业部门的科学研究机构和地方的科学研究机构四个方面的工作。十二年科学规划，是几百位中国科学家集体劳动的成果，科学规划委员会的委员大部分也是科学家，这怎么能说是不信任中国科学家的表现呢？如果“外行”不能领导“内行”的说法意味着只有本行才能领导本行，这不仅否定了政治对于科学的领导，而且实际上也否定了科学研究工作中的统一领导的任何可能，因为学术上的专业是分门别类的，而世界上同时精通各种科学专业的科学领导干部是不存在的。这种理论，对科学队伍只能起瓦解作用，是不利于科学事业的发展的。
    三、关于人民生活
    解放以后随着我国工农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，广大人民的生活也得到了显著的改善。首先，让我们来看占我们国家人口百分之八十以上的农民的生活状况。解放以来，我国的农业生产总值是逐年上升的。1949年全国农业生产总值是三百二十六亿元，1956年上升到五百八十三亿元，比1949年增长了百分之七十九。随着农业总产值的增长，农民的购买力也大大提高了。1950年全国农民的购买力是八十一亿元，1956年上升到一百九十一亿元，比1950年增长了百分之一百三十六。国家供应给农民的消费资料也随着增长了。1956年比1950年，棉布供应增加了两倍，胶鞋增加了一点九倍，食盐增加了将近一倍，糖增加了二点三倍，煤油增加了十一倍，香烟增加了一点四倍。在五万万多的农民中，生产和消费的增长这样大，是旧中国从来没有过的。我们再来分析一下占全国人口第二位的职工的生活状况。1949年末，国家机关、公私企业和事业共有职工大约八百万人，1956年末增加到二千四百万人，其中有私营企业转为国营和公私合营企业的人员和乡村干部共约三百万人。在七年中间，我们解决了约一千三百万人的就业问题，这是旧中国历史上从来没有过的。1952年全国职工年平均工资是每人四百四十六元，1956年提高到六百一十元。在四年中间，提高了将近百分之三十七。这样的工资增长速度，也是旧中国历史上从来没有过的。有的人对新中国人民生活的这种显著变化熟视无睹，说解放后人民生活水平下降了。工人和农民是人民的最大多数，他们的生活改善了，怎么能说人民的生活水平下降了呢？应该承认，有少数高级知识分子和少数职工，他们的生活虽然比解放以前的几年有了改善，但是还没有恢复到抗日战争以前的水平。但是，考虑到广大工农生活水平还比较低的情况，他们的生活水平也不能提高得太多太快。至于占人口极少数的旧社会的剥削者，他们的生活水平比解放以前降低了，这是完全应该的。在剥削阶级统治的社会里，少数剥削者过着挥霍无度的奢侈生活，而创造社会财富的广大劳动人民却处于贫困的半饥饿状态。只有社会主义的新中国，才能够为全体人民的利益着想，首先保证最大多数劳动人民的生活需要，同时也照顾到其他阶层的合理需要。那些说解放后人民生活水平下降了的人，如果他们不是把个别的局部的现象不加分析地当作普遍的全体的现象来下断语，那就是在他们心目中只想到极少数的剥削者而没有看到广大的劳动人民。
    我们是经济和文化落后的农业国，人口多，耕地少，底子穷，因此，人民生活水平比起工业发达的国家来说是很低的。解放以后，工农业生产的恢复和发展是快的，但是，按全国人口计算的平均产量，却增长得相当慢。生产的发展和社会财富的增长是改善人民生活的物质基础。人民生活改善的速度，决定于生产的发展速度，而其中消费资料生产的增长速度，在我国目前的条件下，又在相当大的程度上决定于农业的增长速度。我们是六万万人口的大国，如果每个人每年增加一元钱的购买力，全国人民的购买力就增加六亿元，国家也就必须相应地增加六亿元消费资料的供应。如果人们用来买吃的，就需要增加六十亿斤粮食的供应。如果人们用来买穿的，就需要增加两千万匹的棉布供应，也就是要增加两百万担棉花的生产。从1952年到1956年，我国消费资料的生产，平均每年大约增加三十多亿元。扣除小量的储备和每年人口增长所消费的部分，可以用于改善人民生活的，每人每年只有四元左右。这些数字表明每年人民生活的改善是有一定限度的。超过一定的限度，就会出现消费资料供应紧张、购买力和物资供应不平衡的现象，就会影响市场物价的稳定。因此，六万万人民生活的水平只能在本国生产发展的基础上逐步提高，不可能要求太快。有些人不从我国上述的实际情况出发，以为一进入社会主义，人民生活水平马上就能够有很大的提高，而不懂得必须经过长期的辛勤劳动和艰苦建设才能逐步提高人民生活的道理。过去我们对于这些道理向全国人民说明得不够，宣传得不够，这是有缺点的。但是另有一种人，他们天天埋怨中国人民生活水平太低，口口声声称道美国生活方式，他们是在幻想把中国拖回到半殖民地的老路上去，重新过那极少数剥削者的生活。
    有人说，现在工农的生活太悬殊了。这种说法是否合乎实际呢？应该承认，工农的生活是有差别的。但是，当我们把工农的生活加以比较的时候，必须考虑到工农生活不同的历史条件和城乡不同的生活条件。在旧中国的农村，广大的贫苦农民过着衣不蔽体、食不饱肚、糠菜半年粮的生活。解放后，经过土地改革和合作化运动，目前我国农民大体上有百分之二十到三十过着略有积余的生活；有百分之六十左右过着有吃有穿的生活；有百分之十到十五过着少吃少穿的生活，这一类人还需要国家和农业合作社的帮助。全国平均起来，每个农民一年的农业生产净收入，大约有七十元左右，合到每个农户一年的收入大约有三百元左右。这里所说的农业生产净收入，不仅包括农民从生产合作社分配到的收入，同时也包括农民个人经营的农业生产的收入。当然，全国各地农民的收入是不平衡的，贫瘠地区每个农民的收入比七十元的数目低，富庶地区每个农民的收入比七十元的数目高。1956年职工全年的平均工资是六百一十元，比农民一家人的全年平均收入高一倍多。如果只从收入的货币数字比较，似乎工农生活确是很悬殊。但是，如果将城乡不同的生活条件估计在内，情况就不同了。在农村维持有吃有穿的生活水平，从全国来看，大约每人每月的平均开支只需要五元，在城市维持同等的生活水平，却需要十元。因此，我们认为，工农生活水平虽然有差别，但是并不过分悬殊，而且工人的劳动生产率比农民高得多，因而在工农生活之间保持一个合理的差别，也是应该的。在过去几次工资改革中，我们对于壮工、杂工、学徒工和一部分临时工的工资标准规定高了一些，这是很大的缺点，应该改正。农民对这部分职工的工资过高表示不满意，也是有理由的，但是，这同那种故意夸大工农生活悬殊，借以挑拨工农关系、破坏工农联盟的恶意攻击，是没有丝毫相同之点的。今后对于这部分职工的工资标准，必须因地制宜地结合当地农民生活情况，分别加以规定，使他们的生活水平和当地农民的生活水平大体上保持平衡。我们还应该向工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，工业是不能孤立地发展的。工业的原料和工业产品的市场，职工生活消费资料的供应，很大部分依靠农业的增产和农民的支援。在广大农民生活水平还不能很快提高的情况下，工人对于生活的改善也不应该提出过高的要求。
    有人说，高级工作人员和低级工作人员的待遇也悬殊太大了。如果这个意见是指目前我们的国家还很穷，工农的生活水平还很低，因而高级工作人员和低级工作人员的待遇也不宜差别太大，那么，这个意见是对的。如果这个意见是指不同性质的劳动不应该在待遇上有一个合理的差别，那就不对了。在社会主义制度下，同社会生产力的水平相适应的分配原则是按劳取酬。在社会主义社会里，对于简单劳动和复杂劳动、体力劳动和脑力劳动，国家所付给他们的报酬还应该有一定的差别。取消这种差别，对于提高劳动生产率和提高业务、技术水平都是不利的。因此，我们既要反对悬殊太大，又要反对平均主义。在去年工资改革的时候和工资改革以后，为着适当地缩小高级工作人员和低级工作人员的工资差距，国家对于企业领导人员和国家机关高级工作人员的工资标准，曾经先后采取了控制或者降低的措施。今后对于高级工作人员在工资方面、在住房和医疗等方面以及供给制残余的不合理现象，将继续采取措施，逐步地加以调整和解决。至于有人故意夸大高级工作人员和低级工作人员待遇上的悬殊，甚至把领导人员说成是“剥削者”，如果他们不是极端幼稚无知的话，那便是别有用心了。
    下面我想对于劳动就业、工资制度、学徒制度、人民文化生活等几个问题讲一些意见。
　　关于劳动就业问题。
　　解放以来，经过逐年的努力，如前所说，全国职工增加了一千三百万人，旧社会遗留下来的失业人员已经基本上得到了安置。关于高级知识分子的招聘工作，去年进行了登记，今后将按照他们的学识专长和他们的生活情况，分年逐步地加以安排。解放以后，人民的生活安定了，社会的医药卫生工作加强了，社会救济和职工福利的事业发展了，因而人口的增殖率有很大的增长。但是，我们的工业还很落后，国家机关和工业企业的职工已经增加过多，今后每年只能根据生产和事业发展的需要，吸收必要的人员。因此，在很长的时期内，劳动就业的主要方向仍然是参加农业劳动。手工业和服务性行业也将是劳动就业的一个辅助方面。最近上海、江苏、广东等地方劳动部门因地制宜地积极帮助将近一万多失业人员参加了手工业、服务性行业和各种社会辅助劳动，这是一个好经验。今后还应该提倡由社会团体和群众自己想出各种办法，扩大就业范围，协助国家解决劳动就业问题。在社会福利事业方面，也应该发挥社会团体和广大群众的力量，提倡社会团体和群众之间的互助，举办各种社会福利事业。最近全国职工家属代表会议所介绍的各种群众性的互助互济办法，是有成效的，应该提倡和推广。关于工资制度问题。工资问题是一个极为复杂的生产和分配的问题。它体现着工人阶级内部、产业之间、地区之间、各类人员之间的关系，也体现着工农之间、积累和消费之间、集体利益和个人利益之间、眼前利益和长远利益之间的关系。这些方面的关系需要合理的安排，而旧的不平衡和旧的矛盾解决了，又会出现新的不平衡和新的矛盾，这就必须不断地加以调整和解决。
    解放初，我们国家的工资制度是十分混乱的。旧中国遗留下来的工资制度，是轻重倒置、高低悬殊、极不合理的，它反映了旧中国半殖民地经济的畸形发展，也反映了旧中国各派经济集团和统治集团之间的相互竞争。同时，许多老干部和工作人员还实行着老解放区的供给制度。工资制度上的这种混乱状态对于统一的国家机关和国营企业、事业是完全不相适应的。经过1950年、1952年、1956年几次的工资制度改革，我们已经初步地建立了大体上适合我国情况的工资制度。但是，它还很不完善。在工资等级制度、计件工资制度、学徒制度、津贴制度、奖励制度方面，在劳动保险、公费医疗、福利费等等职工福利待遇的规定方面，都还有不切合实际和不够合理的地方，需要我们继续加以改进。在工资改革工作中，也还存在着不少缺点。我们在学习社会主义国家先进的工资工作经验的时候，结合我们国家的实际情况不够，对待中国原有的工资制度中有用的经验，还缺乏慎重的研究，甚至采取简单的否定态度。这是应该引为教训的。
　　关于学徒制度问题。
　　对于解放前的学徒制度，它的封建性的陋规是应该否定的，但是，关于学徒学习的期限、学习的内容、学徒的待遇以及酬师制度等方面，有许多好的经验，我们却应该慎重地加以研究和吸取。现在所实行的短期技工训练班和短期培训学徒的办法，值得我们重新研究，并且加以改革。经验证明，短期培训出来的技术工人，大都技术知识很窄，缺乏多方面的独立的作业能力。同时，由于学徒期间待遇过高，学习期满后升级太快，升级考试制度不合理，因而容易造成青年工人忽视生产实践经验的倾向，甚至在一部分青年工人中间滋长着骄傲自满的情绪。他们把掌握生产技术知识看成是轻而易举的事情，不尊重老工人在长期生产实践中刻苦钻研得来的技术经验，不虚心向老工人请教学习，这种现象已经影响到新老工人之间的团结和师徒之间的合作关系。我们必须耐心地教育青年工人，使他们懂得，多方面的熟练的生产技术绝不是在几个月甚至几年中间能够学到的，必须在长期的生产实践中间，经过不断的勤学苦练才能够逐步地掌握。老工人是我们国家的宝贵财富，不仅他们的技术经验是丰富的宝贵的，而且他们的政治经验和生活经验也是丰富的。他们曾经长期在旧社会里过着被压迫和被剥削的生活，他们也亲身体验了新社会的平等的幸福的生活，因而他们最懂得应该怎样珍贵和保护革命的胜利成果。青年工人是我们社会主义建设的接班人，是未来的美好生活的创造者。但是，他们还年青，他们的政治经验和生活经验还很少，因此，向老工人学习，在生产实践中锻炼，是今后青年工人提高阶级觉悟和生产技术知识的主要方法。同样，在农民中，也应该教育青年农民尊重老农，虚心学习老农的生产经验和政治经验。在知识分子中，应该教育青年知识分子尊重老科学家、老教育家、老工程师、老医生、老作家、老艺术家，虚心地学习他们多少年来经过刻苦钻研所积累的学识和经验。
　　关于人民的文化生活问题。
　　我们国家的文化水平是落后的，文盲大约占人口的百分之七十以上。解放以后，我们就积极地推行扫盲和普及教育。在校的小学学生已经从1949年的二千四百多万人增加到1956年的六千三百多万人。从1949年到1956年，全国扫除文盲二千二百多万人。从1951年到1957年，国家用于普及教育的经费将近四十九亿元，占全部文教经费的百分之二十四强，占全部普通教育经费的百分之五十四强。这样的发展是相当迅速的。但是，仍然不能满足学龄儿童按时入学的要求。除了国家办学以外，我们应该积极提倡集体办学，个人办学，充分地发挥社会集团和群众的力量，以补充国家力量的不足。过去在扫盲工作上，有过忽起忽落的毛病，在小学和幼儿教育上，有过部分待遇过高的错误。这些，现在都在改进中。我国人民的文化生活也有了很大的改善，今后我们应该在“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针下更加充分地发挥文化艺术工作者和广大人民群众的创造性和积极性。国家只能集中地举办少数的示范性的文艺和体育事业，并且引导他们走向自给。对于大量的各种文化艺术事业，应该提倡文化艺术工作者自力经营。经验证明，过去完全由国家包下来的想法和办法是不妥当的。更重要的是在广大群众中广泛地开展业余的文艺和体育活动。国家举办、自力经营、群众业余这三个方面的文艺和体育活动队伍，应该通过实践相互学习和提高，以逐步地满足人民对于文化生活的需要。
    在改善人民的卫生保健状况和防治疾病方面，我们这几年也取得了不少成绩。我们的医药卫生队伍已经迅速扩大，城乡的环境卫生和个人卫生已经有了显著改善，几种对人民危害最大的疾病，例如鼠疫、霍乱、天花等，已经能够基本上加以控制。但是，卫生部门在领导群众性的卫生运动方面，还有时紧时松的毛病；在医疗制度方面，还有许多不合理和不便于群众的地方；在医药、卫生工作人员中间，还存在着不团结合作和彼此不尊重的现象，今后应该坚决克服上述这些缺点，坚决贯彻群众路线，彻底改善卫生医药工作，更好地发挥中医的力量，加强医药卫生人员的团结，以保证进一步提高人民的健康水平。
    社会主义革命和社会主义建设的目的是发展生产，改善人民生活，使社会主义社会中的一切劳动者都能够共同享受富裕的有文化的幸福生活。这是多少年来我国劳动人民所向往的伟大理想。但是，我们的国家还很穷，我们的文化还落后，我们的困难还很多，我们的经验还不够，要使我们国家从根本上摆脱贫困和落后的状态，把我国建设成为一个具有现代化工业和现代化农业的社会主义国家，使我国的人民能够享受幸福美好的生活，这是一场长期的艰巨斗争。取得这场斗争的胜利，不是几年而是需要几十年的时间。我们必须自上而下地提倡勤俭朴素作风，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的革命优良传统。我们的老一代人，要教育年青的一代，使他们懂得美好的生活是必须用自己的辛勤劳动去创造的。
    四、关于国家基本制度
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。在我们的国家里，一切权力属于人民，全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会是人民行使权力的机关。在这些机关和其他国家机关里实行民主集中制。这些就是宪法规定的我们国家的基本制度。我们的国家制度是我国社会主义经济关系的上层建筑。正是因为有了这种国家制度，才保证了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，今后还必须依靠这种国家制度，才能保证在我国建成社会主义社会。因此，对我们国家基本制度的任何动摇都是不能容许的。
    当然，这并不是说，我们国家制度的一切方面都已经是尽善尽美，而不需要任何改进和发展了。恰恰相反，这种改进和发展是经常需要的。社会主义的社会制度在我国还只是初步建立起来，各种旧的生产关系的残余不能不在我们国家的某些制度中有所反映。毫无疑问，这些旧生产关系的残余是一定要一天天消亡下去，而社会主义生产关系是一定要一天天更加巩固、更加发展起来。因此，我们国家基本制度的某些组织形式和运用方法，必须随着经济的发展和政治情况的变化而不断改进。同时，我们建设社会主义的时间还很短，我们的经验还很不够，只有在建设社会主义的实践中，逐步积累经验，才能使我们国家基本制度本身更加健全和完善起来。
    至于根据我们国家的基本制度所制定的有关政治、经济、文化等等方面的各种制度和组织形式，更是必须随着情况的变化而不断改进的。例如，在中央和地方的关系上，在解放初期为了工作的便利，建立了大区军政委员会或者行政委员会。到了1954年，为了适应在计划经济下加强统一管理的需要，我们撤销了大区军政委员会。近两年来，为了纠正中央在某些方面集中过多、统得过严的缺点，我们又研究了体制问题，现在政府正准备适当地扩大地方权力，以便在中央的集中领导下，充分发挥地方的积极性创造性，推进社会主义建设事业。所有这些改变，显然是必需的，正确的。这个例子可以说明我们各方面的制度和组织形式必须随着客观情况而不断改进，否则，就不能同经济基础相适应，不能为经济基础服务，甚至起阻碍经济发展的作用。
    就目前而言，我们各方面的制度的确有许多还是不够完备的，有缺点的。造成这种现象的原因，一方面是由于有些制度在制订的当时是合理的，正确的，但是，当情况发生变化之后没有及时地加以改变；另一方面是由于有些制度在制订的时候，就缺乏深入的调查研究，因而不完全符合于客观情况，甚至是错误的。还有一些制度上的缺点，是由于学习社会主义国家先进经验的时候，没有很好地结合我国的具体情况所造成的。在现行的各种制度中，凡是有缺点和错误的，国务院有关部门都应该吸收各方面提出的有益的意见，分别加以修正、补充或者废除。
    我在这里要说一说许多人表示关心的法制问题。我国今天的法制，的确还没有完备，但是也并不像有些人所说的“完全无法可循”。中华人民共和国成立以来，我们在颁布宪法前后，已经制订了许多重要的法律，如工会法、劳动保险条例、土地改革法、农业合作社示范章程、民族区域自治实施纲要、选举法、婚姻法、兵役法、惩治反革命条例、惩治贪污条例、逮捕拘留条例等等。同时政府根据工作需要，还制订了许多单行条例和规章，发布了许多决定和指示，这些在实际上都起了法律的作用。在国家建立之初，特别是在过渡时期，政治经济情况变动很快，在各方面都制订带有根本性的、长期适用的法律是有困难的。例如民法、刑法，在生产资料私人所有制的社会主义改造没有基本完成，社会主义所有制没有完全确立以前，是难以制订的。在这种情况下，国家颁布暂行条例、决定、指示等等来作为共同遵守的工作规范，是必要的，适当的。只有在这些条例、决定、指示行之有效的基础上，才可以总结经验，制订长期适用的法律。就是资本主义国家的法律，在初期也是不完备的，也是经过很长时期才逐渐制订出来的。现在生产资料私有制的社会主义改造已经基本完成，社会主义所有制已经确立，国家在各方面工作的实践中也取得了一定经验，这就使我们有可能在总结过去经验的基础上，在整理过去已有法规的同时，制订社会主义的各种法律，例如刑法已经有了初步草案，民法和治安管理处罚条例也在由有关方面草拟中。
    现在有些右派分子借口帮助共产党整风，发出了许多破坏性的言论，其中有不少是直接向我们国家的基本制度进攻的。他们从资产阶级民主的观点出发来攻击我们的国家制度；他们诬蔑人民民主专政制度是一切错误和缺点的根源；他们企图用否定成绩、夸大缺点的办法来诋毁我们的国家制度。他们企图在我们最高国家权力机关——全国人民代表大会以外，另外成立某种国家权力机关，例如所谓“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”之类，他们的目的不外是想使我们的国家政权离开工人阶级和它的先锋队——共产党的领导。他们把这些破坏性的言论加上各种伪装，企图迷惑那些还看不清楚他们面目的人。这种反对社会主义的言论当然不能同善意的批评相提并论。批评缺点和错误是为了健全和发展我们的社会主义制度，这是我们所欢迎的。而右派分子实质上是要把我们的国家从社会主义的道路拖到资本主义的道路上去。这是广大人民所决不容许的。
    我们的国家有民主和专政两方面的职能。有人认为，在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，专政这方面的任务就已经没有了。这种看法是错误的。这是因为在我们国内还有一些残余的反革命分子，他们仍然在伺机而动。在原来的剥削阶级分子中，也还有进行破坏社会主义建设活动的人。此外，在社会上还有一些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人犯、放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子。尤其不要忘记美帝国主义和蒋介石集团还经常对我们进行武装挑衅，并且不断派遣特务、间谍来进行破坏活动和颠复活动。因此，我们决不能削弱我们国家的专政的职能，我们必须改进专政机构的工作，继续巩固国防，保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的社会主义事业。
    根据我国的宪法，我国公民享有广泛的民主自由权利。随着我国社会主义事业的发展，这种权利日益扩大并且日益得到更充分的保障。在资本主义国家里，只有少数剥削阶级分子才能享受自由，而广大劳动人民，是没有真正的自由可言的。与此相反，我们社会主义国家保证了广大人民行使宪法上所给予的自由权利，而对于那些少数反革命分子，必须剥夺他们的自由权利。右派分子说，在我们的国家里，自由权利太少了，好像是对于反对宪法中所规定的国家基本制度、反对社会主义的一切言论和行动，国家都要给予便利和保证，才叫做有了自由。显然，人民是不会同意给予这种自由的。
    右派分子还攻击我们的选举制度。他们认为，只有像资本主义国家的选举才是最民主的。其实，有些资本主义国家虽然实行了所谓普遍、直接的选举，但是资产阶级统治者总是用各种方法特别是金钱和行政手段控制选举，来保障他们的统治地位。在我们这里，恰恰相反，选举制度首先是要保障工人、农民和其他劳动人民的民主权利，同时又照顾在全国人口中占极少数的资产阶级分子和其他爱国人士，使他们在国家权力机关中也有一定比例的代表。目前我国在基层实行直接选举，在县以上实行间接选举。这种选举制度是适合于我国当前情况的较好的民主形式。但是，这并不排除在条件成熟的时候逐步地在县以上的各级也实行直接选举。在进行选举的时候，由中国共产党和各民主党派、各人民团体协商提出联合的候选人名单，事实证明这是适当的。至于候选人的名额问题，过去在联合提出的候选人名单中，候选人数和当选名额相等，这是各方面协商的结果。今后在这个问题上的具体作法，也仍然要经由各方面协商决定。总之，我们国家的选举制度是为了真正保障最广大人民的民主权利，并且在社会主义基础上把一切可以团结的力量团结起来，而不是用虚伪的形式欺骗人民，保护少数人的利益。
    选举是人民享有民主权利的一个方面，我们国家的民主生活还有更丰富内容。宪法中规定：“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。”我们国家机关就是根据这种群众路线的方法来进行工作的。许多重要的法律，在制订过程中，都经过群众的充分酝酿和讨论；国家的经济计划，也由国家有关部门提出控制指标或者草案交给基层生产单位的广大群众讨论，然后加以确定；为了发动广大职工积极参加企业管理和对企业行政领导工作进行监督，我们在企业中正在推行职工代表大会制度；在农业生产合作社里，也根据民主办社的原则，建立了社员代表大会和社务委员会。我国公民，经常通过人民代表、监察机关、人民团体、报纸刊物对政府各方面的工作提出批评和建议，也常常直接用来信来访的形式向各级领导机关申述意见。我们的国家机关，正是通过这些办法，经常听取群众的意见来改进自己的工作。政府领导机关对待人民批评、建议、来访和来信的工作还做得不很好，我们应该迅速加以纠正，并且要求各级政府机关十分重视这种工作。正在进行着的整风运动，也是我国民主生活的一个显著的表现。发动群众来公开揭发和批评我们的国家机关和工作干部的缺点和错误以便加以克服，这是任何号称自由民主的资本主义国家所不会做，而且也不敢做的事情。
    但是应该指出，在我们国家各级行政管理机关中还存在着，甚至是严重地存在着官僚主义的习气。社会主义制度在我国还只是初步建立起来，旧社会的影响，特别是资产阶级的思想，还经常在侵蚀我们国家机关的工作干部；人民的文化水平还不高，因而他们行使参加国家事务的管理和监督的权利，还不免受到一定的限制。所以在我们的国家机关中，官僚主义就有可能滋长起来。同时，我们国家的管理制度上的某些缺点，例如机构庞大，层次过多，有些事权过于集中等等，也助长了官僚主义。官僚主义习气的存在，妨碍着我们的国家机关同人民的联系，给工作带来了很大损失。我们必须继续扩大民主，依靠群众的监督，不断地进行反对官僚主义的斗争。
    我们国家机关实行民主集中制，就是要把广泛的民主和高度的集中互相结合起来。我们不是为民主而民主，我们之所以要有广泛的民主，是为了团结一切力量来共同建设社会主义，发展社会生产力。如果只有民主，没有集中，就不可能使全国人民在一个共同的方向、统一的计划下进行有组织的共同斗争，也就不可能达到建成社会主义社会的伟大目的。民主集中制的具体运用，是要根据客观情况的变动而有所不同的。大家知道，过去在进行革命战争的时期，在进行社会主义革命的时期，我们对于民主和集中这两方面比较着重于集中，但是，即使在战争和革命的时期，集中仍然是建立在广泛民主的基础上的，因为不如此，就不能适应战争的需要，不能保证社会主义革命的胜利。到了社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，我们就有可能进一步扩大民主。近两年来，在中央和地方的关系上，在经济管理工作上，民主的扩大都是很明显的。但是在任何情况下，决不能因为民主的扩大而根本否定集中的领导。小资产阶级从他们自发的无政府主义倾向出发，常常向往于所谓“绝对民主”，也就是不要集中领导的民主。这种“绝对民主”只能使人民陷入散漫的、无组织的状况中，不能用集体的力量来保障人民的利益。所以，反对社会主义的右派分子特别喜欢这种“绝对民主”的观念，企图利用这种观念来涣散劳动人民的意志，瓦解劳动人民的组织性和战斗性。为了击败右派分子的阴谋，我们必须坚决地保卫我们的民主集中制度，不让那些所谓“绝对民主”的观念来侵蚀我们的队伍。
    中国共产党在国家政治生活中的领导地位是宪法明文肯定了的。共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，共产党的领导，就是体现工人阶级的领导。中国人民在共产党领导下，已经取得了民主革命和社会主义革命两次伟大胜利。在建设社会主义的事业中，同样必须有共产党的领导，因为建设社会主义，就是要用工人阶级的世界观来改造社会。共产党坚定不移的方针就是要领导全中国人民建成没有剥削、没有阶级的繁荣幸福的共产主义社会，也就是中国人民历来所憧憬的大同世界。难道除了共产党以外，还有别的党派能够领导中国人民实现这样伟大的理想吗？有些右派分子把共产党对国家政治生活中的领导地位说成是什么“党天下”，这完全是恶意的诽谤。事实上，正是在共产党领导下，中国广大人民才真正成为国家的主人，才能够充分发挥自己的力量来建设新的生活。　　北京工人说“共产党领导的中国就是工人阶级的天下，就是人民的天下”。这是对于这种“党天下”的叫嚣的最好的回答。所谓“党天下”的说法，也就是把共产党当成一个脱离群众与群众对立的宗派，所以有些右派分子又说，共产党就是宗派主义的根子，这是完全违反事实的谰言。事实上，中国共产党从来都是反对宗派主义的，在民主革命和社会主义革命过程中，共产党都坚持团结一切可以团结的力量，因而才形成了全国人民的革命大团结。在社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，中国共产党又主动地提出了愿意同各民主党派长期共存互相监督的方针。而它的最终目的又是要实现消灭一切阶级、从而使一切政党，包括共产党在内，都趋于消亡的共产主义社会。这样的党同宗派主义是绝不相容的。共产党总是教育党员要时时刻刻注意加强党和群众的联系，绝不容许党员用宗派主义的态度来对待党外人士。中国人民大众之所以信任共产党的领导，也就是因为他们根据事实看清楚了中国共产党是一个真正全心全意为人民服务的工人阶级政党。
    在建设社会主义社会的事业中，工农联盟是基本力量，但是同时必须团结其他一切拥护社会主义和愿意接受社会主义改造的阶级、阶层。共产党领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线就是全国人民革命大团结的具体表现。有了这样的统一战线，就能够更好地联系和团结广大人民群众，反映各方面人民群众的意见和要求，使国家能够及时地采取适当措施来调节他们的利益，正确处理人民内部的矛盾。同时，通过团结在这样的统一战线之内的各民主党派、各人民团体，就能够更好地进行社会主义思想教育和社会主义改造工作，推进社会主义建设事业的发展。共产党提出的同各民主党派长期共存互相监督的方针的作用和目的就在这里。广大人民所希望于各民主党派的就是坚定地站在社会主义立场上，注意进行思想改造，以充分发挥他们在国家生活中的积极作用。随着社会主义建设的发展，人民民主统一战线必然还要进一步地巩固和发展。任何怀疑统一战线政策的意义，低估统一战线的作用，轻视统一战线工作的思想都是错误的。
    但是，必须肯定，共产党是统一战线的领导力量和核心力量，社会主义是统一战线的政治基础，也就是全国人民团结奋斗的共同目标。这些不可动摇的原则，是参加人民民主统一战线的各民主党派所必须遵循的轨道，离开这个轨道，就是自外于统一战线。
    我们国家的权力机关，是在共产党领导下由各民族、各阶级、各党派、各人民团体的代表人物组成的。国家的大政方针都是由各方面通过各种形式事先协商然后提交有关国家机关讨论和制定的，而在执行这些方针的机关中，又有各民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表人物参加。这种在共产党领导下各民主党派和无党派民主人士共同参与国家管理工作的办法，能够更好地团结全国人民，调动一切积极因素来建设社会主义。这正是表现了我国国家制度的优越性。资本主义国家所标榜的两党或者多党轮流执政的办法，只是资产阶级各派集团欺骗劳动人民的虚假民主罢了。现在有些右派分子所梦想的，就是要把这种资产阶级的多党政治和“各党派轮流执政”的办法，搬到中国来代替我们的人民民主制度。
    1954年我受第一届全国人民代表大会的委托组织政府的时候，就是根据宪法规定的以共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线的原则提出国务院组成人员名单的，当时共产党以外的各民主党派和无党派民主人士参加政府的成员约占四分之一以上，后来增加政府成员的时候，大致也是根据了这个比例。这种安排是根据当时情况确定的，现在看来也是适当的。
    要保证政府各方面政策的正确执行，就必须在机关、学校、企业和团体中都有共产党的坚强的核心领导。共产党必须领导一切的原则主要是从政治上来说的，并不等于一切具体工作都要由共产党直接管理；相反的，许多专门业务工作应该由专家负责。这里所说的专家，自然也包括共产党员专家在内。至于体现共产党领导的具体组织形式和工作方法，可以而且应该因时因事有所不同，以求更好地发挥党的领导作用，使领导和被领导、共产党员和非共产党人士都能够充分发挥积极性，更好地合作共事。许多人在这方面提出的善意的批评和建议是应该仔细研究的。但是，右派分子提出的“中共组织退出机关、学校”、“共产党不在知识分子中发展组织”、“党不要在政权之外再搞一套党的系统”、“请共产党下台”等等狂妄要求，却与前面说过的“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”、“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“党天下”、“各党派轮流执政”等等谬论同出一辙，互相呼应，目的都是要使人民政权脱离工人阶级政党的领导，以便按照他们的资产阶级面貌来改变我们国家的性质。
    有些人批评现在有党政不分的现象。对这个问题要加以分析。党对于人民群众直接发出政治上的号召和政策性的决定，对于政府工作不但没有妨碍，而且有很大的帮助。有些带有政治号召和政策指示性质的决定或者带有群众运动性质、需要党政一齐动手的工作指示，由同级党政机关联合发布；有些工作的检查，由相应的党政机关联合进行；有些政府机关的会议邀请共产党和其他民主党派的有关负责人参加；事实证明，这些办法对于推进工作是有好处的，今后还应该继续采用。但是，在某些机关中，共产党的组织包办代替行政工作，或者对于某些具体业务不通过行政而直接干预，这些现象对于政府工作和对于党的工作都是不适当的，应该加以纠正。
    有人提出在国家机关、学校、企业中非共产党员的负责人有职无权的问题，这是有一定事实根据的。但是，如果对这个问题加以具体分析，便可以看出存在有各种不同情况。一种情况是共产党员和非共产党人士合作得很好，彼此之间无墙无沟；另一种情况是有些共产党的组织和党员干部对非共产党人士的职权不够尊重，甚至对他们采取歧视、排斥的态度，这是严重的宗派主义性质的错误；第三种情况，是有些非共产党人士，对自己的职务尽责不够，并且对共产党的组织和党员采取疏远和猜疑的态度，而有关的共产党的组织和共产党的负责干部对他们的接近和帮助也往往不够。后两种情况应该引起我们严重注意，积极加以克服。解决这个问题的关键，首先在于共产党的组织要教育自己的党员，切实执行党的统一战线政策，克服宗派主义思想，善于在工作中尊重、团结和帮助党外人士，虚心倾听他们的意见和批评，学习他们的专长和经验，不断地提高自己，改进工作。对于某些影响团结、增加隔阂的工作制度，应该加以改变。同时，非共产党人士也应该勇于尽职尽责，消除对于工农干部的抵触情绪，消除对于共产党员的猜疑隔阂，开诚相见，对于工作中的缺点随时提出批评和建议，并且加强学习，提高自己的思想和认识，以期达到双方亲密合作、和衷共济的目的。在非共产党人士中有一些人对于社会主义还抱着对立的情绪，他们尤其需要努力改造自己，清除这种对立情绪。
    中国共产党正在进行着的整风运动，同时也就是在我们的国家机关中的一次整风运动。这次整风运动的目的是为了有效地克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。对于这些错误的思想和作风的任何积极的批评，那怕态度有些偏激，内容不够全面，所根据的个别事实还有出入，我们都应该抱着欢迎的态度加以考虑，采纳其中有益的意见，来改进我们的工作。有些右派分子硬说，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的根源就是无产阶级专政，或者在指责我们的国家机关中的毛病和缺点的时候，把我们的国家机关和剥削阶级的国家机关相提并论，这些谬论必须加以驳斥。在资产阶级专政的国家里，国家机关是资产阶级压迫和剥削广大人民的工具。这种国家机关是同广大人民的利益根本对立的。在这种国家机关中，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义不仅是不可避免，而且是不可克服的。我们的国家机关完全是另一回事。社会主义是以工人阶级为领导的全体人民的共同事业，社会主义国家必须而且能够吸引最广大的人民群众来参加国家事务的管理和监督。所以社会主义国家从根本上说来，是同官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义不相容的。我们一定要、也一定能够战胜这一切病菌，我们国家的基本制度本身所具有的生命力，就是我们能够战胜这一切病菌的保证。
    五、关于国内外团结
    各位代表，我们大家都可以看到，我国人民已经在很短的时间内取得了很大的成就。我们的社会主义革命已经取得了基本胜利；大规模的社会主义建设正在稳步前进；人民生活水平正在逐步地提高；适应于我国社会主义经济基础的国家基本制度已经建立起来，这种国家制度正在对我国的社会主义事业起着巩固和推动的作用。我们究竟是依靠了什么力量，才能够不断地从胜利走向胜利呢？就国内来说，我们是依靠了各族人民在共产党领导下的大团结。就国外来说，我们是依靠了我国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，依靠了我国同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结。现在，摆在我们面前的是比过去更艰巨、更伟大的任务。为了胜利地完成这些任务，我们应该进一步加强全国人民在社会主义基础上的大团结，批判一切反对社会主义的思想，继续肃清公开的和暗藏的残余反革命分子；在国外，我们应该进一步加强社会主义阵营的大团结和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的大团结，孤立帝国主义侵略集团，争取世界持久和平和不同社会制度各国的和平共处。
    谈到全国人民大团结的问题，首先应该说明人民的界限。在现阶段，人民是指拥护社会主义和参加社会主义建设的各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和各方面的爱国人士，也就是说按照宪法享有公民权的一切人。同社会主义对抗、同人民对立的敌人是反革命分子，反动的势力和集团，和目前还在受着管制和劳动改造的分子。经过了社会主义革命的基本胜利，敌我之间的矛盾虽然还存在，但是国内的敌人却大大减少了，这就使得人民内部的矛盾突出起来。正是因为这样，1957年2月27日毛泽东主席在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上的报告中，特别指示我们要善于分辨敌我之间的和人民内部的两类性质不同的矛盾，并且提出了正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针和办法。但是，敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾并不是没有互相转化的可能的。目前还在管制中的分子，经过劳动改造重新做人以后，可以取得公民权，成为人民的一部分。而目前属于人民内部的一些人或者某种集团，如果他们坚持反对社会主义的立场，抗拒社会主义改造，破坏社会主义建设，他们就有可能从人民方面转化到人民的敌人方面去。
    处在目前中国社会大变革的时代，在人民内部，一部分人对于新的社会主义制度会暂时感到不习惯，另外一部分人甚至会感到严重的抵触。在社会向前发展的过程中，人们在思想和立场上常常表现出进步、中间和落后的不同状态，常常有左派、中间派和右派的分化。这是由社会发展的客观规律和人们思想发展的客观规律所决定的，而不是人为地划分出来的。工人阶级要用自己的世界观来改造社会，这也就包含着改造其他阶级分子的立场和思想，使他们能够适应于社会发展的要求。
    资产阶级右派分子虽然置身于人民的队伍之中，但是却站在反对社会主义的立场上，甚至采取不利于社会主义事业的行动。因此，我们必须在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，对这种人进行必要的坚决的斗争，使绝大多数真正爱国的人认识到右派分子的立场和行为的错误。右派分子一旦处于完全孤立的地位，他们本身就会发生变化。我们希望，经过外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够憣然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的。但是，也可能有极少数右派分子坚持反动立场，抗拒改造，甚至采取破坏社会主义建设的行动，那么，他们就将自绝于人民。
    全国人民在社会主义基础上的巩固团结是一个长期的奋斗目标，我们要不断地通过两方面的斗争来达到这个目标。一方面要正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，严肃认真地克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的思想和作风；另一方面要彻底批判右派分子反对社会主义、反对我们国家基本制度、反对共产党领导和破坏国内外团结的言论，使得在这些最根本问题上的是非更加明确起来。我们相信，全国绝大多数的人民是真正爱国的，是愿意站在社会主义方面的。共产党所进行的整风，政府对本身工作的检查，都会使人民内部的矛盾得到不断的解决，使工作中的错误得到纠正。那些企图利用我们人民内部矛盾和共产党进行整风的机会，在我们人民内部挑拨是非、企图破坏我们社会主义事业的阴谋是不能得逞的。相反地，这个阴谋的揭露，一定会教育全国人民更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围。
    有了国内的团结，我们就更有力量巩固我们和整个社会主义阵营的团结，巩固我们和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结。
    一年来，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团的扩军备战政策经常威胁着世界的和平。但是，不断壮大的和平力量终于推动着国际形势在总的方面朝着有利于全世界人民争取持久和平、反对战争的方向发展。
    帝国主义侵略集团曾经企图在匈牙利打开缺口，然后对其他社会主义国家进行各个击破。但是，匈牙利人民击退了帝国主义者的进攻，社会主义阵营各国也从匈牙利事件中吸取了深刻有益的教训。结果，整个社会主义阵营的团结不是削弱而是加强了。不久以前，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志和捷、波两国总理对我国的访问和最近一个时期以来社会主义各国领导人员之间一系列的互相访问，都对巩固社会主义阵营的团结，起了重要的作用。事实证明，建立在无产阶级国际主义的和民族平等的原则基础上的社会主义国际团结，是任何挑拨离间所不能破坏的。
    一年来，苏联对于重大国际问题所提出的一系列合理建议，例如关于裁军、禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器、停止试验核武器、取消在外国的军事基地和撤走在外国的武装部队、举行大国首脑会议等等建议，也推动了国际局势走向和缓。为了维护中近东的和平，苏联还提出了各大国保证中近东国家的主权和独立、不干涉它们内政的建议。苏联的这些建议，也是社会主义阵营各国的共同主张。这充分证明，我们社会主义国家决不会侵犯别人，也决不容许任何国家侵犯我们，我们坚决主张世界各国和平共处。
    英勇的埃及人民击退英法侵略、维护苏伊士运河主权的伟大胜利，标志着反殖民主义斗争的新的高涨。这一斗争同时也是维护世界和平的斗争。一年来，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、埃及、叙利亚等亚非民族主义国家在维护世界和平的事业中起着越来越重要的作用。日本人民反对美国军事占领、争取独立自由和维护世界和平的斗争，也有了很大的发展。所有这一些，都是促使国际形势趋向和缓的重要因素。但是，美国却利用英法被削弱的形势，竭力夺取英法在中近东、北非和世界其他地区的殖民地和势力范围，加强对当地人民的奴役和压迫。这是美国的新殖民主义政策。由于这个政策带有更大的欺骗性，由于某些国家的人民还缺乏斗争的经验，美国殖民主义者的阴谋在某些国家，例如在约旦，一时得逞，使这些国家人民的民族独立斗争遭到暂时的挫折，是完全可能的。但是，争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的运动，正像任何人民运动一样，是不可能镇压下去的。美国越来越露骨的干涉和越来越残酷的奴役和压迫，一定会使这些国家的人民更加觉醒，更加清楚地认识美国殖民主义的真面目。在差不多所有被美国控制的国家里，要求摆脱美国控制、采取和平中立政策、反对侵略性军事集团的呼声日益高涨，就证明了这一点。争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争是一个长期的、复杂的、反复的、但是一定要胜利的斗争。每一次挫折和每一个困难都会教育各国人民，提高他们的觉悟，使他们能够终于找到把斗争引向胜利的正确道路。
    特别值得注意的是，甚至在美国侵略者严密控制下的中国领土台湾，也发生了大规模的人民反美运动，而这次反美运动又正是发生在美国在台湾建立了导弹基地以后。现在美国又片面地宣布废除朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项，准备把新式武器运进南朝鲜。美国这样作，一方面是为了继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，威胁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，加剧远东的紧张局势，另一方面也是为了镇压南朝鲜人民，加强在南朝鲜的殖民统治。这就说明，美国正在步老殖民主义的后尘，不得不日益依靠刺刀来维持它的新殖民主义。可以肯定，美国的新殖民主义绝不会比老殖民主义有更好的下场。中国政府完全同意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出的召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议的建议，强烈谴责美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的片面行动。
    美国夺取它的同盟国家的殖民利益和侵犯这些国家的主权，引起了这些国家对美国日益明显的离心倾向。在美国的主要同盟国家中，争取摆脱美国的经济的和政治的控制，愿意同社会主义国家达成和解、进行互利的来往的趋势正在一天天发展。同时，包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民，展开了规模日益宏大的和平运动，这就充分表示美国侵略集团的扩军备战政策越来越不得人心。
    战争的危险依然存在。我们在任何时候都不能放松对美国侵略集团的警惕。但是，由于社会主义阵营的壮大和团结，由于爱好和平的国家和人民的队伍日益扩大，由于美国人民要求和平的呼声的增长和美国侵略集团处于日益孤立的地位，如果我们能够团结国际上一切可以团结的力量，坚持斗争，我们就有可能推动国际局势继续走向和缓，并且迫使帝国主义战争集团接受和平共处的原则。
    各位代表，我们建设社会主义的国际条件是有利的。我国人民根据毛泽东主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的光辉指示，正在通过反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的整风运动，通过揭露和批判反社会主义的右派的胜利斗争，达到更巩固的团结。只要我们继续努力，加强国内外团结，贯彻执行增产节约、勤俭建国的方针，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡我们伟大的社会主义事业胜利前进。
