Combined reports from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reported that Syrian President Kuwatli convened an emergency cabinet meeting on June 23. According to Western news agencies, the meeting discussed the recent tensions in relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia.

Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Asali told reporters, "Contacts are being made with Saudi Arabian officials to clear away the shadows existing in our bilateral relations. We hope that after these contacts, we can restore the unity of Arab countries in the face of the dangers around us."

Foreign Minister Bitar requested that the press no longer criticize Saudi Arabian King Saud.

Syrian newspapers recently criticized the talks held between Saud, King Faisal of Iraq, and King Hussein of Jordan. Western news agencies took the opportunity to exaggerate and sow discord between the two countries. The Associated Press reported on June 24 that Saudi Arabia had threatened to sever relations with Syria unless Syrian newspapers stopped criticizing Saud.

According to a Cairo dispatch: The Syrian "People's News" published a front-page message on June 22 stating: "The United States is conspiring to overthrow the current Syrian government and attempting to assassinate a number of Syrian leaders." This conspiracy is being orchestrated by U.S. diplomatic personnel stationed in Syria.

The newspaper said that the United States had spent millions of dollars and secretly infiltrated weapons and special agents into Syria. This action is being carried out with the cooperation of the Lebanese authorities. The military attachés of the U.S. Embassy in Syria and the Embassy in Lebanon have been in contact to coordinate the operation.

The newspaper revealed that some pro-American Arab embassies in Damascus have stepped up their activities to cooperate with the U.S. plan to help reactionary groups seize power in Syria. They are trying to infiltrate the grassroots organizations of the Syrian army and spread dissatisfaction among officers, spreading rumors of the deteriorating Syrian economic situation in order to create panic and chaos in Syria.

　　叙利亚总统召开内阁紧急会议
    力谋同沙特阿拉伯恢复团结
    美国在叙策划颠复和暗杀活动
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：叙利亚总统库阿特利在6月23日召集了内阁紧急会议。据西方通讯社报道，这个会议讨论了最近叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯的关系紧张问题。
    会后不久，总理阿萨利对新闻记者说，“正在同沙特阿拉伯官员们进行接触，来扫清存在于我们两国关系上的阴影。我们希望在这些接触之后，能在我们四周的危险面前恢复阿拉伯各国的团结”。
    外交部长比塔尔要求报界不要再抨击沙特阿拉伯国王沙特。
    叙利亚报纸最近曾经就沙特先后同伊拉克国王费萨尔和约旦国王侯赛因举行的会谈提出指责。西方通讯社趁机加以渲染，挑拨两国之间的关系。美联社6月24日说，沙特已经扬言要断绝同叙利亚的关系，除非叙利亚报纸停止抨击沙特。
    另据开罗消息：叙利亚“人民报”6月22日在头版发表消息说：“美国正在阴谋推翻叙利亚现政府，并且企图暗杀一批叙利亚领袖。”这一阴谋是由美国驻叙利亚的外交人员策划的。
    这家报纸说，美国花了几百万美元，并且偷偷地把武器和特务渗入叙利亚。这一行动得到黎巴嫩当局的合作。美国驻叙利亚大使馆和驻黎巴嫩大使馆的武官为了配合行动，一直在进行接触。
    这家报纸揭露，大马士革的某些亲美的阿拉伯国家大使馆已经加强了活动，配合美国计划帮助反动团体来夺取叙利亚政权。他们设法打进叙利亚军队的基层组织，并且在军官中间散布不满情绪，传播叙利亚经济情况恶化的谣言，以便在叙利亚制造恐慌和混乱。
