   Chen Mingshu's Speech Lacked Objectivity
   To the Editor:
    The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently invited leading figures from various democratic parties to hold a series of symposiums. Our newspapers have published all the speeches from these symposiums, from which every one of us, including those from the democratic parties, can appreciate the great democratic spirit of the Party Central Committee.
    Some of the opinions expressed by the democratic figures at the symposiums are, of course, good; but some are incorrect. I believe that the speech made by Mr. Chen Mingshu, one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, lacked objectivity and showed signs of negating everything. For example, he suggested that the Party should abolish the Party committee system in schools; and in his view, the joint issuance of instructions by the Party Central Committee and the State Council was inappropriate. I myself am a non-Party member of the masses, but my views differ in principle from those of Mr. Chen Mingshu.
    When observing these issues, I feel that we must first start from the most basic fact, which is that the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have led the Chinese people from one victory to another; the Party's selfless spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly has won the enthusiastic support of every unbiased Chinese person; workers, peasants, and handicraft laborers, as well as some people who originally belonged to various beliefs, are proud to have the leadership of the Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao; the people, especially the basic masses, love the Party and love their great leader Chairman Mao, which is a conclusion drawn from their own personal experience. Therefore, based on this alone, it is enough to illustrate the absolute necessity of the Party's leadership in all aspects.
    I believe that the system of combining collective leadership of the Party with individual responsibility is a good system. Since the implementation of this system in enterprises, bureaucracy has been greatly reduced; leading cadres can follow the mass line; and the enthusiasm of employees has been widely mobilized. If enterprises can do this, why should schools be special? I believe that the Party's leadership should be seen as the nerve center of a person. The Party should lead all aspects of work, otherwise it will lose its way. We, the people, all understand this, and recognizing and supporting the Party's leadership is the will of the people across the country. If the Party committee system is abolished in schools, it would be a huge mistake. Truly patriotic people cannot agree to this. As for the statement that the Party Central Committee and the State Council should not jointly issue instructions, this is unconvincing. To be honest, due to the Party's and Chairman Mao's infinite prestige among the people, when the working people see the Party Central Committee's instructions in the newspapers, such as the recent instructions on rectification and participation in physical labor, it gives us, the people, tremendous strength. I think if the democratic figures go deep into the workers and peasants to understand, these democratic figures will understand more deeply, which shows that learning from workers and peasants and participating in some physical labor is completely necessary.
    Regarding the issue of the Party's leadership and the extension of the fixed interest period, I suggest that the People's Daily reflect to the relevant departments and organize discussions among the people to listen to the opinions of the broad masses of workers and peasants, because the opinions of these upper-level people alone cannot represent the interests of the broad working people.
    Editor, I hope you will publish my letter as soon as possible.

### 陈铭枢的发言不够客观

专栏：读者来信

   陈铭枢的发言不够客观编辑同志：
    中共中央统战部最近连续邀请各民主党派领导人员进行座谈。座谈会的所有发言，我们的报纸都登载了，从这里，我们每一个人，包括民主人士在内，都会体会到党中央的伟大的民主精神。
    各民主人士在座谈会上的发言，有些意见当然是好的；但有些意见是不正确的。民革中央领导人之一的陈铭枢先生的发言，我认为是不够客观的，有否定一切的迹象。如他建议党取消学校中的党委制；并且在他看来中共中央和国务院联合发布指示是不妥当的。我本人是个非党群众，但我的看法却同陈铭枢先生的意见有原则的区别。
    在观察这些问题的时候，我觉得必须首先从这样一个最基本的事实出发，就是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民从一个胜利走向另一个胜利；党的无私和全心全意为人民服务的精神，获得了每一个没有偏见的中国人的热诚拥护；工人、农民和手工业劳动者以及一些原来属于各种信仰的人，都以自己有共产党和伟大毛主席的领导而感到自豪；人民群众，首先是基本群众热爱党、热爱自己的伟大领袖毛主席是根据切身的经验所得出的结论。因此，仅仅根据这一点，就足以说明党在各方面进行领导的绝对必要。
    党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度，我认为是好的制度，在企业中实行这一制度以后，官僚主义大大减少了；领导干部能走群众路线了；职工的积极性广泛的调动起来了。试问企业能够如此，为什么学校中就要特殊呢？我认为应当把党的领导看成是一个人的神经中枢一样。党应该对各方面的工作进行领导，不然就会迷失方向。我们人民群众都懂得这一点，承认和拥护党的领导是全国人民的意志。如果在学校中取消党委制，那是一个绝大的错误。真正爱国的人民是不能同意的。至于说到党中央和国务院不能联合发布指示，这种说法是不能说服人的。说老实话，由于党和毛主席在人民群众中无限的威信，劳动人民在报上看到党中央的指示，比如像最近的整风指示和参加体力劳动的指示都给了我们人民群众以巨大的力量。我想如果民主人士深入到工农群众中了解一下，对于这些民主人士会体会得更深的，这就说明向工、农学习，同样参加一部分体力劳动是完全必要的。
    关于党的领导问题和延长定息的时间问题，我建议人民日报反映有关部门，在人民群众中组织讨论，听一听广大工人、农民的意见，因为光是这些上层人士的意见，究竟还不能代表广大劳动人民的利益。
    编辑同志，希望你从速刊登我的这封信。
