To the Editor:

After reading Mr. Chu Anping's "speech," I could barely contain my anger.

First, let me state that I am also a non-Party member, and I have never published a single word in the newspaper before, but now I can no longer hold back and must express my personal opinion.

Mr. Chu Anping raises the issue of "the Party's world," as if using the phrase "the Party's world" as a curse to vent personal grievances. It can be seen that in the depths of Mr. Chu's ideology, he fundamentally does not recognize the leadership of the working class. In fact, Mr. Chu has forgotten a fact, namely that present-day China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Simply put, it is the world of the working people, specifically embodied in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Now the Communist Party is asking non-Party members to offer opinions in order to help the Party rectify its work, so that the working people's "world" can be managed even better. It is not, as Mr. Chu dreams, to curse this world and turn it into another world.

Mr. Chu stated: "The ideological problem of 'the Party's world' is the ultimate source of all sectarianism, and the fundamental contradiction between the Party and non-Party members." I completely disagree with Mr. Chu's fallacy. I believe that the Party and sectarianism cannot be confused at all. As for improper personnel appointments and the bad conduct or shortcomings of individual Party members, that is precisely why the Party has proposed rectification. One cannot confuse the mistakes of individual Party members with the entire Communist Party. Why does Mr. Chu insist on linking them together and placing all the blame on the Party Central Committee? In my opinion, it is for no other reason than that Mr. Chu has two intentions: First, if "'the Party's world' is the ultimate source of all sectarianism," then, according to this formula, Mr. Chu's implication is: Socialism engaging in sectarianism against capitalism is the ultimate source of all sectarianism. I do not understand who Mr. Chu is representing, or what his position is. Although Mr. Chu also says he is building socialism, his true intention is to abolish the Chinese Communist Party, abolish socialism, and start "world harmony" from today to eliminate the ultimate source of sectarianism. Second, he wants to forcibly place the responsibility for the bad conduct of individual Party members on the Party Central Committee, completely misunderstanding why the Party proposed rectification, and attempting to incite anti-Party sentiment among non-Party members. In fact, not all non-Party members, as Mr. Chu hopes, will transform their opinions on the bad conduct of individual Party members into opinions against the Party.

Assuming that Mr. Chu's formula is correct, and that the Party Central Committee must be responsible for the mistakes of individual Party members, then should Mr. Chu's rude speech be the responsibility of the central committees of the democratic parties, or does it represent the democratic parties (because Mr. Chu is introduced in the newspaper as the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, the central organ of the democratic parties)? Of course, I cannot estimate the democratic parties in this way. Unfortunately, he is the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily!

What is most infuriating is that Mr. Chu actually uses abusive language like "young monk, old monk" to insult Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, who are most respected by the 600 million people and the hope of their happiness. This is an insult to the 600 million people. Perhaps Mr. Chu will not accept the 600 million people. Then let's say 99% of the people (and let's put the 1% on Mr. Chu's side) cannot tolerate it. At least I cannot agree with Mr. Chu's opinion, and he cannot put me on his "non-Party" side.

### 储安平先生的“意见”是否代表各民主党派？

    储安平先生的“意见”是否代表各民主党派？编辑同志：
    看了储安平先生的“发言”，怒火难压。
    首先申明，我也是个非党人士，从来没有在报上发表过一个字，可是现在却再也抑制不住，非提一提我个人的意见不可。
    储安平先生提出“党天下”的问题，好像把“党天下”三个字作为发泄私恨的咒词，可以看出储先生思想意识的深处，根本未承认工人阶级的领导。其实储先生忘了一件事实，即目前的中国是以工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，简单的说就是劳动人民的天下，具体体现在中国共产党的领导。现在共产党要求党外人士提意见，是为了帮助党整风，好把劳动人民的“天下”管得更好，并不是储先生所梦想的要把这个天下骂过来变为另一个天下的。
    储先生提出：“这个‘党天下’的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源，是党与非党之间矛盾的基本所在”。我完全不能同意储先生的这种谬论。我认为党和宗派主义根本不能混为一谈。至于用人不当，个别党员作风不好，有缺陷，那正是党所以提出要整风的原因。不能把个别党员的错误和整个共产党混为一谈。为什么储先生偏偏要把它联在一起，要把一切错误都加在党中央身上呢？我看不是别的，而是储先生有两个意图：其一，如果“‘党天下’的思想问题是一切宗派主义的最终根源”，按照这个公式推论，储先生言外之意是：社会主义在向资本主义闹宗派主义才是一切宗派主义的最终根源。我不理解储先生究竟是代表谁说的，立场是什么，虽然储先生也是说为建设社会主义，但真实意图是在取消中国共产党，取消社会主义，从今天开始就搞“世界大同”以消灭宗派主义的最终根源。其二是想将个别党员的作风不良的责任硬加在党中央身上，根本不理解党为什么要提出整风，企图煽动非党人士的反党情绪。其实非党人士并不全像储先生所希望的把对个别党员作风不良的意见转化为对党的意见。
    假定储先生论断的公式是对的，个别党员的错误一定要由党中央负责，那么储先生这个粗暴的发言，是否要由各民主党派中央来负责呢，或者是代表各民主党派说话呢（因报上介绍的储先生是各民主党派中央机关报——光明日报总编辑）？当然我不能这样来估计各民主党派，遗憾的是，他又是光明日报总编辑！
    最使人生气的是储先生竟用“小和尚、老和尚”这样的恶语对六亿人民最敬爱的人、幸福的寄托者毛主席和周总理辱骂起来，这是对六亿人民的侮辱。说六亿人民也许储先生不会服气。那就说99％的人民（那1％权且放在储先生的一边）是不能容忍的，至少我是不能同意储先生的意见的，他不能把我列入他的“非党”的一边。
