Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th. The 350,000 mu of wheat, as well as over 90,000 mu of barley and wheat-barley mix in Luoma Lake, northern Jiangsu Province, have all yielded a bumper harvest. In the five townships of Liwei, Niantou, and Qipan in the northern part of the lake, the average yield of 235,000 mu of wheat fields is 150 jin per mu, equivalent to the local wheat harvest level in 1955. In the eight townships of Zhihe, Luwei, and others in the southern part of the lake, the average yield of 240,000 mu of wheat fields is over 140 jin per mu, exceeding 1955 by more than ten jin.

Luoma Lake is a reservoir in the upper reaches of the Xinyi River. During the flood season, the upstream dams must be opened to release water. Therefore, every summer harvest here is an extremely tense battle against time and water. A slight oversight could mean that the abundant wheat harvest is in danger of being washed away or submerged at any time. As of the 9th, half of the 240,000 mu of wheat in Suqian County, in the southern part of the lake, had been harvested. It is expected that all of it can be harvested by the 12th. The agricultural cooperatives in the eight townships of the Yunhe and Xiaodian districts along the lake have invited 12,000 male and female laborers and over 300 head of cattle from nearby hilly areas with less wheat and agricultural cooperatives in economic crop areas to help with the wheat harvest. In Xinyi County, in the northern part of the lake, over 235,000 mu of wheat has also begun to be harvested successively. Most agricultural cooperatives expect to be able to harvest and transport it all before the 15th. At noon on the 8th, the farmers in Niantou, Liwei, Qipan, and other townships along the lake were very happy to hear that the People's Liberation Army had come to help with the rush harvest. On the morning of the 9th, the sky was overcast and rainy. In the fields stretching more than ten li from Liwei to Luwei, a new force of over 3,000 soldiers from a certain unit of the stationed People's Liberation Army appeared to help with the wheat harvest. Currently, the wheat harvest command posts set up by Suqian and Xinyi counties on the lakeside are both managed by responsible comrades from the county party committee. They go deep into the field during the day to check the work, and answer questions from various townships carefully over the phone in the evening.

### 不能让丰收的麦子被水冲走  江苏骆马湖农民抢割抢运

　　不能让丰收的麦子被水冲走
　　江苏骆马湖农民抢割抢运
    据新华社南京11日电  江苏省北部骆马湖内三十五万亩小麦以及九万多亩大麦和元麦，全部丰收。在湖的北部李圩、埝头、棋盘等五个乡，二十三万五千亩麦田平均每亩产一百五十斤，相等于1955年当地麦子的丰收水平。在湖的南部直河、陆圩等八个乡，二十四万亩麦田平均每亩产一百四十多斤，比1955年还超过十多斤。
    骆马湖是新沂河上游的一个水库，一到汛期，上游就要开坝放水。因此，这里每年夏收都是同水争时间的一场极其紧张的战斗。稍一疏忽，丰收的麦子有随时被水冲走或淹没的危险。到9日为止，在湖的南部宿迁县境内的二十四万亩麦子，已割好了一半。预计到12日，可以全部割完。沿湖地带的运河、晓店两个区八个乡的农业社，向附近麦少的山岗地带和经济作物区的农业社约请了一万二千名男、女劳动力和三百多条耕牛来帮助麦收。在湖的北部新沂县境内有二十三万五千多亩麦子也已经陆续开始收割。大部分农业社预计在15日以前就可以割好运好。8日中午，沿湖地带埝头、李圩、棋盘等乡农民听到解放军来帮助抢收，非常高兴。9日早晨天阴有雨，从李圩到芦圩十多里长的田野上，出现了驻地解放军某部三千多人帮助割麦的新力量。现在宿迁和新沂两县设在湖边的麦收指挥部，都是由县委负责同志掌握。他们白天深入现场检查工作，晚上在电话中细致地回答各乡的问题。
