Editor's Note: "Spring Wreath," a novel written by Japanese railway worker-turned-author Yoshuyuki Handa, was translated and published in our country last year. The story, based on true events in Hokkaido, Japan, recounts how an old railway worker named Lin and his seven-year-old daughter, Miyoko, were killed by American devils occupying Japan, reflecting the atrocities of American invaders and the struggle of the broad masses of Japanese working people against war and for peace. After reading this novel, the children of the "Shanghai Children's Palace" Literary Group wrote a letter to the original author, Mr. Yoshuyuki Handa. Recently, the children of the "Shanghai Children's Palace" Literary Group received a reply from Mr. Handa. The letter from the Chinese children and Mr. Handa's reply reflect the sincere friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. We are now publishing excerpts of these two letters as follows:

The letter from the children of the "Shanghai Children's Palace" Literary Group

Respected Mr. Yoshuyuki Handa:

We are members of the "Shanghai Children's Palace" Literary Group. During our summer vacation, we read your work, "Spring Wreath," and invited Comrade Qu Mai, the translator, to participate in our symposium.

After reading this book, we felt that the Japanese people under the occupation of American imperialism were very miserable. We greatly admire the spirit of unity and friendship among your railway workers; we sympathize with the difficult situation of Japanese workers and farmers. However, that maintenance section chief is a degenerate among the Japanese people, a lackey of American imperialism, which makes us very hate him. We have heard that there are tens of millions of unemployed and semi-employed people in your country, and many children are wandering the streets. These are all disasters caused by American imperialism. We deeply sympathize with and love the protagonists in the book—Miyoko and her father, Old Lin. We think Old Lin is really good. No matter what severe torture he endures, he does not yield, and he does not betray the conscience of the Japanese people until his sacrifice. We know that there are many people like Old Lin in Japan. Your struggle will achieve final victory, and your struggle is not isolated.

The Chinese people love peace. We are fortunate to be born in New China; our people's government and our fathers and brothers care for us in every possible way, enabling us to grow freely and live more happily and joyfully.

We hope that you will have more works introduced to China, so that we can see the full spirit and firm confidence of the Japanese people in struggle, and see the lives of more Japanese children. Goodbye!

Please give our best regards to the Japanese children. We wish you good health and the Japanese people victory in their struggle!

专栏：书信来往

    编者按　日本铁路工人出身的作家半田义之写的小说“春天的花圈”一书，去年在我国翻译出版。内容是通过铁路工人老林和他七岁的独生女儿小美代被占领日本的美国鬼子害死的故事，反映了美国侵略者的暴行和日本广大劳动人民反对战争、争取和平的斗争。小说是根据发生在日本北海道的真人真事写成的。“上海市少年宫”文学小组的小朋友们阅读了这本小说之后，曾写信给原作者半田义之先生。最近“上海市少年宫”文学小组的小朋友们接到了半田先生的回信。中国小朋友的信和半田先生的回信，反映了中日两国人民之间的真挚友谊，现在把这两封信摘要发表如下：
    “上海市少年宫”文学小组的小朋友们的去信敬爱的半田义之先生：
    我们是“上海市少年宫”文学小组的组员，我们在暑假里读过了您的著作“春天的花圈”，并且请译者瞿麦同志来参加了我们的座谈会。
    我们读了这本书，觉得在美帝国主义占领下的日本人民是很痛苦的。我们很钦佩你们铁路工人团结友爱的精神；我们很同情日本工人和农民的困难处境。可是那个养路段长却是个日本人民中的败类，是美帝国主义的走狗，使我们非常憎恨。我们听说在你们国家里有上千万失业和半失业的人，很多儿童流浪在街头，这都是美帝国主义所造成的灾难。我们很同情和热爱书中的主人翁——小美代和她的爸爸老林。我们觉得老林真好，无论什么严刑拷打，他都不屈服，一直到牺牲也没有违背日本人民的良心。我们知道，在日本像老林那样的人有许许多多。你们的斗争是会取得最后胜利的，你们的斗争也不是孤立的。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。我们庆幸自己生长在新中国；我们的人民政府、我们的父兄们无微不至地关怀我们，使我们能够自由地成长，生活得更幸福、更愉快。
    我们希望您有更多作品介绍到中国，让我们看到日本人民在斗争中的饱满精神和坚强的信心，看到更多日本小朋友的生活。再见吧！
    请您代向日本小朋友问好。祝您身体健康，祝日本人民斗争胜利！
