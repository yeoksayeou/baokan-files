Exhaust Every Means to Create Miracles: A Master of Steel Conservation

Wei Qingyu, a layout worker at the Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, has saved 250 tons of steel for the country in three years. This news has attracted the attention of people across the country. He is known as a master of steel conservation.

How can a layout worker save so much steel? Wei Qingyu said: A layout worker is like a tailor, who should always think about saving. You can't use good fabric as inferior fabric, and you can't use a large piece of fabric to mend socks. For example, before cutting materials, you must study the drawings in detail, be familiar with the drawings, and see if there are any errors in the drawings, what kind of steel must be used, and whether old materials can be used. In a word, you must always think that the country needs a lot of steel during the period of large-scale construction, and the country's current steel production is not yet large, so we must try every means to save these precious steels.

Many workers believe that it is difficult for layout workers to avoid making mistakes during work. However, Wei Qingyu has adopted some effective methods in his layout work and has never made a mistake in recent years. Many people think this is a miracle.

In 1951, Wei Qingyu was still a cart driver. In October of that year, he was admitted to the training class of the Metal Structure Factory and began to learn technology. After graduating in 1952, he worked as an apprentice in the factory. He officially became a layout worker in 1953. He worked hard to study his profession and made rapid progress. Over the years, he has become an excellent blast furnace body layout and material numbering worker. In recent years, he and the team he led have laid out and numbered five furnace bodies, one of which, at his suggestion, changed the original design, saving the country 50 or 60 tons of good steel. In 1954, he was named an advanced producer in the workshop. In 1955 and 1956, he attended the Anshan City Advanced Producer Conferences. This year, he was again awarded the Youth League Central Committee's award for saving three major raw materials. (Attached picture)

    Familiar with the specifications of waste steel in the factory and using old materials as much as possible without affecting the quality of work is one of the ways that worker Wei Qingyu can often save steel.

    One day, Wei Qingyu was lying in bed when he suddenly remembered something, got up quickly, braved the wind and snow to rush to the factory, and rechecked the situation of his work instructions. It turned out there was no mistake.

Since Wei Qingyu's experience in saving steel has spread, the workers who learn from him have made significant achievements. The material numbering team in the second workshop saved eleven tons of steel in one month.

In March of this year, Wei Qingyu received an award from the Central Committee of the Youth League. He took the certificate home, and the whole family was happy, truly "one person wins an award, the whole family is honored."

    千方百计创奇迹  节约钢材称能手
    鞍山钢铁公司金属结构制造厂划线工人魏庆余，在三年当中，为国家节约了二百五十吨钢材。这个消息引起全国人民的注意。他被人们称为节约钢材的能手。
    一个划线工人怎样能够节约这么许多钢材？魏庆余说：划线工好像一个裁缝，应该处处想到节约。不能把好布当次布使，不能用大块布去补袜子。比方说，在下料以前，要详细研究图纸，熟悉图纸，看图纸上是不是有差误，必须使用那种钢材，是不是可以利用旧料。一句话，要时时刻刻想到国家在大建设的时期需要许多钢材，国家目前生产的钢材还不多，所以要千方百计节约这些珍贵的钢材。
    许多工人认为，划线工人在工作的时候很难不出差错。但是，魏庆余在划线工作当中，采用一些有效的办法，几年来从未出过差错。许多人都认为这是一种奇迹。
    魏庆余在1951年还是一个赶大车工人。当年10月份，他考上了金属结构厂训练班开始学习技术，1952年毕业后，就在该厂当学徒工。到1953年正式作划线工。他努力钻研业务，进步很快，几年来，他已经成为一个出色的高炉炉体划线、号料工人。几年以来，他和他领导的小组划线、号料的炉体有五个，其中有一个在他的建议下改变了原来的设计，给国家节约了五、六十吨好钢材。1954年，他被评为车间的先进生产者。1955和1956年，他先后出席了鞍山市的先进生产者会议。今年，他又受到青年团中央三大原材料的节约奖励。（附图片）

    有一天，魏庆余睡在床上，突然想起一件什么事来，急忙起身，冒着风雪赶到厂里，复查他交代工作的情况，结果并没有错。
    自从魏庆余节约钢材的经验传播开来以后，跟他学习的工人们都有了显著成绩。第二车间里的号料小组，在一个月内就节约了十一吨钢材。
    今年3月里，魏庆余受到了团中央的奖励。他把奖状拿回家里，全家都乐了，真是“一人得奖，全家光荣”。
