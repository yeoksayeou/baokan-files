(Reported from Guangzhou on the 16th by our newspaper) Many returned overseas Chinese and compatriots who have returned from Hong Kong and Macao in Guangzhou have vehemently denounced the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements.

    Wang Tingjun, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: "The vast majority of us overseas Chinese are patriotic. In the past, when we were overseas, we suffered all kinds of bullying from imperialism because of the corrupt and incompetent Kuomintang government. How much we hoped for an independent, free, and strong motherland! Decades of experience have proven that the Kuomintang cannot fulfill our wishes. Fortunately, the Communist Party came, drove out the three major enemies, and the achievements of the Communist Party's construction in just eight years are admired by all overseas Chinese. The international prestige of the motherland is increasing day by day, and the thirteen million overseas Chinese are no longer orphans abroad." Wang Tingjun said angrily that Ge Peiqi's statement that China would not perish without the Communist Party was a heartless statement and had ulterior motives. He said that we overseas Chinese wholeheartedly support the Communist Party, and we firmly oppose the absurd remarks of Ge Peiqi and others.

    Fan Ziying, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: "Overseas Chinese affirm the leadership of the Party. Some people attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Party. Does that mean they want Chiang Kai-shek to return? We overseas Chinese do not agree to that." He said: "I was wandering overseas at the age of fifteen, and I did not return to the motherland until the end of 1954. I was overseas for thirty years, and I always missed my motherland, but at that time, there were kidnappings and robberies everywhere in the country; the money I brought back went from big to small, from small to nothing. Who would dare to come back? After liberation, I moved my whole family back. I completely trust the Communist Party."

    Situ Wen, an old overseas Chinese worker who returned from the United States after liberation, said: "I worked in the United States for more than thirty years and suffered all kinds of contempt from imperialism and exploitation from capitalists. Why did imperialism bully us Chinese people? Wasn't it the result of the reactionary government? I worked for decades, living a life worse than cattle and horses, and only saved some money to send back to China, but it was swallowed up by the Kuomintang-run banks. I never dreamed that after liberation, the People's Government would repay me the money that had been swallowed up by the Kuomintang. Such a thing can only happen under the leadership of the Communist Party." He said: "I have suffered all kinds of hardships in my life and have seen several governments, but I have never seen such a good government as the one under the leadership of the Communist Party. I wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party. Whoever slanders and undermines the Communist Party, I will, together with the people, never forgive him."

    Lin Zhiwei, who just returned to Guangzhou from Hong Kong, said, "Ge Peiqi said that China would not perish without the Communist Party. I cannot find a trace of Chinese sentiment in his words. We know that in the past, the motherland was full of disasters, famine, and death. We compatriots living in Hong Kong and Macao have also been unable to hold our heads high under the oppression of imperialism for a long time. Only the Communist Party has come to make the motherland prosperous and strong, and has brought honor and hope to millions of overseas Chinese. Facts have proved that without the Communist Party, China would have no hope."

### 广州市的归国华侨说  爱国同胞决不允许毁谤共产党

　　广州市的归国华侨说
　　爱国同胞决不允许毁谤共产党
    本报广州16日电　广州市许多归国华侨和从港澳回来的同胞，纷纷痛斥右派分子的反动言论。
    广州市归国华侨联合会副主任王廷俊说：“我们华侨绝大多数是爱国的，过去我们在海外，由于国民党政府腐败无能，受尽了帝国主义的欺侮。我们多么希望有一个独立、自由、强大的祖国。几十年的经验证明了，国民党是不能实现我们的愿望的。好在共产党来了，驱逐了三大敌人，共产党领导下的短短八年的建设成就，华侨无不赞叹。祖国的国际威望日益提高，一千三百万华侨不再是海外孤儿了。”王廷俊气愤地说，葛佩琦说没有共产党，中国不会亡，那是没有良心说的话，是别有企图。他说，我们华侨衷心拥护共产党，我们坚决反对葛佩琦等人的荒唐言论。
    广东省归国华侨联合会副主任范子英说：“华侨对党的领导是肯定的，有些人企图推翻党的领导，难道再叫蒋介石回来，那我们华侨是不同意的。”他说：“我十五岁就流落在海外，一直到1954年底才回到祖国。我在海外三十年，时时刻刻想念着自己的祖国，但是那时国内到处是绑票、抢劫；带回来的钱，由大变小，由小变无，谁敢回来呢？解放了，我才把全家搬了回来，我是完全相信共产党的。”
    解放后才从美国回来的华侨老工人司徒文说：“我在美国做了三十多年的工，受尽了帝国主义的轻视和资本家的剥削。为什么帝国主义会欺侮我们中国人呢？还不是反动政府招来的结果。我做了几十年的工，过着牛马不如的生活，才积蓄了一些钱寄回国内，却被国民党官办的银行吞没了。做梦也想不到，解放后人民政府把我被国民党吞没了的钱偿还给我。这样的事情：只有共产党领导下才会有。”他说：“我这一辈子受尽了风霜雨雪，曾看见过好几个政府，就没有见到像共产党领导下这样好的政府。我是衷心拥护共产党领导的。谁要是毁谤和破坏共产党，我将和人民群众一道，决不饶恕他。”
    刚从香港回到广州的林志伟说，“葛佩琦说没有共产党，中国不会亡，从他这句话里，我找不到一丝一毫中国人的味道。我们知道，过去祖国到处是灾难、饥饿和死亡。我们居住在港澳的同胞，也长期在帝国主义压迫下抬不起头来。只有共产党来了，才使祖国繁荣富强起来，才给千百万侨居海外的同胞，带来荣誉和希望。事实证明，没有共产党，中国就没有希望。”
