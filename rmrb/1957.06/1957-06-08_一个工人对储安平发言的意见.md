To the Editor:

I am a loyal reader of your newspaper. I come from a printing worker's background. I started learning the printing trade at the age of eleven, and now I am forty-three years old. I have experienced the dark society of various ruling periods and suffered from unemployment and hunger. It was not until Beijing's liberation in 1949 that I had a home (factory). In the more than eight years since liberation, through a series of revolutionary education and movements, my thinking and awareness have also improved. Now, how to solve the current problem of internal contradictions among the people in our country is the most important focus for every person who cares about the cause of socialist construction. After reading Mr. Chu Anping's speech at the United Front Work Department meeting on June 2nd, published in your newspaper, I believe that the spirit of this speech is wrong, especially his talk of a "one-family-dominated, monolithic situation" and a "Party-dominated world." He even made jokes about the leaders of the Party in his speech, which is really inappropriate!

From the day I had memory, I have personally experienced so many great changes: from the Zhili-Fengtian Wars to the Yan-Feng campaign against Chiang, to the loss of Northeast China on September 18th, followed by the enslavement of the twenty-two counties in eastern Hebei, the Lugouqiao Incident, and the fall of North China. Does Mr. Chu Anping still remember these humiliations? Does Mr. Chu know about the Xi'an Incident on December 12, 1936? Who resolved the siege, broke the deadlock, and promoted the united front against Japan? Has Mr. Chu forgotten these things? Who went deep behind enemy lines to lead the broad masses of the people and establish anti-Japanese base areas, forcing the Japanese warlords to only occupy points and lines but unable to consolidate their occupied areas? Does Mr. Chu know? Who liberated Siping, Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and other places? Don't you know about the Huaihai Campaign, the Tianjin Campaign, and the peaceful liberation of Beijing (formerly Beiping)? Have you heard of the southward advance of the army, the peaceful uprising in Hunan, the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, and so on? Who led us to achieve such great victories as mentioned above? Isn't it all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party? Who dares to say that it is not entirely due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party leaders! Take the current issue of resolving internal contradictions among the people in China as an example. Even the imperialist countries cannot deny that this is a manifestation of the rock-solid stability of the People's Government of New China. The people of the whole country support the Communist Party and are proud to have such a strong Communist Party leadership. However, only Mr. Chu Anping regards the leadership of the Communist Party as a nationwide major shortcoming, complaining about a "monolithic Party-dominated world." But with Mr. Chu Anping's brilliance, he certainly knows these basic principles. Why did he say these muddled words? Does this not show that Mr. Chu Anping's thinking has its own class roots?

Since 1953, our country has been conducting universal suffrage at the grassroots level. The representatives produced from the grassroots districts to the counties, provinces, and cities are all elected by secret ballot. The highest organ of state power in our country is the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Even fifth-grade elementary school students understand this political common sense. How can Mr. Chu Anping not be clear about it? Aren't the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress produced through consultations among various democratic parties, organizations, and non-party figures? It can be said that the highest state leadership organs already include representatives from all aspects. How can it be called a monolithic Party-dominated world? Mr. Chu Anping said that after the reorganization of the government, the chairs of several leaders of democratic parties in the original Central People's Government were moved to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Are these chairs moved to the wrong place? As for the fact that there is not a single non-Party person among the Vice-Premiers, is this "the fundamental source of the contradiction between the Party and non-Party people today?" I think Mr. Chu Anping's speech is not helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style, but rather seems to be vying for the chair of a Vice-Premier for someone.

The above is the situation of the high-level state leadership organs. Looking at our workshop, are all the leaders Communist Party members in a monolithic fashion? In our offset printing workshop, there is a non-Party workshop director. In my auxiliary work group, one of the two group leaders is not a Party member, and they get along very well with the director and the other group leader.

In Mr. Chu Anping's speech, he called the Communist Party members "little monks" and the Communist Party leaders "old monks." Editors and readers, let's discuss this together. What does this mean? This is what I, as a worker, want to ask Mr. Chu Anping. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou are the beloved leaders of the people of the whole country, and the vast number of cadres are diligent servants who wholeheartedly serve the people. We workers do not allow Mr. Chu Anping to be so rude to them!

Because I myself have a low level of education, I do not have a deep or thorough understanding of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and I don't understand what to contend for, what to sound out, or what to let bloom. However, since the liberation of Beijing, I have cured my allergic rhinitis. If I were in the past, I wouldn't dare to say it because my sense of smell was poor and I couldn't smell the fragrance or the stench. Now, I have at least the ability to distinguish between them. We workers are willing to smell the fragrance of a hundred flowers blooming. As for poisonous gas, we have no choice but to avoid it and even have to argue with the person who releases the poison. We hope that Chu Anping will think calmly, remember the source of the water, and not forget the peasant brothers who worked hard and sweated to sow the seeds while eating white flour.

Editor: I am not using this platform to engage in a paper war by writing this manuscript. However, I hope that my understanding can be published in your newspaper so that our working class can have a correct understanding of Chu Anping's speech. This is what it means by "you sound out and I sound out, you contend and I contend, you let bloom and I let bloom."

### 一个工人对储安平发言的意见

专栏：

    一个工人对储安平发言的意见编辑同志：
    我是贵报的一个忠实读者，我出身是一个印刷工人，从十一周岁学习印刷手艺，到现在我已四十三周岁啦。我曾经历过各个统治时期的黑暗社会，受过失业饥饿的折磨。1949年北京解放后，我才算有了老家（厂子）啦。解放八年多，经过一系列的革命教育和运动，我思想和觉悟也提高了。现在，如何解决我国当前人民内部矛盾问题，是每一位关心社会主义建设事业者的最注目的中心点。我看了6月2日，你报刊载了储安平先生在统战部会议上的发言，我认为这个发言的精神是错误的，特别是他谈到的“一家天下的清一色局面”、“党天下”等。他的发言中还拿党的领袖开玩笑，实在太不应该！
    从我有记忆能力这天起，亲身经历过多少大变化：从直奉战争——阎冯讨蒋，到九一八东北失陷，相继冀东二十二县奴化，芦沟桥事变，华北沦陷，这些个耻辱，不知道储安平先生还记得吗？1936年12月12日西安事变，储先生知道吗？是谁给解的围，打开了僵局，促成了枪口对外，一致抗日？这些事储先生忘了吗？又是谁深入敌后领导广大人民，建立抗日根据地，逼迫的日本军阀光能占点线，不能巩固占领区，储先生你知道吗？四平街、沈阳、长春、营口等地是谁解放的，淮海的战役、天津战役、北京（前北平）和平解放，你不知道吗？大军南下、湖南和平起义、绥远和平解放等等，你听说过吗？以上这样大的胜利是谁领导的取得的呢？难道说不是全靠共产党的领导吗？谁敢说不是全靠共产党的领导人的英明呢！就拿当前人民的中国解决内部矛盾问题这件事来说，连帝国主义国家，也不能不承认这是新中国的人民政府固如磐石的表现。全国人民拥护共产党，并且因为有这样强大的共产党的领导而骄傲。不过，惟有储安平先生把共产党的领导说成是全国性的大缺点，抱怨什么“清一色的党天下”。可是，以储安平先生的高明，当然不会不知道这些粗浅的道理的，他为什么又说出这些糊涂话呢？这是不是说明了储安平先生的思想有他自己的阶级根源呢？
    我们的国家自从1953年开始在各基层进行普选以后，由基层区到县省市产生出来的代表，都是用无记名投票选出来的。我们国家最高权力机关是全国人民代表大会和人大常委会。这种政治常识就连五年级小学生他们都明白的。怎么像储安平先生还不清楚呢？人大常委会的委员长和副委员长难道不是由各民主党派、团体和无党派人士协商产生出来的吗？可以说国家最高领导机关，已经包括了各个方面的代表啦。怎么叫清一色的党天下呢？储安平先生说政府改组后，原中央人民政府几位民主党派领导人的椅子搬到人大常委会去啦，难道这些椅子搬错了地方了？至于说到副总理中没有一个非党人士，难道这就是今天“党和非党之间矛盾的基本所在吗？”我看储安平先生的发言，不是在帮助共产党整风，倒像是在为谁争副总理的椅子。
    上面说的是国家高级领导机关的情况。就从我们这个车间来看，是不是都是共产党员清一色当头儿呢？我们胶印车间就有一个非党的车间主任，我在的这个辅助工组两个组长，一个就不是党员，并且在主任和组长之间，都相处得很好。
    储安平先生的发言中，把共产党的党员称作小和尚，把共产党的领导人当作老和尚。请编者和读者们，咱们大家来讨论讨论吧，这究竟是什么意思？这是我这个工人要向储安平先生请教的。毛主席、周总理是全国人民热爱的领袖，广大干部是忠心为人民服务的勤务员，我们工人不容许储安平先生对他们这样无礼！
    因为我本人文化低，对百花齐放，百家争鸣，了解的不深不透，也不懂争什么？鸣什么？都放什么？但是从北京解放以后，我自己把鼻子过敏性鼻炎治痊愈啦。如果我在过去可不敢说，因为我嗅觉差，闻不到那是香味，那是臭味。现在，我已经有了起码的辨别能力了。我们工人们愿闻百花放的香。对毒瓦斯，我们就不得不避而远之，甚至要跟放毒的人争一争。我们希望储安平自己平心想想，饮水思源，不要吃白面却忘了出力流汗播种的农民兄弟们。
    编辑同志：我写这篇稿子，不是借园地打笔仗。不过我希望能把我这种认识在您报刊载出来，使我们工人队伍内对储安平的发言得到正确的认识。这才叫做你鸣我也鸣，你争我也争，你放我也放。
