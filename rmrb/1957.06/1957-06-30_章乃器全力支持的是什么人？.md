Huang Miaofu, a student at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School and the private manager of the joint state-private Xin Xiandai Laomei Textbook Craft Factory, sent three reactionary mimeographed pamphlets called "Ming Wen" (Speaking Out) to Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Shanghai's party and government leading organs, industrial and commercial federations in various provinces and cities, and other places, starting in mid-May. These pamphlets were filled with slanderous and inflammatory rhetoric, and expressed wholehearted support for Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. The third "Ming Wen" included a reply letter from Zhang Naiqi to him dated May 25. In the letter, Zhang Naiqi said: "I deeply sympathize with your experience and fully support you to thoroughly 'ming' (speak out) and thoroughly 'fang' (unleash)... In the future, if anyone dares to retaliate against you, I will definitely do my best to support you."

Mores Savage than Past Tyrants in Cursing the Government
In these pamphlets, Huang Miaofu cursed the Communist Party and the People's Government, using the most vicious terms. He said that in the early days of liberation, the government "slashed the price" when buying a house he owned in Wenzhou; in 1954, he was "extorted" for a sum of tax. He said: "Such officials are more savage than the tyrants of the past, even worse." "In the past reactionary era, if you encountered such a tyrant, there were two ways to go, one was to sue in court, but it cost some litigation fees; the other was to walk under the tyrant's door and use some under-the-table money, perhaps to get a reasonable solution, but it would never be rigidly stipulated, with not a penny added. Comparing the two, who is evil and who is good can be distinguished without thinking."

Public Representatives “Riding on the Heads of the People”
Huang Miaofu slandered the public representatives as "individualistic heroes riding on the heads of the people." In his view, "public representatives have neither morality nor talent. If they have morality and talent, it is the ability to be fierce and ruthless, to beat people bloody, and to be indiscriminately considered 'moral'... Being able to fabricate charges and frame people is 'talent'." Therefore, after the public representatives were sent, "the warm enterprise became a world of terror." He claimed: "Most of the private sector is crying bitterly, 'living in darkness', 'reversing right and wrong', 'unable to distinguish between black and white'. In such a situation, I would never believe that the world would not be in great chaos."

In the "Ming Wen," Huang Miaofu also insulted workers and activists, and pleaded for the "peasants" and "martyrs' families," saying that the government treated military families and martyrs' families differently, provoking their dissatisfaction with the Party and the government.

Huang Miaofu Is the One Riding on the Heads of the People
In the past half month, students at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School and employees of the Xin Xiandai Craft Factory have counterattacked Huang Miaofu's reactionary arguments. According to the materials that have been revealed, Huang Miaofu himself is a figure with a hidden history who rides on the heads of the people. Before liberation, when he was in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, he had close ties with many Kuomintang party and government leaders. He even had his son recognize Shi Peiqing, the director of the Kuomintang Wenzhou City Police Bureau, as his godfather. Huang Miaofu himself also served as a commissioner of the Kuomintang business tax bureau. Zhang Dezi and Yan Peiqiu, students at the Political School, revealed that Huang Miaofu relied on the influence of certain Kuomintang figures to threaten legitimate industrialists and businessmen and defraud them of money before liberation. Student Chen Xizhan said that a group of people who were extremely close to Huang Miaofu in the past and depended on each other for survival were all suppressed by the government after liberation. Huang Miaofu still treasures photos of these local bullies.

Started by Swindling and Cruel Exploitation
How did Huang Miaofu's Xin Xiandai Craft Factory start? According to disclosures by employees of the enterprise and staff members of the Luwan District Store of the state-owned Municipal Cultural Goods Company, Huang Miaofu was only a peddler when he came to Shanghai in 1951, doing mobile sales of bookmarks. His capital was less than 400 yuan, and he consistently lost money. Later, he used the label of a martyr's family to engage in activities everywhere, and received care from Xinhua Bookstore, which purchased his products. The People's Bank also repeatedly provided loans, and his business improved.

Within his enterprise, he always adopted cruel methods of exploiting workers, always hiring temporary workers. With a meager wage of one yuan per day, he required workers to work from morning until midnight, sometimes even requiring them to work without pay. He treated temporary workers with a three-month rotation system. If a worker was slightly dissatisfied or talked with a tax bureau cadre, they would be dismissed. In the past few years, no fewer than 100 workers have been kicked out by Huang Miaofu. Huang Miaofu's statement that "the warm enterprise has become a world of terror" after the joint venture is a complete reversal of black and white. The employees' situation only changed after the joint venture, and this change is precisely what Huang Miaofu hates the most.

Because of his cruel exploitation of employees, his enterprise often obtained several times the profit. By the time of the joint state-private ownership last year, he actually had more than 26,000 yuan in assets, and could receive more than 1,000 yuan in fixed interest alone each year.

Ungrateful and Turning Around to Bite
Employees of the Xin Xiandai Craft Factory and staff members of the district store all believe that Huang Miaofu is completely ungrateful. The facts he cited in the "Ming Wen" are all malicious fabrications. The government bought his house in Wenzhou for 2,500 yuan, which was taking care of him at the time. Huang Miaofu himself had also expressed gratitude, because no one wanted the house at the time, and he wrote many letters to real estate brokers in Wenzhou, saying that he would be satisfied if he could sell it for 1,500 yuan. During the asset inventory of the enterprise after the joint venture, the government also gave him a lot of care, and even worthless things were valued. Even now, there are still many unwanted broken things piled up there. After the joint venture, Huang Miaofu received a high salary of 268 yuan per month. Together with his wife's salary and fixed interest income, he averaged 500 yuan per month. Last year, the enterprise also gave him a pre-joint venture bonus of more than 3,000 yuan. The furniture in Huang Miaofu's home has all been replaced with mahogany, and he has purchased new sofas and an electric refrigerator. But now he is turning around and biting, saying that the government has treated him unfairly and underestimated his assets by more than 10,000 yuan.

Shameful Status as a Martyr's Family
According to disclosures from Huang Miaofu's relatives, the sacrifice of his son, Huang Zhen, was also related to him. Huang Zhen participated in revolutionary work before liberation, and Huang Miaofu actively opposed it. He even asked Shi Peiqing, the director of the Kuomintang Wenzhou City Police Bureau, to talk to his son, which forced Huang Zhen to leave and eventually sacrifice himself. But after liberation, Huang Miaofu used this as a label of a martyr's family as capital for seeking personal gain and engaging in conspiracies to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. Playing Double-Faced Tactics to Prepare to Resist to the End

After the Political School and enterprise employees criticized Huang Miaofu, he used the excuse of illness to ask the school for a ten-day leave and secretly hid at home to play double-faced tactics. In a letter to the deputy director of education of the school, he said that the class teacher "instructed the group to open fire on me in a struggle-style, which is so rude that I cannot tolerate it personally." But in a letter to the classmates in the class, he said: "I am not well and need to rest, so I cannot come. I express my gratitude for the care of the class teacher and classmates!" Huang Miaofu expressed in a letter to the school that he would "close the door and think about his mistakes" and conduct a self-criticism, but then went to the Procuratorate to accuse the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily) of damaging his reputation.

　　章乃器全力支持的是什么人？
　　新华社记者　张家炽　叶世涛
    上海市工商界政治学校学员、公私合营新现代劳美教材工艺社私方经理黄苗夫，在5月中旬起，连续向毛主席，民建中央，上海的党政领导机关、各省市工商联等地寄发了三次称作“鸣文”的反动油印小册子。这些小册子充满了诬蔑和煽动性论调，并对章乃器的谬论表示竭诚拥护。在第三次的“鸣文”中，登载着章乃器5月25日给他的复信，章乃器在信上说：“十分同情你的遭遇，全力支持你彻底地鸣，彻底地放……将来如有敢对于你打击报复，我一定尽棉薄为你撑腰。”
    骂政府比过去恶霸还凶狠
    黄苗夫在这些小册子中谩骂共产党和人民政府，用尽了最恶毒的词句。他说，解放初期，政府“杀价”购买他在温州的一幢房屋；1954年，又“敲诈”他一笔税款。他说：“这样的官方，比过去恶霸还凶狠，有过之无不及的。”“过去反动时代，如遇着这样恶霸，有两条路可走，一条路可向法院控告，不过用些诉讼费；另一条路，可走恶霸门下客，用些暗下钱，或可得到合理解决，决不致硬性规定，分文不加，两相比较，谁恶谁好，不想就可分清了。”
　　“骑在人民头上”的公方代表
    黄苗夫诬蔑公方代表是“骑在人民头上的个人英雄主义者。”在他看来，“公方代表无德又无才，如果说有德才，那就是能做凶，能做狠，打得血淋，与不分皂白的人算是‘德’，……能够制造无中生有戴人罪名是‘才’”。因此，公方代表派来以后“温暖的企业变成了恐怖世界”。他声称：“大多数私方在叫苦连天，‘暗无天日’，‘颠倒是非’，‘黑白难分’，在这样形势下，天下不大乱，我决不信也。”
    在“鸣文”中，黄苗夫还污辱工人和积极分子，为“农民”和“烈属”请命，说政府对待军属和烈属厚此薄彼，挑拨他们对党和政府的不满。
    黄苗夫才是个骑在人民头上的人物
    最近半个月来，上海工商界政治学校学员和新现代工艺社职工，对黄苗夫的反动论调进行了反击。从已经揭露出来的材料看，黄苗夫自己才是一个别有来历的骑在人民头上的人物。解放以前他在浙江温州的时候，和国民党的许多党政头子交往很密。他曾让他的儿子认国民党温州市警察局局长施培清为寄父。黄苗夫本人还做过国民党营业税局的专员。政治学校学员张德滋、严培秋揭露黄苗夫在解放前靠了国民党某些人物的牌头，威胁正当工商业者，诈骗钱财。学员陈锡沾说，过去和黄苗夫过从极密、相依为命的一伙人，解放后都先后被政府镇压了，这些恶霸的照片，现在仍由黄苗夫珍藏着。
    撞骗和残酷剥削起家
    黄苗夫的新现代工艺社是怎样起家的呢？据企业职工和国营市文化用品公司卢湾区店工作人员揭发，黄苗夫在1951年来上海时只是一个行商，做些书签流动推销，本钱不到四百元，而且一直亏本。后来他打着烈属招牌到处活动，得到新华书店照顾，收购他的产品，人民银行也屡次给予贷款，营业乃得好转。
    在他企业内部，一向采取残酷剥削工人的手段，一直雇用临时工，以每天一元钱的微薄工资，要工人从早上做到午夜，有时甚至不给工资也要工人做工。他对待临时工是采取三月轮换制，如果工人稍有不满，或者与税务局干部谈话，就要被辞退。这几年先后被黄苗夫踢出去的工人不下一百人。黄苗夫说合营后“温暖的企业变成了恐怖世界”完全是颠倒黑白，职工们只是在合营后处境才有所改变，而这种改变正是黄苗夫恨之切骨的原因。
    因为他残酷剥削职工，他的企业经常获得数倍的利润，到去年公私合营时候，居然有了二万六千多元资产，每年光是定息就可拿一千多元。
    忘恩负义，反咬一口
    新现代工艺社职工和区店工作人员都认为，黄苗夫完全是个忘恩负义之徒，他在“鸣文”中举的那些事实，都是恶意的捏造。他在温州的那幢房屋，政府以二千五百元买下，在当时是照顾他的，黄苗夫本人也曾表示感激，因为当时没有人要这房子，写了许多信给温州的地产掮客，表示能卖一千五百元就满足了。企业合营后的清产核资中，政府也给他很多照顾，许多不值钱的东西也核了价，至今还有不少没人要的破烂东西积压在那里。合营以后，黄苗夫每月拿着二百六十八元的高薪，连同他妻子的薪金和定息收入，平均每月有五百元。去年，企业还给他一笔合营前的红利三千多元。黄苗夫家里的家具已全部换成红木的，新购了沙发和电气冰箱，而他现在却反咬一口，说政府亏待了他，少算他资产一万多元。
    烈属身分得来可耻
    根据黄苗夫的亲戚揭发，他儿子黄镇的牺牲，原来也同他不无关系。黄镇解放前参加革命工作，黄苗夫积极反对，还曾叫国民党温州市警察局长施培清找他儿子谈话，黄镇因而被迫出走，以致牺牲。但解放以后，黄苗夫就此打起烈属招牌，作为谋私利和进行反对共产党的领导、反对社会主义阴谋活动的资本。玩弄两面手法准备顽抗到底
    政治学校和企业职工对黄苗夫进行批判以后，他就借口生病向学校请了十天假，私下躲在家里耍弄两面手法。他在写给该校副教务长的信中说，班主任“指使小组向我作斗争式开火，如此粗暴，个人难以容忍”。但在给班上同学的信中却说：“我病不好要休息，不能来。对班主任、同学的关心表示感谢！”黄苗夫在给学校的信中表示要“闭门思过”，进行检查，但又去检察院控告新闻日报破坏他的名誉。
