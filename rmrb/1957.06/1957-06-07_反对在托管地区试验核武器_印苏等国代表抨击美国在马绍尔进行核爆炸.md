Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, New York dispatch: Indian Defense Minister Menon criticized the United States at the UN Trusteeship Council on June 5th for using the Marshall Islands for atomic nuclear explosion tests.

The Trusteeship Council is currently holding a meeting to discuss issues related to trust territories. Menon said in his speech that the United States had used the Marshall Islands for atomic nuclear explosion tests, and there is currently no guarantee that these islands will not be used for further similar explosion tests.

He said that these islands are the homeland of the people who live there, and using them as testing grounds is a violation of the concept of trusteeship.

Menon also criticized the Council for not strictly discussing the issue of atomic nuclear explosion tests in trust territories. He requested the Council to discuss whether these tests can be carried out within trust territories.

Burmese representative U Ba Swe, in his speech at the same day's meeting, called for the conclusion of an international agreement to stop all nuclear weapons tests. He said that only in this way can the fear of nuclear explosion tests among the residents of the Pacific Islands be eliminated.

Soviet representative Lobanov also raised the proposal to ban nuclear explosion tests at the June 3rd meeting. He pointed out that the United States' carrying out of such tests on Pacific Islands is a serious hazard to the local residents and a violation of the trusteeship agreement.

    印苏等国代表抨击美国在马绍尔进行核爆炸
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：印度国防部长梅农6月5日在联合国托管理事会上抨击美国使用马绍尔群岛进行原子核爆炸试验。
    托管理事会目前正在举行会议讨论有关托管地的问题。梅农在会上发言说，美国曾经使用马绍尔群岛进行原子核爆炸试验，而目前并不能保证这些岛屿不会用来进行进一步的类似的爆炸试验。
    他说，这些岛屿是住在那里的人民的祖国，把它们当作试验场地是违反托管概念的。
    梅农还批评理事会没有严格讨论在托管地进行原子核爆炸试验的问题。他要求理事会讨论这些试验是否可以在托管领土内进行。
    缅甸代表吴包廷在同一天会议上的发言中要求缔结一项国际协定，停止进行所有核武器试验。他说，只有这样才可以消除太平洋岛屿的居民对于核爆炸试验的恐惧。
    苏联代表洛巴诺夫在6月3日会议上也提出了禁止进行核爆炸试验的主张。他指出，美国在太平洋岛屿上进行这种试验是对当地居民的严重危害，而且是违反关于托管协定的。
