　　Promoting the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign Through Rectification
　　Changchun Municipal Party Committee Requires All Units to Comprehensively Arrange Work, Ensuring Both Rectification and Production are Not Delayed
    (Our Newspaper News) The Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has requested Party organizations at all levels to further promote the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy through rectification.
    The Municipal Party Committee has put forward the indicators, priorities, and measures for this year's increase production and practice economy campaign. In terms of capital construction, with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, the capital construction plans of ten units were revised, reducing the construction task by 51,800 square meters of building area, and a total investment of 4.36 million yuan was cut. In terms of industrial production, based on the characteristics of the city's industries, which are mostly processing enterprises and rely almost entirely on state allocation and procurement from other regions for industrial raw materials, it was determined to focus on saving raw materials and improving product quality. In addition, saving methods were proposed for equipment, funds, and institutions. By adopting these measures, the city's local industries can increase production by 8.5 million yuan, save 3.74 million yuan, and reduce costs by 8.25%.
    In order to further promote the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires Party organizations at all levels to pay attention to solving the following problems. First, strengthen the planning of the city's economic work, and pay special attention to mastering and studying the proportional relationships between various economies, between production and life, between the arrangement of production tasks and the supply of raw materials, between changes in purchasing power and the supply of materials, etc., and make timely adjustments. Furthermore, it is necessary to promptly inspect and adjust plans based on the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, so that the plans are more realistic, in order to continuously promote the in-depth development of the campaign. Second, organize city-wide production collaboration. Based on the tasks, equipment capacity, and material resources of various enterprises, organize production collaboration between state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and handicraft industries throughout the city, especially between enterprises with materials but insufficient equipment and enterprises with surplus equipment capacity but lacking materials. Third, uniformly arrange industrial production and capital construction materials throughout the city. For materials allocated by the state, make necessary adjustments according to the degree of importance and urgency; for local materials, uniformly allocate and share resources. At the same time, mutual collaboration is necessary in the use of raw materials. Fourth, gradually resolve the institutional issues in economic work and other aspects of work.
    At present, the rectification movement is underway throughout the city. All units must comprehensively arrange work in accordance with the principle of ensuring that both rectification and production are not delayed. Promote the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign through rectification. Leaders at all levels must solve the problems discovered in the rectification in a step-by-step manner. At the same time, in the spirit of rectification, educate all cadres to overcome the unrealistic ideas of blindly pursuing large-scale, modernization, mechanization, and standardization, and truly establish a fine style of hard work, plain living, and building the country with diligence and thrift.

　　通过整风推动增产节约运动
　　长春市委要求各单位全面安排工作，做到整风生产两不误
    本报讯  中共长春市委要求各级党组织通过整风，进一步推动增产节约运动的开展。
    市委提出了今年增产节约的指标、重点和措施。在基本建设方面，以增产节约精神，修改了十个单位的基本建设计划，减少了五万一千八百平方公尺建筑面积的建设任务，共削减投资四百三十六万元。在工业生产方面，根据全市绝大部分工业是加工性的企业、工业原料几乎全靠国家调拨和外地采购的特点，确定以节约原材料和改进产品质量为重点。此外，在设备、资金和机构等方面，也提出了节约的办法。采取这些办法，全市地方工业可增产八百五十万元，节约三百七十四万元，降低成本8.25％。
    为了进一步推动增产节约运动的开展，中共长春市委要求各级党组织注意解决以下几个问题。一，加强全市经济工作的计划性，特别要注意掌握和研究各种经济之间、生产与生活之间、生产任务安排与原材料供应之间、购买力变化与物资供应之间等等的比例关系，及时地加以调整。并且要根据增产节约运动发展的情况，及时检查，调整计划，使计划更能切合实际，以便不断推动运动的深入开展。二，组织全市性的生产协作。根据各企业的任务、设备能力、物力等情况，组织全市的国营、地方国营、公私合营、手工业之间的生产协作，尤其是要组织有材料而设备不足的企业和设备能力有余但缺材料的企业之间的协作。三，在全市范围内统一安排工业生产与基本建设材料。对于国家调拨的材料，要按照轻重缓急，进行必要的调剂；对于地方材料，统一分配，互通有无。同时，在原材料的使用上，要互相协作。四，逐步解决经济工作和其他工作方面的体制问题。
    目前，全市整风运动正在开展，各单位要本着整风生产两不误的方针，全面安排工作。通过整风，推动增产节约运动的开展。各级领导人要有步骤地解决在整风中发现的问题。同时要以整风的精神，教育全体干部克服盲目追求大规模、现代化、机械化、正规化等脱离实际的思想，真正树立起艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的优良作风。
