Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 25th: The Xin'an River Hydroelectric Power Station construction site is a hive of activity. Before August of last year, this was a desolate valley, but now it is filled with various auxiliary projects and residences for the builders. From Tongguan, the site of the hydroelectric station's dam, all the way to Lanxi Station, the starting point of the hydroelectric station's dedicated railway line, a hydroelectric construction force composed of more than 30,000 workers, railway soldiers, and farmers is creating conditions for large-scale water surface construction for the hydroelectric station along this hundred-plus li stretch.

　　The hydroelectric station's massive right bank cofferdam project will begin construction during this year's dry season. This tall wooden crib cofferdam, capable of blocking nearly two-thirds of the riverbed, is being built to construct the foundation of the hydroelectric station's right bank dam. Currently, the Second Construction Zone, responsible for the cofferdam project, is working intensively on construction preparations. Divers are conducting underwater surveys. Drilling rigs standing in the river are tirelessly extracting rock cores from the dam foundation day and night to further enrich the geological data of the dam foundation.

　　On the narrow construction site at the right bank dam head of the hydroelectric station, the stone excavation project is also progressing at a rate of thousands of cubic meters per day, with muck trucks shuttling back and forth like weavers. Along both banks of the Xin'an River, the two new roads carved by workers from the rocks for construction purposes have extended from the foot of the mountains to the mountainside.

　　The lifeline of external transportation for the hydroelectric station—the Lanxi-Tongguan Railway track laying project—will begin soon. After this railway is expected to be fully operational on October 1st of this year, it will transport thousands of tons of materials needed for the construction of the hydroelectric station every day.

　　The power generation capacity of the Xin'an River Hydroelectric Power Station is 580,000 kilowatts, second in scale only to the Sanmenxia Hydroelectric Power Station, and larger than China's famous Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station.

### 赛过丰满的新安江电站  百里工地一片繁忙景象

　　赛过丰满的新安江电站  百里工地一片繁忙景象
    新华社杭州25日电  新安江水力发电站工地上，到处是一片繁忙的景象。去年8月以前，这里还是一片荒凉的山谷，现在已为各项附属工程和建设者的住宅充满了。从水电站拦河坝工地铜官，一直到水电站铁路专用线的起点兰溪车站，在这一百多华里的沿线工区里，一支由三万多个工人、铁道兵和农民组成的水电建设队伍，正在为水电站大规模水面施工创造条件。
    水电站巨大的右岸围堰工程，在今年枯水期间，就要开始修筑。这个可以拦断近三分之二河床的高大的木笼围堰，是为建筑水电站拦河大坝的右岸基础而做的。目前，负责围堰工程的第二工区正在紧张地进行施工准备工作。潜水员们正在进行水下调查。矗立在江水中的钻探机正日夜不息地钻取坝基的岩芯，以便进一步充实大坝基础的地质资料。
    在水电站右岸坝头狭窄的工地上，开挖石方的工程也以一日千方的速度进展着，出碴的斗车像穿梭一样地来回奔驰。沿着新安江两岸，工人们从岩石中开辟的二条为施工用的新公路，已从山脚下向山腰延伸。
    水电站的对外交通命脉——兰（溪）铜（官）铁路的铺轨工程，很快就要开始。这条铁路预计在今年10月1日全线通车以后，每天将运进成千吨以上的为水电站建设所需的物资。
    新安江水电站的发电能力是五十八万瓩，规模仅次于三门峡水电站，比我国著名的丰满水电站还要大。
