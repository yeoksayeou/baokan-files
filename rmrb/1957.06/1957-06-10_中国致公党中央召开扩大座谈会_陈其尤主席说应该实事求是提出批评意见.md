The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party Holds Expanded Symposium
Chairman Chen Qiyou Says Criticism Should Be Based on Facts

    (Our newspaper reports) The Central Committee members of the China Zhi Gong Party in Beijing held an expanded symposium on the 8th of this month. Chairman Chen Qiyou, who presided over the meeting, said: Our assistance to the Chinese Communist Party in its rectification campaign should be based on factual criticism and suggestions, which is what Chairman Mao called “gentle breeze and mild rain,” starting from the desire for unity, and through criticism or struggle, achieving new unity. He repeatedly pointed out: It is not that our democratic parties have no shortcomings. If, while helping the Chinese Communist Party in its rectification, we also combine it with examining ourselves and correcting errors in our work, that would be good. Currently, the main task is to help the CCP in its rectification. We are convinced that the Communist Party is selfless and impartial, so there is no need to have any concerns when making suggestions.

    Huang Dingchen pointed out at the meeting: The core force leading our revolution is the Chinese Communist Party. To build a socialist society, this core team must have unified thinking. The "three evils" hinder socialist construction, so the Party must carry out rectification, which is what Chairman Mao said is like washing one's face frequently. Our assistance to the Communist Party in its rectification is also implementing the principle of mutual supervision. We can offer both positive and negative opinions to help the CCP in its rectification. We hope everyone will boldly criticize. Only by exposing contradictions can we resolve them. Dismantling the walls and filling the ditches will benefit socialist construction.

    Lu Xuxi suggested that all democratic parties should understand the specialized talents among their members and be responsible for clarifying the resumes of these individuals and introducing them to the leading party, so that the leading party can employ them according to their talents. Currently, some people hold too many positions and cannot attend to all of them, while others are left idle. For example, the director of the Guangzhou Municipal Counselor's Office holds more than ten positions concurrently, and does not even have time to meet with our counselors. We have raised our concerns with him, and he said that he is too busy and there is nothing he can do. Now, after so many movements, everyone's history has been basically clarified, so we can employ people according to their talents and not push everything onto one person.

    Based on his inspection of several cities in Guangxi, Lu Rongshu criticized the government for not paying enough attention to overseas Chinese affairs and for underestimating the significance of overseas Chinese work and the role of striving for overseas Chinese to serve socialism. He talked about the attitude towards "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and helping the CCP in its rectification: positive aspects can be discussed, and negative aspects can also be discussed. In Guangxi, there are situations where those who offer criticism or those who criticize less are labeled as opportunists or yes-men, which is not right. He believes that: you can speak out, and I may also offer counter-criticism. It's not that you are only allowed to say bad things about CCP members and not allowed to say good things. The purpose of debate is to distinguish right from wrong and correct mistakes. If only one side speaks out, it is impossible to distinguish the truth. Rectification and criticism are to help progress, not to strike blows.

    Situ Qing said at the meeting: In the early days of liberation, the United Front Work Department gave a lot of help to various democratic parties. However, since 1956, the assistance to democratic parties has greatly reduced, which is a major defect. I believe that the United Front Work Department should designate full-time personnel to frequently contact the cadres of various democratic parties who are in charge of actual work, and provide assistance in various aspects of work and thought.

    Zhao Huiping raised opinions on the wage system and personnel recruitment in his speech. He said that since there is a principle of remuneration according to work, all privileges under the guise of political treatment should be eliminated. He also expressed his views on the relationship between the Party and the government. He said that the phenomenon of the Party replacing the government is prevalent in many places, and the CCP Central Committee should be held responsible. The CCP Central Committee and internal departments directly issue orders on national administration and production work, resulting in lower-level Party members and Party organizations belittling the government, and the Party groups of institutions replacing the administration.

    Jin Dingxin said: When talking about the issue of walls and ditches, I disagree with some people's claim that CCP members should bear full responsibility. The formation of ditches and walls comes from both sides. The reasons for the formation, in addition to the well-known "three evils," are partly due to a lack of understanding of policies or the work of persuasion and explanation being insufficient. As democratic parties, we should reflect the opinions of the masses and represent the masses in making reasonable suggestions and criticisms. However, as far as our China Zhi Gong Party is concerned, we have done very little in this regard in the past. Over time, this has led to alienation and misunderstanding between the masses and the Party. Therefore, if there are ditches and walls between the members of the democratic parties and the masses and the CCP, the democratic parties themselves also bear a certain responsibility.

    Then, he criticized the Communist Party for not paying enough attention to the publicity work for democratic parties and for not providing enough assistance. He cited the Guangming Daily as an example, which is the only newspaper for all democratic parties, but its equipment is so poor that it is almost incomparable to other newspapers in Beijing. Now attention has begun to be paid to this and plans have been made to gradually improve it, which is certainly a good phenomenon, but it is hoped that the improvement can be faster; the democratic parties basically cannot obtain political propaganda guidelines and necessary propaganda materials for various periods. If they want to know, they can only understand it themselves from the newspapers. Under such circumstances, with the current conditions of our democratic parties, it is of course impossible to proactively, sensitively, and actively carry out publicity on the country's important policies. Because the political lines of our parties are consistent, therefore, it is impossible and should not be for the democratic parties to create their own set of propaganda guidelines. It should only be that the democratic parties carry out propaganda work according to the general guidelines and in combination with their own characteristics. From the People's Daily to local party newspapers, there are too few reports on the democratic parties.

    Finally, he put forward three suggestions on the work of cadres of democratic parties:
    1. Clarify the identity of the cadres of democratic parties. 2. Clarify whether members of democratic parties who want to join the Chinese Communist Party can do so and how. This will not only stabilize the working mood of the cadres of democratic parties, but also be conducive to the work of democratic parties in developing members. 3. I hope that the cadres of the United Front Work Department will actively make friends with the cadres of democratic parties.

    Ma Decheng, He Fengyu, and others also spoke at the symposium. Finally, Chairman Chen Qiyou announced that the symposium would continue.

### 中国致公党中央召开扩大座谈会  陈其尤主席说应该实事求是提出批评意见

    中国致公党中央召开扩大座谈会
    陈其尤主席说应该实事求是提出批评意见
    本报讯　中国致公党在京中央委员于本月8日召开了扩大座谈会。主持会议的陈其尤主席说：我们帮助中国共产党整风，应该是实事求是的批评提意见，就是毛主席说的“和风细雨”，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，达到新的团结。他还一再指出：并不是我们民主党派就没有缺点，如果在帮助中国共产党整风的同时，结合检查自己改正工作中的错误，也是好的，目前主要是帮助中共整风。我们确信共产党是大公无私，所以在提意见的时候不必有什么顾虑。
    黄鼎臣在会上指出：领导我们革命的核心力量是中国共产党，要建设社会主义社会，这核心队伍就要思想统一，“三大害”对社会主义建设，是有妨碍的，因此党必须要整风，也就是毛主席所说的要经常洗脸。我们帮助共产党整风，也就是贯彻互相监督这一方针。我们帮助中共整风，正面的意见反面的意见都可以提，希望大家大胆批评，只有揭露了矛盾，才可以解决矛盾，拆了墙、填了沟，才有利于社会主义建设。
    陆绪熙建议各民主党派应了解所属成员中的专门人才，负责把这些人的简历弄清楚，介绍给领导党，由领导党按才任用。现在有些人兼职甚多，顾此失彼，但有些人则被置闲。例如广州市参事室主任一人兼十多职，连和我们参事见面都没有时间，我们曾向他提意见，他说忙不过来，没有办法。现在经过这样多运动，各人的历史都基本弄清楚了，可量才任用，不必把什么都推到一人身上。
    陆榕树根据在广西几个城市视察的情况，批评政府对侨务工作重视不够，对华侨工作的意义、对争取海外华侨为社会主义服务的作用估计不足。他谈到对百家争鸣，帮助中共整风的态度，应是：正面的可以讲，反面的也可以讲。广西有这样情况，对分析情况提出批评，或批评少的人，便扣上投机分子、唯唯诺诺分子的帽子，这是不对的，他认为：你可以鸣，我也许可以提出反批评，不是只许说中共党员坏，不许说好。争鸣的目的，是分清是非，改正错误，如果单方面鸣，也分不清真理。整风批评，是帮助进步，不是打击。
    司徒擎在会上说：在解放初期，统战部曾给各民主党派很多帮助。可是，从1956年以后，对民主党派的帮助大大减少了，这是一个很大的缺陷。我认为统战部应该指定专职人员经常与各民主党派负实际工作的干部联系，在工作上、思想上多方给予帮助。
    赵惠平在发言中就工资制度、录用人员问题提出了意见。他说既有按劳取酬的原则，就应消灭以政治待遇为借口的一切特权。他还就党政关系问题发表了意见。他说很多地方都普遍存在以党代政的现象，中共中央要负责任的。中共中央及党内的部对国家行政、生产工作直接发号施令，造成下级党和下级党员轻视政府，机关党组代替行政的后果。
    金鼎新说：谈到墙和沟的问题，我不同意有些人说似乎应由中共党员负全责的说法。沟与墙的形成，是来自双方面的。形成的原因，除人所共知的“三大害”之外，有些是由于对政策的不了解或说服解释的工作做得不够而产生。作为民主党派来说，本应该反映群众的意见，代表群众提出合理的建议和批评，但以我们致公党而言，过去在这方面就做得很少，久而久之，便促使群众和党之间产生了隔阂和误会。所以说，若民主党派的成员和群众与中共之间有沟和墙，民主党派本身也有一定的责任。
    接着，他批评共产党对民主党派的宣传工作，重视不够，帮助不够。他以光明日报为例，这是各民主党派唯一的报纸，但其设备之差，几乎为北京各报社所不能比。现在对此已开始注意，并已计划逐步改善，这当然是好的现象，但希望能快一些改善；有关各个时期的政治宣传方针和必要的宣传材料，民主党派就基本无法得到。想要知道，也只好自己从报纸上去体会，在这种情况下，以我们各民主党派现有的条件，而要求主动、敏感、积极地进行有关国家的各项重要政策的宣传，当然就不可能了。因为我们各党派的政治路线是一致的，因此，不可能也不应该由民主党派自己另搞一套宣传方针，只应该是民主党派根据总的方针结合自己的特点，来进行宣传工作；由人民日报到各地党报，报道民主党派的消息太少。
    最后，他对民主党派的干部工作提出三点意见：
    一、明确民主党派干部的身份。二、明确民主党派成员要求加入中国共产党是否可以，办法如何，这不仅能安定民主党派干部的工作情绪，也将有利于民主党派发展成员的工作。三、希望统战部的干部主动和民主党派的干部交朋友。
    在座谈会上发言的还有马德诚、何凤玉等人。最后，由陈其尤主席宣布，座谈会将继续举行。
