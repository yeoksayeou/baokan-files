　　A Good Student Should First Be a Good Laborer
    Vietnamese Middle School Students Go to the Countryside to Produce

    Hanoi Dispatch: The Ministry of Education of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Labor Youth League have decided to strengthen labor education for young people. At a propaganda meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League on June 13, it was determined that all work of the Youth League in the second half of this year must center on educating members and young people in patriotism and labor perspectives. Students in Hanoi and other northern regions from higher primary schools upwards have successively begun studying the "New Labor Perspectives" teaching materials compiled and distributed by the Ministry of Education since June; staff members of central and local organizations have also combined the study of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's and Premier Pham Van Dong's May Day speeches and the resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party to examine their own labor perspectives. On June 9, young people from various organizations and schools in Hanoi held a voluntary labor activity, with a total of more than 2,200 young people participating in repairing the Hanoi Stadium. Prior to this, they had also held four voluntary labor activities to assist the government in the construction of the Hanoi Machine Factory and the An Luong working people's residential area. After studying, many young students have changed their past ideas of looking down on labor, believing that it is right to return to their hometown to participate in production after graduation, and that a good student should first be a good laborer. During this summer vacation, some students from the third-level (junior high) general schools and southern schools in Hanoi have voluntarily formed groups to go to the countryside to participate in production work.

　　好学生首先应是好劳动者
    越南中学生暑假去农村生产
    本报河内讯　越南民主共和国教育部和越南劳动青年团决定加强对青年的劳动教育。劳动青年团中央6月13日召开的宣传会议上确定，今年下半年青年团一切工作必须以向团员和青年进行爱国主义和劳动观点教育为中心。河内以及北方各地高小以上的学校学生，自六月份先后开始学习教育部编发的“新的劳动观点”的教材；中央和地方机关的工作人员也结合胡志明主席、范文同总理“五一”节讲话和越南劳动党第十二次中央全会决议的学习，检查自己的劳动观点。河内各机关、学校的青年们在6月9日举行了一次义务劳动，这一天共有二千二百多名青年参加修理河内运动场。在这以前，他们还举行过四次义务劳动，协助政府修建河内机器厂和安良劳动人民居住区的工作。许多青年学生经过学习后，改变了过去轻视劳动的思想，认为毕了业回乡参加生产是应该的，一个好学生首先应该是一个好的劳动者。今年暑假期间，河内第三级（初中）普通学校和南方学校一部分学生已自动成立了小组，到农村去参加生产工作。
