Raining Rally Against Atomic War
　　On May 25, in Sunagawa-cho, Tokyo, where a huge US air base is located, the Japanese public held a "General Mobilization Rally to Oppose the US Bringing Nuclear Weapons into Japan and Defend Sunagawa." In addition to local residents, workers, students, and representatives of many groups and political parties from all over Japan participated in the rally.
　　The rally took place in the rain, and the participants were extremely excited. The conference adopted a declaration of "Workers, peasants, students, and citizens should further unite closely to oppose atomic war preparations," and resolutions such as "Abolish the unequal Japan-US treaty" and "Oppose the United States bringing nuclear weapons into Japan." The conference also passed an urgent resolution demanding that the American soldier Gerard, who killed a Japanese farmer's wife, be handed over to the Japanese court for trial. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade in the rain on Goichishi Street, expressing their determination not to allow American soldiers to turn this street into a military base.

    冒雨集会反对原子战
    5月25日，在建有美国巨大空军基地的东京砂川町，日本公众举行了“反对美国把核子武器运入日本、保卫砂川总动员大会”。参加大会的除当地居民外，还有来自日本各地的工人、学生和许多团体、政党的代表。
    大会在雨中进行，与会群众情绪极为激昂。大会通过了“工人、农民、学生、市民进一步紧密团结起来反对原子战争准备”的宣言，和“取消日美不平等条约”、“反对美国把核子武器运入日本”等决议。大会还通过了要求把杀害日本农妇的美国兵哲腊德交给日本法院审判的紧急决议。会后，群众冒雨在五日市街道上举行示威游行，表示了决不让美国兵把这条街道变成军事基地的决心。
