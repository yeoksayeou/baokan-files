Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 22nd (Xinhua Reporter He Changhua, Zhou Li): Today, reporters at the Shanghai statistics department discovered a series of numbers. After calculation, these numbers interestingly illustrate that the value created by Shanghai's industry every minute is much higher than before the First Five-Year Plan.

	In the same minute of time, Shanghai could only produce a little over 130 kilograms of steel in 1952, but now it reaches more than 950 kilograms. In 1952, it could only weave a little over one meter of worsted wool fabric, but now it reaches 13 meters. In 1952, it could only make 53 pairs of rubber shoes, but now it reaches 126 pairs.

	Shanghai can now produce 32 bicycles and more than 14 tons of paper every hour. The tires produced every hour can equip three six-wheeled trucks. In 1952, it could only produce three and a half bicycles and a little over eight tons of paper every hour. The tires produced every hour were not even enough to equip one and a half trucks.

	The amount of penicillin Shanghai produces in just one day now exceeds the entire output of 1952 by a significant margin. A few years ago, Shanghai mainly repaired ships and radios. Now, a radio is made every four minutes, and a new ship can join the voyage every four days.

	The total industrial output value accumulated during the city's First Five-Year Plan can reach 50 billion yuan, an increase of 84% compared to 1952. Over the past five years, the average industrial output value per minute has been more than 19,000 yuan.

	Shanghai's industry has accumulated a large amount of capital for the country in recent years. The state-owned industrial sector alone, in the past four years, has submitted profits annually that could build a First Automobile Works for the country. The total basic construction investment the state has given to Shanghai's industry in the past four years is not even enough to build one First Automobile Works.

### 上海工业每分钟创造的价值

　　上海工业每分钟创造的价值
    据新华社上海22日电　新华社记者贺昌华、周立报道：今天，记者在上海统计部门发现了一连串的数字，这些数字经过演算以后，有趣地说明了当前上海工业每一分钟所创造的价值，比第一个五年计划以前要多得多。
    在同样的一分钟时间里，1952年上海只能炼出一百三十多公斤钢，现在已经达到九百五十多公斤；1952年只能织出一公尺多精纺毛织品，现在已经达到十三公尺；1952年只能做出五十三双胶鞋，现在已经达到一百二十六双。
    上海现在每一小时能够出产三十二辆自行车、十四吨多纸，每一小时出产的轮胎能够装备三辆六轮大卡车。而在1952年每一小时只能出产三辆半自行车、八吨多纸，每一小时出产的轮胎装备一辆半大卡车还不够。
    上海现在只要一天时间出产的青霉素，就比1952年全年的产量还要多出许多。几年以前，上海还主要是修理船只和收音机；现在每隔四分多钟就有一架收音机做好，每隔四天就有一艘新船可以参加航行。
    全市第一个五年计划期间累计的工业总产值可以达到五百亿元，今年比1952年增长84％。五年来，平均每一分钟的工业总产值是一万九千多元。
    上海工业几年来为国家积累了大量的资金。单是国营工业部分，在过去的四年中，平均每一年的上缴利润就可以给国家建设一个第一汽车制造厂；而国家给上海工业的全部基本建设投资，过去的四年加起来还不够建一个第一汽车厂。
