　　Vernacular Drama and Spoken Drama
　　Ma Yanxiang
    The Shanghai Vernacular Drama Touring Troupe's performance in the capital and meeting with fellow spoken drama troupes is a grand event in the big family of theater.
    Vernacular drama was born on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, at that time called "New Drama". Its form of expression was basically influenced by modern European drama, but in terms of creative methods (including scripts and performances), it inherited some traditions of our national opera. Therefore, although it is a Western spoken drama form, it also has a distinct national style. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, it connected with a broad audience in the Yangtze River basin and major cities with its progressive ideological content and easy-to-understand expression. It not only politically promoted democratic revolutionary ideas and attacked the dark rule of the Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlords, but also had an important influence on the formation and development of many brotherly drama forms (such as Shanghai Opera, Ningbo Opera, etc.) in terms of repertoire and artistic form; especially it sowed the seeds of spoken drama in many places across the country, and actually became a pioneer and trailblazer of the spoken drama movement in our country.
    The history of vernacular drama is not long. Even if calculated from the "New Drama" period performed by the "Spring Willow Society", it is only fifty years. But in these fifty years, the road it has traveled has been tortuous. It has had glorious and brilliant periods, and it has also had periods of decline and shrinking. After liberation, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" enabled many drama forms that had been neglected in the past and long since disappeared to be supported and developed. However, the fate of vernacular drama has not improved. Instead of developing, it continued to decline, and finally even its original form was eliminated.
    Why has vernacular drama been treated with indifference and discrimination from all sides for a long time? I think, in addition to some of its own shortcomings, one of the important reasons is probably related to the biased sectarianism in the literary and artistic circles and the theater circles. Not to mention that some literati and artists who were obsessed with Western drama during the "May Fourth" period once kicked vernacular drama away and completely negated it; even since liberation, as long as spoken drama is mentioned, many people believe that only the Stanislavski system is orthodox, and everything else is a heresy. Although vernacular drama is also called spoken drama, many people ignore its existence (the National Spoken Drama Festival last year did not include vernacular drama troupes) or deliberately squeeze it out of spoken drama (the National Drama Survey Form published in the first issue of "Drama Series" forcibly lists vernacular drama and spoken drama as two drama forms). These views are obviously wrong. Although vernacular drama still has some problems to be discussed in its artistic form, and it once went astray in its development process, which brought serious harm to vernacular drama, it did have a glorious history after all. In terms of art, whether from the creative methods of scripts or the form of performances, it has many characteristics that are significantly different from spoken drama. It is precisely because of these characteristics that the unique style and school of vernacular drama art are constituted, and it is precisely because of these characteristics that vernacular drama can become "vernacular" spoken drama. If we do not have sectarian prejudices in our artistic thinking, what reason do we have to exclude it and not allow it to have the opportunity to bloom under the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom"?
    Of course, artistic characteristics are not necessarily artistic advantages, and may even be artistic shortcomings. The question is how we understand these characteristics and how we change these shortcomings. Many comrades, after watching vernacular drama, almost unanimously praised its form of expression for inheriting the tradition of national opera and having a distinct national style, but at the same time, some people expressed doubt about its script creation method of using a scene outline system, believing that this method is only a transitional form and should be gradually abolished. They think that the performance of the scene outline system does not need a script at all, and it is entirely based on the actors' temporary improvisation on stage. This view obviously lacks understanding of the creative methods of vernacular drama. In fact, the scene outline system also has scripts (the dramas "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinating Ma" etc. performed by the Shanghai Vernacular Drama Troupe this time all have scripts and fixed lines), but this kind of script is not written by a playwright, but collectively created by the actors participating in the performance. The reason why vernacular drama is "vernacular", I think, lies in its unique creative method. If we negate the creative method of the scene outline system, we are actually negating the artistic characteristics of vernacular drama and negating the existence of vernacular drama.
    Chairman Mao clearly instructed us: "The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a policy for promoting the development of art and the progress of science, and a policy for promoting the prosperity of socialist culture in our country. Different forms and styles in art can develop freely, and different schools of thought in science can freely debate. We believe that using administrative power to forcibly promote one style and one school of thought and prohibit another style and another school of thought will be harmful to the development of art and science." In the season of letting a hundred flowers bloom, the two major schools of our spoken drama art have met in the capital. This is a great and inspiring event in the history of Chinese drama. May they learn from each other and help each other in this meeting, and from now on eliminate sectarianism, join hands, and work together for the advancement of our spoken drama cause and for the prosperity of our socialist culture.

### 通俗话剧和话剧

　　通俗话剧和话剧
　　马彦祥
    上海市通俗话剧巡回演出团来首都演出，同话剧的兄弟团体会见，是戏剧大家庭里的一件盛事。
    通俗话剧诞生于辛亥革命的前夜，当时称为“新剧”；它的表现形式基本上是受的欧洲近代剧（ModernDrama）的影响，但在创作方法（包括剧本和表演）上则是继承了我国民族戏曲的一些传统，因此它虽是西洋的话剧形式，同时却又具有鲜明的民族风格。在清末民初时，它以进步的思想内容和通俗易懂的表现形式，在长江流域一带以及各大城市联系了广大的观众。它不但在政治上宣传了民主主义的革命思想，攻击过清朝和北洋军阀的黑暗统治，在演出剧目和艺术形式上也对许多兄弟剧种（如沪剧、甬剧等）的形成和发展起了重要的影响；尤其是在全国很多地方撒下了话剧的种子，实际上成为我国话剧运动的拓荒者和开路人。
    通俗话剧的历史并不长，即使从“春柳社”所演的“新剧”时期算起，至今也不过五十年。但在这五十年间，它所走的道路是曲折的，它有过光辉灿烂的时期，也有过衰落萎缩的日子，解放后，“百花齐放”的方针使得许多过去一向不被重视的以及湮没已久的剧种都得到了扶植与发展，唯独通俗话剧的命运一直未见好转，不但没有得到发展，反而继续衰落下去，最后甚至连它原来的形式都消灭了。
    通俗话剧为什么长久以来遭到各方面的冷淡和歧视呢？我想，除了由于它本身的一些缺点之外，重要的原因之一恐怕是和文艺界、戏剧界的偏激的宗派主义思想有关的。不说“五四”时期的一些醉心于西洋戏剧的文艺家们曾经一脚把通俗话剧踢开，全部否定了它；即从解放以后，只要提到话剧，就有不少人认为只有斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系才是正宗，舍此而外，都是旁门左道。通俗话剧虽也称为话剧，可是就有不少人无视它的存在（去年全国话剧会演就没有通俗话剧团参加）或是有意将它挤出话剧之外（“戏剧论丛”第一期中所载全国剧种调查表就硬将通俗话剧和话剧列为两个剧种）。这些看法显然都是错误的。尽管通俗话剧在它的艺术形式上还存在着一些有待商榷的问题，而且在它发展过程中曾经一度走入歧途，给通俗话剧带来了严重的伤害，但它究竟有过一段光荣的历史。在艺术方面，无论从剧本的创作方法和演出形式来看，它都有着与话剧显著不同的许多特点，正是由于这些特点，构成了通俗话剧艺术上的独特风格和流派，也正是由于这些特点，使得通俗话剧所以能成为“通俗的”话剧。如果在我们的艺术思想上没有宗派的成见，我们有什么理由可以排斥它，不让它在“百花齐放”的方针下得到开放的机会呢？
    当然，艺术的特点并不等于都是艺术上的优点，甚至也可能正是艺术上的缺点。问题是在我们如何来理解这些特点，如何来改变这些缺点。许多同志在看了通俗话剧之后，对于它的表现形式继承了民族戏曲的传统，具有鲜明的民族风格这一点，几乎是一致赞美的，但同时也有人对于它的剧本创作方法采用幕表制却表示怀疑，认为这种方法只是一个过渡形式，应该逐步废除它。他们以为幕表制的演出是根本不需要剧本的，是完全靠演员在台上临时编拟的。这种看法显然是对于通俗话剧的创作方法缺乏理解。其实幕表制也是有剧本的（此次上海市通俗话剧团所演出的“张文祥刺马”等剧都是有剧本的，有固定台词的），不过这种剧本并不是由一个剧作家写出来，而是由参加演出的演员集体创作出来的。通俗话剧之所以“通俗”，我认为正在于它的这种独特的创作方法。如果否定幕表制的创作方法，实际上就是否定了通俗话剧艺术上的特点，否定了通俗话剧的存在。
    毛主席明确地指示我们：“百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。艺术上不同的形式和风格可以自由发展，科学上不同的学派可以自由争论。利用行政力量，强制推行一种风格，一种学派，禁止另一种风格，另一种学派，我们认为会有害于艺术和科学的发展。”在百花齐放的季节中，我们话剧艺术的两大流派在首都会见了，这是我国戏剧史上一件令人振奋的大喜事。但愿它们在这次会见中，互相学习，互相帮助，从此消灭门户之见，携起手来，共同为我国话剧事业的前进，为我国社会主义文化的繁荣而奋斗。
