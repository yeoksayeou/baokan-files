　　US Adventure Steps in South Korea
　　Liang Shu
    The United States' brazen tearing up of Item (d) of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a serious and adventurous step in its planned sabotage of the Korean armistice.

    According to Item (d) of this article, both sides should "cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea"; as for those weapons "destroyed or worn out during the armistice," they "may be replaced on a one-for-one basis of the same performance and same type," and the replacement should be subject to the supervision and inspection of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams.

    The importance of these provisions is self-evident. Article 13 of the agreement clearly states: This is to "ensure the stability of the military armistice, in order to facilitate the holding by both sides of political conferences of a higher level to achieve a peaceful settlement." That is to say, whether the armistice can be maintained and whether the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully depend on maintaining the existing level of military strength on both sides of the armistice.

    However, these provisions do not conform to the US plan to strengthen the military strength of South Korea and undermine the Korean armistice. On May 14, Dulles openly stated: "Replacing weapons on a completely identical basis is not practical, and there must be some flexibility here." On the same day, US Secretary of Defense Wilson interpreted Dulles' words as the United States "will make a decision soon" to transport weapons capable of launching atomic warheads to South Korea.

    The statement made by US representative Homer Leezenberg at the Military Armistice Commission meeting said: "Since a long time has passed since the implementation of the armistice, the equipment and weapons of the United Nations Command have become obsolete and outdated, and those equipment and weapons that need to be replaced cannot be replaced by existing or currently produced equipment and weapons." This also fully confirms that the US side is no longer satisfied with constantly violating the agreement since the armistice, importing a large number of weapons, and increasing its military strength in South Korea; now it wants to further turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare.

    In order to cover up this adventurous step of undermining the armistice agreement, the US representative once again played the consistent trick of falsely accusing the Korean-Chinese side of "violating Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement," and said that this made it necessary for the US to tear up this clause in order to "maintain a relative military balance." However, this despicable trick has long been bankrupt.

    The fact for more than three years is that the Korean-Chinese side has always abided by the provisions of these clauses. The US-issued memorandum slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "violating" the agreement is itself without factual basis. The memorandum stubbornly insisted that the reports repeatedly submitted by the Korean-Chinese side on the number of troop movements and equipment replacements in accordance with the agreement were untrustworthy, but it could not produce any tenable evidence. The US side especially dared not mention the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers had withdrawn more than a dozen divisions and their equipment from Korea, and that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had also reduced its army by 80,000 troops last May. The investigation and documents of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have also proved that the Korean-Chinese side has not violated the armistice agreement.

    On the contrary, the United States' violations of the agreement have been carried out step by step. Immediately after the armistice, the United States signed the so-called "ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group, and in the past three years, it has expanded the so-called "ROK army" from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. In order to enhance the US-Rhee military strength, the US side was found by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team to have transported a large number of combat materials to South Korea in the name of parts and disassembled parts within four months after the armistice. These parts and disassembled parts could at least be assembled into more than 5,000 machine guns, more than 200 howitzers, more than 140 mortars, and 37 jet combat aircraft. At the same time, according to the incomplete statistics of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team, the US side transported more than twelve different types and subtypes of combat aircraft, and even according to the report submitted by the US side to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, it transported more than ten different types and subtypes of combat aircraft.

    Since then, the US side has repeatedly requested to tamper with the armistice agreement so that the US side can legally transport weapons of different performance and types, even including aircraft equipped with destructive weapons. These requests were firmly opposed by the Korean-Chinese side.

    Another step taken by the US side to undermine the armistice agreement was the unilateral announcement in May last year to stop the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team in South Korea. Before this, the US side had always regarded the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as a thorn in its side, hindering and restricting its activities in many ways, and weakening its powers. For example, on January 21 and 22, 1954, the US side deprived the inspection team of the right to inspect at the port of Incheon. In July and August, it repeatedly instigated the Syngman Rhee group to hold large-scale "demonstrations" in Gangneung, Gunsan, Seoul and other places, threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and throwing bombs and shooting at members of the commission in Gunsan and Busan, while the US State Department spokesman expressed "a certain degree of sympathy" for this provocative action. If the United States really wants to "restore the relative military balance," why should it be so afraid and hostile to the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and insist on making it exist in name only, and now simply tear up the armistice agreement on the "guarantee of military armistice stability"?

    While tearing up this key clause of the armistice agreement, the United States hypocritically said that "the United Nations Command intends, as in the past, to fully comply with the ceasefire provisions of the armistice agreement." The British Foreign Office spokesman also echoed, saying that he "agreed with this action," but also said that this "does not involve the abolition of the armistice agreement." However, anyone who hopes that the Korean armistice can be maintained, thereby promoting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, can see the serious threat posed by this adventurous step by the US side to peace in Korea and the Far East. Nehru condemned the US decision to transport modern weapons to South Korea as "sowing the seeds of violence and discord."

    The Korean armistice must be maintained, and the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully. This is the common wish of the Korean-Chinese side and peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The Korean-Chinese side has been working hard to maintain the armistice agreement and strive to convene a conference of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and withdraw all foreign troops from Korea. This effort will certainly receive greater international support in the future.

　　美国在南朝鲜的冒险步骤
　　梁恕
    美国悍然撕毁朝鲜停战协定第二条第十三款卯项，是它蓄谋破坏朝鲜停战的一个严重的冒险步骤。
    根据这一条款的卯项规定，双方应“停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药”；至于“停战期间毁坏耗损的”这些武器，“得在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换”，而且替换时应受中立国监察委员会的视察小组的监督和视察。
    这些规定的重要性，不言而喻。协定第二条第十三款明白地写着：这是为了“保证军事停战的稳定，以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行来达到和平解决”。这就是说，停战能否保持，朝鲜问题能否和平解决，都有赖于停战双方军事力量维持现有水平。
    但是，这些规定不符合美方加强南朝鲜军事力量、破坏朝鲜停战的计划。5月14日，杜勒斯公然表示：“完全在相同的基础上替换武器是不实际的，这里必须有一定的弹性”。美国国防部长威尔逊在同一天把杜勒斯的话解释为美国“不久会作出决定”，把能发射原子弹头的武器运往南朝鲜。
    美方代表霍默·李曾堡在军事停战委员会会议上发表的声明说：“由于实行停战以来已经过了很长一段时间，联合国军的装备和武器已经陈旧和过时，那些需要更换的装备和武器不能用现有的或目前正在生产的装备和武器来代替”。这也完全证实了，美方已经不能满足于停战以来不断违反协定，大量运入武器，增加在南朝鲜的军事力量；现在它要进一步把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地了。
    美方代表为了掩饰破坏停战协定的这个冒险步骤，再次玩弄一贯手法，反诬朝中方面“破坏停战协定第二条第十三款”，并说什么这使美方有必要撕毁这一条款，“维持相对的军事平衡”。但是，这卑鄙手法早已破产了。
    三年多来的事实是：朝中方面一直遵守这些条款的规定。美方发表的诬蔑朝中方面“违反”协定的备忘录本身，就是没有事实根据的。备忘录硬说朝中方面一再提出的按照协定调动军队和更换军备的次数的报告不可信，但又举不出任何站得住脚的证据来。美方尤其不敢提一下中国人民志愿军已从朝鲜撤出十几个师和它的装备，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国也曾在去年5月裁减八万军队的事实。中立国监察委员会调查和文件也证明过朝中方面并无违反停战协定的行为。
    相反地，美国违反协定的行为却是一个步骤接着又一个步骤地进行。美国在刚停战后就同李承晚集团签订了所谓“韩美共同防御条约”，三年多来把南朝鲜的所谓“国军”从停战时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师。为了增强美李军事力量，美国在停战后四个多月中，就被中立国视察小组查获它曾以零件和拆散件为名运入南朝鲜大批作战物资。这些零件和拆散件至少可以装配成机枪五千多挺、榴弹炮二百多门、迫击炮一百四十多门、喷气式作战飞机三十七架。同一时间根据中立国视察小组的不完全统计，美方多运入了十二种不同类型和副型的作战飞机、甚至即使根据美方自己向中立国监察委员会提出的报告也多运入了十种不同类型和副型的作战飞机。
    自那时起，美方曾一再要求篡改停战协定，以便美方能合法地运入不同性能和类型的武器，甚至包括装备毁灭性武器的飞机在内。这些要求受到了朝中方面的坚决反对。
    美方破坏停战协定的另一步骤，是去年5月片面宣布停止中立国视察小组在南朝鲜的工作。在这以前，美方一直就把中立国监察委员会视为眼中钉，多方妨碍和限制它的活动，削弱它的职权。例如，在1954年1月21日和22日，美方曾剥夺视察小组在仁川港口视察的权利，7、8月份更连续指使李承晚集团在江陵、群山、汉城等地举行大规模的“示威游行”，威胁中立国监察委员会，并在群山、釜山向委员会成员投掷炸弹和开枪射击，而美国国务院发言人竟表示对这种挑衅行动“怀有一定程度的同情”。美国如果真的是想使“相对的军事平衡得到恢复”，又为什么要这样害怕和敌视中立国监察委员会的工作，非使之名存实亡不可，而且现在却根本撕毁停战协定关于“保证军事停战稳定”的条款呢？
    美国在撕毁停战协定这个关键性的条款时，假惺惺地说什么“联合国军司令部打算像过去一样完全遵守停战协定的停火规定”。英国外交部发言人也竟随声附和，表示“同意这一行动”，却又说这“并不涉及废除停战协定的问题”。但是，凡是希望朝鲜停战得以保持，从而促成朝鲜问题和平解决的人，都能看到美方这一冒险步骤对朝鲜和远东和平的严重威胁。尼赫鲁就斥责了美国决定把现代武器运到南朝鲜去的决定，“将散布暴力和不和的种子”。
    朝鲜的停战必须保持，朝鲜问题应得到和平解决，这是朝中方面和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同愿望。朝中方面一直努力维护停战协定，并争取召开有关国家会议和平解决朝鲜问题，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。这个努力，今后一定能够得到国际上更大的支持。
