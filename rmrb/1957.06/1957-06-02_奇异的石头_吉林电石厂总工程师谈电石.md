    Strange Stone
    --The Chief Engineer of Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant Talks About Calcium Carbide

    One of the key projects of China's First Five-Year Plan, the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, began trial production of calcium carbide on May 30. What exactly is the calcium carbide produced by this factory used for? To answer this question, the reporter interviewed Jiang Fuheng, the chief engineer of the factory. He first told us the following story:

    Several years ago, a floating dock was towed from the Netherlands to Singapore. During the voyage, the sea was swept by fierce winds. The captain and crew had towed docks across the ocean many times before, but this time they felt particularly uneasy. Pointing to the artificial fiber ropes attached to the dock, they cursed, "This thing is not steel cable, nor is it the Manila rope we usually use. Can a rope woven from thread used to make socks, and even half as thin as Manila rope, withstand such a storm!" Until the end of the voyage, they remained anxious. This is the story of the first time a cable made of artificial fibers was used at sea.

    Several years later, because this kind of cable does not absorb water, does not mold or rot, and is stronger than steel cable and Manila rope, some countries have widely used it to tow ships and moor vessels. Perhaps some people have seen the skydiving scenes in the film "Soviet Aviation Day." Like those colorful parachutes and the ropes on the parachutists, they are now also woven from artificial fibers in some countries.

    Artificial fibers can also be used to make tire cords for airplanes and automobile tires. Recently, nylon stockings, nylon silk, and other items displayed in department stores in our country are also woven from artificial fibers. Countries such as the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic now produce large quantities of artificial fibers every year to replace industrial raw materials such as silk and cotton yarn. They make thousands upon thousands of industrial and daily necessities from artificial fibers.

    "Where do artificial fibers come from?" Jiang Fuheng, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, continued, "You have seen calcium carbide used for lighting lamps at roadside stalls at night, right? Synthetic fibers are made from calcium carbide as a raw material through chemical processing."

    So, where does calcium carbide come from?

    The chemical name of calcium carbide is calcium carbide. It is formed by the combination of lime and coke in an electric furnace. Because it is synthesized in an electric furnace and is as hard as stone, it is generally called calcium carbide. The chief engineer said that calcium carbide is a strange stone, and it is a basic raw material with a special status in the organic synthetic chemical industry. In addition to synthesizing artificial fibers, calcium carbide can also be used to synthesize plastics, rubber, acetic acid, paints, solvents, dyes, artificial leather, shatterproof glass, and other organic synthetic products. Therefore, people call calcium carbide the "mother of the organic synthetic chemical industry." Modern chemists even have a bold saying: "Give me calcium carbide, and I can make everything."

    Calcium carbide can be used to make plastics. Plastics are no longer unfamiliar to the people of our country. From radios, handbags, telephones, film, toys, records, and other items seen in daily life, to airplanes, automobiles, ships, submarines, and other machines, there are various parts made of plastic instead of metal. Soviet jet airliners have doors, tables, and cupboards made of plastic. In the Soviet Union, there are more than two thousand kinds of plastic products. According to statistics, the world's plastic production in 1955 was more than three million tons. Except for aluminum, it is greater than the output of copper, lead, zinc, and other non-ferrous metals.

    Calcium carbide can also be used to synthesize synthetic rubber. Rubber is an important material in industry. Various rubber shoes, raincoats, sports equipment, insulation layers of wires, etc., that people come into contact with in daily life are all rubber products. Conveyor belts, transmission belts, rubber pipes, rubber sheets, linings on machines, gaskets, etc., used in industry are also often made of rubber. Airplanes, ships, and automobiles also require parts made of rubber. In particular, the tires of cars require the most rubber.

    Calcium cyanamide, made from calcium carbide, is a valuable raw material in the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, pulse drugs and aspirin, etc., synthesized from calcium cyanamide, have protected the health of countless people. Calcium cyanamide also has an interesting use in agriculture: scattering it in cotton fields can cause all the leaves on the cotton branches to fall off, and then machines can be used to pick the cotton bolls remaining on the branches.

    After the chief engineer introduced several major uses of calcium carbide to us, he said: "The construction of the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant is a good start for China's organic synthetic chemical industry. In recent years, the technology of the organic synthetic industry has been changing rapidly. We will learn the advanced technologies of the Soviet Union and other countries, and continuously manufacture various organic synthetic products from simple and cheap raw materials – lime and coke – to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives."

    奇异的石头
    ——吉林电石厂总工程师谈电石
    新华社记者　康国志、陈苡珠
    我国第一个五年计划的重点工程之一——吉林电石厂，5月30日开始试生产电石了。这个厂生产的电石到底是做什么用的呢？记者为了这个问题访问了工厂的总工程师姜福恒。他首先给我们讲了这么一个故事：
    几年以前，有一只浮动的船坞从荷兰被拖到新加坡去。在航行途中，海面狂风大作。船长和船员们在海洋上拖运船坞已经不是第一次了，但是他们这一次却特别感到不安。他们指着系在船坞上的人造纤维织成的缆索骂道：“这玩儿不是钢索，又不是我们常用的马尼拉麻绳，用这种织袜子的线编成的缆索，而且还比马尼拉麻绳细一半，能够经得起这样的狂风大浪吗！”一直到航程终了，他们心里还是七上八下。这是用人造纤维织成的缆索第一次在海洋上应用的故事。
    几年以后的今天，由于这种缆索不吸水分，不霉不烂，坚固程度胜过钢索、麻绳，有些国家已经广泛地用它来拖曳船舶和系留船只了。也许有人在“苏联航空节”影片中已经看到跳伞的镜头吧。像那些五彩缤纷的降落伞和在跳伞员身上的绳索，现在在有些国家中也是用人造纤维编织的。
  　人造纤维还可以用来制造飞机和汽车轮胎内的帘布层。近来在我国百货商店陈列着的尼龙丝袜、尼龙绸等也都是用人造纤维纺织出来的。苏联、德意志民主共和国等国家现在每年都生产大量人造纤维来代替蚕丝、棉纱等工业原料。他们用人造纤维做出的工业用品和日用品多到几千几万种。
    “人造纤维是从哪里来的呢？”吉林电石厂副厂长兼总工程师姜福恒接着说，“你们见过夜间街头巷尾小摊上点灯用的电石吧，合成纤维就是利用电石作原料经过化学处理做出来的。”
    那么电石又是从哪里来的呢？
    电石在化学上的名称是碳化钙。它是由石灰和焦炭在电炉里化合生成的。因为它是在电炉里合成的，并且像石头一样坚硬，所以一般人把它叫做电石。总工程师说，电石是一种奇异的石头，它在有机合成化学工业中是一种具有特殊地位的基本原料。用电石除了可以合成人造纤维以外，还可以合成塑料，橡胶、醋酸、油漆、溶剂、染料、人造皮革、不碎玻璃等等有机合成产品，所以人们把电石称为“有机合成化学工业之母”。近代化学家们还有一句豪语：“给我电石，我就能做出一切。”
    用电石可以做出塑料。塑料对我国人民已经不是陌生的了。从日常生活中见到的收音机、手提包、电话、电影胶片、玩具、唱片等等物品，直到飞机、汽车、轮船、潜水艇和其他机器，都有用塑料代替金属作成的各种零件。苏联喷气式客机上就有用塑料做成的门、桌子和餐具橱。在苏联，塑料制品已有二千种以上。据统计，1955年全世界塑料产量在三百万吨以上。除铝以外，它比铜、铅、锌等每一种有色金属的产量都大。
    电石也可以合成人造橡胶。橡胶是工业上的重要材料。人们日常生活中接触到的各种胶鞋、雨衣、运动器具、电线的绝缘包层等等都是橡胶制品。工业上用的运输带、传送带、胶管、胶板、机器上的衬里、垫料等等也常常用橡胶来制造。飞机、轮船、汽车上也都要用橡胶制成的零件。特别是车轮的轮胎需要的橡胶最多。
    用电石做出的氰胺化钙，是医药工业上的一种贵重原料。近年来，用氰胺化钙合成的脉类药品和阿司匹林等药品不知道保障了多少人的健康。氰胺化钙在农业上还有一种有趣的用途：把它撒在棉田中，可以使棉枝上的叶子全部脱落，然后用机器去采摘留在枝头的棉桃。
  　总工程师向我们介绍了电石的几种主要用途后说：“吉林电石厂的建设，是我国有机合成化学工业良好的开端。近年来有机合成工业的技术日新月异，我们将学习苏联和其他国家的先进技术，用简单而便宜的原料——石灰和焦炭不断地制造出各种有机合成产品，来满足工农业生产和人民生活的需要。”
