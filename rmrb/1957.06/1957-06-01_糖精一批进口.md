    Import of a Batch of Saccharin
    The Municipal Services Department recently imported a batch of saccharin from abroad through foreign trade departments to meet the needs of cold drinks, daily-use industries, and some pastry foods in large and medium-sized cities during the summer. The 5,000 kilograms of saccharin currently shipped to the ports of Shanghai and Guangzhou have been allocated to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi and other places for supply; another 20,000 kilograms of saccharin will be shipped to the port of Tianjin before the beginning of this month and allocated to 20 provinces and cities for supply; in addition, a portion will be imported in the third quarter of this year. The total amount of saccharin imported in this batch is equivalent to the supply of tens of thousands of tons of sugar. ·Zhu Youren·

    糖精一批进口
    城市服务部最近通过对外贸易部门向国外进口糖精一批，供应大、中城市夏季冷饮和日用工业及一部分糕点食品的需要。目前运到上海、广州口岸的五千公斤糖精，已分拨给上海、江苏、湖北、江西等地供应；另有二万公斤糖精，将于本月上旬以前运到天津口岸，并分拨给二十个省市供应；此外，还有一部分将在今年第三季度进口。这批糖精全部进口后，约相当于数万吨食糖的供应量。　·朱有仁·
