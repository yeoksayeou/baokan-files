　　Plans for Middle and Primary School Graduates Unable to Continue Their Education
    Various Regions Arrange Employment and Self-Study for Them

    (Our Dispatch) Currently, various provinces and cities are actively preparing to arrange employment and self-study for middle and primary school graduates unable to continue their education. Prior to this, various regions used diverse methods to conduct labor education and social propaganda work for students, and also organized special personnel to investigate the manpower needs of rural cooperatives, studying specific issues regarding arranging for middle and primary school graduates unable to continue their education to participate in agricultural production. The Hebei Provincial Department of Education also selected Baoding and Shijiazhuang cities to investigate the number of current graduating senior and junior middle school students residing in urban and rural areas, in order to prepare for future middle and primary school graduates unable to continue their education to participate in agricultural production. Some regions have also conducted investigations and preliminary arrangements regarding the number of people that urban service industries and handicrafts can accommodate, and how to organize students for self-study.

    This year, middle and primary school graduates unable to continue their education participating in agricultural production in rural areas is the main direction for employment. In order to accumulate experience in organizing students to go to the countryside for production, Wuhan organized nearly nine hundred self-study youth in three batches to participate in production in suburban agricultural cooperatives in mid-May this year. After the students went to the agricultural cooperatives, they ate, lived, and worked with the peasants. After repeated research, Wuhan selected four suburban cooperatives with relatively good conditions, and on June 18th, eighty-one self-study youth had already settled down in the countryside. In the process of organizing students to go to the countryside, propaganda was widely carried out to all self-study youth, student parents, etc., forming public opinion supporting students going to the countryside. Before going to the countryside, students and parents were also organized to visit the agricultural cooperatives they were going to, and the labor and life of the students going to the countryside were properly arranged, and specific problems were helped to be solved, truly achieving complete student voluntariness and parental consent. Shuishiying Township in Lushun City also made comprehensive arrangements for students who could not continue their education and returned to their hometowns for production. Some schools organized local soil investigation teams to investigate changes in the local soil. Each village in the township also established graduate work groups, adopting various forms to carry out in-depth publicity and explanation to parents. Many student parents have made specific plans for their children who cannot continue their education. The 17th Agricultural Cooperative of Lvcheng Township in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, made thorough arrangements for the return of current middle and primary school graduates to the cooperative for production. After the graduates return to the cooperative, the cooperative also plans to set up two self-study groups to help the returning youth improve their studies. Experienced farmers will be hired as their masters to teach them techniques such as transplanting seedlings, plowing fields, harrowing fields, and sowing seeds.

    For middle and primary school graduates who cannot find employment, various regions also advocate and rely on the masses and social organizations to run self-study groups, cram schools, and private schools to help students who cannot continue their education and employment to study. This year, Shanghai plans to change the past radio lectures into formal cultural radio schools to absorb more students to listen. In addition to continuing to hold radio lectures, Beijing is also preparing to organize self-studying students to participate in some labor activities to cultivate their labor habits and learn the ability to manage their own lives. The Hangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce has allocated 20,000 yuan for running schools.

### 为不能升学的中小学毕业生作打算  各地安排他们就业和自学

　　为不能升学的中小学毕业生作打算
    各地安排他们就业和自学
    本报讯　目前，各省市积极准备安排不能升学的中小学毕业生就业和自学。前一段时间，各地运用多种形式对学生进行劳动教育和社会宣传工作，并且组织专人到农村调查合作社需要用人的情况，研究安排不能升学的中小学毕业生参加农业生产的具体问题。河北省教育厅还选择了保定、石家庄两市，调查今年应届毕业的高、初中学生家居城市和农村的数字，为将来不能升学的中小学毕业生参加农业生产做好准备。某些地区对于城市服务行业、手工业可容纳的就业人数和如何组织学生自学问题，也作了调查和初步安排。
    今年不能升学的中小学毕业生到农村参加农业生产是就业的主要方向。武汉市为了积累组织学生下乡生产的经验，在今年5月中旬曾经组织将近九百名自学青年分三批到郊区农业合作社去参加生产。下乡学生到农业合作社以后，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。经过反复研究，武汉市选择了郊区四个条件较好的社，在6月18日，八十一名自学青年已经到农村落户。在组织学生下乡过程中，普遍地向所有的自学青年、学生家长等进行了宣传，形成支持学生下乡的舆论。下乡之前，又组织学生和家长到要去的农业社参观，并且妥善安排了下乡学生的劳动、生活，帮助下乡学生解决具体问题，真正做到了学生完全自愿，家长同意。旅顺市水师营乡对不能升学回乡生产的学生也做了全面安排。有的学校组织乡土考察队，考察乡土的变化。该乡各村还成立毕业生工作小组，采取多种形式向家长深入地进行宣传解释。许多学生家长都作了子女不能升学的具体打算。江苏省丹阳县吕城乡第十七农业社为应届中小学毕业生回社参加生产作了周到的安排。毕业生回到合作社以后，社里还计划办两个自学小组，帮助回社青年搞好学习，将聘请具有丰富经验的农民做他们的师傅，传授栽秧、耕田、耙田、播种等技术。
    对不能就业的中小学毕业生，各地还提倡和依靠群众和社会团体举办自学小组、补习班、民办中学等，帮助不能升学、就业的学生学习。上海今年准备将过去的广播讲座改为正式的文化广播学校，吸收更多的学生收听。北京市除了继续举办广播讲座以外，还准备组织自学的学生参加一些劳动活动，培养他们劳动的习惯，学会管理自己生活的能力。杭州市工商联已拨出二万元办学。
