The disarmament negotiations in London are a central issue in the current international situation. Since these negotiations began on March 18th of this year, they have recently entered an important stage due to the continuous promotion by the Soviet Union and the urging of international public opinion.

    The Soviet Union's New Proposals

    The Soviet Union is the main driving force behind the advancement of disarmament negotiations. The Soviet Union put forward constructive proposals for partial disarmament on April 30th, but no significant progress has been made due to the procrastination of the United States. In order to realize the desire of people of all countries to stop nuclear weapons explosions, the Soviet Union proposed a new suggestion on June 14th to temporarily halt nuclear weapons explosions within two to three years. In this proposal, the Soviet Union accepted the Western countries' viewpoint, stipulating the establishment of international supervision for the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. This removed the obstacles set by Western countries on this issue, thereby opening up the path to reaching an agreement.

    The Soviet Union's new proposal was warmly welcomed by public opinion in various countries. Public opinion in the United States, Britain, and France, as well as many members of parliament, also called on the governments of the three countries to carefully consider the Soviet Union's proposal and accept it as the first step towards achieving disarmament.

    Under the strong pressure of public opinion, the US government and representatives of other Western countries could not help but express welcome to the Soviet proposal. The US President, at a press conference on June 19th, acknowledged that the Soviet proposal was a "hopeful sign" and stated: "Very pleased to make some satisfactory arrangements for a temporary cessation of testing." British Foreign Secretary Lloyd even "unexpectedly" participated in the meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee, originally composed of representatives at the level of foreign ministers, on June 17th. At the meeting, he also acknowledged that the Soviet proposal was "an important step towards reaching an agreement on partial [disarmament] measures" and that disarmament negotiations had therefore reached an "important stage." At the same meeting, representatives from France and Canada made similar expressions regarding the Soviet proposal.

    Stopping nuclear weapons explosions is a major issue in current international politics and the most pressing demand of people of all countries. If an agreement can be reached on this issue, it can pave the way for achieving comprehensive disarmament. And once comprehensive disarmament is achieved, the world will enter a new era: a new era in which two different social systems truly practice peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. If Western countries, especially the United States, could truly seek a "satisfactory arrangement" to stop testing, as Eisenhower and others have said, this would have facilitated a smooth solution to the problem. However, certain forces in the United States are unwilling to do so. According to Western news agencies: Washington officials "do not indicate that the United States agrees" after "carefully studying the Soviet proposals". Because the implementation of the Soviet proposal would prevent the United States from completing its so-called final weapon - the intercontinental ballistic missile.

    What does this show? It shows that some forces in the United States are still keen on the policy of expanding atomic armaments.

    The Anti-Disarmament Forces in the United States

    While the Soviet Union is making unremitting efforts to achieve disarmament, the anti-disarmament forces in the United States are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine it.

    There are two factions within the US ruling group on the issue of disarmament. One faction advocates bargaining in disarmament negotiations to make arrangements that are favorable to the United States, in order to alleviate the strong domestic and international pressure that the United States is under. This faction is represented by Eisenhower and Stassen. The other faction opposes the above approach, believing that any prospect of reaching a disarmament agreement is very dangerous for the United States. This faction is represented by Radford. The result of the dispute between these two factions is that Eisenhower made a decision on US disarmament policy on May 25th. According to this decision, Stassen returned to London on May 27th and stated that he would "submit the US proposal to the [Disarmament] Subcommittee in the next few days."

    However, Stassen encountered new difficulties in London. Some North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries had disagreements with the United States on the issue of disarmament. As a result, Stassen repeatedly postponed the date on which he would present the US proposal. On the other hand, anti-disarmament forces in the United States, citing Stassen's informal bilateral talks with Soviet representatives in London, attacked Stassen in an attempt to disrupt the London negotiations. Under the clamor of anti-disarmament forces in the United States, Stassen was recalled to the United States for "further talks" with US Secretary of State Dulles.

    During his talks with Dulles, Stassen was said to have received a "reprimand" from his superior. Eisenhower also said at a press conference that some people thought Stassen was "running too fast." The Associated Press also revealed that Dulles had instructed Stassen to form a "united front" with the United States' allies in the negotiations. Needless to say, this was to deal with the Soviet Union. In addition, in order to monitor Stassen's activities, Dulles also added a senior advisor to provide Stassen with continuous "on-site guidance."

    Although, according to Stassen after returning to London, US policy was "fundamentally" the same as Eisenhower's decision on May 25th, the struggle within the US ruling group reflected the resurgence of anti-disarmament forces in the United States.

    Disagreements Between the United States and its Allies

    There are also disagreements between the United States and some of its Western European allies on the issue of disarmament. This divergence has become increasingly apparent recently. The United States and its main allies each harbor their own plans and calculations on the issue of disarmament, so their several hands cannot fit into the same sleeve.

    The main difference between the United States and Britain and France is on the issue of nuclear weapons. According to Western news agency reports, the United States, in order to continue to pursue its "policy of strength," refuses to prohibit the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, but advocates stopping the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons, and under this condition, it can consider limiting and stopping nuclear weapons testing. Why does the United States take this attitude? Because it has stockpiled enough fissile material, so after stopping the production of fissile materials for military purposes, it can continue to produce nuclear weapons. However, the situation in Britain and France is different. Although Britain has completed its hydrogen bomb test, it lacks the fissile material to produce such weapons. Therefore, Britain believes that the US plan would "endanger the entire British defense plan," that is, the plan to expand nuclear weapons. As for France, it does not yet have atomic weapons, and it believes that the US plan would exclude France from the ranks of countries possessing atomic weapons, so it also disagrees with the US approach.

    Not only that, but some forces within the British ruling group, like the anti-disarmament forces in the United States, are also afraid that any progress in disarmament negotiations will create a "new Geneva Conference-style atmosphere." Because this is quite unfavorable to Britain's attempt to gain benefits from the tense relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

    The Adenauer government of West Germany is a tool of the United States in disarmament negotiations. The United States attempts to use the ambiguous attitude of the Adenauer government to resist the proposal to establish an aerial inspection zone in Europe. However, Britain has taken a more realistic attitude on this issue. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated on June 12th that Britain "does not rule out the proposal to establish an aerial inspection zone in Europe." However, West Germany has consistently refused to express a clear attitude on this issue.

    On the one hand, the United States wants to control the production of nuclear weapons by its allies in order to maintain its hegemonic position. On the other hand, it is trying to exploit the differences between itself and its allies to strengthen its position in disarmament negotiations. United Press reporter Saxton could not help but reveal this US tactic. In a report, he said that France's attitude of refusing to ban nuclear weapons testing is "the West's most powerful bargaining chip"; and said that only if the Soviet Union makes "important concessions" can France's attitude be eased. This shows what kind of purpose the long-term "consultations" between the US representatives and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries on the issue of disarmament are pursuing.

    The United States is Under Pressure

    But in any case, it is already very difficult for the United States to continue to delay disarmament negotiations. Under pressure from domestic and international public opinion, US disarmament negotiator Stassen began to put forward some of the US disarmament plan's proposals at the meeting on June 20th. It is said that it will take Stassen several days to finish explaining the entire US disarmament plan.

    The part of the US disarmament plan that Stassen has already proposed only concerns the clauses on troop levels. In this regard, the United States agrees to reduce the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union to 2.5 million each without attaching any preconditions. At the same time, Stassen also said that if "progress is made in solving other political issues such as the German problem," the United States is also prepared to reduce armed forces to a level significantly lower than 2.5 million in two stages. Regarding the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing, Stassen said that unless progress is made in other aspects of disarmament, the United States is unwilling to stop nuclear testing as the Soviet Union requires.

    This situation shows that: First, the United States is not yet willing to immediately stop nuclear weapons testing; Second, the United States is making the "resolution of other political issues such as the German problem" a prerequisite for further reduction of armed forces, which is actually to block the path to further reduction of armed forces. From these two points of view, the US position on the issue of disarmament has not changed significantly from before.

    It is worth noting the situation and attitude of the United States on the issue of disarmament recently revealed by "U.S. News & World Report" magazine. The magazine said: "At home and abroad, people see that the United States is under pressure"; but "despite these pressures, changes in US policy will be limited." Therefore, the magazine said that if any agreement can be reached on the issue of disarmament, it will be "very slow to reach."

    It seems that there is still a considerable and tortuous struggle on the road to disarmament negotiations.

### 裁军谈判的曲折斗争

　　裁军谈判的曲折斗争
　　顾思
    在伦敦举行的裁军谈判，是当前国际局势中的中心问题。这个谈判从今年3月18日开始以来，由于苏联的不断推动和国际舆论的督促，最近已进入了一个重要的阶段。
　　苏联的新建议
    苏联是推动裁军谈判向前发展的主要动力。苏联在4月30日提出了局部裁军的建设性建议，但是由于美国的拖延一直未取得重大进展。苏联为了实现各国人民要求停止核武器爆炸的愿望，又于6月14日提出了在两三年内暂时停止核武器爆炸的新建议。在这个建议中，苏联接受了西方国家的观点，规定对暂时停止原子武器和氢武器的试验建立国际监督。这样就扫除了西方国家在这个问题上所设置下的障碍，从而打开了可以达成协议的道路。
    苏联的新建议得到了各国舆论的热烈欢迎。美、英、法三国的舆论和议会中的不少议员，也都要求三国的政府仔细考虑苏联的建议，并接受这个建议作为实现裁军的第一步。
    在舆论的强大压力下，美国政府和其他西方国家的代表，也不能不表示欢迎苏联的建议。美国总统在6月19日的记者招待会上，承认苏联的建议是一种“有希望的迹象”，并且表示：“非常高兴能作出暂时停止试验的某种令人满意的安排”。英国的外交大臣劳埃德，在6月17日甚至“出人意料”地参加了原由外交部长一级的代表组成的裁军小组委员会的会议。在会议上，他也承认苏联的建议是“达成关于局部（裁军）措施的协议的一个重要步骤”，而且裁军谈判因此已达到了一个“重要的阶段”。在同一天的会议上，法国和加拿大的代表也对苏联的建议作了类似的表示。
    停止核武器爆炸，这是当前国际政治中的重大问题，也是目前各国人民最迫切的要求。如果在这个问题上能够取得协议，就可以为实现全面的裁军铺平道路。而全面的裁军一旦实现，世界就将进入一个新时期：两个不同的社会体系真正实行和平共处、和平竞赛的新时期。西方国家，特别是美国，如果真正能够像艾森豪威尔等人所说的那样，寻求停止试验的“令人满意的安排”的话，这原会使这个问题得到顺利的解决。可是，美国的某些势力却不愿意这样做。据西方通讯社透露：华盛顿的官员们“对苏联建议进行的仔细研究并不表示美国同意”。因为，苏联建议的实现，将使美国不能继续完成所谓最后的武器——洲际弹道导弹。
    这说明了什么呢？说明美国某些势力依然热中于扩张原子军备的政策。
    美国的反裁军势力
    和苏联努力不懈地谋求实现裁军的同时，美国的反裁军势力却千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏。
    美国统治集团在裁军问题上，有两派主张。一派主张在裁军谈判中进行讨价还价，以作出有利于美国的安排，以缓和美国所受到的国内外的强大压力，这一派以艾森豪威尔和史塔生为代表；另一派则反对上述的作法，认为任何达成裁军协议的前景对于美国都是十分危险的，这一派以雷德福为代表。这两派的争执的结果是：艾森豪威尔在5月25日作出了关于美国裁军政策的决定。根据这一决定，史塔生于5月27日回到了伦敦，并表示要在“以后的几天内向（裁军）小组委员会提出”美国的建议。
    但是，史塔生在伦敦又遇到了新的困难。一些北大西洋集团国家在裁军问题上与美国发生了分歧。这样，史塔生就一再推迟他提出美国建议的日期。另一方面，美国的反裁军的势力又借口史塔生与苏联代表在伦敦进行了非正式的双方会谈，而对史塔生施行攻击，企图破坏伦敦谈判。在美国反裁军势力的叫嚷下，史塔生又被召回美国，与美国国务卿杜勒斯“作进一步的会谈”。
    史塔生在与杜勒斯的会谈中，据说受到了他的这位上司的“申斥”。艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上也说有人认为史塔生“跑得太快了”。美联社并透露说，杜勒斯已指示史塔生在谈判中必须与美国的盟国结成一个“统一战线”。不用说，这是为了对付苏联。此外，为了监视史塔生的活动，杜勒斯还加派了一个高级顾问，以便不断地给史塔生以“现场指导”。
    虽然，据史塔生回到伦敦之后表示：美国的政策“基本上”还跟艾森豪威尔在5月25日所作出的决定一样，但是，美国统治集团内部的这一场搏斗，却反映了美国的反裁军势力又在抬头。
　　美国与它的盟国的分歧
    在裁军问题上，美国同它的一些西欧盟国之间也存在着分歧。这种分歧最近已越来越表面化了。美国和它的主要盟国在裁军问题上都各抱鬼胎，各有打算，因此，它们的几只手就无法穿到一只袖子里。
    美国同英法之间的分歧，主要是在关于核子武器的问题上。据西方通讯社透露的消息，美国为了继续推行它的“实力政策”，拒绝禁止使用原子武器和氢武器，但是却主张停止为核武器生产裂变物质，并且在这个条件下可以考虑限制和停止核武器的爆炸试验。美国为什么采取这种态度呢？因为它已储备有足够的裂变物质，因此在停止用于军事目的的裂变物质的生产之后，它还可以继续生产核武器。但是，英法两国的情形却不同。英国虽然已经完成了它的氢弹试验，但是缺乏生产这种武器的裂变物质。因此，英国认为美国的计划会“危及英国整个防御计划”，也就是扩张核武器的计划。至于法国，它直到现在还没有原子武器，它认为美国的计划将把法国排斥在拥有原子武器的大国之外，因此它也不同意美国的做法。
    不但如此，英国统治集团的某些势力，同美国的反裁军势力一样，也害怕裁军谈判的任何进展会造成一种“新的日内瓦会议式的气氛”。因为，这对于英国企图在美苏的紧张关系中取得利益的做法，是相当不利的。
    西德的阿登纳政府是美国裁军谈判中的一个工具。美国企图利用阿登纳政府的暧昧态度，来抵制在欧洲建立空中视察区的主张。但是，在这个问题上，英国却采取了比较现实的态度。英国外交部的发言人在6月12日表示，英国“并不排斥在欧洲设立空中视察区的主张”。但是，西德却在这个问题上一直不肯表示明确的态度。
    美国一方面想在核武器的生产上控制它的盟国，以保持它的盟主地位，另一方面又竭力企图利用它同它的盟国间的分歧，来加强它在裁军谈判中的地位。合众社记者萨克斯顿就曾情不自禁地透露了美国的这种手法。他在一则报道中说：法国拒绝禁止核武器爆炸试验的态度，是“西方最有力的谈判资本”；并且说，只有苏联作出“重要的让步”，法国的态度才能缓和。由此可见，美国代表和北大西洋集团国家之间在裁军问题上所进行的长期“磋商”，是追求着一个什么样的目的。
　　美国正处在压力之下
    但是，不管怎样，美国想继续拖延裁军谈判已经是十分困难的了。在国内外舆论的压力下，美国裁军谈判代表史塔生已在6月20日的会议上，开始端出了美国裁军方案的一部分主张。据说，史塔生需要好几天的时间才能把美国的裁军方案全部说完。
    史塔生所已经提出的美国裁军方案的部分主张，仅只是关于军队水平的条款。在这方面，美国同意在不附加任何先决条件的情况下，把美国和苏联的武装部队各裁减到二百五十万人。同时，史塔生还表示，如果“在解决德国问题之类的其他政治问题方面取得进展的话”，美国还准备分两个阶段把武装部队裁减到大大低于二百五十万人的水平。对于停止核武器试验的问题，史塔生表示：除非在裁军的其他方面取得进展，美国不愿意像苏联要求的那样停止核试验。
    这种情况表明：一、美国还不肯立即停止核武器的试验；二、美国把“解决德国问题之类的其他政治问题”，作为进一步裁减武装部队的先决条件，这实际上就是要堵塞进一步裁减武装部队的道路。从这两点看来，美国在裁军问题上的立场并没有比从前有任何重大的改变。
    值得注意的是，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近所透露的美国在裁军问题上的处境和态度。这个杂志说：“在国内和国外，人们看到，美国正处在压力之下”；但是，“尽管有这些压力，美国在政策方面的改变将是有限度的”。因此，这个杂志说，在裁军问题上如果能达成什么协议，也要“很慢才能达到”。
    看来，在裁军谈判的道路上，还有着相当艰巨而曲折的斗争。
