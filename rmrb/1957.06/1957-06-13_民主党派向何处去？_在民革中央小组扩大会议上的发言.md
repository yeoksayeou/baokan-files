　　Where are the Democratic Parties Heading?
　　——Speech at an Enlarged Meeting of the Central Small Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK)——
　　Cheng Qian
    I just came from Hunan. In Hunan, I spent some time visiting factories and rural areas. Although it was a superficial and cursory observation, I gained a very profound impression. This impression can be summarized as follows:

      (1) Workers and peasants resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party;

      (2) Workers and peasants have a very firm belief in taking the socialist road, and they are working hard to build the socialist edifice;

      (3) There are many contradictions in factories and rural areas, but these are all contradictions among the people, or rather, issues of socialist distribution. As long as we act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on handling contradictions among the people, vigorously overcome bureaucracy, fully promote democracy, and strengthen political and ideological education, these contradictions can be eased.

    From the factories I have visited, the following problems currently exist: improving management level; fully promoting democracy by factory and mining enterprise leaders; raw material supply; apprentice upgrading; temporary workers; worker wages and bonuses; and employee family dormitories. In rural areas, there generally exist: contradictions between national plans and agricultural cooperative plans; contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and their members, that is, contradictions between the collective interests and individual interests of cooperative members; contradictions between cooperative members, and between cooperative members and individual farmers; contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and production teams; contradictions between cooperative cadres and cooperative members. Some of these problems and contradictions appear prominent and tense, while others are still latent and spreading, seemingly mild but actually quite acute. Our task is to face these problems and contradictions squarely, expose them, and handle them correctly, so as to further improve our industrial and agricultural production level.

    The CPC organizations in Hunan, in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, are carrying out a new rectification movement with the theme of correctly handling contradictions among the people, overcoming and correcting the erroneous ideological styles of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. In the rectification movement, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was implemented. The Communist Party listened to the suggestions, exhortations, criticisms, and accusations of non-Party members with extreme sincerity and humility, and exposed, examined, and improved simultaneously, showing a new outlook in its work. In late last month, the Third Plenary Session of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference was convened. More than 200 people made speeches at this meeting, and the Political Consultative Conference truly became a democratic forum for "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend." This meeting touched upon all aspects of politics, economy, culture, education, and ideology in the province. People expressed legitimate dissatisfaction with the losses and ill effects caused by bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and put forward bold, sharp, active, responsible, and realistic criticisms. I carefully studied these speeches, combined with what I have personally seen, heard, felt, and touched in the past eight years, and felt that most of the criticisms were indeed targeted at shortcomings and were good medicine for the Party. For example, the division of powers between Party and government, problems in the personnel system, political and ideological education within the Party, the proper arrangement of uprising personnel, the problem of unifying too much but not being able to unify effectively, etc., all require the Party to conduct thorough analysis and research in the rectification movement and take effective measures to solve them. Of course, in addition to the vast majority of positive and well-intentioned criticisms, there were also some "schadenfreude" noises and some shouts from right-wing elements. The Communist Party understands this, the people understand this, and upright and patriotic non-Party democratic人士 also understand this. Therefore, such noises and shouts are difficult to expand their market, and those who make noises and shouts are also difficult to capture the broad masses of intelligent people.

    The reason why I said so much about the situation in Hunan (in introducing the situation in Hunan, I actually included my criticisms of the work in Hunan) is partly because I have worked in Hunan for a long time and am relatively familiar with the situation; the second reason is to give everyone a general understanding of the situation in the province and the general ideological trends and political dynamics of the masses. I think such an understanding will be of some benefit to us.

    I have read in the newspapers the speeches of friends at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee for democratic parties and non-party democratic人士, the speeches of friends at the symposium convened for people in the industrial and commercial circles, the speeches of comrades at the enlarged meeting of the Central Small Group of our RCCK, and many opinions and articles published by people from all walks of life. I feel very encouraged and think that many comrades are putting the country first and the Party first, loyally serving the country and loyally loving the Party. I feel that most of the opinions truly start from the desire for unity and are good prescriptions for curing diseases and saving people. I also feel that, although some opinions seem somewhat extreme in attitude and somewhat sarcastic and slippery in language, they are indeed based on facts, and therefore should be taken seriously. I think the Communist Party will certainly have the generosity to accept these opinions and will not be demanding on the attitude and language. I also feel (not long ago, I only faintly smelled) that in the flower garden of a thousand reds and purples, a kind of noxious weed with concentrated venom has grown; on the prosperous democratic forum, there have appeared anti-Party and anti-socialist howls. I cannot agree with the latter situation, nor can I remain silent.

    In the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend," I would like to put forward some of my own views and ask for advice from comrades. Is the purpose of helping the Party in the rectification movement to improve the Party or to overthrow the Party?

    First, what is the purpose of the rectification movement? The CPC Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement stated that the rectification movement is for our Party and the working class to further and better lead the transformation of the whole society and the construction of the new society, to be able to better mobilize all positive forces, unite all who can be united, and transform negative forces into positive forces, and strive for the goal of building a great socialist country. This passage illustrates two points: one is to unite, to unite all who can contribute to the cause of socialism; the other is that the purpose is clear, that is, the purpose of the rectification movement is to better build socialism. Therefore, not starting from the desire for unity, or consciously undermining the unity of the people, acting cleverly and causing trouble among a certain part of the people, and creating rifts, violates the purpose of the rectification movement. Forgetting the great goal of socialism, attempting to reverse the train of history, and deviating from the socialist track also violates the purpose of the rectification movement. The Party sincerely asks non-Party members to help in the rectification movement, not to overthrow the Party, not to overthrow the unity of the people, and even less to overthrow the socialist cause that the people of the whole country have dreamed of. Therefore, when we help the Communist Party in the rectification movement, we must never forget this purpose. If someone unconsciously forgets this purpose, we should kindly remind him. If someone knowingly and deliberately goes against this purpose, wants to take advantage of the rectification movement, wants to stir up trouble, and wants to accumulate so-called "political capital," we must expose him and launch an uncompromising counterattack.

    Second, it is a historic initiative in the history of the Communist Party of China to carry out the rectification movement within the Party and rely on the strength of the Party and society. This shows that the Communist Party is open and aboveboard, has a broad mind, places itself in the bright light, and stands under the supervision of the masses. There are two grounds for launching non-Party members to help the Communist Party in the rectification movement: one is that it is possible, and the other is that it is necessary. Saying that it is possible means that non-Party members and people from all walks of life in society have improved in several years of actual struggle, have the ability to distinguish, have a certain sense of smell, can see the problems, and can put forward opinions. Saying that it is necessary means that the situation has changed, and opening the door for rectification is more effective and deeper than closing the door for rectification. If the Party has problems, it naturally relies mainly on the ideological struggle within the Communist Party, on the basic masses, and on the strength of the first alliance—the worker-peasant alliance—to cure this problem; but the Party can also rely on the second alliance, relying on a broader force to cure the problem. People say "internal and external attacks," I think that is what it means. But we must recognize that internal factors are the basic driving force for the progress of all things, and external factors are only the auxiliary force to promote the progress of things under certain conditions. Understanding this principle, we can better help the Communist Party in the rectification movement. A reckless doctor who throws medicine indiscriminately, a sober patient will not accept or appreciate it. On political leadership, one cannot take turns being the head of the household

    Third, is the leadership of the Communist Party needed? This was not originally a question. Whoever still raises such a question today, or attacks the Communist Party's leadership, only shows his political naivety and arrogance. Whoever wants to take advantage of the rectification movement to pull out a dagger and ambush the Communist Party's leadership is simply delirious and daydreaming. Not to mention the power of the Communist Party, not to mention that the Constitution stipulates the Communist Party's leadership over our national affairs, taking a step back, please tell me: if the leadership of the Communist Party is not needed, who will lead? We are currently implementing a multi-party coexistence system, with multiple parties jointly managing state affairs, but the nature of our regime is the dictatorship of the proletariat, and therefore it undeniably determines that the Communist Party is the core leading force. Our democratic parties all have a certain representativeness, representing the legitimate interests and legitimate demands of a certain group of people. Our participation in the formulation of national guidelines and policies, reflecting the interests and demands of this group of people, can prevent the country's policies and guidelines from being biased. Our RCCK represents former military and political personnel, and other democratic parties each represent a certain stratum of class. This is determined by the Chinese political and historical situation and the relationship of class forces. We only represent so much, and can only represent so much. We feel that our masses are quite large when we hold meetings here, but when we leave the meeting place, go to factories, and go to the countryside, we know that the scope we represent is ultimately limited. It is unimaginable for a political party representing a limited range of masses to lead all national affairs. Playing mahjong can take turns being the head of the household among four people, but political leadership cannot be done in this way. If we were to let our RCCK take the stage, may I ask: do we have the ability to mobilize the masses to carry out land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, agricultural collectivization, industrial construction, and the Constitution? It is definitely impossible. I say this only to clarify an objective fact: the Communist Party represents the highest interests of the entire people, and the democratic parties only represent the interests of a part of the people (the interests of this part of the people should be protected and respected). Who is bigger and who is smaller, who leads whom, this is an objective fact and cannot be determined by any subjective will. Shouting to abolish and weaken the leadership of the Communist Party, calling for Communists to "get off the sedan chair," wanting to kill Communists, and taking advantage of the rectification movement to squeeze the Communist Party off the stage are all just subjective fantasies, and will be bruised and battered in the face of objective reality.

　　The Chinese People Will Never Have a Way Out Without Socialism
    Fourth, is socialism needed? This was not originally a question either. If socialism is not needed, may I ask, is capitalism needed? If capitalism is not needed, and socialism is not needed, then where will China be led? The historical facts since the Xinhai Revolution have already given us the answer: without taking the socialist road, the Chinese people will never have a way out. Now the people of the whole country are marching confidently towards the broad road of socialism, and the Communist Party's rectification movement is also to overcome obstacles on the road of socialist progress. At this time, there are actually warriors rising up to try to overturn the case, fundamentally doubting the superiority of the socialist system, saying that the "three evils" are the product of the socialist system, the product of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and that to eliminate the "three evils," it is necessary to change the political system and abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. At first glance, this argument is indeed a bit funny; but considering it seriously, we can understand that this is a life-and-death class struggle on the ideological front. We must answer unequivocally that the socialist road is affirmed, and all words and actions that violate socialism are wrong. Long-term coexistence or short-term coexistence?

    Fifth, how should we understand "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision"? It should be said that whether to coexist for a long time or a short time depends on whether the democratic parties act in accordance with the socialist political foundation. If we act on this common political basis, we can coexist for a long time, otherwise it is not guaranteed. Birds of a feather flock together, and people are divided into groups. The Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party adhere to Chiang Kai-shek's treason and fascism, so they can only "coexist for a long time" with Chiang Kai-shek. The Communist Party treats us as friends and comrades. What kind of friend? A friend of socialism. What kind of comrade? A comrade of socialism. If we remove the common goal of socialism, or still want to dig at the foundation of socialism, then this is not a friend, nor a comrade, and of course there is no question of long-term coexistence at all. Furthermore, supervision. On what basis is supervision carried out? Is it to use capitalism to supervise socialism, or to use socialism to supervise socialism? If it is the former, then there is no supervision to speak of, and people will not buy your account, because this violates the laws of historical development. If it is the latter, then it is real supervision. Carrying out criticism, making suggestions, and helping the Communist Party in the rectification movement on the basis of socialism is a most powerful form of supervision. Just shouting for supervision without thinking about how to better help the Communist Party in the rectification movement is not a good phenomenon.

    On the Standards for Extensive Letting Go and Contention, and on Xue Jinlian's Military Assistant
    Sixth, is it to tighten or to loosen? "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy for a thousand years and ten thousand years, there is no such thing as tightening, but eternally loosening. I heard that some people are watching the Communist Party's drama, they are saying in secret: "Tighten up, the words have been spoken, tightening up suddenly will lose all popular support. Loosen up, it will be a mess, and no one knows where it will end. Neither tighten nor loosen, use guns to suppress it, and all popular support will be lost. Let's see what the Communist Party does? It looks like the wind and waves are high, and the Communist Party's ship is going to sink." In my opinion, these people's predictions are not accurate, because things are easy to handle, and the ship will not sink, it will not sink today, and it will never sink in the future. The Communist Party still wants to carry out the rectification movement and will always listen to the positive opinions of non-Party members; if evil winds and evil forces appear in the rectification movement, it will never shake the Communist Party's policy of extensive letting go and contention. Of course, extensive letting go and contention still needs a standard, and this standard should be: conducive to the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, conducive to socialist construction and socialist transformation, conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, conducive to correctly promoting democracy, and conducive to the unity of the socialist camp and the working people of the world. Within this standard, extensive letting go and contention is allowed. Beyond this norm, one can also "let go" and "contend," but one must let everyone "let go" and "contend," to clarify the truth and educate the masses. There is positive criticism, and there is also correct counter-criticism, this is the true letting go. In recent days, the People's Daily editorial came out, the workers spoke, and the great debate began, so some people rushed to tell each other that it was going to tighten up. In my opinion, those who say this are either unclear in their understanding and confused in their thinking, or have ulterior motives and are confusing the public. It should be said that after extensive letting go and contention, a great debate is necessary, which is a complete process of letting go. Now it is such a complete letting go, and it will still be such a complete letting go in the future. "Aunt and Sister-in-Law Heroes" is an interesting comedy. Xue Jinlian's military assistant, relying on the power of his master, said to Fan Lihua's military assistant: "I scold you, you are not allowed to answer back; I hit you, you are not allowed to fight back; I kill you, you are not allowed to bleed." This military assistant is indeed arrogant, but unfortunately the current world does not allow it.

    I have said so much, please criticize me.

    I also have a few words to say. We all respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen very much, therefore, we should faithfully and consistently implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's consistent policy of cooperation with the Communist Party. Many of us have opposed Chiang Kai-shek for decades, and finally had no way out. If we had not joined the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China one after another, where would the RCCK be today? Where would we be today? Sharing weal and woe, working together with one heart, being frank and sincere, and treating each other with sincerity are the most basic attitudes of every revolutionary Kuomintang member in cooperating and working with Communists under the leadership of the Communist Party. The rectification movement tests the Communist Party, and it also tests ourselves. The rectification movement improves the Communist Party, and it also improves ourselves. At a time when socialist ideology and non-socialist ideology are fighting, I hope that we will all stand firm, hold the line, and launch a struggle against our own and others' non-socialist ideology, and seek unity and progress in the struggle.

　　民主党派向何处去？
　　——在民革中央小组扩大会议上的发言——
　　程潜
    我刚从湖南来。在湖南，花了一些时间到工厂和农村看了一看，虽然是浮光掠影，走马观花，但也获得了一个极其深刻的印象。这个印象总起来说，就是：
      （一）工人、农民坚决拥护共产党的领导；
      （二）工人、农民走社会主义道路的信心十分坚定，他们正在以自己的艰苦劳动来为社会主义大厦砌砖铺瓦；
      （三）工厂和农村的矛盾很多，但这些都是属于人民内部的矛盾问题，或者说，是社会主义的分配问题。只要按照毛主席指示的处理人民内部矛盾的方针办事，大力克服官僚主义，充分发扬民主，加强政治思想教育，这些矛盾就可以缓和下去。
    从我到过的一些工厂来看，当前存在着下面一些问题：提高经营管理水平问题；厂矿企业领导充分发扬民主问题；原材料供应问题；学徒工升级问题；临时工问题；工人工资及奖金问题；职工家属宿舍问题。在农村大体上存在：国家计划同农业社计划之间的矛盾；农业社同社员的矛盾，也就是社员的集体利益同个人利益的矛盾；社员同社员、社员同单干农民之间的矛盾；农业社与生产队之间的矛盾；社干部同社员之间的矛盾。所有这些问题和矛盾，有的显得突出、紧张，有的还在潜伏滋蔓、貌似和缓而实际上也蛮尖锐。我们的任务是，正视这些问题和矛盾，揭露它，正确地处理它，把我们的工农业生产水平进一步提高。
    湖南的中共组织，按照中共中央的指示，正在开展以正确处理人民内部矛盾为主题的新的整风运动，克服和纠正官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的错误的思想作风。在整风运动中，贯彻了大“放”大“鸣”的方针，共产党极其诚恳谦虚地听取党外人士的建议、劝勉、批评和指责，并且边揭露，边检查，边改进，工作上出现了新的面貌。上月下旬召开了省政协第三次全体会议，在这次会议上作大会发言的达二百余人次，政协会议真正成了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的民主讲坛。这次会议接触到了全省政治、经济、文化、教育、思想各方面的问题，人们对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义所招致的损失和恶果表现了正当的不满，提出了大胆尖锐、积极负责、实事求是的批评。我仔细研究了一下这些发言，结合我自己八年来亲身所见所闻，所感所触，觉得大多数的批评的确是对缺点痛下针砭，对党来说是忠言良药。例如，党政职权的划分问题，人事制度上的问题，党内的政治思想教育问题，起义人员的适当安排问题，统得过多但又统不了的问题，等等，都需要党在整风中好好地进行分析研究，采取有效的办法来解决。当然，除了绝大多数积极、善意的批评外，也夹杂了一些“幸灾乐祸”的噪音，夹杂了一些来自右派分子的叫嚣，对于这些，共产党明白，人民明白，正派的、爱国的党外民主人士也明白，因此，这样的噪音和叫嚣很难扩张自己的市场，发噪音和叫嚣的人也很难得俘虏广大聪明的群众。
    我之所以说了这么多湖南的情况（在介绍湖南情况中实际上也包括了我对湖南工作的批评），原因之一是我长期在湖南工作，情况比较熟悉；原因之二则是想让大家轮廓地了解一下省里边的情况，了解一下群众的总的思想倾向和政治动态。我想，这样的了解对于我们多少会有一些好处。
    我从报纸上读到中共中央统战部召集民主党派和无党派民主人士座谈时各位朋友的发言，召集工商界人士座谈时各位朋友的发言，读到我们民革中央召开中央小组扩大会议时各位同志的发言，读到各方面人士发表的许多意见和文章。我感到很振奋，觉得很多同志都在以国家为重，以党为重，忠诚谋国，忠诚爱党。我觉得，绝大部分的意见是真正从团结的愿望出发的，是治病救人的良方。我也觉得，虽然有一部分意见从态度上来看有些偏激，从语言上来讲有些尖酸油滑，但所指所摘，确有所据，因此应该重视这些意见，我想共产党一定会有接受这些意见的雅量，不致对态度和语言有所苛求。我还觉得（在不久以前，我只是微微地嗅到），在千红万紫的花圃里，长出了一种毒液很浓的莠草；在繁荣的民主讲坛上，出现了反党、反社会主义的叫嚣。对于后一种情况，我不能苟同，也不能缄默无言。
    本着“齐放”、“争鸣”的精神，我想提出自己一些看法，向同志们求教。帮助党整风的目的是把党整好呢，还是把党整垮？
    第一、整风的目的何在？中共中央整风指示中说明，整风，是为了我们的党和工人阶级能够进一步地更好地领导全社会的改造和新社会的建设，要能够更好地调动一切积极力量，团结一切可能团结的人，并且将消极力量转化为积极力量，为着建设一个伟大的社会主义国家的目标而奋斗。这一段话说明两点：一点是要团结，只要能为社会主义事业尽力的人都要团结；另一点是目的性明确，就是说，整风的目的是为了更好地建设社会主义。因此，不从团结的愿望出发，或者有意识的破坏人民内部的团结，在人民内部的某一部分卖乖弄巧，惹是生非，制造裂痕，就违反了整风的目的。忘记了社会主义的伟大目标，妄图将历史的列车反向而行，脱离社会主义的轨道，也就违反了整风的目的。党诚恳地要求党外人士帮助整风，不是为了把党整垮，不是为了把人民内部的团结整垮，更不是把全国人民梦寐以求的社会主义事业整垮。因此，我们帮助共产党整风，时时刻刻不能忘记这个目的。有人不自觉地忘记了这个目的，我们就应当善意地提醒他。有人明知故犯地与这个目的背道而驰，想钻整风的空子，想兴风作浪，想积累所谓“政治资本”，我们就要揭露他，进行毫不调和的反击。
    第二，共产党开展党内的整风，借助于党外的、社会上的力量，这是中国共产党历史上的创举。这表明共产党光明磊落，胸怀坦荡，置身于光天化日之下，立于群众监督之中。发动党外人士帮助共产党整风有两个根据：一个是有此可能，另一个是有此需要。说有此可能，是说党外人士、社会上各方面人士在几年的实际斗争中已经有所提高，有辨别力，有一定的嗅觉，能看得出问题，能提得出意见。说有此需要，是说形势有了变化，打开门来整风比关起门来整风作用更大，收效更深。党有毛病，自然主要是依靠共产党内部的思想斗争，依靠基本群众，依靠第一个联盟——工农联盟的力量来治掉这个毛病；但党也可以依靠第二个联盟，依靠更广泛的力量来治掉毛病。人们说“内外夹攻”，我想就是这个意思。但必须认识，内因是一切事物进步的基本动力，外因只是在一定条件下促进事物进步的助力。明白这个道理，我们才能更好地帮助共产党整风。鲁莽的大夫乱投药石，清醒的患者是不会领教也不会领情的。论政治领导不能轮流做庄
    第三，要不要共产党领导？这本来不是一个问题。谁在今天还提出这样的问题，或者向共产党的领导权进攻，只表明他在政治上的幼稚无知和狂妄。谁如果想乘整风运动之机，掏出匕首，来向共产党的领导权打伏击，那简直是头脑发昏，想入非非。且不说共产党的强大，且不说宪法规定了共产党对我们国家事务的领导权，退一万步，请问：不要共产党领导，谁来领导？我们现时是实行多党共存制，多党共同来管理国家事务，但我们政权的性质是无产阶级专政，因此就无可置疑地决定了共产党是领导的核心力量。我们各民主党派都有一定的代表性，代表一定的群众的合理利益和正当要求，我们参预国家方针政策的制定，反映这一部分群众的利益和要求，就能够使国家的政策方针免于失之偏颇。我们民革代表旧军政人员，其它的民主党派各代表一定阶层阶级，这是中国政治历史形势和阶级力量对比关系决定了的。我们就代表这么多，也只能代表这么多。我们在这里开会，觉得自己的群众蛮多，但出了会场，下工厂，去农村，就知道自己代表的范围究属有限。一个代表有限范围群众的政党，要把全部国家事务领导起来，这是不可想像的事情。打麻将可以四人轮流做庄，政治领导断然不能如此。假如让我们民革登台，试问：我们有没有本事发动群众来搞土改，搞三反、五反，搞镇反，搞抗美援朝，搞农业合作化，搞工业建设，搞宪法？肯定地说是不行的。我这样说，只是把一个客观存在的事实讲清楚：共产党代表了全体人民的最高利益，各民主党派只代表一部分人的利益（这一部分人的利益应当受到保护和尊重）。谁大谁小，谁领导谁，这是一个客观存在，不是什么主观意志决定得了的。叫嚷要取消和削弱共产党的领导，喊共产党人“下轿”，要杀共产党人，趁整风之际要把共产党挤下台去，所有这些，都只是主观的幻想，在客观实际面前要碰得鼻青脸肿的。
　　中国人民离开社会主义永无出头之日
    第四，要不要社会主义？这本来也不是一个问题。不要社会主义，请问，是不是要资本主义？如果不要资本主义，又不要社会主义，那又把中国引向何处去？辛亥革命以来的历史事实已经给我们作了解答，不走社会主义的道路，中国人民永无出头之日。现在全国人民正信心百倍地奔向社会主义的坦途，共产党整风也是为了克服在社会主义前进道路上的障碍，就在这个时候，居然又有勇士们起来企图翻案，从根本上怀疑社会主义制度的优越性，说“三害”是社会主义制度的产物，是无产阶级专政的产物，要除“三害”，就要改变政治制度，取消无产阶级专政。乍听起来，这种论调，确实有些好笑；但严肃地考虑，就能理解这是思想战线上一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我们要斩钉截铁地回答，社会主义的道路是肯定了的，违反社会主义的一切言论和行动都是错误的。长期共存乎？短期共存乎？
    第五，“长期共存，互相监督”，究竟如何理解？应当说，要长期共存，还是要短期共存，决定于各民主党派是不是按照社会主义的政治基础办事。按这个共同的政治基础办事，就可以长期共存，否则就不保险。物以类聚，人以群分。青年党和民社党服膺蒋介石的卖国主义和法西斯主义，因此它就只能与蒋介石去“长期共存”。共产党把我们当朋友，把我们当同志。什么朋友？社会主义之友。同什么志？同社会主义之志。如果去掉了社会主义这一个共同目标，或者还要去挖社会主义的墙脚，这就不是朋友，也不是同志，当然也就根本谈不到长期共存了。再说监督。凭什么来监督？是用资本主义来监督社会主义，还是用社会主义来监督社会主义？如果是前者，那就谈不上监督，人家就不买你的账，因为这违反了历史的发展规律。如果是后者，那就是真正的监督。在社会主义的基础上展开批评，提意见，帮助共产党整风，这就是一种最有力的监督。空喊监督，而不好好思索应当如何更好地帮助共产党整风，这不是好现象。
    论大放大鸣的标准，兼论薛金莲的中军
    第六，是收，还是放？“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，是一千年、一万年的方针，无所谓收，而是永远地放。听说有人在看共产党的热闹，他们在暗地里说：“收吧，话说出去了，猛一收，失尽人心。放吧，搞得稀烂，不知伊于胡底。不收不放，用枪杆子镇压吧，也是失尽人心。看你共产党怎么办？看起来风浪高，共产党这条船要沉了。”照我看，这些人的八字算得不灵，因为事情很好办，船也不会沉，今天不会沉，将来也永远不会沉。共产党仍然要整风，永远要听取党外人士的积极的意见；整风运动中出现了歪风邪气，绝不会动摇共产党的大“放”大“鸣”的方针。当然，大“放”大“鸣”还是要有个标准，这个标准应当是：有利于全国各族人民的团结，有利于巩固共产党的领导，有利于社会主义建设和社会主义改造，有利于巩固人民民主专政，有利于正确地发扬民主，有利于社会主义阵营和全世界劳动人民的团结。在这个标准内，可以大“放”大“鸣”。越出了这个规范，也可以“放”，可以“鸣”，但要人家齐“放”争“鸣”，辨明真理，教育群众。有积极的批评，也有正确的反批评，这才是真正的放。最近几天，人民日报社论出来了，工人说话了，大争开始了，于是有人奔走相告，说是要收了。我看，说这种话的人不是由于认识不清，思想糊涂，就是别有用心，混淆视听。应当说，大“放”大“鸣”之后，必要大争，这才是一个放的完整的过程。现在是这样完整地放，尔后也还是这样完整地放。“姑嫂英雄”是一出有趣的喜剧，薛金莲的中军仗主子之势，对樊梨花的中军说：“我骂你，你不许回嘴；我打你，你不许回手；我杀你，你不许流血。”这位中军的确是够飞扬拔扈的，可惜现时的世界行不通了。
    我讲了这么大点，请同志们批评。
    我还讲几句话。我们大家都十分尊敬孙中山先生，因此，我们就应当忠实地、表里一致地执行孙中山先生一贯与共产党合作的政策。我们许多人反蒋反了几十年，最后无路可走，要不是先先后后参加了中国共产党领导的人民民主统一战线，民革哪有今天？我们哪有今天？风雨同舟，和衷共济，披肝沥胆，赤诚相见，是我们每一个革命的国民党人在共产党领导下和共产党人合作共事的最基本的态度。整风考验共产党，也考验我们自己。整风提高共产党，也提高我们自己。在社会主义思想和非社会主义思想进行斗争的时刻，我希望我们大家立定脚跟，压住阵角，向自己的和别人的非社会主义思想展开斗争，在斗争中求得团结和进步。
