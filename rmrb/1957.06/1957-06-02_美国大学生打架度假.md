    American College Students Fight on Holiday
    On the night of May 30th, two hundred American police officers used tear gas to disperse five thousand University of Illinois students engaged in a large-scale brawl on campus.
    Two female students were injured in the fighting.
    May 30th was Memorial Day in the United States. The students had nothing to do during the holiday, so initially, two groups of students organized water gun fights, and soon buckets replaced water guns. Then, it spread throughout the entire school, and all the students fought for more than eight hours. The school authorities finally had to call the police. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国大学生打架度假
    5月30日深夜里，二百名美国警察用催泪弹驱散了伊利诺斯大学五千学生在校园里的大殴斗。
    有二个女学生在殴斗中受伤。
    30日是美国的先烈纪念日，学生们在这个假日里闲来无事，开始是有两群学生组织起来进行水枪战，不久水桶代替了水枪。接着，蔓延到全校，全体学生混打了八个小时以上。学校当局最后不得不召唤警察来。（新华社）
