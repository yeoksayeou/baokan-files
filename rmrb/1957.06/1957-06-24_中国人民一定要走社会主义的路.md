    The Chinese People Must Take the Socialist Road
    By Bajin
    Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been published. This is a major event not only in China, but also in the whole world. The newspapers of our brother countries have reprinted it in full, and our friends are excited about it. Our enemies are confused and alarmed by it. Even American newspapers believe that "the West must study it carefully." In fact, no matter how they study and speculate, they will not understand the important meaning of this report. But they have to admit one fact: the position of the new China has been consolidated, and the confidence of the leaders of the new China has been strengthened. Even a month or two ago, American journalists had already made such a conclusion when commenting on the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement. Naturally, this conclusion was not to their liking.
    As for how the people of the whole country welcomed Chairman Mao's report with enthusiasm, this is also imaginable, and everyone can use vivid sentences to describe the touching examples of this kind that they have heard and seen. "People's Daily" said that the report boosted the enthusiasm of the people in the capital in the struggle against the rightists, which is a fact. We can also say that the report boosted the enthusiasm of the people across the country—not only the enthusiasm for carrying out the struggle against the rightists, but also the enthusiasm for building socialism. Carrying out the struggle against the rightists is precisely for the purpose of building socialism.
    In the past three months or so, we have often talked about Chairman Mao's report. Many people have listened to Chairman Mao's report and the recording and communication of the report, and some have even listened to it several times. But even if you have listened to it several times, it does not mean that everyone fully understands the meaning of the report. Because the content of the report is both deep and broad and comprehensive, the twelve questions include all the important issues at present, and not only raise the questions, but also put forward solutions to the problems. These all require careful understanding, repeated study, and conscientious learning. However, the situation is different now. In these three months or so, many things have happened that we did not expect, and these things have precisely confirmed what Chairman Mao said and annotated Chairman Mao's report. We are surprised that Chairman Mao had already seen so many things at that time, and saw them so clearly, as if he were a prophet. In fact, he just grasped and applied dialectics correctly. Therefore, when we reread Chairman Mao's report today, we will feel very cordial and get great encouragement. We seem to have found a compass or a weapon for self-defense. To give just one example, for example, to deal with poisonous weeds, we now have a grass-cutting knife or a weeding hoe.
    Some time ago, when everyone talked about the issue of fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds in "blooming" and "contending," some people were worried that they would not be able to distinguish what is a poisonous weed for a while. Now the facts prove that this worry is actually superfluous. Poisonous weeds have already emerged here and there. These poisonous weeds are still released mixed in with fragrant flowers, some "blooming" and "contending" particularly "big," some just "released" and shrinking back, and some are disguised in various ways. But no matter what "emerging tactics" they adopt, they immediately reveal their true colors once they appear. Even if they insert fake flowers of "helping the rectification," they cannot hide the conspiracy of careerists to usurp leadership and the intention of the exploiting classes to vainly attempt restoration. No one regards poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers, unless there is a resonance in terms of ideology and emotion first. As a common saying goes: "The people's eyes are discerning." Poisonous weeds cannot deceive the eyes of the people.
    On the contrary, the eyes of those rightists with ulterior motives are not discerning. They only see their personal interests. They actually regard today's "blooming" and "contending" situation as a pool of muddy water, wanting to catch big fish in it. They believe that the beginning of the Party's rectification is an opportunity for them to take advantage of, and they have successively thrown out the magic weapons in their hands, hoping to seize the fruits of the revolution in one fell swoop, change the situation in China, and divide the "world" as personal private property, and even class components can be used as goods for money. There are also those hypocrites who cannot do without "the common people" and are willing to let "the common people" return to the old society to suffer in order to satisfy their personal "freedom" of scolding.
    But all this is just the wishful thinking of a small group of people. These ideas will not have the slightest chance of being realized. Because "the common people" do not want them, and in the eyes of "the common people" they are "poisonous weeds."
    The rightists clamor not to have "Party leadership" for a very simple reason, because they want to take the capitalist road. Of course, taking the capitalist road cannot require the Communist Party to lead, the Communist Party will lead us to socialism and communism. But the Chinese people must take the socialist road. Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs in China shed their blood for socialism, and today there are also thousands upon thousands of revolutionary people who dedicate all their strength to building socialism. The Chinese people want to take the socialist road, because they know that only by taking this road can the poor and weak China become prosperous and strong, and only by taking this road can they bring happiness to themselves and their descendants. This view is very reasonable. Why can things that could not be done for a hundred years be done in a few years? Why can Chinese people who could not stand up for a hundred years suddenly stand up? In fact, today's Chinese people and our ancestors are the same hardworking and industrious people. The difference is that today we have the correct path and the correct leadership. In the past, without correct leadership, the Chinese people were always regarded by Westerners as "a heap of loose sand." Today, with correct leadership, the Chinese people have become a strong whole, and at least the strength of most people has been brought into play. Many Westerners do not understand this, so they have never been able to estimate the strength of the new China. The Americans only understood a little after hitting a snag in Korea. The rightists should understand more than the Americans, because they are Chinese. They close their eyes and clamor "do not want Party leadership," which is just their class stand at work. They do not want others to lead, just because they want to come out to lead themselves. But this is contrary to the interests and wishes of the Chinese people, and the real common people will not agree.
    Today no one opposes "big blooming" and "big contending." But "blooming" and "contending" should also have a purpose. Rectification is to do a good job, and "blooming" and "contending" are also to do a good job. All this is to better serve the construction of socialism. Poisonous weeds will hinder our work and hinder our construction. If anyone releases poisonous weeds in "blooming" and "contending," even if there is only one plant, we must pull it out and not let it grow. In our new society, poisonous weeds do not have the right to survive. Counter-criticism and drawing a clear line is a method of pulling weeds.
    Now is the time for the rightists to "rein in at the edge of the cliff." Continue to release poisonous weeds to harm people, or seriously study Chairman Mao's report and use those six political criteria to examine their own thoughts and admit their mistakes? Cut themselves off from the people, or bow their heads to the people?
    There is no third way in front of them.

    中国人民一定要走社会主义的路
    巴金
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告发表了。不仅在我们中国，甚至在全世界，这都是一件大事。我们的兄弟国家的报纸全文转载了它，我们的朋友为它感到兴奋。我们的敌人却因它而感到迷惑和惊惶。连美国的报纸也认为“西方必须加以缜密的研究”。其实不管他们作怎样的研究和揣测，他们是不会了解这篇报告的重要意义的。但是他们却不得不承认一件事实：新中国的地位巩固了，新中国领导者的信心加强了。甚至在前一两个月，美国的记者评论中国共产党整风的消息的时候就已经作过这样的论断了。自然这个论断并不是他们自己所喜欢的。
    至于全国人民怎样充满热情地欢迎毛主席的报告，这也是可以想像到的事，而且每个人都可以用生动的句子来描写他耳闻目睹的这一类动人的事例。“人民日报”说报告鼓舞了首都人民的反右派斗争的热情，这是事实。我们也可以说报告鼓舞了全国人民的热情——不仅是进行反右派的斗争的热情，而且是建设社会主义的热情。进行反右派的斗争，正是为了建设社会主义。
    最近三个多月来，我们常常谈论毛主席的这篇报告。很多人听过了毛主席的报告和报告的录音与传达，有的人甚至听过了几次。但是即使听过几次，也不见得大家全懂报告的意义。因为报告的内容是既深且广而且全面，十二个问题把目前所有的重要问题全包括进去了，不但提出了问题，同时也提出了解决问题的办法。这些都需要着细心的体会，反复的研究和认真的学习。然而现在情形不同了。这三个多月中间发生了许多我们没有料到的事情，这些事情恰恰证实了毛主席的话，而且给毛主席的报告作了注解。我们惊讶毛主席在那个时候就已经看到了这许多事情，而且看得这么清楚，好像他是个未卜先知的预言家。其实他也只是正确地掌握了，运用了辩证法。所以我们今天重读毛主席的报告，我们会感到非常亲切，而且也得到很大的鼓舞。我们好像找到了一个指南针或者一样防身的武器。随便举一个例，譬如对付毒草，我们现在就有了割草的刀或者除草的锄头。
    前些时候大家谈起“鸣”“放”中的香花与毒草的问题，还有人担心自己一时不能辨别什么是毒草。现在事实证明这种担心其实是多余的。毒草已经在这里那里冒出来了。这些毒草还是夹杂在香花中间放出来的，有的大“放”特“放”，有的刚刚“放”出来就缩回去，有的还披上了各种的伪装。但是不论它们采取什么样的“冒出来的战术”，它们一出现马上就露出了原形。即使它们插上“帮助整风”的假花，也掩藏不了野心家的篡夺领导权的阴谋和剥削阶级妄想复辟的居心。并没有人把毒草当作香花，除非在思想感情方面先有了共鸣。正如一句说惯了的老话：“人民的眼睛是雪亮的”。毒草瞒不过人民的眼睛。
    相反的，那些别有用心的右派分子的眼睛并不雪亮。他们就只看见他们个人的利益。他们居然把今天“鸣”“放”的局面看作一池浑水，想在那里面摸大鱼。他们认为党的整风开始就是他们可乘的时机，便接连抛出手中的法宝，希望一举攫取革命的果实，改变中国的局面，把“天下”当作个人的私产来一个大分家，连阶级成分也可以当作货物换钱。还有那些口口声声离不掉“老百姓”的伪君子为了满足个人的谩骂的“自由”，宁愿让
  “老百姓”回到旧社会去受苦。
    但是这一切都只是一小撮人的痴心妄想。这些想法连一点实现的机会也不会有。因为“老百姓”不要它们，在“老百姓”的眼睛里它们就是“毒草”。
    右派分子叫嚣不要“党的领导”，理由很简单，因为他们要走资本主义的路。走资本主义的路当然不能要共产党来领导，共产党会把我们领到社会主义和共产主义去。可是中国人民一定要走社会主义的路。中国千千万万的革命先烈为了社会主义流尽他们的鲜血，今天还有千千万万的革命志士为着建设社会主义献出他们的全部力量。中国人民要走社会主义的路，因为他们知道只有走这条路才能使贫弱的中国繁荣富强，只有走这条路才能给他们和他们的子孙带来幸福。这种看法是很合理的。为什么一百年来做不到的事在几年里面就做到了呢？为什么一百年来都站不起来的中国人一下子就站起来了呢？其实，今天的中国人和我们的祖先都是同样的刻苦勤劳的人民，不同的是今天我们有了正确的路和正确的领导。过去没有正确的领导，中国人一直被西方人认为“一盘散沙”。今天有了正确的领导，中国人成了一个坚强的整体，至少绝大部分人的力量都发挥出来了。许多西方人不了解这一点，因此始终不能估计新中国的力量，美国人在朝鲜碰了钉子以后才懂得了一点。右派分子应当比美国人懂得多些，因为他们是中国人。他们闭着眼睛叫嚣“不要党的领导”，这只是他们的阶级立场在作怪。他们不要别人领导，只是因为他们要自己出来领导。但这是违反中国人民的利益和愿望的事，真正的老百姓是不会答应的。
    今天并没有人反对大“鸣”大
  “放”。但是“鸣”“放”也应当有目的。整风是为了搞好工作，
  “鸣”“放”也是为了搞好工作。这都是为了更好地为社会主义的建设服务。毒草会妨害我们的工作，妨害我们的建设。要是谁在“鸣”
  “放”中放出了毒草，哪怕只有一株，我们也得把它拔掉，不能让它长大。在我们的新社会中毒草并没有生存的权利。反批评和划清界限就是一种拔草的方法。
    现在正是右派分子“悬崖勒马”的时候了。继续放出毒草来害人呢，还是认真学习毛主席的报告并且用那六条政治标准来检查自己的思想，承认自己的错误？自绝于人民呢，还是向人民低头？
    在他们的前面并没有第三条路。
