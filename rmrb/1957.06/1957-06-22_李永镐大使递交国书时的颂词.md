Ambassador Li Yong-ho's Speech Upon Presenting Credentials

I am honored to present to you the Letter of Credence from the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the People's Republic of China.

The Korean people, like their own achievements, are watching with boundless joy the brilliant achievements of their great neighbor, the People's Republic of China, in socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people during the First Five-Year Plan for socialist construction are not only a tremendous force for further strengthening the socialist camp closely united under the banner of proletarian internationalism, but also greatly encourage the people of Asia and Africa who are fighting against colonialism and for the independence of their motherlands, and the people who are fighting for lasting peace.

Due to its growing power and consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy, the People's Republic of China, together with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, has had a decisive influence in crushing the vicious conspiracies of imperialist aggressive forces, easing international tensions, and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

The Korean people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, highly appreciate the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to achieve the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence under different social systems.

Today, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have developed into an indelible vitality in international relations and are being widely applied.

We, the Korean people, warmly support the just struggle of the People's Republic of China for the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue, an inalienable part of its territory, and resolutely oppose and denounce the insidious policy of U.S. imperialism in Taiwan. The fraternal Chinese people continue to actively support the Korean people who are striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and are rising up to carry out socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic, and provide them with selfless and enormous assistance in material and technical aspects.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors, together with the Korean People's Army, inflicted fatal blows on the U.S. imperialist aggressors during the arduous Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people, and achieved a brilliant victory; thereafter, they defended the line of peace and actively helped the Korean people in peaceful construction.

The traditional friendship between our two peoples, which has been cemented with blood in the long-term common struggle against foreign aggressors, is being strengthened and developed day by day and has become a model of friendly unity among the people of the world.

The Korean people, closely united with the great family of fraternal socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, are crushing the U.S. imperialist policy of permanently dividing their motherland and turning their motherland into a U.S. imperialist colony, and are full of confidence in the early realization of the great cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The Korean people are deeply convinced that the Chinese people will consolidate and develop the victories they have achieved in the great cause of striving for the socialist industrialization of their country, and will achieve new victories in the cause of striving for a consolidated peace in Asia and the world.

Li Yong-ho said, respected Chairman: I assure you that in order to further develop the traditional friendly relations between the Korean and Chinese peoples, I will devote all my energy; I am deeply convinced that in completing this important task, I will receive the support and assistance of you, respected sir, and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    在光荣的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导下，兄弟的中国人民在建设社会主义的第一个五年计划期间取得的辉煌成就，对于进一步加强紧密团结在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下的社会主义阵营，不仅是巨大的力量，而且大大鼓舞了反对殖民主义、为自己祖国的独立而斗争的亚非各国人民和为持久和平而斗争的人民。
    由于威力的壮大和一贯实行和平的对外政策，中华人民共和国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家一道，在粉碎帝国主义侵略势力的凶恶阴谋、缓和国际紧张局势和巩固亚洲和世界和平方面，产生了决定性的影响。
    朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起，对于中华人民共和国争取在不同社会制度下实现和平共处五项原则方面所作的努力，给予高度的评价。

    我们朝鲜人民热烈支持中华人民共和国为和平解决自己领土不可分割的一部分——台湾问题而作的正当斗争，并且坚决反对和抨击美帝国主义在台湾的阴险政策。兄弟的中国人民正继续积极支援为和平统一祖国和奋起在共和国北半部进行社会主义建设的朝鲜人民，并在物质和技术方面给予他们无私的巨大援助。
    英勇的中国人民志愿军勇士，在朝鲜人民严峻的祖国解放战争时期，同朝鲜人民军一起，给予美帝国主义侵略者以致命的打击，取得了光辉的胜利；此后，又坚守着和平的防线，积极帮助朝鲜人民进行和平建设。
    长期以来在反对外来侵略者的共同斗争中用鲜血凝成的我们两国人民之间的传统的友好关系正在日益加强和发展，并且成为全世界人民友好团结的典范。
    同以伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为首的兄弟的社会主义阵营大家庭紧密团结在一起的朝鲜人民，正在粉碎着美帝国主义永久分裂他们的祖国、变他们的祖国为美帝国主义殖民地的奴化政策，并对祖国和平统一这一伟大事业的早日实现充满了信心。
