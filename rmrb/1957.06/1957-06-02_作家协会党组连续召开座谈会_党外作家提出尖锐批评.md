Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Ding reports: The Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association continued to invite more than twenty non-Party writers to symposiums on the 24th, 28th, and 30th, asking them to help the Party organization of the Association to rectify its work. In addition, on the 27th, members of the China Democratic League working at the Association were invited to offer suggestions to the Party Group.

“The rectification movement of the Writers Association has not yet started,” and “The rectification movement of the Writers Association gives people a feeling of being airtight and oppressive,” were the feelings expressed by poets Xu Chi and Lü Jian at the meeting. Xu Chi said that what everyone said at the symposium may not necessarily be from the bottom of their hearts, and the whispers outside the meeting must be much sharper than those at the meeting. To hear these whispers, the Party Group of the Association must do a thorough job.

The writers criticized the Association's sectarianism. Translator Jin Ren said that at present, the Chinese Writers Association has more than seven hundred members, most of whom are Party member writers, while many older writers are kept outside the Association's door. Poet Xu Chi said that to solve the problem of Party-masses relations, the Party should come and feel the hearts of non-Party writers. For seven or eight years, the Party has not come to feel my heart, although my heart is burning hot.

Writer Bi Ye said: We are doing the work of spring, but living through the days of winter. Especially between Party member writers and non-Party writers, there is always an icy snow wall separating them. He asked Party member writers to extend a hand of friendship to non-Party writers. Bi Ye talked about the cold shoulder he had received for many years after his novel "Our Strength is Invincible" was criticized. He hoped that literary leaders and literary friends would not discriminate against writers who had published erroneous works, but would enthusiastically help them and give them the courage to correct their errors.

Writer Shu Wu said that there are some unpleasant atmospheres in literary circles. For example, writers are divided too clearly into high, low, big, and small, and bureaucratic habits have arisen for no reason. He said that feudal literati still advocated "scholarly elegance is like flesh and blood," and "high officials" and "small literati" still echoed each other, so why should we divide them into ranks today?

Writer Yao Xueyin said that some non-Party writers have been suppressed in recent years, leading to pessimism. They support the Party's literary cause, but feel that they are on the outside, seeing everything leaping forward, but they have no future. They don't know when they will be able to integrate with the new society. He hoped that Party member writers and non-Party writers would compete together in creation under the leadership of the Party.

The writers attacked the negative impact of dogmatism on creation and readers.

Writer Wang Jinding said that every year they are opposing dogmatism, but the reason it cannot be eliminated is that they are opposing dogmatism with dogmatism. He hoped that more theoretical articles would appear that oppose dogmatism and combine with the practice of creation; and more articles that correctly guide readers to appreciate literary works.

Writer Shu Wu said: Even if theoretical criticism is very rude, it is not frightening. What is frightening is the set of things that follow criticism. If a work is criticized, the author's work unit will ask him to make a self-criticism, and self-criticism after self-criticism becomes a matter of the author's ideological quality. Therefore, the author's requirements for theoretical critics are also particularly strict, because a sentence in a critical article will cause various unexpected consequences, which makes theoretical critics afraid to write casually.

Writer Xiao Qian used his own example of not daring to write freely after liberation to illustrate the obstacles to the prosperity of creation caused by the rules and regulations formed by dogmatism.

The translators who attended the meeting asked the Association to pay attention to literary translation work. Feng Yidai said that because of the lack of attention, an incorrect view has arisen in society in recent years, almost treating translators as machines; even publishers think that it takes too long to translate a literary novel in one or two years, and no one knows the hardships of translators. He said that there has been a bad trend since liberation, which is to put a label of bourgeois ideology on those who translate English and American literature. Now there is almost no knowledge of the literary undertakings of some countries. When writers from some capitalist countries come to visit China, the Chinese writers who receive them often have nothing to talk about, because they have no opportunity to even see their works. Ru Long said that the translation team is not small, but almost only "Translation" magazine publishes translations of foreign literary works.

Translators Ye Junjian, Yang Xianyi, Zhang Menghui, Ye Shuifu, Chen Siyong, Liu Liaoyi, Jiang Lu and others who attended the symposium once again appealed for translation work at the meeting. They hoped that the Association would respect translators and protect their interests.

Writers Wang Yao, Rao Mengkan, Jiao Juyin, Liu Shousong, Chen Bocui, Jin Kemu, Li Changzhi and others who attended the symposium also spoke enthusiastically and offered many suggestions to the Writers Association.

### 作家协会党组连续召开座谈会  党外作家提出尖锐批评

    作家协会党组连续召开座谈会
    党外作家提出尖锐批评
    本报特约稿　新华社记者沈鼎报道：中国作家协会党组继续在24日、28日、30日分别邀请二十多位党外作家举行座谈会，要求他们帮助协会的党组织整风，另外，在27日邀请在协会工作的民盟盟员向党组提意见。
    “作家协会的整风运动还没有开展”、“作家协会的整风运动给人密不透风、沉闷的感觉”，这是诗人徐迟和吕剑在会上发表的感想。徐迟说，大家在座谈会上讲的话不一定就是心底的话，会外的窃窃私语一定会比会上尖锐得多，要听到这些私语，协会党组还必须深入地做一番工作。
    作家们批评了协会的宗派主义。翻译家金人说，目前中国作家协会有七百多个会员，其中大部分是党员作家，而很多老作家却被关在协会的门外。诗人徐迟说，要解决党群关系问题，党就应该来摸摸党外作家的心。七、八年来，党就没有来摸过我的心，虽然我的心是火热的。
    作家碧野说：我们做的是春天的工作，过的却是冬天的日子。特别是党员作家和党外作家之间总是隔着一座冰冻的雪墙。他要求党员作家向党外作家伸出友谊的手来。碧野谈到了自从他的小说“我们的力量是无敌的”被批评之后多年来受到的冷遇。他希望文艺界领导人和文艺界朋友们对发表了错误作品的作家不要歧视，而要热情地帮助他，让他有勇气来改正错误。
    作家舒芜说，文艺界存在着一些令人不快的风气。例如作家之间高、低、大、小分得太清，官僚习气不知何由而起。他说，封建文人尚且提倡“斯文同骨肉”，“大官”和“小文人”之间还互相唱和，难道今天反而要来分个等级？
    作家姚雪垠说，党外作家中间有些人在这几年中受到压制，以至产生悲观情绪。他们拥护党的文艺事业，但感到自己在圈外，看到一切都在飞跃前进，但自己没有前途。不知道自己何时才能够同新社会水乳交融。他希望党员作家和党外作家一起在党的领导下，在创作上来进行竞赛。
    作家们抨击了教条主义给予创作、给予读者的恶劣影响。
    作家汪金丁说，年年都在反对教条主义，反不掉的原因是以教条主义去反对教条主义。他希望多出现一些反对教条主义、结合创作实际的理论文章；多出现一些正确指导读者欣赏文艺作品的文章。
    作家舒芜说：理论批评即使很粗暴也不能令人害怕，可怕的是批评后面随之而来的一套东西。一篇作品受了批评，作者所在单位就要他检讨，检讨来、检讨去就成为本人的思想品质问题。因之，作者对理论批评家的要求也特别严格，因为批评文章上的一句话，就会引起各种意想不到的后果，这样使理论批评家也不敢随便动笔。
    作家萧乾以他自己在解放后不敢放手写作为例，说明由于教条主义束缚而形成的清规戒律对繁荣创作的障碍。
    到会翻译家要求协会重视文学翻译工作。冯亦代说，由于不予重视，这几年来社会上已经产生一种不正确的看法，几乎把翻译家当作一架机器；连出版社也这样，听说一部文艺小说要译一、两年就嫌时间太长，翻译家的甘苦没有人知道。他说，解放后有一种坏风气，这就是给翻译英美文学的人都戴上一顶资产阶级思想的帽子。现在对某些国家的文学事业以至到了一无所知的程度。有一些资本主义国家的作家来中国访问，接待他们的中国作家常常无话可谈，因为连他们的作品都没有机会看到。汝龙说，翻译队伍倒不小，可是发表外国文学作品译文的几乎就是“译文”一家而已。
    参加座谈会的翻译家叶君健、杨宪益、张孟恢、叶水夫、陈斯庸、刘辽逸、蒋路等人再次在会上为翻译工作呼吁，他们希望协会尊重翻译家，并且保护翻译家的利益。
    参加座谈会的作家王瑶、饶孟侃、焦菊隐、刘绶松、陈伯吹、金克木、李长之等也都踊跃发言，向作家协会提出许多意见。
