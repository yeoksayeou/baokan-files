According to Tianjin Daily: People from all walks of life in Tianjin, with extreme excitement, eagerly read Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and conducted preliminary discussions.

The workers of Tianjin Bicycle Factory, Tianjin Cigarette Factory, the Seventh Joint State-Private Factory of Tianjin Dye Chemical Industry Company, and the State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill all held discussions and read the newspaper. Li Quanzhi, a worker at the No. 6 Cotton Mill, said: After reading Chairman Mao's report, I understood clearly who are the people and who are the enemies at this stage. We must fight the enemies to the end.

Cao Mingshan, a member of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Lilou Township, said: What Chairman Mao said is absolutely right. Some people say that collectivization is not superior, which is nonsense. Take our cooperative as an example, we had a great harvest in the first year of running the advanced cooperative last year, with an average income of more than 1,000 yuan per household. This year, the cooperative will also open rice paddies. Now the cooperative is truly full of chickens, ducks, and pigs. The benefits of cooperatives are too great to mention at once.

Many members of democratic parties carefully read Chairman Mao's speech. Hu Yi, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said: In Chairman Mao's speech, he specifically instructed us with six criteria for judging the right and wrong of words and actions, and also sincerely pointed out the path forward for the democratic parties and the vast number of intellectuals.

Teachers and students of Nankai University and Tianjin University actively studied Chairman Mao's speech. After reading Chairman Mao's speech, many students were greatly inspired and educated, and initially felt that there were many confused understandings in their minds. The publication of Chairman Mao's speech gave great encouragement to the professors who are fighting against the rightists. Professor Ji Tao Da happily said, "The publication of Chairman Mao's speech is a powerful weapon for us to fight against the rightists!"

Many staff members of government agencies carefully read the full text of Chairman Mao's speech, and some held discussions. Liu Xianchang, a staff member of the Hexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: The publication of Chairman Mao's speech refutes the fallacy that Marxism-Leninism does not apply to many places in China. Chairman Mao's speech is a new development of Marxism-Leninism and a concrete application of Marxism-Leninism in China.

Our newspaper, Changchun, 21st dispatch: Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" attracts people from all walks of life in Changchun like a magnet. The vast number of workers and intellectuals repeatedly read this article. After reading Chairman Mao's article, Liu Xianming, a turner at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said: Chairman Mao's speech helps us to correctly understand the contradictions among the people and gives us the weapon to distinguish between right and wrong.

Wu Xuezhou, Director of the Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Changchun Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: The anti-socialist fallacies of the rightists mostly come from the democratic parties, from the intellectuals, and there is a large market for these fallacies among the intellectuals. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the self-transformation of intellectuals and the ideological work of democratic parties. This is also a difficult task for our democratic parties.

Deng Yonghui, Standing Committee Member of the Changchun Federation of Industry and Commerce and Member of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, talked about his thoughts after reading the "Problem of Industrialists and Businessmen" section of the speech. He said: Industrialists and businessmen have two sides and must be reformed. Personally, I have been in business since I was eighteen years old. For thirty years, what I have learned and done is to exploit people. I relied on exploitation to live a fairly wealthy life and gained a considerable position in society. Now, there must be a major turn – to build socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party, how can it be done without transformation? As for the average industrialists and businessmen, the two sides are also obvious. During the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, industrialists and businessmen actively demanded joint state-private ownership, but after the opening of the free market last winter, some industrialists and businessmen saw that the free market was profitable and demanded to withdraw from joint state-private ownership and go to the free market to speculate. Since industrialists and businessmen have two sides, they must be reformed. After reading Chairman Mao's speech, I feel that, just as Chairman Mao said, the opinion that there is no two-sidedness and no need for reform is not the wish of most industrialists and businessmen.

　　天津、长春人民争先恐后学习毛主席的报告
    大大充实了同右派斗争的理论力量
    本报讯　据天津日报讯：天津市各界人民怀着极度兴奋的心情，争先恐后地阅读了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，并分别作了初步讨论。
    天津自行车厂、天津卷烟厂、天津市染料化学工业公司公私合营第七厂以及国营棉纺六厂的职工都进行座谈、读报。棉纺六厂工人李全直说：看了毛主席的报告，使我弄清楚了在现阶段，什么是人民，什么是敌人。我们一定要同敌人斗争到底。
    李楼乡红光农业社社员曹明善说：毛主席说的太对了。有人说合作化不优越，那是胡说。就拿我们社来说，去年第一年办高级社就来个大丰收，每户社员平均收入一千多元。今年社里还要开稻田。现在社里真是鸡鸭成群猪满圈。合作社的好处太大啦，一时说不完。
    许多民主党派成员认真地阅读了毛主席的讲演。民盟天津市委员会副主任委员胡毅说：毛主席的讲演中，具体地指示给我们用以判断言论和行动是非的六条标准，也非常恳切地指出了各民主党派和广大知识分子前进的道路。
    南开大学、天津大学教师和学生纷纷学习毛主席的讲演。不少同学阅读了毛主席的讲演后，受到了很大的启发和教育，初步感觉到自己思想上存在着许多糊涂认识。毛主席讲演的发表，给正在同右派分子进行斗争的教授们很大鼓舞。季陶达老教授高兴地说：“毛主席讲演的发表，这是我们同右派分子斗争的有力武器！”
    许多机关工作人员都认真阅读了毛主席的讲演全文，有的并举行了座谈。中共河西区委员会工作人员刘宪昌说：毛主席这篇讲演的发表，使得那种认为马列主义在中国许多地方对不上号的谬论不攻自破。毛主席的这篇讲演正是马克思列宁主义的新发展，也正是马克思列宁主义在中国具体运用的典范。
    本报长春21日电　毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，像磁铁一般吸引着长春市各界人民。广大职工和知识分子反复阅读了这篇文章。第一汽车制造厂车工刘显明读完了毛主席的文章后说：毛主席的讲演帮助我们正确地认识了人民内部矛盾，使我们掌握了分辨是非的武器。
    中国科学院应用化学研究所所长、九三学社长春分社主任委员吴学周说：右派分子的反社会主义谬论，大部分出于民主党派，出于知识分子，而且谬论在知识分子中还有很大市场。因此加强知识分子的自我改造和民主党派的思想工作是非常重要的。这也是我们民主党派的艰巨任务。
    长春市工商联常委、民建市委委员邓永惠，谈到读了讲演中“工商业者问题”一段后的感想。他说：工商业者是有两面性的，必须加强改造。从我个人来讲，我十八岁经商，三十年来，所学所做的就是剥削人。我靠着剥削过着相当富足的生活，在社会上有了相当的地位。现在要来个大转弯——在共产党领导下建设社会主义，不改造怎么能行呢？至于一般的工商业者，两面性也是明显的。在私营工商业社会主义改造时，工商业者积极要求公私合营，但是在去冬开放自由市场之后，有些工商业者看到自由市场有利可图，便要求退出公私合营，到自由市场去投机。工商业者既然有两面性，就要改造。看了毛主席的讲演之后，我觉得正像毛主席讲的那样，没有两面性、不需要改造的意见，并不是大多数工商业者的愿望。
