　　Boldly Carry Out Criticism, Enthusiastically Conduct Debate
　　-- Speech at the Symposium Convened by the Party Committee on June 10th
　　Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University

Since the rectification campaign began, I myself have received a great deal of education both on and off campus, at symposiums, in newspapers, and through various opinions and criticisms. Now I would like to share some of my views.

I. Main Aspects of the Rectification Campaign in Our School

We are helping the Party to rectify its work in order to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Therefore, the method we adopt is unity, criticism, unity, and the motive should be goodwill. Starting from the desire for unity, the effect should also be to achieve the goal of unity. Therefore, we must be calm, gentle, serious, and conscientious, in order to achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong, improving our work, and making progress together. We criticize others in order to help them progress, and others criticize me in order to help me progress. We must unite together on the common basis of socialism. Different opinions can be gradually reconciled through discussion. All attempts to use subjectivism to oppose subjectivism, to use bureaucracy to oppose bureaucracy, or to use another kind of sectarianism to oppose the Party's sectarianism are inappropriate and are unlikely to achieve the desired results.

Since the beginning of the movement in our school, thanks to the implementation of the policy of "great blooming and great contending," the previously dull atmosphere has become unprecedentedly lively. Everyone has put forward a large number of opinions and criticisms, some of which are very important issues, and this is all very good.

The vast majority of the opinions put forward by everyone are correct and constructive. They proceed from the desire for unity and are expected to achieve a new unity through criticism. Many opinions are directed at the "three isms," hitting the nail on the head and truly playing a role in "treating the illness to save the patient." If these opinions can cure the patient and correct the shortcomings, achieving the purpose of improving the work and benefiting socialism, we not only welcome such opinions, but also appreciate these doctors who treat the illness.

In the work of the school, the shortcomings and errors manifested by the "three isms" are difficult to see if we only rely on self-examination without rectification and without launching mass criticism.

We work in higher normal schools, and we are not only educators ourselves, but also cultivate young people who directly educate others. Therefore, for our Party Committee and the leadership of the school, the principle of "must be educated first" is even more important.

Some teachers have recently raised the issue of experts running education, which should be taken seriously and should be a wake-up call. The leadership must understand the business; if they don't understand, it doesn't matter, they should learn. If they don't understand and don't learn, and don't study, and are busy all day long, only grasping administrative affairs and only dealing with temporary work, being pushed by tasks, then the leadership will be passive. The most important work in the school, such as teaching, scientific research, etc., cannot be managed. Without proper arrangements, the school will naturally have a weak academic atmosphere and the quality of education cannot be improved. This is the most important key to the work of the school, and if not enough attention is paid to this aspect, problems will follow. The problem is not that the Party Committee has to learn a certain course, but "how to run a higher normal school well," which is the most important specialty. I think that the Party Committee and other administrative comrades should pay close attention to this aspect in the future, and should continue to humbly listen to the opinions of teachers and absorb the previous good experiences as a reference for improving their work in the future.

Another example is our personnel work: in the arrangement of personnel, we must gradually achieve that people give their best, talents are fully utilized, and we must properly and rationally use and retain people, respect the learning and knowledge of old teachers, so that they can give full play to their strengths, pay attention to cultivating new forces, so as to inherit the knowledge of the older generation, so that they can grow rapidly in humble learning, and we must help teachers who already have the ability to work independently in all aspects and give play to their enthusiasm. In short, our team of hundreds of teachers is an extremely important treasure of the school. All subjective and inappropriate evaluations and sectarian arrangements will cause great losses. Of course, this is easier said than done, but we can set the direction and gradually solve it.

In other aspects, such as the school's ideological education, how to help intellectuals further transform and improve their thinking, administrative work, and library work, there are still shortcomings in our arrangements, and the opinions put forward by everyone this time should be cherished.

It should be said that these good and constructive opinions are the main aspect. I heard that some units have received dozens of opinions after sorting them out, which are our mirror. We must look in the mirror and wash away the dust on our faces. It doesn't matter if there are shortcomings and errors, as long as they can be gradually corrected. Under the leadership of the Party's rectification movement and under the supervision of the masses, we have confidence that our work will be improved better.

Moreover, the rectification has only just begun, and "blooming and contending" is the Party's long-term policy. At present, some people have already achieved "great blooming and great contending," saying everything, while others have only "small blooming and small contending," and some have not even "bloomed or contended" at all. In the future, we must continue to encourage everyone to "bloom and contend," and the leading comrades must listen more humbly to opinions from all sides.

II. Contending and Blooming Together

It is necessary for us to recognize this main aspect, but we cannot deny that some of the opinions and criticisms are not entirely correct, and a very small number are very incorrect. Therefore, this movement is the best learning opportunity for each of us. We must learn to be good at distinguishing right from wrong and to analyze good and evil.

A few days ago, the People's Daily published an article entitled "Is it good or bad to give good opinions?" I think it is difficult to abstractly explain whether it is good or bad if we leave the opinion itself. Because there are two kinds of criticism: one is correct opinions and constructive criticism, which we must listen to, study, and adopt. However, for those erroneous remarks that are not conducive to the cause of socialism, since we are people responsible for the cause of the people, we cannot be muddle-headed and indiscriminately say that all criticisms are beneficial to the people. Moreover, for erroneous opinions, even those that are completely inconsistent with the facts or that reverse black and white, we cannot but give correct counter-criticism.

Therefore, I think of the "contending" in "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and the "together" in "letting a hundred flowers bloom," which are extremely meaningful. We must not only "bloom," but also "bloom together," and we must not only "contend," but also "contend." Only through contending can we distinguish right from wrong. If we do not allow others to contend, and as soon as someone contends, we put a big label on them of "preventing contending," saying that they are going to "take back" or that they are a "countercurrent," etc., then this is the real "shield to prevent contending."

It is certainly not good for one flower to bloom alone or for one school to contend alone. But how can it be said to conform to the spirit of blooming and contending if ninety-nine schools bloom, but one flower does not bloom, and ninety-nine schools contend, but one school does not contend?

Therefore, suppressing criticism is absolutely not allowed. But suppressing counter-criticism is also wrong.

We are helping the Party to rectify its work in order to rectify the Party, not to overthrow the Party. Opposing Party members who undermine the socialist system is for the purpose of rectifying the system and strengthening the system, not to destroy the system or abolish the system. What we advocate is washing our faces, washing away all the dust, not beheading. Our criticism is to improve our work and make society move forward, not to pull society backward. It is to better facilitate the socialist road, not to turn back to the capitalist road.

Criticizing people should be based on facts. All-round affirmation, saying that everything bad is good, is fundamentally inconsistent with the spirit of rectification, which is wrong; all-round negation, saying that everything is bad, is also inconsistent with objective facts. I think that some criticisms in our school are not based on facts either. Chairman Mao said that in letting a hundred flowers bloom, there are fragrant flowers, there are poisonous weeds, and ghosts and monsters are all released. We are not afraid of poisonous weeds, but we cannot say that poisonous weeds are fragrant flowers. It should be affirmed that the vast majority of the contradictions exposed by everyone are beneficial to us, and the Party Committee should consider them humbly so that the work can be improved. And it should also be said that there are many shortcomings and errors in our school's work, and even some shortcomings and errors are serious. However, if we think that the work in the past few years has been worthless, that is an exaggeration. Many people have recently said that the sentence "achievements are the main thing" has become a vulgar and empty formula. But friends! The achievements of our school's work are still the main thing! This should be affirmed! Today I will not say much about the specific achievements here, but it should be explained that the achievements are achieved, of course, first of all due to the Party's correct leadership. Some people think that saying that the Party's achievements is singing praises. If there is merit and virtue, why can't we sing and praise? But at the same time, we must not obliterate the active efforts of all our teachers, students, and staff members of Beijing Normal University. Everyone has contributed a lot of strength. Saying that the school is "dark" and "hell" completely negates the work done by everyone under the leadership of the Party, which is extremely wrong from any point of view.

All remarks that depart from the desire for unity and from socialism are unfavorable. We cannot say that shortcomings are advantages, resist criticism, or conceal contradictions; nor can we regard respect as insult, or push all mistakes to others. All so-called "criticisms" that uglify others, are malicious, or even adopt personal attacks, I don't think are from the desire for unity. "Beheading and displaying the head to the public" may be pleasant, but it is not a way to solve contradictions among the people after all.

III. On the Issue of the Party Committee's Leadership

I personally feel that it is a better method to have division of labor and responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party Committee. For major administrative decisions in the school, such as work guidelines, plans, improving teaching quality, and training graduate students, on the basis of the collective leadership of the Party Committee, strengthening the role of the School Affairs Committee, widely absorbing opinions from all aspects of non-Party members, studying and discussing, making resolutions, and implementing them is a very good method. Only in this way can our work possibly make fewer mistakes and be able to discover and correct mistakes in time.

I think that the leadership work of the school in the future should pay attention to how to strengthen the Party's collective leadership and how to correctly implement the mass line. If there are problems in the past with unwillingness or inability to cooperate with non-Party members, they should be corrected, democracy should be expanded, and the opinions of teachers should be listened to humbly and widely, especially on specific teaching issues such as teaching plans. The opinions of teachers should be listened to and respected well in order to be more realistic. We must change the shortcomings in the practice of the Party Committee's collective leadership and give play to the Party's leading role and core role. I think the main problem is this, not others.

Professor governing the school, in the past before liberation, did play a great role in some schools, but today it is worth considering, and today's universities are essentially different from the universities of the old society, and the old methods will not work. I also agree with what Director Wang Kunren said: if professors run the school, how much time will there be for teaching and scientific research?

The term "democratic governance of the school" is also very vague and does not explain any system. I think that strengthening democracy under the leadership of the Party in the future must be affirmed. Democratic governance of the school still needs to be studied.

These are my personal views. I am also "contending" and they are not any conclusion.

On the morning of May 8th, the Guangming Daily invited me to express my views on the leadership system of universities. On the afternoon of that day, at a meeting convened by the Party Committee of our school, a reporter from the Guangming Daily also came to participate. I wrote these opinions to them. Later, I thought of changing one or two words, and the reporter said: please don't let the Party member president see it. I think my opinions are my personal responsibility. Since it is contending, I also have the right to contend. If my opinions are wrong, everyone can criticize them. We are helping the Party to rectify its work, and it is not that even Party members cannot be contacted.

I am not giving opinions to this reporter, but this can represent a kind of ideological reflection. Some people do think that they have given the Party a lot of opinions to help the Party rectify its work, and the Party is simply terrible, and Party members have become the target of public criticism. Some people are unwilling to contact them. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the rectification movement.

Later, the Guangming Daily, probably under the ideological leadership of Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping! My opinion has not been published at all until now.

In universities, the leadership of the Party cannot be shaken. All opinions that want to weaken the leadership of the Party or let the Communist Party withdraw from the school are inappropriate. Without the leadership of the Party, how can we run socialist universities well? This is an obvious truth. Even if there are many shortcomings in the work of some schools or some Party committees, it is still undeniable that the Party can lead universities.

I will now say the above three points of view. I think that our school's policy of "great blooming and great contending" in the future will not change. We must truly achieve deep blooming and thorough releasing, and we must truly achieve that everyone can know everything and say everything. At the same time, we must also be able to bloom and contend together. The school leadership will always welcome active criticism. Criticism may as well be sharp, and at the same time, there can be correct counter-criticism. For words and deeds that violate socialism, we must point them out in time, and refute the very few people who "turn their hands into clouds and rain," which is our responsibility. This is to boldly carry out criticism and enthusiastically conduct debate, but whether it is criticism or debate, we must not act emotionally, but must proceed from the desire for unity. Through the rectification movement, we can improve and strengthen the leadership work of our school's Party, overcome the three major isms in our work, and truly overcome shortcomings, correct errors, and closely connect the relationship between the Party and the masses, so as to achieve the purpose of strengthening unity, improving thinking, and improving work.

### 大胆开展批评，热烈进行争论——在六月十日党委召集的座谈会上的发言

　　大胆开展批评，热烈进行争论
　　——在六月十日党委召集的座谈会上的发言
　　北京师范大学校长  陈垣
    自从整风运动开始以来，我自己在校内校外，在座谈会上，在报纸上，在各种意见和批评当中，都受到很大的教育。我现在把我的几点看法谈一谈。
    一、我校整风运动的主要方面
    我们帮助党整风，是为了正确的处理人民内部的矛盾。因此我们所采取的办法是团结，批评，团结，动机应该是善意的。从团结的愿望出发，而效果也是要达到团结的目的，因此我们要平心静气，细雨和风，既要严肃，又要认真，以达到明辨是非，改进工作，共同进步的目的。我们批评别人，是为了使别人进步，别人批评我，也是为帮助我进步，我们要在共同一致的社会主义基础上，共同团结。意见不同，可以经过讨论，逐步求得一致。所有一切用主观主义来反对主观主义，用官僚主义来反对官僚主义，用另一种宗派主义来反对党的宗派主义的作法，都是不应该的，而且也很难达到所期的效果。
    我们学校，自从运动开始以来，由于执行了大放大鸣的方针，过去沉闷的空气，空前活跃起来，大家提出了大量的意见和批评，其中有些意见是很重要的问题，这都是非常好的。
    大家提出的意见，绝大多数是正确的，是建设性的，是从团结愿望出发，准备经过批评，就能达到新的团结的愿望。很多意见都是针对着三个主义，击中要害，真正能起到“治病救人”的作用。由于这些意见，把病人治好，把缺点改正，达到改进工作的目的，对于社会主义有利，我们不仅欢迎这样的意见，而且感激这些治病的医生。
    在学校的工作中，由于三个主义表现出来的缺点和错误，如果不是整风，不是开展了群众性的批评，只靠自己检查，是很难看到的。
    我们在高等师范学校工作，不但自己是教育人的人，而且培养的青年，又是直接教育人的人，因此我们的党委，学校的领导，对于“必须先受教育”这一原则，就显得更为重要。
    有的先生们最近提出内行办教育的问题，亟应引起重视，应当发人猛省。领导上必须懂得业务，不懂不要紧，要学习。如果不懂又不学习，不钻研，终日忙忙碌碌，只抓行政事务，只招架临时性的工作，被任务推着走，则领导形成被动。对学校里最主要的工作，如教学工作，科学研究工作等等，反倒管不起来。没有妥善的安排，则学校里自然就会有学术空气淡薄，教育质量不能提高等现象，而这正是学校工作的最主要的关键，在这方面注意不够，问题就会接踵而至。问题还不是党委去学那一门课程，而“如何办好高师”，这就是最主要的专业。我觉得党委，以及其他行政负责同志，今后要切实注意这一方面的问题，并应继续虚心倾听教师的意见，吸取以往的优良的经验，作为今后改进工作的参考。
    又如我们的人事工作：人事的安排上，要逐渐作到人尽其材，材尽其用，要妥善的合理的使用和留用，尊重老教师的学业和知识，使他们能发挥特长，注意培养新生力量，以继承老一辈的学识，使他们在虚心学习中，迅速的成长，已有独立工作能力的教师们，要在各方面帮助他们，发挥他们的积极性。总之，我们几百人的教师队伍，是学校极重要的财宝。一切主观主义的不恰当的估价，宗派主义的安排，都会造成很大的损失。当然这话说来容易，作起来也不是很简单的事情，我们可以规定出方向，逐渐解决。
    其他关于学校的思想教育，如何帮助知识分子思想进一步改造和提高，关于行政事务工作，关于图书资料工作等等，我们的安排上都还存在有缺点，这次大家提出的意见，都应当珍视。
    应该说，这些好的建设性的意见，是主要的一方面。听说有些单位收到的意见，整理归纳后都是几十条，这就是我们的镜子，要对着镜子，把脸上存在的灰尘洗去。有缺点和错误，不要紧，只要能逐渐改掉。在党的领导的整风运动中，在群众的监督下，我们有信心，我们的工作一定能改得更好。
    而且整风不过刚刚开始，鸣放是党的长期的政策，目前有的人已经作到大鸣大放，无话不说，有的人还只是小鸣小放，甚至还有的人未鸣未放，今后还要继续鼓励大家鸣放，领导同志还要更虚心的倾听各方面的意见。
    二、争鸣和齐放
    我们认识到这主要的一面，是必要的，但是，也不能否认，在意见和批评之中，也有一些是不完全正确的，也还有极少数是很不正确的。因此，这个运动对我们每一个人，都是一次最好的学习机会，要学会善于明辨是非，要学会分析善恶。
    前几天人民日报上发表了一篇文章，题目是“好提意见究竟是好是坏？”我看如果离开意见的本身，是很难抽象的说明是好是坏的。因为批评有两种，一种是正确的意见，建设性的批评，我们必须加以倾听、研究和采纳，可是，那些不利于社会主义事业的错误言论，我们既然是对人民事业负责的人，就不能胡里胡涂、不加区别地把一切批评都说成是对人民有益的，而且对错误的意见，甚至是完全不符合事实的，或者是颠倒黑白的意见，就不能不予以正确的反批评。
    我因此想到百家争鸣的“争”字，和百花齐放的“齐”字，是极有意义的，不仅要“放”，而且要“齐放”，不仅要“鸣”，而且要“争鸣”。有鸣有放，还要有争。争才能分辨出是非，不许别人争，只要有人争就先给他扣上“阻止争鸣”的大帽子，就说是要“收”了，就说是一股“逆流”如何如何等等，这才是真正的“阻止争鸣”的挡箭牌。
    一花独放，一家独鸣，当然不好，而九十九家都放，独有一花不放，九十九家都鸣，独有一家不鸣，这又怎么能说是符合鸣放的精神呢？
    所以压制批评是绝对不容许的。但压制反批评也是错误的。
    我们帮助党整风，是要把党整好，不是要把党整垮。反对党员破坏社会主义制度，其目的是为了整顿制度、加强制度，而不是要破坏制度、取消制度。我们主张的是洗脸，把尘污都洗掉，而不是要杀头。我们批评是为了改进工作，使社会更前进，而不是把社会往后拉。是为更利于走社会主义道路，而不是翻回头走资本主义道路。
    批评人要实事求是。全面肯定，把一切坏的都说成好，根本不符合整风的精神，这是不对的；全面否定，把任何事情都说成坏，也是不合乎客观事实的。我看在我们学校里，也有些批评并不是实事求是。毛主席说百花齐放，香花也有，毒草也有，牛鬼蛇神，都放了出来。我们不怕毒草，但总不能把毒草说是香花。应当肯定的承认，大家所揭发的矛盾中，有绝大多数对于我们是有益的，党委要虚心考虑，使工作得到改进。而且也应当说在我们学校工作上，有不少缺点和错误，甚至有些缺点和错误是严重的，但是如果认为几年来的工作一无是处，那未免过甚其辞。很多人最近都把“成绩是主要的”这句话，说成了庸俗的空洞的公式。但是朋友们！我们学校的工作，成绩还是主要的！这一点应当肯定！今天我在这里也不多说具体的成绩，但应当说明所以能取得成绩，当然首先是由于党的正确的领导，有人认为，说党的成绩是歌功颂德，如果有功有德，为什么不能歌不能颂呢？但是，与这同时，我们也万不能抹煞，所有我们师大的教职学工，所有师大的成员的积极努力，大家都是贡献了不少力量的。把学校说成“黑暗”，说成“地狱”，就把大家在党领导下所做的工作完全否定了，无论在什么角度来看，都是极端错误的。
    提意见的人，凡是离开了从团结愿望出发，离开了社会主义的言论，都是不利的，不能把缺点说成优点，抗拒批评，掩饰矛盾；也不能把尊重当作侮辱，把错误都推给别人。一切把别人丑化的，恶意的，甚至是采用人身攻击的所谓“批评”，我看都不是从团结愿望出发的。“枭首示众”，说来倒也痛快，但终究不是解决人民内部矛盾的办法。
    三、关于党委的领导问题
    我个人觉得在党委集体领导下，分工负责是比较好的办法。学校里行政大事的决定，如工作方针、计划，提高教学质量，培养研究生等等工作，在党委集体领导的基础上，加强校务委员会的作用，广泛吸取党外人士各方面的意见，研究讨论，作出决议，贯彻执行，是很好的办法。这样才能使我们的工作有可能少犯错误，并能及时发现和纠正错误。
    我以为今后的学校领导工作，应当注意的是如何加强党的集体领导，如何正确的实行群众路线的问题。过去如有不愿意或不善于同党外人士合作的毛病，要纠正过来，扩大民主，虚心、广泛的听取教师们的意见，尤其是有关教学上的具体问题，如教学计划等等，更要很好的听取并尊重教师们的意见，才能更符合实际。要改变在党委集体领导的实践中存在着的缺点，发挥党的领导作用和核心作用。我看问题主要的是这个，而不是其他。
    教授治校，在解放以前，有的学校确曾起过很大作用，但是今天则值得考虑，而且今天的高等学校与旧社会的高等学校，有本质的不同，用旧的办法是行不通的。我也同意汪堃仁主任所说的话：如果教授治校，还有什么时间搞教学和科学研究呢？
    关于民主治校，这个提法，也很模糊，不能说明什么制度。我想今后在党委领导下加强民主，这是必需肯定的。民主治校云云还要研究。
    这是我个人的看法，我也是在鸣，也并不是什么定论。
    在5月8日上午，光明日报曾约我对高校领导体制问题发表意见，就在这天下午，我校党委召集的一个会上，光明日报记者也来参加，我就把这意见写给他们，以后，我想起要改动一两个字，而这位记者同志说：请我不要给党员校长看。我想我的意见由我个人负责，既然是争鸣，我也有争的权利，我的意见不对，大家可以批评。我们帮助党整风，也并不是连党员都不能接触了。
    我并不是给这位记者同志提意见，不过这却可以代表一种思想反映。有人确实以为帮助党整风，给党提了很多意见，党简直糟透了，党员也成了众矢之的，有人不愿接触他们了，这是根本对整风运动的误解。
    后来光明日报，大概是在储安平总编辑思想领导之下吧！我的意见根本到现在也没发表。
    在高等学校里，党的领导不可动摇，一切想要削弱党的领导或让共产党退出学校的意见，都是不恰当的。如果没有党的领导，如何能办好社会主义的高等学校？这是浅而易见的道理。某些学校，某些党委的工作上，纵然有不少缺点，但是党能领导高等学校，这是肯定不移的。
    我现在先说以上三点意见。我想我们学校今后大鸣大放的方针是不变的，要真正做到鸣得深、放得透，要真正做到人人能够知无不言，言无不尽。同时也要能够齐放、争鸣。学校领导永远欢迎积极的批评，批评时也不妨尖锐，同时也可以有正确的反批评，对于违反社会主义的言论行动，及时指出，对极个别的“翻手作云复手雨”的人们予以驳斥，这是我们的责任，这就是大胆开展批评，热烈进行争论，但是不管是批评还是争论，都不能以意气用事，都要从团结的愿望出发。要通过整风运动，使我们学校党的领导工作能够改进和加强，使我们工作中的三大主义能够克服，使我们真正能作到克服缺点、纠正错误，密切党群关系，达到加强团结，提高思想，改进工作的目的。
