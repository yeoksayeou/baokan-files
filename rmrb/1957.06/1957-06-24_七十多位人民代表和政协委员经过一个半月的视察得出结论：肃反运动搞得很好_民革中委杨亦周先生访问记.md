    Over Seventy People's Representatives and CPPCC Members Conclude After a Month and a Half of Inspection:
    The Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement Was Carried Out Very Well
    ——An Interview with Mr. Yang Yizhou, Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang
  　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Fang Ling
    Was the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement really "a complete mess"? Yang Yizhou, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, gave a completely negative answer. He said that the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement was absolutely necessary and the achievements were great.
    Yang Yizhou is the Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and a representative of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress. Recently, he and more than seventy representatives of the Municipal People's Congress and CPPCC members conducted an inspection of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries work in Tianjin for a month and a half. They listened to work reports from public security, procuratorial, and judicial units, studied more than 300 counterrevolutionary cases on issues such as arrests, appeals, and the mutual restraint of the judicial, procuratorial, and public security departments. They also held eight forums with more than 100 counterrevolutionary criminals serving sentences in prisons and labor reform units, and met with some people who had been struggled against in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement.
    Yang Yizhou cited many specific facts to the reporter to illustrate that the great achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement must be affirmed. He said that as a result of this movement, the number of counterrevolutionary slogans and leaflets found in the city in 1956 decreased by 78.8% compared with 1955; destructive accidents in factories decreased by 77.8%; and public security organs seized 145 various types of long and short guns, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 70 hand grenades and various small bombs. They also cracked down on a batch of counterrevolutionary cases with current activities, many of whom were arrested on the spot while engaging in sabotage activities.
    Yang Yizhou said: In the past, I also had right-leaning paralysis and did not fully understand the harmfulness of counterrevolutionaries. I always felt that the people had seized power and the world was at peace. But after this inspection, I suddenly realized the truth. For example, Huang Yingzhong, a counterrevolutionary element with seven blood debts who was only cleared out in the later stage of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement, was a group leader of the Central Statistics Bureau and an adjutant of the supplementary regiment of the 52nd Army of the Kuomintang. After liberation, he used the pseudonym Zhang Xuecheng to infiltrate the People's Liberation Army and pretended to be active in joining the Communist Party. After being transferred to civilian work in 1954, he was assigned to work at the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank and deceived the trust of party members, becoming a member of the branch committee. Another counterrevolutionary element, Liu Yulin, who was hiding in a surveying team of the Ministry of Water Resources stationed in Tianjin, injured Wang Weihua, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch who actively struggled against him, after his crimes were exposed by the masses. Yang Yizhou said: These facts are enough to show that there were a large number of counterrevolutionaries in our country at that time, and their sabotage activities were serious. Therefore, the movement to eliminate counterrevolutionaries was absolutely correct. Any slander cannot stand.
    Some people say: The targets of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries were subjectively determined by the Communist Party, and the Communist Party members took the opportunity to retaliate, wronging many good people, and even saying that everything was wrong. Yang Yizhou believes that this statement is groundless. He said: From my inspection of this work, as Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing said, the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement is a movement of struggle against the enemy combining specialized organs and the broad masses. In 1955 and 1956, the city received more than 14,000 clues and suspicious materials of various counterrevolutionaries reported by the masses. Li Shaofu, a counterrevolutionary who had been hiding in a kang cave for five years, was arrested because of mass exposure. Under the pressure of the broad masses and the call of the government's lenient policy, 691 counterrevolutionaries surrendered themselves. For example, Yuan Defu, a secret agent of the Kuomintang Security Bureau who blew up a sailboat full of military supplies near the Jinzhong Bridge in the Haihe River in the early days of liberation, and injured eight people at the same time, was sentenced to only five years in prison after surrendering in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement.
    How can these ironclad facts be said to be subjectively determined by the Communist Party? How can it be said that the Communist Party members took the opportunity to retaliate? Yang Yizhou said: In the counterrevolutionary cases I inspected, none of them were handled without repeated investigation and verification, based on conclusive evidence, and in accordance with legal procedures. For example, Huang Jingui, a counterrevolutionary element hiding in the Xinsheng Rubber Industry Cooperative, participated in the "Home-Returning Corps" of landlords to carry out a cruel counter-reckoning against the peasants who had been liberated. He arrested 15 peasants and village cadres, brutally beat them, and often spread rumors to intimidate military families and activists after liberation. Before arresting him, the public security organs had mastered 21 pieces of evidence related to his criminal behavior. Among the arrested counterrevolutionaries, there were also cases where the court returned them to the procuratorial organs for supplementary investigation due to insufficient evidence. For example, Cui Zhiyu, who had served as the captain of the puppet garrison brigade in Xian County, Hebei Province, was returned to the procuratorial organs for supplementary investigation because the criminal circumstances he confessed after his arrest were inconsistent with the corroborating evidence and the materials reported by the masses. There was also Qi Jianhua, a member of the "Three People's Principles Youth League" who had committed crimes in history. After liberation, he privately engraved seals, forged documents, and falsely reported household registrations. After the public security organs mastered his evidence and arrested him according to law, the procuratorate decided to prosecute, but the court believed that he had a honest attitude and thoroughly confessed after his arrest, and that his crimes were not too serious, so he was exempted from prosecution and released leniently after education. Yang Yizhou said: I hope that those who slander the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement as "completely wrong" and speak for counterrevolutionaries without realizing it will also come and see these undeniable facts.
    When the reporter asked him whether he had found any truly wronged cases during the inspection, Yang Yizhou said: When I inspected prisons and labor reform units, I talked with many counterrevolutionary criminals who were serving sentences, and none of them denied their crimes, and none of them thought that arresting them was wrong. I asked them many times if this was the truth? They all answered without hesitation: Never lie, and there were no guards present to monitor them at the time. Their only opinion was to hope that the government would be even more lenient. But, were there any who were wrongly struggled against or wrongly arrested at one time? Yang Yizhou said: Yes. However, some people were struggled against in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement because they usually spread reactionary remarks or did not clearly explain historical problems, which aroused suspicion and questioning from the masses. For example, Li Chongxi, a staff member of the Biology Department of Nankai University, was not a target of struggle in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement. However, the masses revealed many suspicious facts, such as Li Chongxi deliberately destroying many instruments and often saying backward words, so the masses asked him to confess the motives of those words and deeds. Later, after investigation, it was found that Li Chongxi's destruction of instruments was caused by his extreme selfishness and narrow-mindedness, and his backward thinking, and there was no counterrevolutionary behavior. Yang Yizhou believes that it is inevitable that people like this who usually have many suspicious signs will be struggled against by the masses in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement. Wrong arrests are also due to similar reasons. There are also some people who were released after being arrested due to the implementation of new lenient measures. As a result, some people seized on this point to carry out distorted propaganda, clamoring everywhere that the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement violated human rights and arrested people casually. It should be admitted that due to the subjective and bureaucratic work style of relevant personnel in some departments, some problems were not analyzed and studied carefully, and general political and historical problems were regarded as counterrevolutionary crimes, backward or reactionary remarks were regarded as rumors and sabotage aimed at counterrevolution, or liability accidents were regarded as political sabotage accidents, and some were arrested counterrevolutionaries who attempted to reduce their crimes, framed others, and made random accusations, and some were arrested based on incomplete and unreliable enemy and puppet archives, and therefore wrongly arrested some people. But this is, after all, a very small minority and is insignificant compared with the achievements of the entire movement. Moreover, those who were wrongly arrested or wrongly struggled against were quickly rehabilitated once they were discovered. In addition to being released immediately, apologizing to him and explaining to the surrounding masses, his original work was restored and his salary during the period of his arrest was reissued. For those who were released after being leniently treated with minor problems, the government also issued them living allowances and arranged for them to work, and for the "good people with shortcomings" who were struggled against, in addition to publicly making conclusions for them, they were also educated and helped to correct their shortcomings. Yang Yizhou said, it must be pointed out that some units have not dealt with this post-processing work in a timely manner, and this procrastination has caused dissatisfaction among some people and has given those who slander the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement as "a complete mess" a chance to take advantage of it. These departments should immediately reverse this procrastination.
    Yang Yizhou said: The Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement not only cleared out many counterrevolutionaries, brightened the eyes of the people, and further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship; at the same time, it also directly helped many people clarify their political and historical problems and won the trust of the Party and the people. Today, we can conduct open and sharp criticisms of the work of the Party and the state; the undertakings in all aspects can be as "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" as they are today, which is inseparable from the achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries struggle. This is another guarantee for our country to move from victory to victory. We will never allow anyone to slander this just struggle for the country and the people – the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement!

    七十多位人民代表和政协委员经过一个半月的视察得出结论：
    肃反运动搞得很好
    ——民革中委杨亦周先生访问记
  　新华社记者　方凌
    肃反运动究竟是不是“一团糟”？中国国民党革命委员会中央委员、天津市委员会主任委员杨亦周作了完全否定的答复。他说肃反运动是完全必要的，成绩是伟大的。
    杨亦周是政协天津市委员会副主席、天津市人民代表大会代表。最近他和七十多位市人民代表大会代表、政协委员，对天津市的肃反工作进行了一个半月的视察。他们听取了公安、检察和司法等单位的工作报告，就逮捕、申诉和司法、检察、公安三个部门的互相制约等问题研究了三百多件反革命案件，并到监狱和劳动改造单位同正在服刑的反革命罪犯一百多人举行了八次座谈，还接见了一些在肃反运动中被斗争过的人。
    杨亦周向记者引证了许多具体事实说明肃反运动的伟大成绩必须肯定。他说，经过这次运动，1956年在全市发现的反革命标语和传单比1955年减少78.8％；工厂的破坏性事故减少77.8％；公安机关缴获的各种长短枪达一百四十五只，子弹一万多发，手榴弹及各种小型炸弹七十多枚，还破获一批有现行活动的反革命案件，其中有不少是在反革命分子正在进行破坏活动时，当场逮捕的。
    杨亦周说：过去我也有右倾麻痹思想，对反革命分子的危害性认识不足，总觉得人民已掌握了政权，就是天下太平。但是经过这次视察，不禁恍然大悟。例如在肃反运动后期才被清查出来的有七条血债的反革命分子黄应中，他是中统局的一个组长、国民党第五十二军补充兵团的副官。解放后，他化名张学诚混入了解放军，并且伪装积极混入了共产党。1954年转业以后，他被分配到人民银行天津市分行工作，并且骗取了党员的信任，当了支部委员。另一个隐藏在水利部驻在天津的一支勘测总队的反革命分子刘毓林，在群众揭发了他的罪行以后，他杀伤了积极和他作斗争的共青团支部书记王维华。杨亦周说：这些事实已足够说明我们国家在当时是有大量反革命分子存在的，其破坏活动是严重的，因而肃清反革命分子的运动是绝对正确的。任何诬蔑，都站不住脚。
    有人说：肃反对象都是共产党主观确定的，共产党员们借此进行打击报复，冤枉很多好人，甚至说全部搞错了。杨亦周认为这种说法是毫无根据的。他说：从我对这一工作的视察来看，正如公安部罗瑞卿部长所说，肃反运动是专门机关和广大群众相结合的对敌斗争的运动。全市在1955和1956年中，群众检举的各种反革命分子的线索和嫌疑材料，达一万四千多件。在炕洞里躲藏了五年的反革命分子李少甫就是因为群众揭发而被捕的。在广大群众的压力和政府的宽大政策感召下，有六百九十一名反革命分子投案自首，如解放初期曾在海河金钟桥附近炸毁一艘满载军用物资的帆船，同时炸伤八个人的国民党保密局特务袁德福，在肃反运动中自首以后，只被判处五年徒刑。
    这些铁的事实怎么能说是共产党主观确定的呢？又怎么说是共产党员趁机打击报复呢？杨亦周说：在我所视察的那些反革命案件中，没有一件不是经过反复的调查和甄别，根据确凿的证据，按照法律手续来办理的。如隐藏在新生橡胶工业社的反革命分子黄金贵，曾经参加地主“还乡团”对翻身农民进行残酷的反攻倒算，抓捕农民和村干部十五人，进行毒打，解放后还常常造谣恐吓军属和积极分子。公安机关在逮捕他以前，就掌握了有关他犯罪行为的二十一项证据。在逮捕的反革命分子中，也有因证据不够充分，法院重新退回检察机关补充侦察的。如曾在河北省献县任伪警备队大队长的崔志禹，由于他被捕后所招供的犯罪情况，同旁证及群众检举材料有不一致的地方；法院便把它退回检察机关补充侦察。还有一个历史上有罪恶的“三青团”分子齐建华，在解放后还私刻图章，伪造证件，骗报户口，公安机关掌握了他的证据依法逮捕以后，检察院决定起诉，但法院认为他在被捕后态度老实，坦白彻底，而且罪恶不太严重，便免予起诉，经过教育以后宽大释放。杨亦周说：我希望那些诬蔑肃反运动“完全搞错了”而替反革命分子说话还不自觉的人，也来看看这些无容辩驳的事实。
    当记者问他在视察中是否发现一些真正被冤枉的案件时，杨亦周说：我在视察监狱和劳动改造单位时，曾和许多正在服刑的反革命罪犯交谈过，他们没有一个不承认自己的罪行的，没有一个认为把他逮捕起来是冤枉了的。我曾多次问他们这是不是真话？他们都毫不犹疑地回答说：决不撒谎，而且当时并没有警卫人员在场监视。他们唯一的意见，就是希望政府宽大再宽大。但是，究竟有没有一度被错斗或错捕的呢？杨亦周说：有。但是，有的人是因为平常不断散布一些反动言论，或者是历史上有问题没有交代清楚，在肃反运动中引起群众的怀疑追问而被斗争的。如南开大学生物系职员李崇熹，在肃反运动中并不是斗争对象。但是群众揭发出李崇熹曾经故意破坏过许多仪器和常说落后话等许多可疑的事实，于是群众就要他坦白那些言行的动机。后来经过调查，李崇熹破坏仪器是由于个人极端自私狭隘，思想落后造成的，并没有反革命行为。杨亦周认为：像这种平常有许多令人怀疑的迹象的人，在肃反运动中被群众斗争是不可避免的。错捕也是由于类似的原因。还有一些人被捕后，因实行新的宽大措施，获得释放，于是有些人就抓住这一点来进行歪曲宣传，到处叫嚷肃反运动侵犯人权，随便捕人。应该承认，由于某些部门的有关人员的主观主义和官僚主义作风，对一些问题不加细致的分析研究，把一般政治历史问题当成反革命罪行，把落后或反动言论当作以反革命为目的的造谣破坏，或把责任事故当成政治性破坏事故，还有的是被捕的反革命分子为了企图减罪，嫁祸于人，乱检举，也有根据不完全可靠的敌伪档案材料来逮捕的，因而错捕了一些人。但是这毕竟是极少数，和整个运动的成绩比起来是微不足道的。而且这些被错捕或错斗的人，一经发觉，都得到了迅速的平反。除了立即释放，向他道歉和对周围的群众作解释以外，并且恢复他原来的工作，补发他被捕时期的工资。对问题不大而经过宽大处理被释放的人，政府还发给他生活补助费，替他安置工作，而对被斗争的“有缺点的好人”，除了公开给他作结论以外，同时还对他进行教育，帮助他改正缺点。杨亦周说，必须指出：有一些单位，对这种善后工作，处理得还不及时，这种拖拉作风已引起一些人的不满，并且使那些诬蔑肃反运动为“一团糟”的人有机可乘，这些部门应该立即扭转这种拖拉作风。
    杨亦周说：肃反运动不仅清查出许多反革命分子，擦亮了人民的眼睛，进一步巩固了人民民主专政；同时还直接帮助许多人搞清了自己的政治历史问题，博得了党和人民的信任。我们今天对党和国家的工作，能够进行公开而尖锐的批评；各个方面的事业，能够像今天这样的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，同肃反斗争的成就是分不开的，这是我们的国家从胜利走向胜利的又一保证，我们决不允许任何人诬蔑这一为国为民的正义斗争——肃反运动！
