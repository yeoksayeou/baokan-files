At the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Group Discussion
　　Long Yun and Huang Shaohong Defend Their Mistakes

    (Our dispatch) The Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang continued on the 15th. Chen Cisheng and Yu Zhenying criticized the erroneous view of negating the achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement; Zhu Yunshan and Mei Gongbin refuted the anti-socialist fallacies; Long Yun and Huang Shaohong defended their past erroneous remarks. Huang Shaohong believed that his statement that "achievements are the main aspect, and deviations and errors are individual cases has become a formula, which means exaggerating achievements and covering up errors" only had grammatical problems. Long Yun said that he admired the speeches of Zhang Bojun and others in the past because he admired their spirit, not their content. He believed that he only made the mistake of "blind admiration." These defenses were not criticized at today's symposium.
    Forty-eight people, including the Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, members of the Standing Committee, Central Committee members in Beijing, and alternate Central Committee members, attended the meeting.
    "Achievements are the main aspect, and deviations and errors are individual cases has become a formula, which will mean emphasizing achievements and covering up errors."
　　Huang Shaohong only admitted that this erroneous view of his had "grammatical errors"
    Huang Shaohong said in his speech that the statement he made at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, that "achievements are the main aspect, and deviations and errors are individual cases has become a formula, which means emphasizing achievements and covering up errors," was not wrong in any way. He only believed that "a careful examination of the wording reveals grammatical errors that may cause misunderstandings or be exploited by reactionaries."
    Huang Shaohong was quite surprised by Li Shizhang's criticism of him at the last meeting, but at the same time expressed great welcome, considering it "beneficial."
    Li Shizhang had criticized his above statement at the last meeting as reversing right and wrong. Huang Shaohong disagreed with Li Shizhang's criticism. He said that his statement was "to raise the vigilance of cadres in government departments against deviations and errors."
    Li Shizhang also criticized another view of Huang Shaohong at the last meeting, namely that Huang Shaohong believed that "two or three percent of wrong cases, on a national scale, I don't know how many families will be ruined," Li Shizhang believed that Huang Shaohong described the consequences caused by the shortcomings in the judiciary as dark, gloomy, and terrifying. Huang Shaohong defended that he did not say it was so terrible.
    Huang Shaohong also said that Li Shizhang "said that I am ‘dissatisfied with the fact that the country's economic construction has two or three percent (also hypothetical) of errors, which is a subjective idealist viewpoint’." Huang Shaohong said, of course, as a people or state worker, I hope that the government's achievements can reach 100% or even more. Otherwise, why do we shout that the Five-Year Plan should be overfulfilled? Do we very materialistically believe that the achievements are only 97 or 8 percent and not pursue progress?
　　Shao Lizi said that to criticize publicly does not equal to convicting and executing; freedom of speech does not equal to those who speak are without fault.
    Shao Lizi said that he fully agreed with Cheng Qian's speech at the last meeting. Then he said that he felt that the biggest shortcoming of some Communist Party members was that they did not maintain enough contact with the masses. Some party members unconsciously became detached from the masses, so they inevitably reflected the three evils to a greater or lesser extent in their work. The current policy of rectifying while correcting is indeed a remedy for the problem.
    Shao Lizi said that at present, the fallacies against the leadership of the Communist Party and against the socialist road have been refuted to the point of being completely devastated and revealing their true colors under the righteous voice of the masses. Some people have already lowered their heads. Those who have not lowered their heads should think carefully about where they want to go? He said that those who hold the illusion of "rotation of power" are either stupid or naive.
    Shao Lizi said that some people say: Isn't there freedom of speech? Why is there encirclement and suppression? He said that to criticize publicly does not equal to convicting and executing, the term encirclement and suppression is inappropriate; freedom of speech does not equal to those who speak are without fault, wrong words should be corrected, and major errors must be refuted sternly.
    Long Yun said that he admired the spirit of Zhang Bojun and others in their speeches in the past, and only made the mistake of "blind admiration."
    Long Yun said that his speech at the first symposium of the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was simple, which aroused criticism from non-Party members. At that time, he said that the rectification movement was different from the past, and was different from the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements. There was no need to worry, and errors could be exposed boldly. He said that he said that because he saw that the people who attended the meeting were still worried when they spoke. He said that at that meeting, he said that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements in the past were the Communist Party's rectification of people, and now the rectification movement is to rectify the shortcomings of the Communist Party. He said that later, friends made suggestions that the word "rectify" had a problem, because the Communist Party's rectification of people was to rectify bad people. He said that he was grateful for this criticism.
    Long Yun had said at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department that he admired the speeches of Zhang Bojun and others. Now, Long Yun defended that he admired the spirit of Zhang Bojun and others in taking the lead in the rectification movement, not including the content of their speeches. Long Yun said: He originally thought that Zhang Bojun's speech was based on evidence. He recently read the constitution carefully and found that Zhang Bojun's speech could not find any basis, and he knew that he had made a big mistake. Zhang Bojun's proposition was beyond the constitution and beyond the government.
　　Chen Cisheng said: The contribution of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement to the country is inestimable. We cannot hate the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement because of some mistakes.
    Chen Cisheng's speech focused on analyzing the problems left over from the suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement and the elimination of counterrevolutionaries movement, and criticized the erroneous views on this issue.
    Chen Cisheng emphasized: We cannot say "there are deviations" in general, we should look at this issue from a revolutionary standpoint.
    The environment during the suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement was: not long after liberation, some areas still had remnants of reactionary armed forces and bandits, social order was not very stable, the people's political vigilance was still very low, our army and government had not yet figured out who was good and who was bad, and counterrevolutionary activities were frequently discovered. In such a tense and volatile situation (I was working locally at that time, and the situation was indeed very tense), in order to protect the fruits of the revolution and the safety of the people, it was completely necessary to arrest, control, and investigate the following people: those who were consistently and stubbornly counterrevolutionary; those who had done espionage work in the past; those who were responsible for important responsibilities in reactionary parties, groups, armies, and governments until the eve of liberation (and did not express their intention to join the people's side); those who spread rumors and slandered the revolution. Thinking about it calmly, in that time and that environment, standing on the revolutionary position, what is the fault of suppressing these people? Some cases, which may seem inappropriate to deal with today, had to be dealt with in that way at that time.
    Regarding the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement, indeed, some places and some cadres did not implement the policy of paying attention to evidence and paying attention to investigation and research, but adopted crude methods, and some suspicious elements were wrongly criticized or wrongly punished. We admit our mistakes, and if there are mistakes, they must be corrected.
    But we must also look at this issue from a revolutionary standpoint. The hidden counterrevolutionaries are very harmful to us, and a slight negligence will lead to huge losses. In order to protect the people's construction achievements and to ensure the people's happy life, we must thoroughly eliminate the counterrevolutionaries. In order to demand a thorough elimination, we must strictly examine all suspicious elements. It is precisely because of doing this that many counterrevolutionaries have been created, and the contribution to the country and the people is inestimable. The shortcomings and errors in the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement are imperfect, and are a small loss in the huge achievements. It is wrong to hate the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement because of some shortcomings and errors.
    Some people have said that the errors in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement and the elimination of counterrevolutionaries movement are too serious, and there are as many errors as hairs on an ox, but this is not the case. (1) Those who have been criticized or punished are always unwilling and write letters of complaint everywhere. There are many letters of complaint. You have received them, he has received them, and I have received them. In fact, they are all from the same person. (2) The original punishment was not wrong, but later, due to the implementation of the lenient policy, the sentence was reduced or changed, or released early. These people thought that the previous sentence was wrong and complained everywhere. (3) Some people should have been punished at that time and in that place, but later they were released after the situation changed. These people are also calling out everywhere.
    These situations together constitute a false impression that there are many errors. It is certainly not correct to criticize the suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement and the elimination of counterrevolutionaries movement based on this false impression.
    Yu Zhenying said: There is no reason to say that the shortcomings of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement are the main aspect, and there is no reason to say that all the cases of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement have deviations.
    Yu Zhenying explained the great achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement from the completely different situations he saw during his two inspections, and criticized the erroneous remarks that negated the achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement. He said: During the first inspection in 1955, all the representatives who inspected various places saw counterrevolutionaries in the countryside who were killing, setting fires, poisoning, robbing, ... and other destructive actions, making it impossible for farmers to concentrate on production, and everyone was in danger; in factories, counterrevolutionaries were destroying machines and causing accidents; in cities, they were spreading rumors, distributing leaflets, and posting slogans, disrupting social order. The farmers and workers protested to our representatives and asked if the government was in charge, so the National People's Congress made the decision to suppress counterrevolutionaries.
    At the end of last year, I inspected Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, and this year I went to Henan and Shaanxi. In the countryside I saw, the farmers were very enthusiastic about production, the society was very stable, there was a new atmosphere of not closing doors at night and not picking up lost items. At the same time, the landlords and rich peasants, some of whom had been reformed very well and became members of the community, were all of one mind and concentrated on production; few incidents of sabotage were heard in the factories, and the workers were very focused on actively producing. These cannot be said to be the achievements of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement. It is very fair to say that this achievement is the main aspect. If the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement did not adopt a mass movement, the victory would be unimaginable. If the counterrevolutionaries were not suppressed, I think the farmers would really take up shoulder poles and the workers would take up iron bars to take direct action.
    The Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement was a mass movement, not embroidery, and deviations were inevitable. The question is whether to correct the deviations if there are any? Some deviations have been corrected, and some are being corrected. If there are any that have not been corrected, everyone should report them. There is no reason to say that the shortcomings are the main aspect, and there is no reason to think that all the cases of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movement have deviations.
　　Chen Qiyuan agreed with Li Shizhang's criticism of Huang Shaohong, pointing out that Huang Shaohong did not make a deep self-criticism
    In his speech, Chen Qiyuan first expressed his agreement with Li Shizhang's criticism of Huang Shaohong. He believed that Huang Shaohong did not make a deep self-criticism of the points Li Shizhang criticized him for in his speech today. Chen Qiyuan said that he disagreed with Huang Shaohong's views on the legal system. He pointed out that Huang Shaohong had made many speeches at the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, advocating that the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movements should be restarted from scratch, saying that every movement had great errors (not referring to the errors of a certain case). However, how many wrong cases does Huang Shaohong have in his hands? Huang Shaohong only took a few wrong cases and said that they were fundamentally wrong, and put forward the slogan of "redressing unjust verdicts." He said that judging from Huang Shaohong's many speeches, it seemed that we were lawless, and Huang Shaohong was claiming to be a protector of human rights.
    Chen Qiyuan believes that our country does not have no laws, but already has many laws. Of course, some laws are still lacking now, such as the Civil Law, Criminal Law, Civil Procedure Law, and Criminal Procedure Law. He said that if the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movements were judged according to the Kuomintang's "Complete Book of Six Laws," I don't know how many people would be killed, but fortunately we did not use the "Complete Book of Six Laws" to judge the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Movements. We do not kill those who can be killed or not, and we sentence leniently. This definitely cannot be said that we have no laws.
    Chen Qiyuan also mentioned that the day after he spoke at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a meeting, but he did not attend due to some business. Chairman Li Jishen, who presided over the meeting, read out an opinion written on a piece of paper, the general idea of which was that Chen Qiyuan's speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department was very nauseating. Chen Qiyuan said very angrily: "May I ask: What is nauseating about what I said at the United Front Work Department? I said that I work very well with Communist Party members in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and there are no walls or ditches between us. Is there anything wrong with this? Do I have to say that I oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism to not be nauseating?" He said, "Why did Chairman Li want to announce that my speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department was nauseating?" He said that the person who wrote this note was Liu Fei. After Chen Qiyuan spoke, Liu Fei explained this matter.
　　Mei Gongbin questioned: Are Zhang, Luo, and Chu a string?
　　He believes that the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should have strict measures for the issue of Guangming Daily
    Mei Gongbin said in his speech that judging from the articles and speeches recently published by Zhang Bojun, he still adopts a evasive attitude towards his mistakes. Why did Zhang Bojun not seriously treat his mistakes? This is inseparable from his consistent wavering on the socialist road. Then Mei Gongbin cited the facts recently revealed by Shi Liang, Wu Chengxi, Yang Qingyuan, and others, illustrating that Zhang Bojun was one of the main supporters of Chu Anping, his ideological essence was capitalist, and he was anti-socialist; his political attitude was opportunistic. Since Zhang Bojun's thinking is so reactionary, he cannot but play the despicable "two-faced" trick. Zhang Bojun should be warned that it is futile to try to muddle through with empty self-criticisms.
    Mei Gongbin believes that the essence of Luo Longji's anti-socialist remarks is consistent with Zhang Bojun's. Luo Longji's proposal to set up another "redress" organization by the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the same in nature as Zhang Bojun's political design institute, which is bourgeois and anti-socialist. He asked, are Zhang, Luo, and Chu a string? Are they trying to make a profit?
    Guangming Daily is the central organ of various democratic parties. The highest management organization of the newspaper is the editorial board jointly organized by the leaders of various democratic parties. The president is in charge of the newspaper affairs under the collective leadership of the editorial board. However, Zhang Bojun, who was entrusted by the editorial board to serve as the president of Guangming Daily, did not respect the collective leadership position and power of the editorial board, and acted arbitrarily, mutually entrusting with Chu Anping, guiding Guangming Daily to a terrible and dangerous road, secretly changing the clear political direction of the newspaper, and for a time became a sinful anti-Party and anti-socialist tool. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must not share the responsibility for the recent errors of Guangming Daily.
    At the same time, Mei Gongbin believes that the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should have strict measures for the issue of Guangming Daily and hold Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping accountable.
    Zhu Yunshan and Liu Fei also spoke at the meeting.

### 在民革中央小组座谈会上  龙云、黄绍竑为自己的错误辩解

　　在民革中央小组座谈会上
    龙云、黄绍竑为自己的错误辩解
    本报讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央小组扩大会议于15日继续举行。陈此生、于振瀛批判了否定肃反运动成绩的错误看法，朱蕴山、梅龚彬驳斥了反社会主义的谬论；龙云、黄绍竑对过去发表的错误言论作了辩解。黄绍竑认为他说过的“成绩是主要的，偏差错误是个别的已成为公式，这样就意味着夸大成绩，掩盖错误”这句话，只有语法上的毛病。龙云说他过去钦佩章伯钧等人的发言，是钦佩他们的精神，不包括内容。他认为他只犯了“盲目钦佩”的错误。今天的座谈会上没有对这些辩解进行批判。
    参加这次会议的有民革中央副主席、中央常委、在北京中央委员和候补中央委员四十八人。
    “成绩是主要的，偏差错误是个别的已成为公式，这会意味着强调成绩掩护错误。”
　　黄绍竑只承认他这种错误论点“有语病”
    黄绍竑发言说，5月16日他在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上说的“成绩是主要的，偏差错误是个别的已成为公式，这意味着强调成绩掩盖错误”的说法，并没有甚么错误。他只是认为，“把文字仔细检查一下，是有语病的，可能会引起误会或被反动分子所利用。”
    黄绍竑对上次会上李世璋对他的批评感到颇为惊讶，同时又表示非常欢迎，认为是“有益的”。
    李世璋在上次会上曾经批评他上述说法是颠倒是非。黄绍竑不同意李世璋的批评。他说他的那种说法是“想提高机关干部对偏差错误的警惕”。
    李世璋在上次会上还批评黄绍竑的另一种看法，即黄绍竑认为“百分之二、三的错误案件，在全国范围内不知要造成多少人家家破人亡”，李世璋认为黄绍竑把司法方面的缺点所造成的后果说得黑暗阴森，十分可怕。黄绍竑辩解说，他没有说得那样可怕。
    黄绍竑还说，李世璋“说我‘不满意国家经济建设有百分之二三（也是假定的）的错误，这是一种唯心论的观点’。”黄绍竑说，当然，作为一个人民或国家工作人员，希望政府的成绩做到百分之百或者更多一些，不然，我们为什么高呼五年计划要超额完成呢？难道我们很唯物地认定成绩只有九十七、八而不向前追求了吗？
　　邵力子说，鸣鼓而攻，不等于判罪处刑言者无罪，更不等于言者无过
    邵力子说，他完全同意上次会上程潜的发言，接着他说，他觉得有些共产党员最大的缺点就是联系群众不够。有些党员不自觉地脱离了群众，就不免把三害或多或少地反映到工作上。这次边整边改的方针，确是对症下药。
    邵力子说，目前反对共产党领导，反对社会主义道路的谬论在群众的正义呼声之下，驳斥得体无完肤，原形毕露，有些人已经低下头来。还有些没有低下头来的人，要好好地想一想，究竟要走到甚么地方去呢？他说，抱着“轮流执政”幻想的人，不是愚蠢，也是幼稚。
    邵力子说，有人说：不是言者无罪吗？怎么围剿起来？他说，鸣鼓而攻，不等于判罪处刑，围剿这个名词是不妥当的；言者无罪，更不等于言者无过，说错了的话应该纠正，犯重大错误的话更必须予以严正的驳斥。
    龙云说，他过去钦佩章伯钧等人发言的精神，只犯了“盲目钦佩”的错误
    龙云说，他在民革中央小组第一次座谈会上的发言，因为简单，引起党外人士的批评。当时他曾说，整风不同以往，与三反五反不同，用不着顾虑，可以放胆揭发错误。他说他说那话，是因为见一般参加会议的人说话还有顾虑。他说，那次会上他说过过去“三反”“五反”是共产党整人，现在整风是整掉共产党的缺点。他说，后来朋友们提意见说，“整”字有毛病，因为共产党整人是整坏人。他说他听了这批评，是感谢的。
    龙云在统战部召开的座谈会上曾经说过，他对章伯钧等人的发言表示钦佩。现在，龙云辩解说，他钦佩的是章伯钧等人在整风中起带头作用的精神，并不包括他们发言的内容。龙云说：他原来以为章伯钧的发言是有根据的，他最近仔细读了一遍宪法，才发现章伯钧的发言找不出一点根据，知道他犯了大错误，章伯钧的主张是超宪法、超政府的。
　　陈此生说：肃反对国家贡献之大莫可估计不能因为有些错误就痛恨肃反运动
    陈此生的发言，着重地分析了镇压反革命运动和肃清反革命运动遗留下来的问题，批判了对这个问题的错误看法。
    陈此生强调说：我们不能笼统地说“有偏差”，应该是站在革命的立场去看这个问题。
    进行镇反运动时的环境是：解放不久，有些地区还留存着反动武装残余和土匪，社会秩序还不很安定，人民群众的政治警惕性还很低，我们的军队和政府还没有摸清谁好谁坏，而反革命的活动又屡屡发现，在这样紧张浮动的局面中（那时我在地方工作，情况的确很紧张），为了保护革命的果实和人民的安全，把下面所说的这些人予以拘捕、管制和追查，是完全必要的，这就是：一贯顽固地反革命的；过去做特务工作的；直到解放前夕还在反动党团、军队、政府负重要责任的（又没有表明投靠人民的态度）；造谣诋毁革命的。试心平气和地想想，处在那个时候那个环境，站在革命的立场，把这等人镇一镇，压一压，又算得甚么过错呢？有些案件，在今天看来也许是不应这样处分，但在那时刻不能不这样处分。
    关于肃反运动，的确，有些地方有些干部没有贯彻注重证据、注重调查研究的方针，而采取粗暴的手段，是斗错了或处分错了一些可疑分子的。是我们错误就承认，有错误就必须纠正。
    但我们又必须站在革命的立场去看待这个问题。潜伏的反革命分子对我们的危害很大，稍一疏忽便会招致巨大的损失。为了保卫人民的建设成果，为了保证人民的幸福生活，就必须彻底地肃清反革命分子，为了要求肃得彻底，就必须严格审查一切可疑的分子。正因为这样干，就搞出了许多反革命分子，这对国家人民贡献之大是莫可估计的。肃反运动中的缺点和错误，是美中不足，是巨大成果中之一点损失。如果因为有一些缺点和错误而痛恨肃反运动是不对的。
    有人把镇反、肃反运动中的错误说得太严重了，大有错误之多多如牛毛的样子，其实并不如此。（一）被斗过或被处分过的人老不甘心，到处写信呼冤，呼冤之信甚多，你也收到，他也收到，我也收到，实际上同是一个人的呼冤；（二）原来的处分并无错误，后来因为执行宽大政策，就减轻改判或提前释放，这种人以为就是前判错误，也到处呼冤叫屈；（三）有些人在当时当地是应该予以惩戒的，后来事过境迁就把他释放了，这些人也是到处呼叫的。
    这些情况凑合起来，就构成了一种错误甚多的假象，根据这种假象去批评镇反和肃反运动，当然不会正确的。
    于振瀛说：没有理由说肃反运动缺点是主要的，没有理由说肃反的案子都有偏差
    于振瀛从他两次视察中所看到的截然不同的情况，说明肃反运动的伟大成绩，并对否定肃反成绩的错误言论作了批判。他说：1955年第一次视察，所有各地视察的代表，都看到在农村中的反革命分子，杀人，放火，放毒，抢夺，……等等破坏行动，使农民不能安心生产，人人自危；在工厂中反革命分子破坏机器，制造事故；在城市造谣，发传单贴标语，破坏了社会秩序。农民和工人向我们代表们提了抗议，问政府管不管，所以人大才作出了肃反的决定。
    去年年底我到云、贵、川视察，今年到了河南、陕西，所看到的农村，农民的生产劲头很大，社会很安定，夜不闭户，道不拾遗的新风气出现了。同时地主富农分子，有的改造的很好成了社员，大家都是一德一心的安心搞生产；工厂里也很少听到破坏事件，工人很安心的积极生产了，这些不能不说是肃反的成绩。这种成绩说它是主要的，我看非常公道。如果肃反不采取群众运动，胜利的取得是不可想像的。如果不肃反，我想农民真会拿扁担、工人要拿起铁条起来直接行动的。
    肃反是一个群众性的运动，不是绣花，偏差是在所难免的，它的问题在于有偏纠不纠？有的偏差已经纠了，有的正在纠，有没有纠的，就要大家反映出来。没有理由说缺点是主要的，没有理由认为肃反的案子都有偏差。
　　陈其瑗同意李世璋对黄绍竑的批评，指出黄绍竑没有作深刻检讨
    陈其瑗在发言中首先表示他同意李世璋对黄绍竑的批评。他认为黄绍竑今天发言时对李世璋批评他的几点没有作深刻的检讨。陈其瑗说，他不同意黄绍竑关于法制问题的看法。他指出，在全国人民代表大会常委会上，黄绍竑有好多次发言，主张把三反、五反和肃反从头来搞过，说每次运动都有很大的错误（不是指某一案件的错误）。但是，黄绍竑手中有几件错案呢？黄绍竑只拿了几件错案就说根本搞错了，就提出“平反冤狱”的口号。他说，从黄绍竑的多次发言来看，好像我们无法无天，而黄绍竑却以保障人权自居。
    陈其瑗认为，我国不是没有法，而是已经有了很多法。当然，现在还缺一些法，如民法、刑法、民事诉讼法和刑事诉讼法。他说，三反、五反、肃反，如果用国民党的“六法全书”来判罪，不知要杀多少人，但三反、五反和肃反中，幸亏我们没有拿“六法全书”来判罪。我们是对可杀可不杀的人不杀，从宽判罪。这决不能说我们没有法。
    陈其瑗还谈到，在他在中共中央统战部座谈会上发言的第二天，民革中央小组开会，他因事没有参加。主持会议的李济深主席宣读了写在一张纸条上的意见，大意是说，陈其瑗在统战部座谈会上的发言很肉麻。陈其瑗很激愤地说：“试问：我在统战部说的话有什么肉麻？我说，我在内务部和共产党员合作共事，关系很好，彼此之间没有墙、沟，这有什么不对的地方？难道我非要说反对共产党、反对社会主义才不肉麻吗？”他说，“为什么李主席要宣布我在统战部座谈会上的发言是肉麻？”他说，写这个纸条的人是刘斐。在陈其瑗发言之后，刘斐对这件事作了解释。
　　梅龚彬质问：章、罗、储是不是一串？
　　他认为民革中央对光明日报问题应有严正的措施
    梅龚彬发言说，从章伯钧最近发表的文章和言论来看，他对他的错误仍然采取躲躲闪闪的态度。章伯钧为什么没有严肃地对待他的错误呢？这同他一贯在社会主义道路上的摇摆是分不开的。接着梅龚彬举出最近史良、吴承禧、杨清源等人揭露的事实，说明章伯钧是储安平的主要支持者之一，他的思想本质是资本主义的，是反社会主义的；他的政治态度是机会主义的。章伯钧的思想既如此反动，因此就不能不耍卑鄙的“两面派”手法。应该警告章伯钧，企图用空洞检讨来蒙混搪塞是枉费心机的。
    梅龚彬认为罗隆基的反社会主义言论的本质是与章伯钧一致的。罗隆基主张由人大、政协另外成立“平反”机构和章伯钧的政治设计院性质上是一样的，是资产阶级的，反社会主义的。他问，章、罗、储是不是一串？他们是不是想捞一把？
    光明日报是各民主党派中央机关报，报社的最高管理机构有各民主党派负责人共同组织的社务委员会，社长在社务委员会集体领导下主持社务。可是受社务委员会付托担任光明日报社社长的章伯钧却没有尊重社务委员会的集体领导的地位与权力，独断专行，和储安平互相借托，把光明日报引导到可怕的危险道路上去，偷偷地改变了报纸明确的政治方向，一时竟成为罪恶的反党反社会主义的工具。对于光明日报最近时期的错误，民革中央决不能分担责任。
    同时梅龚彬认为民革中央对于光明日报问题应有严正的措置，向章伯钧、储安平追究责任。
    在会上发言的还有朱蕴山、刘斐。
