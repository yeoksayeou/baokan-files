    "Water is Grain"
     ——A Record of the Struggle of the People of the Dingxi Special District to Build Water Conservancy Projects
    By Our Correspondent Liu Bang
    Anyone who has been to Gansu knows that the most troubling problem for farmers here is drought.
    In central Gansu, from the Liupan Mountains in the east to the Wuqiaoling Mountains in the west, and from the Qinling Mountains in the south to the desert in the north, there are about 80,000 square kilometers of arid mountainous areas with altitudes ranging from 1,500 to over 2,000 meters above sea level. The annual rainfall here is only about 300 millimeters, and the forest area accounts for about 0.9% of the cultivated land. Historically, this area has been deficient in "three materials" (fodder, fertilizer, and fuel) and plagued by "five disasters" (drought, wind, sand, hail, and frost).
    However, in this very area, in 1956 alone, the total grain output of the twelve counties in the Dingxi Special District reached 2,006 million jin, an increase of 36% over 1955. Among them, the total grain output of Gaolan County reached 202.2 million jin, an increase of 83% over 1955.
  Fundamentally Change the Face of the Arid Region
    It turned out that after experiencing the drought of 1953, a serious question was raised before the local Party organizations: Should they continue to rely on passive and reactive methods such as relief and loans to help farmers muddle through? Or should they mobilize and organize the masses to carry out basic farmland water conservancy construction and fundamentally change the face of the arid and disaster-prone region? The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely chose the latter approach. In 1954, it convened a meeting on arid mountainous areas to study how to fight against natural disasters. The Dingxi Prefectural Committee also organized several investigation teams to conduct systematic and comprehensive research on the rainfall, water sources, terrain, soil, and planting area and yield of various crops in the entire district. In the end, it was concluded that the Dingxi area was capable of changing the situation of being arid and prone to disasters. Although the rainfall in the Dingxi area is relatively low, the annual rainfall is also more than 8 billion tons. If calculated at an average loss of 15%, more than 1 billion tons of rainwater are lost each year. If "surface water is not allowed to flow away in vain," by building dams, digging cellars, and repairing canals to retain sediment and store water, and develop gravity irrigation, just building 10,000 gully reservoirs can hold back 30,000 tons of rainwater, which can turn 800,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. In areas lacking surface water but with groundwater, if wells are dug, springs are tapped, and groundwater is intercepted and diverted to develop water lifting irrigation, it is estimated that 1 to 2 million mu of land can be irrigated. In addition, there are many plain and terrace farmlands in the entire special district, and ways can be found to lift and divert water from the Yellow River and the Tao River for irrigation. In areas where there is neither surface water nor groundwater, sand mulching can be used to retain soil moisture and resist drought. After these water conservancy potentials are initially tapped, a total of more than 2 million mu of irrigated and flooded land can be expanded. Changing dry land to irrigated land can increase grain production by 150 to 200 jin per mu. More importantly, on the basis of changing dry land to irrigated land, a series of production technology reforms such as "changing summer crops to autumn crops," "changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops," and "changing extensive cultivation to intensive cultivation" can also be carried out. In addition to planting trees and afforestation on non-cultivated land and cultivating grass slopes to conserve water sources, the yield of grain can be greatly stabilized and increased, fundamentally changing the poor situation of bare mountains and ridges, aridity, and disasters in the Dingxi area.
  Turning Beautiful Plans into Reality
    The Dingxi Prefectural Committee's plan to change the arid area was an inspiring call to action. From then on, a vigorous struggle to attack drought and disasters and seize happiness from nature began. By 1956, the first year of realizing agricultural cooperation in the entire special district, the struggle to change drought had achieved remarkable results. The amount of farmland water conservancy and soil and water conservation work completed in the entire district this year was more than the total amount in the previous few years before cooperation. The entire district developed 660,000 mu of irrigated land, flooded more than 250,000 mu with mountain torrents, dug more than 34,900 wells, planted 760,000 mu of trees, and built 1,651 gully dams. Soil erosion was controlled in a drainage area of 5,700 square kilometers. Adding to the previously built ones, the entire special district now has more than 1.4 million mu of irrigated land. On average, each household in the more than 500 arid townships in the entire special district already has about 1.5 mu of irrigated land. This not only contributed to last year's bumper harvest, but also provided a relatively reliable guarantee for future grain production in this area. Up to this point, the people of Dingxi Special District had achieved a preliminary but decisive victory in the struggle against drought!
    At the beginning, there was a lack of labor to dig wells and build dams, a lack of funds to build water conservancy projects, and a lack of technical personnel to carry out so many projects. However, in addition to fully estimating these practical difficulties, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee also saw another aspect of the matter—the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses and grassroots cadres. Therefore, it advocated public-private partnership and relying on the masses to do things. It organized the masses to learn by doing and cultivate technical forces. As for the lack of labor, once the masses were organized, labor would be like an inexhaustible spring. Practice has proven that this policy is correct. Of the 660,000 mu of irrigated land developed in the Dingxi Special District last year, the state only invested 450,000 yuan, an average of only 6.8 jiao per mu. The Qijiapo Township in Gaolan County mobilized its members to invest, and the cooperative returned the investment and paid interest annually. It concentrated the manpower and materials of the township. In just two months, it built a canal 15 li long with earthwork and stonework, flood control dams, stone-lined canal bottoms, and cement mortar joints, which could irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. In Huining County, which is high in the mountains and deep in the valleys, a huge sand-retaining reservoir dam suddenly appeared, 44 meters high, capable of withstanding floods of 100 cubic meters per second. In the struggle against drought, the masses in Dingxi Special District not only showed that they were tenacious, but also showed their infinite wisdom. The farmers who participated in the construction of water conservancy projects created and improved a total of 36 kinds of surveying, construction, and water lifting tools.
    Wei Shunlun, a Communist Party member and an activist in soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects, described the changes in his hometown as follows: "Perennial drought and lack of rain, difficulty in drinking water for humans and animals, and soil rising like smoke when the wind blows—this is what the Jiegaoting Township in Yuzhong County used to look like. What does Jiegaoting Township look like now? —Withered trees bloom again, springs emerge from dry gullies, barren mountains wear green clothes, and dry land becomes irrigated land." After suffering from the serious drought in 1953, Wei Shunlun responded to the call of the Party, and despite the ridicule of relatives and friends around him, blasted rocks in his hometown and dug the first well, and installed a waterwheel. He pushed a little bit and watered a little bit of land, watered a little bit and planted a little bit of crops. Now, there are hundreds of wells and dozens of waterwheels in the entire township, turning hundreds of mu of dry land into irrigated land. The yield of summer fields per mu has increased by 150 jin compared to before. In addition, because there is water, these lands can also grow more ratooning crops, and each mu of autumn fields can harvest about 500 jin. Because there is water, the more than 100 old fruit trees in the township that would not bloom due to drought are now blooming and bearing fruit, and can harvest 200 loads of fruit a year (one load is about 150 jin). In 1953, Sanchagou in Yuzhong County was still bare. Since closing the mountains for afforestation, a mountain ridge 15 li long and 10 li wide has grown elm trees and Chinese toon trees, and it looks like a dense young forest from a distance. The most gratifying thing is that springs have emerged again from the afforested mountain ridges. Now the masses have personally seen that the Party's words "afforestation can conserve water sources and change drought" have become a vivid reality, and their enthusiasm for work has become even greater. In the past three or four years, Jiegaoting Township has transformed from a grain-deficient township into a prosperous township with surplus grain for sale.
    Continue the Struggle Against Drought
    Last winter and this spring, the rainfall and snowfall in this arid mountainous area of ​​central Gansu has been particularly scarce again, and drought has occurred in many places. However, people are no longer as panicked and helpless as before, but bravely, optimistically, and actively fighting against the drought. The leaders of the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China told me: "Our 1.4 million mu of irrigated land were all built under the pressure of drought. This year, the entire special district originally planned to build 200,000 mu of irrigated land and flood 400,000 mu of land with floodwaters. If the drought is severe, then it will definitely urge them to complete this year's task of increasing the construction of irrigated land ahead of schedule and exceeding the target."

    “水就是粮食”
     ——记定西专区人民兴修水利的斗争
    本报记者　柳梆
    到过甘肃的人谁都知道这里农民最苦恼的问题就是干旱。
    甘肃中部东起六盘山，西到乌鞘岭，南起秦岭，北迄沙漠。这块地方，约有八万平方公里的地方都是拔海一千五百到二千多公尺的干旱山区。这里年降雨量仅三百公厘左右，森林面积约占耕地的0.9％。这是历史上一个“三料”（饲料、肥料、燃料）都缺，“五灾”（旱灾、风灾、沙灾、雹灾、霜灾）俱全的地方。
    然而就在这个地方，1956年，光是定西专区十二个县，粮食的总产量就达到二十亿零六千多万斤，比1955年增产36％。其中，皋兰县的粮食总产量达到二亿零二百多万斤，比1955年增产83％。
  从根本上改变干旱区的面貌
    原来，在经历了1953年那次旱灾以后，一个严重的问题提到了当地党组织的面前：是继续用救济、贷款等消极被动的办法拉扯着农民得过且过呢？还是动员和组织群众进行农田水利基本建设，从根本上改变干旱多灾的面貌呢？中共甘肃省委坚决选择了后一种措施，在1954年召开了干旱山区会议，着手研究怎样同自然灾害作斗争。定西地委也组织了几个调查组，对全区的雨量、水源、地形、土壤、各种作物的播种面积和收获量等作了系统全面的调查研究。最后，认为定西地区是能够改变干旱多灾的局面的。定西地区的雨量虽然较少，但是全年雨水也有八十多亿吨。如果以平均流失15％计算，每年即流失十多亿吨雨水。如果“不让地面水白流”，筑坝、挖窖、修渠，拦砂蓄水，发展自流灌溉，只要修筑一万个沟壑蓄水坝，就能拦住三万吨雨水，可变八十万亩旱地为水地。在缺乏地面水而有地下水的地方，如果打井、掏泉、截引地下水，发展提水灌溉，初步估计可以灌溉一百万到二百万亩地。此外，全专区还有不少川原高台耕地，可以设法提引黄河和洮河的水灌溉。在既无地面水也缺地下水的地方，可以采用铺砂保墒抗旱的办法。这些水利潜力初步挖掘出来以后，总共可以扩大水浇地、水漫地二百多万亩。旱地改水地，每亩能够增产粮食一百五十到二百斤。更重要的是在旱地改水地的基础上，还可以进行“改夏禾为秋禾”，“改低产作物为高产作物”，“改粗耕为细耕”等一系列的生产技术改革。加上在非耕地植树造林，培护草坡等工作，涵养水源，就可以大大地稳定和提高粮食的产量，从根本上改变定西地区光山秃岭干旱多灾的贫困局面。
  把美好的计划变为现实
    定西地委改变干旱区的计划，是一声振奋人心的号角，从此，一场轰轰烈烈的向干旱灾害进攻，向大自然夺取幸福的斗争开始了。到了1956年，全专区实现农业合作化的第一年，改变干旱的斗争就收到显著的成效。这一年全区完成农田水利和水土保持的工作量，比合作化前几年的总和还要多。全区共发展水地六十六万亩，引山洪漫地二十五万多亩，打井三万四千九百多眼，植树造林七十六万亩，沟壑打坝一千六百五十一座，有五千七百平方公里的流域面积控制了水土流失。加上从前修的，现在全专区共有水地一百四十多万亩。全专区五百多个干旱乡平均每户已有一亩五分左右的水地。这就不仅促成了去年的大丰收，而且也使得这个地方今后的粮食产量有了比较可靠的保证。至此，定西专区的人民在同干旱的斗争中，已经获得了初步的、但是却具有决定意义的胜利！
    开始，打井筑坝缺乏劳动力，兴修水利没有资金，搞这么多的工程也缺乏技术人材。但是，定西地委除了充分估计到这些实际的困难以外，还看到事情的另一个方面——广大群众和基层干部的积极性和创造性，因而提倡民办公助，依靠群众办事；组织群众边做边学，培养技术力量；至于说缺乏劳动力，一旦群众组织起来劳动力就会像不竭的泉水。实践证明这个方针是正确的。定西专区去年完成的灌溉六十六万亩水地的水利工程中，国家只投资四十五万元，每亩平均只摊六角八分。皋兰县祁家坡乡用动员社员投资，由社逐年归还和贴息的办法，集中了本乡的人力物力，只两个月的时间，修好了有土方石方，有拦洪坝防洪坝，有块石衬砌渠底，有水泥浆勾缝，长达十五华里，可以浇地一万多亩的渠道一条。在山高壑深的会宁县，一下子就出现了四十四公尺高，可以顶住一百秒立方公尺洪水的巨大的拦沙蓄水坝。定西专区群众在同干旱斗争中不仅表现了他们是顽强的，而且也显示了他们有无穷的智慧。参加兴修水利的农民，一共创造和改进了各种测量、施工以及提水工具三十六种。
    水土保持和水利工程中的积极分子共产党员魏顺伦是这样描绘他的家乡的变化的：“常年干旱缺雨，人畜饮水困难，大风一来土像烟一样冒起来，这是从前的榆中县接官亭乡的面貌。如今的接官亭乡呢？——枯树重开花，干沟出泉水，荒山穿绿衣，旱地变水地。”遭受过1953年严重旱灾以后的魏顺伦，响应党的号召，不顾周围亲朋戚友的冷嘲热讽，在他的家乡的土地上炸开了石头，挖了第一口井，安上了水车。自己一个人推一点浇一点地，浇一点种一点庄稼。现在，全乡已有百数十眼水井，安了几十部水车，使几百亩旱地变成了水地。每亩夏田比原来增产一百五十斤。此外，因为有了水，这些地还可以增种回槎，每亩秋田可以收五百斤左右。因为有了水，乡上原有一百多棵受旱不会开花的老果树现在也开花结果了，一年能收果子二百驮（一驮约一百五十斤）。1953年榆中县的三岔沟，还是光秃秃的，自从封山育林以来，现在已经有十五里长、十里宽的山岗长起了榆树和椿树，远看去是一片密扎扎的幼林。最叫人高兴的是已经绿化了的山岗，一个个枯泉又出水了。这下子群众亲眼见到党说的“植树造林可以涵养水源改变干旱”的话成为活生生的事实，干的劲头更足了。三、四年来，接官亭乡从一个缺粮乡变成一个有余粮出卖的富裕乡。
    再接再厉同旱象斗争
    去冬和今春，甘肃中部这片干旱山区雨雪又显得特别稀少，不少地方已经发生了旱象。然而人们已经不像从前那样心慌意乱束手无策，而是勇敢、乐观、积极地去同旱象搏斗。中共定西地委的领导人对我说：“我们的一百几十万亩水地都是在旱灾的逼迫下修出来的。今年全专区原计划修水地二十万亩，洪水漫地四十万亩；如果旱象严重，那末，它一定会督促他们提前超额地完成今年增修水地的任务。”
