Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: San Francisco dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech entitled "Our Policy Toward Chinese Communism" at the Lions Club International Association International Conference in San Francisco on June 28th, once again nakedly expressing that the U.S. government will unswervingly implement its consistently hostile policy towards the People's China.

Dulles said that the United States has never diplomatically recognized China, has always opposed China's entry into the United Nations, and has never engaged in trade or cultural exchanges with China. Dulles said, "These have been, and still are, our policies."

Dulles openly declared in his speech that the basis of the U.S. policy toward China is that "Communist rule" in China "is a passing, not a permanent phenomenon." Dulles believes that the U.S. government's responsibility is to "do everything possible to make this phenomenon disappear."

Dulles quoted recent rightist remarks in China to support his illusion. He said that a university lecturer in China said "brave words": "Overthrowing the Communist Party cannot be said to be unpatriotic, because the Communists do not serve the people."

Dulles especially pinned his hopes on the so-called "individualists" in China to realize the task of making so-called Communist rule "disappear."

Dulles said that if the establishment of diplomatic relations, trade, and cultural exchanges between the United States and China, and China's entry into the United Nations could promote the "disappearance" of Communism in China, the United States would do so. However, he emphasized that under the current circumstances, neither recognition, trade, nor cultural relations, nor all three combined, would favorably influence the development of the situation in China towards the goals the United States expects.

Dulles also talked about the various reasons why the United States is unwilling to recognize China at present in his speech. He said that if recognition were granted, some "Chinese on the mainland who want to change the nature of their government would be greatly frustrated." He said that recognizing China would also make overseas Chinese no longer count on Chiang Kai-shek, would inflict a "violent blow" on the Chiang Kai-shek group, and would weaken "Free Asia's resistance to Chinese Communism."

Dulles said that if the United States were to recognize China, it might enable China to obtain its seat in the United Nations, which is "incompatible with the interests of both the United States and the United Nations." He believes that the Soviet Union, which possesses the power of veto, has already "seriously limited" the ability of the United Nations to act, and if China also becomes a permanent member of the Security Council with the power of veto, he fears that it would sow the so-called "seeds of destruction" for the United Nations.

Dulles said that no matter what others do, the United States, which "bears significant security obligations in the China region," should not strengthen the military strength of its "potential enemy" through trade. He also said that China is very eager to conduct cultural exchanges with the United States, but he expressed concern that once the United States agrees to do so, China's neighbors will follow suit.

Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: Reuters reported from Washington: U.S. government officials believe that Dulles's speech on China policy in San Francisco was aimed at "countering the growing and apparently heavy pressure at home demanding a change in this policy."

These officials said that because some people in Congress and elsewhere have criticized the United States and its allies for not being in step, this speech was mainly written and delivered for domestic consumption.

### 杜勒斯又在咬牙切齿  美国不改变敌视中国的政策  并引用了我国右派言论来支持他的幻想

　　杜勒斯又在咬牙切齿
    美国不改变敌视中国的政策
    并引用了我国右派言论来支持他的幻想
    新华社29日讯　旧金山消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯6月28日在旧金山的狮子俱乐部国际协会国际大会上，以“我们对中国共产主义的政策”为题发表演说，又一次赤裸裸地表示美国政府将坚持不变地执行它一贯敌视人民中国的政策。
    杜勒斯说，美国一直没有在外交上承认中国，一直反对中国进入联合国，一直没有同中国进行贸易或者文化上的交流。杜勒斯说，“这些过去一直是，而且现在也是我们的政策”。
    杜勒斯在演说里公然宣称，美国对华政策的依据是：“共产主义的统治”在中国“是一种要消逝的、而不是一种永久的现象”。杜勒斯认为，美国政府的责任就是要“尽一切可能使这种现象消逝”。
    杜勒斯引用中国近来出现的右派言论，来支持他的这种幻想。他说，在中国有一位大学讲师说了“勇敢的话”：“推翻共产党不能说是不爱国，因为共产党人不为人民服务。”
    杜勒斯特别瞩望于他所谓的中国的“个人主义者”来实现使所谓共产主义统治“消逝”的工作。
    杜勒斯说，如果美国同中国建立外交关系、进行贸易和文化交流、让中国进入联合国能够促使中国的共产主义“消逝”的话，美国就会这样做。但是，他强调说，在目前情况下，无论承认、贸易或者文化关系以及所有这三者都不会有利地影响中国的事态向美国所期望的目标演变。
    杜勒斯在演说里还讲到美国不愿意在目前承认中国的种种理由。他说，如果承认的话，在大陆上的一些“想改变他们的政府的性质的中国人会大大地受到挫折”。他说，承认中国还会使居住在海外的华侨不再指望蒋介石，会使蒋介石集团受到“猛烈的打击”，并且会削弱“自由亚洲对中国共产主义的抵抗”。
    杜勒斯说，美国如果承认中国，就有可能使中国得到它在联合国里的席位，而这是“既不符合美国也不符合联合国的利益的”。他认为保有否决权的苏联已经“严重地限制了”联合国的活动能力，如果中国也成为安全理事会的一个拥有否决权的常任理事国的话，他恐怕会给联合国种下所谓“毁灭的种子”。
    杜勒斯说，不管别人怎么样，在“中国地区负有重大安全义务”的美国不应当通过贸易来加强它的“潜在敌人”的军事力量。他还说，中国是很希望同美国进行文化交流的，不过他表示担心，一旦美国同意这样做，中国的近邻也会跟着这样做。
    据新华社29日讯　路透社从华盛顿报道说：美国政府官员认为，杜勒斯在旧金山发表对华政策演说的目的是“为了抵制国内要求改变这一政策的日益增长的明显的沉重压力”。
    这些官员们说，由于国会和其它地方某些人士纷纷批评美国和它的盟国步调走得不一致，所以这篇演说主要是为国内而写而发表的。
