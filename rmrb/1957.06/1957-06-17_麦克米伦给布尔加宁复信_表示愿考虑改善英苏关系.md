Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. The British Prime Minister's Office announced on June 15th a reply letter from Macmillan to Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. This letter is Macmillan's response to Bulganin's letter to Macmillan on April 20th of this year. In that letter, Bulganin put forward some opinions and suggestions on easing international tensions and improving Anglo-Soviet relations.

In his reply, Macmillan said that the British government is in favor of expanding Anglo-Soviet trade and welcomes increasing the volume and variety of goods that can currently be traded. The British government also favors increasing Anglo-Soviet contact and cultural exchanges organized through representatives and responsible channels. Macmillan welcomed the steps recently taken by the Soviet Union to promote such exchanges, including changing exchange rates to promote visits to the Soviet Union.

Macmillan said that after fully studying all the issues raised in his and Bulganin's correspondence, he believes that "the issue most in need of progress is the reduction of conventional and nuclear armaments." Although the British Prime Minister spoke of "the principle of phased disarmament," he said that the "key" to this issue lies in reaching international agreement on the reduction of both conventional and nuclear armaments. He also specifically emphasized the "supervisory system" for "testing and verifying" such agreements.

Macmillan reiterated the proposal for advance registration of nuclear explosion tests. He also said that on the issue of the level of armed forces of major powers, the UK could not support "very extensive reductions" if it "cannot be certain that it will also be resolved politically." The British Prime Minister also said he welcomed Bulganin's "more benevolent attitude" on the issue of "aerial inspection," and said the Soviet proposals on this issue were being "studied."

Macmillan sought to shift the responsibility for the division of Europe caused by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. He also said that the British government could not accept the Soviet proposal for a European collective security treaty, or a non-aggression pact between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. He reiterated that the issue of European security depends on the solution of the German question.

Macmillan also said that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy in the Middle East that is "detrimental to British interests," and that the current policies of the Hungarian government, as well as the attitude of the Soviet and Hungarian governments against the UN General Assembly's resolutions interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, "will inevitably continue to be a serious obstacle to improving Anglo-Soviet relations." However, he expressed "continued willingness to consider ways to improve Anglo-Soviet relations."

### 麦克米伦给布尔加宁复信  表示愿考虑改善英苏关系

　　麦克米伦给布尔加宁复信
　　表示愿考虑改善英苏关系
    据新华社16日讯　英国首相官邸6月15日公布麦克米伦在写给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的一封复信。这封信是麦克米伦对布尔加宁在今年4月20日给麦克米伦的信件的答复。布尔加宁在那封信中曾经就缓和国际紧张局势和改善英苏关系问题提出了一些意见和建议。
    麦克米伦在复信中说，英国政府赞成扩大英苏贸易，欢迎增加那些目前可以进行贸易的商品的贸易量和贸易品种。英国政府也赞成增加通过代表和负责途径组织的英苏接触和文化交流。麦克米伦表示欢迎苏联为了促进这种交流而在最近采取的步骤，其中包括改变汇率来促进对苏联的访问。
    麦克米伦说，在充分研究了他和布尔加宁信件来往中所提出的一切问题以后，他认为“最需要取得进展的问题是常规军备和核军备的裁减的问题”。英国首相虽然谈到“分期实现裁军的原则”，可是他说，这个问题的“关键”在于在常规军备和核军备的裁减方面都达成国际协议。他还特别强调“考验和审查”这种协议的“监督制度”。
    麦克米伦重新提出原子核爆炸试验的预先登记建议。他还说，关于大国武装部队水平问题，如果英国“不能肯定在政治方面同时也予以解决”，就不能支持“进行非常广泛的削减”。英国首相又说，他欢迎布尔加宁在“空中视察”问题上采取的“比较善意的态度”，他说，苏联关于这个问题的建议正在“加以研究”。
    麦克米伦力图把北大西洋集团组织使欧洲陷于分裂的责任转嫁到苏联和东欧国家身上。他还说，英国政府不能接受苏联关于欧洲集体安全条约的建议，或者北大西洋集团和华沙条约成员国之间签订一项互不侵犯协定的建议。他重申欧洲安全问题取决于德国问题的解决。
    麦克米伦还说，苏联在中东奉行着一项对英国“利益有害的政策”，而且目前匈牙利政府的政策以及苏联和匈牙利政府反对联合国大会干涉匈牙利内政的决议的态度，“必定会继续成为改善英苏关系的严重障碍”。但是，他表示“仍然愿意考虑改善英苏关系的方法”。
