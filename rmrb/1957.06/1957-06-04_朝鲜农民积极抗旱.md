Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 3rd. Today's "Democratic Korea" published an editorial calling on Korean farmers to mobilize and utilize all forces and all water sources to overcome the drought. There has been very little rainfall in northern Korea this spring, and farmers everywhere are actively engaged in the fight against drought.

The government of the Republic has invested in the construction and restoration of many water conservancy and irrigation projects since the war. At present, 80% of the paddy fields in northern Korea can be irrigated, which is very helpful in preventing drought. This spring, farmers were organized to vigorously fight drought, supplying more than 200 water pumps, as well as many pumping equipment and materials.

    朝鲜农民积极抗旱
    据新华社平壤3日电　今天的“民主朝鲜报”发表社论，号召朝鲜农民动员和利用一切力量和一切水源战胜旱灾。今春朝鲜北部雨量很少，目前各地农民正在积极展开抗旱斗争。
    共和国政府在战后投资兴修和恢复了许多水利灌溉工程，目前朝鲜北部80％的水田能够引水灌溉，对于防止旱灾很有作用。今春又组织农民大力抗旱，供应二百多部抽水机以及许多抽水设备和器材。
