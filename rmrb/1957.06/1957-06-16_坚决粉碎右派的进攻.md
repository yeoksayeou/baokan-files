Resolutely Crush the Rightists' Attack
　　Chengdu Five Thousand Workers Hold Anti-Rightist Rally
　　(Our dispatch from Chengdu, June 15th) Five thousand worker activists in Chengdu gathered on the 14th, calling on all workers in the city to unite around the Party and resolutely repel the attack of the Rightist elements.
　　National model worker and construction worker, Lin Ruiting, pointed out that Han Wenwei, Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League's Sichuan Provincial Committee, said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "bold suspicion" by some, arbitrary detention and insult of citizens, and a sense of panic that "everyone can be arrested and no one is guaranteed." However, we have personally witnessed the significant victory of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Some hidden counter-revolutionary elements confessed and surrendered themselves, and some people with political and historical burdens got rid of their burdens, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthening the unity within the people. Why can't these facts be seen? To say that suppressing counter-revolutionary elements is "wronging people" and to lodge serious protests with the Party and government, isn't this opposing the people's democratic dictatorship?
　　Mo Huaigui, a worker from the Minkang Dyeing Factory, refuted the remarks made by Li Zhongping, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, attacking the promotion of public representatives from workers. Mo Huaigui said that the public representative in our factory was promoted from among the workers. After the joint venture, the factory improved its management and developed production. What's wrong with promoting public representatives from workers? He also pointed out that it is not true that Li Zhongping said there was no encouragement for private personnel's enthusiasm. He said that the capitalist Zhu Hongxiang of this factory is the deputy director and was rated as a special advanced producer of the factory last year and a second-class model worker of the city this year. Last year, forty-two private personnel in the city were rated as advanced production workers of the city, but Li Zhongping turned a blind eye to these facts.
　　In his speech, worker Zheng Xing denounced the reactionary remarks of Gao Xingya, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Counselor's Office, who described those who support the Communist Party as "nine thousand year olds" and "ass-kissers." Zheng Xing said that this statement is as vicious as the means used by those who sent threatening letters to Lu Yuwen. We must resolutely strike back at this reactionary statement.
　　Demobilized Soldiers Call to Defend the Fruits of the Revolution
　　(Dispatch from this newspaper) More than ninety workers from the state-owned Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, who were formerly soldiers, shouted the slogans "Resolutely uphold the leadership of the Party!" and "Resolutely defend socialist construction!" last night (June 14th) during a forum to refute various anti-socialist fallacies.
　　The demobilized and transferred servicemen in this factory, some of whom participated in the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, and some of whom participated in the Battle of Shangganling in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. They shed blood on the battlefield and are now sweating by the machine tools. They know what many comrades bravely sacrificed for and what they are diligently building for today. Therefore, when they heard various anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist absurdities, they were extremely indignant and repeatedly requested a meeting to condemn them.
　　Old Red Army soldier Liu Desheng participated in the revolutionary wars from the Long March to the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. He said that he has seen a lot and knows how the fruits of victory were obtained. He will never allow bad elements to sabotage socialism. He said that during the Long March, when crossing the grasslands, there was nothing to eat, and everyone was so hungry that they had to eat leather belts, leather shoes, tree bark, and grass roots, and some even ate the cotton from their clothes... During the War of Resistance, many soldiers fought during the day and transferred at night. When sleeping, they couldn't even untie their leggings. Over time, the flesh on their legs changed color and rotted. Liu Desheng said: "What did these comrades suffer for! Wasn't it for everyone to live a happy life! For the revolution!"
　　Worker Lin Luzi said that he was very angry after reading Zhang Bojun's speech. He said that Zhang Bojun clearly wanted to pull the revolution backward. We must warn Zhang Bojun that he should follow the path pointed out to him by Shi Liang, otherwise, the times will abandon him.
　　Bai Wanpu, a doctor in the clinic, was originally a military doctor in the People's Liberation Army. He said, I personally witnessed many Communist Party members sacrificing their lives to liberate all the people of the country. In the battle to liberate Hainan Island, our battalion contained three divisions of the Kuomintang army. We fought a bloody battle with the Chiang bandit army at Height 105 for several days and nights. Only fifteen soldiers were left in the entire battalion. Hundreds of people, including the battalion commander and company commander, sacrificed themselves. Seventy percent of the commanders and fighters in this battalion were Communist Party members. They charged ahead and retreated last, truly worthy of the glorious title of Communist Party member. Bai Wanpu said that people like Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou said that Communist Party members "do all kinds of evil" and are "plainclothes police." I want to ask them: what position are you speaking from?
　　Trade union cadre Wei Zhongji said, I disagree with Chu Anping's statement of "Party's world." Aren't there many non-Party members in the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, the highest organs of state power? Even newspapers, there are many non-Party newspapers, such as Ta Kung Pao, Wen Hui Pao, Guangming Daily... If it were really the "Party's world," would Guangming Daily exist? Would Chu Anping be made the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily?
　　Agricultural Labor Model Painfully Refutes Ge Peiqi
　　(Dispatch from this newspaper) Wang Guofan, Director of the Jianming Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei, wrote to this newspaper, saying: Ge Peiqi said that the only people whose lives have improved are the Party members and cadres who used to wear torn shoes and now ride in small cars. This is not in line with reality. Take the village where I live, for example. Before liberation, out of the 150 households in the village, 108 relied on begging or working for others. Even more people ate tree bark and bran. Several people even starved to death in the village. After liberation, the Communist Party led us to organize mutual aid teams and establish cooperatives, and life got better. Even those who couldn't afford cotton clothes in the coldest days of winter and had to squat in the corner to bask in the sun now have single clothes in summer and cotton clothes in winter. 社員 Wang Rong, before liberation, the whole family of six covered themselves with one quilt, which they used for thirty years; now each family member has a set of bedding. Those who used to rely on begging now have surplus grain. Before liberation, no family had grain to sell. Last year, the whole cooperative sold 150,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. These facts show whether the lives of the masses have improved or worsened?
　　Ge Peiqi said: If the Communist Party dies, China will not die; even without the leadership of the Communist Party, others will not sell the country. Here, I won't talk about grand principles, only about our lives. If there were no Communist Party, we would not have such a prosperous life; if there were no Communist Party, we would have frozen and starved to death long ago. We cannot live without the Communist Party.
　　Ge Peiqi may not believe this. Then he should come to our cooperative to take a look, ask our members how they lived in the past, and see how they live now. If he is not deliberately opposed to socialism, he should slap himself hard in the face.

　　坚决粉碎右派的进攻
　　成都五千工人举行反右派大会
    本报成都15日电　成都市五千工人积极分子14日集会，号召全市工人团结在党的周围，坚决击退右派分子的进攻。
    全国劳模、建筑工人林瑞廷指出，民盟四川省常委韩文畦说肃反是部分人“大胆怀疑”，擅行扣押和侮辱公民，“人人皆有被捕、自身毫无保障”的惶恐。可是，我们亲眼看见肃反运动取得了重大胜利。有些潜伏的反革命分子坦白自首，有些有政治历史包袱的人丢了包袱。巩固了人民民主专政，加强了人民内部团结。为什么看不见这些事实呢？说镇压反革命分子是“冤枉人”，向党和政府提出严重抗议，试问这不是反对人民民主专政吗？
    民康染厂工人莫怀贵驳斥了四川省工商联副秘书长李仲平攻击从工人中提拔公方代表的言论。莫怀贵说，我们厂的公方代表就是从工人中提拔的。这个厂合营后改善了企业管理，发展了生产，从工人中提拔公方代表有什么不好？他并指出李仲平说没有鼓励私方人员热情也不是事实。他说这个厂资方朱宏祥是副厂长，去年被评为厂的特等先进生产者，今年被评为市的二等劳模。去年全市有四十二名私方人员被评为市的先进生产工作者，李仲平却看不见这些事实。
    工人郑兴讲话中斥责了四川省参事室主任高兴亚把拥护共产党的人士说成是“九千岁”、“舐屁股”的反动言论。郑兴说这种说法跟给卢郁文寄恐吓信的人的手段一样毒辣。必须坚决痛击这种反动言论。
　　复员军人号召保卫革命果实
    本报讯　国营北京广播器材厂九十多个战士出身的工人，昨（14日）晚在举行座谈会驳斥各种反社会主义谬论的时候，喊出：“坚决维护党的领导！”“坚决保卫社会主义建设！”的口号。
    这个厂的复员转业军人，有的参加过长征、抗日战争、解放战争，有的在抗美援朝战争中参加过上甘岭战役。他们在战场上流过血，现在正在机床边流着汗。他们知道很多战友英勇牺牲是为了什么，知道自己今天辛勤建设是为了什么，所以当听到各种反党、反人民、反社会主义怪论的时候，万分愤慨，几次要求开会痛斥。
    老红军战士刘德胜参加过从长征到抗美援朝的革命战争。他说，他看的事情很多，他知道胜利果实是怎样得来的，他绝不允许坏分子破坏社会主义。他说，长征时候过草地，什么吃的都没了，大家饿的没法子，就吃皮带、皮鞋、树皮、草根，有的就吃衣服里的棉花……抗战时候很多战士白天打仗，晚上转移，睡觉时候连裹腿都不能打开，日子久了，腿上的肉就变色了、烂了。刘德胜说：“这些同志吃这些苦为的是什么呀！还不是为了大伙过幸福日子！为了革命！”
    工人林露滋说，他看了章伯钧的发言很气愤。他说，章伯钧分明是想把革命往后拉。我们要警告章伯钧，他应照着史良指给他的路走，不然的话，时代会把他抛弃的。
    医务所医生白万普原来是解放军的军医。他说，我亲眼看到许多共产党员为了解放全国人民，不惜牺牲自己的生命。解放海南岛之役，我们一个营箝制住国民党军三个师，在一○五高地和蒋匪军血战几天几夜，一个营只剩下十五个战士。几百个人，包括营长、连长都牺牲了。这个营的指战员有百分之七十都是共产党员。他们冲锋在前，退却在后，真不愧共产党员这个光荣称号。白万普说，葛佩琦、王德周之流说共产党员“无恶不作”，是“便衣警察”，我要问问他们：你们是站在什么立场上说话呀？
    工会干部魏忠吉说，我不同意储安平“党天下”的说法。在国家最高权力机关的人民代表大会和常委会里，不是有许多非党人士吗？就是报纸，也有不少非党报纸，像大公报、文汇报、光明日报……假如真是“党天下”，能叫光明日报存在吗？能要储安平作光明日报总编辑吗？
　　农业劳动模范痛驳葛佩琦
    本报讯　河北遵化县建明农林牧合作社主任王国藩给本报来信说：葛佩琦说现在生活提高的只是过去穿破鞋、今天坐小卧车的党员和干部。这不符合实际。拿我住的村子来说，解放前，全村一百五十户中，就有一百零八户靠要饭或给人家做工过日子。吃树皮、吃麸皮的人更多。村里还饿死了好几个人。解放后，共产党领导我们组织互助组，成立合作社，日子就好起来了。连过去数九天穿不上棉衣，只得蹲在墙角晒太阳的人，现在夏季有单衣、冬天有棉衣了。社员王荣，解放前全家六口人盖一床被子，一直盖了三十年；现在全家每人有一套被褥。靠要饭吃的人，现在也都有了余粮。解放前，谁家也没有粮食卖，去年全社卖给国家余粮十五万斤。这些事实，说明群众生活是好了还是坏了？
    葛佩琦说：共产党亡了，中国不会亡；不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国。这里不说大道理，只从我们的生活来说，要是没有共产党，我们就不会有这样富裕的生活；要是没有共产党，我们早就冻死饿死了。我们不能没有共产党。
    这样说，葛佩琦可能不相信。那末他到我们社里来看看，问问我们的社员过去是怎样生活的，看看现在是怎样生活的。如果他不是存心反对社会主义的话，他就应该狠狠地打自己的嘴巴子。
