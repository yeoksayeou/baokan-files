    Wuhan Workers and Industrialists and Businessmen Argue and Reason Together
    (Our Dispatch) According to the Changjiang Daily: "The industrialists and businessmen have talked about their opinions, and our workers should also argue and reason with them." This was the unanimous call of the old workers of the Wuhan public-private joint ventures who attended the symposium. This meeting was convened by the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions on the afternoon of the 28th.
      Without the leadership of the Party and the working class, could China's bourgeoisie have made such great achievements?
    Many workers present at the meeting expressed great dissatisfaction with the recent statements in the newspapers that negated all work achievements. Ye Lihu, a worker at the Wuhan Metallurgical Plant, said excitedly: "Some industrialists and businessmen say that the Communist Party leads everything, and if the leadership has no achievements, it should be responsible for everything. This statement does not conform to the facts. Not to mention big things, take our factory as an example. It was merged from six dilapidated small factories. Before the public-private partnership, each furnace took 24 hours to produce only 4,000 catties of molten iron. After the partnership, with the leadership of the Party and the active efforts of the workers to improve production, now each furnace only takes 8 hours, and the molten iron output reaches 8,000 catties. The working hours are reduced by two-thirds, and the output is doubled. Isn't this an achievement of the Party's leadership?" Xiao Defu, a worker at the Jianghan Printing Factory, said: "Some people only say that the working class is not good, and the Party's leadership is not good either. May I ask who built the Yangtze River Bridge and the Wuhan Iron and Steel? Without the leadership of the Party and the hard work of the working class, could the Chinese bourgeoisie have achieved such great projects?"
    Calculating the exploitation accounts, what reason is there to demand that fixed interest be extended to twenty years?
    "Should the fixed interest be extended to twenty years?" This was the most hotly debated issue at the meeting. Hu Xingyi, a clerk at the Zhicheng Cloth Store, said that some industrialists and businessmen agree with Li Kangnian's opinion in Shanghai. I want to ask them what reason they have to advocate that the fixed interest should be extended for twenty years? Take Zhicheng Cloth Store as an example. When it opened in 1930, the share capital was 10,000 silver dollars. After repairing the house, only four to five thousand yuan were left. In 1934, the capitalists competed with others for the market, losing all 10,000 yuan of capital and owing more than 100,000 yuan in debt, agreeing to pay back the creditors in installments year by year. This money was all used to repay the debt by exploiting us workers in the following years. In 1946, the capitalist pieced together 1,000 yuan to resume business, but by relying on speculation and exploitation of workers, they made a fortune within a few years, earning more than 60,000 yuan. The capitalists not only ate and drank extravagantly, but also extracted 450 taels of gold to invest in the Yongda Cloth Store. After liberation, the business encountered difficulties, and we voluntarily reduced our salaries four times to overcome the difficulties and maintain business. The monthly salary was reduced from 5,500 yuan to more than 3,500 yuan. In this way, the enterprise was maintained. In the past two years, the workers received 24,000 yuan less in wages. After the public-private partnership, the fixed interest for the capitalists was 14,000 yuan. This money is not even enough to repay the wages we reduced. What reason is there to say that the fixed interest should be twenty years? Not only do we workers oppose this view, but even Liu Yuquan, a private sector employee in my store, does not agree with it. He is willing to cut off his tail and transform himself into a self-reliant worker. It seems that the vast majority of capitalists are willing to have a fixed interest of seven years, and only a few people agree to a fixed interest of twenty years. Song Zhenlai of the Wuhan Foundry Factory said: Twenty years later, our country will have built socialism. Advocating a fixed interest of twenty years means continuing to exploit after the establishment of a socialist society. In fact, this advocacy is to delay socialist construction. He cited his own experience to illustrate this point: I used to work in the Wanli Sand Casting Factory. When it opened, the capitalist Zhang Xinchun only had a small house, and all the money he earned each year went into his pocket. In 1952, the assessed capital was more than 8,000 yuan, and he got 5,400 yuan from the four-horse split, and another 1,000 yuan after the public-private partnership. If he wants to extend the fixed interest on this capital for twenty years, it is not redemption, but "making huge profits from a small investment and being greedy without end." Liu Yunjie, a worker in the inn industry, said: Some enterprises opened without any capital from the capitalists. How can they say that there is any capital that needs to be redeemed? I know that the capital for opening the Shanghai Hotel was 600 silver dollars. However, the capitalist Lu Kuqing required each worker to pay a deposit of 50 silver dollars. After recruiting more than 20 workers, the capital was recovered long ago. Giving such capitalists a fixed interest of seven years is a great favor. It is too inappropriate to give them a fixed interest of twenty years.
    The working class has suffered from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie for a long time, and the historical gap cannot be eliminated in a short time. It is precisely because the public representatives have done a lot of work for the staff and workers that the enterprise can be run well.
    She Yushan, a worker at the Wuhan Knitting Factory, said: "Some industrialists and businessmen want the public representatives to withdraw from the joint ventures. I say this is absolutely not possible. There are three main reasons: First, the public representatives represent the economic interests of the state. Without the public representatives, the rights and interests of the state's investment cannot be guaranteed. Our factory has 23 capitalists with a capital of 16,000 yuan, while the state's investment is more than 40,000 yuan. What reason is there to not have public representatives? Second, the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie cannot be changed overnight. Without public representatives, the transformation of the capitalists is unfavorable. Third, the working class has suffered from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie for a long time, and the historical gap cannot be eliminated in a short time. It is precisely because the public representatives have done a lot of work for the staff and workers that the enterprise can be run well. Without public representatives, the internal contradictions of the enterprise will be deepened. They say they don't want public representatives, but in fact, they don't want the leadership of the Party and the working class.
    Facts prove that the bourgeoisie still needs to be transformed.
    "Does the bourgeoisie still have two sides?" Many workers used concrete facts to illustrate this issue. Chen Junchu, a worker at the Xin Kang Chemical Factory, said: "Our factory director used to be a capitalist. Recently, he asked the purchasing staff to buy a centrifuge from a merchant for 1,600 yuan, saying that this thing is not easy to buy and should not be bargained. Later, the purchasing staff bought the same thing from the Yong'an Market for only 400 yuan. This is treating the state's property with a negative attitude." Zhang Baikui, a worker at the Jianghan Machinery Factory, said that Li Xinghe, a private sector employee in our factory, was arranged by the government to be the deputy director of the supply and marketing section after the public-private partnership. Recently, he deserted and left the factory and opened an "underground factory" outside, wanting to take the old capitalist road. This shows that the negative side of the bourgeoisie does not accept socialist transformation. Song Zhenlai of the Wuhan Foundry Factory said in his speech that some private sector employees not only do not encourage those who demand progress, but also attack them. Ye Ziqin, the private sector director of the first workshop in our factory, was dissatisfied with the work style of some private sector employees, and these people attacked him, saying: "You have betrayed the class and your 'position is unstable'." This is a prominent manifestation of two-sidedness. Our private sector factory director said at a meeting outside that the Party and the government have controlled the bourgeoisie too tightly, complaining about the youth supervision posts and insisting on criticizing them. In fact, the private sector section chief received a fixed interest and went to the restaurant for extravagant eating and drinking during working hours. This kind of serious violation of labor discipline is not allowed to be criticized, and it is said that it is too tightly controlled. How can we talk about accepting transformation?"

### 武汉工人同工商界争鸣讲理

    武汉工人同工商界争鸣讲理
    本报讯　据长江日报载：“工商界谈了他们的意见，我们工人也应该跟他们争鸣讲理。”这是出席武汉市公私合营企业老工人座谈会工人一致的呼声。这个会是武汉市工会联合会在28日下午召开的。
      没有党和工人阶级的领导，中国的资产阶级能做出这样大的成绩吗？
    到会的许多工人对最近报上发表的否定一切工作成绩的说法表示非常不满。武汉冶炼厂工人叶礼湖激动地说：“工商界有的人说共产党领导一切，领导没有成绩，应对一切负责。这种说法是不符合事实的。大的事不说，就我们厂来说，是由六个破烂小厂合并起来的。公私合营前，每开一炉要二十四小时，只能出四千斤铁水。合营后有了党的领导，工人积极搞好生产，现在每开一炉只要八小时，铁水出到八千斤，工时减少三分之二，产量提高一倍。这难道不是共产党领导的成绩吗？”江汉印制厂工人肖德符说：“有的人光说工人阶级不行，党的领导也不好，试问这里的长江大桥和武钢是谁建设的？没有党的领导和工人阶级的艰苦劳动，中国资产阶级搞得出这样伟大的工程吗？”
    算算剥削账，有什么理由要求定息延长到二十年？
    “定息应不应该延长到二十年？”这是会上讨论得最热烈的问题。志成布店店员胡行益说，有些工商界人士赞成上海李康年的意见，我要问他们凭什么理由主张定息要延长二十年呢？拿志成布店来说，在1930年开张的时候，股金是一万银元，修理房屋后只剩下四、五千元。1934年资方和别人争夺市场，把一万本钱蚀光了，还外欠倒账十万多元，和债主讲明分期逐年归还。这些钱都是在往后几年剥削我们工人来还的。1946年，资本家东拼西凑了一千元复业，但是，靠着投机倒把和剥削工人，几年内就大发横财，赚到六万多元，资本家不但大吃大喝，还抽出四百五十两黄金的资金投资到永大布店。解放后，经营发生困难，我们先后四次自动减薪来克服困难维持营业，每月工资由五千五百元减到三千五百多元，这样才把企业维持下来，前后两年，工人就少拿工资二万四千元。公私合营后，资方定息一万四千元。这笔钱光是用来偿还我们减掉的工资都不够，还有什么理由说定息二十年呢？这种说法不但我们工人反对，就是我店私方人员刘雨泉也不赞成，他就愿意割掉尾巴，改造成为自食其力的劳动者。看来绝大多数资方都是愿意定息七年，只有少数人赞成定息二十年。武汉铸造工厂宋振来说：二十年后我国已经建成了社会主义，主张定息二十年就是在建成社会主义社会后还要剥削，实际上这种主张也就是要延迟社会主义建设。他举出自己亲身的经历来说明这个问题：我原来在万利翻砂厂做工，开张时资本家张新春只有一座小房子，每年赚的钱都装入了腰包。1952年核定资金八千多元，四马分肥就得了五千四百元，公私合营后又得了一千元。如果他这点资金还要延长定息二十年，那就不是赎买，而是“一本万利贪得无厌”了。旅栈业工人柳云阶说：有些企业开张，资本家根本没有出钱，哪能说有什么资金需要赎买呢？我知道上海饭店开张资本是六百银元。可是，资本家吕奎卿招雇工人每人就要押款五十块银元，招来二十多个工人，本钱早就捞回去了，这样的资本家给他定息七年就是天大的照顾，再要定息二十年就太不应该了。
    工人阶级长期遭受资产阶级的剥削，历史上遗留的隔阂不是一时能消除的。正是由于公方代表向职工群众做了许多工作才能搞好企业。
    武汉针织厂工人佘玉山说：“有的工商界人士要公方代表撤出合营企业。我说这是绝对不行的。这有三大理由：第一、公方代表是代表国家经济利益的，没有公方代表，就不能保障国家投资的权益，我厂有二十三个资本家，资金有一万六千元，国家投资就有四万多元，凭什么理由能不要公方代表呢？第二、资产阶级唯利是图的本质不是一个早上能改变过来的，没有公方代表，对资本家的改造是不利的。第三、工人阶级过去长期遭受资产阶级的剥削，历史上遗留的隔阂不是一时能消除的。正是由于公方代表向职工群众做了许多工作才能搞好企业。没有公方代表就会加深企业内部矛盾。他们说不要公方代表，实际上就是不要党和工人阶级的领导。
    事实证明资产阶级还需要改造。
    “资产阶级现在还有没有两面性？”许多工人用具体事实来说明了这个问题。新康化工厂工人陈俊初说：“我们厂长过去是个资本家，最近他叫采购员用一千六百元到行商那里去买离心器，说这东西不好买不准还价，后来采购员只用四百元就在永安市场买来同样的东西。这就是用消极的态度对待国家的财产。”江汉机器厂工人张白奎说，我厂私方人员李兴和，公私合营后，政府安排他做供销股副股长，最近他开小差离厂，在外面开了一个“地下工厂”，想走资本主义的老路，这就说明资产阶级消极的一面是不接受社会主义改造的。武汉铸造工厂宋振来在发言中说，有些私方人员对要求进步的人，不但不鼓励，反加以打击。我厂第一车间私方主任叶梓琴对有些私方人员的工作作风不满，这些人就打击他说：“你叛变了阶级，‘立场不稳’。这就是两面性突出的表现。我们私方厂长在外面开会说党和政府把资产阶级管得太死，埋怨青年监督岗，硬要批评他们。实际上是私方课长得了定息，在上班时间到馆子大吃大喝，这种严重违犯劳动纪律的事还不让批评，并且说管的太死。这还谈什么接受改造呢？”
