Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 16th: The Chongqing Steel Company revised its production plan for this year in early June, deciding to produce an additional 46,000 tons of steel and over 29,000 tons of steel products for the country throughout the year. The company has already submitted the official increased production plan to the Central Metallurgical Industry Department for approval.

　　At the beginning of this year, the Chongqing Steel Company reduced its production plan due to insufficient raw material supply, resulting in a decrease of 36,000 tons in the output of its main product, steel, compared to last year. However, considering the tight supply of steel products across the country this year, and the company's production capacity not being fully utilized, relevant personnel actively sought ways to increase raw material sources and conserve consumption from all aspects. In the first quarter, the company sent people to various parts of Sichuan to understand the pig iron production situation and helped some local iron plants study some technical issues to improve production, enabling the local iron plants to supply them with over 10,000 tons of pig iron. Although the company's own iron-smelting furnaces did not have much potential for increased production, they also actively took measures to strengthen maintenance work, ensuring that there would be no major overhauls within this year, which could lead to an additional production of over 5,000 tons of pig iron. In addition, coupled with the achievements of increased pig iron production by steel plants across the country and the company's own savings in the first quarter, the difficult problem of raw material supply was successfully resolved.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the company's production level has greatly improved compared to last year. From January to May, the output of both steel and steel products increased compared to the same period last year. Currently, the workers are using open-hearth furnaces to smelt various high-quality steels and trial-produce important products urgently needed for national construction, such as boiler steel plates and bridge steel plates.

　　重庆钢铁公司修订年度计划
　　多产七万五千吨钢和钢材
    新华社重庆16日电　重庆钢铁公司在6月上旬重新修订了今年的生产计划，决定全年多为国家生产四万六千吨钢和二万九千多吨钢材。这个公司已经把正式增产计划报请中央冶金工业部批准。
    今年年初，重庆钢铁公司因为原材料供应不足，曾经削减了生产计划，使主要产品钢的产量比去年降低了三万六千吨。但是公司有关人员鉴于今年各地钢材供应紧张，公司的生产能力没有很好发挥，主动想法从各方面增加原材料来源和节约消耗。第一季度，这个公司曾派人到四川各地了解生铁生产情况，并且帮助部分地方铁厂研究一些生产技术上的问题，以提高生产，使地方铁厂多供应了他们一万多吨生铁。公司自己的炼铁炉虽然增产潜力不大，但是他们也积极采取措施加强维护工作，保证今年内不停产大修，这样可以多生产生铁五千多吨。此外，加上第一季度各地钢铁厂生铁增产和公司本身节约的成绩，使原材料供应的困难问题获得了顺利解决。
    今年以来，这个公司的生产水平已比去年大大提高。1至5月份，钢和钢材的产量都比去年同期有所提高。现在职工们正在利用平炉冶炼多种优质钢和试制国家建设迫切需要的锅炉钢板、桥梁钢板等重要产品。
