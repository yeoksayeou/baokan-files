　　Dong Shiguang Believes that Most of the Masses are Brainless Echoes
    Dong Shiguang, a lecturer at Southwest Normal College, said at a faculty symposium at the college: There are three kinds of masses. According to my analysis, the first kind is the most numerous. They have no brains, cannot think independently, and just follow the leaders' behinds, shouting slogans and acting as uncritical echoes of the leaders. The second kind is a very small minority. They like to flatter and shamelessly scheme. They can say any nauseating flattery to the leaders. The leaders also especially like to listen to these people, often falsely accusing the good as evil, creating countless unjust cases in every movement. The third kind of people have conscience and a sense of justice, but they dare not stand up and speak out. (Excerpt from the Chongqing Daily, May 29)

　　董时光认为大多数群众都是没有头脑的应声虫
    西南师范学院讲师董时光在该院教师座谈会上说：群众有三种，根据我的分析，第一种最多，没有头脑，不能独立思考，只是跟着领导屁股后喊口号，不折不扣地作领导上的应声虫。第二种是极少数，他们喜欢拍马屁，无耻钻营，他们对领导什么肉麻的奉承话都说得出来。领导们也专门喜欢听这种人的话，往往诬良为奸，在每次运动中造成无数冤狱。第三种人是有良心有正义感，却不敢站起来说话。（摘自5月29日重庆日报）
