	"Imperialist Herald Tribune"
	The aircraft from the U.S. aircraft carrier "Hornet" invaded China's airspace and carried out armed provocations, suffering a well-deserved blow from the Chinese people. Even the U.S. State Department could not deny this incident, and had to use "foggy weather" as an excuse to cover up its aggressive behavior.
	However, the "New York Herald Tribune," which is so neurotically afraid of China regaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, seized this opportunity to rant and rave, claiming that "from the point of view of international morality," the actions of China's People's Armed Forces in striking down American military aircraft that violated China's airspace were "completely unreasonable." According to this newspaper, "Whether an aircraft is lost or not, it is immoral and irresponsible to fire on it without good reason." Therefore, according to it, China is not worthy of entering the "international family."
	According to the "New York Herald Tribune's" theory, international law is kicked aside. And the American aircraft invading other countries' airspace, regardless of any motives or reasons, is with "good reason," "reasonable," "moral," and "responsible." It is those who defend their sovereignty and resist aggression who are without "good reason," "unreasonable," "immoral," and "irresponsible."
	If the "New York Herald Tribune" believes that its theory is tenable, why doesn't it suggest that the U.S. government issue a statement: The United States will never interfere with any foreign aircraft that intrude into U.S. airspace? Given that the U.S. government always boasts that it is a government that values "international morality," why doesn't the "New York Herald Tribune" ask its own government to set an example first?
	The "New York Herald Tribune" has not done so, which proves that it is not a herald and forum of international morality, but a herald and forum of aggression-prone American imperialism. It had better change its name to "Imperialist Herald Tribune," instead of using the signboard of "herald" and "forum" to sell dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head. (Jiang)

### “帝国主义先驱论坛报”

    “帝国主义先驱论坛报”
    美国“大黄蜂号”航空母舰上的飞机，侵入中国领空进行武装挑衅，遭到了中国人民的应有的打击。这件事情，连美国国务院也无法抵赖，只好以“有雾天气”为借口，来遮掩自己的侵略行为。
    可是，对于中国恢复它在联合国的合法地位害怕得神经衰弱的“纽约先驱论坛报”，却趁此机会出来大放厥词，说什么“从国际道义的观点来说”，中国的人民武装力量打击侵犯中国的领空的美国军用飞机是“完全没有道理的”。据这家报纸说，“不论一架飞机是否迷失方向，如果没有良好理由而向它开火，那都是不道德的和不负责任的行动。”因此，据它说，中国还不配进入“国际大家庭”。
    照“纽约先驱论坛报”的理论，国际公法是被一脚踢开了的。而美国飞机侵入别国领空，不管有任何动机和原因，都是有“良好的理由”的，有“道理”的，有“道德”的，而且是“负责任”的。没有“良好理由”、“没有道理”、没有“道德”、“不负责任”的倒是那些捍卫自己主权、抵抗侵略的人。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”如果认为它的这套理论站得住脚，它为什么不建议美国政府发表这样一个声明：美国决不干涉侵入美国领空的任何外国飞机？鉴于美国政府总是吹嘘它是一个很讲“国际道义”的政府，“纽约先驱论坛报”为什么不要求自己的政府先做出个榜样来？
      “纽约先驱论坛报”没有这样做，这就证明了它并不是什么国际道义的先驱和论坛，而是侵略成性的美帝国主义的先驱和论坛。它最好把它的名称改作“帝国主义先驱论坛报”，而不必用“先驱”和“论坛”的牌子来挂羊头卖狗肉。（江）
