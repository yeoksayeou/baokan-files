　　Large Areas of Fifth-Instar Locust Nymphs Urgently Need to be Eradicated
　　Serious Summer Locust Plague in the Border Area of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong
    This newspaper reports that the summer locust prevention and control work in the locust areas of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces is underway, with ten airplanes assisting the masses in spraying powder for prevention and control in key locust areas. According to incomplete statistics, the area for locust control in the five provinces is nearly two million mu.
    The summer locust plague is most serious in the border area of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces (including Neihuang, Weixian, Daming, Linqing, Guantao, and other counties). According to the latest situation, the area where locust nymphs have appeared has reached 1.7 million mu, and the density of locust nymphs is very high. In Neihuang County, Henan Province, there are generally about 30 to 100 locust nymphs per square zhang, and in the areas with the highest density of locust nymphs, there are as many as 5,000 to 10,000 per square zhang. Although locust nymphs in this area have been controlled, due to the late start in some areas and the influence of unfavorable weather conditions, there are still large areas of fifth-instar locust nymphs that urgently need to be eliminated.
    According to the person in charge of the Plant Protection Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture: Most of the locust nymphs in the border area of the three provinces have now reached the fifth instar, and some have become adults. If they cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, they will turn into migratory locusts and spread to a larger area. This is a matter that must be taken very seriously. He also said: The neglect of autumn locust control last year is the main reason for the serious summer locust plague in the border area of the three provinces this year. The reproductive capacity of summer locusts is very strong, and the eggs of one female locust can turn into 200 to 300 autumn locusts. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively carry out the prevention and control of summer locusts at present.

　　大面积的五龄蝗蝻亟待扑灭
　　河南、河北、山东交界地区夏蝗严重
    本报讯　河南、河北、山东、江苏、安徽五个省的蝗区防治夏蝗工作在进行中，先后有十架飞机在重点蝗区协助群众喷粉防治。据不完全的统计，五个省防治蝗虫的面积近二百万亩。
    河南、河北、山东三省交界地区（包括内黄、魏县、大名、临清、馆陶等县）夏蝗最严重。据最近情况，这一带发生蝗蝻的面积已有一百七十万亩，蝗蝻的密度很稠。河南内黄县，一般地区每方丈约有蝗蝻三十——一百头，蝗蝻最稠的地方，每方丈多达五千——一万头。这一带的蝗蝻虽经防治，但是由于一些地区动手过晚和不利气候的影响，目前还有大面积的五龄蝗蝻亟待消灭。
    据农业部植物保护局负责人说：三省交界地区的蝗蝻，目前大部到了五龄，部分已成成虫，如果不能在短期内扑灭，它们就会变成飞蝗，蔓延到更大的地区。这是必须十分重视的事情。他还说：去年忽视防治秋蝗，是三省交界地区今年夏蝗严重发生的主要原因。夏蝗的繁殖力很强，一头雌蝗的卵就会变成二、三百只秋蝗。因此目前必须切实作好防治夏蝗工作。
