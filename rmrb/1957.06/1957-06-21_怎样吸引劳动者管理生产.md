How to Attract Workers to Manage Production
V. Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions

The Soviet people are preparing to solemnly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, while also summarizing the path they have travelled. In the past forty years, Russia, once backward in technology and economy, has transformed into a powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union, a country with highly developed industry, large-scale mechanized agriculture, and advanced science and culture.

The reason why the Soviet Union was able to victoriously realize unprecedented changes in scale and depth within a short historical period is because the Communist Party leads the Soviet people and the Soviet working class forward. All activities of the Communist Party are guided by the Marxist-Leninist doctrine that the broadest masses of the people are the true creators of history. The Party believes that attracting workers to directly participate in the management of the Soviet state and all Soviet state organizations and economic activities is the most important condition for the development of the socialist system.

The broad participation of residents in state power organs is primarily realized through the Soviets of Workers' Deputies.

Forms of people's participation in solving important national issues, such as conferences of advanced figures from the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the central and local levels, have gained significant development in our country. National discussions of the most important proposals and bills concerning the development of the country's national economy proposed by the Party Central Committee and the government have become a tradition. Last year, the issue of the national welfare fund bill and the adjustment of the wage system were submitted to the Soviet people for discussion. Not long ago, the issue of national bonds was also discussed by the workers.

From the end of March to the beginning of May this year, the Soviet people conducted in-depth and comprehensive discussions at various meetings and in newspapers on Comrade Khrushchev's report outline "On Further Improving the Organization of Management of Industry and Construction" to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In this outline, the role of trade unions in attracting the masses to participate in production management was once again emphasized.

From the initial years of the establishment of Soviet power, trade unions have actively participated in organizing socialist production and cultivating economic leaders from the working class. Trade unions have encouraged workers to creatively complete national economic plans victoriously, improve labor productivity, and perfect production.

Organizing socialist competition can attract more and more workers to participate in production management, which is a regular task of trade unions. In our country, competition is widely carried out between various departments of the national economy. In each enterprise and each department, trade union organizations and economic workers jointly summarize the competition every month or every quarter, and award advanced collectives with rotating red flags and bonuses.

Trade unions also attract workers to manage production through general meetings and production meetings. Workers can use this platform to express their opinions on production, inquire about the progress of competition, expose shortcomings, and propose suggestions for improving work. According to incomplete materials, more than ten million suggestions from employees were passed at production meetings in our country last year. Implementing these suggestions can produce huge economic effects.

The rationalization proposal movement is an important form for workers to actively participate in the work of perfecting production. In 1956, more than one million rationalization proposers and inventors emerged in enterprises. They put forward more than two million suggestions. Adopting these suggestions can save billions of rubles.

Science and technology associations—voluntary organizations of scientific workers, engineers, technicians, and worker innovators affiliated to trade unions—have also played a significant role. Science and technology associations attract production technology intellectuals to actively participate in improving technical equipment, researching and discussing various technical issues. Science and technology associations have a total of 544,000 members.

Finally, collective contracts are the most powerful tool for trade unions to influence production and living services. Trade union organizations and the administrative departments of enterprises sign collective contracts and study in detail ways to complete and over fulfill national plans. Employees widely discuss the drafted work tasks at workshop meetings or at general meetings of enterprise staff. In such discussions, many suggestions are often put forward.

The entire activity of trade union organizations in enterprises is a real school for learning management, a school for learning to manage the economy. The current situation is that 93% of grassroots trade union organizations do not have full-time staff. In places where there are full-time staff, the main activities are also carried out by the vast number of activists, that is, by the employees themselves in their spare time. The number of activists in Soviet trade unions exceeds 16 million. This means that one in every three trade union members is regularly performing this or that regular trade union task. Factory and workshop committees have subcommittees to handle wage issues, labor protection, living services, and mass cultural work. Employees realize their influence in relevant economic and cultural construction through these organizational forms.

Party and state organs attach great importance to the diverse and multifaceted work of trade unions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union always consider the opinions and suggestions of trade unions when deciding on all major issues related to the labor and daily life of the working class. The national welfare fund bill passed last year and the measures to increase the wages of low-wage workers, shorten working hours, and adjust wages were formulated and implemented with the direct participation of trade unions—the central and local organizations of trade unions. Trade unions participated in the formulation of the bill on gradually transitioning to a seven- to six-hour workday and related measures. The government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, together with the trade unions, promulgated many of the most important documents on the labor and daily life issues of employees.

In order to further activate the work of trade unions, the powers of trade unions are constantly being expanded. For example, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently approved the regulations for reviewing labor disputes. This document greatly increased the effectiveness of the decisions of trade union factory committees or local committees on labor disputes. If the administrative department or agency of the enterprise does not implement this decision, the trade union organization's decision on the labor dispute will be enforced by the court.

The new regulations for the internal rules of enterprises and agencies, which were revised at the initiative of the trade unions, have been implemented. This document more significantly adjusts the relationship between the administrative side and the workers, enabling trade union organizations to supervise the creation of working conditions for production labor.

In the activities of trade unions, in general, there are still some shortcomings, especially in attracting the masses to participate in production management. Many of these shortcomings are due to the lack of initiative of trade union leading organs and over-concentration of work. At the same time, the departmental management of industry and construction also had an adverse impact on the work of trade unions. The leaders of the various specialized ministries and competent authorities are far away from the enterprises, which obviously hinders local trade union organizations from more broadly attracting the masses of workers to participate in economic management. The establishment of local organs for managing industry and construction will enable trade union organizations to better complete their tasks in this regard, directly participate in the preparation of production and financial plans for enterprises and construction projects as well as economic joint organizations, and more quickly resolve issues related to carrying out competition, improving the labor and living conditions of employees, and implementing collective contracts.

Due to the reorganization of the management structure of industry and construction, trade unions are taking measures to strengthen their organizations. It is now preparing to merge many trade unions with similar production, simplify trade union agencies, and strengthen the committees of states, border regions, and republics, that is, strengthen the agencies that directly lead grassroots organizations and maintain contact with the national economic commissions. Under the new conditions, the powers of local organs—trade union councils—of states, border regions, and republics will be expanded. These agencies will be able to effectively lead local department trade union organizations, participate in the work of national economic commissions, and represent all employees in the economic administrative region. The issue of trade union tasks after the management structure of enterprises and construction is changed is now being discussed at the plenary session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

Soviet trade unions strive to fundamentally improve their activities so that they will not fall short of the lofty title of "school for learning management, school for learning to manage the economy, school for learning communism" conferred by Lenin.

I am very happy to take this opportunity to publish an article through the "People's Daily" to extend brotherly greetings to the workers of the People's Republic of China in the name of the Soviet trade unions, and wish them new achievements in socialist construction.

　　怎样吸引劳动者管理生产
　　全苏工会中央理事会主席　维·格里申
    苏联人民正在筹备隆重地庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年，同时并对过去所经历的道路进行总结。四十年来，曾经在技术经济方面落后的俄罗斯已变成为一个威力强大的社会主义强国——苏联，它是一个有着高度发展的工业、大规模机械化的农业、先进的科学和文化的国家。
    苏联之所以能在短暂的历史时期内胜利地实现了在规模和深度上都是前所未见的变化，是因为有共产党领导着苏联人民、苏联工人阶级向前迈进。共产党的全部活动，都是以马克思列宁主义认为最广大的人民群众是历史的真正创造者这一学说为指南的。党认为吸引劳动者直接参加管理苏维埃国家、管理苏维埃国家一切组织和经济的活动，是社会主义制度发展的最重要的条件。
    居民广泛地参加国家政权机关首先是通过劳动者代表苏维埃来实现的。
    人民群众参加解决重要的国家问题的形式，如苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在中央和地方所召开的工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子的先进人物的会议，在我国获得了重大的发展。全民讨论由党中央委员会和政府提出的有关发展国家的国民经济的最重要的建议和法案，已经成了传统。去年，关于国家优抚金法案和调整工资制度的问题，都曾交给苏联人民进行了讨论。不久以前，关于国家公债问题也由劳动者进行了讨论。
    今年3月底至5月初，苏联人民在各种会议和报刊上深入和全面地讨论了赫鲁晓夫同志向苏联最高苏维埃会议作的“关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作”的报告提纲。在这个提纲中，又一次更加强调了工会在吸引群众管理生产工作中的作用。
    工会从苏维埃政权成立的最初几年起就积极地参加了组织社会主义的生产，从工人阶级中培养经济领导干部。工会鼓舞了劳动者创造性地去胜利完成国民经济计划，提高劳动生产率，使生产趋于完善。
    组织社会主义竞赛可以吸引越来越多的劳动者参加管理生产，这是工会的经常工作。在我国，国民经济各个部门之间广泛地展开竞赛。在每个企业和每个部门中，工会组织和经济工作人员一道，每个月或每个季度都要对竞赛作一次总结，授给先进的集体以流动红旗和奖金。
    工会也通过全体大会和生产会议来吸引劳动者管理生产。劳动者利用这种讲坛，就可以说出对生产的意见，过问竞赛的进程，揭露缺点，提出改进工作的建议。根据不完全的材料，去年在我国生产会议上曾通过了职工的一千万件建议。实现这些建议能够产生巨大的经济效果。
    合理化建议运动是劳动者积极参加使生产趋于完善的工作中的重要形式。1956年，企业中涌现的合理化建议者和创造发明者达一百万人以上。他们提出了二百多万项建议。采纳他们的这些建议能节省亿万卢布。
    科学技术协会——工会所属的联合科学工作人员、工程师、技术员和工人革新者的自愿的组织——也起了不小的作用。科学技术协会吸引生产技术知识分子积极参加改善技术设备，研究和讨论各种技术问题。科学技术协会共有会员五十四万四千人。
    最后，集体合同是工会用以影响生产和生活服务的最有力的工具。工会组织和企业的行政部门签订集体合同，详细地研究关于完成和超额完成国家计划的办法。职工在车间会议上或在企业工作人员的全体大会上广泛讨论所拟定的工作任务。在这样的讨论中，常会提出很多的建议。
    企业中工会组织的全部活动是真正的学习管理的学校，学习主持经济的学校。现在的情形是，在93％的基层工会组织里没有专职的工作人员。而在那些有着专职的工作人员的地方，主要的活动也是由广大的积极分子来进行的，也就是由职工本人在业余时间来进行的。苏联工会中积极分子的人数在一千六百万人以上。这就是说，每三个工会会员中有一人经常在执行这项或那项工会的经常任务。工厂和车间委员会下设处理工资问题、劳动保护、生活服务、群众文化工作的小组委员会。职工通过这些组织形式在有关的经济和文化建设方面实现自己的影响。
    党和国家机关十分重视工会的多种多样和多方面的工作。苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议在决定工人阶级一切有关劳动和日常生活的重大问题时，总要考虑到工会的意见和建议。去年所通过的关于国家优抚金法案和提高低工资职工的工资、关于缩短工作日、调整工资等措施，是在工会——工会的中央机关和地方组织——的直接参加下制定和实现的。工会参加制定了关于逐步过渡到七至六小时工作日的法案和与此有关的措施。政府和苏共中央委员会同工会一道颁布了关于职工劳动和日常生活问题的许多最重要的文件。
    为了进一步活跃工会的工作，工会的权力得到不断的扩大。例如，不久以前苏联最高苏维埃批准了审查劳动争议的规章。这项文件使工会的工厂委员会或地方委员会关于劳动争议的决定产生了很大的效力。如果企业的行政部门或机关不执行这个决定，那么工会组织的关于劳动争议的决定将由法院强制执行。
    根据工会的倡议而改订的企业和机关内部章程的新规章已付诸实施。这项文件更显著地调整了行政方面和工人之间的关系，使工会组织实现了对为生产劳动创造工作条件的监督。
    在工会的活动中，一般说来首先在吸引群众参加管理生产的方面还存在着一些缺点。其中有许多缺点是工会领导机关缺乏积极性，工作过分集中等一些原因。同时，工业和建设的分部门管理的情况也对工会工作起了不良的影响。各专业部和主管机关的领导远离企业千里，这显然会阻碍了地方工会组织更广泛地吸引劳动群众参加经济的管理工作。成立管理工业和建设的地方机关，就会使工会组织更好地完成自己在这方面的任务，直接参加编制关于企业和建筑工程以及经济联合组织的生产财务计划的工作，更加迅速地解决与开展竞赛、改善职工的劳动和生活的条件、执行集体合同等有关的问题。
    由于工业和建设管理结构的改组，工会正在采取加强自己组织的措施。现在准备把许多生产相近的工会合并，使工会机构精简一些，并加强州、边疆区和共和国的委员会即加强那些直接领导基层组织并同国民经济委员会保持联系的机构。在新的条件下，州、边疆区和共和国的地方机关——工会理事会的权力将会有所扩大。这些机关将有可能有效地领导地方部门的工会组织，参加国民经济委员会的工作，代表该经济行政区的全体职工。关于企业和建设的管理结构改变后的工会任务问题，现在正在全苏工会中央理事会的全体会议上进行讨论。
    苏联工会力求根本改进自己的活动，以便使它丝毫不辜负列宁所授予的“学习管理的学校，学习主持经济的学校，学习共产主义的学校”的崇高称号。
    我很高兴借此通过“人民日报”发表文章的机会，以苏联工会的名义向中华人民共和国的劳动者致以兄弟的敬礼，并预祝他们在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。
