Xinhua News Agency, June 27th. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the Japanese Former Servicemen Delegation headed by Saburo Endo.

　　Zhang Xiruo said at the meeting that the Chinese people all hope to develop peaceful and friendly relations with the Japanese people, and he believes that the Japanese people also have the same desire. He said that the different social and political systems of the two countries cannot hinder peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges between the two countries.

　　Saburo Endo, as the organizer of this delegation, introduced the members of the delegation to the host at the meeting.

　　He said that in order to strengthen friendly and amicable relations between Japan and China, it is very important to be tolerant and generous towards some past events. And China has very well expressed tolerance and generosity to us. He then expressed his gratitude to China for its measures in dealing with Japanese war criminals, sending back ashes, and repatriating overseas Chinese.

　　Saburo Endo, who has visited China three times in the past three years, also said that when he came to China the year before last, he was surprised to see the great construction carried out by the Chinese people, but at that time there was still an unnecessary idea that this might be like a fair, lively for a while. When I came last year, I saw that China's construction had advanced by leaps and bounds, and the people's emotions were vigorous. Now, seeing the situation of China's construction is already well-organized, and the people are showing more calmness and confidence. He expressed his respect for this.

　　Saburo Endo also said that they were the first group of Japanese to cross the Yangtze River Bridge. He said that this great project—the Yangtze River Railway Bridge connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River—symbolizes the great unity of the Chinese people. He hopes that this unity will develop as a symbol of Asian unity, and he also hopes that the people present will also become a bridge connecting the two major camps of the East and the West. He said that the delegation is willing to do its part in this regard.

　　Liao Chengzhi also spoke at the meeting. He said that China and Japan must further develop friendly relations in the future and treat each other with sincerity. He said: "The past is forever past, please drink a toast to our bright future and to the growing friendly relations between our two countries."

　　Later, he proposed a toast to the common desire of the Chinese and Japanese people—to defend peace in East Asia, to defend national independence, and to strengthen the friendly unity between the two countries.

　　Former Japanese Lieutenant General Iwao Matsutani said when toasting that the delegation is willing to contribute to Sino-Japanese friendship.

　　Li Dequan, Lei Renmin, people from all walks of life who have visited Japan, and heads of relevant departments and people's organizations attended the banquet tonight.

　　张奚若宴请日本前军人访华团
    宾主热望发展中日人民的和平友好关系
    新华社27日讯  中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今天晚上设宴欢迎以远藤三郎为首的日本前军人访华团。
    张奚若在会上说，中国人民都希望发展同日本人民的和平友好关系，相信日本人民也会有同样愿望。他说，两国的社会制度和政治制度的不同，并不能妨碍两国的和平相处和友好往来。
    远藤三郎作为这个访华团的筹备人，在会上向主人介绍了访华团人员。
    他说，为了加强日中两国友好亲善关系，对过去一些事情能够予以宽容和宽大是很重要的。而中国已很好地向我们表示了宽容和宽大。接着，他对中国在关于处理日本战犯、遣送骨灰和遣返侨民等方面所作的措施表示感谢。
    在最近三年中，曾三次前来中国访问的远藤三郎还说，他前年来中国时，看到中国人民所进行的伟大建设，感到很惊奇，但是当时还有一种不必要的想法，认为这会不会像赶集一样，热闹一时。去年来时，看到中国的建设已是突飞猛进，人民的情绪是生气蓬勃的。而现在看到中国的建设情形则已经井然有序，人民也表现得更加沉着，更加自信了。对此，他表示敬意。
    远藤三郎还说，他们是走过长江大桥的第一批日本人。他说，这个伟大的工程——长江铁桥连接着长江南北，正象征着中国人民的大团结。他希望这个团结发展起来，作为亚洲团结的象征，他并且希望在座的人们还成为连接东西两大阵营的桥梁。他说，访华团愿在这方面尽自己的一份力量。
    廖承志也在会上讲了话。他说，中日两国今后必须进一步发展友好关系，并且以诚相见。他说：“过去已永远过去，请为我们光辉的未来，为我们两国的友好关系日益发展而干一杯。”
    后来，他又提议，为中日两国人民共同的愿望——保卫东亚和平，保卫民族独立和加强两国的友好团结而干杯。
    日本前中将松谷磐在敬酒时说，访华团愿为中日友好而贡献出力量。
    李德全、雷任民和访问过日本的各界人士，以及各有关部门和人民团体的负责人，出席了今晚宴会。
