Chairman Marko's Speech
Most respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhou Enlai:
Dear Comrades and Friends:

The delegation of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania has come to your beautiful country for a friendly visit. The delegation feels obliged to once again sincerely thank the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China for inviting us and giving us a very warm and fraternal reception. We feel extremely pleased and honored to be able to meet with the representatives of the great Chinese people and to learn about the life and creative labor of the talented Chinese people who are victoriously building socialism.

There is a sincere brotherly friendship between the people of Albania and China, a friendship as unbreakable as the will of our two peoples, because it is built on completely new and unprecedented foundations, on the basis of mutual respect, complete equality, and ideological consistency with Marxism-Leninism. Although our two countries are geographically separated by thousands of miles, we believe that no force can slightly weaken the love between our two peoples and create obstacles on our common socialist road.

Albania and China are members of the great socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has spared no effort in the past and present to help us build a happy future. Therefore, we and the entire socialist camp call the Soviet Union our elder brother and our loyal ally. The Soviet Union's concern for us is like a mother's love for her children. The relations between our socialist countries are based on the famous Leninist principles of mutual respect and complete equality, and therefore the socialist camp is unbreakable.

The Albanian people also have a loyal and sincere friend like the Chinese people, who have wholeheartedly helped us build a new life in the past and present.

Dear Comrades and Friends:

The visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China to Albania in January this year and the visit of the delegation of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania to China illustrate how close our two peoples are and how quickly they communicate because they share a common language—Marxism-Leninism. These two mutual visits demonstrate the deep and sincere love that exists between our two peoples. These visits have helped and will continue to help further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples.

We sincerely thank the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China for making it possible for us to visit many provinces and cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Anshan. We also sincerely thank the People's Committee of Beijing Municipality for making it possible for us to learn about the work and historical sites of the capital. Wherever we went, from the leading cadres of various provinces to the ordinary working people, we talked with them and received their warm and fraternal welcome. We were pleased to see the Chinese people's internationalist spirit and love for the Albanian people and our country. Everywhere we felt like we were at home.

During our stay in the People's Republic of China, we visited the huge Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Wuhan Bridge construction site spanning the Yangtze River, agricultural cooperatives, schools, the Shenyang Industrial Exhibition Hall, the Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, and other places. Everywhere we witnessed with our own eyes that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, all the working people are united as one, creating tremendous achievements day by day, and the material and cultural living standards of the masses are constantly improving. We were immensely gratified when we heard the workers from the Yangtze River Bridge, the electrician Zhang Mingren (transliteration) from Shenyang, and the cooperative members from Jiangsu speak optimistically and confidently about the improvement of their lives.

We sincerely congratulate the great Chinese people on their continuous great achievements in overcoming the difficulties left over from the old era and encountered on the road to building a new life.

During our visit to the People's Republic of China, we were pleased to see everywhere that the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government on rectification and the correct handling of contradictions among the people were supported and endorsed by the entire people.

During our stay in this great country, we saw the driving force and confidence of your people, as well as the tremendous achievements you have made in social, economic, and political fields. We express our heartfelt admiration for this. The great achievements of your people in industry, agriculture, culture, and education are a clear example of the working masses' selfless construction of socialism. All of this inspires our socialist construction in our country.

Our visit to the People's Republic of China has helped us like a large school. We will tell the Albanian people about your achievements and your love for us and our country. We will always benefit from the work of your simple and talented working people.

Comrades, I assure you that the Albanian people are the loyal and sincere comrades and allies of the Chinese people.

I take this opportunity to ask everyone to raise their glasses to the friendship between Albania and China!

Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech
Dear Ambassador, dear Comrade Marko and all comrades of the delegation, comrades, friends:

Today, at the banquet held by the Ambassador, we are very happy to once again gather with the Albanian delegation.

In the course of three weeks, the comrades of the delegation visited nine important cities in our country, visited our industrial, agricultural, cultural, and educational undertakings, learned about the lives of our workers and peasants, and had cordial conversations with leaders at all levels and people from all walks of life. The Chinese people felt very cordial and honored to receive the visit of their brothers from afar.

Although we have achieved certain successes in our socialist construction in recent years, our economy and culture are still backward. When we are building our own country, we always remember the help and support given to us by the socialist camp countries, including Albania, headed by the Soviet Union. The envoy of the Albanian people, led by Comrade Marko, participated in physical labor with the Chinese people in Guangzhou, which is a very good encouragement to us.

The friendship and unity between our two peoples are closely linked with the friendship and unity between all socialist countries. As everyone knows, the imperialists are afraid of the unity between socialist countries and are doing everything possible to undermine this unity. The more they fear this unity, the more we must unite; the more they try to undermine this unity, the more closely we must unite. We believe that among socialist countries, no matter the size of the country and the past relationship between individual countries, as long as they always hold the common desire to strengthen proletarian international solidarity and follow the principles of proletarian internationalism, the friendship and solidarity of socialist countries will be forever consolidated and strengthened, and the evil attempts of imperialism will forever become dreams.

Finally, I propose

To the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, to the further strengthening of the friendship and unity of all socialist countries, to the health of Comrade Marko and all comrades of the delegation, to the health of Comrade Hoxha, the wise leader of the Albanian people!

    中阿友谊　永远巩固
    马尔科主席的讲话最尊敬的刘少奇同志，周恩来同志：亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会代表团来到你们美丽的国家作了友好的访问，代表团认为有责任再一次地衷心感谢中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会，是它邀请了我们和给予我们非常热烈的兄弟般的接待。我们认为有可能来和伟大的中国人民的代表会晤，来了解正在胜利地建设社会主义的天才的中国人民的生活和创造性的劳动，感到极大的愉快和光荣。
    阿中两国人民之间存在着真诚的兄弟友谊，这种友谊就像我们两国人民的意志一样是牢不可破的，因为它建筑在完全新的、史无前例的基础上，在互相尊重、完全平等的基础上，在马克思—列宁主义思想一致的基础上。虽然在地理上我们两国隔着千山万水，但我们认为没有任何力量能稍微削弱我们两国人民之间的热爱和在我们共同的社会主义道路上制造障碍。
      阿中两国是以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营中的成员。苏联过去和现在都不惜一切地帮助我们建设一个幸福的未来。因此，我们和整个社会主义阵营称苏联为我们的老大哥和我们的忠实的同盟者，苏联对我们的关心就好像母亲对孩子一样。我们社会主义各国的关系建立在互相尊重和完全平等的著名的列宁主义原则的基础上，因而社会主义阵营是牢不可破的。
      阿尔巴尼亚人民同样有像中国人民这样一个忠实和真诚的朋友，中国人民在过去和现在都全心全意地帮助我们建设新生活。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团今年1月在阿尔巴尼亚的访问和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会代表团在中国的访问说明了我们两国人民之间是多么的亲近，互通往来是多么迅速，因为他们有着共同的语言——马克思列宁主义。这两个相互访问表明了我们两国人民之间存在着深切和真诚的热爱。这些访问过去和将来都有助于我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊的进一步加强。
    我们由衷地感谢中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会，是它给予我们以方便访问了很多省份和武汉、广州、杭州、上海、南京、天津、沈阳、鞍山等城市。我们同样衷心地感谢北京市人民委员会，是它给予我们可能来了解首都的工作和古迹。我们所到之处，从各省的主要干部到普通的劳动人民，我们都和他们谈了话，受到了他们热烈的、兄弟般的欢迎，我们高兴地看到中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民和我们的国家的国际主义精神和热爱。我们 到处感到像在自己的家里一样。
    我们在中华人民共和国逗留时间内，参观了巨大的鞍山钢铁公司、横架在长江上的武汉大桥工地、农业合作社、学校、沈阳的工业陈列馆、广州的出口商品展览会和其他地方。到处我们都亲眼看到全体劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下，团结得像一个整体一样，他们正在日新月异地创造着巨大的成就，群众的物质和文化水平正在不断地提高。当我们从长江大桥的工人那里、从沈阳电气工人张明仁（译音）和江苏的合作社员们那里听到他们乐观地、信心百倍地讲述着生活改善的情况的时候，感到无比的欣慰。
    我们衷心地祝贺伟大的中国人民在克服旧时代所遗留下来的和在建设新生活的道路上所遇到的困难方面，不断地获得巨大成就。
    我们在中华人民共和国访问的期间，到处满意地看到中国共产党中央委员会和中国政府关于整风和正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，受到了全体人民群众的支持和拥护。
    我们在这个伟大的国家逗留的期间，看到了你们人民的前进动力和信心，以及你们在社会、经济、政治各方面所取得的巨大成就，我们为此而表示衷心的钦佩。你们的人民在工农业、文教各方面取得的巨大成就是劳动群众忘我的建设社会主义的明显例证。所有这些鼓舞着我们在我国进行的社会主义建设。
    我们在中华人民共和国的访问像一座大的学校一样帮助了我们。我们将把你们的成就、你们对我们和我国的热爱告诉阿尔巴尼亚人民。我们在任何时候都将从你们朴实的、天才卓越的劳动人民的工作中得到收获。
    同志们，我向你们保证：阿尔巴尼亚人民是中国人民的忠实而真诚的同志和盟友。
    趁这个机会，请大家为阿中友谊而干杯。刘少奇委员长的讲话亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的马尔科同志和代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，在大使举行的宴会上，我们同阿尔巴尼亚代表团再一次欢叙一堂，感到十分愉快。
    在三个星期的时间里，代表团的同志们访问了我国的九个重要城市，参观了我国的工业、农业和文化教育事业，了解了我国的工人和农民的生活，并且同各级领导人员和各阶层人民群众进行了亲切的交谈。中国人民对于远道而来的兄弟的访问，都感到十分亲热和荣幸。
    几年来，我们在社会主义建设事业中虽然取得了一定的成就，但是我们的经济和文化还是落后的。我们在建设自己国家的时候，时刻记着以苏联为首的、包括阿尔巴尼亚在内的社会主义阵营各国对于我们的帮助和支援。以马尔科同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者在广州同中国人民一道参加了体力劳动，这对于我们就是一个很好的鼓舞。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊和团结是同一切社会主义国家之间的友谊和团结紧密地联结在一起。大家知道，帝国主义者是害怕社会主义各国之间的团结的，并且千方百计地破坏这种团结。他们越是害怕这种团结，我们就越要团结；他们越是企图破坏这种团结，我们就越要更加紧密地团结起来。我们相信，在社会主义各国之间，不论国家大小和个别国家之间过去的相互关系如何，只要彼此永远抱着加强无产阶级国际团结的共同愿望并且遵循无产阶级国际主义的原则，社会主义各国的友谊团结就会永远巩固和加强，帝国主义的罪恶企图就会永远成为梦想。
    最后我提议
    为中阿两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊，为社会主义各国的友谊团结进一步加强，为马尔科同志和代表团全体同志们的健康，为阿尔巴尼亚人民的英明领袖霍查同志的健康　干杯！
