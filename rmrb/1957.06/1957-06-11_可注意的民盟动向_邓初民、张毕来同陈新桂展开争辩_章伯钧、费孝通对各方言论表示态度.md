Noteworthy Trends in the China Democratic League
　　Deng Chumin, Zhang Bilai, and Chen Xingui Engage in Debate
    Zhang Bojun and Fei Xiaotong Express Attitudes Towards Various Opinions
    (Our Newspaper) The Central Group of the China Democratic League held its third meeting last night. At the meeting, a debate unfolded on the question of whether the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. Chen Xingui, an alternate member of the Central Committee who has expressed such erroneous views more than once, continued to defend his views at this meeting. He said that he completely agreed with Chu Anping's statement that the Communist Party's "Party World" mentality is the root of all sectarianism. Moreover, he speculated that Chu Anping may have been afraid of being labeled a revisionist and did not further point out the source of this "Party World" mentality. He believed that the root of the "Party World" mentality is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Then, Chen Xingui further elaborated his view, saying: The Stalinist errors that occurred in the Soviet proletarian dictatorship and the Hungarian Incident that occurred in the Hungarian proletarian dictatorship prove that there are problems with the proletarian dictatorship as a political system. Chen Xingui also said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually the dictatorship of the Communist Party. In this way, when the Communist Party implements policies and exercises leadership over the country, it first trusts Communist Party members, then Communist Youth League members, and then those who lean towards the Party. Under such circumstances, it is unimaginable that sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism would not arise, and it is difficult to imagine that a "Party World" would not form.
    Central Standing Committee member Deng Chumin immediately criticized Chen Xingui's erroneous views. Deng Chumin first pointed out: I completely agree that the dictatorship of the proletariat has its shortcomings, but I cannot agree that bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism are produced by the dictatorship of the proletariat. Deng Chumin emphasized: The dictatorship of the proletariat itself will never produce bureaucracy, subjectivism, or sectarianism. On the contrary, the reason why bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism arise is precisely because some Communist Party members have lost their proletarian stance. Deng Chumin said: If Communist Party members firmly stand on the proletarian position, they will not produce sectarianism that excludes others, they will not produce bureaucratism that is divorced from the masses, and they will not produce subjectivism that is divorced from reality. The rectification campaign is precisely a Marxist-Leninist ideological education movement and a proletarian stance education movement. The purpose of the rectification campaign is to enable all Communist Party members to firmly stand on the proletarian position and strengthen the class nature and Party spirit of Communist Party members. Deng Chumin believes that the stronger the class nature and Party spirit of Communist Party members, the less likely they are to have sectarian ideas and the less likely they are to have the "Party World" mentality. Then Deng Chumin also criticized Chu Anping's erroneous argument about the "Party World," believing that Chu Anping's talk of a "Party World" does not conform to the facts. He said that the "Party World" theory makes it seem as if the world belongs to the Communist Party and that others have no share, which is untenable both in theory and in practice. He said: We democrats have participated in legislative, administrative, and judicial powers, and it is not a one-party dictatorship by the Communist Party.
    Central Committee member Zhang Bilai also expressed disagreement with Chen Xingui's views in his speech. He said: "The dictatorship of the proletariat has enabled workers and peasants in our country to achieve a great turnaround, enabled intellectuals throughout the country to obtain genuine freedom, and enabled the bourgeoisie to achieve peaceful transformation. This is the greatest good thing, and this is the most extensive democracy. How can it be said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism?" He also said: Although the dictatorship of the proletariat also has shortcomings, the dictatorship of the proletariat itself has the power to continuously overcome bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism, and the current rectification campaign is clear evidence of this. How can it be said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root cause of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism?
    Zhang Bojun, who spoke first at the meeting, also said: Chen Xingui's view that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the cause of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism is a theoretical and principled error.

    Zhang Bojun said: My opinion may be a major mistake, or it may not be that serious.
    Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun said in his speech that he thanked all parties for their criticism in the newspapers of his speech at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee.
    He said that a person's speech cannot guarantee that everything is correct, and when one says something incorrect, one always thinks it is correct. After everyone's criticism and reminders, one can examine oneself and see what is wrong, which is helpful to me and is a good thing.
    Zhang Bojun then talked about whether counter-criticism is encirclement and suppression. He said that he did not agree with the statement that counter-criticism is "encirclement and suppression." He said that criticism should have a democratic style and the magnanimity to listen to different opinions. The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee held thirteen meetings, with seventy-three people speaking, and everyone raised many opinions, all of which were criticisms. The Communist Party did not feel that this was "encirclement and suppression." Now, other parties have put forward different opinions, and this cannot be said to be "encirclement and suppression." Otherwise, it would be that you are only allowed to criticize, and others are not allowed to criticize. The People's Daily editorial proposed "There should be both active criticism and correct counter-criticism," which is reasonable and justified.
    Zhang Bojun talked about everyone's criticism of him. He said that he did not want to debate the opinions raised about him because that would be too petty. My opinion may be a major mistake of confronting the Party's leadership and damaging the Party's leadership, or it may not be that serious. I talked about the issue of a political design institute. Design is the business of engineering and technical personnel, not those in a leadership position. I also talked about the meeting procedures of the State Council, etc. Perhaps, given my position in political life, it is not appropriate to raise these issues, or perhaps my words were vague. I will never defend myself and will not say things that are insincere.
    Finally, Zhang Bojun expressed disagreement with Zhang Yunchuan's proposal to disclose the secret identities of Communist Party members in the China Democratic League. Regarding Chu Anping's opinions, he agreed with all parties' criticism of Chu Anping.

    Fei Xiaotong talks about the two contradictions in his heart and his opinions on resolving the contradictions.
    Central Standing Committee member Fei Xiaotong made a speech entitled "Those who speak are not guilty, and mistakes must be corrected." First, he said that he recently had two contradictions in his heart. One is the contradiction between eliminating concerns and distinguishing right from wrong; the other is the contradiction between ensuring freedom of speech and preventing some erroneous remarks from having a bad influence on society. Then he put forward several opinions on resolving the above two contradictions:
    First, he believes that we should continue to eliminate concerns and speak freely. Here, we must fully trust the Party's guarantee, that is, "those who speak are not guilty." However, in order to resolve contradictions and improve understanding, we must be fully prepared to accept criticism ideologically, and everyone must be determined to "correct mistakes."
    Second, he believes that publicizing opinions must be done with a sense of responsibility. If we consider in advance whether the social impact will prevent us from speaking freely, I want to resolve this contradiction by ensuring open debate. Both the positive and negative sides of a point of view must have ample opportunities to be published in society. At the same time, we must also admit that what we think is correct may not necessarily be correct. If others point out mistakes, it is helping us, not attacking us. If we recognize our mistakes, we should also have the courage to correct them publicly.
    Third, he believes that this Party rectification campaign is not only an ideological transformation within the Party but also an ideological transformation of all our people. Ideological transformation must be gentle and gradual. In a tense atmosphere, ideas are not easily truly transformed. He agrees with adopting a small-scale democratic approach, preferably a heart-to-heart talk between four or five people. Therefore, he feels that there have been too many symposiums recently, and reporters have participated in all of them. The content of the symposiums is published in the newspaper overnight, and the atmosphere seems a bit tense.
    Fourth, he believes that there must be a common basis for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," which is to take the socialist road and accept the Party's leadership.
    Central Committee member Wang Shiming also spoke at the meeting.

    Chen Xingui agrees with Fei Xiaotong's speech and accuses newspapers of running a "hat shop" for counter-criticism of erroneous remarks.
    In his speech, Chen Xingui twice criticized the People's Daily. In his first speech, he began by saying: I spoke for twenty minutes at the symposium last time, but the People's Daily did not publish my speech at all. Instead, it devoted a full page to publishing counter-criticism against me. This is unfair. (Editor's note: The China Democratic League did not notify this newspaper to participate in this symposium.) He demanded that the People's Daily publish his entire speech this time. He also said that the rectification campaign is now underway, opposing sectarianism, and the People's Daily should not commit sectarianism in this matter.
    Before the end of the meeting, Chen Xingui once again criticized the People's Daily. He expressed full agreement with Fei Xiaotong's speech. He said that the current tension is a fact, and this will not eliminate everyone's concerns. He described the counter-criticism of anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist remarks in the newspapers these days as "hats flying everywhere." He said that the newspapers should not be the boss of Sheng Xifu Hat Shop. He also said passionately: "To be honest, if they were counter-revolutionaries, they would never say what the newspapers consider to be erroneous remarks; they would certainly say how great the Communist Party's achievements are, etc."

　　可注意的民盟动向
　　邓初民、张毕来同陈新桂展开争辩
    章伯钧、费孝通对各方言论表示态度
    本报讯  中国民主同盟中央小组昨天晚上举行了第三次会议，会上对无产阶级专政是不是产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源的问题，展开了争论。曾经不止一次地发表这种错误言论的候补中央委员陈新桂，在这次会上继续为自己的观点辩护，他说他完全同意储安平所说的共产党的“党天下”思想是一切宗派主义的根源。而且据他臆测储安平可能是怕被人戴上修正主义的帽子，而不曾进一步指出这个党天下的思想根源是什么，而他认为党天下的思想根源就是无产阶级专政。接着，陈新桂进一步阐述他的观点说：从苏联无产阶级专政中发生的斯大林错误，从匈牙利无产阶级专政中发生的匈牙利事件，证明无产阶级专政这个政治制度是有问题的。陈新桂又说，无产阶级专政实际上就是共产党的专政。这样，共产党在贯彻政策的时候，在实行对国家领导的时候，首先要信任共产党员，再就是信任青年团员，再就是信任靠拢党的人。在这样一种情况下，如果不产生宗派主义，不产生主观主义和官僚主义，是不可想像的，不形成“党天下”是很难想像的。
    中央常务委员邓初民紧接着就批判了陈新桂的错误观点。邓初民首先指出：说无产阶级专政有它的缺点我完全同意，但说官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义是由无产阶级专政产生的我不能同意。邓初民强调说：无产阶级专政本身决不会产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，相反，所以会产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，正是由于有些共产党员丧失了无产阶级立场的结果。邓初民说：如果共产党员要是站稳无产阶级立场就不会产生不要别人的宗派主义，就不会产生脱离群众的官僚主义，就不会产生脱离实际的主观主义。整风，正是马克思列宁主义的思想教育运动，也是无产阶级立场的教育运动。整风的目的就是要使所有的共产党员站稳无产阶级的立场，增强共产党员的阶级性和党性。邓初民认为，共产党员的阶级性愈强，党性愈强，就愈不会有宗派主义思想，就决不会有“党天下”的思想。接着邓初民还批判了储安平所说的“党天下”的错误论调，他认为：储安平说的党天下是不合乎事实的。他说，党天下之说，好像天下是共产党的，别人没有份，无论从理论上、事实上都说不通。他说：我们这些民主人士都参与了立法权、行政权、司法权，并不是共产党一党专政。
    中央委员张毕来发言中也对陈新桂的观点表示不能同意。他说：“无产阶级专政使得我国的工人和农民得到了大翻身，使全国的知识分子得到了真正的自由，使得资产阶级得到了和平的改造，这是最大的好事，这是最广泛的民主。怎么能说无产阶级专政是产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源呢？他又说：无产阶级专政虽然也有缺点，但是，无产阶级专政本身就具有不断克服官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的力量，目前的整风就是明证。怎么能说无产阶级专政是产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源呢？
    在会上第一个发言的章伯钧也说：陈新桂认为无产阶级专政是产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的观点，是理论上原则上的错误。
    章伯钧说：我的意见可能是大错误，也可能没有那么严重
    副主席章伯钧在他的发言中说：他感谢各方面在报纸上对他在中共中央统战部发言的批评。
    他说，一个人的讲话不能保证都对，不对的自己说出来的时候总以为是对的。经过大家的批评、提醒，自己可以检查一下，有那些不对，这对我是有帮助的，是好的。
    章伯钧接着谈到了反批评是不是围剿问题。他说他不同意反批评是“围剿”的这种说法。他说批评要有民主的风度，要有倾听不同意见的雅量。中共中央统战部开了十三次会，有七十三人发言，大家提了很多意见，都是批评，共产党没有觉得这是“围剿”。现在，其他方面提出了不同的意见，这不能说是“围剿”。否则，就是只许你批评，不许别人批评。人民日报的社论提出“要有积极的批评，也要有正确的反批评”，这是合乎情合乎理的。
    章伯钧谈到大家对他的批评，他说，关于对我提的意见，我不想辩论，因为那就太小气了。我的意见可能是对抗党的领导、损伤党的领导权的大错误，也可能没那么严重。我说到政治上的设计院问题，设计是工程技术人员的事，不是居于领导地位的，也谈到国务院的开会程序问题等，也许就我在政治生活中所处的地位，不适宜于提这些问题，也许我的话说得含糊。我决不辩护，不说言不由衷的话。
    最后，章伯钧对于张云川所提出的公开民盟中的共产党员秘密身份问题，表示不同意。对于储安平的意见，他同意各方面对储安平的批评。
    费孝通谈他内心里的两个矛盾和解决矛盾的意见
    中央常务委员费孝通以“言者无罪，有错必改”为题作了发言。首先，他说他最近内心里有两个矛盾。一个是既要解除顾虑，又要明辨是非的矛盾；一个是既要保证言论自由，又要防止有些错误的言论在社会上发生坏的影响的矛盾。接着他提出解决以上两个矛盾的几点意见：
    第一，他认为应当继续解除顾虑，畅所欲言，这里我们必须完全信任党的保证，就是“言者无罪”。但是为了解决矛盾，提高认识，必须在思想上有充分的接受批评的准备，人人要有决心“有错必改”。
    第二，他认为公开发表言论，必须有负责精神，如果预先考虑到社会影响是不是会不能畅所欲言呢？我想要解决这个矛盾就是要保证公开辩论。一个论点的正反两面都得有充分机会在社会上发表。同时还要承认自己认为正确的东西可能不一定正确的，如果别人指出了错误是帮助自己而不是打击自己，自己认识了错误，也应当有勇气公开地纠正。
    第三，他认为这次党的整风，不但是党内的思想改造，也是我们全体人民的思想改造。思想改造必须是和风细雨的，在紧张空气中，思想是不容易真的改造的。他赞成采取小小民主的方式，最好是四、五个人促膝谈心。因此，他觉得最近座谈会开得太多，而且都有记者参加，座谈内容过一晚就上了报，空气似乎有些紧张。
    第四，他认为鸣和放必须有个共同的基础，这就是走社会主义道路，和接受党的领导。
    在会上发言的还有中央委员汪世铭。
    陈新桂同意费孝通的发言，并指责报纸对错误言论的反批评是开帽庄
    陈新桂在他的发言中，曾经两次指责了人民日报。他在第一次发言时，一开头就说：我上次在座谈会上讲了二十分钟的话，人民日报根本没有登我的发言，以后却满版登载对我的反批评，这不公平。（编者按：陈新桂所说的这次座谈会，民盟并没有通知本报参加。）他要求人民日报把他这次发言全部发表。他还说，现在正在整风，反对宗派主义，人民日报在这件事情上不要犯宗派主义。
    会议结束之前，陈新桂又一次指责了人民日报。他表示完全同意费孝通的发言。他说目前一些紧张是事实，这样大家的顾虑就不能消除。他把这几天报纸上对于反共产党、反社会主义的言论的反批评，说成是帽子满天飞。他说，报纸不要作盛锡福帽庄的老板。他还激昂地说：“老实讲，要是反革命分子，绝不会讲报纸上认为的错误言论；他一定会讲，共产党的成绩多么伟大之类。”
