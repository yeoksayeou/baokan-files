    This newspaper reports: At the symposium on the work of urban cultural centers held by the Ministry of Culture, representatives from various provinces and cities criticized the cultural authorities and the propaganda and education departments of Party committees at all levels for not paying enough attention to mass amateur cultural work. They believe that the main root cause of this shortcoming is that the leaders of the cultural departments are divorced from reality and the masses.
    The representatives criticized the Ministry of Culture for having the views of "emphasizing the major and slighting the minor," "emphasizing the public and slighting the private," "emphasizing the professional and slighting the amateur," and "emphasizing enterprises and slighting undertakings," neglecting the cultural needs of the broad masses and neglecting mass amateur cultural work. The representatives pointed out that many provincial and municipal cultural bureaus rarely manage mass amateur cultural work, let alone the work of cultural centers. The work of cultural centers is not included in the work schedule of leaders. In the past eight years, the Ministry of Culture has only issued one instruction on the work of cultural centers, rarely inspected the work, and has not convened a special meeting on this work. Some provincial and municipal cultural bureau chiefs, or Party committee ministers of culture and education, and propaganda ministers believe that cultural centers are just places for the masses to play around. The more they play, the better; the less they play, the better. Therefore, they do not care about this work. The representatives pointed out that the leaders of cultural work do not recognize the important role of cultural center work in enlivening mass cultural work and meeting the cultural needs of the masses. Therefore, they do not care enough about the urgent cultural needs of the people. In Shanghai, one cultural center in one district has an average of 10,000 participants per day. This exceeds the activity volume of any theater or cinema. On Sundays, many people queue outside the center waiting for activities. Even these facts have failed to persuade the leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture to give it sufficient attention.
    The representatives mentioned that cultural centers have many difficulties in terms of activities and equipment conditions. Many cultural centers still lack necessary activity places, some are located in dilapidated houses and temples, and some cultural center staff do not even have housing; some places even occupy cultural center sites at will. Many cultural centers lack necessary equipment and funding.
    There are also unreasonable phenomena in the use, training, political and living treatment of cultural center cadres. The phenomenon of randomly pulling cultural center staff is relatively common and very serious. Henan and Hebei provinces have conducted a general training for more than 1,000 cultural center staff, but only a few hundred people remain in the cultural center positions, and the rest have been transferred to other jobs. Some people describe cultural centers as cadre reception centers and sanatoriums. Some places arrange patients with mental illness, the sick, old, disabled, and weak, and even the elderly family members of cadres to cultural centers, thinking that it is "just a matter of guarding the hall and issuing signs." Some of the cultural center staff are graduates of universities and colleges, and some have professional knowledge, but they are not regarded as senior intellectuals. Some people were originally excellent teachers in schools, but their treatment is worse than that of an ordinary teacher after being transferred to the cultural center. Cultural center staff rarely participate in various meetings of the Party system and the government system. These have caused ideological depression among cultural center staff, making many people feel uneasy about their work. These have not been resolved due to insufficient attention from the leadership.
    The speeches of the representatives show that insufficient attention to the work of cultural centers is a relatively common phenomenon. From top to bottom, from institutions to society, this work is not valued. Some representatives pointed out that the leadership of the Ministry of Culture has not fully implemented the Party's policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The leaders of the cultural departments have not conducted investigations among the masses and do not understand the living conditions and needs of the broad masses of people. This is a rather serious style of bureaucracy.
    These criticisms of the representatives have aroused the attention of the Ministry of Culture and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, have successively invited the representatives to a symposium to listen to criticisms. They also answered some questions for the representatives and gave some instructions for future work.
    Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, made a summary speech at the last meeting. In the speech, he affirmed the achievements of urban cultural center work and reviewed the shortcomings of the Ministry of Culture's leadership in insufficient attention to the work of cultural centers. He clarified the fundamental policy of mass amateur cultural work, taking the mass line, relying on the strength of the masses themselves, relying on social forces to do things, and the state providing guidance, encouragement, and support. The working conditions of cultural centers are indeed difficult at present, and should be gradually improved in the future. He encouraged everyone to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and frugality in running centers, and to closely contact and cooperate with various mass organizations to further improve mass amateur cultural work.
    This symposium lasted for eighteen days, from May 27 to June 13, with a total of 63 representatives from various provinces and cities participating in the meeting. At the meeting, the representatives also exchanged experiences, discussed and put forward suggestions for future work, which the Ministry of Culture is prepared to study and improve.

### 各地城市文化馆干部  批评文化部对群众业余文化工作重视不够

　　各地城市文化馆干部
　　批评文化部对群众业余文化工作重视不够
    本报讯　在文化部召开的城市文化馆工作座谈会上，各省市代表批评文化主管部门和各级党委的宣传文教部门对群众业余文化工作不够重视。他们认为产生这种缺点的主要根源，是文化部门的领导者脱离实际和脱离群众。
    代表们批评文化部有“重大轻小”、“重公轻私”、“重专业轻业余”、“重企业轻事业”的观点，忽视广大群众对文化生活的要求，忽视群众业余文化工作。代表们指出不少省市的文化局，很少管群众业余文化工作，更不管文化馆的工作。文化馆工作排不进领导者的工作日程里去。八年以来，文化部只发过一次关于文化馆工作的指示，很少检查工作，也没有召集过一次有关这一工作的专门会议。有些省、市的文化局长或是党委文教部长、宣传部长们认为：文化馆不过是群众玩玩闹闹的地方，能多玩就多玩，能少玩就少玩，因此就不去过问这一工作。代表们指出：文化工作的领导者不认识文化馆工作在活跃群众文化工作，满足群众文化生活上的重要作用，因此，对人民群众迫切的文化生活要求，就不够关心。上海市一个区的一个文化馆，平均每天有一万人次参加活动。这超过任何的剧院和影院的活动量。星期天还有不少人在馆外排队等候活动。这样的事实，也并未能说服上海市文化局的领导者，引起他们足够的重视。
    代表们提到文化馆在活动上、设备条件上存在着很多困难。许多文化馆还缺乏必要的活动场所，有的是设在破房烂庙里，有的文化馆工作人员甚至连住所都没有；有的地方甚至随便占用文化馆址。许多文化馆缺乏必要的设备和经费。
    关于文化馆干部的使用、培养、政治和生活待遇上也存在着不合理的现象。乱拉文化馆工作人员的现象比较普遍，也很严重。河南、河北两省，对一千多个文化馆工作人员，普遍进行过一次训练，但至今留在文化馆工作岗位上的不过是数百人，其余都被调作其他工作了。有人把文化馆形容成为干部招待所、疗养院。有些地方把神经病患者，病老残弱者，甚至干部的年老家属都安插到文化馆去，认为“不过是守守馆发发牌子”的工作。文化馆工作人员中有一些是高等院校毕业的，有些是具有专业知识的，也不被看作高级知识分子。有些人原是学校中的优秀教师，被调来文化馆后待遇反不及一个一般教师。文化馆的工作人员很少能参加党的系统和政府系统的各种会议。这些都使文化馆工作人员思想上产生苦闷，使许多人不安心工作。这些也由于领导上重视不够没有得到解决。
    代表们的发言表明：对文化馆工作重视不够是一种比较普遍的现象。从上到下，从机关到社会，都不重视这工作。有的代表指出，文化部领导上对党的文艺为工农兵服务的方针贯彻得是不够全面的。文化部门的领导者没有到群众中去进行过调查，不懂得广大人民的生活状况和要求。这是一种相当严重的官僚主义作风。
    代表们的这些批评，引起了文化部和中共中央宣传部的重视。文化部钱俊瑞副部长、中共中央宣传部副部长周扬曾先后专门邀集代表们座谈，听取批评。并向代表们解答了一些问题，对今后工作有所指示。
    文化部副部长张致祥在最后一次会上作了总结性发言。发言中肯定了城市文化馆工作的成绩，并检查了文化部领导上对文化馆工作重视不足的缺点。明确了群众业余文化工作的根本方针，走群众路线，依靠群众自己的力量，依靠社会力量办事，国家进行指导、鼓励和扶植。目前文化馆工作条件确有困难，应在今后逐步加以改善。他勉励大家继续发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭办馆的光荣传统，并与各个群众团体密切联系，相互协作，进一步做好群众业余文化工作。
    这个座谈会，从5月27日起到6月13日止，共开了十八天，参加会议的各省市代表共63人。会上代表们还交流了经验，讨论和提出了对今后工作的建议，文化部准备进行研究，加以改进。
