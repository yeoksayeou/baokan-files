Xinhua News Agency, London, May 31st. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons on the 30th that Britain has decided to relax its trade controls on China.

He said that the basis for trade with China will now be the same as the basis for Britain's trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. "Certain goods currently prohibited from being shipped to China will either be transferred to the quantity control list, or transferred to the surveillance list, or the embargo will be completely lifted."

He also said: "The necessary details must be discussed in the China Committee (the Western body overseeing the embargo against China). As soon as possible, the rules for export controls on goods will be revised accordingly." He said that licenses will be issued upon request for all goods currently prohibited from being shipped to China but which do not require export permits for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Regarding materials subject to quantity control when exported to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, licenses cannot be issued until quotas for exports to China have been discussed in Paris.

An MP asked whether, in the Paris-based international committee on trade controls with China, countries other than the United States would adopt the same policy as the United Kingdom.

Lloyd said: "They have not yet stated their position. I think they are waiting to hear what the British government will say, but I expect most member states will follow our example."

It is reported that the British government made the decision to relax trade restrictions on China under strong political pressure from various quarters at home. Since the Korean armistice, more than three hundred motions on this issue have been presented to successive governments in Parliament, of which about seventy were submitted after the Anglo-American summit in Bermuda in late March this year.

    英国决定单独放宽对华贸易限制
    劳埃德说预料大多数参加“禁运”国家会效法英国
    新华社伦敦31日电　英国外交大臣劳埃德30日在下院宣布，英国已经决定放宽它的对中国贸易管制。
    他说，对中国贸易的基础目前将跟英国同苏联和东欧国家的贸易的基础一样。“目前被禁止运往中国的某些货物，或者是转到数量管制货单上，或者是转到监视货单上，或者是完全取消禁运。”
    他还说：“必要的细节安排必须在中国委员会（西方主持对中国禁运事宜的机构）中讨论。一俟可能，就将相应地修正货物出口管制规则”。他说，对于现在被禁止运往中国、而对苏联和东欧国家不需出口许可手续的一切货物，将根据要求发给许可证。关于向苏联和东欧国家出口时受到数量管制的物资，在巴黎讨论对中国出口的定额数目之前不可能发给许可证。
    有议员问，在巴黎对中国贸易管制国际委员会中，除了美国以外，其他国家是否会采取跟联合王国一样的政策。
    劳埃德说：“它们还没有表明它们的态度。我认为它们是在等着听听英国政府将说些什么，但是我预料大多数成员国都会效法我们。”
    据报道，英国政府是在国内各方面强烈的政治压力之下作出放宽对中国贸易限制的决定的。自从朝鲜停战以来，在议会中有三百多项关于这个问题的动议摆在历届政府的面前，其中约有七十项是在今年3月下旬英美首脑百慕大会谈以后提出的。
