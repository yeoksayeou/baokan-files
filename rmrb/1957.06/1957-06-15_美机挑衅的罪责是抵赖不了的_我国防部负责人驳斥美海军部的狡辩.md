Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Regarding the U.S. Navy's attempt to deny the incident of U.S. military aircraft intruding into our country's airspace on June 12th, a person in charge of the relevant department of the Ministry of National Defense today met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter.

The person in charge said that on June 12th, four naval attack aircraft taking off from the U.S. aircraft carrier "Hornet" intruded into the airspace over the Shantou area of Guangdong Province for harassment activities and were subjected to fierce fire from our anti-aircraft artillery units, one of which was damaged. However, the U.S. Navy openly attempted to deny this, at one point claiming that these aircraft were conducting routine flight training over the Taiwan Strait and that when one of them was hit, it was over the high seas about eight miles from the coast. At another point they said that the aircraft was flying in foggy weather and the jet pilot could not accurately measure the distance from the coastline itself, and it flew somewhat west of its intended course, etc., attempting to portray the intrusion into our country's airspace as an unintentional event.

The person in charge of the relevant department of the Ministry of National Defense pointed out that the U.S. Navy's statement is not in accordance with the facts. First of all, the fact that these U.S. aircraft and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft invaded at the same time eloquently proves that this provocative act by the U.S. was not accidental, but a completely planned action. These U.S. aircraft intruded from the airspace over Jinghai in Guangdong Province, and flew all the way to the airspace over Shantou, penetrating 40 to 50 kilometers into the mainland of our country. Are these places high seas? Are these airspaces that U.S. pilots can arbitrarily choose for training flights?

The person in charge of the relevant department of the Ministry of National Defense said that according to meteorological records, the weather in the Shantou area on the 12th was clear and the visibility was good, with no fog at all. Flying in such weather conditions, and at a low altitude of 1,000 meters, could it be that the so-called jet pilot could not accurately measure the distance from the coastline? The gentlemen of the U.S. Navy are fabricating this with too little common sense. Facts speak louder than sophistry. The guilt of U.S. military aircraft openly violating our country's airspace and antagonizing the Chinese people cannot be denied.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Washington News: U.S. State Department press officer White admitted on June 13th that a U.S. Navy aircraft was hit by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery because it had intruded into Chinese airspace. He defended the action of invading Chinese airspace, saying that "the plane was flying in foggy weather and flew somewhat west of its intended course."

White said that "the United States does not intend to take any action."

The day before, a U.S. Navy spokesman said that U.S. warships were continuing to conduct exercises in the South China Sea.

### 美机挑衅的罪责是抵赖不了的  我国防部负责人驳斥美海军部的狡辩

　　美机挑衅的罪责是抵赖不了的
　　我国防部负责人驳斥美海军部的狡辩
    新华社14日讯　国防部有关方面负责人，今天就美国海军部妄图抵赖12日美军飞机侵入我国领空的事件，接见了新华社记者。
    负责人说，6月12日，自美国航空母舰“大黄蜂”号上起飞的海军攻击机四架，侵入我广东省汕头地区上空进行骚扰活动，遭到我高射炮部队猛烈炮火的射击，击伤其中一架。但是，美国海军部竟公然企图抵赖，忽而说这批飞机是在台湾海峡上空进行例行飞行训练的，其中一架被击中时，在离海岸约八英里的公海上空，忽而又说，这架飞机是在多雾的天气下飞行的，喷气机驾驶员不能确切测量离海岸线本身的距离，它多少飞到它预定航程西面一些等等，企图把侵入我国领空的行为，说成是无意的事件。
    国防部有关方面负责人指出，美国海军部的这种说法是不符事实的。首先，这批美国飞机和蒋机同时入侵的事实，就雄辩地证明了美国这次挑衅行为并非偶然，而是完全有计划的行动。这批美国飞机从我国广东省靖海上空侵入，一直飞到汕头上空，深入我国大陆达四、五十公里。难道这些地方是公海吗？是美国飞行员可以任意选作训练飞行的空域吗？
    国防部有关方面负责人说，据气象记载，12日这天，汕头地区天睛，能见度良好，根本没有下雾。在这样的天气条件下飞行，又是在一千公尺的低空飞行，能产生所谓喷气机飞行员无法确切测量离海岸线的距离吗？这点美国海军部的先生们未免捏造得太缺乏常识了。事实胜于狡辩，美国军用飞机公然侵犯我国领空，敌视中国人民的罪责是抵赖不了的。
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特6月13日承认，美国海军飞机因为侵入了中国领空而被中国高射炮击伤。他为侵犯中国领空的行动辩解，说“这架飞机是在多雾的天气下飞行的，它多少飞到它预定的航程西面一些”。
    怀特表示“美国不打算采取任何行动”。
    在这前一天，美国海军发言人说，美国军舰还在南中国海继续进行演习。
