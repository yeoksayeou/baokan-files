According to the Hubei Daily, the construction of the main plant of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex is extending in all directions.

On the vast construction site of the main plant, countless hills and mounds have been leveled. The massive outlines of some factories and temporary worker residences have been built in large numbers. On June 3rd, the pouring of the foundation concrete for the No. 1 coke oven of the coking plant, an important project of the main plant, began. The steel pipe scaffolding of the coke oven chimney has been connected to more than twenty meters. The concrete for the chimney body will also be poured soon. Some auxiliary construction projects of this plant, such as the coke screening building, the repair office building, the coke storage building, the fire truck garage, and the lubricating oil depot, have had their foundations laid, and the bricklaying of some has been completed. At the construction site of the refractory materials plant, the raw material warehouse of the clay-bonded silicon brick workshop has had twenty-eight column bases laid, and the cushioning concrete has also been laid in the lime kiln workshop. The foundation pit of the fire clay workshop has begun to be excavated. The carpentry workshop, machine repair workshop, and material warehouse of this plant have all had their walls completed and are in the process of hoisting beams. The land leveling work for the ironmaking plant, which will begin construction in July, has been basically completed. Some temporary mobile plank roads leading to the blast furnace site have been paved, the main lines of water pipes have been connected to the site, and the power high-voltage lines have been erected. The forty-ton tower crane, which will be used to hoist the furnace body in the future, has begun to be installed at the construction site.

At the factory front area construction site, some auxiliary facilities projects serving the future construction and production of the large factory: the installation work of the metal structure workshop, forging workshop, and machine repair workshop are being accelerated, preparing to be handed over in stages in July. The electrical repair workshop and the steel casting workshop are also under intense construction. The installation of the first set of generators in the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant has been basically completed. The first phase of the factory front avenue, the main highway connecting Wuhan Iron and Steel to the outside world, will be completed by the end of this year. The engineering tasks of the production auxiliary enterprise company of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation have also been greatly strengthened. The two mixers of the concrete mixing plant are now mixing in three shifts around the clock; the four mixers expanded in February this year are being installed. The expanded assembly workshop of the timber processing plant was put into production in May, and the civil engineering part of the newly built anti-corrosion workshop has been basically completed. The expanded pre-stressed concrete pipe factory has started construction. In order to supply raw materials in a timely manner, the train railway at Wuchang Station has been connected to the mixing plant, prefabrication plant, and quarry. Originally, the stones for the mixing plant had to be supplied by Wuhan City, but now they can be directly transported from the quarry.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 10th. The iron and steel complex that the state's first five-year plan determined to build in Baotou will see the start of construction of the first batch of production auxiliary factory buildings in the second half of this year. Six production auxiliary workshops, including cast iron, cast steel, metal structure, forging, mechanical and electrical repair, and wood mold, are under construction in the factory area. After these workshops are completed, they will undertake the repair of mechanical equipment for the metallurgical, steel rolling, and other production systems of the complex. The source water project for the production water supply of the factory area will excavate part of the earthwork this year. The site leveling project for coking and refractory materials factories, as well as part of the dedicated railway project in the factory area, will also be carried out in August and September this year.

In the Bayan Obo iron ore area, a water pipeline of more than twenty kilometers long is about to be completed recently. In the second half of this year, in addition to carrying out the site leveling project, construction will also begin on industrial sites for projects such as chemical testing laboratories, mechanical repair shops, garages, material warehouses, and boiler rooms. A dedicated railway of more than twenty kilometers in the mining area will also be constructed. While carrying out construction, this iron ore area has already begun small-scale mining, and it is expected to produce more than 200,000 tons of ore this year.

The second thermal power plant in Baotou, which started construction in May last year, is currently under intense construction. The main building of the thermal power plant will be completed by the end of this year.

The Baotou Metallurgical Construction Corporation, which undertakes the construction of the iron and steel complex, has basically completed the preparations before large-scale construction this year. The mechanized supply station, concrete prefabrication plant, and steel bar processing plant, which the company started construction last year, are being put into production one after another.

　　武钢、包钢建设得怎样了？
    据湖北日报讯  武汉钢铁联合企业主厂房的建设工程，正在向四方伸延。
    在辽阔的主厂房工地上，无数的山包、丘陵已被削平。一些工厂的巨大外形和工人临时住宅已经大批的建立起来。6月3日，一个主厂房的重要工程——炼焦化工厂的第一号焦炉开始浇灌了底板混凝土。焦炉烟囱的钢管脚手架已接上二十多公尺。不久也要浇灌烟囱筒身的混凝土。这个厂一些辅助建设工程，如筛焦楼机修办公楼、储焦楼消防车库、滑润油库等，有的基础已经打好，砌砖工程有的已经完成。在耐火材料厂的工地上，粘土粘硅砖车间的原料仓库已打了二十八个柱基，石灰焙烧车间也打了垫层混凝土，火泥车间的基础坑开始挖了土。这个厂的木工车间、机修车间、材料仓库都砌完了墙、正在吊梁。将在7月份开工的炼铁厂，平土工程基本完成，通向高炉工地的一些临时活动板路面已铺好，水管的干管已联接到现场，电源高压线已架好。准备将来吊装炉体的四十吨塔式吊车，已在工地开始安装。
    在厂前区工地上，一些为将来大厂建设和生产服务的辅助设施工程：金属结构车间、锻造车间、机修车间的安装工作正在加速进行，准备在7月份分期交工。电修车间和铸钢车间也在紧张建设。武汉热电厂第一组发电机的安装基本完成，武钢对外联系的主要公路——厂前大道第一期工程将在今年年底完成。武汉冶金建筑总公司的生产附属企业公司，工程任务也已大大加强。混凝土搅拌厂的两架搅拌机现在日夜三班轮流搅拌；今年2月份扩建的四台搅拌机在安装机器。木材加工厂扩建的装配车间已在5月份投入生产，新建的防腐车间土建部分基本完成。扩建的混凝土预加应力制管厂已开工。为了及时供应原料，武昌车站的火车铁路已联接到搅拌厂、预制品厂、采石场，原来搅拌厂的石子要由武汉市供应，现在可直接由采石场运来了。
    据新华社包头10日电  国家第一个五年计划确定在包头建设的钢铁联合企业，今年下半年有第一批生产附属厂房开始施工。在厂区内施工的有铸铁、铸钢、金属结构、锻造、机械电机修理、木模等六个生产附属车间。这些车间建成以后，将担任联合企业冶炼、轧钢等生产系统机械设备的修理工作。供应厂区生产用水的水源地工程，今年将挖掘一部分土方。焦化和耐火材料等工厂的厂址平整工程、厂区部分专用铁路工程，也都将在今年8、9月份进行施工。
    在白云鄂博铁矿区，一条二十多公里长的输水管线最近即将完工。今年下半年除了进行场地平整工程以外，还有化学化验室、机械修理厂、汽车库、材料仓库、锅炉房等工程在工业场地上开始建筑。二十多公里的矿区专用铁路也将施工。这个铁矿区在进行建设的同时，已经开始进行小规模开采，今年预计生产矿石二十多万吨。
    从去年5月开始动工建设的包头第二热电站，目前正在紧张地施工。热电站的主厂房将在今年年底完工。
    承担建设钢铁联合企业的包头冶金建筑总公司，今年已经基本上完成了大规模施工前的准备工作。这个公司去年开始建设的机械化供应站、混凝土预制品厂和钢筋加工厂等正陆续投入生产。
