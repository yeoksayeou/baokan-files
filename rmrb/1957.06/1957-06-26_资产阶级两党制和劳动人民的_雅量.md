　　Before the anti-rightist struggle unfolded, almost as soon as the topic of expanding the country's democratic life or supervising public affairs was mentioned, some people immediately thought of having an opposition party in politics, abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and so on, and they showed great interest, appearing eager to give it a try. This shows that even though the broadest masses of people have chosen the path of socialism, some people still support capitalism in their hearts.

　　These people already had a standard for measuring democratic politics in their minds, and that standard was American bourgeois democracy. If it meets the American standard, it is considered democracy; if not, it is not. They use this standard to measure socialist democracy and are always disapproving. When they heard about expanding democratic life and mutual supervision, they revealed a strong desire to replace socialist democracy with bourgeois democracy everywhere.

　　Those who are infatuated with bourgeois democracy believe that it is better than socialist democracy because of the existence of opposition parties. They say that we don't have such "generosity" here.

　　Yes, we don't have such democracy in our country, and the masses of people who support socialism should not have such "generosity." If we look at the essence of bourgeois democracy, that "generosity" is actually very limited. The ruling class in capitalist countries—the bourgeoisie—always has two or more political parties at the same time, which oppose each other on certain specific issues and take turns in power. You come to power, and I am in the opposition, attacking you. I come to power, and you become the opposition, attacking me. This situation is precisely a reflection of the economic anarchy and group competition of the bourgeoisie in politics. In capitalist countries, capitalists are bound to be divided into different groups, vying with each other, squeezing each other out, and fighting for power and profit. Therefore, different groups of political parties are bound to emerge, and even within the same political party, there are many factions. However, the programs of all these political parties and factions have no fundamental differences. They all safeguard the interests of the bourgeoisie. No matter who comes to power, they always use all means to protect bourgeois ownership and the bourgeois ruling order over the working people. Therefore, no matter how many tricks these parties have, they all belong to the bourgeoisie. This two-party or multi-party system adopted by the bourgeoisie is also a way to obscure the essence of bourgeois dictatorship in front of the ruled masses. When the ruling party becomes unpopular, it is replaced by another party. On the surface, it seems to be in line with public opinion and very democratic, but in reality, it is still the same bourgeois dictatorship. The reason why the opposition party vigorously attacks the ruling party is to make the people believe that there is a real fundamental difference between the opposition party and the ruling party, so that when the people are disappointed with the ruling party, they place their hopes on themselves. When the opposition party becomes the ruling party, the policies it implements are still the same as those of the original ruling party, and the many beautiful words it said when it was in the opposition are treated as if they had never been said. Some capitalist countries also recognize the freedom of proletarian parties to engage in legal activities, because the bourgeoisie cannot exist independently of the proletariat, and the struggle of the proletariat also forces the bourgeoisie to recognize the legal status of proletarian parties. However, even if the proletarian party has a legal status, the bourgeoisie can still use various methods to restrict it, so that it cannot produce members of parliament to participate in the parliament at all, or only individual candidates are elected as members of parliament, and they cannot play a role in the parliament. Even if the proletarian party can actually win more seats in the parliament, it will inevitably have to continue to be an opposition party because of the joint resistance of all bourgeois parties. Once the existence of the proletarian party directly threatens the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie, then the bourgeoisie will use violent means to deny the legal existence of the proletarian party. Therefore, the so-called two-party or multi-party system in capitalist countries is only a form of bourgeois dictatorship.

　　The dictatorship of the proletariat is the opposite of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the majority of the working people over the minority of the exploiters, not the dictatorship of the minority over the majority. Such a fundamental difference has caused a comprehensive change in the democratic system. Under the socialist system, although there are still some inconsistencies and contradictions between workers, peasants, and other working people, they all can strive for the victory of socialism under the leadership of the working class, because socialism is their common interest. Therefore, a fundamental political consistency has formed among them. This consistency prevents the working people from being divided into different political groups and parties like the bourgeoisie, and the working-class party—the Communist Party—becomes the party that represents the public interests of all working people. The working people establish the dictatorship of the proletariat under the leadership of the Communist Party, not for anyone's private interests, but to finally eliminate all class differences and achieve a communist society. This is the great ideal shared by all progressive mankind, and only the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the working people under the leadership of the proletariat grasping state power, can make it realize. The dictatorship of the proletariat, which is engaged in such a bright and just cause, does not need to conceal its essence in various ways like the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and of course, it does not need to imitate the deceptive form of the so-called two-party or multi-party system of the bourgeoisie.

　　Our country's people's democratic dictatorship is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, there are still various democratic parties in our country. Most of these democratic parties participated in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal united front led by the Communist Party because they were excluded and oppressed during the Kuomintang rule. After the Kuomintang rule was overthrown, the democratic parties continued to become political organizations that negotiated with the Communist Party to resolve various issues in the new period of the Chinese revolution, because they recognized that the realization of socialism was in line with the laws of social development in China and were willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and accept the socialist program. The Communist Party announced the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision towards the democratic parties, requiring them to play an active role in transforming the members of the national bourgeoisie and upper petty bourgeoisie they represent. The democratic parties in our country are different from the opposition parties in capitalist countries, because the relationship between them and the Communist Party is one of leadership and being led. The manifestation of this relationship is not one on the stage and one off the stage, but both are on the stage, that is, the democratic parties participate in the management of state affairs under the leadership of the Communist Party. The facts of the past eight years have proved that the policy of the Communist Party is correct, and the democratic parties have played their role in the political life of the country.

　　Those who are infatuated with bourgeois democracy attempt to interpret long-term coexistence and mutual supervision as a bourgeois two-party system. This is completely wrong. According to their idea, the so-called two-party system in China, of course, refers to the Communist Party, which represents the working class and the working people, and the democratic parties, which represent the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, taking turns in power. Just imagine that in European and American capitalist countries, there is only a two-party system of the bourgeoisie, and there is no two-party system of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie has never taken turns in power with the proletariat according to the two-party system. They have always had two parties within them taking turns in implementing the same or similar policies to maintain capitalism. Could it be that we can implement a two-party system of the working class and the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie in our country? Obviously impossible. The political parties of the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie only support socialism and regard it as their program because they are led by the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, they would only have a bourgeois democratic program or a social reformist program, and it would be impossible to generate a socialist program from within. Many people in the democratic parties sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party. They strive to bring themselves closer to the Communist Party and the working people, and do not demand the implementation of a two-party system. However, those who advocate a two-party system, although they verbally say that they want to take the road of socialism, actually want to return to the road of capitalism in their hearts. When they say they want a two-party system, they actually want to separate the democratic parties from the leadership of the Communist Party and abandon the socialist program adopted under the leadership of the Communist Party. If a two-party system can be realized, capitalism will be restored. Of course, the working people cannot have such "generosity," and all those who support socialism cannot have such "generosity."

　　It can be seen that the two-party system is not feasible. The democratic parties can only have a real future by linking themselves with the working people, resolutely obeying the leadership of the Communist Party, and striving to contribute to the cause of socialism. But it is very possible that some people will say that in this case, there will only be long-term coexistence, but no mutual supervision. People with this idea seem to think that mutual supervision can only be achieved if the democratic parties and the Communist Party are in a position of opposition. This is not right. The reason why the democratic parties are still an active rather than a passive factor in our country's socialist cause is precisely because they are not in a position of opposition to the Communist Party, and there is no antagonistic contradiction between them and the Communist Party. The so-called mutual supervision is possible precisely under this condition. Those who participate in supervision must regard building socialism as their common goal with all the working people. Those who deviate from socialism should be supervised, those who hinder socialism should be supervised, and those who have bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism should be supervised, so that the role of supervision can be correctly played. If differences occur that deviate from the common goal, they cannot be called supervision, but opposition to socialism and class struggle, which will inevitably transform non-antagonistic contradictions into antagonistic contradictions.

　　Gentlemen who support bourgeois democracy, please put away your programs. It is completely reasonable for the people to not tolerate a two-party or multi-party system.

　　资产阶级两党制和劳动人民的“雅量”
　　黎澍
    在反右派斗争展开以前，差不多一提到扩大国家民主生活，一提到公共事务的监督，便有人马上联想到在政治上要有反对党，要取消无产阶级专政等等，并且表现出极大的兴趣，很有一点跃跃欲试的样子。足见在我们这里，虽然最广大的人民群众已经选择了社会主义的道路，但是有些人心里还是拥护资本主义的。
    在这些人心目中早有一个衡量民主政治的标准，这标准就是美国的资产阶级民主。合乎美国标准的，便算是民主，不合则不民主。他们拿这个标准衡量了社会主义民主，总是不以为然。听说要扩大民主生活，要互相监督，便处处流露出一股热热的想要用资产阶级民主代替社会主义民主的感情来。
    这些醉心于资产阶级民主的人们认为资产阶级民主比社会主义民主好些，理由之一就是有反对党的存在。他们说，在我们这里就没有这样的“雅量”。
    是的，在我们国家没有这样的民主，拥护社会主义的人民群众也不应当有这样的“雅量”。如果看一看资产阶级民主的实质，那“雅量”实在也有限得很。资本主义国家的统治阶级——资产阶级总是同时有两个或更多的政党，它们在某些具体问题上互相反对，轮番执政。你上台，我就在台下做反对党，攻击你。我上台，你又做反对党，攻击我。这种状况，正是资产阶级经济上的无政府状态和集团竞争在政治上的反映。在资本主义国家中，资本家必然分成各个集团，互相倾轧，互相排挤，争权夺利，因此也必然产生不同集团的政党，并且在同一政党内部分成许多派系。但是所有这些政党和派系的纲领并没有根本的分歧，它们都是维护资产阶级的利益的，无论谁上台，总是用一切方法来保护资产阶级的所有制和资产阶级对劳动人民的统治秩序。所以这些党派不管它们的花样有多少，都是属于资产阶级的。资产阶级所采取的这种两党制或多党制又是在被统治的人民大众面前蒙蔽资产阶级专政的实质的办法。这个执政的政党不得人心了，就换上另一个政党，表面上看来好像是顺应民意，很民主，实际上还是同样的资产阶级专政。反对党所以要对执政党大肆攻讦，也就是为了使人民以为反对党和执政党之间真有什么根本的区别，使人民在对执政党失望的时候把希望寄托到自己身上来。等到反对党变成执政党以后，它所执行的政策却仍旧不出原来的执政党那一套，而它在处于反对党地位时所说的许多漂亮话便只当是没有说过一样。有些资本主义国家也承认无产阶级政党有从事合法活动的自由，这是因为资产阶级无法脱离无产阶级而独立存在，而无产阶级的斗争也迫使资产阶级不能不承认无产阶级政党的合法地位。可是无产阶级政党虽然有了合法地位，资产阶级还是可以用种种方法来限制它，使它根本不能产生议员参加国会，或者只有个别候选人当选议员，在国会中起不了作用。即使无产阶级政党居然能在国会中获有较多的席位，也必然要因为所有资产阶级政党的联合抵制而不能不继续做在野党。一旦无产阶级政党的存在直接威胁到资产阶级的根本利益，那么，资产阶级就会用暴力手段来否认无产阶级政党的合法存在。所以资本主义国家的所谓两党制或多党制，不过是资产阶级专政的一个形式而已。
    无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政相反。无产阶级专政是劳动者多数对剥削者少数的专政，而不是少数人对多数人的专政。这样一个根本的不同，引起了民主制的全面的变革。在社会主义制度下，工人农民和其他劳动人民之间虽然还存在着某些不一致和矛盾，但是由于社会主义是他们的共同利益，他们都能够在工人阶级领导下为争取社会主义的胜利而奋斗，所以在他们中间形成了政治上的根本的一致性。这种一致性使劳动人民内部不会像资产阶级一样，分成各个不同的政治集团和政党，而工人阶级的政党——共产党便成为代表全体劳动人民的公共利益的政党。劳动人民在共产党领导下建立无产阶级专政，不是为了任何人的私利，而是为了最后消灭一切阶级差别，达到共产主义社会。这是一切进步人类所共有的伟大理想，只有无产阶级专政，亦即由无产阶级领导下的劳动人民掌握起国家权力来，才能使它实现。从事这样光明正大的事业的无产阶级专政根本用不着像资产阶级专政那样用各种方法来掩盖自己的实质，当然也就用不着仿效资产阶级所谓两党制或多党制的骗人的形式。
    我国人民民主专政实质上是无产阶级专政。但是我国还存在有各民主党派。这些民主党派在国民党统治时期多数都因为被排斥和被压迫，参加了共产党领导的反帝反封建统一战线。在国民党统治被推翻以后，民主党派由于承认实现社会主义是合乎中国社会发展规律的，愿意接受共产党领导，接受社会主义纲领，所以继续成为与共产党协商解决中国革命新时期中的各项问题的政治团体。共产党宣布了对待民主党派的长期共存互相监督的方针，要求它们在改造那些为它们所代表的民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员的过程中发挥积极的作用。我国民主党派不同于资本主义国家的反对党，因为它们和共产党的关系是领导者和被领导者的关系，这种关系的表现也不是一个在台上，一个在台下，而是都在台上，即民主党派在共产党领导下参与国家事务的管理。八年来的事实证明共产党的方针是正确的，民主党派在国家政治生活中发挥了它们的作用。
    醉心于资产阶级民主的人们企图把长期共存互相监督解释为资产阶级两党制，这是完全错误的。按照他们的想法，所谓在中国实行两党制，当然是指由代表工人阶级和劳动人民的共产党和代表民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的民主党派轮流执政。试想在欧美资本主义国家还只有资产阶级一个阶级的两党制，没有资产阶级和无产阶级的两党制，资产阶级从来不同无产阶级按照两党制办法轮流执政，而总是由它们内部的两党轮流执行着同一的或类似的维护资本主义的政策，难道在我们国家竟可以实行工人阶级和民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级的两党制么？显然是不可能的。资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的政党只是因为有共产党领导才拥护社会主义并把它当作自己的纲领，如果没有共产党领导，它们便会只有资产阶级民主纲领或社会改良主义纲领，而不可能从内部产生社会主义纲领。民主党派中有许多人是诚恳地接受共产党领导的，他们努力使自己接近共产党和劳动人民，并不要求实行两党制，而主张两党制的人尽管口头上说要走社会主义的路，心里却想要回到资本主义的路上去。他们说要两党制，实际上是想使民主党派脱离共产党领导，抛弃在共产党领导下采取的社会主义纲领。如果两党制能够实现，资本主义就跟着复辟了。劳动人民当然不可能有这样的“雅量”，一切拥护社会主义的人们也不可能有这样的“雅量”。
    可见两党制是行不得的。民主党派只有把它们自己同劳动人民联系在一起，坚决服从共产党领导，力求对社会主义事业有所贡献，才有真正的前途。但是很可能有人说，这样便只有长期共存，没有互相监督了。抱这种想法的人似乎认为必须民主党派和共产党处于对立地位才能实现互相监督。这是不对的。民主党派所以在我国社会主义事业中仍然成为一个积极的而不是消极的因素，正是因为它们不与共产党处于对立地位，在它们和共产党之间没有对抗性矛盾。所谓互相监督，也正是在这个条件下才有了可能。参与监督的人必须把建设社会主义当作他们和全体劳动人民的共同目标，凡脱离社会主义者监督之，凡对社会主义有妨碍者监督之，凡有官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义者监督之，才算是正确地发挥了监督的作用。如果发生脱离共同目标的分歧，便不得谓之监督，而谓之反对社会主义，谓之阶级斗争，必然使非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾。
    拥护资产阶级民主的先生们，还是把你们的纲领收起来罢，人民群众不能容忍两党制或多党制是完全合理的。
