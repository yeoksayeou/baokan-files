　　Newspaper Long-Term Promotion of Dogmatism
    Excerpts from the Speech of Lu Yi, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Shanghai Xinwen Ribao

    Many people criticize the articles in the newspapers as being full of dogmatism, like drawing talismans and chanting incantations, completely failing to address ideological problems. All day long, they put on a stern face and "lecture" people. The writers and readers are not in a position of "equality and friendship." I ask you, who wants to read your newspaper and be "lectured" every day? On the other hand, the long-term effect of lecturing also makes readers wait for instructions, experience summaries, conclusions, etc., from the newspapers, no longer thinking independently, and also becoming infected with a lot of dogmatism, which in turn rectifies the newspapers. For example, the Jiefang Ribao published an article by Fan Ruijuan, talking about her husband and her marriage. I don't see anything wrong with that, it can be published. But readers' letters poured in like snowflakes, meetings were held to discuss it, and joint protests were launched, as if the world was in chaos. For readers, this is also a kind of independent thinking, and it also shows the result of the newspaper's long-term promotion of dogmatism.

    Speaking of sectarianism, we must first admit in a realistic way that there has been a long-term history of "sharing weal and woe, sharing life and death" between the Party and some progressive journalists. Today, we are liberated. No matter how many shortcomings and mistakes our old intellectuals still have, and how much we need to continue to transform ourselves, the Party should not treat us as "outsiders." Unfortunately, in recent years, there is actually a wall, a ditch, and a layer of wooden boards between Party and non-Party journalists. First of all, we have to blame ourselves for not taking the initiative and actively approaching the Party. Secondly, the tradition of sectarianism within the Party must also be held responsible. With such ideological guidance, there will inevitably be a group of so-called "activists" who build walls, dig ditches, and create wooden boards. They rely solely on writing small reports and grasping ideas to get close to the Party. As a result, there is a wall, a ditch, and a layer of wooden boards between the Party and the masses. The Party's reliance on activists must have a standard. First, we must see whether he has truly closely contacted the masses and whether he has correctly reflected the opinions of the masses. Secondly, we must see whether he is really working conscientiously and studying honestly. We cannot just listen to his praises and enshrine him as an activist.

    In the few years since liberation, we have not cultivated many talents in the journalistic field, but many talents have been squeezed out by sectarianists and those who build walls, dig ditches, and make wooden boards. It is painful to say.

### 报纸长期推广教条主义  上海新闻日报副总编辑陆诒的言论摘要

　　报纸长期推广教条主义
    上海新闻日报副总编辑陆诒的言论摘要
    许多人批评报上的文章，一片教条主义，真像画符念咒，根本谈不到解决思想问题。整天板起面孔“训人”，写文章的人和读者之间，不是处于“平等、友好”的地位，试问谁愿意来看你的报纸，天天“受训”？另一方面长期训人的结果，也使读者专等报纸上的指示，经验总结，结论等等，不再独立思考，也沾染着不少教条主义，反过来整报纸。举例而言，解放日报登了一篇范瑞娟的文章，谈到她的丈夫和她的新婚，我看没有什么，也可以登吧。但是读者来信雪片纷来，开会讨论，联合抗议，好像天下大乱。在读者来说，这也是一种独立思考，也说明报纸长期推广教条主义的结果。
    谈到宗派主义，先要实事求是地承认，党和一部分进步的新闻界人士之间，有过长期“共患难，共生死”的历史关系。今天解放了，不管我们旧知识分子身上还有多少缺点，多少错误，需要继续进行改造，但是党总不应该把我们当做“墙外之人”。可惜，这几年来，党和非党的新闻界人士之间，竟然也有墙，也有沟，也有一层木板。首先也要怪我们自己不主动，不积极靠拢党。其次，党内宗派主义思想的传统，也要负责任。有这样一种思想指导，必然有一批所谓筑墙、开沟，创造木板的“积极分子”，他们专靠打小报告、抓思想来靠拢。于是党群之间有了墙、有了沟、有了一层木板。党对积极分子的依靠，要有一个标准。第一要看他是否真正密切联系了群众，是否正确反映了群众意见。其次要看他是不是真正在那里切切实实地在工作，老老实实的学习，不能光听他对你歌功颂德，即封他为积极分子。
    解放几年来，我们新闻界培养的人才还不多，但是被宗派主义者和那些筑墙、开沟、制造木板的挤掉的人才竟不少。言之痛心。
