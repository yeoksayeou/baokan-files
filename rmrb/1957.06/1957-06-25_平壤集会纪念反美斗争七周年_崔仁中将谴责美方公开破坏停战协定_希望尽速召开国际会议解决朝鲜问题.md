Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th — Pyongyang citizens from all walks of life held a rally at the Moranbong Theater tonight to commemorate the 7th anniversary of the "June 25th" Anti-American Struggle. Attending the rally were Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Kim Il and Park Ui-wan, heads of various democratic political parties and social organizations, officers of the People's Army, representatives of the working people, and more than eight hundred people.

Lieutenant General Cui Ren of the Korean People's Army delivered a report at the rally. He said that for the four years since the Korean armistice, the Korean-Chinese side has strictly abided by the armistice agreement; the government of the Republic has made every possible effort to consolidate the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the U.S. side has been violating the armistice agreement, creating provocative incidents, paralyzing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, expanding and strengthening the Rhee Syngman army, and frantically preparing for a new war. Recently, the U.S. openly announced the destruction of the armistice agreement, wanting to transport new types of weapons into South Korea and turn South Korea into a base of aggression. This action of the U.S. has aroused great anger among the Korean people.

Cui Ren emphasized that the Korean people firmly oppose the U.S. behavior of transporting new types of weapons into South Korea, and that the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, with the support of the socialist camp, will inevitably be able to crush U.S. military adventures.

The report pointed out that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the resolution of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference is the proper way to resolve the Korean issue. In his report, Cui Ren expressed hope for a prompt international conference with the participation of representatives from both North and South Korea to resolve the Korean issue.

Major General Ding Laifu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers, also spoke at the meeting as a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that since the armistice, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have been exemplary in abiding by the armistice agreement. The governments of China and Korea have made a series of significant efforts to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, U.S. imperialism and the Rhee Syngman clique have been flagrantly violating the armistice agreement and clamoring wildly for war. Recently, the U.S. imperialists unilaterally announced the abrogation of Article 13(b) of the armistice agreement, intending to transport atomic weapons into South Korea, attempting to permanently occupy South Korea and turn South Korea into an atomic war base for further aggression against China and Asia. This conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists will never succeed. If the U.S. imperialists continue to carry out such criminal acts of undermining peace and creating tension, they will inevitably be playing with fire and bring about their own destruction, suffering even greater defeats.

Ding Laifu said that we, the Chinese People's Volunteers, are determined to stand together with the Korean People's Army, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist behavior of destroying the armistice agreement, pay close attention to the development of the situation, maintain high vigilance, strictly guard our positions, and continue to strive to safeguard the implementation of the armistice agreement, defend the peaceful construction of China and Korea, strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

　　平壤集会纪念反美斗争七周年
    崔仁中将谴责美方公开破坏停战协定
    希望尽速召开国际会议解决朝鲜问题
    新华社平壤24日电　平壤市各界人士今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场举行大会，纪念“六·二五”反美斗争七周年。参加大会的有朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉，内阁副首相金一、朴义琓，各民主政党、社会团体的负责人，人民军军官、劳动人民代表等八百多人。
    朝鲜人民军中将崔仁在大会上作了报告。他说，朝鲜停战四年来，朝中方面严格地遵守停战协定；共和国政府为了巩固朝鲜停战和朝鲜问题的和平解决作了一切可能的努力。但是，美方却一直在破坏停战协定，制造挑衅事件，使中立国监察委员会陷于瘫痪，并且扩充和加强李承晚军队，疯狂地准备新战争。最近，美方公开宣布破坏停战协定，要把新型武器运入南朝鲜，并且把南朝鲜变为侵略基地，美国的这一行动引起了朝鲜人民的巨大愤怒。
    崔仁强调说，朝鲜人民坚决反对美国要把新型武器运入南朝鲜的行为，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在社会主义阵营的支援下必然能够粉碎美国的军事冒险。
    报告指出，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，在没有外国干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己来解决朝鲜问题，才是解决朝鲜问题的正当途径。崔仁在报告中表示希望尽速召开有南北朝鲜代表参加的国际会议来解决朝鲜问题。
    中国人民志愿军代表、中国人民志愿军政治部副主任丁莱夫少将也在会上讲了话。他说，停战以来，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一直模范地遵守停战协定。朝中两国政府对于促进朝鲜问题的和平解决作了一系列的重大努力。但是，美帝国主义和李承晚集团则一直粗暴地违反停战协定，疯狂叫嚣战争。最近美帝国主义者并且片面宣布废除停战协定第十三款卯项，要把原子武器运入南朝鲜，企图永久侵占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜作为进一步侵略中国和亚洲的原子战争基地。美帝国主义者这种阴谋诡计是决不能得逞的。美帝国主义者如果继续进行这种破坏和平、制造紧张局势的罪恶行为，它必将玩火自焚而遭到更大的失败。
    丁莱夫说，我们中国人民志愿军决心同朝鲜人民军一起，坚决反对美帝国主义破坏停战协定的行为。并且密切注意事态的发展，保持高度警惕，严守阵地，为维护停战协定的实施，保卫朝中两国的和平建设，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为保卫远东和世界和平而继续奋斗。
