Several Suggestions for the Development of Traditional Chinese Painting
Wu Huansun

Recently, a series of joyous events related to traditional Chinese painting have occurred: the National Youth Art Exhibition featuring nearly two hundred traditional Chinese paintings, the Chinese Painting Exhibition in Moscow, and the establishment of the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy.

From these joyous events, we cannot help but think of the integration of innovation and tradition in the artistic practice and theory of traditional Chinese painting over the years, and how many old masters have maintained a variety of elegant, pure, and diverse painting styles in their inheritance, learning, and mastery of traditional techniques of past dynasties. The art world knows that the rise and fall of traditional Chinese painting styles is what the national art scene expects, and it also attracts the attention of the art world in the East and the West. Therefore, everyone understands that the establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy has an influence on changing the atmosphere of the national painting world and plays a leading role. Everyone holds great expectations for it.

When talking about developing traditional Chinese painting and promoting national art, we feel heartbroken that in the past few decades when China was reduced to a semi-colonial country, a habit of blindly worshiping the West and despising oneself was formed in literature and art. In particular, those who lead art education are mostly those who study Western learning and paint Western paintings. In primary and secondary school art teaching, there are only pencil drawing and watercolor painting courses, so that young people in their twenties and thirties cannot even write with a brush, let alone paint traditional Chinese paintings. In recent years, in art schools, even the term "traditional Chinese painting" has disappeared, replaced by "color ink painting." I don't know whether it is intentional or unintentional, but it has created an atmosphere in which students despise traditional Chinese painting even more. Nineteen out of ten students are unwilling to learn it. Even the teachers hold a dismissive attitude towards the excellent traditions of traditional Chinese painting, regarding them all as feudal dross. This terrible storm almost uprooted the life of traditional Chinese painting. Only with the strong support of the Party and the government could it be revived. After the traditional Chinese painting world has received the irrigation of rain and dew, it must stretch its branches and leaves, bloom flowers, nurture new seedlings, and spread seeds, so that traditional Chinese painting can re-establish deep roots in the second generation, cultivate new buds, and make the development of national art better than the previous generation. How should we open up roads, how should we continue the past and usher in the future, and how should we carry on the tradition and start new things? As a researcher of traditional Chinese painting, I would like to briefly state a few words on these aspects.

(1) In terms of continuing the past and carrying on the tradition, and exploring the excellent traditions of painting techniques, we hope that some old masters who have mastered the techniques will abandon sectarian views, give up emotional disputes, cooperate and unite, learn from each other, express their opinions, and display their strengths. Use correct methods to write a history of the transmission of traditional Chinese painting techniques in addition to the history of Chinese painting; use critical methods to point out what is the essence and what is the dross in the painting techniques of past dynasties; elaborate on the brushwork, ink techniques, coloring methods of various schools, as well as the characteristics of their various styles, and explain how to learn from strengths, how to avoid weaknesses, how to master techniques, and how to repeatedly study, so as to be able to transform and create, and achieve innovation. This will help those who continue to learn to paint, so that they can avoid detours, easily master the techniques and theories of a certain school, and lay the foundation for their creation; at the same time, it will provide shortcuts for those who continue to research, and provide more scientific references. Why do we advocate this? Because most of the published art history and painting history only make some textual research on the evolution of painting, and rarely make analytical studies on the gains and losses of techniques. To make in-depth research in this area, the only way is to use the method of "collecting wisdom and benefiting from it," uniting the old masters, and asking those who have practical skills, have been immersed in it for many years, and have tasted the joys and sorrows to tell the secrets, point out the deep paths, show people the experience and how to use them flexibly, so as to avoid "beating around the bush" and wasting effort.

(2) In terms of opening up the future and inspiring posterity, art schools and traditional Chinese painting research organizations should adopt the apprenticeship system, pay attention to developing talent, and choose courses according to individual teaching, teaching students according to their aptitude, and respecting students' interests and hobbies. Why do we advocate this? Because for many years, all the courses in art schools have adopted the teaching methods of "equal treatment" and "average development," and have rarely created outstanding talents. The reason why outstanding talents have not been created is that, on the one hand, traditional Chinese painting has thousands of different styles in terms of techniques, and on the other hand, everyone has different talents and personalities in learning. Therefore, there are very complex contradictory problems such as "affinity to nature and lack of affinity to nature" and "suitability for learning and unsuitability for learning." Art education is different from other education. Letting a person learn what he loves can achieve twice the result with half the effort; on the contrary, letting a person learn what he is bored with will be difficult to achieve great success in his life. For example, a person who is naturally open-minded and has unrestrained brushwork is suitable for learning the freehand style of painting with large brushes; on the contrary, a person who is naturally cautious and has delicate brushwork is suitable for learning the meticulous realistic painting style. Such examples are countless. Taking drama teaching as an example, if you ask a talent who is suitable for singing painted faces to sing female roles, his performance is unimaginable. With the apprenticeship system, not only can teachers choose disciples, but students can also choose teachers. Let the learners learn what they are close to in talent. Only in this way can they specialize in practice with interest, can they be more refined, can they easily achieve great success, and can they cultivate outstanding talents.

(3) When it comes to how to popularize traditional Chinese painting art education, we insist that we must start with "re-sowing seeds" in primary and secondary school art teaching, so that traditional Chinese painting can take root and sprout in the second generation again, and make the future of traditional Chinese painting stronger than the previous generation. In order to do a good job in popularizing art teaching, we must first cultivate a large number of teachers so that teachers can master the techniques. At the same time, we should formulate traditional Chinese painting teaching materials. Correspondingly, we should produce paper, brushes, inks, paints and other supplies needed for painting traditional Chinese paintings. Before learning to paint, students must first practice calligraphy.

To complete such a task, we suggest that whether it is a traditional Chinese painting research organization or an art school, it should recruit experienced old masters and artists who have mastered new theories, cooperate with each other, carefully plan; formulate teaching materials from shallow to deep; cultivate a large number of primary and secondary school art teachers, and train art teachers. This is a delicate work that requires painstaking research.

(4) In terms of developing traditional Chinese painting creation, we hope that the government will also formulate award methods and selection methods for encouraging creation, just like it does for drama. At present, international cultural exchanges are frequent, and traditional Chinese painting already has a market abroad. The selected traditional Chinese paintings can be used for exhibitions and publications at home and abroad for promotion purposes.

At the same time, I have always believed that traditional Chinese painting has affirmed since the Tang and Song dynasties that "painting" "starts with rules and ends without rules." Looking at the paintings from the Song and Yuan dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, each generation has its own special style, each generation has its own unique customs, paying attention to creation and different appearances. Looking back at our modern traditional Chinese paintings, most of them have not well expressed the characteristics of this great era. Therefore, we hope that all artists will learn skills with theory and learn theory with skills. Combining reality, going deep into practice, participating in life, so that we can paint works with strong ideology, strong artistry, and long-term value. Let us work together to advance traditional Chinese painting to a new stage of prosperity.

### 发展国画的几点建议

　　发展国画的几点建议
　　吴幻荪
    近来发生了一连串有关国画的喜事：展出近二百件国画的全国青年美展的举行，在莫斯科的中国国画展的举行，北京中国画院的成立。
    由这些喜事，我们不能不联想到，多少年来国画在艺术实践和理论上的融新贯旧，多少位老画师们在师承传习上、在掌握历代传统技法上、保持着博雅醇正多种多样的画品风格。文艺界都知道，国画画风隆替，是全国艺坛所瞩望和引动着东洋西洋艺术界视听的。因此大家都理会到，中国画院的成立，对全国绘画界有着转移风气的影响和登高一呼的作用，大家对它怀抱着莫大的期望。
    在谈到发展国画、提倡民族美术之先，我们感到痛心的是：过去中国沦为半殖民地的几十年中，对文学艺术，已然养成一味崇拜西洋、鄙视自己的风气，特别是领导美术教育的人，率为学西学，画西画者。他们在中小学图画教学上，只有铅笔画、水彩画的课程，让二三十岁的青年，连毛笔字都不会写，更不用说画什么国画了。近年来，在美术学校里，也一古脑连国画的名词都不见了，改名为“彩墨画”，不知是有意还是无心，造成了学生更加鄙弃国画的风气，对国画十九不肯学习，甚至对国画的优良传统，由老师起就抱抹煞态度，一概视同封建糟粕。可怕的这一股风暴，险些把国画的生命连根拔除。只有在党和政府大力扶植下，才得重庆昭苏。国画界得着了雨露灌溉之后，要舒枝展叶，放出花朵，孕育新苗，散播种子，让国画在第二代中重新扎下深根，培出新芽，让民族美术的发扬，一代胜似一代。我们应当怎样开辟道路、怎样继往承先、怎样开来启后呢？作为一个国画研究者的我，愿就这几方面，略述数言。
    （一）在继往承先，发掘画法优良传统这一方面，我们希望一些掌握技法的老画师们，捐除门户之见，放弃意气之争，合作团结，相互琢磨，各抒所见，各展所长，用正确方法，在中国绘画史以外，再写出一本研究国画技法递嬗的历史；用批判方法指出历代画法中什么是精华、什么是糟粕；阐述各宗各派的笔法、墨法、设色法，以及它们各种风格的特点，说明如何取长、如何舍短、如何掌握技法、如何反复钻研，以至于能够蜕化创造，达到推陈出新。这样才能有助于继续学画的人们，让他们少走弯路，容易掌握某一画派的技法和理论，打下他们创作的基础；同时给继续研究的人们，辟出捷径，作出比较科学的参考。为什么这样主张呢？因为已出版的几本美术史、绘画史，多半只在绘画沿革上作些考证，而很少对技法得失作解剖研究。要在这方面作出精研，惟有用“集思广益”的办法，团结老画师们，请有过实践工夫，多年沉浸其中，饱尝甘苦的人，说出个中诀窍，指出深入途径，示人以经验之谈和怎样灵活运用的方法，才能免除“隔靴搔痒”和枉费力气。
    （二）在开来启后这一方面，美术学校和国画研究的组织，应当本着个别传授、因材施教和顺从学生志趣爱好来选择课业的原则，采用带徒弟制度，注意发挥天才。为什么这样主张呢？因为多年以来，所有美术学校的课目，都采取了“等量齐观”“平均发展”的教学方法，很少造就出杰出的人材。其所以造就不出人材的原故，一来是由于国画在技法上，有着千变万化的不同风格，二来是由于学习上，每个人都有着不同的天才和个性。因此严重的存在着“性之所近和天性不近”、“学之相宜和学之不宜”等非常复杂的矛盾问题。艺术教育，不同于其他教育，让一个人学习他所爱好的东西，才能事半功倍；反之，让一个人学习他所腻烦的东西，则终身难于大成。举例说，一个人天性开张，笔墨奔放，就宜于学大笔淋漓的写意画法；反之，一个人天性拘谨，笔墨精细，就宜于学习工整的写实画法。这种例子，是不胜枚举的。拿戏剧教学来说，如果叫一个宜于唱花脸的人材，去唱花旦，他的成绩，是不堪想像的。有了带徒弟制度，不但老师可以选择弟子，同时学生也可以选择老师。让学习的人，能够天才近什么，就学什么。这样有兴趣的专一练习，才能精益求精，才容易有大成就，才好培养出杰出的人材。
    （三）谈到如何普及国画美术教育这一方面，我们坚持必须在中小学美术教学上，从“再播种子”做起，重新让国画在第二代中生根发芽，让国画前途，一代比一代更强。为了办好普及美术教学，首先还须大量培养师资，让老师们能掌握技法。同时应制定国画教材。相应的生产画国画需要的纸张、笔墨、颜料等用具。学生在未学画前，要先练毛笔字。
    要完成这样任务，我们建议：国画研究组织也好，美术学校也好，应当征聘有经验的老画师，和掌握新理论的美术家，彼此合作，悉心规划；由浅入深，制定教材；大量培养中小学美术师资，调训美术教员。这是一件煞费研究的细致工作。
    （四）在开展国画创作这一方面，希望政府也像对戏剧一样，在鼓励创作上，订出评奖办法和选购办法。目前国际文化交流频繁，国画在国外已有了市场。选购的国画，可供国内外展览和出版提倡之用。
    同时，我始终认为，国画自唐、宋以来，已肯定“画”是“始于有法、终于无法”的。我们再旷观自宋、元迄明、清的绘画，是一代有一代的特殊风格，一代有一代特有的习尚，注重创造，面貌不同。返观我们现代的国画，大都没有很好地表现出这一伟大时代的特点。因此我们更希望所有的美术家们，有理论的学技巧，有技巧的学理论。结合现实，深入实际，参预生活，这样才能画出思想性强、艺术性也强、有长远价值的作品。大家一同携手，把国画推进到一个繁荣兴盛的新阶段。
