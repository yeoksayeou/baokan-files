Xinhua News Agency, 7th. How is the current national agricultural production situation? What issues should be paid attention to in the next stage? The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture met with Xinhua News Agency reporters today and answered this question.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture said that summer harvesting is now starting in various places, and rapeseed has been harvested. According to the information already available, the total national rapeseed production this year will increase by about three million dan compared to last year; wheat production is expected to increase in some provinces and decrease in others, with the total output estimated to be roughly the same as last year. This spring, there have been significant adjustments in the planting area of ​​grain and cash crops. The planting area of ​​rice has been slightly expanded compared to last year, and the planting area of ​​sorghum, millet, and some minor grains has increased; the planting area of ​​cotton, corn, soybeans, and other crops has decreased compared to last year.

Overall, many agricultural production tasks in the first half of this year were done more solidly and more in line with actual needs than last year. In particular, diversified management, planting according to local conditions, production preparations (seeds, agricultural tools, etc.), and leveraging the role of experienced farmers were done better this year than last year. The effective advanced experiences have been promoted on a wider scale, and more attention has been paid to adapting to local conditions than last year. This is mainly because agricultural cooperatives in various places have gained some management experience through last year's practice, and this spring they have been rectified, the scale of the cooperatives has been adjusted, the system of contracting work and output has been implemented, and attention has been paid to maintaining the independence of agricultural cooperatives in production and operation under the guidance of the national plan. At the same time, large numbers of cadres went to the countryside to participate in and lead production, which boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. These are all favorable conditions for agricultural production this year.

However, there are also some noteworthy problems in agricultural production in the first half of this year. For example, agricultural production still needs further coordination and support from relevant departments. The sales volume of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was lower in the spring than last year, the progress of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in some areas was slow, draft animals were thin, and excessive spring rain and cold weather in some southern areas and late thawing in the Northeast delayed planting time slightly. These are unfavorable factors in agricultural production this year.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture said that in order to strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year, many arduous tasks must still be carried out intensively in the next four or five months. The planting area of ​​cotton, soybeans, and some high-yield miscellaneous grain crops is smaller than last year, and to complete the production plan, greater efforts must be concentrated on increasing the yield per mu; at the same time, efforts should be made to ensure that all fields that should be replanted (returning crops) in the summer are planted with crops in a timely manner to increase the harvest area in the autumn. The harvest of spring tea and spring cocoons this year, as far as the country is concerned, is not as good as expected, which requires vigorous efforts to strive for increased production of summer and autumn tea and autumn cocoons.

In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest throughout the year, each agricultural production cooperative must mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources and use them properly in striving for a bumper summer and autumn harvest. In particular, attention should be paid to combining the self-reliance of the agricultural cooperative with the support of all parties to solve the problems of insufficient fertilizer and pesticides, weak draft animals, and other difficulties encountered in striving for a bumper harvest.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that the summer harvest is currently underway, and the summer planting is about to begin, which is a critical juncture for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest throughout the year. All localities must concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in summer harvesting and summer planting. In the period after summer harvesting and summer planting, field management should be done well, and full preventive preparations should be made for possible natural disasters in the second half of the year. At present and in the next stage, leading organs at all levels should also pay special attention to arranging work reasonably, so as to ensure that rectification and leadership of production are not neglected.

### 集中力量争取夏秋丰收  农业部负责人谈农业生产情况

    集中力量争取夏秋丰收
    农业部负责人谈农业生产情况
    新华社7日讯　当前全国的农业生产情况怎样？今后一个阶段应该注意那些事情？农业部负责人今天接见新华社记者，对这个问题作了解答。
    农业部负责人说，目前各地正在陆续开始夏收，油菜已经收割完毕。根据已经掌握的情况来看，今年全国的油菜总产量将比去年增产三百万担左右；小麦部分省份可望增产，部分省份将比去年减产，总产量估计大体与去年相等。今春，粮食和经济作物的播种面积调整较大，水稻的播种面积比去年略有扩大，高粱、小米和一些小杂粮的播种面积增加了；棉花、玉米、大豆等播种面积则比去年减少。
    总的来看，今年上半年许多农业生产工作比去年做得更踏实、更切合实际需要。特别是今年的多种经营、因地种植、生产准备（种子、农具等）、发挥老农作用等比去年做得好，有效的先进经验推广的面更大了，并且比去年更加注意因地制宜。这主要是因为各地农业社经过去年的实践已经取得了一些管理经验，今春又进行了整顿，调整了社的规模，实行了包工包产，注意保持农业社在国家计划指导下生产经营的独立性。同时，各地大批干部下乡参加生产、领导生产，鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。这些都是今年农业生产的有利条件。
  但是，今年上半年的农业生产也存在一些值得注意的问题，譬如农业生产还需要有关部门进一步的配合、支援，化学肥料、农药械春季的销售量比去年少，部分地区小型农田水利工程进度迟缓，耕畜瘦弱，南方部分地区春雨多气候冷、东北地区解冻较晚使播种时间稍有推迟等。这些是今年农业生产的不利因素。
    农业部负责人说，为了争取全年农业大丰收，在今后的四五个月内还必须紧张地做好许多艰巨的工作。棉花、大豆和某些高产杂粮作物都比去年种的少了一些，要完成产量计划就必须集中更大的力量去提高每一亩田地的产量；同时，要尽力把应当夏季复播（回茬）的田全部适时地种好庄稼，增加大秋收获面积。今年春茶、春茧的收获，就全国来看，也不像预期那样好，这就需要大力争取夏秋茶和秋茧增产。
    为了争取全年农业大丰收，每个农业生产合作社必须把一切人力、物力、财力动员起来，妥善地用在争取夏秋丰收方面，特别要注意把农业社自力更生和各方面支持的力量互相结合起来，解决肥料和药械不足、耕畜瘦弱、以及其他在争取大丰收中所遇到的困难。
    农业部负责人指出，目前，夏收正在进行，夏种即将开始，是争取全年农业大丰收的一个关头；各地必须集中力量搞好夏收夏种。夏收夏种后的一个阶段内，要做好田间管理工作，并对下半年可能发生的自然灾害作充分的预防准备。各级领导机关在当前和今后一个阶段内，还应特别注意合理安排工作，做到整风和领导生产两不误。
