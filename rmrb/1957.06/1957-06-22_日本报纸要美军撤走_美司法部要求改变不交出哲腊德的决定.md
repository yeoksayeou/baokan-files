　　Japanese Newspapers Demand US Military Withdrawal
    US Department of Justice Demands Reversal of Decision Not to Hand Over Girard
    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Tokyo dispatch: Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" said today that if American troops do not withdraw from Japan, there can be no talk of a new era in US-Japan relations.

    The newspaper made this demand while commenting on Nobusuke Kishi's statement in Washington. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi had stated in Washington that his talks with US leaders would open the way for a new era in US-Japan relations.

    "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that as long as foreign troops are stationed in Japan, there will be second and third "Girard incidents." As long as Japan still has to ask the United States to approve the relaxation of trade restrictions on China, a new era in US-Japan relations is impossible.

    The newspaper pointed out that a new era in relations between the two countries is only possible when the United States and Japan are truly on an equal footing. If this so-called new era in US-Japan relations is to be one of continuing to follow the United States, it is dangerous. It said: We do not want the beginning of such a new era.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Washington dispatch: The US Department of Justice demanded on the 20th that the Supreme Court reverse the Federal District Court's order that the US government must not hand over Girard, the American soldier who killed a Japanese person in Japan, to the Japanese authorities for trial.

    The Department of Justice demanded that the Supreme Court take immediate action on this issue.

　　日本报纸要美军撤走
    美司法部要求改变不交出哲腊德的决定
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本“读卖新闻”今天说，如果美国的军队不从日本撤走，就谈不上什么日美关系的新时期。
    这家报纸是在评论岸信介在华盛顿的声明时提出这个要求的。日本首相岸信介曾经在华盛顿发表声明说，他同美国首脑的会谈将为日美关系的新时期开辟道路。
    “读卖新闻”说，只要外国军队驻在日本，就会发生第二、第三次“哲腊德事件”。只要日本还不得不要求美国批准放宽对中国的贸易限制，日美关系的新时期是不可能开始的。
    这家报纸指出，只有美国同日本能够名符其实地处于平等地位，才有可能开始两国关系的新时期。假如这个所谓日美关系的新时期将是一个继续追随美国的新时期，那是危险的。它说：我们不希望这样的新时期的开始。
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国司法部20日要求最高法院改变联邦地方法院作出的关于美国政府不得把在日本杀人的美国兵哲腊德移交给日本当局审判的命令。
    司法部要求最高法院就这个问题立即采取行动。
