　　Who Says There Are No Rightist Statements Today?
　　--Introducing Some Strange and Absurd Arguments Emerging in the Rectification Campaign in Tianjin--
    Huang Xinping proposed:
    Power should be rotated among all political parties. The Communist Party and the democratic parties should all withdraw from schools.
    “Since the Party is a tool of class struggle, and class struggle in the country has basically ended, can the leading role of the Party be weakened a bit?” Huang Xinping, a teacher at Tianjin Municipal Third Girls' Middle School, raised this question. He answered it at a symposium. He said, "Since democratic parties are allowed to exist, and the programs of each democratic party require them to move towards communism, why can't a system of rotating power among the parties be implemented? If the Communist Party does not want one-party rule, but wants the Communist Party and all parties and factions to propose different political programs, allowing the masses to choose freely, this can stimulate the Communist Party and the democratic parties to work hard to overcome shortcomings to win voters' votes and serve the people." He believed, "This is an opinion that touches on the interests of the Communist Party. The question is whether the Communist Party is willing to give up power." Finally, he put forward another opinion: "The Party and the democratic parties should not stay in schools. I doubt whether the organizations of the Party and the democratic parties in schools can promote the progress of school work, because the presence of the Party and the democratic parties in schools easily leads to factionalism and creates disunity. Therefore, the Party and the democratic parties should withdraw from schools, and only allow schools of thought to exist, which can promote the development of schools and academic work."
    Rong Zizheng proposed:
　　Marxist-Leninist theories were all written in earlier periods, and many places don't match up when applied to China.
    Rong Zizheng, a standing committee member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, proposed: "The application of Marxism-Leninism in China does not match up in many places. The Party handles the issue of the national bourgeoisie in China based on Marxism-Leninism, carrying out comprehensive and long-term economic and political struggles, resulting in too much loss and the downfall of capitalists. The theoretical works of Marxism-Leninism were all written in earlier periods, and when these theories are applied to China, many places don't match up. For example, in political economics, it is said that after independent laborers rise to become exploiters, the original funds are quickly spent, and then they gain without labor." Rong Zizheng said, "The Chinese national bourgeoisie is not like that. We are hardworking and diligent, earning more and spending less. Moreover, after we rise to become exploiters, we do not enjoy the fruits of our labor without working, but are more burdened with labor. Therefore, when we study political economics, we hear it but don't believe it and cannot accept it."
    Hu Zonghan proposed:
    Let the democratic parties govern in a province, city, or district.
    Hu Zonghan, a staff member of the Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau, suggested that the Communist Party could let the democratic parties govern in a province, city, or district, and give them the legal system and police, allowing the democratic parties to experiment with governing for a period of time to see if they can serve the people."
    Li Peiying proposed:
    Revolution is worse than changing dynasties. Intellectuals are living in fear every day, more uneasy than during the period of occupation and the Kuomintang period.
    Li Peiying, a member of the Democratic League and an engineer at the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute, said: "When the Communist Party first entered Tianjin, it said that this was a revolution, and our revolution was not just changing dynasties. But now it seems that it is worse than changing dynasties. Living in this society is heartbreaking. Intellectuals are living in fear every day, more uneasy than during the period of occupation and the Kuomintang period."
    Yang Yu proposed:
    After the constitution was promulgated, the country's democratic system regressed even more.
    Yang Yu, another engineer at this design institute, said: "After the constitution was promulgated, our country's democratic system regressed even more. He said that before the constitution was promulgated, the government was like a coalition government, but now it has kicked away all the democratic parties."

　　谁说今天没有右派言论？
　　——介绍在天津整风运动中出现的一些奇谈怪论——
    黄心平提出：
    应由各党派轮流执政。共产党和民主党派都应退出学校。
    “既然党是阶级斗争的工具，现在国内阶级斗争已经基本结束，党的领导作用是不是可以削弱一点？”天津市立第三女子中学教师黄心平提出了这样的问题。他在一个座谈会上对此作了解答。他说：“既然允许民主党派存在，各民主党派的党纲又都要求走向共产主义，为什么不可以实行各政党轮流执政的办法呢？如果不要共产党一党执政，而要共产党和各党各派提出不同的政纲来，由群众自由的选择，这样做可以刺激共产党和各民主党派不得不努力克服缺点来博得选民的选票，为人民服务。”他认为：“这是一个触及共产党利益的意见，问题是共产党肯不肯放弃政权。”最后他又提出了另外一个意见：“党和民主党派不应该留在学校里。学校里有党和民主党派的组织，是不是可以推动学校工作的进展，我很怀疑。因为学校里有党和民主党派，就容易产生宗派主义，制造不团结。因此，党和民主党派应该退出学校。而只容许学派存在，这就能推动学校和学术工作的发展。”
    荣子正提出：
　　马列主义的理论都是很早时期写成的，搬到中国来，很多地方对不上号。
    天津市工商业联合会常委荣子正提出：“马列主义在中国运用很多地方对不上号。党对中国民族资产阶级问题，都是根据马列主义办事，进行全面的和长期的经济和政治斗争，结果损失太大，资本家倒下了。马列主义的理论著作都是很早时期写成的，把这些理论搬到中国来运用，很多地方对不上号。譬如政治经济学里说，独立劳动者上升为剥削者之后，原来的资金很快花光，然后则不劳而获。”荣子正说，“中国民族资产阶级则不然。我们是勤劳苦干，赚的多，花的少。而且在我们上升为剥削者之后，也不是坐享其成不劳而获，而是操劳更重。因此，我们学政治经济学很多地方是听而不信，不能接受。”
    胡宗翰提出：
    让民主党派在一个省市或区里执政。
    天津市机电工业局科员胡宗翰建议，中国共产党可以让民主党派在一个省、市或区里执政，并给他法制和警察，让民主党派试验着执政一个时期，看看是否能为人民办事。”
    栗培英提出：
    革命比改朝换代更坏。知识分子一天天提心吊胆，比在沦陷时期和国民党时期还不安静。
    民主同盟盟员、天津民用建筑设计院工程师栗培英说：“共产党刚进天津时曾说过这是革命，我们的革命不是改朝换代。但是现在看来，比改朝换代更坏。生活在这个社会里叫人很伤心。知识分子一天天提心吊胆，比在沦陷时期和国民党时期还不安静。”
    杨棫提出：
    宪法颁布后，国家的民主制度越发倒退了。
    这个设计院另一个工程师杨棫说：“宪法颁布后，我们国家的民主制度越发倒退了。他说宪法颁布以前，政府倒像个联合政府，而现在却把各民主党派一脚踢开了。”
