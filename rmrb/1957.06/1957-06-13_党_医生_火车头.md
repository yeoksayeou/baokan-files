　　Party · Doctor · Locomotive
　　Gao Zhi
    A doctor treats others' illnesses, but he himself can also get sick. This sickness might be a cold or constipation, just a dysfunction in a certain part of his body, not a problem with the doctor's whole body. And it certainly doesn't mean that if a doctor gets sick, he's going to die. When a doctor gets sick, he can treat it behind closed doors or openly. Once the doctor has cured his own illness, he can still treat others.
    If someone thinks a doctor shouldn't get sick, that's wrong. If someone thinks a doctor is bound to die if he gets sick, that's even more wrong.
    A locomotive pulls a train of carriages, but the locomotive itself can also have problems. This problem might be in the boiler or on the wheels, just a problem in a certain part of the locomotive, not a problem with the locomotive as a whole. And it certainly doesn't mean that if the locomotive has a problem, it has to be scrapped. If the locomotive has a problem, it can be repaired, either a minor repair or a major overhaul. Once the locomotive has been repaired, it can still pull a train of carriages.
    If someone thinks a locomotive shouldn't have problems, that's wrong. If someone thinks a locomotive is bound to be scrapped if it has a problem, that's even more wrong.
    Now, there is a doctor who has cured a major illness, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal disease. He is still treating illnesses, treating the economic backwardness disease and the cultural backwardness disease. The doctor has caught a cold and is treating himself. Some people say that a doctor with a cold can no longer treat others and that the doctor himself is bound to die. Is this true?
    Now, there is a locomotive pulling a train of carriages, along the track of Marxism-Leninism, heading from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal station towards the socialist station, and from the socialist station towards the communist station. The locomotive has a minor problem and is being inspected. Some people say that a locomotive with a minor problem cannot pull a train and that the locomotive is bound to be scrapped. Is this true?
    This doctor is the Chinese Communist Party. This locomotive is the Chinese Communist Party. Some Party members having some problems does not mean the entire Party has problems. And it's not surprising that some Party members have problems.
    Now the Party is carrying out rectification. Not concealing illness, not refusing treatment. This spirit is wise and great. All those who love the Party should point out all the problems of certain Party members, tell all the deviations of certain Party members, and reveal all the serious mistakes of individual Party members. We should help the doctor cure his own illness, so that the doctor can more wholeheartedly treat the economic backwardness disease and the cultural backwardness disease of a large country with a population of 600 million. We should help the locomotive with its inspection, so that the locomotive can more safely and quickly pull the train carrying 600 million passengers towards the prosperous and strong socialist station, towards the more prosperous and stronger communist station.
    We need this doctor, we need this locomotive. We are willing to trim the doctor's nails at any time and clean the locomotive's chimney. Trimming the nails is not cutting off the doctor. Cleaning the chimney is not scrapping the locomotive.
    Doctor, locomotive, thinking of the 600 million people, thinking of thousands of generations; the people should also think of the 600 million people themselves, thinking of their descendants. A gentle breeze and drizzle can also change, but it should change into a spring breeze that nurtures, not into a violent storm.

　　党·医生·火车头
　　高植
    医生是替别人治病的，他自己也会害病。这病或是感冒，或是便秘，这只是他的身体的某一部分有了失调的现象，并不是医生全身都有毛病。更不是医生有病，一定要死。医生有了病，可以关门治疗，也可以公开治疗。医生治好了他的病，还可以替人治病。
    假若有人认为医生不应该害病，这是不对的。假如有人认为医生害病，就一定要死，这更不是对的。
    火车头是拖一列车厢的，火车头本身也会有毛病。这毛病或是锅炉里的，或是轮子上的，这只是火车头的某一部分有毛病，并不是火车头全部有毛病，更不是火车头有了毛病，一定要报废。火车头有了毛病，可以小修，也可以大修。火车头修好了，还可以拖一列车厢。
    假如有人认为火车头不应该出毛病，这是不对的。假如有人认为火车头出了毛病，就一定要报废，这更是不对的。
    现在，有一个医生，他治好了一种大病，半殖民地半封建症，他还在治病，治经济落后症、文化落后症。医生感冒了，在替自己治病了。有人说，得了感冒的医生不能再替人治病了，而且医生自己一定要死了，这话对吗？
    现在，有一个火车头，他拖着一列车厢，沿着马克思列宁主义的轨道，从半殖民地半封建站向着社会主义站奔去，还要从社会主义站向共产主义站奔去。火车头有了点小毛病，在检修了。有人说，有了小毛病的火车头不能拖列车了，而且火车头一定要报废了。这话对吗？
    这医生是中国共产党。这火车头是中国共产党。党内一部分党员有了些毛病，并不等于全党有毛病。而且一部分党员有毛病，也是不足为怪的事。
    现在党整风了。不讳疾，不忌医。这种精神是英明伟大的。凡是爱党的人都应该把某些党员的毛病全指出来，把某些党员的偏差全说出来，把个别党员的严重错误全揭开来。我们应该帮助医生治好他自己的病，为了让医生更能专心一志地治疗六亿人口大国的经济落后症、文化落后症。我们应该帮助火车头检修，为了让火车头能够更安全地、更迅速地把乘坐六亿旅客的列车向着繁荣富强的社会主义站奔去，向着更繁荣、更富强的共产主义站奔去。
    我们需要这个医生，我们需要这个火车头。我们愿意随时替医生剪剪指甲，替火车头打扫烟囱。剪剪指甲，不是剪掉医生。打扫烟囱，不是扫掉火车头。
    医生、火车头，为六亿人民着想，为千秋万岁着想；人民也应该为六亿人民自己着想，为子子孙孙着想。和风细雨也可以变，但是应该变为春风化雨，而不是变为狂风暴雨。
