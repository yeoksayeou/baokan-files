　　This newspaper reports that many agricultural cooperatives in Henan and Hubei provinces have accumulated a lot of experience in feeding grazing animals in a decentralized manner.

　　**Carefully Select Herdsmen**

　　One of the main experiences of Xuchang Special District in Henan Province is that herdsmen must be carefully selected. Separate trough feeding is tantamount to handing over the power of deciding the life and death of cattle to the herdsmen. If the herdsmen are not good, even if the method of decentralized feeding is good, it will still not avoid the weakness and death of cattle. In some cooperatives, nearly half of the livestock died because the herdsmen were not good. In some cooperatives, the phenomenon of "cattle crying and pigs laughing, herdsmen stealing feed" has existed for a long time, and the cattle have lost a lot of weight. Some herdsmen in cooperatives had never even fed pigs before, and the mortality rate of the livestock assigned to them was very high. What kind of person is good to be a herdsman? Xuchang's experience proves that a good herdsman should be ideologically progressive, loyal and reliable, selfless, love the cooperative as his home, have skills, have experience, and love livestock. Good herdsmen should be democratically elected by the members of the cooperative. Sihe Township put a flower of glory on the democratically elected herdsmen, which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for raising cattle well.

　　**Strengthen Feeding Management**

　　The experience of decentralized livestock feeding in many areas also proves that strengthening feeding management is an important condition for feeding cattle well. The main links in strengthening feeding management are: first, improve the quota management system for feeding cattle and using cattle. The more common system is the "seven fixings," namely: 1. Fix the cattle, herdsmen, and users, so as to achieve fixed people and livestock, and unified raising and use; 2. Fix grass and feed. Some cooperatives give the grass and feed costs to the herdsmen for free disposal. Some cooperatives give the herdsmen the grass and feed needed for the whole year for overall arrangement and adjustment. Some cooperatives regularly issue grass and feed to the herdsmen; 3. Fix the utensils for feeding cattle and the farm tools for using cattle. Some cooperatives stipulate a time limit and contract for use. If damaged or lost within the stipulated time limit, the individual is responsible; 4. Fix the livestock condition; 5. Fix the farm work, according to the physical strength of the cattle, stipulate how much land to cultivate or how much other farm work to do every day, and do not allow excessive use, so as to maintain the cattle; 6. Fix the conception, protection, reproduction, and survival rate of breeding female livestock of the right age; 7. Fix the work points for feeding and the work points for using cattle. This avoids the chaotic situation of feeding and using. Second, establish precautions for feeding and using cattle. Liu Yanzhuang Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, in order to ensure the safety of grazing animals, implemented the "five no-harness" system, namely: do not harness cattle if they are not well-fed, do not harness them if they have not rested, do not harness them if they are sick, do not harness them if they have just mated, and do not harness them before and after delivery. Some cooperatives have stipulated a "five diligence" system in order to ensure the health of cattle, namely: be diligent in mixing grass and feed, be diligent in drinking water, be diligent in brushing the troughs, be diligent in padding the beds, and be diligent in removing manure. These easy-to-understand technical operation requirements are effective and the masses are satisfied. Third, establish and adhere to the reward and punishment system. At present, there are basically two types of reward and punishment methods currently used in various places: one is to fix the amount of reward and punishment according to the increase or decrease of livestock condition. For example, the Youhao Cooperative in Sihe Township stipulates that each livestock that rises one grade will be rewarded with five yuan; each livestock that falls one grade will be fined five yuan; each small livestock that is bred will be rewarded with five yuan. The other is to first value the livestock according to the market price, and then evaluate it according to the market price at that time during the evaluation. The increase is rewarded by commission, and the decrease is punished according to the percentage; the young livestock bred are regularly (half a year or a year) valued and rewarded by commission; the breeding female livestock of the right age are punished as appropriate if they are empty without reason.

　　**Frequently Conduct Livestock Love Education**

　　To ensure that the cattle are fed well in a decentralized manner, it is also necessary to frequently conduct ideological education among the members of the cooperative on loving livestock, protecting livestock, and increasing livestock. Ideological education must be combined with reality. After Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, used the method of calculating the accounts of planting land and raising livestock to clarify the relationship between livestock and cooperative members and the important role of livestock in production, some cooperative members automatically helped the herdsmen transport soil to cushion the pens on rainy days. Eight townships including Fokou in Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, held cattle evaluation conferences by region, which not only exchanged feeding experience and rewarded model herdsmen, but also encouraged the cooperative members' enthusiasm for caring for cattle.

    分散喂养耕畜怎样才能喂好？
    河南湖北等省许多农业社积累了不少经验
    本报讯　河南、湖北等省的许多农业社已经积累了不少分散喂养耕畜的经验。
    认真挑选饲养员
    河南省许昌专区的主要经验之一是：必须认真挑选饲养员。分槽喂养，就等于把耕牛的生死予夺之权交给了饲养员。饲养员不好，即使分散喂养的办法再好，仍然不能避免耕牛的瘦弱死亡。有些社因为饲养员不好，牲畜死亡将近一半。有些社长期存在“牛哭猪笑，饲养员偷料”的现象，耕畜掉膘很多。有些社的饲养员，过去连猪也没喂过，分给他喂的牲畜，死亡率很高。什么人当饲养员为好？许昌的经验证明，好饲养员应该思想进步，忠实可靠；大公无私，爱社如家；有技术，有经验，爱护牲畜。好的饲养员应该由社员民主选举产生。四合乡给民主选出的饲养员戴上光荣花，大大鼓舞了他们养好耕牛的积极性。
  加强饲养管理工作
    许多地区分散喂养牲畜的经验还证明，加强饲养管理工作是喂好耕牛的重要条件。加强饲养管理工作的主要环节是：第一，健全喂养耕牛和使用耕牛的定额管理制度。这种制度比较普遍的有“七固定”，即：一、固定耕牛、饲养员和使用人，以此做到人、畜固定，养、用统一；二、固定草、料。有的社把草、料费交给饲养员自由支配。有的社把全年需用的草料交给饲养员统筹安排，调剂使用。有的社定期发给饲养员草和料；三、固定喂养耕牛的用具和使用耕牛的农具。有的社规定期限，包干使用。在规定期限以内损坏或遗失，由个人负责；四、固定畜膘；五、固定农活，根据耕牛的体力强弱，规定每天耕多少地或做多少其他农活，不许使役过度，以便保养耕牛；六、固定适龄繁殖母畜的受胎、保胎、繁殖、成活率；七、固定喂养的工分和使用耕牛的工分。这样，就避免了喂养和使用的混乱情况。第二，建立喂养和使用耕牛的注意事项。河南省长葛县刘彦庄社，为了保证耕畜的安全，实行了“五不套”制度，即：耕牛喂不好不套，歇不过来不套，有病不套，刚配犊不套，产前产后不套。有的社为了保证耕牛的健康，规定了“五勤”制度，即：勤拌草料，勤饮水，勤刷槽，勤垫铺，勤出粪。这些通俗易懂的技术操作要求，行之有效，群众满意。第三，建立和坚持奖惩制度。目前各地现行的奖惩办法，基本上有两种：一种是按畜膘的增减固定奖惩金额。如四合乡友好社规定，每头牲畜上升一等膘奖五元；下降一等膘罚五元；繁殖一头小牲畜奖五元。另一种是先把牲畜按市场的价格作价，评比时再按当时的市场价格评价，增的抽成奖励，减的按成处罚；繁殖的幼畜定期（半年或一年）作价抽成奖励；适龄繁殖母畜无理由空怀，酌情处罚。
  经常进行爱畜教育
    保证把耕牛分散喂养好，还必须经常对社员进行爱畜、保畜、增畜的思想教育工作。思想教育必须与实际结合。陕西省武功县前进一社，用种地、养牲畜算账对比的方法，讲清牲畜同社员的关系和牲畜对生产的重要作用之后，有些社员在下雨天就自动地帮助饲养员运土垫圈。山西省左权县佛口等八个乡分片举行耕畜评比大会，既交流了饲养经验，奖励了模范饲养员，又鼓舞了社员爱护耕畜的情绪。
