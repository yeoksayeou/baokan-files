    Hoping Mr. Long Yun Visits Our School
    Editor's Note: In his speech at the United Front Department's symposium, Mr. Long Yun mentioned the No. 101 Middle School (see page 2 of this newspaper, May 31st). Our newspaper has since received eight letters from readers explaining the situation at this middle school. We are now selecting one for publication here. Reader's Letter
  Editor:
      The People's Daily published Mr. Long Yun's speech at the symposium invited by the Central United Front Department on May 31, 1957. He criticized the cultivation of children of cadres and mentioned our No. 101 Middle School. As students of No. 101 Middle School, we would like to offer some simple explanations for some of the unrealistic statements.
    Mr. Long Yun said: "I heard that there is an affiliated middle school of Beijing Normal University, which is now renamed No. 101 Middle School. The students are all children of high-ranking cadres, and other students are not admitted. This is unfair." Yes, if this were the case, we would also feel it was unfair. But this is not the case. Our school was indeed a school for children of cadres in the past, but that was two years ago, and not all of them were children of high-ranking cadres (children of high-ranking cadres account for less than one-fifth). We have children of revolutionary martyrs and orphans. Many of our classmates grew up with their parents in the revolutionary ranks after their parents joined the revolution; some were orphaned and fostered in the countryside; some became shepherd boys and "enjoyed" the landlord's whip; some became vagrants, wandering around and living a dark and hopeless life like cattle and horses; some were forced to be old-fashioned apprentices, and almost every day they had to taste the master's slap. Many are students who fled from the Kuomintang areas to the old liberated areas. We still clearly remember Premier Zhou's words of encouragement when he inspected our school in 1954: Cadres' children should not be special. They should learn the fine revolutionary traditions of the revolutionary martyrs, learn from the children of the masses, and learn their habits of loving labor and their frugal lifestyle. He also taught us that we should better integrate with the people. After Premier Zhou left, we discussed Premier Zhou's speech in depth and unanimously agreed with the Premier's speech. Soon after, our school was changed into an ordinary middle school.
    In order to help Mr. Long Yun and others understand the truth, it is necessary to briefly explain the history of our school. Our school can be said to be a product of the revolution. Our school was established in Zhangjiakou in 1946, then called "Zhangjiakou Municipal Middle School". Later, as the war approached Zhangjiakou, the school moved with the army to Xihuangni Village in Jianping County, Shijiazhuang, Fuping County, and other places. When leaving Zhangjiakou, many children of the masses dropped out of school. In the combat years of fighting against the enemy, cadres were transferred very frequently. In order to centrally manage the children of revolutionary cadres, the school (then called North China Yucai Middle School) was changed to a school for children of cadres in the summer of 1948. After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, the school moved to Beijing and merged into the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University, renamed the Second Department of the Affiliated Middle School of Normal University. In 1955, after the salaries of all government workers in the country were changed to a salary system, the school was changed to an ordinary middle school in accordance with the instructions of the Central Ministry of Education, and was placed under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, renamed "Beijing No. 101 Middle School." Before this, our parents were all on the supply system, and we had no money to enter other middle schools, and our parents were often transferred, so we had to apply for this middle school. This is why our school is a school for children of cadres.
    Mr. Long Yun also said: "Students trained by such schools will definitely feel superior and will definitely have privileged ideas, which is also detrimental to the students. I heard that capitalist monarchical countries have schools for the nobility and aristocrats, and ordinary people are not admitted at all. Why should our socialist country also set up similar aristocratic schools? I think this is just a moment of excitement and a lack of comprehensive consideration." If our parents were all riding on the heads of the people and acting as overlords or nobles, and we were all young masters and sons of rich men, and the people pointed their fingers at us and cursed us, it would be the least deserved rebuke. But we would like to briefly say how we have lived since we entered Beijing. We know the difficulties of the country and do not want the country to spend more money on us. We built the campus on the ruins of Yuanmingyuan with our own hands. Our classmates and teachers leveled the rubble-filled, potholed areas into playgrounds and built several roads. We planted 10,000 trees on campus. We have a system where each student works for one hour on campus every two weeks. Last summer vacation, each person was also required to return to school for two to four labor sessions. The students planted 20 mu of biological garden on campus, which solved part of the vegetable problem. The vegetables eaten by our teachers were entirely grown by themselves. Many of the current classrooms are built using old stones from Yuanmingyuan. The toilets are pit latrines, and you have to walk a long way to wash your face. These facilities and living conditions are far from comparable to many newly built middle schools in the city. The education we receive is about how to serve the people. The future of each of us is closely linked to the future of the people. The series of victories the people have achieved in socialist construction are the driving force that encourages us to progress. During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and in the years of joining the army, we were the most enthusiastic to sign up and the most numerous to enlist; some students have already dedicated their precious lives to the revolution. Among our classmates, there are also a few younger students in the lower grades who have not been tempered by the harsh revolutionary environment and do not know the difficulty of material resources. For these young students, we are exerting collective strength and often helping teachers to educate them, and each of us is constantly vigilant against the emergence of such ideas.
    Finally, I hope Mr. Long Yun has time to come to our school to see the truth and offer us criticism.

### 希望龙云先生到我们学校看看

    希望龙云先生到我们学校看看
    编者按：在统战部座谈会上发言中，龙云先生曾提到了一○一中学的问题（见本报5月31日第二版），本报先后收到读者来信八件，说明这个中学的情况。现在选登一件在这里。读者来信
  编辑同志：
      1957年5月31日人民日报登载了龙云先生在中央统战部邀请民主人士的座谈会上的发言。他对干部子弟的培养问题提出了批评，并且提到了我们一○一中学，作为一○一中学学生的我们，对其中一些不切合实际的发言，在此做一些简单的解释。
    龙云先生说：“听说北京师范大学有个附中，现在改为一○一中学，学生完全是高级干部子弟，其他的学生就不收，这样是不公道的。”是的，如果事实是这样的话，那我们也觉得是不公道的事情。但事实并非如此。我们学校过去的确是干部子弟学校，但这已是两年以前的事了，而且也并不都是高级干部子弟（高级干部子弟连五分之一也占不到）。我们有革命烈属和孤儿。我们有许多同学在父母参加了革命之后，有的是随着父母在革命队伍里长大的；有的是变成孤儿寄养在乡下；有的变成了放羊娃，“享受”着地主手里的鞭子；有的变成流浪儿到处颠簸过着暗无天日的牛马般的生活；有的被迫当过旧式的学徒，几乎每天都要尝师傅的耳光。有很多是从国民党地区流亡到老区的学生。我们还清楚地记得1954年周总理在视察我校时，勉励我们的话：干部子弟不应该特殊化，应学习革命先烈优良的革命传统，向群众子弟学习，学习他们热爱劳动的习惯和俭朴的生活作风。他还教导我们应该更好地和人民打成一片。周总理走后，我们深入地讨论了周总理的谈话，一致同意总理的谈话，以后不久我们的学校就改成了普通中学。
    为了帮助龙云先生和别人了解真相，这里还得简单地说一下我们学校的历史。我们的学校可以说是革命的产物。我们学校是1946年在张家口成立的，当时叫“张家口市立中学”，后来战火迫近张家口，学校随军迁移到建屏县西黄埿村、石家庄、阜平县等地。在迁离张市的时候，许多群众的子弟都退学了。在过去那种对敌斗争的战斗年代中，干部调动极为频繁，为了对革命干部子女集中管理，1948年暑假才把学校（当时叫华北育才中学）改为干部子弟学校。1949年北京解放后，学校又迁来北京，并入北京师范大学附属中学，改名为师范大学附属中学二部。到1955年全国政府工作人员的待遇都改为薪金制以后，学校遵照中央教育部指示，改为普通中学，并划归北京市教育局领导，更名为“北京市第一○一中学”。在这以前我们的父母都是供给制，我们进别的中学又没有钱，我们的父母又经常调动工作，我们只好投考这个中学。这就是我们学校为什么是干部子弟学校的由来。
    龙云先生又说：“像这种学校培养出来的学生一定会感到高人一等，一定会有特权思想，于学生也是不利的。资本主义的君主国家听说有贵胄学校、贵族学校，平民一概不收，为什么我们社会主义国家，也要设这种类似的贵族学校呢？我想来这也是一时高兴，缺乏全面考虑的结果。”如果我们的父母都是骑在人民头上作威作福或是贵族，我们都是一些少爷、公子哥儿之流，人民指着鼻子骂我们，是起码应有的斥责。可是我们想简单地说一下，我们进了北京以后究竟是怎样生活的。我们知道国家的困难，不愿让国家花更多的钱在我们身上。我们用双手在圆明园的一片废墟上修建了校园，我们同学和老师把满是碎石、坑洼不平的地方平整成操场，修筑了好几条道路，在校园内植了一万株树木。我们有每两周每个同学在校内劳动一小时的制度。去年暑假里，每人也还规定返校劳动二到四次。同学在校内种了二十亩生物园，解决了一部分吃菜问题，我们老师吃的菜，完全是自己种的。现在的许多教室都是利用圆明园的旧石块盖起来的，厕所是毛坑，洗脸要走很远的路，这些设备和居住条件，比起城内许多新建的中学来，是相差很远的。我们所受的教育是要我们如何去为人民服务，我们每个人的前途是和人民的前途紧紧地连在一起的，人民在社会主义建设中所取得一系列的胜利都是鼓舞着我们进步的动力。抗美援朝和历年参军的时候，我们都是报名最踊跃的，入伍也是最多的；有的同学已经为革命献出了自己的宝贵生命。在我们同学当中，也有少数低年级里年纪较小的同学，没有受过艰苦革命环境的锻炼，不太知道物力艰难。对于这些小同学，我们正在发挥集体力量，经常帮助老师教育他们，我们每个人也随时警惕这种思想的产生。
    最后，希望龙云先生有空到我们学校来看看，了解真相，并且对我们提出批评。
