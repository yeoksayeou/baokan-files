    Support the Anti-American Struggle of the Taiwanese People
  　Tune: Qin Yuan Chun
    Huang Shaohong
    Murder goes unpunished, Liu Ziran, protests are silent. Listen, silence speaks volumes, eight years of occupation, a thousand grievances, ten thousand evil deeds. Raise your arms and shout, all of Taiwan opposes America, is killing one American soldier the only beauty? A tidal wave, right, spreading throughout the world, filling Taiwan and Penghu.

    Divine thunder hides its traces. And joyfully listen to the earth-shattering thunder. Look, the police and gendarmes on the spot, dazed like wooden puppets, watching with folded arms, seemingly sympathetic. Foolish policies defend the people, weapons are useless, Chen Sheng's rebellion overturned the Qin Emperor's court. To liberate, yes, six hundred million compatriots, supporting from across the sea.

    支援台湾人民反美斗争
  　调寄沁园春
    黄绍竑
    杀人无罪，刘奥特华，抗议无声。听。无声诉出，八年霸占，千般积恨，万恶罪行。振臂高呼，全台反美，岂仅杀人一美兵。狂潮浪，正。播传寰宇，弥漫台澎。
    神雷隐迹潜形。且喜听轰天霹雳鸣。看。当场宪警，痴如木偶，旁观袖手，显似同情。愚政防民，甲兵无用，陈涉竿颠秦帝庭。殷解放，有。同胞六亿，隔海支撑。
