Xinhua News Agency, 17th - Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, today gave a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the erroneous statements made by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others. He also called on the entire league to unite and wage a resolute struggle against anti-Party and anti-socialist statements and actions.

    Shen Junru said: "Regarding the affairs of the China Democratic League, I have been less involved in recent years due to poor health, but I am responsible. The China Democratic League held a national working conference in March of this year. Since then, Vice Chairmen Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have been more involved in the league's work. I originally thought this was a good thing, but who knew they had ulterior motives. Recently, I saw erroneous statements by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others in the newspapers, and I am very indignant. The day before yesterday, Zhang Bojun suddenly came to see me outside the city and told me that there was a lot of criticism of him outside, saying that he was an ambitious person, anti-Party, a double-dealer, a rightist, and so on. He said, 'I accept these criticisms. I haven't studied enough and have made mistakes. I ask everyone to help me.' Zhang is an old friend of mine for many years, but now he has actually made such anti-Party and anti-socialist statements. Because he is a leader of the China Democratic League, his erroneous statements have affected the whole country, and I am very heartbroken.

    I remember that Chairman Mao taught us at the beginning of the liberation in 'On the People's Democratic Dictatorship' that we should 'lean to one side,' that is, lean to the side of socialism, without exception. Now some people doubt or oppose socialism, which is really hateful. Zhang Bojun said that he has admitted his mistakes, but it is important to know that correcting mistakes depends on oneself. I don't think he has truly recognized his mistakes now. Luo Longji is still abroad. I will also ask him to conduct a thorough self-criticism after he returns.

    We are about to convene an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League to clarify the political stance of the China Democratic League, which is to resolutely take the socialist road, support the leadership of the Communist Party, and support the people's democratic dictatorship. We must also criticize the erroneous statements of Zhang, Luo, and others. We must call on all comrades in the league to unite and wage a resolute struggle against anti-Party and anti-socialist erroneous statements and actions."

　　沈钧儒就民盟政治方向发表谈话
　　他说：章伯钧还没有真正认识错误  罗隆基回国后也应彻底检查
    新华社17日讯　中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒今天就章伯钧、罗隆基等发表错误言论的事情，向新华社记者发表了谈话，并号召全盟团结起来，向反党反社会主义的言论和行动进行坚决的斗争。
    沈钧儒说：“关于民盟的事，我近年来由于身体不好，过问得很少，但是我是有责任的。本年3月民盟开了全国工作会议，以后章伯钧、罗隆基两位副主席对盟务工作管得比较多，这件事我原以为是好的，谁知道他们别有用心。最近在报上看到章伯钧、罗隆基等的错误言论，非常愤慨。前天章伯钧忽然到城外来看我，告诉我外面对他的批评很多，说他是野心家、反党、两面派、右派等等。他说‘这些批评我都接受，我学习不够，犯了错误，要求大家帮助。’章是我多年老友，现在居然发表这种反党反社会主义的言论，由于他是民盟领导人，他的错误言论影响全国，我非常痛心。
    记得毛主席在解放之初就在‘论人民民主专政’里教导我们应当‘一边倒’，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。现在有些人对社会主义怀疑或反对，真是可恨。章伯钧说他已承认错误，要知道改过是要靠自己的，我看他现在还没有真正认识他的错误。罗隆基现还在国外，他回来后我也要他作彻底的检查。
    我们就要召开民盟中常会扩大会议，明确民盟的政治立场，这就是坚决走社会主义的道路，拥护共产党的领导，拥护人民民主专政，还要批判章、罗等人的错误言论。我们要号召全盟同志团结起来，向反党反社会主义的错误言论和行动进行坚决的斗争。”
