　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 13th: The state of Kerala in India has abolished the past practice of handcuffing prisoners. An order issued by the Kerala state government yesterday also announced that no demeaning or insulting markings would be imposed on prisoners, such as requiring prisoners to wear prison uniforms or cutting their hair short.
    The Kerala state government has taken these measures to implement its effective prison reform policy. It is reported that the past conditions in the prisons were appalling and cruel.
    The Kerala state government has also appointed a committee, chaired by the minister in charge of prison affairs in the state government, to revise the rules of Kerala prisons.
    Various newspapers here have reported on this reform by the Kerala state government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 12th: The Kerala state government has announced revisions to the wage scales for transportation workers in Kerala. The minimum wage for transportation workers in the state has now been increased from 20 rupees to 30-50 rupees per month.
    The thousands of transportation workers in Kerala work very hard but live in poor conditions. They have long been fighting for their demands to increase their wages. When the Praja Socialist Party was in power in Kerala in 1954, a workers' demonstration was shot at. This incident caused a great uproar and ultimately led to the collapse of the Praja Socialist Party government.

　　印喀拉拉邦政府续施仁政
    实行监狱改革　改善工人生活
    新华社新德里13日电　印度喀拉拉邦已经废除过去给囚犯带手铐的做法。喀拉拉邦政府昨天颁发的命令还宣布，对囚犯不再施加有损人格或侮辱性的标记，如给犯人穿著囚服或者剪短发之类。
    喀拉拉邦政府采取这些措施是履行它的有效的监狱改革政策。据报道，过去监狱的情况是可怕和残忍的。
    喀拉拉邦政府还任命一个以邦政府负责监狱工作的部长为主席的委员会来修改喀拉拉邦监狱的规则。
    此间各报都报道了喀拉拉邦政府的这种改革。
    新华社新德里12日电　喀拉拉邦政府已经宣布修改喀拉拉邦运输工作人员的工资等级。邦内运输工作人员的最低工资现在已经从每月二十卢比增加到三十至五十卢比。
    喀拉拉邦的成千上万的运输工作人员工作非常辛苦，而生活过得很坏。他们长期以来一直在争取实现他们提高工资的要求。当人民社会党1954年在喀拉拉邦执政时，有一次工人示威曾遭枪击。这件事引起了一场大风潮，最后促使人民社会党政府垮台。
