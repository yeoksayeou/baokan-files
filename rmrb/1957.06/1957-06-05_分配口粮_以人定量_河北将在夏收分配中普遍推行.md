Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 2nd: Hebei Province will universally implement the method of "determining quantities based on individual needs" to calculate grain consumption standards in this year's summer harvest distribution. This decision was made at the meeting of Communist Party Committee Secretaries and Commissioners on grain work, which concluded on May 31st. The meeting criticized the provincial-level leading organs for not paying attention to farmers' opinions on average grain distribution per capita in a timely manner and for not attaching importance to the promotion of the method of determining quantities based on individual needs. It pointed out that this is the key to correctly resolving the contradiction between the state and agricultural cooperatives, and between the cooperatives and their members, in the current summer harvest distribution.

Hebei Province suffered from floods last year, and the grain supply was relatively tight. In order to prepare early to appropriately resolve this contradiction in the summer harvest distribution work, a summer harvest distribution meeting was held in late April. However, many grassroots cadres and agricultural cooperative members in various counties resisted the summer harvest distribution tasks, stating that the consumption standard of 100 jin for surplus grain cooperatives and 90 jin for grain-deficient cooperatives for the three months of July to September was not enough to eat, and that more labor could not lead to more gains. Surplus grain cooperative members requested to retain more and purchase less, without adequately considering the needs of the state.

After full discussion at the meeting, it was considered that: in terms of consumption standards, "90 jin and 100 jin" are appropriate as the state's general estimated figures for the cooperatives, but when it comes to the specific distribution to members by each cooperative, the past practice of average grain distribution per capita must not be repeated. The method of determining quantities based on individual needs should be universally implemented, and the excess part beyond the quantity determined for individuals can be distributed in the spirit of "more pay for more work" under the principle of distribution according to labor. In addition, appropriate consideration was also given to the request of members of surplus grain cooperatives to retain more, without affecting the state's purchase of the grain needed to supply the grain-deficient people in urban and rural areas.

The meeting studied the current grain shortage in Hebei Province, the reduced production due to disasters in this year's summer harvest (especially in the northern regions), and the continued grain shortage from July to September. It emphasized that cadres at all levels must unify their thinking and understanding, and do a good job of propaganda and organization work among the people. They should explain the reasons clearly, clarify the policies, rely on the grassroots, rely on the masses, verify the output, and earnestly promote the method of distribution based on individual needs.

The meeting also noted the possible waste of grain after the summer harvest, and required cadres at all levels to repeatedly explain to the grain-deficient people in urban and rural areas and the broad masses of farmers the importance of continuing to conserve grain, and not to eat and drink extravagantly just because the new wheat has come down.

    分配口粮“以人定量”
    河北将在夏收分配中普遍推行
    新华社保定2日电　河北省在今年夏收分配工作中，将普遍推行“以人定量”的方法计算粮食消费标准。这是在5月31日结束的中共地委书记、专员粮食工作会议上决定的。会议上批判了省级有关领导机关没有及早注意农民对平均按口计粮的意见，没有重视以人定量方法的推广。指出，这是正确解决当前夏收分配中国家和农业社、社员矛盾的关键。
    河北省去年遭受水灾，粮食供应上比较紧张，为了及早准备在夏收分配工作中适当解决这个矛盾，在4月下旬就召开了夏收分配会议。但是，有许多县基层干部和农业社社员对夏收分配任务有抵触，提出7至9月三个月消费标准余粮社一百斤、缺粮社九十斤不够吃，多劳不能多得；余粮社社员要求少购多留，对国家需要考虑不够。
    会议上经过充分讨论以后，认为：在消费标准方面，“九十斤、一百斤”作为国家对社的一般预计数字是合适的，但具体到每个社对社员具体分配时，决不能再重复过去平均按口计粮的作法，应普遍推行以人定量办法，并且除以人定量外的多余部分，可本着按劳分配“多劳多得”的精神进行分配。另外，在不影响国家购到供应城乡缺粮人民需要的粮食原则下，对余粮社社员要求多留也作了适当照顾。
    会议研究了河北省当前粮食紧张，今年夏收又将因灾减产（特别是北部地区），7至9月份粮食仍然紧张等情况，强调必须各级干部统一思想统一认识，作好对人民群众的宣传和组织工作。讲清道理，说明政策。依靠基层，依靠群众，核实产量，切实推行以人定量的分配方法。
    会议还注意到夏收后可能发生的粮食浪费问题，要求各级干部反复向城乡缺粮人民和广大农民群众说明继续节约用粮的重要意义，不要看到新麦下来了，就大吃大喝。
