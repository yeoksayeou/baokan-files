Which Class Standpoint Should a Newspaper Take?
Reactions of Shanghai Newspapers to This Newspaper's Editorial
    This newspaper dispatch Following the publication of this newspaper's editorial, "Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Direction for a Period," it has aroused widespread reactions among some newspapers and readers in Shanghai. The Liberation Daily, Labor Daily, Xinmin Evening News, Wenhui Daily, and News Daily have respectively published editorials or articles, examining their newspaper management policies and criticizing the bourgeois news viewpoints of some journalists.
    Bourgeois Newspaper Management Ideology Exposed in This Sharp Struggle
    Wenhui Daily successively published editorials on the 14th and 16th, titled "Clarify Direction and Continue to Advance" and "Welcome Supervision and Assistance," expressing acceptance of this newspaper's criticism. In its first editorial, Wenhui Daily stated: "In a recent short period, our work did indeed have significant shortcomings and errors." However, in analyzing the reasons for the shortcomings and errors, Wenhui Daily's editorial stated that it was due to "our one-sided and erroneous understanding of the Party's 'letting go' and 'contending' policies, believing that unconditionally encouraging 'letting go' and 'contending' was helping the Party conduct rectification; publishing more positive opinions or conducting counter-criticism of erroneous opinions would affect 'letting go' and 'contending'. As a result, as pointed out in the People's Daily article, our newspaper, in a recent short period, 'published a large number of articles expressing bourgeois viewpoints without preparing to criticize them and provocative reports.'" Wenhui Daily's editorial stated that their ideas and practices were "completely subjective and erroneous. The reason why these erroneous understandings occurred is that the bourgeois newspaper management ideology still remaining in our minds was exposed in this sharp class struggle."
    Wenhui Daily's second editorial acknowledged that in a period when class distinctions still exist in the world, newspapers are always tools of class struggle; capitalist countries shy away from this truth, but bourgeois newspapers, despite their different appearances, are essentially promoting capitalism and are tools for the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat. Newspapers in our socialist country are newspapers that promote proletarian thought and represent the interests of the people. Our various newspapers can and should have their own characteristics, but the above-mentioned basic direction must be consistent. Wenhui Daily believes that the reason for the errors that occurred in the newspaper in the past period was "using an objective news viewpoint to edit the newspaper, which inevitably favored the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat in the class struggle." Wenhui Daily said: "How to run newspapers well in socialist China, this question is not completely clear among some journalists, so there are still countless problems in specific work; after the problems of dogmatism, formalism, and generalization have been reduced, bourgeois news viewpoints have grown in some areas. The mistakes made by Wenhui Daily in the past short period are a prominent example." Wenhui Daily said: The People's Daily's suggestion to launch a discussion on news work issues is very necessary. They expressed that they will conduct in-depth investigations and participate in this discussion.
    Wenhui Daily also published a letter from Bao Anyue, an employee of the Fruit Company, to the editorial department on the 14th. This reader criticized the newspaper's recent attitude of "taking a completely objective approach to those distorted speeches, and also taking a purely objective approach to those good speeches, seemingly treating them equally."
    Resolutely Fight Against the Bourgeois Newspaper Management Tendency
    Shanghai News Daily published an editorial on June 16 titled "Resolutely Fight Against the Bourgeois Newspaper Management Tendency," which stated: "If you carefully look through the newspapers of the previous period, including this newspaper, you can see the shadow of the bourgeois newspaper direction in many places between the lines, but the degree of concentration is different." The editorial pointed out: "Originally, there were also some people in the press circles who had their own 'unique' views on the meaning of letting go and contending. They did not want to 'let flowers bloom' but to 'set fires,' not to 'let a hundred schools of thought contend,' but to let one school dominate." The editorial also pointed out that Lu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of News Daily, once borrowed the words of others to say: "The articles in the newspaper are full of dogmatism, really like drawing symbols and chanting spells, and there is no way to solve ideological problems." This completely erased past achievements. After analyzing these situations, the editorial pointed out: This bad trend should arouse the attention and vigilance of all our colleagues in the press, and resolutely fight against this dangerous trend.
    What Standpoint Should a Socialist Newspaper Take?
    Shanghai Xinmin Evening News also published Lin Fang's "Sincerely Requesting Help" essay on the 16th. The article said: The article published by the People's Daily editorial department is a timely education and a timely warning to the vast number of journalists. This article once again raises a fundamental question to us: What standpoint should a socialist newspaper take when speaking, and for which class should it speak? Should it be a mouthpiece for the bourgeoisie or a mouthpiece for the working class? When talking about Xinmin Daily's newspaper management thinking, Lin Fang said: "In the process of specific practice, there is a tendency to relax vigilance against bourgeois ideology because of anti-dogmatism; because of cooperating with the great letting go and contending, there is a situation of not criticizing certain fallacies in a timely manner and being ambiguous about the stand of struggle; because of emphasizing that propaganda should proceed from the actual situation of readers, some things that are for the sake of fun have appeared." When talking about how to maintain the due characteristics of non-Party newspapers, the article said: "We must put seeking common ground—the basic direction, class standpoint, viewpoint, and commonality of newspapers—in the main position, and put the characteristics of newspapers in the secondary position. Any characteristics must be subordinate to the basic direction of socialist newspapers."
    Some People Attempt to Confuse the Party Spirit of Newspapers with Dogmatism
    Shanghai Labor Daily also published He Xiao's "What Standpoint Is This Taking?" on the 16th, criticizing Lu Yi's bourgeois newspaper management thinking, deputy editor-in-chief of News Daily, and questioning Lu Yi's fallacy that "newspapers have long promoted dogmatism." The article proposed that Lu Yi attempted to confuse the Party spirit of newspapers with dogmatism and Party jargon in order to achieve his goal of negating the fundamental principles of the people's and Party spirit of the People's Daily and imposing bourgeois newspaper management thinking on today's people's newspapers, so that it deviates from the track of serving socialist construction.
    Some People's News Viewpoints Differ from Socialist News Principles
    Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 16th titled "Running a Newspaper Must Have a Standpoint," pointing out that "some people in the Shanghai press circles have differences in news viewpoints from the principles of socialist news undertakings, and have spread a lot of bad influence in a recent period." The editorial conducted a strict criticism of some of the speeches of Comrade Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University. Wang Zhong once emphasized: The newspaper is a tool for spreading news. It can serve politics, but it is not politics itself. Wang Zhong also believes that newspapers have two aspects, "one is a propaganda tool, and the other is a commodity, and it plays the role of a propaganda tool on the basis of commodity attributes." The editorial criticized Wang Zhong's bourgeois news viewpoint, pointing out that Wang Zhong erased the class nature of newspapers and believed that using class viewpoints to educate the people was an old habit and an erroneous argument for deviating from the masses. The editorial said that according to Wang Zhong's statement, after the elimination of classes, newspapers cannot be said to be tools of class struggle, and newspapers have no class nature. At that time, there is no difference between socialist newspapers and bourgeois newspapers. After the elimination of classes, do newspapers not have the mission of educating the people to eliminate bourgeois ideology? Don't socialist newspapers have their own characteristics?
    The Liberation Daily editorial also pointed out: In the Shanghai press circles, there are indeed some people who denounce guidance as "dogmatism" whenever they talk about it. For example, Lu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of News Daily, once scolded the people's newspapers for "a piece of dogmatism" and "really like drawing symbols and chanting spells" and other fallacies. The editorial believes that if one does not admit that the newspaper is a tool of class struggle, opposes the guidance of the newspaper, and blindly indulges in business-mindedness, the result can only be to resist the guidance of Marxism and accept the guidance of the bourgeoisie.

### 站在什么立场办报？上海各报对本报编辑部文章的反应

　　站在什么立场办报？
　　上海各报对本报编辑部文章的反应
    本报讯　本报编辑部文章“文汇报在一个时间内的资产阶级方向”发表以后，在上海的一些报纸和读者中引起了广泛的反应。解放日报、劳动报、新闻日报、文汇报、新民报晚刊等分别发表社论或文章，检查办报方针，批判一些新闻工作者的资产阶级新闻观点。
    资产阶级办报思想，在这场尖锐的斗争中暴露出来了
    文汇报在14日和16日先后发表了题为“明确方向，继续前进”和“欢迎督促和帮助”的社论，表示接受本报的批评。文汇报在第一篇社论中说：“在最近一个短时期内，我们的工作的确有很大的缺点和错误。”但是在分析产生缺点和错误的原因的时候，文汇报社论说，它是由于“我们片面地、错误地理解了党的‘鸣’‘放’政策，以为只要无条件的鼓励鸣放，就是帮助党进行整风；多登正面的意见或者对错误的意见进行反批评，就会影响‘鸣’‘放’。结果，正如人民日报的文章所指出的，我报在最近一个短时期内‘发表了大量表现资产阶级观点而并不准备批判的文章和带煽动性的报道。’”文汇报的社论说，他们的那些想法、做法，“完全是主观的、错误的。而所以发生这些错误认识，是因为我们头脑中还残存着的资产阶级办报思想，在这一场尖锐的阶级斗争中暴露出来了。”
    文汇报的第二篇社论承认，在世界上还存在着阶级区分的时期，报纸总归是阶级斗争的工具；资本主义国家讳言这个真理，但资产阶级的报纸尽管面目各有不同，实质上都是宣扬资本主义，都是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的工具。我们社会主义国家的报纸，都是宣传无产阶级思想、代表人民利益的报纸，我们各种报纸都可以而且应该有自己的特色，但上述的基本方向必须是一致的。文汇报对于该报过去一个时期内发生错误的原因，认为是
  “以客观主义的新闻观点来编辑报纸，结果必然在阶级斗争中有利于资产阶级对无产阶级的进攻”。文汇报说：“如何办好社会主义中国的报纸，这个问题在一部分新闻工作者中间并没有完全明确，因此在具体工作中还是心中无数的；教条主义、公式化、一般化的毛病减少后，资产阶级新闻观点又在某些方面滋长了，文汇报在过去一个短时期所犯的错误，就是一个突出的例子。”文汇报说：人民日报建议就新闻工作问题展开讨论，是十分必要的。他们表示将进行深入检查，并参加这次讨论。
    文汇报在14日还发表了果品公司职员包安岳给编辑部的信，这位读者对近来该报“对那些歪曲言论完全采取客观报道，对那些好的言论，也采取纯客观报道，似乎一视同仁”的态度，提出了批评。
    坚决同资产阶级办报的倾向作斗争
    上海新闻日报6月16日发表的“坚决地同资产阶级办报倾向作斗争”的社论中说：“如果仔细翻一翻前一个时期的报纸，包括本报在内，在不少地方，都可以从字里行间看到资产阶级报纸方向的阴影，不过浓淡的程度有所不同。”社论指出：“原来新闻界中也有若干人，对放、鸣的涵义，有他们自己‘独特’的见解，他们不是要‘放花’而是要‘放火’，不是要‘百家争鸣’，而是要一家独鸣。”社论又指出，新闻日报副总编辑陆诒曾借他人之言说：“报纸上的文章，一片教条主义，真像画符念咒，根本谈不到解决思想问题。”这样一笔勾销了过去的成绩。社论在分析了这些情况之后指出：这种不良倾向应引起我们全体新闻界同仁的注意和警惕，坚决地同这种危险的倾向作斗争。
    社会主义报纸应当站在什么立场
    上海新民报晚刊16日也发表了林放的“诚恳地要求帮助”的随笔。文中说：人民日报编辑部发表的这篇文章，对于广大的新闻工作者是个及时的教育，及时的警钟。这篇文章又一次向我们提出一个根本性的问题：社会主义的报纸应当站在什么立场上说话，为哪一个阶级说话？做资产阶级的喉舌还是做工人阶级的喉舌？林放谈到新民报的办报思想的时候说：“在具体实践的过程中，因为反教条主义而放松了对资产阶级思想的警惕性，这一种倾向是有的；因为配合大鸣大放而对某些谬论不及时批判，暧昧了斗争的立场，这种情况也是有的；因为强调宣传要从读者实际出发而出现一些为趣味而趣味的东西，这也是有的”。文章在谈到如何保持党外报纸应有的特色时说：“要把求同——基本方向、阶级立场、观点、报纸的共性——放在主要的地位，而把报纸的特点放在次要的地位。任何特点必须服从社会主义报纸的基本方向。”
    有人企图把报纸的党性和教条主义混淆起来
    上海劳动报也在16日发表了贺晓的“这是站在什么立场上？”一文，批判新闻日报副总编辑陆诒的资产阶级办报思想，对陆诒曾说过的“报纸长期推广教条主义”的谬论提出质问。文章提出陆诒企图把报纸的党性和教条主义、党八股混淆起来，以达到他否定人民纸报的人民性、党性的根本原则的目的，把资产阶级办报思想强加在今天人民报纸的头上，使它离开服务于社会主义建设的轨道。
  有一部分人的新闻观点与社会主义的新闻原则有分歧
    上海解放日报16日发表了题为“办报要有立场”的社论，指出“上海新闻界有一部分人在新闻观点上是与社会主义新闻事业的原则有分歧的，而且在最近一个时期中散布了不少的不良影响。”社论对复旦大学新闻系主任王中同志的一些言论进行了严格的批判。王中曾强调说：报纸是传布新闻的工具，他可以为政治服务，但不是政治本身。王中还认为报纸有两重性，“一重是宣传工具，一重是商品，而且是在商品性的基础上发挥宣传工具的作用”。社论批判了王中这种资产阶级的新闻观点，指出王中抹杀了报纸的阶级性，认为拿阶级观点去教育人民就是旧习惯，就要脱离群众的错误论调。社论说，照王中的说法，阶级消灭以后，报纸就不能说是阶级斗争的工具了，报纸就没有阶级性了，到那时候，社会主义报纸与资产阶级报纸就没什么区别了。难道阶级消灭以后，报纸就没有教育人民消灭资产阶级思想的使命了吗？难道社会主义报纸没有它的特色了吗？
    解放日报社论还指出：在上海新闻界中，确有一些人一谈到指导性就斥之为“教条主义”，像新闻日报副总编辑陆诒就曾谩骂人民的报纸为“一片教条主义”，“真像画符念咒”等谬论。社论认为如果不承认报纸是阶级斗争的工具，反对报纸的指导性，盲目热中于生意眼，其结果只能是抗拒马克思主义的指导，接受资产阶级的指导而已。
