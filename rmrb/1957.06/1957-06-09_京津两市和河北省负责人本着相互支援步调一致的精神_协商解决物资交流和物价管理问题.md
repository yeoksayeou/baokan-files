Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Yesterday, the vice mayors of Beijing and Tianjin, Cheng Hongyi and Song Jingyi, and the vice governor of Hebei Province, Ma Li, jointly negotiated in Beijing on how to solve the existing problems in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the management of market prices in the three regions.

These three leaders unanimously agreed that Hebei Province and Beijing and Tianjin have extremely close economic ties, and that economic work must be carried out in the spirit of mutual support and mutual consideration, and strive to achieve consistency in pace, in order to more correctly handle the contradictions in the people's economic life. In the past few years, Hebei Province and Beijing and Tianjin have used methods such as holding meetings, mutual visits, and holding material exchange meetings, and the urban-rural relationship has been basically normal; however, a regular contact system has not been established, so that there are still some inconsistencies and uncoordinated cooperation in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the management of market prices. For some commodities, there are large regional price differences, and in some areas, certain materials are artificially blockaded. Therefore, in this consultation, they focused on discussing these issues.

On the mutual support of materials between urban and rural areas, the three provinces and cities all believe that it is necessary to strengthen the combination of production and sales of industrial and agricultural products, and various contracts and agreements can be established through consultation to connect the main and bulk materials in planning. Agricultural products acquired and distributed within Hebei Province should give priority to supporting Beijing and Tianjin as much as possible, and allocate a certain production base for raising pigs to the two cities; the industrial products of Beijing and Tianjin should maintain normal supply to Hebei Province.

In terms of market management and prices, in the past, except for the unified management of goods purchased and sold under unified plans, the unified acquisition of goods was seriously affected due to inconsistent management calibers. This also caused price confusion. It is hoped that unified management can be gradually achieved through consultation in the future.

In solving specific economic problems, in order to enable relevant departments in the three regions to communicate with each other, in the future, when any one place comprehensively deploys financial and economic work, the other two places should actively send cadres to participate in order to understand the situation in a timely manner. It is also stipulated that in the future, the administrative heads of the three regions will jointly study the current problems in material supply once every quarter. Now the three regions have decided to send special teams to sort them out according to the severity and urgency of the problems, starting in mid-June, and study them one by one; those that need to be solved urgently will be solved immediately, and those that are more complicated, cannot be solved for a while, and have little impact will be solved gradually.

    京津两市和河北省负责人本着相互支援步调一致的精神
    协商解决物资交流和物价管理问题
    新华社7日讯　昨天，北京市副市长程宏毅、天津市副市长宋景毅和河北省副省长马力，在北京共同协商如何解决三个地区城乡物资交流和市场物价管理中存在的问题。
    这三位负责人一致认为，河北省和北京、天津两市，在经济上有极密切的联系，经济工作必须本着相互支援互相照顾的精神，尽量取得步调上的一致，才能较正确地处理人民经济生活中的矛盾。几年来，河北省和京、津两市运用开会、互相访问和召开物资交流会等方式，城乡关系基本上是正常的；但是没有建立经常联系制度，以致在城乡物资交流和市场物价管理中，还存在一些互不衔接，配合失调的现象，有些商品，地区差价较大，有的地区某些物资形成人为的封锁。因此，在这次协商中，他们着重讨论了这几个问题。
    在城乡物资的相互支援上，这三个省、市都认为，必须加强工业农业产品的产销结合，可以通过协商建立各种合同和协议，把主要和大宗的物资从计划上衔接起来。由河北省内掌握收购和分配的农产品，尽量优先支持京、津两市，并划给两市一定的生产生猪的基地；京、津两市的工业品应保持对河北省的正常供应。
    在市场管理和价格上，过去除了统购统销物资有统一管理以外，对统一收购的物资，由于管理口径不一，曾严重地影响了收购任务的完成，并造成价格的混乱，今后希望能通过协商，逐步统一管理起来。
    在解决具体经济问题时，为使这三个地区有关部门互通声气，今后任何一地全面部署财经工作时，其他两地要主动互派干部参加，以便及时了解情况，并规定今后每一季度，三个地区的行政负责人共同研究一次当前物资供应中的问题。现在这三个地区已决定互派专门小组，从6月中旬开始，将根据问题的轻重缓急，进行排队，逐一研究；凡急需解决的，立即解决，问题较复杂、一时不能解决、影响又不太大的，将逐步解决。
