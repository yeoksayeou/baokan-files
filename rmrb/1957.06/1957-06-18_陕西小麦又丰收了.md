Shaanxi Wheat Harvest Again

(Our newspaper dispatch) A scene of abundance is everywhere in the villages of Shaanxi Province. At present, the summer harvest work in this province has entered a tense stage. The 4.1 million mu of wheat in the southern mountainous areas of Shaanxi have been basically harvested and are now being threshed. On the Guanzhong Plain, the main wheat-producing area of Shaanxi Province, more than 16.57 million mu of wheat have been harvested, accounting for more than 70%. In the Yan'an and Yulin areas of northern Shaanxi, more than 3.7 million mu of wheat mature later and are now beginning to be harvested. It is estimated that all of it can be harvested by the end of this month.

"This year is another bumper harvest year," is the unanimous view of farmers in Shaanxi Province. The total area of wheat in the province this year is 24 million mu. According to predictions, the total output can reach more than 4.35 billion jin, slightly lower than last year, but exceeding the bumper year of 1954. This year, many high-yield fields have appeared in various places. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, which set a new record for high wheat yields last year, has achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. According to predictions, the average yield of wheat this year is more than 420 jin per mu, which is 80 to 90 jin more than the average yield per mu last year. This cooperative has ten mu of high-yield wheat, with a yield of 1,200 jin per mu. The Xianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Heyang County has seven mu of high-yield wheat (stubble), with a predicted yield of more than 1,030 jin per mu. Other places, such as Pucheng and Chaoyi, have also seen high-yield fields. Some have yields of more than 800 jin per mu, and some have yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu.

Although the total wheat output in Shaanxi this year is lower than last year, the quality of wheat is much better than last year. Last year, the wheat germination was very serious due to the rainy season during the harvest. This year, the wheat matured well, and the harvest period coincided with good weather, so the wheat grains are full and produce more flour. According to some local experiments, this year's wheat weighs one jin more per dou than last year's wheat. Therefore, the farmers are very satisfied with this year's harvest.

This year, the wheat harvesting work of agricultural cooperatives has been smoother and more timely than in previous years, shortening the harvest time compared to previous years. For example, in Dali County, it used to take six or seven days to harvest wheat, but this year it took only three or four days. The wheat on the Xingping dryland started harvesting on the 4th of this month and was finished on the 10th, while last year's summer harvest lasted for a month. This shows that the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives in various places have made great progress in the past year.

Before the end of May, agricultural cooperatives in various places formulated pre-distribution plans, calculated them down to the households, and posted them. Most agricultural cooperatives adhered to the spirit of satisfying the state, the cooperative, and the members in the pre-distribution plan, and generally distributed 60%-70% of the total income to the members. Due to the timely formulation of the pre-distribution plan and the fair and reasonable distribution, the enthusiasm of the members was very high. Before the wheat harvest, various places generally summarized the experience of last year's summer harvest and formulated a summer harvest work plan, rationally organizing labor and animal power. In the Guanzhong cooperatives, production teams were divided into wheat harvesting, wheat transportation, and threshing groups. Experienced threshing leaders were set up on the threshing grounds to direct the wheat harvesting, wheat transportation, and threshing work. Therefore, this year's summer harvest work was carried out quickly and orderly, avoiding the phenomenon of uneven workload in the past. While harvesting wheat, agricultural cooperatives in various places paid attention to summer planting. In addition to having dedicated personnel responsible for the summer harvest, many cooperatives also organized harrowing and autumn planting groups to be responsible for summer planting, ensuring that summer harvest and summer planting were not delayed.

During the summer harvest work, various places universally strengthened political and ideological work. Staff in the wheat-producing areas of various counties went deep into the agricultural cooperatives. About 90% of county-level officials in counties such as Wugong, Xianyang, Hu County, Chang'an, Sanyuan, Weinan, and Pucheng went deep into the wheat fields to participate in labor. On the one hand, they ate, lived, and worked with the masses, and on the other hand, they carried out political and ideological work for the members. Some problems in the wheat harvest can be solved in time.

### 陕西小麦又丰收了

　　陕西小麦又丰收了
    本报讯　在陕西省的农村里，到处是一片丰收的景象。目前，这个省夏收工作已进入紧张阶段。陕南山区四百一十万亩小麦，已基本收割完毕，现在正集中进行碾麦工作。在陕西省小麦主要产地的关中平原上，共有一千六百五十七万余亩小麦，目前已收割了70％以上。陕北延安、榆林地区小麦共三百七十多万亩，成熟较晚，现在正开始收割冬小麦，估计在本月底可以全部割完。
    “今年又是一个丰收年”，这是陕西省农民一致的看法。全省今年共二千四百万亩小麦，根据预测，总产量可达到四十三亿五千万余斤，稍低于去年，但是超过丰收的1954年。今年各地又出现了不少的丰产田。去年创小麦高产新纪录的渭南县双王乡和平农业社，今年又获得全面大丰收。根据预测的结果，今年小麦平均每亩产四百二十多斤，比去年平均亩产多八、九十斤。这个社有十亩丰产小麦，亩产一千二百斤。郃阳县先进农业社的七亩高额丰产小麦（回茬），预测亩产一千零三十多斤。其它如蒲城、朝邑等地，也出现了高额丰产田。有的亩产八百余斤，有的亩产一千斤以上。
    今年陕西小麦总产量虽然低于去年，但是小麦的质量比去年好多了。去年由于收获期间遇到雨季，小麦发芽现象非常严重。今年小麦成熟的好，收获期又赶上好天气，因此麦粒饱满，出粉多。据有些地方试验，今年小麦比去年小麦每斗重一斤，因此，农民对今年的丰收感到非常满意。
    今年麦收工作各农业社都进行的比往年顺利而且及时，比往年缩短了收获的时间。例如大荔县已往收割麦子需要六、七天，而今年只用了三、四天的时间就割完了。兴平旱原上的麦子从本月4日开始收割，到10日就割完了，而去年夏收却拖了一个月的时间。这说明各地农业社一年来在经营管理上有了很大的进步。
    在5月底以前，各地农业社就制定了预分方案，核算到户，贴榜公布。大多数农业社在预分方案中，都坚持了使国家、社和社员三满意的精神，一般的都把总收入的60％——70％分给了社员。由于预分方案制订的及时，而且分配公平合理，社员的劳动积极性都很高。各地在麦收前一般都总结了去年夏收中的经验，制定了夏收工作计划，合理地组织了劳动力和畜力。关中各社生产队都分成割麦、运麦、碾场等小组，在麦场上都设有对夏收有经验的场长，指挥割麦、运麦、碾场等工作。因此，今年夏收工作进行的又迅速又有秩序，避免了已往忙闲不均的窝工现象。在夏收的同时各地农业社都注意了夏种工作。很多社除了夏收有专人负责外，各生产队还组织了拉耙组和种秋组，负责夏季播种工作，保证了夏收、夏种两不误。
    在夏收工作中，各地普遍地加强了政治思想工作。产麦区各县的工作人员都深入到各农业社里去。武功、咸阳、鄠县、长安、三原、渭南、蒲城等县，有90％左右的县级机关干部深入到麦田里参加劳动。他们一方面和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，一方面对社员展开了政治思想工作。麦收中的一些问题，都能得到及时解决。
