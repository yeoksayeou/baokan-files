Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 11th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Mu) reported: The wheat harvest in the Huai River plains of Anhui Province is bountiful, and the farmers are ecstatic. These days, as soon as the rooster crows in the morning, a rolling stream of people floods into the golden fields. Strong men vigorously wield scythes, experienced old farmers shout at the livestock transporting wheat, bustling back and forth, and the girls chat, laugh and sing. At night, under the bright moon, the fields are still filled with the joyous songs of the wheat harvesters.

This year, the wheat on the thousand-li plains along the Huai River in Anhui Province has large ears and full grains, surpassing the bumper harvest of 1955. At 18:00 on the 10th, comrades from the Fuyang Local Committee of the Communist Party of China told reporters on a long-distance call that they had just received a call from the Woyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, that the 6,000 mu of wheat in the "Three Changes and One Cooperative" exceeded the output of 1955 by 20%; of which 100 mu averaged more than 500 jin per mu, and 30 mu averaged more than 700 jin per mu. The Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Jieshou County also reported that 10 mu of wheat averaged 440 jin per mu. On the same day, Zhou Jiannong, Deputy Secretary of the Bengbu Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, excitedly told reporters: "The bumper harvest has given the farmers along the Huai River, who have suffered from disasters for six out of the past eight years, a chance to breathe! This year, the wheat yield in the disaster areas along the Huai River is generally 150 to 200 jin per mu, and the farmers here have an average of more than three mu of land per person, so this season's harvest will be enough to eat for a year."

Because the harvest is so good, farmers are afraid of the sudden floods like last year, and have launched a campaign to rush the harvest. As of the 10th, about half of the 43 million mu of wheat has been harvested. The wheat in the flood storage, flood diversion areas, and low-lying areas along the Huai River has been basically harvested. If there is no heavy rain in the next seven days, the bumper harvest of wheat can all be brought in.

Huaiyuan, June 11th (by this newspaper) The wheat in Huaiyuan County, along the Huai River in Anhui Province, is growing very well this year, and is all ripe. Striving for a bumper harvest is the most important task at present. However, the county started harvesting nearly a week ago, and the harvested area only accounts for 25% of the total summer harvest area. The progress of wheat harvesting is slow in most areas, and recent continuous rainfall poses a water hazard, making the situation very urgent. After discovering this serious situation through inspection, the Huaiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of the 10th, instructing all districts, townships, and cooperatives to immediately take measures to speed up the progress of the rush harvest.

Historically, Huaiyuan County is most vulnerable to floods and waterlogging from the Huai River in summer and autumn. Last year, it suffered water damage during the summer harvest, causing great losses to the wheat that was already in hand. However, this year, some cadres and the masses still have an insufficient understanding of this situation in the area, and the phenomenon of hesitation and waiting is very serious. During the wheat harvest, cadres and masses of many agricultural cooperatives waited for sunny and dry weather, not rushing to harvest the wheat that was within reach, and letting it suffer wind and rain again and again. In response to this situation, the Huaiyuan County Committee instructed cadres at all levels of districts, townships, and cooperatives to immediately educate the masses to overcome the idea of waiting and complacency. The flood diversion area of ​​the Huai River must be harvested regardless of rain or shine. In general areas, harvesting must be carried out as soon as the rain stops, so that the wheat in hand will not suffer any more losses. Cadres at all levels of districts, townships, and cooperatives should be responsible for different areas and teams, and complete the rush harvesting task on time.

The second problem existing in the wheat harvest in Huaiyuan County is that some township, cooperative, and team cadres have still not changed their commandist style of work, and have not truly participated in the wheat harvest themselves. A large number of female laborers in the cooperative have not been mobilized. In one cooperative with nineteen production teams, only some women in three teams participated in the wheat harvesting work. Out of the entire cooperative's 5,000 mu of wheat, only about 2,000 mu have been harvested, while many women are picking up wheat in the fields. After discovering this situation through inspection, the County Party Committee pointed out to the cadres that participating in production and leading production is their task, and they must actually participate in the wheat harvest themselves. All production teams and groups should supervise and oversee each other to ensure that all women who can participate in production are put into the wheat harvest. In particular, the family members of cadres must take the lead in harvesting wheat, and not only focus on picking up wheat for themselves. Cadres must mobilize all the masses to invest in the wheat harvest through their own actions.

The third problem discovered by the Huaiyuan County Committee is that there are still many shortcomings in some cooperatives and teams in terms of production order and labor and animal power arrangements. During the tense period of wheat harvesting, some cooperative members still go to the fields late and leave work early. On the one hand, the phenomenon of wasting labor is serious, and on the other hand, the cut wheat in the fields is only waiting for livestock to pull it, and very little is carried by manpower. The County Party Committee pointed out that if this situation is not changed, the wheat harvesting time will be prolonged, resulting in unnecessary losses. It is required that each cooperative reasonably adjust labor and animal power, and reasonably change the work point remuneration according to the actual situation, and not mechanically implement the originally stipulated work point remuneration, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of cooperative members to rush to harvest wheat and speed up the wheat harvesting speed. The Huaiyuan County Committee also instructed that cooperatives and teams should support each other. Cooperatives and teams that harvest quickly should support cooperatives and teams that harvest slowly. It is necessary to mobilize residents of market towns as much as possible to support farmers in harvesting wheat. It is also required that each cooperative pay close attention to listening to weather forecasts, and arrange the work of the cooperative every day according to changes in the weather.

Zhao Ruzeng, Secretary of the Huaiyuan County Committee, and other Party and government responsible comrades have led cadres from various county-level organs to participate in wheat harvesting for several days, setting an example. The above-mentioned problems and measures are those that they promptly proposed from participating in production.

　　淮河两岸千里平原小麦穗大籽饱
　　农民心花怒放突击抢收
　　怀远县麦收迟缓，县委提出三项措施加快收麦速度
    新华社蚌埠11日电  新华社记者林牧报道：安徽省淮河两岸小麦丰收，农民心花怒放。这几天，早晨公鸡刚叫，滚滚的人流就涌向金黄的田野，壮年男子有力地挥舞着镰刀，有经验的老农吆喝着运麦的耕畜，穿梭奔跑，姑娘们更是有说有笑又有唱。夜晚，明月当空，原野上还荡漾着收麦人的欢歌声。
    今年，安徽省淮河两岸千里平原的小麦穗大籽饱，胜过丰收的1955年。10日十八时，中共阜阳地方委员会的同志在长途电话中告诉记者说，他刚接到中共涡阳县委员会的电话，三改一社的六千亩小麦，产量超过1955年二成；其中有一百亩平均每亩收五百多斤，有三十亩平均每亩收到七百斤以上。界首县的建国农业社也报告说，有十亩小麦平均每亩收四百四十斤。同日，中共蚌埠地方委员会副书记周建农兴奋地对记者说：“丰收，使八年遭到六年灾的沿淮农民喘气了！今年沿淮灾区的小麦一般每亩有一百五十斤到两百斤，而这里的农民平均每人有三亩多地，这一季的收成就可以吃一年。”
    由于收成太好，农民怕像去年那样突然袭来水涝灾害，展开了突击抢收运动。到10日为止，四千三百万亩麦子，已抢收一半左右。沿淮蓄洪、行洪区和洼地的小麦，已基本收完。如果今后七天内不连下大雨，丰收的麦子可以全部登场。
    本报怀远11日电  安徽省沿淮河的怀远县，今年小麦长得很好，且已全部黄熟，争取丰产丰收，是当前最重要的工作。但是该县开镰收麦已近一周，收割面积只占夏收总面积的25％。大部分地区收麦进度迟缓，而近日又连日降雨，水患堪虞，情况十分紧急。中共怀远县委检查发现这一严重情况后，于10日晚召开电话会议，指示各区、乡、社立即采取措施，加快抢收进度。
    怀远县的历史情况是，夏秋最易遭受淮河洪水和内涝灾害。去年就在夏收期间遭了水害，使到手的小麦受了很大损失。但是，今年有些干部和群众对当地这一情况认识仍然不足，迟疑等待的现象十分严重。许多农业社的干部和群众在麦收期间，等待天晴地干，放着到手的小麦不抢收，而让它一次再次的遭受风刮和雨打。对于这一情况，怀远县委指示各区、乡、社干部，要立即教育群众克服等待麻痹思想，淮河行洪区要阴雨无阻地抢收，在一般地区也必须雨一停止即进行抢收，不使到手的小麦再遭受损失。各区、乡、社干部要分片分队负责，按时完成抢收任务。
    怀远县在麦收中存在的第二个问题是，有些乡、社、队干部仍然没有改变指手划脚的作风，没有真正亲自参加麦收，不少社妇女劳动力还没有发动起来。有一个社十九个生产队，只有三个队的部分妇女参加了收麦工作，全社小麦五千亩才收两千亩左右，而许多妇女却在地里拾麦。县委检查发现这一情况后，对干部指明，参加生产领导生产是他们的任务，要他们确实亲自参加收麦。各生产队、组要互相督促监督，务使能参加生产的妇女全部投入麦收。特别是干部家属，必须首先带头收麦，而不要只顾自己拾麦。干部要通过自己的行动，把所有群众发动起来投入麦收。
    怀远县委发现的第三个问题是，有些社、队在生产秩序方面和劳、畜力安排上仍有许多缺点。有的社的群众在麦收紧张期间，仍是迟上地，早下工。一方面是窝工浪费现象严重，另一方面，地里割倒的麦子又只等牲畜拉，很少用人力挑送。县委指出，这种情况不加改变，将使小麦收割时间延长，遭受不应有的损失。要求各社合理调整劳畜力，并根据实际情况合理地改变工分报酬，不要机械执行原来规定的工分报酬，以鼓舞社员抢收小麦的积极性，加快收麦速度。怀远县委还指示各社、队之间要相互支援，收得快的社、队要支援收得慢的社、队，要尽量发动集镇居民支援农民收麦。并要求各社要好好注意收听气象预报，每天根据气象变化情况，安排社的工作。
    怀远县委书记赵如曾和其他党、政负责同志以身作则，带领县里各机关干部参加收麦已有数日，上面这些问题和措施，就是他们从参加生产中及时提出的。
