　　Helping the Party Rectify: Uphold the Socialist Standpoint
　　Many Democratic Figures in Shenyang Refute Anti-Socialist Fallacies
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 9th dispatch) The recent fallacies published in newspapers, deviating from socialism, have aroused indignation among many figures from democratic parties in Shenyang.

    Che Xiangchen criticizes Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party rule over the world."

    Che Xiangchen, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) in Liaoning Province and Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, said: Some people still verbally acknowledge the leadership of the Communist Party and have raised their hands to support the Constitution, but their thinking is diametrically opposed to socialism. Che Xiangchen said: I disagree with Mr. Chu Anping's view of "Party rule over the world." Those of us over thirty have tasted the flavor of the Kuomintang's "Party rule over the world." At that time, could we have held meetings like this? Could we have spoken so frankly without any concerns like we have recently? Everyone knows that in old China, if you weren't careful with your words, you risked imprisonment. Now the Communist Party is rectifying and asking everyone to offer opinions, saying whatever they have to say, and broadly opening avenues of speech. I have never seen anything like this before. Can this be said to be a "Party rule over the world" monopolized by the Communist Party? Che Xiangchen said: I am not labeling people, but some people are taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification to deny the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Li Peilin said that some people are attempting to turn back the clock of history, and we must be vigilant.

    Li Peilin, a renowned Chinese pathologist and professor at Shenyang Medical College (member of the China Democratic League), said: Recently, I smelled a certain scent from the newspapers, and that is the scent of old things trying to revive from the dead. I feel very angry when I see these things. In this period of drastic ideological changes, some people are moving forward, some are moving backward, and some are attempting to turn back the clock of history. Here, I want to declare that I am not a Communist Party member, but I am resolutely opposed to revisionism. I hate it, and I hate it to the core. They say: The Communist Party should withdraw from schools and factories, and the Communist Party should "step down." We say: It cannot withdraw, it cannot step down. Once it withdraws, the world will be in great chaos. China has been in chaos for decades, even centuries. All of us have tasted bitterness. Fortunately, we have the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, when the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken. This is too closely related to the interests of each of us. Without the Communist Party, we intellectuals would be even more powerless to save ourselves. The bourgeoisie's democracy cannot save our people; it can only lead to the enemy taking advantage of our weaknesses and the return of a tragic life.

    Yang Mengxiong said: Everyone should distinguish between right and wrong and not let those with ulterior motives muddy the waters.

    Yang Mengxiong, Curator of the Shenyang Palace Museum (head of the preparatory group for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang branch), said: There are indeed people like this now—regardless of whether they are conscious of it or not, their hope is that the Communist Party has as many flaws as possible, and the bigger the better. Their attitude towards these flaws is one of gloating and kicking someone when they are down. It is difficult to understand the feelings of these people. As long as people offer some positive opinions, they are "untruthful," "protecting the Party," "kissing up," or "saying one thing and meaning another." When someone factually mentions the Party's achievements and shortcomings, it makes them angry and upset. It is truly unknown why? To help the Party rectify, on the one hand, we should boldly expose contradictions, because this will facilitate the resolution of contradictions. Regarding incorrect opinions and opinions with ulterior motives, everyone has the right and the responsibility to criticize them. If we can all face the truth and distinguish between right and wrong, those with ulterior motives will not be able to muddy the waters.

    Chen Xianshou said: With the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people can hold their heads high.

    Chen Xianshou, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Writing anonymous threatening letters is an extremely vile act. Legally speaking, it is intolerable by national law; emotionally speaking, it is also unconscionable. How can this approach correctly handle contradictions among the people and mobilize all positive forces to build socialism? Chen Xianshou said: When helping the Communist Party rectify, everyone should be vigilant and not allow bad elements to take the opportunity to undermine the Party's leadership, undermine the unity between the Party and non-Party figures, and undermine the country's socialist construction. Chen Xianshou expressed opposition to Chu Anping's statement of "Party rule over the world." He said: Because he is absolutely wrong. In the past, the Chinese Communist Party helped and supported the establishment and development of various democratic parties. Last year, it put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the democratic parties. Currently, it is asking non-Party figures to help with rectification. To ask 600 million people to help with rectification, could the Communist Party do this if it were not for the purpose of not seeking selfish interests? Could the Communist Party do this if it did not serve the people wholeheartedly? Isn't this a very practical reason? Who can say that today's world is just the Communist Party's "Party rule over the world"? Only those who superficially agree with the Communist Party's leadership but do not actually agree with it would say this. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, could China have today's international status? Could the Chinese people still hold their heads high? Could the lives of the people be so good? Only those who oppose the Communist Party and do not start from the interests of 600 million people would say this.

    Zhong Junlin said: The first rectification brought about a new China, and this rectification will bring about socialism faster.

    Zhong Junlin, horticulturist, Vice President of Shenyang Agricultural College, and head of the preparatory group for the Shenyang Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: There should be a standpoint when dealing with rectification, and that is the standpoint of socialism. Communist Party members hold this standpoint, and members of our democratic parties should also strive to learn in this regard. We comrades of the democratic parties have great hope for the Communist Party's rectification. We know that the Party's first rectification brought about a new China, and this rectification movement will bring us socialism faster. We have confidence in such a great cause. We democratic figures have a responsibility to help the Communist Party do a good job in rectification. However, some people are not being factual enough in their speech, making random remarks based on a one-sided understanding, and this is not serious.

### 帮助党整风要站稳社会主义立场  沈阳很多民主人士驳斥反社会主义谬论

　　帮助党整风要站稳社会主义立场
　　沈阳很多民主人士驳斥反社会主义谬论
    本报沈阳9日电  最近报纸上发表的某些人的离开社会主义的谬论，引起了沈阳市很多民主党派人士的愤慨。
    车向忱批驳储安平“党天下”的谬论。
    民进辽宁省筹委会主任、辽宁省副省长车向忱说：现在有些人口头上还承认共产党的领导，也举过手拥护宪法，但他们的思想是和社会主义背道而驰的。车向忱说：我不同意储安平先生说的“党天下”的看法。我们三十岁以上的人都尝过国民党的“党天下”的滋味，那时候，我们能像现在这样开会吗？能像我们最近这样每个人毫无顾虑地说话吗？大家都知道在旧中国，如果说话一不小心，就有入狱的危险。现在共产党整风，请大家提意见，有什么，说什么，广开言路，这样的事情我从未见过。这能说是共产党一手包办的“党天下”吗？车向忱说：我不是给人戴帽子，有些人是乘共产党整风之机，想由此否认共产党的领导。
    李佩琳说有人企图使历史开倒车，我们必须警惕。
    我国著名的病理学家、沈阳医学院教授李佩琳（民盟盟员）说：最近从报纸上闻到一种味道，这就是旧东西借尸还魂的味道。我看到这些东西，就感到很生气。在这思想剧烈变化的时期，有的人往前进，有的人往后退，还有的企图叫历史开倒车。这里我要声明，我不是共产党员，但是我是坚决反对修正主义的，我恨它，而且恨得要命。他们说：共产党要退出学校去，退出工厂去，共产党应该“下台”。我们说：退不得，下不得，一退天下就要大乱。中国乱了几十年、上百年，我们这些人都曾饱尝辛酸，亏得有了共产党。没有共产党，复巢之下就无完卵，这和我们每个人的利害关系太大了。没有共产党，我们知识分子更是无力自救的。资产阶级的民主，不能救我们的人民，它只能导致敌人乘虚而入，使悲惨的生活卷土重来。
    杨孟雄说：大家要明辨是非，不让别有用心的人混水摸鱼。
    沈阳故宫博物馆馆长杨孟雄
  （民革支部筹备负责人）说：现在确有这样的人——不管他们有意识还是无意识，他们的希望是共产党的缺点越多越好，越大越好。他们对这些缺点采取的态度是幸灾乐祸、下井投石的态度，这些人的心情是很难理解的，只要人家提些正面意见，就是“不真实”，“包庇党”，“拍马取好”，“言不由衷”，当有人实事求是提到党的成就和缺点时，也要惹得他们生气发火，大不高兴，真是不知道是为了什么？帮助党整风，一方面应该大胆地揭露矛盾，暴露矛盾，因为这样就有利于矛盾的解决。对不正确的意见，别有用心的意见，人人都有权也有责任提出批判，我们大家都能正视是非，明辨是非，别有用心的人就无法混水摸鱼了。
    陈先舟说：有了共产党领导，中国人才能扬眉吐气。
    民盟辽宁省委员会主任委员陈先舟说：写匿名信进行恐吓，这是一种极端恶劣的行为，从法律上讲，是国法所不容的，从人情上讲，也是不讲良心的。这种做法怎么能够正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动一切积极力量建设社会主义呢？陈先舟说：大家在帮助共产党整风时，要提高警惕，不要让坏分子借机破坏党的领导，破坏党与非党人士的团结，破坏国家的社会主义建设。陈先舟对储安平“党天下”的说法表示反对。他说：因为他绝对是不对的。中国共产党过去帮助扶持了各个民主党派的建立和发展，去年又提出了同民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，目前又要求党外人士帮助整风。要六亿人民帮助整风，要不是不以私利为目的共产党能这样作吗？要不是全心全意为人民服务的共产党能这样作吗？这不是很实际的道理吗？谁能说今日的天下只是共产党的“党天下”？只有表面上赞成、实质上不赞成共产党领导的人，才会这样说。如果没有共产党的领导，中国能有今天的国际地位？中国人还能扬眉吐气？老百姓的生活还能这样好？只有反对共产党，不从六亿人民利益出发的人才能这样说。
    钟俊麟说：第一次整风带来了一个新中国，这次整风将会更快带来社会主义。
    园艺学家、沈阳农学院副院长、九三学社沈阳市分社筹委会负责人钟俊麟说：对待整风是应该有立场的，这就是社会主义的立场。共产党员是这个立场，我们民主党派的成员在这方面也应该努力学习。我们民主党派的同志对于共产党的整风抱有很大的希望。我们知道党的第一次整风带来了一个新中国，这一次整风运动将会给我们更快带来社会主义。对于这样的伟大的事业，我们是有信心的。我们民主人士有责任帮助共产党搞好整风。但是，现在有些人说话还不够实事求是，凭了片面的了解，乱说一通，这是不严肃的。
