　　Seriously Study Chairman Mao's Teachings
　　Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

　　Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a document that all our people, especially industrialists and businessmen, should seriously study. In the past few years, when our industrialists and businessmen were advancing on the road of socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the rightist Zhang Naiqi, disguised as a spokesperson for the industrial and commercial circles, reversed black and white, spread fallacies, and attempted to pull us back to the reactionary road of capitalism. Chairman Mao's speech provided us with ideological weapons, sobered our minds, and enabled us to more forcefully shatter all the anti-socialist conspiracies of the rightists.

　　Zhang Naiqi denied the dual nature of industrialists and businessmen, denied the existence of exploitation, and actually wanted industrialists and businessmen to relax their transformation and not to transform themselves. Chairman Mao's speech sternly and powerfully rebuked this absurd argument, pointing out to us: On the one hand, we are in the process of transforming from exploiters into self-reliant laborers; on the other hand, we are still receiving fixed interest in joint state-private enterprises, and the roots of exploitation have not yet been removed; we still have a considerable distance from the thoughts, feelings, and living habits of the working class. It must be recognized that Chairman Mao pointed out our dual nature and pointed out that fixed interest is still exploitation, precisely to encourage us to work hard to transform ourselves and change ourselves into laborers as soon as possible; while the rightists are doing everything possible to confuse our ideological understanding, slacken self-transformation, and set traps on our road forward. Chairman Mao's instructions on the current class relations completely shattered the absurd arguments of the rightists. Chairman Mao instructed: "The large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle of the revolutionary period has basically ended, but the class struggle has not completely ended." Chairman Mao wants us to correctly recognize the existence of current class relations, precisely to enable us to change ourselves from the bourgeoisie to the working class as soon as possible; while the rightists' intention of blurring class relations is not to correctly handle class contradictions, but to sharpen the class struggle.

　　Chairman Mao pointed out to us that the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field is still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce, and in this respect, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not really ended. Chairman Mao's instruction is to enable us to better carry out ideological transformation and change the thoughts and feelings of exploiters into the thoughts and feelings of laborers, while the rightists try their best to deny the importance of ideological transformation, and even believe that the thoughts of industrialists and businessmen are more brilliant than the working class. The intention is precisely to use the negative aspects still existing in the ideology of industrialists and businessmen to oppose our approaching the masses of employees and workers, modestly learning from the working class, and transforming ourselves.

　　Chairman Mao affirmed the progress made by our industrialists and businessmen in the past few years and instructed us on the path of further transformation. Chairman Mao said: "The thorough transformation of industrialists and businessmen must be in the course of work. They should work together with employees and workers in the enterprise and take the enterprise as a base for self-transformation. But it is also important to change some of their old views through study." We industrialists and businessmen must deeply understand this earnest and well-meaning teaching, strengthen the study of theory and business, improve socialist consciousness, and not fail to live up to Chairman Mao's earnest expectations for us.

　　Chairman Mao has given us six criteria so that we can clearly distinguish the ideological and action boundaries with the rightists. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Among these six criteria, the most important are the two, the socialist road and the leadership of the Party." The conspiratorial activities of Zhang Naiqi and all rightists are to not want socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party. We industrialists and businessmen across the country must earnestly study Chairman Mao's speech, firmly remember these six criteria, especially the two concerning the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. We must resolutely take the socialist road, always follow the Communist Party, be vigilant at all times, oppose all the instigation and incitement of the rightists, and carry out a resolute struggle against the rightists.

　　认真学习毛主席的教导
　　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员  陈叔通
    毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，是我们全国人民特别是工商业者人人都应该认真学习的文件。几年来我们工商业者在中国共产党领导下正在向社会主义道路上前进的时候，右派分子章乃器伪装成为工商界的代言人，颠倒黑白，散播谬论，企图把我们拉回到反动的资本主义的道路上去。毛主席的讲演给予了我们思想武器，清醒了我们的头脑，使我们能够更有力地粉碎右派分子的一切反社会主义的阴谋诡计。
    章乃器否认工商业者的两面性，否认还有剥削的存在，实际上要工商业者放松改造，不要改造。毛主席的演讲严肃地有力地申斥了这种荒谬言论，向我们指出：我们一方面正处在由剥削者变为自食其力的劳动者的转变过程中，另一方面，我们还在公私合营企业中拿定息，剥削的根子还没有脱离；我们同工人阶级的思想感情、生活习惯还有一个不少的距离。必须认识，毛主席指出我们的两面性，指出定息还是剥削，正是为了鼓励我们努力自我改造，早些把自己改变为劳动者；而右派分子却是千方百计地迷惑我们的思想认识，松懈自我改造，在我们的前进道路上设下了陷阱。毛主席对于目前阶级关系的指示，完全粉碎了右派分子的荒谬言论。毛主席指示说：“现在的情况是：革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本结束，但是阶级斗争还没有完全结束”。毛主席要我们正确认识目前阶级关系的存在，正是为了要我们尽早地把自己由资产阶级改变为工人阶级；而右派分子模糊阶级关系的用意，不是为了正确地处理阶级矛盾，而是要使阶级斗争尖锐化起来。
    毛主席向我们指出，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争还是长期的、曲折的、有时甚至是很激烈的，在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间的谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正结束。毛主席的这个指示是要我们更好地进行思想改造，改变剥削者的思想感情为劳动者的思想感情，而右派分子竭力否认思想改造的重要性，甚至认为工商业者的思想比工人阶级还高明，用意所在，正是为了利用工商业者在思想上还存在的消极一面，反对我们靠拢职工群众，向工人阶级虚心学习，改造自己。
    毛主席肯定了我们工商业者几年来的进步，指示我们进一步改造的路径。毛主席说：“工商业者的彻底改造必须是在工作中间，他们应当在企业内同职工一起劳动，把企业作为自我改造的基地。但是经过学习改变自己的某些旧观点，也是重要的。”我们工商业者必须深刻体会这种谆谆善诱，语重心长的教导，加强理论、业务的学习，提高社会主义觉悟，不要辜负毛主席对我们的殷切期望。
    毛主席给我们指示了六条标准，使我们能够很好地和右派分子划清思想上和行动上的界限。毛主席指示我们说：“这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”章乃器和一切右派分子的阴谋活动，就是不要社会主义，反对党的领导。我们全国工商业者，必须认真地学习毛主席的讲演，牢牢记住这六条标准，特别是关于社会主义道路和党的领导两条。我们要坚决走社会主义的道路，永远跟共产党走，随时随刻提高警惕，反对一切右派分子的挑拨、煽动，并对右派分子进行坚决的斗争。
