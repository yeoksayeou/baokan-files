    "Valuing Mutual Understanding"
　　Fán Bīng
    Some right-wing elements, in ordinary times when discussing national policies, would rush to applaud and raise their hands, shouting countless "Long lives!" for the Communist Party, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship. Now, taking advantage of the Party rectification campaign, they clamor for the abolition of the Party's leadership, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship and socialism, and even declare that they want to spread this "truth" to the grassroots and to the workers and peasants. They can't even wait "half a year," and can't wait to demand that the Communist Party "step down" and immediately be "replaced." What does this show? Originally, what is being revealed now is the "true heart" of these people, while what was shown in the past was entirely their "false intentions."
    "In relationships, the most valuable thing is understanding each other's hearts." Now the Party and the people of the whole country know the "hearts" of the right-wing elements, and this is one of the great gains of this rectification campaign.

    “贵相知心”
　　凡兵
    有些右派分子，平时讨论国家方针政策，争先鼓掌、举手，对于共产党、社会主义和人民民主专政，不知喊了多少个“万岁”；现在则乘党整风之机，叫嚣取消党的领导，反对人民民主专政和社会主义，还声言要把这个“真理”散布到基层和工农群众中去，甚至连“半岁”也等不及了，恨不能立即要共产党“下台”，立即“取而代之”。这说明什么？原来，现在表现出来的，才是这些人们的“真心”，而过去所表现的，完全是他们的“假意”。
    “人之相知，贵相知心。”现在党和全国人民知道了右派分子的“心”，这也就是这次整风的巨大收获之一。
