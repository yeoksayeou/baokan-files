Xinhua News Agency, Qilian, June 24th: The vast number of geological exploration workers active on the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains are actively carrying out activities to increase production and practice thrift in extremely difficult environments.

The employees of the control survey team of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, under the circumstances that the state's investment has been reduced again and again while the tasks have been added again and again, not only did not reduce their confidence in completing the task, but also came up with many ways to increase production and practice thrift in light of local conditions. In order to save materials and freight, they mostly chose the highest mountain tops for their selection points, because this way they could make the triangular markers smaller. If stone and wooden markers were transported from afar, the freight would be very high, so they tried to obtain materials and manufacture them locally; using wood from nearby areas to make wooden markers, and making stone markers by the river at the foot of the mountain, which saved time and freight. When manpower was insufficient, the employees in the team started working together regardless of their job responsibilities. Yu Shuhua, a female comrade in charge of leveling work, also came to help smash rocks to make stone markers, and did not complain even when the rocks cut her face. This saved a lot of money.

The employees of the Baijingsi Geological Team of the Ministry of Geology also put forward many ways to increase production and practice thrift. The workers who were prospecting in the sparsely populated Yegou used iron spoons to scoop soil for trenching. Iron spoons were expensive and easily damaged, so worker Ma Jincai used tree branches from the local mountains in his spare time to weave baskets to replace iron spoons, which saved money and was easy to use. The employees of this team also repaired and used the old hoes in stock, and used broken felt to make cattle saddles, which also saved a lot of money.

　　投资一减再减　任务一加再加
    祁连山地质勘探职工出色地完成任务
    据新华社祁连24日电　活跃在祁连山南麓的广大地质勘探职工，在极端艰苦的环境里，积极开展增产节约活动。
    煤炭工业部西北煤田地质勘探局控制测量队的职工们，在国家的投资一减再减而任务一加再加的情况下，不但没有降低完成任务的信心，而且还因地制宜地想了很多增产节约的办法。他们为了节约材料和运费，选点多半选在最高的山头上，因为这样就可以把三角标造的小些。石标和木标要是从远处运来，运费很多，他们就设法就地取材、就地制造；利用附近地区的木材造木标，在山脚下的河旁造石标，既节省时间又免去运费。人力不够，队里的职工不分工种地一齐动手。于淑华是个负责水准工作的女同志，也来帮助砸石头造石标，石头划破了她的脸皮，也不叫苦。这样就省下了很多钱。
    地质部百经寺地质队的职工们，也同样提出了许多增产节约的办法。在人烟稀少的野牛沟里进行勘探的工人们，原来进行槽探是用铁勺提土，铁勺价贵而且容易损坏，工人马进财就在余暇时间用当地山上的树条编成筐子，代替铁勺，又省钱又好用。这个队的职工还把库存的旧镐加以修理使用，利用破毡做牛鞍，也省下不少钱。
