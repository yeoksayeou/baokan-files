Bringing New Weapons into South Korea is a Criminal Act
North Korean Public Opinion Condemns the US for Playing with Fire Again

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - North Korean democratic parties and trade union organizations condemned the US for moving the "United Nations Command" in Tokyo to Seoul.

Li Guangguk, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party of North Korea, said: The US's attempt to move the "United Nations Command" to South Korea is an attempt to strengthen its military occupation of South Korea. This plot by American warmongers is directly related to its sinister policy of expanding military bases, deploying atomic-equipped troops, artificially creating tension, and preparing for a new war around the world. All members of the Democratic Party and all patriotic Korean people can never tolerate this act of playing with fire by the United States.

Kang Yang-mo, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, said: The Korean working class and all Korean people will never tolerate this criminal conspiracy of the US imperialists aimed at increasingly strengthening their policy of aggression against Korea. The power of the Korean people united will surely crush all the aggressive plots of the US imperialists, force the US military to withdraw from Korea, and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today saying that the US side completely exposed yesterday at the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting its long-planned conspiracy to bring new types of weapons into South Korea and turn South Korea into an atomic war base.

The editorial said that to maintain peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, all foreign troops must simultaneously and rapidly withdraw from Korea, the Korean Armistice Agreement must be observed, and it must be transformed into a solid peace.

"Democratic Korea" also published an editorial today saying that if the American warmongers disregard all the efforts made by the Korean people for peace and vainly attempt to realize its sinister conspiracy, it must be responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. The editorial pointed out that the aggressor's conspiracy is bound to fail, the Korean people's just struggle is bound to win, and the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜民主党派和工会组织谴责美国把在东京的“联合国军司令部”迁到汉城。
    北朝鲜民主党中央委员会副委员长李光国说：美国要把“联合国军司令部”迁到南朝鲜是企图加强对南朝鲜的军事占领。美国好战分子的这种策划是同它在世界各处扩充军事基地、调驻原子装备部队、人工制造紧张局势、准备新战争的凶险政策直接相关的，民主党的全体党员同爱国的全体朝鲜人民绝不能容忍美国的这个玩火行径。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长姜?模说：朝鲜工人阶级和全体朝鲜人民绝不能容忍美帝国主义者的这个旨在日益加强对朝鲜侵略政策的罪恶阴谋。朝鲜人民团结起来的力量必定能粉碎美帝国主义者的一切侵略阴谋，并且使美军撤出朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一。
    据新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，美方昨天在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上完全暴露了它好久以来所策划的把新型武器运入南朝鲜、把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地的阴谋。
    社论说，要维护朝鲜和平与和平解决朝鲜问题，必须使一切外国军队同时迅速地退出朝鲜，遵守朝鲜停战协定，并且把它转变为巩固的和平。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天也发表社论说，如果美国好战分子不顾朝鲜人民为和平所作的一切努力，妄想实现它的险恶阴谋，它就要对因此而产生的后果负责。社论指出，侵略者的阴谋一定失败，朝鲜人民的正义斗争一定会获得胜利，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决。
