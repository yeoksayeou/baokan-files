　　Recalling Thought Reform from the Rectification Campaign
　　Luo Ergang
    The Communist Party's rectification movement has unfolded. My personal experience is that this movement, from the Communist Party's perspective, is to eliminate the "three evils." From the perspective of non-Party members, it is a movement to raise awareness and improve thinking.
    Turning through records from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, there has never been a ruling party that asks the people for their opinions. The Communist Party's launching and encouragement of the people to offer opinions to help itself rectify its style and eliminate the "three evils" is an unprecedented innovation in human political life. The Communist Party's launching of this movement shows that the Communist Party's regime is as solid as a rock. The Communist Party's humility, seeking of collective wisdom, and listening to the people's opinions demonstrate that the politics led by the Communist Party is precisely the people's democracy we are pursuing. And the people immediately responded to the Party's call, knowing everything and saying everything, which also shows the people's enthusiastic support for the Communist Party and represents the great unity between the Communist Party and the people.
    The opinions on eliminating the "three evils" put forward by the broad masses of the people, whether they are correct or deviate from the facts, are helpful to the Communist Party's rectification campaign if mistakes are corrected and if there are none, then be encouraged, and therefore can be said to be good. However, there are also a very small number of individual opinions that go beyond the scope of eliminating the "three evils" and touch upon basic issues of understanding. I think this is related to the issue of thought reform for our intellectuals. Therefore, I would like to recall my thought reform from my personal examination today.
    We intellectuals who are over fifty years old grew up in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China and were deeply influenced by the ideological morality of feudalism and the ideological morality of capitalism. If we do not undergo thought reform after liberation, or do not sincerely accept the reform, then it is certain that we will feel incompatible everywhere and full of contradictions in today's new socialist society. However, if in the process of thought reform, we recognize our past mistakes and shift to the people's standpoint, then we will definitely gradually accept new ideas and new morals, thereby achieving seamless integration with everything in the new society.
    Taking myself as an example, the first issue is the issue of objectivism, which is actually the issue of standpoint. I was deeply poisoned by objectivism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when writing history, I treated the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and Zeng Guofan equally. When looking at politics, I treated the Communist Party and the Kuomintang equally. I did not believe the Kuomintang's propaganda that the Communist Party was not resisting Japan, because the first great victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Pingxingguan Victory, was fought by the Eighth Route Army; I also doubted the Communist Party's claim that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army resisted 64% of the invading Japanese army and 95% of the puppet troops, thinking that the Communist Party's words should be discounted. I thought I was above politics and above class, I thought I was "objective," and I thought that this was the only way to see the truth of the facts without bias. After liberation, I was educated by the Communist Party and first understood that no one in the world can be above politics and above class, and that there is no such thing as "objectivism" at all. As a historical researcher, I examined the historians of feudal society and capitalist society, and I learned that Dong Hu, who was called a good historian by Confucius, was willing to have his head cut off rather than change his condemnation of Zhao Dun for assassinating the monarch, because he wanted to maintain the feudal ethics of the relationship between the monarch and his ministers and serve the feudal rulers. I also learned that bourgeois historians emphasize objectivism in order to cover up class struggle, prevent the working people from making revolution, and thereby maintain the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie, and they are also serving their own class. It can be seen that historians from ancient times to the present have all served their class without exception. History is a science of class struggle, and there is no such thing as "objectivism." I then examined my own works. In my works on the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, I loved the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but in "New Records of the Xiang Army," I developed feelings for Zeng Guofan. This raised the issue of right and wrong. I asked myself: Which is "right," the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom or Zeng Guofan? If the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is "right," then Zeng Guofan's opposition to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is "wrong." Following the issue of right and wrong is the issue of distinguishing between enemies and friends. Since Zeng Guofan opposed the people's revolution, he is my enemy, and I must hate him. Thus, from clarifying right and wrong, distinguishing between enemies and friends, I finally solved the issue of standpoint, allowing me to completely eradicate the poison of objectivism and firmly stand on the people's standpoint. My standpoint issue was resolved through the education of great principles and through the examination of my own studies and work. I gradually developed new feelings and new views on politics, research, and everything. The ancients said: "My way is consistent." After the standpoint issue was resolved, I truly had this kind of experience.
    The second issue is the issue of so-called "freedom." I was deeply influenced by Zhuangzi's thought in my youth, and I developed a nihilistic outlook on life that transcended external things. The work I did was in epigraphy and archaeology, and I spent all day in a small room, living what I thought was a "free" small world. After liberation, everyone had to belong to an organization and live an organized and disciplined life. The organization managed me, and I was busy attending meetings, listening to reports, and participating in discussions all year round, as well as participating in politics, being a representative, and serving as a committee member. This caused great conflict with my so-called "freedom." Needless to say, I was in great pain at first. However, I asked myself: Is my kind of "freedom" right? I had heard since I was a child that the 400 million compatriots of China were a heap of loose sand. Everyone was angry that the imperialists invaded and even wanted to destroy the country because of the loose sand. Why were the 400 million compatriots a heap of loose sand? It was because there was no organization. Now the Communist Party has organized the 600 million compatriots of the country, and the 600 million compatriots are of one mind, overthrowing the dark rule and driving away the imperialists. China has stood up because there is organization. My so-called "freedom" in the past was "freedom" with my eyes closed and my ears plugged, "freedom" to be a slave to a foreign country at any time. Today, we are advancing towards the goals of socialist construction, communist construction, and even the great harmony of the world. This is true freedom. Therefore, today, as the people of the People's Republic of China, we must obey the organization. After such understanding in my thinking, I used great restraint in action to change the living habits of detachment from the masses and detachment from society that I had developed from childhood to old age, and gladly obeyed the organization, relied on the organization, and lived a new life.
    The third issue is the issue of the Party's leadership. I was educated by the Analects' "A gentleman does not form a party." I read many records of party struggles in Chinese history, so in the past, my view of political parties was that all parties must be biased. However, after the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party's prestige in China rose day by day, and soon it liberated China and drove away the imperialists who had oppressed China for a century. The facts brightened my eyes and reversed my prejudice. We know that since the Opium War, China's advanced people have all done the cause of saving China, but the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, as a peasant revolution, failed, the Hundred Days' Reform, as a feudal reformism, also failed, and the Xinhai Revolution, as a bourgeois revolution, failed again. The iron facts show that only the Communist Party can save China. Today, the Communist Party has completed the great cause of saving China and is moving towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. China must be led by the Communist Party. This is the Communist Party's unshirkable responsibility, and it is what the people want. This is the foundation of the country and must not be shaken. As for whether the Communist Party can lead the work in an educational institution or a scientific institution, my answer is: The Communist Party can lead and must lead. Let me use the small work I am responsible for to illustrate. In 1950, Nanjing City established a preparatory committee for the Centennial Anniversary Exhibition of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising. In 1951, the exhibition ended and was reorganized into the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Historical Materials Compilation Committee. Both of these committees were led by the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. For six years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the initial launch of exhibitions in various places educated the masses, thereby relying on the masses. In the two or three decades before liberation, even if you wore out your iron shoes, you could not find a few cultural relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Today, the cultural relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that have been discovered are already in the hundreds and thousands; Before liberation, only four or five hundred kinds of materials related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were seen, but as of last October, more than 20,000 volumes had been collected. This is entirely the achievement of the Communist Party's leadership. The small can be seen from the large. My small work is like this, and other educational, cultural, and scientific work can be known.
    Recalling my own thought reform, I often think that if I, such a stubborn old intellectual, had not undergone reform, not only would I not be able to work today, but I simply do not know what I would have become. Thought reform is painful. First, we must recognize the truth, distinguish right from wrong, and at the same time, we must look at the rapidly advancing real society. For intellectuals, in particular, we must examine and understand our own work with humility and seriousness. Once the thinking is suddenly clear, it is truly joyful from suffering, and we become a new person and change to a new life.
    Chinese intellectuals have a long historical tradition of loving the motherland and loving the truth. Many of the older generation of intellectuals have read the scriptures of ancient philosophers, and they have learned virtues such as reflection, self-restraint, humility, and simplicity. For accepting new ideas, older intellectuals are slower than younger people, but once they recognize the truth and put it into practice, they will not lag behind younger people, because they have cultivated some virtues in the past. Today, in the new society, under the education of Marxism-Leninism, the personal morality of self-cultivation in the past has been greatly raised to the new morality of collectivism, and it will exert great power. Today, in the Communist Party's rectification movement, on the one hand, we are helping the Communist Party to rectify its style, and at the same time, it is a great time for our older generation of intellectuals to improve their understanding and thinking once again after the thought reform in 1952.

　　从整风回忆思想改造
　　罗尔纲
    共产党整风运动展开了。我个人体会，这一个运动，在共产党说来是除“三害”。在党外人士说来，是一次提高认识、提高思想的运动。
    翻遍古今中外的记载，从来没有一个执政党要人民提意见的。共产党发动鼓励人民提意见，帮助自己整风，清除“三害”，这是人类政治生活上的空前创举。共产党发动这一个运动，表示共产党的政权磐石一样的巩固。共产党虚怀若谷，集思广益，倾听人民的意见，说明共产党领导的政治，正是我们所追求的人民民主。而人民也立刻响应党的号召，知无不言，言无不尽，这又表现人民对共产党的热烈拥戴，表示共产党与人民的大团结。
    在广大人民提出的除“三害”的意见，不论是对的，或者是与事实有出入的，有则改之，无则加勉，对共产党的整风都是有帮助的，因而可以说都是好的。但是，也有极少数的个别的意见，轶出了除“三害”的范围，而接触到了基本认识的问题。我认为这是有关我们知识分子的思想改造问题。因此，我今天想从我个人的检查，回忆一下我的思想改造。
    我们过了五十岁的知识分子，生长在半封建半殖民地的中国，深受了封建主义的思想道德与资本主义的思想道德的教育。如果解放后不经过思想改造，或者对改造没有诚心诚意地接受，那就肯定地到了今天社会主义的新社会来是处处感到格格不相入，处处感到矛盾重重的。但是，如果在思想改造当中，认识前非，转变到人民的立场来，那却肯定地会逐渐地接受新思想新道德，从而对新社会的一切得到融洽无间。
    拿我自己来说，首先是一个客观主义问题，实际就是立场的问题。我是深中客观主义的毒的。在抗日战争期间，写历史，把太平天国与曾国藩同等看待。看政治，把共产党与国民党同等看待。国民党宣传共产党不抗战，我不相信，因为抗战第一场大胜利平型关大捷就是八路军打的；共产党说国民党不抗战，说八路军和新四军抗击侵华日军的64％及伪军的95％，我也怀疑，认为共产党的话要打折扣。我自以为是超政治超阶级，我自以为是“客观”，我自以为这样才能够不偏不倚看出事实的真相。到解放后，我受了共产党的教育，先懂得了世界上任何人都不可能超政治超阶级，根本没有“客观主义”这一个东西存在。我是一个做历史研究的工作者，我又从封建社会的历史家和资本主义社会的历史家方面去检查，我了解到那个被孔子称为良史的董狐，他之所以头可断，而绝不肯改动他对赵盾弑君的笔诛，原来是要维护封建的君臣纲纪，替封建统治服务。我也了解到资产阶级的历史家，他们之所以极力标榜客观主义，目的是要遮掩阶级斗争，使劳动人民不去革命，借以维护资产阶级的反动统治，他们也都是为他们自己的阶级服务。可见古今来的历史家都无例外地在为他们的阶级服务。历史乃是一种阶级斗争的科学，绝无所谓“客观主义”这一个东西存在。我再检查我的著作，我在太平天国史的著作中，热爱太平天国，但我在“湘军新志”里面却对曾国藩发生了感情，这样我就提出了是非问题。我问我自己：究竟是太平天国“是”呢还是曾国藩“是”呢？如果太平天国“是”，则曾国藩对抗太平天国便“非”了。接着是非问题，就是划分敌我，曾国藩既然是对抗人民革命，他就是我的敌人，我就必须痛恨他。于是从搅清是非，划分敌我，最后就解决了立场的问题，使我连根挖掉客观主义的毒害，而紧紧地站到人民的立场上来。我的立场问题，通过大道理的教育，通过自己的所学所做的工作的检查，我得到解决了，我对政治，对研究，以至一切事物都逐渐地发生了新的感情，新的看法。古人说过：“吾道一以贯之”，我在立场问题解决之后，确有这一种体会。
    第二个问题是所谓“自由”问题。我年青时深受庄子思想的影响，养成一种超脱于物外的虚无的人生观，做的工作又是金石考古工作，整天伏处斗室过着自以为是“自由”的小天地的生活。到解放后，每一个人都要隶属于一个组织，要过有组织有纪律的生活，组织管了我，长年在忙着去开会、听报告、讨论，还要参加政治、做代表、当委员。这就给我所谓“自由”以极大的矛盾。我初时不待说是极大的痛苦的。但是，我自己问自己：我那一种“自由”对不对呢？我从儿时就听说中国四万万同胞是一盘散沙，大家都气愤由于一盘散沙才给帝国主义侵略，甚至要亡国。四万万同胞为什么是一盘散沙呢？就是因为没有组织。现在共产党把全国六万万同胞组织起来，六万万同胞成了一条心，打倒了黑暗的统治，赶走了帝国主义，中国站起来了，这就因为有了组织。我从前所谓“自由”，是掩着眼睛不看，塞着耳朵不听的“自由”，是随时有做亡国奴的“自由”。今天，我们正朝着社会主义建设、共产主义建设以至全世界大同的目标前进，这才是真自由。因此，今天作为中华人民共和国的人民，就必须服从组织。我在思想上经过这样的认识，在行动上用了极大的克制力去改变我从幼年以至老年养成了的脱离群众脱离社会的生活习惯，欣然服从组织，依靠组织，过着新的生活。
    第三个问题是党的领导问题。我是受过论语“君子不党”的教育的，我在中国历史上又读了许多党争的记载，所以从前我对政党的看法，一律都认为党就一定有偏倚。但是，到抗战以后，共产党在中国的威信一天天地高起来了，不久，解放了中国，赶走了百年来压迫中国的帝国主义。事实擦亮了我的眼睛，扭转了我的偏见。我们知道，自从鸦片战争以来，中国先进的人们，都曾经做过救中国的事业，但是，作为农民革命的太平天国失败了，作为封建改良主义的戊戌维新也失败了，作为资产阶级革命的辛亥革命又失败了，铁的事实说明，只有共产党能够救中国，今天共产党已经完成了救中国的大业，正在向富强康乐的社会主义的社会迈进，中国必须要共产党领导，这在共产党是责无旁贷，在人民是众望所归。这是国本所在，断不容动摇的。至于在一个教育机关里面，或一个科学机关里面，共产党能不能领导工作呢？我的回答是：共产党能够领导，而且必须要共产党领导。让我把我所负责的那一个小小的工作来说明。1950年南京市成立一个太平天国起义百年纪念展览筹备会，1951年展览结束，改组为太平天国史料编纂委员会。这两个会都是由中国共产党南京市委员会领导的。六年以来，由于共产党的正确领导，最初发动各地的展览，教育了群众，从而依靠群众，在解放前二三十年踏破铁鞋还发现不到几件太平天国的文物，今天发现的太平天国文物已经是数以千百计；在解放前看到与太平天国有关的资料不过四五百种，而截到去年十月止，已经收集到二万多册。这就完全是共产党的领导的成绩。即小可以见大，我这一个小小的工作如此，其他教育、文化、科学的工作都可知。
    从我自己的思想改造回忆起来，我常常想到，我这样顽固的旧知识分子，如果不经过改造，今天不仅是不能工作，简直是不知会变成什么东西。思想改造是痛苦的，首先是要认清道理，辨明是非，同时要看天天在突飞猛进的现实社会，而在知识分子说来，尤其是要在自己的业务中，虚心地认真地去作检查和认识，到了一旦思想豁然贯通的时候，那真是乐从苦中来，变了一个新人，换了一种新生活。
    中国知识分子爱祖国、爱真理，是有悠久的历史传统的。而年老一代的知识分子，有不少人曾经熟读古代哲人的经传，他们学习有反省、克己、谦让、质朴等等美德。对于接受新思想来说，老年知识分子是比年青人迟慢一些的，但到他们一旦认识真理，身体力行起来，并不会比年青人落后，就因为他们过去修养有一些美德，今天到新社会来，把过去独善其身的个人道德，在马列主义的教育之下，大大地提高到集体主义的新道德上去，就会发挥巨大的力量。今天在共产党整风运动中，一方面是帮助共产党整风，同时又正是我们年老一代的知识分子在经过1952年思想改造之后，又一次提高认识、提高思想的大好良辰。
