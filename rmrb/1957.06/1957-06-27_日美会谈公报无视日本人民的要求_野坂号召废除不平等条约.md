Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 26th: Japanese Communist Party First Secretary Sanzo Nosaka delivered a speech on June 25th, criticizing the joint communiqué from the talks between Nobusuke Kishi and Dwight Eisenhower for completely disregarding the urgent demands of the Japanese people, such as the cancellation of unequal Japan-U.S. treaties, the return of Okinawa, and the expansion of Japan-China trade.

Sanzo Nosaka told an audience of 1,500 people at a Japanese Communist Party rally in Tokyo commemorating the fifth anniversary of the revival of the JCP's newspaper, "Akahata," that the "new relationship" which Nobusuke Kishi sought to establish with the United States by visiting was one that was leading Japan into a relationship of subservience to the United States. This "new relationship" would block Japan's path towards independence and autonomy and bring unforeseen misfortunes to the Japanese people.

Nosaka called on the Japanese people to fight for Japan's independence. To achieve independence, the first step is to fight for the abolition of all unequal treaties.

　　日美会谈公报无视日本人民的要求
    野坂号召废除不平等条约
    据新华社26日讯  东京消息：日本共产党第一书记野坂参三6月25日发表演说，指责岸信介和艾森豪威尔的会谈公报完全忽视了日本人民的撤销日美不平等条约、收回冲绳、扩大日中贸易等迫切要求。
    野坂参三在日本共产党在东京举行的纪念日共机关报“赤旗报”复刊五周年大会上对一千五百名群众说，岸信介访问美国所要建立的日美“新关系”是把日本导向隶属于美国的关系。这种“新关系”将堵塞住日本走向独立自主的大门，并且将给日本人民带来不可预测的不幸。
    野坂号召日本人民为争取日本独立而斗争。为了争取独立，首先要为撤销一切不平等条约而斗争。
