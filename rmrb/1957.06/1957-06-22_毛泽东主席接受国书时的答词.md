The close cooperation between China and Korea in the political, economic, and cultural fields has already brought great practical benefits to the peoples of both countries. The Chinese people will continue to strengthen their friendly relations with the Korean people and continue to support the Korean people's cause of peaceful reunification of their country.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong concluded by saying: Ambassador, I warmly welcome you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's
