To the Editor:

    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, I have seen in the newspapers that people from various democratic parties have made many criticisms and suggestions regarding the shortcomings in the work of Party organizations at all levels and individual Party members with poor work styles. Many of these opinions are correct and valuable; however, there are also some important figures in high positions who do not calmly and realistically help the Party improve its work when offering suggestions to the leading Party, but rather proceed from personal prejudices with the attitude of venting their anger, which is not very good.
    I am a non-Party general staff member, and now I only offer some opinions on Mr. Chu Anping's speech at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department.
    I believe that Mr. Chu Anping, as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, is certainly a senior intellectual and should understand etiquette. It is of course permissible for him to offer suggestions to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and the Party Central Committee to improve the shortcomings in the leadership work of the Party Central Committee, but he should not joke about it. I think this is a desire to show off.
    In addition, Mr. Chu mentioned in his speech that throughout the country, in units large and small, even a section or a team must arrange for a Party member to be the head, and everything, no matter how trivial, must be done by watching the Party member's expression. This statement does not accord with the actual situation. According to what I know of some units, it is not as Mr. Chu said. Taking my unit, the Beijing Enamel Factory, as an example, there are a total of seven departments, and only the personnel department has a Party member as the head. The other six departments do not have Party member heads. Even the Cultural and Stationery Industrial Company, which leads our factory, has several departments headed by non-Party members. Can it be said that every section and team must have a Party member as the head? Perhaps Mr. Chu had a few more drinks before the meeting and was a little dizzy; otherwise, how could he express opinions that do not accord with the facts with such an unserious attitude?

### 储安平的发言不符合事实

    储安平的发言不符合事实编辑同志：
    自党中央提出百家争鸣、百花齐放以来，从报纸上看到各民主党派人士对各级党组织工作中的缺点和个别作风不好的党员提出了许多批评和意见。很多意见是正确的，是宝贵的；但也有一些身居显职的重要人物，对领导党提意见不是那么平心静气、实事求是地为帮助党改进工作，而是以私人成见抱出气的态度出发的，这样是不很好的。
    我是一个非党的一般的职员，现在我只对储安平先生在统战部召开的座谈会上的发言，提些意见。
    我认为作为光明日报总编辑的储安平先生，当然是个高级知识分子，应当懂得礼貌。他对毛主席和周总理、对党中央提意见，以改进党中央领导工作中的缺点，当然是可以的，但不应当开玩笑。我认为他这是风头思想。
    另外储先生在发言中提到，在全国范围内不论大小单位，甚至一个科、一个组都要安排一个党员作头儿，事无细巨都要看党员的眼色行事。这种说法是不符合实际情况的。据我知道的一些单位，就不像储先生所说的那样。以我所在的单位——北京珐琅厂来说，共有七个科室，只有人事科是个党员作头儿，其他六个科都没有党员的头儿，就连领导我厂的专业公司文化用品工业公司也有几个科是非党人士作头儿，这能说是一个科一个组都要党员作头儿吗？也许是储先生会前多喝了几杯酒，精神有些恍惚，不然怎能以这种不严肃的态度发表不符合事实的意见呢。
