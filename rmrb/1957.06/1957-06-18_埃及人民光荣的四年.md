　　The Glorious Four Years of the Egyptian People
    The Republic of Egypt has been established for four years. These are four glorious years for the Egyptian people. In these four years, the Egyptian people have demonstrated an unyielding and strong will in their struggle to safeguard their national freedom and independence. They have not only defended the independence and sovereignty of their country, but also opened up a path to independence for the Middle Eastern Arab nations who have suffered from colonial oppression for generations. As the Egyptian people celebrate their great festival, the Chinese people extend warm congratulations and the greatest respect to them.
    Four years ago, after expelling King Farouk, who represented foreign colonial interests and domestic feudal forces, the Egyptian people announced the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of an independent republic. Since then, Egypt has stood up like a giant. Under the leadership of the Republic government headed by President Nasser, the Egyptian people have strived to unite all Arab countries, pursued a positive policy of peace and neutrality, and made outstanding contributions to the noble cause of defending peace and opposing Western colonial oppression. In order to completely shake off colonial shackles and further seek economic independence and development, the Egyptian people recovered the Suez Canal Company, which had long been occupied by colonialists, abolished the British military base in the Canal Zone, and transferred foreign oil companies, banks, and insurance companies on Egyptian soil to Egyptian ownership or management. At the same time, the Egyptian people have also made good progress in implementing land system reforms, building their own national industries, and developing water resources. The Egyptian people's heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and the great achievements they have made, have promoted the vigorous development of the Middle Eastern Arab national liberation movement, have enabled the long-suffering Egyptian people and other Arab people to hold their heads high, and have made all colonialists who are invading the Middle East tremble with fear!
    Of course, Egypt's road to independence is not smooth. The Egyptian people have waged a heroic struggle against Western colonialists for nearly a century in order to win independence and freedom. Precisely because the Egyptian people have been tested for a long time and know that their independence has not come easily, they demonstrated a heroic fighting spirit and great patriotism in the war last year to repel the Anglo-French and Israeli aggressors from seizing the Suez Canal. After the end of the war, the Egyptian people showed great courage and perseverance in overcoming the economic difficulties brought about by the Anglo-French war of aggression, restoring navigation in the Suez Canal, and combating the political conspiracies and various pressures of the colonial countries to continue seizing the Suez Canal. In the face of this heroic and unyielding fighting spirit of the Egyptian people, the arrogant Western colonialists had to bow their heads, were forced to recognize Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, and paid tolls to the Egyptian Canal Company according to Egyptian conditions, and resumed using the canal.
    However, the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard independence is not over. Although the aggression of the old colonial powers, Britain and France, has been repelled, the new colonial power, the United States, is extending its aggressive forces into the Middle East. As President Nasser recently told the editor of the American magazine "Look," the difference between Britain and France and the United States is that one wants to eliminate us with bombs, while the United States wants to achieve its goals through "peaceful means"—economic pressure and starvation. Now, in order to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and control the entire Middle East, the United States is stepping up its offensive against the nationalist forces in Arab countries. The United States overthrew the nationalist government of Jordan, conspired to further undermine the four-nation alliance between Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, and instigated the organization of a pro-American so-called "Eastern Arab League," in an attempt to split the national unity between Arab countries, isolate Egypt and Syria, and achieve its aggressive goal of using Arabs to fight Arabs and divide and rule. In addition to continuing to exert economic pressure on Egypt, the United States also incites Israel to carry out war provocations against Egypt and attempts to create chaos and unrest within Egypt and Syria. This shows that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Egyptian people and the Middle Eastern Arab nations today.
    Recently, the United States has actively promoted the aggressive policy of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, participated in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact Group, co-opted a few upper-class figures in some Arab countries, and blatantly opposed Arab nationalism. Its activities are very rampant. However, precisely because of these aggressive activities, the colonial face of American imperialism has been more clearly exposed to the people of Arab countries. We believe that the destiny of the people of Arab countries is determined by the broad masses of the people of Arab countries themselves. The people of Arab countries, like the Egyptian people, have now awakened or are becoming increasingly awakened. Their movement to win the independence and liberation of their countries cannot be stopped by any aggressive forces. As long as the Middle Eastern Arab countries continue to strengthen unity and resolutely fight against Western colonialism, especially American imperialism, the United States will eventually suffer a more disastrous defeat in the Middle East than Britain and France.
    The cause of the Egyptian people to win independence and liberation is a just cause. The road taken by the Egyptian people in the struggle for national independence is the correct road for all Arab people. The Egyptian people will continue to receive the support of the people of all Arab countries and the righteous people of the world. The Chinese people have a very good friendship with the Egyptian people. The governments and people of China and Egypt have provided good mutual support in the common struggle to safeguard peace and oppose colonialism. The Egyptian people have made great achievements in the struggle to safeguard their independence in the past four years, and we wish them greater success in future struggles!

### 埃及人民光荣的四年

　　埃及人民光荣的四年
    埃及共和国成立已经四周年了。这是埃及人民光荣的四年。在这四年中，埃及人民为了争取维护自己民族的自由和独立，表现了不屈不挠的坚强意志。他们不仅捍卫住了自己国家的独立主权，而且为世世代代遭受殖民主义压迫的中东阿拉伯民族开辟了走向独立的道路。在埃及人民欢庆自己伟大节日的时候，中国人民向他们表示热烈的祝贺和最大的敬意。
    四年前，埃及人民在驱逐了代表外国殖民利益和国内封建势力的国王法鲁克之后，宣布废除君主制，建立独立的共和国，从此，埃及就像一个巨人一样站起来了。埃及人民在以纳赛尔总统为首的共和国政府的领导之下，努力团结一切阿拉伯国家，奉行积极的和平中立政策，为捍卫和平和反对西方殖民主义压迫的崇高事业作了杰出的贡献。埃及人民为彻底摆脱殖民束缚和进一步在经济上求得独立发展，收回了长期被殖民主义者霸占的苏伊士运河公司，废除了运河区的英国军事基地，并把在埃及土地上的外国石油企业、银行和保险公司收归埃及所有或改由埃及人经营。同时，埃及人民在实行土地制度改革，建设自己的民族工业，开发水利资源等建设方面，也得到了良好的进展。埃及人民维护国家独立主权的英勇斗争，和他们所取得的伟大成就，使中东阿拉伯民族争取独立解放的运动蓬勃发展，使久经苦难的埃及人民和其他阿拉伯人民扬眉吐气，使一切侵略中东地区的殖民主义者胆战心惊！
    当然，埃及走向独立的道路并不是平坦的。埃及人民为了争取独立和自由，曾同西方殖民主义者进行过近百年的英勇斗争。正因为埃及人民久经考验，深知自己的独立得来不易，在去年打退英法和以色列侵略者夺取苏伊士运河的战争中，表现了英勇的战斗精神和极大的爱国热情。而在战争结束以后，埃及人民为克服英法侵略战争所带来的经济困难，为恢复苏伊士运河通航，为打击殖民国家继续夺取苏伊士运河的政治阴谋和各种压力，同样表现了极大的勇敢和坚毅。在埃及人民这种英勇不屈的斗争精神面前，傲慢的西方殖民者不得不低下头来，被迫承认埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，并按照埃及的条件向埃及运河公司缴纳通行费，恢复使用运河。
    但是，埃及人民维护独立的斗争还没有结束。旧殖民主义的英法的侵略虽然已经被打退了，而新殖民主义的美国却正在把它的侵略势力伸入中东地区。正像纳赛尔总统最近对美国“展望”杂志编辑所说的，英法两国和美国的区别在于：一个想用炸弹消灭我们，而美国想用“和平手段”——经济压力和饥饿来达到目的。现在，美国为实行“艾森豪威尔主义”，控制整个中东地区，正加紧对阿拉伯国家的民族主义力量进攻。美国颠复约旦民族主义政府，密谋进一步破坏埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦的四国联盟关系，策动组织亲美的所谓“东阿拉伯联盟”，就是企图分裂阿拉伯国家之间的民族团结，孤立埃及和叙利亚，达到它利用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人、分而治之的侵略目的。美国除继续对埃及施加经济压力外，还唆使以色列对埃及进行战争挑衅，并力图在埃及和叙利亚内部制造混乱和不安。这说明美帝国主义是今天埃及人民和中东阿拉伯民族的最凶恶的敌人。
    最近一个时期，美国积极在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略政策，参加了巴格达条约集团的军事委员会，拉拢了某些阿拉伯国家的少数上层人物，露骨地敌视阿拉伯民族主义。它的活动是十分猖狂的。但是，正是由于这些侵略活动，美帝国主义的殖民面目已经更加清楚地暴露在阿拉伯各国人民的眼前了。我们相信，决定阿拉伯国家人民命运的，是阿拉伯国家的广大人民自己。阿拉伯国家人民正像埃及人民一样，现在已经觉醒或正在日益觉醒起来，他们争取自己国家的独立解放运动，是任何侵略势力也阻挡不住的。只要中东阿拉伯国家继续加强团结，坚决同西方殖民主义特别是美帝国主义进行斗争，就一定会使美国最后在中东地区遭到比英法更惨重的失败。
    埃及人民争取独立解放的事业，是正义的事业。埃及人民在民族独立斗争中所走的道路，是全阿拉伯人民的正确道路。埃及人民一定会继续得到阿拉伯各国人民和世界正义人类的支持。中国人民同埃及人民有着很好的友好关系。中埃两国政府和人民在维护和平和反对殖民主义的共同斗争中，曾进行了很好的互相支持。埃及人民四年来在维护自己的独立的斗争中已经取得伟大的成就，祝他们在未来的斗争中获得更大的成功！
