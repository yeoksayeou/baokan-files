　　Sixteen Leaders of the China Association for Promoting Democracy Unanimously Expressed That They Must Resolutely Draw a Line Between Themselves and Anti-Socialist Elements

　　(Our Newspaper) News - The China Association for Promoting Democracy convened a symposium last night for heads of central departments and central committee members and alternate central committee members in Beijing to discuss how to help the Communist Party with its rectification campaign. Speakers at the meeting unanimously pointed out that in order for democratic parties to help the Communist Party carry out the rectification campaign effectively, they must distinguish between anti-Party, anti-socialist elements and opposition to the "three evils." Speakers also criticized all anti-Party, anti-socialist, or revisionist remarks.

　　Xu Guangping said: Drawing a line is for the sake of better "letting go," and definitely not for the sake of "reining in."

　　The meeting was presided over by Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. At the beginning of the meeting, she said: Recently, there have been various situations with "voicing" and "letting go." Generally speaking, the vast majority are correct, and although there are some different opinions, the starting point is well-intentioned. This is one aspect. On the other hand, anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies have also emerged. Obvious examples include the ranting of people like Ge Peiqi, who appear as clowns; and the remarks of intellectuals, such as the so-called "Party's world" statement by Chu Anping, editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily. I really don't know what position these people are taking. They use certain pretexts to mislead people and oppose the leadership of the Party, which we cannot agree with at all. Because the people want the Communist Party, and the people want to defend the victorious achievements gained through hardship. Today, the whole world is moving towards the socialist road, and it is impossible for them to drag us back. Their speeches are no longer sincere help to the Party in its rectification campaign. We must draw a line with this kind of malicious fallacy. Drawing a line is for the sake of better "letting go," and definitely not for the sake of "reining in." We must better implement the policy of "voicing" and "letting go." We must not only continue to "voice" and "let go," but also engage in major debates. The time for major debates has arrived. Only in the midst of debate can right and wrong be distinguished. The more one debates, the clearer right and wrong become.

　　The next speaker was Wu Yanin. He believes that in the current great blooming and contending, there can be divided into three factions. The first faction is those who completely support the Party's leadership and the socialist line. The second faction is a very small number of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, like Ge Peiqi, who completely stand on a hostile, counter-revolutionary position. The third faction is somewhere in between, seemingly supporting the Party's leadership and the socialist line, but also seemingly not fully agreeing with the Party's leadership and the socialist line. He said: There are not too many of these people, and they are still people within the ranks of the people, not enemies. Some of their thoughts are confused, and their positions may not be firm. Some are trying to gain popularity and express themselves for a moment, deliberately shocking people. If they accept criticism, the problem is not too big. He said: Our members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy must draw a line with counter-revolutionary elements; we must also distinguish clearly between rash, distorted, and sensational muddled thinking, and not be confused by them.

　　Regarding Wu Yanin's views on "seeking popularity" and other issues in his speech, other speakers had different opinions. Liang Chunfu, Lei Jieqiong, Xu Boxin, Zheng Xiaoxun and others believed that some people's reactionary remarks are not this type of problem at all, but a problem of position. Xu Boxin said: Chu Anping's statement about the "Party's world" is a distortion of the facts, and we must draw a line with these thoughts. Zheng Xiaoxun said that because Chu Anping's remarks may confuse some people, they should be exposed and criticized in a timely manner. Although Chu Anping is the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, the organ of various democratic parties, his ideological errors and distortions of facts cannot represent the various democratic parties.

　　Wang Shao'ao said: What we should pay attention to now is revisionism that, on the surface, does not oppose the Communist Party or socialism, but in reality opposes the Communist Party and socialism.

　　Wang Shao'ao, vice chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, further pointed out that Chu Anping and others' fallacies are anti-Party and anti-socialist revisionism. Wang Shao'ao said that Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou's speeches are clear reactionary thoughts, and what we should pay attention to now is revisionism that, on the surface, does not oppose the Communist Party or socialism, but in reality opposes the Communist Party and socialism. He believes that Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping and others' arguments are revisionist. He said that Zhang Naiqi considers himself a Marxist-Leninist, but in reality, he is replacing Marxism-Leninism with revisionism. He advocated conducting severe criticism of revisionism, because revisionism easily confuses right and wrong, and also has a following behind it.

　　Many people present talked about how the various democratic parties participated in the formulation of the country's important laws and policies, and the Constitution was even discussed by the people of the whole country. Wang Baochu talked in his speech that he had raised amendments during the discussion of the draft Constitution, which were adopted. Therefore, Ni Zhihuang asked in his speech: Since the facts are like this, why do some heads of democratic parties who hold ministerial positions in the government say that the Communist Party produced the finished product and let the democratic parties raise their hands to pass it? Why do they still publish fallacies? Is this ulterior motives? Ni Zhihuang said that he heard that someone wanted to be the Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China. Please examine yourself as to whether this is true.

　　Someone asked in a speech: "Ge Peiqi said such reactionary things, did the reporter write his words too excessively?" The reporter of this newspaper immediately explained to the chairman and the chairman announced: Ge Peiqi's speech was read and modified by himself. The venue burst into laughter.

　　Regarding the discussions at this meeting, Xu Guangping said in his final speech:

　　Today's meeting was very good. Everyone unanimously pointed out the following four points:

　　1. The sole purpose of helping the Party with its rectification campaign is to expand socialist democracy, further consolidate the Party's leadership, and better build socialism. We have complete confidence in this point because we trust the Party's correct leadership, and because this fully conforms to the interests of the people of the whole country.

　　2. To help the Party carry out the rectification campaign effectively, we must draw a line between anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and opposition to the "three evils." Therefore, we must conduct serious criticism and struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. In particular, we must pay attention to exposing those remarks that smuggle in revisionism under the guise of opposing dogmatism, because these remarks wear the disguise of Marxism-Leninism, are deceptive, and are particularly dangerous.

　　3. Criticizing and struggling against all anti-Party, anti-socialist, or any revisionist remarks is precisely for the purpose of better implementing the policy of bold airing of views. Only in this way can we start from the desire for unity and achieve new unity. Otherwise, if we allow all fallacies to run rampant and indulge them, it will be detrimental to unity.

　　4. The Party's rectification policy is unwavering. We should boldly air our views without reservation. Only by great blooming, great contending, and great debate can we be considered to be seriously helping the Party with its rectification campaign. There can be criticism, and there can be counter-criticism. The more one debates, the clearer the truth becomes. We cannot think it is "reining in" as soon as we hear counter-criticism. There is only "letting go," and there is no issue of "reining in." Seriously helping the Party carry out the rectification campaign is also a process of self-transformation and improvement for us. This is also a test for our members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.

　　The following people spoke at this meeting: Wu Yanin, Feng Binfu, Yan Jingyao, Liang Chunfu, Wu Baozan, Wang Baochu, Lei Jieqiong, Zheng Xiaoxun, Wang Hongzhen, Chen Linrui, Wang Ligeng, Ni Zhihuang, Lu Gaoyi, Xu Boxin, Wang Shao'ao.

　　Yang Dongchun was absent due to illness and submitted a written statement.

　　The following are the main points of Liang Chunfu and Lei Jieqiong's speeches:

　　Liang Chunfu said that tearing down the wall cannot tear down the Communist Party's leadership. Negating the Party's leadership is actually negating the existence of the democratic parties.

　　Liang Chunfu talked about two issues.

　　First, the issue of tearing down the wall. In the rectification movement, the issue discussed the most is the issue of tearing down the wall. It is undeniable that there are walls of varying heights and thicknesses between individual Party members or individual Party organizations and people outside the Party. This is why the Party specifically raised the issue of sectarianism in this rectification campaign. But if this phenomenon is exaggerated as something essential, saying that the wall (or sectarianism) exists between the entire Communist Party and people outside the Party and the masses of people, this is turning a blind eye to the great practice of the Communist Party's united front policy. If we tear it down in this way, we will inevitably tear down the Communist Party's leadership. Is this a question of stance, which is worth studying. If the Communist Party's leadership is torn down, who will lead us to build socialism? Is it the bourgeois industrialists and businessmen? Is it the intellectuals from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie? History has already concluded on this issue. Therefore, the so-called "Party's world" argument is incompatible with socialism. However, some leaders of the democratic parties have put forward similar arguments. For example, Chu Anping said that the Party's world is the root cause of sectarianism. Chen Xingui also made similar speeches. Others, such as the People's Congress, the CPPCC, and government departments, are all said to be the same as not holding meetings, with positions but no power, and said to be a one-party dictatorship.

　　Now, all the democratic parties were established during the Kuomintang era. Let us think about whether the Kuomintang allowed the democratic parties to participate in the government at that time? No. And many democratic people have been persecuted. Now, the democratic parties not only participate in the government but have also developed greatly. Some people think that participating in the government and organizational development are just formalities and can be examined. Have the democratic parties participated in basic legislation in the past? And the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was not only passed by us raising our hands, but also participated in the formulation by us. Isn't this a clear rebuttal to Mr. Zhang Bojun's argument? We also participated in the formulation of some guidelines and policies. Needless to say, the implementation of policies, members of the democratic parties have participated in government work. Of course, the style of individual party members is not good, but it cannot be said that the entire party is sectarianism or the Party's world. If you say that, it is a matter of standpoint.

　　Supporting socialism cannot be just an empty slogan. What kind of socialism is built by negating the leadership of the Party? Negating the Party's leadership is actually negating the existence of the democratic parties. Saying that it is now the "Party's world" and wanting to replace it, then if the Kuomintang comes back, and American imperialism comes back, can our democratic parties exist? This kind of argument must be refuted, and there can be no politeness.

　　The main content of the rectification is to correctly handle the problem of contradictions among the people. This is a new problem, different from the problem of handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Therefore, there is a problem of methods here. According to the rectification instructions, the rectification movement is both a serious and earnest ideological education movement. It cannot adopt the method of cruel struggle and merciless blows, just like handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Now, most of them are carried out in this spirit. But there are also people who do not use this method. One type of people is malicious, such as the two lecturers at Renmin University, and those who write threatening letters (it is said that others have also received threatening letters). It is not yet certain whether some other people are malicious. Only allowing criticism and not allowing others to counter-criticize will also produce the same effect. Now we are dealing with contradictions among the people, so we must adhere to the gentle and drizzling approach.

　　Lei Jieqiong said: Some people have led the opposition to bureaucracy to opposition to socialism, and have led the opposition to dogmatism to opposition to Marxism-Leninism. These reactionary remarks must be severely criticized.

　　Lei Jieqiong said that since the rectification, a vigorous atmosphere has emerged. However, some people have revealed reactionary ideas in the rectification movement. For example, some people say that bureaucracy is worse than capitalism, which is to lead the opposition to bureaucracy to opposition to socialism. Some people, when they mention the opposition to dogmatism, think of Marxism-Leninism, equating the two, which is to lead the opposition to dogmatism to opposition to Marxism-Leninism. Some people attribute sectarianism to the "Party's world," leading the opposition to sectarianism to the opposition to the Communist Party. Regarding these, we will not investigate the subjective motives, but this is not to seek popularity, but a question of stance. Logically speaking, since it is opposition to socialism and opposition to the Party, it is reactionary and anti-people. From the objective effect, these remarks of theirs are "pleasing to the enemy and painful to our friends." Now, although class struggle has basically ended, there are still bad people and counter-revolutionaries. Not to mention that American imperialism is constantly trying to carry out sabotage. But some people, as leaders of democratic parties and leaders of government departments, actually put forward this kind of specious theory, what impact will this have! Now, many heads of departments in the government are democratic people, but some people say that this is the "Party's world." This is not in accordance with the facts!

　　These remarks are reactionary, but they are still problems within the ranks of the people. But we must draw a line with this kind of thinking and not condone or tolerate it. We cannot think that their subjective motives may not be bad, that it is confused thinking, and so on. We must severely criticize these remarks so that they can recognize their ideological errors and achieve unity on a new basis. But if we treat these reactionary remarks carelessly, it is unprincipled, and we will not be able to achieve true unity, it will be a marriage of convenience.

　　We cannot let reactionary remarks raise their heads. Indulgence will encourage their behavior. Severe criticism is to help them distinguish between enemy and us. Only in this way can we achieve great blooming and great contending, not chaotic blooming and chaotic contending, and the rectification movement can embark on a healthy path.

### 十六位民进领导者一致表示  必须坚决同反社会主义分子划清界限

　　十六位民进领导者一致表示
　　必须坚决同反社会主义分子划清界限
    本报讯  中国民主促进会昨晚召集中央各部负责人和在北京的中央委员、候补中央委员举行座谈会，讨论如何帮助共产党整风。会上发言的人一致指出：民主党派要帮助共产党搞好整风，必须划清反党、反社会主义与反对“三害”的界限。发言人并对一切反党、反社会主义或修正主义言论进行了批判。
    许广平说：划清界限是为了更好地放，决不是为了收。
    会议由中国民主促进会副主席许广平主持。会议开始时她说：最近“鸣”和“放”有多种多样的情况，大致看来，绝大多数是正确的，虽有一些不同意见，但出发点是善意的，这是一方面。另外也出现了反党、反社会主义的谬论，明显的如葛佩琦之流是以丑角的面目破口大骂；也有以知识分子的面目出现，如光明日报的总编辑储安平的所谓
  “党天下”的言论。我真不知道这些人究竟站在什么样的立场。他们利用某种幌子，叫人迷失方向，反对党的领导，我们根本不能同意。因为人民是要共产党的，人民要保卫从艰难困苦中得来的胜利成果。今天全世界都向着社会主义的大路走，他们要想把我们拖回去，那是不可能的。他们的发言已经不是诚恳帮助党整风了，我们必须同这种恶毒的谬论划清界限。划清界限是为了更好地放，决不是为了收。我们一定要更好地贯彻“鸣”“放”政策，不但要继续“鸣”“放”，而且还要大争。现在已经到了大争的时候了。只有在争的当中，才能辨明是非。是非是越辩越明的。
    接着发言的是吴研因。他认为目前在大放大鸣中可分为三派，一派是对党的领导和社会主义路线是完全拥护的，另一派是极少数的反党、反社会主义的分子，像葛佩琦之类，完全是站在敌对的反革命立场上；还有一派是介于两者之间，好像拥护党的领导和社会主义路线的，但又好像对党的领导和社会主义路线不完全赞成。他说：这些人不太多，也还是人民内部的人，不是敌人，他们的思想有的是糊涂，立场也许没有站稳，有的是哗众取宠，快意一时，故意惊人。如果他们接受批评，问题也不大。他说：我们民进同志必须和反革命分子划清界限；对轻率的、歪曲事实的和哗众取宠的糊涂思想，也要分辨清楚，不受它们的淆惑。
    对于吴研因在发言中谈到的“哗众取宠”等看法，其他发言人有不同的意见。梁纯夫、雷洁琼和徐伯昕、郑效洵等认为，有些人的反动言论根本不是这类问题，而是立场问题。徐伯昕说：储安平关于“党天下”的说法，是抹杀事实的，必须要同这些思想划清界限。郑效洵说，因为储安平的言论可能迷惑一些人，应该及时给以揭露、批评。储安平虽然是各民主党派的机关报——光明日报的总编辑，但是，思想错误、歪曲事实，是不能代表各民主党派的。
    王绍鏊说：现在要注意的是表面上不反对共产党、不反对社会主义而在实际上反对共产党、反对社会主义的修正主义。
    民进副主席王绍鏊进一步指出储安平等的谬论是反党、反社会主义的修正主义。王绍鏊说，葛佩琦、王德周的发言是鲜明的反动思想，现在要注意的是表面上不反对共产党、不反对社会主义而在实际上反对共产党、反对社会主义的修正主义。他认为章伯钧、章乃器、储安平等的论点就是修正主义。他说，章乃器自以为是马列主义，实际上是以修正主义代替马列主义。他主张要对修正主义进行严厉的批判，因为修正主义容易混淆是非，而且背后还有群众。
    在座的许多人都谈到，国家各种重要法律、政策的制定，各民主党派都参加了，宪法并且经过全国人民的讨论。王宝初在发言中谈到，在讨论宪法草案时，他曾经提出过修改意见，被采纳了。因此，倪之璜在发言中问道：事实既是这样，为什么有些担任政府部长职务的民主党派的负责人竟说共产党拿出成品让民主党派举手通过呢？为什么还发表谬论呢？这是不是别有用心？倪之璜说，听说有人想做中华人民共和国副主席，是否如此，请他自己检查。
    有人在发言中曾经问道：“葛佩琦说出那样反动的话来，是不是记者把他的话写得过火了？”本报记者当场向主席作了解释并由主席宣布：葛佩琦的发言是经过他本人看过并作过修饰的。会场哄然而笑。
    对这次会议讨论的情况，许广平在最后发言中说：
    今天的会开的很好。大家一致指出下面四点：
    一、帮助党整风，唯一目的是为了扩大社会主义民主，进一步巩固党的领导，更好地建设社会主义。我们对于这点完全有信心，因为我们信任党的正确领导，因为这完全符合全国人民的利益。
    二、帮助党搞好整风，必须划清反党反社会主义与反对“三害”的界限。因之对于一切反党、反社会主义的言行必须进行严肃的批判和斗争。尤其是对于那些在反对教条主义幌子下偷运修正主义的言论，必须加以注意揭发，因为这种言论披着马列主义的伪装，且有欺骗性，是特别危险的。
    三、对一切反党、反社会主义或任何修正主义言论进行批评和斗争，正是为了更好地贯彻大胆鸣放的方针。只有这样才能从团结愿望出发，达到新的团结。否则，如果对一切谬论，听任自流，予以纵容，反而是不利于团结的。
    四、党的整风方针是坚定不移的。我们应该无保留地大胆鸣放。只有大放大鸣大争，才算是认真帮助党整风。可以有批评，也可以有反批评。真理愈辩愈明。不能一听到反批评，就认为是“收”。只有“放”，不发生“收”的问题。认真帮助党搞好整风，同时是我们进行自我改造和提高的过程。这对于我们民进成员也是一个考验。
    在这次会上先后发言的人有：吴研因、冯宾符、严景耀、梁纯夫、巫宝三、王宝初、雷洁琼、郑效洵、王鸿桢、陈麟瑞、王历耕、倪之璜、陆高谊、徐伯昕、王绍鏊。
    杨东莼因病请假没有出席，他作了书面发言。
    下面是梁纯夫和雷洁琼的发言要点：
    梁纯夫说，拆墙不能把共产党的领导权拆掉。否定党的领导，实际上也是否定民主党派的存在。
    梁纯夫谈了两个问题。
    第一，拆墙问题。在整风运动中，大家谈得最多的是拆墙问题。在个别党员或个别党组织同党外人士之间存在着高低厚薄不同的墙，这是不可否认的。这就是为什么党在这次整风中特别提出宗派主义的问题。但如果把这种现象夸大为本质的东西，说墙（或宗派主义）是存在于整个共产党同党外人士和人民群众之间，这是闭眼不看共产党统一战线政策的伟大实践。照这样拆下去，就必然要把共产党的领导权也要拆掉。这是不是立场问题，就是值得研究的了。如果把共产党的领导权拆掉后，谁来领导我们建设社会主义呢？是资产阶级的工商界人士吗？是资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的知识分子吗？历史已对这个问题作了结论。因此，所谓“党天下”的论调，是同社会主义不相容的。可是民主党派的有些负责人，出现了类似的论调。如储安平说，党天下是宗派主义的根源。陈新桂也有类似的发言。其他如把人民代表大会、政协和政府部门，都说成开会等于不开，有职无权，说成一党专政。
    现在各民主党派，都是国民党时代建立起来的。我们想想，那时国民党有没有允许各民主党派参加政权？没有。并且有很多民主人士都受过迫害。现在各民主党派不但参加政权，而且得到了很大发展。有人认为参加政权、组织发展都是形式，可以检查一下。过去民主党派是不是参加过基本立法呢？而中华人民共和国的宪法不但是我们举手通过，而且是我们参加制订的。这不是明显的驳斥了章伯钧先生的论调么？一些方针政策我们也参加了制订。执行政策更不用说了，各民主党派成员都参加了政府工作。当然个别党员作风是不好的，但不能说整个党是宗派主义、党天下。如果这样说，就是立场问题。
    赞成社会主义不能只是空喊。否定党的领导，建设什么样的社会主义？否定党的领导，实际上也是否定各民主党派的存在。说现在是“党天下”，要换掉，那么国民党回来，美帝国主义回来，我们民主党派能存在么？对这种论调，必须予以驳斥，不能客气。
    整风主要内容是正确处理人民内部矛盾问题。这是新的问题，与处理敌我矛盾问题不同。因此这里有方法问题。按照整风指示，整风运动是既严肃又认真的思想教育运动，不能采取残酷斗争，无情打击的方法，像处理敌我矛盾一样。现在大多数是按这种精神进行的。但也有人不是用这种方法。一种人是恶意的，如人民大学的两位讲师，还有写恫吓信的人（据说还有其他人也接到恫吓信）。另一些人是否恶意还不能确定。只许批评而不许别人反批评，也会产生同样的效果。现在是处理人民内部矛盾，必须坚持和风细雨的方式。
    雷洁琼说：有人把反对官僚主义引到反对社会主义，把反对教条主义引到反对马列主义，把反对宗派主义引到反对共产党。对于这些反动言论，必须进行严厉批评。
    雷洁琼说，整风以来，出现了蓬蓬勃勃气象。但有人在整风运动中，表露出反动思想。如有人说官僚主义比资本主义还坏，这是把反对官僚主义引到反对社会主义。有人一提到反对教条主义，就想到马列主义，把二者等量齐观，这是把反教条主义引到反马列主义。有人把宗派主义归结到“党天下”，把反对宗派主义引到反对共产党。对这些，主观动机不去追究，但这不是哗众取宠，而是立场问题。从逻辑上看，既然是反对社会主义、反对党，就是反动的，反人民的。从客观效果上看，他们这些言论，是“仇者所快，亲者所痛”的。现在，阶级斗争虽然基本结束，但还有坏人，还有反革命。更不用说美帝国主义在时刻企图进行破坏。但是有些人身为民主党派负责人、政府部门负责人，竟发出这种似是而非的理论，这会发生甚么影响！现在政府许多部门负责人是民主人士，但有人说这是“党天下”。这是不符合事实的！
    这些言论是反动的，不过也还是人民内部问题。但是要同这种思想划清界限，不能纵容、姑息。不能认为他们主观动机可能不坏，是糊涂思想，等等。要对这些言论进行严厉批评，使他们认识思想错误，在新的基础上达到团结。但如果马马虎虎对待这种反动言论，就是无原则，就不能达到真正团结，就会是同床异梦。
    我们不能放纵反动言论抬头。放纵就会鼓励他们的行为。严厉批评是帮助他们分清敌我思想。这样才能做到大放大鸣而不是乱放乱鸣，整风运动才能走上健康道路。
