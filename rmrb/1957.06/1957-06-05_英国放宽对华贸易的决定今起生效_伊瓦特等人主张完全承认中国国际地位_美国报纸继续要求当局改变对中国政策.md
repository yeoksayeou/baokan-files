Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: The British Board of Trade announced on June 3rd that the decision to relax British trade restrictions with China will take effect from June 5th. On the same day, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ormsby-Gore told the House of Commons that a new unified list of products that can be exported to the Soviet Union and China will be announced soon.

There are also reports that the British government will soon make recommendations to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), requesting that Western countries jointly relax the "embargo" against the Soviet Union and China.

Meanwhile, Labor MP Crossman and Australian Labor Party leader Ewart demanded full recognition of China's international status after the relaxation of the trade embargo with China.

Crossman wrote in the "Daily Mirror" on the 4th: The British Foreign Secretary should now turn to the much more important task of admitting China to the United Nations Security Council.

Ewart spoke at the Commonwealth Labor Parties conference currently being held in England on the 3rd, saying: "Most Commonwealth countries want to expand trade with China and fully recognize its international status." He accused Dulles and the U.S. China lobby of consistently combining to veto proposals that would allow China and Commonwealth countries to benefit from full trade and full recognition.

According to news from New York: The American press continues to demand that the U.S. authorities change their policy towards China.

A "Daily Worker" editorial pointed out that the Taipei incident has confronted the United States with the need to change its policy towards China. The editorial said that, in accordance with its own interests, the United States should recognize China, restore China's legitimate status in the United Nations, and fulfill its wartime guarantee to return Taiwan to China.

The editorial also mentioned the relaxation of trade restrictions with China by Britain and other Western countries. It said that this is proof of the growing dissatisfaction with the State Department's foolish behavior and economic Cold War practices. American journalist Cowles (Chairman of the Board of "Des Moines Register and Tribune" and General Manager of "Minneapolis Star and Tribune") stated on June 2nd that he disagreed with some people in the United States who called the request to review China policy a treasonous act. He said that current policy is leading the United States "down a dead-end road, with the result that only disgraceful diplomacy will be encountered." Cowles also accused Dulles of a rigid attitude in not allowing American journalists to come to China.

The "New York Times" pointed out on June 2nd: "Until now, the prevailing opinion in the United States has been in favor of continuing to implement the established China policy. But now external pressure may isolate the United States on this policy, and at the same time, questions have been raised about the consolidation of the US-Nationalist Party relationship." The newspaper's United Nations reporter Hamilton published an article advocating revising the US policy toward China. He said that China's entry into the United Nations seems inevitable. However, this reporter echoed some arguments for splitting China and occupying Taiwan. He said that the United States should "act quickly" to make Taiwan "independent" or "trusteeship," and make the UN General Assembly give Taiwan "separate membership" as a "condition" for admitting China into the United Nations.

According to news from Paris: Former Chairman of the French National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, Édouard Bonnefous, advocated on June 3rd that France recognize China.

The Democratic and Social Union of Resistance MP, who had served as a minister, said: "France should learn from Britain's example and recognize China, but without falling out with the United States."

    英国放宽对华贸易的决定今起生效
    伊瓦特等人主张完全承认中国国际地位
    美国报纸继续要求当局改变对中国政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社4日讯：英国贸易部3日宣布，放宽英国对中国贸易限制的决定将从6月5日起生效。同一天，协办外交事务国务大臣欧姆斯比—戈尔在下院说，不久将公布一项可以向苏联和中国出口的产品的新的统一货单。
    还有消息说，英国政府不久将向巴黎统筹委员会提出建议，要求西方国家共同放宽对苏联及中国的“禁运”。
    同时，工党议员克罗斯曼和澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特要求在放宽对华贸易禁运以后，完全承认中国的国际地位。
    克罗斯曼在4日的“每日镜报”上著文说：英国外交大臣现在应该转而解决接纳中国参加联合国安全理事会这个更加重要得多的任务。
    伊瓦特3日在现在正在英格兰举行的英联邦各国工党会议上发言，他说：“英联邦大多数国家都想扩大对华贸易，完全承认它的国际地位。”他指责杜勒斯和美国院外援华集团一贯结合在一起，否决使中国和英联邦国家能够得到充分贸易和完全承认的好处的各种建议。
    据纽约消息：美国新闻界继续要求美国当局改变对中国的政策。
    纽约“工人日报”社论指出，台北事件使美国面临必须改变对中国政策的情况。社论说，根据美国自身的利益，美国应该承认中国，恢复中国在联合国组织中的合法地位，并且履行在大战期间的保证：把台湾归还给中国。
    社论还谈到英国和其他西方国家要放宽对华贸易限制。它说，这是对国务院愚蠢行为和经济冷战做法不满情绪日益高涨的证明。美国报人考尔斯（“得梅因纪事论坛报”董事会主席和“明尼阿波尼斯明星论坛报”总经理）在6月2日表示，他不同意美国有些人把要求审议对中国政策称为叛国行为。他说，目前政策正引导美国“走向穷途末路，结果只有遭到丢脸的外交”。考尔斯还指责杜勒斯不让美国新闻记者来中国的僵硬态度。
    “纽约时报”6月2日指出：“到现在为止，在美国占上风的意见是赞成继续执行根据既定方针制订的对华政策。但是现在外界压力可能要使美国在这个政策上陷于孤立，同时已经有人对美国—国民党关系的巩固性提出了疑问。”这家报纸驻联合国记者汉密尔顿发表了一篇主张修改美国的对华政策文章，他说，中国进入联合国看来是不可避免的。但是，这个记者却又附和某些分裂中国和霸占台湾的论调。他说，美国应该“赶快采取行动”，使台湾“独立”或者“托管”，并且使联合国大会以给予台湾以“单独的会员国资格”作为接纳中国进入联合国的“条件”。
    另据巴黎消息：法国前国民议会外交委员会主席埃德华·庞纳福6月3日主张法国承认中国。
    这位曾任部长的民主社会抵抗联盟议员说：“法国应该学习英国的榜样，承认中国，但是不要跟美国闹翻。”
