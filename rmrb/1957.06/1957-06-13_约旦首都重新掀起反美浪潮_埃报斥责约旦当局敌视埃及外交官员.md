Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
According to a report in the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Telegraph," a large-scale demonstration took place in Amman, the capital of Jordan, on June 10th. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine!" and "Down with the conspirators!" They demanded the release of all political prisoners. Clashes occurred between the demonstrators and the police.
According to sources in Amman, the number of people arrested in Jordan has reached 3,000. Many schools and barracks have been turned into concentration camps, where arrested political prisoners are subjected to severe torture.
A Middle East News Agency report states that the American ambassador to Amman, Mr. Mallory, handed over a list of Jordanian patriots to the Jordanian government and demanded their arrest. When publishing this news, Egyptian newspapers pointed out that the American ambassador played an active role in suppressing the Jordanian national movement.
The Egyptian weekly "Liberation" reported that the Jordanian reactionary clique is attempting to invite General Glubb, the British military dictator in Jordan who was driven out by the Jordanian people in March last year, back to Jordan. A group of officers and some Bedouin forces who are under strong reactionary influence are demanding this.
According to news from Cairo: At the request of the Egyptian government, the Jordanian ambassador to Egypt, Mr. Rifai, left Cairo for Amman on June 11.
On the same day, the Egyptian military attaché to Amman, Lieutenant Colonel Hilal, and the Egyptian Consul-General in Jerusalem, Mr. Aziz, who were expelled by the Jordanian government, returned to Cairo. Lieutenant Colonel Hilal said that when he left Amman, Jordanian police closely surrounded the Egyptian embassy there. At the same time, the Egyptian government published the confession of a Jordanian secret agent who attempted to frame the Egyptian military attaché to Amman, Lieutenant Colonel Hilal, and photographs of the pistol and small tape recorder carried by the Jordanian secret agent when he was detained by the Egyptian military attaché.
On the other hand, the Jordanian government issued a statement attempting to deny Egypt's accusations that Jordan was trying to frame the Egyptian military attaché. The Jordanian government claimed that it had "evidence" that could accuse the Egyptian military attaché.
Cairo newspapers on June 11 strongly condemned Jordan's hostile actions against Egyptian officials.
"Al-Ahram" said that Jordan's actions are also a betrayal of the Jordanian people themselves, because the purpose of the conspiracy against Egyptian diplomats is to secretly undermine the friendly relations between Egypt and Jordan. This action will also lead Jordan to completely sever ties with Egypt, which often stands by its side against imperialist conspiracies.
"Al-Gomhouria" recalled that since Jordan deviated from the policy of the Arab liberation front, the main goal of the Jordanian rulers has been to undermine Egypt's credibility by making unfounded accusations against Egypt, attempting to isolate it among other countries in the Arab world.
"Al-Akhbar" said that the main responsibility for all anti-Egyptian provocations should be borne by imperialism, and the purpose of these provocations is clearly to undermine the Arab nationalist forces that imperialism fears.

### 约旦首都重新掀起反美浪潮  埃报斥责约旦当局敌视埃及外交官员

　　约旦首都重新掀起反美浪潮
    埃报斥责约旦当局敌视埃及外交官员
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：黎巴嫩“电讯报”报道，约旦首都安曼在10日举行了声势浩大的人民群众示威游行，参加示威游行的人高呼：“打倒艾森豪威尔主义！”“打倒阴谋者！”他们要求释放一切政治犯。示威者和警察发生了冲突。
    根据安曼的消息，目前约旦被逮捕的人已达到三千人。许多学校和兵营变成了集中营，被捕的政治犯在集中营里遭到严刑拷问。
    中东通讯社消息，美国驻安曼大使马洛里把一份约旦爱国人士的名单交给约旦政府，并且要求逮捕他们。埃及报纸在发表这个消息的时候指出，美国大使在镇压约旦民族运动中起了积极作用。
    埃及“解放”周刊报道，约旦反动集团企图把去年3月被约旦人民赶走的英国在约旦的军事独裁者格拉布将军请回来。一批军官和一些受着强烈的反动影响的贝都印部队在要求这样做。
    另据开罗消息：在埃及政府要求下，约旦驻埃及大使里法伊已经在6月11日离开罗回安曼。
    同一天，被约旦政府驱逐的埃及驻安曼武官希拉尔和埃及驻耶路撒冷总领事阿齐兹回到了开罗。希拉尔中校说，当他离开安曼时，约旦警察紧紧地包围了那里的埃及大使馆。与此同时，埃及政府发表了企图陷害埃及驻安曼武官希拉尔中校的约旦特务的供词和这个约旦特务被埃及武官扣留时身上所携带的手枪和小型录音机的照片。
    另一方面，约旦政府发表声明，企图否认埃及提出的关于约旦要陷害埃及武官的指责。约旦政府自称它握有可以指控埃及武官的“证据”。
    开罗报纸6月11日强烈谴责约旦对埃及官员采取的敌视行动。
    “金字塔报”说，约旦这一行动也是背叛约旦人民本身的做法，因为反对埃及外交官的阴谋的目的是想暗中破坏埃约两国的友好关系。这一行动也会促使约旦同经常站在自己一边反对帝国主义阴谋的埃及完全脱离联系。
    “共和国报”回顾说，自从约旦背离阿拉伯解放阵线的政策以来，约旦统治者的主要目标一直是想通过对埃及提出没有根据的指控来破坏埃及的信誉，企图使它在阿拉伯世界其他国家中间孤立起来。
    “消息报”说，应该对一切反埃及的挑衅行为负主要责任的是帝国主义，这些挑衅行为的目的显然是想破坏帝国主义所害怕的阿拉伯民族主义力量。
