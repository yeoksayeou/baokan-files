　　As Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League,
　　Ma Xulun

We helped the Party in the rectification campaign with the sole purpose of consolidating the Party's leading core role, strengthening the Party's ties with the masses, and better building socialism. However, rightist ambitionists are taking advantage of this opportunity, muddying the waters, smuggling in various forms of revisionism, attempting to create chaos, and blurring people's understanding, in order to achieve their goal of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. This kind of trickery runs completely counter to the purpose of seriously helping the Party in the rectification campaign, completely violates the interests of the people of the whole country, and will never be tolerated by the people of the whole country.

In particular, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others who hold leadership positions in the China Democratic League, have spread extremely erroneous remarks, creating confusion and adverse effects among the people and within the China Democratic League. As a member of the China Democratic League and one of its vice chairmen, I cannot help but express my indignation. I agree with the views of many comrades in the China Democratic League that Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others should clearly state their attitude and position in the current serious ideological struggle, and should make a thorough confession of their wrong words and deeds. Luo Longji had seen Chu Anping's vicious anti-Party fallacy of "the Party's world" beforehand; Chu Anping is the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, and Zhang Bojun is the president of the Guangming Daily. We have reason to demand that the intricate connections and hidden background in this be brought to light. Otherwise, how can they gain the trust of the people if they verbally support socialism but actually oppose it; verbally support the Communist Party but secretly undermine the Party's leadership; having one set of ideas on the surface and another behind the scenes, doing one thing in public and another in private? How can they maintain the prestige of the leadership of the China Democratic League? Socialism is the great cause to which the happiness of our people and future generations is tied, and the victorious fruit of the sacrifices of countless advanced people with lofty ideals. We will never allow any rightist ambitionists to damage and undermine it. Therefore, we must strictly draw a line between ourselves and the anti-Party and anti-socialist thinking of the rightists. In the current serious political and ideological struggle between socialism and anti-socialism, we resolutely demand that right and wrong be distinguished and positions be clarified, and no ambiguity will be tolerated. Any evasive, two-faced excuses and tactics will not escape the eyes of the people. I have been ill for many years and rarely concerned myself with the affairs of the China Democratic League. But I love the China Democratic League, and I especially love socialism. I cannot but speak out and hope for guidance from my comrades in the China Democratic League. (June 15th)

　　不容许右派野心分子破坏社会主义
　　中国民主同盟副主席　马叙伦
    我们帮助党整风，唯一的目的是为了巩固党的领导核心作用，加强党与群众的联系，更好地建设社会主义。但是右派野心分子却利用这个机会，混水摸鱼，偷运形形色色的修正主义，妄图制造混乱，模糊人们的认识，以达其反党反社会主义的目的。这种勾当根本与严肃地帮助党整风的目的背道而驰，完全违反全国人民的利益，决非全国人民所能容忍。
    尤其是身任民盟领导的章伯钧、罗隆基等，竟然散布极端错误的言论，在人民群众和民盟中间造成混乱的、不良的影响，我作为民盟盟员和副主席之一，更不能不表示愤慨。我同意许多民盟同志的意见，章伯钧、罗隆基等应该对当前这场严肃的思想斗争明确表明态度和立场，应该对自己的错误言行作彻底的交代。储安平的所谓“党天下”的恶毒反党的谬论，罗隆基是事先看过的；储安平是光明日报的总编辑，而章伯钧又是光明日报的社长，这中间千丝万缕的瓜葛，暗中究竟包含着怎样的背景，我们有理由要求弄个水落石出。否则，表面上说拥护社会主义，实际上却反对社会主义；口头上说拥护共产党，背地里却破坏共产党的领导；表面上一套，背后一套，阳的一套，阴的一套，这样何以取信于人民？何以维护民盟领导的威信？社会主义是我们全国人民和子孙万代幸福所系的大事业，是我们千千万万先进的仁人志士用头颅和鲜血换来的胜利果实。我们决不容许任何右派野心分子加以损害和破坏。因之，我们一定要同右派分子的反党反社会主义思想严格划清界限。在当前严肃的社会主义与反社会主义的政治思想斗争中，我们坚决要求明辨是非，分清立场，决不容许有丝毫含糊。任何避重就轻，阴阳两面的遁辞和手法决不能逃过人民的眼睛。我衰病经年，很少过问民盟的事情。但我爱民盟，我尤爱社会主义，我不能不言，希望民盟同志们指教。　（6月15日）
