Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Bangkok: "Picture News" and "Freedom Communications" quoted sources close to the Thai State Council on June 4th as saying that US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson recently raised some questions to the Thai Ambassador to the United States, Nai Pote Sarasin, that interfered in Thailand's internal affairs.

Robertson's questions were: 1. Why do the Thai people and newspapers attack the Manila Treaty Organization? Why do newspapers supported by Thai leaders, such as "Freedom Communications" and "Eternal News," attack the United States every day? 2. Why did the Thai authorities approve the screening of films from "communist countries," especially China, in Thailand? 3. Why did the Thai authorities allow Thai trade union representatives and art delegations to visit China? Will the government arrest them after they return?

The report said that Nai Pote Sarasin had recently been recalled to the country to discuss with the Thai authorities how to answer the questions raised by Robertson.

"Picture News" published an editorial stating that Robertson's questions were another blatant interference by the United States in Thailand's internal affairs. These questions were raised by a strong country to its dependency. "Picture News" warned: Whenever the United States still treats other countries as its slaves, incidents similar to the Taiwan incident will surely break out in other countries.

"Freedom Communications" pointed out that the United States raised the above questions to Thailand because it feared that the Thai government would change its foreign policy according to the demands of the Thai people.

When Nai Pote Sarasin met with reporters on June 4th, he completely denied the news revealed by the above newspapers. He said that his return to China this time had nothing to do with solving the Thai people's anti-American problems, but he admitted that senior US officials had "questioned each other" on these issues.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Bangkok: The seven Thai trade union representatives who recently visited China were arrested by the Thai police authorities when they flew back to Thailand on June 5th. They will be charged with "participating in communist activities" and "making false reports to the police" because they said they were going to Hong Kong before going abroad.

"Freedom Communications" had already revealed on June 1st that the Thai police authorities' decision to arrest the Thai trade union representatives this time was instigated by the US representative stationed in Bangkok by the Manila Treaty Organization. "Picture News" also published an editorial on June 3rd saying that the Thai police authorities were driven by the "American Emperor" to arrest the Thai visiting Chinese trade union representatives.

　　美国干涉他国内政肆无忌惮
　　罗伯逊向泰国提出横蛮质问
　　泰国当局在美国指使下逮捕访华工会代表
    新华社8日讯  曼谷消息：“图画新闻”和“自由通讯报”6月4日援引接近泰国国务院方面透露的消息说，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊最近曾经向泰国驻美大使乃朴·沙拉信提出了一些干涉泰国内政的质问。
    罗伯逊的问题是：一、泰国人民和报纸为什么要攻击马尼拉条约组织？泰国领导人物支持的报纸如“自由通讯报”和“永恒报”为什么要天天攻击美国？二、泰国当局为什么批准“共产党国家”特别是中国的电影在泰国放映？三、泰国当局为什么准许泰国工会代表和艺术代表团到中国去访问？他们回来以后，政府要不要逮捕他们？
    消息说，乃朴·沙拉信最近已经被召回国，和泰国当局研究如何回答罗伯逊提出的问题。
    “图画新闻”发表社论说，罗伯逊提出的质问，是美国对泰国内政的又一次肆无忌惮的干涉。这些问题是一个强国对它的属国提出的问题。“图画新闻”警告说：什么时候美国仍然把别国当做自己的奴隶，什么时候类似台湾事件的事件一定会在其他国家里爆发。
    “自由通讯报”指出，美国向泰国提出上述问题，是由于害怕泰国政府将按照泰国人民的要求改变它的对外政策。
    乃朴·沙拉信在6月4日接见记者时，全部否认了上述报界透露的消息。他说他这次回国和解决泰国人民反美的问题无关，但是他承认美国的高级官员曾经就这些问题“彼此质问”。
    据新华社7日讯  曼谷消息：最近曾经访问中国的七名泰国工会代表6月5日坐飞机回到泰国时，被泰国警察当局逮捕。他们将被控“参加共产党活动”和“向警方作虚伪报告”，因为他们出国以前说是到香港去的。
    “自由通讯报”早在6月1日就已经透露，泰国警察当局这次决定逮捕泰国工会代表，是受马尼拉条约组织驻曼谷的美国代表指使的。“图画新闻”也在6月3日发表社论说，泰国警察当局是受“美国皇帝”推动而逮捕泰国访华工会代表的。
