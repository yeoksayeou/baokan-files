Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 19th: A grand meeting was held here on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the birth of Georgi Dimitrov, an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement and the great leader of the Bulgarian people. Bulgaranov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Bulgarian people respect and will always remember Dimitrov. He described in detail Dimitrov's revolutionary activities and his outstanding contributions to the Bulgarian people's victory over the monarchy and fascism, the consolidation of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the establishment of a people's democratic state. He particularly pointed out that Dimitrov set a brilliant example of profoundly understanding and skillfully applying Lenin's proposed laws of socialist development in the transition period, which had been tested by Soviet practice, in combination with Bulgaria's conditions. Bulgaranov called on everyone to continue to follow Dimitrov's legacy, to unite more closely around the Bulgarian Communist Party, to work hard to build socialism, to consolidate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, and to strengthen the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
