The Original Version of "Party Rule"
　　Zhao Yuxiang

    On June 2nd, the People's Daily published the speech of Mr. Chu Anping, editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. The central idea of this speech was: In the past few years, a situation of "Party Rule" has formed on this land of China. The Communist Party's use of its members seems to disregard whether they are bad or rotten; as long as they are Party members, they all get official positions, especially important official positions. This kind of "everything under heaven belongs to the king" mentality and practice has made Mr. Chu Anping and some non-Party members indignant and unconvinced. So he said: "Now there are as many as twelve vice premiers in the State Council, none of whom are non-Party members. Is there not a single non-Party member who can sit in this chair? Or is there not a single person who can be cultivated to hold such a position?"

    After this speech was published, many people thought it was wrong and unrealistic, that is to say, this kind of speech was not conducive to socialist construction. But some people think it is correct, reasonable, and seems to be practical.

    Although I belong to the former group of people, I don't intend to say much criticism now, because in the past few days, workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, workers from Beijing, Tianjin and other places, and people from society have already published a lot of critical remarks. These comments are of course correct. Now I just want to extract a few words from a political essay published by Mr. Chu Anping in the old "Observer" magazine ten years ago (before liberation) for everyone to further study and identify whether Mr. Chu's speech on "Party Rule" and "everything under heaven belongs to the king" is correct? Is it realistic? Is it conducive to socialist construction?

    March 8, 1947 (36th year of the Republic of China), "Observer" magazine, Volume 2, Issue 2, page 6. The title of the essay is "The Political Situation in China," the fourth section says: ... "Frankly speaking, today the Communist Party loudly sings its 'democracy,' but it should be known that the Communist Party is essentially an anti-democratic party. In terms of the spirit of rule, the Communist Party and the Fascist Party are no different. Both attempt to force the will of the people through strict organization. In today's political struggle in China, the Communist Party shouts 'democracy,' nothing more than to encourage everyone to rise up against the Kuomintang's 'Party dominance,' but in terms of the true spirit of the Communist Party, what the Communist Party advocates is also 'Party dominance' and definitely not 'democracy.' ...

    "But the Communist Party only has 'enemy' and 'us.' Those who follow them, they can accept; those who do not follow them, they regard as enemies. Everything starts from practical interests, and there is no human feeling or friendship. To support a person, they collectively lift him up; to attack a person, they collectively beat him down. The opposite of fairness is extreme. The Communist Party's extreme style greatly limits the scope of sympathy it gains, that is, reduces the speed at which it achieves success.

    "Honestly speaking, what we are now striving for is freedom. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, this 'freedom' is still a question of 'more' or 'less.' If the Communist Party is in power, this 'freedom' will become a question of 'having' or 'not having.'

    "The year before last, after the British Labour Party won the election, I wrote an article for the Oriental Magazine, concluding that if the British Labour Party's rule is successful, it will make the world understand that to implement socialism, one does not necessarily have to follow the Moscow route. The British Labour Party promotes socialist policies on the one hand, but at the same time still recognizes the people's freedom of will. If the Communist Party can revise its policies and relax its standards in political life, it will further increase its hope of achieving success."

    We know that Mr. Chu Anping wrote this political essay advising the Communist Party to modify its policies, relax its standards, and take the path of the British Labour Party in March 1947. But two years later, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the people across the country, had eliminated eight million Kuomintang reactionary troops on the Chinese mainland. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, the Chinese people stood up, and for eight years the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country in carrying out great socialist construction and socialist transformation, until today. Let us recall that if the Communist Party had accepted Mr. Chu Anping's advice and suggestions at that time, then the "success" and "speed" and "scope of sympathy" of our revolutionary cause would truly have had no "hope." Isn't this an obvious and universally understood truth?

    Today—1957, the last year of the motherland's Five-Year Plan, Mr. Chu Anping is still criticizing the Communist Party for engaging in "Party Rule," but what exactly does Mr. Chu want to say in his heart? What else does he want to advise and suggest to the Communist Party? We still don't know!

　　“党天下”的原版
　　赵玉祥
    6月2日人民日报发表了光明日报总编辑储安平先生在中共中央统战部召开的各民主党派座谈会上的发言。这个发言的中心意思是：几年来，在中国这块土地上，已形成了“党天下”的局面，共产党对他们的党员的使用似乎有不管坏的臭的只要是党员，就一律有官当，特别是当的还是主官。这种“莫非王土”的思想和做法很使储安平先生及一些党外人士愤慨和不服。——所以说：“现在国务院的副总理有十二位之多，其中没有一个非党人士，是不是非党人士中没有一人可以坐此交椅？或者没有一个人可以被培植来担任这样的职务？”
    这个发言发表之后，有不少人认为是错误的，不现实的，也就是说这种言论是不利于社会主义建设的。但也有一些人认为是正确的，是有道理的，也似乎是实际的。
    我虽然是属于前者认识的人，但我现在不打算多说批评的话，因为这几天石景山钢铁厂工人，北京、天津等地的工人和社会上的人民都已经发表了不少的批评言论。这些评论当然是正确的。现在我只想把十年前（解放前）储安平先生在旧“观察”杂志上发表的一篇政治专论其中一段的数言摘出来供大家进一步研究鉴别储先生关于“党天下”和“莫非王土”的发言是否正确？是否现实？是否有利于社会主义建设？
    1947年（中华民国36年）3月8日，“观察”杂志第二卷第二期第六页。专论题目为“中国的政局”第四节中道：……“坦而言之，今日共产党大唱其‘民主’，要知共产党在基本精神上，实在是一个反民主的政党。就统治精神上说，共产党和法西斯党本无任何区别，两者都企图透过严厉的组织以强制人民的意志。在今日中国的政争中，共产党高喊‘民主’，无非要鼓励大家起来反对国民党的‘党主’，但就共产党的真精神言，共产党所主张的也是‘党主’而决非‘民主’。……
    “但是共产党的对人只有‘敌’‘我’，跟他们跑的，他们可以承纳，不跟他们跑的，他们一律敌视。一切都以实际利害为出发，不存任何人情与友谊。要捧一个人，集体地捧起他来，要攻击一个人，集体地把他打了下去。公平的反面就是极端，共产党的极端作风，实在大大地限制了他获得同情的范围，亦即减少他获得成功的速度。
    “老实说，我们现在争取自由，在国民党统治下，这个‘自由’还是个‘多’‘少’的问题，假如共产党执政了，这个‘自由’就变成了一个‘有’‘无’的问题了。
    “前年英国工党竞选胜利以后，我替东方杂志写过一篇文章，结论说：假如英国工党执政成功，则使世人明白，实行社会主义不一定要走莫斯科的路线。英国工党一方面推行社会主义政策，但同时仍承认人民的意志自由。假如共产党能在政治生活方面，修正其政策，放宽其尺度，则将更能增加他们获得成功的希望。”
    我们知道，储安平先生写这篇政论劝告共产党修改政策，放宽尺度，走英国工党的道路，是1947年3月，但是事过二年后中国人民解放军在共产党的领导下、在全国人民的支持下已经在中国大陆上消灭了八百万国民党反动军队。1949年10月1日中华人民共和国成立了，中国人民站起来了，八年来中国共产党领导全国人民进行伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，直到今天。我们回忆一下，如果共产党当时接受了储安平先生的劝告和建议的话，那末我国革命事业的“成功”与“速度”“同情范围”就将真是没有“希望”的了。这岂不是显而易见，人人都懂得的道理吗？
    今天——1957年，祖国五年计划最后一年，储安平先生仍在批评共产党搞“党天下”，但是究竟储先生心里还要说的话是什么？还要向共产党劝告、建议些什么？我们还不得知哩！
