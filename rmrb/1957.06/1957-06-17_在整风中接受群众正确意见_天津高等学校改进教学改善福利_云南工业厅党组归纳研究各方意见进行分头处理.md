Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th. Communist Party organizations in Tianjin's universities and colleges listened to and accepted correct opinions from the masses during the rectification movement, adopting measures to improve while rectifying.

The Nankai University Party Committee and administration, after studying opinions raised by teachers and students, decided that the examination system would no longer adopt the practice of "repeating a grade for failing one course." Instead, students will advance to the next grade and retake the failed course. Regarding foreign language learning, they also improved on the past shortcomings of uniform requirements and excessively rigid regulations. It was decided that students can now choose to study either Russian or English, based on their specific conditions and the needs of their major, under the guidance of the department head. Students in the Chinese and History departments can also choose to study Japanese. In addition, it was decided to temporarily suspend the excellent student system, etc. Based on the opinions of teachers and students, they also decided to transfer responsibility for assistant promotion, graduate allocation, and retaining assistant teachers from the Personnel Department to the respective departments. Improvements were also made regarding student self-study spaces, the hygiene of the Hui Muslim canteen, and the allocation of housing. Some Party member leaders in this school also consciously gave up unreasonable benefits such as receiving subsidies. Professors and leaders who were party members, such as Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs Teng Weizao, also requested a reduction in their rank.

In order to achieve reasonable solutions to some major problems, six universities and colleges, including Tianjin University, established special working groups responsible for teaching, scientific research, living welfare, and post-"anti-rightist" work. These groups are responsible for studying the issues raised by teachers and students and proposing solutions, gradually resolving them. The Tianjin Medical College Party Committee has initially compiled more than thirty issues to be studied and resolved.

Currently, the vast majority of teachers and students in various schools are actively providing opinions to help the Party in its rectification efforts. At the same time, they have refuted some anti-socialist remarks inside and outside the school. Teachers and students from schools such as Tianjin University and Tianjin Normal College have spontaneously organized forums to criticize absurd anti-socialist remarks.

People's Daily, Kunming, 15th. The Party Leadership Group of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry carefully studied more than one hundred and twenty opinions, large and small, put forward by non-Party members, classified them into five categories, and handled them separately, thus improving their work. In order to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, the Party Leadership Group instructed Party members and cadres to take the initiative to make friends with non-Party comrades. As a result of the Party members and cadres in the twelve sections of the department having heart-to-heart talks with more than twenty non-Party technical personnel, mutual suspicion disappeared. Zou Guiyan, the person in charge of the Planning Section and Deputy Chief Engineer, had previously lost his temper with Guo Zhu, a non-Party engineer, causing the Guo engineer to be depressed for a long time. This time, Zou Guiyan took the initiative to admit his mistake to him, and Guo engineer was very moved, and their relationship improved. He Yizhong, the person in charge of the Technical Office, took the initiative to find engineering and technical personnel who usually had opinions about him to talk heart-to-heart, humbly listening to their criticisms of him and making a self-criticism, expressing his willingness to meet with them regularly for ideological exchanges.

At the same time, Party and non-Party comrades in the Department of Industry jointly re-examined the confidentiality system of the Department of Industry. After research, the procedures for technical personnel to borrow technical data were simplified, and relevant technical personnel were also invited to participate in discussions on important meetings and the formulation of plans and programs.

In addition, they also began to investigate the existing staff dormitories, repairing what should be repaired, and explaining the situation to cadres who could not yet be provided with housing. There are also some issues related to the personnel system, wages, grading, as well as the system between the local and central governments, and the guidelines and policies for local industry, which require further study due to the wide range of issues involved.

　　云南工业厅党组归纳研究各方意见进行分头处理
    新华社天津15日电　天津市各高等学校的中共组织在整风运动中听取和接受了群众正确的意见，采取了边整风边改进的措施。
    南开大学党委和行政根据师生提出的意见，经过研究决定在考试制度中今后不再采用“一门课不及格就留级”的办法，而采取升级后加修不及格的课程的办法。在学习外文方面也改进了过去要求一律、规定太死的缺点，决定今后学习可根据学生的具体条件和专业性质的需要，在系主任的指导下，在俄语或英语中选修一门外语，中文和历史两系还可选修日语。另外还决定暂不推行优秀生制度等。根据教师和学生们提出的意见，还决定把过去由人事处掌握的助教升级、毕业生分配、留助教等工作，交给各系负责。有关学生自修场所、回民食堂卫生条件、房舍分配等问题也作了改进。这个学校的一些党员领导干部还自觉地放弃领补助费等不合理的待遇，副教务长滕维藻等党员教授和领导干部还要求降低级别。
    天津大学等六所高等学校为了使一些重大问题获得合理解决，都分别成立了教学、科学研究、生活福利、“肃反”善后工作等专门工作组，负责研究师生们提出的问题和提出解决问题的方案，逐步进行解决。天津医学院党委已初步整理出三十多个问题准备加以研究解决。
    目前，各学校的绝大多数的教师和学生一方面积极地提出意见，帮助党整风；同时对校内外的一些反社会主义的言论进行了批驳，天津大学、天津师范学院等学校的教师和学生都自动组织了座谈会来批驳荒谬的反社会主义言论。
    本报昆明15日电　云南省工业厅党组认真研究了党外人士提出的大小一百二十多条意见，把意见归纳为五类，分头处理，改进了工作。为了密切党群关系，党组向党员干部提出要主动的和非党同志交朋友。厅内十二个科室的党员干部找了二十多个非党技术人员谈心的结果，彼此之间的猜疑消失了。计划科负责人兼副总工程师邹规岩曾对非党工程师郭柱发过脾气，致使郭工程师长期苦闷。此次邹规岩主动找他承认了错误，郭工程师很感动，关系有了好转。技术室负责人何义忠主动的把平时对他有意见的工程技术人员找到一起谈心，虚心的听取他们对自己的批评，并作了自我检讨，表示愿意同他们经常思想见面。
    在此同时，工业厅的党和非党同志在一起重新研究了工业厅的保密制度。经过研究后，简化了技术人员借阅技术资料的手续，重要的会议和制定计划、规划等，也吸收有关的技术人员参加讨论。
    此外，他们还把现有的职工宿舍开始作了调查，该修的就修，对暂时还不能解决房子的干部也进行了解释。还有一些有关人事制度、工资、评级以及地方同中央的体制问题，地方工业的方针政策等问题，因涉及面较广，尚需进一步研究。
