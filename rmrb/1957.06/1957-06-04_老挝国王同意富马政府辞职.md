Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 3rd - Vientiane, June 2nd dispatch: The King of Laos has agreed to the resignation of the government led by Prince Souvanna Phouma. Due to the King's indisposition, the Crown Prince will consult on the formation of a new cabinet.

Phouma submitted his resignation on May 30th after the National Assembly rejected the government's motion to continue negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. Since then, the Crown Prince has held frequent contacts with the National Assembly and leaders of various political parties to discuss the formation of a new cabinet.

According to Agence France-Presse, the National Assembly's rejection of the government's motion shows that members oppose Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith. According to sources close to the Prime Minister's office, the National Assembly agrees with the overall political line defined by Phouma in his speech to the National Assembly.

At the same time, most members are deeply determined to support the continuation of negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units and approve the implementation of the agreements signed by both sides. However, they do not agree that the government should continue negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units while maintaining its current members.

In addition, the National Assembly has not reached a consensus on the time limit for the agreement between the two sides and how it should be implemented, especially regarding disagreements over the guarantees required from the Pathet Lao Fighting Units.

    老挝国王同意富马政府辞职
    新华社河内3日电　万象6月2日消息：老挝国王已经同意富马亲王领导的政府辞职。由于国王身体不适，由王太子来磋商关于组织新内阁的事情。
    富马是在国民议会否决了政府关于继续同寮国战斗部队进行谈判的动议之后在5月30日提出辞职的。在这以后，王太子已经同国会和各政党领袖进行了频繁的接触，讨论成立新内阁问题。
    据法新社透露，国民议会对政府动议的否决说明议员反对副首相卡代·萨索里特。据接近首相府的人士说，国民议会是同意富马在国民议会的演说中所确定的总政治路线的。
    同时，大多数议员都深具决心支持继续同寮国战斗部队谈判和赞成开始执行双方签订的协定。但是，他们不同意政府在保持目前成员情况下继续同寮国战斗部队进行谈判。
    此外，国民议会对于双方的协定应当以什么时间为期限和应当以什么方式执行的问题没有取得一致的意见，特别是关于向寮国战斗部队要求提供的保证方面意见不一致。
