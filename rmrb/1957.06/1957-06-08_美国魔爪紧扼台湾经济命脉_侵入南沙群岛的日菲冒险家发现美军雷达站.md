Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The United States is further intensifying its economic control and plunder of Taiwan through "U.S. Aid."

    According to Taiwan newspapers, the United States' economic power in Taiwan is increasing daily. All major financial and economic measures of the Chiang Kai-shek group must be approved by the U.S. International Cooperation Administration's Taiwan branch, which is in charge of economic aid. Sources say that although Taiwan's "Economic Stabilization Committee" and "U.S. Aid Utilization Committee" are nominally organizations under the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Executive Yuan," U.S. representatives must participate in the meetings of these two committees and each of their subgroups, and all economic decisions must follow the opinions of these Americans. The number of official U.S. economic "advisors" stationed in Taiwan has increased from 117 in 1954 to approximately 300 at present. At the same time, there are also fourteen so-called "private delegations" from the United States in Taiwan, monopolizing Taiwan's foreign trade and the production of many factories and mines. Therefore, Taiwanese social figures call these American representatives a group of "privileged profiteers."

    The United States' capital power in Taiwan is constantly expanding. From 1951 to the 1957 fiscal year, the United States injected approximately 300 million U.S. dollars into Taiwan's industrial sector through forms such as "industrial construction aid." The United States not only controls Taiwan's bureaucratic capital enterprises but also manipulates more than 300 private factories and agricultural production under the guise of "loans." According to newspaper reports, the once-famous Yangzi Timber Company in Taiwan is now being taken over by the U.S. company Datu Lin Company for 750,000 U.S. dollars, and the company will be completely operated by Americans in the future. Recently, the United States also allocated 3 million U.S. dollars to "assist" in building a coking coal plant in Taiwan. All machine design, engineering construction, product sales, and business personnel training are contracted by the U.S. "Corrun Carbonization and Machinery Company." Other examples include the Xinying Yeast Factory and the Changhua Bagasse Factory, which are all opening up sources of wealth for American capitalists under the guise of "U.S. Aid" or "loans." American capital accounts for 60% of Taiwan's sugar and salt industries. Taiwan's electricity, transportation, machinery manufacturing, man-made fibers, chemical fertilizers, papermaking, food, and more than twenty other major enterprises have all been infiltrated and controlled by American capital. Recently, the United States has sent a large number of experts and engineers to Taiwan and is planning to comprehensively develop and plunder Taiwan's underground resources. Newspaper reports say that Taiwan has become "a piece of fat meat" in the mouths of American tycoons.

    Taiwan is now suffering from a "U.S. Aid" disaster. Not long ago, the Shihmen Reservoir and highway construction projects in Taiwan needed more than 10,000 tons of steel bars and other building materials, but because the project received "U.S. Aid," the U.S. economic advisor stationed in Taiwan forced them to buy from the United States at a high price. Taiwan's machinery industry personnel repeatedly called for purchases to be made in Taiwan, but they were rejected. Therefore, the steel bars and other building materials produced in Taiwan could not be sold in Taiwan and were forced to be sold abroad at reduced prices.

    The U.S. Westinghouse Electric Company controls Taiwan's most important 34 power plants. Since 1954, it has forced the Taiwan Power Company to raise electricity prices three times. These three electricity price increases have added a burden of more than 230 million New Taiwan Dollars per year to the people of Taiwan, and hundreds of electricity users are often cut off from power by the power company because they cannot afford to pay their electricity bills.

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Manila News: Yoshio Otake, the head of a "survey team" recently dispatched by Tokyo's Toyo Trading Company to China's Nansha Islands without authorization, told reporters at a press conference held in Manila yesterday that members of this "survey team" encountered a U.S. Air Force unit that had established a radar station on an island in the archipelago when they conducted a survey of the Nansha Islands with Filipino Thomas Cloma. Otake said that he and Cloma both recognized the number of this U.S. Air Force unit.

    Filipino lawyer and businessman Thomas Cloma had unauthorizedly sent a survey team to the Nansha Islands in March 1956, named the archipelago "Freedomland," and demanded that it be incorporated into the Philippine territory.

    After Cloma and the Toyo Trading Company's "survey team" conducted a survey of the Nansha Islands, both parties publicly announced at a press conference held on the 6th that they had reached an agreement on the exploitation of phosphate mines, fish products, and seabird guano on the archipelago. Otake said at the meeting that his "survey team" had discovered abundant mineral deposits on three islands in the Nansha Islands.

### 美国魔爪紧扼台湾经济命脉  侵入南沙群岛的日菲冒险家发现美军雷达站

    美国魔爪紧扼台湾经济命脉
    侵入南沙群岛的日菲冒险家发现美军雷达站
    据新华社7日讯　美国通过“美援”进一步加紧对台湾的经济控制和掠夺。
    据台湾报纸透露，美国在台湾的经济权力日益加强。蒋介石集团的一切重大财政经济措施，都要由主持经援的美国国际合作总署台湾分署批准。消息说，台湾的“经济安定委员会”、“美援运用委员会”，名义上虽然是蒋介石集团“行政院”属下的机构，但这两个委员会和它的每一小组或分组开会，都必须有美国代表参加，并且经济上的一切决定要听从这些美国人的意见。美国正式派在台湾的经济“顾问”，从1954年一百一十七人到目前已增加到约三百多人。同时，美国在台湾还有十四个所谓“私人代表团”，垄断了台湾的对外贸易和许多工厂矿山企业的生产。因此，台湾社会人士称这些美国代表为一群“有特权的奸商”。
    美国在台湾的资本势力不断扩大。从1951年到1957年度，美国通过“工建援助”等形式侵入台湾工业部门的资金约三亿多美元。美国不但控制了台湾官僚资本企业，而且以“贷款”的名义，操纵了三百多家民营工厂和农业生产。据报纸消息，原台湾驰名的扬子木材公司，现在正被美商达杜林公司以七十五万美元接管，以后该公司将完全由美国人经营。最近，美国还拨款三百万美元在台湾“协助”兴建焦煤厂，一切机器设计、工程建筑、产品销售、业务人员的训练，全由美国“寇伦炭化与机器公司”包办。其他新营酵母工厂、彰化蔗板工厂都是类似的以“美援”或“贷款”名义，替美国资本家开辟财源。在台湾沙糖和制盐工业中，美国资本各占60％。台湾的电力、交通运输、机器制造、人造纤维、化学肥料、造纸、食品等二十多项主要企业，无一不被美国资本所渗透和控制。最近，美国又派了大批专家和工程人员到台湾，正计划全面地开发和掠夺台湾地下资源。报纸消息说，台湾已成了美国大亨口下的“一块肥肉”。
    台湾现在“美援”成灾。不久前，台湾修建石门水库和公路的工程，需要一万多吨钢筋等建筑材料，但是因为这个工程接受了“美援”，美国驻台湾经济顾问就强迫要以高价向美国去买。台湾机器工业界人士曾经一再呼吁要在台湾购买，但是被拒绝了。因此台湾生产的钢筋等建筑材料在台湾卖不出去，被迫杀价外销。
    美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司控制了台湾最主要的三十四个发电厂，从1954年以来，强迫台湾电力公司三次提高电费。这三次电力加价，共给台湾人民每年增加了二亿三千多万元伪台币的负担，并且经常有成百家的电灯用户，因为缴不起电费，被电力公司切断电源，停止供电。
    据新华社7日讯　马尼拉消息：东京东洋贸易公司最近擅自派往中国领土南沙群岛的一个“勘查团”的负责人小竹芳雄，昨天在马尼拉举行的记者招待会上对记者说，这个“勘查团”的成员同菲律宾人托马斯·克洛马在南沙群岛进行勘查时，曾经遇见在这个群岛的一个岛上设立了雷达站的一个美国空军单位。小竹说，他同克洛马都认出了这个美国空军单位的番号。
    菲律宾律师兼商人托马斯·克洛马曾经擅自在1956年3月派了勘查队到南沙群岛进行勘察，命名这个群岛为“自由岛”，并且要求把它并入菲律宾版图。
    克洛马同东京东洋贸易公司的这个“勘查团”到南沙群岛进行勘查以后，双方在6日举行的记者招待会上竟然公开宣布，他们已经就开采这个群岛上的磷矿、鱼产和海鸟粪的问题达成了协议。小竹在会上说，他的“勘查团”在南沙群岛的三个岛上发现了丰富的矿藏。
