　　Challenging the Leading Position of the Working Class is Bound to Fail
　　Prominent Trade Union Workers Denounce the Anti-Communist Clamor of Rightists
    This Newspaper reports: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a symposium on the 14th of June attended by some worker-origin trade union cadres and technicians from various industrial trade unions. They used facts based on their personal experiences to refute the anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies of the rightists.
    Sun Yuhui, Vice Chairman of the China Coal Miners' Union, said: Some people say that socialism is not good. Is it really not good? I grew up in a coal mine, so let's look at it from the perspective of the coal mine. Before liberation, the highest annual coal production in China (1942) was 61.88 million tons, but in 1956 it reached over 100 million tons. The average wage of coal miners in 1952 was over 56 yuan, and in 1956 it was over 70 yuan. As for employee housing, it was 2.73 million square meters in 1952 and 7.8 million square meters in 1956. Before liberation, gas explosions were the biggest threat to coal miners. In 1943, a single gas explosion in Benxi killed 1,600 people. After liberation, over 99% of state-owned coal mines have mechanized ventilation equipment, which has basically stopped gas explosions. Are these not manifestations of the superiority of socialism?
    Huang Minwei, Chairman of the China Electrical Workers' Union, said: We urge rightists to go to factories and look at the facts, instead of talking nonsense. What are the facts? Take China's electric power industry as an example. In the year from May 21, 1956, to May 20, 1957, the national electric power industry produced a total of 17.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours compared with the total power generation in 1952, equivalent to three times the highest annual output before liberation (1941). Can it be said that this is not the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party? The average wage of electrical workers was about 37 yuan in 1949, and by 1956 it had increased to more than 75 yuan, a greater increase than before liberation. Can this be described as a decline in the living standards of workers?!
    Tang Guifen, Vice Chairman of the China Textile Workers' Union, said: I want to ask, what is the basis for Chu Anping's "Party's World"? In the textile industry system, from the central to the grassroots factories and mines, there are many non-Party people participating in leadership work. Jiang Guangnai, the Minister of Textile Industry, is not a Party member, and many factory directors are not Party members either. She said that Li Kangnian's statement that extending fixed interest for twenty years is for socialism represents the views of some capitalists and aims to hold back socialism. The fixed interest of joint state-private enterprises is entirely created by the hard work of workers. What is this if not exploitation? Zhang Naiqi, however, insists that it is unearned income. What they are saying is trying to make capitalism never disappear. We workers will not be fooled by them.
    Zang Yanhu, Deputy Director of the Labor Protection Department of the China Textile Workers' Union, said: I am a fitter by origin. Ge Peiqi's statements that "If the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse" and "Even without the leadership of the Communist Party, no one will sell out the country" are completely absurd. Take Qingdao as an example. Qingdao was once ruled by the Germans and Japanese. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang brought American soldiers to Qingdao. The best scenic area along the coast in Qingdao became a barracks for American soldiers, and the airport also became American. American soldiers roamed the streets all day long, and many people were beaten to death by American soldiers. In the parks and even on the roads, women were raped. But the Kuomintang government dared not even ask about it. When someone was beaten to death, his family wanted to sue, but the police station said, "They gave you money, what are you still suing for?" The Chinese government speaking for the Americans, isn't that selling out the country? From the Qing Dynasty government to the Beiyang warlord government and the Kuomintang government, they signed countless unequal treaties that sold out the country. The only government that did not sell out the country is the People's Republic of China government under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only those who want to restore the rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China hope that the Communist Party will collapse. We, the Chinese people who do not want to be slaves, will resolutely follow the Communist Party.
    Wang Zhenmin, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Commerce Union, said: I used to be a clerk in a department store in Harbin and personally experienced the exploitation of us by the capitalists. At that time, there was no job security at all. The clerks all knew that every year on the sixteenth day of the first month, everyone was worried. If the capitalist did not like a clerk, he would let you go as soon as you finished eating the yuanxiao (sweet dumplings). Now the clerks in our state-owned stores have become the masters of the enterprise, and many clerks have also become cadres. They are guaranteed for life, old age, illness, and death. They are no longer threatened by unemployment. Wu Guilan from Harbin became a manager and attended the World Women Workers' Conference. Without the Communist Party, where would we clerks be today?
    Wang Jiachong, Director of the Production Department of the China First Machine Union, said: In the few years since liberation, the Party and the government have promoted many conscious and capable people from our workers' ranks to serve as foremen, workshop directors, section chiefs, and factory directors. They have also been elected as people's representatives and members of the People's Government. A large number of workers have been sent to various schools to improve their cultural and technical levels, and many have become college students. Many journalists and painters of worker origin have also emerged. Moreover, a group of workers has been sent to the military, public security, and judicial organs as backbone personnel. This shows that workers have indeed become the masters of the country, and workers must be cultivated to participate in the political and economic management of the country. At the same time, the Party has also cultivated many intellectuals who are loyal to the proletarian cause, giving full play to their abilities and promoting them to leadership positions at all levels. However, Yang Yuqing insisted that in the past eight years, the Party has been cultivating people to "carry the sedan chair." He wants the senior leading cadres to "get off the sedan chair" and "step down." This is a slander against our vast number of worker cadres and all progressive people, and a challenge to the leading position of the working class. Their attempts are destined to be shamefully defeated.
    Li Yong, the famous driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive and Director of the Financial Audit Committee of the China Railway Union, refuted the rightists' nonsense that the Communist Party has become divorced from the people. He said: In 1931-1932, Harbin suffered a flood, and many people drowned. Those who were not drowned could not buy food. Last year, the water level in Harbin exceeded the level of 1931 by three or four meters, but no one was drowned. Isn't this the achievement of the Communist Party's leadership?
    Li Fenglian, a labor model working at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said with tears in her eyes: My mother gave birth to sixteen children, but only five survived. The rest all starved to death. When I was eight years old, because I owed the landlord one catty of meat, I couldn't pay it off for three years. In the end, I was used as payment for the debt. I was beaten by the landlord in his house, ate food with maggots, and drank the landlord's urine. To this day, I still have scars on my face. My mother was also forced to death by the landlord, and my whole family was scattered. After liberation, I escaped from the tiger's den and changed from a peasant to a worker, and the worker became a cadre. I personally experienced that without the Communist Party, there would be no life today.

### 向工人阶级领导地位挑战一定要失败  著名工会工作人员痛斥右派分子的反共叫嚣

　　向工人阶级领导地位挑战一定要失败
　　著名工会工作人员痛斥右派分子的反共叫嚣
    本报讯　中华全国总工会14日召开了各产业工会一部分工人出身的工会干部和技术人员座谈会。他们用亲身体验的事实驳斥了右派分子的反共、反社会主义的谬论。
    中国煤矿工会副主席孙玉惠说：有人说社会主义不好，到底好不好呢？我是从小就生长在煤矿上的，咱们就从煤矿上来看看。解放以前，中国煤矿最高年产量（1942）是六千一百八十八万吨，1956年就达到了一亿多吨。1952年煤矿工人平均工资是五十六元多，1956年是七十元多，职工住宅，1952年是二百七十三万平方公尺，1956年是七百八十万平方公尺。解放以前，瓦斯爆炸对煤矿工人是最大的威胁，1943年本溪一次瓦斯爆炸就死了一千六百人。解放以后，在国营煤矿中，有机械化通风设备的已达到99％以上，基本上制止了瓦斯的爆炸。这些，难道不是社会主义优越性的表现吗？
    中国电业工会主席黄民伟说：我们要求右派分子到工厂里去看一看事实，不要胡说八道。事实是怎么样呢？就拿中国电力工业来说吧，从1956年5月21日到1957年5月20日的一年中，全国电力工业总计生产了一百七十八亿度电力，比1952年全年发电量增加了一百多亿度，相当于解放前最高年（1941年）产量的三倍。难道说这不是共产党正确领导的结果吗？电业工人的平均工资在1949年约三十七元多，到1956年已提高到七十五元多，比解放前提高的更多了。这难道可以说成是工人生活水平降低了吗？！
    中国纺织工会副主席汤桂芬说：我要问储安平的“党天下”根据是什么？纺织工业系统从中央直到基层厂矿，都有很多非党人士参加领导工作。纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐就不是党员，很多厂长也不是党员。她说，李康年说定息延长二十年是为了社会主义，这是代表了一部分资本家说话的，是想拖社会主义的后腿。公私合营企业的定息完全是工人辛勤劳动创造的，这不是剥削是什么？章乃器却偏说它是不劳而获的收入。他们这样说是想让资本主义永远不要消灭，我们工人可不会上他们的当。
    中国纺织工会劳动保护部副部长臧衍祜说：我是钳工出身。葛佩琦说的“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”，是完全荒谬的。就拿青岛来说，青岛曾受过德国、日本人的统治；日本投降以后，国民党又把美国兵领到青岛。青岛最好的风景区前海沿成了美国兵兵营，飞机场也成了美国的。美国兵成天在街上横冲直撞，有好多人被美国兵打死。在公园里，甚至马路上也有妇女被强奸。可是国民党政府看到这些，连问也不敢问。有个人被打死了，他的家属要上告，派出所却说，人家给了你钱，你还告什么？中国人的政府给美国人说话，不是卖国是什么？从满清政府到北洋军阀政府、国民党政府，订了不知多少卖国的不平等条约。唯一不卖国的是共产党领导下的中华人民共和国政府。只有那些要恢复帝国主义及其走狗在中国统治的人，才希望共产党亡。我们不愿做亡国奴的中国人民，要坚决跟着共产党走。
    中国商业工会业务部副部长王振民说：我过去是哈尔滨市一个百货商店里的店员，亲身体验到资本家对我们的剥削。那时候，职业完全没有保障，店员们都知道，每年到了正月十六，大家都提心吊胆，如果资本家看着那个店员不顺眼，吃了元宵就让你滚蛋。现在我们国营商店的店员已成了企业的主人，不少的店员还当了干部，生老病死都有了保障。再不受失业的威胁了。哈尔滨吴桂兰当了经理并出席了世界女工会议。没有共产党，我们店员那里能有今天？
    中国第一机械工会生产部部长王家宠说：解放几年以来，党和政府从我们工人队伍中提拔了许多有觉悟有能力的人去担任工段长、车间主任、科长、厂长，还被选举为人大代表、人民政府委员，大批工人被送到各种学校去提高文化和技术水平，不少人当了大学生，也出现了不少工人出身的记者、画家。而且输送了一批工人到部队和公安、司法机关去作为骨干，这正说明了工人确实成为国家的主人了，工人要被培养起来参加国家政治和经济的管理。同时党也培养了许多忠于无产阶级事业的知识分子，充分发挥他们的能力，把他们提拔到各级领导岗位上去。可是杨玉清偏偏说，八年来培养的是抬轿子的人。要上级领导干部“下轿”“下台”。这是对我们广大工人干部和一切进步人士的污蔑，是向工人阶级的领导地位挑战。他们的企图注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    著名的毛泽东号机车司机、中国铁路工会经费审查委员会主任李永驳斥右派分子所谓共产党已脱离了人民的鬼话。他说：1931—1932年哈尔滨闹水灾，淹死了很多人，没被淹死的人，买不到粮食吃。去年哈尔滨的水位超过1931年三、四公尺高，但没有一个人被淹死，难道这不是共产党领导的成绩么？
    在全国总工会工作的劳动模范李凤莲咽吞着眼泪说：我母亲生了十六个孩子，活着的只有五个，其余的都饿死了。我八岁时，因为欠地主一斤肉钱，三年没有还清，最后拿我顶了账。我在地主家里挨过地主的毒打，吃过生蛆的饭，喝过地主的尿，到今天脸上还有伤疤。母亲也被地主逼死，全家离散。解放后，我逃出了虎穴，由农民变成了工人，工人变成了干部。我亲身体验没有共产党就没有今天的生活。
