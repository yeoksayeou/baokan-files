Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, June 27th: China's first plant for flotation of ferrous metal ore - the Anshan Iron and Steel Flotation Workshop, began production today.

　　The entire production process of the flotation workshop is automated. Ore rises gradually from a storage tank more than 40 meters deep along fourteen conveyor belts. After processes such as ball milling, classification, and flotation, iron ore with an iron content of about 30% is transformed into concentrate with an iron content of 58%. After being sintered into artificial rich ore by a sintering machine, it becomes the raw material for ironmaking.

　　The adoption of the flotation method can directly select the most abundant hematite ore around Anshan. It not only reduces a reduction process compared to the previously used magnetic separation but can also process fine ore that cannot be processed by reduction furnaces.

　　After the flotation workshop goes into production, it will also undertake the role of a large industrial laboratory. University professors, scientific researchers, and Anshan Iron and Steel's technical personnel will successively conduct flotation experiments here using chemical agents such as soybean oil fatty acids, sulfated soap, and rice bran oil, preparing to research a low-cost and widely available flotation agent for future large-scale ferrous metal flotation plants.

### 我国第一个浮选黑色金属矿的工厂  鞍钢浮选车间开始生产

　　我国第一个浮选黑色金属矿的工厂
    鞍钢浮选车间开始生产
    新华社鞍山27日电　我国第一个浮选黑色金属矿的工厂——鞍钢浮选车间今天开始生产。
    浮选车间的生产过程全部是自动化的。矿石从离地面四十多公尺深的贮矿槽里沿着十四条运输皮带逐渐上升，经过球磨、分级、浮选等过程，使含铁成分30％左右的铁矿石变成含铁量58％的精矿；再经过烧结机烧结成人造富矿，就成为炼铁的原料了。
    采用浮选的方法，可以直接选鞍山四周蕴藏量最丰富的赤铁矿，不仅比过去采用的磁选减少一道还原过程，而且还可以处理还原炉不能处理的粉矿。
    浮选车间投入生产以后，还将负担一个大工业试验室的作用。大学教授、科学研究人员和鞍钢的技术人员，将陆续在这里用豆油脂肪酸、硫酸化皂、米糠油等化学药剂进行浮选试验，准备为将来规模巨大的黑色金属浮选厂研究出一种成本低、来源广的浮选药剂。
