This newspaper's Xining dispatch on the 28th: Field workers working in the Qaidam Basin and those who have worked there refute the anti-socialist and anti-Communist Party leadership statements of Zhang Bojun and others.

Guo Wanyou, the driver who first drove a car from Xining to Mangya in March 1955, said, "Anyone who enters the basin knows there are great difficulties: hundreds of miles of Gobi Desert, endless expanses of cracked mud flats, herds of wild animals, and overwhelming sandstorms. Faced with these difficulties, the reactionary rulers knew there were abundant mineral resources inside, but they were too scared to enter. Ma Bufang sent people to get a little borax nearby and then came back. Only the Communist Party has such great courage. For the benefit of the people, they are not afraid of any difficulties and decided to develop this place." Chen Boxian, one of the first workers to enter the basin in 1955, said: "The right-wingers say, 'We don't need the leadership of the Communist Party.' I want to ask: Who do you want to lead us? I am not a Communist Party member, but the facts tell me that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the country's construction develop by leaps and bounds. Take the basin as an example: In early 1955, it took us nine days to get from Xining to Golmud. In the second half of the year, it was shortened to five days. Last year, it was shortened to three days, and now it only takes two days. In such a sparsely populated area, in less than three years, the number of workers in the basin has increased to tens of thousands. Good news of the discovery of oil-bearing structures and reports of mineral discoveries keep coming. New towns have sprung up in several places, and well towers have been erected in many places. Such amazing changes have taken place! Without the Communist Party, roads in the Qaidam Basin could not even be built. How many people would freeze to death or starve to death if they went in! It is true that some Party members have problems, but that is individual. The vast majority of Party members are working hard for the people, demonstrating the spirit of enduring hardship before others. Many Party member young cadres in the basin are running around on construction sites. Wherever there are difficulties, they appear. Could some of the 'officials' in the old society do that?" Li Shengfen, a member of the women's geological team that overfulfilled its exploration tasks in Lenghu and Delingha last year, said: "Everyone knows that the working conditions in the Qaidam Basin are very difficult. Several female comrades in our team came here not long after leaving school. Every day, we started work at seven in the morning, running several kilometers, climbing mountains and crossing ditches, and we were busy until after ten at night before returning. On the Gobi Desert, we were sometimes so thirsty that our throats hurt and we didn't dare to speak, so tired that we couldn't walk and shouted 'one, two' to move forward. Sometimes we lost our way and wandered around in the barren mountains and wilderness. The wind blew away the tents, and we squatted on the ground to rest. But we never complained, and instead, we were filled with pride in our profession. This is all thanks to the Party's education, which encourages us and tells us to do this. Without the Party, all this would be hard to imagine. The right-wingers oppose the Party's leadership. I firmly support the Party's leadership."

### 戈壁上出现了城镇　盆地里竖立起井  塔柴达木发生惊天动地的变化

　　戈壁上出现了城镇　盆地里竖立起井
    塔柴达木发生惊天动地的变化
    本报西宁28日电　正在柴达木盆地工作和曾在盆地里工作过的野外工作人员驳斥章伯钧等人的反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的言论。
    1955年3月首次把汽车从西宁开到茫崖的司机郭万有说，进入盆地，谁不知道有着很大的困难，几百里长的戈壁，望不到尽头的泛浆地带，成群的野兽，弥天的风沙。在这些困难面前，反动统治者也知道里面有丰富的矿产，却吓得不敢进去，马步芳派人在近处弄了一点硼砂就回来了。只有共产党有这样大的气派，为了人民利益，不怕一切困难决定开发这个地方。1955年第一批进入盆地的工作人员陈伯贤说：右派分子说，不要共产党领导，我倒要问问：你们想叫谁领导？我并不是共产党员，但是事实告诉我，只是在共产党的领导下，国家的建设才能突飞猛进地向前发展。就拿盆地来说：1955年初，我们进来时从西宁到噶尔穆要九天，下半年缩短为五天，去年缩短为三天，现在两天就到了。在这样一个人迹罕到的地方，不到三年时间，盆地工作人员增加到好几万人，发现储油构造的喜讯，发现矿产的捷报，不断传来。好几个地方出现了新的城镇，许多地方竖起了井塔。发生了这样惊人的大变化！不是共产党，柴达木盆地连公路都修不通，进去多少人会冻死饿死多少人！的确有些党员有毛病，但是那是个别的。绝大多数党员都在辛辛苦苦地为人民工作着，表现了吃苦在前的精神。盆地里很多党员青年干部，奔走在工地上，那里有困难他们就出现在那里，这在旧社会一些当“官”的人能干到吗？去年曾在冷湖德令哈超额完成勘查任务的女子地质队的队员李圣芬说：大家都知道柴达木盆地的工作条件是很艰苦的。我们队上几个女同志，都离开学校不久来到这里。每天都是早上七点钟出工，跑出几公里，翻山越沟，一直忙碌到夜间十点以后才回来。在戈壁滩上，我们有时渴得嗓子痛话都不敢讲，疲倦得走不动喊着一二向前移，有时迷失方向在荒山野地乱转，大风把帐篷揭掉，大家蹲在地上休息。但是我们从不叫苦，反而对自己的职业充满着自豪感。这都归功于党的教育，它鼓舞着我们叫我们这样作。离开党，这一切都是很难设想的。右派分子反对党的领导，我坚决拥护党的领导。
