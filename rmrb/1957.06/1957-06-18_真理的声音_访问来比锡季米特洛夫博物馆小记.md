　　The Voice of Truth
　　——A Short Visit to the Dimitrov Museum in Leipzig
　　Zhang Pei
    Last summer when I visited Berlin, I stayed in a hotel called "Adlon." This hotel was just a stone's throw away from West Berlin. Across a small street was the famous Unter den Linden. Walking west along the street for less than five minutes brought you to the tall, dark Brandenburg Gate. Beyond this gate was West Berlin. To the right of the Brandenburg Gate stood the shattered skeleton of a building, scorched by war, which was Hitler's Reichstag.
    In 1945, heroic Soviet soldiers planted the victorious red flag on top of this building, proclaiming the final demise of Hitler's fascist rule. And in 1933, Hitler had declared in front of this building: "It is God's will that we now eliminate the Communists!" This was the extremely despicable conspiracy concocted by the newly ascended fascist Hitler: the "Reichstag Fire." Hitler began his anti-communist crusade from here. The fascists arrested Dimitrov, who was in Germany, and two other Bulgarian communists, falsely accusing them of being the arsonists who burned the Reichstag. Dimitrov was imprisoned in Berlin for half a year before being sent to Leipzig for "trial."
    On our last day in Leipzig, we visited the Dimitrov Museum. This was the high court of the fascists where the Leipzig "Trial" of 1933-34 shocked the world.
    In just a few minutes, the car took us from the hotel to the Dimitrov Museum. We first visited some documents and pictures about Dimitrov's life and explaining the truth of the "Reichstag Fire," and then entered the hall where Dimitrov was tried, which was the courtroom. The room was very large, with walls and ceilings carved with raised and recessed patterns. European-style chandelier hung from the ceiling. On the platform was a horseshoe-shaped long table and several high-backed chairs for the judges. Behind the railings on both sides of the platform were the witness seats, and several rows of benches were placed in the middle. Comrade Dimitrov stood on the left side of the platform, being tried. It was here that an outstanding communist issued an indelible voice of truth to the world:
    "I am defending myself as an accused communist.
    I am defending the glory of my communist revolution.
    I am defending my ideas, my communist beliefs.
    I am defending the meaning and content of my life."
    From September 21 to December 16, 1933, Dimitrov was tried many times in this court. The fascist court used every method to torture Dimitrov, trying to force him to admit that he had organized the arson. But Dimitrov, an infinitely firm communist, repeatedly exposed the truth of the arson case with his fearless proletarian spirit and irrefutable facts, turning the fascist court into a communist platform.
    The news that spread from Leipzig enraged the working masses all over the world, setting off a worldwide wave of protest. The cry of "Release Dimitrov!" came from every corner of the earth. The real arsonists, the fascist murderers, had no choice but to release Dimitrov on February 27, 1934. Because the whole world already knew that the people who burned down the Reichstag near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin came through a tunnel, and this tunnel led directly to the residence of the fascist leader Goering.
    However, Dimitrov did not regard this victory as just a victory in his personal struggle. He said: "The failure of fascism in Leipzig is a victory for the international proletariat!"
    A middle-aged woman managing the museum told us that everything here is the same as it was during the trial. To be honest, there was not much to see in this hall, but we walked back and forth in the middle of the hall, not wanting to leave. Many impressions came to mind: the face of Dimitrov, the heroic worker-class fighter; the rise and fall of the fascist Hitler; the Reichstag, scorched by war, that I had seen in Berlin not long ago; the Soviet soldiers who planted the red flag on top of this building... Twenty-three years have passed, and history has led us into a new stage—the stage of the victory of socialism in vast areas of Europe and Asia. During the last trial on December 16, 1933, Dimitrov recited a poem by the great German poet Goethe in this hall:
　　Prepare your wisdom in time,
　　In the great scales of happiness,
　　How little is granted to the pan to remain at rest!
　　Either you must rise,
　　Or you must fall;
　　You either seize power or submit,
　　Know,
　　Either triumph or pain,
　　Either swing the heavy hammer—
　　Or stand in the position of the anvil.
    After reading this poem in the fascist court, Dimitrov clenched his fist and said two more sentences: "Yes, whoever does not want to be the anvil should become the hammer!" Today, nine hundred million people on earth have taken up the hammer to smash the painful old system. Is there any doubt about the final triumph of socialism in the world?

　　真理的声音
　　——访问来比锡季米特洛夫博物馆小记
　　张沛
    去年夏季我访问柏林的时候，住在一个名叫“阿德龙”的旅馆。这个旅馆离西柏林只有一箭之遥。穿过一条小街，就是著名的菩提树下大街，沿街往西走，不用五分钟，就是那座高大黝黑的勃兰登堡门。过了这座门，就是西柏林了。在勃兰登堡门的右侧，有一座被战火烧焦了的支离破碎的大厦骨架，这就是希特勒的国会。
    1945年，英勇的苏军战士把胜利的红旗插上了这座大厦顶端，宣告希特勒法西斯统治的最后复灭。而1933年，希特勒曾经在这座大厦的跟前宣告：“这是上帝的意旨，现在我们要消灭共产党人！”这就是刚刚上台的法西斯希特勒所制造的一场极其卑鄙的阴谋：“国会纵火案。”希特勒从这里开始了他的反共大进军。法西斯分子逮捕了正在德国的季米特洛夫和另外两个保加利亚的共产党员，诬蔑他们是焚烧国会的放火者。季米特洛夫在柏林监狱中被关了半年，然后送到来比锡去“审判”。
    我们留在来比锡的最后一天，去访问了季米特洛夫博物馆。这里也就是在1933—34年以来比锡“审判”轰动世界的法西斯的高等法庭。
    大约只有几分钟的时间，汽车就把我们从旅馆送到季米特洛夫博物馆。我们首先参观了有关季米特洛夫生平和说明“国会纵火案”真相的一些文件和图片，然后就进入季米特洛夫受审的大厅，也就是法庭。房子很高大，墙壁和天花板都雕刻有凸凹形的花纹。天花板下垂着欧洲式的枝形大吊灯。台上是马蹄形的长桌和几张法官坐的高背椅子。台下两侧栏杆后面是证人的席位，中间放着几排长椅。季米特洛夫同志就站在台的左侧受审。就在这里，一个杰出的共产主义者，向全世界发出了不可磨灭的真理的声音：
    “我是以被控告的共产主义者的资格为自己本身作辩护的。
    我是为着自己的共产主义的革命的光荣而辩护的。
    我是为着自己的思想，自己的共产主义信仰而辩护的。
    我是为着自己的生活底意义和内容而辩护的。”
    从1933年9月21日开始到12月16日，季米特洛夫就在这个法庭上受了许多次审判。法西斯法庭用尽了各种方法折磨季米特洛夫，企图迫使他承认是他组织纵火的。可是无比坚定的共产主义者季米特洛夫，一次又一次地以他大无畏的无产阶级的气概和无可辩驳的事实，揭露了纵火案的真相，把法西斯的法庭变成了共产主义者的讲坛。
    从来比锡传出去的消息，激怒了全世界的劳动群众，掀起了世界范围的抗议的怒潮，“释放季米特洛夫！”的呼声从地球上各个角落传来，真正的放火者法西斯凶手，不得不在1934年的2月27日释放了季米特洛夫。因为全世界都已经知道，放火烧掉柏林勃兰登堡门附近的国会大厦的人，是经过一个地道来的，而这个地道一直通往法西斯头子戈林的住宅。
    但是，季米特洛夫并不把这场胜利看作只是他个人斗争的胜利，他说：“法西斯主义在来比锡的失败，是国际无产阶级的胜利！”
    管理博物馆的一位中年妇女告诉我们：这里的一切都是当年审判时的样子。说实话，这个大厅没有什么可以多看的，可是我们在大厅中间来回地走着，不想离开。许多印象都来到脑际：英勇的工人阶级的战士季米特洛夫的面容、法西斯希特勒的上台与灭亡、不久以前我在柏林看过的被战火烧焦了的国会大厦、把红旗插到这所大厦顶端的苏军士兵……。二十三年过去了，历史把我们领进了一个新的阶段——社会主义在欧、亚广大地区胜利的阶段。1933年12月16日最后一次审判中，季米特洛夫在这个大厅里念过德国大诗人歌德的一首诗：
　　及时准备好自己的智慧，
　　在幸福底伟大天秤里，
　　极少赋与秤盘泰然呵！
　　或者你应跳起来，
　　或者你得垂下来；
　　你或掌握权威抑或屈服，
　　须知，
　　或是凯旋或是痛苦，
　　或者挥舞沉重的铁锤——
　　或者站到铁砧的地位。
    季米特洛夫在法西斯的法庭上读完这首诗后，捏紧了拳头，又说了两句话：“是的，谁不愿意成为铁砧，谁就应当成为铁锤！”今天地球上已经有九亿人民拿起铁锤粉碎了令人痛苦的旧制度，社会主义在全世界的最终凯旋，难道还有什么疑问吗？
