How Should Township and Commune Cadres Participate in Production?

Currently, many township and commune cadres are actively participating in production. However, it is necessary to study the best way for them to participate. Based on our experience in Xuancheng area, Anhui province, the current ways for cadres to participate in production are as follows:

First, the production team allocates land to cadres for individual production and work point recording. The commune then unifies the distribution and implements contract work and output. For example, the Hanting District Creative Agricultural Cooperative adopts this method, where each commune cadre is allocated 2.2 mu of land for individual cultivation. The advantage of this method is that it is easy to record work points, and the cadres have a strong sense of responsibility for production, and can also set an example for the commune members. The disadvantage is that they cannot lead production during production, and cannot combine leading production with their own production.

Second, cadres collectively reclaim wasteland and engage in production together. For example, Xintian Township in Zhouwang District adopts this method. The advantage is that it can expand the cultivated area, and it is easy to manage, and cadres have a strong momentum in production. The disadvantage is that it requires a certain amount of time, cadres must be concentrated, they cannot discover and solve problems from production, and they need a separate set of production tools.

Third, cadres participate in production wherever they work. The advantage is that it facilitates work and does not detach them from the masses. The disadvantage is, as the masses reflect: "Cadres dabble here and there in production, and it is difficult to record work points." At the same time, the cadres themselves do not have a sense of responsibility for production, and it often becomes a formality, and there is no standard for future work point subsidies.

Fourth, taking into account residence and work, cadres are assigned to specific areas for contracted responsibility and production tasks, and they participate in production locally. For example, the Baihua Cooperative in Wan'er District has more than 600 households and is divided into three areas, each with two cadres. In addition to being responsible for the work in this area, each cadre is required to do eight workdays per month. Xu Jilai, the director of the cooperative, lives in the second area and is also assigned to work in the second area. In addition to work, he takes time every day to participate in production, and can do three to four work points. The advantages of this method are: it can strengthen the sense of responsibility for work, it can improve production, it can give full play to the enthusiasm of cadres to participate in production, it can integrate with the masses, and it can truly play the role of leading production in production. Cadres are satisfied, commune members are happy, and work points are easy to record.

Among the above four methods, we believe that the last method is better. However, in order to give full play to the leading role of cadres, this method must establish a system for regular meetings to study work, and prevent the deviation of "division of areas like division of families, with no communication with each other."

We lack experience in cadres participating in production. We hope everyone will study which method is better.

### 乡、社干部怎样参加生产？

    乡、社干部怎样参加生产？
    目前已有很多乡、社干部积极地参加了生产，究竟怎样参加生产才好，办法须要研究一下。从我们安徽宣城地区来看，当前干部参加生产有以下几种方式：
    第一，由生产队拨田，干部单独生产，单独记工，由社统一分配，进行包工包产。如寒亭区创造农业社就是采用这种办法，每一个社干部由生产队拨田二亩二分单独种。这种办法的好处是便于记工，干部的生产责任心强，也可以做出样子给社员看。缺点是不能在生产中领导生产，不能使领导生产和自己生产结合起来。
    第二，干部集体开荒，一起生产。如周王区新田乡就采取这种办法。好处是可以扩大耕地面积，也便于管理，干部生产劲头大。缺点是要有一定的时间，干部要集中，不能从生产中发现问题解决问题，还要单独有一套生产工具。
    第三，干部在哪里工作，就在哪里生产。好处是便于工作，不脱离群众。缺点是：正如群众反映：“干部生产这里捣一下，那里插一下，工分不好记。”同时干部本身对生产也没有责任心，往往流于形式，今后工分补贴也没有标准。
    第四，照顾居住、工作分片包干，分配生产任务，干部就地参加生产。如湾儿区百花社有六百多户，划为三片，每片有两个干部。干部除负责这一片工作外，每人每月规定做八个劳动日。社主任徐继来，家住在第二片，本人分工也在第二片，除工作外，每天抽出时间参加生产，可以做到三至四分工。这种办法好处是：既能加强工作责任心，又能搞好生产，既能发挥干部参加生产的积极性，又能与群众打成一片，真正能起到在生产中领导生产的作用，干部满意，社员也欢喜，工分又好记。
    以上四种办法，我们认为最后一种办法较好。但为了发挥干部的领导作用，这种办法，必须订立制度，定期碰头研究工作，防止“分片如分家，互不通气”的偏向。
    我们对干部参加生产还缺乏经验，到底那种办法好，希望大家研究。　　王绍刚、崔峰
