Your Excellency Vice Chairman Zhu De of the People's Republic of China, Your Excellency Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Honorable Delegates of the National People's Congress, Your Excellency Premier, Honorable Ministers, Respected Guests:

	First of all, please allow me to express my gratitude for the invitation to visit China, in order to maintain and strengthen the friendly relations between our two nations. At the same time, I take this opportunity to convey the friendly greetings of the Indonesian nation, especially the Constitutional Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia.

	Honorable Chairman, it is indeed an honor to have the opportunity to speak at a meeting of the National People's Congress, which marks the unity of the entire Chinese people and serves as the highest decision-making body of the state of the People's Republic of China. I take this opportunity to frankly express our sentiments to the representatives of the people gathered here, that is: I am convinced that this approach will make our mutual understanding deeper and more substantive.

	We are very pleased to be able to meet today with the representatives of the National People's Congress, who represent the entire Chinese people. We firmly believe that this is a good way to broadly recognize and understand each other. The recognition I am referring to is not only the personal recognition between those of us who have the opportunity to meet and shake hands, but also the recognition between the two nations we represent. The Chinese and Indonesian nations have had close relations for hundreds of years, and now the responsibility of maintaining this relationship on the basis of a deep understanding of each other's situations, needs, and political ideals falls on the shoulders of our generation. We are confident that if our friendship is maintained on the basis I just mentioned, it will continue forever and be mutually beneficial. Current indications give us confidence to move in this direction.

	Honorable Chairman and Delegates:

	Although there are bound to be differences between our two nations, I will only mention the very important fundamental commonalities between us, which give us a feeling of shared destiny and shared responsibility. This very important fundamental commonality is:

	We are currently in a period of transition.

	We have brought the old situation to an end and are now moving towards building a new situation, which, in our view, is better and more in line with the feelings of justice and humanity. We have successfully overthrown most of the colonial rule in our respective countries, although it remains a danger to us. At the same time, we have basically eradicated the forces of capitalists that have caused so much suffering to our people. Although the forms and nature of colonial rule and capitalist forces in Indonesia and China are different, their methods and consequences for the people are the same. In our history, we have fallen victim to the despicable and cunning conspiracies of imperialists and capitalists, but now we have awakened and will no longer be deceived. We are prepared to defend our rights and realize our lofty political ideals with our lives.

	During this transitional period of our struggle for a new situation, we will encounter many obstacles, whether from the outside or from our own society. The obstacles of the transitional period are usually of a serious and dangerous nature. Some countries that have become accustomed to making profits by colonizing other nations will inevitably do everything possible to maintain the colonial system. When possible, they will adopt old methods, but when the situation requires it, they will also adopt new methods, which may be more dangerous than those they have used in the past. Their economic power leaves many countries in a state of helplessness, so that they have to comply with the wishes of the colonialists. In the current international situation, new forms of colonial rule are more dangerous for countries that are still weak, especially those in transition. I believe that as long as any form of colonial ideology still exists in this world, the danger of being threatened for the various nations in transition is not small. In addition to the great danger of external threats, the internal danger is also not small. This danger lies in the forces in our own society that prefer the old situation, in which capitalists played a major role in determining national policies and causing suffering to the majority of the people. From some of what I have said above, it is true that I say that our two nations have common ground. That is why I am very pleased to accept the friendly invitation of the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in order to closely observe how the Chinese people are solving the various problems they face in the transitional period.

	I mentioned above that there are differences between us, and these differences arise because our nations have their own characteristics, which require us to take our own paths in the cause of building a new society. Taking these characteristics into account, we strive to find reference materials that are useful for drafting our constitution.

	Although, as I said just now, there are differences between us in the cause of striving for the happiness of mankind, our two nations have a common aspiration. This aspiration is: both of our nations, the Chinese and Indonesian nations, hope to realize their respective ideals in a peaceful environment without interference, in order to build a society full of justice and humanitarianism, a society without the exploitation of man by man. Now we, the Indonesian nation, are striving to ensure that the basic idea of social justice is established in the new constitution.

	On the basis of the feeling of common destiny and common responsibility, we can maintain our friendly and cooperative relations by realizing the basic spirit of the ten principles of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung.

	Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader who successfully led the Chinese people in their struggle to realize the ideals of the Chinese people.

	I have finished my speech, thank you.

### 转达印度尼西亚人民的友好问候  印度尼西亚制宪议会议长韦洛坡在我人代会上的演说词

　　转达印度尼西亚人民的友好问候
    印度尼西亚制宪议会议长韦洛坡在我人代会上的演说词中华人民共和国副主席朱德阁下，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长阁下，尊敬的全国人民代表大会各位代表，总理阁下，各位部长，尊敬的全体来宾：
    首先，请允许我对邀请我前来中国访问，以维持和加强我们两个民族之间的友好关系，表示谢意。同时我利用这个机会转达印度尼西亚民族，特别是印度尼西亚共和国制宪议会的友好的问候。
    尊敬的主席先生，我有机会在标志着全中国人民的团结，以及作为中华人民共和国国家的最高决策机关的全国人民代表大会的会议上讲话，这的确是一件荣幸的事情。我利用这一机会坦然地向集合在这里的各位人民代表表达我们的心意，这就是：我深信，这种办法将会使我们互相之间的了解更加深入和富有内容。
    我们今天能够同代表中国全体人民的全国人民代表大会代表们见面，感到十分高兴。我们深信，这是彼此广泛地认识和了解的很好的办法。我所指的认识，不仅是有机会见面和握手的我们个人之间的认识，而且是我们所代表的两个民族之间的认识。中国和印度尼西亚两个民族数百年来就有着密切的关系，而现在在深刻了解彼此的情况、需要和政治理想的基础上来保持这种关系的责任就落在我们这一代人的肩上。我们深信，我们之间的友谊，如果在刚才我所说的基础上加以保持，它就会永远继续下去，并且具有互利的性质。目前的各种迹象使我们有信心朝着这个方向走。
    尊敬的主席先生和各位代表先生们：
    虽然我们两个民族之间一定会存在着不同的地方，但是我只提我们之间的非常重要的基本共同点，这个基本共同点使我们产生了命运相同和责任相同的感情。这个非常重要的基本共同点就是：
    我们目前都是处在过渡时期。
    我们已经使旧的情况结束了，现在正在走向建设新的情况，这个情况，根据我们的看法，是更好、更符合于公正和人道的感情。我们已经成功地推翻了我们各自国家的大部分殖民地统治，虽然它对我们仍然是一个危险的东西。同时，我们已经基本上铲除了使我们人民遭受很多苦难的资本家的势力。虽然在印度尼西亚和中国的殖民统治和资本家的势力的形式和性质是有所不同的，但是它们的手法和对人民所引起的后果却是相同的。在我们的历史上，我们曾经上过帝国主义者和资本主义者的卑鄙的和狡猾的阴谋诡计的当，但是现在，我们已经觉醒过来，再也不受欺骗了，我们准备以自己的生命来保卫我们的权利和实现我们的崇高的政治理想。
    在我们为了新情况而斗争的过渡时期内，我们将会遇到许多障碍，不论是来自外面或者来自我们社会本身。过渡时期的障碍通常具有着严重和危险的性质。一些已经习惯于通过对其他民族实行殖民统治来获取利润的国家，必然会全力地维护殖民制度。在可能的时候，它们将采用旧的方式，但是当形势需要的时候，它们也会采用新的方式，这种新的方式比它们过去所采用的方式可能更为危险。它们在经济方面的势力使得许多国家处于无能为力的状态，以致不得不顺从殖民主义者的愿望。在目前国际形势下，新的殖民统治方式对于还是软弱的国家，特别是处在过渡时期的国家来说，是更加危险的。我认为只要在这个世界上依然存在着任何形式的殖民思想的话，那末，处在过渡时期的各个民族受到威胁的危险性是不小的。除了受到外来的威胁的巨大危险之外，内在的危险也是不小的，这个危险就是在我们自己的社会里的一些更喜欢旧的情况的力量，在旧的情况中，资本家在决定国家方针和使多数人民遭受苦难方面起着主要的作用。从我上面所讲的一些话来看，那末，我说我们两个民族有着共同点，这话是不错的。正因为这样，我非常高兴地接受全国人民代表大会委员长先生的友好的邀请，以便就近观察中国人民如何解决在过渡时期所面临的种种问题。
    我在上面提到我们之间有不同点，这个不同点是由于我们民族都有自己的特点而产生的，这些特点使我们在建立新社会的事业中，必须走自己道路。在注意到这些特点的情况下，我们努力寻找对我们制定宪法有用的参考材料。
    虽然，刚才我谈到，我们在争取人类的幸福的事业中存在着不同的地方，但是我们两个民族都有共同的愿望。这个愿望就是：我们两个民族，中国和印度尼西亚民族都希望让它们在不被干涉的和平环境中实现各自的理想，以便建立一个充满着公正和人道主义的社会，一个没有人剥削人的社会。现在我们印度尼西亚民族正在努力使社会公正这个基本思想在新宪法中确定下来。
    在共同命运和共同责任的感情的基础上，我们可以通过实现在万隆举行的亚非会议的十项原则的基本精神，来保持我们的友好合作关系。
    最后，我谨向在斗争中成功地领导中国人民，实现中国人民的理想的伟大领袖毛泽东主席表示敬意。
    我的话完了，谢谢。（附图片）
