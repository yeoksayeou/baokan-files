Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: "Soviet scientists and engineers have already built the rockets and other equipment necessary to launch artificial satellites." This was said by Academician N. Semyanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in an article published in today's "Pravda."

N. Semyanov said in the article that the first Soviet artificial satellite will move at a distance of approximately several hundred kilometers from the Earth's surface. During the International Geophysical Year, both the Soviet Union and the United States will launch several such artificial satellites.

He said that launching artificial satellites is to study cosmic rays, because research on cosmic ray radiation can clarify the questions of the time cosmic particles exist in space and the movement of cosmic rays. In addition, artificial satellites are also used to study the changes in the intensity of radiation at different altitudes and in different regions, as well as to study natural phenomena such as the swaying of the Earth's magnetic field and meteors.

N. Semyanov also said that the creation and launching of artificial satellites is the first important step towards realizing interplanetary flight.

    空际飞行的第一个重要步骤
    苏联制成放射人造卫星的火箭
    新华社莫斯科1日电　“苏联的学者和工程师们已经造好了发射人造卫星所必需的火箭和其它装备。”这是苏联科学院长?斯米扬诺夫今天在“真理报”上写的一篇文章中说的。
    ?斯米扬诺夫在文章中说，第一颗苏联的人造卫星将在离地球表面大约几百公里的地方运动。在国际地球物理年度，苏联和美国都将要放射出好几颗这样的人造卫星。
    他说，放射人造卫星是为了研究宇宙射线。因为对宇宙线放射的研究可以弄清关于宇宙粒子在太空中存在的时间和宇宙射线运行的问题。此外，放射人造卫星还为了研究放射线在不同高度、不同区域间强度的变化情况，以及研究地球磁场的摇摆和流星等的自然现象。
    ?斯米扬诺夫又说，创造和放射人造卫星是实现空际飞行的第一个重要步骤。
