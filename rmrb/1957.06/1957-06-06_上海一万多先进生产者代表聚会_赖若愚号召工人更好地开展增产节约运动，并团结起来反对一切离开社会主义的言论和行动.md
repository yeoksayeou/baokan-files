Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th. Shanghai held its 1956 Advanced Production (Work) Representatives Conference this afternoon, with over ten thousand advanced producer representatives attending the conference.

    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Lai Ruoyu made a special trip from Beijing this afternoon to attend the conference.

    Lai Ruoyu first congratulated everyone on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He said: The Chinese working class is an organized and conscious class, especially the workers in Shanghai. In the history of the Chinese revolution, many glorious deeds are inseparable from the workers of Shanghai.

    Lai Ruoyu then said: Our country's socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory. We are arduously carrying out socialist construction, and there are still many difficulties. At present, it is necessary to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement well. Only by improving production can we have a basis for overcoming other difficulties. He also said: We workers should unite to oppose all speech and actions that deviate from socialism.

    Lai Ruoyu finally expressed his hope that through this Advanced Producer Representatives Conference, the increase production and practice economy movement in Shanghai would be carried out better, the unity of the working class would be further strengthened, and the advanced producer movement would have greater development.

    Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, also encouraged the advanced producers at the meeting to maintain their honor and lead the city's employees to build the country better.

    The number of people elected as advanced producers at the Shanghai municipal level in 1956 was more than eight hundred more than last year.

    In recent days, the city's workers' cultural palaces and workers' clubs have widely introduced the advanced deeds of advanced producers through picture exhibitions, organizing advanced producers to meet with workers, and holding lectures. Many industrial trade unions are also preparing to comprehensively promote the various advanced experiences of advanced producers.
