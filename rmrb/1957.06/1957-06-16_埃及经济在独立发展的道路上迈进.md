    Egyptian Economy Advances on the Road of Independent Development
    Gu Yizhi, Director of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association
    Egypt is an ancient agricultural country. The Nile River has endowed the Egyptian people with fertile land and nurtured Egypt's prosperous ancient culture. However, in modern times, the Egyptian people, like many Asian and African peoples, have suffered from the scourge of colonialism. The Egyptian people have long struggled against colonialism to win their country's independence and freedom. In 1952, a great change took place in Egypt. The Egyptian people overthrew the Farouk feudal dynasty and established the Republic of Egypt on June 18, 1953.
    In the years since the founding of the Republic of Egypt, Egypt has made great achievements in developing its national economy.
    In industry, the government of the Republic of Egypt has actively built state-owned enterprises, vigorously encouraged the development of private capital, and in order to protect Egypt's national industry, has adopted protective tariffs, restricted imports of consumer goods, reduced import taxes on industrial equipment, exempted new enterprises from taxes, and provided new enterprises with access to foreign exchange. Therefore, Egyptian industry has developed rapidly. For example, the Egyptian Iron and Steel Company was established in 1954 to develop the Aswan hematite mine. A large steel plant is now under construction in Helwan, which will produce 235,000 tons of steel annually by 1957. An oil refinery was built in Cairo in June 1955, which is expected to refine more than 200,000 tons of crude oil annually after its completion. On February 9 this year, the Eastern Petroleum Company, a joint venture between Egyptian and foreign capital, was established. In addition to refining crude oil, the company will also exploit oil mines in the Sinai Peninsula and plans to increase oil production by more than 1.4 million tons in 1958. According to Egyptian Minister of Industry Sidqi, "Due to the great development prospects of this new company, Egypt will not only be self-sufficient in oil, but will also become an oil exporter in the near future." The tire factory in Alexandria is also nearing completion, and shipyards and new docks are also under construction. Before 1953, Egypt's annual electricity production was 400 million kilowatt-hours. In 1953, it reached 1 billion kilowatt-hours. In recent years, some power stations have been newly built and expanded, and a large hydroelectric power station is currently being built in Aswan. After its completion in 1959, the power station will generate 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours. Construction of a state-owned factory with an annual output of 500,000 tons of cement began in March 1956. At the beginning of 1956, construction of a chemical fertilizer plant in Aswan began, and after its completion in 1959, it will be able to produce 370,000 tons of fertilizer annually. At the same time, the Egyptian government has also built several new munitions factories. As for light industries such as textiles, rayon, sugar making, soap, cigarettes, food processing, and matches, they have all developed considerably.
    Abdul Boghdadi, Chairman of the Egyptian National Planning Committee, declared on February 28 this year that Egypt is currently formulating a ten-year economic development plan (1958-1968), which plans to build 140 projects with an investment of 1.8 billion Egyptian pounds. Industrial projects will be distributed throughout the country. After the plan is completed, Egypt's national income will increase from 900 million Egyptian pounds per year to 1.54 billion Egyptian pounds. The realization of this plan is a major measure in Egypt's economic construction and will lay a good foundation for Egypt's economic development.
    In agriculture, the Egyptian government has also taken a number of important measures. In September 1952, they promulgated the "Land Reform Law," which stipulated the confiscation of the royal family's land (about 200,000 feddans); the land owned by general landlords was limited to no more than 200 feddans (equivalent to 1,300 mu in China), and all surplus land was to be purchased by the state and transferred to landless and land-poor farmers or sold by the landlords to farmers at market prices. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Land Reform, the land reform work will be fully completed by the end of 1957, and the allocated land will reach more than 600,000 feddans. The requisitioned land accounts for about one-tenth of the total cultivated land in the country, and landless and land-poor farmers are allocated an average of about half a feddan per household (equivalent to 3.15 mu in China). It is stipulated that the land rent shall not exceed half of the harvest, and the rent shall not exceed 21.5 Egyptian pounds per feddan. In addition, the minimum wage for hired laborers is stipulated, hired laborers are allowed to organize farmers' associations, and farmers are encouraged to organize agricultural cooperatives. The implementation of these measures has indeed weakened the feudal ownership system, limited the degree of feudal exploitation, and is beneficial to the vast number of Egyptian farmers.
    Not only that, the Egyptian government has also formulated a plan for the extensive development of agriculture, to actively build water conservancy projects, vigorously reclaim wasteland, and expand the cultivated area. In 1953, the Egyptian government established the "Liberation Province" in the desert area west of the Nile Delta, planning to turn large areas of desert into fertile fields. In the past four years, the province has reclaimed more than 20,000 feddans, and it is planned to reclaim 1.2 million feddans within fifteen years. According to the governor of the "Liberation Province" in March this year, the Egyptian government will build a huge reservoir in the Natron Valley between Cairo and Alexandria to intercept the floods of the Nile River. The use of the water from this reservoir for irrigation will turn 1.2 million feddans of land into fertile fields, expanding the country's cultivated area by more than 20%. This project is scheduled to begin on July 1 this year and is expected to be completed in four or five years.
    From the above brief situation, it can be seen that since 1952, with the joint efforts of the Egyptian government and people, Egypt's national economy has been advancing rapidly.
    However, the imperialists are not willing to see the development of Egypt's national economy. Especially after the Egyptian government announced on July 26 last year that it would nationalize the Suez Canal Company, the British, American, and French imperialists adopted many despicable means: freezing Egyptian assets in Britain, the United States, and France, prohibiting the transport of military supplies to Egypt, stopping material "aid" to Egypt, refusing to pay fees for passing through the canal... etc., attempting to create economic chaos in Egypt and force the Egyptian government to submit. But as President Nasser said, "The economic sanctions imposed by the three powers cannot force Egypt to surrender. The economic pressure that the three countries have imposed on us may affect us, but it will not starve us to death." The Egyptian people gave a resolute response to the imperialist economic boycott.
    At the end of October 1956, the British, French, and Israeli war of aggression against Egypt broke out. During the war, Egypt did face a severe test, many new difficulties arose, ports were blockaded, foreign transportation was cut off, major cities were bombed, the source of material supply was reduced, and cotton exports were affected. However, in order to overcome these difficulties, the Egyptian government decisively took many effective measures. They requisitioned the British and French oil companies in Egypt, took over all the major British and French banks, companies, and enterprises, vigorously sought international assistance from friendly countries, and implemented wartime economic management, thereby ensuring the glorious victory of the anti-aggression war.
    After the victory of the war of resistance, in order to completely eliminate the colonial forces and completely uproot the old roots of the colonialists in Egypt, the Egyptian government promulgated the decree on the "Egyptianization" of foreign banks and insurance companies this year. The implementation of this measure will greatly promote the independent development of the Egyptian economy.
    On the road of the development of Egypt's national economy, the Egyptian government's policy of developing economic cooperation with all countries has obviously produced positive results. In recent years, Egypt has begun trade with socialist countries, and the facts have proved that this new type of trade relationship based on equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs is fully in line with the interests of the Republic of Egypt. Therefore, the trade volume has risen rapidly. For example, before the revolution, Egypt's exports to socialist countries accounted for only 10.9% of the total export value, and in the first half of 1956, it reached 35.6%. Imports rose from 6.4% to 11.9%. In particular, Egypt's cotton exports to socialist countries in 1956 reached 40.5% of the total output, which shows that Egypt has found new customers.
    During the most difficult period of Egypt's struggle to recover the Suez Canal Company and the war of resistance, socialist countries enthusiastically provided Egypt with sincere assistance in all aspects. Facts have once again proved that socialist countries are Egypt's reliable friends in times of trouble. The people of Asian and African countries have also given great sympathy and help to the struggle of the Egyptian people. The editorial of the Egyptian "Evening News" expressed the Egyptian people's understanding: "The Suez Canal crisis has clearly reflected who are our friends and who are our enemies."
    Therefore, people can fully believe that although the colonialists are still doing everything possible to obstruct the development of Egypt's national economy, the Egyptian people have friends all over the world, and they will surely be able to overcome any economic difficulties and make their motherland prosperous and strong.

    埃及经济在独立发展的道路上迈进
    中埃友好协会理事　顾逸之
    埃及是个古老的农业国家，尼罗河赋予埃及人民以富饶的土地，并孕育了埃及的昌盛的古文化。但是，近代以来，埃及人民同许多亚非国家人民一样，遭到了殖民主义的祸害。埃及人民为了争取祖国的独立和自由，曾长期地进行了反殖民主义的斗争。1952年，埃及发生了伟大的变化，埃及人民推翻了法鲁克封建王朝，并在1953年6月18日建立了埃及共和国。
    在埃及共和国成立后的数年间，埃及在发展民族经济方面，已经取得了很大的成就。
    在工业方面，埃及共和国政府积极兴建国家企业，大力鼓励私人资本的发展，并为了保护埃及的民族工业，已采取了保护关税，限制消费品入口，减低工业装备进口税，免征新企业税以及给新企业取得外汇的便利等措施，因此埃及工业得到了迅速的发展。如1954年成立了埃及钢铁公司，着手开发阿斯旺赤铁矿，现正在赫耳万兴建一座大型钢铁厂，到1957年可年产二十三万五千吨钢铁。1955年6月在开罗兴建一座炼油厂，预计在建成后每年可炼二十余万吨原油。今年2月9日，埃及和外国资本合营的东方石油公司已成立，该公司除了提炼原油外，还要开采西奈半岛的油矿，计划1958年将增产石油一百四十多万吨。据埃及工业部长西德基称：“由于这个新公司的发展前途很大，埃及不仅将要在石油方面自给自足，而且还要在今后不久成为石油的出口国”。亚历山大的轮胎厂也快建成了，造船厂和新的船坞也正在着手兴建。在1953年以前，埃及每年的电力生产量是四亿度，1953年已达十亿度。近年来已新建和扩建了一些发电站，目前正在阿斯旺修建着一个大型水力发电站，1959年完工后该电站可发电十七亿度。1956年3月已开始建造一座年产五十万吨水泥的国营工厂。1956年初已着手在阿斯旺建造一座化学肥料厂，1959年完工后能够每年生产三十七万吨肥料。同时，埃及政府还新建了若干军火工厂。至于纺织、人造丝、制糖、肥皂、卷烟、食品加工、火柴等轻工业，都有相当发展。
    埃及国家计划委员会主席阿卜杜勒·波格达迪今年2月28日宣称，埃及目前正在制定一个十年经济发展计划（1958—1968年），拟兴建一百四十个工程项目，投资达十八亿埃镑，工业工程将分布在全国各地区。计划完成后，埃及国民收入将从每年九亿埃镑提高到十五亿四千万埃镑。实现这个计划，是埃及经济建设中的重大措施，将给埃及的经济发展打下一个良好的基础。
    在农业方面，埃及政府同样采取了若干重要措施。他们在1952年9月即公布了“土地改革法”，规定没收皇室家族的土地（约二十余万费丹）；限制一般地主占有的土地不超过二百费丹（约合我国一千三百市亩），所有多余土地均一律由国家征购转给无地少地农民或按市价由地主自行出卖给农民。据埃及土地改革部宣称：土改工作将于1957年底全部完成，分配土地将达六十余万费丹。征购土地约占全国耕地总面积的十分之一，无地少地的农民平均每户分得土地约半费丹（合我国3.15市亩）。规定地租不得超过收获量的半数，租金每费丹不得超过二十一点五埃镑。此外，还规定了雇农最低工资额，允许雇农组织农会，鼓励农民组织农业合作社等。这些措施实行的结果，确实削弱了封建所有制度，限制了封建剥削程度，对埃及广大农民是有利的。
    不仅如此，埃及政府还制定了广泛发展农业的计划，以积极兴修水利，大力开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。1953年埃及政府在尼罗河三角洲以西沙漠地区成立了“解放省”，计划把大片沙漠地区变成良田。四年来，这个省已开荒二万余费丹，计划在十五年内将要开荒一百二十万费丹。根据“解放省”行政长官今年3月宣称，埃及政府将在开罗和亚历山大港之间的纳特龙山谷修建一座巨大的水库，以拦蓄尼罗河的洪水。利用这座水库的水进行灌溉，将使一百二十万费丹的土地变成良田，使全国耕地面积扩大20％多。这项工程计划将在今年7月1日开始执行，预定四、五年内完成。
    从以上这些简略的情况中可以看出，从1952年以来，在埃及政府和人民的共同努力下，埃及的民族经济是在迅速地前进着。
    但是，帝国主义是不甘心看到埃及民族经济的发展的，特别是去年7月26日埃及政府宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后，英、美、法帝国主义采用了许多卑鄙手段：冻结埃及在英、美、法的资产，禁止军用物资运往埃及，停止对埃及的物资“援助”，拒绝缴纳通过运河的费用……等等，企图造成埃及的经济混乱，迫使埃及政府屈服。但正如纳赛尔总统所说的：“三大国实行的经济制裁，决不能迫使埃及投降。三国对我们所施加的经济压力，可能使我们受到影响，可是不会使我们饿死。”埃及人民对帝国主义的经济抵制给予了坚决的回击。
    1956年10月底，英、法和以色列的侵埃战争爆发。战争期间，埃及确实面临着严重的考验，许多新的困难产生了，港口受到封锁，对外交通断绝了，主要城市遭到轰炸，物资供应来源减少，棉花出口受到影响。但埃及政府为了克服这些困难，曾果断地采取了许多有效的措施，他们征用了英、法在埃及的各石油公司，接管了英、法的一切主要银行、公司、企业，大力地争取各友好国家的国际援助，并实行了战时经济管理，从而保证了反侵略战争的光荣胜利。
      抗战胜利后，埃及政府为了彻底清除殖民势力，把殖民者在埃及的老根完全拔掉，今年已颁布了关于外国银行和保险公司“埃及化”的法令，这一措施的执行势将对埃及经济的独立发展会起重大的推动作用。
    在埃及民族经济发展的道路上，埃及政府奉行与一切国家发展经济合作关系的政策，显然已产生了积极的成果。近年来埃及与社会主义国家开始了贸易来往，事实证明了这种建立在平等互利、互不干涉内政基础上的新式贸易关系，是完全符合埃及共和国的利益的。因此，贸易额上升很快，如革命以前埃及对社会主义国家的输出仅占出口总值10.9％，1956年上半年达35.6％。输入从6.4％上升到11.9％，特别是埃及的棉花1956年输入社会主义国家达总输出量的40.5％，这说明埃及已经找到了新主顾。
    在埃及收回苏伊士运河公司的斗争和抗战的最困难时期，社会主义国家热情地给予了埃及各方面的真诚支援。事实再次说明了社会主义国家乃是埃及在患难中的可靠朋友。亚非各国人民对埃及人民的斗争也给予了极大的同情和帮助。埃及“晚报”社论曾表达了埃及人民的认识：“苏伊士运河危机已经清楚地反映了谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。”
    因此人们完全可以相信，虽然殖民主义者还在百般阻挠埃及民族经济的发展，但是，埃及人民的朋友遍天下，他们一定能够克服任何经济上的困难，使自己的祖国走向繁荣和富强。
