Summer Planting Farming Proverbs

　　In spring, we compete against the days; in summer, we compete against the hours.
    For May fields, planting one day earlier means the crop will be a fist taller.
　　Summer planting brooks no delay, even for a moment.
    Planting one day earlier means harvesting ten days earlier.
　　Harvest a patch as soon as it ripens; plow a patch and sow it immediately.
