　　Personal Experience, New vs. Old
　　Socialism is the Best!
    Labor model and Deputy Director of the Labor Protection and Welfare Department of the Chinese Construction Workers' Union, Su Changyou, said: Recently, some statements by right-wingers have appeared in the newspapers, and I feel very angry. I don’t know what their intentions are, using the rectification campaign to attack the Party. I say: Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Taking my own history as an example: In the old society, I begged for food wearing a burlap sack. I started learning bricklaying at the age of thirteen and was once knocked off a scaffold four stories high by the Japanese devils, barely escaping death. This was the result of the traitorous actions of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, which caused the Chinese people to suffer all the miseries of being enslaved by a foreign power. After Japan surrendered, I was in Tieling at that time. The Kuomintang not only didn't engage in construction but also demolished houses everywhere. Masons had no work to do and couldn't even get one full meal a day. My whole family was on the verge of starvation. Once, I thought of digging up tree roots on the hillside to sell for money to make ends meet, but I was caught by Kuomintang soldiers, who beat me black and blue, breaking my ribs. When I returned home, my entire family, old and young, were staring at each other, waiting for food. This was the life of the common people during the Kuomintang era. With the Communist Party, I, like all the workers, became masters of the new society, and life changed. In 1949, after I joined the work at Benxi Coal and Iron Company, I learned from the advanced Soviet experience and became a labor model. In 1951, I participated in the National Day celebration in Beijing. In 1952, I went to the Soviet Union and Poland to participate in the celebration again. Later, I was sent to a worker-peasant rapid school for study. I was an illiterate poor child, but now I have a junior high school education. In 1954, I was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. Workers are truly the masters of the country. This had never happened in Chinese history before. Recently, I also had the opportunity, as a representative of the National People's Congress and Deputy Director of the Labor Protection and Welfare Department, to inspect the living conditions of farmers and construction workers in various parts of the country. Many living facts prove that those anti-Party statements are nonsense. In the Northeast, I visited the Xincun Agricultural Cooperative near Anshan. The four hundred peasant households living there were poor peasants and hired laborers who couldn't get enough to eat or wear in the old society. Now, they not only eat well and dress well, but the women are wearing colorful clothes, and many households have sewing machines and radios. We visited many villages, and the situation was similar everywhere.

    Let me talk about our construction workers. In the old society, masons were regarded as lowly people, and their production, life, and lives were not guaranteed. They were chronically underfed and wore patched-up clothes year-round. A trowel and a tattered luggage roll that couldn't be tied up were their entire possessions. They worked thirteen or fourteen hours a day, often getting injured, beaten, or falling to their deaths, with no one caring. In Xiaofengman, Jilin, there was a mass grave where all those who died inside were construction workers. When winter came, masons had nowhere to turn.

    After liberation, the construction industry was elevated to an important position in national construction, and the production and lives of construction workers changed. In production, the state promulgated regulations to ensure the health and safety of workers, and various labor protection supplies and equipment were provided. In life, labor insurance benefits were implemented, ensuring security in case of birth, old age, illness, disability, or death. Before liberation, construction workers only built houses and could not live in new houses themselves. After liberation, in the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan alone, the state built tens of millions of square meters of housing for construction workers. Last year, during the wage reform, the wages of construction workers increased by 13%. How can it be said that only Party members and cadres have improved their lives?

    If you ask workers and peasants, they will say that socialism is the best, because socialism has brought us a good life, and socialism will bring us an even better life. Our construction workers see this most clearly. We have personally built countless factories, dormitories, offices, schools, and hospitals. We have also personally seen workers, peasants, ordinary people, and us construction workers move from dilapidated houses into newly built residences. However, people like Ge Peiqi, in the name of the people, want to overthrow the Communist Party, want the Communist Party to step down, and don't want socialism. We want to ask, if the Communist Party steps down, who will take over? We will never allow those people with ulterior motives to use the opportunity of the rectification campaign to attack the Party, intending to restore the old exploitative social system in China.

    Also speaking at the meeting were Yang Wenjie, an engineer from the Labor Protection Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Delin, Minister of the Labor Insurance Department of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, Ye Weimin, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the China Education Union, and Lu Kongcheng, an officer of the Organization Department of the China Petroleum Union.

### 亲身经历　新旧对比  社会主义再好不过

　　亲身经历　新旧对比
　　社会主义再好不过
    劳动模范、中国建筑工会劳保生活部副部长苏长有说：最近报纸上登了些右派分子的话，我感到很气愤，不知道他们安的什么心，借着整风向党进攻。我说：没有共产党就没有新中国。拿我自己的历史来说吧：在旧社会，我披着麻袋要饭吃，十三岁学瓦工，曾被日本鬼子从四节高的架子上打下来，好玄没摔死。这就是国民党、蒋介石卖国的结果，使中国人受尽了亡国奴的罪。日本投降后，那时我在铁岭，国民党不但不建设，还到处扒房子，泥瓦匠没有活做，一天吃不了一顿饱饭，眼看全家就要饿死，一次我想到山坡上挖树根来卖钱糊口，那知被国民党兵抓住，打的我遍体是伤，打折了肋条。我回家后全家老少都在大眼瞪小眼的等着吃饭。这就是国民党时期老百姓的生活。有了共产党，我和所有的工人一样，才做了新社会的主人，生活变了样。1949年，我在本溪煤铁公司参加了工作以后，学习了苏联先进经验，当了劳动模范。1951年参加了北京国庆观礼。1952年又到苏联、波兰参加观礼。后来又被送到工农速成中学学习，一字不识的穷孩子，现在有了初中文化程度。1954年，我又被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。工人真是当家作主了，这在中国历史上是从未有过的事，最近我又有机会以全国人民代表大会代表和劳保生活部副部长的身份到祖国各地视察农民和建筑工人的生活状况。许多活生生的事实，证明那些反党言论是胡说八道。在东北我访问了鞍山附近的新村农业社，那里住的四百户农民，在旧社会是吃不饱穿不暖的贫雇农，如今不但吃的饱，穿的好，妇女们穿上了花衣服，好多户并有了缝纫机和收音机。我们走了许多村子，都类似这种情况。
    再说我们建筑工人。在旧社会，泥水匠被看成是下贱人，生产、生活、生命都没保障。终年吃不饱，穿的补丁罗补丁。一把瓦刀，一个破的捆不成个的行李卷，就是全部家底。一天干十三、四个钟头的活，常常累伤，被打伤、摔死，没人管。吉林小丰满有个万人坑，死到里边的都是建筑工人。一到冬天泥水匠就走头无路了。
    解放后，建筑业被提到国家建设的重要地位，建筑工人的生产和生活都变了样。生产上，国家公布了保证工人健康和安全的法令的规定，有了各种劳动保护用品和设备；生活上，实行了劳动保险待遇，生、老、病、残、死都有了保障。解放前建筑工人光盖房子，自己住不着新房子。解放后，仅在第一个五年计划的前四年，国家就给建筑工人建筑了几千万平方公尺的住宅。去年工资改革，建筑工人的工资增加了13％。怎么能说提高生活的都是党员和干部呢？
    叫工人和农民来说，社会主义再好不过了，因为社会主义给我们带来了好生活，社会主义还将给我们带来更好的生活。我们建筑工人对这一点看得最清。我们亲手盖起了无数的工厂、宿舍、机关、学校、医院。也亲眼看见工人、农民、老百姓和我们建筑工人，从破漏的房子里搬进了新盖的住宅。可是葛佩琦之流，却借人民的名义，要推翻共产党，要共产党下台，不要社会主义。我们要问，叫共产党下台，叫谁上台呢？我们决不许可那些别有用心的人，借整风的机会，向党进攻，打算在中国恢复剥削人的旧社会制度。
    在会上发言的，还有全国总工会劳动保护部工程师杨文杰、中国邮电工会劳动保险部部长李德林、中国教育工会宣传部副部长叶维民、中国石油工会组织部干事吕孔成。
