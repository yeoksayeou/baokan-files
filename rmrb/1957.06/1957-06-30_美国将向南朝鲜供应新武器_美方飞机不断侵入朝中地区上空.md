Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Washington - According to Xinhua News Agency, Syngman Rhee's "ambassador" to the United States, Liang Yuzhan, held talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson on the 28th, demanding that the United States provide "more modern weapons" to arm the South Korean army. He specifically requested more jet aircraft, modern artillery, and missiles capable of launching conventional bomb-type atomic bombs.

On the same day, officials of the Syngman Rhee clique said that the United States had formally notified Syngman Rhee that it would begin supplying new weapons to South Korea. These officials said that, according to the plan to modernize the South Korean army, the United States would ship seventy-five Saber jet fighters, the latest artillery, electronic communications equipment, and other new weapons to South Korea.

On the same day, the United States dispatched new jet aircraft from bases in Japan to fly over South Korea in a show of force. Four F-00 type jet fighters flew over Seoul at noon. In the evening, six twin-engine B-57 jet bombers roared over Seoul.

The U.S. Air Force authorities issued a statement saying that the various types of new aircraft currently used by the U.S. Fifth Air Force based in Japan will now or in the future fly over South Korea and use South Korean air routes. However, the statement said that these aircraft will use South Korean bases when "training requires" it.

Local people in Seoul believe that these new aircraft will use the airbases in South Korea after the appropriate equipment is in place.

In addition, according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: At the meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission on the 28th, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side condemned the U.S. side's military aircraft for constantly violating the Armistice Agreement recently, crossing the Military Demarcation Line and intruding into the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side, and demanded that the U.S. side investigate this and take corresponding measures in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

The incidents of U.S. military aircraft repeatedly violating the Armistice Agreement raised by the Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side at the meeting included: At about 8:30 on May 22, four U.S. military jet aircraft intruded into the airspace over Lishi-ri in the Korean-Chinese side, circled once and flew back to the U.S. side; on June 24 alone, sixteen U.S. military aircraft in four batches intruded into the airspace over Anxia, Gaoyan Mountain, and Pingkang in the Korean-Chinese side; in addition, on June 25, nine U.S. military propeller aircraft in three batches intruded into the airspace over the Anxia, Gaoyan Mountain, and Pingkang region of the Korean-Chinese side.

　　美国将向南朝鲜供应新武器
    美方飞机不断侵入朝中地区上空
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：华盛顿消息：李承晚集团驻美国的“大使”梁裕灿28日同美国助理国务卿罗伯逊举行会谈，要求美国给予“更现代化的武器”，来武装南朝鲜的军队。他特别要求更多的喷气飞机、现代化的大炮和能够发射常规炸弹式原子弹的导弹。
    同一天，李承晚集团的官员说，美国已经正式通知李承晚，它将开始把新式武器供给南朝鲜。这些官员说，根据使南朝鲜军队现代化的计划，美国将要运给南朝鲜七十五架佩刀式喷气战斗机、最新式大炮、电子通讯设备和其他新式武器。
    同一天，美国从日本基地派遣新式喷气飞机飞入南朝鲜上空示威。四架F—○○型喷气式战斗机在中午飞到汉城上空。傍晚，六架双引擎的B五七型喷气轰炸机又从汉城上空呼啸而过。
    美国空军当局发表声明说，以日本为基地的美国第五航空队目前使用的各种类型的新飞机现在或者将来都将在南朝鲜上空飞行和利用南朝鲜的航空路线。但是声明说，这些飞机将在“训练需要”时使用南朝鲜的基地。
    汉城当地人士认为，在南朝鲜的空军基地具备合适的设备以后，这些新式飞机就要使用它们。
    另据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：在28日举行的军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长谴责美方军用飞机最近不断违反停战协定，越过军事分界线侵入朝中方面地区上空，并且要求美方对此进行调查，根据停战协定的规定采取相应的措施。
    朝中方面秘书长在会议上提出的美方军用飞机多次违反停战协定的事件包括：5月22日八时三十分许，美方军用喷气式飞机四架侵入朝中方面地区的栗石里上空，盘旋一周后飞回美方地区；仅在6月24日这一天中，就有美方军用飞机十六架次分四批侵入朝中方面地区的安峡、高岩山、平康地区上空；另外，在6月25日，又有美方军用螺旋桨飞机九架次分三批侵入朝中方面地区上空。
