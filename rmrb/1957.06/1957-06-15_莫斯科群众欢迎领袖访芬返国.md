Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: TASS reports: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Khrushchev, after completing a week-long friendly visit to Finland at the invitation of the Finnish government, returned to Moscow by train on June 14th.

A mass rally with 35,000 people participating was held in the square near the train station. Bulganin and Khrushchev each spoke at the rally.

Bulganin said, "In our talks with Finnish government officials, we confirmed that our two countries share the same views on a number of important international issues of great significance to the maintenance of international peace and security. As Finnish government officials have said, Finland, being outside the major power blocs, will strive to promote harmony and mutual understanding among the people of all countries in the world, especially among the people of the Nordic region."

Khrushchev said that the friendship between the Soviet Union and Finland is constantly growing and strengthening, and this friendship has brought good results to both the Soviet Union and Finland. Khrushchev expressed deep gratitude for the precious gift presented by the Finnish government and people - locomotive number 293. In the past, Lenin took this locomotive to Finland to take refuge from Kerensky's persecution, and later in October 1917, he took this locomotive back to revolutionary Petrograd.

　　莫斯科群众欢迎领袖访芬返国
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫应邀在芬兰进行了为时一周的友好访问后，已经在14日乘火车回到莫斯科。
    在车站附近的广场上举行了一个有三万五千人参加的群众大会。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在会上分别讲了话。
    布尔加宁说，我们在同芬兰政府人士的谈话中证实了，在若干对维护国际和平和安全具有重大意义的重要国际问题上，我们两国的观点是一致的。正如芬兰政府人士所说，处在大国集团之外的芬兰将努力促进世界各国人民，首先是北欧地区各国人民之间的和睦和互相谅解。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏芬两国之间的友谊正在不断增长和巩固，这种友谊不论对苏联或者芬兰都带来了良好的成果。赫鲁晓夫表示深深感谢芬兰政府和人民所赠送的珍贵礼物——二九三号机车。当年列宁为了躲避克伦斯基的迫害，曾经乘这辆机车去芬兰避难，后来在1917年10月又乘这辆机车回到了革命的彼得堡。
