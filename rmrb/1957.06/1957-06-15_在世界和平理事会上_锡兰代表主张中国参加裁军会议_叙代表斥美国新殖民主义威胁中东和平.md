At the World Peace Council
　　Ceylon Representative Advocates for China's Participation in Disarmament Conference
　　Syrian Representative Denounces US Neo-colonialism as Threatening Middle East Peace

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 14th: At the World Peace Council plenary session on the morning of June 13th, Ceylon representative Perera said that the People's Republic of China should be invited to "participate in all disarmament conferences." He said: "It is unimaginable that any difficult problems encountered in the Eastern Hemisphere could be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China; and, in terms of conventional armaments alone, it is wishful thinking to achieve genuine disarmament without the active participation of the People's China."

Perera advocated restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. His speech was warmly welcomed.

Norwegian representative Karl Bondevik also demanded the restoration of People's China's seat in the United Nations and expressed complete agreement with Guo Moruo's speech on June 11th.

Archbishop Nikolai of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic was participating in an international peace conference for the first time. This Eastern Orthodox bishop, wearing a solemn white robe and with long silver beard flowing, said: "In the struggle for peace, God is always with us, and the conscience of the people of the world is also with us."

Democratic Germany representative Kukhoff guaranteed that the German people fully support peace and oppose war. He said: "We Germans have experienced the untold disasters brought about by the fascist war." He demanded that the West German authorities respond to the Democratic German government's call for negotiations.

The afternoon session on June 13th began at 17:00, with more than a dozen representatives scheduled to speak on the agenda. The large Burmese delegation led by the eighty-year-old Dechin Godo Mai – the oldest representative attending the meeting – had already arrived in Colombo, and representatives from Egypt, Greece, Congo and Uruguay had also arrived.

To date, representatives from sixty-eight countries have participated in this World Peace Council meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 13th: Dr. Musli, member of the World Peace Council and Director of the Geographical Institute of Damascus University, Syria, said on the morning of June 13th at the continued plenary session of the Council that the United States' pressure and interference in the Middle East is the main threat to the peace of Arab countries, especially Syria.

He said that after the failure of the old colonialist war of aggression against Egypt, the United States' neo-colonialism infiltrated the Middle East in the form of the Eisenhower Doctrine and the so-called filling of the vacuum.

He said that some Arab countries that have accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine have become US military bases. He said: "Confusion, discord and division are being created among Arab countries."

The Syrian professor said amidst thunderous applause: "All aggressors, whoever they may be, must be condemned, and colonialism and imperialism must be cursed by those who truly uphold peace."

He said that Arab countries attach great importance to the Colombo meeting because it is the first international peace gathering since the war of aggression against Egypt. The Arab people love peace, but they are often subjected to aggression. The atrocities committed by invaders from Israel, Britain, and France against Egyptian civilians can only be compared to the atrocities of the Nazis.

　　在世界和平理事会上
　　锡兰代表主张中国参加裁军会议
　　叙代表斥美国新殖民主义威胁中东和平
    据新华社科伦坡14日电　在6月13日上午的世界和平理事会全体会议上，锡兰代表佩雷拉说，应该邀请中华人民共和国“参加一切裁军会议”。他说：“不可想像，没有中华人民共和国的参加，东半球所遇到的任何困难问题会得到解决；并且，仅就常规军备而言，如果没有人民中国的积极参加，想做到真正的裁军也是妄想。”
    佩雷拉主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。他的发言受到热烈欢迎。
    挪威代表卡尔·波尼维也要求恢复人民中国在联合国中的席位，并且表示完全同意郭沫若在6月11日的发言。
    俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国代表尼古拉大主教是初次参加国际间的和平会议。这位穿着庄严的白袍、飘着银色长髯的东正教主教说：“在争取和平这方面，上帝永远同我们在一起，全世界人民的良心也同我们在一起。”
    民主德国代表库克霍夫保证德国人民全力拥护和平和反对战争。他说：“我们德国人经历过法西斯战争所带来的说不完的灾难。”他要求西德当局响应民主德国政府关于进行谈判的呼吁。
    6月13日下午的会议从十七时开始，议程上要求发言的代表有十几个人。由八十岁高龄的德钦哥都迈——他是参加会议的代表中年龄最高的代表——率领的庞大的缅甸代表团已经到科伦坡，埃及、希腊、刚果和乌拉圭的代表也已经到达。
    到此为止，已经有六十八国的代表参加这次世界和平理事会会议。
    据新华社科伦坡13日电　世界和平理事会理事、叙利亚大马士革大学地理研究所所长穆斯利博士6月13日上午在理事会继续举行全体会议时说，美国对中东地区的压力和干涉是对阿拉伯国家、特别是叙利亚的和平的主要威胁。
    他说，在对埃及发动的旧殖民主义侵略战争遭到失败以后，美国的新殖民主义以艾森豪威尔主义和所谓填补真空的方式渗入了中东。
    他说，有些接受了艾森豪威尔主义的阿拉伯国家已经变成美国的军事基地。他说：“阿拉伯国家中间的混乱、不和及分裂正在制造中。”
    这位叙利亚教授在如雷的掌声中说：“一切侵略者，不论他是谁，都必须遭到谴责，殖民主义和帝国主义必须遭到真正拥护和平的人们的诅咒。”
    他说，阿拉伯国家非常重视科伦坡会议，因为这次会议是自从对埃及发动侵略战争以来第一次国际和平集会。阿拉伯人民爱好和平，但是他们常常受到侵略。以色列、英国和法国等国侵入者对埃及平民所犯下的暴行只能和纳粹分子的暴行相比。
