Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: Many professors and associate professors at the Renmin University of China today stated that they would enhance their class consciousness in the political struggle against right-wing elements. Today, they gathered for the third time to refute Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou's anti-Party and anti-socialist statements.

	Professor Yang Xuetong, an expert in living standards, refuted the fallacies of Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou with many specific figures. He said: Ge Peiqi said that people would not sell out their country even without the Communist Party, but history tells us that the 267 international treaties signed between China and other countries from 1840 to 1935 were all treaties of national betrayal, and the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty signed later was the most thorough treaty of national betrayal. Only the treaties signed by China under the leadership of the Communist Party are equal and mutually beneficial. Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou repeatedly said that "people's living standards have declined" and "the policy of unified purchase and supply has been messed up." I have done some research on price indices. Taking 1936-1937 as 100, the wholesale price index in North China was 7.25 million times higher before the Gold Yuan notes of August 1948, and rose to 316.667 million times higher by the eve of liberation. However, since liberation, if we take March 1950 as 100, it was only 94% in 1956, and prices have remained basically stable from 1956 to the present. Yang Xuetong said: I study numbers and am interested in numbers. May I ask Wang Dezhou: You believe that more than 90% of Communist Party members are engaged in sectarianism and even commit all kinds of evils, that vegetables have risen by 60% to 70% compared to last year, and that 70% of democratic parties have not played a supervisory role. Where did these figures come from? What is your basis?

	Sun Jiaxiang, a lecturer in the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office, said: Ge Peiqi believes that the relationship between the Party and the masses today is ten thousand and eight thousand miles worse than before liberation. He and Wang Dezhou slandered that "the policy of unified purchase and supply has been messed up" and "people's living standards have declined," but they kept talking about tofu and pork. Sun Jiaxiang cited the many achievements the country has made in industrial construction over the years, saying: Haven't they seen the truly independent country built under the leadership of the Party and the many good things that have been done? From this, it can be seen from what standpoint Ge Peiqi is speaking. Only people who hold his kind of standpoint are ten thousand and eight thousand miles away from the Party. I study history. Ge Peiqi said that people would not sell out their country without the Communist Party, but historical facts clearly show that "people" will sell out their country. The Manchu Qing government not only ceded land and paid indemnities, and sold out sovereignty, but also sold Chinese people to imperialists as slaves. The thief of the country Yuan Shikai sold out the country, the Northern Warlords sold out the country, the Kuomintang reactionaries sold out the Northeast, made North China special, passively resisted during the War of Resistance, and now Chiang Kai-shek continues to sell out the country in Taiwan. Sun Jiaxiang became more and more excited as he spoke. He said, who drove away the imperialists and their running dogs? Who made China truly rich, strong, and independent? It is the Communist Party! Why didn't Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou see this? The Communist Party can carry out rectification, which precisely demonstrates the Party's strength and the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, not that "the Party has reached a time of crisis," as Wang Dezhou said. We should give these reactionary statements a merciless rebuff.

	At today's forum, many people expressed that they would enhance their class consciousness in the rectification movement and the political struggle against right-wing elements. Professor Ding Gouyin said that the problem with us senior intellectuals is that we have not truly been tempered and tested. Things in books cannot change a person's thoughts and feelings. Therefore, we must undergo testing and tempering in this movement. His speech was greeted with applause.

	Professor Dai Shiguang said: These days, I have been thinking about a question: Why are the teachers of our Renmin University so insensitive when they hear the speeches of Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou? We had doubts when we heard these statements at the time, but we did not refute them. This shows that although intellectuals have received a lot of education in the past seven years, our thinking is not 100% correct. From this, he concluded that the transformation of intellectuals is a long and arduous process. He said that they want to distinguish right from wrong and draw a clear line with right-wing elements through this rectification movement, in the process of great debate, great expression, and great blooming.

	A total of nine professors, associate professors, and lecturers spoke at today's meeting. Some people also refuted the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and others at the meeting.

### 事实战胜了诡辩　真理驳倒了谎言  人民大学教授抨击葛佩琦王德周

　　事实战胜了诡辩　真理驳倒了谎言
    人民大学教授抨击葛佩琦王德周
    新华社16日讯　中国人民大学许多教授、副教授今天表示要在反击右派分子的政治斗争中提高自己的阶级觉悟。今天他们第三次集会驳斥葛佩琦、王德周反党、反社会主义的言论。
    生活指数专家杨学通教授用许多具体的数字驳斥葛佩琦、王德周的谬论。他说：葛佩琦说没有共产党人家也不会卖国，可是历史告诉我们，1840年到1935年前中国和其他国家订立的二百六十七个国际条约都是丧权辱国的条约，而以后订立的中美商约更是最彻底的卖国条约。只有共产党领导的中国和其他国家订的条约才是平等互利的。葛佩琦、王德周口口声声说，“人民生活水平降低了”。“统购统销搞糟了”。我对物价指数还有点研究。如果拿1936年—1937年为一百，华北批发物价在1948年8月金元券前是七百二十五万倍，到解放前夕涨到三亿一千六百六十七万倍。可是解放以来，如以1950年3月为一百，1956年只为94％，1956年到现在物价基本平稳。杨学通说：我是研究数字的，对数字感兴趣，请问王德周：你认为90％以上的共产党员闹宗派，甚至无恶不作，蔬菜比去年上涨60％，70％的民主党派没有发挥监督作用，这些数字你是从哪儿来的？你的论据是什么？
    中国历史教研室讲师孙家骧说：葛佩琦认为今天党群关系比解放前差了十万八千里。他和王德周诬蔑“统购统销搞糟了”，“人民生活水平下降了”，但谈来谈去离不开豆腐和猪肉。孙家骧举出几年来国家在工业建设上的许多成就说：难道他们没有看到党领导我们建成了一个真正独立的国家和所做的许多好事吗？从这里可以看出，葛佩琦是站在什么立场上讲话的，只是持有他这种立场的人才和党距离十万八千里。我是研究历史的，葛佩琦说没有共产党人家不会卖国，但历史上的事实清楚说明“人家”是会卖国的。满清政府不仅割地赔款，出卖主权，并且出卖中国人民给帝国主义当奴隶，窃国大盗袁世凯卖国，北洋军阀卖国，国民党反动派出卖东北，使华北特殊化，抗战时期消极抵抗，到现在蒋介石还在台湾继续卖国。孙家骧说到这里愈说愈激动，他说，是谁赶走帝国主义及其走狗？谁使中国真正富强独立的？是共产党！葛佩琦、王德周为什么没有看到这点呢？共产党能整风，正说明党的坚强，人民民主专政的巩固，不是像王德周所说的“党已到危机的时候”了。我们应该对这些反动言论予以无情的回击。
    在今天的座谈会上，很多人都表示要在整风运动和反击右派分子的政治斗争中提高自己的阶级觉悟。丁彀音老教授说，我们高级知识分子的毛病就是没有真正受到锻炼和考验，书本上的东西不可能把一个人的思想感情改变过来的。因此我们一定要在这个运动中经受考验和锻炼。他的讲话受到大家鼓掌欢迎。
    戴世光教授说：这几天我在想这样一个问题，为什么我们人民大学的教师在听到葛佩琦、王德周的发言时感觉如此不灵呢？我们当时听了这些言论也曾经有过怀疑但没有加以反驳。这说明知识分子七年来虽然受到了很多教育，但我们的思想中还不是百分之百的正确。他由此得出了知识分子改造是一个长期艰苦的过程的结论。他说他们要通过这次整风运动，在大争大鸣大放的过程中辨明是非，和右派分子划清界限。
    在今天会上发言的教授、副教授和讲师共有九人，有些人在会上还驳斥了章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平等反党、反社会主义的言论。
