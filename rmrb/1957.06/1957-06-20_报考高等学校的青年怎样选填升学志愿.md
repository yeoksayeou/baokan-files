How Young People Applying to Universities Should Fill in Their Application Forms
Song Cheng, Deputy Director of the Office of the National University Enrollment Committee

University unified enrollment has already begun in some test areas, and most test areas will begin universal registration in the latter half of this month. How to fill in the application form is a matter of great concern to young applicants.

As everyone knows, this year's university enrollment has improved the method of selecting and filling in application forms for candidates compared to the past.

First, the candidate's application is divided into two aspects: department/major preferences and school preferences. The former requires the candidate to indicate what major they are willing to study, and the latter requires the candidate to indicate which school they are willing to study at. In the past, candidates could fill in five major preferences, and each major preference could be filled in with three school preferences. The number of major preferences was small, and the school preferences were somewhat rigidly restricted. This year, it has been changed to allow candidates to fill in twelve major preferences, and each major preference can be filled in with one school preference, combining major and school preferences. The advantage of this method is that: on the one hand, it greatly increases the number of department/major preferences, giving candidates more choices; on the other hand, it combines the candidate's major and school preferences, allowing them to flexibly express their desire for further education. Generally speaking, candidates have roughly two situations when considering their application preferences. One is that they are mainly focused on the school preference and are willing to study at certain schools, while the department/major preference is secondary. The other is that they are mainly focused on the department/major preference and are willing to study these majors, while which school they study at is relatively secondary. According to this method, candidates can freely fill in their application forms according to their own circumstances. They can fill in twelve different majors and twelve different schools (this is the maximum limit), or they can fill in many different majors in the same school or different schools for the same major. This undoubtedly further accommodates the wishes of the candidates.

Second, department/major preferences can be filled in more carefully. This change is mainly in the field of engineering. In the past few years, engineering was filled in according to fifteen major categories, namely geological exploration, mining, metallurgy, power, machine manufacturing, and tool manufacturing, etc. It should be said that this is relatively broad, because one major category includes many majors. For example, the machine manufacturing and tool manufacturing category includes thirty-eight different types of majors, which train design and process personnel for the design and manufacture of machines, equipment, tools, instruments, and various metal parts necessary for various industrial sectors. Filling in the application form by category, and then having the school assign the major after enrollment, often differs greatly from the candidate's ideas when filling in the application form, affecting the establishment and consolidation of professional thinking. This year, the change to filling in the application form according to the departments of each school (individual cases according to the major) is more detailed and specific, which is convenient for candidates to fill in the application form; because the number of majors included in each department is small, and the majors in the same department are roughly similar in nature, this can better accommodate the wishes of the candidates. Some people ask why not fill in the application form according to the major? This is because there are many majors in engineering (more than one hundred and eighty), and if the application form is filled in according to the major, there will be more disadvantages than advantages for both the school and the candidates. On the school side, when enrolling new students, because majors cannot be adjusted between each other, some majors will not be able to recruit enough students. On the candidate side, due to the excessive refinement of majors and the small number of students enrolled in each major, candidates filling in the application form according to the major will increase the blindness in the unified enrollment, and the chances of being admitted will be reduced. Therefore, it is more appropriate to fill in the application form according to the department in engineering.

Third, this year universities generally do not adopt the method of planned allocation for enrolling new students. Candidates are required to fill in the application form truthfully, and admission is considered according to the filled-in preferences. Schools that cannot enroll the full number of students according to the candidate's filled-in preferences will adopt the method of soliciting preferences from candidates or holding another enrollment examination to complete the enrollment task.

Obviously, all these improved measures for selecting and filling in application forms will further accommodate the wishes of the candidates.

So, what is the relationship between the candidate's selection of preferences and whether they are admitted?

We know that university enrollment is an extremely complex task. Various factors must be considered during admission, including the candidate's qualifications, their preferences, regional allocation, the specific requirements of each school and major, the implementation of various policies, and attention to various relationships, etc. Whether a candidate is admitted and where they are admitted is a decision that requires repeated consideration by the relevant schools. From the perspective of the relationship between the candidate's selection of preferences and whether they are admitted, generally speaking, we consider whether to admit candidates based on their test scores, according to the order of the preferences filled in by the candidate themselves. That is, to select candidates who are basically qualified in terms of politics, health, and test scores, and classify the candidates' application forms into three major categories: science and engineering, agriculture and medicine, and liberal arts and history, and rank them in order of their test scores, from highest to lowest. Then, one by one, from front to back, according to the major and school preferences filled in by the candidates themselves, the preferred school considers whether to admit them. If the first-preference school believes that they can be admitted, then the first-preference school will admit them. If the first-preference school does not admit them, then they will be transferred to the second, third, and even twelfth-preference schools in order to consider whether to admit them. When universities consider admitting candidates who have applied to their schools, they must weigh and compare these candidates, and follow the principle of selecting the best to admit new students with higher quality. From this, it can be seen that university enrollment is based on the candidate's test scores and considers whether to admit them according to the order of their filled-in preferences. Generally speaking, the better the test scores of the candidate, the more likely they are to be admitted according to their preferences and enter the desired school and major. This is a fair and reasonable competition among candidates.

Some people ask, if candidate A's first preference and candidate B's third preference are the same school, and candidate B's test scores are better than candidate A's, then should candidate A be considered for admission first, or candidate B? We say that according to the above-mentioned admission principles, if candidate B has not been admitted by the first and second preference schools, when comparing candidate B with candidate A at the third preference school, candidate B should be considered for admission first; because candidate B's scores are better, candidate B should be considered for admission first. Of course, this is in the simplest situation. In actual work, it is necessary to specifically analyze the specific conditions of candidate A and candidate B. Assuming that the scores of candidate A and candidate B are not much different, and although candidate B's total score in each subject is higher than candidate A's, their math, physics, and chemistry scores are not as good as candidate A's. At this time, schools of engineering and science may consider admitting candidate A first, instead of candidate B. For example, if candidate B's health is not as good as candidate A's, the relevant school may consider this and admit candidate A instead of candidate B. However, in any case, it is certain that candidates with better test scores are more likely to be admitted.

Some people ask, are the admission standards of each university the same? We say that they are basically the same, but there are also some differences. The so-called basically the same means that any school must follow what is said in the enrollment regulations: they should strive to implement the policy of ensuring quality and completing the plan, and select new students with better quality in terms of politics, health, and academic performance. The so-called difference means that, on the one hand, the requirements for candidates' health conditions and test scores in each subject are not the same for each major. For example, engineering schools require candidates to have a better foundation in mathematics and physics, and the architecture department also requires candidates to have certain sketching skills. Liberal arts schools require candidates to have good scores in Chinese and political common sense, which is very necessary. On the other hand, due to school conditions, historical traditions, candidates' understanding, and various other reasons, the number of candidates applying for each school, and even each department and major in a school, is very unbalanced. Some schools have as many as tens of thousands of applicants, while others have only dozens. In this way, the water rises and the boat floats higher. Those schools and majors with a large number of applicants will naturally have higher admission standards.

Some people also ask, can candidates who are basically qualified in terms of politics, health, and test scores be guaranteed to be admitted? Generally speaking, these candidates have more opportunities to be admitted, but not all of them can be admitted. This year, the method of planned allocation has been cancelled. If the preferences they select are not truthful and are too concentrated on certain schools and majors, and are not up to the admission standards of the preferred schools and majors, they will not be admitted even if they generally meet the admission requirements. At this time, they can only wait for the opportunity to re-select preferences and re-select preferences among the schools that have not yet reached their quota. As to whether they can be admitted, it is necessary for the schools where they re-select preferences to review and determine according to the principle of selecting the best.

From the above discussion of selecting preferences and the relationship between preferences and admission, it is very important for young people applying to universities to select preferences in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and with an honest attitude. That is to say, they must consider their own academic level, health conditions, etc. For example, if a young person has a better foundation in mathematics and physics, they are more suitable for selecting major preferences in science and engineering. Selecting a major that they are suitable for studying is not only easier to be admitted, but also more convenient to study after being admitted. Conversely, if their foundation in mathematics and physics is poor, but they blindly select major preferences in science and engineering, they will have fewer chances of being admitted. The same is true for their own health conditions. If, after a health check, they are deemed unsuitable for studying the major they originally applied for, they should change their preferences. In order to facilitate the selection of preferences, we hope that everyone can refer to the "Application Guidance" and the "Candidate Handbook" compiled by local enrollment agencies to fully understand the content of each major, the department and major settings of universities, and the regional scope of enrollment of each school. Only by understanding them can they correctly select preferences. We also hope that everyone will appropriately disperse the major and school preferences they select when selecting preferences, do not over-concentrate on certain schools and majors, and fill in as many major and school preferences as possible to strive for more opportunities to be admitted. This is not only beneficial to the candidates, but also beneficial to the enrollment work of universities.

　　报考高等学校的青年怎样选填升学志愿
　　全国高等学校招生委员会办公室副主任　宋诚
    高等学校统一招生，有的考区已经开始报名了，多数考区在本月下旬也要普遍报名了。怎样选填升学志愿，是报考青年目前十分关心的问题。
    大家知道，今年高等学校招生，对于考生选填志愿办法，比较以往有了改进。
    第一，考生报考志愿分两个方面，即系科专业志愿和学校志愿，前者是要考生表明愿意学习什么专业的，后者是要考生表明愿意到什么学校学习的。以往规定考生可以选填五个专业志愿，每一个专业志愿选填三个学校志愿，专业志愿较少同时对于学校志愿，多少有些硬性地限制。今年则改为可以选填十二个专业志愿，每一个专业志愿可以选填一个学校志愿，专业志愿和学校志愿相结合。这个办法的好处是：一方面大大增加了系科专业志愿数目，使考生有较多的选择机会；一方面使考生的专业志愿和学校志愿结合起来，能够灵活地表达自己的升学愿望。一般地说，考生在考虑升学志愿问题时，大致有两种情况，一种是以学校志愿为主，愿意到某些学校去学习，至于系科专业志愿是次要的；一种是以系科专业志愿为主，愿意学习这些专业，到什么学校去学习是比较次要的。按照这个办法，考生可以根据自己的情况自由地选填志愿，他可以选填十二个不同专业和十二个不同学校的志愿（这是就规定的最大限度说的），也可以选填同一学校的许多不同的专业或同一专业的不同学校志愿。这样，无疑地是进一步地照顾了考生的志愿。
    第二，可以更加细致地选填系科专业志愿。这种改变主要是在工科方面。过去几年，工科是按十五个大类，即地质勘探、采矿、冶金、动力、机器制造和工具制造等等填写的；应该说这是比较笼统的，因为一个专业类包括很多专业，像机器制造和工具制造类，就包括三十八个不同性质的专业，来培养设计和制造各工业部门所必需的机器、设备、工具和仪器以及各种金属零件的设计和工艺人材的；按类填写志愿，入学后再由学校分配专业，往往和考生填写志愿时候的想法距离很大，影响专业思想的树立和巩固。今年改为按各校的系选填志愿（个别的按专业），就比较细致具体，便利考生选填；因为每一个系中包括的专业数目较少，同一个系里的各个专业性质大体上是相类似的，这样，就能够更好地照顾考生的志愿。有人问，为什么不都按专业选填志愿呢，这是由于工科的专业数目很多（有一百八十多个），如一律接照专业选填志愿，对学校和考生都弊多利少，在学校方面，在录取新生时，因为专业之间无法调剂，会有一部分专业招不足学生；在考生方面，由于专业过细，每一专业招生的人数较小，考生按专业填报志愿，在统一招生的情况下，盲目性会增大，被录取的机会就要减少。所以工科按系选填志愿，是较为恰当的。
    第三，今年高等学校录取新生，一般不采取计划分配的办法。要求考生要实事求是地选填志愿，录取时按所填志愿考虑录取，接照考生所填志愿不能录取满额的学校，则采取向考生征求志愿或者再次举行招生考试的办法来完成招生任务。
    十分明显，所有这些选填志愿的改进措施，必将使考生的升学志愿得到进一步的照顾。
    那么，考生选填志愿与以后录取与否的关系怎样呢？
    我们知道，高等学校录取新生，是一件极其复杂的工作。在录取的时候要考虑到各种因素，要注意考生的条件，也要照顾他们的志愿，要注意地区间的调配，也要注意各学校、专业的具体要求，要贯彻各项政策，注意各种关系，等等。一个考生是否被录取，录取到那里，是要经过有关学校再三考虑才能决定的。单从考生选填志愿与录取与否的关系来看，一般说，我们是在每个考生考试成绩好坏的基础上，接照考生本人所填志愿的顺序，由有关学校逐次考虑录取与否的。就是把政治、健康、考试成绩基本上合格的考生挑选出来，根据考生的报考类别，将考生的申请报考书分理工、农医、文史三大类，各按他们考试成绩分数的高低顺次排队，分数高的在前面，分数低的在后面；然后再一个个地从前到后，按照考生自己所填的专业志愿和学校志愿，由志愿的学校考虑录取与否；倘若第一志愿学校认为可以录取，就由第一志愿的学校录取，第一志愿学校不录取时，再顺次交由第二、第三以至第十二志愿的学校去考虑录取与否；高等学校在考虑录取志愿报考它们学校的考生时，是要把这些考生权衡比较，要根据择优录取的原则，以录取质量较高的新生的。由此可见，高等学校录取新生，是在每个考生考试成绩好坏的基础上，按照他们所填志愿顺序考虑录取与否的。一般说，考试成绩愈优越的考生，愈有可能按志愿被录取，进入志愿的学校、专业。这是考生之间的一种公正合理的竞争。
    有人问，甲乙两个考生，甲第一志愿乙第三志愿同为某校，而乙比甲的考试成绩要好，那么，是先考虑录取甲，还是乙？我们说，按上述录取原则，乙如果未被第一第二志愿学校录取，在第三志愿学校与甲比较起来，应该先考虑录取乙；因为乙的成绩好，应该先考虑录取乙。当然，这是就最简单的情况来说的，在实际工作中，还要具体地分析甲、乙的具体条件，假定在甲乙两人成绩相差无几，乙虽比甲的考试成绩各科总分为高，但是他的数、理、化成绩却不如甲，这时工科、理科的学校就可能先考虑录取甲，而不取乙；又譬如乙健康状况不如甲，有关的学校考虑到这一点，也可能录取甲，而不录取乙。但是，无论如何，考试成绩愈优越的考生，愈有可能被录取，这是肯定的。
    有人问，各个高等学校的录取水平是不是一样的呢？我们说，基本上相同，但是也有所不同。所谓基本上相同，是指任何学校都要按照招生规定上所说的：应该努力贯彻保证质量，完成计划的方针，要从政治、健康、学业三方面选择录取质量较好的新生入学；所谓有所不同，是说一方面各个专业对考生的健康条件、各科考试成绩的要求不甚相同，譬如，工科的学校，要求考生数、理基础要好一些，其中建筑系还要求考生有一定的素描的技能；文科的学校则要求考生语文政治常识的成绩要好，这是十分必要的；另一方面，由于学校条件、历史传统、考生的认识种种原因，各个学校，甚至一个学校的各个系科专业之间，考生报考人数是很不平衡的，有的学校多到几万人，有的只有几十人，这样，水涨船高，多中取好，那些报考人数较多的学校、专业，录取结果，水平自然就要高些。
    也有人问，政治、健康、考试成绩基本上合格的考生是否一定能够被录取呢？一般来说，这些考生是有较多的录取机会的，但并不个个都能录取。今年取消了计划分配的办法，如果他们选填的志愿不实事求是，过于集中报考某些学校、专业，又不够志愿学校、专业录取水平时，就是一般够录取条件也不可能被录取。这时候他们只有等待重新选填志愿的机会，来就尚未足额的学校中重新选填志愿，至于是否能够录取，需经他们重新选填志愿的学校根据择优录取的原则，来审查确定。
    从上面所谈选填志愿和志愿与录取与否的关系看来，报考高等学校的青年应该本着实事求是的精神，老老实实的态度，去选填升学志愿是非常重要的。就是说要考虑自己的学科水平、健康条件等等，譬如，有一个青年，他的数理基础较好，他就比较适宜选填理工科方面的专业志愿；选填自己适合学习的专业，不但容易被录取，而且考取之后学习起来也比较方便；相反，如果他的数理基础较差，却盲目地选填理工科方面的专业志愿，则被录取的机会就会较少。同样，对待自己的健康条件也是如此，如果经过健康检查，认为不适宜学习原来志愿报考的专业时，就应该更改志愿。为了便于选填志愿，我们希望大家能够参考一下“升学指导”和各地招生机构编印的“考生手册”，全面了解各个专业的内容、高等学校的系科、专业设置情况和各校招生的地区范围，只有了解了它们，才能正确地选填志愿。我们还希望大家在选填升学志愿时，把自己所选填的专业和学校志愿适当分散一些，不要过份集中某些学校、专业，并且尽可能地多选填一些专业和学校志愿，争取有更多的被录取机会。这不仅有利于考生，也有利于高等学校的招生工作。
