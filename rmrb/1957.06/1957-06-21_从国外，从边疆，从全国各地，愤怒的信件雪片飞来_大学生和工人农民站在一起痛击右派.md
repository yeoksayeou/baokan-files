　　From Abroad, From the Borderlands, From All Over the Country, Angry Letters Fall Like Snowflakes
    University Students Stand Together with Workers and Peasants to Vigorously Repudiate the Rightists
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) More and more university students are writing to this newspaper expressing their determination to stand with the workers, peasants, and other working people, and to strive to repel the attacks of the rightist elements. From June 10th to 20th, this newspaper received a total of 7,994 letters from readers refuting the fallacies of the rightists, including more than 800 letters from university students in various regions. These letters, filled with the youthful students' intense anger, came from all parts of the motherland. Besides letters from students of various universities in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, there were also letters from students of Sichuan University, Chongqing Southwest University of Political Science and Law, Northwest University, Northwest Institute of Technology, Shaanxi Normal College, Northeast People's University, Northeast Institute of Technology, Northeast Agricultural College, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Foreign Language Institute, Jiangxi Medical College, Guangxi Normal College, Shandong University, Zhejiang Medical College, Shanxi Medical College, Inner Mongolia Normal College, Hebei Agricultural College, Hebei Medical College, Tangshan Railway Institute, and other institutions of higher learning. Many of these letters from university students were collectively signed. For example, one letter from the Northeast Conservatory of Music had over 130 student signatures, one letter from the third grade of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University had 80 student signatures, and one letter from Tsinghua University had 23 student signatures. In addition to denouncing the fallacies of Ge Peiqi, Wang Dezhou, Chu Anping, Yang Yuqing, and others, these letters refuted the statements of rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun and Wang Zunyi. Especially after Shi Liang exposed Zhang Bojun's double-dealing tactics at a meeting of the China Democratic League Central Committee group, university students became even more indignant. Students who were busy preparing for exams also squeezed out time to write to this newspaper; those who had already written letters questioned this newspaper as to why their letters had not been published. A letter from the first class of the first grade of the Archives Department of Renmin University of China, signed by "Nineteen University Students," stated that from the facts revealed in the recent newspapers, it could be seen that the statements of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and others were an organized and consistent attack on the Party. They attempted to abolish the Party's leadership and overthrow the people's democratic regime. Many letters specifically analyzed the "Political Design Institute" and "Upper House" proposed by Zhang Bojun, and pointed out incisively that this was an attempt to drag the Chinese people from the socialist road back into the abyss of capitalism, which the people would never allow. Zheng Wenhui of Tsinghua University questioned Zhang Bojun's mention of "historical figures" in his letter: the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng had long been spurned by the people, and Chu Anping's anti-socialist statements had been denounced by the people across the country, but Zhang Bojun considered them "historical figures"; conversely, Mr. Lu Yuwen spoke out righteously, but Zhang Bojun considered him a "clown." What did this mean? Did Zhang Bojun also want to become such a historical figure?
    Many university students expressed dissatisfaction with Zhang Bojun's perfunctory self-criticism. In their letters, they said that Zhang Bojun's self-criticism was insincere, dishonest, and extremely superficial. Linking this "self-criticism" with the facts revealed by Shi Liang and others, it was not difficult to see that Zhang Bojun was continuing to play double-dealing tactics. Zhang Shouchun of Peking University raised objections in his letter to the "blurred understanding" and "liberal attitude" mentioned in Zhang Bojun's self-criticism. Hu Feng was a counter-revolutionary, and Chu Anping was a vanguard who opposed the Party, attacked the socialist cause, and "hit the nail on the head," yet Zhang Bojun secretly praised them endlessly. Was this really "blurred understanding"? Many university students disagreed with Zhang Bojun's statement in his self-criticism that he was being used by rightist elements. In fact, Zhang Bojun was a rightist element himself.
    After Wang Zunyi, a lecturer at Shaanxi Normal College, published his anti-communist statements, many university students wrote to regard it as the most vicious statement against the Communist Party and against socialism. Cheng Ruizheng and 15 others from the Central Conservatory of Music wrote that Wang Zunyi divided the Chinese people into four classes, which was by no means due to this lecturer's ignorance, but precisely exposed his anti-communist and anti-socialist stance. The university students also refuted each of the erroneous arguments in Wang Zunyi's speech forcefully. Tang Xiaofeng, a first-year student at the Beijing Russian Language Institute, wrote: I am the "fourth class" mentioned in Wang Zunyi's speech, but I have never been discriminated against or excluded by Party members or Youth League members, and therefore have never felt inferior. Tang Xiaofeng continued: The Communist Party has always educated its members to maintain close ties with the masses, and requires Party members to fulfill more obligations than the masses, rather than enjoying special rights. The facts have also proved that the vast majority of Party members are diligent, conscientious, humble, and connected to the masses. How can Party members be called special "first-class people"! Obviously, Wang Zunyi is creating division and maliciously undermining the unity of the people.
    Wang Zunyi's slander of the people's democratic system and his malicious slander of the state power were met with unanimous and severe condemnation from the students. Jiang Chengzhen and seven other students from the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University questioned Wang Zunyi: What did the Communist Party seize power for? Was it to become a first-class noble person as you said? Since the Communist Party came to power, China's international status has improved, the living standards of the working people have greatly improved, all ethnic groups have united, and unreasonable systems have been changed... Mr. Wang Zunyi, can't you see it? Can you not admit it?
    Zhang Zhengeng, who is studying at the Moscow Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold Institute in the Soviet Union, He Xiuzhang and Liu Zhongfu, who are studying at the Moscow Mining School, Wu Guoan, who is studying in Leningrad, and Zou Guochang, who is studying in Hungary, all wrote to refute the statements of the rightist elements.

### 从国外，从边疆，从全国各地，愤怒的信件雪片飞来  大学生和工人农民站在一起痛击右派

　　从国外，从边疆，从全国各地，愤怒的信件雪片飞来
    大学生和工人农民站在一起痛击右派
    本报讯　愈来愈多的大学生给本报来信表示：要和工人、农民及其他劳动人民站在一起，努力击退右派分子的进攻。从6月10日到20日，本报共收到七千九百九十四封驳斥右派分子言论的读者来信，其中有各地大学生的来信八百多封。这些充满了青年学生满腔愤怒的信件，来自祖国各地，其中除了北京、天津、上海、武汉各高等学校学生的来信以外，还有四川大学、重庆西南政法学院、西北大学、西北工学院、陕西师范学院、东北人民大学、东北工学院、东北农学院、哈尔滨工业大学、哈尔滨外国语学院、江西医学院、广西师范学院、山东大学、浙江医学院、山西医学院、内蒙古师范学院、河北农学院、河北医学院、唐山铁道学院等高等学校学生的来信。这些大学生的来信中，有许多是集体签名的。如东北音乐专科学校的一封来信有一百三十多名学生签名，北京师范大学中文系三年级一封来信有八十名学生签名，清华大学的一封来信有二十三名学生签名。这些来信除了痛斥葛佩琦、王德周、储安平、杨玉清等人的谬论以外，对章伯钧、王尊一等右派分子的言论进行了批驳。特别在史良在民盟中央小组会上揭露章伯钧的两面手法后，大学生更加愤怒。正在紧张准备考试的学生也挤出时间给本报写信；已经写过信的，来信质问本报为什么不登他们的来信。中国人民大学档案系一年级一班署名“十九名大学生”的来信说，从最近报纸上揭发的事实可以看出，章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平等人的言论，是有组织地一脉相承地向党的进攻。他们企图取消党的领导，企图推翻人民民主政权。许多来信对章伯钧提出的“政治设计院”“上议院”作了具体分析，并且一针见血地指出：这是企图把中国人民从社会主义的大道上拉回到资本主义深渊中去，这是人民万万不答应的。清华大学郑文会在来信中对章伯钧所说的“历史人物”提出了责问：反革命分子胡风早为人民所唾弃，储安平的反社会主义言论遭到了全国人民的斥责，而章伯钧认为他们是“历史人物”；相反地卢郁文先生仗义执言，章伯钧却认为他是“小丑”，这是什么意思？章伯钧是不是也想做这样的历史人物？
    对于章伯钧的空洞的检讨，许多大学生表示不满。他们在来信中说：章伯钧的检讨是不诚恳、不老实，也是极不深刻的，把这份“检讨”和史良等人揭发的事实联系起来，不难看出章伯钧是在继续玩弄两面手法。北京大学张寿春来信对章伯钧检讨中所说的“认识模糊”、“自由主义态度”的问题提出了意见。胡风是反革命分子，储安平是反对党、攻击社会主义事业、“击中了要害”的急先锋，而章伯钧在暗地里对这些人赞口不绝，这难道是“认识模糊”吗？许多大学生不同意章伯钧在检讨中说自己是被右派分子利用，其实，章伯钧就是右派分子。
    陕西师范学院讲师王尊一的反共言论发表后，许多大学生来信把它当作一篇反对共产党、反对社会主义最恶毒的言论。中央音乐学院程瑞征等十五个人来信说，王尊一把中国人民分成四等，这决不是出于这位讲师的无知，而恰恰暴露了他的反共反社会主义的立场。对王尊一发言中的各个错误论点，大学生们也逐一地进行了有力的批驳。北京俄语学院的一年级学生唐晓风来信说：我是王尊一发言中所说的“第四等人”，可是我从来没有受到过党员和团员的任何歧视和排挤，因此也从来没有低一等的感觉。唐晓风接着说：共产党一直教育自己的党员密切联系群众，要求党员比群众尽更多的义务，而不是享受特殊的权利。事实也证明了绝大多数党员是勤勤恳恳的，是谦虚的，也是联系群众的。这怎么能把党员称之为特殊的“第一等人”呢！显然，王尊一是在制造分裂，是在恶意地破坏人民内部的团结。
    王尊一对人民民主制度的诬蔑，对国家政权的恶意中伤，受到学生们一致的严厉的申斥。北京师范大学教育系学生江承桢等七人来信质问王尊一：共产党掌握政权为了什么？难道是为了像你所说的那样做一个第一等高贵的人吗？共产党掌握政权以来，中国国际地位提高了，劳动人民生活大大改善了，各民族团结了，不合理的制度改变了，……王尊一先生，你难道看不见吗？你能不承认吗？
    远在苏联莫斯科有色金属及黄金学院学习的章振根、莫斯科矿业学校学习的何秀璋和刘忠孚、在列宁格勒学习的吴国安，在匈牙利学习的邹国昌都来信驳斥右派分子的言论。
