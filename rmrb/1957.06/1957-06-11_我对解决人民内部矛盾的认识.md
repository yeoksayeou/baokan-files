My Understanding of Resolving Contradictions Among the People
Li Dequan

Since liberation, in the short span of eight years, the five major movements and three major transformations that our people across the country have carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have achieved tremendous accomplishments that are obvious to all. These achievements have firmly laid a solid foundation for our country to embark on the broad road of socialism. However, we do not deny that in the process of our rapid advancement, along with achievements, many shortcomings and errors have also emerged. These good aspects and bad aspects are both inevitable phenomena in the process of social development, and are by no means, as some individuals have recently believed, a symbol that the Party is facing a crisis. Such absurd anti-socialist remarks are simply intolerable! As the leader of the country, the Chinese Communist Party has not concealed or evaded its shortcomings and errors. When contradictions among the people once rose to become the main contradiction in social life, the Party immediately sounded the alarm for all Communist Party members, promptly put the rectification movement on the agenda, and sincerely and openly solicited opinions and listened to criticisms from all non-Party members and the broad masses of the people. This is the wisdom and greatness of the Party. A political party that dares to face up to shortcomings and errors, and is brave enough to correct shortcomings and errors to promote social development, has only existed once in Chinese history. Therefore, the main purpose of our everyone speaking out freely today to criticize the shortcomings and errors that have occurred in the work of the Chinese Communist Party and put forward reasonable suggestions is to help the Party eliminate its weaknesses and enhance its strengths, so that it can lead us in building a socialist society more perfectly and correctly in all aspects.

The formation of contradictions among the people is directly related to the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism within the Party. Some Party members with insufficient Marxist-Leninist cultivation, intoxicated with the pride of being the ruling party, have forgotten their duty to serve the people humbly, and have displayed arrogance and arbitrariness by being high above the people and issuing orders arbitrarily. This will inevitably arouse dissatisfaction among the masses of the people. Because after several years of education by the Party, the general public understands the principle of guarding against arrogance and impetuosity and serving the people wholeheartedly. Then, Communist Party members are the most advanced and conscious elements of the working class, so of course the people have high demands on them, and the people do not allow the style of being detached from the masses and detached from reality that some of them have shown to continue to develop. In order to correct this undesirable tendency, in order to better deal with and resolve contradictions among the people, the Party has proposed rectification. This is not only a profound Marxist-Leninist class education for all Communist Party members, but also a great improvement for the people of the whole country in their understanding of the principle of unity—criticism—unity.

We all know that the highest interest of the Party is the interest of the masses of the people, and the Party has no other interest besides this. Since the interests of the people and the Party are completely common and consistent, then today's resolution of contradictions among the people is by no means just a matter within the Communist Party. The formation of contradictions among the people is by no means solely caused by the Communist Party. As the saying goes, "One bowl doesn't make a sound, two bowls clang." The cause of any contradiction always lies in two or more aspects. If there are contradictions among the people today, as a member of the people, every one of us non-Party members should not only actively offer criticisms and suggestions for the work of the Party, but also examine ourselves. Therefore, today each of us has the responsibility to work together with the Party to resolve and eliminate contradictions. Party members and non-Party members should stand on the same front, overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and everyone should proceed from the principle of unity—criticism—unity, improve work, establish a good style, and resolve contradictions. This is the correct attitude we should hold. However, judging from some of the speeches published in the newspapers recently, some people are no longer standing on the position of prioritizing the interests of the people to kindly criticize the Party. They have shown an abnormal hostile attitude and have made anti-socialist cries. This attitude is completely wrong. Any conscientious Chinese person should not forget who rescued China from a fate of numerous disasters, and who led us with a resolute and indomitable patriotic spirit to break free from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, saving us from the fate of being slaves of a conquered nation. We often hear people sing "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." This is the truth. How can we imagine what China would be like today without the Communist Party? We criticize some Party members with serious shortcomings, but we cannot negate the role of the entire Party. Most of the Communist Party members, especially some of the responsible comrades of the Party, are working hard day and night for the cause of socialism. This spirit of hard work, being cautious and conscientious, and being loyal to the people's cause, is always worthy of our learning. Therefore, we should offer suggestions for the work of the Party from the standpoint of patriotism and the working people, and from the perspective of being beneficial to the socialist cause. At present, some people are attempting to attack Marxism-Leninism and the working class under the guise of opposing dogmatism, and we must oppose and expose them.

The rectification within the Party is a good start to resolving contradictions among the people. We should unite more closely around the Party, and under the leadership of the Party, jointly learn from the shortcomings and errors, improve our work, spur ourselves forward, and unswervingly struggle for the socialist cause!

　　我对解决人民内部矛盾的认识
　　李德全
    自从解放以来，在短短的八年过程中，我们全国人民在中国共产党的领导下所进行的五大运动、三大改造，已经获得了人所共睹的巨大成就，这些成就坚不可摇地奠定了我们国家走上社会主义社会大道的巩固基础。但是，我们并不否认，在我们大踏步前进的过程中，与成绩一起同时还产生了不少缺点和错误，这些好的方面和坏的方面，同为社会发展进程中的必然现象，而决不是像最近有个别人所认为的那样，把这些发展中的缺陷认做是党已面临危机的象征，这种荒谬的反社会主义言论，简直令人难以容忍！做为国家领导者的中国共产党，并没有掩饰或躲避自己的缺点和错误，当人民内部矛盾一经上升为社会生活中的主要矛盾时，党立刻向全体共产党员敲起了警钟，及时地把整风运动提到日程上来，并诚恳公开地向一切党外人士、向全国人民群众广泛征求意见，听取批评，这是党的英明和伟大。像这样敢于正视缺点和错误，勇于改正缺点和错误以推进社会发展的政党，自中国有史以来，只有一个。因此，我们每一个人今天大鸣大放，畅所欲言地对中国共产党在工作中所发生的缺点和错误提出批评与合理建议，主要的目的是在于帮助党去其短，长其长，从各方面更完善、更正确地来领导我们建设社会主义社会。
    人民内部矛盾的形成，和党内的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义是有直接关系的，一部分马列主义修养不够的党员，陶醉在自己是执政党的得意中，而忘记了谦逊地为人民服务的本分，表现出高居人上、任意发号施令的骄傲专断，这就必然会引起人民大众的不满。因为经过几年来党的教育，一般群众都明白了戒骄戒傲、忠心耿耿为人民服务的道理，那么共产党员是工人阶级中最先进、最有觉悟的分子，当然人民对他们的要求高，人民不容许他们其中一部分人所表现出的脱离群众、脱离实际的作风继续发展下去。为了纠正这种不良偏向，为了更好地处理与解决人民内部矛盾，党提出了整风，这不单对全体共产党员是一次深刻的马克思列宁主义的阶级教育，而且使全国人民在对团结——批评——团结这一原则的认识方面，也将是一个很大的提高。
    我们都知道，党的最高利益就是人民群众的利益，除此以外，党再没有第二种利益。既然人民和党的利益完全共同一致，那么今天解决人民内部的矛盾，就决不仅只是共产党内部的事，人民内部矛盾的形成，也决不单纯是由于共产党这一方面的原因所造成的，常言道：“一只碗不响，两只碗叮当”，任何矛盾的产生和发展，其原因总是双方面或多方面的。人民内部今天有了矛盾，做为人民成员的一分子，我们每一个非党人士除了应当积极给党的工作提出批评与建议外，还应该从自己本身方面来检查。所以今天我们每一个人都有责任和党共同一起来为解决与消除矛盾而努力。党内外应该站在一条战线上，克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，大家本着团结——批评——团结的原则出发，改进工作，树立优良作风，解决矛盾，这才是我们所应持的正确态度。但从最近报纸上所登载的某些发言来看，有的人已经不是站在以人民利益为重的立场上来善意地批评党了，他们表现出一种不正常的敌对态度，发出反社会主义的叫嚣，这种态度是完全错误的。任何一个有良心的中国人，首先都不应该忘记是谁从灾难重重的厄运中拯救了中国，是谁以坚毅不拔的大无畏爱国主义精神领导我们摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的桎梏，使我们免于当亡国奴的命运。我们常听见人们唱“没有共产党，就没有新中国”，这是真理。我们怎么能够设想，如果没有共产党，中国今天的局面是一个什么样子。我们批评一部分缺点严重的党员，但却不能把整个党的作用都否定了。大多数的共产党员，尤其是一些党的负责同志们，他们日夜辛苦地在为着社会主义的事业努力工作，这种战战兢兢、忠于人民事业的艰苦精神，是永远值得我们学习的。所以我们给党的工作提意见，应该是站在爱国主义和劳动人民的立场上，从对社会主义事业有利的角度出发，目前有些人企图在反对教条主义的幌子下来进攻马列主义和工人阶级，我们必须加以反对和揭露。
    党内进行整风，是解决人民内部矛盾的一个良好开端，我们应该更紧密的团结在党的周围，在党的领导下共同从缺点和错误中吸取教训，改进工作，鞭笞自己前进，为社会主义事业坚定不移地奋斗！
