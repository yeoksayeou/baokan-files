    US Exploits the Poor in Hawaii
    In 1956, Hawaii's income tax in the United States reached its peak, accounting for 21% of all tax revenue. The "Honolulu Advertiser" reported that two-thirds of this 21% was directly deducted from wages, salaries, and bonuses at a rate of 2%. The collection of income tax is extremely unreasonable. For example, a worker who earns $2,000 a year and supports six children pays the same 2% tax to the government as a company manager who earns $25,000 a year and only supports himself and his wife. Moreover, among people with the same income, the income tax levied is also different. A person with two children earning a salary of $5,000 has to pay $160 in income tax, while a landlord earning $5,000 only pays $109. Robert C. Kamins, Director of the Legislative Reference Bureau of Hawaii, also believes that such a tax system is an exploitation of the poor.

    美国在夏威夷勒索穷人
    1956年美国夏威夷的所得税已达高峰，它在全部的税收中占21％。“檀香山纪事报”报道：这21％的税收中，有三分之二是直接从工资、薪金和红利上扣除2％的税而来的。所得税的征收是极不合理的，例如一个年收二千美元工资而又抚养六个孩子的工人，和一个年收二万五千美元只供本人和妻子的公司经理，同样要向政府缴纳2％的税金。而在收入相同的人们中间，所征收的所得税也不相同。一个有两个孩子收入五千美元薪金的人，要付一百六十美元的所得税，而一个收入五千美元的地主只付一百零九美元。夏威夷的立法资料局局长罗伯特·卡明也认为，这样的税收制度是对穷人的勒索。
