　　Going to the Moon Is Not Far Off
    The Soviet Union Will Launch Rockets for Exploration in a Few Years; People Will Be Able to Travel Freely Within This Century
    Prediction by Soviet Interstellar Problem Expert
    Our Moscow dispatch on the 27th – Soviet interstellar problem expert Khlebtsevich has conducted much research in recent years on methods for going to the Moon, Mars, and Venus. He recently designed a mobile laboratory for exploring the Moon, shaped like a small tank, equipped with engines and some automated instruments, radio, and facsimile equipment.
    In an article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on the 26th, he said: It is now possible to specifically predict when we will enter outer space. Modern technology already permits the manufacturing of radio-controlled rockets that can fly to the Moon and some planets. In the coming years, mankind will launch assaults on the Moon, Mars, and Venus without waiting for the creation of habitable artificial satellites. In the early 1960s, the first batch of radio-controlled reconnaissance aircraft will explore the Moon. In the five to ten years that follow, relying on radio-controlled rockets, manned scientific research stations will be established on the Moon. By the end of the twentieth century, flights between the Earth and the Moon will be commonplace. Before the twenty-first century, the Moon will become the Earth's seventh continent, and at that time it will be possible to study the issue of utilizing the Moon's natural resources. Rockets launched to the Moon will initially not carry people, but rather tank-like laboratories controlled from the ground by radio. A single flight will only consume 250 tons of fuel. As the "small tank" moves on the Moon, it will constantly transmit facsimile photos to the ground, studying the soil, temperature, and atmospheric composition there. Similar "small tanks" can also land on Mars. That will happen between 1965 and 1971. It is estimated that there is no life on Mars and Venus. If life is discovered there, we can establish telephone and television connections with the inhabitants there.

　　到月亮上去为期不远
    苏联几年后将放出火箭探途  本世纪内人们便可来往自如
    苏联星际问题专家预测
    本报莫斯科27日电  苏联星际问题专家赫列宁采维奇最近几年对于到月亮、火星、金星去的方法作了很多研究。他不久前设计了一种探测月亮用的流动实验室，外形像小坦克，配备有发动机和一些自动化仪器、无线电和传真设备。
    他在26日的“共青真理报”上撰文说：现在已经可以具体预测我们什么时候进入宇宙空间。现代技术已经许可制造无线电遥控的火箭，它们能够飞到月亮和一些行星去。在最近年份中人类将向月亮、火星、金星突击，而不等待能住人的人造卫星的造成。在六十年代初期将有第一批无线电遥控的侦察机探测月亮。其后五年到十年，依靠无线电遥控的火箭，在月亮上将建立起带人的科学研究站。到二十世纪末，地球与月亮之间的飞行将是平常的事。在二十一世纪以前，月亮将成为地球的第七个洲，到那时就有可能研究利用月亮上的自然富源问题。向月亮放射的火箭，起初不带人，而带从地面用无线电控制的小坦克式实验室。飞行一趟只耗二百五十吨燃料。“小坦克”在月亮上运动时候，将会不断地向地面发出传真照片，将研究那里的土壤、温度和大气的成份。类似的“小坦克”也可以降落到火星上去。那将发生在1965到1971年。估计在火星、金星上没有生命。要是在那里发现生命，我们可以和那里居民建立电话和电视的联系。
