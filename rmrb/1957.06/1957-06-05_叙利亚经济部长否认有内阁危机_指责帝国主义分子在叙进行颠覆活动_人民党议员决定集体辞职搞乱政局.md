Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 4th: The latest issue of the Egyptian weekly "Rose al-Yusuf" reported that the Syrian Minister of Economy, Kalas, currently visiting Cairo, said that rumors of a cabinet crisis in Syria are untrue.

In an interview with the weekly's reporter, Kalas said that Syria is still pursuing a policy of liberation and Arab unity. The current cabinet will continue to govern until the end of the parliamentary term.

He said that various imperialist elements are putting pressure on Syria, forcing it to change its current policy. They are imposing a blockade on Syria's exports and creating chaos domestically, causing investors to smuggle their funds out of the country. The minister also said that the United States is relying on certain foreign agents and organizations within Syria to carry out this conspiracy.

The minister pointed out that some Syrian politicians and military personnel who have fled abroad and been sentenced to death and imprisonment are conspiring against Syria together with imperialism.

Meanwhile, according to the Middle East News Agency, the Syrian newspaper "Al-Ra'i al-Amm" reported on June 3rd on the ambiguous activities of the American and Turkish military attachés in Damascus. The newspaper said that the American Air Force attaché flies his private plane to an unknown location three or four times a week. Turkish military attaché, Colonel Najati Okan, goes to Beirut every day.

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Damascus News: The leader of the Syrian opposition People's Party, al-Kikhiya, submitted his resignation to parliament on the evening of June 3rd. The party's General Secretary, al-Dawalibi, announced on the same day that the thirty deputies of the People's Party had decided to resign collectively.

Al-Dawalibi said that the resignation was in protest against a debate in parliament on the evening of June 1st. During this debate, Syrian Communist Party deputy, Khalid Bakdash, accused People's Party deputies of attempting to delay the approval of the 1957 budget for foreign and imperialist reasons.

It is reported that if the People's Party deputies insist on resigning, the other fifteen deputies allied with the People's Party may also resign.

The collective resignation of the People's Party deputies is seen as an attempt to cause a political crisis in Syria. Since the Jordan incident, American and British imperialism have been hoping to stir up unrest in Syria in order to further destroy nationalist forces in the Middle East.

The People's Party is the largest opposition party in Syria. In the recent trial of the conspiracy to subvert the current government in Syria, many leaders and deputies of this party were involved and sentenced.

The collective resignation of the People's Party deputies confronts the Syrian authorities with two choices: dissolving parliament and holding by-elections. Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali stated on the 3rd that the current cabinet will continue to govern as long as the ruling party's majority in parliament is not affected.

    叙利亚经济部长否认有内阁危机
    指责帝国主义分子在叙进行颠覆活动
    人民党议员决定集体辞职搞乱政局
    新华社开罗4日电　最近一期的埃及“鲁兹·优素福”周刊报道，目前在开罗访问的叙利亚经济部长卡拉斯说，关于叙利亚发生内阁危机的传闻是不真实的。
    卡拉斯在同这家周刊记者的谈话中说，叙利亚目前仍在奉行解放和阿拉伯团结的政策。现内阁将继续执政到议会期满为止。
    他说，各种帝国主义分子正在对叙利亚施加压力，迫使它改变它目前的政策。他们对叙利亚的输出实行封锁，并且在国内制造混乱，使投资者把他们的资金偷运出国。这位部长还说，美国是依靠在叙利亚国内的某些外国代理人和组织来执行这种阴谋的。
    这位部长指出，一些逃往国外的被判决死刑和徒刑的叙利亚政客和军人，正在同帝国主义一起对叙利亚进行阴谋。
    同时，据中东通讯社报道，叙利亚的“舆论报”3日报道了美国和土耳其驻大马士革武官的暧昧活动。这家报纸说，美国空军武官每星期乘他的私人飞机到某一个不详的地方去三、四次。土耳其武官纳加提·奥甘上校每天都要到贝鲁特去。
    新华社4日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚反对党人民党领袖基希雅6月3日晚向议会提出了辞呈。这个党的总书记达瓦利比在同一天宣布，人民党的三十个议员已经决定要集体辞职。
    达瓦利比说，这次辞职是对6月1日晚议会中的一次辩论表示抗议。在这次辩论中，叙利亚共产党议员巴格达什指责人民党议员为了外国和帝国主义的原因而企图拖延1957年度预算的批准。
    据报道，如果人民党议员坚持辞职的话，同人民党联盟的另外十五名议员也可能要辞职。
    人民党议员的集体辞职被认为是要在叙利亚引起政局危机的一个尝试。自从约旦事件以来，美英帝国主义一直期望在叙利亚挑起骚乱，以便进一步摧毁中东的民族主义力量。
    人民党是叙利亚最大的反对党，在不久前叙利亚的阴谋颠覆现政府案的审讯中，有不少这个党的领袖和议员牵涉在内并且被判刑。
    人民党议员的集体辞职使叙利亚当局面临着解散议会和举行补缺选举这两种选择。叙利亚总理阿萨利已经在3日表明，只要执政党在议会的多数不受到影响，现内阁就要继续当政。
