Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The 52nd plenary session of the State Council on June 14th discussed the inspection report by Qian Ying, Minister of Supervision, on the incident of people starving to death in Guangxi Province in 1956 due to famine, and approved the decision to punish the relevant derelict personnel. On the 15th, the 73rd meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress discussed Premier Zhou Enlai's report on this incident.

In 1956, Guangxi Province suffered a severe famine, with approximately 14,700 farmers fleeing the area; approximately 550 people across the province can be confirmed to have starved to death due to lack of food. The most severe areas were in Pingle and Lipu counties in the Pingle Special Zone, and Heng County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, where it was clearly verified that over 300 people starved to death.

The objective reasons for this serious incident were that Guangxi Province suffered severe floods and droughts in 1955, with 12.56 million mu of cultivated land affected, and 6.28 million mu severely affected, resulting in a reduction of 1 billion jin of grain, leading to a severe spring famine in 1956; coupled with continuous spring rains, early-maturing crops were reduced by about 50%. However, by relying on the superiority of the people's democratic system and agricultural cooperation, conscientiously grasping disaster relief work, and promptly distributing the large amount of grain and funds supported by the state to the disaster-stricken people, such a serious incident of starvation deaths could have been completely avoided. From July 1956 to January 1957, Guangxi Province experienced seven months of drought without rain. Therefore, the spring famine in 1957 was even more severe than in 1956, but thanks to the effective measures taken by the provincial leading organs, the spring famine has now been basically overcome safely. This shows that the serious incident of starvation deaths in 1956 was mainly due to the serious bureaucratism of the main leaders of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee who were indifferent to the suffering of the people.

In January and February of 1956, Guangxi Province already experienced famine fleeing and abnormal deaths. The Guangxi leadership did not treat this phenomenon as a serious warning sign to call on the broad masses of cadres across the province to pay close attention. In March, as the disaster continued to develop, Hunan Province telegraphed Guangxi twice, reporting that batches of disaster-stricken people were flowing into Hunan. At this time, the provincial party and government leading organs issued disaster relief instructions and designated 22 heavily affected counties to establish production and disaster relief committees to fully engage in disaster relief. The persons in charge of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee divided their responsibilities and went to the countryside to personally lead production and disaster relief work, and successively organized 1,419 staff members to investigate and provide disaster relief.

In the disaster relief work in 1956, the Guangxi provincial leading organs allocated a total of 10,040,500 yuan in disaster relief funds, grain relief funds, and credit cooperative loans, increased the unified purchase and sale of grain by 100 million jin, and dispatched special personnel to investigate and provide disaster relief. These measures played a role in preventing further expansion of the disaster. However, due to a lack of in-depth understanding of the situation at the grassroots level, it was assumed that Pingle, Lipu, Heng and other counties had always had high grain yields, and that the disaster only occurred sporadically (i.e., bumper harvest areas and disaster areas were interspersed), thus neglecting the disaster relief work in these counties. Consequently, these disaster-stricken counties were omitted from the 22 designated counties. Guangxi Province made achievements in disaster relief work in other disaster areas, but the disaster situation in these counties became more serious in April, and the phenomenon of abnormal deaths increased significantly. It was not until this time that the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China paid attention to the disaster situation in these counties, sent people to Pingle, Lipu and Heng counties to inspect the disaster situation, and vigorously assisted in disaster relief. However, these steps were too late for the serious disaster situation at the time. Irreparable losses had already been caused in these areas.

After this incident occurred, the Guangxi provincial party and government supervisory departments had dispatched people to the disaster areas four times last year, together with relevant departments, to investigate the disaster situation and the situation of the deceased, and to study the responsibilities of the province, special zones, and counties in this incident. In December last year, the Central Supervisory Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China jointly sent personnel to conduct an inspection together with the Supervisory Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Supervisory Office of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee. In April this year, the above-mentioned units, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, organized an inspection team, and also absorbed members of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and staff members of relevant departments of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee to conduct a comprehensive inspection.

After inspection, the Central Supervisory Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Supervision believed that: In this incident, among the Guangxi provincial leading cadres, Chen Manyuan, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hao Zhongshi, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Governor of Guangxi Province, and Xiao Yizhou, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, should bear the main responsibility. Chen Manyuan was satisfied with his work achievements, developed serious complacency, lacked democratic style, neglected political and ideological leadership, was seriously divorced from the masses in his work, and failed to pay attention to serious natural disasters, failing to strengthen the leadership of disaster relief work in a timely manner. Hao Zhongshi, due to a lack of concern for the suffering of the masses, neglected the seriousness of the disaster, and failed to actively take effective measures to urge the relevant departments of the Provincial People's Committee and the special commissioner's office and county people's committees to grasp production and disaster relief work. Xiao Yizhou was responsible for leading financial, economic and grain work. Due to his lack of in-depth work, lack of understanding of the situation at the grassroots level, and failure to recognize the seriousness of the disaster, he failed to lead relevant departments to timely carry out grain supply work for disaster relief, which led to the aggravation of the disaster.

In addition, the negligence of the disaster situation, disregard for human life, and even dereliction of duty by the persons in charge of certain Guangxi provincial party committees, county party committees, and special commissioner's offices and county people's committees, and their poor work style of failing to act in accordance with the instructions of the province, were also seriously responsible for the deterioration of the disaster situation.

In order to strictly enforce party discipline and educate all party members, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has given strict punishments to Chen Manyuan, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hao Zhongshi, Secretary, Xiao Yizhou, Secretary, Yang Lin, Secretary of the Pingle Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, He Shumin, Deputy Secretary of the Pingle Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiao Zhizhou, Secretary of the Pingle County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Wenlu, Secretary of the Lipu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ai Zhiguo, Deputy Secretary, and Xue Qiushui, Secretary of the Heng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, respectively.

The plenary session of the State Council, based on the report of the Ministry of Supervision and the discussions at the meeting, has decided to give strict punishments to Hao Zhongshi, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, Xiao Yizhou, Chen Manyuan, Member of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee, Duan Shuxiang, Deputy Commissioner of the Pingle Special Commissioner's Office (Commissioner Zhu Weiping was on sick leave at the time), and Li Shanben, Deputy County Head of Lipu County (County Head Mo Zicheng was studying off-site at the time).

　　去年广西因灾饿死人事件是怎样发生和怎样处理的？
    新华社17日讯　6月14日，国务院第五十二次全体会议上，讨论了监察部钱瑛部长关于广西省1956年因灾荒饿死人事件的检查报告，并且通过了处分有关失职人员的决定。15日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第七十三次会议讨论了周恩来总理关于这个事件的报告。
    广西省在1956年因发生严重灾荒，先后共约有一万四千七百多个农民外逃；全省可以确定因缺粮饿死的约五百五十多人。其中以平乐专区平乐、荔浦两县和桂西僮族自治州的横县为最多，其中查明确系饿死的有三百多人。
    发生这一严重事件的客观原因，是广西省在1955年遭受了严重的水灾和旱灾，受灾耕地一千二百五十六万亩，成灾的六百二十八万亩，粮食减产十亿斤，致使1956年发生了严重的春荒；加以春雨连绵，早熟作物减收50％左右。但是，只要依靠人民民主制度和农业合作化的优越条件，认真抓紧救灾工作，及时地把国家所支援的大量粮款发到灾民手中，这样严重的饿死人的事件是完全可以避免的。1956年7月到1957年1月，广西省干旱无雨达七个月之久，因此1957年的春荒较1956年更为严重，但是由于省的领导机关采取了有效措施，目前春荒已经基本上安全渡过。由此可见，1956年因灾饿死人的严重事件，主要地还是因为当时中共广西省委员会和广西省人民委员会的主要负责人对人民疾苦漠不关心的严重官僚主义。
    在1956年1、2月间，广西省就发生了逃荒和非正常死亡现象。广西省的领导方面对于这种现象，并没有作为一种严重警号，号召全省广大干部严加注意。3月间，灾情继续发展，湖南省两次电告广西灾民成批地流入湖南。这时，省的党政领导机关才发出救灾指示，并且指定二十二个重灾县成立生产救灾委员会全力救灾，中共广西省委和广西省人民委员会负责人分工下乡亲自领导生产救灾工作，并且先后组织了一千四百一十九个工作人员查灾救灾。
    在1956年的救灾工作中，广西省的领导机关拨支了救灾款、口粮救济款、信用社贷款等先后达一千零四十万五千元，增加了统销粮食一亿斤，派遣了专门查灾救灾的人员，这些措施对于制止灾情的进一步扩大是起了作用的。但是，由于没有深入了解下情，以为平乐、荔浦、横县等县向来粮食产量较高，灾情只是插花发生（即丰收区和灾区交叉在一起），因而忽视了这几个县的救灾工作，以致所指定的二十二个县中，恰恰漏掉了这几个受灾县。广西省对其他灾区的救灾工作做出了成绩，但是这几个县的灾情在4月间却趋于严重，非正常死亡现象大量增加。直到这时，中共广西省委对于这几个县的灾情才加以注意，派人到平乐、荔浦和横县检查灾情，大力协助救灾。可是，这些步骤对于当时的严重灾情，已经是迟了。在这些地区已经造成了不可挽回的损失。
    此事件发生后，广西省党政监察部门曾在去年先后四次会同有关部门派人到灾区逐乡逐区调查灾情和死亡者的情况，并研究省、专区、县各有关方面对此事件应负的责任。去年12月，中共中央监察委员会、中华人民共和国监察部共同派出人员，会同中共广西省委监察委员会和广西省人民委员会监察厅进行检查。今年4月，上述各单位又会同内务部组织检查组，并且吸收中共广西省委员和广西省人民委员会有关部门工作人员参加，又进行了全面检查。
    中共中央监察委员会和监察部检查后认为：这个事件，在广西省级领导干部中，中共广西省委员会第一书记陈漫远，中共广西省委员会书记、广西省代理省长郝中士，广西省委员会书记、广西省副省长萧一舟应当负主要责任。陈漫远因为满足于工作成就，滋长了严重的骄傲自满情绪，民主作风不够，忽视政治思想领导，工作上严重地脱离群众，对于严重的自然灾害竟至不加重视，没有及时地加强救灾工作的领导。郝中士由于缺乏对群众疾苦的关心，忽视灾情的严重性，没有积极地采取有效措施，督促省人民委员会有关部门和专署、县人民委员会抓紧生产救灾工作。萧一舟负责领导财政经济和粮食工作，由于工作不深入，不了解下情，不认识灾情的严重性，因而没有领导有关部门及时作好救灾的粮食供应工作，致使灾情严重化。
    此外，广西省某些中共地委、县委和专署、县人民委员会负责人的忽视灾情，漠视民命，甚至玩忽职守，不按照省的指示办事的恶劣作风，对于灾情恶化也负有严重的责任。
    为了严肃党纪，教育全党同志，中共中央对于中共广西省委第一书记陈漫远、书记郝中士、萧一舟，中共平乐地委书记杨林，中共平乐地委副书记何庶民，中共平乐县委书记矫志周，中共荔浦县委书记王文陆、副书记艾治国，中共横县县委书记薛秋水等人员，已经分别给了严格处分。
    国务院全体会议根据监察部的报告和会议的讨论，已决定对广西省副省长郝中士、萧一舟，广西省人民委员会委员陈漫远，平乐专署副专员段书香（专员祝维平当时因病休养），荔浦县副县长李善本（县长莫子成当时离职学习）等人分别给了严格的处分。
