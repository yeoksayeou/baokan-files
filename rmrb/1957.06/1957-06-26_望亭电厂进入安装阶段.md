Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 25th: The Wangting Thermal Power Plant, the largest thermal power plant newly built in East China after liberation, is under intense construction.

Now, walking through the dense scaffolding in the factory area, one can see that the skeleton of the main plant building has been basically completed, and the civil construction work has entered the stage of bricklaying and plastering. The sound of metal hammering resounding through the fields and the sparks of electric welding indicate that it has entered a stage of intense installation. On the boiler construction site, three boilers are under construction simultaneously. The first boiler is already being walled and roofed. On the second boiler, many workers are installing various pipes.

Outside the main plant building, various auxiliary projects are also under intense construction. The civil construction work of the coal conveying and water and electricity systems is nearing completion, and the brackets of the belt conveyor and coal feeders, coal pulverizers, and coal feeders are being installed. The step-up substation has already erected the first row of power transmission towers.

By the end of this year, two boilers and a 22,000-kilowatt turbine generator in this factory will be put into production. (Attached picture)

　　望亭电厂进入安装阶段
    据新华社南京25日电  华东地区解放后新建的最大一个火力发电厂——望亭火力发电厂正在紧张施工。
    现在，穿过这个工厂厂区密密层层的脚手架，可以看出主厂房的骨架工程已经基本完成，土木建筑工程已经进入砌墙和粉刷的阶段。响震田野的金属敲打声和电焊火花四溅的情况说明这里已经进入紧张的安装阶段。锅炉工地上，有三台锅炉在交叉施工。第一台锅炉已经在砌炉墙、盖屋面。第二台锅炉上，有许多工人正在安装各种管子。
    在主厂房的外面，各附属工程也正紧张地进行施工。输煤和水、电系统的土木建筑工程即将完成，皮带输煤机的支架和燃煤机、磨煤机、给煤机都在安装。升压站已经竖好第一排输电铁塔。
    到今年年底，这个工厂将有二台锅炉和一台二万二千瓩的汽轮发电机可以投入生产。（附图片）
