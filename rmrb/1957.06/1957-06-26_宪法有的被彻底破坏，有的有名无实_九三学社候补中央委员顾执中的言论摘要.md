What People Are Saying:

　　Some articles of the Constitution have been completely destroyed, others exist in name only. Excerpts from Gu Zhizhong's speech, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society.

　　Some clauses of the Constitution exist in name only, and some have been violated without being stopped. For example, Article 85 of the Constitution stipulates that citizens are equal before the law, but in reality, many phenomena are not like this. Article 89 stipulates that the freedom of person is inviolable, and that no one may be arrested without a decision by a court or approval by a procuratorate, but the actions during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries prove that this article was completely destroyed. Article 87 stipulates freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, but in fact, these have not been guaranteed. For example, some articles criticizing the People's Daily have not been published to this day. Newspapers only publish peaceful and uneventful content, and if exposing internal contradictions of the people slightly touches on certain figures, ministers, etc., they are not published. Freedom of assembly and association is even less available, and many people's organizations are almost entirely organized by the government. Can there be new democratic parties? The Constitution does not say no, but in fact, no one dares to do it boldly. Article 94 stipulates that citizens have the right to education. However, the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education are asking everyone to forgive them, saying that because there are too few schools, and there is no birth control, there are too many people, and not everyone can attend school, thus the Constitution has also been destroyed.

　　Since the Constitution was passed in 1954, some of it has been completely destroyed, and some exists in name only. Few people implement the united front policy and democratic centralism stipulated in the Constitution. Everyone treats the Constitution as a piece of paper, and it's over after it is passed. Back then, when discussing the draft constitution, everyone was willing to fight to protect the Constitution, but now, from Chairman Liu to ordinary citizens, no one mentions protecting the Constitution. If this continues, the Constitution will be treated as toilet paper, arbitrarily arresting people, arbitrarily detaining people, opening letters, etc., can be done arbitrarily, what will happen in the future!

　　The sectarianism of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee is very strong. After liberation, old news workers rarely received care or did not receive care. Some newspapers that were allowed to continue operating after liberation, such as Wenhui and Xinmin, did not receive care from the government and were left to fend for themselves. The treatment of party newspapers and non-party newspapers, and party reporters and non-party reporters is different. Non-party reporters are treated with contempt when interviewing, and many agencies do not allow them to interview.

　　Before liberation, there were many news agencies. Now, there are two in name—China News Service and Xinhua News Agency. In reality, domestic news is only handled by Xinhua News Agency, which monopolizes the news of the whole country and is too full to eat.

　　I suggest: 1. The persons in charge of propaganda of the democratic parties should participate in the propaganda meetings of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee. If "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is not a lie, even if we do not participate in the leadership work of propaganda, we should be informed of the situation of the meeting.

　　2. Xinhua News Agency should become an international news agency like TASS and Reuters. Domestically, democratic parties, organizations, and local governments should be allowed to run news agencies.

　　Having participated in many symposiums, I feel that there are two deviations: the masses are somewhat left, and the People's Daily is somewhat right. Those who have been criticized in past movements, although they know that the great "blooming and contending" should not go beyond the track of supporting the Communist Party and building socialism, cannot control their emotions when speaking, and inevitably go beyond the track.

　　It is very difficult for members of democratic parties to speak. If they speak a little too harshly, they will be criticized in the newspapers. If they are gentle, they will be scolded. So, neither left nor right is right. It is difficult to achieve just the right balance.

　　Chu Anping's speech may have been well-intentioned, but the wording was inappropriate and provocative. It is recommended that the leaders of the Jiusan Society discuss it to avoid causing confusion.

### 宪法有的被彻底破坏，有的有名无实  九三学社候补中央委员顾执中的言论摘要

专栏：什么话

　　宪法有的被彻底破坏，有的有名无实
    九三学社候补中央委员顾执中的言论摘要
    宪法所规定的条文。有些是有名无实，有些被破坏而没有受到制止。例如宪法第八十五条规定公民在法律上一律平等，实际许多现象却不是这样。第八十九条规定人身自由不受侵犯，非经法院决定或检察院批准不受逮捕，而肃反时的行动证明这一条文全被破坏了。第八十七条规定的言论、出版、集会、结社的自由，事实都没有得到保证。例如有些批评人民日报的文章，至今仍没被登出。报社只登风平浪静的东西，揭露人民内部矛盾稍为联系到某些人物、部长等便不予发表。集会结社的自由更少，许多人民团体几乎都是官方包办。可不可以再有新的民主党派？宪法没说不行，但事实却没有人敢大胆的做。第九十四条规定公民有受教育的权利。但高教部和教育部却在叫请大家原谅，说因为学校少，生育没有节制，人太多了，不能人人入学，这样宪法也被破坏了。
    宪法自1954年通过以后，有的被彻底破坏了，有的有名无实。也很少有人执行宪法中所规定的统战政策和民主集中制。大家都把宪法当作一张纸，通过后也就算了。想当年，在讨论宪法草案的时间，大家都愿为保护宪法而斗争，现在从刘委员长到一般公民谁也不提保护宪法了。这样下去，把宪法当成了手纸，乱关人、乱捕人、拆信等等，都可以为所欲为，将来何堪设想！？
    中宣部的宗派主义情绪很浓厚，解放后对老新闻工作人员很少照顾或者没有照顾。解放后仍允许续办的一些报纸如文汇、新民等报也没有得到政府的照顾，让非党的报纸自生自灭。党报与非党报、党报记者与非党报记者的待遇都不同，非党报记者采访时受到轻视，许多的机关还不让他们去采访。
    解放前有许多通讯社，现在名义上有两家——中国新闻社和新华社，实际国内新闻只有新华社一家，包办了全国的消息，肚子吃得太饱撑不下。
    我建议：一、民主党派宣传方面的负责者应该参加中宣部的宣传会议。假如“长期共存、互相监督”不是句假话，即使不参加宣传方面的领导工作，也应该让我们知道会议情况。
    二、新华社应像塔斯社、路透社等那样，成为国际性的通讯社，国内则开放让民主党派、团体、地方办通讯社。
    参加了许多座谈会，感觉有两种偏差：群众有些左，人民日报又有些右。在过去运动中受到整的，虽然知道大“鸣”大“放”不应越出拥护共产党和建设社会主义这个轨道，但在讲话时，控制不住感情，不免有越出轨道的地方。
    民主党派成员讲话很苦，稍为讲得厉害点，报纸上便批评，和风细雨一点，又会挨骂，所以左也不是，右也不是，很难做到恰如其分。
    储安平的发言，意思可能是好的，但用词不当，有刺激性，建议九三学社领导加以讨论，以免引起混乱。
