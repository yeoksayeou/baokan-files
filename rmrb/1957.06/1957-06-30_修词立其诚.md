　　Establishing Sincerity Through Rhetoric
　　Jin Xingyao
    In recent years, there has been a phrase that has been widely recited and used, which is that we need to have a "common language." As for what standard or foundation this so-called common language is based on, I will presumptuously attempt to interpret it here, and would like to annotate it with "establishing sincerity through rhetoric" from the "Book of Changes." This saying may seem a bit mysterious or pedantic, but it is actually very plain and not outdated. Throughout history, there are many articles that people never tire of reading hundreds of times, and there is no other reason than that they establish sincerity through rhetoric. Our ancestors also put a lot of effort into the word "sincerity," and it did indeed have a function that could not be conveyed by words alone. Lu Xun is the most realistic example. Not to mention his thick twenty-volume "Complete Works of Lu Xun," even some of his letters, with just a few hundred words, always have a kind of intimacy and sincerity that permeates the paper and infects us. This is not only an artistic life, but also the common language of all conscientious Chinese people.
    There are certainly more than one reason why people often think of Lu Xun, but this is the most important and significant reason.
    Since the Party proposed the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and convened the propaganda work conference, many good articles and good opinions have indeed emerged. However, on the other hand, many opportunistic dregs have floated to the surface, and there are even things like "my poison." "Lowly words, no lofty theories," in the middle of this, let me draw a line of minimal limit, then, between sincerity and insincerity, is something that anyone with a little discernment can see at a glance. Words express the mind, and sophistry is ultimately difficult to prevail, and therefore it is impossible to obtain a common language.
    "Intellectuals are prone to impulsiveness, and when they criticize, they inevitably have biases and sharpness." But there is a prerequisite here, which is that there must be sincerity. Without sincerity, no matter how biased, how sharp, or even claiming to be hard-boned, but when you open it up and take a look, I am afraid it can only be regarded as the boxing manual of a clown.
    "Rhetoric should be sincere, so as to establish one's career." This saying is still worth carefully considering and pondering for us, but for the gentlemen who shout "kill the communists," it inevitably seems sour.
    But here, I am still willing to be frank: For resolving contradictions among the people, instead of saying these ostentatious, murderous words, it is better to say more words that, even if they are sour, can actually become a "common language."

### 修词立其诚

　　修词立其诚
　　金性尧
    近年来，有那么一句话，为大家所熟诵和使用着，就是我们需要有一种“共同的语言”。这所谓共同的语言究竟以什么为准绳，又以什么为基础，我这里姑且强作解人，想给它下个注脚，即是“易经”里的“修词立其诚”。这话看起来似乎有点玄秘或迂腐，其实倒是非常平实，而且并不过时。古往今来，有许多文章所以使人不厌百回读者，无他，修词立其诚而已。我们的先辈，也有在诚字上用过许多功夫的，同时也的确起过非笔舌所能言传的功用。鲁迅就是一个最现实的例子。且不说他的厚厚二十本的“鲁迅全集”，单以寥寥几百字的一些书简来说，也总有那么一种透过纸背的亲切和诚挚在感染着我们，这不但是一种艺术的生命，而且也是一切有良心的中国人的共同的语言。
    人们所以常常想起鲁迅的理由固然不止一端，然而这却是一个最重要最显著的理由。
    自从党提出争鸣齐放的方针，以至召开宣传工作会议以来，的确出现过许多好文章好意见，可是一面却也有许多乘机起哄的沉滓浮泛起来，甚至还有“我的毒”那样的东西。“卑之无甚高论”，这中间，且让我划一条起码限度的界线吧，那末，诚与不诚之间，是稍有眼力的人所一望而知的。言为心声，强词究竟难以夺理，因此也就无法取得共同的语言了。
    “知识分子容易冲动，既要批评，就难免有偏激和尖锐的地方”。但这里有一个前提，就是必须要有诚意，离开了诚意，无论偏激，无论尖锐，甚至自命为硬骨头，但揭开一看，恐怕也只能看作二丑的拳经而已。
    “修词欲其诚，所以居业也。”这话对于我们，还是值得细细体味和思索的，但对于大喊“杀共产党人”的先生们，却不免显得酸溜溜了。
    但我在这里，还是愿意推诚相见：对于解决人民内部矛盾，与其说这些虚张声势、杀气腾腾的话，还不如多说一些尽管是酸溜溜的、而实际却可以成为“共同的语言”的语言。
