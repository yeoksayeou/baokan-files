Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th – A dozen workers from the jointly owned public-private Nanyang Rubber Factory held a forum on the 12th to refute the erroneous statements of Rong Zizheng, Standing Committee Member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Manager of the Tianjin Rubber Company, and former Director of the Nanyang Rubber Factory, regarding "Marxism-Leninism not being applicable to China."

　　Rong Zizheng's fallacies:
　　“Marxism-Leninism doesn't align in many areas when applied to China”
　　“Chinese capitalists are not sitting idle and reaping without labor”

Rong Zizheng raised these questions on May 30th when the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited representatives from industrial and commercial circles to a symposium. He said: “The Party's treatment of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is based on Marxist-Leninist theory, but many Marxist-Leninist writings were written in an earlier period, and when these theories are applied to China, they don't align in many areas. For example, in political economics, it is said that after an independent laborer rises to become an exploiter, the original capital is quickly spent, and then they reap without labor. But this is not the case with the Chinese national bourgeoisie. We are hardworking and thrifty, earning more and spending less, and even after we rise to become exploiters, we are not sitting idle and reaping without labor, but rather working even harder. Therefore, when we study political economics, we hear it but don't believe it, we can't accept it.” Therefore, he immediately went on to say that the redemption policy was flawed: “The central government said that the redemption would be complete, not half redemption and half confiscation. But in fact, the actual price of redemption is equivalent to confiscating most of the private exploitation. Before the joint operation of enterprises, the tax bureau, in order to collect more taxes, valued everything very highly during audits and investigations. However, when industrial and commercial management departments assessed the property during the joint operation of enterprises, they undervalued everything, resulting in a reduction of private shares. These departments said that they were being realistic and fair and reasonable when carrying out the above work, and both of these tasks were carried out under the supervision of workers. However, the two 'being realistic' and the two supervisions caused the property of private enterprises across the country to change from 4.5 billion yuan to 2.2 billion yuan in share capital after the joint operation.” He also asked: In the process of utilization, restriction, and transformation of industry and commerce over the past few years... has it been too "leftist"?

After his opinions were published in the newspaper, they were first refuted by Qiao Weixiong, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Director of the Office of the Grain Industry Company, and Yang Zhenhua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, at a forum held by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China from the 4th to the 6th. On June 5th, Rong Zizheng reiterated his views at a forum held by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, again emphasizing the contributions of Chinese capitalists in "building their fortunes through diligence and thrift" and "laying the foundation for modern production." Later, people from all walks of life launched a rebuttal against his opinions.

　　“Marxism-Leninism doesn't align in China” is nonsense
　　The victory of the peaceful transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises
　　Is precisely the creative application of Marxism-Leninism in China

At the forum on the 4th, Qiao Weixiong used Chairman Mao's argument that "the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism" to illustrate the role of Marxism-Leninism in the Chinese revolution. He said: It is precisely because we have the Communist Party, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and Chairman Mao Zedong, who is good at combining Marxism-Leninism with the actual conditions in China, that we have a series of victories in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and that we can complete the New Democratic Revolution and basically achieve the victory of the Socialist Revolution, with the people of the whole country living and working in peace and contentment, and our industrialists and businessmen can build a socialist society together with the people of the whole country. These facts all show that Marxism-Leninism has been creatively applied in our country. Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth that applies to the whole world. The victory of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country is even more deeply felt by industrialists and businessmen. The application of Marxism-Leninism in China is also an important contribution of our country to the international communist movement. How can we say that the application of Marxism-Leninism in China doesn't align in many areas?

Yang Zhenhua also believes that the Party's adoption of a redemption policy towards the national bourgeoisie is a creative application of Marxism-Leninism.

At the forum on the 6th, Tang Baoxin, Deputy Director of Renli Woolen Textile Factory, pointed out: Rong Zizheng said that Marxism was formed a hundred years ago in the era of capitalist development in Europe, and is suitable for Germany and Russia, but after being moved to China, it doesn't align in many areas; in China, there are only the very poor and the slightly poor, and there is no distinction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. I disagree with his argument. In China, there are not only landlords and peasants, but also the working class and the bourgeoisie. If there were no bourgeoisie in China, then the socialist transformation of capitalism would be completely illusory, and all the work of the past eight years would have to be re-evaluated. In fact, the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party lies precisely in its creative application of Marxism-Leninism, its correct analysis of the social nature and historical characteristics of China, and its realistic distinction between the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, and treating them differently.

Che Chongyuan, Deputy Manager of the Paint and Dye Industry Company, said: Rong Zizheng said that the application of Marxism-Leninism in China doesn't align in many areas. In fact, it is an estimate of the Party's work on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and an estimate of the Party's line. I cannot agree with the estimate put forward by Rong Zizheng. I believe that the reason why peaceful transformation without bloodshed or gunfire can be realized is that the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the government have played a decisive role, and it is precisely the result of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific conditions and historical conditions, and its creative application.

Wan Guoquan, Deputy Manager of the Dye Chemical Industry Company, said: The Communist Party has shortcomings in implementing policies, but this does not mean that the application of Marxism-Leninism in China doesn't align. ... If it is said that Marxism-Leninism doesn't align in China, it means that these policies are not good, and I cannot agree with this. There are some shortcomings in the work, but the achievements are definite. ... We cannot say that the application of Marxism-Leninism in China doesn't align in many areas because there are some shortcomings.

　　Workers of Nanyang Rubber Factory expose Rong Zizheng's old secrets
　　Let's see how this capitalist "built his fortune through diligence"

Jin Baofu and Wang Fucai, workers of the Nanyang Rubber Factory formerly owned by Rong Zizheng, pointed out at the forum held on the 12th: Rong Zizheng said that the Chinese national bourgeoisie "built their fortune through diligence" and also said "hardworking and thrifty." We are all old workers of the Nanyang Rubber Factory. At that time, Rong Zizheng was "diligent." When the workers were on the day shift, he got up very early every morning and called the workers up one by one to go to work. He slept during the day, and when the workers were on the night shift, he supervised the workers' production at night. At that time, the longest working hours for workers could reach eighteen hours. In addition to this, workers had to wipe the floor and hold children for his family. Despite this, the income of workers was generally only three or four catties of cornmeal per person per day, and after deducting food expenses, the income was very small.

At the forum held by the Heping District Office of the trade union on the 11th, Liu Deqing from the Heping District Central Store of the Sugar and Pastry Company said: The statement by Rong Zizheng, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, that "the Chinese national bourgeoisie is hardworking and thrifty, earning more and spending less, and working even harder" is simply a fallacy. Take the capitalist of our Guishunzhai Pastry Shop, for example. He started by selling sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and pot-scrap soup, and later opened three pastry stores and a pastry factory. How did he get this money? Can capitalists make money? It's all exploitation of our workers. The capitalist doesn't use formal skilled workers, but only uses amateurs or old people and children, and he replaces them many times a year. Our workers call him a "human trafficker." He employs people like this, spends less money, and exploits more. The workers work eighteen or nineteen hours a day, but the capitalist spends the whole day eating, drinking, and having fun. What is the capitalist's hard work? It's just racking his brains to exploit the workers. Zheng Zuyin from Qianxiangyi Chenji Cloth Shop said: Our capitalist used to come to the counter less than once a year. He just smoked opium and played with birds at home. When he went out, there were a dozen people following him. Can we say that he started from labor and worked too hard?

People from industrial and commercial circles also believe that Rong Zizheng's statement is wrong. Qiao Weixiong pointed out: Rong Zizheng also said that the Chinese national bourgeoisie is hardworking and thrifty, earning more and spending less, and even after we rise to become exploiters, we are not sitting idle and reaping without labor, but rather working even harder. I think the meaning of these words of Rong Zizheng is that the Chinese national bourgeoisie started from labor. However, we must ask, for whom are the bourgeoisie working hard, and why do they have to work hard? We do not deny that the national bourgeoisie of our country has its own particularities, such as its anti-imperialist patriotism, but more importantly, the Chinese national bourgeoisie also has the common characteristics of the bourgeoisie. Ignoring this essential commonality is very detrimental to the ideological transformation of our industrialists and businessmen.

Yang Zhenhua believes that some people in the Chinese national bourgeoisie are indeed hardworking and thrifty, but this also comes from exploiting workers. Moreover, the hard work of the national bourgeoisie is for greater exploitation of workers. Therefore, denying the difference between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in our country is denying reality and disregarding reality. Tang Baoxin said: I believe that we are hardworking and thrifty, and we are careful in our calculations, for the purpose of pursuing profits. The more careful we are in our calculations, the greater the exploitation of the working class. He agreed with Rong Zizheng's suggestion to write a textbook on political economy suitable for Chinese people to learn based on the specific situation in China, but he pointed out: We cannot require Marxist-Leninist political economy to deny class and deny exploitation. This is a fundamental point of view and an objective existence.

Che Chongyuan pointed out: From the actual situation, the bourgeoisie exploits workers. In socialist countries, workers can get the enterprise done well without capitalists, while in capitalist countries, capitalists cannot leave workers. Exploitation is an objective fact. Hiding this point is not conducive to further ideological transformation of our industrialists and businessmen.

Ji Xiaocun, Deputy Director of Fuxing Flour Factory, said at the forum on the 6th: I ask Rong Zizheng to consider, were you thrifty and hardworking at that time for the working class? What was the hard work at that time for? I am afraid it was to satisfy your own desires, and incidentally establish an economic foundation. I think Rong Zizheng's words are in line with the old economists' view that people start from selfishness and self-interest to achieve social prosperity. Old economists believe that everyone is for themselves, and through competition, society will become prosperous. However, today there are indeed some people who are not for themselves, but for others, and this is the working class. So we must learn from them.

Wan Guoquan said: The Party's policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation, the policies of both criticism and unity, and the policies of fixed interest for seven years to gradually get rid of private ownership are all formulated based on the characteristics of the bourgeoisie, and they are all completely correct. Mentioning that there are shortcomings in taxation, assessment, and public bonds, I agree, but the achievements should be affirmed. Although there are shortcomings in taxation, it has played a role in developing production. Although there are some problems in the assessment work, the state's policies of fairness and reasonableness and full consultation are correct.

Yang Zhenhua affirmed: Although the Party has some shortcomings in the process of transforming the national bourgeoisie, this line is completely correct.

Qiao Weixiong expressed his disagreement with Rong Zizheng's statement that before the joint operation, the tax bureau valued everything very highly during audits and investigations in order to collect more taxes, while the property was undervalued during the assessment of property during the joint operation of enterprises. He said: Some cadres had some shortcomings in their work style in tax work and inventory work, but in general they were realistic and fair and reasonable. When I participated in the industrial and commercial socialist transformation team during the joint operation, I believed that the responsible comrades at all levels repeatedly explained the policies, and they must be realistic and fair and reasonable. People who participated in the work felt that the government was not afraid of overestimating at that time, but afraid of underestimating. I personally participated in the assessment work of Shoufeng Flour Factory. The public share representatives and we repeatedly consulted together and achieved realism and fairness and reasonableness.

Che Chongyuan said: Some people have suggested that the side effects of the "Five-Anti" Movement are too great. I disagree. The operating style and life of our industrialists and businessmen before the "Five-Anti" Movement were completely different from today. These changes are unimaginable without the education of the "Five-Anti" Movement. The "Five-Anti" Movement made our industrialists and businessmen realize the shortcomings and errors of the past. Although some of the methods in the movement had some deviations, we should comprehensively and realistically estimate this movement. He also said: Taxation has played a role in restoring the national economy and ensuring national construction. The shortcomings are that there are some phenomena of excessively high, excessively low, and uneven burdens in some places, and there are also phenomena of excessively rich households in the evaluation of households. This issue can be checked again. The government has always attached great importance to the work of clearing assets and valuations. In the first stage of the joint operation of individual enterprises, the government repeatedly studied and reviewed the valuation of enterprises, which embodied the spirit of realism and fairness and reasonableness. In the second stage of the joint operation of the entire industry, the clearing of assets and valuations was all done by industrialists and businessmen themselves. Of course, we cannot say that there are no shortcomings. However, it is not good to regard some deviations and shortcomings as general. The deviation shortcomings and policy guidelines should be distinguished and analyzed realistically. At the time of the joint operation of the entire industry, the government still achieved "leniency" and "completeness" in the clearing of assets and valuations of private enterprises.

### 天津工人和工商业者展开反击  在活的事实面前荣子正的谬论破产

　　天津工人和工商业者展开反击
　　在活的事实面前荣子正的谬论破产
    新华社天津16日电　公私合营南洋橡胶厂的十几位工人在12日举行座谈会，批驳天津市工商联常委、市橡胶公司副经理、前南洋橡胶厂厂长荣子正关于“马列主义不适用于中国”的错误言论。
　　荣子正的谬论：
    “马列主义搬到中国很多地方对不上号”
    “中国资本家不是坐享其成不劳而获”
    荣子正是在5月30日中共天津市委统战部邀请工商界座谈时提出这问题的。他说：“党对待中国民族资产阶级问题，都是根据马列主义理论办事，可是许多马列主义的理论著作，都是很早的时期写成的，把这些理论搬到中国来运用，很多地方对不上号。譬如，政治经济学里也说，独立劳动者上升为剥削者之后，原来的资金，很快就花光，然后则不劳而获。中国民族资产阶级则不然，我们是勤劳肯干，赚得多，花的少，而且在我们上升为剥削者之后，也不是坐享其成，不劳而获，而是操劳更重。因此，我们学政治经济学，很多地方是听而不信，不能接受。”从而，他紧接着说到赎买政策有错误：“中央说赎买到底，不会是半赎买半没收。但事实上，赎买代价的实际等于没收私方剥削的大半。在企业合营以前，税务局为了多收税，查账稽征时，把每件东西都估得很值钱；而工业、商业管理部门在企业合营时清估财产，又样样估得不值钱，结果减少了私方的股金。这些部门进行上述工作时，都说要实事求是，公平合理，这两种工作也都是在工人监督下进行的。可是两个‘实事求是’，两次监督，却使全国私营企业财产由四十五亿变成为合营后的股金二十二亿元。”他还提出：几年来，在对工商业利用、限制、改造过程中，……是否太“左”？
    他的意见在报纸上发表后，在4日到6日中共天津市委召开的座谈会上首先遭到了市工商联执委、粮谷工业公司办公室副主任乔维熊和工商联副秘书长杨振华等的反驳。到6月5日，荣子正又在中共天津市委召开的座谈会上重申了他的观点，再次强调中国资本家“勤俭起家”、“给现代化生产奠定了基石”的贡献。以后，各界人士都对他的意见展开了反驳。
　　“马列主义在中国对不上号”是胡说
　　对私营工商业和平改造的胜利
    正是马列主义在中国的创造性运用
    乔维熊在4日的座谈会上以毛主席“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”的论据，说明马列主义对中国革命的作用。他说：正因为我们有了共产党，有了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，有了毛泽东主席善于把马克思列宁主义与中国实际情况相结合，所以才有抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝斗争的一系列胜利，才能完成新民主主义革命和基本上取得社会主义革命的胜利，全国人民安居乐业，我们工商业者才能与全国人民一道建设社会主义社会。这些事实，都说明了马克思列宁主义在我国得到了创造性的运用。马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，我国对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的胜利，更是工商业者身感体受的，马克思列宁主义在中国的运用，也是我国对国际共产主义运动的重要贡献，怎么能说马克思列宁主义在中国的运用很多地方对不上号呢？
    杨振华也认为：党对民族资产阶级采取赎买政策，是创造性地运用了马列主义。
    仁立毛呢纺织厂副厂长唐宝心在6日的座谈会上指出：荣子正说，马克思主义形成于一百年前欧洲资本主义发展的时代，适宜于德国、俄国，但是搬到中国来以后，很多地方对不上号；在中国只有大贫和小贫，并没有资产阶级和无产阶级的区别。我不同意他的论点。在中国不但有地主阶级和农民阶级，而且有工人阶级和资产阶级，如果中国没有资产阶级，那末，对资本主义的社会主义改造完全是捕风捉影了，八年来的一切工作都要重新估价了。实际上，中国共产党的伟大，恰恰在于创造性地运用了马列主义，正确地分析中国的社会性质和历史特点，实事求是地把中国资产阶级区分为官僚资产阶级和民族资产阶级，而且加以区别对待。
    油漆染料工业公司副经理车重远说：荣子正说马列主义在中国运用很多地方对不上号，实际上是一个对党的对资本主义工商业改造工作的估计，对党的路线问题的估计，我不能同意荣子正提出的估计。我认为：没有流血、没有枪声的和平改造之所以能实现，是中国共产党和政府的政策起了决定性的作用，也正是马列主义的普遍真理和中国具体情况，历史条件相结合，创造性运用的结果。
    染料化学工业公司副经理万国权说：共产党在执行政策中有缺点，但这并不能说马列主义在中国运用对不上号。……如果说马列主义在中国对不上号，就是说这些政策不好，我是不能同意的。工作里有些缺点，但成绩是肯定的。……不能因为有一些缺点，就说马列主义在中国运用很多地方对不上号。
　　南洋橡胶厂工人揭荣子正的老底
    看看他这个资本家如何“勤劳起家”
    荣子正原属工厂南洋橡胶厂工人靳宝富、王辅才在12日召开的座谈会上指出：荣子正说中国的民族资产阶级是“勤劳起家”的，还说“勤劳肯干”。我们都是南洋橡胶厂的老工人，在那个时候，荣子正是“勤劳”的，当工人上白班的时候，他每天早晨起得很早，把工人挨个叫起来上班工作。他白天睡觉，当工人上夜班的时候，他在夜里监督工人生产。在那时候，工人最长的工作时间要达到十八个小时。除去这以外，工人还要给他家去擦地板、抱孩子。尽管这样，可是工人的收入一般每天每人只能赚三、四斤棒子面，去了伙食，收入就很少了。
    在工会和平区办事处11日举行的座谈会上，糖业糕点公司和平区中心店刘德清说：市工商联常委荣子正的“中国民族资产阶级是勤劳肯干，赚的多，花的少，操劳更重”的说法，简直是一种谬论。就拿我们店桂顺斋糕点店资本家来说，他开始是卖烧饼、果子、锅巴菜的，后来开了三个糕点门市部和一个糕点生产厂。他这钱是怎么来的呢？资本家能下钱吗？这都是剥削我们工人的。资本家不用正式技术工人，专用外行或是老头和小孩，一年还不定换多少。我们工人都管他叫“人贩子”。他这样用人，花钱少，剥削的多。工人们一天工作十八九个小时，可是资本家一天吃喝玩乐。资本家的操劳是什么呢？只不过是为剥削工人而挖空心思罢了。谦祥益辰记布店郑祖荫说：我们店资本家过去一年也不到柜上来一次，只是在家里抽大烟，玩鸟，一走动，有十几个人跟着，这能说他是劳动起家，操劳过重吗？
    工商界人士也认为荣子正的说法是错误的。乔维熊指出：荣子正还说，中国民族资产阶级是勤劳肯干，赚钱多，花的少，而且在我们上升为剥削者之后，也不是坐享其成，不劳而获，而是操劳更重。我认为荣子正这些话的意思，就是说：中国民族资产阶级是劳动起家的。可是，我们要问，资产阶级是为谁操劳，为什么要操劳？我们不否认我国的民族资产阶级是有它的特殊性，比如表现在反帝爱国上面，但更重要的是中国民族资产阶级还有资产阶级的共同性，忽视了这一本质的共同性，对于我们工商业者改造思想是很不利的。
    杨振华认为：在中国民族资产阶级中，确实有部分人是勤劳起家，但是这也是剥削工人来的，而且，民族资产阶级的勤劳是为了对工人进行更大的剥削。因此，否定了我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的区别，是否定了现实，不顾现实的说法。唐宝心说：我认为我们勤劳肯干，精打细算，为的是追求利润，越精打细算，对工人阶级的剥削越重。他同意荣子正提出的根据中国的具体情况，写一个适合于中国人学习的政治经济学教科书的意见，但他指出：我们不能要求马列主义的政治经济学否认阶级和否认剥削，这是个根本观点，也是客观存在。
    车重远指出：从实际情况来看，资产阶级是剥削工人的，在社会主义国家里，工人可以脱离开资本家搞好企业，而在资本主义国家里，资本家不能离开工人，剥削是客观存在的事实，掩盖这点，对我们工商业者进一步改造思想是不利的。
    福星面粉厂副厂长籍孝存在6日的座谈会上说：我请荣子正考虑一下，你那时勤俭起家，是不是为工人阶级呢，那时的辛苦工作是为了什么呢？恐怕是为了满足自己的欲望，附带着建立了经济基础吧。我认为荣子正的话是同旧经济学者认为人是由自私自利出发达到社会繁荣的说法相符合的。旧经济学者认为人人为了自己，通过竞争，然后社会富强。但是，今天确实有些人不是为了自己，而是为了别人，这就是工人阶级。所以我们要向他们学习。
    万国权说：党的利用、限制、改造的政策，又批评又团结的政策，定息七年逐步摆脱私有制的政策都是根据资产阶级的特点制订的，也都是完全正确的。提到收税、清估、公债等方面有缺点，我同意，但成绩是应该肯定的。税收虽有缺点，但对发展生产起到了作用。清估工作虽然有些问题，但国家的公平合理，充分协商的政策是正确的。
    杨振华肯定说：尽管党对民族资产阶级改造的过程中有些缺点，但是，这个路线是完全正确的。
    乔维熊对荣子正谈到的合营前，税务局为了多收税，查帐稽征时，把每件东西都估得很值钱，而在企业合营时清估财产，又样样估得不值钱表示不同意。他说：在税务工作和清点工作中，有些干部的作风是有些缺点的，但一般都做到了实事求是和公平合理。在合营时，我参加了工商业社会主义改造大队，我认为在清点工作中，各级负责同志一直是反复地交待政策，一定要实事求是，公平合理，我们参加工作的人都感觉到，政府当时不是怕估得高，而是怕估得低。我自己参加了寿丰面粉厂的清估工作，公股代表和我们一起反复协商，也做到了实事求是和公平合理。
    车重远说：有些人提出“五反”运动副作用太大，我不同意。“五反”前我们工商业者无论在经营作风、生活上和今天都是截然不同的，这些变化如果不经过“五反”运动的教育是不可想像的。“五反”运动使我们工商业者认识到过去的缺点和错误，运动当中虽然有的在作法上有的地方有偏差，但我们应该全面地、实事求是地来估计这个运动。他还说：税收在恢复国民经济、保证国家建设中都起了作用，缺点是有些地方偏高、偏低和负担不均衡的现象，评议户中偏肥现象也是有的。这个问题可以再检查一下。对清产估值工作政府一直是很重视的。在第一阶段个别企业合营时，政府对企业的估值都经过反复研究、审查，体现了实事求是、公平合理的精神，在第二阶段全行业合营时，清产估值都是由工商业者自点自估，当然，缺点不能说没有，但是，拿一些偏差和缺点当作一般来看，这是不好的，缺点偏差和政策方针应区别来看，应该实事求是的分析。全行业合营时，对私营企业的清产估值，政府还是做到了“宽”和“了”。
