Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 23rd. A report recently written by the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Statistics, based on survey data and statistical materials, shows that the income and living standards of Hunan farmers have significantly improved compared to pre-war levels.

The report states: According to an analysis of regular registration data on income and expenditure of 510 farm households established in 34 counties in Hunan Province since last year, and based on statistical materials, in 1936, the year with the highest income and living standards for farmers in Hunan before the war, the average net income per family member of farmers (referring to total income deducting expenses such as means of production and taxes, calculated at constant prices) was 69.71 yuan. In 1956, although Hunan suffered severe natural disasters, the net income per farm household still reached 83.2 yuan, an increase of over 19%. Looking at the consumption of major consumer goods, in 1956, the average consumption of grain per family member of farmers was 556 jin, an increase of 80 jin compared to 1936; consumption of edible oil was 4.5 jin, an increase of 1.5 jin; consumption of meat was 9.6 jin, an increase of 0.11 jin; consumption of salt was 13.3 jin, an increase of 4.11 jin; and the use of cotton cloth was 16.6 chi, an increase of 7.3 cun.

The improvement in farmers' living standards is the result of the development of agricultural and sideline production. The total output value of agricultural and sideline production in the province, calculated at constant prices, was only 2.512 billion yuan in 1936, but increased to 2.815 billion yuan in 1956. For example, the total grain output in 1936 was only 19.585 billion jin, but in 1956, despite suffering a severe drought rarely seen in a century, it still produced over 20.6 billion jin of grain.

With the development of production, farmers' purchasing power has greatly increased. By 1956, the purchasing power of each farm household member had reached 32.8 yuan, an increase of 106% compared to 1950.

The report finally mentioned the changes in the economic situation of various strata in rural areas, saying: The income of farmers of all strata has changed significantly since the land reform. The income of poor and middle peasants, who account for the vast majority of the rural population, has greatly increased. 87% of the original poor and landless peasants at the time of the land reform have seen their economic status rise to the level of upper-middle or lower-middle peasants. Currently, farm households living a wealthy or relatively wealthy life account for about 24.8% of rural households. Their average annual consumption per person is: 573 jin of grain, 4.8 jin of edible oil (including lard, etc.), 13 jin of meat, and 17.8 chi of cotton cloth. Middle-income farm households, who lead an average life, account for about 62% of rural households. Their average annual consumption per person is: 550 jin of grain, 3.5 jin of edible oil, 9.4 jin of meat, and 16.4 chi of cotton cloth. Households with relatively difficult lives account for about 13.2% of rural households. Their average annual consumption per person is: 468 jin of grain, 2.15 jin of edible oil, 5.15 jin of meat, and 14.6 chi of cotton cloth. This shows that their lives are not extremely difficult.

　　谁说农民生活没提高
    湖南87％的贫雇农生活上升到中农水平
    据新华社长沙23日电  湖南省统计局最近根据调查资料和统计材料写出一份报告，说明湖南农民的收入和生活水平比战前有了显著提高。
    报告说：根据湖南省从去年起在三十四个县建立的五百一十户农家的收支调查经常登记资料和掌握的统计材料分析，湖南农村在战前收入和生活水平最高的1936年，农民每一家庭成员平均纯收入（指全部收入扣除生产资料、税款等支出，按不变价格计算）是六十九点七一元，而1956年湖南虽然遭受严重的自然灾害，但每户农家纯收入仍达八十三点二元，增长了19％强。从主要消费品的消费情况看，1956年农民每一家庭成员平均消费粮食五百五十六斤，比1936年增加八十斤；消费食油四斤五两，增加一斤五两；消费肉类九斤六两，增加十一两；消费食盐十三斤三两，增加四斤十一两；穿用棉布十六点六尺，增加七尺三寸。
    农民生活水平的提高，是由于农副业生产发展的结果。全省农副业总产值按不变价格计算，在1936年只有二十五点一二亿元，到1956年则增长为二十八点一五亿元。例如1936年粮食总产量只有一百九十五点八五亿斤，1956年虽然受了百年来少有的大旱灾，仍产粮食二百零六亿余斤。
    随着生产的发展，农民购买力大大提高了。到1956年，每个农户家庭成员的购买力已达到三十二点八元，比1950年提高了106％。
    报告最后提到农村各阶层的经济状况的变化时说：土地改革以后各阶层农户的收入有显著变化。占农村人口绝大部分的贫农和中农收入都大大增加，原来土改时的贫雇农，有87％的户的经济地位已上升到上中农或下中农水平。现在农村中过着富裕或比较富裕生活的农户，约占农村户数的24.8％，他们每一个人一年内平均消费量为：粮食五百七十三斤，食油四斤八两（包括猪油等在内），肉类十三斤，棉布十七点八尺；生活一般的中等农户约占农村户数的62％，他们每一个人一年内的平均消费量为：粮食五百五十斤，食油三斤五两，肉类九斤四两，棉布十六点四尺；生活还比较困难的户约占农村户数的13.2％，他们每一个人一年内的平均消费量为：粮食四百六十八斤，食油二斤十五两，肉类五斤十五两，棉布十四点六尺。这说明，他们的生活也并不是顶困难的。
