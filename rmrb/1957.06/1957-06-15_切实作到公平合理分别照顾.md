　　Regulate Internal Contradictions within Cooperatives to Promote Production Development
　　The CCP Central Committee and the State Council Issue Instructions on Summer Harvest Distribution
　　Earnestly Achieve Fairness and Reasonableness, Taking Care of Different Situations
　　Balance the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members; appropriately take care of members whose income may decrease; rationally distribute grain; fully promote democracy and resolve various potential contradictions.
　　This newspaper reports: The instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on doing a good job in summer harvest distribution are as follows:

　　Experience has proven that in agricultural production cooperatives, doing a good job in distribution after the harvest is an important link in regulating internal contradictions within the cooperative, promoting production development, and consolidating the cooperative. Only when agricultural cooperatives develop production, implement the policy of overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and planning to households in the planning of labor division, ensuring that all members give full play to their strengths and receive what they deserve, and achieve fairness and reasonableness in distribution, taking care of different situations, can the income of the majority of members increase year by year. To this end, it is hoped that all localities will pay attention to the following items in the current summer harvest distribution:

　　I. The interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members must be balanced. It is wrong to overemphasize collective interests and long-term interests, retaining too much in the income distribution of agricultural cooperatives and distributing too little to members. Conversely, it is also wrong to overemphasize distributing more to members, failing to retain the necessary funds, and failing to repay loans that can be repaid. Both of these tendencies should be avoided. Generally speaking, the total income of the cooperative should be distributed according to the following principles:

　　1. Except in the case of particularly serious disasters, the production costs consumed in the current year (seeds, feed, expenditures for purchasing fertilizer, etc.) must be deducted in full in order to carry out reproduction in the next year and the next season, and to repay outstanding external loans and member investments for production turnover. Failure to deduct necessary production costs will hinder normal reproduction, which is detrimental to the state, the cooperative, and the members.

　　2. Taxes must be paid in accordance with regulations, and disaster areas will be reduced or exempted by the government in accordance with regulations.

　　3. The majority of the cooperative's total income should be distributed to members as labor remuneration, and the specific ratio may vary from time to time and from place to place. With the growth of production, labor remuneration should be appropriately increased. In some places, the summer harvest products are not for farmers' self-sufficiency but are commercial products, and it is customary to sell the summer harvest products to be used as production investment before the autumn harvest; in this case, of course, one cannot mechanically implement the principle of deducting less and distributing more, which would affect production investment before the autumn harvest.

　　Sufficient public welfare funds must be retained in accordance with regulations, which are also distributed for members' consumption, so that members lacking labor (including the "Five Guarantees" households) can receive the necessary care. When necessary, in addition to the public welfare fund, a portion can also be drawn as land remuneration for individual members.

　　4. The cooperative's public accumulation fund should generally be retained in an appropriate amount. If the income does not increase much, the public accumulation fund should not be retained too much, and it can be retained less or not at all in the event of disaster. Due debts used for capital construction (including bank, credit cooperative loans and member investments) and the price of means of production that should be repaid upon joining the cooperative should be repaid from the public accumulation fund, and should not be arbitrarily delayed, losing credit. If it is truly difficult to repay in full, full consultation should also be held with the relevant parties to agree on a solution.

　　In addition, summer harvest distribution is not a year-end settlement but only a preliminary distribution. Moreover, in some places and some cooperatives, there are several harvests a year. For the sake of simplicity, some places have adopted the form of advance payment, allocating part or most of the income to members, and determining how much each person advances according to the number of workdays each member has earned during the period between the two advance payments. This method can be used as a reference for various localities.

　　II. For those members whose income may be less than before joining the cooperative, care must be given in terms of appropriate labor arrangements, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and the implementation of mutually beneficial policies, so that they can give full play to their strengths and receive what they deserve, and strive to not reduce income, or even increase income.

　　1. Some members reduce their income due to lack of labor. Some of these families still have people who can participate in auxiliary labor. They should be absorbed as much as possible to participate in auxiliary labor within the cooperative. They can also contract certain plots of odd jobs to do. With the consent of the members, they can also be allowed to keep more private plots to give full play to the role of these auxiliary labor forces. Those who have the conditions to engage in household side businesses such as pig raising should be helped to solve the difficulties in developing side businesses. Some, due to illness or other reasons, are difficult to completely solve their difficulties simply from the aspect of labor arrangement, but do not meet the conditions of the "Five Guarantees" households, should be given appropriate care from the public welfare fund. Those whose labor force is outside, whose families have financial difficulties, and who have always relied on land income as part of their livelihood can be given appropriate land remuneration in accordance with the cooperative's regulations.

　　2. Some members have relatively high production technology, and their income is reduced due to improper division of labor or unreasonable work point recording in the cooperative. These shortcomings should be improved, their expertise should be brought into play, and the work points for technical labor should be appropriately increased so that they can obtain reasonable income.

　　3. Some members used to maintain their lives by engaging in production other than agriculture (such as carting, carpentry, stonemasonry, peddling, temporary work, fishing, etc.). When these productions are uniformly operated by the agricultural cooperative, the income distribution method is not entirely reasonable, thus reducing the income of these members. They can be allowed to continue to operate the past production, and the income belongs to the individual. The cooperative draws a part of the public accumulation fund; under the condition that the cooperative supplies raw materials or production tools have been converted into shares at a discounted price, the cooperative and the individual can also share dividends in proportion. How much to draw for the public accumulation fund and how much to share the dividends are determined by both parties through consultation.

　　4. Some members belong to relatively wealthy villages. When these wealthy villages and other villages jointly form an agricultural cooperative, unified distribution is implemented in wealthy villages and poor villages, thus reducing the income of members in wealthy villages. For this type of village, appropriate care can be given in terms of contracted production with rewards, or a method of allowing them to independently operate part or most of the production business and be responsible for their own profits and losses can be adopted to resolve the contradiction. As for whether this type of joint village cooperative needs to be further split up to establish separate cooperatives, it should be decided by the masses according to their own wishes under the principle of being conducive to production and being conducive to unity.

　　5. Some well-to-do middle peasants used to occupy more and better fruit trees, fish ponds, mulberry gardens, reed fields, bamboo forests and other means of production, and their income was relatively high. After joining the cooperative, their income was reduced. For this type of member, with the consent of the members, part or most of their original means of production can be contracted to them, and appropriate care can be given in terms of contracted production, or a certain proportion can be stipulated, and the cooperative and the contractor can share the profits in proportion.

　　Repaying the price and investment of the means of production that joined the cooperative on time, and paying them the interest they deserve, is also a way to regulate the income of well-to-do middle peasants. If the price of the means of production is indeed too low at the then market price, it should also be appropriately adjusted to make it reasonable.

　　Implementing the above measures is reasonable. The distribution principle of agricultural cooperatives is basically remuneration according to labor. However, necessary care should be given to some members with special circumstances to enable them to receive what they deserve; this care will gradually lose its necessity with the development of agricultural cooperative production and the increase in income. In the first few years of the agricultural cooperative's establishment, doing so can better gain the support and support of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and can also better unite a part of wealthy peasants, so as to further unite all members, effectively develop production, and make the cooperative increasingly consolidated.

　　III. Rationally distributing grain is a very important issue. The principle of grain distribution in agricultural cooperatives should be: first, retain the necessary seeds and feed, and ensure the completion of the state's requisition tasks, and then retain the rations needed by all members' families according to the "Three Fixes" standard. If there is still surplus grain, it should be distributed to members who have worked more. Overproduction rewards should also be allocated part or most of the grain, so that the overproducing production teams can receive appropriate care to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production.

　　The autumn harvest situation is not yet settled, and agricultural cooperatives should take into account the needs of the whole year when distributing summer grain and make appropriate arrangements. The consumption time of summer grain should generally be limited to the connection with the autumn harvest. In places where the proportion of summer grain in the total grain output is large, especially in places where autumn crops are prone to disasters, the calculation of the retention time of summer grain can be appropriately extended.

　　In some places and some cooperatives, under the condition that the total amount of rations in the entire cooperative does not exceed the state's regulations, different ration standards are stipulated for distribution according to the age, size, and strength of the members. The ration standard for children is slightly lower, the standard for adult men and women is higher, and the standard for full labor force is even higher. This method also has reference value. More fine grains and less coarse grains can be distributed to the elderly, women in labor, lactating women, and infants to show care.

　　For those members who do not work many workdays and cannot be distributed enough rations according to the standard, the cooperative should, on the one hand, retain their rations and give necessary care to some of them with public welfare funds; on the other hand, before they have cash to buy these rations, do not lend them casually, so as to avoid creating many "overspending households" and "empty distribution households" and increasing the difficulties of the cooperative. If the cooperative's funds cannot be turned around, these grains can be sold to the state as revolving grain. Revolving grain certificates can be issued to grain-deficient members so that they can buy back grain at the unified sales price with the certificates.

　　IV. Income distribution is an issue that involves the vital interests of every member. Therefore, it is necessary to fully promote democracy and resolve various potential contradictions through mass consultation and discussion. Several plans may be proposed during distribution for the masses to compare and choose. All difficulties should be presented to the masses for everyone to consider and study and discuss solutions. Some issues that only involve the special interests of a certain part of the members should also be sought the consent of this part of the members as much as possible before making a decision.

　　In the summer harvest distribution, the accounts of the cooperative must be carefully checked. Any problems such as corruption, embezzlement, waste, and chaotic systems should be promptly dealt with appropriately through the masses to benefit the unity of the entire cooperative. Do not let the problems pile up and wait until the democratic rectification of the cooperative to make a total solution.

　　调节社内矛盾促进生产发展
　　中共中央和国务院发布夏收分配指示
　　切实作到公平合理分别照顾
　　统筹兼顾国家、合作社、社员的利益；适当照顾收入可能减少的社员；合理分配粮食；充分发扬民主，解决可能发生的各种矛盾。
    本报讯　中共中央和国务院关于做好夏收分配工作的指示，全文如下：
    经验证明，在农业生产合作社中，在收获之后，做好分配工作，是调节合作社内部矛盾、促进生产发展、巩固合作社的一个重要环节。农业合作社只有发展了生产，在劳动分工的规划上，又贯彻执行了统筹兼顾、全面安排、规划到户的方针，做到全体社员各尽所长，各得其所，在分配中又做到了公平合理、分别照顾，这才能使大多数社员的收入逐年有所增加。为此，望各地在当前的夏收分配中注意下列各项：
    一、对国家的利益、合作社的利益和社员的利益必须统筹兼顾。过分地强调集体利益和长远利益，在农业合作社的收益分配中扣留过多，分给社员的过少，是不对的。反之，过分强调多分给社员，该留的资金不留，能还的贷款不还，也是不对的。这两种偏向，都应该注意避免。就一般情况来说，合作社的全部收入应该按照以下的原则来分配：
    1、除了遇到特殊严重的灾荒以外，当年消耗的生产费用（种籽、饲料、购买肥料的开支等），必须如数扣除，以便进行下年度和下一季的再生产，并且归还到期的生产周转方面的社外贷款和社员投资。不扣除必要的生产费用，将妨碍正常的再生产，这对国家、合作社和社员都是不利的。
    2、必须照章纳税，灾荒地区由政府照章减免。
    3、社的全部收入的大部分应该作为劳动报酬分配给社员，具体比例可以因时因地而异。随着生产的增长，劳动报酬应该有适当的增加。有些地方，夏季收获的产品不是农民自给性的、而是商品性的产品，习惯上是把夏季的收获物出卖以后，用来作为秋收前的生产投资的；在这种情况下，当然不能机械执行少扣多分，而影响秋收以前的生产投资。
    必须照章留足公益金，这也是分配给社员消费的，使缺乏劳力的社员（包括“五保户”）能够得到必要的照顾。必要时，在公益金之外，还可以抽一部分作为个别社员土地报酬之用。
    4、社的公积金在一般情况下，都应该留下适当数量。如果收入增加不多，公积金就不宜留得过多，遇到灾荒可以少留或者不留。用于基本建设的到期债务（包括银行、信用社贷款和社员投资）和到期应该偿还的入社生产资料的价款，应该由公积金项下偿还，不要随便拖欠，失掉信用。如果全部归还确有困难，也应该和有关方面充分协商，议定解决的办法。
    此外，夏收分配不是年终决算，而只是预分性质。并且，有些地方，有些合作社，一年有几次收成。为了简便起见，有些地方采取了预支的形式，把收入的一部或者大部分配给社员，按照前后两次预支之间的这段时间内，每个社员所得劳动日的多少，来决定各人预支多少。这种办法可供各地参考。
    二、对于那些收入比入社前可能减少的社员，必须从适当安排劳动、实行互助互济和执行互利政策等方面给以照顾，使他们各尽所长、各得其所，尽量争取不减少收入，以至增加收入。
    1、有些社员因为缺乏劳力而减少收入，其中有些家庭还有人可以参加辅助劳动的，应该尽量吸收他们参加社内的辅助劳动，也可以把一定地块的零活包给他们去做；在社员同意之下，还可以允许他们多留一些自留地，充分发挥这些辅助劳力的作用。有些有条件经营养猪等家庭副业的，应该帮助他们解决发展副业当中的困难。有些因为生病或者其他原因，单纯从安排劳动方面难以完全解决困难，但又不够“五保户”条件的，应该从公益金中给以适当的照顾。那些劳力在外、家庭生活困难、向来依靠土地收入作为一部分生活来源的，可以按照社章规定给以适当的土地报酬。
    2、有些社员生产技术比较高，因为合作社分工不当或者记工不合理而减少收入的，应该改进这些缺点，发挥他们的特长，适当地提高技术劳动的工分，使他们能够得到合理的收入。
    3、有些社员过去依靠农业以外的生产维持生活（如赶车、做木匠、石匠、小贩、临时工、渔民等），当这些生产由农业社统一经营以后，收入分配的办法不尽合理，因而使这些社员减少收入的，可以允许他们继续经营过去的生产，收入归个人自得，由社抽收一部分公积金；在合作社供给原材料或者生产工具已折价入社的条件下，也可以由社与个人按比例分红。抽公积金多少和分红比例多少，由双方协商决定。
    4、有些社员属于比较富裕的村庄，当这些富村和别的村庄合组在一个农业合作社以后，富村和穷村实行统一分配，因而富村的社员收入减少。对这种村庄，可以在包产提奖方面，给予适当的照顾，也可以采取一部分或者大部分生产事业由他们单独经营、自负盈亏的办法来解决矛盾。至于这种联村社是否需要进一步分开建社，应该在有利生产和有利团结的原则下，由群众根据他们自己的意愿去决定。
    5、有些富裕中农，过去占有较多较好的果树、鱼塘、桑园、苇地、竹林等生产资料，收入较多，入社以后，他们的收入减少了。对这种社员，在社员同意的条件下，可以把他们原来的生产资料的一部分或者大部分包给他们经营，而在包产方面给以适当的照顾，或者规定一定的比例，收益由合作社与承包者按比例分红。
    如期归还入社生产资料的价款和投资，并且支付给他们以应得的利息，也是调节富裕中农的收入的一个办法。如果生产资料折价按当时的市价确是过低的，还应该适当调整，使之趋于合理。
    实行上述各项办法，是合乎情理的。农业合作社的分配原则，基本上是接劳取酬。但对于一部分具有特殊情况的社员应该给以必要的照顾，使之各得其所；这种照顾随着农业社生产的发展和收入的增加，将会逐步失去其必要性。而在农业社初办的几年内，这样做，更可以取得贫农和下中农支持拥护，也能够更好地团结一部分富裕农民，做到进一步团结住全体社员，有效地发展生产，使合作社日益巩固起来。
    三、合理地分配粮食，是一个很重要的问题。农业社分配粮食的原则应该是：首先留下必需的种籽和饲料，并且保证完成国家应该征购的任务，然后按照“三定”标准留下全体社员家庭所需要的口粮，如果还有多余的粮食，应该分给劳动比较多的社员。超产奖励也应该配给一部分或者大部分粮食，使超产的生产队得到适当的照顾，以刺激农民的生产积极性。
    目前秋收年景尚未定局，农业社在分配夏粮的时候，应该照顾到全年的需要，作出适当的安排。计算留用夏粮的消费时间，一般以接上秋熟为限，夏粮占全年粮食产量比重较大的地方，特别是秋收作物容易遭灾的地方，计算留用夏粮的时间可以适当放长一点。
    有的地方，有些合作社，在全社口粮总量不超过国家规定的条件下，按照社员年龄大小、劳力强弱规定不同的口粮标准进行分配，儿童的口粮标准略低一些，成年男女较高一些，全劳力再高一些，这种办法也有参考价值。对老年人、产妇、乳妇和婴儿，可以多分配一些细粮，少分配一些粗粮，以示照顾。
    对那些劳动日做的不多，不能按标准分够口粮的社员，合作社一方面应该留下他们的口粮，并且用公益金给其中某些人以必要的照顾；另一方面，在他们还没有现金来购买这些口粮以前，也不要随便赊借给他们，以免造成许多“超支户”和“分空户”，增加合作社的困难。如果合作社资金周转不开，可以把这些粮食卖给国家作为周转粮。对缺粮社员可发给周转粮证，以便凭证按统销价格买回粮食。
    四、收益分配是涉及每个社员切身利益的问题。因此，必须充分发扬民主，通过群众的协商讨论来解决可能发生的各种矛盾。分配时不妨提出几个方案，让群众来比较选择。所有的困难都应该向群众摆出来，让大家来斟酌研究，商议解决的办法。有些只涉及某一部分社员特殊利益的问题，也应该尽量征求这一部分社员的同意，然后做出决定。
    在夏收分配中，必须认真查对合作社的账目，凡是检查出贪污、挪用、浪费、制度混乱等问题，应该迅速地通过群众，恰当加以处理，以利全社的团结，不要等问题堆积起来，等到民主整社的时候再做总的解决。　1957年6月14日
