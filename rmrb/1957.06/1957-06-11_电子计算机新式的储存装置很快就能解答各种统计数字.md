　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th - The Electronic Machine Model Laboratory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has designed a new type of storage device for electronic computers that can be used and preserved for a long time and can store a large amount of materials. Using this device, it can check and process materials equivalent to millions of pages of ordinary books per hour.
　　According to this method, better rapid intelligence and planning statistics machines can be manufactured. The efficiency of this machine will greatly exceed the most modern similar machines made in the United States and the Soviet Union. It can build interpreting machines and make it possible to automate complex production processes.
　　This was reported in a recent article in the Soviet "Industrial Economics Newspaper." The article said that the basic part of this device is paper printed with metal patterns on both sides. In places on the paper where there is a metal layer, numerical or textual material can be recorded in binary code in a simple manner. Then thousands of these papers printed with metal patterns are tightly pressed into paper blocks like thick books and stored.
　　When in use, you can query using electrical impulses. The electrical impulses can automatically "find", "read" and "notify" the querier of the information needed with clearly printed text according to the querier's signal. Compared with ordinary storage devices—magnetic tape, negatives, or punched paper tape—this device occupies much less volume and has a much larger number of recorded items. Ordinary storage devices require mechanical movement during use, and the magnetic tape, negatives, or punched paper tape pass through the relevant parts of the machine, which is often easily damaged and affects the speed. The new device does not have this disadvantage. The use and preservation period of these paper blocks printed with metal patterns is virtually unlimited.
　　Using this method of recording materials, materials can be checked at a very fast speed, tens of thousands of sheets can be checked per second.
　　With this device, operators can comprehensively analyze the work of various enterprises in a certain industrial sector or economic region, or solve the problem of the most reasonable use of various equipment and other industrial reserves within a few hours without leaving the calculation and solution machine connected to these paper block storage libraries. If all the statistics of more than 200,000 industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union are recorded on this paper, then answers to various questions can be obtained in just a few minutes, such as what is the average total output value indicator, what is the profit distribution status of some related enterprises, and so on.

### 电子计算机新式的储存装置很快就能解答各种统计数字

　　电子计算机新式的储存装置很快就能解答各种统计数字
    新华社莫斯科10日电  苏联科学院电子机器模型实验所为电子计算机设计出了一种可以长期使用和保存、而且可以大量储存材料的新式储存装置。利用这种装置每小时可以查对和处理相当于普通书本几百万页的材料。
    依据这种方法，可以制造更好的快速情报和计划统计机器，这种机器的效率会大大超过美国制和苏联制的最新式的同类机器，可以建造口译机器，并且有可能对复杂的生产过程进行自动化控制。
    这是苏联“工业经济报”最近发表的一篇文章报道的。文章说，这种装置的基本部分是两面印着金属纹的纸张。在纸上有金属层的地方可以用简便方法以二进位码子记下数字或文字材料。然后把成千张这种印了金属纹的纸紧紧地压成像一本本厚书的纸块储存起来。
    使用时，只要利用电脉冲就可以查询。电脉冲能按照查询者的讯号自动“找寻”、“读出”和用叙述明确清楚的打印出来的文字“通知”查询者所需的情报。与一般的储存装置——磁带、底片、或打孔纸带相比，这种装置所占体积小得多，而记载事项的数目则多得多。一般储存装置在使用时需要作机械地移动，磁带、底片或打孔纸带通过机器的有关部分，这样往往容易损坏，对速度也有影响。新装置则无此弊病。这些印了金属纹的纸块的使用和保存期限，实际上是无限的。
    使用这种记载材料方法，可以用极快的速度查材料，每秒钟可以查几万张。
    有了这种装置，操作者可以不离开同这些纸块储存库联在一起的计算解答机器，而在几小时内对某一工业部门或经济地区中各企业的工作作出全面分析，或解决最合理地利用各种装备和其他工业后备的问题。如果把苏联二十多万个工业企业的一切统计数字都记在这种纸上，那么只需要几分钟就可以得到各种问题的解答，如总产值平均指标是多少，一些彼此有关的企业的利润分配状况如何等。
