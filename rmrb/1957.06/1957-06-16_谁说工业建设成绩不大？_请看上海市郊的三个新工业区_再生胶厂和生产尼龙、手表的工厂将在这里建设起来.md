Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15th (Xinhua News Agency reporter He Changhua, Xu Fangyi reports): Three new industrial zones are currently being built in the suburbs of Shanghai. In the new industrial zones, dozens of small and medium-sized electromechanical, chemical, and instrument factories will be built. The preliminary planned land area of ​​these three industrial zones is approximately 9,000 mu, accounting for one-sixth of Shanghai's existing industrial land.

The reporter drove to inspect the sites of these new industrial zones.

In the Taopu Industrial Zone, which is taking shape, a row of new red factory buildings appears before our eyes. This is Shanghai's new chemical industry zone. The saccharin factory, dyeing and finishing factory, dye factory, and gold pen factory that have already been built are adjacent to each other. In the distance, one sees China's rare reclaimed rubber factory. A director of the Taishan Organic Chemical Factory accompanied us on a tour of the saccharin manufacturing equipment. About 90% of the domestically produced saccharin in the country is produced here. The famous Huafu Gold Pen Factory is also building a new factory here because the celluloid used for the pen barrel is flammable. It will produce more than 2.6 million Huafu, Xinmin, Hero, and other brand gold pens and fountain pens annually. The new industrial zone also has a large area of ​​vacant land. The comrade in charge of overall planning from the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Construction Bureau, who accompanied the reporter on the tour, said: A batch of chemical factories producing nylon, plexiglass, raw materials, etc. will be built on the vacant land here.

The car drove through the Pengpu Industrial Zone—the future electromechanical industrial zone. Looking out from the window, the reporter saw groups of wooden boats transporting bricks, stones, and bamboo from the small river. The workers constructing the new industrial zone are first building their own sheds. The large-scale supporting workshop of the Huatong Switch Factory, which started construction the earliest, is already leveling the site. The comrade in charge of overall planning spread out the planning map on the ground and said that the China Iron Factory, the only factory in the country producing 50-ton and 100-ton paper-making machines, and the Shenhe Foundry, which produces large castings and forgings, will also be built here this year.

The reporter bypassed nearly half of Shanghai's suburbs from the northern suburbs and finally arrived at the Caohejing Industrial Zone. This is the future instrument industry zone, and it will produce instruments such as electro-optical analytical balances, photoelectric colorimeters, thermometers, and pressure gauges. Currently, road rollers are paving a trunk road that closely connects the new industrial zone with the urban area. The new factory building of the Pufa Instrument Factory, famous for producing drawing instruments, has already started construction, and scaffolding has been erected on the vacant land. The comrade in charge of overall planning pointed to the distance and said: China's modern watch factory will be built there. It will be able to produce tens of thousands of watches every year.

According to the reporter's understanding, most of the factories in the three new industrial zones were relocated and expanded from the city. Many of their old factories were located in the alleys of the city, with small and crowded factory buildings, and their development was greatly restricted. Some factories also released gases that harmed the health of citizens. After the new factories are built, all new or expanded investment can generally be recovered within one month, six months, or one year.

　　谁说工业建设成绩不大？
　　请看上海市郊的三个新工业区
　　再生胶厂和生产尼龙、手表的工厂将在这里建设起来
    新华社上海15日电　新华社记者贺昌华、徐方义报道：目前上海郊外正在兴建三个新的工业区。在新的工业区里，将要建设起几十个中小型的机电、化工、仪表工厂。这三个工业区初步规划的土地面积约九千亩，占上海现有工业用地的六分之一。
    记者曾驱车观看了这些新工业区的现场。
    在初具规模的桃浦工业区，一片红色的新厂房呈现在眼前。这里是上海新的化学工业区，已经建设起来的糖精厂、漂染厂、染料厂和金笔厂毗邻相接，远远望去，那边是我国罕有的再生胶厂。泰山有机化工厂的一位厂长陪同我们参观了制造糖精的设备，全国约90％的国产糖精都在这里生产。著名的华孚金笔厂，因为笔杆用的赛璐珞是易燃品，也在这里建设起新工厂，年产华孚、新民、英雄等牌号的金笔、钢笔二百六十多万支。新工业区还留下大片空地。陪同记者参观的上海市规划建筑管理局担任总体规划工作的同志说：在这里的空地上，将要建设一批出产尼龙、有机玻璃、原药等化学工厂。
    汽车在彭浦工业区——未来的机电工业区行驶。记者从窗口望出去，成群的木船从小河里运来了砖头、石子和毛竹，建设新工业区的工人们首先在建造他们自己的工棚。动工最早的华通开关厂规模很大的配套车间，已经在平整场地。担任总体规划工作的同志在地上摊开了规划图，他说，今年这里还要建设全国唯一生产五十吨和一百吨造纸机的中华铁工厂，以及生产大型铸件锻件的慎和翻砂厂。
    记者从北郊绕过将近半个上海的郊区，最后来到漕河泾工业区。这里是未来的仪表工业区，将来要出产电光分析天平、光电比色计、温度计、压力计等仪表。现在，压路机正在开辟一条把新工业区同市区紧密连接起来的干道。出产绘图仪器著名的普发仪器厂的新厂房已经开始动工，空地上搭起了脚手架。担任总体规划工作的同志指着远远的地方说：我国现代化的手表厂就要建设在那里。它每年能出产手表十几万只。
    据记者了解：三个新工业区的工厂，大部分都是从市内迁来扩建的。它们的旧厂很多是座落在市内的弄堂里，厂房狭小拥挤，发展受到很大的限制，有些厂排出的气体还伤害市民的健康。新厂建设起来以后，一般在一个月、半年或一年的时间内，就可以收回全部新建或扩建的投资。
