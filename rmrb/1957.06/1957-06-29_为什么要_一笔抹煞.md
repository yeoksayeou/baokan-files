Why "Write Off Completely"?
　　Lǐ Líng

　　Comrade Wu Zuguang mentioned in his article "On the Leadership of Drama Work" in this year's "Drama News" No. 11: "Since liberation, in any artistic work position... 'cultivating new talents' has become a frequently uttered phrase. But let's look at the facts before us. Whether on the Peking Opera stage... those who are active and leave a relatively deep impression on the audience... how many are new talents 'cultivated' in the eight years since liberation? ... Speaking of new talents, they are truly few and far between, pitifully few."

　　"We all talk about the so-called 'superiority of the socialist system,' but what has it demonstrated in terms of cultivating literary and artistic talents?" "And how should we explain the specific phenomenon of the scarcity of new talents on the literary and artistic front?"

　　He believes that "the reason for this consequence... generally speaking, is a leadership problem."

　　I don't know much about the situation in opera, drama, folk art, film... However, what Wu refers to is not just drama, but "any kind of artistic work position" and "the literary and artistic front." Therefore, I think it is within the scope of Wu's article to offer some explanation from the perspective of music work (only discussing Western music in music, and only the performer part of it).

　　Everyone knows that in recent years, the music world has witnessed several unprecedented and internationally shocking events, namely Fu Cong's award in the Chopin Piano Competition, Liu Shikun's award in the Liszt Piano Competition, and Li Xuequan's award in the flute competition. These young musicians did not achieve their victories by chance. In many respects (not all), these people's achievements have surpassed the boundaries previously reached by their predecessors (domestically).

　　Secondly, just in Beijing (excluding Shanghai and other places), there are young talents like Lou Qian'gui, Wen Kezheng, Su Fengjuan, Li Bi, Luo Xinzhu, Wei Qixian, Liu Shufang, Liang Meizhen, Zou Dehua... in vocal music, and Li Mingqiang (piano), Han Xianguang (horn), Yang Bingsun (violin), Liu Qi (bassoon), Fang Guoqing (percussion), Sheng Zhongguo (violin), Zhu Yaozhou (trumpet), Bian Zhenguo (trumpet), Wang Lei (cello)... in instrumental music. Many of these people have won international competition awards (which are by no means easy to obtain), and some are quickly competing with their international peers. Many of these wind instrument specialists far exceed the achievements of the previous generation.

　　Eight or nine out of ten of these young people were "cultivated" in schools or art troupes after liberation. People like Liu Shikun and Sheng Zhongguo are still studying at the affiliated middle school of the Central Conservatory of Music, and Fu Cong is still studying in Poland. Most of the young people studying wind instruments are taking lessons with experts. They are definitely not those who "enjoyed great fame before liberation."

　　Many of our older music workers often lament that they were born a little too early and infinitely envy the happiness of this generation of children. In just eight short years, we have built five or six music middle schools (compared to that "pitiful" one youth class in the past) and six or seven music colleges (compared to only two in the past). Many children with musical talent have the opportunity to receive formal, rigorous music education at a very early age (because they are older, there are many difficulties). In recent years, these schools have indeed cultivated many new talents with a relatively solid foundation. Secondly, although many art troupes do not train new talents as strictly as schools, they have also cultivated some young singers who are loved by people, such as Luo Tianchan and Cai Huanzhen.

　　These alone are enough to illustrate the undeniable achievements of the short eight years.

　　Yes, many of our excellent and renowned veteran actors such as Ma Sicong, Yu Yixuan, Zhou Xiaoyan, Wu Leyi, Li Zhishu, Zhang Quan and other comrades are still widely loved, which is especially valuable. There are still many serious shortcomings in the cultural leadership departments' concern, support, and help for these extremely talented performers to maximize their strength, which urgently needs to be overcome in the rectification movement.

　　However, many new actors have indeed "emerged in large numbers" under the education of some older predecessors, emitting a shining light.

　　Many of us older people who are engaged in symphony orchestra work (the so-called collective actors) remember very clearly; compared with the unique, incomplete China Symphony Orchestra before liberation and the large and small orchestras and bands that have sprung up everywhere today, the feeling is very deep.

　　A few days ago, I went with Huang Yijun, the conductor of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and Zhu Chongzhi, who was the principal cellist in the China Symphony Orchestra, to see the performance of "From the New World Symphony." The result was truly astonishing. Although there were still shortcomings, compared with the level of the orchestra back then, it was more than a short distance.

　　"It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." The cultivation of talent is not as easy as a sow giving birth to piglets. However, in a short period of time, it is not as bleak as Comrade Wu Zuguang said.

　　We cannot disregard the facts, or only see one side, and then write off completely, negating the "superiority of the socialist system" entirely. This is not only illogical, but also inconsistent with the facts.

### 为什么要“一笔抹煞”

　　为什么要“一笔抹煞”
　　李凌
    吴祖光同志在今年“戏剧报”第十一号“谈戏剧工作的领导问题”文中提及：“解放以来，无论在任何一种艺术工作岗位上……‘培养新人’成为经常挂在口头上的字句。但是我们看一看眼前的事实，无论在京剧舞台上……那些活跃着的，留给观众比较深刻的印象的，……有几个是解放八年‘培养’出来的新人呢？……谈到新人，那真是寥寥可数，少得可怜”。
    “我们谁都会谈所谓‘社会主义制度的优越性’，可是它在培养文学艺术人材这一方面表现了什么呢？”“而文艺战线上独独新人寥落的具体现象我们又该如何解释呢”？
    他认为“造成这样的后果的原因……总的说来，这是一个领导问题”。
    戏曲、话剧、曲艺、电影……方面的情况，我了解不多，不过吴文所指，不单是戏剧，而是“任何一种艺术工作岗位上”，是“文艺战线上”。所以，我想从音乐工作上（只谈音乐上的西洋音乐，又只是其中的演员部分）有所解释，也是没有越出吴文的范围的。
    谁都知道，近几年来，音乐界出现过几桩前所未有的、惊震国际的事情，那就是傅聪的萧邦钢琴比赛获奖、刘诗昆的李斯特钢琴比赛获奖、李学全的长笛比赛获奖。这些青年音乐家之取得胜利，都不是出于侥幸的。这些人的成绩，在许多方面（不是所有方面）来说，都是越过了前人（国内）曾经到达过的境界。
    其次，只在北京所看到的（上海等地未在内）像声乐方面的楼乾贵、温可铮、苏凤娟、李?、罗忻祖、魏启贤、刘淑芳、梁美珍、邹德华……，在器乐方面李名强（钢琴）、韩铣光（圆号）、杨秉荪（小提琴）、刘奇（长管）、方国庆（打击乐）、盛中国（小提琴）、朱尧洲（小号）、边振国（小号）、王砳（大提琴）……等也是比较优秀的年青人材，这些人中有不少获得国际的比赛奖（这种比赛奖是丝毫也不客气的），有些很快就和国际的青年同业进行较量，其中好些管乐专才，远远超过了前一辈的成就。
    这些青年，十之八九是在解放以后才从学校或艺术团体“培养”出来的，像刘诗昆、盛中国等，现在仍然在中央音乐学院附属中学读书，傅聪还在波兰学习。学管乐的青年，大部分都在跟专家上课。的确不是“解放以前久享盛誉”的。
    我们有好些年纪大一点的音乐工作者，常常慨叹自己出生得早了一些，无限羡慕这一代孩子们的幸福。短短的八年，我们已建成了五六所音乐中学（过去只有那“可怜”的一个少年班），六七所音乐院校（过去只两所）。许多有音乐天才的儿童，很早（因为年纪大了，有许多困难）就有机会受到正规的、严格的音乐教育。这几年来，这些学校，的确教养出不少较有基础的新人。其次，有不少艺术团体虽然不像学校那么严格训练新人，但也培养出一些如罗天婵、蔡焕贞那样的得人喜爱的年青歌手。
    仅止这些，也足够说明，短短的八年的不可抹煞的成就。
    是的，我们许多优秀的享有盛誉的老演员如马思聪、喻宜萱、周小燕、吴乐懿、李志曙、张权等同志，至今仍受到广泛的爱戴，这是特别值得珍贵的。文化领导部门对于这些极有才艺的演奏家的关怀、支持、帮助，发挥他们最大的力量上，还存在不少严重的缺点，这也是急需在整风中克服的。
    但是，不少新的演员也的确在好些老前辈的教育下“人材倍出”，发射出辉耀的光芒。
    我们好些较年长的搞交响乐事业（即所谓集体演员）的人记忆得非常清楚；解放前那独一无二、残缺不全的中华交响乐团，和今天到处新生，而且较具规模的大大小小的乐团、乐队相比，感触是很深的。
    前几天我和上海交响乐团的指挥黄贻钧同志，及当年在中华交响乐团任过大提琴首席的朱崇志同志去看“来自新世界交响乐”的演出。那成绩真是使人惊异，虽然犹有不足之处，但和当年的乐团水平相较，何止咫尺呢？
    “十年树木，百年树人”，人材的培养并不是像母猪生小猪那么容易。然而短短的日子里，也并不像吴祖光同志所说的那么满目荒凉。
    不能不顾事实，或者只看到一面，就一笔抹煞，整个地否定了“社会主义制度的优越性”。这不仅不符合逻辑，也不符合事实。
