Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th: President Sukarno said at a mass meeting held in Madiun, East Java, on the afternoon of the 18th that the recently formed National Council is a crystallization of society.

He also said that although the cooperative cabinet he had hoped to form was not possible, he still hoped that the Indonesian people could always live in an atmosphere of mutual assistance and cooperation.

Information Minister Sudibjo said at the meeting that the cabinet and the National Council would become an inseparable "two-in-one" in concretely implementing the decision to abolish the Round Table Conference agreements and striving to recover West Irian.

According to a report by a reporter from Jakarta's "People's Daily," the National Council may be sworn in next week and quickly carry out its tasks.

However, the newspaper said that it appears the opposition is trying to thwart the National Council and is instigating certain groups to obstruct certain people from accepting appointments.

According to Antara News Agency, Abdullah, the representative of the Central Sumatra region who was invited to serve as a member of the National Council, has telegraphed President Sukarno, stating that he refuses to participate in the National Council until relations between the central government and Central Sumatra return to normal.

Mrs. Hilawati Djahran, editor-in-chief of the Jakarta "Indonesian Observer," who was nominated as one of the journalist representatives, and Professor Bahder Djohan, President of the University of Indonesia, who was nominated as a representative of intellectuals, have also expressed their unwillingness to participate in the council.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th: The Indonesian Parliament ended the first debate on the draft emergency law on the evening of the 18th. Parliament began debating the draft law on June 17, and a total of twenty-four members of parliament spoke during the debate.

According to Jakarta's "People's Daily," the opinions of members of various parties were consistent on some issues in their speeches, such as the belief that the people and various democratic institutions such as the Parliament and local councils must supervise the implementation of the emergency law. At the same time, members of all parties generally requested that only two stages be stipulated: a state of emergency and a state of war, and that civil organs be granted the power to declare a state of alert and a state of civil emergency. These members believe that it is unconstitutional for civil organs to hold this privilege.

The government is scheduled to make its first reply on this issue on the 21st.

　　勉勖印度尼西亚人民互助合作
　　苏加诺赞扬民族委员会是社会结晶
　　国会结束关于紧急状态法令草案的第一次辩论
    新华社雅加达19日电　苏加诺总统18日下午在东爪哇的茉莉芬举行的群众大会上说，最近组成的民族委员会是社会的结晶体。
    他还说，虽然他希望组成的合作内阁没有能够组成，但是他仍然希望印度尼西亚人民能够始终生活在互助合作的气氛中。
    情报部长苏迪比约在大会上讲话说，内阁和民族委员会在具体贯彻废除圆桌会议协定的决定和争取收复西伊里安的斗争中，将要成为不可分割的“两位一体”。
    据雅加达“人民日报”记者报道，民族委员会可能在下周内宣誓就职，并且迅速执行它的任务。
    但是这家报纸说，看来反对派正在力图挫败民族委员会，正在唆使某些集团阻挠某些人士接受委任。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，被邀请担任民族委员会委员的中苏门答腊地区代表阿卜杜拉，已经打电报给苏加诺总统，表示在中央和中苏门答腊之间的关系没有恢复正常以前，他拒绝参加民族委员会。
    被提名为记者代表之一、雅加达“印度尼西亚观察家报”主编希拉瓦蒂·迪亚夫人和知识分子代表、印度尼西亚大学校长巴赫德尔·约翰也表示不愿意参加这个委员会。
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚国会18日晚上结束了就紧急状态法令草案进行的第一次辩论。国会是在6月17日开始辩论这个法令草案的，在辩论中一共有二十四名议员发言。
    据雅加达“人民日报”说，各党派议员在发言中，对一些问题的意见是一致的，例如认为人民和国会、地方议会等各种民主机构必须监督紧急状态法令的执行。同时，各党派议员一般都要求只规定紧急状态和战争状态两个阶段，而给予民政机关以宣布戒备状态和民事紧急状态这两个阶段的权力。这些议员认为民政机关掌握这种特权是违反宪法的。
    政府预定在21日对这个问题作第一次答辩。
