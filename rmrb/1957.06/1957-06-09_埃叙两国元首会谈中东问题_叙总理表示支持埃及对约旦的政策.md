It is estimated that the Egyptian and Syrian heads of state will coordinate their policies to resist the attempts of Western countries. After the meeting, President Kuwatly flew to Alexandria and then drove to the Mosart Hospital.

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali told reporters: "Syria will support any decision made by Egypt regarding the issue of financial aid to Jordan."

    埃叙两国元首会谈中东问题
    叙总理表示支持埃及对约旦的政策
    据新华社8日讯　开罗消息：纳赛尔总统6月7日同叙利亚总统库阿特利进行了三小时的会谈。
    据中东通讯社报道，他们在会谈中讨论了中东的一般事务，特别是阿拉伯国家的问题。
    印度报业托辣斯说，西方国家现在竭力要孤立埃及和叙利亚，而且，如果可能的话要建立新的亲西方阵线，估计埃叙两国元首将协调两国的政策以便抵制西方国家的企图。库阿特利总统在会谈以后就乘飞机前往亚历山大港，然后又乘车到莫萨特医院。
    据新华社8日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利对记者说：“叙利亚将支持埃及在给约旦财政援助问题上作出的任何决定”。
    他还说，“叙利亚也支持埃及在万一约旦政府背弃积极中立政策而脱离阿拉伯集团时作出的任何决定”。
