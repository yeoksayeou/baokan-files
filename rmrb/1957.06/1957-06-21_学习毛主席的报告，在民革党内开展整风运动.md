　　Studying Chairman Mao's Report, Launching a Rectification Movement within the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
　　Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

　　Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been officially published. It points out the path for correctly handling contradictions among the people in our country today. This is a great event in our country's political life and has immeasurable significance for promoting the advancement of our country's socialist cause. All comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should deeply study this great document, stand firm, recognize the direction, distinguish right from wrong, and refute all reactionary and erroneous statements and actions.

　　In his speech, Chairman Mao put forward six political criteria for judging the correctness of our statements and actions, and pointed out that only when the opinions and criticisms put forward by the democratic parties and the Communist Party meet these six political criteria can they play a positive role in mutual supervision. Recently, in helping the Chinese Communist Party with its rectification campaign, some right-wing elements within our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang have also exposed many absurd remarks that violate the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao. This is contrary to our party's political line of serving socialism. We must draw a clear line between ourselves and these erroneous ideas, consolidate our party's correct ideological leadership, so that we can continue to advance with the Communist Party and be qualified for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

　　I believe that while continuing to help the Communist Party with its rectification campaign, our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must immediately launch a rectification movement within the party, focusing on exposing and criticizing right-wing elements who oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. I call on comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to actively carry out the rectification movement within the party; and I sincerely hope that the Chinese Communist Party will give us full support and help, and lead us in carrying out this rectification movement well!

　　学习毛主席的报告，在民革党内开展整风运动
　　中国国民党革命委员会主席　李济深
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话正式发表了，它指出了我国当前怎样正确处理人民内部矛盾的道路。这是我国政治生活中的一个伟大事件，对于推动我国社会主义事业的前进具有不可估量的重大意义。民革全体同志应当深入学习这个伟大的文献，站稳立场，认清方向，辨明是非，驳斥一切反动和错误的言论和行动。
    毛主席在讲话中，对于怎样判断我们言论和行动的是非，提出了六条政治标准，并且指出各民主党派和共产党之间所提的意见，所作的批判，唯有合乎这六条政治标准，才能发挥互相监督的积极作用。最近在帮助中共整风中，我们民革内部也暴露了一些右派分子利用这一机会发出许多违反毛主席所提出的六条政治标准的荒谬言论。这是与我们党为社会主义服务的政治路线背道而驰的。我们必须与这些错误思想划清界限，巩固我们党的正确思想领导，才能跟着共产党继续前进，才能具备长期共存，互相监督的条件。
    我认为我们民革在继续帮助共产党整风的同时，必须立即在党内开展一个以揭露、批判右派分子反对共产党领导、反对社会主义、反对无产阶级专政为中心内容的整风运动。我号召民革同志积极进行党内整风；更诚恳地希望中国共产党给我们以充分的支持和帮助，领导我们搞好这个整风运动！
