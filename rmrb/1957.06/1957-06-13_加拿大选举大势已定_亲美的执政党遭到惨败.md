Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, June 11th: In the Canadian national election held yesterday (to elect 265 members of the House of Commons), the Liberal Party, which has been in power in Canada for twenty-two years, suffered a crushing defeat, and the Progressive Conservative Party won.

The Progressive Conservative Party strongly criticized the Liberal government's pro-American policies for harming Canada's interests during the election campaign, and it also put forward a "Canada First" development plan.

So far, three of the total 265 House of Commons seats have not been announced. Among the seats that have been announced, the Progressive Conservative Party won 110 seats, the Liberal Party won 103 seats, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Socialist Party) won 24 seats, and the Social Credit Party won 19 seats.

Compared with the 1953 election, the Liberal Party lost more than 60 seats. In that election, the Liberal Party won a total of 170 seats. Nine cabinet members of the current Liberal cabinet lost their seats in the election. Liberal Prime Minister St. Laurent and Foreign Minister Pearson were re-elected as members of parliament.

According to the Canadian constitution, any party must have more than half of the seats in the 265-seat House of Commons, that is, at least 133 seats, to form a government. At present, the Progressive Conservative Party has not won this absolute majority. Unless the other two minority parties—the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the Social Credit Party—are willing to form a coalition government with the Progressive Conservative Party, another election will be required.

The Liberal Party's defeat in this election is considered a powerful manifestation of the widespread and strong anti-American sentiment in Canada. People are dissatisfied with the Liberal Party's pro-American policies. Recently, the incident of the U.S. authorities driving Canadian Ambassador to Egypt Norman to his death, as well as the U.S. seizure of Canada's international wheat market, have particularly aroused indignation in Canada.

### 加拿大选举大势已定  亲美的执政党遭到惨败

　　加拿大选举大势已定
　　亲美的执政党遭到惨败
    新华社11日讯  渥太华消息：在昨天举行的加拿大全国选举（改选二百六十五名众议员）中，在加拿大执政二十二年之久的自由党遭到惨败，进步保守党获得了胜利。
    进步保守党在这次竞选运动曾经强烈指责自由党政府的亲美政策损害了加拿大的利益，它并且提出了“加拿大第一”的发展计划。
    到现在为止，在一共二百六十五名众议员议席中，还有三个席位没有揭晓。在已经揭晓的席位中，进步保守党获得一百一十席，自由党得一百零三席，合作联盟（社会党）得二十四席，社会信用党得十九席。
    与1953年的大选比较，自由党失去了六十多席，在那一次选举中，自由党共得一百七十席。自由党现内阁的九名阁员都在选举中落选。自由党总理圣劳伦和外交部长皮尔逊重新被选为议员。
    依照加拿大宪法规定，任何政党必须在众议院的二百六十五席中拥有超过半数的议席，即至少一百三十三席才能组织政府，目前进步保守党还没有获得这个绝对多数，除非其他的两个少数党——合作联盟和社会信用党——愿意与进步保守党组织联合政府，不然将需要再举行一次选举。
    自由党在这次选举中的失败，被认为是加拿大国内普遍强烈的反美情绪的一次有力表现。人们不满自由党的亲美政策。最近，美国当局逼死加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼事件，以及美国抢占加拿大的国际小麦市场，特别在加拿大激起愤慨。
