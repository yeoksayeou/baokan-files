Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: The Government of the People's Republic of China issues a statement protesting the United States' violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement by bringing new-style weapons into South Korea. The full text is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China Protesting the United States' Violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement by Bringing New-Style Weapons into South Korea, June 27, 1957

On June 21, 1957, the United Nations Command unilaterally announced the abandonment of its obligations under Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which stipulated that no reinforcing weapons should be brought into Korea, and declared that it would bring new-style weapons into South Korea. This is a serious act of provocation by the United States, blatantly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and threatening peace in Korea and the Far East. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on June 26, 1957, strongly protesting the illegal act of the United Nations Command in blatantly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and suggesting that a conference of relevant countries be convened to discuss the Korean situation. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the solemn position and active proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Since the Korean armistice, the Korean-Chinese side has consistently strictly abided by and maintained the armistice agreement and has made every effort to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. However, the United Nations Command, under the manipulation of the United States, has repeatedly rejected the reasonable proposals of the Korean-Chinese side, obstructed the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and continuously violated the armistice agreement, leaving the Korean situation in a state of prolonged instability. The United States forcibly detained Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, illegally shipped weapons and ammunition to arm the Syngman Rhee army, and consistently obstructed the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea. This time, the U.S. side unilaterally abolished Article 13(b) of the armistice agreement, which is a further development of a series of illegal activities by the United States. The Chinese government lodges a strong protest with the United States against this illegal act that seriously violates the armistice agreement.

This action by the United States is not only a blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement but also a threat to peace in the Far East and the world. In order to exacerbate international tensions, the United States is vigorously pursuing a policy of establishing missile and atomic bases around the world. Shortly after the U.S. Air Force stationed missile-equipped units in Taiwan, which is our country's territory, it violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and decided to bring new-style weapons into South Korea to threaten the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and suppress the South Korean people. This is not only a serious provocation to the Korean and Chinese people but also a serious provocation to all peace-loving countries and people. The Chinese and Korean people will never allow the U.S. plot to undermine peace in Korea and the Far East to succeed. All peace-loving countries and people must not allow the U.S. plot to succeed.

The Chinese government solemnly declares that the Korean Armistice Agreement embodies the firm will of the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world to safeguard peace in Korea and the Far East and will not allow anyone to undermine it. The United States must continue to abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement; any unilateral action is illegal and invalid, and the Chinese government and people will never agree to it. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of its illegal actions. Other countries of the United Nations Command that follow the United States in taking this action that seriously violates the armistice agreement cannot escape the condemnation of the people of the world and the responsibility they should bear. The Chinese government believes that active measures should be taken to stop the serious situation caused by the United States' unilateral violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to ensure the continued andeffective implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to further seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Chinese government fully supports the Korean government's proposal to convene a conference of all countries concerned with the Korean issue.

　　反对严重破坏朝鲜停战协定
    我国政府向美国提出强烈抗议
    完全支持朝鲜政府的立场和召开有关国家会议的建议
    新华社27日讯  中华人民共和国政府抗议美国破坏朝鲜停战协定以新式武器运进南朝鲜的声明。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府抗议美国破坏朝鲜停战协定以新式武器运进南朝鲜的声明  1957年6月27日
    1957年6月21日，联合国军片面宣布废弃它对朝鲜停战协定第十三款中关于不得以增援性武器运进朝鲜的规定所承担的义务，并且宣称它将以新式武器运进南朝鲜。这是美国公然破坏朝鲜停战协定、威胁朝鲜和远东和平的严重挑衅行为。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府1957年6月26日发表声明强烈抗议联合国军公然破坏朝鲜停战协定的非法行为，建议召开有关国家会议讨论朝鲜局势。中华人民共和国政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的严正立场和积极建议。
    自从朝鲜停战以来，朝中方面一贯严格遵守和维护停战协定，并且尽了一切努力争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。但是联合国军方面在美国操纵下却一再拒绝朝中方面的合理建议、阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，并且不断地破坏停战协定，使朝鲜局势长期处于不稳定状态。美国强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，非法运进武器弹药武装李承晚军队，并且一贯阻挠中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的活动。这一次美方片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，是美国一系列非法活动的进一步发展。对于美方这一严重破坏停战协定的非法行为，中国政府向美国提出强烈抗议。
    美国这一行动不仅是对朝鲜停战协定的公然违反，而且也是对于远东和世界和平的威胁。为了加剧国际紧张局势，美国正在世界各地大力推行建立导弹和原子基地政策。美国在以装备导弹的空军部队进驻我国的领土台湾后不久，又破坏朝鲜停战协定，决定以新式武器运进南朝鲜来威胁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和镇压南朝鲜人民。这不仅是对朝鲜和中国人民的严重挑衅，而且也是对一切爱好和平的国家和人民的严重挑衅。中朝两国人民绝不能容许美国破坏朝鲜和远东和平的阴谋得逞。一切爱好和平的国家和人民，也绝不能容许美国的阴谋得逞。
    中国政府严正宣告：朝鲜停战协定体现着朝中两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民维护朝鲜和远东和平的坚决意志，绝不容许任何人加以破坏。美国必须继续遵守停战协定的一切条款；任何片面行动都是非法的和无效的，中国政府和人民决不同意。美国政府必须对它的非法行为的一切后果负全部责任。联合国军方面追随美国作出这一严重破坏停战协定的行为的其他国家，也不能逃脱世界人民的谴责和他们所应负的责任。中国政府认为应该采取积极措施来制止由于美国片面破坏朝鲜停战协定而造成的严重局势。为了保证朝鲜停战协定继续有效的实施，为了进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，中国政府完全支持朝鲜政府关于召开与朝鲜问题有关的一切国家的会议的建议。
