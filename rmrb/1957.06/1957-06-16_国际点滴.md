    The Crisis in the British Newspaper Industry
    Due to soaring costs and declining circulation, the British newspaper industry is facing a major crisis.

    The fourth largest daily newspaper in Britain is the Labour Party's "Daily Herald," with a daily circulation of over 1.65 million copies. The fifth largest daily newspaper is the Liberal Party's "News Chronicle," with a daily circulation of over 1.44 million copies. These two daily newspapers are now actively considering a merger. In the past seven months, three smaller daily newspapers have closed down. The circulation of "Reynold's News" has dropped from over 600,000 copies to over 510,000 copies and it is now surviving on subsidies from the Co-operative Party. Britain's largest picture magazine, "Picture Post" (which had a peak circulation of 1.75 million copies per week), has officially decided to cease publication.

    Oxford University's School Spirit
    According to Walker, Vice-Chairman of the British Oxford Hotel and Apartment Association, Oxford University students often fail to comply with dormitory rules, wandering the streets until after midnight. Sometimes they bring women to student residences and school dormitories late at night, disturbing others' sleep. Many students also frequently owe rent, and incidents of furniture damage are countless. Landlords have protested to the Oxford University authorities, demanding compensation.

    英国报业的危机
    由于成本激增、发行数量下降，英国的报业遭遇了重大的危机。
    英国第四家最大的日报是工党的“每日先驱报”，每日销数为一百六十五万多份。第五家最大的日报是自由党报纸“新闻纪事报”，每日销数为一百四十四万多份。现在这两家日报正在积极酝酿合并。在过去七个月中，已有三家较小的日报关门大吉。“雷诺新闻”的销数已由六十余万份下降到五十一万多份，现在靠着合作党的津贴苟延残喘。英国最大的画刊“图画周刊”（最高销数曾达每周一百七十五万份），已经正式决定停刊了。
    牛津大学的校风
    据英国牛津旅馆和公寓联合会副主席华克说，牛津大学学生经常不遵守宿舍规律，他们在晚上十二点还在街上游荡不归。有时在深夜还带些女人到学生住所和学校的宿舍里来，弄得别人不能安眠。许多学生还常欠房租，破坏家具的事件数不胜计。房主们曾向牛津大学当局提出抗议，要求赔偿。
