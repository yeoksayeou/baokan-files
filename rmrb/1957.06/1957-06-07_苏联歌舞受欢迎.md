Budapest in Early Summer

    Soviet Song and Dance Welcomed

Not long after the October events, the Soviet Alexandrov Red Army Choir and Dance Ensemble made a friendly visit to various cities, villages, factories, and farms in Hungary for performances. Recently, the Soviet Red Army Choir and Dance Ensemble, the Pyatnitsky Choir, and the Trade Union Ensemble have also been performing in major theaters and factories in Budapest. Each of these three ensembles has its own characteristics. The Red Army Choir and Dance Ensemble reflects the heroic life of the Soviet army with high artistry, while the other two ensembles faithfully depict the multi-ethnic Russian folk art. Each performance has been warmly praised by the Hungarian people.

    布达佩斯的初夏
    苏联歌舞受欢迎
    十月事件后不久，苏联亚历山大红军歌舞团曾在匈牙利各大城市、乡村、工厂、农庄作了友谊访问演出。最近，苏联红军歌舞团、皮特尼次基文工团和工会文工团又分别在布达佩斯各大剧院和工厂演出。这三个文工团各有特色。红军歌舞团以高度的艺术反映了英勇的苏军的生活，其他两个文工团却忠实地刻画出多民族色彩的俄罗斯民间艺术。每场演出都受到匈牙利人民的热烈赞扬。
