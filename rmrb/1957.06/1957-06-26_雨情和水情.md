Rainfall and Water Conditions

　　In the middle of this month, except for most of the provinces in the Northwest such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu, eastern Inner Mongolia, and the western parts of Liaoning and Jilin provinces where rainfall was relatively low, the rest of the country experienced rainfall of 25 mm or more. The rainfall in the vast areas north of the Huai River to eastern Liaoning and Jilin provinces and south of the Yangtze River was roughly around 50 mm. The rainfall in Guangdong and Guangxi in the Pearl River basin, as well as the Dongting Lake area and parts of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the upper and lower reaches of the Han River, exceeded 100 mm. In the upper reaches of the West River and the lower reaches of the North River, local areas experienced rainfall exceeding 200 mm. Compared with the average rainfall in the same period in previous years, except for most areas of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in the Pearl River basin where rainfall was one to two times higher, and the upper reaches of the Han River where it was 50% higher, the rainfall in other areas was relatively uniform.

　　During this ten-day period, the water levels of all rivers did not experience any major rises, and the water conditions were stable. (Xin Wen)

　　雨情和水情
    本月中旬，全国除西北的新疆、青海、甘肃等省大部，内蒙古东部和辽宁、吉林二省西部降雨较少外，其余各地均有二十五公厘以上的降雨量；淮河以北至辽宁、吉林二省东部和长江以南广大地区的降雨量，大致在五十公厘左右；珠江流域的广东、广西及洞庭湖区和长江上游、汉江上游和下游的部分地区，降雨量超过了一百公厘；西江上游和北江的下游局部地区，降雨量超过了二百公厘。若与历年同期平均降雨量比较，除珠江流域的广东、广西两省的大部地区降雨量多了一至二倍、汉江上游多了50％外，其余各地降雨量都很均匀。
    这一旬，各河水位均无大的涨发，水情平稳。  （心文）
