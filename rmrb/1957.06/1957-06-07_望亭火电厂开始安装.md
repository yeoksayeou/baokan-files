    Wangting Thermal Power Plant Begins Installation
    One of the hubs of the Yangtze River Delta power grid, the first phase of the Wangting Thermal Power Plant has entered the installation stage.
    Currently, two of the four turbine generator foundation projects in the turbine generator workshop have been completed. By the end of this year, the workers will strive to install two generators and three boilers, one of which will enable one turbine generator to start generating electricity.
    The total installed capacity of the first phase of the Wangting Thermal Power Plant is 88,000 kilowatts. The plant is located in the central area of Nanjing-Shanghai, and the electricity it generates will be connected to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Ma'anshan through high-voltage transmission lines, and together with the Xin'an River Hydropower Station in Zhejiang, will form a powerful power grid.

    望亭火电厂开始安装
    长江三角洲电力网的枢纽之一——望亭火力发电厂的第一期工程，已经进入安装阶段。
    现在，汽轮发电机车间的四个汽轮发电机基础工程已经做好了两个。到今年年底，职工们将争取安装好两台发电机，三台锅炉，其中有一台汽轮发电机可以开始发电。
    望亭火力发电厂第一期工程的全部装机容量是八万八千瓩。这个厂处在南京—上海的中心地带，发出的电力将通过高压输电线，同南京、上海、马鞍山连接起来，并且同浙江的新安江水力发电站一起形成一个强大的电力网。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
