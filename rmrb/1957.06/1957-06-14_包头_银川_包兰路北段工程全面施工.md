Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, June 13th. Full-scale construction has begun on the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway.

The Baolan Railway, over 1,000 kilometers long, is currently being built from Baotou and Lanzhou towards Yinchuan in two sections, north and south. The northern section of the project, from Baotou to Yinchuan, is 526 kilometers long. Currently, the track has been laid westward from Baotou to XishanZui, 119 kilometers from Baotou. This area is close to the famous fish production area of ​​western Inner Mongolia, Ulansuhai Lake. The large, plump carp eaten by people in the Beijing and Tianjin areas are mostly supplied from here. Further west of the track-laying project is the Hetao region of the Yellow River, crisscrossed by canals.

The 200-kilometer section of the line from Gongmiaozhi Station, 92 kilometers west of Baotou, to the Sanshenggong Bridge in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, is the key construction area for the northern section of the Baolan Railway this year. This section of the line must cross the four major trunk canals of the Hetao area, Fuxing, Fengji, Yongji, and Huangji, seven times. The canal modification project is progressing actively, and some parts have been largely completed.

The railway extending westward from Baotou will cross the rapid currents of the Yellow River for the first time at Sanshenggong (301 kilometers from Baotou). Then, the railway will proceed south along the terraces between Yinshan Mountain and Helan Mountain, cross the Yellow River again at Sandaokan (399 kilometers from Baotou), and advance towards the Yinchuan Plain. These two large iron bridges over the Yellow River are key projects in the northern section of the Baolan Railway. Preparations for the Sanshenggong Bridge were made earlier, and construction can begin in June. Currently, the bridge troops of the Railway Corps have entered the construction site. A temporary bridge, more than 600 meters long near the main bridge, is nearing completion after two months of intense construction. It will serve the construction of the main bridge.

　　包头——银川
　　包兰路北段工程全面施工
    据新华社包头13日电　包（头）兰（州）铁路北段工程已经全面开始施工。
    全长一千多公里的包兰铁路，目前正由包头和兰州分南、北两段向银川修筑。从包头到银川的北段工程，长五百二十六公里。目前已由包头向西铺轨到达距离包头一百一十九公里的西山咀。这里紧临内蒙古西部著名的鱼产地——乌梁素海，京、津一带人民食用的肥大鲫鱼，多由这里供应。铺轨工程再往西去，就是渠道纵横的黄河河套地区。
    从西距包头九十二公里的公庙子车站，到黄河中游三盛公大桥的一段二百多公里的线路，是包兰铁路北段今年的重点施工地区。这段线路要七次跨越河套地区复兴、丰济、永济、黄济等四大干渠，改渠工程正在积极进行，有的已经大部修建完毕。
    从包头向西伸延的铁路，将在三盛公（距包头三百零一公里）第一次跨过黄河急流，然后铁路循银山和贺兰山中间的台地南进，在三道坎（距包头三百九十九公里）再渡黄河，向银川平原前进。这两座黄河大铁桥是包兰线北段的关键工程。准备工作做得较早的三盛公大桥6月份就可以开始施工。目前，铁道兵的桥梁部队已经进入工地。正桥附近一座全长六百多公尺的便桥工程，经过两个月的紧张施工，已经接近完成。它将为正桥修建工程服务。
