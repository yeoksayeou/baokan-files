To the Editor:

After reading the speech by Mr. Yang Yuqing, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "Political Science Research," published on page 2 of the People's Daily on June 5th, I disagree with some of his views. In the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," I would like to offer some personal opinions for Mr. Yang's consideration.

Mr. Yang believes that the cadres who have joined the workforce in the past eight years are all "sedan chair carriers," which is not in line with the actual situation. I do not deny that "some Communist Party members ride in sedan chairs," and some people are "carrying sedan chairs." But in general, the vast majority of these cadres who joined the revolution in the past eight years, under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party, are serving the people sincerely and working diligently for socialism. As for the Communist Party, it has been striving for the interests and happiness of the Chinese people for thirty-six years as if it were only one day, and has not been "riding in sedan chairs" or acting as overlords of the people. Since the Communist Party never "rides in sedan chairs," how can cadres "carry sedan chairs"? If we must say there is "sedan chair carrying," then it is carrying the people's "sedan chair," carrying the socialist "sedan chair." This kind of "sedan chair" must be carried forever, and of course "the sedan chair carriers are not willing to put down the poles!"

"Everything originates in Beijing, and chaos starts in Beijing." Yes, Beijing is the location of the central authorities, and all major policies, laws, and decrees are formulated, issued, and implemented here. Has it been chaotic? We can look at the facts: the state monopoly of purchase and marketing is unanimously supported by the working people; the suppression of counter-revolutionaries basically eliminated the hidden counter-revolutionary elements; the socialist transformation was welcomed by capitalists with drums and gongs. I won't list more examples; these are the best answers. Of course, our country has a large population, vast territory, and a backward economy and culture, and the situation is complex. In addition, socialist construction is a new thing, and everyone lacks experience, so sometimes the specific links of various policies and systems cannot be adjusted in time. In the implementation, some cadres do not understand the spirit of the policy enough, and their working methods are rigid, so there are certain shortcomings and even mistakes. But these are temporary difficulties in the process of advancement, shortcomings and mistakes in victory. In fact, the Party and the government are trying to overcome these difficulties and correct these shortcomings and mistakes. How can we deny the main achievements and say that it is chaotic or making a mess? Even if it is a "mess," the economic and cultural living standards of the broad masses of working people across the country have improved compared with before liberation in just eight years, and China's international reputation has been unprecedentedly enhanced. What's wrong with that? Now that socialism has been built, what's wrong with that? I think it's very good, and I think the people of the whole country will say it's very good!

"Some people who studied old laws have become ministers and directors. These people should step down. If they don't step down, it's not enough to appease the people's anger. There is another kind of person who should especially step down..." "People who studied old laws" is too general and should be analyzed. Some studied old laws, were attached to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and helped the wicked to do evil, becoming reactionary tools to rule the people and suppress the revolution. Some were engaged in education and research on old laws, but some, although they studied old laws, had long been engaged in the people's revolutionary cause, or had contributed to the people's revolution. Since the situation of people who studied old laws is so complex, we should deal with them properly according to different situations and make different arrangements. In fact, the Party and the government are doing this. It is not impossible for some of them to be ministers and directors. Moreover, the evaluation of a person should not focus on whether they have studied old laws, but should be based on their attitude towards the revolution and the people! It is undeniable that the judicial work has certain shortcomings in the past eight years since the founding of the country, and it still cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation today, which may be related to their work. But even if there are shortcomings, is it necessary to step down? As for the People's Daily, this is the people's own newspaper. Of course, it should promote Marxism-Leninism, promote the Party and the state's policies, report on the construction of the motherland in all aspects, reflect the lives of people of all classes after liberation, and point out the direction of progress and a bright future for the people. How can this be said to be "singing praises"? Similarly, in today's "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the People's Daily should also become a place for "a hundred schools of thought to contend" and a garden for "a hundred flowers to bloom." Mr. Yang believes that it reflects different opinions from all parties and publishes articles of criticism and counter-criticism, which is "collecting" and does not want to "release." I don't know how Mr. Yang understands "letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom." In my opinion, Mr. Yang's statement is to "let one school of thought contend alone" and "let one flower bloom alone." But the People's Daily is truly "releasing" rather than "collecting." As for the so-called "not stepping down is not enough to appease the people's anger," it makes people wonder where this "people's anger" comes from, whether an investigation has been conducted, and what the basis is. What "people's" "anger" is, that is only known to Mr. Yang himself!

"The pen of the literati is naturally against the status quo..." In my opinion, this is not necessarily the case. Not to mention the ancient times, let's talk about Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang in the Qing Dynasty. They not only did not oppose the "status quo" of the Qing Dynasty at that time, but also consolidated and maintained it. Hu Shi before liberation was also like this. He is still attached to and maintaining Chiang Kai-shek's "status quo" and opposing the status quo of People's China. Of course, in the old society, it was a society where a minority ruled and exploited the majority. The vast majority of "literati" were not only ruled, but also frustrated and unemployed, so of course they would oppose the old "status quo" at that time. This has been the case since ancient times. But now, our country has been liberated. As intellectuals who are "literati," they have not only become members of the working people and masters of the country, but also, under the care and arrangement of the Party and the government, have been "placed in their proper positions." Under the Party's policy of "unity, education, and transformation," they have all made progress. In the great cause of socialist construction, the Party has given the "literati" an infinitely broad future. The situation of "literati" in the old society who were unemployed at any time and unemployed after graduation has gone forever. I think that "literati" with a little conscience, as long as they look back at the past, compare the present, and look at the future, they will definitely feel something in their hearts and will definitely say "love the new society and follow the Communist Party forever." Mr. Yang neither looks back at history, nor looks at reality, nor investigates the hearts of the broad masses of "literati," and rashly says that "the pen of the literati is naturally against the status quo, the real literati are against the status quo, and good articles have been against the status quo since ancient times," which is inevitably arbitrary and makes it difficult for people not to feel that he does not even distinguish between the new and old societies! Of course, it is possible and should be to criticize the shortcomings, errors, and unreasonable aspects of the people's "status quo," but this is completely different from opposing the status quo.

Finally, I would like to declare that I am in favor of "releasing," and I am even more in favor of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend," but I oppose only allowing oneself to release alone and not allowing others to release. I think the People's Daily will also give us these "small literati" a small garden to "release" in!

### 我们要永远抬人民的“轿”  抬社会主义的“轿”

专栏：读者来信

    我们要永远抬人民的“轿”  抬社会主义的“轿”编辑同志：
    看到人民日报6月5日第二版所载“政法研究”副总编辑杨玉清先生的发言，我不同意他的一些观点。兹本着“鸣”、“放”精神，提出个人的一些看法，就教于杨先生。
    杨先生认为八年来参加工作的干部，都是些“抬轿子的人”，这是不符实际情况的。我不否认，“有些共产党员坐轿子”，也有一些人是在抬“轿子”。但总的来说，建国八年来参加革命的这些干部，在共产党的培养教育下，绝大部分是在真心诚意地为人民服务，勤勤恳恳地为社会主义劳动；而就共产党来说，是三十六年如一日，一直为着中国人民的利益和幸福而奋斗，并没有“坐轿”，做人民的老爷。共产党既从来不“坐轿”，干部又从何去“抬轿”。如果硬要说是
  “抬轿”的话，那就是抬的人民的
  “轿”，抬的社会主义的“轿”。这种“轿”，永远要抬，当然是“抬轿的人也还不愿放轿杆”了！
    “一切发源于北京，乱搞就从北京乱搞起”。是的，北京是中央所在地，一切重大的方针政策，法律、法令，都在这里制定下达执行。搞乱了没有呢？我们可以来看看事实：统购统销，劳动人民是齐声拥护；肃反运动，把暗藏的反革命分子基本上肃清了；社会主义改造，资本家是敲锣打鼓欢迎。不用多举了，这些就是最好的回答。当然，我国地大人多，经济文化落后，情况复杂，加之社会主义建设又是件新事，大家都缺乏经验，所以有时在各项政策、制度的具体环节上不能够及时调整，在贯彻执行中，有些干部领会政策精神不够，工作方式生硬，是存在着一定的缺点甚至错误的。但这是前进中的暂时困难，是胜利中的缺点错误，事实上党和政府都在力求克服这些困难，纠正这些缺点错误，怎能就此否定了成绩的主要面，说成是乱搞、搞乱了呢？就算是“乱搞”吧，仅仅搞了八年，全国广大劳动人民的经济文化生活水平已较解放前改善，我国国际声誉空前提高，这有什么不好？现在已经搞出了社会主义，又有什么不好？我看是好得很，我想，全国人民也会说好得很！
      “一些学旧法的人做了部长、司长。这些人应该下台，不下台不足以平民愤。还有一种人特别应该下台，……”“学旧法的人”，太笼统，应该加以分析。有的学了旧法，是依附国民党反动派，助纣为虐，做了统治人民、镇压革命的反动工具；有的则从事旧法的教育、研究工作；但也有的虽学了旧法，早就从事了人民革命事业，或者对人民革命亦有过贡献。学旧法的人情况既这样复杂，就应分别情况，妥善处理，不同安排；实际上，党和政府也是这样做的。其中有些人，当部长、司长，也就未尝不可了。何况对一个人的评价，不应从是否学过旧法着眼，而应以对革命、对人民的态度为依归呢！不可否认，建国八年来，司法工作是有着一定的缺点，今天也还赶不上形势发展的需要，这可能与他们的工作不无关系。但纵然有缺点，是否就非下台不可了呢？至于人民日报，这是人民自己的报纸，当然应该宣传马克思列宁主义，宣传党和国家的政策，报道祖国各方面建设的情况，反映解放后各阶层人民的生活，给人民指出前进方向、光明前景，这怎能说是“歌功颂德”！同样，在这“鸣”“放”的今天，人民日报自亦应成为“百家争鸣”的处所，“百花齐放”的园地。杨先生认为它反映了各方不同的意见，登载了批评和反批评的文章，就是在“收”，而不想“放”。未知杨先生对“百家争鸣、百花齐放”，是如何理解。在我看来，杨先生的这种说法，是要“一家独鸣”、“独花孤放”。而人民日报却真正是在“放”，而不是“收”。至所谓“不下台不足以平民愤”，则更使人不知这“民愤”是从何而来，是否作过调查，根据又何在。究系什么“民”的“愤”，那是只有杨先生自己知道！
      “文人的笔杆天然是反现状的……。”我看，这未必尽然。远古的不说，就说清朝时的曾国藩、李鸿章吧，他们就不仅没有反当时清朝的“现状”，而且还加以巩固维护。解放前的胡适也是如此，他现在还在依附和维护蒋介石的“现状”，反对人民中国的现状。当然，在旧社会，是一个少数人统治剥削多数人的社会，广大“文人”，不仅是被统治的，也是失意、失业的，这当然就要反当时的旧“现状”，确是自古皆然。但是，现在呢，我国已经解放了，做为“文人”的知识分子，不仅成为劳动人民的一员，成为国家的主人，而且在党和政府的关怀和安排下，已经是“各得其所”，在党的“团结、教育、改造”的政策下，已均有所进步，而在社会主义建设的伟大事业中，党更给“文人”指出了无限宽阔的前途。旧社会的那种随时失业、毕业即失业的“文人”境况，已经是一去不复返了。我想，稍有良心的“文人”，只要稍为回顾一下过去，比比现在，看看将来，是一定心有所感的，是一定要说“热爱新社会，永跟共产党”的。而杨先生既不回顾历史，又不看看现实，调查一下广大“文人”的心向，就贸然说是“文人的笔杆天然是反现状的，真正的文人是反现状的，从古以来好文章都是反现状的”，未免武断，也就很难不令人觉得他连新旧社会都不分的了！当然，对人民的“现状”中的缺点、错误和不够合理的地方，是可以也应该提出批评，但这与反对现状是截然不同的。
    最后，我还要声明一下，我是赞成“放”的，我更赞成“百家齐放”，但是我反对只准自己独放，不许别人放。我想，人民日报也会给我们这些“小文人”以“放”的小园地吧！
