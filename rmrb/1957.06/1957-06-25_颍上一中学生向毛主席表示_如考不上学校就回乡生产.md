Students of Yingshang No. 1 Middle School Express to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　We are all the students of Class C, Junior Grade Three, of Yingshang No. 1 Middle School, Anhui Province. Soon we will graduate and engage in the great cause of socialist construction. We feel extremely happy and honored.

　　When we first entered middle school, each of us had various ideals and aspirations: some wanted to be engineers, some wanted to be writers, some wanted to be musicians...

　　When we learned that most junior middle school and elementary school graduates this year would return to their hometowns for production, and only a small portion would continue their studies, we felt that our ideals could not be realized, and many confused thoughts arose. Most students were afraid of failing the entrance exams and being blamed by their families or ridiculed by the masses. Some chaotic phenomena also arose in their studies: students with good grades became proud, thinking they were sure to pass; students with average grades thought they had "hope," so they buried themselves in hard work, studying desperately, without paying attention to exercise; students with poor grades were worried and pessimistic all day long, thinking that they would not pass the entrance exams anyway, and that algebra, geometry, literature, and Chinese were not needed for participating in production, so they held the idea of living one day at a time, and their academic performance quickly declined.

　　After the school leaders discovered this situation, the principal made a special report, and class meetings were held in separate classes for group discussions. Thanks to the enthusiastic education of the Party and the Youth League, and the repeated instructions of the teachers, our thinking has initially changed. In particular, after studying the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," we clarified the purpose of secondary education and realized that returning to our hometown for production and continuing our studies both have bright and promising futures. More importantly, we realized that the needs of the country are our aspirations, and the future of the country is our ideal. At a class meeting with the theme of "Preparing to be the first generation of cultured new-style farmers in the motherland," the students spoke enthusiastically, expressing their determination to obey the allocation of the motherland. For example, Wang Lezhi said: "I realize that my previous simple idea of continuing my studies was wrong, and I realize that participating in agricultural production is promising. Facts have proved that the countryside needs young people like us with cultural and scientific knowledge. Last Sunday, when I went home, I saw that the accounts kept by my cousin (the production team's accountant) looked like earthworms looking for their mothers, crooked and winding. My cousin also hopes that I can go back after graduation. If I fail the entrance exams after graduation, I will return home without hesitation to take over my cousin's accounting work." Hui student Ban Chaofan said: "I never dreamed that I, a poor child who used to sell fried dough sticks, could actually attend middle school. In addition to enjoying the People's Scholarship and subsidies at school, there are also Hui subsidies, and the state solves my living expenses every semester. I must not forget my roots. I guarantee to Chairman Mao: I will listen to the Party's words from now on, obey the allocation of the motherland, go wherever the motherland tells me to go, and do whatever the motherland tells me to do. I will never care about personal gains or losses. If I pass the entrance exams after graduation, I will continue my studies; if I fail the entrance exams, I will happily return to my hometown for production and learn production techniques from the old farmers."

　　In short, all the students in our class, whether their grades are good or bad, are seizing every opportunity to actively learn their lessons and review the old lessons so that they can firmly and systematically master scientific knowledge and prepare for future further education and employment.

　　Respected Chairman Mao, we want to be the first generation of cultured new-style farmers in the motherland, to be your excellent children, to be good young people of the Party, and to be ready to dedicate our youth to building a new countryside in the motherland. We will never let you down.

　　Respected Chairman Mao, we will write to you again when we have made achievements in production in our hometowns.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Respectfully, All students of Class C, Junior Grade Three, Yingshang No. 1 Middle School, Anhui Province

### 颍上一中学生向毛主席表示  如考不上学校就回乡生产

　　颍上一中学生向毛主席表示
    如考不上学校就回乡生产敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是安徽省颍上一中初三丙班全体同学，不久我们就要毕业了，去从事伟大的社会主义建设事业。我们感到万分的高兴和光荣。
    我们一踏入中学的时候，每人都怀着各种各样的理想和志愿：有的将来要做工程师，有的要做文学家，有的要做音乐家……。
    当我们知道今年初中、高小毕业生大部分要回乡生产，只有一小部分继续升学的时候，就觉得理想不能实现了，产生了许多混乱思想。大多数同学怕考不取学校家庭埋怨，群众讽刺，在学习上也产生了一些混乱现象：成绩好的自以为有把握，骄傲起来；成绩中等的，以为有“奔头”，就埋头苦干，拼命地学习，不注意锻炼；成绩差的整天愁眉苦脸，悲观失望，认为反正考不取学校，参加生产也用不着什么代数、几何、文学、汉语，抱着过一天少一天的思想，学习成绩很快下降。
    学校领导方面发现这种情况后，校长作了专门的报告，又分班举行了班会，分组进行讨论。由于党、团热心的教育，老师一再的指示，我们的思想已初步有了转变，特别是学习了人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，使我们明确了中学教育的目的，认识到回乡生产和继续升学都有光明远大的前途，更重要的使我们认识到国家的需要就是我们的志愿，国家的前途就是我们的理想。在一个“准备做祖国第一代有文化的新式农民”的班会上，同学们都热烈发言，表示了愿意服从祖国分配的决心。例如王乐芝说：“我认识到我以前单纯的升学观点是错误的，认识到参加农业生产是有前途的。事实证明，农村是需要我们这样具备有文化科学知识的青年。上星期天我回家，看见表叔（生产队的会计）上的账就像蚯蚓找它娘似的，弯弯曲曲。我表叔也希望我毕业后能回去。如果我毕业后考不取学校，就毫不犹豫地回到家里，接替表叔的会计工作。”回族同学班超凡说：“我做梦也没有想到我这个南喊北叫的卖油条的穷孩子，居然能上中学。在学校里除享受人民助学金、补助金外，又有回民补助金，每学期的生活费都是国家给我解决。我决不能翻身忘本。我向毛主席保证：我今后要听党的话，服从祖国的分配，祖国叫我到哪里，我就到哪里，祖国叫我做什么，我就做什么，决不计较个人的得失，毕业后考取学校就继续深造，考不取学校就愉快地回乡生产，向老农民学习生产技术。”
    总之，我们全班同学不论成绩好的、坏的，都在抓紧一切可以利用的时间，积极地学好功课，复习旧课，使自己牢固地、系统地掌握科学知识，为将来升学、就业做好准备。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们要做祖国第一代有文化的新式农民，做您的优秀儿女，要做党的好青年，准备把自己的青春献给建设祖国的新农村，我们决不辜负您对我们的希望。
    敬爱的毛主席，等我们回乡生产做出成绩来，再写信告诉您。
                  安徽省颍上一中初三丙班全体同学敬上
