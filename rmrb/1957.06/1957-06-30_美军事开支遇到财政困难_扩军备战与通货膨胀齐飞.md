Xinhua News Agency, June 29th Dispatch from Washington: According to American newspapers, the US government is now spending large amounts of money to develop new weapons such as missiles and nuclear weapons, while also maintaining a huge armed force, and this is encountering serious financial difficulties.

Washington officials have recently become increasingly concerned about domestic inflation, as rising prices have disrupted the government's original spending plans. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that US Assistant Secretary of Defense McNeil revealed to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that the US military expenditure was originally budgeted at 36 billion US dollars for the 1957 fiscal year, but in the past two or three months, this expenditure has actually reached the equivalent of 42 billion US dollars per year. It is estimated that the total military expenditure for the entire fiscal year will increase to 38.5 billion US dollars, 2.5 billion US dollars more than the original plan.

Another financial difficulty encountered by the US government is that the heavy tax burden and inflation brought about by the huge budget have aroused widespread and strong dissatisfaction among the American public. Because next year is a congressional election year, many congressmen have seen the mood of the voters and are demanding to reduce government spending and implement "economy." The Senate Finance Committee has recently begun investigating the government's huge expenditures, and the House of Representatives has also passed a resolution to cut the government's military expenditure for the 1958 fiscal year by 2.5 billion US dollars. In this situation, Defense Secretary Wilson has recently had to issue instructions to the three armed forces, requiring them to cancel some military procurement plans unless Congress provides sufficient funding. According to this instruction, the Air Force alone will cancel or postpone the purchase of military equipment and weapons worth 3.5 billion US dollars, including aircraft and missile projects.

The shortage of cash has also prompted the US government to reconsider its spending plans.

　　美军事开支遇到财政困难
    扩军备战与通货膨胀齐飞
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国报刊报道，美国政府现在一方面用大量经费在发展导弹、核武器等新武器，一方面又维持着庞大的武装部队，这样做碰到了严重的财政困难。
    华盛顿的官员们最近对于国内的通货膨胀越来越感到忧虑，因为物价的不断上涨已经打乱了政府原来的开支计划。“华尔街日报”报道，美国助理国防部长麦克尼尔在参议院拨款小组委员会上透露，美国的军事开支在1957财政年度原订是三百六十亿美元，但是在过去两三个月里，这种开支实际上已经达到相当于每年四百二十亿美元，估计这一财政年度的全年军事开支将要增加到三百八十五亿美元，比原订的计划多二十五亿美元。
    美国政府遇到的另一个财政困难是：庞大预算所带来的沉重赋税负担和通货膨胀，已引起美国公众的普遍强烈不满。由于明年是国会选举年，目前许多国会议员看到了选民的情绪，纷纷在要求减少政府开支和实行“节约”。参议院财政委员会最近已经开始对政府的庞大开支进行调查，众议院也已经通过决定，要把政府在1958财政年度的军事开支削减二十五亿美元。在这种情况下，国防部长威尔逊最近已经不得不向三军发出指示，要求它们取消一些军事采购计划，除非国会给予充分的拨款。据这个指示，单单是空军部要取消或者要延期购买的军事装备和武器就有三十五亿美元，其中包括飞机和导弹等等项目。
    现金的短绌也促使美国政府重新考虑它的开支计划。
