The Struggle Against the Rightists
　　Raised the Consciousness of Intellectuals
　　The Political Atmosphere of the Jiusan Society Symposium Changed Significantly
　　(Our Newspaper's Report) The Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society invited Central Committee members in Beijing and members of the Beijing Municipal Branch yesterday afternoon to hold a symposium to continue discussing the issue of helping the Chinese Communist Party rectify its work style. In the speeches of the twenty-four people at the meeting, they unanimously criticized the fallacies of "Party rule" spread by Chu Anping, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, and other right-wing elements' anti-socialist fallacies, and unanimously demanded that they draw a clear line ideologically and politically with these reactionary statements. Many speakers made self-criticisms for not recognizing the reactionary nature and harm of these fallacies a few days ago, and unanimously expressed that they would improve their political sensitivity, distinguish right from wrong on major issues, fight against all anti-socialist statements, and better help the Chinese Communist Party rectify its work style.

　　Some people at the meeting also requested that a meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society be held to discuss Chu Anping's issue. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society who presided over the meeting, said that he accepted this suggestion.
　　Mao Yisheng said he very much supported the criticism of Chu Anping in the newspaper
　　Central Standing Committee member Mao Yisheng said in his speech: He very much supports the newspaper's severe criticism of Chu Anping's fallacies in the past few days. He said that Chu Anping's speech at the United Front Work Department not only had a draft, but also a title. When he distributed the draft to journalists, he also said that the content of the draft could not be changed, and neither could the title. It is said that he had shown the draft to a leader of the China Democratic League beforehand, but none of our Jiusan leaders knew about it. It is not difficult to speculate on his intentions in doing so. At least it can be said that he did not regard us as comrades. Therefore, even if we draw a line with him, he may not object!
　　Many people mentioned how the democratic parties should play a role at present. Wang Junheng believes that the democratic parties should play a role in three aspects at present. That is: to resolutely stand up and fight against anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks; to eliminate all worries and continue to offer opinions in the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything" based on unity to help the Communist Party rectify its work style; and to educate and transform themselves in the rectification campaign.
　　Alternate Central Committee member Li Xiaofang said: Mr. Jian Bozan said: Right-wing elements write speeches with clever methods, just like writing teaching syllabuses in our schools, you write one chapter, I write one chapter. Central Committee member Wang Zhizhi agreed with this analogy, and he also said: They are in the same tune, have a common position, and their purpose is to abolish the leadership of the Party.

　　Li Zuyin said Zhang Bojun's self-criticism was empty and meaningless; Tu Changwang pointed out that the rightists had theory, program and strategy
　　Li Zuyin, a member of the Beijing Municipal Branch, expressed dissatisfaction with Zhang Bojun's "I Made Serious Mistakes Politically" published in the People's Daily on June 14. He said: Zhang Bojun's self-criticism is empty and meaningless in my opinion. He also said: Zhang Bojun is dissatisfied with the status quo and attempts to fish in troubled waters, make a fortune, and further seize more leadership. Some people in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party said that Zhang Bojun is ambitious, which is worth noting.
　　Central Standing Committee member Tu Changwang said in his speech: Only three of us criticized Chu Anping's fallacies at our last enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Committee, while five sympathized with Chu Anping's fallacies, which shows that we have a political cold and are not sensitive. Then, he pointed out that the recent anti-socialist remarks should be viewed in connection with each other. In this way, it can be found that the right-wing elements have "theories," "political strategies," and "political programs," and are implementing a three-part chorus. He said: Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, and Chen Xingui are their theorists. They attempt to replace the proletarian revolutionary theory with the bourgeois theory, and attempt to replace Marxism-Leninism with revisionism. Their political strategy is: only allow bad words, not good words; distort facts or even fabricate facts, and adopt a two-faced approach of one set of words in front of people and another set behind their backs. Their political program is: to abolish the proletarian dictatorship, to make the Communist Party "step down," to set up another political design institute, with each democratic party contracting a number of counties, to develop 10 million members in each democratic party, and to set up upper and lower houses. Tu Changwang believes that by linking these three together, the seriousness of the problem can be seen, and these fallacies are very easy to confuse intellectuals, especially young students. Therefore, this fallacy must be resolutely criticized.
　　Yun Zhen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Branch, proposed that Chu Anping is a member of the Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Jiusan Society. He said that we do not want such a Deputy Director and demand that the Jiusan Society deal with this issue. Yun Zhen also said angrily that Chu Anping has no discipline. He made such a big mistake, and the Jiusan Society notified him to attend two meetings, but he did not come, nor did he express repentance to the organization.
　　This view was also endorsed by some people.
　　Yuan Hanqing reported his conversation with Chu Anping, Chu believes that his mistake was not knowing that there was a limit to knowing everything and saying everything
　　In his speech, Standing Committee member Yuan Hanqing sharply exposed the fact that Chu Anping had not yet realized his mistake. He said: On June 9, I went to him and asked him why he had not consulted with the people of the Jiusan Society before speaking at the United Front Work Department symposium, and criticized him for saying that "the world belongs to the Party" was wrong. He said: "The issue of mistakes will be discussed later." Regarding the question of why he did not consult with the people of the Jiusan Society, he said it was "no time." He also said: Prepare to make a self-criticism. I asked him: How to make a self-criticism. He said: "I didn't know that there was a limit to knowing everything and saying everything." If he had known, he wouldn't have said it. Yuan Hanqing said: For several days, he has felt that his mistake was serious, and after seeing Shi Liang's speech, he felt even more serious. Chu Anping has a deeper relationship with the Democratic League than with the Jiusan. He is a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, but he did not consult with the people of the Jiusan, but consulted with a person in charge of another democratic party outside the Jiusan. He was cooperating with someone else's speech. What was the purpose of consulting with this person? What is his political attempt? He asked the Jiusan Society to convene a meeting of the Central Standing Committee and asked Chu Anping to explain.
　　In his speech, Xu Songming, in addition to criticizing Chu Anping's speech and expressing his desire to draw a line with him, said that we should not regard the mistakes made by individual party members as the fault of the Party, and that the Party and individual party members should not be confused. At the same time, he also criticized the work of the Ministry of Health for not being done well. Most of the leading comrades of the Ministry of Health do not understand the business and do not follow the mass line, which is the root cause of the poor work. Putting politics first and technology second, and technology should be subordinate to political goals is correct, but it does not mean that technology is not needed. The Ministry of Health's neglect of technology has already caused losses in work. For example, the Ministry of Health issued an instruction to relax the conditions for induced abortion. After the instruction was issued, many women requested induced abortion, causing chaos in hospitals everywhere. Why not consult with experts first before issuing it? He hopes that comrades in the medical and health circles should help the Ministry of Health correct this problem during this rectification campaign.
　　Most of the people who spoke at the meeting, such as Tu Changwang, Pei Wenzhong, Yuan Hanqing, Ye Gongshao, Dong Weichuan, and Chen Mingshao, examined the problem of their lack of political sensitivity. Why are so many senior intellectuals so insensitive to these reactionary remarks? Dong Weichuan put forward his views. He believes that this is the poisoning of senior intellectuals by the old bourgeois democratic ideology.
　　Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, pointed out in his final speech: "Although the anti-socialist remarks have been refuted these days, and their conspiracies have been exposed, this adverse current and anti-people evil wind have not been completely corrected." He believes that Chu Anping's fallacy of "the world belongs to the Party" is a complete slander and an attempt to abolish the leadership of the Party and abolish the socialist system.
　　Xu Deheng also said that he would accept the suggestions of some speakers and convene a meeting of the Central Standing Committee to discuss the handling of Chu Anping.
　　(Full text of the speeches will be published separately)
　　Also speaking at the meeting were Jiusan members Zou Bingwen and Cheng Ximeng, Central Standing Committee member Yan Jici, Central Committee member Zhang Xidi, Central Standing Committee members Xue Yu and Lao Junzhan, Beijing Municipal Branch members Guo Zuyuan, Lu Dexin, Zhang Chubao, and Han Shoutang, and Central Committee member Qiao Qiming. Central Standing Committee member Li Jinxi made a written statement.

### 反右派的斗争  提高了知识分子的觉悟  九三学社座谈会的政治空气显著转变

　　反右派的斗争
　　提高了知识分子的觉悟
　　九三学社座谈会的政治空气显著转变
    本报讯　九三学社中央常务委员会昨天下午邀请在京的中央委员和北京市分社的委员举行座谈会，继续讨论帮助中国共产党整风的问题。会上，二十四个人的发言中，一致对九三学社中央委员、宣传部副部长储安平散布的“党天下”的谬论和其他右派分子反社会主义的谬论作了批判，一致要求要和这些反动的言论在思想上政治上划清界限。不少发言的人对自己前几天没有认识这些谬论的反动性和危害性作了自我批评，一致表示要提高政治嗅觉，明辨大的是非，向一切反社会主义的言论作斗争，更好地帮助中国共产党整风。
    会上还有人要求召开九三学社中央常务委员会议，讨论储安平的问题。主持会议的九三学社主席许德珩表示接受这一建议。茅以升说非常拥护报上对储安平的批评
    中央常务委员茅以升在发言中表示：对这几天报上严厉批评储安平的谬论，非常拥护。他说，储安平在统战部的发言，不但有稿子，还有标题。他把稿子分发给新闻记者时，还说稿子内容不能改，而且标题也不能改。据说事前他曾把这稿子给一位民盟领导人看过，但我们九三的领导同志们却无人知道。他这样作的用意何在不难揣测，至少可说明一点，就是他并未把我们看做同志。因此，我们和他划清界限，他也许不致反对吧！
    许多人在发言中，都谈到目前民主党派如何发挥作用的问题。王钧衡认为：民主党派目前要在三方面起作用。即：坚决地站起来向反党、反社会主义言论进行战斗；消除一切顾虑，从团结出发本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神继续提意见，帮助共产党整风；在整风中教育自己，改造自己。
    候补中央委员李孝芳说：翦伯赞先生说：右派分子写发言稿，有巧妙的办法，像我们学校里写教学大纲一样，你写一章，我写一章。中央委员王之相同意这一比喻，他还说：他们是异曲同工，有共同立场，目的是取消党的领导。
　　李祖荫说章伯钧的检讨空空洞洞毫无内容涂长望指出右派有理论有纲领有策略
    北京分社委员李祖荫在发言中对6月14日人民日报发表的章伯钧的“我在政治上犯了严重的错误”的检讨表示不满。他说：章伯钧的检讨我看空空洞洞，毫无内容。他还说：章伯钧不满现状，企图混水摸鱼，捞一把，进一步抓更多的领导权，农工民主党有人说章伯钧野心勃勃，这值得注意。
    中央常务委员涂长望发言中说：我们上次中常会扩大会上，批评储安平谬论的只有三个人，而同情储安平谬论的就有五个，这说明我们在政治上有伤风现象，嗅觉不灵了。接着，他指出，应该把最近反社会主义的言论联系起来看，这样，就可以发现，右派分子有“理论”，有“政治策略”，还有“政治纲领”，正在实行三部大合唱。他说：章伯钧、章乃器、储安平、陈新桂就是他们的理论家，他们企图用资产阶级的理论代替无产阶级的革命理论，企图用修正主义代替马克思列宁主义。他们的政治策略就是：只准讲坏话，不准讲好话；歪曲事实甚至捏造事实，并且采取人前一套背后一套的两面派手法。他们的政治纲领就是：要取消无产阶级专政，要共产党“下台”，要另外成立政治上的设计院，每个民主党派包干若干个县，要各个民主党派发展一千万党员，要设立上、下议院。涂长望认为，要把这三者联系起来，就可以看出问题的严重性，而且这些谬论在知识分子中特别是青年学生中很容易发生迷惑的作用，因此，必须坚决批判这种谬论。
    北京市分社常务委员恽震提出，储安平是九三学社的中央委员和宣传部副部长。他说我们不愿意要这样的副部长，要求九三学社对这问题加以处理。恽震还气愤地说，储安平太没有纪律，他犯了这么大的错误，九三学社两次开会通知他他都不来，也不向组织表示改悔。
    这一意见还得到一些人的赞同。
    袁翰青报告他和储安平的谈话，储认为自己的错误在于不知道知无不言还有个界限
    常务委员袁翰青发言中，尖锐地揭露了储安平还没有认识到自己错误的事实，他说：6月9日我去找他，问他在统战部座谈会上发言以前，为什么没有同九三学社的人商量，并且批评他说的“党天下”是错误的。他说：“错误的问题以后再谈”，对为什么不和九三学社的人商量的问题，他说是“没时间”。他还说：准备检讨。我问他：如何检讨。他说：“不晓得知无不言本身有个界限”，如果晓得的话，就不说了。我当时说，如果这样，你就不用检讨了。袁翰青说：几天以来，一直感到他的错误严重，看到史良的发言，感到更加严重。储安平同九三比同民盟的关系深，他是九三的中央委员，又是宣传部副部长，但他没有找九三的人商量，却找了九三以外的另一个民主党派的负责人商量。他在配合人家讲话。究竟为什么要和这个人商量？他的政治企图是什么？他要求九三学社召开中央常务委员会，要储安平交代。
    徐诵明在发言中，除批判了储安平的发言表示要与他划清界限以外，说到个别党员所犯的错误，我们不要当作是党的过失，党与个别党员不要混淆起来，同时他还批评了卫生部的工作做得不好。卫生部领导同志多半不懂业务，又不走群众路线，这是工作做不好的根源所在。政治第一，技术第二，技术应当服从政治目的，这是正确的，但是并不是不要技术。卫生部忽视技术的结果已造成工作上的损失。比如卫生部曾颁发了一个放宽人工流产条件的指示，指示发出后很多妇女要求人工流产，弄得各地医院混乱得很。为什么不和专家先商量一下再颁发呢？他希望在这次整风中医药卫生界同志应当帮助卫生部改正这个毛病。
    在会上发言的涂长望、裴文中、袁翰青、叶恭绍、董渭川、陈明绍等大多数人都检查了自己政治嗅觉不灵敏的问题。为什么许多高级知识分子对这些反动言论这样嗅觉不灵呢？董渭川提出了他的看法。他认为这是资产阶级的旧民主主义思想给高级知识分子的毒害。
    九三学社主席许德珩最后发言中指出：“这几天对反社会主义的言论虽然有所驳斥，对他们的阴谋有所揭发，但这股逆流和反人民的歪风还未得到彻底纠正”；他认为储安平的“党天下”的谬论是彻底的诬蔑，是企图取消党的领导，取消社会主义制度。
    许德珩还表示接受一些发言人的建议，将召开中央常务委员会讨论对储安平的处理问题。
            （发言全文另外刊出）
    在会上发言的还有九三社员邹秉文、程希孟，中央常务委员严济慈，中央委员张席禔，中央常务委员薛愚、劳君展，北京市分社委员过祖源、鲁德馨、张楚宝、韩寿堂，中央委员乔启明。中央常务委员黎锦熙作了书面发言。
