Xinhua News Agency report: Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Office, recently stated that Egypt will build new industries to move towards self-sufficiency and safeguard economic independence. In his election speech published in the "Republic Daily" on the 16th, he also said that Egypt will complete the construction of the Aswan High Dam within five years, starting in 1958.

Sabri, as a candidate for the National Assembly, addressed voters in the northeastern electoral district of Cairo on the 13th, saying that according to the 1956 estimates, Suez Canal tolls could generate an annual income of 16 million Egyptian pounds. This income is expected to increase, but at the very least, this money can be used each year to build the High Dam. Sabri said, "I am happy to announce that the land thus increased will be distributed to small farmers, not to feudal landlords." After the completion of the High Dam, the cultivated area will be expanded by two million feddans (one feddan equals 6.3 mu).

He also said that Egypt should produce everything that Egypt is capable of producing. Within the next two years, Egypt will produce enough oil to meet the needs of the country.

The Egyptian Ministry of Industry recently announced that a batch of important factories, the likes of which Egypt has never had, are about to begin construction. These factories are part of the national industrial development five-year plan. One of the major projects is a machine tool factory. This factory is expected to be completed in three years, at a value of approximately 80 million Egyptian pounds ($2,296,000), and will be built with the help of Yugoslav experts. Another project is a factory for the production of plywood. The annual output of this factory is 5,000 tons, and it may be doubled in the future. In addition, plans for the production of building materials and medical equipment are also being drafted.

According to a report in the "Republic Daily," the Egyptian government's geological survey team discovered iron ore deposits with very rich reserves in the southeastern part of the Arabian Desert (near the Red Sea).

　　埃及走向自给自足和经济独立
　　阿斯旺高水坝工程将在五年内完成
    一批前所未有的重要工厂即将兴建
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里最近说，埃及将建设新工业，以走向自给自足和保卫经济独立。他发表在16日“共和国报”上的竞选演说中还说，埃及将在自1958年起的五年内，完成建设阿斯旺高水坝的工程。
    萨布里13日以国民议会议员候选人的身份在开罗东北的选区对选民们说，根据1956年的估计，苏伊士运河通行费每年的收入可达一千六百万埃镑。预计这项收入将会增加，但是，至少每年可以用这笔钱来建设高水坝。萨布里说，“我很高兴地宣布，由此而增加的土地将分配给小农，而不是分配给封建地主。”高水坝建成以后，将扩大耕地面积二百万费丹（一费丹合六点三市亩）。
    他还说，埃及应该生产埃及能够生产的一切。在今后两年内，埃及将生产足够的石油来满足国家的需要。
    埃及工业部最近宣布，一批埃及从未有过的重要工厂即将开始建设。这些工厂是国家工业发展五年计划的一部分。其中一项主要工程是一个工作母机制造厂。这个厂预计三年建成，价值约八千万埃镑（二百二十九万六千美元），并且有南斯拉夫专家帮助建设。另一项工程是一座生产夹板的工厂。这个厂每年的产量是五千吨，将来还可能增加一倍。此外，生产建筑材料和医疗器械的计划也在拟订之中。
    另据“共和国报”报道，埃及政府地质考察团在阿拉伯沙漠东南部（红海附近）发现了储藏量很丰富的铁矿。
