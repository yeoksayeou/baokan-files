    Letter to the Editor
    In the last sentence of my work published in the People's Daily on May 12, "I disagree with Zhu Xi's statement," the "Zhu Xi" is a mistake for "Zhu Xi". Please change "Zhu Xi" to "Cheng and Zhu" and change the sentence "I disagree with Zhu Xi's statement" to "I disagree with the statement of Cheng and Zhu."
    Sincerely,
    Ma Yinchu
    May 30

    来函照登
    5月12日人民日报所登的拙著结论最后一句“我不同意朱羲的说法”，“朱羲”是“朱熹”之误，请把“朱羲”二字改为“程、朱”二字，把“我不同意朱羲的说法”一句改为“我不同意程、朱的说法”。此致敬礼　马寅初　5月30日
