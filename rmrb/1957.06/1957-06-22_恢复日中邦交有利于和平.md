　　Restoring Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations is Conducive to Peace
　　Yamaguchi Kikuichirō, Member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, Chairman of the Committee for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations of the Japan-China Friendship Association
    Today, the barbaric idea that a third world war is inevitable still lingers, and it is a sad thing to take action and conduct political activities under the guidance of this erroneous premise. There is nothing more ridiculous than people with such barbaric ideas advocating "world peace." If the atomic weapons currently possessed by the two major camps are put into war, wouldn't most of humanity be wiped out? We shudder at the mere thought of a third world war.
    In this sense, we must resolutely strive to prevent all future wars.
    In this way, there will be lasting world peace in the future. If this is possible, then we can also get rid of the shackles of all treaties concluded in the past based on the idea that war is inevitable. All countries in the world can freely interact and trade freely, and the national borders in the world will also be removed. This cannot but be the ideal of mankind in the world.
    According to the above ideas, it is most unfortunate that the same nation is divided into two, such as East Germany, West Germany, South Korea, North Korea, Beijing and Taiwan, etc. How to solve this big problem can be put aside for the time being, but the problem before us, the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China, must be resolved as soon as possible. As a beginning to solving this problem, in terms of engaging in exchanges and trade with China, Japan should take the lead in quickly and actively responding to Britain's relaxation of the embargo on China.
    Today, Japan, which has restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, should strive to establish the same relationship with the Beijing government as it has with the Soviet Union, needless to say. The Taiwan issue has always been an internal affair of China, and it should be resolved by Beijing and Taiwan with their own conscience. It is by no means something we should interfere in.
    Standing on the position of opposing all future world wars, I will stand up and work hard to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. (Attached photo)

　　恢复日中邦交有利于和平
　　日本自由民主党议员  日中友好协会恢复邦交委员会委员长  山口喜久一郎
    今天仍然残存着这样野蛮的想法，即认为第三次世界大战必不可免，并且在这种错误的前提观念的指导下采取行动、进行政治活动，这是一件可悲的事情。再也没有比具有这种野蛮想法的人们口倡“世界和平”更滑稽的事了。假如把现在两大阵营保有的原子武器投入战争，人类的大部分岂不都要绝灭吗？我们单是想像一下第三次世界大战，也会感到毛骨悚然的。
    在这个意义上，我们必须坚决争取制止今后的一切战争。
    这样，今后会有世界的持久和平，果能如此，那末也就可以摆脱过去基于战争不可避免的想法而缔结的一切条约的束缚，世界上所有的国家都可自由交往，自由贸易，世界上的国境也将撤除了。这不能不是世界人类的理想。
    按上述想法看来，同一民族被分而为二，如东德、西德，南朝鲜、北朝鲜，北京和台湾等等就是最不幸的了。如何解决这个大问题，可以暂且不谈，但我们眼前的问题，同中国恢复邦交的问题，却不能不早日求得解决。作为解决这个问题的开端，在同中国进行交往、贸易方面，日本应该首先起来迅速、积极地响应英国放宽对中国的禁运的做法。
    今天，已同苏联恢复了邦交的日本和北京政府之间，应努力建立和苏联同样的关系，自不待言。台湾的问题，始终是中国内政问题，应由北京和台湾凭着自己的良知加以解决，绝不是我们应当干预其事的。
    我站在反对今后一切世界战争的立场，将挺身为恢复日中邦交而努力。（附图片）
