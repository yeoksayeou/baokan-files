　　Zhang Bojun's Erroneous Ideology Has a Long History
　　Hu Yihe
　　I have been working in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party for several years. In the past few years—especially in the past year or so, in the meetings of the Central Executive Bureau, the symposiums of the Central Committee members, and the temporary heart-to-heart talks, the remarks of Comrade Zhang Bojun that I came into contact with left a deep impression on my mind. Looking back at his past remarks, and looking at his speech on the "Political Design Institute" and other issues at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I believe that his erroneous thinking is not accidental, just as Comrade Yang Qingyuan said at the symposium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, it "has a long history."
　　Zhang Bojun believes that the success of the Chinese revolution was because the United States overestimated the strength of the Democratic League at that time and relaxed its military intervention.
　　Not long ago, Comrade Zhang Bojun said at a symposium of the Central Committee members of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party held at the Political Consultative Conference Cultural Club: I always think that we should not regard capitalism as worthless, nor should we think that defeating Chiang Kai-shek is the power of the Communist Party alone. Marshall once said that China did not "perish" to the Communist Party, but to the China Democratic League. Why did Marshall say that? It was because the China Democratic League gave the United States the illusion that China's third force could take the democratic road of capitalism and would not follow the Soviet Union's example. Because of this illusion, the United States relaxed the replenishment of its military power, and as a result, it was greatly fooled, causing Chiang Kai-shek to collapse quickly.
　　According to Comrade Zhang Bojun's view, the success of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution was determined by the Democratic League giving the United States such an "illusion" at that time, rather than by the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I think this kind of argument is extremely wrong.
　　The origin and development of the "Political Design Institute"
　　"Don't regard capitalism as worthless," Comrade Zhang Bojun has said this more than once in recent years. Last year, when he conveyed Chairman Mao's "Ten Major Policies" to the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, he made such remarks: "Now many people say that capitalism is not good, but in fact, capitalism still has vitality. Why is it still alive? It is because there is a multi-party system, a democratic system, a House of Representatives and a Senate, and a ruling party and an opposition party. Why did Emperor Guangxu fail? It was because there was no democracy. Why hasn't capitalism collapsed yet? It is because there is still democracy. The method of capitalist countries is: if you can't do it, I'll do it; if I can't do it, you'll do it. The ruling party scolds the opposition party, and the opposition party scolds the ruling party, that's vitality. This is called criticism and self-criticism in our country, but in their country it is called 'wah lah wah lah'. Therefore, it can be said that capitalism also has its good points, that is, it has the role of mutual restraint and mutual supervision."
　　Now, seeing this passage (I say seeing this passage because this passage is still recorded in my notebook), and then thinking of Zhang Bojun's repeated talk about establishing a "two-house system" in China and the recently proposed "Political Design Institute," it shows that his mistake is not accidental, but that he has his own set of political propositions.
　　Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the Hungarian incident, Comrade Zhang Bojun has repeatedly said such things as "Socialist democracy still needs to be developed and changed, and it is continuing to change now, the situation will continue to change, and our responsibilities are very heavy."
　　Zhang Bojun's political tactics - one blow and one pull
　　Comrade Shi Liang believes that Comrade Zhang Bojun has two faces, and I think this has hit the nail on the head of Comrade Zhang Bojun's problem. I remember he said at a symposium of the Central Committee members: There are two kinds of politicians in the world, one is an idealistic politician, and the other is a realistic politician. Comrade Zhang Bojun considers himself a realistic politician. But what exactly is a realistic politician? Let's explain it in Comrade Zhang Bojun's own words. Last July, at a symposium of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, he said: After the issue of intellectuals was raised, there was a big change in the situation. In the past, the Communist Party "struck" at intellectuals, but now it is "pulling" them. Why strike first and then pull? This is politics. People who engage in politics don't understand this point, they can't even be Liu Bang, let alone Mao Zedong. Why didn't Chiang Kai-shek succeed? It was because he only knew how to strike and didn't know how to pull.
　　This is Comrade Zhang Bojun's understanding of "politics." Within the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, he often uses this method of "one blow and one pull." Some comrades in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party have deeply experienced this.
　　There are many more erroneous remarks of Comrade Zhang Bojun that can be discussed (in fact, our leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party know even more.) Now that he has formally requested everyone to offer opinions on his mistakes, as a cadre of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, I will first briefly put forward these few points for Comrade Zhang Bojun to use as a reference for his self-examination.

　　章伯钧的错误思想由来已久
　　胡一禾
    我在农工民主党中央委员会工作，已经几年了。几年来——特别最近一年多来，在中央执行局会议、中央委员座谈会及临时进行的谈心会上，所接触到的章伯钧同志的言论，在我脑子里留下深刻的印象。回想起来他在过去的那些言论，再看一看他在中共中央统战部座谈会上关于“政治设计院”等问题的发言，我以为他的错误思想不是偶然的，正如杨清源同志在农工民主党座谈会上所说的，“由来已久”。
    章伯钧认为中国革命成功，是因为当时美国过高估计了民盟的力量，放松了军事干涉
    就在前不久章伯钧同志曾在政协文化俱乐部召开的农工党中央委员座谈会上说：我总以为不要把资本主义看得那末一文不值，也不要以为打败蒋介石就是共产党一党的力量。马歇尔就曾经说过，中国“亡国”不亡于共产党，而是亡于中国民主同盟。马歇尔为什么这么说？就因为中国民主同盟在当时给美国一种错觉：中国的第三种力量可以走资本主义的民主道路，不会步苏联后尘。由于有这种错觉，美国就放松了军事力量的补充，结果上了大当，弄得蒋介石很快垮台。
    照章伯钧同志的这样看法，中国新民主主义革命的成功，是决定于民主同盟在当时给了美国这样一个“错觉”，而不是由于中国共产党领导的正确。这种言论，我以为是极其错误的。
　　“政治设计院”的来龙去脉
    “不要把资本主义看得那末一文不值”，这句话，在近年来章伯钧同志曾说过不止一次。去年，当他在农工党中央委员会上传达毛主席的“十大方针”时，曾发表过这样的言论：“现在许多人都说资本主义不好，事实上资本主义也还有活力。为什么还有活力？就因为有多党制度，有民主制度，有众议院和参议院，有在朝党和在野党。光绪皇帝为什么完蛋？就因为没有民主。资本主义为什么还没有完蛋？就因为还有民主。资本主义国家的办法是：你不行，我来，我不行，你来。在朝的骂在野的，在野的骂在朝的，这就是活力。这在我们叫做批评和自我批评，在他们就叫做‘哇啦哇啦’。所以说，资本主义也有好的地方，也就是说有互相抑制、互相监督的作用”。
    现在看到这段话（我说看到这段话，是因为这段话还记在我的笔记本上），再想到章伯钧所一再谈到的要在中国搞“两院制”以及最近提出的“政治设计院”，说明了他的错误不是偶然的，而是有他的一套政治主张。
    自苏共二十次代表大会以后，特别是匈牙利事件发生后，章伯钧同志曾几次说到“社会主义民主还要发展变化，现在正在继续变化，形势还要变，我们大家的责任很重大”这一类的话。
    章伯钧的政治手法——一打一拉
    史良同志认为章伯钧同志有两面作法，我认为这是打中了章伯钧同志的要害。记得他在中委座谈会上曾说：世界上有两种政治家，一种是理想主义的政治家，一种是现实主义的政治家。章伯钧同志是以现实主义的政治家自命的。但究竟什么是现实主义的政治家？还是以章伯钧同志自己的话来说明。去年7月，在农工党中央的一个座谈会上，他曾说：知识分子问题提出后，情况有了大变化。共产党过去对知识分子是“打”，现在是“拉”。为什么先打后拉？这就是政治。搞政治的人不懂得这一点，连做汉高祖都不行，更不必说做毛泽东。蒋介石为什么不行？就因为他只会打，不会拉。
    这就是章伯钧同志对于“政治”的理解。在农工民主党内部，他就常常用这种“一打一拉”的办法。关于这一点，农工民主党中央有些同志是深有所体会的。
    关于章伯钧同志的这些错误言论，还可以谈得很多，（其实，我们农工民主党的中央负责同志们知道得更多。）现在他已正式提出要求大家对他的错误提意见，作为农工民主党的一个干部，我就先简略地提出这几点供章伯钧同志作为他自我检查的参考。
