Strive for a Bumper Harvest with All Our Might
　　Rectification Campaigns in Guizhou's Counties, Districts, and Townships Postponed Until After the Autumn Harvest

　　(Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 10th) The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of prefectural party secretaries from June 3rd to 4th to discuss the issue of simultaneously managing rectification and work. The meeting believed that as long as a bumper harvest is achieved this year, many of the existing contradictions in rural areas will be easier to resolve.

　　Currently, many shortcomings in the work and ideology of party organizations and members at all levels in Guizhou Province are detrimental to achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture. The broad masses of party members and non-party members hope that party organizations at all levels can quickly enter the rectification phase. However, if all party members are concentrated on rectification, agricultural production will inevitably be left without leadership. Therefore, the meeting began by discussing this issue.

　　After discussion, the meeting proposed the following steps for rectification: The rectification at the prefectural and autonomous prefecture levels can be coordinated with the provincial-level rectification, but the document study phase should not be centralized; instead, documents should be taken to the countryside. Rectification in counties, districts, and townships should be postponed until after the autumn harvest, with all efforts currently focused on production.

　　The meeting studied and analyzed many criticisms and opinions put forward by people inside and outside the party and the broad masses of people before and after the start of the rectification movement. It was believed that, in conjunction with the central government's rectification instructions, the following points should be implemented in the spirit of rectification before the formal rectification in counties, districts, and townships. First, the decision to have cadres participate in productive labor must be adhered to. Since the central government issued the rectification instructions, cadres at all levels in Guizhou Province have actively participated in productive labor, which has greatly improved the relationship between leading organs, cadres, and workers and peasants. The meeting emphasized that this measure must be adhered to and implemented. Second, mobilize family members who are able and have the conditions to participate in production to return to their hometowns for production. In this work, leaders at all levels are required to take the lead in mobilizing their families to return to their hometowns, just as they participate in productive labor. Third, prioritize the errors and shortcomings that have been discovered, and resolve those that can be resolved resolutely and quickly. For example, the privileged thinking and special treatment of some party members should be corrected. Party organizations and members with a serious style of detachment from the masses should be helped to conduct self-examination and rapidly improve.

　　Recently, due to numerous rural disasters (drought, hail, infectious diseases), mass superstitious activities have been observed in many places, and in some places, they have even hindered production. Some grassroots cadres have shown impatience in dealing with this issue, which not only failed to make the masses accept correct opinions but also made them dissatisfied with the cadres. In the discussion of this issue, prefectural party secretaries used facts to illustrate that this is because the masses want to get rid of the suffering caused by disasters, but we currently do not have the power to eliminate various disasters, and therefore this superstitious phenomenon arises. Therefore, to eliminate the masses' superstitious thinking, we must not be impatient. Even if these mass superstitious activities hinder production, we must patiently educate the masses and explain the reasons to them; a rude attitude is not only wrong but also ineffective. The meeting believed that cadres at all levels now have some understanding of contradictions among the people in general, but lack methods. Therefore, it is necessary to help grassroots cadres summarize their work and learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

　　The meeting also made arrangements for current rural work. The meeting believed that in order to further mobilize the production enthusiasm of farmers and strive for a bumper harvest this year, the current small-season pre-distribution work must be done well. On the one hand, agricultural cooperatives should be urged to quickly sort out their accounts and publicize them to their members. On the other hand, cadres who have been transferred to work in agricultural cooperatives should be mobilized to concentrate their efforts on helping agricultural cooperatives to clear their accounts.

### 以全部力量争取农业大丰收  贵州各县、区、乡整风推迟到秋收后进行

　　以全部力量争取农业大丰收
　　贵州各县、区、乡整风推迟到秋收后进行
    本报贵阳10日电  中共贵州省委在6月3日到4日召开了地委书记会议，讨论整风和工作两不误的问题。会议认为，只要争取到今年农业的大丰收，农村目前存在的许多矛盾都比较容易解决。
    目前，贵州省各级党组织和党员在工作和思想方面的许多缺点，是对争取农业大丰收不利的。广大党员和党外人士都希望各级党组织能迅速进入整风。但是如果所有的党员都集中进行整风，农业生产就势必处于无人领导的状态。因此，会议一开始就讨论了这个问题。
    经过讨论，会议提出了整风步骤：专区、自治州一级的整风，可以与省级整风相衔接，但学习文件阶段不要集中，要带文件下乡。县、区、乡的整风推迟到秋收以后，目前以全部力量抓生产。
    会议研究和分析了党内、党外人士和广大人民群众在整风运动开始前后提出的许多批评和意见，认为结合中央整风指示，在县、区、乡正式整风以前，应以整风精神贯彻执行以下几点。一，必须坚持实行干部参加劳动生产的决定。自从中央发布整风指示以来，贵州省各级干部都积极参加了劳动生产，这使领导机关、干部与工、农群众之间的关系有了很大改善。会议强调必须把这项措施坚持贯彻下去。二，动员能够参加生产，有条件参加生产的家属回乡生产。在这项工作中，要求各级领导干部像参加劳动生产一样，带头动员家属回乡。三，把已经发现的错误和缺点排一排队，能解决的要坚决、迅速解决。如某些党员的特权思想和特殊待遇要纠正。对一些有严重脱离群众作风的党组织和党员，要帮助他们进行检查，迅速改进。
    最近由于农村灾害（旱、冰雹、传染病）较多，许多地方发现群众性的迷信活动，有些地方甚至因而妨碍了生产。有些基层干部在处理这个问题时，表现出急躁情绪，结果不但不能使群众接受正确的意见，反而使群众对干部不满。在讨论这个问题中，各地委书记都用事实说明，这是群众想摆脱灾害的疾苦，而我们目前又没力量消灭各种灾害，因而才会有这种迷信现象。因此，要消除群众的迷信思想，不能操之过急，即使这些群众性迷信活动妨碍了生产，也要耐心地向群众进行教育，要向群众说明道理；粗暴的态度不仅是错误的也是无效的。会议认为，现在各级干部对人民内部矛盾一般的已有了一些认识，只是缺少办法，因此要帮助基层干部总结工作，学会正确处理人民内部矛盾。
    会议对目前农村工作也进行了安排。会议认为要进一步发动农民的生产积极性，争取今年农业大丰收，首先就要作好目前的小季预分工作。一方面要督促农业社赶快整理账目，向社员公布。另一方面要动员下调到农业社工作的干部集中力量帮助农业合作社清理账目。
