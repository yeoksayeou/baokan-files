　　“Embargo” Loopholes Widen
　　West Germany and Italy Follow Britain's Example
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 19th: According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report from Bonn: The West German government decided on the 18th to relax trade embargo restrictions on China. Two hundred items have been removed from the embargo list of four hundred items, including automobiles, tires, and certain types of machinery. Many other items, such as armaments and fissionable materials, are not included in the relaxation.
    Like Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, this measure merely modifies the particularly harsh embargo regulations against China, making them the same as the embargo restrictions against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Europe.
    Officials in Washington said that the West German government had consulted with the U.S. government several times before deciding to take this measure.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Rome Dispatch: The Italian news agency reported today that the Italian government is preparing to lift the trade "embargo" against China, and the government has notified the "China Committee" of the "Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls" of this intention.
    "Unità" published a commentary on this matter. It said that this may be the first step towards resolving many business issues related to relations between the two countries. The newspaper said that Italian traders had recently gathered in Milan to advocate increased trade relations with China.

　　“禁运”缺口越来越大
　　西德意大利也效法英国
    新华社柏林19日电　据德意志新闻社波恩消息：西德政府在18日决定放宽对中国的贸易禁运限制。在禁运单上的四百项中去掉了二百项，其中有汽车、轮胎和某些类型的机器。另外有许多东西，例如军火、裂变物质之类不在放宽之列。
    同英国、荷兰、比利时等国家一样，这一个措施只是把原来对中国的特别苛刻的禁运规定作了修改，改为同对苏联和欧洲其他社会主义国家的禁运限制一样。
    华盛顿的官员说，西德政府在决定采取这一措施前曾经几次和美国政府磋商。
    新华社18日讯　罗马消息：意大利通讯社今天报道说，意大利政府正在准备取消对中国的贸易“禁运”，政府已经把这一打算通知“巴黎统筹委员会”中的“中国委员会”。
    “团结报”就这件事情发表了评论。它说，这可能是走向解决同两国关系有关的许多商务问题的第一步。报纸说，意大利贸易商最近曾在米兰集会，主张增进同中国的贸易关系。
