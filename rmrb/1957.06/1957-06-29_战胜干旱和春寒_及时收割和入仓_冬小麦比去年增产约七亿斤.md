Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The majority of the nation's over 370 million mu of winter wheat has been harvested, and is now in the threshing and storage stages. The remaining small portion will be ready for harvest in about half a month. The total yield is estimated to be about 700 million jin higher than in 1956.

According to estimates from major wheat-producing provinces, Anhui Province will produce more than 1.6 billion jin more than in the disaster-stricken year of 1956, approaching the level of the bumper harvest in 1955. Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces also saw increased production. However, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces experienced varying degrees of reduced production compared to 1956, either due to a smaller planting area or a decrease in yield per unit area.

This year, the nation's winter wheat planting area increased by more than 5.8 million mu compared to last year. From a natural conditions perspective, the main wheat-producing areas experienced drought in the autumn and winter of last year, and then encountered spring cold this year. The maturity period of winter wheat was generally delayed by ten days to half a month, which had a certain impact on the yield. In many places, field management of winter wheat was relatively lax in the early stages, not as good as last year, but improved in the later stages. Especially during the harvest period, agricultural cooperatives in various places mostly learned from last year's lessons, and preparation work was better than last year. Various places also organized large numbers of cadres and local troops to go to the countryside to help agricultural cooperatives with harvesting. Therefore, this year's wheat harvest work proceeded relatively smoothly and carefully, and losses during harvesting were also relatively light.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th: The wheat in the Yellow River irrigation area of Henan Province has had another bumper harvest this year. This is the fifth bumper year since the opening of the irrigation area.

The Yellow River irrigation area of Henan Province is located in the old course and flooded area of the Yellow River, including the six counties of Yuanyang, Yanjin, Wuzhi, Huojia, Xinxiang, and Ji County. In the past, the yield of wheat per mu here was always seventy or eighty jin. Since the completion of the Yellow River irrigation canal in 1952, coupled with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the yield has gradually increased. Last year, the wheat yield per mu reached an unprecedented peak, more than doubling the previous seventy or eighty jin. Although there was a drought this year, irrigation was timely, and the average yield of 640,000 mu of wheat was 159 jin per mu, still reaching last year's level.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th: During the wheat harvesting season in the Jinnan Plain of Shanxi, good news of high yields is constantly coming from the wheat threshing grounds piled high with wheat stacks.

The Linfen County Red Star Agricultural Cooperative, which won the title of National Wheat High-Yield Model Cooperative last year, has achieved another overall bumper harvest this year. According to news that reached Taiyuan City on the 26th, the average yield of more than 3,900 mu of wheat in the entire cooperative was 332 jin per mu, an increase of 42 jin compared to last year. Among them, 105 mu of irrigated land yielded 1,030 jin per mu, setting a new record for large-scale high yield in the province.

According to current understanding, the Meisu Agricultural Cooperative in Linyi County is the unit with the highest wheat yield in the province. Three mu and four fen of irrigated land yielded an average of more than 1,300 jin per mu. The Fenglingdu "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Yongji County set a record for high yield of dryland wheat, with one mu of high-yield dryland wheat producing 1,016 jin.

　　战胜干旱和春寒　及时收割和入仓
    冬小麦比去年增产约七亿斤
    新华社28日讯　今年全国三亿七千多万亩冬小麦，绝大部分已经收割完毕，转入打场、入仓，小部分再有半个月左右，也可以收割完毕。总产量预计比1956年增加约七亿斤。
    根据各产麦省份的预计，安徽省比遭灾严重的1956年增产十六亿多斤，接近1955年丰收的水平；江苏、湖北、四川、贵州等省也是增产的。而河南、山东、河北、陕西、山西等省或因种植面积缩小，或因单位面积产量下降，产量都比1956年有不同程度的减少。
    今年全国冬小麦比去年扩大五百八十多万亩。从自然条件方面来看，主要产麦区去年秋、冬干旱，今年又遇春寒，冬小麦的成熟期一般推迟了十天到半个月，产量受到一定的影响。许多地方对冬小麦的田间管理工作，在初期比较放松，不如去年，后期有所改进。特别是在收获期间，各地农业社大多接受了去年的教训，准备工作比去年好。各地还组织了大批干部和当地驻军下乡，帮助农业社收割。因此，今年的麦收工作进行得比较顺利和细致，收割中的损失也比较轻。
    据新华社郑州28日电　河南省引黄灌溉区的小麦，今年又逢丰收。这是灌溉区开辟以来的第五个丰收年了。
    河南省引黄灌溉区是黄河故道和泛滥区，包括原阳、延津、武陟、获嘉、新乡、汲县六个县。过去，这里小麦每亩产量一直是七、八十斤。从1952年引黄灌溉渠道修成，再加上农业合作化运动的开展，产量便逐渐提高。去年小麦每亩产量达到空前的高峰，比过去七、八十斤提高了一倍多。今年虽然遇到干旱，但是灌溉适时，六十四万亩小麦平均每亩产一百五十九斤，仍然达到去年的水平。
    据新华社太原28日电　山西晋南平原收打小麦的季节里，从麦垛累累的打麦场上，不断地传出高额丰产的喜讯。
    去年荣获全国小麦丰产模范社称号的临汾县红星农业社，今年小麦又获得全面丰收。据26日传到太原市的消息说，全社三千九百多亩小麦每亩平均收到三百三十二斤，比去年增产四十二斤。其中一百零五亩水地，每亩产一千零三十斤，创造全省大面积丰产新纪录。
    据目前了解，临猗县嵋涑农业社是全省小麦产量最高的单位。三亩四分水浇地，平均每亩收到一千三百多斤。创造旱地小麦高产纪录的是永济县风陵渡“五一”农业社，有一亩高额丰产旱地小麦，产到了一千零一十六斤。
