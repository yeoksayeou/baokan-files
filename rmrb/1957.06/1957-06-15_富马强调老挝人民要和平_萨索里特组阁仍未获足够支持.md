Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 14th: Vientiane Dispatch: Former Lao Prime Minister Phouma, who has already resigned, said on June 13th that his government sought a solution to the issue of the Lao Fighting Units in order to spare the country the scourge of civil war. He pointed out that if a civil war had occurred at that time, its consequences could have been fatal for the entire country of Laos. When referring to the government's past negotiations with the Lao representatives, Phouma said that he had done everything possible to reach a "final reconciliation" among various figures in Lao society.

The resigning-but-staying Lao Prime Minister made these remarks while issuing orders to the armed forces in his capacity as concurrently serving Minister of National Defense. He also said, "The military knows better than anyone that people must desire the benefits of peace rather than the destruction and suffering of war. I believe that great progress has been made in trying to achieve peace on the basis of national unity, independence, and freedom."

Meanwhile, National Party Chairman Kou Voravong, who was tasked with forming a cabinet, has not yet been able to obtain sufficient support. Independent Party Chairman Sananikone wrote to Kou Voravong, demanding that the Independent Party be given a Deputy Prime Minister and ministerial positions equal in number to half of the ministerial seats obtained by the National Party.

Other reports say that five cabinet members of the Phouma government, including Phouma, will not participate in the new cabinet. Lao United Party Chairman Prince Souphanouvong has also refused to support Kou Voravong in forming a cabinet. The United Party's "New Laos" newspaper recently criticized Kou Voravong for opposing Lao unification and following a neutral path.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 14th: Vientiane Dispatch: According to the "New Laos" newspaper, Kou Voravong, who was recently ordered to form a cabinet, recently "said at a meeting of his party (the National Party) that he had ordered the police to monitor Prince Souphanouvong and the delegation of the Lao Fighting Units, preventing them from contacting friends and outsiders."

Prince Souphanouvong is currently in Vientiane. He is there to negotiate with the Lao Royal Government to resolve the issue of peaceful unification.

　　富马强调老挝人民要和平
　　萨索里特组阁仍未获足够支持
    新华社河内14日电　万象消息：已经辞职的老挝首相富马6月13日说，他的政府所以在寮国战斗部队问题上力求达到一个解决办法，是想使国家免于内战的祸害。他指出，如果当时发生内战，它的后果对于老挝全国说来可能是致命的。富马在提到政府过去同寮国代表之间的谈判时说，他曾经尽一切力量使老挝社会中的各种人物之间能够达成“最后的和解”。
    这位辞职留任中的老挝首相是在以兼任国防大臣的身份向武装部队发布命令的时候说了这番话。他又说，“军人比谁都更清楚地知道，人们必定是愿意要和平的好处而不要战争的破坏和苦难。我相信，在设法在国家团结、独立和自由的基础上实现和平方面，已经取得了很大的进展。”
    同时，受命组阁的国家党主席卡代·萨索里特还没有能够得到足够的支持。独立党主席萨纳尼空写信给萨索里特，要求给予独立党一个副首相和数目相等于国家党所得部长席位的一半的部长职位。
    还有消息说，包括富马在内的富马政府的五个阁员将不参加新内阁。老挝联合党主席彭·苏发那冯也拒绝支持萨索里特组阁。联合党的“新老挝报”最近曾经抨击萨索里特反对老挝统一和走中立的道路。
    据新华社河内14日电　万象消息：据“新老挝报”报道，最近奉命组阁的卡代·萨索里特最近“在他的党（国家党）的某次会议上说，他已经命令警察监视苏发努冯亲王和寮国战斗部队代表团，不让他们同朋友和外人来往”。
    苏发努冯亲王现在正在万象。他是来和老挝王国政府谈判解决和平统一问题的。
