　　The Sovereignty of Tunisia Should Be Respected
　　Yuan Xianlu
    In Tunisia, from the ports bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the villages near the Sahara, the call for the withdrawal of French troops is resounding everywhere.
    Tunisia has been independent for over a year. However, even now, there are still 45,000 French troops stationed in this country. These troops, as Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba said, "act as if they are in a conquered territory, and act according to this idea." On July 18 last year, they arrested about a hundred peaceful residents in M'dhilla, the mining center in southwestern Tunisia; on October 17, they dropped incendiary bombs on the Tunisian village of Chemaim; on November 28, they opened fire on local residents in Djebel-Dra, Tunisia, with the cooperation of seven military aircraft... The above are just a few examples.
    The Tunisian people, who had to fight for a long time to force the French colonialists to recognize Tunisia's independence, certainly cannot tolerate the continued presence of French colonial troops on their territory and their rampant behavior. The Tunisian government has repeatedly asked France to withdraw its troops, but the French government has always adopted a delaying attitude.
    Recently, the French colonial troops in Tunisia have become even more rampant. On May 31, they suddenly launched an attack on the Tunisian National Guard in a village in Tunisia near the Algerian border. Three Tunisian soldiers were killed, and Tunisian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Hajjeli, who was inspecting Algerian refugee camps in the area, was also seriously injured. Because of this, the Tunisian government once again asked France to hold negotiations on the issue of troop withdrawal and announced a ban on the arbitrary movement of French troops within Tunisia. France completely disregarded Tunisian sovereignty, and consequently, in June, French colonial troops had several large-scale armed conflicts with Tunisian troops.
    On what grounds do French troops continue to remain in Tunisia? It is said that the situation in Algeria requires France to do so. What situation exists in Algeria? Everyone knows that France is carrying out brutal suppression of the national independence movement there. The Tunisian people cherish their national independence and also care about the struggle of their Arab brothers in Algeria. How can they allow their territory to be used as a military stronghold by the colonialists who are slaughtering their brothers?
    However, the rulers of France insist on Tunisia accepting this humiliating position. To achieve this, France has continuously exerted pressure on the Tunisian government, including stopping the "financial assistance" promised to Tunisia according to the agreement, saying that Tunisia's support for the national aspirations of the Algerian people is an interference in France's internal affairs.
    France's rogue tactics have not made Tunisia yield. Prime Minister Bourguiba has stated that France's decision violates the Franco-Tunisian economic agreement, and Tunisia will take all necessary steps to defend its economic independence and reconsider the provisions in this agreement regarding keeping Tunisia in the franc zone and establishing a customs union with France. He declared that Tunisia's attitude towards Algeria is "forever unchanged."
    This time, the Tunisian government has resolutely demanded that France hold negotiations with Tunisia on the withdrawal of French troops immediately after the formation of the new government. Prime Minister Bourguiba also warned France: "If France delays again on this issue, we will change our attitude, which will be detrimental to French interests in this country."
    The newly appointed French Prime Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury has not yet responded to the Tunisian government's demands. However, every sober-minded Frenchman can see that for France, it is the best way to negotiate with Tunisia as soon as possible and withdraw the French troops still remaining in Tunisia, which is in line with Franco-Tunisian friendly relations and also in line with the national interests of France.

### 突尼斯的主权应当得到尊重

　　突尼斯的主权应当得到尊重
　　袁先禄
    在突尼斯，从濒临地中海的港口到靠近撒哈拉的村落，到处都激荡着要求法国军队撤退的呼声。
    突尼斯独立已经一年多了。但是，直到现在，在这个国家里还驻着四万五千名法国军队。这些军队，正如突尼斯首相布尔吉巴所说的那样，“俨然以为自己是在一个被征服的地区里，而且按着这种想法来行动”。去年7月18日，它们在突尼斯西南部的矿区中心牧拉雷斯达逮捕了一百个左右的和平居民；10月17日，它们用飞机向突尼斯的谢马姆村投掷燃烧弹；11月28日，它们在突尼斯的杰别里—德拉新地方由七架军用飞机配合向当地居民开火……。以上不过是几个例子而已。
    经过长期斗争才迫使法国殖民者承认突尼斯独立的突尼斯人民，当然不能容忍法国殖民军队继续留在他们国土上并且这样横行霸道。突尼斯政府曾经多次要求法国把军队撤出去，但是法国政府却一直采取了拖延的态度。
    最近，在突尼斯的法国殖民军队还更加猖狂起来。5月31日，它们在突尼斯境内靠近阿尔及利亚边境的一个村子向突尼斯国民警卫队突然发动了一次袭击。三个突尼斯士兵牺牲了，正在当地视察阿尔及利亚难民营的突尼斯外交部秘书长哈杰利也受了重伤。为这事突尼斯政府再次要求法国就撤退军队的问题举行谈判，并且宣布禁止法国军队在突尼斯境内任意调动。法国却完全蔑视突尼斯的主权，因而在6月份法国殖民军又连续和突尼斯军队发生了几次大规模的武装冲突。
    法国军队凭什么理由继续留在突尼斯呢？据说，阿尔及利亚的局势需要法国这样做。在阿尔及利亚存在什么局势呢？谁都知道是法国在那里对民族独立运动进行着残暴的镇压。突尼斯人民珍视自己的民族独立，也关怀他们在阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯兄弟的斗争，怎能允许自己的领土被屠杀他们兄弟的殖民者当成军事据点？
    但是，法国的统治者却硬要突尼斯接受这种屈辱的地位。为了做到这一点，法国不断向突尼斯政府施加压力，包括停止按协定答应给突尼斯的“财政援助”，说什么突尼斯对阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的支持是干涉法国内政。
    法国这种无赖手段并没有使突尼斯屈服。布尔吉巴首相已经表示，法国的决定违反了法突经济协定，突尼斯将采取一切必要步骤来保卫自己的经济独立，并且对这个协定中关于使突尼斯留在法郎区以及同法国建立关税同盟的规定重新进行考虑。他声明，突尼斯对阿尔及利亚的态度是“永远不变”的。
    这一次，突尼斯政府又坚决地要求法国在新政府成立后马上同突尼斯举行撤退法国军队的谈判。布尔吉巴首相还警告法国说：“如果法国在这个问题上进行新的拖延，我们将改变我们的态度，从而不利于法国在这个国家的利益。”
    刚刚上台的法国新总理布歇—莫努里对突尼斯政府的要求还没有作出答复。但是，每一个清醒的法国人都看得到，对法国来说，尽速同突尼斯进行谈判，撤退仍留在突尼斯的法军，是符合法突友好关系也符合法国民族利益的最好办法。
