    Hunan Opposes Two Deviations in Rural Work
    Burying oneself in production without solving pressing problems, and engaging in empty talk about democracy in running cooperatives while relaxing leadership over production, are both incorrect. The Provincial Party Committee demands a swift reversal of these deviations and strives for a bumper harvest.
    (Our Dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries on May 27th, criticizing two deviations that have recently occurred in rural work in various localities: one is engaging in empty talk about democracy in running cooperatives, divorced from current production; the other is burying oneself in production, knowingly aware of major problems hindering production, yet failing to resolve them.
    These two deviations were discovered by several secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee during their recent deep dives into agricultural cooperatives.
    On May 9th, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on further implementing democratic cooperative management to strive for a great agricultural harvest, emphasizing that democratic cooperative management and current production are entirely consistent and must be closely integrated. However, some localities did not fully grasp this spirit and continued to conduct them in isolation in their actual work. The Yiyang County Party Committee, fearing that democratic cooperative management would cause chaos and affect current production, did not sufficiently emphasize this issue at two cadre meetings, with the result that some townships and cooperatives did not even mention the four words "democratic cooperative management." Pressing problems requiring resolution within the cooperatives were not addressed, and the enthusiasm of the members was low. Conversely, in a small number of agricultural cooperatives in Changsha, Ningxiang, and other counties, disregarding the busy farming season, they mechanically copied the "Hundred Schools of Thought" approach from large cities, endlessly mobilizing members to find contradictions, holding meetings day and night, which not only affected production but also failed to address the main problems genuinely hindering current production, and created new contradictions within the cooperatives. The Provincial Party Committee criticized the style of burying oneself in production without solving problems as subjectivism. Because even if one subjectively wants to improve production, it will not be achieved if pressing problems are not resolved. The style of engaging in empty talk about contradictions, pursuing democracy for the sake of democracy, and relaxing leadership over production is dogmatism that mechanically copies without regard to actual circumstances, which is even more detrimental to production.
    The Provincial Party Committee demands that all localities swiftly reverse the above two deviations, seize the precious opportunity of June and July, earnestly carry out production, and strive for a bumper harvest. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that implementing democratic cooperative management in production is not difficult. As long as cooperative cadres and members discuss and resolve the main and pressing issues that are conducive to production, they can devote all their efforts to production. The secondary and more complex issues can be resolved during the consolidation of the cooperatives after the autumn harvest.
    Currently, Party committees in various localities are taking measures to reverse the above two deviations.

    湖南反对农村工作中的两种偏向
    埋头生产，不去解决迫切的问题，空谈民主办社，放松对生产的领导，都是不对的。省委要求迅速扭转偏向，争取丰收。
    本报讯　中共湖南省委在5月27日召开地、市委书记电话会议，批判各地最近在农村工作中发生的两种偏向：一是空谈民主办社，脱离当前生产；一是埋头生产，明知存在着阻碍生产的主要问题，也不去解决。
    这两种偏向是省委几位书记最近深入农业社以后发现的。
    中共湖南省委在5月9日曾发出关于进一步贯彻民主办社争取农业大丰收的指示，强调民主办社和当前生产是完全一致的，必须紧密结合进行。但有的地方对于这个精神领会不够，在实际工作中还是孤立地进行。益阳县委怕民主办社会乱，会影响当前生产，在两次干部会上，对这个问题都强调不够，以致有的乡、社连民主办社四个字都不提，社内迫切要求解决的问题不能解决，社员情绪不高。相反地，在长沙、宁乡等县少数农业社里，则不顾农忙紧张的情况，照搬大城市“百家争鸣”的办法，漫无边际地发动社员找矛盾，白天黑夜开会，不仅影响了生产，而且对真正妨碍当前生产的主要问题却没有解决，并在社里制造了新的矛盾。省委批判埋头生产不解决问题的作风是主观主义。因为尽管主观上想搞好生产，如不解决迫切问题，生产还是搞不好。那种空谈矛盾，为民主而民主，放松对生产的领导的作风则是不顾实际情况生搬硬套的教条主义，对生产的妨害更大。
    省委要求各地迅速扭转上述两种偏向，抓紧六、七两个月宝贵时机，切实搞好生产，争取丰收。省委指出说，在生产中贯彻民主办社，并不困难，只要社干部和社员共同商量，解决有利于生产的主要的和迫切的问题，就可以全力搞生产，次要的比较复杂的问题，可在秋收后整社中解决。
    现在，各地党委正在采取措施，扭转上述两种偏向。
