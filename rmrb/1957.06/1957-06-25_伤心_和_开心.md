　　“Sadness” and “Happiness”
　　Xiárén
　　The victory of the revolution has brought great joy to the people of the whole country. However, people like Li Peiying, a member of the China Democratic League and an engineer at the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute, feel that "the revolution is worse than a change of dynasty" and "living in this society makes people very sad." (See People's Daily, June 12)
　　For people like Li Peiying, the "bad" aspects of the revolution are indeed numerous. The most fundamental "bad" aspect is that it overthrew the system of exploitation. Previous "changes of dynasty" did not have this "bad" aspect. At most, they replaced the old system of exploitation with a new one, the old exploiters with new ones. They still rode on the backs of the people, enslaving and exploiting them. But our revolution is so "iron-fisted and selfless" that it not only shattered the exploiters' thrones and pulled out the sucking tubes from their mouths but also required them to undergo a "thorough transformation." They are indeed "sad" enough.
　　The greatest sorrow for a person is when the things they rely on for a living and cherish so much disappear from their sight against their will, while the things they despise are born and grow before their eyes against their will. Look at how many things have happened in just eight years that have made people like Li Peiying "sad": The rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism over the Chinese people has disappeared, replaced by the unprecedented people's democratic dictatorship; the economy of bureaucrat-capitalism has disappeared, replaced by large-scale industries belonging to the people of the whole country; the land reform has destroyed the feudal economic base, and agricultural cooperation has uprooted the last vestiges of capitalism. Now, "joint public-private ownership" has replaced capitalist private ownership, and it will be further completely transferred to the people. ... All of this, for some people, is something they should grit their teeth and curse, but it is also a fact they cannot change. So they are "very sad."
　　However, I have already said that these earth-shattering changes that "make people very sad" are precisely what make the people of the whole country so happy. If people like Li Peiying were not "sad," then the revolution would not be a revolution. However, "sad" people can also be transformed into "happy" people; the key lies in whether they are determined to undergo a "thorough transformation."

　　“伤心”和“开心”
　　侠人
    革命的胜利，引起了全国人民的大开心，然而民盟盟员、天津民用建筑设计院工程师栗培英之流的人就感到“革命比改朝换代更坏”，“生活在这个社会里叫人很伤心”。（见6月12日人民日报）
    对栗培英们来说，革命的“坏”处确实不少。最根本的“坏”处，就在于它推翻了剥削制度。历来的“改朝换代”都是没有这点“坏”处的。至多也不过用新的剥削制度代替旧的剥削制度，新的剥削者代替旧的剥削者。他们仍然骑在人民头上，奴役和剥削人民。而我们的革命却如此“铁面无情”，不仅打碎了剥削者的宝座，拔去了他们嘴上的吸血管，而且还要他们经历一番“脱胎换骨”的改造。他们确是够“伤心”的了。
    人的最大的悲哀，莫过于自己所依以为生的、爱恋备至的东西，违反自己意志从面前逝去，而自己所敌视的东西又违反着自己的意志从面前出生，成长。请看，在短短的八年中，发生了多少使栗培英们“伤心”的事呀：帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义对中国人民的统治逝去了，而代之以史无前例的人民民主专政；官僚资本主义的经济逝去了，而出现了属于全国人民的大工业、土地改革摧毁了封建的经济基础，农业合作化又挖掉资本主义的最后根基。现在“公私合营”已代替了资本主义的私有，它还将进一步完全转归人民。……凡此一切，对某些人来说，都是应该咬牙切齿加以诅咒的，但又都是他们无法改变的事实。所以就“很伤心”了。
    然而我已经说过：这些“叫人很伤心”的翻天复地的变化，正是全国人民所大开心的。倘使栗培英们也不“伤心”，那革命就不成其为革命了。然而“伤心”人也未始不能转化为“开心”人，关键在于有没有决心经受“脱胎换骨”的改造。
