　　Recently, the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Ministry of Supervision of the State Council have investigated and confirmed that during the period from January to April 1956, serious incidents of large-scale famine migration and deaths of disaster victims occurred in Pingle, Lipu, and Heng counties in Guangxi Province. In our people's country under the leadership of the Party, although this incident was isolated, its nature was extremely serious and completely intolerable. Therefore, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to give the relevant derelict personnel Party disciplinary and administrative punishments respectively, and to announce the handling of this incident to educate the whole Party and all state personnel. Our Party and government are highly responsible to the people, and we must resolutely correct the shortcomings and errors in our work.
    Over the years, our Party and government have taken a series of major measures to achieve agricultural collectivization nationwide, which has led to relatively rapid development of agricultural production in our country, and the lives of our farmers have been significantly improved and raised, enhancing their ability to resist natural disasters to a certain extent. In particular, the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale has made it possible for the state to coordinate and mobilize grain nationwide to provide strong support to the people in disaster areas.
    However, due to the still low level of agricultural production in our country and the extremely complex geographical and natural conditions in various regions, there are certain droughts and famines every year. Even in years of bumper harvests, some places always experience reduced production or complete crop failure due to disasters. In the past eight years, China has experienced three major disasters, with an average of more than 100 million mu of land and more than 40 million people affected each year, resulting in a reduction of more than 10 billion jin of grain in these areas. Precisely because we considered the occurrence of disasters of varying sizes and severity every year as a long-term rather than a temporary phenomenon in such a large country, our Party and government have been implementing production and disaster relief as an extremely important policy since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In each year, the government has included disaster relief funds in the financial budget, allocated a large amount of disaster relief grain, and ordered governments at all levels to conscientiously implement disaster relief policies, and to promptly check and solve disaster relief problems, striving to ensure that no one dies of starvation due to natural disasters. According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, from 1949 to 1956, the state allocated more than 1.2979 billion yuan in disaster relief funds. The state has allocated 7 billion jin of disaster relief grain from last autumn to the present. Needless to say, only the people's own country can provide such a huge amount of grain and funds to relieve disaster victims and help the Chinese people overcome several major disasters in the past few years, which is unprecedented in history.
    As everyone knows, there have been many major famines in Chinese history, and the number of disaster victims who died of hunger and disease is staggering. Not to mention the distant past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the great flood in the Yangtze River basin in 1931 killed 3.7 million people, and the great flood in the Han River basin in 1935 also killed more than 3 million people. During the rule of the reactionary government, the phenomenon of large-scale famine migration and deaths of disaster victims was not considered strange by the officials of the reactionary government, who continued to embezzle, exploit, oppress, and slaughter the people as usual. Those people had no heart for the disaster victims and could not talk about the disaster relief work carried out by the People's Government today. But that was the old society. Our Communist Party and the staff of the People's Government will never allow a dismissive attitude towards the issue of disasters. We must not only lead the people to vigorously develop the country's production, and strive to reduce and mitigate natural disasters from a positive perspective; but also, after any natural disaster occurs, we must take a fully responsible attitude, thoroughly investigate the situation of the disaster, lead and organize the disaster victims to carry out production for self-relief, and provide all necessary relief to those in need. This is the duty of the Party and government organizations at all levels, and it is an important task that they must conscientiously do well. If any level of Party and government organization fails to fulfill this duty, fails to do what it should do, or does it poorly, resulting in the expansion of the disaster, or even the phenomenon of people starving to death, even if only a few individuals starve to death, it is an extremely serious incident. The Party and government must seriously and conscientiously deal with such incidents, on the one hand, to thoroughly investigate the causes of the incident in order to learn lessons and improve work; on the other hand, it must also give Party members and cadres who have committed serious errors the disciplinary action they deserve, and must not be lenient with them in any way.
    This incident of large-scale famine migration and deaths of disaster victims in Guangxi Province, although isolated from a national perspective, exposes the bureaucratic and subjectivist ideological style of some Party and government leaders in Guangxi Province who do not care about the suffering of the people, which is completely intolerable. It should be noted that the disaster situation in Guangxi Province in 1955 was serious, and in 1956 there was an unprecedented spring drought, which reduced the yield of early-maturing crops by about half, which to some extent increased the difficulty of disaster relief work. At the same time, Pingle, Lipu, and Heng counties, where the famine migration and deaths of disaster victims were relatively serious this time, have always been areas with high grain yields in Guangxi Province. These areas basically had bumper harvests in 1955, and only a few places experienced interspersed disasters, which also made it easy for cadres to see only the good side and ignore the bad side. However, despite these objective reasons, as long as the leading organs have a high mass viewpoint, as long as their work style is in-depth, this unfortunate incident is completely avoidable. But the fact is not the case. Some Party and government leaders in Guangxi Province, headed by Comrade Chen Manyuan, and some Party and government leaders in Pingle Special Zone, Pingle County, Lipu County, and Heng County, have developed serious complacency due to being satisfied with some achievements in their past work. They not only overestimated the grain yield of Guangxi Province in 1955 and failed to see or underestimated the severity of the spring famine in Guangxi Province in 1956; but also, after lower-level cadres reported the yield and disaster situation to them, many people did not believe it, and some even harshly criticized those who reported the situation. Under this serious bureaucracy and subjectivism, they could not take effective measures in time to stop the development of the disaster, and although there was grain and disaster relief funds, they were not distributed in time, so that a minor disaster became a major disaster, and the phenomenon of large-scale famine migration and deaths of disaster victims occurred. This is an extremely painful lesson.
    If the leaders of Guangxi Province had thoroughly investigated and studied the disaster situation at that time, then this incident could have been completely avoided. Our country is a socialist and people's democratic country, and the government serves the interests of the people. We have the superior conditions of agricultural collectivization, and we have rich experience in production and disaster relief. We have implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, which guarantees that we can completely transfer a large amount of grain to supply the people in the disaster areas. When the disaster occurred in Guangxi Province this time, it was not that there was no grain, but that the grain was not transferred in time.
    Of course, the personnel who made mistakes in this serious incident in Guangxi Province have also done many beneficial things for the Party and the people; and even in terms of disaster relief work, they are not completely without achievements. They saved the disaster victims in most of the disaster areas in Guangxi Province in 1956, and in 1957, due to accepting the lessons of 1956, they led the people of the whole province to safely overcome a spring famine that was more serious than in 1956. However, the fact that the disaster situation in Pingle, Lipu, and Heng counties became serious in 1956 shows that they were indeed seriously infected with the bad style of bureaucracy and subjectivism at that time. They like to report smooth situations and do not like to report unsmooth situations; they like to hear good things and do not like to hear bad things, thus losing the opportunity for disaster relief and causing a painful incident that could have been avoided. Therefore, we hope that through the handling of this incident in Guangxi, we can universally correct the unhealthy trend of reporting good news but not bad news, and listening to good news but not bad news throughout the Party. Of course, in the matter of disaster prevention and relief, we must not only resolutely oppose and prevent the error of overreporting production and reducing the disaster situation, but also prevent and oppose the error of concealing production and exaggerating the disaster situation, because these are irresponsible bureaucratic attitudes.
    Until now, our country is still a backward agricultural country, and we have not yet been able to completely avoid natural disasters in the short term. However, as long as we can thoroughly correct the shortcomings and errors in our work through this rectification movement and unite the people of the whole country more closely around the Party, we will not only have the confidence and determination to overcome natural disasters, but we will also surely build our country into a prosperous, industrialized, and socialist country.

### 坚决同漠视民命的官僚主义作斗争

　　坚决同漠视民命的官僚主义作斗争
    最近，中共中央监察委员会和国务院监察部已经查明，在1956年1月到4月这段时间里，广西省平乐、荔浦和横县等地区发生了灾民大批逃荒和死亡的严重事件。在我们党领导下的人民国家里，这个事件虽然是个别的，但是它的性质是极严重的，是完全不能容忍的。因此，党中央和国务院决定分别给予有关的失职人员以党纪处分和行政处分，并且公布这个事件的处理情况，以教育全党和全体国家工作人员。我们的党和政府对人民是高度负责的，我们一定要坚决纠正工作中的缺点和错误。
    这些年来，我们的党和政府曾经采取了一系列的重大措施，在全国范围内实现了农业合作化，使我国的农业生产有了比较迅速的发展，我国农民的生活有了比较显著的改善和提高，在一定的程度上增强了抵抗天灾的能力。尤其是实行统购统销的政策，国家就有可能统筹调动全国的粮食，给灾区人民以有力的支持。
    但是，由于原来我国农业生产的水平仍然很低，各个地区的地理和自然条件又极为复杂，每年都有一定的灾荒，甚至在大丰收的年代，也总是有一些地方因灾减产或者颗粒不收。在过去的八年中，我国曾经发生过三次大灾，平均每年有一亿多亩土地和四千多万人受灾，在这些地区减产粮食一百多亿斤。正因为考虑到每年有或大或小、或轻或重的灾荒的出现，在我们这样一个大国里是一种长期的而不是暂时的现象，所以从中华人民共和国成立的时候起，我们的党和政府就把生产救灾当作一项极其重要的政策来执行。在每个年度，政府都把救灾款列入了财政预算，都拨出了大批的救灾粮，并且责成各级政府认真执行救灾政策，及时地检查解决救灾问题，力求作到不因自然灾害而饿死一个人。根据内务部的统计，从1949年到1956年，国家拨出的救灾款有十二亿九千七百九十多万元。国家拨出的救灾粮，从去年秋季到现在，就有七十亿斤。不用说，只有人民自己的国家，才能拿出这样巨大数量的粮款来救济灾民，才帮助我国人民在过去的几年中战胜了几次重大灾害的袭击，这在历史上是空前未有的。
    大家都知道，我国历史上曾经发生过多次大灾荒，灾民因饿因病而死亡的数字是惊人的。远的不说，只是在国民党反动统治的时期，1931年长江流域的大水灾就死了三百七十万人，1935年汉水流域的大水灾也死了三百多万人。在反动政府统治的时期，发生了灾民大批逃荒和死亡的现象，反动政府的官员是不以为奇的，他们还是照常贪污，照常剥削、压迫和屠杀人民。那些人对于灾民是毫无心肝的，他们根本谈不到像今天人民政府所进行的救灾工作。但是那是旧社会的事了。我们共产党和人民政府的工作人员，决不容许用漠不关心的态度来对待灾荒问题。我们不但要领导人民大力发展国家的生产事业，从积极方面努力减少和减轻自然灾害；而且在任何自然灾害发生以后，都必须采取完全负责的态度，切实地查清灾害发生的情况，领导和组织灾民进行生产自救，并且给予一切需要救济的人以必要的救济。这是党和政府的各级组织应尽的职责，是它们必须认真做好的一项重要任务。如果任何一级党和政府的组织没有尽到这一职责，应当做的事情没有做，或者做得不好，以致灾情扩大，甚至发生了饿死人的现象，那怕只饿死了个别的和少数的人，就是极严重的事件。对于这样的事件，党和政府必须严肃认真地加以处理，一方面要切实地查明事件发生的原因，以便从中吸取教训，改进工作；另一方面还必须给予犯有严重错误的党员、干部以应得的纪律处分，决不能对他们有任何姑息。
    这次广西省大批灾民逃荒和死亡的事件，从全国范围来看，虽然是个别的，但是这个事件所暴露出来的广西省一些党政领导人不关心人民疾苦的官僚主义和主观主义的思想作风，却是完全不能容忍的。应当说明，1955年广西省的灾情是严重的，1956年又发生了多年未有的春旱，以致早熟作物减产一半左右，这在一定程度上增加了救灾工作的困难。同时，这次灾民逃荒和死亡比较严重的平乐、荔浦和横县等地区，向来是广西省粮食产量高的地区，这些地区在1955年基本上又是丰收，只有少数地方发生了插花式的灾情，这也使得干部容易只看见了好的一面，而忽略了不好的一面。但是，尽管有这样一些客观的原因，只要领导机关具有高度的群众观点，只要它们的工作作风是深入的，这个不幸的事件是完全可以避免的。可是事实并不是这样。以陈漫远同志为首的广西省一部分党政领导者和平乐专区、平乐县、荔浦县、横县的一部分党政领导者，由于满足于过去工作中的一些成绩而产生了严重的骄傲自满情绪。他们不仅过高地估计了1955年广西省的粮食产量，看不见或者低估了1956年广西省春荒成灾的严重性；而且在下级干部向他们报告了产量和灾情以后，许多人还不相信，有的人甚至对报告情况者发出粗暴的批评。在这种严重的官僚主义和主观主义之下，他们就不可能及时地采取有效的措施制止灾情的发展，虽然有粮食、有救济款而没有及时地发放，以致轻灾变成了重灾，发生了灾民大批逃荒和死亡的现象。这是一个极为沉痛的教训。
    如果广西省的领导人员当时切实调查研究了灾情，那末，这次事件完全可以避免。我们的国家是社会主义的、人民民主的国家，政府是为人民的利益服务的。我们有农业合作化的优越条件，我们有生产救灾的丰富经验。我们实行了粮食的统购统销政策，这就保证了我们完全能够把大量的粮食调去供应灾区的人民。这次广西省发生灾情的时候，并不是没有粮食，而是有粮食没有及时的调用。
    当然，广西省在这次严重事件中犯错误的人员，也曾经为党和人民作过许多有益的事；而且就是在救灾工作方面，他们也并不是完全没有成绩。他们在1956年救活了广西省大部灾区的灾民，而在1957年，由于接受了1956年的教训，他们领导全省人民安全地渡过了比1956年更严重的春荒。但是，1956年平乐、荔浦、横县的灾情严重化的事实说明，他们当时确是严重地沾染了官僚主义、主观主义的恶劣作风。他们喜欢报告顺利的情况，不喜欢报告不顺利的情况；喜欢听好的事情，不喜欢听不好的事情，因而丧失了救灾的时机，造成了本来可以避免的惨痛事件。因此，我们希望通过对广西的这次事件的处理，在全党普遍地纠正报喜不报忧和听喜不听忧的歪风。当然，在防灾和救灾这件事情上，我们不但要坚决反对和防止多报产量和缩小灾情的错误，同时也要防止和反对隐瞒产量和夸大灾情的错误，因为这都是不负责任的官僚主义态度。
    直到现在，我们的国家还是一个落后的农业国，我们还没有可能在短时期内完全避免自然灾害。但是，只要我们能够通过这次的整风运动，切实地改正工作中的缺点和错误，把全国人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围，我们就不仅有信心、有决心战胜自然灾害，而且一定会把我国建设成为一个富强的工业化的社会主义国家。
