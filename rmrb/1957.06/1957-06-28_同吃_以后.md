    After "Eating Together"
    It's a good thing that the cadres of our school's Communist Youth League committee have left the comfortable small dining hall and come down to the large dining hall to eat with the students. However, some League cadres have been down here for almost a month and still don't know the students they eat with at the same table. They don't even talk to them, just silently finish their meal and leave on their own.

    “同吃”以后
    我们学校团委会的干部，离开了舒适的小食堂，下到大膳厅来和同学们在一块吃饭，这是好现象。但是，有些团干部下来快一个月了，还不认识同桌吃饭的同学，连话也不同他们谈，只是默默地吃完饭就顾自走了。
