    Leave Straw for Braiding Straw Hats
    Straw hat braids are exquisite handicrafts. Our country's straw hat braids not only meet the needs of the broad masses of the people in our country, but are also well-known abroad.

    The stalks of some varieties of wheat are the raw material for straw hat braids (the stalks of some varieties cannot be used). The lack of wheat stalks directly affects the production of straw hat braids. Wheat has matured, and all localities should have plans for handling wheat stalks, taking into account the needs of the community, the needs of the members, and the needs of handicrafts.　　　　Jia Qinggui

    留下编草帽辫的麦秆
    草帽辫是精致的手工制品。我国的草帽辫不但能满足本国广大群众的需要，在国外也很出名。
    有些品种的小麦的麦秆是草帽辫的原料（有的品种的麦秆不能用），小麦秆的缺乏，直接影响到草帽辫的生产。小麦已经成熟了，各地在处理麦秆上应该有计划，社里用、社员用和手工业的需要，都要加以照顾。　　　　贾清贵
