    The people from all walks of life in China's capital solemnly held a conference, warmly supporting the World Peace Council meeting to be held in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, and wishing the meeting brilliant success. They also entrusted the following opinions to the Chinese delegation headed by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, to take to the Colombo meeting.
    The conference unanimously agreed that it is of great significance that the World Peace Council is holding its first meeting in Asia. We believe that under the common goal of defending peace and opposing war, it will strengthen the unity and cooperation of the people of all countries in the world, promote the struggle against the threat of nuclear weapons and the cessation of hydrogen bomb tests, promote the spirit of Bandung and the spirit of Geneva, and promote the early realization of consultations between major powers, and make new contributions to further easing the current international situation and promoting the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    The Chinese people firmly oppose the U.S. government's stubborn refusal to ban the use and testing of nuclear weapons, its insistence on a policy of atomic blackmail and a policy of arms expansion and war preparation. The United States is also stepping up the expansion of atomic bases and atomic forces around the world, promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" of aggression against the Arab people in the Middle East and Near East, and is brazenly interfering in and infringing upon the sovereignty and independence of other countries. Recently, it openly transported missiles to Taiwan, our country's territory, seriously threatening peace and security in Asia and the world. This is intolerable to the Chinese people and the people of the world!
    The conference unanimously expressed its support for the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals and its demand for the conclusion of an international agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, and reiterated that the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America against colonialism! Support the just struggle of the Arab people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and support all efforts in the world against war and for peace.
    The Chinese people will take more active action to build our own motherland, unite more closely with all peace-loving forces in the world, and strive together to resolutely oppose colonialism and safeguard lasting world peace.

    中国首都各界人民支持世界和平理事会科伦坡会议大会决议
    中国首都各界人民隆重举行大会，热烈支持即将在锡兰首都科伦坡召开的世界和平理事会会议，预祝会议获得辉煌成就，并且将下列意见委托给以中国人民保卫世界和平委员会郭沫若主席为首的中国代表团，带到科伦坡会议去。
    大会一致认为，世界和平理事会第一次在亚洲开会，具有非常重大的意义。我们相信，它将在保卫和平、反对战争的共同目标下，对加强世界各国人民的团结合作，对推动世界反核武器威胁和停止氢弹试验的斗争，对发扬万隆精神和日内瓦精神并促进大国协商的早日实现，对进一步缓和当前国际局势和促进亚洲及世界的和平事业，作出新的贡献。
    中国人民坚决反对美国政府顽固地拒绝禁止使用和试验核武器，坚持原子讹诈政策和扩军备战政策。美国还在世界各地加紧扩建原子基地和原子部队，在中近东推行侵略阿拉伯人民的“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且横蛮地干涉和侵犯他国的主权和独立，最近，又公然将导弹运往我国的领土台湾，严重地威胁亚洲及世界的和平和安全，这是中国人民和全世界人民不能容忍的！
    大会一致表示拥护苏联的裁军建议和要求缔结停止试验核武器的国际协定的主张，并且重申中国人民完全支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义的正义斗争！支持阿拉伯人民维护民族独立和主权的正义斗争，支持世界上一切反对战争，争取和平的努力。
    中国人民将更积极地行动起来，努力建设我们自己的祖国，更紧密地团结世界上一切爱好和平的力量，为坚决反对殖民主义和维护世界持久和平而共同奋斗。
