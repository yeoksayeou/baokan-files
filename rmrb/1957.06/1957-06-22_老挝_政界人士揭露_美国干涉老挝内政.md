　　Laos—Political Figures Expose
    US Interference in Laotian Internal Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 21st: Vientiane Dispatch: A Laotian political figure, "who wishes to remain anonymous," recently published an article in the irregularly published "Peace" newspaper, exposing some of the unsavory activities conducted behind the scenes by the United States during the Laotian cabinet crisis.
    The article, titled "Question Mark," raises a series of questions. It writes: Is Laos truly independent? That is, does the National Assembly have the freedom to choose a government and its political path without being subjected to pressure from others? These are questions that people should ask in light of some of the activities occurring behind the scenes during the current cabinet crisis.
    The article states: Why is the US Embassy actively interfering in matters that are internal to Laos? Why is America's generous aid conditioned on Laos's domestic policies aligning with American views? Why is the US Ambassador becoming the architect of the policies of the new Laotian cabinet? If this is improper, what do the US Embassy's blatant conspiratorial activities signify? The article says, what does it mean that Mr. Parsons (referring to the US Ambassador to Laos, Parsons) attended a meeting at the home of a Laotian cabinet minister in recent days?
    The article also criticizes the activities of the British Ambassador to Laos in coordination with the US Ambassador. The article says, is this how democratic countries demonstrate their respect for Laotian independence?
    Are these conspiratorial activities compatible with diplomatic rules?
    The article states: To all these questions, our answer is no. It is time to stop these activities, which are fundamentally intolerable and harm our national interests.

　　老挝—政界人士揭露
    美国干涉老挝内政
    新华社河内21日电　万象消息：一位“不愿发表名字”的老挝政界人士最近在不定期出版的“和平”报上发表文章，揭露了美国在老挝发生内阁危机期间，在幕后进行的一些不可告人的活动。
    这篇以“问号”为题的文章提出了一系列的问题，它写道：老挝是不是真正独立的呢？就是说，国会是不是有自由选择政府和它的政治方式而不至于受到旁人的压制呢？这是人们对当前内阁危机中幕后发生的一些活动所应当提出的问题。
    文章说，为什么美国大使馆要积极地干涉属于老挝本身的问题？为什么美国的慷慨援助要以老挝的对内政策符合于美国的看法为条件？为什么美国大使要成为老挝新内阁的政策的策划者？如果这是不正当的话，美国大使馆露骨的阴谋活动又意味着什么？文章说，最近几天，帕先生（指美国驻老挝大使帕森斯）参加了在一位老挝内阁部长家里举行的会议又说明了什么呢？
    文章还抨击了英国驻老挝大使配合美国大使所进行的活动。文章说，难道民主国家这样来证明它们对老挝独立的尊重吗？
    这些阴谋活动是不是同外交规则相容呢？
    文章说：对于这一切问题，我们的回答是否定的，现在应该是停止这些在原则上不可容忍的、损害了我们民族利益的阴谋的时候了。
