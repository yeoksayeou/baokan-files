Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: The Standing Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association held its 37th meeting this afternoon and resolved to remove Zhang Naiqi from his position as the representative of the China National Democratic Construction Association on the Guangming Daily Editorial Board and to elect Sun Xiaocun, a member of the Central Standing Committee, to take this position.

    The committee members attending the meeting pointed out that Zhang Naiqi's recent remarks exposed his serious capitalist ideology, and he can no longer represent the China National Democratic Construction Association in participating in the work of Guangming Daily.

    The committee members also requested the Guangming Daily Editorial Board to conduct a review of the bourgeois direction that has recently emerged and pointed out that Zhang Bojun, the President of Guangming Daily, should bear great responsibility.
