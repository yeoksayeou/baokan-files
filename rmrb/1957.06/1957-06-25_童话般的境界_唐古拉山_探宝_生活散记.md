　　A Fairytale Realm
　　——A Scattered Account of "Treasure Hunting" Life in the Tanggula Mountains
　　Yan Shugui
	The Tanggula Mountains – this great mountain, as famous as the Bayan Har Mountains and the Altai Mountains of our motherland, stands at an altitude of five to six thousand meters above sea level, at the junction of southwestern Qinghai and Tibet. When you take the Qinghai-Tibet Highway bus and come before it for the first time, you must take a good look. The overlapping purple-gray mountains, the sparkling snow-capped mountains and glaciers, and the snow-capped peaks reaching into the clouds, what a beautiful picture! When you step into its embrace step by step, there are many novel things attracting you. Hailstorms accompanied by thunder and lightning, thin air, and piercing cold seem to be intimidating you, to see if you have the courage; while the dazzling specular hematite, the glittering crystal caves, and the exposed lead-zinc mines seem to be beckoning you, encouraging you to explore the secrets in its chest!
	For thousands of years, the Tanggula Mountains have been a mystery, with only some beautiful legends and terrifying speculations. Now, our young geological personnel are active in this mysterious place for the first time, launching a thrilling and intense "treasure hunting" struggle.
	Nature's "Tightening Spell"
	No matter who it is, once they enter the "sphere of influence" of the Tanggula Mountains, they will encounter its first "deterrent" - altitude sickness. Dizziness, headache, vomiting, and shortness of breath, just like a chronically ill person, weak and powerless, with difficulty moving. People jokingly say that it is as if Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" heard the "Tightening Spell" chanted by Tang Seng, and everyone had to shout about headaches. Cooking here uses dried yak dung as fuel, which needs to be transported by Tibetan people with yaks from places hundreds of miles away, which is already very difficult; what is worse is that when a fire is lit under the pot, the rice is always undercooked. The rice is half-cooked, the steamed buns are sticky, and the green beans in the porridge never bloom. Helpless, everyone had to put the steamed buns in the fire to bake, peeling them off layer by layer to eat. Precisely in this situation, everyone couldn't eat much, at most one steamed bun per person per day. How can we work like this?
	The geological team is full of young adults, usually all full of energy. But as soon as they entered the worksite, many people's heads drooped. Zhang Runquan and other four young people were so sick that they lay in bed, losing weight day by day. The leaders decided to send them to Xining for treatment. As the car drove on the road to Xining, they felt gradually better. When they arrived at Golmud, which is only two thousand meters above sea level, without any treatment, they all became well, and could eat four or five steamed buns in one meal. These young men were so happy, "We don't believe we can't stay in the Tanggula Mountains, let's stay a little longer and see what it can do to us!" They did not continue to Xining, but turned back to the worksite. After arriving at the worksite, they walked slowly around the驻地 (zhùdì, garrison) every day, slowly climbed small hills, and did some light labor. After a long time, the young men were all trained, and they were jumping and laughing again, just like on ordinary mountains.
	Thunder, Lightning and Hail
	The climate on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau changes drastically, and in the Tanggula Mountains, which are five to six thousand meters above sea level, it is even more unpredictable. Even if you only see a very small cloud in the sky, often in the blink of an eye, a strong wind rises, and dark clouds rush forward and backward like waves, and in a short while, they surround the mountain. Then comes the thunder, echoing around the mountain like a string of firecrackers. Lightning flashes near people. Dense hailstones hit head-on, causing pain and burning in people's cheeks and ears.
	What's even more troublesome is that such hailstorms don't happen once or twice a day, but five, six, seven, or eight times. Just when you spread out the drawings and are working hard, the hail comes rustling down.
	Faced with such sudden attacks, some people were indeed flustered at first. There is a story circulating on the worksite: one day, technician Li Shichao was lying on the drawing board drawing, and his assistant told him that the weather was about to change. Li Shichao continued to work while answering without raising his head, "It's almost done, there's only a little bit left, I'll finish it and leave immediately." Unexpectedly, as soon as he finished speaking, the hail came rattling down. He quickly turned over the drawing board to prevent the drawings from being damaged, but his hand went numb when he pressed the drawing board, because the wet wooden board was already electrified. Touching his head, the static electricity on his hair also crackled. He was so scared that he ran down quickly.
	Now, this matter is just a joke. People have already figured out a set of methods to deal with thunder and lightning. When they see hail coming, people put the easily electrified items such as geological hammers and leather hats away at a distance, and find a low-lying place to squat down. This way, there is no danger. However, this method is quite troublesome and not time-efficient. People have even simpler methods. Turn the drawing board over and cover your face, lie down on the ground, so that the body does not become a conductor for sharp discharge, and just let it hit! The whole body is covered with hair, leather coats, leather pants, and leather boots, which are very thick, so it doesn't hurt anyway. After twenty or thirty minutes, when the sky clears, you can get up and continue working as usual.
	Glaciers, Snow Peaks
	The western part of the Tanggula Mountain mining area is full of glaciers, snow mountains, and snow peaks. Looking down from the cracked ice crevices, you can't see the soil for dozens of meters. The glaciers cut the mountains into fin-shaped and triangular shapes. The highest peak, 6,800 meters above sea level, is like a cold, gleaming blade that pierces straight into the sky. Geologists call it the Tanggula Mountain Snow Peak. Hard, steep, and cold, it is very difficult to climb.
	There are even more worrying things on the snow mountain, that is, ice crevices and stones. An ice crevice is often several meters wide and dozens of meters deep, so deep that you can't see the bottom at a glance. The stones exposed on the ice layer, some are hundreds of cubic meters, some are dozens of cubic meters, which are cracked open by frost weathering. They look stably placed, but maybe if you step on it, grab it, or even a thunderclap vibrates it, it will rumble down.
	However, in this world of ice and snow, very valuable ore is stored - crystal ore. Standing on the glacier and looking west, you can see many oval crystal caves, like mythical "crystal palaces." Transparent, angular crystals reflect each other, simply dazzling and beautiful!
	The personality of geological personnel is like this: as long as there are mineral deposits, no matter how great the difficulties, they will find ways to overcome them. After selecting a route with a gentler slope and relatively safe, they use hammers to knock out some pits step by step and climb up step by step. After the work is completed, they step back down step by step. Some frequently visited places have an iron stake driven into the high place, and a rope is tied to it. When going up, you climb up by grasping it, and when going down, you slide down by pulling the rope.
	In such a difficult environment, last year, the 636 and 680 geological survey teams have conducted surveys over an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers, proving that the Tanggula Mountains are a polymetallic mining area. Not only are there iron mines, but also lead-zinc mines, crystals, and copper.
	In this fairytale world, the brave are creating more and greater miracles!

　　童话般的境界
　　——唐古拉山“探宝”生活散记
　　燕树桂
    唐古拉山——这座与祖国的巴颜喀拉山、阿尔泰山齐名的大山，耸立在青海西南部跟西藏交接的地方，拔海五、六千公尺。当你乘坐着青藏公路的汽车，第一次来到它的跟前的时候，你就尽情的看吧。那紫灰色的重叠的山峦，那银光闪闪的雪山和冰川，还有那高接云天的雪峰，是一幅多么美丽的图画啊！当你一步步踏进它的胸怀，就又有许多新奇的事物在吸引你了。雷电交加下的冰雹，稀薄的空气，凛冽的寒冰，似乎在恐吓你，看你有没有勇气；而光泽夺目的镜铁矿，亮光闪闪的水晶洞，露头的铅锌矿，却又仿佛在向你招手，鼓舞着你去探测它胸中的秘密！
    千百年来，唐古拉山一直是个谜，有的只是一些美丽的传说和恐怖的揣测。现在，我们年青的地质人员第一次活跃在这个神秘的地方，展开了惊险紧张的“探宝”斗争。
    大自然念的“紧箍咒”
    不论是谁，一走进唐古拉山的“势力范围”，就会碰到它的第一个“下马威”——高山病。头晕，头痛，呕吐，气喘，简直像久病的人一样，虚弱无力，行动困难。人们开玩笑说，这仿佛是“西游记”中的孙行者，听到唐僧念的“紧箍咒”，一个个都不得不喊头痛。在这儿做饭，用的燃料是干牛粪，要靠藏民用牦牛从百十里路远的地方运来，这本来已很困难；更糟糕的是，锅下生起火，饭总是作不熟。饭是夹生的，馒头是粘的，稀饭里的绿豆老是不开花。无奈何，大家只好把蒸好的馒头又放到火里烤，一层一层地剥着吃。恰恰在这种情况下，大家又吃不下饭去，充其量一人一天只能吃一个馒头。这怎么样工作啊？
    地质队都是青壮年，平时个个都是生龙活虎的。但是一进入工地，不少人脑袋就搭拉下来了。张润泉等四个青年，病得躺在床上，一天天消瘦下去。领导上决定送他们到西宁去治疗。汽车走在到西宁去的路上，他们觉得慢慢地好起来了。等到一到拔海二千多公尺的噶尔穆，没有经过治疗，一个个都变成了好人，一顿饭能吃下四、五个馒头。这几个小伙子可高兴啦，“就不相信唐古拉山呆不下去，再住一些时间看它还能把人怎么样！”他们没有继续往西宁去，又折回头返回工地。到工地以后，他们天天在驻地附近慢慢地散步，慢慢地爬小山 头，做一些轻微的劳动。时间一久，小伙子们都锻炼出来啦，像在一般山地上一样，又是蹦蹦跳跳，有说有笑了。
    雷电和冰雹
    青藏高原上的气候变化很剧烈，在拔海五、六千公尺的唐古拉山上，更是变化莫测。眼看着天际不过有很小的一朵云彩，可是往往转眼之间，狂风大作，乌云像水浪似地前推后涌而来，一会儿工夫就把个山头团团围住。接着而来的便是霹雳巨响，像连珠炮似的在山头四周回荡。电光在人们左近闪耀。密密的冰雹，劈头迎面袭来，打得人两颊两耳发痛发烧。
    更叫人伤脑筋的是，这样的冰雹，一天不是一两次，而是五、六次、七、八次。刚把图纸展开，干得正起劲，冰雹就呼呼啦啦地来了。
    对于这样突如其来的袭击，开初的确也有些人慌乱了手脚。工地上流传着这样一个故事：技术员李世超有一天正伏在图板上绘图，助手告诉他天要变了。李世超一边加紧工作，一边头也没抬地回答道：“快完啦，只剩一点点，作完马上就走。”没想到话音刚落，冰雹就噼呖啪啦地打来了。他赶紧去翻图板，防止图纸被打烂，可是手一按图板就麻了，原来淋湿的木板已经通电。一摸脑袋，头发上的静电也吱吱直响。吓得他连窜带跑赶紧跑了下来。
  现在，这件事只是一个笑料。人们已经摸索出了一套对付雷电冰雹的办法。一看冰雹要来，人们就把容易通电的衣物像地质锤、皮帽等向远处一放，找块低洼的地方蹲下来。这样什么危险也没有。不过这个办法挺费事，时间上不经济。人们还有更简便的方法。把图板翻过来往脸上一盖，身子往地上一躺，人身不致成为一个导体发生尖端放电，就豁出来叫它打吧！浑身上下都是毛，皮袄，皮裤，皮靴，厚得很，反正打不痛。二、三十分钟以后，天一放晴，就可以爬起来照常工作了。
    冰川、雪峰
    唐古拉山西矿区的西部全是冰川、雪山和雪峰。从裂开的冰隙向下看去，几十公尺深都看不到土壤。冰川把山脉切割成鳍脊形和三角形。最高的山峰，拔海六千八百公尺，像一把冷光四射的利刃一直插向天际。地质人员们把它叫做唐古拉山雪峰。坚硬，陡峭，寒冷，要攀上去十分困难。
    在雪山上还有更叫人担心的东西，那就是冰隙和石头。一个冰隙，常常有几公尺宽、几十公尺深，深得一眼望不到底。暴露在冰层上的石头，有百十方的，有几十方的，那是由于霜辟作用炸裂开来的。看去摆得稳稳的，可是说不定脚一踩，手一攀，甚至雷声一震动，就会哗哗地滚下来。
    可是，就在这个冰雪的世界里，却贮藏着很宝贵的矿石——水晶矿。站在冰川上，向西望去，就可以看到许多椭圆形的晶洞，像一座座神话中的“水晶宫”。透明的棱角分明的水晶，互相辉映，简直琳琅满目，美不胜收！
    地质人员的性格就是这样：只要有矿藏，那怕有天大的困难，他们也会想出办法去克服。在选出一条坡度比较缓比较安全的线路以后，他们就用锤子一步步敲上一些坑坑，一步步向上爬去。工作完了，又一步步倒退下来。一些常去的地方，便在高处打一根铁桩，拴上一根绳子，上的时候，攀着上去，下的时候又拉着绳子滑下来。
    就在这样艰难的环境里，去年，636、680两个地质普查队已经在几万平方公里的面积上进行了普查，证明唐古拉山是一个多金属的矿区。不仅有铁矿，而且有铅锌矿、水晶和铜。
    在这童话般的世界里，勇士们正在创造着更多更大的奇迹！
