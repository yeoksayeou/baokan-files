    Turning Weak Seedlings into Strong Seedlings
    (Our Wuhan dispatch) In order to strive for increased agricultural production, Hubei Province is actively trying to turn weak seedlings into strong seedlings. Currently, poorly growing rice seedlings account for approximately 10% to 15% of the total paddy field area; poorly growing cotton seedlings account for about 20% of the total cotton field area. These seedlings have yellow leaves and thin stems, mainly due to fertilizer deficiency in the farmland, and secondly due to pests and diseases.
    Currently, county committees in various regions have convened telephone conferences and on-site meetings, and mobilized a large number of cadres and farmers to pay attention to this work. The Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Laifeng County found that 600 mu of seedlings out of 1,400 mu were growing poorly. The management committee quickly organized labor to weed and purchased fertilizer from cooperative members with cash for topdressing. Xishi Township in Yingcheng County adopted the method of using lights at night to lure and kill rice stem borers, eliminating more than 210,000 borers in one night. In the Jingzhou Special District, 892 cooperatives in four counties have established a system of household responsibility for field management to ensure the healthy growth of seedlings.

    把弱苗变成壮苗
    本报武汉电　湖北各地为了争取农业增产，正积极设法把弱苗变成壮苗。目前水稻生长不良的禾苗大约占水田总面积10％至15％；生长不好的棉花苗约占棉地总面积20％左右。这些苗叶黄茎瘦，原因是农田缺肥；其次是病虫害。
    目前各地县委会召开了电话会议和战地会议，并动员大批干部和农民重视这项工作。来凤县星星农业社，检查出一千四百亩秧苗中有六百亩苗生长不良，管理委员会即迅速组织劳力——薅草，同时以现金收买社员的肥料进行追肥。应城县西十乡采用夜间点灯诱杀螟蛾的办法，一夜捕灭螟蛾二十一万多个。荆州专区四个县有八百九十二个社建立分户管田责任制，保证禾苗健壮地生长。
