　　The "Religious Revival" in American Universities
　　Cui Qi
    According to American newspapers, the number of religious students in American universities has increased significantly in recent years, and the religious atmosphere in many universities and colleges is becoming increasingly strong. Some even call this phenomenon a "religious revival."

    The Great Quest of Three Million Young Men and Women
    The American "Newsweek" recently introduced some information about this "religious revival." It wrote: "From the quiet corners of Harvard University to the bustling western university campuses, an astonishing number of the three million young men and women currently studying in American colleges and universities are engaged in a huge, spontaneous quest. ... An unprecedented number of people are pursuing God." It is said that this is the largest "religious quest" in American educational history.

    To accommodate this quest, many universities and colleges have added new courses: "Religious Psychology," "Elementary Hebrew," "The Life and Teachings of Jesus," and so on. Now, two-thirds of the state universities have decided to give credits for religious courses. As a result, listening to theologians' lectures has become a craze. For example, Harvard University's theology professor Paul Tillich will visit twenty campuses this academic year, and universities have already booked his lectures until May 1958.

    "In addition to this desire for spiritual knowledge (?), more and more college students today also hope to worship God." Religious activities in many schools have become a spectacle. At Stanford University, about two thousand students get up early on Easter morning to perform dawn worship. The number of people participating in Wednesday evening candlelight services has also increased dozens of times compared to ten years ago. Among the 22,000 students at the University of Michigan, nearly 5,000 attend worship at least once a week. At Wheaton College, a non-denominational school in Illinois, 1,600 students are required to attend morning prayers six days a week, as well as evening prayers five nights a week...

    Most notable is Harvard University. "Newsweek" says that when the university was founded in 1636, it determined its purpose as "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity." In the two hundred years since then, Harvard University has become increasingly "independent of idealistic religion," and the theological seminary founded in 1816 has been "ineffective and neglected." However, in recent years, this less religious Harvard University has also become a center for theological education and religious activities. Although the seminary's funds have increased several times, more than one hundred freshmen who wanted to enter the seminary this academic year were still rejected because the school could not accommodate them.

    Like Needing a Hot Water Bottle
    What forces are guiding American college students to such a passionate yearning for religion? Are they all devout believers? "Newsweek" wrote: "This is not to say that ... every young person in college today is very devout. Many of them are far from it. New York City's Templeton, who has presided over many youth revival meetings, believes that many college students 'seem to ask God as you might want a hot water bottle at night to relieve a temporary discomfort.'"

    As a pastor, Templeton would certainly not mock religion, and he is not even mocking these college students. His words only confirm the fact that the passion of these college students for religion cannot be explained solely by religion itself.

    What is a hot water bottle? It is just something that has use value when a person is thirsty; and in the eyes of these college students, religion is exactly like that. Therefore, rather than saying they "believe" in religion, it is better to say they "need" religion, need it to relieve some kind of spiritual "discomfort."

    A Strong Sense of Emptiness
    Washington University religion professor Sidlow also admitted: "What is driving this movement is a strong sense of emptiness, a pursuit of something they don't even know themselves." He said, "Not long ago, a student said to me, 'If you don't know where the goal is, what's the point of kicking the ball?'"

    Indeed, if you don't know what the goal of life is, what is the meaning of life? Terrible emptiness! This is the spiritual state of many American college students. It is in this "spiritual vacuum" that religion has become the answer for some people. A Harvard University student said: "There seems to be no other answer besides religion. Our generation is a generation that seeks faith, and students want to know what life means besides getting bad grades. I think a person must believe in God..."

    Where Do They Want to Lead the Youth?
    From this gray picture of the so-called "religious revival," we see how distressed, bewildered, and listless many American youths are. They cannot find a way out of life and cannot see a bright future. Before they have truly stepped into social life, they have already felt the various threats in society. Thus, in the minds of many college students, there appears a surprisingly simple formula for life: in school, only hope to get good grades. In society, only hope to find a good job. If you feel some spiritual discomfort, then go to religion to seek relief. Are they free? Yes, they are free! They are free to not think, free to give up the right to real life, free to waste their youthful vitality like a useless candle. As a result, religion is "revived," but the new generation withers; God is believed in, but the spirit of real people declines.

    However, we cannot regard the "religious revival" in American universities as completely spontaneous. As "Newsweek" reported, this "religious revival" is led by figures like Harvard University President Pusey. In order to meet the needs of monopoly capital, the American ruling class and its educational authorities always hope that young people will not see social and political problems, or even forget about real life altogether, and become drowsy, non-competitive people. In this way, monopoly capital groups can fill the "spiritual vacuum" of young people with their will as they please. Where do they want to lead the youth? According to Pusey, it seems to be leading them to the "edge of progress," but we don't need to explore it to determine that this is utter irony. In reality, they just want to use the name of God, use the whip of the spirit, to drive the younger generation to serve their "paradise" of maximum profit.

### 美国大学里的“宗教复兴”

　　美国大学里的“宗教复兴”
　　崔奇
    据美国报刊报道，近些年来美国大学生信仰宗教的人数显著增加，许多大学和学院里的宗教气氛越来越浓厚了。有人甚至把这种现象叫做“宗教复兴”。
    三百万男女青年的大探求
    美国“新闻周刊”最近介绍了关于这个“宗教复兴”的一些情况。它写道：“从哈佛大学的僻静地方到喧嚣的西部各大学校园，有数目大得惊人的目前在美国学院和大学里学习的三百万男女青年，在进行一种巨大的、自发的探求。……数目空前的人们在追求上帝。”据说，这是美国教育史上最大的一次“宗教的探求”。
    为了适应这个探求，许多大学和学院增加了新的课程：“宗教心理学”，“希伯来文初阶”，“耶稣的生平和教导”等等。现在已有三分之二的州立大学决定给予宗教课程的学分。于是，听神学家的讲课，形成一种热潮。例如，哈佛大学的神学教授波耳·提利奇在这个学年内将访问二十个校园，各大学预约他的讲课已排到1958年5月了。
    “除了对精神知识（？）的这种渴望以外，今天，愈来愈多的学院学生还希望敬仰上帝。”许多学校里的宗教活动蔚为大观。在史坦福大学里，约有两千名学生在复活节早晨起来做晨曦礼拜。参加星期三晚上烛光礼拜的人数，也比十年前增加了几十倍。在密执安大学的两万二千名学生中，几乎有五千人每周至少参加礼拜一次。在伊利诺斯的一个非教会学校怀敦学院里，一千六百名学生除了要做一周六天的早祷之外，还要参加一周五个晚上的晚祷……。
    最引人注目的是哈佛大学。“新闻周刊”说，这个大学在1636年成立时，曾经确定它的宗旨是“促进学识而永远传之于后代”。在这以后的两百年中，哈佛大学更越来越“脱离空想的宗教而独立”，1816年创办的神学院一直“不起作用和受人忽视”。但是，最近几年来，这个宗教色彩较少的哈佛大学，却也成为神学教育和宗教活动的一个中心了。虽然神学院的基金已经增加几倍，但是本学年还是有一百多名想进神学院的新生，由于学校容纳不下而被拒于大门之外。
    就像需要一个暖水瓶一样
    究竟是什么力量引导美国大学生们这样狂热地向往宗教呢？难道他们每个人都是虔诚的教徒吗？“新闻周刊”写道：“这不是说 ……今天学院里的每个年青人，都是十分虔诚的。他们中许多人远不是如此。纽约城的田普勒顿牧师曾经主持过许多年青人的奋兴会，他认为许多学院学生‘似乎祈求上帝就像你在晚上想要一个热水瓶以解除一个暂时的不舒服一样’。”
    作为一个牧师，田普勒顿当然不会嘲笑宗教，而且他甚至也不是嘲笑这些大学生。他的这一段话只是肯定一个事实，那就是：这些大学生对于宗教的狂热，是不能仅仅由宗教本身来加以解释的。
    什么是暖水瓶？那不过是在一个人口渴的时候具有使用价值的东西；而在这些大学生看来，宗教也正是这样。因此，与其说他们“信仰”宗教，还不如说他们“需要”宗教，需要它来解除精神上的某种“不舒服”。
    一种强烈的空虚感
    华盛顿大学宗教教授西卓也承认：“促成这个运动的是一种强烈的空虚感，是对他们自己也不知道的某种东西的追求。”他谈到，“不久以前，有一个学生对我说，‘如果不知道球门在什么地方，那么踢球会有什么意义呢？’”
    的确，如果不知道生活的目标是什么，那么生活又会有什么意义呢？可怕的空虚！这就是许多美国大学生的精神状况。正是在这种“精神真空”之中，宗教就成了某些人的答案。哈佛大学的一个学生说：“除了宗教以外，似乎没有别的答案。我们这一代是追求信仰的一代，学生们要求知道，除了得坏分数以外，生活还有什么意义。我认为一个人必须相信上帝……。”
    他们要把青年们引向何处？
    从这个所谓“宗教复兴”的灰色的图景中，我们看到了许多美国青年是如何苦闷、彷徨和暮气沉沉。他们找不到生活的出路，看不到美好的未来。在他们还没有真正踏上社会生活的时候，就已经感到了社会上的种种威胁。于是，在许多大学生的思想里，出现了令人吃惊的简单的生活公式：在学校里，只希望得到好分数。在社会上，只希望找个好职业。如果感到精神上有某种不舒服，那就到宗教中去寻求解脱。他们是自由的吗？是自由的！他们是自由地不思想，自由地放弃真正生活的权利，自由地把自己的青春活力像一支无用的蜡烛那样消磨掉。于是，宗教是“复兴”了，然而新生的一代却萎谢了；神是被信仰了，然而真正的人的精神却消沉了。
    但是，我们也不能把美国大学里的“宗教复兴”看成是完全自发的。正如“新闻周刊”所报道的，这个“宗教复兴”是有一些像哈佛大学校长普伊西之类的人物来领导的。美国统治阶级和它的教育当局，为了适应垄断资本的需要，总是希望青年们看不见社会和政治问题，甚至根本忘掉现实生活，而变成昏昏欲睡的、与世无争的人。这样，垄断资本集团就可以称心如意地用他们的意志来填补青年们的“精神真空”了。他们要把青年们引向何处呢？据普伊西说，似乎要把他们引向“进步的边缘”，但是，我们不需要加以探求，就可以断定这是十足的讽刺。实际上他们不过是想用神的名义，用精神的鞭子，来驱使青年一代为他们的最大利润的“天堂”服务而已。
