　　Crocodiles of Xishuangbanna

    Many years ago, there was a little princess named Nan Wenka. One night, a fierce wind extinguished the candles burning in the palace, and lightning and thunder shook the earth. The palace maids, one by one, hid in the curtains in fear. Little Nan Wenka woke up from her dream, unable to find a maid to serve her, and cried out in panic, crying for ninety-nine days, causing ninety-nine days of heavy rain on the earth. At this time, a young girl came, hanging her head and kneeling under the king's treasure hall, and said in a low voice: "O King, I have a way to make the princess laugh." The king brought her to Nan Wenka. She sang many songs to Nan Wenka. But even when her throat was hoarse from singing, Nan Wenka still did not stop crying. Then she picked up a cucumber from the fruit plate to quench her thirst. When her hand touched the cucumber, Nan Wenka suddenly stopped crying. She happily used lentils to make a tail for the cucumber and lima beans to make four legs. When she put this finished creature to Nan Wenka's lips for her to kiss, Nan Wenka's last tear fell on this creature, and the creature moved, came to life, and Nan Wenka laughed loudly. From then on, Nan Wenka held it, called it "Da Que," laughing and playing. But soon it relied on the princess's power and kept biting the palace maids with its blunt mouth. One day, when Nan Wenka fell asleep, the palace maids nailed its mouth shut with many nails and threw this annoying monster into the Lancang River....

    This is a story about crocodiles passed down by the Dai people of Xishuangbanna. Now, the crocodiles in the Lancang River not only really look like a "scabby cucumber," but also have jagged, saw-tooth-shaped sharp teeth, much like the wooden nails commonly used by the Dai people.

    "Crocodile" is called "Da Que" in the Dai language. Every year, except for November, December, January and February when crocodiles hibernate and are hard to find, it roams the shallows of the Lancang River throughout the hot summer. Although this fellow is only seven or eight feet long, it often swallows up fifty or sixty pounds of fat pigs and flocks of sheep from the villages, and people bathing in the river are no exception to being chased by this fellow. When the crocodile crawls to the shallows, it is not as active and menacing as it is in the water; instead, it is dull and clumsy. Especially after swallowing pigs and sheep, it always closes its eyes in a daze, buries its body in the water, and sticks its head out on the beach to bask in the sun, sleeping for three or four days. Therefore, the Han people who live here call it "Lazy Dragon," and the Dai people often follow its crawling tracks to kill it. In Yunjinghong (the capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture), people often buy this crocodile meat to cook and eat. It is said that crocodile meat is delicious, tender and palatable.

    The crocodiles produced in Xishuangbanna are generally seven or eight feet long, and the thickest are as thick as a small bucket. Its flat, long, blood-basin-like mouth and the "armor nails" nailed all over its body like those on ancient "city gates" are particularly striking. On both sides of its forehead, there are two semi-circular, egg-sized eyes and four clumsy short legs, with five blunt claws on the short legs, much like turtle claws. The body gradually flattens from the hind legs down, forming a sword-like tail, which it uses to sway and row in the water.

    Although the crocodiles produced in Xishuangbanna are not as large as the giant "saltwater crocodiles" produced in Southeast Asia, they are three or four times larger than the "Yangtze alligators" produced in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Xishuangbanna crocodile has another characteristic, that is, it has longer lips. Generally, a crocodile that is seven feet long often has a mouth that is about one foot long. This kind of crocodile is also rarely seen in other regions of our country. However, judging from its longer lips and its origin close to India and Burma, this crocodile may be similar to the "gharial" produced in India. The distribution of crocodiles in the Xishuangbanna area is also relatively narrow. They are found in the Lancang River area of about 6,000 feet in Yunjinghong, Xuanweishi, Ganlanba, Jingha, and Guanmu, but have not been found in other areas. It is said that crocodiles have a very long lifespan, but there is no definite evidence. According to the Dai people, the lifespan of "Da Que" is three or four times longer than that of elephants, so there is also a saying in the village that eating "Da Que" meat can prolong life.

　　西双版纳的鳄鱼
　　陈贵培
    很多年以前，有一个名叫南温卡的小公主。有一天夜里，狂风吹熄了宫庭里烧点的蜡条，闪电和雷声震撼着大地，宫女们一个个吓得躲到帷帐里。小南温卡从梦里惊醒过来，找不到一个侍候的宫女，就惊惶地哭叫起来，一直哭了九十九天，使大地上落了九十九天的大雨。这时候，来了一个少女垂着头跪在王的宝殿下，低声地说：“王呀，我有办法使公主感到欢笑。”王便把她带到南温卡面前。她对南温卡唱了许多歌。但当她的喉咙唱得已经沙哑的时候，南温卡仍然没有停止哭。这时她顺手在果盘里拿起一条黄瓜来解渴。当她的手拿到黄瓜的时候，南温卡突然不哭了。她就高兴地用扁豆给黄瓜做成一条尾巴，用毛豆做四支脚。她把做好的这家伙放到南温卡嘴边让她亲吻的时候，南温卡的最后一滴眼泪便落在这家伙身上，这家伙便动了起来，有了生命，南温卡也就大笑起来了。从此南温卡便抱着它，叫它“打缺”，笑着玩着。但不久它仗着公主的势，不断地用钝嘴来咬伤宫女。一天当南温卡睡着了，宫女们便用许多钉子钉住了它的嘴巴，把这个讨厌的怪物扔到澜沧江里去了……。
    这是西双版纳傣族人流传的一个关于鳄鱼的故事。现在澜沧江里的鳄鱼除了真的像一条“癞黄瓜”外，还有那参差不齐锯齿形的尖齿，也很像傣族人常用的木钉。
    “鳄鱼”在傣语里叫“打缺”。每年除了11、12月和1、2月鳄鱼冬眠时期找不到它外，其他整个炎热的夏季，它都横行在澜沧江的浅滩上。这个家伙虽然只有七、八尺长，但常常吞食掉村寨里的五、六十斤的肥猪和羊群，在江里洗澡的人们，也不例外的遭到这家伙的追逐。鳄鱼爬行到浅滩来的时候，便不像在水里那样活跃、张牙舞爪了，而是呆头笨脑地；特别是当它吞食下猪羊后，总是死迷洋眼地闭上眼睛，把身子埋在水里，头伸在滩上晒太阳，一睡就是三、四天。所以住在这里的汉族称它为“懒龙”，傣族人常沿着它爬行的足迹，来扑杀它。在允景洪（西双版纳傣族自治州的首府），常有人买这种鳄肉煮来吃。据说鳄肉味道鲜美，细嫩可口。
    西双版纳产的鳄鱼，一般有七、八尺长，最粗的有小桶粗。它那扁长的血盆大口和满身上下像古代“城门”上钉着的
  “甲钉”，特别引人注意。在它的前额左右两端还冒着两个半圆形像鸡蛋般大的眼睛和四只笨拙的短脚，短脚上有着五个钝爪趾，很像龟爪。后足以下的身体，逐渐扁平，形成像宝剑般的尾，靠着这条尾它在水里摇摆、划行。
    西双版纳产的鳄鱼，体积虽然没有南洋产巨型“湾鳄”那么大，但比长江下游产的“扬子鳄”要大三、四倍。西双版纳的鳄鱼有另外的一个特征，就是嘴唇较长，一般身长七尺的，嘴往往长达一尺左右。这种鳄鱼，在我国其他地区也很少见。但从它嘴唇较长的特征和从产地接近印缅看来，这种鳄鱼可能与印度产的“长吻鳄”相接近。鳄鱼在西双版纳地区的分布，也是比较狭窄的，除允景洪，宣慰亍，橄榄坝，景哈，关木等地约六千多尺的澜沧江面外，其他地区没有发现。鳄鱼的寿命据说相当长，但没有确实考据。据傣族说法：“打缺”寿命比象长三、四倍，所以村子里还有吃了“打缺”的肉可以延年益寿的说法。
