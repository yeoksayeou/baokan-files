    Raping Women, Assaulting People Without Reason
    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th, Berlin (TASS dispatch, June 4th): News from West Germany proves that American soldiers, knowing they will not be punished, continue to run rampant, crudely violating the rights of West German residents.
    On June 1st, a tram conductor in Nuremberg was beaten severely by American soldiers after refusing to accept U.S. currency for tram tickets. The Americans tried to hide, but were caught by pedestrians and handed over to the military police.
    In the suburbs of Holsbroga (Bavaria), two American soldiers attempted to rape a German girl. After escaping from the American soldiers chasing her, the girl asked a railway guard for protection. When the guard tried to call the train station to report the incident, the American soldiers broke into the guard's cabin and began their act of outrage.
