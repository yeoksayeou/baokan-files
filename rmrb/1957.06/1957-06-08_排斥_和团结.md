    “Rejection” and Unity
    Liu Jia
    "China is the China of six hundred million people, including counter-revolutionaries, not the China of the Communist Party. It is good for party members to have a sense of ownership, but you are not allowed to think 'L'état, c'est moi.' You should not reject others just because you are the masters..." (Speech by Ge Peiqi, lecturer at the Renmin University of China, see People's Daily, May 31).
    It is easy to understand and correct to say that China is the China of six hundred million people and that party members should not reject others simply because they are the masters. But, to say that counter-revolutionaries are also included in the six hundred million people, that counter-revolutionaries are also masters of China, that Communist Party members cannot even reject counter-revolutionaries, is this the kind of thing that a master of the country would say? Since one believes that counter-revolutionaries are also included in the people and should not be rejected, but should be united, one cannot help but think: "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was a mess," "Communist Party members played the role of plainclothes police monitoring the masses," "Killing communists cannot be said to be unpatriotic," "Even without the leadership of the Communist Party, people would not sell out the country," "If the Communist Party dies, China will not die," and so on.
    Everyone knows that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the unity of our people has been unprecedented in its scope, scale, depth, and consolidation. These are all forward developments, which is a good thing. And one of the reasons for these good things is the basic elimination of domestic counter-revolutionaries. Now, to correctly handle contradictions among the people is to further improve the great unity of the people throughout the country. And one of the prerequisites for this unity is to "reject" counter-revolutionaries. Counter-revolutionaries are irreconcilable with the masses of the people. Therefore, to achieve unity within the people, it is necessary to "reject" counter-revolutionaries. To ask the Communist Party not to "reject" counter-revolutionaries is to ask it to leave the people and unite with counter-revolutionaries, like asking a fish to leave the water and throw itself into the fire. This is impossible. As long as resolute counter-revolutionary elements exist, they must be "rejected." In my opinion, the position that includes counter-revolutionaries in the six hundred million people is the deep "ditch" and thick "wall" separating Ge Peiqi and the like from the Communist Party and the masses of the people. If Ge Peiqi and the like do not change their positions, it will be impossible to fill and level this "ditch" and "wall" only by the Communist Party members and the masses of the people.
    Of course, it is good that Mr. Ge frankly spoke his inner thoughts. I do not "reject" all of what he said. Some of it objectively plays the role of unpalatable but sincere advice, and it is a sincere warning to Communist Party members. This part should be welcomed and used to prompt deep thinking; some of it is just venting dissatisfaction, just angry words, which should be understood, and the reasons for this dissatisfaction should be further explored and eliminated where possible; but some views that do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and that reverse right and wrong must be negated or "rejected." The purpose of this "rejection" is also to strengthen the unity within the people. Without the necessary "rejection," there will be no necessary unity.

### “排斥”和团结

    “排斥”和团结
    刘甲
    “中国是六亿人民的中国，包括反革命在内，不是共产党的中国。党员有主人翁的态度是好的，但是，你们认为‘朕即国家’是不容许的。你们不应因自己是主人翁而排斥别人……。”（中国人民大学讲师葛佩琦发言，见5月31日人民日报。）
    说中国是六亿人民的中国，说党员不应因自己是主人翁就排斥别人，这都容易理解，也都对。但是，说反革命也包括在六亿人民之中，说反革命也是中国的主人，说共产党员连反革命也不能排斥，难道这也像是一个国家主人翁说出来的话吗？既然认为反革命也包括在人民之中，不能排斥，要加以团结，自然就不能不认为：“肃反运动搞糟了”、“共产党员起了监视群众的便衣警察的作用”、“杀共产党人这不能说不爱国”、“不要共产党领导，人家也不会卖国”、“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”等等。
    谁都知道，在中华人民共和国成立以后，我国人民内部的团结，其范围之广，规模之大，基础之深厚和巩固，都是空前的。这些都是前进的发展，是好事。而这些好事的成因之一，就是基本上肃清了国内的反革命。现在要正确处理人民内部的矛盾，是为了更进一步搞好全国人民的大团结。而这种团结的前提条件之一，是要“排斥”反革命。反革命同人民大众誓不两立。因此，要取得人民内部的团结，就要“排斥”反革命。要共产党不“排斥”反革命，就是要它离开人民去同反革命讲团结，如同要鱼离开水，投身向火。这是不可能的。只要坚决的反革命分子存在一天，就要“排斥”它一天。据我看，把反革命也包括在六亿人民之中的立场观点，就是隔在葛佩琦和葛佩琦之流同共产党和人民大众之间的深“沟”和厚“墙”。这种“沟”和“墙”，如果葛佩琦之流不改变自己的立场，只由共产党员和人民大众来填、来拆，是无法填满和拆平的。
    自然，葛先生坦率地讲出了自己的内心话，那是好的。对他所讲的话，我也并不全部“排斥”。其中有些在客观上具有逆耳忠言的作用，不失之为给共产党员的一种忠告。对这部分应该欢迎，并借以引起深思；有些只是发泄胸中的不满，是些气话，对这应该谅解，并进一步去探讨引起这些不满的原因，在可能的条件下，加以消除；而只是对一些不分敌我颠倒是非的观点，却非加以否定，或者“排斥”不可。这“排斥”的目的，也是为了加强人民内部的团结。没有必要的“排斥”，也就不会有必要的团结。
