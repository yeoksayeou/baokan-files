On the issue of the scale of industrial enterprise construction, the Party's policy is: the construction of large enterprises should be combined with the construction of medium and small enterprises; we must not only strive to build large industrial enterprises that play a key role, but also plan to build new and renovate medium and small industrial enterprises suitable for smaller-scale operations. This is a policy that the Party's Eighth National Congress has long established.

During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, it was absolutely necessary for us to build a batch of large-scale, modern, large enterprises centered on the 156 projects with Soviet assistance. This is the foundation of our country's industrialization, and the foundation of our country's machinery industry, transportation industry, and agricultural technological transformation. It is precisely because of this foundation that we can talk about combining large enterprises with medium and small enterprises, and that we should build more medium and small enterprises in the future. However, in the practice of industrial construction, there is still a tendency, even to this day, to inappropriately pursue large scale and grand scenes, and to be unwilling or not actively building medium and small industrial enterprises. Some departments even squeeze out medium and small industrial enterprises after building large industrial enterprises. This approach is obviously incorrect.

As mentioned earlier, during the first five-year plan period for the development of the national economy in our country, in order to improve our country's industrial production level and technical level, and to lay the foundation for our country's industrialization, we are concentrating our efforts on building a number of modern large-scale industrial enterprises. Moreover, for the same purpose, we will continue to strive to build the necessary number of modern large-scale industrial enterprises in the future. This is absolutely necessary and correct. Because this type of enterprise is the backbone of our country's socialist industrialization, it is the material basis for implementing technological transformation of our country's national economy and thus promoting its overall high tide.

Of course, the development of large industrial enterprises and the development of medium and small industrial enterprises are mutually coordinated, mutually promoted and mutually complementary. If only medium and small industrial enterprises are developed, and large industrial enterprises are not developed, then it is fundamentally impossible to realize socialist industrialization, and medium and small industrial enterprises cannot truly develop. However, if only the development of large industrial enterprises is unilaterally emphasized, while the development of medium and small industrial enterprises is ignored or restricted, it will inevitably lead to long-term inability to use investment, very slow industrial growth, uncoordinated overall development of the national economy, inability to promptly and fully utilize the rich resources of various regions, inability to fully exert the enthusiasm of local areas, and inability to meet the diverse needs of people in various regions. This is very harmful. Therefore, when building industrial enterprises, large and small industrial enterprises must be considered as a whole and arranged rationally in order to achieve common development.

Under certain conditions, it is certainly more beneficial to build large industrial enterprises. Because large industrial enterprises are convenient for adopting new technologies, for implementing specialized production, and for improving technical levels, thus its labor productivity may be higher, and the cost of its products may be lower. At the same time, it can also manufacture large-scale equipment and materials, and can carry out mass production. However, this cannot be generalized, but should be comprehensively studied based on conditions such as resources, needs, equipment supply, transportation, and the possibility of investment, as well as the size of the profit rate calculated according to capital, in order to correctly determine whether it is more economically reasonable to build large or small industrial enterprises. Otherwise, blindly pursuing large scale and grand scenes in the construction of industrial enterprises will instead create uneconomical and unreasonable phenomena.

From the current reality of our country's economic backwardness, large population and little land, large proportion of agriculture, low living standards of the people, and unbalanced economic development, there are many advantages to building medium and small industrial enterprises. First, building medium and small industrial enterprises requires less investment, is easy to build, and yields quick results, which can not only relatively quickly meet the needs of the country and the people, but also quickly accumulate construction funds. Second, building medium and small industrial enterprises can make industrial production closer to the source of raw materials and consumption areas. In this way, the distribution of productive forces is more reasonable, economic development can be gradually balanced, and it is also suitable for the requirements of national defense security. Third, building medium and small industrial enterprises can diversify products to meet more needs. Fourth, building medium and small industrial enterprises, especially building more small coal mines, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, small non-metal mines, small power stations, etc. based on resource conditions, can not only overcome the shortcomings of our country's raw material industries, especially the metallurgical industry, fuel industry, chemical industry, and power industry lagging behind the needs of our country's expanded reproduction in a relatively short period of time, but also can expand the number of social employment and better exert the favorable conditions of our country's abundant human resources. Fifth, the design and technical equipment of medium and small industrial enterprises can basically be solved by our country itself. In this way, not only can the potential strength of domestic design and machinery manufacturing be fully utilized, but also the growth of our country's design strength and manufacturing strength can be promoted more rapidly.

Now, let us give some examples to illustrate this problem. For example, before 1956, the Ministry of Coal Industry had built a total of 101 coal mines, of which 32 had a production capacity of less than 300,000 tons per year, 37 had a production capacity of 300,000 to 450,000 tons, and 32 had a production capacity of more than 600,000 tons. The average scale of the wells was 432,000 tons. According to the statistics of existing construction units, the scale of the wells is the smallest for local small coal mines, generally producing several thousand to 10,000 tons per year, and the average investment per ton of production capacity is 3 yuan; while for coal mines with an annual output of less than 150,000 tons, the average investment per ton of production capacity is 12.8 yuan; for coal mines with an annual output of 150,000 tons, the average investment per ton of production capacity is 20.9 yuan; for coal mines with an annual output of 300,000 tons, the average investment per ton of production capacity is 27.5 yuan; and for coal mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons, the average investment per ton of production capacity is 49.1 yuan. As for production costs, medium and small mines are also lower than large mines. According to the investigation of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, the average production cost of coal per ton is 12 yuan for large mines, 9 yuan for medium mines, and only 5 yuan for small mines. It should also be pointed out here that small coal mines can be put into production in the same year they are built; while medium-sized coal mines need one or two years to be put into production, and four years to reach the designed production capacity; as for building coal mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons, it takes three and a half to four years to start production, and seven or eight years to reach the designed production capacity. Moreover, many of the equipment for large coal mines need to be imported, but the equipment needed for medium and small coal mines can all be manufactured domestically. This can not only save investment, but also save foreign exchange. At the same time, if the scale of the coal mine is large, the distance between the coal production site and the sales site will be lengthened, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity and an increase in the selling price, which is not only detrimental to the country, but also to consumers.

The situation similar to the one mentioned above exists not only in the coal industry, but also in other industrial sectors; it exists not only in the industrial sector, but also in the construction undertakings of other economic and cultural and educational sectors. Are many people now not obsessed with large scale and grand scenes, and only look up to large stores, large banks, large schools, large hospitals, large theaters, large hotels, and large auditoriums, and look down on small ones? In fact, pursuing large scale and grand scenes in non-productive construction is even more uneconomical and unreasonable. Among these large non-productive buildings that have been built, except for a very few that are necessary, most are unnecessary or unsuitable. This approach not only wastes the country's construction funds, but also alienates the masses. Therefore, it also needs to be corrected.

With the development of our country's industrialization, we will undoubtedly build many large industrial enterprises that we need in the future. However, it must be seen that the development of large industrial enterprises must be closely combined with the development of small and medium-sized industrial enterprises in order to give full play to its role. Especially under the condition that our country has already built a number of necessary large industrial enterprises, more attention should be paid to the construction of small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. Therefore, when carrying out industrial construction in the future, we should actively develop those medium and small industrial enterprises that play a supporting role or are suitable for smaller-scale operations, especially to build small coal mines, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, small non-metal mines, and small power stations in a more leadership-oriented and organized manner, which is an important measure to overcome the backwardness of our country's raw material industry and expand the number of social employment. To this end, when determining the investment in industrial capital construction, the proportion of investment in medium and small industrial enterprises should be appropriately increased, especially the proportion of investment in local industries. In addition, the construction of new industrial enterprises should be closely combined with existing industrial enterprises, handicrafts and agriculture, so as to save investment, promote each other's development, and rapidly increase production.

　　多建中小型企业
    在工业企业建设的规模问题上，党的方针是：大型企业的建设要同中、小型企业的建设相结合；既要努力建设那些起骨干作用的大型工业企业，又要有计划地新建和改建那些适合于较小规模经营的中、小型工业企业。这是党的第八次全国代表大会早已确定的方针。
    在执行第一个五年计划期间，我们在苏联帮助下建设了以一百五十六项为中心的一批大规模现代化的大型企业，这是完全必要的。这是我国工业化的基础，是我国机械工业、交通运输业以及农业技术改造的基础。正因为有了这个基础，我们才可以谈大型企业与中、小型企业相结合，而且以后要多建设一些中、小型企业。但是，在工业建设的实践中，直至现在还有一种不适当地追求大规模、大场面，而不愿意或者不积极建设中、小型工业企业的偏向。有些部门甚至在建设了大型的工业企业之后，就排挤中、小型工业企业。这种做法，显然是不正确的。
    如前所述，在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，为了提高我国的工业生产水平和技术水平，奠定我国工业化的基础，我们正在集中力量建设着一批近代化的大型的工业企业。而且为了同样的目的，今后我们仍将努力建设必要数量的近代化的大型的工业企业。这是完全必要的和正确的。因为这种企业是我国社会主义工业化的骨干，是对我国国民经济实行技术改造从而促进它的全面高涨的物质基础。
    当然，大型工业企业的发展同中小型工业企业的发展是相互配合、相互促进和相互补充的。如果只发展中、小型工业企业，而不发展大型工业企业，那就根本不可能实现社会主义工业化，而且中小型工业企业也不可能真正发展起来。但是如果只是片面地强调发展大型工业企业，而忽略或者限制中小型工业企业的发展，就势必造成投资长期不能动用，工业增长速度很慢，国民经济的全面发展失调，各地的丰富资源得不到及时的充分的利用，地方的积极性也得不到充分的发挥，各地人民多种多样的需要也得不到满足。这是很有害的。因此，在建设工业企业的时候，对于大型的和中小型的工业企业，必须统筹兼顾，合理安排，以求得共同发展。
    在一定的条件之下，建设大型的工业企业当然是比较有利的。因为大型工业企业便于采用新的技术，便于实行专业化的生产，便于提高技术水平，因而它的劳动生产率可能高一些，它的产品的成本也可能低一些。同时，它还能够制造大型的设备和器材，并且能够大量地进行生产。但是，这也不能一概而论，而应当根据资源、需要、设备供应、交通运输和投资的可能以及按资金计算的利润率的大小等等条件，综合地加以研究，才能正确地规定究竟是建设大型的或者是中小型的工业企业更为经济合理。否则，在工业企业的建设上，盲目追求大规模、大场面，反而会造成不经济不合理的现象。
    从目前我国经济落后、人多地少、农业比重大、人民生活水平低以及经济发展不平衡等现实情况来说，建设中、小型工业企业，有许多优点。第一，建设中小型工业企业，投资少，建设易，收效快，既能比较迅速地满足国家和人民的需要，又能迅速地积累建设资金。第二，建设中、小型工业企业，可以使工业生产更加接近原料产地和消费地区。这样，就使生产力的分布更加合理，经济的发展可以逐步平衡，并且也适合于国防安全的要求。第三，建设中、小型工业企业，可以使产品多样化，以满足更多方面的需要。第四，建设中、小型工业企业，特别是根据资源的条件更多地建设小煤窑、小铁矿、小有色金属矿、小非金属矿、小电站等等，不仅可以在比较短的时期内，克服我国原材料工业特别是冶金工业、燃料工业、化学工业、电力工业落后于我国扩大再生产的需要的弱点，而且可以扩大社会就业的人数，更好地发挥我国人力资源丰富的有利条件。第五，建设中、小型工业企业，工厂的设计和技术设备，基本上可以由我国自行解决。这样，不仅可以充分地发挥国内设计方面和机械制造方面的潜在力量，而且可以更加迅速地促使我国设计力量和制造力量的成长。
    现在，我们举一些例子，来说明这个问题。例如，煤炭工业部在1956年以前，总共建设煤井一百零一处，其中每个煤井每年的生产能力在三十万吨以下的有三十二处，在三十至四十五万吨的有三十七处，在六十万吨以上的有三十二处，井型的规模，平均是四十三万二千吨。而根据现有的建设单位的统计，井型规模以地方的小煤窑为最小，一般年产数千吨至一万吨，每吨生产能力的投资平均是三元；而年产十五万吨以下的煤井，平均每吨生产能力的投资是十二元八角；年产十五万吨的煤井，每吨生产能力的投资平均是二十元九角；年产三十万吨的煤井，每吨生产能力的投资平均是二十七元五角；年产九十万吨的煤井，每吨生产能力的投资平均是四十九元一角。至于生产成本，也是中、小型矿低于大型矿。根据四川省委的调查，每吨煤的生产成本，大型矿平均是十二元，中型矿平均是九元，小型矿平均只有五元。这里还应当指出：建设小的煤井，当年即可投入生产；而建设中型煤井需要一两年才能投入生产，四年才能达到设计的生产能力；至于建设年产九十万吨的煤井，需要三年半到四年才能开始投入生产，到七八年之后才能达到设计的生产能力。而大型煤井的设备，有许多需要依靠进口解决，但是中、小型煤井所需要的设备，却可以全部由国内自己制造。这样不仅可以节约投资，而且还可以节约外汇。同时，煤井的规模大了，煤的产地和销地之间的距离就要拉长，结果就要浪费运输力，提高出售价格，这不仅对国家不利，而且对消费者也不利。
    类似上面所说的情形，不仅在煤炭工业部门存在，在其它工业部门也是存在的；不仅在工业部门存在，在其它经济部门和文教部门的建设事业中也是存在的。目前许多人不是醉心于大规模、大场面，只看得起大商店、大银行、大学校、大医院、大戏院、大旅馆、大礼堂、大办公楼，而看不起小的么？其实，在非生产性建设方面，追求大规模、大场面是更加不经济和不合理的。在已经建成的这些非生产的大型建筑物中，除了极少数是必需的以外，多数是不需要的或者是并不适用的。这种做法，既浪费了国家的建设资金，又脱离了群众。因此，同样需要加以纠正。
    随着我国工业化的发展，我们今后还将建设许多我们所必需的大型的工业企业，这是毫无疑问的。但是必须看到，大型的工业企业的发展必须同中小型的工业企业的发展密切结合，才能充分地发挥它的作用。特别是在我国已经建设了若干必要的大型的工业企业的情况之下，就应该更多地注意中小型的工业企业的建设了。所以，在今后进行工业建设的时候，应当积极地发展那些起配合作用的或者适合于较小规模经营的中、小型工业企业，特别是要更加有领导有组织地建设小煤窑、小铁矿、小有色金属矿、小非金属矿、小电站等，这是克服我国原材料工业落后和扩大社会就业人数的一项重要措施。为此，在确定工业基本建设投资的时候，就要适当地增加对中小型工业企业投资的比重，特别是增加对地方工业投资的比重。此外，对于新的工业企业的建设，要同现有的工业企业、手工业和农业密切结合，以便既能节约投资，又能相互促进发展，迅速增加生产。
