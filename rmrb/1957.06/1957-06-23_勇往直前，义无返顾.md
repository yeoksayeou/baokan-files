　　Advance Bravely, Without Looking Back
　　Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Huang Qixiang
    After reading Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the comrades of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party felt particularly excited. Because we are currently engaged in a struggle against right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, who oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose socialism, and this speech is a powerful weapon for us to wage this struggle against right-wing elements.
    Zhang Bojun's words and deeds are poisonous weeds. In the past, many comrades could not identify them, and some even considered them fragrant flowers. Because they could not recognize them as poisonous weeds, Zhang Bojun spread a lot of toxins within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, leaving behind many erroneous influences. This is certainly a loss for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, but what is even more noteworthy is the serious damage it has caused to the socialist cause.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the supervision of the people of the whole country, we are doing the work of removing poisonous weeds. In order to do this work better and more thoroughly, we must study this speech very seriously and conscientiously. All comrades in the Party must not take this lightly. We must learn from this study the standards for correctly distinguishing between right and wrong and for drawing a clear line between ourselves and right-wing elements in ideology and politics. We must invest ourselves in the battle with a hundredfold confidence and strive for a complete victory in the struggle.
    The struggle against right-wing elements is only the beginning. The Central Executive Bureau has decided to begin a rectification campaign within the Party, mobilizing all comrades in the Party to fight against right-wing elements and unswervingly continue to follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. This struggle is complex and arduous because the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has been influenced by Zhang Bojun's middle-of-the-road line. Today, we cannot say that this influence no longer exists in the minds of some comrades. Do not "hide your illness from the doctor." The process of fighting against right-wing elements is also the process of our self-transformation and self-improvement. We must both acknowledge our own weaknesses and have the confidence and determination to overcome them. On the basis of constantly overcoming weaknesses and constantly making progress, we will coexist with the Communist Party for a long time and make contributions to socialism. Comrades, always follow the Communist Party, advance bravely, without looking back, and overcome any difficulties that may be encountered in the advance of socialist construction.

　　勇往直前，义无返顾
　　中国农工民主党副主席　黄琪翔
    读了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，农工民主党的同志们感到格外兴奋。因为，我们正在与反对党的领导、反社会主义的章伯钧等右派分子进行斗争，而这篇讲演正是我们向右派分子进行斗争的有力武器。
    章伯钧的言行是毒草。在过去，许多同志都不能识别，有些人还甚至认为是香花。因为识别不出是毒草，章伯钧就在农工民主党内散布了不少的毒素，留下了许多错误的影响。这对农工民主党来说固然是一个损失，而更值得注意的是给社会主义事业带来了严重的损害。
    在中国共产党的领导和全国人民的督促下，我们正在做清除毒草的工作。为了把这项工作做得更好更彻底，对这篇讲演就必须进行十分严肃认真的学习。全党同志对此切不可等闲视之，一定要从这一学习里掌握到正确地明辨是非和在思想上政治上与右派分子划清界限的标准，信心百倍地投入战斗，争取斗争的彻底胜利。
    与右派分子的斗争还只是开始。中央执行局已经决定开始在党内整风，动员全党同志与右派分子作战，坚定不移地继续跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。这场斗争是复杂的，艰巨的，因为农工民主党有过章伯钧的中间路线的影响。今天还不能说这种影响在某些同志的脑子里已经不存在。不要“讳疾忌医”。和右派分子作斗争的过程，也就是我们自我改造和自我提高的过程。既要承认我们自己的弱点，也要有克服弱点的信心和决心，在不断克服弱点、不断进步的基础上与共产党长期共存，对社会主义作出贡献，同志们，永远跟着共产党走，勇往直前，义无返顾，克服任何社会主义建设前进中可能碰到的困难。
