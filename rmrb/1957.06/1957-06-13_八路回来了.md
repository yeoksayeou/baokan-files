　　The Eighth Route Army is Back
　　Yongmei, you're back, my child! I remember that February, just after a spring rain, I sent you to the city, along this gurgling stream. My words, my tears, I haven't forgotten them in seven years: "You healed your wounds in that thatched cottage, you washed your bloody clothes in this stream, you shared thin porridge with us, and you divided the land with us during the land reform. When the wild geese fly north, look back south three times; when you go to the city, remember us often. When we encounter difficulties, give us more ideas." During the Dragon Boat Festival, we think of you amidst the sound of gongs and drums during the dragon boat races; during the Mid-Autumn Festival, we think of you when round mooncakes are placed on the table; when the fairy bell flowers bloom on New Year's Day, every family cooks a reunion dinner, thinking of the one who is missing, you! Ah! In that busy city, has your body been overworked? I silently bless you in my heart: may everything go well for you. Who knew that after seven years, you still wouldn't send any news! Life is like a clear sky, sometimes with dark clouds and thunderstorms. When the sun bakes the canals dry and the seedlings wither in the fields, we think of you! When someone's mind is bewitched and they clamor to withdraw from the cooperative, we think of you! When the village cadres are blinded and drive grain-deficient households to jump into wells, and confine young people alive, we think of you! Ah, old Eighth Route Army! Why don't you come back? Don't come back to see our difficulties? Don't come back to listen to our grievances? Don't come back to give me an idea? Child, have you forgotten us! Don't argue! It's because this remote and barren path can't accommodate your car! It's because the leaping cattle and sheep will dirty your new clothes; it's because this small market can't buy convenient meat and fish; it's because this ignorant old woman can't speak pleasing words! How can our thatched cottages and bamboo fences compare to buildings! ... Child! In the quiet of the night, I have wept quietly. How afraid and worried I am! Not afraid that this old person of mine will not live long and will soon die; I am afraid and worried: that "Long Live" and banners will make your eyes and ears dizzy! That documents and briefcases will weigh down your bodies! That you won't be able to build socialism for thousands upon thousands of people! Child, you're back! You're finally back! The old woman almost choked for you, but today she only feels joy upon seeing you. The small house where you used to live, I have cleaned it up, and I will personally steam the salted fish that you like to eat for you. Child, with your personal leadership in running the cooperative, why worry about not building socialism? Look, child: the kapok tree by the roadside, with its branches full of red flowers that bloomed last night, was planted by your own hands, how could it not know of your great joy in returning to the village!

　　八路回来了
　　张永枚回来了，我的孩子！记得那年二月，刚下罢一场春雨，我送你去到城市，沿着这淙淙的小溪。我的话，我的泪，一别七年没忘记：“你在那茅屋里养过伤口，你在这溪水里洗过血衣，和我们一同用稀饭充饥，和我们一同土改分田地。雁北飞，三次回头望南方，进城去，要把我们常想起。当我们遇上困难，你要多多出主意。”端阳节，锣鼓声中赛龙舟，我们想起你；中秋节，团团月饼放桌上，我们想起你；吊钟花开年初一，家家煮好团圆饭，想起少了一个你！啊！在那工作烦忙的城市，可累坏了你的身体？我默默在心里祝福：愿你事事如意。谁知你一去七年，总不捎来消息！生活像晴朗的天空，有时也有乌云雷雨。当太阳烤干了水渠，秧苗瘐在田里，我们想起你！当有人心被鬼迷，吵闹着要退出社去，我们想起你！当村干部昏了两眼，把缺粮户逼去跳井，把年青人活活禁闭，我们想起你！啊，老八路啊！你为什么不回来？不回来看看我们的难处？不回来听听我们的委屈？不回来给我拿个主意？孩子，你是忘了我们了！不要辩解吧！是这穷乡僻野的小路，走不了你的汽车！是那蹦跳的牛羊，会弄脏你的新衣；是这小小的市集，买不到方便的肉鱼；是我这无知无识的老人，讲不出好听的言语！我们这茅屋竹篱，怎能和楼房相比！……孩子啊！在静静的深夜，我曾悄悄哭泣。我多害怕、多耽心呀！不是怕我这暮年的人，活不久就要死去；我害怕、我耽心：万岁和锦旗，使你们眼耳昏迷！文件与皮包，压住了你们的身体！建不成千人万人的社会主义！孩子啊，你回来了！你到底回来了！大娘为你呕过气，今天一见只有欢喜。你从前住的小屋，我已打扫得干净，你喜欢吃的咸鱼，我要亲手蒸给你。孩子啊，有你们亲手领导办社，还愁建不成社会主义？看啊，孩子：路旁那棵木棉树，满树红花开在昨夜里，那是你亲手栽下的呀，怎不知你回村来的大喜！
