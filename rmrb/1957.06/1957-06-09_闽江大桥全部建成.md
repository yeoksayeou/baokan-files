    Minjiang River Bridge Fully Completed
    The key project of the Nanfu Railway – the Minjiang River Bridge – was fully joined on May 18th. From now on, the railway will continue to lay tracks along the east bank of the Minjiang River towards Fuzhou.
    The Minjiang River Bridge is more than 480 meters long, spanning the wide and rapid Minjiang River. The Yang Lian-di Company and brother companies responsible for the construction of this bridge overcame the difficulties brought about by the rainy season and floods, and completed all the bridge erection tasks in just over four months.

    闽江大桥全部建成
    南福铁路的重点工程——闽江大桥，已于5月18日全部合龙。从此，铁路将沿着闽江东岸继续向福州方向铺轨。
    闽江大桥全长四百八十余公尺，横跨宽阔湍急的闽江。负责这座桥梁修建任务的杨连第连和兄弟连队，战胜了雨季和洪水所带来的困难，短短的四个多月时间完成了全部架梁任务。
