　　"Eagle of the Forest"
　　By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong
    In the vast primeval forests of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, May is a beautiful season of singing birds and fragrant flowers, but it is also the time when dry "southerly winds" (cyclones blowing from Lake Baikal in Siberia) frequently occur, making it the most prone to fires.
    Mentioning forest fires is truly a terrifying thing! A single fire can burn tens of hectares, hundreds of hectares, or even thousands of hectares. Before liberation, how much valuable timber was reduced to ashes. In the years since liberation, the Party organizations and the people's government near the forest areas have done a lot of work on forest protection and fire prevention. In the spring of 1952, the state, based on the advanced Soviet experience in forest protection, sent aircraft to participate in forest protection and fire prevention work. Since then, the situation has undergone a major change. Using aircraft for forest protection can not only detect fire situations accurately and promptly, and quickly notify ground fire extinguishing, but also transmit orders for the fire prevention command organization, and quickly notify various places to organize manpower support. Now, Heilongjiang Province divides the forest into three zones, and three aircraft take off every day from Harbin, Nenjiang, and Huma respectively, patrolling within the designated areas, safeguarding the safety of the country's forest resources.
    On May 4th, the weather was clear, and a few wisps of thin clouds floated in the transparent blue sky. I took the forest protection aircraft for the first time, and flew over the Lesser Khingan Mountains for a week from Harbin. The aircraft flew east along the beautiful Songhua River, like a colorful ribbon. There were only three of us on the plane. Sitting in the driver's seat in front were pilots Pan Zuolin and Xu Xueyi; today Xu Xueyi was the pilot on duty. They have both participated in aerial forest protection work in the Northeast region for several years.
    After flying for a while, Comrade Pan Zuolin turned around and told me: "We've arrived at the primeval forest!" I hurriedly looked down at the earth from the window. The undulating mountains with distinct veins, the verdant coniferous pines, the graceful white birches and ash trees, the shimmering streams and lakes, and the sea of forests with its myriad waves stirred by the breeze… It is truly a natural garden!
    I didn't know how the aircraft could detect the slightest traces of fire through this colorful scenery, so I consulted Comrade Pan Zuolin. He told me: "In order to accurately detect traces of fire, we cannot fly as fast as ordinary aircraft during patrol. On the contrary, forest protection aircraft are required to fly as slowly as possible, with a speed of 170 kilometers per hour being the most suitable. In this way, everything on the ground can be seen clearly and accurately; in sunny weather, the 'visibility' is good, and we can see things within 50 kilometers on the left and right." As an old aerial forest protection pilot, he also told me some of the experiences they had initially explored in detecting fire situations. For example, when flying in the air, discovering a plume of smoke rising from the ground into the sky, discovering a hazy layer of fog in the sky with strong winds, smelling the burnt smell of grass and trees in the air, or interference with the aircraft's radio... these are all signs of ground fire. Pilots and observers rely on these experiences to detect fire situations in a timely and accurate manner. Once, when the aircraft was patrolling the Lesser Khingan Mountains, it suddenly discovered a white cloud on a mountain in a dense forest 25 kilometers southeast of Yichun. They circled and patrolled here, and as a result, they saw flames rolling in the dense forest. They immediately dropped fire reports and communication flares to nearby villages and towns, and sent a telegram to the fire prevention command headquarters. The ground firefighting team immediately set out. Overnight, the forest fire here was completely extinguished.
    At this time last year, a raging fire was burning in the primeval forest of the Greater Khingan Mountains near Nenjiang County. Nenjiang County dispatched more than 4,000 people to the scene to fight the fire. Because of the pervasive smoke, strong winds, and multiple fire fronts, after people concentrated their efforts to extinguish one fire, they did not know where the other fire fronts were heading. At this time, the forest protection aircraft, high above, observed clearly and took on the task of command. It dropped the drawn "schematic diagram of fire front directions", and the firefighting team continued to track and fight the fire based on this "diagram". Fighting a large fire sometimes requires the deployment of thousands, or even tens of thousands, of people; because the primeval forest has high mountains and long roads, and transportation is difficult, most of the firefighters ride horses; and the fire often has to be fought for ten or fifteen days. During this period, the forest protection aircraft is also responsible for supplying food, fodder, and other necessary supplies.
    The Heilongjiang Province Forest Fire Prevention Command is preparing to gradually increase air stations and aircraft in the Heilongjiang Province forest area, increase the density of patrol routes, train parachute firefighting personnel, equip new-style firefighting tools and chemical fire extinguishing agents, etc., in order to better protect the country's valuable forest resources.

　　“森林之鹰”
　　本报记者　康伟中
    在辽阔的大小兴安岭原始森林里，5月，正是鸟语花香的美好季节，但是也正是干燥的“南大风”（从西伯利亚贝加尔湖上空吹来的“气旋”）频繁吹来，最易发生火灾的日子。
    提起森林着火，那可真是骇人的事情啊！一烧就是数十公顷，数百公顷，甚至数千公顷。解放以前，有多少宝贵的木材被付之一炬。解放以后这几年，林区附近的党组织和人民政府对护林防火作了许多工作。1952年春天，国家根据苏联先进的护林经验，派飞机参加了护林防火工作。从此，情况有了更大的转变。利用飞机护林，不仅可以及时准确地发现火情，迅速通知地面灭火，而且可以为防火指挥机构传递命令，迅速通知各地组织人力支援。现在，黑龙江省把森林划成三个区，每天有三架飞机分别从哈尔滨、嫩江、呼玛三地起飞，到规定的区域内进行巡逻，捍卫着祖国森林资源的安全。
    5月4日，天气晴朗，透明的蓝天上飘浮着几丝薄云。我第一次乘坐着护林飞机，从哈尔滨到小兴安岭上空航行了一周。飞机沿着美丽如彩带的松花江向东飞去。飞机上只有我们三个人。坐在前面司机台上的是驾驶员潘作霖和许学仪；今天是许学仪担任驾驶。他们两个人参加东北地区的航空护林工作已经有好几年了。
    飞行了不久，潘作霖同志就回过头来告诉我：“原始森林到了！”我急忙凭窗俯瞰大地。那高低起伏、脉络分明的群山，那翠绿的针叶松，那婀娜的白桦和水曲柳，那闪着微光的涧溪和湖泊，那轻风过处，波涛万顷的林海……这真是一座天然的大花园啊！
    我不知道，飞机如何透过这五光十色的景物去发现那点滴的火迹，我请教了潘作霖同志。他告诉我：“为了准确地发现火迹，我们在巡逻时不能像一般飞机那样要求飞得快，恰恰相反，护林飞机要求飞得越慢越好，每小时保持一百七十公里的速度最为适宜。这样，地面上一切东西都能看得清，看得准；遇到晴天，‘能见度’好，可以看到左右五十公里以内的东西。”作为一位老航空护林驾驶员，他还告诉了我一些他们初步摸索出的发现火情的经验。例如，在空中飞行时发现一股烟雾由地面冲向天空，在风势较大的天空里发现有雾状的霾层，在空中嗅到草木燃烧的焦味，或者飞机上的无线电发生了干扰……这些都是地面着火的征候。飞行员和观察员就是靠着这些经验，及时而准确地发现火情的。有一次，飞机在小兴安岭巡逻的时候，忽然在伊春东南二十五公里密林地方的山头上，发现一朵白云，他们便在这里盘旋巡视，结果看到火苗在密林中翻滚着。他们立即向附近村屯投下火报和通讯弹，并向防火指挥部发出了电报。地面打火队伍立即出动。一夜之间，这里的林火就被全部扑灭了。
    去年这个时候，在嫩江县附近的大兴安岭原始森林里，一场熊熊的大火燃烧着。嫩江县出动了四千多人赶到现场扑打。因为烟雾弥漫，风大火急，火头又多，当人们集中力量扑灭了一股火以后，却不知道别的火头奔向何处了。这时候，护林飞机，居高临下，观察得清清楚楚，就担任起指挥任务。它把画好的“火头方向示意图”投下来，打火队伍就凭着这个“图示”继续追踪扑打。扑打一场大火，有时要出动数千人，甚至数万人；因为原始森林山高路远，交通困难，打火的人大都骑着马；大火又往往要扑打十天半月。在这个期间，护林飞机还要负责供应人食马料和其他的必需物资。
    黑龙江省护林防火指挥部准备在黑龙江省林区逐步增加航空站和飞机，增加巡逻航线的密度，训练跳伞扑火人员，配备新式扑火工具以及化学灭火药剂等，以便使祖国宝贵的森林资源得到更好的保护。
