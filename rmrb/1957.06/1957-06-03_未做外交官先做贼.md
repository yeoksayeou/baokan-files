　　Did Not Become a Diplomat, Became a Thief First
　　Paul Ichireman is a twenty-year-old American youth. The American government thought he was of noble birth and promising, and had planned to send him to Spain as a diplomat in August this year. Not long ago, this future diplomat robbed a flower stall of sixteen dollars and shot and wounded a car driver who was chasing him. When the police asked him why he committed the robbery, he replied, "I needed money in my pocket, so I did it. I panicked and fired." He was therefore imprisoned, and his diplomatic future is temporarily unknown.

    未做外交官先做贼
    保尔·伊希雷曼是一个二十岁的美国青年。美国政府认为他出身高贵，有出息，曾经准备今年8月就派往西班牙做外交官。不久以前，这个未来的外交官在一个卖花亭抢走了十六块美金，并开枪打伤一个追他的汽车司机。当警察问他为什么要行劫时，他回答说：“我口袋里需要钱所以就这样做了。我一着急就开枪了”。他因此被关进了监狱，他的外交前程如何，暂时不得而知。
