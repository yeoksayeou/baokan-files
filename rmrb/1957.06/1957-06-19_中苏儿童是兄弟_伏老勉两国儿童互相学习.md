　　Chinese and Soviet Children are Brothers
　　Old Man Ho Encourages Mutual Learning Between Children of the Two Countries
    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 18th – The Soviet Young Pioneer newspaper "Pravda" published on its first, second and third pages, with considerable space, letters from children in various parts of China to Old Man Ho during his visit to our country, and also published photos of Old Man Ho, Chairman Mao and the children together.
    At the same time, Old Man Ho also wrote a letter to the Soviet children, saying: "We have been to many cities in China, and everywhere Chinese friends welcomed us warmly and sincerely. We received thousands of letters from workers, farmers, university students, People's Liberation Army soldiers, Young Pioneers, and primary and secondary school students. These letters expressed the great Chinese people's love and fraternal feelings for the Soviet people." Old Man Ho said: "The letters from Chinese children are very good and very interesting. These letters reflect the life of the Chinese people building a socialist society under the wise and tested leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a new, free, and vibrant life. The letters clearly reflect the happiness and concerns, hopes and aspirations of the Young Pioneers and primary and secondary school students. The letters from Chinese children are filled with warm and noble feelings of friendship for the Soviet people, for our children." Old Man Ho said: "Chinese Young Pioneers and primary and secondary school students told us that they love Soviet children and call you brothers. I hope that you, young Leninists, will firmly consolidate your friendship with Chinese children, strive to learn more about them, and exchange experiences in studies, sports and arts, in children's organizations and various group activities, and in acquiring labor habits to serve the motherland."
