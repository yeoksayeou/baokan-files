My Experiences with Departmental Adjustment and Teaching Reform
Zhao Chengxin, Professor, Renmin University of China

My relationship with the Party has been generally good and pleasant, but there have also been unfavorable and unpleasant aspects. Here, I will focus on issues related to departmental adjustment and teaching reform for the relevant departments to consider during the rectification campaign.

In mid-December 1948, the entire faculty, students, and staff of Yenching University welcomed liberation with joy. In 1949, as the Dean of the Law School of Yenching University, I was responsible for organizing political theory courses. With the strong support of the Ministry of Education and the comrades of the school's Party branch, the political theory courses were successful. At that time, many teaching systems in the school needed reform, and the Law School's curriculum was even more problematic. Several friends had reflected a lot of information and made many suggestions to the responsible comrades of the school's Party branch at the time, but the secretary of the school's Party branch not only did not give us active support but also said that we were engaged in factional activities. Several of us had directly reported the same situation and made the same suggestions to the Ministry of Education, but Zhang Zonglin, the director of the Ministry of Education, used the metaphor of "generals and ministers in harmony" to advise us during a speech in the Yenching University auditorium. Obviously, the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education were influenced by the opinions of the school's Party branch at the time. Later, the "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers proved that it was not us who were engaged in factional activities.

Departmental adjustment was generally successful, but the Ministry of Higher Education had subjective and other work styles during the adjustment process.

Since liberation, I have actively supported the revolutionary cause led by the Party, and I have put a lot of thought into the reform of teaching systems and curriculum. However, due to my low theoretical level, many ideological problems, and incorrect ideological methods, my health finally collapsed in the fall of 1950. It was not until the "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers that my health began to improve.

The "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers was a great education for me. It not only gave me the opportunity to correct my position, but also fundamentally changed my way of thinking, fundamentally negating the bourgeois metaphysical way of thinking, and initially mastering the dialectical materialist way of thinking. The "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers was generally good, but in the midst of the storm, some older comrades were more or less injured. When talking about the "Three-Anti" during this help-the-Party rectification campaign, some comrades were still very emotional. The Party has not promptly understood their ideological situation and given them help for several years, which must be said to be a shortcoming in the Party's united front work.

Following the "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers was departmental adjustment. In general, departmental adjustment was successful. It concentrated the strengths of various departments and majors scattered in the original universities, which not only facilitated the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education but also facilitated the role of the original teachers. After the departmental adjustment, a series of new courses were opened in political science, law and economics majors. Although the content of these courses has areas for criticism, in general, they meet the requirements of China's socialist construction. However, the Ministry of Higher Education's adjustment work for the original law school was very passive. The more reasonable approach at the time would have been to merge the law schools of several universities in Beijing into Renmin University of China. However, this was not done at the time, and the Central University of Finance and Economics and the Beijing University of Political Science and Law were passively established. Within a year, the Central University of Finance and Economics was finally merged into Renmin University of China.

The entire departmental adjustment process reflected that the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education had serious subjective, bureaucratic, and sectarian work styles. Take the establishment of the Labor Special Training Program as an example. Before the departmental adjustment, during the curriculum reform period, Fu Jen Catholic University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University had established labor professional groups in the original Sociology Department, and later, the labor group was changed to the Labor Department at Yenching University. All of this had been approved by the Ministry of Education (the Ministry of Higher Education had not yet been established at that time). In the early stages of discussions on departmental adjustment, the Ministry of Education suggested establishing a labor professional group in the Economics Department of Peking University. When the Ministry of Education announced the initial plan, it suggested canceling the labor major. The final plan proposed establishing the Central University of Finance and Economics and establishing a Labor Special Training Program within the Central University of Finance and Economics. According to our later understanding, the Ministry of Education's initial plan to cancel the labor major was made without consulting the Ministry of Labor, and the decision was made on its own. Later, when the Ministry of Labor found out, it raised objections, and the Labor Special Training Program was established. The entire process of change was not well discussed with the school's teachers.

During the year at the Central University of Finance and Economics, the comrades of the Labor Special Training Program eagerly looked forward to learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. At that time, we knew nothing except for a teaching plan of the labor economics major of the Moscow Institute of Economics, which was given to us by the Ministry of Higher Education for reference. The opportunity to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union seemed to be coming. At that time, a Director Zhang from the Ministry of Higher Education participated in an education inspection delegation to the Soviet Union to inspect the situation of higher education. The head of the program, through the university leadership, asked the Ministry of Higher Education to have Director Zhang bring back some reference materials for us. However, Director Zhang returned from the inspection, and after we urged the university several times, the final answer was that Director Zhang had gone to Wuhan to take the position of president. Our eager hope to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was thus dashed.

The Labor Special Training Program was already a difficult birth when it was established, but when the Central University of Finance and Economics merged into Renmin University of China, it became like an illegitimate child that no one in feudal society was willing to admit. It is said that after many rejections, Renmin University reluctantly accepted this illegitimate child. Here, the leading comrades of Renmin University should examine what "ism" is at play and find a suitable label to wear, which will be helpful for future work.

In the fall of 1953, the Labor Special Training Program moved to the new site of the original Central University of Finance and Economics. On the surface, the higher-level leaders finally noticed that there was a Labor Special Training Program, but the content of learning Soviet labor economics through Renmin University of China or the Ministry of Higher Education still fell through. This problem was not solved until experts in labor economics came to the cadre school of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, but that was already in the fall of 1954. In the fall of 1955, the Labor Special Training Program was merged into the Central Labor Cadre School. The labor economics major thus left Renmin University of China and began a new page in its life. It cannot be said that it is a great irony that advanced Soviet experience cannot be obtained in Renmin University of China, where advanced Soviet experience is directly learned. This is worth digging into the ideological roots of the school's leading comrades.

It should be pointed out here that in the years of the Labor Special Training Program, several comrades often talked about the development prospects of the labor economics major. We believe that the labor economics major is necessary because, with the industrialization of the country, labor and wage organization issues will become increasingly prominent. At the same time, we also believe that labor economics is a major that is both policy-oriented and technical. Therefore, in order to cultivate talents in this major well, the Ministry of Higher Education should also hire Soviet experts to guide. Unfortunately, our opinions were not valued at that time.

Correctly assess the working ability of older teachers and give full play to their enthusiasm

In early September 1955, the four of us older comrades did not go to the Labor Cadre School, but stayed at Renmin University of China to await the assignment of the Ministry of Higher Education. The director of the school's personnel department told us that we could choose a teaching and research office first and study there. We thanked the school for its kindness at the time, but at first, we did not expect to wait for two months before entering the teaching and research office (Comrade Li Jinghan took half a year off due to illness before entering the teaching and research office.). Although two months is not long, it is not short, and we urged several times in the middle. The question I want to raise here is: Did the school leaders underestimate the working ability and enthusiasm of the older teachers? Do they feel that the older teachers are a burden? Such questions can also be raised to the Ministry of Higher Education: During the departmental adjustment, did the Ministry of Higher Education make a specific analysis of the working ability and enthusiasm of many older teachers in the Law School? If they were very busy at the time, did they have some time to do this analysis work in the following years? If they did not do so, what were the reasons? During the rectification campaign, it would not be bad for the leading comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education to think about these questions.

After Premier Zhou's report on the problem of intellectuals was published, the leadership of Renmin University of China changed its view of older teachers. However, in general, there have been more changes in terms of living conditions, and specific help with the ideology and business of older teachers is still not enough. In general, the older teachers of the original Law School lost a lot of confidence in their business after the "Three-Anti" campaign for teachers. Rebuilding confidence is still a long process, and there must also be a material basis. The comrades of the statistical theory teaching and research office (including Party members and non-Party members) spent more than a year helping and encouraging Comrade Li Jinghan, and then Vice-President Zou added another effort, but it was not until the People's Daily published his investigation and research report that Comrade Li Jinghan really regained his confidence (Comrade Li Jinghan once said that he is still not very confident now.).

We should say that older teachers have potential. Many older teachers understand one or several foreign languages, and it is easier to read foreign books, and many of them also have foreign language writing skills, which cannot but be a huge force for international academic exchanges. In the years since liberation, older teachers have more or less learned new theories, and some have read a lot of Marxist-Leninist classics. In this way, older teachers with both old and new knowledge will have more critical abilities when learning foreign experience than young teachers, which will help young teachers overcome dogmatism. Whether in practical investigation and research work or theoretical analysis and research work, they will be able to play a great role. However, each older teacher has different potential, and detailed analysis and research work is needed here. It is necessary to consult with the older teachers themselves and learn more from the older teachers' friends, because older teachers have lost their confidence, and their views on their potential will be uncertain, and even they will not believe that they still have potential.

It should also be pointed out here that older teachers should not be encouraged too much. If it is done too much, encouragement will become pressure, and older teachers cannot withstand pressure. At the same time, those who have made some achievements should not be praised too much. Excessive praise will make people dizzy, and it will not be easy to progress in the future and it will not be easy to play a greater potential. This is not good for the older teachers themselves and for the country.

Lecturer-level teachers are the main force in the current school teaching. It cannot be said that the school leaders have enough attention to them, and have a clear understanding of their development direction and training prospects. According to the opinions recently reflected, there is serious sectarianism in the school leaders' training and promotion of young teachers. Measures should be taken quickly to overcome these shortcomings in order to benefit the unity between teachers.

Renmin University of China should develop into a multi-disciplinary social science university

In recent years, Renmin University of China has lacked a clear direction for professional development, which cannot but have a negative impact on the training of young teachers. In the future, active discussions should be launched, opinions should be widely solicited, and the direction of development should be decided as soon as possible. Here, I only put forward some immature opinions for the leadership to refer to. I think Renmin University of China should develop into a multi-disciplinary social science university. This social science university should not only have four political theory majors, but also have finance and economics majors. The finance and economics discipline is guided by political theory, and the political theory discipline is linked to practice with the help of the finance and economics discipline. At present, each major has a considerable foundation and has achieved certain results, which is good. However, there is little contact between the teaching and research offices, forming a situation where each does its own thing. Therefore, the university cannot play the role of an organic whole. This work style should be changed as soon as possible. In order to run this university well, the Ministry of Higher Education should transfer part of the books and materials of the original Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Fu Jen Catholic University Law Schools to Renmin University of China.

Vigorously carry out social and economic investigation and research work

In recent years, there has been dogmatism to varying degrees in the teaching of various disciplines. We must conduct in-depth inspections by category. In order to overcome dogmatism, the political theory major should open its doors to non-Party older teachers. This will be good for young teachers to cultivate independent thinking ability and expand the field of knowledge. But more importantly, it is necessary to vigorously carry out social and economic investigation and research work. Consideration can be given to establishing an investigation network in Beijing that includes factories, farms, shops, and construction units. When the time is ripe, consideration can also be given to conducting a large-scale comprehensive survey of Beijing. This will help teachers and students face reality and make friends with workers and peasants. This will make theory linked to practice, and the ideological level of teachers will also be improved.

In order to allow the leading comrades of the teaching and research office to better lead teaching and research work, they should be liberated from the many administrative tasks they are currently engaged in. It is extremely uneconomical and wasteful for the director of the teaching and research office to do administrative work, and it also deprives the leading comrades of the opportunity to improve and advance to science. This is certainly also unreasonable.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have timely put forward the problem of correctly handling contradictions among the people. As long as everyone learns how to analyze contradictions and solve contradictions in the rectification campaign, our problems can be solved and difficulties can be overcome.

### 我对院系调整和教学改革的体会

　　我对院系调整和教学改革的体会
　　中国人民大学教授  赵承信
    我和党的关系总的说是好的、愉快的，但也有不好的、不愉快的一面。这里我着重谈谈院系调整和教学改革方面的问题，供有关方面整风时参考。
    1948年12月中，燕京大学全体师生职工以愉快的心情欢迎了解放。1949年我以燕京大学法学院院长的职位负责组织政治理论课程。因为有了教育部和学校党支部同志的大力支持，政治理论课程是开得有成绩的。当时学校的许多教学制度是需要改革的，法学院的课程就更成问题了。有关这些事情，几位朋友曾给当时学校党支部负责同志反映过不少情况，并提过不少建议，但学校党支部书记不但没有给我们以积极的支持，反而说我们在搞宗派主义活动。我们有几位同志曾直接给教育部汇报过同样情况，提过同样建议，但教育部的张宗麟司长在燕京大学礼堂讲话时则以“将相和”比喻劝导我们一番。显然，教育部负责同志是受了当时学校党支部意见影响的。后来，“三反”教师学习运动时证明搞宗派主义活动的不是我们。
    院系调整总的说是成功的，但调整过程中高教部有过主观主义等作风
    自从解放以来，我对党所领导的革命事业是积极拥护的，而且对教学制度和课程改革是费过一番心思的，但毕竟由于自己理论水平低，思想问题多，思想方法不对头，1950年秋身体终于搞垮了，直至“三反”教师学习时，身体健康才开始好转。
    “三反”教师学习对于我是一次很大的教育，不但有机会端正了立场，而且从此我的思想方法起了很大变化，从根本上否定了资产阶级形而上学的思想方法，初步掌握了辩证唯物主义的思想方法。“三反”教师学习总的说是好的，但在狂风暴雨中，有些年龄较大的同志或多或少是受了伤的。在这次帮助党整风谈起“三反”时，有些同志的情感还是很激动的。几年以来党没有及时了解他们的思想情况，给他们以帮助，不能不说是党统战工作中的一个缺点。
    紧接着“三反”教师学习的是院系调整。总的说，院系调整是成功的。它把分散在原有几个大学的各系和专业的力量集中起来，这不但便于高教部领导，而且更利于发挥原有教师的作用。院系调整后，政法和财经各专业开设了一系列新的课程，这些课程的内容，虽然有可批评的地方，但是一般说来，它们是符合中国社会主义建设要求的。但高教部对原法学院的调整工作是很被动的。当时比较合理的办法应是北京几个大学的法学院并入中国人民大学，但是，当时没有这样作，而是被动地成立了中央财经学院和北京政法学院。不一年，中央财经学院终于并入中国人民大学了。
    整个院系调整过程反映出高教部负责同志有过严重的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的作风。就拿劳动专修科的设立来说吧，在院系调整前课程改革期间，辅仁大学、清华大学和燕京大学在原社会学系里就曾设立过劳动专业组，而且其后在燕京大学里还将劳动组改为劳动系。这一切都曾经过教育部（当时高教部还没成立）批准的。在院系调整商谈的初期，教育部建议在北京大学经济系成立劳动专业组，在教育部宣布初次方案时则建议取消劳动专业，最后方案又提出成立中央财经学院，并在中央财经学院内设立劳动专修科。据我们后来了解，教育部的初次方案建议取消劳动专业，事先是未征求劳动部意见而自作主张的，后来劳动部知道了，提出不同意见，才成立劳动专修科。整个变化过程都没有很好的跟学校教师商量过。
    在中央财经学院的一年，劳动专修科的同志热烈盼望学习苏联先进经验。当时，我们除了高教部发给我们参考的一纸莫斯科经济学院的劳动经济专业教学计划外，什么也不晓得。学习苏联先进经验的机会好像要到来了，高教部那时有位张司长参加一个教育视察团去苏联视察高教情况，当时科主任通过院领导向高教部请张司长给我们带些参考资料来。可是张司长视察回来了，我们通过院方催促几次，最后的答复是张司长到武汉就任校长去了。我们学习苏联先进经验的热望就是这样落了空。
    劳动专修科在它的成立时已是个难产的婴儿，但到中央财经学院合并到中国人民大学时，它更变成了像封建社会里没有人愿意承认的私生子了。听说经过多次的推诿，人民大学才勉强接受了这个私生子的。这里，人民大学领导同志应当检查一下究竟是什么“主义”在作怪，找顶合适的帽子戴上，会对今后工作有好处的。
    1953年秋，劳动专修科搬到原中央财经学院新址。在表面上，上级领导总算注意到有个劳动专修科了，但通过中国人民大学或高教部来学习苏联劳动经济学的内容还是落了空。这个问题直到全国总工会干部学校来了劳动经济学专家之后才解决，但那已是1954年秋天的事了。1955年秋劳动专修科并入中央劳动干部学校。劳动经济专业也就这样离开中国人民大学，在自己的生命中开始了新的一页。在直接学习苏联先进经验的中国人民大学里得不到苏联的先进经验，不能说不是个很大的讽刺，这是值得学校领导同志挖一下思想根源的。
    这里应该指出，在劳动专修科的几年，几位同志经常谈到劳动经济专业的发展前途问题。我们相信劳动经济专业是必需的，因为随着国家工业化，劳动工资组织问题会日愈显露。同时，我们还认为劳动经济是一个既有政策性又有技术性的专业。因此，为着很好地培养这个专业的人才，高教部还应聘请苏联专家来指导。可惜，当时我们的意见没有被重视。
    正确估计老教师的工作能力，发挥老教师的积极性
    1955年9月初，我们四位年龄较大的同志没有去劳动干部学校，而是留在中国人民大学听候高教部分配工作。学校人事处长告诉我们可以先选个教研室，在那里学习。我们当时感谢学校的好意，但初时却没有想到等候了两个月才进教研室的（李景汉同志因病休养了半年才进教研室的。）。两个月的时间虽然不算长，可也并不算短，而且当中还催促过好几次。在这里我想提出的问题是：学校领导对老教师工作能力和工作的积极性是不是有些低估了呢？是不是对老教师有背包袱之感呢？这样的问题也可以给高教部提出：在院系调整的时候，高教部有没有对法学院的许多老教师的工作能力和工作积极性作过具体分析呢？如果当时很忙，其后几年是否有点时间作这种分析工作呢？如果没有这样作，又是为了什么原因呢？在整风时，高教部领导同志想想这些问题不是没有好处的。
    周总理关于知识分子问题报告发表以后，中国人民大学的领导方面对老教师的看法是有了改变的。但是，一般的说，对生活待遇方面的改变多些，对老教师的思想和业务具体帮助还是很不够的。总的说来，原法学院的老教师经过“三反”教师学习后，对自己业务的信心大大丧失了。要重新培养自信心还是一个长期的过程，而且还要有个物质基础。统计理论教研室的几位同志（包括党员与非党员同志）费了一年多的时间来帮助和鼓励李景汉同志，其后邹副校长又添了一把力，但直到人民日报发表了他的调查研究报告后，李景汉同志才真的重新有了自信心（李景汉同志曾说过到现在自信心还不是很足的。）。
    我们应当说，老教师是有潜力的。许多老教师懂得一种或几种外国语，阅读外文书籍比较容易，而且其中不少人还有外文写作能力，这对国际学术交流不能不是一个巨大力量。解放以来几年，老教师或多或少学了新理论，其中还有读了不少马列主义经典著作的。这样，兼有新旧知识的老教师在学习外国经验时就会比青年教师更有批判的能力，这就便于帮助青年教师克服教条主义。无论在实际调查研究工作中或理论分析研究工作中，他们将能发挥很大的作用。但是每个老教师的潜力不同，这里需要作细致的分析研究工作。既要跟老教师本人多商量，又要从老教师的朋友那里多了解，因为老教师既然失掉了自信心，对自己潜力的看法就会摇摆不定的，甚至，会不相信自己还会有潜力的。
    这里还须指出，对老教师不能过分鼓励，做得过分了，鼓励就会变成压力，而对压力老教师是吃不消的。同时，对有了一些成绩的还不能过分表扬，过分表扬会使人冲昏头脑，以后就不易进步，不易发挥更大的潜力。这对老教师本人和对国家都是不利的。
    讲师级的教师是目前学校教学中的主力。不能说学校领导方面对他们有足够的重视，对他们的发展方向、培养前途有确切的认识。根据最近所反映的意见，学校领导对青年教师的培养和提拔存在着严重的宗派主义。对这些缺点应当迅速地采取措施加以克服，以利教师之间的团结。
    中国人民大学应该发展成为一个多科性的社会科学的大学
    几年以来，中国人民大学对专业发展是缺乏明确方向的，这对青年教师的培养不能没有消极的影响。今后应积极的展开讨论，广泛征求意见，早日决定发展方向。这里我仅提出一点不成熟的意见供领导参考。我认为中国人民大学应发展成为一个多科性的社会科学的大学。这个社会科学的大学不仅要有四个政治理论专业，而且还要有财经专业。财经学科是以政治理论为指导的，而政治理论学科则是通过财经学科的帮助来联系实际的。目前各个专业已有相当基础并已取得一定的成绩，这是好的。但各教研室之间很少来往，形成各搞各的，因之，大学就不能发挥有机整体的作用。要及早改变这种作风。为了办好这个大学，高教部应将原北大、清华、燕京、辅仁等法学院图书资料的一部分转交给中国人民大学。
    大力开展社会经济调查研究工作
    几年以来，各学科的教学中存有不同程度的教条主义。我们要分门别类地深入检查。为了克服教条主义，政治理论专业要给非党老教师开门。这对青年教师培养独立思考能力和扩大知识领域会有好处的。但更重要的是要大力开展社会经济调查研究工作。可以考虑在北京市建立包括有工厂、农场、商店、基建单位的调查网。待时机成熟时，还可以考虑对北京市作一次规模较大的综合性调查。这就会帮助教师与学生面向实际，跟工农群众交朋友。这样就会使理论联系实际，而且教师的思想水平还会得到提高。
    为了让教研室领导同志更好地领导教学与研究工作，应使他们从目前许多事务性的工作中解放出来。由教研室主任来做事务性工作是极不合算的，是很浪费的，而且还剥夺领导同志提高和向科学进军的机会。这当然也是不合理的。
    党中央、毛主席及时地提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，只要大家在整风运动中学会分析矛盾、解决矛盾的方法，我们的问题是能够解决的，困难是能够克服的。
