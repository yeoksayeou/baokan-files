　　Reclaiming Over Four Million Mu of Wasteland, Investment Significantly Less Than Last Year
    Carry Forward the Revolutionary Army's Tradition of Hard Struggle, Demobilized Railway Soldiers Run Farms Frugally
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Our newspaper reporter Miao Feng reports: The demobilized officers and soldiers of the Heilongjiang Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau's farms, on the vast grasslands of Mishan, Hulin, Baoqing, Raohe, and other counties, carrying forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of the People's Army, and together with the young people from all over the country who volunteered to reclaim wasteland, have implemented the policy of running farms diligently and frugally in the construction of the farms, and have achieved great results. This year, they plan to reclaim three million mu of virgin wasteland, which, together with the virgin and cultivated land reclaimed last year, will reach more than 4.22 million mu. More than 200,000 mu of wheat, more than 1 million mu of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains have been sown, with a total investment of 80 million yuan. Compared with the state investment of 1 billion yuan last year to reclaim 16 million mu, this year's investment per mu is only about 33% of last year's.
    The production conditions here are not good. Most of the land is wet and swampy and needs to be drained before it can be reclaimed; the climate is bad and the frost-free period is short. Many people have doubts about whether to develop this area. However, the demobilized officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, under the personal leadership and support of Minister Wang Zhen of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, not only completed the spring reclamation and sowing tasks on schedule, but also set an example in saving state investment.
    They changed the past practice of building farms first and then producing, and produced while building. In terms of production, they drained, reclaimed, and sowed simultaneously. Drainage projects were based on the principle of being able to drain surface water and allow tractors to enter, and small drainage channels 50 to 60 cm wide and 30 to 40 cm deep were excavated on a large scale. Compared with "regular" drainage projects, this greatly saved manpower, time, and investment. Reclamation and sowing were determined by the dryness and wetness of the land, reclaiming wherever it was dry first, giving full play to the efficiency of labor and machinery. In terms of the basic construction of the farm headquarters and production teams, the principle was to use local materials, make do with what was available, and build houses with whatever materials were available, as long as they could keep warm in winter. The infrastructure construction team was responsible for the main projects, and some demobilized officers and soldiers and their families also participated in carrying wood, cutting grass, and making mud bricks. This not only did not affect the land reclamation task, but also quickly solved the problem of housing for employees. The employees call the practice of building farms while producing a win-win situation. "Contribute one more point of effort, and the country will save one more penny," and "Sweat one more drop in the summer, and harvest one more grain in the autumn," are the slogans they put forward in the tense summer production labor.
    From the beginning of the farm's construction, the leading cadres learned from the lessons of some old farms that had continuously lost money due to single-product management, and paid attention to diversified operations, especially the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. The farms collectively raise nearly a thousand head of cattle and thousands of pigs. This year, they plan to develop 2,500 sows and 10,000 piglets and fattening pigs, and increase the number of sheep and cattle. In this way, some of the by-products of agricultural crops that can be used as feed are rationally used, and the fertilizer needed for agricultural crop test areas and some vegetable gardens is guaranteed. The employees of the breeding farm near the Mudan River are doing everything possible to increase income for the country. In the chicken farming alone, they plan to hand over a profit of 130,000 yuan this year. In March, they built a small smoked chicken house to smoke small roosters and culled chickens, and have already had a large amount of income. They plan to increase the incubation task of 500,000 chickens and strive to have more profits handed over to the state. In addition, the farms develop fish farming, horticulture, and forestry based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. In afforestation alone, they are preparing to cultivate 1,500 mu of nurseries for valuable timber such as Korean pine and larch.
    The demobilized officers and soldiers are new to running farms and lack experience. There are still some problems in implementing the policy of running farms diligently and frugally. Some farm headquarters have a bureaucratic air, implementing an eight-hour work day and Sunday rest. This is not very suitable for the farm's production situation, especially during the busy farming season. Some problems that can be solved on the same day also take two or three days. Some production units have too many non-production personnel. The phenomenon of individual production teams not cherishing locomotives is very serious, and the production layout is also unreasonable, with tractors often driving empty. All of the above cause invisible waste.
    Recently, the farms have launched a rectification study focusing on "cadres participating in productive labor." After the cadres participated in production, they discovered many problems. Problems belonging to unreasonable administrative management and work systems have been corrected as soon as they are discovered; for problems belonging to lack of experience and technical unfamiliarity, the Land Reclamation Bureau has opened a ten-day training class for machine team leaders and technicians in the wilderness, learning by doing. People who have gone through the study pass on production knowledge to the production teams. (Attached picture)
    This year, the state-owned Huangfan District Farm achieved large-scale bumper harvests of wheat, with an average yield per mu increasing by 6% compared to the plan. The picture shows the Stalinist No. 6 tractor combine harvesting wheat.

　　开荒四百多万亩  投资比去年大减
    发扬革命军人艰苦奋斗传统  铁道兵复员官兵勤俭办农场
    本报讯　本报记者苗风报道：黑龙江省铁道兵农垦局所属各农场的复员官兵，在密山、虎林、宝清、饶河等县的茫茫草原上，发扬了人民军队艰苦奋斗的优良传统，和来自全国各地志愿垦荒的青年一起，在建设农场中，贯彻了勤俭办场的方针，取得了很大成绩。他们今年计划开垦生荒三百万亩，连去年开垦的生、熟荒地，可达四百二十余万亩，已播种小麦二十多万亩，大豆和其它杂粮一百多万亩，共计全部投资八千万元。这和去年国家投资十亿元垦荒一千六百万亩相比，今年每亩投资只等于去年的33％左右。
    这里的生产条件并不好。土地大部分是湿洼地，需经过排水才能开垦；气候条件坏，无霜期短。在是否开发这片地方的问题上，有不少人抱怀疑态度。但人民解放军复员官兵，在农垦部王震部长亲自领导和支持下，不仅按期完成了春季垦荒和播种的任务，而且在节约国家投资方面树立了榜样。
    他们改变了已往建设农场时先建设后生产的作法，一边生产一边建设。在生产方面，边排水，边开垦，边播种。排水工程以能排出地表水，能开进拖拉机为原则，大规模地开凿了宽五六十公分，深三四十公分的小型排水渠道。这和“正规”的排水工程比较，就大大节约了人力、时间和投资。开垦和播种，视地干湿而定，那里先干就先开那里，充分发挥了劳力和机械设备的效能。在场部和各生产队的基本建设方面，以就地取材，因陋就简，有什么材料建什么房屋，能保温过冬为原则。基建大队负责主要工程，一部分复员官兵和家属也参加了扛木料、割草、做泥坯等工作。这样既不影响垦荒任务，又较迅速地解决了职工住房问题。职工们称边生产边建场的作法是一举两得。“自己多出一分力，国家多省一分钱”，“夏季多流一滴汗，秋季多收一粒粮”，这是他们在紧张的夏季生产劳动中提出来的口号。
    一开始建场，领导干部就接受了一些老场由于经营单一化而不断亏本的教训，注意了多种经营，特别是农牧结合。各场共饲养近千头牛，数千头猪。今年计划发展母猪二千五百头，仔猪和肥猪一万头。并增加羊群和牛群。这样，一部分可作饲料的农作物的副产物得到了合理使用，又保证了农作物试验区和一部分菜地所需的肥料。靠近牡丹江的种畜场的职工们，千方百计的为国家增加收入。仅养鸡一项，今年就计划上缴利润十三万元。3月间他们修建了一座小型熏鸡房，熏制小公鸡和淘汰鸡，已有了大批收入。他们计划增加五十万只鸡的孵化任务，争取有更多的利润上缴国家。另外，各场根据因地制宜的原则，发展养鱼、园艺和林业。仅育林一项，即准备培育红松、落叶松等珍贵木材的苗圃一千五百亩。
    复员官兵初办农场，缺乏经验，在贯彻勤俭办场的方针上，还存在一些问题。有的场部摆着一副机关架子，实行八小时工作制和星期日休假制。这和农场生产情况，特别是农忙季节的情况很不适应。有些当天可解决的问题，也要拖两三天。有的生产单位，非生产人员过多。个别生产队不爱护机车的现象很严重，生产布局也不合理，拖拉机开空车的时候很多。以上种种都造成无形的浪费。
    最近各场开展了以“干部参加生产劳动”为主要内容的整风学习。干部参加生产以后，发现了不少问题。属于行政管理、工作制度不合理部分，已随时发现随时改正；属于经验不足和技术不熟练方面的问题，农垦局在荒原上开办了机务队长、技术员十日训练班，边做边学。通过学习过的人，把生产知识传授给各生产队。（附图片）
