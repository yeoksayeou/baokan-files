　　Don't Just Pursue Large Reservoirs and Neglect Flood Control and Drainage
　　Lu Qin'kan, Chief Professional Engineer, Design Institute of the General Hydropower Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry
    In the planning work for the Yangtze River Basin, flood control has been proposed as the primary task. However, there are still differing views on how to reasonably solve the Yangtze River's flood control problem. How should this contradiction be resolved? Based on my experience participating in the Yangtze River planning work for more than a year, I offer some personal views for criticism and correction.
    Last year, the leadership responsible for the Yangtze River Basin planning, starting from the requirements of flood control, proposed the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir, wanting to use a major hub on the Yangtze River's main stream as the first phase of the Yangtze River Basin planning, to defend against the once-in-a-thousand-year extraordinary floods of the Yangtze River. After the completion of this project, it can not only control the main source of the Yangtze River floods, but also build the world's largest super-giant hydropower station, and allow 10,000-ton freighters to directly reach Chongqing. Obviously, this is a major project that stirs people's hearts.
    Building the Three Gorges Reservoir for flood control requires material and financial resources that cannot be achieved in the short term
    However, to build such a huge project as the Three Gorges, the material and financial resources required are not something that our country can afford in the short term. The Three Gorges project is estimated to cost more than 10 billion yuan, and more importantly, while building a huge hydropower station, it is necessary to build factories and enterprises that can consume such a large amount of electricity to cooperate. Otherwise, the benefits of the project cannot be fully realized. To build corresponding factories and enterprises, the investment amount generally needs to reach five to ten times the investment of the power station itself. From the perspective of investment alone, whether such a concentrated investment can be borne by our country in the near future is still a key issue in the planning. Those engaged in planning work certainly cannot only see how great the benefits are, without considering the possibility of national investment, and without considering the normal development of the entire national economy. It can be seen that the Three Gorges project is by no means something that can be built in the near future.
    The inundation loss of the reservoir is also very serious
    The Three Gorges project is not only a huge investment, but its reservoir inundation loss is also very serious. For example, if the normal high water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir reaches 235 meters above the Wusong datum, it will submerge 24 cities along the Yangtze River above Yichang, especially Chongqing, which will be mostly submerged. Chongqing is the largest industrial city in southwestern China. Is it reasonable to submerge Chongqing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in order to protect the Jingjiang Dike in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and areas such as Wuhan from the threat of floods that occur once in hundreds or thousands of years? At the same time, the Three Gorges Reservoir will also submerge 1.6 million mu of farmland. From the perspective of inundation losses alone, there is a big question as to whether it is economically worthwhile to build the Three Gorges Reservoir from the perspective of flood control. From the perspective of power generation, there is no need to build such a large power station in the recent five-year plan period. It is not necessarily necessary to build such a large reservoir in the future, and it is impossible to spend such a high price for shipping.
    The time required to build a reservoir is very long and cannot solve the urgent flood control problem
    Furthermore, the time required to build the Three Gorges project is very long and cannot solve the urgent flood control problem. In the Three Gorges project, many technical problems exceed the existing world level. Although these are not insurmountable difficulties, it will ultimately take a considerable amount of time for scientific research and practical experience to enable our technical level to catch up with and surpass the world level, which cannot be achieved overnight. When these technical problems are successfully resolved and the country's economic capacity can invest so much capital, it is estimated that it will take at least five years for design and ten years for construction to complete the Three Gorges project. During these ten years or more, it is naturally impossible to rely on the Three Gorges Reservoir to solve the Yangtze River's flood control problem. The Yangtze River's floods and droughts are very frequent. On average, a relatively large flood may occur every five or six years. The 1954 flood has passed for three years. Maybe another big flood will come in that year, as well as more frequent general floods and inland waterlogging disasters. So, what methods should be used to prevent or reduce these flood losses in a timely manner? When the leading ideology of the Yangtze River planning is focused on the Three Gorges project, less consideration is given to such problems than before. Or it is believed that only large reservoirs can completely solve the flood problem, and other effective measures are neglected; or it is believed that the transition period before the large reservoir is very short, and it is unlikely that a large flood will occur. These ideas are not conducive to truly eliminating the Yangtze River's flood disasters.
    Utilizing dikes and lakes and depressions are practical and feasible flood control measures
    In order to eliminate the Yangtze River's floods and droughts, is it necessary to rely on large reservoirs? As mentioned above, from the perspective of investment, inundation losses, or construction time, relying on large reservoirs for flood control is neither realistic nor reasonable. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission's proposal in 1954 to utilize dikes and lakes and depressions should be a practical and feasible flood control and drainage measure for the Yangtze River. Some people think that this is a temporary measure for the transition period; however, we must realize that this transition period may last for decades. During these decades, this is a very important flood control and drainage measure. Unfortunately, in the past year or more, there has been almost no further research on the utilization of dikes and lakes and depressions. The existing problems have not been resolved, and some projects that should be done quickly have not been actively carried out due to the optimistic estimate of building large reservoirs. The quality of the Jingjiang Dike's dike foundation and dike body is poor. The leaders and planners often say that this is the most important section of the Yangtze River's flood control. In the event of a breach, it will cause devastating disasters with a large number of deaths, which is the main reason for building the Three Gorges Reservoir. However, in the long period before the Three Gorges Reservoir is built, how can the breach of the Jingjiang Dike be prevented?
    The beautiful prospects of the Three Gorges project have also been reported in newspapers and magazines in recent years, and everyone is paying attention after seeing them. If the practical significance of the Three Gorges project is not made clear, it will also cause misunderstandings among the masses, leading to waiting for the large reservoir to completely solve the flood problem, while neglecting the necessity of strengthening existing dikes and lakes and flood storage. If another major flood occurs, it will fall into a passive situation. Therefore, it is necessary to arouse everyone's attention that in a considerable period of time, it is still necessary to rely on various existing flood control measures, and their role should be continuously strengthened. We must not relax the things that should be done now while expecting a distant reservoir. On the other hand, due to the proposal of the Three Gorges elevation of 235 meters, it has affected the arrangement of industrial expansion plans in Chongqing and other cities in Sichuan Province. It is beneficial to clarify the problem sooner.
    Small investment, simple project, can play a flood control role as soon as possible
    Utilizing dikes and lakes and depressions is an effective tool for the working people of our country to fight floods for thousands of years, and it has played a great flood control role. Taking the 1954 Yangtze River flood as an example, the flood in this year was larger than in 1931. Due to the timely raising of the dikes and the serious defense, and the planned use of lakes and depressions, the inundation loss was smaller than in 1931. In 1931, Wuhan was flooded, and the loss was extremely large. In 1954, the dikes were temporarily raised by 1.5 meters, which still protected Wuhan from being flooded. After 1954, the dikes in the key areas of the Yangtze River have been further strengthened, and considerable experience has been gained. If we seriously absorb the rich experience of the working people in utilizing dikes in the past, and apply the latest scientific and technological knowledge to summarize and improve, we should have the confidence and assurance to gradually improve the existing dikes and make full use of them, and the burden of flood control can also be reduced.
    Utilizing lakes and depressions for flood storage and drainage is an effective measure that combines the specific conditions of the Yangtze River. There were many lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which are a group of natural reservoirs for regulating and storing floods. Due to the continuous siltation of sediment brought by the upstream for a long time, especially the unplanned artificial reclamation in modern times, the lake area has been reduced, and the flood storage function has gradually decreased. However, there are still many lakes and depressions in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River that can be fully utilized. The flood control and drainage plan in the middle reaches plans to use more than 40 billion cubic meters of effective capacity, while the effective storage capacity of the Three Gorges Reservoir at the normal high water level of 200 meters is only more than 40 billion cubic meters. It can be seen that the potential of lakes and depressions is very large. After these lakes and depressions are artificially controlled, they can be used for flood storage in large flood years, and land reclamation and drainage can be increased in normal years. Since the opportunity for flood storage in lakes and depressions is reduced, sediment deposition can also be reduced and their lifespan can be extended. The total investment required for all flood storage and reclamation projects in the lakes and depressions in the middle reaches, including dike renovation projects, is about 600 million yuan (some of the projects have been completed), which is much less than the investment in building large reservoirs. Moreover, all projects are relatively simple and decentralized, and may be completed in a short period of two or three years, playing a role as soon as possible. It fully conforms to the principle of "spending less money and doing more things."
    Can guarantee the safety of key areas
    Utilizing dikes and lakes and depressions can not only prevent general floods and droughts in the Yangtze River and reduce the inundation losses of extremely large floods, but also guarantee the safety of key areas. For example, the Jingjiang area can defend against floods that occur once in 200 years by using the newly built Jingjiang flood diversion project after liberation, as well as the planned strengthening of the dike and other flood diversion measures. The dikes in Wuhan have been raised and reinforced. According to the flood control experience in 1954, even in the event of extremely large floods, flood diversion measures can be adopted in its upstream and downstream in a planned manner to ensure that Wuhan will not be flooded. This is a flood control standard that can be achieved in the near future without building reservoirs. This standard is fully in line with the spirit of the "National Agricultural Development Program" regarding flood control requirements.
    Based on the above reasons, I believe that the water conservancy departments responsible for flood control in the Yangtze River should currently focus their main efforts on actively studying the flood control and drainage measures of utilizing dikes and lakes and depressions, and promote their early realization, so as to realistically eliminate the floods and droughts in the Yangtze River. If too much effort is put into studying the long-term large reservoirs and large projects, it may delay the flood control problems that urgently need to be solved, which is detrimental to the country and the people.

　　不要只追求大水库而误了防洪排涝
　　电力工业部水电总局设计总院专业总工程师  陆钦侃
    在长江流域的规划工作中，防洪问题是作为首要任务提出来的。但是，对于怎样合理解决长江的防洪问题，各方面的看法还不一致。这个矛盾应当怎样解决呢？我根据自己一年多来参加长江规划工作的体会，提出一些个人的看法，请大家批评指正。
    去年，负责长江流域规划的领导方面，从防洪的要求出发，提出了修建三峡水库的方案，想以长江干流大枢纽作为长江流域规划的第一期工程，以此来防御长江的千年一遇的非常洪水。这个工程完工后，不仅可以控制长江洪水的主要来源，还可以建成世界上最大的超巨型水电站，并使万吨海轮直通重庆。显然，这是一个震动人心的大工程。
    修建三峡水库用来防洪所需物力财力短期办不到
    但是，要建设三峡这样巨大的工程，所需投入的物力财力却不是我国短期内所能办到的。三峡工程估计造价达百余亿元，而且更重要的是在建设巨大水电站的同时，必需建设能够消纳如此大量电能的工厂企业来配合。否则，工程的效益不能充分发挥。要建设相应的工厂企业，投资量一般要达到电站本身投资的五倍到十倍。只从投资而言，这样集中的投资是否我国近期所能负担，还是规划中一个关键问题。作规划工作的人员当然不能只看到效益如何大，而不考虑国家投资的可能性，不考虑整个国民经济的正常发展。由此可见，三峡工程决不是近期所能兴建的。
    水库的淹没损失也很严重
    三峡工程不但投资庞大，其水库淹没损失也是非常严重的。如三峡水库的正常高水位达到吴淞基面以上二百三十五公尺，将淹没宜昌以上沿长江的二十四个城市，其中特别是重庆市要大部被淹掉。重庆是我国西南最大的工业城市，为了保护长江中下游的荆江大堤及武汉市等地区防御几百年或千年一遇的洪水威胁，而淹没长江上游的重庆市是否合理呢？同时，三峡水库还要淹没农田一百六十万亩。以淹没损失一项来看，从防洪出发要求兴建三峡大水库，在经济上是否合算就是很大的疑问。从发电来讲，最近几个五年计划时期内没有必要兴建这样大的电站，将来建设三峡水电站也不一定需要这样大的水库，为了航运也不可能花费这样高的代价。
    修建水库所需的时间很长不能解决迫切的防洪问题
    再说，修建三峡工程所需的时间很长，并不能解决迫切的防洪问题。三峡工程中，有很多技术问题都是超过现有世界水平的，虽非不能克服的困难，但终究要经过相当长时间的科学研究和实践经验，才能使我们的技术水平赶上并超过世界水平，决非一蹴即就的事。在这些技术问题都得到顺利解决，国家的经济能力也能够投入这样多资金的时候，据估计至少还要经过五年设计十年施工才能将三峡工程建设完成。在此十几年的过程中，自然不能依靠三峡水库来解决长江的防洪问题。长江的洪涝灾害是很频繁的，平均五、六年就可能发生一次比较大的洪水，1954年洪水已经过去了三年，说不定那一年再来一次大水，还有更经常的一般洪水和内涝溃灾。那么，应当用什么方法来及时防止或减轻这些水灾损失呢？当长江规划的领导思想集中于三峡工程的时候，对这样的问题就考虑得比以前少了。或者认为唯有大水库才能彻底解决洪水问题，而轻视了其他的有效措施；或者认为大水库以前的过渡时期很短，可能不致发生大洪水。这些想法，对真正解除长江的洪水灾害是不利的。
    利用堤防和湖泊、洼地是切实可行的防洪措施
    为了解除长江的洪涝灾害，是否非靠大水库不可呢？如上所述，不论从投资、淹没损失或建设时间来看，依靠大水库来防洪是既不现实，又不合理的。1954年长江水利委员会提出的利用堤防与湖泊洼地，应当是长江的切实可行的防洪排涝措施。有人认为这是过渡时期的临时措施；可是，我们必须认识到，这个过渡时期可能长达数十年，在数十年内，这是很重要的防洪排涝措施。遗憾的是，这一年多来，对于堤防和湖泊洼地的利用，几乎没有进一步加以研究，存在的问题没有设法解决，有些应当快做的工程，也因对修建大水库的乐观估计而没有积极进行。荆江大堤的堤基堤身质量不佳，领导规划者常说这是长江防洪的最重要堤段，万一溃决会造成大量淹死人命的毁灭性灾害，以此为修建三峡水库的主要理由。但是在三峡水库还没有修建起来的长时间内，怎样防止荆江大堤的溃决呢？
    三峡工程的美好远景，年来在报纸杂志上也曾有过不少报道，大家看到后是很注意的。假如对于三峡工程的现实意义不说清楚的话，也会引起广大群众的误会，以致等待大水库彻底解决洪水问题，而忽视了加强现有堤防和湖泊、蓄洪的必要性。假如再发生大洪水时，就会陷于被动。因此，必须唤起大家注意，在相当长的时期内，还必须依靠现有各种防洪措施，而且应当不断加强它们的作用，决不应当期待着遥远的水库而放松了目前应做的事情。另一方面，由于三峡高程二百三十五公尺方案的提出，曾经影响到重庆市及四川省其他城市工业扩建计划的安排，早一点把问题说清楚是有好处的。
    投资不多工程又简单能及早发挥防洪作用
    利用堤防与湖泊洼地，是我国几千年来劳动人民与洪水作斗争的有效工具，曾经产生过极大的防洪作用。即以1954年长江的洪水为例，这一年的洪水比1931年为大，由于堤防的及时加高和认真防守，湖泊洼地的有计划运用，使得淹没损失反较1931年为小。1931年武汉市被淹，损失极大，1954年临时加高堤防一公尺五，还是保护了武汉市没有受淹。1954年以后，长江重点地区的堤防已作了进一步的加强，今后把堤防再修好一些，湖泊洼地再控制得好一些，还可以提高防洪能力，大大降低水灾的损失。长江的堤防与湖泊洼地具有很大的潜力，只要花费较少的投资，加以整理加固，就可以发挥很大的作用。据估计长江中游堤防相差一公尺高程的下泄量，相当于水库或湖泊的蓄洪容量约四百亿公方。由于长江的洪水特点是洪水量特别大，所以更显出堤防是很重要的防洪措施。
    利用堤防来防洪，目前最困难的问题是现有堤防质量较差，因此每遇大洪水要动员数十万人上堤防汛，紧张斗争，才能防止它溃决成灾。这是因为过去对于堤防的修建一般没有经过很好的规划设计，农民堆土筑堤也不考究质量，因此挡不住巨大洪水的冲刷。经过解放后几年来的整修，长江堤防已经大为改善，并已取得相当经验。假如我们认真吸取过去劳动人民利用堤防的丰富经验，并应用最新的科学技术知识加以总结提高，我们应当有信心有把握将现有堤防逐步改善，加以充分利用，而且防汛负担也是可以减轻的。
    利用湖泊洼地来蓄洪排涝，乃是结合长江具体情况的有效措施。长江中下游原有很多湖泊，是一群天然调蓄洪水的水库，由于长远以来不断被上游带来的泥沙所淤积，特别是近代无计划地人为围垦，使湖泊面缩小，蓄洪作用逐渐降低。不过，长江中下游目前还存在着不少的湖泊洼地是可以充分利用的。中游防洪排溃方案中所拟利用的就有四百多亿公方的有效容积，而三峡大水库正常高水位二百公尺的时候的有效库容，也不过四百多亿公方。可见湖泊洼地的潜力是很大的。把这些湖泊洼地加以人为的控制后，大洪水年利用它蓄洪，一般年份可以增垦和排涝。由于湖泊洼地蓄洪的机会减少了，还可以减少泥沙淤积，延长它们的寿命。所有中游区的湖泊洼地蓄洪垦殖工程，包括整修堤防工程在内，所需投资共计约六亿元（其中有一部分工程已经完成），比修建大水库的投资要少得多。而且所有工程比较简单而分散，可能在二、三年的短时期内完成，及早地发生作用。完全符合“少花钱多办事”的原则。
    可以保证重点地区的安全
    利用堤防与湖泊洼地，不仅可以防止长江的一般洪涝灾害，减轻特大洪水的淹没损失，而且可以保证重点地区的安全。如荆江区利用解放后新建的荆江分洪工程以及计划中的加固大堤及其他分洪措施，就可以防御二百年一遇的洪水。武汉市的堤防已经加高加固，根据1954年的防汛经验，即遇特大洪水也可以有计划地在其上下游采用分洪措施，保证武汉市不致被淹。这是不需要修建水库而在最近时期就可以达到的防洪标准。这种标准，是完全符合“全国农业发展纲要”关于防洪要求的精神的。
    基于上述理由，我认为负责长江防洪的水利部门，目前应当以主要力量积极研究利用堤防及湖泊洼地等的防洪排涝措施，并促其早日实现，以便实事求是地解除长江的洪涝灾害。如果投入太多的力量研究远景的大水库大工程，就可能因此而贻误了目前迫切需要解决的防洪问题，这样对国家对人民都是不利的。
