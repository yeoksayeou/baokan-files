　　In the past month or so of helping the Party to carry out rectification, my personal progress has surpassed that of the past few years. After I poured out all the words in my stomach, in my heart, it was like demolishing walls and filling in trenches. I didn't become more distant from the Party, but closer; not more indifferent, but more warm.

　　For example, regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I always thought that the achievements were the main thing, but the deviations were also very large, and I complained that the Party should not suspect the old professors too much. But after calming down and thinking about it, and looking at the Hungarian incident, it felt like I suddenly understood. If there had been no suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and we had a Hungarian incident here, could we have withstood it? If there had been no suppression of counter-revolutionaries, could we still be sitting here speaking our minds freely? The Party saw far ahead. We must see the achievements, and the achievements are absolutely the main thing, and must not be mentioned in the same breath as the deviations. Thinking further, even when looking at the deviations, we must look at them developmentally. The deviations were more numerous in the early stages of the movement, and later became very few, almost none, and most of these deviations were due to some comrades being naive and lacking experience. In revolutionary struggles, it is common to hurt some of our own people. Does that mean we should not have a revolution? To use an analogy, if two brothers go to fight thieves, they might accidentally hit one of their own in the dark, but driving the thieves away is the greatest good thing. For the sake of the interests of six hundred million people, what does it matter if one is accidentally injured! Thinking like this, I felt calm and open-minded, and my position on the issue seemed to have changed.

　　Therefore, I became more enthusiastic about helping the Party with rectification. I offered suggestions to the Party out of love for the Party, and therefore I also wanted others to adopt this attitude. But during this period, judging from the newspapers, the tone was becoming increasingly wrong. Those who wanted to resurrect the dead became more and more blatant. The moment I smelled this kind of odor, I became very angry. They even shouted that the Communist Party should withdraw from schools and factories! They said that the root of the "three evils" lies in the dictatorship of the proletariat! They said that the anti-Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was a "literary inquisition of new China"! They even said that "the masses want to kill the Communist Party," etc. Which "masses" are they talking about? I'm afraid it can only include those "masses" of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan! You say the Communist Party cannot lead, may I ask who can lead? Before liberation, I taught for more than twenty years, changed more than ten universities, and traveled all over half of China, but crows are black all over the world. I firmly believe that there is no better party than the Communist Party under heaven. I know that the Communist Party has shortcomings, and I also have opinions about the Party, but I believe that through this rectification, it will definitely be rectified. My confidence is unwavering. As the old saying goes: When the Yellow River is clear, a sage will appear. Now it is: When a sage appears, the Yellow River is clear. Isn't this a fact? Some people are trying to say that the Communist Party is good for nothing, and treat the achievements of the revolution as sins. I really don't know what kind of heart they have? But I must draw a clear line with such people.

　　Now we are sitting on the same boat with the Communist Party, a boat that is transitioning to socialism. The Communist Party is the helmsman, and we are all rowers. Everyone must have the heart to help each other in the same boat. For example, if there is a hole in the boat and it is leaking, everyone must work together to plug it, because if the boat sinks, everyone will sink with it. When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. But those people mentioned above, who don't know what kind of heart they have, although they are also sitting on the same boat, what they hope for is that the hole will leak even more and the boat will sink faster, because what they have is not the heart to help each other in the same boat, but the heart to plot wealth and kill lives?

　　We must be good friends of the Communist Party. We know that making friends must be based on mutual understanding. If I want to be your friend, I should first think that you are indeed worthy of being my friend, and truly understand and admit that you do have advantages, so that you can help me, and at the same time understand your shortcomings, so that I can also help you. If I make friends with you just because I see that you have money in your pocket and cigarettes to smoke, this is definitely not a reliable friend. Now some people call themselves friends of the Party, but they always want to smear their friend's face with ash, and they are only happy when they say that their friend is a mess. I think that such people may not be friends at all.

　　I am a doctor. If someone comes to me for treatment, but I alarm the patient by saying: You won't live long, give me your money, you are going to die anyway, let me dissect you, what would that be? Now some people are taking advantage of helping the Party with rectification to spread nonsense, which is really annoying! If the Communist Party is not willing to be angry, others will not be willing to be angry. I will speak fairly and stand up for justice. I say that if you do this, it will only arouse public anger.

　　Helping the Communist Party to overcome the "three evils" should be seen as a matter of one's own family. In a family, it is common for a son to have some opinions about his father, and a wife about her husband. You can hold a family meeting to criticize, and even argue until your faces are red. At this time, if a thief thinks that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, and bravely jumps into the window to steal the quilt, he will unexpectedly be caught by the whole family. Because not letting the thief steal people's quilts is the common interest of the whole family. The thief miscalculated and of course he can only be unlucky! Helping the Communist Party should be like a family matter. Who wants to overthrow the Communist Party in this way, how can people support it! The result must be as unlucky as this thief.

　　Helping the Communist Party with rectification is actually helping ourselves and testing ourselves. Chinese people have a habit of seeing a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, that is, the patient does not say his symptoms first, but asks the doctor to take his pulse, and asks the doctor to talk about the condition. This is the patient testing the doctor. If the doctor says the patient's symptoms very accurately, then the patient can trust you and regard you as a good doctor; if you are a bunch of nonsense, you will inevitably be seen through by the patient, and you turn out to be a fake doctor! Now the Communist Party is asking everyone to criticize and help overcome the "three evils", but for ourselves, it is an extremely profound test to see what position we are standing on, and in the depths of our thoughts, whether we sincerely love the Party or not? In this struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, who do we follow? Where are we going? This is a good opportunity for us to temper our thoughts and positions. Everyone should strive to become a leftist.

　　The rightists' estimation of the market is a big mistake, and their underestimation of the progress made by us intellectuals in the past few years under the education of the Party is also a mistake. They attempt to find cracks, find objects, win over sympathizers, exaggerate deviations, use shortcomings, confuse the public in order to isolate the Party, but the result is that they isolate themselves. I hope they can learn a lesson from this and turn back as soon as possible.

### 坐在一条船要有一条心

　　坐在一条船要有一条心
　　沈阳医学院教授　李佩琳
    在帮助党正进行整风的一个多月中，就我个人的进步来说是过去几年都赶不上的。当我把肚子里的话痛痛快快都说出以后，在我心里头，就是拆了墙填了沟，和党不是更远了，而是更亲近了，不是更冷淡了，而是更感到温暖了。
    比如对肃反，过去总是认为成绩是主要的，但是偏差也很大，埋怨党不该对老教授怀疑太多。但是静下来想想，再看看匈牙利事件，心里就好像忽然明白起来，假如没有肃反，在我们这里也来个匈牙利事件，这受得了吗？假如没有肃反，我们还能坐在这里大鸣大放么？还是党看得远。要看到那个成绩，成绩绝对是主要的，绝不能和偏差相提并论。再想想，就是看偏差也要发展的看，偏差较多的是运动初期，以后就很少，几乎没有，而且这些偏差大部分是由于有些同志幼稚和缺乏经验所致。在革命斗争中，伤害些自己人往往是常事，难道就能不革命么？打个比喻，兄弟两个人去打贼，在黑头里也许打着了自己人，但是把贼打跑了就是最大的好事。为了六亿人的利益，误伤了自己那又有什么了不得呢！这样一想，就心平气和、胸襟开朗，看问题的立场也好像变了过来。
    因此我对帮助党进行整风有了积极性。我给党提意见，我是从爱护党出发的，因此我也愿意别人也采取这个态度。但是这一时期从报纸上看，味道却是越闻越不对头，想借尸还魂的人越来越露骨，一闻到这种味道就使我很生气，竟然叫嚷什么要共产党退出学校、退出工厂去！说什么“三害”的根在无产阶级专政呀！说什么反胡风反革命集团是“新中国的文字狱”呀！还说“群众要杀共产党”等等，究竟是那个“群众”呀，恐怕只能包括台湾蒋介石那个“群众”吧！你说共产党不能领导，请问谁能领导？解放前我教了二十多年书，换了十多个大学，跑遍了半个中国，但是天下老鸦一般黑。在普天之下，能找到比共产党更好的党，我是坚决不相信的。我知道共产党有缺点，我对党也有意见，但是我相信，通过这次整风一定能整好，我的信心是决不动摇的。老话说：黄河清，圣人出。现在是：圣人出，黄河清。难道这不是事实吗？有的人却企图把共产党说得一无是处，把革命的成绩当作罪恶来讲，我真不知道这是安的什么样的心？但是我一定要和这样的人划清界限。
    现在我们和共产党坐的是一条船，是向社会主义过渡的船。共产党是舵手，我们都是摇橹的，大家都要有同舟共济之心。比如船上有了洞，漏水了，大家就要齐心协力来堵，因为船沉了，大家都要跟着沉下去的，复巢之下就没有完卵。但是像上边所说的那些不知安什么样心的人，虽然也坐在一条船上，然而所希望的却是洞漏得更大，船沉得更快，因为他们有的不是同舟共济之心，而却有谋财害命之心？
    我们要做共产党的益友。我们知道交朋友必须相知。我要和你交朋友，首先应该认为你确实值得做我的朋友，真正了解和承认你确有优点，这样可以对我有所帮助，同时也了解你的缺点，我也可以帮助你。如果我和你交朋友，只是看到你腰包里有钱，还有烟可抽，这一定不是可靠的朋友。现在有的自称为党的朋友，却总想在朋友的脸上抹上一脸灰，把朋友说得一团糟才甘心，我看，这样的人也许根本不是朋友。
    我是一个医生，如果有人来我这里看病，我却向病人危言耸听，告诉他：你活不长久了，把你的钱给我吧，反正你要死了，让我来给你解剖了吧，这成什么话呢？现在就是有人借着帮着党整风为名，专门胡说八道，实在叫人讨厌！假如共产党不愿意生气的话，旁人也要不愿意，我就要说公道话，打抱不平的。我说你们要这样做的话，只能激起大家的公愤。
    帮助共产党克服“三害”，应该看为自己家里的事。在一个家庭里儿子对父亲、妻子对丈夫有些意见也是常事，可以开个家庭会议批评批评，甚至也可以争得面红耳赤。此时如果有一个小偷就认为有机可乘，勇敢地跳进窗子去偷被子，却不料全家人都来捉贼，一下就被捉住了。因为不让小偷偷人被子，这是全家人的共同利益。小偷估计错了，当然只好倒霉！帮助共产党，就应像家里事，谁想就此推倒共产党，怎么能叫人拥护！结果也必然要像这个小偷一样倒霉。
    帮助共产党整风，实际就是帮助自己，考验我们自己。中国人请中医看病有个习惯，就是病人先不说自己病状，而是给医生把把脉，要让医生说说病情，这就是病人考医生，如果医生把病人的症状说得很对，如此病人才能信任你，才能把你视为良医；如果你是一派胡说，必然为病人识破，原来你是个冒牌医生！现在共产党请大家批评，帮助克服“三害”，但是对我们自己来说，就是一场极其深刻的考验，看看我们究竟是站在什么立场，在我们的思想深处，究竟是真心爱护党，还是不爱护党？在这场无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争中，我们究竟跟谁走？要往何处去？这就是我们锻炼自己的思想和立场的好机会，我们每个人应争取成为左派。
    右派分子对市场的估计是个大错误，对我们这些知识分子几年来在党的教育下的进步，也是估计不足的，他们企图寻找裂痕、物色对象、拉拢同情者，夸大偏差、利用缺点、混淆视听以此来孤立党，结果却是孤立了自己。希望他们能够从此吸取教训及早回头。
