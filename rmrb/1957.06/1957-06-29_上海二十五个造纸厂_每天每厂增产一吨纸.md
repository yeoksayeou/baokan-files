Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th - Shanghai's twenty-five paper mills have increased production by an average of one ton per day per factory in the first half of this year. The increased paper production in six months will exceed the state plan by more than four thousand five hundred tons. The annual production increase plan for these factories this year is six thousand tons.

In the first half of this year, Shanghai's paper-making raw materials were in severe shortage. Many factories sent people to other places to find new sources of raw materials. During these six months, their footprints covered more than twenty cities in nine provinces, including Guangxi and Shandong, purchasing large quantities of Phragmites sinensis, reeds, rags, and waste paper.

The pulp consumption for various types of paper has generally decreased in recent months in these factories after the workers paid attention to improving operations and reducing losses.

　　上海二十五个造纸厂
    每天每厂增产一吨纸
    据新华社上海28日电　上海二十五个造纸厂，今年上半年平均每一天每个厂增产一吨纸。六个月中增产的纸将比国家计划多出四千五百吨以上。这些厂今年全年的增产计划是六千吨。
    今年上半年，上海造纸原料非常缺乏，许多厂纷纷派人到外地去寻找新的原料来源。在这半年内，他们的足迹遍及了广西、山东等九个省的二十多个城市，采购了大批龙须草、芦苇和破布、废纸。
    各种纸张的用浆，今年这几个月中在各厂职工注意改进操作、减少流失以后，普遍有了降低。
