Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 1st: In rural areas of Hebei Province, Party organizations are concentrating their efforts to help agricultural cooperatives in wheat-producing areas solve summer grain distribution problems in the spirit of rectification.

The responsible person of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told Xinhua News Agency reporters yesterday that the summer grain distribution issue is one of the most pressing concerns of farmers throughout the province. The correct resolution of this issue is of paramount importance for encouraging farmers to strive for increased autumn grain production. After Hebei Province held a provincial summer grain distribution conference in late April, most counties convened meetings of township Party committee secretaries and agricultural cooperative directors to jointly discuss ways to resolve various specific contradictions in summer grain distribution. Various counties also conducted pilot pre-distributions. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various localities are conducting yield assessments and democratically formulating distribution plans.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that the more prominent contradiction in summer grain distribution is the conflict between the amount of grain purchased by the state under the unified purchase system and the desire of surplus grain cooperative members to retain more grain, and the desire of grain-deficient cooperative members to consume more. Due to the disasters suffered by Hebei Province last year, and the current summer famine season, the state urgently needs to purchase the necessary amount of wheat to alleviate the tight grain situation before autumn. However, farmers, especially surplus grain cooperative members, lack understanding of this situation, making the contradiction even more prominent.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that there are currently three attitudes towards resolving this contradiction in summer grain distribution. The first is to consider all the opinions raised by cooperative members and cadres during discussions, such as requests to retain more grain and purchase less, criticisms of the "more labor, no more food" aspect of the unified purchase and distribution of grain, and the adoption of concealment measures to retain more grain, as wrong. Thus, without distinguishing right from wrong, without explaining the reasons clearly, they simply criticize and force the completion of the purchase tasks. The second attitude is to consider these opinions and requests as correct, without analysis, without conducting arduous ideological work, and even unwilling to publicize the grain purchase methods, simply requesting the higher authorities to purchase less and retain more. Both of these attitudes and practices make it difficult to correctly solve the problem of combining the overall interests with individual interests in summer grain distribution. The third attitude is to present the difficulties, explain the reasons clearly, clarify the policies, consult with everyone, distinguish right from wrong, and solve the problems. Many pilot experiences have proven that adopting this approach yields better results. The responsible person said that as long as local facts and easy-to-understand reasons are used to explain that the fundamental problem lies in the fact that the current grain production level is still low, the people's needs are great, and the disasters of last year have further aggravated the difficulties in grain distribution. Surplus grain areas demand less purchase, and grain-deficient areas demand more supply. This contradiction can only be resolved by everyone actively cooperating with the state, enthusiastically selling grain, and practicing strict economy. As long as the reasons are explained thoroughly and everyone discusses solutions based on the policies, things will be easier. This is what was done in the pilot projects in Biao Ling Cooperative in Gaocheng County and Dongwang Cooperative in Xingtai County. The cooperative members are willing to help the state overcome these difficulties. Not only has it not affected the masses' production enthusiasm, but on the contrary, the masses' production enthusiasm has been improved. People who work hard say: "As long as there is a slight difference in grain consumption between those who work well and those who don't, that will be enough."

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that many of the opinions and requests raised by the masses during discussions should not be summarily considered as resistant emotions. In fact, some opinions, such as the request that grain from private plots should not be included in the consumption quota, that livestock feed should be slightly more during the busy farming season, and that average per capita grain distribution is unreasonable, are correct and should be adopted and resolved. Some opinions are correct, but difficult to resolve at present, such as universally improving the grain consumption level of people and livestock; and some opinions are wrong, such as advocating the concealment of production to achieve the goal of distributing more grain. As long as in-depth education is combined with the correct implementation of grain purchase policies, these problems will be easily resolved as awareness increases.

The responsible person of the Provincial Party Committee said that based on the experiences of some counties last year and the opinions of the vast number of farmers this year, it is necessary to change the practice of average per capita grain distribution and switch to the method of allocating grain based on fixed quantities per person and reasonable distribution. He also said that verifying the yield of summer crops is extremely important for adjusting the interests of the state and the cooperative, and this work should be done realistically with the cooperative cadres and members, and subjectivism should not be committed.

### 河北省委负责人谈怎样做好夏收分配工作  摆出困难　分清是非　大家商量　解决问题

    河北省委负责人谈怎样做好夏收分配工作
    摆出困难　分清是非　大家商量　解决问题
    新华社保定1日电　在河北省农村中，党的组织正集中力量以整风的精神帮助产麦区农业社解决夏收分配问题。
    中共河北省委负责人昨天对新华社记者说，夏收分配问题是目前全省农民最关心的问题之一。这个问题的正确解决，对于鼓舞农民争取秋粮增产有头等重要的意义。河北省在4月下旬开过全省夏收分配会议以后，大部分县都召开了乡党委书记和农业社主任会议，共同商量解决夏收分配中各项具体矛盾的办法。各县还作了预分试点。目前，各地农业社正在进行评产和民主制定分配方案。
    省委负责人说，夏收分配中比较突出的矛盾是国家统购的粮食数量，同余粮社社员要求多留、缺粮社社员要求多吃之间的矛盾。由于去年河北省受灾，现在又当夏荒时节，国家急需购到必要数量的小麦以缓和秋前粮食紧张情况，而农民特别是余粮社社员对这种情况还缺乏了解，使得矛盾更形突出。
    省委负责人说，解决夏收分配中的这个矛盾现在有三种态度。第一种是，认为社员和社干部在讨论中提出的意见，比如要求多留一些、少购一些，批评统购分配粮食的办法中“多劳不能多吃”，以及采取瞒产办法多留粮食等等，都是错误的。于是不分是非，不讲清道理，一味地加以批判，强迫完成征购任务。另一种态度是，认为这些意见和要求都是对的，也不作分析，不进行艰苦的思想工作，甚至连购粮办法也不愿宣传，只是向上面要求少购多留。这两种态度和作法，都难以正确地解决夏收分配中整体利益和个人利益相结合的问题。第三种态度是，摆出困难，说清道理，讲明政策，大家商量，分清是非，解决问题。不少试点经验证明，采取这种作法结果都比较好。负责人说，只要用本省本地的事实和易懂的道理，说明根本问题在于目前产粮水平还低，人民需要大，加上去年受灾，更加重了粮食分配中的困难。余粮的要求少购，缺粮的要求多供。这个矛盾，只有靠大家主动与国家合作，踊跃缴售，厉行节约，才能解决。只要把道理讲透了，让大家根据政策商量办法，事情就好办了。藁城县表灵社、邢台县东旺社等试点中这样作了，社员们是愿意帮助国家克服这些困难的，不仅没有影响群众的生产情绪，相反，群众的生产积极性提高了。劳动好的人说：“只要劳动好的、不好的，在吃粮上显出点高低，也就行了。”
    省委负责人说，在讨论中群众提出的很多意见和要求，不能笼统认为是抵触情绪。实际上，如要求自留地产的粮食不计入消费指标，牲口的饲料在农忙时略多些，平均计口授粮不合理等等，这些意见是对的，应该采纳和解决。也有些意见虽对，但目前还难以解决，如普遍提高人、畜的粮食消费水平；还有些意见是不对的，如主张以瞒产办法达到多分粮食的目的。这些，只要做到把深入教育同正确执行购粮政策相结合，随着觉悟的提高，问题也就容易解决了。
    省委负责人说，根据去年一些县的经验和今年广大农民的意见，必须改变平均计口授粮的作法，改行以人定量、合理分配吃粮的办法。他还说，核实夏收作物的产量，对于调整国家和社的利益有极重要的关系，这个工作要同社干部、社员一起实事求是地做，不能犯主观主义。
