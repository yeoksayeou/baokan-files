Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: Sakai Naka's daughter, Kayoko, whose mother was killed by the American soldier Girard, told the Associated Press reporter yesterday that she insisted that Girard be handed over to a Japanese court for trial.

Eighteen-year-old Kayoko also told the American reporter that she could not tolerate the crimes committed by Girard. She said, "For the four months since the incident, I have been hating Girard in my heart. My mother can never come back. Girard is guilty."

When the Associated Press reporter visited Sakai Naka's family, her husband told the American reporter that he doubted whether the Americans regarded Girard as a national hero. He said, "I hope that the person who killed my wife is not a national hero to the Americans."

The Associated Press reporter also interviewed Ono Seki Hideji on the same day, who was a witness at the scene when Sakai Naka was killed. Ono Seki described to the Associated Press reporter in detail how Girard threw out empty cartridges on the spot to lure Sakai Naka to pick them up, and then shot and killed Sakai Naka from behind.

The American soldier Nickel, who was also present when the incident occurred, refused to describe any scene of the incident when he met with the Associated Press reporter. Nickel has been placed under the "protection" of the American military authorities.

Brigadier General Decker, Assistant Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army, a personal representative appointed by U.S. Army Secretary Brucker, arrived in Tokyo by plane yesterday morning. Decker said upon arrival in Tokyo that Brucker asked him to "do his best to protect Girard's interests." Decker also said that he would hold talks with Japanese government officials on the Girard incident.

　　坂井中的女儿决报杀母之仇
　　要美国快交出凶手
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：被美国兵哲腊德杀死的日本农妇坂井中的女儿加代子昨天对合众社记者说，她坚持要求把哲腊德交由日本法庭进行审判。
    十八岁的加代子还对美国记者表示，她不能容忍哲腊德所犯的罪行。她说，“事件发生后的四个月来，我心里一直仇恨哲腊德。我的母亲再也不能回来。哲腊德是有罪的。”
    坂井中的丈夫在合众社记者访问他的家庭时对这个美国记者说，他怀疑美国人是否在把哲腊德看成是民族英雄。他说：“我希望杀死我妻子的人对美国人说来不是一个民族英雄。”
  合众社记者在同一天还访问了坂井中被杀害时在场的证人小野关秀次。小野关向合众社记者详细叙述了哲腊德当场扔出空弹壳引诱坂井中去拾捡，接着从背后开枪击毙坂井中的情况。
    事件发生时也在场的美国兵尼克尔在接见合众社记者时，却拒绝叙述事件发生时的任何现场情况。尼克尔已经被置于美国军事当局的“保护”之下。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克指派的私人代表美国陆军助理军法处长德克准将，已经在昨天上午乘飞机到达东京。德克在到达东京时说，布鲁克要求他“尽他所能去维护哲腊德的利益”。德克还说，他将就哲腊德事件与日本政府官员进行会谈。
