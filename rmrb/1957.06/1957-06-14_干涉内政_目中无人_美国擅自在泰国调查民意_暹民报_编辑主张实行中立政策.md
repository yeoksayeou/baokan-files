Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, June 13th: According to Thai newspapers, the United States Information Service (USIS) in Bangkok recently conducted public opinion polls in Thailand that were of a nature that interfered in Thailand's internal affairs.

The report said that the USIS commissioned a detective agency called "Thailand Research Institute" to complete a survey of the Thai public in eight districts of Bangkok. The survey covered attitudes towards the Manila Treaty Organization, China, and U.S. "aid" to Thailand, as well as opinions on each Thai newspaper.

Newspaper reports indicate that the USIS did not notify the Thai government in advance about this public opinion poll conducted in Thailand. According to the newspapers, this matter is currently attracting the attention of people from all walks of life in Thailand. "Picture News" reported on June 6 that some Thais who were surveyed felt that this interference by the USIS was a contempt for Thailand's honor.

In addition, Krit Pramoj, editor of "Siam Rath," recently stated in response to a reader's question about "whether Thailand should pursue neutrality" that Thailand should pursue a neutral policy.

Krit said that pursuing a neutral policy would bring Thailand more benefits than it currently has. The most obvious point is that when Thailand establishes friendly relations with other countries, military assistance will decrease, and military expenditures will also be reduced accordingly. Thailand could then accept foreign aid like India and Burma, which would directly benefit the people.

This famous Thai journalist emphasized that it is not easy to suddenly declare neutrality when Thailand is already bound by one bloc. However, it can still be carried out in a moderate way. First of all, the United States should be made aware that money cannot buy people's hearts.

Krit Pramoj was arrested by the Thai government in early April on charges of "insulting" the American ambassador. Although he has been released on bail, he will still be tried in court.

### 干涉内政　目中无人  美国擅自在泰国调查民意  “暹民报”编辑主张实行中立政策

　　干涉内政　目中无人
　　美国擅自在泰国调查民意
　　“暹民报”编辑主张实行中立政策
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，在曼谷的美国新闻处最近曾经在泰国进行带有干涉泰国内政性质的民意测验。
    消息说，美国新闻处委托一家叫做“泰国调查研究院”的侦探社，在曼谷府的八个县里完成了向泰国民众的调查工作。调查内容包括对马尼拉条约组织、对中国以及对美国“援助”泰国等问题的态度以及对泰国每一家报纸的意见。
    报纸消息说，美国新闻处这次在泰国进行的民意测验，事前并没有通知泰国政府。据报纸说，这件事目前正引起泰国各界人士的注意。“图画新闻”6日报道，一些受调查的泰国人都觉得，美国新闻处的这种干涉行为，是对泰国荣誉的藐视。
    另外“暹民报”编辑克里特·普腊莫最近在答复读者提出的“泰国应否实行中立”的问题时认为，泰国应该实行中立政策。
    克里特说，实行中立政策将使泰国获得较现时更多的利益。最明显的一点是：当泰国同其他国家建立友好关系以后，军事援助将减少，军费支出也将随着削减。泰国就可以像印度、缅甸那样去接受外国援助，这对人民必能产生直接利益。
    这位泰国著名的报界人士强调说，当泰国已经受到一个集团的约束，要突然宣布中立，毕竟是不容易的。不过，还是可以循温和的途径进行。首先要向美国指出，金钱是不能收买人心的。
    克里特·普腊莫曾经在4月初被泰国政府以“侮辱”美国大使的罪名加以逮捕，现在他虽然已经保释在外，但仍将受到法庭的审讯。
