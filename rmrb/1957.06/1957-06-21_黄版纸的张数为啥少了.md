    In Hangzhou's food stores, when customers buy walnut candy, pastries, and other foods, they always want to buy a cardboard box to carry them away. At this time, people often hear such conversations between customers and salespeople:
    "Why are the cardboard boxes more expensive than before?"
    "You still complain about the price; we can't even buy them with cash!"
    This unpleasant dialogue truthfully reflects the high cost of cardboard boxes and the shortage of supply in the market. In the past, a cardboard box for holding one pound of food in food stores only cost three or four cents, but now it costs five cents; a cardboard box for holding two pounds of food used to cost five or six cents, but now it costs seven cents. As for cardboard boxes for over a hundred kinds of goods such as Western medicine, wax paper, ink, glass cups, leather shoes, scissors, toothbrushes, and buttons, the prices have also increased by 2.8% to 8%. According to Hangzhou's food industry statistics, although business this year has expanded compared to the past, the supply of cardboard boxes in February decreased by 20% compared to the same period last year.
    Where have the cardboard boxes gone?
    Hangzhou has six cardboard box production cooperatives. In the past, from China Cultural Goods Company Hangzhou Branch (hereinafter referred to as Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company), one ton of No. 8 yellow printing paper could make 16,500 two-pound food boxes; since April last year, one ton of No. 8 yellow printing paper can only make 16,000 boxes. Hangzhou Red Star Cardboard Box Production Cooperative made six and a half tons of No. 8 yellow printing paper in March last year and March this year, but the number of two-pound boxes made was 2,900 fewer. Calculated at six cents per box, the cooperative earns 174 yuan less each month. The entire cooperative of 67 members earns more than two yuan less per member each month. Of course, more than one cooperative is suffering. The small Xinhua Wax Paper Factory increased its costs by more than 1,200 yuan throughout the year due to making fewer cardboard boxes.
    Where did the cardboard boxes go? April last year was the time when people discussed it most intensely. Users weighed each ream and counted each sheet when buying yellow printing paper. In this way, the mystery was revealed. It turned out that the new specification of No. 8 yellow printing paper had three fewer sheets per ream and 120 fewer sheets per ton. Many users thought the paper was being deducted somewhere, so they ran to Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company to ask for more paper. How could Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company provide the paper? Before this, Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company had received a notice from the Shanghai Purchasing Station of China Cultural Goods Company, saying that the yellow printing paper had been changed to a new specification and needed to be explained to users. Attached to this notice was a comparison table of the new and old specifications of yellow printing paper. From this comparison table, it can be seen that after the commonly used No. 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 yellow printing papers were changed to the new specifications, the number of sheets decreased, and the weight of each sheet increased by several grams compared to the old specifications. After Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company explained the new specifications of yellow printing paper to users, there were many complaints. Some wrote letters, and some went directly to Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company to question: "There is a shortage of yellow printing paper in the market, and you have come up with a new specification... This is not only not in line with the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, but also encourages the imbalance of supply and demand of yellow printing paper in the market." They demanded the restoration of the old specifications of yellow printing paper. But what could Hangzhou Cultural Goods Company do? They didn't make the paper, and even they couldn't figure out why the old specifications were changed to the new specifications!
    The Paper Mill's Troubles
    "It seems that the paper mill is being original!" People's dissatisfaction turned to the paper mill. Since the new specifications of yellow printing paper appeared on the market, letters of complaint from various places about the change in specifications of yellow printing paper flew to the paper mill like snowflakes. In a thick book of opinion summaries at the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill, the dissatisfaction of users in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places with the change in specifications of yellow printing paper was densely recorded. They used many facts to illustrate the advantages of the old specifications, such as the large number of sheets and the appropriate thickness, and demanded the restoration of the old specifications.
    In fact, after the yellow printing paper was changed to the new specifications, the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill also felt very troubled. For example, the old specifications of yellow printing paper produced by this factory in the past were not only supplied for domestic use but also exported to the United Kingdom, Malaya, Singapore, and the South Seas Islands. In the second half of 1955, 1,000 tons were sold to Hong Kong alone each quarter, and in the first quarter of 1956, it increased to 1,600 tons; however, after changing to the new specifications in April 1956, only 130 tons were exported in April and May, resulting in a temporary backlog of export yellow printing paper. Hong Kong users complained that the new specifications of yellow printing paper had fewer sheets and did not want them. They urgently demanded that our country's paper mills restore the old specifications of yellow printing paper. When their request was agreed to, many users immediately pre-ordered 1,000 tons. For the sake of export, the paper industry authorities agreed to restore the old specifications for export yellow printing paper, but for domestic yellow printing paper, it was still required to be made according to the new specifications. Since then, the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill has been making both the old specifications of No. 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 yellow printing paper and the new specifications of the same numbers. Making both new and old specifications at the same time has caused many unnecessary troubles for the paper mill. People who walk into the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill can see that many jobs are done in two sets, which wastes both manpower and materials and is also prone to errors.
    The evaluation of the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill staff on the change in specifications of yellow printing paper is: "Only disadvantages and no advantages." They believe that if the change in specifications can increase production or save the country, even if there are greater difficulties and more troubles in production, they can be overcome happily, but the situation after the yellow printing paper was changed to the new specifications is the opposite. For example, the planned production of yellow printing paper for this factory in 1957 is 12,482 tons. If the new specifications of No. 8 yellow printing paper are made, each ton will produce 120 sheets less than the old specifications of No. 8 yellow printing paper. Thus, in terms of the number of sheets, the actual production will be 325 tons less throughout the year. If the paper mill is to make up for this deficiency and produce another 325 tons of yellow printing paper (regardless of whether the paper mill can produce it), in the case of very tight paper-making raw materials, 9,795 dan of straw raw materials alone will be needed. This is only the figure for one machine in one factory. If the figures for the increased raw materials of many paper mills across the country are added up, it will be even more alarming. No wonder people call the new specifications of yellow printing paper "reduced production specifications" and "wasteful specifications"!
    Where are the Benefits After All?
    The decision to change the old specifications of yellow printing paper to the new specifications was made by the Central Paper Industry Administration last year. Before changing the specifications, they did solicit opinions from the paper mills, but they did not adopt the opinions from below. Why did they change the specifications after all? In a letter replying to an inquirer on January 18 this year, the Central Paper Industry Administration said: The yellow printing paper used in our country's market in the past was the old specification left over from the United Kingdom, while the new specification was specified with reference to the Soviet standard. As for the market not welcoming the new specifications, this is a contradiction between new things and old things, and repeated explanations are needed. After reading this letter, one cannot be convinced. Because in our country's specific situation, where are the benefits of changing the specifications of yellow printing paper after all? No basic answer has been obtained.

### 黄版纸的张数为啥少了

　　黄版纸的张数为啥少了
　　本报记者　刘凡
    在杭州的食品商店里，顾客们买核桃糖、糕饼等食品的时候，总想要买个纸盒装着带走。这时候，人们经常会听到顾客和营业员之间这样的对话。
    “纸盒怎么比过去贵了？”
    “你还嫌贵，我们拿钞票还买不到货呢！”
    这种不愉快的对话真实地反映出市场上纸盒成本高和货源不足的情况。过去食品商店一只装一斤食品的纸盒，只卖三、四分钱，现在卖五分；一只二斤装的食品盒，过去只卖五、六分钱，现在要卖七分。至于装西药、腊纸、油墨、玻璃杯、皮鞋、剪刀、牙刷、钮扣等百多种商品的纸盒，价钱也提高了2.8％到8％。据杭州食品业统计，今年的业务虽比过去扩大了，但是2月份纸盒的供应量却比去年同期减少了20％。
    纸盒哪里去了？
    杭州有六个纸盒生产合作社。过去从中国文化用品公司杭州市公司（以下统称杭州市中文公司）进一吨八号黄版纸，可以制二斤装的食品盒一万六千五百只；从去年4月起，进一吨八号黄版纸只能制一万六千只。杭州红星纸盒生产合作社，去年3月和今年3月同样做六吨半八号黄版纸，但做的二斤装的盒子却少了二千九百只。以每只出售六分钱计算，社里每月就少收入一百七十四元。全社六十七个社员，每个社员每月少收入二元多。吃亏的当然不止一家。规模不大的新华腊纸厂，全年因为少做纸盒，就使成本增加了一千二百多元。
    纸盒子到哪里去了？去年4月间，是人们议论得最热烈的时候。用户买黄版纸时一件一件地过磅，一张一张地数。这样，谜底才给揭开了。原来，新规格的八号黄版纸一令少了三张，一吨少了一百二十张。许多用户以为纸张少了是什么地方扣去了，于是纷纷跑到杭州市中文公司去补纸张。杭州市中文公司怎么拿得出纸呢？在这以前，杭州市中文公司曾经接到中国文化用品公司上海采购站一个通知，说黄版纸改了新规格，需要向用户进行宣传解释。在这个通知后面还附了一张黄版纸新规格和老规格的对照表，从这张对照表上可以看出：常用的八、十、十二、十四、十六等号的黄版纸，改成新规格以后，张数减少了，每张纸的重量比老规格的增加了几克。当杭州市中文公司将黄版纸的新规格向用户说明以后，用户意见很多。有的写信，有的就直接跑到杭州市中文公司提出责问：“市场上黄版纸缺得慌，你们反而来了个新规格……这不仅不合乎增产节约原则，而且还助长了市场上黄版纸的供不应求。”他们要求恢复黄版纸的老规格。可是杭州市中文公司又有什么办法呢？纸又不是他们造的，连他们自己也弄不明白老规格为什么要改成新规格啊！
    纸厂的苦恼
    “看来，这是造纸厂在独出心裁！”人们不满意的情绪转向造纸厂。自从新规格的黄版纸在市场上出现以后，各地对黄版纸改变规格的意见信像雪片似地飞向造纸工厂。在杭州华丰造纸厂的一本厚厚的意见摘要簿上，密密麻麻地记载了上海、江苏、浙江等地用户对黄版纸改变规格的不满的意见。他们用许多事实说明老规格张数多、厚度适当等好处，要求恢复老规格。
    其实，黄版纸改变规格以后，杭州华丰造纸厂也感到很苦恼。例如，这个厂过去出产的老规格黄版纸，除了供应国内使用以外，还要外销到英国、马来亚、新加坡、南洋群岛一带。1955年下半年，每季单是销到香港的就有一千吨，1956年第一季度还增加到一千六百吨；但是，从1956年4月改为新规格以后，4、5两月只外销了一百三十吨，一时形成了外销黄版纸库存积压。香港用户嫌新规格黄版纸的张数少，不愿意要。他们迫切要求我国造纸厂恢复老规格的黄版纸。当答应他们的要求以后，立即就有许多用户预订了一千吨。为了外销，造纸工业主管部门同意了外销黄版纸恢复老规格，但对内销黄版纸，仍旧要求按新规格做。从此，杭州华丰造纸厂一边做八、十、十二、十四、十六号的老规格黄版纸，一边又做同样号头的新规格黄版纸。新老规格同时做，给造纸厂造成了许多不必要的麻烦。人们走进杭州华丰造纸厂，就可以看到许多工作都是两套，既浪费了人力、物力，也很容易造成差错。
    杭州华丰造纸厂职工对黄版纸改变规格的评价是：“只有弊而没有利”。他们认为，若是改变了规格，能够使国家增产或者节约，在生产上有再大的困难、再多的麻烦也能愉快地去克服，可是黄版纸改为新规格以后的情况却相反。例如，这个厂1957年黄版纸计划产量是一万二千四百八十二吨，若做新规格的八号黄版纸，每吨比老规格的八号黄版纸少产一百二十张。这样按张数说，全年实际上少产三百二十五吨。假如纸厂为了弥补这个不足，再生产黄版纸三百二十五吨（暂且不论纸厂是否能生产），在造纸原料十分紧张的情况下，单稻草原料就需要多用九千七百九十五担。这仅是一个厂一台机器的数字，如果把全国许多造纸厂增加原料的数字统计起来，那就更为惊人了。怪不得人们把黄版纸的新规格说成是“减产规格”和“浪费规格”啊！
    好处到底在哪里？
    将黄版纸的老规格改为新规格，是去年中央造纸工业管理局决定的。在改变规格以前，他们虽然向纸厂征求了一下意见，但是没有采纳下面的意见。到底为什么要改变规格呢？中央造纸工业管理局在今年1月18日回复一个询问者的信上说：我国市场上过去所用的黄版纸是英国遗留下来的老规格，而新规格是参照苏联标准规定的。至于市场上不欢迎新规格，这是一个新事物和旧事物之间的矛盾，需要进行反复的解释。看了这封信，是不能令人信服的。因为在我国具体的情况下，黄版纸改变规格的好处到底在哪里？并没有得到起码的回答。
