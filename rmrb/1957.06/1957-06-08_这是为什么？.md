Why is This?

Lu Yuwen, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Assistant Secretary-General of the State Council, expressed some opinions that differed from others on May 25 at an enlarged meeting of the "Min Ge" Central Group when discussing how to help the Communist Party rectify its work. Consequently, someone wrote him an anonymous threatening letter. This letter stated: "We were very angry when we saw your speech at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Min Ge in the newspaper. We oppose your opinions, and we completely agree with Mr. Tan Tiwu's opinions. We believe that you are the 'typical example' of those shameless people that Mr. Tan referred to. You have now climbed to the lofty position of Assistant Secretary-General of the State Council. In the past, you put a lot of effort into creating walls and trenches between the Communist Party and non-Party members. Now you still dare to act as an accomplice of the tiger, which is extremely shameless. We warn you to turn back as soon as possible! Otherwise, the people will not forgive you!"

Such an incident occurring during the Communist Party's rectification movement is of great significance. Everyone should think about: What is the reason for this?

What did Lu Yuwen say in his speech on May 25? To summarize, firstly, he told people not to confuse bourgeois democracy with socialist democracy, and not to weaken or abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. Secondly, he said that the State Council should have prepared documents in advance for meetings so that discussions could take place, and that avoiding daily arguments and indecisiveness like a parliament in a bourgeois country should not be considered formalism or preventing everyone from discussing things. Thirdly, he said that he himself got along very well with Communist Party members, and that there were no walls or trenches between them. If some people had walls and trenches between themselves and Party members, they should be "demolished and filled from both sides," and both sides should take the initiative. Fourthly, he said that Communists could refute certain criticisms, and that such refutations should not be regarded as retaliation or attacks. Fifthly, he offered some concrete suggestions on how non-Party members could achieve positions with authority and responsibility. We, like many readers, cannot help but ask: Why are such realistic and approachable opinions considered "acting as an accomplice of the tiger" and "extremely shameless"? Why should one "turn back as soon as possible," otherwise one would "not be forgiven"?

To say that Lu Yuwen's speech was "acting as an accomplice of the tiger" means that the Communist Party is, of course, the "tiger" in the eyes of the letter writer. When the Communist Party led the Chinese people in fighting against the Chinese people's mortal enemies, imperialism and feudal forces, it was indeed as brave as a tiger, and no force could make it fear or yield. But for the Chinese people, the Communist Party is the best friend: it helped the people overthrow the counter-revolutionary forces that were oppressing them, helped the people recover land, factories, and other means of production, freed the people from the cruel oppression of the exploiting classes, put their historical destiny in their own hands, and is now advancing towards the great goal of a prosperous and happy socialist and communist society. The vast majority of people have never been so full of bright hope and joy of life as in the era of the Communist Party's leadership. The Communist Party has also made mistakes and has shortcomings, and the Communist Party's rectification movement is precisely aimed at correcting these mistakes and shortcomings. All those who have goodwill towards the Party and the socialist cause are actively offering opinions to help the Communist Party rectify its work, so as to strengthen the socialist cause and consolidate the Party's leadership over the masses. At such a time, some people are calling statements that defend socialist democracy and the leadership of the Communist Party "extremely shameless" and "acting as an accomplice of the tiger," and comparing Communists to terrible, man-eating "tigers." Can the political faces of such people not arouse people's vigilance? These people warn Lu Yuwen to "turn back as soon as possible." Please think about what they mean by "turning back" to where? Of course, these people will also say elsewhere, in words, how they truly support socialism and the Communist Party, and so on. But can one really believe that people who are so hostile to the vanguard of the working people are helping the Communist Party rectify its work, or are supporting the socialist cause?

We believe that this threatening letter is a major event in current political life because it is indeed a warning to the broad masses of people, a signal that some people are using the Party's rectification movement to carry out a sharp class struggle. This letter tells us that although the large-scale class struggle in the country has passed, the class struggle has not died out, especially on the ideological front. He Xiangning, a veteran revolutionary, put it well: "Today is a new era. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we are embarking on socialism. Does this mean that in this era, everything will be uniform, and there will no longer be left, center, and right? No, there won't be." She pointed out that a very small number of people are insincere about socialism and actually yearn for capitalism in their hearts, and their minds are filled with illusions of European and American-style politics. These people are today's rightists. Under the guise of "helping the Communist Party rectify its work," a small number of rightists are challenging the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, and even openly clamoring for the Communist Party to "step down." They are attempting to use this opportunity to overthrow the Communist Party and the working class, to overthrow the great cause of socialism, and to drag history backwards, back to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and actually back to the semi-colonial status before the victory of the revolution, placing the Chinese people once again under the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs. But they have forgotten that today's China is not the China of the past. The vast majority of the people will never allow history to be reversed. In all places across the country where rectification movements are being carried out, these rightists are trying to use the rectification movement to isolate the Communist Party and those who support socialism. As a result, it is they themselves who are truly isolated. Among the various democratic parties and senior intellectuals, a small number of rightists, as Lu Yuwen said, still want to use insults and threats, "putting on a 'fair' attitude to stifle" people's speech, and even resorting to writing threatening letters to achieve their goals. But isn't all this going too far? Extremes beget opposites. Don't they understand this truth?

Very clearly, although some people are calling for the Communist Party to "step down," and some are writing threatening letters to those who support the Communist Party, these will not cause any wavering in the Communist Party and the masses of people. The Communist Party will continue to rectify its work, and will continue to listen to all well-intentioned criticisms from non-Party members. The masses of people will also continue to adhere to the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party. Those threats and insults only remind us that in our country, the class struggle is still going on, and we must use the viewpoint of class struggle to observe the various phenomena of the present and draw the correct conclusions.

### 这是为什么？

    这是为什么？
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员、国务院秘书长助理卢郁文因为5月25日在“民革”中央小组扩大会议上讨论怎样帮助共产党整风的时候，发表了一些与别人不同的意见，就有人写了匿名来信恐吓他。这封信说：“在报上看到你在民革中央扩大会议上的发言，我们十分气愤。我们反对你的意见，我们完全同意谭惕吾先生的意见。我们觉得：你就是谭先生所指的那些无耻之徒的‘典型’。你现在已经爬到国务院秘书长助理的宝座了。你在过去，在制造共产党与党外人士的墙和沟上是出了不少力量的，现在还敢为虎作伥，真是无耻之尤。我们警告你，及早回头吧！不然人民不会饶恕你的！”
    在共产党的整风运动中，竟发生这样的事件，它的意义十分严重。每个人都应该想一想：这究竟是为什么？
    卢郁文在5月25日的发言中讲了些什么呢？归纳起来，一是告诉人们不要混淆资产阶级民主和社会主义民主，不要削弱和取消共产党的领导；二是说国务院开会时应该有事先准备好的文件，以便讨论，免得像资产阶级国家的议会一样每天争吵，议而不决，不能说就是形式主义，就是不让大家讨论；三是说他自己同共产党员相处得很融洽，中间没有墙和沟；如果有些人和党员中间有了墙和沟，应该“从两面拆、填”，双方都要主动；四是说共产党人对某些批评可以辩驳，这种辩驳不能认为是报复打击；五是对党外人士如何实现有职有权的问题提供了一些具体意见。我们和许多读者一样不能不问：发表这样实事求是、平易近人的意见，为什么就是“为虎作伥”，“无耻之尤”？为什么要“及早回头”，否则就“不会饶恕你”？
    把卢郁文的发言说成“为虎作伥”，共产党当然就是写信者们心目中的“老虎”了。共产党在领导中国人民对中国人民的死敌帝国主义和封建势力作战的时候，的确和老虎一样勇猛，没有任何力量可以使它畏惧，屈服。但对中国人民来说，共产党却是最好的朋友：它帮助人民推翻了压着人民身上的反革命势力，帮助人民收回了土地、工厂等生产资料，使人民摆脱了剥削阶级的残酷压榨，把自己的历史命运掌握在自己手里，现在正朝着人民富裕、人民幸福的社会主义和共产主义的远大目标迈进。最广大的人民从来没有像在共产党领导的时代这样充满光明的希望和生的乐趣。共产党也犯过错误，也有缺点，共产党的整风运动正是要整掉这些错误和缺点。一切对党和社会主义事业抱有善意的人们，都在积极地提意见帮助共产党整风，以便加强社会主义事业，巩固党对于人民群众的领导。在这样的时候，却有人把维护社会主义民主、维护共产党的领导权的言论称为“无耻之尤”，“为虎作伥”，把共产党人比作可怕的吃人的“老虎”。这种人的政治面目，难道还能不引起人们的警惕么？这些人警告卢郁文“及早回头”，请想想他们所说的，究竟是向什么地方“回头”？当然，这些人在另外的地方，口头上也会说他们怎样才是真正拥护社会主义，拥护共产党云云。但是，难道还能相信对劳动人民的先锋队如此仇视的人们，是在那里帮助共产党整风，是在那里拥护社会主义事业么？
    我们所以认为这封恐吓信是当前政治生活中的一个重大事件，因为这封信的确是对于广大人民的一个警告，是某些人利用党的整风运动进行尖锐的阶级斗争的信号。这封信告诉我们：国内大规模的阶级斗争虽然已经过去了，但是阶级斗争并没有熄灭，在思想战线上尤其是如此。革命的老前辈何香凝先生说得好：“今天是新时代了，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们走上社会主义。难道在这个时代，也就一切都是清一色，再也不会有左、中、右了吗？不会的。”她指出，有极少数人对社会主义是口是心非，心里向往的其实是资本主义，脑子里憧憬的是欧美式的政治，这些人就是今天的右派。在“帮助共产党整风”的名义之下，少数的右派分子正在向共产党和工人阶级的领导权挑战，甚至公然叫嚣要共产党“下台”。他们企图乘此时机把共产党和工人阶级打翻，把社会主义的伟大事业打翻，拉着历史向后倒退，退到资产阶级专政，实际是退到革命胜利以前的半殖民地地位，把中国人民重新放在帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治之下。可是他们忘记了，今天的中国已经不是以前的中国，要想使历史倒退，最广大的人民是决不许可的。在全国一切进行整风运动的地方，这些右派分子都想利用整风运动使共产党孤立，想使拥护社会主义的人孤立，结果真正孤立的却是他们自己。在各民主党派和高级知识分子中，有少数右派分子像卢郁文所说，还想利用辱骂，威胁，“装出‘公正’的态度来箝制”人们的言论，甚至采取写恐吓信的手段来达到自己的目的。但是这一切岂不是做得太过分了吗？物极必反，他们难道不懂得这个真理吗？
    非常明显，尽管有人叫共产党“下台”，有人向拥护共产党的人写恐吓信，这些决不会使共产党和人民群众发生任何动摇。共产党仍然要整风，仍然要倾听党外人士的一切善意批评，而人民群众也仍然要在共产党的领导下坚持社会主义的道路。那些威胁和辱骂，只是提醒我们，在我们的国家里，阶级斗争还在进行着，我们还必须用阶级斗争的观点来观察当前的种种现象，并且得出正确的结论。
