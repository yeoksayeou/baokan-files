　　On the Role of the Han Language in the Languages of Minority Nationalities
　　Bao Erhan, Director of the Institute of Minority Languages, Chinese Academy of Sciences

　　In our great motherland, the People's Republic of China, more than forty minority nationalities live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Tibet (Autonomous Region), and the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Gansu, and Heilongjiang. They each have their own national languages. Their customs, lifestyles, and levels of cultural development are all different. Because the Kuomintang reactionaries not only failed to provide any assistance for their political, economic, and cultural development, but also caused the cultures of nationalities with a relatively high level of culture in history to regress. Therefore, after liberation, there emerged de facto inequalities between the nationalities left over from the reactionary regime.

　　These nationalities, who were in a state of inequality and oppression under the reactionary government in the past, have become nationalities with full and equal rights after liberation. From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, national oppression was declared over. Therefore, the People's Republic of China has become a large family of free, equal, friendly, and cooperative nationalities. The preamble to the Constitution states: "...on the basis of promoting friendship and mutual assistance among the nationalities, opposing imperialism, opposing the enemies of the people within all nationalities, and opposing Han chauvinism and local nationalism, the unity of our nationalities will continue to be strengthened..."

　　Chairman Mao Zedong once said: The Chinese Communists "must help the broad masses of the minority nationalities, including all leading figures who are connected with the masses, to strive for their liberation and development in politics, economy, and culture, and to establish their own armies of minority nationalities to protect the interests of the masses. Their languages, scripts, customs, habits, and religious beliefs should be respected" (note).

　　In order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions, much work has been done and is being done under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central People's Government. Many concrete measures are being taken to eliminate the de facto inequalities between the nationalities left over from history. Minority nationality areas have seen tremendous development in economic and cultural construction, and in areas where socialist transformation has been implemented, national relations have become socialist national relations.

　　Some nationalities formerly used their own national scripts, which are no longer suitable for the needs of social development today. In order to help them reform, and to create scripts for more than twenty nationalities that have never had scripts, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has established the Institute of Minority Languages.

　　Last year, the Institute of Minority Languages, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and related units jointly organized seven survey teams, including seven hundred people, to go to various provinces, including Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Gansu, and Heilongjiang, and the Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions to conduct academic surveys of the languages of the nationalities. Last year, they helped fourteen nationalities create scripts (alphabets) and helped nationalities with existing scripts reform their scripts. Some nationalities already have scripts that they used in the past, but they cannot meet the current needs, so the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to replace the original Mongolian script with the Slavic alphabet, and some nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have also decided to switch to the Slavic alphabet. However, in reforming these scripts, there are still various different opinions within these nationalities that have not been fully agreed upon. In particular, the majority of the people in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region believe in Islam, and most countries in the world that believe in Islam use the Arabic alphabet. Therefore, some people believe that the adoption of the Slavic alphabet cannot but involve religious issues and cannot but cause internal contradictions. In order to solve this problem, they advocate that it is necessary to first carry out extensive propaganda among the broad masses, hold forums, and conduct ideological education to basically unify everyone's opinions; on the other hand, when adopting this new script, it is necessary to observe its possible adverse effects on the outside world. Therefore, this matter should not be rushed, but should be carried out steadily. We are basing the new alphabets we have already developed and are developing for minority nationalities in the southwest on the Latin alphabet. At the same time, a special academic committee has done long-term work, conducted academic surveys and discussions, and is preparing to publish the new alphabet scheme, which has been basically completed, in the near future.

　　Among the six hundred million people living in our great motherland, 94% are Han, and the remaining 6% are composed of more than forty minority nationalities. The minority nationalities, who are combined with the Han people into a whole country under geographical, historical, and economic conditions, in order to reduce the difficulty of learning Chinese characters, facilitate mutual exchange of culture, and consolidate friendship between nationalities, are faced with the question of what direction they should take in developing their languages and scripts. This question is worthy of serious consideration by all parties.

　　As everyone knows, after the great October Socialist Revolution, the minority nationalities of the Soviet Union joined socialist society under the leadership and assistance of the great Russian nation. They united as socialist nations and created a new socialist culture. Because after class hatred and national oppression are fundamentally eliminated, there is only national form, socialist content of national culture. The bourgeois nation under private property and capitalist rule divides the relations between nationalities, creates national hatred, and even causes national killings. It cannot have a unified national culture. The socialist nation is a nation of patriotism and internationalism, which can promote friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation between nationalities, and pay attention to and respect the interests of other nationalities. Their cultures, arts, and academics are all mutually influenced, mutually learned, and mutually exchanged. Therefore, in socialist society, the culture of one nation can enrich the content of the culture, art, literature, and language of another nation. The nationalities of the Soviet Union mutually influence and enrich their national cultures. This not only plays a role within the Soviet Union, but also affects the people of the socialist camp around the world to learn from each other and exchange with each other. The socialist nations of all countries turn all the cultures with socialist content into their own national forms to enrich their national cultures. We must learn from the advanced culture and advanced experience of the Soviet Union. But we should not mechanically move its form and add it in, but we must learn its content and combine its content with our own actual situation.

　　"Language is a tool, a weapon, which people use to communicate with each other, exchange ideas, and achieve mutual understanding." (J. Stalin, "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics") The larger nationalities in a country, where nationalities are combined due to geographical and historical conditions, have a greater impact on material, culture, and language, and even the national distinctions of some nationalities disappear because of this. This material and cultural influence is even faster than linguistic changes. Language changes with changes in material, culture, and living habits. If we look at the influence and connections of the Han language on other nationalities, we can see the profound influence of the minority languages in the southwestern provinces of our country. The same is true for the northwestern provinces and autonomous regions. For example, in the Dongxiang ethnic group, 2,105 words were surveyed, and Chinese loanwords accounted for 45%. In the Bonan ethnic group, 1,220 words were surveyed, and Chinese loanwords accounted for 40.5%. We can also find many modern Han languages from the languages of Uygur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and other nationalities. Chinese such as "中国" (China), "毛主席" (Chairman Mao), "委员长" (Chairman), "总理" (Premier), "国务院" (State Council), "电报" (telegram), "代表" (representative) are easier to understand than "Председатель Мао," "Пре-мьер—Министр," "Депутат."

　　The Han language has a great influence on the languages of minority nationalities. Because only in the Mao Zedong era did they have the possibility of fully developing national forms and socialist content culture, and opened up the way to improve their own literary and artistic vocabulary. Now many minority nationalities are borrowing vocabulary related to politics and social sciences from Chinese. Some of these are words borrowed from Chinese over hundreds of years, and some are words borrowed from Chinese in modern times, especially after liberation. Doing so can accelerate their development even more. Doing so will not eliminate the native languages of minority nationalities, but will enrich their languages even more. Because the components of vocabulary are not language, but "building materials of language" (Stalin). At the same time, this will further consolidate the friendship and cooperation between minority nationalities and the Han people. The levels of political, economic, and cultural development of minority nationalities are not the same. They are now in a period of building a socialist society under the fraternal assistance and leadership of the great Han people. It is of great significance for minority nationalities to learn the Han language and script and borrow some vocabulary that is not available in their native languages from it to develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings. Because each minority nationality has its own language, it is impossible for one person to understand the languages of more than forty nationalities. In this case, these nationalities need a second language in order to communicate with each other, understand and exchange cultures, and jointly build a socialist society. In our country, besides the most widely used common Han language, what other language can be used as their second language? Of course, our minority nationalities should learn and use the Han language used by 560 million people as the second language in our motherland's big family. The vocabulary that is lacking in the native language can be borrowed from each other. Such borrowing of Chinese vocabulary adapts to the linguistic rules of the people of all nationalities. Only in this way can we help enrich national languages, national literature, and national art in the cause of building socialism. In a period when conditions have been created for the development of national languages, it is very meaningful to see a more in-depth study of the Han language and script. And doing so shows that all kinds of flowers, irrigated by the hot blood shed by millions of people for liberation and freedom for a long time, have grown up.

　　Taking the spirit of patriotism and internationalism as the ideological basis for the fraternal cooperation between all nationalities, resolutely fighting against Han chauvinism and local nationalism left over from the old society, and striving to strengthen the iron-like friendship and cooperation between all nationalities are the glorious tasks of the members of our great People's Republic of China family.

　　关于汉族语言对少数民族语文的作用
　　中国科学院少数民族语言研究所所长  包尔汉
    在我们伟大祖国——中华人民共和国的内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、西藏（自治区）和广东、广西、贵州、四川、湖南、湖北、青海、甘肃、黑龙江等省生活着四十多个少数民族。他们各自都有本民族的语言。他们的风俗习惯、生活方式和文化发展的程度都不相同。因为，过去国民党反动派不但对他们的政治、经济和文化的发展不给予任何帮助，而且使历史上文化程度相当高的民族的文化反而落后了。因此，解放后各民族之间就出现了反动政权所遗留下来的事实上的不平等。
    过去在反动政府时代处在不平等和被压迫之下的这些民族，解放以后完全成为拥有充分平等权利的民族了。从中华人民共和国成立的那一天起，民族压迫就宣告结束。因而，中华人民共和国便成了各民族自由平等的友爱合作大家庭。宪法的序言中指出：“……在发扬各民族间的友爱互助、反对帝国主义、反对各民族内部的人民公敌、反对大民族主义和地方民族主义的基础上，我国的民族团结将继续加强……”。
    毛泽东主席曾说：中国共产党人“必须帮助各少数民族的广大人民群众，包括一切联系群众的领袖人物在内，争取他们在政治上、经济上、文化上的解放和发展，并成立维护群众利益的少数民族自己的军队。他们的语言、文字、风俗、习惯和宗教信仰，应被尊重”（注）。
    为了执行毛主席这一指示，在中共中央和中央人民政府领导下已经做了并且正在做着许多工作。为了消除历史上遗留下来的各民族之间事实上的不平等，正在采取许多具体办法。少数民族地区在经济与文化建设上已有了巨大发展，在实行了社会主义改造的地区，民族关系已经变为社会主义的民族关系了。
    有些民族以往采用的本民族的文字，今天已经不适合社会发展的要求，为了帮助他们进行改革，并替向来没有文字的二十多个民族创立文字，中国科学院已经成立了少数民族语言研究所。
    去年少数民族语言研究所和中央民族学院以及有关单位会同组织了包括七百人的七个调查队，前往广西、广东、云南、贵州、四川、湖南、湖北、青海、甘肃、黑龙江各省和西藏、内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区等处，对各民族的语言进行学术性的调查。去年帮助十四个民族创立了文字（字母），并帮助已有文字的民族改革了文字。有些民族虽然已经有过去采用的文字，但是不能满足现在的需要，所以内蒙古自治区已决定用斯拉夫字母代替原来的蒙文，新疆维吾尔自治区有些民族也决定改用斯拉夫字母。但是在改革这些文字方面，这些民族里面还有着未能充分达到一致的各种不同的意见。特别是新疆维吾尔自治区人民大多数是信仰伊斯兰教的，而世界上信仰伊斯兰教的国家大多采用阿拉伯字母，因此，有人考虑到采用斯拉夫字母不能不牵涉到宗教问题，不能不发生内部矛盾。为了解决这个问题，他们主张必须先在广大群众中进行广泛的宣传，举行座谈会，进行思想教育，使大家的意见基本上趋于一致；另方面，采用这个新文字时应该观察它对外界可能发生的不良影响。因此，对此事不可过急，要稳步进行。我们基于拉丁字母给西南地区各少数民族已经新制定和正在制定字母。同时有专门的学术委员会做了长期的工作进行了学术调查和讨论，准备不久的将来把业已基本上完成的新的字母方案公布出来。
    在我们伟大祖国生活着的六亿人民中94％是汉族，其余6％是包括四十多个少数民族组成的。在地理、历史和经济条件下和汉族人民共同结合成为一个整个国家的各少数民族，为着减少学习汉字的困难，便于互相交流文化、巩固民族间友谊，则在他们的面前摆着在发展他们的语言文字方面，应该采取什么方向的问题。这个问题是值得各方面加以认真考虑的。
    大家知道，在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，苏联各少数民族在伟大的俄罗斯民族带领和帮助之下加入了社会主义社会。作为社会主义民族联合起来，创立了社会主义的新文化。因为在阶级仇恨和民族压迫从根本上消除了之后就只有一个民族形式，社会主义内容的民族文化。在私人财产和资本统治下的资产阶级的民族，它分裂各民族的关系，制造民族仇恨甚至造成民族仇杀。它不可能有统一的民族文化。社会主义民族乃是爱国主义和国际主义的民族，它能促成民族间的友爱、互相帮助与合作，注意并尊重其他民族的利益。它们的文化、艺术、学术都是互相影响、互相学习、互相交流的。因此在社会主义社会中一个民族的文化却能丰富另一个民族的文化、艺术、文学和语言的内容。苏联各民族之间就是互相影响、互相丰富民族文化的。这不仅在苏联范围内起作用，而且还影响着全世界社会主义阵营的人民进行互相学习、互相交流，各国的社会主义民族把所有的社会主义内容的文化，变为自己民族的形式来丰富着本民族的文化，我们必须学习苏联这种先进的文化和先进的经验。但是并不是机械地把它的形式搬来加进去，而是要学习它的内容，把它的内容与我们自己的实际情况结合起来。
      “语言是工具、武器，人们利用它来互相交际，交流思想，达到互相了解。”（约·斯大林著“马克思主义与语言学问题”）由于地理和历史条件而结合成为一个国家的各民族，较大的民族在物质、文化与语言方面影响较大，甚至因此有些民族的民族区别都消失了，这种物质、文化的影响，比较语言上的变化也还要快些。语言是随着物质、文化和生活习惯的改变而改变的。如果我们以汉族语言对其他民族的影响和所发生的联系来看，就可以看出我国西南各省的少数民族语言所受到的深刻的影响。至于西北各省和自治区也是这样的。例如：在东乡族中调查了二千一百零五个词，汉语借词占45％，在保安族中调查了一千二百二十个词，汉语借词占40.5％。我们从维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古和其他各民族的语言中也可以找出许多现代汉族语言。“中国”“毛主席”“委员长”“总理”“国务院”“电报”“代表”等汉语比“Председатель  Мао”，“Пре-мьер—Министр”，“Депутат”更容易听懂。
    汉族语对少数民族语言有很大的影响。因为只有在毛泽东时代他们才有了充分发展民族形式社会主义内容文化的可能性，并为提高他们自己的文艺词汇开辟了道路。现在有许多少数民族都在借用汉语中有关政治、社会科学的词汇。其中有些是几百年以来、有些是近代特别是解放以后从汉语中借用的词汇。这样做能够更加加速它们的发展。这样做并不会消灭少数民族的本民族语言，而且会更加丰富它们的语言。因为词汇的成分并不是语言而是“语言的建筑材料”（斯大林）。这样同时会更加巩固少数民族和汉族人民之间的友谊合作。少数民族的政治、经济、文化的发展程度都不一致，他们现在正处在伟大的汉族人民兄弟般的帮助和率领下建设着社会主义社会的一个时期，少数民族学习汉族语言文字并从其中借用本民族语言不够用的一些词汇，对发展他们的政治、经济、文化事业是具有重大意义的。各少数民族因为都有本民族的语言，所以一个人能够懂得四十几个民族的语言是不可能的。既然这样，就需要有这些民族第二语言，以便互相交谈，了解和交流文化，共同建设社会主义社会。在我国除了最广泛使用的这样共同的汉族语言而外，还有那一种语言可以作为他们的第二语言呢？当然我们少数民族应该把五亿六千万人民使用的汉族语言当做我们祖国大家庭中的第二语言来学习和利用。本民族缺少的词汇可以互相借用。这样借用汉语词汇，适应于各族人民语言的规律。只有这样才能在建设社会主义的事业中对于丰富民族语言、民族文学和民族艺术等有所帮助。在这样为发展民族语言创设了条件的一个时期，能够看到更深入地学习汉族语文是非常有意义的一件事情。而这样做正表明长期以来为了解放和自由用成百万人所流的热血灌溉的各种鲜花都已成长起来了。
    以爱国主义和国际主义的精神作为各民族之间兄弟般的合作的思想基础，与旧社会所遗留下来的大民族主义和地方民族主义作坚决的斗争，为加强各民族之间钢铁般的友谊合作而努力，这是我们伟大的中华人民共和国大家庭成员的光荣任务。
