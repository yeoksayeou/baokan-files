　　One Hundred Million Mu of Early Rice Grow Well Across the Country

　　(Our newspaper reports) According to the agricultural departments' judgment based on the current situation: the approximately one hundred million mu of early rice in the southern regions are generally growing well, with only 20% not as good as last year. There are still twenty to thirty days until the early rice harvest. During this period, waterlogging and typhoons are still possible, and farmers in many areas are stepping up their efforts to prevent natural disasters.

　　There are many areas where a bumper harvest of early rice is expected. According to the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Department's estimate based on the three million mu of early rice that is currently flowering and heading, the total output of early rice this year may exceed last year's. The more than sixteen million mu of early rice in Zhejiang Province are also growing well, and farmers are carrying out the second weeding of the large area of double-cropping early rice. The more than eighteen million mu of early rice in Jiangxi are uniform and tidy, a lush green, and growing better than in previous years. In Fujian Province, 70%-80% of the seven million two hundred thousand mu of early rice are growing normally, and 90% of the seven hundred ninety thousand mu of double-cropping early rice in the northern part of the province are growing very well, with the earlier planted rice already heading. The three million eight hundred thousand mu of early rice in the Changde area of Dongting Lake, known as the "granary of the motherland," have already sprouted and closed, and a bumper harvest is expected. In Liling County, Hunan Province, a famous double-cropping rice area, more and more of the six hundred thirty thousand mu of early rice are in the stage of strong booting and heading. According to local experienced farmers, this year's early rice can produce more than six hundred catties of grain per mu.

　　Since June, some rivers in Guangdong Province have continuously experienced flood peaks, and large areas of early rice may be affected. In Fujian Province, 20%-30% of the early rice is not growing as well as last year. Pests have been found in some areas, and some areas have been affected by floods. Parts of Zhejiang Province have experienced drought. Farmers in these areas are fighting these natural disasters, and some areas have achieved remarkable results. Of the more than three million mu of dryland rice affected by the disaster in Guangdong, most have been saved to ensure a certain yield, with only 10% beyond recovery.

　　The early rice in Lehui and Qiongdong counties on Hainan Island has already been harvested, with an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. The early rice in the subtropical regions of Yunnan has also had a bumper harvest, with an average yield of four hundred fifty catties per mu in Yuanjiang County, an increase of about 10% compared to last year.

　　全国一亿亩早稻长得好
    本报讯　据农业部门根据现有的情况判断：南方地区的一亿亩左右早稻，一般生长良好，只有20％不如去年。目前到早稻收获还有二、三十天，在这个期间里，水和台风仍有出现的可能，许多地区的农民正在加紧防范自然灾害的工作。
    早稻可望丰收的地区是不少的。广东省农业部门根据三千万亩正在扬花抽穗的早稻预计，今年早稻的总产量可以超过去年。浙江省的一千六百多万亩早稻也生长的不错，农民们正在为大面积的双季早稻进行第二遍耘田。江西一千八百多万亩早稻均匀整齐，一片青葱，生长良好程度胜过往年。福建省的七百二十万早稻有70％—80％生长正常，这个省北部地区的七十九万亩双季早稻90％生长很好，早插的已经抽穗。“祖国谷仓”——洞庭湖滨的长德专区的三百八十多万亩早稻已经发兜封行，可望丰收。湖南省著名的双季稻区醴陵县的六十三万亩早稻，壮苞抽穗的越来越多了。据当地老农估计，今年的早稻，每亩可产谷六百斤以上。
    6月份以来广东省的一些河流不断出现洪峰，大面积的早稻有被侵袭的可能；福建省有20％—30％的早稻生长不如去年，一些地区的早稻发现害虫，部分地区受到洪水；浙江省部分地区发生干旱。这些地区的农民正在向这些自然灾害作斗争，有的地区并获得显著的成果。广东受灾的三百多万亩旱稻，经过抢救大部保住一定收成，无法挽救的只有10％。
    海南岛乐会、琼东两县的早稻已经收割，比去年增产20％以上。云南亚热带地区的早稻也获丰收，元江县的早稻平均亩产四百五十斤，比去年增产一成左右。
