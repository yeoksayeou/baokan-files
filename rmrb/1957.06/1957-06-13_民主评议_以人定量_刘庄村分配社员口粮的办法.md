　　Democratic Appraisal, Rationing by Individual
　　——The Method of Distributing Food Rations to Commune Members in Liuzhuang Village
　　Sun Dezeng
    Liuzhuang Village has three production teams, forty-nine households, and two hundred and ten people. It is a more populous production team under the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Tangzhuang Township, Fangcheng County, Henan Province. Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the food grain for commune members has been distributed equally based on the grain retention standards of the "three fixed" policy, according to the number of people in each household, regardless of age. As a result, households with many children and weak labor often could not finish their rations, while households with many adults and strong labor did not have enough; they exceeded the fixed amount of grain every summer and autumn, and experienced food shortages in the spring. Not long ago, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed the method of "rationing by individual based on the actual needs of age and labor strength according to the 'three fixed' grain retention standards." Most commune members and cadres expressed their support, but households with many children were afraid of being at a disadvantage and that reducing the amount too much would not be enough, so they advocated continuing the old method. A few cadres were afraid that inaccurate individual rationing would cause disputes among commune members, and suggested deducting a small portion of reserve grain within the team to subsidize labor and big eaters. They thought this was simple and convenient. Some production teams with many children believed that "there are too many people talking in the team's appraisal," and advocated distributing grain to the teams according to the "three fixed" retention amount, with mutual adjustment within the teams. Which method is better? The team committee believed that this was a major issue related to the state's grain policy and the lives of commune members, and decided to submit it to the commune member congress for discussion and decision.
    The team committee first explained the state's grain policy in detail to the commune members, and then introduced the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, allowing everyone to democratically discuss and decide on the distribution method based on the principles of benefiting production, benefiting unity, and benefiting grain conservation.
    The grain retained by the state for commune members is generally said to be sufficient, but why do food shortages occur every spring? Everyone first discussed this issue and analyzed which households were experiencing shortages. After discussion and comparative analysis, the commune members unanimously agreed that this was entirely caused by average grain retention. Take last year as an example. More than a dozen households in the team with many children and weak labor still had some leftover grain this spring. Four households even gave their leftover grain to relatives and friends, and five households sold sweet potatoes; however, more than a dozen households with many adults and strong labor were short of grain this spring, and the state sold more than a thousand catties of grain to them. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient grain, twelve laborers went out to pick sweet potatoes and buy sweet potato chips, some for as long as half a year, and some for as short as a month, which directly affected production and reduced the income of the agricultural cooperative. In addition, the strong laborers were often dissatisfied with the average grain retention and often complained about the households with many children who were short of grain; the households short of grain were also very depressed because they often heard "second opinions," and their production enthusiasm was negative. For example, when grain was distributed last autumn, Zuo Chunde's family, which had many children, received the same amount of grain for a newborn baby as Chen Jinyou, a strong single man. Chen Jinyou was so angry that he did not participate in production for five days and had a fight with Zuo Chunde. After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that implementing the method of individual rationing of grain not only conformed to the spirit of conserving grain, but was also beneficial to developing production and strengthening unity among commune members.
    Should mutual adjustment be based on the cooperative, the team, or the group? If it is based on the team, the proportion of children and adults in each team is generally not very different, but if it is based on the group, the difference is much larger. They calculated an account for the second and third production teams. The second group has many children, and each laborer can receive an average of 520 catties of grain, while the third group has few children, and each laborer can only receive an average of 413 catties of grain. If adjustment is based on the group, the role of individual rationing cannot be fully utilized, and the contradiction between commune members' grain consumption cannot be resolved. Therefore, it was decided to adjust and distribute based on the team and on individual rationing.
    How to ration? This is the issue that commune members are most concerned about and is also very complicated. According to the requirements of the commune members, they first convened an expanded team committee, absorbing representatives of commune members from different types of households, and also hired several experienced middle-aged women who were experienced in managing household affairs and allocating grain as consultants. First, based on the actual situation of age and labor strength, and adhering to the principle of eating more and distributing more, eating less and distributing less, the actual grain consumption of different people was analyzed and studied, divided into grades and levels, and the general grain consumption standards for each level were proposed for discussion at the commune member congress. The specific method is as follows:
    Determination of grades: Based on the age and actual grain consumption of the commune members, a total of six grades were divided. Children who do not eat grain or eat very little grain under one year old are in the first grade; children aged two to five do not participate in labor, and generally the amount of grain eaten by two children is equal to the amount eaten by a strong laborer, and are classified as the second grade; children aged six to ten, except for students, a few also participate in physical labor, and their grain consumption accounts for about 70% of the grain consumption of a strong laborer, and are classified as the third grade; children aged eleven to fifteen mostly participate in physical labor, and their grain consumption is only slightly lower than that of adults, and are classified as the fourth grade; some elderly people who cannot participate in physical labor consume about the same amount of grain as fifteen-year-old children, and are also classified as the fourth grade; working men and women, young and middle-aged, are classified as the fifth grade. In view of the great impact of physical strength on grain consumption, after discussion by commune members, it was decided to divide labor into strong and weak grades and give different subsidies. Single men are given special consideration because they live independently and consume more grain, and no separate grade is assigned to them. According to the above principles, the population of the entire team was registered household by household and person by person according to age.
    Determination of the general grain consumption standard for each grade: The biggest dispute in this was: (1) The difference in grain retention between children and laborers. Because the laborer's subsidy grain is deducted from the child's retention amount, households with many children said "laborers can distribute more increased production grain," and advocated deducting less within the "three fixed" retention amount stipulated by the state; while households with strong laborers and many adults said "increased production grain is uncertain," and advocated retaining as much as they use. Finally, after discussion, it was decided to take care of both children and laborers, both the elderly and the young, and to see both increased production and reduced production. In short, the principle is to meet the actual grain consumption of the commune members, and children can retain enough according to their actual needs. The specific regulations are that the general grain consumption standard for each person in the first grade is 100 catties, 250 catties for the second grade, 320 catties for the third grade, 380 catties for the fourth grade, and single men are subsidized another 30 catties per person. (2) The age difference: There are many actual ages between the ages in each grade, especially between the lowest age of the upper grade and the highest age of the lower grade, that differ by only a few months, but the grain retention standard differs by more than 100 catties. To solve this problem, the grain retention range for each grade must be expanded. The specific regulation is that under the principle of not exceeding the "three fixed" retention amount, each grade has a maximum standard and a minimum standard in addition to the general standard. For example, the general retention standard for the second grade is 250 catties, the minimum standard is 200 catties, and the maximum is 280 catties; (3) The difference between participating in labor and not participating in labor: Some women should be treated as laborers according to their age, but their housework is not busy, and they do not participate in physical labor (including housework) all year round, or cannot participate in labor due to illness. Everyone's opinion is that they can only be given the "three fixed" retention amount as it is and cannot enjoy the labor subsidy. Young men and women aged sixteen to eighteen are mainly evaluated individually according to their physical strength, grain consumption, and whether they participate in labor. For those who are physically weak, do not consume much grain, and do not participate in labor, they can also retain 380 catties of grain per person. (4) The difference between strong and weak labor: The situation is very complicated and it is difficult to mechanically stipulate standards. For example, commune member Quan Zhaofeng, although he is middle-aged, is physically weak and can only do light work, and everyone rated him as a weak laborer. Another example is commune member Lu Tongfu, although he is 69 years old, he is physically strong and consumes a lot of grain, so he is classified as a strong laborer.
    After the draft of grading and leveling was posted for public discussion and confirmed by the commune members, the total grain consumption of the entire team was calculated based on the actual amount reported by everyone. The entire team has 210 people. According to the "three fixed" policy, the annual grain retention standard per person is 380 catties, for a total of 79,800 catties. According to the individual rationing method, there are 121 people in grades one to four, for a total of 40,280 catties based on the general grain consumption standards for each grade. There are 48 strong laborers in the entire team, and the general annual grain requirement per person is 460 catties, for a total of 22,080 catties; there are 41 weak laborers, and the general grain requirement per person is 422 catties, for a total of 17,302 catties; the four single men are subsidized 30 catties per person, for a total of 120 catties. The total grain requirement for the above is 39,502 catties. As a result of individual rationing for the entire team, a total of 79,782 catties of grain is required, which is 18 catties less than the total amount of "three fixed" grain retention. After the distribution method was determined, the amount of grain retained by each household in the summer was determined according to a ratio of one-third.
    Due to the democratic appraisal conducted in a spirit of seeking truth from facts, the individual rationing work of this team was completed in only four days, achieving satisfaction from every household.

　　民主评议  以人定量
　　——刘庄村分配社员口粮的办法
　　孙德增
    刘庄村共有三个生产组，四十九户，二百一十口人，是河南省方城县唐庄乡第三农业生产合作社一个人口较多的生产队。从实行粮食统购统销以来，社员的食用粮都是根据三定政策的留粮标准，按照各户人口多少、不论年龄大小，平均分配的。实行结果，往往是小孩多、劳力弱的户吃不完，大人多、劳力强的户不够吃；年年夏秋两季吃粮超过定量，春季闹缺粮。不久以前，中共河南省委提出“根据三定留粮标准，按照年龄大小、劳力强弱的实际需要，以人定量”的办法以后，大部分社员和干部都表示拥护，但是小孩多的户既怕自己吃亏，又怕减量过多不够吃用，主张仍然按老办法执行。少数干部怕以人定量定的不准引起社员吵架，提议在队内少扣一部分机动粮，以少扣部分补助劳力和大肚汉。他们认为这样做简单省事。有的小孩多的生产组认为“队里评议，人多嘴杂”，主张粮食按三定留量分配到组，以组为单位互相调剂。究竟采用那种办法好呢？队务委员会认为这是关系到国家粮食政策与社员生活的大事情，决定提交社员大会讨论决定。
    队委会首先向社员们详细讲解了国家的粮食政策，又介绍了各种办法的好处和坏处，让大家从有利生产、有利团结、有利节约粮食的原则出发，民主讨论决定分配办法。
    国家给社员的留粮一般说是够吃用的，但是，为什么会年年春季闹缺粮呢？大家首先讨论这个问题，并分析缺粮的都是哪些户。经过讨论和分析对比，社员们一致认为这完全是平均留粮造成的。就拿去年说吧，全队十几个小孩多、劳力弱的户，今春都有点吃余的粮食。还有四户把自己吃不完的粮食送给了亲戚朋友，有五户出卖红薯；但是大人多劳力强的十几户，今春都缺粮，由国家统销了一千多斤粮食。为了解决粮食不足的困难，出外拾红薯、买红薯干的就有十二个劳动力，他们外出多则半年，少则一月，直接影响了生产，减少了农业社的收入。另外，劳力强的户因为对平均留粮不满意，经常发牢骚，埋怨小孩多的缺粮户；缺粮户因为常听“二话”，也很苦闷，生产情绪消极。如去年秋季分粮食的时候，小孩较多的社员左春德家，一个刚满月的小孩也和劳力强的单身汉陈金友一样分粮食，陈金友气得五天没有参加生产，又和左春德吵了一架。经过反复讨论以后，大家一致认为实行以人定量的粮食分配办法，不仅符合节约用粮精神，对于发展生产、加强社员之间的团结，也是有利无害的。
    究竟以社为单位还是以队或组为单位互相调剂呢？若以队为单位，各队小孩和大人的比例一般悬殊不大，如以组为单位悬殊就大了。他们给第二、第三生产组算了一笔账。二组小孩多，每个劳动力能平均分粮五百二十斤，第三组小孩少，每个劳力只能平均分粮四百一十三斤。如以组为单位调剂，就不能充分发挥以人定量的作用，仍然解决不了社员之间吃粮多少的矛盾，所以决定以队为单位，以人定量，调剂分配。
    怎样定量？这是社员最关心而又非常复杂的问题。根据社员的要求，他们首先召开了一个扩大队委会，吸收不同类型户的社员代表参加，又聘请了几个对管理家务、支配用粮有经验的壮年妇女作顾问。首先根据年龄大小、劳力强弱的实际情况，本着吃多多分、吃少少分的原则，将不同人的实际用粮数量进行了分析研究，划等分级，提出了每级的一般用粮标准，提交社员大会讨论。具体办法是这样的：
    关于等级的确定：根据社员人口年龄大小和实际用粮情况，共划了六个等级，一岁不吃粮或吃粮很少的小孩为第一级；二至五岁的小孩，他们不参加劳动，一般是两个小孩的吃粮和一个强劳力的吃粮量相等，划为第二级；六至十岁的小孩，除学生外，少数也参加体力劳动，他们的吃粮数量，约占一个强劳力用粮量的70％，划为第三级；十一至十五岁的小孩，大部参加体力劳动，他们的用粮数量只稍低于大人，划为第四级；有些不能参加体力劳动的老年人，他们的用粮数量和十五岁的小孩不相上下，也划为第四级；参加劳动的男女青、壮年划为第五级。鉴于体力强弱对用粮多少影响很大，经社员讨论，决定把劳力分成强、弱两等，分别给予不同补助。对于单身汉，因独立生活，费粮较多，予以特别照顾，不再另划一级。根据以上原则，全队人口按照年龄大小逐户逐人进行了登记。
    每级一般用粮标准的确定：这当中争执较大的是：（1）小孩与劳力的留粮差别问题。因为劳力的补助粮都是从小孩的留量上扣下来的，所以小孩多的户说“劳力能多分增产粮”，主张在国家规定的三定留量内少扣点就行了；而劳力强大人多的户说“增产粮没把握”，主张用多少就留多少。最后讨论决定既要照顾小孩，又要照顾劳力，既要照顾老年，又要照顾壮年，既要看到增产，也要看到减产，总之，以满足社员的实际用粮为原则，小孩可按实际需要留足留够。具体规定第一级每人的一般用粮标准为一百斤，第二级二百五十斤，第三级三百二十斤，第四级三百八十斤，单身汉每人另外补助三十斤。（2）岁数差别问题：级与级之间，特别是上一级的最低岁数和下一级的最高岁数之间，有很多实际年龄只相差几个月，而留粮标准却相差百余斤。要解决这个问题，必须扩大每级的留粮幅度。具体规定在不超过三定留量的原则下，一个等级留量除一般标准外，还有最高标准和最低标准。如第二级一般留量标准为二百五十斤，最低标准为二百斤，最高二百八十斤；（3）参加劳动与不参加劳动的分别问题：有些妇女按年龄应以劳力对待，但他们家务不忙，又长年不参加体力劳动（包括家务劳动）或因病不能参加劳动，大家意见只能按三定留量如数发给，不能按劳力享受补助。十六至十八岁的男女青年，主要按其体力强弱、用粮多少，逐个评议。对于那些体力较弱实际用粮不多、又不参加劳动的，也可按每人三百八十斤留粮。（4）劳力强弱的分别问题：情况非常复杂，很难机械规定标准。如社员权兆峰，虽系壮年，但体力很弱，只能做些轻活，大家评议划为弱劳力。又如社员卢同福，虽已六十九岁，但体力很强，用粮较多，所以划成强劳力。
    划等分级的草案经过列榜公布，社员讨论确定以后，即根据大家自报的实用数量，算了一笔全队的用粮总账。全队共有二百一十人，按三定政策，每人全年留粮标准为三百八十斤，共留粮七万九千八百斤。按以人定量办法，一至四级各级共一百二十一人，根据各级一般用粮标准，总计需粮四万零二百八十斤。全队强劳力四十八个，每人全年一般需粮标准为四百六十斤，共需粮二万二千零八十斤，弱劳力四十一个，每人一般需粮标准为四百二十二斤，共需粮一万七千三百零二斤，四个单身汉每人补助三十斤，共一百二十斤，以上共需粮三万九千五百零二斤。全队以人定量结果，共需粮七万九千七百八十二斤，较三定留粮总数少十八斤。分配办法确定以后，又按三分之一的比例确定了夏季每户的留粮数。
    由于本着实事求是的精神进行了民主评议，这个队的以人定量工作只用四天时间便全部结束了，达到了户户满意。
