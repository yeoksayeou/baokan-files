　　Sun Clock
    The American General Time Corporation has recently invented a new type of "sun clock" that runs on light. This is a 100% automatic clock. It does not need a spring or a battery. It only needs to be placed in sunlight or illuminated with white-hot light for a certain amount of time, and it can run continuously all day and keep accurate time.
