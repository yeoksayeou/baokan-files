Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reported: Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda stated in Parliament on the 7th that the government's most important task at present is to quickly restore the integrity of the national power apparatus and resolve local issues, in order to restore economic integrity.

Juanda said that restoring economic integrity is the most important condition for Indonesia's continued survival.

Juanda made these remarks today during the second rebuttal of the government report, refuting attacks by Harahap and other Masyumi Party members on President Sukarno's emergency measures.

Juanda said that the nationwide martial law declared by the President, the former Prime Minister, and the acting Minister of Defense in mid-March was legal, and the current cabinet supports it and intends to continue its implementation. If the situation returns to normal, the government intends to revoke the martial law or gradually abolish it.

The Indonesian Parliament adjourned after only two minutes of meeting on the evening of June 7. The meeting agreed to give the Juanda cabinet an opportunity to work in a "tacit" manner. No one raised any objections to the government's platform after the government's second response. The executive chairman of the meeting, Deputy Speaker Arudji Kartawinata, announced the adjournment, and future parliamentary sessions will discuss other issues.

Today, the "Social Messenger," a newspaper affiliated with the Islamic Teachers Association, published an editorial hoping that the government would strive to implement its platform after it is approved by the parliament, so that it can achieve results in the short term.

Many newspapers also supported Prime Minister Juanda's second response report in Parliament. These newspapers believe that the government's attitude in dealing with problems is more clear than before.

The Masyumi Party parliamentary group published a statement on its attitude towards the current cabinet in the "Eternal Daily" on the 8th, still believing that the organizational procedures of the current cabinet and the declaration of martial law are illegal.

According to an Antara News Agency report from Makassar, Sumual, who has been relieved of his position as Commander of the Seventh Military District, and Sudirman, who has been relieved of his position as Commander of the South and Southeast Sulawesi Pacification, handed over their military powers to Army Chief of Staff Nasution on June 8. At the same time, Nasution announced that he would entrust the local public security responsibility to Andi, the commander of the South and Southeast Sulawesi Defense Region.

The order to relieve Sumual and Sudirman of their duties was officially announced by Indonesian Army spokesman Piengadi on May 27.

    印度尼西亚国会同意现政府政纲
    朱安达宣布当前要务在恢复政权完整
    陆军参谋长已经接管第七军区的兵权
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚总理朱安达7日在国会中说，政府目前最重要的任务是迅速恢复国家权力工具的完整和解决地方问题，以便恢复经济上的完整。
    朱安达说，恢复经济上的完整是印度尼西亚继续生存的一个最重要的条件。
    朱安达今天在就政府报告第二次答辩的时候，反驳了哈拉哈普和其他马斯友美党议员对苏加诺总统采取紧急措施所作的攻击。
    朱安达说，总统、前任总理兼代国防部长在3月中颁布的全国范围的军事戒严令是合法的，现内阁对此表示赞成，并且要继续执行。如果情况恢复正常，政府就打算撤销军事戒严令，或者逐步地加以撤销。
    印度尼西亚国会6月7日晚上只开了两分钟的会就宣告结束。会议以“默认”的方式同意给朱安达内阁以工作机会。会上没有任何人在政府的第二次答辩以后再对政府的政纲提出不同意见。会议执行主席、副议长阿鲁季·卡塔威纳塔就宣布闭会，以后的国会会议将讨论其他问题。
    今天伊斯兰教师联合会的“社会使者报”发表社论，希望政府在它的政纲得到国会的同意以后努力去加以执行，以便能够在短期内作出成绩。
    许多报纸也都支持朱安达总理在国会上所作的第二次答辩报告。这些报纸认为政府处理问题的态度比以前更加明确了。
    马斯友美党国会议员团在8日的“永恒日报”上发表对现内阁态度的声明，仍然认为现内阁的组织程序和军事戒令的宣布是不合法的。
    据安塔拉通讯社望加锡消息说，已经被解除第七军区司令职务的苏穆阿尔以及被解除南和东南苏拉威西绥靖司令职务的苏狄曼，6月8日把他们的兵权移交给陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安。同时，纳苏蒂安宣布将当地的治安责任托付给南和东南苏拉威西防区司令安迪。
    解除苏穆阿尔和苏狄曼的职务的命令是由印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪在5月27日正式宣布的。
