Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, June 22nd: The newly built Ping'an Shaft of Fuxin Coal Mine has been put into production after five years of construction. This morning, the signing ceremony for the handover and acceptance of the Ping'an Shaft was held. Prior to the signing, the State Acceptance Committee, after careful discussion, assessed the construction quality of this large-scale and technically complex shaft as excellent.

	In the afternoon, a celebration ceremony for the handover to production was held. Shortly after the ribbon-cutting, a train parked under the coal storage bin was filled with newly mined coal and slowly departed the mine.

	This mine, designed with an annual output of 1.5 million tons, will produce hundreds of thousands of tons of coal this year to supply industrial production and the people's livelihood.

	Engineers from the Ministry of Coal Industry and staff from the Fuxin Mining Bureau all praised the Ping'an Shaft, saying: This is a modern shaft with high output and a long lifespan, even more advanced than the shafts already put into production in Liaoyuan, Hegang, and Benxi. According to the design, the Ping'an Shaft's annual production of 1.5 million tons of coal will last not just for a few years, but for decades. The entire mine's service life will reach one hundred years.

	The Ping'an Shaft is located more than ten miles outside the urban area of Fuxin. The ground square of the shaft is built neatly, centrally, and grandly. Passing through the mine's administrative welfare building is the auxiliary shaft comprehensive yard, which is used for transporting materials and personnel. The auxiliary shaft headframe, machine repair shop, winch room, and air heating and ventilation equipment are all located in this yard. Behind this yard is the main shaft comprehensive yard, including the screening plant and boiler room. Behind the main shaft comprehensive yard, there are two elevated corridors for transporting coal, leading to the coal storage bin. Coal that has been screened and sorted is loaded onto trains under this coal storage bin. There is also a corridor for transporting gangue, extending from the main shaft comprehensive yard to a building equipped with a crusher. The rocks excavated from the underground development roadways and the gangue picked from the coal are crushed here and then sent back underground as filling material. Kovrov, the chief engineer of the Leningrad Design Institute in the Soviet Union, which designed this mine, once said that in the construction of this shaft, integrating major facilities such as the winch room, machine repair shop, and substation not only facilitates management and reduces investment in pipelines, cables, and building construction, but more importantly, greatly reduces the occupied area on the ground. Reducing the occupied area reduces the coal pillars retained to prevent ground subsidence from affecting building construction, thus allowing more underground coal to be mined.

	The underground transportation roadways, 400 meters below the surface, are brightly lit, like streets on a summer night. There are perfect safety facilities here, eliminating worries about roof collapses, fires, gas explosions, coal dust explosions, and other dangers. The degree of mechanization in this mine reaches over 90%. Drilling and blasting have been reduced to auxiliary coal mining methods in this mine, and coal cutting machines have also lost their advanced status. Instead, combined coal mining machines are mainly and extensively used. Here, machinery is used for coal mining, machinery is used for transportation, machinery is used for hoisting, machinery is used for screening, and machinery is also used for loading coal into trains.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, June 22nd: China's first hydraulic coal mining zone was born in the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan.

	The hydraulic coal mining zone is located in the 7282 working face of the Linxi Mine. This area has a hard, medium-thick coal seam. The working face has no pillars or coal mining machinery. Only a cannon-like water gun is seen, powerfully aimed at the coal face. When the water gun operator opens the water valve, a strong column of water, white and translucent, shoots out of the nozzle towards the coal face. Instantly, the hard coal seam collapses and softens. The coal that has been hydraulically impacted flows into a dewatering screen through a long iron chute. Here, water and coal are naturally separated, and the water flows into a settling pond. The clean water is then pumped out again as a coal mining water source. In this way, the underground water, which has always endangered the lives of miners, has been transformed into coal mining power.

	This advanced coal mining technology in the world was learned by engineering and technical personnel from the Tangshan Coal Research Institute and Kailuan Coal Mine during their visits to the Soviet Union and Poland last year. After returning to China, the Tangshan Coal Research Institute began the complex technical design of hydraulic coal mining machinery and working faces in August last year. After more than half a year of machinery manufacturing and installation work, industrial hydraulic coal mining experiments were officially conducted on June 15th this year. Experiments have proven that the advantages of hydraulic coal mining are low cost, fast coal output, high efficiency, and miner safety.

    为祖国每年贡献煤炭百五十万吨
    平安竖井投入生产
    第一个水力采煤区在开滦林西矿诞生
    据新华社阜新22日电　新建阜新煤矿平安竖井经过五年的建设，投入生产了。今日上午举行了平安竖井移交接收签字仪式。在签字以前，国家验收委员经过仔细讨论以后，评定这座工程浩大、技术复杂的竖井施工质量为优等。
    下午，举行了移交生产庆祝典礼，在剪彩以后不久，停留在储煤仓下的一列火车装满了新开采出来的煤炭，徐徐开出矿去。
    这座设计年产量达一百五十万吨的矿井，今年将生产几十万吨煤供应工业生产和人民生活需要。
    煤炭部工程师、阜新矿务局工作人员都夸耀平安竖井说：这是一座近代化、产量高、寿命长的竖井，它比已经投入生产的辽源、鹤岗、本溪的竖井还要先进。按照设计，平安竖井年产一百五十万吨煤的年限，不是几年，而是几十年。整个矿井服务年限将达到一百年。
    平安竖井位于阜新市区外十多里的地方。竖井的地面广场建筑得整齐、集中和雄伟。穿过矿的行政福利大楼，就是运送材料、上下人员的副井综合场房。副井井棚、机修厂、绞车房、空气加热通风设备都设在这个场房里。在这个场房背后，就是主井综合场房，包括筛选厂、锅炉房。在主井综合场房后面，有两个输送煤的高空走廊，通到储煤仓。经过筛选、分类了的煤，就在这个储煤仓下装到火车里。另外还有一条输送矸石的走廊，从主井综合场房伸向装有破碎机的房子，从井下开拓巷道掘出的岩石和从煤中拣出的矸石，经过这里破碎，再送到井下作为充填材料。设计这座矿井的苏联列宁格勒设计院总工程师考然洛夫曾经说，在这个井的建设中，像这样把绞车房、机修厂、变电所等主要设施综合建筑在一起，不仅便于管理，减少管路、电缆、房屋建筑投资，更主要的是大大缩小了地面建筑占用面积。占用面积缩小，就使得为防止地面下沉影响房屋建筑而保留的煤柱减少，这样就使得地下煤能够更多地被开采出来。
    深处四百公尺地下的井下运输巷道，灯光通明，有如夏夜街头。这里有着完美的安全设施，不必担心有冒顶、发火、瓦斯爆炸、煤尘爆炸等种种危险。这个矿机械化程度达到90％以上。打眼、放炮，在这个矿已经降为辅助的采煤方式，截煤机也失去了先进的地位，而主要的、大量采用的是联合采煤机。这里，采煤用机械，运输用机械，提升用机械，筛选用机械，往火车里装煤也是用机械。
    新华社唐山22日电　我国第一个水力采煤区，在唐山开滦煤矿林西矿诞生。
    水力采煤区设在林西矿的七二八二掌子。这里属于硬质中厚煤层，工作面没有支柱，也没有采煤机械，只见一个大炮似的水枪，威武地朝向煤壁。水枪手把水门一开，一股白中透亮的强大水柱，从水枪口中，急剧地射向煤壁，刹时，坚硬的煤层，就瘫痪、酥软下来。经过水力冲击下来的煤，顺着漫长的铁溜槽流入脱水筛机。在这里，水、煤自然分开，水又流入沉淀池，清水再由水泵打出，作为采煤水源。就这样，把历来危害矿工生命安全的井下水，变成了采煤动力。
    这种世界上先进的采煤技术，是唐山煤炭科学研究院和开滦煤矿的工程技术人员，去年到苏联、波兰参观学习来的。回国以后，唐山煤炭科学研究院，从去年8月就开始了水力采煤机械和工作面的复杂技术设计，历经半年多的机械制造和安装工作，终于在今年6月15日正式进行工业性的水力采煤试验。试验证明，水力采煤的优点是成本低、出煤快、效率高、矿工安全。
