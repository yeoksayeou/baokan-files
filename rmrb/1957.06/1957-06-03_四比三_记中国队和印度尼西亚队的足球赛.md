Four to three. This was the result of yesterday afternoon's match at the Xianongtan Stadium in the capital between the Chinese football team and the Indonesian team. This victory gives the Chinese team the right to play a third preliminary match with the Indonesian team.

The Indonesian team, famous for its defense, still adopted the formation used in Jakarta yesterday – a defensive formation of 1-4-1-4-1. However, in attack, they also showed an unstoppable momentum, causing the Chinese team's penalty area to be constantly subjected to powerful impacts. The Chinese team also changed its past shortcomings of only short passes and no long passes, and instead cleverly used a combination of long and short passes to score four goals.

An hour before the game, the stands, which could accommodate 16,000 spectators, were already packed.

Zhang Honggen's Cold Shot Opens the Scoring

The game began, and after the Chinese team kicked off, they immediately organized an attack. The defenders and midfielders all pressed past the center line. In just one minute, Zhang Honggen dribbled the ball quickly towards the opponent's penalty area and suddenly unleashed a surprising powerful shot. Saillan failed to save, and the ball went into the net from the upper right corner. More than 10,000 spectators cheered for the Chinese team's beautiful shot.

Although the away team launched a counterattack, the team's soul, Ramang, was closely marked by Chinese defender Gao Junshi. Widarsah, another fast and powerful right winger, was also tightly entangled by Jiang Jixiang. As a result, the ball was almost entirely controlled by the Chinese team. In the twelfth minute, after Chinese team's right winger Ha Zengguang forced a corner kick, he kicked the ball into the front of the goal. Saillan jumped up to catch the ball, but failed to hold it firmly. Zhang Honggen jumped up and headed the ball, which bounced off the crossbar. Just as the Indonesian defender was about to kick the ball out, Nian Weisi cleverly used his body to knock the ball into the net.

Pan Shanlong Scores into an Empty Net

After losing two goals, the away team launched a fierce counterattack. The defenders actively intercepted the opponent's ball, and after intercepting the ball, they quickly made a long pass to center forward Ramang or right winger Widarsah, organizing the attack from the right. During this period, center forward Ramang and right forward Pan Shanlong both shot at the goal, but they were all saved by Huang Zhaowen. As the two sides stalemated until the thirty-fifth minute, Indonesian team's left midfielder Zhang Xinzhong lobbed a high ball into the center. Ramang and Widarsah both sprinted towards the penalty area. Huang Zhaowen rushed out to catch the ball, but was intercepted by defender Jiang Jixiang, who headed it out first. The ball landed twenty yards away, and was quickly caught up by the opponent's right forward Pan Shanlong, who shot into an empty net. At this time, the Chinese team's physical strength was not as good as at the beginning, but the away team's several attacks were blocked by the Chinese team's defenders, ending the first half with a score of two to one.

At the beginning of the second half, the Chinese team scored another goal in one and a half minutes in one go. This goal was scored when midfielder Wang Xiwenthe intercepted the opponent's ball and quickly dribbled it towards the right. Ha Zengguang, Zhang Honggen, and Nian Weisi all feinted to press towards the right side of the penalty area, luring all the opponent's defenders to the right. At this time, Wang Xiwenthe suddenly passed the ball far to left winger Wang Lu on the left. After Wang Lu received the ball, he immediately passed it to Sun Fucheng, who shot powerfully at the goal, and the ball went into the net.

Three to Three, the Two Sides Draw

After losing the goal, the away team still played very calmly and bravely, actively counterattacking. The competition between the two sides was very fierce. In the tenth minute, the away team made a powerful shot in the chaos, and the ball was saved by Huang Zhaowen. Ramang caught up and made a bicycle kick, which was again tipped out by Huang Zhaowen, resulting in a corner kick. Left winger Sjaari kicked the ball out, and the Chinese team's defenders failed to closely mark Ramang. After Ramang received the ball, he turned around and kicked the ball into the net. At this time, the Indonesian team became more active. In less than fifteen minutes, right winger Widarsah dribbled past Jiang Jixiang, who was closely marking him, and chipped the ball into the net from a dead angle. Huang Zhaowen was not prepared, and watched as the ball went into the net from the right corner.

Dense Defense Fails to Achieve Results

After tying the score at three to three, the Indonesian team adopted a tactic of dense defense. In addition to setting up two forwards in the center line, the forwards and defenders all retreated to defend the penalty area, forming a "meat shield" in the penalty area. However, the Chinese team finally scored the crucial goal. This goal was scored fifteen minutes before the end of the game. The Chinese team's forwards used a high ball to lob it into the penalty area. Sun Fucheng took the lead to jump up and head the ball to Wang Lu behind him. Wang Lu raised his left foot and shot fiercely, and the ball rolled into the net from under Saillan's body. After that, although the away team tried hard to counterattack, they failed to break through the opponent's defense under the Chinese team's strict defense. The exciting game ended with a score of four to three.

    四比三
    ——记中国队和印度尼西亚队的足球赛
    国安
    四比三，这是中国足球队和印度尼西亚队昨日下午在首都先农坛体育场比赛的结果。这场比赛的胜利，使中国队取得了同印度尼西亚队再进行第三场预选赛的权利。
    以防守著名的印度尼西亚队，昨天虽然还采用了在雅加达时的阵势——一、四、一、四、一的防守阵势，但在进攻时，也表现了锐不可挡之势，使中国队的禁区内不断遭到有力的冲击。中国队也一改过去只有短传、没有长传的缺点，而是巧妙地利用了长短传相结合的方法，射进了四个球。
    离比赛前还有一个小时，能容纳一万六千名观众的看台上便挤得水泄不通。
  张宏根冷箭首开记录
    比赛开始，中国队发球后，立即组织了进攻。后卫、前卫一齐压过中线，仅一分钟，张宏根带球飞快地向对方禁区挺进，突然出其不意地一记劲射，萨益兰扑救不及，球从右上角进网，一万多名观众齐为中国队这一漂亮的射门欢呼。
    客队虽然发动了反攻，但是客队的灵魂拉曼被中国队后卫高筠时死盯住，另一速度快、射门有力的右翼威达沙又被姜杰祥紧紧缠住，因此全场的球几乎都被中国队控制。到十二分钟时，中国队右翼哈增光在逼成角球后，一脚踢出，球正落在门前，萨益兰跃起接球，未接牢，张宏根跃起一顶，球中横木弹出，印度尼西亚队后卫正想将球踢出，这时年维泗机警地用身体将球撞入网内。
    潘善龙射进空门
    客队在输了两个球后，发动了猛烈的反攻。守卫积极抢截对方的球，在截到球后飞快地一脚长传给中锋拉曼或右翼威达沙，从右面组织进攻，其间中锋拉曼、右锋潘善龙都曾射门，但都被黄肇文一一接住。双方相持至三十五分钟时，印度尼西亚队左前卫张鑫昌一脚高球吊中，拉曼、威达沙齐向禁区冲刺，黄肇文急忙冲出接球，但却被后卫姜杰祥抢先顶出，球落在二十码处，被对方右锋潘善龙迅速赶上，一脚射入空门。这时中国队体力已不如刚开始时充沛，但客队的几次进攻，都被中国队后卫挡住，以二比一结束了上半时比赛。
    下半时开始时，中国队一鼓作气在一分半钟内又射进了一球。这个球是由前卫王锡文在截得对方的球后，将球迅速带向右边挺进，哈增光、张宏根、年维泗都佯向禁区右面紧压，将对方的守卫全部诱往右方，这时王锡文突然将球远传给左边的左翼王陆，王陆接球后立刻拨给孙福成，孙福成在门口一脚劲射，球应声入网。
  三比三双方打成平局
    客队在输球后踢得仍极沉着、勇猛，积极反攻，双方争夺十分激烈，至十分钟时，客队在乱军中一记劲射，球被黄肇文扑出，拉曼赶上一记倒钩射门，又被黄肇文跃起托出，造成角球。左翼沙亚利一脚踢出，中国队后卫未紧紧盯住拉曼，拉曼接球后，转身将球踢入网内。这时印度尼西亚队更为活跃，不到十五分钟，右翼威达沙盘过死盯住他的姜杰祥，在死角内将球削进网内，黄肇文未及准备，眼看球从右角入网。
    密集防守未收效
    打成三比三后，印度尼西亚队采取了密集防守的战术，除在中线设了两名前锋外，锋、卫一齐退守禁区，在禁区内组成了一道“肉屏风”。但中国队终于射进了关键性的一球。这一球是在终场前十五分钟射进的。中国队前锋利用一记高球吊向禁区，孙福成抢先一步跃起将球顶给后面的王陆，王陆举左脚猛射，球从萨益兰身下滚进网内。此后，客队虽然努力反攻，但在中国队的严密防守下，未能突破对方的防线。四比三结束这场扣人心弦的比赛。
