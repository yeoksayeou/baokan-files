Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Central Standing Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association continued to hold a joint meeting today to criticize Zhang Naiqi's erroneous remarks.

Twelve people spoke at today's meeting: Huang Changshui, Wang Guangying, Bi Mingqi, Gong Tianmin, Wu Yunshan, Miao Hainan, Xiang De, Liu Yongye, Lu Yannan, Tang Diyin, Hu Ziying, and Wu Juenong. Zhang Naiqi attended the meeting this afternoon, but he still insisted on his own opinions and did not engage in any self-criticism.

Bi Mingqi, starting from his own ideological examination, discussed his understanding of Zhang Naiqi's erroneous remarks. He said: In my four speeches at the forum for industrialists and businessmen convened by the United Front Work Department, there were several errors, such as overestimating the progressive aspect of the national bourgeoisie and underestimating the negative aspect in a way that was divorced from reality. This was because I believed that handing over the means of production was the primary thing and ideological transformation was secondary, which was tantamount to telling industrialists and businessmen to relax their ideological transformation. Furthermore, in my speech, I said, "The vast majority of national capitalists have finally embarked on today's new historical stage, transforming private enterprises into socialist enterprises. In this socialist transformation history, China's national bourgeoisie is great." Although these words were different from Zhang Naiqi's "Red Bourgeoisie" tune, the melody was the same, which was tantamount to saying that the national bourgeoisie could spontaneously move towards socialism. Bi Mingqi said that my statement "Both are masters, there are no guests, all are in the socialist realm" was like wanting to stand as equals with the working class.

After analyzing and examining the ideological roots of the above points, Bi Mingqi went on to talk about his understanding of Zhang Naiqi's erroneous remarks. He said: The essence of Zhang Naiqi's thoughts and remarks is to negate the leadership of the working class and the superiority of socialism. He said: In the article "Several Issues Concerning the Guidance Work of Industrial and Commercial Transformation," Zhang Naiqi talked about how to give play to the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen. Although he repeatedly said that the socialist system is superior, he said that due to the existence of the "three evils," socialist enterprises would not have higher work efficiency than modernized capitalist enterprises. According to Zhang Naiqi, socialism has no superiority, and capitalism has superiority instead. This is closing your eyes to the facts and distorting reality.

Bi Mingqi said that Zhang Naiqi attempted to incite and sow discord between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in several arguments, and used the wavering nature of the industrial and commercial circles to prevent them from steadily and wholeheartedly following the Communist Party on the socialist road. This is extremely vicious.

The speeches of Miao Hainan, Xiang De, Liu Yongye, Wu Juenong, Tang Diyin and others refuted Zhang Naiqi's speech at the meeting on the 15th.

Miao Hainan said that Zhang Naiqi said in his speech that the current confusion in the industrial and commercial circles was caused by the Party's rectification movement. This was Zhang Naiqi's malicious attack on the Party. Zhang Naiqi has been making slanderous remarks about the Party since the Second Plenary Session of the China National Democratic Construction Association last year. For example, in the past, he emphasized that the negative aspects of industrialists and businessmen were a side effect of the "Five-Anti" movement, and this time he attributed the ideological confusion in the industrial and commercial circles caused by his fallacies to the Party's rectification movement. This is extremely hateful.

Miao Hainan said that Zhang Naiqi believes that the current stage is from coercion to persuasion, which means that in the past, the Communist Party coerced the industrial and commercial circles. Then, was the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the industrial and commercial circles, and the industrial and commercial circles welcoming the high tide of joint ventures with gongs and drums, a form of coercion?

Xiang De criticized Zhang Naiqi's remarks that leadership and being led are only the difference between advanced and backward, and that there are differences between the class essence and the class characteristics of people.

Xiang De said that in the process of development, some aging things are transformed into new ones, and some are rejected or eliminated to the point of death and annihilation. The leadership of the working class over the bourgeoisie is to make capitalism die and socialism grow, so transformation is about breaking capitalism and establishing socialism. This is a qualitative change, not just a quantitative comparison in progress, as Zhang Naiqi said. Therefore, the bourgeoisie must undergo a complete transformation when accepting transformation, rather than just wiping off the brand on the surface.

Xiang De said that Zhang Naiqi believes that the class essence and the class characteristics of people are different. Scattered capitalists do not exploit, but after forming a bourgeois collective, they possess the essence of exploitation. Scattered capitalists have undergone a qualitative change in the process of forming a collective. I believe that it is precisely because each capitalist has exploitative behavior that the exploitative essence of the bourgeoisie is formed. The exploitative ability of scattered capitalists is not so great. When capitalists form their own organizations, and further form a political power and international organizations, their exploitative ability expands step by step. This is a quantitative expansion and does not involve a qualitative change.

Xiang De also criticized Zhang Naiqi's statement that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." He said, what is Zhang Naiqi's intention in forcibly comparing the shortcomings in work—bureaucracy—with the social system—the capitalist exploitation system? In fact, it is to seize on this point to deny the superiority of socialism.

Xiang De finally said that Zhang Naiqi's thousands of words aim to seize on the negative aspects of the industrial and commercial circles and call on industrialists and businessmen to accept his erroneous theories.

Lu Yannan said that Zhang Naiqi's argument of from coercion to persuasion portrays the past policies and work of the Party and government as coercion, and portrays the acceptance of transformation by the bourgeoisie as coming from coercion. This negates the peaceful transformation, negates the progressive aspects of the industrial and commercial circles, and negates the work achievements of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Lu Yannan asked Zhang Naiqi to clearly explain which aspects of Li Weihan's speech at the forum for industrialists and businessmen he disagreed with.

Wu Juenong raised seven questions about Zhang Naiqi's speech on the 15th. When talking about Zhang Naiqi's belief that the excessive actions of "dogmatic bureaucrats" have caused the industrialists and businessmen to feel inferior and timid, he asked: Should all the negative actions of the industrialists and businessmen be borne by the so-called "dogmatic bureaucrats"? And who are the so-called bureaucrats? Besides the public representatives and Communist Party members, who else are you referring to? Isn't this sowing discord?

Tang Diyin refuted ten points from Zhang Naiqi's speech last Saturday.

Tang Diyin also asked Zhang Naiqi why he supported and encouraged the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping when he represented the China National Democratic Construction Association at the board of directors of the Guangming Daily?

Hu Ziying said that Zhang Naiqi's mistake was to use some vaguely present dissatisfaction among bourgeois elements to stir up trouble, attempting to have the vast number of industrialists and businessmen follow him under his call, to open a gap in the unity of the people, and to oppose socialist transformation. She said that according to Zhang Naiqi's recent erroneous arguments, it is sufficient to show that this is a struggle between two lines. She believes that we should not think that socialist transformation has basically won, and that there is no struggle in the ideological field and politics. She suggested that the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should express their position and clarify their attitude to the Chinese people, and lead the national industrial and commercial circles to fight against the rightists.

Zhang Naiqi Continues to Refuse Criticism, and Slanders that the Criticisms of Him by Industrial and Commercial Circles in Various Places are the Result of Coercion

Zhang Naiqi's speech today not only lacked self-criticism, but instead questioned whether this joint meeting conformed to the spirit of the Party's rectification movement. He quoted the third paragraph of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on the rectification movement to criticize this meeting for not implementing the spirit of gentle breeze and fine rain, and for violating the Party's instructions on the rectification movement. He said that he also doubted whether the meetings currently being held in various places by industrial and commercial circles to criticize Zhang Naiqi were the result of coercion or persuasion.

Regarding the issue of fixed interest not being exploitation, he explained his statement again today. He said that fixed interest is unearned income for private individuals, but it is the remnants of exploitation for the bourgeoisie. After listing the reasons to explain this view, he defended his views on the relationship between the bourgeoisie and class elements, and their two-sidedness. He does not admit that his remarks are anti-socialist, nor does he admit that this is a struggle between two lines. He said that only those who want capitalist restoration can be said to be reactionary. He said that he is "relaxed and happy, and at peace with himself;" while others' criticisms of him are "wishful thinking." His remarks caused extreme dissatisfaction among those present.

The meeting continuously received telegrams or letters from the Standing Committees of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in Lanzhou, Tianjin, and Beijing, requesting a profound criticism of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks. If he persists in his errors and refuses to correct them, they request the two organizations to impose organizational sanctions.

　　工商联和民建会的委员们舌战章乃器
    章乃器为什么给章伯钧储安平撑腰打气？
    据新华社17日讯　全国工商联常务委员会和民主建国会中央常务委员会今天继续举行联席会议，批判章乃器的错误言论。
    今天在会上发言的有黄长水、王光英、毕鸣岐、巩天民、吴韫山、苗海南、向德、刘永业、卢燕南、汤蒂因、胡子婴、吴觉农十二人。章乃器下午出席了会议，但他仍旧坚持自己的意见，丝毫没有进行自我批评。
    毕鸣岐从自己的思想检查谈到他对章乃器错误言论的认识。他说：我在统战部召开的工商界人士座谈会上的四次发言中有几点错误，如把民族资产阶级进步的一面作了过高的估计，而把消极的一面又脱离实际地低估了。这是由于我认为把生产资料交出去是主要的，把思想改造看作是次要的，这等于叫工商界放松思想改造；再如我在发言中说：“绝大多数的民族资本家终于走上了今天这个历史新阶段，把私营企业改造为社会主义企业了，在这一段社会主义改造历史中，中国的民族资产阶级是伟大的”，这些话和章乃器所说的“红色资产阶级”曲子虽然不同，而调子是相同的，这就等于说民族资产阶级可以自发地走向社会主义。毕鸣岐说，我还说“同是主人没有客，同在社会主义领域中”这句话就像要和工人阶级分庭抗礼了。
    毕鸣岐在分析和检查自己上述论点的思想根源后，接着谈到他对章乃器的错误言论的认识，他说：章乃器的思想言论，实质上是否定了工人阶级的领导、否认社会主义的优越性。他说：章乃器在“关于工商改造辅导工作的几个问题”的文章中谈到了如何发挥工商业家的积极性的问题，虽然口口声声说社会主义制度是优越的，但他却说由于“三害”的存在，所以社会主义企业就不如现代化的资本主义企业会有较高的工作效率。照章乃器这样说法社会主义就没有优越性了，反而资本主义倒有优越性。这是闭着眼睛不看事实，也是歪曲了现实。
    毕鸣岐说，章乃器在若干论点中企图煽动和挑拨离间民族资产阶级和工人阶级的关系，利用工商界的动摇性来使工商界不能平平稳稳地一心一意地跟着共产党走社会主义道路，这是非常恶毒的。
    苗海南、向德、刘永业、吴觉农、汤蒂因等人的发言，都对章乃器15日在这个会上的讲话作了驳斥。
    苗海南说，章乃器那天发言中说目前工商界的混乱是由于党的整风运动引起的，这是章乃器对党的恶毒攻击。章乃器远从去年民建二中全会以来就发表一些污蔑党的言论。例如他过去强调工商业者的消极性是“五反”运动的副作用，这次又把由于他的谬论引起工商界思想混乱，说成是党的整风运动引起的，这是十分可恶的。
    苗海南说，章乃器认为现在是从压服到说服的阶段，那就是说过去共产党对工商界都是压服的，那么，党对工商界的和平改造政策、工商界敲锣打鼓迎接合营高潮，是不是压服呢？
    向德批判了章乃器的领导和被领导只是先进和落后的区别，阶级本质和人的阶级特性有所不同的言论。
    向德说，在发展过程中，衰老的东西一部分转化成为新生的，一部分被排斥或淘汰以至死亡消灭。工人阶级对资产阶级的领导，就是要使资本主义死去，使社会主义成长，所以改造就是破资本主义，立社会主义。这是质的变化，不是章乃器所说的先进与落后只是前进中的量的比较。因此资产阶级接受改造就要脱胎换骨，而不是在外表上擦去烙印而已。
    向德说，章乃器认为阶级本质和人的阶级特性不同，零散的资本家是不剥削的，在组成了资产阶级集体后就具备了剥削本质，零散的资本家在组织成集体的过程中起了质的变化。我认为正是由于每个资本家都具有剥削行为，才形成资产阶级的剥削本质。零散的资本家的剥削能力不那么大，到资本家组成自己的团体，再进一步组成政权，组成国际性组织，剥削能力就一步一步扩大了，这是量的扩大，没有起质的变化。
    向德还批判章乃器的“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”的说法。他说，章乃器硬要把工作中的缺点——官僚主义，同社会制度——资本主义剥削制度相提并论，其用意何在呢？实际上就是要抓住这一点否定社会主义的优越性。
    向德最后说，章乃器的千言万语，其目的就是要抓住工商界消极的一面，号召工商业者接受他的错误理论。
    卢燕南说，章乃器的从压服到说服的论点，是把过去党和政府的政策和工作都说成了压服，把资产阶级接受改造说成是压服而来的。这是否定了和平改造，否定了工商界进步的一面，否定了民主建国会和工商联的工作成绩。
    卢燕南要求章乃器清楚地说明他不同意李维汉在工商界座谈会上发言中的那些地方。
    吴觉农就章乃器15日的发言提出了七点疑问。他在谈到章乃器认为“教条主义的官僚们”的过分行动造成了工商业者的自卑和畏缩情绪时，问道：工商业者的一切消极行动，都应该由所谓“教条主义的官僚们来承担这一责任吗？而所谓官僚们又是谁呢？除了公方代表和共产党员难道指的是别人吗？这不是挑拨离间是什么呢？
    汤蒂因从章乃器上星期六的讲话中，提出了十条加以驳斥。
    汤蒂因还提出问章乃器在代表民主建国会出席光明日报的社务委员会时，为什么为章伯钧、储安平的错误言论撑腰打气？
    胡子婴说，章乃器的错误是利用资产阶级分子一些若隐若现的不服气的情绪，进行挑拨，企图将广大工商界在他的号召下跟着他跑，来打开人民团结的缺口，来反对社会主义改造。她说，根据章乃器最近的错误论点，已足够说明这是两条路线的斗争。她认为不要以为社会主义改造已基本胜利，在思想领域和政治上就没有斗争了。她建议民建会中央和全国工商联要向中国人民表示立场、明确态度，领导全国工商界向右派分子作斗争。
    章乃器继续拒绝批评，并污蔑各地工商界批判他是压服出来的
    章乃器今天的发言，不但没有自我批评，反而责问这个联席会议是不是符合党的整风运动的精神，他引用了中共中央关于整风运动的指示的第三段批评这个会议没有贯彻和风细雨的精神，是违背了党的整风运动的指示。他说，他还怀疑目前各地工商界在开会批判章乃器到底是压服出来的还是说服出来的。
    关于定息不是剥削的问题，他今天又解释了自己的说法，他说定息对私方个人来说，是不劳而获，而对资产阶级来讲是剥削残余。他列举理由说明这个看法后，又在资产阶级和阶级分子的关系、两面性等问题上为自己的论点进行辩护。他不承认他的言论是反社会主义的，他也不承认这是两条路线的斗争。他说只有想要资本主义复辟的人才能说反动。他说，他是“轻松愉快，心安理得”；而别人对他的批判是“想入非非”。他的这些发言，引起到会的人的极端不满。
    会上连续收到兰州、天津、北京三市的民建和工商联常务委员会来电或来信，要求对章乃器的反动言论进行深刻的批判。如果他坚持错误不肯改正，要求两个组织给予组织上的处分。
