Market Watch

    After the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee strengthened the management of market prices, state-owned and joint state-private stores have reduced the prices of over 700 commodities with unreasonably increased prices back to their original levels. Additionally, over 300 commodities have had their prices lowered due to production development, reduced costs, and smaller regional price differences. Simultaneously, instances of short-weighing and selling inferior goods as superior goods in the market have also decreased.
    After more than twenty days of price inspections, state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private commercial sectors have rectified situations where some stores had unilaterally raised prices or where the price increases were excessively large. This includes daily-use goods, stationery, medicines, knitwear, and some non-staple foods like vegetables and aquatic products.
    In the free market, due to strengthened management and the curbing of certain small vendors' arbitrary price gouging for over 40 major non-staple foods like vegetables and aquatic products, coupled with the arrival of the peak season and increased market supply, prices have fallen back.
    However, to date, some stores and small vendors still operate poorly, unilaterally raising prices or shorting weights, and some lower the quality of goods, raising prices in disguised forms. Currently, the price inspection work is still ongoing. The handling of stores and small vendors who operate illegally is being studied.

    天津七百多种商品压回原来牌价
    天津市人民委员会加强对市场物价管理以后，国营和公私合营商店已有七百多种价格上涨不合理的商品压回到原来牌价，另有三百多种商品，由于生产发展，成本降低和地区差价缩小而降低了牌价；同时市场上卖货少秤、以次货顶好货的现象也见减少。
    经过二十多天的物价检查，国营、合作社和公私合营商业方面，对部分商店擅自提高价格，或者提价幅度偏大的情形已予纠正的，有日用百货、文具、医药、针织品和蔬菜、水产等部分副食品。
    在自由市场上，蔬菜、水产等四十多种主要副食品，由于加强管理，制止了某些小商贩随意哄抬价格的行为，加以旺季到来，上市量增多，因而价格回落。
    但是，到目前为止，仍有一些商店和小商贩经营作风不好，擅自提高价格或少给分量，有的降低货品质量，变相涨价。目前检查物价工作仍在继续进行。对不守法经营的商店、小商贩，正在研究处理。
