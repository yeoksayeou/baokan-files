　　Fengfeng Coal Mine Overproduces More Than 70,000 Tons of Coal

　　(Our Newspaper) News: From January to May, the Fengfeng Coal Mine overproduced more than 77,000 tons of coal beyond the plan, completing 106.24% of the plan, an increase of 17.55% compared to the same period last year. The cost was also reduced by more than 24,000 yuan compared to the plan.

　　Recently, the leadership of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, based on the suggestions of engineering and technical personnel, implemented a chief engineer responsibility system in the mining bureau and two qualified mines. This gave engineering and technical personnel authority and responsibility, fully leveraging their enthusiasm. Leading cadres also went deep into the masses, listened to the opinions of workers, and improved some unreasonable systems, which enhanced workers' enthusiasm for production. At the same time, they promoted the advanced experience of regular cycle operations and timber substitutes, ensuring balanced tunneling underground. They implemented cost accounting and a system where leaders go to workshops and shifts, so that every worker can understand the completion of the daily production plan before leaving work, in order to strive for production in a more planned way.
