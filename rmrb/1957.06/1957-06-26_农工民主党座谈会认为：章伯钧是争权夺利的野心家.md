The Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers Symposium Believes:
	Zhang Bojun is an Ambitious Conspirator for Power
	This newspaper reports that at the expanded symposium of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers held last night, some of Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks were further exposed.
	Huang Qixiang spoke first, saying: Zhang Bojun is a vicious and ruthless ambitious person. After Lu Yuwen criticized Zhang Bojun's speech, Zhang Bojun suspected that Lu Yuwen was a Communist Party member, suspecting that the Communist Party wanted to attack him through Lu Yuwen. Someone told him that Lu Yuwen was not a Communist Party member, and he forced a bitter smile, expressing his disagreement. This is his understanding of the Communist Party. Huang Qixiang continued: On the afternoon of June 9th (Sunday), Zhang Bojun invited Li Boqiu, Yang Yitang, and others to my house for a casual chat. As soon as he arrived, he said: "The situation has changed drastically in the past two days, it's time to 'reel it in'"; Pu Xixiu also called to ask if I should notify Wenhui Daily. Zhang also said: "Yesterday (8th), the People's Daily published an editorial, 'Why is this happening?', the Communist Party has lost money. It’s too early to 'reel it in'. I heard that various places are very chaotic. Why should the Communist Party take action to 'reel it in' themselves? It's better for us to clean up the mess. We have a way. Fei Xiaotong and I both think so." Wang Ji said: He once said in a report at a cadre meeting of the Ministry of Communications: "Premier Zhou asked me to be the Minister of Communications. I said that I am engaged in politics, and the Ministry of Communications is just a matter of building bridges, repairing roads, and selling boat tickets. I can't do it." He said that he had position but no power in the Ministry of Communications, but in reality, he often didn't go to work, went to the Xiaoshi market, and bought antiques. Comrades in the ministry couldn't find Minister Zhang. This means that he gave up his powers and didn't take responsibility, not that he had position but no power. He favored upholding the interests of the bourgeoisie in the joint public-private ownership, and believed that the joint venture of Minsheng Company was his power, not the party's power.
	Wang Yifan said: Zhang Bojun wanted to recruit all representative figures in the country into the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers, and even wanted to bring in Huang Yifeng, who had been expelled from the Communist Party. (At this time, Li Boqiu interjected: Zhang Bojun once said not to allow Zhong Huilan to join the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers, saying that Zhong was close to the Communist Party. It can be seen that the "representativeness" he wanted was a backward representativeness.) He also wanted to find all the old Third Party members who are now frustrated, made mistakes, and have difficulties, and make them the backbone of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers.
	In 1949, the whole country was liberated, and everyone was very happy, but Zhang Bojun said to me: "The revolution has succeeded, but our organization has failed." His words showed a disinclined mood towards the Communist Party. All these show Zhang Bojun's political ambitions.
	Yang Yitang revealed in his speech that Zhang Bojun had told him that his purpose in engaging in party activities was "there is strength only with unity, and power can be obtained only with strength."
	He also said that senior intellectuals should not only be given good food and accommodation, as that would be like putting them in the Western Suburbs Park, not allowing them freedom. Fei Xiaotong is an example of this, and he is still not convinced.
	Also, after the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Bojun compared the relationship between the Communist Party and the national bourgeoisie to that of a cat and a mouse. The implication is that the party's transformation of capitalists is hypocritical.
	Li Shijian attended the meeting despite his illness. He said in his final speech: Li Jiansheng is Zhang Bojun's closest friend and lover, and also a person in charge of the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers. What is her view on Zhang Bojun's problem? We haven't heard a word from her so far. We sincerely advise her to express her attitude and position.
	Wang Shenlin, Li Shihao, and Wang Zhenxin also spoke at this symposium.
	Li Boqiu, Wang Renxuan, and Ji Quan made written statements at this symposium.

### 农工民主党座谈会认为：章伯钧是争权夺利的野心家

　　农工民主党座谈会认为：
　　章伯钧是争权夺利的野心家
    本报讯  昨天晚上举行的中国农工民主党中委扩大座谈会上，继续揭发了章伯钧的一些反动言论。
    黄琪翔首先发言，他说：章伯钧是一个恶毒无情的野心家。卢郁文批评了章伯钧的发言以后，章伯钧怀疑卢郁文是共产党员，怀疑共产党是要通过卢郁文来打击他。有人告诉他卢郁文不是共产党员，他强作苦笑，表示不同意。这就是他对共产党的认识。黄琪翔接着说：6月9日（星期日）下午，章伯钧约李伯球、杨逸棠等到我家里闲谈。他一到就说：“这两天形势大变了，要‘收’了”；浦熙修也打电话问我是不是要通知文汇报。章还说：“昨天（8日）人民日报发的社论‘这是为什么’，共产党算是输了钱。‘收’得太早。听说各地方很乱，共产党何必自己下手‘收’呢？让我们去收场比较好，我们有办法，费孝通和我都是这样看法。”王寄一说：他有一次在交通部干部大会报告中说：“周总理要我当交通部长，我表示我是搞政治的，交通部不过是修桥补路、卖卖船票的事情，我是搞不来的。”他说他在交通部有职无权，实际上是经常不上班、去逛晓市、买古董，部里的同志找章部长找不到，这就是说他自己放弃职权，不负责任，不是有职无权。他对公私合营偏重拥护资产阶级利益，并认为民生公司能够合营是他的力量，不是党的力量。
    王一帆说：章伯钧想把全国有代表性的人物，都收罗到农工民主党里来，甚至还想把开除出共产党的黄逸峰也拉进来。（这时李伯球插了一句话：章伯钧曾表示不要钟惠澜加入农工民主党，说钟是靠近共产党的人，可见他要的“代表性”是落后的代表性。）他还想把所有现在失意的、犯过错误的、有困难的老第三党成员通通都找来，做农工民主党的骨干。
    1949年，全国解放了，大家都很高兴，章伯钧却对我说：“革命成功了，但是我们搞组织是失败了。”言下对共产党有不服气的情绪。这些都说明章伯钧的政治野心。
    杨逸棠在发言中揭露章伯钧对他说过，他从事党派活动的目的是“有团结而后有力量，有力量而后取得权力”。
    他还说，要高级知识分子，不能光给他吃好的住好的，那样好比把他放在西郊公园，不让他自由，是不行的。如对费孝通就是一个例子，他到现在还不心服。
    还有在中共八大以后，章伯钧把共产党和民族资产阶级的关系比作是猫和老鼠的关系。意思就是说党对资本家的改造是假慈悲。
    李世鉴带病出席了会议，他最后发言说：李健生是章伯钧的最亲密朋友和爱人，也是农工民主党的一个负责人，她对章伯钧的问题如何看法？到现在没听到她的一句声音，我们忠诚劝告她表明态度和立场。
    王深林、李士豪、王枕心也在这次座谈会上发了言。
    李伯球、王人旋和嵇铨在这次座谈会上作了书面发言。
