　　Hoping Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji Clarify their Positions
　　Shi Liang's Speech at the China Democratic League Central Group Discussion
    Shortcomings in Judicial Work Cannot Be Ignored
    Knowing the Mistake but Refusing to Admit It
    Neglecting Legal Professionals and Idly Leaving them Unused
    In order to help our leadership party to rectify its work style, I have already made suggestions at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department, and I will say a little more now.
    Regarding judicial work, I think that the achievements in these years are indeed huge, and a lot of things have been done for the people, but the shortcomings and mistakes cannot be ignored. The judicial organs have wrongly judged some cases in the past in the "Three-Anti", "Five-Anti" and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements. However, I often hear some judicial cadres, and even some more responsible party cadres say: "Our wrongly judged cases are only a few percent." This is a very harmful complacent mood. It is true that wrongly judged cases are only a few percent, or even one percent, of the total number of cases, but for the wrongly judged people, they suffer 100 percent of injustice and misfortune. I support Chairman Mao's instruction on "counter-revolutionaries must be eliminated, and mistakes must be corrected." I see that many places have done so. However, I also see that some judicial organs have discounted this principle in its implementation. Some cases were wrongly judged. After the parties concerned applied, and even the relevant parties and the higher judicial organs pointed out the mistakes, the judges knew that they were wrong, but they refused to admit the mistakes and declare an acquittal. They still tried hard to find a small fault with the person and announced "educational release." In fact, it is not the innocent defendants who should be educated, but the subjective judges themselves. What is worse is that they were originally wrong, but they were reluctant to correct it in time, so that the wronged people could not get timely redress. This is intolerable. Secondly, there are also shortcomings in the treatment of our country's original jurists. In the adjustment of departments in colleges and universities, in ideological reform, and in judicial reform, some old professors were treated with great disrespect. Of course, it must be affirmed that all laws serve the class, and all old legal personnel must be reformed. However, all legal scholars who are willing to reform and criticize their old legal views and are willing to serve my country's socialist cause should also be given opportunities to play their role. However, in the adjustment of departments in colleges and universities, many places did not arrange work or organize studies for some professors for a considerable period of time, leaving them idle and ignored, like sitting on the sidelines. Some were even arranged for work, but the arrangements were improper, or they could not exert their potential. I think this is due to the bureaucracy and sectarian emotions of some Communist Party members, so they do not fully understand the painful feelings of the professors who want to contribute to my country's legal science under the leadership of the Communist Party but cannot exert their potential. Therefore, we believe that the enthusiasm and potential of the original professors and jurists who are willing to serve socialist legality should be fairly assessed, and their due role should be further developed.
    Now I would like to make a point about the new situation that has emerged in the current rectification movement and the attitude that our league should adopt.
　　There are such people in the democratic parties:
　　On the one hand, they express their support for socialism
　　On the other hand, they oppose the proletarian dictatorship
    This time the Communist Party's internal rectification is a major event in our country's political life. The purpose of the rectification movement is to rectify the unhealthy trends in the Communist Party, so as to strengthen the Party's core leadership role in state affairs. Strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, so that our country's socialist construction will advance by leaps and bounds. This goal will inevitably be achieved. In addition to this, the rectification movement and the opinions put forward by people outside the Party have so far revealed a new situation, that is, the true face of the rightists who are anti-communist and anti-socialist, thus launching a fierce political and ideological struggle among the people. One aspect of this struggle is to support socialism and support the leadership of the Party, and the other aspect is to oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party, and to revive capitalism and bourgeois "democracy and liberalism."
    Now we have found such people in our democratic parties: on the one hand, they express their support for socialism, on the other hand, they oppose the proletarian dictatorship, and insist that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class is the root of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism; on the one hand, they express their acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, on the other hand, they slander the Communist Party for having the "party's world" and "family's world" mentality; on the one hand, they say they are helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style, on the other hand, they spread rumors that slander the Communist Party and abuse the leaders of the Party, and provoke and incite the people's resentment against the Party and the government. For such remarks and actions, the workers, peasants, students and people from all walks of life have been indignant in the past few days. Members and leaders of our democratic parties have the responsibility to expose and criticize them as much as possible, and fully expose their true colors to the masses, so as to achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong and educating the masses. This is also an important task that we must undertake to help the Party to rectify its work style.
    Comrades! You must all understand who the person I am talking about is? That is Chu Anping, and those who openly and secretly support Chu Anping.
    It is necessary to draw a clear line with Chu Anping
    Those who support him should stand up
    At the last symposium, Comrade Deng Chumin suggested that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League should express its attitude towards Chu Anping's speech. I completely agree. As one of the leaders of the China Democratic League, I want to publicly declare that Chu Anping's entire speech is thoroughly anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist. Our country is led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is guaranteed by the Constitution; our national leaders are elected through democratic procedures by the National People's Congress. Chu Anping is a member of the China Democratic League, the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily, and a representative of the National People's Congress. He once solemnly raised his hand to pass the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and participated in the election of national leaders. He now openly opposes the decision of the National People's Congress in which he participated, and blames Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, who are supported and loved by the people of the whole country, and slanders Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for having the "party's world" mentality. Isn't this provoking and inciting the people of the whole country to resent our leading Party and Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou? Isn't this anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist?
    Some people have already said that it is unimaginable that Chu Anping dared to make such reactionary remarks without strong support behind him. Therefore, I advocate that our China Democratic League Central Committee must clearly express that it draws a clear line with Chu Anping. If any of us support Chu Anping, they should stand up publicly. We allow criticism and counter-criticism, which is the correct way to handle contradictions among the people. To prevent contradictions among the people from turning into antagonistic contradictions, it is only possible through open criticism and counter-criticism. We oppose the insidious practice of doing one thing in front of people and another behind their backs.
    Is Zhang Bojun's understanding vague?
    Or is there another set of things behind his back?
    Here I want to make a point to Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun. In Bojun's speech at the last central group symposium, I think the criticism of Chu Anping was very insufficient, vague and ambiguous. Yesterday, when I saw Bojun's article in the Guangming Daily, the attitude and position of the criticism of Chu Anping were still not clear enough. Although Bojun's article said: "Chu Anping's anti-socialist erroneous remarks cannot represent the Guangming Daily at all. His 'party's world' remarks are completely contrary to the position of the Guangming Daily." But Bojun did not explain what attitude he took towards Chu Anping's speech? He also did not analyze where the errors of Chu Anping's speech were? At most, Bojun only stated that Chu Anping's speech could not represent the Guangming Daily, but did not state that Chu Anping was spreading anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, attempting to "fundamentally shake the people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Party, and undermine the socialist cause." In short, Bojun's criticism of Chu Anping's speech did not touch the essence of the problem. I want to ask Bojun, are you also worried, so you deliberately ambiguous, or do you really not understand the essence of Chu Anping's speech?
    Chu Anping's speech was published in the capacity of the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily. Bojun is the president of the Guangming Daily. The president should be responsible for the political responsibility of the newspaper. Therefore, did Chu Anping consult with Bojun before making this speech, and did Bojun question him after the speech was published? Did you express your agreement or disagreement with his views? I think Bojun has a responsibility to explain these key issues to everyone.
    I remember that on Saturday evening (June 8), Bojun came to me to talk. I asked Bojun. I asked him whether Chu Anping's speech was discussed with you beforehand? He said "No, Luo Longji has seen it." Bojun also said: "Some people told me that Chu Anping's words hit the nail on the head. But I don't think there is any need to write an editorial. And he repeatedly mentioned Lu Yuwen, Lu Yuwen is just a clown. I think Hu Feng and Chu Anping will become historical figures. The so-called historical figures will be judged in a few hundred years." I really didn't understand what Bojun meant when he said this at that time. Now, after reading Bojun's article published in the Guangming Daily, it is completely different from what he said that night. Therefore, I must ask Bojun to explain clearly.
    I suspect that Bojun is also "not firm enough and has a vague understanding" in this ideological struggle, as he said in his article? Does Bojun also have two sets of practices, one set is spoken in front of the masses, and the other set is spoken behind their backs?
    The People's Daily had a large-character headline yesterday: "Noteworthy trends of the China Democratic League." Yes, the people of the whole country are closely watching the movements of our China Democratic League Central Committee in the current ideological struggle. We are all leaders of the China Democratic League Central Committee. We can no longer shield those who have different ideas about the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. Today, at the league meeting, I ask Bojun to express his position and attitude. Luo Longji is now abroad. When he returns, I also hope that he can make an explanation.

### 希望章伯钧罗隆基表明立场  史良在民盟中央小组座谈会上的发言

　　希望章伯钧罗隆基表明立场
　　史良在民盟中央小组座谈会上的发言
    司法工作的缺点不容忽视
    明知错了不肯承认错误
    忽视法学人员随意闲置
    为了帮助我们的领导党整风，我在统战部召开的座谈会上，已经提出过意见，现在再说一点。
    关于司法工作，我认为的确这几年来成绩是巨大的，为人民作了很多事情，但缺点和错误是不容忽视的。审判机关历年来在“三反”、“五反”和镇反运动中，是错判了一些案件，可是，我常听见一些司法干部、甚至一些较负责的党员干部说：“我们的错判案件只有百分之几。”这是一种非常有害的自满情绪。诚然，错判案件在整个判案数中是只有百分之几，甚至百分之一，但对被错判的人则是百分之百的遭受冤屈和不幸了。我是拥护毛主席关于“有反必肃、有错必纠”的指示的，我看见很多地方是这样作了。但是我看到也有些司法机关在执行这一原则中是有打折扣的。有的案件判错了，经过当事人申请，甚至有关方面和上级司法机关的指出，审判人员也明知错了，但不肯承认错误，宣告无罪释放，还要硬找人家一点小辫子，宣判为“教育释放”，其实应教育的不是无辜被告而正是主观主义的审判人员自己。更坏的是本来错了，还迟迟不愿改正，使被屈的人不能得到及时的平反。这是不能容忍的。其次，在对待我国原有的法学家上也是有缺点的。在高等学校院系调整中，在思想改造中，在司法改革中，对待有些老教授们是很不尊重的。当然，必须肯定，一切法律都是为阶级服务的，所有旧法人员是必须经过改造的。但是对一切愿意改造和批判自己旧法观点，并愿意为我国社会主义服务的法学工作者也应给予机会，使能发挥其作用。可是，在院系调整中，不少地方曾对某些教授在一个相当长期内，既不安排工作，又不组织学习，闲置一旁，无人理会，形同坐冷板櫈。有的即使安排了工作，也有安排不当的，或者无法发挥其潜力的。我认为这是由于某些共产党员的官僚主义和宗派情绪，因而对本想在共产党领导下为我国法学贡献力量而又不能发挥潜力的教授们的苦楚心情，是领会不够的。因此，我们认为对原有教授和法学家们愿为社会主义法制服务的热忱及其潜力，应有恰如其分的估计，并进一步发挥他们应有的作用。
    现在再就目前整风运动发生的新情况和我们盟应当采取的态度提一点意见。
　　现在民主党派中有这样一种人：
　　一面表示赞成社会主义
　　一面反对无产阶级专政
    这次共产党党内的整风是我们国家政治生活中的重大事件。整风运动的目的是要整掉在共产党内存在的歪风邪风，从而加强党在国家事务中的核心领导作用。加强人民民主专政，使我国的社会主义建设事业突飞猛进。这个目的是必然会达到的。除此以外，整风运动和党外人士的提意见到目前为止，已经发生一种新的情况，那就是暴露了右派的反共反社会主义的真面目，从而在人民群众中间展开了一场激烈的政治思想斗争，这场斗争的一方面是拥护社会主义，拥护党的领导，另一方面是反对社会主义，反对党的领导，而要叫资本主义和资产阶级的“民主自由主义”死灰复燃。
    现在在我们民主党派中间发现了这样的一种人：一面表示赞成社会主义，另一面反对无产阶级专政，硬说工人阶级领导的人民民主专政是官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源；一面表示接受共产党领导，另一面诬蔑共产党存着“党天下”“家天下的清一色”思想；一面说是帮助共产党整风，另一面散播诋毁共产党辱骂党的领导人的言论，挑拨和煽动人民对党和政府的恶感。对于这样一种言论和行动，这几天已经激起了工人、农民、学生群众和社会人士的义愤，我们民主党派的成员和领导人有责任要加以尽量揭发批判，把他们的真正面目充分暴露在群众面前，以达到分清是非，教育群众的目的。这也是我们帮助党整风所必须担当起来的一项重要工作。
    同志们！你们一定都明白，我所说的那种人是谁？那就是储安平，还有公开和暗地支持储安平的那一些人。
    必须和储安平划清界限
    支持他的人应当站出来
    上次座谈会上，邓初民同志建议民盟中央应该对储安平的发言，表明态度。我完全同意，我作为民盟负责人之一，我要公开声明，储安平的整篇发言论点是彻底反共反人民反社会主义的。我们国家以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础，是宪法所保障的；我们的国家领导人是通过民主程序，由全国人民代表大会选举出来的。储安平是民盟盟员，是光明日报总编辑，是全国人民代表大会的代表，他曾经庄严地举手通过中华人民共和国宪法，并且参加了国家领导人的选举。他现在公开反对他自己参与的全国人民代表大会的决定，并且把责任推给全国人民所拥护爱戴的毛主席和周总理，诬蔑毛主席和周总理有“党天下”的清一色思想。这不是要挑拨煽动全国人民对领导我们的党和毛主席周总理引起恶感，还是什么呢？这不是反共反人民反社会主义，还是什么呢？
    已经有人这样说：储安平敢于作这样反动的言论，要是背后没有大力者加以支持是不可设想的。因此我主张我们民盟中央必须明确表示，和储安平划清界限，如果我们中间有谁支持储安平的，应当公开站出来。我们容许批评，也容许反批评，这才是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法。要使人民内部矛盾不转变成对抗性的矛盾，也只有通过公开的批评反批评的方式才有可能。我们反对当面一套背后又一套的阴险作法。
    章伯钧是认识模糊呢？
    还是背后另有一套呢？
    在这里我要向章伯钧副主席提一点意见。在上次中央小组座谈会上，伯钧的发言中，对储安平的批评，我认为是很不够的，是含糊其词、模棱两可的。昨天看到伯钧在光明日报上所写的文章，对储安平的批评，态度和立场仍然是不够明确的。虽然伯钧的文章里说：“储安平的反社会主义的错误言论，丝毫也不能代表光明日报。他的‘党天下’的论调是和光明日报的立场完全背谬的。”但是伯钧并没有说明他自己对储安平的发言，采取什么态度？也并没有分析储安平的发言的错误在那里？充其量，伯钧只声明了储安平的发言不能代表光明日报，而没有说明储安平是在散布反党反社会主义的论调，企图“达到从根本上动摇人民民主专政和党的领导，破坏社会主义事业”。总而言之，伯钧对储安平发言的批评，并没有接触到问题的本质。我要问伯钧，你是不是也有所顾虑，所以故意含糊其词，或者你是真的不明白储安平发言的本质呢？
    储安平的发言，是以光明日报总编辑的身份发表的。伯钧是光明日报社长，社长应当负报社的政治责任，因此储安平这一篇发言在事前是否向伯钧请示商量，发表以后伯钧有没有向他追问，你有没有向他表示过同意或者不同意他的意见。像这样的关键性问题，我认为伯钧是有责任向大家交代清楚的。
    记得上星期六晚间（6月8日），伯钧来找我谈话，我是问过伯钧的。我问他储安平的发言稿，事前和你商量过没有？他说“没有，罗隆基是看过。”伯钧又说：“有人对我说，储安平的话击中了要害。但我看是用不着写社论的。而且一再掮出卢郁文来，卢郁文这种人不过是一个小丑而已。我看，胡风、储安平倒要成为历史人物，所谓历史人物要几百年后自有定评。”当时伯钧说这样的话，我真不明白是什么意思。现在看了伯钧在光明日报发表的文章，和他在那天晚上所讲的话完全不同。因此我必须请伯钧说个明白。
    我怀疑伯钧是不是也像在你的文章中所说的那样，在这次思想斗争中“不够坚定，认识模糊”了呢？是不是伯钧也有两套做法，在群众面前讲的是一套，在背后讲的又是一套呢？
    前天人民日报大字标题写着：“可注意的民盟动向”。不错，全国人民正在密切注视我们民盟中央在目前这场思想斗争中的动向。我们都是民盟中央领导人。十目所视，十手所指，我们再不能对于对社会主义的道路和党的领导心怀异志的那些人有所包庇了。今天我在盟的会议上要求伯钧表明立场和态度。罗隆基现在出国，等到他回来以后，我也希望他能够有所交代。
