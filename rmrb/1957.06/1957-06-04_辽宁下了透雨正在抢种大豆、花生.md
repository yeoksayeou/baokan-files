Liaoning Experiences Soaking Rain, Rushing to Plant Soybeans and Peanuts

(Our Newspaper) The Liaoning Provincial Flood and Drought Relief Headquarters said on the 1st: Continuous widespread rainfall has occurred in various parts of Liaoning. Except for two counties in the northern and western regions where the rainfall was relatively small, all other areas have received sufficient rainfall. These rains are extremely beneficial to spring planting work in Liaoning Province. Now, various places are taking advantage of the post-rain conditions to actively plant. Yixian County mobilized more than 7,000 ploughs and over 50,000 people to rush to plant crops on the very day the rain stopped, and it is expected that soybeans and peanuts can be completely planted within three or four days. Haicheng County has now completed more than 90% of its total planting task. Because rainfall has been scarce near the counties of Luda, the party and government leading organs of each county have mobilized office cadres and troops to help farmers rush to plant.

    辽宁下了透雨正在抢种大豆、花生
    本报讯　辽宁省抗旱指挥部在1日说：辽宁各地连日普遍降雨，除北部和西部地区有两个县的雨量较小外，其他各地都已得到了充足的雨水。这几场雨水对于辽宁省的春耕播种工作有着极大的好处，现在各地正趁雨后积极播种。义县在雨止的当天，就出动了七千多付犁杖，五万多人抢种庄稼，预计在三、四天内可全部播完大豆、花生。海城县现在已完成了全部播种任务的90％以上。旅大附近几个县由于雨水很少，各县党、政领导机关已动员了机关干部、部队帮助农民抢种。
