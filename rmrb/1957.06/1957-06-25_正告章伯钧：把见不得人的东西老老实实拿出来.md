　　A Stern Warning to Zhang Bojun:
　　Honestly Reveal Your Shady Deeds

　　After Zhang Bojun published the fallacies of a "political design institute" and discussing "finished products," like the reactionary statements of other right-wing elements, it aroused the angry condemnation of the broad masses of people. Consequently, he began to realize somewhat that he had overestimated his own "potential," and that the prestige of the Communist Party among the broad masses of people was so solid and unshakable. Therefore, his tactics tended to be "retreating to advance." First, he repeatedly expressed his support for the leadership of the Communist Party, making light of his own fallacies in his explanations. Then, he repeatedly stated that "perhaps" his "position in political life is not suitable for raising these issues." On June 14th, we finally saw his so-called self-criticism in the People's Daily.

　　However, anyone can see that this self-criticism of three or four hundred words is extremely empty in content. Apart from general criticisms such as "unstable stance," "vague understanding," and "treating the country's policies with an extremely unserious liberal attitude," we have not seen Zhang Bojun say a single word of his true intentions. Why doesn't he talk about his conversation with Shi Liang? Why doesn't he properly criticize his ideas of setting up an "upper house," taking the opportunity to grab power, and vying with the Communist Party for leadership?

　　The time has come! Zhang Bojun must honestly conduct self-criticism. Otherwise, he himself will inevitably become a "historical figure" like Hu Feng and Chu Anping, who is forever spurned by the people. A stern warning to Zhang Bojun: Saying one thing in public and another in private; raising your hand in agreement at the table but engaging in slander behind your back; this tactic is not going to work and cannot be concealed in front of the broad masses of people who are awake today. In the past, under the leadership of the Communist Party, you participated in the democratic revolution and made certain contributions, which the people will not easily forget. But this must not be used as your political capital to oppose socialism! The time has come! You must honestly criticize the set of shady things behind your back!

### 正告章伯钧：把见不得人的东西老老实实拿出来

　　正告章伯钧：
　　把见不得人的东西老老实实拿出来
    章伯钧在发表了“政治设计院”和讨论“成品”的谬论以后，像其他右派分子的反动言论一样，引起了广大人民群众的愤怒声讨，于是，他多多少少开始觉到对自己的“潜力”估计过高，而共产党在广大人民群众中的威信是如此的巩固而不可动摇，于是，他的战术就有了“以退为进”的倾向。先是一再表示拥护共产党的领导，对自己的谬论做避重就轻的解释。继而一再表示“也许”他“在政治生活中所处的地位，不适宜于提这些问题”。6月14日，我们终于在人民日报上看到了他的所谓检讨。
    然而，任何人都可以看得出：这三四百个字的检讨，内容是极其空洞的。除去“立场不稳”、“认识模糊”和“以十分不严肃的自由主义态度，对待国家的政策”等等笼统的检讨以外，我们没有看见章伯钧把心里的真打算说出一句来。为什么他不把和史良的谈话说出来呢？为什么不把搞个“上议院”、乘机捞一把和向共产党争领导权的思想好好检讨一下呢？
    是时候了！章伯钧必须老老实实地检讨。否则，他自己也难免成为被人民永远唾弃的像胡风、储安平那样的“历史人物”。正告章伯钧：人前一套，人后一套；在桌面上举手赞成，背地里进行诽谤；这套手法在今天觉悟了的广大人民群众的面前是行不开的，也是掩藏不了的。你过去在共产党的领导下，参加过民主革命，有一定的功劳，人民群众不会轻易忘记。但这绝不能被用来当做你反对社会主义的政治资本！是时候了！必须把你背后的那一套见不得人的东西老老实实检讨出来！
