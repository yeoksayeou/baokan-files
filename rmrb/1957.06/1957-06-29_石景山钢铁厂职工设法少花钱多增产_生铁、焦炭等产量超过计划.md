Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have comprehensively exceeded the first half of the year's state plan five days ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of June, the total value of production for the first half of the year will exceed the plan by 1.63 million yuan; pig iron production will exceed the plan by 5,800 tons, coke by 6,300 tons, and cast pipes by 1,400 tons.

This year, the decline in quality and the increase in prices of the main production raw materials, as well as the state's inability to increase funding for technical organizational measures, have brought great difficulties to the plant's production. However, in the increased production and conservation movement, the plant's workers came up with many ways to overcome these difficulties. When discussing the state plan, the workers put forward more than 1,800 suggestions for increasing production and saving money without spending money or spending very little. During the increase in production, many new technologies and operating methods were promoted. For example, in the production of sintered ore, a major factor in increasing pig iron production, workers improved operating methods without spending a penny, increasing daily output by more than 22 tons. At the same time, the completion and commissioning of a reconstructed sintering project was advanced by 15 days, further increasing the plant's sintering ore production capacity by 15%. In this way, although the quality of the ore declined, the increase in sintered ore production led to an increase of more than 2,000 tons of pig iron.

In order to adapt to the new situation of raw material changes, blast furnace workers and engineers conducted physical performance tests on the new ore, mastered the ore's smelting performance, and changed the charging sequence, ensuring smooth furnace production. Because the ore production area is far away, the technical supply department sent personnel to the mine to strengthen contact, ensuring that the ore was transported to the plant in a timely manner. In order to solve the problem of declining iron content in the ore, many workers' families also actively organized to help the factory collect scrap iron, which increased pig iron production by 1,000 tons.

### 石景山钢铁厂职工设法少花钱多增产  生铁、焦炭等产量超过计划

　　石景山钢铁厂职工设法少花钱多增产
    生铁、焦炭等产量超过计划
    据新华社28日讯　石景山钢铁厂提前五天全面超额完成了上半年国家计划。预计到6月底，上半年生产总值将超过计划一百六十三万元；生铁超产五千八百吨，焦炭超产六千三百吨，铸管超产一千四百吨。
    今年主要生产原料质量下降、价格增高，以及国家不能增加技术组织措施费用，给这个厂今年的生产带来很大困难。但是全厂职工在增产节约运动中，想出了很多办法来克服困难。职工们在讨论国家计划的时候，提出了一千八百多条不花钱或花钱很少就能增产节约的建议；在增产中，推行了许多新技术和新操作方法。例如在增产生铁的主要因素——烧结矿的生产方面，职工们不花一文钱改进了操作方法以后，每日产量增加二十二吨多；同时，还把一座改建的烧结工程提前十五天完工投入生产，又使全厂烧结矿生产能力提高15％。这样，矿石质量虽然下降，但是因为增产了烧结矿，便增产了两千多吨生铁。
    为了适应原料变化的新情况，高炉工人和工程师们，对新矿石进行物理性能试验，掌握了矿石冶炼性能，并且改变装料次序，保证了炉子顺利生产。由于矿石产地远，技术供应部门特别派人到矿山去加强联系，保证了把矿石及时运进厂内。为了解决矿石含铁量下降的问题，许多职工家属也积极组织起来帮助工厂拣废铁，这使生铁增产了一千吨。
