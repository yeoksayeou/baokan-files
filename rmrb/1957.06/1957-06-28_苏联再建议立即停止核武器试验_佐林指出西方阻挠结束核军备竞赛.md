　　The Soviet Union Again Proposes an Immediate Halt to Nuclear Weapons Tests
    Zorin Points Out that the West Obstructs the End of the Nuclear Arms Race
    According to Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, London dispatch: The United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee continued its meeting on June 26th. Soviet representative Zorin had already stated at the meeting the previous day that he was prepared to immediately sign an agreement to halt the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, provided that the other two atomic powers, the United States and Britain, also agreed. Zorin also expressed regret that the U.S. representative did not intend to study the Soviet proposal to immediately suspend nuclear weapons tests for two or three years.
    However, sources revealed that at the June 26th meeting, the Western representatives were still unwilling to discuss the immediate cessation of testing.
    Zorin pointed out on the 25th that the Western countries' representatives proposed stopping the production of fissionable materials for military purposes as a prerequisite for stopping the tests, which is actually complicating the resolution of the problem of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons with artificial obstacles. Zorin said that the committee's representatives must listen to the calls from the public in all countries for an immediate halt to nuclear weapons tests.
    Zorin pointed out that while the West proposed that stopping tests should depend on the issue of stopping the production of fissionable materials for military purposes, it also hindered reaching an agreement on the complete prohibition and elimination of atomic and hydrogen weapons, including stopping the production of fissionable materials for military purposes. This is actually obstructing the end of the nuclear arms race.
    U.S. representative Stassen proposed a plan to reduce armed forces in three stages at the meeting on the 25th.
    Zorin asked Stassen: What political conditions will the second and third stages of reduction depend on? Zorin said that if we consider that the negotiations on the first stage of reducing armed forces and armaments have already lasted for many years, then if we have to hold new negotiations after each stage, I am afraid that not only our sons, but even our grandsons, will not live to see these three stages of armed forces reduction realized one by one.
    The June 26th meeting discussed a part of the disarmament plan proposed by the United States: In the first stage, countries will reduce armaments according to a jointly agreed list and send the surplus armaments to warehouses under international supervision.

### 苏联再建议立即停止核武器试验  佐林指出西方阻挠结束核军备竞赛

　　苏联再建议立即停止核武器试验
    佐林指出西方阻挠结束核军备竞赛
    据新华社27日讯  伦敦消息：联合国裁军小组委员会6月26日继续开会。苏联代表佐林已经在前一天的会议上再次声明，他准备立即签订停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协定，只要其他两个原子强国美国和英国也同意。佐林并且对美国代表不打算研究苏联关于立即暂停核武器试验两、三年的建议表示遗憾。
    但是，消息透露，在26日会议上，西方代表仍然不愿谈论立即停止试验的问题。
    佐林在25日指出，西方国家的代表提出以停止为军事目的生产分裂物质作为停止试验的先决条件，这实际上是以人为的阻碍条件来使解决停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题复杂化。佐林说，委员会的代表们必须倾听各国公众要求立即停止核武器试验的呼声。
    佐林指出，西方一方面提出来停止试验要取决于停止为军事目的生产分裂物质问题，另一方面又阻碍就完全禁止和取消原子武器和氢武器，包括停止为军事目的生产分裂物质达成协议。这实际上是在阻挠结束核武器竞赛。
    美国代表史塔生在25日会议上提出了分三个阶段裁减武装部队的计划。
    佐林问史塔生：第二第三阶段的裁减要取决于怎样的政治条件。佐林说，如果考虑到裁减武装部队和军备的第一阶段谈判已经延续多年，那么如果我们在每一阶段以后还要举行新的谈判，我想恐怕不但我们的儿子，就是我们的孙子也不能活着看到这三个裁减武装部队阶段一一实现。
    26日会议上曾讨论了美国提出的裁军计划里的一项内容：各国在第一阶段按照共同协议的清单裁减军备，并且把多余的军备送到受国际监督的仓库里去。
