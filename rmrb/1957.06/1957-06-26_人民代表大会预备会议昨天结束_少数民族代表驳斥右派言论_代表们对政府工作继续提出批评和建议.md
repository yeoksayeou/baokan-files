Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The preparatory meeting for the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress concluded today.

　　Today, many representative groups continued to discuss Chairman Mao Zedong's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"; some representative groups held discussions on Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft state budget and final accounts, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft national economic annual plan, both of which are to be submitted to the Congress for discussion. The representatives also offered some opinions on various aspects of the country's work.

　　Minority Nationalities Firmly Take the Socialist Road; Cannot Leave the Leadership of the Communist Party for Even a Moment
    During the discussion of Chairman Mao's report, in the representative groups from Tibet, Qamdo, Qinghai, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Gansu, many minority nationality representatives today refuted the rightists' statements against socialism and against the leadership of the Communist Party.

    In the Tibet and Qamdo representative group, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that before liberation, the various minority nationalities of China were in a state of dispersion, disunity, and lack of unity, and the people's lives were difficult. After liberation, the construction undertakings in various minority areas have greatly developed, and all nationalities and within nationalities are united. In recent years, the social development and progress in the Tibet area is something that has not happened in the more than one thousand years of relations between Tibet and the interior. He said that this is the result of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. With the leadership of the Communist Party, all minority nationalities have a future for development. Therefore, he believes that the remarks calling for the abolition of the Communist Party's leadership and opposing the socialist cause are wrong.

    Guan Baojia (Mongolian), the head of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said that since liberation, the number of livestock in the Haixi area has increased by more than one and a half times, and the number of schools has increased from three to more than twenty. The lives of people of all ethnic groups have generally improved. He said that the leadership of the Communist Party is something that minority nationalities cannot leave for even a moment. Xiraojiatso (Tibetan), Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, said that what the Communist Party does in one day, the Kuomintang could not do in a thousand years. Our minority nationalities are determined to take the socialist road, and it is only wishful thinking for the rightists to try to lead us onto the capitalist road. Zhao Shitong, Director of the Baise Prefectural Work Committee of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province, said that in recent years, the living standards of the Zhuang people in Guangxi Province have greatly improved. The average purchasing power per person in the Baise Prefecture was only 13 yuan in 1952, but it increased to 33 yuan in 1956. Now, the equality and friendship between all nationalities is unprecedented. Other minority nationality representatives in their speeches also believed that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no national unity and national equality. Therefore, the leadership of the Communist Party is unshakable.

    Pei Aqian, the head of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, said that in their autonomous prefecture, if anyone said that the leadership of the Communist Party was not good and wanted the Communist Party to step down, the people would tie up that person. Pei Aqian said that the Kuomintang ruled them for decades. At that time, the people ate banana leaves and wild vegetables. Everything that pigs could eat, people ate. They had no clothes to wear and families were broken up. After liberation, people had land, and the government also taught farmers how to fertilize and weed, and brought them various farm tools. Now, water fields have been opened in the autonomous region, and agricultural production cooperatives have been established on a trial basis. People eat well and can eat dry rice, have clothes to wear and quilts to cover themselves with, and have primary and secondary schools. Everyone feels that only with the leadership of the Communist Party can there be a way out.

　　The Lives of Workers and Peasants Are Gradually Improving; Rightist Rumors Will Not Achieve Their Goal
    Many representatives from factories and rural areas in the Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi representative groups refuted the rightists' claim that life today is not as good as it used to be, using the changes in life before and after liberation. Meng Tai, an industrial labor model and representative from Anshan City, said that the workers in the repair shop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, which he leads, expressed their opposition after hearing this fallacy. When Meng Tai recalled the oppression and exploitation he suffered in the old society, he pointed to a scar on his eyebrow and said, "This is the living memorial left to me by the Japanese invaders. Is this kind of life worth my missing? Only those who used to live by oppressing and exploiting others would say that life today is not as good as it used to be, because their lives of oppressing and cruelly exploiting people are gone." Agricultural labor models Zhang Wenchun, Tong Yulan, and Liu Hongda from this province cited many examples of continuous increases in production in their agricultural cooperatives and gradual improvements in the lives of farmers, refuting fallacies such as "farmers' lives are hard," "agricultural cooperatives have no superiority," and "unified purchase and sale has messed things up."

    In the Heilongjiang Province representative group, industrial labor model Su Changyou said that, taking construction workers as an example, before liberation, more than 50% of them had no homes, and many workers were unemployed. When Japan ruled the Northeast, the money earned by construction workers in a year was not enough to support their wives and children. Now, more than 80% of construction workers have families. Before liberation, no one looked up to construction workers, and few construction workers were literate. Taking him as an example, he couldn't even recognize the invitations people gave him in 1951. Now, most construction workers have at least a primary school education. In the past, construction workers built tall buildings for others, but after they were built, they couldn't even enter the door. Now, construction workers also live in tall buildings. He said that the rightists want to obliterate the achievements of the Party's work. They are simply closing their eyes and talking nonsense, and they will not achieve their goal.

    Today, many representatives continued to express their opinions or offer criticisms on various aspects of the government's work during the discussions, and they also put forward many suggestions.

    In the Jiangsu Province representative group, Xue Muqiao pointed out in his speech that some people say that "last year's work was rash." This statement is not in line with the facts and is also harmful. Last year, China's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory, and the achievements in industry, agriculture, and other aspects were enormous, and people's lives also improved. Of course, there were also some errors and shortcomings that need to be examined and corrected. However, if we say that last year was rash, exaggerate the shortcomings, and minimize the achievements, it will hurt the enthusiasm of the working people across the country and be very unfavorable to socialist construction. He believes that this session of the National People's Congress should affirm the achievements and criticize the shortcomings in a realistic manner, and should play a role in inspiring the working people across the country.

    Advocate Mass Schooling, Increase Children's Films, and Pay Attention to Changing the Backwardness of Education in Border Areas

    Some representatives from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region representative group suggested that the government could consider appropriately increasing investment in basic construction in minority areas in terms of culture, education, and health in this year's budget. Lu Han, a representative from Yunnan Province, suggested that the Ministry of Education strengthen its leadership over general education and teacher training in Yunnan Province to change the backwardness of education in border areas.

    Zhou Xinmin, a representative from Anhui Province and Deputy Mayor of Shenyang City, particularly emphasized the importance of advocating mass schooling. He said that in Shenyang City, if we follow the national enrollment plan, the number of children who can enter school in Shenyang City this year accounts for 65% of the city's school-age children. However, because Shenyang City began to mobilize factory and mining masses to run schools themselves in February this year, the enrollment rate of school-age children may reach 92%.

    Yuan Rong, a primary school teacher and representative from Shanghai City, criticized the lack of children's films when talking about children's education issues, especially the lack of good educational films suitable for children. He Luting, a musician and representative from Shanghai City, said that radio stations and record companies pay composers, singers, and performers too little when broadcasting music and making records, which is very unreasonable and should be paid according to work. He also suggested that the state purchase excellent musical works to encourage musical creation.

    Lu Zhenyu, a historian and representative from Changchun City, hopes that the leaders of the Higher Education Department and the Ministry of Education will go deep into the schools to solve some specific problems in school education so as to better guide the national education work.

    Yu Aifeng, a well-known obstetrician and gynecologist and representative from Tianjin City, suggested that the government change the enterprise nature of medical units and gradually manage them as welfare undertakings. She said that the enterprise nature of medical units has three major evils: first, medical expenses are too high, and patients bear too much burden; second, in order to increase profits, hospitals require doctors to rush to complete tasks; now, each doctor has to see an average of seven or eight patients per hour, which affects the quality of medical care; third, the addition of medical equipment and the improvement of medical personnel are subject to undue restrictions.

    At the meeting of the Beijing City representative group, many representatives raised opinions on the current housing problem. Liang Sicheng, an architect, believes that the current housing policy is unreasonable, mainly because the rent standards for cadres and employees are too low. He also cited many specific examples to illustrate this problem. He suggested that all residential houses of all agencies and enterprises in the city should be managed by the Real Estate Administration Bureau, the rent should be appropriately increased, and the recovered rent should be used for repairs every year, and some new houses can also be built.

    Xing Zhaotang, a representative from Gansu Province, said that some grassroots units do not pay much attention to statistical work now, and some statistical figures are inaccurate, causing confusion in the country's statistical work. He suggested that investigation and statistical work should be strengthened in the future.

    Su Qianyi, a representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, believes that the quality of basic construction projects should be given special attention. He suggested that projects with good quality should be rewarded. Many representatives from the Inner Mongolia group also raised opinions on the country's wage system (especially the wage issue of township cadres), public medical care, and welfare subsidies. They believe that the phenomenon of everything being covered by the state is not good and should be improved in the future.

    In the discussions of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang representative groups, some representatives talked about the issue of ideological remolding. Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations and a representative from Jiangsu Province, said that ideological remolding should not be rushed or delayed, but we should strive for time. The socialist cause is developing rapidly, and thinking must keep up, otherwise it will lag behind.

    Wu Yifang, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, believes that ideological remolding is mainly self-remolding; the bad things hidden in the depths of the mind must be dug out by oneself. In her opinion, many intellectuals have not done the first thing in ideological remolding, which is to destroy bourgeois ideology and establish socialist ideology. They have not criticized what they learned from the bourgeoisie, so new positions, new ideas, and new views have not been established; given the opportunity, the old things will come back to life.

    At today's meeting, the Jiangxi and other representative groups also discussed the issue of the election of representatives to the next National People's Congress.

　　人民代表大会预备会议昨天结束
    少数民族代表驳斥右派言论
    代表们对政府工作继续提出批评和建议
    新华社25日讯  全国人民代表大会第四次会议预备会议今天结束。
    今天，许多代表小组继续讨论了毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告；有些代表小组座谈了准备提交大会讨论的李先念副总理关于国家预算决算（草案）的报告和薄一波副总理关于国民经济年度计划（草案）的报告。代表们并就国家各方面的工作提出了一些意见。
　　少数民族坚决走社会主义道路  一时一刻不能离开共产党领导
    在讨论毛主席报告时，西藏、昌都、青海、云南、广西和甘肃等代表小组，今天有不少少数民族代表驳斥了右派分子的反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的言论。
    在西藏、昌都代表小组，阿沛·阿旺晋美说，在解放以前，中国各少数民族处于分散、不团结和不统一的状态，人民生活困苦。解放后，各少数民族地区建设事业都有了很大发展，各民族之间和民族内部都团结起来了。几年来，西藏地区社会的发展和进步是从西藏和内地发生关系一千多年来所没有的。他说，这是中国共产党领导的结果。有了共产党的领导，各少数民族才有发展的前途。因此，他认为那种要取消共产党领导和反对社会主义事业的言论是错误的。
    青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克自治州州长官保加（蒙古族）说，解放以来，海西地区牲畜增加了一倍半以上，学校由三所发展到二十多所，各族人民生活普遍提高。他说，共产党的领导对少数民族来说，是一时一刻不能离开的。中国佛教协会副会长、青海省副省长喜饶嘉错（藏族）说，共产党一天做的事情，国民党一千年也做不出来。我们少数民族坚决走社会主义道路，右派分子想把我们引上资本主义道路，只是妄想。广西省桂西僮族自治州百色专区工作委员会主任赵世同说，几年来，广西省僮族人民的生活水平有了很大提高。百色专区每人的平均购买力，在1952年只有十三元，到1956年就提高到三十三元。现在，各民族之间的平等、友爱是史无前例的。其他少数民族代表在发言中也都认为，没有共产党的领导，就没有民族团结和民族平等。因此，共产党的领导是不可动摇的。
    云南省怒江傈僳族自治州州长裴阿欠说，在他们的自治州里，如果有谁说共产党的领导不好，要共产党下台，老百姓就会把这种人捆起来。裴阿欠说，国民党统治他们几十年，那时，老百姓吃芭蕉叶和野菜，凡是猪能吃的人都吃，也没有衣服穿，妻离子散。解放以后，人们有了地，政府还教农民施肥、锄草，给他们运来了各种农具，现在自治区里开了水田，试办了农业生产合作社，人们吃得饱，而且可以吃干饭，有衣穿、有被盖，有了小学和中学。大家都觉得只有共产党领导，才有活路。
　　工农生活正逐步改善  右派造谣达不到目的
    辽宁、黑龙江和陕西等代表小组中许多来自工厂农村的代表，都以解放前后的生活变化，驳斥右派分子所谓现在生活赶不上过去的说法。鞍山市代表、工业劳动模范孟泰说，他领导的鞍钢炼铁厂修理场的工人听到这种谬论后，纷纷表示反对。孟泰在回忆旧社会时期他所受的压迫和剥削时，指着他眉头上的一块疤痕说：“这就是日本侵略者给我留下的生活纪念，这种生活值得我留恋吗？只有那些过去靠压迫别人、剥削别人过活的人，才说今天的生活不如过去，因为他们压迫人、残酷剥削人的生活没有了。”这个省的农业劳动模范张文春、佟玉兰和刘洪达等，举出他们所在的农业社生产连年增加、农民生活逐年提高的大量事例，驳斥所谓“农民生活苦”、“农业社没有优越性”、“统购统销搞糟了”等谬论。
    在黑龙江省代表组，工业劳动模范苏长有说，拿建筑工人来说，解放以前无家的占50％以上，很多工人失业。日本统治东北时，建筑工人一年挣的钱连老婆孩子都养不活，现在有家的建筑工人占80％以上。解放前谁也看不起建筑工人，建筑工人很少识字的，拿他来说，1951年人家给他的请帖他都不大认识。现在，大部分建筑工人都有了小学以上的文化程度。过去建筑工人是给人家盖大楼，盖完了连门也进不去，现在建筑工人也住上大楼了。他说，右派分子想抹煞党的工作成就，他们硬是闭着眼睛说瞎话，他们是达不到目的的。
    今天有许多代表在讨论中继续对政府各方面的工作发表了意见或提出批评，并且提出了许多建议。
    在江苏省代表小组，薛暮桥在发言中指出，有人说“去年工作冒进了”，这种说法是不符事实的，也是有害的。在去年，我国社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利，工业、农业及其他各方面的成绩都是巨大的，人民生活也是有改善的。当然，也有一些错误和缺点，需要检查改正。但是，如果说去年冒进，夸大缺点，缩小成绩，将会伤害全国劳动人民的积极性，对社会主义建设非常不利。他认为这次全国人民代表大会会议应该实事求是地肯定成绩批评缺点，对全国劳动人民要起鼓舞作用。
    提倡群众办学，增加儿童影片，注意改变边疆教育的落后状况
    新疆维吾尔自治区代表小组有的代表建议政府在今年的预算中，可考虑适当增加少数民族地区文教卫生方面基本建设的投资。云南省代表卢汉建议教育部加强对云南省普通教育和师范教育的领导，改变边疆教育的落后状况。
    安徽省代表、沈阳市副市长周新民特别提出提倡群众办学的重要性。他说，在沈阳市，如果按照国家招生计划，今年沈阳市能够入学的儿童占全市学龄儿童的65％。但是，由于沈阳市在今年2月间就开始发动厂矿群众自己办学，使学龄儿童的入学比例可能达到92％。
    上海市代表、小学教师袁瑢在谈到儿童教育问题时，批评儿童影片太少，适合儿童看的有教育意义的好影片尤其少。上海市代表、音乐家贺绿汀说，广播电台播送音乐、唱片厂灌制唱片时给作曲者、演唱者和演奏者报酬太低，很不合理，应该按劳付酬。他还建议由国家收购优秀的音乐作品，以鼓励音乐创作。
    长春市代表、历史学家吕振羽希望高等教育部和教育部的负责人深入学校，解决学校教育工作中的一些具体问题，以便更好地指导全国教育工作。
    天津市代表、著名妇产科医生俞霭峰建议政府改变医疗单位的企业化性质，逐步地作为福利事业来加以管理。她说，医疗单位的企业化有三大恶果：第一是医药费用太高，患者负担过重。第二是医院为了增加上缴利润，就要求医生赶任务；现在每个医生平均每小时要看七、八个病人，影响医疗质量。第三是对医疗设备的增添、医务人员的改善都受到了不应有的限制。
    在北京市代表小组会上，许多代表对目前住房问题提出了意见。建筑学家梁思成认为现在的房屋政策不合理，主要表现在干部和职工住房的房租标准过低。他并举出许多具体事例说明这个问题。他建议把城市所有机关、企业的居住房屋统统交房产管理局管理，适当提高租金，每年用收回的房租进行修缮，并且可以新建一些住宅。
    甘肃省代表邢肇棠说，现在有些基层单位对统计工作不很重视，有些统计数字不准确，造成国家统计工作的混乱。他建议今后应加强调查统计工作。
    内蒙古自治区代表苏谦益认为，基本建设工程的质量问题应该引起特别重视。他建议对质量良好的工程给予奖励。内蒙古小组的许多代表还对国家的工资制度（特别是乡干部的工资问题）、公费医疗和福利补助等问题提出了意见。他们认为，一切由国家包下来的现象是不好的，今后应该改进。
    江苏、浙江等代表小组在讨论中，有些代表谈到了思想改造问题。江苏省代表、对外文化联络局代局长陈忠经说，思想改造既不能急，也不能拖，要争取时间。社会主义事业发展很快，思想要跟上去，否则要掉队落伍。
    江苏省副省长吴贻芳认为，思想改造主要是自我改造；隐藏在思想深处的坏东西，要靠自己去把它挖出来。在她看来，有许多知识分子在思想改造中，头一件事还没有做，那就是破资产阶级思想，立社会主义思想。他们对从资产阶级学来的东西没有进行批判，因此新的立场、新的思想和新的观点没有树立；一有机会，旧的东西就借尸还魂。
    在今天的会议上，江西等代表小组还就下届全国人民代表大会代表选举问题，进行了讨论。
