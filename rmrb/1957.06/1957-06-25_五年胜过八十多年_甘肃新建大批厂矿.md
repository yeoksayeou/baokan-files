Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th - During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, eighty-two newly built and expanded factories and mines under local management in Gansu Province have been put into production; in addition, more than a dozen large state-owned factories and mines are under construction and renovation.

By May of this year, Gansu's local industry had completed the basic construction investment plan of the First Five-Year Plan seven months ahead of schedule, with sixty-four new factories completed and eighteen factories renovated. This is a great achievement for Gansu, which has a very weak industrial base.

As early as 1870, during the late Qing Dynasty, Gansu began to establish industries such as foreign gun factories and woolen mills, but industrial development was very slow over the next eighty years. By 1952, there were only forty-eight factories and mines in the province. In the past four and a half years, the number of new factories has more than doubled.

In the past, Gansu could only be self-sufficient in a few products such as salt, water tobacco, matches, and bricks and tiles. Other industrial products such as machinery, flour, edible oil, and new-style agricultural tools mostly relied on supplies from other regions. Even everyday items such as glass cups and ink had to be transported from coastal areas thousands of miles away. Due to the commissioning of newly built and renovated factories and mines, local industry in the province has produced hundreds of new products in recent years. These include new-style agricultural tools such as boiler-camel machines, corn threshers, hillside plows, and liberation-style waterwheels. In 1955 and 1956 alone, nearly 300,000 hillside plows and liberation-style waterwheels were produced, which can fully meet the needs of farmers in arid mountainous areas and plains. In terms of daily necessities, after the completion of a number of flour mills and oil pressing plants, Gansu's flour and edible oil have gone from insufficient to surplus, and some can even be transferred to other regions. After the two newly built wool textile factories were put into production in 1954, they were able to produce finer uniforms and beautiful blankets and jacquard blankets. These products are not only very popular among the people of the province, but are also sold far and wide.

In ethnic minority areas, where there was originally very little industry, a number of factories have now emerged. For example, in the Wu Zhong and Gu Yuan Hui Autonomous Prefectures and Linxia City, more than a dozen factories and mines, such as power plants, flour mills, oil pressing plants, and coal mines, have been newly built. In the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a modern dairy factory has been completed and is undergoing trial operation. Once it is put into production soon, it can produce more than 500 tons of milk powder every year.

Before the start of the First Five-Year Plan, there were only two or three large state-owned factories in the Gansu region. Now, large industries under construction include: oil refineries, petroleum machinery factories, cement plants, thermal power plants, and coal mines. Some of these factories and mines will be completed this year, and most will be put into production successively next year. By then, the ratio of industry to agriculture in Gansu will undergo a major change.

### 五年胜过八十多年  甘肃新建大批厂矿

　　五年胜过八十多年
    甘肃新建大批厂矿
    新华社兰州24日电　在第一个五年计划期间，甘肃省已经有八十二个地方经营的新建、扩建的厂矿投入生产；另有十几座国营大厂矿正在新建和改建。
    到今年5月为止，甘肃地方工业已经提前七个月完成了第一个五年计划的基本建设投资计划，有六十四个新的厂矿建成，十八个厂矿改建完工。这在工业基础很薄弱的甘肃来说，是个很大的成就。
    早在1870年的前清时代，甘肃就开始建立洋炮局和制呢厂等工业，但在八十多年中，工业发展很慢。到1952年，全省只有四十八个厂矿。而在近四年半的时间内，新工厂就增加了一倍多。
    甘肃过去除食盐、水烟、火柴和砖瓦等少数产品能自足以外，其他如机械、面粉、食油和新式农具等工业品大部分要靠外区供应，甚至连日常用的玻璃杯、墨水等，都要从迢迢千里外的沿海地区运进。由于新建和改建厂矿的投入生产，这几年中全省地方工业生产了上百种新产品。其中有锅驼机、玉米脱粒机、山地步犁和解放式水车等新式农具。在1955年和1956年，光是山地步犁和解放式水车就生产了近三十万部，这些农具能够充分满足干旱山区和平原地区的农民需要。在生活用品方面，一批面粉厂和榨油厂建成以后，甘肃的面粉和食油已经由不足到有余，并且还能外调一部分。1954年新建的两座毛纺织厂投入生产以后，能够生产较细的制服呢和美丽的毛毯、提花毯，这些产品不但深受本省人民的欢迎，而且远销外地。
    在少数民族地区，从前本来很少有工业，现在也出现了一批工厂。如吴忠、固原回族自治州和临夏市，新建成的有电厂、面粉厂、榨油厂和煤矿等十几个厂矿。在甘南藏族自治州，一座现代化的乳品厂已经建成，正在试车运转，不久投入生产以后，每年可以生产五百多吨奶粉。
    在第一个五年计划开始以前，甘肃地区国营的大工厂只有两三个。而现在正新建的大工业有：炼油厂、石油机械厂、水泥厂、热电站、煤矿等十几个，这些厂矿有的在今年建成，大部分将在明后年陆续投入生产。到那时，甘肃的工农业比重将起重大的变化。
