　　The Current Situation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Japan
　　Lan Hai
    Since the war, Japan's industrial production has developed significantly, with the industrial scale reaching 2.4 times that of the pre-war period, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still exist widely. According to the Japanese government's business establishment statistics in July 1954, SMEs with fewer than 200 employees accounted for 99.8% of all enterprises in mining, construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail, finance and insurance, transportation and communication, and other service industries. Small businesses with fewer than five employees accounted for 80.2%. It is estimated that there are currently 16 million employed workers in Japan, and 70% of them work in scattered SMEs. SMEs occupy an important position in the Japanese economy.
    According to pre-war (1934) statistics, factories with fewer than 200 employees accounted for 98.2% of the total number of factories in Japan, and workers in these SMEs accounted for 58.2% of the total number of workers. From the post-war (1954) statistics, this situation has hardly changed: SMEs account for 98.5% of the total number of factories, and the number of workers accounts for 60.5%.
    Before the war, about 50% to 60% of Japan's exported goods were products of SMEs. Japanese monopoly capital used the cheap labor of SMEs to drastically lower workers' living standards and engage in so-called overseas dumping, using the export of SME goods to exchange for military supplies and raw materials for heavy industry to develop the militarization of the economy. After the war, the categories of Japanese exported goods differed from those before the war, with the focus shifting from light industrial products to heavy industrial products. However, the proportion of SME products in the total export value has essentially remained unchanged. For example, in the export of complete sets of equipment, which has seen a significant increase recently, most of the products are manufactured by SMEs. In the $439 million export contracts signed by the shipbuilding industry in 1955, 70% of the cost was for products manufactured by SMEs. Textiles and general merchandise are mostly produced directly by SMEs and also account for a very high proportion of export value. In the exported goods in 1955, Western tableware, toys, lacquerware, etc., were all products of SMEs. More than 90% of exported silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, textiles, knitwear, pencils, etc., were also products of SMEs. In addition, SME products account for more than 50% of major export goods such as leather products, steel building materials, asbestos products, optical glass, communication equipment, sewing machines, and paints.
    The content and management methods of SMEs are extremely complex, and the conditions for establishing enterprises are not entirely the same. Generally speaking, there are two main types of SME management: independent operation and subordinate. In terms of enterprise establishment, it can also be divided into two categories: one is the traditional rural handicrafts and manufactories before the formation of capitalism that have continued to the present with economic development and technological progress; the other is newly emerging with the development of capitalism and the development of the social division of labor.
    Some SMEs with their own production fields have difficulties in the transportation or storage of raw materials, some produce products with special needs, some products have very small actual demand, and some are complex and exquisite special handicrafts. Most of the so-called local enterprises belong to this category. There are also chemical toys or Christmas decorations, etc., which are less costly to produce by SMEs using the cheap labor of female workers and child labor in a handicraft manner than by large enterprises investing in fixed capital for production. Therefore, large enterprises simply do not interfere in these sectors.
    However, most independently operated SMEs are in a position to directly compete with large enterprises in the production field. This situation exists in almost all industries such as cotton weaving, wool weaving, bicycles, sewing machines, cameras, various pharmaceutical industries, chemical industries, or coal industries. A characteristic that can be seen in the production fields of bicycles, sewing machines, cameras, etc., is that in large enterprises, various parts are produced in assembly line operations, while in SMEs, most of the parts are purchased from outside and only assembled.
    Among the SMEs with subordinate nature, there are industries based on household handicrafts that are subordinate to distributors (such as various local textile industries, daily necessities, toy industries, etc.), and there are new types of industries based on manufactories that are subordinate to distributors (mostly mechanical equipment, metal products, and fiber products). In addition to these SMEs subordinate to commercial capital, there are also SMEs subordinate to industrial capital in the form of direct contracting.
    Not to mention SMEs that are in direct competition with large enterprises, even SMEs with their own production fields are constantly subjected to the oppression and exploitation of monopoly capital and are often on the verge of collapse. SMEs that are oppressed by monopoly capital often pass on the losses to workers; even so, many SMEs still go bankrupt because they cannot maintain themselves.
    Monopoly capital has powerful means to extract SMEs. Monopoly prices, control of raw materials, control of finance, and heavy taxes through state institutions are their main methods. In Japan under the control of monopoly capital, few SMEs are unaffected by monopoly prices. Not to mention heavy chemical industries, in light industry, except for the final finished product sectors for direct consumption, almost all sectors are also completely controlled by monopoly capital. Raising domestic prices and lowering export prices to force overseas dumping in order to gain competitive victory in overseas markets is the traditional policy of Japanese monopoly capital. The cartels that are currently publicly recognized include: copper ingots, copper wire, steel, cement, hard pottery, high-grade paper, ammonium sulfate, glycerin, paint, linen fabrics, cotton fabrics, chemical fibers, bearings, coal, etc. In addition, there are so-called "secret cartels" that disregard the Monopoly Prohibition Law, which in fact control the entire industrial sector controlled by monopoly capital.
    Recently, in the rapid development of the Japanese economy, due to the fact that Japanese prices are higher than international market prices, monopoly capital has adopted a policy of strengthening the so-called "prosperity enterprise cartels" to ensure that monopoly capital obtains relatively low-priced materials, while forcing SMEs to purchase high-priced materials on the market.
    In the case of a severe shortage of raw materials, SMEs not only have to pay high prices to purchase raw materials, but may not even be able to purchase them at all.
    Monopoly capital also places heavy pressure on SMEs in the financial sector. Banks require SMEs to pay higher interest rates than loans to large enterprises for small loans, citing the small amount of money involved. In addition, banks also claim that lending to SMEs is riskier, so they generally force SMEs to deposit a portion of their loans in the bank and require borrowers to pay interest on the original loan amount. Therefore, the actual interest borne by SMEs is much higher than the interest on the actual amount borrowed. Not only that, but the banks also allocate this withheld deposit to large enterprises, giving them preferential treatment. Originally, in addition to ordinary banks, there were also special financial institutions that specialize in lending to SMEs, such as mutual banks, the Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Corporation, the Central Bank for Commercial and Industrial Cooperatives, the National Finance Corporation, and credit associations. However, these institutions have limited capital and limited lending, and therefore cannot meet the needs of SMEs.
    Monopoly capital's large enterprises enjoy tax exemption privileges for depreciation and dividend distribution, etc., according to the "Temporary Tax Special Measures Law," but SMEs not only do not enjoy this tax exemption privilege, but their tax burden is even heavier than before the war. Taking the individual business tax, which mainly targets SMEs, as an example, the burden rate of income tax before the war (1934-1936) did not exceed 1.3% of income, but after the war, it increased to 7.3% or even 7.8%.
    In addition to using these methods to squeeze SMEs, monopoly capital has also entered the independent production fields of SMEs, which is a new feature after the war. Since last spring, the offensive of large electrical appliance manufacturers into the production of household electrical appliances, the monopolistic trend of steel monopoly enterprises in the production of thin steel sheets, the entry of large capitalists in the textile industry into the production of fiber processed products, and the entry of large oil companies into the production of cottonseed oil are all very significant and unprecedented phenomena. Through this method, monopoly capital incorporates SMEs into its system and strengthens the subordinate relationship of contract production. Although this process of incorporating SMEs into the monopoly capital system exhibits various forms due to different enterprise conditions, it is the same in strengthening the extraction of cheap labor. The wage gap between large enterprises and SMEs is also widening. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Labor, taking the wages of large enterprises with more than 500 employees as 100, the wages of SMEs with 30 to 100 employees were 67.3% in 1950, 61.8% in 1951, 58.8% in 1952, 60% in 1953, 60.1% in 1954, and 59.7% in 1955.
    Under the exploitation and plunder policies of monopoly capital, Japanese SMEs struggle to maintain their operations. They are extremely scattered, have conflicting interests, and have weak unity, and therefore cannot take effective countermeasures against the policies of monopoly capital. As long as there is a large reserve army of unemployed and the pressure of relative overpopulation, even if SMEs are squeezed out, new SMEs will continue to emerge and be incorporated into the net of exploitation of monopoly capital. For monopoly capital, SMEs are competitors, but also indispensable objects for extracting super profits.
    In order to survive, Japanese SMEs either continue to maintain the status quo on the verge of collapse, or strengthen the unity between SMEs and join hands with the working class to oppose the common enemy—monopoly capital—in order to obtain stable operations. This is the choice facing Japanese SMEs.

　　日本中小企业的现状
　　蓝海
    战后日本工业生产有了显著的发展，工业规模达到了战前的二点四倍，但中小企业仍然广泛地存在着。据1954年7月日本政府事业所统计，在矿业、建筑业、制造工业、批发零售、金融保险、运输通信以及其他包括服务行业在内的全部企业中，不满二百人的中小企业占企业总数的99.8％，工作人员不满五人的小企业占80.2％。日本的雇佣劳动者，现在估计有一千六百万人，其中70％都在零散的中小企业中工作。中小企业在日本经济中是占有重要地位的。
    据战前（1934年）的统计，不满二百人的工厂占日本工厂总数的98.2％，在这些中小工厂中工作的工人占工人总数的58.2％。从战后（1954年）的统计来看，这种状况几乎没有什么改变：中小工厂占工厂总数的98.5％，工人人数占60.5％。
    战前日本输出的商品中，约有50％到60％是中小企业的产品。日本垄断资本利用中小企业的低廉的劳动，极度压低工人的生活水准，进行所谓海外倾销，以中小企业商品的输出，换回军需资材和重工业原料用来发展经济的军事化。战后日本输出商品的类别与战前有所不同，它的中心已从轻工业品转向重工业品。但在输出总额中，中小企业产品所占的比重实质上仍然没有什么变化。例如，最近在出口方面有显著上升的成套设备的输出，产品的大部分是由中小企业制造的。1955年造船工业所签订的四亿三千九百万美元的输出合同中，占成本70％的产品也是由中小企业承制的。纺织品、杂货类大部分是由中小企业直接生产的，在输出额中也占有很高的比重。1955年出口商品中，西餐用具、玩具、漆器等全部是中小企业的制品。出口的丝织品、人造丝织品、纺织品、针织品、铅笔等90％以上也是中小企业的产品。此外主要出口商品中中小企业制品占50％以上的，还有皮革制品、钢制建筑器材、石棉制品、光学玻璃、通讯器材、缝纫机、油漆等。
    中小企业的内容和经营方式极为复杂，企业建立的条件也不尽相同。大致说来，中小企业的经营方式有两大类，可分为独立经营的和带有从属性质的。就企业建立的情况看，也可以分为两大类：一类是资本主义形成以前的传统的农村手工业和工场手工业随着经济的发展和技术的进步而延续到现在的；另一类是随着资本主义的发展，随着社会分工的发展而新产生出来的。
    具有独自生产领域的中小企业，有的在原料的运输上或保管上有困难，有的生产着只有特殊需求的制品，有的产品的实际需求数量很少，有的则是复杂精巧的特种手工艺品等。所谓地方企业大部分都属于这一类。还有像化学玩具或圣诞节用的装饰品等，由大企业投下固定资本进行生产，不如由中小企业用手工业方式利用女工、童工的低廉劳动来生产，因为这样产品成本可以更便宜些，所以大企业根本就不向这些部门插手。
    但是，大部分独立经营的中小企业在生产领域内却处于同大企业进行直接竞争的地位上。在棉织业、毛织业、自行车、缝纫机、照像机、各种医药品工业、化学药品工业或煤炭工业等几乎所有业种方面，都有这种情形。在自行车、缝纫机、照像机等生产领域内可以看到的特点是：在大企业，各种零件都是采取流水作业方式生产出来的，而在中小企业里，大多是从外面买来全部零件而仅仅进行装配。
    带有从属性质的中小企业中，有以家庭手工业为基础的从属于包销商户的工业（如各种地方性的纺织业、日用品、玩具业等），有以工场手工业为基础的新型的从属于包销商户的工业（机械器具、金属制品、纤维制品占多数），除了这些从属于商业资本的中小企业以外，还有以直接承包的形式从属于工业资本的中小企业。
    中小企业，同大企业处于直接竞争地位上的固不用说，就连具有独自生产领域的中小企业，也不断遭受到垄断资本的压迫和剥削，经常濒于没落的危机。中小企业受到垄断资本的压迫，经常把损失转嫁到工人身上；尽管如此，还是有许多中小企业因维持不了而倒闭。
    垄断资本有着榨取中小企业的强有力的手段。垄断价格、控制原料、控制金融、通过国家机构课以重税等等是它们的主要方法。在垄断资本控制下的日本，中小企业很少有不受垄断价格的影响的。重化学工业固不必说，在轻工业中，除了供直接消费的最后的成品以外的部门，也几乎完全被垄断资本所控制。抬高国内价格，降低输出价格，强行海外倾销，以便在海外市场上取得竞争的胜利，是日本垄断资本的传统政策。现在公开被认可的卡特尔有：铜块、铜丝、钢铁、水泥、硬质陶器、高级纸张、硫安、甘油、油漆、麻织品、棉织品、化学纤维、轴承、煤等等，此外还有不顾垄断禁止法的所谓“秘密卡特尔”，事实上控制着垄断资本所控制的整个产业部门。
    最近，在日本经济迅速发展当中，由于日本的物价比国际市场价格高，垄断资本采取了加强所谓“繁荣企业卡特尔”，保障垄断资本方面获得价格比较低廉的物资，同时强制中小企业购买市场上的高价物资的政策。
    在原料非常缺乏的情况下，中小企业不仅要付出高价去购买原料，甚至根本买不到原料。
    垄断资本在金融方面，也给与中小企业以很重的压迫。银行对中小企业的小额贷款，以钱数少为理由，而要求付出比贷给大企业的贷款更高的利息。此外，银行并且以对中小企业放款有较大的危险性为理由，普通都是强制要求把中小企业的借款的一部分存放在银行里，并且借款人必须按照原来的借款额支付利息。因此，中小企业实际担负的利息比实际借到的款项的利息要高得多。不仅如此，银行并且把这笔扣留下来的存款拨给大企业，使大企业得到优待。本来普通银行之外，还有专对中小企业放款的特殊金融机关。如相互银行、中小企业金融公库、商工工会中央金库、国民金融公库、信用金库等等。但这些机关的资本少，放款数量有限，因而不能满足中小企业的需要。
    垄断资本的大企业，根据“租税临时特别措施法”，折旧和红利的分配等都享有免税的特惠权，可是中小企业不仅享受不到这种免税的特惠权，税金负担反而比战前更重。拿以中小企业为主要对象的个人营业税来说，战前（1934——1936年）所得税的负担率不超过所得的1.3％，战后却增长到7.3％乃至7.8％。
    垄断资本除了用这些方法压榨中小企业以外，更打进了中小企业独自的生产领域，这是战后新的特征。去年春季以来，大电机制造业向家庭用电气器具生产方面的进攻，钢铁垄断企业对于薄铁板生产的垄断趋势，纺织业的大资本家之打进纤维加工制品的生产，大制油公司之打进棉籽油的生产，都是很显著的、过去所没有的现象。垄断资本通过这种办法，把中小企业纳入它的系统，加强了承包生产的从属关系。虽然这种把中小企业纳入垄断资本系统的过程，由于各企业情况不同，表现出多种多样的形态，但是在加强榨取低廉劳动力这一点上则是相同的。大企业和中小企业的工资差额也越来越大，据日本劳动省的调查，以五百人以上的大企业的工资为一百，三十人至一百人的中小企业的工资1950年为67.3％，1951年为61.8％，1952年为58.8％，1953年为60％，1954年为60.1％，1955年为59.7％。
    日本的中小企业在垄断资本的榨取和掠夺政策之下，艰难地维持经营。它们是极零散的，互相间有利害矛盾，团结力量很弱，因而对垄断资本的政策也不能采取有效的对抗手段。只要还有广大的失业后备军和相对的人口过剩的压迫，中小企业即使被挤垮，也会有新的中小企业继续产生，并且被纳入垄断资本榨取的罗网。对于垄断资本来说，中小企业是竞争对手，同时也是不可缺少的榨取超额利润的对象。
    日本的中小企业为了生存下去，或者站在没落的危机的边缘上继续维持现状；或者加强中小企业之间的团结，并同工人阶级携起手来，反对共同的敌人——垄断资本，以求得稳定的经营，这就是日本中小企业面临的抉择。
