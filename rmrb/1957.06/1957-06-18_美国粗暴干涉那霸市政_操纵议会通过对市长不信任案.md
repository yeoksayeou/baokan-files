　　U.S. Rudely Interferes in Naha Municipal Affairs
　　Manipulates Assembly to Pass Vote of No Confidence in Mayor
    Xinhua News Agency, Naha, 17th: The Naha City Assembly, the capital of Okinawa Island, today passed a vote of no confidence in Naha Mayor Kamejiro Senaga, leader of the People's Party.
    Because the People's Party implements a policy of firmly opposing the continued occupation of Okinawa by the U.S. military, the people of Naha elected this secretary-general of the People's Party as mayor on December 25th of last year. After Senaga took office, the U.S. military authorities froze all of the Naha municipal government's deposits and instigated local forces in Naha to oppose Senaga in an attempt to force him to step down.
    Because the Naha City Assembly finally passed the vote of no confidence under U.S. manipulation, Senaga may resign or the city assembly may be re-elected. In the current city assembly, conservative forces account for about three-quarters.

　　美国粗暴干涉那霸市政
　　操纵议会通过对市长不信任案
    据新华社17日讯　那霸消息：冲绳岛首府那霸市议会今天通过了对人民党领袖、那霸市长濑长龟次郎的不信任案。
    由于人民党实行坚决反对美军继续占领冲绳的政策，那霸人民在去年12月25日把这位人民党书记长选出来做市长。濑长就任以后，美军当局就冻结了那霸市政府的全部存款，并且唆使那霸的地方势力反对濑长，力图赶他下台。
    由于那霸市议会终于在美国操纵下通过了不信任案，濑长或将辞职，或者改选市议会。在目前的市议会中，保守势力约占四分之三。
