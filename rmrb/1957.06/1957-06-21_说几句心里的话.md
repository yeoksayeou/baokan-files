During this period of great "blooming and contending," when everyone is helping the Communist Party with rectification, I have not spoken much due to poor health. However, after reading the speeches in the newspapers of ministers, editors-in-chief of daily newspapers, capitalists, and lecturers at Renmin University, I feel quite indignant. These people have rich experience, have undergone long-term study, should have a considerable understanding of social politics, and should have a fervent love for China. Why would they utter such fallacies, insist on fixed interest for twenty years, say that fixed interest is unearned income rather than exploitation, and say things like "Party-controlled world," "people's living standards have not improved," "the masses want to kill the Communist Party," and "if the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse," which are completely inconsistent with theory and fact? There must be a reason for this.

I don't want to say good things for the Chinese Communist Party; the Chinese Communist Party doesn't need me to list its achievements. I only ask whether we have recognized right and wrong, whether we love the country. Let me first mention the issue of "rehabilitation" and talk about my own experience. I suffered during the Three-Anti Campaign and felt unspeakable bitterness. But I don't want rehabilitation because what I suffered was the best and most effective education for an old person, a person whose thinking is not easily changed. During the Three-Anti Campaign, our country was still in the process of revolution; the people should thoroughly understand what position an intellectual, who has always worked with imperialist elements, is standing on; whether he is on the side of the people or acting as an agent of imperialism. It is not easy to clarify this issue. But in my experience, the Party members who contacted me treated me in accordance with the principle of curing the sickness to save the patient. There were deviations, there were excesses; but on the whole, the result was fair. As far as I know, there are many others who have had similar experiences. If, due to experiencing deviations and suffering blows, regardless of the education received and the actual benefits gained, one simply harbors resentment and thinks of revenge, that is truly a narrow-mindedness that only sees the small and not the big, and that is truly a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of revolution. As for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, there may have been wrongful arrests and killings, but looking at the issue comprehensively, the CCP sincerely loves the people and serves the people, and is very lenient and extremely tolerant.

I don't want to say many things. Simply put, demanding that the state pay capitalists fixed interest for twenty years places obstacles on the road to socialism and does not recognize that capitalists are an exploiting class. This is extremely harmful to the development and progress of the country. Related to this is the idea that fixed interest is unearned income. Many people have already pointed out that unearned income is exploitation.

There is absolutely no such thing as unearned income in economic life. The capitalists' attempt to come up with this kind of statement in their reactionary essence naturally cannot deceive the working class because they have personally experienced exploitation and tasted the bitterness of exploitation. However, the state actually stipulates the payment of fixed interest, with a term of seven years, and after seven years, it can still be dragged on. This is the utmost care for the capitalists, this is allowing the capitalists ample time to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers. Why do capitalists who have already studied for a period of time and are in the process of becoming laborers not fully understand this meaning? What good is paying twenty years of fixed interest to the capitalists who are currently undergoing transformation? What good is it to our country?

I originally thought that loving the country was an easy thing; now I think that loving the country may not be easy for some people. The country comes first, and personal interests are secondary and then even less important. Who doesn't know this? At the critical moment, some people show their true colors. Ge Peiqi said, "If the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse." Chu Anping said that the world is "Party-controlled." If people don't see profit and forget righteousness, how could these words come out of their mouths? Please recall 1931 to 1945, and then recall 1945 to 1949. The Japanese devils swallowed a large part of China, and Chiang Kai-shek made fighting the Communist Party the first priority and fighting the Japanese devils the second priority. Without the Communist Party, could China have achieved independence and self-preservation? After the victory, American imperialism used the Chiang regime to control China, making China an appendage of the United States in economic, political, and cultural terms. Without the Communist Party, could China have broken free from its shackles and achieved independence and self-preservation? China expelled imperialism, eliminated feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, formed a worker-peasant alliance, and recently a worker-peasant-intellectual alliance. The country is being built at a rapid pace. Who is leading this? The Communist Party has shortcomings and makes mistakes. It knows this best and most clearly, so it wants rectification, so it wants everyone to provide benevolent help to eliminate the subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism that hinder its progress. But regardless of whether these three evils are completely eliminated or not, the CCP must lead China. Since ancient times, no organization or party has been able to lead China to such a strong, consolidated, and hopeful state. The survival of China depends entirely on whether it is led by the Chinese Communist Party. A person who loves the country does not want China to perish, and is determined that China should exist, be prosperous, strong, independent, and free, and naturally wants the Communist Party to fully maintain its leadership. Today, if someone says that if the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse, is there still any patriotism left? If the Communist Party does not lead, then the various parties will naturally divide the leadership equally. Won't the situation be the same as it was ten years ago? In today's international situation, will China not perish?

I wonder if those who advocate "Party-controlled world" are ambitiously trying to make the democratic parties share the world equally with the Chinese Communist Party. I don't think the Party wants to, nor has it ever monopolized the world. Because China belongs to the 600 million people. The Party is the leader of the 600 million people, and the 600 million people only believe in the Communist Party and are only willing to be led by the Communist Party. At the same time, the Party has not excluded non-Party members from participating in leadership under its leadership. The ministers, editors-in-chief of daily newspapers, and lecturers at Renmin University who made fallacies are themselves clear evidence of this. But because the Communist Party led the people, the working and peasant classes, and achieved revolutionary victory, liberating everyone from unspeakable suffering, poverty, oppression, and exploitation, and has always served the people and sought the people's welfare, laying a solid and independent foundation for the country, it has gained the trust of the whole country, and has gained leadership through trust. Ask the people of the whole country, the working and peasant classes of the whole country, and the awakened intellectuals of the whole country, whether they are willing to let other parties share the world equally with the Chinese Communist Party and take turns governing. I don't know what attitude the people now have towards other parties. In my own view, I think it is most reasonable, most appropriate, and most beneficial to the country to place myself under the leadership of the Communist Party, even though the Chinese Communist Party also makes mistakes. All the policies led by the Communist Party have always been correct and wise. Of course, its leadership is unshakable; a mayfly trying to shake a big tree only shows its own arrogance. But now there are people who want to be mayflies, ambitiously wanting to make the illusion of divide and rule, wanting to take turns governing, being ignorant of the domestic situation and unaware of the international situation, indulging in fantasy, which is really unbelievable. I heard people say that if China does not allow those ambitious right-leaning elements, or even reactionary elements, to share some leadership, the events of Hungary in October of last year will be re-enacted in China. This is really nonsense. The entire Chinese people are patriotic, and no one can shake the foundation that China has already laid.

Today, China is a unified and united country; this is an unprecedented fact. This unity and solidarity is not only a geographical fact, but also a fact in the lives and psychology of the people of the whole country. Although there are contradictions within various people's organizations, they are already united. Although there may still be estrangement between ethnic minorities and the Han people, and between ethnic minorities themselves, the unity between them can no longer be broken. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country are even more united, flesh and blood. This is China's greatest and most valuable strength.

Without such unity, would we still not be the fish and meat under the butcher's knife of imperialism and colonialism today? Would we still be able to hold our heads high in the world and proudly be the masters of our own country? This fact is already obvious. Why would anyone disregard the interests of the country and want to share leadership with the Communist Party?

Wouldn't sharing leadership divide China? Wouldn't it destroy the unprecedented unity and solidarity? Wouldn't it endanger China's national destiny? Therefore, I cannot but say that anyone who loves the country will never utter the fallacies of "Party-controlled world" and "If the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse."

China is determined to take the socialist road. Anyone who wants to take another road is a dangerous element harming the country. And the goal of socialism cannot be achieved immediately in the short term. The ideas of "unearned income" and "fixed interest for twenty years" will not only delay the time it takes us to reach the goal of socialism, but may also shift our direction and prolong the life of capitalist remnants. This is absolutely detrimental to China. In the process of taking the socialist road, the people's living standards are gradually improving. To deny this fact is to be heartless. Workers, peasants, and the masses have long pointed this out. But in the development of socialism, the living standards of some people have indeed been lowered somewhat. If one's own living standards are slightly lowered, and one says that the people's living standards have not improved, then that is lying, that is spreading rumors. Regarding the lowering of the living standards of some people, I have experience; because I used to be a professor at a university, living in comfort, and life was indeed much more comfortable than it is now. Now that I am old, it is not easy to register for medical treatment in the hospital; to get a haircut, one has to wait patiently in the barbershop; to eat meat, one has to queue in front of the butcher's shop, and one may not even be able to buy meat; to repair shoes and make clothes, one has to wait patiently for a long time; to take a bus, one has to squeeze hard with the masses. I often joke with my family, "I love socialism, but today, with the rise of socialism, it is really too inconvenient for me." But I still happily look forward to the success of socialism. Because the fact of queuing shows that now everyone can get medical treatment and everyone can eat meat. It is only right and proper that I am subjected to some restrictions. Those who plant the trees do not have to eat the fruit; their descendants will naturally be able to enjoy the benefits of eating the fruit. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the masses are all working hard, not only for today, but also for a better and happier future. China can only take the socialist road, and as I see it, the whole world can only take the socialist road, before humanity can truly have hope. Don't say that the people's living standards have already improved today, even if the improvement is not much, it doesn't matter. To make sure that 600 million people all have food, clothing, and shelter—this is already being done—is such an arduous and great undertaking. Mr. Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at Renmin University, and especially one who teaches economics, should know this.

Furthermore, not long ago, we studied "Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." The dictatorship of the proletariat is such an important matter. To take the socialist road and hope to move from socialism to communism, it is impossible without the dictatorship of the proletariat. I am a religious person, and also a non-Party person, and I have not carefully studied Marxism-Leninism. But I know that only the dictatorship of the proletariat and the international solidarity of the proletariat can overcome all the subversive activities of imperialism and colonialism, and all the cruel aggressions aimed at destroying us. Even if not for anything else, just for the sake of our country's independence and prosperity, a person who loves the country cannot but support the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is full of internationalism. The dictatorship of the proletariat is aimed at the bourgeoisie, aimed at all capitalism and the remnants of capitalism. And only the Communist Party can lead and realize this dictatorship because the Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. Which other political party can replace the Communist Party in this extremely important cause? Therefore, the statements of "Party-controlled world" and "If the Communist Party collapses, China will not collapse" are absurd, and are ideas that harm the country and harm the people. China's international status today already has a pivotal force, and China's international prestige is increasing day by day. We can say a fair and truthful word, which is: with the leadership of the Communist Party, we all have our world, with the leadership of the Communist Party, we can stand tall in the world, and all the vicious, oppressive, exploitative, and murderous forces cannot shake us in the slightest.

The Communist Party wants us to help it with rectification, and we naturally have to work hard. Now I also feel that the subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism in the Party have undergone serious development and spread. Regarding this point, the Communist Party itself is most clear and most aware, and it wants to get criticism and accusations from non-Party members. Observing from the perspective of the Christian community, I feel that the Party has a very good religious policy, but it has not been adequately publicized and seriously implemented. For example, in the Wenlin area of Zhejiang, and in Hunan and Anhui provinces, many rural churches are still not allowed to open their doors and are not allowed to hold worship services. The religious people have urgent needs, but the local governments that serve the people only push the responsibility from higher levels to lower levels, and from lower levels to higher levels, like playing a football game. The reason for this is that the three evils of subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism are hindering progress there. I believe that after the rectification, these three evils can definitely be reduced to a minimum. And rectification is to strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party, to enable us to take the socialist road more quickly and more steadily, to enable us to sweep away all reactionary fallacies, and to build our country with more confidence and increase the happiness of our people.

### 说几句心里的话

　　说几句心里的话
　　燕京协和神学院研究教授　赵紫宸
    在这大“鸣”大“放”，大家帮助共产党整风的时期，我因身体不好没有说什么话。但是在报纸上读到一班做部长的，做日报主编的，做资本家的，做人民大学讲师的人发表的言论，心中颇觉不平。这些人都是有丰富经验的，有过长期学习的，对于社会政治应该有相当了解的，对于中国也应该是热烈爱护的。为什么他们竟会大放谬论，竟会要定息二十年，说定息是不劳而获而不是剥削，说什么党天下、人民生活水平没有提高、群众要杀共产党、共产党亡了中国也不会亡，等等完全不合理论，又不合事实的话呢？其中定有缘故。
    我并不要为中国共产党说好话；中国共产党也不需要我列举他的功绩。我只问我们认清了是非没有，我们爱国不爱国。让我先提一提“平反”这个问题，说一说我自己的经验。我是在三反中吃过苦的，而且觉得苦不胜言。但是我不要平反，因为我所受的是对于一个年老的人，一个思想不容易改变的人，最好的最有效的教育。当三反的时候，我们国家还在革命的过程中；人民应该要彻底知道一个知识分子，素来与帝国主义分子共事的，究竟站在什么立场之上；究竟是在人民方面呢，还是在做帝国主义的代理人。把这个问题弄清楚是不容易的。但是在我经验中，与我接触的党员都本着治病救人的原则来与我相交的。偏差是有的，过火也是有的；但是总起来说结果是公道的。据我所知道与我经验相同的不在少数。若因经历偏差，受过打击，不问所受的教育如何，所得的实益如何，只是怀恨在心，思想报复，那实在是只见其小，不见其大的狭窄心怀，那实在是完全不明白革命的意义。至于镇压反革命，肃清反革命，误捉误杀，也可能有的，但是从全面来看问题，中共是真心爱人民，服务人民的，是十分宽大的，极其包容的。
    我不想说许多事，简单地说，要国家付资本家二十年定息是把障碍放在社会主义道路上，是不承认资本家是剥削阶级。这对于国家的发展与进步有极大的害处。与这相连的是定息是不劳而获的想法，已经有许多人指出过不劳而获就是剥削。
    经济生活上决没有不劳而获这个事实。资本家在反动的本质上想出这种言论来自然瞒不过工人阶级，因为他们是身受剥削，备尝剥削的滋味的。然而国家竟规定发付定息，七年为期，七年之后，还可以拖一个尾巴。这是照顾资本家无微不至的至意，这是让资本家有充分的工夫改造自己成为自食其力的劳动者。已经学习过一个时期的，正在变为劳动者的资本家为什么竟会完全不明白这个意思呢？付二十年定息，对于现在在转变中的资本家究竟有什么好处呢？对于我们的国家又究竟有什么好处呢？
    我本来想爱国是一件容易的事情；现在想想倒觉对于一些人爱国是未必容易的。国家第一，个人的利益本其次而又其次，谁不知这个呢？到了紧要关头，有些人显出了他们的狐狸尾巴。葛佩琦说“共产党亡了，中国也不会亡。”储安平说天下是“党天下”。人若不见利忘义，这些话怎能从嘴里说出来。请回想一下1931年到1945年，再回想一下1945年到1949年。日本鬼子吞了中国的一大部分，蒋介石以打共产党为第一件事，打日本鬼子为第二件事。试问没有共产党中国能独立自存么？胜利之后，美帝国主义利用了蒋政权来制服中国，使中国在经济政治文化上做美国的尾巴。试问没有共产党，中国能够摆脱枷锁独立自存么？中国驱逐了帝国主义，消灭了封建主义，官僚资本主义，组成了工农联盟，最近又有了工农与知识分子的联盟，国家在突飞猛进中建设起来，究竟是谁领导的呢？共产党有缺点，犯错误，它自己最知道，最明白，所以要整风，所以要大家善意地给予帮助，使他消除阻碍它前进的主观主义，宗派主义与官僚主义。但是无论这三害完全除得掉与否，中共是必须领导中国的。从古以来，没有一个团体一个党能够领导中国到这样强大巩固，满有希望的地步。中国的存亡全在于是否由中国共产党领导。爱国的人决不愿中国亡，决定要中国存在而且富强独立自由，自然也就愿意由共产党完全保持领导权。在今日，若说共产党亡了，中国也不会亡的，果然还有一点爱国心么？共产党不领导，当然由各党派平分领导，情形不会像十年以前一样么？在今日的国际情势之下，中国会不亡么？
    倡言“党天下”的是不是野心勃勃要使民主党派与中国共产党平分天下，我以为党并不要，也并不曾独占天下。因为中国是六亿人民的天下。党是六亿人民的领导人，而六亿人民也只相信共产党，只肯受共产党的领导。同时党并没有排斥党外人士在它领导之下，参加领导，那些发表谬论的部长们，日报主编，人民大学讲师自身就是这一点明显的凭据。但是因为共产党领导人民群众，工农阶级，取得了革命的胜利，使大家从不可言喻的痛苦，贫穷，被压迫，被剥削的生活中解放出来，从来一贯地服务人民，谋人民的福利，把国家奠定巩固独立的基础之上，所以它得到了全国的信任，由信任而得到了领导权。请问问全国的人民群众，全国的工农阶级，全国觉醒的知识分子，他们肯不肯让别的党派与中国共产党平分天下，轮流执政。人民现在对于别的党派持着什么态度我不知道。就我自己的看法，我觉得中国共产党虽然也要犯错误，总是把自己放在共产党的领导之下为最合理，最为妥当，最为于国家有利。由共产党所领导的一切政策从来是正确的，英明的。当然它的领导权是摇不动的；蜉蝣撼大树，多见其不自量。但是现在竟有人会想做蜉蝣，野心勃勃，要作分而治之的幻想，要轮流执政，既昧于国内的情势，又不察乎国际的局面，异想天开，真是匪夷所思。听人说中国若不让那些野心勃勃的右倾分子，甚至于反动分子分享些领导权，匈牙利去年十月的事件会在中国再演出来的。这真是胡说。中国全体人民是爱国的，谁都不能摇动了中国已经奠定的根基。
    今日中国是一个统一团结的国家；这是一个史无前例的事实。这个统一与团结不仅是地理上的事实，也是全国人民生活上、心理上的事实。各人民团体内部虽有矛盾，却已经是团结的。少数民族与汉族，少数民族彼此之间，虽或未免还有隔膜，但他们之间的团结是再也不能打破的。共产党与全国人民更是团结一致，血肉相连。这就是中国最大最可贵的力量。
    没有这样的团结，我们今天还能不做帝国主义、殖民主义刀俎之下的鱼肉么？还能在全世界上举起头来、自傲地作自己国家的主人翁么？这个事实已经明显不过。而为什么还会有人弃置国家的利益于不顾而想要与共产党分得领导权呢？
    分领导权不是会使中国分裂么？不是会破坏史无前例的统一与团结么？不是会危害中国的国命么？所以我不能不说凡是爱国的人决不发“党天下”，“共产党亡了，中国也不会亡”的谬论。
    中国是走定了社会主义道路的，谁要想走另一条路，谁就是危害国家的危险分子。而社会主义的目标不能短时期内立刻就达到。“不劳而获”、“定息二十年”的想法不但会延迟我们达到社会主义目的的时日，而且发展起来可能转移我们的定向，可能延长资本主义残余的寿命。这于中国是绝对不利的。在走社会主义道路的当际，人民的生活水平已经在逐渐提高。否认这个事实便是没有心肝。工人农民以及人民群众早已说明了这一点。但是在社会主义发展之中，有些人的生活享受的确是降低了一些。自己的生活稍微降低了一些，就说人民的生活水平没有提高，那就是说谎，就是造谣。论到有些人生活享受降低，我是有经验的；因为我从前在大学里当教授，养尊处优，生活果然比现在舒服得多。现在我年老的时候，要看病在医院里挂号不容易；要理发在理发馆里要耐心等待；要吃肉要在肉铺面前排队，而且不定买得到肉；要修补皮鞋，定做衣服，要耐着性久待；要坐车只好与人民大众去用力挨挤。我常对家里的人说笑话，“我是热爱社会主义的，而今日社会主义冒起头来，于我实在太不方便。”但是我还是欢欢喜喜地盼望着社会主义的成功。因为排队的事实就是表明，现在人人可以得医治，人人可以吃肉。我受一点限制，本是理所当然。栽树的人不必吃果子，子孙自能得到吃果子的好处。工人农民知识分子人民大众都在辛辛苦苦地工作，为的不但是今天，而且是更好更幸福的将来。中国只有走社会主义的道路，据我看全世界也只有走社会主义的道路，人类才真的有希望。不要说今天人民的水平已经有了提高，就是说提高得不多，也没有关系。要使六亿人口人人有吃有穿有住——这是已经做到的——是何等艰巨的伟业。人民大学的讲师，而且是讲经济学的葛佩琦先生似乎应该晓得这一点。
    再者，不久以前我们学习“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”。无产阶级专政是何等重要的事情。要走社会主义的路，又要盼望着从社会主义走到共产主义，没有无产阶级专政是不可能的。我是宗教界人士，也是无党无派人士，没有细心地研究过马列主义。但我知道只有无产阶级专政与无产阶级的国际团结才能胜过帝国主义殖民主义的一切颠复活动，一切残酷的、志在消灭我们的侵略。即不为别的，只为了我们国家的独立富强，一个爱国的人，就不能不拥护满有国际主义的无产阶级的专政。无产阶级的专政是针对着资产阶级的，是针对着一切资本主义以及资本主义的残余的。而这个专政只有共产党能领导能实现，因为共产党是无产阶级的先锋队。别的政党，那一个能在这一个极端重要的事业上取共产党而代之。因此“党天下”，“共产党亡了，中国也不会亡”的说法是荒谬绝伦的、危害国家、危害人民的思想。中国今日的国际地位已经有举足轻重的力量，中国今日的国际威信是与日俱增的。我们可以说一句公道话，真实话，就是：有共产党的领导我们大家才有我们的天下，有共产党的领导，我们才能昂然立足于世界之上，一切凶恶的、压迫人的、剥削人的、杀害人的势力才不能丝毫摇动我们。
    共产党要我们帮助它整风，我们自然要努力。到了现在我也感觉得党里的主观主义宗派主义官僚主义有了严重的发展与蔓延。对于这一点，共产党自己最清楚最明白，它要得到党外人士的批评与指摘。我从基督教界里的角度观察，觉得党有很好的宗教政策，而没有充分的宣传，认真的贯彻。例如浙江温林一带，湖南安徽各省，有许多乡下教堂还不许开门，不许举行礼拜。信教的人民有急切的需要而服务人民的地方政府只是上级推下级，下级推上级，好像玩足球的把戏。察其原因就是主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义这三害在那里作梗。我相信经过整风，这个三害一定可以减少到最小的限度。而整风是加强共产党的领导，叫我们更迅速地、更稳步地走社会主义的道路，叫我们扫清一切反动的谬论，更有信心地建设我们的国家，增进我们人民的幸福。
