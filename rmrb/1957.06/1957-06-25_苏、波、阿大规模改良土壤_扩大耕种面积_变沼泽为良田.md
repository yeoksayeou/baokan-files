Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet Union is carrying out large-scale drainage and soil improvement work. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1956-1960), it is planned to drain waterlogged land and begin sowing on 3.1 million hectares.

Swamps and low-lying wetlands account for about one-tenth of the Soviet Union's territory. Currently, the area where soil improvement is being carried out in the low-lying forest zone alone is the size of four Belgiums. The area of deep mossy swamps in this region is about 2 million hectares.

In the post-war years, 450,000 hectares of low-lying forest swamps in the Soviet Union have been transformed into well-drained fertile fields. In the next four years, another 400,000 hectares of low-lying forest swamps will be converted into arable land.

The Baltic coastal republics are currently carrying out large-scale soil improvement work. For centuries, only 2 million hectares of land had been drained along the Baltic coast, but during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, more than 1.5 million hectares of swamps will be turned into fertile fields. This year, Latvia will drain 65,000 hectares of swamps, which is 10,000 hectares more than the total area drained during the twenty years under bourgeois rule.

A wide soil improvement network is also being built between the Ob and Irtysh rivers in Siberia. Here is a large area of the famous Baraba Lowland, with an area of nearly 12 million hectares. One-third of this lowland is swamp. The length of drainage ditches in this swamp area has now reached 20,000 kilometers. Grain and feed crops can be harvested well on the drained Baraba land. The Baraba Lowland will become one of the Soviet Union's major livestock centers.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 24th: Polish farmers are carrying out various soil improvement works on approximately 70,000 hectares of arable land and 80,000 hectares of pastures this year. More than 120,000 hectares of land that has already undergone soil improvement in the past few years will be reused.

In coastal areas, farmers have drained water from large areas of lakes and swamps, turning many swamps into farmland and pastures. In addition, the work of repairing and reinforcing canals and flood control equipment is also proceeding intensely. In Zielona Góra Province alone, more than 10,000 farmers are carrying out soil and water conservation work on 140,000 hectares of arable land and pastures.

Since the beginning of this year, the production enthusiasm of Polish farmers has increased significantly. Experts from the Polish Ministry of Agriculture have pointed out that approximately 100 hectares of previously abandoned land have been replanted, and the phenomenon of abandoned land can basically be eliminated this year. It is believed that the large-scale development of soil improvement and farmland irrigation projects is one of the new phenomena that has recently emerged in the Polish countryside.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: The Albanian Council of Ministers has announced a resolution to carry out a major soil improvement project in the Vurgu and Murrsi plains in southern Albania. This project will be completed in 1960.

These two plains have fertile soil and climatic conditions suitable for the growth of crops and fruit trees. However, due to the constant flooding of rivers flowing through the plains, only a portion of the land can be utilized. Carrying out this project will make full use of the land in these two plains. By the time the project is completed, 4,600 hectares of land will be improved, 6,700 hectares of land will be irrigated, and more than 2,300 hectares of new fertile land will be added.

The project plan stipulates that reservoirs, sluice gates will be built and drainage and irrigation canals will be dug, and forest belts will also be built to achieve the purpose of storing water and conserving soil.

　　苏、波、阿大规模改良土壤
    扩大耕种面积　变沼泽为良田
    新华社讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联正在大规模地进行排水和土壤改良工作。预定在第六个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）排干积水并且开始播种的土地将达到三百一十万公顷。
    沼泽地区和低湿泥地约占苏联领土的十分之一。目前单是在低洼丛林地带进行土壤改良的地区面积就有四个比利时那么大。这个地区长满藓苔的深沼泽的面积约占两百万公顷。
    战后年代中苏联有四十五万公顷的低洼丛林沼泽被改造成了无积水的良田。在最近四年内还要有四十万公顷的低洼丛林沼泽地带变为耕地。
    波罗的海沿岸各共和国目前都在进行大规模的土壤改良工作。许多世纪以来在波罗的海沿岸排干了的土地只有两百万公顷，而在第六个五年计划期间就要有一百五十多万公顷的沼泽变成良田。今年拉脱维亚将排干六万五千公顷沼泽，比它在资产阶级统治下二十年期间排干的沼泽的总面积还多一万公顷。
    西伯利亚鄂毕河和额尔齐斯河之间也在建设着广泛的土壤改良网。这里有一大片著名的巴拉巴低地，面积差不多有一千二百万公顷。这块低地有三分之一是沼泽。这个沼泽区排水渠长度目前已达两万公里。在排干了的巴拉巴土地上，谷物和饲料作物都能获得很好的收成。巴拉巴低地将成为苏联畜牧业巨大中心之一。
    新华社华沙24日电　波兰农民今年在约七万公顷耕地和八万公顷牧场上进行各种土壤改良工作。过去几年已经进行了土壤改良的十二万多公顷土地将重新使用。
    在沿海地区，农民从大块的湖沼地带排出了积水，把许多沼泽变作了农田和牧场。此外，修理、加固渠道和防水设备的工作也正在紧张地进行。单在绿山省，就有一万多户农民在十四万公顷耕地和牧场上进行水土保持的工作。
    今年以来，波兰农民的生产积极性有了显著的提高。波兰农业部的专家曾经指出，过去荒废的约一百公顷土地大都被重新耕种了，今年基本上可以消灭荒废土地的现象。人们认为，土壤改良和农田水利工作的大规模开展，是波兰农村最近出现的新景象之一。
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议公布一项决议，决定在阿尔巴尼亚南部的武尔古和穆尔西两个平原上进行一项改良土壤的巨大工程。这一工程将在1960年完成。
    这两个平原有着肥沃的土壤和适于农作物和果树生长的气候条件。但是由于流经平原的河流不断泛滥成灾，只有一部分土地可以利用。进行这一工程将使这两个平原的土地得到充分利用。到工程完成的时候，将有四千六百公顷土地得到改良，六千七百公顷土地获得灌溉，并且还将增加二千三百多公顷新的肥沃土地。
    工程的计划规定将兴建水库闸门和开凿排水渠、灌溉渠，并且还将建造森林带，以达到蓄水保土的目的。
