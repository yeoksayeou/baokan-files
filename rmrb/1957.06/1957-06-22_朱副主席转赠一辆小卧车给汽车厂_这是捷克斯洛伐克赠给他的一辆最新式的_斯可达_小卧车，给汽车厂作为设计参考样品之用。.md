Vice Chairman Zhu Donates a Sedan to the Automobile Factory
	This is a state-of-the-art "Skoda" sedan given to him by Czechoslovakia, to be used by the automobile factory as a design reference sample.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 21st - Vice Chairman Zhu De recently presented a brand-new "Skoda" sedan, a gift from Czechoslovakia, to the First Automobile Works, for use as a reference sample for the factory's small car design.
    On the day the cream-colored sedan was driven into the factory's trial production workshop, it was immediately surrounded by design and trial production personnel. Some were busy opening the engine hood, while others discussed its beautiful appearance and structure. Some were also observing the arrangement of its electrical circuits. People said excitedly, "The national leaders are so concerned about the development of our country's automobile industry!"
    According to the automobile factory staff, another French "Simca" sedan, sent by the State Technology Commission, arrived at the same time as this Skoda. The automobile factory's designers have decided to begin a series of structural and performance tests on these two sedans, as well as on small cars from many countries, next month, in order to absorb the advantages from various aspects and design a new type of small car with a unique style made in our own country.

　　朱副主席转赠一辆小卧车给汽车厂
    这是捷克斯洛伐克赠给他的一辆最新式的“斯可达”小卧车，给汽车厂作为设计参考样品之用。
    新华社长春21日电　朱德副主席最近把捷克斯洛伐克赠给他的一辆最新的“斯可达”小卧车，送给了第一汽车制造厂，作为这个厂设计小卧车的参考样品之用。
    这辆乳白色小卧车开进工厂试制车间的当天，就被设计和试制人员团团围住。他们有的在忙着打开发动机罩，有的谈论着它美观的外型和结构。也有的人在观察着它的电气线路的装置。人们兴奋地说：“国家领导人，对我国汽车工业的发展工作是多么关心啊！”
    据汽车厂的工作人员说，和这辆小卧车同时运来的还有由国家技术委员会送的另一辆法国“西母卡”小卧车。汽车厂的设计人员决定在下个月就开始对这两辆小卧车，以及许多国家的小汽车作一系列的结构、性能等试验，从多方面吸取优点，以便设计出我国自己制造的具有独特风格的新型小卧车。
