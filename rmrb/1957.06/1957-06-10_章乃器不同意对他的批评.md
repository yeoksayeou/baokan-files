    Zhang Naiqi Disagrees with Criticism of Him
    (Our Dispatch) Zhang Naiqi presented a written statement at a forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee for people in industrial and commercial circles, expressing his disagreement with the criticisms made against him. The full text of his written statement is as follows:
    Having read the reports of the forums held by the CPC Central Committee for people in industrial and commercial circles on June 6th and June 8th, I would like to express the following opinions:
    I. I feel that there are too many big labels such as "resisting transformation," "deviating from socialism," and "deviating from the leadership of the Party" being thrown around. This will only increase the concerns of those in industrial and commercial circles who are still hesitant to speak out freely. In fact, even with regard to Comrade Li Kangnian, who has received the most criticism, the intention of his suggestions is still to eliminate the bourgeoisie and remove the label of bourgeoisie as soon as possible; therefore, there is no reason to say that he wants to deviate from socialism, but only that he is too eager to pursue socialism and wants to remove the label without considering whether the conditions are mature. At the same time as removing the label, he also demands excessive compensation. When investigating the ideological roots through deduction, it should also be based on facts and strive for comprehensiveness; one should not seize on a part or a point and deduce it by leaps and bounds. In fact, the desire to remove the label as soon as possible is a common thought in industrial and commercial circles. Recalling before liberation, when we were working with industrialists and businessmen, as long as someone showed a slight sympathy for socialism, we cherished it like a precious gem and regarded it as a major victory in our work. Of course, times are different, and problems should be viewed in conjunction with the development of the situation. But to say that those who no longer want to be called capitalists are deviating from socialism is simply untenable. I think that as long as industrialists and businessmen are given equal citizenship treatment in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, they can be less anxious. This requires sincerely helping the Party to do a good job in the rectification campaign.
    II. It seems that, even now, many people have still not understood or have not fully understood the principles of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Among them, some people have not realized the strength of our Party and our country today, and are afraid that too much rectification will lead to collapse. These are people with good intentions, but it should also be explained to them clearly: we are not afraid of colds or flu. There are others who still have a sense of testing the Party's great principles, fearing that the surface is broad-minded but the inside is not so broad-minded, fearing that after "letting go," there will be a "tightening up," and when "tightening up," they will be rectified in reverse, so it is better to "keep three points in reserve" and "wait and see." These are more worldly-wise people, and they do not have enough trust in the Party's principles. There will also be a few people who take the opportunity to belittle others to elevate themselves in order to benefit themselves, showing a posture of "only I am loyal." The thoughts of such people are worth examining. It should be clear that, at present, the vast majority of people, over 90%, are loyal to accepting the leadership of the Party and loyal to the cause of socialism, and loyalty to accepting the leadership of the Party and loyalty to the cause of socialism is not a rare thing; when helping the Party to carry out the rectification campaign, as long as it is based on facts and starts from the desire for unity, it is perfectly acceptable to only mention shortcomings and not mention advantages, and this is normal; having worked with the Party for a long time, it is even more normal to speak honestly and "straight to the point" instead of starting with "supporting a few words." None of this can be said to be "deviating from socialism" or "deviating from leadership." Of course, it is also perfectly acceptable and normal to conduct counter-criticism of others' criticisms based on facts and starting from the desire for unity. It is absolutely impermissible to only allow negative comments and not allow positive comments. There is nothing wrong with labeling, as long as it is not done randomly.
    III. Comrade Sun Xiaocun said that I criticized "the United Front Work Department for participating in sectarian activities," which is not true. Please check the original text in the People's Daily on May 14th, I said, "Therefore, it once fostered some dictatorial work styles and patriarchal work styles. Naturally, it also fostered sectarian activities... It sometimes seems that the United Front Work Department is participating in sectarian activities. In fact, today, it is unlikely that sectarian activities can be carried out in the democratic parties without conspicuously or inconspicuously using the banner of the United Front Work Department." Saying "fostered," saying "it sometimes seems," saying "banner," how different is this from Comrade Sun Xiaocun's "participating in"? Is this intentionally opening one's eyes and lying, or is it forgetfulness? He also said that there are left, middle, and right distinctions within the China National Democratic Construction Association, and some people's views are more consistent with the Party's principles and policies, which is correct. But I want to ask again: After the Party put forward the principles of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," there are still people who organize "encirclement and suppression" of ideological issues, is this consistent with the Party's principles and policies? He also talked about whether key members participate in sectarian activities. My view is: key members generally do not participate in sectarian activities; key members participating in sectarian activities is caused by the sectarianism of the leaders.
    IV. Comrade Wu Dakun criticized me for distorting Stalin's statement that "Communists are made of special material." First of all, I disagree with his method. What impact this sentence will have on some Party members, I think we should look for it from objective reality. In this way, the reports in the newspapers during the rectification campaign have already presented a lot of material. Comrade Wu Dakun is just the opposite, he goes to Lenin's Selected Works to find the full text of Stalin's speech to discuss the issue. This is a standard dogmatic method. One should ask: Which is more widely distributed, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or Lenin's Selected Works? How many people can, like Comrade Wu Dakun, go to Lenin's Selected Works to find the basis when reading the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union? Naturally, even if the basis is found, it still cannot prove that Stalin's sentence is scientific. Comrade Wu Dakun also said: "Comrade Zhang Naiqi said that after 'passing five hurdles,' there is still a final hurdle of 'reborn' and 'flaying and skinning'." This is either opening one's eyes and lying, or it is forgetfulness. What I said was that it could be used by the enemy to carry out counter-propaganda, adding "flaying and skinning" after "reborn." Comrade Wu Dakun's debating style, is it upright or not, is worth considering.
    V. In addition, there are some "criticisms" similar to scolding, which I think are not worth arguing about; indeed, the masses are able to distinguish between good and evil. There are many theoretical issues, please criticize them after my "On the Dual Nature of the Chinese National Bourgeoisie" and "Several Issues Concerning Guidance Work for Industrial and Commercial Transformation" are published, and I will not answer them for the time being. Regarding my use of the title of Vice Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association in the articles published in "Industrial and Commercial Circles," I want to explain: I have never been willing to use any title when publishing articles, this time it was because of the request of the editors of "Industrial and Commercial Circles" that I agreed. I also had no reason to disagree, because I do have such a title. At the same time, using such a title does not mean that it represents any organization. Articles always express one's own personal opinions. Therefore, I also do not see that anyone has the right to prevent a person from using a title when publishing articles. I have no prejudice on this point, please legal scholars study it!
    VI. Finally, I would like to tell the industrial and commercial circles: the rectification movement must be carried out to the end; the Communist Party will never do things halfway. The Communist Party represents the honest and trustworthy qualities of the working class and will not do one thing on the surface and another thing in secret. We must completely believe in the Party's principles and policies, and use an honest and realistic attitude to expose contradictions and help the Party do a good job in the rectification work. Do not be afraid of being labeled, and even less afraid of being attacked. From some corners, the rectification movement will definitely have twists and turns, and there will definitely be over-"left" and over-"right" deviations, but the Party will distinguish between right and wrong. Right and wrong will definitely be clarified in the end.

专栏：

    章乃器不同意对他的批评
    本报讯　章乃器在中共中央统战部召开的工商界人士座谈会上提出书面发言，表示不同意别人对他的批评。他的书面发言全文如下：
    读了6月6日和6月8日中共中央召开的工商界人士座谈会的报道，我愿意发表如下的几点意见：
    一、我觉得“抵抗改造”、“离开社会主义”、“离开党的领导”……一类的大帽子多了一些。这样会使还不敢大放大鸣的工商界人士更加滋长了顾虑。实际上，即以受到批评最多的李康年同志来说，他的建议的用意仍然在于早点消灭资产阶级，摘掉资产阶级帽子；那就没有理由说他是要离开社会主义，而只能说他是过急地追求社会主义和不问条件是否成熟就想摘帽子。而摘帽子的同时，又要求过多的赎买金。用推论的方法追究思想根源，也应该实事求是，力求全面；不应抓住一部分或一点来推，而且一推就是十万八千里。实际上，要求早点摘帽子，是工商界普遍的思想。回想在解放以前，我们向工商业家做工作，只要有人稍稍表示同情社会主义，我们就珍若拱璧，视为工作的重大胜利。当然，时代是不同了，看问题应该结合形势的发展。但对于不愿意再被称为资本家的人反而说他是离开社会主义，那是无论如何都说不通的。我想，只要根据宪法规定，给工商业家以平等公民的待遇，他们是可以少安毋躁的。这就必须诚心诚意地帮助党做好整风工作。
    二、看来，直到现在，对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，仍然还有许多人没有想通或者没有完全想通。这中间，有一部分人是没有认识到今天我们的党和我们的国家的强大，怕整得太很就要整垮了。这些是好良心人，但也应该对他们说明白：我们不怕伤风、感冒。另有一部分人，他们对于党的伟大方针仍然存在着试探的意味，怕表面宽大、内里并不那么宽大，怕“放”了之后要“收”，“收”的时候要反过来整，因此，还是“保留三分”、“观望一下”为好。这些是世故较深的人，他们对党的方针是信任不够的。还会有少数人，是乘机用贬低别人来抬高自己的方法，以求对自己有利，表现了“唯我独忠”的姿态。这种人的思想就值得检查了。应该明确，在目前，忠诚接受党的领导和忠于社会主义事业的，是90％以上的大多数人，忠于接受党的领导和忠于社会主义事业，并不是什么希罕的事；在帮助党进行整风的时候，只要是根据事实，是从团结的愿望出发，完全可以不提优点、只提缺点，这是正常的；和党共事日久，说话不从“拥护一番”说起，而是老老实实“开门见山”地说，更是正常的。这都说不上什么“脱离社会主义”或者“脱离领导”。当然，也是根据事实，也是从团结的愿望出发，对别人的批评进行反批评，也是完全可以的，是正常的。决不能只许说反面的，不许说正面的。扣帽子也没有什么，只要不乱扣。
    三、孙晓村同志说我批评“统战部在参加宗派活动”，这是不实在的。请查一下5月14日人民日报的原文，我说的是“因而曾经助长了一些独裁作风和家长作风。自然也就助长了宗派活动。……看起来有时似乎统战部在参加宗派活动。实际上，今天在民主党派中进行宗派活动，如果不是若隐若显地拿起统战部的幌子，是不大可能的”。说“助长”，说“看起来似乎”，说“幌子”，这同孙晓村同志的“在参加”是有多大的出入呢？这是有意的睁开眼睛撒谎，还是健忘呢？他还说，民建内部有左、中、右的分别，有一些人的看法与党的方针、政策比较一致，这是对的。但我要再问一下：在党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和“长期共存、互相监督”的方针之后，居然还有人对思想问题组织“围剿”，这是不是与党的方针、政策一致的呢？他还谈到骨干分子是否参加宗派活动的问题。我的看法是：骨干分子一般地不会参加宗派活动；骨干分子参加宗派活动，是领导人的宗派主义造成的。
    四、吴大琨同志批评我曲解了斯大林“共产党员是特殊材料制成的”一句话。首先我不同意他的方法。这一句话对某些党员会起到什么影响，我认为应该从客观实际去找。这样，整风期间报纸上的报道就已经提出不少的材料了。吴大琨同志刚刚相反，他从列宁文选里去找，找出斯大林演说的全文来谈问题。这是标准的教条主义的方法。应该问一问：究竟是联共党史发行的广泛呢，还是列宁文选发行的广泛？究竟有多少人能同吴大琨同志那样，在读联共党史的时候要到列宁选集里去找根据？自然，即使找出了根据，仍然不能说明斯大林这句话是科学的。吴大琨同志还说：“章乃器同志说在‘过五关’之后还要有‘脱胎换骨’‘抽筋剥皮’的最后一关”。这不是睁开眼睛撒谎，便是健忘。我所说的是可以被敌人用来进行反宣传，在“脱胎换骨”之下加上“抽筋剥皮”。吴大琨同志这样的辩论作风，究竟正派不正派，是值得他考虑的。
    五、此外，还有些类似谩骂的“批评”，我认为不值得争辩；的确，群众是能够辨善恶的。有许多有关理论性的问题，请大家在我所写的“关于中国民族资产阶级两面性问题”和“关于工商改造辅导工作的几个问题”发表以后，再给以批评，我也暂不作答。关于我在“工商界”发表的文章用了民建副主任委员的头衔一点，我要说明：我从来发表文章都不愿用什么头衔，这次是由于“工商界”编者的要求我才同意的。我也没有理由不同意，因为我的确负有这样的头衔。同时，用了这样的头衔，也不意味着就代表什么组织。文章总是表达自己个人的意见的。所以，我也看不到任何人有权利可以制止一个人发表文章用头衔。对这点，我毫无成见，请法学家加以研究吧！
    六、最后，我愿意告诉工商界：整风运动是一定要进行到底的；共产党绝不会做半途而废的事情。共产党代表了工人阶级忠诚老实的品质，是不会表面一套、里面一套的。我们要完全相信党的方针、政策，用老老实实、实事求是的态度揭发矛盾，帮助党做好整风工作。不要怕扣帽子，更不要怕受打击。整风运动从某一些角落来看，肯定会有曲折，肯定会有过“左”、过右的偏向，但党是会明是非的。是非最后也一定会明的。
