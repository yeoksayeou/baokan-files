    Li Weihan Says at a Symposium of Democratic Personages Held by the United Front Work Department that Socialism is the Political Basis for Long-Term Coexistence
    He said: The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to the criticisms and suggestions made at the symposium. Generally speaking, many of the criticisms and suggestions from all sides are correct and should be seriously accepted and handled; a considerable part are incorrect and need further study and analysis.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, inviting responsible persons of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, concluded on the afternoon of June 3. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the meeting.
    Li Weihan said: Our symposium started on May 8 and has held thirteen sessions so far, with more than seventy friends speaking. Everyone's speeches touched on many important issues in the country's political life and the people's democratic united front, and put forward many criticisms and suggestions. These have all been published in the newspapers. The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to these criticisms and suggestions.
    Our symposium has already agreed to establish a bi-weekly symposium for democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, and to establish a discussion group on issues related to the work of democratic parties. The issues and opinions raised at the symposium are being sorted out by a nine-person group. Those that can be submitted to the bi-weekly symposium and discussion group for study and handling will be transferred separately; those that should be submitted to other relevant parties for study and handling will also be transferred separately.
    Undoubtedly, subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism exist in the work of the CPC's United Front Work Department. Because the rectification campaign has just begun, we cannot yet make the necessary analyses, assessments, and conclusions. We need to solicit more criticisms and suggestions from our friends, and we also need to combine this with our own self-examination to conduct analyses and research. In the process of the rectification campaign, we will simultaneously pay attention to correcting shortcomings and errors and improving our work. When the time is right, we will consult with our friends again.
    Many friends have suggested that mutual supervision and assistance should be further strengthened in the future. We believe this should be done. For the CPC, this is an established policy. The CPC sincerely welcomes the supervision and assistance of various democratic parties and non-party personages. In recent months, the large number of criticisms and suggestions put forward by democratic parties and non-party personages across the country fully demonstrates that this kind of supervision and assistance is essential. Many criticisms and suggestions greatly help the CPC to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism within its own ranks, and further strengthen and consolidate its core leading role in the national people and socialist construction.
    There is a political basis for long-term coexistence between the CPC and the various democratic parties, and that is the fundamental interests of the socialist road and socialist construction. Between the parties, especially between the CPC and the various democratic parties, not only should they take the Constitution of the People's Republic of China as the criterion, respect each other's equal and independent status, but also, based on the fundamental interests of socialist construction, implement mutual supervision and assistance, then they will definitely be able to coexist well for a long time and cooperate well for a long time. Many friends have criticized us for not providing enough political and ideological assistance to the democratic parties and democratic personages, not providing enough help to the unity and progress of the democratic parties and democratic personages, and not providing enough help to certain specific needs in the work of the democratic parties. Our comrades will pay attention to these criticisms. We will, in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the fundamental interests of socialist construction, improve our work in these areas with the help of our friends.
    Generally speaking, we believe that many of the criticisms and suggestions put forward from all sides are correct and should be seriously accepted and handled; a considerable part are incorrect and need further study and analysis.
    Now our symposium is declared over, and I extend my heartfelt thanks to our friends.
    Before Li Weihan spoke, the symposium discussed the establishment of a bi-weekly symposium for democratic parties and non-party democratic personages and a discussion group on issues related to the work of democratic parties. Everyone agreed to establish the bi-weekly symposium and the discussion group.
    At the previous sessions of this symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, a nine-person group was formed, consisting of Zhang Zhiyi (CPC), Shao Lizi (KMT Revolutionary Committee), Luo Longji (China Democratic League), Tan Zhiqing (China National Democratic Construction Association), Xu Guangping (China Association for Promoting Democracy), Huang Qixiang (Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), Yan Xichun (China Zhi Gong Party), Mao Yisheng (Jiusan Society), and Li Chunqing (Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League), to review the handling of the forty-eight opinions raised at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee last year. At the symposium on the afternoon of the 3rd, Huang Qixiang, on behalf of the nine-person group, gave an explanation of the review. He pointed out that most of the forty-eight opinions have been dealt with; a few have become non-existent because of changes in circumstances; and a few should be handled by the democratic parties.

    李维汉在统战部召开的民主人士座谈会上说
    社会主义是长期共存的政治基础
    他说：中共中央十分重视在座谈会上提出的批评和意见。总的说来，从各方面提出的批评和意见，有很多是正确的，应该认真地加以接受和处理；有相当一部分是错误的，还需要进一步加以研究和分析。
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部邀请各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会在6月3日下午结束。中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉在会上讲了话。
    李维汉说：我们的座谈会从5月8日开始到现在，举行了十三次，有七十多位朋友讲了话。大家的讲话接触到国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线的许多重要问题，提出了许多批评和意见。这些都在各报发表了。中共中央十分重视这些批评和意见。
    我们的座谈会已经协议成立民主党派和无党派民主人士双周座谈会，成立有关民主党派工作问题的讨论会。座谈会上提出的问题和意见，正在由九人小组进行整理，凡是可以交由双周座谈会和讨论会去研究处理的，都分别移交过去；应该交由其他有关方面研究处理的，也要分别转交过去。
    主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的毛病，在中共统一战线工作部门的工作中无疑地是存在着的。因为整风刚开始，我们还不可能作出必要的分析、估计和结论。我们还要更多地征求朋友们的批评和意见，还要结合我们自己的检查来进行分析和研究。在整风过程中，我们将同时注意纠正缺点、错误，改进工作。到了适当的时候，我们还会再向朋友们请教。
    许多朋友提出，今后要进一步加强互相间的监督和帮助。我们认为应该这样作。对于中共来说，这是一个既定的方针。中共诚恳地欢迎各民主党派和党外人士的监督和帮助。最近几个月里，全国范围内民主党派和党外人士所提出的大量的批评和意见，就充分地说明了这种监督和帮助是必不可少的。有很多的批评和意见大大有助于中共克服自己队伍中的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，进一步加强和巩固自己在全国人民和社会主义建设中的核心领导作用。
    中共和各民主党派之间是存在着长期共存的政治基础的，这就是社会主义道路和社会主义建设的根本利益。各党派之间，尤其是中共和各民主党派之间，既以中华人民共和国宪法为准则，互相尊重平等、独立的地位，又能以社会主义建设的根本利益为依据，实行互相间的监督和帮助，就一定能够长期共存得好，长期合作得好。许多朋友批评我们在政治上和思想上帮助民主党派和民主人士不够，对民主党派和民主人士的团结和进步帮助不够，对民主党派工作中的某些具体需要帮助不够。我们的同志会重视这些批评的。我们将根据中华人民共和国宪法和社会主义建设的根本利益，在取得朋友们的帮助之下，来改进我们在这些方面的工作。
    总的说来，从各方面提出的批评和意见，我们认为有很多是正确的，应该认真地加以接受和处理；有相当一部分是错误的，还需要进一步加以研究和分析。
    现在我们的座谈会宣告结束，我向朋友们致衷心的感谢。
    在李维汉讲话以前，座谈会商讨了建立民主党派和无党派民主人士双周座谈会和民主党派工作问题讨论会的问题。大家同意建立双周座谈会和民主党派工作问题讨论会。
    在中共中央统战部前几次举行的这个座谈会上，曾由张执一（中共）、邵力子（民革）、罗隆基（民盟）、谭志清（民建）、许广平（民进）、黄琪翔（农工）、严希纯（致公）、茅以升（九三）、李纯青（台盟）组成九人小组，对在去年中共中央统战部举行的座谈会上提出来的四十八条意见的处理情况进行检查。在3日下午的座谈会上，黄琪翔代表九人小组对检查情况作了说明。他指出，这四十八条意见，绝大部分已经得到处理；有几条因为情况发生变化，问题已经不存在；有几条是应当由民主党派处理的。
