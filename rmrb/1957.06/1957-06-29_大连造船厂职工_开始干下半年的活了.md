Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, June 28th. Workers at the state-owned Dalian Shipyard completed the first half of the year's state plan six days ahead of schedule.

In the first half of the year, seventeen new ships of various sizes were built here, including a 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat, coastal passenger boats, and automated cargo barges. At the same time, ten giant ocean-going freighters and ocean tugboats were repaired.

Now, the shipyard's docks, slipways, and wharves are full of ships. Workers are working hard to build thirty-eight new ships of various sizes and repair nineteen ocean-going giants. In the ship parts workshop, a sixteen-meter-long lathe is slowly turning, and the famous model worker Zhan Shuijing is cutting the crankshaft of a giant ship here. He is already working on the second half of the year's tasks.

A 4,500-ton ocean-going oil tanker is docked on the slipway, its hull as high as six or seven stories. Many welders, wearing masks, are welding the hull's steel plates. This oil tanker has a displacement of 7,100 tons and a hull length of 110 meters, making it the largest oil tanker currently manufactured in China.

Another 5,000-ton domestic ocean-going freighter is also being actively prepared for construction. This modern ship was designed by China itself. It is 115.5 meters long, has a displacement of 8,730 tons, and can reach a speed of 12.6 knots per hour at sea. (Attached picture)

　　大连造船厂职工
    开始干下半年的活了
    新华社旅大28日电　国营大连造船厂提前六天完成了上半年国家计划。
    上半年，这里新造成的大小轮船有十七艘，其中有一千二百匹马力的远洋拖船，近海客艇，自动运货驳船等；同时，还修理出十艘巨大的远洋货船、海洋拖船。
    现在，在造船厂的船坞中、船台上和码头旁，轮船挤得满满的。工人们正在紧张地新造大小三十八艘轮船，修理十九艘远洋巨轮。轮船机件车间里，十六公尺长的大车床在徐徐转动，著名劳动模范詹水晶正在这里切削着巨轮的曲轴。他已经在干下半年的活了。
    载重量四千五百吨的远洋油轮，停在船台上，船体有六、七层楼房那么高。许多电焊手，戴着面罩，正在焊接船体钢板。这艘油轮排水量有七千一百吨，船体长一百一十公尺，是我国目前制造的最大的一艘油轮。
    另一艘载量五千吨的国产远洋货轮，也正在积极准备开工。这艘近代化轮船是由我国自己设计的，它身长一百一十五点五公尺，排水量达八千七百三十吨，在海上每小时的航速可达十二点六浬。（附图片）
