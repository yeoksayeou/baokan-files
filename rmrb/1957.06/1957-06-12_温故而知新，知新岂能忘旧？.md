　　Reviewing the Old to Know the New; Knowing the New, How Can We Forget the Old?
　　Comrade Editor:
    Today, our living standards are generally higher than before liberation. Mr. Ge Peiqi doesn't believe it. Please take a look at these photos I took on the streets of Shanghai in early 1949, on the eve of liberation. At that time, the Kuomintang government was facing its imminent collapse, with rampant inflation. The value of the Gold Yuan note reached as high as 100,000 yuan per note (which still couldn't buy a few liters of rice). Prices rose several times a day, and people were in a state of constant anxiety. Factory owners couldn't pay wages, so they gave some of their products to workers to sell for a living. This situation is hard to describe in words.
    Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the new China features: first, massive construction; second, stable prices; and third, social stability, with new social customs and a brand-new outlook. Everyone's life is becoming more and more interesting and promising.
    Knowing the new, we cannot forget the old; remembering the old, we understand the value of the new. Mr. Ge, I suggest you go to factories and the countryside to take a look (even if it's just a quick glance) and see if things are as you say.

### 温故而知新，知新岂能忘旧？

　　温故而知新，知新岂能忘旧？
　　编辑同志：
    今天我们的生活水平，普遍地比解放前提高了。葛佩琦先生不信，请看看这几张我在1949年初解放前夕，在上海街头拍摄的照片。那时正是国民党政府面临崩溃前夜，通货膨胀，金元券票值有一张高至十万元者（还买不到几升米）。物价一夕数涨，人心惶惶不可终日。工厂老板发不出工资，就把一部分产品交给工人作价变卖度日。此情此景，一言难尽。
    今天中国共产党领导的新中国是怎样，一是大建设，二是物价稳，三是人心定，出现了新的社会风尚和簇新面貌。大家过日子一天比一天有意思，有奔头。
    知新不可忘旧，念旧始知新的可贵。葛先生，建议你下厂下乡走走看看（即使是走马看花也好），是不是像你所说那样。
