Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th. Soviet scientists have recently created a machine that turns words into sounds. This machine, called a "sound synthesizer," can not only produce human voices but also the sounds of certain (currently only six) musical instruments, thereby allowing certain musical works to be played without instrumentalists.

The machine has two parts: one is a keyboard for punching holes, which looks very much like a regular typewriter keyboard, with each line able to punch eighteen holes simultaneously, turning the article that needs to be converted into sound into symbols according to the needs of pitch, timbre, and sound. The other part is a sound-emitting device, including eighteen photoelectric tubes and many sound-producing vibration chambers and auxiliary chambers, which convert the symbols into sounds. Some of the photoelectric tubes control the pitch, some adjust the timbre, some control the rise and fall and length of the sound, and some control the sound. The vibration chambers and auxiliary chambers cooperate with each other under the adjustment of the photoelectric tubes to emit sounds with various pitches and timbres. In use, first, the article that needs to be converted into sound is punched with many small holes on paper tape using the keyboard. Then, the paper tape with small holes moves line by line in front of the photoelectric tubes. When small hole symbols appear in front of the photoelectric tubes, they cause the vibration chambers and auxiliary chambers to cooperate and emit sounds according to the needs of the symbols.

    苏联科学家制成“声音综合器”
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联科学家最近制成了一种把文字变成声音的机器。这种名为“声音综合器”的机器不仅可以产生人的声音，而且可以产生某些（目前只有六种）乐器的声音，从而可以不用乐器演奏者而奏出某些音乐作品。
    这种机器有两部分，一部分是打孔用的键盘，外貌极像一般打字机的键盘，每行可以同时打十八个孔，按音调、音色、音响等各方面的需要，把需要变成声音的文章变成符号。一部分是发出声音的装置，包括十八个光电管和许多发音的振动室、辅助室，把符号变成声音。光电管中有些是控制音调的，有些是调节音色的，有些是控制声音的起落和长短的，还有一些是控制音响的。振动室和辅助室则因为光电管的调节而配合起来，发出具有各种音调和音色的声音。使用的时候，首先把需要变成声音的文章，用键盘在纸带上打出许多小孔。然后，带小孔的纸带一行一行顺序在光电管前移动。在光电管前出现小孔符号的时候，它们就根据符号的需要使振动室和辅助室配合起来发出声音了。
