Resolutely Struggle Against Rightist Elements
Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    Chairman Mao Zedong's recently published article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a powerful ideological weapon. It will arm the minds of the people, correctly handle contradictions among the people, and advance our socialist cause. It will encourage the people of the whole country to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all erroneous words and deeds that oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose socialism.

    The war "hurdle" has passed, and the land reform "hurdle" has also passed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have passed these two "hurdles" well, with achievements and progress for everyone. The struggle to establish socialist ownership of the means of production and to establish a socialist political system has also achieved great success, and the people of the whole country have made tremendous progress under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of the whole country love and support the Communist Party and are striving hard for the socialist cause. However, the political and ideological struggle of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism" in the minds of a considerable number of people has not yet achieved a socialist victory. The capitalist ideology of some people is exuding a stench, and individual political careerists are still妄想妄想 to steer the socialist train onto the capitalist track. Therefore, we cannot say that the socialist revolution "hurdle" has been completely crossed; nor can we say that the class struggle has been extinguished, and the class struggle on the ideological front has stopped. The shocking words and deeds of rightist elements exposed recently are proof of this.

    These rightist elements must be fully exposed, and these rightist elements must be sharply criticized!

    We must resolutely consolidate the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and resolutely consolidate the young socialist system to repel the rampant and arrogant attacks of rightist elements and individual political careerists.

    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and its members must clearly raise the banner of socialism in this struggle and fight against the erroneous words and deeds of rightist elements inside and outside the KMT Revolutionary Committee. A sharp question is before us: Where is the KMT Revolutionary Committee going? Is it to follow the Communist Party forever, support socialism, and strengthen the KMT Revolutionary Committee; or is it to weaken and degenerate the KMT Revolutionary Committee? I think we can only take the former path. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's article, and use the six political criteria put forward in the article as weapons, to carry out a rectification movement against rightist elements within the KMT Revolutionary Committee in a serious and earnest manner. In the rectification movement, we must sincerely ask the Chinese Communist Party for help, and at the same time correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism within the KMT Revolutionary Committee, so that all our KMT Revolutionary Committee members can draw a clear line between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology in the rectification movement, stand firm on the socialist position, and successfully pass the socialist revolution "hurdle." Only in this way can the KMT Revolutionary Committee be said to have inherited and carried forward Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition. And only in this way can the KMT Revolutionary Committee achieve true "long-term coexistence" with the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties on the socialist political basis.

　　同右派分子作坚决斗争
　　中国国民党革命委员会副主席　程潜
    最近发表的毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文章，是一个强大有力的思想武器，它将武装全国人民的头脑，正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，推进我们的社会主义事业。它将鼓舞全国人民，向一切反对党的领导、反社会主义的错误言论和行动作不调和的斗争。
    战争“关”过去了，土地改革“关”也过去了。全国人民在中国共产党领导下，这两“关”过得很好，有成绩，大家也有进步。建立生产资料的社会主义所有制和建立社会主义的政治制度的斗争，也取得了伟大的成绩，全国人民在中国共产党的领导下也有巨大的进步。现在，全国的工人、农民和革命的知识分子，热爱和拥护共产党，正在淬厉奋发地为社会主义事业努力劳动。但是，相当大一部分人们头脑中所进行的“破资本主义、立社会主义”的政治思想斗争，还远未能取得社会主义胜利的结局。有些人的资本主义思想在发散着臭味，个别政治野心家还在妄想将社会主义的列车驶向资本主义的轨道上去。因此，还不能说，社会主义革命这一“关”已经完整地渡过；更不能说，阶级斗争已经熄灭，思想战线上的阶级斗争已经停止。最近期间暴露的怵目惊心的右派分子的言论和行动，就是一个明证。
    必须充分地揭露这些右派分子，必须尖锐地批判这些右派分子！
    必须坚决地巩固中国共产党的领导，必须坚决地巩固人民民主专政，必须坚决地巩固年青的社会主义制度，以回击右派分子和个别政治野心家的猖狂嚣张的进攻。
    中国国民党革命委员会及其成员，在这场斗争中要鲜明地擎起社会主义的大旗，向民革党内外的右派分子的错误言行进行斗争。尖锐的问题摆在我们面前：民革往何处去？是永远地跟共产党走，拥护社会主义，使民革组织坚强起来；还是相反地使民革组织涣散蜕化下去？我认为，我们只能走前一条道路。认真地学习毛主席的文章，以文章中所提出的六项政治标准为武器，在民革内部严肃认真地开展反右派斗争的整风运动。在整风运动中，我们要诚恳地请求中国共产党给予帮助，同时在民革内部正确地开展批评和自我批评，使我们所有的民革成员能在整风运动中划清社会主义思想与资本主义思想的界限，站稳社会主义的立场，胜利地过好社会主义革命这一“关”。只有这样，民革才算是继承和发扬光大了孙中山先生的革命传统。也只有这样，民革才能在社会主义的政治基础上和中国共产党、各民主党派作到真正的“长期共存”。
