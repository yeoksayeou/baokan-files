　　Teachers, Students, and Staff of Ten Thousand Hold Rally
    Tsinghua University Criticizes Huang Wanli
    (Our Newspaper) News: The Student Union and the Trade Union of Tsinghua University convened a school-wide rally of over ten thousand teachers, students, and staff on the 28th to criticize the reactionary statements of Huang Wanli, professor of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering and author of the reactionary novel "Small Talk Among Flowers." Despite the sweltering heat, with the temperature reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit, the auditorium, classrooms, and lawns were packed with over ten thousand teachers, students, and staff filled with fervent emotion. At the rally, professors, students, and school staff sternly refuted Huang Wanli's reactionary novel "Small Talk Among Flowers" and his statements against socialism and against the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Huang Wanli said that the part in "Small Talk Among Flowers" where he cursed the government as a "turtle egg" (a derogatory term) for the road surface being churned up was due to the American-worshipping thoughts in his mind and his admiration for the superficial democracy of the American political system. He admitted that creating the term "Goethe-Dante School" was a blow to the activists and had a bad effect. The unrealistic satire of certain activists in the novel uglified the relationship between the Party and the masses, and he was willing to apologize to these comrades. Finally, he said: "The reason for these problems is that socialism is developing too fast, and I usually don't pay enough attention to politics and can't keep up with the development of society."
    Following Huang Wanli's speech, Zhang Ren, a lecturer in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, spoke next. He pointed out that although Huang Wanli admitted that his novel had a bad influence, he did not thoroughly examine his position in writing this novel or his motivation for writing it. He pointed out that Huang Wanli claimed to be "active" in helping the Party rectify its work style, but what was he "active" in? Huang Wanli once said that the Communist Party has shortcomings, and there are only two ways to deal with these shortcomings: overthrow it or correct it. The Communist Party is too powerful, so it is impossible to overthrow it, only to correct it. This shows that Huang Wanli is actually trying to take the opportunity of rectification to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Wang Zunming, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, pointed out that Huang Wanli's novel "Small Talk Among Flowers" essentially exaggerates the individual shortcomings of the Party and the government into comprehensive ones; it opposes the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, and praises the American bourgeoisie's set of "democracy." He said: "Huang Wanli's novel actually played a coordinating role with the anti-socialist remarks of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others. Our country's steel production increased by 1.61 million tons in the past year alone; the number of college students is now about four times what it was ten years ago, and the health and food of students have greatly improved compared to before liberation. Why didn't Mr. Huang mention these facts at all?"
    Li Yonglu, an old worker from the Department of Power Machinery, and student Wang Zhenhai refuted Huang Wanli's vicious statement that "more than nine-tenths of the people are regarded as Adous, and the heads of less than one-tenth of the people are considered to be intelligent and should play a dominant role." Li Yonglu, who has 33 years of work experience, said that in 1952, when I was elected as a district people's representative, I saw that the representatives submitted more than 1,600 proposals at the district people's congress. After discussion at the meeting, the proposals were divided into three categories: those that could be handled, those that could be handled or not, and those that could not be handled at present. Those that could be handled were urged to be done by the government, and those that could not be handled were also explained to the voters. Are so many people Adous who are dominated by others? Student Wang Zhenhai said that Mr. Huang thinks we are all Adous. Before liberation, I was a poor boy, a bumpkin who could only wear a pair of torn shorts. Today, I have become a college student and can stand on the podium and argue with a dignified university professor. This is being the master of our own affairs, not an Adou who is at the disposal of others.
    Li Piji, a professor in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, revealed that the satire in "Small Talk Among Flowers" that a certain Zhang had a set of opinions on governing the Yellow River, but abandoned his opinions when the Sanmenxia plan came out, and echoed by saying "The Yellow River will be clear when a sage appears," is completely a distortion of the facts. Zhang refers to Zhang Hanying, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, who wrote an article as early as 1949 discussing his opinions on governing the Yellow River. Today's Sanmenxia plan is roughly the same as his original opinions. Huang Wanli intentionally reversed right and wrong.
    During the meeting, people kept passing notes to the chairman, asking Huang Wanli to explain his motivation for writing "Small Talk Among Flowers," to explain the background of the novel, and who the characters in the novel represented. Some students were unable to speak on stage due to lack of time, and they submitted their written speeches to the chairman.

### 师生员工万人集会  清华大学批判黄万里

　　师生员工万人集会
    清华大学批判黄万里
    本报讯　清华大学学生会和工会在28日召开了批判反动小说“花丛小语”的作者、水利系教授黄万里反动言论的全校师生员工大会。虽然天气酷热，温度达到了华氏九十五度，可是大礼堂、教室内、草坪上还是挤满了感情激愤的师生员工一万多人。会上教授、学生、校工严正地驳斥了黄万里的反动小说“花丛小语”和他反对社会主义、反对共产党的领导的言论。
    黄万里说，“花丛小语”中谈到的因马路翻浆骂政府忘八蛋是由于自己脑中存在着崇美思想，羡慕美国政治制度的表面上的民主。他承认创造了“歌德——但丁派”的名词是对积极分子的打击，起了坏作用。小说中对某些积极分子作的不符合实际的讽刺是丑化了党群的关系，他愿意向这些同志道歉。最后，他说：“产生这些问题的原因是社会主义发展快，自己平日对政治不太注意，跟不上社会的发展。”
    黄万里发言后，紧接着发言的是水利系讲师张仁，他指出了黄万里虽然承认了他写的小说产生了不好的影响，但是对他站在什么立场写这篇小说？他写这篇小说的动机是什么都没有彻底检查。他指出黄万里在帮助党整风中自认是“积极”的，但他“积极”的是些什么？黄万里曾说过，共产党是有缺点的，对付这种缺点只有两种办法：打倒它和改正它。共产党太强大了，打倒它不可能，只能改正它。这说明黄万里实际上是企图假借整风之名而行其取消共产党的领导之实。
    机械制造系教授王遵明指出，黄万里小说“花丛小语”实质上是将党和政府的个别缺点夸大成全面；是反对党的领导和社会主义的制度，歌颂了美国资产阶级的一套“民主”。他说：“黄万里的这篇小说实际上是与章伯钧、罗隆基等反社会主义言论起了配合作用。我们国家钢的产量单去年一年便增加了一百六十一万吨；现在大学生的人数约为十年前的四倍，同学的健康和伙食较解放前都大有改善，对这些事实黄先生为什么却只字不提。
    动力机械系的老工人李永禄和学生王振海对黄万里所说的“十分之九以上的人被当作阿斗，十分之一以下的人的脑袋被认为是灵的，而应起主宰的作用”的恶毒言论作了有力的驳斥。有三十三年工龄的李永禄说，在1952年我被选为区人民代表时，在区人民代表会议上，我看到代表们提出了一千六百多件提案，在会上经过讨论，将提案分成能办、可办可不办、目前不能办三类，能办的督促政府做了，不能办的也向选民解释清楚。难道这样多的人都是受人主宰的阿斗吗？学生王振海说，黄先生认为我们都是阿斗，解放前像我这样只能穿上一条破裤叉的穷小子、土包子，今天成了大学生，能站在讲台上和堂堂的大学教授争论，这便是当家作主，不是任人支配的阿斗。
    水利系教授李丕济揭露了“花丛小语”中讽刺章某原来有一套治理黄河的意见，等三门峡计划一出便放弃己见，并且附和着说“圣人出而黄河清”，根本是歪曲事实，章某即指的是水利部张含英副部长，他早在1949年便写文章论述了治黄的意见，今天的三门峡计划大致上是与他原来意见相同的。黄万里完全是有意地颠倒是非。
    在大会的进行期间，不断地有人递条子给主席，要黄万里讲清楚写“花丛小语”的动机，交代小说的背景和小说中的人物代表谁？还有部分学生因时间不够不能上台发言，他们都向主席交了他们的书面发言。
