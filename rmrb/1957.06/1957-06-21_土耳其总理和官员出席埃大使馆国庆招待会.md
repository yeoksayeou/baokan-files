Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 20th: Turkish Prime Minister Menderes and some other senior Turkish officials attended the official reception held by the Egyptian Embassy in Turkey on June 18 to celebrate Egypt's National Day.

According to Western news agency reports, because relations between Egypt and Turkey have been quite cold in recent years, mainly due to the Baghdad Pact, "observers" attach particular importance to the Turkish Prime Minister's sudden attendance at the reception.

Prior to this, when the Egyptian national team and the Turkish team held a football match in Istanbul in May, Menderes disregarded the seat specially prepared for him and sat among many Egyptians, including Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires Osman Asal. Western news agencies believe that this also shows a trend of improving Egyptian-Turkish relations. The positions of ambassadors of the two countries, which have been vacant for a long time, have recently been filled.

　　土耳其总理和官员出席埃大使馆国庆招待会
    据新华社20日讯安卡拉消息：土耳其总理曼德列斯和一些其它土耳其高级官员6月18日出席了埃及驻土耳其大使馆举行的庆祝埃及国庆日的正式招待会。
    据西方通讯社报道，由于埃土两国在近年来主要因为巴格达条约的关系彼此一直相当冷淡，因此“观察家们”对土耳其总理忽然出席招待会一事特别重视。
    在这以前，5月间埃及国家队和土耳其队在伊斯坦布尔举行足球赛时，曼德列斯曾经不顾特地为他准备的席位而坐到许多埃及人中间，其中包括埃及代办欧斯曼·阿萨尔。西方通讯社认为，这也表明埃土关系有改善的趋势。许久以来一直空着的两国的大使职位最近都已经任命了。
