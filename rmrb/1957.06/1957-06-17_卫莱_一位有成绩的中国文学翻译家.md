　　Wei Lai - A Successful Translator of Chinese Literature
　　Ye Junjian
　　Western translation of Chinese literary works has a history of more than one hundred years. However, due to the difficulty of Chinese characters and the vast difference between traditional Chinese literary forms and European traditional literary forms, it is almost impossible to translate classical Chinese literary works into Western languages that are both readable and retain the style of the original. The most typical example is the translation of Chinese poetry. For example, the "Three Hundred Tang Poems" that we are familiar with were translated by someone in England very early on. Some people used the traditional English iambic pentameter, composed of one unstressed and one stressed syllable, and the rhyme scheme of AABA (a rhyme scheme from Persian literature, introduced by the famous English translator Edward FitzGerald when he translated "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam") to translate quatrains and five-character律诗 (lǜshī, regulated verse), but it never sounds like Chinese poetry. At the same time, due to the limitations of rhyme and meter, the content of the original poem is also distorted. Some translators went to the other extreme, translating Chinese poems word-for-word and line-by-line according to the original form, without considering whether the translation conformed to English habits. This method of translation is very faithful, but it tastes like chewing wax and has no poetic sense at all. In general, the translation of Chinese poetry has been a failure.

　　Forty years ago, a young British translator, Arthur Waley, published a collection called "One Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems." In this collection, in addition to some Tang poems, he also collected some representative ancient poems. It immediately attracted the attention of the British literary world, because they discovered not only the new artistic conception of poetry in Chinese poems, but also new techniques for writing poetry. In their opinion, Chinese poets, such as Li Bai and Du Fu, have a special ability, that is, they can write all kinds of things, big and small, in life into poetry, and it is poetry with human touch, realism, and therefore can arouse resonance. War, hunger, love, hard work, meeting friends, gray hair, children being stupid at studying, etc., can all become the themes of poetry. At the same time, poetry does not become vulgar because of these themes. On the contrary, it is very elegant, because it can appeal to the noblest emotions of mankind. Similarly, Chinese poets are also very honest and simple when dealing with these themes. Their language is approachable, and they directly express what is in their hearts, without making people feel the slightest affectation. This technique further strengthens the realism of the content. On the eve of the economic panic in the West, when many poets were pursuing various surrealist forms, this simple and healthy poetry was naturally welcomed by the majority of readers.

　　This success is of course inseparable from the translator's talent and efforts. Waley explored a form suitable for expressing Chinese poetry. He used a "sprung rhythm" to express the unique rhythm in Chinese poetry. The basic characteristic of this "rhythm" is that a stressed syllable is followed by one or several unstressed syllables, and alliteration is sometimes used between words instead of rhyme. This combination can be appropriately changed in different poems, so it has flexibility; at the same time, the translator can use different words to form new meanings, so that he can faithfully express the content of the original poem without being restricted by rhyme. Whether using this form to translate Chinese poetry is an ideal method is certainly still worth discussing. However, Waley displayed his genius in this form - it can also be said that his talented translation gave this form new life. His translation of Chinese poetry has become a beautiful flower in modern British poetry, and has been loved by readers for forty years.

　　Waley has never been to China. His Chinese was self-taught. Since publishing his first collection of Chinese poems in 1918, he published a second collection of Chinese poems in 1919, and a third collection of poems in 1923. After that, he devoted himself to the study of Chinese philosophy and literature. He studied Confucius, Mencius, Han Feizi, Lao Tzu, and the I Ching, and has specialized writings in this area. He also studied Chinese painting. Of course, his greatest achievement is the introduction of Chinese literature. In 1946, he published his fourth collection of Chinese poems, which included works by many classical Chinese poets, with Bai Juyi's works being the most numerous. Indeed, he loved Bai Juyi to such an extent that he also wrote a "Biography of Bai Juyi," published in 1949. In addition, he also translated "Journey to the West" (published in 1942); this book has always been a bestseller loved by adults and children in England.

　　Like in many other countries in Europe, there is a similar tradition in the British literary world: that good translated works (except for modern works and popular novels), like excellent original creations, are equally considered a contribution to the country's literature. FitzGerald's translation of "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam" has become classical British literature; similarly, Waley's translation of Chinese poetry has also become a new classical work in British literature. Therefore, Waley was elected as a fellow of the Cambridge Royal Society, and some time ago, the British "Poet Laureate" Masefield also awarded him the "Poetry Prize," and Queen Elizabeth of England personally awarded him the "Order of Merit."

　　We welcome Chinese literary works becoming a part of British literature, and similarly, we must translate excellent British literary masterpieces and turn them into our literary treasures. In this meaningful work of cultural exchange, Waley has undoubtedly set a good example.

　　卫莱——一位有成绩的中国文学翻译家
　　叶君健
    西方翻译中国的文学作品，已经有一百多年的历史。但是由于中国文字的困难和中国传统文学形式与欧洲传统文学形式的距离太远，把中国的古典文学作品译成可诵的而又不失原文风格的西方语言，几乎是不可能的事情。最典型的例子是中国诗的翻译。如我们所熟知的“唐诗三百首”，英国很早就有人译过。有人用英国传统的、由一轻一重两个音节组成的五音步和AABA这个形式的韵脚（这是波斯文学中的一种韵脚，由英国名翻译家费兹吉拉德译“鲁拜集”介绍过去的）来译绝句和五律，但读起总不像中国诗。同时由于韵脚和音步的限制，原诗的内容也就走样了。有的译者走向另一个极端，把中国诗依照原文的形式，逐字逐句地直译，也不讲求译文是否合乎英文的习惯。这种译法倒是非常忠实的，但读起来味如嚼蜡，毫无诗意。总的说来，中国诗的翻译是失败的。
    四十年前，一位年轻的英国翻译家阿塞·卫莱出版了一个集子，名“一百七十首中国诗”。这个集子里，除了一部分唐诗外，还收集了一些具有代表性的古诗。它立刻引起了英国文艺界的注意，因为他们在中国诗里面不仅发现了诗的新意境，同时也发现了写诗的新技巧。在他们看来，中国的诗人，如李白和杜甫，有一种特殊的本领，就是他们能把生活中的大大小小事情都写成诗，而且是具有人情味、真实感，因而能引起共鸣的诗。战争、饥饿、爱情、拉夫、会友、头发白了、小孩子读书很笨，等等，都能成为诗的题材，同时诗并不因为这类题材而变得庸俗，相反地，倒是非常高雅，因为它能诉诸人类最高尚的感情。同样，中国诗人处理这些题材的时候，也是非常老实和朴素的。他们的语句平易近人，直接把他们心里的话讲出来，丝毫不使人感到有矫揉造作的气味。这种技巧更加强了内容的真实感。在西方经济恐慌到来的前夕，当许多诗人正在追求种种超现实的形式主义的时候，这种朴素健康的诗，自然受到了广大读者的欢迎。
    这种成功当然是与译者的才能和努力分不开的。卫莱探索出了一种适宜于表达中国诗的形式。他运用一种“跳跃节奏”（Sprungrhythm）来表达中国诗中那种特有的格律。这种“节奏”的基本特点是一个重音后面跟着一个或数个轻音，字与字之间有时用同音字母（Alliteration），而不用韵脚。这种组合可以在不同的诗里而适当地变换，因之具有灵活性；同时译者又可以用不同的字组成新的意义，使他能忠实地表达出原诗的内容而不受韵脚的束缚。用这种形式来译中国诗，是不是理想的方法，当然还值得讨论。不过卫莱却在这种形式中舒展了他的天才——也可以说他的天才的译笔给这种形式赋予了新的生命。他译的中国诗成为了近代英国诗中的一朵鲜美的花，四十年来一直为读者所喜爱。
    卫莱并没有来过中国。他的中文是自修得来的。自从1918年出了第一部中国诗集后，他在1919年又出了第二部中国诗集，1923年又出了第三部诗集。此后他就埋头研究中国的哲学和文学。他研究过孔子、孟子、韩非子、老子和易经，并且在这方面有专门的著述。他对中国的绘画也有研究。当然他最大的成绩还是对于中国文学的介绍工作。1946年他出了第四部中国诗集，这里面收集了许多中国古典诗人的作品，其中以白居易的作品最多。的确，他对白居易爱好到这种程度，他还写了一部“白居易传”，于1949年出版。此外，他还译了“西游记”（1942年出版）；这部书一直是英国大人和小孩都爱读的畅销书。
    像在欧洲许多的其他的国家里一样，英国文学界也有一种同样的传统：即好的翻译作品（近代作品和通俗小说例外），和优秀的创作一样，同等地被认为是对本国文学的一种贡献。费兹吉拉得译的“鲁拜集”成了英国的古典文学；同样，卫莱译的中国诗也成了英国文学中的新古典作品。因此卫莱被剑桥皇家学院选为院士，前些时英国的“桂冠诗人”麦斯菲尔德还授与他“诗奖”，英国女皇伊丽莎白也亲自授予他“荣誉勋章”。
    我们欢迎中国文学作品变成为英国文学的一部分，同样我们也要把优秀的英国文学名著翻译过来，变成为我们的文学宝藏。在这件有意义的文化交流的工作上，卫莱无疑地树立了一个良好的榜样。
