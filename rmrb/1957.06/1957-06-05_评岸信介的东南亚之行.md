Commentary on Kishi Nobusuke's Southeast Asia Trip
By a Staff Commentator

Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's trip to five Southeast Asian countries, from his arrival in Rangoon on May 21 to his departure from Bangkok on June 2, has been completed according to schedule, covering Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Thailand. After that, he also made a hurried trip to Taipei. Kishi Nobusuke's Southeast Asian trip, as a "prelude" to his visit to the United States, has now come to an end.

Kishi Nobusuke inserted a visit to Southeast Asian countries as a "prelude" before going to Washington, mainly to prepare for his visit to the United States. He wanted to understand the political climate of these countries, to gauge their attitude towards "US-Japan cooperation" or Japan's "assistance in developing" Southeast Asia, in order to be in a more advantageous position when bargaining with the United States. Nevertheless, Kishi Nobusuke's visit to Southeast Asian countries, expressing his willingness to understand the situation of these countries and strengthen economic and cultural exchanges with them, cannot be said to be without certain positive significance.

In his talks with government officials of several Southeast Asian countries and in the joint statements issued, Kishi Nobusuke mentioned the prohibition of testing and using nuclear weapons and the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. This is welcome. However, the Japanese government's self-contradictory attitude on the issue of banning nuclear weapons has weakened the power of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's statements on this issue. On the one hand, the Japanese government calls for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, but on the other hand, it rejects the Soviet proposal, insists on the so-called prior registration system, and sends people to participate in the US hydrogen bomb tests in Nevada. Kishi Nobusuke also said: "If (Japan) possesses atomic weapons within the scope of self-defense, it does not violate the constitution." Such self-contradictory attitudes have aroused doubts and incomprehension among some people in Asian countries. After Kishi Nobusuke's talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Nehru stated at a press conference that regarding the issue of banning nuclear weapons, "mere registration and restrictions are not thorough." Indian Defense Minister Menon also said in his speech to the Indian Parliament that the "Japanese proposal" to require registration and restriction of nuclear weapons tests "can only further legitimize war." Regarding the issue of Asian peace and security, including the China issue, the differences of opinion between Kishi Nobusuke and the leaders of India, Burma, and other countries are also obvious. According to Japanese newspapers, Prime Minister Nehru openly criticized Kishi Nobusuke's policy at a press conference, saying: "Without recognizing a large country like China, there is no way to maintain peace." At a press conference in Burma, the atmosphere also became very tense because Kishi Nobusuke avoided answering the question of recognizing China. Although Kishi Nobusuke avoided publicly discussing the China issue in India, Burma, and other countries, he did not hide his unfriendly, even slanderous, attitude towards China elsewhere. His trip to Taiwan itself illustrates this point. He specifically ran to Taiwan, as if to use this action to show the United States that he did not bring back any anti-colonial sentiment or any neutralist ideas from the Southeast Asian countries. According to Japanese reporters, in New Delhi, people expressed doubt about Kishi Nobusuke's statement that he would not restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations but would expand trade, and this is not without reason. In fact, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not taken any active measures for Sino-Japanese trade to date; on the contrary, after the United Kingdom decided to act alone despite the US "embargo" policy, Kishi Nobusuke ignored domestic public opinion calling for following the UK's example and "regretted" the UK's action. All of these show that Kishi Nobusuke is afraid of harming the feelings of the United States. Therefore, the "independent" policy he touts is lightweight and has no substance. After the Chinese people in Taipei erupted in large-scale anti-American demonstrations, calls within the United States for changing Asian policy are also increasing. In this situation, it is doubtful whether Kishi Nobusuke's practice of continuing to follow US policy will be successful.

During his visit to five Southeast Asian countries, Kishi Nobusuke also discussed the issue of the Asian Development Fund with the leaders of various countries. In addition to the portion allocated by member states, the main source of the so-called Asian Development Fund is "aid" from the United States. This is another version of the development plan of "American funds, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources" that the Japanese ruling group has always yearned for. However, this plan has not received unanimous support. Southeast Asian countries are wary of Japan acting as a vanguard for "US aid." And it is also difficult for the United States to provide a sum of funds unconditionally. Burma refused "aid with a noose"; Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: "Asia needs economic assistance, but if it is entangled with military assistance, it will create new problems"; Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy agreed to strengthen bilateral relations with Japan in investment but did not agree to the establishment of a development fund; officials in Ceylon also expressed no interest in this fund. Therefore, Japanese financial circles can only make such an assessment of Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia, that is, they believe that "although there are few concrete results, it has opened the door for further in-depth contact, which is of great significance."

Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party Asanuma Ichio commented on Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia, saying: Kishi Nobusuke adopts different positions according to different countries, which is even worse than "opportunistic diplomacy," it is "Gypsy diplomacy." It can be said that this exposes Kishi Nobusuke's two-faced and double-dealing tactics of playing the so-called "two-China policy." It is doubtful whether Kishi Nobusuke can win the trust of Asian countries with this attitude and enable Japan to play a positive role in Asia. The "independent" color that Kishi Nobusuke showed in this Southeast Asian trip was very little, and the color of following the United States was very strong. It is equally doubtful what kind of "adjustment" he can make to the current unequal US-Japan relationship by going to the United States for negotiations with this "soft-boned" posture.

    评岸信介的东南亚之行
    本报评论员
    日本首相岸信介的东南亚五国之行，从5月21日抵达仰光，到6月2日离开曼谷，已按照预定日程走完了缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和泰国的旅程。在这以后，他还匆匆地到台北跑了一趟。岸信介作为访美“序幕”的东南亚之行至此已告结束。
    岸信介在去华盛顿之前，插进访问东南亚国家这样一个“序幕”，主要的目的是为访美作准备，是要了解一下这些国家的政治气候，摸一摸这些国家对于“日美合作”或由日本出面“协助开发”东南亚的态度，以便在同美国讨价还价的时候处于较有利的地位。尽管如此，岸信介这次去东南亚各国，表示愿意了解这些国家的情况，愿意加强同这些国家的经济和文化方面的交往，仍然不能不说是有着一定的积极意义的。
    岸信介在同东南亚几个国家的政府负责人员的会谈和发表的联合声明中，几乎都提到了禁止试验和使用核武器，维护亚洲和世界的和平问题。这是值得欢迎的。但是日本政府在禁止试验核武器问题上的自相矛盾的态度，却减弱了岸信介首相在这一问题上发言的力量。日本政府一方面呼吁禁止核武器，一方面却拒绝苏联的提案，坚持所谓事先登记制度，同时又派人参加美国内华达州的氢弹试验，岸信介还说过：“如果在自卫的范围内（日本）拥有原子武器是不违反宪法的”。诸如此类自相矛盾的态度，已引起亚洲国家一些人士的疑惑不解。岸信介同印度总理尼赫鲁会谈之后，尼赫鲁在记者招待会上就曾表示，关于禁止核武器问题，“光是登记、限制，是不彻底的”。印度国防部长梅农在印度国会上的演说中也说，要求登记、限制核武器试验的“日本提案，只能使战争更加合法化”。关于包括中国问题在内的亚洲和平与安全问题，岸信介同印、缅等国家领导人员的意见的不一致，也是明显的。据日本报纸透露：尼赫鲁总理在记者招待会上曾正面批判岸信介的政策说：“不承认中国这样一个大国，就谈不到维持和平”。在缅甸的记者招待会上，由于岸信介避开回答承认中国问题，空气也弄得很僵。岸信介虽然在印、缅等国家避免公开地多谈论中国问题，但在别的地方，他并没有掩饰他对中国的不友好的、甚至诽谤的态度。他的台湾之行本身也就说明了这个问题。他特地跑到台湾去，仿佛是想用这个行动向美国表示：他从东南亚国家并没有带回来任何反殖民主义情绪或任何中立主义想法。据日本记者报道：在新德里，人们对岸信介所说的不恢复日中邦交，但要扩大贸易的可能性表示怀疑，这是不无原因的。事实上，岸信介政府至今对于日中贸易没有采取任何积极措施；相反的，在英国不顾美国的“禁运”政策决定单独干之后，岸信介竟不顾国内要求效法英国的舆论，对英国的行动“感到遗憾”。这些都说明岸信介生怕损伤美国的情绪，因此，他所标榜的“自主”政策，是轻飘飘毫无份量的。在台北的中国人民爆发反美大示威之后，美国国内要求改变亚洲政策的呼声也在日益增高。在这种情况下，岸信介的这种继续追随美国政策的作法是否得计，那就很值得怀疑了。
  岸信介这次到东南亚五国访问，还同各国领导人员就亚洲开发基金问题进行了商谈。所谓亚洲开发基金，除了成员国分摊的部分外，主要的来源是美国的“援助”。这就是日本统治集团一向向往的“美国资金、日本技术、东南亚资源”的开发计划的又一说法。但这一计划却没有得到一致的支持。对于日本充当为“美援”鸣锣喝道的马前卒，东南亚国家是抱有戒心的。而美国能够无条件地拿出一笔资金也是困难的。缅甸对于“带有套索”的“援助”表示拒绝；印度的尼赫鲁总理则说：“亚洲需要经济援助，但同军事援助缠到一块，就会产生新问题”；巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底赞成加强同日本在投资方面的双边关系，而不赞成设立开发基金；锡兰的官员们对这笔基金也表示不感兴趣。所以日本金融界人士对于岸信介的这次东南亚之行，也只能作出这样的估计，即认为“具体成果虽少，但打开了继续深入接触的门路，意义是很大的”了。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼评岸信介这次东南亚之行说：岸信介按照不同的国家采取不同的立场，这是比“看风使舵外交”还要恶劣的“吉卜赛外交”。可以说，这道破了岸信介一向玩弄的所谓“两岸主义”的两面三刀的手法。岸信介用这种态度，是否能取信于亚洲各国，使日本在亚洲发挥积极作用，是值得怀疑的。岸信介在这次东南亚之行中所表现出来的“自主”色彩甚少，而追随美国的色彩甚浓，以这种“软骨症”姿态去美国谈判，究竟能把目前不平等的日美关系“调整”成什么样子，是同样值得怀疑的。
