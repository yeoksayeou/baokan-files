　　A Play Within a Play
　　——Watching the Yue Opera "The Chasing Fish"
　　Lan Yi
    The Yue Opera "The Chasing Fish," performed by the Wuhan Yue Opera Troupe, tells the story of the tribulations encountered by a carp spirit and the scholar Zhang Zhen in their love life, and the carp spirit's determination to abandon her thousand years of cultivation and be exiled to the human world.

    This play is not only moving because of the legendary content of the love between a fish and a human, but also because the author's novel use of a contrasting technique of the illusory and the real creates a play within a play, with distinct layers, rising and falling climaxes, and great appeal. For example, the scenes "Trouble in the Mansion" and "Judgement" are presented through the confrontation of the real and fake Peonies and the joint trial of the real and fake Bao Gong. The carp spirit, transformed into a fake Peony, is mistakenly identified by the Jin family as their daughter and taken back to the mansion, causing a quarrel between the two Peonies; subsequently, Jin Chong invites Bao Gong to judge the case, and the carp spirit also invites a fake Bao Gong to accompany her. Throughout the development of the plot, a tense situation arises with one wave not yet settled and another rising. In the end, the play's unfolding and conclusion are natural, seamless, and full of drama, thanks to the fake Bao Gong's sarcastic remarks and the real Bao Gong's gradual clarification of "the mystery within."

    Many scenes in this play provide actors with favorable conditions to showcase their performance skills: the "Watching the Lanterns" scene is entirely suitable for dance movements; the three plucking of the golden scales in the "Chasing the Fish" scene is a test of the actor's posture and skills; and there are many other places in other scenes suitable for actors to "act."

    In terms of performance, Jin Ya Lou, who plays the carp spirit, Xiao Lingfeng, who plays Jin Chong, and Xiao Xianglin, who plays the real Bao Gong, all have unique aspects to their performances. Jin Ya Lou has always been known in Wuhan for playing refined young men, but this time, she successfully reversed roles to play the female role of the carp spirit, demonstrating the breadth of her acting range. In her performance, she is good at combining physical movements with inner activities; in the "Trouble in the Mansion" scene, her expression is extremely complex, and every flick of her sleeve and step forward maintains a mood that is both worried and triumphant, and able to adapt to changing circumstances. These achievements are difficult to achieve without a deep exploration of the character's personality.

    One shortcoming of this play is that the tragic atmosphere of the last four scenes is not consistent with the comedic form of the first six scenes; it is not clear enough what the carp spirit and Zhang Zhen thought of the relationship between the real Peony and Zhang Zhen before they met; if it could be expressed that she had already seen through the Jin family's snobbery and love of wealth, she decided to reveal her love to Zhang Zhen, it would be more consistent with her kind and upright character.

　　戏中有戏
　　——看越剧“追鱼”
　　蓝宜
    武汉市越剧团演出的“追鱼”，是叙述鲤鱼精和书生张珍在爱情生活中遭遇到的波折及鲤鱼精决心丢弃千年道行谪居人间的故事。
    这个戏不仅由于鱼人相恋的传奇内容打动人心，而且也由于作者别开生面地运用了一虚一实互相对衬的手法使得戏中有戏，层次分明，高潮起伏而具有很大的吸引力。例如“闹府”和“剖断”两场，就是通过真、假牡丹的对质和真、假包公的同堂问案来表现的。鲤鱼精幻作假牡丹后，被金家误认为自己的女儿追捉回府，引起了两个牡丹的争吵；随后金宠请了包公来断案，鲤鱼精也请了假包公陪同。在整个剧情的发展中造成一波未平，一波又起的紧张局面。而最后也是采取了假包公冷嘲热讽，真包公逐步明确“此中奥妙”的办法，使得戏的铺开和收束自然、熨贴，富有戏剧性。
    这个戏的很多场次都为演员提供了发挥表演技艺的有利条件：“观灯”一场，全部适合于舞蹈动作；“追鱼”一场的三摘金鳞，更是考验演员身段、功夫的所在；其它各场也还有很多地方适合于演员做“戏”。
    在演出上，饰鲤鱼精的金雅楼、饰金宠的筱灵凤和饰真包公的筱湘麟表演都有独到之处。金雅楼在武汉一向以饰演风雅小生著称，这次反串花旦鲤鱼精，竟能得心应手，说明她的戏路是宽广的。她在表演中善于把形体动作和内心活动结合在一起；“闹府”一场，她的表情极为复杂，一甩袖、一起步都保持着既耽心又得意、并且随机应变的心情。这些不经过对人物性格的深刻探索，是难以做到的。
    这个戏存在的一点缺点是：后四场的悲剧气氛和前六场的喜剧形式不够统一；鲤鱼精和张珍相会之前对于真牡丹和张珍的关系究竟怎样看法，交代得不够清楚；如果能设法表示她早已看透金家的嫌贫爱富才决定对张珍透露爱情，就更加适合于她的善良、正直的性格了。
