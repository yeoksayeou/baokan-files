    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was formally established on June 1st. One hundred and twenty representatives from eleven ethnic groups including Uygur, Kazakh, Daur, Tajik, Tatar, Mongolian, Uzbek, Kirgiz, Xibe, Hui, and Han attended the representative meeting. Musrepov, Chairman of the Writers Association of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, led a Soviet writers delegation and Lao She, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Yan Wenjing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association, came from afar to offer their congratulations. The meeting summarized the achievements and development of literary creation of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region over the past eight years, and believed that under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and literary and artistic guidelines, the literary cause of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has produced many excellent literary works. These works reflect the struggles and the great achievements of building socialism of all ethnic groups from different perspectives. At present, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House and the Youth Publishing House have published more than twenty kinds of literary anthologies of the Uygur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Kirgiz ethnic groups. During the discussion of the literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the writer representatives criticized the bureaucracy and sectarianism of the leading departments of the Autonomous Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the editing of literary and artistic publications. Everyone believed that the literary and artistic publications run by the Autonomous Region could not meet everyone's requirements, and it was necessary to open up more "contending" and "blooming" gardens for literary and artistic workers.

    中国作家协会新疆分会成立
    本报乌鲁木齐3日电　中国作家协会新疆维吾尔自治区分会于6月1日正式成立。出席这次代表会议的，有维吾尔、哈萨克、达呼尔、塔吉克、塔塔尔、蒙古、乌孜别克、柯尔克孜、锡伯、回、汉等十一个民族的代表一百二十人。苏联哈萨克加盟共和国作家协会主席穆斯热波夫率领的苏联作家代表团和中国作家协会副主席老舍、中国作家协会书记处书记严文井都远道前来祝贺。会议总结八年来自治区各民族文学创作的成就和发展，认为：在党和毛主席的民族政策和文艺方针的指导下，新疆各民族的文学事业，涌现出不少优秀的文学作品。这些作品从各个不同的角度反映出各民族的斗争生活和建设社会主义的丰功伟绩。现在新疆的人民、青年两出版社共出版维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜等民族的文学选集达二十多种。会议在讨论“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文艺方针时，作家代表对自治区文联领导部门的官僚主义、宗派主义和文艺刊物的编辑都提出了批评。大家认为，自治区所办的文艺刊物还不能满足大家的要求，需要为文艺工作者多开辟些“鸣”“放”的园地。
