　　The Compass and Other Things
　　Lǐ Gēng
　　Compass
　　The compass is indispensable in the vast sea and sky, indispensable on long journeys, and even more indispensable in places where there are no roads. ... The compass always points to the correct direction, and there will never be lost people beside the compass's pointer.

　　Your beating soul and emotions! Are they guided by a compass? Without looking, how many people have fallen into the abyss of sin, how many people's souls have been stained with indelible filth; how many people's emotions! Are wandering at the crossroads of confusion. ...

　　Compass, why can't it be mastered by everyone?

　　Running
　　When the fleeting years are urging you, when urgent wishes are yearning for the lofty summit; when the footsteps of many people are sounding ahead of you. ... At this time, you!

　　You! Hey! You can run.

　　Who wants to stagnate? Unless you are a paralyzed person. Who wants to repeat jumping on the inherent footprints, unless you are already drunk, or, are willing to eke out a living in shameful years; otherwise, you can run.

　　Run! Like a fighting steed, across time, across barriers, across the road paved for you by predecessors. Run! Towards the goal.

　　Mirror
　　Mirror, this faithful and sincere friend, will never hide your shortcomings for you.

　　When a strand of white hair is added to your temples; when a wrinkle appears on your forehead, or, your eyes lose the brilliance of youth, it can tell you without reservation. Maybe at this time you are bitter, you are regretful, you are disappointed. But you, you can't blame the mirror! It, has once recorded your beauty.

　　We need a mirror that can reflect the soul, but, how much courage does it take to walk in front of the mirror!

　　罗盘及其它

　　罗盘
    罗盘，在渺茫的海空里少不了它，在遥远的旅程中少不了它，在没有路的地方更少不了它。……罗盘，永远针指着一个正确的方向，在罗盘的指针边，永远不会有迷路的人。
    你那跳动的灵魂和感情啊！是不是有着罗盘在指引？不看，多少人曾掉进罪恶的深渊，多少人的灵魂沾染了难以洗涤的污秽；多少人的感情啊！徬徨在迷茫的十字路口。……
    罗盘，为什么又不能为每个人所掌握呢？
    跑步
    当短暂的岁月在催促着你，当急切的心愿在向往着那崇高的顶点；当众多人的步伐响在你的前面。……这时，你呀！
    你呀！嘿！你是会跑步的。
    谁愿意停滞不进呢？除非你是个瘫痪的人。谁愿意重复在固有的脚印上跳跃，除非你已经酩酊大醉，或，甘愿在羞愧的岁月中讨日子；不然，你是会跑步的。
    跑吧！像战斗的烈马，越过时间，越过屏障，越过前人为你铺平的道路。跑吧！朝着目标。
    镜
    镜，这个忠实而又真挚的朋友，永远不会为你隐瞒缺点。
    当你的鬓角增添了一丝白发；当你的额头显露了一条皱纹，或者，你的眼色失去了青春的光彩，它都能不加保留地告诉你。也许这时你苦痛，你懊伤，你失望。但你，却不能责怪镜子啊！它，是曾经记录过你的美丽的。
    我们需要一面能照见灵魂的镜子，但，这却要多少勇气走向镜子的面前啊！
