Liu Mengchun criticized Tan Tiwu's reactionary remarks. He said that before June 8, he had attended two enlarged meetings of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and the atmosphere at the meetings was not normal. At that time, there seemed to be an evil wind in the meeting place, as if the more the Party (not the Party members) was criticized thoroughly, the more it did not conform to the facts, and the more the status quo was described as utterly dark, the more pleasant it became; and some individuals felt more satisfied when listening to such words. What kind of thoughts and feelings are these? He believes this is something that deserves deep vigilance.
He said that Tan Tiwu's speech was full of poison. Tan Tiwu repeatedly said that she was "loyal to the Party," but she advocated that the Party should not directly command Party members working in administrative departments, that the various departments of the Party Central Committee should belong to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and that the Party should conduct leadership through Party members participating in government work, etc. Liu Mengchun said that according to Tan Tiwu's opinion, the Communist Party would only be left with an empty shell, and the Party could only become an abstract thing. As for the government, Tan Tiwu said it nicely that the Party could lead it, but she also opposed the Party commanding Party members in government departments. How can this be leadership? No matter how convoluted her words are, the real purpose is very obvious: in a word, to abolish the leadership of the Party! In addition, Tan Tiwu also slandered the Party for "opposing the Constitution" and "making trouble for itself," and also advocated that the Party should not issue internal instructions in addition to government laws and decrees. Liu Mengchun said that even issuing internal instructions by a leading party has become illegal! Tan Tiwu also opposed the judiciary, lawyers, and procuratorate being led by one Party committee. Liu Mengchun asked: If one Party committee is not good at leading, does it need to be divided into several Party committees to lead? Then what about the Central Committee? The State Council has dozens of ministries and commissions. Should it be divided into dozens of Central Committees to lead? Otherwise, will it lose its "leverage" effect? This is equivalent to not wanting a unified Party committee in the local area, and the Central Committee can also be dispensed with. What an absurd idea!
The meeting also read telegrams from local RCCK organizations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Gansu, Anhui, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangdong and other places. The RCCK organizations in these places expressed their support for the RCCK Central Committee's criticism of right-wing elements such as Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu, and expressed their support for the RCCK's launch of the rectification movement.

    有些人越把党说成漆黑一团
    有的人就听得越痛快越过瘾
    刘孟纯提出质问：这究竟是一种什么思想感情？
    刘孟纯批判了谭惕吾的反动言论。他说，6月8日以前，他曾参加过两次民革中央小组扩大会议，会场空气是不够正常的。当时会场上仿佛有一股歪风，好像越是把党（不是党员）批评得体无完肤，越不符合事实，越把现状说成漆黑一团，就越痛快；也还有个别人听这种话才觉得过瘾。这是一种什么思想感情？他认为这是值得深深警惕的。
    他说，谭惕吾的发言充满了毒素。谭惕吾口口声声说“对党忠心耿耿”，但她主张党不要直接指挥在行政部门工作的党员，党中央的各部应当归到人大常委会去，党要通过党员参加政府工作去进行领导，等等。刘孟纯说，照谭惕吾的意见，共产党只能留下一个空壳，党只能变成一个抽象的东西。而政府呢，谭惕吾说得好听，党可以领导，但她又反对党指挥在政府部门的党员，试问这怎么领导法呢？不管她说的话怎样曲折，真正的目的是很明显的，一句话就是要取消党的领导！此外，谭惕吾还诋毁党“反宪法”，“自己捣自己的乱”，还主张除了政府的法律、法令之外，党不应该发内部指示。刘孟纯说，一个领导党连发内部指示也变成不合
  “法”的了！谭惕吾也曾反对司法、律师、检察三者受一个党委的领导。刘孟纯问道：一个党委不好领导，是不是要分开几个党委领导呢？那么中央又怎么办？国务院有几十个部委，是不是要分几十个中央来领导呢？否则是不是就会失去“杠杆”作用呢？这等于地方不要一个统一的党委，中央也可以不要了。这是多么荒谬的想法！
    会上还宣读了上海、天津、江苏、甘肃、安徽、辽宁、黑龙江、江西、湖北、广东等地民革地方组织拍来的电报，这些地方的民革组织表示拥护民革中央对龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾等右派分子的批判，并表示拥护民革开始整风运动。
