Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 11th: The Italian Zoli Cabinet, which had only been in office for twenty-two days, submitted its resignation to the President on the evening of the 10th.

　　Zoli's resignation was due to the turmoil that occurred during the confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies on the 7th. An error occurred in the counting of votes this time, and the result of the recount showed that although Zoli still won with 305 votes against 257 (nine abstentions), the government was entirely dependent on the 24 votes of the neo-fascist party to obtain the statutory majority of 282 votes. Because many members of his own Christian Democratic Party feared that relying on the support of far-right parties would cause the party to be spurned by voters in next year's general election, Zoli had stated that he was unwilling to consider the support of the neo-fascist party. But at the same time, he gladly accepted the support of another far-right party, the National Monarchist Party.

　　Zoli said at an emergency cabinet meeting on the evening of the 10th that the result of the confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies "cannot be understood as support for the government's political line and program." According to the Rome "Il Messaggero" newspaper, among the 19 ministers in Zoli's all-Christian Democratic cabinet, eight ministers, including Foreign Minister Pella, requested Zoli and his cabinet to resign.

　　President Gronchi has not yet made a decision on whether to accept Zoli's resignation, and he has asked the Zoli government to continue in office temporarily to handle "day-to-day affairs." Sources say that the President will begin consultations with party leaders on the 11th to try to find a successor to Zoli.

### 意大利极右翼政党难做靠山  佐利内阁上台未满月就辞职

　　意大利极右翼政党难做靠山
　　佐利内阁上台未满月就辞职
    据新华社11日讯  罗马消息：就职才二十二天的意大利佐利内阁10日晚上向总统提出了辞呈。
    佐利辞职是由于下议院7日的信任投票中发生的纠葛。这次的票数计算发生错误，重新点票的结果表明，虽然佐利仍然以三百零五票对二百五十七票（九票弃权）获得胜利，但是政府是完全依靠新法西斯党的二十四票才取得法定的二百八十二票多数的；由于他自己的天主教民主党中有许多人害怕依靠极右翼政党的支持会使这个党在明年大选中受到选民唾弃，佐利曾经表示，他不愿意把新法西斯党的支持票数考虑在内。但在同时他欣然接受另一个极右翼政党国家保皇党的支持。
    佐利在10日晚上的内阁紧急会议上说，下院信任投票的结果“不能理解为对政府政治路线和计划的支持”。据罗马“报信者报”消息，在佐利的清一色天主教民主党内阁的十九个部长中，包括外交部长贝拉在内的八个部长要求佐利和他的内阁辞职。
    格隆基总统对于是否接受佐利的辞呈问题还没有作出决定，他要求佐利政府暂时仍继续执政，以处理“日常事务”。消息说，总统将在11日开始同政党领袖会商，以便设法寻找佐利的继任人。
