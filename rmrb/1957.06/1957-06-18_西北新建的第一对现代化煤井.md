Northwest's First Newly Built Modern Coal Mines

The first newly built modern coal mines in the Northwest region – the Sanlidong vertical shafts of the Tongchuan Coal Mine – began trial production in May. The trial production work is now proceeding intensely day and night. At night, spotlights illuminate the ground industrial square of the vertical shafts exceptionally brightly. Cream-colored lights shine through the windows of the towering ore dressing building, and the machines in the winding engine room beside the shaft roar. Strings of coal hopper cars move slowly on the small tracks. Below the mine, electric drills are engaged in a tenacious battle with the coal seam, extracting more than one hundred tons of coal from here every day and night.

Construction of the Sanlidong vertical shafts began in August 1954, and they are built on the Weibei coalfield, which contains 5 billion tons of coal reserves. According to the design, these vertical shafts can mine 600,000 tons of coal annually.

Now, the railway branch line from Xianyang on the Longhai Railway to the Tongchuan mining area has been laid all the way to the coal preparation building of the vertical shafts. There are ten parallel "coal discharge hoppers" at the bottom of the thirty-meter-high coal preparation building; during formal production, the coal will be dumped into the carriages from here. The electric locomotives responsible for underground transportation are test-running on the new tracks. The high-voltage power lines extending from Xi'an across the mountains and rivers to the mining area have been erected all the way to the substation opposite the Sanlidong vertical shafts. More than a thousand new miners in the coal mines, wearing safety wicker hats, are coming and going on the newly opened roads. These circumstances indicate that the day when these vertical shafts officially begin mining is not far off.

### 西北新建的第一对现代化煤井

　　西北新建的第一对现代化煤井
    西北地区新建的第一对现代化煤井——铜川煤矿三里洞竖井，已经在5月间开始试生产。现在试生产的工作正在日夜紧张进行。夜晚，聚光灯把竖井的地面工业广场照得分外明亮。高耸的选矿楼的窗里透出奶油色的灯光，井筒旁绞车房里的机器发出隆隆的吼声。煤斗车成串地在小轨道上蠕蠕行动。在矿井下面，电钻正在向煤层展开顽强的搏斗，每昼夜从这里开采出来的煤炭有一百多吨。
    三里洞竖井是在1954年8月开始施工的，它建在藏煤五十亿吨的渭北煤田上。按照设计，这对竖井每年可以采煤六十万吨。
    现在，从陇海铁路上的咸阳通到铜川矿区的铁路支线，一直铺到竖井的选煤楼下。三十来公尺高的选煤楼下有十个并排着的
  “吐煤斗”；正式生产时，煤就是从这里倾倒进车厢的。担任井下运输的电机车正在新轨道上试行车。从西安翻山跨水伸向矿区的高压电线，一直架到三里洞竖井对岸的变电站上。一千多名新矿井的采煤工人，已戴着安全柳条帽往来在新开的马路上。这些情况预示，这对竖井离正式开始采煤的日子已经不远了。
