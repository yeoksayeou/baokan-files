　　The Quality of Newsreel Films Needs to be Improved
　　I.
　　I am an ordinary moviegoer and an amateur film projectionist. After reading the report in the People's Daily, "Newsreel Films Are Not Valued by Society," I feel that in addition to the various reasons mentioned by Comrade Xu Xiaobing, the poor quality of newsreel films is also a significant factor. In my impression, newsreels reporting on meetings always consist of: representatives arriving in Beijing, a full view of the venue, representatives speaking, resolutions being passed, and flowers and flags being presented. The annual "May Day" and "October 1st" documentaries rarely have any unique characteristics. Films reflecting industrial construction mostly show machines but not people. It is not an exaggeration to label these films as "stereotyped" and "formulaic." Of course, audiences do not welcome such films. Therefore, I hope that in addition to paying attention to newsreel films in terms of distribution and screening, newsreel filmmakers should also strive to improve the quality of the films.

　　The People's Daily published a report on June 6th on page 7, "Newsreel Films Are Not Valued by Society." It mentioned problems in the publicity work of newsreels. I feel that the film studios themselves also bear some responsibility for this issue. Generally, feature film studios can provide some promotional materials to distribution and screening units during the film production process to help them do pre-release publicity and expand social impact. However, the supply of promotional materials from newsreel film studios is often not timely. News cinemas in Xi'an, Chongqing, and other places have to copy the words and phrases from newsreel advertisements published in newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for their publicity because they cannot get promotional materials in advance. Moreover, the production plans for newsreel films also change relatively frequently, and some films are completed in a rush. These films are often only seen by the screening and distribution units one or two days before their official release. For example, the "Moving Mountains and Filling Seas" produced by the August First Film Studio was only seen by movie theaters in Beijing on the afternoon before the film was released. With such a tight schedule, it is difficult to do publicity work.

### 新闻纪录影片的质量要提高

　　新闻纪录影片的质量要提高
　　一
    我是一个普通的电影观众，也是一个业余电影放映员。看了人民日报上登载的“新闻纪录影片不受社会重视”的报道后，我觉得除了徐肖冰同志谈到的种种原因外，新闻纪录影片质量不高，也是相当重要的一个原因。在我的印象里，报道会议情况的新闻片，总是：代表到京，会场全景，代表发言，通过决议，献花献旗。一年一度的“五一”、“十一”的纪录片很少特点。反映工业建设的影片大都只看见机器而看不到人。替这些影片加上“千篇一律”、“公式化”的帽子是不算过分的。这样的影片当然观众不欢迎了。因此我希望除了发行放映等方面重视新闻纪录片外，新闻纪录片工作者也应努力提高影片质量。

    人民日报6月6日第七版上发表了“新闻纪录影片不受社会重视”的报道，其中提到新闻纪录片的宣传工作中的问题，我觉得在这个问题上制片厂本身也负有一定责任。一般故事片厂在影片摄制过程中，就可以供给发行、放映单位一些宣传材料，供发行、放映单位做好影片的预告宣传，扩大社会影响；然而新闻纪录电影制片厂的宣传材料的供应常常是不及时的。远在西安、重庆等地的新闻电影院，由于事先得不到宣传材料，不得不抄录北京、天津等地报纸上刊载的新闻纪录片的广告中的词句来做宣传。而且新闻纪录影片的摄制计划变动也比较大，有些影片是突击完成的，这些影片常常是在正式公映前一两天放映、发行单位才能看到。如八一制片厂出品的“移山填海”，北京市各电影院就是在影片上映前一天的下午才看到的。时间这样仓促，做宣传工作也就感到困难了。
