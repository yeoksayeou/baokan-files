Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 2nd. The editorial department of the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "For Socialism, Friendship, and Peace," commemorating the second anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration in Belgrade.

The article pointed out that the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration ended the period in which good relations between the two countries were damaged, opened up broad possibilities for the fundamental improvement and comprehensive development of relations between the two countries, and also promoted the improvement and normalization of relations between the people's democratic countries and Yugoslavia. The complete normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is of great significance for consolidating the cause of peace and for the international workers' movement.

The article believes that the past discord in Soviet-Yugoslav relations could only benefit the imperialist forces. The enemies of socialism and peace tried their best to deepen the disputes between the two countries, and the Belgrade Declaration dealt a fatal blow to this plan of the imperialist reactionaries.

The "Pravda" article pointed out that the fundamental interests of the Soviet and Yugoslav people require further strengthening of friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries. The necessary objective conditions for such cooperation now exist. The long-standing traditional friendship between the two peoples has been strengthened in the common struggle against fascism. The people of the two countries are united by the traditions of the common revolutionary communist movement, by the common interests of building socialism, and by the common desire to strive for peace in Europe and the world. "Pravda" said that the Soviet Union has always adhered to the spirit of the Belgrade Declaration and the documents signed in Moscow, and has expanded political, economic, cultural, scientific, sports, and other ties with Yugoslavia. However, it would be incorrect not to mention the current difficulties in the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. These difficulties mainly belong to ideological issues. However, the differences in views on certain ideological issues between the two countries cannot hinder the comprehensive development of cooperation between the two countries. The Soviet Union advocates developing, deepening, and expanding this cooperation, and also advocates strengthening Yugoslavia's friendship with other socialist countries.

The article quoted a passage from Khrushchev's speech at the reception held by the Albanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union on April 15 regarding strengthening friendship with Yugoslavia. In that speech, Khrushchev said that we should not focus primarily on emphasizing the differences in our views on certain issues, but on the fact that our people are drawing closer to each other in the struggle for socialism and peace. The article said that, naturally, in order to strengthen our friendship, the Yugoslav comrades must also show a willingness to further improve mutual relations with the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp. The article then quoted Tito's recent speech in Macedonia, in which he talked about how Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries should work harder to find the factors that can unite them and gradually eliminate the factors that separate them.

When talking about cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in foreign policy, "Pravda" welcomed the support of the Yugoslav government and people for the proposals to reduce and limit armaments. The article also mentioned that the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia support the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration believes that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan should be safeguarded, and the socialist countries fully support the Bandung Conference resolutions.

The "Pravda" article pointed out that Soviet-Yugoslav friendship can and should be developed on the basis of loyalty to the great cause of Marxism-Leninism, and should be filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Following this path, there is no doubt that all obstacles to the true prosperity of the fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia can be eliminated. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government are making great efforts to improve relations between the two countries and the two parties. There is no doubt that Yugoslavia has every possibility to contribute to further strengthening the friendly relations between socialist countries. The attempts of the imperialists to divide, weaken, and undermine the solidarity of socialist countries will continue to fail.

"Pravda" concluded by saying that the Soviet people extend warm and friendly congratulations to the fraternal Yugoslav people and sincerely hope that they will achieve success in the construction of a socialist society.

    为了社会主义、为了友谊与和平
    “真理报”编辑部发表文章纪念苏南宣言签字两周年
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联“真理报”编辑部今天发表了以“为了社会主义、为了友谊与和平”为题的编辑部文章，纪念苏南宣言在贝尔格莱德签字两周年。
    文章指出，苏南宣言结束了两国间良好关系受到破坏的时期，为两国关系的根本改善和全面发展开辟了广泛的可能性，同时也促进了人民民主国家同南斯拉夫的关系的改善和正常化。苏南关系的完全正常化对巩固和平事业以及对国际工人运动也有着巨大的意义。
    文章认为，苏南两国关系中曾经有过的不和只能有利于帝国主义势力。社会主义和和平的敌人尽力想加深两国间的争执，贝尔格莱德宣言给帝国主义反动派这种计划以致命的打击。
    “真理报”的文章指出，苏南两国人民的根本利益要求进一步加强两国间的友谊和兄弟合作。现在具备着这种合作的必要的客观条件。两国人民悠久的传统友谊在反法西斯的共同斗争中得到了加强。两国人民被共同的革命共产主义运动的传统、被建设社会主义的共同利益和争取欧洲和世界和平的共同愿望团结在一起。“真理报”说，苏联始终信守贝尔格莱德宣言和在莫斯科签署的文件的精神同南斯拉夫扩大着政治、经济、文化科学、体育等方面的联系。但是如果不提到苏南两国相互关系中目前存在的困难，也是不正确的。这些困难主要属于思想方面的问题。但是两国对若干思想方面的问题在看法上存在分歧并不能阻碍两国发展全面的合作。苏联主张发展、加深和扩大这种合作，也主张加强南斯拉夫同其他社会主义国家的友谊。
    文章引用了赫鲁晓夫4月15日在阿尔巴尼亚驻苏联大使馆招待会上的讲话中关于加强同南斯拉夫的友谊的一段话，赫鲁晓夫在那段讲话中说，不应当把主要注意力放在强调我们在某些问题上观点的分歧上面，而应当放在我们的人民在为社会主义和和平事业而斗争中互相接近的上面。文章说，自然，为了加强我们的友谊，南斯拉夫同志还必须表现出对进一步改善同苏联和社会主义阵营各国相互关系的愿望。文章接着又引用了铁托不久以前在马其顿的讲话，他在讲话中谈到南斯拉夫同苏联和其他社会主义国家应当更加努力地去找寻那些可以使彼此团结在一起的因素，逐步消除使彼此分离的因素。
    “真理报”在谈到苏南两国在外交政策方面的合作时表示欢迎南斯拉夫政府和人民支持裁减、限制军备的建议。文章还谈到苏南两国支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，苏南宣言认为应当维护中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利，以及社会主义各国完全支持万隆会议的决议。
    “真理报”的文章指出，苏南友谊可能而且应当在忠于马克思列宁主义伟大事业的基础上得到发展，应当充满无产阶级国际主义精神。遵循这条道路前进，毫无疑问，苏南两国兄弟友谊真正繁荣的一切障碍都可能消除。苏联共产党和政府正在作巨大的努力来改进两国和两国的党之间的关系。毫无疑问，南斯拉夫有一切可能对进一步加强社会主义各国之间的友好关系作出贡献。帝国主义者分裂、削弱和破坏社会主义国家团结的企图，今后也还是要破产。
    “真理报”最后表示，苏联人民向兄弟的南斯拉夫人民致以热烈的、友好的祝贺。并且衷心地希望他们在社会主义社会的建设中取得成就。
