　　Combining National Interests with Farmers' Interests
    Jilin Province Sends a Large Number of Cadres to Resolve Rural Conflicts

　　Changchun, June 24th (report from our correspondent Tang Baoshun) After more than 4,000 cadres in Jilin Province were sent to counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives, and more than 1,300 township cadres returned to the cooperatives to participate in production, the subjectivism and coercive commandism in rural work have been greatly reduced.
    These dispatched cadres can generally live, eat, and work with the farmers, and they also consult with the masses when it comes to work. For example, this year, when various counties formulated agricultural production plans and promoted agricultural production increase experiences, they fundamentally changed the past method of "leaders deciding and issuing instructions at all levels," and instead adopted a bottom-up democratic discussion and joint consultation approach. For example, farmers in Panshi, Hailong, and other counties only wanted to grow rice, but were unwilling to plant soybeans and other cash crops that the country urgently needed. After repeated publicity by the cadres and organization of discussions among the cooperative members, the result was that both the needs of the country were guaranteed and the requirements of the farmers were taken care of.
    In order to comprehensively develop the rural economy and overcome the past bias in rural work of restricting the working hours of cooperative members too rigidly and ignoring the income of cooperative members' household sideline occupations, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward six measures to correctly handle the collective and individual interests. For example, without affecting collective production, cooperative members are allowed to raise a limited number of small livestock (such as cattle, sheep, donkeys, etc.) in their households, and small plots of wasteland can also be reclaimed in areas where conditions permit, in order to increase the source of feed; it is also emphasized to clearly define the scope of collective and household sideline production and operation and to make good plans for collective and individual working hours. After the implementation of these measures, the rural economy has generally become more active. For example, more than 7,000 cooperative member households in Baicheng Prefecture bought more than 3,300 donkeys, 1,300 sheep, 500 cattle, and 700 mules and horses. Mongolian cooperative members also bought more than 700 dairy cows and 50 hunting horses according to their living habits. This not only solved the problem of where to invest funds for farmers in Baicheng Prefecture after the bumper harvest, expanded investment in reproduction, but also reversed the phenomenon that livestock prices fell sharply and live cattle were not as valuable as dead cattle.
    Due to the development of livestock and the fact that cooperative members had time for household labor, the area of abandoned land was also reduced and the feed base was increased, and the income of cooperative members' household sideline occupations increased significantly. For example, in Kaitong County, without affecting spring plowing production, the income of cooperative members' household sideline occupations reached more than 247,000 yuan; in Jiaohe County, the average household income from household sideline occupations last winter and this spring reached more than 90 yuan. This solved the difficulties in production and life of farmers in disaster areas this year, and also reduced the investment in national agricultural loans.
    Although Jilin Province has achieved gains in handling internal contradictions among the people in rural areas, there are still problems. For example, some cooperative members did not act in accordance with the regulations, and took too much care of their personal interests, which affected collective production. According to an understanding in mid-June, more than 30,000 hectares of paddy and dry land in the province have not been planted due to lack of rain, which has further increased the burden of summer hoeing work. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a special meeting of rural work department heads of various counties to study how to correctly handle these newly emerging problems in rural areas, in order to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

### 把国家利益和农民利益结合起来  吉林省下放大批干部解决农村矛盾

　　把国家利益和农民利益结合起来
    吉林省下放大批干部解决农村矛盾
　　本报长春24日电　记者汤宝顺报道：吉林省四千多名干部下派到县、区、乡和农业社，一千三百多名乡干部回社参加生产以后，农村工作中的主观主义和强迫命令作风，大大减少了。
    这些下放干部，一般都能和农民同住同吃同劳动，在工作上也做到了有事和群众商量。像今年各县在制定农业生产计划和推广农业增产经验时，根本改变了过去“领导决定，层层下达”的方法，而是采取自下而上的民主讨论，共同协商。例如磐石、海龙等县农民只愿多种水稻，而不愿种植国家迫切需要的大豆等经济作物，经过干部反复宣传和组织社员讨论，结果既保证了国家需要，也照顾了农民的要求。
    为全面发展农村经济，克服过去农村工作中的对社员劳动时间限制过死，忽视社员家庭副业收入的偏向，中共吉林省委提出了正确处理集体与个人利益的六项措施。如，在不影响集体生产的情况下，有限量的允许社员家庭饲养小牲畜（如牛、羊、驴等），有条件地区也可以开垦小片荒地，以增加饲料来源；并强调划清集体与家庭副业生产经营范围和做好集体与个人劳动时间的规划。这些措施贯彻执行以后，农村经济普遍活跃起来。如白城专区有七千多户社员买进三千三百多头驴、一千三百多只羊、五百多头牛和七百多匹骡马。蒙古族社员根据生活习惯，还买进了七百多头奶牛和五十多匹猎马。这不仅解决了丰收后白城专区农民的资金出路问题，扩大了再生产投资，也扭转了牲畜价猛跌、活牛不如死牛值钱的现象。
    由于牲畜的发展，和社员有了家务劳动时间，也减少了撂荒地的面积，增加了饲料基地，社员的家庭副业收入显著增加了。例如开通县在不影响春耕生产的情况下，社员家庭副业收入达二十四万七千多元；蛟河县去冬今春的家庭副业收入，全县每户平均达到九十多元。这样解决了灾区农民今年生产、生活中的困难，也减少了国家农业贷款的投资。
    吉林省处理农村人民内部矛盾虽然有了收获，但还有问题。例如，有些社员没有按规定办事，过多地照顾了个人的利益，影响了集体生产。据6月中旬了解，全省仍有三万多公顷水旱田因缺雨没种上，这就更加重了夏锄工作的繁忙。中共吉林省委最近专门召开了各县农村工作部长会议，研究正确处理农村中新产生的这些问题，以便争取今年农业生产大丰收。
