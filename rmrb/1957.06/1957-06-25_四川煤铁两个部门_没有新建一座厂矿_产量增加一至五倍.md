Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th - The coal and iron sectors within Sichuan Province's local industry, despite not having a single new factory or mine built during the First Five-Year Plan, had respectively reached 109.22% and 114.91% of the not-so-low targets of Sichuan Province's First Five-Year Plan by the end of May this year.

　　Coal production increased by about one and a half times compared to 1952; iron increased by about five times.

　　The approximately ten million yuan invested by the state in these two industries was all used to improve existing equipment: adding some iron smelting blast furnaces and expanding production scale, etc.

　　Before 1952, Sichuan Province's coal mines rarely had mechanical ventilation equipment; there were few dormitories for workers, who often took turns sleeping in the same room in three shifts; the underground transportation equipment was also very rudimentary. In the course of implementing the Five-Year Plan, state investment changed the above situation.

　　The promotion of advanced experience played an important role in improving productivity. Taking the Weiyuan Iron Mine as an example: before 1953, blast furnaces of the same volume produced more than 20 tons of iron per day; after promoting the advanced Soviet all-wind operation experience, the daily output has now reached 56 tons.

　　The Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry has decided that during the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to building new coal and iron factories and mines, it will continue to tap the production potential of existing factories and mines.

### 四川煤铁两个部门  没有新建一座厂矿　产量增加一至五倍

　　四川煤铁两个部门
    没有新建一座厂矿　产量增加一至五倍
    新华社成都24日电　四川省属于地方工业中的煤铁两个部门，在第一个五年计划期间没有新建一座厂矿，但到今年5月底止，他们分别达到了定额并不太低的四川省第一个五年计划指标的109.22％和114.91％。
    煤的产量比1952年增加约一倍半；铁增加约五倍。
    国家对这两个行业所投的约一千万元资金，都是用在改进旧有设备上：添设了一些炼铁高炉和在生产规模上进行扩充等。
    在1952年以前，四川省属的煤矿很少有机械通风设备；职工宿舍很少，往往在一间房子里三班工人轮流睡觉；井内运输设备也很简陋。在五年计划的执行过程中，国家投资改变了以上的状况。
    推广先进经验对提高生产率起了重要作用。以威远铁矿为例：同样容积的高炉，在1953年以前日产铁二十多吨；推广苏联全风操作先进经验以后，到现在日产量为五十六吨。
    四川省工业厅决定在第二个五年计划期间，同新建煤铁厂矿同时，还将继续挖掘现有厂矿的生产潜力。
