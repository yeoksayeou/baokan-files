Xinhua News Agency, June 8th dispatch from Tunis: French troops clashed again with Tunisian residents and soldiers on the night of June 7th in the port of Gabès, resulting in bloodshed. It is reported that more than ten people were killed and about twenty injured in the conflict.

Tunisian Secretary of State for Information, Ben Ahmed, said that the French were the instigators of this incident. He emphasized that French soldiers, disregarding the Tunisian government's ban on French troop movements, attempted to break through Tunisian checkpoints in military vehicles and opened fire first.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 9th: Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna, in a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the President of the Security Council on June 8th, requested UN member states to support Tunisia in the current conflict between Tunisia and France.

French troops have recently engaged in several conflicts with Tunisian troops as a result of defying the Tunisian government's ban and moving on Tunisian roads.

Hassouna requested that Arab League countries support Tunisia's firm attitude in safeguarding its independence and sovereignty. He suggested that Arab League member states provide Tunisia with financial, political, and moral assistance.
