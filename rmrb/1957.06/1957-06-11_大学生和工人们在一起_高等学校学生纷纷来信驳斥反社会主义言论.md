　　University Students Write Letters Refuting Anti-Socialist Statements

　　(Our Dispatch) In recent days, this newspaper has received a large number of letters from readers denouncing anti-Party and anti-socialist statements. These include many letters from university students.

　　The entire student body of Class 6106 of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics sent an open letter to students across the country, calling on young students nationwide to resolutely struggle against all anti-communist and anti-socialist statements. In their letter, they said: During this rectification campaign, some people with anti-socialist and anti-communist ideas are taking the opportunity to try to push the Communist Party off the stage and overthrow the socialist system, which we cannot allow. Young students across the country should unite, stand firm, withstand the test in the storm, and resolutely follow the Communist Party forward.

　　Students at Renmin University of China, where Ge Peiqi works, have also written to express their opposition to Ge Peiqi's anti-communist and anti-socialist statements. Renmin University student Zheng Zhong wrote: Ge Peiqi said, "The people's living standards have declined," which is obviously a fallacy! My family of five had difficulties before liberation, my mother and sister went out for eleven years, and I worked as a "pig herder" for others. Now, not only is the family reunited and life is better, but I have also become a college student from a pig herding child. Would you say that our living standards have declined or improved? Zhang Shuyu, a student at the Central University for Nationalities, also said in a letter refuting Ge Peiqi's fallacy that her family's life was very difficult in the past, often lacking food and clothing. After liberation, her family's living standards improved, so she had the opportunity to study at university. Her family now has its first college student.

　　The entire third-year class of the school education program at Beijing Normal University wrote that after seeing the recent People's Daily editorial and the speeches of worker comrades, they held a special symposium, and the students fully supported the opinions of the worker comrades. The title of their letter is: "University Students and Workers Together."

　　Students at various universities are particularly angry about the anonymous letters threatening Lu Yuwen. Li Tianmin and Zhang Weixun of the Russian Department of Beijing Normal University wrote: When the Party is launching non-Party members to help the Party with rectification, some people are using such despicable means to carry out political intimidation, which is intolerable. This kind of sneaky behavior makes us wonder what their purpose is?

　　In addition, students from Beijing University, Beijing Russian Language Institute, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Railway Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Normal College, Beijing Forestry College, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing University of Political Science and Law, and universities in Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shenyang and other places have also written to express their opposition to the erroneous statements of Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, Wang Dezhou, and Yang Yuqing.

　　大学生和工人们在一起
　　高等学校学生纷纷来信驳斥反社会主义言论
    本报讯  最近几天内，本报收到大批读者来信，斥责反共产党、反社会主义的言论。其中包括许多高等学校学生的来信。
    北京航空学院6106班全体同学向全国学生写了一封公开信，要求全国青年学生坚决向一切反共、反社会主义的言论进行斗争。他们在信中说：在这次整风运动中，一些具有反对社会主义、反对共产党的思想的人，趁机想推共产党下台，推翻社会主义制度，我们是不能容许的。全国青年学生应当团结起来，站稳立场，在风浪中经得起考验，坚决地跟随共产党前进。
    葛佩琦所在学校的中国人民大学学生，也纷纷来信表示反对葛佩琦的反共、反社会主义言论。人民大学学生郑重来信说：葛佩琦说“老百姓生活水平下降了”，这显然是谬论！我们一家五口人，解放前因为生活困难，母亲和妹妹走出十一年，我给人家当“猪倌”，而如今，不仅家庭团圆了，生活好了，我还从一个放猪的娃娃成了个大学生。你说我们的生活水平是下降了还是提高了？中央民族学院学生张淑玉也在驳斥葛佩琦谬论的来信中说，过去她家生活非常困难，经常少吃缺穿。解放后，她家的生活水平提高了，因此她有了到大学学习的机会。她家就有了第一个大学生。
    北京师范大学学校教育专业三年级全体同学的来信说，他们在看到最近人民日报的社论和工人同志的发言后，特地举行了一个座谈会，同学们完全支持工人同志的意见。他们的来信的题目是：“大学生和工人们在一起”。
    各大学学生对于有人写匿名信恐吓卢郁文的事情尤为愤怒。北京师范大学俄语系学生李天民、张维训等人的来信中说：当着党正在发动党外人士帮助党整风的时候，居然有人使用这种卑鄙的手段来向别人进行政治恐吓，这是十分令人不能容忍的。这种鬼鬼祟祟的勾当，使我们不能不怀疑他们的目的到底是什么？
    此外，北京大学、北京俄语学院、北京地质学院、北京铁道学院、北京工业学院、北京师范学院、北京林学院、北京钢铁学院、北京政法学院等高等学校的学生以及上海、天津、南京、青岛、沈阳等地大学学生也都来信对章乃器、储安平、葛佩琦、王德周、杨玉清等人的错误言论提出了反对的意见。
