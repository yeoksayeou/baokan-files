Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government announced on June 28th its note to the West German government. The note points out that equipping the West German army with atomic weapons and turning West Germany into a base for atomic war in Europe will inflict irreversible damage on the cause of German national reunification.

The note, which Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed to West German Ambassador Haas in the Soviet Union on June 27th, is a reply to the West German government's note of May 22nd of this year.

The Soviet note states that West Germany possessing atomic armaments and becoming an atomic base for the North Atlantic Group will necessitate the Soviet Union and its allies taking countermeasures to safeguard their common security. The Soviet Union has sufficient strength to eliminate aggressors, regardless of where the aggression originates. The note points out that the West German government has stated that it does not produce atomic weapons. This statement would be entirely welcome if the West German government were not to devote itself to importing atomic weapons from abroad to equip its army. However, the West German government does not intend to abandon its plans to arm the West German army with atomic weapons. The purpose of this ambiguous statement by the West German government is merely to deceive West German voters.

The Soviet note points out that the West German government does not approve of the suggestions already made on disarmament that directly concern Germany (establishing arms limitation and inspection zones in Europe, reducing and withdrawing foreign troops from German territory). From this, it can be concluded that the West German government accepts the conditions dictated by the North Atlantic Group and wants to legitimize the atomic weapons equipment of the West German Defense Force. The West German government is, in effect, attempting to appoint itself as an arbitrator among countries negotiating on disarmament issues.

The Soviet note regrettably points out that the West German government considers it impossible to support the suggestion that the three major powers currently possessing atomic weapons—the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom—reach an agreement not to store such weapons on German territory. The Soviet government believes that the implementation of this suggestion would greatly reduce the risk of an atomic war breaking out not only in Germany but throughout the European continent.

The note points out that the West German government's statement that the storage of atomic weapons in West Germany by Western countries is stipulated by the overall military plans of the North Atlantic Group once again confirms that West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Group is contrary to the vital interests of the German people.

Two months ago, the Soviet government issued a note to the West German government on April 27th, warning the West German army not to equip itself with atomic weapons. In its reply on May 22nd, the West German government stated that West Germany cannot "permanently renounce" the "right" to use atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 29th dispatch: Bonn news: A spokesman for the West German government said on June 28th, commenting on the Soviet Union's new note to West Germany, that the West German government "in no case" can offer a general guarantee about not equipping the West German army with atomic weapons.

On the same day, West German Defense Minister Strauss, in a conversation with American reporters, said that the North Atlantic Group's Council of Ministers will make a decision in December regarding the West German army's equipment with tactical atomic warheads. The West German government will make relevant decisions after this meeting.

### 免使德国民族统一受到不可挽回的打击  苏联再正告西德不要装备原子武器

　　免使德国民族统一受到不可挽回的打击
    苏联再正告西德不要装备原子武器
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府6月28日公布了它给西德政府的照会。照会中指出：用原子武器装备西德军队和使西德变成欧洲原子战争的基地，将使德国人民的民族统一事业受到不可挽回的打击。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯6月27日交给西德驻苏大使哈斯的这件照会，是对西德政府今年5月22日照会的复照。
    苏联的照会中说：西德拥有原子军备并且变成北大西洋集团的原子基地，将使苏联及其友邦有必要采取对策以保障它们的共同安全。苏联有足够的力量消灭侵略者，无论侵略行动来自何方。照会指出：西德政府曾经声明不生产原子武器。如果西德政府能不致力于从外国运进原子武器来装备自己军队，这种声明可以完全受到欢迎。然而西德政府并不打算放弃用原子武器武装西德军队的计划。西德政府这种含糊其词的声明的目的只不过是骗慰西德的选民而已。
    苏联照会指出：西德政府不赞成在裁军方面已提出的直接涉及德国的建议（在欧洲建立军备限制和视察区，裁减和撤出德国境内的外国军队）。由此可以得出结论：西德政府接受北大西洋集团授意的条件，并且要使西德国防军的原子武器装备成为合法。西德政府实际上是企图自封为就裁军问题进行谈判的国家的一个仲裁者。
    苏联照会中遗憾地指出，西德政府认为不可能支持这个建议，即目前三个拥有原子武器的大国——苏联、美国和英国就不在德国领土上存放这种武器达成协议。苏联政府认为，实现这一建议不仅在德国而且在整个欧洲大陆上会大大地减少爆发原子战争的危险。
    照会指出，西德政府声明说，西方国家在西德境内存放原子武器是由北大西洋集团总的军事计划所规定的；这再次证实：西德参加北大西洋集团是违反德国人民切身利益的。
    两个月前，苏联政府曾在4月27日对西德政府发出照会，警告西德军队不要装备原子武器。西德政府在5月22日的复照中声明：西德不能“永远放弃”使用原子武器的“权利”。
    据新华社柏林29日电　波恩消息：西德政府发言人6月28日在评论苏联给西德的新照会时说：西德政府“无论如何”不能提出关于不用原子武器装备西德军队的总括性的保证。
    同一天，西德国防部长施特劳斯同美国记者谈话时说，北大西洋集团部长会议将在12月间作出关于西德军队装备战术原子弹头的决定。西德政府将在这个会议以后作出有关的决定。
