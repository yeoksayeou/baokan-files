    Coming North
    Sun Shiyi
    After years of living abroad, I came north in the year of Ding You, and the face of the motherland is new every day.
    Sixty years ago, I was forty years old, Premier Zhou kindly instructed me, and Elder Dong bestowed poetry upon me;
    Old travels are like dreams, new things are like tides, I respectfully follow the original rhyme, and briefly describe my impressions.
    To reply to Elder Dong, and also to present to Elder Guo, and Hong Kong's Zhang Xingyan.
    The royal way now prevails throughout the land, the ambition is superior, unprecedented in ancient times.
    The flowers of contention bloom, startling the world, the wind of correction moves ghosts and gods;
    Private changed to public, neighboring countries envy, diplomacy is stable, good news is frequent;
    A thousand cups are raised to the longevity of the elders, the spring returns to the imperial garden, and the grass and trees flourish.

    ?The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, initiated and promoted by ourselves, followed by open-door rectification and consistent implementation, has never been seen before in the brotherly camp; and has particularly shocked ordinary countries.

    ?To correct mistakes is not only a judicial principle in handling the relationship between ourselves and the enemy, but the entire party rectification movement is in fact another great manifestation of this spirit of correcting mistakes. This time, the eradication of the three evils from the thoughts and work styles of party members, though gentle and painstaking, is also swift and decisive; it not only corrects mistakes, but also promotes truth.

    ?The socialist transformation of China's national bourgeoisie, since the completion of its peaceful transition, has been much discussed by many neighboring countries; and even more happily praised by some nationally independent countries.

    ?The diplomatic situation in the short eight years since the founding of the country can be described as unprecedented: to date, formal diplomatic relations have been established with more than thirty countries; and people's diplomacy is three times this number. As for the wings of culture and trade spreading across the globe, reaching every corner, it goes without saying.

Dong Lao's gift to Sun Shiyi's original work:
Avoiding chaos and living by the Shuizi River, Sun Lang is handsome and stands out from the crowd.
The stage director's thunderous and rainy plays, the anti-Japanese songs move ghosts and gods to tears;
News of his escape from danger has spread in Hong Kong, and only news is hoped for from the Shanghai River;
With a cup in hand, a happy smile, and enjoy the spring of distilled rice wine in the city of Chongqing.

    北来
    孙师毅
    频年外泊，丁酉北来，祖国面貌，日新又新。
    一甲子前，我年四十，总理面贻  董老惠诗；
    旧游似梦，新事如潮，谨步原韵，聊述观感。
    以答　董老，兼呈郭老，暨香港章行严丈。王道而今率土滨，立心优越古无伦。争鸣花发惊寰宇?，纠错风行动鬼神?；私改为公邻国羡?，外交若定捷音频?；千杯齐寿诸元老，上苑阳回草木春。
    ?百花齐放与百家争鸣政策，自我倡行，继以开门整风，坚持贯彻，兄弟阵营，固未前见；一般国家，尤感震惊。
    ?有错必纠，不仅是处理敌我关系上的司法一原则，整个党内整风运动，亦实为此一纠错精神的另一伟大表现。此次从党员思想与作风上根除三害，虽和风细雨，亦雷厉风行；固纠正错误，实发扬真理。
    ?中国民族资产阶级之社会主义改造，自完成其和平过渡过程后，众多邻国，议论纷纭；若干民族独立国家更益以欢喜赞叹。
    ?开国以来短短八年间之外交形势，直可谓旷古空前：迄今正规建交，早逾三十国；人民外交，三倍此数。至文化与贸易之展翅全球、靡远勿届，更无论矣。
    董老赠孙师毅原作避乱栖迟字水滨，孙郎英俊出群伦。舞台导演惊雷雨，抗日高歌泣鬼神；香岛已传人脱险，沪江惟冀讯来频；一杯在手开颜笑，且乐渝城曲米春。
