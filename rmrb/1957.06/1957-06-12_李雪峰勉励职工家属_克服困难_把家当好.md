　　Li Xuefeng Encourages Workers' Families
    Overcome Difficulties and Manage Their Homes Well

    (Our Newspaper) This reporter reports that Li Xuefeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the Industrial Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the National Workers' Family Representatives Conference yesterday afternoon.

    He said that worker's family work in the past had achieved great results: you managed your own household affairs well, educated your children well, and supported and assisted your husbands in their production; you developed household sideline occupations, and did a good job in uniting neighbors; relying on your own strength, you helped families in difficulty to overcome difficulties and reduced the burden on enterprises; especially in order to support the construction of the interior, they encouraged their husbands to settle down and produce at their new jobs.

    Comrade Li Xuefeng said that these achievements were achieved under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party of China—and in the environment of the smooth development of our country's socialist construction. However, in your specific work, there are still many difficulties. For example, the Party and the trade union do not care enough, support enough, or lead enough in family work, and some work is even carried out without support. You overcame one difficulty after another and achieved results, which proves that your enthusiasm and creativity are very high. This is a concrete manifestation of the excellent qualities of the Chinese working class in you.

    Comrade Li Xuefeng said that there are many experiences in family work, the main ones are: First, the people must have the leadership of the Party and must have leaders. Without the backbone elements who mobilize the masses, family work cannot be done well. The backbone elements in worker's family work are part of the worker's families. They must contact the masses, unite the masses, and help and educate the masses; each representative is not only a model for managing the family well, but also a mass worker. To do a good job in mass work, we must also rely on the leadership of the Party. This is not only necessary, but also our bounden duty. Therefore, the Party should accept the opinions of the families; the work of the families should be supported; the demands of the families should be answered as much as possible; second, family work should strengthen unity. We must demand that the family be united and that the neighbors be united. In order to do a good job of unity, the first thing is to be considerate of the husband and understand his thoughts, life and work; on the other hand, we must also understand that we are the real heads of the household in charge of household affairs. At the same time, the Party and the trade union should strengthen the education of workers, so that workers know the importance of housework; third, we must overcome difficulties to move forward. There are many difficulties in family work, manifested in material, life, interpersonal relationships, and ideology. The family backbone elements are all inseparable from production and bear a heavy burden. They must not only manage their own household affairs well, but also do mass work, and sometimes they cannot get the understanding of their husbands; the working objects are also one household after another, which is difficult to work, and at the same time, the work achievements are not easily seen by the general public. These difficulties can be improved and must be improved, and the Party must support it, but it is difficult to change such work all at once. We must sum up experience based on the characteristics of family work and do the work well.

    Then, Comrade Li Xuefeng introduced the current working environment. He said that our country has made great progress and achieved great results in all aspects. This is the result of the hard work of the working class and the people of the whole country. However, there are many difficulties, insufficient family property, low production level, large population, and very poor. To build our country, we must find out the family property and make the difficulties clear to everyone, and mobilize everyone to come up with ways to overcome the difficulties. Your experience in doing family work also proves that as long as you make the difficult situation clear, the masses will be able to overcome the difficulties. You are all housekeepers, you know that it is not easy to manage a family, and it is even more difficult to manage the country. It is not easy to manage, but it must be managed well. The Party Central Committee has decided to carry out a rectification movement within the entire Party to overcome all aspects of shortcomings in our work and manage our family better.

    Finally, Comrade Li Xuefeng answered the representatives' requests: First, we must improve the working environment of families as much as possible and adjust their workload; second, we must restore the practice of family members attending Party classes and political classes; third, the leaders must regularly check family work and require enterprise leaders to take family work as part of their own work and regularly go deep into the dormitories; fourth, we must recruit outstanding members of families into the Party; fifth, in places where worker's representative conferences are promoted, family representatives should be invited to attend as nonvoting delegates.

　　李雪峰勉励职工家属
    克服困难  把家当好
    本报讯  中共中央书记处书记、中共中央工业工作部部长李雪峰同志，昨天下午在全国职工家属代表会议上讲了话。
    他说，过去的职工家属工作取得了很大成绩：你们管好了自己的家务，教养好了子女，支持、帮助了丈夫的生产；开展了家庭副业，作好了团结邻居的工作；依靠自己的力量，帮助困难户克服了困难，减轻了企业的负担；特别是为了支援内地建设，他们鼓励自己的丈夫在新的工作岗位上安心生产。
    李雪峰同志说，这些成绩是在工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党领导下和在我国社会主义建设顺利发展的环境中取得的。但是，在你们的具体的工作仍然有很多困难，例如，党和工会对家属工作关怀不够，支持不够，领导不够，甚至有的工作是在没有支持的情况下进行的。你们克服了一个一个的困难，取得了成绩，这证明你们的积极性、创造性很高。这是中国工人阶级优良品质在你们身上的具体表现。
    李雪峰同志说，家属工作经验很多，主要的有：第一，人民群众必须要有党的领导，要有带头的人。没有带动群众的骨干分子，家属工作是不能作好的。职工家属工作中的骨干分子，是职工家属的一部分，他们必须联系群众，团结群众，帮助和教育群众；每一个代表不单是管好家庭的模范，而且是群众工作者。要作好群众工作，同时要依靠党的领导。这不但是必要的，也是义不容辞的。因此，党对于家属的意见，应当接受；家属的工作，应当支持；家属的要求，应当尽可能的答复；第二，家属工作要加强团结。要求家庭团结好，邻居团结好。为了作好团结工作，首先是要体谅丈夫，了解对方的思想、生活和工作情况；另一方面，也要了解自己是主持家务的真正的家长。同时，党和工会要加强对职工的教育，要使职工知道家务劳动的重要意义；第三，必须克服困难才能前进。家属工作困难很多，表现在物质上、生活上、人与人的关系上、思想上。家属骨干分子都是不脱离生产的，负担很重，既要搞好自己的家务，又要作群众工作，有时还得不到自己丈夫的体谅；工作对象又是一家一户，难于工作，同时工作成绩又不容易为一般人见到。这些困难可以改善，也必须改善，党要支持，但是这样的工作一下子就要改变过来是有困难的，必须根据家属工作的特点，总结经验，把工作作好。
    接着，李雪峰同志介绍了目前的工作环境。他说，我们国家有了巨大的进步，各方面都取得了很大的成绩。这是工人阶级和全国人民辛勤劳动的结果。但是，困难很多，家底不足，生产水平不高，人口众多，而且很穷。我们要建设，就要摸清家底，要把困难向大家讲清楚，发动大家一起来想办法克服困难。你们做家属工作的经验也证明，只要把困难的情况讲清楚，群众是能够克服困难的。你们都是当家的，知道家不好当，国家这个家更不好当。不好当，但是一定要当好。党中央决定要在全党范围内开展整风运动，就是要克服工作中的各方面的缺点，把家当得更好。
    最后，李雪峰同志答复了代表们的要求：第一，要尽可能改善家属工作坏境，调整他们的工作负担；第二，恢复家属旁听党课和政治课的办法；第三，领导上要经常检查家属工作，要求企业领导者把家属工作作为自己工作的一部分，经常深入到宿舍中去；第四，吸收家属中的优秀分子入党；第五，在推广职工代表大会的地方，应当吸收家属代表列席。
