    Silkworm Breeding Model Lin Shuying Uses Rapid Silkworm Breeding Method to Raise Spring Silkworms
    (By our reporter) Wuhan, June 6 - Lin Shuying, a silkworm breeding model from Luotian County, Hubei Province, who attended the National Model Agricultural Laborers Representative Conference, used the rapid silkworm breeding method to trial-raise two silkworm egg sheets this year. The cocoon harvest was completed on May 23, with each sheet averaging 121.6 jin of silkworm cocoons, which is 1.6 jin more than the highest national silkworm cocoon record last year.
