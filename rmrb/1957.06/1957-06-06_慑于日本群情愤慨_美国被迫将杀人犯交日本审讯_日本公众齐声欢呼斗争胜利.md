Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th Dispatch: The United States government agreed on the 4th to allow Japan to try the American soldier Girard, who killed a Japanese woman. This decision was announced in a joint statement issued by Secretary of State Dulles and Secretary of Defense Wilson.

Under the protests of the Japanese people, the American representatives participating in the US-Japan Joint Committee had indicated on May 16th that the United States would not exercise jurisdiction over this case. However, the US Department of Defense subsequently reneged on its promise and refused to hand over the murderer to Japan for trial. This further激化激起了a wave of protests from the Japanese public.

The joint statement by Dulles and Wilson expressed concern about the indignation this case had aroused in Japan and other countries. The statement said, "To prolong the dispute over the issue of jurisdiction would create a situation that could fundamentally affect not only the relationship between the United States and Japan, but also the relationship between the United States and many other countries."

However, the statement emphasized that Girard's "rights" would be "fully protected" when he appeared for trial by the Japanese authorities. The statement said that the US authorities would ensure that "Girard and his defense lawyers have access to all evidence and will provide Girard and his defense lawyers with all appropriate assistance to protect his rights."

The statement also attempted to give the impression that Girard's shooting of the Japanese woman was within the scope of his normal military guard duties, and that the woman was killed through her own fault.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch: After the news that the United States finally agreed to allow Japan to try the American soldier Girard, who shot and killed the Japanese farmer Sakai Naka, the Japanese public cheered in unison for the victory of their struggle.

Japanese officials have repeatedly expressed welcome and satisfaction with the US decision. The Information and Culture Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today saying that the US decision is "greatly welcomed" "from the viewpoint of the entire relationship between Japan and the United States". The statement also guaranteed a fair trial for Girard. Japanese acting Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii also said: "Americans can rest assured that Girard will receive a fair trial."

Sakai Naka was shot and killed by Girard on January 30th this year while collecting bullet casings at the Somagahara training ground in Gunma Prefecture. The US-Japan Joint Committee had decided on May 16th to hand Girard over to Japan for trial, but the US Department of Defense ordered the decision to be prevented from being implemented the next day, which aroused a tide of protests in Japan.

Sakai Akiyoshi, the husband of Sakai Naka, hopes that the court can impartially try Girard for the murder of his wife. He believes that the United States' decision to let Japan try Girard is "acknowledging the real facts."

Kouzou Kawauchi, a judge at the Maebashi District Court in Gunma Prefecture, said that the case will be heard for the first time around mid-July after consultation with the prosecutor and the defendant's lawyer.

Ikurō Shimizu, a professor at Gakushuin University in Japan, believes that the US government was forced to take this action due to the widespread reaction to this case in Japan, as well as the recent anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan. The American International News Service also acknowledged that the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan undoubtedly influenced Dulles and Wilson's decision.

The US military authorities in Japan are currently refusing to comment on the Girard case. According to a Far East US military spokesman today, Girard will continue to be held in US custody and will not be transferred to a Japanese prison during the trial unless there is a "special" decision.

### 慑于日本群情愤慨  美国被迫将杀人犯交日本审讯  日本公众齐声欢呼斗争胜利

    慑于日本群情愤慨
    美国被迫将杀人犯交日本审讯
    日本公众齐声欢呼斗争胜利
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府4日同意由日本审讯杀死一个日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德。这个决定是在国务卿杜勒斯和国防部长威尔逊发表的一项联合声明中宣布的。
    在日本人民抗议下，参加美日联合委员会的美国代表在5月16日曾经表示过同意美国将不对这个案件行使裁判权。但是，美国国防部接着又背弃诺言，拒绝把杀人犯交给日本审讯。这进一步激起了日本公众的抗议浪潮。
    杜勒斯和威尔逊的联合声明对于这个案件在日本和其他国家所引起的愤慨表示不安。声明说，“要把在裁判权问题上的争端拖长下去，就会造成一种局面，以致可能不仅从根本上影响美国和日本的关系，还从根本上影响美国同很多其他国家的关系。”
    但是声明强调，哲腊德在出庭受日本当局审讯时，他的“权利”将要“受到完全的保护”。声明说，美国当局将保证“哲腊德和他的辩护律师能够得到一切证据，并且将给予哲腊德和他的辩护律师一切适当的帮助以保护他的权利”。
    声明在叙述杀人事件时还力图给人这样的印象：哲腊德开枪打死日本妇女是在他的正常的军事守卫职责的范围内，这名妇女被打死是咎由自取的。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：美国终于同意由日本审判枪杀日本农妇坂井中的美国兵哲腊德的消息传来之后，日本公众齐声为他们的斗争胜利欢呼。
    日本官方对美国的决定一再表示欢迎和满意。外务省情报文化局今天发表声明说：“从日美间整个关系的观点来看”美国的决定是“大受欢迎的”。声明并且保证对哲腊德进行公正的审判。日本代理首相石井光次郎也说：“美国人可以放心，哲腊德将得到公正的审判。”
    坂井中是今年1月30日在群马县相马原演习场拾取子弹壳的时候，被哲腊德枪杀的。日美联合委员会曾经在5月16日决定把哲腊德交给日本审理，但是美国国防部次日就下令阻止了这项决定的实现，因而在日本引起了抗议的怒潮。
    坂井中的丈夫坂井秋吉希望法庭能够秉公审判哲腊德杀害他的妻子的案件。他认为美国决定让日本审判哲腊德，是“承认真实的事实”。
    群马县前桥地方裁判所法官河内雄三说，这一案件将在同检察官和被告的律师商量以后，在7月中旬左右第一次开庭。
    日本学习院大学教授清水几太郎认为，美国政府迫于这一案件在日本所引起的广泛反应，以及最近在台湾发生的反美示威而不得不采取这一行动。美国的国际新闻社也承认，台湾的反美示威毫无疑问对杜勒斯和威尔逊的决定有影响。
    在日本的美军当局目前拒绝对哲腊德案件发表评论。据一个远东美军发言人今天说，除非有“特别的”决定，在审讯期间哲腊德将继续由美方监禁，并不移交给日本监狱。
