Shanghai, June 3rd (reported in our paper) – The Communist Party committees of twenty universities in Shanghai are promoting the Party's rectification movement by widely soliciting criticism from faculty and staff through symposiums. In the past month, according to incomplete statistics from various schools, more than a thousand symposiums of various types have been held, forming an unprecedentedly active democratic life in Shanghai's higher education sector since liberation.

"Words Bottled Up in Our Hearts
Have All Been Spoken"

The symposiums convened by the Party organizations of Shanghai universities this time have implemented the spirit of encouraging criticism. In some schools' departments, 80% to 90% of non-Party members spoke at the symposiums. At Fudan University, about 80% of the 170-plus professors participated in the symposiums, excluding those who were ill or had other commitments. Some professors said that this symposium allowed them to speak all the words that had been bottled up in their hearts since liberation. Symposiums at Shanghai First Medical College, East China Normal University, Tongji University, and other institutions of higher learning were also exceptionally active. People launched sharp and sincere criticisms of the Party's work during the symposiums, exposing a large number of facts about bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism in Shanghai's higher education work. Some schools even engaged in named criticism. For example, teachers and staff at Shanghai Fisheries College severely criticized Wang Wenrui, the secretary of the college's Party committee, for his crude and dictatorial style toward intellectuals (Wang Wenrui has now been removed from his post).

Party Cadres' Ideology Improves
Actively Cancel Special Privileges

The Party organizations in Shanghai's universities have adopted an attitude of humbly listening to criticism from the masses, requiring criticized Party members not to be dispirited or lose confidence in the face of mass criticism, but to strengthen themselves, learn lessons from it with a positive attitude, and improve their thinking and work. According to reports from various schools, most Communist Party members have done this. A few Communist Party members in the First Medical College and other units felt that their houses were more spacious than others, so they took the initiative to give up their houses to non-Party members who needed them. Some Communist Party members holding leadership positions have also taken the initiative to apply for the cancellation of some special material benefits.

While holding symposiums, the Party organizations of Shanghai's universities promptly studied the criticisms raised by the people. Some specific problems that could be solved immediately were solved immediately, and some major problems that could not be solved immediately but had to be solved were also being addressed.

Draft Proposals for Improving School Work
Establish Organizations to Handle Specific Problems

The Party Committee of Fudan University and the Party Committee of Shanghai First Normal College, based on the criticisms and suggestions of everyone, have jointly drafted a proposed draft of suggestions for improving school work. The proposals put forward specific improvement measures regarding the school's leadership system, teaching and scientific research work, and students' political and ideological education. These drafts have now been sent to the professors for discussion and revision, and after everyone reaches a consensus, they will be submitted to the higher-level leading organs for consideration. Most of Shanghai's universities have now established specialized organizations to handle problems. These organizations are composed of Party and non-Party personnel, and they are responsible for studying and solving various specific problems raised by the people in the symposiums. East China Normal University has established three groups to deal with teaching and scientific research problems, system problems, and the Party's political work. The First Medical College has established a materials sorting group and an opinion research and handling committee, led by two deans, absorbing people from various departments to participate. Under the leadership of these specialized organizations, some specific problems have begun to be solved. Some people in the First Medical College and other units who were wrongly criticized in past movements have now been apologized to and had their "hats" removed. Some inappropriate personnel arrangements and some teachers with low ratings in Shanghai Fisheries College and Fudan University have been adjusted or are being adjusted.

Absorbing the criticisms of the professors, the administrative side of Fudan University has also delegated some powers to the departments. For example, in the past, the school's Academic Affairs Office tightly controlled the elective courses and specialized courses offered by each department, but now each department can control them independently. Student performance exams, assessments, and teacher training are all decided by the department.

Checking While Improving
People Are Satisfied

People are satisfied with Shanghai's universities' practice of "checking while improving."

About half of Shanghai's universities have basically concluded the activities of the faculty and staff symposiums and have begun to listen to students' criticisms of the Party's work. About one-third of the schools are still continuing to hold faculty and staff symposiums. Based on the actual situation in Shanghai for more than a month, convening symposiums to help the Party carry out the rectification movement is a relatively good way. It is easier to have in-depth and detailed discussions when everyone is face-to-face, and it also allows for the exchange of thoughts and opinions, which is more conducive to solving problems.

    虚心倾听批评　积极解决问题
    上海高等学校采取措施改进工作
    本报上海3日电　上海二十个高等学校的共产党党委，采取召开座谈会的方式，广泛听取校内教职员工的批评，来推动党的整风运动。近一月来，据各校不完全统计，各类座谈会已达千次以上，形成了上海高等教育界解放以来一次空前活跃的民主生活。
    “几年来堆在心头的话
    统统说出来了”
    上海高等学校党组织这次召开的座谈会，贯彻了鼓励开展批评的精神，有些学校系科的座谈会，做到80％到90％的党外人士都发了言。复旦大学一百七十多个教授，除病、事假外，有80％左右参加了座谈。有些教授说，这一次的座谈，把解放几年来堆在心头的话统统说出来了。上海第一医学院、华东师范大学、同济大学等高等院校的座谈会，都开得异常活跃。人们在座谈中对党的工作展开了尖锐、恳切的批评，揭露了上海高等教育工作中官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的大量事实。有些学校还进行了指名的批评。如上海水产学院的教师和员工，严厉地批评了该院党委书记王文锐对待知识分子的粗暴专横作风（王文锐现已受到撤职处分）。
    党员干部思想提高
    主动取消特殊待遇
    上海各校党组织对于来自群众的批评，采取了虚心倾听的态度，要求被批评的党员不要在群众批评的面前垂头丧气，丧失信心，要坚强起来，以积极态度从中记取教训，提高思想和改进工作。据各校汇报，多数共产党员都做到了这一点。第一医学院等单位的少数共产党员感到自己住的房子比别人宽敞，就主动让出房屋给需要房屋的党外人士。也有些担任领导工作的共产党员已主动申请取消一些特殊的物质待遇。
    在召开座谈会的同时，上海各高等学校党组织及时地研究人们提出的批评，有些可以马上解决的具体问题就马上解决，有些即使不能立即解决但必须解决的重大问题，也抓紧进行。
  拟订改进学校工作草案
    成立组织处理具体问题
    复旦大学党委会、上海第一师范学院党委会根据大家的批评和建议，已协同行政拟出了一个改进学校工作的建议草案。其中关于今后学校的领导制度问题、教学和科学研究工作、学生政治思想教育工作等方面，都提出了具体改进办法。这些草案现在已发给教授们进行讨论修正，待大家取得一致意见后，再送请上级领导机关考虑。现在上海大部分高等学校都已成立了处理问题的专门组织。这些组织由党内外的工作人员共同组成，他们负责研究和解决人们在座谈会中提出的各种具体问题。华东师范大学成立了教学与科学研究问题、体制问题、党的政治工作等三个组。第一医学院成立了材料整理小组和意见研究处理委员会，由两位院长负责，吸收各部门的人参加。在这些专门组织的领导下，有些具体问题已开始着手解决。第一医学院等单位有些人过去在各项运动中被斗错了，现已分别向他们道歉，摘掉“帽子”。上海水产学院、复旦大学过去有些人事安排不当，有些教师评级偏低，现在已进行调整或正在调整。
    吸收教授们的批评，复旦大学行政方面也已将一部分权力下放到系。例如过去学校教务处对各系开设选修课、专门化课抓得很紧，现在各系可以自行掌握。学生成绩考试、考查和教师的进修，都由系决定。
    边检查，边改进
    人们感到满意
    上海各高等学校这种“一边检查、一边改进”的做法，人们是满意的。
    上海现在约有半数以上的高等学校已基本上结束了教师职员座谈会的活动，开始听取同学们对党的各项工作的批评。约有三分之一左右的学校还在继续举行教师、职员座谈会。根据上海一个多月来的实际情况看，召开座谈会来帮助党开展整风运动，这是一个比较好的方式。大家面对面地一起谈，容易谈得深入、细致，并且还可以做到相互交流思想和意见，这样也就更有利于解决问题。
