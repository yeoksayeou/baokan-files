Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Australian Labor Party delegation, which arrived in Beijing yesterday.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended as a guest.

In his speech, Zhang Xiruo said that although Australia and China are not geographically close, people-to-people exchanges between the two countries have been much more frequent in recent years than in the past. Zhang Xiruo also mentioned some of the proposals made by the leader of the Australian Labor Party, Dr. Evatt, such as calling for a halt to hydrogen bomb testing, banning the use of nuclear weapons, and supporting the recognition of New China and the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He continued, "We welcome proposals that are in the interests of the people of both countries."

The head of the Australian Labor Party delegation, Mr. Haylen, said that this delegation is the first Australian Labor Party delegation to visit China. He expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality he had received from all sides.

When talking about the Australian Labor Party's policy towards China, he said, "The Labor Party's proposals put forward by Dr. Evatt are to establish normal relations between Australia and China, restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and expand trade between Australia and China. These proposals will surely be realized."

He concluded by saying that he was willing to report everything he had seen in China to the Australian people through newspapers and parliament as much as possible after returning home.

　　张奚若宴请澳工党议员访华团
    宾主一致认为应进一步发展两国关系
    新华社22日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今晚设宴欢迎昨天抵京的澳大利亚工党议员访华团。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通出席作陪。
    张奚若在致词中说，澳大利亚和中国在地理上并不算近，可是几年来两国人民之间的交往比过去要频繁得多了。张奚若还提到了澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特博士的一些主张，如呼吁停止试验氢弹，禁止使用核武器以及赞成承认新中国和恢复中国在联合国的合法地位等。他接着说，对符合两国人民利益的主张，我们表示欢迎。
    澳大利亚工党议员访华团团长海伦说，这个代表团是第一个访问中国的澳大利亚工党代表团。他对各方面的热诚招待表示感谢。
    在谈到澳大利亚工党的对华政策时，他说：“伊瓦特博士所提出的工党主张是建立澳中两国正常关系、恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位和扩大澳中两国贸易，这些主张一定能得到实现。”
    他最后表示愿意把在中国看到的一切，在回国后尽量通过报刊和议会向澳大利亚人民作报道。
