It is urgent to solve the problem of excessive burden on primary school teachers
　　Tuguang
    In recent years, at many large and small meetings of primary schools in Beijing, school administrators and teachers have frequently reported that teachers' workload is too heavy. I have personally observed in some primary schools and feel that this problem is indeed very serious.
    Before 1956, primary school teachers had six regular activities: lesson preparation, teaching, correcting homework, handling student disputes, professional development, and attending meetings, generally working more than ten hours a day. This year, the workload of primary school teachers has increased even more, because during this period, it was proposed to strengthen ideological and political work in schools. Teachers themselves had to study current affairs and policies, manage all student activities inside and outside the school, and strengthen students' moral education. As a result, the workload of general teachers reached more than twelve hours a day, and some teachers worked as long as fifteen or sixteen hours.
    The increasing burden on primary school teachers and the deteriorating health conditions have formed a "vicious cycle." At present, more than one-third of the teachers in many primary schools suffer from chronic diseases such as lung disease, neurasthenia, arthritis, anemia, and high blood pressure, and each school often has two or three or more teachers on sick leave.
    Teachers' work is not only too long, but also very labor-intensive. While teaching, teachers have to talk eloquently while keeping an eye on forty or fifty children to prevent them from being chaotic. After teaching several classes in a row, they are exhausted, sitting on hard benches panting, and their brains are dizzy and swollen. Some teachers even fainted in the classroom while teaching. But despite this, after class, children fight and cause trouble and find the teacher, and the teacher has to deal with it. Many teachers can't even eat on time. When they go to meetings or study, they can only be listless, force themselves to cheer up, and some fall asleep.
    Being busy during the day, they can't prepare lessons well or finish correcting homework, so they have to move it to the evening and Sunday. In the past six months, due to the strengthening of students' extracurricular education work, they sometimes have to visit parents in the evening and tutor family study groups. Female teachers with children have even more difficulties, and they have to wait until their children are asleep before they can work. Some teachers work at night, and their spirits can't support them, so they use cold water to ice their heads, apply balm to their eyelids, and beat their thighs with their hands to stimulate nerve excitement, and insist on working until twelve o'clock, one o'clock, or two o'clock.
    Why is the burden on primary school teachers so heavy? There are four reasons:
    First, teachers have too many non-teaching activities, which is relatively easy to solve. The method adopted by Beijing is: strict control from the education authorities of the party and government at the municipal and district levels to the grass-roots organizations of the school. No matter who assigns work to the teacher without going through the "busy and chaotic cadres," the teacher can reject it. If there is a central task, make appropriate arrangements. But this does not solve all the problems.
    Second, primary school teachers have a lot of administrative work. For example, there are many types of fees that teachers charge students every year - tuition, book fees, notebook fees, travel fees, movie fees, injections, handicraft material fees, red scarf fees, breakfast fees, etc. Some fees are not paid by students at the same time, but are divided into several payments, three cents, two cents, or even a few cents are collected. Each collection requires registration, safekeeping, and going through procedures with the clerk. There are also countless statistical tables. Initial school report, disease statistics, breakfast, nap, morning exercises, grade assessment, etc. must be counted every day. Teachers spend almost an hour doing this work every day.
    Third, the staffing is small, and the requirements are high. I will first talk about the unreasonable and excessive demands on teachers.
    There are too many and too rapid changes in teaching. For example, in the language textbook, there used to be more texts that cooperated with political movements, but later there were more literary texts. The texts are long, and first and second graders have to learn 1,500 characters. Textbooks are changed every year, and teachers' burden of preparing lessons cannot be reduced. Especially after Chinese language is taught separately, many teachers do not know Chinese and have to teach while learning, which is even more burdensome.
    There are also many changes in teaching methods. In 1954, rote learning was opposed, and teaching was changed to using the talking method. Later, teachers were required to be able to read emotionally, guide retelling, and strengthen language factors in teaching. Last year, oral composition, extracurricular reading promotion and guidance were added. As soon as a teaching method is learned, it is either criticized or another new teaching method is learned. Not only new teachers cannot teach well, but even old teachers are at a loss and don't know whether to laugh or cry. If the subjects taught by teachers change again, preparing lessons is even more difficult.
    It is completely right for teachers to comprehensively care for the growth of children, but the problem is that teachers are required to be fully responsible. They have to manage children in class, and they have to manage games after class; they have to manage children's extracurricular activities, and they have to manage school activities; they have to manage students' learning, and they have to manage their lives; they have to manage students in school, and they have to manage them when they return home; they have to manage students studying in school, and they also have to manage them reviewing books in family study groups; they have to manage extracurricular activity groups that they are good at, and they also have to manage extracurricular activity groups that they are not good at. So teachers have to contact the Children's Palace, cultural centers and stations, borrow cars from all parties to let children travel, borrow costumes to let children perform, persuade parents to patiently educate children, and run several miles every day to tutor family study groups, etc.
    The education administrative department has adopted a doctrinaire attitude on the workload of teachers. Regardless of our teachers' conditions and social conditions, all the requirements of the Soviet Union for primary school teachers are dumped on our teachers' heads, and even more so. Naturally, learning from the Soviet Union is right, but it must be combined with the actual situation. Many teachers criticize the Ministry of Education for "only knowing addition and not subtraction."
    Does the Ministry of Education only know addition and not subtraction? The fact is not entirely so. The Ministry of Education is very good at subtraction in the staffing of primary school teachers. The staffing of primary school teachers and staff has been increased from twenty-six to one to thirty to one. This staffing ratio seems to be very reasonable from a subjective point of view. For example, a twelve-class primary school with fifty students in each class can have six hundred students in the whole school. Calculated at thirty to one, there can be twenty teachers and staff members. In addition to the twelve teachers serving as class teachers, the school can also have one principal, one director of teaching, three subject teachers, one clerk, and two workers. Subject teachers teach twenty-four classes each, and the principal, director of teaching, and clerk teach six classes each, for a total of ninety classes. Each class has seven or eight classes that are not taught by the class teacher, and the class teacher is only responsible for seventeen or eighteen classes. If calculated according to this number, it seems that the workload of the class teacher is not too heavy.
    However, the facts are different from the subjective calculations of the Ministry of Education.
    For example, in Soviet primary schools, there are generally only thirty-five students in each class, while in our primary schools, there are about fifty students in each class, and the time for teachers to correct homework and work as class teachers is naturally increased.
    In addition, primary school classrooms in our country generally cannot accommodate fifty students. Taking Beijing as an example, in order to expand the capacity of each classroom, it is necessary to transform the temple-style classrooms, widen the front porch, and turn the classrooms into square blocks, and stipulate that each student occupies only 0.9 square meters (Soviet primary school students occupy 1.2 square meters per person). Not to mention that this kind of classroom will hinder the health of students' eyes and lungs, even so, many primary school classrooms cannot accommodate fifty people. According to the thirty to one regulation, the staffing of teachers and staff has to be greatly reduced.
    Due to this reason, the twelve-class primary school in Beijing has no director of teaching, the principal cannot teach part-time, the subject teachers are not three, but one or two, and the class teachers not only teach Chinese and arithmetic, but also have to take on one more subject. With one more subject, the burden of preparing lessons and correcting homework is naturally increased. The number of workers in the twelve-class school is also reduced, and the clerical work of teachers is naturally increased. In rural areas, due to dispersion, the number of students in each class is even smaller, and the staffing is even tighter, often thirty-eight to one. Therefore, many primary schools in rural areas do not have a single worker, and teachers have to teach everything and manage everything. The heavy burden can be imagined.
    The time has come, I hope that in the rectification movement, the Ministry of Education, the State Planning Commission, and the State Staffing Commission will quickly solve this problem. There are four ways to solve it: 1. Establish an extracurricular education system; 2. Appropriately expand the staffing of primary school teachers and staff; 3. Cancel unreasonable and excessive demands; 4. Strictly control chaos and uniformly arrange teachers' non-teaching activities. 5. Give teachers with extremely poor health the opportunity to recuperate, and ensure that general teachers have more than half of their holidays to rest.

　　迫切需要解决小学教师负担过重的问题
　　土光
    近几年来，北京市小学许多大大小小的会议上，学校的行政干部和教师经常地反映教师的工作量过重，我到一些小学亲自观察，也感到这个问题确很严重。
    小学教师在1956年以前的经常活动有六项：即备课，上课，批改作业，处理学生纠纷，业务进修和开会，一般每天工作达十小时以上。今年小学教师的工作量更大了，因为这一时期，提出了加强学校的思想政治工作，教师自己要学习时事政策，要管学生校内外的一切活动和加强学生的品德教育，于是一般教师的工作量每天长达十二小时以上，部分教师有长达十五、六小时的。
    小学教师的负担日益过重和健康状况的日益下降，已形成为“恶性循环”。目前，不少小学有三分之一以上的教师患有肺病、神经衰弱、关节炎、贫血、高血压等慢性病，每所学校经常有两三位以上的教师请病假。
    教师的工作不仅时间过长，而且劳动强度很大。上课的时候，教师一边要侃侃而讲，一边要盯着四、五十个孩子乱不乱。连上几堂课后，就精疲力竭，坐在硬板凳上喘气，脑子发昏发胀。有些教师还在正上课的时候晕倒在教室里。但是尽管如此，下课了，孩子打架闹事找到老师，老师不能不处理。不少教师连饭也不能准时吃，到开会或者学习的时候，就只能无精打彩，强振精神，有的就睡着了。
    白天忙忙碌碌，备不好课，改不完作业，就只好挪到晚上和星期日来做。这半年由于加强了学生校外教育工作，有时晚上还要去访问家长，辅导家庭学习小组，有孩子的女教师更困难，晚上要等孩子睡了才能工作。有些教师晚上工作，精神支持不住，就用冷水冰脑袋，用万金油涂眼皮，用手捶大腿，来刺激神经兴奋，坚持干到十二点、一点、两点。
    小学教师的负担为什么这么重呢？原因有以下四点：
    第一、教师的非教学活动过多，这一点是比较好解决的。北京市采取的办法是：从市、区两级的党和政府的教育主管部门，直到学校的基层组织都严格控制，不经过专管“忙乱的干部”，不管谁向教师布置工作，教师都可以顶回去。遇到中心工作，适当加以安排。但是这并不解决全部问题。
    第二、小学教师的事务性工作很多，例如收费，教师每年向学生收费的种类很多——学杂费、买书费、本子费、旅行费、电影费、打针、手工劳动材料费、买红领巾费、早点费等等，有些费学生并不同时交，要分作几次交，三角两角甚而几分的收，收一次要登记，保管，和事务员办手续。再如统计表不知道有多少，学期初报表、疾病统计、吃早点、午睡、晨操、成绩考核等等都要天天统计，教师每天做这个工作几乎要用一小时。
    第三、编制小，要求高。我先谈对教师的不合理的过高的要求。
    教学上变化太多太急，如语文教材，过去是配合政治运动的课文多，以后文艺性的课文多了，课文长，一、二年级要学一千五百字。年年换教材，教师备课负担就不能减轻，特别是汉语文学分教后，许多老师不会汉语，不得不边学边卖，负担更重。
    在教法方面也是变化很多，1954年反对串讲，改成用谈话法教学，以后又要求教师能情感性的朗读，指导复述，加强教学中的语文因素。去年还添了口述作文、课外阅读宣传和指导。一个教法刚学会，不是紧跟着批判了，就是再学一个新教法，不仅新教师教不好，连老教师也无所适从，哭笑不得，加上教师所教课目再有变动，备课就更费力气了。
    教师要全面关心儿童的成长，这是完全应该的，问题在于要教师全面负责，孩子上课要管，下课后游戏也要管；孩子的课外活动要管，校外活动也要管；学生的学习要管，生活也要管；学生在学校里要管，回到家里也要管；学生在学校里上自习要管，回去在家庭学习小组内温书也要管；和自己擅长的学生课外活动小组要管，自己不擅长的课外小组也要管。于是教师要和少年之家，文化馆、站联系，要向各方面借汽车让孩子旅行，借服装让孩子演戏，要说服家长耐心教育孩子，要每天跑几里路辅导家庭学习小组，等等。
    教育行政部门在教师工作量上采取了教条主义态度，不管我们的教师条件和社会条件，凡是苏联对小学教师的要求，都一古脑儿往我们的教师头上堆，且有过之而无不及。自然，学习苏联是对的，但是要结合实际情况。许多教师批评教育部“只懂加法，不懂减法”。
    教育部是不是只懂加法，不懂减法呢？事实不完全如此。教育部在小学教师编制上却是很懂得减法的。小学教职工的编制由二十六比一提高到三十比一，这个编制比例从主观上来看，仿佛是很合理的。比如一个十二班的小学，每班有五十个学生，全校可达六百个学生，按三十比一算，就可以有二十个教职工，除十二个担任级任教师外，学校还可以有校长一人，教导主任一人，科任教师三人，事务员一人，工友二人。科任教师每人担任二十四节课，校长教导主任和事务员每人担任六节课，总共九十节课，每班就有七、八节不是级任老师教，级任老师也就只担任十七、八节课了，如按这个数字计算，好像级任教师的工作量并不过重。
    但是，事实同教育部主观主义打的算盘是不一样的。
    比如说，苏联小学每班学生一般只有三十五人，而我国小学每班约五十人，教师批改作业，作班主任工作的时间当然加重了。
    另外，我国小学教室一般容纳不了五十个学生。以北京为例，为了扩充每班教室的容量，就不得不把庙宇式的教室改造一下，把前廊推宽，把教室变成四方块，而且规定每个学生只占点九平方米（苏联小学生每人占一点二平方米），且不说这种教室会妨碍学生眼睛和肺部的健康，就是这样，很多小学教室也容纳不到五十人。按三十比一的规定，教职工的编制就不得不大大缩小。
    由于这种原因，北京市十二班的小学就没有了教导主任，校长就不能兼课了，科任教师就不是三个，而是一两个，级任教师就不只是教语文和算术，要多担任一个头的功课，多一个头，备课，批改作业自然增加了负担。十二班的学校工友也少了，教员的事务性工作就自然增加了。农村因分散，每班学额更少，编制就更紧，往往是三十八比一，于是农村许多小学没有一个职员工友，教师就得什么都教，什么都管，负担之重，可以想见。
    到时候了，我希望在整风运动中，教育部和国家计划委员会、国家编制委员会迅速解决这一问题。解决之途有四：一、建立校外教育体系；二、适当扩充小学教职工编制；三、取消不合理的过高要求；四、严格控制忙乱，统一安排教师的非教学活动。五、对健康极坏的教师给以休养的机会，对一般教师保证假期有一半以上的时间休息。
