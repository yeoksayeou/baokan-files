Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Taipei news: Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement yesterday regarding the large-scale anti-American demonstration in Taiwan. He said, "Since the unfortunate incident on the 24th of last month in Taipei City, where the American embassy was damaged," he felt this was "a major shock in my fifty years" and "the greatest regret in my life."

The Taiwanese people's anti-American patriotic demonstration has gained the support of the people throughout the country and the sympathy and support of fair world opinion. However, it made Chiang Kai-shek feel "most heartbroken." With "a heavy heart," he said, "This incident is truly an unfortunate encounter for our nation," and "has caused indelible stains on the credibility of our entire country and the dignity of the nation." This is what Chiang Kai-shek considers the so-called "nation."

In the statement, Chiang Kai-shek also slapped himself in the face to please the United States, saying that "Zhongzheng's virtue is thin and his ability is lacking." He also said, "The personnel responsible for maintaining law and order in this unfortunate incident were negligent in prevention beforehand, and failed to make decisive decisions in handling the situation; even when the mass demonstrations turned into riots, they remained indecisive, allowing them to spread, which is truly distressing." Chiang Kai-shek also stated that he had "explicitly ordered the dismissal of the heads of security at the time" and punished the arrested demonstrators to explain things to the Americans.

In the statement, Chiang Kai-shek hypocritically said, "I deeply understand that the general public on the 24th felt indignant about the verdict in the Reynolds case, which led to激昂emotions." However, he then slanderously accused the emotionally激昂anti-American demonstrations of the masses as "illegal violence," saying that "激昂emotions should not be allowed to evolve into illegal violence." Chiang Kai-shek also said that his so-called "national policy" is to be on "the same front as our leader, the United States," and "will not allow anyone to oppose it." He probably knows that the people of Taiwan have a widespread and profound anti-American sentiment, which is incompatible with this Chiang-style "national policy." Therefore, he fantasized and said: "I earnestly hope that every school, every family, teachers teach their students, parents educate their children, ... from now on, we must be intimate with American expatriates, our allies."

In addition to repeating the cliches of so-called "anti-communism and resistance to Russia" in the statement, Chiang Kai-shek also mentioned some historical facts of the Chinese people resisting imperialist aggression in the past century. Chiang Kai-shek's views on these historical facts completely imitate the imperialists, confusing right and wrong and reversing black and white. He actually believed that the armed invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance, including the United States, which forced the Qing government to sign the unequal Treaty of 1901, the "Boxer Protocol," was not the responsibility of the imperialist aggression of the United States and other countries, but of the "Boxer Rebellion."

### 蒋介石向美国侵略者献媚  竟诬指台湾人民反美示威为“非法暴行”

    蒋介石向美国侵略者献媚
    竟诬指台湾人民反美示威为“非法暴行”
    新华社2日讯　台北消息：蒋介石昨天就台湾发生反美大示威事件发表文告，其中说：“自上月24日台北市发生损毁美国大使馆的不幸事件以来”，他感到这是他“五十年中一次很大的刺激”，也是他“平生一件莫大的遗憾”。
    台湾人民反美爱国大示威获得了全国人民的声援和世界公正舆论的同情和支持。但是，却使蒋介石感到“最痛心”。他以“沉痛的心情”说：“这次事件真是我们国家民族不幸的遭遇”，“使我们整个国家的信誉和民族的尊严蒙受了不易洗清的污点”。蒋介石心目中的所谓“国家民族”，就是如此。
    在文告中，蒋介石还自打嘴巴，以讨好美国，说是“中正德薄鲜能，领导无方”。并且说：“在这次不幸事件中负责维持治安的人员，事前既疏于防范，临事又不能当机立断，负责处置；甚至于群众示威行动变质而为暴动之时，仍然犹豫不决，任致蔓延，实堪痛心。”蒋介石还申述已经把“当时治安首长明令撤职”，惩办被捕的示威群众等，来向美国人交代。
    在文告中，蒋介石假惺惺地说：“我深切了解，24日一般群众为了对雷诺案件的判决痛感不平，以致情绪激昂。”但是，他跟着诬指情绪激昂的群众反美示威为“非法暴行”，说是“不当让激昂的情绪演变为非法的暴行”。蒋介石还说，他的所谓“国策”是与“领导者的美国站在一条阵线”，“决不容许任何人反对”。他大概知道台湾人民有着普遍的深刻的反美情绪，和这种蒋记“国策”水火不相容。因此，他异想天开地说：“我切望每一学校，每一家庭，师长教导其学生，父母训育其子女，……今后要对我们盟邦美国侨民亲睦无间。”
    蒋介石在文告中除了还重复所谓“反共抗俄”的滥调以外，还提到近百年来中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略的一些历史事实。蒋介石在对这些历史事实的看法上，完全向帝国主义者学样，混淆是非，颠倒黑白。他竟认为美国等八国联军武装侵略中国，强迫清朝政府在1901年签订不平等条约“辛丑和约”，其责任不在于美国等帝国主义的侵略，而在于“义和团的暴动”。
