　　How to Centralize the Use of Repair Workshops
　　—Discussion Opinions of Technical Personnel from the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Second Ministry of Machine Building
　　By our reporter Gu Lei
    The rational construction and use of repair workshops is a very complex matter, involving hundreds or thousands of enterprises. If this problem is solved well, it can save the country a lot of money. This newspaper has published editorials and articles on this subject, proposing to strengthen inter-enterprise cooperation in this area. If there are already mechanical repair factories in the same area that can be utilized, new enterprises can refrain from building new ones; those that have built too many should arrange for other uses or transfer the equipment; in new industrial areas, consideration can be given to establishing central mechanical repair factories.
    The issue raised by the newspaper has attracted the attention of many technical personnel. More than fifty technical personnel from the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Second Ministry of Machine Building spontaneously organized a symposium to study ways to solve this problem. At the two symposiums, everyone agreed that the issue raised by the newspaper was important and timely. However, some people believed that some of the opinions put forward by the newspaper, such as building less or not building at all, were premature and imprudent conclusions that could easily cause difficulties in actual work. Because many issues need to be specifically studied, such as what exactly are the tasks of the repair workshop? Can it be built less, and how can it be built less? How to organize inter-enterprise cooperation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralizing or decentralizing repair workshops? Since the product nature of each enterprise is different, should this issue be treated differently? Everyone discussed these issues, and most of them have not yet reached a consensus. The two sides of the discussion are now summarized for the reference of those who care about this matter.
    What exactly are the tasks of the repair workshop?
    The reason why repair workshops in various enterprises, especially some newly built enterprises, are large is because they bear too many tasks.
    When discussing how to determine the tasks of the repair workshop, there were three opinions.
    One opinion is that China's machinery industry has greatly developed and can supply more equipment for capital construction and production maintenance than in the past. This makes it possible to control the tasks of the repair workshop within the scope of maintenance, and to obtain the parts needed for maintenance through cooperation, which can greatly reduce the scale of the repair workshop.
    Another opinion is that it is still necessary for the repair workshop to maintain a considerable manufacturing capacity, otherwise it will not be possible to ensure smooth production. Because each production enterprise has different characteristics, with both general-purpose equipment and special equipment, the number of equipment needed for maintenance is not too large, but it is very fragmented, making it difficult to order. Even if the goods are ordered, it is not easy to get them in time. They do not agree with drastically reducing the scale of the repair workshop.
    Another opinion is that the size of the repair workshop depends on how many parts can be cooperated with. Under normal circumstances, the manufacturing capacity of general-purpose parts can be compressed, and non-standard equipment should still be manufactured by the enterprise itself. However, at the same time, we must see that China's standardization of mechanical equipment is still very backward. In this case, how to organize cooperation in general-purpose parts is still something that should be carefully considered and cannot be too hasty.
    In short, some people tend to actively take measures to reduce the repair workshop, while others are hesitant, but they all hope that the leading organs will quickly study this issue.
    Which types of work should be centralized?
    When discussing whether repair workshops can be centralized, the unanimous opinion is that we should first consider which types of work can be centralized and which types should not be centralized, and then we can specifically compare the advantages and disadvantages.
    The repair workshop in an enterprise includes many types of work. Broadly speaking, one part is manufacturing and the other part is repair (fitter, etc.). To break it down further, in addition to the machine repair workshop, there are some special types of work, such as the riveting and welding section in oil refining and chemical plants.
    Therefore, the centralization and cooperation of repair workshops mainly involves the part that manufactures spare parts, rather than the maintenance (fitter) force. Each enterprise must still retain enough maintenance workers to ensure the completion of maintenance tasks. This has many benefits. The maintenance workers in a factory not only replace certain equipment during major repairs, but also bear the tasks of daily maintenance and repair, and timely troubleshooting of equipment failures. These people are familiar with the equipment situation of the factory, which can improve maintenance efficiency, ensure maintenance quality, and reduce maintenance costs.
    The centralization of repair workshops generally only applies to machine repair workshops and should not include special types of work. For example, if there is only one oil refinery in a region and the rest are machine factories, the task of the riveting and welding section of the oil refinery is to repair or process various large containers, and other factories rarely use this type of work. Centralization would only add an extra procedure. However, if there are several similar enterprises in a region, special types of work can still be considered for centralized use.
    Everyone's opinion is basically the same, believing that we should currently focus on the construction and use of machine repair workshops.
    How to centralize?
    At the symposium, what everyone talked about most was the issue of how to uniformly allocate, organize cooperation, and rationally construct and utilize machine repair workshops. There were seven opinions in total.
    The first is to abolish the machine repair workshops of enterprises and establish a central machine repair factory in a region to supply the equipment parts needed by various enterprises for maintenance. Those who put forward this opinion believe that the advantages of doing so are: it can reduce the phenomenon of equipment duplication and idle, it can form a stronger processing capacity, it is convenient to rationally allocate technical forces and strengthen technical management, it saves tooling, it is easy to balance production capacity, and it reduces idle time.
    Some people object to this approach, arguing that there are many enterprises in a region, and their nature is not similar. If they are forced to centralize, the scale of the central repair factory will be quite large, making it difficult to arrange and balance the production plan. In addition, who will lead it, who will design it, and who will build it? These problems cannot be solved immediately.
    The second is to organize the repair workshops of enterprises with similar production characteristics in a region to establish a repair factory. The advantage of doing so is that because the production characteristics are similar, not only can the machine repair capacity be unified, but also other types of work can be unified; not only can general-purpose parts be cooperated with, but also special parts have versatility, which can concentrate special equipment and reduce equipment costs; it is also easy to arrange the production plan for maintenance spare parts.
    There are two reasons for opposing this approach: One, who will lead this repair factory? It is easier to handle if these companies belong to one department, but if they belong to more than two departments, who will be the main one, and how can it be guaranteed that departmentalism will not occur? Another, if the machine repair capacity of these companies is not large, it may not be necessary to add this layer of trouble.
    The third is to use the large to lead the small, that is, in a region, a large enterprise with a large machine repair workshop can unify the existing machine repair workshops of several small enterprises, or some small enterprises will no longer build or expand machine repair workshops, and then uniformly arrange tasks.
    This opinion was opposed by many people, who believed that although there may be some savings, it is a complex cooperative relationship. The biggest problem is that small enterprises often have to seek help from large enterprises, and large enterprises are unwilling to have this management trouble; when maintenance tasks are tight, it is easy to have difficult-to-resolve contradictions.
    The fourth is that the machine repair workshops of each factory only retain the processing capacity for parts used in medium and small repairs, and take out the force for manufacturing parts during major repairs to form a central repair factory, or order from outside. Because during major repairs, many equipment must be replaced, it is more appropriate to entrust it to the central repair factory, so as to avoid preparing a large maintenance capacity but not being able to completely contract the work during major repairs.
    There are also different opinions on this, believing that this has not yet solved the problem of how to establish the central repair factory and how to carry out production, and it is not necessarily very economical in terms of equipment utilization. For example, during major or medium repairs, the same special equipment is needed to manufacture parts. Even if the major repair work is distributed, it is still necessary to install one or several special equipment, and its utilization rate must not be high.
    The fifth is that the machine repair workshops of each enterprise only retain the processing capacity for repairing standard parts, and distribute the manufacturing tasks of non-standard parts. According to the situation of many machine repair workshops, the most idle time is usually spent on certain special equipment for manufacturing non-standard parts. Therefore, building machine repair factories that produce non-standard equipment according to the industrial department system, or organizing such factories in a region, can reduce the cost of special equipment.
    Some people believe that this is not possible. According to past experience, it is often non-standard equipment rather than standard equipment that delays maintenance work. Therefore, factories should retain the manufacturing capacity of non-standard equipment and distribute the manufacturing capacity of standard equipment.
    Sixth, feeling that there are currently inconsistent opinions in this regard, there are many difficulties, and there is no experience, it is best to first organize two or three enterprises belonging to the same industrial department and adjacent to each other in a region to cooperate, study the issue of cooperation, and then promote it. In this way, it can be avoided to get too hasty and hinder production. At the symposium of the Second Ministry of Machine Building, most people agreed with this opinion.
    Seventh, the individual comrade's opinion is that the machine repair workshop cannot be centralized, and it is more convenient to have one's own. No one at the meeting agreed with this opinion.
    Consistent views on three issues
    Although the above opinions are inconsistent, consistent views have been reached on three issues. One is that if a central repair factory is to be established, it is best to be led by the local government, which can both prevent departmentalism and uniformly arrange tasks with other local machine repair forces. The other is that if a small-scale cooperation is to be organized, it is best to adjust it based on one industrial department, which is convenient for cooperation and can avoid buck-passing. The third is that if cooperation between departments is to be organized, whether it is to use existing or arrange new machine repair workshops, it is best for the State Construction Commission to come forward and organize it, which will be much smoother than direct organization by various industrial departments.
    The two symposiums also discussed how to rationally construct and use central laboratories. More people disagree with the centralized use of central laboratories. However, everyone also pointed out that although there are many problems, it does not mean that cooperation is completely impossible. For example, at least the equipment with very low load can be organized for unified use, because some instruments in some laboratories are very valuable and are often idle in one unit. It is still very beneficial to concentrate them. As for which types of equipment can be cooperated with, further research is needed.

　　怎样集中使用修理车间
　　——化工部、第二机械部技术人员的讨论意见
　　本报记者　顾雷
    合理地建设和使用修理车间，是件很复杂的事情，涉及到几百或几千个企业。这个问题解决得好，可以给国家节省大量资金。本报曾为此发表了社论和文章，提出应加强企业间这方面的协作。同一地区如果已有可资利用的机械修理工厂，新建的企业就可以不再修建；多建了的应该安排其他用途，或把设备调出；在新的工业区，可以考虑建立中心机械修理厂。
    报纸提出的这个问题，引起了许多技术人员的注意。化学工业部、第二机械工业部的五十多名技术人员，自动组织座谈会，研究了解决这个问题的方法。在两次座谈会上，大家认为本报提出这个问题是重要的、及时的。但是，有些人认为本报提出的一些意见中，如少建、不建等，结论作得太早，是不慎重的，容易给实际工作带来困难。因为有许多问题需要具体研究，例如修理车间的任务究竟是什么？是否可以少建，怎样才能少建？怎样组织企业间的协作？修理车间集中或分散，各有哪些利弊？各企业的产品性质不一样，是否应该有区别地对待这个问题？大家对这些问题展开了讨论，大都还没有取得一致的意见。现将讨论中的两方面的意见整理出来，供关心这件事的人参考。
    修理车间的任务究竟是什么？
    各企业，特别是有些新建企业的修理车间所以大，是因为它负担的任务太重。
    在讨论如何确定修理车间任务的时候，有三种意见。
    一种意见认为，我国机械工业有很大发展，可以比过去供应基本建设、生产检修更多的设备。这就有条件把修理车间的任务控制在检修范围内，通过协作去取得检修时需要的部件，这样就可以大大缩小修理车间的规模。
    另一种意见认为，修理车间保持相当的制造能力仍然必要，不这样便无法保证顺利进行生产。因为每个生产企业性质不同，有通用的设备也有特殊的设备，检修时所需要的设备数量虽不太多，却很零碎，不易订货，即便订到货也不容易及时拿到手，不同意断然缩小修理车间的规模。
    再一种意见认为，谈修理车间的规模大小，要看能够协作的部件多少而定。在一般情况下，可以压缩通用件的制造能力，非标准设备仍应由自己制造。但是，同时要看到我国机械设备标准化工作还很落后，在这种情况下如何组织通用件的协作，仍然是应该慎重考虑进行的，不能太急。
    总之，有人趋向于积极采取措施缩小修理车间，也有人面有难色，但都希望领导机关迅速研究这个问题。
    哪些工种应该集中？
    大家讨论修理车间能不能集中的时候，一致的意见是应首先考虑哪些工种能够集中、哪些工种不宜集中，然后才能具体地比较利弊。
    企业里的修理车间包括很多工种，从大的方面说，一部分是制造的，另一部分是修理（钳工等）的。再细分一下，除了机修车间外，还有些特殊的工种，如炼油、化工厂里的铆焊工段等。
    因此，修理车间的集中与协作主要是制造备件的部分，而不是检修（钳工）力量。每个企业，依然要留下足够保证完成检修任务的检修工人。这有很多好处。一个工厂里的检修工人不仅要在大修时更换某些设备，而且负担日常维护检修、及时排除设备故障的任务。这些人熟悉本厂设备情况，可以提高检修效率，保证检修质量，降低检修成本。
    修理车间的集中，在一般情况下只适用于机修车间，不应包括特殊的工种。例如，在一个地区里如果只有一个炼油厂，其他都是机器厂，炼油厂铆焊工段的任务是检修或加工各种大型容器，其他工厂很少使用这个工种，集中了反而增加了一道手续。但是，如果在一个地区里有几个同类的企业，特殊工种也还是可以考虑集中使用的。
    大家的意见基本是一致的，认为目前应着重考虑机修车间的建设、使用的问题。
    怎样集中？
    座谈会上，大家谈的最多的是怎样统一调配、组织协作、合理建设和利用机修车间的问题。共有七种意见。
    第一种，取消企业的机修车间，在一个地区内建立中心机修厂，供应各企业检修时需要的设备部件。提这个意见的人，认为这样做的优点是：可以减少设备重复和闲置的现象，能组成较强的加工能力，便于合理地调配技术力量和加强技术管理，节省工卡具，容易平衡生产能力，减少窝工。
    有人反对这种做法，理由是：一个地区有很多企业，性质又不相近，强求集中了，中心修理厂的规模要相当大，不易安排、平衡生产计划。另外，由谁来领导、谁来设计、谁来建设？这些问题都不是马上可以解决的。
    第二种，在一个地区内，把生产性质相似的企业的修理车间统一组织起来，建立一个修理厂。这样做的好处是：由于生产性质相近，不仅可以统一机修能力，还可以统一其他的工种；不仅通用件可以协作，特殊部件也有了通用性，便可以集中特殊设备，减少设备费用；也易于安排检修备品的生产计划。
    反对这种做法的理由有两个：一个，这个修理厂由谁领导？这几个企业属于一个部门还好办，如果属于两个以上的部门，以谁为主，怎样保证不发生本位主义的现象呢？另一个，如果这几个企业的机修能力并不大，可以不必增加这层麻烦。
    第三种，以大带小，即在一个地区里由一个机修车间大的企业，去统几个小企业已有的机修车间，或者某些小企业不再建设或扩大机修车间，然后统一安排任务。
    这个意见遭到不少人的反对，认为虽然可能有某些节省，却是一种复杂的配合关系。其中最大的问题是，小企业经常要去求助于大企业，而大的企业也不愿意有这种管理上的麻烦；在检修任务紧张的时候，容易发生不易解决的矛盾。
    第四种，各厂机修车间只保留供应中小修时所用部件的加工能力，把大修时制造部件的力量拿出去，组成中心修理厂，或者外出订货。因为大修时，要调换很多设备，委托给中心修理厂更合适，免得自己虽然准备了大检修的能力，而大修时又不能完全把活包下来。
    这也有不同的意见，认为这样做还没有解决中心修理厂如何建立、如何进行生产的问题，在设备利用上也不一定很经济。例如，大修或中修时，需要同一种特殊设备制造部件，即使把大修的活分出去，还是要装一台或几台特殊设备，其利用率一定不高。
    第五种，各企业的机修车间只保留检修标准件的加工能力，把非标准件的制造任务分出去。根据许多机修车间的情况，平常窝工最多的，是制造非标准件的某些特殊设备，因此可以按工业部的系统建生产非标准设备的机修厂，或在一个地区组织这样的工厂，是能够减少特殊设备费用的。
    有人认为不可以这样做。根据过去经验，耽误检修工作的，往往是非标准设备而不是标准设备，因此工厂应保留非标准设备的制造能力，把标准设备的制造能力分出去。
    第六种，觉得目前这方面的意见不一致，困难很多，又没有经验，最好是先在一个地区内，把属于同一个工业部又毗邻的两三个企业组织起来协作，研究一下协作的问题，然后加以推广。这样，免得搞得太急而妨碍生产。在第二机械工业部的座谈会上，大多数人同意这个意见。
    第七，个别同志的意见是，机修车间不能集中，还是自己有才方便。这个意见，在会上没有人赞成。
    对三个问题有一致看法
    上述意见虽然不一致，但有三个问题却取得了一致的看法。一个是，如果要搞中心修理厂，最好是由地方上领导，既可以防止发生本位主义，还可以同地方上其他机修力量统一安排任务。另一个是，如果组织小范围的协作，最好以一个工业部为单位调整，这样便于协作，也可以免去扯皮之苦。再一个是，如果要组织部与部之间的协作，不管是利用原有的还是安排新建的机修车间，最好由国家建设委员会出面组织，这会比由各工业部直接组织顺利得多。
    两次座谈会还讨论了如何合理地建设和使用中心实验室的问题。不同意集中使用中心实验室的人比较多。但是，大家也提出，尽管问题很多，不等于完全不可以进行协作。例如，至少可以组织负荷很低的设备统一使用，因为目前有些实验室里的仪器非常贵重，放在一个单位里常常闲着，能集中起来，还是大有好处的。至于究竟哪些种设备可以协作，尚待进一步研究。
