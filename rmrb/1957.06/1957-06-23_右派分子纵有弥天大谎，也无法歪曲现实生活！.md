Rightists, With All Their Lies, Cannot Distort Real Life!
    After reading in the newspaper the anti-Party, anti-socialist speeches of people like Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, and Huang Xinping, all of us stone carvers are extremely indignant! Let these rightists look at the facts and listen to the voices of the vast numbers of handicraftsmen!
    Qingtian stone carving has a long history of seven hundred years and is well-known at home and abroad, but this is a history of poverty and suffering. Before liberation, stone carvers suffered all kinds of devastation and tasted enough bitterness, especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the oppression of bureaucrats, and the exploitation of landlords and capitalists. Not only were we unable to make a living, but even the stone carving industry was on the verge of bankruptcy and almost disappeared. By the eve of liberation, our workforce had decreased from more than 1,000 people to more than 100, and there was not a single professional. Many artisans were forced to change careers, and many people left their hometowns and drifted to other places. After liberation, the Communist Party sent cadres to guide us on the road of cooperation and tried every means to open up sales channels for us. In this way, our stone carving industry has been developed again. Now there are four production cooperatives in the county, with 525 members and an annual output value of 330,000 yuan. Since then, all members have gotten rid of poverty and started to live a prosperous life. In the past, many people wore patched clothes, but now everyone wears new clothes. Many members have also built houses. Two cooperatives have also implemented free medical care. In addition, the cooperatives have also universally organized cultural, recreational, sports, and welfare undertakings, and people who are half a century old can also read and write. All of this, for us, was something we never dared to think about or dream about in the past.
    The contrast between the old and new societies is so obvious that rightists, with all their lies and the ability to slander to the extreme, cannot distort it. We handicraftsmen have already regarded the cooperative as our lifeblood and compared the Communist Party to our parents. We are determined to follow the Communist Party and resolutely take the road of socialism.

### 右派分子纵有弥天大谎，也无法歪曲现实生活！

　　右派分子纵有弥天大谎，也无法歪曲现实生活！
    从报上读到章伯钧、储安平、葛佩琦、黄心平之流的反对党的领导反对社会主义的言论后，我们全体石雕从业者感到极大的愤慨！让这些右派分子看看事实，听听广大手工业者的声音吧！
    青田石雕有七百年的悠久历史，闻名国内外，可是这是一段贫困痛苦的历史。解放前石雕艺人受尽摧残，尝够苦楚，特别是国民党反动统治时代，官僚的压迫，地主资本家的盘剥，不但榨得我们不能生活，连石雕业也濒于破产，几乎湮灭。到解放前夕，我们的从业人员由一千余人减少到一百余人，而且没有一个专业人员。许多艺人被迫转业改行，许多人背乡离井流落他乡。解放后，共产党派来干部引导我们走合作化道路，千方百计地替我们打开销路。这样，我们石雕业又得到发展。现在全县有四个生产合作社，社员有五百二十五人，年产值达三十三万元。从此，全体社员摆脱了贫困，开始过富裕的生活。过去许多人穿的是百补衣，现在人人穿新衣。不少社员还修盖了房子。两个社还实行了公费医疗。此外，社里还普遍举办了文娱体育福利事业，上了半百年纪的人也能念书认字。所有这些，对我们来说，过去是想也不敢想、梦也梦不到的。
    新旧社会对比是这样明显，右派分子纵有弥天大谎极尽诬蔑的本领，也是歪曲不了的。我们手工业者已经把合作社看成自己的命根子，把共产党比做自己的爹娘，我们坚决跟共产党走，坚决走社会主义的道路。
