    Insisting American Ships Have the Right to Navigate the Gulf of Aqaba
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 25th – According to a report in "The People's News" on June 24th, the United States is supplying Israel with weapons on a large scale, seeking to turn it into an outpost base for the United States in the Middle East. The newspaper pointed out that this is another step in the entire American conspiracy to oppose Arab nationalism.
    The news was reported by this newspaper, citing sources close to the Lebanese government. The newspaper said that the weapons supplied by the United States directly and indirectly through its NATO allies to Israel include twenty-eight Sherman tanks, twelve anti-tank guns and many anti-aircraft guns, heavy mortars and rocket launchers. In addition, the United States also supplied Israel with two destroyers, several torpedo boats and other warships, as well as a large number of military aircraft. These heavy weapons and ammunition were shipped to Israel in January and March of this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 25th – The United States State Department spokesman said on the evening of June 23rd that the State Department has notified American shipping companies that it believes American ships have the right to "free and innocent passage" in the Gulf of Aqaba.
    The State Department spokesman said that the United States considers the Gulf of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran to be international waterways.
    It is known that the Gulf of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran are territorial waters of Arab countries, and Arab countries have repeatedly stated their sacred sovereignty over this region.
    An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on June 24th, warmly welcoming the statement by the U.S. State Department spokesman.

　　在中东设立前哨基地
    美国供给以色列大批武器
    硬说美国船有权航行亚喀巴湾
    新华社开罗25日电  据“人民报”6月24日报道，美国正在大规模地把武器供给以色列，要使它变成美国在中东的前哨基地。报纸指出，这是美国反对阿拉伯民族主义的整个阴谋中的又一个步骤。
    这个消息是这家报纸援引接近黎巴嫩政府人士的话报道的。报纸说，美国直接和通过北大西洋公约组织的盟国间接供给以色列的武器，包括二十八辆薛尔曼式坦克、十二门反坦克炮和许多高射炮、重迫击炮和火箭筒。此外，美国还供给以色列两艘驱逐舰、若干鱼雷艇和其他军舰，还有大量的军用飞机。这些重型武器和弹药是在今年1月和3月运到以色列的。
    新华社25日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人6月23日晚上说，美国国务院已经通知美国各轮船公司，它认为美国船只有权在亚喀巴湾“自由地和无害地航行”。
    国务院发言人说，美国认为亚喀巴湾和蒂朗海峡是国际水道。
    大家知道，亚喀巴湾和蒂朗海峡是阿拉伯国家的领水，阿拉伯国家曾经一再申述过它们对这个地区的神圣主权。
    以色列外交部发言人在6月24日发表谈话，对美国国务院发言人的谈话表示热烈的欢迎。
