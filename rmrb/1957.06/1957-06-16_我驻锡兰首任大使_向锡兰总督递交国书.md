Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 15th. Zhang Canming, the first Chinese Ambassador to Ceylon, presented his credentials to the Governor-General of Ceylon, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, on the morning of June 14th.

    When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Zhang Canming delivered a eulogy to Governor-General Goonetilleke, saying that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon would promote the development of friendly relations between the two countries. This development is in line with the common interests and common aspirations of our two peoples, and will also help the friendship and unity of Asian and African countries, and help consolidate world peace.

    Ambassador Zhang Canming said that because both of our countries have achieved independence and are determined to defend world peace, it is possible to restore the long-standing friendly relations between our two countries that were severed by the colonialists. He said that the smooth implementation of the trade agreement between the two countries and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Ceylon have strengthened this friendship.

    In his reply, Governor-General Goonetilleke welcomed the Chinese Ambassador and predicted that the trade negotiations to be held in Beijing would be successfully concluded. He said that the trade agreement signed between Ceylon and China five years ago was very important and the implementation has been very satisfactory.

    Governor-General Goonetilleke said that Ceylon was the first country to break through the obstacles of reactionary forces to trade with China, and it had been under great pressure from all sides. He said that he was very pleased that many countries are now emulating Ceylon in trading with China. He asked the Chinese Ambassador to convey his regards to Premier Zhou.
