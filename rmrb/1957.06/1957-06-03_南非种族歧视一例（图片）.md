    An Example of Racial Discrimination in South Africa
    The "whites" of the Union of South Africa treat the local indigenous people worse than livestock. The chair in this public place is marked in English: "For Europeans Only." The Union of South Africa has also passed many racially discriminatory laws, such as the Group Areas Act, the Native Trust and Land Act, the Group Areas Act, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, etc.

    南非种族歧视一例
    南非联邦的“白人”对当地土著居民不如对待畜生。这个公共场所的椅子上用英文写着：“只许欧洲人用”。南非联邦还通过了许多歧视种族的法律，如种族隔离法、土著迁移法、特定住区法、异族通婚法等等。
