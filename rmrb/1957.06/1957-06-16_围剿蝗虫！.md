　　Encircle and Suppress Locusts!
    "Locusts are attacking the great agricultural harvest!" This is the emergency signal issued by the Hebei Daily editorial on June 14 to farmers across the province.
    The editorial stated: Last autumn, our province suffered from floods, leaving many residual locusts. Furthermore, 6.8 million mu of wheat fields were cultivated using rough sowing and plowing methods, and weeds in the fields were not cleared, resulting in a large number of overwintering locust eggs. Consequently, a large-scale locust outbreak has occurred this year. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, by June 12, locusts had been found on 2.21 million mu of land (the actual area is likely much larger). In most areas, the locust nymphs were already in their third or fourth instar when they were discovered, and locust nymphs will transform into flying locusts after the fifth instar. Therefore, we must quickly mobilize to eradicate the locusts.
    The current slow progress in locust control is due to the fact that the areas with the most locusts are also in the midst of the intense wheat harvest season. The wheat harvest is, of course, extremely important, but if we delay locust control until after the wheat harvest, it will be too late. Some people are requesting that the state send more airplanes and tractors for locust control, but due to various limitations, we cannot solely rely on airplanes and tractors. The main solution is to organize the masses for eradication.
    The editorial pointed out that the most effective method for eradicating locusts is to organize large-scale encirclement and annihilation campaigns, which requires the joint efforts of the broad masses in a region. According to calculations by agricultural technology departments, if 30,000 people are mobilized to use both chemical and mechanical methods, 300,000 mu can be treated in one day, with an insecticidal efficiency of 90%. Under normal circumstances, a second treatment is not required. However, currently, many regions are fighting "guerrilla warfare" in locust control, and the effect is too small.
    To improve locust control efficiency, in addition to organizing large-scale operations, we should also do a good job in locust situation reconnaissance. This is an important prerequisite for taking the initiative and timely elimination. Some areas lack equipment, but the masses can be organized to manufacture stretcher-type powder sprayers and airplane-type powder sprayers. These tools are simple to manufacture and highly efficient in pest control.
    The editorial warned that this is a critical moment. A slight setback in our work could lead to the danger of locusts taking flight, and the farmlands harmed would not be just a few million mu, nor would it be just a problem for one province. Let us take all emergency measures to prevent the locusts from taking flight!

### 围剿蝗虫！

　　围剿蝗虫！
    “蝗虫向农业大丰收进攻了！”这是6月14日河北日报社论向全省农民发出的紧急信号。
    社论说：去年秋天我省遭受了水灾，残蝗很多，去年又有六百八十万亩麦田是潺耩、犁种的，田间杂草没有清理，留下越冬蝗卵较多，因此，出现了今年蝗虫大量发生的局势。据省农业厅统计，到6月12日发现蝗虫的面积达二百二十一万亩（实际恐远不止这些），其中大部分地区是在蝗蝻达三、四龄时才发现的，而蝗蝻到五龄以后就变成了飞蝗。因此，要迅速动员起来扑灭蝗虫。
    当前治蝗进度迟缓的原因，在于蝗虫较多的新蝗区，正逢麦收紧张的季节。麦收当然十分重要，但拖到麦收后再治蝗虫就来不及了。有些人要求国家多派飞机和拖拉机治蝗，但由于各种条件的限制，我们不能单纯依赖飞机和拖拉机治蝗，主要应组织群众除治。
    社论指出，除治蝗虫最有成效的方法是组织大规模的围歼战，这就需要一个地区的广大群众联合除治。据农业技术部门计算，若发动三万群众使药械联合除治，一天即可除治三十万亩，杀虫效率达90％，在一般情况下不用治第二次。但是，目前在除治蝗虫工作中，许多地区多是打“麻雀战”，治蝗效果太小了。
    提高治蝗效率，除了组织大兵团作战外，还应作好蝗情的侦察工作，这是争取主动及时消灭的重要前提。有些地区器械不足，可组织群众制造担架式喷粉器和飞机式喷粉器。这些工具制造方法简单，治虫效率又高。
    社论警告说，现在正是紧急关头，工作中稍有失利，蝗虫就有起飞的危险，那时危害的农田就不只是几百万亩，也不是一个省的问题。让我们采取一切紧急措施，不让蝗虫起飞！
