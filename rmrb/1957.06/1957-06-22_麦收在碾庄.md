　　Wheat Harvest in Nianzhuang
　　Shi Yue'e, Zhang Jing

　　Just as the wheat harvest was in full swing in northern Jiangsu, we arrived at a small market town - Nianzhuang.
　　Here, the ripe, golden wheat shimmered dazzlingly in the sunlight, the heavy ears bowing and swaying in the wind. Walking along the paths between the fields felt like being on a large ship in a sea of wheat, moving with the waves. Entering the village, we were surprised by the quiet. We ran all over the small street but couldn't find a single cadre, or even see anyone. It turned out they were all in the fields.
　　Unable to find any cadres, we had no choice but to go to the fields ourselves to take a look.
　　We walked north to the end of the street, where a field of wheat was already half harvested. Nearly twenty women, wearing straw hats and bending over, cut the stalks of wheat with their sharp sickles close to the ground, rarely dropping a single ear of wheat. After the wheat was cut, it was immediately bundled and put on carts, which were pushed by male commune members to the threshing ground. Right behind them, several male commune members came along with three-legged harrows, sowing bean seeds in the harvested wheat fields. Over at the threshing ground, people were also working hard, chopping, sunning, threshing, and winnowing. It all seemed well-organized, each process like a thread running through them. We stood and watched for a long time, wanting to jump in and ask a few questions, but we couldn't find anyone who could stop and talk to us.
　　In another place, we finally found Wei Shigui, the leader of the first team of the first production brigade of the Nianzhuang Agricultural Cooperative. We asked him about this year's wheat harvest, and he grinned as soon as he answered, smiling and saying, "This year is much better than last year. We haven't had such good wheat ears since liberation, the ears are long, and the grains are big. We farmers have a saying about good harvests: 'Three thousand for rice, sixty for wheat.' If an ear of wheat can grow sixty grains, it's an incredible good year." "So, how many grains are there in an ear this year?" we asked. "Ha! The 'Bima No. 1' we planted has at least sixty grains, and some have seventy. In the past, an ear of wheat had three or four rows, but this year there are five or six rows. Last year, a grain of wheat was thin and small like sesame, but this year! From top to bottom, the grains are full, almost bursting out!" We asked again, "How much do you think this year's yield will increase?" Wei Shigui held up two fingers and said, "At least 20%." His confident tone and excited expression immediately infected us; just as we were about to continue asking questions, Wei Shigui no longer had time to talk to us.
　　While chatting with commune members at the edge of the field, everyone felt that the freshest thing was that the cooperative and team cadres went to the fields to produce, solving problems while working. Therefore, this year's wheat harvest was timely, and the quality was also good. The commune members of the first production team told us these two things:
　　One afternoon, Li Mingzhi, the leader of the seventh team, and Cao Peihao, the deputy leader of the team, started arguing at the edge of the field. Li Mingzhi insisted that everyone go and harvest the remaining forty mu of barley and peas, arguing that the barley and peas were about to shed their grains, and if they didn't hurry, they would suffer losses. Cao Peihao insisted on taking the commune members to harvest the wheat, arguing that the commune members were waiting for the wheat to make pancakes. The two argued for a long time, and neither would give in. The commune members had no choice but to rest by the field and wait for work assignments. At this time, Zhang Zhaoxiang, the brigade leader, happened to come down to the field to produce, and when he saw this situation, he first listened for a while, got a sense of the situation, and then went up to let the two explain their reasons. After they finished speaking, Zhang Zhaoxiang sat on the edge of the field and discussed it with the commune members. After he clearly calculated the losses from not harvesting the barley in time, the commune members immediately accepted the assignment from the team leader Li Mingzhi. The deputy team leader Cao Peihao knew he was wrong and no longer insisted on his own opinion. The commune members harvested all forty mu of barley and peas in one afternoon. When the team leader and deputy team leader met on the way back, they both laughed.
　　Another time, Zhang Zhaoxiang went to the fifth team to cut wheat. He found that everyone was not paying attention to the quality of the wheat cutting. He paid special attention to the wheat cut by team member Zhou Wencheng. The wheat roots were left very long, and the broken wheat behind him was scattered all over the ground. He immediately suggested a temporary break. During the break, he picked up a handful of wheat roots from the ground and said to everyone, "Look, this handful of wheat stalks is more than four inches long. It's a pity to leave it in the ground. Don't forget the days when we had difficulty burning grass last year, even in a good year!" These words touched an old farmer next to him, and he immediately added, "The brigade leader is right. It's too wasteful to cut wheat like this." He then counted on his fingers: if each wheat plant harvests four inches less straw, each mu of land would lose at least forty jin, and the entire team of more than three hundred and ninety mu of wheat would lose more than fifteen thousand jin; if each mu of land scatters two sheng of wheat, each household would lose eighty jin. Once this account was calculated, everyone immediately understood. Zhou Wencheng, who had the worst work quality, also felt very ashamed and took the initiative to examine himself, saying, "This time, my thinking was not right. I saw that the wheat field was uneven and didn't want to damage the blade of my new sickle by cutting too deep. I didn't realize that it would lose so much grain and straw!" This break was very effective. When they cut wheat again, the wheat stalks were level with the ground, not a single ear of wheat was scattered, clean and neat, almost like it had been planed.
　　The next day, we finally saw Comrade Xu Zechang, the director of the cooperative. As soon as we met, we said, "It's really not easy to find you, the director!" He said, "Yes, in previous years, the busier it was, the more I couldn't leave the office. This year is better. The cooperative cadres go to the fields in separate groups and produce side by side with the commune members, and the leadership is much more practical. It's a good thing that you can't find the cadres." According to him, the Nianzhuang cooperative suffered a particularly severe flood last year. Wheat, sweet potatoes, and corn all failed, and the disaster was very serious. Now, every household has eaten new wheat pancakes, and the famine has passed. The cooperative has 16,000 mu of wheat. It was originally estimated that the yield per mu would be 100 jin. Judging from the 7,000 mu that have already been harvested, the average yield per mu of wheat in the cooperative this year can exceed 130 jin. The ration originally determined to be distributed to the commune members was 95 jin, but now it can be greatly exceeded.

　　麦收在碾庄
　　史越峨　张竞
    正当江苏北部麦收紧张的时节，我们来到了一个小集镇——碾庄。
    在这里，熟透了的金黄色的小麦，在阳光下闪着耀眼的光采，重甸甸的穗头在风中低头摇摆。从田间的小路走过去，就像置身在麦海中的一只大船上，傍着麦浪在移动。进入庄里，出乎意外的冷清。跑遍了那条小街，连一个干部的影子也没有找到，也看不见什么人。原来都下地去了。
    找不到干部，我们只好也下地去看看。
    我们向北一直走到街尽头，这里有一块麦地已经割了一半。近二十个妇女带着斗笠、弯着腰，一把把麦秆在她们锋利的镰刀下齐地割断，很少有一颗麦穗撒在地上。麦子割下来以后，随即打成捆，放到车上，由男社员推到打麦场上去。紧跟着，又有几个男社员拉着三腿耩子走过来，在割好的麦地上播好豆种。那边麦场上，人们也在紧张地劳动，铡的铡，晒的晒，打的打，扬的扬。看上去，一切都安排得很有条理，一道道工序，真像有一根线穿着似的。我们站着看了半天，几次想插进去问问话，竟找不到一个可以停下来和我们讲话的人。
    在另一个地方，好容易找到了碾庄农业社第一生产队第一小队长魏世贵。我们问他今年麦收的情况，他一答话就嘻开了嘴，笑着说：“今年比去年强多了，解放以后从没有长得像今年这样好的麦穗，穗子长，粒子又大。我们农民看丰收有句俗话叫：谷三千，麦六十。一个麦穗要是能长六十粒麦子，就是了不起的好年成了。”“那么，今年一个麦穗有多少粒？”我们问。“哈！我们小队种的‘碧蚂一号’，少的在六十，多的到七十。过去一个麦穗三、四排，今年有五、六排。去年一颗麦子精瘦精细像芝麻一样，今年呀！从下到上粒粒饱满，简直就要挤得炸出来了！”我们又问：“你看今年能增产多少？”魏世贵叉着两个手指说：“至少20％。”他那充满信心的语调和兴奋的神色，一下也感染了我们；正想继续发问，可是魏世贵已经没有功夫陪我们谈下去了。
    在田边和社员们闲谈当中，大家感到最新鲜的事，就是社、队干部下地生产，一边干活，一边解决问题，因此，今年麦收及时，质量也好。第一生产队的社员告诉了我们这样两件事：
    一天下午，第七小队的小队长李明志和小队副曹培浩两人在田边吵开了。李明志坚持要大家去收割剩下的四十亩大麦和豌豆，理由是大麦和豌豆快要脱粒，不抢收怕受损失。曹培浩却一定要带社员去割小麦，理由是社员们等着小麦做煎饼。两个人争了好半晌，谁也不服谁。社员们只好在地边歇着等分配工作。这时，恰好大队长张兆祥下地来生产，看到这情景，他先在旁边听了一会，摸到了几分底，随即走上去让两个人申述他们的道理。等他们说完，张兆祥就坐在田边，和社员们共同研究。当他把不及时收割大麦的损失账算清了以后，社员们当场就接受了小队长李明志的分配。小队副曹培浩自知理缺，也不再坚持自己意见。社员们在一个下午就把四十亩大麦和豌豆都收割完了。回来时，小队长和小队副见面都笑了起来。
    还有一次，张兆祥到第五小队去割麦。他发现大家不讲究割麦的质量。他特别注意队员周文成割的麦子，麦根留得很长，身后的碎麦撒了一地。他当时就建议临时休息一下。趁休息的当儿，他顺手在地里拔起一把麦根，对大家说：“你们看看，这把麦秆还有四寸多长，留在地里多可惜，好年成可不要忘了我们去年烧草困难的日子呀！”这句话，正触动了旁边一个老农，他马上接上来说：“大队长说的是，像这样割麦太浪费了。”他又扳起指头来算了一笔账：每棵麦子如少收四寸麦草，每亩田至少要损失四十斤，全小队三百九十多亩麦，就要损失一万五千多斤；一亩地如撒掉二升麦子，每户人家就要损失八十斤。这笔账一算，大家顿时都明白过来了。干活质量最差的周文成也感到很惭愧，当时就主动检讨说：“这一回是我思想不正，我因为看到麦地高低不平，舍不得自己这把新镰刀，怕割深了碰坏刀口，没有想到会损失这么多粮草！”这一趟休息很有作用，再割麦时，麦草齐地平，麦穗一根不撒，干净利落，简直像刨过的一样。
    第二天，我们好容易看到社主任徐则昌同志。一见面，我们就说：“要找你这个主任真不容易呀！”他说：“是呀，往年越到忙的时候越走不开办公室，今年可好了，社干部分头下地和社员并肩生产，领导可实际得多了，你们找不到干部还是一件好事哩。”据他说，碾庄社去年遭受了特大的水涝灾害，小麦，山芋，玉米样样失收，灾情很严重。现在，家家户户已经吃到了新麦煎饼，灾荒已经度过了。全社的小麦一万六千多亩，原来估计单产一百斤，从已收割的七千亩看来，全社今年小麦的单位产量平均可以超过一百三十斤，本来确定分给社员的口粮是九十五斤，现在可以大大超过了。
