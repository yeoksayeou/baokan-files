　　As people who have lived through decades of oppression by the three great enemies in old China, enduring poverty and backwardness, we have witnessed our nation and people in a precarious state, causing us deep anxiety. Finally, we have waited for the working class vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, to liberate the people of the whole country, leading us in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The face of society has greatly changed, the lives of the people have greatly improved, and the country's status has greatly risen. How can each of us, with a little patriotism and conscience, not sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party? Most of us in the industrial and commercial sectors have such understanding and feelings. However, there are a few who do not think so. They always feel that socialism is not as good as capitalism, and the working class is not as good as the bourgeoisie. Most of us want to destroy capitalism and establish socialism; they want to destroy socialism and establish capitalism. Zhang Naiqi is a concentrated representative of this reactionary stance.

　　I. The Essence and Harmfulness of Zhang Naiqi's Fallacies.

　　The essence of Zhang Naiqi's fallacies is anti-socialist. He claims to support socialism and oppose dogmatism, and he claims to encourage the industrial and commercial sectors to overcome their inferiority complex and give full play to their initiative. However, his real intention is to undermine socialism secretly, to promote the passive and backward side of the industrial and commercial sectors, to frustrate their positive and progressive side, to make them lose confidence and determination in accepting transformation, and to pull them back to the old road of capitalism. He knows that the industrial and commercial sectors are most afraid of hearing words such as "exploitation," "transformation," "dual character," "working class leadership," and "class relations," so he says: Fixed interest is not exploitation, but merely unearned income; there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and workers; the industrial and commercial sectors are "unconvinced" on the issue of dual character; saying "complete remoulding" will increase the anxiety of the industrial and commercial sectors; is another "Five-Anti Campaign" going to happen if the dual character still exists; the industrial and commercial sectors cannot actively perform their duties in joint ventures because of the "side effects" left over from the "Five-Anti Campaign"; class relations should not be regarded as pressure; bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism, and so on. He knows that the industrial and commercial sectors are dissatisfied with certain activists and those who do ideological education work (of course, there are shortcomings in their work), so he attacks them, saying that their support for the Party and socialism is a lie, that they are "dogmatists," or "people who are used to fearing the right and preferring the left." These fallacies have been refuted in my speech at the symposium of national industrial and commercial figures on June 8; in addition, many comrades have also made serious criticisms, which will not be repeated here. In general, Zhang Naiqi, on the one hand, anesthetizes and deceives the industrial and commercial sectors, inducing them to relax transformation, or even think that transformation is not necessary; on the other hand, he instigates and provokes the industrial and commercial sectors, fueling the resistance of some of them to socialism and the working class, with the aim of negating the leadership of the working class and the Party, negating class relations, negating socialist transformation, and thus negating that socialism is a bright road that the Chinese Communist Party is leading the people of the whole country on. This is definitely not a simple issue of personal understanding, but an extremely serious political issue, that is, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. In such a struggle, we are truly infinitely grateful to the Chinese Communist Party! It has led us onto the road of socialism, and now, when rightists such as Zhang Naiqi are trying their best to pull us back onto the road of capitalism, it is also the Communist Party that shouts at us and prevents us from losing our direction. We bourgeois elements have already embarked on the road of socialism, and we are steadily advancing towards the goal of becoming glorious laborers in socialist society. But Zhang Naiqi is doing everything possible to stop us from moving forward, insisting on pulling us back to the road of capitalism, insisting on making us enemies of the people of the whole country. In order to achieve his despicable goal, he does not hesitate to distort the facts and sow discord. Although our level of understanding in the industrial and commercial sectors is not high, we are gradually able to distinguish between a bright future and a dangerous trap. We have already followed the Communist Party through the stage of democratic revolution and basically completed the stage of socialist revolution. We are definitely going to follow the Communist Party to the end! People like Zhang Naiqi cannot stop us from moving forward!

　　II. Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist attempt is doomed to fail in the face of the great power of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party.

　　Zhang Naiqi claims to be a bourgeois theorist, and his central idea is capitalist, which is not surprising. However, today, when the socialist revolution has basically achieved victory, he has issued a theory that harms socialism in his bones, attempting to shift the direction of the industrial and commercial sectors in accepting transformation. This cannot but be said to be a manifestation of his reactionary nature. I have worked with him in the revolutionary cause for many years, and I have a very clear understanding of his true face. He has a strong desire for leadership, he has always been unorthodox and arrogant, looks down on the masses, and is unwilling to be subordinate to others. He is a very difficult person to work with. As long as what others say and do does not conform to his wishes, no matter what the motives of others are, or what the effect of their words and deeds are, he is always unconvinced and always opposes to the end. The greater the achievements of others, the more unconvinced he is. He likes to have more people following him and listening to his instructions. He thinks that he has theoretical cultivation, but he often quotes theories out of context to emphasize his self-righteous views. He thinks that he is very skilled in handling problems, can speak and write well, and can cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand. He firmly grasps the weaknesses of the national bourgeoisie, which are weakness and vacillation, and sees that the Party is carrying out rectification and calling for "blooming and contending," which is an excellent opportunity. He is convinced that he can use it to counterattack those who have always disagreed with his views and have criticized and helped him in the past, and to spread anti-socialist toxins to the industrial and commercial sectors, striving for more people to listen to him and be manipulated by him. According to his own estimation, he will definitely win this struggle and feel proud and elated. Hasn't he always admitted that the industrial and commercial sectors have progressiveness and enthusiasm? He should have known, but did not notice, that the awareness of the industrial and commercial sectors to accept socialist transformation is gradually strengthening, and the situation of being weak and wavering in the face of anti-socialist fallacies may exist, but the industrial and commercial sectors will eventually look forward and move forward, and will never and cannot retreat. He should also have known, but did not notice, that the Party's encouragement of blooming and contending cannot be separated from the socialist criteria and foundation. Zhang Naiqi's estimation this time is completely wrong. He will eventually not be able to take advantage of the weaknesses and vacillations of the industrial and commercial sectors and the Party's rectification opportunity to enjoy a temporary pleasure and realize his own attempt. His two speeches at the symposium on propaganda and education work and the symposium on industrial and commercial transformation guidance work of the Minjian (Democratic National Construction Association) fully exposed the things in the depths of his mind, which gained some temporary backward sympathy, but eventually only made the industrial and commercial sectors have a further understanding of his face and attempt, and made the people of the whole country launch more intense anger at him. The power of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party is great. Zhang Naiqi is clever but made a stupid mistake. Failure is doomed.

　　Zhang Naiqi and I are old comrades-in-arms. I have not forgotten his past contributions to the revolutionary cause. I have not forgotten that our personal friendship is very good. I have not forgotten that in recent years, I have repeatedly given him earnest advice, but I have not received the slightest result, and his bad performance is getting worse. I must not harm the public for personal reasons, and I can no longer condone his anti-socialist mistakes. I wrote this article to expose the essence and harmfulness of his anti-socialist fallacies. I earnestly hope that he can repent. I earnestly hope that the comrades in the national industrial and commercial sectors will open their eyes, firmly stand on the socialist position, distinguish right from wrong, analyze and study his fallacies, criticize them, refute them, and not be fooled by Zhang Naiqi, doing this or that as a captive of Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. We should know that in the past few years, we have made progress and achievements in accepting transformation, which are hard-won, but not consolidated. We must stand up strongly, overcome our weaknesses and vacillations, draw a clear ideological line with Zhang Naiqi, and work harder in order to smoothly go through the transition period and become glorious laborers in socialist society. We should also further trust the Communist Party, bloom as much as possible, contend as much as possible, and help the Party rectify its work, because everything the Party does is for the interests of the people of the whole country.

　　不要上章乃器的当，跟着共产党走到底
　　民主建国会副主任委员　胡厥文
    我们这一辈子的人，几十年来在旧中国身受三大敌人压迫，过着贫困落后的悲苦生活，亲眼看到国家民族处在风雨飘摇当中，忧心如捣。好不容易盼望到工人阶级先锋队中国共产党解放了全国人民，领导我们从事社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业，社会的面貌大大地变化了，人民的生活大大地改善了，国家的地位大大地提高了，我们每一个人，稍有爱国心和良心，怎能不衷心感谢中国共产党呢？我们工商界中大部分人是有这样的认识和心情的。但是也有少数人不是这样，他们总觉得社会主义不如资本主义，工人阶级不如资产阶级。我们大部分人要破资本主义，立社会主义；他们却要破社会主义，立资本主义。章乃器就是这种反动的立场的一个集中的代表者。
    一、章乃器的谬论的实质和危害性。
    章乃器发出的谬论，实质上是反社会主义的。他口口声声拥护社会主义，反对教条主义，口口声声鼓励工商界克服自卑感，发挥积极性；可是他的实际企图则是暗害社会主义，助长工商界消极、落后的一面，挫折他们积极、进步的一面，使他们消失接受改造的信心和决心，拉回他们走资本主义的老路。他知道工商界最怕听“剥削”、“改造”、“两面性”、“工人阶级领导”、“阶级关系”这些字眼，他就说：定息不是剥削，只不过是不劳而获的收入；资产阶级分子与工人没有本质的区别，工商界在两面性问题上“口服心不服”；说“脱胎换骨”会增加工商界的忧虑；说还有两面性，是不是还要来个“五反”；工商界在合营企业里不能积极守职尽责，是“五反”遗留下来的副作用；不能把阶级关系当作压力；官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人等等。他知道工商界对于某些积极分子和做思想教育工作的人心怀不满（当然在他们的工作中不是没有缺点的），便打击他们，说他们拥护党和社会主义是说假话的“违心论”者，是“教条主义者”，或者是“习于怕右过左的人”。对于这些谬论，6月8日我在全国工商界人士座谈会上的发言已加驳斥；此外，不少同志们也做了严肃的批驳，这里不拟赘述。总的说来，章乃器一方面麻醉、欺骗工商界，引诱他们放松改造，乃至认为不需要改造；另一方面，又煽动、挑拨工商界，助长他们当中一部分人对于社会主义和工人阶级的抗拒情绪，目的在于否定工人阶级和党的领导，否定阶级关系，否定社会主义改造，从而否定社会主义是中国共产党领导全国人民正在走的一条光明的道路。这肯定不是一个单纯的个人认识问题，而是一个极其严重的政治问题，也就是社会主义与资本主义两条道路斗争的问题。在这样斗争中，我们对中国共产党真有无穷的感激！它把我们带上社会主义道路，现在当章乃器等右派分子想尽千方百计把我们拉回资本主义道路上去的时候，向我们大喝一声、使我们不致迷失方向的，也是共产党。我们资产阶级分子本来已经走上社会主义的道路，我们正向着社会主义社会光荣劳动者的目标平平稳稳地前进。但是章乃器却用千方百计阻止我们前进，硬要把我们拉回到资本主义的道路上去，硬要我们与全国人民为敌。为了达到他的这种卑鄙的目的，不惜颠倒黑白，挑拨离间。我们工商界认识水平虽然不高，但是什么是光明的前途，什么是危险的陷阱，我们还是逐渐能够辨明的。我们已经跟着共产党经历了民主革命的阶段，基本上走过了社会主义革命这一阶段，我们肯定是要跟着共产党走到底的！章乃器这一类人是阻挡不了我们前进的！
    二、在党领导的全国人民伟大的力量的前面，章乃器反社会主义的企图，一定不能得逞。
    章乃器自命是一个资产阶级理论家，他的中心思想是资本主义的，原不足怪。但是，在社会主义革命基本上取得胜利的今天，他发出怀在骨子里的危害社会主义的理论来，企图转移工商界接受改造的方向，就不能不说是反动本质的表现。我和他在革命事业中共事多年，对于他的本来面目，有很清楚的认识。他有强烈的领袖欲，他一贯地立异鸣高，看不起群众，不甘居人下，是一个很难共事的人。别人说的话、做的事，只要是不符合于他的愿望的，不管别人的动机如何，说话做事的效果如何，他总是不服气，老是反对到底。别人的成绩越大他越不服贴。他最喜欢有更多的人跟在他后面跑，听他的指示办事。他自以为有理论修养，但是，常常断章取义地引用理论来强调他的自以为是的主张。他自以为在问题的处理上技巧很高，能说会写，可以一手掩盖天下人的耳目。他牢牢地抓住民族资产阶级具有软弱性和动摇性的弱点，看出党在整风，在号召“鸣放”，是一个极好的机会，满以为正可利用它对过去一直不同意他的主见，曾经对他进行过批评、帮助的人，实施反击，并对工商界散播反社会主义的毒素，争取更多的人听他的话，受他的摆布。照他自己的估计，他一定可以在这一次斗争中赢得胜利，吐气扬眉。他不是一直承认工商界是有进步性和积极性吗？他应该知道却没有注意到工商界对于接受社会主义改造的觉悟是在逐步加强，站在反社会主义谬论面前软弱无力动摇不定的局面可能是存在的，但工商界终久还是向前看，往前走，绝不会也不可能向后退的。他也应该知道却没有注意到党鼓励鸣放是不能离开社会主义的准则和基础的。章乃器这次的估计完全错误了。他终于不可能利用工商界的软弱性和动摇性的弱点和党整风机会，逞快一时，实现他自己的企图。他两次在民建会宣教工作座谈会和工商改造辅导工作座谈会上大放厥词，充分暴露了自己思想深处的东西，曾得到一些短暂的落后的同情，终久只不过使工商界对他的面目和企图有了进一步的认识，使全国人民对他掀起更激烈的愤怒。党领导的全国人民的力量是伟大的，章乃器自作聪明，做了呆事，失败是注定了的。
    我和章乃器是老战友，我没有忘记他过去对革命事业曾经有过贡献，我没有忘记我们之间的私人交情很好，我也没有忘记近年来，我多次给他热情的诤告，但没有得到丝毫的结果，而他的不良表现正在变本加厉；我决不能以私害公，再对他的反社会主义的过错姑息下去了。我写这篇文章，揭露他的反社会主义谬论的实质和危害性，殷切地盼望他能悔悟过来，我更殷切地希望全国工商界同志们睁开眼睛，坚定地站在社会主义立场上，明辨是非，分析研究他的谬论，批判它，驳斥它，不要上章乃器的当，这样那样地做章乃器谬论的俘虏。我们应该知道，几年以来，我们接受改造有进步，有成绩，得来不易，但是不巩固，我们要坚强地站起来，克服自己的软弱性和动摇性，和章乃器划清思想界限，为着平平稳稳地走过渡时期，变成社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者而加紧努力。我们还应当更进一步的相信共产党，尽量的鸣，尽量的放，帮助党整风，因为党的一切都是为了全国人民的利益的。
