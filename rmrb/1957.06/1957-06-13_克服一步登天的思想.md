　　Overcoming the Thought of Reaching Heaven in One Step
　　Fu Lei
    The vigor and enthusiasm of youth are the most precious things in the world, the driving force behind all construction and creation. Middle-aged people who want to achieve something, whether big or small, must also learn from the young people's fearless courage and optimistic spirit. Cultivating new forces is the responsibility of our generation; however, a gentleman loves others with virtue, and we must encourage and help young people, but at the same time, we cannot condone or spoil them, watching them go astray. Any method that harms out of excessive love must be resolutely opposed.
    Recently, there has been a phenomenon of rather high and widespread impatience among young people: whether in the literary and art circles, the opera circles, or the science and technology circles, some young people are eager for quick success and have a serious mindset of reaching heaven in one step. Some blindly demand help from veteran writers without asking themselves if they meet the conditions for receiving such help. They readily invoke the examples of how Gorky and Lu Xun helped younger generations, demanding that veteran writers revise their manuscripts; it is well known that editorial departments are criticized for returning manuscripts without providing comments. It is also not uncommon for "Meng Ya" (a literary magazine) to receive submissions torn from school notebooks. They only know about the people Gorky and Lu Xun helped, but they don't know that Gorky and Lu Xun also had people they didn't help, and perhaps those they didn't help were even more numerous. Indiscriminate cultivation, regardless of the target, only wastes each other's energy and benefits no one. A friend said: Lu Xun's line "I bow my head and willingly be an ox for the children" has been misunderstood; the children only want to ride on the ox's back forever and never get off. Moreover, who "cultivated" Lu Xun? What kind of "university" was Gorky's "university"? In such a dark era and chaotic society, didn't Lu Xun and Gorky struggle independently? Didn't they find their own methods for studying diligently, rather than being raised by a specific mentor? Some of our young people, however, misunderstand willpower as blind ambition, thinking that as long as I want to be a writer, I can definitely become a writer, without considering their past foundation or being willing to practice diligently. Little do they know how many practice pieces writers, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, have discarded! They write a lot, select rigorously, and publish little. To truly care for young people, this situation is worth raising for everyone's attention.
    In the years since liberation, the educational level of primary and secondary schools has not been high, and students have learned more ideological things and less practical knowledge. Furthermore, as a result of emphasizing teaching methods, teachers have almost chewed the material and fed it to the students, and some lazy students have become indolent, lacking the ability to think independently. While it is good to have young people take the lead during campaigns, some young people often see themselves as reformers, believing that they are perfect and flawless. There was a period when, because of the emphasis on new forces, some young people became arrogant, disrespecting teachers and looking down on the older generation; it was also heard of that they despised language teachers and arbitrarily skipped classes after publishing one or two articles in newspapers and magazines. The examples of labor models and advanced workers have given great encouragement to the people of the whole country, but young people confuse literary creation and scientific research with "finding shortcuts" and rationalization proposals, thinking that it only takes a little cleverness.
    The reasons why some young people are unwilling to bury themselves in hard work and only want to succeed in one fell swoop are certainly more than just the ones mentioned above. It is hoped that schools, the Communist Youth League, parents, and people from all walks of life will thoroughly research the issue, prescribe the right medicine, and guide young people onto the right path. I also suggest:
    1. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League should conduct publicity and education, starting with League members and gradually enlightening young people in general, overcoming arrogance and dependence, requiring them to use their willpower on diligent study, and telling them that aiming too high without being down-to-earth will not lead to success.
    2. The Ministry of Education should instruct universities and middle schools across the country to constantly educate students in this regard, not in the form of campaigns, but to do it deeply and meticulously, as a major project for cultivating the communist youth's morality.

### 克服一步登天的思想

　　克服一步登天的思想
　　傅雷
    青年的朝气与热情是世界上最宝贵的东西，是一切建设、一切创造的原动力。中年人想要或大或小的有点儿成就，也得向青年们学习那种天不怕地不怕的勇气与乐观精神。培养新生力量是我们这一代的责任；可是君子爱人以德，我们要鼓励青年，帮助青年，同时也不能姑息、娇纵他们，眼看他们走上歧路。凡是爱之适以害之的办法，要坚决反对。
    近来有个现象，就是青年的急躁情绪相当高涨，也相当普遍：不论文艺界戏曲界科技界，有些年轻人急于求成，一步登天的思想很严重。有的一味要求老作家帮助，而不问一问自己够不够请人帮助的条件。他们动辄拿了高尔基鲁迅如何帮助后进的大帽子，要老作家改稿；编辑部因为不提意见就退稿，因而受到责难，更是尽人皆知的事。“萌芽”收到课卷上撕下来的投稿也不是个别的。他们只知道高尔基与鲁迅帮助的人，不知道高尔基与鲁迅也有不帮助的人，而不帮助的也许更多。不问对象，一律培养，除了浪费彼此的精力，对谁都没有好处。有位朋友说：鲁迅那句“俯首甘为孺子牛”的诗被误解了，孺子只想永远骑在牛背上，不下来了。而且鲁迅又是哪个“鲁迅”培养出来的？高尔基的“大学”是什么大学？在那样黑暗的时代，混乱的社会，鲁迅与高尔基不是独立奋斗出来的么？不是自己想方法钻研，而不是由某一个师父带大的吗？我们的一部分青年却把意志误解为盲目的野心，以为只要我想做作家就一定能做作家，既不考虑过去的根基，也不愿意刻苦修练。殊不知古今中外的作家，丢掉过多少习作！他们是写得多，挑的严，发表得少。为了真正爱护青年，这种情况值得提出来请大家注意。
    解放几年来，中小学教育水平不高，学生思想性的东西学得多，实际知识学得少。又因为重视教学法的结果，教师们差不多把材料嚼烂了喂给学生，有一些不用功的学生就懒惰起来，缺乏独立思考的能力。搞运动时叫青年带头固然有好处，但有些青年往往因此就以改造者自居，以为自己完满无缺了。有过一个时期，因为强调新生力量，一部分青少年却气焰高涨，不尊敬老师，瞧不起上一代；在报刊上发表了一两篇文章而轻视语文教师，任意旷课的事也时有所闻。劳动模范与先进工作者的实例给了全国人民很大的鼓动，但年轻人把文艺创作与科学研究，和“找窍门”的合理化建议混为一谈，以为只要靠点儿聪明就行。
    造成一部分青年不肯埋头苦干，只想一举成功的原因，一定不止上面所说的几个。希望学校、党团、家长和社会人士一齐来彻底研究，对症下药，导青年于正轨。我还建议：
    一、请团中央进行宣传教育，先从团员开始，逐渐启发一般青年，克服自大与倚赖思想，要求他们把意志用在刻苦学习上面，告诉他们好高骛远而不脚踏实地，是不会成功的。
    二、请教育部指示全国大学中学，经常在这方面教导学生，不要用搞运动的方式，而要深入细致的做去，作为培养共产主义青年道德的一个重大项目。
