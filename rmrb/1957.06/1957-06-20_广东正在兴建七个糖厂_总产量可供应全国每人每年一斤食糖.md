Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 19th: Guangdong Province, which ranks first in the country in sugar production, currently has seven large sugar refineries with a daily crushing capacity of 1,000 to 3,000 tons under intense construction. Among them are the state-owned Nanhai and Zhongshan sugar refineries, with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons, which are the first in China to be designed, manufactured, and installed domestically. Their civil engineering has been completed, and equipment installation is underway, with production expected to begin by the end of this year. The largest domestic Beijie sugar refinery with a daily crushing capacity of 3,000 tons, and several other sugar refineries, will be completed within the next year or two. The seven factories will have a total annual sugar production of 300,000 tons, which can supply the entire country's 600 million people with one jin of sugar per person per year.

In the early days after liberation, Guangdong Province only had a few small-scale, dilapidated sugar refineries, and the output of the 1949-1950 pressing season was only more than 70,000 tons. Now, the province has a total of fifty-seven sugar refineries and more than 10,000 earthen sugar workshops, which produced a total of 410,000 tons of sugar in the most recent pressing season. This is the highest sugar production in Guangdong's history.

　　广东正在兴建七个糖厂
　　总产量可供应全国每人每年一斤食糖
    据新华社广州19日电　糖产量占全国第一位的广东省，目前有七个日榨量一千至三千吨的大糖厂正在紧张兴建中。其中有我国第一次自己设计、制造、安装的日榨两千吨的国营南海、中山糖厂，它的土建工程已经完成，正在进行设备的安装工程，预计在今年年底可以投入生产。国内最大的日榨三千吨的北街糖厂和其他几个糖厂，将在明后年内建成。七个厂的年产糖量共三十万吨，可以供应全国六亿人民每人每年一斤食糖。
    解放初期，广东省只有几家规模很小、设备破旧的糖厂，1949—1950年榨季的产量才只有七万多吨。现在全省共有五十七家糖厂和一万多个土糖作坊，它们在最近这个榨季共生产了四十一万吨糖，这是广东历史上最高的糖产量。
