Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, June 28th: "Burma New Light" reported on June 27th that the news about the United States' intention to turn Burma's Shan State into a U.S. air force base has aroused concern among the Burmese people.

Yangon newspapers on June 26th published this news, which was recently reported by the Indian weekly "Delhi Times." The news also said that a plan to declare Shan State's secession from the Union of Burma had been drafted, and the United States had made contact with certain feudal elements in Shan State in this regard.

Shan State is located in eastern Burma, bordering China (Yunnan Province), Laos, and Thailand. It has a population of approximately 1.8 million and an area of about 56,000 square miles. Shan State currently maintains a feudal system ruled by Sawbwas (chiefs), but the Burmese Federal Government is canceling their feudal powers by providing compensation to the Sawbwas.

According to Yangon newspapers, the Shan State United Party, composed of some Sawbwas, passed a resolution at a meeting held in Mongyai last December, demanding Shan State's secession from the Union of Burma. Currently, the Shan State Sawbwas are holding a meeting in Taunggyi (the meeting started on June 17th), and it is said that the Sawbwas participating in the Shan State United Party are making every effort at the meeting to prevent all Shan State Sawbwas from accepting compensation.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 28th: Cambodian newspaper "Friendship News" reported on the 27th that some Cambodians, Thais, and Americans in Thailand have formed an armed organization called "Issarak," which is currently stationed on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. This organization is spreading rumors and attacking Cambodia's neutral policy. "Unity News" and "Fatherland News" have also reported similar news, and condemned the imperialists for inciting border incidents.

　　美国唆使掸邦脱离缅甸
    柬埔寨报纸指责美国煽动边境事件
    据新华社仰光28日电　“缅甸新光报”6月27日说，关于美国打算把缅甸掸邦变成美国空军基地的消息引起了缅甸人的关心。
    仰光报纸6月26日刊载了印度“德里时代”周刊最近报道的这条消息。这条消息还说，一个宣布掸邦退出缅甸联邦的计划已经草拟出来，美国已经在这方面同掸邦某些封建分子取得联系。
    掸邦位于缅甸东部，同中国（云南省）、老挝和泰国接壤。它的人口约有一百八十万人，面积大约五万六千平方英里。掸邦目前仍旧保持着由土司统治的封建制度，但是缅甸联邦政府正在通过给予土司赔偿的办法来取消他们的封建权力。
    据仰光报纸报道，由部分土司组成的掸邦统一党去年12月在孟耶举行的会议上通过一项决议，要求掸邦退出缅甸联邦。目前，掸邦土司们正在东枝举行会议（会议从6月17日开始），据说参加掸邦统一党的土司们在会议上竭力活动，使掸邦所有土司都不接受赔偿。
    据新华社金边28日电　柬埔寨报纸“友谊报”27日报道，一些柬埔寨人、泰国人和美国人在泰国组成了一个名叫“伊萨拉”的武装组织，目前驻扎在泰国和柬埔寨的边境上。这个组织正在散布谣言，攻击柬埔寨的中立政策。“统一报”和“祖国报”也先后报道了类似的消息，并且谴责帝国主义者煽动边境事件。
