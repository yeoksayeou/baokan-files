　　Kishi Nobusuke Visits the United States
    "Asahi Shimbun" Warns Him Not to Be Fooled
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi left Tokyo tonight for a visit to the United States.

    Before his departure, Kishi Nobusuke made a statement at Haneda Airport, expressing his hope that his visit would "place Japan-U.S. relations on a more solid and lasting foundation of collaboration and cooperation, and contribute to world peace based on the principles of freedom and equality," and "pave the way for a new era of friendly relations between Japan and the United States." Kishi Nobusuke emphasized that the foundation of Japan's diplomacy is "harmonious relations with free countries."

    In an article published in the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" yesterday, Kishi Nobusuke said that he would explain to the United States that expanding trade with China does not mean recognizing the Chinese government. Expanding trade with China "not only helps develop Japan's economy, but is also necessary if the Japanese conservative government is to continue to hold power for a long time and remain stable."

    Japanese public opinion does not place great hopes on Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Washington. Both Kishi Nobusuke and the White House have announced that the Japan-U.S. talks will not resolve specific issues. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that these talks are unlikely to achieve solutions on major issues, including: Japan's trade policy toward China, revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and returning Okinawa to Japan.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" today warned Kishi Nobusuke not to sign any agreements with the United States that might subject Japan to political or military constraints. The newspaper also said that Kishi Nobusuke should not use the issue of military expansion as a means of solving Japan's economic problems, that is, do not use the promise of any military expansion plan as the price for introducing American capital.

　　岸信介前往美国访问
    “朝日新闻”警告他不要上当
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天晚上离开东京前往美国访问。
    岸信介临行时在羽田机场发表谈话，表示希望他这次访问将“把日美关系置于更牢固和更持久的协力和合作的基础上，为建立在自由和平等原则上的世界和平作出贡献”，并且“为日美间的友好关系的新时期铺平道路”。岸信介强调，日本的外交基础是“同自由国家之间的协调关系”。
    岸信介昨天在“日本经济新闻”发表文章说，他将向美国解释：扩大对华贸易并不意味着承认中国政府。扩大和中国的贸易，“不仅有助于发展日本的经济，而且，如果要使日本保守党政府继续长期执政并且保持稳定，这也是必要的。”
    日本舆论界对岸信介的华盛顿之行并不寄予很大希望。岸信介和白宫都已经宣布，这次日美会谈将不解决具体的问题。“读卖新闻”认为，这次会谈不可能在重大的问题上取得解决办法，这些问题包括：日本对中国的贸易政策、修改日美安全条约、把冲绳岛归还日本。
    “朝日新闻”今天警告岸信介不要和美国签订任何可能使日本遭受政治上或者军事上约束的协定。报纸又说，岸信介不要用扩军问题作为解决日本经济问题的手段，这就是说，不要用承诺任何扩军计划作为导入美国资本的代价。
