Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi today issued a joint communiqué in Taiwan with Yu Hung-chun, the "Executive Yuan President" of Chiang Kai-shek.

    The communiqué emphasized that under the current "unstable international situation," it is necessary to "strengthen the unity of the free world to safeguard freedom in Asia." It also stated that both parties agreed that "international problems should be handled in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and it was decided that the two governments would cooperate closely in the United Nations to support the principles of the United Nations Charter."

    Nobusuke Kishi also expressed that Japan wants to "strengthen economic and cultural cooperation" with the Chiang Kai-shek group.

    According to Kyodo News, in the talks, Nobusuke Kishi "expressed sympathy for the fact that mainland China is ruled by communism," and stated that the Japanese government has not considered adopting a "pro-communist or neutral" foreign policy and is prepared to further enhance "friendly relations" with this tottering Chiang Kai-shek group. During the talks, Chiang Kai-shek had asked Japan not to oppose hydrogen bomb tests. However, Nobusuke Kishi, under the strong opposition of the Japanese people who have suffered deeply from atomic weapons, refused on the grounds of "humanitarianism."

    Nobusuke Kishi has already left Taiwan today to return to Japan.

    日蒋发表联合公报
    岸信介同蒋帮拉交情
    据新华社4日讯　日本首相岸信介今天在台湾同蒋介石的“行政院长”俞鸿钧发表了一项联合公报。
    公报强调在目前“不安定的国际情势”下，要“加强自由世界的团结，以保障亚洲的自由”。它还说，双方同意“应以联合国宪章的原则处理国际间的问题，并且决定两国政府在联合国中密切合作以支持联合国宪章的原则”。
    岸信介还表示日本要同蒋介石集团“加强彼此间经济及文化之合作”。
    据共同社说，在会谈中，岸信介曾经“对中国大陆为共产主义所统治一事表示同情”，同时表示：日本政府没有考虑采取“容共或者中立”的外交政策，而且准备进一步增进同这个摇摇欲坠的蒋介石集团的“友好关系”。在会谈中，蒋介石曾经要日本不要反对氢弹试验。但是岸信介迫于深受原子武器之害的日本人民的坚决反对，以“人道立场”为理由拒绝了。
    岸信介已经在今天离开台湾回日本。
