They Gave Their Lives for the People
Nine Communist Party Members and Communist Youth League Members Sacrificed in Flood Prevention
The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Issues a Notice of Commendation

Xinhua News Agency: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on June 9th, commending the eight Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members who gloriously sacrificed their lives in the flood prevention and rescue struggle in late May. The notice called on all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the province to learn from the spirit of the martyrs who bravely sacrificed their lives to protect the lives and property of the people, and suggested that the government and relevant agencies provide compensation to the families of the martyrs.

Among these eight martyrs, four Communist Party members and one Communist Youth League member gloriously sacrificed their lives while repairing the Shima Bridge in Huiyang County. Shima Bridge is an important bridge on the main highway from Zhangmutou to Shantou. On May 23rd, one end of the bridge was washed away by floods, preventing vehicles from passing and posing a risk of complete collapse. The People's Liberation Army stationed nearby sent two trucks and more than 40 soldiers to assist in the repair. After half a day of repair work, the breach in the bridgehead was about to be filled when a new flash flood suddenly arrived. One truck was submerged in the water and could not be driven. The seven people who remained on the truck were unwilling to abandon the vehicle and escape. A surge of floodwater rushed over, overturning both the truck and the people. Except for the two drivers who were rescued, the four Communist Party members, platoon leader Tan Youshan, deputy platoon leader Su Huaide, squad leader Li Wencheng, driver Li Yunfa, and Communist Youth League member Xue Baoji, all gloriously gave their lives. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation Highway Bureau has decided to rename the bridge "Martyrs' Bridge" and has decided to erect a martyrs' monument next to the bridge.

Chen Xing, a Communist Youth League member who gloriously sacrificed his life in the flood prevention struggle, has been posthumously recognized as a model League member by the Communist Youth League Committee of Haifeng County. He was a cadre of the People's Bank of Haifeng County. On the morning of May 23rd, he and other cadres rescued dozens of flood victims in Lianhe Township. At that time, he was soaked to the skin, frozen, and exhausted. When he heard that there was still an elderly woman in her sixties in Wengcuo Village who had not been rescued, he declined the advice of others to rest and immediately found a wooden raft with Wu Shuide, a demobilized soldier, and paddled to rescue the elderly woman. As they helped the elderly woman onto the raft and paddled towards the shore against the flood, the floodwaters suddenly surged, and the vortex where several streams converged made it impossible for the raft to reach the shore. Finally, Chen Xing used all his strength to insert the bamboo pole into the bottom of the water and stood at one end of the raft, supporting it to reach the shore. Just as Wu Shuide was helping the elderly woman ashore, a torrent of floodwater rushed towards the raft, and Chen Xing fell into the floodwaters and was submerged. More than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Haifeng County held a memorial service for Martyr Chen Xing.

Among the martyrs being commended are also Communist Party member and People's Liberation Army soldier Tie Binglin and Communist Youth League member Tang Shixin. In addition to these eight martyrs, Communist Party member Ma Mingqing also gloriously sacrificed his life in the recent flood prevention and rescue efforts.

　　他们为人民献出了生命
　　九名共产党员和共青团员在防洪中牺牲
　　中共广东省委通报表扬
    据新华社讯　中共广东省委员会在6月9日发布通报，表扬在5月下旬的防洪抢险斗争中光荣牺牲的八位共产党员和共青团员。通报号召全省共产党员和共青团员学习烈士们为保卫人民生命财产而英勇献身的精神，并且建议政府和有关机关对烈士家属进行抚恤。
    这八位烈士中有四个共产党员和一个共青团员是在抢修惠阳县的石马桥时光荣牺牲的。石马桥是樟木头到汕头的公路干线上的一座重要桥梁。5月23日，这座桥的一端被洪水冲塌，车辆无法通行，而且有全部被冲垮的危险。驻在附近的解放军派来两辆卡车和四十多名官兵协助抢修。经过半天抢修，桥头决口将要填修好，突然来了新的山洪。一辆卡车浸在水中，无法开动。留在车上的七个人不愿扔下车子逃走，洪峰猛扑过来，卡车和人都被冲翻。除了两个驾驶员被抢救出险外，四个共产党员，排长谭友善、副排长苏怀德、班长李文成、驾驶员李运发和共青团员薛保纪，都光荣地献出了自己的生命。广东省交通厅公路局已决定把这座桥梁改名为“烈士桥”，并决定在桥旁建立烈士纪念碑。
    在防洪斗争中光荣牺牲的共青团员陈兴，已被共青团海丰县委员会追认为模范团员。是海丰县人民银行的干部。5月23日早晨，他曾和别的干部一起在联和乡抢救了几十个灾民出险。当时他全身湿透，又冻又乏。当他听到翁厝村里还有一个六十多岁的老婆婆没有被救出来以后，就谢绝了别人要他休息的劝告，立即和转业军人吴水德一起找来一副木排，撑着赶去救这个老人。当他们把老人扶上木排，迎着洪水朝岸边撑过来时，洪水突然暴涨，几股洪水汇流的旋涡点，使木排无法靠岸。最后陈兴全力把撑排的竹竿直插水底，自己站到木排的一端支撑着让木排靠岸。正当吴水德扶着老人上岸，一股洪流扑向木排，陈兴翻身掉在洪水里淹没了。海丰县各界人民四千多人曾为陈兴烈士举行了追悼大会。
    在被表扬的烈士中，还有共产党员、人民解放军军人铁炳林和共青团员唐仕新。除了这八位烈士外，还有共产党员马鸣庆也在最近的防洪抢险中光荣牺牲。
