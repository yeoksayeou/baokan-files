　　The Question of Party Leadership in Institutions of Higher Education
　　Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University

　　For a relatively long time after liberation, I participated in government and school work as a non-Party intellectual. In the practice of work and theoretical study, I further understood the Party, and at the same time gradually transformed my own old thoughts. I only joined the Party more than a year ago. Because I have mainly participated in the administrative work of Tsinghua University for the past five years, I would like to mainly talk about the issue of Party leadership in institutions of higher education.

　　I. Can the Party Lead Institutions of Higher Education?

　　Judging from the assessment of the achievements of past teaching reforms, the Party can lead institutions of higher education; moreover, institutions of higher education must be led by the Party.

　　One of the issues still being debated regarding the work of institutions of higher education is whether the Party can lead institutions of higher education well. A small number of people deliberately underestimate the achievements since liberation, especially since the 1952 teaching reform, with the aim of showing that the Party cannot lead institutions of higher education well and that systems such as "professors governing the university" should be adopted. Some even advocate that the Party should withdraw from the university! The criterion for judging whether this statement is correct should be based on facts. That is to say, it should be based on the actual situation of the work of institutions of higher education since the teaching reform. There have been many discussions in the past regarding the assessment of the achievements of teaching reform. I think that as long as we objectively analyze it based on the facts, we should admit that the achievements are still the main aspect. The achievements of teaching reform can be examined from two aspects: first, in terms of the number or speed of cultivating talents for the country: in the more than seven years since the founding of the country, universities and colleges across the country have cultivated more than 300,000 graduates for the country. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, the number of engineering graduates in the few years after liberation, including those graduating this summer, is more than 2,800, which is about three and a half times the total number of engineering graduates from the school in the past few decades. This has adapted to the objective needs of the rapid development of the country's socialist industrial construction. Moreover, the number of students enrolled has increased fourfold; the number of teachers has increased more than three and a half times; the number of laboratories has increased more than threefold; and the building area has increased more than twofold. Second, there has also been a considerable improvement in quality. Up to now, with the exception of Harbin Institute of Technology, although the students trained according to the five-year system will not graduate until this summer, and there is no practical evidence of their quality, in the past few years, there have been many practical examples of the performance of graduates from the three-year, four-year, and two-year specialized courses using the new teaching system and new teaching methods, and even students who are still studying, during their production internships, which prove that there has been great progress compared with the past. Of course, there are some shortcomings in the work, such as: there was a certain degree of blindness in the adjustment of departments; the assimilation of Soviet experience was insufficient, which was reflected in the overemphasis on teaching plans and some formalism in the work; there was also a certain degree of blindness in the development plan; and the cultivation of students' independent work ability in some aspects was not enough. However, these shortcomings cannot change the basic assessment of the achievements. Naturally, the Party also has many shortcomings in its leadership work, but the current question is: Based on past facts, is it necessary for the Party to overcome these shortcomings and strengthen its leadership in order to do a better job in institutions of higher education? Or should we weaken the Party's leadership, or even ask the Party to withdraw from the school and hand over the leadership to other groups or individuals, in order to do a better job in institutions of higher education? I think that from the past facts, we can only draw the former conclusion, not the latter. In order to correct shortcomings, various methods can be adopted to expand democracy. But in any case, the core leadership role of the Party cannot be weakened. The current problem in institutions of higher education is not whether or not the Party should lead, or whether the Party can lead, but how the Party can lead better. The view that the Party cannot lead institutions of higher education well because some people deliberately underestimate the achievements of teaching reform is wrong.

　　II. How Does the Party Lead Institutions of Higher Education?

　　This is the question of the leadership system of the school. I have also had some personal experience with the "professors governing the university" proposed by many people. According to my memory, the slogan "professors governing the university" was put forward by Cai Yuanpei at Peking University after the May Fourth Movement. At that time, it had positive significance in resisting the interference of the warlord regime in the internal affairs of the school. However, the implementation time seems to be very short. Mr. Zhang Zigao told me that when Jiang Menglin succeeded him as president, he proposed the slogan "professors governing academics, the president governing the university." The "professors governing the university" at Tsinghua University began around 1930, when Luo Jialun was the president. However, the system of "professors governing the university" was not explicitly proposed. Only: 1. the professors' meeting; 2. professors' representatives participating in the school's evaluation committee and other organizations seem to be the manifestations of "professors governing the university" that everyone is referring to. It showed some old democratic forms within the school and played a role in resisting the interference of the old warlord regime in the internal affairs of the school. This is a good side. However, it also used "professors striking" to suppress the patriotic strikes of the students. Later, there were even phenomena of some factions manipulating and controlling it. During the Kunming period, there was even a case of the "young and strong faction" secretly organizing elections for representatives of the evaluation committee to exclude older professors. I think it is not appropriate or necessary to adopt it in today's institutions of higher education.

　　Why is it not appropriate to adopt it? Our new China is a country led by the Communist Party to build a socialist society. It has an essential difference from the situation in the old and new warlord periods in the past. To build a socialist society, everything is planned. The work of cultivating talents in institutions of higher education is part of the national plan, and its direction, policies, scale, and speed must all be in line with the national plan. Can it work without the leadership of the Party? At present, when we are building a socialist country, if we want to exclude the Communist Party, an organization that leads the work of the whole country and serves the people wholeheartedly, from the leading position of institutions of higher education, and instead adopt the old "professors governing the university" method of the old society, if small cliques occur, it will develop into manipulation and control; if no small cliques occur, there will be endless discussions and no consensus. This kind of leadership runs counter to the national policies and is fundamentally impossible to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all teachers. Therefore, I think it is not appropriate to adopt it.

　　Why is it not necessary to adopt it? Although the organization of the school affairs committees in various schools now includes representatives from all aspects, the general situation is that professors and associate professors account for the majority. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, there are 53 members of the school affairs committee, of which 38 are professors and associate professors, accounting for more than 71% of the total number of members. Moreover, since last year, whenever there are major topics, enlarged meetings of the school affairs committee have been held, inviting the directors and deputy directors of each teaching and research group to participate. This kind of democracy is far better than the previous "professors' meeting." Is there any need to organize a "professors' meeting" separately? Therefore, I think it is not necessary to adopt it.

　　However, in the past, the school's Party organization and individual Party members may have had some shortcomings and errors of subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, which caused resentment among the masses and damaged the work. This is precisely the purpose of this rectification.

　　III. Strengthening Ideological and Political Education for All Teachers, Students, and Staff

　　In addition to the guidelines and policies for teaching, scientific research, and administration, the Party's leadership in institutions of higher education also has a more important and inescapable aspect, which is the ideological and political education of all teachers, students, and staff. In the process of starting the rectification this time, calling on non-Party members to speak out freely and make suggestions to the Party and the leadership, it can be clearly seen that the thoughts of some people still have the remnants of bourgeois ideology, and a small number are even absurd to the point of being anti-socialist and anti-Communist. This kind of class struggle in thought deserves high vigilance.

　　I have mentioned in several symposiums in the past that we are now in a transitional period. The general task of the Party in the transitional period is: socialist industrialization; the socialist transformation of agriculture; and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts. After these socialist transformations are completed, the country will have reached a socialist society from a capitalist society. But I have thought deeply that in the transitional period, there is also a more important "socialist transformation of people" running through the whole process. That is to say, in the transitional period, if the thoughts of some people have not accepted socialist transformation, even if industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and commerce have basically achieved socialist characteristics in form, various contradictions will still occur in practical work. Because people are actually engaged in work, and people's thoughts guide their actions. Chairman Mao said: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." In fact, it is worse than having no soul. Because without good political thoughts, there must be bad political thoughts occupying his body, and sometimes it is even expressed in action.

　　It is undeniable that the vast majority of teachers, staff, and students in institutions of higher education today are from bourgeois or petty-bourgeois families. The older ones have come from a dark and complex society in the past. In the past seven or eight years, although the vast majority have made progress to varying degrees through the Party's continuous education and the inspiration of the rapid progress of the motherland's construction undertakings, once they encounter unhealthy trends, in addition to a part of people with truly firm positions, the general remnants of old thoughts will resurface; their positions will waver, and even fundamentally change their positions!

　　We colleagues who work together in institutions of higher education are responsible for educating people. And the students we train will be the leading cadres in various aspects of the country's socialist construction undertakings in the future. If we do not strengthen socialist transformation in thought, not only will the current work not be done well, but there will also be some problems at any time. In the future, graduates will be scattered in construction units across the country, and the bad influence will be even greater. Therefore, in the Party's leadership work in institutions of higher education, how to plan and implement the strengthening of ideological and political education for all teachers, students, and staff is a top priority and an inescapable issue.

　　IV. Specific Suggestions for Improving the Relationship Between School Leaders and the Masses

　　In addition to strengthening the administrative system, school leaders should also attach importance to directly contacting the masses and going deep into the grassroots. This is the only way to overcome the large number of shortcomings that have been revealed. The incomplete methods that I have thought of and have been tried in Tsinghua University in the past are as follows:

　　1. Establish a system for the president and vice presidents to regularly meet directly with the heads of departments, heads of teaching and research groups, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and main administrative cadres in rotation. In the past, we had tried to invite the heads of each department to report on their work in rotation, and at the same time ask them to raise the problems existing in the department and discuss them together. Later, due to the heavy burden of affairs inside and outside the school, it was not continued. At that time, I was almost trapped in meetings of all sizes every day. In the future, on the one hand, we should improve the working methods in the school and streamline the meetings; on the other hand, we also hope that the leadership will solve the problem of the excessive burden of extracurricular activities of the president and vice presidents. Last year, there was a period of more than half a year when all the five presidents, vice presidents, and deans of academic affairs of the school took turns to go out, and there was often only one person left at home to barely cope. As a result, colleagues shouted the slogan "the above is singing an empty city strategy, the below is doing automation"! How can bureaucracy not be produced in this way?

　　2. Establish a system for the president and vice presidents to inspect each department and each laboratory in phases. In the past, we had implemented it, watching three or two laboratories every week. Later, it was also suspended because we were busy.

　　3. Hold a congress of trade union representatives and a congress of student representatives once a year, and ask the representatives to put forward as many criticisms and suggestions on the work of the school as possible. The Party committee and the administration should seriously check and study, accept the correct opinions; and also explain clearly the opinions that are not comprehensive or not correct enough. In the past, Tsinghua University held two congresses of trade union representatives, and each time many opinions were raised, and disposal was carried out after the meeting. But it has not been institutionalized. In the future, it should be improved and institutionalized.

　　4. Seriously handle the regular opinions of the masses. In the past, each unit of Tsinghua University was equipped with a regular opinion book; and opinion boxes were set up in several key locations. Anyone can put forward opinions at any time. At the beginning, I personally read and approved the opinion book once a month. If the opinions were correct and important, I immediately contacted the relevant units by telephone, and improvements were made immediately if possible. If it was only related to the original unit, it was indicated. Later, because I was not healthy enough, it was changed to be managed and handled by the secretary, which may have been relaxed. I think that in the future, this work can be handled regularly by a vice president or assistant to the president designated by the president. It is very helpful to regularly discover and solve the contradictions between the masses and the leadership in the school.

　　5. Pay attention to mass letters and handle them in a unified manner with the above item.

　　Finally, I would like to say a few words about this rectification movement.

　　I think that the Party's proposal of a rectification movement for the whole Party this time fully demonstrates the Party's high sense of responsibility to the people, fully demonstrates the Party's selflessness to the people, and fully demonstrates the Party's lofty greatness. It asks the people of the whole country to work together with the Party to find out and overcome the various shortcomings of the Party in its work, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership and accelerate the progress of the country's socialist construction. Therefore, any opinion, as long as it is helpful to strengthening the Party's leadership and accelerating the country's socialist construction, even if only part of it is correct, the Party will humbly accept it, and the people will sincerely welcome it; on the contrary, if the opinions put forward lead to weakening the Party's leadership and hindering the country's socialist construction, the Party will never accept it, and the people will never agree. As for the very few people who attempt to use the Party's rectification to carry out a sharp class struggle, vainly trying to drag the country away from the socialist track, and even deliberately distort the facts and carry out slanders, the broad masses of the people cannot tolerate it and must rise up to give them severe criticism. Doing so is not hindering the rectification, but promoting the rectification and making the entire movement develop more healthily.

　　In general, in the rectification movement in the past month or so, although various different opinions have been put forward from all aspects, there must be a common standard when studying all problems, that is: Is the problem raised conducive to the country's socialist construction? Is it conducive to the unity of the people? Does it start from the collective interests of the people or simply revolve around his personal interests? And the core issue here is: Is it able to strengthen the Party's leadership. As for using various arguments and various proposals to attempt to replace or deviate from the Party's leadership or weaken the Party's leadership, in essence, they have resolutely stood on the bourgeois position, and on the surface, they still say that they support socialism and the Communist Party. That is just self-deception. All people with a firm socialist position will not believe it.

### 党在高等学校中的领导问题

　　党在高等学校中的领导问题
　　清华大学副校长　刘仙洲
    我在解放以后比较长的时间以内，是以党外知识分子的身份参加政府和学校工作的。在工作的实践和理论的学习当中，我进一步认识了党，同时也逐渐的改造了我自己的旧思想，一年多以前才加入了党。因为我在过去五年以来主要是参加清华大学的行政工作，所以我愿主要的谈一谈党在高等学校中的领导问题。
　　一、党能不能领导高等学校
    从过去教学改革成绩的估计来看，党是能领导高等学校的；而且高等学校必须由党领导。
    目前对于高等学校的工作还有争论的问题之一就是党能不能领导好高等学校。有少数人对于解放以来尤其是对于1952年教学改革以来的成绩故意予以过低的评价，其目的在于说明党领导不好高等学校，应该改用“教授治校”等制度，甚至有主张党应该退出学校的！判断这种说法是否正确的标准，应该从事实出发。就是说应该从教学改革以来高等学校工作的实际情况出发。关于教学改革成绩的估计问题，过去已经有过不少的讨论，我想只要客观地根据事实加以分析，就应该承认成绩还是主要的。教学改革的成绩，可由两方面加以检查，一是为国家培养人才的数量或速度方面：在建国七年多以来，全国高等学校，已为国家培养了三十多万毕业生。单就清华大学说，在解放后几年里边的工科毕业生，若连本年暑假毕业的也计算在内，已有两千八百多人，约相当过去几十年本校工科毕业生总数的三倍半。适应了祖国社会主义工业建设迅速发展的客观需要。又，在校学生人数增加到四倍；教师人数增加到三倍半以上；实验室数目增加到三倍以上；建筑面积增加到两倍以上。二是在质量上也有相当的提高。截到目前为止，除哈尔滨工业大学以外，虽说按五年制培养的学生今年暑假才有毕业生，质量怎样，还没有实例证明。但在过去几年，采用新教学制度和新教学方法以后的三年制、四年制、二年制专修科毕业生，甚至正在肄业的学生在生产实习时的表现，都已有不少的实例证明，是比从前有很大的进步。当然在工作中是有一些缺点的，如：院系调整时有一定程度的盲目性；学习苏联经验时消化得不够，反映在教学计划偏重与一些工作中的形式主义等方面；发展计划中也有一定的盲目性；和对学生某些方面的独立工作能力的培养还不够等。但是这些缺点丝毫也不能改变对成绩的基本估计。自然党在领导工作中也有不少的缺点，不过目前的问题在于：根据过去的事实，是需要党克服这些缺点而更加强领导，才能把高等学校的工作做得更好呢？还是要削弱党的领导，甚至要求党退出学校把领导权交给其他团体或个人，才能把高等学校的工作做得更好呢？我认为，从过去事实中只能得出前面的一个结论，而不是后面的一个结论。为了改正缺点，可采取各种方式扩大民主。但无论如何不能削弱党的核心领导作用。目前高等学校中的问题，不是要不要党的领导或党能不能领导的问题，而是党如何能领导得更好的问题。少数人故意低估教学改革的成绩，因而认为党领导不好高等学校的说法是错误的。
　　二、党怎样领导高等学校
    这就是学校领导的体制问题。我对于许多人提出的“教授治校”也曾经有过一些亲身的体验。根据我的记忆，“教授治校”的口号，是在五四运动以后，蔡元培在北京大学时提出来的。当时对于抵制军阀政权干预学校内部工作方面是有它积极的意义的。但是施行的时间似乎很短。张子高先生对我说，到蒋梦麟继任校长的时候，他就另提出“教授治学，校长治校”的口号。清华大学的“教授治校”是1930年左右，罗家伦当校长时开始搞的。但是并没有明确的提出“教授治校”的制度。只有：一、教授会；二、教授代表参加学校的评议会等组织，似乎就是大家所指的“教授治校”的表现。它对校内表现了一些旧民主形式，对校外起了一些抵制旧军阀政权干预学校内部工作的作用。这是好的一面。但是它也曾用“教授罢教”压迫过同学们的爱国罢课运动。后来更有些派系把持的现象。在昆明时期，更发生过“少壮派”暗中组织竞选评议会代表以排斥老年教授的事情。我认为在今天的高等学校里是不宜采用也不必采用的。
    为什么说不宜采用呢？我们新中国是由共产党领导建设社会主义社会的国家，它和过去新旧军阀时期的情况有着本质上的不同。建设社会主义社会，一切都是有计划的。高等学校培养人才的工作，是国家计划的一部分，它的方针、政策、规模、速度，在在都要和国家的计划相合。这样离开党的领导行么？在目前我们正在建设社会主义国家的时候，如果想把领导全国工作的，全心全意为人民服务的共产党这样一个组织，排在高等学校领导地位以外，反而采用旧社会的“教授治校”办法，有小宗派发生，则演成操纵把持；无小宗派发生，则议论纷纷，莫衷一是。这种领导与国家的方针政策是背道而驰的，根本不可能充分发挥全体教师的积极作用。所以我认为是不宜采用的。
    为什么说不必采用呢？现在各校校务委员会的组织，虽说是包括着各方面的代表，但是总的情况是教授和副教授占大多数。就清华大学说，校务委员会的成员共五十三人，其中教授和副教授即有三十八人，占全会人数71％以上。又自去年以来，凡有重大议题，多召开校务委员会扩大会议，请各教研组主任和副主任都参加。这样的民主远远胜过从前的“教授会”。还有什么另行组织“教授会”的必要呢？所以我认为是不必采用的。
    但是过去学校党组织和个别党员可能是有些主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义的缺点和错误，致群众起反感，使工作受损失。这正是这次整风的目的所在。
　　三、对全校师生员工加强思想政治教育问题
    党在高等学校的领导，除了对教学、科学研究和行政等方面的方针政策以外，还有更重要并且是责无旁贷的一方面，就是对于全校师生员工的思想政治教育。在这次开始整风，号召党外人士大放大鸣，向党和领导提意见的过程中，可以很清楚的看出，有一部分人的思想还存在着资产阶级思想的残余，一小部分甚至荒谬到反社会主义和反共产党的程度。这一种思想上的阶级斗争，是极值得提高警惕的。
    过去我在几次座谈会上曾提出过，我们现在正处在过渡时期。党提出过渡时期的总任务是：社会主义工业化；农业的社会主义改造；资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造。这几种社会主义改造完成以后，就是国家由资本主义社会到达了社会主义社会。但是我曾深入的想过，在过渡时期，还整个贯穿着一项更重要的“人的社会主义改造”。就是说，在过渡时期，如果有一部分人的思想没有接受社会主义改造，即使工业、农业、手工业和商业，在形式上都基本上达到了社会主义性质，在实际工作上仍是要发生种种矛盾的。因为人是实际从事工作的，而人的思想又是指导着他的行动的。毛主席说过：“没有正确的政治观点就等于没有灵魂”。实际上比着没有灵魂还坏。因为没有好的政治思想，就一定有坏的政治思想占据着他的躯壳，有时它更表现到行动上来。
    目前高等学校中的教师职工和同学，不必讳言，极大多数是资产阶级或小资产阶级的家庭出身的。年长一些的更是由过去黑暗复杂的社会过来的。在过去七、八年以来，经过党不断的教育和祖国各方面建设事业飞速进步的启发，虽说绝大多数都已有了不同程度的进步，但是一遇到歪风，除了一部分真正立场坚定的人以外，一般的旧思想残余就又要冒头；立场动摇，甚至根本上改变了立场！
    我们在高等学校共同工作的同人们是担负着教育人的责任的。而我们培养的同学们更是将来国家社会主义建设事业各方面的领导干部。我们若不在思想上加强进行社会主义改造，不但目前的工作做不好，且随时都有发生一些枝节的可能。将来毕业生散布在全国各建设单位，不好的影响就更大了。所以党在高等学校的领导工作里边，如何计划实施加强对全校师生员工的思想政治教育，是一项头等重要的问题，也是责无旁贷的问题。
　　四、改进学校领导与群众关系的具体意见
    除了加强行政这一系统以外，学校领导还应该重视直接联系群众深入基层的问题。这样才可以克服目前揭露出来的大量缺点。我所想到的和从前曾经在清华大学试行过的不完全的办法如下：
    一、建立校长、副校长定期与系主任、教研组主任、教授、讲师、助教及主要行政干部轮流直接晤谈的制度。在过去我们曾经试行过邀请各系主任轮流汇报工作，同时即请他们提出系里存在的问题，共同讨论。后来受到校内外事务繁重的影响，没有坚持继续下去。当时几乎每天陷于大小会议之中。今后应一面在校内改进工作方法，精简会议；另一方面还希望领导上解决校长副校长的校外活动负担过重问题。去年曾经有过半年多的时间，全校校长、副校长、教务长五个人轮流外出，经常只有一个人在家留守，勉强应付。以致同人们喊出“上面唱空城计，下面搞自动化”的口号！这样那能不产生官僚主义呢？
    二、建立校长、副校长分期视察各系及各实验室的制度。过去我们曾实行过，每星期看三几个实验室。后来也是因为忙停顿了。
    三、每年举行工会代表大会和学生代表大会各一次，请代表们尽量提出对学校工作的批评和建议，党委和行政要认真检查研究，接受正确的意见；不全面或不够正确的也要解释清楚。过去清华大学举行过两次工会代表大会，每次都提了不少意见，会后也曾进行过处理。但是没有把它制度化。今后应加以改进，并把它制度化。
    四、认真处理经常的群众意见。过去清华大学全校各单位都设置了经常的意见簿；在若干要冲地点更设置了意见箱。任何人都可以随时提意见。开始时，曾由我个人每月对意见簿批阅一次，意见正确重要的，马上用电话与有关单位联系，能改进的立即改进。只和原单位有关的，则加以批示。后来因为我身体不够健康，改由秘书经管处理，可能有些放松。我认为这一工作，今后可由校长指定副校长或校长助理一人经常负责处理。它是很有助于经常发现与解决校内群众与领导之间的矛盾的。
    五、重视群众来信，与上项统一处理。
    最后我想再对这次整风运动说几句话。
    我认为党这次提出全党的整风运动，充分表现出党对人民的高度负责精神，充分表现出党对人民的大公无私精神，充分表现出党的崇高伟大。要求全国人民和党一起找出并克服党在工作中的种种缺点，以便加强党的领导和加速祖国社会主义建设事业的进行。因此任何意见，只要对加强党的领导，对加速祖国社会主义建设有帮助，那怕只有部分是正确的，党都会虚心的加以接受，而人民也就会衷心的表示欢迎；相反的，所提意见如果导致削弱党的领导，阻碍祖国社会主义建设的，党就决不能加以接受，而人民也就决不会表示同意。至于极少数的人企图利用党的整风，进行尖锐的阶级斗争，妄想把国家拖离社会主义的轨道，甚至故意歪曲事实，进行诬蔑，那么广大人民是不能容忍的，必须起来予以严厉的批判。这样做并不是妨碍整风，而是推进整风，使整个运动更健康的向前发展。
    总的说来，在过去一个多月的整风运动中，各方面虽然提出了各种不同的意见，但研究一切问题时都必须有一个共同的标准，就是：所提问题是不是有利于祖国的社会主义建设？是不是有利于人民的团结？是不是由人民的集体的利益出发或单单是围绕着他个人的利益？而这里面的核心问题就是：是不是能加强党的领导。至于用种种说词，种种主张，企图代替或离开党的领导或削弱党的领导，骨子里早坚决的站在资产阶级立场，表面上还说是赞成社会主义，还说是拥护共产党，那只是自欺欺人之谈，所有社会主义立场坚定的人们是不会相信的。
