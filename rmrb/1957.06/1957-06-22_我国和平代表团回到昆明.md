　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st: The entire Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council meeting in Colombo, led by head of delegation Guo Moruo, returned to Kunming by plane this afternoon.
　　After disembarking, delegation secretary-general Liu Ningyi told reporters that the peace movement has been further expanded and deepened. He then said that as a result of the aggressive policies pursued by Britain, France, and the United States in the Asia-Africa region, more and more people in Asian and African countries are participating in the cause of opposing war and defending peace. At the meeting, representatives from Asia, Africa, and Latin America unanimously issued calls against colonialism. The demand for arms reduction and opposition to the use of nuclear weapons has become the common desire of all people.
　　On the evening of June 20, when the Chinese delegation passed through Yangon, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu held a banquet to entertain Guo Moruo and the delegation members. Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein invited the delegation members to breakfast on the morning of the 21st and saw them off at the airport.

　　我国和平代表团回到昆明
    据新华社昆明21日电　出席世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的中国代表团全体团员在团长郭沫若率领下，今天下午乘飞机回到昆明。
    代表团秘书长刘宁一在下飞机后对记者说，和平运动已经进一步扩大和深入了。他接着说，由于英法美在亚非地区实行侵略政策的结果，就使得更多的亚非国家人民参加到反对战争、保卫和平的事业中来。会上亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的代表们一致发出反殖民主义的呼声。要求缩减军备和反对使用核子武器成了所有人们的共同意愿。
    6月20日晚上，中国代表团途经仰光的时候，缅甸总理吴努曾举行宴会招待郭沫若和代表团人员。缅甸副总理吴觉迎21日早晨请代表团人员进早餐，并到机场送行。
