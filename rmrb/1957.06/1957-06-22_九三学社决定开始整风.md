　　Jiusan Society Decides to Start Rectification Campaign

    (Our Newspaper) The Jiusan Society held its 16th Enlarged Meeting of the Central Standing Committee last night. After discussion, the entire body approved the decision to launch a struggle against the rightists and carry out a rectification campaign within the society, as well as a statement rescinding Chu Anping's position as a member of the Guangming Daily's Administrative Committee, representing the Jiusan Society.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Xu Deheng, based on the situation since the start of the rectification movement, suggested launching a rectification movement throughout the society to expose and criticize actions and thoughts that oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Party, and oppose the people's democratic dictatorship. He also suggested removing Chu Anping from his position as a member of the Guangming Daily's Administrative Committee, representing the Jiusan Society, and demanded that all democratic parties jointly investigate the responsibility of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping for unilaterally altering the political direction of the Guangming Daily.

    The meeting, after hearing a report by Deputy Secretary-General Li Yi on the recent meeting of the Guangming Daily's Administrative Committee discussing the issue of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping unilaterally altering the political direction of the Guangming Daily, and a report by Deputy Secretary-General Wang Zhixiang on recent telegrams and letters from many local organizations and members of the Jiusan Society demanding a resolute struggle against the rightists, held discussions and then unanimously passed a resolution calling on the entire society to launch a struggle against the rightists and carry out a rectification campaign within the society. The decision pointed out that the struggle of the people of the whole country against the rightists is essentially a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. All members of the Jiusan Society should actively participate in this serious struggle and wage unremitting struggle against the rightists and for upholding the socialist road. In order to better carry out the struggle against the rightists, the Central Standing Committee has decided to conduct a rectification campaign within the society. The task of the rectification is to thoroughly expose and criticize reactionary thoughts, words, and deeds that oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, to draw a clear line between ourselves and the rightists, to distinguish right from wrong, to firm our position, and to resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party and build socialism. The decision requires all levels of Jiusan Society organizations to immediately lead members in studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," especially the six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds. The decision also pointed out that during the period of rectification within the society, organizations at all levels should temporarily suspend the recruitment of new members. During the rectification period, Jiusan Society members should, on the one hand, continue to offer opinions to the Party to help the Party in its rectification; on the other hand, organizations at all levels should also strive for Party organizations and Party members to offer opinions to the society and its members to help the rectification within the society. The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution on the issue of pursuing responsibility for Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping unilaterally altering the political direction of the Guangming Daily, and rescinded the statement that Chu Anping represented the Jiusan Society as a member of the Guangming Daily's Administrative Committee.

    A total of nineteen people spoke at the meeting. Vice-Chairman Liang Xi made a written statement at the meeting. Those who spoke all continued to seriously expose and criticize Chu Anping's erroneous words and deeds in the spirit of curing the sickness to save the patient, starting from the desire for unity. Chu Anping also made a brief speech at the meeting, saying that he admitted his mistakes, especially when he saw reactionary newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong cheering for his speech, he felt very heavy. He said that he would earnestly dig into the roots of his thinking and confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.
