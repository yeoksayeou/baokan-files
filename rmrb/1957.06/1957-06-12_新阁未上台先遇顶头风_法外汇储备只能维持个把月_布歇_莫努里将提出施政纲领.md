Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Paris: A French Bank official said that France's entire foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted by mid-July unless strong measures are taken to adjust the serious import surplus.

This shocking state of French finances is causing Bourgès-Maunoury, who has been tasked with forming a new cabinet, a great deal of trouble. On the 8th, he held a series of meetings with French Bank officials and senior officials from the Ministry of Finance until late at night. He also spent most of the Whit Monday holiday consulting with members of his own Radical Socialist Party in order to find someone willing to take on the post of Minister of Finance.

It is reported that French financial officials and economic experts have suggested that Bourgès-Maunoury try to reduce imports, expand exports, and adopt a series of measures such as cutting budgets, levying new taxes, freezing wages, and tightening loans to "shrink" the excessively inflated currency. In addition, they also suggested taking a temporary "emergency measure," which is to ask the French Bank to advance a huge sum of 100 billion francs to "stabilize" France's foreign trade in order to survive until September.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: After the French government crisis lasted for nearly three weeks, President Coty officially nominated Radical Socialist Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury as a candidate for Prime Minister on the 10th, and announced that he would formally accept the resignation of former Prime Minister Mollet on the 11th. Bourgès-Maunoury intends to submit his policy program to the National Assembly on the 12th, asking the assembly to vote on the fate of his new cabinet. In the list of ministers of the new cabinet drafted by Bourgès-Maunoury, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is Pineau.

Bourgès-Maunoury said that the new cabinet's policies will include: promulgating plans to strengthen the economy and stabilize finances; strengthening military operations in Algeria; and requesting the parliament to approve the "Common Market" and "Euratom" treaties of the six Western European countries before the summer recess.

Because the Catholic "Popular Republican Movement", De Gaulle's "Social Republican Party", and Pleven and Mitterrand's "Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance" have refused to participate in the new cabinet, Bourgès-Maunoury's government will be a "minority government" composed mainly of Radical and Socialist parties with an extremely narrow parliamentary base.

　　新阁未上台先遇顶头风
　　法外汇储备只能维持个把月
　　布歇—莫努里将提出施政纲领
    新华社11日讯  巴黎消息：法兰西银行负责人说，法国全部外汇储备将在今年7月中旬以前用尽，除非采取有力的措施来调整严重的入超情况。
    法国财政这种令人吃惊的情况使得奉命组织新阁的布歇—莫努里大伤脑筋。他在8日同法兰西银行负责人和财政部常任官员们举行了一系列会谈，直到深夜。他还把圣灵降临节假日的大部分时间用来同他自己的激进社会党党员们进行磋商，以便找到愿意担任财政部长职务的人。
    据报道，法国的财政官员和经济专家们建议布歇—莫努里设法减少进口，扩大出口，并且采取削减预算、征收新税、冻结工资和紧缩贷款等一系列措施来“收缩”过度膨胀的通货。此外，他们还建议采取一个暂时的“救急办法”，就是要求法兰西银行垫出一千亿法郎的巨款来“稳定”法国的对外贸易，以便能够苟延到9月。
    据新华社11日讯  在法国政府危机持续了近三个星期之后，总统戈蒂10日正式提名激进社会党人布歇—莫努里为总理候选人，并且宣布在11日正式接受前总理摩勒的辞呈。布歇—莫努里打算在12日向国民议会提出他的施政纲领，要求议会就他的新内阁的命运进行表决。在布歇—莫努里拟就的新阁部长名单中，外交部长是比诺。
    布歇—莫努里说，新内阁的施政方针将包括：颁布有关加强经济和稳定财政的计划；加强在阿尔及利亚的军事行动；要求议会在暑假休会之前批准西欧六国“共同市场”和“原子联营组织”条约。
    由于天主教的“人民共和党”、戴高乐派的“社会共和党”和普利文及密持朗等人的“民主社会抵抗联盟”拒绝参加新阁，布歇—莫努里的政府将是一个议会基础极其狭窄的主要由激进党人和社会党人组成的“少数派政府”。
