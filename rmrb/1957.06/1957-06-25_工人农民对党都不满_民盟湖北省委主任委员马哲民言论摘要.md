What They're Saying

    "Workers and Peasants are Dissatisfied with the Party"
    Excerpts from Remarks by Ma Zhemian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League
    It is very difficult for veteran party members to grow accustomed to loving the broad masses of the people. Of course, they united with the people in the past. Uniting with and loving the people was originally the purpose of the Party, but at that time, it was mainly about attacking and eliminating the enemy. Therefore, uniting the people and mobilizing the masses was only to attack the enemy. The purpose became the means, putting the cart before the horse. Now, asking them to love the people is something they are not used to.
    There are two types of ideology within the Party. Older comrades are mostly empiricist, unable to rise to the level of theory, while new party members are dogmatic, with no real understanding of Marxism-Leninism. The combination of the two is subjectivism. In personnel arrangements, the Party emphasizes virtue, and regards those outside the Party as lacking virtue. Now, in universities, the contradiction between young students, workers, and the Party has surpassed the contradiction between senior intellectuals and the Party, becoming the most important and acute contradiction in party-masses relations in schools. This contradiction is difficult to resolve.
    "Many leading comrades of the CCP... believe that they are the embodiment of truth... They are like 'natural-born saints.' This is equivalent to Christians saying, 'I represent God.'"
    Being a party member is politics, being a party member is virtue, like the old saying, the virtue of a party member is like the feudal saying that "lack of talent is a virtue."
    Communist Party members are wooden puppets without brains. Even workers and peasants are dissatisfied with the Party. The position of the Communist Party is very dangerous. Today's Communist Party members are very arrogant. Even if I were asked to join the Party, I would have to consider it. In the past, some Communist Party members resigned from the Party, and the responsibility does not lie with the party members, nor is it accidental, but is related to the mess within the Party.
    Many problems have arisen in institutions of higher learning because of the Party committee system. The Party committee system should be abolished in schools and factories, and veteran cadres should withdraw from schools.

### “工人农民对党都不满”  民盟湖北省委主任委员马哲民言论摘要

    “工人农民对党都不满”
    民盟湖北省委主任委员马哲民言论摘要
    要老党员对广大人民热爱，这对他们很不习惯。当然，过去他们也是团结人民的，团结、热爱人民本来是党的目的，但是那时候主要是打击、消灭敌人，因此团结人民发动群众只是为了打击敌人，目的变成了手段，本末倒置了，现在要他热爱人民反而不习惯了。
    党内思想有二种情况，老同志多是经验主义，不能提高到理论上来，新党员则是教条主义，根本不懂马列主义，两者结合起来就是主观主义。在人事安排上，党偏重德，而且把党外的都看成无德，现在在大专学校中，青年学生、工友和党的矛盾现在已经超过了高级知识分子和党的矛盾，成了学校里党群关系最主要的最尖锐的矛盾。这个矛盾很难解决。
    “中共不少领导同志……认为自己就是真理的化身……他们俨然是‘天生的圣人’。这就等于基督教徒说：‘我代表上帝’了。
    党员就是政治，党员就是德，好像老话说的，党员之德是封建社会的无才便是德。
    共产党员是木头人，没有脑筋。连工人、农民对党都不满，共产党的地位很危险。今天共产党员很骄傲，要我入党，我也得考虑。过去有的共产党员退党，责任不在党员，同时也不是偶然的，与党内一团糟有关。
    高等学校因为有了党委制，才产生了许多问题。在学校、工厂要取消党委制，老干部要退出学校。
