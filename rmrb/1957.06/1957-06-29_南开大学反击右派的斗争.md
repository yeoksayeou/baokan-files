　　Nankai University's Struggle to Counterattack the Rightists
　　By our reporter Zhong Lin

    The teachers and students of Nankai University in Tianjin are drawing weapons from studying Chairman Mao's reports to deepen the struggle against the Rightists. What is introduced here are only two fragments of the history department of this university during the high tide of counterattacking the Rightists.

    After the Party organization of Nankai University began the rectification campaign, Tan Tianrong, the leader of the "Hundred Flowers Society," a reactionary clique at Peking University, visited Nankai University three times in early June. Although he was spurned by the majority of students, there were also a few Rightists who supported him, saying that Tan Tianrong was a "genius student" with "the spirit of the times." Some people who did not recognize Tan Tianrong's reactionary face, although they disagreed with his ideas, thought that since he studied physics and also researched philosophy, he could be considered erudite, and perhaps a master in his own right. Ge Peiqi's and Chu Anping's reactionary remarks also had echoers in the history department of Nankai University. The Rightists' fallacies were refuted in big-character posters, group meetings, and class meetings. The exposure and condemnation of the Rightists' conspiracies published in the newspapers made more and more people realize that there were indeed serious class struggles on the ideological and political fronts. And the arrogance of the Rightists was still rampant.

    On June 15, the student union of the history department held a conference to discuss the Tan Tianrong issue. After two other professors spoke, Professor Lei Haizong spoke. Mr. Lei said that he had been troubled by the fallacies published in the newspapers and on the big-character posters in the previous period. After seeing the rebuttals of these fallacies in the newspapers in the past few days, his doubts were dispelled. He said: "Some people are deliberately trying to deviate from the socialist line and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, which means they want to take the capitalist road, because there is no third road, it is false. However, history proves that the capitalist road is impassable, because the imperialists will not allow us to do so; they only want us to be semi-colonies."

    Speaking of his attitude toward the rectification campaign, he said: "The basic situation in China is that it is too poor and its economy and culture are backward, which is formed by historical conditions. To build socialism in a planned way in this large country with 600 million people, which is poor and backward, there will inevitably be many difficulties, and there will inevitably be major and minor mistakes and shortcomings in the work. But we cannot abandon history and attribute these difficulties, errors, and shortcomings to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Of course, in the rectification campaign, it is right to point out difficulties and shortcomings and errors separately, but the purpose is to overcome difficulties and shortcomings and errors and solve problems, not to oppose the Party and the government. If we act according to the opinions of those who want to deviate from the socialist line, who want to abolish the leadership of the Party, and who want to abolish the People's Government, China will inevitably return to the situation of a semi-colony like a subjugated slave, which is not rectification but asking us to drive backwards."

    Regarding Tan Tianrong's visit to him, he said: "Of course, I have to receive young people who come to me. When talking about Hegel's philosophy, I asked Tan Tianrong: Which books of Hegel have you read? He said that he had only read part of the few books translated into Chinese. I asked him if he could read foreign language books. He said no. I asked him if he had consulted Mr. He Lin, who is very knowledgeable in Hegel's philosophy at Peking University. He said no. I advised him: If you want to study philosophy, to study Hegel, you must at least learn a foreign language, read all of Hegel's works thoroughly, and you can also talk to Mr. He Lin. Philosophy is a systematic and comprehensive profound science that explains the world and social history, don't take it so simply."

    Mr. Lei told everyone that he studied history, but he also read some of the most idealistic and profound philosophies. He felt that these philosophies were all class-based and were all trying to explain the world, but he did not feel this way about Tan Tianrong's great work, but only felt embarrassed, because it was only an accumulation of nouns and concepts and did not say anything.

    Many students, after listening to Mr. Lei Haizong's speech, felt that Tan Tianrong, who was praised by the Rightists in the school as having "the spirit of the times" and being a "genius student," was originally only so-so academically. They felt that Tan Tianrong's and those anti-socialist people's words and deeds were very dangerous, and they must be highly vigilant and fight against them. Individual Rightists who had supported Tan Tianrong still stood up to defend him and praised Tan Tianrong for having the spirit of "independent thinking" and "boldness," but were defeated by the audience's anger and the refutations of other students who spoke.

    In group and class meetings, Yao Anquan, a student in the first class of the history department, repeatedly said that Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping were telling "facts," that the unified purchase and sales system had messed things up, and that the people's living standards had declined. He believed that the "three evils" were the main enemies, and the root of the "three evils" was "the Party's world," and that opposing the "three evils" without shaking the Party's leadership was impossible. He also openly stated that he was not holding the banner of helping the Party's rectification campaign, nor was he helping the Party's rectification campaign. He was disgusted with and dissatisfied with the Communist Party. If a counter-revolutionary organization invited him to join, he would consider it. Everyone demanded to argue with him and to clarify their positions in the debate.

    On the 16th, the history department held another discussion meeting. Yao Anquan first spoke and made some explanations, but his views and positions did not change at all.

    Among those who spoke was Lu Yanding, a student of worker origin. He said that Yao Anquan could consider the matter of joining a counter-revolutionary organization; as a member of the Chinese people, anyone should demand that counter-revolutionary elements be arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau, not consider joining their organization. He said that he had worked as a fireman in the Jinan Railway Administration system for five years and was familiar with the lives of the old workers: During the Japanese occupation, the workers ate bean cakes and smelly corn flour; during the Kuomintang rule, prices soared, and the workers' lives were threatened every day; the Japanese and the Kuomintang both sent foremen and supervisors holding iron bars, who hit the workers at any time; in the past, there was no labor protection equipment, and accidents of machines rolling up clothes and crushing workers to death and injury were also common. But now, in the seven or eight years since liberation, with the development of production, not to mention no worries about food and clothing, many workers have also opened accounts in banks; many workers also have radios at home; factories not only have labor protection equipment, but also often inspect it; some workers still have difficulties, but they can get relief or subsidies from the state and trade unions. Has this ever happened in any dynasty in Chinese history? Why is this still a decline in living standards? Could it be that these workers do not want the leadership of the Communist Party? No. His speech won prolonged thunderous applause.

    Zhang Jinguang, a student of peasant origin, stepped onto the stage and spoke about the suffering of peasant families in their village before the land reform; about how he reached out to his mother for food when he was hungry when he was a child, but there was no food at home, and his mother told him to "go out and play"; about how his family let him go to elementary school. He said: "I never dreamed that I could go to college, but now, I not only went to middle school, but also went to college. Could this be possible without the leadership of the Communist Party?" He said that he shared the same fate as the Communist Party.

    Chen Boquan, a student who had worked in the county people's government, used his own personal experience to talk about the benefits of the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain in stabilizing grain prices and ensuring the grain supply in urban industrial and mining areas and disaster areas. He also pointed out that what was purchased in a unified way was part of the surplus grain of farmers other than rations, and that wealthy peasants and well-to-do middle peasants with more surplus grain were dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sales system, and they always said that the unified purchase and sales system had messed things up. He said that some rural work comrades sometimes had shortcomings in estimating grain yields too high or too low, but the higher authorities had always paid attention to correcting them. But this cannot deny the achievements of the unified purchase and sales system.

    Chen Ruiliang spoke as an overseas Chinese and a member of the China Democratic League. He said that he had lived in a colony. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, overseas Chinese were never treated as human beings. Overseas Chinese could not even hold their heads up. Now it is different. Overseas Chinese can hold their heads up abroad, because our country has the leadership of the Communist Party. I am a member of the China Democratic League. I think that those people in the central committee of the China Democratic League who are attacking the Communist Party cannot represent the China Democratic League. I want to follow the Communist Party.

    Zhang Bangxun reminded everyone that the same facts about the unified purchase and sales system and the people's lives, why do some people say it has messed things up, and some people say it is doing well? Isn't this a matter of position? His speech aroused everyone's feelings and also aroused everyone's deep thoughts.

    After the end of this conference, in the students' conversations and in the group discussions, many people examined their views and positions on many remarks, and some people with right-leaning sentiments also reviewed and criticized their confused thoughts. Many people said that they wanted to argue, to uphold the correct position in the debate, and continue to smash the attacks of the Rightists.

　　南开大学反击右派的斗争
　　本报记者　锺林
    天津南开大学的师生们，正在从学习毛主席的报告里取得武器，来深入开展反击右派的斗争。这里介绍的只是这个大学的历史系在反击右派的高潮当中的两个片断。
    南开大学的党组织开始整风以后，6月上旬，北京大学反动小集团“百花学社”的首领谭天荣，曾先后三次到南开大学活动。他虽然遭到广大同学的唾弃，但是，也有几个右派分子为他捧场，说谭天荣是“天才学生”，具有“时代精神”。一些不认识谭天荣的反动面貌的人，虽然不同意他那一套，但以为他既学物理学，又研究哲学，也可称渊博，总可以算一家吧。葛佩琦和储安平的反动言论，在南大历史系里也有应声虫。右派分子的谬论，曾在大字报、小组会、班会上遭到驳斥。报纸上发表的对右派阴谋的揭露和斥责，使愈来愈多的人认识到：在思想战线上和政治战线上，的确还有严重的阶级斗争。而右派分子的气焰也还在嚣张。
    6月15日，历史系学生会开大会讨论谭天荣的问题，在其他两位教授发言以后，由雷海宗教授发言。雷先生说，他对前一时期报纸上和大字报上发表的一些人的谬论感到疑虑。这几天看到报纸上对这些谬论的驳斥，他的疑虑才消除了。他说：“有些人蓄意要脱离社会主义路线和马列主义的指导，那就是要走资本主义路线，因为第三条路线是没有的，是虚假的。但是，历史证明，资本主义路线走不通，因为帝国主义不让我们如此，他们只愿意让我们作半殖民地。”
    谈到对整风的态度时，他说：“中国的基本情况一是太穷，一是经济文化落后，这是历史条件所形成的。要在这个六亿人口的、又穷又落后的大国，来有计划地建设社会主义，必然有很多困难，工作中也必然会发生大大小小的错误和缺点。但不能抛开厂史，把这些困难、错误和缺点都算在共产党和人民政府的账上。当然，在整风当中，分别指出困难和缺点错误是应该的，但目的都是为了克服困难和缺点错误，解决问题，不是为了反对党和政府。如果按照那些要脱离社会主义路线，要取消党的领导，要取消人民政府的人的意见去作，中国就必然回到亡国奴式的半殖民地的局面去，这就不是整风而是要我们开倒车”。
    关于谭天荣访问他的事，他说：“青年们来找我，我当然是要接待的。谈到黑格尔的哲学，我问谭天荣：你读过黑格尔的哪些书？他说只读过中国翻译过来的几本书中的一部分。我问他你能读外文书吗？他说不能。我问他向北大对黑格尔哲学很有研究的贺麟先生请教过吗？他说没有。我劝他：你要想学哲学，要研究黑格尔，你至少得学会外文，熟读黑格尔的所有著作，也可以找贺麟先生谈谈。哲学是一门有系统的全面的对世界对社会历史的解释的高深学问，不要把它看得那么简单”。
    雷先生对大家说，我是学历史学的，但对于最唯心的深奥的哲学也读过一些，我感到这些哲学都有阶级性，都在企图说明世界，但对谭天荣的大作则没有这种感觉，而只感到为难，因为它只是名词概念的堆积，没有说出任何问题。
    许多同学听了雷海宗先生的讲话，感到被学校中的右派分子捧为“时代精神”和“天才学生”的谭天荣，在学术上原来不过如此而已。对谭天荣和那些反社会主义的人们的言行则感到十分危险，必须提高警惕，并且要与之进行斗争。个别曾为谭天荣捧场的右派分子，虽然还起来辩护，还赞扬谭天荣有“独立思考”和“大胆”的精神，但被听众的愤怒和其他发表意见的同学的驳斥击溃了。
    在小组和班的会上，历史系一年级一班的学生姚安全，口口声声说葛佩琦、储安平说的是“事实”，统购统销就是搞糟了，人民生活水平就是下降了。他认为“三害”是主要的敌人，而“三害”的根子则是“党天下”，要反对“三害”，要想不动摇党的领导是不行的。他还公然表示，他并不打着帮助党整风的旗帜，他也不是帮助党整风，他对共产党就是有反感，就是不满意。如果有反革命组织请他参加，他就要考虑。大家纷纷要求要跟他争论，要在争论中辨明立场。
    16日，历史系又举行了一次讨论会。姚安全首先发言作了些解释，但他的观点和立场并没有丝毫改变。
    发言的人当中，有一个是工人出身的吕延鼎同学。他说，对于参加反革命的组织这件事，姚安全可以考虑；作为中国人民中的一员，任何人对于反革命分子是要求把他抓送公安局的问题，而不是考虑去加入他的组织的问题。他说，他在济南铁路管理局系统当过五年司炉工人，对老工人们的生活比较熟悉：日本占领时期，工人们吃的是豆饼和发臭的苞米面；国民党统治时期，物价飞涨，工人们的生活天天受威胁；日本人和国民党都派得有工头和监工员拿着铁棍，随时打在工人身上；从前哪有什么劳动保护设备，机器卷着衣服把工人轧死轧伤的事情也常见。而现在，解放七、八年来，随着生产的发展，别说吃穿不愁了，许多工人还在银行里开了户头；家里有收音机的工人也不少；工厂里不仅有劳动保护设备，而且还常常检查；有的工人虽然也还有困难，但可以得到国家和工会的救济或补助。这些，在中国历史上是哪朝哪代有过的事？这为什么还是生活水平下降呢？难道这些工人会不要共产党领导吗？不会的。他的发言博得了长久的雷一般的掌声。
    农民出身的张金光同学，走上讲台，讲了他们村里土地改革前农民家庭受苦受难的情形；讲了他小时候肚子饿了伸手给母亲要干粮吃，家里没有了干粮，母亲叫他“你到外边玩玩去吧”的情形；讲了他一家如何让他上小学的情形。他说：“我从前做梦也没有想到过我能上大学，可是，现在，我不仅上了中学，还上了大学，这没有共产党领导能行吗？”他说他跟共产党是同命运的。
    曾在县人民政府工作过的陈伯泉同学用自己的亲身经历，讲了粮食统购统销政策对稳定粮价、对保证城市工矿区和灾区的粮食供应的好处，他并且指出，统购的是农民除口粮外的余粮的一部分，余粮较多的富农、富裕中农对统购统销是不满意的，他们就老说统购统销搞糟了。他说，有的农村工作同志有时对粮食的产量，核定得有偏高偏低的缺点，但上级是一直注意加以纠正的。但这不能因此否定统购统销的成绩。
    陈瑞良同学以华侨、民盟盟员的身份发言。他说，他在殖民地生活过，中华人民共和国成立以前，人家向来是不把华侨当人看待的，华侨连头也抬不起来。现在不同了，华侨在国外抬得起头来了，这是因为我们的国家有了共产党的领导才能如此。我是一个民盟盟员，我认为民盟中央那些向共产党进攻的人不能代表民盟，我要跟共产党走。
    张邦勋同学提醒大家，同是统购统销和人民生活中的这些事实，为什么有的人就说搞糟了，有的人就说搞好了呢？这不是立场问题是什么问题呢？他的发言引起大家的同感，也引起了大家的深思。
    这次大会结束以后，在同学们的交谈当中，在小组讨论当中，许多人都检查了自己对许多言论的看法和立场，一部分有右倾情绪的人，也纷纷检讨和批判自己的糊涂思想。许多人都表示，要争论，要在争论当中坚持正确的立场，继续粉碎右派分子的进攻。
