Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, to commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the declaration between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in Belgrade, the Yugoslav newspapers "Borba" and "Politika" both published lengthy articles on the 2nd. In their commentaries, they once again welcomed the improvement of relations between the two countries.

    "Borba" pointed out in its commentary that the people of all nationalities of Yugoslavia, their government, and the Party are prepared to make the greatest efforts to further improve relations with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries based on the Belgrade Declaration. It went on to say: Yugoslavia pursues a foreign policy based on socialist principles, and it hopes to maintain good and peaceful relations with all countries, especially with those countries that are linked by common socialist ideas, and to achieve fruitful cooperation.

    After presenting the basic principles of the Belgrade Declaration, "Borba" emphasized that on these principles, cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union has been increasing in all aspects in the past period. At the same time, Yugoslavia has also developed successful cooperation with other Eastern countries.

    "Borba" also stated that in the past two years, a series of issues arising from the relationship between each other must be resolved; it is not surprising that some differences of opinion have occurred. But it must be emphasized that difficulties have been gradually overcome. Both countries believe that ideological differences should not be allowed to cause the destruction and deterioration of fruitful cooperation. Matters of principle can be discussed without harming friendly relations between each other, and time and practice will best and most effectively prove which opinions are correct.

    "Politika" emphasized in its commentary that the Belgrade Declaration pointed out the main principles that should be based on relations between countries, especially between socialist countries. Everything that has happened in the international arena and in Sino-Yugoslav relations fully confirms the correctness and great significance of the Belgrade Declaration. The commentary said that, of course, there are still differences of opinion on many political issues, but the declaration recognized the existence of such differences when defining the basis of cooperation.

    "Politika" further emphasized that the recent period shows that further developing Sino-Yugoslav relations in accordance with the Belgrade Declaration is the only natural and historically inevitable path. Unswervingly implementing the principles of this declaration is not only in the interests of the people of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of all socialist countries, the international workers' movement, and world peace.

    苏南友好符合世界和平利益
    南斯拉夫报纸纪念苏南宣言两周年
    据新华社3日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：为了纪念南斯拉夫和苏联在贝尔格莱德签署宣言两周年，南斯拉夫的“战斗报”和“政治报”都在2日发表了长篇文章。它们在评论中再度欢迎两国关系的改善。
    “战斗报”在评论中指出，南斯拉夫各族人民、他们的政府和党准备尽最大努力根据贝尔格莱德宣言来进一步改善同苏联和一切社会主义国家的关系。它接着说：南斯拉夫奉行的是以社会主义原则为基础的对外政策，它希望同一切国家、特别是同那些以共同的社会主义思想联系在一起的国家保持良好与和平的关系，并取得有成果的合作。
    “战斗报”在提出贝尔格莱德宣言的基本原则后强调说：在这些原则上，南斯拉夫和苏联之间的合作在过去时期在一切方面都在日益增加。同时，南斯拉夫和其他东方国家也发展了成功的合作。
    “战斗报”还说，在过去两年中，从彼此关系中产生的一系列问题必须得到解决；发生一些意见分歧也是不足为奇的。但是必须强调，困难已经在逐渐克服。两国都认为，不应当让意识形态方面的分歧造成有成果的合作的破坏和恶化。原则问题可以进行讨论而不损害彼此间的友好关系，而时间和实践将最好和有效地证明那些意见是正确的。
    “政治报”在评论中强调指出，贝尔格莱德宣言指出了各国之间的关系、特别是社会主义国家之间的关系应该依据的主要原则。在国际方面和苏南关系中所发生的一切事情完全证实了贝尔格莱德宣言的正确性和重大意义。评论说，当然，在许多政治问题上还存在着意见分歧，但是宣言在确定合作的基础时认识到这种分歧的存在。
    “政治报”进一步强调，最近这一时期表明，根据贝尔格莱德宣言进一步发展苏南关系是唯一自然的和从历史观点来说是不可避免的道路。始终不懈地实行这个宣言的原则既符合南苏两国人民的利益，也符合所有社会主义国家、国际工人运动和世界和平的利益。
