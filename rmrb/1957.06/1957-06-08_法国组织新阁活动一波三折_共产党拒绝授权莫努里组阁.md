Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The formation of a new cabinet in France has encountered fresh setbacks.

After six days of activity, the chairman of the Popular Republican Movement, Pflimlin, who was attempting to form the 23rd post-war French government as soon as possible, formally announced the failure of his cabinet formation on June 5th due to the refusal of the Socialist Party to join the government. Following tense consultations, President Coty appointed Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, the Minister of Defense in the Mollet government and a member of the Radical Socialist Party, to form a new government that same evening.

Before Bourgès-Maunoury accepted the invitation to form a cabinet, Coty had invited Mollet and René Billères, the Minister of Education in the Mollet government, to form a new government, but they both refused.

Bourgès-Maunoury began his efforts to tentatively form a new cabinet on June 6th.

The Central Committee of the French Communist Party, its parliamentary groups in both houses, and its group in the French Community Assembly issued a communiqué stating that the French Communist Party refused to authorize Minister Bourgès-Maunoury, who advocates for war in Algeria, to form a cabinet. The Communist Party can only support a premier who immediately seeks peace in Algeria and promotes the passage of financial measures that make wealthy people pay. The communiqué called on French Communists to strive to form a united front with socialist workers.

According to "L'Humanité," all strata of the French people are demanding the establishment of a left-wing government capable of realizing the program endorsed by the majority of voters in the January 1956 parliamentary elections, in order to meet the common demands for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, improvement of the material conditions of working people, easing of international tensions, and disarmament.

    法国组织新阁活动一波三折
    共产党拒绝授权莫努里组阁
    据新华社讯　法国组织新内阁的活动又遭到了新的波折。
    力图及早组成战后法国第二十三届政府的人民共和党主席弗林姆兰在奔忙了六天之后，由于社会党拒绝政府，不得不在6月5日正式宣布组阁失败。经过紧张的商谈后，戈蒂总统已经在当天晚上委任摩勒政府的国防部长、激进社会党人布歇—莫努里筹组新政府。
    在布歇—莫努里接受组阁邀请之前，戈蒂曾经先后邀请摩勒和摩勒政府的教育部长、雷纳·毕埃尔组织新政府，但是他们都拒绝了。
    布歇—莫努里在6月6日开始进行试组新阁的活动。
    法国共产党中央委员会、党在两院的议会党团和在法兰西联邦议会的党团为此发表公报说，法国共产党拒绝授权主张在阿尔及利亚进行战争的部长布歇—莫努里组阁。共产党只能支持立即谋求在阿尔及利亚实现和平、促使通过使有钱人出钱的财政措施的总理。公报号召法国共产党人努力争取同社会党劳动者组成统一阵线。
    据“人道报”报道，法国各阶层人民都要求成立一个能实现1956年1月议会选举时大多数选民所赞同的纲领的左翼政府，以满足和平解决阿尔及利亚问题、改善劳动人民的物质状况、缓和国际紧张局势和裁军的共同要求。
