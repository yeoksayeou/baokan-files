Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 5th: The Japanese Diet members' league for promoting Japan-China trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japan China Import and Export Association held a joint meeting today and decided to request the Japanese government to adopt measures to abolish the embargo against China and promote Japan-China trade. These three groups related to Japan-China trade believe that the United Kingdom's independent relaxation of the embargo against China will inevitably seriously affect Japan's trade with China. The three groups will send representatives to meet with Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to urge him to decide on the fourth Japan-China trade agreement as soon as possible and request his assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 5th: The Ministry of International Trade and Industry stated in its 1956 trade situation white paper released yesterday that Japan's import and export trade both reached their highest post-war peaks last year: exports increased by 24% compared to the previous year, totaling 2.5 billion US dollars; imports increased by 31% compared to the previous year, an increase of 760 million US dollars, totaling 3.2 billion US dollars. The significant increase in export trade in the past three years has made industry and commerce "unprecedentedly active."

However, the white paper pointed out that despite this, Japan's exports last year only reached 86% of the pre-war level, while imports increased by 14% compared to pre-war levels. Due to the large increase in imports, Japan's international balance of payments experienced an imbalance last year.

In this white paper, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry admitted that Japan's current foreign trade is unstable. It said that first, Japan lacks stable foreign markets. Japan's trade volume with non-industrial countries such as Southeast Asia and Latin America fluctuates. Second, in Japan's export goods, consumer goods such as textiles and sundries account for a large proportion, and the need for these consumer goods often changes greatly due to the special circumstances of each year.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also said that the establishment of the European Common Market poses a new danger to Japan's trade.

The white paper calls for further expansion of Japan's exports and measures to limit the increase in imports.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 5th: According to a United Press report from Washington, U.S. officials said on the 4th that if Japan follows the United Kingdom in relaxing trade restrictions on China, "it may lose part of its profitable market in the United States."

These U.S. officials also expressed "belief" that Japan would not "take any action" on relaxing trade with China until Nobusuke Kishi had the opportunity to discuss this issue with U.S. officials during his visit to Washington this month.

    贸易入超大量增加　国际收支赤字增长
    日本三团体要求政府撤销“禁运”
    美国官员恫吓日本不得效法英国的行动
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日中输出入协会今天举行联席会议，决定要求日本政府采取撤销对中国禁运的措施，增进日中贸易。这三个同日中贸易有关的团体认为，英国采取了单独放宽对中国的禁运的行动，势必严重地影响到日本的对中国贸易。三团体将派代表会见岸信介首相，敦促他就缔结第四次日中贸易协定问题及早决定态度，并且要求他给予协助。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：通商产业省在昨天发表的1956年贸易情况白皮书中说，日本的进出口贸易在去年都曾经达到战后的最高峰：出口比前一年增加了24％，共达二十五亿美元；进口比前一年增加了31％，即增加了七亿六千万美元，共达三十二亿美元。过去三年间出口贸易的显著增加使工商业“空前地活跃”。
    但是，白皮书指出，尽管如此，日本的出口在去年只达到战前水平的86％，而进口却比战前增加了14％。由于进口的大量增加，日本的国际收支在去年产生了不平衡现象。
    通商产业省在这份白皮书中承认，日本目前的对外贸易是不稳定的。它说，首先，日本缺乏稳定的国外市场。日本同东南亚和拉丁美洲等非工业国的贸易量升降不定。其次，在日本的出口货物中，纺织品和杂货等消费品占很大的比重，而对这些消费品的需要往往因为每年的特殊情况而有很大的变化。
    通商产业省还说，欧洲共同市场的建立对日本贸易形成了新的危险。
    白皮书要求进一步扩大日本的出口，并且采取限制进口增加的措施。
    据新华社5日讯　据合众社华盛顿消息：美国官员4日说，如果日本效法英国放宽对中国的贸易限制，“它很可能丧失它在美国的一部分有利可图的市场”。
    这些美国官员还表示“相信”，在岸信介在本月内访问华盛顿期间有机会同美国官员讨论这个问题以前，日本不会在放宽对中国贸易的问题上“采取任何行动”。
