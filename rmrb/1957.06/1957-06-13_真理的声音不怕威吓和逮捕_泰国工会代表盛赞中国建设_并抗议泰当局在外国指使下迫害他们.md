    新华社12日讯  曼谷消息：最近曾经访问中国的七名泰国工会代表在6月5日回到曼谷时向报界发表谈话，盛赞中国的建设成就。
    泰国工会理事、工党领袖乃巴谷说，在一个月的访问中，中国给他留下了极其深刻的印象。他说，泰国工会代表团在中国访问期间，可以自由参观中国的任何一个地方。
    乃巴谷说，在中国人民的刻苦努力下，中国各方面的建设，尤其是在重工业、工人福利和社会福利保障等方面，都获得了非常巨大的成就。
    泰国的这七位工会代表在6月5日回到曼谷时，就被泰国警察当局逮捕。乃巴谷对警察当局的这一行动表示非常愤慨。他认为，警察当局逮捕他们，是出于外国所施加的压力。
    泰国访华工会代表团团长乃通锐和其他工会代表也都指出，现在中国大陆到处都在忙着建设工作，没有人谈论战争问题，从这个国家的每一个角落都发出和平的声音。他们认为，中国工人的生活过得很好。泰国民校教师联合会秘书长乃卡宗对记者们谈到了中国教育事业的进步情况。
