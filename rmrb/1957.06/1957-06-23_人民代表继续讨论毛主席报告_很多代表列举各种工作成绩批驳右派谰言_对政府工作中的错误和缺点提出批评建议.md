Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its preparatory meeting today, with group discussions on Chairman Mao Zedong's report, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

During the discussions, the deputies talked about the achievements in industrial and agricultural production, the strengthening of political and ideological education for young students, and offered criticisms of the government's work. Many deputies also used concrete facts to refute the reactionary statements of bourgeois rightists.

　　**Peasant Representatives Countless Benefits of Cooperativization**
　　**Not Allowing Rightist Elements to Find a Market in the Countryside**

Representatives from rural areas in Shandong, Sichuan, Guangdong, Anhui, and other provinces believe that the superiority of agricultural cooperativization cannot be denied. Lü Hongbin, a representative from Shandong Province and a model agricultural laborer, used his five years of experience in running a cooperative to illustrate this point. He said, some people say that cooperatives are not good, that the lives of farmers have been lowered. Do they think they are "clearer as bystanders"? Have they done serious investigation and research? Lü Hongbin spoke for more than an hour, saying that the living standards of the members have greatly improved, many have built new tiled houses, and the number of livestock has increased. The farmers say, "Joining a cooperative is worth ten more years of life, doing it alone is worth ten fewer years," they say this is because joining the cooperative saves both worry and effort. Lü Hongbin deeply realized that Chairman Mao's words that the cooperative will definitely be consolidated after three to five years are completely correct. He said that the farmers firmly oppose those who say the cooperative is not good.

Lü Hongbin also pointed out some shortcomings in the local agricultural cooperativization work. He said that when organizing cooperatives, some propaganda was inappropriate, and some cadres said to the farmers, "Join the cooperative, and you will have food and clothing." As a result, some farmers have a great reliance mentality, they do not pay attention to thrift and actively overcome difficulties, and when there are difficulties, they push them to the cooperative. He believes that this dependence mentality must be criticized, and farmers must be educated to cherish the cooperative in order to run the cooperative well.

Deng Fangzhi, deputy director of the Jiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, and mother of martyr Huang Jiguang, said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the production achievements of the Jiguang Agricultural Cooperative have increased year by year, and the income of each member has also increased. Now the households that lack grain and have no grain have been eliminated. Deng Fangzhi said, what is this if not the superiority of the cooperative?

Some rural representatives very angrily denounced the rightists. Wang Hanguo, a representative from Guangdong Province and a model agricultural laborer, said that their place is mountainous, and the agricultural cooperative he leads was short of grain the year before last, but last year it had surplus grain; last year, the average income of each member was more than 80 yuan, which was more than the upper-middle peasants of that year. Wang Hanguo said that if rightists go to the countryside to spread anti-Communist Party remarks, they will definitely be driven away by the farmers. Li Youan, director of the Shuangqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, said that Zhang Bojun was a people's representative elected from Anhui Province. When he came to the meeting this time, the farmers wanted him to ask Zhang Bojun what he was basing his opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism on.

Wu Huanyu (Miao nationality), representative from Hunan Province and head of Fenghuang County in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, used the changes in the political and living conditions of the Miao people in Xiangxi before and after liberation to illustrate the superiority of socialism. He said that the minority people resolutely oppose the anti-socialist conspiracy of the rightists. He said that the rightists' proposal not to have the leadership of the Communist Party and not to have socialism is a vain attempt to turn the wheel of history back to the days when our minority nationalities suffered hardship and oppression, and we resolutely oppose it.

　　**Overseas Chinese Representatives Talk About the Pain of Wandering Abroad in the Past**
　　**Overseas Chinese Have Been Respected by Foreigners Since the Founding of New China**

The representatives of the Overseas Chinese delegation, in the forum, criticized the reactionary remarks of the bourgeois rightists, and believed that the motherland must take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party. Some representatives said that in the old society, most of the overseas Chinese wandered overseas because they could not maintain their lives in the country. Old China was poor and weak, and the overseas Chinese could not hold their heads high abroad and were bullied by others. Since the founding of New China, the motherland has been renewed under the leadership of the Communist Party, its international status has been improved, and the overseas Chinese have also been respected by foreigners. The overseas Chinese have a very deep understanding of this point. Some representatives said that we are very proud to see Chinese films abroad, which reflect the achievements of socialist construction in the motherland. The overseas Chinese watched the motherland grow stronger day by day, and everyone loved the motherland even more. We must save more foreign exchange overseas to support the socialist construction of the motherland and resolutely oppose the fallacy of the rightists who do not want socialism.

Jin Baosheng, a Yao nationality representative from the Guangxi delegation, said that the rightists want to usurp the leadership of the Party and abolish the leadership of the Party, which is absolutely impossible. He said that he is a Yao nationality, and he knows that the Yao people, even three-year-old children, love the Communist Party and support the People's Government. The Yao people have come to the conclusion from the comparison between their past painful lives and today's happy lives: only under the leadership of the Communist Party can they live a good life.

Liu Changfu, director of the fourth branch of the Tianjin Steel Plant and a model industrial laborer, said that some people want to change the leadership of the working class. Our workers say, "It's better not to change it, and the people of the whole country will never allow it to be changed."

Sa Benxin, a representative of the Hubei delegation and chief engineer of the Wuchang Shipyard, said that great achievements have been made in all aspects of construction since liberation. He said that their factory had only two manual welding machines and the equipment was scarce and simple before liberation, but now, thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and the leadership of the Communist Party, not only has production greatly developed, but also all the equipment in the factory is incomparable to what it was before liberation.

In the Jiangsu delegation, the old poet Ke Zhongping spoke very indignantly, and he recited the poems he wrote in his labor praising socialist construction. He said that the bourgeois rightists attacked the Communist Party, the working class, and the people's democratic dictatorship from all sides, trying to steal the beams and pillars, seize the leadership of the working class, and dig out the foundation of the socialist building built by hundreds of millions of working people with their blood and sweat for many years. This is absolutely not allowed by us. We must defeat the attack of the rightists.

　　**Education Representatives Criticize Anarchist Tendencies Among Students**

Many representatives in their speeches criticized the current situation in colleges and universities where the political and ideological education of students is neglected. They believe that the anti-socialist thinking of a small number of students exposed recently in colleges and universities is a very noteworthy issue. Jiang Longji, a representative from Shandong Province and vice president of Peking University, talked about the situation of a small number of extremely arrogant bourgeois rightists among the students of Peking University. He said that a small number of students are influenced by anarchism, bourgeois ideology, and extreme individualism. They openly oppose socialism, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, scold old professors as "stupid" and "ignorant," and even spread rumors and spread reactionary remarks to universities in other schools and other cities. Jiang Longji said that this situation in schools has its social roots. The rightists inside and outside the school echo and influence each other, which deserves our serious attention.

Jiang Longji believes that in order to cultivate talents to serve the socialist cause, we must strengthen the political and ideological education of students, strengthen the Party's leadership over the school, and never abolish the Party's leadership.

Che Xiangchen, a representative from Heilongjiang Province, deputy governor of Liaoning Province, and an old educator, said that the political and ideological education in schools is currently too poor. He demanded that schools, agencies, factories, and rural areas strengthen political and ideological education.

At the group meeting of the Hebei delegation, Liu Qingyang, director of the Hebei Provincial Preparatory Committee of the China Democratic League, suggested publishing the History of the Communist Party of China and the Biography of the Martyrs of the Communist Party of China, so that the people can know the history of the Communist Party of China's arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, and let the people understand who can sacrifice their lives and everything for the happiness of the Chinese people.

　　**Many Representatives Criticize Shortcomings in Government Work**
　　**Demanding to Improve the Style of Cadres Through Rectification**

In the discussions of many groups, some representatives also offered opinions on the government's work.

Yan Renhai, a representative from Hunan Province and a model industrial worker, believes that there are shortcomings in the apprenticeship system, such as the apprentice's salary being too high. In his factory, it is 23 yuan upon entering the factory, which is very different from the income of farmers, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. He said that it is also too high to stipulate that the apprentice is a third-level worker after graduation. Li Chenggui, a model agricultural laborer, criticized the subjective style of some cadres, and he hoped that these shortcomings could be corrected through rectification.

Liu Yingyuan, a factory director of worker origin in the Beijing delegation, Liu Dezhen, an industrial labor model, and Li Shusen, chief engineer of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, all raised the issue of apprentice training at the Beijing Municipal Delegation meeting. They cited many examples to illustrate that some young workers at present despise labor, demand treatment, and do not work hard to study technology, and hope that relevant departments will decide to appropriately extend the apprenticeship period and strengthen ideological education, so that the trained workers can do the work of one top worker.

Writer Lao She raised the issue of excessive part-time jobs at the Beijing Municipal Delegation meeting, hoping that relevant departments would consider and resolve it reasonably.

Chairman Mao's report mentioned the overall consideration of 600 million people. The representatives believed that the population issue is a big issue, and in the future, we should strengthen the publicity and education of family planning in a good and meticulous manner, and there should be a special agency to manage this work.

Many group representatives criticized the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Luo Longji, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chu Anping, and others against socialism in their speeches.

Fei Xiaotong made a self-criticism at today's Jiangsu Delegation meeting. He said that the Taiwan newspapers published most of his article "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" and praised it. This shows that his position and ideological feelings are problematic, and he wrote what Taiwan needs. He said that in the past, he always protected his own and others' backward things and did not let them die; but the Taiwan side believed that these things would still develop and could be used by them. He said that he had run to the right, he felt very dangerous, and he wanted to change.

　　人民代表继续讨论毛主席报告
    很多代表列举各种工作成绩批驳右派谰言
    对政府工作中的错误和缺点提出批评建议
    据新华社22日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天继续举行预备会议，分组讨论毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告。
    代表们在讨论中谈到了工、农业生产的成就问题，加强对青年学生的政治思想教育问题，并且对政府工作提出了批评。许多代表还通过各种具体事实来驳斥资产阶级右派分子的反动言论。
　　农民代表数不尽合作化的好处
    不让右派分子在农村中找市场
    山东、四川、广东、安徽等省来自农村的代表认为，农业合作化的优越性不容抹煞。山东省代表、农业劳动模范吕鸿宾通过自己五年办社的经验来说明这个问题。他说，有些人说合作社不好，说农民生活降低，他们是否认为自己“旁观者清”呢？是否经过认真的调查研究呢？吕鸿宾讲了一个多小时，他说，现在社员的生活水平都有了很大提高，很多人盖了新瓦房，牲畜增加了。农民这样说，“参加合作社多活十年，自己单干要少活十年”，他们说这是因为入了社既省心又省力。吕鸿宾深深体会到毛主席所说的合作社经过三、五年就一定能够巩固下来的话，是完全正确的。他说，那些说合作社不好的人，农民是坚决反对的。
    吕鸿宾也指出了当地农业合作化工作中的一些缺点。他说，在组织合作社的时候，有的宣传得不恰当，有的干部对农民说，“入了合作社，就有吃有穿”。结果有的农民依赖思想很大，他们不注意勤俭节约，不积极克服困难，有了困难就推给合作社。他认为必须批判这种依赖思想，教育农民爱护合作社，才能把社办好。
    四川省中江县继光农业生产合作社副社长，黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝说，在共产党的领导下，继光农业社的生产成绩逐年增加，每个社员的收入也都增加了，现在缺粮户和无粮户已经消灭。邓芳芝说，这不是合作社的优越性是什么？
    有些农村来的代表非常气愤地指斥右派分子。广东省代表、农业劳动模范汪汉国说，他们那里是山地，他领导的农业社前年还缺粮，去年就有余粮了；去年每个社员平均收入八十多元，比当年的上中农还多。汪汉国说，右派分子如果到乡下去散播反对共产党的言论，一定会被农民赶走。安徽省宣城县双桥农业合作社主任李有安说，章伯钧是安徽省选出的人民代表。他这次来开会，农民们要他问问章伯钧根据什么来反对共产党的领导和社会主义。
    湖南省代表、湘西苗族自治州的凤凰县县长吴焕彧（苗族）用湘西苗族人民解放前后政治、生活变化的情况，说明了社会主义的优越性。他表示少数民族人民坚决反对右派分子反社会主义的阴谋。他说，右派分子提出不要共产党的领导，不要社会主义，是妄想把历史的车轮扭回到让我们少数民族受苦难、压迫的日子里去，我们坚决反对。
　　华侨代表诉述过去流浪国外的痛苦
    新中国成立后华侨受到了外国人尊重
    华侨代表小组的代表们，在座谈中批判了资产阶级右派分子的反动言论，认为祖国必须在共产党领导下走社会主义道路。有的代表说，在旧社会里，华侨大都是因为在国内没法维持生活才流浪海外。旧中国人穷国弱，华侨在国外抬不起头来，受人家欺负。新中国成立后，祖国在共产党领导下焕然一新，国际地位提高了，华侨也受到了外国人尊重。华侨对这一点体会非常深刻。有的代表说，我们在国外看到中国电影感到很骄傲，它反映了祖国社会主义建设的成就。华侨眼看着祖国一天比一天强盛起来，大家更加热爱祖国了。我们要在海外节约更多的外汇，支援祖国的社会主义建设，坚决反对右派分子不要社会主义的谬论。
    广西代表组瑶族人民代表金宝生说，右派分子想篡夺党的领导，取消党的领导，这是万万不行的。他说，他是瑶族，他知道瑶族人民连三岁小孩子都热爱共产党，拥护人民政府。瑶族人民从自己过去的痛苦生活和今天的幸福生活对比中得出一个结论：只有共产党的领导，他们才能过好日子。
    天津钢厂四分厂主任、工业劳动模范刘长福说，有人想要把工人阶级的领导换一换。我们工人说：“还是不换好，全国人民也绝不容许换”。
    湖北代表小组代表、武昌造船厂总工程师萨本炘说，解放以后各方面建设都有很大成绩。他说他们这个厂解放以前只有两部手焊机，设备少而简陋，而现在由于苏联的帮助和共产党的领导，不但生产有了巨大发展，同时厂内的一切装备也是解放前所无法比拟的。
    在江苏代表组，老诗人柯仲平发言时非常激愤，他朗诵了他在劳动中写的歌颂社会主义建设的诗。他说，资产阶级右派从各方面进攻共产党，进攻工人阶级，进攻人民民主专政，要偷梁换柱，夺取工人阶级的领导权，想挖掉几万万劳动人民多少年来流血流汗所建造起来的社会主义大厦的基础，这是我们绝对不许可的，我们一定要打退右派分子的进攻。
    教育界代表批判学生中无政府主义倾向
    许多代表在发言中都批评了目前高等学校中忽视对学生的政治思想教育工作的情况，他们认为最近在高等院校中暴露的少数学生反社会主义思想是一个十分值得注意的问题。山东省代表、北京大学副校长江隆基谈了北京大学学生中一小部分极端狂妄的资产阶级右派分子的情况，他说，有小部分学生受了无政府主义思想、资产阶级思想以及极端的个人主义思想的影响，他们公然反对社会主义，反对人民民主专政、反对共产党的领导，谩骂老教授“愚蠢”、“无知”，甚至制造谣言，向外校和其他城市的大学散布反动言论。江隆基说，学校中这种情况是有其社会根源的，校内校外的右派分子相互呼应，相互影响，这就值得我们严重注意。
    江隆基认为，为了培养为社会主义事业服务的人材，就必须对学生加强政治思想教育，加强党对学校的领导，而绝不是取消党的领导。
    黑龙江省代表、辽宁省副省长、老教育家车向忱说，目前学校中政治思想教育太差。他要求学校、机关、工厂、农村都要加强政治思想教育工作。
    在河北省代表的小组会上，中国民主同盟河北省筹备委员会主任刘清扬建议出版中国共产党史和中国共产党烈士传，让人民知道中国共产党人艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲的历史，让人民了解谁能为中国人民的幸福而牺牲自己的性命和一切。
　　许多代表批评政府工作中的缺点
    要求通过整风改进干部的作风
    许多小组在讨论中，有的代表还对政府工作提出了意见。
    湖南省代表、工业劳动模范言仁海认为学徒制度上有缺点，如学徒工资过高，以他所在的工厂来讲，一进厂就是二十三元，和农民的收入悬殊很大，引起了农民不满。他说，学徒毕业后就是三级工也规定得太高了。农业劳动模范李呈桂批评了有些干部的主观主义作风，他希望通过整风这些缺点能够得到纠正。
    北京代表小组工人出身的工厂厂长刘英源、工业劳动模范刘德珍和长辛店机车车辆修理工厂总工程师李树森等都在北京市代表小组会上提出关于学徒工的培养问题。他们举出许多事例说明目前的青年工人中有些人轻视劳动、闹待遇、不刻苦钻研技术，希望有关部门决定适当地延长学徒年限，加强思想教育，使培养出来的工人能一个顶一个的干活。
    作家老舍在北京市代表小组会上提出兼职过多的问题，希望有关部门考虑予以合理解决。
    毛主席的报告中曾谈到对六亿人口的统筹兼顾问题。代表们认为人口问题是一个大问题，今后应该很好地细致地加强节育的宣传教育，并且有专门机构来管理这一工作。
    许多小组代表在发言中批判了章伯钧、章乃器、罗隆基、龙云、黄绍竑、储安平等人反社会主义的错误言论。
    费孝通在今天的江苏代表小组会上作了自我批评。他说，台湾报纸把他所写的“知识分子的早春天气”一文大部分刊用了，并且加以赞扬。这说明了他的立场和思想感情都是有问题的，他写了台湾方面所需要的东西。他说，他过去总是保护自己的和别人的落后的东西，不让它们死掉；而台湾方面却认为这些东西还会发展，并可供他们利用。他说，他已经向右跑了，他感到很危险，要转变过来。
