Shenyang and Anshan Workers Hold Separate Symposiums
We are of One Life and One Heart with the Communist Party

(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 9th dispatch) The news of Lu Yuwen receiving an anonymous threatening letter, and the anti-socialist fallacies expressed by some people in the newspapers recently, have aroused great indignation in this mechanical industrial city of Shenyang. On the morning of June 9th, the trade union of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory held a symposium attended by 16 people, including workers, engineers, workshop directors, and trade union workers. At the meeting, they vehemently denounced the vile act of writing anonymous threatening letters and seriously criticized those anti-socialist fallacies.

　　Shan Tongwu, an eighth-grade boring worker from the No. 3 Machining Workshop, said: I am an ordinary worker, and I am not a Communist Party member, but I know that we workers are of one life and one heart with the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no today for us. If anyone wants to oppose the Communist Party, such a person is our mortal enemy. But now some people are spreading fallacies, saying that it is okay to not have the Communist Party, and they send anonymous threatening letters to those who express correct opinions and genuinely help the Communist Party in the rectification campaign, trying to shut their mouths. I say that these people are without conscience. They have no intention of helping the Communist Party at all. Instead, they want to take advantage of critical moments and are only satisfied if they can bring down the Communist Party. We say that socialism is good and the Communist Party is good, but they insist on saying it is not good. Take me, for example. I worked as a child laborer in a tobacco factory at the age of twelve, and the money I earned in a month was only enough to fill my stomach for half a month. I still have a photo of myself when I was fourteen or fifteen, dressed like a madman. Now, there is simply no comparison. Now I am an eighth-grade worker, and my basic salary alone is more than one hundred yuan. I eat and use everything adequately. I studied for four years in the past, and now I have completed junior high school algebra in spare-time school and am about to study in high school. You tell me, where did this life come from? Can it work without the Communist Party? Anyone who says they don't want the Communist Party, who wants to separate us from the Communist Party, we must wage a merciless struggle against them.

　　Gong Qiuchu, technical director and engineer of the foundry workshop, said: These days, reading the People's Daily every night has become the first thing I do when I get home. I learned about someone writing a threatening letter to Lu Yuwen last night. Now many people feel that our country is very peaceful, and it seems that there is no need for vigilance. However, the incident of Lu Yuwen receiving a threatening letter shows that we cannot be so complacent. We help the Party in the rectification campaign, and any opinions can be expressed. Our criticism of the Party's shortcomings is not opposition to the Party's leadership, but to help the Party. Why resort to the despicable means of writing threatening letters? Chu Anping is the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily. He is the editor-in-chief of such a large newspaper, and I think it is very dangerous. His "Party's World" statement, I think, is not to sincerely help the Party in the rectification campaign, but has ulterior motives.

　　Cao Hongtu, a worker from the pattern-making workshop, said: Chu Anping's talk of "Party's World" is even more nonsense. We have two directors in our workshop, only one of whom is a Party member, and none of the three section chiefs are Party members. How can this be said to be all Party members? If you don't support the Communist Party, we, the broad masses of the people, will support it. You harbor a hostile attitude, slander the Communist Party, and want to discredit the Communist Party in the eyes of the people, but we wholeheartedly support it.

　　Hu Bingzheng, deputy section chief and assistant engineer of the design section, said: Lu Yuwen expressed some different opinions, and he was threatened, abused, and some people wrote threatening letters to him. What kind of behavior is this? This is very shameful behavior. In the past, I worked on the railway. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Baoji to Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway was described by the locals as "Bao-Tian Road, messing around, if it doesn't collapse, it derails." But after liberation, the situation was very different. Not only was the Bao-Tian Road repaired, but many new railways were built. My home is in Henan. During the Kuomintang and Japanese rule, the disasters of "water, drought, locusts, and Tang Enbo's army" starved how many people to death? Since liberation, who has heard of so many people starving to death? The people's lives are guaranteed, is that not a fact? Can it be said that the Communist Party's leadership is not good? These are all evil winds and bad influences, and they should be overthrown.

### 沈阳、鞍山工人分别举行座谈  我们和共产党是一条命一条心

    沈阳、鞍山工人分别举行座谈
    我们和共产党是一条命一条心
    本报沈阳9日电　卢郁文收到匿名恐吓信的消息和近来报纸上发表的有些人的反社会主义的谬论，在这个机械工业之城——沈阳引起了极大的激愤。9日上午沈阳第一机床厂的工会举行了有工人、工程师、车间主任、工会工作者等十六人参加的座谈会，会上痛斥了写匿名恐吓信的恶劣行为，对于那些反社会主义的谬论进行了严肃的批驳。
    三号机械加工车间八级镗工单同武说：我是一个普通的工人，我不是共产党员，但是我知道我们工人兄弟和共产党是一条命、一条心，没有共产党就没有我们的今天。如果有人要反对共产党，这种人就是我们的死敌。但是现在就是有些人在发谬论，说不要共产党也可以，而且对发表正确意见、真正帮助共产党整风的人，就发匿名恐吓信，想封住他们的嘴巴。我说这些人是坏良心，他们根本不是打算来帮助共产党的，而是等到紧要关头的时候，他们就要钻空子，这些人是想把共产党整下台才甘心的。我们说社会主义好，共产党好，但是他们偏偏要说不好。就拿我来说，十二岁到烟厂当童工，一个月赚的钱只能填饱半个月的肚子。现在还留着一张十四五岁时照的照片，穿的就像个疯子一样。现在呢，这简直没有办法比。现在我是八级工，光基本工资就一百多元，吃的用的都很圆满。过去我念过四年书，现在我在业余学校已念完初中代数，就要念高中。你说现在日子是从那里来的？没有共产党能行吗？谁说不要共产党，想把我们和共产党拆开来的人，我们一定要跟它展开无情的斗争。
  　铸造车间技术主任、工程师龚求初说：这些日子以来，每天晚上看人民日报成了我回家后第一件事情。我是在昨天晚上知道有人给卢郁文写恐吓信的。现在有许多人觉得我们的天下已经很太平了，好像觉得用不着什么警惕性了，可是卢郁文收到恐吓信的事件说明我们还不能这样高枕无忧。我们帮助党整风，什么意见都可以讲，我们批评党的缺点，不是反对党的领导，而是为了帮助党。为什么要采取卑鄙的手段写恐吓信？储安平是光明日报的总编辑，他做这样大的报纸的总编辑，我看很危险。他的“党天下”的说法，我看就不是为了诚心诚意帮助党整风，是别有用意的。
    木型车间工人曹洪图说：储安平说“党天下”的话更是扯淡，我们车间有两个主任，只有一个是党员，三个段长没有一个是党员，这怎么能说是清一色？你们不拥护共产党，我们广大人民都拥护。你们抱着敌视的态度，污蔑共产党，想把共产党在人民群众中弄得威信扫地，可我们却是衷心拥护。
    设计科副科长、助理工程师胡秉政说，卢郁文发表了一些不同的意见，就被威胁、谩骂，还有人给他写恐吓信，这些是什么行为？这是非常可耻的行为。过去，我曾在铁路上工作过，在国民党反动统治时代，陇海路宝鸡到天水一段，当地人形容它是“宝天路，瞎胡闹，不塌方，就掉道”。可是解放后，情况就大为不同，不但宝天路修好了，而且又有很多新的铁路修了起来。我家是在河南，在国民党和日本人统治时期，“水、旱、蝗、汤”的灾害，饿死过多少人？解放以后，谁听说过饿死过多少人？人民的生活有了保障，难道不是事实？这能说共产党领导的不好？这些都是歪风邪气，应该把它打倒。
