Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Marvin Stone, the head of the United Press International Far East Bureau, reported from Tokyo today that the background to the Taiwan incident exists almost universally in Asian countries.

Stone said, "This Taiwan incident could happen tomorrow in Tokyo, Bangkok, Seoul, or Singapore. The reason is neither mysterious nor too complex to express simply." It is: "Asians demand that 'white men' treat them as equals and respect them. They are tired of the inferiority complex that has been forced upon them for two centuries." "Asians, who have suffered colonial humiliation, are looking forward to the day of revenge. White men are seen as arrogant and ignorant."

Stone said the Taipei incident "exposed deep-seated resentment." For example, in Thailand, "when people mention Americans, they mockingly call them 'thugs,' saying they are troublemakers, braggarts, and in a sense, almost like murderers. Other Asian countries have different sayings about Americans, and most of them are not complimentary."

Stone pointed out, "These sayings are not necessarily instigated by the Communists. Everyone acknowledges that these sayings are due to the Americans re-enacting the greed of white men towards Asia centuries ago."

Stone admitted, "One hundred billion dollars may not necessarily make friends if there is only money without respect and understanding." He said, "Asians who are willing to speak frankly are adamant that the United States still wants to perpetuate many of the ills of European colonialism for decades to come."

Stone said, "Americans simply do not know how to get along with Asians. They unintentionally flaunt their wealth, and in some countries—Korea, Japan, and Taiwan—they maintain a 'sense of occupation.' Undoubtedly, some of them are loud, brash, and rude, and they isolate themselves from the 'locals,' keeping their distance."

He continued, "However, what causes resentment is mainly: they insist on obtaining extraterritorial rights, which Asians consider the most unjust of the gunboat era. In the East, this is called privilege." He pointed out, "When Americans in Congress and across the United States express the need to protect Americans from foreign courts, Asians are even more determined to abolish what they consider a fundamental infringement on their own sovereignty."

Stone revealed that the Taiwan incident left American diplomatic officials in Asia "shocked, saddened, and angry because the attack on their embassy did not happen elsewhere but precisely in Taiwan, which receives generous American aid." He "regrettably" pointed out to these American diplomats that in Asia, the people and governments' attitude towards American "aid" is "not always consistent."

Stone concluded by saying that the Taipei people's "disturbance is to oppose thugs and their privileges. Long after the U.S. Embassy in Taipei is repaired, Asia will watch the example of Taipei."

    亚洲人民对美国佬毫无好感
    台北事件也可能在别处发生
    美国国际新闻社远东分社社长承认美元难买友谊
    新华社8日讯　美国国际新闻社远东分社社长马文·斯通今天从东京发出的消息说：台湾事件的背景几乎在亚洲各国中都同样地存在着。
    斯通说，“这一次的台湾事件，明天也可能在东京、曼谷、汉城或者新加坡发生。原因既不奥妙也并不是复杂得无法简单表达”，它就是：“亚洲人要求‘白种人’平等看待他们，尊重他们。他们厌倦了两世纪来迫使他们产生的自卑感。”“受尽殖民地耻辱的亚洲人盼望着报仇的日子，白种人是骄傲自大和愚昧无知的形象。”
    斯通说，台北事件就是“暴露了根深蒂固的愤恨。”又如在泰国，“人们提到美国人的时候，就嘲笑地说他们是‘恶棍’，说他们是闯祸精、吹牛的家伙、在某种意义上简直就像凶手。其他亚洲国家对美国人又有别的说法，而多半并不是夸奖。”
    斯通指出，“这些说法不一定是共产党指使的。大家都公认这些说法，是由于美国人重新表现了几个世纪以前白种人对亚洲的贪心”。
    斯通承认，“一百亿美元未见得就能结交朋友，如果只有美元而没有尊敬和谅解的话。”他说，“愿意开诚布公地谈话的亚洲人都坚决认为，美国还是要使几十年来欧洲殖民主义者的许多弊端永久存在下去。”
    斯通说，“美国人简直不懂得怎样同亚洲人相处。他们无意中炫耀财富，他们在有些国家——朝鲜、日本和台湾——保持一种‘占领意识’。毫无疑问，其中有一部分人是粗声粗气，东闯西撞和唐突无礼的，他们还使自己同‘当地人’隔离开来，相距万里。”
    他接着说，“然而引起愤恨的主要是：他们坚持要取得亚洲人认为是炮舰时代最不公正的治外法权。在东方，这被称为特权。”他指出：“当（美国）国会中和美国各地的美国人表示需要保护美国人不受外国法庭审判的时候，亚洲人加倍坚决地要取消他们认为是根本侵犯他们自己主权的东西。”
    斯通透露，台湾事件使亚洲的美国外交官员感到“震惊、伤心和愤怒，因为袭击他们大使馆的事件竟不发生在其他地方而独独发生在接受美国的慷慨援助的台湾。”他为这些美国外交官“遗憾地”指出，在亚洲，人民和政府对待美国的“援助”，态度“并不总是一致的”。
    斯通最后说，台北人民的“骚动是要反对恶棍和他的特权。在台北美国大使馆修复以后很长时间内亚洲将注视台北的榜样”。
