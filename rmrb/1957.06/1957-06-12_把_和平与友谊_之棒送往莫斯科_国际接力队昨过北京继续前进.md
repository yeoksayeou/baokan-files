　　Sending the "Peace and Friendship" Baton to Moscow
　　International Relay Team Passed Through Beijing Yesterday and Continues Forward

    (Our Newspaper) This morning, the four-nation international long-distance relay baton (an aluminum metal rod about eighty centimeters long and about ten centimeters thick, with the national flags of North Korea, China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union cast on it), symbolizing the desire of young people from North Korea, China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union for peace and friendship, arrived at Tiananmen Square at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, after a long relay of more than 1,600 kilometers from the signing hall of the Korean Armistice Agreement in Panmunjom. When Qi Lieyun, a swimmer and athlete holding the flag of the Chinese relay team, Li Jinyao, the champion of this year's Beijing Spring Ring Road Race holding the baton, and a relay team consisting of more than 50 athletes and more than 300 university students ran to Tiananmen Square, the surrounding crowd erupted in prolonged cheers and applause.
    Zhang Jinlin, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, took the baton and, in front of Tiananmen Square, where thousands of spectators and representatives of the embassies of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were gathered, placed two congratulatory letters from the 800,000 young people of Beijing to the youth of Ulaanbaatar and Moscow into the relay baton. The "Peace and Friendship" baton was then carried westward by a relay team of more than 200 young people from the Qianmen, Chongwen, and Xuanwu districts.
    Tens of thousands of people beat gongs and drums on both sides of the road, cheering to their hearts' content. Led by a motorcycle team bearing national flags and badges of the festival, the relay baton passed through five relay points, including Xidan, Xisi, Pinganli, Xihuangchenggen, and Desheng Bridge, and arrived at Deshengmen at 5:20 p.m. There, Xie Shouchun, a student at Tsinghua University and the champion of last year's Beijing Motorcycle Obstacle Race, took the baton from Li Chunfang, a worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. A relay team of sixteen athletes driving thirteen motorcycles took on the lofty task of passing on this "Peace and Friendship" baton, heading straight for Badaling, where the Great Wall stands. At this time, the members of the Beijing First Horseshoe Production Cooperative and the masses, who came out of the workshop with tools in their hands, applauded and cheered.
    The sixteen motorcyclists spent the night in Changping yesterday and will continue their journey at 8:00 a.m. today. It is expected that they will arrive at Badaling at 9:00 a.m., where they will hand over the baton to the youth of Yanqing County, Hebei, and then pass it into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and arrive at the Sino-Mongolian border on the 19th. At that time, the youth of China and Mongolia will hold a grand get-together in Zamyn-Üüd on the Sino-Mongolian border.
    This "Peace and Friendship" baton was handed over to the Beijing relay team bicycle team by the Tongxian relay team at the Tongxian Normal School playground at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. A simple ceremony was held there. Zhang Qingji, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yang Wenbin, Secretary of the Tongxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and representatives of the two teams spoke, and Zhou Shixian, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, took the relay baton from Yuan Zhenyi, a member of the Tongxian relay team, and handed it to Zhang Shengzhu, a female cyclist and athlete of the Beijing bicycle team. After the ceremony, all members of the Tongxian relay team shouted in unison: "Please bring peace and friendship to Moscow." The sixty-four cyclists and sixteen motorcyclists from Beijing replied in unison: "We will definitely bring peace and friendship to Moscow." At three o'clock sharp, the cyclists set off from Tongxian Men's Normal School and drove straight towards Beijing, with crowds waving flags, jumping, applauding and cheering along the way. When they arrived at Guandongdian, Gao Ling, a textile worker and advanced producer from Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 wearing a pink sportswear, took the relay baton from Zhang Shengzhu and ran towards the city escorted by more than 60 textile workers from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and No. 2, and handed the baton to a team of suburban farmers at Dongdaqiao, passing through the three relay points of Chaoyangmen, Dongsi, and Dongdan. The "Peace and Friendship" baton finally reached the great Tiananmen Square.
    More than 2,000 people participated in the relay yesterday, including workers, farmers, students, primary and secondary school teachers, young teaching assistants, and young people from industry and commerce, religious circles, and returned overseas Chinese. There were as many as 600,000 cheering people along the way.

　　把“和平与友谊”之棒送往莫斯科
　　国际接力队昨过北京继续前进
    本报讯  象征着朝鲜、中国、蒙古、苏联四国青年对和平与友谊愿望的四国国际长途接力棒（一支长约八十公分粗约十公分上面铸有朝、中、蒙、苏四国国旗的铝制金属棒），从朝鲜板门店停战协定签字大厅起，经过了一千六百多公里的长途接力后，昨天下午四点半到达了天安门。当高举着中国接力队队旗的游泳运动员、运动健将戚烈云，拿着接力棒的今年北京市春季环城赛跑冠军李进尧和一支由五十多名运动健将、三百多名大学生组成的接力队伍跑到天安门时，周围的群众发出了经久不息的欢呼声和掌声。
    青年团北京市委第二书记张进霖接过棒后，在聚集着几千观众与苏联、蒙古人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义共和国大使馆代表的天安门前，将北京市八十万青年致乌兰巴托与莫斯科青年的两封贺信装入接力棒中。这支“和平与友谊”之棒便由前门、崇文、宣武三个区二百多青年组成的接力队拿着，继续往西跑去。
    成千上万的群众在道路两旁敲锣打鼓，尽情地欢呼。接力棒在挂着国旗和装载着联欢节会徽的摩托车队伍的引导下，经过了西单、西四、平安里、西皇城根、德胜桥等五个接力点，于五点二十分来到了德胜门。在那里去年北京市摩托车障碍赛冠军、清华大学学生谢寿椿从石景山钢铁厂工人李春芳手里接过接力棒后，一支由十六个运动员组成的驾驶着十三辆摩托车的接力队伍，负起了传递这支“和平与友谊”之棒的崇高任务，直向耸立着万里长城的八达岭挺进，这时从车间里走出来手里还拿着工具的北京市第一马掌生产合作社社员们和群众齐齐鼓掌欢送。
    十六名摩托车运动员昨天晚上在昌平过夜，今天八时将继续前进，预计在九时到达八达岭，在那里将接力棒转交河北延庆县青年，然后传入内蒙古自治区，19日可到达中、蒙边境。那时候中、蒙两国青年将在中、蒙边境的札门乌得上举行盛大的联欢会。
    这支“和平与友谊”之棒，是在昨天下午二点半由通县接力队在通县师范学校大操场上交给北京市接力队自行车队的。在那里曾经举行了一个简单的仪式。中共北京市委宣传部副部长张青季、中共通县县委书记杨文彬和两队代表都讲了话，并由共青团北京市委副书记周世贤从通县接力队队员袁振义手中接过接力棒交给北京市自行车女运动员、运动健将张胜竹。仪式完了后，通县接力队全体队员齐声高呼：“请你们把和平与友谊带到莫斯科。”北京市六十四名自行车运动员和十六名摩托车运动员齐声答道：“我们一定把和平与友谊带到莫斯科”三时整，自行车运动员从通县男子师范学校出发直向北京城里驶来，沿途夹道欢迎的群众摇旗跳跃、鼓掌欢呼。到了关东店，穿着粉红色运动服的北京国棉二厂纺织女工、先进生产者高玲从张胜竹手里接过接力棒，在六十多名国棉一、二厂纺织女工的护送下向城里跑去，在东大桥将棒交给了郊区农民的队伍，经过了朝阳门、东四、东单三个接力点。这支“和平与友谊”之棒终于传到了伟大的天安门。
    昨天参加接力的共有两千多人，其中有工人、农民、学生、中小学教师、青年助教和工商界、宗教界、归国华侨的青年。夹道欢呼的群众共有六十万人之多。
