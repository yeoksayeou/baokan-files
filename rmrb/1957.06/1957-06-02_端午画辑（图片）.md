    Dragon Boat Festival Pictorial
    The 5th day of the 5th lunar month, an ancient mid-heaven festival, commonly known as the Dragon Boat Festival, also called the Double Fifth Festival. According to folk customs, on this day, every household inserts artemisia and calamus swords in front of their doors and hangs Zhong Kui's image indoors to ward off evil. People eat zongzi, drink realgar wine, and watch dragon boat races or go boating for fun. Theaters stage seasonal plays. On the occasion of the Dragon Boat Festival, a special collection of several Ming and Qing dynasty woodblock prints is provided for readers to enjoy. (A Ying)
    Dragon Boat Races
    The custom of dragon boat racing is most popular during the Dragon Boat Festival. The boats are narrow and long, decorated with dragon heads and tails, flying flags and banners. The middle cabin houses drummers and wind musicians, while the oarsmen on both sides usually number up to a dozen, competing against each other. There are also performances of historical stagecraft in the boats, showcasing various skills.

    Mourning Qu Yuan
    The ancient great poet Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River on the Dragon Boat Festival. Later generations mourned him, so on this day, they hold ceremonies to summon his soul and mourn him. Therefore, an earlier poem says: "Miluo died three thousand years ago, souls are summoned and sacrifices are made before the Dragon Boat Festival."

    Hanging Zhong Kui Pictures
    In the old customs, every household hangs Zhong Kui pictures during the Dragon Boat Festival to ward off epidemics. Legend has it that Zhong Kui was a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) from Zhongnan Mountain during his lifetime. His image is described as: "Eyes like lacquer, hair like dragons, lips like bloody red, beard like halberds." He was very kind and liked to fight ghosts to protect people. The earliest person to paint his portrait was the famous Tang Dynasty painter Wu Daozi. Therefore, on this day, theaters also perform the seasonal plays "Zhong Kui Marries His Sister" or "Five Ghosts Create Havoc in the Underworld."

    Performing Seasonal Plays
    During the Dragon Boat Festival, theaters usually stage the full-length seasonal play "Legend of the White Snake." Some only perform a few wonderful excerpts such as "Realgar Array," "Stealing the Immortal Herb," and "Flooding Jinshan Temple."

    端午画辑
    农历5月5日，古中天节，俗称端午，又称端阳节。民间风俗，这一天，家家门前插艾虎蒲剑，室内挂钟馗像辟邪。食粽，饮雄黄酒，看龙舟竞赛或者泛舟游乐。剧场都上演应时戏。时值端午，特辑印数幅明、清版画，供读者欣赏。　（阿英）
    龙舟竞渡
    端午划龙船风俗最盛。船狭长，装龙头龙尾，扬旌拽旗，中舱伏鼓吹手，两旁划桨者，一般多至十数人，互相竞赛。船中并有扮演台阁故事，表演各种技艺的。上图：明万历“龙舟图”（木刻）悼念屈原
    古代伟大诗人屈原，于端午自沉于汨罗江。后人哀之，于是日为之招魂悼念。故前人诗云：“汨罗已死三千年，招魂野祭端阳前”。

    旧时风俗，端午家家挂钟馗图，以驱疫疠。相传钟馗生前是终南山进士，他的像貌是：“眼如点漆发如虬，唇如腥红髯如戟”。很善良，喜击鬼以卫人。最早为之画像的，是唐朝名画家吴道子。故戏园是日也有演“钟馗嫁妹”或“五鬼闹判”应时的。右上图：金冬心绘“钟馗图”石刻；左下图：清桃花坞年画演应时戏
    端午节，各戏园例演应时戏全本“白蛇传”，亦有只演“雄黄阵”、“盗仙草”和“水漫金山”几出精彩单折的。上图：清桃花坞木刻“盗仙草”
