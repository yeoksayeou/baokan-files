Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th. As of now, the total output value of more than 150 factories and mines in Yunnan Province has exceeded the Five-Year Plan target by more than 13%.

　　The total output of twenty-four major products in the province has also successively exceeded the level of the first Five-Year Plan.

　　In the past four years, Yunnan Province's non-ferrous metal industry and local industries have seen considerable development; the output of raw coal, which serves as power, has also grown rapidly. Geological workers have discovered more than eighty small coal mines and the largest lignite field in the country in the province. Industrial departments have established small-scale coal mining sites in more than sixty locations, completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule; so far, the production of raw coal has increased by more than 250,000 tons. Geological workers have also conducted phosphate mine surveys in more than forty counties, discovering more than ten small phosphate mines and the largest Kunyang phosphate mine in the country. Most counties with phosphate mines have engaged in small-scale mining, increasing the output of phosphate rock powder by forty-seven times that of the first Five-Year Plan.

　　The production of various metal-cutting machine tools needed for many key construction projects in the country has also exceeded seven times that of the first Five-Year Plan. More than forty Model 262Γ horizontal boring machines produced by the Kunming Machine Tool Plant have supported the construction of more than thirty key projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company in recent years, and have participated in exhibitions in more than a dozen countries including Japan and France. Ethnic minority women in Yunnan like to weave cloth themselves using cotton yarn. After the output of cotton yarn reached the level of the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule at the beginning of this year, the supply of cotton yarn has increased by more than double compared to 1952.

　　四十七倍
    云南磷矿生产突飞猛进
    原煤、机床和棉纱产量也有很大增长
    新华社昆明24日电　截至目前为止，云南省内一百五十多个厂矿企业的总产值已超过五年计划指标13％以上。
    全省有二十四种主要产品的总产量，也陆续超过了第一个五年计划的水平。
    过去四年中，云南省的有色金属工业和地方工业都有不小的发展；作为动力的原煤产量增长也很快。地质工作人员在全省发现了八十多个小煤矿和目前国内最大的褐煤田。工业部门在六十多个地方建立了小型的掘煤场，提前一年完成了五年计划；到目前为止，已增产原煤二十五万吨以上。地质工作人员还在四十多个县里普查了磷矿，发现了十多个小磷矿和全国最大的昆阳磷矿。大多数有磷矿的县都进行了小型的开采，使磷灰石粉的产量超过了第一个五年计划的四十七倍。
    为国内许多重点建设工程需要的各种金属切削机床的生产量，也超过了第一个五年计划的七倍以上。昆明机床厂生产的四十多台二六二Γ型卧式镗床，几年来支援了鞍山钢铁公司等三十多个重点工程的建设，并且先后到日本、法国等十几个国家参加展览。云南的少数民族妇女喜欢用棉纱自己织布。今年初棉纱的产量提前一年达到第一个五年计划的水平以后，棉纱的供应量已比1952年增加一倍多。
