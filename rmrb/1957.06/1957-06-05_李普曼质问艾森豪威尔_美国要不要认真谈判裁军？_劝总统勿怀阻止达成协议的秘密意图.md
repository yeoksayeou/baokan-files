Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th - American political commentator Walter Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 1st, saying that the American President must now answer this question: does he want to seriously begin negotiating disarmament?

The article, entitled "A Major Decision," stated that Stassen's report from London, stating that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to reach an agreement and is not merely making speeches, presents the United States with a "very new thing." Previously, "we always believed that neither side truly believed reaching an agreement was possible, therefore we could all casually put forward suggestions without seriously asking ourselves: if the Russians accepted these suggestions, what would we do?" Now, a serious request for negotiation is before Eisenhower. Lippmann points out that the question here is: in this potentially achievable limited agreement, will the United States risk the "political risk of easing tensions?" Lippmann said that if you agree to limit armaments, "then you are actually accepting the current division of the world." Any agreement reached on the disarmament issue is tantamount to a military guarantee of the existing military demarcation between the two camps. This agreement would cause a reduction of the heavy sense of unease in Western Europe – including West Germany – and encourage demands within the United States for budget cuts. However, in Lippmann's view, the risks and costs of not negotiating may be even greater. The previous two American presidents frequently declared that the United States hoped to reach an agreement. In the past, "responsible people have talked too much, and the President cannot now adopt an attitude against a disarmament agreement." "The President can argue about the content of any individual agreement. But he must argue seriously, that is, with the hope of reaching an agreement rather than harboring a secret intention to prevent an agreement."

Lippmann concluded by saying that the argument against reaching an agreement is based on a "strange and dangerous assumption." This assumption is: "If tensions ease, if the fear of war decreases, then the Communist countries will benefit and the non-Communist countries will be disadvantaged." Lippmann said: "Is this our true assessment of the world? Do we truly believe that as fear, anxiety, and tension decrease, we will decline, while totalitarian countries will prosper?"
	"Indeed, this assumption itself is a symptom of the existing tensions, and it shows an extreme lack of confidence in our own system and in our own people."

    李普曼质问艾森豪威尔
    美国要不要认真谈判裁军？
    劝总统勿怀阻止达成协议的秘密意图
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：美国政论家李普曼1日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上写文章说，美国总统现在必须回答这样一个问题：他要不要认真开始谈判裁军？
    这篇以“一项重大的决定”为题的文章说，史塔生从伦敦回来报告说，苏联是真心希望达成协议的，不仅仅是发表演说，这使美国面临着一件“非常新鲜的事情”。以前，“我们总认为任何一方都不会真正相信达成协议是可能的，因此我们全都可以随便提出建议，而不必认真地自问一下：假若俄国人接受了这些建议的话，我们将作何想法。”现在，一项认真要求谈判的建议摆在艾森豪威尔面前了。李普曼指出，在这里，争论的问题是：在这种有可能达成的有限度的协议中，美国是否会冒“缓和紧张局势的政治风险”？李普曼说，如果你同意限制军备，“那你实际上就接受了目前世界的分裂局面”。在裁军问题上达成的任何协议等于是对两个阵营间现存的军事分界的一项军事保证。这种协议会引起减轻西欧——包括西德在内——的沉重的不安感和鼓励美国国内削减预算的要求等后果。可是，照李普曼的看法，不进行谈判的风险和代价可能会更大。美国的前任两位总统经常宣称美国希望达成协议，以往“负责人士谈得太多了，总统现在不可能采取一种反对一项裁军问题协议的态度。”“总统可以争论任何个别协议的内容。但是他必须认真地争论，也就是说，要怀着达成协议的希望而不是怀着一种阻止达成协议的秘不告人的意图。”
    李普曼最后说，反对达成协议的论点是建立在一种“奇怪而危险的假设上的”。这种假设是：“如果紧张局势缓和了、如果战争恐惧减少了，那么有利的将是共产党国家而不利的将是非共产党国家。”李普曼说：“难道这是我们对世界的真正估价吗？难道我们一定真正相信：随着恐惧、不安和紧张局势的减轻，我们就会衰落，而集权国家就会繁荣吗？” 
    “的确，这种假设的本身就是现存的紧张局势的一种病征，它表现出对我们自己的制度和对我们自己的人民极其缺乏信心。”
