　　Slaves Become Masters of Liangshan

According to Xinhua News Agency, the lives of the Yi people in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan are undergoing rapid changes. Since the end of 1955, after the Communist Party and the People's Government adopted peaceful consultation methods to carry out democratic reforms here, the Yi people began to move towards the life they had imagined in their mountain songs. The government provided loans to build new homes for them, distributed production tools to them, and helped them organize cooperatives. From then on, the Yi people here ended the inhuman life given to them by the slave system, and the liberated slaves became the masters of Liangshan. They have their own land and their own production tools; they have taken off the tattered clothes that symbolized slave life, the women wear red skirts, and the men have new clothes. Unprecedented phenomena have also appeared here: slave children are carrying their schoolbags to school; young people who have formed couples are no longer afraid that slave life will break up their marriages. The picture below shows a comparison of the lives of the Yi people before and after liberation.

　　奴隶成了凉山的主人
    据新华社讯　四川凉山彝族自治州彝族人民的生活正在日新月异的变化着。自1955年底，共产党和人民政府在这里采用和平协商方式进行民主改革后，彝族人民开始走向他们山歌里所幻想的生活。政府贷款为他们建造新居，发给他们生产工具，帮助他们组织合作社。从此，这里的彝族人民结束了奴隶制度给予他们的非人生活，被解放了的奴隶作了凉山的主人。他们有自己的土地，有自己的生产工具；他们脱下了标志奴隶生活的破不遮体的衣服，女人穿上红裙，男人有了新装。这里也出现了从未有过的现象，奴隶的孩子也背上书包上学校了；结成夫妇的年青人，再也不怕奴隶生活拆散他们的婚姻。下图就是彝族人民解放前后生活的对照。
