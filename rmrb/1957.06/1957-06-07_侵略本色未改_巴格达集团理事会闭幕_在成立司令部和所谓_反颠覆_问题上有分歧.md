    侵略本色未改
    巴格达集团理事会闭幕
    在成立司令部和所谓“反颠覆”问题上有分歧
    据新华社卡拉奇6日电　巴格达条约理事会会议今天下午在卡拉奇闭幕。
    会议结束后发表的新闻公报为这个服务于帝国主义利益的军事集团辩护说：“巴格达条约纯粹是朋友们防御性的联合。”公报说：“理事会遗憾地注意到，某些国家政府对于像巴格达条约这样的集体防御安排却采取了积极的反对态度。”
    公报中竭力攻击共产主义。理事会一致认为需要“加强各成员国应付和击退这种威胁的能力”。公报说，理事会对于艾森豪威尔主义“表示深为满意”
    公报在谈到军事方面时说，理事会赞成设立一个更为广泛的军事计划机构。公报说，理事会欢迎美国参加军事委员会成为正式成员，理事会“对美国的决定表示深为感佩”。
    关于所谓“反颠覆”问题，理事会“指令反颠覆委员会继续以全力采取措施”对付所谓“颠覆活动”。公报说，理事会决定于明年1月20日在安卡拉举行下一次部长级会议。巴格达条约理事会是从6月3日起举行会议的。参加会议的有伊朗、伊拉克，巴基斯坦、土耳其、英国五国的代表团以及美国的观察员代表团。在理事会开会的同时，巴格达条约军事委员会也举行了会议。
    据报纸消息，在四天会议期间，与会国之间在某些问题上存在着分歧。关于成立联合司令部的建议就由于意见不一致而没有被采纳。在所谓“反颠覆”问题上，据说，巴基斯坦和伊拉克希望除了“共产党的颠覆活动”以外，还应该对付“其他方面的颠覆活动”。而美国和英国认为，条约只应限于对付“共产党颠覆活动”。
