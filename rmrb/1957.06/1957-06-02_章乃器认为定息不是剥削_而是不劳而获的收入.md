Xinhua News Agency, May 31st Special Dispatch: At the continued session of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction's National Symposium on Guiding the Transformation of Industry and Commerce held today, Zhang Naiqi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction, delivered a speech.

He first mentioned that this symposium was very successful because everyone spoke truthfully and presented the problems, which is conducive to solving them. Then he said that the starting point of the guiding work for the transformation of industry and commerce should be: in the process of eliminating the national bourgeoisie, make every effort to find ways to improve the political consciousness of industrialists and businessmen and give play to their initiative, so as to properly eliminate the bourgeoisie, which is beneficial to socialism.

He believes that as long as one clarifies right and wrong and eliminates the "three evils," it is possible to give play to the initiative of the private sector.

He said that the transformation of industrialists and businessmen should not be formalistic. Some people think that their position is very firm, their slogans are very loud, they "label" industrialists and businessmen, and even use methods of打击吓唬 [dǎ jī xià hǔ - hitting and scaring], suppressing them, resulting in industrialists and businessmen shrinking back and not daring to work. Others do not dare to approach industrialists and businessmen, fearing that they will be tainted. This is all metaphysics and does not truly consider the interests of the working class, because in this way, there is no possibility of uniting and transforming industrialists and businessmen.

Then he talked about his views on how to give play to and improve the initiative of the private sector. He said that there are only six words: clarify right and wrong, eliminate the "three evils." Because sectarianists are unwilling to clarify right and wrong; they rely on inverting right and wrong to gain power, only talking about relatives and cronies, and only willing to listen to flattery and praise. Subjectivists cannot clarify right and wrong because they are divorced from objective reality and handle matters entirely based on subjective imagination. Bureaucrats do not dare to clarify right and wrong; although they have a sense of right and wrong in their hearts, they are afraid that speaking out will affect their position and lose their official hats. They only know how to say "yes, yes, yes" and follow orders, or be the tail of the masses. These three are mutually unified.

He said: Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism.

He believes that bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism because capitalism cannot be restored in China, but bureaucracy will revive in people's minds at any time. If socialist enterprises are coupled with bureaucracy, their efficiency will be lower than that of capitalist enterprises. I am not nostalgic for capitalism. But capitalism has both good and bad aspects, and we should absorb what is beneficial to socialism. He said, why are some socialist enterprises operating worse than the former modernized private enterprises? This is because capitalists, in order to seek profit, are good at selecting talents, and they also try to show fairness in the training and promotion of talents; otherwise, it is difficult for them to compete with others. However, some socialist enterprises cannot do this. He said that only by being clear about right and wrong and promoting and arranging people according to merit and demerit can we truly give play to the initiative of industrialists and businessmen. Only emphasizing "valuing virtue over talent and substituting seniority for virtue" will create unclear right and wrong and fail to mobilize positive factors.

He said that if public and private are separated in work, and Party members and non-Party members are separated, the work will never be done well.

He said that regarding the relationship between several parties in joint public-private enterprises, it should be clarified that the relationship of public-private cooperation is the main one, and the class relationship is residual because the class has been basically eliminated. In working relationships, there should be no distinction between the public and private sectors, or between Party members and non-Party members; matters should be handled according to responsibilities and division of labor. If public and private are separated in work, and Party members and non-Party members are separated, the work will never be done well. Only in the ideological transformation study can we remind industrialists and businessmen that there are still residual class relations, but it should not be done uniformly; it should vary from person to person. If a private sector is very progressive and has a good relationship with the public sector and employees, then the class relationship should not be emphasized. In addition, we cannot say that fixed interest all embodies class relations; we must also look at the size of the fixed interest income as a percentage of total income to determine this. We cannot use the class relationship as a kind of pressure to transform industrialists and businessmen; only through persuasion and education can we achieve the goal of transformation.

He believes that fixed interest should not be described as exploitation but as unearned income.

Then he talked about the nature of fixed interest. He said that some people think that the nature of fixed interest is exploitation, which I think is worth studying. Because, according to the literal meaning of exploitation, the exploited should be very painful, but we also say that the current contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is not antagonistic, which does not make sense. I think that fixed interest should not be described as exploitation but as unearned income, so that industrialists and businessmen can be calm and peaceful. He also said that the two thousand yuan "pole" also needs to be reconsidered and studied because this number is too small to distinguish between those above two thousand yuan are all bourgeoisie and those below two thousand yuan are all petty bourgeoisie.

He also talked about the issue of the mass line. He said that people who do not care about the suffering of the masses, even if they are with the masses every day, will not understand the situation of the masses; this is a false mass line. He told everyone that one should hate the bourgeoisie but love the bourgeois elements and unite and transform industrialists and businessmen with a spirit of benevolence and love for the masses.

He believes that the bourgeoisie and the working class have essential differences, but the members of these two classes do not have essential differences. He also said that the characteristics of all classes in our country have been basically eliminated.

Finally, he talked about the two-sidedness of industrialists and businessmen. He said that he has written a special article on this issue, which will be published soon. He believes that this issue must be viewed dialectically. After the "Five-Anti" campaign and the high tide of the entire industry's joint operation, industrialists and businessmen have handed over the means of production. If we still emphasize two-sidedness dogmatically, this will greatly affect the confidence of industrialists and businessmen in self-transformation. He said that every class has two sides, including the working class. It is only that the proportion of positive and negative aspects is different, which is a matter of being advanced or backward. He said that the bourgeoisie and the working class have essential differences, that is, one is an exploiting class, and the other is a non-exploiting and anti-exploiting class. However, it cannot be said that the members of these two classes have essential differences. The bourgeoisie's exploitation is innate, and it only ends with death; it can only be eliminated and cannot be transformed. However, bourgeois elements can be transformed because their exploitation is not innate. He believes that the characteristics of all classes in our country have been basically eliminated, and everyone is transitioning towards the common nature of mankind.

    章乃器认为定息不是剥削  而是不劳而获的收入
    本报特约新华社31日讯　在今天继续举行的中国民主建国会全国工商改造辅导工作座谈会上，中国民主建国会副主任委员章乃器讲了话。
    他首先谈到这次座谈会开得很好，因大家都说了真话，把问题摆了出来，这样就有利于解决。接着他说，工商改造辅导工作的出发点应该是：从消灭民族资产阶级过程中间，千方百计地想办法提高工商业者的政治觉悟，发挥他们的积极性，以作到妥善地消灭资产阶级，只有这样才对社会主义有利。
    他认为只要明是非、除三害，就能发挥私方的积极性。
    他说，对工商业者的改造，不能采取形式主义，有些人自认为立场很稳，口号喊得很响亮，给工商业者“扣帽子”，甚至用打击吓唬的办法，压服他们，结果，使工商业者缩手缩脚，不敢做工作。还有的不敢接近工商业者，生怕玷污了自己。这都是形而上学，没有真正从工人阶级利益考虑问题，因为这样就谈不到团结改造工商业者了。
    接着他就如何发挥和提高私方积极性谈了自己的看法。他说，这只有六个字，就是明是非，除三害。因为宗派主义者是不愿明是非的，他靠颠倒是非来弄权，只讲亲属、裙带关系，只愿听恭维、奉承。主观主义者不可能明是非，因他脱离了客观实际，完全凭主观想像处理问题。官僚主义者不敢明是非，他们心里虽有是非，但怕讲出来会影响自己的地位丢掉纱帽。他们只知唯唯诺诺，唯命是从，或者做群众的尾巴。这三者是互相统一的。
    他说：官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人。
    他认为官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人。因资本主义在中国不可能复辟，但官僚主义时时刻刻会在人们思想中复辟。如果社会主义企业加上官僚主义，那它的效率就将比资本主义企业低。我并不是留恋资本主义。但资本主义也有好有坏，我们应该吸取对社会主义有益的东西。他说，为什么有些社会主义企业经营得反而不如过去的现代化私营企业呢？这是因为资本家为了图利，善于选用人才，并且对人才的培养、提拔，还要尽量表示公平，不这样，他就很难和别人竞争。而有些社会主义企业却不能做到这点。他说，只有做到是非分明，按功、过提拔安排，才能真正发挥工商业者的积极性。光“重德轻才、以资代德”就会造成是非不明，调动不起来积极因素。
    他说如在工作上分公私，分党与非党，则工作永远做不好。
    他说，关于公私合营企业里几种关系问题，应该明确以公私共事关系为主，阶级关系是残余，因阶级已基本上消灭。在工作关系中，不应该分公方、私方，党与非党；要按职责和分工办事。如在工作上分公、私，分党与非党，则工作永远做不好，只有在思想改造的学习中，可以提醒工商业者还有阶级关系残余的存在，但也不能千篇一律，要因人而异。如果一个私方很进步，和公方、职工的关系搞得很好，就不能强调阶级关系。另外，不能说定息都体现着阶级关系，也要看定息收入占总收入大小来决定。不能把阶级关系当成一种压力，去改造工商业者，只有通过说服教育，才能达到改造的目的。
    他认为不应该把定息说成剥削，而应说是不劳而获的收入。
    接着他谈到定息的性质。他说，有些人认为定息的性质是剥削，我认为很值得研究。因为照剥削字面讲，被剥削者应该是很痛苦的，但我们又说资产阶级和工人阶级当前的矛盾，并不具有对抗性，这就说不通了。我认为不应该把定息说成剥削，而应说成是不劳而获的收入，这样，工商业者才能心平气和。他还说，二千元的杆子，也有重新考虑研究的必要，因为这个数字太小了，很难划分二千元以上的都是资产阶级；二千元以下的都是小资产阶级。
    他还谈到群众观点问题。他说，不关心群众疾苦的人，尽管每天都和群众在一起，也不会了解群众的情况，这是假的群众路线。他对大家说，对资产阶级要恨，但对资产阶级分子要爱护，要抱着与人为善，热爱群众的精神去团结改造工商业者。
    他认为：资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但这两个阶级的分子没有本质的区别。他还说，目前我国所有阶级的特性已基本消灭。
    最后，他谈到工商业者两面性的问题。他说，关于这个问题，已专门写了文章，即将发表出来。他认为，必须辩证地看待这个问题，经过“五反”和全行业合营高潮，工商业者交出了生产资料，如仍教条主义地强调两面性，这对工商业者自我改造的信心有很大影响。他说，哪个阶级都有两面性，工人阶级也有，只不过积极、消极两面的比重大小不同，这是一个先进和落后的问题。他说，资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，即一是剥削阶级，一是不剥削和反剥削的阶级。但这两个阶级的分子不能说有本质的区别。资产阶级的剥削是与生俱来，至死方休，只能消灭，不能改造；而资产阶级分子是可以改造的，因他的剥削不是与生俱来的。他认为目前我国所有阶级的特性已基本上消灭，大家正在向人类的共同本性过渡。
