Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: Soviet pilots are preparing to fly jet aircraft on the third flight in Soviet aviation history over the Arctic to America, carrying the sincere greetings of the Soviet people for a friendly visit to the United States.

This was recently said to a reporter from the Soviet magazine "Spark" by Baidukov, a participant in the world's first non-stop flight over the North Pole to the United States and now a Lieutenant General of the Soviet Air Force.

Baidukov said that on June 20, 1937, Soviet pilots completed the world's first flight over the Arctic to the United States. Those who participated in that flight were Chkalov, Belyakov, and myself. We flew for a total of sixty-three hours and sixteen minutes. Soviet pilots Gromov, Yumashev, and Danilin subsequently made a second flight on July 14 of the same year. In this flight, they set a world record for range: flying 10,148 kilometers in a straight line in sixty-two hours and seventeen minutes.

Baidukov said that then, as now, most Americans did not know much about the Soviet Union, or had great misunderstandings about it. Despite this, the common American people guessed in their hearts that the Soviet people wanted to be friends with the American people. It is regrettable that there are people in the United States who hope to turn the route to America via the Arctic opened up by Soviet pilots into a road of war. But they should remember that we have not forgotten the ability to fly over the Arctic Ocean.

　　飞越北极去美国  不辞劳苦送友谊
    苏联壮士将作豪举
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联飞行员准备乘喷气式飞机，作苏联航空史上第三次越过北极去美国的飞行，带着苏联人民的真诚问候去美国作友好访问。
    这是世界上第一次越北极去美国的不着陆飞行的参加者、现在的苏联空军中将巴伊杜科夫最近对苏联“星火”杂志记者说的。
    巴伊杜科夫说，苏联飞行员在1937年6月20日曾经完成了世界上第一次越过北极去美国的飞行。参加那次飞行的有契卡洛夫、别利亚科夫和我。我们共飞行了六十三小时零十六分。苏联飞行员格罗莫夫、尤马谢夫和达尼林随后在同年7月14日又作了第二次飞行。他们在这次飞行中创造了航程的世界纪录：在六十二小时零十七分钟内直线飞行了一万零一百四十八公里。
    巴伊杜科夫说，那时和现在一样，大多数美国人都不大知道苏联的情况，或是对苏联有很大的误解。尽管这样，普通美国人民的心里都猜想到，苏联人民是想同美国人友好的。遗憾的是，在美国有这样的人，他们希望把苏联飞行员打通的经北极去美国的航线变为战争之路。但是，他们应当记住，我们并没有把学会飞过北冰洋去的本领忘掉。
