　　France Also Breaks Through Embargo Circle
　　West German Public Opinion Supports Government's "Bold" Step

　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from Paris: The French government decided on the 19th to relax trade restrictions with China. According to this decision, the list of products that France will export to China in the future will be the same as those exported to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries. The French government has already notified the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Export Controls to Communist Areas of this decision and will notify French exporters of this change in the "Government Gazette" on the 20th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th: Many West German newspapers published the news of the West German government's decision to relax the embargo on China in prominent positions on the 19th. The Hamburg "Die Welt" also published an editorial entitled "Stepping Out of the Circle." This editorial said that the West German move to relax the embargo on China was a "bold" step for the Americans who insist on a strict embargo.
　　The newspaper also wrote, "The embargo is an obstacle to the path of universal understanding, and one day the Americans will also be forced to relax it. It is very pleasant that we are now stepping out of this circle. This step is also a good prelude to the negotiations between (West) German industrial representatives in Beijing in mid-October this year."

　　法国也冲破禁运圈子
    西德舆论支持政府“大胆的”步骤
    新华社20日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府19日决定放宽对中国的贸易限制。根据这项决定，法国将来向中国输出的产品货单将同向苏联和东欧社会主义国家输出的相同。法国政府已经把这个决定通知巴黎对华贸易管制国际委员会，并且将于20日在“政府公报”中把这一改变通知法国出口商。
    新华社柏林20日电　西德许多报纸19日以显著地位刊载了西德政府决定放宽对华禁运的消息。汉堡“世界报”并且发表了题为“跳出了圈子”的社论。这篇社论说，西德采取的放宽对华禁运的措施对坚持严格禁运的美国人来说，是一个“大胆的”步骤。
    这家报纸还写道，“禁运是普遍谅解道路上的障碍，有一天美国人也会被迫放松的。我们现在跳出了这个圈子，这是很令人愉快的。这一步骤也是今年10月中旬（西）德国工业界代表在北京进行谈判的良好前奏曲。”
