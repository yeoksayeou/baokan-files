Abundant Production Areas Must Have a Global Perspective
Hubei Province Should Seize the Summer Grain Unified Purchase Work
Yi Xingzhi, Li Jintang
In this year's summer grain unified purchase work, Hubei Province has seen several prominent problems: inaccurate output figures, overly generous grain retention, and unreasonable distribution. This situation inevitably leads to collectives that originally have surplus grain selling less of it, self-sufficient collectives becoming grain-deficient, and grain-deficient collectives becoming even more deficient. The result is that the state purchases less and sells more.

This year, the actual summer grain harvest in Hubei Province is generally greater than the estimated production, but the state's unified purchase target has not increased. So why are the above phenomena occurring? Our understanding is that, apart from the fact that some areas suffered reduced production last year due to drought relief and rush planting, the main reason is that the policy has not been implemented thoroughly. Specifically, after the wheat harvest, some cadres developed a sense of complacency and optimism, thinking that "with good harvests in both autumn and spring, there are no grain problems; with the 'Three Fixes' as the basis, there are no worries; with experience, there are no deviations. The so-called summer grain unified purchase is just a matter of a few calculations, a few retentions, and a few distributions." As a result, they did not meticulously publicize and implement the unified purchase policy, did not investigate or calculate accounts, and simply accepted the figures reported by the collectives. Secondly, some cadres of agricultural cooperatives have a one-sided understanding of the policy of "retention by the collective, sale by the collective." They report production at 80% of the actual amount and expand the grain retention standard. For example, the Heping Cooperative in Tianxing Township, Gong'an County, retained 40 to 60 catties of ration grain (rice) per person per month during the summer-autumn transition period; the Jinta Cooperative in Heping Township, Dangyang County, retained grain from last year until the autumn harvest this year, and did not experience any shortage during the summer-autumn transition, but the cooperative retained 42,000 catties of wheat as "tasting the new grain." In terms of feed grain retention, they also "err on the side of more rather than less." The Baiping Cooperative in Nanqiao Township, Jingmen County, retained 600 to 800 catties of grain per year for each sow and donkey; and up to 2,160 catties per mule and horse. Thirdly, agricultural cooperatives, for the sake of convenience, want to retain more reserve grain, while members want to receive more grain and less cash. Households with more work point income emphasize that more labor should be reflected in the grain distribution, resulting in significant disparities in grain surplus and shortage among members.

These phenomena tell us that grain unified purchase is an arduous and complex task that cannot be relaxed under any circumstances. It is particularly important to strengthen leadership in abundant production areas. Therefore, it is very important to educate cadres and the masses to be forward-looking in grain unified purchase work. It is essential to make the people understand that although this region has had a good harvest this year, other regions are still experiencing disasters, and it is the unshirkable duty of abundant production areas to complete the unified purchase task and support disaster areas. Closer to home, although there is a good harvest this summer, the autumn grain harvest is still uncertain. If there is a poor harvest, will state supplies be needed? Therefore, abundant production areas must purchase the grain that should be purchased. Purchase more in the summer if possible, and purchase less if that is sufficient. Only on the basis of completing the unified purchase task can the state guarantee the supply of grain to people in urban and rural areas who are short of grain. Of course, for those areas where production has been reduced due to disasters and the task allocation is unreasonable, timely adjustments should be made to avoid purchasing excessive grain and then having to supply it back.

It should be said that the average of 1.4 to 1.5 catties of wheat per person per day retained in the Hubei region during the summer-autumn transition period is sufficient, as it has reached or exceeded the actual consumption level in previous years. Therefore, grain retention should not blindly expand the standard. It is appropriate to relax grain retention slightly during the current busy farming season, but this relaxation should be maintained at a level that balances the annual grain retention and does not affect the completion of the task. Deviating from this principle will not only encourage grain waste, but more importantly, bring great passivity to the autumn unified purchase work. In Jiangyao Township, Xiaogan County, on the basis of implementing the policy and mobilizing the masses to self-report, the average self-reported grain retention per person during the summer-autumn transition period was 81 catties, which is not only less than the standard of 100 catties estimated by the cadres behind closed doors, but also satisfies the masses.

Abundant production areas should also pay special attention to saving grain. For example, livestock feed must pay attention to substitute feed. In the situation where the national grain is not yet abundant, it is inappropriate to rely solely on grain feed to raise livestock without picking, planting, and silage feed. It is necessary to retain a little more grain for seed due to close planting and multiple cropping, but not too much. Some agricultural cooperatives wasted seeds last year.

　　丰产地区要有全局观点
    湖北省应该抓紧夏粮统购工作
　　易行之　李金堂
    湖北省今年在夏粮统购工作中，出现了几个突出的问题：产量不实、留粮偏宽和分配不尽合理。这种情况必然使本来有余粮的社能卖的余粮少卖了，自足自给的社变成缺粮了，缺粮的社缺得更多了，结果是形成国家少购多销。
    湖北省今年夏粮收获量一般是实产大于估产，而国家统购任务并未增加。那么为什么会出现上述的现象？我们的认识是，除了部分地区去年抗旱抢种，因灾减产以外，主要是政策没有贯彻下去。具体的说，主要是在小麦丰收以后，某些干部产生了麻痹乐观情绪，以为“去秋今春两季丰收，粮食无问题；有‘三定’作依据无顾虑；有经验无偏差。所谓夏粮统购，只不过是几算、几留、几分的问题罢了。”因而不细致地宣传贯彻统购政策，不摸底、不算帐，让社里报个数字就算完事。其次是有些农业社的干部，片面理解“由社留，由社卖”的政策，他们报产量打八折，扩大留粮标准。如公安县天兴乡和平社，夏接秋期间每人每月留口粮（大米）四十至六十斤；当阳县和平乡金塔社，去年留粮留到今年接秋，夏接秋期间并不缺，但社里却留了四万二千斤小麦作“尝新”粮。在饲料留粮上，也“宁多勿少”，荆门县南桥乡白坪社，公母猪和驴子每头全年留粮六至八百斤；骡马每头留到二千一百六十斤。再次是农业社为了工作方便，都想多留点机动粮，而社员却想多进点粮食，少进点钱，工分收入多的户，强调在粮食分配上体现多劳多得，其结果使社员之间粮食余缺悬殊。
    这些现象告诉我们，粮食统购是个艰巨复杂的工作，任何情况下都不能放松，特别值得注意的是越是丰产地区越要加强领导。因此，教育干部和群众在粮食统购工作上瞻前顾后十分重要，一定要使人民群众认识到今年此地丰收，但彼地还有灾情，而丰产区完成统购任务、支援灾区是义不容辞的。近一点说，今年夏季虽然丰收，秋季粮食还未卜丰歉，如果一旦发生歉收，是否也需要国家供应呢？所以丰收地区一定要把该收购的粮食收购起来，夏季能多购的就多购，能少购的就少购，只有在完成统购任务的基础上，国家才能保证城乡缺粮人民的供应。当然对那些因灾减产，任务分配不合理的地区，也要及时调整，以免购买了过头粮再去供应。
    应当说，湖北地区今年夏接秋期间的留粮，每人每天平均一斤四两到一斤半小麦是够用的，它已经达到或超过了历年实际的消费水平。因此，留粮不宜盲目扩大标准。目前正是农忙季节，留粮适当放宽一点是适当的，但这种宽的尺度应当保持在全年留粮平衡，不影响完成任务的水平上，离开这个原则，不仅会滋长粮食浪费，而更重要的是，给秋季统购工作带来了很大的被动。孝感县姜姚乡在通过贯彻政策，发动群众自报的基础上，在夏接秋期间每人自报留粮平均为八十一斤，这不但比原来干部关门估计的一百斤的标准减少了，而且群众也满意。
    丰收地区还应当特别注意节约粮食。如牲畜饲料必须注意代用饲料，在全国粮食还不富裕的情况下，不采摘、种植、青贮饲料，单靠粮食饲料养牲畜是不应当的。种籽用粮，由于密植复种多留一点是必要的，但不能留得过多，去年有些农业社就浪费了种籽。
