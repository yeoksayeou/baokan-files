　　Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, June 22nd: The Canadian Progressive Conservative Party, which won the election on June 10th, formed a new government on the 21st.

　　Progressive Conservative leader John Diefenbaker has become Prime Minister. Major General G. R. Pearkes is the Minister of National Defence, Donald Fleming is the Minister of Finance, and Gordon Churchill is the Minister of Trade and Commerce. Diefenbaker did not nominate a Minister of Foreign Affairs, and it is said that he will temporarily hold this position concurrently.

　　Diefenbaker said after being sworn in that Canada's foreign policy would not undergo major changes after his new government took office. As the opposition party, the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberal Party have always had "a large degree of consensus" on foreign policy. He also said that he did not see any changes in Canada's attitude towards the United States or the Commonwealth in the future. At the same time, he said that he is currently unwilling to make a policy statement on this issue.

    总理迪芬贝克说外交政策不会有重大改变
    新华社22日讯　渥太华消息：在6月10日选举中获胜的加拿大进步保守党21日组成新政府。
    进步保守党的领袖迪芬贝克出任内阁总理。格·鲁·皮尔克斯少将为国防部长、唐纳尔·弗莱明为财政部长、戈登·丘吉尔为贸易与商业部长。迪芬贝克没有提名外交部长，据说他将暂时兼任这个职务。
    迪芬贝克在宣誓就职后说，在他的新政府执政以后，加拿大的外交政策将不会有重大的改变。在作为反对党的时候，进步保守党和自由党之间对外交政策一直存在着“很大程度的一致”。他还说，他看不出今后加拿大对美国或者英联邦的态度会有所改变。同时他又说，他目前不愿意对这个问题发表政策声明。
