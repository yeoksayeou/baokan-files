    Some organizations make summaries every year, and every time there is a point: to strengthen ideological work. One strengthening, two strengthenings, some have already strengthened to such an extent: the Party and Youth League branches have an unshirkable responsibility; the trade union has an undeniable duty; below the administrative head, the directors of departments, offices, and divisions naturally manage; the personnel section goes without saying, and even the heads and deputy heads of business sections and groups take this as their main task; all Party members, Youth League members, etc. who are not in leadership positions also invariably do this work.

    Those who do ideological work are truly numerous. But the effect often illustrates: is it many, or not many?

    In my opinion, ideological work cannot be abolished; but the approach needs to be changed. There should be specialized departments and people responsible, and it is best to focus on quality rather than quantity; in addition to this, rather than vying to call oneself an ideological worker, it is better to take off this sign, practice what you preach, and demonstrate excellent thinking through your work.

    有些机关，年年做总结，回回有一条：要加强思想工作。一加强，二加强，有的已经加强到了这样的程度：党、团支部，义不容辞；工会，责无旁贷；行政首长以下，部啊室啊处啊的主任，当然也管；人事科不必说，业务科组的正副组长，居然也有以此为主的；所有不在领导岗位的党员团员等，也无往而不做这一门工作。
    做思想工作的，真是多极了。效果却往往说明：多乎哉，不多也。
    我看，思想工作是取消不得的；但做法需要改一改。要专责的部门和人，人最好重质不重量；除此以外，与其纷纷以思想工作者自居，不如摘下这块牌子，身体力行，从工作中表现出优良的思想来。
