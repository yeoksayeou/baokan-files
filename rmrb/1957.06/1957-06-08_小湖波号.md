　　The water level was more than a meter above the levee, and coupled with several days of strong winds and waves, the lake levee and the emergency sub-levees that had been built were also leveled. West Dongting Lake became a boundless ocean.

　　The Xiaohubo (Little Lake Wave) had not stopped its rescue missions since the floodwaters rose. Last night, it received instructions from the Hanshou County Party Committee to quickly rescue the farmers in the large house of the Taibai Lake Township government. The Xiaohubo loaded up with coal and set off immediately at midnight that day.

　　Not long after the ship sailed, the temperature suddenly dropped, and the northern horizon appeared very gloomy. “Da Che” (Big Cart) - a sailor with more than twenty years of sailing experience, turned his head from his seat and greeted everyone: “There’s a wind coming.”

　　Shi Youxiang (the union group leader - the person in charge of this rescue mission) raised his voice: “Everyone pay attention, a wind is coming, prepare quickly!”

　　The howling and roaring north wind intensified in bursts, quickly changing from force six or seven to force eight. Waves rolled in from the boundless north like overturned mountains and seas, throwing up columns of water on the surface. They stretched their heads forward and lunged, as if trying to swallow something, before rushing forward to the next wave. Chasms appeared between the two waves. They lifted the Xiaohubo high up and then threw it down again. Treacherous crosswinds hit the ship with a loud crashing sound, tearing the cloth covers on both sides of the ship and hitting inside.

　　The boat rocked violently. Shi Youxiang spread his legs wide and swayed from the bow to the stern, and from the stern to the bow. He looked at the engine room. The stoker was sweating profusely, shoveling new coal into the furnace one shovel at a time, and digging out cinders from the bottom of the furnace one shovel at a time. The fire was burning very brightly. He listened to the engine, which was also running normally, but the rhythm was becoming increasingly rapid. He also went to the driver's platform. He saw that "Da Che" was watching the waves intently, calmly holding the helm, but he was still worried about the machine breaking down and delaying important matters.

　　The whistle frequently emitted long blasts. Everyone understood "Da Che's" intention, he wanted the sound of the whistle to awaken people's confidence in life, to let people know that someone was coming to save them.

　　"Look! There's someone on the roof." The red-faced little devil shouted.

　　"We're here, that's the township government."

　　"The township government's big house hasn't collapsed!" People cheered. The whistle also wailed constantly.

　　The township government's large house was being attacked by the waves, and the boat could not get close, so it had to stop next to a few old poplar trees sixty or seventy meters away from the large house.

　　Sailor Lai A'gen took a floating brick from the cabin in one stride and tied it to his body. Before Shi Youxiang could speak, he jumped onto the small boat. Shi Youxiang hurriedly shouted: "Wait, let me arrange it, Lao Lai, you steer one, I'll steer one, and two more helpers will come." The sailors scrambled to get on the small boat. The red-faced little devil who was in charge of serving tea pushed everyone away and said to Shi Youxiang: "I'm good at dealing with wind and waves, I'll go." Shi Youxiang agreed to let the little devil go with him. Two small boats rushed towards the big house.

　　The situation in the big house was extremely urgent. The house was originally built sturdily, but it had been around for a long time, and with the waves surging in and out, the situation became critical. As they approached the big house, the little devil heard the roof beams creaking. He shouted to Shi Youxiang: "It's going to collapse." "Keep calm, it's okay." Shi Youxiang winked at the little devil.

　　The small boat docked at the west end of the house. Shi Youxiang flipped over and jumped onto the floor.

　　The dark mass of heads upstairs suddenly stirred. Calls for help, cries, and the wails of babies made a chaotic noise. Some people even stood up from their original seats and rushed towards Shi Youxiang. Seeing that order was about to break down, Shi Youxiang shouted: "Don't move!" Then he said: "The house is dangerous, we are here specifically to pick you up, we won't abandon anyone."

　　He scanned the room. The roof was full of about a hundred people. Near the western end of the floor, families huddled together. Near the eastern end, there was only a crossbeam and no floor. People sat on the crossbeam using wooden planks and benches, some holding onto the rafters with their hands and their feet dangling in the water.

　　Old Tong, who was sent by the county, also climbed in. As soon as he entered the house, he asked everyone: "Is Secretary Chen here?"

　　Secretary Chen quickly replied: "Here I am." Secretary Chen was designated by the Party to stay and take care of the masses.

　　"Lao Shi, two boats are not enough, Lao Chen, how many boats do you have?" Lao Tong asked.

　　"We have eight more boats."

　　"Organize them quickly."

　　Secretary Chen selected boatmen from the crowd. People had been frightened for days, and some had not eaten for a day or two. After searching for a long time, they only found six farmers who could row boats.

　　"I'll row one." Lao Tong said.

　　"Lao Tong, our Er Che is an expert, please ask him to row one too." Shi Youxiang said.

　　The red-faced little devil was arranged to help the old and young onto the boat.

　　Widow Cui held a child in her left hand, a clothing package under her right arm, and also carried a small box. As she approached the opening, the little devil first took the child from her and gave it to the people on the small boat, and then helped Widow Cui onto the boat. But as soon as Widow Cui stood firm, the small boat rocked, and she leaned back and rolled into the lake.

　　People shouted together.

　　The little devil immediately untied the floating brick from his body, took a deep breath, and pushed off with both feet, jumping into the lake. The little devil spread his hands and groped around in the lake. A wave rolled Widow Cui out of the water from the bottom of the lake, and another wave rolled the little devil out as well. The little devil saw the direction, approached her with a dive, and then put his arms around Widow Cui's shoulders from behind, and used his strength to lift her up. Lift, lift, lift her out of the water.

　　Widow Cui got on the small boat and wailed, crying as she said: "Comrade, you saved my life. What's your name?"

　　The little devil didn't say anything.

　　"Comrade, I, Niu Ya'zi, will recognize you as my savior, recognize you as my savior."

　　At this moment, the seventeen or eighteen-year-old little devil felt very shy and lowered his head bashfully.

　　Ten small boats rowed laboriously in the lake. Some of the boatmen selected from the farmers were exhausted after one or two trips. The waves were big and the boats were small, and each trip only carried four or five people. It was getting dark again, and the ten small boats gradually decreased to eight, and finally only six remained. Shi Youxiang was anxious, he used all his strength and rowed back and forth desperately. Lai A'gen also rowed silently and desperately.

　　It was not until night completely enveloped the lake that Secretary Chen and the others finally left the big house.

　　Shi Youxiang climbed onto the steamboat with great joy. His face was pale, his whole body was covered in goosebumps, and he saw stars before his eyes. Without resting, he hurried to the kitchen and shouted to his comrades: "Comrades, make food quickly, they are extremely hungry."

    小湖波号
    罗祥生
    水位超过堤高一公尺以上了，加上连续了几天的大风浪，把湖堤和抢险赶筑起来的子埝也扫平了。西洞庭湖成了一望无际的海洋。
    湖波号自从涨水以来就没有停息过抢险任务。昨晚又接到汉寿县委的指示，要它把太白湖乡政府大屋里的农民火速抢救出来。小湖波号上足了煤，当天午夜立即出发。
    行船不久，气温突然下降，靠北边天际显得十分阴沉。“大车”——一位有二十多年航海经验的水手，在座位上扭过头来向大伙打招呼：“有风来。”
    史有祥（工会小组长——这次抢救任务的负责人）放开了嗓门：“大伙注意，有风来，快准备！”。
    狂呼怒吼的北风，阵阵加大，很快由六级七级转为八级。浪头从无际的北方排山倒海的滚来，水面抛起一道道的水柱，伸起头来向前一扑，似乎要吞灭什么似的又赶向前一个浪头去了，两个浪潮之间出现了一道道的深渊。它们把小湖波号一下高举起来，一下又给甩了下去。凶险的横浪，把浪头打到船身上，发出碰擦碰擦的巨响，浪头撕破了船身两旁的布围，打进了船里。
    船簸得很厉害，史有祥跨开八字脚，摇摇摆摆的从船头跑到船尾，从船尾跑到船头。他看了看机舱。司炉满头大汗正一铲一铲的向炉子送进新煤，一铲一铲的从炉底挖出煤渣，火烧得挺旺的。他听了听机器，机器也转得正常，只是节奏越来越急促了。他又到司机台。只见那“大车”目不转睛的看着浪势，安详的把握着舵柄，但他还是担心机器出故障，误了大事。
    汽笛频繁的发出一声声的长鸣。大伙都懂得“大车”的用意，他要让汽笛的呼声去唤起人们生命的信心，让人们知道有人来救他们了。
    “看！那屋顶上有个人。”红脸庞小鬼叫了起来。
    “到了，那就是乡政府。”
    “乡政府大屋没有倒！”人们欢呼起来。汽笛也呜呜不断的欢鸣。
    乡政府大屋被大浪袭击着，船不能靠近，只好在离大屋六、七十公尺远的几棵老杨树旁停了下来。
    水手赖阿根一个箭步从舱里取了浮砖捆在身上，还没等史有祥开腔就跳上了小船。史有祥急忙喊道：“慢着，让我调派一下，老赖，你驾一个，我驾一个，还来两个帮手。”水手们争着要上小船。管茶水的红脸庞小鬼推开了大伙，向着史有祥说道：“风浪里我的本事大，我去。”史有祥同意小鬼跟他去了。两只小船冲向大屋。
    大屋的情况万分紧急。房子本来修得还结实，但是年代已经很久，加以风浪涌进涌出，情况就危急起来。快靠近大屋，小鬼就听到屋梁吱吱发响，他向史有祥喊了一句：“会垮。”“沉住气，不要紧。”史有祥向小鬼使了个眼色。
    小船在屋子西头靠住。史有祥一个翻身跳到了楼板上。
    楼上黑压压的人头顿时浮动起来。呼救声，哭泣声，婴儿号叫声闹成一片。有的人还从原来位子站了起来赶向史有祥。看着秩序要混乱了。史有祥大喝一声：“不要动！”接着说：“房子危险了，我们专来接你们，一个也不会放弃。”
    他向屋里扫视了一周。屋顶足足坐了百来个人。靠西头楼板上，一家家老小围成一团。靠东头只有横梁没有楼板，人们就用木板长凳搭在横梁上坐着，有的手拉住椽皮，脚掉在水里。
    县里派来的老童也翻进来，他一进屋就向大伙问：“陈支书在吗？”
    陈支书连忙应道：“在这里。”陈支书是党指定留下来招呼群众的。
    “老史，两只船不够，老陈，你们自己有多少船？”老童问。
    “我们还有八只船。”
    “赶快组织起来。”
    陈支书在人群里挑选着划船的汉子，人们几天来受了虚惊，有的人一两天没有吃饭，找来找去才找到六个农民出来划船。
    “我划一个。”老童说。
    “老童，咱们二车是里手，请他也划一个。”史有祥说。
    红脸庞小鬼被安排搀扶老幼上船。
    翠寡妈左手抱了小孩，右腋挟衣包，还提小箱子。她走近了楼口，小鬼先从她手里把小孩抱给小船上的人，然后扶着翠寡妈上了船。但是翠寡妈刚站定，小船一簸，她向后一仰，滚到湖里去了。
    人们一齐喊叫起来。
    小鬼一下解下了身上的浮砖，吸了口大气，双脚朝穿方一蹬，腾空一跃也插到了湖里。小鬼撒开了双手在湖里摸来摸去。一个浪头把翠寡妈从湖底卷出了水面，另一个浪头把小鬼也卷了出来。小鬼看清了方向，一个氽攻靠近了她，然后用双手从后面搂住了翠寡妈的肩膀，使劲的把她举了起来。举、举、举出了水面。
    翠寡妈上了小船，号啕大哭，她边哭边说：“同志，你救了我的命。你叫什么？”
    小鬼没有作声。
    “同志，我牛伢子寄拜你，寄拜你。”
    这一下，这个十七、八岁的小鬼感到十分害臊，羞答答的低下了头。
    十只小船艰难的在湖里划着。农民中挑选出来的划船手有的跑一趟有的跑两趟就精疲力竭了。浪大船小，跑一趟才装了四、五个人。天色又看着黑了，十只小船渐渐的减为八只，最后只剩了六只。史有祥心里火急，他使上了全身力气，来回拼命的划着。赖阿根也无声无息的拼命的划。
    直到夜幕完全笼罩了湖面，陈支书他们才最后离开了大屋。
    史有祥满心喜欢的爬上了汽船。他面色苍白，满身都起了鸡皮，眼前直冒金花。他没有休息，连忙走到厨房，对伙伴们叫喊“同志们，快做饭，他们饿极了。”
