What People Are Saying

　　"Purges are much ado about nothing"
　　Abstract of articles by Zhang Baisheng and Huang Zhenlü of Shenyang Normal College
    It is very clear that the Party Central Committee's assessment of the remaining enemies is the biggest form of subjectivism. Under the guidance of this subjectivist thinking, it is inevitable that there will be a tendency to be "rather left than right," wrongly attacking good people and undermining the rule of law... Truly, it is "much ado about nothing"!
    Both the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the purges attempt to use violence to maintain the fruits of the revolution, which runs counter to China's famous traditional ideas of "loving the people like children," "governing the country with virtue," and "governing the country by law."
    "If the main beam is not straight, the secondary beams will be crooked." The main root of the "three evils" lies in the central government. If the root of the "three evils" is not removed, the "three evils" will be like weeds: "Wildfires cannot burn them out, the spring breeze blows and they rise again." In order to get rid of them once and for all, we must trace their roots and dig out the root of the "three evils" completely.
    After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party gradually became the superior of the people, gradually turning "worrying about the world's troubles before others, and enjoying the world's happiness after others" into an empty slogan, becoming privileged, indulging in the mud of being founding fathers, having made great contributions, and deserving power and influence, indulging in the self-appreciation of being made of special materials, always thinking that they are the most excellent, indispensable. Hypocritically publicizing its own greatness, glory, and correctness, putting itself above the state and the people, with the air of "the party is the state, the state is the party." Because the party has the final say on all issues, and does not trust non-party members organizationally, it rejects all contrary advice from outside the party, which makes the party begin to become detached from the masses from the ideological and organizational level.
    In the years since liberation, there has been no real socialist democracy, only formality. Not only is there no real socialist democracy, but there is not even the false democracy of capitalist countries. The constitution has become a mere scrap of paper, and the party can disregard it. On the surface, there are democratic elections, united front policies, and non-party members doing leadership work, but in reality, it is a one-party dictatorship, a dictatorship of a few people in the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee. There is no democracy within the party either. Lower-level party organizations and members can only implement the instructions and resolutions of the Party Central Committee. Criticism of the work of the Party Central Committee is just empty talk because there are no conditions to do so. Non-party members doing leadership work have positions but no power, only the obligation to implement resolutions, and no actual possibility of participating in decision-making. The party is the emperor emeritus, awe-inspiring and sacred. Holding the Bible of Marxism-Leninism in one hand and wielding the sword of state power in the other, anyone who dares to raise objections is either labeled with the iron hat of anti-Marxism-Leninism or handcuffed with "trumped-up" charges. Elections are just disguised appointments. Representatives only represent individuals, and no one knows what kind of person they are electing or what they said on their behalf. As for gatherings, associations, publications, etc., they must all be carried out under the leadership of the party and cannot overstep the mark. How can this reflect that the people are the masters of the country? This is a violation of human rights, a serious undermining of the rule of law, and must be changed.
    Who has the final say on state affairs? The constitution stipulates that it is the "NPC" (National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, for short) that has the final say, but in reality, the "NPC" is just a clay idol, and all the power is in the hands of the Party Central Committee. The "NPC" is just going through the motions, raising hands to pass laws, completing legislative procedures. In recent years, it has rarely been seen that the "NPC" has conducted genuine discussions on state affairs, and it has rarely been seen that members have put forward major motions, but occasionally, some of their insignificant inspection notes are published in the newspapers. Isn't this a joke! Even more ridiculous is the "CPPCC," which claims to be a united front, but puts its main energy into organizing work on issues such as study, which is actually not asking about politics, or asking but not governing, governing but not coordinating. The "NPC" and the "CPPCC" are like two paper flowers decorating the facade of democracy. Of course, the fault does not lie with the "NPC" and the "CPPCC," but with the Party Central Committee. The party has become an emperor emeritus above the government and above the constitution for the "NPC" and the "CPPCC." It is not just replacing the government with the party, but also replacing the constitution with the party, replacing the "NPC" with the party... It is inconceivable that mistakes would not occur with such arbitrary orders from a small number of people. And the Party Central Committee has not conducted any public self-criticism since the founding of the country.

### “肃反是庸人自扰”

　　“肃反是庸人自扰”
　　沈阳师范学院张百生、黄振旅的文章摘要
    很明显，党中央对残余敌人的估计是最大的主观主义，在这种主观主义的思想指导下，就不可避免地要出现“宁左勿右”，打错了好人，破坏了法制……。真是“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”！
    镇反和肃反都是企图用暴力维护革命果实，这与我国著名的“爱民如子”“以德立国”“以法治国”的传统思想是背道而驰的。
    “大梁不正，二梁歪”，“三害”的主要根源在中央。如果不把“三害”的根子除掉，“三害”就会像野草一样：“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。为了一劳永逸，必须穷其根源，把“三害”的根子彻底挖出。
    中国共产党在解放后逐渐在成为人民的上司，逐渐把“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”变成了空洞的口号，自己变成了特权者，陶醉于自己是开国元勋，有汗马功劳，应当有权有势的泥潭中，陶醉于自己是特殊材料制成的自我欣赏里，总以为自己是最优秀的，非我不可。自吹自擂地宣传自己伟大、光荣、正确，把自己摆在国家之上、人民之上，大有“党即国家，国家即党”的气派。由于党对一切问题有最后决定权，从组织上又不信任非党人士，就会把党外的一切逆耳的忠言拒于千里之外，这就使党从思想上到组织上开始脱离群众。
    解放后这几年来是没有真正的社会主义民主的，有也只是形式，不仅没有真正的社会主义的民主，连资本主义国家的假民主也没有，宪法成了一纸空文，党可以不遵守它。表面上有民主选举，有统战政策，有党外人士做领导工作，实际上是党一党专政，是党中央政治局少数人独裁。党内也没有民主，下级党组织和党员只能贯彻党中央的指示、决议，可以批评党中央工作，由于没有条件也就成了空谈。党外人士做领导工作是有职无权，只有执行决议的义务，没有参与决策的实际可能。党是太上皇，是威武神圣的。一手托着马列主义的圣经，一手仗着国家政权的宝剑，谁敢提出异议，不是被扣上反马列主义的铁帽，就是被带上“莫须有”罪名的手铐。选举只是变相的任命，代表只代表个人，谁也不知道自己选的人是怎样的，他代表自己说了些什么。至于集会、结社、出版等，都必须在党的领导下进行，不能逾越雷池一步，这怎能体现人民是国家的主人？这是对人权的侵犯，严重的破坏法制，必须改变。
    国家大事谁说了算？在宪法上规定是“人大”（人民代表大会及其常委会之简称。下同）说了算，而在实际上“人大”不过是个泥菩萨而已，全权都操在党中央手里。“人大”只是走走形式，举手通过，完成立法手续。几年来很少看见“人大”对国家大事进行过真正的讨论，很少看见委员提出重大动议，却偶尔看见他们的一些无关痛痒的考察记在报上发表。这岂不是笑话！更可笑的是号称统一战线的“政协”，把主要精力放在组织有关学习等问题的工作上，实际是不问政治，或者说问而不政，政而不治，治而不协。“人大”与“政协”就像两朵纸花一样点缀着民主的门面。当然，错不在“人大”和“政协”，责在党中央。党对“人大”与“政协”说来，成了超政府、超宪法的太上皇。不只是以党代政，而且是以党代宪法，以党代“人大”……。这样少数人的专断，肆无忌惮地发号施令，不发生错误倒是不可思议的了。而党中央从建国以来就没有进行过公开的自我批评。
