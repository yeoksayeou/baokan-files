　　Recording for Reference
　　——Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper
　　Yao Wenyuan

　　The value of the same news item can differ by a hundred thousand miles depending on how different editors arrange it. This wonderful secret I recently learned from the newspaper.

　　A few days ago, Chairman Mao gave a speech when he received representatives of the Communist Youth League. Although the speech was short, its meaning was extremely profound. *Jiefang Daily* used extra-large type and eye-catching headlines to place it as the top news item. *People's Daily* placed it in the middle, with a headline smaller than that of *Jiefang Daily*, but it also highlighted, "Unite and bravely and resolutely struggle for the great cause of socialism; all words and actions that depart from socialism are wrong." But *Wenhui Daily* shrunk it down to the point where it was almost impossible for careless people to find, or even if they saw it, they would think it was an insignificant piece of news. Its entire prominence was about the size of two characters of the headline used by *Jiefang Daily*.

　　What exactly caused the editorial departments of the three newspapers to have such different valuations of a news item? Was it because *Jiefang Daily* thought this news was particularly important, or was it because the editors of *Wenhui Daily* felt that this talk about socialism, the leadership of the Party... was something they had already "heard to death," and there was nothing new, so it was insignificant? Or was it because the editors thought that the readers of *Wenhui Daily* were intellectuals and had nothing to do with young people? Or did the editors think that highlighting this news would affect "contention," because it seems unsuitable to say much about the leadership of the Party and socialism in "contention"? Because I said a few words, I was strongly opposed by some people...

　　I don't want to judge right and wrong. Perhaps everyone has their own reasons. "That is one right and wrong, this is another right and wrong,"—because different newspaper editing methods are also a type of "contention." Chairman Mao once said that running newspapers in this way and that way is just two different approaches. I don't want to analyze the merits and demerits, because now everyone is still taking care of their own methods. For example, regarding Li Weihan's speech, *People's Daily* highlighted "Socialism is the political basis for long-term coexistence" as the headline and used "...Generally speaking, many of the criticisms and opinions put forward from all sides are correct and should be seriously accepted and handled; a considerable part are wrong and need to be further studied and analyzed" as the sub-headline. *Wenhui Daily*, on the other hand, used "The CCP sincerely welcomes supervision and help" as the headline, and "Believes that many criticisms and opinions are helpful to overcome the three major styles and further strengthen and consolidate the core leadership of the Communist Party" as the sub-headline. Anyone with discerning eyes can see that their focuses are different. But I think this difference is a much better phenomenon than "uniformity." I don't want to investigate the different psychological states behind everyone's different focuses, because I don't have the talent to "predict the future." Therefore, regarding right and wrong, merits and demerits, and reasons, they all need further investigation.

　　Some people may ask: Don't you have your own opinions? Answer: Yes, I do. But I don't want to say them. And why don't I want to say them? Answer: I also don't want to say. This is not like what Comrade Tang Tao said, "wanting to say but holding back," but there is another reason. However, this at least refutes a theory: "The arrangement of news is not political." The arrangement is also political, "each taking what they need" is the point.

　　I am very happy to read *Wenhui Daily* because it is fresh, has content, and has a broad coverage. This time I am very sorry to have involved *Wenhui Daily*. Fortunately, there is not a single "ism" or hat in the article, and there is no "judgment" of right and wrong, so it probably won't be regarded as a "club." If it can arouse a little bit of thought in readers and newspaper editors, my wish will be fulfilled. Finally, I hope this short article involving *Wenhui Daily* can be published in the supplement of *Wenhui Daily*. (June 6)

　　录以备考
　　——读报偶感

    同是一条消息，经过不同的编辑同志的编排，其价值竟可以相差十万八千里之遥，这个奇妙的秘诀，是我最近从报纸上得来的。
    前几天毛主席在接见共青团代表时发表了讲话。讲话虽短，含意却极深长。解放日报用特别巨大的铅字和醒目的标题放在第一条新闻，人民日报排在当中，标题比解放日报要小些，也突出了“团结起来，坚决地勇敢地为社会主义的伟大事业而奋斗，一切离开社会主义的言论行动都是错误的。”但文汇报呢，却缩小到简直使粗枝大叶的人找不到的地步，或者看了也觉得这是一条无足轻重的新闻。其全部地位，大约只有解放日报标题用的铅字二个铅字那么大。
    到底是什么缘故使三个报纸编辑部对一条新闻的估价相差如此之远呢？是因为解放日报认为这条消息特别重要呢，还是因为文汇报编者同志觉得这个谈话是谈谈什么社会主义、党的领导……之类早已“听得烂熟”的老话，没有什么新鲜内容，所以无足轻重呢？还是因为编者以为文汇报的读者是知识分子、同青年们没有什么关系？抑还是编者以为突出这条消息，会影响“争鸣”，因为“争鸣”中似乎是不适合多说什么党的领导、社会主义的，我因为说了两句，就很遭到有些人的反对。……
    我不想判别是非，也许各有各的道理，“彼亦一是非，此亦一是非”吧，——因为不同的编报方法也是“争鸣”之一种，毛主席就说过，报纸这样办、那样办就是两家。我也不想去分析其中的优劣，因为现在也还是各人顾各人的方法去办，例如对李维汉的谈话，人民日报是突出了“社会主义是长期共存的政治基础”作为标题，并且用“……总的说来，从各方面提出的批评和意见，有很多是正确的，应该认真地加以接受和处理；有相当一部分是错误的，还须要进一步加以研究和分析”作为副标题，而文汇报则以“中共诚恳欢迎监督和帮助”为标题，以“认为很多批评和意见有助于克服三大主义进一步加强和巩固共产党的核心领导作用”为副标题，明眼人一见就可看出彼此着眼点是不同的。但我以为，这种不同是比“千篇一律”好得多的一种好现象。我更不想去追究各人着眼点不同的心理状态，因为我并无“未卜先知”之才。所以关于是非、优劣、原因，都待进一步加以考证。
    有人要问：你自己就没有见解了吗？答曰：有的。但不想说。不想说的理由呢，答曰：也不想说。这并非如唐弢同志所说的“欲说还休”，而有另一种原因。然而这至少驳倒了一种理论：“新闻的编排是没有政治性”。编排也有政治性，“各取所需”即是。
    我是很欢喜看文汇报的，因为它新鲜、有内容、报道面广。这回确很抱歉，涉及了文汇报。好在文章中并无一个“主义”也没有一顶帽子，也没有“判决”是非，大概不会被人目为“棍子”。如果能引起读报人及编报人一点点思索，我的愿望就达到了。末了，希望这篇涉及文汇报的短文能在文汇报的副刊上登出。　（6月6日）
