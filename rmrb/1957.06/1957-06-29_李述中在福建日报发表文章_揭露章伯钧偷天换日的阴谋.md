Fuzhou, June 28th (from this newspaper) - The Fujian Daily published an article on the 26th written by Li Shuzhong, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, titled "Resolutely Draw a Line Between Ourselves and Zhang Bojun." In the article, Li Shuzhong exposed many of Zhang Bojun's words and deeds against socialism and against the leadership of the Party, and admitted that he had been ideologically poisoned by Zhang Bojun and had accepted Zhang Bojun's propositions against socialism and against the leadership of the Party.

In the article, Li Shuzhong said: Zhang Bojun consciously and intentionally wanted to turn socialism backwards, to the kingdom of capitalism, and he himself was a political careerist issuing orders from the throne of that kingdom. Zhang Bojun often maliciously insulted and distorted Marxism. He said that Marxism-Leninism was nothing more than talking about interpersonal relationships, that is, the social relationships between parents, brothers, couples, and friends. If the relationships are well managed, that is the best Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, he concluded that many Marxist-Leninist masterpieces were at most a few dogmatic rules and regulations, not as good as ancient Chinese books, which had long ago described interpersonal relationships concisely and clearly.

Li Shuzhong wrote: According to Zhang Bojun's statement, it is not necessary to study Marxism-Leninism, it is enough to read a few books by ancient sages. Chinese society does not have to carry out revolution according to the laws of social development; it is possible to revert to feudal society, and it is even more appropriate to revert to capitalist society. If Marxism-Leninism is dogma, what else is left? It is either revisionism or the third line.

Li Shuzhong said in the article: Zhang Bojun's independent approach in political practice is the inevitable result of his hatred of Marxism-Leninism and his hatred of socialism.

Li Shuzhong also exposed Zhang Bojun's set of tricks to tamper with the current national system and the appearance of the CPPCC: "Zhang Bojun once said that the nature of the CPPCC is the upper house, and it must be greatly expanded, expanded to six or seven thousand people. Zhang Bojun also made promises to us, saying that everyone would have the opportunity to be a member of the upper house in the future."

Li Shuzhong believes: "Zhang Bojun's trick is planned and step-by-step. First, he expands the CPPCC into the upper house. The 'political design institute' he proposed this time is his second step. After the first step is successful, isn't Zhang Bojun a ready-made vice chairman of the upper house? Zhang Bojun's set of tricks is very vicious. In the old saying, it is a kind of deception, a method of swapping the sky, a method of gaining an inch, the purpose is to usurp the leadership of the Party. Huang Qixiang said that he wanted to be the Premier of the State Council. I want to further say that after he becomes the Premier, doesn't he have even greater ambitions?"

Li Shuzhong also mentioned that Zhang Bojun ordered the Fujian organization of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party to develop members by any means. In 1955, Zhang Bojun talked a lot about developing several times to several times more members. In February of this year, he heard Zhang Bojun talk a lot about the development line in Beijing. Zhang Bojun said that there are five million intellectuals in China, and the democratic parties should develop at least one or two million people, and the China Democratic League should of course develop more. Over-aged members of the Communist Youth League should be absorbed. Zhang also said that the China Democratic League was founded by him, and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party was supported by him. He has the idea that after Shen Junru is a hundred years old, who else but him can be the chairman of the China Democratic League? If this continues, he is also the chairman of the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, plus the political design institute, isn't that a draw?

Li Shuzhong said in the article: Zhang Bojun also intentionally compared members of democratic parties with Communist Party members. He said: Members of democratic parties are no worse than Communist Party members. At least, Zhang Bojun is no worse than Xing Xiping, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. He also said: The Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party has different opinions on certain specific tasks of the Communist Party, so it is necessary to emphasize independence and being the masters of our own affairs. Li Shuzhong finally admitted that he had been influenced by Zhang Bojun and accepted Zhang Bojun's propositions. He expressed his willingness to draw a clear line with Zhang Bojun and is willing to accept reform. (Attached picture)

　　李述中在福建日报发表文章
    揭露章伯钧偷天换日的阴谋
    本报福州28日电　26日的福建日报发表了农工民主党福建省委员会主任委员李述中写的一篇文章，题目是“坚决和章伯钧划清界线”。李述中在文章中揭露了章伯钧许多反对社会主义、反对党的领导的言行，并承认他受到章伯钧的思想毒化，接受了章伯钧反对社会主义，反对党的领导的主张。
    李述中在文章中说：章伯钧是有意识有企图的想把社会主义拉向后转，转到资本主义的王国，而他自己就是在王国的宝座中发号施令的政治野心家。章伯钧经常恶意污辱歪曲马克思主义。他说，马列主义没有什么，不外讲人事关系，就是父母、兄弟、夫妇、朋友之间相处的社会关系，关系搞好了，就是最好的马列主义。因此，他断定许多马列主义巨著，最多是几个教条法则，倒不如中国古旧著作，早就把人事关系讲得扼要而清楚。
    李述中写到这里说：按照章伯钧的说法，马克思列宁主义可以不要学习，只要读几本古圣贤书就够了。中国社会可以不按照社会发展规律进行革命了，还原到封建社会可以，还原到资本主义社会更适宜。马克思列宁主义如果是教条，另外剩下是什么呢，不是修正主义就是第三条路线。
    李述中在文章中说：章伯钧在政治实践上的独搞一套，就是他憎恨马克思列宁主义，憎恨社会主义的必然结果。
    李述中还揭发了章伯钧想篡改国家现行制度和政协面貌的一套鬼把戏：“章伯钧曾说过，政协的性质就是上议院，并且必须大大扩大，扩大到六、七千人。章伯钧还向我们封官许愿，说你们大家将来都有机会做上议院议员。”
    李述中认为：“章伯钧的鬼把戏是有计划、有步骤的，首先把政协扩大为上议院，这次提出的“政治设计院”是他的第二步骤。第一步走通后，章伯钧不是现成的上议院副主席吗，章伯钧这一套把戏非常恶毒，用旧话说是一种遮眼法，偷天换日法，得寸进尺法，目的是要篡窃党的领导权。黄琪翔说他想作国务院总理，我要进一步说，他作了总理之后，难道就没有更大的野心吗？
    李述中还谈到：章伯钧曾命令农工民主党福建组织不择手段地发展成员，1955年章伯钧就大谈过要发展几倍至几倍，今年2月在北京又听到章伯钧大谈发展路线。章伯钧说，中国知识分子有五百万人，民主党派至少要发展一二百万人，民盟当然要发展更多。青年团员超龄的都要吸收，章又说民盟是他创立起来的，农工民主党是他撑持起来的。他大有沈钧儒百岁之后，民盟主席舍我其谁之概。这样发展下去，他又是民盟和农工民主党主席，加上政治设计院，那不是平分秋色是什么？
    李述中在文章中说：章伯钧还有意的拿民主党派成员和共产党员来较量，他说：民主党派成员不比共产党员差，至少我章伯钧不比中共中央统战部副部长邢西萍差。他还说：农工民主党对共产党某些具体工作大大小小都有不同意见，所以要强调独立当家作主。李述中最后承认，他受到章伯钧的默化，并接受了章伯钧的主张。他表示要和章伯钧划清界限，愿意接受改造。（附图片）
