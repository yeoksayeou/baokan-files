The South Vietnamese Army Under American Control
By Xiao Guang, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

The Feelings and Observations of Two Officers
    In the living room of the Vietnam Journalists Association, two South Vietnamese naval officers who recently defected to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam spoke freely to reporters from various countries stationed in Hanoi about their feelings and observations in the South Vietnamese army.

    Fang Chunxian and Ding Jiaxiang, both twenty-five years old, were mathematics students at Hanoi University during the war. In 1953, they were mobilized to study at the French Brest Naval Academy. Last June, they were sent back to Saigon and served as deputy captains of the South Vietnamese naval transport ships Linjiang and Ningjiang, respectively.

    The Linjiang and Ningjiang ships regularly traveled between Saigon and Con Dao Island and Phu Quoc Island, specializing in transporting prisoners sentenced to exile; the vast majority were convicted merely for demanding peace and unification of the motherland. During their journeys, they suffered abuse and torture from the GVN military police and secret agents; some of the old and weak patients even became emaciated after being forced to go without food, but no one ever succumbed or complained.

    This experience left a deep impression on Fang Chunxian and Ding Jiaxiang. They said: "The savage attitude of the Ngo Dinh Diem government towards patriotic compatriots is no different from that of the former French colonial rulers towards the Vietnamese people. It made us see more and more clearly the anti-people nature of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, and the unwavering patriotic will of the exiles also strengthened our determination to escape the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime."

    They said that the factors that prompted them to turn to the North were more than these. The privileges of the United States in South Vietnam, especially the arrogance and domineering attitude of the American military advisors, made the officers and soldiers of the South Vietnamese army generally feel humiliated; and some non-commissioned officers trained by the French were even more discriminated against and squeezed out. The troops trained by the United States were mostly assigned to important departments and regions, enjoying relatively favorable treatment; other troops could only be stationed in remote or secondary places, and their salaries were also low.

    In Saigon, they saw arrogant Americans everywhere; on the streets, American military vehicles charged around recklessly. American military advisors insisted on working jointly with officials from the South Vietnamese General Staff of National Defense. American officers stationed in Hue cursed loudly because South Vietnamese soldiers had not driven the tanks in time to greet their superiors: "You Vietnamese, you can't do anything"...

    Sometimes, American officers also came to the Linjiang and Ningjiang ships to inspect the work. The most unbearable thing was their catchphrase: "Know that this is an American warship, and you are now under my authority."

    Most of the South Vietnamese soldiers dared to be angry but dared not speak out. But some officers were so angry that they sometimes pretended to be drunk and fought with American officers, as often happened at the Saigon Military Club.

    In South Vietnam, prices have been soaring and the number of poor people has been increasing. Ngo Dinh Diem set fire to the homes of the poor on both sides of the Mekong River, forcing people to go to the Central Highlands to reclaim wasteland. Most of the veterans in the army were also sent to reclaim wasteland or work on rubber plantations. The soldiers in South Vietnam were depressed and could not find their way out. Many people longed for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and friends gathered together to talk about North Vietnam. Although Ngo Dinh Diem strictly forbade listening to North Vietnamese news, news from "Voice of Vietnam" was still secretly circulating among the soldiers.

    In order to boost morale, the South Vietnamese authorities, at the suggestion of American advisors, vigorously promoted "psychological warfare," proclaiming that "the ultimate goal of strengthening the army is to liberate North Vietnam..." etc., but the general soldiers were indifferent to this. The South Vietnamese Naval Command stipulated that political report meetings should be organized every week, but they often could not be convened because not enough people attended; it was even used as a disciplinary measure, and whoever made a mistake would be sent to attend the forum.

    Fang Chunxian and Ding Jiaxiang stated: What they talked about was only bits and pieces of the situation, but judging from the situation reflected in the South Vietnamese newspapers and other people who came to North Vietnam, they had outlined a microcosm of the South Vietnamese army; at present, the South Vietnamese army is entirely under the control of the United States, but at the same time, anti-American sentiment is beginning to grow.

    The United States Replaces France

    The United States began to vigorously squeeze out French forces as soon as the Indochina armistice began, and then seized real power in South Vietnam's political, economic, and military affairs.

    For more than two years since the armistice, the United States has provided South Vietnam with no less than 750 million U.S. dollars in military aid and has imported a large number of weapons to South Vietnam; sixteen high-level delegations from the United States, including Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, Deputy Secretary of State Robertson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, and commanders of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, have visited South Vietnam one after another.

    In the spring of 1955, the United States eliminated the pro-French religious armed forces in South Vietnam through the Ngo Dinh Diem clique; some officers originally cultivated by the French, such as Li Wensi, Nguyen Wen Dun, Yang Wenming, and Nguyen Yu-shu, were promoted to generals and lieutenant generals, respectively, but their real power was greatly reduced; the South Vietnamese General Staff of National Defense, originally responsible for Li Wensi, was changed to a research-oriented department.

    Last June, the United States completely abolished the former French military institutions and established American military institutions, including the American advisory group, which directly controlled and trained the South Vietnamese army. Ngo Dinh Diem stopped sending officers to France to study and instead sent officers to the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to study. In addition to controlling the leadership of South Vietnam's military departments and military schools, the United States also established advisors in various military regions and divisions. The number of American military advisors increased rapidly from 391 in September 1955 to 1,700 in September 1956, and has increased to 2,000 this year, not including their Japanese and Filipino assistants.

    Under the support of the United States, the South Vietnamese army has continued to expand. At present, South Vietnam's armed forces have reached 262,000 people. Among them, the regular army has 155,000 people; the security corps has 54,000 people; and the civil guard corps has 53,000 people. In terms of organization, it has been equipped with four field divisions, six light divisions, thirteen local regiments, five mechanized regiments, ten 105mm howitzer battalions, and four mortar companies. The navy and air force have 242 aircraft and 172 ships, with a total tonnage of 10,700 tons.

    This year, the United States mainly plans to carry out the following three tasks.

    The first is to expand the army by 12,000 to 20,000 people. Due to the opposition of the South Vietnamese people and the cold eyes of the young people, the South Vietnamese authorities cannot recruit soldiers and have to send troops to the countryside to catch recruits, organize theatrical performances, gatherings, and ball games to lure young people, and force them to enlist. Secondly, in terms of organization, they will step up the establishment of corps and strengthen the security corps to replace the regular army in carrying out suppression tasks. Third, they are preparing to build the Central Highlands base into a strategic base. The United States believes that to control the South, it must control the Central Highlands. At the beginning of this year, the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem group has set up two construction sites in the northwest of Buon Ma Thuot and the northeast of Bo Lai Zu and transferred several thousand elderly security corps personnel to carry out development work with their families. The transportation lines along the coast of the Central Highlands are contracted to American companies for construction. A large airport near Buon Ma Thuot will soon be completed and can be used for heavy aircraft to take off and land.

    Morale Generally Low

    In contrast to the active expansion and war preparation activities of the United States, the morale of the South Vietnamese army is generally low. According to Nguyen Jinjin, a lieutenant in the artillery of the 21st Division of South Vietnam who defected to Hanoi in March of this year, the South Vietnamese soldiers hate war. After the restoration of peace, everyone was waiting for the North and South to be unified and waiting to return home safely after their service expired; therefore, Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to negotiate general elections was very unpopular. In addition, Ngo Dinh Diem organized the so-called "accusation of the Communist Party" movement in the army and promoted the American-style control system, which aroused dissatisfaction among the soldiers. Many non-commissioned officers are uneasy and let their wives go outside to do some small business, preparing for their future way out of the army. More and more people are deserting, sometimes reaching two or three thousand a month. In the past, it was stipulated that desertion should be tried by the military court, but because there were too many people running away, they had no choice but to not delve into it.

    Although American "psychological warfare" experts and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's "National Revolutionary Movement" have done a lot of work in the army, this policy of expanding the army and preparing for war still arouses more and more resentment. The South Vietnamese soldiers reflect: "What is the point of advancing north? Advancing north is just to kill our compatriots, and even we will be finished."

    Anti-American Sentiment Grows

    The South Vietnamese army cannot stand the arrogance and domineering of the American advisors, and people are talking about: What is the difference between the current United States and the past France?

    Anti-American sentiment is growing rapidly.

    On October 1st of last year, when U.S. Navy General Storm visited Chengwang Province in South Vietnam, he loudly lectured the officers and soldiers of the Second Military Region of South Vietnam, "You must work hard to practice and build a strong army to eliminate communism." Although the superiors repeatedly mobilized them, the audience did not applaud, and people just asked each other: "What right does the Americans have to give us orders?" In the military officers' school in the Second Military Region, an American lieutenant publicly insulted the battalion commander of the 41st Battalion of the Military Region, which aroused great dissatisfaction. The students said: No matter what level of officer you are, as long as you "touch" the Americans, you will be unlucky. Some students automatically returned to their original units and were unwilling to continue their studies.

    In the Third and Fourth Military Regions, many officers were unwilling to report the situation of the troops to American advisors and made excuses to avoid them whenever American advisors came down to inspect the work. Some communication departments, because they were dissatisfied with the opinions and style of American advisors, did not solicit their opinions at all when carrying out the project of setting up a long-distance telephone line from South Vietnam to the Central Region. And it is becoming increasingly common for drivers and cooks to work passively and for the company not to salute the American flag or American advisors.

    The American military institutions have noticed this sentiment and have issued instructions to American officers stationed in South Vietnam, asking them to "behave more humbly." But merely "behaving" is not enough. If the United States continues to violate the Geneva Accords, implement a policy of expanding the army and preparing for war, and enslave the South Vietnamese people, the anti-American sentiment of the South Vietnamese army will become more and more intense, and that "cold wind" or "hot wind" that swept through Iceland and the Philippines last year will sooner or later appear on the land from Bianhai River to Jinou Cape.

　　美国控制下的南越军队
　　本报驻越南记者  萧光
　　两个军官的感受和见闻
    在越南记者协会的客厅里，最近投奔到越南民主共和国来的两位南越海军军官，向各国驻河内的记者畅谈他们在南越军队中的感受和见闻。
    方春闲和丁家祥，这两位都是二十五岁的年轻人，战时曾是河内大学数学系的学生，1953年被动员到法国勃瑞司脱海军学校学习，去年6月被送回西贡，分别担任南越海军林江运输舰和宁江运输舰副舰长的职务。
    林江、宁江两只船，经常往来于西贡和昆仑岛、富国岛之间，专负责载运被判处流放的犯人；其中绝大多数的罪名仅仅是要求祖国和平、统一。他们在旅途中，受尽吴庭艳宪兵、特务的虐待和折磨；一些老弱病员甚至在被迫断食后变得奄奄一息，但从不见有人屈服或叫苦。
    这段经历给方春闲和丁家祥留下的印象很深，他们说：“吴庭艳政府对待爱国同胞的态度之野蛮，简直同从前法国殖民统治者对待越南人没有两样。它使我们越来越看透吴庭艳政权的反人民本质，而流放者不屈的爱国意志也加强了我们逃出吴庭艳政权统治的决心。”
    他们说，促使他们投向北方的因素还不止这些。美国在南越的特权，特别是美国军事顾问的嚣张和跋扈，使得南越军队的官兵普遍感到屈辱；而一些由法国训练出来的士官，更受到歧视和排挤。美国训练的部队，大都分配在重要部门和地区，享受着比较优厚的待遇；旁的部队只能驻扎在边远或次要的地方，薪饷也低。
    在西贡，他们到处看见趾高气扬的美国人；大街上，美国的军用汽车横冲直闯。美国军事顾问硬要同南越国防总参谋部的官员联合办公。驻顺化的美国军官，因为南越士兵没有能及时驾驶坦克去迎接他的上级，便破口大骂：“你们越南人，什么事也干不成”……
    有时候，美国军官也上林江和宁江号来检查工作，最难忍受的是他们的口头语：“要知道这是美国军舰，你们现在是在我的权力之下。”
    大多数的南越士兵敢怒而不敢言。但有些军官实在气愤不过，有时就装着酒醉和美国军官殴打，像西贡军人俱乐部经常发生的那样。
    在南越，物价一直飞涨，穷人不断增加。吴庭艳纵火焚烧湄公河两岸的贫民住所，逼迫人们去西原开荒。军队中的老兵也大都被送去开荒或是橡胶园里做工。南越的士兵情绪愁闷，找不到自己的出路。许多人对越南民主共和国心向往之，知己朋友聚在一起就谈北越。尽管吴庭艳严禁收听北越新闻，“越南之声”的消息照样暗地里在士兵当中流传。
    为了提高士气，南越当局在美国顾问的倡议下，大力推行“心理战”，宣传什么“加强军队的最后目的是为了解放北越……”等等，但一般军人对此表示冷淡。南越海军司令部规定每周组织政治报告会，由于到会的人太不踊跃而时常召开不成；下面更把它作为一种纪律处分，谁犯了错误就派谁去参加座谈会。
    方春闲和丁家祥声明：他们谈到的只是点点滴滴的情况，但是从南越的报刊和其他到北越来
  的人反映的情况来看，他们已勾出了南越军队的一个缩影；目前，南越军队已全部处在美国的控制下，但同时反美情绪也正在开始滋长。
    美国取代法国
    美国在印度支那停战一开始，就对法国势力大事排挤，进而掌握南越政治、经济和军事方面的实权。
    停战两年多来，美国给南越的军事援助不下七亿五千万美元，向南越输入了大批武器；美国的十六个高级代表团，包括副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯、副国务卿罗伯逊、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、海陆空军司令等，纷纷到南越进行访问。
    1955年春天，美国通过吴庭艳集团消灭了南越亲法的教派武装力量；把原来法国培养的一些军官，如黎文斯、阮文敦、杨文明、阮玉书等，分别提升为大将、中将，但实权却大大减少；原来黎文斯负责的南越国防总参谋部，被改变为研究性质的部门。
    去年6月，美国全部撤销了过去法国的军事机构，成立了包括美国顾问团在内的美国军事机构，直接掌握和训练南越的军队。吴庭艳停止向法国派遣军官留学，而改派军官去美国、日本和菲律宾学习。美国除了掌握着南越各军事部门、军事学校的领导权外，并在各个军区和师团设立顾问。美国军事顾问的人数，从1955年9月的三百九十一名迅速增加到1956年9月的一千七百名，今年又增到二千名，还不包括他们的日本和菲律宾籍助理人员。
    南越军队在美国的扶植下不断得到扩充。目前，南越武装力量已达到二十六万二千人。其中，正规军十五万五千人；保安团五万四千人；民卫团五万三千人。在建制方面，已装备了四个野战师，六个轻装师，十三个地方团，五个机械团，十个一○五炮营和四个迫击炮连。海空军方面有二百四十二架飞机，一百七十二艘舰艇，吨位共达一万零七百吨。
    今年，美国主要计划进行以下三项工作。
    一是扩军一万二千到二万人。由于南越人民的反对和青年们的冷眼相待，南越当局招募不到兵员，只得派军队下乡抓丁，组织演剧、集会、球赛等引诱青年，并强迫入伍。其次在建制方面，将加紧建立军团，加强保安团力量，以它代替正规军执行镇压任务。第三，准备将西原基地建为战略基地。美国认为掌握南方一定要掌握西原。今年年初，美国—吴庭艳集团已在邦美蜀西北和波莱左东北设立两处工地，调了几千名上了年纪的保安团人员携同家属去从事开发工作。西原沿海的交通线交由美国公司负责建筑。邦美蜀附近的大型机场即将完工，可以供重型飞机起飞和降落。
    士气普遍低落
    同美国积极扩军备战的活动相反，南越军队的士气普遍低落。据今年3月投奔到河内来的南越第二十一师炮兵中尉阮进金谈，南越士兵们厌恶战争。和平恢复后，人人等待南北统一、等待服役期满平安回家；所以吴庭艳拒绝协商普选很不得人心。加以吴庭艳在军队中组织所谓“控诉共产党”运动，推行美国式的控制制度，更引起军人们的不满。许多士官不安心，让妻子到外面去作点小买卖，准备自己脱离军队后的生活出路。开小差的越来越多，有时一个月达两三千人。过去规定开小差由军事法院审讯，但因为逃跑的实在太多，只好不加深究。
    尽管美国的“心理战”专家和吴庭艳集团的“国家革命运动”在军队中进行许多工作，这种扩军备战政策仍然引起越来越多的反感。南越的士兵们反映：“北进个什么，北进不过就是去杀害自己的同胞，而且连自己也得归于尽。”
    反美情绪增长
    南越的军队看不惯美国顾问的横行霸道，人们纷纷议论：现在的美国同过去的法国究竟有什么不同？
    反美的情绪正在迅速增长。
    去年10月1日，美国海军大将斯统姆访问南越承王省的时候，大声教训南越第二军区的官兵“必须努力练习，建立一支强大的军队来消灭共产主义”。虽然上级再三动员，听众也不鼓掌，人们只是互相询问：“美国人凭什么给我们下命令？”在第二军区的军官学校里，一个美国中尉当众辱骂这个军区第四十一营营长，引起了很大不满，学员们说：不管你是哪一级军官，只要“碰”了美国人就得倒霉。有些学员自动回到原单位，不愿意继续学习。
    在第三和第四军区，许多军官不肯向美国顾问报告部队情况，每当美国顾问下来检查工作，就借故避开。有的通讯部门因为不满意美国顾问的意见和作风，在进行架设从南越到中部的远距离电线的工程时，根本不向他们征求意见。而司机、炊事员消极怠工，连队不向美国国旗、美国顾问敬礼的事，也正在变得屡见不鲜。
    美国军事机构注意到这种情绪，已向美国驻南越的军官发出指示，要他们“表现得谦逊一点”。但仅仅“表现”是不够的，如果美国继续在南越破坏日内瓦协议，推行扩军备战的政策，奴役南越人民，南越军队反美的情绪将越来越高涨，而去年吹遍冰岛和菲律宾的那股“冷风”或“热风”，也迟早会在从边海河到金瓯角的土地上出现。
