Chengdu, June 15th (from this newspaper) - The Sichuan Provincial Committee and the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) held an enlarged meeting of their standing committees on the afternoon of the 15th, with over 40 people in attendance. The participants unanimously and angrily refuted the erroneous anti-Communist and anti-socialist arguments that have appeared within the CDL's central and local organizations.

Zhang Zehou, a member of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the CDL, said that the CDL has been led to the brink of danger by a few careerists, and league members should rise up and push the CDL to turn left.

The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the CDL Central Committee, on behalf of all league members in the province, protest against the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun and others, and hold them accountable. The resolution also demanded that the CDL Central Committee answer the following questions:

	1. Why did the CDL Central Committee fail to promptly express its attitude towards the erroneous remarks? Please examine what problems exist in your guiding ideology.
	2. Please examine the trends within the CDL. Has the CDL's socialist stance been shaken?
	3. Some people say that the remarks of Chu Anping and Chen Xingui have supporters. Who is supporting them, and what is their purpose?
	4. Some people have pointed out that there are right-wing careerists taking advantage of the rectification movement to muddy the waters. Who are the careerists within the League?

The resolution concluded with the following suggestions to the CDL Central Committee: 1. The CDL Central Committee should promptly organize the entire league to conduct critical discussions of anti-socialist remarks, in order to draw a clear line and distinguish between right and wrong. 2. The CDL Central Committee is requested to draw conclusions from the discussions and make them public. 3. It is suggested that the CDL Central Committee convene a congress of league members or an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee within this year to review its work and improve its leadership.

　　四川盟员质问民盟中央
    盟内野心家是谁？
    本报成都15日电　民盟四川省委、成都市委15日下午举行常委扩大会议，到会四十多人，一致愤怒驳斥民盟中央和地方组织中出现的一些反共产党反社会主义的谬论。
    民盟成都市委员张泽厚说，民盟已被少数野心家带到危险边沿，盟员应起来推动民盟向左转。
    会议通过决议，决议以全省盟员名义向盟中央要求对章伯钧等的错误言论表示抗议，并追究责任。决议并要求盟中央答复如下质问：
    一、盟中央为何对错误言论不及时表明态度，请检查领导思想上存在什么问题；二、请盟中央检查民盟的动向是什么，对社会主义立场是否动摇；三、有人说储安平、陈新桂的言论有人支持，是谁在支持，目的何在；四、有人指出有右派野心家利用整风混水摸鱼，盟内野心家是谁？
    决议最后向盟中央建议：一、盟中央迅速组织全盟对反社会主义言论进行批判讨论，以划清界限，辨明是非；二、要求盟中央对讨论作出结论，公诸社会；三、建议盟中央在本年内召开盟员代表大会或中委扩大会议，检查工作，改进领导。
