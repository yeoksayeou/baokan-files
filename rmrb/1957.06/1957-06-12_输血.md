　　Blood Transfusion
　　Li An
　　Little Hui from upstairs has measles, and Fei Tianmao next door has measles. I hold my precious Long baby all day long, not even daring to cross the threshold.
　　Finally, I managed to get another Sunday. I urged and urged, practically forcing Zhuowu to take the baby to the hospital for a blood transfusion. Constantly staying indoors like this isn’t a solution to prevent measles.
　　"Look...can't you see I'm busy?" He had his feet propped up on a stool and was writing a letter to that damned Chen Erhuzi again.
　　If I wasn't pregnant now, I wouldn't need his help at all. I snatched the pen from his hand: "You...you don't care about our Long baby...Chen Erhuzi, writing today, writing yesterday, you've already sent him eighteen registered letters...got anything out of it?!"
　　 "Don't bother me, okay, my dear wife..." He didn't even look at me, his red-faced, plump cheeks were dripping with sweat. Look, always eating "blood-tonifying angelica essence," always eating "blood-tonifying angelica essence," he's bound to become as fat as a Ningxiang pig [Note]. Now that it's getting hot, I don't want to sleep with him in the same bed. He seemed to notice I was snickering at him behind his back, and turned his head to give me a cold glare: "Don't worry, darling, once I find Chen Erdie and bring him to the mine, well, he’ll be a Party Committee’s Organization Minister. I can afford to take care of him… Uh, rest assured, taking care of him won't cost you your high heels..."
　　"You...you..." My voice was hoarse with anger.
　　He immediately put on a smiling face: "Little child, having a little son, you're still a little child...just making a joke, why are you pouting?" He came over and touched my hair, saying, "There's a new lead. A friend sent a letter yesterday. My Chen Erdie, he went out to live as a vagrant a year before the Liberation. I want to write a letter to ask which direction he went in, so I can place a missing person advertisement in those newspapers."
　　"Look, you really are a compassionate saint..."
　　"What else can I do? Conscience, look, conscience...that year, I was so badly injured, and there was nowhere to find type B blood. If it wasn't for him giving me 600cc, uh, you wouldn't be my wife..." His face darkened: "That stubborn old man, left right after donating the blood...Alas, I really regret it. If I had forced him to accept this Parker pen from me, that would have settled this troublesome matter..."
　　"Let's go to the hospital, we can talk about these things later. Let's go to the hospital, Zhuowu." I looked at the watch on my wrist, glanced at the Long baby sleeping in my arms. The registration time is almost over. I felt like there was a cat scratching in my heart.
　　"Uh, so stubborn...the hospital's blood bank is so big, they have as much as you want. Twenty cubic centimeters, it only costs two yuan."
　　"Money? Who cares about money? The doctor said that parents' blood is the most effective for preventing measles."
　　"Do you know how many sleepless nights I've had recently? Look," he sat down on the stool impatiently.
　　"It's good to be a little thinner."
　　"See, see what a thoughtful wife...look, Chen Erdie's blood, full of class love, I have no right, I have no right to waste it arbitrarily..." The pen scratched against the paper again, rustling.
　　My nose tingled. I covered Long baby's face with a towel, pushed open the door, and ran out in a fit of anger.
　　The mining town was very lively on Sunday. I walked where there were fewer people and soon arrived at the People's Hospital.
　　The doctor was a woman, but she had a pair of bright, masculine eyes. She looked at Long baby and asked, "Comrade, are you his..."
　　"My little boy."
　　"Mm," she saw my big belly, nodded, and then asked, "Where is his father?"
　　"He...he went to Bei...Beijing on a business trip." It was indeed difficult to learn to lie. I didn't even believe my own words.
　　The doctor gave a heavy "hm." I could tell that she was sparing my self-esteem by not exposing the lie. She stood up, "Please wait a moment, I'll go call someone for a blood transfusion. Look, comrade, this, you need to understand, in our society, blood transfusions are not for the sake of two yuan..." The door clicked shut, and she went out.
　　I felt like countless insects were crawling on my face. Just as I was about to back out, the doctor walked in with a thin old man. He didn't have many muscles on his face, but his eyes were bright. He smiled at me, picked up Long baby, and kissed him heavily. He immediately rolled up his sleeve, revealing a sturdy arm.
　　My heart almost jumped out of my throat. Look, the fat, strong Zhuowu was hiding at home, not showing his face, while a stranger was about to be cut open. This was absurd. I had already told one lie, so I'd tell another one:
　　"No, no, uh, why, I forgot to bring money today..."
　　The old man just smiled at me.
　　The doctor gave me a cold stare: "Money...he's a worker at the printing factory, from the voluntary blood donation team..."
　　That look was like a sharp knife, piercing my heart: "Oh...oh..." I snatched Long baby back and ran towards the door.
　　The old man blocked me: "Sister-in-law, the doctor said his father is in Beijing, and you are expecting...Sister-in-law."
　　I pushed him away and ran out of the People's Hospital for my life.
　　Back in the courtyard of the dormitory, my body really couldn't take it anymore. I sat down on a stone. After resting for a while, I shouted to the room:
　　"Zhuowu, come out and take the baby."
　　"Ah, you're back..." My husband answered from inside the window: "Wait a moment, just a moment, only the signature is left on this letter..."
　　Outside the bamboo fence, someone was looking around. He saw me and immediately ran over.
　　"You...you are such a stubborn sister-in-law..."
　　It turned out to be the old man who had followed me. I stared at him blankly, not knowing how to deal with the situation.
　　He came to take Long baby from my arms. My hands trembled. If there was a hole in the courtyard, how wonderful it would be to crawl into it.
　　Zhuowu had probably finished writing the letter. He stretched lazily at the door and walked towards me. He spotted the old man, his eyes widened, widened... Suddenly, he pounced over: "Oh...Second Father, my Chen Erdie, oh, I..."
　　Chen Erdie looked at Long baby, looked at him. He stood there like an iron Bodhisattva, motionless, motionless...

　　输血
　　李岸
    楼上的小慧子出了麻疹，隔壁的费天毛出了麻疹，我整天搂着我的龙宝贝，门槛都不敢跨了。
    好容易又捞着一个礼拜天了，我死催硬催，催卓吾上医院给宝宝输血，这样老是关门闭户的，不是个防麻疹的办法呀。
    “呶……你没有看见我正忙着吗？”他把一双脚盘在凳子上，又在给那个该死的陈二胡子写信了。
    如果我现在没有怀孕，压根儿不劳他的驾，我把他手中的钢笔夺过来：“你……你不疼我们的龙宝贝……陈二胡子，今天写，昨天写，你已经给他寄了十八封挂号信了……捞了一个屁？！”
      “别打扰我好不好，我的太太……”他看都不看我，红光满面的胖脸膛直淌汗。呶，老是吃“补血当归精”，老是吃“补血当归精”，一定会胖得像个宁乡猪〔注〕。天热了，我可不乐意和他睡在一张床上哩。他似乎发现我在背后叽笑他，扭过头来冷冷地瞟了我一眼：“放心，太太，找着陈二爹，把他接到矿山来，呶，一个党委会的组织部长嘛，养得起他……呃，你放心，养了他，不会少你的高跟鞋……”
    “你……你……”我的嗓子都气哑了。
    他马上堆下一脸笑：“小孩子，有了小儿子，你还是个小孩子……开句玩笑，干吗当真噘嘴巴啦？”他走过来，摸着我的头发说：“有了新线索，有个朋友昨天来了一封信，我的陈二爹，解放前一年就到外面过流浪生活了，我想去信问一问，看往哪个方向去了，好在那些报纸上登寻人启事。”
    “呶，你真是个大慈大悲的圣人啊……”
    “有什么办法呢？良心，呶，良心……那一年，我受了那么重的伤，B型的血又没有地方找，如果没有他老人家给我输六百西西，呃，你这个太太也当不成了……”他的脸色阴沉下去了：“那个硬老头，输了血就走……唉，我真后悔，要是强迫他受了我这枝派克钢笔，也了却了这桩麻脑袋的事……”
    “上医院，这些事等一会儿谈，上医院，卓吾。”我看着手腕上的表，瞧瞧睡在怀里的龙宝贝，挂号的时间快过了。心里好像有一只猫儿在抓。
    “呃，真固执……医院的血库那么大，要多少，有多少，二十个西西，只用两元钱嘛。”
    “钱？谁在计较钱？医生说，防麻疹，父母的血最见效。”
    “你知道，我最近熬了几个通宵？呶”他不耐烦地坐到凳上。
    “瘦一点也好。”
    “瞧，瞧这个体贴丈夫的好太太……呶，陈二爹这充满阶级友爱的血，没权利，我没有权利任意消耗它……”钢笔又磨擦着信纸沙沙地响了。
    我的鼻尖酸溜溜的，用毛巾蒙着龙宝贝的脸，推开房门，一气奔了出去。
    礼拜天的矿工城甚是热闹，我拣人少的地方走，一会儿就到人民医院了。
    大夫是女的，却有一双男性的明亮的眼睛，她看了看龙宝贝，问：“同志，你是他的……”
    “我的小儿。”
    “嗯”她看见我挺着一个大肚子，点点头，接着问：“他爸爸呢？”
    “他……他到北……北京出差去了。”要学会扯谎的确困难，我连自己也不相信自己的话。
    大夫重重地“唔”了一声，听得出，她是为了照顾我的自尊心才没有揭破谜底的。她站起来：“请等等，我去叫一个输血的来。呶，同志，这个嘛，你无论如何需要弄清楚，在我们的社会里，输血不是为两个钱……”门咔嚓一声，她出去了。
    我的脸上好像有数不清的虫在爬，正准备退出去的时候，大夫陪着一个瘦瘦的老头子走进来，他脸上的肌肉不多，眼睛却炯炯有神，他对我笑一笑，抱过龙宝贝，重重地吻了一下。立刻捞上了衣袖，现出一条结实的胳膊来。
    我的心差点从喉咙里跳出来了。呶，胖胖的、身强力壮的卓吾躲在家里不露面，倒要在一个陌生的瘦老头身上开刀，这成什么话啊，反正扯了一回谎，我再扯一次：
    “不，不，呶，怎么，今天忘记带钱来了……”
    老汉只对着我笑。
    大夫冷冷地盯我一眼：“钱……他是印刷厂的工人，义务输血队的……”
    那眼光好比一把尖刀，钻进我的心脏里：“哦……哦……”我抢过龙宝贝，就往门口跑。
    老头挡住我：“嫂子，大夫说，他爸爸在北京，你又有喜……嫂子。”
    我推开他，没命地奔出了人民医院。
    回到宿舍的天井里，我的身体实在支持不住了，在一块石头上面坐下来。歇一阵，我对屋里喊：
    “卓吾，出来接接小宝宝。”
    “啊，回啦……”丈夫在窗户里面答应着：“等一下，只等一下，这封信只剩下落款了……”
    竹篱笆外面，一个人正在东张西望，他发现了我，马上跑过来。
    “你……你这个嫂子，真固执……”
    原来是那个老汉跟上来了，我怔怔地望着他，不知道怎样对付。
    他来夺我怀中的龙宝贝，我的手直发抖，天井里如果有一个地洞，我钻进去那将多么好啊。
    卓吾大概把信写完了，他在门口伸了一个懒腰，往我身边走来，发现了老头，他的眼睛睁大了，睁大了……突然，他扑过来：“哦……二爹，我的陈二爹，哦，我……”
    陈二爹看看龙宝贝，看看他，他像一尊铁菩萨钉在原地，一动不动，一动不动……
      〔注〕一种品种优良的猪。
