Do a Good Job of Summer Harvest Distribution in Agricultural Cooperatives

The summer harvest season has arrived, and agricultural cooperatives in areas with two crops a year will soon be conducting summer harvest distributions. The broad masses of cooperative members are concerned about whether this year's summer harvest distribution can be done better than last year.

Currently, various contradictions exist within agricultural cooperatives, and these contradictions tend to be concentrated and manifested through income distribution. Therefore, we must make the greatest efforts to do a good job in income distribution. Only by doing a good job in this area can we promote the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of agricultural production.

Some people say: This year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have universally implemented the "three guarantees" method of contracting work, output, and costs. As long as each team calculates its accounts, the summer harvest distribution for the entire cooperative will be easy to do. This idea oversimplifies the problem. In fact, this year's summer harvest distribution faces very complex situations. For example, after the final accounting of last autumn's distribution, "overspending households" and "empty distribution households" generally appeared in cooperatives in various regions. It is estimated that overspending households generally account for about 20% to 30% of the total number of cooperative members' households, and in some cooperatives, overspending households even account for more than half. This has increased the contradictions between cooperative members and the cooperative, as well as among cooperative members themselves. In cooperatives where the economic conditions of each production team differ greatly, there are now disputes over unified distribution versus "whoever plants, harvests." Some cooperatives have not yet settled last year's old accounts, and this year's new accounts have not been fully established. There are many instances of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds in these cooperatives. All of this makes cooperative members feel dissatisfied and uneasy. It is impossible to properly handle such complex problems and make the summer harvest distribution results satisfactory to the majority of cooperative members without doing meticulous work.

The first thing that needs to be carefully handled in the summer harvest distribution is how much to deduct from income. Last year, cooperatives in various regions followed the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," distributing 60% to 70% of the income to cooperative members, ensuring that the majority of cooperative members increased their income. This was correct. However, many cooperatives one-sidedly emphasized "less deduction and more distribution," failing to repay national loans that were due, retaining too little for the cooperative's public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and the working capital necessary for next year's production, and failing to repay cooperative members' production materials at depreciated prices as required. As a result, many new contradictions and difficulties arose. In this year's summer harvest distribution, we should also pay attention to distributing the majority of the income to cooperative members, but at the same time, we must also avoid the shortcomings that occurred last year. This means that in the summer harvest distribution, all aspects must be taken into consideration and arranged reasonably. Agricultural taxes should be paid as usual; loans that are due should be repaid as much as possible; sufficient production expenses for the second half of the year should be retained; public accumulation and public welfare funds should also be appropriately retained; and then the remainder should be distributed to cooperative members. Only in this way can we truly achieve a comprehensive consideration of the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the cooperative members.

There are also many issues that need attention in the portion distributed to cooperative members. First, there is the contradiction between poor villages and rich villages. Some cooperatives are large, and the economic conditions between teams (villages) vary greatly, and the contradictions are very sharp. Last year, incidents of collective concealment of output and collective looting of grain occurred. A better way to prevent such incidents is to take care of the rich villages in the contracted output targets, so that they can receive more overproduction rewards than the poor villages. It is also possible to contract out some sideline occupations suitable for production team management, as well as some forests, orchards, and wasteland, to the production teams, so that production teams with better economic conditions can receive more income. In addition, there are cases where, due to the large differences in the number of farm work contracted, or for other reasons, the work points earned by each team vary greatly. This problem should also be identified and resolved reasonably.

Second, there is the problem of overspending households and empty distribution households. This problem must be properly resolved in the summer harvest distribution. The handling of overspending households should be specifically analyzed, and arrangements should be made separately according to the different situations of each household, helping them to work more in the cooperative and helping them to arrange household sideline occupations and family life. At the same time, they should be asked to repay the overspending funds separately. Some households cannot repay all of them during the summer harvest distribution period, and they should also be helped to develop a repayment plan in installments. Related to the issue of overspending funds is the issue of "empty distribution households." These are mainly those cooperative members with more labor and diligence, who are dissatisfied with the cooperative's arrears in their due income. In the summer harvest distribution, the cooperative should actively pay off these debts. If they cannot be fully repaid for a while, a plan should also be made for regular repayment, and there should be no unwarranted delays.

Third, there is the issue of the treatment of cooperative cadres. This year, cooperative cadres generally participated in production labor. Some cooperatives have implemented the method of "fixed work production, fixed subsidy, and year-end bonus" for the treatment of cooperative cadres, and both cooperative members and cadres are satisfied. However, there are still some cooperatives that have not correspondingly stipulated a method for cadre subsidies after cadres participate in production labor, which needs to be resolved in the summer harvest distribution. In addition, appropriate arrangements should also be made for the "five guarantees" households, handicraft households, fishing households, peddlers, etc. in the summer harvest distribution.

The distribution of grain should be carried out in accordance with the principles stipulated by the state: All surplus grain cooperatives must first complete the state purchase tasks and then carry out internal distribution within the cooperative. After ensuring the necessary rations, feed, and seeds for the entire cooperative, if there is surplus grain, it can be distributed to those cooperative members who have done more work points. Last year, some cooperatives' practices did not fully comply with this principle. Some distributed grain entirely according to labor work points, resulting in a large disparity in the income of cooperative members, with some people having more grain than they could eat and some people not having enough grain to eat. Some cooperatives distributed grain entirely on a per capita basis, and those who did less work points did not compensate for the over-distributed grain prices, becoming overspending households, so those who did more work points suffered losses. Such problems should be avoided this year. All surplus grain cooperatives should ensure both the necessary rations for all cooperative members and take care of the needs of those cooperative members who have done more work points. For some cooperative members with less labor income who temporarily do not have the strength to buy back all the rations they are entitled to, this part of the grain should be handled by the agricultural cooperative as revolving grain.

Since the spring of this year, the broad masses of cooperative members have been eager to know and supervise the cooperative's financial income and expenditure, and have requested to make decisions on various important issues related to income distribution through full discussion. Therefore, this summer harvest distribution will be a major test for each agricultural cooperative to implement the principle of democratic management. The leading cadres of each cooperative should earnestly value the right of cooperative members to be the masters of their own affairs economically, fully promote democracy in the process of preparing for and carrying out the summer harvest distribution, and consult with the masses on various issues. At the same time, they should also recognize that income distribution is related to the interests of all aspects and all kinds of people. The problems it has to solve are so intricate and complex that if the collective wisdom of the cooperative members is not fully utilized, and the distribution is done behind closed doors by a few cooperative cadres, it will not be done well under any circumstances.

The leading organs and agricultural cooperatives in various regions should also pay attention to not limiting their efforts to distributing summer income, but also grasping the various problems exposed in the distribution, seriously analyzing and studying them, finding solutions, and doing a better job in production and financial work in the second half of the year.

The time of summer harvest distribution is also the busy season for sowing late autumn crops and field management in summer. Therefore, attention should be paid to closely combining the summer harvest distribution work with the current production, and preventing the phenomenon of relaxing production due to accounting and grain distribution.

### 做好农业社的夏收分配

    做好农业社的夏收分配
    夏收季节已到，一年两熟地区的农业合作社就要进行夏收分配了。广大的社员都在关心今年的夏收分配是不是能比去年做得好些。
    目前各地农业合作社里存在着这样那样的一些矛盾，这些矛盾往往通过收益分配而集中地表现出来。因此我们就必须用最大的努力做好收益分配工作。只有做好这方面的工作，才能促进合作社的巩固和农业生产的发展。
    有人说：今年各地合作社普遍实行了包工、包产、包成本的“三包”办法，只要各队把账一算，全社的夏收分配很容易做。这种想法是把问题看得太简单了。实际上今年的夏收分配面临着十分复杂的情况。比如去年秋季分配决算以后，各地合作社里普遍出现了“超支户”和“分空户”。估计一般社的超支户约占社员总户数20％—30％，有些社的超支户甚至多到一半以上。这就增加了社员与社之间以及社员相互之间的矛盾。在各生产队经济条件相差悬殊的合作社里，现在又发生了统一分配还是谁种谁收的争论。有一部分合作社去年的老账还没有结清，今年的新账还没有完全建立，这些社里有不少贪污和挪用公款的现象。这些都使得社员们感到不满和不安。要妥善地处理这样一些复杂的问题，使夏收分配的结果为广大社员所满意，不做细致的工作是不行的。
    夏收分配中首先需要慎重处理的，是从收入中扣除多少的问题。去年各地合作社按照“少扣多分”的原则，把收入的60％—70％分给了社员，保证多数社员增加了收入。这是正确的。但是也有不少合作社片面地强调“少扣多分”，到期的国家贷款没有归还，社的公积金、公益金和下年度生产所必需的流动资金都留得太少，欠社员的生产资料折价款没有按规定偿还。结果发生了许多新的矛盾和困难。在今年的夏收分配中，还应该注意把收入的大部分分给社员，但是，同时也要注意避免去年发生的缺点。这就是说：在夏收分配的时候，各个方面都要统筹兼顾，合理安排。农业税应该照交；到期的贷款应该尽力归还；下半年的生产费用应该留够；公积金、公益金也应该适当地留一点；然后再分配给社员。只有这样，才能真正做到全面地照顾国家、合作社、社员三方面的利益。
    分配给社员的部分，也有不少问题需要注意解决。第一，是穷村与富村之间的矛盾。有些社规模大，各队（村）之间经济条件悬殊，矛盾很尖锐。去年曾经发生各队集体隐瞒产量、集体抢夺粮食的事情。防止这类事情的一个比较好的办法，是在包产指标上对富村加以照顾，使它比穷村能够得到较多的超产奖励。还可以把一部分适合生产队经营的副业，以及一部分森林、果树、荒地等包给生产队去经营，使经济条件较好的生产队得到较多的收入。另外，也有这样的情况：有些社由于包定的农活数量相差悬殊，或其他原因，使各队所做的工分相差很大。这个问题也应该找出原因，加以合理的解决。
    第二，是超支户和分空户的问题。这问题必须在夏收分配中适当解决。对于超支户的处理，应该具体分析，按照各个户的不同情况分别进行安排，帮助他们在社里多出工，帮助他们安排家庭副业和家庭生活。同时要向他们分别提出偿还超支款的要求。有些户不能在夏收分配期间全部偿还，也应该帮助他们订出分期偿还的计划。同超支款问题有联系的是“分空户”的问题。这主要是那些劳动力多而又勤劳的社员，他们对合作社拖欠他们应得的收入是不满意的。在夏收分配当中，合作社应该积极清偿这部分债款。一时不能全数归还的，也应该作出计划，定期偿还，决不能无故拖延。
    第三，是社干部的待遇问题。今年社干部一般都参加了生产劳动，有些社对社干部的待遇实行“定工生产、定额补助、年终评奖”的办法，社员和干部都满意。但是还有一些社在干部参加生产劳动以后，没有相应地规定干部补贴的办法，这就需要在夏收分配当中来解决。此外，对于五保户和手工业户、渔业户、商贩等，在夏收分配中也应该适当地加以安排。
    粮食的分配，应当按照国家规定的原则执行：凡是余粮社，都要首先完成国家征购任务，然后进行社内分配。在保证全社所必需的口粮、饲料、种子以后，如果还有余粮，可以分给那些多做了工分的社员。去年有些社的作法不完全符合这个原则。有的完全按劳动工分分粮，以致造成社员收入悬殊，一部分人粮食吃不了，一部分人粮食不够吃。有的社完全按人口平均分粮，而工分做得少的人又没有抵偿多分了的粮食价款，变成了超支户，于是工分做得多的人有的吃了亏。今年应当避免这样的毛病。各个余粮社都应该做到：既保证全体社员的必需口粮，又照顾到工分做得多的那部分社员的需要。有一部分劳动所得较少的社员，一时没有力量买回他们应得的全部口粮，这部分粮食，应该由农业合作社作为周转粮处理。
    今年春季以来，广大社员都渴望知道并监督合作社的财务收支，要求通过充分讨论来决定有关收益分配的各种重要问题。因此这次夏收分配将是对于每一个农业社执行民主办社方针的一次重大考验。每一个社的领导干部都应该切实重视社员群众的在经济上当家做主的权利，在准备和进行夏收分配的过程中充分发扬民主，在各种问题上多同群众商量。同时还要认识，收益分配关系到各个方面，各种人的利益。它所要解决的问题是这样错综复杂，如果不充分发挥社员群众的集体智慧，而单凭少数社干部关门分配，那是无论如何也做不好的。
    各地领导机关和农业合作社还应当注意，不要把自己的努力仅限于分配夏季收益，还应该抓住分配中所暴露的各种问题，认真分析研究，找出解决办法，把下半年的生产和财务工作搞得更好。
    夏收分配的时候，正是晚秋作物播种和夏季田间管理的农忙季节。因此，应该注意把夏收分配工作同当前的生产密切结合起来，防止因为算账、分粮而放松生产的现象发生。
