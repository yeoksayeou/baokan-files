　　Kishi Nobusuke Goes to Play Golf
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
    Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi set off for the United States for a visit. The Japanese ruling clique attaches great importance to this visit and has made many preparations in advance. Dulles recently also said that this US-Japan meeting is "a very important meeting at an important moment."

    It seems to have become a convention that the Japanese Prime Minister must go to the United States to "seek advice." What kind of "advice" is Kishi Nobusuke going to the United States to seek this time? According to Kishi Nobusuke himself, his task is to "strive to reach a common understanding with the United States on basic US-Japan relations." Since the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet came to power, the rule of the Japanese conservative forces has finally been temporarily stabilized. This reflects the rapid recovery and strengthening of Japanese monopoly capital in recent years. In order to consolidate this rule, Japanese monopoly capital believes that it is necessary to adjust the relationship between Japan and the United States, that is, to so-called "establish a new cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States."

    In the talks that Kishi Nobusuke is about to hold with the United States, it is said that the issue of revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" will be the center of the US-Japan negotiations. However, on this issue, the ruling groups of the United States and Japan actually have no major differences. The United States is asking Japan to step up rearmament, and the Japanese ruling group is happy to do so. The reason why Kishi Nobusuke is raising this issue is that the Japanese people's movement for independence and for the abolition of the unequal US-Japan treaty is rising, the democratic forces are constantly strengthening, and the influence of the conservative party is gradually declining. In order to consolidate the rule of the conservative party, the Japanese ruling group cannot but make some gestures on the issue of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." They believe that after doing so, they can further put forward the demand to amend the constitution under the slogan of "building their own defense forces," implement stepped-up rearmament, and crack down on domestic peace and democratic forces. This is where Kishi Nobusuke needs to ask the United States for "understanding" and "hope that the United States will not misunderstand."

    However, Kishi Nobusuke's real purpose is to use the strengthening of US-Japan relations and stepped-up rearmament as capital to ask the United States for money. At present, Japanese monopoly capital has recovered its vitality, and its production level has exceeded that before the war. However, due to the loss of colonies like before the war, that is, the loss of stable markets and sources of raw materials, Japanese monopoly capital has encountered insurmountable difficulties in competing with other capitalist powers for consolidation and development. Since the beginning of this year, Japan's international balance of payments deficit has increased and its dollar reserves have declined, putting Japan's economic prosperity at risk of collapse. Therefore, Japanese monopoly capital is eager to combine with the United States' plan to "develop" Southeast Asia, using American capital, Southeast Asian markets and resources, to open up a way out for itself. The reason given by Japanese monopoly capital to the United States is that it is necessary to stabilize Japan's economic power first, and then stabilize its political power, and that these two are the foundation for enriching military power. This is what Kishi Nobusuke really needs to ask the United States to "understand."

    From the United States' point of view, it is eager to send nuclear-powered mobile units to Japan and Okinawa, and to provide Japan with missiles to arm Japan, in order to push Japan into the ranks of the United States' nuclear strategy system. The United States sees that it has already fattened Japanese monopoly capital and believes that it is time for Japan to spend more money on rearmament. The US authorities have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the speed of Japan's rearmament, wanting to find out what Japan intends to do and wanting Japan to show its cards. Therefore, whether the United States will allow the US-Japan "Security" Treaty to be revised, making Japan run the risk of independence on the issue of rearmament, is still a question. On the other hand, due to the rising sentiment of the Southeast Asian people against American colonialism, especially after the anti-American demonstrations by the people of Taiwan, the United States feels deeply that it is not popular in Asia, and also wants to use Japan to play a supporting role in American colonial policy. The US State Department authorities believe that "Japan's use of its position as a member of the Asian-African group to actively approach Southeast Asia, which has strong anti-Western European sentiments and strong national characteristics, will play a major role in bridging the gap between Western European and Asian-African countries." However, whether the United States is willing to let Japanese monopoly capital use American money to expand its own power in Asia, making American monopoly capital suffer losses, is also a question. The *New York Times* has long said, "If the Japanese hope that Kishi Nobusuke can take many 'concessions' out of his briefcase when he returns from his visit to the United States, then they must be disappointed."

    In order to "ask for money" from the United States, Kishi Nobusuke prepared a large amount of political capital. A few days ago, he went to Southeast Asia for a drill under the banner of "US-Japan friendship and cooperation." He publicized the benefits of American aid everywhere and expressed Japan's sincerity in developing Southeast Asia. In order to win the favor of the United States, he said a lot of bad things about China and even made a special trip to Taiwan. After Britain decided to relax its embargo on China, Japan also kept a hand in the issue of trade with China, deliberately creating obstacles as capital for bargaining in Washington. In order to express its willingness to cooperate with the US nuclear strategy, Kishi Nobusuke even declared in the Japanese House of Councillors: "Possessing nuclear weapons within the scope of self-defense does not violate the constitution." Kyodo News commented on this: "Kishi's remarks will undoubtedly win the praise of the United States, but they make the Japanese people feel very uneasy."

    Now, Kishi Nobusuke has rushed to Washington with great excitement. It is said that Eisenhower is waiting there to play golf with him! However, it remains to be seen whose golf skills are better.

### 岸信介打高尔夫球去了

　　岸信介打高尔夫球去了
　　本报评论员
    昨天，日本首相岸信介动身去美国进行访问了。日本统治集团非常重视这次访问，事先做了许多准备工作。而杜勒斯最近也说，这次日美会谈“是在一个重要的时刻的一个非常重要的会见”。
    日本首相必须到美国去“取经”，这似乎已经成为惯例了。这一次，岸信介到美国去取什么“经”呢？据岸信介自己说，他的任务是要“努力和美国在基本的美日关系上达成共同谅解”。从岸信介内阁上台以来，日本保守势力的统治，总算暂时得到了稳定。这反映了日本垄断资本近年来的迅速恢复和加强。日本垄断资本为了巩固这一统治，认为有必要调整日美两国之间的关系，也就是所谓“建立日美两国之间的新的合作关系”。
    在岸信介将要同美国举行的会谈中，据说所谓修改日美“安全条约”问题，将是日美谈判的中心。可是，在这个问题上，日美两国统治集团实际上并没有很大的分歧。美国要求日本加紧重新武装，日本统治集团也乐于这样做。岸信介之所以要托出这个问题，是因为日本人民要求独立、要求废除日美不平等条约的运动日益高涨，民主势力不断增强，保守党的影响逐渐下降。日本统治集团为了巩固保守党的统治，就不能不在日美“安全条约”的问题上做一些姿态。它们以为在这样做了以后，就可以在“建立自己的国防力量”的口号下，进一步提出修改宪法的要求，实行加紧重新武装，打击国内的和平民主力量。这是岸信介需要请美国“谅解”、“希望美国方面不要发生误会”的地方。
    但是，岸信介的真正目的，却是要以加强日美关系，加紧重新武装为资本，向美国伸手要钱。目前，日本垄断资本已经恢复了元气，生产水平已经超过战前。但是，由于丧失了像战前那样的殖民地，也就是丧失了稳定的市场和原料来源地，日本垄断资本要想和其他资本主义强国竞争以求巩固和发展，就遇到了难以克服的困难。今年以来，日本国际收支赤字增加，美元储备下降，使日本经济上的繁荣景象面临着破灭的危机。因此，日本垄断资本急于想和美国“开发”东南亚的计划结合起来，利用美国的资本、东南亚的市场和资源，为它自己打开一条出路。日本垄断资本向美国提出的理由是：首先要稳定日本的经济力量，然后才能稳定政治力量，而这两者是充实军事力量的基础。这就是岸信介真正需要请美国“谅解”的事情。
    从美国方面说来，它急于派遣原子机动部队到日本和冲绳，向日本提供导弹来武装日本，以便把日本推到美国原子战略体制的行列之中。美国眼看着已经把日本垄断资本喂肥，认为现在是日本多拿出一些钱来进行重新武装的时候了。美国当局曾经多次对日本重新武装的速度表示不满，要弄清楚日本究竟打算怎么办，要日本摊牌。因此，美国是不是容许修改日美“安全”条约，使日本在重新武装的问题上有闹独立性的危险，还是个问题。另一方面，由于东南亚人民反对美国殖民主义的情绪日益高涨，特别在台湾人民反美大示威以后，美国深感自己在亚洲吃不开，也想利用日本为美国殖民政策跑龙套。美国国务院当局认为，“日本利用它本身也是亚非集团的一个成员的地位，积极地接近具有强烈的反西欧情绪和浓厚的民族色彩的东南亚，对填平西欧和亚非国家之间的鸿沟会起很大作用”。但是，美国是不是愿意让日本垄断资本用美国的钱在亚洲扩张自己的势力，使美国垄断资本吃亏，这也还是一个问题。“纽约时报”早就说过，“如果日本人希望岸信介访美回国时能从他的皮包里取出许多‘让步’，那末一定要感到失望的。”
    岸信介为了向美国“要钱”，准备了一大笔政治资本。前些日子，他打着“日美亲善合作”的旗子，到东南亚作了一番演习。他到处宣扬美援的好处，表白日本对开发东南亚的诚心。为了取得美国的欢心，他说了中国不少坏话，还特地到台湾跑了一趟。在英国决定放宽对华禁运之后，日本在对华贸易问题上也留了一手，故意制造障碍，作为在华盛顿讨价还价的资本。为了表示愿意同美国的原子战略合作，岸信介甚至在日本参议院宣称：“在自卫的范围内拥有原子武器，是不违反宪法的”。日本共同社对此发表评论说：“岸的谈话无疑会博得美国的称赞，但他却使日本国民感到很不安”。
    现在，岸信介已经兴冲冲地奔向华盛顿了。据说在那里艾森豪威尔等着同他打高尔夫球哩！可是，究竟谁的球技高明，却还有待分晓。
