　　Beijing News -- The enlarged symposium of the Central Committee Small Group of the China Democratic League held on June 25th exposed Luo Longji's words and actions against the leadership of the Party and revealed his so-called "invisible" clique. Before the meeting concluded, Luo Longji expressed his desire to examine his thinking and confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun. However, his speech mainly defended his own mistakes. He even said that even if his bones were burned to ashes, no anti-socialist intentions could be found. This aroused great revulsion among everyone. Sa Kongliao pointed out: Eloquence and endless arguments are Luo Longji's old tricks of decades. Min Ganghou and Hu Yuzhi requested that the next meeting begin with Luo Longji confessing his anti-socialist words and deeds.

　　Most of the speakers at today's meeting drew a clear line between themselves and Luo Longji politically; however, some people's positions were still ambiguous.

　　Prior to the symposium, an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League was held, which adopted supplementary instructions on the rectification movement within the League. Based on the new situation of the progress of the rectification movement within the League, the meeting decided that League organizations across the country could conduct rectification simultaneously. At the current stage, the main content of the rectification within the League is to examine and correct the political direction and political stance of the League's leadership at all levels, and to criticize and expose the words and actions of right-wing elements within the League.

　　Chen Dingwen said:

　　Luo said accepting the leadership of the Party committees at the same level would "bisect" the China Democratic League

　　Chen Dingwen said in his speech that, with a few exceptions, almost all League members who knew or slightly knew Luo Longji said he was a rightist. He has always been socialist in words, capitalist in mind, and sometimes capitalist in words, so the title of "rightist" is well-known among the people.

　　He said that Luo Longji's opposition to accepting the leadership of the Party has been consistent. In 1948, the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the League pointed out that it would always follow the Communist Party, but Luo disagreed with this. Luo Longji's remarks of not accepting the leadership of the Party did not stop after he arrived in Beijing after liberation. Wu Han, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, proposed that the League's organization should be led by the Party committee at the same level. The Central Committee of the League agreed, but Luo Longji disagreed, saying, "This is bisecting the China Democratic League." Luo Longji saw some League members joining the Party as if they were thorns in his back, and he even proposed that all Communist Party members within the League should withdraw from the League. One of his top aides, Zhao Wenbi (working in the Ministry of Forestry), still implements his proposal, excluding the two League members who have joined the Party in the Ministry of Forestry branch.

　　He also said that Luo Longji used corrupt bourgeois methods to campaign in the elections of 1951-1953. In order to get Chen Xingui elected, Luo Longji did not hesitate to treat guests at Tsinghua University. Luo also wooed the staff of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, inviting us to dinner, saying, "If we seize Beijing, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League will have strength." This is a manifestation of Luo Longji's personal political ambitions.

　　Fei Xiaotong said:

　　Luo Longji believes that the distance between intellectuals and the Party is caused by ideological remolding.

　　Fei Xiaotong said that some of his thoughts were consistent with Luo Longji's, while others were different. He said that Luo Longji always looked for him, Wu Jingchao, and Pan Guangdan to talk when writing his speeches. Luo Longji believed that "decent" intellectuals were those who retained bourgeois ideas, and all those who were progressive were called "dogmatists" by him. He said that Deng Chumin was the most prominent "dogmatist." Luo Longji hated progressive elements the most, believing that they were people who "watched the wind, observed the climate, labeled others, and hit people when they were down." He believed that those who were ideologically backward were capable. He told them: "There is no need to underestimate your past work and achievements," do not be "unduly humble," and let them "use their own skills and show their talents." Fei Xiaotong said that the skills Luo Longji referred to were actually the set dominated by bourgeois ideology.

　　Fei Xiaotong pointed out that Luo Longji had always hated ideological remolding in recent years, saying that intellectuals did not like this term. Luo Longji believed that the distance between intellectuals and the Party was caused by the ideological remolding movement. Ideological remolding and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were the reasons for the estrangement between the Party and non-Party members, so he demanded that the Party treat intellectuals as "national scholars." If they did not, they would not be willing to exert their strength.

　　Fei Xiaotong said that Luo Longji seized the "Contending" publication of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the League and occupied it for his own use, attempting to turn this publication into an anti-socialist publication.

　　Pan Dakui said:

　　Luo Longji has a so-called "invisible" organization.

　　Pan Dakui admitted that he had always been considered a firm implementer of Luo Longji's opinions and a member of Luo Longji's small faction. He expressed his desire to draw a line with Luo Longji and firmly follow the Communist Party. He said that Luo Longji had always influenced him with the bourgeois selfish and profit-seeking viewpoint. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League once intended to transfer him to Beijing to work, but he was hesitant at the time. At this time, Luo Longji said to him: If you come to work in the Central Committee, you are just an ordinary cadre, at most a deputy minister; while in the local area, you are a leader. As a result, he did not come to work in Beijing. He said that after the national liberation, Luo Longji had an "invisible" small organization or small faction, with about ten people, including Zhang Dongsun, Liu Wang Liming, Zhou Jingwen, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Wu Jingchao, Ye Duyi, Fei Xiaotong, Fan Puzhai, and Zhang Zhihe. These people were all dissatisfied with the arrangements for work and status after liberation. He believed that there were actually factions within the China Democratic League. The reason why Luo Longji did not let me come to work in Beijing was to let me set up a base in Sichuan and use local forces to support him. Pan Dakui attempted to explain that this so-called "invisible" organization had ceased to exist in the past two years, but he also admitted that there were still contacts between individuals. When he came to Beijing to attend meetings, Luo Longji still talked to him.

　　He said that Luo Longji once said to him that the democratic parties had no future, but after the Central Committee of the Communist Party proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Luo Longji immediately became active, and like Zhang Bojun, advocated that the China Democratic League should develop greatly, because the democratic parties would have a great role to play in the future. He said that Luo Longji had repeatedly blamed him for the fact that the organization of the China Democratic League in Sichuan Province had developed too little. Luo Longji also said to him that although bourgeois democracy has shortcomings, it also has its advantages; although the proletarian dictatorship also has advantages, it always feels that something is lacking. He wanted to win over a group of great intellectuals as his political capital, and he had the ambition to be a leader. Pan Dakui also admitted that he and Luo Longji both advocated taking the middle road. During the Kunming period, they once engaged in a political program that advocated learning from the United Kingdom and the United States in politics and from the Soviet Union in economics, which was a patchwork.

　　Peng Dixian said:

　　Demanding that Pan Dakui further confess the activities of the small group

　　Peng Dixian said that Pan Dakui's speech today expressed his desire to draw a line with Luo Longji, and this should be welcomed. However, there are still many issues that he has not discussed, and we must continue to help him.

　　Peng Dixian did not believe that their small group no longer existed after Luo Longji became the vice chairman of the China Democratic League and the Minister of Forestry. He said that this was strange. Why did the small group disappear when Luo Longji's activities became more and more intense? He asked Pan Dakui to confess further.

　　He said that Luo once said at the first meeting of the National People's Congress that when the Communist Party came, there was no law. This sentence was deleted when it was published in the People's Daily; however, Luo Longji did say this sentence. His hostile emotions towards the Party were unconsciously revealed.

　　Luo Longji often talked about the issue of intellectuals at the CPPCC meetings, not to help intellectuals from a positive perspective and strengthen ideological remolding, but to say words that catered to the backward consciousness of intellectuals, such as "A scholar dies for his confidant," and "Three visits to the thatched cottage."

　　When Luo Longji went to Sichuan for inspection, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China asked him to give his opinions. He did not talk about them in person, but brought back a batch of letters as the basis for establishing a "Rehabilitation Committee." As a leader of the League, this approach is very bad.

　　Peng Dixian said: Pan Dakui once said: Luo Longji had read Chu Anping's speech, but why did he not confess?

　　Ye Duyi exposed the ambiguous relationship between Luo Longji and Situ Leideng and the Kuomintang before and after liberation.

　　Ye Duyi exposed a series of reactionary remarks by Luo Longji. He said that in 1936 and 1937, when the anti-Japanese movement was surging, Luo Longji ran the Tianjin Yishibao and the Beijing Chenbao. He actually advocated: talking about anti-Chiang in the north and talking about anti-Japanese in the south. Talking about anti-Chiang in the north was actually helping Japan to engage in the specialisation of North China. At that time, he also took money from the Japanese to set up a research institute in Tianjin. In 1946-1947, Chiang Kai-shek hit and pulled the China Democratic League. Chiang Kai-shek hit the National Salvation Association and pulled Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun. It was Lei Zhen who pulled Luo Longji. At the end of 1947, the China Democratic League was forced to disband. Luo Longji was living in the Hongqiao Sanatorium at this time, nominally under house arrest, but in reality, the monthly hospitalisation fee of a certain amount of gold was paid by Lei Zhen. Luo Longji was very free at the time and could go out to see friends and buy things at will, but he repeatedly refused the underground party's invitation for him to go to the liberated areas. When Jinan was liberated, Luo Longji talked to the US ambassador Situ Leideng. He said that the United States had bought the wrong horse. If one-tenth of the money given to Chiang Kai-shek was given to the China Democratic League, it would be much better. At the end of 1948, Wu Han went to the liberated areas via Shanghai. Luo Longji asked him to take a letter to Shen Junru and others who were already in the liberated areas, and to negotiate conditions with the Party, asking the Party to adopt a collaborative foreign policy instead of leaning to one side, otherwise the China Democratic League would retreat to being an opposition party. After arriving in Beijing in 1949, he and Zhang Dongsun met the US Consul General in Beijing at Zhang Zongbing's home. Luo Longji said that Situ Leideng had asked him to tell Premier Zhou that if he did not lean to one side, he could give billions of US dollars in aid. He asked the US Consul General to tell Situ Leideng that this did not need to be conveyed. Ye Duyi said: Since it was not to be conveyed, what was the need to ask the US Consul General to tell Situ Leideng? What else was there besides these that was to be conveyed to Situ Leideng? At the end of 1949, the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League reviewed the past mistakes. He thought it was a blow to him. Later, he organised a small faction and told people how the United Front Work Department treated us, depending on how much capital we had. What other explanation is there for this statement other than resisting the leadership of the Party? After 1952, Luo Longji and I became estranged. He said that someone had warned him that I often went to the United Front Work Department to report on him and asked him to be careful. Ye Duyi said that the door of the United Front Work Department was wide open, and there was no need for any small reports. Luo Longji should explain who warned him, and why he should be careful? Ye Duyi also revealed that Luo Longji had told Xu Zhucheng, the editor-in-chief of Wenhui Daily, not to listen to the party group of Wenhui Daily and to reflect on things in Beijing. Luo Longji also entertained guests at home for Wenhui Daily several times and instructed Yan Baoli, the deputy editor-in-chief of Wenhui Daily, on how to do things. Ye Duyi questioned what the relationship between Luo Longji and Wenhui Daily was.

　　Hu Yuzhi talked about a letter from Luo Longji

　　Luo claimed that he only knew how to fight in his life. What did he fight for and against whom?

　　Hu Yuzhi said in his speech: Recently, someone from Sichuan came and talked about this matter: Wu Hanjia from the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League revealed: In the summer of 1951, Fan Puzhai brought Luo Longji's letter to him. The letter said: Fan Puzhai should go to Chongqing to help Pan Dakui. The letter also said: "Your brother has no other strengths in his life, only knows how to fight to the end." Hu Yuzhi said: This sentence is worth studying. I don't know who he is going to fight to the end with, and what is the purpose of the fight.

　　Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, and Tong Dizhou jointly stated: "We were also used by right-wing elements once."

　　Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, and Tong Dizhou said in a joint statement entitled "We were also used by right-wing elements once" that in mid-May this year, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, without discussion and approval by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, decided through a few people to establish four working groups: "Party Committee System of Universities and Colleges," "Scientific Planning," "Authority with Responsibility," and "Long-term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision." Among them, the Scientific Planning Group was designated to be responsible by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, Tong Dizhou, and Qian Weichang. They said that at that time, their political vigilance was not enough, and they did not suspect that there were any conspiracies in it, so they agreed. Later, this group held several meetings and drafted "Several Opinions on the Issue of China's Scientific System," but because of work and illness, they did not fully participate in the meetings, especially the document revised by Fei Xiaotong (who was not in the five-person group) was sent away without soliciting everyone's opinions. It was not until the Guangming Daily published this document that they realized that some of the statements in it had committed fundamental errors. The main errors were: to "restore" and "attach importance to" bourgeois social sciences, while the words "restore" and "attach importance to" were not in the original manuscript, but were added by someone at the end; emphasizing that "the people should be treated equally in terms of cultivation opportunities, and young people with promising cultivation prospects should be treated equally," as if the state had not treated the cultivation of new forces equally or equally in the past, which is not in line with the facts; the statement of "protecting scientists" is also inappropriate, as if it means that the Party and the government do not protect scientists, which is also not in line with the facts.

　　Pu Xixiu defended Luo Longji, insisting that Luo Longji had nothing to do with Wenhui Daily.

　　Pu Xixiu defended Luo Longji at the meeting. She said that Luo Longji had not talked to her about any issues after returning from abroad. Pu Xixiu insisted that Luo Longji had nothing to do with Wenhui Daily. But she also admitted that only once at Luo Longji's home did she invite people from various democratic parties to eat and talk about how Wenhui Daily should work and solicit opinions widely. Regarding Ye Duyi's revelation that Luo Longji did not allow listening to the Wenhui Daily party group and to reflect on things in Beijing, Pu Xixiu made this defence for Luo Longji: she understood that Luo Longji meant that the level of party members was low, and Luo Longji knew more.

　　Luo Longji said that if he had any anti-socialist conspiracy, he was willing to be punished by national law and the League's charter.

　　After everyone exposed and criticised him, Luo Longji made a brief speech. He said that he had not gone through the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements. This movement is helpful to the China Democratic League and can eliminate all anti-socialist ideas, which is also good for the country. Therefore, he expressed his sincere welcome to this movement. He expressed his desire to make a deep reflection. On the one hand, he said: "I have never said in the China Democratic League that my thinking is progressive." But then he said that even if his bones were burned to ashes, he had no intention or conspiracy to oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party. If it is found out, he is willing to be punished by national law and the League's charter.

　　Luo Longji said that he did not indeed read Chu Anping's speech at the United Front Work Department symposium. He said that he did not read it beforehand, nor did he read it afterwards, until he returned to China this time. He said that he had called Zhang Bojun about this matter, but Zhang Bojun was vague. He believed that Zhang Bojun should be responsible for this issue. Then, he said, why did Zhang Bojun not say that others had read Chu Anping's speech, but insisted on saying that I had? Many people in society also believe this, which is what I should examine.

　　Luo Longji made a nominal defence on the issue of the "Rehabilitation Committee" he had proposed. He said: I have not used the term "Rehabilitation Committee." What I said was to form a "committee" jointly by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the CPPCC, and various democratic parties. This committee has three functions, one of which is the rehabilitation function, and the leading party must also participate. He also said that these words were wrong, and he did not deny it. According to him, the reason why he said such words was because he did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions.

　　Luo Longji said: "Recently, some people often mention Zhang and Luo together. I don't want this. I am responsible for my own words and actions." But he also said that he would confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun.

　　Wu Jingchao, Wu Han, Nie Guoqing, Liu Qingyang, and Qian Duansheng also spoke at the meeting.

### 民盟中央小组扩大座谈会  集中揭露罗隆基的右派真面目  罗隆基说要检查自己，但对揭发的重要事实坚决抵赖

　　民盟中央小组扩大座谈会
    集中揭露罗隆基的右派真面目
    罗隆基说要检查自己，但对揭发的重要事实坚决抵赖
    本报讯  6月25日举行的民盟中央小组扩大座谈会，揭露了罗隆基反对党的领导的言论和行动，揭露了他的所谓“无形的”小集团，会议结束前，罗隆基表示要检查思想，交代同章伯钧的关系；但是他的发言主要是为自己的错误辩解。他甚至还说，把他的骨头烧成灰，也找不出反社会主义的意图。这激起了大家的极大的反感。萨空了指出：花言巧语，无休止的争辩，是罗隆基几十年来的老办法。闵刚侯、胡愈之要求下次会议首先由罗隆基交代他的反社会主义的言论和活动。
    今天会上发言的人，多数同罗隆基在政治上划清了界限；但有些人的立场还是模糊不清的。
    在座谈会以前，举行了民盟中央常委扩大会议，曾通过了关于盟内整风运动的补充指示。根据盟内整风进展的新的情势，会议决定全国各地盟组织可以同时进行整风。在目前阶段，盟内整风的主要内容，是检查和端正盟的各级领导的政治方向和政治立场，批判和揭露盟内右派分子的言论行动。
　　陈鼎文说：
    罗说接受同级党委的领导是腰斩民盟
    陈鼎文在发言中说，除少数例外，只要认识或略为知道罗隆基这个人的盟员，几乎都说他是右派。他一贯是口头上是社会主义，脑子里是资本主义，有时口头上也来点资本主义，于是“右派”这个称呼就在人群中有口皆碑。
    他说，罗隆基反对接受党的领导是一贯的。在1948年，盟的三中全会决议中指出永远跟着共产党走，罗对这一点就表示不同意。罗隆基在解放后到北京，不接受党的领导的言论仍未停止。民盟北京市委员会主任委员吴晗提出：盟的组织应受同级党委的领导，盟中央是同意的，但是罗隆基不同意，说“这是腰斩民盟”。罗隆基看到盟员中有人入党，犹如芒刺在背，他竟提出要盟内的共产党员都退盟。他的大员之一赵文璧（在森林工业部工作）直到现在仍然执行他的主张，排斥森林工业部支部两位入党的盟员。
    他还说，罗隆基在1951—1953年的选举中，曾用陈腐的资产阶级的方式来竞选。罗隆基为了使陈新桂当选，竟不惜到清华大学去请客。罗还拉拢民盟北京市委员会的工作人员，请我们吃饭，说什么“抓住了北京市，民盟中央就有力量了”。这就是罗隆基的个人政治野心的表现。
　　费孝通说：
    罗隆基认为知识分子和党的距离是思想改造搞出来的
    费孝通说，他的有些思想和罗隆基是一致的，有些则不同。他说，罗隆基写发言稿时，老是找他、吴景超、潘光旦一起谈。罗隆基认为“正派”的知识分子是保留着资产阶级思想的那些人，凡是进步的都被他称为“教条主义者”，他说，邓初民就是“教条主义”最突出的一个。罗隆基最讨厌进步分子，认为他们是“观风色，看气候，扣帽子，打冷拳”的人物。他认为那些思想落后的人是有本事的。他要他们：“不必低估自己以往的工作和成绩”，不要“妄自菲薄”，要他们“各凭本事，各显神通”。费孝通说，罗隆基所指的本事实际上就是受资产阶级思想所支配的那一套。
    费孝通指出，罗隆基这几年来一直讨厌思想改造，说知识分子不喜欢这个名词。罗隆基认为知识分子和党的距离是思想改造运动搞出来的。思想改造和肃反是造成党和非党隔膜的原因，所以他要求党以“国士”对待知识分子，不这样，他们就不肯把力量发挥出来。
    费孝通说罗隆基把盟北京市委的“争鸣”刊物夺过来据为己有，企图把这个刊物变成反社会主义的刊物。
　　潘大逵说：
    罗隆基有一个所谓“无形的”组织
    潘大逵承认他一向被认为是罗隆基意见的坚决执行者，是罗隆基小宗派中的一分子。他表示要和罗隆基划清界限，坚决跟着共产党走。他说，罗隆基一直用资产阶级自私自利的名利观点来影响他，民盟中央曾经打算调他到北京来工作，当时他很犹豫。这时罗隆基就对他说：你到中央来工作，只是一个普通干部，最多是一个副部长；而在地方上则是一个领导人。这样，他就没有到北京来工作。他说，全国解放以后，罗隆基有一个“无形的”小组织或者小宗派，大约有十个人左右，其中有张东荪、刘王立明、周鲸文、曾昭抡、潘光旦、吴景超、叶笃义、费孝通、范朴斋、张志和等。这些人都是解放后对工作和地位的安排不满意的。他认为，民盟内部实际上有宗派，罗隆基所以不让我来北京工作，就是想让我在四川安个点，用地方的力量来支持他。潘大逵一方面企图说明近两年来这个所谓“无形的”的组织已经不存在，另一方面他又承认个别人之间也仍然有往来，他到北京来开会时，罗隆基还是找他谈话。
    他说，罗隆基曾经对他说过，民主党派没有什么搞头，但是中共中央提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针以后，罗隆基立即积极起来，同章伯钧一样主张民盟组织应当大发展，因为今后民主党派大有作为。他说，罗隆基几次责备他，认为民盟四川省的组织发展得太少。罗隆基还对他说过，资产阶级的民主虽然有缺点，但是也还有它的优点；无产阶级专政固然也有优点，但总觉得缺乏一点什么东西。他想拉拢一批大知识分子作他的政治资本，他有当领袖的野心。潘大逵还承认，他和罗隆基都是主张走中间路线的，在昆明时期就曾经搞过一个政纲，主张在政治上学英美，在经济上学苏联，是一个杂凑起来的东西。
　　彭迪先说：
    要求潘大逵进一步交代小集团活动
    彭迪先说，潘大逵今天的发言表示要同罗隆基划清界限，就这一点说，是应当表示欢迎的。但是，还有许多问题他没有谈，我们要继续帮助他。
    彭迪先不相信在罗隆基当了民盟副主席、森林工业部部长以后，他们的小集团就不存在了。他说，这是奇怪的。为什么在罗隆基的活动越来越紧张的时候，反而没有了小集团呢？他要求潘大逵进一步交代。
    他说，罗曾经在人大第一次会议上说，共产党来了，有法无天。人民日报上发表的时候删去了这句话；但罗隆基确实说过这句话。他对党的敌对情绪不知不觉地流露出来了。
    罗隆基在政协会议上常常谈知识分子问题，不是从正面帮助知识分子，加强思想改造，而是讲迎合知识分子落后意识的话，什么“士为知己者死”，“三顾茅庐”。
    罗隆基到四川视察，中共省委请他提意见，他当面不谈，带回一批信来，作为成立什么“平反委员会”的根据。作为盟的领导人，这种作法是很不好的。
    彭迪先说：潘大逵曾说过：储安平的发言，罗隆基看过的，但他为什么不交代？
　　叶笃义揭发罗隆基解放前后和司徒雷登、国民党之间的暧昧关系
    叶笃义揭发了罗隆基一系列的反动言论。他说1936、1937年正是抗日运动风起云涌的时候，罗隆基办天津益世报和北京晨报，他竟然主张：在北方谈反蒋，在南方谈抗日。在北方谈反蒋实际就是帮助日本搞华北特殊化。当时，他还拿日本人的钱在天津搞了一个研究所。1946——1947年时，蒋介石对民盟是一打一拉。蒋介石打的是救国会，拉的是罗隆基、张东荪。拉罗隆基的是雷震。1947年底民盟被迫解散，罗隆基这时住在虹桥疗养院，名为软禁，实际上每月多少两金子的住院费都是由雷震代付的。罗隆基当时行动很自由，可以随便出去看朋友、买东西，但几次拒绝地下党请他到解放区去的约请。济南解放时，罗隆基找美国大使司徒雷登谈话，他说，美国买马买错了，如果把给蒋介石的钱的十分之一拿给民盟会要好得多。1948年底，吴晗经上海到解放区，罗隆基托他带信给已在解放区的沈钧儒等，跟党讲条件，要党采取协和外交政策，而不要一边倒，否则民盟将退居为在野党。1949年到北京后，他同张东荪在张宗炳家会见美国驻北京的总领事，罗隆基说司徒雷登曾托他转告周总理如果不一边倒，可以给几十亿美元的援助。他托美国总领事转告司徒雷登，说这话不必转达了。叶笃义说：既然不转达，有什么必要还要请美总领事转告司徒雷登？要转告给司徒雷登的，除了这些，还有什么内容？1949年底，民盟四中全会检查过去的错误路线，他认为是对他的打击。以后，他组织小宗派，向人说统战部如何对待我们，就看我们有多少本钱。这种说法除了抵抗党的领导而外，还有什么其他的解释。1952年后，罗隆基和我疏远了，他说有人警告他，说我经常到统战部打小报告，要他提防。叶笃义说，统战部的门是大开的，不需要什么小报告，罗隆基应该说明，警告他的是谁，他为什么要提防？叶笃义还揭露，罗隆基曾告诉文汇报社长徐铸成，要他不要听文汇报党组的话，有事情到北京来反映。罗隆基还在家为文汇报请过几次客，训示文汇报副社长阎宝礼要如何如何做。叶笃义质问罗隆基究竟与文汇报是什么关系？
　　胡愈之谈到罗隆基的一封信
    罗自称一生唯知斗争  他究竟斗争什么向谁斗争
    胡愈之在发言中说：最近四川有人来，谈到这样一件事：民盟成都市委吴汉家揭发：1951年夏，范朴斋带罗隆基的信给他，信上说：要范朴斋去重庆助潘大逵一臂之力。信上还说：“弟一生别无他长，唯知斗争到底而已。”胡愈之说：这句话值得研究，不知他究竟要和谁斗争到底，斗争的目的是什么。
　　千家驹、华罗庚、童第周联合发言：“我们也被右派分子利用了一次”
    千家驹、华罗庚和童第周在题为“我们也被右派分子利用了一次”的联合发言中说，今年5月中旬，章伯钧、罗隆基没有经过民盟中常会讨论通过，就由少数人决定成立“高等学校党委制”、“科学规划”、“有职有权”、“长期共存、互相监督”四个工作组，其中科学规划小组，指定由曾昭抡、千家驹、华罗庚、童第周、钱伟长五人负责。他们说，当时他们的政治警惕性不够，未怀疑其中有任何阴谋活动，就答应了。以后这个小组开过几次会，起草了一个“有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，而他们因事因病没有完全参加会议，特别是最后由费孝通（他不在五人小组之内）修改过的文件没有征求大家的意见就送走了。直到光明日报把这个文件发表以后，他们才知道其中有些问题的提法犯了原则性的错误。主要的错误有：要“恢复”和“重视”资产阶级的社会科学，而“恢复”和“重视”的话在原稿中是没有的，是有人最后加进去的；强调“人民内部在培养机会上应一视同仁，对于有培养前途的青年都应当平等地看待”，这好像说国家过去对培养新生力量不是一视同仁，或者不是平等地看待似的，这不符合事实；“保护科学家”的提法也不妥当，意思好像是说党和政府不保护科学家，这也不符合事实。
　　浦熙修替罗隆基辩解  硬说罗隆基和文汇报没有关系
    浦熙修在会上为罗隆基辩解，她谈到罗隆基从国外回来后没有和她谈过什么问题。浦熙修硬说罗隆基和文汇报没有关系。但她又承认，只有一次在罗隆基家里请过各民主党派人士吃饭，谈文汇报怎么工作，普遍征求意见。对叶笃义揭发罗隆基不让听文汇报党组的话，有事到北京来反映这件事，浦熙修为罗隆基作了这样的辩解：她理解罗隆基的意思是说党员水平低，罗隆基知道得更多些。
　　罗隆基说他如有反社会主义阴谋
    愿意受国法和盟章的制裁
    罗隆基在大家对他揭发批判之后，作了简短的发言。他说他没经过三反五反运动。这次运动对民盟有帮助，可以扫除一切反社会主义的思想，对国家也有好处。因此他表示诚心诚意欢迎这次运动。他表示要作深刻的反省，他一方面说：“我从来没有在民盟内说过我思想进步”，可是他接着又说，就是把他的骨头烧成灰，他也没有反对社会主义和反对党的领导的企图和阴谋，如果查出，愿意受国法和盟章制裁。
    罗隆基说他的确没有看过储安平在统战部座谈会上的发言稿。他说，不但事先没看，事后也没看，直到这次回国才看到。他说他曾为这事打电话给章伯钧，章伯钧是含糊其词，他认为这个问题章伯钧要负责任。接着，他又说，章伯钧为什么不说别人看了储安平的发言稿，而偏要说我？章伯钧这样说，社会上很多人也都相信，这就是我应该检讨的。
    罗隆基对他曾提出的“平反委员会”的问题，作了名词上的辩解。他说：我没有用过“平反委员会”这个名词。我说的是由人大常委会、政协、各民主党派共同组织一个“委员会”，这个委员会有三个作用，其中有平反作用，领导党也要参加。他又说，这话是错误的，他不否认。据他说，他所以说这样的话，是因为对毛主席的指示体会不深刻。
    罗隆基说：“最近有些人常常把章罗并提，我不愿意这样，我对自己的言论行动负责。”但他又说，他将交代他和章伯钧的关系。
    会上吴景超、吴晗、聂国清、刘清扬、钱端升也作了发言。
