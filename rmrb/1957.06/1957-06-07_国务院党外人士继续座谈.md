Xinhua News Agency, June 6th – At a symposium held this afternoon by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, inviting non-Party figures, Lu Yuwen, Assistant Secretary-General of the State Council, spoke first. He read aloud an anonymous threatening letter he had recently received.

The anonymous letter attacked Lu Yuwen's speech on May 25th at an enlarged meeting of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Central Committee. In that speech, Lu Yuwen stated that dismantling "walls" was a two-sided issue and disagreed with some people's stance that only criticism of the CCP was allowed, but not criticism of the critics. The anonymous letter insulted Lu Yuwen as "an accomplice of the tiger," being "shameless in the extreme," and threatened Lu Yuwen to "turn back as early as possible," otherwise, "you will not be spared."

The anonymous letter also said, "If the Communist Party only recognizes your kind," "it will one day head towards destruction."

Lu Yuwen received the threatening anonymous letter because he spoke a few factual words. He said: I am not afraid of insults, not afraid of threats, and I will continue to speak.

After reading the anonymous letter, Lu Yuwen said to everyone that because he spoke a few factual words at the RCCK Central Committee symposium, and criticized differing opinions, he was subjected to abuse, accused of being insincere, disloyal to the Party, and disloyal to the country. Now someone has written this anonymous letter to intimidate and insult me.

Lu Yuwen said that in the rectification campaign, offering opinions to the Party should be based on facts. Different situations lead to different opinions. We should speak out ourselves and also allow others to speak out. He said: "I do not understand why some people only allow negative words and not positive words, and are so hostile to those who speak positively. Some people insult me, some threaten me, and some adopt a 'fair' attitude to stifle my speech. Shouldn't we stand on the socialist standpoint? Isn't it because we have a common socialist standpoint that many issues can be people's internal contradictions? Since they are people's internal contradictions, why such abuse?" He also said that others are demanding to get off the sedan chair, step down from the stage, how can we achieve unity this way?

Lu Yuwen said that we should deeply consider, where do our criticisms of the Communist Party stem from? Where are we going? Lu Yuwen said he was not afraid of insults, not afraid of threats, and he would continue to speak.

During Lu Yuwen's speech, Li Zhonggong, State Council Counselor, mentioned that he also received a threatening anonymous letter because he criticized people who were offering opinions to the CCP. Li Zhonggong said he was not afraid of debate, but someone using this kind of method to deal with him was despicable.

Lu Yuwen then spoke about the relationship between the Party and the government. He said that we must realize that we are creating history, we are socialist democracy, which is different from bourgeois democracy. Capitalist countries implement a multi-party system, with parties in power and parties in opposition. We are a country where all parties are jointly in power. This point has been enshrined in the Constitution. As for how to manage the relationship between the Party and the government, there are no established rules to follow, no precedents to draw from. We are creating a system and must explore and advance in practice. Mistakes are inevitable in the process of exploration, but how can we shake the foundation of the system simply because there are mistakes?

He criticized Chu Anping's statement that "the idea of the Party ruling the world is the ultimate source of all sectarianism" as seriously wrong.

Lu Yuwen then pointed out that Chu Anping's statement that "the idea of the Party ruling the world is the ultimate source of all sectarianism" is seriously wrong. He said that this is a major distortion of historical and current facts. If this distortion is not corrected, it will cause the people of the whole country to lose their center of unity and direction of progress.

Lu Yuwen said that facts tell us that it is precisely because the Communist Party is not a sectarian party that it has been able to lead the people of the whole country and achieve the great unity of the 600 million people of the country. Anyone over the age of forty can recall the sectarianism of the Beijing government after the Xinhai Revolution, which divided China and almost led to its being divided up by the imperialists. Anyone over the age of thirty can recall the sectarianism of the Kuomintang era, when they did not allow the existence of other parties, and they had factions within themselves, such as the Political Science faction, the CC faction, the Military Statistics Bureau, and the Central Statistics Bureau. At that time, changing a principal would change a batch of teachers, and changing a head of the general affairs section would change a batch of workers, not to mention anything else.

Lu Yuwen said, memories are still fresh in our minds, have we all forgotten in seven or eight years?

Lu Yuwen said, I am glad that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the sectarianism in Chinese history has been eradicated, and I really don't know where Mr. Chu Anping's statement "the idea of the Party ruling the world is the ultimate source of all sectarianism" comes from?

Lu Yuwen also said that it is precisely because the Communist Party is a proletarian party, not a sectarian party, and does not allow sectarianism within the party, that it is launching a rectification campaign within its own party to rectify the sectarian ideology of individual party members and party organizations. Isn't this a very obvious fact? Lu Yuwen said that we cannot confuse the Party's leadership over the country with the sectarianism of individual party members and party organizations.

Lu Yuwen also criticized Chu Anping's statement that in the whole country, every unit, large or small, has to arrange for a Party member to be the leader, thus forming the current situation of a one-family world of uniformity. He said: Today's uniformity is socialist uniformity, but it is not Communist Party uniformity. Are there more Party members or non-Party members among the cadres of various agencies, schools, and enterprises across the country? There are many Party members who are leaders, but can we say that there are few non-Party members who are ministers, governors, directors, division chiefs, bureau chiefs, and section chiefs? How can this be called uniformity?

Lu Yuwen said that as for the fact that there are no non-Party members as Vice Chairmen and Vice Premiers in the Central People's Government now, and they have all become Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, is this due to sectarian ideology? Or is it due to consideration of how non-Party members can better play their role in national management? According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Chairman can only issue laws and decrees based on the resolutions and decisions of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the Vice Chairman only assists the Chairman. Under the spirit of this constitutional provision, can non-Party members play a better role as Vice Chairmen or as Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress? There are no non-Party members as Vice Premiers of the State Council, but the number of non-Party members as Ministers of the various ministries of the State Council has increased. Is it more effective for non-Party members to have a few more Vice Premiers or a few more Ministers? This is a question worth studying and discussing, but it should not be regarded as sectarianism.

Lu Yuwen said, I believe that there is sectarian ideology among individual Communist Party members and Party organizations. For example, Ding Guitang of the RCCK, who serves as Deputy Director of the General Administration of Customs, cannot have any real power, and Chen Qiyuan's exposure of a certain factory where the administration, Party, Youth League, and trade union are all relatives. There are many such examples that have been exposed and should be corrected based on facts.

The leadership of the Communist Party cannot be shaken; the socialist direction cannot be blurred; the quality of the system and methods should be judged by the interests of the people, and cannot be determined by personal preferences and habits.

Lu Yuwen suggested summarizing and studying the relationship between the Party and the government to make it institutionalized. He believed that in the research, three basic principles should be followed: 1. The leadership of the Communist Party cannot be shaken; 2. The socialist direction cannot be blurred; 3. The quality of the system and methods should be judged by the interests of the people, and cannot be determined by personal preferences and habits.

Lu Yuwen's second opinion was to strengthen the legal system. He said, "Mere goodness is not enough for governance, and mere law cannot implement itself." It is not enough to have good intentions; there must also be a legal system to consolidate them. This is a very important task for the future. He then put forward three suggestions in this regard: 1. Abide by the law, and if there is a law, it must be obeyed; 2. Organize the regulations. Since the promulgation of the Constitution, many regulations are no longer suitable, and society is progressing too fast, so they need to be organized; 3. Create a legal system, create new laws, and establish new systems.

Lu Yuwen then put forward four specific suggestions on creating a legal system. First, formulate the relationship between the Party and the government. Many Party committees and Party groups vary from person to person and from place to place. Now, it is necessary to stipulate them based on summarizing past practical experience; second, create procedural law to solve the issue of the authority of the National People's Congress and the State Council, the State Council and various ministries, and the central government and local governments in legislation and formulation of regulations; third, formulate organizational regulations for various agencies to clearly define the business nature, scope of powers, and organizational structure of various agencies; fourth, formulate internal work regulations for various agencies as the basis for internal control to solve the issue of hierarchical responsibility and tiered responsibility, so that people have specific positions and positions have specific responsibilities.

Jin Handing criticized the idea of "one excels in learning and then becomes an official," and suggested making provisions for primary and secondary school students to participate in production.

Jin Handing, State Council Counselor, talked about the issue of primary and secondary school graduates participating in productive labor. Jin Handing criticized the ideological poisons of the exploiting classes that have been passed down for thousands of years, such as "one excels in learning, then becomes an official," "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those labor with their strength are governed by others," and "hoping that one's son will become a dragon." In order to correct this ideology and establish a labor viewpoint, he suggested that the education department make provisions for primary and secondary school students to participate in labor production after graduation.

Secondly, Jin Handing talked about family background and individual composition. He believes that although the central government has not explicitly stipulated any restrictions on the children of exploiters, they are actually subject to discrimination and various restrictions. He demanded that the children of landlords and capitalists be given genuine equal treatment in terms of schooling and work. Jin Handing also talked about the issue of salary evaluation and grading.

Zuo Zonglun believed that offering opinions should be based on goodwill. If the speech is for venting anger and has ulterior motives, this is wrong and cannot achieve the purpose of unity.

Zuo Zonglun, State Council Counselor, talked about his views on "contending" and "letting go." He said that recently many people have been able to speak boldly, and some people still have concerns and do not speak, which shows that they do not trust the Party enough. He said that there are various ways of speaking. Some talk about negative opinions, and some talk about both positive and negative opinions. He believes that it is okay not to say positive opinions, but it doesn't matter if you say them. In short, it should be based on goodwill, which is more helpful. If the speech is for venting anger and has ulterior motives, this is wrong and cannot achieve the purpose of unity.

Zhai Jianxiong, a researcher at the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, expressed great dissatisfaction with certain grassroots cadres in his speech. Zhai Jianxiong also criticized the phenomenon that the Party and the government do not pay enough attention to handling people's letters and visits.

### 国务院党外人士继续座谈

    国务院党外人士继续座谈
    新华社6日讯　在国务院秘书长习仲勋今天下午邀请党外人士举行的座谈会上，国务院秘书长助理卢郁文首先发言，他宣读了他最近收到的一封匿名恐吓信。
    这封匿名信攻击卢郁文5月25日在民革中央小组扩大会议上的发言，卢郁文在那次发言中曾认为拆“墙”是两方面的事，并且不同意有些人只许批评中共、不许批评批评者的主张。匿名信辱骂卢郁文“为虎作伥”，是“无耻之尤”，并恫吓卢郁文“及早回头”，还说否则“不会饶恕你的”。
    这封匿名信还说，“共产党如果只认你这班人的话”，“总有一天会走向灭亡”。
    卢郁文收到恫吓他的匿名信，因为他说了几句实事求是的话。他说：我不怕辱骂，不怕威胁，我还要讲话。
    卢郁文在读完这封匿名信以后对大家说，因为我在民革中央小组座谈会上说了几句实事求是的话，对于不同意的意见提出了批评，就遭到了谩骂，骂我是言不由衷，对党不实，对国不忠。现在又有人写这封匿名信来威吓我、辱骂我。
    卢郁文说，整风中向党提意见应当实事求是，有不同的情况就有不同的意见，自己鸣，也要让别人鸣。他说：“我不理解有人为什么只许说反面话不许说正面话，对讲了正面话的人就这样仇视，有的人辱骂我，有的人威胁我，有的装出‘公正’的态度来钳制我的发言，难道我们不应该站在社会主义的立场上吗？难道不是因为我们有了社会主义的共同立场，所以许多问题才能是人民内部矛盾吗？既然是人民内部矛盾，为什么要如此谩骂？”他还说，另外还有的人要求下轿、下台，这样怎么能够达到团结呢？
    卢郁文说，我们应当深思，我们对共产党的批评究竟是从什么地方出发？要到什么地方去呢？卢郁文说，他不怕辱骂，不怕威胁，他还要讲话。
    在卢郁文发言当中，国务院参事李仲公谈到他也因为批评了对中共提意见的人而收到了一封对他进行威胁的匿名信，李仲公说，我不怕辩论，但有人采用这种手段来对付我是卑鄙的。
    卢郁文接着谈到党政关系问题。他说，我们要意识到我们在创造历史，我们是社会主义民主，与资产阶级民主不同。资本主义国家实行多党制，有在朝党、在野党。我们是各党派共同在朝的国家。这一点已载在宪法中。至于党政关系如何运用，没有成规可循，没有先例可援，是在创造体例，要在实践中摸索前进。在摸索中不可能没有错误，但我们怎能因为有错误就动摇了制度的根本呢？
    他批评储安平的发言“党天下的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源”的提法是严重错误的。
    卢郁文接着指出，储安平说“党天下”的思想是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源这种提法是严重错误的。他说，这是对于历史和现时的事实的重大歪曲。这个歪曲不纠正，会使全国人民失掉了团结的中心和前进的方向。
    卢郁文说，事实告诉我们，正是由于共产党不是一个宗派主义的党，才能够领导全国人民，达到了全国六亿人民的大团结。凡是四十岁以上的人都可以回忆起辛亥革命后北京政府时代的宗派主义把中国搞得四分五裂，几乎被帝国主义瓜分。凡是三十岁以上的人，都可以回忆一下国民党时代的宗派主义，他们不许异党存在，他们内部有政学系、CC系、军统、中统等派系。在那个时候，换了一个校长就换一批教员，换了一个庶务科长就换一批工友，更不用说别的了。
    卢郁文说，往事记忆犹新，难道我们七、八年就都忘记了吗？
    卢郁文说，我正庆幸由于共产党的领导，把中国历史上的宗派主义铲除干净，真不知道储安平先生的“党天下的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源”这句话是从何说起？
    卢郁文又说，正是由于共产党是无产阶级的党，不是宗派主义的党，是不容许党内有宗派主义，才要在自己党内发动整风，把个别党员和党组织的宗派主义思想整掉，这不正是很明显的事实吗？卢郁文说，我们不能把党对国家的领导和个别党员、党组织的宗派主义混为一谈。
    卢郁文还批评了储安平所说的在全国范围内不论大小单位都要安排一个党员做头儿，从而形成了现在这样一个一家天下的清一色局面的说法。他说：今天的清一色是社会主义的清一色，但并不是共产党的清一色。全国各机关、学校、企业单位的干部究竟是党员多呢，还是非党员多呢？党员做头儿的不少，非党员做部长、省长、局长、司长、厅长、科长的能说少吗？这怎么叫做清一色呢？
    卢郁文说，至于说中央人民政府现在没有党外人士做副主席和副总理，而都当了人大常委会的副委员长，这是由于宗派主义思想而来的呢？还是由于考虑到党外人士在国家管理中，如何才能更好地发挥作用而来的呢？依照宪法的规定，主席是只能根据全国人民代表大会和人大常委会的决议、决定发布法律法令，而副主席只是辅助主席。在这种宪法规定的精神下，党外人士究竟是做副主席，还是在人大做副委员长更能发挥作用呢？国务院副总理是没有党外人士了，但国务院各部部长的党外人士是增加了。究竟党外人士是多几个副总理、还是多几个部长更能发挥作用呢？这是值得研究讨论的问题，但绝不能以此认为就是宗派主义。
    卢郁文说，我认为在个别共产党员和党组织中是有宗派主义思想的，如民革的丁贵堂担任海关总署副署长不能有职有权，又如陈其瑗揭露的某工厂的行政、党、团、工会都是亲戚，这些事例揭发出来的有很多，都应实事求是地加以纠正。
    共产党的领导不容动摇；社会主义方向不容模糊；制度方法的好坏以人民的利益为标准，不能凭个人好恶习惯来决定。
    卢郁文建议对党政关系加以总结研究，使之制度化，他认为在研究时应根据这样三条基本原则：一、共产党的领导不容动摇，二、社会主义方向不容模糊，三、制度方法的好坏以人民的利益为标准，不能凭个人好恶习惯来决定。
    卢郁文的第二个意见是加强法制，他说，“徒善不足以为政，徒法不能以自行”，单有好心是不够的，还必须有法制把它巩固起来。这是今后很重要的工作。他接着在这方面提出了三点建议：一、遵守法制，有了法就必须遵守；二、整理法规，从宪法颁布后，好多法规已不适合了，社会进步太快，须要整理；三、创建法制，创造新的法律，建立新的制度。
    卢郁文接着就创建法制提出了四点具体建议。第一、拟定党政关系，党委、党组很多是因人而异，因地而异，现在须要从总结过去实践经验中加以规定；第二、创制法制程序法，解决全国人民代表大会与国务院、国务院与各部、中央与地方在立法与制订法规上的权限问题；第三、制定各机关的组织法规，对各机关的业务性质、职权范围、机构编制加以明确规定；第四、制定各机关内部工作规程，作为内部掌握的依据，解决分级负责、分层负责的问题，使人有专职、职有专责。
    金汉鼎批评了“学而优则仕”的思想，建议对中小学生参加生产做出规定。
    国务院参事金汉鼎谈到了中小学毕业生参加生产劳动问题。金汉鼎批评了“学而优则仕”、“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”以及“望子成龙”等数千年流传下来剥削阶级的思想毒素。为了纠正这种思想，树立劳动观点，他建议教育部门作出中小学生毕业以后参加劳动生产的规定。
    其次，金汉鼎谈到家庭出身和个人成分问题。他认为，中央虽然没有明文规定对剥削者的子女有什么约束，但在实际上受到歧视和种种限制。他要求对地主资本家的子女在读书和工作等方面给予真正的平等待遇。金汉鼎还谈到了评薪定级的问题。
    左宗纶认为提意见应该从善意出发，如果发言是为了出气，别有用心，这就不对，不能达到团结的目的
    国务院参事左宗纶谈到他对“鸣”“放”的看法，他说，最近许多人都能大胆说话，也有些人还有顾虑，有话不说，这表现对党还不够信任。他说，说话也有各式各样的说法，有的谈反面的意见，有的正面反面意见都谈，他认为正面意见不说也可以，但是说了也没关系。总之，应该从善意出发，这样才更有帮助；如果发言为了出气，别有用心，这就不对，就不能达到团结的目的。
    中国文字改革委员会研究员翟健雄在发言中对某些基层干部表示非常不满。翟健雄又批评了党和政府对处理人民来信来访不重视的现象。
