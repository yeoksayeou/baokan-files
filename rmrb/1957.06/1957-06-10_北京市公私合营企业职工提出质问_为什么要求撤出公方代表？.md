    Beijing Joint State-Private Enterprise Workers Question: Why Demand the Withdrawal of Public Representatives?
    (Our Newspaper News) The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions invited workers and staff from seven joint state-private factories and stores to a forum on the afternoon of the 8th. Participants at the forum angrily denounced the person who wrote the threatening letter to Lu Yuwen. They raised sharp criticisms of some of the erroneous statements made by Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, Li Kangnian, and others.
    Gao Shiying, the labor and wage cadre of the Beijiao No. 4 Wood Factory, said, "We warn the person who wrote the threatening letter that no matter what means you use, you cannot scare the people or take away the people's power." This incident has given me another education and raised my vigilance. Gao Shiying raised objections to Ge Peiqi's speech. He said, "Ge Peiqi's statement that 'the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries was a mess' is not based on facts. Was it a mess to arrest the 'Four Tyrants of Tianqiao' and other counterrevolutionaries? The fact that there is not enough pork to eat now is not a sign of a decline in people's lives, but a sign of an improvement in people's lives. When I was a worker in the past, I couldn't even eat pork or white flour. Now I can eat meat every week, and even more during festivals. The era when there was meat but no one could afford to buy it is over. I don't know why Ge Peiqi is telling such blatant lies." Gao Shiying said, "When my grandmother heard Ge Peiqi say that the masses wanted to kill the Communist Party, she was very angry and said, 'It's pure nonsense to say that the Communist Party doesn't work for the people.'" I ask Mr. Ge Peiqi: Who do you represent with this black and white reversed fallacy? Is a knowledge intellectual who is also a people's lecturer less sensible than a sixty or seventy-year-old woman? There are only two explanations for this: one is that he is a mentally abnormal person; the other is that he wants to take advantage of the great 'blooming' and 'contending' to carry out ulterior motives.
    Zhou Huating, deputy director of the Ruifuxiang Store, said that Chu Anping's statement about "the Party's world" is completely inconsistent with the facts. Take our textile company as an example. The city company has capitalists as managers, and the central store also has capitalists as managers or directors. The current director of our unit is a private sector personnel. How can you close your eyes and say "the Party's world"?
    Zhou Huating opposed Dong Shao Chen's suggestion. He said, "We will not agree to the withdrawal of public representatives. We will not allow capitalists to stand on top of our workers and do whatever they want again."
    Wang Hailin, a foundry worker at Jianzhong Factory, said that demanding the withdrawal of public representatives is a manifestation of resisting transformation. Do they want to go back to the old ways again? Wang Hailin criticized those who demand a fixed interest rate for twenty years, saying, "Why don't you think about where your property comes from? Did it grow on its own or was it created by the labor of the workers? A fixed interest rate of five percent for seven years has already demonstrated the spirit of our working class uniting to transform capitalists and strive for them to serve socialism. Now some people not only are not grateful to the working class but also demand to continue exploiting for a long time!"
    Chen Qilun, a financial cost member of the Beijing Joint State-Private Riyi Water Pump Factory, said that since liberation, our grain production has increased, our steel has increased from 900,000 tons before liberation to 4.5 million tons, and our cloth has increased from 30 million bolts at the beginning of liberation to 130 million bolts. These achievements are the result of the Communist Party leading the people in hard struggle. I want Ge Peiqi to answer: "If we don't want the Communist Party to lead, what party should lead?"
    You Yanbian, deputy director of the Finance Section of Lianchang Factory, said that some private sector personnel have forgotten the pain after the wound has healed, one-sidedly exaggerating certain shortcomings of the public representatives, ignoring the role of the broad masses of workers, and actually demanding the withdrawal of public representatives, which our entire factory workers fundamentally disagree with.
    Liu Qingqian, a statistician at Xinfeng Screw Factory, expressed opposition to the withdrawal of public representatives in his speech. He said, "If the public representatives are withdrawn, is it still considered a joint state-private enterprise, or is it reverting to a private enterprise?"

    北京市公私合营企业职工提出质问
    为什么要求撤出公方代表？
    本报讯　北京市总工会于8日下午邀请了七个公私合营工厂和商店的工人、职员举行座谈会。参加座谈会的人愤怒地痛斥给卢郁文写恐吓信的人。他们对储安平、葛佩琦、李康年等人的一些错误言论，提出了尖锐的批评。
    北郊第四木器厂劳动工资干事高世瀛说，我们警告写恐吓信的人，不管你用什么手段是吓不倒人民，夺不走人民的政权的。这一件事情使我又得到一次教育，提高了我的警惕性。高世瀛对葛佩琦的发言提出了反对的意见。他说，葛佩琦说“肃反搞糟了”是不看事实，难道把天桥四霸天和其它一些反革命分子逮捕起来是搞糟了吗？现在猪肉不够吃，不是人民生活降低而是人民生活提高的表现。我自己过去当工人的时候，猪肉白面都吃不到，现在每礼拜能吃上肉，节日还吃得多些。过去那种有肉没有人买的时代已经过去了。我不知道葛佩琦为什么要睁眼说瞎话？高世瀛说，我的老奶奶听到葛佩琦说群众要杀共产党的话，就很气愤地说：“说共产党不为老百姓，纯粹是胡说。”我请问葛佩琦先生：你这种颠倒黑白的谬论是代表那些“群众”？身为人民讲师的知识分子难道还不如六、七十岁的老太太懂道理？这只有两个解释：一是他是一个神经不正常的人；一是想借大“放”大“鸣”的机会，进行不可告人的勾当。
    瑞蚨祥门市部副主任周华亭说，储安平说什么“党天下”，完全与事实不符。就拿我们纺织品公司来说，市公司有资本家当经理，中心商店也有资本家当经理或主任，我们单位的正主任就是私方人员，这怎么能够闭起眼睛说“党天下”呢？
    周华亭反对董少臣的建议。他说，撤出公方代表我们不答应。我们不允许资本家再站在我们工人头上为所欲为。
    建中工厂翻砂工人王海霖说，要求撤出公方代表是抗拒改造的表现，是不是又想恢复到老样子？王海霖批评那些要求定息二十年的人说，为什么你不想想，你的财产是从那里来的？是自己长的还是工人劳动创造的？定息五厘、七年已经表现了我们工人阶级团结改造资本家、争取他们为社会主义服务的精神。现在有些人不但不感激工人阶级，反而要求长期剥削下去！
    北京市公私合营日益水泵厂财务成本员陈启纶说，解放后，我们的粮食增产了，我们的钢由解放前的九十万吨增加到四百五十万吨，布匹由解放初的三千万匹增加到一亿三千万匹，这些成绩，都是共产党领导人民艰苦奋斗的结果。我要葛佩琦回答：“不要共产党领导，究竟要什么党来领导？”
    联昌工厂财务科副科长由延边说，有些私方人员好了疮忘了痛，片面夸大公方代表某些缺点，漠视了广大工人群众的作用，居然要求撤出公方代表，这是我们全厂工人根本不同意的。
    新风螺丝钉厂统计员刘清乾在发言中，表示反对撤出公方代表。他说，如果撤出公方代表，究竟算是公私合营，还是退回到私营呢？
