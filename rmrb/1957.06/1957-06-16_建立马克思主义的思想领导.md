Regarding the issue of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending and establishing Marxist-Leninist ideological leadership, there are different views now. Some believe that the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending will lead to ideological confusion and hinder the unified ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Some believe that having the unified ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism will affect the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending. Others believe that today's Hundred Schools of Thought Contending should definitely be under the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism. These seemingly different statements, in essence, share a common understanding: that the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending and the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism are two opposing things.

I think this understanding is wrong. True Marxism-Leninism is realistic and seeks truth from facts, starting from the actual situation to make specific analyses. Every society is in the process of historical development, with different productive forces, different relations of production and social relations, and different groups of people. These differences will inevitably be reflected in people's ideology and give rise to different understandings and different opinions. Marxism-Leninism must acknowledge these differences and make specific analyses based on this foundation.

Some people do not recognize this principle. Some people even attempt to abolish the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism under the guise of the slogan of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending. I don't think this is possible and it is wrong. Because Marxism-Leninism is the truth that seeks truth from facts. To abolish Marxism-Leninism is to deny the facts and abolish the truth. Without the combination of Marxism-Leninism and China's specific conditions, the victory of China's New Democratic Revolution and Socialist Revolution is unimaginable. Future socialist construction also needs to rely on the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism. This leading position is the inevitable result of the development of China's New Democratic Revolution and Socialist Revolution over the past forty years.

On the contrary, the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending is the best way to establish Marxist-Leninist ideological leadership. Because in the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, there will inevitably be truth and falsehood. Everyone judges truth and falsehood based on the facts, and in the end, a truth that conforms to the objective nature of things will inevitably be reached, and this is the truth of Marxism-Leninism that seeks truth from facts.

Of course, the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending is not without time, conditions, and place. Marxism-Leninism starts from specific situations.

Now, in our country, the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves has become secondary, and the contradiction among the people has become the main aspect of the contradiction. To resolve the contradictions among the people, especially academic issues, we must seek truth from objective things and achieve consensus through persuasion and education. The Hundred Schools of Thought Contending is the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism in the current specific environment. It will liberate our academic thought from the shackles of dogmatism and develop it in the direction of seeking truth from facts. This is essentially different from the doctrine of freedom of thought in the bourgeois democratic revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The principle seems very simple. But people's thinking has inertia. People who have been cultivated from the bourgeois democratic and free doctrines inevitably look at problems from this perspective, thinking that democracy is an end, not a means. And people who have lived in the struggle between the enemy and ourselves for a long time and are accustomed to ideological constraints are also prone to ignore the current transformation of domestic contradictions and habitually view the contradictions among the people from the perspective of the struggle between the enemy and ourselves.

I am an amateur economist. In the eight years since liberation, from the perspective of amateur economics research, I have been in the cold palace, unable to get data, unable to have exchanges with peers (time is also a problem). Although economics is not my profession, I can leave it alone, but after thirty years of immersion in it, it has become a part of my ideology, and I cannot abandon it. In recent years, I have been insisting on self-study and have also written many notes and fragments of papers, but the more I do, the more I feel that I am becoming an annotator of classic works, a dogmatist. That's wrong. Therefore, I discarded all the manuscripts. The proposal of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending has given me new encouragement. Under the policy of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, economists should hopefully be able to put aside dogma and study knowledge realistically. Many economic friends whom I haven't seen for a long time also have the same feeling.

Of course, there are still problems. Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. It is difficult to study economics without being detached from current politics. The development of the national economy is so rapid and so colorful that even those who actually lead the national economic construction can hardly keep up. What can economic science researchers who are detached from actual work do? This is not only a matter of materials and confidentiality, but especially a matter of experience and understanding of actual work. Since they are detached from reality and cannot keep up with the development of the situation, they naturally feel it is difficult to intervene in current economic issues, policies, and guidelines. How to enable economists to link theory with practice, master the necessary materials, and keep up with the development of the situation as much as possible, so that they can derive the laws of development from the actual economy, so as to establish Marxist-Leninist ideological leadership in economics.

Researching economics (and other disciplines) often involves issues such as policies and guidelines. I think these issues should also be open for discussion. Precisely because policies and guidelines are related to the majority of the people, they need extensive discussion even more. I don't think it is necessary to worry that policies and guidelines cannot be discussed. Of course, as a state cadre, you must be responsible to the state and the people, and some influential issues (such as those involving diplomatic relations) need to be considered carefully, and you must have your own control.

In the rectification movement these days, some intellectuals have made prominent remarks that deviate from socialism and deviate from seeking truth from facts. Our newspapers have published them all. This shows the impartiality of speaking out freely and airing views fully. Opinions that disagree with these remarks and raise counter-criticism in society should of course also be published in full. After full debate, a truth will inevitably be reached in the end, and people with ideological errors today will also be educated. The ideological consensus achieved through this path is the truth of Marxism-Leninism. But I want to remind you that speaking must be based on facts, and you should try to face the facts as comprehensively as possible. It is wrong to deviate from the facts or make judgments based on fragmentary facts. It is even more inappropriate to scold, intimidate, or hinder others from speaking. Using this attitude to discuss issues cannot solve problems. Using this attitude to participate in the rectification will hinder the rectification. Using this attitude to replace the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending will hinder the development of academic thought. As long as we adhere to the facts and adhere to reasoning, debate and contention will inevitably lead us to the truth of Marxism-Leninism.

    建立马克思主义的思想领导
    邮电部副部长  谷春帆
    对于百家争鸣和建立马克思列宁主义思想领导这问题，现在有不同看法。有人以为百家争鸣会使得思想混乱，妨碍马克思列宁主义的统一思想领导。有人以为有了马克思列宁主义的统一思想领导，就会影响到百家争鸣。也有人以为今天的百家争鸣，应当肯定是在马克思列宁主义思想领导下的百家争鸣。这种种表面上不同的说法，实质上有一点共同的认识：以为百家争鸣和马克思列宁主义的思想领导是对立的两回事。
    我以为这样认识是不对的。真正的马克思列宁主义是实事求是的，是从实际情况出发作具体分析的。任何一个社会都处在历史的发展过程中，有不同的生产力，有不同的生产关系和社会关系，有不同的人群集团。这些不同，必然会得反映到人们的思想意识中去，而发生不同的认识，不同的意见。马克思列宁主义是必须承认这些不同，并从这个基础上去作具体分析。
    有些人不承认这道理。甚至有些人竟在百家争鸣的口号掩护下，企图取消马克思列宁主义的思想领导。我看这是做不到的，是错误的。因为马克思列宁主义就是实事求是的真理。取消马克思列宁主义就是否认事实，取消真理。没有马克思列宁主义与中国具体情况的结合，我国新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的胜利是不可想像的。今后社会主义建设同样需要依靠马克思列宁主义的思想领导。这个领导地位是四十年来中国新民主主义革命和社会主义革命中发展而来的必然结果。
    恰恰相反，百家争鸣正是建立马克思列宁主义思想领导的最好途径。因为百家争鸣，必然有真理和歪理。真理和歪理大家取决于事实，最后必然得出一个与客观事实本性相符合的道理，而这就是实事求是的马克思列宁主义的道理。
    当然，百家争鸣不是没有时间、条件和地点的，马克思列宁主义是从具体情况出发的。
    现在，在我们国内，敌我矛盾已经转成次要，人民内部矛盾转化成为矛盾的主要方面。要解决人民内部的矛盾，特别是学术问题，必须从客观事物中寻出真理，从说服教育中取得一致。百家争鸣就是在当前具体环境里的马克思列宁主义思想领导。它将把我们的学术思想从教条主义的束缚中解放出来而朝着实事求是的方向去发展。这和十八、九世纪资产阶级民主革命的思想自由学说，本质上是不同的。
    道理似乎很简单。但人们的思想是有惰性的。从资产阶级民主自由的学说中培养出来的人，不免要从这方面看问题，以为民主是目的不是手段。而长期在敌我斗争中生活，思想束缚惯了的人，也易于忽视了目前国内矛盾的转化，习惯地要从敌我斗争的角度来看待人民内部的矛盾。
    我是个业余研究经济学的人，解放八年，从业余研究经济学一点说，我是在冷宫里，得不到资料，得不到同行的切磋琢磨（时间也有困难）。虽然经济学不是我的本业，我很可以丢开它不管，但三十年浸渍其中，它成了我思想意识的一部分，我不能丢下它。几年来我一直坚持着自学，也写了很多札记和论文断片，但是愈来我愈觉得自己在变成一个经典著作的注疏者，一个教条主义者。错了。因此，我把全部稿件都废了。百家争鸣方针的提出，给了我新的鼓舞。在百家争鸣的方针下，经济学者应当有希望可以抛开教条实事求是地研究学问了。好些长久不见的经济学朋友大家也都有同感。
    当然也还有问题。政治是经济的集中表现。研究经济很难离开当前政治。国家经济的发展这样迅速，这样丰富多彩，实际领导国家经济建设的人尚且很难赶上，脱离实际工作的经济科学研究者能有什么办法呢？这不仅是个材料问题、保密问题，而尤其是个实际工作的经验与体会问题。既然脱离了实际，跟不上形势的发展，对于当前经济问题、政策、方针，自然也就感到难于插嘴了。如何使经济学者能够把理论联系实际，掌握必要的材料，和尽可能地跟上形势的发展，使他们能够从实际经济中得出发展的规律，这样才能在经济学中建立马克思列宁主义的思想领导。
    研究经济学（以至其他学科）往往要牵涉到政策方针等问题。我觉得这些问题也是应当可以公开讨论的。正因为政策方针等等是关系到多数人民的事，所以更需要广泛的讨论。以为政策方针不能讨论而有顾虑，我看是不需要的。当然作为国家干部，对国家对人民自己要负责，某些有影响的问题（例如牵涉到外交关系的）需要谨慎考虑，自己有个掌握。
    这几天整风运动中出现了一些知识分子的突出地离开社会主义、离开实事求是的言论。我们的报纸一概予以发表。这说明了鸣和放的大公无私。社会上不同意这些言论而提出反批评的意见，当然也应该一概发表。经过充分辩论，最后必然能够得出一个真理，而使今天思想错误的人也受到教育。通过这样途径而取得的思想一致，就是马克思列宁主义的真理。但是我要提醒一句，说话必须根据事实，并且应该尽可能全面地正视事实。脱离了事实，或抓住了片段的事实而作出论断是会错误的。谩骂，恐吓，或阻挠别人发言，那更是不应该。用这种态度来讨论问题，不能解决问题。用这种态度来参加整风，就会妨碍整风。用这种态度来代替百家争鸣，就会妨碍学术思想底发展。只要坚持事实，坚持说理，论辩和争鸣必然把我们引导到马克思列宁主义的真理上去。
