These economic figures suggested that various public and private industrial and commercial organizations in Italy should actively and fully utilize the current favorable conditions to establish direct contacts with Chinese trade institutions, and take various measures, such as preparing to hold exhibitions, opening routes to major Chinese ports, and seeking agreements on payment methods for trade between the two countries. They also advocated that the two countries send cultural and technical delegations to each other and sign cultural agreements to continuously promote cultural exchanges.
