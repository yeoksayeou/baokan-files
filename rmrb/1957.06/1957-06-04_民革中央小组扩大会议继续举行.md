Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Central Small Group Enlarged Meeting Continues

    This newspaper reports that the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Central Small Group Enlarged Meeting continued on the morning of June 3rd. More than 30 people attended, including the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Standing Committee members, and Central Committee members in Beijing.

    Qian Changzhao Criticizes Some Party Members for Being Arrogant

    Qian Changzhao stated at the meeting that after the victory of the revolution, some party members became arrogant and complacent, looking down on non-Party members, showing indifference, and even contempt, which caused strong resentment among the masses, especially within the ranks of intellectuals. At the same time, due to the arduous process of the revolution, it is necessary for some party members to naturally maintain appropriate vigilance, but excessive vigilance, constant suspicion, discrimination, and even hostility towards non-Party members makes non-Party members who are willing to learn from the leading party and contribute everything to the country feel heartbroken, and also turns some positive factors in society into negative factors.

    Qian Changzhao said that individual party members are indeed extremely arrogant. Sometimes, when contacting them for official business, letters are not answered, phone calls are not returned, and after repeated urging, you receive an extremely cold reply. This is an extremely rude and terrible attitude towards people. These comrades should put down their airs; otherwise, they will neither be able to approach the masses, nor will the masses be able to approach them.

    He said that through this rectification campaign, the leading party will certainly improve further, and the democratic parties must also improve. The leading party is now rectifying and correcting simultaneously, and the democratic parties, on the one hand, are helping the leading party in its rectification campaign, and on the other hand, should examine their own work, promote democracy, and overcome shortcomings.

    Weng Wenhao Says the United Front Work Below is Empty and Meaningless

    He said that the united front work below is done in a hollow and perfunctory manner, existing in name only. He said that the general manager of the Yongming Paint Factory in Tianjin is a chemical expert with many years of experience in paint manufacturing and has achieved great success, but because he is not a party member, he is discriminated against by the party member manager, and he cannot ask about technical issues. When he wanted to conduct experiments, there were no raw materials. He also mentioned that when he went to Henan for inspection last year, he invited non-Party engineers from some factories in Luoyang to a forum. Many people said that they could not understand the situation and that there was a gap with the Party. He analyzed that in the past, the Communist Party regarded the exploiting classes as enemies in order to overthrow them, which was correct, but now the situation is different, but they are still regarded as enemies and not trusted. He said that if this absolute concept is not eliminated, the Communist Party will become divorced from the masses, and construction will not succeed. In this situation, it is unfair to accuse non-Party members of not having a sense of ownership and being passive in their work.

    Ding Guitang Believes That Correct and Appropriate Freedom in Using Non-Party Individuals Will Eliminate the So-Called Walls and Ditches

    Ding Guitang said that he believes that the formation of sectarianism is due to their belief that they are made of special materials, that they are superior to ordinary people, and that they look down on non-Party individuals.

    He said that if the relevant party members can change their understanding, admit that non-Party individuals are also Chinese people like them, and also have a patriotic heart and a sense of justice, admit that the policy and ideological level of non-Party individuals is not as high as that of ordinary party members, but has been considerably improved through years of party education and subjective efforts to learn, admit that non-Party individuals wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party and are willing to follow the Party forever, admit that non-Party individuals wholeheartedly support the cause of socialism and communism and are willing to serve the people wholeheartedly, in short, if they can admit that non-Party individuals can be completely trusted, and they can be used correctly and appropriately, then the so-called walls and ditches can cease to exist.

    Chen Jianchen Disagrees with Some of the Views of Zhang Naiqi and Chu Anping

    Chen Jianchen spoke, first expressing her views on "letting go" and "contending." She believes that many people are afraid of "closing up," and some people want to "close up." She believes that there is no reason to be afraid of closing up; and if some people want to close up, they will not be able to. Once the seeds are sown, you cannot harvest them early; you have to wait for the grain ears to grow; forced harvesting will go against people's will.

    She believes that anything can be said, and there can be debate. After "contending" and "letting go," we should enter the stage of distinguishing right from wrong. She analyzed and criticized Zhang Naiqi's speech at the National Federation of Industry and Commerce's Guidance Work Symposium on Industrial and Commercial Transformation, which was published in the People's Daily on June 2nd. She said that Zhang Naiqi believes that "fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income," "bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism," "if work is divided into public and private, and party and non-party, then the work will never be done well," "the bourgeoisie and the working class have essential differences, but the members of these two classes cannot be said to have essential differences," and these views are wrong.

    She expressed dissatisfaction with Guangming Daily editor-in-chief Chu Anping's speech at the forum convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, "Now there are as many as twelve vice-premiers of the State Council, none of whom are non-Party members. Is it that there is not a single non-Party member who can sit in this chair?" She indignantly questioned, "Did we participate in the revolution for the purpose of sitting in a chair?" At the same time, she also criticized Chu Anping's discussion of the coalition government issue. She said that Mao Zedong said this during the democratic revolution; but it is different after the 1954 Constitution was promulgated. The Constitution stipulates clearly that the People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Now we are eliminating classes, so how can there be a class coalition government? We cannot apply the reasoning of the past to today.

    Cai Tingkai mentioned in his speech that although he served as a member of the National Defense Commission, deputy director of the Sports Commission, and member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, there were not many things to do. He expressed dissatisfaction with this.

    Su Congzhou, Shao Hengqiu, and Liu Fei also spoke at the meeting.

### 民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行

    民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行
    本报讯　民革中央小组扩大会议在3日上午继续举行。到会有主席、副主席、常务委员和在京中央委员三十多人。
    钱昌照批评有些党员架子十足
    钱昌照在会上发言说，革命胜利以后，有些党员同志骄傲自满，对党外人士看不起，漠视甚而至于鄙视，这在群众中，特别在知识分子队伍里，引起强烈反感；同时又由于革命的艰苦过程，有些党员同志很自然地保持适当的警惕是必要的，但过分警惕，对党外人士老是怀疑，歧视甚而至于敌视，这就使得愿意向领导党学习、愿意为国家贡献一切的党外人士感到伤心，也就使得社会上有些积极因素变成消极因素。
    钱昌照说，个别党员同志确是架子十足。有时为了公事同他们联系，去信不回信，去电话不回电话，一而再再而三地催促，给你一个极其冷淡的答复，这是极粗暴恶劣的对人态度。这些同志应放下架子，否则，他们既不能接近群众，群众也无法去接近他们。
    他说，经过此次整风，领导党当然更加提高，民主党派也必须提高。领导党现在是边整边改，民主党派一方面帮助领导党整风，一方面应当检查一下自己的工作，发扬民主，克服缺点。
    翁文灏说，下面的统战工作，作得空空洞洞，有名无实。他说，天津有一家永明漆厂的总经理是化学专家，有多年制漆经验，很有成就，但因为是非党员，就受党员经理的歧视，技术上的问题不能过问。想作试验，没有原料。他还谈到，去年去河南视察，曾邀集洛阳的一些工厂的非党工程师座谈，很多人都谈到不能了解情况，和党有隔阂。他分析说，过去共产党为了打倒敌人，把剥削阶级当敌人看，是对的，现在情况不同了，但仍把它们当敌人看，不信任。他说，这种绝对观念不取消，共产党就会脱离群众，建设就不会成功。在这种情况下如果指责非党员没有主人翁思想，工作消极，是冤枉的。
    丁贵堂认为正确适当地放手使用非党人士，所谓墙与沟就能不再存在
    丁贵堂说，他认为宗派主义的形成，是由于他们认为自己是特别材料制成的，他们比一般的人优越，看不起非党人士。
    他说，假如有关的一些党员同志能够改变认识，承认非党人士和他们一样同是中国人，也同是有爱国心和正义感的中国人，承认非党人士的政策思想水平虽不如一般党员的高，但数年来经过党的教育和主观努力学习，已有了相当的提高，承认非党人士是衷心热烈地拥护中国共产党，并愿永远跟党走的，承认非党人士是心悦诚服地拥护社会主义和共产主义的事业，并愿意全心全意为人民服务的，总之，如能够承认非党人士是可以完全相信的，正确适当地放手使用他们，则所谓墙与沟就能不再存在了。
    陈建晨不同意章乃器和储安平的某些观点
    陈建晨发言，首先对“放”“鸣”提出自己的看法。她认为现在有不少人怕“收”，也有人想“收”。她认为怕收，没有理由；有人想收，也收不了。种子撒下去，想早收，不行，要等长出谷穗来；硬收会违背人们的意志。
    她认为什么话都可以说，而且可以争辩，“鸣”“放”以后，应当进入明辨是非阶段。她对6月2日人民日报所刊登的章乃器在民建全国工商改造辅导工作座谈会上的讲话，作了分析和批判。她说，章乃器认为“定息不是剥削而是不劳而获的收入”，“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”，“工作上分公私，分党与非党，则工作永远作不好”，“资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但这两个阶级的分子不能说有本质的区别”，这些观点都是错误的。
    她对光明日报总编辑储安平在中共中央统战部召集的座谈会上的发言，“现在国务院的副总理有十二位之多，其中没有一个非党人士，是不是非党人士中没有一人可以坐此交椅？”表示不满。她愤慨地质问说：“我们参加革命的目的难道是为了坐交椅么？”同时她对储安平所谈的联合政府问题也作了批判。她说，在民主革命阶段，毛主席是这样讲过的；但是1954年宪法公布以后就不同了。宪法规定得很清楚，中华人民共和国是以工人阶级领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主的国家，现在是消灭阶级，怎能有阶级联合政府呢？不能把过去的道理搬到今天来用。
    蔡廷锴在发言中谈到他虽然担任了国防委员会的委员、体委副主任和华侨事务委员会委员，但事情不多。他对这一点表示不满。
    苏从周、邵恒秋、刘斐三人也在会上发了言。
