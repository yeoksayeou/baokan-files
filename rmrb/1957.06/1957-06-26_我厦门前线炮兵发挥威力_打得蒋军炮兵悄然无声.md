Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, June 25th. The artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Xiamen area retaliated on the 24th with fierce artillery fire against the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery that had been shelling our coastal villages and ships for days.

　　The battle began at 9:15 a.m. on the 24th and continued intermittently until 6:00 p.m. During this nearly day-long battle, our artillery fired more than 3,000 shells at the enemy-occupied islands of Jinmen, Dadan, and Huzi Islet. These islands immediately billowed with thick smoke and flames. When the wind blew the smoke away, a scene of panic among the enemy was seen: cars darted around everywhere, crowds rolled and crawled, and ambulances came and went continuously. According to preliminary estimates by experienced observers, our artillery destroyed some of the Chiang Kai-shek army's artillery positions and observation posts in this battle.

　　In this battle, the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery fired more than 1,000 shells at our Lianhe area. Our artillery carried out suppression fire against them, and in nearly a day of fierce fighting, silenced the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery on Jinmen Island.

　　我厦门前线炮兵发挥威力
    打得蒋军炮兵悄然无声
    新华社福建前线25日电  中国人民解放军驻厦门地区的炮兵部队，24日以猛烈炮火还击连日炮击我沿海村镇和船只的蒋军炮兵。
    战斗自24日上午九时十五分开始，断断续续直打到下午六时。在这近一天的战斗中，我军炮兵向金门、大担、虎仔屿等敌占岛屿发射了三千多发炮弹。这些岛屿立即腾起浓烟烈火。在风吹烟散的时刻，看到敌人一片慌乱的景象：汽车到处乱窜，人群乱滚乱爬，救护车不断来往。据有经验的观察人员初步估计，在这次战斗中，我军炮兵摧毁了蒋军部分的炮兵阵地和观察所。
    在这次战斗中，蒋军炮兵曾向我莲河地区发炮千发以上。我军炮兵向他们进行了压制射击，在近一天的激战中，把金门岛的蒋军炮兵打得悄然无声。
