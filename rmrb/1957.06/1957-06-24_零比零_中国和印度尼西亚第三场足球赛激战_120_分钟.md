    Zero to Zero
    China and Indonesia's Third Football Match Ends in a Draw After 120 Minutes of Fierce Play
    (Our Dispatch) According to a report from the Central People's Broadcasting Station: The Chinese football team and the Indonesian football team played their third match in Yangon, Burma, on the afternoon of the 23rd. The two sides fiercely contested for one hundred and twenty minutes, but neither side won. In the ninety minutes of intense play, neither side was able to score a goal. The game was extended twice by fifteen minutes, but still no winner emerged, and the score remained at zero to zero.
    From the start of the match, the Chinese team immediately launched a fierce offensive, organizing five or six consecutive attacks in the first few minutes, but failed to score due to the opponent's tight defense. In the last four minutes of the thirty-minute extension, the Chinese team had a powerful shot, but the opponent's goalkeeper, Sa’ilan, was unable to save it, and unfortunately the ball hit the post and bounced out.
    In the 120-minute match, the Chinese team took about forty shots, but the ball either went out of bounds or was saved and caught by the opponent's goalkeeper, Sa'ilan. Our goalkeeper, Zhang Junxiu, also saved many dangerous shots throughout the match.
    The Chinese team's lineup was: Goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu, right back Chen Fulai, center back Wang Defa, left back Wang Kebin, right midfielder Wang Xiwen, left midfielder Zhang Jingtian, right winger Ha Zengguang, right inside forward Sun Fucheng, center forward Zhou Xing, left inside forward Nian Weisi, left winger Wang Lu. Zhang Honggen and Jiang Jiexiang were not fully recovered from injuries sustained in the second match and did not play this time.
    The referee for the match was Burmese international referee Wu Badang.
    In the days leading up to the match, Yangon had been experiencing continuous rain. On the afternoon of the match, the rain turned to sunshine, and although the sun was blazing and the temperature reached 87 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 40,000 people watched the match.
    The Chinese and Indonesian teams each won one of the first two matches. According to the regulations of the International Football Federation, if the third match ends in a draw, the winner will be determined by the number of goals scored. Since the Indonesian team scored one more goal than the Chinese team, they will compete with other Asian and African national football teams for the official competition to participate in next year's World Cup football championship.

    中国和印度尼西亚第三场足球赛激战120分钟
    本报讯　据中央人民广播电台消息：中国足球队同印度尼西亚足球队23日下午在缅甸仰光进行了第三场比赛，双方剧烈争夺了一百二十分钟，未分胜负。在九十分钟的激烈比赛中，双方都未能踢进一球。球赛两度延长十五分钟，仍未分出高低，场上一直保持着零比零的纪录。
    比赛一开始，中国队立即发动了猛烈攻势，在几分钟中，连续组织了五、六次的进攻，但在对方严密的防守下，未能建树。在延长三十分钟中的最后四分钟时，中国队曾有一次猛射，对方守门员萨益兰未及扑救，可惜球中门柱弹出。
    在一百二十分钟的比赛中，中国队约射门四十次，球儿不是越界而出，便是被对方守门员萨益兰扑出和接住。我方守门员张俊秀在全场比赛中，也扑救了不少险球。
    中国队上场的阵容是：守门员张俊秀、右后卫陈复赉、中卫王德发、左后卫王克斌、右前卫王锡文、左前卫张京天、右边锋哈增光、右内锋孙福成、中锋周兴、左内锋年维泗、左边锋王陆。张宏根和姜杰祥因为在第二次比赛中受伤没有痊愈，这次没有上场。
    担任这场比赛的裁判是缅甸的国际裁判员吴巴当。
    比赛的前几天中，仰光连日下雨。比赛当天下午，由雨转晴，虽然烈日当空，气温高达华氏八十七度，仍有四万多人观看了这场比赛。
    中国和印度尼西亚两队在前两场中各胜一场，按照国际足球联合会的规定，第三场如果踢成平局，则按攻进的球计算胜负。由于印度尼西亚队比中国队多得一个球，所以将由他们同亚非地区的其他国家足球队争夺参加明年世界杯足球锦标赛的正式比赛。
