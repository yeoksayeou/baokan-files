Third Visit to the Huai Bei Disaster Area
By Our Correspondent Yu Ming

Women and children floundering in the rolling floodwaters; trees and rooftops filled with people crying for help; grain, clothing, and furniture floating away; fleeing disaster victims endlessly on the road, wandering city streets, selling their children, crying from hunger and cold… This is the true record of what the people in the Huai Bei flood-stricken areas suffered before liberation.

Zhou Hongkui, a 58-year-old farmer from Huaiyuan County, told me that six of his family of eight died while fleeing famine. His parents and brothers all died in other villages. People finally looked forward to a good harvest year, bought some utensils, and the next year the flood came and washed everything away. What could they do when things were washed away and they returned from fleeing the famine? Only borrow money. After they harvested wheat the second year to repay the debt, they were still paupers in the end, so that this old man never even married a wife! The experience of farmer Zhou Liangdeng was similar; he sold his younger sister to someone for a斗 (dǒu) of rice.

Last year, Huai Bei suffered another severe flood. With that terrible impression of the past in my mind, I visited this area twice, when the water was vast and boundless, and when the winter was severely cold and covered with white snow; now, when the farmers are celebrating the wheat harvest, I have come to Huai Bei again.

Last year, when the flood came, thousands of large and small boats appeared on the water, and members of the agricultural cooperatives fought the flood day and night to salvage the wheat; cadres of the Party and the People's Government rushed around to resettle the old, weak, women, and children to higher ground; ships loaded with grain and coal came, and the disaster victims no longer needed to flee famine elsewhere. "Riding out the storm together" was the impression I gained from my first visit.

Early this spring, on a day of heavy snowfall, I arrived at the Fei Guang First Agricultural Cooperative of Cao Lao Ji. When I entered the home of Comrade Zhang Yanan of the Prefectural Committee Work Group (he was originally a county Party secretary), I found the room cold and desolate. His child had been sick for more than a month, but he was busy with work all day and could not find time to take the child to the hospital. His life was so difficult, but when he talked about the affairs of the cooperative, he was full of energy. He said that the grain and coal needed by the disaster victims' families had all been distributed to each household before the snow fell, and cotton quilts and clothing had also been distributed three times to those who needed them. We visited door to door and found that not only had food and fuel been arranged, but also productive work at home on snowy days had been arranged. The cooperative members were all dressed warmly and comfortably; some families ate rice porridge, some mixed sweet potatoes with dry rice; every home was warm and lively, and to be honest, it was much better than Comrade Zhang Yanan's home. More than a dozen farmers gathered in one room, and everyone's life was settled. Their joyful conversation made me forget that I was in the homes of disaster victims in a severely affected area, which is a world of difference compared to the life of fleeing famine, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, freezing to death, and starving to death before liberation!

In early June of this year, when I returned to Huaiyuan County, the farmers were harvesting wheat. In the rolling wheat fields, people cheered. Where did this joy come from? It was exchanged for with the great material strength under the care of the Party and the People's Government! In Huaiyuan County, 203 million catties of grain were harvested last year. The state only collected more than 7 million catties for public grain and unified purchase, while the state transferred more than 189 million catties of grain from other places to supply the county last year. That is to say, half of the county's population survived on state-supplied grain. The state also transferred a large number of improved varieties from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Tianjin, and other places, which is an important foundation for this summer's wheat harvest. Not to mention the grain to relieve the farmers, the grain sold to the farmers was also supplied at the general grain price. As for seeds, the state subsidized the supply. Although they suffered disasters last year, the income of many agricultural cooperative members did not decrease. For example, the Wonan Agricultural Cooperative this summer pre-distributed 1.5 yuan per labor day, the Jianqiang Agricultural Cooperative 1.4 yuan per labor day, and the Fei Guang First Agricultural Cooperative is expected to distribute 1.6 yuan per labor day for the whole year. How can this be compared with the situation after disasters in the past?

Ask the farmers of Huai Bei how much benefit they have received from the state's management of the Huai River? They have probably lost count of the amount of relief grain, funds, and clothing they have received from the state since liberation. Farmer Zhou Liangdeng said that he calculated an account when the large cooperative was established: his family originally had 2.8 mu of land, and 17 mu were distributed during the land reform; the loans from the state every year due to disasters, accumulated over several years, had to be repaid as much as was collected in a normal year. Without eating or using any of it, it would take a full four years to repay. His whole family now not only has enough to eat and use, but also has a surplus of 200 yuan even under the disaster situation last year.

Now, in the boundless wheat fields of Huai Bei, piles of wheat are stacked into mountains, tractors are plowing for the farmers, and combine harvesters are harvesting wheat for the farmers. These scenes made me think of the future happiness of the farmers. One night I asked the farmers, some people say "unified purchase and sales have ruined things," "the Communist Party does not care about the lives of farmers," what do you think? A farmer named Shi Hongxin immediately replied: "Those who say these things are guaranteed not to be poor peasants or farmhands, nor are they middle peasants. They are either landlords, bourgeoisie, or counter-revolutionaries. We farmers can't say such things against our conscience!"

The farmers are very clear about right and wrong! Those who hate socialism, you vainly hope to let the farmers return to the miserable life they had before liberation. (Attached picture)

This year's wheat harvest on both sides of the Huai River is even higher than the bumper year of 1955. Look! The members of the Huaishang Agricultural Cooperative in Fengyang County are packing up these fruitful wheat crops.

### 三访淮北灾区

　　三访淮北灾区
　　本报记者  于明
    妇孺在滚滚大水里翻腾，树枝、屋顶上满是哀哀呼救的人群，粮食、衣服和家具飘走了；逃荒的灾民不绝于途，他们流浪在城市街头，卖儿卖女，啼饥号寒……这就是解放前淮北水灾地区人民遭遇的真情实录。
    怀远县一个五十八岁的农民周鸿魁对我说，他家八口人，逃荒死掉的就有六口人。他的父母和弟兄都死在外乡。人们好容易盼到一个好年景，买了点用具，下一年水来了，就会把什么都冲走。东西冲走了，逃荒回来怎么办？只有借债。到第二年收麦子还了债，到头来还是个穷光蛋，以致这位老人一辈子连个老婆都没有娶成！农民周良登的遭遇也差不多，一斗米就把妹妹卖给了人家。
    去年，淮北又遭了严重涝灾。我怀着过去的那种可怕的印象，在大水茫茫的时候，在严冬白雪皑皑的时候，先后两次访问了这个地区；现在，当农民喜庆小麦丰收的时候，我又来到淮北了。
    去年，当洪水来临的时候，成千上万只大、小船只便出现在水上了，农业社社员们夜以继日地和水害搏斗，打捞小麦；党和人民政府的干部到处奔波，把老弱妇孺安置到高地上去；满载着粮食和煤炭的船只开来了，灾民不需要外出逃荒了。“同舟共济”就是我第一次访问所得的印象。
    今年初春，一个大雪纷飞的日子，我到了曹老集淝光第一农业社。当我走进地委工作组张亚南同志的家里（他原是一个县委书记），发现屋子里冷冷清清，孩子病了一个多月，而他整天忙着工作，不得抽身带孩子到医院里去看一下。他的生活这样艰苦，但是谈到社里的事情却是精神抖擞。他说，灾民家里需要的粮食和煤炭，在下雪以前就都分到各户了，谁家需要棉被棉衣，也已分发过三次。我们挨门挨户的访问，发现不但吃的烧的安排好了，连下雪天在家里的生产活计都安排好了。社员们都穿得严严实实，有的人家吃大米稀饭，有的掺着红薯吃干饭，家里都热气腾腾，说实话，比张亚南同志的家里要好待得多。在一间屋子里聚了十几个农民，各人的生活都有着落。他们快乐的谈笑，使我忘记了是在重灾区的灾民家里，这和解放前逃荒在外，风餐露宿，冻死饿死的生活比较，岂不是天地之别？
    今年6月初，我重新来到怀远县时，农民开镰收麦了。在翻滚的麦浪里，人们欢声载地。这种欢乐，从何而来？是在党和人民政府的关怀下，用巨大的物质力量换来的呵！怀远全县，去年一年收了二亿零三百万斤粮食，国家征公粮和统购的只有七百多万斤，而国家去年从外地调来供应这个县的粮食却有一亿八千九百多万斤。就是说，全县一半人口是靠国家供应粮食活过来的。国家还从四川、陕西、天津等地调运大批良种，这是今年夏季小麦丰收的重要基础。救济农民的粮食就不说了，就是卖给农民的粮食也都按照一般粮价供应的。至于种子，国家贴钱供应。去年受灾，而许多农业社社员的收入并不减少，如涡南农业社今夏预支每个劳动日可分到一元五角，健强农业社每个劳动日可到一元四角，淝光第一农业社全年预计每个劳动日可分到一元六角。这岂能和过去在受灾后的情况相比呢？
    问问淮北农民，国家治理淮河使他们得到了多少利益？他们在解放后，得到国家的救济粮款和衣服，恐怕算都算不清了。农民周良登说，在成立大社时他算过一笔账：他家原有二亩八分地，土地改革时分了十七亩；每年因灾向国家贷的款，几年累计起来，要在一般年成收多少就还多少，一点不吃不用，需要整整还四年才能还得清。他全家人现在不但够吃够用，就是在去年那样的灾情下，还多余了二百元。
    现在，淮北一望无际的麦田里，一垛垛小麦堆成山，拖拉机在代农民夏耕，联合收割机在为农民收麦。这种种景象，使我想到了农民未来的幸福。在一个晚上我问了一下农民，有人说“统购统销搞坏了”，“共产党不关心农民生活”，你们认为怎样？一个叫史红新的农民立刻回答：“讲这些话的，管保不是贫雇农，也不是中农，他们不是地主、资产阶级，就是反革命。我们农民可不能那样昧着良心说话！”
    农民对是非分辨得很清楚！那些仇恨社会主义的人，你们妄想让农民再回到解放前那样悲惨的生活中去。（附图片）
    淮河两岸今年小麦的收成比丰收的1955年还要高。你看！凤阳县淮上农业社的社员们正在收拾这些丰硕的麦子。
