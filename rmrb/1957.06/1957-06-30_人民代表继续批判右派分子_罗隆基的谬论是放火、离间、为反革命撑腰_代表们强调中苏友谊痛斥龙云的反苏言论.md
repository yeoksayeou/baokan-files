Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: Representatives attending the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued to criticize the anti-socialist fallacies of rightists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at group meetings held this morning. Many representatives, while refuting Long Yun's anti-Soviet slanders, unanimously emphasized the need to further strengthen the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

The Jiangxi Province delegation has been resolutely criticizing Luo Longji's mistakes and his attitude towards his mistakes in recent days. At the group meetings on the 27th and this morning, Luo Longji made two speeches. The representatives believed that his speeches at the group meetings were rambling "replies" that deviated from the topic and specific facts, and were therefore very dissatisfied with him.

The representatives pointed out that Luo Longji insisted that he had not used the words "Rehabilitation Committee" in his speech at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and that the newspapers published his speech differently, and that he "casually did not carefully read the reporter's稿件" before the newspapers published it. The representatives said that Luo Longji was trying to play with words to defend his mistakes, but in fact his mistakes were programmatic and could not be denied. According to reporters, Luo Longji's speech draft had not only been read by himself in advance, but also had many revisions made in his own handwriting.

Representative Chen Qihan criticized Luo Longji for quibbling. Chen Qihan pointed out that Luo Longji still does not want to stand on the people's position to expose his own problems. His reactionary remarks actually played a very bad role, which is "the role of arson, the role of division, and the role of supporting counter-revolutionary elements."

Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, presented specific materials at the meeting to illustrate the bad influence of Luo Longji's reactionary remarks about the "Rehabilitation Committee". Yao Yilin said that from the perspective of the Ministry of Commerce, Luo Longji's proposal of the "Rehabilitation Committee" has a certain market. He said that a few people in the Ministry of Commerce supported Luo Longji's "Rehabilitation Committee." They posted big-character posters in response to Luo Longji, opposed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, demanded that the "Rehabilitation Committee" not be participated in by party organizations and those engaged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, attacked activists, were dissatisfied with the socialist system, and hated the people's regime, and their arrogance was very rampant. Yao Yilin said that the leader of these people was a person who had been sentenced in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and had been a spy twice in history. Yao Yilin said that Luo Longji's remarks were responded to by Taiwan, and were responded to by counter-revolutionary elements and those who were dissatisfied with the socialist system. He is using the name of rectification to engage in anti-communist activities. Luo Longji must thoroughly examine and completely strip himself bare.

Zhang Bojun attended the Anhui Province delegation meeting for the first time today. He perfunctorily made empty "self-criticism" without touching on the essence of his thoughts and his anti-socialist activities. The representatives criticized his attitude and asked him to thoroughly explain to the people.

In today's and yesterday's discussions, many representatives from the Shaanxi, Liaoning, Shanxi, Shanghai, Shandong and other delegations emphasized the importance of strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship in their speeches, and refuted Long Yun's anti-Soviet remarks. The representatives cited examples of the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to China in industry, agriculture, science, and other fields, and explained that without the Soviet Union's assistance, China's construction cause could not have achieved such significant achievements. Some representatives from Shanxi Province pointed out that the rightists' attempt to undermine Sino-Soviet friendship is to undermine China's construction cause. Some representatives from Shaanxi Province said that the unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and this unity and friendship cannot be shaken by anyone.

　　Guangxi Representatives Describe the Suffering Before Liberation
    Denounce Huang Shaohong for Forgetting the Guangxi People's Forgiveness of Him

The representatives of the Guangxi group criticized Huang Shaohong for forgetting the Guangxi people's forgiveness of him. They said that Huang Shaohong has consistently downplayed achievements and exaggerated shortcomings in the past few years. He inspected judicial, agricultural, and educational work in Guangxi and believed that everything was terrible. He raised seven major shortcomings in the education department of Guilin, saying that it was worse than the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Representatives of ethnic minorities, Li Ming, Lan Changfa, Chen Jiyi, etc., all used the suffering of ethnic minorities before liberation to criticize Huang Shaohong's absurd remarks. They said that Huang Shaohong has historically been anti-communist and anti-people. Before liberation, he killed many outstanding sons and daughters in Guangxi who resisted the rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, he joined the People's Government and expressed his willingness to sincerely repent and serve the people. The people of Guangxi forgave him and elected him as a representative to the National People's Congress. However, he violated the will of the people, insisted on the reactionary position of opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, which is intolerable.

　　Many Representatives Say China's Elections are Truly Democratic Elections
    The Rightists' Conspiracy is to Deprive the Working People of Their Rights

Many representatives from Beijing, Liaoning, Overseas Chinese, Shaanxi, and other representative groups used specific facts to refute the rightists' fallacy of "undemocratic elections" today.

Representatives Lao She, Le Songsheng, Zhang Youyu and others from the Beijing delegation pointed out that China's elections are truly democratic elections, mainly reflected in the fact that elections are repeatedly consulted by various democratic parties, and fully deliberated among voters to ensure that representatives from all strata and ethnic groups are elected. They said that otherwise, it would be difficult for rightists such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi to be elected as people's representatives. Now, these rightists want to engage in a bicameral system and insist that our elections are undemocratic. In fact, what they are pursuing is the false democratic system of capitalist countries, depriving the broad working people of their right to be masters of their own affairs. Lao She, who had personally witnessed various facts about the bourgeois parliament in the United Kingdom and the United States, said that members of parliament in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are supported by capitalists, and they must pay a large deposit before running for election. After being elected, they only follow the interests of the capitalists, and the poor can be representatives. Liaoning representatives and labor models Shi Yuhai, Li Xikui, and others introduced the facts of their exploitation and oppression in the old society. They said that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the working people truly be the masters of the country and truly enjoy the rights of democracy and freedom. Shi Yuhai said that the rightists say that our country is not democratic. If it is not democratic, can we, the working people, be here to discuss state affairs? Overseas Chinese representative Wu Hengxing said that China's democratic centralism is the true democracy of the broad masses of the people. The so-called democracy in capitalist countries is actually false democracy. He personally saw in capitalist countries that big capitalists can use money to buy votes, and the working people cannot talk about democracy at all.

### 人民代表继续批判右派分子  罗隆基的谬论是放火、离间、为反革命撑腰  代表们强调中苏友谊痛斥龙云的反苏言论

　　人民代表继续批判右派分子
    罗隆基的谬论是放火、离间、为反革命撑腰
    代表们强调中苏友谊痛斥龙云的反苏言论
    新华社29日讯　出席全国人民代表大会第四次会议的代表们，在今天上午举行的小组会上，许多小组继续批判了章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子反社会主义的谬论。许多代表在驳斥龙云的反苏谰言时，一致强调要进一步加强中苏的伟大友谊。
    江西省代表小组连日来对罗隆基的错误和他对自己错误所采取的态度，进行了坚决的批判。在27日和今天上午的小组会上，罗隆基作了两次发言。代表们认为他在小组会上的发言是离开本题、离开具体事实的夸夸其谈的“答复”，因此对他非常不满。
    代表们指出，罗隆基硬说他在中共中央统战部座谈会上的发言没有用过“平反委员会”的字样，而且说各报发表他的发言都不一样，报纸发表之前他“马马虎虎，没有仔细看过记者的稿件”。代表们说，罗隆基企图玩弄字句为他的错误辩解，其实他的错误是带有纲领性的东西，是抵赖不了的。据记者证实，罗隆基的发言稿事先不仅经过他本人看过，并且亲笔作了很多修改。
    代表陈奇涵批评罗隆基狡辩。陈奇涵指出，罗隆基到现在还不想站在人民立场上来揭发自己的问题。他的反动言论实际起了很坏的作用，这就是“放火的作用、离间的作用、给反革命分子撑腰的作用”。
    商业部副部长姚依林在会上提出具体材料，说明罗隆基的“平反委员会”的反动言论所起的恶劣影响。姚依林说，从商业部的机关来看，罗隆基的“平反委员会”的主张是有一部分市场的。他说，商业部有少数几个人拥护罗隆基的“平反委员会”。他们贴大字报响应罗隆基，他们反对肃反运动，要求“平反委员会”不要党组织和搞肃反运动的人参加，他们攻击积极分子，他们对社会主义的制度不满，对人民的政权仇恨，气焰非常嚣张。姚依林说，在这些人中为首的一个就是在镇反运动中被判过刑的历史上干过两次特务的人。姚依林说，罗隆基的言论得到了台湾的响应，得到反革命分子和对社会主义制度心怀不满的人的响应。他在假借整风之名，行其反共之实。罗隆基必须彻底检查，彻底脱裤子。
    章伯钧今天第一次参加安徽省代表小组会。他敷敷衍衍地作了空洞的“自我批判”，没有接触思想实质和他反社会主义的活动。代表们批评他这种态度，要他彻底向人民交代。
    在今天和昨天的讨论中，陕西、辽宁、山西、上海、山东等代表小组许多代表在发言中，都强调加强中苏友谊的重要性，驳斥了龙云的反苏言论。代表们举出苏联在工业、农业、科学等方面对我国的真诚无私的援助的事例，说明没有苏联的援助，我国建设事业不可能取得这样重大的成就。山西省有的代表指出，右派分子企图破坏中苏友谊，就是为了破坏我国的建设事业。陕西省有的代表说，中苏两国人民的团结和友谊是牢不可破的，这种团结和友谊是任何人也动摇不了的。
　　广西代表诉说解放前所受的苦难
    斥责黄绍竑忘记了广西人民对他的宽恕
    广西小组的代表们批评黄绍竑忘记了广西人民对他的宽恕。他们说，黄绍竑几年来一贯抹煞成绩，夸大缺点。他在广西视察过司法、农业和教育工作，认为都是糟得很。他对桂林的教育部门提出了七大缺点，说比国民党反动统治时期还不如。少数民族代表黎明、蓝昌法、陈基义等都以少数民族解放前受到的苦难，批驳黄绍竑的荒谬言论。他们说，黄绍竑在历史上一贯反共、反人民。解放前他在广西杀害了许多反抗国民党统治的优秀儿女。解放后他参加了人民政府，表示要虔诚悔过为人民服务，广西人民宽恕了他，并且选他为全国人民代表大会代表。但是，他违反了人民的意愿，坚持反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的反动立场，这是不能容忍的。
　　许多代表说我国的选举是真正的民主选举
    右派分子的阴谋是想剥夺劳动人民的权利
    北京、辽宁、华侨、陕西等代表小组今天有许多代表用具体事实驳斥右派分子所谓“选举不民主”的谬论。
    北京市代表小组老舍、乐松生和张友渔等代表指出，我国的选举是真正的民主选举，主要体现在选举时都经各民主党派反复协商，又在选民中充分酝酿，保证各阶层各民族都有代表当选。他们说，不然，像章伯钧、罗隆基和章乃器等人是很难当选为人民代表的。现在，这些右派分子要搞两院制，硬说我们的选举不民主，实际上他们所追求的是资本主义国家的假民主制度，剥夺广大劳动人民当家做主的权利。曾经在英美两国亲眼见到资产阶级议会种种事实的老舍说，英美等国家的议员都有资本家支持，要竞选需先交大批押金，当选后唯资本家的利益是从，穷人那能当代表。辽宁代表、劳动模范施玉海、李锡奎等介绍他们在旧社会遭受剥削、压迫的事实，他们说，只有在共产党领导下，劳动人民才真正做了国家的主人，真正享受了民主自由的权利。施玉海说，右派分子说我们国家不民主，如果不民主，我们这些劳动人民能在这里开会讨论国家大事吗？华侨代表吴恒兴说，我国的民主集中制，是广大人民的真正的民主。资本主义国家的所谓民主，实际上是假民主。他在资本主义国家里亲眼看到，大资本家可以用钱买选票，劳动人民根本就谈不上什么民主。
