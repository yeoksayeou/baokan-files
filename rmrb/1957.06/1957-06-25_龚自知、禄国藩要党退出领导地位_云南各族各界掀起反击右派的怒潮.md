　　Gong Zizhi, Lu Guofan Demand the Party Withdraw from Leading Position
    Yunnan's Various Ethnic Groups and Circles Unleash a Tide of Anger Against the Rightists

    (Our dispatch) Since June 15th, a massive movement of people from all ethnic groups and circles in Yunnan Province against right-wing statements has reached its climax. In the preceding period, rightists Gong Zizhi, Lu Guofan, and others, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work, viciously slandered socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party at the seventeen symposiums convened by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC and the ten symposiums convened by the various departments of the Provincial and Municipal Committees. Gong Zizhi, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, proposed that, except for one article, the Constitution does not mention the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, he demanded that in the future, "the Party should be placed in a more detached position." Lu Guofan, Director of the Counselor's Office of the Provincial People's Committee, said: The current government is like a deaf man's ear, existing in name only, with all the Party members issuing orders. He advocated that we should not talk about dictatorship or non-dictatorship now; in the future, the Party should hide "behind the scenes" and direct, and not come forward in person. He also said that today's provincial governor is more bureaucratic than the chairman of the Kuomintang government. After these anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks were made, they aroused the anger of people from all walks of life. Since June 9th, people from all walks of life in Yunnan have risen up to refute the anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership statements. More than 1,700 representatives of workers from 78 factories and mining enterprises in Kunming City gathered to pledge to safeguard the achievements of socialist construction with practical actions.

    Liu Han, an old worker from Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, said at a meeting attended by more than 1,700 people: Gong Zizhi wants to put the Communist Party in a "detached" position, which we workers resolutely oppose! Our factory has increased iron production by more than 49 times using the original equipment because of the leadership of the Party. The steel rolling workshop can produce what used to take a year to produce before liberation in just three days. Isn't this the superiority of socialism? Shop assistant Cui Pinhua said in an article questioning Lu Guofan: Before liberation, I lived a miserable shop assistant life for twenty-five years. We were beaten by Long Yun's subordinates and beaten by Lu Guofan's subordinates, but we had nowhere to reason. After liberation, we lived like human beings, but Lu Guofan said that it was better then than now, and that our leaders are more bureaucratic than Long Yun. Only those who used to bully and oppress people would have such a view!

    Many minority workers said at the symposium that we minority nationalities especially cherish the leadership of the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no ethnic equality today, no ethnic unity, and no socialist family of the motherland.

    More than 800 students of Yunnan Institute for Nationalities, including more than 20 ethnic groups, also condemned the reactionary remarks of Gong Zizhi and others. Lisu student Qu Luwo recalled the tragic life of his people in the past at a symposium. He said, we now have food, clothing, and opportunities to study culture. Whoever says the Party is not good, whoever says socialism is not good, is preventing our minority people from living a good life, and we must resolutely fight them! Many minority students listed the facts of improved lives, questioned the basis of Gong Zizhi's fallacies, and said: You want the Party to be "detached," to retreat "behind the scenes," then who wants to sneak to the "front" secretly?

    Farmers of all ethnic groups were particularly angry about the so-called "starving people" and the remarks that things were not as good as before liberation. Li Neng, from Shangsuo Cooperative in Jinning County, listed dozens of facts in a row to reason with Gong Zizhi and others. He said indignantly: Whoever wants to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, we farmers will bury them with a shovel of soil each! Ruan Ziyun, the head of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Kunming City, exposed Gong Zizhi's long-standing reactionary stance. He also said: When Gong Zizhi came to our cooperative to inspect, he did not care about the living conditions of the majority of farmers, but went to collect information about a few landlord elements, trying to use this to accuse us of living worse than before.

    Subsequently, farmers, intellectuals, government cadres, citizens, and within the various democratic parties, all expressed that they would draw a clear ideological line with the reactionary remarks of the rightists and severely condemn those rightists who attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Party and destroy socialism.

　　龚自知、禄国藩要党退出领导地位
    云南各族各界掀起反击右派的怒潮
    本报讯　云南省一个声势浩大的各族各界人士反击右派言论的运动，从6月15日以来，进入高潮。在前一段时间里，右派分子龚自知、禄国藩等人，在中共云南省委召开的十七次座谈会及省、市委各部召开的十次座谈会上，假借帮助党整风，恶毒地诬蔑社会主义和共产党的领导。民革云南省委主委龚自知提出，在宪法中除一条以外，没有提到共产党的领导，因此，他要求今后“让党处于比较超然的地位”。省人民委员会参事室主任禄国藩说：现在的政府等于聋子耳朵，有名无实，全是党员在那里发号施令。他主张现在不要说那个专政不专政，今后党应躲在“幕后”指挥，不能亲自出马。他并且说，今天的省长比国民党政府的主席还官僚。这些反党反社会主义的言论发表后，引起了各界人士的愤怒。从6月9日以来，云南各界群起反驳反社会主义、反对党的领导的言论。昆明市七十八个厂矿企业单位的职工代表一千七百多人集会，誓以实际行动捍卫社会主义建设成果。
    昆明钢铁厂老工人刘汉在一次有一千七百多人参加的集会上说：龚自知要让共产党处于“超然”的地位，我们工人坚决反对！我们厂就是由于有了党的领导，利用原有设备就把铁产量提高了四十九倍多，轧钢车间只要三天的时间，就能生产解放前一年才能生产的产品，这难道不是社会主义的优越性吗？店员崔品华在一篇质问禄国藩的文章中说：解放前，我过了二十五年的惨痛店员生活，我们挨过龙云部下的打，挨过禄国藩部下的打，但那时我们没有说理的地方。解放后，我们才活得像个人，可是禄国藩却说那时比现在还好，说我们的首长比龙云还官僚，只有当年作威作福的人，才会有这样看法！
    许多少数民族工人在座谈会上说，我们少数民族特别珍视共产党的领导权，没有党的领导，就没有今天的民族平等，就没有民族团结，就没有社会主义的祖国大家庭。
    包括二十多种民族的八百多名云南民族学院的学员也纷纷斥责龚自知等人的反动言论。傈僳族学员曲路我在一次座谈会上回忆了过去本民族人民的悲惨生活。他说，我们今天才有了吃，有了穿，有了学文化的机会，谁说党不好，谁说社会主义不好，就是不让我们少数民族人民过好日子，我们就要坚决同他们斗争！许多少数民族学生列举了生活改善的事实，质问龚自知的谬论有何根据，并说：你们要党“超然”，要党退到“幕后”，那么谁想偷偷摸摸地挤到“幕前”来呢？
    各族农民对于所谓“饿死人”和不如解放前好的言论特别感到气愤。晋宁县上蒜社李能一连列举了几十件事实，来和龚自知等人辩理，他愤慨地说：谁要想推翻共产党的领导，我们农民就要一人一铲土把他们埋葬掉！昆明市先锋农业社社长阮自云揭露了龚自知由来已久的反动立场。他并说：龚自知到我们社里来视察时，不去关心大多数农民的生活情况，却去搜集少数地主分子的情况，企图以此来指责我们农民的生活不如以前好。
    继而，农民、知识界、机关干部、市民以及各民主党派内部，纷纷表示要同右派的反动言论划清思想界限，严厉谴责那些企图推翻党的领导、毁灭社会主义的右派分子。
