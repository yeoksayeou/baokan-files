Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th—Rong Yiren spoke yesterday at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee's Office for the Transformation of Capitalists on the issue of class relations and criticism and self-criticism. He affirmed that the Chinese national bourgeoisie still possessed a dual character, but that the dual character itself was in the process of changing. He said: "The positive aspect is evolving from patriotism to a willingness to serve socialism; the negative aspect is evolving from a demand for unlimited exploitation to a fixed interest, limited degree of exploitation. From these situations, it can be seen that the positive aspects are constantly growing, and the negative aspects are constantly shrinking. But we absolutely cannot deny the existence of duality."

Rong Yiren said: "Today we demand that other classes see that we have a negative side, but also see that we have a positive side, and that the positive side is constantly growing, and the bourgeois elements are also changing." He said: "I understand that most of the Chinese bourgeois elements have already shed their old skin, but the bone change has not yet been completed. Is there pain? There is a certain amount of pain. Is it very pleasant? There is considerable pleasure. We are transforming in pain and pleasure. Are we somewhat reluctant to part with the past? Yes. Is it possible to give up the past? Yes. We are willing to serve socialism today."

Rong Yiren said that for the national bourgeoisie to transform into members of the working class, it is not a matter of the working class accommodating them, but rather the national bourgeois elements changing their own thoughts and feelings to those of the working class. In this transformation process, there can be no antagonistic emotions. Antagonism is only detrimental to self-reform and detrimental to serving socialism.

Speaking of criticism and self-criticism, he expressed opposition to the "only criticism allowed, no self-criticism allowed" situation that had appeared in some areas. He said that we should make good use of the formula of unity – criticism – unity. The criticism in the middle includes self-criticism. If only criticism is allowed and no self-criticism is allowed, then there can be no unity on a new basis. Without debate, there cannot be correct criticism.

Rong Yiren then criticized certain arguments. He opposed the statement that the government "only values ​​the wealth of those with capital, not the talent of those without capital" in the arrangement of private personnel. He cited some specific examples to show that the arrangements did indeed take into account the technical experience of private personnel and did not only look at the amount of their property, so this criticism was not based on specific facts. He also refuted the erroneous remarks of not wanting the leadership of the Communist Party. He believes that the facts of the past eight years have proved that the Communist Party's political and economic policies are correct. There are shortcomings in the work, but this cannot prove that the system is not good and that the Party's leadership is not needed.

　　荣毅仁说：资产阶级在改造过程中不能有对立的情绪
    据新华社上海11日电  荣毅仁昨天在中共上海市委统战部和市人民委员会对资改造办公室召开的座谈会上谈到阶级关系和批评反批评的问题。他肯定地认为中国民族资产阶级还有两面性，但两面性本身在变化中。他说：“积极的方面从爱国到愿意为社会主义服务；消极的方面从要求无限制剥削到定息的有限度的剥削。从这些情况可以看出，积极性在不断增长，消极性在不断缩小。但我们绝对不能否认两面性的存在。”
    荣毅仁说：“今天我们要求其他阶级看到我们有消极的一面，也要看到有积极的一面，而且积极的一面是不断增长的，资产阶级分子也在变化中。”他说：“我理解中国的资产阶级分子大部分已经脱胎，但换骨尚未换好。是不是有痛苦？有一定的痛苦。是不是很愉快？有相当的愉快。我们就是在痛苦和愉快中转变。是不是对过去有些恋恋不舍？有。是不是对过去可以放弃？可以。我们今天愿为社会主义服务。”
    荣毅仁说，民族资产阶级要转化为工人阶级成员，不是要工人阶级迁就，而是要民族资产阶级分子把自己的思想改变为工人阶级的思想感情。在这种转变过程中，不能有对立的情绪，对立只有对自我改造不利，对社会主义服务不利。
    他谈到批评与反批评时，对某些方面出现的“只许批评不许反批评”的情况表示反对。他说，我们应该很好运用团结——批评——团结的公式。这中间的批评就包括反批评在内。只许批评不许反批评，就不能在新的基础上团结。不许争论，不可能有正确的批评。
    荣毅仁接着对某些论调提出了批评。他反对有人批评政府在私方人员安排中“只重有贝之财，不重无贝之才”的说法。他举出一些具体例子，说明安排中的确是考虑到私方人员的技术经验的，并不只看他的财产多少，因此这种批评并非从具体事实出发的。他还驳斥了不要共产党领导的错误言论。他认为八年来的事实证明，共产党的政治经济政策是正确的，工作上有缺点，但不能因而证明制度不好，不要党的领导。
