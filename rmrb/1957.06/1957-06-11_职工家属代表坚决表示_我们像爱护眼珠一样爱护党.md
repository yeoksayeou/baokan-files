　　(Reported by our newspaper) Yesterday and the day before, the representatives attending the National Workers' Family Representatives Conference in Beijing held consecutive symposiums. Wang Hongcai, a representative of the Tianjin delegation, spoke, saying: We saw the news that Lu Yuwen received a threatening letter, which aroused the anger of all the representatives. We will never allow any bad elements and people with ulterior motives to insult the Party or write threatening letters to those who support the Communist Party. Today's world belongs to the people. This despicable Kuomintang secret agent tactic will not work.
　　Nalengqimuge, a Mongolian representative from the Inner Mongolia grasslands, said: We, all ethnic groups, cherish the Party as we cherish the pupils of our eyes. Whoever scolds the Party is scolding all of our ethnic groups, and we will never allow it. She said that before liberation, both my husband and I herded cattle for others, without enough to eat or wear. After liberation, the number of sheep in my family has increased fivefold compared to before liberation, and we live a very good life. State-owned farms have been established on our grasslands, and farming machines have appeared. My husband has also become the head of the farm. Yet Ge Peiqi insists on saying that "people's lives have not improved," which is simply absurd.
　　Gao Fengqin, a worker's family representative from Liaoning Province and a representative to the National People's Congress, said: Ge Peiqi said, "If the Communist Party is gone, China will not be gone." This is nonsense. Even a three-year-old child knows that "without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." I am from the Northeast and suffered as a slave under the puppet Manchukuo regime. Only the Communist Party liberated us from the status of slaves and made us masters of the country.

　　职工家属代表坚决表示
　　我们像爱护眼珠一样爱护党
    本报讯  前天和昨天，正在北京参加全国职工家属代表会议的代表们，连续举行了座谈会。王洪才代表天津市代表团发言。她说：我们看到了卢郁文接到恐吓信的消息，激起了全体代表的愤怒，我们决不允许任何坏分子和别有用心的人辱骂党，向拥护共产党的人写恐吓信，今天的天下是人民的天下，这种卑鄙的国民党特务手法行不通了。
    来自内蒙古草原的蒙古族代表那楞其木格说：我们各族人民像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护党。谁骂党，就是骂我们各族人民，我们决不允许。她说，解放前，我和我的爱人都给人放牛，吃不饱，穿不暖；解放后，我家的羊比解放前增加了五倍，生活过得很好。在我们草原上，成立了国营农场，出现了耕种的机器，我的爱人还当了场长。而葛佩琦偏偏要说“人民生活没有提高”，这种话真是荒谬之至。
    辽宁省职工家属代表、全国人民代表大会代表高凤琴说：葛佩琦说：“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”，这是胡说，三岁小孩也知道“没有共产党就没有新中国”；我是东北人，在伪满统治的时候，吃过当亡国奴的苦头。只有共产党才把我们从亡国奴的地位解放了出来，使我们成了国家的主人。
