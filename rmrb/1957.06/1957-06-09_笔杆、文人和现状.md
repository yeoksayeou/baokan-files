Penholders, Literati, and the Status Quo
    Hé Míng

    A few days ago, at a debate in a university, I heard a young person say: "Dissatisfaction with the status quo is a virtue of youth." I was a bit confused; what kind of status quo was she dissatisfied with?

    Recently, reading the newspaper, I saw Mr. Yang Yuqing say: "The pen of a literati is naturally against the status quo, a true literati is against the status quo, and good articles have been against the status quo since ancient times." Those who oppose the status quo are "people of benevolence and lofty ideals"; those who "sing praises" are not worth mentioning. This time, I was even more confused; my head was dizzy, my eyes blurred, and a large number of "true" literati appeared before me, wearing hats of nothingness, dressed in clothes of nothingness, sitting on chairs of nothingness, lying on desks of nothingness, wielding a hairy pen, and writing their good articles. I quietly walked over to take a look, and the topics they were doing were all "against the status quo"; the opening line was: "Those against the status quo are those who oppose the status quo." Unfortunately, I couldn't recognize a single word underneath, probably because it was celestial script! I was wondering when suddenly several literati picked up inkstones and slammed them at my head; and one shouted sharply: "Kill this scoundrel who steals the secrets of heaven!" I ran quickly and fell.

    The "true" literati in front of me disappeared, leaving only myself in a daze.

    After being in a daze for a while, I picked up the newspaper again and looked at it, drilling left and right, but still unable to comprehend this gentleman's wonderful theory of "opposing the status quo." There was no other way, I had to ask for instructions from "dogma":

    A pen has no class nature; but it cannot write articles by itself.

    People have class nature in class society; a literati is first a person, then a literati, and if he can't lift himself up to the sky by his own hair, he probably also has class nature.

    As for the status quo? I don't know what kind of status quo the "people of benevolence and lofty ideals" are against? Imperialists are also "heroes" against the status quo, and they are desperately trying to reverse the status quo of the communist world. The Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan are also desperately against the status quo, trying to reverse the status quo of the People's Republic of China existing proudly. I wonder if they and their literati can produce good articles? Can they be considered "people of benevolence and lofty ideals"?

    In the final analysis, the question is: What class standpoint do you stand on? What kind of status quo are you against? What kind of status quo are you protecting or what are you striving for?

    Only opposing, opposing everything, protecting nothing, striving for nothing, and even less singing praises—this is a lie or nonsense. In fact, with opposition there must be support, with eradication there must be protection, and with exposure there must be praise. Opposing white, isn't it supporting non-white? Opposing both white and non-white, isn't it supporting nothingness? And "nothingness" is paving the way for another kind of "existence."...

    A loud shout in my ear: "Hey! Don't give me a political lesson, I'm here to cure your illness!"—It turned out that I had fallen into the second chapter of confusion again.

    This time I was in the hospital, standing in front of a doctor. Our "goals" were the same. I was asking her to help me oppose my "status quo." So I had to listen to her instructions.

    "This doctor is known for her works on opposing the status quo. Your basic status quo is being alive, and secondly, carrying germs. So..." As she spoke, she flashed a bright scalpel—"We should eliminate your basic status quo; then, you will be eternally and absolutely healthy!" Without explanation, she wielded the knife and stabbed at my throat.

    This scare made me understand:

    It turned out that her goals and mine were not the same, did she have a grudge against me? Or, she was a patient with a very bad "status quo," talking nonsense with a high fever.

    笔杆、文人和现状
    何明
    前些天，在一个高等学校的辩论会上，听到一位青年说：“不满现状是青年人的美德。”我有些糊涂；她不满的倒底是何种现状呢？
    近日读报，见到一位杨玉清先生说：“文人的笔杆天然是反现状的，真正的文人是反现状的，从古以来好文章都是反现状的”。反现状者“仁人志士”也；“歌功颂德”者不足道也。——这回，我更糊涂了；头脑发昏，眼睛发花，面前出现了大批“真正的”文人，头戴虚无帽，身穿虚无衣，坐下虚无椅，伏在虚无案，挥动着一枝有毛的笔，大做其好文章。我悄悄地走过去一瞧，他们做的题目都是“反现状”；破题一句都是：“反现状者，反对现状之谓也”。可惜，底下的字我一个也不认得，大概是天书吧！我正在纳闷，突然有几位文人拿起砚池猛地向我头上打来；还有一位厉声高喊：“杀死这个偷看天机的坏蛋！”我赶紧跑，摔了一跤。
    面前的“真正的”文人不见了，只剩下我自己发昏。
    发了一阵昏，再拿起报纸来看，左钻右研还是不能领会这位先生的“反现状”的妙论。没有法子，我还得请教“教条”：
    笔，没有阶级性；可它自己不会做文章。
    人，在阶级社会里是有阶级性的；文人，首先是人，然后是文人，如果他也不能拔着自己的头发飞上天，大概也得有阶级性。
    现状呢？我不知道“仁人志士”们反对是哪种现状？帝国主义也是反现状的“英雄”，他们拚命要把共产主义世界这部分现状反掉。台湾的国民党反动派也在拚命地反现状，要把中华人民共和国巍然存在这种现状反掉。他们和他们的文人，不知能不能做出好文章来？算得算不得“仁人志士”？
    归根结底，问题是：站在什么阶级立场？反的是何种现状？保护的是何种现状或争取的是什么？
    只反对，反对一切，任甚也不保护，不争取，更不歌颂——这是谎话或昏话。其实，有反对必有所赞助，有铲除必有所保护，有暴露必有所歌颂。反对白，岂不是赞助非白？连白和非白一起反对，岂不是赞助虚无？而“虚无”是给另一种“有”开辟道路的。……
    耳边一声高喊：“咄！你不要给我上政治课，我是给你治病的！——原来我又跌进了发昏第二章。
    这回是在医院里，我站在一位医生的面前。我俩的“目标”是一致的。我是请她帮助我反对我的“现状”的。所以只好听她的吩咐。
    “本大夫是以反现状论著称的。你的基本现状是活着，其次是带有病菌。所以……”她说着就亮出了一把明晃晃的手术刀——“应该消灭你的基本现状；那，您就永远的绝对的健康了！”不由分说，她操刀向我的咽喉刺来。
    这一吓，倒把我吓明白了：
    原来她和我的目标是不一致的，她跟我有仇吧？要不，她就是一个“现状”很坏的病人，发着高烧在说胡话。
