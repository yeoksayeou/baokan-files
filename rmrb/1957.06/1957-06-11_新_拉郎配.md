New "Forced Marriage"
　　Dong Dai
Characters: Zhao Jia, Qian Yi, Sun Bing, Li Ding.
Scene:
    The office of the editorial committee of a literary magazine in a certain city.
Time: A certain month in 1956

　　Zhao Jia: Some people say that our magazine is weak in ideological content, lacks combat effectiveness, and suppresses new forces. What do you think is the key issue?
　　Qian Yi: In my opinion, these are just a few intimidating labels.
　　Sun Bing: (Looked at everyone, but did not speak)
　　Li Ding: Let me talk about my opinion. I think the main problem lies in the direction of the publication, that is to say, the standard for examining our publication should be whether it conforms to the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
　　Qian Yi: (Took off his glasses, pushed aside a manuscript of a novel on hand, and looked at Li Ding, to see how he would pin this new label.)
　　Zhao Jia: (Muttering) Direction! Hmm, direction.
　　Li Ding: (Sweeping his eyes around) To be honest, if you adjust the composition of the editorial board appropriately, it will change.
　　Qian Yi: (Surprised) Oh...
　　Li Ding: For example, (Lowering his voice, no longer sounding like giving a speech) writers Zhou Gong, Wu Nong, and Zheng Bing have been tempered by revolution for a long time and have always adhered to the literary direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. If they are invited to join the editorial board, then...then... (Suddenly his words were interrupted by a burst of laughter.)
　　Qian Yi: So that's how it is. (The whole room falls silent, curtain falls quickly)

　　新“拉郎配”
　　董代
    登场人物：赵甲，钱乙，孙丙，李丁。
    场景：
    某市一个文艺杂志的编辑委员
    会办公室内。
    时间：1956年某月
　　赵甲：有人说我们的杂志思想性薄弱，战斗性不强，又压制新生力量，你们说到底关键在哪里？
　　钱乙：我看，这不过是几顶吓人的帽子。
　　孙丙：（望了望大家，没有发言）
　　李丁：我谈谈我的意见，我认为主要问题还在于刊物的方向问题，也就是说检查我们刊物的标准，就是要看是不是合乎工农兵方向。
　　钱乙：（把眼镜脱下来，把手边的一 份小说稿推开一些，望了望李丁，看他这顶新帽子如何扣下来。）
　　赵甲：（喃喃）方向！嗯，方向。
　　李丁：（把眼神向周围横扫了一下）说老实话，如果你们把刊物的编委成分适当调整一下，那就会改观的。
　　钱乙：（一惊）噢……
　　李丁：比如，（把声音放轻下来，不大像发表演说的样子了）周工、武农和郑兵三位作家，都是久经革命锻炼，一向坚持工农兵文艺方向的，如果请他们参加了编委，哪……哪……（忽然话到此被一串笑声打断了。）
　　钱乙：原来是这样。（全场  默然，幕急下）
