Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 12th: According to a report from the German News Agency on the 11th, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, published an article stating that banning atomic weapons for German troops, prohibiting the storage of atomic weapons in Germany, and establishing a zone of arms reduction in Europe would be the first steps in preparing for German reunification.

　　The "Neues Deutschland" recently published an article titled "Ulbricht Responds to Adenauer," written by Ulbricht on the Bonn government's memorandum to the Soviet government regarding the German question.

　　In the article, Ulbricht also stated that the Adenauer government is unwilling to acknowledge that German reunification is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. The German Democratic Republic is a sovereign state, and no other country can decide the future of Germany without its consent. He emphasized: "If the West German government abandons its militarist policy, then rapprochement and cooperation between the two German governments are possible."

　　Ulbricht believes that broad discussions and exchanges of views should be conducted among the people of West Germany regarding the suggestions of the 30th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the National Front of Democratic Germany.

　　乌布利希答复阿登纳
　　主张以禁止用原子武器装备德军
　　作为准备统一德国的第一个步骤
    新华社柏林12日电  据德意志通讯社11日讯：德国统一社会党第一书记乌布利希发表文章说：禁止用原子武器装备德国军队、禁止在德国存放原子武器以及在欧洲建立缩减军备区，将成为准备德国重新统一的第一个步骤。
    “新德意志报”最近以“乌布利希答复阿登纳”为题刊登了乌布利希就波恩政府给苏联政府的关于德国问题的备忘录所写的一篇文章。
    乌布利希在文章里还说：阿登纳政府不愿意承认德国统一首先是德国人自己的事。德意志民主共和国是主权国家，任何其他国家都不能没有它的同意而决定德国的前途问题。他强调指出：“如果西德政府放弃它的军国主义政策，那末两个德国政府之间的接近和合作是可能的。”
    乌布利希认为：应该就德国统一社会党中央委员会第三十次全会和民主德国全国阵线的建议在西德人民中间进行广泛讨论和交换意见。
