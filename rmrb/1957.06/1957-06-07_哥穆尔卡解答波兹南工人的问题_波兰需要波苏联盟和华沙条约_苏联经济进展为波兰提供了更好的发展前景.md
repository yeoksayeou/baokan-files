Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 6th: Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, answered more than one hundred questions raised by more than three thousand worker representatives of the Cegielski Machine Factory in Poznan on June 5th.

    When discussing Poland's grain import problem, Gomułka pointed out that compared with the pre-war period, the post-war Polish output of four major grains has increased by 67 kilograms per capita. However, this increase still cannot keep up with the needs of the people and the increase in purchasing power. Grain imports were particularly high in 1954 and 1955.

    He also mentioned that the production and consumption of meat are now double what they were before the war. Milk production has also increased considerably. However, it is still necessary to import butter, while pre-war Poland exported butter.

    Gomułka said that average consumption figures show that living standards have improved considerably in the era of the people's government, with smaller improvements in cities and larger improvements in rural areas.

    When answering questions about the living standards of the working class in capitalist and socialist countries, Gomułka pointed out that the living standards in some capitalist countries are higher than those in Poland. This is due to many reasons, one particularly important reason being that some capitalist countries have conquered continents through colonialism and exploited hundreds of millions of people through colonialism. Socialist countries, including Poland, are rapidly recovering from the backward economic state left by the capitalist social system. Observing the economic development of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, one can see that it has taken a big step forward. The economic progress of the Soviet Union also provides Poland with better development prospects, thereby providing prospects for a more rapid improvement in the living standards of the Polish working class. By 1960, real wages will increase by at least 30% compared to the last year of the Six-Year Plan.

    When talking about the housing problem, Gomułka said that the number of houses under construction is more than double what it was before the war. The current Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of 1.2 million rooms, 200,000 of which are to be completed this year. If the workers in the building materials industry and the housing construction industry greatly mobilize their enthusiasm, then the housing construction plan will be overfulfilled.

    When talking about the Nowa Huta Lenin Steelworks, Gomułka pointed out that the production cost of this enterprise is much lower than that of other Polish steel factories. Poland has already obtained a large amount of profit from this enterprise, and its profit will greatly increase after the planned construction is completed. When asked whether Poland has a long-term economic plan, Gomułka said that such a plan is being formulated, and this plan is largely related to the future export potential of Polish industry, especially the export potential of the machine manufacturing industry.

    Gomułka also talked about Czechoslovakia's assistance to Poland in mining sulfur. He emphasized that any country that is willing to provide Poland with investment loans for economic development under normal commercial conditions should be accepted. So far, socialist countries have provided and are providing us with such loans on preferential terms. Capitalist countries are not eager to give us loans, although we have made suggestions to them. However, Poland only wants investment loans that are repaid under strictly stipulated conditions. Therefore, the country providing the loan will not be able to obtain any profit from the industrial enterprises built.

    Regarding the US loan issue, Gomułka said that in Poland, especially after Eisenhower publicly expressed his willingness to provide Poland with credit assistance last October, many people had illusions that as long as the Polish government made a loan request to the United States, it could immediately obtain loans that met Poland's needs. The US government only agreed to start negotiations in February this year, and the Polish delegation has been in the United States since February 25th. Now an agreement has been reached in the negotiations, and we are waiting for its signature; according to this agreement, the United States will provide Poland with a loan of 95 million US dollars. It will help to solve our recent economic difficulties to a certain extent.

    Gomułka also mentioned that in addition to loans from the United States, Poland has recently obtained 100 million US dollars of lignite investment from Democratic Germany and a roughly equal amount of sulfur investment from Czechoslovakia. A few months ago, Poland also obtained more than 20 million US dollars of investment from France.

    Gomułka said that in addition to close economic cooperation with socialist countries, we also hope to develop economic relations with capitalist countries—this must be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and should not be subject to any political conditions.

    Answering a question about the Polish-Soviet alliance, Gomułka said that the party, the People's Government, and all Polish patriots have been declaring for the past few years that Poland must form an alliance with the Soviet Union. This truth is what we have been proclaiming, are still proclaiming, and will continue to proclaim in the future.

    When talking about someone who once asked whether the Soviet Union could guarantee Poland's Oder-Neisse border, Gomułka said, yes, it can. It can only defend these borders when we ourselves are the defenders of our borders, when we resolutely defend Polish-Soviet friendship and the solidarity of the socialist camp. Regarding the Warsaw Pact, Gomułka said that our wish is to oppose the existence of any military treaty. But in the current situation, all Warsaw Pact signatory countries need the Warsaw Pact, and Poland especially needs it.

    Gomułka also expressed his willingness to establish normal relations with West Germany based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. He said that we believe that this will help the peaceful reunification of Germany. However, the ruling group in West Germany has so far shown no signs of making unremitting efforts to establish such relations with Poland. Obviously, border revisionists and militarists have too much influence on them.

    Gomułka also talked about commemorating those who died in the Poznan events last year, saying that we should unanimously have a conscious desire to prevent the real enemies of People's Poland from gaining any benefit from the family tragedy that occurred in Poznan. The party and the government have drawn extensive conclusions from the Poznan tragedy. All these conclusions are aimed at closely linking the working class and the working masses with the people's regime.

    哥穆尔卡解答波兹南工人的问题  波兰需要波苏联盟和华沙条约
    苏联经济进展为波兰提供了更好的发展前景
    据新华社华沙6日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡6月5日向波兹南的策格耳斯基机器制造厂的三千多名工人代表解答了工人们提出的一百多个问题。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到波兰的谷物进口问题时指出，同战前比较，按人口平均计算，战后波兰的四种主要谷物产量增加了六十七公斤。但是这种增长还跟不上人民的需要和购买力的提高。1954年和1955年，谷物进口量特别高。
    他又谈到，现在，肉类的产量和消费量都比战前增加了一倍。牛奶的产量也有了相当大的增长。但是现在仍然需要进口牛油，而战前波兰却出口牛油。
    哥穆尔卡说，平均消费数字表明：生活水平在人民政权的年代有了相当大的提高；城市中提高得较少，乡村中提高得较多。
    哥穆尔卡在回答关于资本主义国家和社会主义国家工人阶级生活水平的问题时指出，一些资本主义国家的生活水平比波兰的生活水平高。这是由许多原因造成的，其中特别重要的一个原因是一些资本主义国家用殖民主义手段征服了各大洲，并且对亿万人民进行殖民主义的剥削。社会主义国家，包括波兰在内，正在从资本主义社会制度所遗留下的落后经济状态中迅速恢复过来。在观察第一个社会主义国家苏联的经济发展的时候可以看到：它已经向前跃进了一大步。苏联的经济进展也为波兰提供了更好的发展前景，从而为波兰工人阶级生活水平的更迅速的提高提供了前景。到1960年，实际工资将比六年计划最后一年至少提高30％。
    在谈到住房问题的时候，哥穆尔卡说，正在建筑中的住宅相当于战前的两倍以上。目前的五年计划规定要建造房屋一百二十万间，其中有二十万间要在今年建成。如果建筑器材工业和住房建造业的工人大大发挥积极性，那末住宅建造计划就会超额完成。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业的时候指出，这个企业的生产成本比其他波兰冶金工厂低得多。波兰已经从这个企业取得了大量的利润，在计划中的建设全部完成以后，它的利润还将大大增加。在回答波兰是否有一个长期经济计划的问题时，哥穆尔卡说，正在拟定这样的计划，这个计划在很大程度上同波兰工业将来出口的可能性、特别是同机器制造工业出口的可能性有关。
    哥穆尔卡还谈到捷克斯洛伐克帮助波兰开采硫矿的问题。他强调说，任何国家假如愿意按照正常的商业条件向波兰提供发展经济的投资贷款，我们都应该接受。到现在为止，社会主义国家已经根据优惠条件向我们提供了并且正在提供这种贷款。资本主义国家并不急于给我们贷款，尽管我们已经向他们提出建议。但是，波兰要的只是按照严格规定的条件偿还的那种投资贷款。因此提供贷款的国家将不能从所建成的工业企业中得到任何利润。
    关于美国贷款的问题，哥穆尔卡说，在波兰，特别是在艾森豪威尔去年10月公开表示愿意向波兰提供信贷援助之后，有许多人抱有幻想，认为只要波兰政府向美国提出贷款要求，就可以马上得到同波兰的需要相适应的贷款了。美国政府在今年2月才同意开始谈判，而波兰代表团自从2月25日以来就一直呆在美国。现在谈判已经达成了一项协议，我们正在等候它的签字；根据这项协议，美国将向波兰提供九千五百万美元的贷款。它在一定程度上有助于解决我们最近的经济困难。
    哥穆尔卡还谈到，除了美国的贷款以外，波兰最近已经从民主德国获得一亿美元的褐煤投资，从捷克斯洛伐克获得数额大体相同的硫黄投资。几个月以前，波兰还从法国获得了两千多万美元的投资。
    哥穆尔卡说，除了同社会主义国家进行密切的经济合作以外，我们也希望同资本主义国家发展经济关系——这必须是根据平等互利的原则，而且不应该附有任何政治条件。
    哥穆尔卡回答有关波苏同盟的问题说，党、人民政府和全体波兰爱国人士过去几年来一直宣称：波兰必须同苏联结成同盟。这一真理是我们一直在宣扬的，现在还在宣扬，将来也还要宣扬。
    谈到有人曾经问苏联能否保障波兰的奥得—尼斯河边界时，哥穆尔卡说，是的，它能够。只有当我们自己是我们边疆的保卫者的时候，只有当我们坚决保卫波苏友谊和社会主义阵营团结的时候，它才能保卫这些边疆。关于华沙条约，哥穆尔卡说，我们的愿望是反对任何军事条约的存在。但是在目前形势下，所有华沙条约签字国都需要华沙条约，波兰尤其需要它。
    哥穆尔卡还表示愿意根据和平共处的原则同西德建立正常关系。他说，我们认为这将有助于德国的和平统一。但是，西德统治集团至今没有迹象表示要进行坚持不懈的努力以便同波兰建立这种关系。显然，边界修正论者和军国主义者对他们的影响太大了。
    哥穆尔卡还谈到纪念去年波兹南事件中死亡者的问题，他说，我们应该一致抱有自觉的愿望，防止人民波兰的真正敌人从波兹南所发生的我们的家庭悲剧中取得任何好处。党和政府已经从波兹南悲剧中得出了广泛的结论。这一切结论的目的都在于使工人阶级和劳动群众同人民政权紧密地联系起来。
