　　The match was held under cloudy and damp conditions, and the competition was very intense. Just one minute into the game, the Myanmar team's right wing took advantage of a gap in the Chinese team's defense and broke through, shooting from about ten meters out, but the ball was caught by goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen. Chinese team center forward Zhang Honggen also shot from about fourteen meters out after three minutes, but it was not powerful enough to score. After four minutes, the Myanmar team narrowly shot at the Chinese goal again. After eighteen minutes, Zhang Honggen left the field due to a foot injury and was replaced by Nian Weisizi as center forward. The Chinese team controlled the ball a lot and had many attacks. The opponent's right wing was active, the crosses were well-placed, and the forward line was fast, posing a considerable threat to the Chinese team. After thirty-one minutes, the Myanmar team crossed from the right, and the left wing volleyed from six meters out, sending the ball into the Chinese team's goal. The Myanmar team took a 1-0 lead. Although the Chinese team attacked several times after that, they did not succeed.

　　In the second half, the Chinese team attacked vigorously, and Fang Renqiu's dribbling and passing were very active, creating many dangerous situations in front of the opponent's goal. After twenty-eight minutes, Chinese team left wing Wang Lu threw the ball in from the left sideline, and Cong Zheyu took advantage of the opponent's goalkeeper's unpreparedness and scored a long-range shot, leveling the score at 1-1. After thirty-seven minutes, Pu Wanfu made a long pass, Fang Renqiu headed the ball, and Cong Zheyu volleyed from thirteen meters out, but unfortunately it was a little high and did not go in. After forty minutes, the Myanmar team's right wing passed to the right inside forward near the baseline, the Chinese team's defense and goalkeeper were out of position, and the opponent took advantage of the opportunity to score. The match ended with a score of 2-1, with the Myanmar team winning.

　　中缅举行足球友谊赛
    缅甸队以二比一获胜
    据新华社仰光28日电　中国足球队27日下午同缅甸国家足球队进行了一场友谊赛。缅甸队以二比一获胜。
    球赛是在天阴场湿的情况下进行的，双方竞争得很剧烈。球赛开始刚一分钟，缅甸队右翼即乘中国队后方空虚插入，在约十公尺处射门，球被守门员黄肇文接住。中国队中锋张宏根三分钟时也在约十四公尺处射一球，但是因力弱未入。四分钟时，缅甸队再度险射中国球门。十八分时，张宏根因脚疼退场，由年维泗接任中锋。中国队控球很多，攻势也盛。对方右翼活跃，传中的球落点好，锋线速度也快，因此对中国队威胁不小。三十一分钟时，缅甸队从右边传中，左翼在六公尺处扫射，球入中国队球门。缅甸队以一比零占先。此后中国队虽数次攻射，都未得手。
    下半场中国队大力进攻，方纫秋盘射传球十分活跃，对方门前险象环生。二十八分钟时，中国队左翼王陆从左边掷线外球，丛者余乘对方守门员不备，远射入网，扳成一比一。三十七分钟时，朴万福远传，方纫秋头顶，丛者余在十三公尺处扫射，可惜高了一点，没有攻入。四十分钟时，缅甸队右翼在底线附近传右内锋，中国队后卫和守门员位置已乱，被对方乘虚射入。球赛最后以二比一告终，缅甸队胜。
