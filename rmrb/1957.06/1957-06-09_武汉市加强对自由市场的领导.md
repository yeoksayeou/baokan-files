    Wuhan City Strengthens Leadership Over Free Markets

    The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has formulated a number of concrete measures to actively lead free markets. This was decided at a recent symposium held in Wuhan to strengthen the leadership and management of free markets. More than eighty related units participated in the meeting.

    The meeting decided that various management methods for free markets must first be based on expanding the organization of goods supply. Relevant state-owned companies must establish production and sales contracts or pre-purchase relationships with more than 100 vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs, so that the main varieties of vegetables can be sold directly to vegetable companies by the production cooperatives, in order to prevent price increases by vendors. State-owned companies will also add retail outlets in various vegetable markets, stipulating that vendors must strictly implement clearly marked prices. Existing vendors will be reviewed, registered, and issued permits to facilitate management. Speculators and middlemen who specialize in reselling will be banned. A market management committee will be organized in each vegetable market throughout the city to strengthen the leadership of the vegetable market.

    In terms of developing production, the meeting believes that the most effective method is to increase the number of replanting times on more than 30,000 mu of vegetable land in the suburbs. If calculated on the basis of an average increase of one replanting per year, more than 30 million jin of vegetables can be produced throughout the year. The production department also plans to expand new vegetable land by 7,000 mu this year. Strict control will be exercised over the requisition of vegetable land by basic construction departments, and vegetable land that has been requisitioned but not used will also be returned to farmers for use.

    The meeting also decided to expand fish farms and encourage fishermen to breed fresh fish in large lakes. At the same time, the aquatic products department and fishermen will study how to expand the catch in the Yangtze and Han Rivers.

    武汉市加强对自由市场的领导
    武汉市人民委员会订出许多积极领导自由市场的具体措施，这是武汉市最近召开的加强对自由市场领导与管理的座谈会上的决定。八十多个有关单位参加了这个会议。
    会议决定，对自由市场的各种管理办法首先必须建立在扩大组织货源的基础上。有关国营公司必须与市郊一百多个蔬菜生产合作社建立产销合同或预购关系，使蔬菜中的主要品种能由生产社直接卖给蔬菜公司，以防止商贩的抬价。国营公司并将在各蔬菜市场上增设零售点，规定商贩要严格执行明码实价，对现有的商贩将予以审查、登记、发证，以便于管理，对一些投机倒把、专作转手买卖的中间商贩将加以取缔。全市每个菜市场内并将组织市场管理委员会，加强对蔬菜市场的领导。
    在发展生产方面，会议认为最有效的办法是在市郊三万多亩菜地上增加复种次数，如以每年平均增加一次复种计算，全年就可以增产蔬菜三千多万斤。生产部门今年还计划扩大新菜地七千亩，对基本建设部门征用菜地，要予以严格控制，已被征而未用的菜地也将归还农民使用。
    会议并决定扩大养殖鱼场，提倡渔民在大湖内繁殖鲜鱼，同时将由水产部门和渔民研究如何在长江、汉水内扩大江河捕捞量。
