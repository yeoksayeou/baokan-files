From the past, people died from illness with no money for treatment; now, an ambulance arrives with just one phone call.
    Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch: Deng Juben, the head of the Yinhe Agricultural Cooperative, said: "Before liberation, almost every family in our village lacked food. Now even the blind don't worry about not having enough to eat. This year, the whole village's cloth ration coupons have been used up. Every family has made new clothes. Before cooperation, the whole village didn't have a single vehicle, now there are two small pushcarts, four horse-drawn carts, and two large trucks. In the past, farmers died from illness with no money for treatment; now, if someone suffers a minor injury, an ambulance arrives in the village with just one phone call. Before liberation, 70% of the farmers in the village had no shoes to wear; now, most people have three pairs of shoes each."

　　从前病到死也没钱医
　　现在一个电话就开来了救护车
    本报广州13日电　银河农业社社长邓巨本说：“我村解放前几乎家家缺粮。现在连瞎子也不担心没得吃了。今年全村的购布证都买完了。家家都做了新衣服。合作化前全村没有一部车子，现在有两部小板车、四部马车、两部大汽车。从前农民病到死也没钱医，现在若是有人受了轻伤，打一个电话，救护车就到村子里来了。解放前，全村农民有70％没有鞋子穿，现在大多数每人有三双鞋。”
