A scene from an old opera: A woman's husband dies. While performing Buddhist rituals for her husband, praying for the salvation of his soul, the woman becomes entangled with a monk who comes to her house to chant scriptures. As the two are having a secret rendezvous, the woman's son happens to catch them. Overcome with lustful passion and fearing that her son will ruin her affair, the woman kills him with a kitchen knife one night...

The night of the killing is eerie and terrifying. The mother holds a knife in one hand and grabs her son with the other. The son and daughter kneel and beg the mother for forgiveness, weeping and wailing. The mother expresses reluctance in her heart, but after several back-and-forths, she finally kills her son with one stroke. After killing her son in bed, the mother emerges from the tent, her face covered in blood, with the same blood-soaked kitchen knife in her mouth. Not satisfied with this, to destroy the evidence, she cuts the son's body into eight pieces and forces her daughter to bring a jar to put the remains in.

Bloody pieces are thrown out of the tent one by one: a human head, an arm, a leg, a piece of flesh, and then another piece of flesh...

This cruel mother later received the punishment of the "law of the land." But the audience could no longer consider her fate because a child in the theater was so frightened that he started crying. His mother hurriedly took him out, and then a second mother also took her child out...

This is the performance of "Killing the Son for Retribution," a program that was recently unbanned by the Ministry of Culture and seen on the Pingju stages in Beijing and Tianjin in the past half-month.

Another day, I saw the unbanned Pingju opera "Huang Shi's Daughter Travels to the Underworld" performed in Beijing:

The author of this old opera attempted to make people believe in the karmic cycle of good and evil in the human world and the fatalistic idea of cause and effect. The play depicts the Fifth Hall Yama summoning a wealthy man's wife, "Huang the Kind," to the underworld; letting her see the male and female ghosts in the eighteen levels of hell suffering the bloody punishments of having their tongues cut out, eyes gouged out, bellies cut open, hearts gouged out, being thrown into oil pots, and embracing burning pillars.

The ghost soldiers tell Huang the Kind that those people committed evil deeds when they were alive and are suffering for their sins after death... Huang the Kind nods repeatedly, convinced, and says: Retribution! Retribution!...

The cutting of tongues, gouging of eyes, cutting open of bellies, and gouging of hearts in the eighteen levels of hell are the main content of this play because if you remove these, there is no "play." The actors have done their utmost to highlight these aspects: the eyes are gouged out, and blood flows out; the eyeballs are attached to a bloody thread hanging in the eye socket, and the executing ghost soldier cuts the eyeball off with a knife and eats it. After the belly is cut open, the ghost soldier pulls out the intestines and wraps them around his neck, and finally grabs a heart and liver from the belly and chews them up in his mouth...

My description may be too much for some readers to bear, but our respectable actors are performing it with such great enthusiasm! And during the killing of the son and the cutting open of the belly, some audience members are clapping and cheering?

I am thinking: the Ministry of Culture, in the past, banned a batch of operas rather inconsiderately; due to this, some rigid rules and regulations have arisen, which have had adverse consequences in hindering the development of the theatrical arts. Now, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of theatrical workers throughout the country and to promote the fine traditions of our theatrical arts, the Ministry of Culture has very readily opened up all the programs that were previously banned. Moreover, the leading comrades in the Party's cultural affairs have also put forward the slogan of "Prohibiting the Banning of Operas." But I always feel that we should be more specific, detailed, and accurate in our work, and we should deal with matters on a case-by-case basis. Plays like "Killing the Son for Retribution," "Huang Shi's Daughter Travels to the Underworld," and other programs that are completely harmful and useless to the people, besides pornography, murder, barbarism, and reaction, have absolutely nothing to offer. Everything has its two sides, and to say that the Ministry of Culture will never allow the banning of operas from now on is an absurd statement; I think the plays listed above should be banned in our country no matter what.

I am thinking: theater, like any other genre in literature and art, should always only be something beautiful. In our People's Republic, our hundreds of millions of people should absorb spiritual nourishment on the stage, and through the performances of the actors on the stage, they should receive education and recognize the truth. In the past reactionary ruling society, the ruling class once used disguised art as a tool to麻醉 (má zuì - anesthetize) the people. Now, capitalist countries like the United States are even more frantically using pornography and murder to achieve the purpose of poisoning the people. We despise and even hate such things. It has been eight years since the national liberation, and our opera actors have made great contributions to the socialist cause of the motherland in the past eight years, and the actors have also been of great help in raising the political awareness of the people. People also believe that opera artists can well grasp the repertoire and choose their own path, and the Ministry of Culture's unbanning of the twenty-odd banned plays should have been made after considering this situation. However, as an ordinary audience member, I cannot help but feel disappointed that the first plays that the Pingju actors performed at the beginning of the unbanning were "Killing the Son for Retribution" and "Huang Shi's Daughter Travels to the Underworld."

The Ministry of Culture's past banning of some plays and today's unbanning of plays both have symbolic significance. The former illustrates the necessary constraints and vigilance in the early days of liberation when the domestic situation was still unstable, while the latter illustrates that the current promotion of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to further promote the prosperity and flourishing of literature and art is a proper measure. Therefore, although the plays that were banned in the past and unbanned today are only twenty-odd plays, they represent a rich and varied number of extremely vast plays. Taking traditional plays alone, our predecessors have left us a wealth of wealth that is almost impossible to count, and we have many plays that can be performed and are beneficial to the audience; but why do we have to perform plays like "Killing the Son for Retribution" and "Huang Shi's Daughter Travels to the Underworld" that people can't bear to watch?

Actors all over the country regard Beijing as the direction, and the actors in Beijing have the dual responsibility of educating the audience and influencing the whole country. And now I can fully imagine that if an international friend came to Beijing and watched our performances of "Killing the Son for Retribution," "Huang Shi's Daughter Travels to the Underworld," and other programs of similar nature; wrote a few articles and took a few photos, they would have full and sufficient reasons to say that our country is a backward, barbaric, and ignorant country.

At the moment of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend, let a hundred flowers bloom," at the moment when the Ministry of Culture is opening up the repertoire, is it a bit obstructive to contend and out of touch with the times to offer opinions on the newly opened repertoire? It was for this reason that I hesitated for a long time whether or not to write this article. But I finally wrote it, and even if it causes resentment from others, I still feel that I have to write it. Because I hope to see exotic flowers bloom on the stage of our people, to see the beautiful develop, to see the truth be victorious, to see the reactionary and evil be attacked and criticized; pornography and murder should not be on the stage of our people at all.

The audience is the best friend of the actors. Here, I extend my brotherly blessings to my respected actor comrades, and I wish you greater achievements in your theatrical careers.

### “杀子报”这样的戏

　　“杀子报”这样的戏
　　吴祖光
    这是一个旧剧的情节：有一个女人死了丈夫。在为丈夫做佛事，祈祷超渡亡魂的时候，这个女人和到家里来念经的和尚勾搭上了。两人正在幽会，不巧正被女人的儿子碰上，女人恋奸情热，怕儿子破坏好事，在一个夜晚手执菜刀把儿子杀了……
    杀子之夜，阴森恐怖，做母亲的一手举刀，一手抓着儿子，儿子和女儿哭哭啼啼跪求母亲饶恕；母亲也曾表示了心中的不忍，但是反复几次之后，终于把儿子一刀杀死。母亲杀死了睡在床上的儿子之后，从帐子里反身出来，满脸鲜血，口里衔着同样满是鲜血的菜刀；这样还不够，为了毁尸灭迹，她把儿子的尸首切成八块，强迫女儿搬来一个坛子，把尸首装进去。
    血淋淋地，一个人头从帐子里扔出来了，一只胳膊，一条腿，一块肉，又一块肉……
    这个残忍的母亲后来受到了“国法”的制裁。但是观众已经无法考虑到她的下场问题，因为剧场里有一个孩子吓得哭了起来，他的母亲匆匆地抱他出去了，然后第二个母亲也抱了孩子出去了……
    这是在最近半个月期间，在北京和天津的评剧舞台上看到的被文化部解禁后的节目“杀子报”的演出情况。
    又一天我又看到了北京演出的开禁剧目评剧“黄氏女游阴”：
    这个旧剧的作者企图使人们相信人世间的善恶轮回和因果报应的宿命论思想。剧中描写五殿阎君把一位员外夫人“黄善人”召到阴曹地府；让她看一看十八层地狱里男男女女的鬼魂受那些割舌、挖眼、剖腹、剜心、下油锅、抱火柱等等的血肉刑罚。
    鬼卒告诉黄善人说那些人生前作恶，死后受罪……黄善人连连点头，心悦诚服，说：报应呀！报应呀……
    十八层地狱里的割舌、挖眼、剖腹、剜心……是这出戏的主要的内容，因为假如除去这些就没有“戏”了。演员在这一方面是极尽了突出的能事的：眼睛挖出来了，血往外流；眼珠子牵着一根血丝挂在眼眶上，执刑的鬼卒一刀把眼珠割下来，放到嘴里吃掉。剖腹之后，鬼卒把肠子拉出来盘到自己脖子上，最后从肚子里抓出来一副心肝，也放到嘴里大嚼……
    我这样描写，可能有些读者会读不下去了，但是我们可尊敬的演员同志却那样兴高彩烈地演下去呀！而且在杀子的时候，剖腹的时候却也有一些观众在鼓掌喝彩呢？
    我在这样想：文化部过去相当欠考虑地禁了一批戏；由于这样引起的一些清规戒律，起了不小的阻碍戏剧事业发展的不良后果。现在为了鼓舞全国戏剧工作者的劳动热情，发扬我们戏剧事业的优良传统，文化部非常痛快地又把过去禁止的节目全部开放了。而且党的文化事业的领导同志还提出了“禁止禁戏”的口号。但是我总是觉得，我们做工作应当具体一些，细致一些，准确一些，应当就事论事。像“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”以及其他一些对人民完全有害无益的剧目，除了色情，凶杀，野蛮，反动之外实在一无可取。任何事物都具有它的两面性，说文化部从此以后便永远不准许禁戏了，这是一种荒谬的说法；像上面列举的剧目，我想在我们的国家无论如何也是应当禁止的。
    我在这样想：戏剧同文艺中的任何其他的种类一样，它永远只应该是美的东西。在我们的人民共和国里，我们的亿万广大的人民都要在戏剧的舞台上吸取精神的食粮，通过演员们在舞台上的表演得到教育，认识真理。在过去反动统治的社会，统治阶级曾经利用伪装过的艺术来做麻醉人民的工具。现在像美国这样的资本主义国家更是疯狂地以色情和凶杀来达到毒害人民的目的。我们对这样的事情是唾弃的，甚至是痛恨的。全国解放已经八年了，我们的戏曲演员们八年以来为祖国的社会主义事业建立了很大的功绩，演员们对于人民群众政治觉悟的提高，也有很大的帮助。人们也都认为戏曲艺人是能够很好地掌握剧目，选择自己的道路的，文化部对二十几个禁演剧目的开禁亦应该正是在考虑了这样的情况之后做出的决定。但是对于开禁之初评剧演员们首先上演的却是“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”这样的剧目，做为一个普通的观众，我是不能不感到失望的。
    文化部过去禁演一些剧目和今天解禁剧目都具有象征的意义。前者说明对于解放初期国内局势尚不安定的必需的约束和警惕，后者说明在目前的提倡“百花齐放，百家争鸣”使文学艺术事业进一步趋于繁荣兴盛是应有的措施。因此当初禁止和今天解禁的剧目虽然不过二十几出戏，但却是代表着丰富多彩的极为浩繁的剧目。仅以传统剧目来说，我们的前辈艺人为我们留下了几乎无从统计的财富，我们可演之戏，对观众有益之戏正多；而我们何以偏偏就非演像“杀子报”和“黄氏女游阴”这一类叫人看不下去的剧目呢？
    全国的演员都把北京作为方向，在北京的演员负有教育观众影响全国的双重责任。而现在我完全可以设想，假如有一位国际友人来到北京，看了我们演出的“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”以及其他可能差不多性质的节目；写几篇文章，照几张像，有十足充分的理由，说我们的国家是一个落后的，野蛮的，愚昧的国家。
    正在“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的时刻，正在文化部开放剧目的时刻，来对刚开放的剧目提意见该是有些阻碍争鸣，不识时务吧？正是为了这样的原故，我犹豫了很久该不该写这篇文章。但是我终于写了，即使引起别人的反感我也觉得还是要写。因为我希望看到我们人民的舞台上奇花开放，看到美好的在发展，看到真理得到胜利，看到反动的，邪恶的受到打击和批判；色情和凶杀根本不该登上我们人民的舞台。
    观众是演员最好的朋友，在这里向我尊敬的演员同志致以兄弟般的祝福，祝你们在戏剧事业上获得更大的成就。
