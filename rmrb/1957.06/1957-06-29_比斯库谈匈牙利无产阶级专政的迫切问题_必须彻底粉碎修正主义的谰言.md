Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, Budapest: "People's Freedom" published a report by Béla Biszku, a member of the Provisional Central Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, on May 29th, concerning urgent issues of the Hungarian proletarian dictatorship.

　　Biszku said that recently, revisionists have been trying hard to prove that the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat is outdated and must therefore be thoroughly revised. The Hungarian counter-revolutionary events of last October demonstrated the essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat and once again proved the correctness of Lenin's doctrine. Revisionists have spread false views on the dictatorship of the proletariat domestically, arguing that the doctrines of dictatorship and class struggle are incompatible with Marxism-Leninism. Even within the Party, harmful illusions prevailed, with many believing that since the economic rule of the bourgeoisie had been eliminated, they could no longer restore their old regime. There was an underestimation of the petty-bourgeois forces who longed for the past, deeply rooted bourgeois ideology, and nationalism. The report said that the experience of proletarian revolutions around the world proves that the Marxist-Leninist doctrines of the dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle are correct.

　　Biszku pointed out that petty-bourgeois elements cannot become the leading force in society, nor can intellectuals who waver between the new and old social systems. He continued, saying that intellectuals can only contribute to socialist construction under the leadership of the proletariat. It is by no means accidental that the bourgeoisie always tries to alienate non-proletarian laborers from the working class.

　　Biszku then criticized the revisionists' argument that the repressive role of the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer needed during the transition period under relatively peaceful conditions. Revisionists insisted that the exploiters and their allies in Hungary had been eliminated. The report said that the role of violence should still exist during the period of socialist construction because domestic enemies are still trying to restore their regime by relying on imperialist forces.

　　Biszku then spoke about the need to strengthen educational work, especially the education of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Many people oppose state leadership of education. The state's leading role must be guaranteed, because without such leadership, bourgeois culture will proliferate.

　　Biszku also criticized the revisionists' erroneous view of negating the Party's leading role, arguing that the Party should not play a leading and guiding role, but only a role of propaganda and mobilization. Biszku believed that in addition to strengthening the Party's leading role, forces loyal to the cause of socialism within the People's Front should also be united.

　　Finally, Biszku said that in order to strengthen the system of proletarian dictatorship, the following tasks should be carried out: 1. Consolidate the working-class regime, suppress and isolate the remnants of the counter-revolution. 2. Consolidate the political foundation of the proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidate the leading role of the working class in the alliance. 3. Further strengthen socialist democracy. 4. In Hungary, the coercive aspect of the proletarian dictatorship should not be relegated to a secondary position, and the economic organizational work of the proletarian dictatorship should be strengthened. 5. Strengthen the Party's leading and guiding role.

　　比斯库谈匈牙利无产阶级专政的迫切问题
    必须彻底粉碎修正主义的谰言
    新华社28日讯　布达佩斯消息：“人民自由报”5月29日刊登了匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央执行委员会委员比斯库的关于匈牙利无产阶级专政的迫切问题的报告。
    比斯库说，近来，修正主义者竭力企图证明马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说已经过时了，因此必须彻底修改这种学说。去年十月匈牙利反革命事件表明了无产阶级专政的实质，并再次证明了列宁学说的正确性。修正主义分子在国内散布了关于无产阶级专政的虚伪观点，他们认为专政和阶级斗争的学说是与马克思列宁主义不相容的学说。甚至在党内也流行着有害的幻想，许多人都这样认为，由于消灭了资产阶级的经济统治，因此，它就再也不能恢复他们的旧政权了。有人对那些留恋过去的小资产阶级力量、根深蒂固的资产阶级思想和民族主义都估计不足。报告说，世界各地无产阶级革命的经验证明，马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的学说是正确的。
    比斯库指出，小资产阶级分子不能成为社会的领导力量，摇摆于新的社会制度和旧的社会制度之间的知识分子也不能成为社会的领导力量。他接着说，知识分子只有在无产阶级的领导下才能够对社会主义建设事业作出贡献。资产阶级总想离间非无产阶级劳动者同工人阶级的关系，这种做法绝不是偶然的。
    比斯库接着批判了修正主义者提出的、在处在比较和平的条件下的过渡时期中，不再需要无产阶级专政的镇压作用的论调，修正主义者硬说，匈牙利的剥削者和他们的同盟者已经被消灭了。报告说，在建设社会主义时期暴力作用仍然应该存在，因为国内的敌人仍然企图依靠帝国主义势力恢复自己的政权。
    比斯库接着谈到必须加强教育工作，特别是必须加强对小资产阶级知识分子的教育工作。许多人反对国家领导教育工作。国家的领导作用必须保证，因为没有这种领导，资产阶级文化就会泛滥起来。
    比斯库还批判了修正主义者否定党的领导作用的错误观点，他们认为，党不应当起领导和指导作用，只能起宣传鼓动作用。比斯库认为，除了加强党的领导作用以外，还应该把人民阵线内部忠于社会主义事业的力量团结起来。
    最后，比斯库说，要加强无产阶级专政制度，应该执行下列的任务：1．巩固工人阶级政权，镇压和孤立反革命残余。2．巩固无产阶级专政的政治基础，巩固工农联盟和巩固工人阶级在联盟中的领导作用。3．进一步加强社会主义民主。4．在匈牙利不应该使无产阶级专政带强制性的一面退居次要的地位，同时应该加强无产阶级专政的经济组织工作。5．加强党的领导和指导作用。
