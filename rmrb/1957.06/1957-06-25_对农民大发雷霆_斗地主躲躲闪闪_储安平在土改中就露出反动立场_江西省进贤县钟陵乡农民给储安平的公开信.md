To Mr. Chu Anping,

We farmers don't have much education or theory, but we can tell who's good and who's bad. The Communist Party, for the sake of the people and the socialist cause, has decided to conduct rectification campaigns in organizations at all levels across the country, with the aim of overcoming bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism committed by certain party members and organizations. But you seized the opportunity to provoke the masses to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. From your speech, we feel that you are indeed very reactionary, and we express our anger at your behavior.

You extremely hate the Communist Party, but we无比 adore the Communist Party; you frantically oppose socialism, and we wholeheartedly support socialism. Our love for the Communist Party and our support for socialism are not empty words, there are reasons. You came to our place to participate in land reform, and you already know our living conditions before liberation. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were grabbing men for the army everywhere, collecting money and goods, landlords and bullies were forcing rent and debts, and bandits and thugs were robbing on the road all day long. Even now, when we talk about the suffering we suffered in the past, we still feel sad and shed tears. Among the thirty-two peasant households in Sitang Village, only two could be considered not to have begged for food. Do you still remember? What about now? The situation has completely changed. Who begs for food in Sitang Village today? Everyone has reached the level of a middle peasant. Even the lonely old people with no children are living well and enjoying the "five guarantees" after joining the agricultural cooperative. In the past, Nanan Village was completely unlike a village due to the extortion of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the exploitation of landlords and bullies through heavy rents and high interest rates. The houses, a dozen or so of them, were either broken at the top and leaking at the bottom, or tilted to one side. Now it has changed. Among the twenty-six peasant households in the whole village, seven have renovated their houses, and two have built new houses. Our agricultural cooperative has been running for three years now, and the harvest is much better than before. Last year's grain harvest, converted into rice, was more than 180,000 jin more than the previous year. Based on the cooperative's 1,477 people, each person could increase by 122 jin. After our production plan is completed this year, we will harvest even more grain. Over the years, our living standards have improved rapidly. Isn't this because the Communist Party is leading well? Isn't this the benefit of the socialist system that has eliminated exploitation? You want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. Based on our own personal experience, we see that only the Communist Party is the best leader for the people, and only the socialist system is the best social system. Therefore, we resolutely oppose your vicious remarks against the leadership of the Party. We hope that the Party will strengthen its leadership in the future and lead the people of the whole country to build our socialist country faster and better.

Your hatred for the leadership of the Communist Party and your opposition to socialism are blatant expressions of your reactionary bourgeois stance. You not only miss the bourgeois society, but also have illusions and ambitions about it. When it comes to this issue, we would like to take the situation when you participated in the land reform here as some evidence for reference, and you can also recall it yourself.

During the two months or so from January to March 1952, you came to our place with the land reform team of the Central Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to participate in land reform. You treated us with a straight face all day long, and you lost your temper at every turn, and did not accept our opinions. You once quarreled and cursed with farmer Hu Jiecai over the matter of dividing the fields. Once, when distributing the landlord's ill-gotten wealth, you became furious because the distribution of a washbasin did not meet your expectations. You slammed the table and yelled at people. You looked really ugly. The masses were afraid of you and scolded you behind your back as if you were a robber. You thought you were great, full of the stinking airs of an old intellectual, and you didn't look down on us farmers at all. There was not only a high wall between you and us, but also an ocean. However, in the struggle against the enemy, you always shrank back and never controlled a single struggle session (the struggle session was always controlled by Comrade Zhou Weiwen). When we were fighting against the landlord, you just watched and wandered around the venue. After thinking about it, we felt that your participation in the land reform here that time could not be regarded as participation in land reform at all, but just a look. After seeing it, what did you really feel? Although you didn't say it, after comparing it, we felt that your position was very problematic. This has been fully proven today.

You may think we are ruthless! In principle, farmers are very grateful and nostalgic for the working cadres who once participated in land reform with them, and it can be said that they will never forget them in their lifetime. During the period you were with us, although we were not satisfied with you, we didn't blame you too much, because we knew that you were an old intellectual who had not been well reformed. I remember you once said that you wanted to interact with the people and learn from the people, and reform your thinking well. We thought that after five or six years, you had been reformed very well, but we didn't know that you were still the same as before, and getting more and more arrogant and blatant. Tell you, you need to have a very clear mind, and thoroughly criticize and strictly criticize your reactionary stance and views, and accept the criticisms and analyses of you from workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life.

　　对农民大发雷霆　斗地主躲躲闪闪
    储安平在土改中就露出反动立场
    江西省进贤县钟陵乡农民给储安平的公开信储安平先生：
    我们种田人文化不高，理论也少，但是谁好谁坏还能分辨得清楚。共产党为了人民，为了社会主义事业，决定在全国上下各级组织中进行整风，目的是为了克服某些党员和党组织中所犯有的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义。而你乘机企图挑拨群众起来反对共产党的领导。从你的发言里，我们感到你的确是很反动的，我们对你这种行为表示愤怒。
    你极端的仇恨共产党，我们却无比的爱戴共产党；你疯狂的反对社会主义，我们是衷心的拥护社会主义。我们爱戴共产党，拥护社会主义，并不是一句空话，是有理由的。你到过我们那里参加土改，解放前我们的生活状况，你已知道，那时候国民党反动派到处抓丁、派款，地主恶霸上门逼租逼债，特务土匪成天拦路打劫，只要一谈起过去所受的苦来，至今我们还要伤心落泪。汜塘村的三十二户农民中，只有两户算是没有讨过饭，不知道你还记得不？现在呢？情况完全改变了，今日的汜塘村，那有讨饭的人呢？都有中农生活水平了，就连无儿无女的孤老，都过得很好，进了农业社，享受了“五保”。南岸村过去由于国民党反动派的敲诈勒索，地主恶霸重租高利的盘剥，搞得根本不像个村庄，十几栋房子，不是上破下漏，就是东倒西歪的，现在也变了样，全村二十六户农民中，已有七户重新修整了房屋，还有两家人家盖了新房子。我们的农业社至今已经办了三年了，收成比以前好得多。去年所收的粮食折成谷子，比前年要多十八万多斤，按全社一千四百七十七个人照摊，每人可以增加一百二十二斤。今年我们的生产计划完成后，就更要多收粮食。几年以来，我们的生活水平提高得很快，这难道不是共产党领导得好吗？难道不是消灭了剥削的社会主义制度的好处吗？你要取消共产党的领导，要反对社会主义，我们根据自己的切身体验，看出只有共产党才是人民最好的带路人，只有社会主义制度才是最好的社会制度，所以我们坚决反对你那些恶毒的反对党的领导的言论。我们希望党在今后更要加强领导，领导全国人民更快更好的建设我们的社会主义国家。
    你仇恨共产党的领导，反对社会主义，这是你的反动的资产阶级立场的露骨的表现。你对资产阶级社会不仅是留恋不舍，而且存在着幻想和野心。提到这个问题，我们想拿你在我们这里土改时的情形来作一些可供参考的证明，你自己也可以回想一下。
    1952年1月到3月的两个多月中，你随中央政协土改团来到我们这里参加土改，成天的板起脸孔对待我们，动不动就发脾气，不采纳我们的意见。为了分田的事，你曾和农民胡结才吵嘴相骂。有一次分配地主的浮财，为了一口脚盆的分配不合你的意，你大发雷霆，拍桌子凶人，样子实在难看，群众见你害怕，背后骂你和强盗一样。你以为自己了不起，旧知识分子臭架子十足，根本不把我们种田人看在眼里，你和我们之间不仅有高墙，而且有大海隔着。可是你在对敌斗争上，总是缩头缩尾的，没有掌握过一次斗争会场（斗争会总是周尉文同志掌握）。我们在斗争地主，你就在会场旁边看看和溜溜。我们想了一下，你那次来我们这里根本谈不上参加土改，只是看了一看。看过以后，你的真实感觉怎样，你虽没有说出来，但我们比较了一下，觉得你的立场是大有问题的。这一点，今天也已得到了充分的证明。
    你会觉得我们无情吧！按照道理来说，农民对曾经和他们在一起参加过土改的工作干部，是十分感激和怀念的，可以说一辈子都不会忘记。你在我们那里的那一段时间里，我们虽然对你不满意，但是也并不怎样怪你，因为我们知道你是个没有改造好的旧知识分子。记得你曾说过要和人民群众来往，向人民群众学习，好好改造思想。我们以为事隔五、六年，你已改造得很好了，那晓得至今还是老样，而且越来越狂妄了，越露骨了。告诉你，你需要很好的清醒头脑，对自己的反动立场和观点作彻底的批判，作严格的批判，接受工人、农民以及各阶层人民对你的批评和分析。 　　　　 江西省进贤县钟陵乡钟陵高级社  胡保龙　胡有根　胡长根  万桂秀　张柳喜　李春荣  胡结印　支早兴
