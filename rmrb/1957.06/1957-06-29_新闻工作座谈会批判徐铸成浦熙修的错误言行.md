Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The news work symposium continued today and demanded that Xu Zhucheng, Pu Xixiu, and Chen Mingde make profound self-criticisms and replies.

　　Zhu Youqi of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China questioned at the meeting what was the relationship between Wenhui News and rightists such as Luo Longji? Yan Lu of Hebei Daily questioned the motive of Wenhui News for setting fires everywhere during the rectification campaign? What purpose was it trying to achieve? They all expressed indignation at Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu's repeated defense that Wenhui News had no relationship with Luo Longji. Zhu Youqi said that the Guangming Daily on June 26 published Ye Duyi's exposure of Luo Longji's speech on June 23, and Luo Longji also admitted that when Wenhui News was about to resume publication, he told Xu Zhucheng not to listen to the Party organization within Wenhui News, and to report any problems to Beijing; Luo Longji also hosted a large banquet for Wenhui News at his home. The Guangming Daily on June 26 also published Huang Qixiang's exposure: On June 9, Zhang Bojun said: "The situation has changed drastically these days, we must 'reel it in.' Pu Xixiu called me to ask: Should we notify Wenhui News?" This clearly shows that Wenhui News not only listened to Luo Longji's instructions, but also listened to Zhang Bojun's instructions. Zhu Youqi also said that Xu Zhucheng said that Wenhui News, in order to make the newspaper lively, vivid, and colorful, cultivated bourgeois journalistic viewpoints. Did being lively, vivid, and colorful have anything in common with attacking socialism?

　　Liu Guanwen of Renmin University of China asked Chen Mingde to answer what role Xinmin News played when bourgeois rightists attacked the Communist Party and the people. Liu Guanwen said that the Xinmin News published on May 15 Lin Fang's (Zhao Chaogou's pen name) essay "No Circles," which said that the great blooming and contending should not have a scope and opposed drawing a scope. Lin Fang's essay "Where are the Pioneers?" on May 13, the title indicated the reporter's grievances. The article said that now reporters "beg" (meaning begging for food), "bump," "摸摸 (grope)," and "拼 (fight)" to interview news, meaning that news freedom now is not as good as in the past. Lin Fang's essay "Local Bureaucrats" on May 28 advocated disrupting the Party's rectification steps and demanded that the rectification be pushed to the grassroots. Liu Guanwen said that if the Guangming Daily and Wenhui News were setting fires when bourgeois rightists attacked socialism, Xinmin News was at least fanning the flames for these arsonists. He asked Chen Mingde why he did not talk about Xinmin News in the anti-rightist struggle. He demanded that the person in charge of Xinmin News conduct a self-criticism on these and give an explanation to the people.

　　Yan Lu of Hebei Daily said at the meeting that socialist newspapers should guide work and criticize the rightist Chu Anping's fallacy that newspapers should "constantly expose" and that "analyzing contradictions and solving contradictions is not the task of newspapers." He also criticized Zhang Liqun, editor-in-chief of China Youth Daily, for saying that current newspapers are bulletin boards and gramophones, and therefore opposed the idea of socialist newspapers guiding work. He said that the Hebei Daily published the deeds of three poor peasants who insisted on running the cooperative, which greatly promoted agricultural cooperativization in the province; before that, it published the charter of the Geng Changsuo Cooperative and many cooperative management experiences, which helped agricultural cooperatives solve many problems in their work, and farmers loved these newspapers. Can it be said that the masses do not like to read articles that guide work? Yan Lu said that socialist newspapers should strengthen their guidance of work instead of weakening it. If socialist newspapers do not guide work, they will become greatly detached from the masses. As for the methods of guidance, they should be carefully studied, and newspapers should be lively and interesting, which is another issue. He also said that our newspapers, according to the Communist Party's consistent instructions, should conduct criticism and self-criticism to help solve contradictions among the people, but the rightists' "constant exposure" and "setting fires everywhere" were motivated by the desire to overthrow socialism.

　　Li Feng of Xinhua News Agency refuted the arguments of Zou Zhen and others for "democratic management of the agency" and "running a correspondent agency by colleagues." Li Feng said that Zou Zhen proposed that "democratic management of the agency" should first "reorganize the editorial board of Xinhua News Agency," and cadres should be subjected to "technical ranking," etc. Li Feng said that the state news agency is one of the superstructures, an important tool for the government to exercise dictatorship over the enemy and the people to exercise democratic rights, and an important tool for the Party and the government to educate the people. Zou Zhen's "democratic management of the agency" is actually to abolish the Party's leadership. Regarding the issue of running a "correspondent agency by colleagues," Li Feng said that this proposal was spoken in a hesitant manner; in fact, they wanted to run a news agency that was not led by the Communist Party and to compete with the news agency led by the Party. We sing socialism and support the leadership of the Communist Party, and they want to sing capitalism on another stage, detached from the leadership of the Communist Party. Li Feng also said that Zou Zhen slandered Xinhua News Agency's news as a complete mess, which was to sow discord in the people's news work front and to alienate the cooperative relationship between the news agency and newspapers and radio stations in doing a good job of propaganda.

　　An Gang, director of the Research Department of the All-China Journalists Association, criticized at the meeting the revisionist journalistic viewpoint represented by Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University. An Gang said: This journalistic viewpoint objectively played a certain role in responding to the rightists' attack and blurred the fighting direction of the people's newspapers. Wang Zhong believed that the relationship between newspapers and readers was a "five-cent" relationship, saying that newspapers can only play a role on the basis of commodities. He also said that newspapers are "useful only after they are bought," saying that newspapers should "adapt to social needs" in terms of buying and selling, and that Party newspapers that do not pay attention to the commodity nature of newspapers are "dogmatic," "widow-faced," and "official newspapers." It was on this viewpoint that Wang Zhong supported the Shanghai Xinmin News. An Gang said that our Party newspaper is the spokesperson of the people, and there is absolutely no buying and selling relationship with the people. The revisionist viewpoints of Wang Zhong and others are very harmful to the people's news undertaking.

　　At today's meeting, Zhang Longdong of the Journalism Department of Peking University criticized Mo Rujian's remarks, and Zhang Bo of the People's Shipping News criticized Zhao Qi's remarks.

　　The symposium will end tomorrow.

### 新闻工作座谈会批判徐铸成浦熙修的错误言行

　　新闻工作座谈会批判徐铸成浦熙修的错误言行
    新华社28日讯　新闻工作座谈会今天继续进行，并要求徐铸成、浦熙修、陈铭德作深刻的检查和答复。
    中国人民大学新闻系朱友石在会上质问文汇报和罗隆基等右派分子究竟是什么关系？河北日报的言鲁质问在整风中文汇报到处点火的动机是什么？要达到什么目的。他们都对徐铸成、浦熙修一再辩解文汇报和罗隆基没有关系表示愤慨。朱友石说，6月26日光明日报载叶笃义揭露罗隆基6月23日的谈话，罗隆基也承认，文汇报要复刊时，他曾叫徐铸成不要听文汇报内党组织的话，有事到北京来反映；罗隆基还曾在他家里为文汇报大宴宾客。6月26日光明日报还发表了黄琪翔的揭露：6月9日，章伯钧曾说：“这两天形势大变了，要‘收’了，浦熙修打电话问我：是不是要通知文汇报。”这很清楚地说明文汇报不仅听罗隆基的指示，而且还听章伯钧的指示。朱友石还说，徐铸成说文汇报为了使报纸生动活泼，丰富多采，因而滋长了资产阶级新闻观点，难道生动活泼，丰富多采和向社会主义进攻有什么共同之处吗？
    中国人民大学的刘贯文请陈铭德答复在资产阶级右派分子向共产党向人民进攻时新民报扮演一个怎样的角色。刘贯文说，5月15日新民报发表的林放（赵超构笔名）的随笔“没有圈圈”，说大鸣大放不应该有范围，而且反对划范围。5月13日林放的随笔“先锋何在”，题中标明是记者的不平鸣。文中说，现在记者采访新闻是“讨”（指讨饭）“碰”“摸”“拚”，意思是现在的新闻自由还不及过去的新闻自由。5月28日林放随笔“土官僚”里，主张打乱党的整风步骤，要求把整风推向基层。刘贯文说，如果说在资产阶级右派分子向社会主义进攻时，光明日报、文汇报是在放火，新民报起码也是在为这些放火者煽风。他问陈铭德在反右派斗争中为什么不谈新民报。他要求新民报的负责人对这些进行检查并向人民作交代。
    河北日报的言鲁在会上说，社会主义的报纸要指导工作，要批判右派分子储安平所谓报纸要“不断地揭露”和“分析矛盾解决矛盾不是报纸的任务”的谬论。他也批评了中国青年报总编辑张黎群关于现在的报纸是布告牌、留声机，因而反对社会主义报纸指导工作的说法。他说，河北日报发表了三户贫农坚持办社的事迹，大大推动了全省农业合作化；在这以前，发表了耿长锁合作社的社章和许多办社经验，帮助农业社解决了许多工作中的问题，农民对这些报纸爱不释手。能说一登指导工作的文章群众就不爱看吗？言鲁说，社会主义的报纸应该加强对工作的指导而不是削弱对工作的指导。社会主义报纸不指导工作就要大大脱离群众。至于指导的方法应该讲究，报纸要办得活泼有风趣，那是另外的问题。他还说，我们的报纸根据共产党历来的指示，就是要进行批评和自我批评，以帮助解决人民内部的矛盾，但右派分子以“不断揭露”、“到处放火”，动机却是想推翻社会主义。
    新华社的李峰批驳了邹震等提出的“民主办社”和“办同人通讯社”的论调。李峰说，邹震提出“民主办社”首先要“改组新华社的编委会”，干部要进行“技术排队”等等。李峰说，国家通讯社是上层建筑之一，是政府对敌人专政和人民行使民主权利的重要工具，是党和政府教育人民的重要工具。邹震的“民主办社”实际是要取消党的领导。关于办“同人通讯社”问题，李峰说，这个主张讲得吞吞吐吐；实际上，他们是要办不要共产党领导的通讯社，和党领导的通讯社唱对台戏。我们唱社会主义，拥护共产党领导，他们想在另一个台上唱资本主义，脱离共产党领导。李峰并说，邹震诬蔑新华社的新闻一团糟，是挑拨离间人民新闻工作战线，离间通讯社同报社和广播电台共同作好宣传工作的合作关系。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会研究部部长安岗在会上批判以复旦大学新闻系主任王中为代表的修正主义的新闻学观点。安岗说：这种新闻学观点在客观上同右派分子的进攻起了某种程度的策应作用，模糊了人民报纸的战斗方向。王中认为报纸同读者的关系是“五分钱”的关系，说什么报纸只有商品的基础才能发生作用。还说什么报纸是“买后才有用”，说报纸要在买卖这一点上“适应社会需要”，并且说不注意报纸商品性的党报是“一片教条主义”、“寡妇脸”、“官报”。正在这种观点上，王中就为上海新民报捧场。安岗说，我们的党报是人民的代言人，和人民绝不是买卖关系，王中等的这种修正主义的观点，对人民新闻事业的危害性是很大的。
    今天的会上还有北京大学新闻专业的张隆栋批判莫如俭的言论，人民航运报的张伯谈批评了赵琪的言论。
　　座谈会将在明天结束。
