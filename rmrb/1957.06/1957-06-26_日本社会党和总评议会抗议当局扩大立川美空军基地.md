　　Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The Japanese Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan dispatched representatives to the Defense Agency and the Tokyo Procurement Bureau today to protest the Procurement Bureau's surveying of land belonging to residents of Sunagawa Town in order to expand the U.S. Tachikawa Air Force Base.
　　The Tokyo Procurement Bureau, which handles affairs related to U.S. military facilities, has announced that it will formally begin surveying 44,000 square yards of land belonging to local residents starting on July 8th, and will begin preparations for the survey tomorrow.
　　The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations held a joint meeting this afternoon to discuss measures to oppose the government's surveying of land in Sunagawa Town. The meeting decided to hold a mass rally in Sunagawa Town with the participation of one thousand workers and students to protest the government's actions.
　　At the request of the United States, the Japanese government attempted to forcibly survey land belonging to residents of Sunagawa Town from 1955 in order to expand the U.S. Tachikawa Air Force Base. However, due to strong opposition from the people of Sunagawa Town and all sectors of Japanese society, the government's survey work has not been fully completed. Last autumn, the people of Sunagawa Town, disregarding police suppression, drove away the government survey teams several times, finally forcing the government to halt the survey work.

　　日本社会党和总评议会抗议当局扩大立川美空军基地
    新华社25日讯  日本社会党和日本工会总评议会今天派代表到防卫厅和东京调达局，抗议调达局为扩大美国立川空军基地而测量砂川町居民的土地。
    处理美国军事设施事务的东京调达局已经宣布，它要从7月8日开始正式测量当地居民的四万四千平方码的土地，并从明天开始进行测量的准备工作。
    日本工会总评议会和全日本学生自治会总联合会今天下午举行联席会议，讨论了反对政府测量砂川町土地的措施。会议决定要在砂川町召开有一千名工人、学生参加的群众大会，抗议政府的行动。
    在美国的要求下，日本政府从1955年就曾经企图强制测量砂川町居民的土地来扩大美国立川空军基地。但是，由于砂川町和日本各阶层人民的强烈反对，政府的测量工作一直未能全部完成。去年秋天，砂川町人民不顾警察的镇压，曾经数次赶走了政府的测量队，最后终于迫使政府停止测量工作。
