Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: On the evening of the 23rd, Mei Lanfang, together with Kunqu Opera artists Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng, collaborated in Beijing to perform two scenes, "The Garden Stroll" and "The Dream Interrupted," from the Kunqu Opera "The Peony Pavilion." This marks the first collaboration between these three artists in their decades of acquaintance.

The sum of their ages is one hundred and eighty years, and each has been active on stage for four or five decades. Through their graceful singing and dancing, they revived their youth. Mei Lanfang's Du Liniang was dignified and delicate; Han Shichang's Chunxiang was lively and clever; and Bai Yunsheng's Liu Mengmei was dashing and romantic. They successfully brought this masterpiece by Tang Xianzu to the stage.

Many audience members described this extraordinary performance as a "perfect match."

After the performance, Chen Yi, Kang Sheng, and Qian Junrui, who attended the show, went backstage to express their appreciation to the three artists and the entire cast.

　　梅兰芳、韩世昌、白云生首次合作演出“牡丹亭”
    据新华社24日讯　23日晚，梅兰芳和昆曲表演艺术家韩世昌、白云生在北京合作演出昆曲“牡丹亭”里的两折“游园、惊梦”。这是这三位艺术家相识几十年来的第一次合作。
    他们三人年龄的总和是一百八十岁，都已经在舞台上活跃了四、五十年。他们在清歌曼舞之中，使自己的青春再现。梅兰芳的杜丽娘端庄娇柔；韩世昌的春香活泼伶俐；白云生的柳梦梅风流倜傥。他们把汤显祖的这一杰作成功地搬上了舞台。
    许多观众用“珠联璧合”来形容这场不平凡的好戏。
    演出结束之后，前来看戏的陈毅、康生、钱俊瑞都到后台向三位艺术家和全体演员致意。
