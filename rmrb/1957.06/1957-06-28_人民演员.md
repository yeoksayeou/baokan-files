　　People's Actor (Sketch)
    Narasidze is a famous Soviet soprano soloist. In order for me to choose a pose, she sang and performed at the same time. We jointly selected this pose.
    She was as happy as a lark. During the painting process, she kept singing. When she was immersed in her singing, it seemed that she was not facing a painter, but an audience filling the theater.
    The more vivid the subject, the happier the painter. I spent more than an hour completing this sketch. She liked it very much and signed her nickname on the painting.

　　人民演员（素描）
    娜拉西泽是苏联有名的女高音独唱家。为了让我选定一个姿态，她一面歌唱，一面表演。我们共同选定了这个姿态。
    她像百灵鸟一样快乐。在画的过程中，也不断地唱着歌儿。唱到忘情处，好像面前不是一个画家，而是坐满了剧场的听众。
    对象愈生动，画家愈高兴。我花了一个多小时完成了这幅素描。她很喜欢，在画上签上了自己的小名。
