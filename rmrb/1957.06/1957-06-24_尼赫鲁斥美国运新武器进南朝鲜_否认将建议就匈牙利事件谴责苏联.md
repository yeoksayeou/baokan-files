Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, Oslo dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Sweden on the 22nd from Norway. He will pay a three-day visit to Sweden.

Before leaving Norway, Nehru held a press conference in Oslo, where he spoke about the recent efforts by all parties to ban nuclear weapons testing. He said that nuclear weapons testing should be banned immediately.

Nehru condemned the United States' decision to ship modern weapons to South Korea, saying: "The dispersal of 'so-called tactical nuclear weapons' around the world is really a bad thing." "These weapons will spread the seeds of violence and discord."

Nehru once again spoke about the friendly relations between India and China. He said that the Indian people have friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. Indians are not greatly concerned about the current relations between India and China.

At the press conference, Nehru refuted a fabrication by the British "Daily Mail." The "Daily Mail" published a report on the 21st, saying that Nehru was "shocked" by a report issued on June 18th by the United Nations "Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary," which distorted the truth of the Hungarian incident, and that he intended to propose that the United Nations condemn the Soviet Union at the upcoming Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Nehru said: "The 'Daily Mail' report is completely fabricated. Yesterday (21st) morning, I had not even seen the summary of this report. What I know today (22nd) is entirely from brief newspaper reports."

Nehru also reiterated his views on the Hungarian incident. He believes that in Hungary, a "rebellion" was suppressed, and thus it was a "tragedy." However, he also said that the Hungarian situation is mainly a problem for the Hungarian people, and he expressed his opposition to using the Hungarian incident to carry out great power struggles.

　　尼赫鲁斥美国运新武器进南朝鲜
    否认将建议就匈牙利事件谴责苏联
    据新华社23日讯　奥斯陆消息：印度总理尼赫鲁22日从挪威到达瑞典。他将在瑞典作三天的访问。
    尼赫鲁在离开挪威之前在奥斯陆举行了记者招待会，他谈到最近各方进行的禁止核武器试验的努力。他说，应该立刻禁止核武器试验。
    尼赫鲁斥责了美国决定把现代武器运到南朝鲜去的做法，他说：把“所谓的战术原子武器散布到世界各地去实在是一件坏事。”“这种武器将散布暴力和不和的种子。”
    尼赫鲁又一次谈到印度同中国的友谊关系。他说，印度人民对中国人有友好的感情。印度人对印度同中国的目前关系没有多大不安。
    在招待会上，尼赫鲁驳斥了英国“每日邮报”捏造的一条消息。21日的“每日邮报”刊载消息说，尼赫鲁对联合国“匈牙利问题特别委员会”6月18日发表的一份歪曲匈牙利事件真象的报告很“震惊”，说他打算在即将举行的英联邦总理会议上建议联合国谴责苏联。尼赫鲁说：“‘每日邮报’的消息完全是捏造的。昨天（21日）上午，我甚至还没有看到这个报告的摘要。我今天（22日）所知道的内容完全是我从简短的报纸消息中看到的。”
    尼赫鲁同时申述了他对匈牙利事件的看法。他认为，在匈牙利，一次“起义”受到了镇压，因而是一个“悲剧”。不过，他又说，匈牙利局势主要是匈牙利人民的问题，他表示反对利用匈牙利事件来进行大国斗争的做法。
