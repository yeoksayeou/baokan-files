    Important Issues in Current Handicraft Production

    Handicraft products play an important role in the daily necessities of the broad masses of people in both urban and rural areas, and the public is very concerned about their supply. Since the second half of last year, the prices of some handicraft products have risen. It is estimated that the value of handicraft products with increased prices accounts for about 10%-15% of the total output value of handicrafts nationwide, and the price increase is generally around 20% on average in various places. This indicates that some contradictions have arisen between the supply of handicrafts and market demand, and these contradictions should be resolved.

    Why have these handicraft products increased in price? The main reason is the rise in the price of some raw materials purchased on the market. For example, the average price of scrap wrought iron used by handicrafts in Xi'an was 120 yuan per ton in the first half of last year, rising to 160 yuan in the fourth quarter, and further to about 300 yuan in the first quarter of this year. The price of local iron in various places generally increased by 25%-30% from the third quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. A survey of three counties and cities, including Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, showed that the average price of Mao bamboo was 8 jiao 9 fen per stalk last year, rising to 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen on average in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 30%. The prices of other local specialty raw materials have also increased to varying degrees in various places.

    The main reason for the increase in raw material prices is that supply cannot meet demand. The raw materials for handicrafts mainly come from three sources: materials supplied by the state, agricultural and sideline products purchased from rural areas, and waste products and scrap materials purchased from urban and rural areas, especially from industrial and mining enterprises. Last year, there was a large demand for raw materials for state capital construction and agricultural cooperatives' capital construction, especially for steel, wood, and bamboo, so some raw materials that could be used for handicraft production were used for capital construction, and the supply of certain raw materials for handicrafts became difficult. At the same time, many production departments also used waste products and scrap materials due to insufficient raw materials, making the supply of waste products and scrap materials also tight, and the prices of some varieties increased. Among agricultural raw materials, such as cotton and hemp, production was greatly reduced last year due to disasters, resulting in insufficient supply. For some agricultural and sideline specialty raw materials, the demand for raw materials for sideline production, especially in disaster areas, increased due to the large-scale development of sideline production in rural areas in the second half of last year. On the other hand, due to social needs, the total output value of handicraft production increased by about 15% in 1956 compared with 1955, and the demand for raw materials also increased accordingly. In addition, the arrangement and distribution of some raw materials between regions were improper, such as hides and miscellaneous wood, which were often in relatively abundant supply in the producing areas, but in short supply in other places. These are all reasons for the tight supply of raw materials for handicrafts and the resulting price increases.

    Poor management by handicraft cooperatives is also one of the reasons for the increase in product prices. After handicraft workers participate in handicraft cooperatives, it is appropriate to gradually increase wages and benefits on the basis of developing production. However, some cooperatives have not increased or have not increased labor productivity much, but wages have increased more, which has increased product costs. Some cooperatives have too many non-productive personnel, poor management, do not pay attention to saving raw materials and expenses, and some even have extravagance and waste, and some increase profits, which all affect the increase in costs and product prices. In addition, the supply of handicraft products in some areas is insufficient, leading to price gouging, and the relevant departments sometimes do not strictly manage product prices, which is also related to the increase in the prices of handicraft products.

    Generally speaking, the relevant state departments have made arrangements for the main raw materials needed by handicrafts this year. For example, the planned supply of steel can reach 740,000 tons, which is equivalent to 94% of the actual supply last year. Among them, state allocation and supply by commercial departments account for 36%, local iron supplied by handicraft cooperatives and local industries accounts for 22%, and waste steel purchased by various places for handicrafts accounts for about 42%. The supply of wood can reach 4.7 million cubic meters, of which 2.2 million cubic meters are allocated by the state and supplied by commercial departments, and 2.5 million cubic meters are purchased locally by various places. Due to excessive felling of large Mao bamboo under unified state management last year, which hindered the production and development of bamboo forests, and the development and construction of new bamboo forests takes time, the estimated purchase volume this year is 15%-20% less than last year, which poses difficulties for the supply of handicrafts in some non-producing areas; small Mao bamboo and other bamboos are not currently lacking. Although the output or purchase volume of cotton yarn, wool, raw hides, etc. uniformly distributed by the state decreased last year, arrangements have been made for handicrafts. In addition, there are many and complex varieties of agricultural and sideline specialty raw materials such as reeds, grass, brambles, and willow branches, as well as various waste products and scrap materials, and there are many departments that need them. Therefore, further arrangements are needed in the purchase, supply, and price management.

    Generally speaking, the quantity of raw materials directly allocated by the state and supplied by commercial departments is guaranteed, and the prices are stable. The proportion of raw materials needed by handicrafts that are directly allocated and supplied by the state is less than half, except for industries such as cotton knitting and sewing, while the quantity of raw materials obtained from the free market is larger and the varieties are more numerous. In the supply of raw materials to handicrafts, there are contradictions between handicrafts and large industries, between handicrafts and agricultural and sideline industries, between the supply of commercial departments and production needs, and between regions. It is still an arduous task for various places to solve the difficulties in the raw materials needed by handicrafts and stabilize the prices of handicraft products. Therefore, the following work must be done well:

    First, the Party committees and governments at all levels must further check and urge the relevant departments to do a good job in the allocation and supply of raw materials for handicrafts, promptly solve the difficulties in the supply of raw materials for handicrafts, and better arrange handicraft production to meet social needs. The raw materials that have been approved for planned supply by the state should be promptly checked for their implementation. The raw materials that are determined to be supplied by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce through the market should be distributed and organized for supply separately according to production needs and raw material conditions. The supply of bamboo and wood should be given priority to meet the needs of handicraft production; the supply of steel should take into account the needs of handicrafts, daily necessities industries, and small agricultural tool production; although hemp and raw lacquer mainly meet the needs of large industries, handicrafts should also be taken care of, and the quantity supplied to handicrafts should be determined and actively organized for supply. For those raw materials that are in short supply, the spirit of giving priority to production, then to capital construction, and of producing areas taking care of sales areas should be implemented. The purchase and supply of waste products and scrap materials should be uniformly arranged by the local authorities except for materials purchased uniformly by the state. Supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives should cooperate closely. At present, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives are studying specific measures.

    Second, agricultural and handicraft production have always supported and depended on each other. In the future, agriculture and handicrafts should better support each other. From the analysis of the sources of raw materials needed by handicrafts, most of them are agricultural and sideline products, such as bamboo, wood, hemp, palm, rattan, and grass; the production and daily necessities needed by farmers are mostly handicraft products; therefore, it can be seen that, on the one hand, the supply and prices of agricultural and sideline products needed by handicrafts have a great impact on handicraft production; on the other hand, the supply and prices of handicraft products have a close relationship with the production and life of farmers; mutual support and development of production between farmers and handicraft workers is very important. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate farmers to actively respond to and first complete the purchase tasks put forward by the state, and actively sell their products at reasonable prices. This plays an important role in the planned and proportionate distribution between large industry and handicrafts, as well as between regions. When sideline handicraft production and professional handicraft production have conflicts due to insufficient raw materials, the principle of sideline handicrafts taking care of local professional handicrafts and urban handicrafts should be adopted.

    Third, the management departments of handicrafts at all levels and the federations of handicraft cooperatives at all levels must further carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, strengthen production leadership, improve management, and reduce expenses. On the premise of ensuring product quality, attention should be paid to saving raw materials, rationally using substitutes, and reducing product costs. It is necessary to actively develop raw material resources and organize the supply of raw materials, and effectively prevent the blind development of industries with raw material difficulties. Market conditions and consumer opinions should be investigated and studied frequently. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of handicraft workers, and constantly pay attention to overcoming capitalist management ideas and styles. It should also cooperate with the competent departments to control and manage the prices of handicraft products.

    手工业当前生产中的重要问题
    手工业产品在城乡广大人民生活日用品中占着重要地位，它的供应情况，群众十分关心。去年下半年以来，手工业产品的价格有一部分上涨。估计全国涨价的手工业产品的产值约占手工业总产值的10％—15％，涨价的幅度各地一般平均在20％左右。这就说明了手工业品的供应和市场需要之间发生了若干矛盾，这个矛盾应该设法予以解决。
    这些手工业品为什么会涨价呢？主要的原因是在市场采购的一部分原材料涨价。如西安市手工业所用的废熟铁，去年上半年每吨平均一百二十元，第四季度涨至一百六十元，今年第一季度又涨至三百元左右。各地土铁价格从去年第三季度到今年第一季度，一般也涨价25％—30％。江西省南昌等三个县市的调查，毛竹价格去年平均每根八角九分，到今年一季度平均涨至一元一角六分，上涨30％。其他土产原料的价格，各地也有不同程度的上涨。
    原料涨价的主要原因是供不应求。手工业的原料大体来自三个方面：即国家供应的物资，向农村收购的农副产品，向城镇、农村、特别是向工矿企业收购的废品废料。去年国家基本建设和农业合作社的基本建设用的原材料较多，特别是钢铁、木、竹用的多，使一部分可以用于手工业生产的原料，用到了基本建设方面，手工业的某些原材料的供应发生了困难。同时，许多生产部门由于原料不足，又去利用废品废料，使得废品废料供应也紧张，而且有些品种的价格上涨。农产品原料中如棉花、麻等，去年因遭灾减产很多，供应不足。有的农副土产原料，因去年下半年农村大量开展副业生产，特别是灾区，副业性手工业需要的原料增加。另一方面，由于社会的需要，手工业生产总值在1956年比1955年约增加了15％左右，原料的需要量也随之增加。加上有些原料地区间安排和分配不当，如皮张、杂木等，往往是产地供应比较充足，而外地却十分缺乏。这些都是手工业原料供应紧张而造成涨价的原因。
    手工业合作社经营管理不善也是产品涨价的原因之一。手工业劳动者参加手工业合作社以后，在发展生产的基础上，逐步地提高工资福利是应该的。但是，有些合作社劳动生产率提高不多或并未提高，而工资增加较多，这就增加了产品成本。有些合作社脱产人员过多，经营管理不善，对于原材料和开支不注意节约，有些还有铺张浪费的现象，有些提高利润，都影响了成本的加大和产品价格的上涨。加上有的地区的手工业产品供应不足，抬价抢购，有关部门对产品价格有时管理不严，这对于手工业品的涨价也是有关系的。
    今年对手工业所需要的主要原料，总的说来，国家有关部门已作了安排。如钢铁安排供应可以达到七十四万吨，相当于去年实际供应量的94％，其中国家调拨和商业部门供应的占36％，手工业合作社和地方工业生产的土铁供应占22％，各地收购的废钢铁供应手工业的约占42％。木材的供应可以达到四百七十万立方公尺，其中由国家调拨和商业部门供应的是二百二十万立方公尺，由各地方就地收购的有二百五十万立方公尺。竹材因国家统一管理的大毛竹去年砍伐过多，妨害了竹林的生产发展，新竹林的开发和建设又需时间，今年收购量估计比去年减少15％—20％，对于有些非产区的手工业供应上有困难；小毛竹和其他竹子，目前并不缺乏。国家统一分配的棉纱、羊毛、原皮等，去年产量或收购量虽然减少，但对手工业已作了安排。此外，苇、草、荆条、柳条等农副土产原料以及各种废品废料品种多而复杂，需要的部门也多，因此在收购和供应以及价格的管理上都还需要进一步的安排。
    照一般的情况说，国家直接分配和商业部门负责供应的手工业原料，在数量上是有保证的，在价格上是稳定的。手工业所需原料，由国家直接分配和供应的所占比重，除棉针织、缝纫等行业以外，都不足一半，而从自由市场上取得的原料数量较大，品种较多。在对手工业的原料供应中，手工业与大工业之间，手工业与农副业之间，商业部门的供应与生产需要之间，地区与地区之间，都存在着这样或那样的矛盾。各地对于解决手工业需要原料的困难，稳定手工业产品的价格，还是一项艰巨的任务。因此必须做好以下工作：
    第一，各地党委、政府必须进一步检查和督促有关部门做好手工业原料的分配和供应工作，及时地解决手工业原料供应的困难，更好地安排手工业生产，以便适应社会需要。国家已批准计划供应的原料，应当及时检查执行的情况。确定由国营商业和合作社商业通过市场负责供应的原料，应当根据生产需要和原料情况，有分别地进行分配和组织供应。竹、木的供应，要尽先满足手工业生产需要；钢铁的供应，要兼顾手工业和日用品工业以及小农具生产的需要；麻、生漆虽然主要满足大工业，也要照顾手工业，同时应该确定对手工业的供应数量并积极组织供应。对那些供应不足的原料，应该贯彻先供生产、再供基建和产区照顾销区的精神。废品废料的收购和供应，今后除国家统购物资以外，其它废品废料由地方上统一安排。供销社同手工业合作社应当密切协作。目前全国供销合作总社和全国手工业合作总社筹委会正在研究具体的措施。
    第二，农业和手工业生产历来都是互相支援、互相依赖的。今后农业和手工业应当更好的互相支援。从手工业所需要的原料的来源分析，绝大部分是农副土产品，如竹、木、麻、棕、藤、草等；农民需要的生产和生活日用品，又绝大部分是手工业产品；因此，可以看出，一方面手工业所需农副土产原料的供应和价格，对手工业生产有很大的影响；另一方面，手工业产品的供应和价格，对农民的生产和生活又有密切的关系；农民和手工业劳动者的相互支援、发展生产，是十分重要的。同时还必须教育农民积极地响应和首先完成国家提出的收购任务，按照合理的价格积极地出售自己的产品。这对大工业与手工业以及地区之间有计划地按比例分配，有着重大的作用。在副业手工业生产和专业手工业生产由于原料不足而发生矛盾的时候，应当采取副业手工业照顾当地的专业手工业和城市手工业的原则。
    第三，各级手工业的管理部门和各级手工业联社必须进一步开展增产节约运动，加强生产领导，改善经营，减少费用开支。在保证产品质量的前提下，要注意节约原材料，合理地利用代用品，降低产品成本。要积极地开发原料资源和组织原料的供应，并切实防止原料困难行业的盲目发展。对市场情况和消费者的意见，应经常进行调查研究。同时必须加强对手工业劳动者的政治思想教育，经常注意克服资本主义的经营思想作风。还应当配合主管部门掌握和管理手工业产品价格。
