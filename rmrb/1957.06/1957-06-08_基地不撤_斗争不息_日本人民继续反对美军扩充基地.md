According to Japanese newspaper reports: Amidst the rising anger of the Japanese people over the killing of a Japanese farmer's wife by a US soldier, residents in various parts of Japan are continuously carrying out struggles against the expansion of US military bases.

On May 25, over 700 workers, farmers, and citizens from Fukuoka City gathered in the rain to protest the expansion of the Itazuke Air Base by the US military authorities. Representatives from various sectors spoke, protesting the US military authorities' disregard for the just demands of the Japanese people, and expressed their determination to unite and wage a resolute struggle for peace and independence. The monks from the Japan Myohoji Temple, who were collecting signatures on the streets against hydrogen bomb testing, also came to the meeting, calling on the participants to "have the courage of the residents of Sunagawa Town and advance hand in hand with the peace-loving people of the world." The assembly issued protest letters to the Japanese Prime Minister and the Commander of the US Far East Command. After the meeting, the masses marched in formation to the local US consulate to demonstrate their protest.

The residents of Sunagawa Town, who fought bravely last autumn against the expansion of the US military base, have recently launched protests against the construction of housing and the encroachment on land by the US military in the area. The US military authorities plan to build housing near Sunagawa Town Middle School, incorporating a large amount of land into the base, which will not only hinder local traffic but also seriously affect school classes. The mothers of students at Sunagawa Town Middle School recently held a meeting, determined to fight to protect their children's studies. The mayor of Sunagawa Town, Miyazaki, said that the construction of housing by the US military has been opposed by teachers and mothers, and it is impossible to obtain the consent of the town government.

The residents of Tokai Village in Ibaraki Prefecture and Katsuta and Nakaminato cities have recently been strongly calling for the US military to remove its bombing range. The US Air Force often conducts bombing exercises in this area, and the terrifying roar of rapidly ascending jet aircraft disrupts the peaceful lives of local residents. Bombs dropped from US military aircraft often land in farmhouses and fields around the training ground, damaging houses and crops. Such incidents have occurred twenty-three times in the last three months. Last spring, the Katsuta City Council passed a resolution demanding the removal of the US military training ground, and recently the city, led by the mayor, has once again demanded the removal of the training ground.

### 基地不撤　斗争不息  日本人民继续反对美军扩充基地

    基地不撤　斗争不息
    日本人民继续反对美军扩充基地
    本报综合报道　据日本报纸消息：在日本人民群起抗议美国兵杀死日本农妇的愤怒声中，日本各地居民不断地开展了反对美军扩充军事基地的斗争。
    5月25日，福冈市工人、农民和市民等七百多人冒雨集会，抗议美军当局扩充板付基地。各界代表发言，抗议美军当局无视日本国民的正义要求，表示要团结起来为和平和独立进行坚决的斗争。为反对氢弹试验在街头征求签名的日本山妙法寺的和尚也赶来赴会，号召与会者“要同砂川町的居民一样有勇气，和世界爱好和平的人民携手前进”。大会向日本首相、美国远东军司令官发出抗议书。会后，群众并列队前往当地美国领事馆示威抗议。
    曾在去年秋天为反对美军扩大基地而英勇斗争的砂川町居民，最近又为反对美军在当地扩建住宅、侵占土地而展开抗议活动。美军当局计划在砂川町中学附近修建住宅，把大量的土地划入基地范围之内，不仅有碍当地交通，并且将严重地影响学校上课。砂川町中学学生的母亲们最近举行了集会，决心为保卫孩子们的学习而斗争。砂川町町长宫崎说，美军修建住宅已遭到教员和母亲们的反对，要想得到町政府的同意也是不可能的。
    茨城县东海村和胜田、那珂凑两市的居民，要求美军撤除投弹演习场的呼声，最近也在强烈起来。美国空军常在这一地区进行投弹演习，急骤上升的喷气式飞机发出的恐怖吼声，扰乱了当地居民和平生活；美军飞机上投下的炸弹，常常落在演习场周围的农家和田地里，毁坏了房屋和庄稼。在最近三个月内这样的事情就发生了二十三次。去年春天，胜田市议会作出了要求撤除美军演习场的决议，最近该市以市长为首又提出了撤除演习场的要求。（附图片）
    砂川町的妇女们欢呼“胜利万岁！”
