Thoughts on an Untitled Poem
Zhong Huai

Some say that the working class entered socialism empty-handed, while the bourgeoisie entered socialism with gifts.

That the bourgeoisie is willing to enter socialism, and with "gifts," is naturally something to be proud of. But if one can calmly and seriously think about where these "gifts" come from, one will discover who truly "entered socialism empty-handed" and who entered with "gifts."

＊

Since there are people in society who gain without labor, there must be people who labor without gain, or labor much but gain little.

Is "unearned income" exploitation? It's best to ask those who labor without gain or labor much but gain little!

＊

"The stick is coming again!"

Some who say this are truly threatened by the stick, and therefore cry out loudly to express their indignation.

Some have not actually been hit by the stick, but have only been criticized. The reason they shout "The stick is coming again!" is simply: I can criticize you, but you cannot criticize me.

＊

It is certainly not good for only one flower to bloom or only one voice to be heard.

What if ninety-nine kinds of flowers bloom, but only one kind does not; or ninety-nine voices are heard, but only one is silent?

In the eyes of some people, only in this way is there "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend."

    有人说，工人阶级是空着手走进社会主义的，资产阶级则是带着礼物走进社会主义的。
    资产阶级愿意走进社会主义，而且带着“礼物”，自然是值得骄傲的。可是如果能够冷静地、认真地想一想这份“礼物”是从哪儿来的，就会发现究竟谁是真正地“空着手走进社会主义”的，谁又是带着“礼物”走进社会主义的了。

    社会上既然有人不劳而获，就一定有人劳而不获，或者多劳少获。
    “不劳而获的收入”是不是剥削呢？最好去问问那些劳而不获、多劳少获的人吧！
      ＊
    “棍子又来了！”
    说这话的，有人是真正受到了棍子的威胁，因此大声疾呼，表示愤慨。
    有人其实并没有挨棍子，只不过受到了批评。其所以要嚷嚷“棍子又来了”，用意无非是：只能我批评你，不能你批评我。
     ＊
    一花独放，一家独鸣，当然不好。
    九十九种花都放，独有一花不放；九十九家都鸣，独有一家不鸣，又如何呢？
    在某些人看来，唯有这样，才是“百花齐放，百家争鸣”。
