　　My aunt was a widow in her fifties, living alone, with no one else in her family. Although she had bound feet, she had to walk a great deal every day, rain or shine, in order to earn a little bit of interest.

　　My aunt was the "head" of a "money club." The money club consisted of dozens of people, each contributing a very small amount of money to the head every day. A draw was held every ten days, and whoever won the draw got to use the money, with the head earning a small commission. These people were all poor and didn't have much money, so they formed the club to pool their resources. My aunt, as the head, went around collecting money every day, also to earn a bit of money herself.

　　One day, after finishing lunch, my aunt went out to collect money. I noticed she was a bit unhappy because the payments weren't complete that morning. I asked to go with her, worried she might get even more upset. My mother said, "Don't go, stay home and watch the children for me, I still have work to do!" My aunt loved me the most and wanted to take me with her, saying, "Let her go, Da Ni is like your crutch, you can't do without her for a moment. But I'm old, every day is one day less, who knows when I'll die!" With that, she grabbed my hand and we went out. After walking several streets, we arrived at Jiudao Bay Alley to collect money, only to get a bellyful of anger. Some said, "I don't have money today, the Japanese ride rickshaws and don't pay, they even beat people." Others said, "I can't even get enough to eat! How can I pay? I don't even know when I'll die!" There was also a middle-aged man my aunt asked: "Is your money easy to come by? Does it just come from turning the wheels of your cart! If you don't pay, can I not give you the money when it's your turn?" The man said, "Aunt, I just got out, so many people in my family are sick, haven't you heard? If you catch someone stealing from trains, they get shot! I can't pay now, I really don't have the money." This man had just been released from prison. He used to travel to places like Xuzhou to do business, but he was robbed by pickpockets on the train and couldn't continue his business. Later, he himself became a pickpocket, stealing from others.

　　My aunt was walking along, feeling angry, when several Japanese soldiers came riding on horseback. Suddenly, one of the horses got spooked! My aunt grabbed me and we ran as fast as we could. Luckily, there was an alley and we went in. The spooked horse, with its tail straight up, kept following us. My aunt pushed me away and said, "Run!" I turned and ran. At that moment, my aunt, unable to escape the horse, ran into a courtyard. The horse followed her in, and several Japanese soldiers arrived at the gate, blocking anyone from coming out.

　　In Tianjin, many families lived in large courtyards with shared cooking stoves. Each family had firewood stacked in the yard. The horse ran around wildly, knocking over the firewood next to the gate, which fell onto the stoves and caught fire. The Japanese soldiers didn't dare enter the courtyard and stood at the gate shouting like wild beasts, not allowing anyone to put out the fire. In a short time, the sky turned red! I was so scared I hid to the side, not knowing what to do! Someone cried and went home.

　　My mother complained, "I told you not to go! You always cause trouble! See what happened!" I myself regretted it, I shouldn't have gone with my aunt. My aunt didn't come back all night. The next day, my father found out that none of the thirty-odd people in the courtyard had escaped, and they had all been burned to death. The Japanese soldiers guarded the fire scene, and no one dared to approach to identify the bodies. I saw one burned person, with a copper thimble on the middle finger of their hand, still tightly holding the copper box for the money club! That was my aunt.

　　My aunt was kind and very strong-willed throughout her life. She was never idle, always working hard, trying to make a living. She never treated anyone unfairly, she had done nothing wrong, and yet in that brutal old society, she met such a tragic end. I feel sad whenever I think of my aunt, and I regret that I shouldn't have gone with her to collect money. Especially during festivals, I miss my aunt, she never had a good day in her life!

　　姑妈
　　新凤霞
    姑妈是个五十多岁的寡妇，独自一个，家里什么人都没有。她虽然是两只小脚，为了得来一点点利钱，每天要走很多很多路，不管刮大风、下大雨，每天如此。
    姑妈是“攒钱会”的“会头”。攒钱会是几十个人组成的，每天每人拿出极少的钱交给会头，十天摇会一次，谁得会，谁使钱，会头从中得一分利。这些人都是贫苦人，没有整钱，打会为的是凑出整钱。我姑妈是会头每天到各处打会，也为的是得点钱。
    有一天，吃完晌午饭，姑妈出去打会。我看姑妈有点不高兴，因为上午会打的不齐，我要求跟着去，耽心她再生气。我母亲说：“你别去吧，在家还是给我看会孩子，我还有活哪！”姑妈最疼我，愿意带我出去，说：“叫她去吧，大妮就像是你的拐棍一会离不开，她走了你就缺了扶手？可是我老了，跟一天少一天，不定哪天就死了！”说着拉我手就出去了。走出了几条街，到了九道湾胡同打会，结果生了一肚子气，有的说：“今天没钱，日本人坐洋车不给钱，还打人。”有的说：“饭都吃不饱！还打会？我命还不知哪天送哪！”还有一个中年男人，我姑妈问他：“你的钱来得容易啊？车轮一转就来钱哪！你也不打会，十天到了我不给得会的钱行吗？”那人说：“大姑我才出来，家里病着这么多人，您没听说吗？抓着吃大轮的（火车上偷东西的）就枪毙呀！会是不能打了，实在没钱。”这人才出狱，原来是专门跑徐州等地作生意、被火车上小偷偷得没法作买卖，后来他自己改行作小偷偷别人。
    姑妈一边生气一边走，迎面来了几个日本兵骑着马，忽然有一匹马惊了！姑妈拉着我就紧跑，正好有个胡同我们就进去了，这匹惊马竖着尾巴一直的跟在我们后头，姑妈把我撒开了说：“跑开！”我转身就跑。这时姑妈被马追得走不了，进了一家院子。马也跟着进去了，几个日本兵到了门口堵住不许任何人出来。
    天津烧灶锅，大杂院人家很多，每家都有柴火，一捆捆的摆在院里。马进去乱跑乱撞把大门两旁的柴火碰倒了，正交叉倒在灶锅上起了火。日本兵也不敢进院子，站在门前像野兽似的乱嚷，也不许别人进去救火。一会工夫天都红了！吓得我躲在一边不知怎么是好了！一人哭着就回家了。
    母亲埋怨我说：“不叫你跟去！你非跟去添累赘不可！出事了吧！”我自己也后悔了，不该跟着姑妈去。姑妈一夜都没回来。第二天父亲打听来，这院子三十多口人一个都没有出来，就这样无辜地都给烧死了。日本人守着火场，认尸的人都不敢上前。我看见一个烧死的人带着铜顶针的中指的手里还紧拿着那个打攒钱会的铜印盒哪！那就是我的姑妈。
    姑妈一生善良，非常要强。一会也不闲着，老是作活，勤勤恳恳的为了吃饭奔走。她从没亏待过人，她一点罪也没有，在那个残暴的旧社会里她得到的结果是这样悲惨。想起姑妈我就难过，我就后悔，我不应该跟她出去打会。特别是逢年过节时我就想念姑妈，她一天好日子都没过呀！
