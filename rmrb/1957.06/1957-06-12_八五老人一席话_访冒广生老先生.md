　　A Word from an Eighty-Five-Year-Old
　　——An Interview with Elder Mr. Mao Guangsheng
　　By Our Reporter Fu Dong

　　The People's Daily published an article by Mao Guangsheng on June 6, titled: "A Few Opinions on the Current Rectification Campaign." After the article was published, some readers wrote to say they would like to know more about this eighty-five-year-old man.

　　We learned from others that Mao Guangsheng is from Rugao, Jiangsu Province. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations during the Qing Dynasty and served as a secretary in the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. In the early years of the Republic of China, he served as the superintendent of customs in Wenzhou, Zhenjiang, and Huai'an. He is currently an advisor to the Shanghai Cultural Relics Management Committee and recently came to Beijing for a visit. Upon receiving this information, we decided to visit him.

　　When I visited Mr. Mao Guangsheng, he was reading a newspaper. Seeing someone arrive, he immediately took off his reading glasses to greet me. The conversation began with the topic of the rectification campaign. The old gentleman pointed to a large stack of newspapers on the tea table and said with emotion, "These past few days, I've been reading the speeches of some people in the newspapers, and the more I read, the more I feel something is wrong. It's gotten to the point where an old man like me, over eighty years old, has to speak up."

　　"Some people say that the current world is 'the Party's world,' that the Communist Party is not good, and that they want to kill the Communist Party," the old gentleman said. "People have to speak from the heart. Honestly, where can you find such a good Party and government!" He said that he had dreamed of a new, egalitarian society since he was young, and after waiting his whole life, he was finally lucky enough to see it. The Communist Party had realized his ideals. Not only had they realized them, but they had far surpassed them.

　　He talked about the past.

　　During the Guangxu era, he was a young man in his twenties. He read Rousseau's books. He spoke of reform and demanded innovation. He supported Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, he took a special economics examination. In his exam paper, he promoted Rousseau's theories. Zhang Zhidong, who was grading the papers, was furious upon seeing this and immediately removed his paper, preventing the emperor from seeing it. He wrote seven characters on it: "Citing Rousseau, how could this be!" Afterwards, Zhang Zhidong said to others, "Mao Heting (Mr. Mao's pseudonym) is too unclear about the history of the Lu family. The Lu family has never produced a good person! Lu Junyi (a hero of the Water Margin) was a male thief, and Lu Mouchou (a famous courtesan of the Six Dynasties) was a female prostitute. The Lu family is so bad, why does he want to quote Rousseau!" Mr. Mao said here, "Now I'm telling you this as a joke! But back then, the dignified imperial examiner thought like that!"

　　He said that later he went to work in the Ministry of Justice (equivalent to the current Ministry of Justice). He was young and couldn't stand many things. For example, he had objections to the unequal treatment of prisoners. Prisoners without money were crammed into a small, dirty, and smelly room. Prisoners who spent money lived in three rooms by themselves, with a living room, and could freely smoke opium. For another example, if a master and a maid committed adultery and were reported, the man would only be fined a small amount quietly. But the woman would be subjected to slow slicing (a form of execution). Rich and poor prisoners were treated differently when entering and leaving prison. The poor had to crawl under the iron chains, while those who paid the jailers had the chains removed and could swagger in. How could there be such strange things in the world? He couldn't stand it and went to talk to his superiors. He suggested that in cases like adultery between a master and a maid, the man should at least be dismissed from his post. His superiors laughed and said, "You are really a scholar. If it were as you said, all the officials in the world would be dismissed."

　　"At that time, everything had to be bought with money. No one cared if you had real talent or knowledge. As long as you spent money, you could become an official." He said that once the Grand Secretary Natong took a liking to him and wanted to send him to a local post as a Daotai (circuit intendant). The news spread, and many people knew about it. One day, Natong sent his close subordinate to invite him to dinner. There was no one else at the table. At first, the two talked very congenially, but later, the conversation became awkward, and at eleven o'clock, they broke up unhappily. He felt that Natong's subordinate seemed to have secret words to say to him, but he couldn't say them. Afterwards, Natong was very cold to him, and the matter of going out to a local post was no longer mentioned. He was puzzled and asked a close friend. The friend laughed when he heard this, "You are really a fool! Natong asked someone to invite you to dinner alone, that was to ask you for money, to ask you to show him filial respect. If you gave him a check, or promised to show him a certain amount of silver every year when you took office, then you would be sure to get the job!" He suddenly understood after hearing this. Mr. Mao said, "Officials like that, once they took office, would only think about how to get their investment back, how could they have the heart to serve the people!"

　　He also talked about the world in the early years of the Republic of China.

　　"The Qing Dynasty was corrupt and eventually fell. But the Republic was not much stronger! Yuan Shikai's administration was a complete mess!" He said that Yuan Shikai, when he was president, still paid lip service to democracy and set up a parliament. At that time, there was this party and that faction in the parliament, and the deputies worked for whoever gave them more money. When electing the president, there were not enough people (two-thirds of the deputies had to vote for it to count), so they had no choice but to have the police block the door, and forcibly "elected" this president.

　　The Beiyang warlords became even more outrageous later. You fought, I robbed, in name they also hung up the banner of democracy, and also engaged in elections. But what were they electing! They were buying votes with money. Who didn't know that Cao Kun bribed voters! A man named Shao Cigong even published the silver notes that Cao Kun had bribed him with in the newspaper.

　　Mr. Mao said that when Feng Guozhang was acting president, it was even worse. This president was obsessed with money. When his subordinates reported important national affairs, he often dozed off, but as soon as someone mentioned that hoarding something could make money, he would perk up. He sold everything, even the fish in the Three Seas (Beihai, Zhong, and Nanhai), and the people gave him the nickname "President who sells fish."

　　At that time, everything had to be bought with money. It cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy a seat in parliament. Of course, the deputy had to recover his investment after spending money to become a deputy. Deputies were busy all day writing letters to local officials in their hometowns, arranging for their sons to get such and such a job, and for their relatives to get such and such a lucrative position! If the local officials didn't listen, they would submit a proposal to the parliament to let the local officials taste the consequences of disobeying orders!

　　He told such a thing: During the Beiyang warlord period, Liang Qichao was the Minister of Finance. Liang was his good friend, but he was very serious about asking for money. One year, when he was the superintendent of customs in Wenzhou, Liang asked him for money to be used as party expenses. He ignored him, but within a few days, his job was gone.

　　"Those officials were all obsessed with money, and they didn't care about the people at all! Foreigners, seeing this piece of fat, of course came to eat it." Mr. Mao said, "The number of treasonous treaties signed at that time was countless. Foreign warships would move into the inland rivers at every turn. Cao Rulin received two million yuan from the Japanese and casually sold the right to use the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan!"

　　He said that when it came to Chiang Kai-shek, there were even more tricks! He waved the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, but what he did was a dark and sunless thing! What Chiang did was a real "Party world," and people who were not of the Kuomintang lineage were not popular. Chiang also engaged in "constitutionalism," but who didn't know how his presidency came about, who didn't know how many gold bars he spent to buy the vice presidency for Sun Ke!

　　"How could the people live with such politics!" He said that his large family, with many young and middle-aged people, lost their jobs near liberation. On the day of liberation, the whole family only had thirteen yuan, and they almost starved to death!

　　The old gentleman was old, and he was out of breath after speaking for a long time. I advised him to rest for a while, but he insisted on continuing to speak. He said that the People's Government had done so many good things after liberation that he had to talk about them.

　　He said that after liberation, almost everyone had food to eat and clothes to wear. Like his family, several sons had jobs. The grandchildren were doing well. He said, "The Communist Party has governed the country so well, it should be said that this is a miracle in history!"

　　"Some people say that there is no democracy now! I don't know what kind of democracy those people want!" He said that the current people's congresses at all levels are organs for the people to exercise their power, and the responsible cadres of the governments at all levels are elected by the people's congresses. The responsible cadres of the government implement the resolutions of the People's Congress. Unlike in the past, when a new official took office, he would announce a whole set of new ideas as soon as he got off the car, and those beautiful words would never be fulfilled in his lifetime. Now, the government does what the people tell it to do!

　　The old gentleman was tired and could not say any more. His son read us a passage from another article recently written by the old gentleman. It said:

　　"The Party's leading position and the people's democratic dictatorship are clearly stipulated in the Constitution and cannot be denied. Socialism is the most ideal and perfect system! It must not be opposed or undermined! The Party welcomes non-Party members to participate in this rectification campaign. This is an enlightened measure to broaden avenues for expression, solicit opinions widely, appeal to public opinion, and be selfless. Since the Communist Party is open and honest, we should also treat them with sincerity, fulfill the responsibility of a candid friend, and not harbor personal grievances or indulge in emotionalism, disregarding the overall situation."

　　As we were leaving, Mr. Mao repeated, "I am already eighty-five years old! I have no desire to engage in political activities anymore. I don't want to be an official, nor do I want to make money. So everyone can believe me, when I say the Communist Party is good, I am speaking from the heart, and I am being fair."

　　八五老人一席话
　　——访冒广生老先生
　　本报记者  傅冬
    6月6日的人民日报上登了一篇冒广生写的文章，题目是：“对目前整风的一点意见”。文章登出去以后，有些读者来信说，很想知道这位八十五岁老人的具体情况。
    我们从旁人那里打听到：冒广生江苏如皋人。他是清朝的举人，他作过刑部和农商部的郎中。民国初年，他任温州、镇江、淮安的海关监督。现在是上海文管会的顾问。最近来北京参观。得到这个消息，我们决定去看他。
    我访问冒广生先生的时候，他正在看报。看见人来，马上脱下老花镜来招呼。谈话从整风问题开始。老先生指着茶几上一大叠报纸感慨地说：“这几天在报上看到有些人的讲话，越看越不对劲，弄得我这八十多岁的老头子也不得不说说话了。”
    “有些人说现在的天下是‘党天下’，说共产党不好，要杀共产党。”老先生说：“人说话总得凭良心。说真的，到那儿找这么好的党和政府呵！”他说，他从小就梦想一个人人平等的新社会，等了一辈子，总算运气，给他等着了。共产党把他的理想实现了。不但实现了，而且远远地超过了。
    他谈起了过去。
    光绪年间，那时他还是个二十几岁的青年人。他读了卢梭的书。他讲变法，要求革新。他拥护康有为、梁启超。光绪二十九年，他考经济特科。他在考卷上宣传卢梭的学说。看卷子的张之洞一看，大怒，马上就把他的考卷撤了，不叫皇帝看。并在上面写了七个字：“论称引卢梭，奈何！”事后张之洞对人说：“冒鹤亭（冒老先生的号）对卢家的历史太不清楚了。卢家没出过好人！卢俊义（水浒上的英雄好汉）是男盗，卢莫愁（六朝名妓）是个女娼。卢家这么糟，他为什么要引卢梭的话！”冒老先生讲到这里，说：“现在我是当笑话给你们讲！可是当时堂堂的皇上考官就是这样！”
    他说，以后他到刑部作事（相当现今的司法部）。他年纪不大，好多事看不惯。比方说，对犯人待遇不一样，他就有意见。没钱的犯人一大群挤在一个又脏又臭的小屋里。花了银子的犯人，一个人住三间房，有客厅，还可以自由自在地抽大烟。再比如男主人和女仆通奸，如被人告发，男的只悄悄罚几个钱就算了。而女的要受剐刑。有钱的和没钱的犯人出门进门也都不一样，穷的要爬着从铁链子底下钻过去，给狱吏花了钱，铁链就卸了，可以大摇大摆地走进去。世上那有这样的怪事，他看不顺眼，就去找上司谈，他提出像男主人和女仆通奸的事，男的至少应该革职。上司一听哈哈大笑说：“你真是个书生，要是像你说的那样，那天下的官统统要被裁光了。”
    “那时什么都要用钱买。谁也不看你有没真才实学。只要花钱就可以作官。”他说，有一次大学士那桐看上他了，要放他到地方上当道台。消息传出来了，好多人都知道了。有一天，那桐派自己的亲近下属把他找去吃饭，桌上没有别的人。开始两人谈的很投机，可是谈到后来，越谈越不对劲，到十一点，实在谈不下去了，就不欢而散。他觉得那桐的下属好像有机密话要给他说，可又说不出口。以后再见面，那桐对他很冷淡，外出的事不再提了。他莫名其妙，就问一位知心的朋友。那人一听笑了：“你真是个傻瓜！那桐叫人找你一个人吃饭，那就是要你出银子，叫你孝敬他。假如你打个银票，或者许个愿，到任上每年孝敬他老人家多少银子，那差事就保险拿到手了！”他听了以后才恍然大悟。冒老先生说：“这样的官到了任上，整天想的就是怎样把本钱捞回来，那有心事给老百姓办事！”
    他又谈到民国初年的天下。
    “满清腐败，后来倒了。可是民国也强不了多少！袁世凯当政是一塌糊涂！”他说，袁世凯当总统，面子上还讲讲民主，搞个什么议会。那时候，议会里这样一个党，那样一个派，议员是谁出的钱多就给谁办事。选总统的时候，人数凑不够（要三分之二的议员投票才算数），没办法，只好叫警察拦在门口，勉强“选出”了这个大总统。
    北洋军阀闹到后来更不像话了。你争，我夺，名义上也挂个民主的牌子，也搞什么选举。可那选的是什么呀！那是花钱买的选票。曹锟贿选谁不知道！有一个名叫邵次公的，就曾把曹锟贿赂给他的银票在报上公布过。
    冒老先生说，冯国璋当代理总统的时候更糟糕。这位总统叫钱迷住心了。下面的人给他汇报国家大事，他常打瞌睡，只要提上一句囤积什么东西可赚钱，他的精神就来了。他什么都卖，连三海（北海，中、南海）的鱼他都卖，老百姓给他起了个外号叫“卖鱼总统”。
    那时候样样都用钱买。一个议员要花几万块钱才能买到手。花了钱当了议员当然要收回本来。议员整天忙着给本乡本土的地方官写信，派自己儿子这样一个差事，派自己亲戚那样一个肥缺！要是地方官不理，那就在议会上提个议案，叫地方官尝尝不听命令的滋味！
    他讲了这样一件事：北洋军阀时候，梁启超任财政部长。梁是他的好朋友，在要钱这一点上可不含糊。有一年他在温州海关作监督，梁向他要钱说作党费。他没有理，那知没有几天，他的差事就掉了。
    “那些当官的都叫钱迷住心了，还管什么人民不人民！外国人看见这块肥肉当然要来吃了。”冒老先生说，“那时候订的卖国条约数也数不清。外国人的兵船动不动就开到内河。曹汝霖收了日本人二百万元，就随随便便把中东铁路的使用权卖给了日本！”
    他说，到蒋介石手里，花样更多！他打着青天白日旗，干的是暗无天日的事！蒋搞的才是名副其实的“党天下”，非统字号人不吃香。蒋也搞“宪政”，但谁不知道他的总统是怎样来的，谁不知道他给孙科买副总统花了好多金条！
    “这样的政治，老百姓怎样过活！”他说，他一大家子人，不少青壮年，快解放时，差事都没了。解放那一天，全家只有十三块钱，差点没饿死！
    老先生年纪大了，说话久了就气喘。我劝他休息一下，可他坚持要说，他说，解放后人民政府办的好事太多了，不能不说说。
    他说，解放后，几乎人人有饭吃有衣穿。像他家，几个儿子都有工作了。孙子们都干的挺不错。他说：“共产党把国家治得这样好，应该说，这是历史上的奇迹！”
      “有人说，现在不民主！不知道那些人要什么样的民主！”他说，现在的各级人民代表大会，就是人民行使政权的机关，各级政府的负责干部都是由人民代表大会选举的。政府的负责干部执行的是人代会的决议。不像过去新官上任，一下车就发表一大套新主张，而那些漂亮话一辈子也不兑现。现在是老百姓叫干什么，政府就干什么！
    老先生累了，不能再多说了，他的儿子给我们念了一段老先生近日新写的另一篇文章。那上面说：
  “党的领导地位和人民民主专政是宪法上明文规定的，不允许否定。社会主义是最理想、最完善的制度！不允许反对、破坏！党这次整风欢迎党外人士参加。这是广开言路，博采众议，诉诸公论，大公无私的英明措施。共产党既开诚布公，我们也应以至诚相见，尽到诤友的责任，而不应挟私嫌逞意气，置大局于不顾。”
      临走的时候，冒老先生又重复说了一句：“我已经八十五岁了！早没有心思搞政治活动了，我现在既不想作官，也不想弄钱。所以大伙可以相信我，我说共产党好，我说的是真心话，也是公道话。”
