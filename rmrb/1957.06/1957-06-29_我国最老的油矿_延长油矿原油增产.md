China's Oldest Oilfield Increases Crude Oil Production

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th - Yanchang Oilfield, China's oldest oilfield located in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi, exceeded its production plan for the first half of the year in the latter half of this month. This oilfield, known for organizing production with simple and crude methods, continued to drill a number of new oil wells in the hilly areas of the Yanchang and Yongping oil production zones in the first half of this year. As a result, the crude oil extracted by the entire oilfield in the first half of the year exceeded the plan by 12%.

In the simple refinery, refinery workers have initially implemented the "scientific operation method" and added a layer of "bubble tray tower" and "condenser" to the fractionation tower. Therefore, the gasoline, kerosene, and heavy diesel oil refined by the entire oilfield in the first half of the year exceeded the plan by more than 20% respectively.

　　我国最老的油矿
    延长油矿原油增产
    据新华社西安28日电　在陕北老根据地的我国最老油矿——延长油矿，本月下旬超额完成了上半年生产计划。这个素来以因陋就简地组织生产著称的油矿，今年上半年继续在延长和永坪两个采油区的丘陵地带打了一批新油井，因而全矿上半年采出的原油，比计划超额12％。
    炼油工人们在简陋的炼油厂里，初步推行了“科学运行法”，又在分馏塔上加装了一层“泡盘塔”和“冷凝器”，因此，使全矿在上半年炼制的汽油、煤油和重柴油，比计划分别超额20％多。
