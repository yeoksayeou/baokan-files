I Also Want to "Speak Out"

To the Editor:

After reading the speech of Mr. Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at Renmin University, I feel that the meaning of his speech is: the Communist Party today in China has become detached from the 600 million people, is no longer needed by the 600 million people, and therefore the Communist Party has reached the time to step aside and let others more capable take over, and if it doesn't, the people will take up knives and guns, and pick up shoulder poles to drive out and kill the Communist Party.

Is Mr. Ge's meaning correct? Is it a well-intentioned help for the Communist Party's rectification campaign? In my opinion, it is neither a concrete analysis of the contradictions nor a well-intentioned and timely warning, so I disagree with his point of view.

First of all, has the Communist Party mismanaged China? Has the living standard of the people actually improved? Or has it declined?

I think: Anyone who pays attention to the real lives of the broadest masses of Chinese people will not come to Mr. Ge's conclusion. Everyone has seen that, after liberation, the lives and political status of workers and peasants have greatly improved. Although the peasants suffered a world-rare flood, there was no human tragedy of the kind common in the old society and under the capitalist system. The broadest masses of Chinese workers and peasants, who used to be scolded as "coal blacks," "coolies," and "muddy peasants," are now the masters of the new society, isn't that obvious? Can it be said that the improvement in living standards is only for "Party members and cadres who ride small cars and wear serge uniforms?" I think Mr. Ge should calmly think about the fact that in a poor and huge country like China, the Party cannot predict everything and be free of mistakes in leading complex economic work. The question is what attitude should be taken towards the mistakes and shortcomings that arise in one's own work. Now the Party is humbly absorbing the opinions of non-Party members and actively improving its work. Can it be said that such a party leadership is a mess? What period in history has seen such a political party?

Secondly, Mr. Ge said that the masses "respect ghosts and gods but keep them at a distance," and that Party members are "plainclothes police," etc. I think if Mr. Ge had truly observed life, he would not say this. The historical facts of the past few years and today's rectification movement clearly tell us that the Communist Party and the people are as close as fish and water, and that the Party and the people share the same ideal, namely, to build a beautiful socialist society. The vast majority of Communist Party members are the most outstanding people who have grown up from the masses. Although individuals or a section of the members have problems with their ideology and style of work, or even make mistakes that infringe on the interests of the people, they are not tolerated by the Party, and the Party will give these people serious criticism and punishment. At present, the broad masses of non-Party members are actively participating in the rectification movement and are kindly offering criticisms and suggestions to the Communist Party to help the Party rectify its style, which shows that the masses trust the Party, care about the Party, and are willing to help the Party correct its shortcomings in order to better lead everyone in building socialism.

The Communist Party does have shortcomings such as sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucracy, but it not only does not shy away from its own mistakes, but also asks the people to criticize its mistakes and shortcomings, and is determined to correct these shortcomings. Then, what reason do the masses have to "overthrow" such a political party?

As for saying that "if the Communist Party is gone, China will not be gone," I think this sentence is ridiculous. First, from a historical point of view, there would be no New China without the Communist Party. What is particularly worth mentioning here is that: in the years of national crisis, if there had been no Chinese Communist Party, the possibility of China's demise would indeed have existed. Before 1931, there was no Communist Party in the Northeast, and the Northeast perished under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. The people of the Northeast personally experienced fourteen years of life as slaves in a conquered nation. Second, without the leadership of the Communist Party, socialism cannot be built. Not to mention socialism, but whether our traditional independent national status exists, and whether it will be reduced to a colony of the United States by the likes of Chiang Kai-shek, is indeed a cause for concern! Mr. Ge also said that "if the Communist Party is gone, China will not be gone." Of course, one day the Communist Party will announce that it has completed its historical mission and will disappear, but at that time it will already be the communist society of world harmony, and the concept of the state will gradually become a historical thing.

In short, I think Mr. Ge Peiqi's speech neither reflects the reality of today's China nor proposes correct methods. His speech lacks positive significance for the rectification movement and national construction.

### 我也要“鸣”一“鸣”

专栏：

    我也要“鸣”一“鸣”编辑同志：
    我读了人民大学讲师葛佩琦先生的发言后，觉得他发言的意思是：共产党今天在中国已经脱离了六亿人民，不为六亿人民所需要了，因而共产党已经到了退让另贤的时候了，并且不如此人民就要动起刀枪、拿起扁担来赶杀共产党的时候了。
    葛先生这一番意思是不是正确？是不是善意地帮助共产党整风呢？照我看来，它既不是对矛盾的具体剖析，亦非善意和适时的警钟，因此我不同意他的观点。
    首先，共产党是不是把中国领导糟了？人民的生活水平究竟是提高了？还是降低了？
    我想：凡是留心最广大中国人民真实生活的人都不会得出葛先生这样的结论。大家都看到，解放后，工人农民的生活和政治地位是大大提高了，农民虽然遭到了世界罕见的大水灾，也没有发生在旧社会和资本主义制度下常见的那种人间惨剧；过去被人们骂作“煤黑子”、“苦力”和“泥巴佬”的中国最广大工农群众现在成为新社会的主人公，不是很明显吗？能够说生活水平之提高只是“坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部”吗？我认为，葛先生应该平心静气地想一下，像中国这样一个贫穷而巨大的国家，党在领导复杂的经济工作中是不可能预计一切而毫不出差错的。问题是对于自己工作中产生的错误和缺点应采取什么态度。现在党虚心地吸收党外人士的意见，积极改进工作，能说这样的政党领导是糟吗？历史上什么时期有过这样一个政党呢？
    其次，葛先生说，群众对党是“敬鬼神而远之”，党员是“便衣警察”等等，我认为如果葛先生真正观察过生活，就不会这样说。几年的历史事实和今天的整风运动清楚地告诉我们，共产党与人民是鱼水关系，党和人民的理想是一个，即建设美好的社会主义社会。共产党员绝大多数是人民群众中成长起来的最优秀的人物。虽然他们成员中的个别人或一部分人思想作风有毛病，甚至犯错误侵害了人民的利益，但是他们都是不被党容许的，党对这些人是要给以严肃的批评和处分的。目前广大的党外人士积极参加整风运动，并善意地向共产党提出批评和意见，帮助党整好风，说明群众信任党，关心党，愿意帮助党改正缺点，以便更好地领导大家建设社会主义。
    共产党内是有宗派主义、主观主义、官僚主义的缺点，但是她不仅不讳避自己的错误，而且要人民来批评自己的错误、缺点，并决心改正这些缺点，那末，群众有什么理由来“打倒”这样一个政党呢？
    至于说“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”，我觉得这句话是很可笑的。第一，从历史观点来看，没有共产党就没有新中国。这里值得特别提起的是：在民族危难的年代假若没有中国共产党，中国灭亡的可能性确实是存在的。1931年前，东北没有共产党，东北在蒋介石手下就亡了，东北人民是亲身过过十四年亡国奴生活的。第二，没有共产党的领导，社会主义就建不成。不要说社会主义，就是我们传统的独立国家地位是否存在，会不会被蒋介石之流沦为美国的殖民地，也确实使人们耽心呢！葛先生还说“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”当然将来总有一天共产党自己会宣布完成了历史任务而消灭，但那时已经是世界大同的共产主义社会，国家观念也逐渐地变成历史性的东西了。
    总之，我认为葛佩琦先生的发言既未反映当今中国的现实，亦未提出正确的办法，他的发言对于整风运动和国家建设都是缺乏积极意义的。
