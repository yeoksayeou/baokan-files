	Who Says State Representatives Can't Lead Production Well?

	Dong Shao Chen suggested withdrawing the state representatives from joint state-private enterprises and handing over the management rights to the private side, with work carried out under the leadership of the Party branch (some even want to remove the branch leadership). The workers of our joint state-private Chengdu Flour Mill firmly oppose this suggestion.

	Joint state-private enterprises are enterprises jointly operated by the state and capitalists; therefore, all parties should send representatives who represent their interests to jointly manage the enterprise well. This is only natural. Moreover, the state representative not only represents the state in managing the enterprise well, but also has the dual task of reforming the private personnel. We believe there is no reason to demand the withdrawal of state representatives from joint enterprises.

	As for Dong Shao Chen saying: "Currently, the relationship between the public and private sectors is not good, which is related to the fact that the state representatives see themselves as reformers, and the private sector generally has power without authority"; and saying: "... if the power is handed over to the private sector, the 'wealth' of the private sector can be unearthed...". We believe: the private sector having authority without power may exist in some enterprises; however, withdrawing the state representatives and handing over the management rights to the private sector is not a fundamental solution to the problem. Regarding excavating the "wealth" of private personnel, we believe that it can also be excavated without the state representatives being transferred away; because others can help themselves dig, and more importantly, they dig automatically. After the state representatives are transferred away, the "wealth" may turn into "five poisons".

	Before the joint venture, the capitalists of our factory often used petty favors to corrupt workers, talked about hometown relationships, and used methods such as inviting people to dinner, giving money, and giving things to win over some employees, blurring their class consciousness, and "fishing in troubled waters," engaging in private gain and capital withdrawal, committing all kinds of "five poisons." After the joint venture, under the leadership of the state representatives, the enterprise's appearance has undergone great changes, and the workers' enthusiasm for production has significantly increased. Before the joint venture, the enterprise had long-term losses; in the first quarter after the joint venture, not only were the annual losses made up, but there was also a considerable surplus; currently, the unit output has increased by 46.73% compared to before the joint venture, and the flour yield per hundred catties of wheat has increased by more than six catties compared to before the joint venture, and the workers' political and ideological awareness is also constantly improving. The above facts prove that the statement that "state representatives only have political capital and no technical experience, and cannot manage production well" is completely unfounded.

### 谁说公方代表领导不好生产？

    谁说公方代表领导不好生产？
    董少臣建议把公私合营企业的公方代表撤出去，把企业管理权交给私方，在党支部的领导下进行工作，（有人甚至连支部的领导也不要。）我们公私合营成都面粉厂的职工坚决反对这个建议。
    公私合营企业是国家和资本家共同经营的企业；那末，各方面就应当派出代表它们利益的代理人来共同管理好这个企业。这是理所当然的。再说公方代表不但代表国家管理好这个企业，而且还有改造私方人员的双重任务。我们认为就没有任何理由要求撤出合营企业里的公方代表了。
    至于董少臣说：“目前公私共事关系搞不好，这与公方代表以改造者自居，私方普遍有职无权有关”；又说：“……如果把职权交给私方，把私方这笔‘财富’挖出来……”。我们认为：私方有职无权在一部分企业中可能有之；但撤走公方，将企业管理权交给私方，并不是解决问题的根本办法。关于挖掘私方人员的“财富”，我们认为公方不调走也可挖；因为，别人可帮助自己挖，而更重要的还是自动挖。公方调走后就可能把“财富”变成“五毒”。
    我们厂在合营以前，资本家常以小恩小惠腐蚀工人，讲同乡关系，用请吃饭、送钱、送东西等手段拉拢一部分职工，模糊他们的阶级意识，自己从中“混水摸鱼”，营私抽资，“五毒”俱犯。合营后，在公方代表的领导下，企业面貌有了很大改变，职工的生产积极性显著提高。合营前企业长期亏损，合营后第一个季度，非但把全年亏损弥补起来，而且还有相当盈余；目前单位产量已较合营前提高46.73％，出粉率每百斤小麦较合营前提高出粉六斤以上，职工政治思想觉悟也不断提高。上述事实证明“公方代表光有政治资本没有技术经验，搞不好生产”的说法是完全没有根据的。
