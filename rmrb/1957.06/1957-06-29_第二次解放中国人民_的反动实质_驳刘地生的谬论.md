The Reactionary Essence of "Second Liberation of the Chinese People"
-- Refuting Liu Disheng's Fallacy

    Liu Disheng's article published in the People's Daily on June 22 stated that the fundamental way to eliminate the "three evils" is to eliminate the conditions that produce the three evils, and these conditions are "only allowing obedience to orders, without respecting human rights, and not advocating independent thinking." This means that our Party's policy is a "policy of fooling the people," the so-called "the people can be made to follow, but not made to understand." Here we can see that the essence of Liu Disheng's thought is to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and overthrow the fruits of victory already gained by our people.

    All our Party's policies and work are carried out through the mass line, and in the course of implementation, we always painstakingly persuade and educate the masses, oppose coercion and commandism, so that the masses understand the essence of the policy and voluntarily accept it; and we have carried out a broad literacy campaign so that workers and peasants can read newspapers and write letters, which was impossible in the old society. Can this be said to be making the people follow but not understand? The Constitution stipulates the protection of human rights, and we have done so. As for independent thinking, the Party has long advocated it, especially in the past six months, with the proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and the promotion of independent thinking among intellectuals and young students is ironclad proof. Liu Disheng completely denies these living facts and is single-mindedly trying to slander the leadership of the Communist Party.

    In the fourth paragraph of his article, Liu Disheng said, "The Communist Party is the leading party of the country. But it does not mean that the Communist Party is the country." and said that the Communist Party cannot represent the interests of 600 million people, etc. "In the future, the formulation of policies and guidelines should first proceed from the interests of 600 million people, and should not first proceed from the interests of the Party." The Party has never said that the Party is equal to the country, only that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, the representative of the interests of the working class, and also the representative of the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese working people. Precisely because of this, it has been supported and loved by the people, and has become the highest leader and organizer of the country. If it is said that the Communist Party cannot represent the interests of the people, then what were the land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, the land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" campaign, the socialist industrialization of the country, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce for? Who benefited from it? Even primary school students can answer these questions clearly. Perhaps the "people" referred to by Liu Disheng here are a small group of reactionary classes and figures who have been or are about to be overthrown by us? Of course, for such people, the Communist Party not only cannot represent their interests, but must also completely eliminate their interests. Doing so is precisely for the interests of the 600 million people of our country. Therefore, the Communist Party has taken root among the people, the people believe in the Communist Party as they believe in their own conscience, the people cherish the Communist Party as they cherish their own eyeballs, the relationship between the people and the Communist Party is as close as glue, and no force can break or sever it. Liu Disheng's attempt to undermine this relationship, abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, and openly propose the conspiracy that "the committee or branch of any political party has no power to issue orders or instructions to government organs or personnel outside the party, except for the organs or members of that party" is really a futile effort.

    What is even more infuriating is that Liu Disheng advocates that young people should have a pure professional viewpoint, not care about politics, not care about international and domestic affairs, schools should abolish political classes, and abolish the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations in primary and secondary schools. This is the real policy of ignorance. He attempts to win over our young students, wants to make the youth leave the ideological theory of Marxism-Leninism, so that we are blocked in a dark and suffocating world without sunlight, so as to accept the anti-socialist remarks of the right-wing elements, so that young students become echoes against socialism and against the leadership of the Communist Party, so as to launch a "Hungarian incident" at a certain time, overthrow the Communist Party and the people's democratic dictatorship, and achieve their ambitions. But they are fantasizing. The youth of our new China, under the education of the Party, have already learned some basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and will continue to learn. We deeply realize that without the guidance of the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, we will lose our souls politically. This rectification campaign is a very good test. Some students who usually do not pay attention to studying Marxism-Leninism become confused and do not know who is right and who is wrong after the right-wing elements have made their remarks. We also deeply realize that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no way out politically.

    Liu Disheng and other right-wing elements: turn back as soon as possible, and honestly follow the Communist Party. This is your only bright future.

### “第二次解放中国人民”的反动实质——驳刘地生的谬论

　　“第二次解放中国人民”的反动实质
　　——驳刘地生的谬论
    6月22日人民日报登载的刘地生的文章说消灭“三害”的根本办法就是消灭产生三害的条件，这些条件就是“仅允许听从命令，而不尊重人权，不倡导独立思考”。意思是说我们党的政策是“愚民政策”，即所谓“民可使由之，不可使知之”。这里我们可以看到刘地生的思想实质就是要取消共产党的领导，要推翻我们人民已得的胜利果实。
    我们党的各项政策和工作都是通过群众路线进行的，而且在贯彻执行时总是苦口婆心地对群众进行说服教育，反对强迫命令，让群众懂得政策的精神实质，自愿接受；并开展了广泛的扫除文盲运动，使工人农民能看报写信，这是旧社会根本办不到的。这能说成民可使由之不可使知之吗？宪法里规定保护人权，我们也这样作了。至于独立思考，党早就提倡，尤其是近半年来提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，和提倡知识分子和青年学生中的独立思考更是铁的证明。刘地生完全否认这些活生生的事实，而一心一意要污蔑共产党的领导。
    刘地生在其第四段文中说“共产党是国家的领导党。但不等于说共产党就是国家。”并说共产党不能代表六亿人民的利益等等。“今后制定政策方针应首先从六亿人口的利益出发，不应该首先从党的利益出发”。党从来没有说过党就等于国家，只说共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，工人阶级利益的代表者，也是中国广大劳动人民利益的代表者。正因为如此，它才受到人民的拥护和爱戴，才成为国家的最高领导者和组织者。如果说共产党代表不了人民的利益，那末，它在过去进行的土地革命、抗日战争、解放战争、土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动、“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”、国家社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，又是为了什么呢？是对谁有利呢？这一些问题连小学生都可以回答的一清二楚。也许刘地生在这里所指的“人民”是被我们打倒了或将要被打倒的一小撮反动阶级的集团和人物吧？当然，像这样的人，共产党不仅不能代表他们的利益，而且还要彻底消灭他们的利益。这样做正是为了我国六亿人民的利益。因此，共产党已在人民中扎了根，人民相信共产党像相信自己的良心一样，人民爱护共产党像爱护自己的眼珠一样，人民和共产党的关系如胶似漆，是任何力量都攻不破，割不断的。刘地生要想破坏这种关系，取消共产党的领导，公开提出“任何一个党派的委员会或支部，除开对那个党的机关或党员之外，没有权力对党外的政府机关或人员发布命令或指示”的阴谋实在是枉费心机。
    更令人愤怒的是刘地生提倡青年单纯的业务观点，不要关心政治，不要关心国际国内大事，学校中取消政治课，取消中小学的共青团和少先队组织。这才是真正的愚昧政策。企图拉拢我们青年学生，想使青年离开马列主义的思想理论，使我们蔽塞在阴暗窒息不透阳光的世界里，从而接受右派分子的反社会主义言论，使青年学生成为反对社会主义反对共产党领导的应声虫，以便在一定时机发动一次“匈牙利事件”，推翻共产党和人民民主专政，达到他们野心家的目的。但是他们是幻想。我们新中国的青年，在党的教育下，已经学习了马列主义的一些基本知识，还要继续学习。我们深深体会到没有马列主义思想武器的指导，就会在政治上失掉灵魂。这次整风就是很好的考验，一些平日不注意学习马列主义的同学，在右派分子发表了言论后就迷糊不清，不知谁是谁非。我们也深切体会到离开共产党的领导，在政治上就没有出路。
    刘地生及其它右派分子们：及早回头，老老实实跟着共产党走。这才是你们唯一的光明前途。
