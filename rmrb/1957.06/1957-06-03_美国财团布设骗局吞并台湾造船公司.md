Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 2nd: The inside story of the American consortium annexing the Taiwan Shipbuilding Company under the guise of "investment leasing" continues to be extensively exposed by Taiwan newspapers and people from all walks of life for the past two months.

According to comprehensive reports from Taiwan newspapers: The "Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding & Dockyards Corporation," established by the Americans after "taking over" the Taiwan Shipbuilding Company, has no actual investment. The $2.1 million in capital announced by this new American company is a fraud. Apart from some dilapidated equipment shipped from the United States, the rest are "dry shares" held under various pretexts. According to "Legislator" Guo Deng'ao, these "dry shares" that don't require any money account for 54% of the so-called "investment," and the American staff working at the new American company in Taiwan alone own 19% of the "dry shares." "Legislator" Jin Shaoxian revealed that when the Americans applied to the Kuomintang's "Ministry of Economic Affairs" for recognition of the newly established "Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding & Dockyards Corporation," they claimed that the new company's $100,000 in common stock and $1 million in preferred stock had been fully paid up, but there was no proof of any payment, and not a single cent has been remitted to Taiwan to this day.

Not only did the Americans not bring any money to invest in Taiwan, but the $9 million that this new American company "borrowed" from the Taiwan authorities was given a low interest rate of only 0.5%, while the interest rate for general industrial loans in Taiwan is 1.8%. The "rent" the Americans pay to the Taiwan authorities each year is only $120,000, equivalent to more than 4 million Taiwan dollars, while the Taiwan authorities lose hundreds of thousands of Taiwan dollars each year in interest alone.

The Americans have repeatedly boasted about how this new American company is carrying out shipbuilding "technical cooperation" with the Taiwan authorities, but according to a "Legislator," the so-called "technical cooperation" is simply sending many Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation employees to the Taiwan shipyard to supervise and provide old blueprints for shipbuilding. For this mere "cooperation," Taiwan has to give the American tycoons $1 million.

American businessmen also enjoy many privileges in Taiwan, such as the fact that machinery imported by this new American company is not subject to taxation, and the "daily necessities" imported by the American staff of this company are also not subject to taxation, etc.

    美国财团布设骗局吞并台湾造船公司
    新华社广州2日电　美国财团在“投资租赁”的幌子下吞并台湾造船公司的内幕，两个月来继续被台湾报纸和社会人士大量揭露出来。
    综合台湾报纸报道：美国人在“接收”台湾造船公司后成立的“英加尔斯台湾造船船坞公司”中，并没有什么实际投资。这家美商新公司所宣布的二百一十万美元资本是一个骗局。除了仅有由美国运来的部分破旧设备外，其余都是以各种名义拥有的“干股”。据“立法委员”郭登敖揭露，这种不必出钱的“干股”占了所谓“投资”的54％，仅来台湾美商新公司工作的美籍职员，就拥有“干股”19％。“立法委员”金绍贤揭露，美国人呈请国民党“经济部”对新成立的“英加尔斯台湾造船船坞公司”认许时，曾自称这家新公司的普通股十万美元和优先股一百万美元均已缴足，但没有任何缴足的证明文件，而且到现在没有一文钱汇到台湾。
    美国人不仅没有拿什么钱到台湾投资，而且美商这家新公司向台湾当局“借”的美金九百万元，也只给五厘的低利，而台湾一般工业放款的利率却是一分八厘。美国人每年给台湾当局的“租金”只有十二万美元，合台币四百多万元，而台湾当局在利息方面的损失每年就有数十万元台币。
    美国人一再吹嘘通过这家美商新公司如何跟台湾当局实行造船“技术合作”，但据一个“立法委员”揭露，所谓“技术合作”只是派许多美国英加尔斯造船公司的职员来台湾造船厂进行监督，供给造船的旧蓝图。仅是这么“合作”，台湾就得给美国大亨一百万美元。
    美国商人在台湾还享有许多特权，如这家美商新公司所用的机器进口不得征税，这家公司的美籍职员的“日用物资”进口也不得征税等等。
