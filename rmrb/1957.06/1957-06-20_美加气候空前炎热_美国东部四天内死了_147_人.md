　　US and Canada Experiencing Unprecedented Heat Wave
    147 Deaths in Eastern US in Four Days
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: Unseasonable and unprecedented heat, coupled with flooding in the eastern region, has led to the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven people in the four days from June 15th to 18th.
    Temperatures in the eastern United States have been above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days.
    This rare heat has caused power shortages in New York and Chicago, disrupting the operation of institutions and factories. It has also caused forest fires in some areas. At the same time, floods occurred in the eastern states of the United States after heavy rains. Hurricanes swept across the plains of the eastern United States, causing disasters.
    Temperatures in many parts of Canada have also recently been above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. According to some newspapers, it is rare for Canada to be so hot at this time, just like some parts of Western Europe.

　　美加气候空前炎热
    美国东部四天内死了147人
    据新华社19日讯　纽约消息：由于天时不正、空前炎热和东部地区的水灾，已经使一百四十七个人在6月15到18日这四天内死掉。
    美国东部地区最近几天的气温都在华氏九十度以上。
    这种少有的炎热使得纽约和芝加哥电力不足，破坏了机关和工厂的工作。并且在有些地区引起森林失火。同时，美国东部各州在暴雨之后发生了水灾。飓风掠过美国东部各州平原地带，造成了灾害。
    加拿大许多地方的气温最近也在华氏九十度以上。据一些报刊说，正如西欧一些地方一样，加拿大的气温目前就这样热是很少见的。
