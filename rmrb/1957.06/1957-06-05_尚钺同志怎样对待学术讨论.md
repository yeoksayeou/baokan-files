Comrade Shang Yue's Treatment of Academic Discussion
Deng Chunyang

For several years, the problem of undemocratic academic style has existed in the Chinese History Teaching and Research Section of Renmin University of China. Comrade Shang Yue, the director of the Teaching and Research Section, has consistently adopted crude means of suppressing different opinions on academic matters and has subjected teacher comrades who engage in academic debates with him to various forms of attacks, making it almost impossible for dissenting academic views to exist within the Teaching and Research Section. From the beginning of 1951 to the summer vacation of 1956, I worked in this Teaching and Research Section and had some personal experiences.

Divergence in Academic Views

Open disputes on academic views within the Teaching and Research Section began during the collective writing of the "Outline of Chinese History" textbook in 1952-1953 (published by People's Publishing House in 1954). At that time, Comrade Shang Yue's view on the periodization of Chinese history was: everything before the mid-Spring and Autumn period was the primitive commune period, with the period from the late Yin Dynasty to the mid-Spring and Autumn period being the late stage of the primitive commune, i.e., what Comrade Shang Yue called the "patriarchal slave system" period; the Spring and Autumn period to the Wei and Jin Dynasties was the slave society, and it had developed to the stage of large-scale slavery like Greece and Rome; the Wei and Jin Dynasties was the beginning of feudal society, and by the mid-Tang Dynasty, capitalist elements appeared; in the Ming Dynasty, Chinese society had developed to the stage of capitalist handicraft industry, about to break through the feudal system, so the Li Zicheng uprising had some characteristics of a bourgeois revolution. Based on this periodization, Comrade Shang Yue opposed the so-called long-term stagnation of Chinese feudal society. He believed that the reason why China had not entered capitalist society on the eve of the Opium War was due to the invasions and rule of ethnic groups such as the Mongols and Manchus, which caused a regression in social and economic development.

Some teacher comrades in the Teaching and Research Section, especially Comrades He Zhi, Zhang Wode, and I, held different opinions on Comrade Shang Yue's arguments. On the issue of ancient Chinese history periodization, we believed that the Yin Dynasty was a slave society, while the Han Dynasties were already a feudal society. We also believed that, regardless of when the upper and lower limits of Chinese slave society were, the development of slavery was insufficient. Comrade Shang Yue's periodization method was not only lacking in evidence but also often self-contradictory and could not convince us. However, since it was decided not to involve the nature of ancient society when writing the textbook, there was no major dispute at that time. One of the central points of our argument with Comrade Shang Yue was the issue of the budding of capitalism in China. We believed that although the development of commodity economy within Chinese feudal society had a weak capitalist budding in the Ming Dynasty, it still had not developed to the stage of handicraft industry by the eve of the Opium War. We disagreed with unilaterally emphasizing the growth of capitalist elements and exaggerating the level of development of commodity economy and capitalist budding by confusing non-commodity production with commodity production and simple commodity production with capitalist production in many places, while ignoring the fact that natural economy occupied a dominant position, and ignoring the long-term stagnation characteristics of Chinese feudal society. We disagreed with unilaterally emphasizing the positive role of commodity economy and capitalist budding in negating the feudal system, and attempting to derive industrial capitalism directly from commercial capital, while ignoring the service of commodity economy to the feudal system, the combination of commercial capital with feudal land relations, and the fact that capitalist budding itself still had a very strong feudal character at that time. We also disagreed with unilaterally and distortingly exaggerating the regression caused by the invasions and rule of ethnic groups such as the Mongols and Manchus, while ignoring the analysis from within Chinese society of the reasons why China had not entered capitalist society on the eve of the Opium War.

Comrade Shang Yue also excessively emphasized the "ethnic struggles" between the Han nationality and other ethnic groups in Chinese history, ignoring the class struggle essence of "ethnic struggles" and the class struggles within the Han nationality during these periods. In Comrade Shang Yue's writings, various minority nationalities were often described as "backward," "barbaric," "brutal," "full of plundering nature"..., almost all of them were slaughtering and oppressing the Han nationality, and almost all of them were destroying the economy and culture. Comrade Shang Yue often regarded the invasions and conquests of neighboring countries by Chinese feudal rulers in history as just and played a positive role without distinction. We firmly opposed these arguments, believing that these were manifestations of Han chauvinism and great-power chauvinism, and that propagating these arguments was harmful.

We also had major differences with Comrade Shang Yue regarding the evaluation of many historical events and historical figures. We also felt that it was inappropriate for Comrade Shang Yue to often negate some thinkers and their works, some writers and their works in our history without analysis.

Comrade Shang Yue's academic views have been largely reflected in the "Outline of Chinese History" collectively written by the Teaching and Research Section. Our main differences with him were also mentioned in my "Some Opinions on the 'Outline of Chinese History'" ("Teaching and Research", 1956, combined issues 8 and 9) and in the "Review of 'Outline of Chinese History'" ("Historical Research", 1957, issue 1) written by Zhang Wode, He Zhi and me. When writing the "Outline of Chinese History", the differences between the two sides were not very clear on some issues, but increasingly formed a systematic divergence. Comrade Shang Yue's views on the periodization of ancient Chinese history have changed slightly in recent years, that is, there are slight advances or delays in dividing periods, and the statement of capitalist budding has also been postponed in terms of time, but its basic arguments remain unchanged.

Several Unpleasant Public Debates

Comrade Shang Yue wanted to make his set of views on Chinese history public through writing a comprehensive history of China to form his own theory, and first wanted to run his views through the "Outline of Chinese History" textbook collectively written by the Teaching and Research Section. Originally, the writing of this textbook was for the needs of teaching in various departments (without the History Department) of Renmin University at that time; according to the students' situation, most comrades believed that the views recognized by the academic community or agreed by the majority of the academic community should be used to write. In fact, very few of the comrades who were writing at that time agreed with Comrade Shang Yue's basic views. However, considering that Comrade Shang Yue was the leader, everyone had to take care of his opinions as much as possible when writing. During the writing process, some comrades referred to Comrade Shang Yue's incomplete lecture notes when he lectured at the History and Geography Special Training Department of Renmin University in 1950-1951, that is, the "original manuscript" of the "Outline of Chinese History" which Comrade Shang Yue called "basically" "written" by him in the "Editor's Notes" of the "Outline of Chinese History". Comrade Shang Yue attempted to prove that this book was his personal "work" by this, but in fact, except for the "Editor's Notes", no section of the book was written by him. Someone had referred to his past lecture notes, but it was just like referring to general comprehensive history works, only referring to them. However, Comrade Shang Yue slightly altered the initial drafts written by everyone through the review work, and later through Comrade Zheng Changgan, who participated in the proofreading work of this book, partially rewrote individual key chapters of the late Tang Dynasty and Ming and Qing Dynasties, and suppressed different opinions by crude means, so that this book basically reflected his views.

During the discussion of the initial drafts of the parts after the Tang Dynasty of this book reviewed by Comrade Shang Yue, open disputes occurred. Comrade Shang Yue believed that his views were the only correct ones, and only allowed everyone to understand his views through discussion. If there were any different opinions, it would be "anti-Marxism-Leninism"; as for someone publicly arguing with him and always disagreeing with his opinions, then there would be even more problems.

The earliest public dispute occurred when discussing the part on the Yuan Dynasty written by me. According to Comrade Shang Yue's argument, the rule of the Yuan Dynasty caused the social and economic development to regress. I also tried to take care of his argument when writing, and emphasized the hindering effect of the Yuan Dynasty's rule on economic development, but still caused a dispute over the composition of export goods in the Yuan Dynasty's foreign trade. Comrade Shang Yue believed that because the handicraft industry production in the Yuan Dynasty declined due to severe damage, the main export goods were gold, silver, copper coins, iron goods, and slaves, and very few handicraft products. I believed that this was distorting the facts, and cited historical materials to prove that the main export goods were still porcelain, silk fabrics, iron products ("iron goods" mostly referred to iron products such as iron pots), and other handicraft products. Comrade Shang Yue still insisted on his own opinion, distorting the facts to accommodate the argument, and was very dissatisfied with me. Later, as a result of a compromise, the original manuscript was revised to the ambiguous description in the current "Outline of Chinese History" (see page 273 of the book).

Soon, another dispute occurred over the evaluation of Zhu Yuanzhang. Comrade Shang Yue emphasized "ethnic struggles." He believed that the peasant war in the late Yuan Dynasty was mainly a struggle against national oppression, so Zhu Yuanzhang's policy of uniting Han landlords and gentry intellectuals and his transformation towards establishing a Han landlord class dynasty were correct and necessary. He described Zhu Yuanzhang as very great, even saying that Zhu Yuanzhang tried his best to safeguard the interests of peasants and suppress the landlord class after becoming emperor. Naturally, I disagreed with these arguments. Therefore, when I wrote this part of the lecture notes, I had to focus on the narration of the facts themselves and avoid developing his very inappropriate arguments. He was very unhappy, not only thinking that my initial draft was "listing materials" and was "objectivism", but also questioning me "where is your stand?" because my evaluation of Zhu Yuanzhang was not as great as he thought. He overturned the original draft and asked Comrade Zheng Changgan to rewrite it.

At the Teaching and Research Section meeting discussing the two sections written by Comrade He Zhi on the Ming Dynasty, "Development of Handicraft Industry, Commodity Economy and Growth of Capitalist Elements" (this is the current title) and "Extreme Autocratic Feudal System and Social Crisis in the Late Ming Dynasty", as well as the section written by me on "Li Zicheng and the Peasant Uprising in the Late Ming Dynasty", Comrade Shang Yue showed an extremely crude attitude. As mentioned above, Comrade Shang Yue had his own views on the economic and political development of the Ming Dynasty, some of which were very peculiar. I raised different opinions on the draft he had reviewed and revised, and pointed out the errors in the materials he had added. This had already caused his dissatisfaction. When the meeting was held, Comrade He Zhi mentioned again that the two sections he had written had tried to take care of Comrade Shang Yue's views, but if he wrote his own articles, he could refute the views he had written himself. After Comrade Shang Yue heard our speeches, he was very unhappy and said in a sarcastic tone: "We also know that Comrade Chunyang has received bourgeois education for a long time and understands a lot about the bourgeois stuff, but you should know that the bourgeois stuff doesn't work in our Renmin University!" He sternly questioned me: "You wrote on your draft that the Ming army massacred the rebel army and extended to the innocent. Does it mean that the peasants who participated in the uprising were guilty? What is your stand?! What is the political background of your writing like this?!" These extraneous words were obviously not conducive to academic discussion. Comrade He Zhi suggested at the meeting: The issue of ideological style should be discussed at the life criticism meeting, and the discussion of the lecture notes is more important now. Comrade Shang Yue immediately became furious, slammed the table and asked He Zhi: "He Zhi! Is this Teaching and Research Section led by you or me?" After Comrade Shang Yue lost his temper, the meeting broke up unhappily. Afterwards, I apologized to him. Comrade Shang Yue also criticized himself for "showing attitude" was not good at another meeting, but refused to admit suppressing academic criticism. Since then, Comrade Shang Yue has stopped convening Teaching and Research Section meetings to discuss lecture notes.

Comrade Shang Yue soon showed a more severe attitude, which was when discussing the section "Development of Feudal Economy after the Mid-Tang Dynasty". Comrade Shang Yue made additions and supplements to the original draft of this section written by Comrade Sun Jiaxiang, running through his viewpoint of "the budding of capitalism in the Tang Dynasty". At that time, I was also in charge of the proofreading of the first draft. In order to be responsible for this book, I had to raise my opinions. Comrade Shang Yue forced me to organize and print the outline immediately after passing the argument at the three-person revision group meeting consisting of him, Comrade Zheng Changgan, and me. I advocated that all teachers and staff hold a meeting to discuss, but he firmly disagreed. In the end, Comrade Shang Yue still forced me to hold a discussion at the three-person group meeting. At the meeting, Comrade Zheng Changgan supported his viewpoint, and Comrade Shang Yue wanted to pass it on this basis. At this point, I had to step back, but declared that I reserved my own opinions. Unexpectedly, Comrade Shang Yue suddenly became furious, saying that my declaration of reserving opinions was "sabotaging"; and because I suggested holding a general meeting for further discussion, and said that comrades like He Zhi could have the opportunity to provide opinions, he even reprimanded me sharply: "You are trying to undermine our intra-Party relationship!" (Comrade He Zhi is a Party member) Because he openly used this to intimidate, I had to lodge a serious protest to him on the spot.

With the support of Comrade Yin Da (Comrade Shang Yue was still the vice director at that time), who also held the position of director of the Teaching and Research Section, a Teaching and Research Section meeting to discuss this section of the lecture notes was finally held. Comrade Shang Yue's viewpoint was unanimously opposed at the meeting. The meeting decided to hand it over to a comrade to revise the initial draft according to everyone's opinions. However, when it was published later, it still vaguely retained Comrade Shang Yue's viewpoint.

The above are several unpleasant public disputes that occurred in 1952-1953. If it was possible to hold meetings to argue about academic views between us and Comrade Shang Yue before the autumn of 1953, then after Comrade Yin Da was transferred away in the autumn of 1953, Comrade Shang Yue suppressed academic democracy without any scruples and did whatever he wanted, completely canceling academic freedom of discussion.

Academic Tyranny

In the winter of 1953, Comrade Sun Fangming raised some different opinions on several points in the lecture notes at a teaching meeting, and had a dispute with Comrade Zheng Changgan. Comrade Shang Yue got angry again when he heard the reflection. He mobilized some people to "criticize" Sun Fangming, suppressing these different opinions. It was after this incident that Comrade Shang Yue stipulated that teaching meetings only discuss teaching methods and stop discussing the viewpoint issues in the lecture notes, declaring that he was responsible for the viewpoint. From then on, academic freedom of discussion was declared terminated.

Comrade Shang Yue established a "one person is supreme" rule in the Teaching and Research Section. This rule was established with administrative power and organizational means. His views were announced by himself as the views of the Teaching and Research Section. He argued that the "Outline of Chinese History" was "discussed" and approved by everyone, and believed that anyone who violated the views of this book in teaching was "unorganized and undisciplined". In this case, if someone said that his views were just one person's views, it would be a taboo, and it would be considered undermining the "academic prestige" of the leadership.

In order to maintain this rule, Comrade Shang Yue not only crudely suppressed different opinions within the Teaching and Research Section, but also often attacked historians outside the school who had different academic opinions from him. Within the Teaching and Research Section, whether in private conversations, meetings, or even in the classroom, he openly insulted some historians who had different views from him.

Comrade Shang Yue was extremely disrespectful to many historians in our country who had not applied Marxism-Leninism to study history before liberation, believing that they "all had bourgeois viewpoints and had not been reformed". I once used the extremely reliable textual research results of a famous historian in writing a section of lecture notes. After Comrade Shang Yue asked who it was, regardless of whether the textual research was reliable or not, he said, "He is a bourgeois scholar, his things cannot be used!"

I and some comrades have repeatedly expressed our opinions, hoping that the Teaching and Research Section would open up academic democracy, advocate independent thinking, learn from the excellent tradition of many historians in our country who do their scholarship in a down-to-earth manner, and respect their past and present achievements that are worth affirming. But our opinions were often distorted as "propagating bourgeois viewpoints", "having problems with stand", "being divorced from politics", etc. In the Teaching and Research Section, Comrade Shang Yue considered me to be a "historical materials faction", and my academic views were "idealism", "objectivism", "cosmopolitanism"..., while Comrade He Zhi was "unstable in stand" and "surrendering to the bourgeoisie".

Comrade Shang Yue's academic style had a very bad influence in the Teaching and Research Section. Some young comrades were blinded by one person's theory and became arrogant and conceited academically. Comrade Shang Yue used this sentiment to organize many articles "criticizing" other people's academic viewpoints, but different opinions could not get the opportunity to be published.

I and some comrades worked in this suffocating atmosphere and were extremely depressed spiritually. Comrade Shang Yue believed that my "bourgeois ideology had not been reformed", my professional ability was very low, and I was not qualified to be a teacher, so I could only do material work or needed to be sent for further study. He personally revealed this meaning to me and opposed assigning me work after I was on sick leave. He believed that I had a "bad attitude towards labor" when writing the "Outline of Chinese History" and raising different opinions for debate. And he always said that I was "working passively".

Comrade Shang Yue also declared during this period that he wanted to "open up democracy". But then, when Comrade Zeng Xiankai wrote an article on "'Dream of the Red Chamber's' social background and its tendencies", he immediately treated Comrade Zeng Xiankai with a crude attitude again. Comrade Zeng Xiankai's estimate of the budding of capitalism in the Qing Dynasty in this paper was relatively low, and Comrade Shang Yue forced her to revise it according to Comrade Shang Yue's viewpoint. Although Comrade Zeng Xiankai still insisted on her own viewpoint, she suffered a lot of grievances. Comrade Zeng Xiankai's incident proved that Comrade Shang Yue insisted on his tyrannical rule, making me feel that it was impossible to strive for academic freedom of discussion in the Teaching and Research Section; in desperation, in early 1955, I wrote an article raising different opinions on Comrade Shang Yue's viewpoints reflected in the "Outline of Chinese History", hoping to make the discussion public to the society. However, this article was subjected to various obstacles in the process of writing and publishing. Initially, someone mobilized me not to write; after I finished writing, someone mobilized me to send it to the school journal "Teaching and Research", not to send it outside. This manuscript was sent to "Teaching and Research" at the end of March 1955, and was not published until September 1956, at which time I had been transferred to another school. When Comrade Shang Yue first saw my manuscript transferred by the editorial department of "Teaching and Research", he was very angry, declaring that my article was "idealism", "completely wrong", and not worth refuting by him.

I and Comrades He Zhi and Zhang Wode were subjected to various suppressions and attacks because of different academic opinions. Now we have all left this Teaching and Research Section. A few months ago, we had the opportunity to return to the Teaching and Research Section to participate in the meeting for the inspection work there, and learned that although "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has been put forward for a long time, the situation in this Teaching and Research Section has not changed much. We hope that Comrade Shang Yue will change his style in time in this rectification movement, normalize the academic atmosphere in the Teaching and Research Section, and make beneficial contributions to the cause of historical science under the Party's policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend".

    尚钺同志怎样对待学术讨论
    邓春阳
    几年以来，中国人民大学中国历史教研室一直存在着学术作风不民主的问题。教研室主任尚钺同志对学术上的不同意见一贯采取粗暴的压制手段，并对同他进行学术争论的教员同志加以各种打击，使得学术上的不同意见在教研室内几乎没有存在的余地。从1951年初到1956年暑假，我曾在这个教研室从事教学工作，便有过这样一些亲身的经历。
    学术观点上的分歧
    教研室内在学术观点上发生公开争论开始于1952—1953年集体编写“中国历史纲要”这部讲义（1954年由人民出版社出版）的时候。那时尚钺同志对中国历史分期问题的看法是：春秋中叶以前都是原始公社时期，其间从殷代后期到春秋中叶是原始公社末期，亦即尚钺同志所谓“家长奴役制”时期；春秋中叶到魏晋之际是奴隶社会，并且曾发展到像希腊、罗马那样的大奴隶制阶段；魏晋之际是封建社会的开始时期，到唐代中叶，便出现了资本主义的因素；在明代，中国社会已发展到资本主义工场手工业阶段，快要冲破封建制度，因此李自成起义便有了资产阶级革命的某些性质。根据这样的分期，尚钺同志反对所谓中国封建社会长期停滞的论点。他认为，中国在鸦片战争前夕还没有进入资本主义社会，是由于蒙古、满洲等族的入侵和统治造成社会经济发展的倒退。
    教研室一些教员同志特别是何志、张我德两同志和我对尚钺同志的论点持有不同意见。在中国古代史分期问题上，我们认为，殷代是奴隶社会，而两汉已是封建社会。我们也认为，无论中国奴隶社会的上限和下限在何时，但是奴隶制的发展是不充分的。尚钺同志的分期办法，不仅缺乏论据，而且常自相矛盾，不能使我们信服。不过关于这个问题由于编写讲义时确定不涉及古代社会性质，所以在当时还没有发生大的争论。我们同尚钺同志争论的中心之一是有关中国资本主义萌芽的问题。我们认为，中国封建社会内的商品经济的发展，到了明代虽然有了微弱的资本主义的萌芽，但是截至鸦片战争前夕，仍然没有发展到工场手工业阶段。我们不同意片面地强调资本主义因素的增长，并且在很多地方用混淆非商品生产同商品生产、简单商品生产同资本主义生产的方法来夸大商品经济和资本主义萌芽发展的水平，而忽略了自然经济占主要地位的事实，忽略了中国封建社会长期停滞的特点。我们不同意片面地强调商品经济和资本主义萌芽在否定封建制度方面的积极作用，并且企图从商业资本直接引出工业资本主义，而忽略了商品经济之为封建制度服务、商业资本同封建的土地关系相结合以及资本主义萌芽本身在当时仍具有极浓厚的封建性的事实。我们也不同意片面地并且歪曲事实地夸大蒙古、满洲等族的入侵和统治所造成的倒退，而忽略了从中国社会内部去分析鸦片战争前夕中国仍然没有进入资本主义社会的原因。
    尚钺同志又过分强调中国历史上汉族同其他各族之间的“种族斗争”，忽略了“种族斗争”的阶级斗争的实质和这些时期汉族内部的阶级斗争。历史上各少数民族在尚钺同志笔下，常常被描写为“落后”、“野蛮”、“残暴”、“富于掠夺性”……，对汉族差不多都是屠杀和压迫，对经济文化差不多都是破坏和摧残。历史上中国封建统治者对邻国的侵略和征服，尚钺同志也往往不加区别地把这些行动认为是正义的和起了积极作用的。我们坚决反对这些论点，认为这些是大汉族主义和大国主义的表现，宣传这些论点是有害的。
    对于许多历史事件和历史人物的评价，我们同尚钺同志之间也有重大的分歧。我们还感到尚钺同志对我国历史上一些思想家及其著作、一些文学家及其作品，常不加分析地予以否定，也是不恰当的。
    尚钺同志的学术观点已大体反映在教研室集体编写的“中国历史纲要”内。我们同他的主要分歧在我所写的“对‘中国历史纲要’的一些意见”（“教学与研究”，1956年第八、九期合刊）以及张我德、何志和我所写的“评‘中国历史纲要’”（“历史研究”，1957年第一期）两文中也提到了。在编写“中国历史纲要”的时候，双方的分歧在某些问题上还不十分明确，但愈来愈形成体系的分歧。尚钺同志近年来对中国古代史分期的看法略有改变，即在划分时期上稍有提前或推迟之处，对资本主义萌芽的提法也在时期上往后推迟一些，不过其基本论点仍无改变。
    几次不愉快的公开争论
    尚钺同志很早就想把自己对中国历史的一套看法通过写作一部中国通史的形式公诸于世，以成一家之言，而首先便是想在教研室集体编写的讲义“中国历史纲要”中贯穿他的观点。本来，编写这部讲义是为了当时人民大学本科各系（无历史系）教学的需要；按照学生情况，多数同志认为应该采用学术界公认或为学术界多数人所同意的观点来编写。事实上当时执笔编写的同志也是很少有人同意尚钺同志的基本观点的。但鉴于尚钺同志是领导人，大家在编写时只好尽可能照顾他的意见。在编写时有部分同志参考了尚钺同志1950—1951年度在人民大学史地专修科讲课时的不全的讲稿，即尚钺同志在“中国历史纲要”“编者的话”中所称“基本上”由他“编写”的“中国历史纲要”的“原稿”。尚钺同志企图以此证明这本书是他个人的“著作”，而事实上除了“编者的话”以外，全书没有一节是由他执笔编写的。有人参考过他过去的讲稿，但也不过是同一般的通史著作一样，只是参考一下而已。不过，尚钺同志却通过审阅工作，在大家所编的初稿上略加改窜，后来又通过参加此书校阅工作的郑昌淦同志将唐代后期和明清部分个别关键章节加以局部改写，并用粗暴手段压制了不同意见，使这本书基本上体现了他的观点。
    在讨论此书唐以后部分尚钺同志审阅过的初稿中，公开的争论发生了。尚钺同志以为他的观点是唯一正确的，只允许大家经过讨论来体会他的观点，如果有什么不同意见，便是“反马列主义”；至于公然有人同他争论并且始终不同意他的意见，那就更有问题了。
    最早的一次公开争论是在讨论我所写的元代部分时发生的。按照尚钺同志的论点，元代的统治使社会经济的发展倒退。我在编写时也尽量照顾了他的论点，相当强调了元代统治对经济发展所起的阻滞作用，但仍然为了元代对外贸易输出品的构成问题引起争论。尚钺同志认为，由于元代手工业生产因受到严重破坏而衰退，主要输出品是金、银、铜钱、铁货和奴隶，很少手工业品。我认为这是歪曲事实，举出史料证明主要输出品仍是瓷器、丝织品、铁制品（“铁货”中多系铁锅等铁制品）等手工业产品。尚钺同志依然坚持自己意见，歪曲事实迁就论点，并且对我很为不满。后来妥协结果，把原稿修改成现在“中国历史纲要”中那样含混的叙述（见该书第273页）。
    不久，为了对朱元璋的评价问题又发生争论。尚钺同志是强调“种族斗争”的。他认为元末农民战争主要是反对民族压迫的斗争，因之朱元璋所采取的团结汉族地主阶级士大夫分子的政策以及他的向建立汉族地主阶级王朝的政治路线的转变是正确的和必要的。他把朱元璋说得非常伟大，甚至说朱元璋在当了皇帝后还竭力维护农民利益、镇压地主阶级。我自然不同意这些论点。因此，我在编写这部分讲义时只好着重事实本身的叙述，避免去发挥他的很不妥当的论点。他很不高兴，不但认为我的初稿“罗列材料”，是“客观主义”，且因我对朱元璋的评价没有他看来那么伟大，质问我“立场何在？”推翻原稿，让郑昌淦同志重写。
    在讨论何志同志所写明代“工场手工业、商品经济的发展与资本主义因素的增长”（这是现在的标题）和“极端君主专制的封建制度与明末社会危机”两节以及我所写“李自成与明末农民大起义”一节的教研室会议上，尚钺同志更表现了极其粗暴的态度。如上文所述，尚钺同志对明代经济政治的发展都有自己的看法，其中有些看法是非常奇特的。我在他审阅修改过的稿上提出了不同的意见，并把他们添加的材料的错误之处也指出来。这已经引起他的不满。到开会时，何志同志又提到他所写的两节已尽量照顾了尚钺同志的看法，但是如果自己写文章的话还可反驳他自己写下的观点。尚钺同志听了我们的发言之后，很不高兴，并用讽刺的口吻说：“我们也知道春阳同志长期受资产阶级教育，对资产阶级那一套东西懂得很多，但是要知道资产阶级那一套在我们人民大学是吃不开的！”他又严厉质问我：“你稿上写着，明军屠杀起义军，延及无辜，难道参加起义的农民就是有罪吗？这是站在什么立场？！你这样写有什么政治背景？！”这些题外的话，显然不利于学术讨论，何志同志就在会上建议：关于思想作风问题，等到生活检讨会上来谈，现在讨论讲义要紧。尚钺同志立即大怒，拍桌子问何志：“何志！这个教研室究竟是你领导还是我领导？”在尚钺同志大发一顿脾气之后，会议不欢而散。事后，我去找他道了歉，尚钺同志也在另外的会上检讨了“耍态度”不好，但对压制学术批评的事却拒绝承认。从此，尚钺同志就不再召集教研室会议讨论讲义了。
    尚钺同志不久又更厉害地耍了一次态度，那是在讨论“中唐以后封建经济的发展”一节的时候。尚钺同志把孙家骧同志所写的这一节的原稿作了增补，贯穿了他的“唐代资本主义萌芽论”的观点。当时，我还担任初稿校阅工作。为了对此书负责，我不得不提出意见。尚钺同志硬逼着我在以他为首加上郑昌淦同志和我组成的三人修改小组会上通过论点之后即行整理付印。我主张全体教员开会讨论，他坚决不同意。最后，尚钺同志还是逼着我开三人小组会讨论了。会上郑昌淦同志支持他的论点，尚钺同志便要就此通过。至此，我不得不退步，但声明保留自己意见。不料尚钺同志顿时大怒，说我声明保留意见是“捣乱”；又因我建议开大会再讨论，并说像何志这些同志都可以有提供意见的机会，他竟厉声斥我：“你这样是想破坏我们党内关系！”（何志同志是党员）由于他公然以此来进行威吓，我不得不当场就对他提出了严重抗议。
    在兼任教研室主任职务的尹达同志（尚钺同志那时还是副主任）的支持之下，终于开了一次讨论这一节讲义的教研室会议。尚钺同志的观点在会上受到一致的反对。会议决定交一位同志按大家意见修改初稿。但是后来出版时仍然隐讳地保留着尚钺同志的观点。
    以上是发生在1952—1953年度的几次不愉快的公开争论。如果说，在1953年秋天以前，我们同尚钺同志之间还有可能开会来争论学术观点的话，那么从1953年秋天尹达同志被调走以后，尚钺同志便毫无顾忌地、为所欲为地压制学术民主，根本取消学术上的自由讨论了。
    学术上的专横统治
    1953年冬天，孙方明同志在一次教学会议上就讲义中的几点提出了一些不同意见，同郑昌淦同志发生争论。尚钺同志听到反映，又发了一顿脾气。他动员一些人对孙方明进行“批评”，把这些不同意见压制下去。就在这次事件后，尚钺同志规定教学会议只讨论教学方法，停止讨论讲义中的观点问题，声明观点由他负责。从此，学术上的自由讨论便宣告终止。
    尚钺同志在教研室建立了“一家独尊”的统治。这种统治是用行政权力和组织手段建立的。他的观点被他自己宣布为教研室的观点。他借口“中国历史纲要”是大家“讨论”通过的，认为谁要在教学中违反这本书的观点就是“无组织、无纪律”。在这种情况下，如果有人说他的观点不过是一家之言，便算是犯了忌讳，便算是破坏领导的“学术威信”。
    为了维护这种统治，尚钺同志不但粗暴地压制教研室内部的不同意见，对校外同他学术意见不同的史学家也常加攻击。在教研室内，无论在私人谈话中、会议上甚至在课堂上，他都公开辱骂过和他观点不同的一些史学家。
    尚钺同志对我国许多在解放前还没有应用马克思列宁主义研究历史的史学家更是极不尊重，认为他们“全部资产阶级观点，没有得到改造”。我曾经在编写一节讲义中利用了一位著名史学家的极为可靠的考订结果，尚钺同志问明是谁以后，不管考订是否可靠，即说，“他是资产阶级学者，他的东西不能用！”
    我和一些同志曾经多次提出意见，希望教研室开放学术民主，提倡独立思考，学习我国许多史学家做学问踏实的优良传统，尊重他们过去和现在所做出的值得肯定的成绩。但我们这些意见常被歪曲为“宣传资产阶级观点”、“立场有问题”、“脱离政治”，等等。我在教研室被尚钺同志认为是“史料派”，学术观点是“唯心主义”、“客观主义”、“世界主义”……，而何志同志则是“立场不稳”，“向资产阶级投降”。
    尚钺同志这种学术作风在教研室影响很坏。某些青年同志为一家之言所蔽，在学术上骄傲自大。尚钺同志利用这种情绪，组织了不少“批判”他人学术观点的文章，但不同意见却得不到发表机会。
    我和一些同志工作在这种窒息的空气中，精神上极为苦闷。尚钺同志认为我“资产阶级思想没有改造”，业务能力很低，不堪教员之任，只好作资料工作或须送去再学习。他亲自对我透露这个意思，并在我因病休养后，反对再给我分配工作。他认为我编写“中国历史纲要”提出不同意见来争论是“劳动态度不好”。并且一直说我“工作消极”。
    尚钺同志在此期间也曾经宣称过要“开放民主”。但接着在曾宪楷同志写“‘红楼梦’的社会背景和它的倾向性”一文的时候，他马上又用粗暴态度来对待曾宪楷同志。曾宪楷同志在这篇论文中对清代资本主义萌芽的估计比较低，尚钺同志强迫她按照尚钺同志的观点修改。虽然曾宪楷同志仍然坚持了自己的观点，但受了不少委屈。曾宪楷同志的事件证明尚钺同志坚持他的专横统治，使我感到在教研室内争取学术上的自由讨论已不可能；在无可奈何之余，1955年初我写了一篇对“中国历史纲要”中所反映的尚钺同志的观点提出不同意见的文章，希望把讨论公开到社会上去。但这篇文章在写作和发表过程中却受到各种阻挠。最初是有人动员我不要写；等到我写好后，又有人动员我送到校刊“教学与研究”，不要送到外面去。这篇稿子从1955年3月底送给“教学与研究”后，到1956年9月才发表出来，这时我已经调到他校工作了。尚钺同志最初看到“教学与研究”编辑部转去的我的稿件时，非常生气，宣称我这篇文章是“唯心主义”、“全盘错了”，不值他一驳。
    我和何志、张我德两同志因学术意见不同而备受各种压制和打击，现在我们都离开这个教研室了。几个月前，我们有机会回教研室去参加那里的检查工作的会议，了解到虽然“百家争鸣”提出已久，但是这个教研室的情况仍然没有什么改变。我们希望尚钺同志在这次整风运动中及时改变他的作风，使教研室的学术空气正常起来，并在党的“百家争鸣”方针下为历史科学事业作出有益的贡献。
