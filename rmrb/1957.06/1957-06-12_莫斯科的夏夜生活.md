Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: Our reporter Li Nan reports: The seasons in Moscow have turned to summer. The average temperature here in summer does not exceed twenty-seven degrees. Only after ten o'clock in the evening does the light blue sky completely turn black. However, Moscow's rich and varied summer nightlife begins several hours earlier.

    As summer nightlife arrives, working Moscow has finished another day of labor, the cars that have been rushing through the streets all day gradually decrease, and the number of pedestrians increases more than tenfold. The fountains in the squares are open, the motorboats on the Moscow River are waiting for tourists, elegant melodies are coming from the music performances in the parks, and at this time, the most popular football matches for Muscovites also begin in several stadiums.

    The Moscow parks in summer nights are the center of cultural arts and leisure life. Going to the park, you can see acrobatics and juggling from many countries, including ancient Chinese magic. Sometimes, people can enjoy international fashion shows. After nine o'clock, light music is played on the lawns, and people can freely dance or perform dances. In the deep shade, you can hear lectures on literature, art, or international politics, which are also fully seated.

    In summer, Moscow's theater troupes move to open-air theaters to perform, generally with light, cheerful, short, and concise programs. However, the indoor theaters are not idle either, with troupes from other cities and foreign troupes occupying the vacant theaters. This year, audiences will see London's ballet and the first Kabuki performance from Japan.

    This summer night, Moscow's youth are also busy preparing for the festival. Small-scale festival activities are taking place everywhere. On the wide granite embankment of the Moscow River, young amateur actors and folk singers in various national costumes form a colorful picture. Aquatic athletes, cyclists and motorcyclists, and runners are all active.

    Not far from the city center, there is a ring of boulevards that runs through the heart of the city. Memorial statues of writers and scientists such as Pushkin, Gogol, and Timiryazev are erected on this boulevard. Many studious people can bring books to read here for two or three hours after work without being disturbed by anyone. Moscow's older citizens and children spend their summer evenings on these boulevards.

    Street gardens and street-corner gardens everywhere are shaded by green trees. Some squares have new fountains installed, and some fountains not only spray white water columns, but the color of the water columns changes at any time, with light blue, emerald green, and other fresh colors appearing after the red.

    There are particularly many cafes and restaurants in the central city area. Stalls and carts selling ice cream and soda are everywhere. At midnight, people who are reluctant to leave the summer night life gradually go home. The music performances in the restaurants stop. City traffic is extended until two or three o'clock. People can get home in time to enjoy the last TV program.

### 莫斯科的夏夜生活

　　莫斯科的夏夜生活
    新华社莫斯科11日电  本报记者李楠报道：莫斯科的时序已经轮到夏季。这里夏天的平均温度不超过二十七度。晚上十点钟以后，淡蓝色的天空才完全变成黑色。但是，丰富多采的莫斯科夏夜生活却在几点钟以前就已经开始了。
    当夏夜生活来临的时候，劳动的莫斯科又结束了一个劳动日，街上整日奔驰的汽车逐渐少了，行人增加了十倍以上。广场上的喷泉开放了，莫斯科河上的汽艇在等待着游客，公园里的音乐演奏传出优雅的旋律，这时最为莫斯科人喜爱的足球比赛也在几个运动场开始了。
    夏夜的莫斯科公园是文化艺术和休息生活的中心。到公园里去，你可以看到来自许多国家的杂技和杂耍，也包括中国的古老的魔术。有时，人们可以欣赏到国际的时装表演。九点钟过后，草场上奏起了轻音乐，人们可以自由地跳舞或表演舞蹈。在浓荫深处，你可以听到有关于文学艺术或国际政治的演讲，那里也同样坐得满满的。
    夏天，莫斯科的剧团都搬到露天剧场演出，一般多是轻松愉快和短小精悍的节目。不过室内的剧场也并不空闲，外城来的和外国来的剧团占据了空出来的剧场。今年观众们将看到伦敦的芭蕾舞和第一次来自日本的歌舞伎。
    今年夏夜，莫斯科的青年还在为准备联欢节忙碌。小规模的联欢节活动到处在进行。在宽阔的莫斯科河的花岗石堤岸上，穿着各色民族服装的青年业余演员、民间歌手组成一幅绚丽的画面。水上运动员、自行车和摩托车运动员、赛跑选手都在活动。
    离市中心不远，有一条环城一周的林荫道，穿过街心。普希金、果戈里、季米里雅泽夫等文学家和科学家的纪念像都竖立在这条林荫道上。许多好学的人在工作以后，可以带着书来在这里看上两三个小时，不会受到谁的干扰。莫斯科的年老的市民和儿童们都在这些林荫道上消度夏日黄昏后的时光。
    到处的街头花园和街心花园都是绿树成荫。有些广场上安置了新的喷泉，有些喷泉不只是喷出白色的水柱，水柱的颜色随时变化，在红色的后面，接着出现了淡蓝、翠绿等新鲜的颜色。
    市中心区的咖啡店和餐厅特别多。卖冰淇淋和汽水的小摊和小车到处皆是。午夜十二点钟，留恋夏夜生活的人们才逐渐归去。餐厅里的音乐演奏才停止。市内交通延长到两三点钟以后。人们回到家里还来得及欣赏最后一个电视节目。
