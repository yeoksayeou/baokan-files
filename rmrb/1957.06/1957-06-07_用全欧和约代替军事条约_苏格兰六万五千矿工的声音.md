    Replace Military Treaties with an All-European Treaty
    The Voice of 65,000 Scottish Miners
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th -- According to a report in today's "Workers' Daily" in Ayr, representatives of 65,000 Scottish miners passed a resolution at their annual meeting on the 5th, demanding that all military treaties be replaced by an all-European peace treaty. Moffat, the vice-chairman of the Scottish Miners' Union, emphasized in his speech that the Warsaw Pact was signed only after the Soviet Union and its partners tried to convince the West that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had expanded the danger of war.
    He criticized the propaganda that the West was in danger of aggression from the East, and the claim that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was peace.

    用全欧和约代替军事条约
    苏格兰六万五千矿工的声音
    新华社伦敦6日电　据今天“工人日报”亚尔消息说，六万五千名苏格兰矿工的代表们5日在年会上通过决议，要求用全欧和平条约来代替所有军事条约。苏格兰矿工工会副主席莫法特在会上发言时强调指出，华沙条约是在苏联和它的伙伴们设法使西方相信北大西洋公约组织扩大了战争危险以后才签订的。
    他批判了所谓西方处于东方的侵略危险中的宣传，和所谓北大西洋公约组织的宗旨是和平的说法。
