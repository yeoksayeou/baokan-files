Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th - The publication in the newspapers of the anonymous threatening letter received by Lu Yuwen has aroused the anger of many factory workers in Tianjin. Tianjin Dyestuff and Chemical Plant No. 7 and other factories held small-scale symposiums yesterday with the participation of workers and staff. Liu Tianlin, a staff member of Dyestuff and Chemical Plant No. 7, said at the meeting that writing anonymous letters is despicable and shameful, and they are afraid to see the light of day. We should be vigilant. Wang Ce, a worker in the red oil workshop, said that we workers resolutely want the Communist Party to lead us on the socialist road, and we have personally experienced that no one can replace the leadership of the Communist Party.

Stone Shoukai, a boiler worker, refuted Chu Anping's remarks about the "Party's World." He said that the formulation of all the Party's policies does not proceed from subjective wishes, but solicits the opinions of the people. For example, the formulation of China's Constitution was repeatedly discussed among the masses of the people. This shows that the Communist Party has always listened to the opinions of the masses. The Party is the Party of the people, and the world belongs to the people. As the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, Chu Anping uttered the fallacy of the so-called "Party's World." May I ask where he stands?

Wang Hongqi criticized Zhang Naiqi's statement that "fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income," saying that since there is "unearned income," there must be someone who "labors more and gains less." Isn't this exploitation?

Six employees of Tianjin No. 2 People's Paper Mill held a symposium. Shen Xishan, a maintenance worker in Workshop 1, said: I was very angry after reading the speeches of Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi. Chu Anping's statement about the "Party's World" is purely a distortion of the facts. Take our factory as an example. Party members who hold leadership positions such as workshop director and team leader account for less than two-tenths. The heads of eight of the twelve departments are non-Party cadres. How can this be said to be the "Party's World"? Ge Peiqi's statement that living standards have not improved is also a blatant lie. Take myself as an example. Before liberation, I worked in the Yangtze River Paper Mill, and the money I earned each month was only enough to buy half a pack of ordinary cigarettes. Now, I earn 80 yuan a month, and my family of five lives a prosperous life. Before liberation, if our workers were injured on the job, no one cared, and there was no talk of their own health. Now, not only do workers who are sick have someone to care for them and can go to the hospital, but even if their family members are sick, the public covers part of the medical expenses. Isn't this an improvement in living standards? I hope that those who say that people's lives have not improved should come to our factory to see the facts.

### 我们亲身体验到谁也不能代替共产党的领导  天津工人驳斥葛佩琦、储安平等的意见

    我们亲身体验到谁也不能代替共产党的领导
    天津工人驳斥葛佩琦、储安平等的意见
    新华社天津9日电　卢郁文收到匿名恐吓信的事在报上公布后，激起了天津市许多工厂职工的愤怒。天津染化第七厂等昨天都举行了有工人和职员参加的小型座谈会，染化七厂职员刘天麟在会上说，写匿名信是卑鄙可耻的，也不敢见太阳。我们应当警惕起来。红油车间工人王策恭说，我们工人坚决要共产党领导走社会主义道路，我们亲身体验到谁也不能代替共产党的领导。
    锅炉工人石寿凯驳斥了储安平的关于“党天下”的言论。他说，党的一切政策的制定不是从主观的愿望出发，而是征求了人民的意见的，如我国宪法的制定，就曾在人民群众中反复地进行了讨论。这说明共产党是一贯倾听人民大众的意见的。党是人民的党，天下是人民的，作为光明日报总编辑的储安平说出所谓“党天下”这种谬论，请问他屁股坐在那里。
    王鸿祺批评章乃器的“定息不是剥削而是不劳而获的收入”的说法说，既然有“不劳而获”，一定有人“多劳少获”，这不是剥削是什么？
    天津市第二人民造纸厂有六名职工进行了座谈，一车间保全工人沈锡山说：我看了储安平和葛佩琦的发言非常气愤，储安平说“党天下”纯粹是歪曲事实。就拿我们厂来说，担任车间主任和班长等领导工作的党员占不到十分之二，十二个科室有八个科室的负责人是非党的干部，这怎么能说是“党天下”？葛佩琦说生活没有提高也是睁着眼说瞎话，就拿我来说吧，解放前在长江造纸厂工作，每月赚的钱只够买半条普通的烟卷。现在，我每月赚八十元，家里五口人生活挺富裕。解放前我们工人因公受伤，没有人管，根本谈不到自己的身体健康。现在不仅工人生病有人管，可以进医院，就连家属生病，公家还给担负一部分医疗费，这不都是生活的改善吗？我希望说人民生活没有提高的人，最好能到我们厂里来看看事实究竟是什么样。
