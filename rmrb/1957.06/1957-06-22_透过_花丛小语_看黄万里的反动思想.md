Seeing Huang Wanli's Reactionary Thoughts Through "Petty Words Among the Flowers"

Qinghua University Teaching Assistant Zi Gang

Huang Wanli's novel "Petty Words Among the Flowers" is filled with venomous reactionary thoughts from beginning to end, and blatantly slanders and vilifies the Party and the government, reflecting the author's extreme dissatisfaction and hatred towards social reality.

It is not difficult to see that the character Zhen Wuji in the novel is the author's alter ego, and what Zhen Wuji says is exactly what the author has in mind. When Zhen Wuji discovered that the renovation design of a certain section of the highway in the western suburbs was not well-considered on his way to visit his old friend Tian Fangsheng, he was filled with anger and cursed the relevant responsible cadres of the Municipal People's Government as "bastards!" Why would Zhen Wuji become so angry as to curse when he saw some shortcomings in our work? Is it because he loves the Party and the government so much that he becomes reckless in his words? No, let's look at what Zhen Wuji says below: "...They keep saying that American politics is corrupt. If such a thing really happened there, the taxpayers would stand up and shout, and the bureau chief and chief engineer would not be able to stay in their positions..." It turns out that in the depths of his heart, he yearns for the American "democratic" system. It turns out that he is not angry about the poorly designed highway renovation project, but dissatisfied with our social system.

The "Ode to the Blooming of a Hundred Flowers" in the novel was written by another character in the novel, Tian Fangsheng. Then, the author uses Zhen Wuji's comments on this poem as a way to vent his dissatisfaction with social reality. The author denies the great social change after liberation, when "the haze was dispelled, and the universe was clear and bright. The smoky and filthy affairs of the world were instantly extinguished;" on the contrary, he believes that our current situation is "the green fades from the branches; how can it withstand the chilling spring and the mournful sound of rain? ... Quietly, there is no voice." In addition, the author also hates others for affirming the Party's achievements, calling these comrades "Goetheans," and describing those who support and love the Party as "Danteans," and scolding these comrades as "the most shameless."

This series of vicious words that slander the Party, distort social reality, and attack those who support and approach the Party completely exposes the author's true thoughts. He hates the Party, hates socialism, hates progressives, and妄想wants to move the so-called "democratic" system of the bourgeoisie to China. But his corrupt words and fallacies cannot withstand a single blow in the face of truth. Let me ask Huang Wanli: In the United States, do the bourgeois parties fight and scold each other in parliament to seize the ruling position of exploiting the laboring people? Is this considered "democracy?" Is it "democracy" when the laboring people are suppressed and persecuted for fighting for their rights? Is it "democracy" to discriminate against and kill black people? What benefits has bourgeois "democracy" brought to the laboring people? Let me ask: After liberation, our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved, and it has forever broken away from the fate of being a semi-colonial country; workers who were previously squeezed and exploited by capitalists have straightened their backs and become masters of society; 500 million farmers have been allocated land and have joined cooperatives; large factories are constantly being built, and people's lives are getting better year by year; the social morality and atmosphere are changing and progressing day by day... How did all this come about? Have you not seen and heard all these living facts? Shouldn't these many achievements be affirmed and worthy of praise? Shouldn't every conscientious person love the Party and get closer to the Party because of this? Of course, you can wear a pair of black glasses and say that it is dark everywhere under the sun, but your nonsense can only arouse our infinite indignation, and it cannot confuse everyone with bright eyes and a sense of justice. We do not need the so-called "democracy" of the bourgeoisie that you yearn for. What we need is the democracy of the broad masses of the people, which is to lead the people to socialism. Your fallacies can never make us leave the Party. Every conscientious person will see and affirm the Party's historically significant achievements, unite more closely around the Party, and unswervingly advance towards socialism under the leadership of the Party.

### 透过“花丛小语”看黄万里的反动思想

　　透过“花丛小语”看黄万里的反动思想
　　清华大学助教　子刚
    黄万里的小说“花丛小语”自始至终充满了恶毒的反动思想，对党和政府进行了露骨的谩骂和污蔑，反映了作者对社会现实的极端不满和仇视的情绪。
    不难看出，小说中甄无忌这个人物正是作者的化身，甄无忌所说的正是作者心里的话。甄无忌在往访老友田方生的途中发现西郊某段公路的翻修设计不周时，竟气愤填胸，把市人民政府的有关负责干部骂成是“王八蛋！”为什么甄无忌看到我们工作中的一些缺点竟会愤怒到出口骂人的程度呢？是不是由于他对党和政府爱护偏激以至于不择言词呢？不是的，请看甄无忌下面这段话：“……尽说美帝政治腐败，那里要真有这样事，纳税人民就要起来叫喊，局长总工程师就当不成……”原来在他的心底深处向往着美国的“民主”制度，原来他气愤的不是公路翻修工程的设计不周，而是对我们的社会制度不满。
    小说中的“百花齐放颂”是小说中另一个人物——田方生写出来的，然后，用甄无忌对这首词作评的手法来发泄自己对社会现实不满的情绪。作者否认解放后“拨开霾气、宇清如彻。人世乌烟瘴气事，一霎熏销烬灭”这一个伟大的社会变化；相反的，他认为如今我们的处境却是“绿尽枝头蘖，怎当他，春寒料峭，雨声凄切？……静悄悄，微言绝。”另外作者还仇视别人肯定党的成绩，把这些同志骂成是“歌德派”，又把拥护党、热爱党的同志说成“但丁派”，骂这些同志“最为无耻”。
    这一连串污蔑党，歪曲社会现实，攻击那些拥护与接近党的同志的刻毒言词彻头彻尾暴露了作者的真实思想。他仇视党，仇视社会主义，仇视进步人士，妄想把资产阶级的那套所谓“民主”制度搬到中国来。但是他的那些腐言滥调在真理面前是经不住一击的。试问黄万里：在美国，资产阶级政党在议院里为争夺剥削劳动人民的统治地位而互相吵骂，这算是“民主”吗？劳动人民为争取自己的权利斗争而遭镇压和迫害，这也是“民主”吗？歧视黑人，杀害黑人，这也是“民主”吗？资产阶级的“民主”给劳动人民究竟带来了多少好处？试问：解放后，我们国家的国际地位空前提高，永远摆脱了半殖民地的命运；过去被资本家压榨、剥削的工人伸直了身子，成了社会的主人；五亿农民分到了田地，参加了合作社；一座座大工厂不断地被建造起来，人民生活一年好似一年；入学人数急剧增加，失业人数越来越少；社会道德和风气一天天变化着，进步着……这一切是怎么得来的？难道这许多活生生的事实你都眼未见，耳未闻吗？难道这许多成绩不应该肯定，不值得歌颂吗？难道每一个有良心的人不应该为此而更热爱党，更靠拢党吗？当然，你尽可以戴着一付黑色眼镜在阳光底下说到处是一片黑暗，但你的那些胡话只能引起我们的无限愤慨，它们迷惑不了每一个眼睛明亮、具有正义感的人。我们不需要你所向往的那套资产阶级的所谓“民主”，我们需要的是广大人民的民主，是把人民引向社会主义的民主。你的那些滥调永远不能使我们离开党。每一个有良心的人都会看到和肯定党的具有历史意义的功绩，更紧密地团结在党的周围，坚定不移地在党的领导下向社会主义前进。
