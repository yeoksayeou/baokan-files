A six-year-old "wolf child" was found in the forest near Agra in Uttar Pradesh, India. He was taken away by wolves at the age of one and a half. Now he can babble some Hindi words, eat bread instead of raw meat, and can play with his brothers and sisters.

Some doctors have examined his intelligence and physique and found him to be quite healthy. With the renewed love and care of his parents, he is quickly getting used to the human environment. (The boy in the picture is the wolf child)

    狼孩渐通人事
    在印度北方省亚格拉附近森林中发现一个六岁的“狼孩”，他是在一岁半时被狼带走的。现在他已经能够咿咿哑哑地说一些印地语单字，吃面包而不吃生肉，而且还能同他的兄弟姐妹在一起玩。
    一些医生对他的智力和体格作了检查，发现他相当健康。在重新得到父母的爱护和照顾下，他正在很快地习惯人类的生活环境。（图中男孩是狼孩）
