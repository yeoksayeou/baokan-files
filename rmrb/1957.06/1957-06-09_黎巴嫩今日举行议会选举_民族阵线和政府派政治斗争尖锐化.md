Beirut News: Lebanon will hold its quadrennial parliamentary elections today (the 9th). The election results will produce a new parliament with sixty-six seats.

    On the eve of the election, the Lebanese capital presents a sharp political situation. The Lebanese public demands that the government pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and solidarity with Arab countries.

    In this Lebanese general election, the government faction and the opposition have distinctly formed two opposing fronts. The focus of their differences is their different attitudes towards the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan. The Lebanese Solh government has accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine," while the various parties of the Lebanese "National Front" and the vast Lebanese public are doing their utmost to oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Washington has expressed unusual "concern" about this Lebanese general election. On the eve of the Lebanese election, the US ambassadors to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon held a meeting in Beirut. The United States considers the current Lebanese government to be "pro-Western" and is worried that if the Lebanese "National Front" wins the election, it will cause serious repercussions in other countries in the Middle East, which will be detrimental to the United States' implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan in the Middle East.

    黎巴嫩今日举行议会选举
    民族阵线和政府派政治斗争尖锐化
    本报讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩全国于今天（9日）举行四年一度的议会选举，选举结果将要产生一个拥有六十六个席位的新议会。
    在选举前夕，黎巴嫩首都呈现着尖锐的政治局势。黎巴嫩公众要求政府奉行和平中立和阿拉伯国家团结的政策。
    在这次黎巴嫩的大选中，政府派和反对派已截然形成两个对立的阵线。它们之间分歧的焦点是对“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划抱着不同的态度。黎巴嫩索勒哈政府已经接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，而黎巴嫩“民族阵线”各党派及黎巴嫩广大公众则竭力反对“艾森豪威尔主义”。华盛顿对这次黎巴嫩的普选表示异常“关心”。在黎巴嫩选举前夕，美国驻埃及、约旦、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的大使曾在贝鲁特举行会议。美国认为黎巴嫩现政府是“亲西方”的，它担心如果黎巴嫩“民族阵线”在选举中获胜，会在中东其它国家引起严重的反响，不利于美国在中东地区执行“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划。
