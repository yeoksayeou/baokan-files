Yang Mingxuan Suggests the Party Strengthen Education on the Legal System for Party Members and All People
He said: Some Localities Do Not Separate Party and Government, Violating the Principles of Socialist Democracy

Yang Mingxuan first discussed the issue of the lack of separation between the Party and the government in his speech. He believes that this issue in some areas has violated the principles of socialist democracy and the socialist legal system. For example, during his inspection in Guangxi and Guangdong last winter, he found that major work in some prefectures, counties, and townships was often not discussed and approved by the People's Congress or the People's Committee, but was decided and implemented by the local CCP organizations or cadre meetings. As a result, the People's Congress and the People's Committee could not be convened on schedule, and the people could not exercise their power to manage the country through their elected representatives and government members. He believes that the existence of the problem of the lack of separation between the Party and the government is inseparable from the Party's insufficient attention to the socialist legal system. Therefore, he suggested that the Party should strengthen education on the legal system for Party members and all people, pay attention to leadership in this area, strictly implement existing laws, regulations, and systems, and gradually improve China's socialist legal system.

He Saw That Some Regions Neither Trusted Nor Tried to Help Non-Party Personages

Secondly, he talked about the issue of positions and powers for non-Party personages. He said that during his inspection, he found that the prefecture heads, deputy prefecture heads, county heads, deputy county heads, and even deputy governors who were non-Party members in some areas often had very little specific work assigned to them. Even so, some matters were often completed without anyone reporting to them. In some areas, even office meetings and People's Committee meetings were rarely held. This hindered the development of the work enthusiasm of non-Party personages. He believes that this problem essentially reflects the sectarian sentiments of some organizations and Party members within the Communist Party. They neither trusted non-Party personages to do things well nor tried to help them, which resulted in affecting the enthusiasm of non-Party personages and failing to do things successfully themselves. He believes that as long as non-Party personages can proceed from the interests of the Party and the country, and socialism, and can work diligently and conscientiously, the Communist Party and the people will inevitably trust and respect them. Conversely, if non-Party personages, like those Communist Party members who are now being criticized, are idle all day long, or are arrogant and care about gains and losses, they will certainly not do things well and will naturally not gain the trust of the Communist Party and the masses.

He Believes That the Mistakes of Individual Party Organizations and Members Cannot Be Confused with the Entire Party

When talking about the issue of removing walls and filling ditches, he pointed out that the mistakes of certain Party members should be distinguished from the greatness and correctness of the Party, and the mistakes of individual Party organizations and individual Party members cannot be confused with the entire Party. He believes that the existence of walls and ditches in some places is primarily inseparable from the arrogance and complacency of certain Communist Party organizations and Party members. He suggested that the Communist Party should, at an appropriate time, launch an inspection of the implementation of the United Front policy both inside and outside the Party to remove walls and fill ditches. This alone is not enough, because walls and ditches will continue to be built or dug up. A concentrated inspection for a certain period can certainly play a significant role; however, regular removal of walls and filling of ditches is more important. Therefore, a system should also be established, such as restoring bi-weekly symposiums, to ensure that incidents of building walls and digging ditches are minimized. The central government should do this, and so should local governments.

He also believes that another aspect of the existence of walls and ditches is the issue of democratic parties and non-Party personages. He believes that this aspect is also very important. Because in cooperation with the Communist Party, are all of us non-Party personages sincerely interacting? Do we all believe in the correct leadership of the Party and dare to fight against unhealthy phenomena? He believes that this is not entirely the case. Sometimes, even if non-Party personages have correct opinions, they are full of concerns and do not speak out truthfully. Many of the opinions expressed this time, he fears, have been accumulated for a long time. Over time, this naturally leads to doubts about the leadership of the Party and a certain degree of vigilance. Therefore, he agrees that removing walls and filling ditches is a two-way effort, and everyone must participate to do it well.

He Believes That Communist Party Members Should Fully Recognize the Role of Democratic Parties; Democratic Parties Should Adhere to the Communist Party as the Leading Core

Finally, he talked about the issue of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. He believes that the central issue of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is the issue of common progress. As long as certain organizations and Party members within the Communist Party are humble, they will fully recognize the due role of democratic parties in China's revolution and give them sufficient attention. He believes that after this rectification campaign, this issue will inevitably be further resolved. On the part of democratic parties, they should first continue to strengthen their belief in the Communist Party as the leading core, trust in the correctness of the Party's leadership, and trust that only the leadership of the Communist Party can build socialism. He believes that as long as democratic parties can adhere to the Communist Party as the leading core, they will inevitably humbly study Marxism-Leninism, further seek transformation and progress, and with progress, they will inevitably be able to contribute their own strength to socialist construction together with the Party. Conversely, if they do not take the Communist Party as the leading core and do not study humbly, progress will be difficult. If they do not make progress for a long time, they will not be loved by the people and will not be able to regularly offer useful opinions to the Party and supervise it.

He Guiyan Said: "Forgiveness" Is a Necessary Moral Quality for Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People

He Guiyan said in a written statement: United Front work accounted for a large proportion of the factors in the success of the Chinese revolution, which has already been summarized in the history of the Chinese revolution. Everyone knows that the United Front involves both unity and struggle, and it seeks unity through struggle. In this way, the revolution achieved rapid success. However, mentioning struggle and unity, it is all based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. In the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, it was also combined with the actual situation in China to achieve rapid success. I know that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party implemented the "three-thirds system" of personnel arrangements in the anti-Japanese base areas, which made many non-Party personages (including the Kuomintang and other parties, non-party democratic personages) feel that the Communist Party had already done what they hoped for, and there was no need to ask for more. It was just that they had no work performance to enjoy these results, and they felt ashamed. Therefore, everyone strived to help the Communist Party in various ways. In this way, the success of the revolution came faster than people expected, and there was a reason for it. This "three-thirds system" of personnel arrangements, I think, in addition to demonstrating the developed political art of Marxism-Leninism, more profoundly embodies the Chinese traditional "forgiveness." It starts from the "forgiveness" of "the Communist Party wants me to have it, but also wants others to have it," and it is produced from the spirit of putting oneself in another's shoes. This kind of "forgiveness" runs through China's three thousand years of history and forms the traditional thinking of the Chinese people. I think "forgiveness" is extremely needed when dealing with contradictions among the people. Because with "forgiveness," it is possible to educate those who have made mistakes in a gentle and kind way. Therefore, it is said that "forgiveness" is a necessary moral quality for correctly handling contradictions among the people, because it is different from antagonistic struggle. Therefore, as long as there is a period in which contradictions among the people exist, it can play a role. "Forgiveness" was originally the moral standard of feudal society. In today's words, it is a kind of "self-other" relationship, which has appeared countless times in old Chinese books. For example, "to extend oneself to others is called forgiveness," "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," "help others to establish themselves and help others to succeed" can all become the balancing standard of "self-other."

Chairman Mao spoke at the Supreme State Council on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, in which many places developed Marxism-Leninism; in my opinion, many places also contain the truth of the word "forgiveness." For example, when it comes to freedom of belief, Chairman Mao said: "You cannot force people not to believe in religion, not to believe in idealism." He also said: "The bourgeoisie needs to be transformed," while also pointing out: "Who says the working class does not need to be transformed?!" For example, when it comes to the long-term coexistence of democratic parties, Chairman Mao said: "However long the Communist Party exists, that is how long the democratic parties exist." These words all contain the positive meaning of putting oneself in another's shoes. As for the characteristics of the Chinese revolution—the characteristics of changing the ownership of the means of production, not adopting the method of deprivation, in addition to giving capitalists a fixed interest, also giving them food and work. This contains "forgiveness." These are all principles of putting oneself in another's shoes and comparing hearts. It makes the work of the Chinese revolution penetrate people's hearts, truly the so-called: the influence of virtue spreads faster than the post office. How can the rapid success of the revolution be water without a source?!

Looking back at the three evils that are being rectified now: bureaucracy in work, sectarianism in organization, and subjectivism in thought, especially those who have committed the latter two evils, are the ones who have raised the most opinions this time. Now I want to bring out their ideological roots for criticism. Do their thoughts still have some shadow of "forgiveness"—putting oneself in another's shoes? I think not, they have self and no others. Even if it is said that they have not clearly seen the historical factors of the Communist Party's revolutionary success, it is not too much.

First of all, speaking of those who have committed the error of sectarianism, when he promotes cadres, he does not focus on virtue and ability, but harbors sectarian sentiments. He not only does not see others in his eyes, but also does not see the cause of the revolution in his eyes.

Secondly, speaking of those who have committed the error of subjectivism and commandism, they not only do not handle problems from objective reality, but also do not consider problems by putting themselves in the shoes of others, so many of the Party's policies have problems in implementation below. This is certainly due to their lack of Marxist-Leninist cultivation, and I think it is still due to the lack of the ordinary truth of "forgiveness." I have such an idea: is it possible to critically talk about China's traditional moral thoughts in Marxist-Leninist lectures, absorb the factors that are beneficial to the cause of the people, and abandon its feudal dross, which will be beneficial and harmless to the revolution.

Speaking of United Front work, it is even more necessary to unite people from many different classes. This should only improve the ideological understanding of non-Party personages to achieve the goal of unity, and should never make Party members compromise with backwardness to seek unity. However, there should be a process in improving the ideological understanding of non-Party personages. If it is found that non-Party personages have wrong understandings, the wrong motives should be specifically analyzed, and positive help should be given in a gentle and kind way, so as to convince people. In today's situation where there have been great developments in the objective situation, it is obvious that the work has fallen behind the requirements of reality if a distrustful and rude attitude is still adopted towards the mistakes of non-Party personages. Mr. Wang Shao'ao's first speech involved the issue of the United Front Work Department's attitude towards democratic personages, and I agree with it.

Xu Boxin Criticizes Cultural and Publishing Departments for Not Seriously Handling Opinions Raised by Democratic Parties

1. Relevant Departments Should Seriously Handle Opinions Reflected by Democratic Parties

Xu Boxin said: There are three main aspects to the work of democratic parties: first, education and learning; second, expanding the scope of unity and close ties with the masses; and third, seriously handling the opinions reflected by members and the masses they contact. Education and learning are certainly the primary work, but seriously handling reflected opinions is an important task.

The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) convened its Second National Congress in August last year. Through preparatory work before the meeting and the full promotion of democracy during the meeting, it reflected many problems and opinions in various aspects such as primary and secondary education, culture, and publishing, and also provided specific suggestions. We sent them to the relevant departments for research and handling.

According to the Ministry of Education's reply to the CAPD on December 24 last year, the opinions and suggestions we reflected were summarized by the Ministry of Education into nine fundamental and major issues after research, and the education departments of various provinces and cities were notified to include them in their work plans. At the same time, investigation teams were organized to conduct further investigations and research in six provinces and cities. Problems that can be solved immediately have been solved separately, and for problems that are currently difficult and can only be solved gradually, we are asked to explain them clearly to everyone.

Such a reply still needs to be further checked in the implementation process, but this kind of reply shows respect and serious handling of the opinions reflected by democratic parties, which can encourage democratic parties to help the Party and state organs widely absorb opinions from all aspects and help promote and improve work. As a helper of the Party, democratic parties are also more willing to fully play the role of mutual supervision.

However, how have the cultural and publishing departments and other relevant departments handled the opinions we have reflected? So far, there is no news at all, like a stone sinking into the sea. This indifferent attitude is wrong. Ordinary people's letters should be handled seriously. Why is the opinion reflected by democratic parties so ignored? This inevitably makes people suspect that democratic parties are dispensable.

I suggest that democratic parties and relevant departments should establish regular contact, and both parties can be notified to send people to participate in important meetings. The opinions reflected by democratic parties must be accounted for and have a resolution.

2. The United Front Work Department Does Not Have Enough Contact, Concern, and Assistance for the Work of Democratic Parties

From my personal experience, I feel that the United Front Work Department does not have enough contact, concern, and assistance for the work of democratic parties. Of course, we cannot erase the fact that the United Front Work Department has provided great help to the work of our democratic parties. When the CAPD held its National Congress in August last year, it was shortly after the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, and many new problems were facing us and needed to be solved. The United Front Work Department promptly accepted our suggestion and invited Minister Li Weihan to have a long talk with our central leaders. We jointly studied the important policies and tasks at the time and put forward many valuable opinions, especially encouraging us to fully play the supervisory role of democratic parties at this conference. This sincere help was very important for us to hold that meeting well. This shows how much benefit the serious help of the United Front Work Department can bring to our democratic parties. Since there are benefits, then why not give us more help? This is exactly what I want to criticize the United Front Work Department for.

I say that the United Front Work Department does not have enough contact, concern, and assistance for us on weekdays, mainly in two points:

(1) It does not help us enough to improve politically and ideologically and in our work. The help we received at the time of the National Congress, as I said above, is only at most once a year. There are few opportunities to study problems with us on weekdays, especially in the current new situation of great changes, and in the case of rapid development of our democratic party organizations, a major contradiction within our democratic parties is that members demand strengthened ideological leadership, and our leadership work cannot keep up with the increasingly strong demands of members. How can democratic parties strengthen ideological leadership? Of course, democratic parties themselves must study and improve, but more importantly, the Party must give more help politically, ideologically, and in its work. For example, this time the Party started the rectification campaign, and the United Front Work Department convened such a symposium to invite us to speak out and help the Party eliminate the three evils. This is very good, but the United Front Work Department has not yet consulted with us on how we should lead our local organizations to carry out work to help the Party in the rectification campaign. Now our organizations and members in various places are very active and all have the desire to play an active role in helping the Party in the rectification campaign. I think that for such important work, the Central United Front Work Department should study it with us.

(2) The comrades of the United Front Work Department have too little contact with comrades from all aspects of our democratic parties on weekdays. Many of our comrades have their own views on United Front work. They have closer ties with the masses. They very much hope to have the opportunity to have more contact with the comrades of the United Front Work Department, to talk heart-to-heart, communicate with each other, and also hope to directly reflect the opinions of the masses they are close to to the United Front Work Department, but the comrades of the United Front Work Department rarely take the initiative to contact them. I don't know if it is because the comrades of the United Front Work Department are busy with affairs and cannot spare the time, or if there is bureaucracy. I hope that this rectification campaign can check it out.

3. The Grassroots Organizations of the Communist Party Should Attach Importance to the Grassroots Organizational Work of Democratic Parties in Their Own Units

The grassroots organizations of democratic parties should be the base for playing the role of the party. Whether its work can be carried out depends not only on whether the organization itself is sound, but more importantly, on whether the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party attach importance to the role of the grassroots of democratic parties. Because the Party is the leading core for building socialism, the Party organizations in organs, schools, and enterprises are the leading core of the organs, schools, and enterprises. The grassroots organizations of the Party respect the grassroots organizations of democratic parties, give them trust, sincerely cooperate in their work, and fully utilize and play their role, which is beneficial to the country and the people. However, the reality is not entirely the case.

Taking the CAPD as an example, I think that the relationship between the current grassroots organizations and the Party roughly falls into the following three categories. The first category is those with good cooperation. The Party's grassroots organizations have always attached importance to our grassroots work. They closely contact the masses through us, and when deploying central work, they can take the initiative to contact us and invite representatives from our grassroots organizations to participate in joint research. They explain the Party's policies and guidelines to us, make requests to us, listen to our opinions, and unite and contact the masses through us to reflect the opinions and demands of the masses. For example, last year, many units used the power of party factions, and the work of wage reform was done better. The second category is that they respect each other as guests, very politely. They are respected on the surface, but rarely receive regular help and support. This situation is relatively common. The third category is that they do not listen to our opinions, nor do they ask us to cooperate in our work, and even discriminate against us. When convening joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League to deploy work, they do not want democratic parties to participate, and they fundamentally do not have a status for democratic parties in their minds. They think that having democratic parties is troublesome. Some Party members in schools believe that the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is the Party's "gift" to democratic parties. Some are afraid that democratic parties will raise opinions, and even say, "We won the world, how can you supervise me?" This sectarian situation is serious. Although this situation is in the minority, it is intolerable.

I suggest that the Party conduct an inspection on how to implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision at the grassroots level, summarize and exchange good experiences, and vigorously overcome those Party members or Party grassroots organizations who have committed sectarianism through this rectification movement, and regularly conduct education on the United Front policy within the Party grassroots organizations to change this unhealthy phenomenon.

Shao Lizi Suggests Strengthening Publicity on Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Shao Lizi said in his speech that the Party's commemorative activities for the 30th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death last year were very moving and had great educational significance both inside and outside the Party. However, the Party's commemorative activities for Mr. Sun Yat-sen are still not many, and education in this area is not enough. Last year, Tsinghua University asked me to give a lecture. I saw photos of world celebrities in the reception room, but there was no photo of Mr. Sun Yat-sen; this year, I went to a factory and saw the same situation. If only Chairman Mao's portrait is hung, I have no objection; but if portraits of foreigners are hung (of course, not referring to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin), but not Mr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait, I have an objection.

He said that last year I went to Guangdong for inspection and visited the Peasant Movement Training Institute. The person who introduced it introduced it in detail, but there was not a word about Mr. Sun Yat-sen, nor was there any exhibition of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speeches. I felt very uncomfortable at the time. The Peasant Movement Training Institute was fully organized by Chairman Mao, but Mr. Sun Yat-sen had an article about the Peasant Movement Training Institute. Why not put it in?

Shao Lizi said: The Revolution of 1911 led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a bourgeois revolution, which is correct. But this only needs to be mentioned when it is juxtaposed with the New Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party, and it does not need to be mentioned like this normally. Originally, this analysis and evaluation of the Revolution of 1911 did not mean to look down on the Revolution of 1911; however, young people have dogmatic phenomena when learning theory, and they easily underestimate the achievements of the bourgeois democratic revolution, thinking that the bourgeois revolution is reactionary and meaningless.

Shao Lizi gave an example: Last year, when we were solemnly commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen, among the articles published by the Party newspapers, it was mentioned that Sun Yat-sen was not a socialist. I disagree with this statement. There are various forms of socialism. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism. Even if Mr. Sun Yat-sen is not a socialist, why say this when commemorating him? We don't think there is anything wrong with this sentence, but young people easily misunderstand it, thinking that Mr. Sun Yat-sen is not worth learning from or commemorating.

    在统战部召开的民主人士座谈会上的发言（续昨）
    杨明轩建议党加强对党员和对全体人民法制思想的教育
    他说：某些地方党政不分，违背了社会主义民主的原则
    杨明轩在发言中首先谈到党、政不分的问题，他认为这个问题在某些地方已经违背了社会主义民主和社会主义法制的原则。例如去年冬天他在广西、广东视察中，发现一些州、县、乡的重大工作，往往都没有经过人民代表大会或人民委员会的讨论和通过，有不少是由当地的中共组织或干部会议来决定实施的。其结果就是人民代表大会和人民委员会不能按期召开，人民不能通过自己选举出来的代表和政府委员行使自己管理国家的权力，他认为党、政不分问题的存在，是和党的领导不够重视社会主义的法制分不开的。因此他建议党应当加强对党员对全体人民法制思想的教育，并且注意对这方面的工作领导，严格执行已有的法律、规章、制度，逐渐完备我国社会主义的法制。
    他看到有些地区对党外人士既不放心，又不设法帮助
    其次他谈到党外人士的有职有权问题，他说他在视察中发现有些地区党外人士的州长、副州长、县长、副县长甚至副省长往往具体分工管理的工作本来不多，但是就是这样，还常常有些事情已经办完了，还没有人向他们报告；有些地区甚至办公会议和人民委员会议也很少召开。这样，就妨碍了非党人士工作积极性的发挥，这个问题，我认为实质上反映了共产党内某些组织和党员的宗派主义情绪，他们既不放心非党人士能够把事情办好，又不设法帮助非党人士，结果影响了非党人士的积极性，自己也没有把事情办得成功。他认为只要非党人士能够从党和国家的，社会主义的利益出发，而且能够踏踏实实地埋头工作，把事情办好了，共产党和人民就必然会相信自己，尊重自己。相反，如果非党人士像现在批评的那些共产党员那样，饱食终日，无所用心，或者骄傲自大，计较得失，当然就不会把事情办好，自然也不会取得共产党和人民群众的信任。
    他认为不能把个别党组织和党员的错误同整个党混同起来
    在谈到拆墙填沟的问题时，他指出要把某些党员的错误，同党的伟大和正确加以区别，不能把个别党组织、个别党员的错误同整个的党混在一起来谈。他认为，所以在某些地方有墙和沟，首先是和某些共产党的组织和党员的骄傲自满分不开的，他建议共产党应当在适当时期，发动党内外一起来检查统战政策的执行情况，以便拆墙填沟。仅仅如此还不够，因为墙和沟是会不断地筑起来或者挖起来的，一定时期的集中检查，当然可以起很大的作用；但是经常的拆墙、填沟则更重要，所以还应该建立制度例如恢复双周座谈会那样，来保证筑墙、挖沟的事件尽量减少；中央如此，地方也应如此。
    他还认为所以有墙和沟的另一方面，就是民主党派，党外人士的问题，他认为这一方面也很重要。因为在和共产党合作共事中我们非党人士是否都很诚恳相处呢？是否都相信党的正确领导而敢于向不良现象进行斗争呢？他认为还不完全是这样。有时候非党人士纵然有正确的意见但却顾虑重重，不实事求是地讲出来，像这次讲出的很多意见，恐怕很多都是很早积累起来的。这样久而久之，自然也就产生了对党的领导的怀疑，有所戒备。因此他同意拆墙填沟，是两方面的事，大家都要来动手才能做得好。
    他认为共产党员要充分认识到民主党派的作用；民主党派要坚持以共产党为领导核心
    最后他谈了长期共存互相监督的问题。他认为长期共存、互相监督的中心问题是共同进步的问题。共产党内某些组织和党员只要虚心了，就会充分认识到民主党派在我国革命中的应有作用而给予足够的重视，他相信党经过这次整风，这个问题必然会进一步得到解决，民主党派方面首先应当继续加强以共产党为领导核心的信念，应该信任党的领导的正确，应该信任只有共产党的领导才能建成社会主义，他认为只要民主党派能够坚持以共产党为领导核心，就必然能够虚心学习马列主义，进一步求得改造与进步，有了进步也就必然能够在社会主义建设中和党一道贡献出自己的力量来。相反，如果不以共产党为领导核心，不虚心学习，进步是很困难的；如果长期不进步，那将不被人民所爱戴，也将不能向党经常提出有益的意见而给予监督。贺贵严说：“恕道”是正确处理人民
    内部矛盾必备的道德品质
    贺贵严在书面发言中说：统战工作在中国革命成功的因素中占了很大的比重，这在中国革命史上是已经做了总结的。谁都知道：统一战线是有团结也有斗争的，而且它还是以斗争来求团结的。这样，革命才得到迅速的成功。不过，提到斗争和团结，都是根据马列主义的原则，它在中国革命具体实践中，还结合了中国的实际，才能迅速成功的。我知道在抗日战争当中，共产党在抗日根据地的政治上，实施了“三三制”的人事安排，使许多非党人士（包括国民党的和其他党派、无党派的民主人士）都感到：他们所希望的，共产党已经代做了，用不着再来要求。只是自己没有一些工作表现，就享有这些成果，感到惭愧。因而每一个人都争取从各方面努力来帮助共产党。这样，革命成功快到出乎人们意料之外，不是没有原因的。这个“三三制”的人事安排，我以为除了表现着发展了的马列主义的政治艺术而外，更深刻地体现了中国传统的“恕道”。它是从“共产党要我有，也要人家有”的“恕道”出发的，是从推己及人的精神产生出来的。这种“恕道”直贯中国三千年的历史，形成了中国人的传统思想。我以为“恕道”在处理人民内部矛盾的时候是极为需要的。因为有了“恕道”就可以和风细雨地对犯有错误的人进行教育，所以说“恕道”是正确处理人民内部矛盾必须具备的道德品质，因为它并不同于对抗性斗争的。所以只要有人民内部矛盾存在的时期，它是能够发生作用的。“恕道”原是封建社会的道德标准，用今天的话来解释，它是一种“人己”的关系，这在中国的旧书中不知出现过多少次，譬如说：“推己及人谓之恕”、“己所不欲，勿施于人”、“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人”都可以成为“人己”的平衡标准。
    毛主席在最高国务会议上讲的正确处理人民内部的矛盾问题，其中许多地方发展了马克思列宁主义；我的看法，其中许多地方也包含着“恕”字的道理。例如：说到信仰自由，毛主席说：“你不能强迫人家不信宗教，不信唯心主义。”又说：“资产阶级要改造”，同时又指出：“谁说工人阶级不要改造？！”又如：讲到民主党派长期共存的时候，毛主席就说：“共产党有多长，民主党派就有多长。”这些话都含有推己及人的积极意义。至于中国革命的特点——改变生产资料所有制的特点，不采取剥夺的方式，除给与资本家以定息之外，还给与饭吃，给与工作。这就包含着“恕道”。这都是推己及彼，将心比心的道理。使中国的革命工作，无一不深入人心，真是所谓：德之流行速于置邮传命。革命成功之快，岂是无源之水？！
    反观现在要整的三害：工作中的官僚主义、组织上的宗派主义、思想上的主观主义，特别是犯了后面两害的人，是这次意见提得最多的，我现在想对他们的思想根源举出来批判一下。他们的思想中是否还有些“恕道”——推己及人的影子呢？我想是没有的，他们是有己无人的。即使说他们没有看清楚共产党革命成功的历史因素，也不算太过分吧。
    首先，讲犯宗派主义错误的人，他在提拔干部的时候，不在贤能上着眼，而怀着宗派情绪，他不仅眼睛里没有看到别人，也就是眼睛里没有看到革命事业。
    其次，讲犯主观主义、强迫命令错误的人，他们不仅没有从客观实际出发来处理问题，而且也没有推己及人来考虑问题，所以党的许多政策到下面执行上就发生了问题。这固然是由于他们缺乏马列主义的修养，我以为还是缺乏“恕道”的这一平凡真理所致。我有这样一种设想：可以不可以在马列主义的理论讲座中，同时批判地谈谈中国传统的道德思想，吸取其中有益于人民大众事业的因素，扬弃它带有封建性质的糟粕，这于革命会是有益无损的。
    说到统战工作，更是要把许多不同阶层的人团结起来，这只应提高非党人士的思想认识来达到统一的目的，绝不应使党员迁就落后来求得统一。不过在提高非党人士的思想认识时，是应该有一个过程的。如果发现非党人士有了错误认识的时候，对于错误的动机，应该进行具体的分析，采取和风细雨的方式，给以正面的帮助，才能使人心服。在客观形势已经有了大的发展的今天，还采取不信任和粗暴的态度来对待非党人士的错误，显然是工作已经落后于现实的要求了。王绍鏊先生第一次发言，涉及到统战部对民主人士的态度问题，我是同意的。
    徐伯昕批评文化出版部门没有认真处理民主党派提出的意见
    一、民主党派反映的意见，有关部门应当认真处理
    徐伯昕说：民主党派的工作主要有三个方面，第一是教育和学习工作；第二是扩大团结面和密切联系群众；第三是认真处理成员和所联系的群众所反映的意见。教育和学习工作，固然是首要工作，但是认真处理反映的意见更是一项重要工作。
    民进去年8月间召开了第二次全国代表大会，通过会前的准备工作和会议期间的充分发扬民主，对中小教育、文化、出版等各方面反映了不少的问题和意见，有的还提供了具体建议，我们都分别送请有关部门研究处理。
    根据教育部去年12月24日给民进的答复，对我们反映的意见和建议，经过教育部研究后归纳为九项带根本性的重大问题，已通知各省、市教育部门列入工作计划，同时组织了调查组分赴六省、市作进一步调查研究。对其中可以马上解决的问题，已在分别解决，对目前还有困难而只能逐步解决的问题，要我们向大家解释清楚。
    这样的答复，一部分还有待于在执行中作进一步的检查，但是这种答复就表现了尊重和认真处理了民主党派反映的意见，是可以鼓舞民主党派帮助党和国家机关广泛吸取各方面的意见，对推动和改进工作是有帮助的。作为党的助手的民主党派来说，也更愿意充分发挥互相监督的作用。
    但是文化出版部门和其他有关部门对我们反映的意见处理得怎样呢，至今音信杳然，石沉大海，这种置之不理的态度是不对的，一般人民来信都应认真处理，为什么对民主党派反映的意见竟如此忽视呢，这就难免被怀疑民主党派的可有可无了。
    我建议民主党派和有关部门应建立经常的联系，双方有重要会议可以通知派人参加。对民主党派反映的意见，必须做到有交代、有着落。
    二、统战部对民主党派工作的联系、关心和帮助不够
    从我切身的体会来说，我觉得统战部对民主党派工作的联系、关心、帮助不够。当然，我们不能抹杀事实，统战部对我们民主党派工作的帮助是很大的。去年8月民进开全国代表大会，那正是长期共存互相监督方针提出不久，许多新的问题摆在面前有待解决，统战部及时接受了我们的建议，由李维汉部长邀得我们中央领导同志长谈了一次，和我们共同研究了当前的重要方针任务，提出了不少宝贵意见，特别是鼓励我们要在这次大会充分发挥民主党派的监督作用。使我们这次会议有了明确的方向。这样诚恳的帮助，对我们开好那次会的关系是很大的，由此可见，统战部的认真帮助，对于我们民主党派有多么大的好处。既然有好处，那末为什么不更多地给我们以帮助呢？正是这一点，就是我要向统战部提出批评的地方。
    我说统战部平日对我们联系、关心、帮助不够，主要有两点：
    （一）从政治思想上、从工作上帮助我们提高不够，像我上面所说的在开代表大会时给我们的那样帮助究竟最多只有一年一次，平时和我们共同研究问题的机会很少，尤其在现在这大变动的新形势下，在我们民主党派的组织有了迅速发展的情况下，我们民主党派内部的一个主要矛盾是成员要求加强思想领导，而我们的领导工作赶不上成员日益强烈的要求，民主党派如何加强思想领导工作，固然要民主党派自己研究改进，更重要的还在党从政治思想方面，工作方面多给帮助。例如这次党开始整风，统战部召开这样的座谈会，约我们来放、鸣，帮助党除三害，这很好，但是关于我们应如何领导我们各地方组织进行工作，以帮助党整风，统战部还没有和我们共同商量，现在我们各地组织和会员积极性都很高，都有愿望要帮助党在整风中发挥积极作用，我想像这样重大的工作，中央统战部应该和我们共同研究一下。
    （二）统战部同志和我们民主党派各方面的同志平时接触联系太少了，我们有不少同志对统战工作是有自己的见解的，他们与群众较有密切的联系，他们很希望有机会和统战部的同志多接触，能促膝谈心，互通声气，也希望能把他们所接近的群众的意见直接向统战部反映，但是统战部同志却很少主动与他们接触，这不知是因为统战部的同志事务繁忙，抽不出时间来呢，还是有官僚主义，希望在这次整风中能检查一下。
    三、共产党的基层组织应当重视本单位民主党派的基层组织工作
    民主党派的基层组织应当是发挥党派作用的基地。它的工作能否开展，固然在于组织本身是否健全，但是更重要的还在于共产党的基层组织是否重视民主党派的基层的作用。因为党是建设社会主义的领导核心，机关、学校企业的党组织就是该机关学校企业的领导核心。党的基层组织尊重民主党派的基层组织，给以信任，在工作中真诚合作，充分运用和发挥它的作用，对于国家，对于人民是有好处的。但是现实情况并不完全是这样。
    以民进来说，我以为目前的基层组织和党的关系大体有下列三种情况。第一种情况是合作得好的，党的基层组织一贯重视我们的基层工作，通过我们密切联系群众，布置中心工作的时候能够主动和我们联系，约邀我们基层组织的代表参加共同研究。向我们说明党的政策方针，对我们提出要求，听取我们的意见，通过我们团结联系群众，反映群众的意见和要求。比如去年有不少单位运用了党派的力量，工资改革工作就做得比较好。第二种情况是彼此相敬如宾，客客气气。表面受到尊重，实际上很少得到经常的帮助和支持。这种情况是比较普遍。第三种情况是不听取我们的意见，也不要求我们配合工作，甚至有所歧视，召开党、政、工、团联席会议布置工作时，不要民主党派参加，思想上根本没有民主党派地位。认为有民主党派是麻烦。有的学校党员认为长期共存互相监督的方针是党对民主党派的“恩赐”，有的怕民主党派提意见，甚至有“天下是我们打的，你怎么能监督我”的说法。这种宗派主义情形是严重的。这种情况虽然是少数，但是不能令人容忍的。
    我建议党对在基层中如何贯彻长期共存互相监督的方针进行一次检查，把好的经验总结和交流，对那些犯有宗派主义的党员或者党的基层组织通过这次整风运动大力加以克服，并且在党的基层组织内经常进行统战政策的教育，以改变这种不健康的现象。
    邵力子建议加强对孙中山先生的宣传
    邵力子在发言中说，去年党对孙中山先生逝世三十周年的纪念活动，很使人感动，对党内外的教育意义都很大。但是，党对孙中山先生的纪念活动，还是不多的，这方面的教育还不够。去年清华大学要我去讲演，我看到会客室里有世界伟人的照片，但是没有孙中山先生的照片；今年到一个工厂去，也看到同样情况。如果只挂毛主席像，我没有意见；但是如果挂上外国人的肖像（当然，不是指马、恩、列、斯），而不挂中山先生肖像，我有意见。
    他说，去年我到广东视察，参观了农民运动讲习所。介绍的人介绍得很详细，但是，没有一句提到孙中山先生，也没有孙中山先生的讲演陈列。当时我心里很难受。农民运动讲习所是由毛主席全力组织的，但是孙中山先生有篇文章讲农民运动讲习所，为什么不放进去呢？
    邵力子说：孙中山先生所领导的辛亥革命是资产阶级革命，这是对的。但这只是在和中国共产党领导的新民主主义革命并列时可以这样提，平常不必这样提。本来，对辛亥革命的这种分析、估计，并没有看不起辛亥革命的意思；但是青年人在学习理论的时候，有教条主义现象，容易低估资产阶级民主革命的成绩，以为资产阶级革命就是反动的，没有意义的。
    邵力子举例说：去年我们正在隆重纪念孙中山先生的时候，党报发表的文章当中，提到孙中山不是社会主义者，我不同意这种说法。社会主义有各种形式。孙中山先生说民生主义就是社会主义。就算孙中山先生不是社会主义者，为什么在纪念他的时候这样说呢？这句话，我们看起来没有什么，年轻人就容易误解，以为孙中山先生不值得学习，不值得纪念。
