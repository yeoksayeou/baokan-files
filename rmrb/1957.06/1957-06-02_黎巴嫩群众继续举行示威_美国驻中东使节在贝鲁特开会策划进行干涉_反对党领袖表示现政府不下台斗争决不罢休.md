    According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches of June 1st: Syrian newspapers report that the situation within Lebanon is extremely tense. "Al-Shaab" [The People's Daily in Arabic] emphasizes that the US government is doing everything possible to support the current Lebanese government.
    According to the Associated Press, the US ambassadors to Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria are holding talks in Beirut.
    Following demonstrations on May 30th, Beirut witnessed another opposition-organized demonstration on May 31st.
    Three thousand people gathered at a mosque to listen to a speech by opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yafi, who condemned the government for the bloodshed inflicted upon innocent people during the May 30th demonstration. However, before the participants could begin their march, government troops entered the square and dispersed them. According to UPI, two people were injured by the police.
    The Solh government announced that the parliamentary elections on June 9th would proceed as scheduled, and "the army will assist in supervision."
    On the same day, Lebanese opposition leader and several-time Foreign Minister Hamid Frangieh announced at a press conference that they would continue the struggle until the current Solh government resigned. He condemned "the ruling authorities as a gang of criminals."
    Meanwhile, Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt issued a statement supporting the "National Front's" demand that a transitional government be established to oversee the parliamentary elections.
    According to the Associated Press, the opposition fiercely opposes President Chamoun, who is considered pro-Western, and advocates for Frangieh to replace him.
    Former Prime Minister Salam, who was injured and arrested during the May 30th demonstration, continues his hunger strike to protest the government's arrest. He announced that he would continue his hunger strike until the current Solh government resigns.
    During the demonstration, the masses shouted "Down with Solh," "Down with Eisenhower," and "We support Nasser." Demonstrators even threw stones at the wife of a US military attaché.
    Opposition figures say that 340 people were arrested after the clashes between the demonstrating masses and government troops.

    据美联社报道，美国驻黎巴嫩、埃及、约旦、叙利亚的大使正在贝鲁特举行会谈。
    贝鲁特继5月30日的示威游行后，在5月31日又发生了反对党组织的示威。
    三千人聚集在一个清真寺倾听反对党领袖、前总理雅非发表的反对现政府的演说。雅非在演说中谴责政府在5月30日的游行中使无辜者流血。但是在参加大会的人还没有开始举行游行之前，政府的军队就开进了广场，把他们冲散。据合众社报道，有两人被警察打伤。
    索勒哈政府宣布，6月9日的议会选举仍将如期举行，“陆军将协助监督”。
    同一天，黎巴嫩反对党领袖、曾经几度担任外交部长的哈密德·弗朗吉在一个记者招待会上宣布，他们将继续斗争一直到目前的索勒哈政府辞职为止。他谴责“统治当局是一批罪恶分子”。
    同时，黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖朱姆布拉特发表声明支持“民族阵线”的要求，必需成立一个过渡政府来负责议会的选举事宜。
    据美联社报道，反对党激烈反对被认为亲西方的总统夏蒙，并且主张由弗朗吉来代替夏蒙。
    在5月30日示威游行时被打伤和逮捕的前总理萨拉姆还在继续绝食，抗议政府逮捕他。他并且宣布，他将一直绝食到目前的索勒哈政府辞职为止。
    在这次示威中，群众高呼“打倒索勒哈”，“打倒艾森豪威尔”，“我们支持纳赛尔”。示威的人曾经对一个美国武官的妻子投掷石块。
    反对党人士说，在示威群众同政府军警冲突后，共有三百四十人被捕。
