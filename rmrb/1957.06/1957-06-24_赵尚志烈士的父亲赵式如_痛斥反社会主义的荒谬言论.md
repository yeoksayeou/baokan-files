Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd. Zhao Shishuo, the 85-year-old father of Zhao Shangzhi, the hero of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, was extremely angered after seeing the recent speeches made by bourgeois rightists opposing socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party. He said angrily: In the past, I thought Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and others supported socialism, but now I know that they are a bunch of political careerists.

Zhao Shishuo asked: Didn't Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others see Chiang Kai-shek betraying the country during the Kuomintang era? Without the Communist Party, would we be able to resist the United States and aid Korea, and resist the powerful imperialist aggression?

Zhao Shishuo refuted Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party's World," believing that Chu Anping was lying through his teeth. In recent years, from the central government to the local level, haven't there been democratic figures serving as ministers and leaders? He said: The Communist Party's political program is to seek the interests of the people of the whole country and has won the support of the people. If we don't want the leadership of the Communist Party and don't want socialism, can anyone represent the entire people and come up with a political program that serves the interests of the vast number of workers and peasants? He finally expressed his determination to defend the socialist motherland that revolutionary martyrs exchanged for with their blood and heads.

    赵尚志烈士的父亲赵式如
    痛斥反社会主义的荒谬言论
    本报特约新华社哈尔滨23日电  东北抗日联军英雄赵尚志烈士的父亲，八十五岁的老人赵式如，看到资产阶级右派分子最近发表的反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的言论后十分震怒。他气愤地说：过去以为章伯钧、罗隆基等人是拥护社会主义的，现在才知道他们是一帮政治野心家。
    赵式如问道：章伯钧、罗隆基等人在国民党时代，难道没有见到蒋介石卖国吗？如果没有共产党，我们能够抗美援朝，抵抗强大的帝国主义侵略吗？
    赵式如驳斥了储安平的“党天下”谬论，他认为储安平是睁着眼睛说瞎话，这几年来从中央到地方，不是都有民主人士当部长，当领导吗？他说：共产党的政治纲领，都是为全国人民谋利益的，得到人民的拥护。不要共产党的领导，不要社会主义，难道有谁能够代表全体人民，拿出一个为广大工人、农民谋利益的政治纲领吗？他最后表示一定要保卫革命先烈用鲜血、头颅换来的社会主义祖国。
