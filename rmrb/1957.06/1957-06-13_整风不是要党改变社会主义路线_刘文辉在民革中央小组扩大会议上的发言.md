Rectification Is Not About the Party Changing the Socialist Line
Liu Wenhui's Speech at an Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

Amidst the enthusiastic development of the rectification movement, people from all walks of life across the country have pointed out many shortcomings in the work of some Communist Party members and offered many beneficial suggestions. However, at the same time, some remarks unfavorable to socialism and unity have emerged, and even despicable means of "threatening letters" have been adopted in an attempt to obstruct "contention" and undermine unity. The vast majority of people across the country can clearly see the errors or ulterior motives behind these things, and thus have issued righteous calls and given strong counter-criticism.

However, it cannot be assumed that everyone clearly understands some of the erroneous remarks, especially those who are deeply influenced by the old society are more likely to be confused by the shortcomings recently reported in the newspapers, and cannot see the guiding aspects of the revolution; they may even be suspicious of the current counter-criticism, thinking that it is "tightening up." These unclear understandings will be detrimental to future "airing" and "letting," to rectification, and to future unity. I would like to talk about my views on this aspect.

First of all, how should we view the shortcomings in the work of Communist Party members? The newspapers have revealed many shortcomings in various aspects, which are indeed numerous. At first glance, it is hard not to be surprised. But this is a concentrated exposure. If we think that these shortcomings are the accumulation of several years, the accumulation in the whole of China; and then think about the rapid development of our cause in these years, the heavy workload, then, what is so strange about these shortcomings? Moreover, if we think about the old society, which small corner was not filled with darkness? Today's shortcomings, compared to today's achievements, are like a little shadow under the sun. How can we deduce from these shortcomings that "the Chinese people no longer believe in the Communist Party," and that "over ninety percent of the Communist Party is engaged in sectarianism, even committing all kinds of evil"? These remarks have gone beyond the scope of making suggestions and are slandering!

I think two points should be clarified here: First, it is necessary to clarify that the purpose of the Communist Party's rectification is to correct shortcomings in its work and strengthen the unity between the Party and the masses, in order to benefit socialist construction. This purpose is in line with the interests of the 600 million people and the laws of social development, and is therefore selfless, just, and will certainly be achieved. The purpose of the democratic parties and the broad masses in helping the Communist Party to rectify is precisely because there are shortcomings in the work of some Communist Party members, and they want to help them correct them, to be the Communist Party's "loyal friends," not to ask the Party to change the socialist line. The history of China in the last hundred years proves that if the Chinese people want to get rid of the enslavement and oppression of imperialism, and build a prosperous and happy industrialized country, there is no other way to go except under the leadership of the working class vanguard—the Communist Party—to resolutely follow the socialist line. The historical facts before liberation proved that any other line is a dead end, and the facts after liberation proved how the socialist line is moving from victory to victory. In the face of these facts, even our most ferocious enemies—the imperialists—have to admit it. Therefore, our socialist line must not be changed in the slightest. When making suggestions, we should strictly distinguish that shortcomings and the line are two completely different things. Second, the object of rectification is not the Communist Party, but the "three majorisms" in the work of some party members. The "three majorisms" are not unique to Communist Party members, but are common problems. However, because the Communist Party is the leading party, its policies must be embodied by party members. Even if the smallest number of party members commit the "three majorisms," the harm to socialism is very serious. Therefore, the Party urgently needs rectification, and it needs non-Party people to help it with rectification. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and the "three majorisms" are the legacy of the old society. They are absolutely incompatible with the Communist Party, and they are absolutely incompatible with socialist construction. Therefore, to purify the vanguard of the working class, to strengthen the Party's leadership, and to complete socialist construction, we must rectify. Since the object of rectification is the "three majorisms," then what we want to overthrow is the "three majorisms," not the Communist Party; what we want to overthrow is the "three majorisms," not the socialist system. The socialist system was bought with the precious blood of many Communist Party members and many non-Party patriotic martyrs, and it has been consolidated by the hard work of the Party and all the people (including each of us present here) in recent years. If we even want to overthrow the socialist system, not to mention that the 600 million people will not agree, I ask, what have we been working so hard for these years? I am afraid it would be difficult to explain to ourselves, let alone be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs. In order to complete socialist construction, I ask: if we leave the strong leadership of the Communist Party, who else can we find to lead us? I think no one can answer this question. Then, why do some people say that "the three majorisms are the product of the proletarian dictatorship"? Say that "bureaucratism is more dangerous than capitalism"? Say that the Communist Party is "the Party's world"? Therefore, it can be concluded that these people are not starting from the interests of the whole people to overthrow the "three majorisms," but are standing on a hostile position, attempting to weaken the Communist Party's leadership, in order to sabotage the progress of socialist construction. Some absurd remarks are simply intolerable and should be given stern criticism.

Then, is the current counter-criticism "tightening up"? Or does it objectively hinder "contention"? I don't think so. It cannot be denied that in the process of the recently normally developing rectification movement, an unsatisfactory trend has emerged, which is that positive opinions are not allowed to be expressed. This is actually a single voice, not contention. The so-called "contention" must be that each person puts forward different opinions, and they learn from each other, so that the truth becomes clearer the more it is debated. And the one-sided voice of the opposite opinion can never achieve such a goal. Therefore, except for a few people who only allow the one-sided voice of the opposite opinion, the general public will never think that putting forward counter-criticism is "tightening up," and will hinder "contention." At the same time, I believe that helping rectification is not only pointing out the shortcomings of the Communist Party so that they can be corrected, which can benefit socialist construction. Moreover, through mutual criticism, we can recognize the truth, gradually improve ourselves, and achieve the effect of ideological reform. On the basis of improving ideological understanding and consistency, we can achieve further unity.

I believe that after this counter-criticism, "airing" and "letting" starting from the desire for unity will continue to develop normally; after this rectification, the three majorisms will definitely be greatly reduced; and with the people of the whole country having a more consistent ideological understanding, they will be more closely united; and the progress of our socialist construction will achieve a faster speed.

　　整风不是要党改变社会主义路线
　　刘文辉在民革中央小组扩大会议上的发言
    在整风运动的热烈开展中，全国各界人士，对部分共产党员，指出许多工作中的缺点，提出许多有益的建议。但与此同时，也出现了些不利于社会主义，不利于团结的言论，甚至有采取“恐吓信”的卑鄙手段，企图阻碍“争鸣”，破坏团结。对于这些，全国绝大多数的人，都能清楚地看出它的错误或别有用心，从而发出正义的呼声，给予了有力的反批评。
    但是，不能认为，所有的人对一些错误言论都已经认识得很清楚，尤其是受旧社会影响较深的人，更容易为最近各报所载的缺点所迷惑，看不见革命的主导方面；甚至对目前的反批评发生怀疑，以为在“收”，这些不清楚的认识，将不利今后的“鸣”、“放”，不利于整风，不利于今后的团结。我想就这方面谈谈我的看法。
    首先，如何看待共产党员工作中的缺点。报纸上揭露出各方面的缺点，确是不少，初听乍看之下，难免吃惊。但这是集中的揭露。如果我们想到这些缺点是几年来的积累，是全中国范围的积累；再想到这几年我们事业发展的迅速，工作的繁重，那末，这些缺点有什么可怪？更想到旧社会，哪一个小角落不是充满了黑暗？今天这种缺点，比之今天的成绩，正如太阳下面的一点阴影，怎样能够从这些缺点里面引伸出“中国人民已经不相信共产党”、“共产党百分之九十几都在闹宗派，甚至无恶不作”？这些言论，已经超出了提意见的范围，而是在进行污蔑！
    我认为在这里应当明确两点：第一，要明确共产党整风的目的，是改正工作中的缺点，加强党群之间的团结，以利于社会主义的建设。这个目的，既符合六亿人民的利益，又符合社会发展的规律，因而是无私的、正义的，并且一定能够实现的。各民主党派和广大群众帮助共产党整风的目的，也正因为部分共产党员工作中存在着缺点，要帮助他们改正，作共产党的“诤友”，而不是要党改变社会主义的路线。中国近百年来的历史证明，中国人民要摆脱帝国主义的奴役和压迫，要建设富强康乐的工业化国家，除了由工人阶级先锋队——共产党，领导全体人民坚决走社会主义路线以外，决没有第二条路线可走。解放前的历史事实证明了任何别的路线都是死路，解放后的事实证明了社会主义的路线是怎样地从胜利走向胜利。在这些事实面前，就是我们最凶狠的敌人——帝国主义者也不得不承认。因而，我们的社会主义的路线决不能有丝毫改变，提意见时，应严格分清：缺点问题和路线问题是截然不同的两回事。第二，整风的对象不是共产党，而是部分党员工作中的“三大主义”，“三大主义”不是共产党员才有，而是普遍存在的毛病。不过，因为共产党是领导党，它的政策要通过党员体现出来，党员中即使是最少数人犯了“三大主义”的毛病，对于社会主义的害处，都很严重，所以，党才急需整风，而且要党外人士帮助它整风。共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，而“三大主义”则是旧社会的遗留物，它和共产党是绝对不相容的，它和社会主义建设也是绝对不相容的，所以，要纯洁工人阶级先锋队，要加强党的领导，要完成社会主义建设，必须整风。整风的对象既然是“三大主义”，那末，要打倒的是“三大主义”而不是共产党，要打倒的是“三大主义”而不是社会主义制度。社会主义制度是好多共产党和好多非党的爱国先烈，用宝贵的鲜血换取得来的，也是近年党和全体人民（包括我们在座的每一个人在内）用辛勤的努力巩固起来的，如果连社会主义制度也要打倒，不说六亿人民不答应，试问我们这些年来每天紧张的工作，究竟为了什么？恐怕也很难于自解，更不用说对不起革命先烈了。为要完成社会主义建设，试问：离开共产党的坚强领导，我们又找谁来领导？我想没有人能够回答这个问题。那末，为什么有人会说：“三大主义是无产阶级专政的产物”？说：“官僚主义比资本主义更危险”？说共产党是“党天下”？所以，可以得出结论：这些人不是从全体人民的利益出发来打倒“三大主义”，而是站在敌对的立场，企图削弱共产党的领导，来破坏社会主义建设的进展。有些荒谬言论，简直令人难于容忍，应当给予严正的批评。
    那末，目前这种反批评是不是“收”？或者客观上是不是妨碍“争鸣”？我认为不是。不能否认，最近在正常开展的整风运动过程中，出现了一种不能令人满意的歪风，这就是不许发表正面的意见。这实际上是独鸣，而不是争鸣了。所谓“争”，一定是各人提出不同的意见，互相切磋，使得真理愈辩愈明。而反面意见的一家独鸣，却决不能达到这样的目的。因此，对于这个问题，除了少数只许反面意见一家独鸣的人之外，一般决不会以为提出反批评就是要“收”，就会妨碍“争鸣”。同时，我认为：帮助整风的人，不仅是指出共产党的缺点，使其改正，可以有利于社会主义的建设。而且，还可以通过互相批评，认识真理，使自己逐步提高，收到思想改造的效果。在提高思想认识一致的基础上，达到进一步的团结。
    我相信：经过这次反批评以后，从团结愿望出发的“鸣”、“放”，将正常地继续开展；在这次整风后，三大主义必定大大减少；全国人民在思想认识更加一致下，将团结得更紧密；我们的社会主义建设的进展，将获得更快的速度。
