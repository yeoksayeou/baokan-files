    At the reception, Chairman Liu Shaoqi raised his glass and said, "I wish the close friendship between China and Pakistan will grow and develop day by day, and I wish the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and its people will become increasingly prosperous economically and culturally. I wish President Iskander Mirza good health." He also expressed a warm welcome to the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation's visit to China.
