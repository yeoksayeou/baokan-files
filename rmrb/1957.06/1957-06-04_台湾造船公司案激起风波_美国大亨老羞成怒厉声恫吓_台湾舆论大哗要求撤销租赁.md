Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 3rd: The incident of the American consortium swallowing up the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation through fraudulent means has led to Taiwan newspapers and people from all walks of life demanding that the Taiwan authorities revoke the approval of the "lease" of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation to the Americans.

Recently, Chang Chi-peng, a "Legislative Yuan member" of the Taiwan Kuomintang, pointed out that the so-called "cooperation" between the United States and Taiwan in shipbuilding is "a big scam," and there is "no sign of foreign investment at all." He also pointed out that based on the American method of "borrowing" funds from the Taiwan authorities to build ships, the borrowed funds may "never be recovered!" "Legislative Yuan member" Guo Deng-ao denounced the ugly means used by the Americans to "lease" the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation, saying that the likes of the American Grigorson, chairman of "Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding Dockyard Corporation," are either "liars or scalpers!"

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 3rd: After the ugly inside story of the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Company's takeover of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation was revealed, the Americans, in their humiliation, have recently been exerting extreme threats and intimidation against the Taiwan authorities.

According to Taiwan newspapers, the American "investors" stated that if the Kuomintang "Legislative Yuan" does not quickly pass the so-called US-Taiwan "cooperation" shipbuilding bill, they will withdraw the "cooperation" method and make "compensation" claims against the Taiwan authorities. Grigorson, the chairman of the so-called "China International Foundation" organized by Americans and current chairman of "Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding Dockyard Corporation," also issued a statement threatening the Taiwan authorities, saying that if the situation continues, "the opportunity to invite American private investment will no longer exist," and threatened to "resort to judicial steps." He also said that the Taiwan Kuomintang "Legislative Yuan members" who exposed this "cooperation" scam are "suspected of echoing communist elements."

The threats and intimidation from the American tycoon have aroused great indignation from all parties in Taiwan. Guo Deng-ao and other sixteen Kuomintang "Legislative Yuan members" immediately protested, stating that the Americans should not be allowed to interfere with the exercise of power by the Taiwan authorities. The conveners of the Finance and Economic Committees of the "Control Yuan" also issued a statement, denouncing Grigorson's statement as "bordering on coercion." Even the Kuomintang "Minister of Economic Affairs," Jiang Piao, also criticized Grigorson's statement as disrespectful to the Taiwan "government" and "Legislative Yuan members." Many Taiwan newspapers also published editorials or reader letters, criticizing the American tycoon's insulting and threatening remarks.

    台湾造船公司案激起风波
    美国大亨老羞成怒厉声恫吓  台湾舆论大哗要求撤销租赁
    据新华社广州3日电　美国财团用欺诈手段吞并台湾造船公司的事件发生后，台湾报纸和社会人士纷纷要求台湾当局撤销对美国人“租赁”台湾造船公司的认许。
    最近，台湾国民党“立法委员”张其彭指出，所谓美国和台湾“合作”造船实系“一大骗局”，根本“看不出外人投资的迹象”。他还指出，按美国人现在向台湾当局“借”款造船的这套办法，恐怕借出去的资金也“永无收回希望！”“立法委员”郭登敖指斥美国人“租赁”台湾造船公司那一套丑恶的手腕时说，“英加尔斯台湾造船船坞公司”董事长美国人葛利格生之流如果“不是骗子，就是黄牛！”
    新华社广州3日电　美国英加尔斯造船公司吞并台湾造船公司的丑恶内幕被揭露后，美国人老羞成怒，最近对台湾当局极力加以威胁和恫吓。
    据台湾报纸报道，美方“投资人”表示，国民党“立法院”要是再不快快通过所谓美台“合作”造船法案，他们就要撤销此项“合作”办法，并且将向台湾当局提出“赔偿”要求。美国人组织的所谓“中国国际基金会”的主席、现“英加尔斯台湾造船船坞公司”董事长葛利格生也发表声明恐吓台湾当局，说再闹下去就“邀请美国私人投资的机会将不复再有”，并以要“诉诸司法步骤”相要挟。他还说揭露这宗“合作”骗局的台湾国民党“立法委员”有“附和共党分子之嫌”。
    美国大亨所施的威胁恫吓，激起台湾各方极大的愤慨。国民党“立法委员”郭登敖等十六人立即提出抗议，表示不容美国人干预台湾当局的行使权。“监察院”的财、经两委员会召集人也发表声明，指斥葛利格生的声明“迹近要挟”。连国民党“经济部长”江?，也斥葛利格生的声明对台湾“政府”和“立法委员”失敬。台湾不少报纸也发表社论或读者来信，对美国大亨的侮辱和威胁言论加以抨击。
