Xinhua News Agency, London, June 5th. British Prime Minister Macmillan, in response to the Labour Party's questioning of the government's hydrogen bomb policy in the House of Commons on June 4th, once again firmly rejected even a temporary suspension of hydrogen bomb testing.

At the time, Labour Party leader Gaitskell asked whether the government would be willing to halt testing, given that Britain had detonated its second hydrogen bomb the previous Friday. The Prime Minister said, "We have put forward our suggestions for methods of limiting or supervising these tests," "We stand by these suggestions."

Labour MP Bevan demanded an international agreement be reached to stop further testing before other countries began conducting hydrogen bomb tests. He accused the government of evading the issue, as the government's proposal only called for registering tests, not stopping them.

While Bevan was speaking, Conservative MPs repeatedly shouted in an attempt to stop him, while Labour MPs loudly supported Bevan. Order was temporarily disrupted.

Macmillan rejected Bevan's demands. He said he did not intend to put the country in an "inferior position at a time when tests which will place Britain in a very good position are nearing completion." At the same time, he said that Britain "hopes and intends to see disarmament—including nuclear disarmament—begin to be implemented."

He also denied that Britain's tests would cause harm. He said the particles produced by Britain's tests were "negligible."

While the House of Commons was in session, women dressed in black petitioned MPs outside to oppose hydrogen bomb testing.

Thirteen women took a petition with two thousand signatures to 10 Downing Street, pointing out that their descendants would suffer from the harm caused by nuclear testing.

    英工党抨击政府的氢弹政策
    麦克米伦认为暂时停止试验也不可能
    新华社伦敦5日电　英国首相麦克米伦6月4日在下院答复工党对政府氢弹政策的时候，再度坚决拒绝甚至是暂时停止氢弹试验。
    当时，工党领袖盖次克尔追问，英国既然已经在上星期五爆炸了它的第二个氢弹，政府是否愿意停止试验。首相说：“我们已经为限制或监督这些试验的方法提出了我们的建议”，“我们坚持这些建议”。
    工党议员比万要求在其他一些国家开始进行氢弹试验以前就达成国际协议，以便停止继续进行试验。他指责政府回避问题，因为政府建议的只是要登记试验而不是停止试验。
    比万发言的时候保守党议员不时大叫大喊，企图阻止他讲下去，工党议员则大声支持比万。一时秩序大乱。
    麦克米伦拒绝了比万的要求。他说，他不打算在使英国“处于很好的地位的试验快要完成的时候，使这个国家处于低劣的地位”。同时，他又说，英国“希望和打算看到裁军——包括原子核武器的裁军——能够开始实行”。
    他还否认英国的试验会造成危害。他说，英国的试验所产生的微粒是“微不足道的”。
    在下院举行会议的时候，穿黑衣服的妇女在外面向议员请愿，反对氢弹试验。
    十三名妇女拿着有两千人签名的请愿书到唐宁街十号去，这封请愿书指出，她们的后代将遭受到核试验造成的危害。
