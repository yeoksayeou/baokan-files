Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions received a telegram today from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Mountaineering Team from Gongga Mountain in central Sichuan Province. The telegram stated that the team leader, Shi Zhanchun, and five other team members successfully reached the summit of this 7,590-meter-high mountain on the 13th.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Mountaineering Team conquered this high mountain after only a little over a month of preparation. On the 13th, the weather was favorable. Shi Zhanchun and the five others launched their assault on the summit from a location between 6,600 and 6,800 meters above sea level at six o'clock in the morning, safely reaching the peak at one o'clock in the afternoon. The other five who reached the summit were: Shi Xiu, Peng Zhongmu, Liu Lianman, Guo Decun, and Liu Dayi.

Gongga Mountain stands tall on the plateau in the eastern part of the Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province and is forty-four meters higher than Muztagh Ata, which was climbed by the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team last year. Local Tibetans call Gongga Mountain the "King of Mountains." This mountain is composed of granite, metamorphic rocks, and other igneous rocks, as well as some sedimentary rocks. The Swiss scientist Heim, who explored this mountain, considered it the largest granite batholith on Earth. Everywhere on the mountain, there are steep cliffs and precipices, and many steep places cannot even retain ice and snow. Beneath the thick ice and snow lie treacherous glacial crevasses, and countless glaciers flow. The largest glaciers are five in number, among which the Hailuogou Glacier is more than ten kilometers long. The enormous glacial moraines on the glacier resemble towering stone walls, blocking the way. When people gaze at this snow-capped peak, they often see clouds of mist rising from the mountains. This is a snow avalanche, which carries thousands of tons of ice and snow as it cascades down. The roar of tumbling rocks and avalanches can be heard clearly from twenty or thirty *li* away.

This magical snow mountain was recorded in a Tibetan chronicle as early as the Tang Dynasty in our country. It is said that the famous Chinese traveler Xu Xiake was the first to write about it in Chinese records. About four hundred years ago, Xu Xiake, gazing from afar at this majestic snow mountain from Mount Emei in Sichuan Province, resolutely decided to travel there. In 1928, the American explorer Joseph Rock came here to explore, which then attracted the attention of people from all over the world.

Local Tibetans regard this "sacred mountain" as a symbol of the most beautiful things. They have composed many songs about Gongga Mountain. One goes like this: "I ride a horse as fine as Gongga Mountain, with a bit like the Big Dipper, and a saddle like the sun and moon. I will travel around the world, to see all kinds of new and wonderful things." When the mountaineering team first arrived at the foot of the mountain, the local Tibetans enthusiastically hoped that they would retrieve a golden bar said to be hidden on the summit. This is naturally just an interesting legend. However, these mountaineering team members have opened a new chapter in the history of mountaineering in the motherland and have won glory for the people of the motherland that cannot be exchanged even for gold.

### 我国爬山队员登上“山中之王”  这座贡嘎山比穆士塔格山还高四十四公尺

　　我国爬山队员登上“山中之王”
    这座贡嘎山比穆士塔格山还高四十四公尺
    据新华社16日讯　中华全国总工会今天收到中华全国总工会爬山队从四川省中部的贡嘎山发来的电报，电报中说，爬山队队长史占春和队员共六人已经在13日登上这个拔海七千五百九十公尺高的山的顶峰。
    中华全国总工会爬山队只经过一个多月的准备，就征服了这座高山。13日天气良好，史占春等六人早晨六点钟从拔海六千六百到六千八百公尺的地方向顶峰突击，下午一点钟安全抵达顶峰。登上顶峰的其他五人是：师秀、彭忠穆、刘连满、国德存、刘大义。
    贡嘎山矗立在四川省甘孜藏族自治州东部的高原上，比中苏混合爬山队去年攀登的穆士塔格山高四十四公尺。当地藏族人民把贡嘎山称作“山中之王”。这座山是由花岗岩、变质岩等火成岩和部分水成岩构成的。曾到这座山考察的瑞士科学家哈姆认为它是地球上最大的花岗圆体。山上到处是峭岩绝壁，许多陡峭的地方连冰雪也无法积留。在深厚的冰雪下，隐藏着险恶的雪山裂缝，还流泻着难以数计的冰河。最大的冰河有五条，其中海螺沟冰河长达十多公里。冰河上巨大的冰积石，像一座座高大石壁，阻挡在人们面前。当人们伫望着这座雪峰时，往往会看见山间腾起团团云雾的景象。这就是雪崩，它挟着成千上万吨的冰雪倾泻下来。滚石和雪崩的轰响，二、三十里以外也清晰可闻。
    这座神奇的雪山早在我国唐代的一部西藏编年史里，就有记载。最早把它写入汉文志的据说就是我国著名旅行家徐霞客。大约在四百年以前，徐霞客在四川省峨眉山上遥遥望见西方这座巍然高耸的雪山，就毅然决定前去游历。1928年，美国探险家骆克来这里探险后，才引起世界各国人士注意。
    当地藏族人民把这座“神山”看作是最美好的事物的象征。他们编出许多关于贡嘎山的歌谣。有一首是这样的：“我骑着一匹像贡嘎山样骏马，配上像北斗星一样的马嚼口，像太阳月亮一样的鞍鞯。我要围着世界转一周，把各种新奇事物看一看。”这次爬山队员初到山下时，当地藏族人民曾满怀热情地希望他们取下据说是藏在山顶的一根黄金棒子。这自然只是一个有趣的传说。但是，这些爬山队员们在祖国爬山运动史上揭开了新的一页，给祖国人民争得了用黄金也换不来的荣誉。
