Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao Kingdom Assembly issued a communique on June 4th, expressing regret over the resignation of Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma. The communique also stated that regarding the formation of a new cabinet, the Kingdom Assembly believes that the new Prime Minister should have prestige and be trusted among all political parties, especially the members of parliament, so that he can obtain a sufficient majority without bargaining, in order to successfully complete the important task assigned to him.

The Kingdom Assembly issued its opinion on the cabinet crisis and the formation of a new cabinet at the call of the King's supreme representative, the Crown Prince. Phouma resigned on May 30th after the National Assembly expressed disapproval of the government's two proposals concerning the Lao combat forces. On June 3rd, the King appointed National Party Chairman Sasorith to form a cabinet. According to Agence France-Presse, well-informed sources in Vientiane revealed on June 4th that Sasorith's approach is to form a coalition government based on the National Party, with the participation of the Independent Party and the Democratic Party. However, predictions about whether Sasorith has the opportunity to form a coalition government and obtain authorization from the National Assembly are "very reserved."

The Kingdom Assembly said in the communique that the National Assembly's vote indicating that it did not believe that the government and the Lao combat forces had effectively implemented their agreement and joint statement should not mean that the National Assembly disagreed with the government's actions, because the government cannot be held responsible for the failure to implement the agreement, "because the Lao combat forces are always making new demands."

The communique said that the National Assembly may be expressing its dissatisfaction with the procedures for implementing these agreements, and everyone hopes that these agreements will truly achieve the unification of Laos. The Kingdom Assembly believes that the National Assembly may be unwilling for the Lao combat forces to negotiate equally with the Kingdom government in a position like "representatives of another country," and hopes that these agreements will be achieved through "another reasonable and constitutional procedure," namely: restoring the Kingdom's administration and redeploying Kingdom troops in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, incorporating the cadres of the Lao combat forces into the Kingdom's administration and army, allowing the Lao combat forces to become a political party recognized by the country's legitimate authorities—the "Lao Patriotic Front"—and then participate in the coalition government and possess all the political rights of Lao citizens.

The Kingdom Assembly requires the new Prime Minister to have a "very clear action program" passed by the National Assembly, pre-requesting the National Assembly to delineate the limits of possible concessions to the Lao combat forces, and that agreements reached with the Lao combat forces on certain issues should be approved by the National Assembly before continuing negotiations on new disputed issues.

The communique concluded that when the limit of concessions delineated by the National Assembly is reached, negotiations with the Lao combat forces should be considered interrupted, and the Kingdom government should report to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference and submit it to the United Nations "in order to condemn foreign interference, which is still the only reason for the Lao combat forces to make demands (to the government)."

### 老挝王国会议就国内政局表示意见  要求新首相同寮方谈判须受国民议会约制

    老挝王国会议就国内政局表示意见
    要求新首相同寮方谈判须受国民议会约制
    据新华社河内7日电　万象消息：老挝王国会议6月4日发表公报，对首相富马亲王的辞职表示遗憾。公报并且说，关于成立新内阁的问题，王国会议认为，新首相应该在各政党特别是议员中有威望和获得信任，使他能够不必讨价还价就可以取得足够的多数，以便顺利完成所给予的重任。
    王国会议是应国王的最高代表王太子的呼吁，就内阁危机和成立新内阁的问题而发表意见的。富马是在5月30日在国民议会对政府提出的两个有关寮国战斗部队的问题表示不赞成以后提出辞职。6月3日，国王委任国家党主席萨索里特组阁。据法新社透露，万象一般消息灵通人士6月4日透露，萨索里特的方针是组织以国家党为基础、有独立党和民主党参加的联合政府。但是，对于萨索里特有无实现联合政府并且在国民议会获得授权机会这一点，预言是“十分保留”的。
    王国会议在公报中说，国民议会在投票中表示不认为富马政府和寮国战斗部队双方执行它们的协议和联合声明已经获得成效，这不应意味着国民议会不同意政府的行为，因为政府对于未能执行协议不能负责，“因为寮国战斗部队老是提出新的要求”。
    公报说，国民议会可能是要表示它对实现这些协议的程序的不满，而大家希望通过这些协议真正实现老挝的统一。王国会议认为，可能是国民议会不愿意寮国战斗部队打算以像“另一个国家的代表”那样的地位，来同王国政府平等谈判，而希望这些协议要通过“合理的、合乎宪法的另一种程序”来实现，即：在桑怒和丰沙里两省恢复王国的政权和重驻王国军队，把寮国战斗部队的干部并入王国的政权和军队之中，准许寮国战斗部队成为一个为国家的合法当局所承认的政党——“老挝爱国阵线”，然后参加联合政府，并且拥有一切老挝公民的政治权利。
    王国会议要求新首相应有为国民议会所通过的“非常明确的行动纲领”，预先要求国民议会划出可能向寮国战斗部队让步的界限，同寮国战斗部队就一定的问题达成的协议应该得到国民议会的批准，然后才就新的争执问题继续谈判。
    公报最后说，在达到国民议会划定的让步界限的时候，同寮国战斗部队的谈判就应该被认为中断，王国政府应该报告日内瓦会议两主席，并且提交联合国，“以便谴责外国的干涉，这种干涉至今仍成为寮国战斗部队（向政府）提出要求的唯一原因”。
