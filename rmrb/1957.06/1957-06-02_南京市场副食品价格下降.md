Market Inspection

    Nanjing market's non-staple food prices have dropped.
    After the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee vigorously adopted measures to strengthen market management, the supply of vegetables, aquatic products, and food has improved in the city recently, and the prices of live fish and fresh vegetables have generally decreased. This is one example of the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee's earnest improvement of its work during the rectification campaign.
    A week ago, the price of non-staple foods in Nanjing once rose, with a pound of green vegetables costing as much as eight or nine cents, causing widespread dissatisfaction among residents. After the Municipal People's Committee discovered this situation, it actively took measures. Deputy Mayor Xu Bu personally grasped the market supply situation every day. In addition to sending people to other places to organize sources of goods, the Vegetable Company also sold vegetables on the market through cooperative groups on a commission basis. By May 28, the price of green vegetables had dropped to two or three cents per pound. The prices of broad bean kernels, chives, live fish, and prawns also fell, and the price of shad dropped from more than one yuan per pound to fifty cents.
    At present, Nanjing's market management work has also been significantly strengthened. Gulou District convened a meeting of more than 160 inspectors, launched inspections starting from May 25, established reporting and reception rooms for illegal activities in six large vegetable markets, added scale calibration points in seven small vegetable markets, and urged all vendors in the district to clearly mark prices. Districts have successively held meetings of street office directors to mobilize residents to assist in supervision. Some illegal phenomena have also begun to be dealt with. The problem of the specifications of fried dough sticks and sesame cakes, which had not been resolved for a long time, has now begun to improve. The sesame cakes have been enlarged, and the amount of flour for every ten fried dough sticks has increased from six liang to eight liang, and the concentration of soybean milk has increased from four or five degrees to fourteen degrees.

    南京市场副食品价格下降
    南京市人民委员会，在大力采取措施、加强市场管理后，近日来市内蔬菜、水产、饮食的供应情况已有好转，活鱼，鲜菜价格普遍下降。这是南京市人民委员会在整风中切实改进工作的一例。
    在一星期以前，南京副食品价格曾经一度上涨，一斤青菜竟要八分、九分，居民普遍表示不满。市人民委员会发现这一情况后，积极采取了措施。副市长徐步，每天具体掌握市场供应情况；蔬菜公司除派人到外地组织货源外，并以委托合作组代销方式在市场上抛售，到5月28日，青菜每斤的价格已下降到三分、二分；蚕豆米、韭菜、活鱼、大虾价格也有下跌，鲥鱼每斤已从一元多下降到五角。
    目前，南京市的市场管理工作也已显著加强。鼓楼区召开了一百六十多人的检查人员会议，从5月25日起出动检查，并在六个大菜场建立了检举违法接待室，在七个小菜场添设校秤处，还督促全区商贩都明码标价。各区先后都召开街道办事处主任会议，发动居民群众协助监督。有些违法现象，亦已开始进行处理。长期没有得到解决的油条、烧饼的规格问题，现在已开始有了改进，烧饼已经放大，油条每十根亦由六两面增加到八两，豆浆浓度由四、五度增加到十四度。
