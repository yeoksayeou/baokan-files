    印度尼西亚报纸评论
    中国印度尼西亚足球赛
    新华社雅加达3日电　今天印度尼西亚各报都以头条地位登载了中国和印度尼西亚两国足球赛的消息和印度尼西亚国家足球队领队科沙西·普瓦内加拉的广播演讲，有些报纸还评论了胜败的原因。
    “独立报”认为，中国队显然已经从雅加达那场比赛中学习了很多东西。中国队突然快速进攻的方法很聪明，给了印度尼西亚队以重大的威胁和压力。中国队的胜利是值得尊重的。这家报纸说，印度尼西亚队能够作全力的反抗，一度赶成了三平的局面，是令人惊异的，最后虽然失败也是值得尊重的。
    “人民日报”说，值得敬佩的是中国队采用了新战术。他们很快地从失败中学得了经验。他们通过翼锋从边线前进，就迫使印度尼西亚队的防线扩大而难于防守。
    6月2日下午球赛进行的时候，印度尼西亚各地有收音机的商店、旅馆、住宅都收听了球赛的实况广播。印度尼西亚人民一直重视和关心着这场球赛。
