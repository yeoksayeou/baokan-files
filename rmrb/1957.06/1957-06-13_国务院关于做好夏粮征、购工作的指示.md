　　State Council Directive on Doing a Good Job in the Summer Grain Collection and Purchase
    The summer harvest of new grains (including wheat, buckwheat, barley, broad beans, peas, early rice, etc.) is about to begin successively in various regions. Doing a good job in the summer grain collection and purchase is an important task in the rural areas at present. For this reason, the following instructions are issued:
    1.  The summer grain collection and purchase tasks of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should be promptly assigned to agricultural production cooperatives (households). The amount of the state summer grain collection and purchase tasks completed by the agricultural production cooperatives (households) is a part of the total state grain collection and purchase tasks that should be completed for the year, and will be combined and settled uniformly during the autumn grain collection and purchase.
    2.  The summer grain collection and purchase work must be closely integrated with the internal summer harvest distribution work of the agricultural production cooperatives. In the summer harvest distribution work, agricultural production cooperatives should allocate grain according to the grain distribution sequence stipulated in the "Instructions on Current Grain Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on November 21, 1956, namely: agricultural production cooperatives should first reserve sufficient seeds according to actual needs; ensure the completion of the state's summer grain collection and purchase tasks; and reserve rations for members according to the grain consumption standards stipulated in the "Three Fixes" for grain (and fodder where livestock feed needs to be reserved). The calculation of the consumption time for summer grain reserved by members should generally be based on the principle of being able to connect with the autumn harvest; in areas where the summer grain output accounts for a large proportion of the annual grain output, the calculation of the consumption time for reserved summer grain can be appropriately extended; the specific grain consumption time and the amount of grain reserved shall be determined by the people's committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. Agricultural production cooperatives with surplus grain, after completing the state's collection and purchase tasks and reserving seeds, feed, and rations for members, may freely dispose of the remaining grain. At this time, members who are strong in labor and have put in more work can be given consideration. Since the autumn harvest situation is uncertain, agricultural production cooperatives must make annual arrangements when distributing summer grain, and pay attention to thrift, preventing both waste and large disparities in the amount of grain distributed among members.
    In order to appropriately take care of the needs of the masses for grain variety adjustments, local grain authorities may purchase a portion of grain from the masses in exchange for other grains, depending on the possibilities of the state's inventory; in areas where they are unable to take care of these needs due to limited capacity, they should also explain the situation clearly to the masses.
    3.  During last year's summer harvest, some areas lacked experience and did not integrate the harvesting, threshing, distribution, and collection and purchase work well, resulting in many problems, which not only caused serious losses to summer harvest crops, but also affected the completion of the state's summer grain collection and purchase tasks. Therefore, this year, agricultural production cooperatives should, in the process of the summer harvest, pay grain to the state and sell unified purchase grain in a planned way, completing the summer grain collection and purchase tasks; and at the same time, distribute the rations that should be distributed to the members in a timely manner. It is necessary to prevent losses and waste caused by poor organization of harvesting and distribution work. State grain departments should send inspection personnel to agricultural production cooperatives as soon as possible to help agricultural production cooperatives inspect grain quality on the spot and correctly implement the policy of pricing according to quality. And it is necessary to carefully do a good job in the inspection, purchase and storage of fine seeds.
    4.  The summer grain collection and purchase work must be closely integrated with the summer rural grain unified sales work and carried out simultaneously. The practical experience of the past few years has proved that in summer grain concentrated production areas, after the summer grain is harvested and before the autumn grain is harvested, the rural areas basically do not need the state to supply grain; for a small number of agricultural production cooperatives (households) that lack grain, the amount of grain that needs to be supplied by the state during the period of connecting with the autumn new grain should be verified according to the actual situation of summer grain production and harvest, and according to the various grain consumption standards stipulated in the "Three Fixes", and supplied according to the principle of "supply when grain is lacking."
    5.  During the summer grain unified purchase period, it is necessary to strengthen the management of the state grain market. Grain varieties that are subject to state unified purchase shall not be traded on the market before the end of the unified purchase; after the end of the unified purchase, the end of the unified purchase should be announced on a county basis, allowing the masses to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and exchange varieties among themselves. At the same time, it must be explained to agricultural production cooperatives, members, and individual farmers that they are not allowed to sell or transfer grain intended for rations, feed, and seeds on the market, and then ask the state to supply grain. Illegal activities such as speculation and profiteering in grain must be strictly prohibited.
    6.  Strengthen political and ideological education and policy publicity. On the one hand, it should be explained to grassroots cadres the reason why the state must collect and purchase grain from farmers and the obligation of farmers to sell grain to the state, and specifically explain the policy boundaries and working methods, so that they can fully understand the importance of the state's summer grain collection and purchase work, learn from the experience and lessons of last year's summer grain collection and purchase work, conscientiously overcome subjective and one-sided thinking methods and working methods, and strive to complete the summer grain collection and purchase tasks on the basis of correctly implementing the policies. On the other hand, the cadres and members of the broad masses of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers should be educated to fully recognize the consistency of saving grain with the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, so that they can actively and consciously achieve careful harvesting and threshing, returning every grain to the home, and drying and cleaning the grain, and completing the state's summer grain collection and purchase tasks.

　　国务院关于做好夏粮征、购工作的指示
    各地夏收新粮（包括小麦、元麦、大麦、蚕豆、豌豆、早稻等）即将陆续登场，做好夏粮征、购工作，是当前农村中的一项重要工作。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、各省、自治区、直辖市的夏粮征、购任务应该及时下达到农业生产合作社（户），农业生产合作社（户）完成国家夏粮征购的任务数，为全年应该完成的国家粮食征购任务的一部分，在秋粮征购时统一合并结算。
    二、夏粮征、购工作必须同农业生产合作社内部的夏收分配工作密切结合进行。农业生产合作社在夏收分配工作中，对粮食的分配，应该按照中共中央、国务院1956年11月21日关于当前粮食工作的指示中规定的粮食分配顺序，即：农业生产合作社先按实际需要留足种籽；保证完成国家的夏粮征购任务；按照粮食“三定”时规定的用粮标准，留给社员口粮（需要留牲畜饲料的地方并留饲料）。计算社员留用夏粮的消费时间，一般以能接上秋熟为原则；夏粮产量占全年粮食产量比重较大的地方，计算留用夏粮的时间可以适当放长一点；具体留粮消费时间和留粮数量，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定。凡是有余粮的农业生产合作社，在完成国家的征购任务、留下种籽饲料和社员口粮以后，仍有余粮的，由农业生产合作社自由处理，在这个时候，可以对劳动强和出工多的社员给以照顾。由于秋季年景未定，农业生产合作社在进行夏粮分配的时候，必须作全年安排，并且要注意节约，既要防止浪费，又要防止社员之间分粮数量悬殊。
    为了适当照顾群众粮食品种调剂的需要，各地粮食机关可以根据国家库存力量的可能，向群众换购一部分粮食；在限于力量而不能照顾的地方，也应该向群众解释清楚。
    三、在去年夏收当中，有些地方因缺乏经验，收割、打场、分配和征购工作结合得不好，以致发生很多问题，不仅造成了夏收作物的严重损失，还影响了国家的夏粮征购任务的完成。因此，今年农业生产合作社在夏收过程中，应该有计划地一面向国家缴纳公粮和交售统购粮，完成夏粮征、购任务；一面把应该分配给社员的口粮及时分到社员手里。必须防止由于收获和分配工作组织的不好而造成损失和浪费。国家粮食部门应该尽可能地及时派出检验人员深入到农业生产合作社，就地帮助农业生产合作社检验粮食质量，正确贯彻执行依质论价的政策。并且要认真做好优良种籽的检验、收购和保管的工作。
    四、夏粮征、购工作必须与夏季农村粮食统销工作密切结合进行，同时做好。过去几年的实际经验证明，夏粮集中产区在夏粮登场以后，秋粮登场以前，农村基本上不需要国家供应粮食；对于少数缺粮的农业生产合作社（户），应该根据夏季粮食生产收获的实际情况，按照“三定”时规定的各项用粮标准，核定其接上秋季新粮期间须由国家供应的粮食数量，按照“何时缺粮何时供应”的原则进行供应。
    五、在夏粮统购期间，必须加强国家粮食市场的管理工作。凡属国家统购粮食的品种，在统购结束以前不得在市场进行交易；统购结束以后，应该以县为单位宣布统购结束，允许群众相互之间进行有无调剂和品种交换。与此同时，必须向农业生产合作社、社员和个体农户说明，不许以口粮、饲料和种籽用粮去市场出卖或者移作他用，以后又向国家要求供应粮食。对于以粮食进行投机买卖，从中牟利的非法行为，必须严格制止。
    六、加强政治思想教育和政策宣传工作。一方面，应该向基层干部说明国家必须向农民征购粮食和农民有义务交售粮食的道理，具体地交代政策界限和工作方法，使他们充分了解国家夏粮征、购工作的重要性，吸取去年夏粮征、购工作的经验教训，认真克服主观片面的思想方法和工作方法，在正确贯彻政策的基础上，努力完成夏粮征、购任务。另一方面，应该教育广大农业生产合作社的干部和社员以及个体农户，使他们充分认识到节约粮食对国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的一致性，从而使他们在夏收时能够积极自觉地做到细收细打，颗粒还家，并且将粮食晒干扬净，完成国家夏粮征、购任务。
                                总理  周恩来
                                            1957年6月11日
