"The Common People" and Pork
Zhang Hua

　　Someone is speaking on behalf of "the common people," comparing the current situation with that before Liberation, saying:
　　"When the Japanese came, weren't the common people still welcoming them?"
　　Now, "pork is in short supply, and the common people can't get enough to eat," "this is a decline in living standards."
　　To avoid "misunderstanding," I would like to ask: before Liberation, who exactly were those "common people" who could afford to eat pork and welcomed the Japanese who invaded China? To be clearer, who were they?
　　Another representative of "the common people" said:
　　"Speaking of pork... if pork cannot be bought, it is unconvincing to say that living standards have improved."
　　Just speaking of pork, if pork was available before Liberation, it would probably be "convincing" to say that living standards were higher at that time, right?
　　Whenever the topic of living standards comes up, people think of pork. "Cannot be bought," "cannot get enough to eat" (to be more precise, it is not easy to buy, and eat less) means "living standards have declined."
　　It seems that "the common people's" dining tables have always been inseparable from pork.
　　"...Before Liberation... we ate half chaff and vegetables and half grain," "In the past, eight out of ten families couldn't get enough to eat, let alone meat." This is what Yang Qingxiu, a farmer from Yougang Township, Hanshou, Hunan, said (see People's Daily, June 7th).
　　"Speaking for myself, except for festivals, I never tasted anything oily all year round!" "But now?... My family of several not only doesn't worry about food and clothing, but also bought a radio, and we eat meat every week." This is what Liu Chenghun, a trolley driver from Beijing, said (see Beijing Daily, June 10th).
　　According to past habits, farmers and trolley drivers are collectively referred to as "the common people."
　　But these "common people" are not those "common people." They can be clearly distinguished by their relationship with pork.
　　Anything with feathers and wings that can fly is collectively referred to as a bird. Everyone knows that there is more than one kind of bird. Even in the dark night, it is not difficult to distinguish a oriole from a crow; just listen to their calls.

### “老百姓”和猪肉

　　“老百姓”和猪肉
　　张化
    有人代表“老百姓”说话了，拿现在情况与解放前相比，说：
    “日本人来的时候老百姓还不是照样欢迎”。
    现在“猪肉紧张，老百姓吃不上”、“这是生活水平降低”。
    为避免“误解”起见，我想问问：解放前能吃得上猪肉，对侵略中国的日本人表示欢迎的那些“老百姓”，说得清楚一点，究竟是什么人？
    另一个“老百姓”的代表说：
    “从猪肉来说……猪肉买不到，说生活提高不能服人”。
    就这么从猪肉来说吧，解放前猪肉是买得到的，说那时生活较高，大概可以“服人”了吧？
    一提起生活水平，就想起猪肉来了。“买不到”，“吃不上”（说得实际些，是不容易买，吃得少），就是“生活水平降低”。
    可见“老百姓”的饭桌上一向是离不开猪肉的。
    “……解放前……我们吃的是半年糠菜半年粮”，“过去十户人家，有八家吃不饱饭，更难吃到肉。”这是湖南汉寿酉港乡农民杨清秀说的（见6月7日人民日报）。
    “拿我自己来说，过去一年里头除了过节，嘴巴就没有沾过腥味呀！”“现在呢？……一家几口人，不但吃穿不发愁，还买了收音机，每星期都要吃肉。”这是北京电车司机刘成勋说的（见6月10日北京日报）。
    按照过去的习惯，农民和电车司机统称为“老百姓”。
    但此“老百姓”，非彼“老百姓”也，从他们和猪肉的关系可以分得清清楚楚。
    身披羽毛，有翅能飞的，统称为鸟。谁都知道鸟绝不只一种。即使在黑夜里，黄莺和乌鸦也是不难辨别的，听它叫两声就行了。
