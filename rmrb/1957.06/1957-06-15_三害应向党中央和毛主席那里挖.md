　　"’Eliminating the Three Evils' Should Start with the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao"
　　Lecturer at Shaanxi Normal College　Wang Zunyi
    Now that the Party is wisely calling on us to direct our spearhead at the "three evils" in the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, it is not difficult for us to know that bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism do not exist in individual organs or individual schools, but are universally present in China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Then, to eradicate the "three evils," shouldn't we dig into the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao?
    Let me first talk about sectarianism among the three evils!
    The founding of the People's Republic of China is indeed a great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party, but from then on, the Communist Party became proud, thinking that we had conquered the world, the regime should be in our hands, we can be officials as we please, and the people can only obey the orders, commands, and arrangements of the Communist Party. How can the people have the freedom of thought and speech granted by the Constitution?
    Now we only have two chairmen of the country, and more than ten premiers of the State Council, but not one is a non-Party member. Is this not a manifestation of sectarianism at the central level? In terms of the political system, is this a "people's democratic" country? During the Yuan Dynasty, the people of the whole country were divided into four classes. The first and most noble class was the Mongols, the second was the Semu people, the third was the Han people, and the fourth was the Southern Song people. At that time, the ruling power was in the hands of the Mongols, followed by the Semu people, while the Han and Song people were merely in the position of being ruled. We call this kind of politics "national oppression". For example, after the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass, important political positions were set up in duplicate, such as Grand Secretaries of the Inner Cabinet and Ministers of the Six Ministries, each held by a Manchu and a Han person, with the Manchu official holding a higher rank and the Han official holding a lower rank. The Manchu official had the position and the power, while the Han official had the position but no power. We also call this kind of politics "national oppression". However, looking back at today, the people of the whole country can also be divided into four classes. The first and most noble class is the Communist Party members, the second is the Communist Youth League members, the third is the democratic parties, and the fourth is the masses. Now, in our country, apart from the Chairman of the State and the Premier of the State Council, the heads of state organs, schools, and enterprises are also mostly set up in duplicate. The head is always a Party member, and the deputy is occasionally a democratic person, but the democratic person mostly has the position but no power. Apart from the difference in essence, what is the difference between this kind of political form and the Yuan Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty? What should this kind of political system be called, I don't know.
    In the past few years, when mistakes have occurred in various departments and corners, it is always said that the lower levels have deviations in the implementation of policies, or that they have not grasped Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, the hasty promulgation of decrees, frequent changes, conservatism, rashness, then conservatism again, and then rashness again, such vacillation, is still said to be to adapt to the development of the situation. In addition, all discussions have become formalities, and serious and earnest discussions cannot be carried out at all. The leadership treats those who flatter, fawn, and brown-nose as activists, believing that they are politically reliable and can be promoted. Those who have slight doubts about policies and calls, or put forward different opinions, are considered to be ideologically backward, unprogressive, conservative, and stubborn, and even labeled as anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary elements. In this way, who dares to offer a word of criticism to the Party? One can only learn from "the golden man who keeps his mouth shut."
    Now I will give a few historical examples, these are familiar stories: King Li of Zhou was fond of wealth, and the people of the country slandered the king. The king sent the witch of Wei to monitor the slander and report it, then killed the slanderers. The people did not dare to speak, and they communicated with their eyes on the road. King Li was pleased and told Shao Hu, saying, "I can stop the slander." Shao Hu said, "This is blocking it. Preventing the people from speaking is more dangerous than preventing a river. If the river is blocked, it will burst and injure many people. The people are the same. Therefore, those who manage the river should dredge it and guide it, and those who govern the people should announce it and allow them to speak." King Li did not listen, so the people did not dare to speak. After three years, the people finally could not bear it and became riotous, and King Li fled to Zhi.
    The second is that after Qin Shi Huang unified China, in order to consolidate the cause of his descendants for ten thousand generations, he first came up with a set of methods to control thought and speech. Qin Shi Huang's control of thought and speech not only targeted the thought and speech of the time, but also the things of history. As long as they did not conform to his autocratic taste, they were severely banned. He implemented "burning books and burying scholars", even "those who whispered about it were abandoned in the market", "those who talked about poetry and books were beheaded", and "those who affirmed the past and denied the present were exterminated". However, Qin Shi Huang's brutal rule was quickly overthrown by the people. Historically, there are many examples of disastrous defeats due to the suppression of freedom of thought and speech.
    The Party's bureaucracy is mainly manifested in the insufficiently democratic election system, which is also praised as "democratic centralism". For example, if you elect one person, you only nominate one candidate; if you elect two people, you only nominate two candidates. This kind of election has completely become a formality. Has the candidate concentrated the opinions of the masses? Is this kind of election method democratic? Only "God knows".
    Finally, I want to appeal to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao: First, open up the regime and establish a truly people's democratic country; second, truly give the people freedom of thought and speech and liberate human individuality; third, broaden the scale of democracy and give the people a real democratic life; fourth, I ask Chairman Mao, I ask you to step down from your throne, go deep into the countryside, and see the living conditions of the peasants.

### “‘三害’应向党中央和毛主席那里挖”

　　“‘三害’应向党中央和毛主席那里挖”
　　陕西师范学院讲师　王尊一
    现在党英明地号召我们，在大鸣大放中我们的矛头要对准“三害”，但是我们不难知道，官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义不是存在在个别机关或个别学校里，是在目前中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国普遍地存在着。那么我们要根除“三害”是不是应向党中央和毛主席那里挖掘一下呢？
    我先谈谈三害中的宗派主义吧！
    中华人民共和国的成立，中国共产党的确有伟大的功勋，但从此共产党骄傲起来了，以为天下是我们打下的，政权应由我们掌握，好官我自为之，人民只能听从共产党的命令、指挥和摆布，人民那有宪法上赋予的思想、言论的自由。
    现在我们国家的主席只有两个，国务院总理有十余人，但都没有一个党外人士，这算不算是中央的宗派主义的表现呢？在政治体制上说，这算不算是一个“人民民主制”的国家呢？元朝时候，把全国人民分为四等，第一等最高贵的人是蒙古人，第二等是色目人，第三等是汉人，第四等是南宋人。当时统治权在蒙古人手里掌握，其次才是由色目人掌握，汉人和宋人只是处于被统治者的地位罢了。我们把这种政治叫做“民族压迫”。再如清朝入关以后，政治要职都设复职，如内阁大学士和六部尚书，满、汉人各担任一职，满人官品高，汉人官品低，满官有职有权，汉官有职无权。这种政治我们也把它叫做“民族压迫”。但是，反观今天，全国人民也可分为四等，第一等最高贵的人是共产党员，第二等是共青团员，第三等是民主党派，第四等是群众。现在我们国家除过国家主席、国务院总理以外，国家机关、学校、企业的首长，也是多设复职。正的总是由党员担任，副的偶有民主人士，但民主人士多是有职无权。这种政治的形式，除了本质不同外，和元朝、清朝又有什么区别呢？这种政治制度，应该叫他个甚么名字，我不知道。
    几年来，在各个部门和各个角落，工作发生了错误，总是说下级执行政策有偏差，或者说没有掌握马列主义和毛泽东思想。但是，政令的草率颁布，更张频繁，保守、冒进、又保守、又冒进这样摇摆不定，还说是为了适应情况的发展。另外，一切讨论变成了形式，严肃认真的讨论根本展不开。领导上对待恭维、奉承、吹牛拍马的人认为是积极分子，认为政治上可靠，可以得到提拔或升官。对待在政策、号召上稍存怀疑，或提出不同看法的人，便认为是思想落后，不进步、保守顽固，甚至给戴上反党、反人民和反革命分子的大帽子。这样一来，谁还敢对党提出一个字的批评呢？只有学“金人三缄其口”了。
    我现在又来举几个历史上的事例，这是大家熟悉的故事：周厉王好财货，国人谤王，王使卫巫监谤以告则杀之，国人莫敢言，道路以目，厉王喜，以告召虎，曰：“吾能弭谤矣”。召虎曰：“是障之也，防民之口，甚于防川，川壅而溃，伤人必多，民亦如之，是故为川者决之使导，为民者宣之使言。”厉王不从，于是国人莫敢言。如是者三年，民终无忍，成为暴乱，厉王奔彘。
    第二个是嬴秦统一中国以后，为了巩固他的子孙万世之业，首先来了一套统治思想言论的办法。嬴秦的统治思想言论，不只对当时的思想言论，并且对历史上的东西，只要是不符合其专制口味的，都加以严厉的取缔。实行“焚书坑儒”，甚至“偶语者弃市”，“谈论诗书者斩首”，“是古非今者灭族”。但是，嬴秦的残暴统治很快的被人民推翻了。历史上，由于压迫思想言论的自由，而遭到惨败的事例是很多的。
    党的官僚主义主要表现在不够民主的选举制度上，这种选举制度还美其名曰“民主集中制”。比如选一个人，只提一个候选人，选两个人只提两个候选人，这种选举完全成为形式。候选人是否集中了群众的意见？这种选举办法是否民主？只有“天知道”。
    最后，我要向中国共产党和毛主席呼吁：一、开放政权，建立一个真正的人民民主国家；二、真正给人民以思想言论的自由，解放人类个性；三、把民主的尺度放宽些，给人民以真实的民主生活；四、我要求毛主席，我要求你走下你的宝座，深入农村，看看农民的生活情况。
