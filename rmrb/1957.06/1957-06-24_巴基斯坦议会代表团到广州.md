Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 23rd: A Pakistani parliamentary delegation headed by Mujibur Rahman, General Secretary of the East Pakistan People's League, arrived in Guangzhou from Shenzhen this afternoon. They are visiting China at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and will spend twenty-one days visiting cities such as Beijing, Shenyang, Anshan, and Shanghai. They will also visit Xinjiang to see the lives of Muslims in our country.

Leader Rahman told reporters that the Pakistani people are very eager to understand the changes that have taken place in China in recent years. Therefore, he led this delegation, representing different parties and including female representatives, to China to learn about the political system, the development of industry and agriculture, education, and other aspects of construction.

Rahman also said that since Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China last year, and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Pakistan, the friendly relations between the two countries have been further enhanced. He hopes that this visit will lead to a closer understanding between them.

The Pakistani parliamentary delegation was greeted in Guangzhou from Shenzhen by Qu Wu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. They were welcomed by Tao Zhu, Governor of Guangdong Province, and Guo Qiaoran, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou. Children from the Guangzhou Qingzhen Elementary School presented flowers to these Muslim guests from afar.

In the evening, Tao Zhu hosted a banquet to welcome the distinguished guests. The entire delegation is scheduled to fly to Beijing tomorrow morning.
