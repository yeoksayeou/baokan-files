Schools Run by the People

    In Shenyang, the people have been running schools themselves since 1952. In 1953, the Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau carried out a reorganization of private schools, and ten of them have been retained to this day. The teachers and staff working in these schools, adhering to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running schools, relying on the strength of society and the masses, have overcome many difficulties in teaching, enabling these schools to develop steadily. The scale of the schools has gradually expanded, and the teaching equipment has gradually increased, and therefore they are warmly welcomed by the masses. Wang Zhi, the director of teaching affairs at the Shenyang Bajiazi Cultural Supplementary School, and Yang Jiayin, the principal of the Yuqun Cultural Supplementary School, said that cultural supplementary schools have five advantages: First, running schools does not require the state to spend money, which reduces the state's financial expenditure; second, it solves the problem of schooling for out-of-school students, giving them the opportunity to continue to consolidate and improve their cultural level; third, it stabilizes the work of students' parents; fourth, it solves the employment problem for some intellectuals; and fifth, it cultivates talents for the country's construction, which is beneficial to the entire socialist construction. At present, many students hope to continue their studies after graduation, but the schools run by the state cannot accommodate so many students, so it seems very necessary to establish some private schools appropriately.

    In Bajiazi, a suburb of Shenyang, there is a cultural supplementary school run by the people themselves. Most of the students in this school are graduates of senior primary schools. The Shenyang Bajiazi Cultural Supplementary School was started in early 1952 under the active advocacy of street cadres by three teachers, including Li Zhenyi. At that time, there were only more than fifty students, divided into two classes. Over the past few years, this school has developed greatly. Now, the school has 416 students in total, divided into six classes (including one senior primary school class), and there are seven full-time teachers. This year, the school has added three courses: physical education, music, and art. The tuition fee of this school is very low, only 2.8 yuan per month for each student. Students with financial difficulties are charged half the fee, and there are also many free students. The salaries of teachers are not high either. With the strong help of street cadres, the school is run very well, the teaching quality of teachers is high, and the progress of students is also very fast.

    Shenyang Yuqun Cultural Supplementary School was established in September 1955. This is also a junior middle school established at its own expense. At present, the school has a total of 1,045 students and 19 part-time teachers. The school has 19 classes in total, implementing a three-shift teaching system, and also has an attached high school class. When this school was first established, the equipment was very simple, with only a few desks. Now, the school has a complete set of classroom equipment. The school was started with 1,050 yuan raised by four teachers, and they have withdrawn the original amount after one year. In less than two years, the total assets of this school, if estimated, have reached more than 14,000 yuan. (Photo attached)

    The Shenyang Yuqun Cultural Supplementary School implements a three-shift system, so organizing students' extracurricular self-study is a very important task. The school also has a high school class with 60 students, and their extracurricular learning is organized even better. This is Zhang Guocai (right), the leader of the self-study group, answering questions during their self-study.

    In order to meet social needs, the Shenyang Bajiazi Cultural Supplementary School will also expand the number of classes this year. Now, a new classroom has been built.

    After learning that the school's students were increasing and there was a lack of activity space, the Bajiazi Agricultural Cooperative decided to allocate seven mu of land to the school free of charge. The teachers and students are very grateful to the farmers for this selfless and great help. This is the students happily leveling the ground.

    When teaching first-year students about plants, they used the agricultural cooperative's vegetable cellar for object teaching.

    The Yuqun Cultural Supplementary School has specially set up a problem-solving board, where teachers provide comprehensive answers to problems that students cannot solve. This allows every student to gain something.

    群众兴办的学校
    在沈阳市，群众从1952年开始自己办学。1953年，沈阳市教育局对民办学校进行过一次整顿，到现在还保留着十处。在这些学校里工作的教职员们，本着勤俭办学的精神依靠社会、群众的力量，克服了教学方面的许多困难，使这些学校稳步发展。学校的规模逐渐扩大了，教学设备逐渐增加了，因此受到群众的热烈欢迎。沈阳八家子文化补习学校教导主任王峙和育群文化补习学校校长杨嘉荫说，文化补习学校有五好：一、办学校不要国家拿钱，减少了国家的财政开支；二、解决了失学学生的就学问题，使他们有继续巩固、提高文化水平的机会；三、安定了学生家长的工作；四、解决了一部分知识分子的就业问题；五、为国家培养了建设人才，对整个社会主义建设有利。在目前，许多学生毕业后希望继续升学，而国家办的学校容纳不了这许多学生，所以适当成立一些民办学校看来是很必要的。
    在沈阳市郊区八家子有一所群众自办的文化补习学校，这所学校里的学生多数是高小毕业生。沈阳八家子文化补习学校是1952年初在街道干部的积极倡导下，由李贞一等三位老师开始筹办起来的。当时只有五十多个学生，分两个班。几年来，这所学校有了很大发展，现在，全校学生已有四百一十六名，共分六个班（内有一高小班），有七位专职教师。学校今年又增加了体育、音乐、美术三门课程。这个学校的学费很低，每个学生每月只交二元八角，家庭有困难的学生就收半费，另外还有不少免费生。教师的薪金也不高。学校在街道干部的大力帮助下办得很好，教师的教学质量高，学生的进步也很快。
    沈阳育群文化补习学校是在1955年9月建立的，这也是一个自费兴办的初级中学。现在，全校共有一千零四十五名学生，有十九位兼职教师。全校设十九个班，实行三班制教学，还有一个附设的高中班。这个学校开始成立时，设备非常简单，只有几张办公桌。现在，全校已有了一套完整的课堂设备。学校开始时是由四位老师集资一千零五十元兴办的，一年以后他们已将原数款项抽回。不到两年的时间，这个学校的全部财产如果估算一下，已经达到了一万四千多元。（附图片）
    沈阳育群文化补习学校是三班制，所以组织学生课外自学是件非常重要的工作。学校还设有一个有六十名学生的高中班，他们的课外学习组织得更好。这是他们自学时由自学小组组长张国才（右）在解答问题。
    沈阳八家子文化补习学校为了满足社会需要，今年还要扩大班次。现在，一所新教室又建筑起来了。
    八家子农业社知道这个学校的学生增多、缺少活动的场地后，决定无代价拨给学校七亩地。老师和学生们非常感激农民们这种无私的大力帮助。这是学生们高兴地平整场地。
    在给一年级学生上植物课时，他们利用了农业社的菜窖进行实物教学。
    育群文化补习学校特别设立了一块解答板，学生们解答不了的问题，由教师在此做全面解答。这样，能使每个学生得到收获。
