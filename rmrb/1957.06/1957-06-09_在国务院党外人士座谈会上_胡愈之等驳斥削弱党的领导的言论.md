(Special dispatch from our newspaper via Xinhua News Agency) Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun continued to invite non-Party members to a symposium on the afternoon of June 8.

    State Council Counselor Chen Xiaocen spoke about the legal system and personnel issues. He said that in the eight years since the founding of the country, no procedural laws have been promulgated, many agencies lack organizational laws, and there are no business regulations. He believes that some Party members do not pay attention to the legal system but pay more attention to personnel arrangements. Regarding personnel issues, he believes that outsiders are very busy while insiders are idle. For example, in the publishing industry, many people who have not been engaged in publishing business serve as presidents of publishing houses, with outsiders filling in for insiders, causing many losses in the publishing industry.

    Chen Xiaocen said that in their work, some Party members are impatient and rash, pursuing numbers and overfulfilling tasks. For example, in publishing work, they blindly pursue how many types are printed and how many copies are published, but they do not ask what the readers need. As a result, some books are piled up in warehouses, while others are out of stock.

    Hu Yuzhi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, spoke about two points at the meeting. His first point was: The Communist Party should greatly strengthen its core leadership role in state organs, especially strengthening the Party's leadership over cultural and educational organs. He believes that in the eight years since our country's founding, the achievements of our state organs are the main aspect, and the shortcomings and mistakes are individual cases. Although some people do not like this statement, the fact remains a fact.

    Hu Yuzhi said that the Party and the government should have a division of labor, and it is wrong for the Party to replace the government; but if the Party does not ask about politics, if the Party withdraws from organs and schools, and if all policies and plans are not passed through the Communist Party but are only designed and implemented by administrative organs, our state organs will lose contact with the masses, and the People's Government will deteriorate and become a yamen detached from the people.

    Hu Yuzhi said that today, many errors and shortcomings have indeed occurred, which must be exposed and corrected; but a large part of these errors and shortcomings are due to the too rapid development of work, and they are generated in the course of progress, and some are inevitable. In order to correct these errors and shortcomings, the main thing is to further strengthen the Party's leadership, not to weaken it.

    Hu Yuzhi's second point was: The Party should greatly strengthen ideological and political education, especially helping intellectuals to conduct self-education and self-reform. He said that due to the successive victories of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the economic foundation has changed, but people's ideological awareness still lags behind the material foundation. Among some intellectuals from the old society, reactionary ideas sometimes emerge again. This can also be proved by the anonymous letter exposed by Lu Yuwen.

    Hu Yuzhi said that some reactionary remarks that have recently appeared have aroused indignation not only among the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant but also among the broad masses of the people. He believes that this kind of thinking should be made clear to the people of the whole country so as not to be misled. Hu Yuzhi believes that ideological education should be strengthened, especially the ideological remolding of intellectuals. If reactionary bourgeois ideas continue to flood, the distance between intellectuals and workers and peasants can never be shortened, and the future of socialism will be in danger.

    Wang Zhixiang, consultant to the Bureau of Legal Affairs, said that clarifying the truth and distinguishing right from wrong regarding incorrect opinions during the rectification campaign cannot be said to be "tightening up." Wang Zhixiang agreed with Lu Yuwen's criticism of Chu Anping's speech and offered supplementary comments. He believes that the Party's leadership cannot be confused with the Party's domination of the world. Now that the Communist Party exists as the leading party, and at the same time there are democratic parties, and the people exercise their power through the National People's Congress and people's congresses at all levels, and in reality, housewives also widely participate in grassroots management work. The claim of the Party dominating the world is unfounded.

    Li Qizhong, a counselor of the State Council, expressed his agreement with Hu Yuzhi's speech. He added that one factor of sectarianism—privilege—must be overcome first in the rectification campaign, starting with resolving personnel issues. In the past, some people were arranged not for the sake of work but to save face, to accommodate history and contributions. This situation should be changed. Those whose work ability does not match their position should be adjusted, and special treatment for senior cadres in life should also be abolished. This can reduce conflicts.

    In his speech, Li Qizhong also criticized the current unclear system and establishment, the lack of service rules and work inspection systems, the fact that heads of business departments do not manage personnel, and the low work quotas and excessive overtime wages in some enterprises.

### 在国务院党外人士座谈会上  胡愈之等驳斥削弱党的领导的言论

    在国务院党外人士座谈会上
    胡愈之等驳斥削弱党的领导的言论
    本报特约新华社专稿　国务院秘书长习仲勋6月8日下午继续邀请党外人士举行座谈会。
    国务院参事谌小岑谈到了法制和人事问题，他说，立国八年来，没有颁布程序法，许多机关没有组织法，没有业务法规。他认为党内有人不注意法制，而对人事安排比较注意。关于人事问题，他认为外行很忙，内行闲着。例如出版界有许多没有搞过出版业务的担任出版社社长，外行充内行，造成出版界的很多损失。
    谌小岑说，在工作中，有些党员急躁冒进，追求数字和超额完成任务，例如出版工作中就盲目追求印行多少种、出多少册，但又不问读者需要，于是有的书堆满仓库，有的脱销。
    中国文字改革委员会副主任胡愈之在会上谈到了两点意见。他的第一个意见是：共产党应当大大加强在国家机关中的核心领导作用，特别是加强党对文教机关的领导。他认为八年多以来，我们国家机关工作的成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是个别的。尽管有人不喜欢这样的提法，但事实仍然是事实。
    胡愈之说，党和政应当分工，以党代政是不对的；但是如果党不要问政，党退出机关学校，一切方针政策不要通过共产党，而只是由行政机关来设计和施工，我们的国家机关就会失掉同群众的联系，人民政府就会变质，就会变成脱离人民的衙门。
    胡愈之说，今天的确发生了许多错误和缺点，是必须加以揭发和纠正的；但这些错误和缺点很大部分是因为工作发展太快，是在前进中产生的，有些是不可避免的。为了纠正这些错误和缺点，主要是更加加强党的领导，而不是削弱党的领导。
    胡愈之的第二个意见是：党要大大加强思想政治教育工作，特别是帮助知识分子进行自我教育和自我改造。他说，由于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的着着胜利，经济基础已经起了改变，但是人们的思想意识依然落后于物质基础。在一部分从旧社会出身的知识分子中间，反动的思想有时又冒出头来。从卢郁文揭发的那封匿名信也可以证明。
    胡愈之说，最近出现的一些反动言论，不仅石景山钢铁厂的职工，广大的人民都表示愤慨。他认为，这种思想应该让全国人民看清楚，以免受到迷惑。胡愈之认为要加强思想教育工作，特别是对知识分子的思想改造。如果反动的资产阶级思想依然泛滥，知识分子和工农之间的距离永远不能缩短，社会主义的前途就有危险。
    法制局顾问王之相说，整风中对不正确的意见讲清道理，分清是非，这不能说是“收”。王之相同意卢郁文对储安平发言的批评，并提出了补充意见。他认为，不能把党的领导和党天下混淆起来，现在有共产党作为领导党，同时又有民主党派存在，人民通过全国人民代表大会和各级人民代表大会行使权力，从实际上看，家庭妇女也广泛参加了基层的管理工作。党天下的说法是没有根据的。
    国务院参事李奇中对胡愈之的发言表示同意。他又说，宗派主义的一个因素——特权，整风中首先要克服，先要从人事上解决。过去安排了一些人，不是为了工作，而是为了照顾面子，迁就历史、功劳，应该改变这种情况，工作能力和职位不相称的要调整，对高级干部在生活上的特殊照顾也应该取消，这样可以减少矛盾。
    李奇中在发言中还对当前体制和编制不明确、没有服务细则和工作检查制度、业务部门负责人不管人事、有些企业单位工作定额低，超额工资过高等情况，提出了批评。
