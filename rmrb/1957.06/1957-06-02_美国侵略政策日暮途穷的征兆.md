    Recently, within a week, the U.S. aggression policy suffered two heavy blows in succession. The anti-American demonstration in Taiwan on May 24 was a strong protest by eight million patriotic Taiwanese compatriots against the U.S. aggression policy of occupying Taiwan, our territory; on May 30, Britain announced the relaxation of the so-called "trade controls" on China, opening a large gap in the U.S. "embargo" policy.

    The righteous actions of the Taiwan compatriots not only stirred up another upsurge in the anti-American struggle of the entire Chinese people, but also had far-reaching repercussions in Asian countries and other regions of the world. The U.S. occupation of Taiwan is only part of its policy of seeking world hegemony. In the territories of many countries in Asia and other regions of the world, the U.S. occupies as many as 250 military bases, with a total of 1.2 million U.S. troops stationed abroad. The U.S. barbarously infringes upon the sovereignty of other countries; U.S. military personnel stationed abroad run rampant and break the law everywhere, especially in Asian countries, where they abuse extraterritorial rights, kill, plunder, and do everything. The people of all countries, especially the people of Asian countries, have long resented the U.S. aggression policy. The Taiwan compatriots rose up with sleeves bared to resist U.S. oppression, which triggered the enthusiasm of the people of Asian countries to safeguard their national sovereignty and independence. People from all walks of life and social opinion in the Philippines have firmly demanded the reopening of U.S.-Philippine negotiations to resolve the issue of jurisdiction over U.S. troops. The Japanese people are even more enraged by the case of U.S. soldier Girard killing Sakai Naka, and have unanimously risen up to demand that the U.S. hand over the murderer. This situation has made people in the U.S. ruling group worry that the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan will "damage our (U.S.) position in Asia." Some U.S. extreme aggressors, such as Nolan, also believe that we (the United States) should "reconsider our overall position abroad."

    The development of events has shown that the patriotic struggle of the Taiwan compatriots is not only a blow to the U.S. policy of occupying Taiwan, but also further exposes the crisis of the U.S. military base policy around the world.

    Britain's break with the U.S. on the "embargo" policy and its unilateral action has an impact not only on the relationship between the U.S. and Britain, but also on the "embargo" itself. After Britain's defeat in the war of aggression against Egypt, it was already the second time that it had strived to break free from the shackles of the U.S. and take independent action in its foreign policy. In April, the British Conservative government published a defense white paper, ignoring the pressure from the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, and decided to reduce the number of armed forces (including the withdrawal of a part of the British garrison in continental Europe) and develop nuclear weapons, which had greatly displeased the U.S. ruling group. The U.S. is particularly worried that Britain's measures to reduce its armed forces will cause a so-called "chain reaction" in other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. Just as many countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot bear the heavy burden of military expenditures, more than just Britain is dissatisfied with the U.S. "embargo" policy among the U.S. allies. According to Western news agencies, at the so-called "China Committee" meeting held in Paris, in addition to Britain, Japan, West Germany, and France actively demanded the relaxation of the "embargo"; the Norwegian Foreign Ministry also stated that "Norway's point of view is in principle close to the attitude of Britain." Therefore, after Britain announced its decision, officials in Washington were very worried that other countries would soon follow Britain's example. This will be another "chain reaction" of unwillingness to follow U.S. policy. What's more, British public opinion is no longer satisfied with relaxing the "embargo," and the Conservative Party's "Daily Express" recently advocated "abolishing the entire embargo." This prospect, of course, makes the U.S. ruling group uneasy.

    The "embargo" policy is closely linked to the U.S. military bloc policy. The so-called "Paris Coordinating Committee" which planned the "embargo" measures is an affiliated agency of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by the U.S.. And the reason why the U.S. is able to force its allies to implement the "embargo" policy that harms their own interests is mainly with the Battle Act of canceling military and economic "aid" to these countries as a threatening tool. And U.S. foreign "aid" is a major link in the U.S. military bloc policy. Now the Battle Act and military and economic "aid" can no longer restrain Britain and other countries that will follow Britain's example. Under such circumstances, can the U.S. continue to control all its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without restriction in other aspects as in the past?

    There is a Chinese saying: "When a leaf falls, you know autumn is coming." The setbacks and failures that the U.S. aggression policy has suffered in succession cannot but be a sign that this policy has reached its end.

    However, the U.S. ruling group refuses to face reality. After the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated that this would not change the U.S. Far East policy and the policy toward the Chiang Kai-shek group in any way. Not only that, the U.S. bourgeois newspaper "New York Post" has re-proposed the idea of ​​"UN Trusteeship of Taiwan." The so-called "trusteeship of Taiwan" is actually a conspiracy planned by the Pentagon to further turn Taiwan into a U.S. territory. As for the "embargo" policy, the statement issued by the U.S. State Department, in addition to expressing "great disappointment" with Britain's actions, also stated that it would continue to implement its "comprehensive embargo policy." All of this shows that although the U.S. aggression policy is riddled with holes, the U.S. ruling group still stubbornly continues to implement this policy in order to maintain and create tension, so as to prevent their policy from completely collapsing.

    However, the anti-American struggle of the Chinese people and the Asian people aroused by the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan continues to develop; although Britain's efforts to break through the U.S. "embargo" policy are still very incomplete, this still has a beneficial influence on promoting friendly cooperation and economic exchanges between the East and the West. The trend of the international situation moving towards relaxation is unstoppable by the U.S. aggression policy. The U.S. ruling group's continued insistence on its aggression policy can only lead to greater failures.

### 美国侵略政策日暮途穷的征兆

    美国侵略政策日暮途穷的征兆
    最近，在一个星期之内，美国的侵略政策接连遭到了两次沉重的打击。5月24日台湾的反美大示威，是八百万爱国的台湾同胞对美国侵占我国领土台湾的侵略政策的强烈抗议；5月30日，英国宣布放宽对中国的所谓“贸易管制”，给美国的“禁运”政策打开了一个大缺口。
    台湾同胞的义举，不仅激起了全中国人民反美斗争的又一次高潮，而且在亚洲各国和世界其他地区也得到了深远的回响。美国侵占台湾，只是它独霸世界的政策的一部分。在亚洲和世界其他地区的许多国家的领土上，美国侵占的军事基地达二百五十处之多，派驻在国外的美国部队共有一百二十万人之众。美国横蛮地侵犯别国的主权；驻在国外的美国军事人员到处横行不法，特别是在亚洲国家中滥用治外法权，杀人越货，无所不为。各国人民，特别是亚洲国家的人民，对美国的侵略政策早有积愤。台湾同胞攘臂而起，反抗美国的压迫，这就触发了亚洲国家人民维护自己国家的主权和独立的热情。菲律宾的各阶层人士和社会舆论已坚决要求重开美菲谈判，以解决对美军的审判权的问题。日本人民由于美军士兵哲腊德杀害坂井中案更是怒不可遏，一致奋起要美国交出杀人凶犯。这种情势使美国统治集团人士也在担忧台湾的反美示威会“损害我们（美国）在亚洲的地位”。一些美国极端的侵略分子，如诺兰之流，也认为应该“重新考虑我们（美国）在国外所处的全面地位”。
    事情的发展已经显示出：台湾同胞的爱国斗争，不仅是对美国侵占台湾政策的打击，而且也进一步挑开了美国在世界各处的军事基地政策的危机。
    英国在“禁运”政策上与美国决裂而单独行事，其影响既不仅限于美英之间的关系，也不仅限于“禁运”本身。英国在侵略埃及的战争失败后，在对外政策上努力摆脱美国的束缚，采取独立的行动，这已是第二次了。4月间英国保守党政府公布了国防白皮书，不顾美国和其他北大西洋集团国家的压力，决定裁减武装部队人数（包括撤退在欧洲大陆的英国的一部分驻军）和发展核武器，就已使美国统治集团大为不快。美国特别担心，英国裁减武装部队的措施，会在其他北大西洋集团国家中引起所谓“连锁性反应”。正如北大西洋集团的许多国家不能忍受沉重的军费负担一样，在美国的盟国中也不止英国一个国家不满意美国的“禁运”政策。据西方通讯社的报道，在巴黎举行的所谓“中国委员会”的会议，积极要求放宽“禁运”的除英国之外，还有日本、西德和法国；挪威外交部也声明说：“挪威的观点在原则上已经接近英国的态度”。因此，在英国宣布了自己的决定之后，华盛顿的官员们就很担心其他国家不久将会学英国的样子。这又将是一个不愿追随美国政策的“连锁性反应”。何况，英国的舆论已经不能满足于放宽“禁运”，像保守党的“每日快报”最近就主张要“取消全部禁运”。这种前景，当然是美国统治集团梦寐不安的。
    “禁运”政策是同美国的军事集团政策紧密地连系着的。策划“禁运”措施的所谓“巴黎统筹委员会”就是由美国所控制的北大西洋集团的一个附属机构。并且美国所以能够迫使它的盟国执行损害它们自己利益的“禁运”政策，主要是以取消对这些国家的军事和经济“援助”的巴特尔法为威胁的工具。而美国的对外“援助”正是美国军事集团政策的一个主要环节。现在巴特尔法和军事、经济“援助”已经羁绊不住英国以及将要效法英国的其他国家了。在这种情况下，难道美国还能够继续像以往一样，在其他方面无限制地控制北大西洋集团的它的所有盟国吗？
    中国有句成语说：“叶落知秋”。美国侵略政策接连所遭受到的打击和失败，不能不是这种政策已经日暮途穷的征兆。
    可是，美国的统治集团是不肯正视现实的。在台湾的反美大示威之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开表示这不会使美国的远东政策和对蒋介石集团的政策有任何改变。不仅如此，美国资产阶级报纸“纽约邮报”还重新提出“联合国托管台湾”的主张。所谓“托管台湾”实际上是五角大楼早在策划的一个进一步把台湾变成美国属地的阴谋。至于在“禁运”政策上，美国国务院发表的声明除了表示对英国的行动感到“非常失望”之外，还表示要继续执行它的“全面禁运的政策”。这一切表明，尽管美国的侵略政策已是百孔千疮，但是美国统治集团却还要顽固地继续执行这种政策，来维持和制造紧张局势，以便使他们的政策免于彻底崩溃。
    然而，台湾反美大示威所激起的中国人民和亚洲人民的反美斗争正继续发展；英国在突破美国的“禁运”政策方面做得虽然还十分不彻底，但是这对于促进东西方的友好合作和经济交流依然起着有益的影响。国际局势日益走向和缓的趋势，是美国的侵略政策所阻挡不住的。美国统治集团继续坚持其侵略政策，只能使它遭受到更大的失败。
