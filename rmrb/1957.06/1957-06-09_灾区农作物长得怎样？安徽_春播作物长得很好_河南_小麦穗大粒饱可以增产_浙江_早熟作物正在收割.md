Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Areas in Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces that suffered from typhoons, heavy rain, and floods last year have begun their summer harvest, and crops are generally growing well.

    In disaster areas of Anhui province, wheat is growing particularly well, with average yield per unit area potentially exceeding 1955 levels to reach over 102 *jin*. Sorghum, spring corn, and other crops are also growing very well.

    In disaster areas of Henan province, spring-sown crops generally have full emergence due to sufficient soil moisture. The wheat that has already begun to be harvested has large and full ears, and production is expected to increase compared to last year. In the disaster area of Anyang County, 470,000 *mu* of wheat are expected to yield an average of 203 *jin* per *mu*.

    In disaster areas of Zhejiang province, agricultural cooperatives have increased planting of early-maturing crops this year to mitigate the impact of the disaster. In the disaster area of Ningbo Prefecture, potato planting area has increased by over 20% compared to last year. In Nanzhuang District of Xiangshan County, the area most severely affected by the disaster last year, all but over 1,000 *mu* of the 48,000 *mu* of land affected by seawater erosion, which was temporarily unsuitable for crop cultivation due to excessive salinity, has been planted with cotton and ramie. In the heavily affected Cixi County, harvesting of over 540,000 *mu* of barley, rapeseed, and broad beans has begun.

    After suffering from the disaster last year, these provinces' disaster areas launched a production self-salvation movement. The state and farmers in non-disaster areas vigorously supported the lives and production of disaster victims. Zhejiang Province alone issued over 34 million *yuan* in loans and relief funds in disaster areas. Therefore, no land in the disaster areas was left uncultivated.

    灾区农作物长得怎样？
    安徽——春播作物长得很好  河南——小麦穗大粒饱可以增产  浙江——早熟作物正在收割
    新华社7日讯　安徽、河南和浙江等省去年遭受台风、暴雨和洪水灾害的地区开始夏收，农作物一般长得不错。
    在安徽省灾区，小麦长得特别好，平均单位面积产量可能超过1955年达到一百零二斤以上。高粱、春玉米等作物也长得很好。
    在河南省灾区，由于墒足，春播作物一般出苗齐全。已经开镰收割的小麦，穗大粒饱，将比去年增产。安阳县灾区有四十七万亩小麦，预计平均每亩可收二百零三斤。
    在浙江省灾区，农业社为了减轻灾情，今年增种了早熟作物。宁波专区的灾区，马铃薯种植面积比去年增加20％以上。去年受灾最重的象山县南庄区，受过海水浸蚀的四万八千亩田地中，除盐质过重暂时不能种植农作物的一千多亩土地外，全部种上了棉花和络麻。受灾较重的慈溪县，有五十四万多亩大麦、油菜和蚕豆已经开始收割。
    这几个省的灾区在去年受灾以后就展开生产自救运动，国家和非灾区的农民，大力支援灾民的生活和生产，仅浙江省在灾区发放的贷款和救济款就有三千四百多万元。因此，灾区没有荒芜土地。
