　　Utilize Favorable Conditions to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
　　Zhejiang's Agricultural Production Conditions are Good This Year, But Different Priorities Should be Grasped According to Different Regions and Seasonal Characteristics

　　(Our newspaper's Hangzhou, June 17th dispatch) Reporter Liu Fan reports: The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently convened a rural work conference to discuss the issue of striving for a bumper agricultural harvest and resolving rural contradictions. The conference believed that striving for a bumper harvest is the main way to alleviate rural contradictions; and a bumper harvest must involve deeply resolving various specific problems within the cooperatives.

    The conference studied the favorable conditions for carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in various regions this year, and criticized the "it doesn't matter" attitude of some people.

    There are many favorable conditions for carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in Zhejiang's rural areas this year. For example, the Provincial Party Committee grasped this movement early; the arrangement of double-cropping rice planting area and varieties this year is more reasonable than last year, which is conducive to improving yield per unit area; 80% of the province's members have implemented the "three guarantees" responsibility system, improving operation and management; seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc. are more abundant than last year (the province has a bumper harvest of green manure, and the number of pigs raised has increased by more than 560,000 compared to last year); the water conservancy projects built throughout the province this year can benefit more than 5,640,000 mu of farmland.

    Combined with these favorable conditions, Rui'an, Pingyang and other counties have proposed eliminating blank land, cultivating rice seedlings, meticulous harvesting, and raising more pigs, chickens, ducks, rabbits, etc. Lishui County also proposed methods to increase grain production such as planting soybeans on the edges of fields and intercropping miscellaneous grains in sweet potato fields.

    The conference pointed out that carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement requires grasping different links in different periods and locations, according to the characteristics of the production season and the economic conditions of various regions. From now until the end of summer heat, the focus should be on rushing to harvest and plant, expanding the planting of high-yield crops, and strengthening the cultivation of autumn crops, ensuring grain production as the center. After the end of summer heat, the focus should be on developing diversified operations and actively developing animal husbandry.

    The conference also requested that all regions organize visits, exchange experiences, and carry out labor competitions after the movement is launched.

　　运用有利条件争取大丰收
　　浙江今年农业生产条件良好，但要根据不同地区和季节特点抓不同的重点
    本报杭州17日电　记者刘凡报道：中共浙江省委最近召开的农村工作会议，对争取农业大丰收和解决农村矛盾的问题作了讨论。会议认为争取丰收是缓和农村矛盾的主要办法；而丰收又必须深入解决合作社内的各种具体问题。
    会议研究了今年各地开展增产节约运动的有利条件，批判了有些人“无所谓”的态度。
    浙江省农村今年开展增产节约运动有不少有利条件。如省委对这个运动抓得早；今年双季稻种植面积和品种的安排比去年合理，有利于提高单位面积的产量；全省80％的社员贯彻了“三包”责任制，改善了经营管理；种子、肥料、农具等比去年充足（全省绿肥丰收，养猪比去年增加五十六万多头）；今年全省修建的水利工程可使五百六十四万多亩农田受益。
    结合这些有利条件，瑞安、平阳等县提出了消灭空白地，培育水稻，精打细收，多养猪、鸡、鸭、兔等。丽水县还提出田边田角种大豆，蕃薯地间种杂粮等办法增产粮食。
    会议指出，开展增产节约运动，要根据生产季节特点和各地经济情况，在不同时期，不同地点，抓住不同的环节。从现在到处暑以前，以抢收抢种、扩大高产作物种植，加强秋作物培育，保证粮食生产为中心。处暑以后，以开展多种经营、积极发展畜牧业为重点。
    会议还要求各地在运动开展后，组织参观、交流经验，开展劳动竞赛。
