	"Official Connections"
	Some Party member cadres not only think of themselves as superior, but also influence their families with this kind of thinking. The old Wang's daughter's husband next door is a section chief in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the old Wang's family feels that they have some "influence." The old Wang's family always has the "biggest say" in neighborhood squabbles like children fighting or disputes over chickens and dogs. Even the residents' group leader can't do anything about it. This is really bad.

    “官属”
    有些党员干部，不但自己有高人一等思想，还把这种思想影响给他的家属。隔壁老王家的女婿在市公安局当科长，老王家就觉得自家有点“势力”了。街坊邻右的孩子打架、争鸡夺狗的小事，都是老王家的“理大”。连居民组长也拿他没办法。这样真是太不好了。
