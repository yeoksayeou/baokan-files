No Room for Rightist Arguments Among the Working People
Handicraft Workers Resolutely Follow the Communist Party

　　(Our dispatch) The Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Union held a forum yesterday afternoon, inviting twenty-nine grass-roots cooperative cadres and members. Participants used their diverse experiences to refute the lies of the rightists. They reached a common conclusion: resolutely follow the Communist Party! Resolutely oppose the rightists. This firm and unwavering voice represents the will of the city's 100,400 handicraft workers.

　　Bai Shulan, a member of the Beijing Women's Embroidery Production Cooperative, said, "I am a housewife with no education. I started learning embroidery at the age of eight, and after getting married at seventeen, I continued to do embroidery. Before liberation, it was impossible to find work, and even if I did, the money I earned wasn't enough to eat. As a result, I had to beg on the streets. My first child froze to death on my back while I was begging in the streets; my second child also died because I couldn't afford medical treatment. Back then, people like us would build shacks in the city, but the Kuomintang would drive us out, saying we were unhygienic. Who treated us like human beings then! After liberation, we got better. I joined the cooperative in 1952, and my life has been improving every day. In the past, I hadn't bought an inch of cloth in ten years of marriage, but now all five members of my family wear new clothes; in the past, I hadn't bought a dime's worth of meat in ten years, but now we can often eat dumplings. Recently, I've been able to save a few yuan each month, and I already have more than eighty yuan in the bank. People like me were worthless in the past, but now I have been elected as a labor model of the Union, a member of the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, and a women's representative. How can I not be happy?" She concluded, "Our embroidery cooperative has more than eight thousand women who resolutely oppose the rightists and resolutely follow the Communist Party. Let those rightists who say people's lives have deteriorated come and see our cooperative!"

　　Several elderly cooperative members used their own experiences and personal feelings to illustrate that the lives of handicraft workers have improved far too much since liberation. They all said that without the leadership of the Communist Party, handicraft workers would not have the happy lives they have today. To say that life has deteriorated is truly unconscionable. Yang Shihui, a member of the First Ivory Cooperative and a renowned ivory carving artist, said, "I have lived in Beijing since I was a child. During the Japanese occupation, people were starving to death on the streets every day. We often ate mixed noodles, which upset my stomach. After the Japanese surrender, we craftsmen could only eat white flour dumplings during the Spring Festival. How can it compare to the abundance we have now? The rightists say they don't want the Communist Party's leadership. Do they want Chiang Kai-shek to come back?" Dong Maolin, an old artist from the Carved Lacquer Cooperative, said, "I am disabled. I started learning carved lacquer at the age of fifteen. Before liberation, I couldn't even get enough to eat; I was lucky not to starve to death. After liberation, the cooperative was organized, and I was guaranteed food. In 1955, at the age of forty-nine, I even got married, and last year I had a son. This is something I never thought would happen in my life, but it all came about in the few years after liberation." Ma Shenglin from the Metal and Aluminum Products Cooperative said, "The 'people' the rightists speak of can only represent landlords, bullies, and bureaucratic compradors; they cannot represent us working people at all. Therefore, they can only get applause from Taiwan." Huang Jiasheng from the First Food Cooperative said, "The rightists' intention in speaking out is to make us live lives worse than animals." Wang Shirong from the Third Woolen Fabric Cooperative said, "The rightists want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the same as taking the lives of us working people."

　　Zhong Zhongshi, the director of the Sixth Paper Box Cooperative, which was established last year, said, "The rightists say it's the 'Party's world.' I am not a Party member or a Youth League member, but I was elected as the director of the cooperative from the beginning. Chu Anping is not a Communist Party member either, but he became the head of Guangming Daily. Our cooperative is full of family members of revolutionary martyrs and poor citizens. What status did we have in society in the past, like ants? Now, not only is our life guaranteed, but our women can also manage national affairs. The rightists say it's the 'Party's world,' but we say it's the world of the working people. The comrades in our cooperative all say that without the Communist Party, there would be no today."

　　Xu Qiren, the accountant of the Third Enamel Cooperative, used to be a deputy company commander and police captain in the Kuomintang army. He was a target of the counter-revolutionary suppression campaign. Using his own experience, he refuted the lies that "the counter-revolutionary suppression campaign was a mess" and "the counter-revolutionary suppression campaign was meddling." He said, "After my historical issues were clarified, I had no more ideological concerns, and I was not subjected to any discrimination in my work. I was even elected as an advanced producer. I got married last year, and my wife also works in the cooperative." Liu Yushan from the Sixteenth Cotton Weaving Cooperative said, "In the past, there were counter-revolutionaries in our cooperative causing trouble, and the work was not going well. After the counter-revolutionary suppression campaign, the cooperative was consolidated. If there were no ulterior motives, how could one say that 'the counter-revolutionary suppression campaign was meddling'?"

　　劳动人民当中没有右派言论容身之地
    手工业者坚决跟着共产党走
    本报讯　北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社，于昨天下午邀请二十九位基层社干部和社员座谈。参加座谈的人都以不同的经历，反驳了右派分子的谎言。他们有一个共同的结论，就是坚决跟着共产党走！坚决反对右派分子。这个坚定不移的呼声，代表了全市十万零四千名手工业者的意志。
    北京市妇女挑花生产合作社社员白淑兰说，我是个家庭妇女，没有文化。我八岁学挑花，十七岁结婚以后，还是做挑花，解放前，不用说找不到活干，就是有点活做，赚到的钱，也不够吃饭。因此只得到街头讨饭吃。我生下的第一个孩子，就是背在街头讨饭冻死了的；第二个孩子也是因为没有钱给他诊病，瞪着眼睛看他死了的。那时候，我们这样的人，搭个棚在城里住，国民党都要把我们赶出城去，说是我们不讲卫生。那个时候，谁把我们当人看啊！解放了，我们好了，1952年入了社，生活便天天提高了。过去结婚十年没有买过一寸布，现在全家五口都穿上了新衣服；过去十年没有买过一毛钱的肉，现在经常可以吃饺子了。近来我每月还能剩下几块钱，已经有八十多元存款在银行里了。过去我这种人一钱不值，现在当选了联社的劳动模范、市政协委员和妇女代表，叫我怎么不乐呢？她最后说，我们挑花社八千多个妇女，坚决反对右派分子，坚决跟着共产党走，叫那些说人民生活降低的右派分子，到合作社来看看吧！
    好几个老年社员，都拿自己的经历和切身体会，说明了手工业工人的生活，比解放前提高得太多了。都说如果不是共产党的领导，我们手工业者那有今天的幸福生活。说生活降低了，真是没有良心。第一象牙社社员——著名的象牙雕刻艺人杨士惠说，我是从小就在北京的，在日本统治时期，街上那天不饿倒人，我们经常吃杂合面，我吃了肚子就不好。在日本投降后，我们手工艺人，也要过年才能吃顿白面饺子，那能像现在这样丰衣足食呢？右派分子说是不要共产党领导，难道要蒋介石回来吗？雕漆社老艺人董茂林说，我是个残废人，十五岁学雕漆，解放前连饭都吃不上，只幸得没有饿死；解放后组织了合作社，吃饭就有保证了。到1955年，我四十九岁了，还结了婚，去年又生了个儿子。这真是一辈子没有想到过的事，解放几年都来到了。五金铝品社马升麟说，右派分子所说的“人民”只能代表地主恶霸和官僚买办，根本不能代表我们劳动人民，因此只能得到台湾的喝采。第一食品社黄嘉生说，右派分子发言的用意，是要我们再过牛马不如的生活。第三呢绒社王世荣说，右派分子要取消共产党的领导，就等于要我们劳动人民的命。
    去年组成的第六纸盒社理事主任钟仲石说，右派分子说什么“党天下”，我不是党员、团员，从开始组织合作社就当选了理事主任，储安平也不是共产党员，怎么也做了光明日报的头头？我们社里都是烈军属和贫苦市民，过去像蚂蚁一样在社会上那有什么地位？现在不止是生活有保障，我们妇女也能管理国家的大事。右派分子说“党天下”，我们说是劳动人民的天下。我们社里的同志都说，没有共产党就没有今天。
    第三珐琅社会计许其仁，过去在国民党军队中当过副连长和警察中队长，在肃反运动中是肃反的对象，他以亲身的体会，反驳了所谓“肃反搞糟了”和“肃反是庸人自扰”的谎言。他说，我的历史问题弄清以后，思想顾虑没有了，在工作上也没有受到任何歧视，还选我作先进生产者。去年我结了婚，老婆也在合作社。第十六棉织社刘玉山说：我们社里过去有反革命分子捣蛋，工作搞不好，经过肃反以后，社才巩固起来，不是别有用心，怎能说“肃反是庸人自扰？”
