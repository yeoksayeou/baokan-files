    Doing a Good Job in Handling Letters and Visits from the People is of Great Significance
    Overcoming Bureaucracy; Mediating Internal Contradictions
    General Office of the CPC Central Committee and General Office of the State Council Hold Meeting to Discuss
    (Our dispatch) The General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly convened a meeting on handling letters and visits from the people. Starting on May 28th, after four days of discussion, it concluded on the 31st. Participants included party secretaries and secretaries-general from twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, governors and deputy governors (or mayors) of people's committees, and heads of various ministries (commissions) and directly subordinate institutions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, totaling more than 300 people. Yang Shangkun, Director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, and Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, delivered reports at the opening and closing of the meeting, respectively.
    This meeting focused on resolving the issues of understanding and leadership regarding the work of handling letters and visits. It also addressed some issues related to work methods.
    The meeting first emphasized the important significance of handling letters and visits from the people in the current situation. The meeting believed that when the people submit opinions and requests to the Party and the government through letters and visits, it is a way for them to realize their democratic rights. Party and government organs can expand their connections with the people by handling letters and visits. They can explain and promote the policies of the Party and the government to the people and can enable the Party and the government to understand and mediate internal contradictions among the people in a timely manner. In the recent period, the vast majority of issues reflected in the letters from the people received by Party and government organs at all levels across the country are related to internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, doing a good job in handling letters and visits from the people is of great significance for resolving internal contradictions among the people. The work of handling letters and visits is by no means a trivial matter, but an important political task, and Party committees at all levels, people's committees at all levels, and all organs and organizations must attach importance to and do this work well.
    At the meeting, representatives from various regions and organs reported that in the past, those organs that had a relatively correct understanding of this work and whose leaders attached importance to it had achieved relatively good results. Shao Shiping, Governor of Jiangxi Province, has personally received visiting masses every Thursday for the past four years, regardless of the weather. Several governors of Henan Province have also taken turns receiving visiting masses. They personally resolved some relatively important cases, leaving a good impression on the masses and prompting many local organs to attach greater importance to the work of handling letters and visits.
    However, representatives from various regions and organs also reflected another situation: the leaders of more Party and government organs still lack sufficient understanding of the important significance of this work. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings in the work of handling letters and visits from the people. The shortcomings in handling letters from the people are particularly serious. Some Party and government leaders rarely handle important letters and visits personally. Some places have accumulated a large number of letters that are not handled in a timely manner, and some even lose a large number of letters. In a certain district of Junan County, Shandong Province, the higher-level organs transferred eleven letters to them, and an inspection found that ten of them were neither processed nor their whereabouts known. Some places appear to be doing a good job on the surface, but in reality, they are simply "copying and forwarding, and not caring after sending it out the door." Therefore, at some recent symposiums convened by the Central Committee and various regions, some people have also made sharp criticisms of the shortcomings in this work. The meeting believed that the primary reason for these phenomena is that the rapid development of the revolutionary situation and changes in living environment have also caused changes in the thinking of cadres in some Party and government organs. The mass viewpoint of many people has gradually weakened, and the ideological style of subjectivism, sectarianism, and especially bureaucracy, has grown more than before. Another reason is that some central organs (including some national newspapers) have not provided enough assistance to lower levels, have underestimated their difficulties, and have set excessively hasty and rigid requirements for the tasks assigned to them. Some frequently require lower levels to report the handling results of a certain letter within a few days, but by the time the lower level receives the letter, the deadline has already passed. Some places sometimes receive several letters from higher-level organs at the same time asking them to "immediately send people down to investigate," putting their daily work in a passive position.
    Based on the requirements of the objective situation for the work of handling letters and visits, and the existing problems in the current work of handling letters and visits, the meeting decided that the work of handling letters and visits in each province (city, autonomous region) should, from now on, be managed separately by a secretary of the provincial (municipal) Party committee and the governor or deputy governor (or mayor) of the province (city) according to the Party and government systems. In each central ministry, it should be managed personally by a minister. The list should be reported to the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council in June, according to the Party and government systems. Their tasks are: to lead the institutions that handle letters and visits from the people; to directly handle some important letters and visits; and to submit important issues reflected in the letters and visits from the people to the leading organs for research and resolution. In the future, letters received by central organs should not be forwarded downwards if they should be handled directly. Those that should be handled by local authorities may be directly transferred to the county in a small number of cases, but generally they should be transferred to the province (city, autonomous region) so that the provincial (city, autonomous region) level organs can understand the situation and strengthen the inspection and supervision of the handling of these letters. Transfer procedures should generally be completed within three to seven days after receiving the letter. Regarding letters and visits accusing cadres, in the future, whichever level of organ manages the cadre, that level of organ will be responsible for handling it. However, there have been many cases of retaliation when letters accusing grassroots cadres below the county level were transferred to grassroots organizations for handling in the past. In the future, all such cases will be handled directly by the county-level organs. Letters accusing Party member cadres will be submitted to the county Discipline Inspection Committee of the Party, and letters accusing non-Party cadres will be submitted to the county People's Committee. For accumulated letters and unresolved issues in letters and visits, a general cleanup should be carried out immediately, and cadres can also be temporarily transferred if necessary. When handling problems, it is necessary to get rid of being passive and strive for initiative: those requests that are reasonable and can be handled in a timely manner must be handled. In order to do this work well, the meeting also decided to strengthen the institutions that handle letters and visits from the people, strengthen the allocation of cadres in terms of quality and quantity, and improve various systems. And it is necessary to strengthen the education on the mass viewpoint for full-time cadres engaged in this work, so that they can become active, enthusiastic, patient, and meticulous model mass workers.
    The meeting also decided that each province (city, autonomous region) should, in accordance with the spirit of this meeting and in light of the local specific circumstances, convene local meetings on the work of handling letters and visits, earnestly inspect the bureaucracy in the work of handling letters and visits, and take effective measures to strengthen leadership and improve work.

    作好人民来信来访工作有重大意义
    克服官僚主义　调节内部矛盾
    中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅开会讨论
    本报讯　中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅联合召开的处理人民来信、来访工作会议，从5月28日开始，经过四天的讨论，于31日闭幕。参加这次会议的有二十七个省、自治区、直辖市党委书记、秘书长，人民委员会的省长、副省（市）长或秘书长，以及中共中央和国务院各部（委）、各直属机构的负责人等共三百多人。中共中央办公厅主任杨尚昆、国务院秘书长习仲勋，在会议开幕、闭幕的时候，分别作了报告。
    这次会议，着重解决的是对来信、来访工作的认识问题和领导问题，同时也解决了些工作方法问题。
    会议首先强调说明了当前处理人民来信、接待人民来访的重要意义。会议认为，人民群众通过来信、来访，向党和政府提出意见和要求，是人民群众实现民主权利的一种方式。党和政府机关通过处理人民来信、来访，可以扩大同人民群众的联系，可以向人民群众解释、宣传党和政府的政策，可以使党和政府及时了解和调节人民内部矛盾。最近一个时期，全国各地各级党政机关所受理的人民来信，反映的问题绝大部分都是有关人民内部矛盾的。因此，作好人民来信、来访工作，对于解决人民内部矛盾，具有重要的意义；来信、来访工作，绝对不是一件小事，而是一项重要的政治任务，各级党委、各级人民委员会和所有的机关、团体，都必须重视和做好这一工作。
    会上，据各地、各机关的代表反映，过去，凡是对此项工作有比较正确的认识，领导人又比较重视此项工作的机关，工作就作得比较有成绩。江西省省长邵式平，四年来，风雨无阻地于每星期四亲自接见来访的群众，河南省的几个省长，也都轮流接见来访群众。他们亲自解决了一些比较重要的案件，给群众留下了良好的印象，也促使当地许多机关更加重视来信、来访工作。
    但是，各地、各机关的代表也反映了另一方面的情况：更多的党政机关的领导人，对于这项工作的重要意义还是认识不足的。所以，处理人民来信、来访的工作，还存在着不少缺点。在处理人民来信工作中的缺点，尤为严重。有些地方的党政机关领导人，平时极少亲自处理重要来信、来访，有的地方积压了大批来信，不及时处理，有的甚至把大批信件丢失。山东省莒南县的一个区，上级机关转给他们十一件信，据检查有十件既未处理，也不知下落。有的地方，表面上看来，这项工作作得还不错，实际上却是“照抄照转，出门不管”。因此，在最近中央和各地召开的一些座谈会上，也有人对这项工作中的缺点，提出了尖锐的批评。会议认为，造成这些现象的首要原因在于：革命形势的迅速发展，生活环境的变化，在一些党政机关干部的思想上，也引起了变化。许多人的群众观点渐渐地减弱了，主观主义、宗派主义，特别是官僚主义的思想作风，比从前滋长了。再一个原因是：一些中央机关（包括全国性的一些报纸）对下面帮助不够，对他们的困难估计不足，而对于下交的任务，却规定得过急、过死。有的经常要求下边在几天以内报告某一件信的处理结果，但是，下面收到这件信时，已经过了限期。有的地方，有时同时收到几件上级机关要他们“立即派人下去调查”的信件，使他们的日常工作陷于被动。
    根据客观形势对来信、来访工作的要求，以及当前来信、来访工作中存在的问题，会议决定：各省（市、自治区）的来信、来访工作，今后要按照党政系统分别由一位省（市）委书记和省（市）长或副省（市）长亲自掌管；中央各部由一位部长亲自掌管。名单要在6月份内按照党政系统分别报告中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅。他们的任务是：领导处理人民来信、来访的机构；直接处理一部分重要的来信、来访；把人民来信、来访中反映的重要问题，提交领导机关研究、解决。今后，中央机关收到的信件，凡是应该直接处理的，不要下转。应该由地方处理的，少数可以直接转交到县，一般的要转至省（市、自治区），以便省（市、自治区）级机关了解情况，加强对这些信件处理的检查监督。转办手续，一般要在收到信件后的三天到七天内办理完毕。关于控告干部的来信、来访，今后凡是那一级机关管理的干部，就由那一级机关负责处理。但是，控告县级以下基层干部的信件，过去转到基层组织处理时，发生的打击报复事件较多，今后一律由县级机关直接处理。控告党员干部的交党的县监察委员会，控告党外干部的交县人民委员会。对于积压的信件，和来信来访中没有处理的问题要立即普遍进行一次清理，必要时也可以临时抽调干部。在处理问题时，要摆脱被动，争取主动：凡是要求合理，而又有条件及时处理的，一定要加以处理。为了作好这些工作，会议还决定，要加强处理人民来信、来访的机构，从质量和数量上加强干部配备，健全各项制度。并且要对作此项工作的专职干部，加强群众观点的教育，使他们能够成为积极、热情、耐心、细致的模范的群众工作者。
    会议还决定，各省（市、自治区）应该根据这次会议的精神，结合当地的具体情况，召开地方来信、来访工作会议，切实检查来信来访工作中的官僚主义，并且采取有效措施，加强领导、改进工作。
