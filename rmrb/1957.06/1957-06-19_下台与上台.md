Stepping Down and Stepping Up
　　Zhang Ming
　　It seems that the right-wing elements who are attacking the Communist Party this time have a very complete set of strategies and tactics. Their articles start with "only mentioning shortcomings, not talking about achievements," first describing everything after liberation as "pitch black" and "terrible," and after a mix of narration and commentary, they draw a conclusion: "The Communist Party has reached a moment of crisis." How to break through and escape this crisis? With a turn of the pen, they put forward a set of plans: "Party rule" is not good, "things cannot be done just by the decision of the Communist Party," a political design institute should be established, or an upper house and a lower house. Then, spring clouds unfold again, and the finishing touch appears: "Coalition government," or "alternating rule by various parties," in short, to let the Communist Party "step down."
　　Some people say that people like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are all ministers at the central level, don't they count as being on stage? The answer is: you underestimate the ambitions of these gentlemen too much. What they want is not just the power of one ministry, but the power of the entire country. Therefore, they are calculating to develop the democratic parties to ten million. At that time, "there will always be a day when they will invite me to be the premier."
　　If it were just for one person's position, it would not be surprising at all, because the Constitution stipulates that even the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, who has the power to appoint and remove the Premier, has the right to be elected by "any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has the right to vote and be elected and is over the age of thirty-five." The issue here is not who becomes the Chairman or who becomes the Premier, but who with what kind of thinking will lead this country, and in what direction will this country be led. So, let us take a look at the political programs of those right-wing gentlemen who want the Communist Party to step down. They oppose centralization and advocate "democracy," oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, demand "freedom" for the bourgeoisie, oppose the planned economy, and demand an unlimited free market – to put it bluntly, it is to abandon the leadership of the Communist Party and abandon the socialist road. Isn't this a direct "violation of the constitution"? Isn't this an open challenge to the general program of the constitution? Can we turn a blind eye, refrain from criticizing and stopping such illegal remarks and plans?
　　Who should step down and who should step up, the decision lies with the people, not with a handful of ambitious people. Look, just revealing a little bit of "ambition" to step up has already resulted in a bloody nose and a swollen face, hasn't it?

### 下台与上台

　　下台与上台
　　张明
    看来，这次向共产党进攻的右派分子有一套很完备的策略和战术。他们的文章先从“只提缺点，不讲成绩”做起，先把解放后的一切描写成“黑漆一团”、“糟糕透顶”，夹叙夹议之余，自己得出一条结论：“共产党已经到了面临危机的时候”。如何突破和脱出这个危机呢？笔锋一转，就提出了一套方案：“党天下”不行，“不能共产党内决定了就干”，要成立政治设计院，或者上议院、下议院，接着，春云再展，出现了画龙点睛之笔：“联合政府”，或者“各党派轮流执政”，简言之，要共产党“下台”。
    有人说，章伯钧罗隆基辈都是中央级的部长，难道还不算也在台上么？答曰：你把这些先生们的雄心估计得太小了，他们要的不只是一个部的权，而是整个国家的权，所以他们盘算着，把民主党派发展到一千万，那时候，“总有一天会请我当总理吧”。
    假如单单是为了一个人的职位，那倒一点也不值得惊奇，因为宪法规定，连有任免总理之权的中华人民共和国主席，“有选举权和被选举权的年满三十五岁的中华人民共和国公民”谁都有被选的权利，这里的问题不在于谁当主席、谁当总理，而在于让具有什么思想的人来领导这个国家，和把这个国家带到什么方向。那么，让我们来看看那些要共产党下台的右派先生们的政治纲领吧，他们反对集中，赞成“民主”，反对人民民主专政，要求资产阶级“自由”，反对计划经济，要求无限制的自由市场，——拆穿来说，就是不要共产党领导，不要走社会主义的道路。这不是直接的“违宪”、这不是公开的对宪法总纲的挑战么？对这种违法的言论和策划，可以熟视无睹、不加批驳和制止么？
    要什么人下台、要什么人上台，决定权在于人民，而不在于一小撮野心分子。看吧，才透露出一点要上台的“雄心”，不就已经弄得鼻青脸肿了么？
