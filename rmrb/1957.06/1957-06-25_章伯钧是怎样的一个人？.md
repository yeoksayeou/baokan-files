　　What Kind of Person is Zhang Bojun?
　　Chen Qiyuan
    I have known Zhang Bojun for ten years (from 1947 to 1957). My impression of him is that he is a schemer and ambitious figure who specializes in playing double-dealing tricks, a "party-building" figure of a bourgeois political party, and he reveals a vicious attitude of hatred towards the Chinese Communist Party everywhere. His history is "built on anti-communism." Below, I recall a few things to illustrate what kind of person Zhang Bojun is with facts.
    In April 1948, I met Zhang Bojun at Peng Zemin's home in Hong Kong. When we talked about the recovery of Yan'an and the liberation of many important cities in Northeast China and Shandong, Mr. Peng and I were very happy, believing that the collapse of the Chiang regime was imminent and the day of the liberation of all China was not far away. Zhang Bojun replied: "Well, I think it will always be a compromise. If Mao Zedong is smarter, it's better to make peace!" Zhang Bojun's mood of not wanting to see the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, but wanting to fish in troubled waters through so-called "peace talks," was unconsciously revealed.
    Once, Zhang Bojun asked me seemingly sincerely: "What do you think of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party?" I said: I am not a member of your party and it is not appropriate to criticize, but since you asked, I must tell you. The Chinese Communist Party is the party of the working class. Your party is called the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. It seems that your party is a party led by the peasant class leading the working class. What are the boundaries? How many farmers do you represent? Zhang Bojun strongly disagreed and asked me: "How many hundreds of millions of farmers are there in China? Can the Communist Party get them all?" It can be seen that Zhang Bojun had already established a program of sharing the world equally with the Communist Party and "striving for the leadership of the peasantry."
    In Hong Kong, in order to expand his political capital, Zhang Bojun indiscriminately recruited party members. Even some Trotskyites, Communist Party traitors, secret agents (only in Dat Tat College, Zhang Juechu, Zhou Bogang, etc. were found) and suspicious elements were mixed into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. I asked him why he was so indiscriminate? Zhang Bojun replied: "In such a big trend, let them live and die on their own." Zhang Bojun pulled in party members everywhere, originally to carry his sedan chair. After he climbed up, he told people to "live and die on their own." Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching said: "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and regard all things as straw dogs." Zhang Bojun is "the party leader is not benevolent, and regards party members as straw dogs." He openly adopted such base, vile, and cruel methods towards the members of the political group he organized.
    In 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the Outline Land Law of China. Zhang Bojun expressed his opposition at the "South China Democratic Parties Symposium" in Hong Kong.
    Zhang Bojun was obsessed with the American bicameral system and often promoted the bourgeois fallacy of the "upper house." He said that the representatives of the People's Congress should be people who are detached from production and specialize in politics. In other words, he looked down on representatives from workers and peasants, thinking that workers and peasants did not understand politics, and only he understood politics.
    Some people suspect that Zhang Bojun only said some things against the leadership of the Communist Party and against socialism at the symposiums. Is it too heavy a punishment? I think it depends on what position you take. If you take a capitalist position, of course you think it is heavy, but if you take a socialist position, it is not too heavy, but too light. Zhang Bojun has long opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the people's democratic dictatorship with a set of "theories," programs, and actions. This is a struggle between two lines. We must thoroughly expose the details of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping... and their ilk, so that people can understand whether the daily actions of these ambitious people are beneficial or harmful to the people? How did he say nice things like "supporting the Communist Party" and "deeply ashamed" in person, while behind his back and in his heart, he hated the Communist Party and the people. This is the time for democratic people to draw a clear line with the rightists like Zhang Bojun.

　　章伯钧是怎样的一个人？
　　陈其瑗
    我和章伯钧相识十年（从1947年——1957年），他给我的印象是一个专玩弄两面手法的阴谋家和野心家，是一个资产阶级政党的“搞党”人物，对于中国共产党处处流露出恶毒的仇视态度，他的历史是“靠反共起家”。下面我回忆起几件事情，用事实来说明章伯钧是怎样的一个人。
    1948年4月，我在香港彭泽民家见到了章伯钧，谈起延安光复，东北、山东许多重要城市解放的新闻，彭老和我很高兴，认为蒋政权坍台在即，全中国解放的日子不远了。章伯钧答：“嗯，我看始终是和局。如果毛泽东聪明一些，还是和好！”章伯钧不愿看见中国共产党的胜利，而靠所谓“和局”去混水摸鱼的心情不觉暴露了出来。
    有一次，章伯钧好似诚心诚意地问我：“你对农工民主党的看法如何？”我说：我不是你党的人，不便批评，既承下问，不得不告。中国共产党是工人阶级的政党，你党叫农工民主党，好像你党是农民阶级领导工人阶级的政党，其界限如何？究竟代表多少农民？章伯钧大不以为然，反问我：“中国有几亿农民，共产党要得了吗？”可见，章伯钧早已立下与共产党平分秋色，“争取农民领导权”的纲领。
    章伯钧在香港为了扩大政治资本，滥收党员，甚至有些托派，共产党叛徒，特务分子（仅在达德学院就发现有张觉初、周伯刚等）和可疑分子都混进了农工民主党。我问他为什么要这样滥？章伯钧答：“在这样大潮流里，让他们自生自灭好了。”章伯钧到处拉党员，原来是为他抬轿，他爬上去之后，就叫人“自生自灭”。老子道德经说过：“天地不仁，以万物为刍狗”，章伯钧是“党魁不仁，以党员为刍狗”。他对于自己所组织的政治集团成员，公然采取了多么卑污下流和忍心害理的手段。
    1947年中共中央公布了中国土地法大纲，章伯钧在香港“华南民主党派座谈会”上表示反对。
    章伯钧醉心美国的两院制，经常宣扬“上议院”的资产阶级谬论。说人民代表大会的代表，应该是由脱离生产的专搞政治的人物来担任，这也就是说，他看不起来自工农中间的代表，认为工农不懂政治，他才懂政治。
    有人怀疑，章伯钧只在座谈会上说了一些反对共产党的领导、反对社会主义的话，是不是打得太重了？我以为站在什么立场来看，站在资本主义立场来看，当然以为重，但站在社会主义立场来看，不是太重而是太轻了。章伯钧长期以来反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度，反对人民民主专政有一套“理论”、政纲和行动。这是两条路线的斗争，必须深入地揭露章伯钧、储安平……之流的底细，才能使人明白这些野心家整天的所作所为，是对人民有利还是对人民有害？他是怎样当面说“拥护共产党”“深为惭悔”的好话，而背后和心里又怎样仇视共产党，仇视人民。这是民主人士对章伯钧之流的右派划清界限的时候。
