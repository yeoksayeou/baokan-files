　　The United States Should Remember the Lessons of its Defeat in the Korean War
    Seven years ago today, on June 25, 1950, American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea. American imperialism vainly attempted to seize all of Korea and turn it into a military base for further aggression against China. But this despicable plan completely failed. The heroic Korean people, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, after more than three years of heroic fighting, dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, drove them back to where they started their aggression, and forced them to sit down and negotiate, finally achieving a great victory in realizing the Korean armistice.
    The failure of the United States to invade Korea is a living proof of the complete bankruptcy of the so-called "policy of strength" pursued by the United States throughout the world. This failure of the United States is one of the most significant international events with far-reaching impact since the war. This event showed the tremendous change in the balance of power between the forces of peace and the forces of war in the post-war world. The Korean War proved that the imperialist forces of war are not to be feared, and that the people who fight for their independence, freedom, and national sovereignty are invincible. The Korean War taught the imperialists a costly lesson. At the same time, it greatly encouraged the confidence and courage of peace-loving people all over the world and the people fighting for their national independence.
    The victory of the Korean people against American aggression has brought about a certain degree of relaxation of the tense situation created by the United States in Asia. The achievement of the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue is the result of this relaxation. After the realization of the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese people made tremendous efforts to realize the terms of the armistice and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, in order to further ease the Asian situation. However, these efforts by the Korean and Chinese people have been stubbornly obstructed and sabotaged by the United States. The American aggressor bloc has not learned the lessons it should have from the failure of the Korean War. On the contrary, it still attempts to create tension in Asia with its already bankrupt so-called "policy of strength," in order to expand its aggressive forces and prepare for new wars of aggression. The United States has tried its best to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea at the Geneva Conference, refused to withdraw its troops from South Korea, and has continuously violated the armistice agreement in Korea, expanding and strengthening the armed forces of the Syngman Rhee clique. The United States still occupies China's Taiwan, which it seized at the beginning of the Korean War. After the achievement of the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue, the United States immediately organized the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," an aggressive military bloc, and replaced France in South Vietnam. At the same time, the United States openly declared that it would take South Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam as three fronts for aggression against China.
    But even so, under the impetus of peace-loving people all over the world, the Asian situation, like the entire international situation, is still developing in the direction of relaxation through tortuous paths. This makes the American aggressor bloc very uneasy. In a recent period, the United States has been actively building atomic weapons bases in Asia and around the world, threatening the people of all countries with atomic weapons, in order to obstruct the easing of the situation and continue to pursue its policy of aggression and war preparation.
    The United States has already turned Japan and China's Taiwan into its atomic weapons bases, and now it is openly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, attempting to turn South Korea into an atomic weapons base as well. The United States has decided to immediately ship the first batch of new weapons into South Korea as the first step in its serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This perfidious act by the United States is part of its conspiracy to intensify the tense situation in the Far East. This behavior is absolutely intolerable to the people of Korea and China, and it is also absolutely intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. Any reason the United States uses to defend its illegal actions is untenable. The Korean Armistice Agreement is a complete international agreement, and it must continue to be fully effective. If any part of the agreement is violated, it may have the most serious consequences. The United States must now immediately stop its destructive actions and abide by all the terms of the armistice agreement. Otherwise, the United States must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.
    The American aggressor bloc should not forget the lessons of the failure of the Korean War. At this time seven years ago, the American aggressors thought that as long as they displayed American planes and cannons, the Korean people would flee in panic, and the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea would be theirs for the taking. But what was the result? Weren't those American troops who once thought they were invincible the ones who fled in disgrace? Now, the United States again fantasizes that it can scare the Korean people with atomic weapons. But fantasy can never become reality, and the United States has once again made the serious mistake of underestimating the Korean people.
    The integrity and full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement are closely and inextricably linked to the maintenance and consolidation of peace in Korea, and maintaining peace in Korea is an extremely important link in maintaining world peace. Therefore, all those who care about world peace must resolutely oppose the perfidious behavior of the United States in undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, and must strive to maintain the integrity and full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

### 美国应当记取侵朝战争失败的教训

　　美国应当记取侵朝战争失败的教训
    七年以前的今天，1950年6月25日，美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争。美帝国主义妄想侵占全部朝鲜，把它变成进一步侵略中国的军事基地。但是这个卑鄙的打算完全落空了。英雄的朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军的支援之下，经过三年多的英勇奋战，给了侵略者以严重的打击，把它驱逐到了它发动侵略的地方，迫使它不能不坐下来谈判，最后取得了实现朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。
    美国侵略朝鲜的失败，是美国在全世界推行所谓“实力政策”彻底破产的活生生的证据。美国的这一失败，是战后具有深远影响的最重大的国际事件之一。这一事件显示了战后世界和平力量和战争势力之间的力量对比的巨大变化。朝鲜战争证明了帝国主义战争势力是并不可怕的，而为自己的独立、自由和民族主权而斗争的人民是不可战胜的。朝鲜战争给帝国主义者们上了代价惨重的一课。同时，它也大大鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民和为争取自己的民族独立而斗争的人民的信心和勇气。
    朝鲜人民反对美国侵略所取得的胜利，使得美国在亚洲制造的紧张局势得到了一定程度的和缓。关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的达成，就是局势和缓的结果。在朝鲜停战实现以后，朝鲜人民和中国人民为了进一步和缓亚洲局势，都曾经为实现停战条款以及和平解决朝鲜问题，作了巨大的努力。但是，朝中人民的这种努力，遭到了美国的顽固的阻挠和破坏。美国侵略集团并没有从侵朝战争的失败中获得应有的教训。相反地，它仍然企图凭借已经破产的所谓“实力政策”，在亚洲制造紧张局势，以便扩张侵略势力，准备新的侵略战争。美国在日内瓦会议上竭力阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，拒绝从南朝鲜撤退它的军队，并且在朝鲜不断违反停战协定，扩大和加强李承晚集团的武装力量。美国仍然一直占领着它在侵朝战争开始的时候侵占的中国的台湾。在关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议达成以后，美国立即组织了所谓“东南亚条约组织”的侵略性军事集团，并且在南越取代了法国的地位。同时，美国公开宣布要把南朝鲜、台湾和南越作为侵略中国的三条战线。
    但是，纵然如此，在全世界爱好和平的人民的推动下，亚洲局势同整个国际局势一样，仍然通过曲折的道路向着和缓的方向发展。这使美国侵略集团非常不安。在最近一个时期内，美国在亚洲和世界各地积极建立原子武器基地，对各国人民实行原子武器威胁，就是为了阻挠局势的缓和，以便继续推行它的侵略备战政策。
    美国已经把日本和中国的台湾变成了它的原子武器基地，现在又公然破坏朝鲜停战协定，企图把南朝鲜也变成原子武器基地。美国已经决定立即把第一批新式武器运进南朝鲜，作为它严重地破坏朝鲜停战协定的第一个步骤。美国这个背信弃义的行为，是它在远东加剧紧张局势的阴谋的一部分。这种行为是朝、中两国人民绝对不能容忍的，也是全世界爱好和平的人民绝对不能容忍的。美国为它自己的非法行为辩护的任何理由，都是站不住脚的。朝鲜停战协定是一个完整的国际协议，它必须继续全部有效。协定的任何一部分如果遭到破坏，就有可能产生最严重的后果。美国现在必须立即停止它的破坏行为，遵守停战协定的全部条款。否则的话，美国对于由此引起的一切后果，必须担负全部责任。
    美国侵略集团不应该忘记侵朝战争失败的教训。七年以前的这个时候，美国侵略者曾经以为只要他们摆出美国的飞机大炮，朝鲜人民就会望风而逃，朝鲜的大好河山就是他们的囊中之物。但是，结果怎么样呢？逃得屁滚尿流的不就是那些曾经自以为不可一世的美国军队吗？现在，美国又幻想可以用原子武器把朝鲜人民吓倒。但是幻想决不能成为现实，美国又重犯了对朝鲜人民过低估计的严重错误。
    朝鲜停战协定的完整和全部实施，对朝鲜和平的保持和巩固有着密切不可分的关系，而维护朝鲜和平又是维护世界和平的极重要的一环。因此，一切关心世界和平的人，都不能不坚决反对美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的背信行为，都不能不为维护朝鲜停战协定的完整和全部实施而奋斗。
