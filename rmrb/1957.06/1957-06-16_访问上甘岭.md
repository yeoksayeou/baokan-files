　　Visiting Shangganling
　　Feng Zheng

　　The much-lauded Shangganling actually refers to the two small highlands of Shangganling 597.9 and 537.7 North Hill, covering less than four square kilometers. In the early winter of 1952, our volunteer army annihilated more than 25,000 enemy soldiers in repelling the enemy's offensive against this position, thus making Shangganling a world-renowned heroic battleground.

　　To reach Shangganling from the foot of Mount Wu Sheng, one must first cross a hill fort and pass through a tunnel before entering the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The sentry of the civil police team checked our documents issued by the Armistice Commission and received us. The DMZ is separated by a barbed wire fence. On the hillside stands a yellow sign with the Chinese and Korean characters for "Northern Border of the Demilitarized Zone." South of the yellow sign, the ground is riddled with bomb craters, and the pine and maple trees destroyed by artillery fire are reduced to bare stumps pockmarked with bullet holes. Following the winding mountain path, stepping on the knee-deep snow, we reached a small basin surrounded by mountains on three sides. Springs emerged from the ice-covered foot of the mountains and converged into a small stream. About an arrow's distance downstream are two newly built thatched huts, which is Lower Shangganling. The actual Shangganling village is a little further past Lower Shangganling. We came to visit the heroic battleground and to comfort the heroic soldiers, so we headed directly towards Height 597.9.

　　The highlands of Shangganling were completely covered in deep snow, like a giant draped in a white cloak, overlooking the peaceful front line. The slope from the foot of the mountain to the summit is very steep, with one bomb crater after another. Some of the craters are nearly ten meters in diameter and, even though covered with thick snow, are still several feet deep. This is a trace of the enemy's intense artillery blockade during the Shangganling campaign. In the difficult days of the war, soldiers had to pass through this area to transport supplies and rescue the wounded. As we climbed the mountain, a slight carelessness would send us sliding into a bomb crater for a snow bath. My companions, like myself, seemed immersed in memories of the difficult days of the war, constantly recalling scenes from the film "Shangganling" of transporting supplies and fetching water. Sweat streamed from our heads and backs, soaking our underwear. We only stopped when we found several tunnel entrances in a steep area.

　　I had not been to this memorable place before. But I was already familiar with it through the words of countless heroes and the writings of journalists and writers. When the enemy repeatedly controlled the ridge of Shangganling, our tenacious and unyielding soldiers relied on entering and exiting these small tunnel entrances to counterattack the enemy and preserve this heroic position. From the tunnel entrance on the hillside to the foot of the mountain seemed to be only a couple of hundred meters, but how much blood was shed by our soldiers to obtain a little spring water at that time. We continued to climb, treading on the blood-soaked path opened by our heroes. The entire mountain was covered with scorched tree stumps and shattered rocks. The tree stumps were full of bullets and shrapnel; the mountain had been leveled by several meters, and the rocks were pulverized; but our volunteer army was not driven off the mountain, and our soldiers still stood firm on Shangganling. How proud we can be! Seeing and thinking of these things, my blood surged, and I felt a burst of energy from somewhere, and I rushed up in one breath.

　　As we approached the summit, more than ten civil police soldiers wearing red armbands ran out of a thatched shed to greet us.

　　"Comrades, you've worked hard!" I hurried to them, taking two steps at a time, and greeted them breathlessly.

　　"Serve the people! For the motherland! For peace!"

　　Before the soldiers finished speaking, they took turns shaking my hand with both hands. From their sincere and joyful expressions, I could see how eagerly they looked forward to people from the motherland!

　　I wiped my head and forehead, which felt as if I had just emerged from a pond. I felt very relaxed. All fatigue seemed to have disappeared. In the snow-covered and frozen mountains, I felt no cold at all.

　　Surrounded by the soldiers, I walked into their barracks. The barracks were divided into inner and outer rooms, with a stove made from a gasoline drum. Next to the stove, on a table made from canned food boxes, were copies of "Liberation Army Warrior," various comic books, and newspapers. There were also tattered playing cards that had been mended with paper. On the walls, made of kudzu vine and plastered with yellow mud, hung portraits of Chairman Mao, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and Marshal Peng Dehuai, and a familiar New Year picture of a child wearing a red scarf and holding a dove of peace with the caption "Defend Peace." This was the "home on the front" that the soldiers had built after moving out of the tunnels. I was curiously admiring the soldiers' creations when a soldier brought over a bowl of plain water. It was wonderful, and I drank it all in one gulp, then another bowl. In an instant, it tasted so sweet. I couldn't help but say, "The water is so sweet!" The soldiers all laughed. A soldier with a Sichuan accent said, "The water in Korea is sweet to begin with, and the water in Shangganling is even sweeter. It's our water company's top product!"

　　Hmm! What bragging, where did a water company come from here? I thought secretly, smiling. The soldier seemed to notice my dubious expression and pulled me to the door, pointing to a flat slope not far away and said, "Look, that's our water company." I looked intently, and indeed. On a stone cliff was a long iron pipe, and spring water flowed continuously from the ice cone at the front of the pipe into an iron bucket. Comrade Zhao Zuoshan, the squad leader of the civil police team stationed on this position after the war, told me, "In the past, we didn't carry water from the foot of the mountain. We collected it from the tunnels with bowls. The soldiers came up with a way to insert a pipe into the spring, and the water flowed out along the pipe. It's real running water! Now, the problem of cooking and drinking water is solved. If we use it sparingly, there's no problem with bathing and washing clothes!" I admired the soldiers' wisdom and creativity from the bottom of my heart and shook hands again with the Sichuan soldier who had introduced me to this situation. His name was Chen Shunfu, twenty-one years old, a sturdy young man with a dark red, round face and piercing eyes.

　　Together with Captain Zhao, I walked along the jade-like, ice-covered path to the main peak of Height 597.9. Turning around, I saw the majestic Mount Wu Sheng towering. My excited mood flew through the vast wilderness to my beloved motherland. At my feet was the world-renowned heroic battleground, and beneath the snow-covered tree stumps and the clusters of newly sprouted maple trees were the blood of countless heroes such as Huang Jiguang, Sun Zhanyuan, Niu Baocai, Zhu Youguang, and Wang Wancheng. At this moment, the swirling goose-feather snow, driven by the storm from the sea, disappeared into the sacred mountains of North Korea. North of our DMZ, all was a vast expanse of spring snow, a scene of ten thousand miles of peace. Turning to the south, under the steep Shangganling, more than a meter of thick snow could not hide the overgrown weeds, broken steel everywhere, and barbed wire covered with rust and various landmines and iron cylinders. Looking from Shangganling to the Jinhua Plain, a terrifying stillness enveloped South Korea, resembling the no-man's-land during the Anti-Japanese War. Suddenly, from behind Mount Jixiong on the opposite side, came the rumble of artillery fire, and two "oil carriers" rattled across the sky above the DMZ. Captain Zhao told me, "This is the US-ROK army conducting military exercises. They are clamoring for a northward advance every day and are stepping up war preparations!" I clearly realized that this was the front line of the struggle between justice and violence, peace and war. Our volunteer army civil police soldiers are patrolling the line of military demarcation in the snow-deep, knee-high snow, guarding the line of peace.

　　On Shangganling, our soldiers have made many repairs and cleanups, but the traces of war are still clearly visible. Here, the young peaks have been cut into flat tops, and the sharp rocks have been ground into powder. But the tunnel fortifications dug by our soldiers with their blood and hands still stand on the top of the mountain, leading directly to the mountainside. Who can say that this is not a miracle in the history of human warfare?

　　With a heart full of reverence, I followed the winding path to a destroyed bunker, which was prominent in position and formed an obtuse angle with the main peak of the high ground. Dear friends, without asking, this is the familiar Zero Position, where the hero Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself to destroy the bunker. The snow-covered bunker, overgrown with white grass, was covered with the blood of martyrs. I devoutly took off my hat and silently mourned the martyrs who shed their blood here!

　　The soldiers treated us to lunch. We gathered around three porcelain basins. The dishes were rich, including a stir-fried greens with eggs and vermicelli, a tofu stewed with cabbage, and a stir-fried radish with chili peppers. I wondered where they got so many dishes from, and it seemed that they were specially prepared for us. Captain Zhao said with a smile, "You've come at the wrong time. When the cucumbers and tomatoes we grow in the summer and autumn are harvested, everyone picks and eats as they please. In Beijing, it might not be as convenient as eating vegetables here!" While eating, the soldiers also told me about their lives. They plan to harvest 70,000 catties of vegetables this year. The vegetable seeds have already been selected, and some soldiers have even asked for some hard-to-find seeds from their hometowns. Captain Zhao said, "Last year, we grew so many melons and vegetables that we couldn't eat them all, and we even sent some to the People's Army comrades. Last winter, we accumulated fertilizer and dredged the waterways. This year, we will also have a bumper harvest on the Korean front!" The soldiers are all loyal supporters of Captain Zhao's plan. They told me that Captain Zhao is from Luan County, Hebei, and is less than thirty years old this year. He joined the army at the end of the Anti-Japanese War. He volunteered to go to Korea in 1950 and has worked as a communicator, scout... and every other kind of "member". He is not only a good fighter but also a production expert. No wonder he speaks so knowledgeably about production!

　　The soldiers deeply miss their motherland and their loved ones. I chatted with them for the entire afternoon. As long as it was about the motherland, they asked about everything and wanted to know everything. They repeatedly asked me to send a message to the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao, saying that they would never fail the trust of the motherland. When the bright moonlight shone on Shangganling, I had to reluctantly bid farewell to these dear soldiers guarding the heroic battleground. Several off-duty soldiers escorted me all the way out of the DMZ. At the time of parting, the Sichuan soldier said affectionately to me, "Comrade, here are two negatives of my photos. Please take them back to the motherland to develop and help me send them to my home. My home is in Pengxi, Sichuan..." In addition, he took out five yuan Renminbi. I did not accept the money, but I accepted the negatives. I fully understand these soldiers who are far away from their homeland. I will tell the people of the motherland their loyalty to the motherland and their longing for their loved ones. (Attached picture)

    访问上甘岭
    冯征
    人们传颂的上甘岭，实际是指上甘岭597.9和537.7北山，两个不到四平方公里的狭小高地。1952年初冬，我志愿军某部在粉碎敌人对这一阵地的进攻中，曾取得了歼敌二万五千多名的巨大胜利。上甘岭因此而成为举世闻名的英雄阵地。
    从五圣山山脚走向上甘岭，要先翻过一个山堡，通过一个坑道，便进入非军事区。民警队的哨兵检查了停战委员会发给我们的证件，接待了我们。非军事区是被一道铁丝网隔绝起来的。半山坡竖着一个黄牌子，上写着“非军事区北沿”的中文和朝文字样。黄牌子以南，弹坑累累，被炮火摧毁了的松树和枫树，只剩下满是弹痕蜂眼的秃桩子。顺着蜿蜒的山道，踏着没膝的雪路，我们走到了一个三面环山的小盆地。泉流从冰封的山脚下爬了出来，汇成一条小溪。顺着小溪下去约一箭之地，有两间新搭起的草房，这就是下甘岭。真正上甘岭的山村，还在下甘岭过去一点。我们是为了访问英雄阵地和慰问英雄的战士们而来的，所以，直接就向597.9高地前进。
    上甘岭的高地，完全为深厚的雪所铺满，它像一个披着白色斗篷的巨人，俯瞰着和平的防线。从山脚到山顶，坡度很陡，弹坑一个连着一个。有的弹坑方圆约近十公尺，虽然复盖了厚雪，也还有几尺深。这是上甘岭战役中敌人炮火严密封锁的痕迹。在战争艰难的日子里，战士们运送东西，抢救伤员，都要通过这一地带。我们上山，稍一不小心，也会滑在弹坑里，洗一个大雪澡。同行的人，似乎都和我一样沉浸在对战争时期艰难的日子的回忆里，脑海里不断地浮现出影片上甘岭中运送东西和抢水的场面。汗从头上、背上止不住的流着，内衣早已溻湿了。直到我们在一个削绝地带发觉了几个坑道口的时候，才停了下来。
    过去我没有到过这个值得纪念的地方。但从多少英雄们的口中，从记者和作家的笔下早已熟悉了它。当敌人数度控制上甘岭山脊的时候，我们那些顽强不屈的战士们，凭借着并出入了这些小小的坑道口，去反击敌人，保全了这个英雄的阵地。从半山腰的坑道口到山脚，看来不过一二百公尺，但为了取得一点泉水，那时不知付出了多少战士的鲜血。我们踏着英雄们开拓的血路，继续上爬。满山尽是被烧焦了的秃树桩子和被打碎了的山岩。树桩子里满是弹头，钢片片；山被削平了几公尺，岩石被打得烂碎；但是我们的志愿军并没有被赶下山去，我们的战士仍然屹立在上甘岭。这是多么值得自豪的事啊！我看到和想到了这些，热血上涌，还不知从那里来了一股劲，一口气就冲了上去。
    接近山顶的时候，十多个带红袖章的民警战士，从一间茅棚中跑出来接我们。
    “同志们辛苦了！”我三步并成两步赶到他们面前，上气不接下气地向他们招呼。
    “为人民服务！为祖国！为和平！”
    战士们话未说完，就一个个轮流用双手来紧握我的手。从他们真挚喜悦的表情里，可以看出，他们多么殷切地盼望来自祖国的人！
    我擦了擦像是刚从池塘里钻出来的头和前额。心里十分宽畅。一切疲倦似乎都已消逝了。在雪封冰冻的山腰里，一点冷的感觉也没有。
    在战士们的拥簇下，我走进了他们的营房。营房分内外两间，生着一个用汽油桶改做的火炉子。暖炉一旁，用罐头箱子改造成的桌子上，放着解放军战士、各种各样的小人书和报纸。也有玩得破烂不堪用纸糊裱过的扑克牌。用葛藤编起、黄泥涂刷过的墙壁上，挂着毛主席、金日成元帅和彭德怀元帅的肖像，贴着一张我们所熟悉的一个带红领巾的孩子高擎着和平鸽的
  “保卫和平”的年画。这是战士们从坑道里搬出来之后，所建设的“阵地之家”。我正在好奇地欣赏着战士们的创造，一个战士捧过一碗白开水来。这真真好极了，我一口气就喝完了它，接着又干了一碗。一霎时，只觉得满口香甜。我便情不自禁地说：“好甜的水！”战士们都笑起来。一个操四川口音的战士说：“朝鲜的水本来就甜，上甘岭的水比别处更甜，这是我们自来水公司的上等产品！”
    唔！真牛皮，这里那来的自来水公司呢？我暗暗地想着、笑着。那个战士似乎觉察出我不以为然的神情来，便拉我到门口，指着不远的一块平坡说：“你看，那就是我们的自来水公司。”我定睛一看，果然不错。在一块石崖上真有一根长长的铁管子，泉水从管子前端的冰椎上不停地流向一个铁桶里。战后就在这个阵地上的民警队分队长赵佐山同志对我说：“过去喝水不从山下背，就从坑道里用碗接，战士们想了个法子，把一根管子插入了泉眼，泉水就顺着管子流出来了。真是自来水！现在，煮饭、喝水的问题都解决了。假如节省些用，洗澡、洗衣服也不成问题！”我从内心里钦佩战士们的智慧和创造，还特地和为我介绍这一情况的那个四川籍的战士再次握了握手。他叫陈顺富，二十一岁，是个黑红圆脸、目光炯炯的壮小伙子。
    我和赵队长一起，沿着玉石般的冰封的小道，走上五九七点九高地主峰。转身一望，但见雄伟壮丽的五圣山巍峨一片。我激动的心情，透过辽阔的天野，飞向亲爱的祖国。在我的脚下，就是举世闻名的英雄阵地，在那些被雪复盖着的树桩子的根部和一簇新生的枫树芽下，洒遍了黄继光、孙占元、牛保才、朱有光、王万成等无数英雄们的鲜血。此刻，旋舞着的鹅毛大雪，驾着来自海上的风暴，消逝在北朝鲜圣洁的山峦之中。在我方非军事区以北，全是白茫茫的春雪，万里和平景象。我转身向南望去，在陡峭的上甘岭下，一公尺以上的厚雪，还掩盖不住丛生的荒草，遍处是被摧毁了的破烂的钢铁，满是红锈的铁丝网上挂着各样的地雷和铁筒。从上甘岭向金化平川望去，一片恐怖的死静笼罩着南朝鲜，煞像是抗日战争时期的无人区。忽然，对面鸡雄山的背后，传来了隆隆的炮声，两架“油挑子”沿着非军事区上空轧轧飞过。赵队长告诉我说：“这是美李军在进行军事演习，他们天天叫嚷北进，在加紧战争准备！”我清楚地意识到这里就是正义对强暴、和平对战争斗争的前哨。我们志愿军民警队的战士们，正在雪深没膝的军事分界线上，巡视着和平的防线。
    上甘岭上，我们的战士作了多次的修整和打扫，但战痕依然清晰可见。这儿，年青的山峰已被削成平顶，锋锐的岩石被磨成粉末。但我军战士用心血和双手挖筑的坑道工事，却依然屹立山巅，直通山腰。谁敢说这不是人类战争史上的奇迹呢？
    我满怀崇敬的心情，顺着山蜒走向一个被炸毁了的碉堡，这里和高地主峰互为畸角，位置很突出。亲爱的朋友们，不用问，这就是大家所熟悉的○号阵地，英雄黄继光舍身炸碉堡的地方。在被雪掩盖了的长满白草的碉堡上，洒满了烈士们的鲜血。我虔诚地脱下了帽子，默默地悼念那些把鲜血洒在这里的烈士们！
    战士们招待我们吃午饭。我们分别围着三个磁盆。菜很丰富，一个青菜炒蛋粉，一个白菜熬豆腐，一个辣椒炒萝贝。我怀疑他们那里来的这么多菜，看来是专门招待我们的。赵队长笑着对我说：“现在你来的不是时候，等夏、秋天我们种的黄瓜、西红柿下来的时候，谁都是挑着吃。在北京，怕也不如我们这里吃菜方便呢！”边吃饭，战士们也向我介绍他们的生活。他们计划今年收七万斤菜，菜种子已经选好了，有些战士还专门从家乡要了些难找的菜籽来。赵队长说：“去年种的瓜和菜，自己吃不完，还送给人民军同志一些。去冬，我们积了肥，疏通了水道，今年我们要在朝鲜前线，也搞他个大丰收！”战士们都是赵队长计划的忠实拥护者。他们告诉我，赵队长是河北滦县人，今年不到三十岁，抗日战争末期参加了队伍。1950年志愿入朝，他当过通信员、侦察员……什么员都干过，不仅是个打仗好手，也是生产能手。无怪他说起生产来头头是道呢！
    战士们深深的怀念祖国，怀念亲人。我和他们整整聊了下半天，只要是关于祖国的事，他们什么都问，什么都想。他们再三地要我带信给祖国的人民和毛主席，说他们决不会辜负祖国的委托。当皎洁的月光照临上甘岭的时候，我才不得不和这些守卫在英雄阵地的亲爱的战士们依依惜别。有几个不值勤的战士，还一直把我送出非军事区，临别时，还是那个四川籍的战士亲切地对我说：“同志，这是我的两张照相底片，请你帮我带回祖国洗一洗，并帮我寄回家里去，我的家是四川蓬溪……”另外，他拿出五元人民币。钱我没有收，底片我收下了。我完全了解这些远离乡土的战士们。我要把他们忠于祖国和怀念亲人的心意，告诉给祖国人民。（附图片）
