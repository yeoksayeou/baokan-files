Xinhua News Agency, June 14th Special Dispatch: The leaders of eleven universities in the capital today gave preliminary self-criticism reports on the rectification issue at meetings of teachers, students, and staff in their respective schools.

　　At today's report meetings, the Party committee leaders of each school made self-criticisms on the prominent problems existing in their schools. While expressing gratitude to non-Party members who sincerely helped the Party in the rectification, they mentioned that although some people's criticisms were not comprehensive enough, their criticisms came entirely from good intentions, and therefore they also expressed their gratitude to them. At the same time, they also pointed out in their reports that a section of right-wing elements had made many anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and everyone should expose and criticize these reactionary remarks in the process of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "contending," to distinguish right from wrong, so as to help the Party carry out the rectification well.

　　He Xilin, Secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University, said: We have many shortcomings in our guiding ideology, work methods, and work style. We have not paid enough attention to the central tasks of the school, such as teaching, scientific research, and the training and improvement of teachers. The school leadership lacks a spirit of self-criticism, pride and complacency have grown among Party leading cadres, and democratic life within the Party is not sound enough. Mr. Liao Taichu said that "BSU has four difficulties: it is difficult to meet the leaders, it is difficult to have heart-to-heart talks, it is difficult to understand Party members, and it is difficult to get things done." This shows that we urgently need to strengthen ties with the masses and have more direct contact and heart-to-heart talks with veteran teachers.

　　He Xilin also reviewed the shortcomings of dogmatism in ideological work and failing to implement the instructions of higher authorities from a practical standpoint. He said: For example, regarding the internship issue, most department heads advocated one internship, but I did not consult them well and still insisted on two internships. On the issue of promoting lecturers, there was a tendency to rush ahead, and there were some shortcomings in strictly adhering to the principles of both ability and integrity, and giving equal importance to politics and professional skills. In last year's salary and grade evaluation work, we did not solicit the opinions of the masses widely and deeply enough, and we failed to accurately understand the professional work of teachers. The grades of a very small number of Party member teachers were set too high.

　　He Xilin said: Some of our Party members do not respect non-Party members enough, and in some respects, the relationship between the Party and the masses is not normal enough. Mr. Zhu Qingyong said that he only saw me at big reports, and Mr. Tai Shuangqiu said that there were "four walls" and "four layers of boards" between the Party and the masses, which shows that our phenomenon of being divorced from the masses is still serious.

　　He Xilin then reported on the school's efforts to rectify and reform simultaneously. He said that there were indeed some shortcomings in the work of promoting teaching assistants to lecturers. Some Party members have now taken the initiative to apply for demotion, and the Party Committee is prepared to submit the issue of the academic titles of four of them to the department and school administration for discussion and decision. On the issue of wages, some Party members were rated too high, and now, according to their own applications, the Party Committee will suggest that the school administration demote them by one level. The Party Committee has agreed that some Party leading cadres should return the unreasonable welfare benefits they received last year, and a five-person group has been formed to study the unreasonable allocation of dormitories.

　　He Xilin finally said: In the rectification, the vast majority of criticisms and opinions are good, and we must seriously accept and study them, and earnestly correct them. Although some opinions are one-sided and extreme, they are welcome because they are out of enthusiasm to help the Party in rectification. However, the opinions of a very small number of people are erroneous and reactionary, and they have deviated from the track of helping the Party in rectification, such as the saying of "the Party's world," and the like. Even before the speeches of Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, and others, some people in the school had already said this. These remarks are undoubtedly an attack on the Party. He said: Now the question is not whether to allow these remarks to be voiced, but to clarify right and wrong through "contending" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom."

　　Liu Jingxi, Secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, said that since the beginning of the rectification, teachers, students, and staff throughout the school have put forward many criticisms and opinions, most of which have greatly helped the Party's rectification. For example, Vice Dean Lei Jieqiong pointed out: Some issues of the school were not discussed with her enough, and some of the opinions she put forward were not followed up. In the past, Party member cadres were sometimes very rude. These opinions are all very good. Many teachers, students, and staff have also put forward very good criticisms of the situation of the relationship between the Party and the masses, the complexity of the school's institutions, and the redundancy of personnel. We should sincerely accept these opinions and improve them.

　　Liu Jingxi said that some of the opinions that everyone put forward are relatively easy to solve and are being solved. Some have already been solved, such as the subsidy fees of Deputy Party Secretary Guo Di and others have been declared to be returned; some problems must be solved after systematic research; some need to be requested from the relevant departments at the higher level before they can be solved; and some problems belong to the past where the situation was not explained enough, and it is necessary to explain the situation to everyone. He said that these problems, which belong to the Party, will be studied by the Party, and the administrative problems are recommended to be studied and handled by the school administration.

　　Liu Jingxi, on behalf of the Party Committee, expressed a sincere welcome to the criticisms and opinions put forward by everyone. He pointed out that as long as it is a well-intentioned criticism, even if it does not fully conform to the facts, or even has a big discrepancy, or the wording is sharp and irritating, we all think it is good. Because these opinions are all in recognition of the Party's leadership, care for the Party, and love for the Party, and are from the desire to do a good job in the people's cause. However, some people's opinions cannot be agreed with. It is not to help the Party in rectification, but to use the name of helping the Party in rectification to abolish the Party's leadership, carry out anti-Party activities, and attempt to squeeze the Party out. Therefore, it should be resolutely repelled. But opposing the rightists must not confuse the general incorrect opinions with the methods and attitudes of making suggestions that are not good. Liu Jingxi said that in order to distinguish right from wrong and deepen the blooming and contending, we are prepared to discuss some major issues on which there are inconsistent understandings among the many issues raised, so as to clarify our thinking. He gave an example, such as whether the college's implementation of the policy on intellectuals is wrong or correct, whether intellectuals should continue to conduct ideological remolding in the future; whether the college's work achievements since its establishment are mainly positive or mainly wrong, whether the school's policy is correct or wrong; whether the college's party organization is a sectarian group; whether it is now "the Party's world"; whether political conditions should be emphasized in the selection of cadres; whether there should be a reporting system within the Party; whether the secrets of the Party and the country should be kept secret; whether it is better for activists to be close to the Party or not; whether it is better to be active or not, and so on, should all be clarified in the "blooming" and "contending." Qu Zheng and Yan Yi, Deputy Secretaries of the Party Committee of Beijing Medical College, made preliminary self-criticisms at the conference today on the issues of professional settings, academic system, and further improvement of teaching quality, which are of the greatest concern to all teachers and students. They believed that many of the opinions put forward by teachers and students in this regard were reasonable. When they thanked the non-Party friends for actively helping the Party in rectification, they also specifically relayed Professor Ma Wenzhao's criticism that some Party members' sectarianism made non-Party professors very sad, and pointed out that these criticisms were of great help in urging Party members to correct their shortcomings. However, they also pointed out that some people had put forward reactionary remarks such as "Chiang Kai-shek can also build socialism," and urged everyone to be vigilant, distinguish right from wrong, and criticize these reactionary remarks in the "contending" and "blooming."

　　Today, the Party Committees of eleven universities, including Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Institute of Physical Education, Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade, Beijing Foreign Affairs College, Beijing Normal College, Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, and Beijing Forestry College, also made self-criticism reports on the issue of rectification.

　　接受正确的批评　批判反动的言论
　　首都高等学校整风运动进入新阶段
　　又有十一个院校党委负责同志向全校师生员工作了检查报告
    本报特约新华社14日讯　首都今天又有十一个高等学校的党委负责人分别在各校师生员工大会上就整风问题作了初步的检查报告。
    在今天的报告会上，各校的党委负责人都就学校内存在的突出问题作了检查。他们在向真诚帮助党整风的党外人士致谢时，曾提到有些人的批评虽然不够全面，但他们的批评完全出自善良的愿望，因此也向他们表示谢意。同时，他们在报告中也指出，一部分右派分子发表了许多反党反社会主义的言论，大家在“齐放”“争鸣”中应揭发和批判这些反动言论，明辨是非，这样才能帮助党搞好整风。
    中共北京师范大学委员会书记何锡麟说：我们的领导思想，工作方法和工作作风上，是有很多缺点的。我们对学校的中心工作如教学工作、科学研究工作和师资培养提高工作等问题注意不够。学校的领导上缺乏自我批评精神，党的领导干部中滋长了骄傲自满情绪，党内民主生活不够健全。廖泰初先生说，“师大有四难：即会见领导难，谈心难，对党员了解难和办事难。”说明我们亟需加强和群众的联系，更多地直接和老教师直接接触、谈心。
    何锡麟还检查了思想工作上犯有教条主义、不从实际出发来贯彻执行上级指示的缺点。他说：比如实习问题，多数系主任主张实习一次，可是我未很好征求他们的意见而仍坚持实习二次。在提升讲师的问题上，有冒进思想，在严格掌握德才兼备、政治与业务并重的原则上有某些缺点。在去年评薪评级工作中，广泛深入征求群众意见不够，未能确切地了解教师业务工作的情况，其中有极少数的党员教师的级别订得偏高。
    何锡麟说：我们有些党员对党外人士不够尊重，在某些方面党群关系不够正常。朱庆永先生说只有在大报告上才看到我，邰爽秋先生说党群之间有“四道墙”“四层板”，这说明我们脱离群众的现象还是严重的。
    何锡麟接着报告了学校边整边改的情况。他说在助教提升讲师的工作中是有一定缺点的，现在已有一些党员主动申请下降，党委会准备将其中四人的学衔问题提交系和校行政讨论决定。在工资问题上，有的党员评高了的，现在根据他们本人的申请，党委要建议学校行政上把他们降下一级来。有一些党员领导干部去年领的福利费不合理，党委已同意他们退还，宿舍分配不合理问题已组成五人小组研究。
    何锡麟最后说：在整风中，绝大部分的批评和意见都是好的，我们要认真地接受和研究，并切实改正。有些意见尽管片面偏激，但出于热情帮助党整风，我们也是欢迎的。但也有极少数人的意见是错误的反动的，离开了帮助党整风的轨道，如“党天下”、“家天下”等等说法，在葛佩琦、储安平等发言前，学校就有人这样讲了。这种言论无疑地是在向党进攻。他说：现在不存在是否准许这些言论鸣放的问题，而是要通过“争鸣”“齐放”，辨明是非。
    中共北京政法学院委员会书记刘镜西说，整风开始以来，全校师生员工提出了很多批评和意见，其中绝大多数对党的整风都有很大帮助。例如副教务长雷洁琼提出：学校有些问题和她商量不够，她提出的有些意见不见下文，党员负责干部过去有时候态度很粗暴。这些意见都是很好的。还有许多师生员工对党群关系、学校机构庞杂、人浮于事的情况提出的批评意见也是很好的，应该诚恳地接受这些意见并加以改进。
    刘镜西说，在大家提出的许多意见中，一部分比较容易解决的正着手解决，有的已经解决了，如党委副书记郭迪等的补助费已声明退还；一部分问题必须经过系统研究才能解决；有些需要请示上级有关部门才能解决的，有些问题属于过去对于情况交代不够的，需要把情况向大家加以说明。他说，这些问题，属于党内的问题由党内来研究，行政上的问题建议由学校行政上来研究处理。
    刘镜西代表党委会对大家提出的批评和意见表示诚恳的欢迎。他指出，只要是善意的批评，尽管它与事实不尽符合，甚至有很大出入，或用语尖刻，带有刺激性，我们都认为它是好的。因为这些意见都是在承认党的领导，关心党、爱护党，是从搞好人民事业的愿望出发的。但是有一部分人的意见不能同意。它不是帮助党整风，而是借帮助党整风之名，来取消党的领导，进行反党的活动，企图把党挤出去。因此，应该予以坚决的反击。但是反对右派决不能把一般的不正确的意见和提意见的方法、态度不好的混为一谈。刘镜西说，为了明辨是非，使鸣放更加深入，准备在提出的许多问题中，就有些认识不一致的重大问题展开讨论，“齐放”、“争鸣”，以澄清思想。他举例说，像学院在知识分子政策的执行上是错误的还是正确的，今后知识分子要不要继续进行思想改造；学院建校以来的工作成绩是主要的还是错误是主要的，办校方针是正确的还是错误的；学院的党组织是不是一个宗派集团；现在是不是“党天下”；选拔干部应不应该重视政治条件；党内要不要汇报制度；对党和国家的机密要不要保密；积极分子是靠近党好，还是不靠近党好；是积极好，还是不积极好等问题，都应该在“齐放”“争鸣”中求得澄清。中共北京医学院委员会副书记曲正、阎毅今天分别就全院师生们最关心的专业设置、学制以及进一步提高教学质量等问题在大会上作了初步检查。他们认为师生们提出的这方面的意见有许多是合理的。他们在感谢党外朋友积极帮助党整风的时候，还特别转述了马文昭教授也为某些党员的宗派主义使党外教授很伤心的批评，提出这些批评对促使党员改正缺点有很大帮助。但是他们也指出了有人提出“蒋介石也能建设社会主义”这一类的反动言论，并提请大家提高警惕，明辨是非，在“争鸣”、“齐放”中批驳这些反动言论。
    今天就整风问题做检查报告的，还有北京农业大学、北京地质学院、北京体育学院、北京对外贸易学院、北京外交学院、北京师范学院、北京邮电学院和北京林学院共十一个高等学校的中共党委会。
