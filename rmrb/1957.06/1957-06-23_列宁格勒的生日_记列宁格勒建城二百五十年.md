　　Leningrad's Birthday
　　——Remembering the 250th Anniversary of the Founding of Leningrad
　　Our Newspaper Reporter Li He
    Today, June 23rd, all the people of the Soviet Union are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the founding of Leningrad. This Soviet Union's second largest city with a population of three million will celebrate a carnival-like festival today. A conference with foreign guests and delegations from all over the Soviet Union will be held in the Winter Palace Square, theatrical performances and gymnastics demonstrations will be held in the Kirov Stadium, and recreational activities will be organized on Kirov Island and in parks and gardens. Concerts and dances will be arranged in cultural palaces and clubs. People will joyfully watch fireworks and spend a sleepless White Night in the north.
    I went to see Leningrad a few days before its birthday. It was already full of a festive atmosphere. This famous city, which has experienced three eras of feudalism, capitalism, and socialism, appears even younger.
    One evening after dinner, I strolled from one end of Nevsky Prospekt to the other. This is a straight and wide avenue lined with neat five-story buildings. I looked east and west all the way, taking a full two hours. This avenue stretches all the way to the Admiralty building and to the banks of the Neva River.
    The Admiralty is in the center of the city, and the Winter Palace Museum is to its right. The square in front of the Winter Palace is surrounded by a row of three-story buildings in a semicircle. In the middle of this semicircle is an archway, with a sculpture of a triumphal chariot pulled by six horses on top. In the center of this square stands a column made of a whole piece of polished granite, with a bronze "Angel" standing on top. Leningrad has many places, with beautiful buildings and revolutionary events, that attract people like magnets, and the Winter Palace Square is one such place. On "Bloody Sunday" in 1905, the Tsarist government massacred unarmed people who came to petition through the archway in this square. On November 7, 1917, the insurgent people poured into this archway, passed through this square, and attacked the Winter Palace. And now, the Winter Palace has become a people's museum. Peaceful doves are flying in the sky above the square.
    Across from the Winter Palace, the stone-built Peter and Paul Fortress stretches out with its cathedral-style spire. That is the earliest developed location in Leningrad. Two hundred and fifty years ago, Peter the Great first built a fortress on this island at the mouth of the Neva River, and then began the construction of the city of St. Petersburg. Soldiers built the fortress, and then tens of thousands of peasants from all over Russia built the capital on one hundred and one barren islands. Peter the Great "opened a window to peer into Europe" (Pushkin), and the ideological currents of democracy and socialism flowed into Russia through this window. For more than two hundred years, St. Petersburg became the center of Russian culture. The advanced elements of the Russian people waged arduous, tenacious, and unyielding struggles. Many outstanding figures among them who pursued the truth were imprisoned in this fortress by the Tsarist government and spent long, dark years. It is no accident that Russia emitted such brilliant light in literature, art, science, and political thought in the 18th and 19th centuries.
    I strolled with the people in front of the "Bronze Horseman" (an equestrian statue of Peter the Great) to the left of the Winter Palace, on the granite-paved riverbank, greedily admiring the picturesque scenery on both sides of the river. Unconsciously, the sky was already vast, the streetlights were on, and the central section of the bridge between the Admiralty and Vasilyevsky Island on the north bank was divided into two and hoisted up. Looking at my watch, wow, it's midnight. But the sky hasn't darkened. Before long, the south bank was illuminated by a layer of twilight, while the north bank already revealed a faint rosy glow. A gentle breeze ruffled the gray surface of the Neva River, and the spires of the Admiralty and the fortress shone with newly gilded light. This is the White Night. Leningrad's 250th anniversary happened to be held during the days of the White Nights, and the people celebrating can truly spend a sleepless night.
    At the time when the White Night turned to dawn, on the quiet north bank of the Neva River, I saw the freshly painted three-funnel cruiser "Aurora" moored there. Forty years ago, its cannon fire began a new era in human history. The "Aurora" is now a naval cadet training ship, and there is an exhibition room of revolutionary events on it. It is endlessly fascinating. Naturally, the apologists of capitalism will be disappointed at the sight of it and will find it an eyesore to put it in the beautiful Neva River. Leningrad's 250th anniversary coincides with the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. As this festival arrives, the foundation stone of the Lenin monument will be unveiled in Uprising Square on Nevsky Prospekt. Leningrad is the cradle of the October Revolution. Here, people cannot help but recall the revolutionary scenes of forty years ago. In front of the Finland Station and the Smolny Palace, there are monuments to Lenin. These are the two most memorable places. After the February Revolution overthrew the Tsarist system, a new task of transforming from a bourgeois democratic revolution to a socialist revolution arose. The Party and the people needed a correct new direction. Lenin returned from abroad at this time. According to the recollection of an old worker: It was very cold at that time. When Lenin arrived at the station, it was almost midnight. The station was crowded with people, who shouted "Lenin! Lenin!" Lenin was pushed onto an armored car and delivered a speech to the masses, shouting the slogan "Long live the socialist revolution!" On the evening of November 6th, Lenin arrived at the Smolny Palace, the headquarters of the uprising, from his secret residence. According to a former "Pravda" worker's recollection: That evening, the brightly lit windows of the Smolny Palace could be seen from afar. Soldiers, sailors, and workers hurried towards there, receiving instructions from there. At three o'clock in the morning, the Smolny Palace demanded the surrender of the Provisional Government stationed in the Winter Palace. At six o'clock, the Peter and Paul Fortress again demanded the surrender of the Winter Palace. The telephone lines of the Provisional Government were cut off. The fate of Petrograd was sealed, and the Winter Palace became an isolated island. At this time, the attack on the Winter Palace began.
    Leningrad experienced many foreign threats, the most serious of which was the nine hundred-day siege it suffered during the Soviet Patriotic War. Today, a monument to the victory of the Patriotic War will be erected near Srednerogatskaya. Leningraders often recall the arduous struggle during the two and a half years of being besieged. At that time, the people of the whole Soviet Union supported Leningrad, and the residents of Leningrad also did their best to carry out the defense war. Many institutions posted notices at their doors saying: "Office closed. Everyone is on the front line." The Kirov factory was only four kilometers from the front line, and was hit by more than 5,000 enemy shells and 200 bombs, but the workers here did not stop repairing tanks. When the power plant was destroyed, locomotives were used to generate electricity so that the factories could continue production. When there was no running water, water was drawn from the river. At one point, the city had only two days' worth of food left. People gnawed on a little bread every day, enduring hunger and supporting the front line.
    Although the scars of war can no longer be seen in Leningrad, it has indeed suffered great damage. Nearly a thousand factories were destroyed, and almost every building was hit by bullets. In 1945, Leningrad's industrial output was less than one-third of that in 1940, and the number of employees was reduced by half. But in just three years, the output of this large industrial city had recovered to pre-war levels. The city has also been built more beautifully than before the war. Leningraders did 50 million hours of voluntary labor in their spare time. New residences, new streets, and new districts have appeared. The first eight-station underground tramway was built here, five of which are more spacious than the Moscow underground tramway stations.
    Leningrad possesses a strong foundation of industrial production and scientific research, and it has rapidly developed into one of the main cities of technological progress in the Soviet Union after the war. Due to the improvement of technology and labor organization, Leningrad's industrial output in 1956 has increased to 2.6 times that of pre-war. Now, the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker is being manufactured here. The completion of the synchrophasotron at the Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research also has a share of the strength of Leningrad scientists, engineers, and workers.
    Leningrad, it is a beautiful city, a revolutionary city, a heroic city. Although it is far away on the shores of the Baltic Sea, it is very close to our country. This is not only because the factories here are manufacturing machines and instruments for our country, not only because the research institutes and universities here are cultivating talents for our country, but also because "the salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism" (Mao Zedong), and this world-shaking salvo was fired from Leningrad. On this birthday of Leningrad, may it further prosper and develop. (Attached picture)

### 列宁格勒的生日——记列宁格勒建城二百五十年

　　列宁格勒的生日
　　——记列宁格勒建城二百五十年
　　本报记者　李何
    今天，6月23日，全苏联人民都在庆祝列宁格勒建城二百五十周年。这个拥有三百万人口的苏联第二个大城市今天将渡过狂欢的节日。有外国来宾和苏联各地代表团参加的大会将在冬宫广场上举行，在基洛夫运动场上将有戏剧演出和体操表演，在基洛夫岛上和公园、花园里将组织游艺会，在文化宫和俱乐部里将安排演奏会、舞会。人们将欢乐地看焰火，渡过不眠的北国白夜。
    我在列宁格勒的生日到来前几天去看望了它。它已经充满迎接节日的气氛。这座经历过封建主义、资本主义和社会主义三个时代的名城，显得更加年青了。
    一天晚饭以后，我从涅瓦大街的这头一直散步到它的那头。这是一条笔直的宽阔的马路，两旁排列着整齐的五层楼房，我一路上东盼西望，足足走了两个钟头。这条大街一直伸到海军府的建筑物跟前，伸到涅瓦河岸。
    海军府在全市的中心，它的右边就是冬宫博物馆。冬宫前的广场，由一排三层楼房围成半圆形。在这个半圆圈当中有一道拱门，拱门顶上立着六匹马的凯旋车雕刻。在这个广场中央竖着一根由整块花岗石磨成的圆柱，柱顶站着青铜刻的“天使”。列宁格勒有许多地点，以美丽的建筑和革命的事迹，像磁石一样吸引着人们，冬宫的广场就是这样一个地点。1905年的“流血星期日”，沙皇政府就是在这个广场上屠杀从拱门走进来请愿的赤手空拳的人民的。1917年11月7日，起义的人民就是涌进这个拱门，经过这个广场，攻击冬宫的。而现在，冬宫已成为人民的博物馆。和平的鸽子在广场上空飞翔着。
    在冬宫的对岸，石头砌的彼得保罗炮垒，伸着天主教堂式的塔尖。那是列宁格勒的最早开发的地点。二百五十年前，彼得一世首先在这个涅瓦河口的岛屿上筑起炮垒，然后才开始圣彼得堡城的建设。士兵筑了炮垒，接着俄国各地来的成千成万的农民，在一百零一个荒岛上建设了首都。彼得一世“打开了窥视欧洲的窗户”（普希金），民主和社会主义的思潮从这个窗户流进俄国来了。在二百多年中，彼得堡成为俄国文化的中心。俄国人民的先进分子进行了艰苦卓绝的不屈不挠的战斗。他们当中许多追求真理的优秀人物，曾经被沙皇政府囚禁在这个炮垒里，渡过了漫长的黑暗的岁月。俄国在十八、十九世纪文学、艺术、科学、政治思想上发出了那样灿烂的光辉，绝不是偶然的。
    我随着人们在冬宫左边的“青铜骑士”
  （彼得一世骑马刻像）跟前，在花岗石砌的河岸上漫步，贪看两岸如画的景色。不知不觉，天色已经苍茫，街灯亮了，海军府和北岸瓦西利耶夫岛之间桥梁的中央一段分成两扇吊起来了。看看表，呀，子夜了。但是天色没有见黑下去。不一会，南岸照着一层暮色，而北岸已吐露出淡淡的朝霞了。微风吹皱灰色的涅瓦河面，海军府和炮垒的塔尖上，闪耀出新镀的金光。这就是白夜。列宁格勒二百五十年恰巧在有白夜的日子里举行，庆祝的人们真可以过不夜天了。
    在白夜转到黎明的时候，在静静的涅瓦河的北岸，我看到停泊在那儿的油漆一新的三个烟囱的“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰。四十年前，它的炮声开始了人类历史的新纪元。“阿芙乐尔”现在是海军学员训练舰，在它上面还有革命事迹的展览室。它是百看不厌的。自然，资本主义的卫道者会一看到它就扫兴，会觉得把它摆在美丽的涅瓦河中很刺眼。列宁格勒的二百五十年恰好逢上十月革命四十年。在这个节日到来的时候，在涅瓦大街的起义广场上列宁纪念像的奠基石将要揭幕。列宁格勒是十月革命的摇篮。在这里，人们不禁要回忆起四十年前革命的情景。在芬兰火车站和斯莫尔尼宫的前面，都有列宁的纪念像。这是最值得纪念的两个地方。在二月革命推翻了沙皇制度以后，产生了从资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命的新任务。党和人民需要正确的新方针。列宁在这个时候从国外回来了。据一位老工人回忆：那时天气很冷。当列宁到车站时，快半夜了。车站前人山人海，人们高呼着“列宁！列宁！”列宁被拥上铁甲车，向群众发表了演说，高呼“社会主义革命万岁！”的口号。11月6日晚，列宁从秘密的住所到了起义的指挥部斯莫尔尼宫。据一位前“真理报”工作者回忆：当晚远远可以望见斯莫尔尼宫灯光明亮的窗户。士兵、水兵和工人们匆匆忙忙地走向那里，从那里取得指示。早晨三点钟，斯莫尔尼宫要求驻在冬宫的临时政府缴械。六点钟，彼得保罗炮垒向冬宫又提出了缴械的要求。临时政府的电话被割断了。彼得堡的命运已定，冬宫成了孤岛。这时开始了对冬宫的攻击。
    列宁格勒经历了许多次外来的威胁，最严重的一次是在苏联卫国战争中所受的九百天的包围。今天，在中罗加特卡附近将竖起卫国战争胜利的纪念碑。列宁格勒人时常回忆起在被围的两年半中的艰苦斗争。当时苏联全国人民都支持列宁格勒，而列宁格勒居民也全力进行保卫战。许多机关的门口贴着条子说：“停止办公。所有人都上前线了。”基洛夫工厂离前线才四公里，中了敌人的五千多发炮弹和两百个炸弹，但是这里的工人没有停止修理坦克的工作。发电厂被毁了，就利用火车头来发电，使各个工厂能够继续生产。自来水没有了，就从河里提水。有一个时候，全市才剩下两天的食粮。人们每天啃着一点点面包，忍饥受饿地支持前线。
    在列宁格勒虽然早已看不见战争的伤痕，然而它确实受过极大的破坏。近千厂房被毁，差不多每栋房屋都中过弹。1945年列宁格勒的工业产量不及1940年的三分之一，职工人数减少了一半。但是不过三年，这个大工业城市的产量已经恢复到了战前水平。城市也建设得比战前更加美丽了。列宁格勒人在工余作了五千万小时的义务劳动。新的住宅、新的街道、新的区出现了。这里建成了第一条八个站的地下电车道，其中五个站比莫斯科地下电车站还宽敞。
    列宁格勒拥有强大的工业生产和科学研究的基础，它在战后迅速地发展成为苏联技术进步的主要城市之一。由于改进技术和劳动组织，列宁格勒的工业产量在1956年已经增长为战前的二点六倍。现在，世界第一艘原子能破冰船正在这里制造。杜布诺联合核子研究所的同步稳相加速器的建成，也有列宁格勒科学家、工程师和工人的一份力量。
    列宁格勒，它是一个美丽的城市，革命的城市，英雄的城市。它虽然远处在波罗的海之滨，但是和我国很接近。这不仅因为这里的工厂为我国制造着机器和仪器，不仅因为这里的研究所和高等学校为我国培养着人才，而且因为“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”（毛泽东），这个震动世界的炮声正是从列宁格勒发出的。在这列宁格勒的生日，愿它进一步繁荣和发展。（附图片）
