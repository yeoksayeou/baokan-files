	A Few Opinions on the Current Rectification Campaign
	Mao Guangsheng
	If there were no deviations among Communist Party members, why would there be a rectification campaign? If rectification is a matter for the Party, why is criticism needed from outside the Party? Understanding this principle will reveal the significance of the rectification campaign, which is to foster an emotional connection between our Party and those outside the Party. To unite through criticism, and to become even more united through criticism. If everyone places the interests of the country first and undertakes the affairs of the nation together, making it more and more consolidated, then the Party and the democratic parties can coexist for a long time, and the people can better enjoy the happiness of a socialist country.

	Criticism is help, helping Party members overcome sectarianism, bureaucracy, and subjectivism, and correcting all mistakes. If a minority within the Party refuses criticism and does not correct their mistakes after being made aware of them, then it is the fault of those Party members.

	Everyone should understand that exposing contradictions is precisely for resolving contradictions, not creating them; speaking frankly about estrangement is precisely for resolving estrangement, not increasing it.

	To love people with virtue and treat each other with sincerity should not be considered an anti-Party manifestation. If a minority outside the Party worries about being labeled in the future and does not speak when they should, does not connect when they should, and does not criticize when they should, then it is our non-Party members who are at fault.

	However, connection requires extending a hand of friendship, making people feel warmth when they grasp it; criticism requires speaking words of understanding, making people feel convinced when they hear it.

	No one is perfect, who can be without fault? The trouble is that people do not realize their own faults. I believe that our criticism must recognize that it is for unity, not attack, that it is based on the interests of the country, not personal aims. Future deviations must not repeat the same mistakes, and past deviations must not be rehashed as old scores. Historical old scores can never be settled even in ten thousand years. As long as the criticism is fair and just, the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take heed, then it can be called contention or harmony.

	Objectively speaking, Communist Party members sacrificed their families and lives, braving countless hardships to establish today's new society. This is an earth-shattering event, and it is also a moving and praiseworthy one. If we look back at history, the Han Dynasty's regime was controlled by the people of Fengpei, the Tang Dynasty's regime was controlled by the people of He and Fen, the Ming Dynasty's regime was controlled by the people of Hao and Si, and the Qing Dynasty's regime was controlled by the Manchus. None of those dynasties had the situation we have today. Of course, in essence, the current political system is incomparable to the past.

	To be frank and say something that I should examine myself: my mind was instilled with the history of the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and I was also influenced by Mencius's doctrine that "the world will eventually be unified." At first, when I heard "Let a hundred flowers bloom," I had no objections. When I heard "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," I felt it was too early. Although these two phrases came from Chairman Mao, I compared myself to Zilu, who was displeased with Confucius.

	Finally, I realized that the existence of contradictions and estrangement between the Party and the masses is not a good phenomenon. As the Zuo Commentary says, "Do not let it spread, for it will be difficult to deal with." I admire Chairman Mao for wanting to connect the Party and the masses as early as possible, so he wanted both "Let a hundred flowers bloom" and "Let a hundred schools of thought contend." He said that the affairs of the country cannot be handled by a few communists alone; everyone must bear the responsibility together. Compared to the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties, which regarded political power as a family affair, this is infinitely greater.

	However, since it is called "contention" and "a hundred schools," then everyone will contend differently. Because of different positions and different perspectives, one cannot force others to agree. One cannot only allow affirmation, nor can one only allow negation. It must still return to Mencius's statement of being "unified" (unified under Marxism-Leninism and unified under socialism) before there can be a conclusion.

	I am a non-partisan and non-factional person, eighty-five years old. A person who is about to die speaks truthfully. I hope that people inside and outside the Party will stand on the same front, remove the bad habits, and establish good reputations. This is called rectification, not persecuting people. Only in this way can the result of criticism be greater unity.

    对目前整风的一点意见
    冒广生
    如果说共产党员没有偏差，那就何必整风；整风是党内的事，何必要党外来批评。明白这个道理，便知整风意义，是要我们党内党外发生感情上的联系。从团结而批评，从批评而越团结。大家一致以国家为前提，把国家事务担负起来，使得巩固又巩固，然后党与各民主党派才能长期共存，而人民才会更好地享受社会主义国家的幸福。
    批评就是帮助，帮助党员克服宗派主义、官僚主义和主观主义，把一切错误纠正过来。如果有少数党内人拒绝批评，知过不改，那是党员不对。
    大家要知道，揭露矛盾，正所以解决矛盾，而不是制造矛盾；说穿隔阂，正所以解除隔阂，而不是增加隔阂。
    爱人以德，相见以诚，不能认为反党的表现。如果有少数党外人顾虑将来会扣帽子，该鸣不鸣，该联系而不联系，该批评而不批评，那是我们非党员不对。
    但是联系要伸出友爱的手来，使人握之温暖，批评要说出知己的话来，使人听之悦服。
    人非圣人，谁能无过，人苦不自知耳。我以为我们的批评，须认清是团结不是攻击，是以国家为前提，不是以个人为目的。往后的偏差不能蹈复辙，从前的偏差，也不能算旧账。历史上的旧账，是一万年算不清的。只要鸣得公，鸣得正，言者无罪，闻者足戒，那就叫做争鸣也可，叫做和鸣也可。
    平心而论，共产党员牺牲身家，出生入死，从千辛万苦中，建立起今天的新社会。这是惊天动地的事，亦是可泣可歌的事。我们翻一翻历史，汉初政权，操之丰沛人的手，唐初政权，操之河汾人的手，明初政权，操之濠泗人的手，清初政权，操之满洲人的手。那一朝有过如今的局面，当然从本质上说，现在的政体绝非往昔可比。
    我坦白地说一句应该检讨自己的话，我脑筋受了汉唐明清历史的灌输，又受了孟子天下乌乎定定于一的教条，起初听到百花齐放，我无异议，听到百家争鸣，我觉得为时尚早。这两句话，虽然出自毛主席，我自比于子路不悦仲尼。
    最后我知道党群之间有了矛盾有了隔阂情形，这不是好现象。左传说无使滋蔓，蔓难图也，才佩服毛主席是及早要党群联系，所以既要百花齐放，又要百家争鸣，他说国家大事，几个共产党包办不来，要大家一齐担负。比之汉唐明清把政权为家天下的政权，不知伟大多少了。
    但是既曰争鸣，又曰百家，那就人各异鸣。由于各人的立场不同，看问题的角度不同，自不能强人以苟同。不能只允许肯定，亦不能只允许否定。仍须归到孟子定于一的话（一于马列主义一于社会主义）才有结论。
    我是一个无党无派的人，行年八十五岁。人之将死，其言也善，我是希望党内外人站在一条战线上，把坏的风气移去，好的风声树起来。这才叫做整风，不是整人。这才做到批评的结果是更加团结。
