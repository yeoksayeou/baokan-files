Absolutely No Allowing "Guangming Daily" to be Pulled Off the Socialist Track
The China Democratic League Branch of "Guangming Daily" Refutes Chu Anping's Erroneous Arguments

(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday afternoon, the China Democratic League branch of "Guangming Daily" held a general meeting of all League members, unanimously opposing the speech made by Chu Anping in his capacity as editor-in-chief of "Guangming Daily" at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. They severely refuted his erroneous remarks about "the Party's world" and resolutely stated that they would absolutely not allow "Guangming Daily" to be pulled off the socialist track.

In addition to League members, more than thirty comrades who were not League members also participated in the meeting. Wu Han, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Guan Shixiong, secretary-general, also attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

Directors and deputy directors of various departments of the "Guangming Daily" editorial department, as well as some editors and reporters, spoke at the meeting one after another. Speakers pointed out that Chu Anping's so-called "Party's world" statement was not only a complete distortion but also a slander against the Communist Party of China. Zhang Yinhuai and Qiu Lin said that Chu Anping's claim that a Party member must be arranged as the "head" in every unit, large or small, even in a section or group, across the country does not conform to the facts. Many government departments have non-Party members as heads. Why did Chu Anping obliterate the facts? They said that the Party has never excluded non-Party members. Chu Anping's absurd labeling of the Party with "the Party's world" ideology is a distortion and slander of the Party.

Xu Yian said: Chu Anping's anti-socialist speech is by no means accidental. Not long ago, at a symposium held by this newspaper inviting publicity cadres from various democratic parties, he said that the editorials published by "Guangming Daily" in the past were either praising the Communist Party or were dogmatic. Zhang Youjun asked: Why can't the editorials of "Guangming Daily" praise the Communist Party? The Communist Party led the Chinese people to turn themselves over and led the Chinese people to socialism. Why shouldn't it be praised?

Xiong Jianying said: Chu Anping's speech in the name of the editor-in-chief of "Guangming Daily" has caused great damage to the newspaper. Some people ask, what kind of newspaper is "Guangming Daily"? Is it a socialist democratic party newspaper? Or a bourgeois opposition party newspaper? I think this question is rightly raised. Under the leadership of Chu Anping's erroneous thinking, it is very likely to lead "Guangming Daily" onto an anti-socialist road, which is not allowed by all the staff of "Guangming Daily" and the people of the whole country.

Ba Bo said, all of us comrades of "Guangming Daily" must firmly defend the socialist position. "Guangming Daily" will always be a socialist democratic party newspaper! Oppose all absurd remarks that deviate from socialism, and oppose turning "Guangming Daily" into a bourgeois opposition party newspaper. Pan Wenbin and Chen Jizi said: Although Chu Anping's speech was made in the name of the editor-in-chief of "Guangming Daily," his opinions do not represent the opinions of the staff of "Guangming Daily." Each of us has a common and general principle in our work—socialism, and the basis of our work is socialist interests. Chu Anping's speech has a fundamental divergence from our thinking.

After Wu Han analyzed the errors of Chu Anping's speech in detail, he pointed out that Chu Anping's speech violated the charter of the China Democratic League and the charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; his speech had a destructive effect. Finally, Wu Han hoped that everyone would express their attitude and draw a clear line with Chu Anping.

Guan Shixiong pointed out in his speech that Chu Anping's speech was intolerable to the people of the whole country, including the members of the China Democratic League. If we tolerate such absurd remarks, we will lose our position. Guan Shixiong said: The basic direction for us League members is: first, to stand firmly on the people's position; second, to accept the leadership of the Communist Party; and third, to resolutely follow the socialist road. Anyone who violates this basic direction, and any remarks and actions that deviate from socialism are wrong, and we must fight against them. Guan Shixiong called on all League members to unite, uphold the Constitution and the League's program, and wage a resolute struggle against remarks that depart from the socialist road and slander the Communist Party.

### 决不容许把光明日报拉出社会主义的轨道  民盟光明日报支部驳斥储平错误论调

　　决不容许把光明日报拉出社会主义的轨道
　　民盟光明日报支部驳斥储平错误论调
    本报讯  昨日下午，中国民主同盟光明日报社支部召开全体盟员大会，一致反对储安平以光明日报总编辑的名义在中共中央统战部座谈会上所作的发言，对他所谓“党天下”的错误言论进行了严厉的驳斥，并坚决表示决不容许把光明日报拉出社会主义的轨道。
    参加这次大会的除盟员外还有部分非盟同志，共三十多人。民主同盟北京市委会主委吴晗和秘书长关世雄也参加了大会，并在会上作了发言。
    在大会上先后发言的有光明日报编辑部各部主任、副主任和部分编辑、记者。发言的人都指出储安平的所谓“党天下”的说法，不仅是彻头彻尾的歪曲，并且是对中国共产党的污蔑。张荫槐、丘林说，储安平说在全国范围内，不论大小单位甚至一个科、一个组都要安排一个党员做“头儿”是不符合事实的，政府许多部门有非党人士担任首长，储安平为什么要抹杀事实？他们说，党从来没有排斥过非党人士，储安平给党加上“党天下”思想的荒谬帽子，是对党的歪曲和污蔑。
    徐亦安说：储安平的反社会主义的发言，绝不是偶然的。不久以前，他在本报邀请各民主党派宣传干部举行的座谈会上就曾经说过，光明日报过去发表的社论，不是对共产党歌功颂德，就是教条主义的。张又君问道：光明日报的社论为什么不能歌颂共产党？共产党领导中国人民翻了身，领导中国人民走向社会主义，为什么不该歌颂？
    熊剑英说：储安平用光明日报总编辑名义的发言，给报社带来极大的损害。有人问光明日报是什么报？是社会主义的民主党派的报纸？还是资产阶级反对党的报纸？我认为这问题提的对，在储安平错误思想领导下，是很可能把光明日报引导到反社会主义的道路上去的，而这是光明日报全体职工、也是全国人民所不能容许的。
    巴波说，我们光明日报全体同志一定要坚守住社会主义阵地，光明日报永远是社会主义的民主党派的报纸！反对一切背离社会主义的荒谬言论，反对把光明日报办成资产阶级反对党的报纸。潘文彬、陈季子说：储安平的发言，虽然用的是光明日报总编辑的名义，但他的意见，并不能代表光明日报工作人员的意见。我们每个人在工作中有一个共同的、总的原则——社会主义，我们工作的依归是社会主义利益。储安平的发言，和我们的思想有根本的分歧。
    吴晗详细分析了储安平发言的错误后，指出储安平的发言违背了中国民主同盟盟章和中国人民政协章程；他的发言起了破坏作用。最后吴晗希望大家表明态度和储安平划清界限。
    关世雄在发言中指出储安平的发言是全国人民包括民盟盟员在内所不能容忍的。容忍这样的荒谬言论，我们就丧失了立场。关世雄说：我们盟员的基本方向：一是要站稳人民的立场，二是接受共产党的领导，三是坚决走社会主义道路。任何人违背了这个基本的方向，离开社会主义的言论和行动都是错误的，我们就要斗争。关世雄号召全体盟员团结起来，为拥护宪法和盟的纲领，向脱离社会主义道路，污蔑共产党的言论进行坚决的斗争。
