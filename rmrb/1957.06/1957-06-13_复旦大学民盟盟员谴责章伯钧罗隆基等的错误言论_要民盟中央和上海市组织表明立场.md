Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. At a meeting of the Fudan University branch of the Democratic League this afternoon, many speakers demanded that the Central Committee of the Democratic League and the Shanghai Municipal Committee state their position and attitude in the midst of the Great Blooming and Contending. They unanimously condemned the erroneous statements of Democratic League leaders Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chen Xingui, and Democratic League Shanghai Municipal Committee member Chen Renbing, among others.

	Wu Haoqing, Associate Professor of Chemistry, said that although Zhang Bojun, Chen Xingui, and Chu Anping spoke from different angles, their aim was the same: they did not welcome the people's democratic dictatorship and could not stand the leadership of the Communist Party. Their speeches were a forgetfulness of their own identity and a loss of political stance. He said that the Democratic League had fought alongside the Party before and after liberation and had played a certain role in the revolution. In order to maintain the glorious history of the Democratic League, he demanded that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League convene a city-wide representative meeting to properly discuss their position and analyze their thoughts and motives.

	The mathematician Su Buqing said that now is the time for League members to think independently. Our thinking is not yet pure, and if there are mistakes, they must be corrected, as long as there are no ulterior motives. If Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji do not admit their mistakes and cannot stand the test, they will not be recognized as leaders of the Democratic League next time.

	Yang Qishen, Professor of the Foreign Languages ​​Department, believes that the central organs of the democratic parties should express their views on the erroneous remarks of Chu Anping and others.

	Chen Wangdao, President of Fudan University, said that in the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, small rights and wrongs can be ignored, but major rights and wrongs, public and private rights and wrongs, cannot be ignored. He said that it is not feasible to oppose factions with factions. He called on League members to criticize the Central Committee of the Democratic League and the Shanghai Municipal Committee.

	Hu Wenshu, Associate Professor of the Chinese Department, said that the leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League have rightist ideas. What path will this lead us on? The socialist road or the capitalist road? She hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League would hold a meeting to state its attitude towards the remarks of Chen Renbing and others.

	Quan Zenggu, Professor of Philosophy, believes that the remarks of the Democratic League's rightists are intended to overthrow the leadership of the Party. He said that Xu Zhucheng is one of the leaders of the Shanghai Democratic League, and the tendency of the "Wenhui Bao," of which he is the director, has been bad recently and should be examined and corrected. He said that if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked, and this kind of unhealthy trend must be rectified from above.

	Shu Zongqiao, Associate Professor of the Journalism Department of Fudan University, publicly reviewed his mistake of preventing Da Yijin from speaking at the meeting last time, and apologized to Da Yijin. He also rebuked the fallacies of Zhang Bojun and others. He said that he would resolutely take the socialist road and get close to the Communist Party.

　　复旦大学民盟盟员谴责章伯钧罗隆基等的错误言论
　　要民盟中央和上海市组织表明立场
    新华社上海12日电  在今天下午举行的民盟复旦大学支部大会上，很多发言的人要求民盟中央和上海市委员会表明在大鸣大放中的立场和态度。他们一致谴责民盟负责人章伯钧、罗隆基、陈新桂及民盟上海市委员会委员陈仁炳等人的错误言论。
    化学系副教授吴浩青说，章伯钧、陈新桂、储安平等讲话的角度虽然不同，但目的是一个：不欢迎人民民主专政，看不惯共产党的领导。他们的发言是忘记了自己的身份，失去了政治立场。他说，民盟在解放前后一直与党并肩作战，对革命起了一定的作用。为了维护民盟的光荣历史，他要求民盟上海市委员会召开全市代表大会，好好讨论他们的立场，分析他们的思想和动机。
    数学家苏步青说，现在是需要盟员独立思考的时候。我们的思想还不纯洁，有错误就要改，只要不是别有用心就好。章伯钧、罗隆基要是不承认错误，经不起考验，下次就不承认他们对民盟的领导。
    外文系教授杨岂深认为，对储安平等人的错误言论，民主党派的中央应该有所表示。
    复旦大学校长陈望道说，百家争鸣，小的是非可以不论，但是大是大非，公是公非，不能不论。他说，以宗派反对宗派是不行的。他号召盟员对民盟中央和上海市委员会展开批评。
    中文系副教授胡文淑说，民盟上海市委员会领导人中有右派思想，这会引我们走上什么道路上去？走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路？希望民盟上海市委员会召开大会，对陈仁炳等人的言论表明态度。
    哲学系教授全增嘏认为，民盟右派的言论是要推翻党的领导。他说，徐铸成是民盟上海市负责人之一，由他任社长的“文汇报”最近一个时期的倾向是不好的，应当检查纠正。他说，上梁不正下梁歪，一定要整掉上面这种歪风。
    复旦大学新闻系副教授舒宗侨在会上公开检讨了上次在会上阻止笪移今发言的错误，并对笪移今表示歉意。他还斥责了章伯钧等人的谬论。他说，他要坚决走社会主义的路，靠拢共产党。
