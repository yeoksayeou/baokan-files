Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 23rd: In the past week, the U.S. stock market experienced its biggest price drop in five months. Sources say that a major reason for the decline was the disarmament talks in London, which caused many stocks related to "defense" industries to fall. At the same time, the continuous decline in steel production for the second week and low copper prices also hit the stocks of these metal companies. As for aircraft stocks, it is said that they were affected by a statement issued by the Department of Defense about cutting certain expenditures in military spending, which has triggered a chain reaction of falling aluminum and other stocks.

The total value of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell by $5.828 billion in the past week, which accounts for 3% of the total value of all stocks.

The scale of this decline is unprecedented since mid-January of this year, when then-Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey said that the current huge government spending would cause a "hair-raising depression."

　　裁军会谈有苗头  美国股票大跌价
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：过去一周内，美国股票市场经历了一次五个月来未曾有过的大跌价。消息说，跌价的一个主要原因是伦敦的裁军会谈，这使许多同“防务”有关行业的股票都发生了下跌的情况。同时，钢铁生产的连续第二周下降和铜价叫低，也打击了这些金属公司的股票。至于飞机股票，据说是因为国防部发表了一个要削减军费中某些开支的声明而遭到了影响，它已经引起了铝和其他股票下跌的连锁反应。
    纽约证券交易所挂牌的股票价格在过去一周里一共下跌了五十八亿二千八百万美元，这个数字占所有的股票的总值的3％。
    这种下跌的规模是到今年1月中旬以后所未见的，1月中的那一次跌风是由于财政部长汉弗来说，目前庞大的政府开支将会引起一次“令人心寒的萧条”。
