Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, June 17th: Gu Yunting, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible cadres went deep into the rural areas and persuaded cadres and the masses to handle some water conservancy disputes in the spirit of rectification.

In the past, whenever the rainy season came, neighboring areas of Hebei Province bordering Henan and Shandong provinces, as well as between prefectures and prefectures, counties and counties, villages and villages within the province, only considered their own flood control and drainage. They did not pay attention to the losses of the other party, which led to incidents of mutually forced water discharge and forced water blocking. More than twenty such incidents occurred last year, some of which were serious enough to result in mass conflicts and fights, undermining the unity between farmers and exacerbating the disaster. In response to this situation, at the beginning of the rectification movement, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee listed the issue of water conservancy disputes as one of the first internal contradictions among the people to be resolved. Gu Yunting, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, Ruan Bosheng, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, Ding Tingxin, Member of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department, and others led working groups to areas bordering Xingtai and Handan, Tongxian and Tianjin, Cangxian and Tianjin prefectures, where contradictions were more acute and problems were more concentrated. Together with party and government leading cadres at all levels, they went deep into the field, conducted on-the-spot inspections, visited the masses, and helped the parties concerned, in the spirit of rectification of "unity–criticism–unity," to conduct full consultations based on the principles of "combining storage and drainage, taking both upstream and downstream into account," and "minor interests subordinate to major interests, major interests should appropriately take care of minor interests." At present, with the exception of the water conservancy dispute in the area bordering Cangxian and Tianjin prefectures, which is still being resolved through consultation, agreements have been revised and reached in the other two areas. Some places have also carried out water conservancy projects such as water storage and drainage in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.

In the past, the area adjacent to Gu'an County of Tongxian Prefecture and Yongqing County and Baxian County of Tianjin Prefecture had many disputes. Cadres and farmers in dozens of villages had delayed production due to years of disputes, and even relatives and friends had broken off contact.

Recently, with the help of the working group of the Provincial Party Committee, the three counties reached an agreement that satisfied both cadres and farmers. The villages concerned also elected representatives to hold a mass get-together. The representatives unanimously stated that they would understand each other, strengthen unity, jointly overcome floods, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

　　河北省党政领导人员
    深入农村处理水利纠纷
    新华社保定17日电　中共河北省委员会书记处书记谷云亭和其他负责干部深入农村，说服干部、群众以整风精神处理了一些水利纠纷。
    河北省过去每当雨季，同邻省河南和山东，省内专区和专区、县和县、村和村等相毗邻地带，因上游和下游、左岸和右岸，各方只顾自己防涝排水，不注意照顾对方损失，曾发生互相强泄水、强堵水的纠纷事件。去年发生二十多起，严重的出现过群众性的冲突和械斗，破坏了农民间的团结，也扩大了灾情。河北省委针对这种情况在整风运动开始时，即把水利纠纷问题列为首先要解决的人民内部矛盾问题之一。省委书记处书记谷云亭，省委农村工作部部长、副省长阮泊生，省委委员、水利厅副厅长丁廷馨等，分别率领工作组，前往矛盾较尖锐、问题较集中的邢台和邯郸、通县和天津、沧县和天津等专区的毗邻地带，会同各级党、政领导干部，深入现场，实地察看，访问群众，帮助有关方面本着团结——批评——团结的整风精神，根据“蓄泄兼顾，上下兼顾”、“小利服从大利，大利适当照顾小利”的原则，进行充分协商。现在，除沧县和天津两专区交界地带的水利纠纷问题正在协商解决外，其余两处地区已经修订和达成了协议，有些地方并已根据协议规定进行蓄水、排水等水利工程。
    过去发生纠纷较多的通县专区固安县与天津专区永清县和霸县邻接的一带地方。几十个村的干部和农民因历年闹纠纷耽误生产，亲友也断绝了往来。
    最近，这三个县在省委工作组的帮助下达成了协议，干部和农民都满意，有关村庄还选出代表举行了一次群众联欢会，代表们一致表示：今后要互相体谅，搞好团结，共同战胜水灾，争取今年农业大丰收。
