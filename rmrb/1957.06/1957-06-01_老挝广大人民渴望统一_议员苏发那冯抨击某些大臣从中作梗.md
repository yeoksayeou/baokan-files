　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st: Vientiane dispatch: National Assemblyman and former National Congress Chairman Phoumi Vongvichit told Agence France-Presse on May 29th that the vast majority of assemblymen and the vast majority of the Lao people hope that the agreements signed between the Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces can be fulfilled, that negotiations between the two sides can bear fruit, and that the kingdom can quickly restore unification.

　　Souphanouvong also said that there are a group of ministers in the government who superficially hope that the kingdom will restore unification, but secretly oppose unification with the support of a certain foreign country. The National Assembly welcomes neither this interference nor this opposition.

　　Souphanouvong had fiercely criticized Lao Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith in the parliament for opposing the government's efforts in resolving the Lao issue.

　　On May 29th, the National Assembly rejected Prime Minister Phouma's program for resolving the Lao issue with thirteen votes against and eleven votes for.

    老挝广大人民渴望统一
    议员苏发那冯抨击某些大臣从中作梗
    新华社河内31日电　万象消息：国民议会议员、前国民大会主席彭·苏发那冯5月29日对法新社记者说，极大多数议员和极大多数老挝人民都希望王国政府同寮国战斗部队所签订的协定能够履行，希望双方的谈判获得结果和王国能够迅速恢复统一。
    苏发那冯又说，在政府中有一批大臣们在表面上希望王国恢复统一，但是在某一个外国的支持下暗中反对统一。国民议会既不欢迎这种干涉，也不欢迎这种反对。
    苏发那冯曾经在议会猛烈抨击老挝副首相萨索里特反对政府在解决寮国问题方面所做的努力。
    5月29日的国民议会以十三票反对，十一票赞成，否决了富马首相提出的解决寮国问题的纲领。
