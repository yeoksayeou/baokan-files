　　Lebanese Parliamentary Elections Begin
　　Egyptian Newspaper Accuses U.S. of Interference
Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, June 10th: The first round of voting in the Lebanese parliamentary elections took place on June 9th in Beirut and the South Lebanon Governorate. According to unofficial results reported by Western news agencies, the pro-Western government faction led in the voting, which was conducted under heavy military guard, winning fifteen of the twenty-two seats, while the opposition won seven.
    In the Beirut district, the government faction, which the United States strongly supports, won ten of the eleven seats, while the opposition won one. Prime Minister Solh, who advocates accepting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has been elected, with more votes than his rival, opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yafi.
    The opposition accuses the government of vote rigging in the count. In Beirut, there were two incidents of clashes between supporters of the government faction and the opposition, resulting in one death and four injuries, and twenty supporters of the opposition were arrested.
    In the South Lebanon Governorate, the opposition won six of the eleven seats, while the government faction won five. According to Western news agencies, among the six elected opposition figures, three advocate strengthening cooperation with Egypt and Syria, while the other three oppose the Solh government on domestic issues but agree to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in foreign affairs.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 10th: Egypt’s "Al Shaab" (The People) newspaper said on June 9th that the United States' rush shipment of arms to Lebanon on the eve of the Lebanese elections is an urgent use of the military aspect of the Eisenhower Doctrine to suppress the Lebanese people's free expression of their will in the elections.
    The newspaper's editorial also said that this further proves that any Arab country government that enters into a covenant with foreign countries will inevitably become detached and isolated from its people and will require the import of foreign arms to deal with the people.
    "Al-Gomhuria" (The Republic) said in an editorial that the current Lebanese election is a choice between a policy of active neutrality and the Eisenhower Doctrine, between Arab nationalism and submission to foreign interventionists. The newspaper said that the Lebanese people have recently demonstrated their will to demand a free policy of active neutrality and to reject the Eisenhower Doctrine.

　　黎巴嫩议会选举开始举行
　　埃报指责美国从中干涉
    据新华社10日讯  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩议会选举的第一次投票6月9日在贝鲁特和南黎巴嫩省举行。据西方通讯社报道的非正式结果，在森严的军警戒备下进行的投票中，亲西方的政府派领先，获得了二十二席中的十五席，反对派获得了七席。
    在贝鲁特区的十一席中，美国竭力支持的政府派获得了十席，反对派获得一席。主张接受“艾森豪威尔主义”的索勒哈总理已经当选，票数超过同他竞争的反对派领袖、前总理雅非。
    反对派指责政府在计算选票中舞弊。在贝鲁特，发生了两起政府派和反对派的支持者冲突事件，结果有一人死亡，四人受伤，支持反对派的人有二十人被逮捕。
    在南黎巴嫩省，反对派获得了十一席中的六席，政府派获得五席。据西方通讯社报道，当选的六个反对派人士中，有三个主张同埃及和叙利亚加强合作，另外三个在内政问题上反对索勒哈政府，但是在外交上赞同接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    新华社开罗10日电  埃及“人民报”6月9日说，美国在黎巴嫩选举前夕把军火赶运到黎巴嫩，是紧急运用艾森豪威尔主义的军事方面来压制黎巴嫩人民在选举中自由表示意志。
    这家报纸的社论还说，这又证明，与外国公约发生关系的任何阿拉伯国家政府一定会脱离它的人民而孤立起来，并且会要求运入外国军火来对付人民。
    “共和国报”在社论中说，当前黎巴嫩的选举，是在积极的中立政策和艾森豪威尔主义之间、在阿拉伯民族主义和屈从外国干涉者之间的抉择。这家报纸说，黎巴嫩人民已经在最近表明了它们要求自由的积极中立政策、拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义的意志。
