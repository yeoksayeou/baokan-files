　　"Joke" Turns Into a Prophecy
　　Xí Línshēng
    Italian Prime Minister Zoli, who had been in office for less than a month, officially resigned on the evening of the 10th.

    On the evening of June 4th, Zoli obtained a vote of confidence in the Senate. On the morning of the 8th, news came that Zoli had also received a majority of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. But by the evening of the 10th, Zoli had submitted his resignation.

    What exactly is going on?

    It turns out that when the news of Zoli's vote of confidence was released on the morning of the 8th, someone discovered that the vote count was "wrong." The results of the review clarified that, for some reason, two votes against were counted as abstentions. Thus, the Zoli government's slim one-vote majority became a one-vote minority.

    But according to the correct statistics, 305 deputies voted in favor of Zoli in the Chamber of Deputies, which is 23 votes more than the legal majority required. So how can it be said that Zoli became a one-vote minority?

    It turns out there's more to it than that. Zoli's vote of confidence in the Senate relied on the support of the New Fascist Party and the Monarchist Party, two far-right parties most despised by the Italian people. At the time, Zoli had intended to gloss over this fact. However, this practice caused unease among many members of the Christian Democratic Party, who were worried that openly associating with Fascists and Monarchists would bring political disadvantages to the Christian Democratic Party.

    This put Zoli in a dilemma. Rejecting the support of the right-wing parties would mean not being able to form a majority, while relying on the support of these parties would have too much of a negative impact. Faced with this embarrassing situation, Zoli came up with a plan: on the eve of the confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, he declared that he would never accept the support of the New Fascist Party, to show that Zoli had severed ties with the Fascists. He estimated that under the cover of such a statement, he could secretly take advantage of the situation, borrowing only some votes from the Monarchists to win a majority.

    But Zoli's plan went wrong. In the vote in the Chamber of Deputies, 11 members of the National Monarchist Party splinter group abstained. And the votes of the New Fascist Party members accounted for 24 of the 303 votes of confidence. If these people's votes were removed, Zoli would have one vote less than the legal majority. When the results were first announced, because two votes against were counted as abstentions, Zoli could still proudly say that the majority he received was "sufficient." But after the review, it proved that there was a problem. Unless Zoli was determined to accept the "kiss of death" from the New Fascists - as a foreign news agency described it - he could no longer boast that he had obtained a majority. Since it was difficult for Zoli to go back on his word, he had to submit his resignation after "enjoying a day of victory."

    Everyone remembers that when Zoli delivered his policy address to the parliament as the new prime minister on the 29th of last month, he blurted out that his vote of confidence had been lost because the atmosphere was not good. But under the disapproving shake of the head from Foreign Minister Bella, a powerful figure in the Christian Democratic Party, he quickly explained that it was just a "joke." He obviously did not expect that in less than half a month, this "joke" would become a reality. In fact, the significance of this matter is not just that a joke unfortunately came true, but that it reflects how desperate the Italian reactionary ruling group has become in the face of the increasingly left-leaning Italian people. Now we can see what other political tricks the clerical faction, which has been holding power in Italy since the war, will come up with.

### “笑话”竟成谶语

　　“笑话”竟成谶语
　　席林生
    上台未满一个月的意大利新总理佐利于10日晚上正式辞职了。
    4日晚间佐利获得了参议院的信任票。8日早晨，消息传来佐利在众议院也得到了多数的信任。但到10日晚佐利却提出了辞职。
    这究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    原来当8日清晨佐利获得信任票消息发布后，有人发现票数的计算“错了”。复查的结果查明，由于某种原因，有两张反对票被当成弃权票了。于是佐利政府的仅仅一票的多数，就成了差一票的少数。
    但是根据正确的统计，在众议院信任投票中，赞成佐利的有三百零五票，这比法定所需的多数要多二十三票。那么又怎么说佐利成了差一票的少数呢？
    原来里面还有文章。佐利在参议院的信任票是靠了两个最受意大利人民唾弃的极右党派新法西斯党和保皇党的支持才够数的。当时佐利曾经打算把这事实含糊过去。但是这个做法引起了天主教民主党内部许多人的不安，他们担心，这样公然地同法西斯和保皇党人结缘会给天主教民主党招来政治上的大不利。
    这使佐利左右为难。拒绝右翼党派支持吧，就凑不成多数，而依靠这些党派支持，又怕影响太坏。面临这种尴尬局面，佐利心生一计，在众议院信任投票前夕，宣称他决不接受新法西斯党的支持，以表示佐利已经和法西斯分子割断了联系。他估计在这样一个声明的掩护下，可以暗度陈仓，只借保皇党人的一些票而赢取多数。
    但是偏偏佐利的算盘出了差错。在众议院投票中国家保皇党分裂派的十一个人弃了权。而新法西斯党人的票却在三百零三张信任票中占了二十四票，除去这些人的票，佐利所得信任票就比法定多数少了一票。在第一次宣布结果时，因为把两张反对票算成弃权，所以佐利还能够得意地说，他得到的多数票是“充分的”。但是在复查之后，证明其中有问题，除非佐利决心接受新法西斯党人的“死吻”——如某外国通讯社所形容的——，他就不能再吹他获得了多数。既然佐利很难收回成命，他就只得在“享受了一天的胜利”之后就提出了辞呈。
    大家记得，当上月29日佐利以新任总理身份向议会发表政纲演说时，曾经因为气氛不妙，脱口而出说过他的信任票已经失掉了。但是在天主教民主党中有势力的人物、外交部长贝拉的不以为然的摇头之下，赶紧解释说这不过是一句“笑话”。他显然没有料到，不出半月，这句“笑话”竟成了事实。其实，这件事情的意义不只是一句笑话不幸说中而已，而是它反映出，在意大利国内人民日益左倾的情况下，意大利反动统治集团已经到了如何山穷水尽的地步。现在可以看看战后一直把持着意大利政权的教权派还变出一些什么政治把戏来。
