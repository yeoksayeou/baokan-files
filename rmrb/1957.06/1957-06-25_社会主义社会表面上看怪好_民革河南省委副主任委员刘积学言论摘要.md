What's being said

　　“The socialist society looks pretty good on the surface…”
    Excerpts from the speech of Liu Jixue, Deputy Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee

    The Communist Party's successful revolution has indeed led to pride and complacency. The world was won by them, so it's understandable to feel that way. However, some things went too far. I personally have not suffered excessive oppression, but I have seen and heard of it. For example, in rural areas, some people were tortured to death with illegal means during the revolution. Some were imprisoned.

    The Chinese Communist Party has many sets of rules. The Constitution is one set, the Party Constitution is one set, the Communist Youth League Constitution is one set, and the Trade Union, the Farmers' Association, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce each have their own set. The Constitution is to restrain the 600 million people of the whole country, the Party Constitution is to restrain more than 10 million Party members, the League Constitution is to restrain more than 20 million League members... Socialism is a general direction, and everyone must move in that direction, but as you move, many problems arise, such as strikes and school boycotts. With so many sets of rules, it still cannot be guaranteed that problems will not occur.

    Some of the political work now is not done very well. Who would have thought that many students in Henan cannot go on to higher education? The socialist society looks pretty good on the surface, people's lives have improved, and culture has improved, but in fact, there are many problems.

    The CPPCC lacks cadres and funds. It can be said that the CPPCC is not valued. The funding for the provincial, municipal, and county CPPCC is only 10,000 yuan, which is unreasonable. CPPCC members have nothing to do except attend meetings as committee members.

    In the old society, it was "the poor occupy the wealth of the rich, and the rich occupy the space of the sky." Now, with the unified purchase and sale of grain, where can beggars go to beg? They can only turn around and go back.
                  (Excerpt from Henan Daily)

### “社会主义社会表面上看怪好……”  民革河南省委副主任委员刘积学言论摘要

　　“社会主义社会表面上看怪好……”
    民革河南省委副主任委员刘积学言论摘要
    共产党领导革命成功，确实骄傲自满。天下是自己打下来的，应该是这样子。可是，有些过火。我个人没有受过过火的压迫，但我所见所闻是有的。如乡间革命用非刑吊打逼死人命的都有。坐班房压起来的有。
    中国共产党工作有好多套。宪法是一套，党章是一套，团章是一套，工会、农会、工商联又各是一套。宪法是约束全国六亿人民的，党章是约束一千多万党员的，团章是约束二千多万团员的……。社会主义是个大方向，都得往这走，但你走吧，发生好多问题，罢工、罢课，有这么多套，还不能保证不出问题。
    现在有些政治做的就不太好，谁能想到河南有很多学生不能升学呢？社会主义社会表面上看怪好，人民生活提高了，文化提高了，但事实上，问题不少。
    政协方面干部缺、经费缺，可以说是不重视政协吧。省、市、县政协的经费只一万元，不成个话。政协委员没事做，光为开会当个委员。
    在旧社会是“贫占富光，富占天光”，现在粮食统购统销，要饭往那里去要，只有转一圈回去。
