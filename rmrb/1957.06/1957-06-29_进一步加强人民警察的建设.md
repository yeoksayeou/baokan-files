　　Further Strengthen the Building of the People's Police

The "Regulations of the People's Police of the People's Republic of China" were promulgated on the 26th. This is a major event in the construction of the people's police.

The people's police are an armed state security administrative force, bearing the important responsibility of punishing counter-revolutionaries according to the law, preventing and stopping the sabotage activities of other criminals, maintaining social order, and protecting the democratic rights and national interests of the people. Over the past seven years, our people's police have done very effective work and accumulated rich experience in completing the above tasks, in accordance with the law and the Constitution, and with the support of the broad masses of people. This must be affirmed. At present, with the development of the socialist transformation cause, the tasks, methods, style, management system, etc. of the people's police work must be further adapted to the needs of the situation. Therefore, based on the experience of the past seven years, and based on the current needs of socialist construction, it is necessary to formulate the nature, tasks, etc. of the people's police into provisions and affirm them in the form of law. This will not only enable the people's police to clearly understand their duties, but also enable the people to clearly understand the duties of the people's police. The promulgation of the "Regulations of the People's Police of the People's Republic of China" is precisely for this purpose.

The general task of the people's police has always been to strike at the enemy and protect the people. In the current new situation, what are the specific tasks of the people's police? This point is specifically stipulated in Article 5 of the "Regulations of the People's Police of the People's Republic of China" regarding the duties of the people's police. Summarizing these provisions, we can clearly understand the main responsibilities of the people's police, namely, fighting the enemy, maintaining social order, and seeking welfare for the people. These specific responsibilities fully embody the essence of the people's police serving the people, and these responsibilities are an inseparable whole. If we only focus on the administrative management work of maintaining social order and the work of seeking welfare for the people, and neglect the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other illegal and criminal elements, it is of course wrong. Although our large-scale class struggle has become a thing of the past, and the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and other illegal and criminal elements has been greatly reduced, there are still sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and other criminal elements in society and within organizations. Everyone knows that the imperialists allocate a large amount of money every year and set up huge spy agencies to sabotage us. Therefore, as long as imperialism exists, as long as residual counter-revolutionaries exist, the danger of counter-revolutionary sabotage exists. Therefore, we must fight against their sabotage and must not be paralyzed in the slightest. However, if we only pay attention to the struggle against the enemy and neglect the mass work of maintaining social order and caring about the people's suffering, it is equally wrong. Without good daily security management work, we cannot effectively prevent the sabotage of criminals, nor can we accurately strike at the enemy. Neglecting this aspect of work will hinder the conduct of the struggle against the enemy and will harm the interests of the people and the state. As for caring about the people's suffering, helping the masses to relieve difficulties, and seeking welfare for the people, it is determined by the nature of the people's police. Especially in the current situation where China's socialist construction is developing rapidly and the people's lives are constantly improving, the people's police should not only carry out the struggle against residual counter-revolutionaries and other criminals in depth, but also should devote more energy than in the past to helping the people do a good job in their personal welfare work. Only in this way can the people's police closely connect with the masses, rely on the assistance of the people, better perform all their duties, and complete the tasks they undertake.

To strengthen the building of the people's police, we should also further establish in all personnel the concept of closely relying on the masses, following the mass line, strictly abiding by the legal system, and handling affairs according to law. The essential difference between our people's police and the old Kuomintang police lies in the fact that the old Kuomintang police served the interests of a few reactionary rulers and oppressed the broad masses of people. Our people's police are just the opposite. They suppress the sabotage activities of a few criminals and active counter-revolutionaries, serve the broad masses of people, defend the people's democratic system, and safeguard the interests of the broad masses of people. However, because the people's police must fight against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, and must maintain public order and social security, the people's police must have certain powers and must take certain coercive measures in performing their tasks. Therefore, Article 6 of the "Regulations of the People's Police of the People's Republic of China" makes clear provisions regarding the powers of the people's police. According to these provisions, the people's police on the one hand have the necessary powers to complete their tasks, and on the other hand must cautiously use these powers according to the specific circumstances; the people's police are not allowed to exceed their powers or even abuse their powers. Therefore, strictly abiding by the law and handling affairs according to the law, especially emphasizing relying on the masses and following the mass line, is of special importance in the daily work of the people's police and in the education of the people's police.

The vast majority of our people's police are able to strictly abide by the law in performing their tasks, and have a fine style of relying on the people and following the mass line, and thus have won the love and support of the people. However, there are still a few people's police who have a privileged mentality and sometimes take simple, stiff, and even rude methods to treat the masses. Individual police officers even engage in serious illegal and undisciplined phenomena. Although this phenomenon has been continuously corrected in the past, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against these phenomena in the future.

After the promulgation and implementation of the "Regulations of the People's Police," the responsibilities of the people's police have become even greater. The state and the people have also raised their demands on them even higher. The leading aspects of public security organs at all levels and the people's police should strengthen political and ideological leadership and constantly improve the political consciousness and working ability of the people's police. In the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, we must always pay attention to overcoming various rightist and "leftist" tendencies. In performing various tasks, we must strictly abide by the legal system and handle affairs according to the law. We must be vigilant at all times and correct all bad ideological styles that are divorced from the masses. People's congresses at all levels and the people's procuratorates and people's courts must also use the powers granted to them by law to strengthen supervision over the people's police, give full play to their role in maintaining social order, protecting the people and the interests of the state, and making greater contributions to the country's socialist construction cause.

### 进一步加强人民警察的建设

　　进一步加强人民警察的建设
    中华人民共和国人民警察条例，已经在二十六日公布。这是人民警察建设中的一件大事。
    人民警察是武装性质的国家治安行政力量，担负着依法惩治反革命分子，预防、制止其他犯罪分子的破坏活动、维护社会治安、保护人民民主权益和国家利益的重大责任。七年来，我国人民警察在完成上述任务方面，依照法律和宪法，在广大群众的支持下，做了很有成效的工作，积累了丰富的经验，这是必须加以肯定的。在目前，随着社会主义改造事业的发展，人民警察工作的任务、方法、作风、管理制度等等，都必须进一步适应形势的需要。因此，根据七年来的经验，根据目前社会主义建设的需要，把人民警察的性质、任务等等制成条文，用法律的形式肯定下来，既使人民警察明确了解自己的职责，也使人民群众明确了解人民警察的职责，这是十分必要的。“中华人民共和国人民警察条例”的颁布，正是为了这个目的。
    人民警察的总任务历来是打击敌人，保护人民。在目前新的形势下，人民警察的具体任务是一些什么呢？这一点在“中华人民共和国人民警察条例”第五条各款关于人民警察的职责作了具体的规定。把这些规定概括起来，就可以清楚地认识人民警察的主要职责，即对敌斗争，维护社会治安和为人民谋福利。这些具体职责充分体现了人民警察为人民服务的本质，而这些职责又是不可分割的整体。如果只是着重维护社会治安的行政管理工作和为人民谋取福利的工作，忽略了同反革命分子和其它违法犯罪分子作斗争，当然是错误的。因为我国大规模的阶级斗争虽然已经成为过去，反革命分子和其它违法犯罪分子的破坏虽然大大地减少了，但是无论在社会上或机关内部，都还有反革命分子的破坏活动，也还有其它犯罪分子的破坏活动。大家知道，帝国主义者每年拨出了大量的款项，设置了庞大的特务机构，就是为了破坏我们。所以只要帝国主义存在，只要残余反革命分子存在，反革命破坏的危险就存在。所以必须同它们的破坏作斗争，丝毫不能麻痹。但是如果只注意了对敌斗争，忽略了维护社会治安和关心人民疾苦的群众工作，也同样是错误的。因为没有良好的日常的治安管理工作，就不能有效的防止犯罪分子的破坏，也不能准确地打击敌人。忽略这方面的工作，就会阻碍对敌斗争的进行，就会使人民和国家利益遭到危害。至于关心群众疾苦，帮助群众解除危难，为人民群众谋福利，更是人民警察的性质所决定的。尤其在当前我国社会主义建设迅速发展，人民生活不断改善的情况下，人民警察不仅要深入开展同残余的反革命分子和其它犯罪分子的斗争，而且应该比过去拿出更多的精力帮助人民群众做好切身的福利工作。只有这样，人民警察才能密切联系群众，依靠人民群众的协助，更好地执行自己的全部职责，完成自己所担负的任务。
    要加强人民警察建设，还应该在全体人员中进一步树立紧紧依靠群众，走群众路线，严格遵守法制，依法办事的观念。我们的人民警察，同国民党旧警察的本质区别，就在于国民党旧警察是为少数反动统治者的利益服务，压迫广大人民的。而我们的人民警察正好相反，他们是镇压少数犯罪分子和现行反革命的破坏活动，为广大人民群众服务，保卫人民民主的制度，维护广大人民利益的。但是由于人民警察要同反革命分子和其它犯罪分子进行斗争，要维护公共秩序和社会治安，人民警察在执行任务中，就必须拥有一定的权限，必须采取某些强制手段。因此，“中华人民共和国人民警察条例”第六条关于人民警察的权限作了明确规定。按照这些规定，人民警察一方面拥有完成任务的必要权限，另一方面又必须根据具体情况审慎地运用这些权限；不允许人民警察超越权限以至滥用职权。因此，在人民警察的日常工作中和对人民警察的教育中严格遵守法律，依法办事，特别是强调依靠群众，走群众路线，有特殊重要的意义。
    我国人民警察中绝大多数人员，在执行任务中是能够严格地遵守法律的，并具有依靠人民群众，走群众路线的优良作风，因而获得了人民群众的爱戴和拥护。但还有少数的人民警察，却有一种特权思想，有时采取简单生硬，以至粗暴的办法对待群众，个别民警，甚至发生严重的违法乱纪现象。这种现象，虽然过去曾不断地进行纠正，但是今后仍须同这些现象作坚决的斗争。
    人民警察条例颁布施行后，人民警察的责任更加重大了。国家和人民对他们的要求也更加提高了。各级公安机关和人民警察的领导方面应该加强政治思想领导，不断地提高人民警察的政治觉悟和工作能力。在同反革命分子和其它犯罪分子的斗争中，要经常注意克服各种右的和“左”的倾向。在执行各种任务中，都要严格遵守法制，依法办事。要时时刻刻警惕和纠正一切脱离群众的不良思想作风。各级人民代表大会和人民检察院、人民法院，也必须运用法律所给予自己的权力，加强对人民警察监督，充分发挥他们维护社会治安，保障人民群众和国家利益的作用，为国家的社会主义建设事业，作出更大的贡献。
