    "Busy Season Canteen"
    The Sixth Production Team of the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, has restored the "Busy Season Canteen" in order to solve the problems of labor shortages and firewood scarcity during the busy farming season. This team ran a "Busy Season Canteen" for four months last year. By reducing the number of stoves and cooks, more than 30 households saved more than 1,000 workdays and more than 16,000 jin of firewood, and also reduced a lot of housework burden on the commune members (especially women and bachelors). When it was restored this year, some members of the Fifth Team also joined the canteen, and the rest of the teams also requested or were considering establishing one.
    This canteen was established in the spirit of thrift. It used soil bricks to build a stove, borrowed a large pot and still used for winemaking in the past from the commune members. The jars, bowls, etc. were brought by the commune members themselves. The cooperative only spent 16 yuan and 4 jiao to repair the still and purchase necessary small utensils.
    This kind of canteen is different from the "eating from the big pot" as rumored in the past, nor is it "averaging the rice, competing in eating." It is organized based on the principle of voluntariness. The commune members who participate in the canteen first exchange grain for meal tickets, and then use the tickets for meals. The amount of rice can be reserved, and it can be returned when not needed. Commune members bring their own side dishes, and the canteen steams them for them. The commune members are very satisfied.

### “农忙食堂”

    “农忙食堂”
    湖北武昌县三联农业社的第六生产队，为了解决农忙季节劳力紧张和烧柴缺乏的问题，恢复了“农忙食堂”。这个队在去年曾办了四个月的“农忙食堂”，由于减少锅灶和烧饭的人，三十多户人家共节省出一千多个工作日和一万六千多斤烧柴，并减轻了社员（特别是妇女和单身汉）很多家务牵累。今年恢复时，第五队部分社员也参加了这个食堂，其余的队也都要求或酝酿建立。
    这个食堂是本着节约精神建立的，用土砖砌了个灶，向社员借用了过去烧酒用的大锅和酒甑，缸、碗等都由社员自带，社里只花了十六元四角钱修理甑和购买必需的小用具。
    这种食堂和过去所传说的“吃大锅饭”不同，也不是什么“平把米，赛吃饭”，它是根据自愿原则组织起来的。参加食堂的社员先用粮食换取饭票，然后凭票用饭。用多少饭可以预约，不用时还可以退掉。小菜由社员自带，食堂代蒸。社员非常满意。  彭泽国
