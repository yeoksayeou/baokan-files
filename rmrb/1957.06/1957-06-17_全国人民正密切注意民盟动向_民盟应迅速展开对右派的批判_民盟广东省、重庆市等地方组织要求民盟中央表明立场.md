　　The Whole Nation is Closely Watching the Movements of the China Democratic League
　　The China Democratic League Should Swiftly Launch Criticism of the Rightists
　　Local Organizations of the China Democratic League in Guangdong Province, Chongqing City and other places Demand the Central Committee of the China Democratic League State its Position
　　The Attitude of the China Democratic League Must Be Clear in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
　　The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League Sends a Telegram to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th - The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League held an enlarged meeting of its standing committee on the 15th. After discussion, it sent a telegram to the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, suggesting that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League should clearly point out that the remarks of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Ye Duyi, Chen Xingui, Chu Anping and others are anti-socialist erroneous remarks, and solemnly express that the China Democratic League resolutely accepts the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, consolidates the people's democratic dictatorship, and supports socialism. The telegram also suggested that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League should notify its subordinate organizations throughout the country to launch criticism of the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun and others, and draw a clear ideological line. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League should strengthen the education and assistance to Zhang Bojun and others, and require them to conduct in-depth self-criticism and correct their mistakes.
　　During the discussion at the meeting, Hu Yisheng, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, pointed out that the people who support socialism must wage a fierce ideological struggle against the new situation of the rightists launching ideological attacks on the working class. He said that in this struggle, the banner of the China Democratic League must be clear, and the attitude of the members must also be clear, no matter which side they stand on.
　　Lou Qi, a standing committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, expressed his pain over the fact that some responsible persons of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League would utter anti-socialist remarks. He said that since the Central Committee of the Communist Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the democratic parties, the thinking of some members of the China Democratic League has become confused, and some people have even proposed that the China Democratic League should have its own direction and should be different from the Communist Party. He pointed out that long-term coexistence cannot be separated from the foundation of socialism. It is intolerable that some responsible persons of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League have remarks that deviate from the socialist road. He also said that we help the Communist Party in rectification with the attitude of friends and out of love for the Communist Party, in order to better carry out socialist construction, not to confront the Communist Party on an equal footing.
　　Wei Junpei criticized Zhang Bojun's proposal to establish a so-called "Political Design Institute" in his speech. He said that the essence of this proposal is to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, to deviate from the socialist principle, and to violate the provisions of the Constitution. He pointed out that Zhang Bojun's proposal was not made on a whim, but has its consistent ideological roots. Zhang Bojun had proposed a bicameral system in the past, and now he proposes that the democratic parties should develop to two million members and establish an upper house. He says he supports socialism, but in fact he opposes socialism. Wei Junpei expressed his support for Shi Liang's speech at the group discussion of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and opposed doing one thing in public and another in private. He believes that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League must find out the supporters behind the speeches of Chu Anping and others.
　　Huang Rongzeng, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that recently the rightists have taken advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to peddle their anti-Party and anti-socialist things. After listing some of the erroneous remarks recently exposed in the newspapers, he said, "A few days ago, I agreed with some of their views and thought that the publication of the 'People's Daily' editorial was premature. Now it seems that the situation is getting worse and worse. The rightists are frantically attacking. If we don't speak out, it is tantamount to helping them. We must resolutely counter these fallacies."
　　Guo Qiaoran, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting that Zhang Bojun had revealed to him the idea of establishing an upper house and implementing a bicameral system. He expressed his determination to draw a clear line with these ideas that deviate from the socialist road.
　　Responsible persons of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League believe that the remarks of Zhang Bojun and others
　　are attempts to weaken the Party's leading core role
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th - "Chongqing Daily" today published the talks of Xiao Huaqing, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Jin Xiru and Li Jiazhong, Deputy Chairmen, in which they refuted the erroneous remarks of Zhang Bojun and others and demanded that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League quickly express its attitude.
　　Xiao Huaqing and others believe that the remarks of some responsible persons of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chen Xingui, and Chu Anping, editor-in-chief of "Guangming Daily", are extremely wrong. The essence of the remarks of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji shows their doubt about the leading core role of the Communist Party in national affairs, and their attempt to weaken the play of this core role. It is not accidental that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji made these remarks. They verbally admit the socialist road, the leadership of the Party, and the people's democratic dictatorship, but in the depths of their minds, the bourgeois political direction and bourgeois democracy have not been completely criticized and transformed, and they will revive at the first opportunity. They are both Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and responsible persons of the country. The impact of their remarks is very harmful.
　　Xiao Huaqing and others believe that the arguments put forward by Chu Anping that "the Party's world is the root of sectarianism" and by Chen Xingui that "the proletarian dictatorship is the root of sectarianism" are even more vicious attempts to abolish the Party's leadership and the proletarian dictatorship, and to fundamentally shake the socialist cause. If these absurd remarks are not refuted to distinguish right from wrong, as a member of the League, he has not fulfilled his just position of defending socialism, firmly accepting the leadership of the Party, and safeguarding the people's democratic dictatorship.
　　Xiao Huaqing and others believe that the people of the whole country are now closely watching the movements of the political and ideological struggle being carried out by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. We don't have to hide it. Since its establishment, the China Democratic League has gone through countless struggles between the left and the right, and between right and wrong in the past sixteen years. After liberation, this struggle has never stopped. Each struggle has been won by the broad masses of League members who resolutely follow the Communist Party. And this struggle is being carried out with the care and support of the people of the whole country. As long as we adhere to the socialist position, distinguish right from wrong, the attempt of a few rightists to lead the China Democratic League to the right will surely fail.
　　Xiao Huaqing and others requested the Central Committee of the China Democratic League to immediately express a solemn attitude to the people of the whole country and all members of the League, draw a clear line between right and wrong, and give sincere help to those who have committed political errors, so that they can recognize and correct their errors.
　　Local organizations of the China Democratic League in Liaoning and Shenyang demand
　　Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji should make a thorough confession
　　This newspaper, Shenyang, 16th - The absurd remarks made recently by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and others against the leadership of the Communist Party and against socialism have aroused great indignation among the Liaoning China Democratic League organizations and members. At the symposium jointly organized by the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League on June 13, and at the symposium of members of the China Democratic League of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics on June 15, many members sharply criticized the erroneous remarks of Zhang, Luo and others. On the 16th, the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League jointly sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, demanding that Zhang Bojun and others quickly state their attitude and make an account of their erroneous remarks. The telegram said: "During the period of helping the Party to carry out the rectification movement, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chen Xingui, and Chu Anping made absurd remarks against the leadership of the Party, against the people's democratic dictatorship system, and against the socialist construction cause, causing extremely bad influence. The people of the whole country are engaged in a fierce ideological struggle with the rightists, and are closely watching the attitude and political movements of our League, which has aroused universal indignation among the broad masses of League members. Therefore, the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee request the Central Committee to quickly state its attitude towards these fallacies that harm the interests of the people and tarnish the glorious tradition of our League, clarify the confused thinking, and clarify the direction of the League; demand that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji clearly state their position on this serious ideological struggle, and make a thorough account of their erroneous words and deeds."

　　全国人民正密切注意民盟动向
    民盟应迅速展开对右派的批判
　　民盟广东省、重庆市等地方组织要求民盟中央表明立场
　　在反右派斗争中民盟态度要鲜明
　　民盟广东省委致电民盟中央
    据新华社广州16日电　中国民主同盟广东省委员会15日举行的常委扩大会议，经过了讨论以后，向民盟中央常务委员会发出了一份电报，建议民盟中央明确指出章伯钧、罗隆基、叶笃义、陈新桂、储安平等人的言论是反社会主义的错误言论，并严正表示民盟坚决接受中国共产党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，拥护社会主义。电报中还建议民盟中央通知全国所属组织展开对章伯钧等人错误言论的批判，划清思想界限；民盟中央应加强对章伯钧等人的教育和帮助，要求他们深入检查，改正错误。
    在会议进行讨论的时候，民盟广东省委副主任委员胡一声指出，现在面临着右派分子向工人阶级进行思想进攻的新形势，拥护社会主义的人民一定要同他们作激烈的思想斗争。他说，在这一斗争中，民盟的旗帜要鲜明，盟员无论站在那一面，态度也要鲜明。
    民盟广东省委常务委员楼栖对民盟中央有些负责人竟会发出反社会主义言论表示痛心。他说，自从共产党中央提出了与民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针以后，民盟有些盟员的思想产生了混乱，有人竟然提出民盟应有自己的方向，应同共产党有所不同。他指出，长期共存不能离开社会主义这一基础。民盟的一些中央负责人竟然有离开社会主义道路的言论，实在不能令人容忍。他又说，我们以朋友的身份，本着爱护共产党的态度帮助共产党整风，是为了更好地进行社会主义建设，而不是要和共产党分庭抗礼，平起平坐。
    魏均沛在发言中批判了章伯钧提出的成立所谓“政治设计院”的主张。他说，这个主张的实质是取消共产党的领导，是离开社会主义原则，违反宪法规定的。他指出，章伯钧的这个主张不是一时凭灵感提出来的，有其一贯的思想根源。章伯钧过去就曾经提出过两院制，现在更提出要民主党派发展到二百万成员，成立上议院。他口头上说拥护社会主义，实际上是反对社会主义。魏均沛表示支持史良在民盟中央小组座谈会上的发言，反对表面一套，背地里一套。他认为民盟中央必须把储安平等人发言的背后支持者查明。
    民盟广州市委员会副主任委员黄榕增说，最近右派分子钻共产党整风的空子，贩卖他们那些反党、反社会主义的东西。他列举了最近报上揭露的一些错误言论以后说，早几天我还同意他们的一些说法，认为“人民日报”发表社论为时过早，现在看起来，形势愈来愈不对了。右派分子疯狂进攻，如果我们不说话就等于帮助了他们。我们必须对这些谬论作坚决的反击。
    民盟广东省委员会副主任委员郭翘然在会上说，章伯钧曾向他透露过搞一个上议院、实行两院制的想法。他表示要和这些离开社会主义道路的思想划清界限。
　　民盟重庆市委负责人认为章伯钧等人的言论
　　是企图削弱党的领导核心作用
    据新华社重庆16日电　“重庆日报”今天发表了民盟重庆市委员会主任委员萧华清、副主任委员金锡如、李嘉仲等人的谈话，他们在谈话中批驳了章伯钧等人的错误言论，要求民盟中央迅速表示态度。
    萧华清等人认为：在民盟中央的一些负责人如章伯钧、罗隆基、陈新桂和“光明日报”总编辑储安平等人的言论是极其错误的。民盟副主席章伯钧和罗隆基的言论的实质，表现了对共产党在国家事务中领导核心作用的怀疑，企图削弱这种核心作用的发挥。章伯钧和罗隆基发出这些言论并不是偶然的，他们在口头上承认社会主义的道路，承认党的领导和人民民主专政，但在思想深处，资产阶级的政治方向和资产阶级的民主并没有完全受到批判和改造，一有机会便又死灰复燃。他们都是民盟中央的副主席，同时也是国家的负责人，发出这些言论其影响所及，为害匪浅。
    萧华清等人认为，至于储安平所提出的“党天下是宗派主义产生的根源”和陈新桂提出的“无产阶级专政是宗派主义产生的根源”这些论调，更恶毒地企图取消党的领导和无产阶级专政，从根本上来动摇社会主义事业。这些荒谬言论，如不予以驳斥，而达到明辨是非，作为一个盟员来说，则没有尽到捍卫社会主义、坚定地接受党的领导，和维护人民民主专政的正义立场。
    萧华清等人认为，全国人民现在正密切地注意民盟中央正在开展的政治思想斗争中的动向。我们也不必隐讳，民盟自成立以来，十六年间，左派和右派，正确与错误，曾进行过无数次的斗争。解放后，这种斗争也一直没有停止过。每一次的斗争，都是坚决跟着共产党走的广大盟员群众取得了胜利。而这一次斗争，更是在全国人民的关怀和支持下进行的，只要我们坚守社会主义的立场，明辨是非，少数右派分子把民盟引向右转的企图一定会遭到失败。
    萧华清等人要求民盟中央委员会立即向全国人民和全体盟员表明严正的态度，划清是非界限，对犯政治错误的人给予诚恳的帮助，使他们能认识错误和改正错误。
　　民盟辽宁和沈阳地方组织要求
　　章伯钧、罗隆基要作彻底交代
    本报沈阳16日电　章伯钧、罗隆基等最近发表的反对共产党领导、反对社会主义的荒谬言论，引起辽宁民盟组织和成员的极大愤慨。在6月13日民盟辽宁省委和沈阳市委联合组织的座谈会上，6月15日东北财经学院民盟成员的座谈会上，许多盟员尖锐地批判章、罗等人的错误言论。16日，民盟辽宁省委和沈阳市委又联名打电报给民盟中央，要求章伯钧等人迅速表明态度，对他们的错误言论作出交代。电文说：“在帮助党进行整风运动期间，章伯钧、罗隆基、陈新桂、储安平发表了反对党的领导、反对人民民主专政制度、反对社会主义建设事业的荒谬言论，造成极端恶劣的影响。全国人民在与右派分子进行剧烈的思想斗争中，正密切注意着本盟的态度和政治上的动向，在广大盟员群众中间引起了普遍的愤激。为此，辽宁省委员会和沈阳市委员会要求中央委员会对这些危害人民利益、污损本盟光荣传统的谬论，迅速表明态度，澄清混乱思想，明确盟的动向；要求章伯钧和罗隆基二人，对当前这场严肃的思想斗争，明确表明立场，对自己的错误言行作彻底的交代。”
