Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 23rd -- Today, ten thousand workers in Changchun braved the heavy rain to gather at the Workers' Stadium to hold a meeting, expressing their determination to resolutely repel the attack of the bourgeois right-wingers and defend the achievements of socialism.

Wang Mingde, chairman of the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, spoke first at the meeting. When he spoke about the rampant attacks on socialism and the Communist Party by Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, and others, he pointed out that anti-socialist and anti-Communist Party leadership remarks have also appeared in Jilin Province. He called on all workers in the province to unite closely and defeat the rampant attacks of the right-wingers, and to strive for socialist construction with practical actions of actively developing the advanced producer movement and completing the production increase and thrift plan. All workers in the stadium responded with warm applause.

Xu Zhaojun, a worker from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said excitedly that the right-wingers deny the achievements of our country's construction. He asked them to think about how, in the era of reactionary rule, not a single car was manufactured in China. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to build an automobile factory, the motherland's first automobile factory was built in less than three years. Now, all the factory's employees are working hard to complete the production tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan ahead of schedule, and to increase production and save the equivalent of five hundred cars this year.

Yang Fengxi, a 53-year-old veteran worker from the Changchun Cigarette Factory, said, "Thinking about the past, we ate acorn flour, wore coarse cloth, and life got worse year after year. After the Communist Party came, we workers became masters. Although our country is not rich yet, the people's lives have improved considerably. Take me, for example, a family of seven eats rice and white flour, with vegetables at every meal. One of my children is studying at university, one is in high school, and even I have become a middle school student in the factory's night school." Yang Fengxi said, "Who gave us these good times? It was the Communist Party. The right-wingers vainly attempt to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and overthrow the regime led by the working class. I firmly oppose it!"

Representatives of workers in the construction industry and joint state-private enterprises also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their intention to defend socialism with practical actions of increasing production and practicing thrift.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 23rd -- Yesterday afternoon, more than 1,200 employees in Anshan gathered to angrily condemn the various anti-socialist fallacies of the bourgeois right-wingers.

Huang Demao, Anshan's special-class labor model and director of the steel bar forming workshop of the Industrial Construction Company, spoke first, saying that the right-wingers' attempt to obliterate the achievements of our country's socialist construction is blatant nonsense. We ask them to open their eyes and take a look at Anshan Iron and Steel. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we not only restored Anshan Iron and Steel, but the steel production has long exceeded the highest level during the Japanese fascist occupation. Then, he refuted Long Yun's anti-Soviet fallacies with the facts of building Anshan Iron and Steel. He said that when we built Anshan Iron and Steel, we had no experience, no technical knowledge, and the Soviet Union sent experts to teach us; the equipment we could not manufacture was supplied by the Soviet Union; we could not design, and the Soviet Union helped us; and they also helped us train a large number of technicians, managers, and workers. Which capitalist country can give us so much help?

Ma Dezeng, an old lady and warehouse keeper at the Anshan Iron and Steel Supply Department, refuted Ge Peiqi's fallacy that only a few party cadres have improved their lives with the facts of her own life changes. She said: In the old society, my husband worked for the landlord and became ill from exhaustion, lying in bed all year round. The whole family relied on me alone to grow some vegetable gardens to make a living, and we often ate vegetable dumplings to fill our stomachs with tears in our eyes. After liberation, I became a warehouse keeper at Anshan Iron and Steel, and my salary has increased year by year. Now I have more than fifty yuan a month, not only is the whole family not worried about food and clothing, but my son has also entered middle school, and my husband also enjoys labor insurance for medical treatment.

Sun Zhaosen, chief engineer of the Second Electrical Installation Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction, as well as young steelmaking workers, design technicians, and others, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously refuted the anti-socialist fallacies of the bourgeois right-wingers, and expressed their intention to counterattack the right-wingers with the practical action of producing more steel.

    长春万名工人举行反右派大会
    鞍山市职工痛斥龙云反苏谬论
    新华社长春23日电　长春市今天有一万名工人冒着大雨赶到工人体育场举行大会，表示要坚决打退资产阶级右派分子的进攻，保卫社会主义的成就。
    吉林省工会联合会主席王明德在会上首先讲话。他在讲到章伯钧、章乃器等向社会主义和共产党猖狂进攻的情况时指出，吉林省也出现了反对社会主义、反对共产党的领导的言论。他号召全省工人紧密团结起来，打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻；并且以积极开展先进生产者运动和完成增产节约计划的实际行动来努力进行社会主义建设。全场工人报以热烈的掌声。
    第一汽车制造厂工人徐兆俊激动地说，右派分子否认我们国家建设的成就，请他们想一想在反动统治年代里，中国一辆汽车也没有制造出来。自从党中央发出建设汽车厂的号召后，不到三年祖国第一座汽车厂建成了。现在，全厂职工正在为提前完成第一个五年计划规定的生产任务和今年增产节约价值五百辆汽车的任务而紧张劳动。
    五十三岁的长春制烟厂老工人杨凤兮说，想想过去，我们吃的是橡子面，穿的是更生布，生活一年不如一年；共产党来了，我们工人作了主人。我们国家现在虽然还不富裕，但是人民生活已经有了相当改善。就拿我来说，七口之家，吃的是大米白面，顿顿有菜。我的孩子有一个念大学，一个念高中，就连我现在也成了工厂夜校的中学生了。杨凤兮说，这些好光景谁给我们的？是共产党。右派分子妄想反对共产党的领导，推翻工人阶级领导的政权，我坚决反对！
    在会上发言的还有建筑业、公私合营企业职工的代表。他们一致表示，用增产节约的实际行动来保卫社会主义。
    新华社鞍山23日电　昨天下午，鞍山市一千二百多名职工集会，愤怒谴责资产阶级右派分子的各种反社会主义谬论。
    鞍山市特等劳动模范、工业建筑公司钢筋成型车间主任黄德茂首先发言说，右派分子企图抹煞我国社会主义建设事业的成就，是闭着眼睛说瞎话，我们请他们睁开眼睛来看看鞍钢。在共产党的领导下，我们不但恢复了鞍钢，而且钢铁产量早就超过了日本法西斯侵占时期的最高水平。接着，他又用建设鞍钢的事实，驳斥了龙云的反苏谬论。他说，在建设鞍钢时，我们没有经验，不懂技术，苏联派来了专家教我们；我们不能制造的设备是苏联供应的；我们不能设计苏联帮助我们；还帮助我们培养了大批的技术人员、管理人员和工人，请问那个资本主义国家能给予我们这样多的帮助？
    鞍钢供应处守库员马德增老太太以她自己生活变化的事实，驳斥葛佩琦说生活提高的只是少数党员干部的谬论，她说：在旧社会中我的丈夫给地主扛活累病了，成年躺在床上，全家指望我一个人种些菜园子度日，我们经常含着眼泪吃菜团子充饥。解放后，我当了鞍钢的守库员，工资逐年提高，现在每月有五十多元，不仅全家不愁吃穿，儿子也进了中学，丈夫看病还享受了劳保待遇。
    在会上发言的还有建设鞍钢的电气安装第二公司总工程师孙兆森以及青年炼钢工人、设计技术员等，他们一致驳斥了资产阶级右派分子的反社会主义的谬论，表示要以多生产钢铁的实际行动来回击右派分子。
