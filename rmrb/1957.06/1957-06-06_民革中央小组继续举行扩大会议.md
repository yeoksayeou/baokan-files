The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) continued its expanded meeting on the morning of June 5th.  Those who spoke at the meeting included Li Renren, Standing Committee Member of the RCCK Central Committee, Zhou Ying, Central Committee Member, and Tan Tiwu, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee.

Li Renren said: While the Communist Party's rectification is certainly good, if the legal system is incomplete, there is still no guarantee, and the people have no basis to judge whether the Communist Party is doing things correctly.

Li Renren is the Vice Governor of Guangxi Province. In his speech, he first talked about the "blooming" and "contending" situation in Guangxi Province. He said that every time he came to the Central Committee for a meeting, he heard Minister Li Weihan say that the Party and government should be separated, but that was not the case at the lower levels. It was better in the province, but the problem became more serious as one went further down. The district party secretary and the township party branch secretary could order everything.

He also said that the leadership of the Party and the identity of Party members should be distinguished. The Party should not be equated with its members. The Party's leadership is stipulated by the Constitution, and no one doubts it, but every Party member is not equal to the Party. In some agencies and schools, people who offer opinions to Party members are criticized as being anti-Party and anti-organization. Isn't this even worse than "I am the state"?

Finally, he suggested that if the RCCK has proposals and speeches at the upcoming National People's Congress meeting, it should emphasize the establishment of the legal system. He said that while the Communist Party's rectification is certainly good, if the legal system is incomplete, there is still no guarantee, and the people have no basis to judge whether the Communist Party is doing things correctly.

Zhou Ying believes: Some major issues within the Communist Party are locked in a "safe," and must be attacked from both inside and outside to break through.

In her speech, Zhou Ying raised some opinions based on the actual situation of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. She said that the comrades in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had exposed many problems, which they were unaware of. Some problems, such as the undemocratic work style and paternalistic leadership style of certain leading comrades, should have been exposed within the Party long ago. Why hadn't they been exposed all along? Didn't the Party members know about them? Didn't the Party members have any opinions? No. She believed that this was because the Party's criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, had not been carried out, and intra-Party democracy had not been well-developed. Insufficient development of intra-Party democracy would inevitably affect the inability to promote democracy well outside the Party.

Zhou Ying also said that in past movements, Communist Party members had always been at the forefront, why were Communist Party members now "sitting back and waiting"? She demanded that Communist Party members "come out immediately." She also believed that some major issues within the Communist Party were locked in a "safe," and these problems must be exposed by responsible Party cadres, and must be attacked from both inside and outside to break through.

Zhou Ying said, what should the democratic parties do during this period? She believed that an organization should be established in the organs, with the participation of the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, the Trade Union, and the democratic parties. She said that during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the democratic parties were indifferent and did not offer any opinions. When members of the RCCK were struggled against, their own organization stood by idly. Now, in the rectification movement, they should change their work style and bravely do what they should do, and share responsibilities with the Communist Party. This organization should be responsible for studying the problems exposed by the masses, proposing solutions, and supervising the Communist Party to solve the problems more quickly. She demanded that the entire RCCK Central Committee also consider what to do. She also mentioned that the students of the Socialist Academy generally believed that the work done by the democratic parties in recent years mainly consisted of: singing praises, gilding the lily, and adding fuel to the fire. Therefore, she believed that the democratic parties also bore responsibility for the criticisms made of the Communist Party in this rectification.

Tan Tiwu said: The Communist Party directly issues orders to the people, but government departments have no power. The Party directly commanding Party members will throw the country into chaos. She believed that a separate Party system should not be established outside the government.

Tan Tiwu raised four questions. The first was the way the Communist Party leads the country. She said that everyone recognizes that the Party leads the country, but the method used is worth studying. Now there is a set of government institutions, and there is also a set of institutions within the Party, which is a "dual-track system." She said that the set within the Party is monolithic, not together with the masses, and divorced from reality. How can this not lead to the three major isms and "walls" and "trenches"? It was originally said that the Party was grasping ideology and policy, but it has actually gone beyond this scope, directly issuing orders to the people, but government departments have no power. She believed that the joint issuance of instructions by the Party Central Committee and the State Council was because the State Council's independent issuance of instructions was ineffective. She said that since our country is led by the working class, why not use our own dictatorship institutions, but weaken their powers and establish a separate Party system outside the government? She hoped that the CPC Central Committee would consider whether doing so is in line with China's national conditions.

Then she put forward specific suggestions on the way the Party leads the country: The Chairman's Office should be expanded; the institutions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should be strengthened, and its role should be brought into play; Communist Party members should come to this power organ to supervise the government and grasp policies; various departments within the Communist Party should be changed into various committees in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; a Party group can be set up within the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to absorb non-Party members to participate in the work.

The second issue she talked about was: How should the Party's policies be reflected? She said that the Party directly commanding Party members would throw the country into chaos. She believed that the Party should raise policies to the National People's Congress to make them into laws, and then the state administrative organs should formulate various decrees based on the laws, and implement the Party's policies through the implementation of laws and decrees. She believed that internal instructions should not be issued outside of laws and decrees. She emphasized that it is not permissible to replace laws and decrees with instructions.

Tan Tiwu said: Does the Communist Party want to make the country stable and lasting, or is it creating chaos itself? She also said that the Communist Party can send Party members to judicial, procuratorial, and other organs to take charge of leading work, but these departments should not be led by the Party committee.

The third issue is the Party's compliance with the Constitution and the national system. She said that the Party's policies should be formulated within the scope of the Constitution. Here, she once again raised the issue of the transformation of real estate developers in Shanghai as a violation of the Constitution. Tan Tiwu requested the CPC Central Committee to check whether there are any conflicts between the policies formulated and the Constitution? If so, correct them quickly. She said that in the past, not complying with the law was for the purpose of overthrowing the regime. Does the Communist Party today want to make the country stable and lasting, or is it creating chaos itself? She believed that this is not a small matter, and the Communist Party must abide by the Constitution.

Regarding the national system, Tan Tiwu said that the judiciary, lawyers, and procuratorate play a leverage role in the implementation of the national system, but in some places these three are under the leadership of one Party committee, which she believed is not good. Someone in the audience asked her at the time: Is the judiciary, lawyers, and procuratorate under the leadership of one Party committee, led by one Party member, or by the Party committee? She replied that she did not know. Tan Tiwu believed that the Communist Party can send Party members to judicial, procuratorial, and other organs to take charge of leading work, but these departments should not be led by the Party committee.

The fourth question is how to make the Communist Party accept the supervision of the people of the whole country. She said that the government is supervised by the People's Congress, but the Party is not subject to any supervision. She believed that a system should be established to enable the people to supervise the Communist Party.

Li Jishen finally said that in order to help the Communist Party eliminate the "three evils," don't worry about hurting or not hurting the Party, everyone should speak as much as possible, and this meeting will continue. He agreed with Zhou Ying's opinion that the speeches at the meeting should be summarized and submitted to the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee in the future.

### 民革中央小组继续举行扩大会议

    民革中央小组继续举行扩大会议
    本报讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央小组于6月5日上午继续举行扩大会议。在会上发言的有民革中央常务委员李任仁、中央委员周颖和中央常务委员谭惕吾。
    李任仁说：共产党整风固然很好，但如果法制不完备，仍然没有保证，人民没有根据来权衡共产党作得对不对。
    李任仁是广西省副省长，他在发言中首先谈到广西省“鸣”“放”的情况，他说，每次到中央来开会都听到李维汉部长说党政要分开，但是到下面就不然，在省里还好一点，愈到下面愈成问题，区委书记和乡支书就可命令一切。
    他还说应该把党的领导和党员的身份区别开来，不能在党和党员之间划等号。党的领导是宪法规定的，无人怀疑，但每个党员并不等于党。有的机关、学校中有人给党员提意见，竟被批评为是反党反组织，这不是比“朕即国家”还有过之吗？
    最后他建议民革在即将召开的全国人民代表大会会议上，如有提案和发言，要强调建立法制。他说，共产党整风固然很好，但如果法制不完备，仍然没有保证，人民没有根据来权衡共产党作得对不对。
    周颖认为：共产党内有些重大问题被锁在“保险柜”内，必须内外夹攻才攻得出来。
    周颖在发言中联系邮电部的实际情况提了一些意见。她说，这次邮电部的同志们揭发了很多问题，这些问题我们都不知道，有些问题，比如某些领导同志作风不民主，家长式的领导问题，我认为早就应该在党内揭发出来的，为什么一直没有揭发呢？难道党员同志不知道吗？难道党员同志就没有意见吗？不是的。我认为这是由于党内的批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评不开展，党内民主没有很好发扬的关系。党内民主发扬不够，势必影响到党外也不能很好的发扬民主。
    周颖又说，过去历次运动中都是共产党员打冲锋，现在共产党员为什么“坐阵以待”？她要求共产党员“立即出马”。她还认为，共产党内有些重大问题被锁在“保险柜”内，这些问题必须党的负责干部出来揭发，必须党内外夹攻才能攻得出来。
    周颖说，在现在这个时期，民主党派应该作些什么呢？她认为在机关应该成立一个组织，这个组织有共产党、共青团、工会、民主党派参加。她说，在肃反运动中，我们民主党派不闻不问，不提意见，民革的成员被斗争，自己的组织袖手旁观。现在在整风运动中，我们应该改变作风，该作的要勇敢地去作，要和共产党分担责任。这个组织要负责把群众揭露出来的问题加以研究，提出处理的意见，监督共产党快一些解决问题。她要求整个民革中央也应该考虑怎么办的问题。她还谈到社会主义学院的学员相当普遍认为，民主党派这几年干的工作主要是：歌功颂德、锦上添花、火上加油。因此她认为，这次整风中对共产党提出的批评，民主党派也负有责任。
    谭惕吾说：共产党直接向人民发号施令，政府部门却没有权。党直接指挥党员，会把国家搞乱。她认为不应在政权之外再搞一套党的系统。
    谭惕吾提出了四个问题。第一个是共产党领导国家的方式问题。她说，党领导国家，大家承认，但用什么方式值得研究。现在政府有一套机构，党内又有一套机构，这是“双轨制度”。她说，党内一套是清一色，不与群众在一起，脱离实际，这怎会不产生三大主义和“墙”“沟”。原说党是抓思想和政策的，实际上已超越这个范围，直接向人民发号施令，政府部门却没有权。她认为党中央和国务院联合发指示，是由于国务院单独发指示不起作用。她说，既然我们的国家是工人阶级领导的，为什么自己专政的机构不用，而要削弱其职权，另在政权之外来搞一套党的系统呢？她希望中共中央考虑这样做是否合乎中国国情。
    接着她就党领导国家的方式问题提出了具体建议：主席办公室应该扩大；全国人民代表大会常务委员会的机构要充实，要发挥它的作用，共产党员到这个权力机关来监督政府，掌握政策；把共产党内各个部改为全国人民代表大会常委会里的各种委员会；在全国人民代表大会常委会内可以设党组，吸收非党人士参加工作。
    她谈的第二个问题是：党的政策应该如何体现。她说，党直接指挥党员，会把国家搞乱了。她认为党应该把政策提到人民代表大会制成法律，再由国家管理机关根据法律制成各种法令，通过法律、法令的实施，体现党的政策。她认为不应在法律、法令之外，再发内部指示。她强调说，指示代替法律、法令，是不可以的。
    谭惕吾说：共产党是想使国家长治久安呢？还是自己捣自己的乱呢？又说，共产党可以派党员到司法、检察等机关去担任负责工作，但这些部门不应该受党委领导。
    第三个是党遵守宪法和国家制度问题。她说，党制定政策，应在宪法范围之内。在这里，她再一次提出了上海对房产商的改造问题是违反宪法的。谭惕吾要求中共中央检查在制定的政策中是否和宪法有抵触的？如有，要赶快纠正。她说，过去不遵守法律是为着推翻政权才不遵守它。共产党今天是想使国家长治久安呢？还是自己捣自己的乱？她认为这不是小事情，共产党必须遵守宪法。
    关于国家制度问题，谭惕吾说，司法、律师、检察是对执行国家制度起杠杆作用的，但在有些地方这三者是在一个党委领导之下，她认为这是不好的。会场当时有人问她：司法、律师、检察在一个党委领导之下，是受一个党员领导，还是受党委会的领导。她回答说她不知道。谭惕吾认为，共产党可以派党员到司法、检察等机关去担任负责工作，但这些部门不应该受党委领导。
    第四个问题，是怎样使共产党接受全国人民的监督。她说，政府受人民代表大会监督，但是党不受什么监督。她认为应该建立制度使人民监督共产党。
    李济深最后说，为了帮助共产党除“三害”，不要顾虑伤害不伤害党的问题，大家有话尽量说，这个会还要继续开。他同意周颖的意见，今后要把会上的发言归纳起来，提到中共中央统战部去。
