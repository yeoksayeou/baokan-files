　　Strive for a Greater Victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been exactly three years old today since they were first advocated by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma. In the past three years, with the development of the international situation, the Five Principles have gained increasingly universal recognition throughout the world. Why can the Five Principles penetrate people's hearts so quickly? This is because it most generally expresses the common demands and wishes of the people of all countries for peaceful coexistence. The Five Principles have become the basic准则 that must be observed in modern international relations.
    As one of the initiators of the Five Principles, our government has always strictly adhered to these principles and developed friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries on the basis of these principles. Our trade relations with Asian and African countries are developing healthily in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. For example, taking 1954 as 100, it increased to 118.52 in 1955, and further increased to 168.48 in 1956. In accordance with the spirit of the Five Principles, our country has resolved or is resolving certain problems left over from history with relevant countries. The people of our country, together with the people of India, Burma and other Asian and African countries, have been making great efforts to realize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, first proposed by Asian countries, were first widely responded to in the Asian and African regions. This is because the spirit of the Five Principles fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Asian and African people. The vast people of Asia and Africa have long suffered from colonial rule, and their most urgent demand now is to safeguard their national independence and carry out economic construction. Therefore, they unanimously demand that their territorial sovereignty should not be violated, their internal affairs should not be interfered with, and their culture and economy should be developed through equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. For the people of Asian and African countries, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are a powerful weapon to safeguard the national independence they have gained through long struggles. At the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the Five Principles were extended into the ten principles in the "Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation" unanimously adopted by the conference. This enables Asian and African countries to unite and fight against foreign aggression and interference, and to build their own countries.
    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have also been supported by the broad masses of people in Western Europe and other regions. Because for the people in these regions, in order to ease the tension caused by the American "Cold War", to get rid of the burden of the arms race, and to avoid a devastating nuclear weapons war, there is no other way out except peaceful coexistence.
    In the past three years, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, the unity and cooperation between Asian and African countries have greatly developed. This is not only reflected in the economic, trade, and cultural exchanges and cooperation between countries, but especially in the unity and cooperation they have shown in the struggle against colonialism. When Britain, France, and Israel launched an armed invasion of Egypt last year, the people of Asian and African countries, together with peace-loving people all over the world, condemned the aggressors in unison and supported the Egyptian people's anti-aggression struggle with practical actions. With the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the firm support of peace-loving people from all countries for Egypt, the imperialists' military adventure finally failed, and the forces advocating peaceful coexistence and opposing colonialism won a great victory.
    The British and French aggression against Egypt has failed shamefully. Whether they can learn from this the lesson of having to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence remains to be seen. Now, standing at the forefront of opposing peaceful coexistence is U.S. imperialism. It has neither learned much from the failures of its past wars of aggression against Korea and interference in Indochina, nor has it apparently learned any lessons from the disastrous aggression of Britain and France against Egypt. The United States is now trying its best to seize the colonies of Britain and France in the Middle East and North Africa. The notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine" is the most vicious attack on the people of the Middle East and North Africa in terms of military, political, and economic aspects. The United States blatantly interferes in the internal affairs of Jordan, carries out subversion in Egypt and Syria, and tries its best to provoke relations between Arab countries. The United States is also stepping up the creation of tension in the world, establishing atomic weapons bases, obstructing disarmament negotiations, and undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. All this shows that the United States does not want peaceful coexistence, and it fears peaceful coexistence as it fears the end of the world.
    However, the development of the international situation does not depend on a few imperialist adventurers, but on the vast masses of peace-loving people. There are more and more people advocating peaceful coexistence and supporting the Five Principles, and the forces of war and aggression are more isolated than ever before. The clear trend of the world is bound to move towards peaceful coexistence. The past year has been a year of great victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. On this basis, as long as all peace-loving people unite together, constantly expose and strike at the imperialists' conspiracies of war and aggression, we will be able to force the imperialist war forces to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence and push the cause of defending peace to a new victory.

### 争取和平共处原则的更大胜利

　　争取和平共处原则的更大胜利
    和平共处的五项原则，从中国和印度、缅甸三国总理开始倡导以来，到今天已经整整三年了。三年以来，随着国际局势的发展，五项原则在全世界获得日益普遍的承认。为什么五项原则能这样迅速地深入人心呢？这是因为它最概括地表达了各国人民对于和平共处的共同要求和愿望。五项原则已经成为现代国际关系中必须遵守的基本准则。
    作为五项原则的倡议者之一，我国政府始终严格地遵守这些原则，并以这些原则为基础，发展了和亚非国家的友好合作关系。我国和亚非国家之间的贸易关系，正在按照平等互利的原则健康地发展着，如以1954年为一百，1955年增加到一百一十八点五二，1956年又增加到一百六十八点四八。根据五项原则的精神，我国同有关国家解决了或者正在解决着历史上遗留下来的某些问题。我国人民同印度、缅甸和其他亚非国家人民在一起，为了实现和平共处的五项原则，一直在作着巨大的努力。
    由亚洲国家首先提出的和平共处的五项原则，首先在亚非地区得到广泛的响应，这是由于五项原则的精神完全符合亚非人民的根本利益。亚洲、非洲广大人民曾经长期遭受殖民主义的统治，他们现在最迫切的要求就是维护自己的民族独立和进行经济建设。因此，他们一致要求自己的领土主权不受侵犯，自己的内政不被干涉，并通过平等互利的合作来发展自己的文化和经济。对于亚非各国人民来说，和平共处的五项原则，是保障他们经过长期斗争得到的民族独立的一个有力的武器。在万隆亚非会议上，五项原则被引伸为会议最后一致通过的“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”中的十项原则。这就使得亚非国家能够团结起来，为反对外国的侵略和干涉、为建设自己的国家而斗争。
    和平共处的五项原则，同时也得到了西欧和其他地区广大人民的拥护和支持。因为对于这些地区的人民来说，要和缓美国的“冷战”所造成的紧张局势，要摆脱扩军备战所加在他们肩上的重担，要避免一场毁灭性的核子武器的战争，除了和平共处以外，没有任何别的出路。
    三年以来，在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的指导下，亚非国家之间的团结合作有了很大的发展。这不仅仅表现在各国之间在经济、贸易和文化上的交流和合作，尤其表现在它们在反对殖民主义的斗争中所表现的团结和合作。在去年英、法、以色列对埃及发动武装侵略的时候，亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，同声谴责侵略者，并以实际行动支援了埃及人民的反侵略斗争。在埃及人民的英勇抵抗和爱好和平的各国人民对埃及的坚决支持下，帝国主义者的军事冒险终于失败了，主张和平共处和反对殖民主义的力量取得了伟大的胜利。
    英、法对埃及的侵略已经可耻地失败了。它们是不是能从中得到必须遵守和平共处的五项原则的教训，还有待事实证明。现在，站在反对和平共处的最前列的是美帝国主义。它既没有从过去侵略朝鲜和干涉印度支那的战争的失败中学到多少东西，也显然没有从英、法对埃及倒霉的侵略中吸取任何教训。美国现在正在竭力夺取英、法在中东、北非的殖民地。臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，就是对中东和北非人民从军事、政治、经济等方面的最恶毒的进攻。美国公然干涉约旦的内政，在埃及、叙利亚进行颠复活动，千方百计地挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的关系。美国在世界范围内也正在加紧制造紧张局势，建立原子武器基地，阻挠裁军谈判，破坏朝鲜停战协定。这一切都说明美国不要和平共处，它像害怕世界末日一样地害怕和平共处。
    但是，国际局势的发展并不取决于少数帝国主义的冒险家，而取决于广大爱好和平的人民。主张和平共处，支持五项原则的人，是愈来愈多了，而战争和侵略势力是比以前任何时候都更加孤立了。世界潮流的明显趋势必然是走向和平共处。过去的一年，是和平共处的五项原则取得巨大胜利的一年。在这个基础上，只要一切爱好和平的人民团结在一起，不断地揭露和打击帝国主义的战争和侵略阴谋，我们就有可能迫使帝国主义战争势力接受和平共处的原则，把保卫和平的事业推向新的胜利。
