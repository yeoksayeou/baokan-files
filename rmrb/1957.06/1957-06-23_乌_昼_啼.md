　　Crow "Day" Cries

　　Crow and Phoenix Harmonize

Professor Ye Yuanlong, at the Shanghai Communist Party Propaganda Work Conference, raised the issue of "Phoenix Cries" and "Crow Cries." "Phoenix Cries" refer to "reporting good news," and "Crow Cries" refer to "reporting bad news." Mr. Ye advised Communist Party members: listen to the phoenix cries, and also listen to the crow cries; especially don't dislike the crow's caw, and fire a shot when it cries. Because if you fire a shot, the crow will certainly not be able to cry again, but even the phoenix will be too frightened to open its mouth!

I don't know from what year or month the crow became an "inauspicious" animal. I have not put in the effort to research this issue, so I cannot draw a conclusion. However, it can be confirmed: ① Crows are beneficial birds – the magpie, which "reports good news" to people, is actually a pest; ② The ancients believed that crows could "report good news" (see the explanation of "Crow Cries at Night" in "Essential Explanations of Ancient Yuefu Themes").

Most people think that the phoenix is a very beautiful bird, but that is not the case! It is: "Deer in front of a unicorn, snake's neck and fish's tail, dragon patterns and turtle's back, swallow's chin and chicken's beak, all five colors present" ("Shuowen"), really nothing to look at! What's more, there are fake phoenixes, quite a large number!

Therefore, the evaluation of phoenixes and crows should be viewed dialectically. It is best if crows and phoenixes can harmonize!

I imitate "Crow Cries at Night" to write "Crow Cries During the Day."

Whether to guard against the hunter's gun? Not within consideration!

　　Drizzle keeps falling
　　Gentle breeze and fine rain…

The contradictions among the people are not antagonistic contradictions, so when resolving contradictions among the people, there is no need for great fanfare, only a gentle breeze and fine rain are enough.

In principle, this is correct.

However, it also depends on the specific situation; one should not respond to all changes with the same unchanged method!

Drizzle that keeps falling is harmful: if it falls for too long, the seedlings will rot, and the cotton will not form bolls. When the field is initially wet, it is soft, but excessive water will make it hard. "During the Qingming Festival, it rains incessantly," and still: "travelers on the road are heartbroken"; unfortunately, if it rains continuously for half a year, many people will starve to death!

Gentle breezes and fine rains have their advantages, but the thunder and violent winds also have the power to sweep away haze! At certain times, when mistakes are serious and attitudes are stubborn: then thunder and violent winds are needed; in this case, gentle breezes and fine rains are not enough to quell public anger!

Especially not hoping for gentle breezes and fine rains for oneself, but thunder and violent winds for others; demanding self-criticism from non-Party members, but demanding that Party members criticize others!

I have heard many delegates reflect on the content, and some things are truly outrageous! Small democracy solves small deviations, big mistakes must be corrected by big democracy, just like prescribing the right medicine for the disease, some diseases should be treated with strong medicine.

　　Small Treatise with a Pit Smell

There is such a saying: old intellectuals lived in the old society for a long time, and inevitably have a "pit smell"!

The words are correct.

But one thing I don't quite understand: as far as I know, Communist Party members were not refined in the Eight Trigrams Furnace of the Supreme Lord Lao, they definitely came from the old society: then, on their bodies, isn't there even a trace of stink?

Someone said: "They joined the revolution long ago, whether 'underground' or 'above ground,' so the stink on their bodies has already been slapped off: this is called 'developmental perspective'!"

I replied: "I accept your teaching! Developmental perspective is the basic principle of the materialist conception of history. As far as I understand, 'development' includes 'vertical' development (development in time) and 'horizontal' development (development in space): neither is dispensable. The label of 'pit smell' is only put on the heads of old intellectuals, and almost in any movement, the 'evaluation' of intellectuals is out of context, without asking about development or connection, – or else only pursuing 'bad' connections – this has created a serious deviation: I develop, you don't develop! Thus, high walls are erected, alas!"

### 乌“昼”啼

专栏：什么话

　　乌“昼”啼
　　上海外国语学院教授　徐仲年
　　乌凤和鸣
    叶元龙教授在上海市共产党宣传工作会议上，提出了“凤鸣”与“乌鸣”的问题。“凤鸣”指的是“报喜”，“乌鸣”指的是“报忧”。叶先生劝共产党党员：凤鸣要听，乌鸣也要听；尤其不要因为不喜欢乌鸦叫，当乌鸣的时候，就一枪开去。因为一枪开去，乌鸦固然没法再鸣，可是连凤凰也吓得不敢开腔了！
    我不知道从何年何月起，乌鸦变成了“不吉利”的动物。我没有在这个问题上用过考证功夫，因此作不出结论。不过可以肯定：①乌鸦是益鸟，——向人“报喜”的喜鹊反而是害鸟；②古人以为乌鸦是能“报喜”的（可查：“乐府古题要解”中关于“乌夜啼”的解释）。
    一般人以为凤凰是很美丽的鸟，其实不然！它是：“麟前鹿后，蛇颈鱼尾，龙文龟背，燕颔鸡喙，五色备举”（“说文”），实在没有什么好看！何况还有假凤凰，为数相当的多！
    因此对于凤凰和乌鸦的估价，应当辩证地看。能够乌凤和鸣，那是最好的好事！
    我摹仿“乌夜啼”，作“乌昼啼”。
    是否提防猎人的枪？不在考虑之内！
    毛毛雨下个不停
    和风细雨……
    人民内部的矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾，因此解决人民内部矛盾的时候，用不到大张旗鼓，只须和风细雨就够了。
    在原则上，这是对的。
    然也要看具体情况，不该以不变应万变！
    毛毛雨下个不停是有害的：下得久了，秧要烂，棉不结铃。田初湿时是软的，容水过度就会变硬。“清明时节雨纷纷”，尚且要：“路上行人欲断魂”；不幸而霪雨一年半载，老百姓就得饿死不少！
    和风细雨自有他的妙处，但迅雷烈风也有扫荡阴霾之功！某些时候，错误严重，态度顽强：那就用得着迅雷烈风了；在这种情况下，和风细雨不足以息民愤！
    尤其不希望对己和风细雨，对人迅雷烈风；对党外人士要求自我批评，对党内人士则要求批评别人！
    我听了许多代表所反映的内容，有些事真令人发指！小民主解决小偏差，大错误就得用大民主来纠正，正如对症下药，有些病该用霸药来治。
    小论带坑臭
    有那么一种说法：旧知识分子在旧社会里生活得久了，难免有股“带坑臭”！
    话是对的。
    但是有一点，我不太明白：据我所知道，共产党党员不是从太上老君的八卦炉里炼出来的，确确实实也是从旧社会中来的：那么，在他们的身上，难道就没有一丝一毫的臭气么？
    有人说：“他们早就参加了革命，不论是‘地下’或‘地上’，因此他们身上的臭气早已拍掉了：这就叫做‘发展观点’！”
    我回答道：“承教了！发展观点是唯物史观的基本原则。据我所了解，所谓：‘发展’有‘纵’的发展（时间上的发展）和‘横’的发展（空间上的发展）：二者缺一就不行的。‘带坑臭’这顶帽子只望旧知识分子的头上戴，而且几乎在任何运动中，对于知识分子的‘评定’，都是断章取义，不问发展，不问联系，——要不然只追究‘坏的’联系，——这样就造成了：我发展，你不发展的严重偏差！于是高墙耸立起来了，呜呼！”
