A Nouveau Riche's Pleasure Grove, A Big Shot's Cozy Nest
    America in the Eyes of a British Reporter
    (Reported by this newspaper) The "New York Post" on May 16th published an abridged version of a dispatch from a British reporter, headlined: "Farewell to 'Brainless' America." The author of the dispatch is Rayner MacEl, a veteran "Daily Express" reporter stationed in Washington. He recently took a boat back to his country for vacation.
    MacEl said: He bid farewell to the United States with a feeling of "relief" and a joyful sense of having no nostalgia. He said that America is a place that is about to go crazy, a "huge, bustling ant colony of a country."
    It is "a cozy nest for the rich and big shots," "a country that makes 'young managers' complacent." The British reporter said that in America, "extra-large, conspicuous cars like the Taj Mahal. The endless stream of people dressed more and more strangely sometimes makes you feel like you are living in a costume party that never ends." "The cost of living and prices have long been rising wildly like missiles without guidance devices." "Cops who carelessly brandish guns and are fond of making trouble; all kinds of 'sedatives' are everywhere, and psychotherapy is all the rage across the country."
    MacEl said: Some new tricks made him dizzy, such as mink TV covers worth nine hundred and fifty dollars; he was shocked when he was charged twenty dollars for hiring a temporary maid to help arrange a small banquet; people lacked "common courtesy." He gave an example: "One night I asked a taxi driver to turn off his noisy radio. He said, 'Don't you want to take a ride, do you want to walk?'"
    MacEl wrote: "There is really everything here and in great variety, ... everything is new, remotely controlled, multi-purpose, extra-large and ridiculously extravagant."

　　暴发户的快活林  大阔老的安乐窝
    英国记者眼里的美国
    本报讯  “纽约邮报”在5月16日摘要转载了一个英国记者的通讯，标题是：“向‘无头脑’的美国告别”。通讯的作者是“每日快报”驻华盛顿的老资格记者雷纳·麦克尔。他最近坐船回国休假。
    麦克尔说：他以“如释重负”和毫无留恋的痛快心情向美国告别。他说美国是个快要发神经病的地方，是一个“巨大的、熙攘如蚁群的国家”。
    它是“有钱人和大阔老的安乐窝”，“一个使‘年青的经理’洋洋得意的国家”。这位英国记者说，在美国，“特大号的像泰吉·玛哈尔陵那样惹人注目的汽车。穿著越来越奇特的络绎不绝的人群，使人有时觉得仿佛生活在一个永远不散的化装晚会之中。”“生活费用和物价早就像无导向装置的飞弹一样乱涨。”“漫不经心地舞弄手枪的爱寻事的警察；五花八门的‘镇静’药片到处都是，精神治疗风靡全国。”
    麦克尔说：有些新花样搞得他发昏，例如价值九百五十美元的貂皮的电视机套子；请一个临时女佣帮忙安排一个小小的宴会索价二十美元把他吓了一跳；人们缺乏“一般的礼貌”。他举例说：“有一天晚上我请一位出租汽车司机关上他的吵得要命的无线电。他说‘你不要坐车，要走路吗？’”
    麦克尔写道：“这里真是应有尽有而且种类繁多，……什么都是新式的、远距离操纵的、多种用途的、特大号的和荒乎其唐的。”
