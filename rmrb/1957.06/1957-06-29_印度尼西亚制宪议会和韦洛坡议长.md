　　Indonesian Constituent Assembly and Speaker Wilopo

　　The Indonesian Constituent Assembly is a special body elected by the people and attended by various parties. The nature and tasks of the Constituent Assembly are different from those of the parliament. Its main task is to formulate the Indonesian Constitution and to elect the president and vice president. After these two tasks are completed, the Constituent Assembly will be dissolved.

　　At present, Indonesia's constitution has not yet been formulated, and the provisional constitution promulgated in August 1950 is being implemented. The current president and vice president were also elected by the then provisional parliament in accordance with this constitution.

　　The election of the Constituent Assembly began on December 15, 1955, and ended throughout the country in July last year. According to the provisions of the Indonesian Provisional Constitution, the total number of seats in the Constituent Assembly is 520 (one representative is elected for every 150,000 people). As a result of this election, apart from reserving six seats for representatives from West Irian, a total of 514 members of the Constituent Assembly were elected from 34 parties. Among them, the Indonesian Nationalist Party won the most seats, with 119 seats; the Communist Party occupied 80 seats, ranking fourth.

　　On November 10, 1956, the Indonesian Constituent Assembly was officially established. Dr. Wilopo, one of the leaders of the Nationalist Party, was elected as the speaker of this assembly. People from five other political parties, including Sakirman, chairman of the Communist Party parliamentary group, were elected as the first to fifth deputy speakers respectively. On February 14 this year, at the 35th meeting of the Constituent Assembly, a preparatory committee of 177 people was established to draft the constitution. Up to the beginning of this month, the Constituent Assembly has held two debates on the basic content of the new Indonesian constitution. During the debate, the basic principles of the new constitution have not been determined until now because of opposition from right-wing elements on some major issues related to guaranteeing Indonesia's national independence and unity and opposing foreign aggressive forces in the national system.

　　According to regulations, at least two-thirds of the members of the Constituent Assembly should attend the meeting before voting on the draft of the new constitution can be carried out. The new constitution must be approved by two-thirds of the members present at the meeting before it can be passed, and then approved by the government before it can be implemented. Members of the Constituent Assembly do not have a fixed term of office, nor are they re-elected.

　　Dr. Wilopo, the speaker of the Constituent Assembly, is the one who was invited to visit our country this time. He once served as the Prime Minister of Indonesia, and also served as the Minister of Labor and Economic Affairs. In the first general election in Indonesia, which began in September 1955, he was elected as a member of parliament. In April last year, he was elected as the chairman of the Second Committee (Finance Committee) of the Parliament, and in November he was elected to his current position. Speaker Wilopo was originally one of the founders of the "Indonesian People's Action Party", then joined the Nationalist Party and was elected as the second chairman of the Nationalist Party in July last year. This well-known figure in Indonesian politics was born in Purworejo, Java in 1909 and is now forty-eight years old. He graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology and Jakarta Law School, and obtained a doctorate in law. (Chang Gong)

　　印度尼西亚制宪议会和韦洛坡议长
    印度尼西亚制宪议会，是一个由人民选举产生、有各党派参加的专门机构。制宪议会的性质和任务和国会不同，它的主要任务是制定印度尼西亚宪法，并且负责选出总统和副总统。这两项任务完成后，制宪议会即行解散。
    目前，印度尼西亚的宪法尚未制定，实行的是1950年8月颁布的临时宪法，现任总统和副总统也是根据这部宪法由当时的临时国会选出的。
    制宪议会的选举，是从1955年12月15日开始，直到去年7月才在全国范围内结束的。根据印度尼西亚临时宪法的规定，制宪议会全部席位为五百二十名（每十五万人选举一名）。这次选举的结果，除了给西伊里安代表保留六席外，在三十四个党派中共选出了五百一十四名制宪议会议员。其中印度尼西亚国民党获得席位最多，有一百一十九席；共产党占八十席，居第四位。
    1956年11月10日，印度尼西亚制宪议会正式成立。国民党领袖之一韦洛坡博士当选为这个议会的议长，包括共产党国会党团主席萨基尔曼在内的其它五个政党人士，分别被选为第一到第五副议长。今年2月14日，在制宪议会举行的第三十五次会议上，成立了一个由一百七十七人组成的筹备委员会，起草宪法。到本月初为止，制宪议会对印度尼西亚新宪法的基本内容，已经进行了两次的辩论。辩论中，由于在一些有关保证印度尼西亚国家的独立统一，和反对外国侵略势力的国家体制等重大问题上，遭到了右派分子的反对，因而新宪法的基本原则一直到现在还没能确定下来。
    根据规定，制宪议会议员最少应有三分之二出席会议，对新宪法草案始能进行表决。新宪法要有出席会议的三分之二议员赞成才能表决通过，然后由政府批准才能实施生效。制宪议会议员没有固定任期，也不进行改选。
    这次应邀来我国访问的韦洛坡博士，就是制宪议会的议长。他曾任印度尼西亚总理，并做过劳工、经济事务两部的部长。在1955年9月开始举行的印度尼西亚第一次普选中，他被选为国会议员。去年4月，他被选为国会第二小组（财政小组）的主席，11月被选任现职。韦洛坡议长最早曾经是“印度尼西亚人民行动党”的创始人之一，后来加入国民党并且在去年7月被选为国民党的第二主席。这位印度尼西亚政界中的知名人士，于1909年出生在爪哇的布禾勒约，现年四十八岁。他在万隆工科大学和雅加达法学院毕业，并获得法学博士学位。        （长弓）
