    Translation and Publication
    Ru Long
    I am a translator. I would like to talk about my views on publishing issues from the perspective of literary translation.

    Since liberation, the types of translated publications have increased, the number of copies printed has increased, and the overall quality of translations has also improved. We are delighted with these great achievements. Although publishing work in this area cannot yet meet current needs, we believe that as long as we continue to work hard on this basis, we can further promote the prosperity of the translation industry.

    The question is how to promote this further prosperity.

    I think there is a fundamental question worth raising for discussion, and that is whether there are too few current literary publishing houses? Should more be established?

    Currently, there are only two purely literary publishing houses in the country: People's Literature Publishing House and New Literature Publishing House. In addition, there are publishing houses that can only be considered half, such as China Youth Publishing House and China Children's Publishing House. But for translators, there is actually only one publishing house, because publishing houses have divided the labor on translation plans to avoid duplication.

    Having few publishing houses has many disadvantages.

    Taking translation alone, readers currently complain that many world-famous works, both ancient and modern, have not been translated, and they demand more and faster publication, even complete selections or complete works. For good books that have already been published, they demand that they not be out of print indefinitely. This requires formulating plans and mobilizing all translation forces. It cannot be said that publishing houses have not made efforts; they formulate plans and find translators. But the plans are so large, and there are so many veteran and new translators, how can they manage it all? How can they do it thoroughly? For example, how can an editorial department carefully process tens of millions of words of submissions each month? This means that it cannot bear this burden. This is the predicament of the publishing house. This is one side. On the other hand, since it is a monopoly, it doesn't matter if it takes on less of this burden. Therefore, it is only enthusiastic about completing current affairs, and can only show limited concern for tapping potential and books being out of print. From the reader's point of view, this kind of publishing house seems old and a bit senile.

    Secondly, readers also demand that the quality of translations continue to improve. Over the years, after opposing shoddy and rushed translations, they now further demand that literary works not only be translated to be similar in appearance, but also to convey the spirit. They are not satisfied with translating rich and colorful works of art into dry and mediocre ones. This is first and foremost the translator's responsibility: they must improve their literary cultivation, enrich their knowledge of life, and conduct in-depth research on the original work. Publishing houses also have a responsibility: to encourage various schools of translation with different but distinctive techniques, to support re-translations that express the original style with different techniques, to organize works on foreign literature research, and to edit journals on foreign literature research. To be fair, publishing houses have contributed to correcting shoddy and rushed translations in the past. But now, improving quality includes such complex work, and publishing houses are already too busy, so how can they add to this burden? It cannot bear it. On the other hand, it is natural for only one school to prevail in an editorial department. What a monopoly can often produce is the idea of ​​a "definitive edition," making it difficult to achieve a hundred flowers blooming. As for research articles, it is even more troublesome to review, so some translators even have their requests to write a preface before the book rejected.

    Furthermore, publishing houses and translators were originally in the same boat, and their relationship should be very close. But this is not the case. Currently, there generally exists a relationship of superficial harmony but actual indifference between the two sides, not like a family. A monopoly often cares first about whether this book or that book can complete the task, so even if it is unintentional, it cannot help but reveal the airs of a buyer when selecting and using translators. In order not to miss the only publishing opportunity, translators have to "get along well," and as one translator put it, they become "afraid to insist on their opinions to the publishing house." This kind of estrangement becomes tense when problems arise and goes to extremes. For example, I heard of such a thing: a manuscript by an accomplished veteran translator was heavily revised by the publishing house because the translation style did not conform to the popular word-for-word translation method. Several rounds of written arguments were exchanged, and finally they broke up unhappily. The two sides have had no contact since then, which means the opportunity to publish the book is gone. The atmosphere created by this kind of thing affects more than just that translator. Other translators will also become hesitant, and when they are translating with gusto, they will look around nervously. I personally have this feeling. It is heartbreaking to talk about such things!

    If my analysis above is correct, although the publishing house itself cannot shirk its responsibility for all these problems, the fundamental reason is that there are too few literary publishing houses, and a monopoly is bound to cause adverse consequences.

    If more literary publishing houses were established, under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, and both being state-owned publishing enterprises, engaging in friendly competition on the common basis of engaging in socialist cultural construction, then these shortcomings could be completely or greatly overcome.

    Still taking translation as an example. This does not affect the plan, and there is still a division of labor between publishing houses, but this is a flexible division of labor, not a rigid one.

    Since there is competition, publishing houses will inevitably try their best to publish books quickly, in large quantities, and of good quality. They will not allow good books to be out of print for too long. Because this will affect its competitive future.

    If these publishing houses each have their own characteristics and schools, then they will not regard uniting like-minded veteran translators as an urgent task, nor will they regard cultivating new forces as a burden. They must each have a strong lineup.

    Competition promotes the production of various schools, and the improvement of quality will become colorful and brilliant.

    Publishing houses will definitely rely on translators, and translators will also regard themselves as the masters of the publishing house. The relationship will be normal.

    Then, the festival of translation prosperity is not far away! (Speech at a symposium)

    翻译和出版
    汝龙
    我是一个翻译工作者。我想从文学翻译事业这个角度来谈谈我对出版问题的看法。
    解放以后出版的翻译出版物，种类比以前多，印数比以前大，一般译文质量也比以前提高了，这种巨大的成绩使我们高兴。虽然这方面的出版工作还不能满足当前的需要，但是我们相信只要在这个基础上继续努力，就可以使翻译事业进一步繁荣起来。
    问题在于怎样做才能推动这种进一步的繁荣。
    我以为有一个根本问题值得提出来商量，那就是目前的文艺出版社是不是少了一点？是不是该多办几个？
    现在纯粹的文艺出版社全国只有两个：人民文学出版社和新文艺出版社。此外还有只能算半个的出版社，如青年出版社、少年儿童出版社等。而对翻译工作者说来，实际上只有一个出版社，因为各出版社为了避免重复，在翻译计划上分了工。
    出版社少，有种种的不利。
    单以翻译事业来说。当前，读者们嫌世界各国古今名著还有很多没译过来，要求多出，快出，甚至要求出完整的选集或全集。对已出的好书，要求不要无尽期的脱销。这就需要编订计划，调动全部翻译力量。不能说出版社没出力，他们订计划，找翻译家。可是计划那么大，老一辈和新一辈的翻译工作者那么多，他们怎么忙得过来？怎么能做得周到？例如一个编辑部每月收到上千万字的投稿，怎能仔细处理？这是说，它担不起这个担子。这是出版社的苦衷。这是一面。另一方面，反正独家经营，这个担子少担一点也没关系。于是只热心于完成当前的事务，对挖掘潜力，书的脱销等等只能表现有限度的关心。从读者眼里看来，这种出版社就显得老大，带点暮气了。
    其次，读者还要求译文质量不断提高。历年来，在反对粗制滥造、抢译滥译以后，他们现在进一步要求：文学作品不仅要译得貌似，还要译得传神，他们不满意把丰富多彩的艺术品译得干枯平庸。这首先是译者的责任：他得提高文学修养，丰富生活知识，对原作进行深入研究。出版社也有责任：鼓励各种翻译手法不同而各有特色的流派，支持用不同手法表现原作风格的重复译本，组织外国文学研究的著作，编辑外国文学研究的刊物。平心而论，以往在纠正粗制滥造、抢译滥译中出版社是做出贡献的。可是现在改进质量却包括这么复杂的工作，出版社本来就忙不过来，怎能再添这负担？它担不起。另一方面，在一个编辑部里只能有一种流派占上风，这是很自然的。独家经营所能产生的往往是“定本”思想，很难作到百花齐放。至于研究性的文章，审查起来更是麻烦，因此有的译者要求在书前写一篇序都会遭到拒绝了。
    再其次，出版社和译者原是坐一条船，相互关系应该十分亲密。但是事实不然。目前双方一般地存在着一种表面一团和气、实际上冷淡的关系，不像一家人。独家经营首先关心的往往是这本书那本书的能否完成任务，因此他在挑选和使用译者的时候即使无心，也不能不多少流露出买主的派头。译者为了使译品不错过唯一的出版机会，就不能不“搞好关系”，结果，照某一位翻译家的话来说，就变成“对于出版社有意见也不敢坚持。”这种隔阂遇到出了问题，就会变得紧张，各走极端。例如听说有这样一件事：一位有成就的老翻译家的一部稿子，因为译笔不符合那种字扣字的流行译法，被出版社改了很多，往还打了几次笔墨官司，终于不欢而散，双方从此没有联系，就是说出书的机会没有了。在这类事情造成的空气下，影响到的还不止于是那位译者。别的译者也会变得缩手缩脚，下笔译书一到酣畅的时候就会左顾右盼。我个人就有这种感觉。这类事说起来是使人痛心的！
    如果我上面的分析是正确的话，所有这些问题，追究起原因来，虽然出版社本身不能辞其咎，但是根本的原因还在于文艺出版社太少，独家经营势必造成不良后果。
    如果文艺出版社多办几个，同在文化部领导下，同是国营出版事业，在从事社会主义文化建设事业的共同基础上展开友谊的竞赛，那么这些缺点就可以完全或者大大地克服了。
    仍旧以翻译来说。这并不影响计划，各出版社之间仍然有分工，不过这是灵活的、而不是呆板的分工。
    既然竞赛，各出版社势必尽量做到书要出得快、多、好。好的书籍脱销过久，它们不会允许。因为这会影响它的竞赛前途。
    如果这些出版社各有各的特色和流派，那它们就不会把团结志同道合的老译者看做不急之务，也不会把培养新生力量看做负担。它们必须各有坚强的阵容。
    竞赛促使各种流派生产，质量的提高会变得绚烂多彩。
    出版社一定会依靠译者，译者也会把自己看成出版社的主人翁。关系就正常了。
    那么，翻译繁荣的节日就不远了！　（在一个座谈会上的发言）
