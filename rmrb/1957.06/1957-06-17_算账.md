　　Settling Accounts
　　Ren Hui
    Chen Renbing advocates settling old scores, demanding that a few people be singled out for "effective" handling, otherwise it would not be enough to appease public anger, etc. In response, the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" has already written an editorial refuting this. The editorial concludes by asking readers to judge whether "this is a new account or an old account."
    In my judgment, what Chen Renbing wants to settle is obviously a "new account," that is, accounts since liberation; more precisely, only the Communist Party's accounts, not his own. As for the old accounts before liberation, he doesn't want to settle them, and I don't think these gentlemen are willing to settle them either. Because, if we seriously calculate that account, the rightists' ledgers don't seem very glorious.
    Settling "new accounts," that is, accounts since liberation, the Communist Party can say with great confidence that they cannot be overthrown by such accounting. No matter how you calculate it, the result will still be that formula that Chen Renbing dislikes the most: "Achievements are primary, shortcomings and errors are secondary." This rectification movement is indeed a process where the Communist Party is also keeping accounts and settling accounts with itself. Because it cannot be overthrown, it has the confidence to lay out the accounts for everyone to calculate together. The Communist Party has never meant to deny its debts; this has long been confirmed by historical facts.
    Chen Renbing and other rightists only want to settle new accounts without mentioning their own old accounts. I think this is quite a bit like denying their debts. Because, as I said before, the rightists' old accounts are not very glorious when calculated. Mr. Chen Renbing is in Shanghai. Let's take the rightists in Shanghai as an example. That rash gentleman (his official title is Lu Juewu) who provoked many people's opposition with his speech at the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference owes a great debt to us, the group of literary and art workers and drama workers who lived in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. He was the Kuomintang's "Censor Official" at that time. Under his vermilion pen, how many plays and books were banned? How should this account be settled?
    On this point, the Communist Party is indeed sincerely tolerant, not regarding these people as enemies, and adopting a policy of not blaming past misdeeds. Today, if we want to settle these old accounts, then we can not only "single out a few people," but also single out a group—or even a large group of people. If we want to deal with this group of people, and deal with them "effectively," then I think people will say we "lack magnanimity."
    The "Liberation Daily" editorial stated our consistent position: "Even towards enemies, including armed enemies, as long as they lay down their weapons, we still advocate not settling old scores and implementing a lenient policy..." We have done this in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future. However, what if temporarily laying down weapons is a false surrender, and they pick up their weapons again to attack the Party and challenge the people at the first opportunity? Then, according to Chen Renbing's "effective" handling method, how should such people be dealt with?

    陈仁炳主张算旧账，要求挑几个人出来“有效的”处理一下，否则不足以平民愤云云。对此，上海“解放日报”已经写了一篇社论来反驳。这篇社论的结尾，请读者来判断一下，“这是一笔新账，还是旧账”。
    据我判断，陈仁炳要算的显然是“新账”，即解放以来的账；更明白的，是只算共产党的账，不算他自己的账。至于解放以前的旧账呢，他不想算，我看这些先生们也不愿算。因为，假如认认真真地算起那笔账来，右派分子的账面上似乎并不是很光彩的。
    算“新账”，即解放以来的账，共产党可以很有信心地说，算不倒。不论怎样算，算来算去还是陈仁炳所最不喜欢的那个公式：“成绩是主要的，缺点、错误是次要的。”这次整风，共产党的确对自己也在记账、算账。因为算不倒，所以有信心，把账目摊出来，大家一起算。共产党从来就没有赖账的意思，这是早已为历史事实所证实了。
    陈仁炳等右派分子只要算新账而不提他们自己的旧账，我倒以为颇有一点赖账的嫌疑。因为，正如我前面说过，右派分子的旧账，算起来实在并不光彩。陈仁炳先生在上海，就拿上海的右派分子做一个例吧，在上海市政协发言引起了许多人反对的那位鲁莽先生（他的官名是鲁觉吾），就对我们这批抗战时期住在重庆的文艺工作者、戏剧工作者欠下一笔很大的债，他是当时国民党的“审查老爷”，在他的朱笔之下，不知禁过多少戏，多少书，这笔账，怎样算呢？
    在这一点上，共产党的确是存心忠厚，不把这些人看作仇人，采取了既往不咎的态度。今天，假如要算这些旧账，那么我们不仅可以“挑出几个人”来，而且可以挑出一批——乃至一大批人来，假如对这批人要处理、而且要“有效的”处理一下，那么我想，人家又会说我们“缺乏雅量”了。
    “解放日报”社论说出了我们历来的主张：“就是对敌人，包括武装的敌人，只要他放下武器，我们仍然主张不算旧账，实行宽大政策……”。我们过去这样做，今后也还是这样做。但是，假如一时的放下武器是假投降，一有机会又重新拿起武器来向党进攻，向人民挑战呢？那么，对于这种人，照陈仁炳的“有效的”处理办法，究竟应该如何处理才好呢？
