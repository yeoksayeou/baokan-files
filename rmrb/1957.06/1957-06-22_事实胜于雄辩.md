　　Facts Speak Louder Than Words
　　Chang Xiangyu
　　Since the Communist Party launched the rectification campaign, I have seen several anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks in the newspapers. I feel very indignant and激愤. Although I am a non-Party actor, I also have some opinions on the Party's bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. However, I completely disagree with those remarks that deviate from the Party's leadership, deviate from the socialist path, and violate the will of the people. I firmly oppose their opinions. It should be affirmed that the leadership of the Communist Party is wise and correct, and the achievements are unprecedented; at the same time, due to the rapid development of various constructions in a country with 600 million people, shortcomings are inevitable. The Party wants to carry out rectification and ask everyone to help with suggestions, which shows the greatness of the proletarian party. This makes the people even happier and love it even more. Because the people know that the Communist Party has decided to carry out rectification for the greater happiness of the people. Through past facts, the people know that the stronger the leadership of the Party, the better, and the greater and more guaranteed the people's happiness will be.
　　There is an old Chinese saying: "Facts speak louder than words." To distinguish between good and bad, whether it is people or things, one must look at the facts. The people overthrew Chiang Kai-shek in the past because he betrayed the country and harmed the people. Even today, when Americans have killed Chinese people in Taiwan for no reason, he still says that the people are wrong and smiles to apologize to the Americans.
　　Now the people say in unison that the Communist Party leads well and shout "Long live the Communist Party." This is not an empty slogan, but the heartfelt words expressed through the eyes of the people and through the people's personal feelings. The completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway allows the people to know that it was the Communist Party that led them to realize their forty-year wish. The Yangtze River Bridge has been completed, and the people are well aware that it was the Communist Party that brought convenience to the people on both sides of the Yangtze River. The Sanmenxia Reservoir has started construction, and the people know that it is the Communist Party that is eliminating disasters and difficulties for compatriots on both sides of the Yellow River who have suffered almost every year. The facts are everywhere and obvious to all. I think those who publish fallacies against the Communist Party and against socialism are in great need of rectifying their own reactionary thoughts first, because they do not understand the people's thoughts and feelings in the first place. Ge Peiqi said: The masses want to overthrow the Communist Party and kill the Communists. As I see it, if it weren't for the Communist Party protecting him, he would be beaten by the farmers' carrying poles and the workers' shovels. Chu Anping said that today is "the Party's world" and also said that "the bad relationship between the Party and the masses is a nationwide phenomenon." I oppose this kind of fallacy. There are people outside the Party who hold leadership positions in various departments everywhere. I myself am the President of the Henan Yuju Opera Academy. The so-called "nationwide phenomenon" is not a fact, but a distortion of the truth and an attempt to sow discord. If you disregard the facts and insist that it is the Communist Party's world alone, the people will criticize you, because the people know that this is the world of 600 million people! Liu Jixue, the Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, said: In the old society, the countryside was "the poor benefiting from the rich, and the rich benefiting from heaven." This view is even more absurd. I think he was probably born into a wealthy family; otherwise, he would never stand on the landlord's position, speak for the landlords, and slander the working people. He has forgotten how many farmers starved to death in Henan in the old society. As far as I know, around 1940, tens of thousands of people fled to Xi'an and other places to beg for food to survive. Take my own experience as an example. In the old society, I was hit by a grenade from the reactionaries, forced to swallow gold, and drink kerosene. When performing for the big officials, I was not even allowed to enter through the front door. Is this what you call "the poor benefiting from the rich"? But today, in the People's Congresses, the CPPCC, and the people's organizations at all levels, there are our artists participating. Now no one dares to say that opera singers are "inferior," and like many artists, I have also become a representative of the people and a member of the government. You should know that this is not only true for artists; many workers' and farmers' representatives, like me, have also strode into Huai Ren Tang and sat there discussing national affairs.
　　Through the past and present realities of life, the people have gained a very deep understanding of a truth, that is, only the Communist Party can lead them to truly gain freedom and enjoy happiness, so the people love and support it. Perhaps those who publish anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks are somewhat dissatisfied with this, but I would like to remind you: You should know that behind your absurd remarks, there are 600 million people who are dissatisfied!
　　Finally, I want to repeat once again, "Facts speak louder than words." The people understand this truth the most. I suggest that those who publish reactionary remarks wake up from their bourgeois dreams!

　　事实胜于雄辩
　　常香玉
    自从共产党开展整风以来，在报纸上我看到了几篇反党，反社会主义的言论，我很不平也很激愤。我虽是一个无党无派的演员，对党的官僚主义，宗派主义和主观主义也有一些意见。但是我却完全不同意那些脱离党的领导，脱离社会主义道路的违背人民意志的言论，我坚决反对他们的意见。应该肯定共产党的领导是英明而又正确的，成绩是亘古无双的；同时由于各项建设在六亿人民的大国中迅速发展，缺点也是难免的。党要整风，要大家帮助提意见，这正说明了无产阶级政党的伟大。这使人民更高兴，更爱它。因为人民知道共产党是为了人民更大的幸福而决定整风的。通过以往的事实，人民知道，党的领导越强越好，人民的幸福就越来越大越有保障。
    中国有句古话说：“事实胜于雄辩”。不论对人对事，要辨别它的好坏，就是要看事实，人民过去打倒蒋介石就是因为他卖国，他害苦人民，直到今天，美国人无故打死在台湾的中国人，他还说老百姓不对，笑着向美国人赔情。
    现在人民异口同声说共产党领导的好，喊共产党万岁，这不是一个空洞的口号，这是通过人民的眼睛，通过人民亲身的感受，所表达的肺腑之言。成渝铁路通车了，人民知道，是共产党领导他们实现了四十年来的愿望。长江大桥合龙了，人民都清楚，是共产党为大江南北的人民带来了便利。三门峡水库开工了，人民知道是共产党为黄河两岸几乎年年受害的同胞消灾除难。事实是处处皆是，有目共睹的，我想那些发表反对共产党，反对社会主义谬论的人，倒是很需要先整整自己的反动思想，因为他们首先就不了解人民的心事和人民的感情。葛佩琦说：群众要推翻共产党，要杀共产党人。叫我看要不是共产党保护他，他就要挨农民的扁担，挨工人的铁锨的。储安平说今天是“党天下”，又说“党群关系的不好，是一个全国性的现象”。这种谬论我就反对，党外人士担任各部门领导工作的那里都有，我就担任着河南豫剧院的正院长。所谓“全国性的现象”并非事实，而是颠倒黑白，播弄是非。如果你自己不顾事实，硬说是共产党一家的天下，人民就会批驳你，因为人民知道这是六万万人民的天下啊！民革河南省委的副主任委员刘积学说：在旧社会农村中是“贫沾富光，富沾天光”，这种观点更属荒谬。我想他大概是富户人家出身，不然的话他决不会站在地主的立场上，替地主说话来诬蔑劳动人民，他忘记了在旧社会在河南饿死过多少农民。仅我所知，在1940年前后，逃荒到西安等地去要饭活命的人就数以万计。就拿我自己的经历来说吧，在旧社会我挨过反动派的手榴弹，逼的我吞过金子，喝过煤油。给大官们演堂会连大门都不让走，这就叫“穷占富光”吗？可是今天在各级人民代表大会，政协，和人民团体中，就都有我们艺人参加。现在再没人敢说唱戏的“下贱”了，并且我也和许多艺人一样作了人民的代表和政府委员了；要知道这并不是光艺人是如此，许多工人和农民的代表，他们也和我同样的昂首阔步走进了怀仁堂，坐在那里议论着国家大事。
    人民通过了以往和今天的现实生活，使他们极为深刻的懂得了一条真理，那就是只有共产党才能以领导他们真正得到自由，享到幸福，所以人民爱戴它，拥护它。也许那些发表反党，反社会主义言论的人，正是为此有些不服，但是我愿意提醒你们：要知道在你们荒谬言论的后边，还有六万万人不服呢！
    最后我要再重复一遍，“事实胜于雄辩”，人民是最懂得这个道理的，我建议那些发表反动言论的人们，从资产阶级的美梦中清醒一下吧！
