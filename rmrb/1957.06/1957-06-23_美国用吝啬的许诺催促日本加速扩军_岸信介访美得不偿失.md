Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 22nd: U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in their joint statement issued last night, emphasized that "free nations should continue to maintain their strength and unity" and that "its defensive capabilities must be maintained until armaments are effectively supervised."

As can be seen from the communique, the United States' approach is to make limited promises regarding some of Japan's strong demands, thereby strengthening its control over Japan and urging Japan to accelerate its rearmament.

The communique stated that "the United States welcomes Japan's plans to strengthen its defense capabilities." Therefore, "the United States will, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Security Treaty, significantly reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan within the next year, including the rapid withdrawal of all U.S. ground combat forces." Furthermore, "the United States also intends to make further reductions as Japan's defense capabilities are strengthened." According to the Japanese military expansion plan brought by Nobusuke Kishi to Washington this time, Japan will increase its army to 180,000, its naval vessels to 124,000 tons, and its air force to 1,300 aircraft over the three years starting next year.

At the same time, the United States and Japan have reached an agreement to establish an intergovernmental committee to study issues arising from the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and "future adjustments of those aspects of the relationship between the United States and Japan that can meet the needs and desires of the people of both countries."

Before Nobusuke Kishi went abroad, the Japanese public had demanded that he strive to abolish the unequal U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the ensuing "Administrative Agreement."

The communique believes that the relationship between Japan and the United States "is entering a new period firmly based on common interests and trust." The communique states that the relationship between the United States and Japan is based on "a solid foundation" of "sovereign equality, mutual benefit, and mutually beneficial cooperation." However, even as the communique talked about dealing with issues such as territory and trade, it ignored such a foundation.

On the issue of the Ryukyu Islands, Eisenhower pointed out that the United States believes that "it is necessary to maintain the status quo," and the United States can only recognize that Japan holds "residual sovereignty" over these islands.

Regarding the embargo restrictions that Japan urgently requested to be lifted, Eisenhower emphasized the need to continue to control the export of "strategic materials" during the talks. Although Nobusuke Kishi pointed out the need for Japan to increase trade, he agreed that it was necessary to "implement such controls in cooperation with other free world governments." At the same time, Eisenhower did not give a definite answer to Japan's hope that the United States would lift some restrictions on the sale of Japanese goods, only vaguely stating that "unnecessary and arbitrary restrictions" would not be imposed.

Nobusuke Kishi had high hopes for the United States' support for his "Asian Development Fund plan." However, during the talks, the United States only indicated that it would "study" the plan.

The communique stated that the two countries fully agreed that an effective international agreement on reducing nuclear and conventional armaments is of decisive importance to the future of the world. However, the United States did not explicitly express acceptance of the demand to stop the testing and manufacturing of nuclear weapons. Eisenhower only told Nobusuke Kishi that the United States was taking Kishi's views into consideration when formulating the United States' attitude at the current London United Nations Disarmament Conference.

### 美国用吝啬的许诺催促日本加速扩军  岸信介访美得不偿失

　　美国用吝啬的许诺催促日本加速扩军
    岸信介访美得不偿失
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和日本首相岸信介昨天晚上发表的会谈公报强调说，“自由国家应当继续保持它们的力量和团结”，并且“在军备得到有效监督之前必须维持它的防御能力”。
    从公报中可以看出，美国的做法是：对日本的强烈要求的一部分作出有限的许诺，进而加强对日本的控制和催促日本加快重整军备。
    公报说，“美国欢迎日本关于加强它的防御力量的计划”。因此，“美国将按照安全条约的字句和精神，在明年以内大大减少驻日本的美国军队的人数，包括迅速撤退所有的美国地面战斗部队”。并且，“美国还打算随着日本防御力量的加强作进一步的裁减”。按照这次岸信介带到华盛顿去的日本扩军计划，日本将在从明年度起的三年中把陆军增加到十八万人，海军舰只增加到十二万四千吨，空军增加到拥有飞机一千三百架。
    同时，美日双方已经取得协议，成立一个政府之间的委员会，来研究在美日安全条约方面发生的问题和“美国和日本之间的关系中的能够满足两国人民的需要和愿望的这些方面的将来调整”。
    在岸信介出国前，日本公众曾经要求他努力废除不平等的美日安全条约和随之而来的“行政协定”。
    公报认为，日本和美国的关系“正在进入一个以共同利益和信赖为坚实基础的新时期”。公报说，美国和日本的关系所依据的是“主权平等、互利和对两国有利的合作”这样一个“牢固的基础”。但是，就在公报中谈到处理领土、贸易等问题的时候，却忽视了这样的基础。
    在琉球群岛问题上，艾森豪威尔指出，美国认为，“有必要继续保持现状”，美国只能承认，日本对这些岛屿握有“残存的主权”。
    对于日本迫切要求撤销的禁运限制，艾森豪威尔在会谈中强调了继续管制“战略物资”出口的必要。岸信介虽然指出了日本增加贸易的必要，但是他同意有必要“在与其他自由世界政府合作之下实行这种管制”。同时，对于日本所希望的美国取消对出售日本商品的一些限制，艾森豪威尔也没有作肯定的答复，只是笼统地表示“不施加不必要的和任意的限制”。
    岸信介曾经对美国支持他的“亚洲开发基金计划”，抱有很大的希望。但是，在会谈中美国只表示将“研究”这个计划。
    公报说，两国完全同意，削减原子核军备和常规军备的有效国际协定对世界的未来具有决定性的重要意义。但是，美国并没有明确表示接受停止试验和制造核武器的要求。艾森豪威尔只是对岸信介说，在制定美国在目前的伦敦联合国裁军会议上的态度方面，美国正在考虑到岸信介的意见。
