Xinhua News Agency, Akhtuba, 24th (TASS): The Friendship Railway is extending from Akhtuba towards the grasslands of the Soviet and Chinese border. Surveying mechanics are at the forefront, followed by track-laying machines and construction workers building housing and productive buildings.

Currently, all personnel are engaged in a competition to increase the speed of work and greet the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution with practical achievements.

The staff of the 137th Construction and Installation Train received an important task: laying tracks.

　　把中苏友谊纽带早日联接起来
    友谊铁路建筑人员展开竞赛
    新华社25日讯  据塔斯社阿克斗卡24日讯：友谊铁路正在从阿克斗卡向苏联和中国边境的草原伸延。测量路基的机械员在最前面，紧接着的是轨道敷设机以及建造住宅和生产性房屋的建筑人员。
    目前，全体人员正在展开竞赛，争取提高工作速度，以实际成绩来迎接十月革命四十周年。
    第一三七号建筑—安装列车的工作人员接到了重要的任务——铺轨。根据今年的计划，这个列车的全体青年应该铺设三万立方公尺的石碴和三十三公里铁路。这个任务已经提前完成了。为了庆祝十月革命节，建筑人员已经接受了新的任务——在11月7日以前再铺设三十三公里铁轨。
    由于获得这个成绩，这个列车的全体人员获得了苏联运输建设部和全苏工会中央理事会颁发的流动红旗。
