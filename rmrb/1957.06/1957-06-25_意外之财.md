　　"Windfall"
　　Chen Weilian
　　After a heated discussion, both departments and individuals formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Comrades actively used their brains and looked for ways to find ways to accumulate wealth for the country.
　　"Ah, I remember, I remember last year... no, it was the year before last when Old Yang was the accountant here, he gave me 100 yuan to order rattan (for weaving rattan chairs) from the Maoba District Commune in Renhuai County. Later, only a small amount of goods were received, and there may be some outstanding procedures." At the moment the chairman announced the adjournment, Comrade Zhang Baixuan suddenly remembered this.
　　Then he said, "Please have the accountant check the books to see how much the District Commune still owes us?"
　　This confused the accountant, Comrade Deng Jizhen. He went through all the accounts payable and receivable, but could not find any trace of it. In the past two years, personnel changes have been frequent, and the accountant has been changed several times. The original director has also been transferred away. No one knows about this account. Accountant Deng checked for several days and nights, but could not find the whereabouts of this account.
　　"Right, let me go..." Comrade Wang Huaian volunteered and said, "I will use the method of 'inducing confession' to find some clues." One day, Old Wang went to the Maoba District Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone and calmly began to "scam" the relevant comrades: "We still have some outstanding transactions that haven't been settled."
　　"How much do we owe you?" The tone was friendly.
　　"Oh, you don't need me to tell you, you also have the account, please check it and you will know."
　　"Okay..." After a while, perhaps the District Commune accountant had already checked the account, and indeed owed money, so he said, "Okay, I'll give you fifty yuan for now, and the balance will be settled later."
　　Old Wang happily brought back the money and handed it over to the accountant to be processed under the "extra income" subject. However, how much does the Maoba District Commune of Renhuai County owe the Shichang District Commune of Jinsha County? To this day, it is still a mystery.
　　The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. Because he was busy purchasing fat pigs, Comrade Jiang Shuqing of the Shichang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative came to the Xinzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingmu Township. As soon as he saw Chen Zexuan, the deputy director of the cooperative, he turned his head and said, "Director Chen, are the cooperative's fat pigs well-fed? Will you sell them to us?"
　　"Oh, Comrade Jiang, it's you!"
　　After a period of small talk, Director Chen said, "How long will it take for your supply and marketing cooperative to take back that big yellow bull you bought from Yang Zhizhong? If not, sell it to our cooperative!" This sudden question really confused Old Jiang. He had no idea what to say, so he vaguely said, "Let me ask for instructions first."
　　That night, Old Jiang returned to the District Commune and reported the matter to the leaders. He said, "It's been almost three years. Our cooperative spent 54 yuan to buy a big yellow bull from farmer Yang Zhizhong, and later handed it over to Li Zhanqing's family for feeding. No one has asked about it for several years." He paused and then said, "But this doesn't raise any problems. We can ask the seller Yang Zhizhong and the deputy director Chen Zexuan to testify."
　　Since the accountant and the director, and even all the staff, had never heard of a big yellow bull being fed on someone else's behalf, they of course went to check the account books again without saying anything. However, there was no trace of it in the account books!
　　Since there were both witnesses and physical evidence, the next day the Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately sent Wang Zhengrong and Old Jiang together to bring back a plump, big yellow bull.
　　The spirit of these comrades in the Shichang District Commune who actively tried to recover the "dead" wealth is worth learning from. But people can't help but ask: The relevant personnel who handled these two incidents in the past, what will you feel in your hearts after seeing this report today?

　　“意外之财”
　　陈渭濂
    经过一番热烈的讨论以后，部门和个人都订出了增产节约计划。同志们积极开动脑筋、想办法为国家寻找积累财富的窍门。
    “啊，我想起啦，记得去年……呀，不，还是前年老杨在这里当会计的时候，给了一百块钱要我到仁怀县毛坝区社订购藤条（编藤椅用），后来只收了很少的货，可能还有点手续未清。”当主席宣布散会的片刻，张柏宣同志突然想起这事。
    接着他说：“请会计到账上查查看，究竟区社还差我们多少？”
    这可把会计邓吉桢同志给迷惑住啦，他翻烂了所有的往来账，始终没个线线头头。近两年来，人事调动频繁，会计已经换了几个，原先的主任也早被调走了，这笔账问谁都不知道。邓会计一连查了几个昼夜，可总没有发现这笔账的下落。
    “对，让我去……”王怀安同志自告奋勇地说：“我将施以‘引供自招’的办法，到哪儿去找点线索。”一天，老王独个儿到了毛坝区供销社，对有关同志沉着地开始“诈”了：“我们之间还有点往来还没结清呢。”
    “欠你好多呀？”说话是和气的。
    “哦，这不用我说，你们也有账啰，请翻一下就知道啦。”
    “好……”过了不一回，也许是区社会计已经看过账了，果然欠钱，于是他说：“好，暂时给你五十块吧，余款待今后结算。”
    老王兴高采烈地带回来了钱，交给会计按“额外收益”科目处理了。但是，仁怀县毛坝区社究竟欠金沙县石场区社多少钱？直到今天还是个不解之迷。
    端阳节快到了，因为忙着收购肥猪，石场区供销社的蒋树青同志来到青木乡新寨农业生产社。一见该社副业主任陈泽轩，撇头就说：“陈主任，社里的肥猪喂得大不？卖给我们吗？”
    “哟，蒋同志，是你呀！”
    在一阵闲扯后，陈主任说：“你们供销社向杨志中买的那条大黄牯牛究竟要好久才牵回去哟？要不，就卖给我们社里嘛！”这一突如其来的问话，可真弄得老蒋丈二金刚摸不着头脑，他只好含糊地说了声：“请示请示再说吧。”
    当天晚上，老蒋回到区社便向领导汇报了这件事。他说：“快三年啦，我们社花去五十四元钱向农民杨志中买了条大黄牯牛，后来交给李占清家代喂，几年来没人过问。”他停了停然后说：“不过这倒不生问题，我们可请卖主杨志中、副业主任陈泽轩作证。”
    由于会计和主任甚至全体职工从未听说过有条大黄牯牛在请人代喂，当然是不用分说地又去翻账本了。然而，账上那里会有点墨只字呢！
    人证物证既然是有了，于是，第二天供销社即派王正荣和老蒋一道，把一条肥嘟嘟的大黄牯牛牵回来了。
    石场区社的这些同志积极设法收回已将“死去”的财富的精神，是值得学习的。但人们不禁要问：过去经办这两件事的有关人员，今天看到这个报导后，你们心里会有些什么感想呢？
