Xinhua News Agency, June 19th - Most rivers in the country have entered the flood season, and various regions have strengthened flood control work.

In early June, except for the Pearl River basin, which had the most rainfall, exceeding the average rainfall for the same period in previous years, and most areas of Hebei Province, which also exceeded the average rainfall for the same period in previous years, rainfall in other areas was not high. Therefore, except for the Pearl River, the water conditions of all rivers are relatively stable. On June 7th and 8th, the Qingyuan station on the North River of Guangdong and the Huiyang station on the East River experienced the largest flood peaks since the beginning of the flood season this year (both exceeding the guaranteed water level, and now have fallen back to the middle and normal water levels). In addition, only the Hong River and Shi River, tributaries of the Huai River, experienced their first flood peaks of the year on the 6th, with individual stations exceeding the warning water level. The water situation of the Yangtze River has been stable since the beginning of summer, and yesterday the water level at Wuhan Customs was more than four meters lower than on the same day last year. The water flow of the Han River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze River, and other rivers across the country are relatively stable.

Although the water conditions of all rivers are relatively stable, all regions have paid attention to flood control work. The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has taken measures to prevent the Yellow River from experiencing extraordinarily large floods, and will soon conduct inspections of flood control preparedness with relevant departments. The river affairs bureaus of Shandong and Henan provinces are also preparing to survey the river conditions and engineering conditions of the Yellow River this year in the near future. Hebei Province has generally repaired the river embankments of the frequently disaster-stricken Nan Yun, Daqing, Ziya and other rivers, and widened the embankment bodies in key sections; in order to reduce waterlogging, it has also newly built and repaired more than 3,000 mu of ditch and furrow farmland projects. The provinces along the Yangtze River have also established flood control command organizations. Hubei, Hunan and other provinces have also organized flood control armies based on past experience, closely monitoring changes in water conditions, and preparing to go to the dikes at any time to fight against floods. Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have generally inspected the dikes extending within their borders. The Jingjiang Dike, known as the "lifeline dike," which protects millions of acres of fertile land in the Jianghan Plain, is now being vigorously reinforced to enhance its flood resistance. A large number of emergency rescue and wave prevention materials needed for flood control have recently been rushed to the important dike sections on both sides of the Yangtze and Han Rivers. Jiangsu Province has also generally inspected the flood control projects such as the Yi River, Shu River Dikes, Hongze Lake Dike, Irrigation Main Canal and seawalls, carried out tens of thousands of dike cone soundings, eliminated dozens of hidden dangers, and strengthened the effectiveness of flood control projects.

　　汛期已到，防汛工作准备得怎样？
    新华社19日讯　全国大部河流已经进入汛期，各地都加强了防汛工作。
    6月上旬，除珠江流域降雨最多，超过历年同期平均雨量，河北省大部地区也超过了历年同期平均雨量外，其他地区降雨不多。因而目前除珠江外，各河水情都较平稳。本月7日、8日广东北江清远站和东江惠阳站分别出现过今年入汛以来最大的一次洪峰（都超过了保证水位，现已回落到中常水位）。此外，仅淮河支流洪河和史河在6日出现过今年的首次洪峰，个别站超过警戒水位。长江水情入夏以来一直平稳，昨天武汉关水位比去年同一天低四公尺多。长江最大的支流汉水和全国其它河流水势都较平稳。
    尽管各河水情都较平稳，但是各地还是注意了防汛的工作。黄河防汛总指挥部已采取措施以防黄河发生特大洪水，并即将会同有关部门检查防汛准备工作。山东、河南两省的河务局，也准备在最近查勘今年的黄河河势和工情。河北省对经常闹灾的南运、大清、子牙等河的河堤普遍进行了整修，加宽了重点地段的堤身；为减少内涝，还新修和整修三千多亩的沟洫畦田工程。沿长江各省也已建立了防汛指挥机构，湖北、湖南等省还根据历年经验，组织了防汛大军，密切注视着水情变化，准备随时上堤与洪水进行斗争。湖北、安徽、江苏等省，对绵延境内的堤防，普遍进行了检查，被人们称为“命堤”，保卫着江汉平原数百万亩肥田沃野的荆江大堤，现在正大力加固，以增强抗洪能力。防汛所需的大批抢险，防浪等器材，最近也都正向长江、汉水两岸的重要堤段赶运。江苏省还对沂、沭河堤、洪泽湖大堤、灌溉总渠及海塘等防汛工程普遍进行了检查，堤防锥探数万眼，消灭隐患数十处，加强了防洪工程的效能。
