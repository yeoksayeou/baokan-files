Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: Tokyo News: The Japan-China Import and Export Association held an emergency board meeting in Tokyo on June 7th and decided that the trade associations participating in the association would work together to ensure that the Japanese government would realize the demands for lifting the embargo against China put forward by the three Japan-China trade groups. The meeting also called on the Japanese government, industry, and trade circles to unite and establish a system to expand Japan-China trade.

The Japan-China Import and Export Association will continue to hold a meeting with Japanese economic organizations on June 13th to discuss the issue of trade with China.

The Japan-China Trade Association held a board meeting on June 6th and decided that in order to realize the unanimous demands of the Japanese economic community regarding the relaxation and lifting of the embargo against China, the Japan-China Trade Association will submit requests to the speakers of both houses of the Japanese Diet and various political parties, encouraging them to resolutely urge the Japanese government to realize this urgent demand.

The Japan International Trade Promotion Association held a joint meeting on the 6th with twelve economic organizations, including the Japan Plant Export Association and the Japan Machinery Export Association, and decided to launch active activities to request Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to decide on the Japanese government's policy on relaxing the embargo against China and concluding the fourth Japan-China trade agreement before visiting the United States.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Trade Union Conference, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the Socialist Party, as well as women's groups and trade groups will jointly hold a national convention on June 15th to make demands on the United States. The content of this conference will also include issues such as demanding the lifting of the embargo against China, expanding Japan-China trade, and restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

More and more important figures in the Japanese economic community are demanding that Japan take positive and independent action to increase trade with China. Den Kawakatsu, general manager of Japan Textile Spindle Manufacturing Company, wrote an article in the English-language "Japan Times" on the 5th, saying that Japan should not only follow the British example, but Japan should play a major role in easing the embargo. He believes that Japan should formulate new policies in order to gain a place in China's second five-year plan, which will begin next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: According to Kyodo News, the Japanese government intends to temporarily implement the Category A "compromise plan" recognized by the United States at the meeting of the "China Committee" on restricting trade with China, while "mediating" with the United States and the United Kingdom on the issue of relaxing restrictions on the embargo against China.

According to Kyodo News, the "compromise plan" "does not greatly relax restrictions." The content of this plan includes: removing approximately one hundred and sixty items from the embargoed goods list; lifting a portion of more than forty kinds of goods that the United States believes need to continue to be restricted; and applying "exception clauses" to most goods that the United States insists on continuing to embargo.

Kyodo News said that because the United Kingdom has already independently implemented the relaxation of "embargo" restrictions, the Japanese government will implement this so-called "compromise plan" as a "minimum" measure.

The Japanese government's policy will soon be submitted to Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi for decision.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said at the National Governors' Conference of Japan, which opened on June 7th, that he hoped to promote Japan's trade with China as much as possible. To this end, the Japanese government is working to relax trade restrictions on China.

Nobusuke Kishi still insists on his attitude of not recognizing China, and he believes that now is not the time for Japan to establish diplomatic relations with China. When he talked about the mutual dispatch of trade delegations between Japan and China, he said that government agencies cannot recognize them, but private institutions can be given as much convenience as possible.

Nobusuke Kishi emphasized his foreign policy of Japan strengthening solidarity with so-called "free countries," and he believes that explaining this to "red countries" is "very important" for Japan. Nobusuke Kishi will soon visit the United States.

    主张效法英国先例采取独立行动
    日本要求撤销禁运运动日益壮大
    日本政府打算实行对中国禁运的“折衷方案”
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日中输出入协会6月7日在东京召开的紧急理事会会议决定，参加这个协会的贸易会，将一致努力使日中贸易三团体向日本政府提出的撤销禁运的要求得到实现。会议并且呼吁日本政府和产业界、贸易界团结一致，建立扩大日中贸易的体制。
    日中输出入协会将在6月13日继续同日本的经济团体举行会议，讨论对中国贸易问题。
    中日贸易会在6月6日举行的理事会会议决定，为了实现日本经济界关于放宽和撤销对中国禁运的一致要求，中日贸易会将向日本国会两院议长和各政党提出要求，勉励他们坚决使日本政府实现这个迫切的要求。
    日本国际贸易促进协会在6日同日本全套设备输出协会、日本机械输出协会等十二个经济团举行的联席会议，决定要展开积极活动，要求岸信介首相在访问美国以前决定日本政府对放宽对中国的禁运和缔结第四次日中贸易协定的方针。
    日本工会总评议会、全日本工会会议、全日本学生自治会总联合会、社会党以及妇女团体和贸易团体将在6月15日联合举行向美国提出要求的国民大会，这次大会的内容也将包括要求撤销对中国禁运、扩大日中贸易和恢复日中邦交的问题。
    愈来愈多的日本经济界重要人士要求日本采取积极的独立行动来增加同中国的贸易。日本纺锭制造公司总经理川胜传5日在英文“日本时报”上写文章说，日本应该不仅仅是效法英国的先例，日本要在放宽禁运方面起主要的作用。他认为，日本应该制订出新的政策，以便在明年开始的中国第二个五年计划中占有一席之地。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，日本政府打算在对美国和英国关于放宽对中国的禁运限制问题进行“调停”期间，暂时实施美国在限制对中国贸易的“中国委员会”会议上所承认的甲项“折衷方案”。
    据共同社透露，这项“折衷方案”“放宽程度不大”。这项方案的内容包括：解除禁运货单上的大约一百六十项货物；解除美国认为需要继续加以限制的四十多种货物的一部分；对大部分美国主张继续禁运的货物可以适用“例外条款”。
    共同社说，由于英国已经单独实行放宽“禁运”限制，所以日本政府要把这个所谓“折衷方案”作为“最低限度”的办法来付诸实施。
    日本政府的这个方针，不久将交给首相岸信介决定。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介在6月7日开幕的日本全国知事会议上说，他希望尽可能地促进日本同中国的贸易，为此，日本政府正在努力放宽对中国的贸易限制。
    岸信介依然坚持他的不承认中国的态度，他认为现在不是日本同中国建立外交关系的时候。他在谈到日中互派贸易代表团的时候说，政府机构不能承认，私人机构倒可以得到尽可能多的方便。
    岸信介强调了他的日本要同所谓“自由国家”加强团结的外交政策，他认为向“赤色国家”说明这一点对日本来说是“很重要”的。岸信介不久就要到美国去访问。
