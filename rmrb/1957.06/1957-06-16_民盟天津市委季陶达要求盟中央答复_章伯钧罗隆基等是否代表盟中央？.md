Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th -- The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League passed a resolution at an enlarged meeting held on the 14th, suggesting that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League immediately convene an emergency meeting to solemnly express its attitude to the people of the whole country. The resolution also called on all members of the League in the city to thoroughly refute all reactionary remarks and resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party.
　　
Ji Taoda, a Standing Committee member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, asked whether the opinions of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc. represent the Central Committee of the League? If they represent the Central Committee of the League, the Central Committee should examine the League's political line. If they are only their own opinions, the Central Committee also has the responsibility to consider: First, how to help them examine and recognize their mistakes and improve them; second, in case they are determined not to change or play double-dealing tricks, whether it is appropriate to continue to do the leadership work of the League.
　
Xu Jingxing, a Standing Committee member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said that our municipal committee has also received letters from some serious lawbreakers during the "Five-Anti" campaign and people who are extremely hostile to the Communist Party, asking Luo Longji and others to help them "rehabilitate." Obviously, Luo Longji and these people have become the callers and supporters for those who were originally hiding in dark corners to openly carry out anti-Party clamoring.

　　民盟天津市委季陶达要求盟中央答复
　　章伯钧罗隆基等是否代表盟中央？
    据新华社天津15日电　民盟天津市委员会在14日举行的扩大会议上通过决议，建议民盟中央立即召开紧急会议向全国人民严正表明态度。决议并号召全市盟员对一切反动言论给以彻底驳斥，坚决地在共产党领导下走社会主义道路。
    民盟天津市委员会常务委员季陶达提出，章伯钧、罗隆基等人的意见是否代表盟中央？如果代表盟中央，盟中央就应检查盟的政治路线。如果只是他们自己的意见，盟中央也有责任考虑：一、如何帮助他们检查和认识自己的错误，加以改进；二、万一他们坚决不改或耍两面手段，是否适宜于继续做盟的领导工作。
    民盟天津市委员会常务委员徐景星说，我们盟市委也收到过一些“五反”时的严重违法户和极端仇视共产党的人的来信，要求罗隆基等帮助他们“平反”。显然，罗隆基这些人已成为那些原来躲在黑暗角落里的人公开出来进行反党叫嚣的号召者与支持者。
