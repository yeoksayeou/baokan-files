    China to Utilize Hydraulic Mining
    Soviet Union Helps Complete Hydraulic Coal Mine Design Work
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th. Chinese engineers and technicians, with the assistance of Soviet engineers, have designed China's first hydraulic coal mine. The coal mine will have an annual output of 600,000 tons.
    According to "Labor News," a group of Chinese designers are working with Soviet experts at the All-Union Hydraulic Coal Mining Research Institute in Stalino to design the coal mine. The design has been completed.
    Hydraulic mining is a new type of coal mining method that can triple productivity, reduce basic construction costs by half, and reduce the number of coal miners by 40%. According to the experience of Kuzbass in the Soviet Union, the cost of hydraulic mining is half that of ordinary mines, timber consumption is greatly reduced, and manpower is also greatly reduced.

    我国将利用水力采煤
    苏联帮助完成水力采煤矿设计工作
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联工程技术人员帮助中国设计了第一座水力采煤矿。这座煤矿的年产量是六十万吨。
    据“劳动报”报道，有一批中国的设计人员在斯大林诺的全苏水力采煤研究所和苏联专家一道进行这个煤矿的设计工作。设计已经完成。
    水力采煤是新式的采煤方法，它可以使生产率提高三倍，基本建设费用降低一半，采煤工人减少40％。根据苏联库兹巴斯的经验，水力采煤的成本比普通矿井降低一半，木材消耗大大减少，人力也减少很多。
