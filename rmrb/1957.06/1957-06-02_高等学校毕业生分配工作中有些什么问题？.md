Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Bogong reported: Summer vacation is approaching, and tens of thousands of college graduates will soon be assigned to participate in the country's socialist construction. The reporter recently conducted some investigations on the issue of college graduate allocation, which is of concern to everyone, with relevant departments.

From 1949 to 1956, there were more than 300,200 graduates from colleges and universities across the country. The government began to implement unified allocation of their work in 1950, ensuring the supply of specialized talents for national construction and enabling college graduates to obtain appropriate work. However, there are still some problems with unified allocation and the training of specialized talents. The following records some of the problems seen in this investigation and the views of people in the education sector on these issues.

	“Market Problems”

The "market" referred to here refers to the "caliber problem" usually mentioned in the education sector, that is, the relationship between the supply and demand of college graduates and the country's construction endeavors. The situation of this supply and demand relationship has always been one of demand exceeding supply over the years, showing tension. The specialized construction talents trained by schools cannot fully meet the needs of national socialist construction. According to preliminary statistics from relevant central departments, this year, although the number of graduates is relatively large and the number of people needed by various departments has decreased sharply, graduates can only meet approximately 75% of the actual needs. Last year, various departments proposed needing 180,000 college graduates, but the actual number of graduates allocated only reached a little more than 30% of the number needed. This tense situation of demand exceeding supply is particularly evident in some engineering majors. This year, the country needs 4.9 times the actual number of graduates in engineering geology and hydrogeology. The number of people needed for mine surveying is 5.2 times the number of graduates. The number of people needed for terrestrial hydrological surveying is 54.6 times the number of graduates. The number of people needed for welding is 11.2 times the number of graduates. Most other majors in mining, power, metallurgy, machinery, electrical engineering, civil engineering, transportation, postal and telecommunications, food industry, as well as science, medicine, philosophy, and other majors, have few graduates and large demand. Therefore, the science, education, and industrial sectors, between industrial sectors, and between the central and local governments, all have a phenomenon of competing for engineering graduates every year. Last year, various departments even created a stalemate in order to strive for more graduates, affecting the review and approval of the allocation plan.

Another situation is that the "market" is oversupplied, and the country's construction undertakings do not need many graduates in certain majors or do not need them for the time being. The most prominent this year is the difficulty in allocating Russian language graduates. This year, there are more than 3,000 extra Russian language graduates. In addition to relevant departments taking measures to assign some students to work, the Higher Education Department will retain some students at the school for further study and improvement. Other majors such as automobile and tractor, oil exploitation, pharmacy, pharmaceutical manufacturing, supply and marketing cooperatives, finance and credit, higher plants, marine animals, animal embryology, history, Eastern languages, and some majors in higher normal schools also have a surplus of graduates. Among them, finance and credit, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other majors have had more graduates than actually needed in the past two years.

Although the figures for the number of graduates needed by society cited in the above situations of tight supply and oversupply may not fully reflect the actual needs of society and may still change, they can still show the general state of demand.

In our country's construction undertakings, everyone is calling for a lack of specialized talents, but why are specialized talents such as oil exploitation, which are very much needed in construction, in surplus instead? People in the education sector believe that the main reason for this phenomenon is that we lack experience in running construction and planning to train cadres according to construction majors. When the state formulates plans to train cadres, it does not sufficiently study the needs of construction undertakings, especially the proportions between various majors; in addition, the state's construction plans are constantly revised in the implementation process, while colleges and universities must recruit students and train them for four or five years, making it difficult to change majors mid-way through their studies. People in the education sector believe that the factors affecting the balance between college graduates and construction undertakings are extremely complex, and it is difficult to ensure that graduates fully meet the requirements of construction undertakings. Capitalist countries do not have this problem; they have "free" employment and "free" unemployment. The socialist country's system of planned cadre training should basically not have unemployment problems. However, due to the needs of various departments for specialized cadres and the blindness of planning departments in formulating plans, as well as a lack of investigation and research, many phenomena of plans deviating from reality are artificially created. For example, in the training of Russian language cadres, although this year the need for Russian language translators has decreased due to the reduction of Soviet experts and some new situations such as factory and enterprise designs originally planned to be done abroad being changed to domestic design, it seems that the Russian language major has developed too much in the long run. The First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and other departments that need more Russian language translators currently have a large number of Russian language translators, but they do not have many work tasks, and many translators are idle and have nothing to do. Schools are still constantly training batches of graduates. Therefore, some people have suggested that it is worth reconsidering whether it is necessary to set up eight foreign language institutions nationwide that focus on training Russian language translators. In addition, students majoring in Korean, whose application range is not large, also have a surplus of students this year. Some people have suggested that it is worth considering whether it is necessary to specifically run a major at Peking University for students in this major, which does not require a large number of students, or whether Yanbian University in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture can train them incidentally.

The degree of precision in the division of majors is related to the employment of graduates. There is now a debate in the education sector about the breadth of majors, and there is no conclusion yet. The narrower the major, the more difficult it is to align with the "caliber." If the major is too broad, it is easy to train students to become generalists. However, judging from the situation of this year's graduates, some majors that are too specific restrict the adaptability of their graduates to work. According to the materials of the Ministry of Higher Education, there are 19 mathematical specializations and 20 physics specializations set up in colleges and universities across the country. A mathematician said that it would be sufficient to set up five or six mathematical specializations. Last year, 240 majors and specializations were set up in higher industrial schools across the country, while the Soviet Union only set up 174 majors and specializations in the same period. China's industry is far behind the Soviet Union in terms of scale or technology, but our majors are more finely divided than those in the Soviet Union. In addition, we are all trained according to the latest Soviet technical standards, while the actual backward equipment still accounts for a considerable proportion. Therefore, it is often difficult for students to fully exert their strengths after graduation. This creates the danger of students changing careers or even becoming unemployed in the "market" after graduation.

	More than 10,000 people request job adjustments

Since 1950, the vast majority of the work assignments of more than 300,000 students have been reasonable, and a small number of students have been assigned improperly. According to partial statistics from the State Council Personnel Bureau from 1953 to 1956 (August-December 1953, 1954, first half of 1955, August-December 1956), 11,834 college graduates requested adjustments to their work after being assigned, accounting for 5.4% of the total number of graduates in this period, which was 219,175. Graduates have been constantly writing or personally coming to Beijing from all over the country to appeal, believing that the work assigned to them is not suitable and requesting readjustment. From December 15 last year to the end of March this year, the Personnel Bureau still received letters from 6,723 graduates requesting job adjustments. The Higher Education Department and the Personnel Bureau received the most student visitors in the second half of last year, reaching more than 100 people per day at the most, and now the Personnel Bureau still receives 50 or 60 people on each reception day.

The most frequent reason for students requesting job adjustments is that their studies and work are inconsistent, and they have changed careers after graduation. In August last year, the Higher Education Department analyzed the situation reflected by 1,117 graduates who wrote and visited, and 670 people were improperly used, accounting for 59.98% of the total number of letters. Most of the improper use was not using what they had learned. Among the students requesting job adjustments, there were mathematics graduates who were assigned to factories to work as Russian teachers; physics graduates who were assigned to publishing houses to work as proofreaders; electrical engineering graduates who were assigned to film processing plants to install electric lights and small motors; organic chemistry students who were assigned to bicycle factories to do inorganic analysis and electroplating processes, which were completely opposite to what they had learned; a structural engineering graduate from Tongji University was assigned to an engineering unit and arranged to answer phones, receive and send documents, cut stencils, copy, and print documents.

There are also a large number of graduates who are assigned to work posts where these work units are already overstaffed, and they have nothing to do after they arrive. In 1955, the Higher Education Department retained 1.5% of last year's graduates for various colleges and universities. These students do political work in the schools, and many of them expressed that they were not at ease and hoped to be adjusted.

The contradiction between students' aspirations and national needs is also very large. Last year, engineering graduates generally wanted to work in scientific institutions, colleges and universities, or design departments, and were unwilling to go to factories, construction sites, or secondary vocational schools for teaching work; Chinese language graduates were unwilling to go to ordinary middle schools for teaching work; medical graduates hoped to work in large hospitals and were unwilling to go to health centers or small clinics in remote areas and inland provinces; agricultural graduates were also unwilling to go to agricultural production units and hoped to stay in research institutions or agricultural and forestry administrative agencies. Many people also requested job adjustments due to these situations. A small number of students also requested job adjustments because they needed to take care of their families, had financial difficulties, had poor health, or had ideological problems.

In the students' letters and visits, they also reflected some situations of blindly allocating graduates. Last summer, a group of medical graduates were assigned to work in a construction engineering company. When the students reported to the designated location, they found that the company's hospital had not yet been established. The sports department even adopted the method of "releasing kites on a long line," transferring the teachers needed for the "medical sports" course to be opened by the sports college in 1958 and 1960 in advance last year. As a result, the students had nothing to do after being assigned to this department. Some units adopted the method of kicking the ball around to graduates. The Second Ministry of Machine Building transferred five Russian language graduates from Shanghai to Beijing, from Beijing to a factory in Sichuan, which the factory did not want, and then transferred them to Nanjing. A casting major student from Jiaotong University last year was assigned to the Ministry of Geology, but was kicked around several times by several units under the Ministry of Geology. Finally, he was introduced to a repair factory in Hengyang. After the student arrived in Hengyang, he found that the factory would not start construction until 1958 and did not need people at present.

Most of these more than 10,000 students' requests have been resolved. However, some employing departments only do ideological mobilization work for students who request job adjustments, and rarely rearrange their work according to their specialties and reasonable wishes. Some even adopt crude methods, such as stopping work, not paying wages, or suspending them for self-reflection, to restrict them from transferring their jobs. A graduate from the Power Department of Nanjing Institute of Technology was assigned to a vocational school for colored mineral industries in Yunnan to teach a course he had not learned. He requested a job transfer, and the leader of the school said that requesting a job transfer was an ideological problem, and not being at ease with work meant not liking revolutionary work, and criticized him in a general meeting.

Regarding this issue, experts believe that the main reason lies in the fact that the state planning and allocation departments do not have sufficient knowledge of the actual needs, and the employing units are acting in their own interests and do not respect the students' professional knowledge. The national quota and quota system has not yet been established. How many people a unit needs, what kind of talents it needs, and what specific business work they will be responsible for are very complex situations. There is still a lack of systematic research on these situations, and the training goals and use directions of various majors are not yet fully understood. The method of allocating to relevant business departments according to majors can no longer adapt to the current needs. Employing units also lack detailed research on the specific business of their affiliated undertakings, so there is a certain degree of blindness in the use of cadres. Coupled with the ideology of departmentalism, it further exacerbates the shortcomings in treating graduate work. A few local employing units even adopt the practice of not asking about majors when assigning work. The person in charge of some units even said: College students can do anything, and it is the same to do anything. It will be good to train them.

However, experts believe that it is difficult for students to fully match their studies with their work. In addition to the overall planning and supply and demand issues mentioned above, it is difficult for the country's needs to be 100% consistent with the school's professional education and students' aspirations. When the talents urgently needed by the country are very scarce, it is still very necessary to allow a small number of students with similar professional backgrounds to change careers to supplement them. Therefore, in this sense, experts believe that the government's principle of "implementing the unity of learning and application on the basis of national needs" is reasonable, but it is inappropriate to excessively emphasize national needs and obliterate students' professional knowledge in the implementation process.

Regarding students' aspirations, experts believe that some are worthy of sympathy, but the contradictions with actual requirements are very large and difficult to resolve. For example, medical graduates should theoretically be assigned to larger hospitals in cities first, allowing experienced doctors to lead them for two or three years, and then sending them to health centers or clinics in areas far from cities, which is more appropriate. It is very difficult for a new graduate to cover internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, etc. all at once, and only doctors with considerable experience can take on this task. However, in the current situation where inland provinces, remote areas, and industrial and mining enterprises urgently need people, students can only be asked to consider their work issues more from the perspective of national needs. As for not wanting to go to actual production units and wanting to stay in scientific units and colleges and universities, this should be analyzed according to each person's specific situation. If there are students with a very good theoretical foundation and research ability, their aspirations should be respected. However, most of these problems belong to ideological understanding problems. They mainly have an excessively narrow understanding of the significance of marching towards science, believing that only in scientific institutions and colleges and universities can they improve their theories, and neglecting the importance of research and improvement in practice.

Students who make ideological troubles are a minority, and educators believe that they should be persuaded and educated. Individual students who make unreasonable demands should not be sympathized with. For example, last year a graduate couple from Shandong Agricultural College was originally assigned to Anhui Province, but they were not working in the same area, so they requested adjustment. After consultation with the relevant departments, they were transferred to work in the same unit, but they also requested to work in the same office. After being transferred to work in the same office, they still did not do it. There are still some students in similar situations. Among this year's graduates, the slogan of "abandoning the Northeast" has already been put forward. Engineering graduates are unwilling to go to work in the Northeast, which is wrong both from the perspective of national requirements and their own development. Therefore, experts criticize the government for not being overly accommodating to them.

	Some approaches worth studying

Many professors reflect that the current allocation of college graduates is too centralized, too tightly controlled, and the implementation of democratic spirit in the allocation methods is not sufficient. The implementation of the mass line from allocation to transfer is not sufficient, which is also one of the main reasons for improper allocation and inconsistency between students' studies and work. Now, the formulation of deployment plans does not follow the mass line of "producers" and "consumers." It neither solicits the opinions of professors who are familiar with the students' majors and specialties, nor does it understand the specific needs of the employing units. Once the plan is formulated and announced, it is difficult to change. Professors especially object to not soliciting their opinions when retaining teaching assistants, and forcibly assigning some students with poor professional skills who are not suitable as teaching assistants to teaching and research offices, causing great difficulties in teaching. Some professors said: Teachers have worked hard to train students for several years and know them very well, but they have no say in their work. Many students write to their teachers to complain after being assigned to unsuitable jobs, and the professors also say they cannot help. Students usually graduate at the end of June and the beginning of July. Before and after graduation, various schools often focus on ideological education, mobilizing students to obey the assignment, and holding continuous large and small meetings, but they rarely solicit the opinions of teachers and students. In this atmosphere of mobilization and education, students are afraid to raise their opinions. The school's personnel department mystifies the allocation work, keeps everything confidential, and adopts simple methods. Some schools announce the list in a general meeting in the morning, send them off at noon, and the students get on the train in the afternoon. Some students do not even know which unit they have been assigned to and what work they will do until they get on the train. So many students only "obey the organization, but their ideology is not clear" when they arrive at their work posts.

Professors suggested that it is also problematic to have the talent training plan, training, allocation, and use of specialized talents led by several different entities. In particular, if the planning, training, and allocation departments cannot well grasp the needs of the employing departments and their use of graduates, it will be difficult to do a good job in the allocation of graduates. Moreover, problems in one link of the leadership of several entities affect the overall situation. An example is the annual allocation plan being delayed for a long time. The State Economic Commission, which is responsible for allocation, cannot finalize the plan due to a lack of information from the employing departments. The Ministry of Higher Education, which is responsible for transfer, can only let the students wait without a plan. If there are problems with the allocation of students, the State Council Personnel Bureau is responsible for adjustment. It is worth studying how these departments can unify leadership and cooperate with each other.

Recently, many professors, including some school leaders, have raised the issue of opening a "free market" in the allocation of college graduates. They advocate leaving an opening so that some students can find employment freely. The government is still responsible for allocating students' jobs, and if students do not accept the jobs assigned by the government, they can find their own jobs. Some departments can also freely recruit. Students who have already been assigned to work posts can also find their own jobs if they think the work is not suitable. Professors generally require expanding democracy in the allocation of graduates, following the mass line, and changing the past situation of the school's personnel department taking care of everything. The school allocation committee should absorb relevant professors to participate, and the allocation committee should truly become an institution with functions and powers, mobilizing teachers and students to discuss, and allowing the school to communicate directly with the employing units to jointly study the allocation and use of students. This year's graduates are about to end their studies, and professors hope that the allocation plan will be finalized as soon as possible and the allocation work will be effectively improved.

### 高等学校毕业生分配工作中有些什么问题？

    高等学校毕业生分配工作中有些什么问题？
    新华社1日讯　新华社记者王伯恭报道：暑假快要到来了，几万名高等学校应届毕业生不久将被分配参加国家社会主义建设事业。记者最近就大家所关心的高等学校毕业生分配问题向有关部门作了一些调查。
    从1949年到1956年，全国高等学校共有三十万零二千多名毕业生。政府从1950年开始对他们的工作实行统一分配，保证了国家建设事业专门人材的供应，使高等学校毕业生都获得了适当的工作。但是，统一分配和专门人材的培养仍存在一些问题。下面记载的就是从这次调查中看到的一些问题和教育界人士对这些问题的看法。
          “市场问题”
    这里所谈的“市场”，指教育界通常提的“口径问题”，即高等学校毕业生和国家建设事业之间的供求关系问题。这种供求关系历年的情况总是供不应求，表现紧张。学校培养的专门建设人材，不能全部满足国家社会主义建设的需要。根据中央有关部门的初步统计材料，今年虽然在毕业生人数较多而各部门需要人数锐减的情况下，毕业生也大约只能满足实际需要75％。去年各部门曾提出需要高等学校毕业生十八万人，实际配备的毕业生只达到需要数的30％多一点。这种供不应求的紧张状况，特别表现在工科一部分专业上。今年国家需要工程地质专业和水文地质专业的毕业生人数，为实际毕业生数的四点九倍。矿山测量需要人数为毕业生数的五点二倍。陆地水文测量需要人数为毕业生数的五十四点六倍。焊接需要人数为毕业生数的十一点二倍。其他采矿、动力、冶金、机械、电机、土建、运输、邮电、食品工业大部分专业和理科、医科、哲学等专业，都是毕业生少，需要量大。因此，科学、教育、产业各部门，产业部门之间，中央和地方，每年都发生争用工科毕业生的现象。去年各部门甚至为了争取多用毕业生，曾造成相持不下的局面，影响到分配方案的审订。
    另一种情况就是“市场”供过于求，国家建设事业对某些专业的毕业生需要不多或暂时还不需要。今年最突出的是俄文毕业生分配困难。俄文毕业生今年多出三千多人，除有关部门采取措施，分配一部分学生工作外，高等教育部将留一部分学生在校学习，继续提高。其他如汽车拖拉机专业，石油开采、药学、制药、供销合作、财政信贷、高等植物、海洋动物、动物胚胎、历史、东语和高等师范部分专业，都多出一部分毕业生。其中财政信贷、制药等专业近两年的毕业生都多于实际需要。
    以上供求紧张和供过于求的情况中所引用的社会需要的毕业生数字，虽然不一定完全反映社会实际需要，并且可能还有改变，但仍可以看出一般需要量的状况。
    在我们国家建设事业中，到处在喊叫专门人材缺乏，但为什么像石油开采等类在建设中十分需要的专门人材，反而多出来呢？教育界人士认为产生这种现象的主要原因，在于我们办建设和根据建设专业有计划地培养干部的工作，还缺乏经验。国家在制订培养干部计划时，对建设事业的需要情况，特别是各种专业之间的比例研究不够；加上国家建设计划在实施中不断修改，而高等学校招收学生须经过四、五年的培养，很难在学习中途改变专业。教育界人士认为影响高等学校毕业生和建设事业之间的供求平衡的因素，是极为复杂的，要作到毕业生完全满足建设事业的要求，也是困难的。资本主义国家不存在这个问题，他们是就业“自由”，失业也“自由”。社会主义国家有计划培养干部的制度，基本上不应发生失业问题。但是，由于各个部门对专业干部的需要和计划部门制订计划的盲目性，缺乏调查研究，也人为地造成许多计划脱离实际的现象。例如俄文干部的培养方面，固然今年由于苏联专家减少和一部分原计划在国外作的工厂企业设计后来改在国内设计等新情况，需要俄文翻译人材减少，但从长远来说，俄文专业似乎发展太大了。需要俄文翻译较多的第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、冶金工业部等，目前都拥有大批俄文翻译，但工作任务不多，许多翻译已闲着没事干。而学校仍不断培养出一批批的毕业生。因此，有人提出现在全国设置以培养俄文翻译人材为主的八所外文院校是否必要，值得重新考虑。此外，像朝鲜文专业学生应用范围不大，今年也多了一部分学生，有人提出像这种需要量不大的专业学生，在延边朝鲜族自治州的延边大学就可以顺便培养，是否需要在北京大学专门办一个专业，也值得考虑。
    专业划分的粗细同毕业生的就业有关，现在教育界有专业宽窄之争，还没有定论，专业越窄，越难对准口径，专业若是过宽，又容易培养学生成为通才。但是，从今年毕业生的情况看，有些过细的专业，它的毕业生对工作的适应性很受限制。根据高等教育部的材料，全国高等学校中设置的数学专门化达十九个，物理专门化二十个。一位数学家表示，数学专门化设五、六个就可以了。去年全国高等工业学校设置了二百四十个专业和专门化，而苏联在同一时期内只设置一百七十四个专业和专门化。中国的工业无论在规模或技术方面比起苏联来都差得很远，但我们的专业却比苏联还分得精细。加上我们都是按照苏联最新技术标准培养的，而实际落后的设备仍占相当大的比重，因此，往往学生毕业以后，很难完全发挥他的所长。这就造成学生毕业后在“市场”上要改行就业甚至有失业的危险。
    一万多人要求调整工作
    从1950年以来，三十多万学生的工作分配绝大部分是合理的，少部分学生分配不当。据国务院人事局从1953年到1956年的部分统计材料（1953年8月—12月， 1954年，1955年上半年，1956年8月—12月），高等学校毕业生中有一万一千八百三十四人在工作分配以后要求调整他们的工作，占这个时期毕业生总数二十一万九千一百七十五人的5.4％。毕业生们不断从全国各地来信或亲自到北京来申诉，认为分配给他们的工作不合适，要求重新调整。从去年12月15日到今年3月底为止，给人事局写信要求调整工作的毕业生仍有六千七百二十三人。高等教育部门和人事局去年下半年接待来访学生，最多的时候每天达一百多人，现在人事局每个接待日还要接待五、六十人。
    要求调整工作的学生最多的是因为学用不一致，毕业以后就改了行。高等教育部在去年8月份对来信来访的一千一百一十七个毕业生反映的情况分析，使用不当的有六百七十人，占来信总人数59.98％。使用不当大部分是用非所学。在要求调整工作的学生中，有数学系毕业生被分配到工厂作俄文教员；物理系毕业生被分配到出版社作校对；电机系毕业生被分配到电影洗印厂担任安装电灯、小马达等工作；有机化学专业学生被分配到自行车厂做同他所学完全相反的无机分析和电镀工艺方面的工作；同济大学一个结构系毕业生，分配到一个工程单位以后竟被安排作接电话、收发、刻蜡纸、复写、印文件等工作。
    还有大批毕业生分配到工作岗位以后，这些工作单位本来就人浮于事，他们去了以后也没有什么事干。1955年高等教育部留给各高等学校的毕业生占去年全部毕业生的1.5％，这些学生在学校作政治工作，许多人表示不安心，希望调整。
    学生志愿和国家需要的矛盾也很大。去年工科毕业生一般愿意到科学机关、高等学校或设计部门工作，不愿下厂下工地和到中等专业学校作教学工作；中文系毕业生不愿到普通中学作教学工作；医科毕业生希望在大医院工作，不愿到边远地区、内地省份的卫生所或小的门诊部；农科毕业生也不愿到农业生产单位工作，希望留在研究机关或农林行政机关里。由于这些情况要求调整工作的也很多。还有少部分学生因为需要照顾家庭、经济困难、健康状况不良或者思想问题而要求调整工作。
    在学生们来信来访中，还反映出一些对毕业生盲目调配的情况。去年暑期，有一批医科毕业生被分配到一个建筑工程公司工作，学生到指定地点报到时，才发现这个公司的医院还没有建立。体育运动部门甚至采取“长线放远鸢”的办法，把1958年和1960年体育学院需要开设的“医疗体育”课师资，提前在去年就调去了，结果学生被分配到这个部门以后没有事做。有的单位对毕业生采取踢皮球的办法，第二机械工业部调去五个俄文毕业生，由上海调到北京，由北京调到四川一个工厂，这个工厂不要，又调到南京去。交通大学去年铸工专科一个学生被分配到地质部后，被地质部所属几个单位踢来踢去好几次，最后被介绍到衡阳一个修配厂，这个学生到衡阳后，才发现这个厂要到1958年才开工，目前并不需要人。
    这一万多学生的要求，大部分得到了解决。但是也有些用人部门对要求调整工作的学生，只单纯作思想动员工作，很少根据学生的特长和他们合理的愿望，重新安排他们的工作，有的甚至采取粗暴的办法，用停止工作、不发工资或停职反省手段，限制他们调动工作岗位。南京工学院动力系一个毕业生分配在云南一个有色矿业技工学校去教他并没有学过的课。他要求调动工作，这个学校的领导人说，要求调整工作就是思想问题，不安心工作就是不喜欢革命工作，并开大会批评他。
    关于这个问题，专家们的意见认为主要在于国家计划分配部门对实际需要情况掌握不够，和用人单位的本位主义，对学生专业知识尊重不够。现在国家定员定额制度还没有确立，一个单位需要多少人，需要什么样的人材，具体担任什么业务工作，这些情况十分复杂，现在还缺乏系统的研究，对各种专业的培养目标和使用方向，也还不十分熟悉。按专业分配到有关业务部门的办法已不能适应当前的需要。用人单位对所属事业的具体业务也缺乏细致的研究，因此在使用干部上就存在一定的盲目性，加上本位主义思想，就更助长对待毕业生工作的缺点。少数地方用人单位甚至还在分配工作时采用不问专业的作法。有的单位负责人员竟然说：大学生嘛，什么都会作，作什么都一样，锻炼锻炼就好了。
    但是，专家们认为学生要完全学用一致也是困难的。除以上谈到整个计划、供求问题外，国家的需要同学校的专业教育以及学生志愿，很难百分之百地一致。国家当前急切需要的人材十分缺乏的时候，让少数专业性质相近的学生改行补充，仍是十分必要的。因此，在这个意义上，专家们认为政府提的“在国家需要的基础上贯彻学用一致”方针是合理的，不过在执行中过分强调国家需要，而抹杀学生专业知识，则是不妥当的。
    对学生的志愿，专家们认为有的虽然值得同情，但同实际要求矛盾很大，不容易解决。例如医科毕业生，从理论上说，一般应先分配在城市较大医院工作，让有经验的医生带两三年，然后派到远离城市的地区的卫生所或门诊部工作，这样比较合适。一个新毕业生要一下子把内科、外科、小儿科、妇产科等等一塌括子包下来是很困难的，必须有相当经验的医生才能担当这个任务。但在目前内地省份、边远地区、工矿企业需人迫切的情况下，只有要求学生多从国家需要出发来考虑自己的工作问题。至于不愿到实际生产单位，愿意留在科学单位和高等学校，这要根据每个人的具体情况加以分析，如有很好的理论基础又有研究才能的学生，应当尊重他们的志愿。不过，这类问题属于思想认识问题的较多。他们主要是对向科学进军的意义理解过分狭隘，认为只有在科学机关、高等学校才可以提高理论，忽略了在实践中研究提高的重要意义。
    闹思想问题的学生是少数，教育家们认为对他们应进行说服教育。个别学生无理取闹的不应同情。像去年山东农学院一对夫妇毕业生，原分配到安徽省，不在一个地区工作，他们要求调整。有关部门协商后调到同一单位工作，他们又要求在同一办公室工作，调到一个办公室工作后，他们还是不干。类似这种情况的学生也还有一些。今年应届毕业生中，已经提出“放弃东北”的口号，工科毕业生不愿到东北去工作，这不论从国家要求和他们本人的发展来说，都是不对的。因此，专家们批评政府不应对他们过分迁就。
        一些值得研究的作法
    许多教授反映，目前高等学校毕业生分配工作过分集中，统得太死，分配方法贯彻民主精神不够，从分配到调派贯彻群众路线不够，这也是造成分配不当使学生学用不一致的主要原因之一。现在制订调配方案，都没有很好地走“生产者”和“消费者”的群众线路，既不征求熟悉学生专业和特长的教授的意见，也很少了解用人单位的具体需要，而方案一经制定公布，更改就很困难。教授们特别反对留助教也不征求他们的意见，把一些业务水平较差不适宜作助教的学生，硬分配到教研室作助教，造成教学上很大困难。有的教授说：教师辛辛苦苦培养了几年，对学生很了解，但对他们的工作没有发言权。许多学生分配到不适合的工作岗位以后写信向他们的老师诉苦，教授们也表示爱莫能助。每年6月底7月初，学生就毕了业。在毕业前后，各学校往往集中进行思想教育工作，动员学生服从分配，大会小会连续举行，但很少征求教师和学生意见，学生们在这种动员教育空气中，有意见也不敢提。学校人事部门又把分配工作神秘化起来，一切保密，并且采取简单的作法，有些学校上午开大会宣布名单，中午欢送，下午学生就上火车，有的学生甚至上了火车还不知道被分配到那个单位干什么工作。所以好多学生到了工作岗位只是“组织服从，思想不通”。
    教授们提出，关于专业人材的培养计划、培养、分配和使用分作几个头来领导也有问题，特别是计划、培养、分配部门不能很好掌握用人部门的需要和他们使用毕业生的情况，毕业生分配工作就很难作好。而且几个头的领导，一个环节发生问题就牵动全局，每年的分配方案迟迟订不下来就是一个例子。负责分配的国家经济委员会缺少用人部门资料订不下方案，负责调派的高等教育部没有方案只能让学生等着。学生发生分配不当的问题，又由国务院人事局负责调整。这些部门如何统一领导互相配合，还值得研究。
    最近已经有不少教授，包括一些学校负责人在内，提出在高等学校毕业生分配工作上开辟“自由市场”的问题，他们主张留一个口，让一部分学生可以自由就业。政府对学生的工作仍负责分配，学生如果不接受政府分配的工作，可以让他们自找职业。有些部门也可以自由招聘。已经分配到工作岗位上的学生如认为工作不合适，也可以自找职业。教授们普遍要求在毕业生分配工作中扩大民主，走群众路线，改变过去学校人事部门包办的局面。学校分配委员会要吸收有关教授参加，分配委员会要真正成为有职有权的机构，发动教师、学生讨论，并且让学校同用人单位直接通气，共同研究学生的分配使用问题。今年应届毕业生快要结束他们的学业了，教授们希望分配方案早日确定下来，切实改进分配工作。
