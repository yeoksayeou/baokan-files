　　The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on June 26, denouncing the American plot to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. Following this, our government also issued a statement on June 27, strongly protesting the illegal act of the United States in unilaterally abolishing Item 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, a serious violation of the agreement. In its statement, our government solemnly declared that our government and people will never agree to this illegal act by the United States. At the same time, our government expressed its full support for the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the convening of a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean situation.
　　Our government's solemn statement expresses the firm will of our 600 million people to safeguard peace in Korea. We remember very clearly how, seven years ago at this time, the United States launched a war of aggression in Korea. How we, the Chinese people, with anger, threw ourselves into the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, support the Korean people, and safeguard peace in Asia. The Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, together with the Korean people, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, went through more than three years of arduous struggle before winning the victory of realizing the Korean armistice and extinguishing the flames of war ignited by the United States in Korea. The Korean Armistice Agreement was won with the blood of the peoples of China and Korea, and with the persistent efforts of peace-loving people all over the world. We will never allow the United States to arbitrarily abolish any part of it, never allow the United States to use the means of undermining the armistice agreement to undermine the stability of the Korean armistice, and never allow the American conspiracy to sabotage peace in Korea and Asia to succeed.
　　Since the realization of the Korean armistice, the United States, whether in the bilateral political talks held shortly after the armistice or at the Geneva Conference discussing the Korean issue, has tried its best to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, the United States has continuously violated the armistice agreement and obstructed its thorough implementation. This shows that the purpose of the United States is to maintain the current state of division in Korea and to make Korea one of the sources of constantly creating tension in the Far East. The United States is now openly violating Item 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting new weapons into South Korea, and preparing to turn South Korea into an American military base. Its purpose is to deepen the division of Korea and threaten peace in Korea and Asia.
　　In order to thwart this American conspiracy to undermine peace in Korea and Asia and eliminate the root cause of the tension created by the United States, it is necessary to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to promptly convene an international conference with the participation of relevant countries to ensure the continued validity and implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to further seek ways to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. All those who truly care about peace in Korea and Asia cannot but support this proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
　　The Korean armistice must be stabilized, the armistice agreement must not be violated, and the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, we, the Chinese people, will continue to stand with the Korean people and fight to smash any American conspiracy to undermine peace.

### 不许美国破坏和平的阴谋得逞

　　不许美国破坏和平的阴谋得逞
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在6月26日发表声明，痛斥美方策划破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋。接着，我国政府也在6月27日发表声明，强烈抗议美国片面废除朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项这一严重破坏协定的非法行为。我国政府在声明中严正宣告，我国政府和人民决不同意美国这一非法行为。同时，我国政府表示完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所提出的关于召开有关国家会议讨论朝鲜局势的建议。
    我国政府的严正声明，表达了我们全国六亿人民维护朝鲜和平的坚决意志。我们还记得很清楚，七年前的这个时候，美国在朝鲜发动了侵略战争。我们中国人民当时怎样以愤怒的心情，为了保家卫国、支援朝鲜人民、维护亚洲和平，投入了抗美援朝的斗争。中国人民的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民在一起，在全世界爱好和平的人民支持下，经过三年多艰苦战斗，才取得了实现朝鲜停战的胜利，扑灭了美国在朝鲜燃起的战争火焰。朝鲜停战协定是朝中两国人民用鲜血争取得来的，是全世界爱好和平的人民用他们坚持不懈的努力争取得来的。我们决不允许美国任意废除其中任何一条，决不容许美国用破坏停战协定的手段来破坏朝鲜停战的稳定，决不容许美国破坏朝鲜和亚洲的和平的阴谋得逞。
    从朝鲜停战实现以来，美国无论在停战以后不久举行的双方政治会谈中，无论在讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议上，都竭力阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。同时，美国又不断破坏停战协定，阻挠停战协定的彻底实施。这说明美国的目的是要保持朝鲜目前的分裂局面，并使朝鲜成为美国在远东不断制造的紧张局势的策源地之一。美国现在公然破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项，把新式武器运进南朝鲜，准备把南朝鲜变成美国的军事基地，其目的就是要加深朝鲜的分裂，威胁朝鲜和亚洲的和平。
    为了粉碎美国这个破坏朝鲜和亚洲和平的阴谋，消除美国制造紧张局势的根源，就必须使朝鲜问题能够得到和平解决。因此，迅速召开有关国家参加的国际会议，以保证朝鲜停战协定的继续有效和实施，和进一步谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的途径，是完全必要的。一切真正关心朝鲜和亚洲和平的人，都不能不支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的这个建议。
    朝鲜停战必须稳定，停战协定不容许破坏，朝鲜问题必须早日获得和平解决。为了亚洲和世界的和平，我们中国人民将继续同朝鲜人民在一起，为粉碎美国的任何破坏和平的阴谋而斗争。
