Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: Two world-renowned Soviet iron and steel industrial enterprises—the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works and the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works—will be further expanded during the next two five-year plans (1956-1965) to meet the requirements of the rapid growth of the steel industry.

As part of the overall rapid development plan of the Soviet steel industry, the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Urals plans to double its steel production by 1965. To this end, in recent years, it will add two giant blast furnaces with a volume of 2,300 cubic meters each. In the open-hearth workshop, the number of open-hearth furnaces will increase from the current twenty-eight to thirty-seven in 1965. The working capacity of various rolling mills will increase by 20% to 70%. The factory's raw material base will also be expanded. The production capacity of the concentrating plant and sintering plant of the existing Magnit Mountain iron ore base will be tripled. In addition, the newly discovered Sokolovsk, Karbay, and Kachar iron ore deposits in Kazakhstan will also become its main raw material bases. The factory's coke ovens will increase from the current ten to sixteen. The entire ore dressing and coking process will be automated. In order to adapt to the development of production, the power generation capacity of the factory's power station will be doubled, the number of workers will increase by about one-third, and 17,000 houses will be built in the city of Magnitogorsk for the factory's workers.

The Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works, the steel industrial center of Siberia, will increase its annual pig iron production by 76% and its annual steel and steel product production by 34% by the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The raw material and fuel base of this integrated plant is planned to be further expanded, and a number of new mines and open-pit mines will be built in the Shoria and Abakan mining areas. The factory's existing workshops and equipment will be renovated and expanded, and two more huge coke ovens, a blast furnace with a volume of more than 1,500 cubic meters, a blooming mill, and a special steel factory will be built. In addition, a large oxygen station will be built to enable all blast furnaces in the enterprise to use oxygen-enriched blast for ironmaking.

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: According to TASS reports, due to the continuous discovery of new coal deposits, the area of the Donbass coalfield, a famous coal-producing area in the Soviet Union, has more than doubled compared with the original.

Donbass is one of the oldest and most productive coal areas in the Soviet Union, and its current coal production accounts for one-third of the country's total coal production. After extensive geological exploration, many rich coal deposits have recently been discovered in the east, southeast, and west of this coal area. In the West Donbass, near the Dnieper River, forty-five deposits have been discovered, with a total coal reserve of 8 billion to 10 billion tons. About 150 coal mines can be built in these new coal mine areas. Among them, the first mine with an annual output of about one million tons of coal has been completed.

The coal in West Donbass is very suitable for coking, and it is close to the steel industrial area of Ukraine. Therefore, the discovery of these new coal mines will greatly promote the development of the Ukrainian steel industry.

In the southern Donbass, in the 400-kilometer area south of Stalino to the Sea of Azov, eleven new coal mine deposits have been discovered, with coal seams ranging from half a meter to one and a half meters thick in each deposit. It is estimated that the coal reserves in some areas of the new coal mining area alone are 1.5 billion tons.

The boundary of Donbass has also been pushed many kilometers north from the old mining area. A number of new coal mine deposits have been discovered north of Voroshilovgrad.

    适应钢铁工业迅速增长要求
    苏联将扩建两个钢铁联合工厂
    顿巴斯发现储量丰富的煤矿床煤田面积扩大一倍多
    新华社莫斯科1日电　世界闻名的两个苏联钢铁工业企业——马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂和库兹涅茨克钢铁联合工厂，在最近两个五年计划期间（1956—1965年）将进一步扩大。
    作为整个苏联钢铁工业迅速发展计划的一部分，乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂计划到1965年把钢铁产量增加为现在的两倍。为此，在最近几年间，它将增建两座容积各为两千三百立方公尺的巨型高炉。在平炉车间里，平炉将从现在的二十八座增加为1965年的三十七座。各种轧钢机的工作能力将提高20％到70％。工厂的原料基地也将扩大。现有的铁矿基地马格尼特矿山的选矿厂和烧结厂的生产能力将增加三倍。此外，哈萨克新发现的索科洛夫斯克、卡尔巴伊和卡查尔铁矿也将成为它的主要原料基地。工厂的炼焦炉将从现有的十座增加到十六座。整个选矿和炼焦的过程都将实行自动化。为了适应生产的发展，工厂的发电站的发电能力将增加一倍，工人人数大约要增加三分之一，在马格尼托哥尔斯克城将为这家工厂的工人建筑一万七千幢住宅。
    西伯利亚的钢铁工业中心库兹涅茨克钢铁联合工厂在第七个五年计划结束的时候，将把生铁的年产量增加76％，钢和钢材的年产量各增加34％。这个联合工厂的原料和燃料基地计划进一步扩大，在绍里亚和阿巴干矿区将建设许多新的矿井和露天矿场。工厂现有的车间和设备将要改建和扩大，准备再建设两座非常巨大的炼焦炉、一座容积为一千五百多立方公尺的高炉、一个初轧车间和一个制造特种钢的工厂。此外，还将建成一座大氧气站，以便使企业的所有高炉都采用富氧鼓风法来炼铁。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社报道：由于不断发现新的煤矿矿床，苏联著名的产煤区顿巴斯煤田的面积已经比原先扩大了一倍多。
    顿巴斯是苏联历史最久也是产量最多的煤区之一，它目前出产的煤占全国产煤总量的三分之一。经过广泛的地质勘探后，最近时期又在这个煤区的东部、东南部和西部发现了许多储量丰富的煤矿床。在靠近第聂伯河的西顿巴斯，已经发现了四十五个矿床，总储煤量达八十亿到一百亿吨。在这些新煤矿地区，大约可以建设一百五十个煤井。其中，第一个年产约一百万吨煤的矿井已经建成。
    西顿巴斯的煤很适于炼焦用，而这里又接近乌克兰的钢铁工业区。因此，这些新煤矿的发现将大大促进乌克兰钢铁工业的发展。
    在顿巴斯南部，斯大林诺以南到亚速海之间四百公里的地区内，已经发现了十一个新煤矿矿床，各矿床的煤层厚达半公尺到一公尺半。据估计，单是在新煤矿区的部分地区，储煤量就有十五亿吨。
    顿巴斯的界线也从老开采区向北推进了许多公里。在伏罗希洛夫格勒以北，已经发现了不少新煤矿矿床。
