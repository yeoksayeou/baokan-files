Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch The National Design Conference, which opened in Beijing on May 31st, closed today.

	The convening of this design conference is an important step in compiling the Second Five-Year Plan. The purpose of the conference was to mobilize 100,000 designers nationwide to examine and summarize the design work during the First Five-Year Plan with the spirit of rectification, learn from the experience and lessons, so as to better implement the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work in the Second Five-Year Plan, and gradually realize China's socialist industrialization.

	More than 900 people attended the meeting, including heads and chief engineers or engineers from more than 100 design institutes (companies) across the country, famous Chinese architects, and responsible cadres from various central economic construction departments.
	This meeting was jointly convened by the State Construction Commission, the State Planning Commission, and State Economic Commission.
	During the meeting, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo, delivered reports to the conference.
	In his report, Li Fuchun first summarized the great achievements and certain shortcomings and errors of China's First Five-Year Plan. He said that the main problem now is how to summarize the experiences and lessons, and correctly implement the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work in future capital construction work. Li Fuchun said that the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work is put forward based on China's specific historical conditions and actual situation, and it is a long-term strategic policy. If this policy is well implemented, it can reduce and help deal with the contradictions among the people; if it is not well implemented, it will expand the contradictions among the people.
	Next, Li Fuchun analyzed the main situation of China's current economic life, and put forward several main problems to be solved correctly in compiling the Second Five-Year Plan, these problems are the distribution of accumulation and consumption in the national income, the proportional relationship of the national economy and the distribution of investment, the economic management system, the specific policies and saving measures in capital construction and design. Li Fuchun put forward some principled opinions on how to solve these problems for the participants to consider.
	Li Fuchun pointed out several policy issues in capital construction and design work. He made detailed reports on the policies of enterprise scale, design standards, the level of technical equipment, striving for domestic design and domestic manufacturing equipment, industrial layout and cooperation, urban planning, and civil construction issues.
	Li Fuchun elaborated on the issue of practicing strict economy and reducing the cost of capital construction projects. He said that if efforts are made to reduce the cost of projects from all aspects, it is initially estimated that, under the condition of ensuring quality, compared with the First Five-Year Plan, the construction of the same production capacity projects in industrial construction can use 20% to 30% less investment, and the average cost of civil construction across the country may also be reduced by about 30%. Li Fuchun also used many examples to illustrate the possibility of this saving, and also proposed some measures to reduce the cost of projects.
	The last part of Li Fuchun's speech was about learning the skills of building the country through thrift and hard work in connection with rectification. He said that all the shortcomings and errors in our past capital construction work, some are certainly due to our lack of experience, and some are inseparable from the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in our work. After Li Fuchun talked about the fact that the leadership should be responsible for the past waste, he said that he hoped that in this design conference and after the conference, all designers will be mobilized to expose the shortcomings and errors in the leadership's work with the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything," and put forward suggestions for improving the work to help the leadership rectify.
	Two days before the end of the meeting, Bo Yibo made a report to the conference.
	Bo Yibo first talked about the estimation of the construction work in recent years. He said that the achievements are fundamental and major. He said that some people criticize the Communists for always saying that the achievements are the main thing when summarizing work, which is cliché. However, he said that he still can't find other words to replace this sentence, because it is not in line with the facts if he doesn't say so. He cited the fact that many of the 156 projects that the Soviet Union helped China build have been put into production or will be put into production, and also talked about his recent inspection of the Northwest and Southwest with Vice Premier Li Fuchun, where he saw some important factories that were even better than what he saw in the Soviet Union. He said that this cannot be called construction achievements; with such great achievements, one cannot say that the achievements are fundamental and major. Denying these achievements is denying the results of the hard work of the people across the country.
	Bo Yibo then talked about the most basic shortcomings in the construction in recent years. He said that some aspects of construction are not fully adapted to China's current situation. He said that there has been too much non-productive construction, and the standards are also higher. For example, can we reduce the number of large auditoriums and theaters? Can we reduce the number of floodlit stadiums? However, he said, he also wanted to say a "doctrinaire" sentence, these shortcomings are unavoidable in many ways. Because our country is in a process of great development and great change, carrying out such great construction, everyone lacks experience, can anyone be so omnipotent and guarantee that he will not have some shortcomings in his work? The problem is that these shortcomings must be overcome and the work must be actively improved, and not to use these shortcomings to do other things. That kind of criticism with ulterior motives is of no benefit to the people's cause.
	Bo Yibo also talked about construction policies, urban planning, cooperation and coordination, and revising various standard quotas.
	When Bo Yibo talked about learning from the Soviet Union, he said that it is completely correct to learn from the Soviet Union. For many engineering designs, we can now do it ourselves. When we visit factories, we can now also offer two relatively pertinent opinions. These are all the results of learning from the Soviet Union.
	Finally, Bo Yibo encouraged everyone to learn the skills of building the country through thrift and hard work, and consider problems based on China's characteristics—poor (economic backwardness), many (large population), and few (little arable land).
	During the meeting, the representatives discussed the reports of the two vice premiers in groups. Many designers gave speeches at the conference or expressed their opinions in written form. In their speeches, they exchanged the experience of saving in capital construction and design work, and put forward some important suggestions for saving. Everyone believed that it is entirely possible to reduce the cost of industrial buildings or civil buildings by 20% to 30% in the Second Five-Year Plan compared with the First Five-Year Plan.
	The personnel from various places who participated in the meeting criticized the leadership of the three committees that lead the national economy and the leadership work of the central ministries. They criticized the central organs for solving problems slowly and procrastinatingly, "there are more people shaking their heads and fewer people nodding their heads." The central leading organs set the standards, quotas and regulations for construction too rigidly and managed too much, and local areas could not adapt to local conditions and circumstances, which affected the enthusiasm of the local areas. Some people also criticized the weak technical leadership of the leading organs, and they often did not consult with experts very well, so that when deciding on technical issues, they vacillated and delayed the time. Many designers who participated in the meeting believed that the cooperation and coordination between the central government and the local government or between the central ministries in construction work was not good, and they often "passed the buck." This problem was so serious that some people suggested that the central ministries designate special agencies and it would be best to have a vice premier specifically responsible for handling cooperation or "passing the buck" issues.
	At the end of the meeting, Wang Heshou, director of the State Construction Commission, answered the questions raised during the meeting.

    编制第二个五年计划的重要步骤
    全国设计会议贯彻勤俭建国方针
    动员全国十万设计人员用整风精神总结工作经验
    李富春、薄一波两位副总理号召学会勤俭建国本领
    新华社7日讯　5月31日在北京召开的全国设计会议今天闭幕。
    这次设计会议的召开是编制第二个五年计划的重要步骤。会议的目的是为了动员全国十万设计人员用整风的精神，来检查和总结第一个五年计划期间的设计工作，从中吸取经验教训，以便于在第二个五年计划中更好地贯彻勤俭建国的方针，逐步实现我国社会主义工业化。
    参加会议的有全国一百多个设计院（公司）的负责人和总工程师或工程师，中国著名的建筑学家和中央各经济建设部门的负责干部等九百多人。
    这个会议是国家建设委员会、国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会联合召开的。
    会议期间，国务院副总理李富春和薄一波向大会作了报告。
    李富春在报告中首先综述了我国第一个五年计划取得的伟大成就和某些缺点和错误。他说，现在的主要问题是如何总结经验教训，在今后的基本建设工作中，正确地贯彻勤俭建国的方针。李富春说，勤俭建国的方针是根据我国具体的历史条件和实际情况提出的，是一个长期的带有战略性的方针。这一方针贯彻得好，就可以减少和有助于处理人民内部的矛盾，贯彻得不好，就会扩大人民内部的矛盾。
    接着，李富春分析了我国当前经济生活的主要情况，并提出编好第二个五年计划要正确地解决的几个主要问题，这些问题是国民收入中的积累和消费的分配，国民经济的比例关系和投资的分配，经济管理的体制，基本建设和设计当中的具体政策和节约措施。李富春就如何解决这些问题提出了一些原则性的意见请与会者考虑。
    李富春指出了基本建设和设计工作中的几个政策问题。他就企业的规模、设计标准、技术装备的水平、争取本国设计和国内制造设备、工业布置和协作、城市规划和民用建筑问题的政策，作了详细的报告。
    李富春阐述了厉行节约降低基本建设工程造价问题。他说，如果从各方面努力降低工程造价，初步估算，在保证质量的条件下第二个五年计划同第一个五年计划比较，工业建设方面建设同等生产能力的工程可以少用20％到30％的投资，全国民用建筑平均造价也可能降低30％左右，李富春并用很多事例说明了这种节约的可能性，而且还提出了一些降低工程造价的措施。
    李富春讲的最后一部分是关于结合整风学会勤俭建国的本领的问题。他说，我们过去在基本建设工作中的一切缺点和错误，有些固然是由于我们没有经验，有些是和我们工作中的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义分不开的。李富春谈到过去浪费主要应由领导方面负责以后说，他希望在这次设计会议上和会议以后，动员全体设计人员，本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，揭发领导工作中的缺点和错误，提出改进工作的意见，帮助领导方面整风。
    会议结束的前两天，薄一波向大会作了报告。
    薄一波首先讲到对几年来建设工作的估计。他说，成绩是基本的，主要的。他说，有些人批评共产党人总结工作时总是说成绩是主要的，这是八股。但是，他说他还找不出别的词句来代替这句话，因为不这样说就不符合事实。他举出苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项工程有很多已经投入生产或将要投入生产的事实，又讲到他最近和李富春副总理到西北、西南等地视察时看到有些重要的工厂，比他在苏联看到的还好。他说，这不能不叫做建设的成绩；有了这样巨大的成绩，不能不说成绩是基本的主要的。否认这些成绩，就是否认全国劳动人民的辛勤劳动的结果。
    薄一波接着谈到这几年建设中最基本的缺点。他说，有些方面的建设同我国的现状不完全适应。他说，非生产性的建设搞多了，标准也高了些。例如说，大礼堂、剧院是不是可以减少一些呢？灯光球场是不是可以减少一些呢？但是，他说，他还要说一句“教条主义”的话，这些缺点有许多是难免的。因为我们国家正处在大发展、大变革的过程中，进行这样伟大的建设，大家都缺少经验，难道有人能够这样神通广大，保证他做起工作来不发生这样或那样的一些缺点吗？问题是在必须克服这些缺点，积极改进工作，而不在于利用这些缺点来做别的文章。那种醉翁之意不在酒的批评，对于人民的事业是毫无益处的。
    薄一波还讲了建设方针、城市规划、协作配合、修定各种标准定额问题。
    薄一波谈到学习苏联的时候说，向苏联学习是完全正确的。有许多工程设计，现在已经可以自己动手了，到工厂参观，我们现在也可以提两条比较中肯的意见了。这些都是学习苏联的结果。
    最后，薄一波勉励大家要学会勤俭建国的本领，根据中国的特点——穷（经济落后）、多（人口多）、少（耕地少）三个字来考虑问题。
    会议期间，代表们分组讨论了两位副总理的报告。很多设计人员在大会上发言或用书面形式发表了意见，他们在发言中交流了基本建设和设计工作中节约的经验，并且提出了一些重要的节约的建议。大家认为不论工业建筑或民用建筑的造价，第二个五年计划比第一个五年计划降低20％到30％是完全可能的。
    各地参加会议的人员对领导国家经济工作的三个委员会和中央各部的领导工作提出了批评。他们批评中央机关解决问题迟缓拖沓，“摇头的人多，点头的人少”。中央领导机关对建设方面的标准、定额和规章等定得太死，管得太多，地方上不能因地因事制宜，影响了地方积极性。有些人还批评领导机关的技术领导薄弱，又往往不很好地同专家们商量，以致在决定带技术性的问题时，摇摆不定，延长时间。参加会议的不少设计人员认为中央与地方之间或中央各部之间在建设工作中协作配合得不好，经常“扯皮”。这一问题严重到有人提议中央各部指定专门机构并且最好有一位副总理专责处理协作或“扯皮”问题。
    会议结束时，国家建设委员会主任王鹤寿就会议期间提出的问题作了解答。
