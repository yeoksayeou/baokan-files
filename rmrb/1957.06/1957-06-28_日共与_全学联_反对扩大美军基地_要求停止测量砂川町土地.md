Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party demanded on June 26th that the Japanese government cease surveying land belonging to residents of Sunagawa Town, Tokyo, for the purpose of expanding the US Tachikawa Air Base.

On the same day, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations (Zengakuren) also dispatched twenty representatives to protest to the Tokyo Procurement Bureau, which was preparing to survey the land of Sunagawa Town residents. The Federation stated in its letter of protest: Because we oppose any conspiracy to turn Japan into a nuclear weapons launch base, we protest the expansion of the US military base.

The Japanese government has announced that it will formally survey approximately thirteen acres of land belonging to residents of Sunagawa Town from July 8th in order to expand the US air base.

Residents of Sunagawa Town, workers, and students have gathered to resolutely oppose the government's land surveying. Under these circumstances, government authorities had to announce a one-day delay in the preliminary surveying work originally scheduled to begin on June 25th.

This morning, the government's survey team secretly began preliminary surveying of some land that had already been fenced off by the US military base authorities with barbed wire. After local residents discovered this, they demanded that the survey team "go back!" and threw stones at the surveyors. However, approximately twenty US military police blocked residents from entering the barbed wire fence to drive away the survey team and injured three students.

Three Socialist Party Diet members and seven residents' representatives protested to the Procurement Bureau today against the forced surveying of land. They also protested to the US military authorities at Tachikawa Air Base against the US military police's conspiracy to use tear gas to obstruct the Japanese people's opposition to the government's land surveying.

　　日共与“全学联”反对扩大美军基地
    要求停止测量砂川町土地
    新华社27日讯  东京消息：日本共产党6月26日要求日本政府停止测量东京砂川町居民的土地来扩大美国立川空军基地。
    同一天，全日本学生自治会总联合会也派了二十位代表向准备测量砂川町居民土地的东京调达厅提出抗议。总联合会在抗议书中说，由于我们反对任何企图把日本变成核武器发射基地的阴谋，所以我们抗议扩大美国军事基地。
    日本政府已经宣布要从7月8日正式测量砂川町居民的约十三英亩土地，来扩大美国的空军基地。
    砂川町居民和工人、学生已经集合起来，准备坚决反对政府测量土地。在这种情况下，政府当局不得不宣布把原订从6月25日开始的初步测量工作延迟一天进行。
    今天一清早，政府的测量队偷偷地开始初步测量一些土地，这些土地过去已经被美军基地当局用铁丝网圈占起来。当地居民等发现后，要求测量队“滚回去！”，并且扔石头打测量队员。但是约二十名美国宪兵阻挠居民们进入铁丝网去赶走测量队。并且，打伤了三个学生。
    三名社会党国会议员和七位居民代表今天抗议调达厅强行测量土地。他们并且向立川空军基地的美军当局提出抗议，反对美国宪兵阴谋使用催泪瓦斯来阻挠日本人民反对政府测量土地。
