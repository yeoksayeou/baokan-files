Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The China Political Science and Law Association continued to hold symposiums with legal professionals on the afternoons of May 31 and June 4.

    At the symposium on the afternoon of May 31, Professor Rui Mu of Peking University spoke about legislative issues. Rui Mu believes that there are already many laws, but the major laws are incomplete, the pace of legislation is somewhat slow, and the legislative work is somewhat chaotic. He said that many important regulations and legal documents are drafted by the ministries and commissions under the State Council and implemented as internal instructions, without a central body to manage them uniformly. He suggested that the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council should take on this task uniformly.

    Rui Mu believes that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people have been basically satisfied with judicial work. However, at present, the judicial organs only handle civil disputes, while disputes between various institutions in socialist construction are often handled by themselves. He suggested establishing arbitration offices to handle problems arising between various economic institutions in socialist construction.

    Lei Jieqiong proposes four ways out for old lawyers
    Lei Jieqiong, Dean of Studies at Beijing College of Political Science and Law, spoke about the arrangement of political and legal talents. Regarding the arrangement of old lawyers, she put forward the following four ways out: First, participate in the work of legal advisory offices as freelancers; second, serve as corporate legal counsel; third, organize them to translate classical bourgeois legal works; fourth, organize them to conduct research work, such as the history of Chinese legal system. Lei Jieqiong also believes that legal science lags behind other sciences. She said that it is dangerous for some people not to acknowledge and be content with this fact.

    Tan Tiwu, a director of the Political Science and Law Association, talked about the issue of housing renovation in Shanghai in her speech. She said that a housing survey material once stated that the main contradiction of the housing shortage in Shanghai was the issue of ownership. Based on her inspection in Shanghai, the main contradiction of the housing shortage in Shanghai was not the issue of ownership, but the problem of supply falling short of demand.

    She said that Shanghai is now taking the road of joint state-private ownership for housing renovation. Among the houses that have already been jointly operated, some are commercial in nature, which can be jointly operated, but some are the houses of small landlords, which are also jointly operated. After the joint operation, the state has to pay fixed interest, be responsible for repairing the houses, and arrange jobs for the small landlords. She said that it is worth considering whether to take the road of joint state-private ownership for renovating houses.

    Yang Yuqing said: Everything originates in Beijing, and chaos starts from Beijing. Senior cadres in Beijing have to get off their sedan chairs, and some even have to step down.

    Yang Yuqing, deputy editor-in-chief of "Political Science and Law Research," called this rectification movement a "getting off the sedan chair" movement. He said that some Communist Party members are riding in sedan chairs, divorced from the masses. What kind of people have been cultivated in the past eight years? He believes that they are cultivating people who carry sedan chairs. He said that even now, some people are unwilling to get off the sedan chairs, and those who carry the sedan chairs are unwilling to let go of the poles.

    Yang Yuqing said that some people say, "Senior cadres are too good, middle-level cadres are too few, and lower-level cadres are messing things up." He opposed this statement. He emphasized: "Everything originates in Beijing, and chaos starts from Beijing."

    He said that first of all, the senior cadres in Beijing have to get off the sedan chairs. He believes that they should not only get off the sedan chairs, but some even have to step down.

    Yang Yuqing also said that some of the people who did judicial work in the past should have been killed, and some should have been imprisoned, but he believes that some should not have been killed, and some should not have been imprisoned. He also said that some were killed, some were imprisoned, while others who studied old law became ministers and directors. He said that these people should step down, and it is not enough to appease the people's anger if they do not step down. There is also a type of person who should especially step down. The editor-in-chief of the People's Daily must step down because the People's Daily has been singing praises for the past few years and wants to "收" (shōu, tighten up) instead of "放" (fàng, let go) in this movement.

    Yang Yuqing continued, saying that the pens of intellectuals are naturally anti-status quo. True intellectuals are anti-status quo. Since ancient times, good articles have been anti-status quo. Yang Yuqing advocated opposing the status quo and advocated being so-called "benevolent and righteous people." He said that people who sing praises are not praised. Yang Yuqing believes that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" should not only broaden the channels of speech, but also "broaden the channels of talent." He said that many people not only can speak, but also can do things. Today, whoever has the ability should do the job. But some capable people are often kicked aside on the pretext that certain conditions are not met. Today, this barrier must be broken.

    Xie Huaishi opposes the view of replacing law with policy
    At the symposium on the afternoon of the 4th, Xie Huaishi, a teacher at the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres, talked about the legislative work since the founding of the country. He said that the reason why the laws are not complete is that there are problems in the ideological viewpoint. In the past, a view of replacing law with policy was popular, believing that there was no need for law once there was policy. Later, there was a constitution, and they were satisfied with the constitution, using the constitution to replace all laws.

    Xie Huaishi said that some people believe that it is a matter of course that our laws were incomplete in the past, and it is not harmful, believing that it is not surprising that there is no civil law or criminal law. He expressed his opposition to this view, believing that this is the wrong view of replacing law with policy.

    Wang Tieya, a professor in the Law Department of Peking University, said that international law science in China has been interrupted for seven years. This is the result of taking a completely negative attitude towards legal science, and therefore, international law is also negated on this basis of negation. The teaching talents in this area have been scattered, and most of the talents have either changed careers or are sitting on the sidelines. He said that there were not many talents teaching international law in old China, so the training of cadres has been interrupted, and it is very difficult to restore it now. He requested that the disasters left by sectarianism be corrected quickly and the crisis in international law teaching be salvaged.

    In his speech, Wang Tieya also appealed for international private law, the sister science of international law. He said that this science is facing a great crisis and is on the verge of extinction. He requested that relevant departments break down departmentalism and allow talents in this area to return to their original positions.

    Legal professionals Lu Junkai, Hong Dingzhong, Wang Jixin, Gong Xiangrui, Wen Hongjun, and Zhang Yingnan also spoke at these two symposiums.

    法学界人士批评立法工作缓慢
    本报特约新华社专稿　中国政治法律学会在5月31日和6月4日两天的下午继续举行法学界人士座谈会。
    在5月31日下午的座谈会上，北京大学教授芮沐谈到了立法问题。芮沐认为现在已经有了不少法律，但主要法律不完备，立法的速度走得缓慢一些，立法工作也有些乱。他说，许多重要法规和法律性的文件是由国务院以下的各部、会自己拟订，作为内部指示执行，没有一个总的机构来统一管理。他建议国务院法制局应统一担负起这个任务。
    芮沐认为，中华人民共和国成立后，人民群众对司法工作基本上是满意的。但是，现在司法机关只管民事纠纷，而社会主义建设中各个机构之间的纠纷往往由自己处理。他建议成立公断处来处理社会主义建设中各个经济机构之间发生的问题。
    雷洁琼提出安排旧律师的四条出路
    北京政法学院教务长雷洁琼谈到了对政法人材的安排问题，关于安排旧律师的问题，她提出以下四条出路：一、作为自由职业者参加法律顾问处的工作；二、担任企业法律顾问；三、组织他们翻译资产阶级古典法学著作；四、组织他们进行研究工作，如中国法制史。雷洁琼还认为法律科学落后于其他科学，她说，有的人不承认和安于这个事实是危险的。
    政法学会理事谭惕吾在发言中谈到了上海房屋改造问题。她说，有一份房屋调查材料曾说上海房荒的主要矛盾是所有制问题，根据她在上海的视察，上海房荒的主要矛盾不是所有制问题，而是供不应求的问题。
    她说，现在上海对房屋改造是走公私合营的道路。在已合营的房屋中，一部分是商业性质的，这可以公私合营，但有一部分是小业主的房屋，也被公私合营。合营以后，国家要付定息，要负责修缮房屋，还要安排小业主的工作。她说，改造房屋也走公私合营的道路是值得考虑的。
    杨玉清说：一切发源于北京，乱搞就从北京乱搞起。在北京的上级干部要下轿，有的还要下台。
    “政法研究”副总编辑杨玉清把这次整风运动叫作“下轿”运动。他说，有些共产党员坐轿子，脱离群众。八年来培养的是什么人呢？他认为培养的是抬轿子的人。他说，至今还有人不愿下轿子，那些抬轿的人也还不愿放轿杆。
    杨玉清说，有人说“上级干部太好，中级干部太少，下级干部乱搞”。他反对这种说法，他强调说：“一切发源于北京，乱搞就从北京乱搞起。”
    他说，首先在北京的上级干部要下轿，他认为不但要下轿，有的还要下台。
    杨玉清又说，过去做司法工作的人，有的该杀，有的该关，但是他认为有的不该杀，有的不该关。他还说，有的杀了，有的关了，而另一些学旧法的人却做了部长、司长。他说，这些人应该下台，不下台不足以平民愤。还有一种人特别应该下台，人民日报总编辑非下台不可，因为人民日报几年来都在歌功颂德，这次运动想“收”不想“放”。
    杨玉清接着说，文人的笔杆天然是反现状的，真正的文人是反现状的，从古以来好文章都是反现状的。杨玉清鼓吹反对现状，鼓吹要做所谓“仁人志士”。他说，歌功颂德的人是不为人所称道的。杨玉清认为，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”不仅要广开言路，还要“广开贤路”。他说，许多人不是光讲话的，他也能干事，今天的事应该谁有本事谁来干。但有些能干事的人，往往被以某种条件不够为借口，被一脚踢开。今天就要打破这个关。
    谢怀栻反对用政策代替法律的观点
    在4日下午的座谈会上，中央政法干部学校教员谢怀栻谈到开国以来的立法工作，他说，法律之所以不完备，关键在于思想观点上有问题。过去流行一种以政策代法律的观点，认为有了政策就不需要法律。后来有了宪法，就满足于宪法，用宪法代替一切法律。
    谢怀栻说，有的人认为过去的时期我们的法律不完备是理所当然的事，没有害处，认为没有民法刑法不足为奇。他表示反对这种看法，认为这就是用政策代替法律的错误观点。
    北京大学法律系教授王铁崖说，国际法科学在中国已经中断了七年，这是由于对法律科学采取全盘否定的态度的结果，因此也就在这样否定的基础上否定了国际法。在这方面的教学人材被打散了，大多数人材有的改行，有的坐冷板凳。他说，在旧中国教国际法的人材本来不多，这样一来干部的培养也就中断了，现在要恢复起来很吃力。他要求赶快纠正宗派主义留下来的祸害，挽救国际法教学上的危机。
    王铁崖发言中，还为国际法的姊妹科学——国际私法呼吁。他说，这门科学面临着极大的危机，快到绝种的境地。他要求有关部门打破本位主义，使这方面的人材回到原来的工作岗位上来。
    在这两次座谈会上发言的还有法学界人士卢俊凯、洪鼎钟、王纪新、龚祥瑞、闻鸿钧、张映南等人。
