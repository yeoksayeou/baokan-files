　　"Letting Go," "Contending," and "Criticism"
　　Mao Dun
    Criticizing rightist elements and drawing a clear line between ourselves and them is precisely the indispensable "contending" within the great "letting go" and great "contending." It is not surprising that erroneous ideas that deviate from socialism emerge during the great "letting go" and great "contending"; criticizing these erroneous ideas is precisely to enable "contending" and "letting go" to develop more healthily.

    For more than a month, the ideological war waged by the rightist elements has been clever, but also despicable.

    They concentrated their firepower on attacking the activists, indiscriminately vilifying them as obsequious flatterers; this was an attempt to threaten the activists, isolate the Communist Party, and make the activists isolated among the masses.

    They took advantage of certain deviations in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and certain shortcomings in the wage and grade evaluation, distorting the facts with great fanfare and exaggerating the shortcomings.

    Originally, the Communist Party itself wanted to rectify its own sectarianism; the rightist elements took advantage of this loophole, exaggerated the facts, and attempted to lower the Party's prestige among the masses, shake the people's faith in socialism, and induce some intermediate elements with unclear understanding to join the fray.

    They used many tricks of "theories" and "suggestions." Finally, the truth was revealed, and they openly opposed the people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Opposing the people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party means regressing the country from the path of socialism. Where would it retreat to? Bourgeois parliamentary politics? If that is what they think, then they are truly daydreaming! If China were to abandon the leadership of the Communist Party and abolish the proletarian dictatorship, what would follow would never be bourgeois parliamentary politics, but would only invite the restoration of imperialist forces in China, invite the fate of a colony, and invite enslavement!

    The rightist elements are ideologically blocked on this point.

    Precisely because they are blocked on this point, they disregard their conscience, close their eyes, and refuse to acknowledge that our achievements in the past eight years are the main aspect, and they resent others saying that the achievements are the main aspect!

    The reason why they are blocked on this point, and why they are so reluctant to let go of bourgeois parliamentary politics, is because what occupies the depths of their souls is bourgeois ideology!

    Today's rightist problem is still a matter of internal contradictions among the people. All sides' criticism of the rightist elements still starts from the desire for unity. He Xiangning earnestly hopes that "rightist elements should not be content to be rightists for a long time, but should constantly transform themselves and improve themselves." Now is the time for rightist elements to honestly examine their own thoughts.

    On the ideological front, today is another round of struggle. Anti-socialist ideas have been exposed and criticized. However, bourgeois ideology will not disappear from people's minds as a result; ideological struggle is constant. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is to make ideological struggle lively and in-depth, and to prevent ideological struggle from committing the error of dogmatism; and the great "letting go" and great "contending" must be accompanied by great "criticism," precisely to resolutely implement and healthily develop "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"!

### “放”、“鸣”和“批判”

　　“放”、“鸣”和“批判”
　　茅盾
    批判右派分子，和右派分子划清界限，正是大“放”大“鸣”中必不可少的大“争”。大“放”大“鸣”中会出现离开社会主义的错误思想，并不为奇；批判错误思想，正是为了使得“鸣”和“放”更健全地发展。
    一个多月来，右派分子所进行的思想战，是巧妙的，然而也是卑鄙的。
    他们集中火力，打击积极分子，不分皂白地丑诋积极分子都是胁肩谄笑之徒；这是企图威胁积极分子，孤立共产党，并使积极分子在群众中间陷于孤立。
    他们利用肃反的某些偏差、评薪评级的某些缺点，气势汹汹地歪曲事实，夸大缺点。
    本来，共产党自己要整自己的宗派主义；右派分子钻这空子，夸大事实，企图在群众中间降低党的威信，动摇人民对于社会主义的信仰，诱使一部分认识不清的中间分子跟着起哄。
    他们使出了许多的“理论”和“建议”的花招。最后，真相毕露，公然反对人民民主专政，反对共产党领导。
    反对人民民主专政和共产党的领导，就是要把国家从社会主义的道路上倒退下来，退到那里去呢？资产阶级的议会政治么？如果他们是这样想的，那真是白天作梦！中国如果离开了共产党的领导，取消了无产阶级专政，跟着来的绝不会是什么资产阶级的议会政治，而是只会招来了帝国主义势力在中国的复辟，招来了殖民地的命运，招来被奴役！
    这一点，右派分子思想上是不通的。
    正由于他们这一点不通，他们就昧着良心、闭着眼睛，不承认八年来我们的成绩是主要的，而且讨厌人家说成绩是主要的！
    他们在这一点之所以不通，对于资产阶级议会政治所以那样恋恋不舍，就因为占领在他们灵魂深处的，是资产阶级思想！
    今天的右派问题还是人民内部矛盾。各方面对于右派分子的批判，还是从团结的愿望出发的。何香凝老人苦口婆心，希望“右派分子不要甘心于长久做右派，而应该不断地改造自己，提高自己。”现在正是右派分子老老实实检查自己思想的时候。
    在思想战线上，今儿是斗争的又一回合。反社会主义的思想暴露了，得到批判了。可是资产阶级思想不会就此在人们头脑中绝迹，思想斗争是经常的。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是为了使得思想斗争活泼而深入，使得思想斗争不犯教条主义的错误；而大“放”、大“鸣”之时必须有大“争”，也正是为了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的坚决贯彻和健康地发展！
