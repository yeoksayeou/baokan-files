From Primitive Society into Socialist Society
Li People Sing the Praises of the Communist Party

(Our newspaper, Haikou, 28th) Lin Yuechuan (Li ethnicity), Vice Governor of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, who had just returned here from a visit to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, gave a talk to reporters from the New Hainan Newspaper on the 25th, refuting the anti-socialist statements of right-wing elements.

He said that the Communist Party is the savior of the Li people, and anyone who opposes the Communist Party will be fought to the end. He told reporters that history cannot be erased. The oppression of the Li people by the ruling classes of past dynasties was even more cruel than that of the Han people. As far as I know, since the Han Dynasty, reactionary rulers have carried out more than 20 "suppressions" against the Li people. Feng Zicai of the Qing Dynasty and Chen Hanguang of the Kuomintang were even more brutal in their massacres of the Li people. For many years, our brothers and sisters spent countless winters naked. We could only cultivate with homemade wooden plows, and when we were not full, we would go up the mountains to eat tree roots and bark, living a "primitive society life." In order to strive for freedom, the Li people fought the rulers one after another. Our ancestors fell, and the next generation followed. It was not until 1943 that we found the Communist Party, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, the struggle was victorious.

After the liberation of Hainan in 1950, the Li people became masters of the country for the first time. The Party sent the best doctors, engineers, teachers, and cadres to help us build. The state invested in the development of Hainan, and as far as I know, the money spent in the autonomous prefecture was more than in general Han areas. In just seven years, we have leapt from primitive society into socialist society, ending the past life of "slash-and-burn cultivation." Our agricultural production has developed faster than some Han areas. Last year, the total agricultural output of the entire prefecture averaged 731 jin of grain per person. There were also seven "thousand-jin" cooperatives and four "thousand-jin" townships. In the better-run agricultural cooperatives, a workday earned 1.85 yuan. In 1953, the government helped us build the largest Duzong water conservancy and irrigation project on the island. This year's early rice harvest has been the fourth consecutive bumper harvest for farmers of all ethnic groups in the irrigated area. In the Xianfeng Cooperative of Nanliu Township, Ledong County, 147 cooperative members have increased their income year after year, and all their children are in school, with some even entering middle school. This is unprecedented in history. In 1954, there were only four middle schools in the entire prefecture, but now there are ten, with more than 3,000 students. Half of the rural illiterate people have received preliminary education. In the past, we did not have our own written language, but now the government has also sent experts and professors to help us create the Li language. Each county has also established film projection teams and broadcasting stations. From the county to the district to the township, there are hospitals, health clinics, health centers, and schools. We had never seen a car before, but now transportation is accessible in all directions. Most of the districts have installed telephones, and quite a few townships can also make calls. In terms of industry, thirteen factories, including power generation and sugar production, have been established successively in recent years. In the past, the phenomenon of a few Han merchants cheating us out of dozens of kilograms of rice with one or two salted fish and a betel nut has also been completely eradicated because the state has taken control of the market and implemented unified purchase and sales. Now, we can exchange a dan of rice for more than 20 chi of cloth, which is more than 11 chi more than in 1950.

Lin Yuechuan said, may I ask which government in history has done so many good things for the Li people as the Communist Party and the People's Government? In order to praise today's beautiful life, our Li brothers and sisters have composed countless songs, one of which goes like this:

"Living in Yangyun Ridge in the mountains, the deep mountains are covered and invisible to the light, sunflower leaves cover the roof to avoid the cold wind, the diet is different from the people of the world; white grass vine hearts are used as vegetables, sweet potatoes and taro are used as rice, which is very bleak, drink a bowl of porridge for many days, and rarely have oil and salt; cutting firewood in the daytime without clothes to wear, sleeping at night without blankets, there is no road to go out, climbing mountains and ridges with hands holding vines. Fortunately, the Communist Party came, the Li and Miao turned over and were liberated, the People's Government led well, and the clothing, food, housing, and transportation changed."

Many foreign reporters who came to our autonomous prefecture to visit were also moved when they heard these songs. Now, if right-wing elements want to oppose the leadership of the Party, our Li people will never let them off. (Zeng Shan)

### 从原始社会跨入社会主义社会  黎族人民歌颂共产党

　　从原始社会跨入社会主义社会
    黎族人民歌颂共产党
    本报海口28日电　刚从延边朝鲜族自治州参观回到此间的海南黎族苗族自治州副州长林岳川（黎族），25日对此间的新海南报社记者发表谈话，驳斥右派分子反社会主义的言论。
    他说，共产党是黎族人民的救星，谁要反对共产党，就要同他斗争到底。他对记者说，历史是不能抹煞的。历代的统治阶级对黎族人民的压迫，比对汉族尤为惨烈。就我所知，自汉朝以来，反动统治者对黎族的“征剿”就有二十多次。清朝的冯子才、国民党时的陈汉光，对黎族的残杀更甚。多少年来，我们的兄弟裸露着身体度过了数不尽的冬天。我们只能用自制的木犁耕种，吃不饱时便上山吃树根树皮。过的是“原始社会生活”。黎族人民为了争取自由，前仆后继地和统治者进行斗争。我们的先辈倒下去了，后一辈的人再跟上来。直到1943年找到了共产党，在共产党的领导下，斗争才获得了胜利。
    1950年海南解放后，黎族人民第一次成了国家的主人。党派了最好的医生、工程师、教师和干部来帮助我们建设。国家投资开发海南，就我所知，用在自治州的钱比一般汉族地区还要多。仅仅经过七年的时间，我们就从原始社会跨入社会主义社会。结束了过去“刀耕火种”的生活。我们在农业生产方面发展的速度，比一些汉族地区还快。去年，全州农业总产量平均每人就分得原粮七百三十一斤。并且出现有七个千斤社，四个千斤乡。办得较好的农业社，一个劳动日就得到一元八角五分。1953年，政府帮助我们建成了全岛最大的都总水利灌溉工程。今年早稻，灌溉区里的各族农民又是第四次的获得丰收。乐东县南流乡先锋社一百四十七位社员、由于连年增加收入，人人的子弟都上了学，其中有的人还进了中学。这是历史上从来没有过的事。1954年全州只有四所中学，现在已发展到十所，学生有三千多人。有半数的农村文盲受到初步教育。过去，我们没有自己的文字，现在政府也派专家、教授来帮助我们创造了黎文。每个县还建立了电影放映队、广播站。从县到区到乡都有医院、卫生所、保健站和学校。从前，我们根本没见过汽车，而现在交通是四通八达。绝大部分的区架设了电话，能通话的乡也不少。工业方面，几年来也先后建立了发电和制糖等十三个工厂。过去，少数汉族商人以一两咸鱼一个槟榔骗取我们几十斤大米的现象，也由于国家掌握了市场和实行统购统销而根本灭迹。现在，我们生产一担稻谷能换回二十多尺布，比1950年时还要增加十一尺多。
    林岳川说，试问历史上有那个政府像共产党、人民政府为黎族人民作出这许多的好事。为了歌颂今天的美好生活，我们的黎族兄弟不知编了多少歌谣，其中有一首就是这样唱的：
    “住在山腰羊云岗，深山盖过不见光，葵叶盖屋避冷风呵，饮食不同世上人呵；白草藤心来做菜，薯芋做饭好凄凉，多日喝上一碗粥呵，从来少有油盐放呵；白天砍柴没衣穿，晚上睡觉没被盖，出门没有大路走呵，上山下岭手牵藤呵。幸得来了共产党，黎苗翻身得解放，人民政府领导好呵，衣食住行变了样呵。”
    很多国外记者到我们自治州来访问，听到这些歌谣也受到感动。现在，右派分子要反对党的领导，我们黎族人民是决不肯同它罢休的。　（曾珊）
