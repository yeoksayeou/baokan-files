Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 10th: Newspapers here reported on June 9th that the Bulgarian Council of Ministers made a decision on May 29th to expand green areas in cities, rural areas, factories, along roads and railways, along rivers, by the Black Sea, and around reservoirs in the coming years.

In the past few years, Bulgaria's green areas have been continuously expanded. In 1956, the green area in cities across the country had reached an average of more than five square meters per resident, while in 1952, it was less than three square meters per resident. Currently, cultural rest parks have been built in larger cities. Factories, agricultural cooperatives, state farms, and machine tractor stations have also started greening efforts in recent years. However, so far, the achievements of greening work cannot meet the growing needs of the people and the requirements of socialist urban construction.

The decision of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers stipulated the greening tasks of relevant departments and executive committees of people's congresses at all levels, as well as the specific timelines and methods for completing the tasks.

　　保加利亚扩大绿化面积
　　拟定具体步骤满足人民的需要
    新华社索非亚10日电  9日，这里的报纸报道，保加利亚部长会议在5月29日作出决议，要在最近几年内在城市、农村、工厂、公路和铁路两旁、河流两岸、黑海边以及水库四周等地方扩大绿化面积。
    过去几年，保加利亚的绿化面积不断扩大。1956年，全国城市中绿化的面积已经达到平均每个居民有五平方公尺多，而在1952年，平均每个居民还不到三平方公尺。目前在较大的城市里，都修建了文化休息公园。工厂、农业合作社、国营农场、机器拖拉机站等也在近几年里开始了绿化工作。但是到目前为止，绿化工作的成绩还不能满足人民日益增长的需要和社会主义城市建设的要求。
    保加利亚部长会议的决议规定了有关主管部门和各级人民会议执行委员会的绿化工作任务和完成任务的具体时间、办法。
