Xinhua News Agency, PingLe Electric Dispatch, reporter Guo Chunqing reports: "Since spring and summer, the weather has been favorable, and even the worst seedlings are better than last year!" This encouraging news from the countryside has aroused the deep attention of the CCP Guangxi Province PingLe Prefectural Committee. Because problems often arise amidst cheers.

How is agricultural production this year? According to the Prefectural Committee's inspection and analysis, it is not entirely optimistic: This year, the entire prefecture planted 1.43 million mu of early rice, and indeed caught up with a favorable season. Farmers are also relatively satisfied with the stable approach to technical reforms. However, at present, only one-third of the seedlings are better than last year; and due to various reasons, the early rice planting area has decreased by more than 100,000 mu compared to last year, and it is estimated that the harvest will be reduced by 40 million catties of rice. The leading departments have not yet studied well how to remedy this loss. Secondly, the rainfall this year is heavy, and large and small rivers are rising. How to prevent floods and drain waterlogged areas, how to rush to repair water conservancy projects before the summer harvest, and strictly prevent drought in the second half of the year, the relevant departments have not put forward active measures. On the other hand, although the quality of accumulated fertilizer in the entire prefecture's more than 900 agricultural cooperatives has improved compared to last year, the quantity has been greatly reduced. Some agricultural cooperatives have already run out of fertilizer, and the transplanting of mid-season rice is slow to progress, and there is no reliable hope for the fertilizer needed for late-season rice. In addition, some farmers lack food and money before the new grain is harvested, which will directly affect agricultural and sideline production.

In response to the above situation, the CCP PingLe Prefectural Committee convened an emergency meeting of county party secretaries to reverse the mood of paralysis and complacency. It demanded that in the one and a half months before the new grain is harvested, the work of grain supply should be done conscientiously to ensure that households lacking grain have grain; at the same time, field management should be strengthened to eliminate pests, farmers' household fertilizer should be rationally purchased, green manure should be massively composted, and efforts should be made to apply fertilizer to early rice fields once to increase yield per unit area and make up for reduced harvest losses. According to the current rainfall situation, it is urgently necessary to mobilize the masses to replenish ponds and build dams, inspect and repair water conservancy projects, intercept and store rainwater, actively prevent waterlogging and drought, and truly be prepared for any eventuality.

### 叫好声中有问题  中共平乐地委扭转盲目乐观情绪

　　叫好声中有问题
    中共平乐地委扭转盲目乐观情绪
    据新华社平乐电　新华社记者郭纯青报道：“春夏以来风调雨顺，最坏的禾苗也比去年好！”这一来自农村的振奋人心的消息，引起了中共广西省平乐地方委员会的深切注意。因为有些事情往往是在一片叫好声中出了问题。
    今年农业生产情况到底如何？据地委检查分析，并不那么令人完全乐观：今年全专区种早稻一百四十三万亩，确实赶上了风调雨顺的季节，在技术改革上的稳妥作法，农民也比较满意。但是，目前不过只有三分之一的禾苗比去年好；又因种种原因，早稻种植面积比去年减少十万多亩，预计将减收四千万斤稻谷。这项损失如何补救，领导部门却没有很好研究。其次，今年雨量大，大江小河正在涨水，如何防洪排涝、如何在夏收前抢修水利，严防下半年出现旱灾，有关部门并没有提出积极措施。另一方面，全专区九百多个农业社，积存肥料质量虽然比去年提高，而数量大大减少。一部分农业社现已断肥，中稻插秧迟缓不前，晚稻需用肥料更无可靠指望。还有一部分农民在新谷登场前缺粮缺钱，会直接影响农副业生产。
    中共平乐地委针对以上情况，召开一次县委书记紧急会议，扭转麻痹自满情绪。要求在新谷登场前一个半月内，认真作好粮食供应工作，保证缺粮户有粮；同时加强田间管理，消灭虫害，合理收购农民家庭肥料，大批沤制绿肥，争取在早稻田中追施一次肥料，以提高单位面积产量，弥补减收损失。根据目前落雨情况，急需动员群众补塘筑坝，检修水利，拦蓄雨水，积极防涝防旱，切实做到有备无患。
