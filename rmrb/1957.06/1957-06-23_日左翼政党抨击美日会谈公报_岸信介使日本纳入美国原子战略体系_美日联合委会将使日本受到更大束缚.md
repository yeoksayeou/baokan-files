Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today criticizing the joint communiqué of the Kishi Nobusuke-Eisenhower talks. The statement believes that the result of Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States is a decisive step in making Japan a part of the US nuclear energy strategy system.

The Socialist Party pointed out that the issue of abolishing the US-Japan Security Treaty was ignored. Camouflaging the withdrawal of US ground forces as a manifestation of "US-Japan equality" is also unnecessary from Japan's perspective. The communiqué not only made no mention of the withdrawal of US naval and air forces, but also reaffirmed the indefinite US occupation of Okinawa.

The statement added that today, the matter we are most closely concerned with is the bringing of nuclear weapons into Japan. Although Kishi Nobusuke had repeatedly indicated his position on this matter before his departure, the communiqué did not mention it, proving that Kishi Nobusuke had abandoned his promise to the people.

The statement said that Eisenhower welcomed the plan to strengthen Japan's military power that Kishi Nobusuke brought to the United States. This indicates that the joint committee of the two governments, to be newly established under the pretext of studying the US-Japan Security Treaty, will exert greater pressure on Japan, forcing it to revise its constitution and dispatch troops abroad.

The Socialist Party regrets that the US-Japan talks did not affirm the relaxation of trade restrictions with China, but instead vigorously emphasized the need to restrict the export of "strategic materials."

The Socialist Party believes that the sense of unease given by Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States has become a reality. It reiterated that it will continue to vigorously carry out movements to strive for the revision and abolition of unequal treaties, the return of Okinawa to Japan, opposition to the militarization of Japan's bases, the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, and the abolition of trade restrictions on China.

Japanese Communist Party leader Yoshio Shiga gave a speech in Matsuyama today, exposing the Kishi Nobusuke-Eisenhower joint communiqué as a disguise used to appease the Japanese people who oppose US policies, including the US soldiers' killing of Japanese women, the Okinawa issue, and nuclear weapons testing.

Shiga also condemned the establishment of a joint committee to study the US-Japan Security Treaty as an attempt to bind Japan to the United States in every possible way.

　　日左翼政党抨击美日会谈公报
    岸信介使日本纳入美国原子战略体系
    美日联合委会将使日本受到更大束缚
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，抨击岸信介和艾森豪威尔的会谈公报。声明认为，岸信介的美国之行的结果是使日本成为美国原子能战略体系的一环的一个决定性的步骤。
    社会党指出，废除日美安全条约这件事被置之不问。把撤退美国地面部队伪装成“日美平等”的表现，从日本方面看来，这也是不必要的。在公报中不仅丝毫没有谈到撤退美国海空军的问题，而且重新肯定了美国对冲绳岛的无限期占领。
    声明又说，今天，我们最密切关心的事情是把核子武器运进日本这件事，而岸信介在动身之前对这件事也曾屡次有所表明，虽然如此，会谈公报并未谈到这一点，这证明岸信介背弃了他对国民所作的诺言。
    声明说，岸信介携带到美国去的加强日本军力的计划受到艾森豪威尔的欢迎，这说明一定会通过借口研究日美安全条约而新建立的两国政府的联合委员会，对日本加强压力，使日本修改宪法和派兵出国。
    社会党对日美会谈没有肯定放宽对中国的贸易限制反而极力强调限制“战略物资”出口的必要性，感到遗憾。
    社会党认为，关于岸信介访问美国给人的不安感觉已经变为现实。它再次声明，今后要继续大力开展争取修改和废除不平等条约、使冲绳岛归还日本、反对日本军事基地化、同中国恢复邦交、撤销对中国的贸易限制等运动。
    日本共产党领袖志贺义雄今天在松山发表谈话，揭露岸信介和艾森豪威尔的会谈公报是一种伪装，用来缓和反对美国政策的日本人民，美国政策中包括美国兵枪杀日本妇女事件、冲绳问题和核武器试验等。
    志贺并且谴责设立研究日美安全条约的联合委员会是企图用各种可能使日本受美国的束缚。
