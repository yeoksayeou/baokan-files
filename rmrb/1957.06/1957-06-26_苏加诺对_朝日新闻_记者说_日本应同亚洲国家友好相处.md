Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 25th: According to Antara News Agency, President Sukarno told Taniguchi, a reporter from the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," today that the situation in Asia is rapidly changing and developing. Japan should recognize this situation and become a member of the nations that get along with each other in friendship.

Sukarno believes that it is indeed a strange thing that Japan, which is located in Asia and geographically close to Indonesia, has not yet established diplomatic relations with Indonesia. Sukarno pointed out that the issue of war reparations must also be resolved. This is a fact, and he believes that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible. He said that this would enable the two countries to improve their relations with each other on a new basis.

　　苏加诺对“朝日新闻”记者说
    日本应同亚洲国家友好相处
    据新华社雅加达25日电  据安塔拉通讯社报道，苏加诺总统今天对日本“朝日新闻”记者谷口说，亚洲的情况正在迅速变化和发展中，日本应当认清这个局势而成为友好相处的各民族的一员。
    苏加诺认为，位于亚洲、在地理上同印度尼西亚接近的日本，竟然还没有和印度尼西亚建立外交关系，这的确是一件奇怪的事情。苏加诺指出，还必须解决战争赔款问题，这是一个事实，他认为这个问题越快解决越好。他说，这样能使两国在新的基础上来改进彼此之间的关系。
