    Where is France Heading?
    Yang Mu
    More than half a month has passed since the Mollet government resigned, and the activities to form a new cabinet in France have not made any progress. René Pleven, leader of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, was the first to fail in forming a cabinet. Then, Independent Party's Pinay refused the appointment to form a cabinet because he had no confidence in succeeding. Currently, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury of the Popular Republican Movement is running around to organize a new government, but the "hope is dim."
    The fall of the Mollet government and the difficult birth of a new cabinet reflect that the military suppression policy in Algeria has plunged France into an extremely difficult situation.
          The Root Cause of the Cabinet Crisis
    The Algerian War has already caused incurable diseases in France's finances and economy. The near exhaustion of foreign exchange is a serious problem for the French economy today. To solve this problem, the Mollet government proposed measures to restrict imports and encourage exports at the beginning of this year. To increase exports and make up for the shortage of goods on the domestic market caused by restricting imports, production must be increased. According to experts from the French Ministry of Finance and Economy, production will increase by 5.6% in 1957. However, the increase in imports of raw materials and fuel required for this will increase the foreign trade deficit to more than 500 billion francs, not including the import of new military materials.
    France's foreign trade deficit in the first quarter has increased nearly double compared to the same period last year, and the deficit that must be paid in foreign exchange is more than 160 billion francs. At present, France's foreign exchange reserves are less than 200 million US dollars (approximately 62 billion francs), and it is still in debt of 94 million US dollars in the Western European "Payment Union." Although gold reserves currently amount to approximately 1.1 billion US dollars, the minimum point for gold reserves to maintain the value of the franc is 860 million US dollars, and only 240 million US dollars is available.
    France's financial difficulties are also extremely serious. General military expenditure in 1957 reached 1,010 billion francs, Algerian military expenditure accounted for 360 billion francs, and direct military expenditure for the invasion of Egypt (to be spent in the 1957 budget) was approximately 200 billion francs. This huge military expenditure resulted in a budget deficit of 630 billion francs; the total treasury deficit will exceed 1 trillion francs.
    Under these circumstances, the Mollet government was forced to decide to cut budget expenditures for this year and proposed measures to increase taxes. These practices proposed by Mollet did not touch the root cause of France's financial and economic difficulties, but aroused dissatisfaction among some monopoly capital groups. Therefore, when the National Assembly voted on the government's tax increase proposal on May 21, approximately 100 conservative (including the Independent Party and the Independent Peasant Party, etc.) members also voted against it. This prevented Mollet from obtaining a majority vote and finally led to his resignation.
        Why Pinay Was Unwilling to Form a Cabinet
    After Mollet resigned, Pinay, the leader of the Independent Party who brought down the cabinet, did not accept the task of forming a cabinet according to political conventions. There are reasons for this.
    The conservatives' desire to push Mollet aside and come to power themselves has been brewing for a long time. Although Mollet practically abandoned his campaign promises and basically implemented right-wing policies; in terms of financial and economic policies, the opinions of the conservatives and the Socialist Party were not consistent. Regarding the Algerian policy, although Mollet implemented a military suppression policy that was more vigorous than previous French governments, the conservatives still felt it was not enough.
    Since the end of last year, the conservatives have been using the Hungarian and Polish incidents to stir up an anti-Soviet and anti-communist countercurrent. On the other hand, they have been using the failure of Mollet's policies to carry out vigorous activities, and their arrogance has increased to a certain extent. In the two local by-elections in the first constituency of the Seine province in January of this year and in the Ain province in March of this year, the conservatives' votes increased greatly compared to last year. The conservatives believed that the time for them to come to power and govern themselves had become ripe, and they began to actively prepare to replace Mollet.
    When Mollet received a delegation from the Independent Party led by Pinay on January 25 to discuss the Algerian issue, the Independent Party began its offensive. It expressed opposition to Mollet's proposal to hold "universal suffrage" in Algeria and condemned Mollet's tax policy. In the National Assembly's vote of confidence on March 29, 76 members of the "Independent Party-Peasant Party-Social Action Alliance" abstained, which was a demonstration against Mollet.
    However, under the current circumstances, it is still very difficult for the conservatives to form a cabinet. First of all, the situation after the elections at the beginning of last year was that without the support of the Socialist Party, the right wing would not be able to form a majority in the parliament. And the leadership of the Socialist Party regards the important position of the Socialist Party in the parliament as a capital for them to deal with the right wing, and they seem to think that they are indispensable and do not want to lower their value immediately. This makes the compromise between the Socialist Party and the conservatives, who should be responsible for its downfall, temporarily difficult. The Socialist Party has stated that it will not participate in a cabinet that includes members of the Independent Party. Secondly, apart from relying on "US aid," the right wing has no other way to overcome the current economic crisis. And in dealing with the Americans, the lessons of Indochina and the Middle East, the emergence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and the United States' coveting of the Sahara have all aroused the vigilance of the French ruling group. Since there is no more brilliant way to solve the thorny problems that the Mollet government once encountered, the conservatives do not seem ready to bear this burden at present.
      Divisions Within the "Republican Front"
    Paris observers estimate that the new cabinet may still be formed on the basis of the original "Republican Front" participating in the government. However, the original "Republican Front" is currently in a state of disintegration.
    The French Radical Socialist Party has already split due to differences over the Algerian issue. Under the huge pressure of grassroots party members, the resolution passed by the Radical Socialist Party's Congress in October of last year criticized the Mollet government's Algerian policy. A faction led by former Prime Minister Queuille and former Minister of Industry and Commerce Maurice-Bokanowski announced their withdrawal from the party because they supported Mollet's Algerian policy.
    The resolution passed by the special representative assembly in May demanded that the government "make decisive changes to the Algerian policy." However, several Radical Party ministers who participated in the Mollet government supported the government's current Algerian policy. In the vote of confidence on May 21, two members of the party did not comply with the party's resolution and voted in support of Mollet. Mendès-France proposed expelling the two from the party. This suggestion was rejected, and Mendès-France then resigned.
    Within the Socialist Party, divisions are also deepening, and the forces demanding a change in the Algerian policy are gradually rising. When the National Committee of the Socialist Party voted in December 1956 to support Mollet's policy of "combining reform and pacification" in Algeria, only 270 votes were against it and 70 abstained; in the National Committee's vote on trusting Mollet's policy in May of this year, the number of votes against increased to 401, and the number of abstentions increased to 435.
    This situation makes it difficult to reorganize a "Republican Front" government.
    Bourgès-Maunoury, who is conducting cabinet formation activities, is trying to organize a so-called "national alliance" government including various parties from the Socialist Party to the Conservative Party, but this plan has been opposed by the Socialist Party, so Bourgès-Maunoury will have to abandon this plan. Bourgès-Maunoury has repeatedly stated that without the participation of the Socialist Party, he cannot form a cabinet. According to reports, after holding a National Committee discussion on the cabinet issue, the Socialist Party has decided to demand that the new French government continue to implement Mollet's old policies as a condition for the Socialist Party's support.
    Based on the above situation, no matter what basis the so-called "Republican Front" and the conservatives finally reach a compromise on, the new government will be a change in name only. If the root cause of the government crisis is not eliminated, any new government will face the same problems.
            The Way Out of the Crisis
    So, where is the way out of the French government crisis?
    The French reactionaries once used the chaos caused by the Polish and Hungarian incidents to try to reverse the trend of the people increasingly turning to the left, which was manifested in last year's elections. However, they only achieved some temporary and partial successes. Because the French Communist Party and the French progressive forces have repelled the anti-Soviet and anti-communist countercurrent, and have unremittingly insisted on efforts for the united action of the working class and actively promoted the development of the "People's Front" movement, the left-leaning trend in France has gradually recovered and grown.
    The recent election of the mayor of Lyon actually showed the victory of the "People's Front." After three elections, Radical Socialist Pradel was elected mayor with the support of the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party.
    In the recent (May 19) by-election in Lyon (first round), the French Communist Party's vote has approached the vote situation in 1956, and the absolute number has exceeded the right wing, and it has begun to change the situation in the by-elections in the Seine and Ain provinces in January and March of this year.
    This left-leaning trend among the French people shows their opinion on which path France should take. Although the left has not been able to have a decisive influence on the French government's decision-making due to the stubborn refusal of the right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party to cooperate with the Communist Party. However, the people are increasingly strongly demanding a change in the current policies of the French government, first of all abandoning the colonial policy towards Algeria. To find a way out of the current predicament, France can only, as the French Communist Party's statement pointed out, first immediately stop the Algerian War, recognize the Algerian people's right to national autonomy, and establish friendly relations between France and Algeria on this basis.

    法国向何处去？
    羊木
    摩勒政府辞职到现在已经半个多月了，法国组织新内阁的活动还是一直没有进展。民主社会抵抗联盟领袖雷纳·普利文第一个组阁失败。接着独立党的比内因没有成功的把握，拒绝组阁任命。目前人民共和党的弗林姆兰正在为组织新政府而奔走，但也是“希望暗淡”。
    摩勒政府的倒台和新内阁的难产，反映着对阿尔及利亚的军事镇压政策已经使法国陷入了一个极端困难的处境。
          内阁危机的根本原因
    阿尔及利亚战争已经引起了法国财政经济上的不治之症。外汇形将枯竭，是法国经济当前一个严重的问题。为了解决这个问题，摩勒政府在今年年初提出了限制进口、鼓励出口的措施。要增加出口，并且弥补因限制进口而引起的国内市场上商品的不足，就必须提高生产。据法国财政经济部专家估计，1957年生产将增加5.6％。但是因此而所需原料、燃料进口的增加，将使对外贸易逆差增加为五千多亿法郎，其中还不包括新的军事物资的进口。
    法国第一季度对外贸易逆差已比去年同期增长几近一倍，须用外汇支付的逆差为一千六百多亿法郎。目前法国外汇储备不及二亿美元（约六百二十亿法郎），在西欧“支付同盟”中还亏空了九千四百万美元。黄金储备目前虽有约十一亿美元，但为维持法郎币值的黄金储备最低点是八亿六千万美元，可动用的不过二亿四千万美元。
    法国财政上的困难也是极为严重的。1957年一般军费开支达一万零十亿法郎，阿尔及利亚军费占了三千六百亿法郎，侵略埃及战争直接军费（须在1957年预算中支出）又是约二千亿法郎。这种巨大军事开支使预算赤字达六千三百亿法郎；以国库总赤字计将超过一万亿法郎。
    在这种情况下，摩勒政府不得已而决定削减今年预算开支，并且提出了增加税收的措施。摩勒提出的这些做法并没触及造成法国财政经济困难的根本原因，却引起了一部分垄断资本集团的不满。因此，在5月21日国民议会表决政府增税的提案时，约一百名保守派（包括独立党和独立农民党等）议员也投了反对票。这就使摩勒不能得到多数票而终于提出辞职了。
        比内为什么不愿意组阁
    在摩勒辞职以后，倒阁的独立党的领袖比内却没有按照政治惯例接受组阁的任务。这中间也有缘故。
    保守派想推开摩勒而自己上台，是酝酿已久的事。虽然摩勒实际上丢开了自己竞选中的诺言，而基本上执行右派的政策；但是在财经政策上，保守派和社会党的意见并不一致。在阿尔及利亚政策方面，尽管摩勒执行军事镇压政策，比历届法国政府都更卖力，保守派仍感到不够满意。
    去年年底以来，保守派一方面利用波匈事件掀起反苏反共逆流，另一方面又利用摩勒政策的失败，大肆活动，气焰有一定增长。在今年1月塞纳省第一选区和今年3月爱茵省的两次地方补缺选举中，保守派得票都比去年大大增加了。保守派以为由他们亲自上台执政的时机已经趋于成熟，就开始为取代摩勒而积极准备。
    今年1月25日摩勒接见比内率领的独立党代表团商谈阿尔及利亚问题时，独立党就开始了进攻。它表示反对摩勒的在阿尔及利亚举行“普选”的主张，并谴责摩勒的税收政策。3月29日国民议会信任投票中，“独立党农民党社会行动联盟”七十六名议员弃权，就是一次对摩勒的示威。
    不过，在目前的情况下，保守派要组阁，困难还是很多的。首先，去年年初选举后的局面是，如果没有社会党的支持，右派在议会中无法形成多数。而社会党的领导方面把社会党在议会中举足轻重的地位作为他们同右派打交道的一项资本，大有非我莫属的样子，还不想马上就降低自己的身价。这使得社会党和对它下台应当负责的保守派之间的妥协一时较为困难。社会党已经声明它将不参加有独立党人参加的内阁。其次，右派除了依靠“美援”以外，也并没有度过目前经济危机的其他办法。而在同美国人打交道方面，印度支那和中东的教训，“艾森豪威尔主义”的出笼，美国对撒哈拉的垂涎，都引起法国统治集团的戒心。要解决摩勒政府曾经碰到的棘手的问题，既然并没有什么更高明的办法，所以保守派目前似乎也还没有准备好来背这个锅。
      “共和阵线”内部的分歧
    巴黎的观察家有一种估计，新内阁可能仍旧在原来参加政府的“共和阵线”的基础上扩大组成。但是，原来的“共和阵线”目前也处在分崩离析的状态中。
    法国激进社会党已经因阿尔及利亚问题上的分歧而发生了分裂。在基层党员的巨大压力下，去年10月激进社会党的代表大会通过的决议，批评了摩勒政府的阿尔及利亚政策。以前总理葛义和前工商部长摩里斯为首的一派因为支持摩勒的阿尔及利亚政策，就宣布退党。
    在今年5月的特别代表大会通过的决议要求政府“对阿尔及利亚政策予以决定性的改变”。但是参加摩勒政府的几个激进党部长对于政府的现行阿尔及利亚政策，却抱支持态度。在5月21日信任投票中，该党两名议员不遵守党的决议，投票支持了摩勒。孟戴斯—弗朗斯提议开除两人的党籍。这一建议遭到否决，孟戴斯—弗朗斯遂提出辞职。
    在社会党内部，分歧也在加深，要求改变阿尔及利亚政策的势力逐渐抬头。1956年12月社会党全国委员会在表决支持摩勒在阿尔及利亚实行的“改革与绥靖相结合”的政策时，只有二百七十票反对，七十票弃权；在今年5月全国委员会就信任摩勒政策投票中，反对的增加为四百零一票，弃权的增加为四百三十五票。
    这种情形，使得重新组成一个“共和阵线”的政府也是困难重重。
    正在进行组阁活动的弗林姆兰企图组织一个包括从社会党到保守派各种政党在内的所谓“全国联盟”政府，但是这个计划已遭到了社会党的反对，因此弗林姆兰将不得不放弃这个打算。弗林姆兰已经一再表示，没有社会党参加，他就无法组成内阁。而据消息说，社会党在举行了一次全国委员会讨论内阁问题以后，已决定要求新的法国政府仍然执行摩勒的老一套政策，以此作为社会党支持的条件。
    根据以上的情况看来，不论所谓“共和阵线”和保守派最后在什么基础上求得妥协，新政府将是换汤不换药。造成政府危机的根本原因不除，任何新的政府都将面临同样的问题。
            摆脱危机的出路
    那末，法国政府危机的出路究竟何在呢？
    法国的反动派曾经利用波匈事件所造成的混乱，力图扭转去年选举中所表现出来的人民日益向左转的趋势。但是他们只暂时获得了一些局部的成功。由于法国共产党和法国进步力量击退了反苏反共逆流，以及不懈地为工人阶级统一行动坚持努力，积极推动“人民阵线”运动的开展，法国国内左倾的趋势又逐渐恢复与增长起来。
    不久前举行的里昂市长的选举，实际上显示了“人民阵线”的胜利。经过三次选举，在法共与社会党的支持下，激进社会党人普拉德勒当选市长。
    在最近（5月19日）里昂补缺选举中（第一轮），法共得票已接近1956年得票情况，绝对数字超过右派，开始改变今年1月及3月在塞纳省及爱茵省补缺选举中的局面。
    法国人民中的这一左倾的趋势，说明了他们对法国应该走那一条路的意见。虽然，由于社会党右翼领导集团顽固地拒绝同共产党合作，左派还没有能够对法国政府的决策起决定的影响。但是，人民正愈来愈强烈地要求改变法国政府现行的政策，首先是抛弃对阿尔及利亚的殖民政策。法国要找到摆脱目前困境的出路，只有像法国共产党声明所指出的那样，首先立即停止阿尔及利亚战争，承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族自主权利，在这个基础上建立法阿的友好关系。
