The Tunisian People Are Unyielding
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The situation in Tunisia has aroused the unease of world opinion. People have noted the warning issued by Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba on June 13: in this country, there is currently a "danger of war breaking out."
    The continued presence of French troops in Tunisia is the root cause of the tense situation there. After being forced to recognize Tunisia's independence, France has used various pretexts to keep its colonial troops stationed there, in order to maintain military control over Tunisia and use it as a base for colonial wars in North Africa. French colonial troops run amok on Tunisian soil, disregarding Tunisian sovereignty. Recently, these troops have even openly refused to implement the decrees of the Tunisian government, arbitrarily moving around within Tunisia and continuously launching attacks on Tunisian troops. As a result, several large-scale armed conflicts have already occurred in Tunisia. The situation is rapidly deteriorating.
    Since its independence, Tunisia has consistently demanded that France withdraw its colonial troops. This time, the Tunisian government has again requested the French government to promptly begin negotiations on the issue of troop withdrawal, and has announced that it will fight resolutely to safeguard its independence. The Tunisian people, who have freed themselves from colonial rule through a long struggle, are determined to fight for the complete independence of their country. Their struggle is just, and therefore has received the unanimous support of the people of Arab countries, and has also won widespread sympathy from the people of all countries in the world. Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna sent a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the President of the Security Council on June 8, requesting UN member states to support Tunisia. Public opinion in various countries, which opposes colonialism and upholds national independence, condemns France's actions that undermine Tunisian sovereignty.
    Past facts have repeatedly proven that for France, the wisest policy is to recognize the national aspirations of the people of North Africa and establish mutually beneficial and friendly relations on the basis of respecting their national independence. Any attempt to maintain control and uphold colonial interests by means of force and bullying can only produce results unfavorable to France. Now that a tense situation has emerged in Tunisia, the responsibility lies entirely with France. If France is blindly confident in its power, thinking that Tunisia is weak and can be bullied, and is willing to break its promises and continue to infringe on Tunisian sovereignty, then people will see French colonialists suffer another shameful end there.

　　突尼斯人民不可屈
　　本报评论员
    突尼斯的局势已经引起了世界舆论的不安。人们注意到突尼斯首相布尔吉巴在6月13日提出的警告：在这个国家里，目前正有着“爆发战争的危险。”
    法国军队继续留在突尼斯，是造成突尼斯紧张局势的祸根。法国在被迫承认突尼斯独立以后，却用种种借口把殖民军队继续驻在那里，以便对突尼斯保持军事上的控制，并利用突尼斯作为在北非进行殖民战争的基地。法国殖民军队在突尼斯土地上胡作非为，无视突尼斯的主权。最近，这些军队还公然拒绝执行突尼斯政府的法令，而在突尼斯境内随便调动，并且连续向突尼斯军队进行袭击。因此，在突尼斯已经发生了好几次大规模的武装冲突。局势正在迅速恶化。
    突尼斯在独立以后，就一直坚持要求法国把殖民军队撤出去。这一次，突尼斯政府又要求法国政府迅速开始关于撤军问题的谈判，并且宣布将以坚决的行动为维护自己的独立而斗争。经过长期斗争而摆脱了殖民统治的突尼斯人民坚决为自己国家的完全独立而斗争。他们的斗争是正义的，因此得到了阿拉伯各国人民的一致支持，也获得了世界各国人民的广泛同情。阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳在6月8日已经给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和安全理事会主席一份备忘录，要求联合国会员国给突尼斯以支持。各国反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的公众舆论，都谴责法国损害突尼斯主权的行为。
    过去的事实已一再证明，对于法国来说，最明智的政策就是承认北非人民的民族愿望，在尊重他们民族独立的基础上建立互利的友好关系。任何靠强力和霸道的办法保持控制和维持殖民利益的企图，都只能产生对法国不利的结果。现在突尼斯已出现了紧张的局势，责任完全是在法国。如果法国迷信强权，以为突尼斯弱小可欺，不惜背弃诺言，继续侵害突尼斯主权，那么人们将会看到法国殖民者在那里遭到另一个可耻的下场。
