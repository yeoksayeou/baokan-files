The Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Decides to Consult with the China Democratic National Construction Association to Jointly Issue Instructions
Criticize Zhang Naqi's Thought and Clarify the Understanding of Industrial and Commercial Circles

(Our newspaper reports) The Second Executive Committee Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce decided at its second meeting yesterday to consult with the China Democratic National Construction Association to jointly issue an instruction, analyzing and criticizing Zhang Naqi's recent series of erroneous speeches in order to clarify the understanding of people in industrial and commercial circles.

Some of the standing committee members attending the meeting also serve as standing committee members of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Those who spoke at the meeting yesterday included Chen Shutong, Li Zhuchen, Sheng Pihua, Hu Zi'ang, Bi Mingqi, Le Songsheng, Chen Jingyu, Huang Changshui, Hu Juewen, and 28 others. They seriously analyzed the seriousness of Zhang Naqi's erroneous remarks and pointed out the necessity of issuing a joint instruction.

Le Songsheng said in his speech: Zhang Naqi's anti-socialist remarks have already had a very bad influence. Some students in the short-term training class for industrial and commercial circles in Beijing have been confused and mistakenly believe that Zhang's opinions represent the thinking of people in industrial and commercial circles. One group of students even refused to accept ideological remolding, saying that the view of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie is dogmatism. I think people in industrial and commercial circles should study the recent People's Daily editorials, distinguish right from wrong, and criticize Zhang Naqi's reactionary thinking vehemently.

Hu Zi'ang said: Zhang Naqi's mistakes are not accidental. At the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association last year, everyone helped and advised him on his mistakes. Recently, I also had arguments with him, but he has always insisted on his erroneous views. "Thorough transformation" was originally a very vivid metaphor to describe the ideological remolding of the bourgeoisie, but Zhang quoted it as "drawing out sinews and peeling off skin" to create alarmist talk. Some industrial and commercial people in Chongqing added the conclusion "only to be a good person in the next life," which is very detrimental to the remolding work. Hu Zi'ang believes that the ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen is at the time when "the melon is about to ripen; the water is about to arrive." Zhang Naqi believes that there is no difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. This is picking unripe melons and demolishing canals that have not yet been filled with water. This is to cancel the ideological remolding of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we should give this kind of erroneous thinking a serious struggle and not let it spread.

Miao Hainan said: Zhang Naqi's remarks have already caused a bad influence in industrial and commercial circles. The leadership of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should quickly stand up and refute them. On the one hand, we must quickly write articles and issue instructions to clarify the thinking of industrial and commercial circles. On the other hand, everyone will give Zhang Naqi another comrade-like help.

Zhu Jisheng said: In this help to the Party's rectification campaign, the most unsatisfactory thing is that Zhang Naqi and others took the opportunity to attack the Communist Party. We cannot accept anti-socialist remarks. Zhang Naqi, in view of our bourgeoisie's weaknesses of wavering, instilled capitalist ideas into us. Zhang believes that there is no difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, the dual nature of the bourgeoisie no longer exists, and the working class also has a dual nature. These remarks are creating ideological confusion in industrial and commercial circles, taking the opportunity to peddle his capitalist ideas. We must criticize Zhang's remarks and continue to help the Party rectify its style of work.

Wang Guangying revealed the conspiracy used by Zhang Naqi. He said: From the articles published by Zhang Naqi, we can see his conspiracy and tricks: First, he randomly labeled those who argued with him, saying that they were dogmatists; Second, he used the tactics of beating and wooing, wooing Li Kangnian and Bi Mingqi, and attacking activists; Third, his remarks were like selling dog meat under the guise of mutton. At the beginning of the article, he quoted Chairman Mao's words, and then peddled his own thoughts. He has always been selling official salt mixed with private salt, and his methods are very clever. He viciously wanted to overthrow the revolutionary class viewpoint and the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism. He said that the working class also has a dual nature, which is to deify the bourgeoisie and demonize the working class.

Chen Jingyu said: Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, Zhang Naqi is carrying out activities against socialism. He is not only helping industrial and commercial circles negatively but is also harming us. Zhang Naqi is the vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and a leader of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Some people in industrial and commercial circles believe what he says. I think it is very important to refute his thinking. Only by analyzing his thoughts one by one can we achieve the purpose of educating industrial and commercial circles.

Maimaitiniyazi Harez said: Our goal is to build socialism. I think remarks and behaviors that deviate from socialism should be strictly prohibited. Our industrial and commercial circles must take the socialist road. No one can make us leave this bright road. I hope that the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation

### 全国工商联常委会决定商同民建会联合发指示  批判章乃器思想澄清工商界视听

　　全国工商联常委会决定商同民建会联合发指示
　　批判章乃器思想澄清工商界视听
    本报讯  全国工商联第二届执委会常务委员会第二次会议昨天决定商同中国民主建国会联合发布一个指示，分析批判章乃器近来发表的一连串错误言论，以澄清工商界人士的视听。
      出席这次会议的常务委员，有一部分人兼任民主建国会常务委员。
    昨天在会上发言的有陈叔通、李烛尘、盛丕华、胡子昂、毕鸣岐、乐松生、陈经畬、黄长水、胡厥文等二十八人。他们认真地分析了章乃器错误言论的严重性，指出了发表联合指示的必要。
    乐松生发言说：章乃器反社会主义的言论已经发生了很坏的影响。北京工商界短期讲习班里有些学员已受到了迷惑，错误地认为章的意见是代表工商界人士的思想。有一个组的学员甚至不愿再接受思想改造了，说什么资产阶级两面性的看法是教条主义。我认为工商界人士应该学习最近人民日报的有关社论，辨明是非，给章乃器的反动思想以恨恨地批评。
    胡子昂说：章乃器的错误不是偶然的。去年民建会二中全会上，大家对他的错误曾进行过帮助和劝告。最近我还同他进行了争论，但他一直坚持错误的观点。“脱胎换骨”本来是形容资产阶级思想改造的很形象的比喻，章却引用成“抽筋剥皮”，以危言耸听。重庆一些工商界人士又给加上“只有第二辈子作好人了”的结论，很不利于改造工作。胡子昂认为：工商业者的思想改造正处在“瓜将熟；水将到”的时候，章乃器认为，现在资产阶级分子同工人阶级分子已经没有区别了，这是摘未熟的瓜，拆水还没流到的渠。这就是取消资产阶级的思想改造。因此，我们应该对这种错误思想给予严肃的斗争，不能让它流传开来。
    苗海南说：章乃器的言论在工商界中已引起了坏的影响，工商联领导上应该赶快起来加以驳斥。我们一方面要赶快写文章、发指示，澄清工商界的思想。另一方面，大家再对章乃器进行一次同志式的帮助。
    朱继圣说：在这次帮助党整风中，最使人不满意的，是章乃器等借机向共产党进行攻击。我们不能接受反社会主义的言论。章乃器针对我们资产阶级有动摇性的弱点，向我们灌输资本主义思想。章认为资产阶级和工人阶级没有不同，资产阶级的两面性已不存在，工人阶级也有两面性等言论，都是在制造工商界的思想混乱，借机贩卖他的资本主义思想。我们要批判章的言论，同时还要继续帮助党整风。
    王光英揭露了章乃器所运用的阴谋手法。他说：从章乃器发表的文章中，可以看出他的阴谋鬼计有：一、给同他辩驳的人乱扣帽子，说他们是教条主义者；二、打、拉的战术，拉李康年、毕鸣岐，打击积极分子；三、他的言论是挂羊头卖狗肉。文章开头引毛主席的话，下面贩卖他自己的思想。他是一贯贩运官盐加私盐，手腕很巧妙。他毒辣地想把革命的阶级观点推翻，把马列主义的理论基础推翻。他说工人阶级也有两面性，就是要神化资产阶级，魔化工人阶级。
    陈经畬说：章乃器在反对教条主义的幌子下，进行反对社会主义的活动。他不但是给工商界帮倒忙，而是在陷害我们。章乃器是全国工商联副主任委员，又是民建领导人，有些工商界人士相信他的话，我认为对他的思想加以驳斥很重要。只有对他的思想逐一加以分析，才能达到教育工商界的目的。
    买买提尼牙兹哈热说：我们的目的是建设社会主义，我认为离开社会主义的言论和行为应该严厉加以制止。我们工商界要走社会主义的道路，任何人都不能使我们离开这个光明的道路。我希望民建总会和全国工商联早些把指示发下去，表示我们的意见。
    毕鸣岐说：王光英说章乃器拉我。我要说明，我的思想和章乃器的思想不同。我的思想是要加强资产阶级思想改造，走社会主义道路，他的思想则是要把我们拉回到资本主义道路上去。他说资产阶级无两面性，我说有。我说定息是剥削，他说不是。他同意李康年定息二十年的意见，我不同意李的意见。他说资产阶级没有了，我说还存在。我要走社会主义的路，他要走资本主义的路，他和我是有本质上的不同。章乃器拉不拉我是他的事，我有我的思想。
    李烛尘说：章乃器的思想，是原则性的错误。这次暴露了他的思想体系。他的思想体系是反社会主义的。这次应尽量地、无情地加以批判。
