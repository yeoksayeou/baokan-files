　　An Important Lesson
　　Zhang Jie
　　Ugly words like "threatening letter" have not been seen or heard for a long time. This is no small matter in our country's political life. This is one of the clear signs of the people's liberation and the basic elimination of counter-revolutionary elements, and it is the glory of the new society. However, if we think that everyone in the new society is pure and flawless, without any dirty blood left over from the old society, and that we don't need any vigilance, and even the concept of friend and foe can be discarded, that is a dangerous idea. The news that Lu Yuwen received a threatening letter is a wake-up call.

　　Of course, we are not neurotic. We will never be frightened by this. How can a dirty stone thrown from the dark damage the progress of 600 million people? However, at a time when anti-socialist thoughts are "restoring" in the minds of many people in various forms, the significance of this threatening letter in terms of ideological education is not small.

　　Anyone who has lived through the old society remembers the "most shameless" things like threatening letters, right? We can't help but think of Chiang Kai-shek's dynasty's civil and military achievements: secret agents were everywhere, running rampant, using both overt and covert means, and doing all kinds of evil. A short article that slipped through the net could be exchanged for a threatening letter, and sometimes even a time bomb; a few speeches could attract American-made silenced pistols. The fresh blood of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo is still fresh in our memory. History is the best teacher, and today's young people should know how their predecessors lived.

　　True, we are in a brand new historical period. But the death of the old society is different from the death of an individual, and we cannot isolate its corpse. It is rotting in our new society, spreading germs. When we are cleaning up the base and building skyscrapers, we have to carry out necessary anti-virus and disinfection work. If anyone thinks that this will hinder his "democracy" and "freedom", there is no way, because no one has the right to cancel other people's freedom to prevent and disinfect. Our socialist democracy and freedom were exchanged for by the long-term bloody struggle of the broad masses of the people. Don't we have the freedom to defend them and develop them?

　　There is no doubt that people of flesh and blood always have shortcomings and inevitably make mistakes. And as far as our "anti-virus" and "disinfection" work is concerned, how can there be no shortcomings and mistakes. We are responsible for them, and we will never push them to the "corpse" of the old society. We are carrying out extensive criticism and self-criticism, and we are doing it very right and very well. And one of the proofs that we are "doing it very right and very well" is the threatening letter written to Lu Yuwen, which once again proves to the people of the whole country in the new situation: who are the real pioneers and developers of democratic and free life, and who are its incurable enemies!

　　The People's Daily editorial on the threatening letter on June 8 asked: "Why is this?" I believe that all upright people can answer this question. A short threatening letter has taught us all an important lesson!

    “恐吓信”之类的丑恶词儿，很久没有看到、听到了。在我国的政治生活中，这不是一件小事。这是人民解放、反革命分子基本肃清的鲜明标志之一，是新社会的荣耀。然而如果以为新社会中个个人玉洁冰清，没有一点旧社会遗留下来的污血，用不着任何警惕，甚至连敌我观念都不妨丢开，那是危险的想法。卢郁文接到恐吓信的消息便是警钟。
    自然，我们不是神经衰弱者。我们决不会因此而惊吓。从暗地里丢来的肮脏石子，何损于六亿人民的前进步伐。然而在反社会主义思想以各种形式在不少人的脑子里“复辟”的时候，这封恐吓信在思想教育方面的意义倒是不小的。
    凡是从旧社会生活过来的人，都记得恐吓信之类的“无耻之尤”吧。我们不得不想起蒋介石王朝的文治武功：特务如毛，横行霸道，明枪暗箭，无恶不作。一篇漏网短文可以换得一封恐吓信，有时还可以换得一颗定时炸弹；几句演说词可以招来美造无声手枪。李公朴、闻一多的鲜血，记忆犹新。历史是最好的老师，今天的青、少年们应该知道自己的先辈是怎样生活过来的。
    不错，我们正处在一个崭新的历史时期。但旧社会的死亡不同于个人的逝世，我们无法隔离它的尸体。它就在我们的新社会中腐烂着，散布着毒菌。我们在打扫基地，建设高楼大厦的时候，不得不进行必要的防毒、消毒工作。如果有谁以为这要妨碍他的“民主”和“自由”，那也没有法子，因为谁也无权取消别人防毒、消毒的自由。我们的社会主义的民主和自由是广大人民用长期的流血斗争换来的，难道没有保卫它们、发展它们的自由？
    毫无问题，有血有肉的人总是有缺点，难免犯错误的。而就我们的“防毒”、“消毒”工作来说，又何尝没有缺点和错误。我们对它们负责，决不会把它们推给旧社会的“尸体”。我们正在开展广泛的批评和自我批评，我们做得很对、很好。而“做得很对、很好”的证据之一，便是写给卢郁文的那封恐吓信，它在新情况下又一次向全国人民证明了：谁是真正的民主和自由生活的开辟者和发展者，谁是它的不可救药的敌人！
    6月8日人民日报关于那封恐吓信的社论问道：“这是为什么？”我相信一切正直的人都能回答这个问题。一封短短的恐吓信，给我们大家上了重要的一课！
