Study Chairman Mao's Report Well, Draw a Clear Line with the Rightists
Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party Chen Qiyou

　　On June 19th, Beijing newspapers published Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This article analyzes in detail and correctly twelve fundamental issues existing in our country's revolutionary practice and on the ideological front, and provides correct principles for how to handle these issues. This is a brilliant development of Marxism and a fundamental guide for us in handling internal problems among the people. I fully endorse all the instructions made by Chairman Mao in this article.

　　In accordance with the spirit of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the needs of the current domestic objective situation, the Chinese Communist Party first launched a rectification movement within the Party, and invited the democratic parties to offer opinions to help the Party rectify its work, while implementing the policy of rectifying while correcting. This demonstrates the great, selfless essence of the Chinese Communist Party, which wholeheartedly serves the people, is humble and willing to learn, and corrects its mistakes. As members of the democratic parties and citizens of the People's Republic of China, we should, with the intention of cherishing the Party and for the benefit of the people of the whole country, and to accelerate the progress of socialist construction, sincerely offer opinions to help the Party improve its work, so that the Party can better lead and unite our people to move towards socialism and even communism. However, at a time when the people of the whole country are actively involved in the rectification movement, some ambitious people have taken the opportunity to express various reactionary remarks that are hostile to the Party, slander the Party, and completely contrary to the common will of the people of the whole country. The so-called: "Political Design Institute," "Rehabilitation Committee," "Party's World," "The dictatorship of the proletariat is the root of the three major evils," "China would not perish without the Communist Party," and other absurd fallacies, although expressed differently, their essence, when inferred to the end, is to oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose the socialist system. Are the people who say these things ignorant? No, they are people with a certain status, they are not ignorant, but intentional. It is intentional to sabotage, which is intolerable. We must give these alarming fallacies a merciless rebuff, resolutely draw a political and ideological line with them, and never allow them to become arrogant and hinder the healthy progress of the rectification movement.

　　I personally participated in the old democratic revolution. Although the people who participated in the revolution at that time were not without loyal and ardent people who sacrificed everything for the revolution, the result was still a failure. Later, with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people was able to win victory after victory and have today's prosperity and happiness. The people of the whole country have long chosen "to resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." We have formed a blood-and-flesh relationship with the Communist Party, and we have formed an inseparable whole with the socialist system. No one can shake the confidence of our people in supporting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and resolutely taking the socialist road. All fallacies will be crushed under the common will of the people of the whole country. All rightists who do not thoroughly confess will also be spurned by the people of the whole country.

　　Non-proletarian and non-socialist ideological consciousness also exists, more or less, among the members of our Zhi Gong Party, which hinders the development of our work. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Zhi Gong Party and the Administrative Council made a decision on June 18th to carry out a rectification movement within the Zhi Gong Party. Every member of our Zhi Gong Party must earnestly study this great document and actively participate in this movement, in order to correct our thinking, draw a clear line with the rightists, and through this movement, strengthen our class stand and work together with the people of the whole country for the socialist cause.

　　好好学习毛主席的报告，同右派分子划清界限
    中国致公党主席　陈其尤
    6月19日北京各报都刊载了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文章，这篇文章，详尽而正确地分析了目前在我国存在着的革命实践中和思想战线上的十二个根本性的问题，并作出了如何处理这些问题的正确原则。这是马克思主义的光辉发展，是我们处理人民内部问题的根本指针。我完全拥护毛主席在这篇文章中所作出的各项指示。
    根据“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的精神，和目前国内客观形势的需要，中国共产党首先展开了党内的整风运动，并邀约各民主党派向党提意见帮助党整风，并且贯彻着边整边改的方针。这说明中国共产党全心全意为人民、虚怀若谷、知过必改的大公无私的伟大实质。作为民主党派的成员和中华人民共和国的公民，应该本着爱护党，和一切为全国人民的利益，为加速社会主义建设的前进，而善意地提出意见，以帮助党改进工作，以便党更好地来领导和团结我们全国人民走向社会主义以至共产主义。可是，在全国人民积极投入整风运动的时候，竟有些别具野心的人乘机发表了各种敌视党、诬蔑党、和与全国人民的共同意志完全违背的反动言论。所谓：“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“党天下”、“无产阶级专政是三大害的根源”、“没有共产党中国也不会亡”等等无稽谬论，尽管说法不同，但它们的实质推论到最后都是反对党的领导和反对社会主义制度。说这些话的人是不是无知呢？不是的，他们都是有一定地位的人，他们不是无知，而是有意。有意来破坏，是可忍孰不可忍。我们必须对这些危言谬论给予无情回击，坚决和它们划清政治和思想界限，绝不能让他们嚣张起来而阻碍整风运动的健康进展。
    我个人曾参加过旧民主革命，虽然参加当时革命的人，不乏忠贞热血之士，为革命牺牲一切，但结果仍然失败了。后来有了中国共产党的领导，中国人民的革命事业才能胜利接着胜利地而有了今天的繁荣幸福。全国人民早已选择定了“在中国共产党的领导下，坚决走社会主义的道路”。我们已和共产党产生了血和肉的关系，我们已和社会主义制度形成了不可分的无隙整体，谁也不能动摇我们全国人民拥护中国共产党的领导和坚决走社会主义道路的信心，所有谬论一定会在全国人民的共同意志下被粉碎。一切右派分子若不彻底交代，亦将为全国人民所唾弃。
    非无产阶级的、非社会主义的思想意识，在我们致公党的成员中，也或多或少的存在着，这是有碍于我们工作的开展的。因此，致公党中央常务委员会行政会6月18日已作出了在致公党内进行整风的决定，我们致公党的每一成员必须认真地好好学习这一伟大文件并积极参加这一运动，以求端正思想，同右派分子划清界限，并通过这一运动坚定阶级立场，与全国人民一道为社会主义事业而共同奋斗。
