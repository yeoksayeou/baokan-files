    The Common Market and the French Working People
    Li Ninglai
    Since the six Western European countries signed the European Common Market Treaty in Rome at the end of March, some of the French capitalists who most vigorously promoted this plan seem to be satisfied. It is not that they did not see that joining the Common Market meant that French capitalists were further surrendering to the large capitalists of West Germany. However, with the good opportunity to seize money in front of them, what do the interests and future of their own country matter!

    A market with more than 160 million consumers (the total population of the six countries joining the Common Market) is a huge market. This is indeed an ideal for West German commodities, which have low cost prices and are eager to find export markets, but for French commodities, which have high costs and are difficult to compete with West German commodities, it will suffer tragic consequences. However, the French capitalists have their own ideas: the difficulties encountered in the export of French goods can be used as a reason to lower workers' wages; the devaluation of the franc is still an opportunity to make a fortune; and the future squeezing out and collapse of small industrial enterprises, and the further concentration of industry, can bring them many benefits.

    However, the French working people firmly oppose the Common Market, because they understand that the Common Market will bring disastrous consequences to their country, and at the same time they will be the first victims of this consequence.

    According to the provisions of the Common Market Treaty, the tax legislation and social legislation of the member states must be leveled, which means that the living standards of French workers will be greatly reduced compared with the present. Compared with the West German level, French workers' wages will be reduced by 20% to 30%.

    The monthly wage of a gas worker in West Germany is almost only half of the wage of the same worker in France.

    Workers in West Germany often have to work overtime. Overtime pay is equivalent to 10.23% to 50% of the original salary. In France, it is an increase of 25.5% to 100%. For example, overtime on Sundays is an increase of 50% of the daily wage in West Germany, and 100% in France.

    Coal miners in West Germany have to work in the mines until they are sixty years old, while the same workers in France retire much earlier. If leveled, French coal miners will have to work for ten more years before they can retire.

    As for the taxes paid by workers, a West German worker needs to pay 20% to 30% more taxes than the same worker in France.

    In terms of rent, half of West German working families need to pay one-third of their income for rent. The rent in West Germany is 25% to 30% higher than for similar houses lived in by French workers.

    The industrialists in West Germany have also estimated that the Common Market will bring huge disasters to the French working people. Bernhard Lavergne mentioned in the "Financial Daily" on January 11 this year that French workers may flee to Germany after the establishment of the Common Market: "The decline of French industry and the resulting unemployment have already been anticipated by the Germans. A German industrial magnate recently said to his German friends in Paris: The Common Market will rapidly affect all French industries... This industrialist revealed that his colleagues are already drafting plans to build housing in the Rhine region... to accommodate one and a half million French workers and their families."

    This is the initial benefit that the French working people will get from the Common Market. Former French Prime Minister Mollet said in a speech to the National Assembly that "(The Common Market) Treaty is a tool for social progress." From the above analysis, it is not difficult to understand who this sentence represents.

    共同市场与法国劳动人民
    李宁来
    自从3月底，西欧六国在罗马签订了欧洲共同市场条约以来，鼓吹这个计划最有力的一些法国资本家似乎感到心满意足了。他们也不是没有看到，加入共同市场就意味着法国的资本家进一步向西德的大资本家们投降。可是面前摆着攫取金钱的好机会，自己国家的利益和前途算得了什么！
    一个拥有一亿六千余万消费者（加入共同市场的六国人口总数）的市场是一个巨大的市场，这对成本价格不高，正急于找寻出口市场的西德商品来说，确实是一个理想，但是对于成本高、难以与西德商品抗衡的法国商品说来，却会遭受到悲惨的后果。可是法国的大资本家们有他们的想法：法国商品输出遭遇困难，正可用来做为降低工人工资的理由；法郎贬值还是一个发财的机会；而将来小工业企业被排挤而纷纷倒闭，工业进一步集中更可给他们带来许多好处。
    然而法国的劳动人民却坚决反对共同市场，因为他们了解，共同市场将给自己的国家带来灾难性后果，同时他们自己也将是这一后果的首先的牺牲品。
    按共同市场条约中规定，成员国的捐税立法和社会立法要拉平，这就意味着法国的工人生活水平将比现在大大的降低。和西德水平相较，法国工人工资将被降低20％至30％。
    西德的一个煤气工人的每月工资几乎只达到法国同样工人工资的半数。
    西德的工人常常要加班。加班费相当于原薪的10.23％至50％。而在法国是增加25.5％至100％。例如星期日加班，在西德是增加当日工资的50％，而在法国是100％。
    西德的煤矿工人到了六十岁还要下井工作，而法国的同样工人早得多就退休了。如果拉平的话，法国的煤矿工人要多劳动十年才能退休。
    至于工人所缴纳的捐税，一个西德工人所需缴纳的捐税要比法国同样工人高出20％至30％。
    在房租方面，西德有一半工人家庭需将收入的三分之一付房租费。和法国工人所住的同类住宅，在西德租价要高25％至30％。
    共同市场将给法国劳动人民带来巨大灾难，这一点连西德的工业家也估计到了。伯纳·拉维尔涅在今年1月11日的“金融日报”上提到在共同市场建立后法国工人可能流亡德国时写道：“法国工业的衰颓以及因而产生的失业已经在德国人的预计之中。有一个德国工业巨子最近在巴黎对他的德国朋友们说：共同市场将迅速影响法国一切工业……这个工业家透露：他的同行们已经在拟定计划，要在莱因河流域建造住房……来收容一百五十万法国工人和他们的眷属。”
    这就是法国的劳动人民将从共同市场获得的初步好处。法国前总理摩勒在国民议会发言中曾说“（共同市场）条约是社会进步的工具。”从以上分析来看，这是一句代表谁讲的话，就不难明白了。
