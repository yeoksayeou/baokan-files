International Notes

    Zoli's "Joke"
    Italian Prime Minister Zoli recently told a "joke" in parliament: "The vote of confidence has obviously been lost."
    According to Western news agency reporters who witnessed the scene: On the evening of May 29, when Zoli addressed both houses of parliament requesting a vote of confidence for his policy platform, he was met with ridicule and questions. The questioning was so incessant that the 69-year-old Christian Democrat had to stop speaking. He drank a glass of water to mask the embarrassing moment, then returned to the microphone and said: "The vote of confidence has obviously been lost."
    Powerful figure, Foreign Minister Pella, shook his head, disagreeing with this blunt statement.
    Zoli said seriously: "I was telling a joke."
    It seems that Zoli, who is described as "lacking charisma," is not experienced enough in Italian politics, resulting in such an embarrassing situation in parliament. As a result, under the "head-shaking" signal of the veteran politician, he uttered such a "joke" to ease the embarrassment.
    But compared to those cunning and sly politicians, Zoli seems a little more "honest." His "the vote of confidence has obviously been lost" "joke" also expressed his "sincere feelings."
    From the moment Zoli began to form an exclusively Christian Democratic government, his position was very unstable. When he published his policy platform, expressing that he would continue to follow the United States and continue to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in foreign affairs; and announced a program similar to that implemented by recent Italian governments in domestic affairs, the opposition from all sides became even greater. The Italian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Republican Party, from the left to the center-right, all did not support him. At that time, Zoli faced a choice: either step down and invite someone more capable, or rely on the support of the far-right neo-fascists and monarchists to survive. Zoli chose the latter path.
    But this caused new turmoil. Just as Zoli was conducting a confidence debate in the Senate, one of Zoli's own Christian Democratic leaders, Scelba, proposed that if the Zoli government came to power solely on the support of right-wing parties, he should resign. In this way, although Zoli obtained a slight majority in the Senate with the help of the votes of the two far-right parties, as foreign news agencies said, what followed was, in addition to the existing difficulties, "the greatest difficulty from dissatisfied members of his own Christian Democratic Party." Many Christian Democrats were dissatisfied with Zoli's desperate approach, fearing that forming an alliance with the notoriously fascist and national monarchists would cause their party to lose votes in the general election next spring, and this party cannot afford to lose any more votes.
    From this point of view, Zoli's "joke" has serious significance. (Sheng)

### 佐利的“笑话”

    佐利的“笑话”
    意大利新任总理佐利不久前在议会里说了一句“笑话”，那就是：“信任票显然已经失去了”。
    据目击当时情景的西方通讯社记者报道：5月29日晚当佐利在议会两院要求给以信任而发表政纲演说时，受到别人的讥笑和质问。质问声一度持续不断，使这位六十九岁的天主教民主党人只得停止发言。他喝了一杯水，借以掩饰这个窘困的时刻，然后回到播音器前说：“信任票显然已经失去了”。
    强有力人物、外交部长贝拉摇了摇头，不同意这种直率的说法。
    佐利严肃地说：“我是说笑话。”
    看来，这个被称为“缺少吸引人的魅力”的佐利在意大利政界混得还不够老练，以致在议会里窘态毕露。结果在老牌政客“摇头”示意下又说出了这么一句“笑话”来聊以解嘲。
    但是和那些老奸巨滑的政客比较起来，佐利又似乎稍微“老实”一些。他的“信任票显然已经失去了”的这句“笑话”倒也表现了他的“由衷之情”。
    从佐利开始筹组清一色的天主教民主党政府时起，他的处境就很不稳。及至他发表了施政纲领，对外表示依然要跟美国走，继续支持北大西洋公约集团；对内则宣布了一项同意大利最近几届政府所执行的类似的纲领。各方面的反对就更大了。意大利共产党、社会党、社会民主党、自由党和共和党等从左翼到中间偏右这一片都不支持他。当时，佐利面临着这样一个抉择，或者是下台，另请高明；或者依靠极右派的新法西斯党人和保皇党的支持而图幸存。佐利选择了后面的道路。
    但是这又引起了新的风波。正当佐利在上议院进行信任辩论时，佐利自己的天主教民主党领导人之一谢尔巴提出：如果佐利政府仅仅靠右翼党派的支持而上台，他就应该辞职。这样，佐利虽然在上议院借助两个极右党派的票而取得了微弱的多数，但是正像外国通讯社说的，随之而来的却是在现有的各种困难外，又“碰到来自他自己的天主教民主党的感到不满的党员的最大困难”。许多天主教民主党人不满意佐利这种孤注一掷的作法，他们担心，同声名极臭的法西斯派和国家保皇党人结成联盟，会使他们的党在明年春天的大选中失去选票，而这个党是经不起再失去更多票的。
    从这一点看来，佐利的“笑话”倒是具有严肃的意义。（生）
