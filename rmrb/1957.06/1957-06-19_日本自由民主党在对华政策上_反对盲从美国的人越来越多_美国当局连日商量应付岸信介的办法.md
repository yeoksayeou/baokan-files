Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: Sources close to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party's Foreign Affairs Research Council said yesterday that after Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States, the ruling party will ask him to comprehensively consider Japan's policy toward China.

These sources said that within the Liberal Democratic Party, an increasing number of people believe that if Japan continues to blindly follow the United States on the issue of China, Japan will fall behind. They believe that the time is coming for Japan to study its policy toward China "as one of its most pressing issues."

It is revealed that policymakers in the Liberal Democratic Party generally believe that Nobusuke Kishi should convey Japan's views to the United States in order to improve the international situation related to China. They believe that although the time for recognizing China has not yet arrived, trade with China should be expanded.

These sources believe that later this year, the China issue will become an important issue in international politics. They also pointed out that, since Japan has officially restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the number of people within the Liberal Democratic Party who believe that Japan cannot forever refuse to establish diplomatic relations with China is rapidly increasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, Under Secretary of Defense Quarles, and others held a meeting yesterday. State Department spokesman White announced after the meeting that the meeting discussed "issues that may be raised during Nobusuke Kishi's visit." Prior to this, U.S. government officials had held a series of preparatory meetings for Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States.

Nobusuke Kishi arrived in San Francisco on the afternoon of the 17th (local time) and will arrive in Washington on the morning of the 19th. During the three-day U.S.-Japan talks, he will discuss with U.S. government leaders issues concerning Japan's military expansion, including the U.S.-Japan "security system," as well as U.S.-Japan cooperation in developing Southeast Asia, relaxing the embargo on China, and the status of Okinawa. The Japanese Prime Minister not only brought Japan's long-term military expansion plan, the "Basic Policy for National Defense," but also a 30-page white paper on the organizational situation of the Japanese Communist Party as "reference material" for the talks.

　　日本自由民主党在对华政策上
　　反对盲从美国的人越来越多
　　美国当局连日商量应付岸信介的办法
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：接近日本自由民主党外交调查会的人士昨天说，日本执政党将在岸信介访问美国以后，要求他通盘考虑日本对中国的政策。
    这些人士说，自由民主党内部有越来越多的人认为，如果日本在对待中国的问题上继续盲目地跟着美国走，日本将会落后。他们认为，日本必须把对中国的政策“当作它的最迫切的问题之一”来加以研究的时机正在到来。
    据透露，自由民主党的政策制定者们普遍认为，岸信介应该把日本的上述看法告诉美国，以便改善与中国有关的国际局势。他们认为，虽然现在还不到承认中国的时候，但是应该扩大同中国的贸易。
    这些人士认为，在今年晚些时候，中国问题将成为国际政治中的重要问题。他们并且指出，由于日本已经同苏联正式恢复邦交，自由民主党内认为日本不能永远拒绝同中国建立邦交的人正在迅速增多。
    据新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、国防部副部长卡利斯等人昨天举行了会议。国务院发言人怀特在会后宣布，这次会议讨论了“岸信介访问期间可能提出的问题”。在此以前，美国政府官员曾经为岸信介访美问题举行了一系列的准备会议。
    岸信介已经在17日下午（当地时间）到达旧金山，并且将在19日上午到达华盛顿。在为期三天的日美会谈中，他将同美国政府首脑讨论关于包括日美“安全体制”问题在内的日本扩军问题，以及日美合作开发东南亚、放宽对中国的禁运和关于冲绳岛的地位等问题。这位日本首相不仅携带了日本的长期扩军计划、“国防基本方针”，并且携带了一份长达三十页的关于日本共产党组织状况的白皮书，作为会谈中的“参考资料”。
