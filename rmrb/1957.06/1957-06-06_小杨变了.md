    Little Yang Has Changed

    It was the postman, Little Yang, who delivered our mail for this stretch. Usually, he would deliver mail in a huff, throwing the letters down and leaving. The root cause, when traced, was that he didn't want to do this menial job: "My dad made me study for nine years, painstakingly getting me through junior high school, and today I'm still just a small-time mail carrier!"
    However, in the past few days, he has suddenly changed. He is amiable and talkative with people. Filled with curiosity, I asked: "Little Yang, do you like doing this job now?" "Our bureau chief is an old revolutionary who has worked for one or two decades, and now he delivers mail with a mailbag just like me, so how can I not do it!"

    小杨变了
    送我们这一段信的是邮递员小杨。平日，他送信总是气呼呼的，信一扔就走。追根究源，原来是他不愿干这低人一等的行当：“我爹给我念了九年书，辛辛苦苦的弄个初中毕业，到今天还当个小小的投递员！”
    可是，这几天他却突然变了。对人和言悦色，有说有笑。我抱着一股好奇心问道：“小杨，乐意干这一行了吗？”“我们局长干了一、二十年的老革命，现在也和我一样背着邮包送信，我又怎么不能干呢！”
