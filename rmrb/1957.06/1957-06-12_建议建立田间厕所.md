    Suggestion to Build Field Latrines
    More and more women are participating in field labor, which is a good thing. However, when women are working in the fields and need to relieve themselves, they have to run to a faraway place or go back home, which takes half an hour or even more than an hour each time. This not only affects production but is also very tiring. This is a problem worth noting.
    In fact, this problem is not too difficult to solve. Just use old mats or bamboo curtains (reed or sorghum stalk curtains are also acceptable) to enclose a large cylinder on the edge of the field, and it will be a very economical and practical temporary latrine. After using it, it can be rolled up and taken home for future use. It is suggested that agricultural cooperatives in various places try it out. Wang Ruoqi

    建议建立田间厕所
    妇女们参加田间劳动的多起来了，这是好事情。可是，妇女们在地里干活的时候，要大小便，必须跑到很远的地方或回到家里去，每次需要花费半个钟头甚至一个多钟点的时间。这不仅影响了生产，还跑得很累。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    其实这个问题也并不太难解决。只要用旧席或者竹帘子（苇子、秫秸帘子也可），在地边围成一大圆筒，就是一个很经济、很适用的临时厕所。用完以后，还可以把它卷好，带回家去，以后再用。建议各地农业社试试看。  王若奇
