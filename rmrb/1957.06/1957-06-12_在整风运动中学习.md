Learning in the Rectification Movement
Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for the Rectification Movement, people from all walks of life have actively participated, putting forward many criticisms and opinions. For me, this is a golden learning opportunity.

The Rectification Movement was proposed after the Chinese people's revolution achieved a decisive victory. As a member of a democratic party, I participate in this movement with brotherly enthusiasm and respect. I was not without opinions about the Communist Party in the past, and I have raised them more or less. Now, when the Communist Party humbly and formally asks us for criticism, I have repeatedly considered how to seriously and earnestly deal with this issue.

I raised my opinions at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department, mainly criticizing the United Front Work Department for insufficient concern and assistance in the leadership and ideological remolding work of the democratic parties, and suggested strengthening the work of Communist Party members participating in the democratic parties, hoping that it would pay attention to these issues. I also pointed out instances of what I considered sectarianism at the rectification symposium of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, hoping that the responsible parties would pay attention to correcting them. Some people think that my opinions are not enough, not sharp enough, and suspect that I still have concerns. My answer is: I can only put forward opinions in a manner that seeks truth from facts and cures diseases; I cannot agree with criticizing for the sake of criticizing, pretending, grandstanding, or what some people admire as "the spicier the better."

So far, in the great blooming and contending, many problems have been exposed and many opinions have been put forward. For example, it involves how to strengthen the system, the leadership of the Party and how to coordinate the relationship between the Party and the government, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members, personnel issues, and so on. Most of the opinions are put forward under the principles of not contradicting and consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, not losing the direction of socialist construction, and not harming the interests of the people. I am happy to analyze and study them, and I have gained a lot of knowledge.

Some criticisms and opinions are obviously wrong. For example, some people exaggerate the mistakes of individual Party members into the mistakes of the Party; some people only allow themselves to criticize others and do not allow others to criticize back; some people take the opportunity to exaggerate and shout abuse. The most prominent are opinions that have made serious ideological and principled errors, even political principled errors.

When criticizing, some people do not like the formula of "affirming the advantages and pointing out the shortcomings." When mentioning this formula, they do so in a humorous and ridiculous tone, as if it is a joke with no practical significance. They did not expect that this formula is determined by the superiority of the socialist system. Although simple, it has truth. Criticism cannot but take into account the effect. If only shortcomings are mentioned without mentioning advantages, it is easy to cause misperceptions among the masses, and even be distorted and used by the enemy, causing losses to the Party. They also did not expect that if the advantages that exist in fact are not first affirmed, and then the shortcomings are pointed out, the criticism will not easily convince and be accepted. Why do some people only like to mention shortcomings and not like to mention advantages? The reason for this can only be explored from the depths of their hearts.

It is inappropriate to equate flattery and praising the achievements of the people's cause. Flattery was a shortcut to advancement in the old society, and it often worked; however, today the times have changed, and its market is not so big. Isn't it that some people, because flattery doesn't work, turn around and curse others for flattery? In the great Mao Zedong era, we have seen the Communist Party make many great achievements for the people, such as the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, the comprehensive control of the Huaihe River and the Yellow River, and the construction of the Yangtze River Iron Bridge, all of which were unimaginable by predecessors; why can't we praise them? Achievements should be praised, and mistakes should be criticized, which is fair.

Someone painstakingly used a lot of "beautiful" words to put forward his criticism, eliciting knowing smiles from everyone. After analysis, it turned out to be nothing more than individualism using the opportunity of criticism to express groans, which is not very helpful to others. It should be admitted that since liberation, the Party's assessment and arrangement of non-Party members, especially upper-level non-Party members, has been basically appropriate, because it has seen the whole picture of the problem. But even now, there are still a few people who are not reconciled, not convinced, and have complaints at any time, which is regrettable. I suggest that relevant departments can re-evaluate those people and make new arrangements to satisfy their wishes as much as possible; at the same time, I also suggest that these gentlemen study more, improve more, and do more work, and the people will never fail you.

Here I would like to add my different opinions on Mr. Zhang Xiruo's criticism of the Communist Party's four major deviations. The Communist Party of China is guided by the Marxist theory of historical materialism and dialectical materialism. It has always advocated respecting and critically accepting the great traditional culture of the motherland, and the fact is indeed the case. Mr. Zhang Xiruo said that the Communist Party "despises the past" and does not admit that there was culture in the world before Marx, which is not in accordance with the facts. As for "superstition of the future," in terms of meaning, it is also inappropriate. According to Marxist theory, the Communist Party has a prediction of the future development of human history, including the development of Chinese history. Prediction forms people's ideals, and ideals will one day become reality, which has been fully proven by past historical practice. This kind of ideal and superstition are fundamentally two different things.

Finally, I believe that the Rectification Movement is a movement of seeking truth from facts in criticism and self-criticism; it helps others and helps oneself; while criticizing others, it also tests oneself. What I didn't dare to say before, I say now, and what I didn't dare to argue before, I argue now. This is a good phenomenon. In order to expound the truth and distinguish right from wrong, the better the friends are, the more they should argue. The more they argue, the more progress they make, and the more they argue, the more united they become. It doesn't matter if they blush and argue fiercely. Only by putting the issue of face aside can there be a truly socialist democratic life. I sincerely hope that the Rectification Movement will continue to develop healthily.

### 在整风运动中学习

　　在整风运动中学习
　　中国农工民主党副主席  黄琪翔
    中共中央发出整风运动号召以后，各方人士踊跃参加，提出了不少批评和意见，这对于我来说，是个千载难逢的学习机会。
    整风运动是在中国人民革命取得了决定性胜利以后提出来的。作为民主党派的成员，我怀着兄弟般的热情和敬意来参加这一运动。我过去不是对共产党没有意见的，也曾或多或少地提出过。现在，当共产党虚心地正式要求我们批评的时候，我反复地考虑过应如何认真严肃地来对待这一问题。
    我在统战部召集的座谈会中提了意见，主要是批评统战部对民主党派的领导工作和思想改造工作关心不够和帮助不够，并且建议要加强参加民主党派的共产党员的工作等，希望它重视这些问题。我也在国家体委的整风座谈会上指出了我认为是宗派主义的事例，希望负责方面加以注意改正。有人认为我的意见不够多，不够尖锐，怀疑我是否还有顾虑。我的答复是：我只能以实事求是和治病救人的态度提出意见；为批评而批评、装腔作势、哗众取宠，或者如有些人所欣赏的那样“越辣越好”，我都不敢苟同。
    到现在为止，在大鸣大放中，揭露的问题和提出的意见是不少了。例如涉及到制度的如何加强、党的领导和如何协调党政关系问题、党与非党关系问题、人事问题等等。大多数的意见，是在和巩固共产党的领导不矛盾、不迷失社会主义建设方向，不损害人民利益的原则之下提出来的，我乐意地加以分析研究，得到了不少知识。
    有些批评和意见，显然是错误的，例如：有人把个别党员的错误夸大成为党的错误；有人只许自己批评别人，不许别人反批评，有人借题发挥，叫嚣谩骂。最突出的还有犯了严重的思想原则性错误甚至政治原则性错误的意见。
    在批评的时候，有人不喜欢“肯定优点，指出缺点”的公式，提到这个公式，以一种幽默和滑稽的口吻出之，似乎这是一句笑话，毫无实际意义。他们没有想到，这一公式是社会主义制度的优越性所决定的，虽然简单，却有真理。批评不能不考虑到效果，如果只提缺点而不提优点，就容易在群众中引起错觉，甚至给敌人歪曲利用，造成党的损失。他们也没有想到，如果不首先肯定事实上存在的优点，然后指出缺点，批评就不容易使人心服和接受。为什么有些人只喜欢提缺点而不喜欢提优点呢？这理由只能从他们的内心深处去探求。
    有人把吹牛拍马和歌颂人民事业的成就并提，是不恰当的。吹牛拍马是旧社会的登龙捷径，用之经常有效；但是，今天时代变了，它的市场也就不大了。难道不是有些人因为吹牛拍马不灵转而咒骂别人吹牛拍马吗？在伟大的毛泽东时代，我们看见了共产党替人民立下了许多丰功伟绩，如有目共见的鞍钢、武钢的建设，根治淮河、黄河和筑成长江铁桥等等，都是前人所不敢想像的；为什么不可以歌颂呢？有成就当歌颂，有错误当批评，这才公道。
    有人煞费苦心地用了很多“优美”的词汇提出了他的批评，引得大家发出会心的微笑。一经分析，原来不过是个人主义假借批评的机会发出呻吟，对人帮助不大。应该承认，解放以后，党对党外人士、特别是上层党外人士的估计和安排，基本上是恰当的，因为它看到了问题的全面。但直到现在，还有少数人不甘心，不服气，随时都有怨声，这是令人遗憾的。我建议有关部门可以对那些人重新估价，重作安排，尽量满足他们的愿望；同时，也建议这些先生多学习多提高多做事，人民就决不会辜负你们。
    在这里我想附带对张奚若先生批评共产党的四大偏差提出不同的意见。中国共产党是以历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的马克思主义理论为指导思想的，它从来就主张尊重和批判地接受伟大的祖国传统文化，事实也正是如此。张奚若先生说共产党“鄙视既往”，不承认马克思以前的世界有文化，这是不符合事实的。至于“迷信将来”，在意义上来说，同样是不妥当的。共产党根据马克思主义的理论，对于人类历史发展前途是有预见的，包括中国历史发展在内。预见形成了人们的理想，理想总有一天会成为现实，过去历史实践充分证明了这点。这种理想和迷信根本上是两回事。
    最后，我认为整风运动是一个实事求是的批评和自我批评运动；既帮助别人，又帮助自己；在批评别人的时候，同时也考验自己。以前不敢鸣的现在鸣了，以前不敢争的现在争了，这是一种好现象。为着阐发真理，明辨是非，越是好朋友，越要争辩，越争越进步，越争越团结，面红耳赤，也不要紧。只有能把面子问题摆在一边，才有真正的社会主义的民主生活。我衷心希望整风运动继续健康发展下去。
