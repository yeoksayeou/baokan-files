Adopt a Positive Attitude and Help the Communist Party Rectify its Work from the Desire for Unity
Excerpts from a Speech at the Third Plenary Session of the CPPCC Hunan Provincial Committee
Tang Shengzhi, Standing Committee Member of the CPPCC National Committee and Vice Governor of Hunan Province

Our meeting truly implemented the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," giving people a fresh and inspiring feeling. During the meeting, many members realistically affirmed the achievements in our various tasks, including the achievements in the people's democratic united front work; at the same time, they sincerely and responsibly, sharply and boldly exposed the shortcomings and errors in our various tasks. I think this is a very gratifying phenomenon. Through this meeting, we have promoted and cultivated a democratic atmosphere of boldly putting forward different opinions and criticisms, which is a concrete sign of the increasingly active people's democratic life in our province.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our province has made brilliant achievements in various tasks. The problem is that while achieving these achievements, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred in our work. We often hear such a formula: "Achievements are fundamental, shortcomings are serious, and also inevitable." It seems that such a statement and formula are indeed in line with objective reality. But unfortunately, such a statement and formula still lack sufficient persuasive power, because doing a good job, completing tasks, and achieving achievements are the bounden duties of all revolutionary workers; one must never shirk one's due political responsibility just because shortcomings and errors are inevitable. In fact, many shortcomings and errors can be largely avoided if we can consider things more carefully and cautiously before and during the deployment of work. Even if mistakes are made, the degree can be greatly reduced.

Now, I would like to express some personal views on the issue of "letting go" and "contending." Please criticize me if I am wrong.

Only Rectification Can Properly Handle Internal Contradictions; Only Exposing Contradictions Can Promote the Rectification Movement

First, I think that correctly understanding and correctly handling contradictions among the people are closely related to the new rectification movement launched by the Communist Party of China within the Party to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Only when the Communist Party launches a rectification movement can it better handle contradictions among the people; and only by fully exposing contradictions in all aspects among the people can the Communist Party's rectification movement be promoted. Originally, the CPC planned to carry out rectification next year, but now it is carrying it out ahead of schedule and using the united front to promote rectification. I think this is the reason. Because if a large number of contradictions are exposed, and the Communist Party does not carry out rectification, these contradictions cannot be properly handled. "When a bird sings, it seeks a friendly voice." From this perspective, especially from the perspective of the Communist Party using the united front to help rectification, all of us non-Party comrades should assume an unshirkable responsibility to boldly and sincerely offer opinions to the Communist Party.

Helping the Communist Party to Rectify is to Consolidate the Party's Leadership and to Distinguish Right from Wrong

Second, "letting go" and "contending" are carried out on the fronts of literature and art and scientific academia, and on the fronts of political thought. Everyone knows everything and says everything, exposing shortcomings, pointing out errors, and helping the Communist Party to rectify its work. This belongs to the latter category. This kind of "letting go" and "contending" should have a clear purpose, which is: to cherish and love the Party; to consolidate the Party's leadership; to distinguish right from wrong. Many of us have a common feeling: the correct leadership of the Communist Party is the fundamental guarantee of our happiness. Our lives, our children and grandchildren, the socialist future of our 600 million people all rely on the strong, correct, and wise leadership of the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, or if the leadership is not strong and effective, or if the leadership is not quite correct, we will take many detours, make many mistakes, and the arrival of a happy life will be delayed. Our purpose in helping the Communist Party to rectify its work is to hope that the Party will be stronger, healthier, more prosperous, and more united, and better lead us in building socialism. I think the heartfelt wishes of all of us in putting forward criticisms and opinions are for this purpose. If we deviate from this purpose, it may lead to a negative phenomenon of "gloating over misfortune" and draw the dangerous conclusion of abolishing and weakening the Party's leadership. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, adopted in 1954, affirmed the leadership of the Communist Party over state affairs. Chairman Mao pointed out affirmatively at the time that "the core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out once again when meeting with representatives of the Youth League that "the Communist Party of China is the core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the socialist cause cannot be victorious." All these profound instructions should be remembered forever and firmly by us.

The Tense Relationship Between the Party and Non-Party Members in Some Occasions is Complex, and Cannot be Entirely Attributed to the Party's Sectarianism

Third, I think the meanings of party and sect should be distinguished. We now have a multi-party coexistence system, implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The political party of the working class and the democratic parties all serve socialism, but each has its own class nature or represents a certain class. There are similarities and differences. There are naturally political boundaries here, and these boundaries cannot and should not be blurred. This kind of political boundary will not only not alienate the Communist Party from the democratic parties, but on the contrary, it will help the Communist Party and the democratic parties to divide labor and cooperate, and more effectively play the role of the Party's leadership and the mutual supervision between the Party and the democratic parties. Sectarianism, or the tendency to form cliques, is the erroneous ideology and style of work that does not proceed from uniting 600 million people or from uniting 5 million intellectuals. The tense or abnormal relationship between the Party and non-Party members in some occasions is indeed due to sectarianism at work. High walls and deep trenches are the products of sectarianism and should be torn down and filled in. But the tense or abnormal relationship between the Party and non-Party members in some occasions cannot be entirely attributed to the Communist Party's sectarianism. The situation is complex: some are the political boundaries that should exist, but they are "leftist" or rightist" in execution, but they cannot be understood as sectarianism; some are due to the lack of cultivation and experience of some young Communist Party members, insufficient understanding of the situation of non-Party members, and insufficient estimation of their role, and they are afraid of saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong thing, and losing their position when contacting non-Party members, so their attitude is rigid and incompatible; some are institutional problems, such as the confidentiality system, which have not been resolved for a long time; some are due to the fact that some Communist Party members have problems in their consciousness, quality, and style of work, being arrogant, ignoring others, and taking on the role of three-headed and six-armed "omnipotents," not letting people know what they should know, and not letting everyone do what they should do. "It takes two to tango." In addition, some abnormal situations come from the non-Party comrades. I think we should estimate all aspects of the factors. If it is genuine sectarianism, we must resolutely oppose it and help the Communist Party to thoroughly oppose it. If it is not sectarianism, opposing it indiscriminately will be a bit like Don Quixote. I think clarifying these will help us to develop "small democracy" calmly and gently.

We Should Consciously Improve the Relationship Among the People, and Everyone Should Adopt a Positive Attitude Towards the Contradictions Among the People. Contradictions are always two-sided. No matter what kind of relationship, the relationship between the leader and the led, the relationship of cooperation, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the relationship between superiors and subordinates, the relationship between colleagues, etc., there are two aspects. As long as each aspect adopts a positive attitude, the problem is easier to solve. If one truly starts from the desire for unity, that is a positive attitude, and there will be no tension; if one does not start from the desire for unity, that is a negative attitude, which will inevitably cause tension. To resolve contradictions and improve relationships, one must always take the initiative and not wait for others, or wait for the other side.

To Distinguish Right From Wrong, There Must be Criticism and Self-Criticism; There is Criticism, and Counter-Criticism is Allowed

Fourth, exposing and handling contradictions among the people, examining shortcomings, criticizing errors, letting go and contending freely, and helping the Communist Party to rectify its work are, in the final analysis, a matter of distinguishing right from wrong. To distinguish right from wrong, there must be criticism and self-criticism; there is criticism, and counter-criticism is allowed. The Communist Party and its members have undergone a long period of actual struggle, the hail of bullets on the battlefield, the white terror in the white areas, the severe tortures in the courts, and the physical torments in prisons. They have endured all these severe tests, persevered, and finally achieved victory. Therefore, there is no reason to worry that the Communist Party will not be able to withstand criticism. Criticism will only make the Communist Party more consolidated and powerful, and will not make the Communist Party collapse. And only through criticism can we clarify right and wrong. However, when we consider issues, analyze situations, and conduct criticism, we must be realistic, neither obliterating achievements nor relaxing the slightest flaw; neither minimizing shortcomings nor exaggerating them, neither vulgarly praising merits nor overthrowing everything. We must prevent two kinds of one-sidedness: the one-sidedness of dogmatism, only this one, and the one-sidedness of opportunism, a completely dark mass. Although we do not prohibit and restrict one-sidedness, we do not advocate one-sidedness. What we advocate and require is still comprehensiveness, just as we do not prohibit or restrict strikes and class boycotts, but we do not advocate strikes and class boycotts, and what we advocate is opposing bureaucracy. Being objective, being realistic, and restoring its original appearance are the most convincing. Starting from the desire for unity, my understanding is to start from the public, from the 600 million people, and from socialism. If it is contrary to this, it will not solve practical problems. Chairman Mao recently pointed out when meeting with representatives of the Youth League, "Comrades, unite and fight resolutely and bravely for the cause of socialism. All words and actions that deviate from socialism are completely wrong." I think we should remember this instruction.

Demanding that Criticism Not be One-Sided is a Bookish Idea; But We Should Strive for Comprehensiveness and Avoid One-Sidedness as Much as Possible

Fifth, demanding that criticism not be one-sided is a bookish idea. To criticize, to speak, it is difficult to avoid one-sidedness. Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship did not allow people to criticize, and sealed their mouths. Zhang Puquan was scolded, and Mr. Ma Yinchu, Wang Kunlun and others were also suppressed. At that time, it was "patriotism is a crime, and those who speak in whispers are abandoned in the market." Of course, there was no such thing as one-sidedness or comprehensiveness. The Communist Party expands socialist democracy and broadens the channels of speech. This is essentially different from Chiang Kai-shek's approach. Today, we are bathed in the sunshine and rain of democracy, talking freely, joking, scolding, and naturally we may as well do so. But always remember: everything is for consolidating the Party's leadership, everything is for building socialism; always remember: strive for comprehensiveness and avoid one-sidedness as much as possible. Mastering dialectics does take time, it takes a process, but we should make unremitting efforts.

Fellow members, let me repeat a few words here. I support letting go and contending freely; I support long-term letting go and long-term contending. I hope that we will all study hard, let go and contend freely, and I hope that the CPPCC can become a place where everyone can often let go and contend freely. I believe that through the education of this meeting, the contradictions among our people will be handled better, so that people from all walks of life can better play an active role in our national construction and advance our common great socialist cause.

    采取积极态度，从团结愿望出发帮助共产党整风
    在政协湖南省第三次全体会议上的发言摘要
    政协全国委员会常务委员湖南省副省长  唐生智
    我们的会议真正贯彻了大放大鸣的精神，使人有一种清新振奋的感觉。在会议期间，许多委员实事求是地肯定了我们各项工作中的成绩，包括人民民主统一战线工作中的成绩；同时也诚恳负责地，尖锐大胆地揭露了我们各项工作中的缺点和错误。我认为，这是一种十分可喜的现象。通过这次会议，我们提倡和培养了大胆提出不同意见和批评的民主空气，这是我省人民民主生活日趋活跃的具体标志。
    在中国共产党的领导下，我们省内各项工作都有辉煌的成绩，问题是，在取得这些成绩的同时，在我们的工作中也产生了一些缺点和错误。我们常常听到这么一个公式：“成绩是基本的，缺点是严重的，也是难免的。”看来，这样的说法和公式，也的确是和客观实际相符合的。但很可惜，这样的说法和公式，还缺乏充分的说服力量，因为，做好工作，完成任务，取得成绩，是所有革命工作者的天职；绝不能因为缺点和错误在所难免，就推卸了自己应承担的政治责任。事实上，许多缺点和错误，如果我们能够在部署工作前和执行中更多地缜密考虑，谨慎将事，是可以大量避免的。即或犯了错误，程度也是可以大大减轻的。
    现在，我想就放、鸣问题发表一点个人的看法，说得不对，请各位同志批评。
    只有整风，才能处理好内部矛盾；只有揭露矛盾，才能推动整风运动
    第一点，我认为，正确认识和正确处理人民内部矛盾，与中国共产党在党内开展反对官僚主义、反对宗派主义、反对主观主义的新的整风运动有紧密的联系。只有共产党开展一个整风运动，才能更好地处理人民内部矛盾；也只有充分揭露人民内部各方面的矛盾，才能推动共产党的整风运动。原先中共准备明年才整风，现在提前整风，而且利用统一战线形式来推动整风，我想就是这个道理。因为，揭露了大量的矛盾，如果共产党内不进行整风，这大量的矛盾就不可能得到正确的处理。“嘤其鸣矣，求其友声。”从这个角度上来看，特别是从共产党运用统一战线来帮助整风的这个角度上来看，我们所有非党的同志，都应当担负起一种义不容辞的职责，大胆地、诚恳地给共产党提意见。
    帮助共产党整风，是为了巩固党的领导，为了明辨是非
    第二点，放与鸣，一种是在文学艺术和科学学术的战线上开展，另一种是在政治思想战线上开展。大家知无不言，言无不尽，揭露缺点，指出错误，帮助共产党整风，是属于后一个范围，这种放和鸣，应当有一个明确的目的，就是：为了爱护党、热爱党；为了巩固党的领导；为了明辨是非。我们很多人都有一个共同的感觉：共产党的正确领导是我们幸福的根本保证。我们的身家性命，我们的儿孙后代，我们六亿人民的社会主义前途，都依靠共产党的强有力的、正确的、英明的领导。没有共产党的领导，或者领导不是强而有力，或者领导不太正确，我们就要走许多弯路，犯许多错误，幸福生活的到来就要推迟。我们帮助共产党整风，其目的是希望党更强大健康，更兴盛团结，更好地领导我们建设社会主义。我想我们大家提出批评和意见的衷心意愿，都是为了这个目的。如果离开了这个目的，就有可能引来一种“幸灾乐祸”的消极现象，得出取消和削弱党的领导的危险结论。1954年通过的中华人民共和国宪法，肯定了共产党对国家事务的领导，毛主席当时曾肯定地指出，“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”最近，毛主席在接见青年团的代表时又一次指出，“中国共产党是全中国人民的核心，没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”所有这些深刻的指示，是应当为我们永远地、牢牢地记住的。
    党与非党关系在某些场合表现得紧张，其情况很复杂，不能全部归咎于党的宗派主义
    第三点，我认为，党派与宗派的含义应该分清。我们现在是多党共存制，执行“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。工人阶级的政党和各民主党派都为社会主义服务，但又各有其阶级性或代表一定的阶层。有相同处，也有相异处。这里边自然就有政治上的界限，不能够也不应该模糊这一界限。这种政治上的界限，不但不会使共产党与各民主党派疏远隔阂，恰恰相反，它将有助于共产党和各民主党派的分工和协作，更有效地来发挥党的领导作用和党与各民主党派互相监督的作用。宗派或宗派主义，就是不从团结六亿人民出发、不从团结五百万知识分子出发的错误的思想作风。党与非党关系在某些场合表现得紧张或不正常，其中有些的确是宗派主义在作祟，高墙深沟，正是宗派主义的产物，应该拆了它，填了它。但党与非党关系在某些场合表现得紧张或不正常，并不能全部归咎于共产党有宗派主义的毛病。这当中情况很复杂：有些是应当有的政治界限，只是在执行中偏“左”或偏右了一些，但不能理解为宗派主义；有些是由于一部分年青的共产党员修养锻炼不足，对党外人士的情况了解不够，作用估计不足，和非党人士接触时生怕说错了话，做错了事，失掉了立场，所以态度生硬格格不入；有些是制度上的问题，如保密制度等等，长期没有得到解决；有些是由于一部分共产党员在意识上、品质上、作风上有毛病，盛气凌人，目中无人，以三头六臂的“全能者”自任，该让人家了解的事情不让人家了解，该让大家作的事情不放手让大家作。“一个巴掌拍不响”，此外有些不正常情况又是从非党同志这边来的。我觉得要把各方面的因素都估计进去，如果是道地的宗派主义，就要坚决地反，帮助共产党彻底地反；如果不是宗派主义，乱反一气，是会有点唐·吉柯德的味道的。我认为分清了这些，就有助于我们心平气和，和风细雨地开展“小民主”。
    我们应该自觉地把人民内部的关系搞好，对人民内部的矛盾，大家应该采取积极的态度。矛盾总是双方面的，不管是什么关系，领导与被领导关系，合作共事关系，党与非党关系，上级与下级关系，同行的关系等等，都有两个方面，只要每个方面都采取积极的态度，问题就比较容易解决。果真从团结的愿望出发，就是积极态度，就不会紧张；不从团结的愿望出发，就是消极的态度，也势必会造成紧张。解决矛盾，改善关系，总要自己主动，不要等待别人，等待另一方面。
    要明辨是非，就必须有批评和自我批评；有批评，也容许有反批评
    第四点，揭露和处理人民内部矛盾，检查缺点，批判错误，大放大鸣，帮助共产党整风，归根结蒂，是一个明辨是非的问题。要明辨是非，就必须有批评和自我批评；有批评，也容许有反批评。共产党和他的党员，都经过了较长时期的实际斗争，战场上的枪林弹雨，白区的黑色恐怖，法庭的严刑拷打，监狱的肉体折磨，所有这些严酷的考验，他们都承受住了，坚持下来了，最后才取得了胜利。因此，没有任何理由耽心共产党会受不起批评。批评只会使共产党更加巩固强大，不会使共产党垮台。而且也只有通过批评，才能把是是非非，搞得一清二楚。但是，我们在考虑问题、分析情况、进行批评的时候，一定要实事求是，既不抹煞成绩，也不放松白璧上的微瑕；对缺点既不缩小，也不夸大，既不庸俗地歌功颂德，也不要骂倒一切。我们要防止两种片面性：教条主义的片面性，只此一家，机会主义的片面性，黑漆一团。我们虽不禁止和限制片面，但我们不提倡片面，我们提倡的和要求的仍然是全面，正如不禁止限制罢工罢课，但我们不提倡罢工罢课，我们提倡的是反对官僚主义一样。客观的，实事求是的，还他一个本来面目，是最能够服人心的。从团结的愿望出发，我的理解就是从公出发，从六亿人民出发，从社会主义出发。反乎此，就不能解决实际问题。毛主席最近在接见青年团代表时又指出，“同志们，团结起来，坚决地勇敢地为社会主义事业而奋斗。一切离开社会主义的言论行动是完全错误的。”我想我们应当记住这个指示。
    要求批评不带片面性，是书呆子的想法；但应力争全面，力避片面
    第五点，要求批评不带片面性，这是书呆子的想法。要批评，要说话，就很难免片面。蒋介石法西斯专政，不许人家批评，嘴巴上贴封条，张溥泉挨过骂，马寅初、王昆仑先生等也都受过压制，当时是“爱国有罪，偶语者弃市”，当然也就无所谓片面或全面了。共产党扩大社会主义民主，广开言路，这跟蒋介石是本质上不同的两种做法。我们今天沐浴在民主的阳光雨露之中，纵横谈论，嬉笑怒骂，自然也未尝不可以。但总要记住：一切为了巩固党的领导，一切为了建设社会主义；总要记住：力争全面，力避片面。掌握辩证法的确需要时间，需要一个过程，但我们应该作不懈的努力。
    各位委员，我在这里再重复几句，我是拥护大放大鸣；拥护长放长鸣的。希望我们大家认真学习，有放有鸣，希望政协能成为大家经常好放好鸣的场所。我相信通过这次会议的教育，会使得我们人民内部的矛盾处理得更好，使各方面的人都能够在我们的国家建设中更好地发挥积极作用，把我们共同的伟大的社会主义事业向前推进。
