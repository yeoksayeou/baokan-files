　　"February 7th" Old Workers Invite Zhengzhou Workers to Symposium
    Refuting Rightist Slanders with Personal Experience

    (Our dispatch) More than 1,800 workers from various industries in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, at the joint invitation of five old "February 7th" workers, Jiang Haishi, Lin Maoxiang, Li Quande, Liu Tong, and Zheng Guojun, gathered at the "February 7th" Memorial Hall on June 19 to denounce anti-socialist fallacies. Old teacher Wu Linsheng said: "I have lived through thirteen governments, all of which took the capitalist road, resulting in China becoming increasingly poor and weak, and the people's lives becoming increasingly miserable. The People's Republic of China has only been established for eight years, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, its international status has improved, national construction has leaped forward, and the people's lives have gradually improved. This is obvious to all. This proves that only by taking the socialist road can China truly become independent and the people's lives improve." He then refuted Liu Jixue, deputy chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), who said "The poor benefit from the light of the rich, and the rich benefit from the light of heaven." He said that according to Liu Jixue's statement, it seems that it doesn't matter if there is a famine in the old society because the rich will provide "relief," but has he forgotten how many people starved to death in Henan Province during the drought in 1941? If the poor benefit from the light of the rich, it means benefiting from selling land, selling houses, and selling children. I am very angry when I hear this kind of fallacy.
    Wang Erxin, president of the Zhengzhou Municipal Public and Educational Hospital, refuted Chu Anping's "Party's World" fallacy, saying: "There are three municipal hospitals in Zhengzhou, and three non-Party members are serving as presidents, one of whom is me, and I have both position and power. Can this be said to be a 'Party's World'?" Cao Fu'an of the Municipal Commercial Trade Union used vivid facts to refute the fallacies of those who believe that the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature and demand the withdrawal of public representatives. He said: "Some capitalists believe that since public-private partnerships mean the state is responsible for profits and losses, they can still receive fixed interest. Therefore, they are passive in their work, feigning illness, asking for leave, and going to the theater. After the free market was opened, some wanted to withdraw from joint ventures and work independently in order to get rich. Can it be said that the bourgeoisie does not have a dual nature? Is there no need for transformation?"
    Zheng Guojun, an old "February 7th" worker from the "February 7th" era and now a worker at the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's locomotive section, said: Chiang Kai-shek shouted about construction, but where did China build anything during his more than 20 years of rule? After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in just a few years, we built the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Yangtze River Iron Bridge, and the automobile manufacturing plant. Weren't these built under the leadership of the Communist Party? Weren't they made by the hands of the working class? It is certain that it won't work without the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Jiang Haishi, an old "February 7th" worker from the "February 7th" era and now the deputy director of the Zhengzhou "February 7th" Memorial Hall Management Office, listed the anti-socialist statements of Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, Liu Jixue, and others, and said angrily that after listening to what these people said, their purpose is very clear: they are attempting to take advantage of the rectification movement to overthrow the Communist Party and the working class, so that the new China can return to a semi-colonial status. We must unite around the Communist Party and crush all anti-socialist right-wing elements' attacks.

　　“二七”老工人邀请郑州工人座谈
    以切身经历驳斥右派的诬蔑
    本报讯　河南省郑州市各行业一千八百多名职工应“二七”老工人姜海世、林茂湘、李全德、刘桐、郑国钧五人联合邀请，于6月19日在“二七”纪念堂内集会痛斥反社会主义谬论。老教师武林生说：“我经过十三个政府，都是走资本主义道路，结果中国越来越贫弱，人民生活越来越苦。中华人民共和国成立才八年，在共产党的领导下，国际地位提高了，国家建设突飞猛进，人民生活逐渐提高了，这是有目共睹的。这证明只有走社会主义道路才能使中国真正独立，人民生活才能改善。接着他驳斥了民革河南省委员会副主任委员刘积学说：“贫沾富光，富沾天光”的谬论。他说，依照刘积学的说法，好似在旧社会过荒年还不要紧，有富人“救济”，但1941年河南省遭旱灾饿死多少人，他就忘了吗？如果说贫沾富光，沾卖地、卖房子、卖子女的光。听了这种谬论，我非常愤恨。
    郑州市公教医院院长王而信对储安平的“党天下”谬论反驳说：“郑州市有三个市级医院，就有三个非党人士当正院长，我就是其中的一个，并且有职有权，这能说是‘党天下’吗？”市商业工会曹福安以生动的事实驳斥了那些认为资产阶级没有两面性了，要求撤出公方代表的谬论。他说：“有些资本家认为公私合营了，赔、赚国家负责，自己还能拿到定息，因而消极怠工，装病请假看戏。自由市场开放后，有的就想退出合营单干，以便发财致富，这能说资产阶级没有两面性了吗？不需要改造了吗？”
    “二七”时代老工人、现在郑州铁路管理局机务段工人郑国钧说：蒋介石口头喊建设，他统治了二十多年，中国建设在哪里？解放后，在共产党领导下，才几年，我们建设了成渝铁路、长江大铁桥、汽车制造厂。这些不是共产党领导的吗？不是工人阶级双手制造的吗？肯定的说，没有共产党领导就不行。
    “二七”时代老工人、今天郑州“二七”纪念堂管理处副主任姜海世列举了储安平、葛佩琦、刘积学等人的反社会主义言论后，愤恨的说，听听这些人说的什么话，他们的目的很明显，就是企图乘整风运动机会，把共产党和工人阶级打翻，使新中国再回到半殖民地的地位。我们一定团结在共产党周围，粉碎一切反社会主义右派分子进攻。
