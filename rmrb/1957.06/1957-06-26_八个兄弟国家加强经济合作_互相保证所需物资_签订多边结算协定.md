    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 25th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the regular meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the Soviet Union and seven European People's Democratic countries, which began in Warsaw on June 18, concluded on June 22.

    The meeting considered that the comprehensive economic cooperation among the member states is developing in accordance with the principles of complete equality of rights and socialist mutual assistance, and that this comprehensive economic cooperation is in line with the common interests of the countries of the socialist camp.

    Since many member states have already made certain changes in their economic plans, the participating countries exchanged views on the suggestions adopted by the Berlin meeting of the committee in May 1956 regarding the production levels of each country and the mutual supply of important materials, and requested the member states to jointly take measures to best guarantee the needs of the national economies of the member states for coal, petroleum, petroleum products, metallurgical coke, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and other important products. The meeting expressed satisfaction with the cooperation agreement recently concluded between Poland and Democratic Germany on the construction of brown coal mines in Poland, and expressed approval of the statements by relevant countries that they were prepared to conduct bilateral negotiations on the issue of assisting Poland in developing the coal mining industry.

    The meeting recommended that the member states take steps to further strengthen the water and land transportation of import and export goods.

    The representatives of the participating countries unanimously agreed that the work carried out by the committee in 1955 and 1956 in the coordination of national economic plans is of great importance to the overall development of socialist construction in the member states. The meeting considered it necessary to continue working in this area, and believed that it is meaningful for the member states to cooperate in the long-term development plans of the basic sectors of the national economy for ten to fifteen years.

    During the meeting, the member states signed a multilateral clearing agreement, which will be conducive to further expanding trade among socialist countries.

    The representatives of the member states unanimously expressed their intention to work to create conditions for comprehensive economic cooperation among all European countries, regardless of social system. At the same time, they believed that the establishment of a so-called "common market" and the atomic energy joint venture within the scope of the Coal and Steel Community member states will become an obstacle to the development of foreign trade and other forms of economic cooperation between European countries, while developing such cooperation is in the interests of all European countries.

    Representatives from China, North Korea, and Yugoslavia participated in the meeting as observers.

　　八个兄弟国家加强经济合作
    互相保证所需物资  签订多边结算协定
    新华社华沙25日电  据波兰通讯社报道，6月18日开始在华沙举行的苏联和欧洲七个人民民主国家经济互助委员会的例会，已经在6月22日闭幕。
    会议认为，各会员国的全面经济合作正在根据权利完全平等和社会主义互助的原则发展，这种全面经济合作符合社会主义阵营各国的共同利益。
    由于许多会员国已经在自己的经济计划中作了某些变更，与会各国就1956年5月委员会柏林会议所通过的关于各国生产水平和互相供应重要物资的建议交换了意见，并且要求各会员国共同采取措施，来最好地保证各会员国国民经济所需要的煤、石油、石油产品、冶金焦炭、黑色和有色金属以及其他重要产品。会议对波兰和民主德国不久以前缔结的关于在波兰建设褐煤矿的合作协定表示满意，同时对有关国家声明准备就帮助波兰发展采煤工业问题进行双边谈判，表示赞同。
    会议建议各会员国采取步骤来进一步加强进出口货物的水陆运输。
    与会各国代表一致认为，委员会1955年、1956年在国民经济计划的协作方面所进行的工作，对于各会员国社会主义建设的全盘发展有着巨大的重要意义。会议认为必须继续在这方面进行工作，并且认为，各会员国在国民经济基本部门的十年到十五年长期发展计划方面进行协作，是有意义的。
    会议期间，各会员国签订了一项多边结算协定，这一协定将有利于进一步扩大社会主义各国间的贸易。
    各会员国的代表一致表示要努力为所有欧洲国家不问社会制度进行全面经济合作创造条件。同时，他们认为，在煤钢联营会员国范围内建立所谓“共同市场”以及原子能联营组织的作法，将成为发展欧洲各国对外贸易和其他形式的经济合作的障碍，而发展这种合作是符合所有欧洲国家的利益的。
    中国、朝鲜和南斯拉夫的代表都以观察员的身份参加了这次会议。
