　　Goty's Tears
　　Yuan Xianlu
    French President Goty has shown great concern for the massacre in Melouza, Algeria. It is reported that more than 300 peaceful residents of this village were killed on May 30 by a group of people of unknown origin.

    The day after the incident, President Goty immediately went to the radio to deliver a statement. He read the following passage from the statement in an excited tone: "No Frenchman, and no humane person in the world, can fail to feel grief and chilling to the bone upon hearing the news of this large-scale atrocity…" Hearing this, people seemed to see the French head of state already with tears in his eyes.

    But why is President Goty particularly concerned about the Melouza massacre and so moved to compassion?

    In the thirty months since the start of the Algerian War, the French colonial army has already left hundreds of thousands of innocent Muslims lying in pools of blood, and President Goty has never mentioned humanity once. This spring, some French writers and journalists exposed the atrocities of the French authorities in Algeria, causing outrage among the French public. Many prominent social figures jointly wrote to President Goty, asking him to stop this heinous act by the French government. At that time, President Goty neither grieved nor felt chilled, but remained unmoved.

    Why is the same President Goty so different before and after?

    As it turns out, after the Melouza incident, the French government immediately insisted that this was an atrocity committed by Algerian "rebels." Immediately afterwards, all the reactionary newspapers in France clamored that it was impossible to negotiate with the murderers, and therefore military action in Algeria must be strengthened. Thus, on June 6, the French Minister Resident in Algeria, Lacoste, convened a meeting and decided to take "comprehensive overall action" to deal with those participating in the Algerian national liberation movement. At the same time, the French government also dispatched a large number of police in various parts of the country to arrest hundreds of North African residents on charges of "participating in the Algerian rebellion." The eagerness of the French colonialists to make a big fuss about this incident naturally leads one to think that it was a planned action, the purpose of which was to divert public attention, to make everyone forget the crimes committed by the French authorities in Algeria, and to incite hatred towards the anti-French struggle organizations fighting for Algerian national rights, so as to further promote its unpopular policy of colonial suppression.

    Unfortunately, there is no fact that can be used to support this slanderous statement by the French government. Therefore, they had to resort to posturing. The French head of state was thus invited out to shed a few crocodile tears for the unfortunate victims.

    However, the rebuttal from the Algerian National Liberation Front is more convincing. This organization pointed out that it was the French colonial army that consistently massacred peaceful residents in Algeria, and rightly demanded that the United Nations investigate the Melouza incident. It would undoubtedly be the fairest approach to have an international organization determine the responsibility for this massacre through investigation. But the French government is so guilty that it has consistently dared not express its acceptance of this proposal for more than a week. The reason for this is self-evident.

    President Goty's tears were shed in vain, because a few fake tears cannot cover the eyes of the world after all. The bloodstains on the colonialists' knives cannot be erased by hypocritical tears.

　　戈蒂的眼泪
　　袁先禄
    法国总统戈蒂对阿尔及利亚迈卢兹的大屠杀显得十分关怀。据报道，这个村子里的三百多名和平居民，在5月30日被一批来历不明的人杀害了。
    事情发生后的第二天，戈蒂总统马上到电台上去发表了一篇文告。他用激动的声调念着文告中的下面一段话：“没有一个法国人，世界上也没有一个有人性的人，在获悉这种大规模暴行的消息时不是为之痛惜和寒心不止的……。”听到这里，人们仿佛看到法国的这位元首已经是泪水满眶了。
    但是，为什么戈蒂总统对迈卢兹的屠杀特别表现关切，而且这样动了恻隐之心呢？
    在阿尔及利亚战争开始以来的三十个月中，法国殖民军队已经使得好几十万善良的穆斯林躺倒在血泊里，戈蒂总统从来没有为此而提起过一次人性。今年春季，法国一些作家和新闻记者揭发了法国当局在阿尔及利亚的暴行，引起法国公众的愤慨。很多著名的社会人士纷纷联名写信给戈蒂总统，要求他制止法国政府的这种罪恶行径。当时，戈蒂总统既不痛惜，也不寒心，而是始终无动于衷。
    同一个戈蒂总统，而这样前后判若两人，这又是为什么呢？
    原来，在迈卢兹事件发生以后，法国政府就一口咬定，这是阿尔及利亚“叛乱分子”干出来的暴行。紧接着，法国所有反动报纸就齐声叫嚣，说是同杀人的凶手进行谈判是不行的，因此在阿尔及利亚的军事行动必须加强。于是，6月6日，法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长拉戈斯特召集了一个会议，决定采取“全盘的总体行动”来对付参加阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的人士。同时，法国政府在国内各地也出动大批警察，以“参与阿尔及利亚叛乱”的罪名逮捕了成百个北非籍居民。法国殖民主义者急不可待地就这个事件大作文章的情形，使人自然地想到它是一种有计划的行动，目的是想转移公众的目标，使大家忘掉法国当局在阿尔及利亚犯的罪行，并且挑起对于争取阿尔及利亚民族权利的反法斗争组织的仇视，便于它进一步推行不得人心的殖民镇压政策。
    可惜的是，没有任何事实可以用来支持法国政府的这种污蔑性的说法。于是，他们只好求助于装腔作势了。法国的元首就这样被请出来为不幸的受难者洒几滴鳄鱼的眼泪。
    但是，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的反驳是更有说服力的。这个组织指出在阿尔及利亚一贯屠杀和平居民的正是法国殖民军队，并且理直气壮地要求联合国对迈卢兹事件进行调查。由一个国际性组织通过调查来断定这场大屠杀罪责何在，这无疑是一个最公正的做法。但是法国政府却如此心虚，一个多星期来始终不敢表示接受这个建议。这中间是什么缘故，实在是昭然若揭了。
    戈蒂总统的眼泪是白流了，因为几滴假眼泪毕竟掩不住天下人的眼睛。殖民主义者屠刀上的斑斑血迹不是伪善的泪水所能抹得掉的。
