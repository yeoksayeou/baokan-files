　　A Good Township Head
　　Jin Jin
　　The township head is really a good person.

　　If you ask me exactly how good he is, I can't say it all. However, when you meet him, you feel very kind, as if you are willing to talk to him about anything. He won't say polite words, won't shake hands and pat shoulders everywhere. When he comes back from the district with reports to convey to the villagers, he speaks ordinary words, in his own way, so simple, so easy to understand, conveying all the important meanings. He doesn't even take notes, relying entirely on his memory. But everyone is willing to listen, everyone trusts him, and after the meeting, everyone goes out and does what he says.

　　Back in the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was already doing underground work in the village. He is a strong and brave Communist Party member. At that time, the guerrilla隊in the Western Hills often came out to fight the Japanese devils and were very active. He would go through the enemy's tight blockade, carrying grain to the mountains to help his own troops. Even now, when the villagers talk about the heroic stories of the guerrilla隊, they will talk about how the township head delivered grain back then, and it has become a favorite story for the children.

　　In the summer of 1954, it kept raining, for more than a hundred days. The township suffered from flooding, cotton grew less than a foot high, and the corn cobs grew thin, without a single full kernel. Autumn harvest was easier. The township head was busy every day understanding the living conditions of relief households and had to go to the district to attend meetings and collect relief funds, running back and forth. When winter came, the district sent down another batch of cotton clothes, and the township head gave them all to the villagers who had the most difficult lives. In the end, there was only one pair of cotton cloth sneakers left. The clerk of the township government said, "Township head, you should wear these sneakers." Everyone saw that the township head was wearing a pair of old cloth shoes, the heels were worn almost through, and his feet were frozen red and swollen. No one wanted to take the cotton cloth sneakers, everyone said they should be given to the township head. An old villager insisted that the township head try them on, and they fit perfectly. But the township head refused to take them, and in the end, they were given to a single old man.

　　The following spring, the district sent people to the township to investigate, saying that someone had written a letter to the district accusing the township head of embezzling a certain amount of relief funds. But the villagers didn't believe it and scolded the person who reported him. Everyone guessed that it was done by some bad egg. The district cadres went to the township head's home and saw that he was eating worse than the villagers. The district cadres understood that the accusation was all rumors, and the accuser was the son of a landlord. His family's life was not bad, but he clamored for the township head to subsidize his tuition for middle school, and the township head refused, so the landlord's son pulled this trick.

　　The township head was so angry that he was sick for a day. The next morning, I ran into him and talked about this matter. He said, "I don't keep it in my heart. It's inevitable to be fair."

　　He was busy doing things diligently again.

　　The township head is the kind of Communist Party member that the villagers hope for, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of being wronged. He thinks about how to do the work of the township government better every day.

　　一个好乡长

    乡长真是个好人。
    你要问我究竟他有多么好，我也说不全。不过，你碰见他的时候，就觉得很亲切，好像有什么话都愿意跟他讲。他不会说客气话，不会到处握手、拍肩膀。他从区里听了报告来给乡亲们传达，说的就是一些普普通通的话，是用他自己的话说出来的，那么简单，那么容易懂，把重要的意思都说出来了，他还不会记笔记，完全是凭脑子记下来的，可是谁都愿意听，谁都信任他，大家散了会出来，就照着他的话去做了。
    还是在抗日战争的时候，他就在村子里做地下工作了，他是一个坚强勇敢的共产党员。那时候西山的游击队常常出来打日本鬼子，很活跃。他就通过敌人严密的封锁线，背着粮食到山里去接济自己的队伍。直到现在，老乡们一谈起游击队的英雄故事，就会谈到乡长当年是怎样去送粮食的，而且已经成为孩子们最爱听的故事了。
    1954年的夏天老是下大雨，连着下了一百多天，乡里闹涝灾，棉花长得不到一尺高，包米棒子长得细细的，没有一粒饱满的子，秋收倒省事了。乡长天天忙着了解救济户的生活情况，还要上区里去开会，领救济款，一趟一趟的来回跑。冬天来了，区里又发下来一批棉衣，乡长都发给了生活最困难的老乡们。发到最后，还剩一双棉布胶鞋，乡政府的办事员说：“乡长，这双胶鞋给你穿了吧。”大家看到乡长脚上穿着的一双老布鞋，后跟磨得快要有窟窿了，脚背冻得又红又肿，谁也不愿领这双棉布胶鞋了，都说要给乡长，有个老乡硬要乡长试一试脚，正合适。可是乡长怎么也不肯要，最后还是给一个独身汉的老大爷穿的。
    第二年的春天，区里派人到乡里来调查，说是有人写信到区里告了乡长，说乡长贪污救济款多少多少。可是老乡们都不相信，还骂了去告发的人，大家猜想是哪个坏蛋干的。区干部到乡长的家里去坐了一回，看到他家里吃的比老乡们还苦，区干部明白了，告发信里尽是造谣，而且告的人是个地主的儿子，他家里的生活过得并不坏，却吵着要乡长补助上中学的学费，乡长不答应，地主的儿子就来了这一套。
    乡长气得病了一天，第二天早上我碰到他，谈起这件事，他说：“我不记在心里，要做得公道，这是难免的。”
    他又勤勤恳恳的忙着办事了。
    乡长就是老乡们所希望的那样的共产党员，不怕吃苦，不怕受冤枉，他天天想到的，就是怎样把乡政府的工作办得更好。
