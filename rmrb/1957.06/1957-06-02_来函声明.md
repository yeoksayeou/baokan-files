    Letter of Clarification to the People's Daily:
    The title of my speech (see page 2 of the People's Daily on the 31st), written as "Active Elements," is clearly inappropriate. Active elements should definitely be affirmed as good. What I said in my speech was "so-called active elements," i.e., "fake active elements," which is distinctly different from "active elements," and the two should not be confused. Please correct this to avoid misunderstanding.
            Zhang Yunchuan May 31st

    来函声明人民日报：
    我发言的标题，（见31日人民日报第二版）正面写为“积极分子”，显然不妥。积极分子应该肯定是好的。我发言时说的是“所谓积极分子”，即“假积极分子”，与“积极分子”显有分别，两者不可混淆，请更正，免滋误解。
