Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 17th: The Colombo Conference of the World Peace Council concluded in Colombo this morning after seven days of work. The conference unanimously adopted an appeal for the cessation of atomic weapons tests, a declaration calling for the cessation of atomic weapons tests and disarmament, and resolutions on easing tensions and other related issues. (The appeal, declaration, and resolutions can be found on page five.)
    At the end of the meeting, cheers and applause erupted in the hall of the Oriental Hotel, celebrating the victory of peace and expressing confidence in the future.
    The conference also passed an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, which stated: Humanity is in danger. Atomic weapons tests are poisoning the air, land, and water. We ask you to use your good offices to ensure that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union immediately conclude an agreement to cease all atomic weapons tests.
    The conference unanimously elected Mrs. Isabelle Blume, a famous Belgian history professor, and Dr. James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, as the new Vice-Presidents of the World Peace Council. The conference also elected new secretaries of the World Peace Council from six countries, including China, Colombia, France, India, Sudan, and the Soviet Union. The conference also elected seven new members to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, five of whom are representatives from Asian and African countries.
    The closing meeting did not begin until almost midnight, in order to give the committees more time and opportunity to hear different opinions from all parties and reach agreements. When Guo Moruo finished the closing speech, it was already three o'clock in the morning, and the venue was filled with a festive atmosphere. Guo Moruo wished all the delegates a safe journey home, and everyone stood up and cheered for a long time, singing songs in support of peace in various languages with the same melody.
    The delegates left the Oriental Hotel in the drizzling rain, where they were welcomed by the citizens of Colombo, some of whom had been waiting for good news, and some of whom had been awakened from their dreams by the long line of cars.
    About five hundred delegates and observers from sixty-nine countries participated in the conference, including famous peace fighters and newcomers. This situation shows that the peace movement has further expanded. Fifty-two journalists from twenty countries reported on the conference, many of whom also served as delegates.
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 17th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council, said in his closing speech at the end of the conference on the 17th that this conference had issued a call of the times.
    In his closing speech, Guo Moruo first praised the government and people of Ceylon on behalf of all the delegates and expressed his gratitude to them. He said that their support was the most valuable gift given to the Colombo Conference.
    He said that our meeting was a free forum for the peace movement. We had in-depth discussions on the main issues concerning peace at present. Our meeting issued a call of the times. This resounding call that will echo around the world will have repercussions in the future and will certainly produce extremely beneficial effects.
    “We should all faithfully speak for the people of our respective countries, but we should also be prepared to listen to others’ opinions with an open mind.
    “After these debates and discussions, various different opinions gradually converged, and even those opinions that could not converge quickly were indeed closer than before, and will eventually be able to converge.
    “Converging opinions have been reaffirmed in the resolutions. We firmly advocate peaceful coexistence, oppose hatred and confrontation; advocate the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and advocate universal disarmament; advocate respect for national independence, oppose colonialism and the threat of force; advocate the elimination of restrictions and obstacles to economic and cultural exchanges between peoples of all countries, and advocate the elimination of all embargoes on trade."
    He said that all of this is what the people of the world have expressed. Needless to say, the realization of these three resolutions and the actual implementation of these resolutions will require our continued efforts. To solve certain problems, it will also require special efforts by a particular country or some countries concerned.
    Guo Moruo said: "Our Colombo Conference clearly shows that the future of the peace movement is very bright. The peace movement, which was mainly founded and promoted by our European friends eight or nine years ago, has received increasingly broad support from the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Its foundation is becoming more and more solid, because this foundation is becoming more and more extensive. This is something that we should all be happy about.
    He expressed his hope to see more friends from more countries, especially American friends, participate in future Council meetings. He said that the American people are peace-loving people, and the Council may one day hold a meeting in New York or San Francisco. We all hope to do this soon, and the sooner the better.
    Guo Moruo said: "We are indeed living in an era where a new civilization is gradually taking shape. Atomic energy will be used more universally for peaceful purposes. People will no longer need war. They will concentrate their efforts on making nature serve mankind. People will live in peace, just like living in fresh air."
    He concluded by saying, please allow me to say it again, our meeting has been very successful. This conference has further strengthened the peace movement, and it has great historical significance in promoting the happiness of mankind.

　　世界和平理事会科伦坡会议告诉全人类
　　当前和平运动的迫切任务
　　停止核武器试验、裁军、缓和紧张局势
    新华社科伦坡17日电　世界和平理事会科伦坡会议经过了七天的工作，今天凌晨在科伦坡闭幕。会议一致通过了要求停止原子核试验的呼吁书、要求停止原子核武器试验和裁军的宣言以及关于缓和紧张局势和其他有关问题的决议。（呼吁书、宣言、决议见第五版）
    会议结束的时候，东方大饭店的大厅里响起了一阵阵的欢呼声和掌声，庆祝和平的胜利，表示对于将来的信心。
    会议还通过了致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的公开信，这封信说：人类正处在危险之中，原子核武器试验正在毒化空气、土地和水流。我们要求你通过你的斡旋使联合王国、美国、苏联三国一起立即缔结协议，停止一切原子核武器试验。
    会议一致通过比利时著名历史学教授伊莎贝丽·布伦姆夫人和加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士为世界和平理事会新任的副主席。会议还选出世界和平理事会新任的书记，包括中国、哥伦比亚、法国、印度、苏丹、苏联等六国各一名。会议还选出了世界和平理事会常务委员会的七名新委员，其中有五名是亚非国家的代表。
    闭幕会议差不多到午夜的时候才开始，以便各委员会有更多的时间和机会听取各方面发表的不同意见和达成协议。当郭沫若致闭幕词结束的时候，时间已经是早上三点钟，这时会场里充满了节日的气氛。郭沫若预祝全体代表一路平安，大家起立欢呼，经久不息，并且用各种语言按着同一的调子歌唱拥护和平的歌曲。
    代表们在蒙蒙细雨中离开东方大饭店，他们受到了科伦坡市民的欢迎，其中有些人一直在等待着好消息，有些人是被长列的汽车从梦中唤醒而来的。
    参加这次会议的有来自六十九国的代表和观察员约五百人，其中有著名的和平战士，也有新人。这种情况表明，和平运动已经进一步扩大。报道会议消息的有来自二十个国家的五十二名新闻记者，其中有许多人同时也兼作代表。
    新华社科伦坡17日电　出席世界和平理事会的中国代表团团长郭沫若17日在会议结束时致闭幕词说，这次会议发出了时代的呼声。
    郭沫若在闭幕词中首先代表全体代表赞扬锡兰政府和人民，并且对他们表示感谢。他说，他们的支持是给予科伦坡会议的最宝贵的礼物。
    他说，我们的会议是和平运动的自由讲坛。我们对当前关于和平方面的主要问题进行了深入的讨论。我们的会议发出了时代的呼声。这个响彻全球的呼声将在今后得到反响，并且一定会产生极其有益的效果。
    “我们大家都应该忠实地为我们各自国家的人民讲话，但是我们也应该准备虚心地听取别人的意见。
    “在进行了这些辩论和讨论以后，各种不同的意见逐渐趋于一致，甚至那些不能很快趋于一致的意见也的确比以前较为接近了，最后也将有可能趋于一致。
    “趋于一致的意见已经在决议中重新加以肯定。我们坚决主张和平共处，反对仇恨和对抗；主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，主张普遍裁军；主张尊重民族独立，反对殖民主义和武力威胁；主张消除对各国人民之间的经济和文化交流的限制和障碍，主张消除对贸易的一切禁运。”
    他说，这一切都是全世界人民所表示的。不用说，实现这三项决议和实际执行这些决议是需要我们大家不断努力的。要使某些问题得到解决，也需要有关的某一个国家或某一些国家作特别的努力。
    郭沫若说：“我们的科伦坡会议清楚地表明，和平运动的前途是非常光明的。在八、九年前主要是由我们的欧洲朋友奠定和推动的和平运动已经得到亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民愈来愈广泛的支持。它的基础愈来愈巩固了，因为这个基础愈来愈广泛了。这是我们大家应当高兴的事情。
    他表示希望看到来自更多国家的更多朋友、特别是美国朋友参加以后召开的理事会会议。他说，美国人民是爱好和平的人民，可能有一天理事会会在纽约或者旧金山举行会议。我们大家都希望能很快做到这一点，而且愈快愈好。
    郭沫若说：“我们的确生活在新文明正在逐渐形成的时代。原子能将更普遍地用于和平方面。人们将不再需要战争。他们将集中自己的力量来使自然为人类服务。人们将生活在和平中，就像生活在新鲜空气中一样。”
    他最后说，请允许我再说一遍，我们这次会议开得非常成功。这次会议进一步加强了和平运动，它在促进人类的幸福方面有很大的历史意义。
