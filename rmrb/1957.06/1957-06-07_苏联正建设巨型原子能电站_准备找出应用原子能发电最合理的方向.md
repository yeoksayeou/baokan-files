Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th. The Soviet Union is building new nuclear power plants.

According to the "Moscow Evening News", the power plants under construction have several types of reactors. One type uses ordinary water as a moderator, and each reactor can drive three 70,000 kilowatt generators. Another type uses graphite as a moderator and will be equipped with generators each capable of generating 100,000 kilowatts.

While building new nuclear power plants, arduous research work is also being carried out. Scientists are studying the applicability, strength, and durability of various materials, structures, and components of the power plants. At the same time, they are also studying issues such as ensuring the absolute safety of staff and reducing the cost of electricity generated by nuclear power plants to be lower than the cost of electricity generated by ordinary fuels. These research efforts are actually to clarify the various indicators of using atomic energy for power generation, so as to find the most rational direction for applying atomic energy to power generation.

    苏联正建设巨型原子能电站
    准备找出应用原子能发电最合理的方向
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联正在建设新的原子能发电站。
    据“莫斯科晚报”报道，正在建设中的发电站有几种类型的反应堆。一种是以普通水做减速剂，每座反应堆可以带动三部每部七万瓩的发电机。另一种是以石墨做减速剂，将安装每部发电能力有十万瓩的发电机。
    在建设新的原子能发电站的时候同时要进行繁重的研究工作。科学家们正在对发电站的各种材料、结构、部件的适用性和坚固耐久能力进行研究。同时，还在研究保障工作人员的绝对安全和使原子能发电站的电力比用普通燃料发出的电力的成本低廉等问题。这些研究工作实际上是要弄清把原子能用于发电的各种指标的问题，以便找出应用原子能发电的最合理的方向。
