The People Need Actors Like This
　　Tian Han
　　In 1952, during the Central and Southern China Opera Performance, Li Xiaocang and I went to Hankou and saw several excellent Henan operas, including "Luoyang Bridge," also known as "Ye Hanyan." I heard that this opera was originally made famous by Chen Suzhen, and she also contributed to its creation, but I left Wuhan before I had the chance to see her perform it myself.
　　This wish was finally fulfilled last winter. I went to Zhengzhou for an inspection task with the People's Congress and met Chen Suzhen, a plain, nearly middle-aged female artist with a man's haircut, wearing a blue cloth uniform. She happened to be returning to Henan from Lanzhou for a meeting. The previous year, a submitted article in the Drama Journal, "The People Don't Want Famous Actors Like This," had unjustly criticized her, causing her great distress. She appealed to me, and to increase my understanding of her performance art, and also due to the enthusiastic requests of her hometown audience, she allowed me to enjoy her "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "Universe Official Hat," and her masterpiece "Ye Hanyan" (i.e., "Luoyang Bridge") at the Zhengzhou People's Theater. Later, at the Xiangguo Temple Theater in Kaifeng, she also performed "Three Flourishing Sleeves" for us. In her thirty-odd years, she has performed countless plays and created many roles. It's a pity I didn't see her artistic youth, but the few works I saw already fully demonstrated that she is a talented and skilled performing artist. In private, she is so ordinary and simple, but once on stage, she is truly like a dragon or tiger, full of vigor and brilliance! I also heard that in her youth, she collaborated with the opera playwright and activist Mr. Fan Cuiting, receiving his support and guidance, and performing many plays written by Mr. Fan for her. There is no doubt that this external support had a great influence on her, but Chen Suzhen's achievement is ultimately due to her deep love for the dramatic arts, and her willingness to contribute her entire energy and rare wisdom to it. In the past, the performing arts and makeup and costumes of Henan opera were not very sophisticated. Under the inspiration of her teachers and friends, Chen Suzhen constantly learned from the excellent examples of her predecessors, and also absorbed the strengths of other opera genres to enrich and improve herself, finally making herself famous and gradually changing the face of Henan opera.
　　Chen Suzhen's spirit of diligence and hard work is very prominent. In the past, when she performed in the Kaifeng and Shangqiu areas, the living and working conditions were very difficult. She would shout her voice out in the bitter cold and scorching heat, day after day for ten years. She would practice bending her waist and wielding swords alone under the moonlight after each performance. During one of her performances in Zhengzhou, the police checked household registrations and said that the strokes of her name were incorrect, so they arrested her and locked her in the public security bureau for a night. She refused to sleep in the prison cell, preferring to run around the courtyard outside the iron bars, practicing broken steps, oblivious to everyone else!
　　A few months ago, Chen Suzhen went to Beijing to treat her voice, staying at my house for about a month. We discovered that she would quietly get up early every morning and practice her braid-twirling and fan-wielding skills in our garden, without interruption. Therefore, when she left my house, I sent her this poem:
　　Many opera immortals rise in Central Plains,
　　You are the first in diligent training.
　　How many times you bent your waist under the bright moon,
　　What does it matter if broken steps are taken before iron bars?
　　Sleeves dance with the bitterness of the beautiful woman,
　　Braids fly with the passion of Ye Hanyan.
　　The people need you to add light and heat,
　　Cherish your pearly throat and appreciate your prime.
　　Indeed, the people need actors like this. In Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, I saw with my own eyes how much the audiences in her hometown loved her art. Her disciples, like Wu Bibo and Guan Lingfeng, were also tearfully hoping that she could stay in Henan to educate the younger generation, but she joined the Hebei Henan Opera Troupe, which has a history of struggle. This is also good, as the Beijing audience will have an earlier, and not-to-be-delayed, opportunity to appreciate her near-mature acting skills.
　　After her "Ye Hanyan" and "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" were performed in the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles building, our old playwright Comrade Ouyang Yuqian said excitedly to me:
　　"She is acting! She has talent and skill." We know that Yuqian does not easily approve of people, and this controlled praise is enough to comfort Comrade Chen Suzhen.
　　What seemed to make Yuqian most happy was "Ye Hanyan" (he was not feeling well and could not sit for long, but he was attracted to watch this play to the end). From this play, he saw Chen Suzhen's cultivation and mastery as a Bangzi Hua Dan. Bangzi Hua Dan emphasizes the skill of the eyes, hands, fan, braids, and flowered soles, and she has them all. Her performance is so clean, crisp, and accurate. Especially in the dressing scene, Ye Hanyan is alone in her boudoir, applying powder and rouge, drawing her eyebrows and eyes, joyfully waiting for the eagle-shooting hero Hua Rong—the disguised lover. When she hears the drums and music outside, and the bridal sedan chair is about to arrive, she is so excited that her eyebrows dance and her heart beats wildly, and she becomes flustered. One moment she applies the powder in the wrong place, the next moment the pearl flower pricks her skin; one moment she picks the wrong shirt, the next moment she wears the skirt inside out; when the rouge and powder are applied evenly, the flowers are properly worn, and the clothes are correctly dressed, she looks in the mirror and feels that she is dressed to her satisfaction. Then, she grabs her braid with one hand and opens her fan with the other, responding to the urgent pipes and strings, flying down like a peacock. This is using a very exaggerated method to express the passion of a young woman in first love, but it is so natural and reasonable, which is very rare. We all want to express the truth of the heart, but physical movements are often restricted, and rarely can they be as open as Ye Hanyan's dressing. Erhuang opera has also accepted the expression methods of Bangzi Hua Dan, but not completely, not as "wild" as Bangzi, that is, not as "open" as Bangzi.
　　Expressing unrestrained inner feelings with highly exaggerated, open artistic forms is precisely the world we want to pursue. This world is embodied in the dressing scene to a certain degree of completeness. Bangzi Hua Dan pays great attention to using the eyes, almost the whole body moves with the eyes. But it must be purposeful, and not allowed to move randomly. Comrade Yuqian believes that this is worth learning for drama actors, because drama actors do not know how to use their eyes, so that often when playing a pair of lovers, they do not look like they are in love.
　　Comrade Yuqian had an opinion on Chen Suzhen's sleeve dance in the scene where Ye Hanyan meets the matchmaker. He believes that when Ye Hanyan discovers that the matchmaker is the mother of the eagle-shooting hero, she should be very surprised, admire her for having such a good son, and express a warm love for her future mother-in-law, almost wanting to rush up and hug her, and then enthusiastically recall and describe her son's heroic posture of drawing his bow and shooting arrows, and two eagles falling to the ground. In this way, her dance posture will have a sufficient psychological process. Because the psychological process, that is, the life basis, is not enough, those wonderful dances are somewhat reduced to a pile of techniques, so Comrade Zhou Enlai, who was watching the play at the time, said to Yuqian:
　　"Is there a little too much water sleeve here?"
　　This also tells us that all good performing techniques must be combined with the character's emotions in order to be just right and reach artistic heights.
　　Yuqian also mentioned that the dressing scene is like a torrent of passion, but if it flows down with the same tight rhythm, it will easily become monotonous. There should be a certain pause in the unrestrainedness, that is, there are still slower movements in the urgent pipes and strings, such as when she picks out her clothes, this is not right, that is not right, the more anxious she is, the more chaotic her hands are, and finally she picks the right one, and then she quickly puts it on, she feels unparalleled joy, unparalleled pride.
　　Yuqian also mentioned that some of Chen Suzhen's dance movements still inevitably have more trivial life imitations. He believes that some life details can be omitted to pursue the concentration of emotions, which is also the concentration of images and the concentration of thoughts.
　　But Yuqian is very happy with Chen Suzhen's performance. He said that she knows how to act; neither lukewarm nor vulgar, and can correct current malpractices.
　　After Chen Suzhen performed "Three Flourishing Sleeves," many comrades who still held reservations about her art were also convinced. This is not only because she showed the talents of "Qingyi," "Hua Dan," "Dao Ma Dan," and "Xiao Sheng" in this play, but mainly because she can very vividly and deeply portray the noble and strong character of the heroine in the play. Some scenes are also difficult to perform, but she overcame the difficulties.
　　Seriously speaking, the script of "Three Flourishing Sleeves" is not without flaws, but Chen Suzhen's realistic performing art has made up for the shortcomings and made it shine. The playwright Mr. Fan Cuiting once said that many of his scripts were written after Chen Suzhen performed them, and it should be said that it is a joint creation of the playwright and the actor. The high degree of cooperation between playwrights and actors is actually one of the important methods to promote creation.
　　The plays that Chen Suzhen brought this time also include the traditional program "Golden Cicada," which she herself has reorganized. In addition, the Hebei Henan Opera Troupe also has "Tianbo Building," "Rolling Mat," "Chen Sanliang Climbing the Hall" starring Song Shuyun, "Han Xin Bidding Farewell to His General" starring Zhou Lanfeng, "Wang Jindou Borrowing Grain" starring Li Yunfang and Zhao Guiying, "Judging the Imperial Decree" starring Zhao Xinting, and "Sima Miao Accusing" starring Chang Jinzhong.
　　This Henan Opera Troupe evolved from the Ji-Lu-Yu Mass Drama Society, which was born in 1942. In the past fifteen years, they have gone through many fierce battles, 80% of the members are Communist Youth League members, and 30% of the adult members have joined the Party. Comrade Chen Suzhen resolutely joined such a troupe, which shows her yearning for the truth, and this will guarantee the continued development of her art and better meet the needs of the people.

　　人民需要这样的演员
　　田汉
    1952年中南戏曲会演的时候和李啸仓兄到汉口，曾看过几个优秀的豫剧，其中有“洛阳桥”，即“叶含嫣”，听说这个戏最初是陈素真演出名的，也有她的创造，但没有来得及看她自己的演出就离开武汉了。
    这心愿直到去年冬天才得满足。我因人大视察任务到郑州，遇了陈素真，一位剪男人头发、穿蓝布制服、将近中年的、朴素的女艺人。她恰巧由兰州回河南开会，由于前年戏剧报登过一篇来稿：“人民不要这样的名演员”，对她有不实的责难，给了她很大的打击，她对我做了申诉，为着增进我对她的表演艺术的了解，同时也由于她的故乡观众热烈的要求，她在郑州人民剧场让我欣赏了她的“拾玉镯”，“宇宙锋”，和她的杰作“叶含嫣”（即“洛阳桥”），其后又在开封相国寺剧场又为我们演出了“三拂袖”。三十几年来，她演过无数的剧目，创造过许多角色，可惜我不曾见她的艺术的青年时代，但就我所看到的这几个作品已经充分说明她是一个有才能、有技术的优秀的表演艺术家。她在私下里是如此的平凡、质朴，而一上舞台却真是生龙活虎似的纵横腾掷和有光彩！也曾听说过，在她的青年时代，她跟戏曲剧作家和活动家樊粹廷先生合作，得过他的支持辅导，演过樊先生为她写的许多剧本。这种外力支援给了她很大影响是不用怀疑的，但陈素真的成就也毕竟由于她对戏剧艺术发生了高度热爱，她愿意为着它贡献其全部精力和稀有的智慧。以前豫剧的表演艺术和化妆服装等也是不太讲究的，陈素真在师友们的启迪下，不断学习先辈优秀典型之外，并吸取别的剧种的长处来丰富自己，改进自己，终于使她自己成名，也逐渐改变了豫剧的面目。
    陈素真的勤学苦练精神是很突出的。以前她在开封、商丘一带演出中，生活工作条件都十分困难，她曾冒着严寒酷暑喊嗓子，十年如一日，她曾在每晚散戏之后独自一人在月亮底下弓腰，练把子。到郑州演出的某次，警察查户口，说她的名字笔划不对，把她抓到公安局关了一宿。她不肯进监房里睡，宁愿在铁栏外院子里跑圆场，练碎步，旁若无人！
    几个月前，陈素真曾到北京治嗓子，住在我家约一个月。我们发现她每天一清早就悄悄起来了，在我们苑子里练习耍辫子和耍扇子的功夫，从不间断。因此她离开我家的时候我曾送她这样一首诗：
    中州云起几歌仙，
    苦练勤修数汝先。
    几度弓腰明月下，
    何妨碎步铁窗前。
    袖舞辛酸艳容女，
    辫飞情焰叶含嫣。
    人民要汝添光热，
    珍重珠喉惜盛年。
    的确，人民是需要这样的演员的。我在郑州、开封亲眼看到她故乡的观众是多么热爱她的艺术。她的徒弟像吴碧波、关灵凤们也是那样流着眼泪希望她能留在河南教育青年一代，但她却参加了一个有战斗历史的河北省豫剧团。这样也好，北京观众就有了较早的，也不能再迟的机会来欣赏她的近于成熟的演技了。
    当她的“叶含嫣”和“拾玉镯”等在北京文联大楼演出之后，我们的老戏剧家欧阳予倩同志很兴奋地对我说：
    “她演的是戏！她有才能，也有工夫”。我们知道予倩是不轻易许可人家的，这一有控制的赞词已经够陈素真同志安慰了。
    最使予倩高兴的似乎还是“叶含嫣”（他身体不好，不能久坐，但这个戏他被吸引着看完了）。他从这个戏看出陈素真作为梆子花旦的修养火候。梆子花旦注重眼睛，手，扇子，辫子，花帮子等的工夫，而她都有，她表演得如此的干净，麻利，准确。特别是梳妆那场，叶含嫣独自一个人在闺房里，傅粉涂脂，描眉画眼，满心喜悦地等待着射雕英雄花荣——那男扮女装的情郎。及至听到外面鼓乐齐鸣，花轿将到，她兴奋得眉飞心跳，手忙脚乱。一会儿粉拍错了地方，一会儿珠花插疼了肉；一会儿拣错了衫子，一会儿穿翻了裙子；及至脂粉匀好了，花戴好了，衣裙穿好了，对对镜子觉得自己打扮得称心如意了，便一手捉住辫子，一手打开扇子，应着急管繁弦，像孔雀似的飞着下去，这是用非常夸张的方法来表现初恋少女的激情，但又如此自然而合理，这就十分难得。我们都要求表现内心的真实，但形体动作每每容易受拘束，很少能像叶含嫣梳妆那样的放得开。二簧戏本来也接受了梆子花旦的表现方法，但不完全，还不如梆子的“野”，也就是不如梆子的“放得开”。
    用高度夸张的、放得开的艺术形式表现奔放的内心感情正是我们要追求的世界。这个世界在梳妆这一场得到一定的完满体现。梆子花旦十分注重用眼睛，几乎整个身体随着眼睛在转动。但又要有目的性，不许乱动。予倩同志认为这一点很值得话剧演员学习，因为话剧演员就不会用眼睛，以致时常演一对爱人而看去却不相爱。
    予倩同志对陈素真在叶含嫣见花婆一场的袖舞却有意见。他认为当叶含嫣发现花婆便是射雕英雄的母亲的时候她应当十分惊喜，赞叹她有那样好的儿子，并表示对她的未来的婆婆的一种热烈敬爱，几乎要扑上去抱她，然后以热情的回忆描绘她儿子怎样张弓放箭，双雕落地的英武姿态。这样，她的舞姿才有足够的心理过程。由于心理过程也就是生活根据不很够，那些美妙的舞蹈便多少陷于技术的堆砌，所以当时在场观剧的周总理恩来同志对予倩说：
    “这里水袖是不是多了一点？”
    这也告诉了我们一切好的表演技术必须与人物感情相结合，才能恰到好处，才能达到艺术高度。
    予倩也提到梳妆那场好比一道激情的奔流，但若以同一紧密的节奏奔下去，便也容易单调。它应当在奔放中有一定停顿，即急管繁弦中仍有较慢的动作，如她拣衣裳，这也不是，那也不对，心越急，手越乱，最后终于拣到合适的了，这才赶忙穿起来了，她感到无比的欢喜，无比的骄傲。
    予倩也提到陈素真的某些舞蹈动作还不免有较琐碎的生活摩拟，他以为可以省略一些生活细节而追求感情的集中，这也就是形象的集中，思想的集中。
    但予倩十分欢喜陈素真的表演。他说她懂得做戏；既不瘟，也不庸俗，很能救正时弊。
    陈素真演过“三拂袖”之后，许多对她的艺术还持保留态度的同志们也心服了。这不止因为她在这剧中表现了“青衣”、“花旦”、“刀马旦”、“小生”等多方面的才能，主要在于她能非常生动深刻地刻划了剧中女主人公那样一个高尚坚强的性格。有些场戏也是很难表演的，但她克服了困难。
    认真说，“三拂袖”的剧本不是没有毛病的，陈素真的现实主义的表演艺术，却弥补了缺点，使它发出了光彩。剧作者樊粹廷先生曾说，他的许多剧本是先由陈素真演出后才写定的，应该说它是剧作者与演员的共同创作。剧作者与演员的高度合作其实也是繁荣创作的重要法门之一。
    陈素真这次带来的戏还有她自己整理的传统节目“黄金蝉”。此外，河北省豫剧团还有宋淑云们主演的“天波楼”，“卷席筒”，“陈三两爬堂”，周兰凤的“韩信拜帅”，李韵舫、赵桂英们的“王金豆借粮”，赵鑫亭的“审诰命”，常金钟的“司马邈告状”等。
    这个豫剧团是从1942年诞生的冀鲁豫大众剧社衍变而来的。十五年以来他们经过许多激烈战斗，成员中80％的青年是共青团员，30％的成年团员入了党。陈素真同志毅然加入这样的剧团，说明了她对真理的向往，这也将保证她的艺术继续发展，更好地满足人民的需要。
