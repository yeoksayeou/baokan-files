Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch, June 6th: The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 5th to review and discuss the situation, problems, and suggestions for improvement in Beijing's campaign to increase production and practice thrift.

The meeting considered that Beijing had achieved certain successes in the campaign. In a situation where raw materials and production tasks were very insufficient, the vast majority of industrial and mining enterprises overfulfilled their production plans. Forty central state-owned industrial and mining enterprises completed 107% of their gross output value plan in the first quarter. Local state-owned industries completed 107.3% of their gross output value plan from January to May. There have also been many achievements in saving raw materials.

The meeting pointed out that the current campaign to increase production and practice thrift is not very thorough in many respects. Some departments, in leading the campaign, have formalism and serious bureaucracy, being satisfied with holding a meeting and issuing a call, without deeply understanding the situation or solving specific problems. Some local state-owned enterprises and joint public-private enterprises have only made plans for increasing production and practicing thrift, but have not implemented them among the masses, and have not truly launched a broad campaign among the workers and staff. Recently, some departments have relaxed their leadership over production due to being busy with rectification. Therefore, the campaign to increase production and practice thrift in some factories has begun to stagnate. The meeting believed that the quality of certain industrial products is currently unsatisfactory. According to statistics from the First and Second Local Industry Bureaus on 110 products, the quality of 45 products has increased, 42 products have remained stable, and 23 products have decreased. A small number of factories have also experienced some serious quality accidents. The meeting particularly pointed out that there are many problems in capital construction, and there is a risk of failing to complete the tasks this year. This is mainly due to the fact that there are many difficulties and problems in the supply of materials and the material supply system, which has caused many construction sites to be shut down waiting for materials, or to be in a state of semi-paralysis due to insufficient materials. In addition, there are also problems with the management thinking and management systems of some units, resulting in many unnecessary and avoidable delays in construction. If this situation is not changed immediately, many important capital construction tasks will not be completed; or although much of the capital construction workload can be completed, there will not be many finished products that can be delivered for use, which will cause great waste. The meeting pointed out that since the beginning of this year, quality accidents in capital construction have continued to occur, some of which are quite serious. In the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, we must earnestly pay attention to ensuring and improving product quality.

The meeting believed that in the current situation of insufficient supply of many raw materials, it is completely necessary to pay special attention to saving raw materials in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, but at the same time, it must be emphasized that raw materials are saved on the condition of ensuring product quality. Some practices that have already occurred in saving raw materials, which only unilaterally save materials while ignoring product quality, are very wrong. Some so-called savings in raw materials are actually a disguised form of cutting corners. The result of doing so will not only fail to achieve the purpose of saving, but will instead cause greater losses to state property and people's lives. The meeting required that all industrial and mining enterprises must implement a comprehensive viewpoint in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, and that increased production, thrift, quality, and cost must be considered in combination; all measures for increasing production and practicing thrift must pay attention to practical results, and strictly prevent the kind of formalistic and one-sided "increased production" and "thrift." In the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, we must also earnestly pay attention to safe production.

Regarding construction and municipal engineering, the meeting believed that engineering projects should be re-examined based on the existing financial resources, material resources, and the central government's spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, and projects that can be not built or postponed should be reduced and postponed in order to concentrate efforts to ensure the completion of those necessary and possible projects.

The meeting requested that all relevant departments improve their work in accordance with the State Council's instructions on further carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, overcome the work style of being divorced from reality and the masses, and earnestly strengthen the ideological and political education of workers and staff, so that the campaign to increase production and practice thrift can be carried out more widely and deeply and persist, and earnestly achieve the goal of "rectification and production not being neglected."

At the end of the meeting, Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a self-criticism on the issue of the excessively high standards of the Municipal Party Committee office building.

### 中共北京市委常委会会议强调  增产节约必须贯彻全面观点  严格防止形式主义，全面兼顾增产、节约、质量和成本

    中共北京市委常委会会议强调
    增产节约必须贯彻全面观点
    严格防止形式主义，全面兼顾增产、节约、质量和成本
    本报特约新华社6日讯　中共北京市委常委会5日举行会议，检查和讨论了北京市开展增产节约运动的情况、问题和今后改进的意见。
    会议认为北京市的增产节约运动已经取得了一定的成绩。在原料和生产任务都很不足的情况下，绝大多数工矿企业超额完成了生产计划。四十个中央国营厂矿第一季度完成了总产值计划的107％。地方国营工业1至5月，完成了总产值计划的107.3％。在节约原材料方面，也有许多成绩。
    会议指出：当前的增产节约运动在许多方面是很不深入的。有些部门在领导增产节约运动中，存在着脱离实际的形式主义和严重的官僚主义的毛病，只满足于开个会，发个号召，不深入了解情况，不具体解决问题。有些地方国营企业和公私合营企业，只是作了增产节约计划，并没有向群众中贯彻执行，没有在职工群众中真正发动一个广泛的增产节约运动。最近期间，有些部门因为忙于整风，更是放松了对生产的领导。因此有些工厂的增产节约运动已经开始出现了停滞的现象。会议认为，目前某些工业品的质量，是不能令人满意的。据第一、第二地方工业局一百一十种产品的统计，质量上升的有四十五种，稳定的有四十二种，
  下降的有二十三种。少数工厂还出现了一些严重的质量事故。会议特别指出：基本建设中的问题很多，今年有完不成任务的危险。这主要是由于材料供应和材料供应制度上有许多困难和问题，使许多建筑工地上出现了停工待料或因材料不足而陷于半死不活的状态。另外也是由于某些单位的经营思想和管理制度有问题，致使不必要的、可以避免的延误工期的现象很多。如果不立即设法改变这种状态，许多重要的基本建设任务将会无法完成；或者基本建设的工作量虽然可以完成许多，而能够交付使用的成品则不多，这将要造成极大的浪费。会议指出：今年以来，基本建设中的质量事故不断发生，有的相当严重。在增产节约运动中，应当切实注意保证和提高产品质量。
    会议认为，在目前许多原材料供应不足的情况下，在开展增产节约运动中特别注意节约原材料是完全必要的，但是同时必须强调在保证产品质量的条件下节约原材料。目前在节约原材料方面已经发生的一些只是片面节约而忽视产品质量的作法，是十分错误的。有的所谓节约原材料，实际上是一种变相的偷工减料，这样做的结果，不仅不能达到节约的目的，相反的会给国家财产和人民生活带来更大的损失。会议要求各工矿企业在增产节约运动中，必须贯彻全面的观点，增产、节约、质量、成本必须结合起来考虑；一切增产节约的措施，都必须注意实际效果，严格防止那种形式主义的、片面的“增产”“节约”。在增产节约运动中，还必须切实注意安全生产。
    关于建筑和市政工程，会议认为应根据现有的财力、物力和中央勤俭建国的精神，重新审查工程项目，削减、推迟那些可以不建或缓建的工程，以便集中力量保证建成那些必需而且可能完成的工程。
    会议要求各有关部门根据国务院关于进一步开展增产节约运动的指示，切实改进工作，克服脱离实际、脱离群众的作风，并且切实加强职工的思想政治教育，使增产节约运动更加广泛、更加深入地开展起来并坚持下去，认真地做到整风生产两不误。
    会议最后，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁对市委办公楼标准过高的问题作了检讨。
