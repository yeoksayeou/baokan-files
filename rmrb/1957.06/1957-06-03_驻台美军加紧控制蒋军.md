Xinhua News Agency Report: The U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan are intensifying their control over Chiang Kai-shek's army officers and soldiers.

The U.S. Taiwan Defense Command has now become the highest command institution of Chiang's army. The power of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Chiang's army is also growing, controlling all major aspects of Chiang's army. U.S. advisory groups are stationed in the army, divisions, air force wings, and navy fleet-level command headquarters of Chiang's army. The army regiments, air force squadrons, navy ships, and various military schools also have resident U.S. advisors. U.S. advisors directly participate in and command the training and various exercises of Chiang's army. The movements of Chiang's army, the actions of major naval vessels, and the supply of ordnance, ammunition, fuel, and military supplies must be approved by U.S. advisors. The transfer and appointment of officers above the rank of middle-level in Chiang's army must be approved by them. The United States is also carrying out conspiracies to support and win over officers in Chiang's army, attempting to directly cultivate more pro-American forces in Chiang's army.

American soldiers are three ranks higher than anyone they meet in Chiang's army, and even senior officers in Chiang's army are subject to their instructions. They "do what they say," and if they are slightly unhappy, they rudely reprimand and scold Chiang's army officers and soldiers, or submit "memoranda" asking the Chiang Kai-shek authorities to give punishments.

Incidents of American soldiers molesting and insulting the wives and daughters of Chiang's army officers occur from time to time, and some Chiang's army officers have been victimized to the point of family breakdown. Chiang's army officers and soldiers are filled with hatred for the shameless behavior of the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan. In many places in Taiwan, incidents of Chiang's army officers and soldiers beating unreasonable American soldiers have occurred. Anti-American sentiment is growing among Chiang's army officers and soldiers.

    驻台美军加紧控制蒋军
    据新华社讯　驻在台湾的美军加紧控制蒋军官兵。
    美军协防台湾司令部现在已经成为蒋军的最高指挥机构。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在蒋军中的权力也越来越大，控制了蒋军的一切主要方面。蒋军陆军部队的军、师和空军联队、海军舰队一级司令部都设有美军顾问小组，陆军团、空军大队、海军舰只上以及各军事学校也都有常驻的美军顾问。蒋军的训练和各种演习，都有美国顾问直接参与和指挥。蒋军的调动，海军主要舰只的行动，以及军械、弹药、油料、军需品的供应，都要经过美国顾问的同意或批准。蒋军中级以上官员的调动和任免，要经过他们同意。美国还在蒋军中进行扶植、拉拢军官的阴谋活动，企图在蒋军中直接培养更加亲美的势力。
    美国军人在蒋军中逢人官大三等，蒋军中的高级军官也要受他们指使摆布。他们“言出必行”，稍有不顺心，就对蒋军官兵横蛮地斥责谩骂，或是提出“备忘录”，叫蒋军当局给予处分。
    美国军人调戏和污辱蒋军军官妻女的事件时有发生，有些蒋军军官被害得妻离子散。蒋军官兵对于驻台美军的无耻行为，无不恨之入骨。台湾的许多地方，都曾经发生蒋军官兵殴打蛮横无理的美国军人的事件。反美情绪正在蒋军官兵中日益滋长。
