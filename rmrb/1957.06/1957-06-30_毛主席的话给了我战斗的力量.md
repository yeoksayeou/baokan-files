Chairman Mao's words are a guiding light of immense brilliance, illuminating my eyes, illuminating my heart, clarifying the path forward, and giving me unparalleled fighting power!

I should say that when contention and blooming developed into a great blooming and contending, and then turned into "sole blooming and contending," I was somewhat confused. I have never wavered in my belief in the Party's leadership and the socialist road; but between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, I could not draw a clear line, and I had no idea how to deal with poisonous weeds. The anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies that emerged in newspapers and at meetings made me very indignant. I really wanted to speak, to speak from my heart. I wanted to speak from my personal experience and understanding, to say what road I had come from, what we had been fighting for for decades, what kind of life we are living today, and what our socialist prospects should be like in the future. Eight years is not a long time, have you forgotten the miserable and painful life under the rule of the reactionaries? Eight years is not a long time, can't you see the great changes and achievements in every corner of the motherland? If you have lost your eyes, you should hear the laughter of the people; if your ears are deaf, you should see the beautiful scenery before you. If your nerves are numb and your conscience has been sold, the Party and the people can also help you regain your senses and feelings, so that you gradually become a person. But these words were all spoken to myself in sleepless nights. I didn't know where the worries came from, fearing that my words would be labeled as preventing blooming and contending. It should be said that at that time, my mood was very bitter and also very indignant.

Chairman Mao's short speech when receiving representatives of the Communist Youth League made me excited, made me realize that all anti-socialist remarks and actions were wrong, and drew a line for me between right and wrong, good and evil. But as for how to deal with those wrong and malicious words, I thought I still couldn't "act rashly." I put down my weapons and stopped moving forward on the ideological struggle front; while those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements became even more rampant in their attacks, drilling into every corner to release open and hidden arrows, vainly trying to shake the socialist motherland of 600 million people. From attacking the Party, attacking socialism to slandering individuals, they wanted to eliminate the Communist Party, kill all Communists, and drag the broad masses of people into the miserable mire. They were uncovering lids everywhere, setting fires everywhere, trying to subvert the people's revolutionary cause with despicable and shameless conspiracies and tricks. I believe in the people, believe in the Communist Party that is connected to the people by flesh and blood, believe in Chairman Mao—listening to Chairman Mao's words and following the Communist Party will never be wrong.

Chairman Mao's words finally resounded throughout New China. I read them repeatedly, allowing me to find the highest truth between right and wrong, making me realize the six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds, and I also found a guide to action: "If there are mistakes, they must be criticized; if there are poisonous weeds, we must fight them." As literary workers, we ask the Party to strengthen leadership and resolutely take the socialist road. For all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution, are hostile to and undermine socialist construction, those enemies of the people, we must resolutely fight them. We must hold high the banner of socialism, under the leadership of the Party, bravely move forward, so that the literary cause of New China becomes a part of the Party's cause, so that we put all our strength into defending socialism and building the great cause of socialism.

### 毛主席的话给了我战斗的力量

　　毛主席的话给了我战斗的力量
　　靳以
    毛主席的话是光芒万丈的指路明灯，它照亮了我的眼睛，照亮了我的心，照清了前进的道路，给了我无比旺盛的战斗的力量！
    我应该说，当争鸣齐放发展为大鸣大放又转为“独鸣独放”的时候，我是有一些困惑的。对于党的领导，社会主义的道路，我从来也没有动摇过；可是在香花毒草之间，我划不清一条界线，对毒草应如何对待我也心中无数。在报纸上，在会议上冒出来的那些反党反社会主义的谬论使我很愤慨，我真想说话，说出我心里的话。我要从个人的经历和体会中说出真心话：我是从什么道路上走过来的，几十年来我们争的是什么？今天我们过的是什么日子，将来我们的社会主义美景又该如何？八年并不是一个长时间，难道在反动派统治下的悲惨与痛苦的生活就忘记了？八年并不是一个长时间，难道你看不到祖国各个角落的伟大的改变与成就？如果你失去眼睛，你该听到人民的笑声；如果你的耳朵聋了，你该看到眼前的一片美景。如果你的神经麻木不仁，良心出卖了；党和人民也能帮助你恢复知觉和感觉，使你逐渐成为一个人。可是这些话，都是我在不眠的长夜独言独语，也不知道从那里来的顾虑，生怕我的话被戴上了阻止鸣放的帽子。应该说，那时我的心情是很苦闷，也很激愤的。
    毛主席在接见共青团代表时的简短讲话，使我感到兴奋，使我认识到一切反社会主义的言论和行动都是错误的，在是非善恶之间为我划了一条线。但对那些错误的恶言恶语应如何对待，自以为还不能“轻举妄动”，我放下了武器，在思想斗争阵地上停足不前；而那些反党、反社会主义分子们更加猖狂进攻，钻到各个角落去放出明枪暗箭，妄想摇撼六亿人民的社会主义祖国。从对党的攻击，对社会主义的攻击到对个人的诬蔑，他们要消灭共产党，杀尽共产党人，把广大的人民牵到悲惨的泥坑去。他们到处揭盖，到处点火，想用卑鄙无耻的阴谋诡计来颠覆人民的革命事业。我相信人民，相信和人民血肉相联的共产党，相信毛主席——听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，永远也不会错误的。
    毛主席的话终于响彻了新中国，我反复地读着，让我在是非之间找到了最高的真理，使我认识到辨别香花毒草的六大标准，我也找到了行动的指南：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争”。做为一个文学工作者，我们要求党加强领导，坚决走社会主义道路。对于一切反抗社会主义革命，敌视和破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，那些人民的敌人，我们要坚决与之斗争。我们要高举社会主义大旗，在党的领导之下，奋勇前进，使新中国的文学事业，成为党的事业的一部分，使我们把全部力量投入捍卫社会主义和建设社会主义的伟大事业中。
