Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held three consecutive enlarged meetings from May 27th to 31st, inviting members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, responsible persons from relevant units, and relevant individuals to jointly discuss the establishment of provincial-level Hui and Zhuang autonomous regions.

After consultation and discussion, the participants unanimously agreed to establish the Hui Autonomous Region in northeastern Gansu and the Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi, as well as the zoning plans for these two autonomous regions. The meeting approved the explanatory reports submitted to the meeting by the Gansu delegation and the Guangxi delegation, who came to Beijing to consult on the establishment of these two autonomous regions. When the meeting's moderator, CPPCC National Committee Vice Chairman Li Weihan, summarized the consensus already reached, he said: The plan for the two autonomous regions has been unanimously agreed upon, and the names and some specific issues can still be considered and negotiated at leisure.

Before the meeting began its discussion, Sun Diancai, deputy head of the Gansu delegation, and Wang Feng, deputy director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, gave explanatory reports and speeches on the zoning plan and deliberation process for the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region. Chen Zaili, head of the Guangxi delegation, also gave an explanation on the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Sun Diancai said: According to the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the leading organs of Gansu Province have successively invited more than 1,700 Hui and Han people over the past year to hold various symposiums on the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region, extensively listening to opinions from all parties, and conducting serious and careful research. After repeated consultations, various different opinions gradually converged, especially on the issue of zoning, where opinions were initially more divided, but finally, everyone adhered to the spirit of seeking truth from facts to reach a solution. At the joint meeting of the Gansu Provincial People's Committee and the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC held from May 2nd to 3rd this year, everyone unanimously approved the plan proposed by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC on the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region in northeastern Gansu. The zoning scope of the Hui Autonomous Region in this plan includes the current Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province, the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County and Longde County of the Pingliang Special District, a total of seventeen counties and the two cities of Yinchuan City in the Yinchuan Special District and Wuzhong City in the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The total area of the region is approximately 77,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 1,728,000, of which the Hui people account for more than one-third.

Sun Diancai said: We believe that the plan currently adopted is relatively realistic and feasible. Given the large-scale dispersion and small-scale clustering of the Hui people in Gansu, it is a relatively good plan and is also easily accepted by the vast majority of the Hui and Han people. However, in this plan, the Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County and more than 80,000 Hui people in the Pingliang Special District near the autonomous region were not included. This is because, considering all aspects, the Hui people took the initiative to propose not including them, and we also believe it is better not to include them.

Wang Feng said: The national Hui population is more than 3.5 million, making it one of the more populous ethnic minorities. Now that the Mongolian and Uyghur ethnic groups have successively established autonomous regions, Tibet has established an autonomous region preparatory committee, and Guangxi is brewing the establishment of a Zhuang Autonomous Region, if the Hui ethnic group does not establish a provincial-level autonomous region, it will not be commensurate with its status in the big family of the motherland. Among the more than 3.5 million Hui people in the country, more than 1.1 million live in Gansu. Compared with other provinces and regions in the country, establishing a Hui Autonomous Region in Gansu is the most appropriate. Wang Feng then explained and clarified some of the concerns raised by various parties during the process of deliberation and discussion in Gansu.

Chen Zaili said: After the Guangxi delegation returned to the province in March to participate in the consultation and discussion in Beijing on the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, it conducted extensive dissemination, organized symposiums including people from all parties, and did a lot of work. From April to May, people's congresses of various cities and counties in Guangxi Province convened meetings to formally discuss the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region. Among the 13,071 representatives attending and observing the meetings, except for a few representatives who disagreed with the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region and a few representatives who disagreed with the name "Zhuang" for the autonomous region, the other representatives fully supported it. This shows that the establishment of a provincial-level Zhuang autonomous region is fully in line with the common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi.

The meeting then proceeded to discussion. The following people spoke at the meeting: CPPCC National Committee Vice Chairmen Huang Yanpei and Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee members Zhang Zhizhong, Wang Baozhen, Liu Wang Liming, Chen Qiyou, Ye Gongchuo, Wei Lihuang, Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan), Huang Qixiang, Cai Tingkai, Standing Committee members of the National People's Congress Li Shucheng, Huang Shaohong, Chen Qiyuan, Zhang Yunyi, relevant CPPCC members Liang Shuming, Qin Yizhi, relevant individuals Chen Cisheng, Zhao Keren, Huang Changfang, Ma Jian (Hui), members of the Gansu delegation Wu Hongbin (Hui, CPPCC Standing Committee member), Yang Ziheng, Ma Tengai (Hui), Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), deputy heads of the Guangxi delegation Lin Hu and Lei Peihong, members Mo Xuguang (Dong), Lin Huanping, Huang Mengxing, Feng Yingcai, Chen Peiyuan, Zhang Jingning, Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee Liu Geping (Hui), Deputy Directors of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China Sa Kongliao (Mongolian), Gan Chunlei (Hui), etc.

During the discussion of the Hui Autonomous Region plan, Wang Feng made supplementary explanations to the questions raised by Liang Shuming, Li Shucheng, and others regarding the zoning plan. They asked why the Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County and more than 80,000 Hui people in the Pingliang Special District near the Hui Autonomous Region were not included in the autonomous region. Wang Feng said: During the discussion, some people also suggested including all counties in the Pingliang Special District in the autonomous region. At that time, everyone considered the ethnic relations in this region. In history, especially in the last hundred years, due to the instigation of the reactionary ruling class, there have been many ethnic killings, and the Hui and Han ethnic groups have a deep divide. Although the relationship between the Hui and Han ethnic groups has greatly improved since liberation, it will still take a considerable period of time to completely eliminate the divide. Therefore, the Hui people took the initiative to propose that it would be better not to include the counties in the Pingliang Special District. Since the counties in the Pingliang Special District are not included in the autonomous region, if the Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County is included in the Hui Autonomous Region, the Pingliang Special District in eastern Gansu and the entire western Gansu will be divided into two halves. This is the main reason why Zhangjiachuan was not included in the autonomous region. The more than 80,000 Hui people in the Pingliang Special District mainly live in Pingliang City and Pingliang County. Pingliang City is the location of the Pingliang Special Commissioner's Office and is the cultural and economic center of the Pingliang Special District. If these more than 80,000 Hui people are included in the autonomous region, Pingliang City must also be transferred to the Hui Autonomous Region. This would cause the Pingliang Special District to lose its cultural and economic center. Therefore, these more than 80,000 Hui people were not included in the autonomous region.

Huang Yanpei said: I have not been to Gansu and do not understand the situation. However, I have relatives in Gansu, and I know from talking with relatives that the relationship between the Hui and Han ethnic groups was very bad before liberation. Since liberation, the relationship between the Hui and Han ethnic groups has greatly improved. Therefore, I agree with this plan. The establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region can consolidate the feelings that the Hui and Han ethnic groups have had in recent years. Now that everyone has no objections to the plan, I personally believe that it can be established sooner.

Zhang Zhizhong said: I have had some work relations with Gansu before and after liberation, and I agree with the plan to establish the Hui Autonomous Region. I have talked with Hui friends about this issue in the past. At that time, because the time was not ripe, I think it is very appropriate to merge the two autonomous prefectures, one special district, and two counties to establish an autonomous region now.

During the discussion of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Liang Shuming said: Based on his observations in Guangxi, the timing for establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region is not yet ripe. He said that grassroots farmers do not have many opinions on the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, but some intellectuals still have many concerns. He advocated that more detailed and in-depth publicity and deliberation work should be carried out. He criticized the publicity work at the grassroots level as simply copying the documents from above, without combining the characteristics of various places and without explaining the ideological concerns of the masses.

Zhao Keren said: The timing is basically ripe. It is not true to say that there are no different opinions, but the majority of the masses agree with the "merged plan." He said that it is necessary to continue to carry out publicity work during the preparation period regarding the different opinions and ideological concerns among the masses. Zhao Keren also pointed out that publicity work cannot be generalized and should be tailored to specific situations, because the situation varies from place to place.

Huang Shaohong said: He originally advocated the "divided plan" at the CPPCC meeting in March, but later agreed to the "merged plan," and still agrees to the "merged plan" now. However, regarding the name of the autonomous region, he advocated adopting "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region." He said that retaining the word "Province" can take care of the national feelings of the Han people in Guangxi. Secondly, he proposed that the autonomous regulations of the autonomous region should be drafted first, and the content of the autonomous regulations should be specific, so that the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups can cooperate well.

Chen Qiyuan said: It is more appropriate to use the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region." The names "Guangxi Autonomous Region" and "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region" are both incorrect. Because the name "Guangxi Autonomous Region" does not indicate which ethnic group is practicing autonomy, and in the name "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region," "Province" contradicts "Autonomous Region."

Lin Hu expressed his agreement with Chen Zaili's speech. He said that the publicity work in the past few months has been very successful. After deliberation, everyone chose the merged plan from the original several different plans. Of course, a few people still have opinions, and publicity and explanation work should continue to be carried out in the future.

Wei Lihuang said: If it were in the old society, I would not have agreed to the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region. Because the old society was based on private ownership, after the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions, the phenomenon of ethnic groups moving and competing for property may occur. Now it is a new society, private ownership has been broken, and the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions will not cause the above-mentioned phenomenon. Therefore, I fully agree.

Huang Qixiang said: The word "Province" in the name of the autonomous region can be omitted. Having the two words "Guangxi" can take care of the feelings of the Han people.

After everyone spoke, Huang Shaohong continued: I agree to the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, and I agree with the "merged plan," but regarding the name issue, I advocate using "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region." "Province" has a history of hundreds of years, and I am nostalgic for the word "Province." In addition to this, what is more important is the issue of the political rights of the Han people after the establishment of the autonomous region. The consequences of this issue must be considered, and this matter should be done well in the preparatory work for the autonomous region. He said that the time is not yet ripe and that there should be a deliberation process to thoroughly understand some issues. In his speech, Huang Shaohong had different opinions on some of the points in Li Weihan's "Some Views and Opinions on the Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region." Li Weihan made explanations at the end.

At the end of the discussion, Li Weihan summarized the various opinions. He said: Everyone agrees to the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region and the Zhuang Autonomous Region, and agrees to use the "merged plan" for the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region. Regarding the issue of the names of the two autonomous regions, there are different opinions and debates, and we can continue to consider them at leisure. We recommend that the Gansu delegation and the Guangxi delegation submit the plans for the establishment of the two autonomous regions to the State Council, and after going through legislative procedures, prepare for the preparatory work. During the preparation work, ensure that all issues are ripe for resolution. Li Weihan asked the Secretary-General of the CPPCC National Committee to take charge of the establishment of two groups to continue discussing the relevant issues of establishing the two autonomous regions. He said that members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC Standing Committee, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and relevant individuals are free to participate in the discussions of these two groups.

    政协全国委员会连续举行三次扩大会议
    赞同建立回族自治区和僮族自治区
    关于名称以及一些具体问题，将从容考虑继续协商
    新华社3日讯　政协全国委员会常务委员会在5月27日到31日连续举行三次扩大会议，邀请全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、有关单位负责人和有关人士，共同讨论省一级的回族自治地方和僮族自治地方的建立问题。
    与会者经过协商和讨论后，一致赞同建立甘肃东北部回族自治区和广西僮族自治区以及这两个自治区的区划方案。会议赞同来京协商建立这两个自治区的甘肃代表团和广西代表团向会议提出的说明报告。会议主持人、政协全国委员会副主席李维汉在归纳大家已经取得一致的意见的时候说：关于两个自治区的方案已取得了一致同意，至于名称以及一些具体问题，还可以从容考虑，继续协商。
    会议在开始讨论前，甘肃代表团副团长孙殿才、中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任汪锋，先后就建立回族自治区的区划方案和酝酿经过作了说明报告和发言；广西代表团团长陈再励也对建立僮族自治区的问题作了说明。
    孙殿才说：根据中共中央的倡议，甘肃省领导机关一年来先后邀请一千七百多位回、汉族人士，就建立回族自治区问题举行过各种座谈会，广泛听取各方面的意见，并且作了认真仔细的研究。经过反复协商，各种不同意见才逐渐趋于一致，特别是对于区划问题，起初意见比较分歧，最后大家本着实事求是的精神才得到解决。在今年5月2日到3日召开的甘肃省人民委员会和政协甘肃省委员会联席会议上，大家一致通过了中共甘肃省委提出的关于在甘肃东北部建立回族自治区的方案。这个方案中的回族自治区的区划范围包括现在的甘肃省银川专区、吴忠回族自治州、固原回族自治州和平凉专区的泾源回族自治县和隆德县，共十七个县和银川专区的银川市、吴忠回族自治州的吴忠市两个市。全区面积约有七万七千多平方公里，人口约一百七十二万八千多人，其中回族占三分之一以上。
    孙殿才说：我们认为，现在通过的方案，比较现实易行，在甘肃回族大分散、小聚居的情况下，是一个比较好的方案，同时也容易为回、汉民族绝大多数人民所接受。但是在这个方案中，靠近自治区的张家川回族自治县和平凉专区的八万多回民没有划进去，这是因为考虑到各方面的情况，回族人士主动地提出不划，我们也认为以不划为宜。
    汪锋说：全国回族人口有三百五十多万，是少数民族中人口比较多的一个民族，当着蒙古族、维吾尔族已经先后建立了自治区，西藏已经建立了自治区筹备委员会，广西也正在酝酿建立僮族自治区的时候，如果回族不建立一个省一级的自治地方，是不能够同他在祖国大家庭的地位相适应的。而在全国三百五十多万回族人口中，居住在甘肃境内的就有一百一十多万人，在全国回族居住分散的情况下，甘肃和其他省区相比，在甘肃建立回族自治区是最合适的。汪锋接着把在甘肃酝酿和讨论过程中各方面谈到的一些顾虑，作了解释和说明。
    陈再励说：广西代表团在3月间来北京参加关于建立僮族自治区问题的协商讨论回省后，进行了广泛的传达，组织了包括各方面人士的座谈，做了许多工作。在4月到5月，广西省各市、县人民代表大会普遍召开会议，正式讨论关于建立僮族自治区的问题。各地出席和列席会议的一万三千零七十一位代表，除个别代表不同意建立僮族自治区和几位代表不同意自治区冠以“僮族”名称外，其他代表都完全拥护。这说明成立省一级的僮族自治地方，是完全符合于广西各民族人民的共同愿望的。
    会议接着进行讨论。先后在会上发言的有：政协全国委员会副主席黄炎培、章伯钧，常务委员张治中、王葆真、刘王立明、陈其尤、叶恭绰、卫立煌、喜饶嘉错（藏）、黄琪翔、蔡廷锴，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员李书城、黄绍竑、陈其瑗、张云逸，有关政协委员梁漱溟、覃异之，有关人士陈此生、赵可任、黄昶芳、马坚（回），甘肃代表团团员吴鸿宾（回、政协常务委员）、杨子恒、马腾霭（回）、黄正清（藏），广西代表团副团长林虎、雷沛鸿，团员莫虚光（侗）、林焕平、黄梦醒、冯英才、陈培元、张景宁，全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平（回），中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任萨空了（蒙古）、甘春雷（回）等。
    在讨论回族自治区方案的时候，汪锋对梁漱溟、李书城等就区划方案提出的问题作了补充说明。他们问，靠近回族自治区的张家川回族自治县和平凉专区的八万多回民，为什么不划进自治区。汪锋说：在讨论中，也曾经有人提议把平凉专区各县划入自治区。当时大家考虑到这个地区的民族关系，在历史上特别是近百年来，由于反动统治阶级的挑拨，有过多次的民族仇杀，回汉民族间隔阂较深。解放后回、汉民族关系虽然有了很大的改善，但是完全消除隔阂还需要经过相当的时期。因此回族人士主动提出不划平凉专区各县为好。既然平凉专区各县不划入自治区，如果把张家川回族自治县划入回族自治区，就把甘肃东部的平凉专区和整个甘肃西部分割成两半，这就是没有把张家川划入自治区的主要原因。平凉专区的八万多回族主要散居在平凉市和平凉县。平凉市是平凉专署所在地，是平凉专区的文化、经济中心，如果将这八万多回族划入自治区，平凉市也要划归回族自治区，这样使平凉专区失掉了文化、经济中心，因此这八万多回族没有划入自治区。
    黄炎培说：我没有去过甘肃，对情况不了解。但我和甘肃攀了亲，从亲戚谈话中知道甘肃解放前回汉民族关系很不好。解放以来，回汉民族关系有很大的改进。因此，我同意这个方案。成立回族自治区，可以把回、汉民族这几年已有的感情巩固起来。现在大家对方案没有异议，我个人认为可以早点建立起来。
    张治中说：解放前和解放后我和甘肃在工作上有些关系，我同意建立回族自治区的方案。过去我和回族朋友谈过这个问题，那时因时机不成熟，现在将两个自治州、一个专区和两县合并成立自治区，我认为是很适当的。
    在讨论广西僮族自治区的时候，梁漱溟说：根据他在广西的见闻，成立僮族自治区的时机还不够成熟。他说基层农民对建立僮族自治区意见不多，可是部分知识分子还有不少顾虑。他主张还要细致深入地进行宣传酝酿工作。他批评基层中的宣传工作只是照搬上面的文件，没有结合各地的特点，没有针对群众的思想顾虑作解释。
    赵可任说：时机基本上是成熟的了。说没有不同意见，是不符合事实的，但大多数群众都同意“合的方案”。他说对于群众中的不同意见和思想顾虑，需要在筹备期间继续进行宣传工作。赵可任也指出宣传工作不能一般化，要针对具体情况，因为各地情况不一。
    黄绍竑说：他在政协3月举行的会议上原来主张“分的方案”，后来同意“合的方案”，现在也仍然同意“合的方案”。但是对于自治区的名称，他主张采用“广西省僮族自治区”，他说保留一个“省”字可以照顾广西汉人的民族感情。其次，他提出先把自治区自治条例拟订出来，自治条例的内容要具体，这样汉、僮两族才好合作。
    陈其瑗说：采用“广西僮族自治区”这个名称比较恰当，“广西自治区”、“广西省僮族自治区”等名称都不对。因为，“广西自治区”这个名称没有指出是那个民族在实行自治，“广西省僮族自治区”名称中“省”同“自治区”是矛盾的。
    林虎表示同意陈再励的发言。他说，这几个月来的宣传工作很有成绩。原来的几个不同方案，经过酝酿后，大家选择了合的方案。少数人当然还有意见，今后还应该进行宣传解释的工作。
    卫立煌说：如果在旧社会，我是不赞成建立僮族自治区的。因为旧社会是私有制，建立民族自治区后，可能发生民族之间互相搬家和互争财权的现象，现在是新社会，打破了私有制，建立民族自治区不会发生上述现象，因此我完全赞成。
    黄琪翔说：自治区名称中“省”字可以不要，有“广西”两字就可以照顾汉族的感情了。
    黄绍竑在大家发言后接着说：我同意建立僮族自治区，同意“合的方案”，但是关于名称问题，我主张用“广西省僮族自治区”，“省”有几百年的历史，我是留恋“省”字的。除此之外，更重要的是自治区建立后汉族的政治权利问题，要考虑这个问题的后果，在自治区的筹备工作中，应该作好这件事。他说现在还没有水到渠成，应该有一个酝酿过程，把一些问题搞透彻。黄绍竑在发言中对李维汉“关于建立僮族自治区问题的一些看法和意见”中的若干论点有不同意见。李维汉在最后都作了说明。
    在讨论结束时，李维汉对各种意见作了归纳。他说：大家都赞成建立回族自治区和僮族自治区，对建立僮族自治区赞成用“合的方案”。关于两个自治区的名称问题，大家有不同意见的争论，可以继续从容考虑。我们建议甘肃代表团和广西代表团将建立两个自治区的方案提交国务院，经过立法手续后，再作筹备工作。在筹备工作中，使一切问题作到瓜熟蒂落。李维汉请政协全国委员会秘书长主持成立两个小组，以便继续讨论建立两个自治地方的有关问题。他说政协常委会常务委员和全国人民代表大会常委会委员和有关人士，都可以自由参加这两个小组的讨论。
