    Letters to the Editor
    The speech of mine published on page 7 of your newspaper on June 8th differs greatly from the spirit and language of my speech at the time. I did not say in general that all of our country's science could not catch up with the world's advanced level in more than a decade. What I said was that, during the reorganization of departments and institutes, the leadership said these kinds of things to the old intellectuals who were transferred to completely new positions at the time: If a person is transferred to a new job, if he is willing to obey the assignment, he can become a minor expert in a few months, and in a few years, maybe one or two years, become a major expert. I believe it is difficult to achieve the goal of catching up with the world level within ten years only by relying on people who start from scratch. According to my common sense, in some deeper sciences, a person who starts from scratch has only stepped onto the path of a certain science in ten years, and it is impossible to talk about catching up with the world level. However, an old intellectual with a certain foundation in a certain science is very likely to catch up with the world level within ten years if given sufficient conditions and support, and if he is willing to work hard and has talent, especially in a socialist country with all kinds of superior conditions.

    来函照登
    贵报6月8日第七版刊登的我的发言，与我当时发言的精神和语言很有出入。我并没有拢统的说我国的一切科学都不能在十几年内赶上世界的先进水平。我说的是，在院系调整时领导上对当时被调到一种崭新岗位上的旧知识分子说过这类的话：把一个人调换一个新工作，如果他肯服从分配的话，就可在几个月内成一小专家，在几年内，也可能在一二年之内，成一大专家。我认为专靠从头学起的人来要在十年之内赶上世界水平是很难作到的。据我的常识，在一些较深的科学上，一个从头学起的人在十年内仅仅踏上了某一门科学之路，谈不到赶上世界水平。可是一个对某门科学具有一定基础的旧知识分子，就很可能在十年内赶上世界水平，如果予以足够的条件和支持，而他肯努力又具有才质的话，何况在社会主义的国家里面具有种种优越的条件。　李景汉
