　　Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 26th saying that the US proposal that all countries' ships have the right to "free and innocent passage" in the Gulf of Aqaba is a violation of international law.

　　The statement said that the right of free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba is not applicable at the present time when Arab countries and Israel are still in a state of war. The US attitude of "favoring Israel against the interests of Arab countries" will only "exacerbate the tension in the region."

　　According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, Saudi Arabia, in a note to the United States on June 26th, announced that it does not agree to allowing non-Arab countries to enjoy the right to navigate in the Gulf of Aqaba.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Minister of State Akil accused Israel on the 26th of creating an atmosphere in preparation for aggression against Syria. He said that Syria is fully prepared to counter Israeli aggression.

　　Recently, shooting incidents have occurred continuously on the Syrian-Israeli border, and the Syrian military authorities have repeatedly filed accusations. According to reports from Israel, Israel has implemented measures close to a wartime system in the border area.

　　美国扬言各国有权使用亚喀巴湾
    叙利亚指责美国偏袒以色列
    以色列为准备侵略制造气氛
    据新华社27日讯  叙利亚外交部发言人6月26日发表声明说，美国提出的所谓各国船只都有权在亚喀巴湾“自由和无害通航”的观点是违反国际法的。
    声明说，亚喀巴湾的自由航行权在目前阿拉伯国家和以色列还处在战争状态的情况下是不适用的。美国这种“偏袒以色列反对阿拉伯国家利益”的态度，只会“促使这个地区的紧张局势加剧”。
    据开罗电台广播沙特阿拉伯在6月26日致美国的一项照会中宣布，它不同意让非阿拉伯国家享有在亚喀巴湾通航的权利。
    新华社27日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚国务部长阿基勒26日指责以色列为了准备侵略叙利亚而制造气氛。他说，叙利亚有充分的准备来反击以色列的侵略。
    最近，叙利亚—以色列边境连续发生射击事件，叙利亚军事当局已经一再提出指控。据来自以色列的消息说，以色列在边境地区已经实行了近乎战争体制的措施。
