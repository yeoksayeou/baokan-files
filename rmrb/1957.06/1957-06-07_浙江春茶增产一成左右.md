Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Zhejiang's spring tea picking and production has concluded. According to estimates from relevant departments, this year's total spring tea production in the province has increased by approximately 10% compared to last year. As of May 25th, the amount of tea purchased by the state has increased by more than 20,000 dan compared to the same period last year.
    From late April to early May, Zhejiang's tea-producing areas experienced continuous rainy days, which caused the tea leaves to grow quickly. To prevent the tea leaves from becoming coarse and old, the tea farmers put forward the slogans "Seize the harvest and production" and "Every leaf down the mountain, every leaf back home." Tens of thousands of women braved the rain to pick tea on the mountains. Many tea areas promoted advanced tea-making experiences, thereby shortening the tea picking time. The tea produced has an exceptionally rich aroma, and many regions have seen unprecedented top-grade tea.

    浙江春茶增产一成左右
    据新华社讯　浙江省春茶采制结束。据有关部门估计，今年全省春茶产量比去年增加10％左右。到5月25日止，国家收购的茶叶，比去年同期增加两万多担。
    浙江省的茶区，4月下旬到5月上旬，连日阴雨。茶叶生长很快。为了不使茶叶粗老，茶农们提出了“抢采抢制”和“片片下山、 叶叶还家”的口号，数以万计的妇女冒雨上山采茶，不少茶区推广了先进的制茶经验，因而缩短了采茶时间，制出的茶叶香气格外浓郁，许多地区都出现了从未有过的特级茶。
