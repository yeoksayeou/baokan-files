Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 3rd Dispatch: An official spokesman announced that the Dutch government is currently studying the "new situation" created by Britain's unilateral relaxation of trade restrictions with China, and it will make a "final decision" on this issue within this week.

Some people in the Netherlands believe that, for economic reasons, especially due to fear of competition mainly from Britain and Japan, the Netherlands will have to follow Britain's example.

Dutch newspapers generally believe that, on the issue of trade with China, Britain's attitude is much more "realistic" than Washington's.
