    "Family Village"
    One evening, Xie Leqiong, the family propaganda committee member of the Tunnel 18th Team of the Second Railway Engineering Section, told us something fresh. She said that in April 1956, after the engineering team completed the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project, they moved from the Baishuijiang construction site in Shaanxi to the Baihua District construction site in Yibin County. There were very few farmers near this construction site, and no houses. Workers and their families were crammed into temporary sheds, which was inconvenient in every way. The families wanted to put up temporary thatched houses like they did at the Baishuijiang construction site. However, the local farmers were unwilling to sell them bamboo and straw.
    Xie Leqiong said: This made everyone anxious. What to do? Our families were not discouraged, nor did they complain. The family committee discussed with the trade union and the administration, wanting to gain the support of the farmer brothers in order to build thatched houses. The families organized themselves, helping the farmers with their work during the day and putting on plays and parties for the farmers in the evening. The farmers were moved. They were all willing to take out their own bamboo, wood, and straw, and were willing to help the families build thatched houses. At this time, the village cadres also helped the families designate Dinghui Temple as the building base. Dinghui Temple was a barren mountain with uneven terrain and overgrown weeds. However, the families were extremely happy to hear that the land had been designated, and they immediately took action with the help of the farmers. Leveling the foundation, weaving grass mats, building the house frame, transporting materials, you helped me, I helped you, building one room, and then building the second room. By May of this year, sixty-seven rooms had been built, solving the housing problem for one hundred and thirty-six households.
    Xie Leqiong said: These houses are very cheap, costing only five or six yuan per room. Why are the rooms so cheap? Because the walls, roofs, and doors and windows of these houses are made of bamboo boards and grass mats, without any mud plastering at all. Families who live a mobile life for a long time do not feel that these simple houses are simple at all. The thatched houses have already been built from the mountain depression all the way to the top of the mountain. The roof of one household is connected to the foundation of the other, looking like a tall building from a distance. The villagers call this "building" the "Family Village."
  Vegetable Production Team in the Forest
    Sun Yuxia, a representative from the Jingpo Forestry Area in Heilongjiang, said: "Vegetables are too cheap in Beijing!"
    She said that it is too difficult to eat vegetables there. Vegetables are not grown in the forest, and they are all transported from other places. Leeks in winter sell for more than one yuan per pound; string beans in summer sell for four jiao per pound. Ordinary workers earn tens of yuan a month, and the whole family's livelihood depends on it. How can they afford to buy vegetables? All year round, they eat yellow soybeans mixed with salt. Some children, several years old, have never tasted green vegetables.
    "However, now everyone can eat vegetables," she said: Last year, seventy-four family members, under the leadership and support of the Party, administration, and trade union, formed a vegetable growing production team. The trade union advanced a portion of the funds to help solve the difficulty of production funds. Without rakes, the team members made eleven rakes themselves; without sickles and hoes, they borrowed them from the administration. Relying on the hands of women and old men, on the sunny slopes of the forest after logging near Jingpo Lake, in more than ten days, without affecting housework, study, and the work of the men, they reclaimed more than eleven hectares of wasteland. Without oxen to plow the furrows, they pulled the plow themselves; not knowing how to cultivate ridges, they figured it out together.
    Everyone's labor blossomed. The tomatoes, potatoes, autumn cabbage, and radishes planted last year were all harvested in abundance. In addition to ensuring the family members' year-round vegetable supply, they also sold 160,000 jin to the field and nearby logging yards, repaid the trade union's advance, purchased production tools such as sickles, hoes, and hoes, and left 700 yuan of public reserve, and each team member received an average of 79 yuan.
    The difficulty of eating vegetables was overcome, the living standards were improved, and the burden on the country was also reduced. Technician Shi Yunzhong, with a family of ten, had such difficult living conditions that even the family members did not have clothes to wear when they went out. The trade union subsidized him 20 yuan a month for a long time. However, after the family members participated in sideline production, they had vegetables to eat, no longer needed the trade union's subsidy, and also repaid more than 90 yuan of debt and made clothes.
  They Started a Kindergarten
    Wang Xiulan, director of the family committee of the Anshan Refractory Materials Factory, reported that their story of starting a kindergarten was very moving. She said that there are more than 3,000 employee families in Gongtong Street, Anshan. These households generally have children aged five or six. These children are really naughty, stepping on other people's chicks, getting oil under the cars, disturbing the sleep of night shift workers, asking their parents for money to buy snacks, and the families cannot even study culture. People say: "It would be good to start a kindergarten to manage them."
    Wang Xiulan said: To set up a kindergarten, you need a house. I ran all over the city and there was no way. Everyone said, let's rely on ourselves to build it! But what should we do if we don't even have a brick or a piece of wood? Without bricks, everyone took out the idle bricks from their homes, and some dismantled the bricks from the sheds for storing things. We also mobilized everyone to dig up the discarded old latrines and dry wells, collecting more than 5,000 pieces in three days. Without wood and cement, we mobilized the iron smelting plant, the civil engineering construction office, and the refractory materials factory to provide support.
    Wang Xiulan said: With the materials, construction started on June 10th of last year. During the construction process, family members and workers worked even harder. There were on-the-job workers, teenagers, old men and women in their fifties and sixties, and young women. Every Sunday, there were no idle people for guarding the night, boiling water, transporting materials, and pushing dirt. Everyone was very concerned about the kindergarten. One night, it rained heavily and I ran to see it. When I got there, three old men had already covered it. In this way, it was completed in only six Sundays.
    Wang Xiulan said: The house is built. However, there are no childcare staff yet. We found five young and lively women among the family members and sent them to the childcare training class organized by the Municipal Women's Federation for training. Without application furniture, we went to the Anshan Iron and Steel Welfare Office of the Refractory Factory to ask for kettles and tables. Without a watch, I took out my alarm clock. So, our kindergarten looked like a kindergarten.
    From August 1956 to now, a total of one hundred and fifty-four children have been admitted, divided into large, medium, and small classes. The kindergarten's expenses are collected according to the principle of not taking from those with difficulties and taking less from those with many children. Some take five jiao, eight jiao, and some take one or two yuan, which varies.
    The children no longer run wild and are polite; the neighbors are also harmonious; mothers are also able to participate in cultural studies and social activities; and the sleep of night shift workers is no longer affected by the children's noise.
    Economic Mutual Aid Groups Replaced
     "Rotating Credit Associations"
    People who are a little older know that in the old society, there was a popular "rotating credit association" – the practice of "inviting associations." Some people took the opportunity to exploit others; some people wanted to rely on "rotating credit associations" to solve difficulties in life, but their debts became more and more, and their lives became more and more difficult. Some people were even forced to commit suicide.
    Song Fuzhen told us that in the early days of liberation, this trend was still prevalent among the employees of the Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao. In 1953, the factory's first family committee, in coordination with the Party, administration, and trade union, educated the employees on communist morality and the importance of living frugally, abolished the "rotating credit association," and established economic mutual aid groups. Every month, everyone voluntarily contributed a little money and deposited it collectively in the bank. If anyone encountered any temporary difficulties, they could borrow it with everyone's consent. At the end of the year, it would be collected and used to buy New Year's goods.
    She told us that last year, their economic mutual aid group lent out a total of ninety-six times; the most was forty yuan, the least was four yuan, solving the difficulties of family members with children going to school, giving birth, getting married, getting sick, dying, and buying food. Worker Zhang Jixian's grandmother died in bed, and he did not have a penny. The factory accountant was not there; the mutual aid group immediately lent him 20 yuan to help him send his grandmother away; and promised that he would repay it in installments without affecting his family life. His whole family was very grateful. He said, "Your economic mutual aid group is so good. I will definitely use practical actions to improve production to thank you."
    In the past, family members of employees who were relatively wealthy were unwilling to participate. They said, "If I don't have money, I won't borrow it there; if I have money, I won't join." However, after they saw the mutual aid group helping employee families overcome difficulties time and time again, they also joined the mutual aid group. Now, their seventeen groups have organized economic mutual aid groups, with 345 households participating, accounting for 78% of the total number of households.
  Not Letting Children Waste Their Studies
    The story of the out-of-school children's tutoring class at the Nankou Railway Factory shows the wisdom and strength of the families. Yang Xiuyun, deputy director of the family committee of this factory, said that in the summer vacation of 1955, many children failed to pass the middle school entrance examination. The children were young and could not participate in labor, so they were naughty all day long. Some fought, some stole other people's crops, and picked other people's fruits. Parents were worried that their children would get worse and worse.
    Yang Xiuyun said that the family committee specifically discussed this issue. After thinking about it, everyone unanimously believed that setting up a tutoring class was a good way to manage the children. So everyone began to prepare. Without a classroom, the family committee found an empty room to borrow from the local school; without tables, the family members borrowed wooden boards temporarily stored by the school to make desks; without benches, the parents moved them from their own homes; without funding, each person paid 4 jiao per month as a teacher's allowance and miscellaneous expenses; without a teacher, they hired a student who had just graduated from junior high school. In this way, the tutoring class, including forty-seven children, officially started.
    After the school started, many new difficulties arose. The children, who had lived a carefree life for a while, could not settle down. The older children looked down on the young teacher and sometimes made the teacher cry. At this time, the family committee discussed a way to solve this problem. They encouraged the teacher's courage to teach; every day, four family committee members took turns to help the teacher manage the children. They cultivated student activists to take the lead in respecting teachers. They also invited the local Communist Youth League to give league lessons in the class and promptly recruited league members. They organized students to run street blackboards, publicize central work, send calligraphy to families to help them learn to read in bed; and organized students to go to the fields to eliminate "four pests." After this series of work, the enthusiasm of teachers and students was high. In this way, in less than a year, fifteen people were admitted to middle school, twenty-five people participated in work, three people went to the Northwest to reclaim wasteland, and the remaining people went back to their alma mater to study. The students' parents said with gratitude: "If it weren't for the help of the family committee, the children's studies would have been ruined!"

    自己的事情自己办
    本报记者　余药夫　张基福
    “家属新村”
    一天晚上，铁路第二工程段隧道十八中队家属宣传委员谢乐琼告诉我们一件新鲜事情。她说，1956年4月间，工程队完成了宝成路的工程以后，从陕西的白水江工地搬到宜宾县白花区工地。这个工地附近农户很少，没有房屋，工人和家属一起挤在临时工棚里，处处不方便。家属们想跟白水江工地一样，仍然搭起临时草房来。可是当地农民不愿卖给他们竹子和稻草。
    谢乐琼说：这可急坏人了。这怎么办呢？我们家属们没有灰心，也没有怨言。家属委员会跟工会和行政商量，要想盖草房必须争取农民兄弟支援。家属们组织了起来，白天帮助农民干活，晚上给农民演剧，开联欢会。农民们感动了。他们都愿意拿出自己的竹子、木料和稻草，愿意帮助家属盖草房。这时村干部又帮助家属们划出定慧寺作为造房基地。定慧寺是一座荒山，山上高低不平，乱草丛生，可是，家属们听到划定了地皮，高兴极了，大家在农民帮助下立即行动起来。平地基，夹草片，搭房架，运材料，你帮我，我帮你，盖了一间，接着又盖第二间。到今年5月为止，已盖起六十七间，解决了一百三十六户的住房问题。
    谢乐琼说：这些房子可便宜了，每间只花五、六元。为什么每间房这么便宜，因为这些房子的墙壁、房顶和门窗都是用竹板和草片编成的，根本没有抹泥巴。这种简陋的房屋长期过流动生活的家属们一点也不感到简陋。草房已经从山凹一直盖到山顶，这一户的房顶连着那一户的房基，从远处看去好像一座高高的楼房。老乡们都把这座“楼房”叫作“家属新村”了。
  森林里的蔬菜生产队
    从黑龙江镜泊林区来的代表孙玉霞说：“在北京，吃菜太便宜啦！”
    她说，在她们那儿，吃菜太艰难了。森林里不出菜，都从外地运来。冬天的韭菜，要卖块把钱一斤；夏天的豆角，也要卖四角一斤。一般职工，一个月拿几十块钱工资，全家的生活都靠它开支，哪有钱去买菜吃啊！一年到头，吃的就是盐拌黄豆。有的孩子，好几岁了，还没尝过青菜的味道呢。
    “不过，现在大伙都能吃上菜了”，她说：去年，他们七十四名家属，在党、行政、工会的领导、支持下，组成了种菜生产队。工会垫出了一部分款，帮助解决了生产资金的困难。没有耙子，队员自己动手做了十一把耙子；没有镰刀、镐头，就向行政借用。就凭着娘儿们、老头们一双手，在镜泊湖畔，在森林里伐木后的向阳的山坡上，十多天，在不影响家务、学习和男人工作的情况下，开出了十一垧多荒地。没有牛犋开垅，就自己拉着犁仗开；不会培垅，就互相琢磨着培。
    大伙的劳动开了花，去年种的西红柿、土豆、秋白菜、萝卜都丰收了。除了保证家属一年的吃菜外，还卖给本场及附近伐木场十六万斤，偿还了工会的垫款，购买了镰刀、镐头、锄头等生产工具，留了七百元公积金，平均每个队员还分得了七十九元钱。
    吃菜的困难克服了，生活改善了，也减轻了国家的负担。技术员石运忠，一家十口，生活困难得连家属出门穿的衣服都没有，工会长期每月补助二十元。但是，家属参加副业生产后，有菜吃了，不再要工会补助了，还还了九十多元债，制了衣服。
  他们办起了幼儿园
    鞍山耐火材料厂家属委员会主任王秀兰报告她们开办幼儿园的事情是非常动人的。她说，鞍山共同街的职工家属有三千多户。这些户一般都有五、六岁的孩子。这些孩子，真淘气，踩死别人的小鸡，到汽车底下挍油，扰乱夜班工人睡眠，向家长要钱买零食吃，家属想学文化也学不成。人们都说：“办个幼儿园，把他们管起来才好。”
    王秀兰说：成立幼儿园就要房子，我跑遍了全市都没有办法。大家说，依靠我们自己盖吧！可是我们连一块砖一块木板都没有怎么办呢？没有砖，大家把自己家里的闲砖拿出来，有的拆掉装东西的厦子砖。我们还动员大家挖了作废的旧便所和枯井，三天工夫搜集到五千多块。没有木料和水泥，我们动员炼铁厂、土建工程处和耐火材料厂来支援。
    王秀兰说：有了材料，在去年的6月10日就开工了。在建筑过程中，家属和工人干的更起劲，有在职的工人，有十几岁的儿童，有五六十岁的老大爷、老大娘，有青年妇女。每到星期天，打更的、烧水的、运料的、推土的，没有一个闲人。人人对幼儿园都很关心，有一天夜里下大雨我跑去看，等到那里的当儿，早有三位老大爷给盖好了。这样，只用了六个星期天就建成了。
    王秀兰说：房子盖起来了。但是，还没有保育人员，我们就在家属中找了五个年轻、性格活泼的妇女送到市妇联举办的保育训练班学习。没有应用家具，我们又去耐火厂鞍钢福利处要了水壶、桌子，没有表，我就把我的闹表拿出来。于是，我们的幼儿园就像个幼儿园了。
    1956年8月开始到现在，共收容了一百五十四名儿童，分成大、中、小三个班。幼儿园的经费，根据困难的不拿、孩子多的少拿的原则收，有拿五角、八角的，也有拿一元两元的，不等。
    孩子不再撒野了，有礼貌了；邻里也和睦了；妈妈们也便于参加文化学习和社会活动了；也不再因为孩子的吵闹，而影响夜班职工睡眠了。
    经济互助组代替了
     “标会”
    年岁稍大一些的人都知道，在旧社会里，流行着一种“标会”——“请会”的风气。有的人，借此剥削别人；有的人，本想靠“标会”来解决生活中的困难，但是，欠债反而愈来愈多，生活愈来愈困难，有的人甚至被逼得自杀。
    宋福祯告诉我们，解放初期，这种风气，在秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂的职工中还盛行。1953年，工厂的第一家属委员会，配合党、行政、工会，对职工进行了共产主义道德品质和精打细算过日子的教育，取消了“标会”，成立了经济互助组。每月，每人自愿凑一点钱，集体存入银行里，谁临时遇到什么困难，经过大家同意，就可以借给他。年终了，就成整的收回去，办点年货。
    她告诉我们，去年，他们的经济互助组，共借出了九十六次；最多的一次借出四十元，最少的一次借出四元，解决了家属孩子上学、生育、结婚、生病、丧亡和买食粮等困难。工人张继先，祖母死在床上，腰无半文，厂里会计又不在；互助组立即借给他二十块钱，帮助他将祖母发送出去了；并且，答应他在不影响家庭生活的情况下，分期归还。他一家人都非常感激，他说：“你们的经济互助组太好了。我一定用搞好生产的实际行动来答谢大家。”
    过去，生活比较富裕的职工家属不愿参加。他们说：“没钱，我不到那儿借；有钱，我也不入。”但是，他们看到互助组一次又一次地帮助职工家属克服困难的情况后，也纷纷参加到互助组里来了。现在，他们十七个小组都组织起了经济互助组，有三百四十五户参加，占总户数的78％。
  不让孩子们荒废学业
    南口铁路工厂失学儿童补习班的事，显示了家属的智慧和力量。这个厂的家属委员会副主任杨秀云说，1955年暑假有许多孩子没有考上中学。孩子们年纪小，不能参加劳动，整天淘气。有的打架，有的偷人家的庄稼，摘人家的水果。家长们都耽心自己的孩子越练越坏。
    杨秀云说，家属委员会专门讨论了这个问题，大家想来想去，一致认为成立一个补习班才是管好孩子的好办法。于是大家开始筹备起来。没有教室，家属委员会找到当地学校借了一间空房；没有桌子，家属们借了学校暂存的木板搭成书桌；没有凳子，家长们从自己家里搬来；没有经费，每人每月出四角钱作为教员的津贴和杂支费用；没有教师，他们聘请了一位刚从初中毕业的学生。这样，包括四十七个儿童的补习班就正式开课了。
    学校开课后又产生了许多新的困难。过了一段散漫生活的孩子们总是安不下心来，大点的孩子看不起年青的教师，有时把教员给气哭了。这时家属委员会又讨论了解决这个问题的办法。他们鼓励教师教书的勇气；每天有四个家属委员轮流值班帮助教师管理孩子。他们培养了学生积极分子带头尊敬师长。他们还请当地青年团到班上讲团课，及时吸收团员。他们组织学生办街道黑板报，宣传中心工作，给家属送字号帮助家属炕头识字；组织学生到地里去除“四害”。经过了这一系列的工作，师生的情绪都高涨起来。这样，不到一年工夫，就有十五名考入了中学，二十五名参加了工作，三名到西北垦荒，余下的又到母校去补习。学生的家长们都以感激的心情说：“要不是家属委员会帮助，孩子们的学业早就荒废啦！”
