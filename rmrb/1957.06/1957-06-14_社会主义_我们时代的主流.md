Socialism – The Mainstream of Our Time
Chen Youwei

　　The historical significance and far-reaching impact of great events are often not immediately apparent at the time they occur. When the guns of the Aurora battleship fired on the last bastion of Russian capitalism – the Winter Palace – on November 7, 1917, the diplomats in Paris and the stockbrokers in London could not believe that the fate of themselves and the systems they represented had been decided from that moment on. However, the historical development of the forty years since the October Socialist Revolution has shown who will win and who will withdraw from the stage of world history in the coexistence and competition of the two systems. The first half of the twentieth century, filled with many thrilling events, has many different characteristics of the times. The most important feature is that socialist ideology has gone beyond the scope of theory and become a reality of life, and the socialist system has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world system encompassing more than one-third of all mankind.

　　Socialism has liberated the broadest masses of working people, and the working people – workers, peasants, and intellectuals – are the producers of social material and spiritual wealth. The producers of wealth have become the owners of the wealth they produce. All exploiters and parasites have been thrown into the garbage bin of history. An infinitely broad road has appeared before the working people. They have become the masters of history. Labor has become a heroic undertaking, and the wisdom and talents of the people no longer serve a few people, but all the people. This is precisely where the superiority of socialism lies, and it is also where capitalism cannot hope to reach.

　　Feudalism and capitalism once took more than one or two centuries to prove their superiority to the previous social system, and at the same time establish their dominance in the world. And socialism has been able to prove its superiority to the capitalist system in less than forty years, and like the rising sun, it shows its infinitely vigorous vitality year after year.

　　In the Russia of the Romanov dynasty, the pendulum of time was almost still. But after the October Revolution, the socialist system threw the backward state of old Russia far behind. It has brought to the Soviet Union an industry that has grown thirty times compared to before the revolution, a universally prosperous culture and art, and true social and national equality. It has made coal miners and milkmaids, tractor drivers and elementary school teachers the real masters of the country. It has given farmers the opportunity to appreciate Shakespeare's plays and perform Tchaikovsky's music, and has enabled workers' children to enter institutions of higher learning and master the scientific keys to exploring the mysteries of nature. Today, the whole world is full of praise for the magnificent buildings of Moscow University and the large hydroelectric power station on the Angara River, for Ulanova's unparalleled artistic achievements and Tupolev's jet passenger planes. In the early 1930s, when building the dam on the Dnieper River, the Soviet Union had to hire American engineers to help, but today Washington is shocked that the Soviet Union trains nearly three times as many engineers each year as the United States. Even Allen Dulles exclaimed: "The most terrible Red Army is the Soviet army of scientists." In 1917, the Western bourgeoisie was debating whether the Bolsheviks in Petrograd could stand for a week or a month, but in 1957 they were worried about whether the Soviet Union's industrial output would exceed the level of the United States in the 1970s or earlier.

　　For the countries of Eastern Europe, the dividing line between the capitalist past and the socialist present is also very clear. The waters of the Danube and Vistula rivers flow forward day after day, but the countries located on their banks have been stagnant for a long time in the past long years. During the economic crisis of the 1930s, Poland's industrial production was reduced by half compared to 1913, and more than two million of Czechoslovakia's 3.5 million workers were completely unemployed and partially unemployed. Before the war, international monopoly capital firmly controlled the main wealth and economic lifeline of these countries like the tentacles of an octopus. The Rockefeller Consortium became the master of Romanian oil, and the capital of its "Romaine Oil Company" expanded to an astonishing 3,520 times in forty years. The torment of poverty, hunger, and scarcity forced generations of people to leave their homes and go to Western Europe and North America to make a living. The number of Polish immigrants averaged 137,000 per year between 1914 and 1938. The vast number of workers lived a nightmare-like life, while the monarchs, dignitaries, and exploiters were doing their best to squander their wealth. Before the war, the minimum wage of Hungarian workers could only take a train from Budapest to Vienna, which was not enough to make a living, but the largest landowner in the country, Count Esterhazy, imported piles of rubble from ancient Roman ruins from Italy to decorate his private garden.

　　Capitalism has a not-short history in Eastern European countries, but it can not only fail to solve the fundamental problems of economy and society, but even fail to solve the independence problems of these countries. Although Czechoslovakia had twenty-seven divisions of troops and heavy weapons produced by the Skoda armory in 1938, it could only be handed over to Hitler with its hands tied due to the weakness of the bourgeois regime and Chamberlain's betrayal. Similarly, when the armies of fascist Germany crossed the Polish border in September 1939, the bourgeois air force could only maintain two days of combat effectiveness, and the entire organized Polish National Defense Army was no longer existed after two weeks.

　　Socialism has opened a new chapter in the history of Eastern European countries. It has rapidly changed the face of these countries. Although the starting point and foundation of Eastern European countries that began construction after the war are not the same, their rapid economic development is the same. In just ten years, the industrial output of Eastern European countries has increased by two to ten times respectively. And in the era of bourgeois rule, this may have taken more than a century. Poland's industrial output has jumped from the 17th in Europe before the war to the 6th, Romania has its own tractors and oil drilling machines, Bulgaria is producing its own steel and cars, Czechoslovakia now has two radios for every nine people in the country, Albania has jumped from the sixteenth century to the twentieth century, and the whistle of trains can be heard in Tirana – all these things could only be dreams before the war. The social status of the people has completely changed. The old Polish Constitution of 1935, which stipulated that the president was only responsible for his behavior "before God and history," has become a wastepaper. Czechoslovakia's self-made jet fighters reliably defend the country's airspace, and Bulgaria's border guards are always ready to repel invaders. The people's ownership, unity, and the increase in national strength have given Eastern European countries today a wide range of voices in international affairs. Now, it is impossible to solve any major European problem satisfactorily if Berlin, Warsaw, and Prague are left aside.

　　The changes that have taken place in China are the main sign of the great leap forward of socialism in Asia after the war. After the emergence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Chinese people achieved victory in October 1949. The fact that 600 million people and nearly 10 million square kilometers turned from the rear of capitalism into a socialist outpost is painful and terrible for imperialism. No wonder Mr. Eisenhower made this assessment: "The free world has lost China, which is one of the biggest international disasters (?) of our time..." As time goes by, imperialism is becoming more and more uneasy. If Wall Street only regretted the loss of this vast human and material resources and military base in 1949, then their feeling was not only that later. The rapid progress and great achievements of China's socialist construction foreshadow a picture of fundamental changes in the balance of world political and economic forces.

　　More than 900 million people from the Elbe River to the Pacific coast are today united under the common banner of socialism. Although the countries that have only embarked on the road of socialism in the past decade still need a certain amount of time to overcome their economic backwardness – this backwardness is the legacy of the capitalist system, the entire socialist system has confidently issued a letter of challenge to the capitalist economy for peaceful competition. Although the absolute industrial production of socialist countries is not as good as that of major capitalist countries now. But from the past process, it is not difficult for people to see a hopeful future. In the twenty-six years from 1930 to 1955, the total industrial output value of the capitalist world increased by less than one time, while the Soviet Union increased to more than twenty times. During the post-war period, no Western European country's industrial development speed caught up with any country in Eastern Europe. Similarly, the speed of China's industrial growth is also unprecedented. It is precisely relying on this unparalleled speed that socialist countries have shortened the distance between them and the capitalist countries that have had more than a century of history in the shortest period of time, and will surpass them in the not-too-distant future. Jean-Maurice Hermann, President of the International Federation of Journalists, who recently visited China, wrote in the French "International Handbook" he edited: "When war between the two systems seems impossible, peaceful competition begins... When people see it (socialism) making lightning progress in a few decades from such a low base and despite the terrible losses of war, who can doubt that it will be able to achieve more rapid development in the coming years?" Mr. Hermann is not a Communist, so it is difficult to say that he is promoting communism. This is just a conclusion he has drawn after personally observing the real life of the world.

　　Socialism has fundamentally changed a quarter of the world's region. And the impact of this change has far exceeded its original scope.

　　Socialism is a powerful force for peace. The socialist system, which can develop its productive forces without limit, determines that it must strive for peace. Socialism does not need war, it needs peace. The socialist camp of 900 million people constitutes a powerful fortress of peace. This force for peace makes the eager-to-try imperialist war forces have to be cautious, and makes the colonialists have to regard their gunboat policy of aggression against small countries and undermining peace as outdated goods. The balance of power between peace and war has changed. Due to the favorable international environment brought about by the vigorous development of socialist forces, another great trend of the times – the nationalist trend of Asian and African countries – is rising. The era when imperialism can do whatever it wants is gone forever. More and more countries are breaking away from the shackles of imperialism and embarking on the road of independent development, forming a vast neutral area of peace. The famous American bourgeois political commentator Walter Lippmann wrote when talking about this: "The world situation has undergone tremendous changes. The most influential of the developments that have caused this change is that the Soviet Union has reached equal status in nuclear matters, the Soviet Union has forced (?) the success of industrialization... and the consolidation of the Chinese Communist regime. The combined impact of these developments has promoted neutralism...".

　　Socialism has gone through nearly forty years on its path of development, and forty years is enough to test the vitality of this system in all aspects. From Mr. Churchill, who tried to strangle the firstborn of socialism in its cradle, to the madman Hitler, who once climbed to the hinterland of the Soviet land, to Secretary of State Dulles, who is still obsessed with eliminating the red regime today, there are countless generals and soldiers who have played anti-socialist roles for decades. Capitalism has even tried more than once to prove its superiority to socialism by force, but whether it was 1919 or 1941, whether it was Korea in October 1950 or Budapest in October 1956, it was not socialism that failed in every round of the battle. And today, before the generals in the Pentagon plan how to eliminate Moscow, they must first consider the terrible consequences that Washington may suffer.

　　Socialism knows its past, present, and future. It has every reason to be proud of the epoch-making achievements it has made in the past forty years, and it has always been full of confidence in its inevitable victory. In Moscow, in Beijing, in Budapest, and in the world, socialism is advancing today. Anyone who cannot see this mainstream of our time and its inevitable trend of continued expansion and development is like a blind man who has seen nothing.

　　社会主义——我们时代的主流
　　陈有为
    伟大事件的历史意义和深远影响，往往并不是在它们发生的时刻就立即显现出来的。当1917年11月7日阿芙乐尔号舰上的大炮轰向俄国资本主义的最后一个堡垒——冬宫的时候，巴黎的外交家和伦敦的股票商们不会相信，他们和他们所代表的制度的命运，从此就被决定了。但是，十月社会主义革命以后四十年来的历史发展已经说明，在两个制度的共存和竞赛中，谁将赢得胜利，而谁又将退出世界历史的舞台。充满着许多惊心动魄事件的二十世纪上半叶，具有许多不同的时代特征。其中最主要的特征就是：社会主义思想越出了理论的范围而成为生活的现实，社会主义制度越出了一国的范围而成为一个包括全人类三分之一以上的世界体系。
    社会主义解放了最广大的劳动人民，而劳动人民——工人、农民、知识分子——是社会物质财富和精神财富的生产者。财富的生产者成了他们所生产的财富的所有者。一切剥削者和寄生虫，都被丢进了历史的垃圾箱。在劳动人民面前，出现了无限广阔的道路。他们成了历史的主人。劳动成了豪迈的事业，人民的聪明才智，不再为少数人服务，而是为全体人民服务了。这正是社会主义的优越性的所在，也是资本主义望尘莫及的地方。
    封建主义和资本主义曾经以一、二个世纪以上的时间来证明自己优于前一种社会制度，同时在世界范围内确立自己的统治地位。而社会主义不到四十年的时间就足以证明自己对于资本主义制度的优越性，并且像旭日东升那样一年比一年显著地表现出自己无限蓬勃的生命力。
    在罗曼诺夫王朝的俄国，时代的钟摆几乎是静止的。但是十月革命以后，社会主义制度把旧俄国的落后状况远远地抛向后去。它给苏联带来了比革命前增长三十倍的工业，普遍繁荣的文化艺术，真正的社会平等和民族平等。它使挖煤工人和挤奶妇、拖拉机手和小学教师成为国家的真正的主人。它使农民得到了欣赏莎士比亚名剧和演奏柴可夫斯基乐曲的可能，使工人的子弟进入高等学府，掌握探索自然奥秘的科学钥匙。今天全世界都在为莫斯科大学的宏伟建筑和安加拉河上的大水电站，为乌兰诺娃无与伦比的艺术成就和图波列夫的喷气式客机而赞口不绝。在三十年代初建筑第聂伯河上的水坝时，苏联还不得不延聘美国工程师来帮忙，但是今天华盛顿却因为苏联每年培养出比美国多近三倍的工程师而感到震惊。甚至艾伦·杜勒斯也发出了惊呼：“最可怕的红军是苏联的科学家大军。”1917年西方资产阶级在争论着彼得格勒的布尔什维克究竟能站得住一个星期还是一个月，而1957年他们却担忧着苏联的工业产量究竟在七十年代还是更早的时候就要超过美国的水平。
    对于东欧各国来说，区别资本主义过去和社会主义现在的分界线，也是十分明显的。多瑙河和维斯杜拉河的河水日复一日地向前奔流，但是位于它们两岸的各个国家，在过去那些漫长的岁月里却长期停滞不前。在三十年代的经济危机时期，波兰的工业生产比1913年减少了一半，捷克斯洛伐克全国三百五十万工人中，就有二百多万完全失业和部分失业。国际垄断资本在战前像章鱼的触须那样牢牢地控制着这些国家的主要财富和经济命脉。洛克菲勒财团成为罗马尼亚石油的主宰，它的
  “罗美石油公司”的资本膨胀达到了四十年内增加三千五百二十倍的惊人地步。贫困、饥饿和匮乏的折磨，迫使一代又一代的人们不能不离乡背井到西欧和北美去谋生。波兰的移民数目在1914到1938年间平均每年达到十三万七千人。广大劳动者过的是梦魇一般的生活，而那些君王、权贵和剥削者们却在竭尽挥霍之能事。战前匈牙利工人的最低工资只能坐一趟从布达佩斯到维也纳的火车，连勉强糊口都不够，但是全国最大的地主埃斯特尔哈齐伯爵，却为了点缀自己的私人花园而从意大利进口古罗马废墟的乱石堆。
    资本主义在东欧各国有不短的历史，但是它不但不能解决经济和社会的根本问题，甚至也不能解决这些国家的独立问题。捷克斯洛伐克在1938年时尽管拥有二十七个师的兵力和斯科达兵工厂所出产的重型武器，但是由于资产阶级政权的软弱和张伯伦的出卖，它只能被捆绑着双手白白地送给了希特勒。同样，当法西斯德国的军队在1939年9月越过波兰国境的时候，资产阶级的空军只能维持两天的战斗力，而整个有组织的波兰国防军过了两个星期也不复存在了。
    社会主义为东欧各国的历史揭开了新的篇章。它迅速地改变了这些国家的面貌。尽管东欧各国在战后开始建设的出发点和基础不尽相同，但是它们经济发展的迅速却是共同的。在短短的十年内，东欧各国的工业产量分别增加了二倍到十倍。而在资产阶级统治时代，这也许得经过一个多世纪。波兰的工业产量从战前的欧洲第十七位跃居为第六位，罗马尼亚有了自己的拖拉机和石油钻探机，保加利亚在出产着自己的钢铁和汽车，捷克斯洛伐克现在全国每九个人就有两架收音机，阿尔巴尼亚已从十六世纪跃进到二十世纪，在地拉那可以听到火车的汽笛声——所有这些事情在战前只能是梦想。人民的社会地位已经完全改变。规定总统只“在上帝和历史”面前对自己行为负责的1935年旧波兰宪法已成为废纸。捷克斯洛伐克自制的喷气战斗机可靠地保卫着祖国的领空，保加利亚的边防军随时准备着击退侵略者。人民的当家作主、团结一致和国力的增长，使东欧各国今天在国际事务中具有广泛的发言权。现在，欧洲的任何重大问题，如果要撇开柏林、华沙和布拉格，已经不可能获得圆满的解决了。
    在中国所发生的变化，是社会主义战后在亚洲巨大跃进的主要标志。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国出现以后，1949年10月中国人民取得了胜利。六亿人口和近一千万平方公里从资本主义的后方转为社会主义前哨的事实，对于帝国主义来说是痛心和可怕的。难怪艾森豪威尔先生要作出这样的估计：“自由世界失去了中国，这是我们这个时代最大的国际灾祸（？）之一……。”随着时间的推移，帝国主义是越来越不安了。如果说1949年华尔街还只是为丧失这一片庞大的人力物力资源和军事基地而惋惜的话，后来他们的感觉就不仅是这样了。中国社会主义建设的飞速进展和巨大成就预示着世界政治经济对比力量将要发生根本变化的一幅图景。
    从易北河到太平洋沿岸的九亿多人民，今天齐心协力地结合在社会主义的共同旗帜下。虽然那些在最近十年内才走上社会主义道路的国家，还需要一定的时间来克服自己经济落后的状况——这种落后正是资本主义制度的遗产，但是作为整个社会主义体系来说，已经满怀信心地向资本主义经济发出了和平竞赛的挑战书。虽然拿工业的绝对生产量来说，社会主义国家现在还抵不上主要的资本主义国家。但是从过去的进程中人们不难看到充满希望的未来。在从1930年到1955年的二十六年中，资本主义世界工业总产值只增加了不到一倍，而苏联却增加到二十倍以上。在战后期间，没有一个西欧国家的工业发展速度赶得上东欧的任何国家。同样，中国工业增长的速度，也是前所未有的。正是依靠着这种难以比拟的速度，社会主义国家才在最短的期间内缩短了它们和已经有了百年多历史的资本主义国家的距离，并且将在并不遥远的将来超过它们。最近曾来中国访问的国际新闻记者协会主席让·莫里斯·埃尔曼，在他主编的法国“国际手册”上写道：“在两个制度之间战争似乎已不可能的时候，和平竞赛就开始了。……当人们看到了它（社会主义）从那么低的基础上和尽管受到战争的可怕的损失都能在几十年内获得闪电般的进展之后，谁还会怀疑它将能够在未来的年代中获得更迅速的发展呢？”埃尔曼先生并不是共产党人，因此很难说他是在为共产主义作宣传。这只是他亲自观察了世界现实生活以后所得出的结论。
    社会主义使世界四分之一的地区发生了根本的变化。而这种变化的影响却远远地超出了它所原有的范围。
    社会主义是一支强大的和平力量。能够无限制地发展自己生产力的社会主义制度，决定了它必然要争取和平。社会主义不需要战争，它需要和平。九亿人口的社会主义阵营，构成了强大的和平堡垒。这个和平力量使得跃跃欲试的帝国主义战争力量不能不有所顾忌，使得殖民主义者不能不对于它们侵略弱小国、破坏和平的炮舰政策成了过时的货色。和平与战争的力量对比起了变化。由于社会主义力量蓬勃发展而产生的有利的国际环境，现在另一个伟大的时代潮流——亚非国家的民族主义潮流正在勃兴起来。帝国主义对它们为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。越来越多的国家摆脱帝国主义的羁绊而走上独立发展的道路，构成了广大的中立的和平地区。美国著名的资产阶级政论家华尔脱·李普曼在谈到这一点时写道：“世界局势已经产生了巨大的变化。引起这种变化的发展中最有影响的是，苏联在核子方面达到了平等的地位，苏联强迫（？）实行工业化获得成功……以及中国共产党政权的巩固。这些发展的联合影响已经促进了中立主义……”。
    社会主义在自己发展的道路上已经走过了将近四十年，四十年的时间是足以从各方面考验出这个制度的生命力的。从当年企图在摇篮里就把社会主义的头生儿扼杀的丘吉尔先生，到一度爬到苏维埃国土腹地的疯子希特勒，以至于今天仍在念念不忘于消灭红色政权的杜勒斯国务卿，几十年来扮演反社会主义角色的大将和小卒真是多得不可胜数。资本主义甚至不止一次地企图以武力来证明自己对于社会主义的优越性，但不论是1919年或1941年，不论在1950年10月的朝鲜或是1956年10月的布达佩斯，在交锋的每一个回合中失败的并不是社会主义。而今天，在五角大楼的将军们策划如何消灭莫斯科以前，他们首先就得好好地考虑考虑华盛顿可能遭到的可怕后果。
    社会主义知道自己的过去、现在和将来。它有一切理由来为自己四十年来所取得的划时代的成就而骄傲，它对自己必然胜利的前途从来就充满着信心。在莫斯科，在北京，在布达佩斯，在全世界，今天社会主义都在前进着。谁要是看不到我们时代的这个主流，和它继续扩大发展的必然趋势，谁就像瞎子一样什么也没有看见。
