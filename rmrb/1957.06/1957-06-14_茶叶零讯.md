Tea News Flashes

　　Yunnan Big Leaf Tea in Guangxi

　　This newspaper reports Guangxi Province has successfully introduced Yunnan Big Leaf tea seeds. The Yunnan Big Leaf tea variety is characterized by its thick leaves, long buds, and abundant trichomes. It is rich in internal substances and of high quality, making it one of the world's famous tea varieties. In 1955, the Lihan Agricultural Cooperative in Cenxi County, Guangxi Province, trialed five mu. Last autumn, members harvested a small amount for trial production and found that the Big Leaf tea tasted sweet and mellow, with a high aroma, much better than local tea. To expand the planting of this tea variety, the Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has transferred another 300 dan of Big Leaf tea seeds from Yunnan this year. Soon, Guangxi Province will produce high-quality Big Leaf tea. (Guo Zhen'an)

　　Fujian New Tea Shipped Domestically and Abroad

　　Famous Tea "Biluochun" Harvest

　　This newspaper reports "Biluochun", a high-grade famous tea with a long history that is sold far and wide at home and abroad, has achieved its largest harvest since liberation this year.

　　The origin of "Biluochun" is in Dongting Mountain, Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province. From the beginning of April to May 20, the three tea purchasing stations in Zhenze County have purchased 39,500 jin of first-grade "Biluochun", an increase of 39% over the same period last year. Among them, first-grade tea accounted for 6,022 jin, an increase of seventeen times compared to last year. With the bumper harvest of "Biluochun", the income of tea farmers has also generally increased by nearly 100% compared to last year. For example, the Heping Cooperative in Houshan Township had a tea income of more than 13,000 yuan last year, and this year it can earn 25,000 yuan.

　　Zhejiang Has a 200-Year-Old Contour Hedgerow Tea Garden

　　This newspaper reports the Jinjia Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongcai Township, Xinchang County, Zhejiang, recently discovered a contour hedgerow tea garden with a history of more than 200 years.

　　This tea garden has a slope of about ten degrees, a soil layer of more than five chi deep, and a measured area of one mu, five fen and six li. The plant spacing is 0.3 meters to 0.45 meters, divided into eight rows, each more than 50 meters long. The tea tree crowns are connected into strips, slightly curved along the horizontal line of the hillside.

　　The original owner of the tea garden, Sheng Hanjun, is a 64-year-old cooperative member. He recalled that this tea garden was planted by his great-grandfather, and it has been six generations until now. His grandson is also eight years old this year. Therefore, it is estimated that this tea garden was planted 200 years ago. According to Sheng Hanjun's experience, contour hedgerow tea gardens have three advantages: first, cultivation and management are convenient; second, tea tree roots and branches are closely connected, which can reduce soil erosion and maintain a deep soil layer, which is beneficial to tea tree growth; and third, tea trees in rows can increase the yield of leaves. Although the row spacing of this tea garden is relatively wide, the annual output of green leaves per mu reaches about 300 jin, equivalent to about 80 jin of dried tea, which is higher than the yield of ordinary tea trees.

　　The contour hedgerow technology of tea gardens was only promoted in Zhejiang Province after learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union after liberation. However, it was not expected that the working farmers of our country had adopted this technology more than 200 years ago. This shows that our country's production experience is extremely rich, and also proves that the currently promoted technology of contour hedgerow planting of tea trees is correct and feasible.

    云南大叶茶在广西
    本报讯　广西省引种的云南大叶茶种获得成功。云南大叶茶种，具有叶肉肥厚、茶芽长、茸毛多等特点，它所含内质丰富，品质很高，因而成为世界上的有名茶种之一。1955年，广西省的岑溪县里汉农业社，曾试种了五亩；去年秋季经社员采少量试制，认为大叶茶味道甘醇、香气高，比本地茶要好得多。为了扩大这一茶种的种植，广西省的农业厅在今年又从云南调进三百担大叶茶种。不久，广西省就要出产品质优良的大叶茶了。（郭镇安）
    福建新茶运销国内外
    本报讯　福建省各地茶厂加工的新茶，最近已开始大量运销国内外各地，供应市场需要。
    到5月下旬为止，福建省所产著名的闽东“白琳工夫”和“坦洋工夫”红茶，闽北的“白茶”，闽南的“乌龙茶”及福州窨制的各类“花茶”等，已有二万三千多箱出厂外调。最早上市的福州茶厂窨制的玳玳花茶、柚子花茶等已在5月中旬就陆续运往北京、天津、济南、沈阳、石家庄、呼和浩特等地。著名的闽北白茶，今年出口时间也比去年约提早半个月左右。

    名茶“碧螺春”丰收
    本报讯　远销国内外各地而有悠久历史的高级名茶“碧螺春”，今年获得了解放以来最大的一次丰收。
    “碧螺春”的产地在江苏省震泽县的洞庭山。震泽县三个茶叶收购站自4月初开秤到5月20日为止，已经收购到头茶“碧螺春”三万九千五百斤，比去年同期增加39％。其中一级茶有六千零二十二斤，比去年增加了十七倍。随着“碧螺春”的丰收，茶农们的收入也普遍比去年增加近一倍。如后山乡和平社，去年茶叶收入为一万三千多元，今年可收入两万五千元。

　　浙江有一块两百多年历史的等高条植茶园
    本报讯　浙江新昌县中采乡金家农业社，最近发现了一块有两百多年历史的等高条植茶园。
    这块茶园坡度在十度左右，土层深五尺以上，实测面积为一亩五分六厘，株距是零点三公尺到零点四五公尺，共分八行，长五十多公尺，茶树树冠已连接成条，顺着山坡的水平线而稍有弯曲。
    茶园的原主盛汉均，是一位年已六十四岁的老社员。他回忆说，这块茶园是他太公手里栽的，到现在已有六代，他的孙子今年也八岁了。因此，估计这块茶园是在二百年前栽下的。据盛汉均的体会，等高条植的茶园有三个好处：第一是耕作管理方便；第二是茶树根和枝条密接，可以减少水土冲刷，保持深厚的土层，对茶树生长有利；第三是茶树成行，产叶量可以提高。虽然这块茶园行距较宽，但每亩年产青叶达三百来斤，合干茶八十斤左右，比一般茶树产量为高。
    茶园的等高条植这一技术措施，是浙江省在解放后学习了苏联的先进经验后，才进行推广的。但没有想到我国的劳动农民在两百多年以前，就采用了这一技术。这说明了我国的生产经验是极其丰富的，也证明了目前推行的茶树等高条植这一技术措施，是正确可行的。　（胡坪　潘爱珍）
