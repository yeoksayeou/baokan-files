Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, reporter Li Feng reports: Some senior design personnel told reporters: China's design level has improved rapidly, and most construction projects in the Second Five-Year Plan can now be designed domestically.

The Era of Inability to Design Iron and Steel Complexes is Coming to an End

Ji Jinren, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, said that China can now design iron and steel complexes with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel. Chinese designers have designed eight large automated blast furnaces with a daily output of about 1,300 tons of pig iron each for Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel. Recently, they have also studied the design technology of blast furnaces with a volume of 1,386 cubic meters and a daily output of 2,000 tons of iron, which the Soviet Union helped China design. Ji Jinren said that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China can also independently design the world's first-class large blast furnace with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters and a daily output of 2,300 tons of iron. At the same time, China can also design large open-hearth furnaces that can refine 370 tons of steel per furnace, and is currently researching the design technology of large converters for pure oxygen steelmaking. Ji Jinren believes that in terms of rolling steel, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China will be able to design blooming mills with an annual rolling capacity of 3.5 million tons of steel ingots, large rolling mills like the Anshan Iron and Steel large rolling mill, and general steel plate plants. A few years ago, China could only design small blast furnaces of 100 cubic meters and small open-hearth furnaces of 15 to 30 tons; China had never designed an iron and steel complex on its own in its history.

Sun Zhuo, Zhang Fumin, and Li Decui, Deputy Chief Engineers of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, said that we have completed the design tasks for non-ferrous metal mines with an annual output of about 2 million tons, and are currently designing mines with an annual output of 4 million tons of ore. In terms of heavy non-ferrous metal smelting, we have designed factories with an annual output of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of copper, 30,000 tons of lead, 10,000 tons of zinc, or 30,000 tons of tin. We are currently designing a relatively large lead-zinc complex. In terms of light non-ferrous metal smelting, Chinese designers have designed factories with an annual output of 70,000 tons of aluminum and 3,000 tons of magnesium. Sun Zhuo and the other two Deputy Chief Engineers said that due to the accumulation of some experience and technical data in recent years, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China will be able to design mines with an annual output of 4.5 million to 6 million tons, factories with an annual output of 30,000 tons of tin, 50,000 tons of copper, and 100,000 tons of lead and zinc, as well as factories with an annual output of 50,000 to 100,000 tons of electrolytic aluminum.

From "Forced Into Service" to Independent Design

Chen Nailong, Chief Engineer of the Fifth Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building, first spoke to reporters about the lineup of the mechanical industry design team. He said that among the current designers, there are very few experienced engineers, and most are students who graduated from universities and colleges in the past few years. He said that when our designers started working in 1953, it really felt like being "forced into service." However, with the help of Soviet experts, our designers have been studying and working at the same time. In recent years, they have designed newly built and renovated various new-style machine tool factories, steam turbine factories, boiler factories, diesel engine factories, tractor factories, and automobile parts factories, as well as huge heavy machinery factories and locomotive and passenger car factories. Chen Nailong said that China can also design large and small shipyards for ocean and inland river transportation. Now, we are also designing instrument factories that China urgently needs. Chen Nailong said that Voronetsky, the leader of the Soviet Mechanical Design Expert Group of the State Construction Commission, once said that the design personnel in China's machinery industry "can already choose right and wrong and decide on the most correct method; they can already design independently." A bearing factory that China had intended to entrust to foreign countries for design was decided to be designed domestically under the suggestion and encouragement of this Soviet expert. Chen Nailong said that as long as we are good at learning, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we will also be able to design some larger and more precise mechanical manufacturing factories of various types.

Mao Henian, Chief Engineer of the Design Institute of the Thermal Power Generation Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, said that the design team for thermal power generation is quite strong. Now, it can prepare the design of fifty to sixty power stations a year; such a large design force can undertake the design tasks for all thermal power stations in the Second Five-Year Plan. Mao Henian said that at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, China could not design relatively large power stations. Now, we have designed the preliminary design of a 50,000-kilowatt medium-temperature and medium-pressure unit, and are designing a large power station with a 50,000-kilowatt high-temperature and high-pressure unit.

Zhang Changling, Chief Engineer of the Hydropower General Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, made a clear comparison between the past and present design levels of hydropower in China. He said that before liberation, except for a few larger hydropower stations built by Japan in Northeast China and Taiwan, under the rule of the Kuomintang, China only built a few pitifully small hydropower stations, with the largest capacity of no more than 3,000 kilowatts, and the total capacity of all power stations was only about 10,000 kilowatts. Now, the preliminary design of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station with a capacity of 580,000 kilowatts has been completed, and the technical design and construction drawings are being sent to the construction site one after another. The preliminary design of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station with a capacity of 960,000 kilowatts can be completed by the beginning of next year. Zhang Changling said that there are currently more than 20 hydropower stations being designed simultaneously. In the past few years, China has completed the design work of Guanting, Moshikou, Shizitan in Sichuan, Gutianxi in Fujian and other hydropower stations.

He Junying, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and Wang Xijue, Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Coal Industry, said that in terms of fuel industry, China can undertake the design of factories refining 1 million tons of natural oil and 1 million tons of synthetic oil; it can carry out general oil field development design and overall design. China can design mines with an annual output of less than 2 million tons and coal washing plants with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of coal.

According to materials from relevant departments, most projects in building materials, textile industry, light industry, and transportation can be designed independently by China.

An Important Guarantee for Frugal Construction and Accelerated Progress

The chief engineers, chief engineers, and other design personnel who received the reporter believed that since China's Second Five-Year Plan will focus on the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises and will use more general technical equipment, China can undertake the design of most construction projects. This will have a significant impact on implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality and accelerating the process of China's industrial construction.

The engineers said that the rapid improvement of China's design level is indeed the result of the hard work and learning of Chinese designers, but if there were no 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union as samples, and if there were no experts from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries coming to China for guidance, it would not have been possible to improve China's design level to the point where it can design most construction projects in the Second Five-Year Plan in just a few years.

The engineers said that China cannot independently design some enterprises that use the latest technologies, and still needs help from the Soviet Union and other countries; even for enterprises that China can design, some still need the guidance of experts from the Soviet Union and other countries and assistance in terms of technical data.

The engineers are waiting with great confidence for the state to determine the major projects that can be determined as early as possible in the Second Five-Year Plan and hand them over to them for design.

　　我国设计水平在苏联帮助下飞速提高
　　第二个五年计划绝大部分建设项目国内已能设计
    新华社13日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：一些高级设计人员对记者说：我国设计水平飞速提高，第二个五年计划绝大部分建设项目国内已能够设计。
    不能设计钢铁联合企业的历史即将结束
    冶金工业部黑色冶金设计总院副总工程师计晋仁说，我国已经可以设计年产一百五十万吨钢的钢铁联合企业。我国设计人员曾为鞍钢和本溪设计了八个日产一千三百吨左右生铁的大型自动化高炉，最近又学习了苏联帮助我国设计的容积一千三百八十六立方公尺日产二千吨铁的高炉设计技术。计晋仁说，在第二个五年计划期间，目前世界上第一流的容积一千五百一十三立方公尺日产二千三百吨铁的大高炉，我国也可以自行设计。同时，我国还能够设计每炉炼三百七十吨钢的大型平炉，目前正在研究纯氧炼钢的大型转炉的设计技术。计晋仁认为轧钢方面，在第二个五年计划期间，我国将能够设计每年轧三百五十万吨钢锭的初轧厂、像鞍钢大型轧钢厂那样的大型轧钢厂和一般的钢板厂。而几年以前我国还只能设计一百立方公尺的小高炉、十五到三十吨的小平炉；我国历史上自己从未设计过钢铁联合企业。
    有色冶金设计总院副总工程师孙倬、张富民和栗德萃说，我们已完成过年产二百万吨左右的有色金属矿山的设计任务，目前正在设计年产四百万吨矿石的矿山。在重有色金属冶炼方面，我们作过年产一万到两万吨铜、三万吨铅、一万吨锌或三万吨锡的工厂设计。目前正在设计一个比较大的铅锌联合工厂。轻有色金属冶炼方面，我国设计人员已作过年产七万吨铝和年产三千吨镁的工厂设计。孙倬等三位副总工程师说，由于近几年积累了一些经验和技术资料，第二个五年计划期间，我国将可以设计年产四百五十到六百万吨的矿山，年产三万吨锡五万吨铜和十万吨铅锌等工厂，以及年产五万到十万吨电解铝的工厂。
    从“赶鸭子上架”到独立设计
    第一机械工业部第五设计分局主任工程师陈乃隆首先对记者谈到了机械工业设计队伍的阵容。他说，现在的设计人员中，原来就有经验的工程师很少，大部分是前几年大专学校毕业的学生。他说，我们设计人员在1953年开始工作时，真有点“赶鸭子上架”的味道。可是在苏联专家的帮助下，我们设计人员一面学习，一面工作，最近几年已经设计了新建和改建的各种新式工具机厂、汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、柴油机厂、拖拉机厂和汽车附件厂，以及巨大的重型机器厂和机车客车厂。陈乃隆说，远洋和内河运输用的大小船舶制造厂，我国也能设计了。现在，我们还正在设计我国急需的仪表工厂。陈乃隆说，国家建设委员会苏联机械设计专家组组长沃洛涅茨基曾经说，我国机械工业方面的设计人员，“已经能选择是非，决定最正确的办法；他们已能独立设计了”。我国曾经打算委托国外设计的一个轴承厂，就是在这位苏联专家建议和鼓励下决定由国内进行设计。陈乃隆说，只要我们善于学习，在第二个五年计划期间，我们还将能够设计一些更大更精密的各种机械制造工厂。
    电力工业部火力发电总局设计院总工程师毛鹤年说，火力发电方面的设计队伍已经相当壮大，现在一年可以编制五六十个发电站的设计；这样大的设计力量，可以担负起第二个五年计划全部火力发电站的设计任务。毛鹤年说，第一个五年计划开始时，我国还不会设计比较大的发电站，现在我们设计了五万瓩中温中压机组的初步设计，并且正在设计五万瓩机组的高温高压的大电站。
    电力工业部水电总局总工程师张昌龄把我国水力发电设计水平的今昔作了鲜明的对比。他说，解放以前，除了日本在我国东北和台湾等地修建了几座较大的水电站以外，国民党统治下的中国，只建造了几个小得可怜的水电站，容量最大的不过三千瓩，全部电站总容量只有一万瓩左右。现在，容量为五十八万瓩的新安江水电站的初步设计业已完成，技术设计和施工图纸正陆续送到工地。容量九十六万瓩的刘家峡水电站的初步设计，明年年初可以完成。张昌龄说，目前同时进行设计的水电站共有二十多个。前几年我国已完成了官厅、模式口、四川狮子滩、福建古田溪等水电站的设计工作。
    石油工业部副总工程师何俊英和煤炭工业部主任工程师王锡爵说，燃料工业方面我国能够承担炼制一百万吨的天然油和一百万吨人造石油的工厂设计工作；可以作一般油田的开发设计和总体设计等工作。我国可以设计年产二百万吨以下的矿井和年产一百五十万吨煤的洗煤厂。
    据有关部门的材料，建筑材料和纺织工业、轻工业、交通运输等方面，大部分工程我国能够自行设计。
    勤俭建设和加速进度的重要保证
    接见记者的这些总工程师、主任工程师和其他设计人员们认为，由于我国第二个五年计划将以建设中小型企业为主，更多地采用一般的技术设备，因此，我国可以担负起绝大部分建设项目的设计。这样，对贯彻勤俭建国方针，加快我国工业建设的进程，将发生重大的作用。
    工程师们说，我国设计水平的飞速提高，固然是我国设计人员刻苦善学的结果，但是，如果不是有苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项工程作样本，如果不是苏联和其它社会主义国家来中国的专家的指导，在短短的几年中，要把我国的设计水平提高到今天能够设计第二个五年计划绝大部分建设项目的程度是不可能的。
    工程师们说，有些采用最新技术的企业，我国还不能独立设计，还需要苏联等国家帮助；即使我国能够设计的企业，有些也还必须有苏联等国家专家的指导和给以技术资料等方面的帮助。
    工程师们正在以极大的信心，等待着国家早日把第二个五年计划可以早日确定的重大项目确定下来，交给他们设计。
