Comprehensive report from our newspaper: A Xinhua News Agency report from Paris indicates that the French army's situation in Algeria is becoming increasingly difficult. In the Greater Kabylia region, the Algerian National Liberation Army has engaged in continuous fierce battles with French troops in recent days, tying down more than 4,000 French soldiers.

In Médéa, Bone and other places, the Algerian insurgents' guerrilla activities are very active. On the evening of the 4th, Algerian insurgents attacked a French military outpost in Dréan. In the Arab residential area of ​​the city, insurgents supported by local residents engaged in fierce street fighting with French soldiers.

As the French army is being beaten everywhere, French colonialists are intensifying their use of terrorist tactics to retaliate against unarmed Algerian civilians.

According to "France-Soir," General Massu's marine corps, commander of the Algerian military region, has reappeared on the streets of Algiers. Curfew times in many cities have also been moved earlier. The newspaper also revealed that in the Arab quarter of Algiers, a group of colonists attempted to occupy a prison holding Algerian patriots in order to commit violence against them.

Within France, on the morning of June 6, French authorities mobilized 1,000 police officers to conduct a major search of North African residential areas in and around Paris, arresting 126 people on charges of "participating in the Algerian rebellion." In the Seine, Seine-et-Oise, and Seine-et-Marne departments, police also searched for many North African residents suspected of participating in the "Algerian National Liberation Front."

On the other hand, French people are increasingly actively opposing France's colonial policy in Algeria. According to "L'Express," the French ruling group is uneasy due to the prolonged Algerian war. The newspaper stated that the idea that "negotiations should be held with the insurgents" is gaining increasing support.

According to a report from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali requested the United Nations on the 6th to investigate the massacre carried out by French troops in Melouza, Algeria, last week. In this massacre, 303 Muslims were killed.

Syrian newspapers on the 6th published a statement from the Algerian National Liberation Front condemning the French army's atrocities in the Melouza massacre.

    法军在阿尔及利亚到处挨打
    叙总理要求联合国调查法军暴行
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎报纸报道，法军在阿尔及利亚的处境日益困难。在大卡比利亚山区，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在过去几天中同法军连续展开激战，牵制了四千多名法军。
    在梅德阿、波尼等地，阿尔及利亚起义者的游击活动十分活跃。4日晚间，阿尔及利亚起义者袭击了德兰仙的法军岗哨。在城内阿拉伯居民区，受地方居民支持的起义者和法国士兵进行了剧烈的巷战。
    由于法军处处挨打，法国殖民主义者加紧采取恐怖手段，向手无寸铁的阿尔及利亚平民进行报复。
    据“法兰西晚报”报道，阿尔及利亚军区司令马休将军的陆战队又重新出现在阿尔及尔街头。许多城市的宵禁时间也提得更早了。报纸还透露，在阿尔及尔市的阿拉伯区里曾经有一群殖民者企图占领囚禁阿尔及利亚爱国者的监狱，以便对他们行凶。
    在法国国内，法国当局在6月6日黎明出动了一千名警察，对巴黎市区和市郊的北非籍居民区进行了大搜查，并且以“参与阿尔及利亚叛乱”的罪名逮捕了一百二十六人。在塞纳、塞纳—瓦斯和塞纳—马恩等省，警察也搜捕了许多有参加“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”嫌疑的北非居民。
    另一方面，法国社会人士越来越积极地反对法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策。据“新闻报”消息，由于阿尔及利亚战争拖延日久，法国统治集团惶惶不安。报纸说，认为应当“同起义者谈判”的主张已经越来越深入人心。
    另据大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利6日要求联合国调查法国军队上星期在阿尔及利亚迈卢兹的大屠杀。在这次大屠杀中，有三百零三个穆斯林被杀害。
    叙利亚报纸6日刊载了一项阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的声明，谴责法军在迈卢兹大屠杀的暴行。
