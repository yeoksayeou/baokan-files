　　法军在突进行新挑衅
　　突尼斯首相提出警告
    本报综合报道　据新华社14日讯：突尼斯政府6月13日向法国驻突尼斯大使馆就驻在突尼斯境内梅特拉威地区的法军举行炮兵演习的事提出抗议。
    突尼斯政府发表的公报说，梅特拉威的居民举行了抗议示威，反对法军这种“新的挑衅行动”。
    同一天，突尼斯首相布尔吉巴在发表广播演说时说，要是眼前的法国和突尼斯军队间的冲突继续下去，就有爆发战争的危险。
    在这之前，突尼斯政府曾经几次要求法国政府来共同解决两国军队间的武装冲突问题。
    布尔吉巴说，法国军队拒绝服从突尼斯政府的决议而继续在突尼斯土地上调动军队，已经导致严重的局势。突尼斯人民准备对付硬加在他们身上的新的军事行动。
    目前突尼斯境内有法国驻军约三万人。
    在前一天，突尼斯首相召见了法国大使，并交给他一件照会，抗议法军最近在突尼斯南部挑起武装冲突。照会说，法军的行动是受到法国驻突尼斯大使馆“怂恿的”。
