　　Since the end of World War II, Western countries have pursued a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, with military spending increasing year after year and the scale of war preparations growing ever larger, creating tension in the international situation. Therefore, stopping the arms race and rapidly reducing the armed forces of all countries has become the most urgent demand of the broadest masses of people in all countries of the world.

　　The Soviet Union has always opposed resolving international disputes by war and has always adhered to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. It was the first country to advocate large-scale disarmament and has always adhered to the position of large-scale disarmament. In the disarmament negotiations over the past decade, the Soviet Union has put forward many proposals aimed at promoting a disarmament agreement based on the attitudes of Western countries at various stages and the international situation at the time. Due to the lack of sincerity on the part of Western countries, disarmament negotiations have not reached an agreement. However, negotiations have not completely broken down after all, and the positions of the major powers still have the possibility of gradually converging, and the Soviet Union has played a positive role in this.

　　In the course of negotiations on the disarmament issue, the Soviet government has made efforts more than once to narrow the differences between the two sides and adopt their suggestions. But whenever the Soviet government did this, the Western countries retreated and abandoned the suggestions they had originally put forward.

　　For example, Western countries once firmly opposed all Soviet proposals on banning nuclear weapons. At the 1955 Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Western countries suggested solving the disarmament issue by starting with the reduction of conventional armaments, without linking this work to the issue of banning atomic weapons. They wanted to use this method to evade discussion on this issue. Although the Soviet government still insisted that an agreement should be reached quickly on banning nuclear weapons, in order to break the deadlock in the negotiations, it agreed to the plan put forward by Western countries in March 1956 at the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee to first resolve the issue of reducing the number of armed forces and conventional armaments. The Soviet Union believed that since Western countries were determined not to ban nuclear weapons, it would be beneficial to reach an agreement on the issue of reducing conventional armaments first. But when the Soviet Union accepted this plan insisted upon by Western countries, they immediately retreated. At this time, they said that the issue of reducing conventional armaments could not be discussed without resolving the issue of atomic weapons. They instead accused the Soviet Union of intentionally setting aside the issue of reducing atomic and nuclear armaments.

　　The situation was the same on the issue of reducing conventional armaments and armed forces. In its proposal on May 10, 1955, the Soviet Union also accepted the Western countries' proposal on the level of armed forces of the five major powers. At that time, Western countries argued that the Soviet Union had an advantage over the West in conventional armaments, and only after the Soviet Union greatly reduced its conventional armaments could the West agree to ban atomic weapons. In order to pretend to be serious, they put forward suggestions specifying the specific levels to which the armed forces of the five major powers should be reduced. But when the Soviet Union accepted this proposal, the Western countries immediately abandoned their own proposal; and put forward another proposal that included higher levels of armed forces. However, at the United Nations Disarmament Commission in July 1956, the Soviet Union once again agreed to the Western countries' proposal as the first step in disarmament. While the US representative said that the Soviet Union's agreement with the Western countries' second proposal on the level of armed forces of the major powers was good news, he created new problems, insisting that the Soviet Union's agreement could only be considered "serious" if the Soviet Union accepted the aerial inspection plan proposed by the United States. However, this so-called aerial inspection plan actually had nothing to do with disarmament; on the contrary, it would increase mutual suspicion. Even so, in order to promote a disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union, in its statement on disarmament and easing international tensions on November 17, 1956, expressed its willingness to consider this issue and believed that aerial inspection could be used as one of the means of supervising disarmament, to be implemented simultaneously in the European regions where the main armed forces of the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty member states were stationed. In the partial disarmament proposal on April 30 this year, the Soviet government took new steps to bring the positions of the two sides closer, stating that it agreed not only to limit the aerial inspection area to Europe but also to expand it to a vast area in the Far East, as long as the United States agreed to demarcate a considerable area of its own. At this time, the Western countries, especially the propaganda machine of the United States, hurriedly looked for various excuses to spread an atmosphere of suspicion.

　　When Western countries stubbornly refused to conclude an agreement on disarmament, the Soviet government made new major efforts last year to pave the way for disarmament. On May 14 last year, the Soviet Union suggested that all countries, especially the major powers with large armed forces, should unilaterally begin to reduce their armed forces and stop the arms race without waiting for an international disarmament agreement to be reached; and took the lead in this important issue, taking the lead in acting, massively reducing armed forces, withdrawing the only two military bases abroad, and reducing military budgets. This action has played a significant role in improving the international atmosphere and strengthening trust between countries. At the same time, the Soviet government also stated that if the United States, Britain, and France also correspondingly reduced their armed forces and armaments, then the Soviet Union would be prepared to study the issue of further reducing its own armed forces. However, these constructive practical actions of the Soviet Union have not been responded to by Western countries.

　　After the armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt and the failure of the international reactionary forces' conspiracy in Hungary, a new arms race movement was also launched in the North Atlantic Group. The United States' appropriations for expanding armaments have greatly increased compared with 1956. The draft budget for the 1957-1958 fiscal year stipulates that military appropriations will increase to 45.3 billion US dollars, accounting for 63% of the total national budget expenditure. The North Atlantic Group Council convened during this period passed a resolution to continue expanding armaments, and at the same time, the meeting emphasized equipping the member states' armies of this group with atomic weapons. The US aggressive group is trying its best to use this period of international turmoil to drag the international situation deeper into the "Cold War" and push the world to the brink of war.

　　At this tense moment, the Soviet Union issued a series of new calls for disarmament. On November 17, 1956, the Soviet government put forward a statement on disarmament and easing international tensions. Bulganin also sent letters to the government leaders of the United States, Britain, France, India, and China regarding this statement. World opinion generally believes that this is a major contribution to solving the disarmament issue. At the meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee in London on March 18 this year, the Soviet representative again put forward a comprehensive and specific proposal on the disarmament issue based on the above-mentioned statement. This proposal took into account the suggestions of Western countries, including the suggestions they recently put forward to the 11th session of the UN General Assembly. Therefore, it is a new step to promote the convergence of the positions of the major powers. After this proposal was not accepted by the West, the Soviet representative put forward a new proposal on partial disarmament measures on April 30. In order to achieve the goal of partial disarmament, the Soviet Union took new steps on the issue of international supervision to move closer to the Western countries' proposals. This step particularly considered the US's insistence on conducting aerial inspections. In view of the urgency and relative ease of stopping nuclear weapons tests, the Soviet Union also advocated immediately signing an agreement to stop nuclear weapons tests within a certain period, in order to meet the expectations of the people of the world and make the first step in the disarmament issue.

　　The conciliatory attitude adopted by the Soviet Union in the disarmament negotiations must not be understood as the Soviet Union's weakness. The Soviet Union's national strength is now stronger than at any time in history. Today, the Soviet Union is not only able to best defend itself, but also to defend the international cause of peace. The Soviet Union's spirit of conciliation in the disarmament negotiations is only because it is a socialist country, and its foreign policy has always been guided by the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems.

　　In the face of the Soviet Union's recent series of efforts on disarmament, Western countries are once again facing a test. The people of the whole world are watching the United States, watching the new attitude of US representative Stassen after returning to London from Washington.

　　苏联在裁军问题上的巨大努力
　　任学文
    第二次世界大战结束以后，西方国家执行扩军备战的政策，军费连年增加，战争准备的规模越来越大，造成了国际局势的紧张。因此，停止军备竞赛，迅速裁减各国的武装力量，成为世界各国最广大群众的最迫切的要求。
    苏联过去和现在始终反对以战争方式解决国际争端，始终遵循列宁主义的关于不同制度的国家和平共处的原则。它是最早主张大规模裁军的国家，并且始终坚持大规模裁军的立场。在战后十余年的裁军谈判中，苏联曾经根据各个阶段西方国家的态度和当时的国际情况，提出过许多旨在促成裁军协议的建议。由于西方国家缺乏诚意，裁军谈判一直没有达成协议。但是谈判毕竟没有决裂，并且大国之间的立场还有逐渐接近的可能，苏联在这中间起了积极的作用。
    苏联政府在关于裁军问题的谈判过程中，曾经不止一次地努力缩小双方的分歧，采纳它们的建议。但是每逢苏联政府这样作的时候，西方国家就向后倒退，把它们自己原先提出过的建议都抛弃了。
    例如：西方国家曾经坚决反对苏联提出的关于禁止核武器的一切建议。在1955年日内瓦四国外长会议上，西方国家曾经建议从裁减常规军备开始来解决裁军问题，而不把这个工作同禁止原子武器问题联系起来。它们想用这样的办法来规避关于这个问题的讨论。苏联政府虽然仍坚持应当迅速就禁止核武器达成协议，但为了打破谈判的僵局，在1956年3月联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上同意了西方国家提出的首先解决裁减武装部队人数和常规军备的问题的计划。苏联认为：既然西方国家坚决不同意禁止核武器，那么先就裁减常规军备问题达成协议也是有好处的。可是当苏联一接受西方国家坚持的这个计划的时候，它们就立即后退了。这时候它们又说：不能在没有解决原子武器问题的情况下来讨论裁减常规军备问题。它们反而指责苏联有意把裁减原子核军备的问题撇在一边。
    在常规军备和武装部队的裁减问题上，情形也是一样。苏联在1955年5月10日的建议中也曾经接受了西方国家关于五大国武装部队水平的建议。当时西方国家争辩说，苏联在常规军备上比西方占优势，只有在苏联大大裁减常规军备之后，西方才能同意禁止原子武器。为了装得煞有介事，它们提出了规定五大国武装部队应该裁减到的具体水平的建议。但是当苏联接受这个建议的时候，西方国家又马上放弃了自己提出的建议；而且提出了另一个包括了比较高的武装力量水平的建议。然而苏联在1956年7月的联合国裁军委员会上，再一次同意西方的主张作为裁军的第一个步骤。美国代表一方面说苏联同意西方国家第二次提出的大国武装部队水平是一个好消息，但是他又节外生枝，硬说只有苏联接受了美国提出的空中视察计划的时候，苏联的同意才能被认为是“认真的”。然而这个所谓空中视察计划，实际上跟裁军并无关系，相反会增加相互的猜疑。即使如此，苏联为了促成裁军协议，在1956年11月17日关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的声明中，还是表示愿意考虑这一问题，并且认为可以把空中视察作为裁军的监督办法之一，在北大西洋集团和华沙条约成员国主要武装力量所驻扎的欧洲地区同时实行。在今年4月30日的局部裁军建议中，苏联政府更采取了新的步骤来使双方的主张接近起来，表示同意不仅把空中视察地区限制在欧洲而且可以扩大到远东的一个广大地区，只要美国同意划出自己相当的一块地区来。这时候，西方国家特别是美国的宣传机器又急忙寻找各种借口来散布怀疑的气氛。
    当西方国家顽固地不愿意就裁军问题缔结协定时，苏联政府在去年曾经作出了新的重大努力来为裁军铺平道路。去年5月14日，苏联建议各国，首先是那些拥有庞大武装力量的大国，不必等待达成国际裁军协定就单方面地着手缩减武装力量和停止军备竞赛；并且第一个在这个重要问题上以身作则，率先行动，大量裁减了武装部队，撤消国外仅有的两处军事基地，并削减了军事预算。这种行动，对改善国际气氛和加强国与国之间的信任，有很大的作用。同时苏联政府还声明如果美、英、法三国也相应地裁减武装力量和军备，那么苏联准备研究进一步缩减自己武装力量的问题。但是苏联的这些建设性的实际行动并没有得到西方国家的响应。
    在英、法、以色列对埃及的武装侵略和国际反动势力在匈牙利的阴谋失败之后，在北大西洋集团中还掀起了新的备战运动。美国的扩充军备的拨款比1956年大大增加了，1957年—1958年财政年度的预算草案规定，军事拨款增加到四百五十三亿美元，占国家预算全部开支的63％。在这一期间召开的北大西洋集团理事会上通过了继续扩充军备的决议，同时会议强调以原子武器装备这个集团的成员国的军队。美国侵略集团极力利用这一时期的国际动乱，企图把国际局势更深地拖到“冷战”中去，把世界推到战争的边缘。
    在这个紧张时刻，苏联发出了一连串新的主张裁军的呼声。1956年11月17日，苏联政府提出了关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的声明，布尔加宁并就这一声明致函美、英、法、印和中国的政府领导人，世界舆论普遍认为这是对解决裁军问题的一个重大贡献。在今年3月18日伦敦联合国裁军小组委员会会议上，苏联代表又根据上述声明提出了一项全面而具体的关于裁军问题的建议，这项建议考虑了西方国家的建议，包括它们最近向联大十一届会议提出的建议，因此它是促使大国立场接近的一个新步骤。当这个建议又没有被西方接受以后，苏联代表在4月30日又提出了一项关于局部裁军措施的新建议。为了达到局部裁军的目的，苏联在国际监督问题上采取了新的步骤来向西方的主张靠拢，这个步骤特别考虑了美国坚持的进行空中视察的态度。鉴于停止核武器试验的迫切性和比较简易可行，苏联还主张立即签订在一定期限内停止核武器试验的协议，以符合世界人民的期望，并使裁军问题跨出第一步。
    苏联在裁军谈判中所采取的和解态度，决不能理解为苏联的软弱，苏联的国力现在比历史上任何时期都更为强大，今天苏联不仅能够最好地保卫自己，也能保卫国际和平事业。苏联在裁军谈判中的和解精神，只是因为它是社会主义国家，它的外交政策从来是以不同制度国家和平共处的原则为指针。
    在苏联最近的一系列关于裁军的努力前面，西方国家再一次面临着考验。全世界人民都在注视着美国，注视着美国代表史塔生从华盛顿回到伦敦以后的新态度。
