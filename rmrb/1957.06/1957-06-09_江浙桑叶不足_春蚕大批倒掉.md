Xinhua News Agency report: In Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, the main silkworm cocoon producing areas of the country, more than 79,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs had to be discarded due to a lack of mulberry leaves. Among these, 59,000 sheets of spring silkworms were discarded in Zhejiang Province. Preliminary estimates indicate that the spring cocoon production in the two provinces will decrease by more than 50,000 dan this year.

The number of spring silkworms actually raised by farmers in both provinces this year is less than last year. The silkworm seeds issued to farmers in Zhejiang Province this year were more than 15,000 sheets less than the actual number raised in the province last year. Furthermore, the number of silkworms discarded this year accounts for 7.5% of the silkworm eggs issued, the majority of which were discarded in the famous silkworm cocoon producing area of Jiaxing Prefecture. Because the number of silkworms discarded in both provinces is relatively large, it has seriously affected the completion of this year's spring cocoon production plan.

The main reasons for the discarding of silkworms are that the mulberry trees in these silkworm producing areas are old, there are many missing trees, renewal work has not been done well, the amount of fertilizer applied to the mulberry gardens is very small, and in some places other crops are interplanted in the mulberry gardens. In addition, the system of contracted responsibility for mulberry gardens has not been established, or the work points recorded in the contracting work are unreasonable.

Silk is one of China's important export commodities. In 1956, the country's silkworm cocoon production only reached 1.47 million dan, which, although an increase of 138% compared to 1949, was only 33.45% of that in 1931 before the Anti-Japanese War. The agricultural departments believe that the reduction in spring cocoon production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this time is a serious lesson in production, because the harvest from interplanting other crops in mulberry gardens cannot compensate for the loss of spring cocoon production. To restore and develop the sericulture industry, it is necessary to strengthen the management of existing mulberry gardens, increase the yield per unit area, and change the downward trend of sericulture production in the old areas. Renewal and replanting work must be effectively carried out in the old mulberry gardens, and new mulberry gardens should be developed in a planned way.

### 江浙桑叶不足  春蚕大批倒掉

    江浙桑叶不足  春蚕大批倒掉
    据新华社讯　全国主要蚕茧产区浙江和江苏两省今年有七万九千多张种的春蚕因缺乏桑叶而被迫倒掉。其中五万九千张种的春蚕是浙江省倒掉的。初步估计今年两省春茧将减产五万多担。
    两省农民今年实养的春蚕都比去年少。浙江省今年发给农民的蚕种比去年全省实际养的蚕种要少一万五千多张，今年全省倒掉的蚕数又占实发蚕种张数的7.5％，其中绝大部分是出产蚕茧著名的嘉兴专区倒掉的。由于两省倒蚕数字都比较大，因此严重影响了今年春茧生产计划的完成。
    发生倒蚕的主要原因是，这些蚕产区桑树老，缺株多，更新工作没有做好，桑园的施肥量很少，有些地方又在桑园里间作了其他作物，加上对桑园包产责任制没有建立起来，或者在包产工作中工分记得不合理。
    蚕丝是我国重要的出口物资之一。1956年，全国蚕茧产量才达到一百四十七万担，这虽比1949年增加了138％，但是和抗日战争以前比较，仅为1931年的33.45％。农业部门认为：这次江浙两省春茧减产是生产上的严重教训，因为桑园间种其他作物的收获，远不能抵偿春茧减产的损失。要恢复和发展蚕桑事业，必须加强对现有桑园的管理工作，提高单位面积产量，改变老区蚕桑产量的下降趋势。对老桑园要切实做好更新补苗工作，并有计划的开拓新桑园。
