    Beijing, June 8th. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society yesterday invited the Central Committee members of the Jiusan Society in Beijing, heads of various departments and committees, and members of the Beijing Branch Committee of the Jiusan Society to hold a symposium to discuss the relationship between the Party and democratic parties, the relationship between the Party and non-Party intellectuals, and how democratic parties can play a role in the new situation, etc., in order to help the Party with its rectification campaign.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Tu Changwang, Secretary-General of the Jiusan Society, called on everyone to speak freely and help the Party with its rectification campaign. Xu Deheng said: We members of the democratic parties must distinguish between right and wrong, and we must distinguish between major right and wrong, so that we will not lose our way.
    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, spoke first. He believed that since the Communist Party began its rectification campaign, the democratic parties have put forward many opinions. Generally speaking, these opinions are good. Everyone has spoken out what they were hiding in their hearts and unwilling to say in the past, which has a great effect on helping the Party with its rectification campaign and promoting democracy in the future. However, there are problems among the good ones. The vast majority are good, and a very few have one-sided or even wrong views. For example, some people, in the midst of great blooming and contending, are somewhat negating the leadership of the Party and negating the people's democratic dictatorship, and seem to be still hesitating about the socialist direction. I think this is wrong. Even in the midst of great blooming and contending, some people are writing anonymous letters to intimidate those who put forward opinions they disagree with. For example, Lu Yuwen received such a letter, which I think is extremely bad.
    Next, Xu Deheng talked about his views on the rectification campaign. He said: The purpose of helping the Party with its rectification campaign is to consolidate and strengthen the Party's leadership in order to better build socialism. I am afraid that we comrades of the Jiusan Society all feel the same way: without the leadership of the Party, our future would be unimaginable. To help the Party with its rectification campaign, to only talk about the bad and not the good, to not talk about the good is not equal to negating the good. Some people kick the good away, which makes it impossible to distinguish between right and wrong. We members of the democratic parties must distinguish between right and wrong, and we must distinguish between major right and wrong, so that we will not lose our way. Those of you here who are over thirty years old can think about the past, compare it with the present, and see that the imperialists who were riding on our heads have been driven away, and the traitorous warlord regime has been destroyed. The miracles are indescribable. Who led this result? It was the Communist Party. Don't obliterate this major right and wrong. Some people say: even without the Communist Party leadership, they would not betray the country. I say, for an ordinary person to sell out the country is not so easy. If we don't want the Communist Party leadership, do we want Chiang Kai-shek to come? If he comes, he will sell out the country. The Liu Ziran incident in Taiwan will appear on the mainland. At the same time, we want to take the socialist road, and Chiang Kai-shek is against taking the socialist road. If he comes, I will not agree, and the comrades of the Jiusan Society will not agree. Therefore, in the process of making suggestions, do not lose your political direction. He believes that the comrades of the Jiusan Society will not lose their political direction.
    Xu Deheng also talked about the issue of "walls" and "ditches" between the Party and non-Party members. He said: In some places, the walls are built very strong, and the ditches are dug very deep, so demolishing the walls and filling the ditches is one of the purposes of this rectification campaign. Since liberation, several major campaigns have been carried out continuously. These campaigns are basically good. Without them, we could not have today, but there are also side effects. Are these side effects one of the reasons for the formation of "walls and ditches"? From the perspective of the Jiusan Society, to demolish the walls and fill the ditches is to further improve the unity between the Party and non-Party members and truly achieve unity—criticism—unity. Therefore, we must speak out well what we have heard, thought, and seen, and engage in great blooming and contending. We have not yet achieved this. For example, Nanjing Normal College transferred an assistant dean, and after sitting with him in the office for a long time, the non-Party dean of the Normal College still does not know what he does. I want him to talk about such things, but he is unwilling to talk about it himself. Even if I want to talk about it for him, he does not agree. So I say that "walls and ditches" are two-sided and must be demolished from both sides. There are also cases where speaking out is ineffective. For example, Zhang Zexi, who taught at Tsinghua University for more than 20 years, was transferred to Tangshan Institute of Technology in 1952. When evaluating his rank, he rated his former students as level two, but he was rated as level three. He told me about it, and I made a suggestion, but it was not resolved. Why was he rated as level three? It is said that because he did not grow up in Tangshan Institute of Technology, this is sectarianism! At this time, someone interjected: Not entirely so. The Ministry of Higher Education once said that as long as Tangshan Institute of Technology proposed level two, they could approve it, but Tangshan Institute of Technology proposed it several times, but it was never approved. Xu Deheng said: This is bureaucracy! Among the three evils, two are present. It is either bureaucracy or sectarianism. Finally, Xu Deheng called on everyone that in order to help the Party with its rectification campaign, we comrades of the Jiusan Society should not have any worries and should speak out everything.
    Yang Zhaoxuan suggested that for some major issues, the Jiusan Society could submit opinions to the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the name of the organization.
    Yang Zhaoxuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, suggested in his speech that for some major issues, the Jiusan Society could submit opinions to the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the name of the organization. For example, the personnel system issue is generally considered to be a big problem. In many units, the personnel departments are all Party and League members. There is no problem that the personnel system should be controlled by the Party, but some very capable and fair non-Party people can also participate in some positions. For example, the Academy of Sciences is full of big intellectuals, so how can some young people control it? The Jiusan Society should submit this issue to the Party as an organization, and it is worth serious consideration. Otherwise, even if the rectification campaign is carried out, there is still no way to eliminate bureaucracy.
    Sun Chengpei believes that erroneous and harmful remarks must be pointed out in order to distinguish between right and wrong. If they are allowed to be mixed in, it will be extremely harmful to the normal progress of the rectification campaign.
    Sun Chengpei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, believes that there should be no rigid rules and regulations in great blooming and contending. He said that in great blooming and contending, there will inevitably be one-sided and even wrong opinions. Communist Party members inevitably make mistakes, and non-Party members also inevitably make mistakes. We advocate seeking truth from facts, but we should not be demanding or restrictive. However, he believes that erroneous and harmful remarks must also be pointed out in order to distinguish between right and wrong. If they are allowed to be mixed in, it will be extremely harmful to the normal progress of the rectification campaign and the cause of socialism.
    Chen Xingui's argument that the proletarian dictatorship is the root of all contradictions is a serious mistake and a reversal of black and white.
    Next, he criticized Chen Xingui's speech at the Central Small Group Meeting of the Democratic League. He believed that Chen's argument that the proletarian dictatorship is the root of all contradictions is a serious mistake and a reversal of black and white. He said that our people's democratic dictatorship, which is also the proletarian dictatorship, has resolved the contradiction between imperialist rule and the Chinese people, the contradiction between landlords and peasants, and the contradiction between capitalism and socialism. The working class and the bourgeoisie are antagonistic classes, but the CCP did not intensify them into antagonistic contradictions, but used peaceful transformation methods to transform them into non-antagonistic contradictions and gradually resolve them. Is this creating contradictions or resolving contradictions? The Communist Party is also leading us to build a strong socialist industrial country and solve the contradiction between humanity and nature. It is true that there are still contradictions among our people, and the reasons for these contradictions are very complicated. Some are contradictions between productive forces and relations of production, which are reflected as contradictions within the people. Some are caused by the mistakes of the three major styles made by some Communist Party organizations and members. Some are due to the fact that the construction of socialism has just begun, and there is insufficient experience and practice. Therefore, we cannot fully grasp the laws of socialist construction.
    He also criticized Chen Xingui's argument that the proletarian dictatorship is the root of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. He believed that this is also a reversal of right and wrong and a slander.
    Chu Anping's statement that "the Party's world" is the ultimate source of all sectarianism is a harmful confusion of right and wrong.
    He also criticized Chu Anping's opinion that "the Party's world" is the ultimate source of all sectarianism. He said: Everyone remembers that before liberation, the Kuomintang was a typical "Party's world." At that time, there were no parties outside the Party, and there were factions within the Party. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, it was the opposite: there were parties outside the Party, and there were no factions within the Party. Taking our society as an example, it was illegal before liberation, and it is legal after liberation. Now the number of members has increased to sixty times that before liberation. Isn't this the result of the CCP's help? The CCP also proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Since liberation, our society has participated in the management of state affairs. Taking the draft constitution as an example, we have repeatedly discussed it and put forward many opinions. In government agencies, our society has ministers, directors of departments and bureaus, and more presidents of colleges and universities and directors of research institutes. Most of the members of our society are heads, which was absolutely impossible before liberation. Some of them have positions and power, and some have positions but no power or little power. But in most cases, the situation is gradually improving. It can be said that the overall situation is increasingly widely and effectively participating in state affairs. How can this be said to be "the Party's world" or "uniformity"?
    Li Zuyin criticized Chu Anping's speech as "groundless talk" and "subjective views"; Yang Yuqing's speech was extremely incorrect.
    Li Zuyin's speech first affirmed that our country must have the leadership of the Communist Party. He said that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. This is undoubtedly true. But does the Communist Party have shortcomings? Does it have "three evils"? He affirmed that it does, otherwise there would be no need for a rectification campaign.
    Next, he criticized the sectarianism of some of our Party organizations and Communist Party members. He said that I had been attacked for criticizing the Communist Party before, and maybe some people thought that I would be negative about criticism. I am not negative at all. Whether at the symposium held by the State Council or at the symposium of the Legislative Affairs Commission, I still want to offer criticism because I want to be responsible to the Party. I have been working since 1949, and I have encountered many things that can illustrate the sectarianism of some Communist Party members. I will only give one example. In 1951, I worked in the Legislative Affairs Commission. Once, a symposium was held by Soviet civil law experts from Renmin University. Because I was the chairman of the Civil Affairs Regulations Committee, I was invited to participate. At the meeting, the Soviet experts asked me to talk about the drafting of China's civil law and marriage law. I made a 40-minute speech. The Soviet experts thought I spoke very well and had a basis, and I was really flattered. Li Guangcan, a member of the Legislative Affairs Commission and secretary of the Party branch, also participated in the symposium. Unexpectedly, as soon as Li Guangcan returned, he criticized my speech at the symposium as "boasting." He believed that this sectarian sentiment still exists in the Legislative Affairs Commission.
    Secondly, he talked about the issue of criticizing wrong opinions. He believed that some of the recent discussions at various symposiums were wrong. He said that these wrong opinions can be criticized because since it is called contention, there must be criticism. He also said that many people always say in their speeches that what I said may not be correct, please criticize me, but when everyone really wants to criticize, they disagree.
    Finally, he made sharp criticisms of Chu Anping's speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the CPC and Yang Yuqing's speech at the symposium of the State Council. He believed that Chu Anping's speech was extremely wrong. He said that Chu Anping would not fail to understand the law, let alone the constitution. According to the provisions of the constitution, the highest organ of power in our country is the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, not the State Council. And in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, there are twenty democratic figures serving as vice-chairmen. Why doesn't Chu Anping see the important and look at the secondary? Why is he so concerned about whether there are democratic figures among the vice-premiers of the State Council? And in the various ministries under the State Council, nearly a quarter of the ministers are democratic figures, and Xu Deheng, chairman of our Jiusan Society, is the Minister of Aquatic Products. Therefore, I think Chu Anping's speech is groundless talk and a subjective view, which does not proceed from reality and has no material basis.
    Regarding Yang Yuqing's speech, he said that I heard it with my own ears, and I think it is extremely incorrect. He said that Yang Yuqing's main point is to ask the Communist Party to step down, and even said "you all step down." I don't know who this "you" refers to. The most absurd thing is that he said that the Communist Party's violation of laws and disciplines started from Beijing, and the central government is the most chaotic. Why does Yang Yuqing have this understanding? His basis is this: his father was a landlord, and during the land reform, he ran to Beijing. The local peasants sent representatives to Beijing to bring his father back through the public security system. I think even if a Communist Party member has such a father, he will be brought back, but Yang Yuqing actually regards this not as a violation of laws and disciplines, but as the first major event of the violation of laws and disciplines in Beijing. Huang Ziqing believes that everything that is beneficial to the majority of people is "right," otherwise it is "wrong," and the leadership of the Party is "right."
    Huang Ziqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, first talked about the importance of this rectification campaign in his speech. Then he said: Many of the opinions raised this time are excessive. I want to say a word, and some people may say that I am a "defender of morality" or a "Goetheist" (referring to singing praises). There have been right and wrong since ancient times, and people must have a sense of right and wrong. I think that everything that is beneficial to the majority of people is "right," otherwise it is "wrong," and the leadership of the Party is "right." Since liberation, the situation of workers, peasants, and intellectuals has been better than before liberation. Before liberation, I almost starved to death, and a month's salary would be used up in three days. In Kunming, in order to eat, I sometimes taught twenty-four hours of class a week. The current life cannot be compared with the past. I am not afraid of people saying that I am a "Goetheist" or a "defender of morality." The leadership of the Party must be affirmed.
    Huang Ziqing also said: The Communist Party should be said to be right where it is right, and it should be criticized where it is wrong, taking right and wrong as the standard. However, in any movement, there will always be deviations, and there will always be some situations that are beyond the scope, which is not surprising. I believe that this situation will still occur in communist society. According to this spirit, the Communist Party can criticize the wrong opinions raised by the democratic parties this time, but do not make those who "let go" of the wrong things afraid to speak.
    Dong Weichuan said: Some intellectuals are very arrogant and dissatisfied with the entire Party.
    Dong Weichuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, used concrete facts to illustrate that there is a distance between the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals and workers and peasants. He said that some intellectuals are very arrogant, and some people are dissatisfied with the entire Party because of their personal interests. These people do not love the Party like the worker comrades.
    He also gave some examples to illustrate that the Party Committee of the Normal University has not yet taken the democratic parties seriously. Some people disagree with the criticism of Chu Anping.
    In the speeches of Chen Mingshao, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, and Gu Zhizhong, an alternate member of the Central Committee, they disagreed with some people's criticism of Chu Anping. Gu Zhizhong believes that there is still "punishment for speech"; he expressed doubts about the People's Daily's beginning to criticize some people's erroneous views, and he believes that this will affect everyone's free expression of opinions.
    Zhou Peiyuan believes that problems should be viewed from a socialist standpoint. The attitude of the People's Daily is correct and necessary.
    Zhou Peiyuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, first said in his speech: Letting go of speech cannot be separated from the socialist standpoint. There is no problem that the Communist Party has three major styles. The question is what kind of attitude we should take to deal with them. I think we should seek truth from facts and look at problems from a socialist standpoint. For several years, intellectuals have still been respected by the people. Especially after the Party's policy on intellectuals was put forward, we have played a great role and have been supported by the masses of the people. Based on this situation, I think Chu Anping's speech is problematic. Is the statement of "the Party's world" staying on the improper use of words, or is there a problem with ideological views? I don't think it is a simple problem of wording, but a problem of ideology.
    Zhou Peiyuan also talked about the issue of having positions and power. He said that he works in the Academic Affairs Office of Peking University and does not feel that he is a puppet. Party members and I have different opinions and argue. Someone below criticizes me as an "official." I am an official, and he is a civilian. This proves that I have a position and power.
    Some people say that the People's Daily is right, and the masses are left. I disagree. There should be a standard to distinguish between right and wrong. The People's Daily's editorial on the 8th was very correct and completely necessary. The opinions of the workers and other readers that were published are also correct. Allowing the publication of this kind of opinion should also allow the publication of another kind of opinion. It cannot be said that it is singing praises.

### 九三学社中央和北京分社委员座谈

    九三学社中央和北京分社委员座谈
    本报讯　九三学社中央常务委员会于昨日邀请九三学社在京中央委员、各部会负责人及九三学社北京市分社委员举行座谈会，座谈党与民主党派、党与非党知识分子关系、新形势下民主党派如何发挥作用等等问题，以便帮助党整风。
    会议开始，九三学社秘书长涂长望号召大家畅所欲言，帮助党整风。许德珩说：我们民主党派的人，要明辨是非，并且要明辨大的是非，才不致迷失方向。
    九三学社主席许德珩首先发言，他认为共产党开始整风以来，民主党派提了许多意见，这些意见总的讲起来是好的，大家过去藏在肚子里不愿讲的话都讲出来了，对帮助党整风、对今后发扬民主有很大作用。但是，在好的当中，不是没有问题，极大多数是好的，极个别的有片面的、甚至是错误的看法。比如部分人在大放大鸣中，有一点否定党的领导，并且否定人民民主专政，对社会主义方向仿佛还在踌躇，我认为这就是错误的。甚至在大放大鸣中，还有人写匿名信，恐吓提出他所不同意的意见的人，如卢郁文就收到这样的信，我认为这是极端恶劣的。
    接着，许德珩谈他对整风的看法。他说：帮助党整风的目的，是巩固和加强党的领导，为了更好地建设社会主义。恐怕我们九三学社同志都是一致的感觉：离开了党的领导，我们的前途是不堪设想的。帮助党整风，不说好的，都说坏的，不说好的，不等于否定好的，有人把好的一脚踢开，这样，就变成没有是非了，我们民主党派的人，要明辨是非，并且要明辨大的是非，才不致迷失方向。在座的只要三十岁以上的同志，都可以想想过去，比比现在，骑在我们头上的帝国主义被赶走了，卖国军阀政权被摧毁了，奇迹是说不清的，这是谁领导的结果，是共产党领导的结果，不要抹煞这个大的是非。有人说：不要共产党领导，他也不会卖国。我说，一个普通的人，要把国家卖掉，也不那么容易。不要共产党领导，是否是要蒋介石来呢？他来，就要卖国，台湾刘自然的事件，就要在大陆上出现，同时，我们要走社会主义道路，蒋介石是反对走社会主义道路的，他来，我不答应，九三学社的同志也不会答应。所以，在提意见的过程中，不要迷失政治方向。他相信九三学社的同志不会迷失政治方向。
    许德珩还谈到党与非党的“墙”和“沟”的问题，他说：有的地方墙筑得很坚固，沟挖得很深，所以拆墙填沟是这次整风的目的之一。解放以来，连续进行了几个大运动，这些运动基本上是好的，没有它，我们不能有今天，但是也有副作用，这些副作用是否是“墙、沟”形成的原因之一呢？从九三学社来说，要拆墙填沟，进一步搞好党与非党的团结，真正做到团结—批评—团结。因此，我们要把听到、想到、看到的好好讲出来，大鸣大放，现在还没有作到这一点。如南京师范学院调了一个院长助理，和他坐在一起办公，办了好久，师范学院的非党院长还不知道他是干什么的。这样的事我要他讲，他自己不愿讲，我要代他讲，他都不同意。所以我说“墙、沟”是双方面的，要双方面拆。还有讲了没有效，例如原在清华大学教书二十多年的张泽熙，1952年到唐山工学院，评级时把过去的学生评成二级，却把他评成三级，他向我讲，我提了意见，但是，没有解决。为什么评成三级？据说因为他不是唐山工学院成长起来的，这是宗派主义吧！这时有人插言：不完全如此，高教部曾说，只要唐山工学院提出二级他们就可以批了，可是唐山工学院提了几次，一直不见批下来。许德珩说：这是官僚主义吧！三害之中，两害俱全，不是官僚主义，就是宗派主义。最后，许德珩号召大家为了帮助党整风，我们九三学社的同志应当不要有顾虑，把所有的话都讲出来。
  杨肇燫建议对于一些重大问题，九三学社可以组织名义向共产党中央提出意见。
    九三学社中央常务委员杨肇燫在发言中建议对于一些重大问题九三学社可以组织名义向共产党中央提出意见，比如人事制度问题，普遍认为这个问题很大，好多单位人事科都是党、团员，人事制度应该由党掌握是没有问题的，但是一些很能干、公正的非党人士也可参加一些，如科学院尽是些大知识分子，那么一些毛孩子怎么掌握？这个问题九三学社作为组织向党提出，值得严重考虑，否则，就是整了风，官僚主义还是没有办法。
  孙承佩认为，对于错误的有危害作用的言论，必须指出，以便辨明是非。如果任其鱼目混珠，对整风的正常进行，有极大害处。
    九三学社中央常务委员孙承佩认为在大鸣大放中，不应有清规戒律，他说大鸣大放之中，必然有片面的以至错误的意见。共产党员难免犯错误，党外人士也难免犯错误。我们提倡实事求是，但是不可苛求或者限制。但是他认为，对于错误的有危害作用的言论，也必须指出，以便辨明是非。如果任其鱼目混珠，那对于整风的正常进行，对于社会主义事业，都有极大的害处。
    陈新桂所说的无产阶级专政是一切矛盾的根源的论点是严重的错误，是颠倒黑白。
    接着，他对陈新桂在民盟中央小组会的发言进行了批评，陈所说的无产阶级专政是一切矛盾的根源的论点，他认为这是严重的错误，这是颠倒黑白。他说我们的人民民主专政，也就是无产阶级专政，它解决了帝国主义统治和中国人民的矛盾，解决了地主和农民的矛盾，解决了资本主义与社会主义的矛盾。工人阶级与资产阶级是对抗性的阶级，但是中共没有使其激化成对抗性矛盾，而是用和平改造的办法，使其转化为非对抗性矛盾，逐步加以解决。这是制造矛盾呢，还是解决矛盾？共产党还在领导我们建设强大的社会主义工业国，解决人类与自然的矛盾。不错，我们人民内部还有矛盾，这些矛盾的原因是很复杂的。有的是生产力和生产关系的矛盾，反映为人民内部的矛盾，有的是一些共产党组织和党员犯有三大主义的错误因而造成的，有的是由于建设社会主义刚刚开始，经验不足实践不够，因之我们还不可能全面掌握社会主义建设的规律。
    他对陈新桂所说无产阶级专政是官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的根源的论点也作了批判，他认为这也是颠倒是非，是一种诬蔑。
    储安平讲的“党天下”是一切宗派主义的最终根源的意见，是有危害作用的混淆是非。
    他还对储安平讲“党天下”是一切宗派主义的最终根源的意见提出批评，他说：大家记得，解放以前，国民党是典型的“党天下”，当时是党外无党，党内有派，而解放以后，在共产党领导之下恰恰相反是党外有党，党内无派。以我社为例，解放前是非法的，解放后合法了，到现在社员人数已发展到解放前的六十倍。这不是中共帮助我们的结果吗？中共还提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。从解放以来，我社就参加了国家事务的管理，以宪法草案为例，我们反复地讨论过，提了不少意见。在政府机关中，我社有部长、司局长，院校长、研究所所长就更多了。我社社员大部分都是头儿，解放以前则绝对没有这么些头儿。其中有人有职有权，有人有职无权或权不多。但多数情况是在逐步好转。可以说总的情况是日益广泛和有效地参加国家事务。这怎能说是“党天下”“清一色”呢？
    李祖荫批评储安平的发言是“凭空之谈”“主观之见”；杨玉清的发言极不正确。
    李祖荫的发言首先就肯定了我们的国家必须要有共产党的领导，他说，没有共产党，就没有新中国，这是毫无疑问的。但共产党是不是有缺点，是不是有“三害”，他肯定是有的，否则就用不着整风了。
    接着，他批评了我们某些党的组织和共产党员的宗派主义思想作风。他说，我以前因为批评共产党受过打击，也许有人以为我对批评要消极了，我偏没消极，我在国务院举行的座谈会上也好，在法制委员会的座谈会上也好，还是要提出批评，因为我要对党负责。从1949年我就参加工作了，我遇到过很多事都可以说明共产党的某些党员有宗派主义，我只举一个例子。1951年我在法制委员会工作，一次人民大学的苏联民法专家召开座谈会，因为我是民事法规委员会的主任委员，就被邀参加了。会上，苏联专家要我谈一下中国民法和婚姻法起草的情况，我作了四十分钟的发言。苏联专家认为我讲得很好，有根有据，我真受宠若惊。当时法制委员会委员、党支部书记李光灿也参加了座谈会。想不到李光灿一回来就在别人面前批评我在这次座谈会上的发言是“夸夸其谈”。他认为这种宗派主义情绪，现在在法制委员会还存在着。
    其次，他谈到对错误的意见提出批评的问题，他认为最近在各种座谈会上有些议论是错误的，他说，对这些错误的意见可以批评，因为既然叫争鸣，就一定有批评。他还说，很多人在发言中总会说，我讲的不一定正确，请大家批评，但当大家真要批评的时候，他又不同意了。
    最后，他对在中共中央统战部座谈会上储安平的发言和国务院座谈会上杨玉清的发言提出了尖锐的批评。他认为储安平的发言是极端错误的。他说，储安平不会不懂法律，更不会不懂宪法。按照宪法的规定我们国家的最高权力机关是全国人民代表大会和它的常委会而不是国务院。而在全国人民代表大会常委会中有共二十个民主人士担任着副委员长的职务。储安平为什么不看到重要的而看次要的呢？为什么在国务院副总理中间有没有民主人士斤斤计较呢？而在国务院之下的各个部有差不多四分之一的部长是民主人士，我们九三学社的许德珩主席，就是水产部部长。所以，我认为储安平的发言是凭空之谈，主观之见，没有从实际出发，没有物质基础。
    对杨玉清的发言，他说，是我亲耳听见的，我觉得极不正确。他说杨玉清的主要论点就是要共产党下台，甚至说“你们都下台”，我不知道这个你们是指谁。最荒谬的是他说共产党的违法乱纪从北京开始，中央最乱。杨玉清为什么会有这种认识呢？他的根据是这样：他的父亲是个地主，土改期间跑到北京来了，当地农民就派代表到北京通过公安系统把他父亲弄回去了。我想，就是共产党员有这样一个父亲也要被弄回去的，而杨玉清居然把这并不是违法乱纪的事看成是北京违法乱纪的第一件大事。黄子卿认为凡是对大多数人有利的就是“是”，否则就是“非”，党的领导就是“是”。
    九三学社中央常务委员黄子卿在发言中，首先谈了这次整风的重要性。接着他说：这次提的意见有很多是过火的，我要说一句话，有人可能说我是“卫道者”、“歌德派”（指歌功颂德）。从古以来都有是非，人要有是非感，我认为凡是对大多数人有利的就是“是”，否则就是“非”，党的领导就是“是”。解放以后，工人、农民、知识分子的情况都比解放以前好了。解放前，我几乎饿死，一个月的薪水三天就用完，在昆明时为了吃饭，有时一周教二十四小时的课，现在的生活和过去不能相比，我不怕人家说我是“歌德派”、“卫道者”，党的领导要肯定。
    黄子卿还说：共产党对的地方就该说对，不对的就该批评，以是非为标准。不过，凡是一个运动，总会有偏差，总会有一些出乎范围的情况，不足为奇，我相信到共产主义社会还会出现这种情况。根据这一精神，这次民主党派提的意见，不对的，共产党可以批评，但是不要使“放”的不对的人不敢说话。
  董渭川说：有些知识分子自高自大很严重，对整个党不满意。
    九三学社中央常务委员董渭川用具体事实说明知识分子和工人、农民的思想感情有距离。他说有些知识分子自高自大很严重，有些人因为个人利害关系，就对整个党不满意，这些人就不像工人同志那样热爱党。
    他还举出一些例子，说明师大党委还没有把民主党派看在眼里。有些人不同意对储安平的批评
    九三学社中央委员陈明绍，候补中央委员顾执中等人的发言中，不同意一些人对储安平的批评。顾执中认为现在还是“言者有罪”；他对人民日报开始批评一些人的错误观点表示怀疑，他认为这样会影响大家畅所欲言。
  周培源认为：应从社会主义立场看问题。人民日报的态度是正确的，必要的。
    九三学社中央常务委员周培源在发言中首先说：放鸣不能离开社会主义的立场，共产党有三个主义是没有问题的，问题是我们以怎样的态度来对待，我认为应该实事求是，从社会主义立场看问题。几年以来，知识分子还是受到人民尊重的，特别是党对知识分子的政策提出来以后，我们发挥了很大作用，得到人民群众拥护。根据这一情况看，我认为储安平的发言是有问题的，“党天下”的说法是停留在用字不恰当上呢？还是思想观点上有问题呢？我看不是单纯措辞上的问题，而是思想上的问题。
    周培源还谈到有职有权的问题，他说他在北京大学教务处工作，就不觉得自己是傀儡，党员和我有不同意见就争论，下面有人批评我是“官”。我是官，他是民，这就证明我有职有权。
    有人说，人民日报是右了，群众是左了，我不同意，应该有个标准，分清正确与否。人民日报8日的社论批判得很正确，完全必要。登出的工人还有其他读者的意见，也是对的。允许发表这一种意见，也应该允许发表另一种意见，不能说成是歌功颂德。
