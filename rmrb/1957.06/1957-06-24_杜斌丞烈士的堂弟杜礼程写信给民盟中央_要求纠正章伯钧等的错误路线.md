Xinhua News Agency, Xi’an, 20th - Du Li-cheng, a member of the China Democratic League (CDL), former head of the CDL Northwest General Branch and cousin of Du Bin-cheng Martyr, today published a letter to the CDL Central Committee in the Shaanxi Daily, demanding the thorough correction of the erroneous line of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and suggesting that the CDL Central Committee immediately convene an enlarged meeting to remove Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji from their posts.

Du Li-cheng said in his letter that the CDL accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party at its inception, but unexpectedly, the leaders of the League, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and others, dared to blatantly violate the League's charter, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and attempted with ulterior motives to confuse the public and shake the people's democratic dictatorship in order to endanger the foundation of the country. Are such people fit to be leaders of our League? He demanded that the League Central Committee thoroughly correct the erroneous line of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and suggested that the League Central Committee convene an enlarged meeting to remove Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji from their posts.

Du Bin-cheng Martyr, along with Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng Martyrs, participated in the "December 12th" Incident in 1936. Du Bin-cheng served successively as the head of the CDL Northwest General Branch and a standing member of the CDL Central Committee, making great contributions to League affairs, actively opposing Chiang Kai-shek, and was arrested by the Kuomintang in Xi'an in March 1947, and died heroically in Xi'an in October of the same year.

    杜斌丞烈士的堂弟杜礼程写信给民盟中央
    要求纠正章伯钧等的错误路线
    本报特约新华社西安20日电 民盟盟员、原民盟西北总支委员会负责人和民盟中央常委杜斌丞烈士的堂弟杜礼程，今天在陕西日报上发表一封给民盟中央的信，要求彻底纠正章伯钧、罗隆基的错误路线，建议民盟中央立即召开扩大会议撤销章伯钧、罗隆基的职务。
    杜礼程信中说，民盟在建立之初，已接受中国共产党的领导，不料盟的领导人章伯钧、罗隆基等人竟敢明目张胆地违背盟章，反对共产党的领导，别有用心地企图惑乱人心，动摇人民民主专政以危及国本。这样的人配做我们盟的领导吗？他要求盟中央彻底纠正章伯钧、罗隆基的错误路线，并建议盟中央召开扩大会议，撤销章伯钧、罗隆基的职务。
    杜斌丞烈士和张学良、杨虎城烈士于1936年参加了“双十二”义举。杜斌丞曾先后担任过民盟西北总支委员会负责人、民盟中央常务委员，对盟务贡献巨大，积极反蒋，1947年3月在西安被国民党逮捕，同年10月慷慨就义于西安。
