Concerning "Made of Special Material"…
—A Discussion with Mr. Zhang Naiqi
Xiǎo Yǎ
    When Lenin passed away in 1924, Stalin made a vow in memory of Lenin, beginning with: "We communists are people with a special character. We are made of special material." Mr. Zhang Naiqi recently mentioned this sentence in one of his articles (published in the People's Daily on May 14th). He believes that "Due to the influence of this sentence, many non-Party members may view Party members with special eyes, and some Party members with insufficient cultivation may inevitably consider themselves special. Thus, this sentence naturally becomes an ideological basis for ‘walls’ and ‘trenches’." Mr. Zhang Naiqi also said, "I have not yet found any objective need for Stalin to say this at the time; judging solely from the words, this sentence is unscientific and carries a mystical color. The saying that communists are made of special material will immediately be understood as: communists are born with the material to be communists. ..."

    I disagree with Mr. Zhang Naiqi's statements.

    Stalin's sentence cannot be understood "solely from the words." For example, the "Communist Manifesto" begins with: "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism." If this sentence is "judged solely from the words," it also seems "unscientific" and "carries a mystical color." If "judged solely from the words," many, many such "unscientific" and "mystical" sentences can be found in the classic works of Marxism. Can we blame the classic writers of Marxism for this? I don't think so. The problem is that some people think that every word and sentence of the classic works of Marxism is the language of a rigid textbook, as if the classic works of Marxism should have a "stern face," with no emotion, no poetry, and every sentence a straightforward political slogan. To "immediately" understand Stalin's statement that "communists are made of special material" as "communists are born with the material to be communists," there are indeed people who understand it that way, but their understanding is indeed childish and ridiculous.

    Julius Fučík wrote an inspiring political commentary, "Under the Banner of Communism" (note), which also quoted Stalin's vow in memory of Lenin: "We communists are people with a special character..." Fučík said: "Yes!" He then elaborated on Stalin's statement, saying that communists love life, love freedom, love labor... "Therefore, when it is necessary to sacrifice our lives to open the way to a true, free, complete, joyful, and authentic life, we do not hesitate." He said:

    "This refers to you, comrade communist, you, soldier of Lenin's army. Wherever you work, wherever you fight for the freedom of mankind on any outpost of the revolution, wherever you are—on the front line or in the torture chamber of the enemy's prison—you must always ask yourself every day: Am I worthy of the glory of being a soldier of the great Lenin's army? Can I faithfully fulfill the oath that Comrade Stalin read on my behalf? Have I trained myself to be able to complete the tasks that history has entrusted to us in the future?"

    This is how Fučík understood Stalin's words. We have already seen in "Report from the Gallows" what kind of special character he possessed! What kind of special material he was made of!

    It is very clear that the so-called "special character" and "special material" are different from the "noble blood" that the old French aristocracy boasted flowed in their veins. Rather, it means that as the vanguard fighters of the working class, communists bear great historical tasks, dedicate themselves to a lofty ideal, and must possess a dauntless spirit of self-sacrifice; they must possess the noble character of revolutionaries never seen before, and, in Chairman Mao's words, the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Has every communist achieved this? We cannot say that. However, there is no doubt that every communist should require themselves to achieve this.

    Of course, there are also other bad communists, communists suffering from serious subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy. Some of them often consider themselves "special," but their "special" is a "special" that stands on the heads of others, not a "special" that serves the people, a "special" of enjoying happiness first, not a "special" of enduring hardship first. Their actions are completely unrelated to the "special character" and "special material" of true communism.

    Mr. Zhang Naiqi said that "some Party members with insufficient cultivation," after reading Stalin's words, became complacent and considered themselves "special." This situation is not non-existent; however, we cannot therefore devalue Stalin's words as the "ideological basis" of "walls" and "trenches." There is an ancient Chinese legend: the same honey, Liu Xiahui saw it and said it could be used to be filial to one's parents, while Daozhi saw it and said it could be used to stick door bolts; there is also a European saying: "A thief can find his own language from a philosopher," but we cannot therefore say that the philosopher is the thief's advocate. I ask: if chauvinists distortedly cite Lenin's "On the National Pride of the Great Russians," if despotic and willful people one-sidedly cite Engels' "The Role of Violence in History," then, can these two works also be devalued as their ideological basis? I don't think so.

    In recent times, finding fault with Stalin's works seems to have become fashionable. Indeed, from today's perspective, there are some outdated and erroneous things in Stalin's works. But even correct things, including the correct things of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, if understood as dogma, taken out of context, "judged solely from the words," without understanding their spirit and essence, can also lead to nothing. Isn't the sentence about "made of special material" an example?

    关于“特殊材料制成的”……
    ——和章乃器先生商榷
    小雅
    1924年列宁逝世的时候，斯大林作了追悼列宁的誓词，一开头就说：“我们共产党人是具有特种性格的人。我们是由特殊材料制成的。”章乃器先生最近在他的一篇文章里（发表于5月14日人民日报）提到了这一句话，他认为：“由于这一句话的影响，可能有不少非党人士便以特殊的眼光看待党员，某些修养不够的党员，也就不免以特殊自居了。这样，这一句话自然也就成为‘墙’和‘沟’的一种思想基础了。”章乃器先生又说：“我还没有找寻出来斯大林当时说这句话有什么客观需要；单从文字看来，这句话是不科学的，是带着神秘主义的色彩的。共产党员是特殊材料制成的说法马上就会被理解为：共产党员一生出来就是做共产党员的材料。……”
    我不同意章乃器先生的这些说法。
    斯大林的这句话不能“单从文字”去理解。比如，“共产党宣言”开头就这么说：“一个怪影在欧洲游荡着——共产主义的怪影”。这句话，如果“单从文字看来”，好像也是“不科学”的，也是“带着神秘主义的色彩的”；如果“单从文字看来”，这种“不科学”的、“带着神秘主义色彩”的句子，还可以从马克思主义的经典著作中找出很多很多。这能不能怪马克思主义的经典作家呢？我看不能。问题在于，有些人以为马克思主义经典著作的一字一句，都是刻板的教科书的语言，好像马克思主义经典著作就应该“铁青着面孔”，没有感情、没有诗意，句句都是直截了当的政治口号。把斯大林所说“共产党员是特殊材料制成的”，“马上”理解为“共产党员一生出来就是做共产党员的材料”，这种人的确不是没有，但是他们的理解也的确是幼稚可笑的。
    伏契克写过一篇激动人心的政论“在共产主义的旗帜下”（注），文章里也引用了斯大林在追悼列宁的誓词中所说的这段话“我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人……”伏契克说：“是的！”他接着阐发了斯大林的这段话，他说，共产党员热爱生活、热爱自由、热爱劳动……“所以当为了开辟通向真正的、自由的、完满与欢乐的、名副其实的生活的道路而需要牺牲自己的生命时，我们毫不犹豫。”他说：
    “这指的是你，共产党员同志、是你，列宁军队的战士。无论你在何处工作、无论你在革命的任何前哨为人类的自由而战斗，无论你在何处——在前沿阵地或是在敌人监狱的拷问室里——你永远都要天天反躬自问一下：我不愧作为一个伟大列宁军队底战士的光荣吗？能够忠诚地履行斯大林同志代表我所宣读的誓词吗？我已经锻炼得能够在将来完成历史交付给我们的任务吗？”
    伏契克就是这样理解斯大林的话的。我们已经在“绞索套着脖子时的报告”中看到，他究竟是一个具有如何的特种性格的人！是一个由怎样的特殊材料制成的人！
    很显然的，所谓“特种性格”和“特殊材料”，不同于旧时法国贵族所自诩的在他们身上流着“高贵的血液”。而是说，作为工人阶级的先锋战士的共产党员，担负着伟大的历史任务，献身于一个崇高的理想，他们必须具有大无畏的、自我牺牲的精神；必须具有前所未有的革命者的高尚品格，用毛主席的话来说，就是全心全意为人民服务的精神。是不是每个共产党员都做到这一点了？不能这样说。但是，每个共产党员都应该要求自己做到这一点，却是毫无疑义的。
    当然，也有另外一些不好的共产党员，患有严重的主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义的共产党员。他们之中有些人，往往以“特殊”自居，然而他们的“特殊”，是站在别人头上的“特殊”而不是为人民服务的“特殊”，是享福在先的“特殊”而不是吃苦在先的“特殊”。他们的所作所为，和真正共产主义的“特殊性格”和“特殊材料”是毫不相干的。
    章乃器先生说，“某些修养不够的党员”，看了斯大林的话，竟飘飘然以“特殊”自居了。这种情形也不是没有；但是不能据此就把斯大林的话贬为“墙”和“沟”的“思想基础”。我国古代有个传说：同样是蜜糖，柳下惠看了说可以孝亲，盗跖看了却说可以粘门闩；欧洲也有句俗话说：“小偷可以从哲人那里找到自己的语言”，但是不能据此就说哲人是小偷的辩护人。试问：如果沙文主义者歪曲地援引了列宁的“论大俄罗斯人底民族自傲心”，如果专横恣肆的人片面地援引了恩格斯的“暴力在历史中的作用”，那么，是不是也可以把这二篇著作贬为他们的思想基础？我看是不可以的。
    最近一个时期以来，在斯大林的著作中找岔子似乎已成为赶时髦的事情。诚然，从现在看来，斯大林的著作中有若干是过时的、错误的东西。但就是正确的东西，包括马、恩、列的正确的东西，如果当做教条来理解，断章取义，“单从文字看来”，而不体会其精神实质，也还会弄到一无是处的，关于“特殊材料制成的”这句话，不就是一个例子么？
