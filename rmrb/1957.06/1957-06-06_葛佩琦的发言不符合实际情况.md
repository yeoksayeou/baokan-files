    Ge Peiqi's Speech Doesn't Match Reality

    I have some different opinions regarding the speech given by lecturer Ge Peiqi in the news "Renmin University of China Continues to Hold Symposium" on page 7 of the People's Daily on May 31st.

    Mr. Ge said in his speech: "Who are the people whose living standards have improved? The Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes are now riding in small cars and wearing woolen uniforms," implying that only the living standards of Party members and cadres have improved, while the living standards of most people have not. This does not match reality. Take me, for example. Before liberation, my family suffered from famine and couldn't eat anything. I was forced to move to the city to become a textile worker. After working for three or four years, my monthly income was barely enough to buy cornbread and millet porridge, and I couldn't even afford a good piece of clothing. Now, ordinary technicians earn sixty to seventy yuan a month. They not only eat rice and white flour, but also wear fabric pants. Many people even wear watches and ride bicycles. The lives of farmers have also improved a lot. Before liberation, they ate bran and vegetables for half the year and thin gruel regularly. My family of five couldn't eat three pounds of meat a year. Now, we buy ten or more pounds for festivals, and even slaughter a fat pig for the Spring Festival. In the past, we ate mostly bran and vegetables, just to "fool our stomachs," now we also eat rice. My home is in Shibaozi Village, Yi County, Liaoning Province. In the whole village of one hundred and fifty households, one hundred and twenty households didn't have enough to eat in the past. Now that they have joined the cooperative, everyone has enough to eat. In the past, only landlords had stoves for heating in winter. Last winter, almost all the farmers had "foreign stoves" and "earth stoves." Many households have also bought sewing machines. In the past, they wore homespun cloth, but now they wear fine colored cloth, and some even buy gabardine. In the past, life was hard, and there was no mood for fun. Now that everyone's living standards have improved, they have also started cultural activities in the village. If you talk about the past life, who doesn't hate the old society! Who doesn't support the Communist Party! Whose life is not good? Of course, the exploiting classes who ride on the backs of the people are not as good as they used to be, and they will resent the Communist Party.

    I think Mr. Ge Peiqi should step out of the office and go to the homes of real workers and farmers to see for himself. Then he will feel that his speech has no mass base and does not match reality.

### 葛佩琦的发言不符合实际情况

    葛佩琦的发言不符合实际情况
    我对5月31日人民日报第七版“中国人民大学继续举行座谈会”的新闻中葛佩琦讲师的发言，有些不同看法。
    葛先生发言中说：“生活水平提高的是哪些人呢？过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的党员和干部”，意思是指只有党员、干部的生活水平提高了，而大多数人民生活的水平都没有提高。这是不符合实际情况的。拿我来说，解放前家里闹粮荒，什么都吃不上，被迫流入城市当了纺织工人，干了三、四年，一个月除了刚够吃窝窝头、小米粥外，连一件好衣服都买不起。现在一般技工每月收入六十到七十元，不但吃大米、白面，还穿个料子裤，许多人还带上手表，骑上自行车。农民生活也提高了很多，解放前都是半年糠菜半年粮，常喝糊糊。我家五口人一年吃不上三斤肉，现在过个节就买个十来斤，过春节还杀口肥猪。过去尽吃糠菜、“糊弄顿”，现在也吃干饭了。我家在辽宁省义县石堡子村，全村一百五十户，过去有一百二十户粮不够吃，现在入了社，全都够吃。过去只有地主家在冬天生个炉子取暖，去年冬天农民差不多都生了“洋炉子”和“地闷”。还有很多户买了缝纫机，过去穿土布，现在都是带色的细布，有的还单买华达呢。过去生活苦，那有心情玩乐，现在大家生活提高了，也把村里的文化活动开展起来了。如果提起过去生活，那个不恨旧社会！那个不拥护共产党啊！什么人生活不好了呢？当然那些骑在人民头上的剥削阶级是不如过去了，他们是会怀恨共产党的。
    我认为葛佩琦先生应该走出办公室，到真正的工人、农民家里去看看，就会感到自己的发言是没有群众基础的，是不符合实际情况的。
