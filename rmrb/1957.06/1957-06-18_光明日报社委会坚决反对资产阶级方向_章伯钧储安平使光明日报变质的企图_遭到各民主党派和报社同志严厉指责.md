　　Guangming Daily Committee Firmly Opposes Bourgeois Orientation
　　Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's Attempts to Degrade Guangming Daily Subjected to Severe Criticism by Various Democratic Parties and Newspaper Comrades
　　(Reported by Guangming Daily) The Guangming Daily Committee, composed of representatives from various democratic parties, held consecutive meetings on the 15th and 16th to discuss and examine the bourgeois political orientation of Guangming Daily in the past period, as well as the reasons and responsibilities for Chu Anping's erroneous "Party Empire" remarks published under the name of "Editor-in-Chief of Guangming Daily." After two days of discussion, the meeting initially clarified the political responsibility for these errors and unanimously agreed that the Committee should request the central committees of the various democratic parties to conduct discussions.
　　The following attended the Committee meetings on these two days: Yan Xichun (China Zhi Gong Party, Liu Jinhan substituting), Yan Xinmin (Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Wang Shanji substituting on the second day), Chu Anping, Wang Kunlun (Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang), Yang Dongchun (China Association for Promoting Democracy), Li Chunqing (Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League), Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi (China National Democratic Construction Association), and Sa Kongliao (China Democratic League). Li Yi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, and some staff members of Guangming Daily attended as observers.
　　At the meeting on the 15th, Zhang Bojun, President of Guangming Daily, spoke first, making a statement on Chu Anping's issue. He said: "I bear political responsibility for Chu Anping's work at Guangming Daily."
　　Committee members exchanged views on Chu Anping's issue. Chu Anping described his situation during his two months at Guangming Daily. The Director and Deputy Director of the Guangming Daily Editorial Office
　　Expose Chu Anping's Erroneous Newspaper Management Guidelines
　　Then Gao Tian, Director of the Guangming Daily Editorial Office, and Zhang You, Deputy Director, spoke on behalf of the newspaper staff, demonstrating from Chu Anping's series of actual practices and his newspaper management proposals that Chu Anping had been steering Guangming Daily towards a bourgeois political direction during these two months. After arriving at Guangming Daily, Chu Anping first promoted his newspaper management ideas. For example, Chu believed that today it is mainly necessary to learn from the work experience of old newspapers before liberation; he did not agree that newspapers have a guiding and promoting role. Chu believed that newspapers are only responsible for publishing news, and thus there is a fundamental contradiction between newspapers and the Communist Party and the People's Government, that is, some news that newspapers want to publish is news that the Party and government do not want to publish. In the work of "airing views and releasing information," his proposition was to constantly expose, believing that exposing is the task of newspapers, while analyzing contradictions and resolving contradictions is not the responsibility of newspapers. In specific work, Chu did so by organizing seminars in nine major cities, publishing tens of thousands of words of seminar records, all of which were so-called "exposures."
　　Gao Tian and Zhang You further reported Chu Anping's views on the newspaper's commentary work. He believed that before he came to the newspaper, Guangming Daily had two types of editorials: one was editorials of praise and merit, referring to editorials that elaborated on achievements; the other was well-balanced and dogmatic editorials. Therefore, he advocated that if editorials are to be written, they should be his so-called "supervisory" editorials.
　　After Gao Tian and Zhang You spoke, Chu Anping admitted that he had bourgeois ideology. He said: "Except for individual discrepancies, the report is factual, and what I did was wrong."
　　Sa Kongliao suggested that representatives of the democratic parties convey this issue to their respective central committees for discussion.
　　Wang Kunlun said that Guangming Daily is the organ of the various democratic parties, and the central committees of the democratic parties should pay close attention to this issue. He said, "Chu admits that he has bourgeois ideology. I think we should now examine who should be responsible for that period of bourgeois political orientation. I want to ask, why didn't the President convene the Committee to discuss editorial policy? Zhang Bojun was recommended by the parties to be the President. Did he read the newspaper? What is your own direction? What are your opinions?"
　　Yang Dongchun, Li Yi, and others spoke, agreeing with Wang Kunlun's views.
　　Finally, Zhang Bojun spoke, expressing his agreement to examine the work, and that he would bear the political responsibility for the errors that occurred during this period. He also stated that he had not seen Chu Anping's remarks published under the name of Editor-in-Chief of Guangming Daily beforehand. He finally said to Chu Anping: "I want to ask Comrade Chu Anping to make good preparations, surrender to the truth, admit mistakes, and take responsibility. We all have bourgeois thoughts, but they can be corrected."
　　Zhang Bojun admitted that he had made mistakes. But he said the reason was that he was "insensitive and did not understand newspaper matters too much."
　　At the beginning of the meeting on the 16th, Zhang Bojun made supplementary explanations, believing that the criticism from the Committee members was correct. It was wrong not to hold a meeting to discuss such a big matter. Since Chu Anping had made erroneous remarks and the newspaper's direction had also become problematic, it was also wrong not to convene a meeting in a timely manner. But he believed that this was due to his insensitivity and that he himself had also made mistakes and was preoccupied with his own problems and feeling heavy-hearted. Then he said that after Chu Anping's erroneous remarks were published, he also felt that Guangming Daily had difficulties in terms of direction and line. He said, "I don't understand newspaper matters too much."
　　Yang Dongchun immediately disagreed with this point. He believed that Zhang Bojun was not "too ignorant." When Yang Dongchun talked about this issue later in his speech, he said: "Comrade Zhang Bojun and I have been friends for more than twenty years and have worked together. I disagree with him saying that he is insensitive." Yang Dongchun believed that Zhang Bojun could not be explained by "insensitivity." After the incident happened, no meeting was held. Zhang said it was because he had made mistakes and was feeling heavy-hearted. But judging from Zhang's past political demeanor, it is not necessarily the case. Are there any ideological problems? I hope he will explain.
　　Yang Dongchun talked about the criticisms of Zhang Bojun from various aspects in the newspaper. He said that Zhang Bojun has received a lot of criticism and has also said a lot. Almost every time he is criticized, he says something; after another criticism, he says something again. Yang Dongchun believed that it is no wonder that outsiders have the impression that Zhang Bojun is two-faced. He particularly disagreed with the alternate commentary published by Zhang Bojun in Guangming Daily, believing that its content did not match Zhang Bojun's reality.
　　Li Yi said in his speech that some of Chu Anping's proposals coincided with some of Zhang Bojun's past proposals. He said that our Jiusan Society firmly advocates that Guangming Daily must adhere to the socialist direction. He emphasized criticizing the erroneous view of "publishing facts as they are" and recording everything without asking about the political impact.
　　After Wang Shanji and Zhang Naiqi spoke, Zhang Bojun spoke again. He said that there have been four news figures in the newspapers recently, and three of them are present (referring to Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, and himself). Luo Longji will be back soon. Today's meeting, which is examining our shortcomings, is not only good for Guangming Daily, but also good for the three of us. Zhang Bojun smiled and turned to Zhang Naiqi, saying that some people say that Chu Anping's "Party Empire" hit the nail on the head, referring to its seriousness. I think your saying yesterday that I am a "surrendering general" also hit the nail on the head, the ideological nail on the head. Zhang Bojun said that some people say that I am two-faced. I think I am not just two-faced, but multi-faceted. There is a side of capitalist thought, and there is also a side of socialist aspiration. There is also a side of feudal ideological residue. He said that the ancients said that "four knows" is false. I think there is only one know, that is, one knows one's own thoughts. I made mistakes in the rectification movement. I am willing to admit my mistakes and take this opportunity to correct them. I have ideological commonalities with Chu Anping, but there is no personal connection between us. Zhang Bojun said, Naiqi said that your self-criticism is too early! This is my mental burden. Naiqi is one faction and does not speak; I am not self-critical enough. Some people say that I am being squeezed and that I only speak when squeezed. Zhang Bojun said that after the publication of Lu Yuwen's speech, I received a letter congratulating me, saying that I am very good, supporting me, and scolding Lu; but after I spoke at the Central Group Seminar of the China Democratic League on June 9th, and the news was published, I received a long letter on the 11th, scolding me for being "shameless." The letter said that I had always placed hope on you, thinking that you had backbone, but after reading your speech yesterday, I knew that you were "afraid of death," "wanting to be an official," and "surrendering." Only then did I realize the seriousness of the matter. Zhang Bojun said that some people want to use the weaknesses of our right-leaning bourgeois thoughts to oppose the Communist Party. The first type of people support me, and the second type of people scold me, but the purpose is the same.
　　Zhang Bojun also said that the bourgeois thoughts of people like us have a foundation and consistency, and will be revived when the political situation changes. Therefore, I still ask Comrade Anping, including myself, to carefully examine this thought.
　　Li Chunqing asked Zhang Bojun: You said you were used by the rightists, are you a rightist? Zhang said, "On this issue, you can also say that I am a rightist."
　　Li Chunqing spoke, talking about his understanding of the mistakes of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping. He believes that talking about the political direction of Guangming Daily and Chu Anping's speech is not an issue of bourgeois thought. He said, what is being raised today is the issue of anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. Do you admit this point? If you admit this point, you should treat it seriously and not "talk and laugh happily." (Note: Zhang Naiqi mentioned in his speech that one should be at ease and talk about it easily and happily.) Then Li Chunqing asked Zhang Bojun: You said you were used by the rightists, then are you a rightist yourself? Zhang Bojun said, on this issue, you can also say that I am a rightist.
　　Li Chunqing criticized Zhang Bojun for not discussing matters related to Guangming Daily with the various democratic parties. He said that the President is entrusted by the various democratic parties and bears the highest responsibility. Who should bear the primary responsibility for the current mistakes? In my opinion, only the President should be questioned. Zhang Bojun said, I bear political responsibility. Li Chunqing then asked: Do you agree with Chu Anping's policy of "only exposing"? What is your political line for running Guangming Daily? There must be some ideas, what are these ideas? The comrades in the editorial department believe that they are going to run a newspaper of the opposition party. What do you think? Do you want to run a newspaper of the opposition party?
　　Li Chunqing then asked: After Chu Anping's speech was published, what did you think after reading it? Zhang Bojun said, I disagree. Li Chunqing asked, he published it in the name of the Editor-in-Chief, why didn't you ask or make a statement if you disagreed?
　　Finally, Li Chunqing suggested bringing these situations back to the internal discussions of the various democratic parties, and then returning to the Committee for discussion. Sa Kongliao, Yang Dongchun, Wang Kunlun and others expressed their agreement.
　　At the meeting, Li Yi, Li Chunqing, and others strongly criticized Zhang Bojun, as the President of Guangming Daily, for not discussing matters related to Guangming Daily with the various democratic parties.
　　Zhang Bojun stated: (1) The President bears the primary responsibility, and the President will make a self-criticism. (2) Please convene a meeting of the central committees of the various democratic parties to discuss the Guangming Daily issue. (3) Before it is clarified, do not publish editorials on this matter for the time being. (4) Before Chu Anping returns to his post after taking leave, please the Committee agree to let Gao Tian be responsible for the actual work. Convene temporary meetings for major issues.
　　Zhang Naiqi made speeches at both days' meetings, but he stated that they should not be published. Wang Kunlun told the attending committee members that he had just received a call from Huang Yanpei, the Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association, to understand the meeting situation, because Zhang Naiqi, who represents the China National Democratic Construction Association in the Committee, never tells him about the meeting situation.
　　Chu Anping admitted that the statement about the "Party Empire" was wrong; at the same time, he stated that it was published in his personal name. It was his mistake to use the name of the Editor-in-Chief of Guangming Daily.
　　Wang Kunlun finally asked to face the seriousness of the problem. He believes that the issue of Chu Anping's erroneous remarks cannot be viewed in isolation.

　　光明日报社委会坚决反对资产阶级方向
　　章伯钧储安平使光明日报变质的企图
　　遭到各民主党派和报社同志严厉指责
    本报讯　据光明日报消息：由各民主党派的代表所组成的光明日报社务委员会，15、16两日连续开会，讨论和检查光明日报在过去一个时间内的资产阶级政治方向，以及储安平以“光明日报总编辑”名义发表“党天下”错误言论的原因和责任。会议经过两天的讨论，初步明确了这些错误的政治责任，一致同意由社务委员会要求各民主党派中央进行讨论。
    出席这两天社务会议的有：严希纯（中国致公党，刘锦汉代），严信民（农工民主党，第二天由王善继代），储安平，王昆仑（民革）。杨东莼（民主促进会），李纯青（台湾民主自治同盟），章伯钧，章乃器（民主建国会），萨空了（民盟）。列席的有九三学社中央委员会副秘书长李毅和光明日报部分工作人员。
    在15日的会议上，光明日报社长章伯钧首先发言，他对储安平的问题，作了声明，他说：对储安平在光明日报的工作，我要负政治责任。
    社务委员们对储安平的问题交换了意见。储安平叙述了他来光明日报两个多月的情况。光明日报总编室正副主任
    揭发储安平错误的办报方针
    接着光明日报总编室主任高天和副主任张友，代表报社的工作人员发言，他们从储安平的一系列的实际做法和他的办报主张，证明了储安平在这两个月里，是把光明日报拉向了资产阶级的政治方向。储安平到光明日报之后，首先宣传了他的办报主张，例如储认为：今天主要要学习解放前的旧报纸的工作经验；他不同意报纸有指导工作、推动工作的作用。储认为报纸只是管登新闻，因而在这个问题上，报纸和共产党、人民政府存在着根本的矛盾，即是有些新闻，报纸要登，党和政府不要登，在鸣和放的报道　工作中，他的主张是不断的揭露，并认为揭露是报纸的任务，而分析矛盾、解决矛盾不是报纸的责任。在具体工作中，储是这样做的，在九大城市组织了座谈会，发表了十几万字的座谈记录，都是所谓“揭露”的。
    高天和张友又进一步汇报了储安平对报纸言论工作的看法。他认为在他来报社以前，光明日报的社论有两种：一种是歌功颂德的社论。这是指阐述成绩的社论而言；一种是四平八稳、教条主义的社论。因此，他主张，要写社论，就要写他所谓的“监督”的社论。
    储安平在高天和张友发言之后，承认自己有资产阶级思想。他说：除了个别事例有出入外，汇报的是事实，他这样做是不对头的。
    萨空了建议各民主党派的代表转达自己的党派中央，讨论这个问题。
    王昆仑说，光明日报是各民主党派的机关报，各民主党派中央要好好过问，要重视这个问题。他说，储承认自己是资产阶级思想。我认为现在要检查那段资产阶级政治方向，究竟应由谁来负责。我要问，社长为什么不召集社委会讨论编辑方针？章伯钧是各党派推出来当社长的，有没有看报？你自己的方向如何？意见如何？
    杨东莼、李毅等发言，同意王昆仑的意见。
    最后章伯钧发言，他表示同意检查工作，他要负这段时间内发生的错误的政治责任。他并声明说储安平以光明日报总编辑名义发表的言论，事先没有看过。他最后对储安平说：“我要向储安平同志要求，应作很好的准备，向真理投降，承认错误，把责任担当起来。资产阶级思想，我们都有，然而可以改正。”
    章伯钧承认自己犯了错误。但他说原因是“感觉迟钝，太不懂报纸的事情”。
    16日的会议开始时，章伯钧又作补充说明，他认为，社务委员的责备是对的。这样大的事情，没有开会讨论，是错误的。既然储安平发表了错误言论，报纸方向也发生了问题，仍然没有及时开会，这也是错误的。但是他认为，这是由于他的感觉迟钝，同时他本人也犯了错误，成天在考虑自己的问题，心情沉重的缘故。接着他又说，在储安平的错误言论发表以后，他也感觉到光明日报在方针路线上有困难。他说，“我太不懂报纸的事情”。
    杨东莼对这一点立即表示不同意。他认为章伯钧并不是“太不懂”。杨东莼在后来发言中谈到这个问题的时候说：“我和章伯钧同志是二十多年的朋友，共同工作过。他说感觉迟钝，我是不同意的。”杨东莼认为，章伯钧是不能以“迟钝”来说明的。事情发生以后，没有开会。章说是因为自己犯了错误，心情沉重。但是照章过去政治风度来看，也不一定是这样。是不是思想上有什么问题？希望说明。
    杨东莼谈到报上各方面对章伯钧的批评。他说，章伯钧受了很多的批评，也说了很多的话。几乎是批评一次，说一些；又批评一次，又说一些。杨东莼认为，这就无怪乎外界对于章伯钧要有两面派的印象。他特别不同意章伯钧在光明日报上发表的代论，认为它的内容并不符合章伯钧的实际。
    李毅在发言中说，储安平有些主张，和章伯钧过去的有些主张，有不谋而合之处。他说，我们九三学社坚决主张，光明日报必须坚持社会主义的方向。他着重批判了“是事实就要发表”那种不问政治影响有闻必录的错误观点。
    在王善继和章乃器发言后，章伯钧再次发言。他说，近来报上有四个新闻人物，在座的就有三个（指章乃器、储安平和他自己），罗隆基很快也就要回来了。今天这样的会，检查毛病，不但对光明日报有好处，对我们三人，也有好处。章伯钧笑着转向章乃器说，有人说储安平的“党天下”击中了要害，这是指其严重性来说的。我看，你昨天说我是“投降将军”，倒也是击中了要害，思想上的要害。章伯钧说，有人说我两面，我看我还不止两面，还多一面。有资本主义思想的一面，也有社会主义愿望的一面。另外还有封建思想残余的一面。他说，古人说“四知”是假的，我想只有一知，自家心事自家知。我在整风运动中有错误，我愿意承认错误，乘此机会改正。我和储安平思想上有共同性，但人事上素没有联系。章伯钧说，乃器讲，你检讨太早啦！这是我的精神负担。乃器是一派，不发言；我是检讨不够，有人说是挤一下，说一下。章伯钧说，卢郁文的谈话发表以后，我接到一封恭维我的信，说我很好，拥护我，骂卢；但是6月9日我在民盟中央小组座谈会上发言，新闻发表后，我在11日又接到一封长篇来信，骂我“无耻”，信中说，我从来对你这人寄以希望，认为有骨气，看了你昨天的发言，知你“怕死”，“要做官”，“投降”。我这才了解事情的严重。章伯钧说，有人要利用我们右倾资产阶级思想的弱点，来反对共产党。第一种人拥护我，第二种人骂我，目的都一样。
    章伯钧又说，我们这些人的资产阶级思想是有根基的，有一贯性的，逢到政治形势改变，就会借尸还魂。因此我还是请安平同志，也包括我在内，要好好查一查这个思想。
    李纯青问章伯钧：你说你被右派利用了，你是不是右派？章说，“在这个问题上也可以说是右派。”
    李纯青发言，谈到他对章伯钧储安平错误的认识。他认为，谈到光明日报政治方向和储安平发言的问题，不是资产阶级思想问题。他说，今天提出的是反党反社会主义言论的问题，是否承认这一点？如果承认这一点，就应严肃对待，不能“谈笑风生，轻松愉快”。（按：章乃器在发言中曾提到，应该心安理得，轻松愉快来谈。）接着李纯青又问章伯钧：你说被右派利用了，那你自己是不是右派呢？章伯钧说，在这个问题上也可以说是右派。
    李纯青批评章伯钧关于光明日报的事不和各民主党派商量。他说，社长受各民主党派委托，负最高责任。现在的错误应由谁负主要责任？我看，应唯社长是问。章伯钧说，我负政治责任。李纯青又问道：你对储安平的“只管揭露”的方针同意不同意？你办光明日报的政治路线是怎样的？总有些想法，这些想法怎样？编辑部同志认为，是要被办成反对派的报纸，你自己是怎样考虑？是否要办成反对派报纸？
    李纯青接着问：储安平的发言发表后，你看后怎样想的？章伯钧说，我不同意。李纯青问，他是以总编辑名义发表的，既不同意为何不问，为何不声明？
    最后李纯青建议，把这些情况带回各民主党派内部讨论，然后再回到社委会来讨论。萨空了、杨东莼、王昆仑等表示同意。
    会上，李毅、李纯青等都对作为光明日报社长的章伯钧，就有关光明日报之事不同各民主党派商量，提出强烈批评。
    章伯钧声明：（1）社长负首要责任，社长做检讨。（2）光明日报问题请各民主党派中央开会讨论。（3）在未搞清楚前，暂不就此事发表社论。（4）在储安平请假未到职前，请社委会同意由高天负责实际工作。有重大问题召开临时会议。
    在两天的会上，章乃器都作了发言，但他声明不要发表。王昆仑告诉出席的各位委员，他刚接到民建主任委员黄任老（炎培）的电话，要了解会议情形，因为代表民建出席社委会的章乃器从来不把开会情况告诉他。
    储安平承认关于“党天下”的说法是错误的；同时他说明这是以个人名义发表的。署用光明日报总编辑名义是他的错误。
    王昆仑最后要求正视问题的严重性。他认为，不能孤立地看储安平错误言论的问题。
