Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 10th: U.S. journalist Al Alt Sheers, in the "Workers' Daily," commented on the appointment of big businessman Anderson as the U.S. Treasury Secretary, pointing out: "Another big capitalist who got rich from atomic energy has joined the government."

Sheers pointed out that Anderson served as the general manager of "Ventures Limited" before being appointed as Secretary. He said: "The new Treasury Secretary is connected to lethal bombs through three lines. First, uranium ore—atomic fuel—is one of the best territories of his mining empire; second, Anderson's company also manufactures fuel for lethal bombs. This company sold pure uranium to the Pentagon even before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Third, the nickel produced by Anderson's company is a raw material for the U.S. atomic enterprise, jet aircraft, and missiles."

Sheers said that according to "Barron's" materials, "Ventures Limited" controls "a mining empire worth more than $250 million," with investments in five continents—the two Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. In the United States, the uranium manufacturing plant in Massachusetts also belongs to it. It owns uranium mines in Uganda, Africa, as well as thorium, titanium, and other mines in Australia.

Sheers said that the "largest buyer" of the products of "Ventures Limited's" subsidiary, "Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited," is the U.S. Department of Defense. When Anderson previously held government positions (he used to be Secretary of the Navy and later Deputy Secretary of Defense), this company signed contracts with the U.S. government to sell large quantities of nickel. The nickel company belonging to Anderson is also closely colluding with "International Nickel Company," which is related to Secretary of State Dulles.

Sheers finally emphasized that as a member of the National Security Council, Anderson will be involved in deciding on the use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

　　美国新财长是什么角色？
　　靠原子发财的大资本家
    新华社10日讯  据塔斯社纽约9日讯：美国记者阿尔特·薛尔兹在“工人日报”上谈到任命大商人安德逊为美国财政部长这件事时指出：“又是一个靠原子发财的大资本家参加了政府。”
    薛尔兹指出，安德逊在被任命为部长以前担任过“文彻斯公司”的总经理。他说：“新任财政部长通过三条线同烈性炸弹联系起来。第一，铀矿——原子燃料——是他的矿业帝国的最好的领地之一；第二，安德逊的公司还制造烈性炸弹的燃料。这个公司在原子弹还没有投到广岛以前曾经把纯铀出售给五角大楼。第三，安德逊公司所生产的镍是美国原子企业、喷气飞机和导弹的原料。”
    薛尔兹说，根据“拜龙”周刊材料，“文彻斯公司”统治着“一个价值二亿五千多万美元的矿业帝国”，它在五大洲——两个美洲，亚洲，非洲，欧洲和澳大利亚——都有投资。在美国，马萨诸塞州的制造铀的工厂也是属于它的。它拥有非洲乌干达的铀矿，也拥有澳洲的钍矿、钛矿及其他矿。
    薛尔兹说：“文彻斯公司”的女儿公司——“福耳康布里奇镍矿公司”的产品的“最大买主”是美国国防部。当安德逊早先担任政府职务的时候（他过去做过海军部长，以后又担任过国防部副部长），这家公司和美国政府签订了出售大宗镍的合同。属于安德逊的镍公司，同与国务卿杜勒斯有关系的“国际镍公司”也密切勾结在一起。
    薛尔兹最后强调指出，作为国家安全委员会的委员，安德逊将参与决定使用核武器以及其他大规模杀人武器的问题。
