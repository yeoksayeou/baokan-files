The Baghdad Pact Organization

The Baghdad Pact Organization is an aggressive military bloc cobbled together by Britain and the United States in the Middle East. Its purpose is to attempt to split the unity of Arab countries, suppress anti-colonialist movements in the Middle East, and use the treaty member states as bases and sources of troops to prepare for launching wars of aggression against socialist countries. The Baghdad Pact Organization is also used as an intermediate link connecting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

British and American imperialists had long wanted to organize an aggressive military bloc in the strategically important Middle East region. They had previously formulated plans such as the so-called "Middle East Command," "Middle East Defense Board," and "Middle East Defense Organization." These plans were bankrupt due to widespread opposition from Middle Eastern countries. Afterward, the United States adopted a roundabout strategy, first inducing Middle Eastern countries to sign a series of bilateral military agreements to form the so-called "Northern Tier" alliance. In April 1954, Turkey and Pakistan signed a military and economic cooperation agreement. In the same year, the United States signed military agreements with Pakistan and Iraq, respectively.

Great Britain, seeing its influence in the Middle East being constantly squeezed out, instigated Iraq, which was under its control, to sign a "Mutual Cooperation Pact" with Turkey in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, in February 1955, namely the Baghdad Pact. Based on this, Britain and Iraq signed a special agreement stipulating that Britain would train and equip the Iraqi army and maintain and use Iraqi airports and other facilities. In the event of a "threat of armed attack" against Iraq, as deemed by both parties, Britain would provide assistance, including dispatching armed forces. Iraq would then need to "provide all facilities and assistance" for this.

The Baghdad Pact stipulated that a standing council should be established when at least four countries participated. Subsequently, Britain joined the treaty in April 1955, and Pakistan and Iran also joined in September and October of the same year. In November 1955, the five member states of the treaty held their first Council meeting in Baghdad, formally establishing the Baghdad Pact Organization. The highest body of this organization is the Standing Ministerial Council. The Council has a Secretariat, a Military Committee, and an Economic Committee. The second Council meeting in April 1956 also established a spy organization, the "Anti-Subversion Committee."

The United States sent observers to attend the first meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization Council and decided to send permanent representatives to maintain regular political and military contact between the organization and the United States. At the second meeting, the United States decided to participate in the Economic Committee and the "Anti-Subversion Committee" and established a military liaison group at the treaty headquarters. In this way, the United States has actually joined the treaty. However, because this aggressive military bloc has been fiercely opposed by the people of the Middle East and many Arab countries and has been notorious, the United States has always avoided becoming a formal member in order to conceal its colonialist face.

Britain directly instigated and participated in the Baghdad Pact in order to use this treaty organization as a tool to maintain its colonial power in the Middle East. However, Britain's colonialist policy has suffered increasing failures, and its position in the Middle East has been weakened. Last November, the four Muslim member states of the treaty actually held two meetings without Britain. The meetings expressed regret over the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and greatly praised the United States' policy in the Middle East. In January of this year, the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine," openly declaring that it would fill the "vacuum" left by Britain and France. Although Britain was extremely dissatisfied with this offensive by the United States, it desperately needed the support of the United States to maintain its remaining colonial interests. In the communique of the Anglo-American Bermuda talks held in March of this year, the United States announced its participation in the work of the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. At this session of the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, the U.S. representative attended the Military Committee meeting. Control of the Baghdad Pact Organization is increasingly falling into the hands of the United States. (Right)

    巴格达条约组织
    巴格达条约组织是英美在中东拼凑的侵略性的军事集团，其目的是企图分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，镇压中东的反殖民主义运动，并以条约成员国为基地和兵力来源，为发动侵略社会主义国家的战争作准备。巴格达条约组织还被作为衔接北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织的中间环节。
    英、美帝国主义很早就想在具有战略意义的中东地区组织侵略性的军事集团，它们曾经拟订过所谓“中东司令部”、“中东防务委员会”和“中东防御组织”等计划。这些计划由于受到中东国家普遍的反对，都遭到破产。之后，美国便采取迂回的策略，首先诱使中东国家之间签订一系列的双边军事协定，组成所谓“北层”联盟。1954年4月，土耳其和巴基斯坦签订了军事和经济合作协定。同年，美国又同巴基斯坦和伊拉克分别签订了军事协定。
    英国鉴于自己在中东的势力不断受到排挤，便于1955年2月策动在它控制下的伊拉克同土耳其在伊拉克首都巴格达签订了一个“互助合作公约”，即巴格达条约。英国并同伊拉克据此而签订了一个特别协定，规定由英国训练和装备伊拉克的军队，维持和使用伊拉克的机场和其他设备。遇有双方认为对伊拉克的“武装攻击的威胁”时，英国应予以援助，包括出动武装部队。伊拉克则需为此“提供一切便利和协助”。
    巴格达条约规定在至少有四个国家参加时，即应设立常设理事会。此后，英国于1955年4月参加了这个条约，巴基斯坦和伊朗也相继于同年9月和10月加入。1955年11月，条约的五个成员国在巴格达举行了第一次理事会会议，正式成立了巴格达条约组织。这个组织以常设部长理事会为最高机构。理事会下设秘书处、军事委员会和经济委员会。1956年4月第二次理事会会议，还成立了间谍组织“反颠覆委员会”。
    美国在巴格达条约组织理事会举行第一次会议时，就曾派观察员出席，并决定派遣常驻代表，使这个组织同美国在政治和军事上经常保持联系。在举行第二次会议时，美国又决定参加了经济委员会和“反颠覆委员会”，并在条约总部设立一个军事联络组。这样，美国实际上已参加了这个条约。但是，由于这个侵略性的军事集团遭到中东各国人民和许多阿拉伯国家的激烈反对，而声名狼籍，美国为了隐蔽自己的殖民主义面目，一直避免成为正式的成员国。
    英国直接策动和参加了巴格达条约，是为了想把这个条约组织作为保持中东殖民势力的工具。但是，英国的殖民主义政策已经遭到越来越大的失败，它在中东的地位日益削弱。去年11月间，条约的四个穆斯林成员国竟甩开英国举行了两次会议。会议对英法侵略埃及表示遗憾，而对美国在中东的政策则大为赞扬。今年1月，美国提出“艾森豪威尔主义”，公然宣布要填补英法的“真空”。英国对美国的这种进攻，虽极为不满，但又无可奈何地急需美国的支持，以维持它残存的殖民利益。在今年3月举行的英美百慕大会谈的公报中，美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会的工作。在这一届巴格达条约理事会会议上，美国代表出席了军事委员会会议。巴格达条约组织的控制权，正一天天旁落到美国的手里。　（右）
