After announcing that it would ship missiles to Taiwan, the American aggressor is planning to equip American troops stationed in South Korea and the Syngman Rhee army with atomic weapons, missiles, and other new types of weapons. U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson publicly stated on May 14 that the United States intends to ship weapons capable of launching nuclear warheads to South Korea. Dulles also said at a press conference on the same day that the United States is considering shipping "more modern and more effective" weapons to South Korea. Following this, the 27th Division of the Syngman Rhee army held a so-called "mobile atomic warfare exercise" near the Korean western armistice line. These facts show that the U.S. government is attempting to completely overturn the Korean Armistice Agreement it signed and provoke new threats of war and tensions in Korea.

In order to cover up its actions to undermine the armistice agreement, the United States is trying to find excuses. Dulles said that the Korean Armistice Agreement "was concluded almost five years ago, and it was expected to be implemented for only a short period of time, and stipulated that weapons could only be replaced on a performance-equivalent and one-to-one basis; and now, after those five years, many of the weapons that were originally there are no longer in production and are obsolete. Therefore, it is impractical to replace weapons on exactly the same basis, and there must be some flexibility here." However, Dulles is playing a trick here, and he cannot answer why the United States must stay in South Korea for a long time, why the United States refuses the proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea by withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, and why, before foreign troops withdraw from Korea, the weapons of both sides cannot be maintained at the level at the time of the armistice? Dulles did not talk about these, and insisted on creating some excuses to try to cover up his actions to undermine the armistice agreement, which is not going to work.

Dulles knew that his reasons were insufficient, so he had to resort to the old propaganda tricks. He said: "We have ample evidence that the Chinese Communist side is shipping weapons and aircraft to this area on a basis that cannot be considered strictly or reasonably in compliance with the armistice agreement. Under these conditions, we are considering shipping more modern and more effective weapons into the Republic of Korea ourselves." Of course, if Dulles could really produce any "evidence," everyone would be interested in seeing it, but he can't produce anything! If, as Dulles said, the Korean and Chinese sides shipped in weapons and aircraft, then why doesn't Dulles ask the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate? Why do the Korean and Chinese sides firmly advocate that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams stay at the ports of both the North and the South, while the U.S. side insists on driving them away?

The facts, of course, cannot be covered up by Dulles' rhetoric. It is well known that the United States and the Syngman Rhee group have used all means to undermine the armistice agreement for three years and ten months since the armistice. The United States and the Syngman Rhee group signed the "Mutual Defense Treaty," refused to comply with the provisions of the unanimous resolutions of the four member states of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, illegally shipped in reinforcements of weapons, and expanded the Syngman Rhee army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. The United States and the Syngman Rhee group carried out a large number of serious provocations in the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. In the three years after the armistice, U.S. aircraft flew over the military control area of the Korean and Chinese sides in 513 batches, 1,072 sorties, several of which penetrated deep into the rear of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to carry out provocations. The United States used various means to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which supervised the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, persecuted the personnel of the commission, and twice instigated thugs to attack the personnel of the commission. Finally, in order to evade the commission's inspection of the U.S. side's smuggling of reinforcements of weapons, the U.S. side, ignoring the protests of the Korean and Chinese sides, unilaterally stopped the work of the commission's inspection teams at various specific ports in South Korea on June 9, 1956, in an attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the world. In order to prepare to re-launch the war and create tensions, the United States has been opposing the withdrawal of its troops from Korea, rejecting all reasonable political solutions proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides and the neutral countries, and insisting on letting the United Nations, as one of the belligerent parties, "supervise" the Korean elections. The United States is using such an absurd proposition to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and delay the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea.

The record of three years and ten months thoroughly exposes the U.S. intentions in Korea. It is only because the Korean and Chinese sides have taken a firm stand to maintain the armistice agreement in response to every provocative act by the U.S. side that the U.S. side has not dared to rashly launch further provocations. But there is no doubt that every action of the U.S. side that violates the armistice agreement has caused tensions in Korea, made the Korean armistice long-term unstable, and made the threat of war recurrence constant. This time, the United States' intention to ship atomic weapons to South Korea is a more blatant provocation to peace in Korea and the Far East.

For the Korean and Chinese people, it is not news that the American aggressors have atomic weapons. Although the Korean and Chinese sides have maintained and are maintaining the armistice agreement, and still advocate a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, if the U.S. side insists on provoking the Korean and Chinese sides, the Korean and Chinese sides will not sit idly by. The threat of war cannot scare the Korean and Chinese people.

The ones who will suffer from this U.S. approach will be those so-called "allies" of the United States who are still tied to the Korean war chariot by the United States. Although they are dissatisfied with the U.S. approach, they have taken an appeasement attitude towards the blackmail of the United States and the Syngman Rhee group, trying to exchange concessions for the United States and the Syngman Rhee group not to "cause trouble." As a result, they cannot but acquiesce to the fait accompli of the United States acting arbitrarily, and let the United States lead them by the nose again and again.

At the 11th United Nations General Assembly, some allies of the United States accused the United States of being too rigid in its attitude towards solving the Korean issue and believed that the integrity of the armistice agreement should be maintained. As a result, Dulles had to say at a press conference on April 2: "We do not approve of regarding the entire armistice agreement as invalid and in fact restoring the actual state of war." But this is a lie by Dulles, because the ultimate goal of undermining one of the most important clauses of the armistice agreement—the prohibition of shipping reinforcements of weapons into Korea—is to make "the entire armistice agreement invalid and in fact restore the actual state of war." The United States is now trying to ship new weapons into South Korea before the next session of the United Nations General Assembly convenes, so as to put the fait accompli in front of the United Nations. Wilson is already saying that the United States is "notifying" its sixteen "allies" of this serious U.S. decision to undermine the armistice agreement. Therefore, in the coming period, the people of these countries will see whether their governments fulfill what they said at the General Assembly and thus oppose the U.S. adventure; or once again succumb to U.S. pressure and thus have to bear part of the responsibility for undermining the armistice agreement and creating tensions in the Far East.

Now is the time for relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the solution of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves. The U.S. approach of shipping atomic weapons or other new types of weapons into South Korea can only make the solution of the Korean issue more complicated and more difficult. The United States must immediately stop this action. If it insists on doing so, it can only prove that it is determined to make the Korean issue unsolvable and attempts to destroy the entire Korean nation. Because the result of conducting an atomic war in Korea will first affect the Korean people, which will not only be opposed by the people of North Korea, but also by the people of South Korea. The rule of the Syngman Rhee group and the reckless behavior of the U.S. military in Korea have aroused widespread opposition among the Korean people. The sentiments expressed by the South Korean people in various ways in opposition to the Syngman Rhee group in the South Korean "presidential" election in May last year were a signal. The hatred and anger expressed by the South Korean people in April this year towards the large-scale looting and atrocities committed by the U.S. military in South Korea is another signal. The United States and the Syngman Rhee group are actually sitting on the volcano of the Korean people's anger. The shipment of atomic weapons into South Korea cannot subdue the South Korean people; it will only make this volcano erupt faster.

    美国在朝鲜制造新的紧张局势
    金谊
    美国侵略者宣布要把导弹运进台湾之后，又在计划用原子武器、导弹和其他新型武器装备驻在南朝鲜的美国侵略军和李承晚军队。美国国防部长威尔逊5月14日公开表示，美国打算将能发射原子弹头的武器运往南朝鲜。杜勒斯同一天也在记者招待会上说，美国正在考虑把“更加新式、更加有效”的武器运入南朝鲜。接着，李承晚军队第二十七师在朝鲜西部停战线附近举行了所谓“机动原子战演习”。这些事实表明，美国政府正在企图彻底推翻它自己签字的朝鲜停战协定，在朝鲜挑起新的战争威胁和紧张局势。
    美国为了掩盖它破坏停战协定的行为，正在想方设法制造借口。杜勒斯说，朝鲜停战协定“是在将近五年以前缔结的，当时预期只实行一个短时期，并且规定只有在性能相当和一对一的基础上才能替换武器；而现在经过那五年以后，本来在那里的许多武器现在已经不再生产了，已经陈旧不用了。因此，完全在相同的基础上替换武器是不实际的，这里必须有一定的弹性。”但是，杜勒斯在这里玩了一个花招，他回答不出为什么美国必须长期呆在南朝鲜，为什么美国要拒绝朝中方面所建议的召开有关国家会议来讨论从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和平统一朝鲜问题，为什么在外国军队撤出朝鲜以前双方的武器不能保持在停战时的水平上？杜勒斯不谈这些，硬制造出一些借口来企图掩盖自己破坏停战协定的行为，这是行不通的。
    杜勒斯自知理由不充分，所以他不得不搬出老一套的宣传伎俩了，他说：“我们有充分的证据可以证明中国共产党那方面正在完全不能算是严格或合理地遵守停战协定的基础上运送武器和飞机到这一地区去。在这些条件下，我们正在考虑我们自己也把更加新式、更加有效的武器运入大韩民国。”当然，如果杜勒斯真的能拿出什么“证据”来，大家都会有兴趣看一看的，可是他什么也拿不出来！如果真像杜勒斯所说的，朝中方面运进了武器和飞机，那末，杜勒斯为什么不要求中立国监察委员会进行调查呢？为什么朝中方面坚决主张中立国监察委员会视察小组留在南北双方口岸，而美国方面硬要把它们赶走呢？
    事实当然不是杜勒斯的花言巧语所能掩盖的。停战三年十个月以来，美国和李承晚集团用尽一切手段破坏停战协定，这是人所共知共见的。美国同李承晚集团订立了“共同防御条约”，拒不遵守中立国监察委员会四国委员一致决议的各项规定，非法运进增援的武器，把李承晚军队从停战时的十六个师，扩充为三十一个师。美国同李承晚集团在军事分界线和非军事区进行了大量的严重的挑衅。在停战后三年中，美国飞机飞越朝中方面军事控制地区即达五百一十三批，一千零七十二架次，其中有数次还深入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国后方进行挑衅。美国用各种手段破坏监督朝鲜停战协定实施的中立国监察委员会的工作，对委员会人员施加迫害，两次发动暴徒向委员会的工作人员进行攻击。最后为了逃避委员会对于美方偷运增援的武器进行视察，美方竟不顾朝中方面的抗议，于1956年6月9日片面地停止委员会的视察小组在南朝鲜各特定口岸的工作，企图一手遮尽天下人耳目。美国为准备重新发动战争和制造紧张局势，一直反对从朝鲜撤出它的军队，拒绝朝中方面和中立国所提出的一切合理的政治解决办法，而坚持要让作为交战一方的联合国来“监督”朝鲜选举。美国就是用这样一种荒谬透顶的主张来阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，拖延它的军队撤出南朝鲜。
    三年十个月的记录，彻底揭露美国在朝鲜的意图。仅仅由于朝中方面对于美方每一次挑衅行为采取严正的维护停战协定的立场，才使美方不敢贸然发动进一步的挑衅。但是毫无疑问，美方的每一次违反停战协定的行为，都引起了朝鲜的紧张局势，使朝鲜停战长期不能稳定，使战争复发的威胁经常存在。这一次美国要把原子武器运进南朝鲜，乃是对朝鲜和远东和平的更露骨的挑衅。
    对于朝中人民来说，美国侵略者有原子武器已经不是什么新闻。朝中方面虽然过去和现在都要维护停战协定，仍然主张和平解决朝鲜问题和从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，但是如果美国方面硬要向朝中方面挑衅，朝中方面是不会坐视不理的。战争威胁并不能吓倒朝中人民。
    美国这种作法，倒楣的将是到现在还被美国缚在朝鲜战车上的那些美国的所谓“盟国”。他们虽然对于美国的做法心怀不满，但是由于他们对美国和李承晚集团的讹诈采取姑息态度，想以让步来换取美国和李承晚集团不要“闯祸”，结果他们就不能不默认美国独断独行的既成事实，一次又一次地让美国牵着鼻子走。
    在十一届联合国大会上，美国的某些盟国曾指责美国对于解决朝鲜问题的态度太僵硬，认为应该保持停战协定的完整。于是，杜勒斯不得不在4月2日记者招待会上表示：“把整个停战协定视为无效并且在事实上恢复实际的交战状态而论，这是我们所不赞成的”。但这是杜勒斯的谎言，因为破坏停战协定最重要的条款之一——禁止增援的武器运入朝鲜——的最终目的在于使“整个停战协定视为无效并且在事实上恢复实际的交战状态”。美国现在正企图在下届联合国大会开会前把新式武器运进南朝鲜，以便把既成事实放在联合国的面前。威尔逊已经在说，美国正在把美国这一严重的破坏停战协定的决定“通知”它的十六个“盟国”。因此，在今后一个时期内，这些国家的人民将会看到，究竟他们的政府是履行它们在联大所说过的话，因而反对美国的冒险行为呢；还是再一次屈从于美国的压力，从而必须担负起破坏停战协定，造成远东紧张局势的一部分责任。
    现在已经是有关国家来讨论一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、朝鲜问题由朝鲜人自己解决的时候了。美国把原子武器或其他新型武器运进南朝鲜的做法，只能使朝鲜问题的解决更加复杂和更加困难。美国必须立即停止这一行动。如果它硬要这样做，那就只能证明它决心使朝鲜问题不能解决并企图毁灭整个朝鲜民族。因为在朝鲜进行一场原子战争的结果，首先遭殃的是朝鲜人民，这不但将为朝鲜北部人民所反对，而且也将为朝鲜南部人民所反对。李承晚集团的统治和美军在朝鲜的胡作非为，已经在朝鲜人民中间引起广泛的反对。去年5月南朝鲜“总统”选举中，南朝鲜人民以各种方式所表示出来的反对李承晚集团的情绪是一次信号。今年4月间南朝鲜人民对于美军在南朝鲜进行大规模抢劫和暴行所表示出来的憎恨和忿怒，这又是一次信号。美国和李承晚集团实际上是坐在朝鲜人民忿怒的火山口上，原子武器的运入南朝鲜决不能压服南朝鲜人民，它只会使这个火山口更快的爆发。
