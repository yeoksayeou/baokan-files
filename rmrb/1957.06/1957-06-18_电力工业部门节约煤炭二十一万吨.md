The electricity industry sector saved 210,000 tons of coal.

(Our newspaper reports) The state-owned power plants across the country generated a total of 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity from January to May this year, an increase of 21% compared to the same period last year. Each power grid with hydroelectric plants has strengthened its economic dispatch work this year. By the end of May, hydroelectric power plants nationwide had generated more than 170 million kilowatt-hours of electricity above the plan. This has reduced the consumption of fuel coal by thermal power plants by 130,000 tons.

The employees of local electric power bureaus and power plants have actively worked to reduce the plant's own power consumption rate and line loss rate by improving the management of plant power consumption, increasing the operating efficiency of auxiliary equipment for machines and furnaces, and improving the management of power systems in this year's production increase and economy practice campaign. From January to May of this year, these two indicators decreased month by month compared to the plan, saving a total of more than 79 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. The reduction in these electricity consumption figures is equivalent to saving the country 60,000 tons of coal. State-owned thermal power plants have also made great efforts to reduce coal consumption rates. Except for May, when the coal consumption rate target was not met, more than 20,000 tons of coal have been saved for the country from January to April.

Due to increased hydropower generation and the reduction of various technical and economic indicators, the power industry production system has saved the country 210,000 tons of coal in the first five months of this year.

　　电力工业部门节约煤炭二十一万吨
    本报讯　全国国营发电厂今年1至5月共生产电力六十亿度，比去年同一时期增加了21％的生产量。各个有水电厂的电力网，今年加强了经济调度工作，到5月底止，全国水力发电厂比计划多发了一亿七千多万度电力。这样便使火力发电厂减少了十三万吨燃煤的消耗。
    各地电业局和发电厂的职工，在今年的增产节约运动中，积极从改善厂用电的管理、提高机炉附属设备的运行效率和改善电力系统管理工作等方面着手，降低了厂用电率和线路损失率。今年1至5月份，这两项指标逐月比计划有所降低，共节约电力七千九百多万度。这些电力消耗的减少，折合起来给国家节省燃煤六万吨。国营火力发电厂在降低煤耗率方面也作了很多努力。除5月份没有完成煤耗率指标以外，1至4月份已经给国家节约了二万多吨燃煤。
    由于多发水电和降低各种技术经济指标，今年前五个月，电力工业生产系统已经给国家节约了二十一万吨煤炭。
