    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from London: Labour Party MP George Brown, upon returning to London after a six-week visit to the United States, said that the American people universally hope for world disarmament and peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union. Brown is the main spokesperson for the opposition party's defense policy in the British House of Commons. During his visit to the United States, he toured defense facilities and studied defense plans, including the missile forward base at White Sands and the atomic research station at Oak Ridge.

    He said at London Airport on May 31, "The extent of the American military effort is quite astonishing." However, after talking with people from all walks of life in the United States, he concluded: "The American people are very keen to make some arrangements to ease world tensions and put us on the path to effective disarmament." He said, "The people want peace, but among some officials, I did see very obvious concerns about disarmament." He believes, "This is because they don't trust the Russians." He also believes that Eisenhower is in favor of disarmament.

    Brown also said that he was not "entirely satisfied" with all defense arrangements between Britain and the United States. He will report on this issue to his party leader Gaitskell and colleagues.

    美国政府热中军备竞赛  美国人民普遍要求裁军
    英工党议员访美所见
    新华社2日讯　伦敦消息：工党议员乔治·布朗在美国访问了六个星期以后回到伦敦的时候说，美国人民普遍希望实现世界裁军并且同苏联共处。布朗是英国下院中反对党的国防政策主要发言人，他在美国参观了国防设施和研究了国防计划，其中包括在怀特桑兹的导弹前沿基地和在奥克列基的原子研究站。
    他5月31日在伦敦机场上说，“美国在军事上努力的程度是十分惊人的。但是，他同美国各界人士谈话以后得到的结论是：“美国人民十分希望作出某些安排，以便缓和世界紧张局势和使我们走上有效的裁军道路”。他说：“人民希望和平，但是，在某些官方人士中间，我的确看到，他们很明显地对裁军有顾虑”。他认为：“这是由于他们不相信俄国人。”他还认为，艾森豪威尔是赞成裁军的。
    布朗还说，他并不是对英美之间在国防方面的一切安排都是“十分满意的”。在这个问题上，他将向他的党的领袖盖次克尔和同事们作汇报。
