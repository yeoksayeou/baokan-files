What Hinders the Development of Inner Mongolia's Literary and Art Undertakings
By our reporter Lin Mo

    Many problems exist in Inner Mongolia's literary and art circles, seriously hindering the prosperity and development of the various ethnic groups' literature and art in the autonomous region. Because the leading departments are plagued by "three isms," these problems have not been resolved for a long time, and they are accumulating more and more.

    Last month, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a propaganda work conference, and this newspaper's Inner Mongolia reporter station and the Autonomous Region Cultural Bureau jointly held a symposium for literary and art circles. At these meetings, a large number of Inner Mongolia's literary and art problems were exposed.
        The Inner Mongolia Party Committee's Propaganda Department has serious bureaucratic and dogmatic tendencies in its leadership of literary and art work
    A large portion of the speeches criticized the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's Propaganda Department's leadership of literary and art work. Many people believe that the Propaganda Department has serious bureaucratic tendencies and leads literary and art work with simple administrative orders.

    Playwright Zhou Ge said: The leaders of the Propaganda Department usually do not study or understand the complex phenomena and problems in literary and art work. When things happen, they temporarily grab a handful and ask literary and art workers to cooperate with propaganda, viewing literary and art work as very simple. We hope that the Propaganda Department would have a minister who understands literature and art to lead literary and art work, but the leadership criticized us and said, "You all want the leadership to be like Mei Lanfang; in reality, you are opposing the leadership of the Party." Literary and art workers usually have a pessimistic and dissatisfied saying about the leadership: "Anyway, literary and art work won't kill anyone; it's just like that!" They don't care much about literary and art problems, but they sometimes keep a tight rein on the ideology of literary and art cadres, randomly labeling them with things like "anti-leadership, anti-Party," etc.

    Chen Qingzhang, who used to be the director of the literary and art section of the Propaganda Department for three years, said: The problems in Inner Mongolia's literary and art circles have existed for a long time in the past and have been continuously developing. This is because of many debates on literary and art issues, especially disagreements with the leadership's views on certain issues. Everyone has a one-sided view on the issues, and it is normal to have disputes, but they were not led to proper discussions of academic issues. Instead, they were often buried in personal feelings, and academic disputes were vulgarized. Moreover, disagreeing with the leadership's opinions was often considered anti-leadership. This contradiction developed to the point of the anti-rebellion campaign, and some internal contradictions were mistakenly regarded as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and they were rectified. This suppressed the problem, but in reality, the contradiction was not resolved, but deepened. Many people remained silent.

    Yin Shoushi, director of the Inner Mongolia Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: I believe that the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's Propaganda Department has dogmatic tendencies in its leadership of literary and art work, and this is the dominant aspect. The direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers is often understood as meaning only subject matter about workers, peasants, and soldiers, ignoring the breadth of subject matter. And some of our literary and art workers also have shortcomings, overemphasizing the particularity of literature and art. The leadership uses one-sidedness to oppose one-sidedness, and dogmatism to oppose dogmatism. If you offer too many opinions, you will be labeled as being detached from politics and anti-leadership. It is difficult for the leadership to listen to the different opinions of literary and art workers. This hinders independent thinking and free discussion on literary and art issues. I heard that the central government instructed all provinces and autonomous regions to discuss literary and art work once a year. I also made such a suggestion to the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, but it has never been done. The Party Committee's Propaganda Department usually interferes little in literary and art circles, so of course there are many problems. When there are problems, they temporarily grab a handful and rectify things. How can this be done well? Of course, we do not necessarily require the leading comrades of the Propaganda Department to be proficient in literature and art, but can they have more contact, learn more, and talk to literary and art cadres? Unfortunately, such things are rare. Without understanding and concern, how can they lead? They can only lead with dogmatism and treat literary and art cadres with bureaucracy.
      Some young authors not only do not receive
  cultivation and help from the leadership, but sometimes
  suffer serious blows and devastation
    Ulan Ba Gan, a young Mongolian writer, said: In Inner Mongolia, some young authors not only do not receive cultivation and help from the leadership, but sometimes suffer serious blows and devastation. For the past seven or eight years, I have been engaged in creation in my spare time, working during the day and writing at night, sleeping only four or five hours a day, and I wrote a full-length novel of 1.2 million words, "Beacon Fire on the Grassland." Why did I write it? In the past, our parents used the method of praying to gods and worshiping Buddha to find happiness, kowtowing every step of the way, kowtowing for decades to Wutai Mountain; our ancestors also held many armed resistances to resist the oppression of foreign races, shedding all their blood. But those who went to Wutai Mountain did not find paradise, and the many resistances also failed because there was no leadership from the Communist Party. After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao gave us happiness and strength. Our nation has undergone historical changes. I love my hometown, the grassland, and the people even more. I feel that I should reflect this great change. The conscience of a Mongolian prompted me to write. But in the process of writing, I was often criticized and struggled against, saying that I was individualistic and had a pursuit of fame and gain; my desk and lamp were confiscated, and there were difficulties in all aspects. In the end, it developed to the point where even my manuscript was to be confiscated, and the characters I wrote were crying out injustice in the piles of paper. I suffered a nervous breakdown for more than a month because of this. The person who attacked me was Comrade Zhou Dali, who used to be the deputy editor-in-chief of the eastern edition of the Inner Mongolia Daily. I think he has serious Han chauvinist ideas, thinking that Mongolians are backward and not believing that they can write anything, so I am not the only Mongolian youth who has been attacked by him. He does not understand literary creation and the role of literature and art. He said that novels are made up. He thinks that I am not doing my job properly by writing at night, and even suspects that I am doing bad things, and sends people to monitor me. Although I have suffered great mental stimulation, and my body was also very bad for a period of time, I have not been discouraged and have always worn my conscience as an iron hat on my head, insisting on writing. Finally, I received the support and help of the National Writers Association and the leaders of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, so that I can concentrate on literary work. But I feel that in this rectification campaign, comrades with incorrect thinking and work styles like Zhou Dali should be given the necessary education in the spirit of unity, criticism, and unity.

    At the meeting, many people criticized the high walls between Party members and non-Party members, and between leaders and those being led, within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Writers Association, and the Fine Arts Association; individual leaders were dictatorial and lacked democracy; in literary and artistic works, they used improper means to elevate themselves and suppress others; among literary and art workers, they bullied the old and deceived the new; between the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Cultural Bureau, because of the abnormal relationship between individual leaders, departments formed their own factions, and on many issues, they did not work together in unity, but excluded each other.

    The two non-Party vice-chairmen of the Writers Association have the title but no power, and Vice-Chairman Na. Saiyin Chaoketu's words don't carry weight, and he can't even order a messenger around. He is an ethnic writer, but he has been assigned to editing and translation work, making it difficult for him to engage in ethnic literature research and creation.
      Inner Mongolia's literary and art circles must prosper in creation, let a hundred flowers bloom, rectify the ranks, and unite new and old literary and art workers
    Yang Ping, the leader of the editorial team of the literary and art journal "Grassland," said that individual leaders of the Writers Association claim to promote creative prosperity, but they canceled the creation room and ruined the creative conditions of others, while they themselves create behind closed doors. They do not allow other people's full-length novels to be published in "Grassland," but their own can be published. Comrade An Mi used to write many poems in the creation room, but now that the creation room has been canceled, he can only write in his spare time, which is restricted. Yang Ping believes that Inner Mongolia's literary and art circles must prosper in creation, let a hundred flowers bloom, rectify the ranks, unite new and old literary and art workers, establish collective leadership in literary and art organizations, eliminate the bad habits of a few people controlling everything, develop a democratic atmosphere of criticism and free discussion, and open up publishing gardens, otherwise, fresh air from the outside will not be able to come in.

    Art worker Wuen said: In the past, I was attacked because I criticized bureaucracy. As long as things are detrimental to the Party and the people, I will fight them. Because of this, I am disliked by some leaders. Some people joined the Party confusedly. I do not recognize some Party members because they are not as enthusiastic and brave as non-Party comrades on many issues. Individual leaders of the Fine Arts Association lack democracy, are dictatorial in everything, and put great pressure on everyone. Many people are dissatisfied but dare not talk about it. Everyone was unwilling to paint for the art exhibition held for the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region and remained silent to show their resistance. Those with a high level of theoretical knowledge in the art world are criticized, and those who paint well are transferred to other places, which is very detrimental to the prosperity of the art cause. Some leaders have Han chauvinist ideas and exclude ethnic cadres. When the Fine Arts Association was established, there was initially no Chaolu (Mongolian). Later, when the matter reached the central government, Chaolu became the deputy director.

    Some comrades have remnants of Han chauvinism, and rarely consider issues from the perspective of ethnic groups in literary and art cadres and literary and art activities
    Zhou Ge said: One of the ideological roots of disunity in literary and art circles is that some of our comrades have remnants of Han chauvinism, and rarely consider issues from the perspective of ethnic groups in literary and art cadres and literary and art activities. Take making friends, for example. After working in the autonomous region for ten years, one should have a Mongolian confidant friend, but this cannot be said among some of our leading comrades. They talk about unity in words, but when doing things, they only focus on the majority of Han people in the autonomous region, and of course, they ignore ethnic characteristics. At the same time, in the depths of the hearts of some Han cadres, there is always a sense of disdain and contempt for ethnic cadres. For example, the art studio is led by the Cultural Bureau, and some comrades in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles feel that who can lead them? Aren't they just looking to the Federation of Literary and Art Circles! For example, when the Cultural Bureau conducts literary and art awards, they also say coldly behind their backs: "Let them evaluate, anyway, they have money and nowhere to spend it!" This makes some ethnic cadres feel disgusted and exclusive, squeezing out some Han cadres who are not easy to lead. But the responsibility lies with us because you don't help well, forcing people to do this. Comrade Bu He, Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau, often considers issues from the perspective of ethnic groups, but many things also lack consultation, so personal relationships cause friction between departments. In work, they restrain each other instead of helping each other.

### 是什么阻碍着内蒙古文艺事业的发展

    是什么阻碍着内蒙古文艺事业的发展
    本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古文艺界存在着许多问题，严重地阻碍着自治区内各民族文艺的繁荣和发展。由于领导部门有“三个主义”在作怪，使这些问题长期得不到解决，而且愈堆愈多。
    在上个月，中共内蒙古自治区委员会召开了宣传工作会议，本报驻内蒙古记者站和自治区文化局又联合召开了文艺界座谈会，在这些会上，内蒙古文艺界的问题得到大量的揭发。
        内蒙古党委宣传部对文艺
  工作的领导有严重的官僚主义
  和教条主义
    发言的很大一部分是批评内蒙古党委宣传部对文艺工作的领导的，许多人认为宣传部有严重的官僚主义，以简单的行政命令的方式领导文艺工作。
    剧作者周戈说：宣传部领导上平时对文艺工作中的复杂现象和问题，不去进行研究和了解，遇事就临时抓一把，要文艺工作者配合宣传，把文艺工作看得十分简单。我们希望宣传部最好有一个懂得文艺的部长领导文艺工作，于是领导上就批评说：“你们都要求领导上像梅兰芳那样，实际上就是反对党的领导。”文艺工作者平时有句对领导消极不满的话：“反正文艺工作上死不了人，就是那么回事儿！”对文艺问题不大管，但对文艺干部的思想有时却扣得很紧，遇上问题就乱扣帽子，什么“反领导，反党”等等。
    曾在宣传部当过三年文艺处处长的陈清漳说：内蒙古文艺界的问题过去曾长期存在着，不断发展，这就是对文艺问题的许多争论，特别是和领导上对某些问题的看法不一致。对问题的看法各有片面性，有争论是正常的，但却没有引向学术问题好好探讨，往往被湮没在个人之间的意气中，把学术争论庸俗化了，而且不同意领导上的意见，往往就被认为是反领导。这个矛盾发展到肃反，有的就把内部矛盾错认为敌我矛盾，挨了整。这样把问题压了一下，但实际上矛盾并没有解决，而是更深了，不少人沉默不语了。
    内蒙古文联主任尹瘦石说：我认为内蒙古党委宣传部对文艺工作的领导有教条主义，而且是占主要地位的。把为工农兵服务的方向往往理解为工农兵题材，忽视了题材的广泛性。而我们某些文艺工作者也有缺点，过多地强调文艺的特殊性。领导上以片面性来反对片面性、以教条主义反对教条主义，你意见提得多一点，就扣你个帽子，脱离政治，反领导。领导上对文艺工作者的不同意见，是很难听进去的。这就妨碍了对文艺问题的独立思考和自由讨论。听说中央曾指示各省和自治区一年要讨论一次文艺工作，我也曾向内蒙古党委作过这样的建议，但始终未这样作过。党委宣传部平常对文艺界过问少，问题当然就很多。有了问题，就临时抓一把，整一下，这样怎么能搞好呢？当然我们不一定要求宣传部的领导同志精通文艺，但是否可以多接触，多了解，找文艺干部谈谈，可惜这样的事也是很少的。不了解，不关心，如何领导？就只有以教条主义来领导，以官僚主义对待文艺干部。
      有些青年作者不但得不到
  领导上的培养和帮助，有时反
  而遭到严重的打击和摧残
    蒙古族青年作家乌兰巴干说：在内蒙古有些青年作者，不但得不到领导上的培养和帮助，有时反而遭到严重的打击和摧残。过去七、八年，我一直是在业余搞创作，白天工作，夜里写文章，每天只睡四、五小时，写出了一部一百二十万字的长篇小说“草原烽火”。我为什么要写它呢？过去我们的爹娘用求神拜佛的办法找幸福，一步磕一个头，磕几十年到五台山去；我们的祖先为反抗异族的压迫，也举行过多次的武装反抗，流尽了鲜血。但是到五台山的也没找到天堂，多次的反抗也都因为没有共产党的领导而失败了。解放了，共产党、毛主席给了我们幸福，给了我以力量，我们的民族发生了历史性的大变化，我更加热爱自己的家乡、草原和人民，我觉得应该反映这个大变化，一个蒙古人的良心促使我去写作。但在写作过程中，经常受批评，挨斗争，说我是个人主义，名利观点；没收我的桌子和灯，各方面为难，最后发展到甚至要没收我的稿子，罪及作品，使我所写的人物在纸堆中喊冤。我为此事曾经神经失常一个多月。打击我的就是曾经在内蒙古日报东部版担任副总编辑的周达理同志。我觉得他有严重的大汉族主义思想，认为蒙古人落后，不相信他们会写出东西，所以受他打击的蒙古青年不只我一个。他不理解文艺创作和文艺的作用，他说小说是瞎编的。他认为我每天夜里写东西是不干正事，甚至怀疑我是作坏事，派人监视我。我虽然精神上受到了很大的刺激，有一个时期身体也很不好了，但我并没有灰心丧气，一直把良心当作铁帽子顶在头上，坚持写作。最后终于得到全国作家协会和内蒙古党委领导上的支持和帮助，使我能够安心地从事文学事业。不过我觉得在这次整风中，对于像周达理这样思想作风不正的同志，应该本着团结、批评和团结的精神，给以应有的教育。
    在会上，很多人都批评文联、作协、美协内部党与非党之间、领导与被领导之间有高墙；个别领导人独断专行，缺乏民主，在文学、艺术作品上，用不正当的手段抬高自己，压倒别人；在文艺工作者之间，排老欺新；在文联和文化局之间，由于个别领导人关系不正常，使部门之间形成门户之见，在很多问题上，不是团结共事，而是互相排斥。
    作协的两个非党员副主席有职无权，副主席纳·赛音朝克图说话不顶事，连勤务员都支使不了。他是一个民族作家，但却被分配作编辑和翻译工作，使他很难从事于民族文学的研究和创作。
      内蒙古文艺界要繁荣创作，百花齐放，必须整顿队伍，团结新老文艺工作者
    文艺刊物“草原”的编辑组长杨平说，作协的个别领导人口称繁荣创作，但却把创作室取消，搞光了别人的创作条件，自己则是关门创作。对别人的长篇小说，不让在“草原”上刊登，而自己的就可以登。安谧同志过去在创作室写了不少诗，现在创作室取消，他只能利用业余时间写作，受到了限制。杨平认为，内蒙古文艺界要繁荣创作，百花齐放，必须整顿队伍，团结新老文艺工作者，文艺团体要建立集体领导，消除少数人操纵一切的坏习气，开展民主批评和自由讨论的风气，同时还要开辟出版园地，不然，外边的一些新鲜空气就吸收不进来。
    美术工作者乌恩说：过去由于我批评了官僚主义，就受到打击。只要对党和人民不利的事情，我就要斗争，正因为这样，受到某些领导人的厌恶。有的人是糊里糊涂入党的，我对有的党员是不承认的，因为他们在很多问题上还不如非党同志热情和勇敢。美协的个别领导人缺乏民主，遇事独断专行，对大家有很大的压力，很多人心里不满意，不敢谈，自治区成立十周年举行美术展览会，大家不愿画，沉默以示抗拒。美术界理论水平高的被批评，画得好的外调，很不利于美术事业的繁荣。有的领导人存在着大汉族主义思想，排斥民族干部。美协成立时，最初没有朝鲁（蒙古族），后来事情闹到中央，朝鲁才当了副主任。
    有些同志有大汉族主义思想的残余，对文艺干部、文艺活动很少从民族角度考虑问题
    周戈说：文艺界不团结，思想根源之一，是我们有些同志有大汉族主义思想的残余在作怪，对文艺干部、文艺活动很少从民族角度考虑问题。就说交朋友吧，在自治区工作十年，应该有个蒙古知心朋友，但这在我们一些领导同志之间却说不上。口头上讲团结，但办事情只从自治区的大多数汉人着眼，当然就忽视了民族特点。同时，在有些汉族干部的内心深处，对民族干部总有些轻视和瞧不起的心理。如美术工作室归文化局领导，文联有些同志就觉得，他们有谁能领导？还不是望着文联呵！如文化局进行文艺评奖，也在背后冷言冷语说：“他们评就评吧，反正是有钱无处花么！”这就使有些民族干部产生反感和排挤心理，把一些不好领导的汉族干部排挤出去。但责在我们，因为你不好好帮助，逼得人这样作。文化局副局长布赫同志常从民族角度考虑问题，但很多事也缺乏商量，因此由人的关系又造成部门之间的磨擦，在工作上是互相牵制，而不是互相帮助。
