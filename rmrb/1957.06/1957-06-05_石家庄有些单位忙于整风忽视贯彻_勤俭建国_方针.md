Xinhua News Agency report: Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently inspected capital construction in Shijiazhuang and found that phenomena such as excessively large scale, excessive land occupation, and excessively high construction standards still exist in capital construction. According to a preliminary inspection of thirty-two units, there are more than one thousand mu of abandoned vacant land. The cost of a nursery room in a factory workshop reached 75 yuan per square meter, and the purchase cost of various equipment in the room averaged 42 yuan per child.

Zhang Chengxian said that some units in Shijiazhuang are busy with rectification and handling internal contradictions among the people, and do not pay attention to checking the implementation of the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work, which is wrong. Facts have proved that truly establishing a spirit of building the country through thrift and hard work from leading cadres to the broad masses of the people can not only save a lot of construction investment for the country, but also help resolve internal contradictions among the people.

    石家庄有些单位
    忙于整风忽视贯彻“勤俭建国”方针
    据新华社讯　中共河北省委书记处书记张承先最近对石家庄市基本建设作了检查，发现在基本建设当中规模过大、占地过多、建筑标准过高等现象仍然存在。据三十二个单位的初步检查，荒废的成块空白地有一千多亩。有一个工厂的车间哺乳室，每平方公尺的造价高达七十五元，室内各种设备的购置费平均合每个小孩四十二元。
    张承先说，石家庄市有些单位忙于整风、忙于处理人民内部矛盾而不注意检查勤俭建国方针的执行情况，这是不对的。事实证明，从领导干部到广大群众真正树立起勤俭建国的风气，不仅能为国家节省大量的建设投资，还有利于人民内部矛盾的解决。
