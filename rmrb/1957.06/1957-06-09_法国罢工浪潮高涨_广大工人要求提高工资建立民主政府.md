Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th (via TASS): The strike wave in France has reached a new peak. According to "l'Humanité," at the call of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), 55% to 90% of bank employees in Paris and other provinces announced a 24-hour strike on June 5th. The Socialist Party's trade union organization, "Workers' Force," also participated in the strike. There are approximately 100,000 bank employees throughout France.

Five thousand construction workers in Roubaix and Le Havre also responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labour and the French Confederation of Christian Workers, announcing a strike on June 5th in support of demands for higher wages.

Dockworkers at the Jouenville wharf held a strike demanding an increase of 20 francs per hour. Employers attempted to use strikebreakers to undermine the strike. However, crane operators and workers operating other lifting equipment at the wharf refused to work in support of the strikers. Personnel on foreign ships docked at the wharf expressed their support for their French worker brothers.

The strike movement of chemical industry workers in France has also expanded. A two-hour strike was carried out in all chemical enterprises in the Lower Loire province. Workers at the "Kuhlmann" chemical trust enterprise in Paimboeuf held a 24-hour strike. Strikes were also held at some factories in other locations.

The Administrative Committee of the General Confederation of Labour pointed out on June 5th that more than two million working people have participated in the struggle to raise wages since the beginning of this year. It also said that in many enterprises, working people and trade union organizations affiliated with the "Workers' Force" confederation, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and some independent trade unions, together with members of the General Confederation of Labour, are demanding the establishment of a government that conforms to the will of the working people as expressed in the January 2, 1956 parliamentary elections.

    法国罢工浪潮高涨
    广大工人要求提高工资建立民主政府
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社巴黎6日讯：法国的罢工浪潮又达到了新的高峰。据“人道报”报道，在法国总工会和天主教劳工联盟的号召下，巴黎和其他一些省市的55％到90％的银行职工在6月5日宣布罢工二十四小时。社会党的工会组织“工人力量”也参加了罢工斗争。全法国银行职员的数目约有十万人。
    罗瓦伊扬和哈佛尔的五千名建筑工人也响应法国总工会和天主教劳工联盟的号召，在6月5日宣布罢工，支持提高工资的要求。
    儒恩维尔码头工人举行了罢工，要求把每小时的工资增加二十个法郎。企业主企图利用工贼破坏罢工。但是，码头的吊车工人和操纵其他起重设备的工人为了支持罢工者，拒绝工作。停泊在码头的外国船只的工作人员都对法国的工人兄弟表示支持。
    法国化学工业劳动者的罢工运动也扩大了。下罗亚尔省所有化学企业都进行了两小时罢工。潘贝夫市“曲曼”化学托拉斯企业工人举行了二十四小时罢工。其他地方的一些工厂也举行了罢工。
    法国总工会行政委员会5日指出，今年以来，已经有二百多万劳动人民参加了力争提高工资的斗争。它还说，在很多企业中，加入“工人力量”总工会、天主教劳工联盟的劳动人民和工会组织以及一些独立工会都同法国总工会会员一起要求建立一个符合劳动人民在1956年1月2日议会选举中所表达的意志的政府。
