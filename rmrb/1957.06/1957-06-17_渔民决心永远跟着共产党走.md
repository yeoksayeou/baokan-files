　　New Hailian, June 15th (by our reporter) - This reporter visited the fishermen on Xilian Island, off the coast of the Yellow Sea in Jiangsu Province. Labor model Tan Baoqing said, "In the past, our fishermen's nets would break nine out of ten times, our boats would leak nine out of ten times, we wore tattered burlap sacks, covered ourselves with torn fishing nets, sold our children, and begged in the streets, suffering all kinds of humiliation from the Kuomintang and the Japanese devils. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have organized mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and our lives have completely changed. Last year was the first year of organizing advanced cooperatives, and everyone received more than 540 yuan. In the first half of this year, the government also loaned us more than 40,000 yuan to repair our fishing gear and boats, and we will strive for even greater harvests. Who wouldn't be grateful for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for what we have today? We working people have no other way to go but to follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism."
　　Wu Kejun told reporters, "We fishermen don't grow grain. Before liberation, grain prices rose four or five times a day. One load of fish, 150 jin, could only be exchanged for about ten jin of corn. Now the government guarantees reasonable and stable grain prices, and one load of fish can be exchanged for 200 jin of rice. Isn't this the benefit of the policy of unified purchase and sales? In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, which of the counter-revolutionaries arrested on our island was not a bad guy with blood debts? Without eliminating them, how could we have such a stable life now?"

　　渔民决心永远跟着共产党走
    本报新海连15日电　本报记者访问了江苏省黄海之边西连岛上的渔民。劳动模范谭宝庆说，我们渔民过去十网九破，十船九漏，穿的是破麻袋，盖的是破渔网，卖儿卖女，沿街要饭，受尽了国民党、日本鬼子的凌辱。现在，共产党领导我们组织互助组、合作社，生活完全改了样子。去年是组织高级社的第一年，每人都分到五百四十多元。今年上半年，政府还贷款四万多元给我们修理渔具渔船，我们还要争取更大的丰收。我们能有今日，谁不感激共产党和毛主席的领导？我们劳动人民除了跟共产党走社会主义的路外，没有第二条路可走。
    武可均对记者说，我们渔民不种粮食，解放前，粮价一天四、五涨，一挑鱼一百五十斤，只换到十来斤苞米。现在政府保证了合理稳定的粮价，一挑鱼就可以换二百斤米，全岛一个月就供应了十二万斤粮食。这难道不是统购统销政策的好处吗？在肃反中，我们岛上所逮捕的反革命分子，哪一个不是血债累累的坏家伙？不把他们肃清，那有现在这样安定的生活。
