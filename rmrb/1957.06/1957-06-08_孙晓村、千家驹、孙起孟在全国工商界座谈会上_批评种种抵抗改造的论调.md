    Sun Xiaocun, Qian Jiaqu, and Sun Qimeng spoke at the 18th session of the National Conference of Industrial and Commercial Circles, refuting various erroneous arguments against reform. Sun Xiaocun, in his speech, analyzed the relationship between public and private sectors and offered his views on the key figures within the industrial and commercial circles. He believed that the left, middle, and right factions within the industrial and commercial circles are objectively existing phenomena, which have nothing to do with factional activities. Qian Jiaqu refuted the attempts by some to deny the dual nature of the bourgeoisie and confuse class essence. He pointed out that during the period of free discussion, it does not mean we can use capitalism to oppose socialism, nor does it mean that someone proposes an anti-socialist argument and we are not allowed to refute it. Sun Qimeng believed that the party and government's policies and guidelines for the reform of industrial and commercial circles are correct, and the achievements are significant. Currently, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie still exists. Those who equate the dual nature of the bourgeoisie with that of the working class are essentially denying their dual nature.

    Other speakers at the meeting included Lin Bingwei, deputy manager of Shanghai's public-private joint venture Slender Weaving Factory, who proposed that the representatives of the capitalists should participate in the current distribution of fixed dividends, hoping to solve the issues of remuneration for the representatives of the capitalists and the removal of their "hats," and to have a certain number of representative seats in organizations such as the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

    Peng Liu'an, vice-chairman and vice-secretary-general of the Hunan Federation of Industry and Commerce, believed that the issue of remuneration is a problem between the capitalists and their representatives, which should be resolved through negotiations between the two parties based on specific circumstances, and should not be borne by the government.

    Liu Guojun, a standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, shared his personal experiences to illustrate the wisdom and greatness of the government's buyout policy. He deeply felt the difficulty of ideological reform, saying that the bourgeoisie must "purify their hearts and souls, and undergo a metamorphosis." He also mentioned the issue of domestic and foreign trade at the meeting.

    Zhou Shiguan, a standing committee member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, first suggested that the "Monthly of the Industrial and Commercial Circles" should not include the title of vice-chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association in the upcoming article by Zhang Naiji. He then believed that the upper echelons of the industrial and commercial circles should pay attention to the tendency of alienation from the masses and self-satisfaction.

    Bi Mingqi also made a written speech at yesterday's meeting. Sun Xiaocun said:

    Resolutely Oppose Any Speech That Deviates from Socialism

    I am a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, which has 80% industrial and commercial workers and 20% non-industrial and commercial workers. I belong to the 20% non-industrial and commercial workers. Recently, when the comrades from the industrial and commercial circles hear us non-industrial and commercial comrades speak or report, they always criticize us for considering ourselves as reformers. We welcome this criticism wholeheartedly and regard it as a whip to improve our work. However, I would like to clarify that we have not considered ourselves as reformers, because I have this understanding: the comrades from the industrial and commercial circles have made significant progress in the practice of socialist reform over the past few years, which is an experience that we non-industrial and commercial comrades have not gone through, and we should learn from these progressive comrades from the industrial and commercial circles; we are indeed doing so. As for the views on the reform of the industrial and commercial circles, since we are comrades, we cannot help but speak out; this is another matter.

    My views on the public-private cooperative relationship in joint-venture enterprises and the role of key figures in the industrial and commercial circles.

    The main reason for the abnormal public-private relationship is that the thoughts of both the public and private sectors lag behind the objective situation.

    I would like to discuss the current issues in the public-private cooperative relationship in joint-venture enterprises based on my recent observations.

    I believe that there are many problems in the current public-private cooperative relationship in joint-venture enterprises, which seriously affect the enthusiasm of the private sector personnel and are detrimental to the production and operation of the enterprises.

    Where do these problems come from? There are many reasons, but I believe the most important one is: since the high tide of socialist reform, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has undergone profound changes, while the thoughts and awareness of many public and private personnel obviously lag behind this objective situation. They view new things with old eyes, resulting in abnormal public-private cooperative relationships in many joint-venture enterprises.

    What changes have occurred in the Chinese national bourgeoisie since the high tide of socialist reform? That is: this class is in the process of being eliminated, and its members are in the process of transforming from exploiters to laborers. This is the most important change, which could not have occurred before the high tide. To illustrate this point, it is necessary to analyze the various changes that have occurred since the high tide:

    The current special state of the national bourgeoisie: being eliminated while still existing.

    What changes indicate that the Chinese national bourgeoisie is in the process of being eliminated? First, after the high tide of socialist reform, the production relations in capitalist enterprises have undergone fundamental changes. The Chinese national bourgeoisie has handed over the enterprises, the three powers, and the means of production, and the material basis for the opposition between the working class and the bourgeoisie is beginning to be eliminated. Second, the conditions for developing capitalism no longer exist, and the role of the Chinese national bourgeoisie as a class in the national economy has become very small. Third, this class is undergoing intense division, and many people are willing to give up the fixed dividends and hope to become laborers as soon as possible.

    Since this is the case, why say that the class still exists? I believe that the Chinese national bourgeoisie as it was in the past no longer exists as a class, but they still own the means of production, which is reflected in the shares they hold, and they obtain a part of the social production through the form of fixed dividends. Such a group of people cannot be workers, farmers, or small-bourgeois intellectuals, and in fact, they can only exist as a bourgeoisie in the process of being eliminated. Therefore, the class still exists. This statement not only refers to ideological consciousness but also includes the material basis that is in the process of being eliminated. Being eliminated while still existing is the special state of the current Chinese national bourgeoisie.

    Duality is a class characteristic, not a stinky hat. No one has ever said that the negative side is un-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, or that it is about the five poisons. These words are said by those who deny duality to win over the masses by deliberately slandering others.

    What changes indicate that the industrial and commercial circles are in the process of transforming from exploiters to laborers? First, they are arranged in joint-venture enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and even state-owned enterprises to hold positions. They become public employees in these enterprises while still being private personnel. They have a new relationship with public representatives and the worker masses—cooperative working relationship, while still having a class relationship. Second, in these enterprises, they have done work for socialism, and most of them want to contribute their talents and do a good job, such as actively participating in socialist competitions; they also see clearly that their only bright future is to do a good job in the enterprise. Zhou Ling of Shanghai's food industry said well: "The industrial and commercial circles that want to do good things are absolutely the majority." Third, most of them actively study political theory, and some eagerly want to learn business skills, aiming to reform their thoughts, improve their awareness level, and learn skills. Fourth, for a part of them, the fixed dividends are their main income, but for most, the source of their living expenses is mainly dependent on wage income. Fifth, since the class still exists, the duality as a characteristic of the Chinese national bourgeoisie also still exists. Speaking of duality, there are several misunderstandings that need to be clarified: First, duality is a class characteristic, not a stinky hat. It should not be understood as "two-faced" or "two-faced three-knifes." The Chinese national bourgeoisie can take the glorious path of peaceful reform under the leadership of the Communist Party precisely because of duality. Therefore, mentioning duality should not cause a problem of hurting self-esteem. Second, saying that duality still exists means that duality is in the process of being eliminated while still existing. To be more specific, after the high tide, the content of duality has changed greatly: first, the positive side is expanding and becoming the main side, while the negative side is shrinking; second, the negative side is mainly ideological consciousness, but since there is ideological consciousness, it will naturally be reflected in behavior. The characteristics of this ideological consciousness are that they strongly reflect the nature of class contradictions. Third, since the high tide, no one has said that the negative side in politics is un-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, or that in economics it is about the five poisons. These words are said by those who deny that duality still exists in the debates to win over the masses by deliberately saying that the other side says so.

    Some public personnel have insufficient understanding of the profound changes in the national bourgeoisie, overemphasize class relationships, and do not recognize that the main relationship in the enterprise is the cooperative working relationship.

    From this, it can be seen that this change is very profound. If there is not enough understanding of this change, it is impossible not to make mistakes. I believe that many public representatives and workers in joint-venture enterprises have insufficient understanding of this change. They view the industrial and commercial circles after the high tide with the same eyes as they did before the high tide, before the general line, and even before the "Five Anti" campaign. As for me personally, I am a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a working member of the Central Committee. I also have insufficient understanding of this change, and thus have made many mistakes and shortcomings in my work.

    This lag in understanding the situation is mainly reflected in the views on the dual relationships in joint-venture enterprises. Some public personnel overemphasize class relationships in dual relationships and do not recognize that the main relationship in joint-venture enterprises is the cooperative working relationship. They do not recognize that the state places public and private personnel in an enterprise not to carry out class struggle but to mobilize all positive factors and utilize all forces to do a good job in the enterprise. Therefore, the cooperative working relationship is the main one. Only by doing a good job in the cooperative working relationship and fully respecting the authority of the private personnel can the private personnel work enthusiastically, contribute their talents, and play their role. As for class relationships, they are objectively existing and cannot be denied by anyone. But today's joint-venture enterprises are socialist enterprises, and anyone working in the enterprise cannot but follow the tasks of the enterprise. Therefore, it should be recognized that pointing out this class relationship, for public personnel, is a reminder that they have the responsibility to implement the party's policy of uniting, educating, and reforming the private personnel; for private personnel, it is a reminder that they should approach the public, learn humbly from the worker masses, be alert to their own still-existing negative side, and strive to further reform themselves, so that their thoughts and style are increasingly consistent with the socialist environment of the enterprise. The dual relationships in joint-venture enterprises will not exist for a long time. After a certain period, class relationships will inevitably be eliminated, and then the dual relationships will become a socialist cooperative working relationship. Even today, if handled well, although class relationships have not been eliminated, they will also be significantly reduced. Of course, this requires the joint efforts of both the public and private sectors.

    Only by giving the private personnel positions and authority can they be helped to further reform themselves through practice.

    Some public personnel have insufficient understanding of this change and, when dealing with private personnel, think that giving them positions and authority is no different from giving the bourgeoisie more things and the working class less things. As a result, they are cold and indifferent to them, pushing them aside. The result is that the private personnel feel discriminated against, feel that they have positions but no authority, feel that although they have talents, they have nowhere to contribute, and although they have enthusiasm, they have nowhere to express it. These public personnel think that they are loyal to the party and the country, have strong party spirit, and stable positions. In fact, they are violating the party's and government's policies and guidelines and doing things that are not beneficial to the party and the country. Because only by giving the private personnel positions and authority can they be helped to further reform themselves through work practice; and if the private personnel can fully exert their enthusiasm, they will definitely contribute to the socialist construction of the country. I suggest that the public personnel in joint-venture enterprises should carefully summarize the experiences and lessons of the public-private cooperative working relationship over the past year or so. From what we know, in the enterprises that have done well, it is beneficial to both construction and reform; while in the enterprises that have not done well, it has brought political losses to the party: first, the production and operation of the enterprise are affected; second, the enthusiasm of the private personnel is frustrated; third, it makes the private personnel doubt that the party's policy is one thing, but when implemented, it is another. This political loss is very great.

    It is true that the abnormal public-private relationship, in addition to some being due to the problems existing in the enterprise system, is sometimes also due to the insufficient experience of the public personnel (this is quite common) and the poor style of some people. However, the most important thing is the insufficient understanding of the great changes in the industrial and commercial circles. I believe that the party, the government, and the trade unions should vigorously help the public personnel and the worker masses to improve their understanding in this aspect, so that they understand that if they do not have enough understanding of the progress of the industrial and commercial circles, it is equivalent to denying the great achievements of the party's education. A member of the China Democratic National Construction Association in Nanjing said: "There is only class education, but no education on the class that is undergoing transformation." This sentence is worth our consideration.

    There are also many public representatives who have done a good job in this aspect. I saw several examples during my recent inspection, but I will not mention them here.

    Some private personnel are sensitive to words like "reform," "exploitation," and "duality," forgetting that they are still on the way from being exploiters to laborers and are still quite far from the destination.

    The above is about the public sector. Regarding the changes in the Chinese national bourgeoisie and its members after the high tide, do the private personnel also have insufficient understanding? The answer is definitely yes. This insufficient understanding is reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, they do not care about the enterprise as much as they did during the private operation period, do not dare to take charge and be the master in the enterprise, work less proactively, have a sense of inferiority, have a sense of being a guest, have a weak sense of political responsibility, do not dare to fight for their rights when they have positions but no authority, and are skeptical and doubtful about the party's and government's policies, holding the principle of "doing one's part in front of the door" and "being a monk for a day and ringing the bell for a day." The appearance of this situation is related to the attitude and style of the public representatives, as well as some of the systems in the enterprise, and it is also related to the insufficient education and help from the China Democratic National Construction Association and the inadequate representation of legal interests. However, from the perspective of the private personnel, it cannot be said that it is not a problem of ideological understanding, that is, they do not clearly understand that they have already left the material basis for exploitation, and the state has regarded them as public employees and required them to play their role. They only need to work actively and reform themselves to be worthy of being a worker in socialist construction.

    On the other hand: they think that since the enterprise has been handed over, their reform is almost complete, and there is no duality. If there is, it is only the difference between advanced and backward, which the working class also has, so they do not need to learn from the working class, and the class relationship should not be mentioned again. Recently, there has been such a mood: as soon as they hear the words "further self-reform," "bourgeois ideology," and "exploitation" and "duality," they become sensitive. The appearance of this situation is worth studying. Among the reasons, there is a component caused by the lack of attention to their progress and the shortcomings of propaganda and education work, but the main thing is the manifestation of arrogance and self-satisfaction. Some comrades in the industrial and commercial circles forget that the arrival of the high tide, in addition to the two factors of the party's education and the patriotic thoughts and political awareness of the industrial and commercial circles, also has the role of the party and government's policies of utilizing, restricting, and reforming in the political and economic environment of the Chinese national bourgeoisie at that time. Without these, relying solely on the power of education and patriotic thoughts, it would still be impossible to have the high tide; they forget that the bourgeoisie still exists, and they are still on the way from being exploiters to laborers, and the destination is still quite far away, and self-reform still has a painful process. Therefore, this is obviously a serious problem of ideological understanding.

    Denying duality, unwilling to further reform, and saying that they are already the same as the working class is precisely a nostalgia for their original class and a negative manifestation.

    The reason why the public personnel's thoughts lag behind the situation is inseparable from their factional sentiments and subjective and dogmatic thinking. The reason why the private personnel have insufficient or incorrect understanding of the changes in their class and members is due to the limitations of class nature. This self-abasement and self-exaltation are essentially the manifestation of the negative side of duality. Denying that there is still duality, unwilling to further reform oneself, afraid of being criticized for bourgeois ideology, and saying that they are now the same as the working class is precisely a nostalgia for their original class and a reflection of the existence of duality.

    Comrades in the industrial and commercial circles must be good at distinguishing various viewpoints. Some viewpoints, although they conform to one's feelings, are dangerous weeds.

    If the above analysis is still in line with the facts, then in order to improve the public-private cooperative working relationship and give full play to the enthusiasm of the private personnel, in addition to the public personnel quickly improving their ideological understanding and improving their work style and methods, the private personnel must also seriously carry out self-reform and overcome the current situation of relaxing self-reform. Comrades in the industrial and commercial circles should realize that ideological reform is a long-term and arduous process, and breaking away from capitalism and establishing socialism is a repeated and painful self-struggle. Therefore, they must be good at distinguishing which viewpoints are the flowers in the garden of ideological reform and which viewpoints, although very in line with one's feelings, are dangerous weeds. The China Democratic National Construction Association has not done enough in representing the legal interests of the industrial and commercial circles in the past, and the educational work has also not been done enough. In the future, it should actively represent what should be represented and not just reflect it. As for the ideological education work, it must seriously review the past shortcomings and, with the spirit of sharing the same fate and breathing the same breath with the industrial and commercial circles, help the industrial and commercial circles to advance rapidly on the road of ideological reform. As for the specific measures and methods to improve the public-private relationship, everyone has talked about it a lot, and I will not talk about it again.

    Key figures must unite the middle and even the backward layers and lead them to turn to the middle and left through their exemplary actions. Such key figures are truly key figures.

    The China Democratic National Construction Association takes the cultivation of industrial and commercial workers as key figures as its working guideline. The experience of several years has proven that this working guideline is correct. But what is the current situation? The key figures are quite frustrated, and they have insufficient understanding of their role. The masses have opinions about the key figures, and some people associate key figures with factional activities. Therefore, I would like to say a few words to the key figures in the industrial and commercial circles.

    Why is it necessary to cultivate key figures? What role can key figures play? In a society, a class, a group, or even in a political party with the same belief, the understanding of objective truth and the attitude towards objective truth are not the same for every member. The ancients said: "The understanding of the way has its early and late." This is probably the meaning. Since they are not the same, there will naturally be advanced, middle, and backward people. This is an objective law, and the industrial and commercial circles are no exception. This does not mean to belittle the middle and backward layers. After all, left, middle, and right are not fixed and unchanging. Today's middle can become left tomorrow, and today's right can become middle tomorrow. Therefore, the responsibility of the key figures is to unite the middle and even the backward layers and lead them to turn to the left and middle through their exemplary actions. If the key figures are arrogant and self-satisfied, alienated from the masses, and cannot play such a role, then, as Minister Li Weihan said (roughly like this), such key figures are bloodless and fleshless, just a pile of dry bones, and they are not key figures at all. Key figures are not what they are called, and as key figures, they only have the obligation to do more work and do not have the right to be arrogant and self-satisfied.

    From the history of the industrial and commercial circles accepting socialist reform, the role of the key figures has been quite significant. Long before the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns, there were some advanced elements in the industrial and commercial circles who were interested in socialism and believed in the party's policies and guidelines. These comrades played a good role in dispelling doubts and taking the lead in the "Five Anti" campaign and later in the announcement of the general line. In the winter of 1955, after hearing Chairman Mao's great instructions on understanding the laws of social development and grasping one's own destiny, the key figures first took the lead in self-examination at the national meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and later at the people's congresses in various places. At that time, the number of advanced people in the industrial and commercial circles was increasing, and this situation was undoubtedly a driving force for the arrival of the high tide. From this, it can be seen that the existence of left, middle, and right in the industrial and commercial circles is an objective fact, and because the party led the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to grasp this objective law, cultivate key figures to lead the middle, influence the backward, and continuously expand the ranks of the left and middle, the full row of public-private joint ventures was finally successfully promoted.

    While affirming the role of the key figures, it is also necessary to point out the shortcomings of the key figures. According to the reflections of many comrades in the industrial and commercial circles, in the past year or so, many key figures have shown a tendency to alienate from the masses, not caring about the work, study, and life of the masses, not daring to actively represent the legal interests and reasonable demands of the masses, and their common language with the masses is gradually decreasing. This is not a good thing. More seriously, some key figures put themselves above the masses and regard themselves as reformers, creating a situation of opposition to the masses. In these problems, I believe that the United Front Work Department and the China Democratic National Construction Association have some responsibility, that is, they have not cared for and helped the key figures enough, criticized their shortcomings and mistakes not enough, and have not timely solved the contradictions between their social activities and their posts.

    The objective existence of left, middle, and right in the industrial and commercial circles has nothing to do with factional activities. Some people's views are more consistent with the party's, so they naturally have more contact with the party members. In this regard, I do not agree with Zhang Naiji's criticism of the United Front Work Department.

    The objective existence of left, middle, and right, as well as the work of the China Democratic National Construction Association to cultivate key figures, has nothing to do with factional activities. In the industrial and commercial circles, the China Democratic National Construction Association, is there factional activity? That should be seriously examined. But since there are left, middle, and right in the industrial and commercial circles, then when the China Democratic National Construction Association does work, in order to understand the situation and do a good job, sometimes it has separate meetings and discussions with these people or those people. Is this factional activity? Of course not. Just take the China Democratic National Construction Association as an example. On some issues, there are also differences between left, middle, and right. Sometimes these few comrades discuss a problem or help the other few comrades to have some discussions. This is also indispensable. Then, is this activity also factional activity? Of course not. To distinguish factional activities, one must look at whether it is for the fundamental interests of socialism. Factional activities are for the private interests of a few people and are unprincipled in excluding others. In terms of methods, they are ruthless. As key figures, factional sentiments should not be allowed, and if there are such sentiments, they will alienate from the masses, let alone factional activities. We oppose factional sentiments and even more oppose factional activities. Any organization does not allow factional activities, and factional activities are destructive to the organization. Therefore, when looking at a problem, one should look at it from the essence and content, and not just from the form and surface. Otherwise, a few comrades who have more contact will be regarded as factional activities, which is looking at people with factional eyes and not trusting comrades, which is very detrimental to work.

    Since there are left, middle, and right in the industrial and commercial circles and in the China Democratic National Construction Association, then on a certain issue, there will naturally be some people whose views are more consistent with the party's policies and guidelines, and with the views of the party members participating in the work of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Since the views are consistent, they will naturally have more contact, and the content of the contact is undoubtedly to expand the views and opinions they think are correct and influence others. Can this be called factional activity? Can this be said to be the United Front Work Department participating in factional activities? This view is obviously wrong. Speaking of this, I want to explain that on this issue, I do not agree with Comrade Zhang Naiji's criticism of the United Front Work Department in the article "Starting from the Thought Basis of Walls and Trenches." I believe that the relationship between the democratic parties and the United Front Work Department can have organizational exchanges, and it can also have personal exchanges. Besides, organizational exchanges are also unavoidable through individuals. As for the first point, I think no one would think it should not be. The question is whether the members and workers of the democratic parties can also request the comrades of the United Front Work Department to exchange views on work issues and the understanding of policies and guidelines? I think it is completely possible. The members of the democratic parties request to talk with the United Front Work Department, I think the United Front Work Department has no reason to refuse. Conversely, the United Front Work Department can also invite some comrades from the democratic parties to exchange views on work issues. Doing so is only beneficial and not detrimental to the work of the democratic parties. It has been done too little in the past, not too much. Since the United Front Work Department has not restricted which people can come to exchange views and which people cannot; and for the members of the democratic parties, this contact is only a help to the individual, without any constraints on the individual or even the organization. I do not see any similarity between this exchange and factional activities? There may be some individuals in the democratic parties with bad style, using the name of the United Front Work Department to pressure others, and even engaging in factional activities. That should be opposed. But this is another matter. If because of individual phenomena, all such exchanges are said to be factional activities, and even said that the United Front Work Department is participating in factional activities, then the relationship between the democratic parties and the United Front Work Department is limited to organizational exchanges, and other exchanges are suspected of factional activities. This not only does not conform to the facts but also blocks the normal exchanges between the democratic parties and the United Front Work Department.

    In short, as key figures, they should strictly require themselves, overcome all arrogance, self-satisfaction, and alienation from the masses, and should unite and help the middle without exception, leading the backward. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we should also have sufficient understanding of the role of the key figures, have sufficient sympathy for their difficulties, and especially should not look at them with factional sentiments. Doing so is not beneficial to the unity of everyone to move forward together. This major issue of right and wrong should not be confused.

    Oppose any speech that deviates from socialism, regardless of the way it is expressed.

    Finally, I would like to say a few more words. We help the party to rectify its style, and there is a matter of stance. This stance is "everything for socialism." Precisely because of the better unity of the people of the whole country to build socialism, the party therefore rectifies its style and eliminates the three evils, and we therefore expose the contradictions within the people and help the party to rectify its style. Therefore, as long as it is beneficial to socialism, beneficial to consolidating and strengthening the party's core leadership role in the people of the whole country and socialist construction, no matter how sharp the criticism is, it should be welcomed. But any speech that deviates from socialism, no matter how it is expressed, should be resolutely opposed. During this period of great freedom of speech, our comrades in the industrial and commercial circles and the China Democratic National Construction Association have put forward many criticisms and opinions to the party. I personally believe that these criticisms and opinions are mostly from the stance of "everything for socialism." However, there are also some criticisms and opinions that are wrong, which are not conducive to the further self-reform of the industrial and commercial circles, and some of these opinions even, to varying degrees, show extremely wrong attitudes towards the party, the working class, Marxism-Leninism, and socialism. These speeches, we must, based on the great formula of unity-criticism-unity, exert the spirit of free discussion, clarify the truth, and distinguish right from wrong. Comrades, this is a serious task.

    Qian Jiaqu said:

    Do not use the pretext of anti-dogmatism to peddle capitalist goods

    Since I made a speech at the last meeting of the industrial and commercial circles, many friends in the industrial and commercial circles have expressed different opinions about my speech, which is good. Because through the debate, the problem can be made clearer, and the truth becomes clearer through debate. We should not be afraid of others' criticism, and we should welcome others' opposing opinions, which can help us to see the problem from various different angles. Only I can speak, and you cannot speak, and even think that someone has expressed a different opinion, which is suppressing others. This attitude is not good. We are now helping the party to rectify its style, which is equivalent to treating the party's illness. For the shortcomings in the party's work on the reform of capitalist industrial and commercial circles, the industrial and commercial circles can prescribe medicine, and the non-industrial and commercial circles can also prescribe medicine. Through the debate, the real source of the disease can be found, and the medicine can be prescribed accordingly. If there are different opinions, a dogmatism hat is put on the person who expresses a different opinion. I think this method is not appropriate.

    The public-private relationship and whether the industrial and commercial circles have duality are two different types of problems and cannot be mixed together.

    I want to talk about two issues:

    First, I believe that we must distinguish between two different types of problems. Today, in some joint-venture enterprises, the public-private relationship is not normal, and some private representatives have positions but no authority, and their enthusiasm has not been fully exerted. To solve this type of problem, a series of systems need to be formulated, and the education of the buyout policy and the united front policy needs to be carried out in joint-venture enterprises. As for whether the industrial and commercial circles still have duality and whether they need to continue to be reformed, this is another type of problem. These two types of problems are related but cannot be mixed together.

    In improving the public-private relationship in joint-venture enterprises, I basically agree with Sheng Pu's opinion. The decision-making work and the executive work in the enterprise should be separated in terms of authority. Major issues and principle issues should be decided by the party, government (including private administrative personnel), workers, and youth league in the enterprise through appropriate meeting systems under the unified leadership of the party and public representatives. As for the implementation of decisions and daily affairs, they should be handled by the administrative departments of the enterprise according to administrative ranks. This method, on the one hand, ensures the leadership of the public in the enterprise, and on the other hand, can eliminate the current phenomenon of unclear responsibilities in the public-private cooperative relationship, so that the private personnel can have positions, authority, and responsibilities.

    In joint-venture enterprises, there are not only public-private relationships but also relationships between private personnel and the worker masses. In my last speech, I said: "There was a wall between the labor and capital... This wall was built mainly by the capitalists, and today the capitalists want to demolish it, while the workers have not demolished it or have not completely demolished it. This is very natural, and the capitalists should have patience." These few words have caused a lot of resentment among the industrial and commercial circles, and I think this is a misunderstanding. Does this mean that there is no historical class hatred between labor and capital? Does this mean that this class hatred should be blamed on the laborers? To completely demolish this wall, the capitalists should have the greatest patience and change the impression of the worker masses through work and life. How can these words be understood as asking the industrial and commercial circles to "be content with injustice"? It should be known that many worker masses have resistance to the government's buyout policy and think that the government is too considerate of the capitalists today. Vice Premier Chen Yun said at the meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on December 15 last year: "The relationship between the workers and the capitalists can be improved, but we should also estimate the historical opposition that has been left behind, which is not quickly changing. Our task is to work from all aspects to narrow this gap." He also pointed out: "The government and the trade unions should widely carry out the education of the buyout policy for the workers... The private personnel should take an active and correct attitude in improving the public-private relationship. The so-called active is not to seek no fault, but to work actively without fear of difficulties and setbacks." Vice Premier Chen Yun's words are still correct today.

    Denying duality does not mean that duality does not exist. Some people want to take the fixed dividends and also want to remove the "hat." Is this not a manifestation of duality?

    To improve the public-private cooperative relationship and give full play to the enthusiasm of the private personnel, I believe that we should proceed simultaneously from the three aspects of strengthening the education of the buyout policy for the worker masses and public personnel, establishing a set of systems for the public-private cooperative relationship, and the private personnel taking an active and correct attitude towards work, instead of denying duality and denying that the fixed dividends are exploitation. This way, the problem cannot be solved. Denying duality does not mean that duality does not exist, and denying class relationships does not mean that class relationships have been eliminated.

Title: The Two-Faced Nature of the National Bourgeoisie and the Issue of Helping the Party Rectify Its Style of Work
Author: 孙起孟

Page: 1

Regarding the two-faced nature, we should conduct specific analyses based on historical circumstances. Everyone knows that the two-faced nature in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution differs from that in the stage of the Socialist Revolution. The content of the two-faced nature before and after the full industry joint operation is also different. No one has said that the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie today still refers to the economic "five poisons" or the political non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary attitudes. However, some people insist on this and use it to deny the existence of the two-faced nature.

At the same time, we have repeatedly pointed out: the active side of the two-faced nature is the main side, and it is continuously expanding and developing. The passive side is the secondary side, and it is shrinking and gradually being eliminated. The so-called active side and passive side mainly refer to attitudes towards socialism and are mainly manifested in ideology. However, some people think that talking about the two-faced nature is emphasizing the passive side, which will dampen the enthusiasm of the private sector personnel. This is not without reason.

We also believe: the class is undergoing intense division, and industrial and commercial personnel are gradually transforming into laborers. At the same time, the degree of the two-faced nature among industrial and commercial personnel is extremely uneven, with some having more and some having less, and the forms of manifestation are also different. But from a large number of observations, that is, observing as a class, the two-faced nature still exists. I mentioned last time that some people reflected that "before the joint operation, they were the rulers of a small country, and after the joint operation, they were the subjects of a great country," and so on. This is just an example to illustrate the point. I did not say that all industrial and commercial personnel are like this. However, some people think that this is generalizing from individual examples.

I would like to add here that the passive side of industrial and commercial personnel, as proven by the recent Great Debate, seems to be more serious than we had imagined. The struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road has been completely resolved with the decisive victory of socialist transformation; but the struggle between capitalist ideology and socialist ideology seems not to have been completely resolved. Isn't there still someone who openly advocates that bureaucratism is more terrifying than capitalism? This shows that the ideological education of the bourgeoisie is a long-term and arduous task. In the past, we always thought that denying the two-faced nature and denying that dividends are exploitation was just the opinion of one or two individuals. In this debate, isn't it proven that they still have a considerable market? In the debate, it was also exposed that some industrial and commercial personnel want to receive dividends, and they don't want to wear the bourgeoisie hat anymore. Isn't this a manifestation of the two-faced nature?

From criticizing shortcomings to denying the basic principles of our country's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, using the banner of anti-dogmatism to peddle a large amount of capitalist goods, is completely wrong.

The second issue I would like to discuss is about helping the Party rectify its style of work and the further transformation of industrial and commercial personnel. Industrial and commercial personnel helping the Party rectify its style of work aims to expose the shortcomings of the Party's work in transforming capitalist industry and commerce, to expose contradictions, and to improve work. This is one thing. To further transform themselves into self-reliant laborers, industrial and commercial personnel need to continue learning and accept further transformation. This is another thing. Do not confuse the two. The state's work in transforming capitalist industry and commerce has shortcomings. In my last speech, I also mentioned this, especially regarding the issue of removing the hats of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial personnel. The government did not promptly formulate appropriate measures to implement, and as one of the responsible persons of the Central Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Administration, I did not actively propose opinions. This should be criticized. But if by criticizing shortcomings, the basic principles of our country's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are denied, and even the basic principles of Marxism are denied, and all are labeled as dogmatism to be opposed, and even under the banner of anti-dogmatism, a large amount of capitalist goods are peddled, that is completely wrong. We should oppose dogmatism, but not oppose the basic principles of Marxism. Using revisionism and capitalism to oppose dogmatism is something we absolutely cannot agree with. For example, regarding the dividend issue, some people think that dividends are not exploitation but unearned income. This is strange. Income that comes from the ownership of means of production and is not earned through labor, what is it if not exploitation? The purpose of this argument is nothing more than to fundamentally deny that the bourgeoisie still exists as a residual exploiting class in our country today. If this theory is established, then all our transformation work, that is, the task of further transforming them into self-reliant laborers, will become meaningless. This has nothing in common with Marxism.

Again, some people say that the bourgeoisie has a two-faced nature, then the proletariat also has a two-faced nature. They also say that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat have essential differences, but bourgeoisie individuals and proletariat individuals have no essential differences. (The ability to transform does not mean there are no essential differences. Just as a landlord can transform into a peasant, can it be said that peasants and landlords have no essential differences?) Where is the theory in this? This is sophistry or playing tricks.

I mentioned last time that in the stage of the Socialist Revolution, it is necessary to eliminate the capitalist system of ownership. It should be confiscated, and logically, it should be confiscated. This is what should be done according to the task of the Socialist Revolution, but due to China's specific historical conditions, we do not adopt confiscation but adopt the form of compensation. Compensation is a means to eliminate the capitalist system of ownership by the bourgeoisie, and it is a peaceful transformation. It is one thing, not two things. In the eyes of Marxists, the capitalist system of ownership is by no means sacred and inviolable. This is fundamentally different from the reformist theory of the bourgeoisie. Now some people propose to compensate to the end, that is, to pay dividends for twenty years (some even propose thirty-five years). Shouldn't this idea be criticized?

It is true that during the debate, any problem can be raised for discussion, but it does not mean that we can use capitalism to oppose socialism, nor does it mean that even if someone puts forward anti-socialist arguments (naturally, there will be no one today who openly opposes socialism, it will always appear in various different forms), we are not allowed to refute them. To think that a refutation is suppressing debate, is dogmatism, what logic is this? It should be recognized that debate is to allow different opinions, to argue with each other, and to persuade those who are wrong. The hat of dogmatism will not scare anyone.

Li Kangnian's proposal is firmly standing on the bourgeoisie's position. From his proposal, it can be seen how tenaciously the bourgeoisie's ideology is manifesting itself.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about Mr. Li Kangnian's speech. Regarding Li Kangnian's proposal for dividends for twenty years, I mentioned in my last speech that this is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's passivity. Recently, Li Kangnian mentioned in his speech that I have not seen the original text of his proposal. Indeed, this is a fact. After Li Kangnian's speech, I carefully read his "Proposal on Dividends" at the first session of the Second People's Congress of Shanghai, "Supplementary Reasons for the Proposal on Dividends," and "The Issue of the Government's Policy of Peaceful Transformation of Industrial and Commercial Enterprises by Implementing the Dividend System from the Perspective of My Study of Philosophy," and listened to his speech this time. I think that the criticism last time was basically correct, although it was not comprehensive enough. Li Kangnian's proposal, although it contains a small amount of reasonable content (for example, simplifying procedures), the overall spirit is firmly standing on the bourgeoisie's position, and the consideration for the bourgeoisie is truly meticulous. He not only insists on the compensation of "220 million yuan must be fully paid," but also this 220 million yuan of compensation bonds is issued from January 1, 1958, and the 220 million yuan already paid in 1956 and 1957 is not included. The additional 220 million yuan is used to compensate the agents of the private sector (including directors, supervisors, etc.) for their compensation, named "reward" for the agents of the private sector and "consolation money" for the needy bourgeoisie individuals to console them for the losses suffered due to class struggle. He not only misinterprets Chairman Mao's speech at the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, misinterprets the editorial of the People's Daily on November 22, 1955, but also distorts Marx's statement that compensation will be the cheapest for the proletariat (note: Marx's statement is from Engels' "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," and the original text is: "We do not consider that the compensation method is inadmissible in any case; Marx once told me [and told me many times] that his opinion was that if we could completely get rid of this gang by the compensation method, it would be the cheapest for us."). In Li Kangnian's view, since compensation is "the cheapest for the proletariat," it is naturally "the most disadvantaged for the bourgeoisie," but "they are still a bit dissatisfied in their hearts, thinking that the capitalists are too cheap." In his view, this is truly "inverting right and wrong." Li Kangnian suggested in the symposium that his proposal be published in full by the People's Publishing House and discussed at the grassroots level nationwide. I personally agree with Li Kangnian's suggestion (as long as the paper is not too tight). Publishing Li Kangnian's proposal nationwide for discussion, to be honest, this proposal will definitely not be accepted, because it is not beneficial to the transformation of industrial and commercial personnel and is not beneficial to socialism. But from his proposal, it can be seen how tenaciously the bourgeoisie's ideology is manifesting itself, making the industrial and commercial circles realize that ideological transformation is such a arduous task, which will be of great help in breaking capitalism and establishing socialism.

The basic principles of socialism are unshakable. All speeches that are not conducive to the self-transformation and self-education of the industrial and commercial circles should be criticized.

Now the Party has proposed "work and rectification without neglecting either," and I also want to propose the idea of "transformation and rectification without neglecting either" to the industrial and commercial circles. To help the Party rectify its style of work, we should put forward all kinds of different opinions as much as possible, but the basic principles of socialism are unshakable, and all speeches that are not conducive to the self-transformation and self-education of the industrial and commercial circles should be criticized. We should be practical and not seek popularity. The feelings of the industrial and commercial circles today we can understand. Some people have a lot of grievances and want to vent them, but do not let emotions replace reason, and complaints cannot replace analysis. Some people say that we are helping the Party rectify its style of work, not helping the industrial and commercial personnel rectify their style of work. But the purpose of helping the Party rectify its style of work is to improve the Party's work, which is beneficial to the further transformation of the industrial and commercial personnel, and is for the construction of socialism, not to replace socialist ideology with capitalist ideology. Any view and action that deviates from this fundamental guideline, I think, is wrong. For the benefit of the industrial and commercial personnel themselves, it should be avoided.

Sun Qimeng said: Without the standard of socialism, the desire for unity has no content.

The policy and principles of transformation are correct, and the achievements of the work are fundamental and primary.

The Party's rectification this time is mainly to oppose bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We help the Party rectify its style of work, and in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, it is also to oppose these three "isms." From the phenomena exposed, there are many problems. The party that led the Chinese people to victory in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution has so many problems. What is this? Is it a mistake in work? Or is it a mistake in line and policy? Or is it both? I think there should be a basic assessment. In this regard, I agree with the views of some comrades in their speeches: the Party's policy and principles in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce are correct and in line with China's actual situation; the work has basically realized the policy and tasks, and the achievements of the work are the fundamental and primary aspects. At the same time, there are many bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. This is why, in the great victory of socialist transformation, there are still many problems and unnecessary losses. There are problems, and we need to expose them to clarify right and wrong, correct mistakes, consolidate the achievements we have made, and continuously develop and consolidate the socialist cause.

Some party members and cadres have "leftist" tendencies in their assessment of the changes in the national bourgeoisie during social transformation.

After the high tide, the socialist revolution has basically been completed, but in our real life, it is clear that the national bourgeoisie still exists. Then, how do we understand the changes in this class during the great social transformation? To raise such a question is very natural. If there is a deviation in the assessment, it is bound to lead to a deviation in handling class relations, so this question has great practical significance. I agree with the views of some comrades in their speeches that there are "leftist" tendencies in the assessment, and the manifestations and consequences of "leftism" have been mentioned by comrades many times. I just want to supplement a few points about the main problems of "leftism."

First, the problem lies in the lack of recognition of the significant changes in the social status of the national bourgeoisie after the high tide. After the high tide, the capitalist mode of production based on the ownership of means of production has been eliminated in our social life, and the capitalists in the joint-venture enterprises, whether they are aware of it or not, are working for socialism. Therefore, to still regard them as capitalists like before the high tide is to deviate from reality.

Second, the problem lies in the insufficient recognition of the positive role of the national bourgeoisie after the great social transformation. The phrase "the national bourgeoisie is wealth" has played a role in clarifying the idea of regarding them as a "burden" and has also inspired their enthusiasm. However, generally speaking, it is still mainly to see their role in socialist transformation and their influence in society, while the recognition of their mastery of modern culture, modern enterprise technology, and management knowledge is insufficient. Many people have not seen that, due to the fundamental change in the production relations, the culture, technology, and knowledge that the capitalists originally used for capitalist exploitation or were not for the service of socialism, now must depend on the socialist economic base to serve it. Therefore, the skills of the private sector personnel must also become a wealth in socialist construction. Not seeing this, one does not understand how to fully utilize the private sector personnel, give full play to their strengths, help them learn and transform, help them do a good job, which is both in line with the wishes of the national bourgeoisie and in line with the interests of the working class. Not seeing this, one does not understand that arranging the private sector personnel but not using them well, letting them make contributions, not only will the private sector personnel have opinions, but it will also be detrimental to the working class. Not seeing this, one does not understand why to learn from the capitalists and what to learn from them. Regarding the positive role of the national bourgeoisie in socialist construction, many people have underestimated it and have insufficient recognition.

Third, the problem lies in the lack of specific analysis of the situation of the national bourgeoisie, especially their changes after the high tide, and the failure to distinguish between what is good and what is bad in an objective manner, giving appropriate affirmation or negation. Indiscriminate affirmation is not good, and indiscriminate negation will hurt the hearts of many people. Not seeing that many people in the industrial and commercial circles have their hearts turned towards socialism and the Communist Party, and such people will only increase and will not decrease. Some people, on the surface, are calm and reserved, and on some issues, even maintain relatively conservative views, but their patriotic hearts are not inferior to others, and their deep affection for the work in the enterprise and their determination to contribute their skills to the country are also firm. If one is "leftist" and indiscriminately negates the positive aspects of the industrial and commercial circles, it will hurt the enthusiasm of these people.

The formation of "leftist" tendencies has many causes, one of which is that the national bourgeoisie is not simply good or bad, but has both aspects, which is determined by their class position under China's conditions. The two-faced nature is relatively difficult to grasp, and if one does not analyze it well, it is easy to be biased towards one side or the other, that is, it is easy to be "leftist" or rightist.

Currently, industrial and commercial personnel are both capitalists and laborers. This dual identity is reflected in their political stance and style of work, which is both socialist and capitalist.

Regarding the issue of the two-faced nature, there has been a relatively long discussion, and many comrades have expressed their opinions at this symposium. Can we not say that after the discussion, the number of people who agree that the national bourgeoisie still has a two-faced nature after the high tide has increased, that is, the consensus on this issue has expanded? Of course, whether the two-faced nature exists or not can still be studied, but what needs to be further discussed may be the change in the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie after the high tide. Is there a change? If there is a change, how does it change? Regarding this, I would like to express some immature opinions for the comrades to correct.

The two-faced nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, as pointed out by Chairman Mao in "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," is their contradictory attitude towards the Chinese revolution. This contradictory attitude is determined by their class position and the social conditions of China. Therefore, with the development of the revolutionary situation and the changes in the economic and social status of the national bourgeoisie, their two-faced nature must also change, and it is impossible not to change. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his report to the Eighth National Congress, summarized the changes in their two-faced nature from the period of the democratic revolution to the period of the socialist revolution, and clearly pointed out that their two-faced nature is changing and is changing with the development of society. The current characteristic is that they have entered the realm of socialism, but they still retain capitalist elements. Two factors influence the change in their two-faced nature: one is their economic and social status, and the other is their personal transformation. From the perspective of their economic and social status, they are no longer the capitalists of the private enterprise period. Their identity has undergone significant changes. From the fact that they still have exploitative income, it cannot be said that they are no longer capitalists (some individual laborers have joined the public-private joint ventures and become dividend recipients, and such people are naturally not capitalists just because they receive dividends); from the fact that they work in enterprises and institutions for the service of socialism, it cannot be said that they have begun to become laborers. Therefore, they cannot be simply and abstractly called capitalists or laborers, but can only be dialectically, that is, scientifically, called both capitalists and laborers. It sounds contradictory, but such a statement may reflect objective facts. Their social status determines that they cannot but have a two-faced nature, reflected in their political stance and style of work, which is both the side of laborers, that is, the socialist side, and the side of capitalists, that is, the capitalist side.

Has the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie members reached this stage and stopped changing? No, their external and internal conditions do not allow them not to change, and they are indeed changing. As a class characteristic, the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie, from the current situation, can be roughly divided into three types: one is that the socialist side (mainly referring to their economic life and political stance) has grown a lot and quickly; the second is that the capitalist side is basically still dominant, and the socialist side has grown very little and slowly, or has not grown at all; the third is the intermediate state. Here, the political stance mainly refers to their political attitude towards socialism. The political stance is naturally closely related to their economic life, but self-transformation also plays a very important role. The above three types of situations will not be unchanging. Can we estimate that the general trend is towards the first type of situation, but we should also see that in the process of transforming into laborers, there will always be people whose political stance and style of work are mainly bourgeoisie or change very little.

What factors cause the existence of the above three different situations among the members of the national bourgeoisie? And what factors cause the above three situations to develop and change towards the first situation? The key lies in education and transformation, in continuing self-education and self-transformation. The value of the discussion on the two-faced nature lies in the fact that it can make us clarify the future direction and tasks of the industrial and commercial circles' education and transformation (placing this work in an appropriate position) and what problems need to be solved, and how the content of their transformation differs from that of the working class, etc.

In summary, my views can be summed up in the following five points:

First, the national bourgeoisie has a two-faced nature. Those who equate this two-faced nature with the advanced and backward two-faced nature of the working class are actually denying that they have a two-faced nature.

Second, does the national bourgeoisie have a two-faced nature after the high tide? I think there is a two-faced nature, not no two-faced nature. The two-faced nature is not static. After the high tide, the change is more significant and profound. Their two-faced nature has changed to: in social status, political stance, and style of work, they are still capitalists on one hand, and on the other hand, they have begun to gradually transform into laborers. Such a two-faced nature will continue to change until it is eliminated. Therefore, it is not appropriate to equate the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie with the advanced and backward two-faced nature of the working class. Those who say that the national bourgeoisie only has the advanced and backward two-faced nature are, in essence, denying that they have a two-faced nature. As for saying that the passive side of the two-faced nature after the high tide is still the "five poisons," this is obviously a misunderstanding. If there are indeed such misunderstandings in the industrial and commercial circles, we all have the responsibility to explain it to them clearly.

Third, what is the characteristic of the change in the two-faced nature in the future? The general trend is that the capitalist side, that is, the capitalist side, continues to gradually shrink, and the laborer side, that is, the socialist side, continues to gradually expand. Among the members of the national bourgeoisie, there objectively exist three situations: those who have made a lot and quick progress, those who have made very little and slow progress, and the intermediate state. Not recognizing such changes within the national bourgeoisie also makes it difficult to understand the overall trend of the development and change of the two-faced nature.

Fourth, two important factors influence the change in the two-faced nature: one is the economic and social status of the national bourgeoisie members, and the other is their personal transformation. After the fundamental change in the production relations, personal transformation has a prominent role in the change in the two-faced nature.

Fifth, is the two-faced nature good or bad? This depends on what it is compared with. Compared with the working class, it is naturally not good, because the two-faced nature still has the capitalist side. However, if the Chinese national bourgeoisie is compared with the bourgeoisie of capitalist countries, having a two-faced nature is its advantage. Compared with its own history and reality, it should also be seen that it has undergone great changes and progress. Because there is a bad side, there is still a task of transformation and a goal to strive for; because there is a good side, there is no need to be self-abased, but to have great confidence and effort to carry out self-transformation.

Incidentally, let me say a few words about whether the two-faced nature is a hat. The appropriateness of the language is a secondary issue, the important thing is the viewpoint it represents and the situation it reflects. People hear such words and think: since it is a hat put on by others, is there any need to study it? In fact, many people in the industrial and commercial circles know that the two-faced nature is the characteristic that distinguishes the national bourgeoisie from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. The bureaucratic bourgeoisie has no two-faced nature, so it can only be the object of the revolution to be overthrown. Precisely because of this characteristic of the two-faced nature, the national bourgeoisie has become the object of the working class to unite and win over, has become the ally of the working class; precisely because of this characteristic, they have the possibility of accepting socialist transformation; precisely because of this characteristic, the contradictions between the working class and them can be handled as internal contradictions of the people. It must be pointed out that the purpose of clarifying the issue of the two-faced nature is not to blacken the face of the national bourgeoisie, the intention is only to clarify the situation of the national bourgeoisie members in the process of self-transformation with the goal of becoming laborers and what efforts are still needed. The national bourgeoisie still has a two-faced nature, and there is still an essential difference with the working class. Pointing out this essential difference is in line with reality and necessary. But pointing out this difference is not the purpose, but a method, the purpose is only to make the work of educating and transforming the national bourgeoisie better, and at the same time, it is also to make the work of transforming the working class better. It is only to carry out the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, starting from the subjective desire for unity, to clarify right and wrong, so as to correctly handle the internal contradictions of the people.

There are contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but they are still internal contradictions of the people.

From the above analysis of the overall changes in the bourgeoisie after the high tide and the internal situation of this class, I feel that Chairman Mao's instruction to handle the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie as internal contradictions of the people is completely based on facts. Therefore, the guideline of Chairman Mao is a long-term (not temporary, and after the class is completely eliminated, it will become the internal contradictions of the working class), comprehensive (not partial) fundamental guideline. Some people think that since it is affirmed as an internal contradiction of the people, it can ignore class contradictions; or, since it is affirmed that class contradictions still exist, it is impossible to handle them as internal contradictions of the people. In this regard, I feel that there are two points that need to be said. First, I think it is groundless to doubt whether the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie can be handled as internal contradictions of the people. The Party has handled the contradictions with the national bourgeoisie throughout the period of the socialist revolution according to the guideline of placing them within the internal contradictions of the people. We only need to compare the policy towards the national bourgeoisie with the policy towards the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to see the obvious difference in principles. In the past few years of handling class contradictions (including the "Five Antis"), under the correct leadership of the Party, generally speaking, have we not solved the problems according to the formula of unity, criticism, and unity? Precisely because the Party that leads the people of the whole country has insisted on this guideline, it has made the originally antagonistic contradictions gradually transform into non-antagonistic contradictions. After the high tide, there are still class contradictions in the issues of asset verification, personnel arrangements, dividends, etc., but they are all handled according to the principles of handling internal contradictions of the people, according to the formula of unity, criticism, and unity, and appropriate solutions are found.

There are not only ideological contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but also contradictions of class interests. This contradiction is an internal contradiction of the people, but it is different from the general contradiction of right and wrong.

Second, since class contradictions are placed within the internal contradictions of the people, how should we correctly deal with class contradictions? Of course, it is wrong to highlight class contradictions, because after the basic completion of the socialist revolution, class contradictions have taken a secondary position, and the focus is on the internal contradictions of the people. However, if class contradictions are avoided and even erased, this is also not in line with the facts. Today, the political unity between the working class and the national bourgeoisie has greatly increased, but there are still differences and contradictions between them. These differences and contradictions are the special nature of the national bourgeoisie as one side of the internal contradictions of the people, and this special nature is an objective existence. Ignoring it would make it impossible to correctly and appropriately handle this part of the internal contradictions of the people. For example, the policy of arranging the national bourgeoisie is called "appointing according to ability and giving appropriate consideration." Why is there an "appropriate consideration" in addition to "appointing according to ability"? This is because there is still a class difference; this shows that there is still a need for distinction in addition to treating everyone equally. The contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, although greatly mitigated, will eventually be completely eliminated, but in our political and social life for a certain period, they are still very obvious. They not only have ideological contradictions but also have contradictions of class interests. For example, the issue of dividends, the workers have opinions about the five percent dividends, and there are also many opinions about the seven-year unchanged dividends, but on the bourgeoisie side, there are people who think that the seven-year five percent dividends are still a loss and advocate extending the dividends for many more years. This should first be affirmed as a contradiction of right and wrong, as an internal contradiction of the people, but is this different from the general contradiction of right and wrong? Obviously, it is different, the difference lies in the fact that this contradiction of right and wrong reflects class contradictions. In handling it, is it better to face the class contradictions or to erase the class contradictions? It is obviously better to face the class contradictions. Of course, in handling internal contradictions of the people, to raise class contradictions is not to expand and consolidate it, but to further solve this contradiction, so as to finally eliminate this contradiction. In the work of education and transformation, in handling class relations, facing class contradictions, conducting specific analyses according to specific situations, and not dealing with them in a general way, will only make our work more in line with specific situations, more conducive to solving problems, and promoting unity.

To handle the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie as internal contradictions of the people, there is an important premise, that is, the bourgeoisie must accept socialist transformation.

In summary: placing the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie within the internal contradictions of the people to handle them is a fundamental guideline that the Party has already affirmed. To implement this guideline, there is an important premise, that is, the national bourgeoisie must accept socialist transformation. This premise is realized, then, although class contradictions exist and are sometimes quite sharp, this guideline can still be implemented. The facts before the high tide have proven this. After the high tide, although class contradictions still exist, they have turned into non-antagonistic contradictions, which is more conducive to implementing this guideline. What is the premise? The premise is that the national bourgeoisie must adhere to the socialist road and socialist standards. The issue is not whether there are class contradictions, nor is it whether to admit the existence of class contradictions, the issue is whether to adhere to the socialist standards. Once this standard is deviated from, the subjective desire for unity has no necessary content, and criticism and self-criticism have no standard for distinguishing right and wrong, thus it is impossible to reach a new basis for unity. Therefore, while affirming the use of the formula of unity, criticism, and unity to handle class contradictions, it is necessary to affirm the socialist standards. Bi Mingqi believes that the inferiority complex of the private sector personnel mainly comes from class relations.

Bi Mingqi, in his written speech, talked about the issues of "Who is the dogmatist?" and "The inferiority complex from the perspective of class." He believes: the inferiority complex of the private sector personnel in various places mainly comes from class relations. He said: "Our socialist development is rapid, and people's thoughts are changing day by day. In such a great transformation, the national bourgeoisie still wears the bourgeoisie hat, so it is impossible to wear it peacefully and comfortably. The higher the ideological awareness, the greater the uneasiness, this is an objective fact, and it is currently the greatest contradiction in ideology, and the so-called inferiority complex in work comes from this."

Bi Mingqi believes: Li Kangnian says that dividends should be calculated at 5%, and with twenty years, the full price can be obtained. To reduce contradictions, from 1958, non-negotiable term deposits should be issued. This view deviates from the actual ideological changes of the national bourgeoisie at present, and goes against the majority of industrial and commercial personnel who want to eliminate class, eliminate class relations, eliminate exploitation, and eliminate the inferiority complex reflected in this symposium (of course, there will also be a few people who hope for the completion of compensation in twenty years). He said: to propose extending the dividends for twenty years, the working class's opposition is natural; the majority of the national bourgeoisie will not accept it, and our national bourgeoisie's children will not agree.

Bi Mingqi said: Comrade Zhang Naiqi said, "Dividends should not be called exploitation, but should be called unearned income, so that industrial and commercial personnel can be calm and composed." Indeed, this statement, I personally feel comfortable, and I believe that other industrial and commercial personnel also feel comfortable. Bi Mingqi also said: "The dividend amount is based on 'asset valuation,' it is unearned income. Indeed, it is different from the exploitation of the capitalist management period. It is still of an exploitative nature. In the process of entering a socialist society, it is something that should not exist. Therefore, my conclusion is: it is of an exploitative nature."

Bi Mingqi said: "Many industrial and commercial personnel no longer have exploitation, they only have wage income, that is, among them, a considerable number of people have a little dividend, but it occupies a very small proportion of their wage income." He believes, "For the above people who occupy a considerable majority in the industrial and commercial circles, they should have the bourgeoisie hat removed, so that they can be separated from the bourgeoisie."

    孙晓村、千家驹、孙起孟在全国工商界座谈会上
    批评种种抵抗改造的论调
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界人士座谈会，昨日举行第十八次座谈。孙晓村、千家驹、孙起孟三人作了长篇的发言，驳斥了种种抵抗改造的错误论调。孙晓村在发言中，分析公私共事关系问题，并对工商界中的骨干分子提出了自己的看法，他认为工商界中的左、中、右三派是客观的存在，这与宗派活动毫无相同之处。千家驹驳斥了某些人否定资产阶级两面性、混淆阶级本质的企图。他指出：在争鸣的时候，不等于说我们可以用资本主义来反对社会主义，更不是说有人提出了反对社会主义的论调，也不让我们加以反驳。孙起孟认为党和政府对于工商业者的改造，在方针政策上是正确的，成绩也是巨大的。目前，民族资产阶级两面性仍然存在。那些把资产阶级两面性说成同工人阶级一样的意见，实质上是否认他们的两面性。
    在会上发言的还有上海市公私合营萃众织厂副经理林炳炜，他根据解放前后的惯例和解放后政府的先行有关法令，提出资方代理人应该参加目前定息的分配，希望解决资方代理人的酬劳金和摘掉帽子的问题，并在民建会、工商联等组织中有一定的代表席位。
    湖南工商联副主任委员兼副秘书长彭六安认为酬劳金问题是资方与资方代理人之间的问题，应该由双方根据具体情况协商解决，不应由政府负担。
    全国工商联常委刘国钧，以亲身经历说明政府赎买政策的英明伟大，他深深体会到思想改造的艰难，他说资产阶级光改头换面不行，必须“洗心涤肺、脱胎换骨”，他又说：我在改造中碰到痛苦的时候，就反躬自问：刘国钧呀，你为什么不洗心涤肺、脱胎换骨？另外，他在会上还谈了国内外贸易问题。
    昨天会上发言的还有民建会常委周士观，他首先建议“工商界月刊”最近准备发表的章乃器一篇文章，不要加上民建副主任的头衔。接着他认为工商界上层人士要注意脱离群众和骄傲自满的倾向。
    昨天的会议上毕鸣岐还作了书面发言。孙晓村说：
    坚决反对任何离开社会主义的言论
    我是民建的一个成员，民建成员中有80％的工商业者，有20％的非工商业者，我是属于20％中间的。近来，工商业者的同志们每听到我们这些非工商业者同志发言或报告时，总批评我们以改造者自居。对于这种批评我们衷心地欢迎，把它看作改进我们工作的一种鞭策。但是，我也要说明，我们并没有以改造者自居，因为我有这样的认识，就是工商业者同志们几年来在社会主义改造的实践中进步得很快，这种实践是我们这些非工商业者没有经历过的，我们应该向这许多进步的工商业者同志们学习；我们也在这样做。至于对于工商业改造的一些看法，我们既是同志就不能不讲，这是另一回事。
    我对于合营企业中公私合作共事关系以及工商界中骨干分子作用的看法。
    公私关系不正常，主要原因是公私双方的思想落后于客观形势。
    我想就我最近所接触到的情况，谈一谈当前合营企业中的公私合作共事关系问题。
      我认为当前合营企业中公私合作共事关系上存在的问题是不少的，这些问题严重地影响着私方人员的积极性的发挥，从企业的生产经营讲来，是十分不利的。
      原因在那里？说起来很多，但我认为最主要的是：自从社会主义改造的高潮以来，中国民族资产阶级在起着深刻的变化，而为数不少的公私双方人员的思想、认识显然落后于这种客观形势，他们用旧眼光来对待新事物，结果是那些合营企业的公私合作共事关系出现了不正常的情况。
    全行业公私合营高潮以后，中国民族资产阶级起了什么变化呢？那就是：这个阶级正在消灭的过程中，它的分子正在由剥削者向劳动者转变的过程中。这是最重要的变化，这种变化在高潮以前是不可能出现的。为了说明这一点，有必要把高潮以后的各种变化具体地分析一下：
    当前民族资产阶级的特殊状态：正在消灭同时又还存在。
    那些变化说明中国民族资产阶级正在消灭的过程中呢？第一，社会主义改造高潮以后，资本主义企业的生产关系发生了根本的变化，中国民族资产阶级交出了企业，交出了三权，离开了生产资料，作为工人阶级同资产阶级对立的物质基础正在开始消灭。第二，发展资本主义的条件已不再存在，中国民族资产阶级作为一个阶级来讲，在国民经济中的作用已经很小。第三，这个阶级正在剧烈地分化，不少人愿意放弃定息，希望自己早日成为一个劳动者。
    既然这样，那么为什么说阶级还存在呢？我认为：中国民族资产阶级作为像过去那样的一个阶级不再存在了，但是他们对生产资料的所有权还表现在他们所持有的股票上，并且以定息的形式获得一部分社会生产物，这样一部分人既不可能是工人，也不可能是农民，也不同于小资产阶级的知识分子，事实上只能是作为正在消灭过程中的资产阶级而存在，所以，阶级还是存在。这句话不仅指思想意识，还包括这种正在消灭中的物质基础。正在消灭而同时又还存在，这就是当前中国民族资产阶级的特殊状态。
    两面性是阶级特性，不是臭不可当的帽子。从没有人说过消极面就是不革命和反革命，就是搞五毒。这种话是不承认两面性的人为了争取群众故意栽在对方身上的。
    那些变化说明工商业者正在由剥削者向劳动者转变的过程中呢？第一，他们被安排在合营企业、合作社企业以至国营企业中担任职务，他们成为这些企业中的公职人员，同时又是私方人员，他们与公方代表和职工群众有了一种新的关系——合作共事关系，同时又是阶级关系。第二，在这些企业里，他们为社会主义做了工作，而且大多数人想贡献才能，把工作做好，例如积极参加社会主义竞赛等；他们也看清楚自己今后唯一的光明前途就是把企业工作做好。上海食品业周凌同志说得好：“工商界要做好事的还是绝对多数”。第三，他们中间大多数人积极学习政治理论，有些人迫切要求学习业务，目的是想改造自己的思想，提高自己的觉悟水平，并且学会本领。第四，他们中间有一部分人，定息是他们的主要收入，但多数人的生活费用的来源主要是依靠工资收入。第五，由于阶级还存在，作为中国民族资产阶级特性的两面性也还存在。说到两面性，有几种误解必须讲清楚：一、两面性是阶级特性，不是臭不可当的一顶帽子，不应当拿“两面派”、“两面三刀”这些话来理解两面性，中国民族资产阶级能够在共产党的领导下光荣地走上和平改造的道路，就是因为有两面性。所以，提两面性不应当发生伤害自尊心的问题。二、说两面性还存在，也就是说两面性正在消灭同时又还存在。说得更具体一点，就是高潮以后，两面性的内容有了很大变化：首先，积极的一面愈来愈扩大，愈来愈成为主要的一面，消极的一面愈来愈缩小；其次，消极的一面主要是思想、意识，但既有思想意识，自然会通过作风行为表现出来，这些思想意识的特点就是强烈地反映出阶级矛盾的性质。三、说高潮以后两面性还存在，从民建去年二中全会起到现在止，就我所知，从来没有人说其中消极的一面在政治上是不革命与反革命，在经济上是搞五毒。这种话是不承认还有两面性的人在论战中为了争取群众故意说对方是这样说的。
    有些公方人员对民族资产阶级的深刻变化认识不足，过分强调阶级关系，不认识企业之中主要的关系是合作共事关系。
      由此可见，这种变化是极为深刻的。如果对于这种变化没有足够的认识，工作不可能不犯错误。我认为不少合营企业中的公方代表和职工对于这种变化是认识不足的，他们以高潮以前、总路线以前甚至五反以前的资本家来看高潮以后的工商业者。就我个人来讲，我是中国民主建国会的一个成员，并且是中央常委会的一个工作人员，我对于这种变化也是认识不足的，因而在工作上也犯了不少的缺点和错误。
    这种认识落后于形势，集中地表现在对合营企业中的双重关系的看法上。有些公方人员在双重关系上过份强调阶级关系，不认识合营企业中主要的关系是合作共事关系，不认识国家把公私双方人员放在一个企业里，目的不是为了开展阶级斗争，而是为了调动一切积极因素，发挥一切力量来搞好企业，所以合作共事关系是主要的，只有搞好合作共事关系，充分尊重私方人员的职权，私方人员才会积极工作，贡献才能，发挥财富的作用。关于阶级关系，是客观的存在，不是任何人所能否定得了的。但今天的合营企业是社会主义性质的企业，任何人在企业中工作不能不服从于企业的任务。因此，应该认识，指出这种阶级关系，对公方人员说来，是提醒他们有贯彻执行党的团结、教育、改造私方人员的政策的责任；对私方人员说来，是提醒他们应当靠拢公方，虚心向工人群众学习，警惕自己还存在的消极的一面，努力进一步自我改造，使自己的思想、作风与所处的社会主义企业的环境日趋一致。双重关系在合营企业中是不会长期存在的，在一定时期之后，阶级关系必然会消灭，那时候，双重关系就变成一种社会主义的合作共事关系。即使在今天，如果处理的好，阶级关系虽未消灭，但也会显著地下降。当然，这是需要公私双方共同努力的。
    只有让私方人员有职有权，才能通过实践，帮助他们进一步自我改造。
    有些公方人员对这种变化，认识不足，在对待私方人员时，以为让他们有职有权，就无异让资产阶级多得了一些东西，工人阶级失掉了一些东西，于是对他们冷淡，把他们放在一边，其结果，私方人员感到受歧视，感到有职无权，感到虽有才能而无处贡献，虽有积极性而无从发挥。这些公方人员自以为这样做是忠心耿耿，为党为国，党性很强，立场很稳，其实是违反了党和政府的方针、政策，做了对党、对国家不利的事，因为只有让私方人员有职有权，才能通过工作实践，帮助他们进一步自我改造；而私方人员如能充分发挥积极性，一定能对国家的社会主义建设作出贡献。我建议合营企业中的公方人员，应当好好地总结一下一年多来公私合作共事关系的经验和教训。就我们所知道的，凡是搞得好的企业，既有利于建设，又有利于改造；而搞得不好的，则给党带来了政治上的损失：一是企业的生产经营受影响；二是私方人员的积极性受挫折；三是使私方人员怀疑党的政策是一回事，执行起来又是一回事。这种政治上的损失是很大的。
    不错，公私关系的不正常，除了有些是由于企业中的制度存在着问题外，从公方人员讲来，有时还由于公方人员经验不足（这一点相当普遍），以及有些人作风不良，但是最重要的还是对工商业者的巨大变化这一事实认识不足。我认为党和政府、工会应当大力帮助公方人员和职工群众提高这方面的认识，使他们理解如对工商业者的进步没有足够的认识，那就无异否认了党的教育的伟大成绩。南京有一位民建会员说：“只有阶级教育，没有阶级正在转变的教育”。这句话值得我们思考的。
    也有许多公方代表在这方面工作得很好的，我在最近视察时就看到好几个例子，这里不谈。
    有些私方人员一听到“改造”“剥削”“两面性”等字句就起反感，他们忘记了自己还在由剥削者转变为劳动者的路上，距离目的地还相当远。
    以上说的是公方。对于高潮以后中国民族资产阶级的变化以及它的分子的变化，私方人员的认识是不是也有不足呢？肯定的说，也是认识不足。这种认识不足表现在两个方面：一方面，对于企业不再像私营时期那样无微不至地关心，在企业里不敢当家作主，工作不够主动，有自卑感，有作客思想，政治责任感不强，对于有职无权不敢据理力争，对于党和政府的政策将信将疑，抱定“干门前杯”、“做一日和尚撞一日钟”的宗旨。这种情况的出现虽与公方代表的态度、作风，以至企业中有些制度有关，与民建会的教育、帮助不够，代表合法利益不够有关，但从私方人员讲来，不能不说是一个思想认识问题，也就是说，由于没有清楚地认识自己已经离开进行剥削的物质基础，国家已经把自己当做公职人员，要求发挥财富作用，自己只要积极工作，努力改造，就无愧于做一个社会主义建设的工作者。
    另一方面：认为企业既然交出，自己的改造已经差不多了，没有什么两面性了，如说有，也只是先进与落后，那是工人阶级也有的，所以不需要向工人阶级学习了，不应该再提阶级关系了。最近有这样一种情绪，就是一听到“进一步自我改造”、“资产阶级思想”、以及“剥削”、“两面性”等字句就起反感。这种情况的出现是值得研究的，其中有由于自己的进步没有得到应有的重视，以及宣教工作的缺点所引起的成分，但主要是骄傲自满的表现。有的工商界同志忘记了高潮的到来除了党的教育与工商业者的爱国思想和政治觉悟这两个因素外，还有中国民族资产阶级当时所处的政治和经济的环境以及党和政府的利用、限制、改造政策所起的作用，没有这些，仅仅依靠教育的力量与爱国思想还是不可能有高潮的；忘记了资产阶级还存在，自己还在由剥削者转变为劳动者的路上，距离目的地还相当远，自我改造还有一段艰苦的过程。所以这显然也是严重的思想认识问题。
    不承认两面性，不愿意进一步改造，把自己说得已经和工人阶级一样，正是对原来阶级的留恋，正是消极的表现。
    公方人员之所以思想认识落后于形势，是和他们的宗派主义情绪和思想上的主观主义、教条主义分不开的。私方人员之所以对自己的阶级和分子的变化认识不足或认识不当，是受到阶级性的局限，这种自卑与自大实质上就是两面性中消极一面的表现。不承认还有两面性，不愿意进一步自我改造，怕听人批评资产阶级思想，把自己说得现在已经和工人阶级一样，正是对于自己原来的阶级的留恋，以及两面性还存在的反映。
    工商界同志必须善于区别各种论点，有些论点虽合乎自己的感情，却是危险的毒草。
    如果上面的分析还与事实相符的话，那末为了搞好公私合作共事关系，发挥私方人员的积极性，除了公方人员必须迅速提高自己的思想认识，改进工作作风和方法外，私方人员也必须认真地进行自我改造，克服目前正在滋长的放松自我改造的情况。工商界的同志要认识思想改造是长期的、艰苦的过程，破资本主义、立社会主义是一场反复的、痛苦的自我斗争，因此，必须善于区别那些论点是思想改造的花园中的香花，那些论点虽然很迎合自己的情感，却是危险的毒草。民建过去代表工商界合法利益的工作做得不够，教育工作也做得不够，今后应该代表的必须积极代表，不要只限于反映一番，而对于思想教育工作，则必须认真地检查过去的缺点，用与工商界同命运共呼吸的精神，帮助工商界在思想改造的道路上迅速前进。至于改进公私关系的具体措施和办法，大家谈得很多，我不想再谈了。
    骨干分子如果不能团结中间以至落后层，以自己的模范行动带动他们向中、向左转变，这样的骨干分子，就不成其为骨干分子。
    中国民主建国会是以培养工商业者会员成为工商界中的骨干分子为自己的工作方针的，几年来的经验证明，这一工作方针是正确的。但当前的情况怎样呢？骨干分子相当苦闷，对自己的作用认识不足，群众对骨干分子有意见，有的人把骨干分子与宗派活动这两件事联系起来，因此，我想为工商界中的骨干分子讲几句话。
    为什么非要培养骨干分子不可呢？骨干分子究竟能起什么作用呢？在一个社会里，一个阶级里，一个集团里，甚至在一个有共同信仰的政党里，对于客观真理的认识以及对待客观真理的态度不是每个成员都一样的。古人说：“闻道有先后”，大概就是这个意思。既然不一样，就自然会分出先进的、中间的、落后的，三类人。这是客观规律，工商界也不例外。这样讲，丝毫没有轻视中间落后层的意思，要知道，左、中、右不是固定不变的，今天的中明天可以变成左，今天的右，明天可以变成中，所以，骨干分子的责任就是要团结中间以至落后层，以自己的模范行动带动他们向左、向中转变。骨干分子如果骄傲自满、脱离群众，不能起这样的作用，那正如李维汉部长所说的（大意如此）这样的骨干分子是无血无肉的，只是一堆枯骨而已，那也就不成其为骨干分子了。骨干分子也不可能什么都是先进的，所以他们还要善于向人学习，要认真地克服自己落后的一面，如果不谦虚，不努力，今天是骨干分子，明天可能变成中间以至落后分子。总之，骨干分子不是什么荣誉的称号，作为骨干分子，只有多作工作的义务，而没有自高自大的权利。
    从工商界接受社会主义改造这段历史来看，骨干分子起的作用是相当巨大的，远在“三反”“五反”以前，工商界中就有一些先进分子对于社会主义感到兴趣，相信党的方针、政策，这些同志在“五反”运动中以及后来在总路线宣布时，都起了破除顾虑、带头先行的良好作用。1955年冬，听了毛主席关于认识社会发展规律，掌握自己命运的伟大指示以后，先在全国工商联的会议上，后在各地的人代会上，也是许多骨干分子带头进行了自我检讨。那时，工商界中先进的人数愈来愈多，这种形势对于高潮的到来，不能说不是一种推动力量，由此可见，工商界中有左、中、右是客观存在的事实，而由于党领导民建和工商联掌握了这个客观规律，培养骨干分子来带动中间，影响落后，不断地扩大左派与中间的队伍，终于顺利地推动全体工商界掀起了全行业公私合营的高潮。
    在肯定骨干分子的作用的同时，也必须指出骨干分子的缺点。根据不少工商界同志的反映，就这一年多的情况来说，许多骨干分子有脱离群众的倾向，不关心群众的工作、学习与生活，不敢积极地代表群众的合法利益与合理要求，他们与群众的共同语言渐渐缺少了，这是很不好的事。更严重的是有的骨干分子把自己放在群众之上，以改造者自居，造成与群众对立的局面。在这些问题，我认为统战部、民建会是有一定责任的，这就是对骨干分子的关心、帮助不够，对他们的缺点和错误批评不够，对他们的社会活动与岗位工作的矛盾没有及时予以解决。
    工商界中有左、中、右是客观存在，它与宗派活动毫无相同之处。有些人同党的看法比较一致，当然就同党员多一些接触。在这一点上，不能同意章乃器对统战部的批评。
    左、中、右的客观存在，以及民建会培养骨干分子的工作与宗派活动是毫无相同之处的。工商界中，民建内部有没有人搞宗派活动，那应该严肃地检查。但工商界中既有左、中、右，那么民建在进行工作时，为了了解情况，作好工作，有时分别与这些人或那些人开会商量，是不是宗派活动呢？当然不是。就以民建内部来讲，在某一些问题上，也是有左、中、右的分别的，有时这几位同志研究某一个问题，或者为了帮助另外几位同志而进行一些商讨，这也是不可少的。那么，这种活动是不是也是宗派活动呢？当然不是。鉴别宗派活动要看是否为了社会主义的根本利益，宗派活动是为了少数人的私利，是无原则地排斥他人。做法上是不择手段的。作为骨干分子，宗派主义情绪也是不应该有的，有了这种情绪，就会脱离群众，更何况宗派活动。我们反对宗派主义情绪，更反对宗派活动。任何组织内，不容许有宗派活动，宗派活动是破坏组织的。所以，看一个问题应该从实质、内容上来看，而不能只看形式、表面，否则几个同志平常接触多一点就被认为是宗派活动，那就是自己带着宗派眼光看人，不信任同志，对工作是很不利的。
    工商界中间，民建成员中间既然有左、中、右，那末在某一个问题上，有一些人的看法与党的方针、政策比较一致，与参加在民建、工商联工作的党员的看法比较一致，那也是很可能发生的。既然意见比较一致，当然要多一点接触，而接触的内容无疑地就是想把他们认为对的主张、看法扩展开去，影响他人。这能说是宗派活动吗？这能说是统战部在参加宗派活动吗？这种看法显然是错误的。说到这儿，我要说明，在这一问题上，我是不同意章乃器同志在“从墙和沟的思想基础说起”那篇文章中对统战部的批评的。我认为民主党派与统战部的关系既可以有组织对组织的来往，也可以有成员对成员的来往，何况组织来往也是不免要通过个人的。对于上一点我想没有人认为不应该的。问题在于民主党派中的成员和工作人员是不是也可以请求统战部的同志就工作问题以及对方针、政策的认识问题交换意见？我认为完全可以。民主党派的成员请求与统战部谈话，我想统战部没有理由不答允的。反过来说，统战部也完全可以约请民主党派内的一些同志交换工作上的意见。这样作，对于民主党派的工作只有好处，没有坏处。过去做得太少，不是太多。统战部既然没有限制那一些人可以来交换意见，那一些人不能来；而对民主党派的成员来说，这种接触又只是对他个人的帮助，没有任何对他个人以至对组织的约束力。我想不出这种来往与宗派活动有什么相同之处？民主党派中可能有个别成员作风不良，假借统战部的名义来压人，有的人甚至搞宗派活动，那是应该反对的。但这是另一件事，如果因为个别现象，就把所有这种来往说成宗派活动，甚至说统战部在参加宗派活动，那就是把民主党派与统战部的关系限制在组织对组织的接触上，其他来往都变成有宗派活动的嫌疑，这不但与事实不符，而且阻塞了民主党派与统战部的正常来往。
    总之，作为骨干分子，应该严格地要求自己，克服一切自高自大，以改造者自居，脱离群众的作风，应该无微不至地团结帮助中间，带动落后。这是一方面。另一方面，我们对于骨干分子的作用也应有足够的估计，对他们的困难有足够的同情，尤其不应该以自己的宗派主义情绪来看他们，这样做，对于团结大家共同前进是没有好处的，这种重大的是非问题是不容许混淆的。
    对任何离开社会主义的言论，不论表达的方式怎样，都应该坚决反对。
    最后，我还想说几句话。我们帮助党整风，有一个立场问题。这个立场就是“一切为了社会主义”。正是为了更好地团结全国人民建设社会主义，党所以要整风，要除三害，我们所以要揭露人民内部矛盾，帮助党整风。因此，只要有利于社会主义，有利于巩固和加强党在全国人民和社会主义建设中的核心领导作用，不论多么尖锐的批评都应该受到欢迎，但对任何离开社会主义的言论，不论表达的方式怎样，都应该坚决反对。最近这一大放大鸣期间，我们工商界和民建同志对党提出了不少的批评和意见，我个人认为这些批评和意见，绝大部分是从“一切为了社会主义”的立场出发的。但是也有一部分批评和意见是错误的，对于工商业者的进一步自我改造不利的，其中有些意见甚至在不同程度上表现出对党、对工人阶级、对马列主义、对社会主义这些根本问题上的极端错误的态度的。对这些言论，我们一定要本着团结——批评——团结的伟大公式，发挥争鸣的精神，讲清道理，明辨是非。同志们，这是一个严肃的任务。千家驹说：
    不能在反教条主义的幌子下，
    贩运资本主义的私货
    自从我在上次工商界座谈会发言之后，许多工商界朋友对我的发言提出了不同的意见，这是好的。因为经过争论，可以把问题弄得更清楚，真理愈辩而愈明，我们不用害怕别人的批评，应该欢迎别人的反对意见，这可以帮助我们从各种不同的角度来看问题。只许我说，不许你鸣，甚至认为有人提了不同意见，就是压制人，这种态度是不好的。我们现在帮助党整风，就等于给党治病，对于党在资本主义工商业改造方面工作上的缺点，工商界可以开药方，非工商界也可以开药方，通过辩论，就可以找出真正的病源，从而对症下药，倘有不同意见，就给提不同意见的人戴一顶教条主义的帽子，这种办法我看是不妥当的。
    公私关系，和工商业者是否有两面性，是两类性质不同的问题，不能混为一谈。
    我想讲的是两个问题：
    第一、我认为必须区别两类性质不同的问题。今天在有些合营企业中，公私关系不够正常，某些私方代表有职无权，积极性没有充分发挥出来。要解决这一类的问题，需要制订一系列的制度，要在合营企业中进行赎买政策和统战政策的教育。至于工商业者是不是还有两面性，是否需要继续进行改造，这是属于另一类性质的问题。这两类问题是有关联的，但不能混为一谈。
    在合营企业中改善公私关系的方法，我基本上同意盛丕老的意见，应把合营企业里的决策工作和执行工作在职权上划分开来，凡是重大问题，原则性问题的决策工作应由企业的党、政（包括私方行政人员）、工、团建立适当的会议制度，在党和公方代表统一领导下，集体作出决定。至于决策的贯彻执行以及日常事务工作，则由企业的行政部门按照行政的职别办事。这种办法，一方面保证了公方对企业的领导权，一方面可以消除目前公私共事关系中存在的权责不清的现象，使私方人员可以有职有权有责。
    在合营企业中，不仅有公私关系，还存在着私方人员与职工群众的关系。我上次发言：“劳资双方过去有墙，……这道墙所以筑成，资方应负很大责任，今天资方想拆墙，而工人还没有拆，或没有完全拆，这也是很自然的，私方应有耐性。”这几句话引起了许多工商业者的反感，我想这是出于一种误会。难道说劳资之间没有历史的阶级仇恨吗？难道说这种阶级仇恨应归咎于劳方吗？要把这道墙彻底拆掉，资方应有最大的耐心，从工作上和生活上去改变职工群众的观感，这几句话怎么能被理解为要工商界“安心于不公平”呢？应该知道，不少职工群众对国家的赎买政策是有抵触情绪的，他们认为政府今天太照顾资本家了。陈云副总理去年12月15日在工商联大会上曾经说过：“职工和私方的关系是可以改善的，但是也要估计到历史上遗留下来的对立情绪，并不是很快可以转变的。我们的任务就是要从各方面来进行工作，缩小这个距离。”又指出：“政府和工会应该对职工广泛进行赎买政策的教育……私方人员在改进公私关系中采取积极、正确的态度，所谓积极，就是不要但求无过，而是要不怕困难，不怕碰钉子，积极工作。”陈云副总理这几句话，在今天看来，还是正确的。
    否认两面性不等于两面性就不存在。有的人既要拿定息，又要摘帽子，这不是两面性的表现又是什么？
    要改进公私共事关系和发挥私方人员的积极性，我认为应该从加强对职工群众和公方人员的赎买政策的教育、建立公私共事关系的一套制度、私方人员以积极正确的态度对待工作这三方面齐头并进，而不是否定两面性，否定定息是剥削，这样是不能解决问题的。否定两面性不等于两面性不存在，否定阶级关系不等于阶级关系已经消灭。
    对于两面性，我们应该根据历史情况作具体分析。大家知道，在新民主主义革命阶段的两面性与社会主义革命阶段的两面性的表现是不同的，在全行业合营以后与合营以前两面性的内容也是不相同的。谁也没有说过今天民族资产阶级的两面性还是指经济上的“五毒”或政治上的不革命或反革命，然而有人却一口这样咬定，并据此而否认两面性的存在。
    同时，我们也一再指出：两面性中积极一面是主要的一面，而且正在不断地扩大和发展，消极一面是次要一面，它正在缩小以至逐步消灭，所谓积极一面和消极一面主要是指对社会主义的态度而言，而且主要表现在意识形态上，但是竟有人认为说有两面性就是强调消极一面，就会打击私方人员的积极性，这不是无的放矢是什么呢？
    我们还认为：阶级正处在剧烈的分化之中，工商业者是在逐步向着劳动者转化的过程之中，同时两面性在工商界分子中，存在的程度也是极不平衡的，有多有少，表现形式也不相同，但从大量观察，即作为一个阶级来观察，两面性总还是存在的。我上次说，有人反映“合营前是小国之君，合营后是大国之臣”等等，这不过举一个例子来说明，从没有说过所有的工商业者都是如此，然而有人竟认为这是以个别例子来概括全部。
    我这里还要补充的是，工商业者的消极一面，从这次的大放大鸣中证明比我们过去所想像的似乎还要严重一些。资本主义与社会主义两条道路的斗争是以社会主义改造的决定性胜利而完全解决了；但资本主义思想与社会主义思想的斗争看来还没有完全解决，不是现在还有人公开主张官僚主义比资本主义还要可怕吗？这说明对资产阶级的思想教育是一个艰巨的长期性的工作。过去我们总以为否定两面性，否认定息是剥削仅仅是某一二个人的主张，在这次争鸣中不是证明他们还有相当大的市场吗？在争鸣中还暴露出有的工商业者定息是要拿的，资产阶级的帽子不要再戴了，这不是两面性的一种表现是什么呢？
    由批评缺点而否定我国对资本主义工商业改造的一些基本原理，在反教条主义的幌子下大量贩运资本主义的私货，是完全错误的。
    第二个问题我想谈的是关于帮助党整风和工商业者进一步改造问题。工商业者帮助党来整风，其目的是要求工商业者揭发党对资本主义工商业改造工作中的缺点，暴露矛盾，以改进工作。这是一件事情。为了进一步把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者，工商业者需要继续学习，进一步接受改造，这是又一件事情。不要混为一谈。国家对资本主义工商业改造工作中是有缺点的，我在上次发言中也曾提出过，特别是关于中小工商业者摘帽子的问题，政府没有及时定出适当的措施来贯彻执行，从我来说，作为中央工商行政管理局负责人之一，也没有积极地提出意见，这是应该受到批评的。但如果由批评缺点而否定了我国对资本主义工商业改造的一些基本原理，甚至把马克思主义的一些基本原则也加以否定，概称之为教条主义，而加以反对，甚至在反教条主义的幌子下，大量贩运资本主义的私货，那更是完全错误的。我们要反对教条主义，但不是反对马克思主义的基本原则，以修正主义和资本主义来反对教条主义，是我们所绝对不能同意的。例如关于定息问题，有人认为定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入，这就令人奇怪了。基于生产资料所有权而来的不劳而获的收入，不是剥削是什么呢？这种说法的目的不外是要根本否定我国目前仍有资产阶级作为一个残余的剥削阶级而存在。这种理论如果成立，那我们一切的改造工作，即要进一步把他们改造成为自食其力的劳动者的任务也变成无的放矢了。这与马克思主义是毫无相同之处的。
    又如有人说，资产阶级有两面性，那么工人阶级也有两面性。又说，资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子没有本质区别，（能转化不等于说没有本质区别，正如地主可以转化为农民，但能够说农民同地主没有本质区别吗！）这那里算得上理论呢？这是诡辩或故弄玄虚吧了。
    我上次说在社会主义革命阶段，必须消灭资本主义所有制。本应没收，照理亦要没收，这是说按照社会主义革命的任务来说，是应该这样做的，但由于中国具体的历史条件，我们不采取没收而采取赎买的形式。赎买是消灭生产资料资本家所有制的一种手段，它同和平改造是一个事物的两面，是一回事不是两回事。在马克思主义者看来，资本家所有制决不是神圣不可侵犯的，这和资产阶级的改良主义的理论有本质的区别。现在有人提议要赎买到底，即付定息二十年（甚至有提出三十五年的），这种思想不应加以批评吗？
    不错，在争鸣的时候，什么问题都可以提出来讨论，但不等于说我们可以用资本主义来反对社会主义，更不是说，即使有人提出了反对社会主义的论调（自然今天公开提出反对社会主义的人是不会有的，它总是改头换面以各种不同面目出现），也不许我们加以反驳。认为一加反驳，就是压制争鸣，就是教条主义，这是什么逻辑呢？应该认识争鸣就是要允许有不同的意见，互相辩论，有理说倒人，教条主义的帽子是吓不倒人的。
    李康年的建议是牢牢的站在资产阶级的立场上。从他的建议中可以看出资产阶级思想是怎样顽强地在表现自己。
    最后我想就李康年先生的发言说几句话。关于李康年先生主张定息二十年，我上次发言曾提出批评认为这是资产阶级消极性的一种表现。最近李康年先生在发言中说我没有看过他的建议原文，的确这是事实。在李康年发言后，我曾仔细读了他在上海市第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上“关于定息的建议书”、“关于定息建议书的补充理由”以及“从我学习哲学以后来看政府用和平方针改造工商企业采取赎买政策实施定息办法问题”等文，又听了他这次的发言。我认为上次的批评基本上是正确的，虽然还不够全面。李康年先生的建议虽也包含有少许合理的东西（例如简化手续），但总的精神是牢牢的站在资产阶级的立场，给资产阶级的打算真可说是无微不至。他不仅坚持赎买“必须付足二十二亿元”，而且这二十二亿元的赎买存单是从1958年1月1日起发行的，1956、1957两年已经付出的二亿二千万元还不算在内，国家多出的二亿二千万元作为对资方代理人（包括董事监察人等等在内）进行赎买，名叫资方代理人的“酬奖”和“对需要照顾的资产阶级分子给予一次的慰籍金”，以慰籍他们“确由阶级斗争之故遭遇的损失”。他不但断章取义的曲解了毛主席在全国工商联代表会议上的讲话，曲解了人民日报1955年11月22日的社论，还歪曲了马克思所说，赎买对于无产阶级将会是最便宜不过的一句话（按马克思此语出自恩格斯“法德农民问题”一文，原文是：“我们并不认为，赎买办法在任何情况下都是不容许的；马克思曾向我讲过〔并且讲过多次〕，他的意见，假如我们能用赎买方法完全摆脱这个匪帮，那对于我们就会是最便宜不过的了”。）在李康年先生看来，赎买既然对无产阶级“最便宜不过”，对资产阶级当然是“吃亏”不过了，“可是（无产阶级）心中还有些不服气，他们以为资本家究竟太便宜了”。这在他看来，真可说是“是非倒置”了。李康年先生在座谈会中建议把他的建议全文由人民出版社出版，交全国基层讨论，我个人倒是同意李康年先生这个建议的（只要纸张不太紧张的话）。把李康年先生的建议书印发全国讨论，老实说，这个建议是决不可能被接受的，因为这对工商业者改造不利，对社会主义不利。但从他的建议中可以看出资产阶级思想是怎样顽强地在表现自己，使工商界认识到思想改造是怎么一种艰苦的工作，这对破资本主义，立社会主义是会大有帮助的。
    社会主义的基本原则是不能动摇的。一切不利于工商界自我改造、自我教育的言论，应该加以批判。
    现在党提出了“工作整风两不误”，我也愿意对工商界提出“改造整风两不误”的意见。为了帮助党整风，我们应该把各种不同意见都尽量说出来，但是社会主义的基本原则是不能动摇的，一切不利于工商界自我改造、自我教育的言论是应该加以批判的。我们要实事求是，不要哗众取宠。工商界今日的心情我们是可以理解的，他们有的人有一肚子委屈，要以一吐为快，但不要以感情代替了理智，诉苦不能代替分析。有人说，我们是给党整风，而不是给工商业者整风，但给党整风的目的是为了改进党的工作，以有利于工商业者进一步的改造，是为了建设社会主义，而绝不是用资本主义思想来代替社会主义思想。离开了这一基本方针的看法和做法，我认为是错误的，为了工商业者本身的利益，应该加以避免。
    孙起孟说：离开社会主义的准则，团结的愿望就没有内容
    改造的方针、政策是正确的，工作成就是根本的、主要的。
    党这一次整风，主要是要反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。我们帮助党整风，在私营工商业的社会主义改造方面，同样地也就是要反对这三个主义。从揭发出来的现象看，毛病是很多的。领导中国人民取得民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利的党，竟有这么多的毛病，这是怎么一回事呢？是工作中的错误？还是路线、方针的错误？还是兼而有之？我以为应当有一个基本估计。对此，我同意有些同志在发言中的看法：党在私营工商业的社会主义改造方面的方针、政策是正确的，是符合我国的实际情况的；工作中基本上实现了方针、任务，工作成就是根本的一面，主要的一面。同时又有不少的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。此所以在社会主义改造伟大胜利的形势下还存在着不少的问题，造成了不应有的损失。有了毛病，就需要揭发出来，以利于辨明是非，改正错误，巩固已经取得的成就，不断地发展和巩固社会主义事业。
    有些党员和干部对民族资产阶级在社会变革中的变化的估计，有“左”的毛病。
    高潮以后，社会主义革命基本完成了，而在我们现实生活中，清清楚楚的，民族资产阶级还存在，那么，怎样去认识这个阶级在社会大变革中的变化？提出这样的问题，是很自然的。在估计上如果有偏差，势必影响到在处理阶级关系上出偏差，因此这个问题有着很大的现实意义。我同意有些同志在发言中所提出的，党员和干部中间，在估计上存在着“左”的毛病，“左”的表现和恶果，同志们已经讲得很多，我只想补充说一说“左”的毛病主要出在那几个问题上。
    第一是出在对于民族资产阶级在高潮以后社会地位的重大变化认识不够甚至无所认识。高潮以后，利用生产资料的占有进行剥削的资本主义生产方式，在我国社会生活中间已经消灭了，资本家在合营企业里，不管他们自觉与否，是为社会主义而工作，因此把他们还当作像高潮以前那样的资本家来看待，是脱离实际的。
    第二、毛病出在对于民族资产阶级在社会大变革以后的积极作用还有估计不足的地方。民族资产阶级是“财富”，这样的话对于把他们看作“包袱”的思想起了澄清的作用，同时也鼓舞了他们的积极性。但是，一般的也还是主要地看到了他们在社会主义改造中的作用和在社会上的影响，而对于他们的掌握了现代文化和现代企业的技术知识和管理知识，则估计不足甚至无所认识。不少人没有看到，由于生产关系的根本变化，资本家原来用以进行资本主义剥削或者还不是为社会主义服务的文化、技术、知识，现在已经不能不依附在社会主义的经济基础上而为它服务了，因此，资方人员的本领也就不能不成为社会主义建设中的一项财富。不看到这一点，就不懂得充分使用资方人员，发挥他们的所长，帮助他们学习和改造，帮助他们做好工作，既是适应了民族资产阶级的愿望，又是符合了工人阶级的利益。不看到这一点，就不懂得，安排了资方人员而不是很好地使用他们，让他们作出贡献，不仅是资方人员会有意见，对于工人阶级也是不利的。不看到这一点，就不懂得为什么要向资本家学习和向他们学习什么。关于民族资产阶级分子对社会主义建设这样的积极作用，有不少人是估计偏低，认识不足的。
    第三、毛病出在对于民族资产阶级分子的情况，特别是高潮以后他们的变化，缺乏具体的分析，没有把什么是好的、什么是不好的实事求是地区别开来，恰如其分地给以肯定或者否定。笼统地肯定固然不好，笼统地否定，也会伤害许多人的心。没有看到，工商界中有不少人的心是向着社会主义的，向着共产党的，而且这样的人只会日益增多，而不会日益减少。有一部分人，从表面上看，平平淡淡，在某些问题上，甚且保持着比较保守的观点，但是他们的爱国的心是不落人后的，对于企业里的工作是有着深厚的感情的，愿意拿出本领来贡献给国家的心也是坚定的。估计“左”了，笼统的否定工商界的积极方面，就会伤害这些人的积极性。
    形成“左”的毛病有多方面的原因，原因之一在于民族资产阶级不是简单地只有好的或者坏的一面，而是同时具有两面，这就是在我国条件下为他们的阶级地位所决定的两面性。两面性是比较不好掌握的，一分析不好，一笼统，不是偏于这一面，就是偏于那一面，也就是，容易偏“左”或者偏右。
    目前工商业者又是资本家，又是劳动者。这种两重身份反映在政治立场和思想作风上，就是有社会主义一面，又有资本主义一面。
    关于两面性问题，已经经过一个相当长时间的讨论，这次座谈会上，也有很多位同志对此发表了意见。可以不可以说，经过讨论以后，同意民族资产阶级在高潮以后还有两面性的人在增多起来，也就是，对这个问题认识的一致面在扩大起来。当然，两面性到底有没有，还可以研究，现在更需要进一步讨论的可能是民族资产阶级的两面性在高潮以后的变化问题。有没有变化？如果有变化，怎样变化？关于这一点，我讲一点不成熟的意见，请同志们指正。
    中国民族资产阶级的两面性，如毛主席在“中国社会各阶级的分析”中所指出的，是他们对于中国革命的矛盾态度。这种矛盾态度是为他们的阶级地位和中国的社会条件所决定的。因此，随着革命形势的发展，随着民族资产阶级经济、社会地位的变化，他们的两面性也就必然要发生变化，不变化是不可能的。刘少奇同志在“八大”政治报告中，对他们的两面性从民主革命时期到社会主义革命时期的变化，作了概括的叙述，明确地指出他们的两面性是有变化的，是随着社会的发展而变化的。现在的特点是已经进入社会主义的领域，但是还保持着资本主义的东西。对他们的两面性的变化起作用的有两个因素，一个是他们的经济、社会地位，另一个是他们的个人改造。从他们的经济、社会地位观察，他们已经不再是企业私营时期那样的资本家了，他们的身分已经发生了重大的变化。从他们还有剥削收入等等情况来看，不能不说他们还是资本家（有部分个体劳动者参加了公私合营成为定息户，这样的人当然并不因为拿定息而变成资本家。）；从他们在企业、机关中的工作是为社会主义服务的情况来看，不能不说他们开始成为劳动者。因此，不能简单地、抽象地把他们叫做资本家或者劳动者，而只能辩证地，也就是科学地把他们叫做既是资本家又是劳动者。听来好像是矛盾的，但这样的说法可能反映着客观的事实。他们这样的社会地位决定了他们不可能不具有两面性，反映在政治立场和思想作风上，就是有劳动者的一面，也即社会主义的一面，又有资本家的一面，也即资本主义的一面。
    民族资产阶级分子的两面性，到达了现在的境地，是否停滞不变了呢？不是的，他们的外部条件和内部条件都不容许不变，而且正在变化之中。作为一个阶级特征的民族资产阶级两面性，就现在的情况看，大体上说，可能有三种情况：一种是，社会主义的一面（主要指他们的经济生活和政治立场）增长得很多、很快，第二种是，基本上还是资本主义的一面，社会主义的一面增长得很少、很慢，甚至没有增长，第三种是中间状态。这里所讲的政治立场，主要是指他们对社会主义的政治态度。政治立场如何，当然同他们的经济生活有莫大的关系，但是自我改造也起着极大的作用。上述的三种情况又不会是一成不变的。可以不可以这样的估计，总的趋势是向第一种情况逐步发展，但是也应当看到，在向劳动者转化的过程中始终保持着主要是资产阶级政治立场、思想作风或者变化极少的人不会没有。
    是什么因素使民族资产阶级的成员中间发生了上述三种不同的情况呢？又是什么因素使上述的三种情况向着第一种情况发展变化呢？关键在于教育改造，在于继续进行自我教育，自我改造。两面性问题讨论之所以有价值，就在于能够使我们明确工商界今后教育改造的方针（把这一项工作放在适当的地位上）和任务（要解决什么问题，同劳动人民的改造在内容上有什么不同等等）。
    总起来说，我的看法有这样的五点：
    民族资产阶级有两面性。把这种两面性说成同工人阶级有先进和落后的两面性一样的人，实际上是否认他们有两面性。
    第一、中国民族资产阶级在高潮以后有没有两面性，我以为，有两面性而不是没有两面性。
    第二、两面性有无变化？怎样变化？两面性从来不是一成不变的。高潮以后，变化更加显著而重大。他们的两面性已经变为：社会地位、政治立场、思想作风上一方面还是资本家，另一方面又已经开始向劳动者方面逐步转化。这样的两面性还会变下去，直到它的消灭。因此，不能把民族资产阶级的两面性说成是同工人阶级一样的先进和落后的两面性。说民族资产阶级只有先进和落后的两面性的人，在实质上是否认他们有两面性。至于说两面性中的消极一面，在高潮以后还是指“五毒”，那显然是出于误解。如果工商界中确实有人有这样的误解，我们大家有责任向他们解释清楚。
    第三、两面性今后变化的特点怎样？总的趋势是，资本家的一面也即资本主义的一面继续逐步缩小，劳动者的一面，也即社会主义的一面继续逐步增长。而在民族资产阶级成员中间，客观地存在着三种情况：进步很多、很快的，进步很少、很慢的和中间状态。不承认民族资产阶级内部这样的变化，也就很难理解两面性发展变化的整个趋势。
    第四、对两面性变化起作用的有两个重要因素，一是民族资产阶级分子的经济、社会地位，一是他们的个人改造。在生产关系发生了根本变化以后，个人改造对于两面性的变化就有突出的作用。
    两面性不是用来压服人的帽子。两面性是使民族资产阶级同官僚资产阶级区别开来的特点。正因为有两面性，民族资产阶级才成为工人阶级团结、争取的对象。
    第五、两面性好不好？这要看同什么比较。拿来同工人阶级比，自然不好，因为两面性里面还有资本家的一面，也即资本主义的一面。但是如果以中国民族资产阶级同资本主义国家的资产阶级相比，有两面性正是它的好处，就以它自身的历史和现实的情况相比较，也应当看到它的有很大变化、很大进步的这一面。由于有不好的一面，所以还有改造的任务，奋斗的目标；由于有好的一面，因此毋庸自卑，而是要以很大的信心和努力来进行自我改造。
    附带在这里说一说两面性是不是一顶帽子的问题。用语恰当不恰当是次要的问题，重要的在于这里头所代表的一种看法和所反映的一种情况。人们听了这样的话会想到：既然是人家给我扣上的帽子，那还有什么研究的必要呢？其实，工商界中很多人都知道，两面性正是使民族资产阶级同官僚资产阶级区别开来的特点。官僚资产阶级没有两面性，因此只能当作革命对象而打倒。正因为有了两面性这个特点，民族资产阶级才成为工人阶级团结、争取的对象，才成为工人阶级的同盟军；正因为有了这个特点，他们才有接受社会主义改造的可能；正因为有了这个特点，工人阶级同他们的矛盾，才有当作人民内部矛盾来处理的可能。必须指出，所以要把两面性的问题弄清楚，决不是为了把民族资产阶级的脸搽黑，用意只能是为了弄清楚民族资产阶级分子在以变成劳动者为目标的自我改造过程中达到了怎样的境地和还需要作些什么努力。中国民族资产阶级还有两面性，同工人阶级还有本质上的区别，指出这样的本质区别是符合实际的、必要的。但指明这个区别不是目的，而是一种方法，目的无非是使民族资产阶级分子的教育改造工作做得更好，同时也是为了使劳动人民的改造工作做得更好。无非是贯彻毛主席所指示的精神，从团结的主观愿望出发，分清是非，以利于正确地处理人民内部的矛盾。
    工人阶级同资产阶级之间存在矛盾，但仍然是人民内部的矛盾。
    从上述的对于整个资产阶级在高潮后的变化，以及这个阶级的内部情况等等来分析，我体会到毛主席将工人阶级同民族资产阶级矛盾放在人民内部矛盾之中来处理的指示是完全有事实根据的。因此，毛主席指示的方针，就将是一个长期适用的（不是一时的，到阶级完全消灭以后，就成为劳动人民的内部矛盾）、全面适用的（不是局部的）根本方针。有人认为既然肯定为人民内部矛盾，就可以撇开阶级矛盾；或者，既然肯定阶级矛盾还存在，那就无法当作人民内部矛盾来处理。对此，我感到有两点需要说一说。第一点，我以为怀疑工人阶级同资产阶级的矛盾是否或者能否当作人民内部矛盾来处理，是没有根据的。党对于同民族资产阶级的矛盾，在整个社会主义革命时期，都是按照放在人民内部矛盾之内的方针来处理的。我们只要把对待民族资产阶级同对待官僚资产阶级的方针一比较，就可以看出明显的原则区别。过去几年中阶级矛盾的处理（包括“五反”在内），在党的正确领导下，总的说来不都是按照团结、批评、团结的公式进行，并且解决了问题的吗？正因为领导全国人民的党坚持了这一方针，这就使得本来是对抗性的矛盾逐步转化为非对抗性的矛盾。高潮以后，在清产核资、人事安排、定息等等问题上是存在着阶级矛盾的，可是都按照处理人民内部矛盾的原则，按照团结、批评、团结的公式作出适当的处理。
    工人阶级同资产阶级之间，不仅有思想的矛盾，还有阶级利益的矛盾。这种矛盾是人民内部的矛盾，但又不同于一般的是非矛盾。
    第二点，把阶级矛盾放在人民内部矛盾里面了，对于阶级矛盾，又应当怎样来正确对待呢？当然，突出阶级矛盾是不对的，因为在社会主义革命基本结束以后，阶级矛盾已经退居次要地位，突出的是人民内部矛盾。但是，如果对阶级矛盾避而不谈，甚至抹煞阶级矛盾，这也是不符合事实的。今天，工人阶级同民族资产阶级政治上的一致性大大增加了，然而，他们之间，还存在着差异和矛盾。这些差异和矛盾就是人民内部矛盾中民族资产阶级作为矛盾一方的特殊性，这个特殊性是客观的存在，抛开它就不能正确地、适当地处理这一部分的人民内部矛盾。例如对民族资产阶级分子的安排政策，叫做量才录用，适当照顾。为什么在量才录用之外还要加个适当照顾呢？这就是因为还有阶级差异；这就表明在一视同仁之外还需要有所区别。工人阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾，尽管大大缓和了，而且终究要完全消灭，在我们一定时期的政治、社会生活中间还是很明显的。他们之间不仅有着思想矛盾，而且还有着阶级利益的矛盾。例如定息问题，职工中间对于定息五厘都是有意见的，七年不变，意见也不少，但在资产阶级这一方面却有人认为七年五厘还是吃了亏，主张定息还要延长多少年。这首先应当肯定是是非矛盾，是人民内部的矛盾，但是这同一般的是非矛盾有没有不同？显然是不同的，不同之点在于这个是非矛盾反映出阶级矛盾。处理起来，还是正视阶级矛盾好，还是抹煞阶级矛盾好？很明显，抹煞的办法是不好的。当然，在处理人民内部矛盾的方针下，提出阶级矛盾，决不是为了扩大和巩固它，而是为了进一步解决这个矛盾，以致最后地消灭这个矛盾。在教育改造的工作中，在处理阶级关系中，正视阶级矛盾，按照具体情况对它进行具体的分析，而不是笼统对待，这只会使得我们的工作做得更能符合具体情况，更有利于解决问题，增进团结。
    把工人阶级同资产阶级的矛盾当作人民内部矛盾来处理，有一个重要的前提，就是要资产阶级接受社会主义改造。
    总起来说：把工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾放在人民内部矛盾中处理，这是党已经肯定了的根本方针。实现这个方针，有一个重要前提，就是要民族资产阶级接受社会主义改造。这个前提实现了，那么，尽管阶级矛盾存在，有的时候还相当尖锐，这个方针还是能够实现的，高潮以前的事实证明了这一点。高潮以后，阶级矛盾虽然存在，但是已经转为非对抗性了，这就更有利于贯彻这个方针。前提是什么？前提是民族资产阶级要坚持社会主义的道路和社会主义的准则。问题不在于是否阶级矛盾，更不在于是否承认有阶级矛盾，问题在于是否坚持社会主义的准则。一离开这个准则，团结的主观愿望就没有必要的内容，批评和自我批评也没有划明是非的标准，这样，就不可能达到新的团结基础。因此，必须在肯定用团结、批评、团结的公式来处理阶级矛盾的同时，肯定社会主义的准则。毕鸣岐认为：私方人员的自卑感主要是从阶级关系来的
    毕鸣岐在他的书面发言中，谈了“谁是教条主义者”和“从阶级看自卑感”两个问题。
    他认为：各地私方人员存在着自卑感，最主要的是从阶级关系来的。他说：“我们社会主义的一切发展是一日千里，在时刻变化着，人的思想变化也是日新月异。在这种伟大变革中，民族资产阶级仍然戴着资产阶级的帽子，那就不可能相安无事、心安理得的戴下去。思想觉悟越高，不安情绪越大，这是客观事实，也是目前思想上最大的矛盾，所谓在工作中的自卑感就由此而生。”
    毕鸣岐认为：李康年说定息照5％计算，以二十年可以得到全部代价，为了减去矛盾从58年起发行无记名式的定期存单，这种看法脱离了民族资产阶级现时的实际思想变化，与这次座谈会所反映的多数工商业者要消灭阶级、消灭阶级关系、消灭剥削和消灭自卑感背道而驰（当然也会有少数人希望以二十年赎买完毕）。他说：提出定息延长二十年，工人阶级反对是理所当然；民族资产阶级中多数的人也不会接受，而我们民族资产阶级的子女也不会答应。
    毕鸣岐说：章乃器同志说“不应该把定息说成剥削，而应说成是不劳而获的收入，这样，工商业者才能心平气和”。的确，这个说法，我个人就感到舒服，我相信其他工商业者也同样感到舒服。毕鸣岐又说：“定息额是根据‘定产估值’，它是不劳而获的收入。的确，它也与资本主义经营时期任所欲为的剥削不一样。它终究是属于剥削性质的。在走入社会主义社会后，也是不应当存在的。因此，我的结论是：它是属于剥削性质的。”
    毕鸣岐说：“有许多工商业者已不存在剥削，只有工资收入，即其中有相当多的人有一点定息，但是占工资收入的比重很小。”他认为，“对于以上在工商界占有相当多数的人，应当给他们摘掉资产阶级的帽子，使他们从资产阶级中分化出去。”
