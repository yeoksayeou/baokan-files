Resolutely Counterattack the Rightists and Fight to Defend the Socialist Cause
Guo Qiaoran, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League

　　Today, we are facing an acute and complex class struggle and political struggle in the ideological realm. This is a serious struggle between defending the leadership of the Party and adhering to the socialist line, and negating the leadership of the Party and betraying the socialist cause. Every true socialist revolutionary, every patriotic intellectual, will be tested in this struggle and must resolutely stand firm on the socialist position.

　　This struggle was triggered by right-wing political careerists using the opportunity of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign to challenge the Party.

　　The sole purpose of the rectification movement is to overcome the "three evils," correctly resolve contradictions among the people, thereby consolidating the Party's leadership, strengthening unity among the people, and more smoothly advancing the socialist cause. However, right-wing ambitious elements have used this opportunity to stir up a gust of ill wind, publishing various anti-socialist fallacies, spreading dissatisfaction with the Party and pessimistic and disappointed sentiments about the socialist cause, attempting to win people's hearts, blur the masses' understanding, and shake the Party's leadership, in order to achieve their ulterior and shameful goals.

　　Among the statements of these rightists, particularly infuriating and worthy of vigilance are the fallacies of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, Chen Xingui, and others, who are leading members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. Zhang Bojun proposed the "Political Design Institute" and the conspiracy to transform the CPPCC into an "Upper House," and openly expressed dissatisfaction with the "profit sharing" by the CCP at the State Council meetings. This is an attempt to shake the Party's leadership from the aspect of state power, paving the way for right-wing ambitious elements to compete with the Communist Party for the leadership of the country. Luo Longji proposed the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee," and insisted that people who had directly handled the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the purge of reactionaries in the past (meaning the Chinese Communist Party) should not participate. This is not only objectively advocating for the grievances of counter-revolutionaries but also seeking to compete with the Party for the leadership of the state's judicial work, echoing Zhang Bojun's attempt to seize administrative leadership from a different angle. Chu Anping, the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, whose president is Zhang Bojun, put forward the fallacy of "the Party's world," and insulted our beloved leaders Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, attempting to negate the Party's leadership from the aspect of personnel arrangements, and preparing for right-wing political careerists to share the spoils of power. Even more arrogant is Chen Xingui, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, who even resorted to sophistry and malicious distortion, insisting that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the root of the "three evils," exaggerating the dark side of socialism, and thus drawing the absurd conclusion of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, providing a "theoretical basis" for the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Chu Anping. If we were to transform the Party and the state power according to the fallacies of these rightists, it would mean abolishing the Party's leadership and abolishing the people's democratic dictatorship, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat. Coupled with the suggestion by Zhang Naiqi, Li Kangnian, and others, spokespersons for the bourgeois rightists who are unwilling to see their class die out, to "extend the fixed interest rate for twenty years," then our country would only deviate from the socialist path, allowing capitalism to be restored, and would actually return to the old China under the rule of semi-feudal and semi-colonial bureaucratic capitalism. In this way, the great victory of the Chinese socialist revolution would become a bubble, and the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution would also be completely abandoned. Can the Chinese people tolerate this? Can all patriotic democrats agree to this?

　　In addition to severely refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and actions of these rightists in theory and drawing a clear line in politics, ideology, and standpoint, we must also thoroughly expose their conspiracies and their consistent anti-socialist historical facts.

　　I have known Zhang Bojun for over twenty years. His fallacies this time have made me realize that his consistent words and actions in the past were entirely those of an ambitious person engaging in political marketing and political blackmail. He has always vainly attempted to realize his "middle-of-the-road line" proposition, and he has always stubbornly opposed the Party.

　　When the Democratic League was illegally declared an "illegal" organization by the Nanjing Chiang clique in 1947, Zhang Bojun came to Hong Kong. At that time, he still believed that the Kuomintang could not eliminate the Communist Party, and the Communist Party could not overthrow the Kuomintang. Therefore, he sang the praises of the "federal system," advocating that China should be "governed by division." He fantasized about putting the Yellow River basin under the jurisdiction of the CCP; the Yangtze River basin would still be ruled by the Kuomintang; Guangdong, Guangxi... would be led by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; and Jiangxi and Fujian would be the responsibility of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Thus, he organized the so-called China Democratic Action Committee as a military speculative activity, intending to implement his so-called "federal system" of feudal separatism. Although his absurd fantasy was not realized, it was deeply rooted in his mind. In the spring and summer of 1948, many underground organizations of the Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in various provinces and cities were successively destroyed by the reactionaries. Many comrades who had worked in the Chiang-controlled areas came to Hong Kong. Seeing that the leadership work of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was very poor, they jointly submitted a letter requesting opinions on improving work, asking the Central Committee to improve its work. A five-person team was then established to examine the work line and political line of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and give a reply. In the examination work, it was emphasized that the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was taking an opportunist line politically and requested immediate correction. It also criticized Zhang Bojun for having a serious patriarchal style in leadership and pointed out the argument that the Chinese revolution must be led by the proletariat to achieve victory. However, Zhang Bojun not only strongly disagreed but also angrily scolded. This fact specifically illustrates that Zhang Bojun's political speculation, blackmail, and opposition to the Party's leadership did not start today. Not only that, but after Zhang Bojun arrived in the liberated areas in 1949, he was still dissatisfied with the Party. He once wrote a letter in Harbin to a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party who remained in Hong Kong, saying that he was doing nothing, and he had gained nothing from asking others (referring to the CCP). He said that our underestimation of ourselves over the years was a great loss... meaning he was complaining that the comrades of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party could not build their own world well, and now they had to "ask others" for help. He also said: The struggle is quite long-term, and it is still not too late to catch up now... My (Zhang's own claim) usual views are still correct... meaning that the "federal system" is still correct, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should still engage in military speculative activities with a certain party. At that time, Zhang Bojun also said in his letter that he would try to return to Hong Kong. This shows his dissatisfaction with the Party, his disbelief that the Communist Party could be relied upon, and his stubborn desire to start his own thing.

　　After liberation, Zhang Bojun expressed dissatisfaction because the democratic parties had suspended the development of organizations, and his mood was also depressed. It was not until the democratic parties redeveloped their organizations that he became active again. After the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties," Zhang Bojun became arrogant and thought that he could "do great things." He advocated that the democratic parties should develop hundreds of thousands or even one or two million members and that there should be a "bicameral system." Then, in the Party's rectification movement, he echoed Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and others in publishing fallacies against the Party's leadership and against socialism, frantically attacking socialism. Zhang Bojun usually seemed to be talking about Marxism-Leninism all the time, but in fact, he was using the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to deceive people. He once said: "We must have the mind of Marxism-Leninism, but we must also have Zeng Guofan's methods of dealing with people and handling affairs." This sentence seems particularly relevant today. It turns out that he is using Marxism-Leninism as a guise on the surface, but in essence, he is following the set of methods used by the feudal ruler Zeng Guofan to play power tricks to deal with the Communist Party.

　　These facts show that Zhang Bojun is a political careerist who has consistently opposed the Party's leadership and opposed socialism. Since liberation, he has been playing a double-dealing trick. In the work of the Party, he supports and echoes the backward attacking progress internally, and he appears in a "leftist" posture externally, especially towards the Communist Party, to deceive the Party and the people. For example, in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, he suppressed comrades such as Ji Fang and Li Boqiu, and in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, he attacked and squeezed out comrades such as Deng Chumin and Hu Yuzhi, and even openly scolded Comrade Hu Yuzhi at the meeting, saying: "Don't think you are clever, but I don't trust you!" Zhang Bojun has always been accustomed to the political style of juggling and playing double-dealing tricks. Everyone who has been with him has felt this.

　　In Guangdong, there has also appeared a rightist element, Yun Yinglin (he is a Standing Committee Member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), who is politically and ideologically in the same vein as Zhang Bojun. Like Zhang Bojun, he also emphasizes the need to take the "middle-of-the-road line" and has consistently adopted a stubborn attitude of resisting the acceptance of the Party's leadership. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and even on the eve of liberation, he had been engaged in armed military speculative activities, and he stubbornly refused to accept the leadership of the Communist Party. It is said that when Comrade Zhang Yan, an anti-Japanese general, announced an uprising in Nanlu in 1945, he even went to Wuchuan to persuade Zhang Yan: "Don't accept the leadership of the Communist Party, if you want to do it, do it yourself!" As a result, Zhang Yan's uprising failed, and he was unwilling to stay in the liberated area and ran to Guangxi, where he was killed by the reactionaries. This was not without being influenced by his thinking. In 1949, when Comrade Mei Rixin of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party went to work in the Yu Bei guerrilla area, Yun Yinglin firmly opposed it, still insisting on the military speculative line of the "middle-of-the-road line" of "if you want to do it, do it yourself." At the same time, he also doubted whether Mei Rixin could be trusted (saying whether Mei Rixin would run to the Communist Party). After liberation, his attitude of resisting the Party remained unchanged. When he served as the Chairman of the Hainan Branch of the China Democratic League, he confronted the Party. Last year, some members of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party had some problems in their ideological style. The comrades of the Party Affairs Office of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Provincial Committee discussed methods with the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in order to better solve the problem, but he considered it as "interfering in internal affairs." This is the same as Zhang Bojun's thoughts and actions. Therefore, in the Party's rectification movement, he and Luo Yiqun clamored for the landlord class, attempting to weaken or abolish the Party's leadership role, and attempting to push the socialist cause back to the road of feudal landlord and bureaucratic bourgeois rule that was abandoned by the people.

　　At the same time, some people have also appeared, such as Dong Meikan, Lin Kongxiang, Lin Chujun, Lin Lunyan, etc. Although the anti-socialist fallacies they have made may be different in degree and origin from those of Zhang Bojun and Yun Yinglin, they intentionally or unintentionally peddle revisionism and the absurd remarks of old democracy, or they doubt and negate the Party's leadership, or they hate the Communist Party members who serve the people wholeheartedly, or they miss the old society and have a dislike for the new society. These people's right-wing remarks have directly played a destructive role and spread extremely harmful influences among the masses. We must, without exception, draw a clear line in ideology from such right-wing remarks and resolutely launch an irreconcilable struggle against these remarks, so that they can quickly correct their position and correct their mistakes as soon as possible.

　　We deeply realize that the current struggle against the rightists has entered an increasingly acute and in-depth stage. We must more resolutely draw a clear line with them ideologically and politically. In particular, for rightists such as Zhang Bojun and Yun Yinglin, who have ulterior motives, we must further expose their long-term anti-socialist conspiracies, so that they can be exposed and completely isolated among the masses. Since Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others are in leading positions in the China Democratic League, their ideological poisons affect all aspects of the League's work and must be thoroughly eliminated. We resolutely support the League Central Committee's call to carry out rectification, smash the rightists' conspiracies, and adhere to the socialist direction. Socialism has not only become an irresistible belief of the people of the whole country but has also become an unshakable track in our actual life. Without socialism, our motherland cannot embark on the road of independence, prosperity, freedom, and happiness. We must consolidate the Communist Party's leadership, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and realize socialism. Therefore, we must resolutely counterattack the rightists and fight to defend the socialist cause!

　　坚决回击右派分子，为保卫社会主义事业而斗争
    民盟中央常委、民盟广东省委副主任委员　郭翘然
    今天我们正面临着一场尖锐复杂的思想范畴内的阶级斗争和政治斗争。这是一场保卫党的领导、坚持社会主义路线和否定党的领导、出卖社会主义事业之间的严肃斗争。每一个真正的社会主义的革命者，每一个爱国的知识分子，都要在这场斗争中受到考验，坚决站稳社会主义的立场。
    这一场斗争是由右派的政治野心家利用中国共产党开展整风的机会向党挑战而引出来的。
    整风运动的唯一目的，是为了克服“三害”，正确解决人民内部矛盾，从而巩固党的领导，加强人民内部的团结，更顺利地推进社会主义事业。但是，右派野心分子却利用这个机会，刮起一阵歪风，发表各种反社会主义的谬论，散布对党不满和对社会主义事业的悲观失望情绪，妄图笼络人心，模糊群众认识，动摇党的领导，以达到他们不可告人的可耻目的。
    在这些右派分子的言论中，特别令人愤慨和值得警惕的是民盟中央领导人之一的章伯钧、罗隆基和储安平、陈新桂等的谬论。章伯钧提出“政治设计院”和将政协变为
  “上议院”的诡谋，并公开表示不满国务院会议上由中共“提成品”，这是企图从国家政权方面动摇党的领导，为右派野心家和共产党争夺国家的领导权铺好道路；罗隆基提出要建立“平反委员会”，而且不要过去直接掌握镇反、肃反的人（这就是指中国共产党）参加，这不但是客观上为反革命分子叫屈伸冤，而且要和党争夺国家司法工作的领导权，同章伯钧的争夺行政领导权角度不同而遥相呼应；由章伯钧任社长的光明日报的总编辑储安平则提“党天下”的谬论，并侮辱我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和周总理，企图从人事安排上否定党的领导，为右派政治野心家掌权分羹作准备，而更其狂妄的，是民盟候补中央委员陈新桂，居然强词夺理，恶意歪曲，硬说无产阶级专政是“三害”的根源，夸大社会主义的阴暗面，从而得出取消无产阶级专政的荒谬结论，为章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平的反动言论提供“理论基础”。如果按照这些右派分子的谬论去改造党、改造国家政权，那就是取消党的领导，取消人民民主专政即无产阶级专政，加上不愿意本阶级死亡的资产阶级右派分子代言人章乃器、李康年之流建议的“延长定息二十年”，那么，我们的国家就只有脱离社会主义的轨道，让资本主义复辟，而实际上是回到半封建半殖民地的官僚资本主义统治下的旧中国去。这样，中国社会主义革命的伟大胜利将成泡影，中国民主革命的胜利也要全功尽弃，中国人民能够容忍吗？一切爱国的民主人士能够同意吗？
    我们对这些右派分子的反党反社会主义的言行，除了在理论上严加驳斥，在政治、思想、立场上划清界限以外，还要彻底揭露他们的阴谋和他们一贯的反社会主义的史实。
    我和章伯钧认识了二十多年，从这次他的谬论中，使我认识他在过去的一贯的言论行动完全是一个赶政治市场、搞政治讹诈的野心家，他一直都妄图实现他的“中间路线”的主张，他一直都在顽强的同党对立。
    当1947年，民主同盟被南京蒋帮非法宣布为“非法”团体以后，章伯钧来了香港，他那时仍认为：国民党固然不能消灭共产党，共产党也不能推翻国民党，因而高唱“联邦制”的主张，主张将中国“划区而治”。他幻想把黄河流域归中共管辖；长江流域仍归国民党统治；广东、广西……由民革管领；江西、福建则归农工党负责。于是他组织了所谓中国民主行动委员会，作为军事投机的活动，意图实行他的所谓“联邦制”的封建割据局面。虽然他这样荒唐的幻想，并没有得到实现，但在他的思想深处却是根深蒂固的。1948年春夏间，民盟和农工党在各省、市的许多地下组织，先后遭受反动派的破坏。许多工作同志由蒋管区到香港来，看到农工党中央的领导工作做得很坏，便联名提出要求改进工作意见书，要求中央改进工作。于是成立五人小组，检查农工党的工作路线和政治路线，并作出答复意见，在检查工作中曾强调指出农工党中央在政治上走的是机会主义的路线，要求立即纠正，还批评了章伯钧在领导上存在着严重的家长作风，并指出中国革命必须由无产阶级领导才能获得胜利的论据。但章伯钧不但大不为然，而且厉颜大骂，这一事实，具体地说明了章伯钧在政治上的投机、讹诈和对抗党的领导，并不是从今天开始的。不特如此，当章伯钧于1949年到达解放区后，仍然对党不满。他曾在哈尔滨写了一封信给留香港的农工党中央委员说：自己无作为，求人（指中共）无所得，我们多年来轻视自己就是很大的损失……意思是埋怨农工党的同志不能很好的自己打天下，今天要“求人”了。又说：斗争是相当长期的，现在急起直追还来得及的……我（章自称）平时的看法说法仍然正确……意思是“联邦制”还是对的，要农工党同某方仍搞军事投机活动。那时章伯钧在他信中也说到他要设法回到香港来。这是他对党不满，不相信共产党是可以依靠的，而且顽固地想自己另搞一套。
    解放后章伯钧因民主党派暂停发展组织，他表示不满，情绪也很消沉；直至民主党派重新发展组织后，他才又积极起来；到了党中央提出了“共产党同民主党派长期共存，互相监督”的方针后，章伯钧便趾高气扬地以为可以“大搞”了，便主张民主党派要发展几十万而至一、二百万成员，要搞“两院制”。跟着便在党整风运动中，同罗隆基、储安平等一唱一和地发表反对党的领导、反对社会主义的谬论，猖狂的向社会主义进攻。章伯钧平时在口头上好像口口声声都是马列主义，但事实上却是披着马列主义的外衣来骗人。他曾这样说：“我们要有马列主义的头脑，但也要有曾国藩待人接物的处世方法。”这句话在今天看起来特别具有现实意义，原来他表面上是用马列主义做幌子，实质上他是师承封建统治者曾国藩那一套玩弄权术的方法来对付共产党的。
    从这些事实说明了章伯钧是一贯反对党的领导、反对社会主义的政治野心家；解放以来，还一直是玩弄着两面派的手法。在党派工作中，对内则支持和附和落后向进步进攻，对外特别是对共产党，则以“左”的姿态出现来蒙蔽党和欺骗人民。如在农工党中央则压抑季方、李伯球诸同志等，在民盟中央则打击排挤邓初民、胡愈之诸同志，甚至在会场上公开谩骂胡愈之同志说：“不要以为你有小聪明，但我不信任你！”章伯钧的一贯惯于纵横捭阖一拉一打耍两面派手法的政客作风。凡是和他相处过的人都是共同感受到的。
    在广东方面也出现了右派分子云应霖（他是民盟广东省委员会常委、农工民主党广东省委员会副主任），他是与章伯钧在政治上、思想上一脉相承的。他也像章伯钧一样，强调要走“中间路线”的，对于接受党的领导，也一贯采取顽固的抗拒态度。他在抗战期间以至解放前夕，一直都在搞军事投机的武装活动，他顽强地拒绝接受共产党的领导。据说在1945年抗日将领张炎同志在南路宣布起义时，他竟亲到吴川劝张炎：“不要接受共产党的领导，要搞就自己搞！”而致后来张炎起义失败，卒不愿留在解放区而跑去广西被反动派扑杀了。这是不无受到他的思想影响的。1949年农工党派梅日新同志到禺北游击区工作时，云应霖却坚决反对，仍坚持“要搞就自己搞”的中间路线的军事投机路线。同时他还认为梅日新是否靠得住（说梅日新是否会跑到共产党那边去）。到了解放以后，他对党的抗拒情绪仍然没有改变，当他充任民盟海南分部主任委员时，则同党分庭抗礼，去年农工党广东省委员会的个别委员在思想作风上有一些问题，中共省委统战部党派处同志为着使问题更好解决，曾和农工党商量办法，他竟认为是“干涉内政”。这是和章伯钧的思想行动同出一辙的。因此，他在党整风运动中和罗翼群一道为地主阶级叫嚣，企图削弱或取消党的领导作用，企图把社会主义事业推回到为人民抛弃了的封建地主官僚资产阶级统治的道路上去。
    与此同时，也出现了一些人，如董每戡、林孔湘、林楚君、林伦彦等，虽然他们所发出的反社会主义的谬论，在程度上和在根源上也许与章伯钧、云应霖有所不同；然而他们有意无意地贩卖修正主义和旧民主主义的荒谬言论，或者是怀疑和否定党的领导，或者是仇视全心全意为人民服务的共产党员、或者是对旧社会不胜怀恋，对新社会产生恶感，这些人的右派言论直接起了破坏作用，在群众中散播了极为有害的影响，我们对这样的右派言论，必须毫无例外地在思想上划清界限，坚决地对这些言论展开不调和的斗争，使他们迅速端正立场，及早纠正错误。
    我们深刻认识当前对右派分子的斗争，已经进入愈益尖锐而深入的阶段，我们必须更坚决地在思想上政治上同他们划清界限，特别是对章伯钧、云应霖这样别具用心的右派分子，更要进一步揭发他们长期以来的反社会主义的阴谋，使他们在群众中原形毕露而彻底被孤立起来。由于章伯钧、罗隆基等在民盟居于领导工作地位，他们的思想毒素影响到盟的各方面工作，必须彻底加以清除，我们坚决拥护盟中央关于开展整风的号召，粉碎右派分子的阴谋，坚持社会主义方向。社会主义不但已经成为全国人民不可抗拒的信念，而且已经成为我们实际生活不可动摇的轨道，没有社会主义，我们祖国就不可能走上独立、富强、自由、幸福的道路。我们要巩固共产党的领导，要巩固人民民主专政，要实现社会主义。因此，我们必须坚决地回击右派分子，为保卫社会主义事业而斗争！
