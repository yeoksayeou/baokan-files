Chairman Mao's Report Reaches Baotou
By our correspondent Liu Heng

　　On the 19th, Baotou's newspapers published Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Early in the morning, the entrance of the Baotou Post and Telecommunications Bureau was crowded with people. They were waiting for the day's newspaper, hoping to read Chairman Mao's long-awaited report as soon as possible. As the time for the post office to distribute the newspapers drew closer, people felt that time was passing more slowly. Many people repeatedly urged the post office to open its doors quickly.

　　Before office hours, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau opened its doors ten minutes early. People rushed in. Old Wu, who was selling the newspapers, said while busy with his hands and feet: "Don't grab, don't grab, there are plenty of newspapers." In the past, the retail sales of Inner Mongolia Daily and Baotou Daily were only ninety copies per day, but today it suddenly increased to five thousand copies. Those who bought the newspaper, just squeezed out of the post office door, excitedly read Chairman Mao's report. June 19th, what a meaningful day! The people of Baotou, who are advancing on the socialist road, are filled with wisdom and confidence.

　　Many people in Baotou told reporters their innermost thoughts after reading Chairman Mao's report. Fan Yi, Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: "Chairman Mao put forward six criteria, giving us a nose to smell out fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. Chairman Mao's explanation of the boundary between the enemy and ourselves, struggle, unity, and other issues is very thorough and clear, giving us eyes, and we will see problems more clearly and accurately in the future." Bai Yusheng, a worker at the Baotou Metallurgical Construction General Company, said: "We rely on the sunshine to generate heat and on the Communist Party to keep warm. Chairman Mao's speech gave us confidence and strength. Whoever opposes the Communist Party and opposes socialism, we will resolutely fight him." Yang Sanhui, a member of the Jiefang Vegetable Garden Cooperative, said: "Chairman Mao said that agricultural cooperatives need to be consolidated, which is completely right. The living standards of everyone in our cooperative have improved at least twice compared to before liberation. If we have more time and more experience, our lives will be even better." Qin Xishu, Chairman of the Baotou Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "In the past, I often worried about this capitalist label on my head. Now I know that as long as I support the Constitution, accept socialist transformation, the contradiction with the working class is non-antagonistic. Chairman Mao's report strengthened my confidence in taking the socialist road."

　　毛主席报告传到包头
　　本报记者　刘衡
    19日，包头的报纸登载了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告。一清早，包头邮电局门口站满了人。他们等候着当天的报纸，希望尽早读到渴望已久的毛主席的报告。邮局发报的时间愈迫近，人们愈觉得时间过得慢。许多人一再催促邮局快开门。
    办公时间还没有到，邮电局提前十分钟开了门。人们一拥而进，卖报的老吴一边手忙脚乱，一边不住嘴地说：“别抢啦，别抢啦，报纸有的是。”往日内蒙古日报和包头日报每天只有九十份零售，今天一下增加到五千份。买到报纸的人，刚挤出邮局的大门，就兴奋地读着毛主席的报告。6月19日，这是多么有意义的一天啊！正在社会主义道路上迈进的包头市人民，心里充满了智慧和信心。
    包头市许多人读了毛主席报告后，纷纷把心里话告诉记者。中共包头市委书记范易说：“毛主席提出六条标准，给了我们鼻子，让我们闻得出香花、毒草。毛主席对敌我界限、斗争、团结等等问题讲得十分透彻、明确，给了我们眼睛，今后看问题会更明亮、准确了。”包头冶金建筑总公司工人白雨生说：“咱们靠阳光发热，靠共产党取暖，毛主席讲演给了我们信心和力量。谁反对共产党，反对社会主义，咱们就跟他坚决斗争。”解放菜园社员杨三惠说：“毛主席说农业合作社需要巩固，这完全对。咱们社每个人的生活水平比解放前至少提高两倍。要是时间长一些，经验多一些，我们生活还会更好。”包头市工商联主任委员覃锡树说：“以前我老嘀咕我头上这顶资本家帽子。现在知道，只要我拥护宪法，接受社会主义改造，和工人阶级的矛盾就是非对抗性的。毛主席的报告加强了我走社会主义道路的信心。”
