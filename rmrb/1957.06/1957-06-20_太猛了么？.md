　　Too Harsh?
　　Wei Qun

　　Being both serious and earnest, yet gentle as a breeze and soft as a rain, is the established policy of this rectification movement. From the very beginning, some people were dissatisfied with this approach, saying things like "rectifying others with fierce storms, rectifying oneself with gentle breezes and soft rains." It seems these people advocate using a storm-like approach for both enemy-friend issues and right-wrong issues. While the Communist Party insisted on this policy, it not only did not object to sharp, even extreme, criticisms from non-Party members, but also believed that this social pressure was beneficial to the rectification. It should be noted that from the start, the meetings held in government offices and schools were filled with a sense of impending crisis. Communist Party members listened to the opinions of all parties with a serious attitude. The responsible comrades of some units declared in advance that they would "only bring their ears to listen to dissenting opinions" and would not even explain opinions that were clearly wrong. This was the situation in early May. I believe this stage of the movement was normal and healthy.

　　Soon, scenes of fierce storms appeared. At meetings in government offices and schools, there were those who broke into curses, those who demanded the dismissal and punishment of people by name, those who demanded that Communist Party members "get out," and those who wanted to "overthrow you and kill Communists." This should be considered a fierce storm, right? What's strange is that at this time, the rightists were only secretly rejoicing; not one of them said the movement was going too far. This is a fact, with newspapers as proof.

　　Then, the Party newspapers spoke, the workers spoke, the peasants spoke, and the democratic parties also began to criticize the rightists internally. We read the newspapers every day, and many people also attend meetings every day. May I ask, in the criticisms of the rightists, were there any words like "overthrow" or "kill"? Were there any words like "demanding immediate punishment"? No, there is also newspaper proof.

　　However, at this time, some seemingly very "fair" people came out and spoke, saying things like: "It's probably going to be收了 (brought to a close)," "Another encirclement is coming," "Too harsh," "Is this also considered gentle as a breeze and soft as a rain?" Isn't this very strange? When the rightists were shouting about killing, why didn't they say "Too harsh"? Why didn't they advise them to be a little more gentle as a breeze and soft as a rain? Only the rightists are allowed to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism, and the people are not allowed to counter-criticize the rightists. They secretly feel happy when the rightists shout about killing, but they feel sorry when the people reason with the rightists. What kind of logic is this? And what kind of emotion is this?

　　I don't want to make accusations about motives; I only advise these "kind-hearted" gentlemen to read the People's Daily editorial of the 14th of this month, "Is it a matter of Standpoint?" again.

　　太猛了么？
　　韦群
    既严肃认真又和风细雨，是这次整风运动的既定方针，运动一开始，就有少数人不满意这种作法，说了什么“整人狂风暴雨，整己和风细雨”之类，看来，这些人是主张不论对敌我问题或者是非问题，都要用狂风暴雨式的做法的。共产党一方面坚持这个方针，另一方面不仅不反对党外人士对党的尖锐的、乃至偏激的批评，而且认为这种社会压力对整风有好处。应该看到，在机关、学校召开的座谈会上，一开始就出现了风雨满楼的景况，共产党员们以严肃的心情，倾听了各方人士的意见，有的单位的党员负责人预先声明，“只带耳朵来听逆耳之言”，对分明是错误的意见也不加解释，这是5月上旬的情况，我认为这一阶段的运动是正常而健康的。
    不久，狂风暴雨的场面出现了，在机关、学校的会议上，破口谩骂者有之，指名叫姓要求撤职法办者有之，要共产党员“滚出去”者有之，要“打倒你们，杀共产党人”者有之，这应该说是狂风暴雨了吧，奇怪的是在这个时候右派分子只是暗暗称庆，没有一个人说运动搞得太猛。这是事实；有报刊为证。
    接着，党报讲话了，工人讲话了，农民讲话了，民主党派内部也展开对右派分子的批评。我们天天看报，有不少人也天天参加会议，请问，对右派分子的批评中有过“打倒”“杀”这一类话么？有过“要求立即法办”这一类话么？没有，也有报刊为证。
    可是，就在这个时候，有一些似乎很“公正”的人们出来讲话了：什么“大概要收了”、“又要围剿了”、“太猛了”、“这样也算是和风细雨么”之类。这不是很奇怪么？右派喊杀喊打的时候，为什么不说“太猛了”呢？为什么不劝他们和风细雨一点呢？只准右派反对共产党、反对社会主义，不许人民对右派进行反批评，右派喊杀喊打暗暗觉得痛快，人民对右派说理就觉得心疼，这是什么逻辑？这又是什么感情？
    我不想作诛心之论，我只劝这些“好心肠”的先生们再看一遍本月14日人民日报“是不是立场问题？”这一篇社论。
