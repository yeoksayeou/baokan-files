The Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill Successfully Convenes Employee Representative Assembly; Harmonious Relations Between Leaders and the Masses; Workers' Production Enthusiasm Soars

    (Our Dispatch) In the Wuhan Public-Private Joint Yuhua Cotton Mill, workers frequently visit the offices of leading cadres to discuss issues. In the past, workers mostly came to request the factory to resolve their personal life and work-related problems. Sometimes, because the workers' demands exceeded practical possibilities, and sometimes because the leading cadres did not seriously consider the workers' opinions, the two sides often failed to reach an agreement, and sometimes even quarreled. Recently, however, the situation has undergone a significant change. Many workers still come to the offices, but the vast majority come to report on work progress and discuss how to improve work in various areas with the leading cadres. The reason for this change is that the factory convened an employee representative assembly in March.
    This employee representative assembly was convened as an institution for employees to participate in enterprise management and to supervise the administrative leadership of the enterprise. Before the meeting, the representatives formed five inspection teams, which went deep into all departments of the factory to inspect and study problems in production, finance, labor discipline, and welfare. During the assembly, the representatives, focusing on the central theme of increasing production and practicing economy, fully promoted democracy and realistically criticized some bureaucratic styles of work of the factory leaders. At the same time, they also opposed some undesirable phenomena among a few employees, such as not observing labor discipline and making excessive demands on welfare. After the meeting, both the leading cadres and the worker masses felt that their thinking had been greatly improved, and the relationship between them was further strengthened.

　　Leaders' Thinking Suddenly Cleared
    In the past, especially last year, the Yuhua Cotton Mill had performed relatively well in completing its plans, and the leading cadres had paid more attention to using the mass line method of work. Therefore, although the factory's leading cadres believed that there might be some bureaucracy in their work, they generally felt that the problem was not significant. At this employee representative assembly, the representatives, on the one hand, affirmed the achievements of the factory in various aspects, and on the other hand, sincerely put forward more than one hundred opinions concerning production, life, and other aspects. Many of these opinions were problems that the leading cadres had not been aware of or had not considered in the past. For example, they had always believed that the factory's raw cotton management work was very meticulous and was the "trump card" in various technical management tasks. However, after the employee representatives' inspection, it was found that the raw cotton management system formulated by the factory had not been strictly implemented among the workers. Regarding the welfare issues of the employees, in the past they always thought that they knew the difficulties of the masses, and that most of the things that could be done had already been done. However, at this assembly, the representatives raised many things that could be done but had not been done, and also criticized the unreasonable phenomenon of some cadres not paying for electricity and water in their residences. These opinions greatly cleared the minds of the leading cadres. The manager of the factory said: In the past, even if I was criticized for one hundred acts of bureaucracy, I would not know where the bureaucracy was. Although I was criticized this time, I felt that the criticism was very accurate. Recently, the factory has formulated various systems and methods for improving work based on the opinions put forward by the representative assembly.

　　Unreasonable Demands Among Workers Eliminated
    Some workers in this factory had previously raised some excessive or unreasonable demands regarding welfare. For example, some workers, not understanding the situation of tight building materials, requested the factory to build dormitories originally planned for the third quarter of this year earlier in the second quarter. Coal carriers in the Power Department, for the sake of convenience, once requested that the system of three shifts sharing a set of raincoats and rubber shoes be changed to one set per shift. After the leading cadres explained the current difficulties of the country and the factory at the representative assembly, most of these opinions were eliminated. Previously, there were a small number of workers in the factory who were not at ease in their work, made trouble over wage treatment issues, and had poor labor discipline. Although they had been criticized and educated by the leading cadres, there was not much change. During the representative assembly, the vast majority of employees and representatives actively exposed and criticized these incorrect thoughts and behaviors, and now many people have changed.

    After the representative assembly, the workers' enthusiasm for production soared to an unprecedented level. In the past, the quality of machine maintenance by the maintenance workers in the carding process had never been 100% up to standard; after the representative assembly, they repaired machines that were completely up to standard for the first time. The yellow can reversal operation method in the drawing process had been promoted for more than a year without success. After the representative assembly, because the workers actively requested to learn, it has now been fully promoted. The first-class product rate of cotton cloth in the factory's cloth yard was only 87% before the preparation for the convening of the representative assembly, while in April it had reached more than 98%.

### 武汉裕华纱厂开好了职工代表大会　领导同群众关系融洽　职工生产积极性高涨

　　武汉裕华纱厂开好了职工代表大会
　　领导同群众关系融洽　职工生产积极性高涨
    本报讯　武汉公私合营裕华纱厂领导干部的办公室里常常有工人进去谈问题。过去，工人们多是来要求工厂替他们解决个人生活、工作方面的问题。有时候，因为工人们提的要求超过了实际的可能性，有时候，因为领导干部没有认真考虑工人的意见，双方常常谈不到一起，有时候甚至发生争吵。最近，情况却有了显著的变化。到办公室里来的工人还不少，但是绝大多数却是来反映工作情况，同领导干部商量如何改进各方面的工作。引起这一变化的原因是厂里在3月份召开了一次职工代表大会。
    这次职工代表大会是作为职工参加企业管理和对企业行政领导进行群众监督的机构而召开的。开会以前，代表们组成五个检查组，分别深入全厂各个部门检查、研究了生产、财务、劳动纪律、生活福利等方面的问题。大会开会期间，代表们围绕着增产节约这一中心议题，充分发扬民主，实事求是地批评了工厂领导工作中的一些官僚主义作风，同时也反对了少数职工中的一些不遵守劳动纪律和对生活福利提出过高的要求等不良现象。会后，领导干部和职工群众都感到在思想上提高了一大步，彼此之间的关系进一步密切起来。
　　领导干部思想一下子清醒了
    裕华纱厂在过去，特别是去年，完成计划的情况比较好，领导干部也比较注意运用群众路线的工作方法。因此，这个厂的领导干部虽然认为工作中可能有些官僚主义，但总觉得问题不大。这次职工代表大会上，代表们一方面肯定了工厂各方面的成绩，一方面也诚恳地提出了一百多条有关生产、生活等方面的意见。这些意见中有不少是领导干部过去没有了解到、没有考虑到的问题。例如，他们一向认为厂里的原棉管理工作很细致，是各项技术管理工作中的“王牌”，但是经过职工代表检查以后，发现工厂制订的原棉管理制度并没有在工人中严格地贯彻执行。对于职工生活福利方面的问题，过去他们总认为群众的困难，他们是知道的，能办到的事情也大都已经办了。但是，这次大会上代表们却提出了不少是可以办到而没有办的事，还批评了有些干部住宅用电用水不花钱的不合理现象。这些意见使领导干部的思想大大清醒了一下。这个厂的经理说：过去批评我一百个官僚主义，也不知道官僚主义在什么地方，这次虽然受了批评，却感到批评得很对。最近，工厂已经根据代表大会提出的意见，制订出了各种改进工作的制度和办法。
　　工人中不合理的要求消除了
    这个厂的一部分工人，过去曾经提出过一些过高的或者不太合理的生活福利方面的要求。例如有的工人因为不了解建筑材料紧张的情况，要求厂里将原计划在今年第三季度盖的宿舍提早在第二季度修建；原动部抬煤工人为了图方便，曾经要求把三班轮流使用一套雨衣、胶鞋，改为一班用一套等。经过领导干部在代表大会上讲清了国家和工厂当前的困难以后，这些意见绝大部分都消除了。厂内原有少数工人工作不安心，闹工资待遇问题，劳动纪律不好，以前虽经领导干部批评教育，也没有多大改变。代表大会期间，广大职工和代表们主动揭发和批评了这些不正确的思想和行为，现在很多人有了转变。
    代表大会以后，职工生产积极性空前高涨。梳棉工序保全工人过去检修机器的质量，从来没有百分之百地合乎标准；代表大会以后，第一次检修出了完全合乎标准的机器。并条工序的黄桶翻面操作法曾经推广了一年多没有推广开，代表大会以后，因为工人们主动要求学习，现在已经全面推广。这个厂布场的棉布上等品率在酝酿召开代表大会以前还只有87％，而4月份已达到98％以上。（曹厚德）
