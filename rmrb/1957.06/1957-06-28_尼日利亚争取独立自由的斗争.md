　　Nigeria's Struggle for Independence and Freedom
　　Chen Yuchu Tian Changsong
    Nigeria is a British colony in West Africa. Administratively, it is divided into three regions: Eastern, Western, and Northern. The Nigerian people have waged a long struggle for independence and freedom. In May of this year, Britain was forced to receive a 43-member Nigerian delegation to hold a conference in London on the steps towards Nigerian independence. The delegation included the premiers of the three Nigerian regions. At this meeting, the Eastern Regional Premier Azikiwe and the Western Regional Premier Awolowo both demanded immediate self-government, while the Northern Regional Premier Ahmadu did not demand immediate self-government, but joined the Eastern and Western regions in demanding full Nigerian independence in 1959. The conference lasted thirty-three days, and as a result, Britain refused the Nigerian people's demand for independence in 1959, apart from agreeing to grant autonomy to Eastern and Western Nigeria, and would only agree to "consider" the issue in 1960.
    Since occupying Lagos (the capital of Nigeria) in 1861, Britain has promulgated five constitutions in Nigeria, amended the constitution five times, and held two constitutional conferences. Although these were all measures taken by the British colonialists to ease the resistance of the Nigerian people, they reflected the intensity of the Nigerian people's opposition to British colonial oppression and were important events in the Nigerian national independence movement. Judging from this London conference, the Nigerian people are clearly no longer satisfied with piecemeal "amendments" to the constitution, but are demanding self-government and independence in the near future. This is a major development in the Nigerian movement for national independence.
    Nigeria is bordered by the Gulf of Guinea to the south and by French African colonies to the east, west, and north. It covers an area of 877,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 32 million, making it Britain's largest remaining colony.
    Like other African countries, Nigeria has long suffered from the enslavement and exploitation of colonialists. As early as 1472, Portuguese ships invaded the Bight of Benin. British colonizers arrived in Nigeria in 1553. Together, they engaged in the dirty business of selling slaves and plundered Nigeria's abundant resources. In 1861, the British forced the Yoruba chief to sign a treaty, seized Lagos, and declared it a colony of the British Crown; at the same time, the area west of Lagos inhabited by the Yoruba people was turned into a British protectorate subordinate to Lagos. In 1879, the British established the "United African Company" in Nigeria, which, like the "East India Company," sucked the blood and sweat of the Nigerian people. In 1885, the "United African Company" obtained a royal charter from the British government, changed its name to the "Royal Niger Company," and began plundering wealth in the northern part of Nigeria. In the same year, Britain established the "Oil Rivers Protectorate" in the Niger River Delta and its eastern regions. Later, Britain expanded further into the interior of Nigeria and later renamed it the "Niger Coast Protectorate." In 1900, Britain announced the establishment of two "protectorates" directly under the British Crown in southern and northern Nigeria, namely the "Northern Nigeria Protectorate" and the "Southern Nigeria Protectorate." In 1906, Lagos was merged into Southern Nigeria. In 1914, Britain merged these two parts into the "Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria." Since then, Nigeria has become an administratively unified country. By 1922, the western part of the former German colony of Cameroon became a British mandate, which was changed to a British trusteeship in 1946 and placed under the administration of Nigeria. In October 1954, according to the Nigerian Provisional Constitution, the "Federation of Nigeria" was established, governed by a federal governor appointed by Britain.
    The British colonialists used a "divide and rule" policy to artificially divide Nigeria into three regions, East, West, and North, each with regional governments and regional parliaments, with the British "regional governors" directly in control. The whole of Nigeria has a Federal Parliament, a Federal Council of Ministers and a Federal Governor-General, with the Federal Governor-General directly leading the Federal Council of Ministers.
    Nigeria has abundant resources and minerals. The north produces peanuts, tin, and livestock. Peanut production accounts for a quarter of Africa's total peanut production, making it one of the world's most important peanut-producing areas. The coastal area running east-west in the south is rich in cocoa, palm products, and timber. Nigeria's cocoa production ranked third in the world in 1952-1953. Recently, large deposits of oil and uranium have been discovered in Nigeria. Nigeria's rich resources are controlled by British monopoly capitalists. Half of the tin mining is operated by the British "Amalgamated Tin Mines of Nigeria," while coal and other mineral mining is also controlled by British monopoly capital and large companies such as the "United African Company."
    The Nigerian people have long lived in extreme poverty under the cruel oppression of colonialism. According to statistics, the average annual income per person is only 20 pounds. The income of the vast majority of workers is less than half of what is needed for a minimum standard of living. Illiteracy accounts for 95% of the country's population. There are only 509 doctors in the country, and half of the children under the age of six die of hunger.
    With the development of the Nigerian people's struggle for national independence, several nationalist parties emerged in Nigeria during and after World War II. In 1944, the first Nigerian nationalist party, the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons," emerged. The leader of this party was the Eastern Regional Premier Azikiwe. The party advocated that Nigeria become an independent and unified country within the British Commonwealth, opposed the colonial constitution, and opposed the imperialist policy of divide and rule in Nigeria. Its main activities were in the eastern region, but it also had a great influence in the west. The "Action Group" was founded in 1950, and its leader was the Western Regional Premier Awolowo. The main strength of the "Action Group" was in the western Yoruba region, representing Yoruba nationalism and ethnic interests. The leader of the "Northern People's Congress" was the Northern Regional Premier Ahmadu. This party had opposed the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons" and demanded that the North and the other regions of Nigeria have the right to separate. The "Northern Elements Progressive Union" was the opposition party to the "Northern People's Congress." It advocated reforming the system of "indirect rule," demanded the implementation of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights guaranteeing action, assembly, freedom of speech and publication, and advocated elections by secret ballot for the people of the Northern region. Its influence is growing in northern Nigeria.
    Although these Nigerian parties do not entirely agree on their political views, they have all participated in leading the struggle for national independence. The third amendment to the Nigerian Constitution in 1946 was carried out under the leadership of the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons." Later, because the amended constitution failed to meet the people's demands, large-scale strikes and demonstrations broke out across the country under the leadership of the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons." In September 1953, "Action Group" members of parliament in the western region moved in the Federal Parliament that the British government allow Nigeria to implement self-government in 1956. This motion was supported by the "Action Group" and the "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons." Subsequently, a huge movement for national self-determination was launched across the country. Their slogan was: "One country, one destiny, one constitution." Under such strong pressure from the nationalist movement, Britain was forced to make concessions, and subsequently convened the Second Nigerian Constitutional Conference in London and Lagos in August 1953 and January 1954, respectively. Representatives of Nigeria's major nationalist parties attended the conference. The conference approved a provisional constitution and agreed that this constitution must be reconsidered in 1956. At that time, Britain declared that if any region made a request by 1956, Britain would grant that region the right to internal self-government, but still retain the status and powers of the federal government.
    More than three years have passed since that conference. During this period, the situation in West Africa, like many parts of Asia and Africa, has undergone great changes. In particular, the independence of Ghana has inspired the Nigerian people with greater courage to fight for national independence. The Nigerian people urgently demand the realization of national independence. On March 26, 1957, the Nigerian Federal House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution to strive for independence within the Commonwealth in 1959. On April 16, the three regional premiers, that is, the leaders of the three major parties, held a meeting in the capital Lagos to actively prepare for this constitutional conference. The Nigerian people had high hopes for this London conference, but the result was rejected by Britain, and only a limited agreement was reached. This approach by Britain is clearly inconsistent with the desire of the Nigerian people for independence and freedom, and will only arouse greater opposition to it from the Nigerian people.
    However, history is advancing, Africa is advancing, and Nigeria is also advancing; although the colonialists have repeatedly adopted delaying tactics, they cannot stop the Nigerian people from advancing on the road to national independence. (Attached picture)

　　尼日利亚争取独立自由的斗争
　　陈聿初  田长松
    尼日利亚是西非的一个英国殖民地。它在行政上被分为东部、西部、北部三个地方。尼日利亚人民为争取独立自由，曾进行了长期的斗争。今年5月，英国被迫接待了一个由四十三人组成的尼日利亚代表团，在伦敦举行尼日利亚独立步骤问题的会议。代表团的代表包括尼日利亚三个地方总理。在这个会议上，东部地方总理阿齐克韦和西部地方总理阿沃卢瓦，都要求立即实行自治，而北部地方总理艾哈迈德则不要求现在就实行自治，但和东、西部两地方一起要求在1959年实行全尼日利亚的独立。这个会议开了三十三天，结果英国除同意给予尼日利亚东部和西部以自治权外，竟拒绝了尼日利亚人民在1959年独立的要求，并且要到1960年才同意“考虑”这个问题。
    英国自1861年占领拉各斯（尼日利亚的首都）到现在，已在尼日利亚颁布过五个宪法，修改过五次宪法，并举行过两次制宪会议。这些虽然都是英国殖民主义者为了缓和尼日利亚人民反抗而采取的手段，但却反映了尼日利亚人民反对英国殖民压迫的激烈程度，是尼日利亚民族独立运动中的重要事件。从这次伦敦会议看来，尼日利亚人民显然已不满足于枝枝节节地“修改”宪法，而要求实行自治，并于最近的将来实行独立。这是尼日利亚争取民族独立运动的重大发展。
    尼日利亚南临几内亚湾，东、西、北三面同法属非洲殖民地接壤，面积八十七万七千平方公里，人口约三千二百万，是英国残存的最大殖民地。
    尼日利亚与其他非洲国家一样，长期遭受殖民主义者的奴役和压榨。早在1472年，葡萄牙船只就侵入到本宁湾。英国殖民者在1553年来到了尼日利亚。他们在这里共同干着那贩卖奴隶的肮脏勾当，并掠夺尼日利亚的丰富物产。1861年，英国人强迫约鲁巴族酋长签订了一个条约，强占了拉各斯，把它宣布为英王的殖民地；同时把拉各斯以西约鲁巴人居住的地区变成英国的保护地，隶属于拉各斯。1879年，英国在尼日利亚成立了“联合非洲公司”，就像“东印度公司”一样，它吸吮着尼日利亚人民的血汗。1885年，“联合非洲公司”获得了英国政府的皇家特许状，改名为“皇家尼日尔公司”，开始在尼日利亚的北部地方掠夺财富。同年，英国又在尼日尔河三角洲及其以东地方建立了“石油河保护国”。以后英国再向尼日利亚内地扩张，后又改名为“尼日尔沿岸保护国”。1900年，英国宣布在尼日利亚南部和北部成立两个直属英王的“保护国”，即“北尼日利亚保护国”和“南尼日利亚保护国”。1906年并把拉各斯并入南尼日利亚。1914年，英国把这两部分合并为“尼日利亚殖民地保护国”。从此，尼日利亚才成为一个行政上统一的国家。到1922年，前德国殖民地喀麦隆的西部变成英国委任统治地，1946年改为英国的托管地，并划归尼日利亚管理。1954年10月，根据尼日利亚临时宪法，成立了“尼日利亚联邦”，由英国任命的联邦总督管辖。
    英国殖民主义者使用“分而治之”的政策，把尼日利亚人为地划分为东、西、北三个地区，都设有地区政府和地区议会，由英国的“地区总督”直接掌握大权。全尼日利亚设有联邦议会、联邦部长会议和联邦总督，由联邦总督直接领导联邦部长会议。
    尼日利亚有丰富的物产和矿藏。北部生产花生、锡、牲畜。花生的产量占整个非洲花生产量的四分之一，为世界上重要花生产地之一。南部横贯东西的沿海地带盛产可可、棕榈和木材。尼日利亚可可的产量在1952—1953年居世界第三位。最近，尼日利亚发现了大量的石油和铀矿。尼日利亚富饶的物产都掌握在英国垄断资本家的手里。锡矿的开采有一半是由英商“尼日利亚混合锡矿公司”经营，煤和其它矿产的开采也掌握在英国垄断资本和“联合非洲公司”等大公司手中。
    尼日利亚人民长期以来在殖民主义的残酷压榨下，生活十分贫困。据统计，每人每年的平均收入只有二十英镑。绝大多数工人的收入还不及最低生活水平所需的一半。文盲占全国人口的95％。全国只有五百零九名医生，六岁以下的儿童有半数死于饥饿。
    随着尼日利亚人民要求民族独立斗争的发展，在第二次世界大战期间和战后，尼日利亚出现了好几个民族主义政党。1944年，出现了第一个尼日利亚民族主义政党——“尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议”。这个党的领袖，就是东部地区总理阿齐克韦。这个党主张尼日利亚在英联邦内成为一个独立统一的国家，反对殖民地宪法，反对帝国主义在尼日利亚的分治政策。它的主要活动在东部地区，可是在西部也有很大的影响。“行动派”成立于1950年，领袖是西部地区总理阿沃卢瓦。“行动派”的主要力量在西部约鲁巴地区，代表约鲁巴人的民族主义和种族利益。“北方人民大会”的领袖是北部地区总理艾哈迈德。这个党曾反对过“尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议”的主张，要求北部和尼日利亚各地区有分离的权利。“北部进步分子联盟”是“北方人民大会”的反对派。它主张改革“间接统治”的制度，要求实行联合国保障行动、集会、言论和出版自由的人权宣言，并主张北部地区人民通过秘密投票进行选举。它在尼日利亚北部地区的影响日益扩大。
    尼日利亚的这些政党，在政见上虽还不尽一致，但都参加领导了民族独立的斗争。1946年尼日利亚宪法的第三次修改，就是在“尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议”领导下进行的。后来因修改后的宪法不能满足人民的要求，在“尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议”的领导下，全国各地不断发生了大规模的罢工和示威。1953年9月，西部地区的“行动派”议员在联邦议会里提出动议，要求英国政府在1956年让尼日利亚实行自治。这个动议得到了“行动派”和
  “尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议”的支持。接着全国掀起了一个巨大的争取民族自决的运动。他们的口号是：“一个国家，一个命运，一个宪法”。在这样强大的民族主义运动压力下，英国被迫让步，遂于1953年8月和1954年1月，先后在伦敦和拉各斯召开了第二次尼日利亚宪法会议。尼日利亚的几个主要民族主义政党的代表都出席了这次会议。会议批准了一个临时宪法，并商定在1956年必须重新考虑这个宪法。当时英国宣称，到1956年如果任何一个地区提出要求，英国将给予这个地区以内部自治的权利，但仍保留联邦政府的地位和权能。
    从那次会议以后已经过了三年多。在这一段时间里，西非的形势跟亚非地区许多地方一样，发生了很大的变化。尤其是加纳的独立，鼓舞着尼日利亚人民为要求民族独立而斗争的更大勇气。尼日利亚人民迫切地要求实现民族独立。1957年3月26日，尼日利亚联邦众议院一致通过决议，争取在1959年取得在英联邦内的独立。4月16日，三个地区总理，即三大政党领袖，在首都拉各斯举行会议，积极为这次宪法会议作了准备。尼日利亚人民对这次伦敦会议本来寄予很大的希望，但结果遭到英国的拒绝，而只达成了有限的协议。英国的这种作法，显然是不符合尼日利亚人民要求独立自由的愿望的，只会激起尼日利亚人民对它的更加反对。
    然而，历史在前进，非洲在前进，尼日利亚也在前进；尽管殖民主义者一再采取拖延手法，都阻止不了尼日利亚人民在争取民族独立道路上前进。（附图片）
