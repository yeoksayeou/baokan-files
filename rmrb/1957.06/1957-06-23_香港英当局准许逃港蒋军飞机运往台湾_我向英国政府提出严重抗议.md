Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Today, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, lodging a serious protest regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' permission on March 22nd of this year for the Chiang Kai-shek clique to transport to Taiwan the Chiang military F-86 fighter jet which fled to Hong Kong on January 31st of last year to escape pursuit by our air force. It also pointed out that the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities must bear all consequences arising from openly condoning the Chiang Kai-shek clique's use of Hong Kong to threaten China's security.

Regarding this incident, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as early as January 31st, the day the incident occurred, and again on February 4th of last year, verbally notified and sent a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires, requesting the British government to detain the Chiang military aircraft and the personnel on board. However, the British government, disregarding international practice and the legitimate demands of our government, actually permitted the pilot of the aircraft, Li Sheng-lin, to return to Taiwan on March 12th of last year. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest against this in its reply note to the British Chargé d'Affaires on March 16th of last year, and once again firmly demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities detain the aircraft and not hand it over to Taiwan in any way, and declared that our government cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek clique's use of Hong Kong to threaten China's security being condoned. The British government has not yet replied to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of March 16th of last year. Now, the British government has once again disregarded our government's solemn statement and legitimate demands, and has permitted the Chiang Kai-shek clique to transport the aircraft to Taiwan. This is yet another extremely unfriendly act by the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities towards the Chinese government and people, and cannot but arouse the protest and condemnation of the Chinese people.

　　香港英当局准许逃港蒋军飞机运往台湾
    我向英国政府提出严重抗议
    新华社22日讯　今日我外交部照会英国驻华代办处，对于香港英国当局在今年3月22日准许蒋介石集团将去年1月31日为逃避我空军追击逃降香港的蒋军F—86型战斗机运往台湾一事，提出了严重抗议，并且指出：英国政府和香港英国当局必须承担由于公然纵容蒋介石集团利用香港威胁中国安全所引起的一切后果。
    关于这一事件，我外交部早在去年1月31日事件发生的当天和2月4日先后口头通知和照会英国代办处，要求英国政府扣留该蒋军飞机和机上人员。但是，英国政府不顾国际惯例和我国政府的正当要求，竟在去年3月12日准许该机驾驶员李盛林返回台湾。我外交部在去年3月16日给英国代办处的复照中对此提出了严重抗议，再度坚决要求香港英国当局将该机予以扣留，不得以任何方式交予台湾，并声明：我国政府不能容忍蒋介石集团利用香港威胁中国安全的行为得到纵容。英国政府对我外交部去年3月16日的照会迄未答复。现在，英国政府竟再次不顾我国政府的严正声明和正当要求，又准许蒋介石集团将该机运往台湾。这是英国政府和香港英国当局对中国政府和人民又一次极不友好的行为，不能不引起中国人民的抗议和谴责。
