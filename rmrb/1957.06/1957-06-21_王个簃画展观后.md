Becoming a flower and vegetable painter who forms his own unique style is no simple task. First, one must be determined, unafraid of difficulties, and diligently practice. In addition to being good at learning painting principles, techniques, and works, and being good at observing the physics, emotions, and states of objects, one must also put in a lot of hard work in poetry, calligraphy, epigraphy; and "discarding shortcomings of teachers" (Song Liu Daochun's "Holy Dynasty Famous Painting Critique" discusses "six essentials") is the key to breaking through the teacher's inheritance and creating new ideas. The one hundred and twenty pieces of flower and vegetable paintings by Mr. Wang Geyi recently exhibited at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall are the result of his research in this way. In recent years, the few young people I have come into contact with who are learning to paint always claim to be a new force, first wanting me to value them, and then wanting me to point out the tricks without reservation. At the same time, they emphasize their time, manpower, and material conditions, etc. After I have explained and demonstrated to him verbally and practically, revealing all my hidden tricks, he still only talks and doesn't practice, and can't even produce a series of exercises. I would like the young people who are determined to learn painting to humbly and honestly look at the painting exhibition of the old painter Wang Geyi, who has inherited from his teachers but has formed his own unique style!

Mr. Geyi's paintings are rarely seen in Beijing. He is from Haimen, Jiangsu, and is sixty-one years old this year, living in Shanghai for a long time. In his early years, he studied painting with the great modern painter Wu Changshuo and is the successor of Mr. Wu Changshuo's style and charm. Mr. Wu's paintings are loved by the people for their grandeur, boldness, and simplicity. However, the subject matter of his creations is not broad enough. Mr. Geyi first expanded the subject matter to the more common and fresher flowers and fruits. Because the old painter had a deeper understanding and feeling of these fresh flowers and fruits, he developed his own set of techniques in terms of expression and was unwilling to strictly adhere to the teacher's inheritance. We can study his exhibited works, such as "Scarlet Sage," "Bouquet of Roses," "Canna," "Summer Heat Relief," "Azalea," "Collection of Scenes on the Desk," etc., the novel layout, bright colors, and simple brushwork, all contain a thriving vitality. It is not difficult to imagine that the secret to the old painter's achievements is the result of his hard work and painstaking research. Just talking without practice will never work.

　　王个簃画展观后
　　于非暗
    成为一个自成一家的花卉蔬果画家，并不是什么简单的事。首先要下定决心，不怕艰难，苦练勤修。除去要善于学习画理、画法、画迹，除去要善于观察物理、物情、物态之外，还必须对诗文金石书法痛下一番苦工夫；而“师学舍短”（宋刘道醇“圣朝名画评”论“六要”），更是冲破师承，别创新意的关键所在。最近在北京美术展览馆所展出一百二十件王个簃先生花卉蔬果画，就是他这样钻研出来的。近年来就我所接触到极其个别的学画青年，总是自命为新生力量，先要我重视，然后要我毫无保留的指出窍门，同时，还强调他时间、人力、物力的条件等等，等到我为他口讲手画，连包袱底都抖落出来之后，他还是光说不练空喊一番，连篇习作都拿他不出。我愿意有志于学画的青年们，虚心的老老实实的看看王个簃老画师师承有自，而独自成家的画展吧！
    个簃老画师的画，在北京很少见。他是江苏海门人，现年六十一岁，久居上海。在早年从近代大画家吴昌硕先生学画，是吴昌硕先生笔情墨趣的衣钵传人。吴先生的画笔，是以大气磅礴、雄浑古朴为人民所喜爱的。但是创作题材不够广阔。个簃老画师首先把题材推广到人民所常见更新鲜的花朵与果实。由于老画师更加深刻的理解与感受这些新鲜的花朵与果实，从而在表现技法上就锻炼出自己的一套手法而不肯谨守师承。我们试从他展出的作品当中研究一下，例如“一串红”、“月季一束”、“蟑螂花”、“消暑图”、“映山红”、“案头集景”等等，新颖的布局，明朗的设色，简净的笔墨，孕育着欣欣向荣的活力。不难想像，老画家成就的窍门，是他辛勤劳动、刻苦钻研的结果，光说不练是万万不成的。（附图片）
