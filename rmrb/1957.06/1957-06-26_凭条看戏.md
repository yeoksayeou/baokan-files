A Snapshot

	Watching Plays with IOUs

	Last year, the Tangshan Pingju Troupe of Hebei Province received a total of fifty-two letters of introduction for watching plays while performing in the rural areas of Qian’an and Qianxi counties.

	Wang Daqi, of the Xinji Township People's Committee in Qianxi County, issued six notes in one day on January 6, introducing a total of two hundred and eight people to watch free plays, all under the pretext of "amateur theater troupes learning from experience."

	"Hereby introduce a total of forty-five members of the Quanzhuang Village amateur theater troupe to attend your performance tonight, hoping to be granted free tickets for the purpose of learning experience. Hoping for this."

	Agricultural cooperative directors, shares of agricultural cooperatives, and even individuals could issue notes to watch plays.

	"Comrade Lao Wei:
		Hereby introduce members of the Qinjian Cooperative Management Committee, twenty-four people, to see your troupe's performance tonight. Hoping you will receive them upon seeing this letter. Much appreciated.  Director Li Fangzhi"

	"Hereby introduce a total of five cadres from our cooperative, hoping you will receive them upon seeing this letter. Much appreciated.
		Qinjian Agricultural Production Cooperative Accounting Share, Shaheyi Township"

	"Hereby there are six cadres from our village. They have already watched during the daytime today. They are still coming to watch tonight. Hoping you will allow them to enter and watch! Please receive them. Much appreciated.
			Shaheyi Village Responsible Person Guo Yulai"

	The Luo Jiatun Township People's Committee in Qianxi County issued a total of seven notes on December 20, introducing a total of one hundred and thirty people to watch free plays, with the reason being "doing security work." It is truly strange, a theater troupe performing in the countryside actually requires more than one hundred laborers to "do security work"? To put it mildly, it is watching free plays; to put it harshly, isn't it a bit like extortion?

　　凭条看戏
    河北省唐山市评剧三团去年在迁安、迁西两县农村演出，一共收到五十二封看戏介绍信。
    迁西县新集乡人民委员会王大祺在1月6日一天里就开了六张条子，共介绍二百零八人去看白戏，所用借口都是“业余剧团学习经验”。
    “兹介绍泉庄村业余剧团共四十五名，在今晚上去参加你场观剧，为了学习经验希给予免票是盼。”
    农业合作社主任、农业社的一个股甚至个人都可以开条看戏。
    “老魏同志：
    兹介绍勤俭社管理委员会委员，今晚去您剧团看戏，二十四人，希见信接洽，是荷。  主任李芳之”
    “兹介绍我社干部共五人，希见字接洽是荷。
    沙河驿乡勤俭农业生产合作社会计股”
    “兹有我村干部六名，他们在今天白天已经看着。今晚还是来看，希叫他们入场去看吧！请接洽是荷。
            沙河驿村负责人郭玉来”
    迁西县罗家屯乡人民委员会在12月20日共开出了七张条子，共介绍了一百三十个人去看白戏，理由是“作保卫工作”。真奇怪，一个剧团到农村演戏，居然需要一百多个民工来“作保卫工作”？说得好听些，是看白戏，说得不好听些，不是有点佯讹诈了么？
