　　"United Nations Commander" and US Defense Authorities Confirm
    US Intends to Turn Korea into a Nuclear Base
    Nine Cities in Korea Condemn US for Undermining the Armistice Agreement
    This newspaper provides combined reports. According to Xinhua News Agency: The American General George Decker, who is about to take over as "United Nations Commander," once again confirmed the US conspiracy to turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare during a conversation with a United Press reporter in Tokyo on June 27.
    Decker said that when the United States decides to transport atomic cannons and "Honest John" rockets to South Korea for use by the US military, he will "strongly advocate" giving the Syngman Rhee army atomic weapons training.
    He also said that the US Far East Command and the US Department of Defense have "generally" determined the quantity and nature of most of the new weapons stipulated for Syngman Rhee. At the same time, the US Department of Defense is still discussing the issue of supplying Syngman Rhee with nuclear weapons.
    On the same day, US Secretary of Defense Wilson announced in Washington that the United States does not prohibit the transportation of new weapons such as missiles into South Korea. He indicated that South Korean troops will receive modernized weapons and will be trained in the use of such weapons. However, nuclear warheads will not be handed over to them.
    US defense authorities revealed on the same day that the two US Army divisions in South Korea will receive dual-purpose weapons to enable them to quickly possess the power to conduct atomic warfare.
    According to the International News Service, before transporting "real battlefield weapons" capable of carrying nuclear warheads into South Korea, training work for the US military in South Korea will be conducted with fake weapons. Most of the US troops currently in South Korea have received tactical training in the "five atomic division" system in the United States.
    The International News Service also revealed that the US military authorities occupying South Korea are preparing to recommend convening the Military Armistice Commission again and unilaterally announce at this meeting that they will not submit reports on the import of new types of weapons to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, in order to completely undermine the provisions of Article 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    This news agency said that news that new jet aircraft have been transported into South Korea has been circulating in Seoul, but the US military authorities are still keeping it a secret. The reason why the United States is publicizing the postponement of the transportation of new weapons into South Korea is because it is "unwilling to satisfy the provisions of the armistice agreement," that is, to report in detail the entry of weapons to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
    According to reports from Pyongyang: On June 26, people from nine cities, including Kaesong, Sinuiju, Wonsan, Chongjin, and Hamhung, held mass rallies to resolutely oppose the US actions of undermining the armistice agreement and transporting new types of weapons into South Korea, and to support the statement issued by the Republic government on the same day.
    A total of more than 300,000 people participated in the mass rallies in the nine cities. Slogans such as "Yankee robbers, get out of Korea" and "Korea is the Korea of the Korean people" resounded throughout the land.

　　“联合国军司令”和美国防当局证实
    美国想把朝鲜变为原子基地
    朝鲜九个城市谴责美国破坏停战协定
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：即将接任“联合国军司令”的美国将军乔治·德克尔6月27日在东京向合众社记者谈话的时候，再一次证实了美国企图把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地的阴谋。
    德克尔说，在美国决定把原子大炮和“诚实的约翰”式火箭运到南朝鲜去供美军使用的时候，他将“竭力主张”给予李承晚军队以原子武器训练。
    他还说，美军远东司令部和美国国防部已经“大体上”决定了规定给李承晚的大多数新武器的数量和性质，同时，美国国防部还在讨论关于供给李承晚核武器的问题。
    同一天，美国国防部长威尔逊在华盛顿宣布，美国并不禁止把导弹等新武器运入南朝鲜。他表示，南朝鲜部队将得到现代化武器，并且将受到使用这种武器的训练。但是不会把原子弹头交给他们。
    美国国防当局在同一天透露，在南朝鲜的两个美国陆军师将得到有双重用途的武器，以便使它们迅速拥有进行原子战争的力量。
    据国际新闻社报道，在把能够携带原子弹头的“真正野战武器”运进南朝鲜以前，南朝鲜美军的训练工作将用假武器进行。目前在南朝鲜的大多数美国军队都在美国国内受过“五原子编制”师的战术训练。
    国际新闻社并且透露，占领南朝鲜的美军当局正在准备建议再一次召开军事停战委员会，并且在这次会议上片面宣布不向中立国监察委员会提出关于输入新型武器的报告，以彻底破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项的规定。
    这家通讯社说，汉城已经流传着新的喷气式飞机已经运进南朝鲜的消息，但是美军当局还在保守秘密。美国所以宣传将推迟把新武器运进南朝鲜是由于“不愿意去满足停战协定的规定”，即向中立国监察委员会详细报告运入武器的情况。
    另据平壤消息：开城、新义州、元山、清津、咸兴等九个城市的人民6月26日分别举行群众大会，坚决反对美国破坏停战协定、把新型武器运入南朝鲜的行为，并且支持共和国政府当天发表的声明。
    九个城市的群众大会共约有三十多万人参加。“美国强盗滚出朝鲜”、“朝鲜是朝鲜人民的朝鲜”等口号响遍各地。
