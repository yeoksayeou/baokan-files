Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: Japanese Justice Minister Umeji Nakamura said yesterday that despite the United States taking action to invoke habeas corpus, the trial of U.S. soldier Girard, who killed a Japanese woman, will proceed.

　　Nakamura explained that the Habeas Corpus Act does not affect the trial of Girard under the administrative agreement based on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

　　He said that the Japanese court authorities will only request Girard's presence in court when the defendant is required to appear for trial.

　　Girard's American lawyer had filed an application with the U.S. court based on the so-called Habeas Corpus Act, requesting that Girard be returned to the United States for trial by the U.S. court. U.S. Federal Judge McGarraghy signed an order on June 6th, stipulating that the U.S. authorities should temporarily not hand Girard over to the Japanese authorities for trial. Prior to this, the U.S. government had been forced to agree to Girard's trial in Japan.

　　According to reports, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has made a decision at a high-level meeting to request that the Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations, Koto Matsudaira, submit a report on his television remarks in New York regarding the Girard case to reporters. Matsudaira said on television that he could not understand why Japan did not waive its rights in this case as it had in other cases involving U.S. soldiers.

　　According to reports, Foreign Ministry officials believe this matter is serious because Matsudaira commented on issues he was not authorized to address.

    美国政府无权庇护杀人犯
    日本坚要审判哲腊德
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本法务相中村梅吉昨天说，尽管美国就要求应用人身保障法采取行动，对杀死日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德的审判仍将进行。
    中村梅吉解释说：人身保障法并不影响根据以美日安全条约为基础的行政协定对哲腊德举行审判。
    他说，日本法庭当局将只在被告必须出场的时候，才要求哲腊德出席法庭的审判。
    哲腊德的美国律师曾经根据所谓人身保障法向美国法院提出申请，要求把哲腊德调回美国，由美国法院审讯。美国联邦法官麦克格拉基在6月6日签署了命令，规定美国当局暂时不得把哲腊德交给日本当局审讯。在此以前，美国政府曾经被迫同意由日本审讯哲腊德。
    另据报道，日本外务省已经在一次高级会议上作出决定，要求日本驻联合国大使松平康东就他在纽约在电视中发表的关于哲腊德案件的对记者谈话提出报告。松平康东在电视中说，他不能理解日本为什么在这一案件中不像在其他一些涉及美国军人的案件中那样放弃自己的权利。
    据报道，外务省的官员们认为这件事情很严重，因为松平康东对他没有资格过问的问题发表了意见。
