Readers and Distributors Write, Requesting Earlier Newspaper Delivery
Must Be Well-Edited and Published Early

To the Editorial Comrades:

　　In 1955, the publication time of newspapers in our city was very early. But in 1956, problems arose, and newspapers were often not published on time, leading to readers' complaints about the post office and delivery staff. The delivery staff often heard such sarcasm: "The newspapers are still being delivered! Are we supposed to read the noon paper or the evening paper? Why not just deliver them together tomorrow, wouldn't that save a trip?" "We need to read the newspaper every day, but it doesn't arrive until ten o'clock, where do we have time to read it then!"

　　Since December of last year, thanks to the vigorous reforms by various newspaper offices, the publication time of newspapers was once advanced. However, from April of this year until today, the publication time of newspapers has steadily deteriorated. The postal workers' hours have been extended, their work order disrupted, and they are also subject to readers' accusations.

　　I often think this: the personnel and material conditions of the People's Daily should be much better than other newspaper offices! The conclusion should be: "The People's Daily is well-edited and published early!" During the War of Resistance, I worked in Chongqing, and at that time, the New China Daily we subscribed to was always delivered earlier than other newspapers. The newspaper arrived before work even started. How wonderful it would be if we could continue to carry forward that spirit today!

　　Because the People's Daily is published too late, many units have approached your newspaper office, requesting to pick up the newspapers themselves. The newspaper office has directed them to contact the post office and us. Imagine, if the post office doesn't deliver the newspapers and lets tens of thousands of readers pick them up themselves, can we say we've done a good job with distribution! It's simply unprecedented. If we don't accept their self-pickup requests, the newspapers are truly late! If we do accept, and this situation continues to develop, it will indeed be difficult. Moreover, what kind of "unified postal distribution" is this! To have the distribution work become "picking up without delivering" and to have such a page written in future history, wouldn't that be too embarrassing? Please forgive me for repeating myself, that I hope the People's Daily "must be well-edited and published early"! Please satisfy the demands of tens of millions of readers! How eagerly we await the early arrival of this day!

Don't Blame the Post Office, Blame the Newspaper Office

To the Editorial Comrades:

　　I am an external mail clerk at the Qianmen branch of the People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch. A month ago, I could reliably receive the People's Daily every morning between 6:15 and 6:20 AM, which allowed me to understand the current domestic and international situation as early as possible. Many of our bank's cadres, in order to read the People's Daily earlier, waited at the entrance every morning at six o'clock, and they were accustomed to this lifestyle. However, recently the newspaper's publication time has been delayed, and we often receive the newspaper after eight o'clock. We start work at eight o'clock, and we can use the time before eight o'clock to read the newspaper. If the newspaper arrives at eight o'clock, how can we put down our work to read it? Therefore, many cadres have opinions. They say: in the past, we could see the newspaper every day at 6:30 AM, but now sometimes it's nowhere to be seen around eight o'clock, what a waste of time. Some comrades don't understand the situation and want me to give feedback to the post office, but I think this is not the post office's responsibility, but the newspaper office's responsibility.

　　In order for readers across the country to be able to meet with the People's Daily in a timely manner, I think it is necessary for the People's Daily to restore its original publication time to meet the needs and requirements of readers.

A Daily Newspaper Delivered Only Every Two or Three Days

To the Editorial Comrades:

　　I am a loyal reader of the People's Daily. In the past, I could see the newspaper every day around eleven o'clock in the morning. If I didn't see it for a day, I felt like something was missing from my life. Especially recently, the newspaper's documents on rectification issues need to be seen in a timely manner. However, since June, the People's Daily has been published late, and I have not been able to see it in a timely manner either. Often, it is delivered every two days, or even sometimes every three days. So late and so many, it's really impossible to read. Please study how we can see the People's Daily in a timely manner.

### 读者和发行工作者纷纷来信  要求提早出报

　　读者和发行工作者纷纷来信
    要求提早出报
    既要编得好又要出得早编辑同志：
    1955年，本市各报的出版时间很早。可是1956年就有了问题，报纸经常不能按时出版，读者纷纷责难邮局和投递员。投递员们经常听到这样的讽刺：“报纸还给送呵！这教我们看午报还是看晚报呵！好不好请明天一块送，不是可以少跑一趟吗？”“我们每天要读报，十来点钟才送来，那里还有空读呵！”
    去年12月起，经过各报社的大力改革，报纸出版时间一度提早了。可是从今年4月份起，一直到今天，报纸的出版时间，每况愈下。邮递员的工时拉长、打乱了工作秩序，还要受读者的指责。
    我时常这样想：人民日报的人员条件和物质条件，总该比其他报社优越得多！应该得出这样的结论：“人民日报编得好，出得早！”抗战期间我曾在重庆工作过，那时我们订的新华日报总比别的报送得早，没等上班，报早来了。如果今天也能继续发扬那种精神该多好呵！
    由于人民日报出版太晚，不少单位向你们报社交涉，要求到报社自取报纸，报社已介绍到邮局和我们联系。试想，如果邮局不送报，而让成千上万的读者到邮局自取，我们这发行工作可算做到家了！简直是史无前例。不接受人家自取吧，报是真晚！接受吧，如果这情况发展下去，也的确有困难。而且这叫什么“邮发合一”呢！把发行工作做到“取而不送”，在后日的历史上给写下这样的一页，不是使人太难堪了吗？请恕我再重复一遍，即希望人民日报“既要编得好，又要出得早”！请满足千万读者的要求吧！我们多么迫切地期待着这一天早日来到呀！

    不能怪邮局应该怪报社编辑同志：
    我是中国人民银行北京市分行前门办事处的外收发员。一个月以前，每天早上六点一刻到六点二十分，准能接到人民日报，使我能及早了解当前的国内外的情况。我行很多干部，为了早些读到人民日报，每天早上六点钟就在门口等着，他们对这样的生活也习惯了。可是最近的报纸出版时间晚了，我们收到报纸往往在八点以后。我们是八点上班，在八点钟以前可以利用时间看看报纸，要是等到八点钟来报，我们怎能放下工作而去看报纸呢？因此很多干部都有意见。他们说：从前每天在六点半即可看到报纸，目前竟然有时在八点左右还无踪影，真是白浪费时间。有的同志不了解情况，要我给邮局提意见，我认为这并不是邮局的责任，而是报社的责任。
    为了使全国读者能够及时的和人民日报见面，我认为人民日报有必要恢复原来的出版时间，以满足读者的需要和要求。
                        王全禄
    两三天才送一次的日报编辑同志：
    我是人民日报的忠实读者。过去，每天上午十一点左右，就能看到报纸。如果一天看不到，就感到一天的生活好像缺什么似的。特别是近时报纸关于整风问题的文件，更需及时看到。可是从6月份起，人民日报出版晚了，我也不能及时看到，往往是隔二日一块送来，甚至有时隔三天送一次。又晚又多，真无法看。请你们研究一下，如何才能使我们及时看到人民日报。
