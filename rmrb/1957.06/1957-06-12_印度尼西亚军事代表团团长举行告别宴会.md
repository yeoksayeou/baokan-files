If all countries in the world can dispel suspicion, the prosperity and peace of the world can be reliably guaranteed.

Gatot Soebroto said that China's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is the best policy. He said that under the leadership of the Chinese government, the Chinese people will surely build a prosperous and happy country. He also especially thanked the Chinese people for their hospitality during their visit. He said he hoped for closer meetings in the future.

Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke with a feeling of reluctance to part. He said that the Indonesian Military Friendship Delegation to China, under the leadership of General Gatot Soebroto, made a short but memorable visit to China.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the friendship between the armed forces and people of China and Indonesia is based on the common desire to oppose colonialism and build their respective beautiful homelands. This visit by the Indonesian Military Friendship Delegation has further deepened the friendship between the two peoples and armies.
