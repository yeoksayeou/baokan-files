    Let Me Say a Few Angry Words Too
    Jin YinhuaLet me say a few angry words too. I have some memories, some sorrows, and some joys. I remember back then, at the struggle session against the local tyrant Nan Batian, angry roars rose wave after wave: "Beat to death the counter-revolutionary Nan Batian!" Our parents, brothers, and sisters were slaughtered by him; that person, his ten fingers dripping with blood... That was our tears, our blood, our heart. I jumped up, the people around me jumped up, hundreds of thousands of people all jumped up and rushed to the trial stage: "Come on! Beat to death the counter-revolutionary Nan Batian!" Ah, brothers, we were overjoyed then, the blue sky was without clouds. Alas, alas, brothers, were we wrong back then? Now, they say, the counter-revolutionaries are the masters of China! Ah, is that so? Nan Batian is the master of China?! Brother, come on, let me look at you. You wear a steel helmet, carry a gun, backpack, water bag, and countless things I don't know the names of, and dry rations, at least eighty-eight jin [Note], all night long facing the cold wind, standing on the peak of the motherland's border. I entrust myself to you, I entrust my children and wife to you; you clearly have eyes like knives, distinguishing who is on our side and who is the enemy. Now, why don't you believe your own eyes? Why are you so melancholy? Why do you say you don't know who you are protecting? Alas, alas, they say, the counter-revolutionaries are the masters of China. Ah, does the People's Liberation Army protect counter-revolutionaries? Brothers, I remember those years we dreamed together, no matter what others think, the dreams of hundreds of millions of people must be great; back then, the whips of the Americans and the landlord-bureaucratic capitalists whipped us rolling on the ground, our troubles were as big as the sky, our dreams were also as big as the sky: big red flags flying in the sky, the sky and smokestacks embracing each other, circling our red flag with a whoosh, whoosh spitting out our strong poems—the flame and smoke of steel; we all stood up, carried out the purple-red dawn, and gave it a name, called socialism. Now, oil gurgles singing in our hearts, we make steel, build machines, weave cloth... controlling the evil dragon-like rivers, the fields shimmer with golden oil, boundless, no longer small patches of patched chains. Our children are all wearing pants, and the girls are wearing red blouses; the red blouse is a soaring anthem, singing that seven years surpasses thousands of years, the socialist torrent carries people to eternity, forever. Although we quarrel, argue over work points, argue over pig feed, oppose bureaucracy... but, without the Communist Party, there would be no China, without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism. Brothers, we dreamed together, and together we turned dreams into reality. Was all this wrong? Did we even dream wrong? Now, they say, the counter-revolutionaries are the masters of China, the Communist Party has no share in China. Is that so? Brothers, is the Communist Party more hateful than the counter-revolutionaries?! Brothers, is that so? Is the Communist Party the enemy, and Nan Batian family?!

    请让我也说几句气愤的话吧
    金银花请让我也说几句气愤的话吧，我有些回忆，有些悲哀，也有些欢乐；想当年，在斗争南霸天的大会上，愤怒的吼声一浪接一浪：“打死反革命分子南霸天！”我们的父母、兄弟、姐妹被他屠杀了；那个人，他十个手指血淋淋……那是我们的眼泪，我们的血，我们的心；我跳起来，我前后左右的人们都跳起来十万群众全都跳起来冲到审判台前面：“来啊！打死反革命分子南霸天！”哎，弟兄们我们当时是心花怒放呵，满天青空没有了云。唉，唉，弟兄们，难道我们当初是错了吗？现在，他说，反革命是中国的主人！哎，是吗？南霸天是中国的主人？！兄弟，来吧，让我看看你。你头带钢盔身背枪背包、水袋、还有无数我叫不出名字的东西和干粮至少有八十八斤重〔注〕，整夜整夜地对着寒风，站在祖国边疆的峰顶上。我把我自己交托给你，把我的孩子和老婆交托给你；你分明是两眼像刀子一样，分得清谁是自己人，谁是仇敌。现在，你为什么不相信自己的眼睛了呢？为什么你那样的忧郁？为什么说不知道保卫的是什么人？唉，唉，他说，反革命是中国的主人。哎，难道人民解放军保护的是反革命？弟兄们，我想起那些年我们一起做的梦，不论人家怎样想，几万万人的梦想，会是很大的吧；那时候，美国人和地主官僚资本的鞭子抽得我们满地滚呵，我们的苦恼有天那么大，我们的梦也有天那么大：天上飞着大红旗子，天帏和烟囱交颈拥抱，绕着我们的红旗呼呼地，呼呼地喷出我们强烈的诗篇——钢铁的火焰和烟云；我们全站起来了，抬出了紫艳艳的晨曦，还给它起了个名字，叫做社会主义。现在，石油咕咕地在我们心里歌唱着，我们炼钢、造机器、织布……管制恶蛟一样的河流，原野金油油地闪动着，一望无边，不再是一小块一小块的补钉链。我们的孩子们都穿上裤子了，女孩们还穿上了红布褂；红布褂是一首冲天的高歌，歌唱着七年赛过了几千年，社会主义的洪流把人们载送到永远，永远。虽然我们吵架、争工分、争猪食，反对官僚主义……可是，没有共产党，就没有中国，没有共产党，就没有社会主义。弟兄们，我们一起做过梦，又一起把梦变成了生活。难道这一切都错了吗？难道我们做梦也做错了吗？现在，他说，反革命是中国的主人，共产党对中国没有份。是的吗？弟兄们，共产党比反革命还可恨？！弟兄们，是吗？共产党是仇敌，南霸天是亲人？！
