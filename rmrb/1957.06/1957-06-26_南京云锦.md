Handicraft Introduction

　　Nanjing Yunjin
　　Zhu Qi
　　Nanjing's Yunjin has a history of six or seven hundred years.

　　As early as the thirteenth century, Yunjin began to be produced. At that time, the East and West Weaving and Dyeing Bureaus were established in Nanjing to engage in weaving. The products were sold throughout the country. In the Qing Dynasty, the Jiangning Weaving Office was established in Nanjing. The grandfather and father of Cao Xueqin, the author of "Dream of the Red Chamber," both worked as Jiangning Weavers. At that time, the Yunjin used in the court, such as Ku Jin, Ku Duan, and Zhuang Hua, were all purchased and supplied by the Jiangning Weaving Office. Because of the advocacy of the feudal dynasty, officials and gentry liked to wear Ning silk and tribute satin, and the Yunjin industry flourished for a while. At its peak, there were 30,000 looms and more than 50,000 male and female weavers in Nanjing. The areas east and west of the gate (referring to the east and west sides of Jubaomen) were the concentrated areas of weavers.

　　There are many varieties of Yunjin, which can be roughly divided into Ku Duan, Ku Jin, and Zhuang Hua, with dozens of different styles.

　　During the Kuomintang rule, the Yunjin industry declined greatly, domestic and foreign sales were cut off, and it was in a dying state. After liberation, production resumed. The commodities are sold to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Tibet region, and also sold abroad. The Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Culture has organized some silk weaving experts, art workers, and veteran Yunjin artists to form a "Yunjin Research Group" to conduct preliminary sorting and research on Yunjin patterns and textures.

　　The characteristics of Yunjin are that the patterns are beautiful, the patterns are elegant, the weaving is fine, the colors are bright, and the texture is strong and durable. It is a kind of silk weaving industry in my country with extremely high artistic value.

　　南京云锦

    南京的云锦，已经有六七百年的历史。
    远在十三世纪，云锦即已开始生产，当时在南京设东、西织染局，从事织造。产品行销到全国。到了清朝，更在南京设江宁织造署，“红楼梦”的作者曹雪芹的祖、父两代，都做过江宁织造；当时宫廷里所用的云锦如库锦、库缎、装花等，都由江宁织造署采办供应。因为封建王朝的提倡，官僚士绅们都喜欢穿上宁绸贡缎，云锦业遂盛极一时。最盛的时候，南京有织机三万架，男女织工五万多人，门东、门西（指聚宝门东边和西边）一带，都是织工集中的地方。
    云锦的品种很多，大体可分为库缎、库锦、装花之类，名式繁多，有好几十种。
    在国民党统治时期，云锦业大大衰落，国内外销路断绝，呈奄奄一息的状态。解放后，才恢复生产。商品远销到内蒙古自治区和西藏地区，还销到国外。南京市文化处曾组织一部分丝织专家、美术工作者和云锦老艺人成立了“云锦研究小组”对云锦图案花纹进行初步的整理和研究。
    云锦的特色是，图案美丽，花纹雅致，而且织工精细，光彩鲜明，加以质地坚厚，经久耐用，是我国丝织工业中极有艺术价值的一种。
