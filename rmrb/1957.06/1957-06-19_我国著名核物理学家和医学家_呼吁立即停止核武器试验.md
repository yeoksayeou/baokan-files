　　Our country's prominent nuclear physicists Qian Sanqiang, Zhao Zhongyao, and physicians Fang Shishan and Li Mingxin gave statements to our newspaper's reporter, supporting the resolutions of the World Peace Council's Colombo meeting, calling for the immediate conclusion of an international agreement to cease nuclear weapons testing and the prompt prohibition of nuclear weapons.

　　Qian Sanqiang (Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) said: "The responsibility of nuclear physicists is to discover and master the laws of the atomic nucleus, and to explore its potential for the benefit of human happiness. We are working hard on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The atomic reactor and accelerator that the Soviet Union helped China build, as well as the accelerator and various equipment that China has installed itself, provide favorable conditions for our country's nuclear science research work. In the second Five-Year Plan, China's nuclear science will make a great leap forward. Recently, we attended the Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission, and scientists and organizers from all departments in our country are working hard to improve the conditions for scientific work, so as to better serve our country's socialist construction. However, on the other side of the world, there are still people today who want to provoke a nuclear arms race and use scientific achievements to manufacture weapons of mass slaughter. This makes us deeply saddened. People and upright scientists from all countries have been calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons for many years. Recently, many accomplished scientists in Western countries have also pointed out the threat that the nuclear arms race and nuclear weapons testing pose to mankind. These solemn warnings should not be ignored by anyone. We demand that all countries possessing nuclear weapons immediately conclude an agreement to cease nuclear weapons testing, and further realize the complete prohibition of the use, manufacture, and storage of all types of nuclear weapons."

　　Qian Sanqiang told the reporter that not long ago, when a delegation of Japanese physicists visited China, physicists from China and Japan exchanged views. Because Japan has suffered from the disasters of atomic bomb bombings and hydrogen bomb tests, the vast majority of Japanese people and scientists resolutely oppose atomic weapons and hydrogen bomb tests. Qian Sanqiang said: "In this regard, we completely agree with and warmly support the just attitude of the Japanese people and scientists."

　　Zhao Zhongyao (Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) expressed his support for the recent Soviet proposal to immediately conclude an agreement to cease nuclear weapons explosions for a certain period. He said: "In order to gradually achieve the prohibition of nuclear weapons, concluding such an agreement first would be a good start. Stopping testing is easy to do, and the supervision issue is also relatively simple. Nuclear explosions are, in fact, impossible to conduct in secret. The radioactive particles they produce inevitably spread into the upper atmosphere and circulate with the air currents. Countries with modern scientific equipment can detect them. If a certain number of monitoring posts can also be established, then any violation of the agreement can easily be discovered and stopped."

　　Qian Sanqiang and Zhao Zhongyao both expressed their support for the appeal and declaration passed unanimously by the World Peace Council's Colombo meeting, which called on all governments to immediately cease nuclear testing, and demanded a cessation of nuclear weapons testing and disarmament. They hope that scientists around the world and all peace-loving people will unite closely and fully support these two resolutions.

　　Fang Shishan (Vice President of the Chinese Medical Association) said: "I warmly support the appeal issued by the World Peace Council's Colombo meeting, which calls on all governments to immediately cease nuclear testing. This is the voice of human conscience. I have been engaged in medical work for fifty years. Our wish is to devote our life's energy to protecting human health. Recently, we have seen reports from colleagues in the medical community in various countries, and we know the threat that hydrogen bomb and atomic bomb tests pose to mankind. These tests pollute the air, seawater, and land, and can cause serious diseases such as osteosarcoma and leukemia in animals, and may also affect people's fertility and the health of future generations. This kind of testing should not continue. Our colleagues in the Chinese medical community wholeheartedly support the World Peace Council's appeal. We demand that the governments concerned quickly sign an agreement to immediately cease nuclear weapons testing, and take measures to completely prohibit nuclear weapons."

　　Li Mingxin (Member of the Cancer Occurrence Mechanism Committee of the International Anti-Cancer Association, Professor of Peking Union Medical College) said: "Stopping nuclear weapons testing is now an urgent matter. Every nuclear explosion produces many radioactive materials, which can spread to very distant places. Some isotopes produced by nuclear weapons explosions disappear very slowly. For example, the half-life of Strontium-90 is as long as 19.9 years." He also emphasized the diseases that radiation can cause to animal organisms, and refuted the remarks of some Western scientists who defended nuclear explosion testing. He said: "These scientists say that the average amount of radioactive material produced by each explosion test that falls around the world is very small, and that even if testing continues for several decades, it will not cause any real harm. But in fact, there is a possibility that radioactive materials will fall densely in a certain area, which will cause serious harm. The US government issued a statement on June 1 this year, asking American farmers to prevent radioactive particles from damaging people, livestock, and crops. If the US government is really concerned about the fate of the American people, it should accept the World Peace Council's appeal and the Soviet proposal, and immediately agree to cease nuclear weapons testing, and further completely prohibit nuclear weapons."

### 我国著名核物理学家和医学家  呼吁立即停止核武器试验

　　我国著名核物理学家和医学家
　　呼吁立即停止核武器试验
    本报讯　我国权威的原子核物理学家钱三强、赵忠尧和医学家方石珊、李铭新对本报记者发表谈话，支持世界和平理事会科伦坡会议的决议，呼吁立即缔结停止核武器试验的国际协定并尽速禁止核武器。
    钱三强（中国科学院物理研究所所长）说：“原子核科学家的责任，是发现和掌握原子核的规律，发掘它的潜力为人类幸福服务。我们正在努力于和平利用原子能的工作。苏联帮助我国建立的原子反应堆和加速器和我国自己装置的加速器和各种设备，为我国原子核科学的研究工作提供了有利条件，在第二个五年计划内，我国的原子核科学将大大跃进一步。最近我们出席了国务院科学规划委员会第四次扩大会议，我国各部门的科学家和组织工作者们都在努力设法改善科学工作的条件，以便于更好地使科学服务于我国的社会主义建设的事业。可是在世界的另一方面，今天还有人要挑起原子核军备竞赛，把科学成果用于制造大规模屠杀人类的武器。这是使我们深感痛心的。各国人民和正直的科学家们呼吁禁止原子武器已经有许多年了。最近，西方各国也有许多有成就的科学家指出原子核军备竞赛和核武器试验对人类所带来的威胁。这些严正的警告是任何人不应当忽视的。我们要求拥有核武器的各国，立即缔结一项停止核武器试验的协定，并且进一步实现完全禁止使用、制造和储存各种类型的核武器。”
    钱三强告诉记者，不久以前日本物理学家代表团访问我国的时候，中日两国的物理学家们曾经交换意见。日本由于遭受过原子弹轰炸和氢弹试验的灾害，日本的广大人民和科学家都坚决反对原子武器、反对氢弹试验。钱三强说：“在这一方面，我们完全同意并且热烈地支持日本人民和科学家的正义的态度。”
    赵忠尧（中国科学院物理研究所副所长）对苏联最近提出的立即缔结一项在一定时期内停止核武器爆炸的主张表示支持。他说：“为了逐步实现禁止核武器，先订这样一个协定会是一个好的开始。停止试验容易办到，监督问题也比较简单。原子核爆炸事实上是无法秘密进行的，它所产生的放射性微粒不可避免地要散布到高层大气中去，随着气流循环。拥有现代科学设备的各国，都可以侦察出来。如果还能建立一定的监督哨，那么任何违反协定的情况都很容易被发现而加以制止。”
    对于这次世界和平理事会科伦坡会议所一致通过的要求一切政府立即停止原子核试验的呼吁书和要求停止原子核武器试验和裁军的宣言，钱三强和赵忠尧都表示拥护。他们希望全世界的科学工作者和全体爱好和平的人士紧密团结起来，全力支持这两项决议。
    方石珊（中华医学会副会长）说：“我热烈地拥护世界和平理事会科伦坡会议所发表的要求一切政府立即停止原子核试验的呼吁书。这是代表人类良心的声音。我从事医务工作五十年了。我们的愿望是尽毕生精力来保护人类的健康。最近，我们看到了各国医学界同仁的一些报告，知道氢弹和原子弹试验给人类带来的威胁。这些试验污染空气、海水和土地，能够在动物体中引起像骨瘤、白血病这样严重的疾病，而且还可能影响人们的生育以及后代的健康。这种试验不应当再继续下去了。我国医学界的同仁，都衷心支持世界和平理事会的呼吁。我们要求有关各国政府迅速签订一项立即停止核武器试验的协定，并且采取措施，彻底禁止核武器。”
    李铭新（国际抗癌协会癌瘤发生机制委员会委员、中国协和医学院教授）说：“停止核武器试验，现在已是刻不容缓的事。每一次原子核爆炸都要产生许多放射性物质，这些物质能够散播到很远的地方去。有一些由核武器爆炸产生的同位素，消失极慢。例如锶—90的半衰期长达19.9年。”他也强调指出放射能对动物机体可能造成的疾病，并且驳斥了西方有一些科学家为核爆炸试验辩护的言论。他说：“这些科学家说，每次爆炸试验所产生的放射性物质散落到世界各地的平均量很小，再试验几十年也不会造成实际上的危害。但事实上，放射物质有密集降落到某一地区的可能性，这样就会造成严重的危害。美国政府在今年6月1日曾发表文告，要美国农民预防放射性微粒对人畜和庄稼的损害。如果美国政府真正关心美国人民的命运的话，它应当接受世界和平理事会的呼吁和苏联提出的建议，立即同意停止核武器试验，进而完全禁止核武器。”
