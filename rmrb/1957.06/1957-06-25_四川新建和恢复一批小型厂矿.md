Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd. Sichuan is currently rebuilding and restoring a batch of small coal kilns, small iron mines, small sulfur mines and other small-scale factories and mining enterprises.

　　Most of these small factories and mines are newly built and restored by handicraft cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, or so-called "brother teams." The industrial and mining leadership departments of the special districts and counties have allocated a sum of funds to support these enterprises; large factories and mines also provide them with some technical guidance.

　　According to statistics from the five special districts of Fuling, Daxian, Wanxian, Jiangjin, and Neijiang, since the beginning of the year, hundreds of small-scale industrial and mining enterprises of various types have been restored, newly built, and expanded. They all have the advantages of spending less money, achieving quick results, and accommodating more labor.

　　It is reported that after all thirty-six small factories and mines planned for construction, restoration, and expansion in Fuling Special District this year are put into production, the output of coal and iron will increase by more than half compared with this year's plan; the output of sulfur may increase by more than two times.

　　In Xuanhan County, Daxian Special District, the thirteen small coal kilns restored in April and May have an annual output of more than 6,500 tons. Together with the output of the original coal kilns, they basically meet the coal needs of urban residents and various industries in the county, and can also supply a portion to the rural areas.

　　Sichuan has scattered resources and widespread mineral deposits, which are favorable conditions for the development of small-scale industrial and mining enterprises. In the past, a one-sided pursuit of large scale led to the closure of some small-scale industrial and mining enterprises.

### 四川新建和恢复一批小型厂矿

　　四川新建和恢复一批小型厂矿
    新华社成都23日电　四川各地正在新建和恢复一批小煤窑、小铁矿、小硫磺矿等小型厂矿企业。
    这些小型厂矿大多是手工业社、农业社或所谓“兄弟班”新建和恢复的。专区和县的工矿领导部门拨出一笔资金，支援这些企业；大的厂矿还给予他们一些技术指导。
    涪陵、达县、万县、江津、内江五专区的统计，自年初以来，恢复、新建、扩建的各类小型工矿达数百处。它们都具有花钱少、收效快、容纳劳动力多的长处。
    据悉，涪陵专区今年计划新建、恢复和扩建的三十六个小型厂矿全部投入生产以后，煤铁的产量都将比今年计划增加一半以上；硫磺的产量可能增加两倍多。
    达县专区宣汉县在四、五两月恢复的十三个小煤窑，年产量六千五百多吨，加上原有煤窑产量，基本上满足了全县城镇居民和各行业的用煤需要，并且还能供应农村一部分。
    四川资源分散、矿藏普遍，是发展小型工矿企业的有利条件。过去片面求大，曾经停闭了一些小型工矿企业。
