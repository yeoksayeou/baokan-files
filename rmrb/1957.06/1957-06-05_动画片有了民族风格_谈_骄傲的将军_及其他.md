    Animated Films Acquire National Style
    —On “The Proud General” and Others
    Tong Heng
    When I and many comrades watched the animated film "The Proud General," we felt great interest from beginning to end. After watching it, for several days, everyone often talked about it and found it very interesting.
    It's not only interesting because its story is educational; more importantly, the story has national characteristics. The characters, plot, entire story structure and development, as well as its simple and sincere tone, all demonstrate that it is a good Chinese folk story created by the playwright. A large part of the reason why this animated film makes the audience feel particularly close and fond of it lies here.
    Similarly, in terms of painting, this animated film also has a national style, whether it is character modeling, depiction of expressions, portrayal of plots, scenery, composition, and color. It can be clearly seen that the designers and painters of the animated film have absorbed many beautiful and beneficial elements from our national and folk traditional arts. For example, the protagonist, the general, from his facial makeup to his clothing, and even his walking, drinking, laughing, and other postures, has absorbed the expressive methods of Peking Opera characters, vividly shaping the image of an ancient Chinese military general. The flattering sycophant, with his white bridge of the nose, is also a villainous character's facial makeup in Peking Opera, which is familiar to the masses. Other scenes, such as the dances of the palace singers and the scenery of lakes, mountains, reeds, and wild geese, all show that the painters consciously drew on folk dance and Chinese painting. At the same time, the whole film adopts cartoonish exaggeration in many places, making the characters more prominent, the personalities more distinct, and some plots more humorous and satirical, thus enhancing the artistic effect. For example, the general's proud appearance and the sycophant's flattering face are expressed vividly, making the audience laugh heartily. This kind of cartoonish exaggeration is indispensable for animated films; and the fact that the painters do not exclude the consistent national style of the whole film while exaggerating the depiction is also a success of the animated film "The Proud General."
    Our new China's animation filmmakers, this effort to pursue a national style, although it is only just beginning and has only just achieved preliminary success, should be given the most attention. Because animated film (formerly known as "cartoon") is itself a foreign art form, the animated films we used to watch were almost all foreign productions. Therefore, our own animated films were not only mostly westernized stories, but also mostly westernized pictures, with few characteristics of national art. However, in recent years, the progress and improvement of our animated films have been rapid and amazing! It has not only changed from the previous crude and rough to the current exquisite and meticulous, not only developed from the past where it could only barely draw black and white films to the present where it can also fully use color, not only progressed from drawing mostly animal short films in the past to now being able to draw longer and more complex character story films, but, more importantly, it has largely broken away from the westernized influence of the past and leaped into a brand-new stage. This is a memorable milestone on the road of the new China's animated film industry.
    Along with "The Proud General," the "Color Animated Puppet Film Exhibition" of 1956, which began on the eve of the "June 1st" International Children's Day, also featured two other animated films besides the four puppet films: "Big Red Flower" and "I Know." Both of these are also color films, and they are also quite successful in creating a national style. The big red flower and yellow oriole in "Big Red Flower" adopt the painting method of flower-and-bird paintings, which is especially novel and lovely. The little rabbit and mother rabbit in "I Know," especially the mother rabbit, can be said to have completely overcome the westernized image and have the kind of kind maternal expression of middle-aged women we often see in our lives; Grandpa Goat is also completely a goat with the demeanor of a Chinese elder, which is very appropriate to the character's status. Although the styling of the yellow wolf is not as good as that of the goat and mother rabbit, the painters tried their best to adopt some folk decorative painting methods, and there is no awkward or forced feeling, which is also valuable.
    In each of the three animated films, the outdoor landscapes all adopt landscape painting methods, which are very beautiful and therefore strengthen the national characteristics of the animated films, which is good. However, the shapes of the peaks and ridges are similar, and there is too little change. After watching too much, one cannot help but feel monotonous. Moreover, this painting method can only be used for long shots. The grass, trees, hillsides, and flowing water in the near distance are not easy to express using landscape painting methods and still use watercolor painting methods. Therefore, the distant and near scenery on the screen are sometimes not harmonious and coordinated enough. In addition, the music accompanying the animated film should also pay attention to the national style, and it should be combined with the development of the plot to express various different moods and atmospheres. However, I am even more of a layman when it comes to music, so it is better to talk less about it.

    动画片有了民族风格
    ——谈“骄傲的将军”及其他
    同衡
    当我和许多同志一起看“骄傲的将军”这部动画片的时候，自始至终感到极大的兴趣，看完之后一连好几天，大家还常常谈起它，觉得很有意思。
    有意思的不仅是因为它的故事富有教育意义；更重要的，还在于这故事富有民族的特色，人物、情节、整个故事的结构和发展，以及它淳朴的情调，都说明它是剧作者创作的一个很好的中国的民间故事。这部动画片让观众感到特别亲切、喜爱的原因，很大部分是在这里。
    同样，这部动画片在绘画方面，不论是人物造型、神态刻划、情节描绘、布景、构图和色彩等等，也都具有民族风格。可以明显地看出，动画片的设计和绘制者，从我们民族的和民间的传统艺术中吸取了许多优美的和有益的东西。例如主角将军，从脸谱到服装，甚至走步、饮酒、言笑等姿态，就是吸取了京剧人物的表现方法，而生动地塑造出中国古代武将的形象来的。那个谄媚的食客，脸上的白鼻梁，也是京剧中反派角色的脸谱，为群众所熟悉。其他如宫庭歌女的舞姿，湖山芦雁等景色，也都可以看得出来绘制者是有意识地在向民间舞蹈和中国画借鉴。同时，全片在许多地方采用了漫画式的夸张手法，使人物形象更突出，性格更鲜明，也使某些情节更幽默和带有讽刺的意味，因而增强了艺术的效果。例如将军那种骄傲的样子，食客那副吹拍的嘴脸，都因此而表现得淋漓尽致，不由得观众不哈哈大笑。这种漫画式的夸张，为动画片所不可或缺；而绘制者在夸张描绘的同时，不排斥全片一贯的民族风格，也是“骄傲的将军”这部动画片的成功之处。
    我们新中国的动画片工作者，这种追求民族风格的努力，虽然还仅仅是开始，还刚刚获得初步的成就，但却最应该引起我们重视。由于动画片（过去所谓“卡通”）本身是一种外来的艺术形式，过去我们所看的动画片，几乎都是外国的出品，因此我们自己摄制的动画片，也不但多半是洋化的故事，而且更多半是洋化的画面，很少有民族艺术的特色。可是近几年来，我们动画片的进步和提高，是迅速和惊人的！它不但从过去的简陋粗糙，变成了现在这样精美细致，不但从过去的只能勉强绘制黑白片，发展为现在这样也能充分使用彩色，不但从过去的多数画些动物短片，进到了现在这样更能画出较长的和复杂的人物故事片，而且，更重要的，是在很大程度上脱出了过去的洋化影响，而跃入了现在这样一个崭新的阶段，这是新中国动画片事业的道路上值得铭记的一段里程。
    和“骄傲的将军”同在“六一”国际儿童节前夕开始举行的1956年出品的“彩色动画木偶片展览”中展出的，除四部木偶片外，还有另外两部动画片“大红花”和“我知道”。这两部也都是彩色片，在民族风格的创造方面，也都相当成功。“大红花”中的大红花和黄莺等，采用了花鸟画的画法，尤其新颖可爱。“我知道”中的小兔和母兔，特别是母兔，可说已经完全克服了洋化的形象，而具有我们生活中习见的那种中年妇女可亲的母性的神情；山羊公公也完全是一只带有中国长者风度的山羊，表现得很合角色的身分。黄狼的造型，虽不如山羊和母兔，但绘制者竭力采用了一些民间装饰的画法，并无生硬勉强之感，这也是可贵的。
    三部动画片，每一部的野外远景，都采用了山水画法，很美，也因此加强了动画片的民族特色，这是好的。可是，峰峦形状大同小异，变化太少，看多了却不免要感到单调。而且，这种画法只能用在远景上，近处的草木、山坡、流水等等，却不易运用山水画法来表现，而仍然用的水彩画法，因此，画面上的远近景物，有时不够和谐协调。此外，动画片所配的音乐，似乎也应该注意民族风格，而且应该结合剧情的发展，表现各种不同的情调和气氛。不过我对音乐更加外行，还是少谈为妙。
