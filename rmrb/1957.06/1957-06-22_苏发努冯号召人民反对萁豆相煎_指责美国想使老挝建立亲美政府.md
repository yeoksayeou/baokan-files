Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st: Vientiane dispatch: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, recently issued a statement in Vientiane, accusing the United States of actively engaging in conspiracies during the current political crisis in Laos, attempting to establish a completely pro-American government in Laos to help the United States realize its policy of resuming war and carrying out colonial exploitation in Laos.

The statement pointed out that the United States and its followers used the vote in the Lao National Assembly, which demanded that the Phouma government change its negotiating methods with the Lao Fighting Units to make the negotiations more successful, to create the current political crisis.

Souphanouvong condemned the United States for instigating countries that follow it to carry out blatant interference in Laos. For example, they bought off some Lao politicians, secretly transported weapons into Laos, armed a group of people, and established some strategic bases; the United States used its pawns to carry out divisive and provocative propaganda among the Lao royal family, people, and Buddhist circles, preventing negotiations between the Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units; the United States instigated its followers to continuously invade the Lao Fighting Units' assembly areas of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, and these attacks have continued until recent weeks; in the other ten provinces under the control of the Royal Government, they instigated their pawns to carry out retaliatory activities of intimidation, arrest, and massacre against former resistance personnel.

The statement said that the United States and its pawns are stepping up pressure on the Royal Government, such as blocking or restricting the import of essential goods, threatening to reduce or stop aid, and threatening to create riots or division, etc.

Souphanouvong called on Lao patriots and the people of the whole country to resolutely oppose the conspiracies of the United States. At present, in particular, it is necessary to oppose the conspiracy of the United States to establish a government that pursues a policy of civil strife.

Souphanouvong said that the Lao Fighting Units have always been loyal to the sacred interests of the motherland and the Lao people, loyal to the interests of peace and national unification, and guarantee their willingness to work together with all the Lao people to strive for the rapid establishment of a government that sincerely hopes for peace and neutrality, and is willing to continue negotiations with the Lao Fighting Units in order to realize the policy of peace and neutrality and the unification of the Kingdom.

The statement concluded by saying that the Lao people demand peace and unity. No force can stop the Kingdom of Laos from achieving peace and unity.

　　苏发努冯号召人民反对萁豆相煎
    指责美国想使老挝建立亲美政府
    新华社河内21日电　万象消息：寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王最近在万象发表声明，指责美国在当前老挝政治危机期间，积极进行阴谋活动，企图使老挝建立一个完全亲美的政府，来帮助美国实现在老挝恢复战争和进行殖民剥削的政策。
    声明指出，美国和它的追随者利用了老挝国民议会为要求富马政府改变同寮国战斗部队的谈判方法以使谈判更快成功而进行的投票，制造了当前的政治危机。
    苏发努冯谴责美国唆使追随它的国家，对老挝进行露骨的干涉活动。例如，他们收买老挝一些政客，偷偷地把武器运入老挝，武装了一批人，成立了一些战略基地；美国利用它的爪牙，在老挝皇族、人民和佛教界中进行分裂和挑拨宣传活动，阻止王国政府和寮国战斗部队的谈判；美国唆使它的追随者，不断侵犯寮国战斗部队集结地桑怒和丰沙里两省，直到最近几个星期，还在进行这种进攻；在王国政府控制下的其他十个省，它们唆使爪牙对前抗战人员进行恐吓、逮捕和惨杀的报复活动。
    声明说，美国和它的爪牙，向王国政府加紧施加压力，例如封锁或限制头等需要物品的进口，威胁着要减少或停止援助，威胁着要制造暴动或分割等等。
    苏发努冯号召老挝爱国人士和全国人民坚决反对美国的阴谋活动。在当前，特别是要反对美国企图成立一个奉行萁豆相煎的政策的政府的阴谋。
    苏发努冯说，寮国战斗部队一贯忠于祖国和老挝人民神圣的利益，忠于和平和国家统一的利益，保证愿意同全体老挝人民一起进行努力，以争取迅速成立一个这样的政府：它诚心希望和平中立，愿意同寮国战斗部队继续谈判以便实现和平中立政策和王国的统一。
    声明最后说，老挝人民要求和平和统一。任何力量都阻止不了老挝王国达到和平和统一。
