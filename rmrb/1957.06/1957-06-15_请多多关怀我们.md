　　Please Give Us More Care
　　Li Keng
　　Comrade Cao Yu once said at a symposium that the publicity work for actors in newspapers and periodicals is currently too little; not long ago, the "People's Daily" published the record of a symposium on film work, in which some people also talked about this issue. As an actor in the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, I have some feelings in this regard.
　　Because the actors of the Beijing Film Actors Troupe rarely participate in filming, the audience is not very familiar with them. However, the actors try their best to participate in other artistic activities to hone themselves and improve themselves. In the past six months, we have performed two major plays – "Sunrise" and "Home." Together with the six short plays such as "Family Affairs" performed last year, we have performed nearly two hundred shows. Although our performance level is not high, some actors still shine in their performing arts: Lin Dongsheng's creation of Cousin Mei, Zhou Ting's portrayal of Cui Xi, Li Tang's portrayal of Hu Si, as well as Li Huan, who played the mother in "Mother and Daughter," and Guan Zongxiang, who played the deaf-mute in "Security Officer," have all been praised by the audience. However, there has never been an article in the Beijing newspapers and periodicals that commented on and introduced our stage performances. No wonder some of our actors say that our troupe is the least noticed and most uncared for artistic group in Beijing.
　　Some of our actors regard recitation performances as a regular artistic activity. Almost every weekend, we go to various schools, government offices, or the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Cultural Center to perform at recitation meetings. This kind of activity has expanded our connection with the masses. Many young friends are unfamiliar with our performances on the screen and stage, but they are quite familiar with our recitations.
　　However, we have never received support and help from public opinion. No article has been published in newspapers and periodicals to introduce and criticize our recitation performances. And how much we need to hear opinions in this regard!
　　We hope that public opinion will pay more attention, care, and help to our various activities.

　　请多多关怀我们
　　黎铿
    曹禺同志在一次座谈会上曾说，目前报刊上对演员的宣传工作做得太少了；不久前，“人民日报”刊载的关于电影工作的座谈会纪录，其中也有人谈到这个问题。作为北京电影演员剧团的一个演员，在这方面我是有些感受的。
    由于北京电影演员剧团的演员们很少参加拍片，观众对他们是不太熟悉的。但是演员们却尽量争取参加其他一些艺术活动，来磨炼自己，提高自己。我们在这半年里，演出了两个大戏——“日出”和“家”。加上去年演出的“家务事”等六个小戏，我们已演出了将近两百场了。我们的演出水平虽不高，可也还有些演员在表演艺术上闪射出光芒：林东升创造的梅表姐、周婷扮演的翠喜、李唐扮演的胡四，以及在“母女俩”中演母亲的李环、“保卫干事”中演聋哑人的管宗祥等都曾得到观众的赞扬。可是北京的报刊上，就没有过一篇文章对我们的舞台演出给予评论和介绍。难怪我们有些演员说，我们剧团在北京是最不被注意、最没人关怀的一个艺术团体了。
    我们有部分演员把朗诵演出作为经常性的艺术活动。几乎每个周末，我们都到各学校、机关，或在中苏友协文化馆举办的朗诵会上演出。这种活动，扩大了我们和群众的联系，许多青年朋友对我们在银幕上、舞台上的表演是陌生的，但却对我们的朗诵挺熟悉。
    可是，我们也从没有得到舆论的支持和帮助，报刊上没有登过一篇文章，对我们的朗诵演出作过介绍和批评。而我们又是多么需要听到这方面的意见啊！
    希望社会舆论对我们的各种活动予以更多的注意、关怀和帮助。
