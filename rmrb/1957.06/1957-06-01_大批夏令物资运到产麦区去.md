    Large Quantities of Summer Supplies Shipped to Wheat-Producing Areas
    As the wheat harvest season approaches, an average of over a thousand tons of summer supplies have been shipped daily from Tianjin to major wheat-producing areas such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Anhui since the second quarter, in order to meet the needs of the rural market.
    Although raw materials such as steel, iron, and cotton yarn are relatively scarce this year, thanks to the various production increase and saving measures adopted by Tianjin's industrial departments and the efforts of the commercial departments, the total value of industrial products supplied by Tianjin to various regions has basically maintained the level of the second quarter of last year. Popular goods needed by the vast rural areas, such as handcart tires, rubber shoes, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, and summer goods such as undershirts, vests, cooling oil, and Rendan, have significantly increased compared to last year. This year's supply of industrial products also includes power steel mills for grinding wheat, which are being supplied to Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces for the first time. These steel mills are driven by diesel engines and are ten times more efficient than stone mills, which are very popular among farmers.
    The prices of the industrial products supplied this year have basically remained at last year's price levels. The student blue cloth, which is very popular among farmers in North China, is still priced at 38 cents per foot. Only a small percentage of the general merchandise, accounting for less than 5% of the total supply, has experienced a slight increase in price due to the shortage of raw materials. ·Xinhua News Agency·

    大批夏令物资运到产麦区去
    麦收季节快到，为了供应农村市场需要，第二季度以来平均每天都有上千吨夏令物资从天津运往河北、山西、山东、河南、陕西、安徽等主要麦产区。
    今年虽然钢、铁、棉纱等原材料比较困难，但是由于天津市工业部门采取了各种增产节约措施和商业部门的努力，天津市供应各地的工业品总值基本上仍保持了去年第二季度的水平。广大农村需要的手推车轮胎、胶鞋、竹壳热水瓶等畅销货和汗衫、背心、清凉油、仁丹等夏令货，还比去年显著增加。今年供应各地的工业品中还有第一次供应河北、山西等省用来磨小麦的动力钢磨。这种钢磨用柴油机带动，效率比石磨大十倍，农民很欢迎。
    今年供应的工业品的价格，基本上保持去年的物价水平。深受华北农民欢迎的学生蓝布，每尺仍是三角八分。只有占供应总值不到5％的小百货，因原材料缺乏，价格略有上涨。　·新华社·
