　　Words of Warning in Prosperous Times
　　Miáo Hǎinán, Vice Governor of Shandong Province and Director of the Shandong Federation of Industry and Commerce

　　The ancients said: In a state governed by virtue, speak frankly and act with integrity. Under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland is marching towards a socialist society. All undertakings of the motherland are developing rapidly, the international status of the motherland is rising to unprecedented heights, and the people of the motherland are enjoying an unprecedented democratic life. All of this symbolizes that the motherland is in a period of unprecedented prosperity, a "state governed by virtue" unparalleled in history.

　　"Speaking frankly" means nothing more than "saying everything one knows, saying it all without reservation," and "speaking directly without concealment." This is precisely the attitude the Party hopes the people of the whole country will adopt in helping the Party with the rectification campaign.

　　"Acting with integrity" means nothing more than "taking the world as one's own responsibility," "rejoicing at being corrected," and "correcting mistakes upon hearing them." This is precisely the socialist broad-mindedness and magnanimity of the Party, which humbly and sincerely accepts the criticisms everyone puts forward.

　　The great Chinese Communist Party is the core leadership of the motherland's undertakings. It is entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the six hundred million people of the motherland, and it shoulders the historical task of building a socialist society in the motherland. In view of its heavy responsibilities and long road ahead, in order to better and faster promote the development of construction, and in order to better consolidate and exert its leading core role in the undertakings of the motherland, it launched this rectification movement.

　　Since the start of the rectification movement and the large-scale "blooming" and "contending," many non-Party members, based on the spirit of "blooming" and "contending," have expressed many valuable opinions and factual criticisms to the Party with the enthusiasm of loving the Communist Party and supporting socialism, thereby fulfilling the responsibility of "candid friends" and "beneficial friends." This is an even more exciting event.

　　However, while being excited, some absurd and outrageous words and deeds that are difficult to tolerate have appeared in the process of "blooming" and "contending." Some people even say, "The masses do not want the Communist Party, the masses want to overthrow the Communist Party, and want to kill the Communist Party." May I ask who are these so-called "masses"? Are they the masses of counter-revolutionary elements? If so, these so-called "masses" are precisely the objects of dictatorship, the objects of suppression, and they have no right to speak in "blooming" and "contending." Everything about them should be handled using the methods for dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Others say: We can manage the affairs of the country well even without the Communist Party; still others say: The Communist Party is even worse than the Kuomintang. We don't believe these words even more. We have vivid memories of the lessons of the past. Not to mention the era of feudal dynasty rule, even taking the period after the Xinhai Revolution as an example, which of the ruling groups of Yuan Shikai, the Northern Warlords, and even Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang did not do things that humiliated the nation and forfeited its sovereignty? At that time, the people lived in dire straits, in deep water and scorching fire.

　　These insane remarks far violate the principles of socialism, attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Party, and also far exceed the scope of "blooming" and "contending." I say that this is not "speaking frankly," but rather dangerous and intolerable poisonous weeds. We solemnly declare: As industrialists and businessmen who are full of confidence and excitement and are transforming into genuine laborers, we resolutely oppose these reactionary remarks that are detrimental to socialism and shake the leadership of the Party.

　　At the symposium of the industrial and commercial sectors convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, many of us industrialists and businessmen poured out our heartfelt words to the Party. This has played a good role in helping the Party eliminate the "three isms" and consolidate the leadership of the Party. But it is undeniable that some non-socialist confused thoughts, and even some serious errors of principle, have also been exposed in the contention. For example, Comrade Zhang Naiqi actually proposed that fixed interest is not exploitation, but replaced it with the argument that seems to cater to people's psychology of "gaining without labor" and that "changing one's bones is easy to associate with pulling tendons and peeling skin, which will cause endless worries for industrialists and businessmen" (the original sentence is not clear). May I ask where does this unearned gain come from? Of course, it is derived from the surplus value of the labor of the working class, not from falling from the sky. The exploited are the working class, and the exploiters are those who "gain without labor." The distinction is clear, and the two parties are clear. Where there is exploitation, there is the exploiting class that bears the exploitation. Since there are classes, there is the inherent duality of this class; although the face of the duality changes with the times. Not acknowledging the negative side of this class itself reflects a serious negative side of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, ideological remolding is still in the process of arduous struggle. These arduous processes of ideological remolding are precisely the process of bourgeois elements shedding the capitalist fetus and changing to socialist bones. In the future, on the basis of improved thinking, "classes will be eliminated, and individuals will be happy." At that time, it will be a pleasant state of transcending the ordinary of capitalism and entering the sanctity of socialism. I don't understand what is the basis for causing "endless worries"?

　　Our national industrialists and businessmen are in the process of transforming into self-reliant laborers. Looking forward, since handing over our enterprises, we have taken a big step forward on the socialist road. But "he who walks a hundred miles is halfway at ninety." The closer we get to victory, the more we need to redouble our efforts to remold our thinking. On the basis of constantly striving for self-remolding, we will finally happily hand over capitalist ideas and complete the final stage. At this critical juncture of taking a step further on the hundred-foot pole, what we yearn for are candid advice and heartfelt genuine help, not those fallacies that take advantage of class emotions, instill rice porridge-like ambiguousness, confuse people's ideological consciousness, and hinder our transformation. The reactionary remarks of people like Ge Peiqi are easily seen through because they are too blatant. Anyone with a little common sense can see his ulterior motives, which are not a major concern. The most terrible thing is the fallacy of those capitalist nostalgics who hide a knife in their smile and wear a socialist cloak. These people with ulterior motives pay lip service to supporting the Party and Marxism-Leninism, but in reality, they are peddling their own private goods and undermining the foundations of the Party. He says with a straight face that he represents the will of the industrialists and businessmen, but in reality, he is dragging us back and pulling us back to the capitalist road. This kind of seemingly caring but actually harmful, seemingly right but actually wrong fallacy may temporarily confuse the vision of some industrialists and businessmen. However, enlightened industrialists and businessmen will eventually be able to distinguish right from wrong and distinguish between enemies and friends. I believe that on the basis of the training in this rectification movement, our industrialists and businessmen will further move closer to the Party, believe in the Party, and happily complete the final stage of transformation, while those foxes that have revealed their tails will surely be spurned by our industrialists and businessmen.

　　盛世危言
　　山东省副省长山东省工商联主任委员  苗海南
    古人云：邦有道危言危行。祖国在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党正确领导下，正在向社会主义社会迈进，祖国的一切事业正在迅速地发展，祖国的国际地位正在空前提高，祖国人民正在享受着空前未有的民主生活。这处处象征着祖国正处在历史上找不到的“邦有道”的鼎盛时期。
    所谓“危言”不外乎是“知无不言，言无不尽”，“直言无隐”。这正是党希望全国人民帮助党整风所持的态度。
    所谓“危行”不外乎是“以天下为己任”，“闻过则喜”“闻过必改”等。这正是党虚怀若谷地诚恳愿意接受大家提出的批评的社会主义胸襟和雅量。
    伟大的中国共产党是领导祖国事业的核心。它受着祖国六亿人民的重托，它肩负着祖国建设社会主义社会的历史重任。它鉴于自己的任重道远，为了更好地更快地推动建设事业的发展，为了更好地使党在祖国事业中巩固和发挥它的领导核心作用，才发动这次整风运动。
    自从整风运动开始，大“放”大“鸣”以来，不少党外人士根据“鸣”“放”精神，以爱护共产党和拥护社会主义的热诚，对党提出了不少的宝贵意见和实事求是的批评，从而尽到了“诤友”“益友”的责任。更是值得令人兴奋的大事。
    但在兴奋同时，在“放”“鸣”中出现了一些令人难以容忍的荒谬绝伦的言行。有的人竟说“群众不要共产党，群众要推翻共产党，要杀共产党。”请问这些所谓“群众”是谁？是不是反革命分子的群众？如是的话，这些所谓“群众”正是专政的对象，是镇压的对象，“鸣”“放”中没有他们的发言权。他们的一切应该用处理敌我矛盾方法来处理。又有人说：没有共产党我们也能把国家事情办好；又有人说：共产党比国民党还坏。这些话我们更不相信。过去的历史教训我们是记忆犹新的。且不论封建王朝统治时代，即以辛亥革命以后的一段历史而论，袁世凯、北洋军阀以至蒋介石的国民党统治集团，谁未干过丧权辱国的事？那时人民生活是水深火热，民不聊生。
    这些丧心病狂的言论远远违背了社会主义原则，企图推翻党的领导，而且也远远超越了“放”“鸣”的范围。我说这不是“危言”，而是危险的要不得的恶毒草。我们郑重地声明：作为一个满怀信心和兴奋地正在转化为名副其实的劳动者的工商业者，我们坚决反对这些不利于社会主义，动摇党的领导的反动言　　论。　
    我们工商业者在这次中共中央统战部所召开的工商界座谈会上，不少的人对党吐出了肺腑之言。这对帮助党消除“三大主义”，对巩固党的领导是起了良好的作用。但无可讳言，在争鸣中也暴露了一些非社会主义的混乱思想，甚至有些是严重的带有原则性的错误的言论。如章乃器同志竟提出定息不是剥削，而代之以看起来似乎是迎合人们心理“不劳而获”和提“脱胎换骨容易连想到抽筋剥皮会引起工商业者无穷的忧虑”（原句记不清）的论调。请问这不劳而获是获自何方？出自何处？当然是获自工人阶级的劳动剩余价值，而不是从天上掉下来的。被剥削者是工人阶级，剥削者是“不劳而获”的人，来去分明，两造清楚。有剥削就有承担剥削的剥削阶级。既有阶级，就有这一阶级所固有的两面性；尽管两面性的面貌随着时代的不同而有所改变。不承认这个阶级消极的一面，其本身就反映着严重的资产阶级的消极一面。因此，思想改造还是正在艰巨斗争过程中。这些艰巨的思想改造过程，正是资产阶级分子脱资本主义的胎、换社会主义之骨的过程。将来在思想提高的基础上，“阶级消灭，个人愉快”。那时正是超资本主义之凡，入社会主义之圣的愉快境地。我不明白有何引起“无穷忧虑”之根据？
    我们民族工商业者正处在转化为自食其力的劳动者的过程中。瞻望前途，自从交出了企业后，我们走社会主义道路，已大大的向前迈进了一步。但“行百里者半九十”，越是接近胜利，我们更需要加倍努力改造思想，在不断努力自我改造的基础上，最后愉快的交出资本主义思想，走完最后一关。在这百尺竿头更进一步的紧要关头，我们所渴望的是逆耳忠言，苦口婆心的真正的帮助，而不是那些利用阶级情感，灌米汤式的似是而非模糊人们思想意识，妨碍我们改造的谬论。葛佩琦之流的反动言论是容易被人识破，因为他说的太露骨，凡是稍有常识的人都可以看出他的别有用心，这不足为大患的。最可怕是笑里藏刀，披着社会主义外衣的资本主义留连者的这种谬论。这些别有用心的人，口口声声说拥护党，拥护马列主义，实际他是在那里贩运私货，挖党的墙根。他一本正经的面孔说是代表工商业者的意志，实际上他是在拖我们的后腿，拉我们回到资本主义的道路。这一种名为关怀，实是危害的似是而非的谬论，可能暂时混淆一部分工商业者的视听，但是，觉悟了的工商业者终能明辨是非分清敌我的。我相信我们工商业者在这次整风运动的锻炼的基础上，进一步靠拢党，相信党，愉快的走完改造的最后一关，而那些露出尾巴的狐狸，必将被我们工商业者所唾弃的。
