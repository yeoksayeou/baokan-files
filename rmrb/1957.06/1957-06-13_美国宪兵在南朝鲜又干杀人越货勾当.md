Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th. According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Seoul "Kyonghyang Shinmun" reported that American military police stationed in South Korea recently shot and seriously injured a Korean youth, Zheng Chengbiao (transliteration), who was about to board a train at the Cheongdo Station in Gyeongsangbuk-do, with a pistol, and another youth was also seriously injured.

When Zheng Chengbiao fell to the ground with five bullets in his body, the American military police robbed him of his belongings and 11,000 hwan in cash.

The U.S. military police authorities stationed in South Korea later openly slandered the Korean youth as a member of a "train robbery gang," attempting to exonerate the criminal American military police.

　　美国宪兵在南朝鲜又干杀人越货勾当
    新华社平壤12日电  据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：据汉城“京乡新闻”报道，驻在南朝鲜的美国宪兵最近又在庆尚北道的清道车站用手枪射击正要搭乘火车的朝鲜青年郑承表（译音），使他和另一个青年受了重伤。
    当郑承表身中五弹倒在地上的时候，这个美国宪兵抢走了他所带的东西和一万一千圜现金。
    驻在南朝鲜的美国宪兵当局事后竟公然诬蔑这个朝鲜青年是“火车盗窃集团”的成员，企图为犯罪的美国宪兵开脱罪名。
