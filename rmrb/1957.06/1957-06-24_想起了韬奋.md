　　Remembering Taofen
　　Ren Hui
　　Seeing the headline "Noteworthy Trends in the China Democratic League" in the newspaper, I was suddenly reminded of Taofen again. Whenever I encounter major political events, I always naturally think of him. On the tenth anniversary of his death, I wrote in a short article:
　　"These ten years have been earth-shaking, and the world situation and history have undergone tremendous changes. The history of these ten years has been written by the Chinese people with blood, sweat, and tears. I think those of us who worked with Taofen can most easily appreciate and imagine his heartfelt love, excitement, and pain during every important historical turning point. On the day the Japanese fascists surrendered unconditionally, I wandered through the bustling streets of Chongqing and suddenly thought of him; in 1946, when Chiang Kai-shek tore up the truce agreement and launched a large-scale civil war, and the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party decided to fly back to Yan'an, I came out of Meiyuan New Village in Nanjing and suddenly thought of him; in 1949, when the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held, and I saw the list of CPPCC representatives, I suddenly thought of him again."
　　Today, I think of him again. How wonderful it would be if he were here! Because he will always be the most genuine and reliable friend of the Chinese people, and he will always be the irreconcilable enemy of all reactionaries, careerists, and deserters in the revolutionary ranks.
　　Like us, Taofen was an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background who had received a bourgeois education. During the great storm of the First Great Revolution, he was still a reformist filled with naive fantasies. When he took over "Life Weekly" in 1926, his political program was still "revitalizing industry" and "striving for political integrity." That is to say, at that time, he had not yet solved the problem of whom to rely on to save China. If he were still alive, he would be sixty-three years old this year. Compared with people of his generation, he cannot be said to have been an advanced element. However, due to his honesty, selflessness, striving to be close to the masses, and never forgiving himself, he was gradually tempered by the mass anti-Japanese movement and accepted the ideological influence of the Chinese Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism. After visiting capitalist Europe and socialist Soviet Union in 1935, he changed. His thinking changed, his position changed, and his feelings changed. He never shied away from this major transformation, and he never shied away from the process of fighting his own thoughts. In Hong Kong in 1941, he talked to me more than once about his "experience" of transforming from a bourgeois democrat to a communist, and about the inner pain and joy he felt when he made up his mind to break with his background, education, and old thoughts and feelings. Taofen was an intellectual from the old society, but among the intellectuals of the same era, I rarely saw anyone as pure, innocent, and selfless as him. Taofen was selfless. He cared about the motherland, the people, and the fate of progressive mankind all over the world, but he never cared about himself. For himself, he was an "absent-minded" person. He didn't know the way, he couldn't manage money, he couldn't take care of himself, and even taking a few coins for transportation required his wife to prepare for him. Where was his heart? In the current situation, in the people.
　　Because he was selfless, he could work wholeheartedly for the people; because he was selfless, he could break with his past happily and fight his past; because he was selfless, he could be consistent in word and deed and not be preoccupied with personal gains and losses. Let us compare Taofen's quality with that of his "ally" who kept saying "Heaven punishes those who are not for themselves." One is a sincere servant of the people, and the other is a hypocritical personal careerist. Thinking of this, although it is not worth "weeping bitterly" as Chen Renbing said, I cannot help but "sigh deeply."
　　Another characteristic of Taofen is honesty, that is, a down-to-earth attitude of studying and conducting oneself. If he didn't understand, he tried to understand; if he didn't comprehend, he tried to comprehend. Once he understood and comprehended, he would go to practice and implement it selflessly and tirelessly. This point is particularly evident in his understanding and relationship with Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Communist Party. "Another key issue in the ideological development of intellectuals in the old China era was the attitude towards the working people and the working-class party—the Communist Party. Should they rely on the workers and peasants and believe in the leadership of the Communist Party? Or should they despise and fear the workers and peasants and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party? Those who have the first kind of thought will feel that they have strength, wisdom, reliance, and a future, and dare to thoroughly oppose imperialism and feudalism, and may gradually transform their thinking and gradually combine with the workers and peasants. Those who have the second kind of thought, if they do not correct it, will inevitably believe in and rely on imperialism and embark on a completely reactionary road" (note). Taofen was a person with the first kind of thought. After realizing this truth, he firmly embarked on the road of thoroughly opposing imperialism and feudalism, resolutely believing in the leadership of the Communist Party, and determined to transform himself and gradually combine with the workers and peasants. Those who stubbornly disbelieved in the leadership of the Communist Party and were unwilling to rely on the workers and peasants finally exposed their true colors today, after hiding them for many years, in such a major historical period.
　　In the great era of storms and tempests for more than half a century, Chinese intellectuals have been walking an extremely difficult path. Taofen was a person who found the right path and took the right path. He is a person who is always worth learning from for the victorious progress and revolutionary path of Chinese intellectuals. However, not to mention those double-dealers and ambitious elements with ulterior motives, even among the intellectuals who do not oppose or even support socialism today, the question of "who to rely on" and the question of "who to follow" do not seem to have been well resolved. Therefore, when feeling "confused" in the face of major political events, recalling Taofen and reading his "experience" should be beneficial.
　　It's late at night. Looking at the headline "Noteworthy Trends in the China Democratic League," I thought of Taofen. How wonderful it would be if Taofen were here.
　　Remembering Taofen, my heart aches.

　　想起了韬奋
　　任晦
    在报上看到“可注意的民盟动向”这个标题，我又猛然地想起了韬奋。在遇到重大政治事件的时候，我总会很自然地想起他，在他逝世十周年的那天，我曾在一篇短文中写过：
    “这十年是天翻地复的十年，这十年世界形势和历史发生了巨大的变化。这十年的历史，是中国人民用血、汗和眼泪来写成的。我想，我们这些和韬奋共过事的人，是最容易体会和想像到他在每一个重要的历史转折时期的、发自衷心的喜爱、兴奋、和苦痛的。在日本法西斯无条件投降的那一天，我在沸腾的重庆市区漫步，忽然想起了他；1946年蒋介石撕毁停战协定，大举发动内战，中共代表团决定飞回延安的那一天，我从南京的梅园新村出来，蓦然想起了他；1949年第一次人民政协开会，当我看到政协代表名单的时候，我又忽然想起了他。”
    今天，我又想起他了，要是他在，多好啊！因为，他永远是中国人民的最真实、最可靠的朋友，他永远是一切反动分子、野心家、革命队伍中的逃兵降将们的不调和的敌人。
    和我们一样，韬奋是一个小资产阶级出身的、受过资产阶级教育的知识分子，在第一次大革命的大风暴中，他还是一个充满了天真幻想的改良主义者，1926年接办“生活周刊”，他提出的政治纲领也还是“振兴实业”，和“力求政治的清明”，就是说，在那个时候，他还没有解决要救中国，必须依靠什么人的问题。假如他还在，今年也已经是六十三岁的人了，和他同年辈的人们比较起来，他不能说是一个先进分子，可是，由于他的诚实、无私、力求接近群众、从不宽恕自己，他就逐渐地从群众抗日运动中受到锻炼，接受了中国共产党和马克思列宁主义的思想影响。1935年他游历了资本主义的欧洲和社会主义的苏联之后，他变了，思想变了，立场变了，感情变了，他从不讳言这个重大的转变，他从不讳言这个和自己的思想作斗争的过程。1941年在香港，他不止一次和我谈过他自己从一个资产阶级民主主义者转变为一个共产主义者的“经历”，谈过当他下定决心和自己的出身、教养、旧的思想感情诀别时的、出自内心的痛苦和欢乐。韬奋是一个从旧社会来的知识分子，可是在同时代的知识分子中，我很少看到过像他那样的纯洁、天真与无我。韬奋是无我的。他关心祖国，关心人民，关心全世界进步人类的命运，可是他从不关心自己。对于自己，他是一个“心不在焉”的人，他不认识路，他不会管钱，不会照顾自己，甚至出门一次要带几个车钱也要他夫人给他准备。他的心在哪里？在时局、在人民。
    无我，他才能全心全意地为人民工作，无我，他才能痛痛快快地和自己的过去诀别，和自己的过去斗争，他才能心口如一地不斤斤计较于个人的得失。让我们拿韬奋的这种品质来和他的那位口口声声说
  “人不为己，天诛地灭”的“盟友”对比一下吧，一个是真诚的人民的勤务员，一个是伪善的个人野心家，想到这里，虽则值不得如陈仁炳所说的“痛哭流涕”，我还是禁不住“长太息”了。
    韬奋的另一个特点是诚实，就是老老实实的治学和为人的态度。不懂，力求其懂，不通，力求其通，一旦懂了、通了，就奋不顾身、不辞艰险地去实践，去贯彻，这一点，特别显著地表现在他对马克思列宁主义和对中国共产党的认识和关系上。“旧中国时代，知识分子思想发展上另一个关键问题，是对于工农劳苦群众以及对工人阶级政党——共产党的态度问题。是依靠工农群众并相信共产党的领导呢？还是鄙视和害怕工农群众并反对共产党的领导呢？有第一种思想的人，就会觉得自己有力量，有智慧，有依靠，有前途，敢于彻底反对帝国主义和封建主义，并且可能逐步改造自己的思想，逐步达到和工农群众相结合。有第二种思想的人，如果不改正，必然会相信和依靠帝国主义，走上完全反动的道路”（注）。韬奋是具有第一种思想的人，他认识了这个道理之后，坚定地走上了彻底反对帝国主义、封建主义，坚决相信共产党的领导，决心改造自己、逐步达到和工农群众相结合的道路，而那些顽强地不相信共产党领导、不愿意依靠工农群众的人，却终于在隐藏了本来面目多少年之后，在今天这样一个重大的历史时期暴露出他们的本来面目来了。
    在半个多世纪的风狂雨暴的大时代中，中国知识分子走着的是一条极其艰险的道路。韬奋，是找到了路，走对了路的人，是中国知识分子胜利地走向进步、走向革命道路的一个永远值得我们学习的人。但是，且不讲那些两面三刀、心怀贰志的野心分子，就是在今天已经不反对、乃至拥护社会主义的知识分子中，对于“依靠谁”的问题，对于跟着什么人走的问题，也似乎还没有得到很好的解决，那么，在重大的政治事件前面感到“糊涂”的时候，回想一下韬奋，读一读他的“经历”，应该是会有益处的。
    夜深了，望着“可注意的民盟动向”这个标题，我想起了韬奋。要是韬奋在，多好啊。
    想起了韬奋，我心疼。
