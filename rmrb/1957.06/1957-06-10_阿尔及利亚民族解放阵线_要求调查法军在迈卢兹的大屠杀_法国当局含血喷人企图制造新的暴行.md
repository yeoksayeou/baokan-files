Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 9th - The spokesman for the Algerian National Liberation Front in Cairo said on the 8th that the Algerian National Liberation Front demands the establishment of an international commission of inquiry composed of representatives of neutral countries to investigate the massacre in Melouza, Algeria, by the French army and other atrocities. In the Melouza massacre, more than three hundred Algerian Muslim men, women, and children were killed in two hours.
　　
The spokesman said that the Algerian National Liberation Front will raise the Algerian question again at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the United Nations General Assembly to make a decision recognizing the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the Algerian people.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 9th - News: In recent days, the French ruling group has been attempting to use the so-called "Melouza" incident as a pretext to brew up new massacres in Algeria.
　　
Melouza is a village in the Greater Kabylia region. According to reports, on May 30th, a large group of people of unknown origin killed hundreds of peaceful residents here, allegedly because they "cooperated with the French authorities." All reactionary newspapers in France have made a great noise about this, describing this large-scale killing as an "act of revenge" by Algerian insurgents against "Muslims who sided with France." They immediately blamed this crime on the Algerian National Liberation Front, which is leading the Algerian people in their national liberation struggle against French colonialism.
　　
French President Coty and the Foreign Ministry spokesman also delivered radio speeches and statements on May 31st, using this as a pretext to defend French colonial rule and colonial suppression in Algeria, and to issue threats to the Algerian national liberation movement.
　　
On June 6th, Robert Lacoste, the French Resident Minister in Algeria, convened a meeting of General Salan, commander of the French Army stationed in Algeria, other military leaders, and representatives of local civil authorities. According to "Le Monde," it was decided at this meeting to take "comprehensive overall action" to deal with those participating in the Algerian national liberation movement.
　　
The Algerian National Liberation Front already requested United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on June 2nd to investigate the killing of many residents in Melouza village within the framework of the United Nations. Larbi Bouhali, secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, wrote a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General on the 7th supporting the request of the Algerian National Liberation Front.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线
    要求调查法军在迈卢兹的大屠杀
    法国当局含血喷人企图制造新的暴行
    新华社开罗9日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线在开罗的发言人8日说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线要求成立一个由中立国家的代表组织的国际调查委员会去调查法国军队在阿尔及利亚迈卢兹的大屠杀和其他暴行。在迈卢兹大屠杀中，有三百多个阿尔及利亚穆斯林男女和儿童在两小时内被杀害。
    发言人说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线将在联合国大会下届会议上再次提出阿尔及利亚问题，要求联合国大会作出决定，承认阿尔及利亚人的自决权利和主权。
    据新华社9日讯　巴黎消息：这几天来，法国统治集团正企图借口所谓“迈卢兹”事件，酝酿在阿尔及利亚进行新的屠杀。
    迈卢兹是大卡比利亚山区的一个村庄。据报道，5月30日，一大批来历不明的人在这里打死了几百个和平居民，据说是因为他们同“法国政权合作”。法国所有反动报纸都就这件事大吵大嚷起来，把这种大规模的凶杀说成是阿尔及利亚的起义者对“站在法国方面的回教徒”的“复仇行为”。他们立即把这个罪行加在领导阿尔及利亚人民进行民族解放斗争反对法国殖民主义的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的身上。
    法国总统戈蒂和外交部发言人在5月31日也分别发表广播演说和声明，借此为法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治和殖民镇压辩解，并且对阿尔及利亚民族解放运动者发出威胁。
    6月6日，法国驻阿尔及利亚驻节部长罗伯·拉戈斯特召集了驻阿尔及利亚的法国陆军司令萨兰将军及其他军事领导人员和当地民政当局的代表开会。据“世界报”报道，在这个会议上决定采取“全盘的总体行动”来对付参加阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的人士。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经在6月2日要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在联合国范围内调查迈卢兹村打死许多居民的情况。阿尔及利亚共产党书记拉比·布哈利7日写信给联合国秘书长支持了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的要求。
