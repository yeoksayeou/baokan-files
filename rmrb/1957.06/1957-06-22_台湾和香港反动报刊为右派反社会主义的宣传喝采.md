　　Taiwan and Hong Kong Reactionary Newspapers Cheer for Rightists' Anti-Socialist Propaganda

　　These newspapers said that Luo Longji's opinions were completely the same as the broadcasts of Taiwan's "Voice of Justice" radio station; praised Chu Anping as "conscientious and passionate," and "indeed skillful"; said that the existence of people like Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi on the mainland was a "gratifying phenomenon"; and praised Fei Xiaotong's article as "extremely brilliant."

　　When the just calls of the people across the country against the reactionary remarks of the rightists resounded throughout the country, the reactionary newspapers and news agencies in Taiwan and Hong Kong raised a chorus of cheers for the rightists. This fact clearly shows whose interests the rightists' fallacies serve.

　　When the Kuomintang Central News Agency and Dadao News Agency broadcast Luo Longji's anti-Party remarks at a forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on May 22, they said that Luo Longji's request to establish a self-contained institution was completely the same as the appeal of Taiwan's Voice of Justice radio station. What kind of appeal did this radio station make? It turned out to be calling on "pro-Communist parties and non-party人士" to take advantage of the CPC's rectification campaign to "seek redress and revenge for those who were 'wrongfully rectified' and 'wrongfully struggled against' in the 'Three-Anti,' 'Five-Anti,' and 'Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries' movements." Therefore, the Central News Agency said that some "China Democratic League" members, led by Luo Longji, had responded to the call of the Chiang gang's radio station.

　　The Chiang gang's newspapers and news agencies were particularly interested in Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi. The Hong Kong Shanghai Daily News published Chu Anping's and Ge Peiqi's fallacies on the front page on June 7 and 12 respectively, and in the editor's note, praised Chu Anping as "indeed skillful" and believed that Ge Peiqi's "opinions deserve applause." The New Life Evening News felt that the Hong Kong newspapers had published too little of Chu Anping's speech, and on June 11, it published the full text of Chu Anping's speech on the front page. It also added an editor's note, saying that this article was "the most prominent" in the criticism of the CPC, and "what is published here is the original text without any changes." In order to increase the value of this fallacy, this reactionary newspaper also published a statement on the left side of the newspaper title, circling several eye-catching characters with a red border: "Please pay attention to today's special article in this newspaper, Chu Anping bombs Mao Zedong."

　　The Hong Kong pro-American so-called "Third Force" Zhong Sheng Evening News specially published an editorial on June 12, encouraging Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi to attack the Party, and happily said that the existence of "people like Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi" on the mainland was a "gratifying phenomenon." This is precisely the spirit of obeying the truth that "wealth cannot corrupt, poverty cannot move, and power cannot subdue." Dadao News Agency even believed that Ge Peiqi "represents the voice of 500 million people."

　　The Hong Kong "True News," run by the pro-American forces "Third Force" and supported by the United States Information Service, serialized an article entitled "Salute to Chu Anping from Afar" on the 9th and 10th of this month. The author, signed Si Ren, whose real name is Xue Huizhi, once held military and political positions in the Kuomintang, was a traitor during the Anti-Japanese War, and is now a "Third Force" figure supported by the United States, receiving subsidies from the United States Information Service, and participated in the planning of the Kowloon Incident last October. He said that Chu Anping is still a conscientious and passionate writer, and his speech indeed has the courage to "lightly stroke the tiger's whiskers." "You are right to dare to speak, 'iron shoulders bear righteousness, and spicy hands write articles,' which is the manifestation of the Chinese intellectuals' due sense of justice, and millions of exiles overseas are willing to support you!" He also believes that Chu Anping's speech "revealed the dissatisfaction and resistance of the mainland intellectuals towards the CPC, which is indeed a starting point not to be ignored." He encouraged Chu Anping and others to "no longer be kowtowing worms and echoers, and should stand up and rely on their own efforts." The Central News Agency couldn't help but shout "This is a starting point that cannot be ignored." And said, "Observers hereby specifically cite the Hungarian people's anti-communist and anti-Russian revolutionary event in October last year as an example."

　　The Hong Kong Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau newspaper "Observatory," on June 8, published a special article entitled "Chu Anping, the editor-in-chief of the Beiping Guangming Daily, bombs Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai," and also praised Chu Anping, saying that the Guangming Daily he presided over has become a "forum" for right-wing intellectuals to vent their "depression" and insult the Communist Party.

　　The Taiwan "Overseas" monthly magazine published on May 20 an article written by Li Weinan entitled "The Miserable and Tragic Mainland Intellectuals," saying that Fei Xiaotong's "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" "describes the predicament of senior intellectuals who are trying to survive, accommodating and tolerating, and is also extremely brilliant." "We forgive him and sympathize with the unfortunate encounters of ordinary intellectuals on the mainland. Their predicament of accommodating and tolerating today is not only not from their hearts, but also contains infinite anger, just as Sima Qian said: 'A fierce tiger in the deep mountains makes all beasts tremble, but when it is in a cage, it wags its tail and begs for food, because of the gradual constraint of its accumulated power.' Once the mainland is restored, intellectuals with the spirit of fierce tigers will be rescued from the red cage, and I believe they will make great contributions to clearing the red poison of mainland youth and reviving the Republic of China."

　　In addition to praising the "heroic" behavior of right-wing elements such as Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi, the Chiang gang's newspapers and news agencies also vilified and distorted the criticism of right-wing remarks by the people across the country. The Hong Kong reactionary "Global News" published two special articles by Dadao News Agency and Central News Agency on June 12. The Dadao News Agency's special article slandered Lu Yuwen as a "shameless clown." The Central News Agency called the criticism of right-wing elements by the people across the country a "siege movement." The "Zhong Sheng Evening News" also published an editorial on June 11 entitled "The End of Blooming and Contending," calling the just voice of the people across the country in maintaining socialism and maintaining the leadership of the Communist Party a "siege of the blooming and contending." This editorial finally desperately encouraged the right-wing elements to say: "Seek another path of freedom and democracy. There will be no real freedom of speech until totalitarianism and dictatorship are overthrown!"

　　The reactionary newspapers and news agencies in Taiwan and Hong Kong said that Chu Anping is an "iron shoulder bearing righteousness" and Lu Yuwen is a "shameless clown"; Zhang Bojun said that Chu Anping and Hu Feng are "true historical figures" and Lu Yuwen is a "clown." This is really "great minds think alike"! If the right-wing elements do not want to be wrong to the end, after seeing whose support their remarks are receiving, can they still not bow their heads to the people and thoroughly repent?

    台湾和香港反动报刊为右派反社会主义的宣传喝采
    这些报刊说罗隆基的意见，与台湾“正义之声”电台的广播完全相同；称赞储安平“有良心，有热血”，“的确有一手”；说在大陆有储安平、葛佩琦这一班人，是“可喜的现象”；夸奖费孝通写的文章“至为精采”。
    当全国人民反对右派分子反动言论的正义呼声响彻全国的时候，台湾、香港的反动报纸、通讯社对右派分子却扬起一片喝采声。这个事实，清楚地说明了右派的谬论适合于什么人的利益。
    国民党中联社、大道社播发罗隆基5月22日在中共中央统战部所召开的座谈会上的反党言论时，说罗隆基建议成立一个自成体统的机构的要求，与台湾正义之声广播电台的呼吁完全相同。这个电台提出了什么样的呼吁呢？原来是呼吁“附共党派及无党派人士”，借中共整风的机会“替曾在‘三反’、‘五反’、及‘镇反’运动中被‘整错’‘斗错’的人申冤报仇”。因此，中联社说，以罗隆基为首的一部分“民盟”人士，已经响应蒋帮电台的呼吁了。
    蒋帮报纸和通讯社对储安平、葛佩琦尤其感到兴趣。香港上海日报6月7日和12日分别在第一版以头条地位刊登了储安平和葛佩琦的谬论，并且在编者按语中，称赞储安平“的确有一手”，认为葛佩琦的“意见值得鼓掌”。新生晚报嫌香港报纸把储安平的发言登得太少，6月11日它在第一版刊出储安平发言的全文。它还加上编者按语，说在对中共的批评中，这一篇是“最突出的”，“这里刊出的是一字不改的原文”。为了增加这篇谬论的声价，这家反动报纸还在报头的左边刊登了一个声明，用红色花边圈着几个醒目的大字：“请注意本报今日特稿，储安平炮轰毛泽东”。
    香港亲美的所谓“第三种势力”的中声晚报在6月12日特地发表了社论，鼓励储安平、葛佩琦向党进攻，并且高兴地说，在大陆“有储安平、葛佩琦这一班人，这是可喜的现象”。这正是“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的服从真理的精神。大道通讯社甚至认为葛佩琦是“代表了五亿人民的呼声。”
    美国新闻处支持的亲美力量“第三势力”办的香港“真报”，于本月9日、10日连载一篇题为“遥向储安平致意”的文章。作者署名斯人，真名叫薛慧之，曾任国民党军政职务，抗战时当过汉奸，现在是美国支持下的“第三势力”人物，拿美国新闻处津贴，去年10月曾参与九龙事件的策划。他说储安平不失有良心有热血的一个操觚者，他的发言，确乎有“轻捋虎须”的勇气。“你敢言是对的，‘铁肩担道义，辣手著文章’，才是发挥了中国知识分子应有的正义感，海外千万的流亡人士都愿支持你！”他还认为从储安平的发言中“透露了大陆知识分子内心对中共的不满和反抗情绪，实在是一个不忽视的起点”。他鼓励储安平们“不再做磕头虫应声虫，该挺起脊梁自力更生。”中央社也情不自禁地喊出“这是一个不可忽视的起点。”并且说“观察家于此特别以去年10月匈牙利人民反共抗俄的革命事件为例。”
    香港的国民党中统报纸“天文台”报，6月8日以“北平光明日报的总编辑储安平炮轰毛泽东周恩来”为题的特稿，对储安平也备加赞扬，说他主持的光明日报已成为右派知识分子倾吐“苦闷”和辱骂共产党的“讲坛”。
    5月20日出版的台湾“海外”月刊刊载了一篇李蔚南写的题为“凄凄惨惨戚戚的大陆知识分子”的文章，说费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”，“描写高级知识分子为了活命，苟合取容的窘态，也至为精采。”“我们原谅他，更同情大陆一般知识分子的不幸遭遇。他们今天苟合取容的窘态，岂但非出自本心，而且还蕴藏着无限愤怒，正如太史公所说的：‘猛虎在深山，百兽震恐，及在槛阱之中，摇尾而求食，积威约之渐也’，一旦大陆重光，有猛虎般精神的知识分子，从赤色槛阱中解救出来，相信他们对清除大陆青年的赤毒，和复兴中华民国，必然有极伟大的贡献。”
    蒋帮报刊、通讯社除了赞扬储安平、葛佩琦等右派分子的“英雄”行为以外，并对全国人民对右派言论的批评加以污蔑和歪曲。香港反动的“环球报”6月12日刊载了大道社和中央社的两篇特稿。大道社特稿诬蔑卢郁文是“无耻的小丑”。中央社把全国人民对右派分子的批评叫做“围剿运动”。“中声晚报”也于6月11日发表了一篇题为“鸣放的收场”的社论，把全国人民维护社会主义，维护共产党的领导权的正义声音，叫做“对于鸣放的围剿”。这篇社论最后绝望地鼓励右派分子说：“另寻自由民主的途径吧。非到极权与独裁被摧倒，就没有真正的言论自由！”
    台湾和香港的反动报刊和通讯社说储安平是“铁肩担道义”，卢郁文是“无耻的小丑”；章伯钧说储安平、胡风是“真正的历史人物”，卢郁文是“小丑”，这真是“英雄所见略同”啊！右派分子如果不愿意错到底，在看到他们的言论正在受到什么人的支持以后，他们还能不向人民低头，彻底悔改吗？
