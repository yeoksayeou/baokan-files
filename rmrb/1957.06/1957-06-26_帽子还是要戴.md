A Little Collection of Harsh Criticisms

    Hats Must Still Be Worn
    Zhiyuan

    Once rectification begins, once anti-dogmatism begins, hats seem to become the “target of public criticism” and like “rats crossing the street, everyone yells ‘kill them!’” In fact, hats themselves are not bad. As long as they are not “randomly put on” or “forced on,” but rather carefully chosen for size, thickness, and suitability, then it can be stated definitively that hats must still be worn.

    Today, some people, using the pretext of helping the Party with rectification, are “fully releasing” their poisonous gas, “loudly chirping” their crow-like tunes, and clamoring with counter-Party, anti-people’s democratic dictatorship, and anti-socialist fallacies. If we say that these are reactionary thoughts, that they are conducting class struggle on the political front, and that they are right-wing ambitious elements, can these hats be considered “randomly put on” or “forced on” for them? Aren’t they “just the right size, fitting perfectly”?

    帽子还是要戴
    致远
    一整风，一反教条主义，帽子，似乎就成了“众矢之的”和“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的东西。其实，帽子本身并不坏。只要不是“乱戴”、“硬戴”，而是经过了大、小、厚、薄的选择，肯定说，帽子还是要戴的。
    今天有些人，借口帮助党整风，“大放”其毒气，“大鸣”其乌鸦之调，大肆叫嚣反党、反人民民主专政、反社会主义的谬论。如果说他们这是反动思想，说他们是在进行政治战线上的阶级斗争，称他们为右派野心分子，这样的帽子，对他们来说，能算是“乱戴”、“硬戴”吗？岂不是“不大不小，戴上正好”吗？
