Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 12th: The World Peace Council continued its plenary session in Colombo on the morning and afternoon of June 11th. The speeches of the representatives of various countries mostly focused on the issue of banning atomic and nuclear weapons.

　　World Peace Council member, British Mrs. Felton, read a congratulatory message from former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, at the morning meeting. The congratulatory message said: "We need to end wars, we need to reject armaments, and we need to see goodwill expressed among all nations.

　　"We want to see atomic and nuclear weapons completely banned, so that no country continues to manufacture them. We do not want any experimental explosions."

　　This meeting of the World Peace Council is different from previous sessions in that it does not have a fixed agenda, and representatives can discuss any issues they consider important.

　　The first speaker in the morning was Dutch representative Van Dobben. He said that the movement against atomic weapons in the Netherlands is developing rapidly. He said that the committee established in May to demand a ban on nuclear weapons has requested the Dutch government to issue a statement in favor of banning such weapons. One hundred prominent Dutch scientists have already announced that they demand a ban on nuclear weapons explosions.

　　The well-known Indian Congress Party member and follower of Gandhi, Kalelkar, talked about why he had previously refused to attend peace conferences, saying, "Because I believed that simply holding meetings and discussing peace issues is ineffective, due to the unwavering policies and overwhelming power of the major powers." But he said, "Now I am beginning to believe that, by the grace of God, the weak and helpless are uniting to produce an invincible new force."

　　Kalelkar strongly condemned racial discrimination and the notion of white supremacy.

　　Han Xueye, head of the North Korean delegation, said that American officials and the South Korean authorities have recently openly clamored to transport the latest weapons, including atomic weapons, into South Korea. He said that South Korean troops also plan to establish American missile bases in South Korea.

　　In his speech, Han Xueye exposed the conspiracy of the American aggressor group to create another war in Korea.

　　Han Xueye said, referring to the issue of the United States placing missiles in the Okinawa Islands and Taiwan, "This action by the United States is part of a strategic policy to tense the situation in the Far East and complicate unresolved issues."

　　Han Xueye supported the Soviet Union's position on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing and demanded that the United States and the British government accept the Soviet proposal.

　　Japanese Professor Yoshitaro Hirano introduced the situation of Japan's struggle for peace and against atomic bomb testing in his speech. He then put forward five suggestions to the meeting: This meeting requests the four major powers to hold talks and reach an agreement on stopping all nuclear tests; support the statements of German and American scientists against atomic weapons; mobilize parliamentary politicians to pass resolutions against testing such bombs; this meeting requests the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations; the peace movement should do everything possible to organize various forms of international joint action.

　　Cypriot representative Potamitis appealed at the meeting, demanding that all peace forces be mobilized to help Cyprus achieve independence. He said that the only reason the Cypriot people cannot obtain self-determination "is that the British government hopes to use Cyprus for military purposes."

　　Representatives from West Africa, the United States, Britain, Pakistan, Brazil, and Spain also spoke at the morning meeting.

　　At the afternoon meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Korneichuk, said that the Soviet Union has always been willing to negotiate with the United States and Britain to reach an agreement on banning the use and testing of atomic and nuclear weapons and reducing armaments. His remarks were met with prolonged applause.

　　He said that unfortunately, the United States and Britain have rejected these proposals. He said that the Soviet Union had suggested that, before signing an agreement to completely stop testing, testing should be stopped at least for a certain period. But even this suggestion was rejected.

　　Korneichuk exposed some deceptive and dangerous statements by Western countries. They believe that consolidating peace depends on increasing the number of atomic and nuclear weapons and atomic bombs, and increasing the number of rockets and supersonic air forces. This rhetoric is meant to paralyze the people and weaken their fighting spirit.

　　Korneichuk also suggested that major powers should compete in unconditionally helping underdeveloped countries develop their economies.

　　At the afternoon meeting, Guo Moruo's speech was warmly welcomed. In addition, representatives from Peru, Bulgaria, West Germany, and other countries also spoke in the afternoon.

　　世界和平理事会第二天会议
　　各国代表要求禁止核武器
    新华社科伦坡12日电  世界和平理事会6月11日上午和下午继续在科伦坡举行全体会议，各国代表的发言大都集中在禁止原子核武器问题上。
    世界和平理事会理事，英国的费尔顿夫人在上午会议上宣读了前印度总督拉贾戈柏拉查里的贺电。贺电说：“我们需要终止战争，我们需要拒斥军备，我们需要看到所有各国间表现出善意。
    “我们希望看到原子核武器完全受到禁止，使没有一个国家继续制造它们。我们不要任何试验性爆炸”。
    世界和平理事会的这次会议同以前各次不同，它没有制订固定的议程，代表们可以讨论任何他们认为是重要的问题。
    上午第一个发言的是荷兰代表范多班。他说，荷兰反对原子武器的运动在迅速发展。他说，5月间成立的要求禁止核武器委员会已经要求荷兰政府发表拥护禁止这种武器的声明。有一百位著名的荷兰科学家已经宣布他们要求禁止核武器爆炸。
    著名的印度国大党议员、甘地信徒卡勒尔卡谈到他以前为什么拒绝参加和平会议，他说，“因为我认为，由于大国有确定不移的政策和压倒一切的力量，仅仅举行会议和讨论和平问题是不起作用的”。但是他说，“现在我开始认为，蒙上帝的恩，软弱无助的人正在联合起来产生不可战胜的新力量。”
    卡勒尔卡严词指责种族歧视和白种人优越的论调。
    朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野说，美国官员和南朝鲜当局最近公开叫嚣要把包括原子武器在内的最新武器运入南朝鲜。他说，南朝鲜军队还计划在南朝鲜建立美国导弹基地。
    韩雪野在发言中揭露美国侵略集团在朝鲜制造另一次战争的阴谋。
    韩雪野在谈到美国在冲绳群岛和台湾安置导弹的问题时说，“美国的这种行动是使远东局势紧张、使悬而未决的问题更加复杂的战略方针的一部分。
    韩雪野支持苏联在停止核武器试验问题上的立场，并且要求美国和英国政府接受苏联建议。
    日本平野义太郎教授在发言中介绍了日本争取和平、反对原子弹试验的斗争的情况。接着他向会议提出了五项建议：这次会议要求四大国举行会谈，就停止一切核试验达成协议；支持德国和美国科学家们反对原子武器的声明；动员议会政治家通过反对试验这种炸弹的决议；这次会议要求恢复中国在联合国组织的席位；和平运动要尽一切力量组织各种形式的国际联合行动。
    塞浦路斯代表波塔米提斯在会上呼吁，要求动员所有和平力量来帮助塞浦路斯获得独立。他说，塞浦路斯人民得不到自决权的唯一原因“是英国政府希望把塞浦路斯用于军事方面”。
    在上午会议上发言的还有西非、美国、英国、巴基斯坦、巴西和西班牙的代表。
    在下午的会议上，苏联代表团团长考涅楚克说，苏联始终愿意同美国和英国进行谈判，就禁止使用和试验原子核武器和裁减军备达成协议。他的这番话引起了经久不息的鼓掌声。
    他说，不幸的是，美国和英国拒绝了这些建议。他说，苏联曾经建议，在签订完全停止试验的协议以前，至少在一定期限内停止试验。但是连这个建议也遭到拒绝。
    考涅楚克揭露了西方国家一些骗人的危险的说法。它们认为巩固和平要靠增加原子核武器和原子弹的数目，增加火箭、超音速空军的数目。这种论调是要麻痹人民，削弱人民的斗志。
    考涅楚克还建议大国在不附条件地帮助不发达国家发展它们的经济方面展开竞赛。
    下午的会议上，郭沫若的发言受到热烈欢迎。此外，下午发言的还有秘鲁、保加利亚、西德等国的代表。
