Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 20th. The leader of the Australian Labor Party delegation visiting China, Risley Helen, who arrived here on the 19th, told reporters that the Australian Labor Party advocates: no restrictions on trade with China; recognition of the People's Republic of China and its participation in the United Nations.

The Labor Party parliamentary executive committee member explained that because the Labor Party is still in opposition in Australia, these views cannot yet be said to represent the country.

Mr. Helen said that it is estimated that the Australian government will consider relaxing the embargo on China, because there is great pressure from public opinion. He estimated that it is possible for Australia to follow Britain in relaxing its trade policy towards China.

The Australian Labor Party delegation, consisting of four people, was invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to visit China. Yesterday afternoon, they were accompanied from Shenzhen to Guangzhou by Lin Song, Secretary of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

The delegation leader, who was a journalist for 25 years and is now the chairman of the Australian Writers' Association, believes that the Chinese Art Troupe's performance in Australia was a great success. He said that in order to strengthen friendship between the two countries, the Australian Labor Party will invite representatives of the Chinese National People's Congress to visit Australia.

When the reporter finally asked him to respond to the Australian people's views on Britain's repeated testing of hydrogen bombs despite the opposition of people from all countries, he said that the Australian Labor Party opposes the testing of nuclear weapons by any country anywhere, because it poses a threat to the world.

　　澳工党议员访华团在广州发表谈话
    主张打破禁运承认中国
    据新华社广州20日电　19日下午到达这里的澳大利亚工党议员访华团团长里斯利·海伦对记者说，澳大利亚工党主张：不要限制对中国的贸易；要承认中华人民共和国并使之参加联合国。
    这位工党议会党团执行委员解释说，因为目前工党在澳大利亚还是反对党，所以这些意见还不能说是代表国家的。
    海伦先生说，估计目前澳大利亚政府将考虑放宽对中国的禁运，因为社会舆论的压力很大。他估计澳大利亚追随英国放宽对华贸易政策是可能的。
    澳大利亚工党议员访华团一行四人，是应中国人民外交学会邀请前来我国访问的。昨天下午由外交学会秘书林松自深圳陪同到广州。
    这位曾作过二十五年新闻记者、现在是澳大利亚作家协会主席的团长，认为中国艺术团在澳大利亚的演出获得了很大成功。他说，为了加强两国间的友谊，澳大利亚工党将邀请中国人民代表大会代表访问澳大利亚。
    当记者最后请他答复关于澳大利亚人民对英国最近不顾各国人民反对，仍一再试验氢弹的意见时，他说，澳大利亚工党是反对在任何地方由任何国家试验核子武器的，因为它给世界带来威胁。
