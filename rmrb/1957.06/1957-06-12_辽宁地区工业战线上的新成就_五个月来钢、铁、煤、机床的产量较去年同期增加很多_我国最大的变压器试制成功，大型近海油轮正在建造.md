This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, June 11th. From January to May this year, the total output value and the vast majority of major products of 130 key enterprises in the Liaoning area under the central ministries have overfulfilled the state plan. The achievements of the heroic working class on the production front are a powerful answer to those who have recently made absurd anti-socialist arguments and attempted to negate the great achievements of our country's construction.

In the past five months, the total output value plan of state-owned industries has been completed by 104.2%; 13 out of 15 major products have overfulfilled the plan. Comparing January to May this year with the same period last year, coal production increased by 544,000 tons; pig iron production increased by 370,000 tons; steel production increased by 452,000 tons; and metal cutting machine tool production increased by 972 units.

The total output value of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the past five months increased by 31.8% compared with the same period last year. The increased production of steel was more than 19,000 tons, iron was more than 22,000 tons, and steel materials were nearly 40,000 tons, requiring 2,100 train cars to transport these iron and steel. The workers of the "Youth Friendship Furnace" in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel produced 5,500 tons of steel more in May than in April. In May, they created the highest record for monthly production of large open-hearth furnaces in the country.

The coal mine workers of Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin, and Beipiao overproduced 299,000 tons of coal in these five months compared to the state plan. The Wang Hengcheng Youth Coal Mining Team of Benxi Coal Mine will be able to complete the coal mining quota for 1959 by the end of August this year. This coal mining team will increase coal production for the country by 7,000 tons this year.

This year's industrial production was carried out under conditions of considerable raw material shortages. In order to ensure increased pig iron production this year, Anshan Iron and Steel used 700,000 tons of sulfuric acid slag from Nanjing and Dalian Chemical Plants to replace iron ore, which can produce more than 300,000 tons of iron. As a result of improved design and improved technology, according to statistics from 18 factories in the Shenyang area, a total of 1,835,500 yuan was saved for the country from January to May. Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory improved the design of oil-poor circuit breakers according to China's specific conditions, which can save 90 tons of steel annually for this one item alone. The Heavy Machinery Plant improved a process route for manufacturing sluice gates, which can save the country 250,000 yuan a year. The Shenyang Weighing Instrument Factory uses one kilogram of coke to smelt 21 kilograms of iron; while in some other factories with the same production conditions, the average amount of iron smelted per kilogram of coke does not exceed 10 kilograms. The promotion of the advanced experience of the Weighing Instrument Factory may enable the factories under the Shenyang First Industrial Bureau to save approximately 2,000 tons of coke throughout the year. Although the lack of raw materials has brought many difficulties to industrial production, these difficulties are being resolved and overcome one by one.

In order to produce more heavy machinery, precision machinery, and special new machinery to equip our country's factories and mines, workers and engineering technicians in Liaoning Province have also made encouraging achievements in the trial production of new products in the past five months. In Shenyang alone, 15 machinery and electrical factories will trial-produce more than 260 new products this year. A giant transformer with a capacity of 40,500 kilovolt-amperes has been successfully trial-produced at the Shenyang Transformer Factory. This is currently the largest transformer made in China, with a total weight of 152 tons. The electricity transformed by this transformer can supply lighting electricity for six cities as large as Shenyang. The BM-35 high-voltage circuit breaker recently produced at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory has a current capacity of 400 MVA. The breaking curve taken by the oscilloscope proves that it fully meets the design standards. A bridge crane weighing 140 tons (plus a 30-ton auxiliary hook) has been manufactured by the Dalian Crane Factory. This giant crane is like a large bridge, and a hook on the machine body weighs more than 11 tons. Its large hook can lift a train; the small crane can also lift ten or so machine tools at a time. At the Dalian Shipyard, a coastal oil tanker with an oil capacity of 4,500 tons and a displacement of 7,100 tons is under construction. Since we have never built such a long ship before, people have had to extend the No. 1 shipyard by another 12 meters.

Let those who make fallacies look at the excellent work of our working class. Although some people are cursing or mocking socialism, the great cause of socialism and the great cause of industrialization will surely be victorious in our motherland.

### 辽宁地区工业战线上的新成就  五个月来钢、铁、煤、机床的产量较去年同期增加很多　我国最大的变压器试制成功，大型近海油轮正在建造

　　辽宁地区工业战线上的新成就
　　五个月来钢、铁、煤、机床的产量较去年同期增加很多
　　我国最大的变压器试制成功，大型近海油轮正在建造
    本报沈阳11日电  从今年1月到5月，中央各部在辽宁地区的一百三十个主要企业的总产值和绝大部分主要产品，都超额完成了国家计划。英勇的工人阶级在生产战线上所获得的成就，对于那些最近大发反对社会主义谬论、企图否定我国建设的巨大成就的人，是一个有力的回答。
    五个月来，国营工业的总产值计划完成了104.2％；十五种主要产品有十三种超额完成了计划。拿今年1月至5月和去年同时期作比较，煤多生产了五十四万四千吨；生铁多生产了三十七万吨；钢材多生产了四十五万二千吨；金属切削机床多生产了九百七十二台。
    鞍山钢铁公司五个月的总产值比去年同期增长了31.8％，增产的钢一万九千多吨、铁两万二千多吨、钢材近四万吨，运输这些钢铁需要用二千一百节火车皮。鞍钢第一炼钢厂“青年友谊炉”的工人们，5月份比4月份多生产了五千五百吨钢。他们在5月份创造了全国大型平炉月产量的最高纪录。
    抚顺、本溪、阜新、北票的煤矿职工，在这五个月内比国家计划增产了二十九万九千吨煤炭。本溪煤矿王恒成青年采煤组，到今年8月底，就可以完成1959年的采煤定额。这个采煤组今年要给国家增产七千吨煤炭。
    今年的工业生产是在原材料相当缺乏的情况下进行的。鞍钢为了保证今年增产生铁，利用了南京和大连化学厂的七十万吨硫酸渣代替铁矿石，可炼铁三十多万吨。由于改进设计、改进工艺的结果，据沈阳地区十八个工厂的统计，从1月到5月共为国家节约了一百八十三万五千元。沈阳高压开关厂按照我国具体情况，改进了贫油断路器的设计，仅这一项全年就可节约钢材九十吨。重型机器厂改进了一种制造闸门的工艺路线，一年可为国家节约二十五万元。沈阳市衡器厂用一公斤焦炭化二十一公斤铁；而在另外一些有同样生产条件的工厂，一公斤焦炭的化铁量平均不超过十公斤。衡器厂的先进经验的推广，使沈阳第一工业局所属的工厂全年可能节约焦炭约二千吨。缺乏原材料虽然给工业生产带来了很多困难，但这些困难正在逐一解决和克服。
    为了生产更多的重型机器、精密机器和专用的新型机器装备我国的工厂和矿山，辽宁省的工人和工程技术人员在试制新产品的工作中，五个月来也取得了令人振奋的成就。仅沈阳市十五家机械和电机工厂，今年就要试制二百六十多种新产品。一台四万零五百千伏安容量的巨型变压器已经在沈阳变压器厂试制成功。这是我国目前自制的最大的变压器，它的总重量是一百五十二吨。这台变压器变出来的电量，可供给六个像沈阳这样大的城市的照明用电。最近在沈阳高压开关厂生产的BM—35型高压断路器，它的电流容量达四百兆伏安，通过示波仪拍摄的断路曲线证明，它完全达到了设计标准。一台一百四十吨重（外加三十吨小钩）的桥式起重机，已由大连起重机厂制造出来。这台巨型的起重机像一座大桥，机体上的一个吊钩就重十一吨多。它的大吊钩能吊起一台火车来；小吊车一次也能吊起十来台机床。在大连造船厂，一艘装油四千五百吨、排水七千一百吨的近海油轮正在开始建造，由于我们从来没有造过这样长的大船，人们不得不将第一造船台再伸延十二公尺。
    让那些大发谬论的人看看我们工人阶级的出色的劳动吧，尽管有人在咒骂或嘲讽社会主义，但是，社会主义的伟大事业、工业化的伟大事业，在我们的祖国是一定要胜利的。
