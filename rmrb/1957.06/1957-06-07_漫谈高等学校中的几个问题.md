Random Thoughts on Several Issues in Institutions of Higher Learning
Beijing University Professor Wang Li

　　There are many current problems in institutions of higher learning. I
  want to talk about three issues: (1) the ideological remolding of intellectuals; (2) the relationship between the Party and the masses; and (3) the leadership of the Party committee and the governance of the university by professors.

　　(1) The Ideological Remolding of Intellectuals

　　At the beginning of the rectification movement in some units, the leadership instructed that certain issues should be emphasized in the discussion during the movement. One of these issues was ideological remolding. Some people said that this was to intimidate the masses, making them afraid to "speak out." In my opinion, it is possible that the leadership did not explain it clearly, leading to misunderstanding. In fact, since it is a Party rectification, the issue of ideological remolding should be a Party issue; Party members who have committed the errors of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism should examine the root causes in their thinking, solve the problem ideologically, so as to avoid repeating the "three evils." As for whether non-Party members need to undergo ideological remolding and how to carry out ideological remolding, that is another issue.

　　However, this other issue cannot be avoided; because if intellectuals need to be remolded, they must rely on the leadership and help of the Party, so it cannot be said to be unrelated to the rectification movement.

　　Do intellectuals need to remold their thinking? If this question were raised a year ago, everyone would agree, that is, they definitely need to be remolded. Today, under the Party's call for "letting a hundred flowers bloom," this understanding has gradually become blurred. The Warring States period was a typical era of a hundred schools of thought contending; Zhuangzi noticed that "that is one right and wrong, this is also one right and wrong," and Zhuangzi's conclusion was: "The manifestation of right and wrong is the reason why the Dao is deficient." This is a denial that there is true right and wrong in the world. Today's hundred schools of thought contending can be compared with the Warring States period. There are many theories that are "well-founded and reasonable," making it difficult for the general public to know what to follow. Even with Marxism, it is easy to give people the feeling of "Is the sky truly blue?" Under these circumstances, some people even doubt whether there is true right and wrong in the world, thereby doubting whether there is still a need for ideological remolding today.

　　On the surface, the contention of a hundred schools of thought and ideological remolding seem to be contradictory. We must deal with this issue dialectically. The contention is for the sake of pursuing truth and distinguishing right from wrong, not for the sake of obliterating truth and blurring the boundaries of right and wrong. If today, because of the contention of a hundred schools of thought, we cannot say which kind of thought is progressive or correct, or which kind of thought is reactionary or wrong, then we can no longer talk about ideological remolding. Of course, reactionary ideas should be distinguished from counter-revolutionary acts, and reactionary ideas within the people should be treated as contradictions among the people; but reactionary ideas should ultimately be criticized. Correctly handling the contradiction between the contention of a hundred schools of thought and ideological remolding, I think this is the key to the issue of ideological remolding of intellectuals.

　　It must be affirmed: all ideas that violate socialism are wrong ideas. Marxism can be developed; however, the strict distinction between development and revision itself is a matter of right and wrong. Affirming that there is true right and wrong in the world, the ideological remolding of intellectuals becomes necessary.

　　However, I personally believe that the ideological remolding of intellectuals should no longer be carried out as a movement in the future. The ideological remolding movement in 1952 did play a certain role, but it also had many side effects. In some schools, senior intellectuals were treated in a fairly crude manner. At that time, being carried out as a movement, it was less for the sake of remolding ideology than for the sake of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. In consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, the ideological remolding movement of 1952 was a success, because the distinction between the enemy and ourselves was clearly drawn. However, the situation is different today: today the main contradiction in the country is no longer the antagonistic contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, but the contradiction among the people, so there is no need to follow the old methods of 1952. I even suspect whether it was appropriate to "eliminate" reactionary remarks together with counter-revolutionaries in the 1955 anti-counterrevolutionary movement. Doing two things of different natures at the same time can easily lead to deviations. If counter-revolutionary acts and reactionary ideas should be distinguished, then "eliminating" reactionary remarks together is confusing the antagonistic contradiction between the enemy and ourselves with the contradiction among the people. In today's process of "speaking out" and "letting go," there are more reactionary remarks than in 1955. Will there be another "elimination" in the future? I don't think it is necessary.

　　As everyone knows, ideological remolding is a long-term process. Now that the Party is using a gentle and mild approach to rectify itself, rather than "ruthless struggle," the ideological remolding of non-Party members should be even more gradual, with no impatience allowed. Especially today, when the Party is calling on us to march towards science and to catch up with or approach the advanced world scientific level in a short period of time, we must allow everyone to live a peaceful life. Zhuge Liang said: "Without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals." In today's terms, "tranquility" means having fewer movements in institutions of higher learning, and "achieving far-reaching goals" means catching up with or approaching the advanced world scientific level.

　　I think we can let intellectuals transform their thinking through scientific practice and political experience. Of course, theoretical study is also important. However, if we say that the thinking of intellectuals today has generally made significant progress, this is primarily because the country's construction has achieved brilliant results; in the face of ironclad facts, we cannot but acknowledge the greatness of the Party. Over time, everyone will get closer to the Party and learn from Party members. Now non-Party members often have the opportunity to work with Party members, and when they see that Party members can analyze problems comprehensively and deeply (of course, there are exceptions), they are unconsciously influenced by dialectical materialism. We should not underestimate this kind of subtle influence; it is an effect that political teachers cannot achieve by lecturing tirelessly.

　　Political study is necessary, but the characteristics of intellectuals should be taken into account. Some cadres are accustomed to doing political education work in rural areas, and they apply the old methods of telling and exhorting farmers repeatedly to intellectuals. In fact, among senior intellectuals, there are many Yan Huis who understand one thing when they hear it, and even more Zi Gongs who understand two things when they hear one. Why not make the reports more concise? I think: the time for theoretical study can be increased, and the time for policy study can be reduced, especially for documents, they should be printed out for everyone to see, without the need for more major reports. It should be pointed out that the political reports and many policy-related reports in Beijing are very brilliant, but sometimes the trade union organizes studies, talks about experiences, and talks about inspirations, which is already considered superfluous. As for other regions, the situation of wasting time and losing jobs can be imagined. I think the time for political study can be streamlined. Cherishing the time of intellectuals is beneficial to the Party and the country.

　　(2) The Relationship Between the Party and the Masses

　　Everyone has talked a lot about the relationship between the Party and the masses, and I am afraid I have no new ideas. At the symposium held by the Party Committee of Peking University, a Party member made a self-criticism. He said that in the past he thought that the language of Party members and non-Party members was different, and it was not easy to unite. Finally, he criticized himself for not starting from the desire for unity, but did not criticize his "different language theory." I think the four words "different language" are of great research value, because coming from the mouth of a Party member, it reflects the view of some Party members towards non-Party members that "they are not of our race, their hearts must be different."

　　We often say that we have a common language with the people of fraternal countries, and even say that we have a common language with all peace-loving people in the world, but they do not speak Chinese. Now, members of the Chinese Communist Party and non-Party members live in the same country, and most of them speak Chinese, but, alas! We do not have a common language between us!

　　If it can be said that we have no common language with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, that is understandable; now it is said that there is still no common language within the people, that is too strange!

　　The language of Party jargon is indeed not good at by the general public, even completely unable to speak, completely unable to understand. However, what the people do not like to hear is precisely this kind of language. We can completely understand what Chairman Mao said, Chairman Mao and we have a common language.

　　Perhaps this Party member said that the so-called different language refers to different thoughts. If that is really the meaning, the problem is even more serious. It is true that there are various types of thoughts, but the type of thought and whether or not one joins the Party are not necessarily related. We cannot say that yesterday you did not join the Party, and your thought belonged to type A; today you joined the Party, and your thought has become type B. The idea of "different language" is a source of alienation between the Party and the masses; if there is a wall between the Party and the masses, it is part of the foundation of this wall.

　　Here I don't want to talk about sectarianism, I just want to talk about the issue of understanding the relationship between the Party and the masses. I personally feel that there should not be a wall between the Party and the masses, but there should still be a line. Otherwise, there would be no distinction between Party members and non-Party members. The retention of this line does not hinder the unity between the Party and the masses, the question is how to understand this line.

　　According to my own superficial understanding, the Party is a political group, it has its Party Constitution, Party members undertake the obligations stipulated by the Party Constitution, and enjoy the rights stipulated by the Party Constitution, which non-Party members cannot interfere with. Apart from that, I don't see any necessary difference between Party members and non-Party members. Therefore, the current distance between Party members and non-Party members is completely artificial and can be changed. We also know that the relationship between the Party and the masses can only be gradually improved, and we cannot hope that there will be no contradictions between the Party and the masses, and this contradiction will continue until the party itself is eliminated. However, it should be pointed out that the current relationship between the Party and the masses is still unhealthy and abnormal. If one is unwilling to admit that Party members and non-Party members can have a common language, this contradiction cannot only not be reconciled, but will also be expanded.

　　(3) The Leadership of the Party Committee and the Governance of the University by Professors

　　I think this issue is very simple: in institutions of higher learning, the relationship between the Party committee and the president is equal to the relationship between the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the relationship between the Party committee and the school affairs committee is equal to the relationship between the Party Central Committee and the National People's Congress.

　　It must be affirmed that the Party can lead science. Only the Party with its far-sightedness knows the most clearly the needs of socialist science. If it is said that only the Party Central Committee can lead, and the Party committees in institutions of higher learning cannot lead, that is also untenable, because the Party committees are precisely under the leadership of the higher-level Party. No one has ever advocated that the Party committees interfere with the equipment of books and instruments, or interfere with the content and methods of teaching; if there are such things, that is naturally wrong. However, if the Party, according to the scientific needs of socialism, makes some suggestions to the school administration in principle, just as the Party Central Committee submits the draft five-year plan to the National People's Congress, that should be reasonable.

　　What many people currently oppose is not the leadership of the Party committee, but the substitution of the Party for the government. The separation of Party and government is not good in any case. In order to remedy this shortcoming, I think the authority of the school affairs committee should be expanded. But I do not agree with "professors governing the university."

　　What does the slogan "professors governing the university" mean? In my opinion, "professors governing the university" is put forward as the opposite of "Party committee governing the university." At the same time, professors governing the university also means that lecturers and teaching assistants cannot govern the university, and even the president cannot make decisions on major issues.

　　We know that the Party committee does not exclude professors; on the contrary, in the future, as more and more professors join the Party, there will be more and more professors in the Party committee. In the future, it can no longer be said that those who lead science do not understand science. When we want to change a system, we should look further ahead, at least ten or eight years, and not just look at our toes.

　　Many institutions of higher learning have now established school affairs committees, and in the future, democracy should be fully promoted so that the school affairs committees can play their due role. At the same time, representative lecturers and teaching assistants should be appropriately absorbed to participate. Eating too much salt does not necessarily mean that experience is richer; white hair does not necessarily mean that one is more intelligent and can consider problems more comprehensively and deeply than young people. Especially in this transitional period, letting the old and new generations sit at the same conference table, letting the existing contradictions between the old and new be exposed, and seeking solutions together, is much better than letting the elderly and young people form an opposing situation of being in power and being out of power. The so-called "professors governing the university," as the name suggests, does not have this advantage.

　　The system of presidential responsibility is superior and must be adhered to. From this point alone, the slogan "professors governing the university" is also inappropriate. Let me explain here: if the president is also a Party member, he handles school affairs as the president, not as a Party member (or Party committee secretary), just as Premier Zhou handles state affairs as the Premier of the State Council. Opposing the Party committee substituting the Party for the government should be opposing the Party committee making decisions on school administration, not opposing the president himself making decisions on school administration. If one opposes the system of presidential responsibility because of opposing "the Party committee substituting the Party for the government," that is wrong.

　　The gentlemen who put forward "professors governing the university" like to cite the example of the professors' association of Tsinghua University before liberation. I was a professor at Tsinghua University for twelve years, and I know clearly that Tsinghua's professors' association precisely did not have the participation of lecturers and teaching assistants (full-time lecturers before the War of Resistance participated, because Tsinghua's "full-time lecturers" were equivalent to associate professors); the council produced by the professors' association was like the responsible cabinet of a capitalist country, and the president of Tsinghua at that time was almost equal to the Queen of England today.

　　"Professors governing the university" is just an empty and beautiful term, and it is actually unworkable. Suppose a university has more than a hundred professors, and suppose they are all willing to sacrifice part of their scientific research time, how can more than a hundred people sit together and discuss many specific administrative matters? Tsinghua established the council in those years to remedy this shortcoming. However, the problem arose from this: the council elected by the professors gradually became detached from the masses and became an oligarchy. What the professors' association discussed was often only the annual list of student graduates, and they often argued for a long time about whether students who failed physical education should graduate; as for all major policies and important measures, they were completely in the hands of the council, and the professors were not convenient to intervene. This kind of bourgeois "democracy," I don't think there is anything to emulate.

　　The superiority of the socialist system should be affirmed first. If a system is not perfect, we should, under the guidance of Marxist ideology, demand that it be made more perfect, and we should not blindly miss the past and let everyone regress for one or two decades.

    漫谈高等学校中的几个问题
    北京大学教授　王力
      高等学校当前的问题很多，我
  想谈的是三个问题：（一）知识分子改造问题；（二）党群关系问题；（三）党委领导和教授治校问题。
    （一）知识分子改造问题
    在某些单位的整风运动开始的时候，领导上交代，在运动中应该着重讨论某些问题。其中一个问题是思想改造问题。有人就说这是对群众恫吓，使群众不敢“鸣”。依我看来，这可能是领导上交代得不清楚，以致引起误解。实际上，既然是党内整风，思想改造问题应该是党内的问题；党员们犯了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的错误，应该归结到思想的根源去检查一番，从思想上解决问题，以免重犯“三害”。至于党外人士要不要进行思想改造和怎样进行思想改造，那是另一问题。
    但是，这另一问题也不能不讨论；因为如果知识分子需要改造的话，就不能不依靠党的领导和帮助，因而就不能说是和整风运动无关。
    知识分子要不要改造思想？这个问题如果在一年前提出，大家的认识是一致的，就是肯定需要改造。在今天党号召“百家争鸣”的情况下，这种认识渐渐模糊了。战国是一个百家争鸣的典型时代，庄子注意到“彼亦一是非，此亦一是非”，而庄子的结论是：“是非之彰也，道之所以亏也”。这是否认天下有真是非。今天的百家争鸣，可以与战国时代媲美，“持之有故，言之成理”的理论颇多，令一般人不知所从。即以马克思主义而论，也容易令人产生“天之苍苍，其正色耶”的感想。在这种情况下，甚至有人怀疑世界上还有真是非，从而怀疑甚至今天还有改造思想的必要。
    从表面上看来，百家争鸣和思想改造似乎是有矛盾的。我们必须辩证地处理这个问题。争鸣是为了追求真理，明辨是非，不是为了抹杀真理，泯灭是非的界限。假使今天由于百家争鸣，就不能说哪一种思想是进步的或正确的，哪一种思想是反动的或错误的，那就不能再谈思想改造。固然，反动思想应该和反革命行为区别开来，人民内部的反动思想应该作为人民内部的矛盾来处理；但是反动思想到底是应该批判的。正确地处理百家争鸣和思想改造之间的矛盾，我认为这是知识分子思想改造问题的关键。
    必须肯定：一切违反社会主义的思想都是错误思想。马克思主义是可以发展的；但是，发展和修正的严格区分，本身就是一个是非问题。肯定了天下有真是非，知识分子的思想改造就成为必要了。
    不过，我个人认为：今后知识分子的思想改造工作，不能再作为一种运动来搞。1952年的思想改造运动，固然起了一定的作用，但同时也起了不少的副作用。在某些学校里曾经用相当粗暴的方式来对待高级知识分子。当时作为一种运动来搞，与其说是为了改造思想，不如说是为了巩固人民民主专政。在巩固人民民主专政这一点上，1952年的思想改造运动是有成绩的，因为敌我的界线划清楚了。但是，今天的情况不同了：今天国内的主要矛盾已经不是敌我的对抗性矛盾，而是人民内部的矛盾，就用不着沿袭1952年的老办法。我甚至怀疑1955年的肃反运动连反动言论都“肃”在一起是不是妥当。两种不同性质的事情同时做去，容易做出偏差来。如果反革命行为和反动思想应该区别开来的话，把反动言论“肃”在一起就是把敌我对抗矛盾和人民内部矛盾混为一谈了。在今天“鸣”“放”的过程中，反动言论比1955年更多了，将来要不要再“肃”一次呢？我看是不必要的。
    大家知道，思想改造是长期性的。今天党内既然采用和风细雨的办法来整风，而不是“无情的斗争”；对党外人士的思想改造更应该让它细水长流，一点急躁不得。特别是今天党号召我们向科学进军，要在不长的时间内赶上或接近世界科学先进水平，就不能不让大家过一种宁静的生活。诸葛亮说过：“非宁静无以致远”。在今天说来，“宁静”就是在高等学校里少搞一些运动，“致远”就是赶上或接近世界科学先进水平。
    我想可以让知识分子从科学实践和政治感受中改造他们的思想。当然，理论学习也是重要的。但是，如果说今天知识分子的思想一般都有了显著的进步，这首先是由于祖国的建设事业有了辉煌的成就；在铁一般的事实面前，不能不承认党的伟大。久而久之，大家更加靠拢党，向党员们学习。现在非党人士常常有和党员共事的机会，看见党员们分析问题能够全面深入（当然也有例外），无形中也就受了辩证唯物主义的熏陶。我们不要低估了这种潜移默化的力量；这是政治课教员唇焦舌敝所达不到的效果。
    政治学习是必要的，但是应该照顾到知识分子的特点。某些干部做惯了农村的政治教育工作，就把对农民那种耳提面命、反复叮咛的老办法用到知识分子的头上来。实际上，在高级知识分子当中，不乏闻一知十的颜回，更多闻一知二的子贡，报告何妨精简一点呢？我想：理论学习的时间可以多些，政策学习的时间可以少些，特别是有文件的就应该把文件印出来给大家看，不必再做大报告。应该指出：在北京的政治报告和许多有关政策的报告都是很精彩的，但是有时候工会组织学习，讲体会，谈启发，已经令人觉得是多余的了。至于其他地区，废时失业的情况可想而知。我认为政治学习的时间是可以精简一些的。珍惜知识分子的时间，于党于国都是有利的。
    （二）党群关系问题
      关于党群关系问题，大家谈得很多了，我恐怕没有什么新的意见。在北京大学党委会召开的座谈会上，有一位党员同志作了自我批评。他说从前他认为党员和非党人士的语言不同，要团结很不容易。最后他批评了他不从团结的愿望出发，而没有批评他的“语言不同论”。我觉得“语言不同”这四个字很有研究的价值，因为出自党员之口，就反映了一部分党员对党外人士怀抱着“非我族类，其心必异”的看法。
    我们常说，我们和兄弟国家的人民有共同语言，甚至说我们和全世界爱好和平的人民都有共同语言，其实他们讲的并不是汉话。现在呢，中国共产党党员和非党人士同在一个国土上住着，而且大部分都讲汉话，然而，唉！我们之间却没有共同的语言！
    如果说我们和蒋介石集团之间没有共同语言，犹有可说；现在说人民内部还没有共同语言，那未免太奇怪了！
    党八股的语言，的确是一般人所不擅长的，甚至完全不会说，完全听不懂。但是，人民所不爱听的也正是这种语言。毛主席的话我们完全听得懂，毛主席和我们有共同的语言。
    也许这位党员说，所谓语言不同是指思想不同。如果真的是这个意思，问题就更严重了。思想有各种不同的类型，这是不错的，但是思想的类型和入党与否并没有必然的关系。我们不能说，昨天你没有入党，思想属于甲型；今天你入了党，思想就变了乙型了。“语言不同”的想法是党群隔阂的一种根源；如果说党群之间有一道墙，它就是这一道墙的一部分基础。
    这里我不想谈什么宗派主义，我只想谈一谈关于党群关系的认识问题。我个人觉得：党群之间不应该有一道墙，但是还应该有一条线。否则党员和非党人士就没有分别了。这一条线的保留，并不妨害党群的团结，问题在于如何了解这一条线。
    据我个人粗浅的了解，党是一个政治集团，它有它的党章，党员们承担党章所规定的义务，享受党章所规定的权利，这是非党人士所不能干预的。除此之外，我看不出党员和非党人士之间有什么必然的分别。因此，目前党员和非党人士之间的远距离完全是人为的，是可以改变的。我们也知道，党群关系只能逐渐改善，不能希望党群之间完全没有矛盾，而且这种矛盾还会继续下去，直到政党本身消灭为止。但是，应该指出，目前的党群关系还是不健康的，不正常的。如果不肯承认党员和非党人士能有共同语言，这种矛盾不但不能调和，而且还会扩大的。
    （三）党委领导和教授治校问题
    我看这个问题很简单：在高等学校内，党委会和校长的关系等于党中央和国务院的关系，党委会和校务委员会的关系等于党中央和全国人民代表大会的关系。
    必须肯定党能领导科学。社会主义的科学需要，唯有高瞻远瞩的党知道得最清楚。如果说只有党中央能领导，高等学校里的党委会不能领导，那也是说不通的，因为党委会正是受上级党的领导的。从来没有人主张过党委干涉到图书仪器的设备，干涉到教学内容和教学方法；如果有那样的情事，那自然是错误的。但是，如果党根据社会主义的科学需要，从原则上向学校行政方面提出若干建议，像党中央向全国人民代表大会提出五年计划草案一样，那应该是合理的。
    目前许多人所反对的不是党委会的领导，而是以党代政。党政不分无论如何是不好的。为了补救这个缺点，我认为应该扩大校务委员会的职权。但是我不赞成“教授治校”。
    “教授治校”这一个口号的提出，意味着什么呢？依我看来，“教授治校”是作为“党委治校”的对立物而提出的，同时，教授治校还意味着讲师、助教不能治校，甚至校长也不能对重大问题作出决定。
    我们知道，党委会中并不排除教授；相反地，将来教授入党的人多了，党委会中的教授也就逐渐多起来了。将来再也不能说领导科学的人不懂科学了。我们要变更一种制度，应该把眼光看远一点，至少要看十年八年，不能单看着脚指头走路。
    现在许多高等学校已经成立了校务委员会，今后应该充分发扬民主，使校务委员会发生应有的作用。同时，应该适当地吸收有代表性的讲师、助教参加。盐吃多了，不一定经验就丰富了；头发白了，不一定七窍玲珑，比青年人更能全面深入地考虑问题。特别是在这个过渡时期，让新老两代坐在一个会议席上，让存在着的新老矛盾暴露出来，共同寻求解决，比较让老年人和青年人形成了在朝和在野的对峙局面，情况要好得多。所谓“教授治校”，顾名思义，就没有这个优点。
    校长负责制这个制度是优越的，必须坚持下去。单就这一点来看，“教授治校”的口号也是不恰当的。这里顺便说明一下：如果校长同时是一个党员，他是以校长的身份来处理校务，不是以党员（或党委书记）的身份来处理校务的，正如周总理是以国务院总理的身份来处理国务一样。反对党委以党代政应该是反对党委会对学校行政作出决定，而不是反对校长本人对学校行政作出决定。如果因为反对“党委以党代政”而反对校长负责制，那就不对了。
    提出“教授治校”的先生们喜欢举出解放前清华大学的教授会为例。我在清华大学当过十二年的教授，我明确地知道，清华的教授会正是没有讲师助教参加的（抗战前的专任讲师参加了，因为清华的“专任讲师”等于副教授）；由教授会产生的评议会好像资本主义国家的责任内阁，而当年清华的校长几乎等于今天英国的女王。
    “教授治校”只是空洞的一个漂亮名词，事实上是行不通的。假定一个大学有一百多位教授，又假定他们每一个人都肯牺牲一部分科学研究时间，一百多人坐在一起，对于许多具体的行政事务怎样进行讨论呢？清华当年设立评议会，就是要补救这个缺点。但是，毛病从此产生了：由教授选出的评议会逐渐脱离了群众，成为寡头政治。教授会所讨论的往往只是每年学生的毕业名单，关于学生体育不及格该不该毕业的问题常常争论半天；至于一切大政方针和重要措施却完全掌握在评议会，教授们不便过问。这种资产阶级的“民主”，我觉得没有什么可以效法的地方。
    社会主义制度的优越性应该先肯定下来。一个制度不完善，我们应该在马克思主义思想的指导下，要求做到更加完善，而不应该一味留恋过去，让大家后退一二十年。
