Luo Ziwei Proposes Seven Suggestions for Improving the Relationship Between the Party and Non-Party Members
Luo Ziwei spoke last. He talked about the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, with a focus on the relationship between the Party and administration. He said that in terms of the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the main aspect of the contradiction is the Party.

How to improve the relationship between the Party and non-Party members? He analyzed three situations: First, non-Party members have positions and power. He works in the Handicraft Industry Administration, and he cited his own situation as an illustration. Second, there are positions with partial power. Third, there are positions without power. The situations involving positions and power are: First, state organs are responsible by the Party group. The Party group discusses the general direction, policies, and major decisions. Whether non-Party leaders have positions and power depends on whether they can participate in the Party group discussions. Some participated and felt they had positions and power. Some did not participate, and the Party group informed the non-Party leaders after the decision, which made the non-Party leaders feel powerless. Second, the administrative work of the organs is a system of division of labor with individual responsibility. If the Party members under the non-Party leader listen to him in the work he is responsible for, he will have a position and power, otherwise he will feel powerless. Third, it depends on reading documents and attending meetings. There are two types of documents, one internal to the Party and one within the administrative system. Democratic personages do not see the internal Party documents, and some see them, which leads to different feelings. He said the problem often lies here. The same is true for meetings.

He said that the practices vary in these aspects because the CPC Central Committee has not made clear regulations and often leaves it to the Party group to control. When it comes to the organs, it is handed over to individual Party members to control, which leads to inconsistent practices. He cited the example that the way the report of Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference was conveyed was different. Some units only conveyed it among Party members; some units conveyed it among cadres above a certain level, regardless of Party affiliation, and some Party members were not satisfied if they did not hear it; some conveyed it to all staff. He said that this is because the boundaries of the system are not clear.

He said that the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is not necessarily the responsibility of the Party member when it comes down to a specific person. He said that when he used to work in a unit, there were three people together, only one of whom was a Party member, and the three got along well. Later, he left that unit, but the two people had disagreements. Whose responsibility is this? He said it was unclear who was right and who was wrong.

When talking about how to implement the issue of having positions and power, he proposed:

First, the CPC Central Committee should make clear regulations: When the Party group of an organ holds a meeting to discuss major issues, such as expanded meetings, responsible persons from both Party and non-Party members should participate; when discussing a certain business, relevant non-Party leaders should also participate. As for the issue of confidentiality, he said non-Party leaders would understand. It should also be stipulated that each organ must implement a system of division of labor with individual responsibility. This can increase the sense of responsibility of non-Party members, promote work competition, and promote the study of business. It should also be stipulated that non-Party leaders should see documents that fall within the scope of work and business. With these regulations, the Party group can control better, and Party members can easily understand. Second, the Party group represents the Central Committee to be responsible for controlling the general direction and promoting the implementation of administration. As for the guarantee, it can be the responsibility of the general Party branch of the organ. Third, the role and status of democratic parties in the organs should be clarified. Opportunities should be given to non-Party and non-factional democratic personages to express their opinions. Fourth, some organs do not pay much attention to non-Party members, some do not care enough, and some veteran cadres are overly vigilant, which makes non-Party members feel unimportant. The Party does not educate new Party members enough, and their words and actions have bad aspects, so education should be strengthened for them. Fifth, democratic parties have not examined the relationship between the Party and non-Party members for several years, and they should check it, which will have an educational effect on members. Sixth, conduct United Front Work education among the broad masses of Party members. Seventh, non-Party members should also make conscious efforts to improve the relationship between the Party and non-Party members.

He also talked about the issue of Party members making friends with non-Party members. Finally, he hoped that the practice of the Party inviting non-Party members to hold symposiums like this one could be established as a system and held regularly. In addition, regular inspections should be carried out. In this way, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members will improve.

Chen Qiyou said: We should assist democratic parties in establishing and enriching organizational structures, and give democratic parties a certain political status and rights.

Chen Qiyou made a written statement at the meeting on the morning of the 30th. In his written statement, he first talked about the issue of implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." He believes that in order to truly implement the policy of long-term coexistence, so that democratic parties can truly play a role in mutual supervision, they should be given the conditions for democratic parties to coexist and supervise, and democratic parties themselves must also create the conditions to undertake this task.

What are the conditions for giving democratic parties coexistence and supervision? He believes that the leading party should do the following three aspects of work well: First, assist democratic parties in establishing and enriching organizational structures. Democratic parties need to represent and contact their specific classes and people, and at the same time help them carry out ideological transformation, which requires establishing organizational structures in some cities, and then improving and enriching these institutions in order to normally carry out their work. However, whether it is establishing institutions or enriching institutions, it is impossible without the support of the Communist Party. Therefore, he advocated that when democratic parties need to establish institutions in some cities, as long as this democratic party has enough work to do in this city, the leading party should give favorable conditions for establishing institutions. When a democratic party needs to transfer its members (he himself agrees) back to the party to work, as long as his original organ is not indispensable to him, he should give assistance to enrich the institutions of the democratic party. In the past, some local United Front Work Departments, such as the Guangdong United Front Work Department, did not do enough in this regard, and I had a very embarrassing experience once when I wanted to transfer a member of the Zhi Gong Party back to the party to support the work.

Second, give democratic parties a certain political status and rights. He said that now democratic parties are said to be equal in theory, but in fact, in the eyes of many people (of course, including some comrades of the United Front Work Department), it is different. I feel that the leading party has not supported our Zhi Gong Party enough in the past. At the First CPPCC meeting, the Zhi Gong Party, as one of the democratic parties, did not even have a seat on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. Therefore, in order to carry out some work, in order to make fewer mistakes in our work, and in order to urgently know some decisions of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, we can only inquire from private friends. This cannot be said to have no hindrance to the work of the Zhi Gong Party. Although the situation has improved somewhat today, there is still a phenomenon of valuing the big and not the small. There are many major things that we must know, but we still do not have the opportunity to know them in a timely manner, so that we cannot guide the work of the Zhi Gong Party in a timely and correct manner.

Third, we should encourage democratic parties to give play to the spirit of being masters of their own affairs and help them carry out ideological transformation. Now many people reflect that democratic parties have a sense of inferiority, but this is not born with them, it is caused by the environment. Because they cannot see sufficiently comprehensive materials, they cannot have more comprehensive opinions. Uncomprehensive opinions are not completely without reference value, but they are easily met with extremely cold reactions, and there is even a danger of being labeled. In addition, they have encountered many manifestations of the sense of superiority of Communist Party members, and over time, they cannot help but develop a sense of inferiority.

We hope that the leading party will vigorously assist democratic parties from the three aspects of organization, politics, and ideology, so that democratic parties have the conditions to undertake the role of supervision.

He Requests the Restoration of Jinan University

Secondly, Chen Qiyou talked about the issue of requesting the restoration of Jinan University. He said that overseas Chinese love the culture of the motherland and want their children to receive education in the motherland. Sending their children back to China to study is worthy of our welcome. However, at present, cultural and educational construction cannot keep up with the rapid increase in people's needs for cultural life, and there is a phenomenon that a considerable number of high school graduates will not be able to enter universities this year. Among them, there will be a part of overseas Chinese students who graduated from high schools in China and overseas Chinese students who graduated from high schools abroad and returned to China to take the university entrance examination. In order to solve this problem, our Zhi Gong Party has suggested to the CPPCC to restore Jinan University, which was originally in Shanghai, because Jinan University and Xiamen University have the same reputation in the overseas Chinese community and are loved by the majority of overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese hope to restore Jinan University. I hope the state can consider this request. Chen Qiyou also put forward some opinions on the residence and migration issues of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives. He said that the constitution has provisions on the freedom of residence and migration, but because of the supply of materials and the guarantee of agricultural productivity, we cannot allow the population of some large cities to expand freely. Therefore, it is necessary to impose some restrictions and management on the migration of rural residents to cities. However, as far as returned overseas Chinese and their relatives are concerned, many of them do not have the labor force and rely on foreign exchange to maintain their lives. If they leave the countryside and come to the city, it will not have much impact on agricultural productivity. As for the supply of materials, it is better to let them move to the city than to give them some special care in the countryside, which is easy to cause dissatisfaction among farmers. In addition to the above opinions, Chen Qiyou also put forward some opinions on wage reform and price issues.

Mao Yisheng Analyzes the Reasons for the Formation of "Walls" and "Gullies" from Eight Aspects and Proposes Some Methods to Dismantle Walls and Fill Gullies.

Mao Yisheng made a written statement on the question of how "walls" and "gullies" are formed. He said: Now everyone is talking about the "walls" and "gullies" between the Party and the masses, but I think such walls and gullies have existed not only between the Party and the masses in recent years, but also between the masses themselves, between various organs, between organs and the masses, between laymen and experts in business, and between yesterday and today in time. Is the widespread existence of so many walls and gullies, and the fact that they have existed for several years, a surprising and serious problem? I don't think so. These are all man-made products, not born with them, and the original manpower can still be used to remove the walls and fill the gullies.

Mao Yisheng believes that everyone has said a lot about the reasons for the formation of walls and gullies, and the following points can be added:

(1) Enthusiasm for work. In socialist transformation and socialist construction, people have different degrees of enthusiasm. However, because the degree of enthusiasm is different, there will gradually be walls and gullies. Those with poor enthusiasm see that their political level is not as high as others, and they cannot learn it well for a while, so they have to retreat when things happen, dare not regard themselves as masters, first retreat to be guests, and then retreat to be visitors. The real thoughts and language are kept in their minds all year round. Work always has to be done by someone. Since there are people who retreat, there must be people who act on their behalf, and the difference in enthusiasm will become greater and greater. In this way, the so-called having a position without power, the separation of Party and government, and the inability to use force are problems that arise.

(2) Organizational structure with longitude but no latitude. Our organizational structure often has a big shortcoming, that is, many organizational structures only have a vertical system and no horizontal connections. Being in it, you cannot help but run into walls from time to time. For example, in the same place, there can be several systems of the same work in progress, but each does its own thing, without caring for each other, let alone having anything in common. Seeing such waste, I know that I am insignificant and do not know where to start, so I have to stand by. In fact, this is the organizational structure with longitude but no latitude. This kind of cloth is very good-looking when it is tightened, but when you let go a little, it will be full of flaws. I think such an organizational structure should be studied and reorganized.

(3) Highly centralized business planning. The superiority of the socialist system lies in overall planning and national unification, and also requires a high degree of discipline in order to implement the guidelines and policies. However, China is a large country with a large population, the situation in various places is very complex, the economic and educational foundation is very weak, and science is very backward. Therefore, when formulating a plan, it is difficult to make it perfect due to too many factors and the difficulty in collecting data. Even if it is correct when it is formulated, the situation will change when it is implemented in various places. This is a highly scientific work, and it is difficult to do it perfectly with the existing scientific level in our country. However, the plans and tasks set by the higher authorities must be implemented by the lower authorities, so it is inevitable to make the mistake of commandism, and there will inevitably be walls and gullies between cadres and the masses. Now everyone often says that the higher authorities are managing too tightly and rigidly, but the higher authorities also have reasons for having to manage in this way. If we distinguish between priorities in the plan, reserve flexibility, which must be centralized by the central government, which can be allowed to have a "free market," which must be completed, and which can be flexible, and decentralize power as much as possible, and gradually adjust the ratio of centralization and decentralization with the progress of science and technology, I think the lower-level cadres can always use their brains to unify the contradiction between what is needed and what is possible.

(4) Flexible application of the government's orders. Because socialist construction is a new experience, the government's orders must change with the changing situation, which is inevitable. It is an overstatement to think that changes in government orders will affect the government's credibility. All government orders are for the benefit of the people and are well-intentioned, but sometimes there is a one-sidedness of "doing to others what you want them to do to you." Therefore, there are right and wrong issues here, and there should be an explanation. If it was wrong before, admitting the mistake is upright and bright. The most inappropriate thing is to stubbornly say that what is not is, and also say that this is a "dialectical unity," which blocks the way for people to speak and rejects people thousands of miles away. Therefore, government orders can and should be applied flexibly, but there must be sufficient basis; you cannot be impulsive, advancing rashly for a while, and being conservative for a while, making the lower authorities conscientious and at a loss, which creates walls and gullies between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses. The ancients said that people cannot stand without faith. It is not easy to maintain this word of faith, and the experience of the past few years is worth recalling deeply.

(5) Organization and allocation of work cadres. After liberation, the government's personnel system has undergone fundamental changes, that is, to "obey organizational allocation." This has achieved great results in eliminating the various malpractices of the old system, changing customs and habits, and creating a new atmosphere, which is indeed a new atmosphere in the new China. However, those who are assigned should obey, which is an obligation, and the organization that implements the allocation should proceed cautiously and truly achieve consistency between learning and application and suitability between people and places, which is considered to have fulfilled its responsibility, but this is not always the case in reality, which affects the enthusiasm of those who are allocated. Originally, allocating cadres is an extremely difficult task, but the cadres in charge of personnel in general organizations rarely have expertise, so the phenomenon of matching the wrong couples is not surprising. What suffers is that the person who is matched may regret it for the rest of his life. This is first expressed in work efficiency, which becomes a great waste. I suggest that in the establishment of each organ, can one-quarter of the authorized size be reserved and compiled in the "free market?" These people are considered inappropriate by the leaders at all levels of the organ, or they themselves think that they are not suitable, so that the free markets of each organ can freely circulate with each other.

(6) Surplus or deficiency of spare time. Senior intellectuals say that five-sixths of their business time is not guaranteed, and even some scientists say that with such a long-term "failure to do their job," China's science is facing a crisis. However, at the same time, in various organs, there are many people who do very little work and even have five-sixths of their time doing nothing every day. This situation of surplus and deficiency is a waste on the one hand, and also affects enthusiasm, creating walls and gullies. In capitalist countries, there is a saying, "Time is money." If we change the word money to "work," this sentence also applies to us. We must do everything possible to reduce the waste of time. For example, meetings can be streamlined in various ways: announce the exact time of opening and closing of meetings in advance, regardless of large or small meetings; all written reports do not need to be read out at the meetings; people who speak should report how many minutes they will speak first; and all speeches that can be transmitted by radio should not be reported at meetings.

(7) The boundless requirements of confidentiality. In any country, the confidentiality system is very important, especially since we are still continuing the anti-espionage campaign. However, confidentiality must have restrictions. If it is used as a shield, thinking that all official business can be kept confidential and developing it boundlessly, then wherever confidentiality goes, there will inevitably be walls and gullies. Some people say that in recent years, in the office, many documents cannot be read, many things cannot be asked, and at home, all official business cannot be said, and any work cannot be written. When colleagues meet, they do not talk about the main text, and academic reports cannot avoid empty talk. Sometimes professors take students to practice, but they cannot visit factories, and engineers cannot find the necessary materials to do designs. As a result of such confidentiality, coupled with the organizational structure having longitude but no latitude, it greatly hinders the understanding of relevant situations and the exchange of experiences. Good things cannot be promoted, and bad things cannot be detected. It not only promotes departmentalism and even closed-doorism, but also maintains confidentiality with each other and does its own thing, forming a great waste. From the perspective of education and culture, knowledge is like water, which decays if it does not flow. Everyone keeps secrets, how can academic exchanges be carried out and how can the level be improved? I suggest that, except for the requirements of national defense, the confidentiality system for all scientific and technological materials should be cancelled as soon as possible, so that it can circulate freely at home and abroad and better play its role.

(8) The harm of bureaucracy. Forty years ago, when I was studying in the United States, I heard someone say that "communism cannot succeed in the United States because it brings bureaucracy, which is what we hate the most." In the early days of liberation, I couldn't help but recall this sentence. However, in the spring of 1950, the Ministry of Railways widely publicized "eradicating the bureaucratic work style in the railway system" in the railway system, proving that the rumors made by those Americans were baseless. However, from the "Three Antis" to now, we have been opposing bureaucracy, which shows that this bad work style is quite deeply rooted in China. It has become so deeply rooted that no one is ashamed of corruption, but when it comes to their own bureaucracy, it seems that they are indifferent, but in fact it is equally harmful. I believe that bureaucracy is a high wall and a deep gully, and we must thoroughly investigate its root causes and gradually eliminate it. This is not only an educational issue, but more importantly, we must formulate various rules and regulations, break the dependent thinking of eating dry food and doing less work, cultivate the initiative of spontaneous struggle, and eliminate the possibility of bureaucracy.

Since the contention in various places, a thought-provoking phenomenon is that the contradictions revealed in various places and aspects have great commonality. It is precisely because of this that the handling of these contradictions can be simplified. This requires the Communist Party organization, on a national scale, not only to rectify the style of Party members within the Party, but also to unite the people of the whole country, conduct education, distinguish right from wrong, and determine merits and demerits, in order to consolidate our people's democratic system and accelerate our socialist construction. It can be asserted that through this upsurge of promoting democracy, the whole world can see the correctness of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the greatness of the rectification movement, and the brightness of the future of the Chinese people.

### 在统战部召开的民主人士座谈会上的发言（续昨）

专栏：

   在统战部召开的民主人士座谈会上的发言（续昨）
    罗子为提出改进党与非党关系的七点建议
    罗子为最后发言。他谈的是党与党外人士的关系问题，又偏重谈党与行政的关系问题。他说，从党与非党的关系来说，矛盾的主要方面是党。
    如何搞好党与非党的关系？他分析现在有三种情况：一种是非党人士有职有权。他在手工业管理局工作，他举他自己的情况作为说明。第二种是有职有部分权。第三种是有职无权。涉及到职权问题的情况是：第一，国家机关是由党组负责，对方针、政策、重大决定，都由党组讨论。非党负责人是不是有职有权，在于能不能参加党组讨论。有的参加了，就觉得有职有权。有的没有参加，党组决定后告诉给非党负责人，这就使非党负责人感到有职无权。第二，机关行政工作是分工负责制。非党负责人分担的工作，如果下面的党员干部听他的，就会有职有权，否则就觉得有职无权。第三，看文件，参加会的问题。文件有两种，一种是党内的，一种是行政系统的。党内的文件，民主人士看不到，有的也看到了，这就有不同的感觉。他说问题就往往出在这上面。会议也是如此。
    他说，这些方面，做法各有不同，这是因为中共中央没有明确规定，而往往交给党组去掌握。到了机关，又交给党员个人去掌握，这就变得作法不一致了。他举例说，毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告的传达作法就不一样，有的单位只在党员中传达；有的单位在某级以上干部中传达，不分党内外，有的党员没有听到也不满意；有的在全体工作人员中传达。他说这是制度界限不明确。
    他说，党与非党关系，在具体到这个人和那个人的时候，就不一定是党员的责任。他说从前他在一个单位工作的时候，三个人在一起，其中只有一个党员，三人相处得还融洽。后来他离开那个单位，但那两个人却闹起意见来。这是谁的责任呢？他说是非不清。
    谈到如何贯彻有职有权问题时，他提议：
    第一，中共中央要做明确的规定：机关党组开会讨论重大问题时，如是扩大会议，党和非党的负责人员都参加；讨论某项业务时，有关非党负责人也参加。至于保密问题，他说非党负责人是会懂得的。还应规定：各机关必须贯彻分工负责制。这样可以加重非党人士的责任感，也可以推动工作竞赛，推动钻研业务。还应规定：凡属于工作、业务范围的文件，应该让非党负责人看。作了这些规定，党组好掌握，党员容易明确。第二，党组代表中央负责掌握方针政策，推动行政贯彻。至于保证，可以由机关党总支负责。第三，应明确机关民主党派的作用和地位。给无党无派民主人士表达意见的机会。第四，机关对非党人士，有的不大注意，有的关心不够，有的老干部警惕性过高，使非党人士觉得不受重视。党对新党员教育不够，说话行动都有不好的地方，应加强对他们的教育。第五，民主党派几年来没有检查过党与非党的关系问题，应该检查检查，会对成员有教育作用。第六，在广大党员中进行统战工作教育。第七，非党人士也应在改善党与非党关系问题上，作自觉的努力。
    他还谈到党员与非党人士交朋友的问题。最后他希望像这次党邀请党外人士开座谈会的做法，能够订为制度，定期举行。另外还要定期进行检查。这样党与非党关系就会好起来。陈其尤说：应当协助民主党派建立和充实组织机构，给予民主党派一定的政治地位和权利。
     陈其尤在30日上午的会议上作了书面发言。在他的书面发言中，首先谈到关于贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”方针的问题。他认为：要切实贯彻长期共存的方针，使民主党派真正能够起到互相监督的作用，就应该给民主党派能够共存和监督的条件，而民主党派自己也必须创造能担负起这一任务的条件。
    怎样才是给民主党派共存和监督的条件呢？他认为领导党要做好以下三方面的工作：第一，协助民主党派建立和充实组织机构。民主党派需要代表、联系他们特定的阶层和人士，同时帮助他们进行思想改造，这就要在某些城市建立组织机构，进而健全充实这些机构，才可能正常开展它们的工作。但不管是建立机构或者是充实机构，没有共产党的支持是办不到的。因此，他主张当民主党派需要在某些城市建立机构时，只要这一民主党派在这一城市中有足够的工作好做，领导党就应给予建立机构的有利条件。当民主党派需要调动其成员（他本人同意）回党工作时，只要他原机关不是非他不可时，就应该给他协助，借以充实民主党派的机构。这一点过去某些地方统战部如广东统战部是做得很不够的，我曾有一次为了要调动一位致公党的成员回党支援工作，就受过极难堪的遭遇。
    第二，给予民主党派一定的政治地位和权利。他说，现在各民主党派在理论上说是平等的，而实际上在很多人（当然也包括统战部的某些同志）的眼中却不一样。我觉得过去领导党对我们致公党的工作是支持不够的。第一届政协会议时，作为民主党派之一的致公党居然没有在政协常委会中占一席位，因此，使我们为了开展一些工作，为了使我们的工作少出错误，急需知道某些政协常委会的决定时，也只能从私人朋友方面去打听。这对于致公党的工作不能说没有妨碍。今天这种情况虽然有一些改进，但仍存在着重大不重小的现象，有很多重大事情我们必须知道的，但我们仍没有机会能及时地知道，以致我们无法及时正确指导致公党的工作。
    第三，应鼓励民主党派发挥当家作主的精神，和帮助进行思想改造，现在不少人反映民主党派有自卑感，但这并不是天生就自卑，这是由于环境造成的。由于他们不可能看到足够全面的材料，因此也就不可能有较全面的意见。不全面的意见提出来也并不是完全没有参考的价值，但却很容易遭到极冷淡的反应，甚至会有被扣帽子的危险，再加上他们碰到了不少共产党员的优越感的表现，久而久之，不能不养成自卑感。
    我们希望领导党从组织、政治和思想三方面大力协助民主党派，使民主党派有条件承担起监督作用。
      他要求恢复暨南大学
    其次，陈其尤谈到要求恢复暨南大学的问题。他说，华侨热爱祖国文化，要求子女接受祖国教育，送子女回国升学，是值得我们欢迎的。但在目前文教建设还一时不能适应人民对于文化生活迅速提高的需要，出现了今年将有相当多的高中毕业生不能升进大学的现象。其中将会有一部分是在国内高中毕业的华侨学生和国外高中毕业回国报考大学的华侨学生。为了解决这一问题，我们致公党曾向政协建议将原来在上海的暨南大学复校，因为暨南大学和厦门大学在国外华侨的社会中具有同等的声誉，受到广大侨胞的爱护，许多侨胞都希望恢复暨南大学。希望国家能够考虑这个要求。对于归侨、侨眷的居住和迁徙问题，陈其尤也提出了意见。他说，宪法上有居住和迁徙自由的规定，但我们因为物资供应和保证农业生产力的关系，不能使一些大城市的人口自由膨胀。因此，对乡村居民移居城市加以若干限制和管理，这是有必要的。但以归侨侨眷而言，则他们很多是没有劳动力靠外汇维持生活的，他们若离开乡村到城市来，对农业生产力不会有多大的影响，至于物质供应，与其让他们在乡村受到一些特殊的照顾，而又容易引起农民不满，倒不如让他移居城市为好。除以上意见以外，陈其尤还对工资改革和物价问题提出了一些意见。茅以升从八个方面来分析形成“墙”和“沟”的原因，提出一些拆墙填沟的办法。
    茅以升就“墙”和“沟”是怎样形成的问题做了书面发言。他说：现在各地都在谈党群之间的“墙”和“沟”的问题，但我看像这样的墙和沟，这几年来，不仅存在于党群之间，而且也存在于群众彼此之间，存在于各机关之间，存在于机关与群众之间，存在于业务上的外行与内行之间，存在于时间上的昨天与今天之间。这样多的墙和沟的普遍的存在，而且已经存在了几年之久，是不是一个令人惊异的严重问题呢？我看不是的。这都是些人工的产物，不是天生成的，仍用原来的人工，是可以把墙拆除，把沟填平的。
    茅以升认为形成墙和沟的原因大家说了很多，还可补充以下几点：
    （1）工作上的积极性。在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，人们是都具有不同程度的积极性的。然而就因积极性的程度有所不同，其间就逐渐地会有了墙和沟。积极性差的，看到自己的政治水平不如人高，一时又学不好，只得遇事退缩，不敢以主人自居，先退为陪客，再退为来宾，真实的思想语言，常年闷在脑中。工作总是要人作的，既有退缩的人，就必然有代庖的人，积极性的差别，也就愈来愈大了。这样，就发生了所谓有职无权，党政不分，有力无法使等等的问题。
    （2）组织机构的有经无纬。我们的组织机构往往有个很大缺点，这就是很多组织机构只有垂直系统而无横的联系，身处其中，就不免时时碰壁。比如同一地方，就可有几个系统的同样工作在进行，而各搞一套，互不关怀，更谈不到有无相通。看到这样的浪费，自顾人微言轻，不知从何说起，只好袖手旁观。其实，这就是组织机构的有经无纬，这样的布，在绷紧时，光彩绚烂，是很好看的，但稍一松手，就破绽百出了。我认为，像这样的组织机构是应当研究改组的。
    （3）业务计划的高度集中。社会主义制度的优越性在全盘计划化和全国统一化，同时也需要高度纪律性，以求方针政策的贯彻。但是，中国是个人口众多的大国，各地情况非常复杂，经济和教育的基础都很薄弱，而科学又十分落后，因此，在制订一个计划时，由于因素太多，而且资料搜集不易，就很难作得尽善尽美。纵然制订的时候是对的，等到各地实行的时候，情况又变了。这是一个高度科学性的工作，在我国现有科学水平上是很难做得完美的。但是，上面订的计划和任务，在下面看起来，就必须要贯彻执行，因而就难免要犯命令主义的错误，在干部与群众之间就难免有墙和沟了。现在各地常说，上边管的太紧太死，但上边也有必须要这样管的理由。如果在计划中分别轻重，预留伸缩，哪些是必须由中央集中的，哪些是可以容许有“自由市场”的，哪些是必须要完成的，哪些是可以有伸缩的，尽量把事权下放，并且把集中和分散的比例，随着科学技术的进步而逐步加以调节，我想下面干部就可经常开动脑筋，如何来统一这需要与可能的矛盾了。
    （4）机关政令的灵活运用。由于社会主义建设是新的经验，机关政令必须随着情况变化而不免于更改，这是势所必至的，那种认为政令变更就会影响到政府威信的说法是过虑的。一切政令都是为了人民利益，都是好意，但有时也有“己之所欲，强施于人”的片面性，因而，这里面就有是非问题，
  而且应当有所交代。如果以前是错了，承认错误是磊落光明的，最不应该的，是强词夺理地把不是的说成是，还说这是“辩证的统一”，这就阻塞言路，拒人于千里之外
  了。因此，政令是可以而且应该灵活运用的，但必须要有充分根据；不能心血来潮，一时冒进，一时保守，弄得下边兢兢业业，无所适从，这就在上下级之间，干部与群众之间，造成墙与沟了。古话说民无信不立，要维持这个信字，确不简单，过去这几年的经验是很值得深切回忆的。
    （5）工作干部的组织分配。解放后，政府机构的人事制度有了根本性的变革，就是要“服从组织分配”。这在扫除旧制度的种种积弊上，获得了极大的成效，移风易俗，观感一新，确是新中国的新气象。然而，被分配者应当服从，自是一种义务，而执行分配的组织，就应当慎重从事，真正做到学用一致，人地相宜，那才算尽了责任，但实际又不尽然，这就影响了被分配的积极性。本来，调配干部是件极繁难的工作，而一般组织中主管人事的干部很少“内行”，于是“乱点鸳鸯谱”的现象，就不足为奇了，所苦的是被点的人可能抱恨终身。这首先表示在工作效率上，成为很大浪费。我建议，在各机关编制中，可否保留四分之一的定员，编在“自由市场”中，这些人就是本机关各级领导认为不适当，或自认不相宜的，让各机关的自由市场，相互自由流通。
    （6）业余时间的有余不足。高级知识分子都说六分之五的业务时间没有保证，甚至有的科学家说，像这样长期的“不务正业”，中国的科学就要面临危机。但是，同时在各机关中，都有很多的人，工作很少，每天甚至有六分之五的时间无事做。像这样有余不足的情况，一方面是浪费，另一方面也影响了积极性，造成了墙与沟。在资本主义国家，流行着一句话，叫做“时间就是钱”，如果把钱字改成“工作”，这句话对我们也适用的。必须千方百计地减少时间上的浪费，比如开会，就可用种种方法精简：不论大会小会预先宣布开会散会的准确时间；凡有书面的报告，不用在会上宣读；发言的人，先自报讲几分钟；凡可利用广播传达的讲话，一律不开会报告。
    （7）保密要求的无边无际。在任何国家，保密制度都是非常重要的，何况我们现在还在继续肃反之中。然而保密要有限制，如果把它当作挡箭牌，认为一切公事皆可保密，无边无际地发展下去，那末，保密所到之处，就必然是墙沟所到之处了。有人说这些年来，在办公室里，很多文件看不得，很多事体问不得，回到家里，一切公事说不得，任何工作写不得。同行相遇，不谈正文，学术报告，不免空话。有时教授带学生实习，参观不了工厂，工程师做设计，找不到必需的材料。这样保密的结果，加上机构组织的有经无纬，就大大妨碍了对有关情况的了解和经验的交流，好的无从推广，坏的无法觉察，不但助长了本位主义甚或关门主义，而且彼此保密，各搞一套，形成极大的浪费。从教育文化来说，知识如水，不流生腐，大家保密，学术如何交流，水平如何提高？我建议，除因国防上的要求外，对于一切科学技术资料的保密制度应从速考虑取消，让它能在国内外自由流通，更好发挥它的作用。
    （8）官僚主义的危害性。四十年前我在美国留学就听到有人谈起“共产主义在美国是无法成功的，因为它带来了官僚主义，而这是我们最厌恶的”。在解放初期，我就不由地回忆起这句话。但是，在1950年春，铁道部就在铁道系统中大规模地宣传“铲除铁路系统中的官僚主义作风”，证明了那些美国人制造的谣言是毫无根据的。然而，从“三反”到现在，我们还是一直在反对官僚主义，也可见这个坏作风在中国是相当地根深蒂固的了。它已经根深蒂固到这种程度，就是人无不以贪污为耻，但是谈到自己的官僚主义，就仿佛无动于中，其实是同样地有危害性的。我认为官僚主义就是高墙深沟，必须要穷其根源，逐步肃清。这不仅是教育问题，更重要的是要定出各种规章制度，打破吃干薪、少做事的依赖思想，养成自发奋斗的积极性，杜绝官僚主义产生的可能性。
    自从各地争鸣以后，一个值得令人深思的现象，是各地各方面所揭露的矛盾有很大的共同性。也正因如此，处理这些矛盾倒很可简单化了。这就需要共产党的组织，在全国范围内，不但在党内整党员之风，还要团结全国人民，进行教育，分清是非，判明功过，来巩固我们人民民主制度，来加速我们社会主义建设。可以断言，通过这次发扬民主的高潮，全世界都可看到党的鸣放方针的正确，整风运动的伟大和中国人民前途的光明。
