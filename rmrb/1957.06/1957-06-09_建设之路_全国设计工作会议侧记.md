The Road to Construction
    ——Notes from the National Design Work Conference
    By our reporters Zhang Pei and Ye Jianyun

    Although June in Beijing is the season when swallows carry away the spring, the fragrance of flowers and the singing of birds are not inferior to the spring scenery. It was at this time that we attended the first National Design Work Conference jointly convened by the State Construction Commission, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and other agencies. At the meeting, we heard representatives sing the prelude to the road of building the country diligently and thriftily in the future.
    Achievements are fundamental

    At the meeting, the representatives discussed many issues. The first was to evaluate the construction work of the past few years.
    The evaluation was affirmative: the achievements were fundamental and primary, while the errors and shortcomings were secondary, and some were unavoidable.
    Some people said that the Communist Party likes to use the phrase "achievements are fundamental, deviations and errors are individual" when making reports and propaganda. "After saying seven good things, then comes a shortcoming, which together is just a new stereotype."
    Some people said that this is also a manifestation of "dogmatism." Is that really the case? The answer is: no. Some people seem to have forgotten these well-known facts, or deliberately ignore them. But facts are ultimately invincible. The conference once again demonstrated these undeniable facts:
    China's first Five-Year Plan has achieved a great victory and has begun to change the face of China's economy. First, the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, and the system of exploitation of man by man has basically ended. This is a great and historically significant achievement. Second, industrial and agricultural production has greatly developed. The industrial and agricultural production in 1956 basically reached the original targets for 1957. Basic construction investment (including investment in 1957) is expected to exceed the original Five-Year Plan investment of 42.74 billion yuan by about 8%. Many new factories that China had never had before have been built, and the era of not being able to manufacture a car or an airplane has passed. Cars and new airplanes with the "Made in China" logo have appeared. During the Kuomintang rule, the highest annual steel production was only over 900,000 tons, now it has increased to over 4 million tons; cotton yarn has increased from over 2 million pieces to over 4 million pieces; from 1950 to 1957 (planned figures), grain production has increased by 150 billion jin. The proportion of industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture has greatly increased. Many things that we didn't know in the past, many things we didn't understand, we have now initially learned with the help of Soviet comrades, and have begun to design some complex projects ourselves.

    Aren't all these achievements? Is it "new stereotype" to talk about these objective facts? Affirming achievements is affirming the progress of our country, affirming the progress of our people, and affirming the fruits of the hard work of the national working people. Negating everything is something that the people of the whole country do not agree with. I don't know why, some people verbally agree with socialism, but they don't like the achievements of socialist construction.
    While evaluating achievements, the representatives also realistically criticized the past shortcomings and errors. In order to explore the correct path of construction in the future, the shortcomings and errors discussed outweighed the achievements. But we must affirm: "Achievements are fundamental and primary." This was the common voice at the meeting.

        China's National Conditions

    People did not avoid shortcomings.
    What are the main shortcomings in construction work? This question was one of the main contents of this meeting's exploration. Waste, spending too much money, means that some of our construction is not very consistent with China's current situation. It's a bit like a child who is not yet one year old wearing an adult's hat. Some geological teams and forest logging teams living in remote mountains and wilderness areas have built three or four-story Western-style buildings, while the surrounding farmers live in thatched huts and straw houses. In contrast, those who see it have opinions, and those who live in it are uncomfortable. After three years of recovery and five years of economic and cultural construction, our national economy has greatly developed compared with eight years ago. However, our country is still a relatively backward country in terms of economy and culture. We are a big country, but a poor country. By poor, we mean backward in economy and technology. Although our country produces more than 4 million tons of steel and nearly 120 million tons of coal every year, and can also manufacture cars and airplanes itself, the output is very small when calculated per capita of 600 million people. Although the country is large, the arable land is very small, with less than three mu of arable land per capita. In Sichuan Province, there is only 1.8 mu per capita. China has more than 600 million people, and the population increases by 13 million every year. If each person eats one more jin of rice and wears one more chi of cloth, it would be enough for some small European countries to produce for a year. The country is poor, the population is large, and there is very little arable land. This is our national condition. Due to insufficient analysis of China's national conditions in the construction work of the past few years, the practice of being greedy for more, being greedy for big, and blindly pursuing high standards has appeared. Generally speaking, more non-productive construction has been carried out in the past few years, and the standards have been higher. In the five years, non-productive construction (including 1957) is about 200 million square meters, with an investment of about 12 billion yuan; the total basic construction investment in the first Five-Year Plan is 42.74 billion yuan, and the investment in non-productive construction accounts for 28% of the basic construction investment in the Five-Year Plan.

    If we save half of it, 6 billion yuan, to build factories, we can build more than ten factories of the same scale as the First Automobile Works.

    The Issue of Having or Not Having and High Standards

    Precisely because our country is still a poor country, our production level is low, and the people's living standards are not high, the urgent task to change the poor and backward face is to build more factories and more mines. That is to say, the first thing to solve is the issue of having or not having and how much. Since we don't have many things yet, and some are still very few, we must implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily when carrying out construction with limited funds. What we need are factories, but not factories that look beautiful on the outside.
    In the past, due to a lack of in-depth understanding of China's national conditions and an improper estimate of China's national strength, many measures were not entirely in line with the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily.
    There is a factory in Xi'an that occupies 60 hectares of land, 40 hectares of which is for greening, and the factory area only uses 15 hectares. This situation of requisitioning too much land and using too little, requisitioning early and using late, and requisitioning without using is quite common. According to statistics, 20 million mu of land have been requisitioned for construction in the past few years. So far, only 75 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed nationwide; moreover, the requisitioned land is mostly good land. In the Xi'an area, the requisitioned land is the rice-producing land of the 800-li Qin Chuan, with an average annual grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu. The land requisitioned in the Chengdu Plain of Sichuan Province has an average annual output of more than 1,200 jin per mu. If we can save a quarter of the land, that is 5 million mu; if we calculate an average annual output of 500 jin per mu, we can increase grain production by 2.5 billion jin. This amount of grain can feed 7 million people for a year.
    In addition, there are also excessively high standards in terms of construction standards. Some hygiene standards are too high, and some standards for flood prevention, fire prevention, and earthquake resistance are unrealistic.
    In terms of the level of technology and equipment adopted, there is a blind pursuit of modernization. For example, Yuxikou Port uses large coal loaders, elevated railways, and coal pit tunnels, all of which are fully mechanized. However, the Sanmin Wharf in Nanjing uses mobile belt conveyors. Although this type of coal loading equipment requires more manual labor during operation, the efficiency is not much different from that of Yuxikou's fully mechanized system, but the investment is several times less than that of Yuxikou. China has a large population and few tools. Many equipment cannot be manufactured by ourselves or cannot be manufactured in large quantities and needs to be ordered from abroad. Under the circumstances that China's industry is not strong, the technical level is not high, the financial resources are limited, and the labor force is large, considering the adoption of appropriate technical equipment can not only save foreign exchange, but also enable more people in China to have employment opportunities. Public welfare buildings also have excessively high standards.
    Who is mainly to blame for the insufficient understanding of the national conditions of "poor country," "large population," and "little land," and the excessively high standards of certain constructions? Comrade Bo Yibo said very clearly: In the past, when I was the director of the Construction Commission, the "provisional standards" were promulgated by the Construction Commission. Therefore, the shortcomings are mainly in the Construction Commission. There is subjectivism in our leadership, and we cannot blame the design personnel alone. Comrade Bo Yibo gave a vivid report to the conference in the spirit of rectification and seeking truth from facts. However, many speeches also confirmed that some shortcomings were indeed because of lack of experience and were "unavoidable." Although some people don't like to hear the words "unavoidable" now.
    The Design Work Conference is an important step in compiling the Second Five-Year Plan. It will mobilize 100,000 designers across the country to continue to advance China's socialist construction.
    Combination of Large, Medium, and Small

    The issue of the scale of enterprise construction was also one of the central topics of discussion at this meeting.
    In order to improve China's industrial and technical level and lay the foundation for national industrialization, it is necessary and should be affirmed to build a number of modern large-scale enterprises. This has been done in the past, and will continue to be done in the future. However, according to China's historical conditions and actual situation, not too many large-scale enterprises should be built. While building large-scale enterprises, more medium and small-scale enterprises should be built to combine medium and small-scale enterprises with large-scale enterprises. This is the policy of combining large, medium, and small.
    Facts have proved that building medium and small-scale enterprises has many advantages from our current actual situation. First of all, it is easier to solve the technical equipment for building more medium and small-scale enterprises. At the same time, it is also convenient to give play to domestic design forces and machinery manufacturing forces. Secondly, medium and small-scale enterprises have a short construction time, and the investment can be less, and the production benefits are faster. This can not only meet the needs of the country and the people as soon as possible, but also quickly accumulate funds. Thirdly, building more medium and small-scale enterprises can deploy more industrial points, make the distribution of productive forces more reasonable, and gradually balance the economic development between regions. Also, building more medium and small-scale enterprises can diversify products and meet the needs of all aspects.
    The combination of large, medium, and small is to combine the latest technology, general technology, and manual labor, that is, to combine state-run, locally-run, handicraft industry, and agriculture. If you only pay attention to the latest technology, you may squeeze out general technology and handicrafts. Sichuan built three large pulp mills. After completion, the annual output is 150,000 tons of pulp, which requires 300,000 tons of bamboo. However, the entire Sichuan Province only produces 500,000 tons of bamboo. Residents also use bamboo for building houses and making furniture. Local handicraft paper also uses bamboo as raw material. If the needs of these three paper mills are met, handicrafts will be squeezed out. A large part of handicrafts are rural side occupations. Squeezing out handicrafts will inevitably affect rural side occupation income. More than 500 million people in China live in rural areas, and the urban population is about 92 million. It would be extremely inappropriate if the production and living problems of the vast majority of people are not considered. The policy of combining large, medium, and small is closely linked to better implementing the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry on the basis of actively developing agriculture. This can not only enable industry to obtain raw materials to solve the market, but also take care of agriculture and handicrafts, so that they can be developed and the people can increase their income.

        Between Difficult and Easy

    Spending less money and doing more things is not a complicated thing that is incomprehensible. However, this is not a simple thing that can be understood with a single thought. To make our construction work politically correct, economically reasonable, and technically advanced and combined with general and manual labor; and to combine the present and the future, it should be said that this is a more complicated and more difficult thing. This does not reduce the responsibility of the construction workers, nor does it simplify the design work, but rather increases their responsibility and increases their work tasks. The reason for saying this is not only due to technical reasons, but more importantly, it is due to a major adjustment in thinking. That is to make all construction workers deeply understand that we are building factories, opening mines, building railways, and building bridges in a poor and backward country.
    China is a large country, and there are favorable conditions and difficulties in doing things. This year, China's total basic construction investment is 11.1 billion yuan. This figure averages less than 18 yuan per person based on a national population of over 600 million. The difficulty is that if we each consume 18 yuan more this year, the entire basic construction investment will be gone. The favorable thing is that if we each can save 5 yuan, the accumulated amount would be 3.1 billion yuan, which can build six hydropower stations of the same size as Xin'anjiang.
    People sing praises of the magnificent socialist construction, but construction is different from singing after all. It is closely related to science and technology. Comrade Li Fuchun repeatedly said in his report: I am a layman, and the opinions I express are only to elicit further comments, and I hope that everyone will express their opinions and discuss them, because you are the experts. Although some people say that Comrade Fuchun is not really a layman. More than 30 years ago, when he was studying and working in France, he was already an experienced lathe worker. But humility is a virtue at any time.
    At the meeting, more than 800 representatives unanimously agreed with the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily. The policy is clear, but specific scientific and technological issues still need to be gathered from all sources. This design conference also fully demonstrated this point. There were speeches at the plenary session and discussions in groups, with heated discussions on issues such as the size of construction, how to make urban planning better, whether to build more buildings or more bungalows, and the revision of various standards. Only in this way can we gather everyone's opinions, and after careful analysis and research, can we draw correct or more correct conclusions from different opinions.

    建设之路
    ——全国设计工作会议侧记
    本报记者　张沛、叶剑韵
    北京的6月，虽然是燕子衔将春色去的季节，然而花香鸟语，比之春景，并无逊色。就在这个时候，我们参加了国家建委、计委、经委等机关联合召开的全国第一次设计工作会议，会上，听到了代表们唱出的今后勤俭建国的建设之路的序曲。成绩是基本的
    会上代表们讨论了不少的问题。首先是对几年来的建设工作作了估价。
    估价是肯定的：成绩是基本的主要的，错误和缺点是次要的，有些还是难免的。
    有人说，共产党作报告做宣传，欢喜套用“成绩是基本的，偏差错误是个别的”。“连说七个好以后，再来一条缺点，合起来正好是条新八股。”
    有人说，这也是“教条主义”的表现。事情果然如此吗？回答是：否。有些人似乎忘记了这些尽人皆知的事实，或者存心不看这些事实。可是事实毕竟是不可战胜的。会议再一次展现了这些谁也无法抹杀的事实：
    我国的第一个五年计划已经取得了伟大的胜利，开始改变了我国的经济面貌。首先，是社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，人剥削人的制度已经基本上结束，这是一个伟大的有历史意义的成绩。其次，就是工农业生产有了很大的发展，1956年的工农业生产基本上已达到原定的1957年的指标，基本建设投资（包括1957年投资在内），预计可超额完成原定五年计划投资四百二十七亿四千万元的8％左右。许多我国从未有过的新工厂建设起来了，不能制造一辆汽车、一架飞机的时代过去了，带着“中国制”标徽的汽车和新式飞机出现了；国民党统治时期，钢的最高年产量只有九十多万吨，现在增加到四百多万吨；棉纱从两百多万件增加到四百多万件；从1950年到1957年（计划数字）粮食产量增加一千五百亿斤。工业占工农业总产值中的比重大大上升了，过去许多不会的东西，许多不懂的事物，现在在苏联同志帮助下初步学会了，而且开始自己动手设计一些复杂的工程了。
    这一切，难道不是成绩吗？难道讲了这些客观事实，就是“新八股”吗？肯定成绩，就是肯定我们国家的进步，肯定我国人民的进步，肯定全国劳动人民辛勤劳动的成果。否定一切，全国人民是不同意的。不知道为什么，有些人口头上也赞成社会主义，但他们却不喜欢社会主义建设的成绩。
    代表们在估价成绩的同时，也实事求是地批判了过去的缺点和错误。为了探索今后正确的建设道路，谈到的缺点和错误的分量是超过成绩的。但是我们必须肯定：“成绩是基本的、主要的。”这是会议上的共同的声音。
        中国的国情
    人们没有回避缺点。
    建设工作中的主要缺点是什么呢？这个问题是这次会议探索的主要内容之一。浪费了，多花了钱，也就是我们的某些建设，还不大符合我国的现状。有点像不满周岁的小孩，却戴了一顶大人的帽子。有些生活在深山荒野的地质队，森林采伐队，修上了三、四层的洋楼，而周围的农民，住的是茅棚、草房，相形之下，看的人有意见，住的人也不舒服。我们的国家，经过了三年的恢复和五年的经济文化建设，国民经济比八年前有了很大的发展。但是，我国仍然是一个经济文化比较落后的国家。我们是一个大国，但是一个穷国。说穷，就是经济技术上的落后。我国虽然每年生产有四百多万吨钢，近一亿二千万吨的煤，自己也能制造汽车、飞机，可是若以六亿人口来平均计算，产量就很少了。国家虽大，可耕的土地却很少，每人平均不到三亩耕地，四川省每人平均只有一亩八分。我国有六亿多人，每年还要增加一千三百万，这么多的人，每人多吃一斤米，多穿一尺布，就够欧洲的某些小国生产一年。国家贫穷，人口众多，耕地很少，这就是我们的国情。几年的建设工作，由于对我国的国情分析不够，因而，贪多、贪大、盲目追求高标准的做法就出现了。总的说来，这几年非生产性的建设搞的多了一些，标准也高了一些。五年中非生产建设（包括1957年）约有二亿平方公尺，投资约合一百二十亿元；第一个五年计划的基本建设投资总额是四百二十七亿四千万元，非生产建筑的投资就占了五年计划基本建设投资的百分之二十八。
    如果我们从中节省出一半六十亿元来修工厂的话，可以办和第一汽车厂同等规模的厂子十个以上。
    有无问题和高标准
    正由于我国还是一个穷国，我们的生产水平低下，人民的生活水平还不高，要改变贫穷落后的面貌，当务之急，就是要多盖工厂，多建矿山。这就是说首先要解决的是有无和多少的问题。既然我们有很多东西还没有，有的还很少，利用有限的资金进行建设，就必须贯彻勤俭建国的方针，我们需要的是工厂，但不是外表漂亮的工厂。
    过去，由于对我国的国情了解不深，对我国的国力估计不当，有许多措施，是不完全符合勤俭建国的精神的。
    西安有一个工厂，占地六十公顷，绿化用地四十公顷，厂区只用了十五公顷。这种对土地多征少用，早征迟用，征而不用的情况，是相当多的。据统计，几年来为建筑征用的土地达二千万亩，至今，全国开垦的荒地也不过七千五百万亩；而且征用的土地多是好地，在西安地区征用的是八百里秦川的米粮地，每亩平均年产粮食均在四百斤以上。在四川成都盆地征用的土地，每亩年产量均在一千二百斤以上。如果能节约用地四分之一的话，就是五百万亩；若以每亩平均年产量五百斤计算，就可以增加二十五亿斤粮食。这一笔粮食，可供七百万人吃一年。
    此外在建筑标准方面也有偏高的现象。有的卫生标准过高，有的防洪防火防震等标准不切实际。
    在采用技术装备的水平方面，盲目追求现代化的思想是存在的。如裕溪口港采用大型装煤机、高架铁路和煤坑道的设备全部机械化。而南京三民码头是采用移动式皮带输送机，这种装煤的设备，作业时虽然需要较多的人工配合，效率却和裕溪口全盘机械化相差不多，而投资却比裕溪口节省了好几倍。我国人多，工具少，有许多设备自己还不能制造，或不能大量制造，需要向国外订购；在我国工业不强，技术水平不高，财力有限劳动力多的情况下，考虑采用适当的技术设备，不仅可以节省外汇，而且也可以使我国更多的人得到就业的机会。公共福利建筑也有标准过高的现象。对“国穷”“人多”“地少”的国情认识不够，某些建设的标准过高，主要怪谁呢？薄一波同志说得很清楚：过去我担任建委主任，“暂行标准”是建委颁布的，因此缺点主要在建委，是我们领导上有主观主义，而不能单怪设计人员。薄一波同志以实事求是的整风的精神向大会作了一个生动的报告。可是从许多发言也证实：有些缺点，也确实是因为没有经验，是“难免”的。虽然现在有人不喜欢听“难免”这两个字。
    设计工作会议，是编制第二个五年计划的重要步骤，它将动员全国十万设计人员，为我国的社会主义建设继续前进。大、中、小相结合
    关于企业建设的规模问题，也是这次会议讨论的中心之一。
    为了提高我国的工业水平和技术水平，奠定国家工业化的基础，建设一批近代化的大企业是必需的，是应当肯定的。过去这样做了，今后还要这样做。但是，根据我国的历史条件和实际情况，大企业不能搞得太多，在建设大企业的同时，还应该更多地建设中小型企业，使得中小企业和大企业结合起来。这就是大、中、小相结合的方针。
    事实证明，建设中、小企业，从目前我们的实际情况来看，是有不少好处的。首先，多搞中、小企业，技术设备容易解决。同时也便于发挥国内的设计力量和机械制造力量。其次，中、小企业建设时间短，投资可以少些，生产收效快。这样既能尽快地满足国家和人民的需要，也能迅速积累资金。再次，多搞中、小企业，可以多布置一些工业点，使生产力的分布更合理一些，使地区间的经济发展可以逐步平衡。还有，多搞中、小企业，可使产品多样化，满足各方面的需要。
    大、中、小相结合，就是使最新技术、一般技术、手工劳动相结合，也就是使国家经营的、地方经营的、手工业、农业相结合。如果只注意最新技术，就可能把一般技术和手工业挤掉。四川修了三个大纸浆厂，建成后年产十五万吨纸浆，需用三十万吨竹子。但是四川全省只产五十万吨竹子，居民盖房子制家具也要用竹子，当地手工业的土纸，也是用竹子作原料，如果满足这三个纸厂的需要，就会把手工业挤掉。而手工业很大一部分是农村副业，挤掉手工业，必然会影响农村副业收入。我国有五亿以上的人口住在农村，城市人口约九千二百万。如果对绝大多数人的生产和生活问题考虑欠周的话，是极不妥当的。而大、中、小相结合的方针，又是和在积极发展农业的基础上更好地贯彻优先发展重工业的方针紧密相联的。这不仅可以使工业获得原料解决市场，而且也可以照顾农业和手工业，使他们得到发展，使人民增加收入。
        在难易之间
    少花钱，多办事，并不是一件复杂得不可理解的事情。可是，这也不是一件简单得一想就通的事情。要使我们的建设工作，在政治上是正确的，在经济上是合理的，在技术上是先进的和一般的、手工的相结合的；又要使现在和将来相结合，应该说这是一件更加复杂、更加困难的事。这不是减轻了建设工作人员的责任，不是把设计工作简化了，而是更加加重了他们的责任，加重了他们的工作任务。所以这样说，这不仅是由于技术上的原因，更重要的，是在于思想上要进行一次大的调整。这就是要所有的建设工作者深切地了解：我们是在一个贫穷落后的国家中修工厂、开矿山、筑铁路、架桥梁。
    我国是一个大国，做起事情来有有利条件也有困难。今年我国的整个基本建设投资是一百十一亿元。这个数字按全国六亿多人口平均，每人还不到十八元。困难的是，如果今年我们每个人多消费了十八元，那么整个基本建设投资就没有了。有利的是，如果我们每个人能节省五元钱的话，集中起来就是三十一亿元，可以修建六个和新安江一般大小的水电站。
    人们歌唱瑰丽的社会主义建设，可是建设毕竟不同于歌唱。它和科学技术息息相连。李富春同志在报告中一再说：我是外行，我讲的意见仅是抛砖引玉，希望你们大家发表意见，大家讨论。因为你们是专家。虽然有人说，富春同志并不是真外行，三十多年前他在法国勤工俭学的时候，就已是一个内行的车床工人。可是谦虚在任何时候都是美德啊。
    会上，八百多个代表，一致同意勤俭建国的方针。方针明确了，可是具体的科学技术问题，还要集思广益。这次设计会议也充分表现了这一点。大会发言，小组讨论，对建设规模的大小，城市规划如何好，多建楼房还是多建平房，各种标准的修订等等问题，都展开了热烈的讨论。只有这样，把大家的意见集中起来，经过仔细的分析研究，才能从不同的意见中得出正确的或者比较正确的结论。
