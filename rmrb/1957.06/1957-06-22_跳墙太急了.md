    Jumping Over the Wall Too Hastily
    Xia Zhifeng
    Mr. Zhang Naiqi is scaring people again:
    "There are actually people organizing encirclement and suppression on ideological issues."
    Only release, never retract – this is the Party's unwavering policy. The Chinese Communist Party is determined to carry the rectification movement through to the end and correct the shortcomings and errors in its work. However, it and the broad masses of people under its leadership must also fully exercise their right to freedom of speech. This cannot be defeated by any means of intimidation.
    "Criticizing others' criticisms based on facts and starting from the desire for unity is also completely acceptable and normal." These words came from your own mouth, and they are still ringing in our ears. Why have they suddenly become "encirclement and suppression"?
    Jumping over the wall too hastily always looks rather undignified.

    跳墙太急了
  　夏之风
    章乃器先生又在吓人了：
    “居然还有人对思想问题组织围剿”。
    只放不收，这是党的坚定不移的方针。中国共产党有决心把整风运动贯彻到底、改正自己工作中的缺点和错误，但是，它和在它领导下的广大人民也要充分行使自己言论自由的权利，这不是用任何恐吓手段所能击退的。
    “也是根据事实，也是从团结的愿望出发，对别人的批评进行反批评，也是完全可以的，是正常的”。此言此语出于你自己之口，言犹在耳，为什么又变成“围剿”了呢？
    跳墙跳得太急，样子总是不会怎么太雅观的。
