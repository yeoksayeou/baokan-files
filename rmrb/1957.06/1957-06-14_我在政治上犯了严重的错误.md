　　I Made a Serious Political Mistake
　　Zhang Bojun
    On May 22nd, at the forum convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for democratic parties and non-party人士 to help the Communist Party rectify its work style, my speech contained serious ideological errors. People from all sides have already offered stern criticisms, among which the most erroneous were the issues of the so-called "political design institute" and the "finished products" of the State Council meetings, as well as the issue of language reform. This shows that my position is unstable, my understanding is vague, and I have treated the country's policies with an extremely unserious and liberal attitude, resulting in adverse political effects and being exploited by right-wing elements. My preliminary self-examination reveals that this is due to my insufficient study over the past few years, and my bourgeois ideology has not been transformed. Consequently, my thinking has failed to keep up with the development of the new situation in the country, leading to this mistake. I have let down the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's teachings and trust in me over the years, and I deeply feel ashamed.
    Now, after the criticism from people from all walks of life across the country, I am greatly shocked. I should wake up as soon as possible, correct my mistakes, and express my heartfelt gratitude to the comrades who have helped me. I should accept this major lesson, strengthen my studies, transform my thinking, and continue to deeply examine the roots of my erroneous thinking.

　　我在政治上犯了严重的错误
　　章伯钧
    5月22日，我在中国共产党中央统战部召集的各民主党派和无党派人士帮助共产党整风座谈会上的发言，思想上犯了严重的错误，各方人士已经提出严正的批评，其中最错误的，就是所谓“政治设计院”和国务院开会的“成品”问题以及文字改革问题。这说明了我的立场不稳，认识模糊，以十分不严肃的自由主义态度，对待国家的政策，以致造成政治上的不良影响，为右派分子所利用。我初步检查结果，认为这是由于我几年来学习不够，我的资产阶级思想意识没有得到改造，因而思想跟不上国家新形势的发展，以致犯此错误。我辜负了共产党和毛主席几年来对于我的教导和信任，我深觉惭悔。
    现在经过全国各界人士对我的批评，使我大吃一惊，我应该及早觉悟，纠正错误，并对帮助过我的同志们表示衷心的感谢。我应该接受这次重大的教训，加强学习，改造思想，并继续深入地检查我错误思想的根源。
