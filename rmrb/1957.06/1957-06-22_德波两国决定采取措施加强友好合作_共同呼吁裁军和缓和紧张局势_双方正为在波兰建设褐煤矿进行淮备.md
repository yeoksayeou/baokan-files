　　Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the talks between the delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic have successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 20th, and a joint statement of the two governments was signed in the conference hall of the Council of Ministers in Berlin. The joint statement of the two governments was signed by Democratic German Prime Minister Grotewohl and Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz.
    On the same evening, the Polish delegation held a banquet to entertain the Democratic German delegation and people from all walks of life in Berlin. After the banquet, Ulbricht and Gomulka signed the joint declaration of the two parties on behalf of the Central Committees of the German Socialist Unity Party and the Polish United Workers' Party, respectively.
    The joint statement of the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic stated that during the visit of the Polish party and government delegation led by Gomulka and Cyrankiewicz to the Democratic German Republic from June 18th to 20th, friendly talks were held with the Democratic German party and government delegation led by Ulbricht and Grotewohl. During the talks, the two sides conducted extensive exchanges of views on further developing friendly cooperation between the Democratic German Republic and Poland and on international issues related to the interests of both countries.
    The joint statement said: The common goals of the two countries in building socialism and consolidating peace are the solid foundation of the two countries' relations, which are formed in accordance with the principles of friendship and fraternal cooperation. Both sides are convinced that the Oder-Neisse border between the two countries is one of the important factors guaranteeing peace and security in Europe.
    Both sides believe that the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, China, Poland, the Democratic German Republic, and other socialist countries, as well as countries such as India, have recently led to the relaxation of international tensions. A peaceful solution to all international disputes is possible. The two governments advocate the conclusion of international agreements prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and reducing conventional armed forces and armaments; and the realization of the Soviet government's proposal to cease nuclear weapons tests and reach an agreement to renounce the use of atomic bombs is the first step towards completely banning such weapons. The two governments also support partial solutions that can promote future universal disarmament. They favor the establishment of a European military sparse zone including the two Germanys and their neighboring countries.
    Both sides accused West German revanchists of attempting to violate the Oder-Neisse border, pointed out that West German militarism is the common enemy of the German and Polish people, and welcomed the growth of forces in West Germany against revenge and atomic expansion policies.
    Both sides stated that they are prepared to continue to strengthen their defense alliance with the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact before the realization of a European collective security treaty. And will take steps to strive to reach an understanding with other countries in the Baltic Sea region.
    Both sides unanimously stated that consolidating the unity of the socialist camp is the foundation for realizing the two countries' peaceful policies and socialist construction.
    The two governments firmly oppose the division of Europe and Germany and support the Soviet proposal to establish an all-European economic cooperation and peaceful use of atomic energy system.
    Poland reiterated that the peace-loving German Democratic Republic is of great significance to the peace and security of Germany and Europe. Both sides unanimously believe that the peaceful reunification of Germany is a matter for the German people themselves. The reunification of Germany can be achieved through understanding between the two Germanys.
    The two governments noted with satisfaction that the relations between the two countries are developing under mutually beneficial conditions. The close and friendly cooperation between the two countries is particularly manifested in the cooperation agreement concluded on April 17 this year on the construction of a new brown coal mine in Poland and the 1957 trade agreement. The statement pointed out that within this year, the two countries will also conclude a series of treaties and agreements that will help strengthen the relations between the two countries.
    The statement concluded by saying that both sides expressed their conviction that the visit of the Polish party and government delegation to the German Democratic Republic will help further strengthen the fraternal and friendly relations between the two countries and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp.
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 21st: According to the Polish News Agency, Poland and the Democratic German Republic are making intensive preparations for the construction of a large-scale brown coal joint enterprise in Turoszów, Lower Silesia, Poland. Engineers from the Democratic German Republic have already drafted a plan for expanding an existing brown coal mine in this area and constructing a new large-scale open-pit brown coal mine. Construction will begin at the beginning of next year.
    According to the cooperation agreement signed between Poland and the Democratic German Republic in April this year, the Democratic German Republic will provide a long-term investment loan of 400 million rubles for the construction of an open-pit brown coal mine in Poland, and almost all of the equipment for these coal mines will be supplied by the Democratic German Republic. The first batch of machines has now been shipped to Poland.
    It is estimated that the Turoszów brown coal mine has reserves of approximately one billion tons. It is expected that by 1965, the new and old open-pit brown coal mines will produce more than 25 million tons of brown coal annually. From 1960, Poland will supply the Democratic German Republic with approximately 6 million tons of brown coal annually, and the remaining brown coal will be used for Poland's chemical industry and the largest power station in Poland, which will be established in Turoszów.

　　德波两国决定采取措施加强友好合作
    共同呼吁裁军和缓和紧张局势
    双方正为在波兰建设褐煤矿进行淮备
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国两国党和政府代表团的会谈已经在20日下午圆满结束，并且在柏林的部长会议会议厅签署了两国政府的联合声明。在两国政府的联合声明上签字的是民主德国总理格罗提渥和波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹。
    同一天晚上，波兰代表团举行宴会，招待民主德国代表团和柏林各界人士。宴会以后，乌布利希和哥穆尔卡分别代表德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党中央委员会在两党的联合宣言上签了字。
    德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国两国政府的联合声明说：以哥穆尔卡和西伦凯维兹为首的波兰党和政府代表团在6月18日到20日访问民主德国期间，同以乌布利希和格罗提渥为首的民主德国党和政府代表团举行了友好的会谈。在会谈中，双方就进一步发展民主德国和波兰之间的友好合作以及同两国利益有关的国际问题进行了广泛的意见交换。
    联合声明说：两国在建设社会主义和巩固和平事业中的共同目标，是依照友好和兄弟合作的原则而形成的两国关系的牢固基础。双方确信，两国的奥得—尼斯河疆界是保证欧洲和平和安全的重要因素之一。
    双方认为：苏联、中国、波兰、民主德国和其他社会主义国家以及印度等国家的不懈努力，在最近期间导致了国际紧张局势的缓和。和平解决一切国际争执问题是可能的。两国政府主张缔结禁止大规模毁灭性武器的国际协定和裁减常规武装部队和军备；而实现苏联政府关于停止核武器试验的建议以及达成一项放弃使用原子弹的协议，是导致完全禁止这类武器的第一步。两国政府也支持能够促进将来的普遍裁军的局部解决办法。它们赞成建立包括两个德国及其邻国在内的欧洲军事稀疏区。
    双方指责西德复仇主义分子企图侵犯奥得—尼斯河疆界，指出西德军国主义是德波两国人民的共同敌人，并且对西德反对复仇和原子扩军政策的力量的增长表示欢迎。
    双方声明，准备在欧洲集体安全条约实现以前，继续加强它们同苏联以及华沙条约其他成员国的防卫联盟。并且将采取步骤，竭力谋求同波罗的海其他国家达成谅解。
    双方一致表示，巩固社会主义阵营的团结是实现两国的和平政策和社会主义建设的基础。
    两国政府坚决反对欧洲和德国的分裂，而支持苏联关于建立全欧经济合作和和平利用原子能体系的建议。
    波兰重申，爱好和平的德意志民主共和国对德国和欧洲的和平和安全具有非常重大的意义。双方一致认为，德国的和平统一是德国人民自己的事情。德国的统一能够在两个德国谅解的途径上实现。
    两国政府满意地指出，两国关系正在互利的条件下发展着。两国的紧密友好合作特别表现在今年4月17日缔结的关于在波兰建设新褐煤矿的合作协定和1957年的贸易协定中。声明指出，在今年内，两国还将缔结一系列有助于加强两国的关系的条约和协定。
    声明最后说，双方表示确信波兰党和政府代表团访问德意志民主共和国有助于进一步加强两国兄弟友好关系和加强社会主义阵营的团结。
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰和民主德国正为在波兰下西里西亚的图罗朔夫建设一个大型褐煤联合企业进行紧张的准备工作。民主德国的工程师们已经为扩充这个地方原有的一个褐煤矿和建设一个新的大型露天褐煤矿草拟好了计划草案。建设工程将在明年年初开始。
    根据波兰和民主德国今年4月间签订的合作协定，民主德国将为在波兰建设露天褐煤矿提供四亿卢布的长期投资贷款，这些煤矿的设备几乎全部由民主德国供应。现在，第一批机器已经运到波兰。
    据估计，图罗朔夫的褐煤矿藏约有十亿吨。预料到1965年，新旧两个露天褐煤矿将年产二千五百多万吨褐煤。从1960年起，波兰每年将供应民主德国约六百万吨褐煤，其余的褐煤将用于波兰的化学工业和将在图罗朔夫建立的波兰最大的电力站。
