How to Help the Party Rectify its Work
Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ma Xulun

I have been bedridden for many days. Although I have not had much contact with actual political life, I am excited every day when I read the newspapers and see people from all walks of life speaking out freely and enthusiastically to help the Party carry out its rectification campaign. The great Chinese Communist Party, as the core of leadership of our country, has led the people of the whole country to make unprecedented achievements for the country in the past few years. This is obvious to all. However, the Party is still so modest, so strict in demanding its members, and sincerely and earnestly hopes that the people of the whole country, including all democratic parties, will offer criticisms and opinions to the members in order to correct the shortcomings of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and correctly handle the problems of internal contradictions among the people. Such a great rectification movement, which dares to demand improvement of shortcomings and errors and is truly for the country and the people, is unprecedented in our country's history. Without the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, this would be unimaginable.

The interests of the Party and the interests of our people are completely一致的. The purpose of our democratic parties helping the Party to rectify its work is entirely to expand socialist democracy, eliminate the "three evils," and further consolidate the core leading role of the Communist Party, so as to better build our socialist cause. Any attempt to deviate from socialism and use the rectification movement to carry out vicious slander and weaken the Party's leadership role is incompatible with the interests of the people of the whole country.

I cannot but indignantly point out that a small number of people with ulterior motives are "taking advantage of loopholes" in an attempt to use the rectification movement to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. The fact that Lu Yuwen, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, was threatened by an anonymous letter for publishing legitimate remarks on safeguarding the Party's leadership is a vivid example. This anonymous letter incident shows that some people with ulterior motives are trying to undermine the rectification movement and trying to pull China's history backward. This is not only a challenge to the Party's leadership and a challenge to socialism, but also a challenge to the people of the whole country. This kind of challenge has gone beyond the scope of contradictions among the people and cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the people of the whole country!

Our China Association for Promoting Democracy has grown and developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We have shared weal and woe with the Party and followed the Party in advancing from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. Our goal is consistent with the goal of the Party and the goal of the people of the whole country. We will unite more closely around the Party. Precisely because of this, we must represent the legitimate demands and interests of our members and the masses we are connected with, and constantly and unreservedly make suggestions and criticisms to the Party, and be the Party's friends who dare to admonish. In the Party's rectification movement, I call on all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy to continue to implement the spirit of "thorough airing of views," resolutely and boldly expose the "three evils," and help the Party successfully complete the major task of "rectification." However, we must also distinguish right from wrong and strictly draw a line between "opposing the three evils" and opposing the Party and socialism. Drawing a line on this fundamental issue is precisely for the purpose of better implementing "airing of views," more thoroughly exposing the "three evils," more favorably handling and resolving contradictions among the people, and further consolidating the Party's leadership. We must raise our vigilance and criticize and struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons. We must also realize that earnestly helping the Party to do a good job in rectification is also a process of our own transformation and improvement.

    怎样帮助党整风？
    中国民主促进会主席　马叙伦
    我卧病多日，虽对实际政治生活接触不多，但每天读报看到各界人士大放大鸣，帮助党进行整风的热烈情况，我的心情是兴奋的。作为我们国家领导核心的伟大的中国共产党，几年以来领导全国人民替国家做出了史无前例的成绩，这是有目共睹的。但是党仍然是那样的谦虚，那样严格地要求自己的党员，诚恳而严肃的希望全国人民包括各民主党派给党员提批评和意见，以便纠正官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的毛病，正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，这样勇于要求改进缺点和错误的、真正为国为民的伟大的整风运动，为我国历史上从来所未有，没有中国共产党的正确领导，这是不能想像的。
    党的利益和我们全国人民的利益是完全一致的。我们民主党派帮助党整风的目的完全是为了扩大社会主义民主，消除“三害”，进一步巩固共产党的领导核心作用，从而更好地建设我们的社会主义事业。任何离开社会主义，利用整风运动来进行恶毒诽谤、削弱党的领导作用的企图都是同全国人民的利益不相容的。
    我不能不愤慨地指出少数别有用心的分子正在“钻空子”，企图利用整风运动来进行反党、反社会主义的勾当。民革中央委员卢郁文由于发表了关于维护党的领导的正当言论，竟遭到匿名信的恫吓，就是一个活生生的例子。这一匿名信事件表明某些别有用心的分子企图破坏整风运动，企图把中国的历史拉向倒退。这不但是向党的领导挑战，向社会主义挑战，而且也是向我们全国人民挑战。这种挑战行为已越出人民内部矛盾的范围，不能不引起我们全国人民的严重警惕！
    我们中国民主促进会是在中国共产党的领导之下成长、发展起来的。我们曾经与党共患难，出生死，从民主革命和社会主义革命中一直跟着党前进。我们的目标，同党的目标、全国人民的目标是一致的。我们将更加紧密地团结在党的周围。正惟如此，我们必须代表我们成员和所联系群众的正当要求和利益，经常地、无保留地向党提出建议和批评，做党的诤友。在党的整风运动中，我号召全体民进会员要继续贯彻“彻底鸣放”的精神，坚决地、大胆地揭露“三害”，帮助党胜利完成“整风”大事。但是我们也必须明辨是非，严格划清“反对三害”和反党、反社会主义的界线。划清在这个根本问题上的界线，也正是为了更好地贯彻“鸣”、“放”，更彻底地揭露“三害”，更有利地处理、解决人民内部的矛盾，更进一步地巩固党的领导。我们必须提高警惕，对一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神的言行进行批判和斗争。我们还必须认识认真帮助党搞好整风，同时也是我们自己进行改造和提高的过程。
