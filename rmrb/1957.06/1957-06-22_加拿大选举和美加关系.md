　　Canadian Election and US-Canada Relations
　　Ji Long
    The results of this year's Canadian parliamentary election showed a major defeat for the Liberal Party, which had been in power for twenty-two years, losing its position as the largest party in parliament. The Progressive Conservative Party gained the leading position in parliament. The election results reflect some changes in US-Canada relations. In recent years, the victorious Progressive Conservative Party has, to some extent, reflected the anti-American sentiment of those Canadian capitalists who feel the pressure and squeezing of American capital. The current party leader, Diefenbaker, in a speech at the beginning of his campaign, accused: "The path of the Liberal government in recent years will...place future generations at risk of losing national independence." The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, which has increased its seats in this election, has also openly advocated opposition to American control and striving for Canada's independence and autonomy in recent years. Therefore, although foreign policy was not the central slogan in this election, the current US-Canada relations and the aversion of all levels of Canadian society to this relationship undoubtedly had a considerable impact on this election. American news agencies reported after the start of the campaign that "a wave of nationalism is rising in Canada." After the election results were announced, the "New York Times" also acknowledged that the failure of the Canadian Liberal Party in the election indicated a "hidden anti-American sentiment" in Canada.
    What are some of the problems in US-Canada relations?
    The incident in March and April this year in which the American authorities used political persecution to force the death of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt Herbert Norman highlighted the current US-Canada relations. The Norman suicide case aroused widespread indignation in Canada. The "Daily Mirror" believes that the Norman incident caused the ruling Liberal Party to lose a large number of votes, which is well-founded.
    The Norman incident was an American intervention in Canada outside of Canada's borders. Within Canada, the attitude of the American authorities is no more restrained. For example, in April 1956, the American Ambassador to Canada, Stuart, actually delivered a speech in Vancouver, Canada, publicly attacking those who criticized the United States. This blatant interference in Canada's internal affairs once aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Canadian people, and the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs had to bring it to the attention of the U.S. State Department. The radar stations built by the United States in Canada have become places where Canadian sovereignty cannot reach. Senior Canadian ministerial officials must obtain the approval of the U.S. Department of Defense and be subject to loyalty reviews by the U.S. Department of Defense if they want to visit these radar stations. These examples illustrate how the US government disregards Canadian sovereignty in US-Canada relations.
    In economic terms, the arrogant and domineering attitude of the United States and the increasingly significant unequal relationship between the United States and Canada are too numerous to mention.
    The long-term dispute between the United States and Canada over the St. Lawrence River fully reflects the "cooperation" policy adopted by the United States, which only cares about the profits of American monopoly capital and does not consider the interests of Canada. The deepening of the St. Lawrence River channel and the construction of canals have been the desire of the Canadian people for decades, but the American side has delayed the implementation of the 1910 construction agreement between the two countries for decades for the benefit of certain American consortia. When the United States finally agreed to construct and began to use these waterways on a large scale in recent years due to the increasing need for resources in eastern Canada, it insisted on placing one end of the canal under American control, while opposing Canada's construction of locks within Canada, attempting to control the entire shipping system in the United States. On the other hand, it used government subsidies for American ships to effectively exclude the use of the waterway by ships from other countries, thereby monopolizing the shipping system and making Canada subordinate to the interests of American monopoly capital. Regarding another river between the United States and Canada, the Columbia River, the United States adopted the same policy, consistently obstructing Canada's construction of hydropower generation within Canada (in the upper reaches of the river).
    There are similar situations in trade between the United States and Canada. A large number of American industrial products are imported into Canada. In 1956, the United States accounted for about 73% of Canada's total imports. However, the United States uses high tariffs, import quotas, and other methods to restrict Canadian exports to the United States. Not only that, but the United States also used government subsidies to dump cotton textiles to Canada, so that the Canadian government had to announce the implementation of anti-dumping laws to resist. The United States not only prevents the import of Canadian products, but also uses its dominant position in the international market to promote agricultural products in large quantities, effectively squeezing out Canadian agricultural exports and causing serious damage to the Canadian economy. In early 1956, the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce sadly said: "What the United States is doing is undermining certain Canadian overseas markets." The "New York Times" pointed out that the United States' dumping of wheat in the world market was also one of the reasons for the Liberal Party's defeat in the election.
    In the United States and Canada, many people also emphasize the role of the large increase in American investment in Canada after World War II in promoting Canada's economic development after the war. However, this is only one side of the situation. At present, more and more Canadians are increasingly seeing the other side, realizing that the accelerated economic expansion of the United States is a serious threat to Canada's independent development. American investment in Canada is currently increasing by about 700 million yuan per year. In 1945, American investment in Canada was about 4.9 billion yuan. According to current estimates, it has reached 13 billion yuan, showing how rapid the increase is. According to estimates in 1953, more than half of the capital of many important Canadian industries such as petroleum, mining and smelting, chemicals, electrical appliance manufacturing, automobiles, and rubber are under the control of American capital. These American-controlled industries are actually just branches of American monopoly capital in Canada, and everything is subject to the orders of American bosses.
    A Canadian author pointed out in the March issue of the American "Atlantic" magazine this year that what makes the trade between the United States and Canada in a relationship that violates the principles of equality and mutual benefit is mainly the policies of the American monopoly capital that controls Canadian industry. The policy of American monopoly capital is very obvious: on the one hand, it maintains Canada as a market that provides cheap raw materials and labor to the United States, and on the other hand, Canadian products cannot enter the American domestic market to compete, but can only be exported to other regions, especially the sterling area. As a result, Canada imports a large number of manufactured and semi-finished products from the United States every year, and can only export raw materials and semi-finished products to the United States. Therefore, there is a huge trade deficit with the United States every year. In 1956, this deficit reached 1.398 billion US dollars. Even if the surplus in Canada's trade with other countries is fully used to offset it, it is far from enough. If the Canadian economy develops according to the current situation, the import of American semi-finished and manufactured products will continue to increase, but the American domestic market will not be further opened to Canada. Therefore, Canada's trade deficit with the United States will continue to increase. Many Canadian people have already realized with alarm that the current reliance on the large influx of American capital every year has helped the balance of international payments, but once the inflow of American capital stops or decreases sharply, and the existing investment begins to remit profits back to the United States, stopping the current continued reinvestment, Canada's foreign exchange situation will immediately fall into a serious crisis.
    In addition to the above-mentioned restrictions and exclusion of Canada by the United States, Canada is also subject to the "embargo" imposed by the United States. Not only that, but the Canadian people generally advocate international peaceful coexistence and the development of trade and cultural exchanges between countries, because they clearly recognize that this is in line with Canada's interests. However, the American ruling clique is dragging Canada to implement a "position of strength" policy and conducting a "cold war." Under this policy of the United States, American monopoly capital has increased huge profits, but Canada has become a victim of this policy. A Progressive Conservative Party parliamentary candidate in this election sharply pointed out that due to the government's foreign policy of dependence on the United States, Canada "has experienced many years of pain and shame." This is the contradiction in the current US-Canada relations.
    Now Liberal Party Prime Minister St. Laurent has resigned, and Conservative Party leader Diefenbaker has accepted the appointment to form a new government. As for the new government's domestic and foreign policies, it remains to be seen how things will progress. However, one thing is very clear: the Canadian people, including a considerable part of the bourgeoisie, are increasingly obviously and firmly demanding Canada's independent development, and are increasingly unwilling to continue to tolerate the current US-Canada relations that hinder Canada's independent development. This trend can be fully seen from the results of this election. The Associated Press once described the Canadian people's legitimate desire for independent development as "uniquely Canadian sentiment," which reflects the colonialist view of the American ruling clique that has always disregarded the interests of the Canadian people. This also shows that the Canadian people must continue to struggle on their path of independent development.

　　加拿大选举和美加关系
　　纪隆
    今年加拿大议会选举的结果，执政二十二年的自由党遭到巨大的失败，丧失了在议会中的第一大党的地位。进步保守党取得了议会中的领导地位。这次选举结果反映了美加关系上的一些变化。获胜的进步保守党近年来在一定程度上反映了那些感觉到美国资本的压力和排挤的加拿大资本家的反美情绪。现在的党的领袖迪芬贝克在开始竞选的一次演说中曾经指责：“近年来自由党政府的道路将要……置未来的世世代代子孙于可能丧失民族独立的危险之前”。在这次选举中增加了议席的合作联盟近年来也是公开主张反对美国控制、争取加拿大的独立自主的。因此，虽然对外政策不是这次选举中的中心口号，但是当前的美加关系和加拿大各阶层对于这种关系的反感无疑地对于这次选举起了相当的影响。美国通讯社在竞选开始后曾经报道说，“加拿大国内正在掀起民族主义的浪潮”。选举结果公布以后，“纽约时报”也承认加拿大自由党在选举中的失败表明加拿大存在一种“隐蔽的反美情绪”。
    在美加关系上，存在着一些什么问题呢。
    今年3、4月间发生的美国当局用政治迫害逼死加拿大驻埃及大使赫伯特·诺曼的事件突出地说明了当前的美加关系。诺曼被迫自杀这一事件在加拿大激起了广泛的愤慨。“每日镜报”认为诺曼事件使执政的自由党丧失了大量选票，是有一定的根据的。
    诺曼事件是美国在加拿大境外对加拿大的干预。在加拿大境内，美国官方的态度也没有比较检点些。例如，1956年4月，美国驻加拿大大使斯徒阿特竟然在加拿大的温哥华发表演说，对那些批评美国的人进行公开的攻击。这种公然干涉加拿大内政的行为曾经引起加拿大人民的强烈不满，加拿大外交部长曾经不得不提请美国国务院予以注意。美国在加拿大境内建造的雷达站已经成为加拿大的主权所不能达到的地方，加拿大的部长级高级官员如果要参观这些雷达站也必须获得美国国防部的批准，并受美国国防部的忠诚审查。这些事例说明，在美加关系上美国政府是如何蔑视加拿大的主权。
    在经济方面，美国的傲慢、专横的态度，和美加之间日益显著的不平等关系，更是不胜枚举。
    美加之间关于圣劳伦斯河的长期争执充分反映了美国所采取的“合作”政策只顾美国垄断资本的利润而不考虑加拿大的利益。圣劳伦斯河河道的加深和运河的修筑是加拿大人民几十年来的愿望，但是美国方面为了某些美国财团的利益，把1910年两国的修建协议的实施拖延了几十年。当美国近年来由于对加拿大东部资源的需要日益增加而终于同意修建并且开始大规模使用这些航道时，它一方面坚持要把运河的一端置于美国控制之下，同时反对加拿大在加拿大境内建筑水闸，企图把整个航运系统控制在美国手里；另一方面利用对美国船只实行津贴的办法实际排斥其它国家船只对航道的使用，从而垄断这一航运系统，使加拿大只能是从属于美国垄断资本的利益。关于美加之间的另一条河——哥伦比亚河，——美国采取同样的政策，始终阻挠加拿大在加拿大境内（河流的上流）进行水力发电的修建。
    美加之间的贸易也有类似的情况。美国的工业品大量输入到加拿大，1956年在加拿大全部进口总额中，美国约占73％。但是，美国却用高关税、进口限额等办法限制加拿大对美国的输出。不但如此，美国还用政府津贴办法向加拿大倾销棉织品，以致加拿大政府不得不宣布实行反倾销法加以抵制。美国不但防止加拿大产品的输入，它还在国际市场上利用它的优势地位大量推销农产品，实际上排挤着加拿大农产品的输出，对加拿大的经济造成很严重的影响。1956年初加拿大贸易与商业部长曾经沉痛地说：“美国正在做的是在瓦解某些加拿大的海外市场”。“纽约时报”指出，美国在世界市场倾销小麦，也是造成自由党竞选失败的原因之一。
    在美国和加拿大也有不少人强调在第二次大战后美国在加投资的大量增加，对于战后加拿大经济发展的促进作用。但是，这只是情况的一面。目前，越来越多的加拿大人正在日益看出另外的一面，发觉美国在加紧经济扩张是对于加拿大独立发展的严重威胁。美国在加投资现在每年约增加七亿元。1945年美在加投资约为四十九亿元，据现在的估计已达一百三十亿元，可见增加之快。根据1953年的估计，加拿大的许多重要工业如石油、采矿冶炼、化学、电气用具制造、汽车、橡胶等的资本半数以上均在美国资本的控制之下。这些美资控制的工业实际上只是美国垄断资本在加拿大的分支企业，一切都听命于美国老板。
    一位加拿大作者在今年3月号的美国“大西洋”杂志中指出，使得美加之间贸易处在违反平等互利原则的关系上的，主要的是那些控制着加拿大工业的美国垄断资本的政策。美国垄断资本的政策是很明显的，一方面保持加拿大作为对美国供给了廉价的原料和劳动力的市场，一方面加拿大的产品不能进入美国国内市场竞争而只能向其它地区、特别是英镑区输出。其结果是加拿大每年从美国进口大量的制成品和半制成品，而只能向美国输出原料和半制成品，因此每年对美有巨额的贸易逆差——入超。1956年这一逆差达十三亿九千八百万美元。即使以加拿大同其它国家贸易的顺差全部来抵补也远远不够。加拿大经济如果按照目前的情况发展下去，美国半制品和制成品的输入还要继续增加，而美国国内市场对加拿大是不会进一步开放的，因而加拿大对美贸易的逆差势将继续增加。许多加拿大人士已经警觉地指出，目前依靠每年美国资本的大量输入帮助了国际收支的平衡，但是一旦美国资本输入停止或大量减少，已有的投资又开始把利润汇回美国，停止目前的继续再投资，加拿大的外汇情况将立即陷入严重的危机。
    除了上述的美国对加拿大的限制和排挤之外，加拿大还受着美国所强加于人的“禁运”的限制。不仅如此。加拿大人民普遍地主张国际和平共处，发展各国之间的贸易往来、文化交流，因为他们明确认识到这是符合于加拿大的利益的。但是美国统治集团却拖着加拿大推行“实力地位”政策，进行“冷战”。在美国这个政策之下，美国的垄断资本增加了巨额的利润，加拿大却成为这个政策的牺牲。加拿大进步保守党的一位议员候选人在这次竞选中尖锐指出，由于政府依附美国的外交政策，加拿大“经历了许多年的痛苦和耻辱”。这就是当前美加关系中的矛盾所在。
    现在自由党总理圣劳伦已经辞职，保守党领袖迪芬贝克接受任命组织新政府，至于新政府的对内对外政策怎样，还要看事实的进展。但是，有一点是十分明显的：加拿大人民，包括相当大的一部分资产阶级在内，日益明显而且坚决地要求加拿大的独立发展，日益强烈地不愿继续容忍妨碍加拿大独立发展的当前的美加关系。从这次选举的结果可以充分看出这个动向。美联社曾经把加拿大人民要求独立发展的正当愿望说成是“唯加拿大的情绪”，这正反映出美国统治集团一贯无视加拿大人民利益的殖民主义的观点。这也说明，加拿大人民在他们的独立发展的道路上还得要继续进行斗争。
