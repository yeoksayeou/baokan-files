　　Six Hundred Blind People Regain Sight
　　In 1956, the Hanoi Eye Hospital treated more than six hundred blind people, enabling them to regain their sight. The hospital used the tissue therapy method of Soviet Academician Filatov to treat seventy-eight blind people. Another eighty-eight patients were blinded because pterygium grew on their corneas, obscuring their pupils. Eye doctors adopted artificial pupil methods or removed the pterygium and transplanted corneas from deceased individuals to cure them. Four hundred and forty-two blind people suffering from cataracts regained their sight after surgical treatment.

　　Establishment of Trachoma Research Institute
　　The reactionary rule of French colonialism in Vietnam for decades left three diseases: syphilis, malaria, and trachoma. After the restoration of peace, the Soviet Union sent a medical team composed of many experienced experts to North Vietnam to help the people treat these diseases with emphasis. Now, in order to further study and eradicate trachoma, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to establish a Trachoma Research Institute in the near future. This will be the first specialized disease research institute in Vietnam. The institute will have the latest instruments and equipment aided by the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and forty to fifty Vietnamese medical experts will work there.

　　Reconstruction of Geophysical Stations
　　The two geophysical stations located in Kienan Province and Laocai Province in North Vietnam are relatively ideal in terms of both location selection and equipment, but they were destroyed in the past during the war. In order to welcome the "International Geophysical Year," the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided to start reconstruction in February of this year. After three months of efforts, it has now been basically completed. (Hanoi News from this newspaper)

    六百盲人重见光明
    1956年，河内眼科医院治疗了六百多个盲人，使他们恢复视力，重见光明。这个医院运用苏联费拉托夫院士的组织疗法，救治了七十八个盲人。另有八十八个病人因为角膜上长眼翳，遮蔽了瞳孔而失明。眼科大夫采取人工瞳孔的办法，或采取切除眼翳用死人的角膜移植的办法，替他们治好了。有四百四十二个患白内障的盲者，在动手术治疗之后恢复了视力。
    成立砂眼病研究院
    法国殖民主义过去几十年的反动统治，在越南遗留下三种疾病：梅毒、疟疾、砂眼。和平恢复后，苏联曾经派一个包括许多富有经验的专家组成的医疗队，前来越南北方帮助人民有重点地治疗这几种疾病。现在为了进一步研究和根治砂眼，越南民主共和国政府决定在最近成立一所砂眼病研究院。这将是越南第一所专门疾病研究院。这所研究院将拥有苏联及各兄弟国家援助的最新式的仪器和设备，将有四、五十名越南的医学专家在里面工作。
    重建地球物理台
    位置在越南北方建安省和老街省的两个地球物理台，不论是地区的选择或是仪器的设备都比较理想，但是过去在战争中被破坏了。为了迎接“国际地球物理年”，越南民主共和国政府决定自今年2月开始重建，经过三个月的努力，现在已基本上完成了。（本报河内讯）
