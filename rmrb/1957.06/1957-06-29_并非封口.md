　　Since the Communist Party invited the democratic parties and people from all classes and strata to help the Party rectify its work style, various correct and beneficial opinions and criticisms have been put forward, which are unanimously welcomed by the people of the whole country and the Party. However, there are also many absurd remarks, echoing each other, forming an anti-socialist countercurrent. Some of those who made these fallacies are important leaders of democratic parties, and some are people's teachers who teach the younger generation. Can we who love socialism ignore this phenomenon? The People's Daily has successively published several editorials, refuting these fallacies that endanger the interests of the people, which is timely, necessary, and should be and has been welcomed by the vast majority of readers.

　　But some people have a different view. They either believe that these editorials are "labeling," blocking the channels of speech and increasing people's concerns; or they believe that these remarks are not necessarily anti-socialist, and such a large-scale rebuttal is really "making a fuss about nothing." Some people even say that the Communist Party asks people to give opinions, and then refutes the opinions, which shows a lack of magnanimity in accepting criticism. Is "the speaker is not guilty" just empty words?

　　First of all, let us see if these fallacies are anti-socialist. Zhang Bojun wanted to establish a "Political Design Institute," which is a negation of our people's congress's basic political system. He wanted to transform the CPPCC into an upper house, which is to implement the deceptive two-party system of capitalism. This would eliminate the people's democratic dictatorship. Chu Anping's "Party Empire" fallacy was to fire the opening shot for Zhang Bojun. Huang Xinping's demand for the rotation of power among various parties is an old version of Zhang Bojun's set of ideas.

　　Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest is unearned income, not exploitation; that bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism, as if there were no bureaucracy under capitalism; and that the bourgeoisie has no dual nature, and there is no essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class. If so, why is the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, necessary? Why bother talking about eliminating exploitation, transforming the bourgeoisie, and building socialism?

　　Luo Longji wanted to organize a self-contained "Rehabilitation Committee." His distrust and hatred of the Communist Party, which led the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, can be imagined. Ge Peiqi said that the masses want to kill the Communist Party members, and that even if the Communist Party is gone, China will not perish. Can it be imagined that such a person has a shred of belief in the leadership of the Communist Party? Isn't he deeply hateful of socialism? Chen Xingui said it more bluntly: to eliminate the three evils, the dictatorship of the proletariat must be eliminated.

　　These fallacies are definitely against socialism and against the leadership of the Communist Party. There is no question of randomly labeling here.

　　Socialism is the correct and bright direction that our country's constitution has already stipulated and that the people of the whole country have been following for several years under the leadership of the Communist Party. What Zhang Bojun and others oppose is this direction. Can we say that we can tolerate it, and that this is a trivial matter that does not need to be taken seriously?

　　This is definitely not a trivial matter.

　　We believe that, except for a few right-wing elements, the vast majority of the people in our country support the leadership of the Party and understand the great significance of the Party's leadership. Needless to say, the democratic parties accept the leadership of the Communist Party as their basic political program. Then, on such a major issue of right-wing elements trying to reverse the direction of nation-building, are we willing to listen to the Party's opinions? Is so-called leadership just a nominal position, not specifically manifested in practical issues? If we are willing to listen to the Party's opinions, instead of just verbally acknowledging the Party's leadership, I think that taking some of the attention that is being given to reading anti-socialist remarks with relish and giving it to reading the People's Daily editorials will probably not increase concerns or "sigh deeply" because of "making a fuss about nothing." If concerns are increased, or even if one cannot help but "sigh deeply," then it is better to "seek the cause in oneself." The Party cannot ignore its sacred responsibility to the people at important junctures!

    自从共产党请各民主党派和各阶级、阶层的人民帮助党整风以来，各方面提出许多正确有益的意见和批评，这是全国人民和党一致欢迎的。但是也有不少荒谬透顶的言论，此呼彼应，形成了反社会主义的逆流。发这些谬论的有的是民主党派的重要领导人，有的是教导青年一代的人民教师。这种现象，岂容我们爱护社会主义的人忽视？人民日报陆续发表了几篇社论，对这些危害人民利益的谬论加以驳斥，是及时的，必要的，应该得到，也得到了绝大多数读者的欢迎。
    但是也有一些人别有一种看法。他们或者认为这些社论是“扣帽子”，堵塞言路，增加了人们的顾虑；或者认为这些言论不见得就是反社会主义的，那样大张旗鼓的驳斥真是“小题大作”。有的人甚至说，共产党请人家提意见，提了意见又加以反驳，太没有虚心接受批评的雅量了，“言者无罪”，岂不是一句空话吗？
    首先让我们看一看这些谬论是不是反社会主义的。章伯钧要成立“政治设计院”，这就是否定了我们人民代表大会的基本政治制度。他要变政协为上议院，这就是要实行资本主义的骗人的两党制。这样就没有了人民民主专政。储安平的“党天下”谬论就是为章伯钧发射开路炮。黄心平所要求的各党轮流执政，是章伯钧那一套东西的旧版本。
    章乃器说什么定息是不劳而获的收入，不是剥削；说什么官僚主义比资本主义还危险，仿佛资本主义下就没有官僚主义；说什么资产阶级没有两面性，资产阶级和工人阶级没有什么本质的不同。既然这样，还何必要工人阶级及其先锋队共产党的领导？还何必高谈什么消灭剥削，改造资产阶级，建设社会主义？
    罗隆基要组织自成系统的“平反委员会”，他对领导肃反运动的共产党的不信任和仇恨，也就可想而知了。葛佩琦说群众要杀共产党人了，又说共产党亡了，中国也不会亡。难道可以设想，这样人有一丝一毫相信共产党领导的意思吗？他不是深入骨髓的痛恨社会主义吗？陈新桂更说得干脆：要消灭三害，只有消灭无产阶级专政。
    这些谬论肯定是反对社会主义，反对共产党领导的。这里毫没有什么乱扣帽子的问题。
    社会主义是我国宪法已经规定，全国人民在共产党领导下已经走了几年的正确光明的方向。章伯钧等人所反对的就是这个方向。难道说我们可以容忍，可以认为这是不必介意的小事吗？
    这绝对不是小事。
    我们相信，除了少数的右派分子，我国绝大多数人民都拥护党的领导，了解党的领导的重大意义。各民主党派更不消说，接受共产党的领导是它们的基本的政治纲领。那么，在这样右派分子要扭转建国方向的重大问题上，我们是不是愿意听听党的意见呢？所谓领导，是不是只能挂名悬空，不在实际问题上具体表现出来呢？若是愿意听听党的意见，而不是只在口头上承认党的领导，我想，将阅读反社会主义言论的津津有味的注意力分一点出来看看人民日报的社论，大概也不会因此就增加了顾虑，为“小题大作”而“长叹息”吧。若是增加了顾虑，或竟至非“长叹息”不可了，那原因，还是“反求诸己”为好。党在重要关头，不能忽略它对人民的神圣责任！
