Xinhua News Agency, London, June 1st: British business circles, who have long intended to expand trade with China, are eager to try after the British government announced its decision to relax trade restrictions.

It is reported that the Sino-British Trade Council will soon organize an economic delegation of "a large number" of representatives from major British industrial and commercial companies to China.

British trade figures say that a large number of applicants have requested to visit China in order to develop trade relations.

Rolls-Royce, the largest engine manufacturer, announced on May 31 that it is actively preparing plans for sales to China.

The manager of Brush Electrical Engineering Company Group, one of Britain's largest electrical equipment manufacturers, issued a statement saying that the government's decision is greatly beneficial to the group's export business. He also said that the Chinese trade delegation has already visited West Germany, and the government should also invite them to London.
