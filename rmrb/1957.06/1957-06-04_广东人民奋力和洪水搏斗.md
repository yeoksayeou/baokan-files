　　Special dispatch to the People's Daily from Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The people of Guangdong along the river are now fighting bravely against the floods.
　　From May 12th, Guangdong has been continuously hit by heavy rains. By the 24th, the rainfall in Haifeng and Lufeng counties in ten days was greater than the rainfall in the Yellow River basin in the north in two years. After concentrating efforts to deal with the emergency in various places, the province's major rivers safely passed the first flood peak, but due to the excessive rainfall and mountain torrents, serious disasters occurred in some areas. According to statistics, more than 30 counties in the province were hit by heavy rain, and more than 2.6 million mu of farmland were flooded. When the floods struck, the enlarged cadre meetings being held in Haifeng, Lufeng, Zengcheng and other counties immediately stopped, and thousands of cadres rushed to the disaster areas to carry out rescue work selflessly in the midst of thunderstorms and surging floods. All the cadres in Haifeng County led the county's farmers to fight against the overflowing floods twice in ten days, rescuing four thousand disaster victims in danger on the 23rd alone. The Secretary of the CPC Huilai County Committee and the County Head, along with the farmers, carried soil and drove piles to repair the embankments. The Commissioners of the Foshan and Zhanjiang Special Zones personally protected the embankments with the farmers and went deep into the disaster areas to lead the disaster relief work. When rescuing disaster victims or state property in the floods, ten People's Liberation Army soldiers and state organ cadres in the province gloriously gave their lives.
　　Thanks to the concerted efforts of state cadres and the people, the post-disaster recovery work in various places has progressed relatively quickly and effectively. After the heavy rain caused the disaster, the province, while sending condolences to the disaster areas, also allocated a large amount of relief funds, loans and commercial fertilizers to strongly support the disaster-stricken farmers in carrying out production and disaster relief. In the severely affected Huiyang Special Zone, about 300,000 people were mobilized every day in late May to engage in recovery work. In the days immediately following the flood, farmers in Lufeng County repaired more than 3,700 small-scale water conservancy projects that had been washed away, and also washed, replanted, and changed crops on 65,000 mu of crops, rescuing the severely affected crops throughout the county.
　　In the past few days, the heavy rain in many areas has temporarily stopped, but new heavy rain has appeared in the Hepu area. The downstream of the Dongjiang and Beijiang rivers has also repeatedly experienced flood peaks recently, and the flood peaks often exceed the warning water level. According to weather forecasts, there may be more rain in the province in the next two months. The fight against floods is still very tense.

    广东人民奋力和洪水搏斗
    本报特约新华社广州电　广东沿江各地人民现正奋力和洪水搏斗。
    从5月12日起，广东连续受到暴雨的袭击。到24日，海丰、陆丰县十天内的雨量比北方黄河流域两年的雨量还要大。经各地集中力量抢险，全省大江大河都安全度过了第一次洪峰，但由于雨量过猛，山洪暴发，在局部地区造成严重的灾情。据统计，全省有三十多个县暴雨成灾，受淹农田二百六十万多亩。洪水猛扑来时，海丰、陆丰、增城等县正在举行的扩大干部会议立刻停下来，数千干部迅速奔赴灾区，在雷雨交加和洪水汹涌中忘我地进行抢救工作。海丰县全体干部在十天内两度领导全县农民和泛滥的洪水搏斗，仅在23日一天内就抢救了四千灾民出险。中共惠来县委书记和县长等和农民们一道挑土、打桩修复堤围。佛山、湛江专区的专员亲身和农民一道护堤，并深入到灾区领导救灾工作。在洪水中抢救灾民或国家物资时，全省有十个人民解放军军人和国家机关干部，光荣地献出自己的生命。
    由于国家干部和人民的通力合作，各地灾后的恢复工作进展就比较快，效果比较好。暴雨成灾后，省里在派出慰问团深入灾区慰问的同时，还先后拨下大量的救济款、贷款和商品肥料等，大力支援灾区农民开展生产救荒。受灾严重的惠阳专区5月下旬每天能出动约三十万人投入恢复生产工作。陆丰县农民在洪水刚过的数天内，就修好被冲坏的小型水利工程三千七百多处，还有六万五千亩农作物进行了洗苗、补种和改种，全县受害严重的作物部分都抢救过来。
    最近几天，许多地区的暴雨虽暂告停止，但合浦地区又出现了新的暴雨。东江和北江下游近来也屡屡出现洪峰，并且洪峰常超过警戒水位。根据气象预报，省内在今后两个月内雨水还可能较多。防汛斗争仍然很紧张。
