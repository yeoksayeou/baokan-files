Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch: Zheng Xingfei, deputy director of the Daqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenyang County, Liaoning Province, said: Ge Peiqi said that the only people whose living standards have improved are "Party members and cadres," implying that the lives of ordinary people have not improved at all. This is nonsense. Now, please let Ge Peiqi come and see the situation in our cooperative. More than 70% of our cooperative's 840-plus members were poor and hired peasants before liberation, living a hard life of not having enough to eat or wear every year. But since the Communist Party led us in carrying out land reform and establishing cooperatives, people's lives have truly become as different as heaven and earth compared to the past. Last year, the entire cooperative averaged 4,620 jin of grain per hectare, an increase of 71% compared to the time when we farmed individually before collectivization. The average income per member household was 490 yuan, not including income from household side occupations. 97% of the members have increased their income compared to before joining the cooperative. Now, all the members are living above a middle-class life, with every family well-fed and clothed. The cooperative also has a library, a club, an amateur theater troupe, and wired broadcasting, and cultural life is also very active. Isn't this a life that farmers couldn't even dream of before liberation? Therefore, we farmers firmly disagree with Ge Peiqi's erroneous views.

　　解放前农民梦也梦不到这种生活
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省沈阳县大青农业生产合作社副主任郑兴飞说：葛佩琦说什么生活水平提高的只是“党员和干部”，意思是说老百姓的生活都没有改善，这都是瞎说，现在，就请葛佩琦来看看我们合作社的情况吧。我们合作社八百四十多户社员，解放前70％以上是贫雇农，年年过着吃不饱穿不暖的苦日子。但是自从共产党领导我们进行了土地改革，办了合作社，人们的生活和过去相比真有天上地下之别。去年全社平均每垧地打了四千六百二十斤粮食，比合作化前一家一户耕种时提高了71％，平均每户社员收入了四百九十元，家庭副业收入还不在内，97％的社员都比入社前增加了收入。现在全部社员都过着中等以上的生活，家家丰衣足食。合作社里还有图书室、俱乐部、业余剧团和有线广播，文化生活也非常活跃，难道这不是解放以前农民做梦也梦不到的生活吗？因此，对于葛佩琦的错误论调，我们农民是坚决不能同意的。
