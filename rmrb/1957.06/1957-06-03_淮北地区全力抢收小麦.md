    Hefei, June 2nd (By Our Correspondent) - The Huaibei region of Anhui Province, an important wheat-producing area in China, has begun harvesting its 34 million mu of wheat. Thus far, the threat of natural disasters to wheat growth in Huaibei has been lifted. The head of the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Department only now told reporters that a bumper wheat harvest in Huaibei is within sight this year.
    Last winter, wheat planting in the Huaibei region was the most timely since liberation. The wheat seeds were of good quality, there were many varieties, the grains were full, and growth was good. Huaibei farmers have been discussing that this year's wheat harvest may be even better than in 1955. Huaiyuan County, which suffered severe disasters last year, estimates that 880,000 mu out of the county's more than 2 million mu of wheat can yield an average of 200 to 300 jin per mu; the rest can also exceed the 1955 level. Fuyang County estimates that the average yield per mu will be more than ten jin higher than in 1955.
    The leaders of Anhui Province and the farmers in Huaibei attach great importance to the wheat harvest. The Anhui Provincial People's Committee and the military region have notified all agencies, schools, and troops to spare as much manpower and animal power as possible to help farmers harvest wheat. It is also stipulated that the heads of agencies and troops lead their personnel, generally doing at least two workdays per person on average during the wheat harvest. All middle schools have a ten-day vacation to help farmers with harvesting. The leaders of the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Department have also invited a large number of tractor drivers and combine operators from Heilongjiang and Liaoning to operate machinery to support farmers in summer harvesting and planting.
    Agricultural cooperatives in various places have learned from last year's lesson of insufficient preparation for rushing to harvest wheat and have made early arrangements for labor and animal power. In many counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives in flood discharge, flood storage areas, and areas with severe waterlogging, rush harvest and water removal headquarters have also been established, and two sets of summer harvest plans have been made to cope with good and bad weather. The first bumper harvest of the year is in sight, and the people of the entire Huaibei region have thrown themselves into the struggle to rush harvest.

    淮北地区全力抢收小麦
    本报合肥2日电　我国重要产麦区安徽省淮北地区，三千四百万亩小麦，已经开镰收割。至此，自然灾害对于淮北小麦生长的威胁解除了。安徽省农业部门的负责人直到现在才肯告诉记者：今年淮北小麦丰收有了指望。
    去冬淮北地区的小麦是解放以来种得比较适时的一年，麦种优良、品种也多，籽粒饱满，生长良好。淮北农民纷纷议论，今年小麦比1955年的收成可能还好。据去年的重灾县怀远县估计，全县二百多万亩小麦，有八十八万亩可平均收到二百至三百斤；其余也可超过1955年的水平。阜阳县估计每亩平均可比1955年多收十几斤。
    安徽省领导方面和淮北农民，都十分重视麦收工作。安徽省人民委员会和军区通知各机关、学校和部队，尽量抽出人、畜力帮助农民收麦。并规定机关、部队的负责人带领所属人员，一般在麦收期间平均每人最少做两个工作日。各中等学校放假十天，帮助农民收割。安徽省农业部门领导方面并从黑龙江、辽宁请来大批拖拉机手和康拜因手，开动机器支援农民进行夏收夏种。
    各地农业社，都接受了去年对抢收小麦准备不够的教训，及早安排了劳力、畜力。在行洪、蓄洪区和内涝严重地区的许多县、区、乡和农业社，还成立了抢收打涝指挥部，做了应付好、坏天气的两套夏收计划。今年的第一个丰收就在眼前，淮北全区人民投入了抢收的斗争。
