　　Celebrating the New Year
　　Xin Fengxia
　　My little niece goes to kindergarten, and her grandmother bought her a lot of things. Her clothes are all brand new inside and out. Children are so happy in this society!

　　I can't help but think of my own childhood. When I was little, I lived in Yangjia Chai Factory, a slum in Nanshi, Tianjin, a large courtyard with more than a dozen families living in it. They were all poor people, some selling fried dough sticks, some selling scraps, some selling newspapers, some pulling rickshaws, some pulling dirt carts… All of them were frowning all year round. Even the children became as melancholy as adults.

　　I became sensible at a very young age. My family lived in a south-facing room. My grandmother was a paralyzed patient and could not get out of bed; my aunt was a widow in her fifties and also lived with us; my father sold fruit in a brothel; my mother took care of me and my younger sisters and brothers. In addition to my father earning money, my aunt and mother worked as outworkers (doing odd jobs for tailor shops). I learned to sew at a very young age, making small clothes for my younger sisters and brothers, washing clothes in large basins, cleaning the house, making fires, and cooking; taking apart large clothes to make them smaller was all my job.

　　I remember one time celebrating the New Year: my mother and aunt were busy with outwork, and my father was busy stocking up on New Year's goods. I also had to help my father peel hawthorn skins and wash fruit… During the New Year, children all wear new clothes. My new clothes were always dyed with flour sacks. I was as happy as if I had found a treasure when I dyed a pair of red pants for the New Year. On the night of the 29th of the lunar year, I folded my new pants and put them under my pillow before going to bed. I felt that night that dawn was so slow! I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, when suddenly my mother scolded me: "What's wrong with you? Adults are tired all day! Why aren't you asleep yet?" I finally waited for dawn, but my mother wouldn't let me wear them, saying, "Wear your new pants tonight, you still have to work during the day! Don't get them dirty." After nine o'clock in the evening, I put on my new pants, and my mother told me to wait for my father at the entrance of the alley of the Dan Gui Hou brothel to bring back money to buy flour (after twelve o'clock, the flour shops would close, and we wouldn't be able to buy any flour). I happily agreed and went. The alley of the brothel was filled with men and women, monthly rickshaws, and red lanterns hanging in front of every house, along with yellow paper ingots, it was very lively. But there was no sign of my father, so I had to lean against the wall and wait; slowly the people thinned out, and I was cold and sleepy, and fell asleep leaning against a garbage can. Suddenly, a sound came from the brothel, "Clatter! Clatter!" continuously, and someone shouted, "Oh! Oh! Someone's being beaten to death!" Then I heard: "You should ask for auspiciousness during the New Year." A group of Japanese soldiers came out of the brothel, staggering, as if they were drunk. One of the soldiers grabbed a teenage girl and dragged her out of the alley. The girl was wearing a red satin coat and trousers, with disheveled hair and a face full of blood, struggling and crying. "Shameless! Bitch!" It turned out that the soldier grabbing the girl was a Chinese man wearing a Japanese soldier's uniform. I knew it when I heard him speak. In a moment, this group of people squeezed to the entrance of the alley, and I found my father was also in the middle, his clothes were also torn, and he was throwing a basket very high in his hand. I don't know where I got the courage, but I ran into the crowd and picked up the basket. My father said, "This group of beasts smashed the brothel and even robbed my money! Chinese people dressing as Japanese! They have even forgotten who their ancestors are!"

　　I took my father home, knowing that he had been angered; I didn't dare mention the matter of asking for money to buy flour to my father at all. My family didn't even eat dumplings for the New Year.

　　A sentence that my mother often loved to say: "You don't know the price of firewood and rice until you run a household, and you don't know the gratitude to your mother until you raise children." I think this old saying is very true. Happy children in the new society, they have not suffered, how can they feel that the taste of the new society is as sweet as honey? Although there are many picture book stories for them to see, they are not as profound as the impressions we personally received when we were young. When my father sees me buying things, he says: "People can't forget their roots, when you pick up the bowl, think about the kiln. It is enough for the children to have clothes to wear and things to play with, don't always gild the lily, buying endlessly. If you always give him new clothes and new toys, he won't understand the difficulties, and he will take everything too easily. If you do this, you are not loving him, you are harming him." That's true. Now children don't know what it means to be difficult. At least the problem of eating is not a problem in their eyes. But when we were young, eating was really the most important problem.

　　过年
　　新凤霞
    我的小侄女送幼儿园，外婆买了很多东西，衣服全是里面三新的。孩子们在这个社会是多么幸福哇！
    我不觉想起自己小时候，我小时住在天津南市贫民区的杨家柴厂、一个大杂院。一院住了十几家，都是贫民，有卖油条的、卖破烂的、卖报的、拉洋车的、拉土车的……都是一年到头愁眉苦脸。小孩子也变的像大人一样的忧郁。
    我很小就懂事。我们一家人住一间南房。祖母是半身不遂的病人，不能下地；姑母是寡妇，五十多岁，也住在我家；父亲在妓院卖水果；母亲带着我和妹妹、弟弟们。除了父亲挣钱外，我姑母和母亲作外活（给裁缝铺作下手活）。我很小就会作针线活，给妹妹弟弟们作小衣服，大盆洗衣服，收拾屋子，生火、作饭；拆大改小都是我一个人的事。
    记得有一次过年：母亲和姑母忙外活，父亲忙着添年货。我还要帮着父亲剥红果皮，洗水果……。过年小孩子都穿新衣服。我的新衣服永远是用装面的口袋染，过年染一条红裤罩，像得宝贝一样高兴。年二十九晚上睡前把新裤叠好放在枕头底下。这一夜可觉得天亮得慢哪！翻来复去睡不着，突然母亲骂我：“你怎么了？大人累一天！你还不睡？”好容易盼着天亮了，母亲不许我穿，说：“新裤罩晚上穿，白天还干活哪！别弄脏。”晚上九点多了，穿上新裤，母亲叫我到丹桂后妓院的胡同口等父亲，拿钱回来好买面（过了十二点面铺上门，就买不上面了）。我高高兴兴一口答应就去了。妓院的胡同里男男女女，包月洋车，家家门前挂着红灯，黄纸叠成的元宝，很热闹。可是不见父亲的影子，只好倚着墙等；慢慢的人少了，我是又冷又困，倚着垃圾箱睡着了。忽然从妓院里出来一种声音“哗啦！哗啦”不住的响，有人喊“哎呀！哎呀！打死人了！”又听说：“过年您要求个吉庆。”一群日本兵从妓院里出来了，一个个东倒西歪，好像喝醉了。其中一个兵抓着一个十几岁的姑娘往胡同口外走。这姑娘身穿红缎裤袄，披头散发，满脸是血，挣扎着哭喊。“不要脸！贱货！”原来抓着姑娘的兵是一个穿着日本兵服的中国人，听他说话才知道。这伙人一会工夫就挤到胡同口了，我发现父亲也在当中，衣服也被撕破了，手里提篮飞得很高。我也不知那来的胆子，硬跑进人群拾起篮子。父亲说：“这群野兽砸窑子，连我的钱都抢走了！中国人装日本！连他祖宗是谁都忘了！”
    我拉着父亲回家，知道父亲受了气；要钱买面的事，根本没敢向父亲提。一家人过年都没吃上饺子。
    我母亲常爱说的一句话：“不当家不知柴米贵，不养儿不知报娘的恩。”我觉得这句老话很对。新社会的幸福儿童，他们没有受过苦，怎么能觉着新社会的味甜如蜜呢？虽然有很多小人书上的故事给他们看，但总不如我们小时候亲身受到的印象深刻。我父亲见着我买东西就说：“人不能忘本，端起碗想想窑，孩子们有穿的有玩的就够了，别老是锦上添花，买起没完。你老送他新衣服、新玩具，他就不懂得难处了，什么事都看易了，这样你就不是爱他，你是害他。”真是这样。现在的小孩子们不知道为难，起码吃饭问题在他们看来是不成问题的。可我们小时候吃饭真是最要命的问题呀。
