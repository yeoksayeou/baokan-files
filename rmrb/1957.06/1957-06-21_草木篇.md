　　Grass and Trees
　　Liu Shahe
　　A word to those who establish themselves: Do not learn from the weak seedlings. - Tang: Bai Juyi
    Poplar
    She, a long sword with a shimmering green light, stands alone on the plain, pointing high to the blue sky. Perhaps a storm will uproot her. But, even if she dies, her waist will not bend to anyone!
    Wisteria
    He entwines himself around the lilac, climbing, climbing... finally hanging the flowers on the treetops. The lilac is strangled to death and chopped up for firewood. He falls to the ground, panting, eyeing another tree...
    Cactus
    She doesn't want to flatter her master with flowers, covering herself with bayonets. The master expels her from the garden and doesn't even give her water. In the wilderness, in the desert, she lives and breeds children...
    Plum Blossom
    Among her sisters, her love comes the latest. In spring, when all the flowers use charming smiles to entice butterflies, she quietly pledges herself to the white snow of winter. Frivolous butterflies are not worthy to kiss her, just as other flowers are not worthy to be caressed by the white snow. Among her sisters, she smiles the latest, smiles the most beautifully.
    Poisonous Mushroom
    He appears on the riverbank where the sun doesn't shine. By day, with beautiful colorful clothes, by night, with a dark green phosphorescence, he tempts mankind. However, even a three-year-old child doesn't pick him. Because, Mom said, that's the saliva of a poisonous snake.　　　　　　　　　October 30, 1956
    Editor's Note: "Grass and Trees" was originally published in the inaugural issue of the poetry magazine "Stars" published in Chengdu (published in January 1957). After its publication, it aroused much criticism and controversy in Sichuan literary and art circles. Many of these criticisms are correct, as they criticize this group of poems for promoting individualism that is detached from the masses and indulges in self-admiration, and for spreading dissatisfaction and hostility towards society; it is believed that this group of poems is harmful to readers. Some critical articles were also relatively rude in their attitude, and these articles also caused dissatisfaction among literary and art workers. The author, Liu Shahe, in his talk with a reporter from Shanghai Wenhui Daily and in his speech at the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles last month, although he admitted that he "retains a kind of arrogance, thinking himself to be proud and unyielding from his thoughts to his style, in his dealings with the world and as a person," he expressed that he could not accept the criticism of many people. He said that "Grass and Trees" was only "too obscure in its expression and one-sided in its observation of life, seeing the trees but not the forest." He "does not agree with some people who say that the criticism is basically correct, only the method is a bit rough." He believes that "this criticism is not only dogmatic, but also sectarian." He described many criticisms as "cruel," "personal attacks, political intimidation," "rampant," and "excluding dissidents." He believes that the article "After Reading Grass and Trees" in the February issue of "Grassland" "is the peak, this article is a declaration of denunciation, raising many questions that can be regarded as organizing a larger-scale second encirclement." He believes that the criticism of articles defending "Grass and Trees" is "guilt by association, with all nine generations being executed," and so on. He described the criticism of him by the Communist Youth League organization as "reversing black and white, which is heartbreaking." He also said that because of this group of poems, he was subjected to "suppression" within the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and that his freedom of communication and movement were violated, etc. (see Shanghai Wenhui Daily on May 16 and Sichuan Daily on May 17). At a symposium held by the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles from the 14th of last month to the 13th of this month, the merits of the criticism of "Grass and Trees" were discussed. Literary and art workers such as Sha Ting, Yuan Ke, Zhang Zehou, Lan Tingbin, Liu Junhui, Wang Yifen, Xiao Manruo, Shan Mei, etc., in their speeches, all believed that "Grass and Trees" should be criticized. Liu Junhui also pointed out: "Liu Shahe said at the previous meeting that he would rather go to a capitalist country to be a free poor child, this is what Liu Shahe said with confidence and righteousness, this is the author's political attitude, the most distinct expression of his love and hatred." Therefore, "in essence, 'Grass and Trees' is an anti-socialist work." Li Lei, the person in charge of the Party branch of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, who was accused by Liu Shahe of infringing on human rights, and other staff members, also pointed out at the recent symposium that Liu Shahe's accusation that the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles "suppressed" him was groundless. Li Lei said: The fact is: the Communist Youth League organization criticized Liu Shahe's ideological style in February last year, and after the publication of "Grass and Trees," the Communist Youth League organization also criticized him, but this is different from the criticism in the newspapers and periodicals. Other so-called "deprivation of freedom of communication," "infringement of personal freedom," etc., are also not in line with the facts. They also exposed that when Liu Shahe heard the criticism of another poem "Kiss" in "Stars," he publicly cursed: "These minister-level officials are neurasthenic," "I don't care about you righteous gentlemen minister-level officials, if you interfere with me, I will strike, I will rebel."
    The editorial department of this newspaper has received letters from some readers asking about the specific content of "Grass and Trees." In addition to having replied separately, we are now reprinting this group of poems here, and providing the above simple introduction to the criticism of "Grass and Trees." More details will be reported later.

　　寄言立身者　勿学柔弱苗——唐：白居易
    白杨
    她，一柄绿光闪闪的长剑，孤零零地立在平原，高指蓝天。也许，一场暴风会把她连根拔去。但，纵然死了吧，她的腰也不肯向谁弯一弯！
    藤
    他纠缠着丁香，往上爬，爬，爬……终于把花挂上树梢。丁香被缠死了，砍作柴烧了。他倒在地上，喘着气，窥视着另一株树……
    仙人掌
    她不想用鲜花向主人献媚，遍身披上刺刀。主人把她逐出花园，也不给水喝。在野地里，在沙漠中她活着，繁殖着儿女……
    梅
    在姐姐妹妹里，她的爱情来得最迟。春天，百花用媚笑引诱蝴蝶的时候，她却把自己悄悄地许给了冬天的白雪。轻佻的蝴蝶是不配吻她的，正如别的花不配被白雪抚爱一样。在姐姐妹妹里，她笑得最晚，笑得最美丽。
    毒菌
    在阳光照不到的河岸，他出现了。白天，用美丽的彩衣，黑夜，用暗绿的磷火，诱惑人类。然而，连三岁孩子也不去采他。因为，妈妈说过，那是毒蛇吐的唾液。　　　　　　　　　1956年10月30日
    编者按：“草木篇”原载成都出版的诗歌刊物“星星”创刊号（1957年1月出版）。发表后，在四川文艺界引起许多批评和争论。其中许多批评是正确的，它们批评了这组宣扬了脱离群众、孤高自赏的个人主义，散播了对社会的不满和敌对情绪；认为这组诗对读者是有害的。也有一些批评文章在态度上是比较粗暴的，这些文章也引起文艺界人士的不满。作者流沙河上月中在对上海文汇报记者的谈话和在四川省文联座谈会的发言里，虽承认自己“从思想到作风，处世为人，都保留着一种骄气，自以为傲骨嶙峋”，但却表示不能接受许多人的批评。他说“草木篇”只是“表现手法太隐晦，生活观察又带片面性，见木不见林”。他“不同意有人说的批评是基本上对的，只是方式有点粗暴”。他认为“这一批评不仅是教条主义，而且是宗派主义”。他把许多批评，形容为“残酷”、“人身攻击，政治恐吓”、“猖狂”、“排斥异端”，他认为“草地”二月号上“草木篇书后”一文“是高峰，这篇文章是声讨宣言，提出了很多问题，可以看成要组织更大规模的第二期围剿。”他认为对为“草木篇”辩护的文章所进行的批评是“连坐法，九族皆诛”等等。他把团组织对他的批评说成是“颠倒黑白，叫人痛心”。他还说由于这组诗，他受到四川省文联机关内部的“压制”，通信、行动自由都遭到侵犯等等（见5月16日上海文汇报和5月17日四川日报）。在上月14日至本月13日四川省文联邀请文艺界人士陆续举行的座谈会上，曾经讨论了对“草木篇”批评的是非问题。文艺界人士沙汀、袁珂、张泽厚、蓝庭彬、刘君惠、王益奋、萧蔓若、山莓等在发言中，都认为“草木篇”是应该批评的。刘君惠并指出：“流沙河在前次会上发言，说他宁肯到资本主义国家去作自由的贫困儿，这个话流沙河是理直气壮地说出来的，这就是作者的政治态度，他的爱和憎的最鲜明的表现。”因此，“按本质说来，‘草木篇’是反社会主义的作品。”被流沙河指为侵犯人权的省文联党支部负责人李累及其他工作人员，在最近的座谈会上也指出流沙河指控省文联机关对于他的“压制”是无中生有的。李累说：事实是：团组织在去年二月曾批评过流沙河的思想作风，在“草木篇”发表后，团组织也批评过他，但这同报刊上的批评是两回事。其他所谓“剥夺通讯自由”、“侵犯人身自由”等等，也都不符合事实。他们并揭发流沙河在听到对“星星”上另一首诗“吻”的批评时，曾经公开辱骂：“这些部长老爷们神经衰弱”，“我不管你们这些正人君子部长老爷，你们干涉老子，老子就罢工，老子就造反。”
    本报编辑部曾接到一些读者来信，询问“草木篇”的具体内容。除已分别答复外，现将这组诗转载在这里，并将有关“草木篇”的批评作如上的简单的介绍。详细情况，以后另作报道。
