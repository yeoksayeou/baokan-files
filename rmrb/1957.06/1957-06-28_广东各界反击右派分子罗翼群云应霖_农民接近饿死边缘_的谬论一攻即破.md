Guangdong Circles Counterattack Rightists Luo Yiqun and Yun Yinglin
The Fallacy of "Farmers Approaching the Brink of Starvation" is Defeated With One Blow

(Our report) Following the wild and absurd utterances of some rightists in Beijing, rightists in Guangdong Province have also issued a series of anti-socialist cries. At the beginning of the movement, rightists proposed opposing the gentle breeze and fine rain, advocating "setting fire to the mountain." Then, they denied the achievements of Guangdong's seven years of work. They insisted on only talking about shortcomings and mistakes. Whoever spoke of merits, they arrogantly scolded as "lackeys" and "flatterers." After their reactionary remarks were refuted by public opinion, they used a seemingly retreating but actually attacking posture, saying: Sure enough, as expected, now it is "closing in." They even described people's rebuttals as "a continuation of the anti-counterrevolutionary campaign." Some people openly protested, saying that people's criticism of them would "have a negative impact internationally."

During this period, rightists in Guangdong Province, in addition to spreading rumors against the people's democratic dictatorship, against socialism, and against the leadership of the Communist Party, also focused on attacking the Party's leadership, the anti-counterrevolutionary work, and people's lives. The prominent representative of the rightists was Luo Yiqun, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Government Counselor's Office. He closed his eyes to the facts and said that the people of Guangdong were on the "brink of starvation." He said that he often received letters from various places, which were either "pleading for justice" or "complaining of hardship"; as if he was the only "honest official" in the world who cared about the people's suffering. Luo Yiqun's reactionary viewpoint was immediately applauded by Yun Yinglin, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. After Yun Yinglin returned from an inspection of Hainan last July, he said that the lives of farmers on Hainan Island were very hard, still at the level before liberation, or even worse than before liberation. And he said: "Everyone is worried about poverty, and life is not easy." This time he stepped forward and did not allow people to refute Luo Yiqun.

The remarks against the committee system of the Party committees initially started in universities. Some rightist professors described the Party committees of universities as "the hotbed of three evils," "the root of bureaucracy," and "the starting point of all bad things." The clamor to abolish the Party committees of universities was also echoed by some rightist officials in government departments. Li Hanchong, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Forestry Department, said that the Party groups in the organs restricted the powers of non-Party personnel and created a gap between Party members and non-Party members. Therefore, he advocated abolishing the Party groups in the organs and replacing the activities of the Party groups with administrative meetings. Rightists in the industrial and commercial circles also took the opportunity to clamor. Deng Junwan, deputy director of the Guangzhou Jianguo Factory, said that Communist Party members are "all those who climbed up through struggle, do not understand technology, and only know how to be spies." Therefore, he advocated abolishing the Party committees in the factories. Pan Yihe, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, on the one hand, wanted to extend the fixed interest for twenty years, and on the other hand, wanted to abolish the titles of "public side," "labor side," and "private side."

The frantic clamor of the rightists was met with strong opposition from public opinion. Southern Daily and Guangzhou Daily received many letters from factories, rural areas, and schools every day.

　　Let's See the Life of Farmers in Shipai Village

The three agricultural production cooperatives of Shuguang, Hongguang, and Yongguang in Shipai Village, a suburb of Guangzhou, held a symposium on the evening of the 18th. The farmers present listed iron-clad facts to refute Luo Yiqun's lie that "Guangdong farmers are approaching the brink of starvation." They warned Luo Yiqun not to spread rumors and confuse the public, and sow discord between farmers and the Communist Party after eating the grain grown by the farmers.

Chi Changchen, a cadre of Shipai Township from a poor peasant background, said that in our Shipai, farmers starving to death was something that happened before liberation. After liberation, not only did not a single farmer starve to death, but the lives of the vast majority of people are getting better and better. Take myself as an example. Before liberation, my family often starved to the point of swelling. What about now? Not only is life not a problem, but I also have 300 yuan deposited in the cooperative and 100 yuan deposited in the credit cooperative. My house, which was about to collapse, has now been repaired. In our village, the lives of all farmers who work actively have improved and are similar to my situation. Chi Deai, the accountant of Shuguang Cooperative, said that in 1956, 85% of the members of our cooperative increased their income, and more than 90% of the old members increased their income. Last year, the average income per household was more than 490 yuan, and the highest household reached more than 2,100 yuan.

The speakers also refuted Luo Yiqun's statement that "grain requisition and various taxes are too heavy" and "the purchase price of agricultural products is too low." Chi Rongxuan, deputy director of Hongguang Cooperative, said that the state's taxation is taken from the people and used for the people. The Communist Party did not put the money in its own pockets, but the People's Government used it to build socialism and seek welfare for the people. Those present calculated an account on the spot: the farmers of Shipai Village pay a total of more than 500,000 catties of grain in public grain every year; however, the People's Government spends more than 405,000 catties of grain every year just to pay the salaries of more than 40 teachers in primary schools and kindergartens, not to mention the government's payment of other expenses for schools and various social welfare undertakings. Moreover, in recent years, the government has spent more than 40,000 yuan to expand schools and more than 20,000 yuan to build a new cultural station. In particular, it has subsidized large amounts of money to build many water conservancy projects, and the subsidy for Shipai Dam alone is as high as 240,000 yuan. In the face of such a comparison, Luo Yiqun should think for himself whether the public grain paid by the farmers is too heavy!

Yun Yinglin Sows Discord and Slanders Progressive Elements

On the 17th, the members of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a joint meeting to criticize the anti-socialist remarks of Yun Yinglin, Luo Yiqun, and others, and condemned the anti-socialist remarks of Zhang Bojun and others. They unanimously demanded that Zhang Bojun make a self-criticism to all members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Mei Rixin, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and deputy director of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, criticized Yun Yinglin's erroneous ideas at the meeting. He said that according to the materials from the speech of Zhou Fahui, a representative of the people of Hainan at that time, the income of Hainan farmers is increasing year by year, and their purchasing power is also rising. The purchasing power of the whole region was 288 million yuan in 1954 and reached more than 300 million yuan in 1956. Mei Rixin said that this alone shows that the lives of farmers are improving year by year. Yun Yinglin's so-called "the life of Hainan farmers is too hard" and "not as good as before liberation" is a subjective, one-sided statement that turns a blind eye to the facts. It is just clamoring for a few people and singing in harmony with Luo Yiqun. He also pointed out that treating all progressive elements as people who sow discord and flatter is a great slander to the progressive elements of the Party and non-Party members. Its purpose is to alienate the relationship between the Party and the progressive elements of non-Party members, so that some rightists can use the guise of "the independence of democratic parties' organizations" to oppose the leadership of the Party and drag the work of the democratic parties backward. Of course, the people will not allow it.

　　Government Water Conservancy Projects Greatly Reduce Natural Disasters

At a symposium held by the Guangdong Provincial Committee and Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) on the 18th, He Baosong, a member of the RCCK and deputy director of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, cited facts in his speech to show that Luo Yiqun's statement was groundless. He said: Since liberation, the government has undertaken many basic construction projects in rural areas. The area of cultivated land benefiting from water conservancy projects in the province is 34 million mu, the area of dry land has been reduced by 3 million mu, and 1 million mu of protective forests have been created, which has greatly reduced natural disasters. The proportion of disasters has dropped from 60% to 70% in the early days of liberation in 1949 to 30% to 40% in 1954, changing the face of the historically serious disaster area. He gave an example: The Jianjiang Plain (including Wuchuan, Maoming, Hua County, etc.), which used to be plagued by disasters, in 1955 alone, the government allocated a special fund of 2.5 million yuan and sent a large number of technicians to conduct a comprehensive survey of water conservancy, forestry, and agriculture to make an overall plan. Irrigation projects were established in seven townships from Longshou Township in Maoming County to Xiepai Township in Hua County, thus getting rid of the threat of drought, and production doubled last year. In the past, there was a saying that "no daughter should marry Xiepai Township," but today the situation in Xiepai Township has also changed. Xiepai Township had a bumper harvest last year, and more than 5,000 new clothes were added to the township, the number of children enrolled in school increased, and more and more people got married.

He said: But what was the situation before liberation? The drought in Guangdong in 1943 was lighter than in 1955, but at that time, the number of people who starved to death along the coast was incalculable. Some people said it was one million, and more than 20,000 people starved to death in Huilai County alone. Even Taishan and Shunde counties, which were known for their wealth throughout the country, also saw a significant reduction in population after the disaster.

　　Production Continues to Grow and Farmers' Burdens are Reduced Year by Year

Qin Yuanbang, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the RCCK, questioned what position Luo Yiqun was speaking from? He said that Luo Yiqun's statement represents the opinions of those people who used to ride on the people's heads during the Chiang Kai-shek era. Those people can't enjoy themselves as they used to, so they write letters to Luo Yiqun to complain. This is the so-called basis for Luo Yiqun's saying that "people's lives have reached the brink of starvation." Qin Yuanbang said based on the current situation in Meixian: Meixian was also very short of food in the old society. I grew up eating porridge, but what about now? My nephews and others eat white rice. There are many such farmers, so how can you say that life has not improved?

At a forum of democratic personages held by the United Front Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Tan Dongqing, deputy director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, refuted Luo Yiqun's fallacy that taxes are too heavy with facts. He said, are our taxes too heavy? Take agricultural tax as an example! Under the condition that agricultural production is continuously growing, the agricultural tax burden of farmers is decreasing year by year. In 1951, the agricultural tax burden of farmers accounted for 15.44% of agricultural income; in 1952, it dropped to 12.3%; in 1953, it dropped to 11.43%; in 1954, it was 12.43% (because an additional 95 million catties of grain were levied to support the disaster area); in 1955, it dropped to 10.89%; in 1956, it dropped to 7.96%, and since 1956, production has increased without increasing taxes. How can you say it is heavy?

　　Rightists Have Not Yet Surrendered and Disarmed Class Struggle Continues to Unfold

Under the criticism of public opinion, the progressive forces of various democratic parties have begun to rise. They have come forward to criticize the reactionary remarks of the rightists and demand to draw a clear line between themselves and the rightists. Comrade Tao Zhu, first secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressed his sincere acceptance and heartfelt gratitude for the well-intentioned criticisms of non-Party members at a report meeting attended by more than 1,000 Party members and non-Party members on the 19th of this month. At the same time, he said that the fallacies of a very small number of rightists against socialism have become the biggest obstacle to the development of the current rectification movement. He called on all progressive people to counterattack the frantic attacks of the rightists to ensure the healthy development of the movement.

It is worth noting that although the rightists have suffered a preliminary counterattack, they have not surrendered and disarmed. Some of them are pretending to make self-criticism in an attempt to muddle through, some are denying what they said before, and some are going to the countryside to "investigate materials and collect evidence" in preparation for another battle. Obviously, the ideological struggle with the rightists is a serious class struggle, and it seems that it cannot be ended in a short time.

### 广东各界反击右派分子罗翼群云应霖  “农民接近饿死边缘”的谬论一攻即破

　　广东各界反击右派分子罗翼群云应霖
    “农民接近饿死边缘”的谬论一攻即破
    本报讯  随着北京的一些右派分子的狂言乱语，广东省的右派分子，也发出了一连串的反社会主义的叫嚣。右派分子在运动初期，提出反对和风细雨，主张“放火烧山”。接着他们又否定广东地方七年来的工作成绩。他们主张只说缺点和错误。谁说优点，他们就狂妄地骂人家是“狗腿子”、“拍马屁”。当他们的反动言论遭到社会舆论的驳斥以后，他们又用貌似退却实则进攻的姿态说：果然不出所料吧，现在是“收了”。他们还把人们的反驳说成是“肃反的继续”。有的人竟公然提出抗议，说人们对他们的批评，会在“国际上产生不良影响”。
    在这期间，广东地方的右派分子，除了散布反对人民民主专政、反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的流言蜚语以外，又着重地攻击了党的领导、肃反工作和人民生活。右派突出的代表人物是广东省参事室副主任罗翼群。他睁眼不看事实，说广东人民已处于“饿死的边缘”。他说他经常收到一些来自各地的信件，这些信件不是“鸣冤”，就是“叫苦”；好像世界上只有他是关心民间疾苦的“清官”。罗翼群的反动论点，立刻得到农工民主党广东省副主委云应霖的喝采。云应霖在去年7月视察海南归来以后，就说海南岛农民生活很苦，依然停留在解放前的水平，甚而不如解放以前。并且说：“人人正在忧贫，生活很不易过。”这次他挺身而出，不准人们反驳罗翼群。
    反对党委制的言论，最初是从高等学校开始的。教授中的一些右派分子，把高等学校的党委会，说成是“三害的温床”、“官僚主义的根源”、“一切坏事的出发点”。要求取消高等学校的党委会的叫嚣，也得到政府部门的一些右派分子的呼应。广东省林业厅副厅长李汉冲说，机关党组限制了党外人士的职权，造成了党与非党人士的隔阂。因此，他主张把机关党组取消，用行政会议代替党组的活动。工商界的右派分子，也乘机大肆叫嚣，广州建国厂副厂长邓君万说，共产党员都是“靠斗争爬起来的，不懂技术，只会做特务”，因此他主张取消工厂的党委。广州市工商联常委潘以和，一面要定息延长二十年，一面要取消“公方”、“劳方”、“私方”的名称。
    右派分子的疯狂叫嚣，遭到了社会舆论强烈反对。南方日报和广州日报，每天都收到许许多多的来自工厂、农村和学校的信件。
　　请看石牌村农民的生活
    广州市郊区石牌村曙光、红光、永光等三个农业生产合作社在18日晚上召开座谈会，到会的农民列举铁一般的事实，驳斥了罗翼群所谓“广东农民接近饿死的边缘”的谎言。他们警告罗翼群，不要吃了农民种出来的粮食之后，还来造谣惑众，挑拨农民同共产党的关系。
    贫农出身的石牌乡干部池昌尘说，在我们石牌，饿死农民是解放前的事情，解放后不但一个农民也没有饿死，而且绝大多数人生活越来越好。就说我自己，解放前一家人经常饿到身体发肿，现在呢？不但生活不成问题，还有三百元存在合作社里，有一百元存入信用社。我那间快要倒塌的房子，现在已经修好了。在我们村里，凡是积极劳动的农民，生活都提高了，同我的情况差不多。曙光社的会计池德爱说，在1956年我们社有85％的社员增加了收入，老社员增加收入的超过90％。去年每户平均收入四百九十多元，最高的一户达到二千一百多元。
    发言的人们又驳斥了罗翼群所谓“征粮及各种税收过重”“农产品收购价格偏低”的说法。红光社副主任池荣煊说，国家收税是取之于民、用之于民的，共产党并没有把钱放入自己口袋里，而是由人民政府用来建设社会主义、为人民谋福利。到会的人当场算了一笔账：石牌村全村农民每年交的公粮共五十多万斤谷；可是，人民政府仅仅为了支付小学和幼儿园的四十多个教师的薪金，每年便用去了粮食四十万五千多斤，政府支付的学校的其他经费以及各种社会福利事业的经费还不在内。而且，这几年来，政府还花了四万多元来扩建学校，用二万多元新建一个文化站。特别是补助大笔款项来兴修了许多水利，单是石牌大堤就补助了二十四万元之巨。在这样对比面前，农民缴纳的公粮是否过重，让罗翼群自己去想想吧！
　　云应霖挑拨离间  污蔑进步分子
    17日中国农工民主党广东省委员会和广州市委员会的委员举行的联席会议，批驳了云应霖、罗翼群等人的反社会主义言论，并同声谴责章伯钧等人的反社会主义言论，一致要求章伯钧向全体农工民主党的成员检讨。农工民主党广东省委委员、广州市委员会副主任委员梅日新在会上批驳云应霖的错误思想。他说，根据当时海南人民代表周发辉发言的材料，海南农民收入是逐年增长的，购买力也有所上升，全区1954年购买力为二亿八千八百万元，1956年达到三亿元以上。梅日新说，仅此一点也就说明农民的生活是逐年获得改善的。云应霖所谓“海南农民生活太苦了”、“不如解放前”，是主观片面、闭着眼睛不看事实的说法，只是替少数人叫嚣，同罗翼群是一唱一和。他还指出把进步分子都当作挑拨离间、逢迎拍马的人，这是对党和非党进步分子极大的诬蔑，其目的是想离间党与非党进步分子的关系，使一些右派分子借着“民主党派组织独立”的幌子，反对党的领导，把民主党派的工作拉向后退。当然人民是不会容许的。
　　政府兴修水利大大减少了自然灾害
    在18日民革广东省和广州市委会召开的座谈会上，民革成员、省民政厅副厅长何宝松在发言中列举事实说明，罗翼群的说法是毫无根据的。他说：解放以来，政府在农村兴办了许多基本建设，全省兴修的水利受益的耕地面积有三千四百万亩，减少旱地三百万亩，造护林一百万亩，大大减少了自然灾害，成灾比例从1949年解放初期的60％到70％降为1954年的30％到40％，改变了历史上是严重灾区的面貌。他举例说：过去是多灾多难的鉴江平原（包括吴川、茂名、化县等县），单在1955年，政府就拨出专款二百五十万元，派出大批技术人员进行水利、林业、农业的综合勘察，做出全面规划。从茂名县龙首乡到化县谢拍乡一带的七个乡建立了灌溉工程，从此摆脱了旱灾的威胁，去年增产一倍。过去曾流传所谓“有女不嫁谢拍乡”，但今天谢拍乡的情况也改变了。去年谢拍乡获得大丰收，全乡添置新衣五千多件，入学儿童增加了，结婚的人越来越多了。
    他说：但是，解放前的情况是怎样的呢？1943年广东旱灾比1955年轻，但当时沿海一带饿死的人无法计算，有人说是一百万人，单是惠来一县就饿死二万多人。以富裕闻名全国的台山、顺德县，灾后人口也大大减少了。
　　生产不断增长农民负担逐年减轻
    民革广东省委员会委员秦元邦质问罗翼群究竟是站在什么立场说话？他说，罗翼群的说法是代表那些过去蒋介石时代骑在人民头上的人的意见。那些人现在不能像过去那样享受了，就写信给罗翼群诉苦。这就是罗翼群说“人民生活到了饿死边缘”一说的所谓根据。秦元邦根据现在梅县的情况说：旧社会时梅县缺粮也很厉害，我是吃粥长大的，而现在呢，我家还有侄儿等，他们都吃上白米饭。像这样的农民是不少的，这怎能说生活没有改善呢？
    在中共广东省委统战部举行的民主人士座谈会上，省农业厅副厅长谭冬菁用事实驳了罗翼群说税收过重的谬论。他说我们的税收是否过重呢？以农业税来说吧！在农业生产不断增长的情况下，农民负担的农业税是逐年下降的，1951年农民负担的农业税占农业收入的15.44％；1952年降为12.3％；1953年降为11.43％；1954年为12.43％（因为加征支援灾区附加粮九千五百万斤）；1955年降为10.89％；1956年降为7.96％，而且自从1956年起，增产不增税。这怎能说重呢？
　　右派分子还没有投降缴械  阶级斗争在继续展开
    在社会舆论的斥责下，各民主党派的进步势力已开始抬头。他们纷纷起来批驳右派分子的反动言论，要求跟右派分子划清界限。中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志在本月19日举行的有党内外一千多人参加的报告会上，对党外人士的善意批评，表示诚恳接受和衷心感谢，同时他说目前极少数右派分子反社会主义的谬论，已变成当前整风运动发展道路上最大的障碍，他号召一切进步人士回击右派分子疯狂的进攻，保证运动的健康发展。
    值得注意的是：右派分子虽然遭受了初步的回击，但他们并没有投降缴械，其中有的假做检讨，企图蒙混过关，有的耍赖，否认以前说过的话，有的下乡“调查材料，搜集根据”，准备再战。显然，跟右派分子的思想斗争，是一场严重的阶级斗争，看来，还不是一时可以结束的。
