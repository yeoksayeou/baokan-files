Small Trough Feeding, Integration of Raising and Use, Skinny Cattle Become Fat
Xinyang Prefectural Committee Finds the Fundamental Link to Reverse the Weak and Dying Situation of Draught Animals Through Careful Investigation

(Reported by this newspaper) The Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province and its subordinate county committees dispatched livestock investigation teams in April of this year. The results of the investigation in fifty-three agricultural cooperatives in the rice-growing areas, mountainous areas in northern Henan, and plains areas of this region prove that under the current circumstances, the adoption of small trough feeding and the integration of raising and using livestock by agricultural cooperatives is the fundamental link to solving the problem of weak and dying livestock.

According to this investigation in fifty-three cooperatives, there are currently three main methods of livestock feeding and management: centralized feeding (twenty-seven cooperatives, four thousand four hundred and forty-six head of livestock, accounting for 64.14% of the total number of livestock); decentralized feeding to households (nine teams, four hundred and seventy-five head of livestock, accounting for 6.85% of the total number of livestock); small trough feeding and integration of raising and use (twenty-six cooperatives, two thousand and ten head of livestock, accounting for 29% of the total number of livestock). After investigation and discussions, it was unanimously agreed that as long as the leadership attaches importance to livestock feeding and management, carefully selects good feeders, and has sound and reasonable breeding, feeding, use, and reward/punishment systems, it is entirely possible to manage livestock well, regardless of which method is adopted.

However, under the current circumstances where most cooperatives have only been established for a year and lack the conditions for centralized feeding, it is not suitable for centralized feeding. With the exception of a very small number of old cooperatives, the vast majority of new cooperatives only have experience in decentralized feeding by farmers, but lack experience in centralized feeding. In addition, the leadership also lacks experience, and the first year after cooperativization was hit by natural disasters, and the selection of feeders was inappropriate, etc. This has brought many difficulties to collective feeding: 1. Crowded livestock sheds, prone to disease; 2. Uneven size of livestock, different eating speeds, inadequate care; 3. High expenses, large waste, farmers' original furniture and auxiliary feed cannot be used; 4. Difficult to combine use and feeding; 5. Feeders are irresponsible and even steal grass and feed. Therefore, it has resulted in the phenomenon of weak and dying livestock, low reproduction rates, and high costs.

Conversely, under the current circumstances, the adoption of small trough feeding and integration of raising and use makes it easier to overcome the difficulties brought about by the above-mentioned collective feeding. Specifically, the implementation of small trough feeding and integration of raising and use has five major advantages: 1. It can resolve the contradiction between the individual interests of the feeder and the collective interests of the cooperative. In order for the livestock to work and earn points, the feeder must first feed the livestock well; at the same time, in order to keep the draught animals strong, it is necessary to pay attention to appropriate rest during use. The results of doing so benefit both the cooperative and the feeder, thus greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the feeder. 2. Whoever feeds it uses it, and can be used according to physical condition, thus avoiding the phenomenon of physical damage caused by excessive use. 3. Small trough feeding is easy to manage, there are fewer livestock, and the work is not too heavy, so effort can be put into feeding the livestock well; at the same time, it is possible to understand the characteristics of each livestock, and if it gets sick, it can be discovered and treated in time. 4. The farmer's original tools for feeding livestock and auxiliary feed can be used, thereby reducing costs. 5. After adopting small trough feeding and integration of raising and use and implementing contracts, the responsibility is clear if problems occur, which is conducive to the implementation of reward and punishment systems.

Because the method of small trough feeding and integration of raising and use has many advantages, the phenomenon of weak and dying livestock rarely occurs in agricultural cooperatives that adopt this method, and reproduction is also faster. Taking Yangdian Township in Suiping County as an example: After cooperativization, several cooperatives in this township initially adopted the method of small trough feeding and integration of raising and use. As a result, with the exception of normal deaths and those that should be eliminated, abnormal deaths are rare, and the livestock have maintained their original condition. At the same time, livestock reproduction is also increasing year by year. Furthermore, taking Yangtun Team of the "May Second" Cooperative in Shangcai County as an example: The livestock in this team were originally fed centrally, and many died. They learned their lesson and immediately changed from centralized feeding to small trough feeding. As a result, the deaths stopped, the trend of weakness was reversed, and the livestock in the entire team gradually gained weight. From the perspective of breeding young animals, according to a survey of thirteen cooperatives in six counties including Suiping, Queshan, and Xincai, a total of seventy-nine young animals were bred in the spring, of which sixty-seven were bred by small trough feeding, and only a few were bred by centralized feeding.

    小槽喂养　养用合一　瘦牛变肥
    信阳地委经过仔细调查找出扭转耕畜瘦弱死亡局面的根本环节
    本报讯　中共河南省信阳地委及所属县委，于今年4月间派出的牲畜调查工作组，在这个地区的水稻区、淮北山区、平原区的五十三个农业社调查的结果证明：在目前情况下，农业社采用小槽喂养和养用合一的办法，是解决牲畜瘦弱死亡的根本环节。
    据这次在五十三个社中的调查，目前牲畜饲养管理方式，主要有三种：集中喂养（二十七个社，四千四百四十六头牲畜，占总牲畜头数的64.14％）；分散喂养到户（九个队，四百七十五头牲畜，占牲畜总头数的6.85％）；小槽喂养、养用合一（二十六个社，二千零一十头牲畜，占牲畜总头数的29％）。经过调查和会议讨论的结果，一致认为：只要领导上重视牲畜的饲养管理工作，认真挑选好饲养员，有健全的合理的各种繁殖、饲养、役使以及奖惩制度，不论采取那一种办法，都完全可以把牲畜饲养管理好。
    但是，在目前大多数合作社刚办一年，还缺乏集中喂养的条件下，是不适宜集中喂养的。除极少数老社外，绝大部分新社，实际上农民只有分散喂养的经验，而没有集中喂养的经验，加以领导上也因为缺乏经验，以及合作化后第一年又遭受到自然灾害的袭击，饲养员又选择不当等等，这就给集体喂养带来了如下许多困难：一、畜舍拥挤，易于发生疾病；二、牲口大小不一，吃草有快慢，照顾不周；三、开支多，浪费大，农民原有家具和辅助饲料不能利用；四、使、喂不易结合；五、饲养员不负责任，还偷草偷料。因此，造成了牲畜瘦弱多、死亡多、繁殖少、成本高的现象。
    相反的，在目前情况下，采用小槽喂养和养用合一的办法，就易于克服以上集体喂养带来的困难。具体的来说，实行小槽喂养和养用合一办法，有五大好处，即：一、可以解决饲养员个人利益和社的集体利益的矛盾。饲养员为了让牲口干活挣分，就必须先把牲口喂养好；同时，为了使耕畜经常保持体强力壮，又必须在使用时注意适当休息，这样作的结果，对社、对饲养员都有好处，因而也就大大激发了饲养员的积极性。二、谁喂谁使，可以根据体质情况役使，这样就避免了役使过重而造成体质损伤的现象发生。三、小槽喂养便于管理，牲口少、费工不大，可以下工夫把牲口喂好；同时还可以了解到每头牲口的特点，就是得了病，也可以及时发现及时治疗。四、可以利用农民原有的喂养牲口的工具及辅助饲料，从而降低了成本。五、采用小槽喂养和养用合一，实行包干后，再发生问题，也责任明确，这就便于奖惩制度的贯彻执行。
    由于小槽喂养和养用合一的办法有许多好处，在采取这一方式的农业社里，不仅牲畜瘦弱死亡的现象很少发生，而且繁殖的也快。以遂平县杨店乡为例：这个乡在合作化后，有几个社一开始就采用了小槽喂养和养用合一的办法，结果除了正常死亡和应当淘汰的以外，非正常的死亡现象是个别的，而且牲口一直保持着原来的膘情，同时牲口繁殖也是逐年上升的；再以上蔡县“五二”社的杨屯队为例：这个队的牲口原来是集中喂养的，死得很多，他们记取了教训，回过头来立即由集中喂养改变为小槽喂养，结果停止了死亡现象，扭转了瘦弱上升的局面，全队牲口逐渐上膘了。从繁殖幼畜来看，据遂平、确山、新蔡等六个县十三个社的调查，春季共繁殖幼畜七十九头，其中就有六十七头是小槽喂养繁殖出来的，只有几头是集中喂养繁殖出来的。
