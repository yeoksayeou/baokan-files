Practicing Diligence and Thrift in Managing Households, Serving Socialism

The First National Conference of Representatives of Workers' Family Members, based on the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift and the experience of workers' family work over the past few years, has determined that the basic task of the current national workers' family work is: to educate workers' family members, raise awareness, strengthen unity, implement the "Five Goods" (good at managing households diligently and thriftily, good at unity and mutual assistance, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, good at studying hard), and serve socialism.

Our country's socialist construction has already achieved great successes. However, because our country's original economic foundation was very poor, coupled with a large population and relatively little cultivated land, our country is still an economically and culturally relatively backward country. Under these circumstances, our country's socialist construction will inevitably encounter many difficulties. The lives of our people, including the lives of the vast majority of workers, cannot be improved too quickly. This is the reason why the whole country must adhere to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift.

In order to build the country through diligence and thrift, every worker, farmer, intellectual, and industrialist and businessman in the country should work together to develop production and conserve consumption. In this regard, every worker's family in the country should first play an exemplary role. Because when every family lives a good life, things will be easier for everything from a factory and a region to the entire country. When the country is well-built, families that are still in difficulty for the time being will gradually improve. That is to say, building the country well, running the factory well, and living a good life for the family are closely linked.

We know that neither grain nor cloth will fall from the sky; they are both products of labor. To live a good life, we can only rely on our own two hands. Hands can cook, make clothes, and make shoes; hands plus machines can make even more things. If 600 million hands of the people across the country work diligently and thriftily, the country can become prosperous and strong, and families can live well. Therefore, practicing diligence and thrift in managing households is for the purpose of building the country through diligence and thrift, and for building a socialist happy life. The most important help that workers' family members can give to workers and to the cause of socialist construction is to manage household affairs well with the spirit of diligence and thrift. Household labor is also a part of social labor; doing household labor well can make family life happy and improve workers' enthusiasm for production, which is also serving socialism.

It is entirely possible for workers' family members to rely on their own strength to run various welfare undertakings. Over the past few years, workers' family members in various places have already run many welfare undertakings. For example, in places where the supply of non-staple foods is insufficient, they grow their own vegetables and raise pigs; in places with many children, they run their own kindergartens and nurseries; when children cannot go to school, they automatically hire teachers and raise funds to establish children's tutoring classes; in places where housing is lacking, they rely on the strength of the masses to build houses themselves. In addition, there are various economic or labor mutual aid organizations. The establishment of these collective undertakings has boosted the production enthusiasm of workers, strengthened the unity of workers' families, reduced the burden on the state, and established a new social atmosphere. This situation shows that some of the difficulties in workers' families can be resolved through the efforts of the workers' family members themselves. This method of uniting and helping each other with one's own labor and collective strength to run collective welfare undertakings is a socialist method that can be universally promoted.

Workers' family members are part of the working class. During the difficult days when the working class in our country led the people of the whole country in carrying out the new democratic revolution, workers' family members also suffered hardships and contributed their efforts, and many family members' relatives sacrificed their lives for the revolution. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, workers' family members have not only actively participated in various political struggles, but also encouraged their husbands to do a good job in production, practice diligence and thrift in managing households, and educate their children, and have also done much beneficial work. Many workers' family members understand that their hard work is not only for today, but also for tomorrow, for socialism.

There are more than 60 million workers' family members across the country, which is a large contingent. This contingent needs to be organized, and this work is still just beginning. In some new industrial areas and new factories and mines, workers' family work is still a blank spot. This shows that family organizations are extremely uncommon. To do a good job in family work, it is necessary to establish and improve organizations and strengthen leadership. Over the past few years, hundreds of thousands of activists have emerged among workers' family members. They do not fear hardship, do not seek rewards, and enthusiastically serve the masses and contribute their strength and wisdom to national construction. This is commendable. However, at present, some grassroots party organizations and trade unions often emphasize that they are busy with work, or are afraid of trouble, and do not care about family work; they also rarely help and cultivate family activists. It should be pointed out that family work is an important part of the party's mass work, and neglecting workers' family work is neglecting an important aspect of workers' lives. Party organizations at all levels, especially grassroots party organizations, must strengthen their leadership over workers' family work, urge trade union organizations to frequently go deep into workers' families to understand the situation, listen to the reports of family committees, frequently discuss workers' family work, help and cultivate activists among workers' family members, and absorb outstanding members of them into the party to become the core force in family work.

### 勤俭持家，为社会主义服务

　　勤俭持家，为社会主义服务
    全国第一次职工家属代表会议，根据勤俭建国的方针和几年来职工家属工作的经验，确定当前全国职工家属工作的基本任务是：教育职工家属群众，提高觉悟，加强团结，贯彻“五好”（勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养儿女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好），为社会主义服务。
    我国的社会主义建设已经取得了巨大成就。但是，由于我们的国家原有的经济基础很差，加上人口众多，耕地较少，因此，我国至今还是一个经济和文化比较落后的国家。在这种情况下，我们国家的社会主义建设不可避免地遇到许多困难。我国人民的生活，包括广大职工的生活，就不能过快地改善。这就是为什么全国上下必须坚持勤俭建国方针的理由。
    为了勤俭建国，全国每一个工人、农民、知识分子、工商业者都应该同心协力，发展生产，节约消费。在这一方面，全国每一个职工的家庭首先应该发挥模范作用。因为每个家庭日子过好了，小至一个工厂一个地区，大至国家，也就好办事。国家建设好了，暂时还有困难的家庭也会逐渐好起来。这就是说，把国家建设好，把工厂办好，把家庭的日子过好，这三者是密切联系在一起的。
    我们知道，粮食和布匹都不会从天上掉下来，都是劳动的产物。要过好日子，只有靠自己的一双手。手可以做饭，做衣服、做鞋子，手加机器就能做出更多的东西来。全国人民六亿双手都勤俭劳动，国家才能富强，家庭才能过好。所以勤俭持家就是为了勤俭建国，就是为了建设社会主义的幸福生活。职工家属对职工、对社会主义建设事业最重要的帮助，就是以勤俭持家的精神来搞好家务。家务劳动也就是社会劳动的一部分；做好家务劳动，可以使家庭生活愉快，提高职工的生产积极性，这也就是为社会主义服务。
    职工家属依靠自己的力量举办各种福利事业是完全可能的。几年来各地职工家属已经举办了许多福利事业。比如，在副食品供应不足的地方，她们就自己种菜、养猪；在孩子多的地方，她们自己举办了幼儿园、托儿站；在孩子不能升学的时候，她们自动聘请教员，筹措经费，成立了儿童补习班；在房子缺乏的地方，她们依靠群众的力量，自己动手修盖房屋。此外，还有各色各样经济的或劳力的互助组织。由于这些集体事业的举办，鼓舞了职工的生产情绪，加强了职工家庭的团结，减轻了国家的负担，树立了新的社会风气。这种情况说明，职工家庭中的一些困难，通过职工家属自己的努力是可以解决的。这种以自己的劳动和共同的力量，团结互助，举办集体福利事业的办法，是可以普遍推行的社会主义的方法。
    职工家属是工人阶级的一部分。在我国工人阶级领导全国人民进行新民主主义革命的艰苦日子里，职工家属同样受了苦，出了力，有不少家属的亲人是为革命而牺牲的。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，职工家属们一方面积极地参加了各种政治斗争，一方面鼓励丈夫搞好生产、勤俭持家、教养子女，也做了许多有益的工作。许多职工家属都懂得，她们的艰苦奋斗不只是为了今天，也是为了明天，为了社会主义。
    全国职工家属约有六千多万，是一支大队伍。这个队伍需要组织起来，而这个工作现在还在开始。某些新工业区、新厂矿，职工家属工作还是空白点。这说明家属组织是极不普遍的。要把家属工作做好，必须建立和健全组织和加强领导。几年来，职工家属中间已经涌现了几十万积极分子，他们不辞劳苦，不图报酬，热情地为群众服务、为国家建设贡献出自己的力量和智慧，这是值得表扬的。但是，目前有某些基层党组织和工会往往强调工作忙，或者怕麻烦，不管家属工作；对于家属积极分子也很少帮助和培养。应该指出：家属工作是党的群众工作的一个重要组成部分，忽视职工家属工作就是忽视职工生活的一个重要方面。各级党组织特别是基层党组织，要加强对职工家属工作的领导，督促工会组织经常深入到职工家属中去了解情况，听取家属委员会的报告，经常讨论职工家属工作，帮助和培养职工家属中的积极分子，并且把她们中的优秀分子吸收到党内来，成为家属工作中的核心力量。
