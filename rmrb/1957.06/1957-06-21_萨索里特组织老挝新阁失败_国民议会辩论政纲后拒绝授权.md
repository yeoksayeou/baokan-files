Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 20th: Vientiane dispatch: Prince Souphanouvong, chairman of the Lao National Party, who was entrusted with forming a cabinet, presented a new cabinet list to the Lao National Assembly on the morning of the 19th and delivered a policy address.

According to the list of cabinet members proposed by Souphanouvong, Souphanouvong would serve as Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Social Welfare, and Propaganda; former Prime Minister Prince Phouma would serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Religious Affairs; and Ma Sananikone, leader of the Independent Party, would serve as Minister of Defense.

According to this cabinet list, the eleven cabinet members included six members of the National Party, three members of the Independent Party, and two non-partisans.

Since being entrusted with forming a cabinet on June 3rd, Souphanouvong has encountered great difficulties in his efforts and has repeatedly postponed the date of submitting the cabinet list because the Independent Party demanded the position of Deputy Prime Minister and half of the ministerial positions equivalent to those obtained by the National Party, and demanded a new platform jointly drafted by the National Party and the Independent Party. During this period, the statement of authorization issued by Souphanouvong after being entrusted with forming the cabinet caused opposition from some people, who believed that the statement "has an overly uncompromising nature toward Laos."

In his policy address to the National Assembly on the 19th, Souphanouvong said that his cabinet would strive for harmony and coordination among all Laotians in order to achieve the final unification of the country. He also stated that the new cabinet "will implement the cause undertaken by the previous government."

Souphanouvong pointed out that he would continue negotiations with the Lao Fighting Units in accordance with the Geneva Accords. However, Souphanouvong also criticized the Lao Fighting Units in his speech and reiterated that "the Royal Government is an indivisible whole and power cannot be entrusted to others." Souphanouvong also stipulated a two-month deadline to reach an agreement with the Lao Fighting Units. He said that after this deadline, continued negotiations would be futile.

The National Assembly has decided to debate the policy address proposed by Souphanouvong on the 20th and vote on whether to accept the new cabinet list.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 20th: Vientiane dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Prince Souphanouvong, who was ordered to form a cabinet, failed in the authorization vote in the National Assembly today.

Souphanouvong presented his cabinet list to the National Assembly yesterday, requesting authorization. According to the new Lao Constitution, the authorization vote of the National Assembly requires a two-thirds majority. In today's vote, eighteen votes supported Souphanouvong, eight votes opposed, and two abstained.

　　萨索里特组织老挝新阁失败
    国民议会辩论政纲后拒绝授权
    新华社河内20日电　万象消息：受命组阁的老挝国家党主席卡代·萨索里特19日上午向老挝国民议会提出新的内阁名单，并且发表了施政纲领。
    根据萨索里特提出的内阁成员名单，萨索里特将担任首相兼内政、社会福利和宣传部大臣；前任首相富马亲王担任外交、司法和宗教事务部大臣；独立党的领袖马·萨纳尼空担任国防部大臣。
    根据这一项内阁名单，内阁成员的十一人包括六名国家党党员、三名独立党党员和两名无党派人士。
    萨索里特在6月3日受命组阁以后，由于独立党人要求占有副首相和相当于国家党所得部长席位的一半席位，并且要求一个由国家党人和独立党人共同拟定的新政纲，因而使得组阁工作遭遇了很大的困难，并且一再推迟提出内阁名单的日期。在这期间，萨索里特在受命组阁后发表的授权声明曾经引起某些人的反对，这些人士认为这个声明“具有一种对寮国过分不妥协的性质”。
    萨索里特在19日向国民议会发表的施政纲领中说，他的内阁将争取全体老挝人的和睦协调，以求实现国家的最后统一。他并且表示新内阁“将贯彻执行前任政府所从事的事业”。
    萨索里特指出，他将依据日内瓦协定继续与寮国战斗部队谈判。但是萨索里特在演说中又对寮国战斗部队进行抨击，并且重申“王国政府是一个不可分裂的整体，权力不能托付给别人”。萨索里特还规定两个月的期限来同寮国战斗部队达成协议。他说，过了这个期限，继续谈判将是无益的。
    国民议会已经决定在20日就萨索里特提出的施政纲领进行辩论，并且投票决定是否接受新内阁名单。
    新华社河内20日电　万象消息：奉命组阁的老挝首相卡代·萨索里特今天在国民议会的授权投票中失败。
    萨索里特在昨天向国民议会提出了他的内阁名单，要求授权。按照老挝的新宪法，国民议会的授权投票需要获得三分之二的多数。在今天的投票中，十八票支持萨索里特，八票反对，两票弃权。
