Xinhua News Agency, 31st - At the invitation of the "Liberation Army Daily," more than a dozen people from the capital's literary and art circles and military writers held a symposium yesterday. Those present focused on criticizing the phenomena and shortcomings of dogmatism and sectarianism in military literary and art work, and unanimously agreed that they should immediately start dismantling walls, filling ditches, and breaking through the shackles of dogmatism to push the motherland's literary and artistic endeavors to new heights.

Zhang Guangnian, editor-in-chief of "Literary Gazette," spoke first, believing that the leading comrades of the General Political Department's Cultural Department had sectarian sentiments. He said, "I once frankly mentioned to Comrade Chen Yi that I felt he had sectarian sentiments in his work." Zhang Guangnian cited facts to illustrate that leaders of military literary and art work were unwilling to listen to unpleasant words. When they heard opinions that were inconsistent with their own on certain issues or works, they easily became agitated and angry, giving people the impression that they were untouchable. Therefore, many people had endless worries when approaching and evaluating the works of military authors. Tang Yin of "Literary Gazette" believed that in his contact with military comrades, he felt that there were "walls" and "ditches" present. He said that in the past, "Literary Gazette" had organized a discussion on writing about new heroic figures, in which it criticized some improper arguments made by military comrades, which caused a great uproar. The military specifically convened a symposium to sternly refute Comrade Feng Xuefeng, the editor-in-chief of "Literary Gazette" at the time, putting great pressure on them. They felt that the military lacked the spirit of free discussion of academic issues and could only keep their distance. Writer Gong Liu believed that the commonly used term "military writer" in the past was inappropriate, and there was no need to divide the literary and art circles into "military" and "local." In fact, non-military writers are also very willing to engage with military themes. He believed that someone's proposal to organize branches of the Writers Association in the military was absurd. Writer Hu Ke also believed in his speech that it was wrong for the leadership in the past to forbid writers in the army from publishing opinions on academic issues that differed from the leadership's outside the army, the so-called "unified language." Yu Ji, director of the General Political Department's Creation Office, believed that sectarian sentiments did exist and that this criticism should be bravely accepted, and that they should immediately start "dismantling walls" and "filling ditches" from within the military.

At the symposium, many people's speeches also focused on criticizing the dogmatism in the leadership of military literary and art work and in literary criticism. Zhang Guangnian believed that the creative potential of the military was very strong, but this potential had not been fully realized, mainly because the people who guided the literary and art work were ideologically backward. They did not see the development of literary and art work and the improvement of readers' appreciation level in recent years, and their guiding principles were still stuck in the situation they were in several years ago. Yu Ji and Chen Feiqin, the editor-in-chief of "Liberation Army Literature," both criticized some articles by Chen Yi, Chen Huangmei, and others that guided military literary and art work, saying that they contained many dogmatic viewpoints. Yu Ji believed that dogmatism in military literary criticism and the ideological guidance of literary and art creation had fostered formulaic and conceptualized literary creation. There were many rules and regulations about what to write, what not to write, and how to write, which restricted the development of creation. Chen Feiqin believed that some leaders often used general political principles and concepts to guide the creation and criticism of works, which brought many damages to creation. He said that dogmatism, especially when combined with leadership authority, was even more harmful. He believed that it was necessary to focus on analyzing Chen Yi's writings on guiding creation because these arguments had long been combined with administrative orders and had a great impact on the military. Yu Ji also believed that it was necessary to clarify many dogmatic understandings in the ideological guidance of creation, lift many rules and regulations, and resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

In their speeches, many people also criticized the phenomenon of some people who did not understand literature and art interfering with literary and art work with a crude attitude. Many people also criticized some articles written by Zhang Liyun when talking about literary criticism work. Zhang Liyun also believed in his speech that his writings had many one-sided and dogmatic aspects. Zhang Liyun believed that the reason for the emergence of dogmatism was that literary and art work was simply equated with political work, and the method of logical thinking was used to demand image thinking.

    首都文艺界人士和部队作家举行座谈
    批评部队文艺工作领导者的缺点
    新华社31日讯　应解放军报的邀请，昨天十几位首都文艺界人士和部队作家举行座谈会。到会的人着重对部队文艺工作中的教条主义和宗派主义的现象和缺点，进行了批评，并且一致认为，应该立即动手拆墙、平沟和冲破教条主义的束缚，把祖国的文学艺术事业，推向新的高峰。
    文艺报总编辑张光年首先发言，他认为总政文化部领导同志有宗派主义的情绪。他说，我曾经很直率地向陈沂同志提过，我感到他在工作中有宗派主义情绪。张光年列举事实说明，部队文艺工作领导者听不进逆耳之言，听到和他们对某些问题或作品不一致的意见时，很容易激动、发火，给人以惹不得的感觉。因此，使很多人在接触和评价部队作者的作品时，有无穷的忧虑。文艺报唐因认为，在他和部队同志接触中，感到这里是有“墙”有“沟”存在的。他说，过去文艺报曾经组织过一次关于写新英雄人物的讨论，其中批评了部队某些同志立论不妥之处，引起了轩然大波。部队专门召集了一次座谈会，对当时文艺报主编冯雪峰等同志严词驳斥，给人压力很大，感到部队缺乏自由探讨学术问题的精神，只有敬而远之。作家公刘认为，过去习惯用的“部队作家”的字眼就是不确当的，没有必要把文艺界分为“部队的”或“地方的”。实际上，军外作家也是很愿意接触军事题材的。他认为有人主张组织部队的作家协会分会是荒谬的。作家胡可也在发言中认为，过去领导上不准军队内的作家在学术性问题上，在军外发表和领导上不同的意见，所谓“语言统一”，这是不对的。总政治部创作室主任虞棘认为，宗派主义情绪是确实有的，应该勇敢接受这个批评，并且立即从部队开始，动手“拆墙”、“平沟”。
    在座谈会上，许多人的发言，还集中地批评了部队文艺工作领导上和文艺批评工作中的教条主义。张光年认为，部队的创作潜力是很雄厚的，但这种潜力未能充分发挥出来，主要是指导文艺的人思想落后了。他们看不到几年来文艺工作的发展和读者欣赏水平的提高，他们的指导方针还停留在若干年前所处的情况。虞棘和解放军文艺主编陈斐琴都在发言中，批评陈沂、陈荒煤等人的指导部队文艺工作的一些文章，有许多教条主义的观点。虞棘认为，部队文艺批评和文艺创作指导思想上的教条主义，助长了文艺创作中的公式化、概念化。要写什么，不要写什么，怎么写，都有许多清规戒律，限制创作的发展。陈斐琴认为，一些领导人，常常用一般政治原则和概念来指导创作和批评作品，对创作带来了许多损害。他说，教条主义，特别是当它一旦和领导权威相结合，其为害就更大了。他认为着重分析一下陈沂关于指导创作的著作很有必要。因为这些论点，长期结合着行政命令，对部队影响很大。虞棘也认为必须澄清创作指导思想上的许多教条主义认识，解除许多清规戒律，坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针。
    许多人在发言中，还对一些不懂文艺而采取粗暴的态度干涉文艺工作的现象，提出了批评。也有许多人在谈到文艺评论工作时，批评了张立云所写的一些文章。张立云在会上发言时也认为，他写的东西是存在着许多片面性和教条主义的。张立云认为，产生教条主义的原因，是把文艺工作仅仅等同于政治工作，用逻辑思维的方法去要求形象思维。
