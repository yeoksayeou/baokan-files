    What are the Internal Contradictions Within State Organs?
    Gan Cisen, Central Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Assistant Minister of Supervision

    Since the Party's Rectification Campaign began, non-Party figures from all sectors have actively criticized the shortcomings in the Party's work and the ideological style of Party members, fulfilling their responsibility as "frank friends" to help the Party's Rectification Campaign. I believe that this is a major event in contemporary political life! We fully believe that the result of the Rectification will not be "a complete mess," but rather a new, consolidated, and unprecedented great unity of people from all strata of society on a socialist foundation. A rich and colorful new era of socialist democracy is about to arrive!

    State Organs Are Not Calm Seas and Stagnant Water

    However, many of our friends, especially many Party members, do not yet fully understand this significance. Currently, the Rectification Campaign is progressing better in schools and cultural and educational departments, and relatively lagging behind in general state organs. Many friends working in state organs have said to me: "Things are calm and quiet here, like stagnant water!" It is said that the leading comrades of some organ Party committees are closing their doors and exploring "internal contradictions," afraid to boldly release them to the masses for deliberation. Some have also managed to grasp the main contradictions and formulated plans. But what are these "main contradictions"? It turns out that they are just some difficult problems in business that have not been resolved for a long time. They dare not touch the internal contradictions of the organs, or dare not raise them to a more important position. Some, although they have mobilized the masses and made reports, are acting awkwardly, full of worry, and dare not let go. Therefore, many middle and lower-level cadres reflect: "We have been raising opinions every year, and this time is nothing more than the same old thing." Everyone lacks confidence and expresses indifference and wait-and-see attitudes towards the movement.

    Are there no major internal contradictions in state organs? I don't think that's the case. There are many serious problems between leaders and those being led, between Party members and the masses. It's just that the cadres of state organs are not as good at writing articles and making loud noises as scholars and professors; or even if they can write and shout, they don't have the time to write and the place to shout, and the newspapers don't pay enough attention to them, so the contradictions have not been exposed.

    Here, I would like to talk about a few relatively common problems.

    In the work of state organs, the situation of "the Party substituting for the government" and "failure to separate the Party and the government" often occurs. I think this is not good. The result of "the Party substituting for the government" will be to reduce the Party's leadership and supervisory role, damage the prestige of the government, and weaken the enthusiasm of state organ staff. But some Party members do not understand this principle. For example, when some Party members make mistakes and make self-criticisms, they say: "I attach importance to the Party's instructions, but I am not so concerned about the government's resolutions and orders." They think they are very loyal to the Party. Of course, it is good to be loyal to the Party, but they do not understand that doing so is objectively detrimental to the Party. I think this is an ideological source of "the Party substituting for the government."

    Criticizing "the Party substituting for the government" should not negate the Party's specific leadership

    The reasons for the emergence of "the Party substituting for the government" must also be sought from the way the Party leads state organs and the working system of state organs. We sincerely support the Party's leadership and firmly believe that without the Party's leadership, nothing can be accomplished in our country's various tasks. However, the current way the Party leads state organs must be improved in order to fully utilize the functions of state organs and mobilize the enthusiasm of state organ staff.

    The performance of the Party groups of state organs "substituting for the government" generally takes two forms. One is that the Party group directly comes out to issue orders. Although this situation does not occur frequently, it is not accidental. A more common phenomenon is that the Party group's decisions are not consulted with non-Party responsible cadres before or after the fact, and are directly implemented through their own Party members. As far as my own feeling in working in state organs is concerned, this was very serious in the past, and has changed greatly since last year. But no specific methods have been worked out to consolidate it as a working system of state organs.

    Currently, many of our friends criticize the problem of "the Party substituting for the government," and their intentions are good. However, there are also a few opinions that, although expressed very implicitly, essentially want to negate the Party's specific leadership of state organs. I think this is somewhat of a manifestation of nostalgia for bourgeois democratic thought. All of us truly patriotic intellectuals can recognize and support the socialist future of our country, and any thought that wants to fundamentally negate the Party's leading role is wrong. While we criticize the shortcomings of the Party's work, we must also criticize our own bourgeois democratic thought, so that we can help ourselves while helping the Party's Rectification Campaign.

    The problem of "having a position but no authority" should be specifically analyzed

    In state organs, there is indeed still the problem of non-Party leading cadres "having a position but no authority." I think this issue should not be generalized. If it is generalized, neither side will be convinced. Because of my work, I often travel to various places these past few years, and I have the most contact with some middle and upper-level cadres (Party members and non-Party members) working in state organs and enterprises. I have paid attention to this issue. I think, so-called having a position but no authority, there are probably the following situations:

    1. There are indeed still some Party members with bad ideological styles. They do not implement the Party's policies, do not understand the principle of cooperating with non-Party cadres, and adopt an incorrect attitude of discrimination, coldness, and even exclusion towards non-Party cadres (especially leading cadres). I think this situation is in the minority.

    2. Due to the problem of "failure to separate the Party and the government" and "the Party substituting for the government" not being well resolved, some non-Party cadres neither see relevant important documents nor understand the Party group's decisions and intentions, and wanting to "do their duty" and "have authority" is a requirement lacking practical significance.

    3. From the perspective of non-Party cadres, the situation of not doing their duty and not being responsible is also very common. The reasons for this are very complex. Some are because they have too many concurrent positions or too many social activities, and cannot concentrate on one business. Some are because they are old and weak, and cannot do much work. There are indeed also some people who take advantage of a gap in the midst of the confusion and enjoy some "leisure." In addition to this, it may seem a bit "dogmatic," but to do a good job in the people's cause, it is really not an easy thing. You must have a little business knowledge and a little Marxism-Leninism. And some of our non-Party cadres, including myself, either have only one aspect or neither aspect.

    In the above three situations, a kind of social "public opinion" (or pressure) has formed. An argument that started from somewhere has been widely circulating in our state organs, enterprises, institutions, and schools: "Non-Party leading cadres are not up to the task!" Some young and reckless middle and lower-level cadres (this is not only Party and League members, but also many members of the masses) also want to express this argument in their words and attitudes.

    4. However, there is also a fourth situation. Non-Party cadres are brave to take responsibility, Party member cadres are enthusiastic to help, they care for each other, consult with each other, and handle things smoothly and well. There is no "wall" or "ditch" between them. I think this situation is also only a minority.

    To solve the problem of "having a position but no authority," we must expose all the specific facts in order to see what are the reasons and where the key lies.

    Why can't the Party's policy towards intellectuals be implemented

    Since Premier Zhou made a report on the issue of intellectuals, the Party's policy towards intellectuals has been implemented in all aspects, but in some state organs, it has been implemented very poorly. The leaders of these organs seem to have this view: those engaged in engineering and technology can barely be considered intellectuals; those engaged in social sciences such as literature, history, philosophy, politics, law, and economics are not considered intellectuals. In fact, there are many large and small intellectuals with expertise in state organs. Many of them originally came from classrooms and research rooms. If they "never forget their old profession" and are willing to engage in a little "side business" in addition to doing a good job in their posts, why can't we arrange some conditions for them in work and study? If the intellectuals in schools and research institutions have basically met the requirements of "a room and two books" after Premier Zhou's report, while the intellectuals working in state organs who have the conditions to do some research work have not reached this requirement by far. It is wrong to forget this part of intellectuals. They have more contact with reality than professional researchers. If we mobilize their strength, I think it will help to overcome dogmatism in academic research.

    I work in the Ministry of Supervision. There are many "small" intellectuals in our ministry. In response to the Party's call, in the spring of 1956, they launched a "march towards science." There was also a bit of bias in this upsurge. For example, some were not at ease with their work and were single-mindedly yearning for a "deputy doctor." However, the demands of most young intellectuals were legitimate. They were willing to improve what they had learned in school after doing a good job, or to engage in another science they liked, in short, they wanted to engage in some "side business." The Party organization of the Ministry of Supervision did not seriously study these situations, encourage and practically help the legitimate demands, but came up with a general "criticism." Many young comrades reflected that after listening to a big report made by a leading comrade representing the Party organization, they felt cold all over. This basin of cold water was effective. A year later, in the Ministry of Supervision, no one could hear the voices of young comrades "marching towards science" anymore.

    The Ministry of Supervision has not done a second thing in implementing the Party's policy towards intellectuals other than doing this one thing.

    Can we still say that there are no serious internal problems in our state organs? I believe that all those who sincerely love the Party should dare to expose the shortcomings of the Party and Party members and make well-intentioned criticisms at this time. I am a member of a democratic party and also a cadre of a state organ. I hope that the members of democratic parties in state organs will actively help the Party's Rectification Campaign!

    国家机关中的内部矛盾是什么？
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员监察部部长助理  甘祠森
    自从党的整风运动开始以后，各方面的党外人士都积极起来批评党的工作和党员思想作风上的毛病，帮助党的整风运动，尽到了“诤友”的责任。我认为，这是当代政治生活中的一件大事！我们完全相信，整风的结果，不是“糟得很”，而是全国各阶层人民在社会主义基础上达到一个崭新的、巩固的、空前的大团结。丰富多彩的社会主义民主新时代即将到来！
    国家机关并不是风平浪静死水无波
    但是，我们许多朋友，特别是许多党员同志，对于这个意义还认识不足。目前，整风运动在学校和文教部门开展较好，在一般国家机关显得比较落后。不少在国家机关工作的朋友对我说：“我们这儿是风平浪静，死水无波！”据说，有些机关党委的领导同志正在关着门摸索“内部矛盾”，不敢大胆放手地拿到群众中去酝酿。有些也算摸着了主要矛盾，制订了计划。但这些“主要矛盾”是什么呢？原来只是一些业务上长期不能解决的疑难问题。而对机关内部矛盾不敢接触，或者不敢提到比较重要的地位上来。还有些虽然也算动员了群众，做了报告，但态度是忸忸怩怩，忧心忡忡，不敢放手。因此，许多中下级干部反映：“意见年年提，这次也不过那么一回事。”大家信心不足，对运动表示淡漠和观望。
    国家机关是不是没有什么重大的内部矛盾呢？我看情况不是那样。在领导与被领导之间，在党员与群众之间，存在着不少严重的问题。只是因为，机关干部不像学者教授那么会写文章，会大吵大嚷；或者虽会写会嚷，也没有写的时间和嚷的场所，报纸对他们关心也不够，矛盾没有揭露出来。
    在这里，我想谈几个比较普遍的问题。
    在国家机关工作中，常常出现“以党代政”、“党政不分”的情况。我以为这是不好的。“以党代政”的结果，将是降低党的领导和监督作用，损害政府的威信，削弱国家机关工作人员的积极性。但有些党员同志并不懂得这个道理。例如，某些党员同志在犯错误作检讨的时候，竟这样说：“我对党的指示是重视的，而对政府的决议命令就不那么关心。”自以为对党很忠实。当然，对党忠实是好的，但他们不了解，这样做在客观上是不利于党的。我以为这是产生“以党代政”的一个思想根源。
    批评“以党代政”不应否定党的具体领导
    出现“以党代政”的原因，还要从党领导国家机关的方式方法和国家机关工作制度上去寻找。我们真诚拥护党的领导，深信我们国家各项工作，如果离开了党的领导，将是一事无成。但目前党领导国家机关的方式方法必须改进，才能充分发挥国家机关的职能，调动国家机关工作人员的积极性。
    国家机关党组“以党代政”的表现，一般有两种形式。一种是党组直接出来发号施令。这种情况虽不经常出现，但也并不是偶然的事情。较普遍的现象是，党组的决定，事前事后都不和党外负责干部协商，直接通过自己的党员去贯彻。这种情况，就我自己在国家机关工作的感觉来说，过去十分严重，去年以来，已大有改变。但还没有搞出一些具体办法，作为国家机关的工作制度，把它巩固起来。
    目前我们很多朋友批评“以党代政”的问题，用意都是好的。但也有少数意见，表达虽很含蓄，实质上是要否定党对国家机关的具体领导，我以为这多少是留恋资产阶级民主的思想的流露。我们一切真正爱国的知识分子，都能认清并拥护我们国家的社会主义前途，任何想要根本否定党的领导作用的思想都是错误的。在我们批评党的工作缺点的同时，必须批判我们自己的资产阶级民主思想，这样才能在帮助党的整风运动中同时也帮助了自己。
    “有职无权”的问题应作具体分析
    在国家机关中，的确还存在着非党领导干部“有职无权”的问题。这个问题，我以为不宜笼统的说。笼统的说，哪一方面都不能心服。我因为工作关系，这几年常去各地走走，接触最多的是在国家机关、企业中工作的一些中上级干部（党员和非党员）。我曾留心这个问题。我看，所谓有职无权，大概有这么几种情况：
    一、的确还有一些思想作风都不好的党员，他们不执行党的政策，不懂得必须和非党干部合作共事的道理，对非党干部（特别是领导干部）采取歧视、冷淡甚至排斥的错误态度。我以为这种情况是少数。
    二、由于“党政不分”，“以党代政”的问题没有很好解决，有些非党干部既看不到有关重要文件，也不了解党组的决定和意图，要想做到“尽职”和“有权”，是缺乏实际意义的要求。
    三、从非党干部看，不尽职不尽责的情况也是很普遍的。这方面的原因就很复杂。有的因为兼职过多，或社会活动过多，不能专心搞一项业务。有的因为年老力衰，不能多做工作。的确也还有一些在一片混忙声中，钻个空子，享点“清福”的人。除此以外，说来似乎有点“教条”，要办好人民事业，真的并不是太容易的事，既要有一点业务知识，也要有一点马列主义。而我们有些非党干部，包括我自己在内，或者只有一面，或者两面都没有。
    在上述三种情况下，竟形成了一种社会“舆论”（或者说是压力）。不知从什么地方开始的一种论调，在我们的国家机关、企业、事业、学校中普遍流传：“非党领导干部不顶事！”一些年轻冒失的中下级干部（这倒不只是党团员，群众也很多），还要把这个论调在言语、态度上表现出来。
    四、但是，也还有第四种情况。非党干部勇于负责，党员干部热心帮助，互相关心，互相商量，把事情办得很顺利，很好。他们之间没有“墙”或“沟”。我以为这种情况也只是少数。
    要解决“有职无权”的问题，必须把各项具体事实暴露出来，才能看清有些什么原因，关键在哪里。
    党对知识分子的政策为什么不能贯彻执行
    自从周总理作了关于知识分子问题的报告以后，党对知识分子的政策，各方面都在贯彻执行，而在有些国家机关，却执行得很差。这些机关的领导者，似乎有这样一种观点：搞工程技术的人员，勉强算一个知识分子；搞文、史、哲、政法、经济等社会科学的人员，都不算知识分子。其实，在国家机关中，学有专长的大小知识分子是很不少的。他们中间有许多人，本来是从课堂、研究室里走出来的。如果他们自己“念念不忘旧业”，在搞好岗位工作之外，还愿意兼搞一点“副业”，为什么不可以为他们安排一点工作上和学习上的条件？如果说在学校和研究机关的知识分子，在周总理报告之后，基本上满足了“一间房两本书”的要求，而在国家机关工作的有条件做一些研究工作的知识分子，却远没有达到这个要求。遗忘这一部分知识分子是不对的，他们较专业的研究工作者更多接触实际，如果把他们的力量动员起来，我想，对于克服学术研究工作中的教条主义，不无帮助。
    我在监察部工作。我们部里有不少“小”知识分子，他们响应党的号召，在1956年春，掀起了一个“向科学进军”的热潮。在这个热潮中，也有一点偏向，例如，有的不安心工作了，一心向往“副博士”。但大多数青年知识分子的要求是正当的，他们愿意在搞好工作之外，还把在学校中学习过的东西提高一步，或另搞一门自己喜爱的科学，总之是想搞点“副业”。监察部的党组织，并不认真研究这些情况，对正当的要求给以鼓励和实际的帮助，却来一个笼统的“批评”。很多青年同志反映，听了代表党组织的某领导同志作的大报告之后，感到混身冰凉。这一盆冷水是有效的，事隔一年，在监察部再也听不到青年同志们“向科学进军”的呼声了。
    监察部执行党的知识分子政策，除了干过这么一件事之外，没有干过第二件事情。
    还能够说我们国家机关没有严重的内部问题吗？我认为，一切真诚爱护党的人，在这个时候，要勇于揭发党和党员的缺点，提出善意的批评。我是民主党派的成员，同时也是国家机关的干部，我希望国家机关中民主党派的成员，都要积极帮助党的整风运动！
