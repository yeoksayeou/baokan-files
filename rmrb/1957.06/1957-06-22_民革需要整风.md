The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Needs Rectification
　　He Xiangning
　　Recently, a group of anti-socialist rightists, under the pretext of "blooming and contending" and helping the Communist Party in its rectification campaign, have published absurd remarks against the Communist Party, against socialism, and against the people's democratic dictatorship. Some of their fallacies are completely open, while others are more concealed, but their direction and purpose are consistent: to attempt to undermine the socialist cause, undermine the people's democratic dictatorship, usurp leadership, destroy the unity between the Party and the people, and vainly try to turn back the wheel of history, moving towards the capitalist road.
　　The conspiracy of the rightists has evoked deep memories and great vigilance in me regarding the past. Recalling the revolutionary cause led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which was originally glorious and great, there were still betrayals by rightists such as Chen Jiongming and Lu Rongting. In 1922, they opposed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition and seized leadership, causing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause to be interrupted for a time.
　　The Xinhai Revolution, led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the thousands-year-old feudal autocracy. This great achievement has been recorded in history. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's goal of establishing an independent, free, prosperous, and strong New China was not realized, and the reason was the sabotage by rightists. Rightists colluded with imperialism and obstructed the implementation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policies, causing the revolution to encounter great setbacks. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the rightists became even more blatant in opposing the Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, personally initiated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Some even opposed the Principle of People's Livelihood. The rightists said that communism was not suitable for China's national conditions, that the Communist Party was creating leftists within the Kuomintang, and splitting the Kuomintang. Therefore, they purged the Party and "suppressed the communists," launching a ten-year civil war. As a result, the national economy collapsed, the people lived in misery, and Japanese imperialism was invited in. If it were not for the Communist Party's leadership in the War of Resistance, its insistence on unity, and its insistence on progress, China would probably have perished long ago. How could there be today!
　　What I can never forget is that Liao Zhongkai also sacrificed himself at the hands of the rightists. Zhongkai resolutely implemented Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, which aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the rightists, and they finally assassinated him in Guangzhou.
　　Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future. Today, do we want these painful historical events to be repeated? Can we allow the rightists to attack the Party rampantly and usurp leadership?
　　Today's New China has not only completed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's unfinished business, but has also greatly exceeded his ideals. New China's socialist construction in military affairs, diplomacy, industry, agriculture, culture, and science has made rapid progress, the lives of the broad masses of the people have been greatly improved, the socialist revolution has been basically completed, and it has emerged on the international stage as a major power. The Chinese people are no longer called "sick men of East Asia." It is such a pride to be a citizen of the New China!
　　Who led the people of the whole country to overthrow the three mountains of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism that weighed on the people's heads and established the New China? The Communist Party. Who led the entire Chinese people to basically complete the socialist revolution, laid the socialist economic foundation, and is carrying out large-scale socialist construction at an unprecedented speed? The Communist Party.
　　Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan; without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no birth of New China; without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no socialism. This has been proven by ironclad history. However, a group of rightists are attempting to undermine the leadership of the Party, undermine socialism, and dream of dragging China onto the capitalist road. What does this mean? Could it be that China should return to the suffering old China era? Could it be that the people of the whole country should be placed in a state of slavery again?
　　Taking the socialist road and accepting the leadership of the working-class Communist Party are stipulated in the Constitution. If the democratic parties leave socialism and leave the leadership of the Communist Party, they will only perish, and there will be no "long-term coexistence." But the right-wing careerists attempt to seize leadership and undermine socialism, which is wishful thinking.
　　I ask, besides the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which democratic party, which person, can lead China's socialist revolution and socialist construction? Yuan Shikai, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries all once led China. Some people in the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee also led local governments. What were the results of their leadership? China was in a state of poverty, backwardness, and vulnerability for a long time. For decades, it could only produce tens of thousands of tons of steel each year. What about the New China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao now? It produces four to five million tons of steel each year. The victory of the bourgeois revolution and the socialist revolution, as well as the achievements of socialist construction, have rapidly changed the face of old China. Personally, I am not a poisonous weed, but I am not even as good as a fragrant flower. I think no one in the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee or other democratic parties has the qualifications and ability to be a fragrant flower leading the New China. Can rightists be such fragrant flowers? As early as 1922, the Communist Party led the workers' movement and the peasants' movement. At that time, Liao Zhongkai also led the workers' and peasants' movement in Guangdong. Now it has been more than thirty years, and more than 500 million workers and peasants throughout the country have already turned over. They resolutely support socialism and support the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I ask, which member of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee or other democratic parties is qualified to lead the worker-peasant masses? If right-wing careerists usurp leadership and China embarks on the capitalist road, then China will inevitably regress for decades, and 600 million people will once again fall into the abyss of suffering.
　　Precisely because of this, the working class, peasants, students, and intellectuals throughout the country are rising up in a vigorous political and ideological struggle against the anti-socialist rightists. They demand that the democratic parties draw a clear line between themselves and the anti-socialist rightists and resolutely launch a struggle against the rightists. This demand is in line with the interests of the people of the whole country and also in line with the interests of the democratic parties. Therefore, the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee needs rectification, and the democratic parties also need rectification. I agree with the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee starting rectification. Based on the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" (1. Be conducive to uniting the people of all nationalities throughout the country, rather than dividing the people; 2. Be conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction, rather than unfavorable to socialist transformation and socialist construction; 3. Be conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, rather than undermining or weakening this dictatorship; 4. Be conducive to consolidating democratic centralism, rather than undermining or weakening this system; 5. Be conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, rather than getting rid of or weakening this leadership; 6. Be conducive to socialist international unity and the international unity of peace-loving people around the world, rather than detrimental to these unities.), expose the wrong statements and actions of the rightists. Anything that violates these six political criteria should be rectified. For those who have made mistakes, they should be ordered to confess honestly, conduct in-depth self-criticism, and correct their mistakes with practical actions. I hope that the rightists will not be willing to be rightists forever, recognize the times, rein in at the precipice, turn back to the shore, examine and correct their mistakes, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and work for socialism, for a prosperous and strong New China, and for the happiness of the future generations of 600 million people, thoroughly repenting their past mistakes. This is the only bright road. If they remain obstinate, they will be isolated from the people. I hope that the rightists choose the bright road forward.

　　民革需要整风
　　何香凝
    最近以来，有一批反社会主义的右派分子，借口大鸣大放，帮助共产党整风，发表了反对共产党，反对社会主义，反对人民民主专政的荒谬言论。他们的谬论有的采取完全公开的方式，有的采取比较隐蔽的方式，但是他们的方向和目的确是一致的，那就是企图破坏社会主义事业，破坏人民民主专政，篡夺领导权，破坏党和人民的团结，妄图把历史的车轮往后拉，走向资本主义的道路。
    右派分子的这种阴谋，引起我对过去的深切回忆和极大警惕。回忆孙中山先生领导的革命事业，本来是很光荣伟大的，但还有陈炯明、陆荣廷等右派分子的叛变，他们在民国十一年反对孙中山先生北伐，夺取领导，使孙中山先生领导的革命事业曾经一度中断。
    孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命，推翻了几千年君主专制。这一丰功伟绩，已列入史册。可是孙中山先生追求建立独立自由、繁荣富强的新中国的目的，并没有实现，原因就是有右派分子破坏。右派分子和帝国主义勾结，阻挠孙中山先生的政策的贯彻，使革命遭遇到极大挫折。孙中山先生死后，右派分子更明目张胆，反对孙中山先生手创的联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，甚至有的人连民生主义也反对。右派分子说共产主义不适合中国国情，说共产党在国民党内制造左派，分裂国民党，因此清党“剿共”，发动十年内战，结果，全国经济破产，民不聊生，引来了个日本帝国主义。如果不是共产党领导抗战，坚持团结，坚持进步，恐怕中国早亡国了，那还有今天！
    使我永远不能忘怀的是：廖仲恺也是牺牲于右派分子的手中。仲恺坚决执行孙中山先生的三大政策，引起了右派分子极端不满，终于把他刺死于广州。
    前事不忘后事之师。今天，我们还要这些惨痛的历史事件重演吗？我们能让右派分子猖狂地向党进攻，篡夺领导权吗？
    今日之新中国，不仅完成了孙中山先生的未竟事业，而且大大地超过了他的理想。新中国不仅军事、外交、工农业、文化科学等社会主义建设突飞猛进，广大人民生活有了极大的改善，基本上完成了社会主义革命，而且以大国姿态出现于国际舞台。中国人再也不被称为“东亚病夫”了。作为一个新中国的国民是多么令人自豪啊！
    是谁领导全国人民打倒了帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义三座压在人民头上的大山，建立了新中国？共产党。是谁领导全中国人民基本上完成了社会主义革命，奠定了社会主义经济基础，并以空前的速度进行着大规模的社会主义建设？共产党。
    没有共产党的领导，就没有抗日战争的胜利；没有共产党领导，就没有新中国的诞生；没有共产党的领导，就没有社会主义。这已经为铁的历史所证明了。但是，一批右派分子却企图破坏党的领导，破坏社会主义，梦想把中国拉到资本主义的道路去。这意味着什么？难道让中国再回到苦难的旧中国时代去吗？难道再让全国人民处于奴隶地位吗？
    走社会主义的道路，接受工人阶级共产党的领导，是宪法所规定的，民主党派如果离开了社会主义，离开了共产党的领导，只有灭亡，更谈不到“长期共存”了。但是右派野心家企图夺取领导，破坏社会主义，想入非非。
    试问除了共产党和毛主席，有那个民主党派、有那个人能领导中国的社会主义革命和社会主义的建设？袁世凯、北洋军阀、国民党反动派，都曾领导过中国，民革中也有人曾经领导过地方政府。他们领导的结果怎样？中国长期处在贫困、落后、挨打的地位。几十年中每年只能出几万吨钢，现在共产党毛主席领导的新中国怎样？每年出产四五百万吨钢。资产阶级革命和社会主义革命的胜利，以及社会主义建设的成就，飞速地改变了旧中国的面貌。以我个人来说，我不是毒草，但还赶不上香花。我看民革和其他各民主党派，也没有人有这个资望和能力，作为领导新中国的香花，难道右派分子能做这样的香花吗？远在1922年共产党就领导了工人运动和农民运动，当时廖仲恺在广东也领导过工农运动，现在已经三十多年了，全国五亿多工人农民早已经翻身了，他们坚决拥护社会主义，拥护共产党和毛主席的领导，试问民革和其他民主党派谁有资格领导工农群众？如果让右派野心家篡夺了领导，中国走上资本主义的道路，那么中国必将倒退几十年，六亿人民必将重陷痛苦的深渊。
    正是因为如此，所以，全国工人阶级、农民、学生和知识界正在风起云涌，向反社会主义的右派分子展开了一场激烈的政治思想斗争。他们要求民主党派与反社会主义的右派划清界限，坚决展开反右派分子的斗争。这一要求符合全国人民的利益，也符合各民主党派的利益。为此民革需要整风，各民主党派也需要整风。我赞同民革开始整风。以毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中所提出的六条政治标准（一、有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；二、有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；三、有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；四、有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；五、有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；六、有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。）为根据，揭露右派分子的错误言论和行动。凡违反这六项政治标准的都应整掉。对于犯错误的人，应当责成他们坦白交代，深入检查，以实际行动改正他们的错误。我希望右派分子不要甘心长远做右派，认识时务，悬崖勒马，回头是岸，检查、改正错误，接受共产党的领导，为社会主义，为繁荣富强的新中国，为六亿人民的后代幸福，痛改前非，这是唯一的光明大道，如果仍然执迷不悟，就是自绝于人民，我希望右派分子选择光明大道前进。
