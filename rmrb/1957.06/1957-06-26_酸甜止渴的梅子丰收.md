    Plentiful Harvest of Sweet and Sour Plums Quenches Thirst
    The famous fruit-producing area of ​​East and West Dongting Mountains in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, has another bumper harvest of plums this year. Plums are the earliest fruit to hit the market in Zhenze County. The county has 1,156 mu of plum orchards, with an annual output of 15,000 dan. This year, due to increased fertilizer application and the promotion of technical measures, the output will increase to more than 18,000 dan, an increase of 35% over last year. There are two types of plums here, ripe plums and green plums. Ripe plums can be eaten raw and taste sour and sweet; green plums can be made into dried plums or plum sauce after being processed with salt and sugar, and they taste sweet and sour. They sell well at home and abroad, and are also a necessary thirst quencher for desert travel and long marches. (Sheng Yanru)

    酸甜止渴的梅子丰收
    著名的花果之乡——江苏震泽县东、西洞庭山，今年梅子又告丰收。梅子是震泽县水果中上市最早的一种，全县有梅园一千一百五十六亩，年产量为一万五千担。今年由于增施肥料，推广技术措施，产量将增加到一万八千多担，比去年增产35％。这里的梅子有熟梅和青梅二种，熟梅可生吃，味酸带甜；青梅加盐和糖制作后，可制梅干或梅酱，酸甜可口。畅销于国内外，也是沙漠旅行和长途行军所必须的止渴剂。    （盛燕如）
