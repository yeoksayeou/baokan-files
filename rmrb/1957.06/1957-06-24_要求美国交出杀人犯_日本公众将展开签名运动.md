　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The "Sagamihara Incident Countermeasures Council," composed of local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party and Socialist Party in Gunma Prefecture, as well as other mass organizations, decided on the 21st to launch a petition campaign in ten cities in Gunma Prefecture, demanding that the American murderer Girard be handed over to Japanese courts for trial.

    The council believes that the decision by the U.S. Federal District Court to refuse to hand Girard over to Japanese courts for trial clearly trampled on the decision made by the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on this matter, thereby undermining international credibility. The council decided that in the upcoming petition campaign, it will demand that the United States hand Girard over to Japanese courts for trial and that Japanese judicial authorities make a fair judgment that is not based on political considerations.

　　要求美国交出杀人犯
    日本公众将展开签名运动
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：由群马县日本共产党和社会党的地方组织以及其他群众团体组成的“相马原事件对策协议会”，在21日决定在群马县的十个城市里展开签名运动，要求把美国杀人犯哲腊德交给日本法庭审判。
    协议会认为，美国联邦地方法院关于拒绝把哲腊德交由日本法庭审判的决定显然践踏了日美联合委员会曾经就这件事作出的决定，从而破坏了国际信义。协议会决定在即将展开的签名运动中，要求美国把哲腊德交给日本法庭审讯，并且要求日本司法当局作出公正而不是出于政治考虑的判决。
