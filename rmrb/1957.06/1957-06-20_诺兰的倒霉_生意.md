International Notes

　　Nolan's Unlucky "Business"
　　On June 9th, the American Columbia Broadcasting System broadcast a wonderful program: Nolan talking about disarmament. Nolan announced a "plan" that he had already submitted to the U.S. State Department: demanding that Soviet troops withdraw from Hungary or that "the Russians withdraw from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania," in exchange for "turning Norway into a strictly neutral country." He said this was to "test" the Soviet Union's peace "sincerity."
　　At first glance, one might think that this was a comedian from the broadcasting company making wild remarks to make people laugh. To say nothing else, the one proposing the "plan" is an American, but the "capital" he is offering for negotiation is the national status of another country. However, this is not a joke. The person proposing the plan is Republican Senator Nolan, who is quite well-known in the United States. Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles subsequently confirmed that this was indeed the case and said that he "fully agreed with Senator Nolan's view that every appropriate effort should be made to get Soviet troops to withdraw from Hungary."
　　As everyone knows, Nolan is the head of the so-called "China Lobby." He has always made a career of clamoring for war, being hostile to China, and opposing peace and negotiation. Now, Nolan is actually talking about disarmament and international negotiation, which is like an owl talking about the sun, and can be considered news.
　　Regarding the absurdity of this Nolan plan, Norwegian newspapers have already found a suitable adjective for it: "an astonishingly brazen plan." Therefore, there is no need to say more here. What is worth mentioning is why Nolan thought of proposing such an absurd plan.
　　For several years, Nolan and his gang have been quite rampant in the United States. But recently they have not been so lucky. With the rapid development of the People's Republic of China, their protection of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is eking out a precarious existence in Taiwan, has become a laughing stock all over the world. Recently, large-scale anti-American demonstrations broke out in Taiwan, and Britain unilaterally relaxed its "embargo" against China. These events gave Nolan and his "China Lobby" two loud slaps in the face, causing them to fall silent for a while. Now, Nolan has put forward such a "plan" in an attempt to improve his unlucky situation by finding a sensational topic. He probably thought that his "plan" was absurd anyway, and no one would take it seriously. However, Norway, which is involved, does not want to see such actions by influential figures in American politics that have received the support of the State Department as so simple. As soon as Nolan's remarks were published, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange immediately stated: It seems "very astonishing that Americans are interfering in the foreign policy of other countries in this way."
　　As far as the U.S. ruling group is concerned, it is not a new thing to use other countries for political speculation. But this time, Senator Nolan's "business" seems to be a losing one. The goal of sensationalism can be said to have been achieved, but it has also increased Washington's already stinking reputation. (Ping)

### 诺兰的倒霉“生意”

　　诺兰的倒霉“生意”
    美国哥伦比亚广播公司在6月9日播送了一个精采节目：诺兰谈裁军问题。诺兰宣布了他已经向美国国务院提出的一个“计划”：要求苏联军队撤出匈牙利或者“俄国人退出爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛”，交换条件是“把挪威变成一个严格的中立国家”。他说，这是为了“考验”苏联的和平“诚意”。
    乍一听来，人们会以为这是广播公司的一个滑稽演员在信口开河，引人发笑。别的不说，提“计划”的是美国人，而他拿出的讨价“资本”却是另外一个国家的国家地位。但是，事实上这却并非玩笑。提计划的人是在美国颇有一点名气的共和党参议员诺兰。而且美国国务卿杜勒斯随后证实确有其事，并说他“完全同意诺兰参议员的看法，即，应当尽一切适当的努力，使苏联军队撤出匈牙利。”
    大家都知道，诺兰是所谓“院外援华集团”的头子，他一向是以叫嚣战争、敌视中国、反对和平和协商为职业的。现在，诺兰居然也谈起裁军和国际协商问题来了，猫头鹰谈太阳，倒算得是一条新闻。
    关于这个诺兰计划的荒唐程度，挪威的报纸已经给它找到了一个适当的形容辞：“惊人的厚脸皮计划”。因此这里不必多说了。值得一提的是为什么诺兰想到要提出这样一个荒唐的计划来。
    几年来，诺兰一伙人在美国一直是相当嚣张的。但是近来他们却不大走运。随着中华人民共和国的迅速发展，他们卫护在台湾苟延残喘的蒋介石集团一事，成了全世界的笑柄。最近，台湾发生反美大示威，英国单独放宽对华“禁运”，这些事件又重重地打了诺兰和他的“院外援华集团”两个响亮的耳光，使得他们一时噤不作声。现在，诺兰提出这么一个“计划”，是想找个耸人听闻的话题，以图改善一下自己的倒霉处境。他大概以为，他的“计划”反正很荒唐，没有人会认真计较的。但是，被牵涉在内的挪威却并不想把美国政界有影响的人物这种得到了国务院支持的行动看得那样简单。诺兰的谈话一发表挪威外交大臣兰格立即表示：美国人“这样来干涉其他国家的外交政策似乎是很惊人的”。
    就美国统治集团说来，把其他国家拿来进行政治投机，本不是什么新鲜的事情。但是这一次参议员诺兰作的这笔“生意”，看来是得不偿失的。耸人听闻的目的可以说是达到了，但同时也增加了华盛顿的本已够臭的坏声名。　（平）
