Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese government authorities stated on June 6th that the US decision to appoint a High Commissioner for Okinawa will not affect Japan's demand for the return of Okinawa's administrative power.

According to Kyodo News, sources in Tokyo believe that the US government's announcement on June 5th to establish a High Commissioner on Okinawa Island starting July 1st is a means for the US to consolidate its position in order to continue occupying the island. According to the US decision, after the US Far East Command is dissolved on July 1st, it will transfer all its power to govern Okinawa to the newly appointed High Commissioner.

Kyodo News says that the people of Okinawa have already contacted the representatives of the Ryukyu Legislature who are petitioning in Tokyo, and they will launch a strong opposition movement against the US military authorities' expansion of land requisition, and will not stop until their goal is achieved.

The four representatives of the Ryukyu Legislature who recently arrived in Tokyo went to the Foreign Ministry this afternoon to petition Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, requesting him to negotiate strongly with the US on issues such as the US military's forced requisition of land using lump-sum rental payments during his visit to the United States.

It is said that Nobusuke Kishi has told the representatives that he will fully consider the demands of the Okinawan people and will make it one of the main purposes of his visit to the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch, Tokyo: According to the "Akahata" newspaper, Japanese writer from Okinawa, Keiichiro Ishino, author of the film script "Himeyuri no Tou" (Lily Tower), spoke with great indignation about the incident of American soldiers shooting a farmer in Japan and the Taipei incident: "Such incidents often happen in Okinawa."

Keiichiro Ishino said that, for example, in the autumn of 1955, in Naha City, an American soldier raped and murdered a six-year-old girl, Yumiko, and threw her body into a garbage dump. In the spring of 1956, in Misato Village in central Okinawa, three women went to collect scrap iron in an open space near the US military ammunition depot. One of the women, Etsuko Yona, was shot and killed by a US military guard. Such things are countless. The perpetrator who killed Yumiko was sent back to the United States; the perpetrator who killed Etsuko Yona was also acquitted.

Keiichiro Ishino also said: In Okinawa, many people's land is occupied. Some people raise goats on small pastures to make a living. However, American soldiers often run to the pastures and shoot goats for fun. In their view, this is just a game, but in our view, this is a matter of life and death.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch, Washington: US Federal Judge McGarraghy signed an order on June 6th stipulating that US authorities must temporarily not hand over the American soldier Girard, who killed someone in Japan, to the Japanese authorities for trial.

McGarraghy had received a petition requesting the US court to transfer Girard back to the United States for trial by the US court. McGarraghy rejected this request. However, he decided to hold a hearing on the petition and stipulated that the US authorities must not hand over Girard to Japan before hearing so-called "more arguments."

The petition was filed by two American lawyers preparing to defend Girard—Carroll and Harrington. The petition insisted that Japan had no right to try Girard and that handing Girard over to the Japanese authorities would deprive Girard of his "constitutional rights."

    冲绳人民坚决要求收回行政权
    日本一作家控诉美军在冲绳岛的暴行
    美国司法当局不肯交出杀人犯哲腊德
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本政府当局6月6日表示，美国任命冲绳高级专员的决定，不会影响日本关于收回冲绳行政权的要求。
    据共同社报道，东京有关方面人士认为，美国政府6月5日公布的从7月1日起在冲绳岛设立高级专员的决定，是美国为了继续占领这个岛而采取的巩固它的地位的一种手段。根据美国的决定，远东美军司令部在7月1日撤销以后，将把它对统治冲绳的全部权力移交给新任命的高级专员。
    共同社说，冲绳人民已经同正在东京请愿的琉球立法院的代表们取得联系，他们要对美军当局扩大征用土地的问题展开强有力的反对运动，不达目的，决不休止。
    最近到东京的琉球立法院的四名代表，今天下午已经到外务省向日本首相岸信介请愿，要求他在访问美国的时候，就美军用一次付清租金的办法强迫征用土地等问题进行强有力的交涉。
    据说岸信介已经向代表们表示，他要充分考虑冲绳人民的要求，并且要把它作为访问美国的主要目的之一。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”报道，原籍冲绳的日本文学家、电影剧本“姬百合之塔”的作者石野经一郎在谈到美国兵在日本枪杀农妇的事件和台北事件的时候，十分愤慨地说：“在冲绳经常发生那样的事件”。
    石野经一郎说，例如，1955年秋天，在那霸市，美国兵强奸了一个六岁幼女由美子以后，把她杀害了，还把她的尸体扔到垃圾堆里。1956年春天，在冲绳中部的美里村，有三个妇女到美军弹药库附近的空地上去收集碎铁，其中有一个妇女与那悦子被美军卫兵开枪打死了。这样的事是举不胜举的。杀害由美子的犯人被送回美国了事；打死了与那悦子的犯人也被宣判无罪。
    石野经一郎还说：在冲绳有很多人的土地被霸占。有些人在很小的牧场上养一些山羊来过活。但是，美国兵常常跑到牧场上，以开枪射击山羊取乐。在他们看来，这只是一种游戏，但是在我们看来，这是生死存亡的问题。
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦法官麦克格拉基6月6日签署一项命令，规定美国当局暂时不得把在日本杀人的美国兵哲腊德交给日本当局审讯。
    麦克格拉基曾经收到一个呈文：要求美国法院把哲腊德调回美国，由美国法院审讯。麦克格拉基拒绝了这个要求。但是他决定就这个呈文开庭审理，并且规定在听取所谓“更多的论据”以前，美国当局不得把哲腊德交给日本。
    提出呈文的是准备为哲腊德辩护的两名美国律师——卡罗尔和哈林顿。呈文硬说日本无权审讯哲腊德，把哲腊德交给日本当局是剥夺哲腊德的“宪法权利”。
