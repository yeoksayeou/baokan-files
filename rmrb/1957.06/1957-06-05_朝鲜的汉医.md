Korean Traditional Medicine
By our reporter Wang Yuzhang

Last April, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a decision to develop traditional Korean medicine (Han medicine). In the year since this decision was made, Han medicine, which has a long historical tradition in Korea, has entered a new stage of development.

Korean traditional medicine has a long history. According to records, Chinese medical techniques were introduced to Korea along with cultural exchanges between China and Korea during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. These techniques combined with Korea's original medical practices to become Korea's "Dongui" (Eastern Medicine), also known as "Han medicine" or "Hanbang medicine." Medical books appeared as early as the Silla Dynasty. By the time of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty, Korean Han medicine had developed to a considerably advanced stage. At that time, more than 100 medical books, including the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic and Treatise on Cold Damage, were published. During the Joseon Dynasty, famous doctors such as Heo Jun were organized to compile comprehensive medical books such as the "Dongui Bogam," "Uibang Yuchwi," and "Hyangyak Jipseongbang," huge volumes of comprehensive medical books. Among them, the "Uibang Yuchwi," compiled by Kim Sun-ui and others in 1445, had 226 volumes and 264 books. The "Hyangyak Jipseongbang," compiled by Yu Hyo-tong and others in 1450, discussed 959 disease categories and 931 disease origins, recording 10,700+ prescriptions and 1,470+ acupuncture methods. These books contributed not only to Korea but to the development of Eastern medicine as a whole. Recently, China's People's Medical Publishing House also published the "Dongui Bogam." Historically, Korea has also produced some famous doctors. Emperor Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty twice came to Goryeo to hire Xue Jingcheng, a famous doctor at the time, to treat his illness. In 414 AD during the Silla Dynasty, Kim Bo-jin, a famous Korean doctor, was invited to Japan to treat Emperor Ingyo of Japan. This shows that Korean medical skills were already famous overseas at that time. In modern times, Korea also had famous doctors such as Li Jinghua, whose stories were widely circulated among the people.

Korean traditional medicine suffered a great deal of damage during the Japanese imperialist occupation. At that time, the Japanese forced Korean Han doctors to study Western medicine and prohibited them from treating patients using traditional methods.

According to statistics from the Korean Ministry of Health, there are now about 3,000 full-time and part-time Han doctors in northern Korea. Most people practice medicine and sell herbs at the same time. Han doctors have a high reputation among the people.

Since the Cabinet issued the decision on the development of Han medicine last year, the Han Medicine Guidance Department has been established within the Korean Ministry of Health. Eight major hospitals in Pyongyang have hired famous Han doctors and established Han medicine diagnosis and treatment departments. Central hospitals in each province and hospitals directly under the Ministry of Health will also establish Han medicine diagnosis and treatment departments. In order to study and develop Han medicine academics, the Korean Academy of Sciences has established an Oriental Medicine Research Office, and the three medical universities in Pyongyang, Hamhung, and Chongjin will also establish Han medicine research offices. In the future, Han medicine courses will be added to the medical university curriculum, and Han medicine departments will be established to train successors.

One of the main organizational measures currently being taken in Korea to develop Han medicine is to mobilize Han doctors to organize their own comprehensive clinics. These cooperative clinics, which combine medical treatment and herb sales and are composed of Han doctors scattered throughout the country who pool funds, equipment, and talent with the help of the government, are better equipped, have more concentrated talent, and have a more complete range of medicines, so that they can better serve the residents. At present, 90 such clinics have been organized in northern Korea, with 200 consultation points and 600 staff members. There are twelve such clinics in Pyongyang.

The reporter visited the Han Medicine Treatment Department of Pyongyang City Clinical Hospital and the First Han Medicine Comprehensive Clinic. As soon as you enter the consulting rooms of these two units, you can see the people's trust in Han medicine. Many People's Army officers, government employees, and old ladies in white dresses were waiting for treatment here, crowding the waiting room. Doctors in these units often have to continue seeing patients until the evening after working eight hours because there are so many patients.

The Han Medicine Treatment Department of the Clinical Hospital was established in December last year. The department is headed by 51-year-old Mr. Cui Changzhong, a third-generation family doctor of Han medicine, who has been practicing medicine for 25 years. He is particularly skilled in acupuncture. Not long ago, he cured a worker's leg contusion. Construction worker Li Bingshun fell from a construction frame and contused one of his knees. He had been to several hospitals for many days without being cured and had become a cripple. Mr. Cui Changzhong used needles to release stagnant blood five times and finally completely cured him. Li Bingshun was so happy that he hugged Cui Changzhong and danced. When this treatment department was first established, about 25 patients came to see a doctor every day, but from February to now it has increased to an average of 60 people per day.

The Han Medicine Treatment Department of this hospital closely cooperates with doctors in other departments of the hospital in their work, and they learn from each other. Western medicine doctors often refer patients they believe will be better treated by Han medicine to the Han Medicine Treatment Department, and vice versa. Not long ago, Cui Changzhong cured a six-year-old girl with lower limb paralysis using acupuncture. The Western medicine doctor at this hospital took X-ray photos of the girl's lower limbs before and after recovery for research and study.

The First Han Medicine Comprehensive Clinic in Pyongyang has two doctors, Kim Jeong-ui, 56, and Li Neung-baek, 58, both of whom are self-taught. The medical books they often read include Jingyue Quanshu, Dongui Bogam, etc. In addition, they also subscribe to Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine magazines, Health News, People's Daily, etc. Last summer, the doctors at this clinic also used the Chinese prescription for encephalitis—Angong Niuhuang Wan—in conjunction with the hospital to treat encephalitis, and the results were good. The mortality rate was reduced from 80%-90% to 25%. Thirty to forty patients come to this clinic every day, and each person is charged a consultation fee of 10 North Korean won (equal to the postage for a regular letter). The clinic has an attached pharmacy where they make and sell medicines, which is very convenient for patients to buy medicine after seeing a doctor. These two doctors are good at treating gastrointestinal diseases, tuberculosis, and nervous system diseases. Patients who have been cured and their relatives often bring rice cakes to thank the doctors.

Korea also produces a rich variety of raw medicinal materials, about 300 species. In addition to the internationally renowned Korean ginseng, famous Korean medicinal materials include Angelica sinensis, Poria cocos, Gentiana, Asarum, Rhubarb, and Calculus bovis. At present, Korea exports more than 30 kinds of medicinal materials, and imports more than 90 kinds of medicinal materials such as Magnolia officinalis, Fritillaria cirrhosa, Clove, and Cinnamon bark, mainly from China.

    朝鲜的汉医
    本报记者　王玉章
    去年的4月间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁作出了一项发展汉医的决定，这个决定作出后的一年来，在朝鲜有悠久历史传统的汉医进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    朝鲜的汉医已有长远的历史，据记载，汉武帝时中国的医术就随着中朝两国的文化交流传到了朝鲜，和朝鲜原有的医术结合成为朝鲜的“东医”，或称“汉医”、“汉方医”。在新罗时代就有医书问世。到了李朝世宗年代朝鲜的汉医发展到相当发达的阶段，当时出版了包括黄帝内经、伤寒论等书在内的一百多种医书。李朝时代并组织了许?等一代名医编成了“东医宝鉴”“医方类萃”“乡药集成方”等大部头的综合性的医书，其中1445年金循义等编成的“医方类萃”一书就有二百二十六卷，二百六十四册。1450年俞孝通等编成的“乡药集成方”中论述了九百五十九种病类和九百三十一种病源，记载了一万零七百多个药方和一千四百七十多个针灸法。这些书不仅在朝鲜，对整个东方医学的发展都有贡献，最近中国的人民卫生出版社还出版了“东医宝鉴”一书。朝鲜历史上也出过一些有名的名医，元朝皇帝忽必烈曾二次来高丽聘请当时的名医薛景成去给他治病。新罗时代公元414年，朝鲜的名医金波镇曾受到日本的延请过海去为日本的允恭王治病。这说明那时朝鲜的医术就已名扬海外。到了近代朝鲜也曾有过李景华等名医，他们的故事在民间广泛的流传着。
    朝鲜的汉医在日本帝国主义者占领时期受到了较大的摧残。当时日本人强迫朝鲜的汉医学习西医，禁止汉医用传统的方法看病。
    据朝鲜保健省统计，现在朝鲜北部约有专职的和兼业的汉医三千人。大多数人都是看病兼卖草药。汉医在人民中有很高的威信。
    自从去年内阁下达关于发展汉医的决定后，朝鲜保健省内设立了汉医指导部。平壤市有八个较大的医院聘请了著名的汉医，设立了汉医诊疗科，各道的中央医院和保健省直属的各医院也要设立汉医诊疗科。为了研究发展汉医学术，朝鲜科学院设立了东方医学研究室，平壤、咸兴、清津三个医科大学也要设立汉医学研究室，并准备在医科大学内增加汉医学的课程，将来进一步设立汉医系，以培养后继人材。
    朝鲜目前在发展汉医方面一个主要的组织措施是发动汉医自己组织综合诊疗所，分散在各地的汉医在政府的帮助下自己凑集资金、设备和人材组成的这种合作社式的看病兼卖药的综合诊疗所，设备比较完善，人材比较集中，药物比较全，可以更好的为居民服务。现在朝鲜北部已经组织了九十个这样的诊疗所，拥有二百个诊疗点、六百个工作人员。在平壤市有十二个这样的诊疗所。
    记者访问了平壤市临床医院的汉医治疗科和第一汉医综合诊疗所。一走进这两个单位的诊疗室就可以看到人民对汉医的信任。许多人民军的军官，机关职员，穿白裙子的老太太都在这里候诊，把候诊室挤得满满的。这些单位的医生常常因为病人多不得不在工作了八小时以后继续看病到晚上。
    临床医院的汉医治疗科是去年12月间设立的，主持这个科的是五十一岁的三代祖传汉医崔昌钟老先生，他已行医二十五年。他特别擅长针灸，不久前他治好了一个工人的腿部蹉伤。建筑工人李炳顺从建筑架上失足掉下来，蹉伤了一只膝盖，很多日子来经过了几个医院没有治好，人已经变成了跛子。崔昌钟先生用针给他放了五次瘀血，最后完全治好了，李炳顺欢喜得抱着崔昌钟跳起舞来。这个治疗科初设立时每天约有二十五个病人来看病，从2月份到现在增加到平均每天六十人。
    这个医院的汉医治疗科同院内其他部门的医生在工作中密切地配合，并互相进行学习。西医医生经常把他认为汉医治疗更好的病人介绍到汉医治疗科来，反过来汉医治疗科也这样作。不久前崔昌钟用针灸法治好了一个下肢瘫痪的六岁的女孩，这个医院的西医把女孩的下肢愈前愈后分别摄成X光照片，进行研究学习。
    平壤市第一汉医综合诊疗所有两个医生，五十六岁的金鼎义和五十八岁的李能百都是自己学习成功的。他们常读的医书有景岳全书、东医宝鉴等。另外他们也订阅了中国的中医杂志、健康报、人民日报等。这个诊疗所的医生们去年夏季还曾用中国治脑炎的药方——安宫牛黄散配合医院医治脑炎，结果收到了良好的效果，死亡率由80％—90％降低到25％。这个诊疗所每天有三十到四十个病人来看病，每人收诊费朝币十元（等于一封平信的邮资）。诊疗所内附有药店，自己制药卖药，病人看了病就着买药很方便。这两位医生擅长看肠胃病、肺结核、神经系统病等，经常有治愈了的病人和病人的亲人拿着米糕，来感谢先生。
    朝鲜出产的生药材也很丰富，大约出产三百多种。除了国际闻名的高丽人参以外，朝鲜产的有名的药材还有：当归、茯苓、龙胆、细辛、大黄、牛黄等。现在朝鲜出口的药材有三十多种，另外进口的药材有厚朴、贝母、丁香、桂皮等九十多种。主要是从中国进口。
