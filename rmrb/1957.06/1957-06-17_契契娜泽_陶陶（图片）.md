　　That afternoon, Georgian Honored Artist Chichinadze Tao Tao performed in the classic drama "King Irakli." She played the princess. After she finished her curtain call, I went backstage to paint her portrait. For a full three hours, she maintained the posture and intense expression of the character in the play. She kept asking me, "Is the emotion still sufficient?" "Does it meet your needs?" "You can ask me without reservation." I knew that this touching enthusiasm stemmed from friendship.

    那天下午，格鲁吉亚功勋演员契契娜泽·陶陶演出古典剧“伊良开理王”。她饰演公主。等她谢完幕，我到后台去为她写像。整整三个小时，她始终保持着剧中人物的这个姿势和强烈的表情。她不断地问我：“感情还够吗？”“是否合乎您的需要？”“您可以不客气地要求我”。我知道这种令人感动的热情产生自友谊。
