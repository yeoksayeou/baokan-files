An important event promoting the development of the international situation.

    The recent conversation of Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with American television and radio reporters has attracted the attention of all peace-loving people. This conversation touched upon the fundamental issues in the current international situation, namely the issue of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems, as well as the urgent need to resolve the issues of disarmament, cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and the establishment of normal relations between countries in order to achieve peaceful coexistence. Comrade Khrushchev affirmed the necessity of peaceful coexistence and put forward positive opinions on solving the current pressing problems. At a time when the international situation is tending towards relaxation due to the efforts of the people of all countries, Comrade Khrushchev's conversation is a major event promoting the development of the situation.

    Comrade Khrushchev's remarks on disarmament are obviously the most noteworthy. At the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, the Soviet Union has already put forward proposals for seeking limited agreements, and is now waiting for the United States to state its position. In his published remarks, Comrade Khrushchev reiterated that even if a comprehensive agreement cannot be reached on disarmament, the Soviet Union is very willing to work with Western countries to move from solving small problems to solving big problems. This attitude of the Soviet Union deprives Western countries that are trying to continue to use delaying tactics on the disarmament issue of any excuse, thereby making it possible to break the long-standing deadlock on the disarmament issue. This is of great positive significance for promoting the disarmament negotiations being held in London.

    In his conversation, Comrade Khrushchev also advocated the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the withdrawal of American, British, French, and Soviet troops from European countries. These are extremely important and exciting issues at the moment. Because nuclear weapons testing poses a threat to all mankind, and safeguarding peace and security in Europe is a key issue in safeguarding world peace. Comrade Khrushchev's proposition represents not only the will of the Soviet people but also the will of the peace-loving people of Europe and the world. The U.S. State Department hastily stated that Khrushchev's proposal for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to withdraw troops from Europe was "unacceptable," indicating its fear that Khrushchev's proposal would receive a huge response in Europe.

    Comrade Khrushchev also spoke about the establishment of normal relations between countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. He proposed the abolition of trade restrictions and the extensive exchange of delegations of various kinds and professions. Comrade Khrushchev's proposals are also in line with the wishes of the people of all countries who hope to expand economic and cultural contacts and enhance mutual understanding. It is the United States that has erected an "iron curtain" between countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, to block mutual contact and understanding between the people of all countries, especially the people of the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, as Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, as long as the United States is willing to eliminate the "iron curtain" it has erected, then mutual understanding between countries will deepen, and world peace will be better guaranteed.

    Comrade Khrushchev's conversation was welcomed by the American people. This proves that the American people want peace and a relaxation of the international situation. The U.S. State Department, however, showed a completely opposite attitude, making many reservations and objections to the positive suggestions made by Comrade Khrushchev. From the fundamentally different attitudes taken by the U.S. government and the Soviet leaders, people can clearly see that the Soviet Union is a staunch defender of world peace, and it is actively working to promote the relaxation of the international situation and the improvement of relations between countries, while the United States is an obstacle to world peace, and it is deliberately trying to obstruct the relaxation of the situation and the improvement of relations between countries.

    However, many recent events show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to obstruct the development of the international situation. Comrade Khrushchev's conversation clearly pointed out the path to easing the international situation at the present stage. As long as we firmly move forward along these paths, the people of all countries will be able to stop the war schemes of the United States and pave the way for achieving lasting world peace.

    推动国际局势发展的重要事件
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志最近对美国电视广播记者发表的谈话，引起了一切爱好和平的人民的重视。这个谈话涉及到了当前国际局势中的根本性的问题，即不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处、和平竞赛的问题，以及为实现和平共处而迫切需要解决的裁军问题、停止核武器试验问题、建立各国之间的正常关系的问题。赫鲁晓夫同志肯定了和平共处的必要性，并且在解决当前迫切的问题上提出了积极的意见。正当国际局势由于各国人民的努力而在趋向和缓的时候，赫鲁晓夫同志的这次谈话，是推动局势发展的一个重大事件。
    赫鲁晓夫同志关于裁军问题的谈话，显然是最受人注意的部分。在联合国裁军小组委员会上，苏联已经提出了谋求有限度协议的建议，现在就等着美国表明态度了。赫鲁晓夫同志在发表的谈话中再次表示，即使在裁军问题上不能达成全面协议，苏联也非常愿意同西方国家从解决小问题开始走向解决大问题。苏联的这种态度，就使得企图继续在裁军问题上行使拖延战术的西方国家失去了任何借口，从而使裁军问题有了打开长期僵局的可能。这对促进在伦敦举行的裁军谈判，有着重大的积极的意义。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在谈话中还主张停止核武器试验，和从欧洲国家撤出美国、英国、法国和苏联军队的问题。这些都是当前极为重要的激动人心的问题。因为核武器的试验对全体人类形成了威胁，而保障欧洲的和平与安全，是保障世界和平的关键性的问题。赫鲁晓夫同志的主张，不仅代表着苏联人民的意愿，也代表着欧洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民的意愿。美国国务院赶紧表示赫鲁晓夫关于美、苏双方从欧洲撤军的建议是“不能接受的”，说明它害怕赫鲁晓夫的建议在欧洲将得到巨大的响应。
    赫鲁晓夫同志还谈到了各国之间、首先是美苏之间建立正常关系的问题。他提出了取消贸易限制、广泛交换各种性质和专业代表团的建议。赫鲁晓夫同志的这些建议，同样是符合于希望扩大经济和文化方面的接触、增进相互了解的各国人民的愿望的。现在，正是美国在各国之间、首先是在美国和苏联之间挂起了“铁幕”，以阻隔各国、首先是美苏两国人民之间的互相接触和了解。因此，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所指出的，只要美国肯消除它所树立起来的“铁幕”，那末，各国之间的谅解就会加深，而世界和平也就有了更好的保障。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的谈话，受到了美国人民的欢迎。这证明美国人民是要和平、要国际局势的缓和的。而美国国务院却表现了完全相反的态度，对赫鲁晓夫同志提出的积极建议作了许多保留和反对。人们从美国政府同苏联领导人所采取的这种根本不同的态度可以清楚地看出：苏联是世界和平的坚决的捍卫者，它积极为促进国际局势的缓和与改善各国的关系而努力，而美国却是世界和平的障碍物，它处心积虑地要阻挠局势的缓和与各国关系的改善。
    但是，最近发生的许多事件说明，美国要阻挠国际局势的发展，是越来越困难了。赫鲁晓夫同志的谈话，明确地指出了现阶段和缓国际局势的途径。只要循着这些途径坚定地前进，各国人民就能制止美国的战争阴谋，为取得世界的持久和平开辟道路。
