To the Editor:

    After reading Yang Yuqing's speech published on the second page of your newspaper on June 5th, I have the following comments: The rectification movement starts from the desire for unity and, through criticism, achieves a higher stage of unity, not to put certain comrades to death. I find it hard to believe that Yang Yuqing's speech expresses a well-intentioned opinion in this spirit. He said, "These people should step down; it is not enough to appease the people's anger if they do not step down," and "The editor-in-chief of the People's Daily must step down because the People's Daily has been singing praises for years." Obviously, he considers himself a representative of the people and voices grievances. But how many people can his "people" actually include? I think it can only be a very small number of people. If one considers his own or a few people's indignation as "the people's anger," then that is not being realistic.

    Has the People's Daily been singing praises for years? No. In recent years, the People's Daily has indeed publicized the revolutionary victories achieved by our country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, publicized the happy future of socialist society, publicized the great achievements, enthusiasm, and confidence of our people in building socialism, publicized the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in our country, and reflected our people's love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. To call these the singing of praises of the old society is to distort the facts and slander the people.

    I also disagree with the statement that "true men of letters are anti-status quo, and good articles have been anti-status quo since ancient times." It is true that in a society ruled by the exploiting class, "true men of letters" are anti-"status quo" because their articles, to a greater or lesser extent, represent the demands and aspirations of the people, which is why they earn the title of "true men of letters." In a society where the working class holds power, "men of letters," in addition to opposing the toxins left over from the old society, mainly reflect and publicize new things. Otherwise, they are not "men of letters" of the people. However, according to Yang Yuqing's statement, "men of letters" must rise up to oppose all phenomena in our society, including the building of socialism and the people's democratic dictatorship, which our people will absolutely not allow to be "opposed."

### 杨玉清所指的“民”究竟能包括多少人？

    杨玉清所指的“民”究竟能包括多少人？编辑同志：
    看了你报6月5日第二版登的杨玉清的发言，有下面一点意见：整风运动是从团结愿望出发，经过批评达到更高阶段的团结，而不是为了将某些同志整死。我认为杨玉清的发言就很难使人相信他是本着这样的精神提出善意的意见的。他说：“这些人应该下台，不下台不足以平民愤”，“人民日报总编辑非下台不可，因为人民日报几年来都在歌功颂德”。显然，他是以人民的代表自居而发出不平的呼声的。但他所指的“民”究竟能包括多少人呢？我想只能是极少数的人，如果把自己或少数人的气愤就算作是“民愤”那就不是实事求是的了。
    人民日报是否几年来都在歌功颂德呢？不是的。几年来人民日报的确宣传了我国在中国共产党领导下所取得的革命胜利，宣传社会主义社会幸福的前途，宣传我国人民建设社会主义的伟大成就、热情和信心，宣传我国各族人民的团结和合作，以及反映我国人民对共产党和毛主席的热爱，如果把这些说成旧社会的歌功颂德，这就是歪曲事实和对人民的污蔑。
    我也不同意“真正的文人是反现状的，从古以来好文章都是反现状的”说法。诚然，在剥削阶级占统治的社会里，“真正的文人”是反“现状”的，因为他们的文章或多或少代表了人民的要求和愿望，所以才博得“真正的文人”的称号。在工人阶级掌握政权的社会里，“文人”除了反对旧社会遗留下的遗毒外，更主要的是对新事物加以反映和宣传，否则他们就不是人民的“文人”。但是，按照杨玉清的说法，“文人”必须起来反对我们社会上的一切现象，包括建设社会主义和人民民主专政在内，然而这是我国人民所绝对不允许“反”的。
