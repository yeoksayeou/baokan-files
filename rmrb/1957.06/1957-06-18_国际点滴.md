    American Ten-Year-Old Child Commits Armed Assault
    A ten-year-old child plunged a village in Pennsylvania into a state of terror on the evening of the 16th. The child, wielding two automatic revolvers, shot at anyone he encountered in the village, forcing the entire village to close their doors and remain indoors, afraid to show their faces.
    This situation continued for two hours, and the police were unable to do anything about the child. In the end, he was captured after falling into a pit.
