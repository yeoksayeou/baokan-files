Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th. Shen Lintai, the township head of Futu Township in Guantao County, Shandong Province, and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, had seven members of his family of nine brutally murdered by counter-revolutionaries on the night of June 1st. The counter-revolutionary murderers, except for one who resisted arrest and was killed on the spot, have all been arrested and brought to justice.

On the night of June 1st, the main culprits Shen Mengchun, Shen Jichun, and the accomplice Wang Peiqi, carrying two rifles, one pistol, and a butcher knife, set out from Jianzhong Village and sneaked into Shenjie Village. They first hid in the home of Shen Jichun (only a wall away from the home of township head Shen Lintai). When township head Shen Lintai returned from a meeting of the production team late at night, these criminals climbed over the wall. Wang Peiqi stood guard outside the door with a gun. Shen Mengchun broke open the door with a knife and rushed in, first stabbing township head Shen Lintai. At the same time, Shen Jichun opened fire and killed Shen's wife. Shen Jilong, Shen Lintai's eldest son, woke up upon hearing the sound and rushed towards Shen Jichun, engaging in a struggle. At this moment, Shen Lintai, enduring the pain, seized the butcher knife from Shen Mengchun's hand. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Shen Jichun abandoned his gun and fled. Shen Lintai and his son chased to the gate, picked up the gun discarded by Shen Jichun, and discovered that there were no bullets in the gun. Shen Lintai, unable to hold on due to excessive bleeding, signaled Shen Jilong to escape. Shen Jilong climbed over the wall and ran out to call for help. At this time, the criminals re-entered the house and killed Shen Lintai, Shen Lintai's old mother, and four children. Only a four-month-old infant was spared, being covered by his mother's body. After committing the crime, these counter-revolutionaries, fearing the arrival of the militia to pursue them, fled in panic, firing their guns. Left at the scene were a cotton robe (used to wrap the gun), two towels, a tea mug (containing paste, intending to post reactionary "notices"), a butcher knife, seventeen rifle and pistol bullets, two pistol magazines, and three reactionary notices that had not been posted.

After the incident, personnel from the Guantao County Public Security Bureau rushed to the scene that night. Responsible persons from the special district and provincial departments, along with public security cadres, also arrived successively the next day. In addition to offering condolences and resettlement to the families of the deceased and burying the dead, the public security personnel, based on clues provided by the local masses, conducted investigations for several days and solved the case within seventy-two hours. The main culprit Shen Mengchun was shot dead on the spot for resisting arrest with a gun, while the main culprits Shen Jichun, Shen Jilan, and the accomplice Wang Peiqi were all captured. Murder weapons, bullets, blood-stained clothing, and drafts of reactionary notices were seized on the spot as evidence.

The counter-revolutionary murderers Shen Mengchun, Shen Jichun, and the murdered township head Shen Lintai were all from Shenjie Village, Futu Township, Guantao County. The criminal Shen Mengchun had served as a platoon leader in the puppet army during the enemy-puppet period. In 1945, he killed Wang Fenghua, a land reform activist in Zhaogongzhai Village, Third District, Guantao County. In the same year, when our army liberated Linqing, Shen Mengchun fled home with two rifles and one pistol, plotting a restoration. In 1947, due to the report of Wang Fenghua's family, he fled to the northeast and hid in a vegetable farm in the suburbs of Fushun City, working as a vegetable worker. However, with a guilty conscience, he always suspected that township head Shen Lintai knew his background and planned to kill him to silence him. His younger brother, Shen Jichun, had also served as a platoon leader in the puppet army. He was idle and did not like to work. Township head Shen Lintai had repeatedly criticized and educated him to promote diligent production, but he not only did not repent but instead harbored resentment and plotted revenge. The female criminal Shen Jilan is the sister of Shen Mengchun and Shen Jichun. In 1944, she reported to the puppet army that Shen Lintai and Yu Chun (from Shenjie Village) had hidden Eighth Route Army guns in their homes, causing great harm to the Shen and Yu families. After Shen Mengchun sneaked back to Shandong from the northeast in April of this year, Shen Jilan dug a hole in her home to hide him. Before the murder, Shen Jilan colluded with Shen Mengchun and others and instructed her son Wang Peiqi to participate in the murder. According to confessions, in addition to plotting to kill Shen Lintai's entire family, they also attempted to kill Yu Chun, the head of the agricultural cooperative and a Communist Party member, Shen Linfu, the production brigade leader, and the family of Wang Fenghua, who was killed by Shen Mengchun in 1945. To silence them, the criminals also planned to kill two old ladies who knew that Shen Mengchun had hidden guns. Then, they planned to unite local counter-revolutionaries to continue carrying out counter-revolutionary activities.

Currently, the preliminary hearing of this counter-revolutionary murder case has concluded, and the procuratorial organs are filing a public prosecution with the people's court. (Attached pictures)

　　谁说没有反革命分子了！
　　馆陶县一乡长全家被杀害七口
　　全案破获，杀人犯一人被击毙其余全落网
    新华社济南24日电　山东省馆陶县浮渡乡乡长、中共党员申林台全家九口，在6月1日深夜惨遭反革命分子杀害七口。反革命凶手，除一名拒捕当场毙命外，其余都已逮捕归案。
    6月1日晚，主犯申孟春、申继春和从犯王培起等三人带着步枪二枝、手枪一枝和屠刀一把从尖冢村出发，窜入申街村，先潜伏在申犯继春家中（同乡长申林台家只有一墙之隔），等到深夜，乡长申林台从生产队开会归来，这些凶犯即越墙而入，由王培起持枪在门外望风。申犯孟春用刀把门劈开闯入，首先将乡长申林台刺伤，申犯继春同时开枪把申妻打死，申林台的大儿申继龙闻声惊起，奔向申犯继春，展开搏斗。这时，申林台忍痛夺下申犯孟春手中的屠刀，申犯继春见势不利就弃枪逃走，申林台父子二人追至大门，捡起申犯继春丢下的枪枝，发觉枪内没有子弹，申林台因流血过多，不能支持，向申继龙示意脱逃，申继龙即越墙向外奔跑呼救。这时，凶犯重新闯入室内杀死申林台和申林台的老母以及四个小孩，仅出世四月的婴儿在其母尸体掩盖下幸免于难。这批反革命分子行凶之后，惧怕民兵前来追捕，即仓惶鸣枪奔逃。现场遗留棉袍一件（包枪用），毛巾二条，茶缸一个（内盛浆糊，企图张贴反动“布告”），屠刀一把，步枪及手枪子弹十七粒，手枪梭子二个，以及未及张贴的反动布告三张。
    这一案发生后，馆陶县公安局人员当晚赶到现场，专区、省有关部门负责人连同公安干部也在次日先后到达，除对死者家属进行慰问、安置并掩埋死者外，公安人员根据当地群众提供的线索，连日侦察，在七十二小时内即行破案。除主犯申孟春持枪在地洞内顽抗当场毙命外，主犯申继春、申继兰，从犯王培起等全部落网。当场搜获杀人凶器，子弹、血衣以及反动布告底稿等罪证。
    反革命杀人凶犯申孟春、申继春和被害乡长申林台都是馆陶县浮渡乡申街村人。凶犯申孟春在敌伪时期当过伪军班长。1945年，曾杀死馆陶县三区赵宫寨村土改积极分子王凤华。同年，我军解放临清时，申孟春曾携带步枪两枝、手枪一枝潜逃回家，阴谋复辟。1947年，因王凤华的家属告发，逃往东北，隐藏在抚顺市郊区的一个农场内当蔬菜工人；但他做贼心虚，一直怀疑乡长申林台知道他的底细，准备杀人灭口。其弟申犯继春，也做过伪军班长，平日游手好闲不爱劳动，乡长申林台曾多次对其进行批评教育促其勤劳生产，但他不但不思悔改，反而怀恨在心，思图报复。女犯申继兰是申孟春、申继春的姊姊，1944年她曾向伪军报告申林台、于春（申街村人）家中藏有八路军的枪枝，使申、于两家受害不浅。今年4月申孟春从东北潜回山东后，申继兰在家中挖了一个地洞把他隐藏起来，在这次凶杀案发生前，申继兰又和申孟春等合谋，并嘱她的儿子王培起参加这一凶杀案。据供，他们除阴谋杀害申林台全家外，还企图杀害农业社社长、共产党员于春，生产大队长申林福，以及在1945年被申犯孟春杀害的王凤华的家属。为了灭口，凶犯们还准备杀死知道申犯孟春隐藏枪枝的二个老太太。然后准备纠合当地反革命分子继续进行反革命活动。
    目前，这一反革命杀人案件预审已经结束，检察机关正在向人民法院提起公诉。（附图片）
