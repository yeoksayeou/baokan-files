　　Bright Light Shines on the Grassland
    Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Industry Flourish in Minority Areas of Gansu

    According to Xinhua News Agency, since the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy in Gansu Province's minority areas in 1954, various construction undertakings have greatly developed.

    The total population of ethnic autonomous regions in Gansu Province is more than two million. In these autonomous regions, agriculture has completed socialist transformation. More than two thousand ethnic cooperatives and ethnic joint cooperatives have been established successively, and most of them are running very well, with over 80% of the cooperatives increasing production. Among them, over 95% of the cooperatives in the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture have increased production. In the past, many fertile fields in the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture were submerged by lake water, forming the so-called "Seventy-Two Connected Lakes" disaster. Before and after cooperation, Hui and Han farmers vigorously built drainage projects and improved irrigation methods, turning hundreds of thousands of acres of lakes and alkaline滩 into fertile fields. The yield per unit area of the original cultivated land has also doubled compared with the early days of liberation. In the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, which is mainly mountainous, Hui and Han farmers have changed their past habits of extensive planting and low yields, and the yield per unit area has also increased by 80%.

    Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in southern Gansu, and the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, Sunan Yugu Autonomous County, and Aksai Kazak Autonomous County in the Qilian Mountains of western Gansu, are all pastoral areas. Due to the correct implementation of policies for developing animal husbandry, animal husbandry production has developed rapidly. Last year was the year with the most livestock propagation in pastoral areas, with an increase of more than 260,000 head of livestock in five purely pastoral counties. In the early days of liberation, Sunan Yugu Autonomous County had only more than 70,000 head of livestock, but now it has developed to more than 300,000 head, with an average of more than 70 head of livestock per person. These pastoral areas are now piloting pastoral production cooperatives.

    The capitals of all autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties in the province are showing a thriving scene. Hezuo, the newly emerging city on the grassland of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, has established hydroelectric power stations, and bright light has begun to shine on the grassland. A mechanized dairy processing plant is also installing machinery and is about to start production. Flour, oil extraction, and power industries have also appeared in other autonomous prefectures. Many new schools, hospitals, and cinemas have also been established in the cities, rural areas, or pastoral areas of the autonomous prefectures. In Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, three middle schools and one normal school were built last year alone, and a Hui girls' middle school is currently being built. In pastoral areas, due to the continuous treatment by ethnic medical teams, venereal diseases that used to harm herders have been greatly reduced. Whether in pastoral or agricultural areas, all counties now have access to automobiles.

　　草原上大放光明
    甘肃少数民族地区农、牧、工业欣欣向荣
    据新华社讯　甘肃省少数民族地区从1954年推行民族区域自治以来，各项建设事业有很大的发展。
    甘肃全省民族自治区域的人口共有二百多万人。在这些自治区里，农业都已完成了社会主义改造，先后建立了两千多个民族社和民族联合社，大多办得很好，80％以上的社增加了生产。其中固原回族自治州增产社达95％以上。吴忠回族自治州过去许多良田被湖水淹没，形成所谓的“七十二连湖”灾害。合作化前后，回汉族农民大力兴修排水工程，改进灌溉方法，使几十万亩湖泊和碱滩变成良田，原有的耕地单位面积产量也比解放初期增加了一倍。以山区为主的临夏回族自治州，回汉族农民改变过去广种薄收的习惯，单位面积产量也提高80％。
    在甘肃南部的甘南藏族自治州和西部祁连山内的天祝藏族、肃北蒙古族、肃南裕固族、阿克塞哈萨克族自治县，都是畜牧业地区，由于正确推行了发展畜牧业的政策，畜牧业生产都发展很快。去年是牧区牲畜增殖最多的一年，有五个纯牧区县增加了二十六万多头牲畜。肃南裕固族自治县解放初期只有牲畜七万多头，现在已经发展到三十多万头，平均每人有牲畜七十头以上。这些牧区现在正在试办牧业生产合作社。
    全省各自治州和自治县的首府，都呈现着一片欣欣向荣的景象。甘南藏族自治州草原上新兴的城市合作，已经建立起水电站，草原上开始大放光明；一座机械化的乳品加工厂也正在安装机器，即将开工生产。其他几个自治州也都出现了面粉、榨油、电力等工业。各自治州的城市、农村或牧区，还建立了不少新的学校、医院和电影院，吴忠回族自治州去年一年就建成了三所中学和一所师范学校，现在还正在建立一所回族女子中学。在牧区由于民族医疗队的连年治疗，过去危害牧民的性病已大大减少。不论牧区或农业区，现在都已达到县县通汽车。
