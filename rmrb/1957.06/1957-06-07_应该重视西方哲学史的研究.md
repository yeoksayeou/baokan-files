Recently, the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office of Peking University, the Philosophy Institute of the Academy of Sciences, and the Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University convened a national "Chinese Philosophy History Work Conference" to promote future research work on the history of Chinese philosophy. This type of conference is of positive significance for the future development of Chinese philosophy.

Don't Emphasize "China" and Neglect "Foreign"

On the one hand, we are very pleased with the future prosperity of research on Chinese philosophy history. On the other hand, looking back at the current research conditions on Western philosophy history, we can't help but feel "inferior." Some people may say: our "sense of inferiority" is completely unnecessary because Chinese philosophy is one of our country's valuable cultural heritages, and we should of course pay special attention to it. As for Western philosophy issues, there are international friends and philosophers researching them, and we only need to import the results of their research.

This view on the research of Chinese philosophy history and Western philosophy history has in fact dominated the thinking of some comrades who lead this work. For example, in the twelve-year long-term plan for philosophy, Western philosophy history is not only not one of the key research areas in the future, but it is also attached to Eastern philosophy history. It is already ill-considered not to regard Western philosophy history as a key research area under the current conditions, and it is even more puzzling to place it under Eastern philosophy history. Another example is that since the establishment of the Philosophy Institute of the Academy of Sciences, it has established a "Philosophy History Group," but in the first two years, its research work was completely unrelated to Western philosophy and only focused on issues of Chinese philosophy as the sole object. Bourgeois philosophy historians often use Western philosophy history to represent world philosophy history, but now we use Chinese philosophy history (although with different motives) to represent world philosophy history.

The Chinese people should value our philosophical and cultural heritage and should regard it as the main object of research, which is completely correct. However, we do not need to neglect the research work on Western philosophy history and ignore the positive role of this science in philosophical research. We must not forget that the current and future research on Chinese philosophy is also very different from the past "closed-door" "sorting out of national heritage." Marxist philosophical thought has become the highest guiding principle in its research. Therefore, from this point of view alone, we should also attach importance to the research of Western philosophy history. Because Marxist philosophy is a revolutionary development in the history of Western philosophy, it has inextricable links with the historical process of materialism's struggle against idealism. Ignoring Western philosophy history will prevent a deep understanding of Marxism, and thus bring losses to the research work of Chinese philosophy.

Those comrades may say that we do not ignore the scientific significance of Western philosophy history, but only believe that the knowledge and theories in this area can be accepted from the research results of international friends and philosophers (such as progressive philosophers in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, as well as in capitalist countries). This view is very naive, or rather, somewhat unprofessional. Because the issues researched by those international friends and philosophers carry their different particularities, so their research results may not be able to meet our actual needs. If these research results are accepted without discrimination, it will not have a positive effect on the improvement of Western philosophy history in terms of cognition and theory.

From the current teaching conditions of philosophy history, what we urgently need to improve through research in terms of cognition and theory is, first, French materialism philosophy, which used to be a cold area in philosophy history; second, Kant and Hegel's philosophy, which is directly related to the development of Marxist dialectics; and third, British empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries, which is closely related to modern bourgeois philosophy. The philosophy of Plato and Aristotle should also occupy an appropriate position in the research of philosophy history. Of course, it is also necessary to study positivism, which began with Comte and became popular through Mach and Avenarius, as well as various major schools of modern bourgeois philosophy, such as pragmatism, logical positivism, phenomenology, and existentialism, as some schools of modern philosophy history.

We do not underestimate the research achievements of international friends and philosophers in the history of philosophy. On the contrary, we cherish their research achievements very much. The development of our future research work in this area needs to pay close attention to their research work and needs their strong help in our research. However, we believe that it is impractical to not want to conduct such important research work independently and to completely lean on others. We believe that only on the basis of independent research can we correctly accept other people's research results and improve the theoretical level and research style in this area. We cannot regard ideological theory as a machine that can be simply imported from abroad; even for a machine, if it does not have the corresponding actual conditions, it cannot be started even if it is transported to China.

Western philosophy history is a science, and as a science, it is essentially the same as other historical sciences. From the perspective of us who are engaged in philosophical work—not limited to those engaged in philosophical work—if we do not treat this science with a correct attitude, it will bring many losses to our philosophical learning and scientific research.

The Importance of Studying the History of Western Philosophy

First, it must be pointed out that if we do not pay attention to the research of Western philosophy, we will not be able to improve the level of learning dialectical materialism (I think that combining the history of Western philosophy and the history of natural science to learn dialectical materialism is the best learning method). In the past or now, some teachers who taught dialectical materialism have ignored this point, so they can only give dogmatic explanations of the basic principles of dialectical materialism, and the students can only accept these basic principles listlessly word by word and sentence by sentence. However, if we explain the basic principles and actual content of its worldview from the historical development process of materialism, and explain how materialists use dialectics as an ideological weapon to wage irreconcilable struggles with idealism, then we can not only avoid the learning situation pointed out above, but also enrich the content of teaching and show the original vivid spirit of dialectical materialism.

It is said that the recently drafted dialectical materialism learning plan of Moscow University is: the first year is to study the history of philosophy, and the second year is to start learning dialectical materialism. I personally believe that this facility has its theoretical and practical reasons and is very wise. In our universities, if actual conditions permit, we may wish to try this method.

Second, it must be pointed out that Western philosophy history has been gradually taught from a Marxist point of view in comprehensive universities for five years. The rapid and smooth progress of this new type of Western philosophy history teaching work cannot be attributed to learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in this area. However, the actual situation of our philosophy is different from that of the Soviet Union, so we cannot dogmatically copy the existing conclusions of the Soviet Union on some issues of philosophy history. We must make their due conclusions through scientific research based on specific circumstances with a realistic spirit.

What we currently feel most thorny about philosophy history issues is the "evaluation" of some great idealist philosophers. We believe that it is incorrect to think that there is nothing to "evaluate" besides criticizing their idealist views on Socrates and Plato; but how can we make a correct "evaluation" of them? We believe that to completely deny Berkeley and Hume as subjective idealists or agnostics ignores the positive significance of Berkeley's theory of vision and Hume's theory of natural religion; but how can we affirm this aspect of them without reducing their hostility to the materialist worldview? We believe that it seems necessary to consider the view that only affirms this aspect of some philosophers with materialist or dialectical factors, such as Kant and Hegel, while completely denying other aspects of their ideological system; but how can we achieve a scientific "evaluation" of them: on the one hand, maintaining the integrity of their ideological system, and at the same time implementing the materialist viewpoint and method?

Also, we always think that the metaphysical way of thinking is "unscientific"; but before the formation of Marxist philosophy, whether in science or philosophy, whether materialists or idealists, the method basically applied to deal with problems of nature and society was this method, is all of this "unscientific"? Such a question, as well as those questions raised above, cannot be simply affirmed or denied. We must do some practical research work on these issues before we can have a say.

Thirdly, the Party and the government have long called on us to strive to catch up with the international academic level within twelve years. In terms of the international academic level, from the philosophical point of view, it means that the questions we raise in this area and the results of our research can be measured by international general academic standards in terms of weight. But I dare to say boldly that judging from the quality of the books or papers published in these years, the distance between our philosophical level and the international level is still very far; our philosophical level has not yet completely broken away from the dogmatic explanation of whether matter is primary or spirit is primary, and is still circling in the speculative confusion of whether Lao Tzu is a materialist or an idealist. If we want to catch up with the international level in philosophy within twelve years, we still need us who are engaged in philosophical work to work hard.

Also, although we often talk about the international level in philosophy, we really don't know much about the actual situation of the current international philosophical circle. For example, do we understand the evolution process of some bourgeois philosophical schools currently popular in capitalist countries, such as logical positivism, phenomenology, existentialism, or neo-Thomism, in the past ten years? I also dare to say boldly that there are not many people who know the truth about this. But the international academic level is not talked about behind closed doors; we must pay attention to the international academic market at any time, and then we can seize the problem and catch up. Therefore, I think that not only should we study the Western European classical philosophy before the formation of Marxist philosophy, but we should not simply reject some major schools of modern bourgeois philosophy as "something utterly corrupt and reactionary in the age of imperialism" from the field of research; we still seem to need to do some research and criticism on them.

The above three points can explain the importance of studying the history of Western philosophy. As for the role of science in the field of human knowledge, which studies the objective law of the development of philosophical thought, it is not necessary to talk about it. Although the research on the history of Western philosophy is of such importance, the current research conditions of this science are extremely bad. First, there is nothing left in this area in old China. There are not many works with academic value in this area, and there are very few translations of Western classical philosophical works into Chinese, and some of these translations are of poor quality. In the past few years after liberation, although the Party and the government have tried to change this situation, the progress has been relatively slow due to objective conditions. Second, before liberation, there were very few comrades who studied Western philosophy and the history of Western philosophy. Some of these comrades changed careers because they could not find suitable work in this area due to the rampant sectarianism in the universities of old China. After liberation, some comrades either felt the burden of their old philosophical baggage and engaged in language teaching work, or because of the difficulty of job transfers; although they had the heart to "return to the team," they had no strength to "return to the team," and could only sigh.

However, what threatens the research on the history of Western philosophy the most is the serious lack of books, periodicals, and other reference materials. We have not seen newly published books and journals from capitalist countries for almost seven years. In the past year, taking the Western Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office of Peking University as an example, although we have subscribed to several journals on philosophy, we have not bought a single Western reference book that we tried to buy and urgently needed. We clearly know from the newly published book catalogs that the complete works of Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and Hegel have been published in new editions one after another, but we can only rely on the old editions from 30 years ago, and sometimes even these old editions are not easy to get. Now the general situation of researching Western philosophy issues is that there are no books to read, no books to refer to, and the teachers and students are the same. Under these circumstances, we have felt thorny to meet the needs of teaching Western philosophy history, and it is simply impossible to do more in-depth scientific research in this area.

Four Specific Suggestions

The science of Western philosophy history is already facing a crisis. If we do not let it die in China, then we must quickly overcome this crisis. How can we overcome this crisis? First, I think the comrades who lead this work must abandon the idea of emphasizing "China" and neglecting "foreign," must comprehensively consider the future development prospects of this science in China, and solicit the opinions of Chinese experts in this area to jointly formulate practical and feasible plans; second, I agree with Mr. Tang Yongtong's speech at the Academy of Sciences, placing the research base of philosophy history in the Department of Philosophy of Peking University; if the Philosophy Institute wants to share the research tasks in this area, then please find ways to tap its potential, and do not attempt to draw fuel from under the cauldron in the university by using so-called "part-time researchers"; third, I think the Ministry of Higher Education or other leading agencies should make efforts to solve the problem of purchasing books and periodicals. On the one hand, supplement the books and periodicals that should have been purchased in the past ten years, and on the other hand, ensure that there is a certain amount of foreign exchange to continue to purchase Western books and journals in the future. Fourth, I think we must recruit comrades from all over the country who are engaged in Western philosophy research. In addition to this, we must also cultivate more new forces in this area from graduate students or teaching assistants. I suggest to the Ministry of Higher Education that the establishment of philosophy departments within comprehensive universities should not be advanced rashly and should be stopped at the right time; China's existing talents for researching Western philosophy history are limited, too scattered, and it is useless and harmful to the development of this science.

I have written so much here, just to express our enthusiasm for the development prospects of the science of Western philosophy history. Many of the opinions are very immature. I hope that comrades will give more corrections, and I hope that comrades who love this science will work with us for the cause of philosophy history in New China.

    应该重视西方哲学史的研究
    洪谦
    最近北京大学中国哲学史教研室，科学院哲学研究所与人民大学哲学史教研室为了推进今后关于中国哲学史的研究工作，召集了全国性的“中国哲学史的工作会议”。这种会议对于中国哲学史的前途发展来说，是具有积极意义的。重“中”不应轻“外”
    我们一方面对于今后中国在哲学史研究方面的繁荣表示非常的欣慰，但另一方面回顾当前关于西方哲学史的研究条件，则不免有“相形见绌”之感。或者有人说：我们这种“自卑感”是根本不需要的，因为中国哲学是我国宝贵文化遗产之一，我们对于它当然应该特别的重视。至于关于西方哲学问题则有国际友人的哲学家们在那里研究，我们只须将他们研究所得的成果加以输入就行了。
    这样对于中国哲学史和西方哲学史在研究方面的看法，事实上已经支配了有些领导这方面工作的同志们的思想。例如在哲学方面的十二年远景规划中西方哲学史不仅不是今后研究重点之一，而且还将它附在东方哲学史的下面，在当前条件之下不把西方哲学史作为研究的重点，已经欠考虑，至于将它摆在东方哲学史之下，更是令人百思不得其解。还有例如科学院的哲学研究所自建所以来，即成立了“哲学史组”，然而在开始的二年间，在研究工作方面与西方哲学完全无关，而仅仅以中国哲学的问题作为唯一的对象。资产阶级的哲学史家往往以西方哲学史代表世界哲学史，现在我们则将中国哲学史（虽然动机不同）代表世界哲学史了。
    中国人应当重视我们的哲学文化遗产，应当将它作为研究的主要对象，这是完全正确的。但是我们似乎无须因而忽视西方哲学史的研究工作，忽视这门科学在哲学研究中的积极作用。我们不要忘却现在和今后对于中国哲学方面的研究，也与过去的“关起门来”“整理国故”大不相同，马克思主义的哲学思想已成了在它的研究方面的最高的指导原则。因此，就从这一点来说，我们也应该重视西方哲学史的研究。因为马克思主义哲学是西方哲学史中一个革命的发展，它与唯物主义对唯心主义斗争的历史过程有千丝万缕的联系，忽视了西方哲学史对于马克思主义是不能深入地了解的，因而对于中国哲学的研究工作也会带来损失的。
    那些同志们可以这样说，我们并不忽视西方哲学史的科学意义，而仅仅认为关于这方面的知识理论可以从国际友人的哲学家们（例如苏联和人民民主国家以及资本主义国家内进步的哲学家们）研究所得的成果接受过来的。这种看法是非常天真的，严格点说：是多少有些外行。因为以上所指那些国际友人的哲学家们所研究的问题，却带着他们不同的特殊性，因此他们对于这方面的研究成果不一定能满足我们实际的需要。诸如此类的研究成果，如果不加辨别地接受过来，对于西方哲学史在认识上和理论上的提高，是不会发生积极作用的。
    从当前哲学史的教学条件来说，我们关于这方面在认识上和理论上迫切需要通过研究而提高的对象，首先是过去成为哲学史中冷门的法国唯物主义哲学，其次是与马克思主义的辩证法发展直接有关的康德和黑格尔哲学，再次就是与现代资产阶级哲学关系比较密切的英国十七、八世纪的经验主义。还有柏拉图和亚里士多德的哲学，也应当在哲学史研究中占适当的地位。当然从孔德开始通过马赫和阿芬那留斯才流行起来的实证主义，还有现代资产阶级哲学各种主要学派如实用主义，逻辑实证论，现象学派和存在主义作为现代哲学史一些学派来研究，也是有其必要的。
    我们丝毫不轻视国际友人的哲学家们在哲学史方面的研究成果，相反地我们非常珍视他们的研究成果；我们今后在这方面研究工作的开展，更需要密切注意他们的研究工作，更需要他们对于我们在研究上大力的帮助。不过我们认为对这样重要的研究工作不想独立地进行，而完全倒向人家怀里的办法是不切实际的；我们认为只有在独立研究的基础之上才能正确地接受人家的研究成果，才能提高这方面的理论水平和研究风气。我们不能将思想理论当作一部机器可以简单从外国输入；就以一部机器来说：如果不具备相应的实际条件，就是运到了中国，还是开动不起来的。
    西方哲学史是一门科学，它作为科学与其他部门的历史科学，在本质上是完全相同的。从我们从事哲学工作者——不仅仅限于从事哲学工作者——来说，如果不以正确的态度来对待这门科学，那末在我们的哲学学习和科学研究方面是会带来许许多多的损失的。研究西方哲学史的重要性
    首先必须提出：如果我们不重视西方哲学的研究，则无法提高辩证唯物主义的学习水平（我认为结合西方哲学史和自然科学史来进行辩证唯物主义哲学的学习，是最好的学习方法）。过去或现在有些讲授辩证唯物主义的教师们忽视了这一点，所以只能干巴巴地对于辩证唯物论的几条基本原理作教条式的解释，而同学们也只能逐字逐句地对于这几条基本原理无精打采地接受。但是，如果我们从唯物主义的历史发展过程来讲解它的世界观的基本原理和实际内容，来讲解唯物主义者怎样应用辩证法这个思想武器与唯心主义作不调和的斗争；那末不仅可以避免以上所指出的那种学习情况，而且在讲授内容方面也能丰富多采起来，也能表现出辩证唯物主义原有的活生生的精神。
    据说莫斯科大学新近拟定的辩证唯物主义的学习计划是：一年级学习哲学史，二年级才开始学辩证唯物主义。我个人认为这种设施自有其理论上和实践上的理由，是非常明智的。在我们大学里面，如果实际条件允许，不妨可以试行这种办法。
    其次必须提出：五年以来在综合大学里已经逐渐地从马克思主义观点讲授西方哲学史。这种新型的西方哲学史的教学工作之能迅速而顺利地进行，总的说来，不能不归功于学习苏联在这方面的先进经验。但是我们当前哲学方面的实际情况毕竟与苏联有所不同，因此我们对于哲学史的有些问题，就不能将苏联已有的结论教条式搬过来，我们对于这些问题必须根据具体情况以实事求是的精神，通过科学研究去作出它们应得的结论。
    我们当前对于哲学史问题最感到棘手的，就是对一些唯心论的大哲学家的“评价”。我们认为对苏格拉底和柏拉图除了批判其唯心论观点之外，完全没有什么“价”可“评”的看法是不正确的；但是我们怎样才能对他们作出正确的“评价”呢？我们认为将柏克莱和休谟作为主观唯心论者或不可知论者全面地否定，这就忽视了柏克莱的视觉理论和休谟关于自然宗教学说的积极意义；但是我们怎样才能肯定他们这一方面，同时并不因而减轻他们对于唯物主义世界观的敌视呢？我们认为对于有些具有唯物论或辩证法因素的哲学家例如康德和黑格尔只肯定其这一方面，而将其思想体系的其他方面完全否定的看法，似乎还有考虑的必要；但是，我们怎样才能做到对他们作出科学的“评价”：一方面既保持着他们思想体系的完整，同时也贯彻了唯物主义的观点和方法呢？
    还有我们总认为形而上学的思想方法是“不科学的”；但是在马克思主义哲学形成以前，无论在科学中或哲学中，无论是唯物论者或唯心论者对于处理关于自然和社会的问题，基本上所应用的只是这种方法，难道这一切一切都是“不科学”的么？这样的一个问题以及上面所提出的那些问题，都不是简单地可以肯定或否定的。我们对这些问题必须切切实实做些研究工作之后，才能有发言的余地。
      再次必须提出：党和政府久已号召我们于十二年以内努力赶上国际的学术水平。关于国际的学术水平，从哲学方面来说，就是我们在这一方面所提出的问题和研究所得的成果在分量上能够用国际的一般学术标准来衡量。但是我敢大胆地说：根据这些年所发表的著作或论文的质量来判断，我们的哲学水平与国际上的距离还很遥远；我们的哲学水平到现在还没有完全脱离物质第一性或者精神第一性的教条式的解释，还周旋于老子是唯物论者还是唯心论者的思辩地混戏中间，我们要想在哲学方面于十二年内赶上国际的水平，还有待我们从事哲学工作者好好地努力。
      还有，虽然我们经常谈到哲学方面的国际水平，但是我们对于当前国际的哲学界实际情况所了解的实在不多。例如我们对于现在流行于资本主义国家中一些资产阶级哲学学派，如逻辑实证论，现象学派，存在主义或新托玛斯主义十年来的演变过程了解么？我也敢大胆地说：关于了解这方面的真实情况的人也是不多的。但是国际的学术水平不是关起门来谈的；我们必须随时注意国际的学术行市，然后才能抓住问题迎头地赶上去。因此我认为不仅对于马克思主义哲学形成以前的西欧古典哲学要进行研究，就是对于现代资产阶级哲学的一些主要学派也不应当简单地作为“一种帝国主义时代腐败、反动透顶的东西”排斥于研究领域之外；我们似乎还是需要对于它们作些研究和批判的。
    以上所指的三点已能说明研究西方哲学史的重要性，至于它作为研究哲学思想发展的客观规律的科学在人类知识领域中所起的作用，可以不必谈了。虽然关于西方哲学史的研究具有如此的重要性，但是从这门科学当前的研究条件来说，则是极其恶劣的。第一，旧中国这一方面并没有遗留下什么东西，关于这方面较有学术价值的著作既不多见，就是关于西方古典哲学著作译成为中文的为数也极少，而且其中有些译本在质量上也很差。解放后这几年来，虽然党和政府力图改变这种局面，但由于客观条件的限制，进展得比较迟缓。第二，解放以前，研究西方哲学和西方哲学史方面的同志本已寥寥无几，其中有些同志由于旧中国大学内宗派主义的横行，竟因找不到这方面适当的工作而改行业。解放以后，有些同志或者感到本身旧哲学包袱的沉重而从事语言方面的教学工作，或者由于工作岗位调动的困难；虽然有“归队”之心，但无“归队”之力，只能望洋兴叹而已。
    但是对于西方哲学史的研究最感到威胁的，则在于图书、期刊以及其他参考资料缺乏的严重情况。我们几乎有七年之久没有见到资本主义国家新近出版的图书和刊物。这一年来就以北京大学外国哲学史教研室来说，虽然订到几本关于哲学方面的期刊，但是我们企图购买的，迫切必需的西文参考书籍竟没有购到一本。我们从新出版的图书目录中明明知道柏克莱、休谟、康德、黑格尔的全集都已经陆续地出了新版本，然而我们仅能依靠三十年以前的旧版本，有时连这些旧版本的书还不易到手。现在关于研究西方哲学问题的一般情况，就是阅读无书，参考无书，老师们是如此，同学们也是如此。在这种情形之下，我们应付西方哲学史教学上的需要已经感到棘手，要想在这方面作比较深入的科学研究简直是不可能的。四　点　具体　建　议
    西方哲学史这门科学已经面临着危机，如果我们不让它在中国死亡下去，那末必须迅速地克服这种危机。我们怎样才能克服这种危机呢？第一，我认为领导这方面工作的同志们必须放弃重“中”轻“外”的思想，必须将这门科学在中国今后的发展前途作全面的考虑，并且征求这方面中国专家的意见，共同拟定切实可行的计划；第二，我同意汤用彤先生在科学院的发言，将哲学史的研究据点放在北京大学哲学系；如果哲学研究所要想分担这方面的研究任务，那末请它设法去发掘潜力，不要企图用所谓“兼任研究员”的办法在大学范围内釜底抽薪；第三，我认为高教部或其他领导机关应努力设法解决购买图书和期刊的问题。一方面将过去十年来应购的图书和期刊补充起来，另一方面保证今后有一定的外汇继续购买西方的图书和刊物。第四，我认为我们必须罗致全国从事西方哲学研究的同志们，在此之外，我们还须较多地从研究生或助教中培养这方面的新生力量。我向高教部建议，增设综合大学以内的哲学系不要冒进，要适可而止；中国现有关于研究西方哲学史方面的人材有限，过于分散，对于发展这门科学的事业来说，是无益而有害的。
    以上拉拉杂杂地写了这许多，无非表示我们对于西方哲学史这门科学的发展前途所抱的热望，其中许许多多的意见都是非常不成熟的，希望同志们多多地指正，更希望爱好这门科学的同志们与我们一起为新中国的哲学史事业而努力。
