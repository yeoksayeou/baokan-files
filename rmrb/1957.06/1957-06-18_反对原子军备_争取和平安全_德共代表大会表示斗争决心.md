Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 17th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on June 16th: The latest issue of "Freies Volk" published the communiqué of the German Communist Party Congress and the Congress's declaration: "Strive for Peace and Security, Oppose Atomic Armaments and Militarism."

The communiqué stated that, according to the decision of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the German Communist Party convened a congress a few days ago. One hundred and fifty-eight delegates attended the congress. Fraternal parties from the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, China, Eastern European People's Democracies, and some Western European countries also sent representatives to the meeting.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee. The discussion of the report demonstrated the German Communist Party's fighting determination and unwavering will. Although the German Communist Party was banned, it has continued to struggle successfully. The congress also reflected the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

The delegates unanimously adopted the German Communist Party Congress's outline: "Strive for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and Disarmament, Strive for Peace, Democracy and Social Progress in Germany." The Congress also decided to issue a letter to residents of West Germany.

At the close of the meeting, the Congress elected the Central Committee of the German Communist Party.

The Congress's declaration emphasized that the Adenauer government banned the German Communist Party because the communists had warned of the dangerous consequences of atomic armaments and called on residents to oppose the dangerous "brink of war" policy.

The German Communist Party Congress pointed out that the working class bears the greatest responsibility for peace and national destiny. Workers, trade unions, and the Party should concentrate all their efforts on protecting young people from the harm of militarism, opposing exploitation, and striving for the vital interests of all working people.

The German Communist Party Congress demanded that atomic weapons be cleared from German territory and that the West German Bundeswehr not be armed with atomic weapons; demanded that West Germany abolish compulsory military service and withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; demanded an immediate halt to all atomic weapons tests and a ban on weapons of mass destruction.

The declaration stated that as long as workers and all who desire peace unite in the great people's movement against atomic war and militarism, they will have the strength to crush the resistance of the ruling capitalists and militarists. This will make it possible to achieve political change in West Germany, preserve peace, guarantee freedom and progress, and open up the path to reunifying Germany into a democratic and progressive country.

The declaration also emphasized that the struggle against the banning of the German Communist Party is inseparable from all the above struggles. Restoring the legal status of the German Communist Party is a condition for realizing the national aspirations of all honest Germans for German unity.

　　反对原子军备　争取和平安全
    德共代表大会表示斗争决心
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社柏林16日讯：最近一期的“自由人民报”上刊登了德国共产党代表大会的公报和代表大会的宣言：“争取和平和安全，反对原子军备和军国主义”。
    公报说，根据中央委员会第二次全体会议的决定，德国共产党在前几天召开了代表大会，出席这次大会的有一百五十八名代表。民主德国、苏联、中国、东欧人民民主国家和西欧一些国家的兄弟党也派代表出席了会议。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼作了中央委员会的工作总结报告。对报告的讨论表明了德国共产党战斗的决心和坚定不移的意志，德国共产党虽然被取缔了，但是仍然成功地进行着斗争。代表大会还反映了无产阶级国际主义的精神。
    代表们一致通过了德国共产党代表大会的提纲：“争取禁止原子武器和裁减军备，争取德国的和平、民主和社会进步”。代表大会还决定发表告西德居民书。
    在会议闭幕的时候，代表大会选出了德国共产党中央委员会。
    代表大会的宣言着重指出，阿登纳政府所以取缔德国共产党，是因为共产党人曾经警告过原子军备的危险后果和号召居民反对危险的“战争边缘”政策。
    德国共产党代表大会指出，工人阶级对和平和民族命运负有最大的责任。工人、工会和党应该集中全力保护青年不受军国主义之害，反对剥削，争取全体劳动者的切身利益。
    德国共产党代表大会要求把原子武器清除出德国国境，不允许用原子武器武装西德国防军；要求西德取消义务兵役制和退出北大西洋公约组织；要求立即停止一切原子武器试验，禁止大规模毁灭性武器。
    宣言说道，只要劳动者和一切希望和平的人在反对原子战争和军国主义的伟大的人民运动中团结起来，就有力量粉碎资本主义与军国主义的执政者的反抗。这样就能够实现西德的政治改变，保住和平，保证自由和进步，开辟把德国重新统一成民主进步的国家的道路。
    宣言还强调指出，反对取缔德国共产党的斗争是同上述一切斗争分不开的。恢复德国共产党的合法地位，是实现一切正直的德国人对德国统一的民族要求的条件。
