Seven Years Compared to One Hundred Years
	"Calculation" Memorandum
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Feng

    In order to "calculate," to figure out whether "achievements are primary" is a fact or "dogmatism," this reporter visited several industrial economics experts at the State Statistical Bureau, asking them to compare industrial development before and after Liberation, to provide material for "calculation" and reference.

    The materials provided to the reporter by the experts were mostly comparisons of "impersonal" figures. But they fairly reflect the contrast between eras, the contrast between political systems, and the contrast in the achievements of those in power in leading industrial construction.

    Two Questions and Answers

    If the speed of industrial development and the amount of capital invested in industrial construction are taken as two important questions to assess the achievements of different rulers in leading industrial construction, then the answer to the first question is this: After about one hundred years of modern industrial development before Liberation, the total output value of modern industry accounted for 17% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. In the new China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the seven years from 1950 to last year, the proportion of the total output value of modern industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 22.1%, reaching 39.1%.

    Second question: Before Liberation, the industrial assets left to the new China totaled more than 9 billion yuan; a large part of which was national capital and imperialist capital. In the new China, under the condition of gradually improving people's living standards, the government's investment in the industrial sector in the first seven years was about 19.8 billion yuan; more than 10,000 large and small enterprises were newly built or renovated, of which 729 were large enterprises above the quota.

    The answers to the two questions raise a question for people: Why did the industrial development and capital investment in industrial construction in the seven years of the new China greatly exceed those in the one hundred years before Liberation? In the past seven years, gold and silver did not fall from the sky, machines did not grow from the ground, and God did not favor socialism; it seems that the correct answer can only be found in the political realm.

    Comparison of Several Industrial Developments

    China's construction of a modern iron and steel industry began in 1890 with the establishment of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant.

    This factory, equipped with two small blast furnaces, two small open-hearth furnaces, and two small converters, took four years to put into production. From then until 1948, for more than fifty years, China produced more than 7 million tons of steel. In contrast, the new China produced 14.33 million tons of steel in the first seven years. In fact, most of the more than 7 million tons of steel produced in old China were produced by factories established by Japan in Anshan, Benxi, Tangshan, Dalian, and Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of China. In 1927, when the Kuomintang reactionaries came to power, the national steel output was 30,000 tons. By 1934, it had only reached 50,000 tons, an increase of 20,000 tons in seven years. After 1935, the steel plants built by Japan in Anshan and other places were successively put into production, and the "nominal" steel output of old China (because most of it was controlled by Japan) gradually increased. The fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries increased steel production by 20,000 tons in seven years coincides with the fact that the Communist Party increased steel production from 160,000 tons to 4.46 million tons in 1956, making it a very easy-to-calculate account with a unified caliber.

    From 1861, when China established arsenals in Anqing and Shanghai, to 1936 (lacking subsequent data), after seventy-five years, China's metal processing industry, including the machinery industry, had a total of 18,000 machine tools. The technical level of the machinery industry in old China was more specifically described by a fact told to the reporter by a technician from Anshan Iron and Steel; the technician said that before Liberation, when certain parts on the blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel were damaged, they could not be repaired domestically and had to be shipped overseas to countries such as Japan for repair. In the first seven years after Liberation, China's metal processing industry sector had been equipped with 140,000 machine tools. China's machinery industry has been able to manufacture jet aircraft, automobiles, locomotives, and some precision machine tools and instruments, etc. Some products have been sold to the international market.

    Experts have not yet clarified the earlier production historical data for the modern coal and petroleum industries; in the fifty years before Liberation, China produced approximately more than one billion tons of coal and 2.8 million tons of petroleum. In the seven years after Liberation, 510 million tons of coal and 4.48 million tons of petroleum were produced.

    Examination of "Technical" Accounts

    Whether a factory director, or a government, is good at leading industrial production technology work, there are many aspects to assess, and the utilization rate of industrial equipment and the quota of raw material consumption can be used as two important "indicators."

    In the iron and steel industry, before Liberation, Anshan Iron and Steel had the highest equipment utilization rate. At that time, it was managed by Japan, which had the most developed industrial technology in Asia. In 1943, the equipment utilization rate of Anshan Iron and Steel was the highest. In that year, the blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel produced 0.54 tons of iron per cubic meter of volume per day and night; the open-hearth furnace produced 3.03 tons of steel per square meter of hearth area per day and night. In 1956, China's blast furnaces produced an average of 1.3 tons of iron per cubic meter, and open-hearth furnaces produced an average of 6.67 tons of steel per square meter of hearth area. That is to say, after restoration and reconstruction, in 1956 we could use the old China's 110,000+ cubic meters of blast furnace volume and 17,000 square meters of open-hearth furnace hearth area equipment to produce more than 3 million tons of iron and 2 million tons of steel than old China.

    In 1936, the utilization rate of China's power generation equipment, i.e., working hours, was approximately 2,940 hours, and the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was more than one kilogram. In 1956, the working time of power generation equipment in the Ministry of Electric Power Industry averaged 4,885 hours; the average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was 0.576 kilograms. That is to say, for power plants of the same capacity, the power generation of one power plant in the new China is equal to the power generation of two power plants in old China; the electricity generated by one ton of coal in the new China is almost twice as much as in 1936.

    The experts provided the reporter with many similar facts.

    The above facts reminded the reporter of a kind of argument in the two or three years before and after the founding of the new China. At that time, some people also said that the Communist Party could not lead science at all, and that the Communist Party could not lead industrial construction and production. Some of them said that the Communist Party would "grow sorghum" after taking over the blast furnace, and that "it would take at least 20 or 30 years to restore Anshan Iron and Steel," and so on. Their logic was: the Party does not understand technology, so the Party cannot lead technical work; and industrial production and construction is technical work. The above comparison of all facts cannot be said to be an important basis for making historical conclusions on this issue. Moreover, the above facts may also be used as a reference for the question of whether the Communist Party can lead science. Because the ideological logic of saying "the Communist Party cannot lead science" and "the Communist Party cannot lead technical work" is similar. If the two concepts of "technology" and "science" are similar in the field of natural science, or there is no essential boundary, if science also needs political leadership, and the Communist Party will also learn science, then what conclusion should be drawn from the saying "the Communist Party cannot lead science"?

    Incomparable Comparisons

    Chinese industrial historical data record that after the Opium War, imperialist factories and mines continued to appear in China. By 1936, 39% of China's industrial capital was owned by imperialism. At that time, the annual power generation of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company was 10% more than the power generation of all China's own power plants. According to the data of the 1950s, taking the national industrial product output as 100, the electricity produced by enterprises of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and imperialist countries accounted for 75, coal accounted for 87.7, petroleum accounted for 100, pig iron accounted for 96.1, steel accounted for 99.3, power machinery accounted for 62, cotton yarn accounted for 44, and cotton cloth accounted for 73. These numbers with colonial and semi-colonial imprints are no longer comparable today; an expert said that if it is necessary to compare with numbers, then the statistical table of the new China in this regard is "○". And the thousands of socialist enterprises that are jointly owned by the working class and the people of the whole country today cannot be found in the industrial historical data of old China. Most of the property of the national bourgeoisie, which comes from exploiting the working class, has been or is being transformed into the common property of the working class or the people. This is also incomparable to the past.

    Aside

    Or some people say that the slow development of industry in old China was because China's capitalist system was not completely "unbound," there was feudalism; shackles were once fettered on its feet, and there was imperialism. What about the "unbound" industrial development of the United States, Britain, and France, the imperialist countries with one or two hundred years of history, compared with China?

    Experts on world economic issues here, based on materials published by the United Nations and the European Economic Cooperation Organization, estimated that in the eight years from 1949 to 1956, taking 1948 as 100, the United States' industrial growth was 37, Britain's was 36, and France's was 61. The average annual growth rate of industry was 4 for the United States, 3.9 for Britain, and 6.1 for France. Due to the stimulus of the Korean War and the reduction of industrial production in 1949, the United States' industrial growth in 1950 was 17%. In the remaining seven years, the highest annual growth rate was 12. In these eight years, the United States' industry declined by 7% to 8% compared with the previous year in two years. Britain and France also each declined by 3% in one year. As a result of Britain's efforts last year, industrial growth was 0%.

    This is a brief overview of the industrial development of the United States, Britain, and France in the recent eight years in "local wars" and tense military preparations.

    The industry of the new China (including handicrafts) increased more than five times in 1956 compared with 1949, and more than doubled compared with the year before the Five-Year Plan; the average rate of industrial development in seven years was 25.9. During these seven years, the speed of industrial development in our country also had its ups and downs, but there was no decline. Due to the major flood in 1954, 1955 was the slowest year for industrial development in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan. But it still increased by 6%.

    In recent years, in interviews in central government agencies, reporters often encounter responsible cadres who do not like to publicize the achievements of their departments. They say that we should "look forward" and not compare the achievements made under the socialist system with those of countries with social systems that have been overthrown by the people or are not liked by the people. Some people also say that old materials are not news. However, judging from the recent "calculation," some people seem to have consciously forgotten the facts not long ago, and they are still nostalgic for the social system that has been overthrown by the people. The ancients have a saying: "Reviewing the old and knowing the new." Therefore, old materials are also recorded here for "calculation" and reference.

　　七年比一百年
    “算账”备忘录
　　新华社记者  李峰
    为了“算账”，为了算算“成绩是主要的”是事实还是“教条主义”，记者访问了国家统计局的一些工业经济专家，请他们把解放前后工业发展的情况，作个比较，供“算账”备考。
    专家们向记者提供的材料，多半是没有“人情味道”的数字的对比。但它公正地反映着时代的对比，政治制度的对比，执政者领导工业建设的成绩对比。
    两个试题和答案
    工业发展速度和投入工业建设的资金数量，如果作为考核不同的执政者领导工业建设的成就的两个重要试题，那么，第一个试题的答案是这样：解放前，我国近代工业发展了大约一百年的结果，现代工业总产值占工农业总产值的17％。新中国在共产党领导下，从1950年到去年，七年的时间，现代工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重，提高了22.1％，达到了39.1％。
    第二试题。解放前一百年，留给新中国的工业资产，共九十多亿元；其中有很大一部分是民族资本和帝国主义的资本。新中国在人民生活水平逐渐提高的条件下，政府前七年用于工业部门的投资，约一百九十八亿元；新建或改建的大小企业共一万个以上，其中限额以上的大企业就有七百二十九个。
    两个试题的答案向人们提出一个问题：新中国七年工业的发展和投入工业建设的资金，为什么还大大超过解放前一百年呢？近七年上天没有降金落银，地下没有长出机器，老天爷对社会主义也并不偏爱，七年闹了三次大灾害；看来只能在政治领域里才能找到正确的回答。
    几种工业发展的对比
    中国建设近代钢铁工业，是从1890年创办汉阳钢铁厂开始。
    这个设有两座小高炉、两个小平炉和两个小转炉的工厂，建设了四年才投入生产。从那时起，到1948年，五十多年的时间，中国生产了七百多万吨钢。而新中国前七年就生产了一千四百三十三万吨钢。实际上，旧中国生产的七百多万吨钢，绝大部分是日本侵占中国期间，日本在鞍山、本溪、唐山、大连和上海建立的工厂生产的。国民党反动派登台的1927年，全国钢产量是三万吨，到1934年，才达到五万吨，七年的时间增加了两万吨。1935年以后，日本在鞍山等地建设的钢铁厂陆续投入生产，旧中国“名义上”的钢产量（因为大部分掌握在日本手里）才逐渐提高。国民党反动派执政那七年增加两万吨钢的事实，同共产党执政七年由十六万吨钢提高到1956年四百四十六万吨的事实，巧合成一笔口径统一十分好算的账目。
    从1861年我国在安庆和上海建立军械所起，到1936年（缺以后的资料），经过七十五年的时间，中国包括机械工业在内的金属加工工业拥有的机床，共一点八万台。旧中国机械工业的技术水平，鞍钢一位技术人员曾经告诉记者的事实，比用数字说得更具体些；那位技术人员说，解放以前，鞍钢高炉上的某些部件损坏时，国内不能修，要远渡重洋，到日本等国家修理。解放后前七年，我国金属加工工业部门已经装备了十四万台机床。我国机械工业，已经能制造喷气式飞机、汽车、机车和一些精密的机床及仪表等。有些产品已经远销国际市场。
    近代的煤炭和石油工业，更早的生产史料，专家们还未查清；解放前五十年的时间，中国大约生产了十亿多吨煤和二百八十万吨石油。解放后七年生产了五亿一千万吨煤和四百四十八万吨石油。
    “技术”账考
    一个工厂厂长，或则一个政府，是否善于领导工业生产技术工作，考核的方面很多，工业设备利用程度和原材料消耗定额，可以作为两个重要“指标”。
    在钢铁工业方面，解放以前，鞍钢的设备利用程度最高。那时，它是亚洲工业技术最发达的日本经营。1943年，是鞍钢的设备利用程度最高的一年。这一年，鞍钢的高炉每立方公尺容积每昼夜生产零点五四吨铁；平炉每平方公尺炉底面积每昼夜生产三点零三吨钢。1956年，我国高炉平均每立方公尺生产一点三吨铁；平炉平均每平方公尺炉底面积生产六点六七吨钢。这就是说，经过恢复和改建，我们1956年用旧中国留下来的十一万多立方公尺的高炉容积和一点七万平方公尺的平炉炉底面积的设备，可以比旧中国多生产三百多万吨铁和二百多万吨钢。
    1936年中国发电设备利用程度即工作时间，大约二千九百四十小时，每度电用煤量在一公斤以上。1956年电力工业部发电设备的工作时间，平均是四千八百八十五小时；每度电平均用煤量是零点五七六公斤。这就是说，同样大能力的发电厂，新中国一个电厂的发电量，等于旧中国两个电厂的发电量；新中国用一吨煤发出的电，比1936年多将近一倍。
    类似的事实，专家们还向记者提供了很多。
    上述事实，使记者想起了新中国成立前后两三年的一种论调。那时，也有些人说共产党根本不能领导科学一样，说共产党不能领导工业建设和生产。他们有的说，共产党接收高炉“去种高粱吧”，“恢复鞍钢至少要二三十年”，等等。他们的逻辑是：党不懂技术，所以党不能领导技术工作；而工业生产建设是技术性的工作。上述一切事实的对比，不能说不是对此问题作历史结论的重要依据。而且，上述事实，对共产党能不能领导科学的问题，或许也可资参考。因为说“共产党不能领导科学”和“共产党不能领导技术工作”的思想逻辑是近似的。如果“技术”和“科学”这两个概念在自然科学领域里是近似的，或者本质上划不出界限，如果科学也需要政治领导，科学也会让共产党学会，那么，“共产党不能领导科学”的说法，又应该得出什么结论呢？
    对不上口径的对比
    中国工业史料记载，从鸦片战争以后，中国不断出现帝国主义的厂矿，到1936年，中国的工业资本中39％为帝国主义所有。当时上海美商电力公司全年的发电量，比我国全部自有电厂发电量还多10％。据二十世纪五十年代的资料，以全国的工业品产量为一百，官僚资产阶级和帝国主义国家的企业生产的电占七十五，煤占八七·七，石油占一百，生铁占九六·一，钢占九九·三，动力机占六十二，棉纱占四十四，棉布占七十三。这些有殖民地半殖民地烙印的数字，同今天已经无法可比；一位专家说，如果一定要用数字对比，那么，这方面新中国的统计表上是“○”。而今天工人阶级和全国人民所公有的成千上万的社会主义的企业，在旧中国工业史料里也找不到一个。民族资产阶级来自剥削工人阶级的大部分财产，已经或正在变为工人阶级或人民公有。这也同过去无法对比。
　　题外篇
    或者有人说，旧中国工业发展的缓慢，是因为中国的资本主义制度，没有完全“放脚”，有封建；脚上曾羁绊着脚镣，有帝国主义。那些“放了脚”的工业发展有一二百年历史的美、英、法帝国主义国家同中国相比又如何呢？
    此间世界经济问题专家，根据联合国和欧洲经济合作组织发表的材料推算，从1949年到1956年八年当中，以1948年为一百，美国工业增长三十七，英国增长三十六，法国增长六十一。工业平均每年增长的速度，美国是四，英国是三点九，法国是六点一。美国由于侵朝战争的刺激和1949年工业减产，1950年工业增长了17％，其余七年，每年最高增长速度是十二。在这八年之中，美国工业有两年比前一年倒退了7％到8％。英国和法国也各有一年倒退3％。英国去年努力的结果，工业增长了0％。
    这是美英法三国近八年在“局部战争”和紧张的军事备战中工业发展的简况。
    新中国的工业（包括手工业），1956年比1949年增长五倍以上，比五年计划前一年增长一倍多；七年工业发展的平均速度是二十五点九。这七年期间，我国工业发展的速度也有快有慢，但并没有倒退现象。由于1954年大水灾，1955年是五年计划前四年工业发展最慢的一年。但仍然增长了6％。
    近年来，记者在中央机关采访中，常常碰到不喜欢宣传本部门成就的负责干部。他们说，应该“向前看”，不必把在社会主义制度下取得的成就同被人民推翻的或人民不喜欢的社会制度的国家相比。有人还说旧材料不是新闻。但是，从最近“算账”中看来，有些人像是有意识地忘掉了不久以前的事实，而且对于人民推翻了的社会制度，还恋念不忘。古人有训：“温故知新”。故将旧材料也录于此，供“算账”备考。
