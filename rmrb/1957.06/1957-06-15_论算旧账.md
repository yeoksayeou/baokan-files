On Settling Old Scores

Editor's Note: Yesterday, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "On Settling Old Scores," refuting the fallacy put forward by Chen Renbing, Deputy Chairman and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, that old scores must be settled in this rectification movement (the content of which can be found on page two of today's newspaper). The full text of the editorial is as follows:

Chen Renbing raised the issue of settling old scores. According to him, "for the sake of the Party and the future of the motherland," it is necessary to settle old scores. Who does Chen Renbing want to settle accounts with? Is it with imperialism? Is it with the landlord class? Is it with the reactionary elements who have long oppressed and exploited the Chinese people? None of these. Then who is it with? It turns out that he wants to take advantage of the rectification movement to settle old scores with the Communist Party. Because, supposedly, "some comrades who have made mistakes are most fond of using opposition to settling old scores to cover up their own mistakes." If you do not agree with settling old scores, then you cannot escape the suspicion of covering up your mistakes, and you cannot escape the charge of not being "for the sake of the Party and the future of the motherland." It seems that old scores must be settled.

Do we agree with settling old scores?

We both agree and disagree.

If it is said that we are dealing with the enemy, we advocate settling accounts, old accounts must be settled, and new accounts must also be settled; small accounts must be settled, and big accounts must be settled even more. Not only must we settle them, but we must settle them clearly, and they must be repaid. If the enemy does not repay the debt, we will force him to repay it. If he says he will not repay it, we will take action, if words don't work, we will use force, until the enemy pays it off. In this regard, we, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, have always been unambiguous. This has long been confirmed by historical facts. It should be stated that even for the enemy, including the armed enemy, as long as he lays down his weapons, we still advocate not settling old scores, implementing a lenient policy, and giving him the opportunity to start anew. This is also a historical fact that has long been proven.

If it is said that we are dealing with friends, we not only do not agree with settling old scores, but we also advocate not keeping accounts. Because since we are friends, there are bound to be things in common, and there are also bound to be things that are inconsistent, there are pleasant gatherings, and there are also unpleasant disputes, and even situations where A "offends" B, B "offends" C, or C "offends" A. Starting from this actual situation, we advocate putting unity first, clarifying the issues, not keeping accounts with friends, getting along amicably, and working together to do things well. Some of our friends have made mistakes in the past, but as long as they have recognized their mistakes and have made corrections, we do not advocate settling old scores, uniting as one, and doing a good job in our common cause. Because we are communists, we know that the cause of communism is by no means the private affair of a few communists, and the more friends we have on this road, the better. If we keep accounts with friends and settle old scores, it is not in line with our moral standards. Some of our comrades do not understand this spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and harbor sectarian sentiments towards some friends. This is what the Party often opposes, and it is also what needs to be resolved in this rectification movement.

As for talking about ourselves, we keep accounts and we settle accounts. As long as you look at our Party's historical documents, comrades will see that we have never covered up or concealed the mistakes we have made. Not only do we not cover up small mistakes, but we also do not conceal the line errors that our Party has made. Not only do we not cover up past mistakes, but we also constantly expose the mistakes in various tasks, because our Party is responsible to the people, so not only do various organs regularly summarize their work, but in various political movements and social reforms since liberation, we have never forgotten to rectify our own ranks, affirm our achievements, correct our mistakes, and constantly learn from them and draw lessons to do our work better, and after the great social changes, the Party Central Committee promptly proposed the rectification movement. Therefore, we are not afraid of Chen Renbing's proposal to settle old scores. We not only warmly welcome constructive criticisms (including many incorrect criticisms) put forward by all sincere friends, but also confidently welcome the challenges of any right-wing elements.

Now the right-wing elements have presented the Communist Party with a bill. They say that since liberation, the heroic and diligent struggles of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party have not achieved anything. Whoever says that "achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings and mistakes are secondary" is "dogmatism" and "Party jargon," and is "covering up mistakes." In their view, the Chinese people overthrew imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, liberated all of China, implemented land reform, eliminated feudal rule, and implemented socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts. These are not achievements, these are all mistakes; before liberation, China only produced hundreds of thousands of tons of steel per year (according to Kuomintang China, only 40,000 tons were produced, the rest were produced by the Japanese in Northeast China), and now produces 4.5 million tons of steel. This is not an achievement either, this is also a mistake. Isn't this absurd? Actually, it's not surprising. Chiang Kai-shek's downfall is seen by the Chinese people as a great liberation and a great achievement, while Chiang Kai-shek and his masters see it as a great disaster and a great mistake; land reform is seen by workers and peasants as a great achievement, while landlords see it as going to hell, as a great mistake; the victory of socialist transformation and socialist construction is seen by those who support socialism as a great achievement, while those who oppose socialism see it as a great sin. Everyone has different positions and different viewpoints. The same is true of settling old scores, but two different results are obtained. What's so strange about that?

Chen Renbing has not yet publicly written out his bill, but it is easy for discerning people to see what accounts he is settling and what his purpose is in settling accounts. Don't you see, isn't he already "sighing deeply"? If his settlement of accounts results in seeing achievements, and also seeing shortcomings, and he also believes that these shortcomings can be overcome and errors can be corrected, then why "sigh deeply" to the point of thinking of "weeping bitterly"? Don't you see, hasn't he already demanded that "a few people" be "picked out" for "effective" handling? If he starts from the desire for unity, if he still believes that these comrades, although they have made mistakes, can be educated, why is he so hostile to these cadres? If it is said that a few cadres have made mistakes and should be handled in this way, and the entire Communist Party has been "fundamentally wrong and achieved only secondary results" for several years, then shouldn't they also be "picked out" for handling? From his enthusiasm for "settling accounts" and "removing cadres" everywhere, are we exaggerating at all to say this?

We say that we are not afraid of settling old scores and are not afraid of challenges from right-wing elements. This is not only because we firmly believe that the achievements of the Communist Party cannot be overthrown, because the achievements of the Communist Party's work are first and foremost the achievements of the Chinese people's heroic labor, and the people can see it clearly. We also firmly believe that the shortcomings and errors in our work must be corrected and can be completely corrected, because phenomena such as bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism are not the products of the working class and the Communist Party themselves, nor are they the products of the social system itself, but are the products left to us by the old society, and have their historical and social roots. We have no attachment to this legacy, we do not want to rely on it to live our lives, but constantly and resolutely fight against it. In this regard, we are different from Chen Renbing. We believe that after the rectification, we will certainly be able to greatly reduce the poison of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and continue to fight against phenomena that endanger the cause of the Party and the people after the rectification movement is over, and our work will be done better and better. Therefore, while we are fighting against the anti-socialist words and deeds of right-wing elements, we will never stop the rectification movement. We welcome friends outside the Party to continue to help us with the rectification. We will treat all well-intentioned criticisms, including those that are not completely correct or even wrong, seriously and solemnly, because this is a principled distinction from those destructive criticisms.

The Chinese people have experienced a great revolutionary victory and entered the ninth year of victory. The people are joyfully welcoming new victories, while some people are "sighing deeply" and "weeping bitterly." Is this a new account or an old account? Let our readers judge.

### 论算旧账

　　论算旧账
    编者按：昨天的上海解放日报发表了一篇题为“论算旧账”的社论，针对民盟上海市委副主任委员兼秘书长陈仁炳所提出的在这次整风运动中须要算旧账的谬论（内容见今日本报第二版），给予了驳斥。社论全文如下：
    陈仁炳提出了算旧账的问题。据他说，“为了党和祖国的前途，”需要算算旧账。陈仁炳要向谁算账呢？是向帝国主义吗？是向地主阶级吗？是向长期压迫剥削中国人民的反动分子吗？都不是。那是向谁呢？原来是要借整风的机会，同共产党算一算旧账。因为，据说“有的犯了错误的同志，最喜欢用反对算旧账来遮掩他自己的错误。”你如果不赞成算旧账，那就无法逃避掩盖自己的错误的嫌疑，而且就无法逃避不“为了党和祖国的前途”的罪名。看来，旧账是非算不可了。
    我们是不是赞成算旧账呢？
    我们是又赞成又不赞成。
    如果说是对敌人，我们是主张算账的，旧账要算，新账也要算；小账要算，大账更要算。不但要算，而且要算清，要偿还。如果敌人欠账不还，我们就强迫他还。用嘴讲要不还，就动手，文的不行，来武的，直到敌人还清为止。在这方面，我们中国共产党和中国人民是一向不马虎的。这早已为历史事实所证实了。应当说明，就是对敌人，包括武装的敌人，只要他放下武器，我们仍然主张不算旧账，实行宽大政策，给予重新作人的机会，这也是历史事实早已证明了的。
    如果说是对朋友，我们不但不赞成算老账，而且主张不记账。因为既然是朋友，就不免有一致的地方，又有不一致的地方，有愉快的欢聚，又有不愉快的争执，甚至有甲“得罪了”乙，乙“得罪了”丙，或者丙“得罪了”甲的情况。从这种实际情况出发，我们主张以团结为重，把问题说清楚，不记朋友的账，友好相处，共同把事情办好。我们的朋友，有的在历史上犯过错误，只要他已经认识了错误，并且有了改正，我们不主张算旧账，团结一致，把共同的事业办好。因为我们是共产主义者，我们知道，共产主义的事业绝不是少数共产党员的私事，在这条道路上，朋友越多越好。如果对朋友记账，算老账，是不符合我们的道德标准的。我们有些同志对于这种求同存异的精神领会不够，对有些朋友抱有宗派主义情绪，这是党经常反对的，也是这次整风中要解决的。
    至于讲到对我们自己，我们是记账的，也是算账的。只要看一看我们党的历史文件，同志们就会看到：我们从来没有掩盖过、隐瞒过我们曾经犯过的错误。不但不掩盖小的错误，而且不隐瞒我们的党曾经犯过路线错误。不但不掩盖过去的错误，而且经常地揭露各项工作中的错误，因为我们的党是对人民负责的，所以，不但各个机关经常总结工作，解放以来在各项政治运动和社会改革中，我们都不曾忘记整顿自己的队伍，肯定成绩，纠正错误，不断地从中吸取经验教训，把工作作得更好，而在社会大变动以后，党中央又及时地提出了整风运动。因此，陈仁炳提出要算旧账，我们并不惧怕。我们不但热诚地欢迎一切真诚的朋友所提出的建设性的批评（包括许多不正确的批评），而且信心百倍地迎接任何右派分子的挑战。
    现在右派分子给共产党开出了一个账单。他们说，解放以来，中国人民在共产党领导下所进行的英勇的勤劳的斗争是没有成绩的，谁如果说“成绩是主要的，缺点、错误是次要的”，那就是“教条主义”“党八股”，就是“遮掩错误”。在他们看来，中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，解放了全中国，实行了土地改革，消灭了封建统治，实行了对资本主义工商业、农业、手工业的社会主义改造，这都不算成绩，这都算错误；解放以前，中国每年只生产几十万吨钢（按国民党中国只生产四万多吨，其余是日本人在东北生产的），现在生产四百五十万吨钢，这也不算成绩，这也算错误。这岂不荒唐？其实，也并不奇怪。蒋介石垮台，中国人民看作是大解放，大成绩，蒋介石和他的主子则看作是大灾难，大错误；土地改革，工人农民看作是很大的成绩，地主则看作是下地狱，是大错误；社会主义改造和社会主义建设的胜利，拥护社会主义的人看作是很大的成绩，反对社会主义的人则看作是很大的罪过。各人立场不同，观点不同，同是算旧账，却得出两种结果。这又有什么奇怪呢？
    陈仁炳还没有公开写出他的账单，但是他在算什么账，算账的目的是什么，明眼的人是容易看出的。君不见，他不是已经在那里“长太息”吗？如果他算账的结果，看到了成绩，也看到了缺点，他又相信这些缺点是可以克服的，错误是可以纠正的，那又何必“长太息”以至想到“痛哭流涕”呢？君不见，他不是已经要求“挑出几个人”来加以“有效”的处理吗？如果他是从团结的愿望出发，如果他还相信这些同志虽然犯了错误，却是可以教育的，为什么他对这些干部是那样地仇视呢？如果说几个干部犯了错误要这么办，整个共产党几年来又是“错误是基本的、成绩是次要的”，那不是也应当“挑出来”加以处理吗？从他到处热心“算账”“撤干部”来看，我们这样说，难道是毫无根据的夸张吗？
    我们说我们不怕算旧账，不怕右派分子挑战，这不但因为我们深信：共产党的成就是算不倒的，因为共产党的工作成就首先是中国人民英勇劳动的成就，人民是看得清楚的，而且我们深信，我们工作中的缺点和错误是必须改正，也是完全可以改正的，因为像官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义等等现象，并不是工人阶级和共产党本身的产物，并不是社会制度本身的产物，而是旧社会遗留给我们的产物，是有它的历史根源和社会根源的。我们对这笔遗产并无任何留恋，我们并不想靠他过日子，而是不断地坚决地同它作斗争。在这方面，我们同陈仁炳不同。我们相信，经过整风，我们一定能够使官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的污毒大大减少，并且在整风运动结束以后，继续同危害党和人民的事业的现象作斗争，我们的工作会越作越好。因此，我们在同右派分子的反社会主义的言论和行为作斗争的同时，我们绝不停止整风运动，我们欢迎党外的朋友们继续帮助我们整风，一切善意的批评，包括不完全正确的、甚至错误的批评，我们都会认真地严肃地对待，因为这是同那些破坏性的批评有原则性的区别的。
    中国人民经历了伟大的革命胜利，进入了第九个胜利的年份，人民在欢乐地迎接新的胜利，而有人在那里“长太息”在那里“痛哭流涕”，这是一笔新账，还是旧账，让我们的读者去判断吧。
