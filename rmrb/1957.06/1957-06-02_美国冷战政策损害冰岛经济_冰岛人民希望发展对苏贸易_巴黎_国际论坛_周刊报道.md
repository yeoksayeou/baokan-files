Xinhua News Agency, May 31st – The Paris "International Forum" weekly recently published a dispatch describing many contradictory phenomena in Iceland's political and economic life.

The dispatch stated that the most prominent of these contradictions is directly related to the United States' Cold War policy. Because of its Cold War agenda, the United States has made Iceland a major stronghold for its strategic deployment, which has led most Icelanders to oppose the United States and lean towards communism.

Since 1939, the United States has invested 150 million US dollars in Iceland's military facilities. This has brought profound changes to Iceland's economy. On the one hand, it has enabled Iceland to use US loans or grants to develop its own industry, but on the other hand, it has also caused instability and difficulties in the Icelandic economy, mainly reflected in frequent currency devaluations (averaging 10% per year since 1947) and rising prices (currently 500% higher than in 1939).

A more direct result of the US's large-scale construction of bases in Iceland and Iceland's industrialization is the growth of Iceland's industrial proletariat. In Iceland, the Communist Party's position is consolidated. A communist serves as the Minister of Fisheries in the government: a key position in a country where fish products account for 96% of exports.

The dispatch concluded by pointing out that while the Icelandic coalition government hopes to use US dollars to help it overcome economic difficulties, most residents seem to believe that saving the economy should rely on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has already become Iceland's largest buyer. Five years ago, Soviet purchases of fish accounted for only 7% of the fish caught by the Icelandic fleet, but today they account for 40%. It is generally believed that developing trade between the two countries will allow Iceland's industrialization to have a healthier foundation.

    美国冷战政策损害冰岛经济  冰岛人民希望发展对苏贸易
    ——巴黎“国际论坛”周刊报道——
    据新华社31日讯　巴黎“国际论坛”周刊最近发表了一篇通讯，描述了冰岛在政治和经济生活方面的许多矛盾现象。
    这篇通讯说，矛盾的最突出的现象是直接同美国的冷战政策有关系的。因为要搞冷战，美国使冰岛成为美国战略部署的一个主要据点，而大多数冰岛人也就因此反对美国，倾向共产主义。
    自从1939年以来，美国为冰岛的军事设施投资一亿五千万美元。这使冰岛的经济发生深刻的变化。一方面，它使冰岛有可能利用美国的贷款或赠款发展自己的工业，但是另方面，也引起了冰岛经济的不稳定和困难，这主要表现在经常的货币贬值（从1947年以来，平均每年贬值10％）和物价上涨（同1939年比，目前物价上升至500％）。
    美国为冰岛基地大兴土木和冰岛工业化的更直接的结果是：冰岛的工业无产阶级壮大了。在冰岛，共产党的地位是巩固的。一个共产党员在政府中担任渔业部长：在鱼类产品占出口的96％的一个国家，这是一个要职。
    这篇通讯最后指出：假如说冰岛联合政府期望用美国的美元来帮助它克服经济困难，那么大多数居民看来，挽救经济应该依靠苏联。苏联已经成为冰岛的最大买主，五年前苏联购买的鱼在冰岛船队所捕的鱼中只占7％，今天已经占40％。一般都认为：这两国发展贸易，将可以使冰岛的工业化有更为健康的基础。
