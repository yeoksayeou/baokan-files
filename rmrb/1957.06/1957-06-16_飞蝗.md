　　Migratory Locust
    The migratory locust is one of the most serious pests in China's agricultural production. As early as 707 BC, locust plagues were recorded in Chinese history. In the more than 2,600 years since then, there have been more than 800 locust plagues, averaging one every three years.
    The distribution of migratory locusts in China is roughly divided into three locust areas: coastal, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. In years of large-scale locust outbreaks, large numbers of migratory locusts will fly in swarms from the locust areas, covering the sky and sun, to various places. In 1933, migratory locusts from the coastal locust area spread to 265 counties in nine provinces.
    In North and East China, migratory locusts generally have two generations per year, the first generation being called summer locusts, and the second generation being called autumn locusts. The larvae of migratory locusts—the locust nymphs—shed their skin five times during development, totaling five instars (hatching from the soil is called the first instar, shedding the first skin is called the second instar, and each subsequent shedding increases the instar by one, transforming into adults after shedding the fifth skin).
    Locust nymphs are very active during the fourth and fifth instars. Fifth-instar locust nymphs can jump forward more than 20 city feet per minute and can swim continuously in water for 13 to 28 hours. During the fourth and fifth instars, their distribution area can generally expand several times or dozens of times. Migratory locusts have extremely strong flying ability and can continue to fly for more than a day when migrating, and can also fly at night. The food consumption of migratory locusts is generally two to three hundred times greater than that of locust nymphs before the third instar. Therefore, the harmfulness of migratory locusts is even greater.
    Since liberation, the state has attached great importance to locust control work. Since 1953, specialized locust control agencies have been established in locust-affected provinces, and large amounts of prevention and control funds have been allocated annually. In order to eliminate locusts, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute have conducted experimental research in both northern and southern locust areas in conjunction with prevention and control.

　　飞蝗
    飞蝗是我国农业生产中为害最严重的一种害虫。远在公元前七○七年，我国历史上就有蝗灾的记载。两千六百多年以来，曾发生蝗灾八百多次，平均每三年一次。
    我国飞蝗的分布大致分为：沿海、新疆和台湾三个蝗区。蝗虫大发生的年代，大量飞蝗就会从蝗区遮天蔽日地成群远飞各处。1933年沿海蝗区的飞蝗曾蔓延到九个省的二百六十五个县。
    华北、华东地区的飞蝗，一般每年发生两代，第一代叫夏蝗；第二代叫秋蝗。飞蝗的幼虫——蝗蝻，发育期间先后脱皮五次，共五龄（孵化出土叫一龄，脱第一次皮叫二龄，以后每脱皮一次增加一龄，脱第五次皮后变成成虫）。
    蝗蝻在四、五龄期活动能力很强。五龄蝗蝻每分钟能向前跳进二十多市尺，能连续在水中游泳十三到二十八小时。它的分布面积，在四、五龄期间，一般能扩散几倍或几十倍。飞蝗的飞翔力极强，迁移的时候可以继续飞行一天以上，并且可以夜间飞翔。飞蝗的食量比三龄以前的蝗蝻一般大二、三百倍。因此，飞蝗的为害性更大。
    解放以后，国家十分重视灭蝗工作。从1953年起，在蝗区各省建立了治蝗专业机构，逐年拨付大批防治经费。为消灭蝗虫，中国科学院和华北农业科学研究所已分别在南北蝗区结合防治进行了试验研究。
