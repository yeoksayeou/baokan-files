    Xinhua News Agency, Liverpool, 4th: Former British Prime Minister Eden returned to England by ship from Canada on the 3rd.
    After resigning as Prime Minister due to the failure of the Suez policy, Eden left England on January 18 for a "vacation" in New Zealand, and soon went to Boston in the United States for abdominal surgery; since then, he has been recuperating in Canada.
    Eden said that he will never participate in political life in the future, but this does not mean that he will not express his opinions on a few matters. When talking about the Suez policy, he said that he still believes in some of the things he said about this issue in the past.

    艾登回到英国
    据新华社4日讯　利物浦消息：英国前首相艾登3日从加拿大乘船回到英国。
    艾登由于苏伊士政策的失败而辞去首相职务以后，在1月18日离开英国去新西兰“休假”，不久又到美国波士顿去动腹部手术；这之后一直在加拿大养病。
    艾登说，他今后将永不参加政治生活，但是这并不等于他在少数事情上不发表意见。他在谈到苏伊士政策的时候说，他仍然相信他过去在这个问题上所说的一些话。
