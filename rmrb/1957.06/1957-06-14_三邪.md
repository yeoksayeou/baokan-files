　　Three Evils
　　Lao She
　　Facts have proven that the Chinese Communist Party is the most sincere party. Otherwise, why would it ask non-Party members to help rectify the Party? If it wanted a "Party-dominated world," would it be so naive as to ask others to help rectify the Party? Or would it be in such a hurry to rectify the Party?
　　Friends, since the Party is so sincere, can we betray the Party's trust and entrustment? Since the Party is sincere to us, we must also be sincere to the Party, speaking our minds and raising our opinions based on our conscience. By treating each other with sincerity and speaking frankly, the Party will lead us more wisely, and we will be happier. The Party prospers, we prosper; the Party collapses, we collapse, no one can escape!
　　There are more than ten million Party members, and it's impossible for them all to be perfect. Among them, there are the very best, some who are not so good, and even a few who are not upright. Therefore, the Party needs rectification and everyone's help. However, we cannot judge the Party as bad because of the bad deeds of one or a few Party members. The saying "one bad apple spoils the whole barrel" doesn't apply here. The Party has its own discipline and has never allowed one bad apple to spoil the whole barrel. Otherwise, the Party would have already become corrupt and would not have the prestige and achievements it has today.
　　Party members are also human beings. They may do one thing right and another thing wrong; otherwise, why would there be a need for rectification? We should point out their mistakes, which is our responsibility to help rectify the Party. However, we cannot deny their merits because of their mistakes, which is unfair; we should not negate the entire Party because of the mistake of one Party member, no matter how serious.
　　Since the rectification of the Party is to be carried out gently, we who are helping to rectify the Party should also be calm, speak the truth, offer serious criticism, and make more constructive suggestions. On the contrary, if we seize the opportunity, regardless of right and wrong, to negate everything, then we are not helping to rectify the Party, but are deliberately dismantling the Party. The Party is the savior of the Chinese people, it was in the past, it is now, and no one will forget it in the future, forever. Such a Party cannot be overthrown or dismantled. Moreover, what good would it do us if the Party collapsed? For the sake of our personal interests, we should think more, distinguish right from wrong, and speak reasonably; if we act on temporary impulse and distort the truth, wouldn't we become rumor-mongers who mislead ourselves and others?
　　Rectifying the Party is to eliminate the three evils. Those who help rectify the Party should also avoid the three evils. The three evils are:
　　First, revengeism: For example, in major movements such as "suppressing counter-revolutionaries," it's impossible to be completely free of deviations and errors. Today, during the Party rectification, those who have been wronged naturally want to seek correction of the errors. Good, that's how it should be done. Speak out about the grievances, and I believe the Party will definitely investigate carefully and make corrections. However, those who complain must also recognize that movements such as "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" were necessary to consolidate the revolution and were not just making trouble out of nothing. Without those movements, there would be no "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" today. If we don't see this necessity and adopt the attitude of "you rectified me before, and now I'll rectify you," acting out of spite and seeking revenge, then we will inevitably negate the historical significance of those movements and also abandon the education we received in the movements. If the purpose is revenge, making each other incompatible, it's hard to talk about unity. Whoever's mistake it is, that's whose mistake it is, and whoever's mistake it is should admit it. We cannot push all the mistakes onto Party members just because of Party rectification. We demand fairness from Party members, and we also demand fairness from ourselves. Revengeism can hardly start from fairness, and at most it only increases some individual prestige, but prestige is not as valuable as truth.
　　Second, revisionism: A new country must have a new system. A new system cannot be perfect at once. Good, then we should discuss it in detail and gradually improve it. However, we must pay attention to the fact that all our systems have a common root—the socialist system. The bright future of our entire nation depends on this lifeline. If this root rots, the whole thing withers. Therefore, we should not take advantage of this opportunity to rectify the Party to say without thinking (it would be even worse if we thought about it) that we should abolish the Party's leadership, or transplant the systems of countries like Britain and the United States into our system. Revisionists have no understanding of Marxism-Leninism and have no intention of believing in it. When they have no choice, they pretend to comply and muddle through for a while. When they encounter an opportunity, they will pretend to be clever and come up with wild ideas. Such people are best at revising themselves, and they can believe or not believe in any ideology, changing their course with the wind. As long as there is an opportunity, even if you ask them to join the royalist party, they will recite incantations and kneel to receive the imperial edict. Building socialism can creatively use Marxism-Leninism based on national conditions and public opinion, but it must be Marxism-Leninism, not selling fake plasters to deceive people.
　　Third, opportunism: Opportunists who were shouting "Long live the Communist Party" yesterday, upon seeing the Party asking non-Party members to help rectify the Party, will shout, "The Communist Party can't go on, it's asking us for help!" They will then find half an evidence, crying and saying, "Yes, the Communist Party has messed everything up, the people are living in misery, everyone is crying injustice, let's rise up to save the country! We can't just help rectify the Party, we have to abolish the Party's leadership!" With such a commotion, they feel that their remarks are sharp and to the point, but in fact, they are seeing ghosts in broad daylight, which is chilling. A truly patriotic person would never say such things.
　　Rectifying the Party is a most serious matter. It is indeed shameful to help rectify the Party with the attitude of a petty merchant causing a commotion! If the three evils have not been eliminated, and the three evils come again, two times three equals six, the confusion is doubled, what is the intention?
　　Someone may ask: If this is the case, avoiding the three evils, wouldn't that be inconsistent with "saying everything you know" and "the speaker is not guilty"? The answer is: This is not difficult to explain. "Saying everything you know" requires knowing something first, even if you don't know everything, you still have to know a little bit. If you don't know anything at all and spout nonsense, see if the people of the whole country will agree, the people know how much good the Communist Party has brought, what good things. "The speaker is not guilty" requires telling the truth, being sincere and well-intentioned, loving the Party and the country; if you fabricate rumors and create trouble, and speak nonsense, what's the point of saying it? If you must say it, it's still that sentence, see if the people of the whole country will agree.
　　Eliminate the three harms, eliminate the three evils, Party members and non-Party members, join hands and move forward, towards socialism, what a bright and beautiful scene! Friends, actively help rectify the Party, the Party is lovable, the motherland is lovable, socialism is lovable, but don't get the wrong idea and put yourself behind socialism, becoming the least lovable person!

    事实证明，中国共产党是最真诚的党。要不然，它怎么肯叫党外的人来帮助整党呢？假若它要“党天下”的话，它难道就那么天真，叫别人来帮助整党？或者也不会这么急于整党吧？
    朋友们，党既如此真诚，我们能够辜负党的委托与信任吗？党对我们真诚，我们也要对党真诚，凭着良心有话即说，有意见就提出来。这样彼此以诚相见，推心置腹，党就会更英明地领导我们，我们也就会更幸福。党好，我们好；党垮台，我们垮台，谁也逃不了！
    党员有一千多万，不可能十个手指头一边儿齐，其中有顶好的，也有不大好的，甚至还有少数不正派的。因此，党需要整风，也需要大家帮助。可是，我们不能因为一个或几个党员的坏处便断定党也是坏的。“一马杓坏一锅”这句俗语在这里可用不上。党有党的纪律，向来不许一马杓坏一锅，否则恐怕党早已腐化，不会有今天的威信与功绩。
    党员也是人，这件事办对了，那件事也许办错；要不怎么需要整风呢。我们应当指出他们的错误，这是我们帮助整党的责任。可是，我们不能因为他们的错误而也否定他们的好处，那不公道；我们更不应因为一个党员的错误，不管怎么严重，而也否定了全党。
    既是要和风细雨地整党，我们帮助整党的就也该平心静气，说实话，认真批评，多提建设性的意见。反之，若是抓住机会，不分黑白，否定一切，那就不是帮助整党，而且有意拆党了。党是中国人民的救星，过去如此，现在如此，将来也没人会忘掉，直到永远。这样的党是打不倒，拆不散的。况且，党若垮了，对我们有什么好处呢？为了个人的利益，咱们也应当多想一想，明辨是非，据理发言；若是逞一时的意气，颠倒黑白，岂不落个谣言惑众，自误误人么？
    整党是为除三害。帮助整党的似乎也要避三邪。三邪者：
    一、报复主义：比如说，在“肃反”等大运动中，不可能毫无偏差与错误；今天，在整党之际，受过委屈的自然想要求纠正错误。好，应当这么办。把委屈说出来，我相信党必会去详慎调查，进行纠正。但是，诉苦者也必须认清，为巩固革命，“肃反”等运动是必要的，并不是无事生非。没有那些运动，就不会有今天的百花齐放与百家争鸣。假若不看这个必要，而采取以前你整了我，今天我也整你的态度，从意气出发，施行报复，那就难免否定那些运动的历史意义，而且把自己在运动中所受到的教育也抛弃了。目的在于报复，使彼此不相能，很难说怎么团结了。谁的错误就是谁的错误，谁的错误谁当承认，不能因为整党便把错误全推给党员。我们要求党员要公平，我们也要求自己要公平。报复主义很难从公平出发，至多不过长了个人一些威风，而威风并不像真理那样可贵。
    二、修正主义：新国家必有新制度。新制度一时不能十全十美。好，那就该详细商量，逐步改善。可是，必须注意，我们的一切制度都有个总根——社会主义制度。我们全民族的光明前途全仗着有此命根子，此根一烂，全体枯萎。因此，我们不该乘此整党时机，不加思索（思索了就更糟），就说什么取消党的领导，或把英、美等国的制度挽到我们的制度里边来。修正主义者对马列主义既无了解，也就无心信服。在不得已的时候，阳奉阴违，暂且敷衍一场。遇到机会，他便要假充高明，胡出主意了。这样的人最会修正自己，对什么主义都可信可不信，见风转舵。只要有机可乘，叫他加入保皇党，他也会念念有词，跪接圣旨。建设社会主义可以根据国情民意，创造地运用马列主义，但必须是马列主义，而不是卖假膏药骗人。
    三、机会主义：机会主义者昨天还高呼共产党万岁，今天看见党叫党外人士帮助整党，便大叫一声：“共产党干不下去了，向我们求救了！”紧跟着便找出一半个证据，痛哭流涕地说：“是呀，共产党全搞错了，民不聊生，个个呼冤，大家起来救国呀！不能只帮助整党啊，得取消党的领导！”这么一哄，自己觉得发言尖锐，正切时弊，事实上是白天见鬼，令人齿冷。真正爱国的人一定不会这么说话。
    整党是最严肃的事。若用市侩起哄的态度来帮助整党，的确可耻！三害未除，又来了三邪，二三得六，混乱倍加，是何居心？
    或问：如此说来，宜避三邪，岂不与知无不言，言者无罪，有所不合？答曰：这不难解释。知无不言，必须先知，即使知道的不全面，也总得略知一二。若是全无所知，血口喷人，看看全国老百姓答应不答应，老百姓知道共产党给带来多少好处，什么好处。言者无罪，须是实话，心诚意善，爱党爱国；若是造谣生事，呓语颠倒，说它作甚？假若一定要说，还是那句话，看看全国老百姓答应不答应。
    肃清三害，肃清三邪，党内党外，携手前进，向社会主义前进，这是多么光明美丽的景象啊！朋友们，积极地帮助整党吧，党可爱，祖国可爱，社会主义可爱，可就是别打错了念头，把自己落在社会主义的后边，成为最不可爱的人哪！
