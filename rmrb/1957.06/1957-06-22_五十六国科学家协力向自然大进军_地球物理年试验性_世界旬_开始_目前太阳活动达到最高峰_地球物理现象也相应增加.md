Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Scientists from Fifty-Six Countries Join Forces in a Great March Towards Nature.
    Geophysical Year's Experimental "World Decade" Begins
    Current Solar Activity Reaches its Peak; Geophysical Phenomena Increase Accordingly

    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st. The first "World Decade" (an experimental period for world meteorological observation) of the International Geophysical Year began on June 20th. This is the prelude to the great march of scientists from various countries towards nature - a broad experimental activity in meteorological aspects during the International Geophysical Year's experimental month (June). Thousands of scientific stations around the world will strengthen observations during these ten days, test instrument performance, and prepare to better commence the unprecedented work of this International Geophysical Year.
    In a few days (July 1st), the International Geophysical Year will officially begin. To date, fifty-six countries, including China, have participated in this extremely important event in world scientific history. From this time until the end of December next year, for eighteen months, approximately five thousand scientists worldwide will jointly conduct the most extensive research on the Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere. The scale far exceeds the two International Polar Years held by the international scientific community in the past seventy-five years.
    This International Geophysical Year coincides with the period when solar activity reaches its peak, and many geophysical phenomena increase accordingly. In early June, the sun had another major eruption. On June 4th, the International Geophysical Year traffic network center south of Washington, D.C., in the United States, issued the first instruction of the "Experimental Month" to regional centers in the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and other countries, requesting scientific stations in various countries to strengthen observations on the observation items of the Geophysical Year. The instructions quickly reached various scientific stations. This Geophysical Year has more than two thousand scientific stations, distributed in the Antarctic, Arctic, equator, from 70 to 80 degrees west longitude, and 10 degrees east longitude and 140 degrees east longitude. To collect valuable scientific data, three world data centers have also been established, one in the Soviet Union, one in the United States, and another set up in various locations according to different disciplines.
    The past two Polar Years focused on the Arctic region, and the research projects were limited to meteorology and geomagnetism. This time, not only does the observation area include the entire earth according to the six regions mentioned above, but the research projects have also expanded to fourteen items including meteorology, geomagnetism, seismology, oceanography, glaciology, upper atmosphere ionosphere, aurora, airglow, cosmic rays, solar activity, latitude and longitude determination, gravity measurement, rockets, and artificial satellites.
    To emphasize simultaneous global observation, this International Geophysical Year has stipulated "World Days" and "World Decades." When "World Days" are held, scientific stations in various countries will specially strengthen or increase observations. There are approximately three to four "Regular World Days" each month. "Special World Days" are special observation periods temporarily stipulated when geophysical phenomena that cannot be predicted long-term occur. "World Decades" are periods for strengthening meteorological observations every three months. After this "World Decade" in June, the official "World Decade" will be carried out in September.
    Antarctica is one of the main research objects of the International Geophysical Year. Up to now, eleven countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, have organized Antarctic expeditions. The scientific stations established by the expedition teams of various countries are approaching fifty. Among them, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom are the largest in scale. The Soviet Union is successively establishing three basic scientific stations and some auxiliary observation stations. The United States is also establishing three basic scientific stations and four auxiliary observation stations in Antarctica. The United Kingdom is also preparing to organize an expedition team to complete the 3,200-kilometer journey across the Antarctic continent from the end of this year to the beginning of next year.
    Another feature of this Geophysical Year is the launching of rockets and artificial satellites. Six countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, are participating in the launching of rockets, and the Soviet Union and the United States are preparing to launch a series of artificial satellites. This is still a pioneering work in human history. These artificial satellites will be equipped with various types of instruments and fly hundreds of kilometers into the air to observe various phenomena that could not be observed before.
    Soviet scientists will make significant contributions during the Geophysical Year. Five hundred scientific stations have been established throughout the Soviet Union, accounting for a quarter of the world's total. Soviet scientists also created the world's first non-magnetic ship, the "Zarya". During the International Geophysical Year, it will travel 50,000 nautical miles in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans to conduct geomagnetic surveys.

　　五十六国科学家协力向自然大进军
    地球物理年试验性“世界旬”开始
    目前太阳活动达到最高峰  地球物理现象也相应增加
    新华社21日讯　6月20日，国际地球物理年的第一个“世界旬”（试验性的世界气象观测期间）开始了。这是世界各国科学家向自然大进军的前奏——国际地球物理年试验月（6月）中气象方面的一个广泛试验活动。遍布全世界的数以千计的科学站都要在这十天内加强观测，试验仪器性能，准备更好地开始这次规模空前的国际地球物理年的工作。
    再过几天（7月1日），国际地球物理年就要正式开始了。到目前为止，已经有包括中国在内的五十六个国家参加这个世界科学史上极重大的事件。从这个时候开始，到明年12月底为止的十八个月中，全世界约五千个科学家将联合对地球的气圈、陆圈、水圈进行一次最广泛的研究。阵容大大超过了过去七十五年中国际科学界举行的两次国际极年。
    这届国际地球物理年正当太阳活动达到最高峰的时期，许多地球物理现象也相应增加。6月初，太阳又发生了一次大爆发。6月4日，美国华盛顿以南的国际地球物理年交通网中心向苏联、荷兰、日本、澳大利亚等区域中心发出“实验月”中的第一个指示，要求各国科学站对地球物理年的观测项目加强观察，指示很快就传到各个科学站了。这届地球物理年有二千多个科学站，分布在南极、北极、赤道、西经七十度到八十度，东经十度、东经一百四十度的地区。为了收集珍贵的科学资料，还设立了三个世界资料中心，一个在苏联，一个在美国，另一个按不同学科分设在各地。
    过去两次极年都偏重在北极地区，研究项目也只限于气象和地磁。这次不仅观测地区按上述六个地区包括了整个地球，而且研究项目扩大到气象学、地磁学、地震学、海洋学、冰川学、高空电离层、极光、气辉、宇宙线、太阳活动、经纬度测定、重力测定、火箭和人造卫星等十四项。
    为了着重全球同时观测，这次国际地球物理年规定了“世界日”和“世界旬”。在举行“世界日”的时候，各国科学站便特别加强或增加观测。“正规世界日”每月约有三次到四次。“特殊世界日”是当不能长期预测的地球物理现象发生的时候，临时规定的特殊观测时期。“世界旬”是每隔三个月加强气象观测的时间。6月间这次“世界旬”之后，正式的“世界旬”将在9月进行。
    南极是国际地球物理年的主要研究对象之一。到现在为止，已经有苏联、美国、英国、澳大利亚等十一个国家组织了南极考察队。各国考察队建立的科学站已经将近五十个。其中以苏联、美国和英国的规模最大。苏联正在陆续建立三个基本科学站和一些辅助观察站。美国也正在南极建立三个基本科学站和四个辅助观察站。英国还准备组织一个考察队在今年年底到明年年初，完成横越南极大陆的三千二百公里的旅程。
    这届地球物理年的另一个特点是要放射火箭和人造卫星。参加放射火箭的有苏联、美国、英国、日本等六个国家，苏联和美国都准备放射一系列人造卫星。这在人类历史上还是创举。这些人造卫星将装着各种类型的仪器，飞上几百公里的高空，来观测以前不能观测的各种现象。
    苏联科学家在地球物理年期间，将作出巨大的贡献。全苏联设立了五百个科学站，占全世界总数的四分之一。苏联科学家还创制了世界上第一艘非磁性轮船“曙光号”。在国际地球物理年期间，它将在大西洋、印度洋和太平洋作五万浬的航程，来进行地磁探测。
