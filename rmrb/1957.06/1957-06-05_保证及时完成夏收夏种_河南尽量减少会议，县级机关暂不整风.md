(Our Newspaper) News: In order to ensure the timely completion of summer harvesting, summer planting and other tasks, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed this at an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee on May 29th and decided: During the summer harvest and planting period, minimize all meetings that can be postponed, stop those that should be stopped, and postpone those that should be postponed; county-level organs will temporarily suspend rectification; during the most intense period of summer harvesting and planting, the prefectural committees may temporarily suspend rectification studies and concentrate all their efforts on leading summer harvesting and planting work; relevant provincial departments in charge of agriculture, water conservancy, and grain, on the premise of not delaying rectification and work, may draw some forces from top to bottom to specifically solve problems in summer harvesting and planting, grasp the central work, and immediately organize a group of cadres, led by responsible comrades, to go to the countryside to help with summer harvesting and planting. In the work of summer harvesting and planting, attention should be paid to strengthening specific leadership, overcoming bureaucracy, and correctly handling contradictions among the people. The Provincial Party Committee has already notified the prefectural and county committees by telephone on the same day to implement these decisions.

    保证及时完成夏收夏种
    河南尽量减少会议，县级机关暂不整风
    本报讯　为保证及时地完成夏收夏种等任务，中共河南省委于5月29日，在省委扩大会议上做了讨论，并决定：在夏收夏种期间，尽量减少可以缓开的一切会议，该停的停，该推迟的推迟；县级机关暂不整风；地委在最紧张的夏收夏种期间，可以暂时停止整风学习，集中全力领导夏收夏种工作；省的有关农业、水利、粮食的部门，要在整风、工作两不悮的前提下，可以自上而下地抽出一些力量，专门解决夏收夏种工作中的问题，掌握中心工作，并有计划地立即组织一批机关干部，由负责同志带领下乡，帮助夏收夏种工作。在夏收夏种工作中，要注意加强具体领导，克服官僚主义，正确处理人民内部矛盾问题。如上决定，省委已于当日用电话通知各地委、县委贯彻执行。
