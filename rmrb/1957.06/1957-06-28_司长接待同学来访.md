　　Division Chief Receives Visiting Students
　　On June 4th, Division Chiefs Hou and Li from the Ministry of Education warmly received eighteen of us students. We were all very happy and satisfied with the two division chiefs' emphasis on handling visits from the people.
　　The students raised many opinions on the establishment of political education majors in our school and the opening of political classes in middle schools. The division chiefs attached great importance to our opinions. Division Chief Li insisted on attending this forum despite being ill and asked us to explain further any opinions he didn't hear clearly or that we didn't express clearly. The entire forum lasted five hours, and the students spoke their minds freely, saying everything they wanted to say. Near the end, Division Chief Hou said, "Among the opinions you have raised, there are many that we have not thought of. Really, we have not thought of them." From this, we can see the sincerity and modesty of the division chiefs. At the same time, we can also realize that doing a good job of receiving visits from the people can reduce bureaucracy in the work of leading cadres. We warmly welcome and support this approach.

　　司长接待同学来访
    6月4日，教育部的侯、李司长亲热地接待了我们十八位同学，我们都很高兴并十分满意两位司长重视人民来访的做法。
    同学们对我校设立政治教育专业和中学开设政治课的问题提出许多意见。司长非常重视我们的意见，李司长带病坚持参加这个座谈会并对没听清或我们没说清的意见，让我们再说说。整个座谈时间长达五小时，同学们畅所欲言的把心里话都说了出来。在快要结束时，侯司长说：“大家提的意见中，有很多是我们没有想到的。真的，我们没有想到。”从这里可看出司长的诚恳谦虚，同时，也可认识到：做好接待人民来访的工作可以使领导工作人员的工作少点官僚主义。我们热烈欢迎并支持这种做法。
