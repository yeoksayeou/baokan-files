    Tails and Other Things
    Xi Tong
    Capitalists have crossed the threshold of socialism, still dragging a tail of fixed interest. This phenomenon of transition is not uncommon. For example, many Communist Party members often say that although they have joined the Party organizationally, they still carry a petty-bourgeois tail ideologically. The way out is to continue to reform, so that one day, the tail can finally be removed.
    However, to get rid of the tail, one must admit that one has a tail. If one does not admit to having a tail, but only covers it with both hands, closing one's eyes tightly and shouting, "I have no tail—I haven't had a tail for a long time!" what help is that?
    A tail cannot be denied by sophistry!＊
    Those who say "fixed interest is not exploitation" can no longer justify themselves, but some people have put forward a new argument: fixed interest is exploitation, but it can only be regarded as exploitation before joint state-private ownership, and it is definitely not an act of exploitation now; the government is only paying now. Thus, the conclusion is naturally: the bourgeoisie has no exploitative behavior now.
    This is really trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. Before joint state-private ownership, capitalists clearly took exploitation income according to the "four horses split the fat"; after joint state-private ownership, they clearly continued to take exploitation income according to the amount of capital, at an annual interest rate of 5%. The accounts are recorded so clearly, how can they be arbitrarily altered or moved? The workers are clearly exploited 5% of their labor results today, how can one say that the workers are not being exploited today?

    尾巴及其他
    希同
    资本家跨进了社会主义门槛，还带着一条定息的尾巴。这种转变中的现象本来不算稀奇。例如许多共产党员就常说，他们虽然在组织上入了党，但是在思想上还带着一条小资产阶级的尾巴。出路——就是继续改造，以便有朝一日，终于去掉尾巴。
    然而想去掉尾巴，就必须承认自己有尾巴。如果不承认自己有尾巴，而只是用双手捂住，紧闭着两眼直嚷：“我没有尾巴——早就没有尾巴了！”这有什么帮助呢？
    尾巴是不能靠诡辩否定得掉的！＊
    说“定息不是剥削”的人，已经无法自圆其说了，然而又有人提出了一种新的说法：定息是剥削，但只能算作合营以前的剥削，绝对不是现在的剥削行为，政府只是在现在付款。这样，结论自然是：资产阶级现在已经没有剥削行为了。
    这真是想一手掩尽天下人耳目了。资本家在合营前明明是按四马分肥拿剥削收入；合营后又明明是按资本的多少，按年息5％在继续拿剥削收入。账本上记得这么的清清楚楚，明明白白，岂是能随意加以涂改、挪动的么？工人在今天的劳动成果中明明被剥削去了5％，岂能说工人在今天没有被剥削么？
