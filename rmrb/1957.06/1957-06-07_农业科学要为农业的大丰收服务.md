The long-term plan for the development of science and technology in our country and the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) have stipulated specific tasks and directions for our agricultural science departments in the next few years to develop agricultural science. To strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture nationwide this year, we must strengthen agricultural scientific research to serve the goal of increasing agricultural production.

After the basic completion of agricultural advanced cooperatives in our country, agricultural production must also undergo a series of technical transformations. At present, many state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in various places have raised a large number of technical issues related to agricultural production, requesting answers from agricultural scientific research institutions. We must meet their requirements. However, this is an arduous task. Agricultural science departments in our country should widely unite agricultural scientists, especially the agricultural science workers in higher education institutions, who account for about 61% of the total agricultural science research staff, and organize these forces into various research projects in a planned way to give full play to their strength. At the same time, we should also strengthen the collaboration and cooperation between agricultural science departments and other relevant scientific departments.

The development of various agricultural science disciplines in our country is unbalanced. Some disciplines have a very weak foundation, and some are almost blank. Not long ago, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences was established. These research projects should be carried out and strengthened under the unified leadership of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, organizing forces from all aspects, distinguishing between priorities, and proceeding in a planned and step-by-step manner. In order to further develop agricultural science in our country, we must correspondingly expand and strengthen agricultural scientific research institutions and strengthen the agricultural science team. At present, agricultural science institutions and agricultural science cadres in our country are still relatively weak, especially lacking senior scientific research personnel. Agricultural science leading departments should, in accordance with current tasks and the long-term plan for agricultural science, and in accordance with the principles of streamlining and saving, and running science diligently and thriftily, establish some new research institutions with emphasis, and strengthen existing research institutions. The increase of agricultural science cadres should rely on agricultural colleges to train them. At the same time, agricultural science research departments should pay attention to giving full play to the role of old experts, taking apprentices, opening training classes, and cultivating new forces; and through research practice, gradually improve the theoretical and technical level of agricultural science cadres in service.

In recent years, agricultural scientific research in our country has made great progress. There are already 205 agricultural science experiment and research institutions nationwide, 27 higher agricultural colleges, and more than 11,000 agricultural science researchers and teaching staff above the rank of teaching assistant in higher agricultural colleges. A national agricultural scientific research network has been initially formed. Agricultural scientific work has also made many achievements in inventions, creations, and promotion of advanced agricultural production technologies, which have greatly promoted the cooperation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production in our country. However, the socialist construction cause in our country is developing rapidly, and the development of agricultural production is still not keeping up with the growth rate of industrial production and the urban population. These situations require us to further develop agricultural science, solve new scientific and technological problems that continue to arise in agricultural production, thereby increasing the yield per unit area of agricultural production; and further develop agricultural science theoretical research work so that agricultural science in our country can catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible.

In recent years, agricultural production in our country has continued to grow. On the one hand, it has relied on the superiority of agricultural cooperation and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. The Party and the government, starting from the specific conditions of agricultural production in our country, have put forward specific measures for increasing agricultural production. On the other hand, the broad masses of agricultural scientists in our country, together with rural work cadres, have gone deep into the countryside and into the fields, combined with production increase measures, and carried out scientific and technological research work, thereby improving agricultural production and enriching agricultural science and technology. This practice is worth promoting.

In the future, we must continue to implement the policy of linking theory with practice. This not only requires agricultural scientific work to face production and serve production, but also requires that through serving production, we summarize the experience of production practice, and combine it with carrying out creative research, to continuously enrich and gradually improve the level of agricultural production and scientific theory.

Our agricultural science heritage is very rich. It is not only found in the various academic works of our ancestors, but most of it is also applied in the production practices of our working farmers. Systematically and plannedly sorting out this scientific heritage, and studying and sorting it out with modern scientific theories and technological conditions, is the glorious task of the agricultural science community in our country. This work can not only enrich the treasure house of agricultural science in our country, but also has practical significance for the development of agricultural production in our country. We should especially attach great importance to the creativity of the broad masses of working farmers in production practice, and advocate that the experimental research activities of scientists must be combined with the creativity of the masses. Without the production practice of laborers, science and technology will only be empty. The promotion and application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements requires the creative labor of the broad masses of farmers. Only by relying on working farmers and combining science and technology with the labor of farmers can agricultural scientists achieve twice the result with half the effort in developing agricultural science and developing agricultural production.

At the same time, we should continue to learn from the advanced agricultural science and technology of the Soviet Union and other countries. In the past few years, we have made great achievements in learning from foreign agricultural science and technology, especially the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union that is closely related to production practice. It has enriched, developed, and improved agricultural science and technology in our country. In the future, the tasks of agricultural science and technology work in our country will be quite heavy; and agricultural science in our country is relatively backward. Therefore, actively learning from advanced science and technology from foreign countries (including capitalist countries), especially learning from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, is still a very important task for the agricultural science community in our country.

Our Party and government have always attached importance to agricultural science work, but there are also individual Party and government departments and Party and government workers who believe that agricultural science is "a distant source of water that cannot quench immediate thirst" for agricultural production, and have a mentality of being eager for quick results. Individual administrative leaders also lack a correct attitude towards science, draw conclusions lightly, and even interfere crudely. These are all because they are not familiar with the characteristics of agricultural science work and do not understand the relationship between agricultural science and agricultural production. It should be understood that although natural conditions such as land and labor are the most fundamental conditions for agricultural production, they have certain limitations in developing production, while the development of science is endless. To develop socialist agriculture, especially to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, we must mobilize the existing agricultural science and technology forces in our country to serve the goal of a bumper harvest in agriculture.

### 农业科学要为农业的大丰收服务

    农业科学要为农业的大丰收服务
    我国科学技术发展的远景规划、全国农业发展纲要（草案），给我国农业科学部门规定了今后若干年内发展农业科学的具体任务和方向。而今年为了争取全国农业的大丰收，我们更要加强农业科学研究工作，为实现农业增产的目标而服务。
    我国农业高级合作化基本完成以后，农业生产还必须进行一系列的技术改造。现在有许多地方的国营农场和农业生产合作社提出一大批有关农业生产技术上的问题，要求农业科学研究机关予以解答。我们必须满足他们的要求。但是，这是一个艰巨的任务。我国农业科学部门，应该广泛地团结农业科学家，特别是占整个农业科学研究工作人员61％左右的高等院校的农业科学工作者，有计划地把这些力量组织到各个研究项目中去，充分发挥他们的力量。同时，还应当加强农业科学部门同其它有关科学部门的协作和合作。
    我国农业科学的各个专业，发展是不平衡的。有些专业基础十分薄弱，有些专业几乎还是空白。不久以前，中国农业科学院成立了。这些研究工作，要在农业科学院统一领导下，组织各方面的力量，分别轻重缓急，有计划、有步骤地开展和加强起来。而为了进一步发展我国的农业科学，我们必须相应地扩大和加强农业科学研究机构，壮大农业科学队伍。我国目前农业科学机构和农业科学干部，还是相当薄弱的，特别是缺乏高级科学研究人员。农业科学领导部门，要按照当前任务和农业科学的远景规划，按照精简节约和勤俭办科学的原则，有重点地建立一些新的研究机构，和加强现有的研究机构。农业科学干部的增加一方面要依靠农业院校来培养，同时农业科学研究部门自己更要注意充分发挥老专家的作用，带徒弟，开训练班，培养新生力量；并且通过研究实践，逐步提高在职农业科学干部的理论和技术水平。
    我国农业科学研究事业，近几年来有了很大的发展。全国已有农业科学试验研究机构二百零五个，高等农业院校二十七所，农业科学研究工作人员和高等农业院校助教以上的教学人员一万一千多人。一个全国性的农业科学研究网已经初步形成。农业科学工作在发明创造和推广先进农业生产技术上，也取得了不少成就，对我国农业合作化和农业生产的发展，起了很大的推动作用。但是，我国社会主义建设事业发展很快，而农业生产的发展，还赶不上工业生产和城市人口增长的速度。这些情况要求我们进一步发展农业科学，解决农业生产中不断出现的新的科学技术问题，从而提高农业生产单位面积产量；并进一步发展农业科学理论研究工作，使我国农业科学尽快地赶上世界先进水平。
    几年来我国农业生产不断增长，一方面依靠了农业合作化的优越性和广大农民的生产积极性，党和政府从我国农业生产的具体条件出发，提出了农业增产的具体措施；另方面我国的广大农业科学家，同农村工作干部一起，深入农村、深入田间，结合增产措施，开展科学技术研究工作，从而提高了农业生产，丰富了农业科学技术，这种作法是值得发扬的。
    今后就要继续贯彻理论联系实际这个方针。这不仅要求农业科学工作面向生产，为生产服务，而且要求通过为生产服务，总结生产实践的经验，并结合开展创造性的研究，不断地丰富和逐步地提高农业生产和科学理论的水平。
    我国农业科学遗产是十分丰富的，它不仅见之于我国古人的各类学术著作，而且绝大部分还应用在我国劳动农民的生产实践中。有系统有计划地整理这些科学遗产，用现代的科学理论和技术条件加以研究和整理，是我国农业科学界的光荣任务。这项工作，不仅可以丰富我国农业科学的宝库，而且对发展我国农业生产也是有实际意义的。我们特别应该十分重视广大劳动农民群众在生产实践中的创造性，并提倡科学家的试验研究活动必须与群众的创造性相结合。没有劳动者的生产实践，科学技术只有落空。农业科学技术成果的推广和应用，更需要广大农民创造性的劳动。农业科学家只有依靠劳动农民，把科学技术和农民的劳动结合起来，才能在发展农业科学和发展农业生产上收到事半功倍的效果。
    同时，我们还应该继续学习苏联和其他国家的先进的农业科学技术。过去几年来我们在学习国外农业科学技术方面，特别是学习苏联的和生产实践问题紧密联系的先进科学技术，有着很大的成绩，它丰富、发展和提高了我国农业科学技术。今后我国农业科学技术工作的任务相当繁重；而我国农业科学又比较落后，因此，积极学习国外（包括资本主义国家在内）先进科学技术，特别是学习苏联的先进科学技术仍是我国农业科学界很重要的任务。
    我们的党和政府一向是重视农业科学工作的，但也有个别党政部门和党政工作人员，认为农业科学对农业生产是“远水不解近渴”，有急于求成的思想。个别行政领导人员，还缺乏对待科学的正确态度，轻下结论，甚至粗暴干涉。这些都是因为他们不熟悉农业科学工作的特点，不懂得农业科学和农业生产的关系所致。应该了解，土地和劳动力这些自然条件，虽是农业生产最根本的条件，但它在发展生产上是有一定限制的，而科学的发展则是无止境的。我们要发展社会主义的农业，特别是要努力争取农业的大丰收，就必须动员我国现有的农业科学技术力量，为农业的大丰收而服务。
