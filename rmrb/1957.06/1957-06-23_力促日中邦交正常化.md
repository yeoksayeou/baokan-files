　　Striving to Promote the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations
　　Chairman of the Japan-China Export-Import Association, Nanxiang Sanlang
　　China and Japan are nations of the same script and race. Although there have been twists and turns in the relationship between the two countries, they were short-lived, while the history of maintaining friendly relations is very long. In the future, our two countries should be forever friendly and good neighbors. Although the political systems and ideologies of the two countries are different, as the leaders of New China have repeatedly stated, mutual respect for each other's national spirit is the foundation for friendly coexistence between the two countries.
　　China is a large country with abundant natural resources. In the past, apart from agricultural products, there was nothing worthy of praise. But now China is implementing its first Five-Year Plan, and there are also second and third Five-Year Plans. Once China's abundant resources are combined with modern science, I believe that China's economic strength will soon be able to rival that of European and American countries.
　　Japan has a narrow land area, a large population, and a lack of resources. Therefore, in order to develop its economy, it must rely on overseas trade, especially importing various necessary raw materials from its neighbor China. On the other hand, it must also export various industrial products, construction materials, and so on to China. By exchanging what each needs and expanding trade in mutually required materials, it will be beneficial to both countries' prosperity and development.
　　China and Japan also have a long history of cultural exchange. With such a close relationship between the two countries, it is very regrettable that the two countries have not yet restored diplomatic relations or concluded a treaty of commerce and navigation, regardless of the international situation. I am convinced that further development of trade between the two countries will be the most powerful means of paving the way for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

　　力促日中邦交正常化
　　日中输出入协会理事长  南乡三郎
    日中两国是同文同种的民族，两国间虽然有过波折，但时间很短，而保持着友好关系的历史却是很长的。将来我们两国应是永远亲善友好的近邻。两国的政治制度和思想意识固然不同，但正如新中国领袖们屡次表明的那样，互相尊重彼此的立国精神乃是两国友好相处的基础。
    中国是一个大国，有丰富的自然资源。过去除农产品以外却没有什么可以称道的东西。但是现在中国实行第一个五年计划，并且还有第二、第三个五年计划。中国的丰富资源一旦和近代科学结合起来，我相信，中国的经济实力在不久将来将可与欧美各国并驾齐驱。
    日本土地狭窄，人口众多，缺乏资源。因此，为了发展经济，必须依靠海外贸易，特别是要从近邻中国输入必需的各种原料，另一方面还必须向中国输出各种工业产品、建设资材等等。有无相通，扩大彼此所需要的物资的贸易，这对两国的繁荣和发展都是有利的。
    日中两国的文化交流，也有悠久的历史。两国间有着这样唇齿相依的关系，不管基于什么样的国际形势，至今两国间还没有恢复邦交，也没有缔结通商航海条约，这是非常遗憾的。我确信，两国间进一步发展贸易，将是铺平日中两国恢复邦交的道路的最有力的手段。（附图片）
