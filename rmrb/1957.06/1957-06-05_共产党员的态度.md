    The Attitude of a Communist Party Member
    Reported: Beijing Agricultural University specifically addressed problems in the rectification campaign. Many higher-level Party members requested demotion; some Party members proposed to give up the extra housing they occupied. This is a new phenomenon emerging from the rectification campaign.
    It is called a new phenomenon in comparison to the old "phenomenon." Only in comparison can we know the value of the new phenomenon. Let's look at the situation last year. In the evaluation of grades, some people fought for higher grades and better treatment. When they didn't get it, they became emotional and worked passively, saying they wanted to be paid "according to their work." Some people proposed during democratic appraisal that they should be promoted by three or two grades, or at least one grade. When the appraisal result was only one grade higher, or even remained the same, the resistance in their minds was imaginable. In the minds of these people, it could be said that "life is precious, but grade is more valuable."
    But now there are some people who think that their grades are too high. In terms of their work ability and contribution to the revolution, it is not commensurate. Therefore, they automatically request to lower their grades. Isn't this the attitude that a Communist Party member should have? Tian Ma

    共产党员的态度
    报载：北京农业大学具体解决整风中的问题，许多级别偏高的党员要求降级；有的党员提出要把自己多住的房子让出来。这是整风中出现的新气象。
    说它是新气象，是和旧的“气象”相比。相比之下，才知新气象之可贵。看一看去年的情况吧，在评级中，有一些人争级别，争待遇，没有达到，便闹情绪，消极怠工，说什么要“按酬取劳”云云。有的人在民主评议时提出，自己应该升三级或两级，最少也得升上一级，而当评议结果只升了一级、甚至原级不动时，他们思想上的抵触就可想而知了。在这些人的心目中，真可算是“生命诚可贵，级别价更高”了。
    而现在竟出现了这样一些人，他们认为自己的级别偏高了，按自己的工作能力和对革命的贡献来说，不太相称，因而自动地要求降低级别。这不正是共产党员应该有的态度么？　天马
