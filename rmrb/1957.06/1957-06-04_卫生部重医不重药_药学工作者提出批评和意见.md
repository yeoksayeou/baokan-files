Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association held symposiums on May 17th, 22nd, and 29th, where more than thirty pharmaceutical workers freely discussed problems in pharmaceutical work. Li Dequan, Minister of Health, and Vice Ministers Xu Yunbei and Cui Yitian all attended the symposiums.

At the symposiums, many people criticized the Ministry of Health's leadership ideology of emphasizing medicine over pharmacy, and raised many criticisms and opinions regarding problems in pharmaceutical administration, pharmaceutical education, pharmacy work, drug testing, and pharmaceutical research.

Xie Chongzhang of the Ministry of Health's Drug Testing Institute believes that the Ministry of Health has not done a good job in recent years due to its unfamiliarity with the business and insufficient adoption of expert opinions. He said that within the Ministry of Health, there are no people who understand medicine to lead pharmaceutical administration work, and there are practically no pharmaceutical cadres with more than seven years of work experience. The Ministry of Health's 1956-1957 health work plan does not specifically mention, or does not mention at all, the development of pharmaceutical administration work, pharmaceutical research, pharmacy work, and the training of pharmaceutical talents. He said that many things that should have been done have not been done. For example, which drugs are encouraged to be used, which are eliminated; what varieties are produced, what varieties are imported, the Ministry of Health has not inquired or has not planned. Xie Chongzhang also said that there is only one regulation on the management of narcotic drugs in pharmaceutical administration work, and there are no other management regulations, resulting in each region having its own management regulations, some strict and some loose, causing difficulties in the work. Xue Yu, Director of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Chairman of the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College, said that some people say that the Pharmaceutical Administration Department is the weakest link in the Ministry of Health, and to change the idea of neglecting pharmacy, it is necessary to strengthen pharmaceutical administration work first.

Chen Xinqian of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association said that the Ministry of Health's neglect of pharmacy is also manifested in its lack of attention to the Pharmaceutical Association. Fu Lianzhang, Vice Minister of Health, is the Honorary Chairman of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, he often goes to the Chinese Medical Association, but does not come to the Pharmaceutical Association. The Ministry of Health did not notify the Pharmaceutical Association when holding symposiums related to medicine.

Professors from the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College raised many opinions on pharmaceutical education at the symposium. Lin Qishou said that the pharmaceutical education system is constantly changing, the teaching plan cannot be well confirmed, and he feels that pharmaceutical education has no direction. The reason why pharmaceutical education has not achieved much in recent years is that the Ministry of Health and the medical colleges do not pay enough attention to pharmaceutical education. The leaders of the medical colleges mostly study medicine and consider medical aspects more, while pharmaceutical aspects are not taken care of like illegitimate children. Lou Zhicen believes that the Department of Pharmacy cannot be developed in the medical college. He said that the Ministry of Health once said that the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College would be independently built into a pharmaceutical college, and now the Second Medical College is about to be established, but the Department of Pharmacy has never been independently established, which shows that the Ministry of Health does not pay enough attention to pharmaceutical education. Lin Qishou said that a Soviet expert once compared medicine and pharmacy to two legs of a person, which should be developed in a balanced way, otherwise it would be a cripple. He hopes that the Ministry of Health will pay attention to pharmaceutical education and correctly understand the problems existing in pharmaceutical education.

Yao Linfu, a fourth-year student representative of the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College, said that they believe that it is wrong to only set up a general pharmacy major. Many courses that should be learned have not been learned, so the foundation is poor and the quality is low. They request to be divided into subjects for remedial classes to train them into the people most needed by the country. Zheng Yihua and Wu Zhenjie, representatives of graduates from the pharmaceutical training course of Beijing Medical College, also requested the Ministry of Health to fulfill its promise and give some of their classmates the opportunity to further improve their skills.

Chen Lanying, Director of the Pharmacy Department of China Union Medical College, and You Daixiang, a pharmacist at Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, both talked about problems in pharmacy work. They said that due to insufficient leadership attention, pharmacy work lacks a system. Chen Lanying said that the situation where pharmaceutical workers are not valued in hospitals is very serious and also a common problem. Hospital leaders believe that pharmaceutical workers only "wrap packages," and only require pharmaceutical workers to dispense medicines quickly, but do not pay enough attention to the learning and further education of pharmaceutical workers. She and You Daixiang suggested that the Ministry of Health inspect the idea of neglecting pharmacy from top to bottom and change the current state of no leadership in pharmacy work.

Zhou Mengbai of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine said that the pharmacopoeia is the standard for drug testing, but the current pharmacopoeia can only be used as a reference, and has not yet become a formal code, so that drug production fluctuates, without a certain standard.

Several pharmaceutical workers talked about problems in drug testing institutes. Xu Yujun of the Ministry of Health's Drug Testing Institute said that the Ministry of Health's idea of setting up too many establishments is very problematic. He believes that drug testing institutes have developed rapidly in recent years, and there are currently 26 in the country, but the quality is very poor, and most are recent graduates from the Department of Pharmacy. It is very difficult to work, and many problems cannot be solved. Xie Chongzhang also mentioned that because of insufficient tasks, many local drug testing institutes have carried out research work, inevitably overlapping and wasting manpower and material resources. He said that drug testing work is a part of pharmaceutical administration work, and the Ministry of Health wants to replace pharmaceutical administration work with drug testing work, but pharmaceutical administration work cannot be done well. He believes that it is wrong for the Ministry of Health to measure the development of pharmaceutical administration work by the development of drug testing institutes.

Several pharmaceutical workers talked about the research of traditional Chinese medicine. Zhou Mengbai believes that the Ministry of Health does not pay enough attention to traditional Chinese medicine, and the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is just a desk and chair institute. Ran Xiaofeng of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine said that the current research on traditional Chinese medicine is in an organizational and methodological state of an ivory tower that cannot reach the sky or the earth. The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica is a typical example. He believes that the research on traditional Chinese medicine should first be sorted out on the original basis, and then focus on research on the basis of sorting out. The direction of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica should be to retain what should be retained and coordinate what should be coordinated.

Zhang Bingxin of Tongrentang said that the technology of traditional Chinese medicine is getting worse and worse, crudely made and shoddy, and falsely imitating, which is a great distance from the people's health cause, which is related to the leadership's lack of attention.

Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, spoke at the end of the last symposium. He said that the symposiums of the past few days have put forward many valuable opinions, which are very helpful to the Ministry of Health. He said that in the future, the Ministry of Health will solve and improve problems realistically in the spirit of rectification and in combination with the current practical work. He said that the Ministry of Health has the confidence to closely contact and unite with pharmaceutical workers to solve problems.

    卫生部重医不重药
    药学工作者提出批评和意见
    本报特约新华社稿　中国药学会总会在5月17、22、29日召开座谈会，三十多位药学工作者畅谈了药学工作中的问题。卫生部部长李德全，副部长徐运北、崔义田都出席了座谈会。
    在座谈会上，许多人批评了卫生部重医不重药的领导思想，并就药政工作、药学教育、药房工作、药品检验、药学研究等方面存在的问题提出许多批评和意见。
    卫生部药品检验所解崇璋认为几年来由于卫生部业务不熟悉，工作没作好，而吸取专家的意见也不够。他说，卫生部里，没有懂药的人作药政领导工作，具有七年以上工作经验的药学干部可以说没有。卫生部制订的1956年—1957年卫生工作规划中对药政工作、药学研究、药房工作的发展以及药学人材的培养等都提得不具体或只字未提。他说，很多应作的工作没有作。例如，哪些药品是提倡使用的，哪些是淘汰的；生产哪些品种，进口哪些品种，卫生部都没有过问或没有计划。解崇璋还说，药政工作中只有一个麻醉药管理条例，其他的管理条例就没有，结果各地有各自的管理条例，这地方严，那地方松，造成工作中的困难。中国药学会总会理事长、北京医学院药学系主任薛愚说，有人说药政司是卫生部中最薄弱的一环，要改变轻药的思想首先要加强药政工作。
    中国药学会总会陈新谦说，卫生部轻药也表现在对药学会不重视。卫生部副部长傅连暲是中国药学会总会的名誉理事长，他经常到中华医学会去，但不到药学会来。卫生部召开同药有关的座谈会，也没有通知药学会。
    北京医学院药学系的教授们在座谈会上对药学教育提出了许多意见。林启寿说，药学教育的制度时常改变，教学计划不能很好肯定，感到药学教育无方向。几年来药学教育收获不大的原因是，卫生部和医学院对药学教育关心不够。医学院的领导多是学医的，考虑医学方面多些，药学方面像私生子一样得不到照顾。楼之岑认为药学系在医学院中得不到发展。他说过去卫生部曾说将北京医学院药学系独立建成药学院，现在第二医学院又将建立，而药学系始终未独立建院，这说明卫生部对药学教育重视不够。林启寿说，一位苏联专家曾把医、药比作人的两条腿，应平衡发展，否则是跛子。他希望卫生部重视药学教育，正确了解药学教育中存在的问题。
    北京医学院药学系四年级学生代表姚林富说，他们认为目前只设立一般药学专业是错误的，许多该学的课未学，因而基础差、质量低，他们要求分科进行补课，把他们培养成国家最需要的人。北京医学院药学专修科毕业生代表郑奕化、吴振杰也要求卫生部实现自己的诺言，给他（她）们一批同学以进修提高的机会。
    中国协和医学院药房主任陈兰英和北京中苏友谊医院药师游代祥都谈到药房工作中的问题。他们说，由于领导重视不够，药房工作缺乏制度。陈兰英说，药工人员在医院中不被重视的情况很严重也是普遍存在的问题。医院领导认为药工人员只是“包包”的，对药工人员只要求发药快，但对药工人员的学习、进修等问题却不够关心，她和游代祥建议卫生部从上到下检查轻药思想，改变目前药房工作无人领导的状态。
    中医研究院中药研究所周梦白说，药典是药品检验的标准，但现在的药典只能供参考，到现在还没有成为正式法典，以至在药品生产中忽高忽低，没有一定标准。
    有几位药学工作者谈到药品检验所方面的问题。卫生部药品检验所徐玉均说，卫生部的铺摊子思想很有问题。他认为几年来药品检验所发展很快，目前，全国已达二十六处，但质量很差，大部是药学系刚毕业的。工作起来很吃力，许多问题解决不了。解崇璋也提到各地药品检验所由于任务不足，许多所开展研究工作，不免重复，浪费了人力物力。他说，药品检验工作是药政工作的一部分，卫生部想用药品检验工作代替药政工作，药政工作是不能作好的。他认为卫生部以药品检验所的发展来衡量药政工作的发展是不对的。
    有几位药学工作者谈到关于中药的研究问题。周梦白认为目前卫生部对中药不够重视，中医研究院的中药研究所只是桌子板凳的研究所。中医研究院中药研究所冉小峰说目前的中药研究在组织上、方法上是上不了天、下不了地的空中楼阁状态，中药研究所就是这样的典型，他认为中药研究首先应在原有的基础上整理，在整理的基础上重点地研究。中药研究所的方向是应保留的保留，应协调的协调。
    同仁堂张炳鑫说中药技术一代不如一代，粗制滥造，以假乱真，与人民健康事业有很大距离，这与领导不重视有关。
    卫生部副部长徐运北在最后一次座谈会结束时讲了话。他说几天的座谈会提出了许多宝贵意见，对卫生部很有帮助。他说，卫生部今后要以整风的精神，结合当前的实际工作，实事求是地来解决和改进。他说，卫生部有信心和药学工作者密切联系，团结在一起解决问题。
