Xinhua News Agency, London, 21st. In an attempt to escape the accusations of people from all countries, the US representative to the disarmament talks, Stassen, began on the 20th to issue the first of his so-called series of important statements indicating the US attitude and putting forward new US disarmament proposals.

Stassen said at the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting that the United States believes that any first-step disarmament agreement must include provisions on troop levels and nuclear testing.

He said that the United States is prepared to agree to a provision to reduce the armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union to 2.5 million troops each without any political preconditions. The reduction should take place within one year of the signing of the treaty.

He also said that the United States, hoping to meet the Soviet Union halfway, is prepared to consider further reductions, reducing armed forces to a number significantly lower than 2.5 million, which may be done in two further steps, depending on whether "political issues are resolved." However, he indicated that in this regard, the United States would not reduce troops to 1.5 million as the Soviet Union has demanded.

Stassen's speech did not mention what the maximum limit of armed forces for Britain, France, and China would be according to the US proposal.

On the issue of nuclear testing, Stassen said that the United States is unwilling to stop nuclear testing as the Soviet Union has demanded unless progress is made simultaneously in other areas of disarmament. He said that an agreement stipulating appropriate provisions for nuclear testing should be linked to an agreement on armed forces levels and form part of a first-step disarmament agreement.

Stassen said that if an agreement is reached on the first step, the United States is willing to establish a committee of experts to draft the details. He will present the US disarmament proposals in other areas point by point later.

Stassen's above-mentioned proposal was put forward as part of the overall US proposal, and solely as the US proposal, which shows that he has not yet been able to work out a comprehensive disarmament plan with other Western countries. However, because he could no longer wait to escape the world's accusations against Western countries for obstructing disarmament, he put forward such a proposal.

The representatives of Britain, France, and Canada at the meeting supported Stassen's speech and expressed their willingness to reduce armed forces on the basis of relative troop levels. However, the representatives of Britain and France emphasized that it is more important to reduce weapons than to reduce armed forces at present.

The Soviet representative Zorin asked Stassen to clarify the US plan. Stassen said that he would provide more details of the US plan at a later meeting.

The next meeting of the Subcommittee will be held on the 25th.

　　想逃开各国人民的指责
    史塔生端出一个裁军建议
    同意苏美裁军到二百五十万  但不愿立即停止核武器试验
    新华社伦敦21日电　美国参加裁军谈判的代表史塔生20日开始发表他所谓的一系列表明美国态度和提出美国裁军新建议的重要声明中的第一个声明。
    史塔生在裁军小组委员会会议上说，美国认为，任何第一步裁军协定必须包括关于军队水平和原子核试验的条款。
    他说，美国准备不附加任何政治先决条件而同意把美国和苏联的武装部队各裁减到二百五十万人的规定。裁减应该在签订条约后一年内进行。
    他又说，美国因为希望走一半路同苏联妥协，准备考虑进一步的裁减，把武装部队裁减到大大低于二百五十万人的数字，这可能要再分两步做，看“政治问题是否解决”而定。但是他表明，在这方面，美国不会像苏联要求的那样把部队裁减到一百五十万人的数字。
    史塔生的发言没有谈到，根据美国的建议，英国、法国和中国的武装部队最高限额将是多少。
    谈到原子核试验问题，史塔生说，美国不愿意像苏联要求的那样停止核试验，除非在裁军的其他方面同时取得进展。他说，就原子核试验规定适当条款的协议应该同武装部队水平的协议联系起来，并且构成第一步裁军协议的一部分。
    史塔生说，如果就第一步达成协议，美国愿意成立一个专家委员会来拟订细节。关于美国在其他方面的裁军建议，他以后将逐点提出。
    史塔生的上述建议是作为美国整个建议的一部分提出的，而且是单单作为美国的建议提出的，这说明他还没有能够同其他西方国家一起拟订出一项全盘的裁军计划。但是由于他不能够再等候下去，以求逃开全世界对西方国家阻挠裁军的指责，所以他才提出这样的建议。
    英国、法国和加拿大三国代表在会上支持史塔生的发言，并且表示愿意在相对的军队水平的基础上裁减武装部队。但是英、法两国代表强调，目前裁减武器比裁减武装部队更为重要。
    苏联代表佐林要求史塔生把美国的计划加以澄清。史塔生说，他将在晚些时候的会议上提供美国计划的更多的内容。
    小组委员会下次会议将在25日举行。
