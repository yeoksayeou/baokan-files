Mr. Dong Shiguang, a lecturer at Southwest Normal College, as early as before May 29th, took the lead in Chongqing, acting as an "echo" for some people with ulterior motives in Beijing and Shanghai. It is a pity that we only learned about it today. May I ask, Mr. Dong, what kind of masses are you? Perhaps you fancy yourself as the kind with "conscience and a sense of justice"? But that's just your "self-appointment"! In our view, you should be classified into the first type, because you are qualified to be an "echo." However, you seem to be somewhat more clever, because when you "echo" the reactionary "voices" of certain people in Beijing, it seems you are not "brainless," but rather quite conscious and proactive. As for us, we don't feel any displeasure towards the "nickname" given by Mr. Dong. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao say what we want to say in our hearts and do what we want to do. The Party leads us and educates us, just like our own brain commands our own hands and feet. We are truly willing to echo the voice of the Communist Party, the voice of Chairman Mao, and the voice of socialism.

　　应共产党之声有什么不好？
    西南师范学院的讲师董时光先生，早在5月29日以前，就在重庆身先士卒，充当起北京、上海某些别有用心的人的“应声虫”了，可惜今天我们才得知道。请教董先生，您是哪一种群众呢？大概自封是“有良心有正义感”的那一种吧？但这只能算您“自封”！以我们看，您倒是应该归入第一种，因为您很够个“应声虫”的条件了。不过，您似乎要比较高明些，因为在您“应”北京某些人的反动之“声”的时候，看来并非“没有头脑”，而是相当有些自觉性和主动性哩。至于我们，对董先生所赐的“雅号”，倒没有什么不快，共产党、毛主席说我们心里想说的话，办我们心里想办的事；党领导我们，教育我们，就像我们自己的脑子指挥我们自己的手脚一样，我们应共产党之声，应毛主席之声，应社会主义之声，真是心甘情愿。　　北京市劳动人民文化宫文艺科全体干部
