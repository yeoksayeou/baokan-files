    Listening to Speeches by Provincial and Municipal Party Secretaries

    In the past, it was not easy to see leaders, and it was even more difficult to hear reports from leaders.

    Now it's different. On May 11th and 25th, we heard two speeches by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people. Each of these two speech meetings had four to five thousand attendees. The admission tickets for the speeches were not distributed by the Party Committee or government offices based on rank or political conditions as in the past, but were sold publicly by the lecture hall. The audience included cadres, soldiers, workers, teachers, as well as students, industrialists, businesspeople, residents, and housewives. This is truly a great thing.

    听省、市委书记演讲
    过去，要见首长不容易，要听首长报告就更难了。
    现在就不同了。5月11日和25日，我们就听到了中共湖北省委第一书记王任重和中共武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫的两次演讲，讲的是有关正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。这两次演讲会，听的人都有四、五千。讲演会的入场券，不像过去由党委或机关根据级别或政治条件来分发，而是由讲演馆公开出售。听众中有干部、军人、工人、教师，也有学生、工商界、居民和家庭妇女。这实在是一件大好事。
