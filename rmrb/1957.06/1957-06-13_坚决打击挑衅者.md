　　Resolutely Strike Back at Provocateurs
　　On June 12th, four naval attack planes from the American aircraft carrier "Hornet" intruded into the airspace over the Shantou area of Guangdong Province for harassment. Our anti-aircraft artillery forces immediately launched a fierce bombardment, damaging one of the intruding American planes. This intrusion into our country's airspace by American naval aircraft is yet another serious provocation by the United States against our country. The Chinese people express their utmost indignation at this and lodge a serious protest with the American government!

　　In order to permanently occupy our country's territory of Taiwan and prevent the Chinese people from peacefully liberating Taiwan, the United States has actively supported various military activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique for several years, and has continuously dispatched American military aircraft to intrude into our country's airspace to carry out provocations and demonstrations. This incident of American naval provocation is another blatant manifestation of the United States' consistent hostility towards the Chinese people, and is a planned action by the United States to prevent our people from peacefully liberating Taiwan and to create tension in the Far East.

　　This provocative incident by the United States is not accidental. Not long ago, the anti-American demonstrations in Taiwan and the independent actions taken by Britain on the "embargo" policy had pushed the United States' policy of hostility and aggression against China to the brink of bankruptcy. In this increasingly unfavorable situation, the United States is attempting to plot new conspiracies to create new tensions in Asia in order to continue to maintain its policy of hostility and aggression against China. This provocative incident by the United States is clearly part of the new conspiracy being planned by the United States.

　　Our government has repeatedly declared: The Chinese people will never threaten or invade others, but we will never allow others to threaten or invade us. In order to safeguard the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty, the Chinese people must resolutely strike back at any invaders. The Chinese people not only have the determination to resolutely defend our country's territory, but also possess the full strength to repel the provocations of any aggressors. If the American aggressors dare to invade our country, our glorious armed forces must give them a crushing blow. The American aggressors must never imagine that the Chinese people will make any concessions to them, and must never imagine that they will gain any advantage in People's China.

　　China's territory, airspace, and territorial waters are sacred and inviolable. The American aggressors must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of their provocation.

　　坚决打击挑衅者
    6月12日，美国航空母舰大黄蜂号上的海军攻击机四架，侵入我广东省汕头地区上空进行骚扰。我高射炮部队当即给予猛烈轰击，击伤入侵的美国飞机一架。美国海军飞机这次侵犯我国领空的行为，是美国对我国的又一次严重的挑衅。我国人民对此表示万分愤慨，并向美国政府提出严重的抗议！
    美国为了永远霸占我国领土台湾，和阻止中国人民对台湾的和平解放，几年以来曾积极支持蒋介石集团的各种军事活动，并不断派遣美国的军用飞机侵犯我国的领空，进行挑衅和示威。这次发生的美国海军挑衅事件，是美国一贯敌视中国人民的又一次露骨表现，是美国企图阻止我国人民和平解放台湾并在远东制造紧张局势的有计划的行动。
    美国的这次挑衅事件，并不是偶然的。不久以前在台湾发生的反美大示威，和英国在“禁运”政策上采取的独立行动，已使美国敌视和侵略中国的政策，处于破产的边缘。在这种越来越不妙的形势下，美国正企图策划新的阴谋，在亚洲制造新的紧张局势，以便继续维持它的敌视和侵略中国的政策。美国这次挑衅事件，显然是美国策划中的新阴谋的一部分。
    我国政府曾经一再宣布：中国人民决不威胁和侵犯别人，但是我们也决不容许别人威胁和侵犯。中国人民为了维护国家的领土和主权的完整，对于任何侵犯者必须予以坚决的回击。我国人民不但有坚决保卫我国领土的决心，而且拥有充分的力量击退任何侵略者的挑衅。美国侵略者如果胆敢向我国进犯，我国人民光荣的武装力量一定要给以粉碎的打击。美国侵略者决不要幻想我国人民会对于他们作任何忍让，决不要幻想在人民中国捞到任何便宜。
    中国的领土、领空、领海是神圣不可侵犯的。美国侵略者对于挑衅的一切后果，必须负完全责任。
