Xinhua News Agency, June 20th Dispatch from Moscow: The Presidium of the Soviet Veterans Committee, in an appeal, urged veterans from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas to join Soviet veterans in opposing the preparations for atomic war, and requested them to demand that their governments halt the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　This appeal, adopted on the 19th, stated that the governments of imperialist countries are unwilling to stop the arms race of atomic war. We call on veterans from all countries around the world and the World Veterans Federation to unanimously demand that the governments of major powers reach an agreement to ban the testing of all kinds of nuclear weapons.

　　The appeal also called on the people of all countries around the world to act together to block the road to atomic war.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 20th Dispatch from Helsinki: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference on the evening of the 19th that the first step in disarmament should be to stop experimental explosions.

　　Nehru said that he believed it would be "too optimistic" to expect a "complete solution."

　　He said: "I think a better way is to try to take a step at a certain period, and each step will help to take the next step. The first step should be to stop experimental explosions."

　　He once again criticized military alliances for creating tension and exacerbating fear.

　　The Indian Prime Minister also spoke about India's Five-Year Plan. He said that the Indian people must endure a period of austerity.

　　Commenting on the elections in Kerala, Nehru admitted that the Congress Party had failed. He said that the Congress Party government, which previously held office there, had become very unpopular. He said that the Communists now in power in Kerala are working "very appropriately."

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi Telegram: Kathmandu Message: Nepalese Foreign Minister Chuda Prasad Sharma said on June 16 that he welcomes the progress made at the disarmament conference currently being held in London.

　　Sharma was referring to the formal proposal made by the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Zorin proposed to the Disarmament Subcommittee to temporarily halt nuclear weapons testing for at least two to three years and to establish a number of monitoring stations.

　　Sharma said that the major powers possessing nuclear weapons must find ways and means to reach an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and broad disarmament.

　　Xinhua News Agency: Oslo Message: As of June 15, 210,000 Norwegians have signed a petition calling for a halt to nuclear weapons testing. These include the Mayor of Oslo, members of parliament, and many scientists.

　　The signature campaign was launched a few weeks ago in response to the call by renowned scientist Schweitzer.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 20th Dispatch from TASS, New York, June 19th: According to the Mexican "People's Daily," the Mexican Youth League and the Mexican Student Revolutionary League issued a joint statement condemning the testing of atomic weapons. The statement called on scientists, workers, farmers, and youth across the country to "resolutely strive for a halt to nuclear testing."

　　The "People's Daily" also said that most newspapers and many politicians in Mexico are also resolutely demanding a halt to atomic weapons testing.

　　各国人民要用行动挡住原子战争道路
    呼吁以停止试验作为裁军第一步
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联退伍军人委员会主席团在一份呼吁书中，吁请欧、亚、非、澳和美洲的全体退伍军人同苏联退伍军人一起反对原子战争备战，请他们要求本国政府停止试验原子武器和氢武器。
    这份在19日通过的呼吁书说，帝国主义国家的政府不愿意停止原子战争的军备竞赛。我们号召全世界各国的退伍军人和世界退役军人联合会一致要求大国政府达成禁止试验各种核武器的协议。
    呼吁书还号召全世界各国人民一致行动起来，挡住原子战争的道路。
    据新华社20日讯　赫尔辛基消息：印度总理尼赫鲁19日晚上在记者招待会上说，裁军的第一步应当是停止试验性爆炸。
    尼赫鲁说，他认为，如果指望取得“完整的解决”，那未免“太乐观了”。
    他说：“我认为比较好的办法是在某一时期设法采取一个步骤，每一个步骤都有助于采取下一步骤。第一步应当是停止试验性爆炸。”
    他再次指责军事联盟造成紧张局势，加剧恐惧心理。
    这位印度总理还谈到印度的五年计划。他说，印度人民必须经受一个节约时期。
    在评论喀拉拉邦的选举时，尼赫鲁承认国大党失败了。他说，以前在那里行使职权的国大党政府已经变得非常不得人心。他说，现在在喀拉拉邦执政的共产党人“非常适当地”进行工作。
    新华社新德里电　加德满都消息：尼泊尔外交大臣丘达·普拉萨德·夏尔马6月16日说，他欢迎目前正在伦敦举行的裁军会议所取得的进展。
    夏尔马是指苏联正式提出的建议而言的。苏联代表佐林在裁军小组委员会上提出，至少在两三年内暂时停止原子核武器试验，并且建立若干监督站。
    夏尔马说，拥有原子核武器的大国必须就禁止原子核武器和广泛裁军问题找到达成协议的方法和道路。
    新华社讯　奥斯陆消息：到6月15日为止，已经有二十一万挪威人在要求停止核武器试验的呼吁书上签了名。其中包括奥斯陆市市长、议员和许多科学家。
    签名运动是响应名科学家施维泽尔的号召而在几星期前发起的。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：据墨西哥“人民报”报道，墨西哥青年联盟和墨西哥学生革命联盟发表了一个联合声明，谴责试验原子武器。声明号召全国科学家、工人、农民和青年“坚决争取停止原子核试验”。
