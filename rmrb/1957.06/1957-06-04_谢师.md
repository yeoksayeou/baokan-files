Thanking the Teacher
Qin Zheng

The graduation exhibition of the oil painting training class has already opened in the capital. This is the result of our nineteen young art workers' hard work and study under the two years of painstaking guidance of the famous Soviet painter, two-time Stalin Prize winner, Professor Konstantin M. Maksimov. The more than one hundred exhibited works are just a tender seedling that has just broken ground, but in every moment of its growth is condensed the hard work and shared joys and sorrows of teachers and students. A year ago, when we started working on our graduation creations, everyone felt a little apprehensive, knowing that our foundation in oil painting techniques was shallow, and that completing a relatively complete creation in such a short period of time was really not something we were sure of. Professor Maksimov, however, encouraged us with confidence: "Look, the Moscow Surikov Art Institute is a six-year program, but you only study for two years. However, I fully believe in the talent and creativity of Chinese youth. Besides, you all have a certain amount of struggle and life experience, don't you have something you urgently need to express? Don't be afraid, courage plus wisdom can create miracles!"

Soon, we all sketched out drafts based on our own intentions and materials. After the teacher looked at them, he correctly pointed out that some were simply narrating the event process or treating the subject matter in an illustrative way. He said: "Painting is different from literature, drama, or film. It cannot continuously present all the details of life. The picture can only show fragments of life events, so that people can understand what its past and future will be like. For example, Repin's painting "Ivan the Terrible and His Son" does not mainly depict how the tyrant Ivan killed his son, but more importantly reveals the emergence of new humanity. At the moment when the cruel father killed his own son in a rage, the long-lost humanity and conscience suddenly revived. He pressed the fatal wound on the prince's head tightly with his convulsive hands, and thick blood gushed out from between his fingers, all showing that everything was forever irreparable... When you deal with your own subjects, you should pay attention to choosing the plot and occasion that are most suitable for the expressive language of plastic arts, which can be touching and thought-provoking."

On the question of creation, Teacher Ma (we all affectionately call him that according to national custom) always patiently guided everyone to think independently, and never forced others to modify according to his opinions. Some comrades often asked the teacher to give more specific ideas, hoping that the rules of creation could be prescribed in a formula, but he believed that "technical or craft-related problems can be taught, but there is no fixed formula to pass on artistic conception and image creation. These completely come from the painter's wisdom and feelings in life. Poetic fantasies often bring fresh and wonderful artistic conceptions. What the teacher has to do here can only inspire students to pay attention to observing and discovering meaningful things. Only when you are full of excitement, desire, and tireless exploration of appropriate forms of expression can what you require appear actively and vividly on the canvas!" After a year of creative practice, we realized that everything in future works must be something that the painter is deeply moved by and thoroughly understands in life, thus becoming a part of his own flesh and blood. Every character image can only be truly expressed in its own unique artistic language when it is mature in the depths of the soul. This is something that no one can teach or replace. For the exploration of an image, we often rack our brains and search our guts, like the labor pains before childbirth, and endure many tense days and nights. I remember that a comrade "broke down" in the middle of his creation, and didn't even move a brush for several days, always staring at the canvas opposite, pacing and lost. When Teacher Ma saw this situation, he walked over to him with concern and said: "Comrade, take your hands out of your pockets and go outside to paint, to find. Life and wild nature can tell you a lot. Otherwise, continuing to suffer in the house for a hundred days will be in vain!" Teacher Ma attached great importance to sketching, but he didn't think that as long as you painted models or landscape studies and came back, you would be done. On the contrary, when he saw someone posing models, and moving them onto the screen stroke by stroke in an indifferent way, he couldn't tolerate it and immediately criticized: "Creation is the artist's conscientious excitement and feeling, not an old lady knitting socks. She can chat or doze off while knitting, but the artist's work is full of burning passion and all-out effort every moment. For the success of creation, even going through fire and water is a pleasure! Surikov once said: 'If I want to paint hell, I would rather take the model to hell together!' These words seem too mysterious to outsiders, but the fact is so. The artist must share the fate and breathe with the protagonist of his work. If he is not moved by it himself, then how can he produce works that move others?!"

For two years, Teacher Ma has been with us day and night, making people feel that he is not only the most admirable teacher, but also our closest friend in life. In daily interactions, there is no distinction of nationality or language barrier. We are truly as close as brothers and sisters, confiding in each other and talking about everything. I remember once, someone put a few Soviet painting pictures printed in "Spark" magazine in the studio for reference. Teacher Ma came over and looked at them and said: "If you need to refer to them, you must choose some well-printed reproductions. These two paintings themselves are not very good, and with the addition of poor printing, the colors of the original have been completely distorted. So, the more you learn from it, the bigger the deception!" Then, he said humorously: "Chinese comrades are all honest, and so is learning from the Soviet Union, but if you are too honest, you have to be careful. To be honest, there are many excellent masterpieces in modern Soviet painting, but there are also many things that seem intimidating at first glance but are actually dry and boring. If you don't choose and learn everything you see, you will suffer. There are many precious heritages in Chinese national art. Contemporary painters should study them carefully and absorb rich nutrients from this endless treasure. I hope that your oil paintings can take root and grow in the soil of your motherland, and bloom with flowers with authentic national characteristics!"

Now, our oil painting training class has graduated, and the graduation creation exhibition has met the people of the capital. Our newly graduated oil painting apprentices, with immense gratitude and reluctant feelings, express our sincerest gratitude to our beloved teacher, Professor Konstantin M. Maksimov, and hope that the leaders and friends who care about us, the audience, will give us more advice to help and nurture this budding art, so that it can bloom in the socialist garden of our motherland!

    油画训练班毕业作品展览会已经在首都揭幕了。这是我们十九位青年美术工作者在苏联名画家、斯大林奖金两次获得者康·麦·马克西莫夫教授两年苦心教导下所获得的学习成果。展出的一百多件作品，不过是一支刚刚破土而出的鲜嫩幼苗，但在它成长的每一瞬间，都凝聚着师生们呕心沥血的辛勤劳动和甘苦与共的深挚友情。一年前开始动手搞毕业创作时，每个人心中都有些惶惶然，深知自己在油画技巧上根底浅薄，在这样短短的时间里完成一幅比较完整的创作，实在是没有把握。马克西莫夫老师却满怀信心地鼓励我们说：“呶，别看莫斯科苏里柯夫美术学院是六年制，而你们却只学习两年，但我却完全相信中国青年的才能和创造性。再说你们都具有一定的斗争生活经历，难道就没有什么迫切需要表现的东西吗？不要怕，勇敢加智慧就可以创造出奇迹来！”
    不久，我们都根据自己的意图和素材勾画出草图，老师看过之后，正确地指出，有些只是简单地叙述事件过程或插图式的处理题材。他说：“绘画不同于文学、戏剧或电影，不能连续地把生活中一切细枝末节都陈述出来，画面上只能表现生活事件中的片断，由此使人了解到它的过去和未来将是怎样的；例如列宾所作“伊凡杀子”一画，主要的不是描写暴君伊凡如何杀死了他的儿子，更重要的是揭示了新的人性的出现。当那个残忍的父亲在狂怒中杀死了亲生儿子之后的一霎那，久已丧尽的人性和良心突然复活了，他用痉挛的手紧按住王子头部致命的伤口，浓浊的血流从指缝间迸射出来，一切都显示出永远无可挽回了。……当你们处理自己的题材时，要注意选择最适于造型艺术语言所表达的、能够动人心弦并引起深思的情节与场合。”
    在有关创作的问题上，马老师（我们都按照民族习惯如此亲?地称呼他）总是循循善诱地启发大家去独立思考，从不强求别人按照他的意见进行修改，有的同志常常要老师更具体地出主意，希望最好把创作的规律开出个仿单来，但他认为“属于技术性或手艺性的问题是可以教的，然而像艺术的构思和形象的创造却从无成方可传，这些，完全出自画家的智慧和在生活中的感受，诗意的幻想常常会带来新鲜奇妙的意境，教师在这里所要作的，只能启发同学去注意观察、发现有意义的东西，只有你满怀激动、渴望和不懈地探寻恰当的表现形式，才能使你所要求的东西积极生动地出现在画布上！”经过一年来的创作实践，使我们体会到未来作品中的一切，必须是画家在生活中深受感动，彻底了解，从而成为自身血肉的一部分的东西，每个人物形象，只有在心灵深处酝酿成熟时，才能真正以自己独特的艺术语言表达出来，这是任何人所不能传授更不能代替的。为着一个形象的探索，我们常常绞尽脑汁，搜索枯肠，像产前的阵疼一样，熬过多少个紧张的日日夜夜。我记得有位同志在创作的中途“抛了锚”，连续几天竟没有动一笔，老是凝视着对面的画布徘徊、怅惘，马老师看到这种情景，关切地走近他说：“同志，把手从你的裤袋里伸出来，到外面去画、去找，生活和野外的大自然可以告诉你很多，否则，在房子里继续苦恼一百天也是徒劳无益的！”马老师很重视写生，但并非认为只要画了模特儿或风景习作回来就大功告成了，正相反，当他看到有人摆了模特儿，无动于中地一笔一笔原本原样搬上画面时，却是不能容忍地立刻加以指责：“创作，是艺术家良心的激动和感受，不是老太太织袜子，她可以边织边聊天，或者打瞌睡，而艺术家的工作，每时每刻都是充满灼热的激情，全力以赴的。为了创作的成功，即使赴汤蹈火都乐意去做！苏里柯夫曾说过：‘假使我要画地狱，情愿带了模特儿一起到地狱去！’这些话在行外人听来似乎过分玄虚，但事实毕竟如此。艺术家必须要与自己作品的主人公同命运、共呼吸，假使自己不为之感动，那么又怎能产生感动别人的作品呢？！”
    两年来，马老师同我们朝夕相处，使人感到他不仅是最可敬佩的老师，而且是我们生活中最亲密的朋友，日常交往中毫无国籍之分、言语之隔，真正是亲如手足，彼此推心置腹，无所不谈。记得有一次，有人在画室里摆了几张“星火”杂志印的苏联画片作参考，马老师近前看了看说：“假使需要参考的话，一定要挑选些精印的复制品，这两张画本身就不高明，再加上蹩脚的印刷，把原作的色彩全部走了样，那么，你学它学得愈像，上的当也就愈大了！”接着，他很诙谐地说：“中国同志们都是老老实实的，学习苏联也是如此，可是过分老实了，就要当心哪。说实在话，苏联现代绘画有很多优秀的杰作，也有不少乍一看来挺唬人的而实际上是干瘪瘪枯燥乏味的东西，倘使不加选择，见啥学啥，就会吃亏的。中国民族艺术中有很多珍贵的遗产，当代画家应该好好研究，从这无尽的宝藏中吸收丰富营养。希望你们的油画能够在自己祖国的土壤中生根滋长，开放出具有道地的民族特色的鲜花来！”
    现在，我们油画训练班已经结业，毕业创作展览会已同首都人民见面了，我们刚刚出师的油画学徒，怀着万分感激而又难割难舍的依依之情，向我们亲爱的老师康·麦·马克西莫夫教授致最诚挚的谢意，并希望关心我们的领导同志和朋友们、观众们，多多赐教，帮助和培育这一枝初成的艺术蓓蕾，使它在祖国社会主义的百花园中迎风怒放！
