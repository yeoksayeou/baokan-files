Public Representative
By our reporter Cao Baoming

In December 1955, Huang Qijia reported to the joint state-private Da Zhong Silk and Cloth Store to serve as the public representative. Some private staff members privately said, "Oh, a kid has come to the store." This was because Huang Qijia was only twenty-four years old at the time, and even the youngest person in the store was older than him. However, after this "kid" worked with everyone for a year, the store became one of the advanced units in Wuhan City. Three of the store's seven private staff members were recognized as advanced workers in the district for their outstanding work. Private staff generally reflected that they enjoyed their work and made great progress after the joint operation.

Huang Qijia was not familiar with the silk and cloth retail business, while the private staff members had one or two decades of business experience. Therefore, he paid great attention to leveraging the enthusiasm of the private staff members in his work. The store's director was originally Yu Zhichen, from the private side, who was responsible for overall leadership. He and Liu Shiyi, also from the private side, served as deputy directors, responsible for personnel, finance, and business, respectively. They first established several systems: upper-level administrative meetings would be attended by whoever was responsible for the relevant work, who would then return to convey the information and discuss it together. Upper-level administrative documents, except for a few top-secret ones, would be read first by the relevant directors, who would sign their opinions, and then circulated for everyone to read and discuss together. The store's work would first be discussed at the directors' office meeting, a decision made, and then the relevant director would be responsible for implementing it.

Initially, the employees did not trust the private director. Yu Zhichen told Huang Qijia, "When you assign work, everyone takes notes and discusses it seriously. When we assign work, people don't speak during discussions, and some even go off to do other things. It's better for you to assign the work." Huang Qijia then held a separate meeting of union members to explain the redemption policy, emphasizing the importance of leveraging the enthusiasm of the private staff, and told everyone: "The work assigned by the private director has all been decided after discussion at the directors' office meeting." For the first few times when the private director assigned work, he accompanied him, sometimes adding supplementary explanations, indicating that the public representative agreed with this approach. After everyone trusted the private director, all matters were decided at the directors' office meeting, and then each person took responsibility for implementing them separately.

Store Director Yu Zhichen was a standing committee member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, vice chairman of the trade association, representative of the district political consultative conference, and a municipal people's representative, with many social activities outside the store. Some employees suspected that he was sleeping in at home and not coming to work. Some private staff members also said, "We contribute capital, and he's just using it to earn status for himself outside." Therefore, Yu Zhichen also had concerns. He said, "After I'm out for a few days, I feel embarrassed to enter the store. Everyone is very busy at home, and they're all watching me." Coincidentally, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce also wanted him to promote the sale of government bonds at this time. After understanding this situation, Huang Qijia told him, "Both social work and store work must be done. See which work is more urgent and do that one first." At the same time, he explained the situation to the employees and private staff members. They also came up with a solution to the conflict between social work and store work: every day when Yu Zhichen arrived somewhere, he would first make a phone call back to the store, so that he could be found immediately if there were any major issues. In the evening, when he passed by the store on his way home, the three directors would hold a brief meeting, each briefly discussing the day's situation. This way, the store knew what he was doing outside every day and could support him, and he also understood the store's situation and could work with peace of mind. He was commended by the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce for his work in promoting government bond sales. Later, when social activities decreased, he was responsible for the store's economic restructuring work, understanding historical commercial experience, reforming institutions and systems, and researching sales characteristics, which he also did very well. He said, "I went from being an apprentice to a capitalist. Only now is the most enjoyable period for me."

To strengthen the education of private staff members, the store also established a monthly lifestyle meeting for private staff. On days off, Huang Qijia and several private staff members would go to Binjiang Park or other places together, exchanging opinions while having fun. When the employees checked the conditions for competition, they also allowed the private staff to participate and check their own eligibility for merit. The distance between private staff members and the public representative and employees gradually decreased, and they were also willing to talk about their feelings. Yu Zhichen even talked to Huang Qijia about an argument he had with his wife at home, asking Huang to help his wife.

After the enthusiasm of the private staff was raised, new problems continued to arise. Once, Huang Qijia was away at a meeting, and many demobilized soldiers came to buy cloth. In order to sell more goods, Liu Shiyi sold 966 feet of remnants of bed sheet and quilt cover fabric without coupons. When Huang Qijia returned, the cloth had already been sold, and he didn't pay attention. Later, the city company came to investigate the issue, saying that they had "violated state regulations and had capitalist business thinking." At the time, Yu Zhichen still thought that it was sold by a salesperson and that the responsibility lay with the salesperson. However, Huang Qijia analyzed the situation and believed that the administrative director's policy thinking was not clear, which made everyone truly learn a lesson in their thinking. Since then, the store had only two errors of discrepancies between cloth coupons and accounts throughout the year, becoming the second in the city in implementing the cloth coupon system.

Before the wage reform, some private staff members claimed to have financial difficulties and wanted to apply for subsidies. Huang Qijia and everyone analyzed that Yu Zhongchuan (private) had a monthly income of more than 50 yuan and supported a family of eight, which was truly difficult, and the enterprise provided subsidies. Yang Xiaoqing (private) and his wife had a monthly income of more than 70 yuan and supported a family of five, which was not very difficult, and no subsidies were given. When Huang Qijia explained this issue to him, he agreed, but he had a lot of opinions afterward.

At this time, the store was learning about the living conditions of the employees, and Huang Qijia invited Yang Xiaoqing and representatives from the union to visit the homes of the employees together. The first family they visited was a new worker who had been unemployed for a long time. At that time, they couldn't even afford to cook, and they immediately gave them a subsidy of four yuan. The second family they visited had a monthly income of 47 yuan and supported a family of seven, but the housewife tried to wash clothes for others and asked her children to paste paper bags for others during their spare time, barely maintaining their livelihood. Then, they visited the home of a private staff member. This family had an income of more than 90 yuan and supported a family of five, which was much better than the employees. After Yang Xiaoqing returned from the visit, he told the private staff members, "Looking at the lives of the employees, our lives are much better. I really didn't know that the lives of the employees were so difficult."

Their store has a total of more than 30 employees, and there is not much administrative work. Huang Qijia invited the private director to go downstairs to participate in business whenever he had time. Initially, Yu Zhichen just stood and watched, and some employees reflected, "Is he supervising us like in the past?" Huang Qijia discussed with the private director again: if there was a longer amount of spare time, they would sell goods at the counter; if the time was shorter, they would take goods outside the counter and greet customers. Originally, the higher authorities stipulated that cloth coupons should be collected before cutting the cloth, which sometimes caused customer resentment, and some salespeople also found it troublesome. When Huang Qijia and others sold goods, they took the lead in abiding by the system, so that the system of collecting cloth coupons first could be implemented.

According to Ma Xiaoan (private), the store director who took office in January this year, spending time participating in business like this can directly understand the demands of customers, which is very beneficial for making sales plans and improving business.

Ma Xiaoan also mentioned that some people have recently advocated for abolishing the public representatives in joint state-private enterprises. He said, "It is not appropriate to abolish the public representatives."

He first analyzed, "Joint ventures have public-private relations, class relations between the private side and employees, and relations between private parties, which are very complex. Taking our relationship with employees as an example, at the beginning of the joint venture, there was a distance between the thoughts of both parties. On the one hand, we must rely on our own dedication to our duties to win the trust of the employees, and on the other hand, we must rely on the public representatives to do a good job for both parties so that both parties can trust and work together. After past contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will continue to arise. It is difficult to resolve them relying solely on the private staff."

He then talked about how he was striving to learn the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of the working class, but he still needed the continuous help of the public representatives. He cited a recent incident, saying, "Luo Zhaiming, a private staff member in the store, was on sick leave for more than two months. According to the State Council's regulations, his salary should be discounted. I discussed with Comrade Huang Qijia to pay 60%, and if Luo Zhaiming has financial difficulties, the administration will subsidize a portion. But how much should be subsidized? I represent the interests of the private side and think that another 30% should be subsidized, for a total of 90% of the original salary. Comrade Huang Qijia studied the labor insurance contract and thought that employees with longer seniority only receive 90% of their salary during sick leave. Subsidizing Luo Zhaiming like this would not allow the superiority of the labor insurance contract to be reflected. Everyone discussed again and decided to pay 80%, which took care of Luo Zhaiming and also implemented the policy. Although there is only a difference of 10%, it reflects that we have not studied the policies enough, and the public representatives can still see the problems comprehensively. Perhaps some people think that after more than a year of joint operation, their level is almost the same, and they can do it without a public representative. This is not in line with reality."

Huang Qijia said, "When I first came, my relationship with the private side was not this good. At that time, I only paid attention to controlling the seal, managing the purse, and doing personnel work well. I did everything myself, and the private director had the title but no power. Later, I listened to the report of the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and read the documents, and the private director repeatedly made suggestions indirectly, and my thinking became clearer. I paid attention to leveraging the enthusiasm of the private staff. Later, in the execution, I once made decisions myself twice because I wanted to get things done quickly without discussing them with the private director. The private director raised it afterward, and I also made a self-criticism." He also said, "The current problem is that we pay more attention to the private staff who hold administrative positions, and we do less work for the general employees on the private side. The Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association also do very little work for these people. These people are not very active in their emotions, and some even say to the private director: 'We carry the sedan chair, and you sit in the sedan chair. We carry you out, and you abandon us.'" Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the work for these people. Then, Ma Xiaoan said, "When it comes to the issue of power, I think I have all the power that the public representatives have. The current problem to be solved is the issue of the power of grassroots enterprises. Now it is stipulated that expenses of more than ten yuan must be reported to the higher authorities for approval before they can be spent, regardless of the size of the store. This is not very practical and makes the work very inconvenient."

    公方代表
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    1955年12月，黄其家去公私合营大中绸布店报到，担任公方代表。有的私方人员就在私下讲：“咳，店里来了个小孩。”因为黄其家当时才二十四岁，而店里最年轻的也比他大。但是，就是这个“小孩”和大家共同工作一年以后，这个店成了武汉市的先进单位之一。店里七个私方人员，有三个因为工作有成绩被评为区里的先进工作者。私方人员普遍反映自己在合营后工作愉快，进步很大。
    黄其家对绸布零售业务不熟，而私方人员都有一二十年的业务经验，因此他在工作中很注意发挥私方人员的积极性。他们店里的主任原由私方余智琛担任，负责全面领导，他和私方刘士诒作副主任，分工负责人事、财务和业务工作。他们首先建立了几个制度：上级行政召开的会议，同谁负责的工作有关，就由谁去参加，然后回来传达，共同研究。上级行政发的文件，除个别绝密件外，都由有关主任先看，签署意见，然后大家传阅，再共同研究。店里的工作，都先在主任办公会上讨论，作出决定，由有关主任负责执行。
    最初，职工不信任私方主任。余智琛向黄其家讲：“你布置工作，大家都作笔记，认真讨论。我们布置工作，大家讨论时不发言，有的还去作别的事。还是你去布置好些。”黄其家又单独召开工会会员大会，向职工们讲解赎买政策，说明发挥私方人员积极性的重要意义，并告诉大家：“私方主任布置的工作，都是经过主任办公会研究决定的。”开始几次，私方主任布置工作，他还陪着，有时并加以补充说明，表明公方代表是同意这样作的。等大家信任私方主任后，各种事情在主任办公会作出决定，就各自分头负责执行。
    店主任余智琛是市工商联的常委、同业公会的副主委、市区政协代表、市人民代表，在外面的社会活动很多。有的职工就怀疑他是在家睡懒觉，不进店工作。有的私方人员也说：“我们出的资本，尽让他在外面替自己挣地位。”因此余智琛也有了顾虑。他说：“我在外面搞几天以后，都不好意思进店门。大家在家都很忙，尽望着我。”碰巧市工商联这时还要他去搞公债推销工作。黄其家了解这个情况后，便向他讲：“社会工作和店里工作都要作，看那个工作紧急些就先作那个。”同时向职工和私方人员作了解释。他们还想出了一个解决社会工作和店里工作矛盾的办法：余智琛每天到了那里，就先挂个电话回来，店里有什么重大事情，马上就能找到他。晚上，他回家路过店里，三个主任就开个碰头会，用十多分钟，各把当天的情况说一说。这样，店里知道他每天在外作什么，能支持他，他也了解店里情况，能安心工作。他在公债推销工作中，受到了市工商联的表扬。后来，社会活动少些，他又负责商店的经济改组工作，了解商业历史经验，改革机构、制度，研究销售特点，等等，也搞得很好。他说：“我从学徒做到资本家。只有现在才是我最痛快的时期。”
    为了加强对私方人员的教育，这个店还建立了一个月一次的私方人员生活会。在休假的日子，黄其家和几个私方人员一起去滨江公园或其他地方，一边玩，一边交换意见。在职工们检查竞赛条件时，他们也让私方人员参加，检查自己的立功条件。私方人员对公方代表和职工的隔阂渐渐减少，也肯谈心里话。余智琛在家同他爱人吵了嘴，也向黄其家谈了，要黄帮助他的爱人。
    私方人员的积极性提高以后，也还不断出现新的问题。有一次，黄其家开会去了，有很多复员军人来买布，刘士诒为了多销货，就将一些卧单布、被面布的布头子免票卖了九百六十六尺。黄其家回来时，布已卖了，也没有注意。后来，市公司来追查这个问题，说他们“违反国家规定，是资本主义经营思想”。当时，余智琛还认为这是业务员卖的，责任在业务员。但黄其家分析了情况，认为是行政主任政策思想不明确，使大家真正在思想上接受了教训。此后，这个店去年一年就只发生了两笔布票与账面不符的差错，在贯彻布票制度上成了全市第二名。
    在工资改革以前，有些私方人员叫生活困难，要申请补助。黄其家和大家分析了余仲川（私方）一月收入五十多元，负担八口人生活，是真困难，由企业给予补助。杨晓青（私方）夫妇一月收入七十多元，五口人生活，并不很困难，就没有补助。黄其家向他解释这个问题时，他也同意了，但事后很有意见。
    这时，店里正了解职工的生活情况，黄其家便约上杨晓青和工会代表一起去访问职工家庭。他们去的第一家是个新进店的工人，过去长期没职业，当时连锅都揭不开，他们便当场给补助了四块钱。他们去的第二家是一月收入四十七元，七口人过活，但这家的主妇想法替人洗衣服，叫孩子课余给人糊纸袋，生活也勉强维持了。接着，他们又去一个私方人员家里访问。这家有九十多元收入，五口人过活，比职工们强多了。杨晓青一访问回来，就向私方人员讲：“看一看职工的生活，我们的生活还是好得多。我过去真不知道职工生活这么困难。”
    他们店里一共三十多个从业人员，行政工作不多。黄其家便邀私方主任一有空就下楼参加营业。最初，余智琛下去只是站站看看，有的职工就反映：“是不是还像过去一样监督我们？”黄其家又同私方主任研究：如空余时间长一些，就在柜台里卖货；时间短一些，就在柜外拿货，招呼顾客。本来，上级规定要先收布票后扯布，有时惹起顾客反感，有的业务员也嫌麻烦。黄其家等人售货时，就首先带头遵守制度，使先收布票的制度得以贯彻。
    据今年1月到职的店主任马小庵（私方）谈：这样抽时间参加营业后，能直接了解顾客的要求，对作好销售计划，改进业务，都有很大好处。
    马小庵也谈到最近有人主张取消公私合营企业公方代表的问题，他说：“取消公方代表是不恰当的。”
    他首先分析说：“合营企业有公私关系、私方与职工的阶级关系、私方与私方的关系，很复杂。就以我们与职工的关系来说，初合营时，双方思想都有距离，一方面固然靠自己守职尽责争取职工的信任，一方面也得靠公方代表作好双方的工作，才能做到双方信任共事。过去的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾还会不断出现，光靠私方人员，是很难解决的。”
    他接着又谈到他自己是在努力学习工人阶级的立场、观点和方法，但还得公方代表不断帮助。他举了最近的一桩事说：“店里私方人员罗宅明生病休假两个月以上，按照国务院规定薪金要打折扣，我同黄其家同志研究按60％支付，如罗宅明生活确有困难，再由行政补助一部分。但补助多少呢？我代表私方利益，认为应再补助30％，连薪金一共发原薪金90％。黄其家同志研究了劳保合同，认为工龄较长的职工生病期间也才支付薪金90％，这样补助罗宅明，就使劳保合同的优越性不能体现出来。大家又讨论决定为80％，既照顾了罗宅明，也贯彻了政策。虽然只是10％的差别，但这就反映出我们对政策学习还不够，还是公方代表能全面看问题。也许有的人以为经过一年多的合营，自己的水平已经差不多了，没有公方代表自己也能行，这是不合乎实际的。”
    黄其家说：“我初来时，同私方的关系并没有这样好。我当时就只注意掌好印把子，管好钱袋子和作好人事工作，事事自己搞，私方主任有职无权。后来我听了团中央统战部长的报告，读了文件，私方主任又一再侧面提意见，我的思想才明确起来，注意发挥私方人员的积极性。后来在执行中，我因为干事情图快，也曾经有两次没有同私方主任商量，自己就作出决定。私方主任事后提了出来，我也作了检查。他又说：“目前的问题是我们对担负行政职务的私方人员比较注意，对私方的一般从业人员作的工作少些。工商联和民建对这部分人也很少作工作。这些人在情绪上不够积极，有的还说私方主任：“我们抬轿子，你坐轿子。我们把你抬出去了，你就丢下我们不管。”因此还需要加强对这些人的工作。接着，马小庵说：“要谈到有权的问题，我认为公方代表有的权，我现在都有。目前要解决的是基层企业的权的问题，现在规定十元以上的费用就得报上级批准后才能开支，无论大小商店都是如此，这就不大切合实际，弄得工作很不方便。”
