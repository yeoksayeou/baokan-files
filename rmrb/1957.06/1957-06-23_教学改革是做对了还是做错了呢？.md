Was the Teaching Reform Right or Wrong?
    Jin Xiwu, Professor, Tsinghua University

    Teaching reform is a major event in Chinese higher education. Through the 1952 teaching reform, China's higher education underwent profound changes and achieved great development. Was this reform right or wrong? In addition, there are other issues related to teaching reform. During the recent rectification movement, many people have become interested in and paid attention to these issues. I would like to briefly share my views on these issues, starting from higher industrial education, hoping to receive criticism and correction.

    How should we evaluate the teaching reform?

    I believe that the teaching reform was basically right, and it has achieved great success, but it also has some shortcomings.

    Standards for Determining Whether Teaching Reform is Correct

    I believe that the main standard for judging whether the teaching reform is correct should be whether it meets the requirements of the state for higher education. As far as higher industrial schools are concerned, they are to train engineering and technical personnel for the country, which is the requirement of the state for higher industrial schools. So, does the teaching reform meet this requirement? I believe it basically meets this requirement. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

    I. Training cadres according to plan. We are a socialist country, and we must carry out socialist industrialization and develop various industries in a planned and proportionate way. We must not only carry out this planned industrialization but also carry it out as soon as possible. Industrialization requires large-scale capital construction work. It needs funds, raw materials, and technical equipment. But more importantly, it also needs a large number of skilled workers and technical cadres at all levels. The specific task of higher industrial schools is to train senior technical cadres according to plan as soon as possible. Since the country's industrial construction is developing according to plan and proportion, then the training of industrial construction talents must also be carried out according to plan. The logic is easy to understand. After the teaching reform, higher industrial schools across the country conducted a comprehensive adjustment and arrangement based on the above needs, established a small number of comprehensive industrial universities, and many single-discipline and multi-discipline industrial colleges. In addition, the Soviet Union's higher education experience was used to reform the teaching system, teaching content, and teaching methods, thoroughly changing the old-type higher industrial schools that served the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society and were led by bourgeois ideology, and becoming new-type higher industrial schools that serve the socialist society and are led by proletarian ideology, thereby ensuring the delivery of a large number of technical cadres meeting certain specifications to the country. Obviously, in order to complete the task of higher industrial schools, such reform is absolutely necessary. How much has higher industrial education developed since liberation? Taking Tsinghua University as an example alone can illustrate the general situation. Tsinghua University now has more than 8,000 full-time students, plus night school and training classes, the total number of students is nearly 10,000, which is about five times that before liberation. In the short eight years after liberation, the expansion of school buildings is nearly double that before liberation. As for the number of graduates, it is more than the total number of graduates in the forty years before liberation. Just imagine, if it were not for the teaching reform, how could we have achieved such great success?

    II. Training cadres by specialty. With the development of science and technology and the division of labor in production departments, the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed. Therefore, the training of technical cadres must adapt to this. If we still train some engineering and technical personnel in a general way as before liberation, it will not be able to meet the needs of current industrial construction. Therefore, it is very necessary to train cadres by specialty according to the needs of industrial construction or production departments. Cadres trained by specialty can have specialized skills. After graduating from school, they can take up practical work after a short period of training, which is very necessary to ensure the speed of industrial construction development. Here, I would like to raise such a question. Some people oppose training cadres by specialty. They believe that there is no doubt that the socialist education system should train cadres according to plan, but it does not necessarily have to be trained by specialty. Some people even pointed out that Soviet universities had majors in the Tsarist era, so he believes that training cadres by specialty does not represent the characteristics of the socialist education system. However, regardless of which country or which era the specialized education system began in, if this system can serve the socialist education cause well, why must we resolutely oppose it? Training talents according to plan requires not only numbers but also categories or varieties. What represents this category or variety is the specialty. May I ask, if we do not use the method of training by specialty, how can we accurately reflect the purpose of training according to plan? Of course, there should also be certain restrictions on training cadres by specialty. If the specialty is divided too narrowly and finely, it may not only cause difficulties in matching the work when assigning jobs, but also may not be conducive to adapting to the development of science and technology and the transfer of work. Therefore, it should be appropriately prevented. Due to space limitations, I will not discuss here how to reasonably set up specialties based on the needs of scientific and technological development and China's specific situation.

    III. Having a clear training goal. Whether higher industrial schools should have a certain training goal has been a hot topic of discussion throughout the country for some time in the past. As far as the Beijing area is concerned, most teachers in higher industrial schools believe that higher industrial schools should have a certain training goal and that it should be engineers, although a few teachers still have different opinions. Personally, I agree that engineers should be the training goal of higher industrial schools. In my opinion, it is as simple and easy to understand that higher industrial schools should train engineers as it is that medical schools should train doctors and normal colleges should train teachers. The problem is very simple. Since higher industrial schools have the task of delivering senior engineering and technical personnel to the country, and the most important of these senior engineering and technical personnel are engineers, then if higher industrial schools do not train engineers, who will train them? Naturally, the so-called engineer here is understood as a "profession" rather than a specific "position" or "rank." In fact, higher industrial schools should only enable graduates to initially possess the ability to engage in engineering work, and it is impossible to be exactly the same as engineers with many years of production experience. Some people raise the question, isn't this a kind of formalism? I don't think this is a kind of formalism, but it represents a teaching requirement and teaching guiding ideology. Because if we admit that the training of cadres should be carried out in a planned and specialized way, then the problem is only half solved. The other half is, to what extent should students be trained to have the ability? We must determine a precise indicator for the level of graduates. For regular graduates of higher industrial schools, I believe that this precise indicator is the engineer. After determining this indicator, we can arrange the teaching plan and teaching content according to the requirements of engineers' work ability. In this way, everyone can have a unified understanding of the purpose and requirements of teaching work. Engineers must be able to apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems. Determining the training goal as engineers, therefore, also establishes the teaching guiding ideology of theory linking with practice, which is beyond doubt for engineering education. I hope that the teaching guiding ideology of theory linking with practice that I put forward here will not be misunderstood as advocating that students should be instilled with too much specific production knowledge in the teaching content. How to correctly reflect the teaching ideology of theory linking with practice will be discussed below.

    Establishing a Correct Teaching Guiding Ideology

    Education is to train talents for the country. Therefore, establishing a correct teaching guiding ideology is absolutely necessary. As the teaching guiding ideology of socialist industrial education, I believe it should include at least the following aspects:

    I. All-round development;

    II. Combining technology with politics and economy;

    III. Theory linking with practice.

    As engineers of New China, they must be balanced in their intellectual, moral, and physical development, and they must have a worldview of serving socialist society. In order to meet these requirements, the teaching guiding ideology of all-round development and combining technology with politics will play a great role. Theory linking with practice represents the materialistic way of thinking and is the correct ideological guideline for people to handle any affairs. It is of even greater significance to engineering technology education. Some people say that engineering technology education has always been theory linking with practice. But I believe that only after the teaching reform did we particularly emphasize and truly consciously carry out teaching work according to this teaching principle, and only after the teaching reform did this principle get concretely implemented through the formulation of teaching plans. In the current teaching plans of various engineering majors, in terms of teaching content, there are general basic theoretical courses, technical basic courses, and professional or specialized courses. In terms of teaching methods, there are classroom lectures, exercise classes, laboratory classes, course design, teaching and production internships, and finally graduation work or graduation design. This arrangement clearly reflects the teaching principle of gradual progress from general to specific, from theory to practice. Through a series of such teaching links, we transform a high school graduate who is unfamiliar with production into an engineer who has initially mastered production. In this complex and arduous training process, the teaching ideology of theory linking with practice has played a huge guiding role.

    By the way, let's talk about another issue. Since the central government put forward the slogan of marching towards science last year, there has been a tendency to value theory and despise practice in the national education and academic circles. Under the influence of this tendency, during the revision of the teaching plan, some people proposed to vigorously strengthen basic courses and to merge or reduce professional courses as much as possible. Some engineers in factories and teachers in schools are also uneasy about their positions and are single-mindedly yearning for the Academy of Sciences. The biggest impact is on college students. This tendency has caused them to have a wrong understanding of the role of professional courses, production internships, and graduation design. Some students even proposed not to study professional courses, not to participate in production internships, and not to do graduation design. Many graduates this year expressed their unwillingness to work in factories and mines when filling out their job applications. I think this tendency is unhealthy. It is true that in order to develop scientific research, it is necessary to emphasize improving the country's academic theoretical level. But while emphasizing the importance of theory, we must never belittle the importance of practice. The dialectical relationship between theory and practice must be recognized. Otherwise, there is a danger of creating a situation where theory is divorced from practice in academic and teaching work. This is not conducive to improving teaching, developing science, and developing production. This is an issue that deserves our special attention.

    How to treat the issue of wanting to cancel or reduce professional courses as much as possible? Some people say that the quality of teaching after the teaching reform is terrible (this issue will be discussed below) because too many professional courses are being learned, so they should be cancelled or reduced as much as possible. First of all, it should be pointed out that professional courses play a major role in training engineers. Professional courses are not all empirical things, specific and trivial knowledge without theory, as some people have criticized. In my opinion, anything that is systematically summarized from production practice and plays a guiding role in the further development of production is theory, and this theory does not necessarily have to be expressed in mathematics. The important role of basic courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry in training engineers should be affirmed. We have every reason to ask to learn them better, but if we do not learn enough professional courses, I am afraid that we will not even be able to raise questions when taking up practical work, and it is impossible to be a competent engineer. Professional courses can not only consolidate basic theoretical knowledge but also play a great role in cultivating students' thinking methods and working abilities that link theory with practice. Can professional courses be learned after going to work? In fact, after learning a certain foundation and professional courses, and then returning to further improve basic theory at work according to work needs, it can make theoretical learning more purposeful and easy to achieve twice the result with half the effort. This dialectical process of understanding is completely reasonable. Now there are also many engineering and technical personnel who graduated before liberation who come to universities to listen to professional courses. Some schools also specially send teachers to factories and mines to teach professional courses. The role and necessity of professional courses can be fully demonstrated by this.

    The Quality of Cadre Training Has Improved Significantly

    What is the quality of cadres trained after the teaching reform? I believe that even students trained during the teaching reform process have significantly improved in quality compared to before liberation, both in general and on average. This is mainly reflected in the ability to handle practical work. The engineers who have been invited to the school to preside over the graduation design defense at Tsinghua University for several consecutive years have also expressed the same opinion on this point. Based on the quality of the graduation design, many students' working abilities are considered to have reached at least the level of an engineer. Graduates who are already at work also have better performance in handling production problems. For example, some of the graduates of the mechanical manufacturing major of Tsinghua University in 1955 are now serving as tool design team leaders and metrology room directors, and they are competent in their work. One student who was assigned to the assembly workshop of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Factory improved the manually operated electric drill into a semi-automatic one, increasing the productivity by twenty-seven times. Five-year students, even before graduating, put forward valuable rationalization proposals during production internships. For example, two students majoring in foundry who interned at the Changchun Automobile Factory last year proposed a design for an automatic sand falling device, which was praised by Soviet experts in the factory and has been adopted, manufactured, and applied to the production line. The expert also said: "He will take the design drawings back to the Soviet Union." Many such examples can be cited. These all show that today's university graduates have a certain independent working ability to solve practical production problems.

    Some people mentioned that today's university graduates have too poor a foundation, although they can solve the current production problems, they cannot engage in pioneering or scientific research work. First of all, it should be pointed out that until last year, almost all the university graduates distributed to the industrial sector were the first batch of specialized or three- or four-year students who graduated after the teaching reform. Some of these students learned basic courses before the teaching reform, and some were in the early years of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea, the Three-Anti, and Five-Anti campaigns, etc., when there were many political and social activities. In addition, the level of teachers could not keep up shortly after the teaching reform. Therefore, these students were slightly less trained in basic aspects. As for regular five-year university graduates, except for Harbin Institute of Technology, only Tsinghua University will have the first batch this summer. It can be estimated that the basic training of regular university graduates will be better than in the early stage in the future. In addition, how to require even regular university graduates who have just left school in general is also a question worth discussing. I believe that for regular university graduates, in addition to generally requiring them to be able to solve relatively complex current production problems that graduates of secondary technical schools cannot solve and to carry out technological innovation (such as technological transformation) work to a certain extent, only a relatively excellent few can be appropriately required to engage in local and relatively simple scientific research work. I think it is too high to generally require ordinary university graduates to be able to engage in pioneering or scientific research work. Naturally, in order to add new forces to the country's scientific research, higher industrial schools also have the responsibility to work together with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientific research institutions to train engineering and technical talents of this higher level. There is no doubt about this. The four-year graduate students who were enrolled last year are the beginning of this effort. But any idea of ​​wanting to combine two steps into one and make excessive demands on ordinary university graduates, I think is unrealistic.

    Shortcomings and Errors of Teaching Reform

    The teaching reform has indeed achieved great success, but it also has considerable shortcomings or errors, which are worth checking and correcting to improve future work. First of all, overemphasizing objective requirements, pursuing quantity over quality, and paying attention to quantity but not enough to quality are one of the biggest shortcomings. Since the teaching reform, almost all universities across the country have felt very passive in their teaching work. In order to meet the country's needs for cadres, teachers are willing to contribute their strength. However, one-sidedly emphasizing objective needs, not considering subjective conditions well, and assigning tasks to universities that exceed actual needs have caused a great waste of human and material resources and affected the quality of teaching. Many teachers have opinions on this. The excessive enrollment last year is the best example. These relatively serious errors should attract the attention of all relevant departments. Secondly, on the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, it should be said that everyone's understanding is relatively consistent. However, not considering China's specific situation well and mechanically copying the Soviet experience has caused a tendency of formalism in many places, which has also caused great losses to teaching work. For example, there are many such examples in the implementation of teaching plans, teaching outlines, and other teaching methods. When formulating teaching plans, especially in the early stage of teaching reform, we wanted to "complete the five-year plan in four years," and at the same time, we did not consider the level of Chinese teachers and students well, resulting in a serious phenomenon of over-learning hours. On the examination and grading methods and the teacher workload system, many teachers also believe that there is a tendency of dogmatism or formalism. On the issue of learning foreign languages, before there were enough Russian teachers, failing to give full play to the potential of other foreign language teachers also affected the foreign language level of graduates in some schools. Thirdly, when implementing a new teaching measure, there are situations where uniformity is forced and mechanically unified. For example, the level of students entering each school is uneven, but the requirements of the teaching plan and teaching outline are the same. In addition, from a national perspective, in the past period, there were generally too many teaching method work, which to a certain extent also affected the improvement of teaching quality. The fact that the foreign language level of university graduates is not as good as in the past is indeed a problem that deserves special attention.

    The above shortcomings and errors have been raised in the process of revising the teaching plan last year. Many teachers have made sharp criticisms of these shortcomings and errors. Some correct opinions, such as: comprehensively strengthening the foundation (including scientific foundation, technical foundation, and professional foundation), reducing weekly class hours, increasing extracurricular time (especially for scientific foundation courses), strengthening experimental classes, adding elective courses, etc., have been accepted and reflected in the new teaching plan. However, the discussion of the issue is not thorough. In particular, some newspapers, such as Guangming Daily, have distorted and biased reports on teaching discussions, which has caused illusions among teachers across the country. In order to clarify the direction of higher industrial education and better train engineers who meet certain standards for the motherland, I think it would be beneficial to re-launch the teaching discussion.

    In short, the teaching reform is definitely successful, but of course, there are many shortcomings that need to be improved and overcome. The success of the teaching reform is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, any attempt to let the Communist Party withdraw from universities and weaken the Party's leadership is absolutely wrong and impossible. However, in order to improve the work of universities and overcome the harm of sectarianism, bureaucracy, and dogmatism, how to give more play to the positive factors of all parties and make the most of the role of experienced teachers on the basis of the current system of responsibility of the Party committee, and run universities well in the spirit of promoting democracy, is an issue that deserves further careful study.

### 教学改革是做对了还是做错了呢？

　　教学改革是做对了还是做错了呢？
　　清华大学教授　金希武
    教学改革是中国高等教育的一件大事。通过1952年教学改革，中国的高等教育发生了极为深刻的变化，并得到了很大的发展。究竟这一改革是做对了还是做错了呢？此外和教学改革有关的还有其他一些问题。对于这些问题，在最近的整风运动中又引起了很多人的兴趣和注意。我想从高等工业教育出发，就这些问题简单谈谈自己的看法，希望能得到批评和指正。
    对教学改革应当给予怎样的估计呢？
    我认为教学改革基本上是做对了，它取得了很大的成绩，但也有若干缺点。
    教学改革是否正确的标准
    判断教学改革是否正确的主要标准，我认为应当看它是否满足了国家对高等教育提出的要求。就高等工业学校而言，它是给国家培养工程技术人才的，这就是国家对高等工业学校提出的要求。那么教学改革是否满足了这一要求呢？我认为它基本上满足了这一要求。这主要体现在以下几方面：
    一、按计划培养干部。我们是一个社会主义的国家，要进行社会主义工业化，要有计划地按比例发展各种工业。我们不仅要进行这种有计划的工业化，而且还要尽快地进行这种工业化，工业化需要进行大规模的基本建设工作。它需要资金、原料和技术装备。但是更重要的，它还需要大量的技术工人和各级技术干部。高等工业学校的具体任务就是按计划尽快地培养高级技术干部。国家的工业建设既然是按计划按比例发展，那么工业建设人才的培养，也必须按计划培养，道理是容易理解的。教学改革后，全国高等工业学校根据上述需要进行了全盘的调整和安排，成立了少数综合性工业大学，很多单科性和多科性的工业学院。此外，还利用了苏联的高等教育经验进行了关于教学制度、教学内容和教学方法的改革，彻底改变了为半封建半殖民地社会服务的、受资产阶级思想领导的旧型的高等工业学校，成为为社会主义社会服务的受无产阶级思想领导的新型的高等工业学校，从而保证了向国家输送大量的合乎一定规格的技术干部。很显然，为了完成高等工业学校的任务，进行这种改革是绝对必要的。解放后高等工业学校究竟有多大发展呢？仅举清华大学一校为例，就可说明一般。清华大学现在共有正规学生八千多人，加上夜大学和训练班等，学生总数将近一万人，约等于解放前的五倍。解放后短短的八年，校舍扩充比之解放前将近一倍，至于毕业的学生八年比解放前四十年还要多。试想，假如不是因为进行了教学改革，如何能够取得这样伟大的成绩呢？
    二、按专业培养干部。随着科学技术的发展，生产部门的分工，愈来愈细。因之技术干部的培养必须与之相适应。假如仍像解放前那样一般地培养某种工程技术人才是不能满足现在工业建设的需要的。因之，根据工业建设或生产部门的需要按专业培养干部，就非常必要。按专业培养出来的干部，可以学有专长，从学校毕业后经过短期锻炼即可担任实际工作，这对保证工业建设发展的速度是非常必要的。这里顺便提出这样一个问题，有人反对按专业培养干部，他们认为社会主义教育制度应当按计划培养干部是没有疑问的，但不一定要按专业来培养。有人甚至还指出苏联的高等学校在帝俄时代就设有专业，所以他认为按专业培养干部并不代表社会主义教育制度的特点。但是，姑不论专业教育制度究竟开始于哪一国家或哪一年代，但假如这种制度能很好地为社会主义教育事业服务，又有什么理由一定要坚决反对它呢？按计划培养人才不仅需要有数字，而且还需要有类别或品种。代表这种类别或品种的就是专业。试问假如不通过按专业培养的方法，又如何准确体现按计划培养的目的呢？当然，按专业培养干部也要有一定的限制。专业分得过窄过细，不仅在分配工作时可能产生对不上口径的困难，而且对适应科学技术的发展及工作的调动也不一定有利，因此是应该适当加以防止的。关于如何根据科学技术的发展需要和我国具体情况合理设置专业的问题，因篇幅限制，在这就不多谈了。
    三、有明确的培养目标。高等工业学校是否应该有一定的培养目标，在过去一段时间内，曾在全国范围内展开了热烈的讨论。就北京地区而言，各高等工业学校的多数教师都认为高等工业学校应当有一定的培养目标，并且认为应当是工程师，虽然有少数教师还有不同的看法。我个人是赞成以工程师为高等工业学校的培养目标的。在我看来，高等工业学校应当培养工程师正像医学院应当培养医师和师范学院应当培养教师的道理一样简单，是非常容易理解的。问题很简单，高等工业学校既然负有为国家输送高级工程技术人才的任务，而这种高级工程技术人才最主要的就是工程师，那么如果高等工业学校不培养工程师，又由谁来培养呢？自然，这里的所谓工程师是作为一种“职业”而不是作为具体的“职务”或“职级”来了解的。实际上，高等工业学校应当但是只能使毕业生初步具备从事工程师工作的能力，不可能完全和有多年生产经验的工程师一样。有人提出这样做法岂不是一种形式主义吗？我认为这并不是一种形式主义，而是代表一种教学要求和教学指导思想。因为假如我们承认干部的培养应当有计划地和按专业来进行，那么问题只解答了一半。另外一半是把学生究竟培养到具有何种程度的能力的干部呢？我们必须为毕业生的水平确定一个确切的指标。对高等工业学校的正规毕业生而言，我认为这一确切的指标就是工程师。确定了这一指标之后，我们就可根据对工程师工作能力的要求，来安排教学计划和教学内容。这样就可使大家对教学工作的目的和要求有统一的认识。工程师是要能够应用理论知识来解决实际问题的，确定培养目标是工程师，因而也就随之建立了理论联系实际的教学指导思想，这对工程教育来说，是丝毫不容怀疑的。我希望我在此地提出的理论联系实际的教学指导思想，不致被人误解成为主张在教学内容中应灌输给同学以过多的具体生产知识。关于如何正确地体现理论联系实际的教学思想将在下面谈到。
    建立正确的教学指导思想
    教育事业是为国家培养人才的。因此，建立正确的教学指导思想就成为绝对必要。作为社会主义工业教育的教学指导思想，我认为至少应当包括以下几方面：
    一、全面发展；
    二、技术与政治和经济相结合；
    三、理论联系实际。
    作为新中国的工程师，他必须是智、德、体都得到平衡发展的，他必须具有为社会主义社会服务的人生观。为了满足这方面的要求，全面发展和技术与政治相结合的教学指导思想将起很大作用。理论联系实际代表着唯物主义的思想方法，是人们处理任何事务的正确思想准则，它对工程技术教育而言，更具有非常重要意义。有人说：工程技术教育从来就是理论联系实际的。但是我认为只是在教学改革以后，我们才特别强调并且真正做到有意识地根据这一教学原则来进行教学工作的，并且只是在教学改革以后，通过教学计划的制定，这一原则才具体得到贯彻。在现行各工科专业的教学计划中，在教学内容方面，有一般基础理论课程，有技术基础课程又有专业或专门化课程。在教学方式方面，有课堂演讲，有习题课，有实验课，有课程设计，有教学和生产实习，最后有结业工作或毕业设计。这样的安排清楚地反映了由一般到特殊，由理论到实际的循序渐进逐步上升的教学原则。通过一系列这样的教学环节，我们把一个对生产陌生的高中毕业生转变成为初步掌握生产的工程师。在这复杂艰巨的培养过程中，理论联系实际的教学思想，起了巨大的指导作用。
    顺便谈谈另外一个问题。自从去年中央提出向科学进军的口号以后，在全国教育和学术界中有一种重视理论，轻视实际的倾向。在这一倾向的影响下，在教学计划的修订过程中，有人提出了要大力加强基础课和裁并或尽量削减专业课的主张。少数工厂中的工程师和学校的教师也因此不安于位，而一心向往科学院。受影响最大的是大学生。这种倾向使他们对专业课、生产实习和毕业设计等的作用产生了错误的认识。部分同学甚至提出了不学专业课，不愿参加生产实习和不做毕业设计的要求。很多本届毕业生在填写工作志愿时，表示不愿到工矿工作。我认为这种倾向是不健康的。诚然，为了发展科学研究，强调提高国家的学术理论水平是必要的。但在强调理论的重要性的同时，决不应贬低实际的重要性。理论与实际的辩证关系必须被确认。不然，则有在学术和教学工作中造成理论脱离实际的危险。这对改进教学、发展科学及发展生产都是不利的。这是值得我们特别注意的问题。
    怎样对待想取消或尽量削减专业课的问题呢？有人说，教学改革后的教学质量很糟糕（关于这一问题下面要讨论），原因是专业课学得太多了，因此应当取消或尽量予以削减。首先应当指出，专业课在培养工程师的过程中是起着重大的作用的。专业课并不像有人所指责的那样都是些经验性的东西，具体琐碎的知识，没有理论之可言。在我看来，凡是从生产实践中系统地总结出来的规律，对生产的进一步发展起着指导作用的就是理论，而这种理论不一定要用数学来表示的。应当肯定数理化等基础课程对培养工程师的重大作用。我们完全有理由要求把它们学得更好些，但不学好足够份量的专业课，恐怕担任实际工作时连问题都提不出，想作一个称职的工程师是不可能的。专业课不仅可以巩固基础理论知识，而且对培养同学理论联系实际的思想方法和工作能力有很大作用。专业课是否可到工作岗位后再学呢？实际上，在学过一定基础和专业课程之后，再在工作岗位上根据工作需要，回来进一步提高基础理论，可以使理论学习更富有目的性，容易收事半功倍之效。这种认识上的辩证过程是完全合理的。又现在有很多解放前毕业的工程技术人员到高等学校听专业课。也有学校专门派教师到工矿讲授专业课的。专业课的作用和它的必要性，由此可以得到充分证明。
    培养干部质量有显著提高
    教学改革后培养出来的干部质量究竟如何呢？我认为即使在教学改革过程中培养出来的学生，在质量上总的和平均来说，比解放前也有显著的提高，这主要表现在处理实际工作的能力方面。清华大学连续几年请来学校主持毕业设计答辩的工程师，在这一点上，也发表过同样的意见。根据毕业设计的质量，很多同学的工作能力被认为已达到起码工程师的水平。在处理生产问题上，现在已经在工作岗位上的毕业生也有较好的表现。例如1955年清华大学机械制造专业的毕业生，现在有的已担任工具设计组长和计量室主任等职务，工作上是称职的。有一位被分配到抚顺重型机器厂装配车间的同学，因改进手工操作的电钻成为半自动化，把生产率提高了二十七倍。五年制的学生，即使还没毕业就在生产实习中提出了有价值的合理化建议。例如去年到长春汽车厂实习的二位铸工专业的学生，提出了一种自动落砂装置的设计，得到该厂苏联专家的赞许，已被采纳制出并应用到生产线上。专家并且说：“他要把设计图样带回苏联去”。这样的例子还可举出许多。这些都说明现在的大学毕业生是具备一定的解决生产实际问题的独立工作能力的。
    有人提到现在的大学毕业生基础太差，虽然能够解决目前的生产问题，但不能从事开创性或科学研究工作。首先，应当指出这样的事实，就是到去年为止，分发到产业部门的大学毕业生，几乎都是教学改革后毕业的首批专修科或三、四年制的学生。这些学生的基础课有的是在教学改革以前学的，有的在低年级时正值抗美援朝、三反、五反等政治和社会活动较多的时期。加以教学改革后不久，教师水平跟不上。因此，这些同学在基础方面的训练是稍差些。至于正规五年制的大学毕业生，除哈尔滨工业大学外，今年夏季也只有清华大学才有第一批。可以做这样的估计：今后正规的大学毕业生的基础训练会比前期好些。此外，对于一般初离校门的即使是正规制的大学毕业生，究竟应如何要求，也还是值得商榷的问题。我认为，对于正规大学毕业生，除了要求他们一般地能解决为中等技术学校毕业生所不能解决的比较复杂的当前生产问题，和在一定程度上进行技术革新（如技术改造）工作外，只能对其中比较优秀的少数，也可适当要求从事局部性的比较简单的科学研究工作。对一般大学毕业生普遍要求能从事开创性或科学研究工作，我认为是偏高了些。自然，为了增添国家科学研究的新生力量，高等工业学校也有责任和中国科学院及其他科学研究机构一起为培养这种更高水平的工程技术人才而努力，这是毫无疑问的。去年开始招考的四年制研究生，就是这种努力的开端。但任何想把二步并成一步走的想法，对一般大学毕业生提出过高的要求，我认为是不现实的。
    教学改革的缺点和错误
    教学改革诚然有很大的成绩，但也有不小的缺点或错误，值得检查纠正以改进今后的工作。首先，过分强调客观要求，追求数量有余，重视质量不足，是最大缺点之一。自从教学改革以来，几乎全国的高等学校都在教学工作上感到很被动。为了满足国家对干部的需要，教师们是愿意贡献自己的力量的。但是片面地强调客观需要，不很好考虑主观条件，向高等学校布置了超过实际需要很多的任务，造成了人力物力的很大浪费，影响了教学质量，很多教师都对此有意见。去年招生过多是最好的例子。对于这些比较严重的错误，应当引起所有有关部门的注意。其次，在学习苏联的问题上，应当说大家的认识是比较一致的。但对中国具体情况考虑不够，硬搬苏联经验，很多地方造成了形式主义的趋向，对教学工作也造成了很大损失。例如在推行教学计划，教学大纲，和其他教学法工作上就有很多这样的例子。在制定教学计划时特别是在教学改革初期，想要“五年计划，四年完成”，同时又未很好考虑中国教师和学生的水平，结果造成了严重的超学时现象。在考试及记分办法上，在教师工作量制度上，很多教师也都认为有教条主义或形式主义趋向。在学习外文问题上，在没有足够的俄文教师以前，未能很好发挥其他外文教师的潜力，也影响了某些学校毕业生外文的水平。再次，当贯彻一项新的教学措施时，有强求一致、机械统一的情形。例如各校入学学生程度不齐，但教学计划和教学大纲的要求是一样的。此外，从全国范围来看，过去一段时期，教学方法工作也普遍有偏多的情况，这在一定程度上也影响了教学质量的提高。大学毕业生中外文程度不如过去，确是值得特别注意的问题。
    以上缺点和错误，在过去一年修订教学计划讨论的过程中，均已被提出。很多教师对这些缺点和错误提出了尖锐的批评。有些正确意见，例如：全面加强基础（包括科学基础，技术基础及专业基础），减少周学时数，增加课外时间（特别对科学基础课），加强试验课，增设选修课等等，均已被接受并体现在新的教学计划中。可是问题的讨论，还不彻底。特别是有的报纸，例如光明日报，对教学讨论的报道有失真及偏向之处，以致在全国教师中产生了错觉。为了明确高等工业教育的方向，更好地为祖国培养合乎一定标准的工程师，我认为重新展开教学讨论是会有好处的。
    总之，教学改革肯定是成功的，当然也有很多缺点需要加以改进和克服。教学改革之所以成功，是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。因此，任何企图让共产党退出高等学校和削弱党的领导的想法，都是绝对错误的，不可能的。不过为了改进高等学校的工作，克服宗派主义、官僚主义和教条主义的危害性，如何在现行党委负责制的基础上更多地发挥各方面的积极因素，尽量发挥有经验教师的作用，本着发扬民主的精神来办好高等学校，是值得进一步审慎研究的问题。
