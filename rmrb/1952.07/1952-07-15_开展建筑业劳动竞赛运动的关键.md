    The Key to Launching a Labor Emulation Drive in the Construction Industry

    With the imminent arrival of a period of large-scale economic construction in our country, basic construction work is being elevated to a position of paramount importance. However, we currently lack experience in basic construction, especially in advanced methods for increasing labor efficiency. This situation must be changed.

    Su Changyou's team, a standard-bearer for the national construction industry, recently initiated a friendly competition with construction worker brothers nationwide. Many teams in Northeast and North China have also actively responded to Su Changyou's team. This competition will have significant implications for promoting basic construction work. To successfully launch this competition movement, it is necessary to earnestly promote and improve Su Changyou's team's advanced experience. Currently, in promoting Su Changyou's team's advanced experience, a primary ideological obstacle is the viewpoint of departmentalism.

    In less than a year, Su Changyou's team has implemented significant reforms in the construction industry, transforming the original individual, backward labor organization into a collective, rational labor organization, increasing production efficiency several times over. They also adopted Fu Hongbin's advanced experience in using mortar spreading tools and learned the Soviet Union's advanced experience in the two-handed mortar squeezing method, further increasing their production efficiency several times over. Now, they have a relatively complete set of advanced experiences. Although these experiences still need to be continuously improved, we should first and foremost encourage construction workers across the country to emulate Su Changyou's team and take basic construction work to the next level.

    Some people believe that Su Changyou's team's advanced experience is not suitable for the specific conditions within the customs (关内, i.e., regions south of the Great Wall), citing differences in wall thickness, brick size, style, etc. Therefore, they want to create another "set." In reality, the "set" they "create" is often very similar to Su Changyou's team's advanced experience, merely with a different name. This approach will only lead to two outcomes: first, a proliferation of names, creating confusion and hindering the collective strength of the masses in creating a complete set of advanced experiences; second, it will create a very negative impact among the masses, treating advanced experience as private property and leading the masses in the wrong direction. Of course, we should never dismiss the importance of promoting the creativity of the working class; on the contrary, this creativity deserves great promotion, because any advanced experience needs the collective wisdom of the masses to continuously enrich and improve it. Different specific conditions do indeed pose some difficulties for promotion work, but as long as we diligently learn from others' advanced experiences and leverage the initiative and creativity of workers, any difficulties can be overcome.

    We hope that leading cadres and advanced workers in the construction industry will work together to learn and promote Su Changyou's team's advanced experience, resolutely struggle against all departmentalist viewpoints, and ensure the smooth launch of the national competition movement in the construction industry.

    开展建筑业劳动竞赛运动的关键
    我国大规模经济建设时期即将到来，基本建设工作日益被提到头等重要的地位。但是，我们现在对于基本建设工作还缺乏经验，特别是提高劳动效率的先进经验。这种情况是必须加以改变的。
    全国建筑业的旗帜苏长有小组，最近向全国建筑工人兄弟发起友谊竞赛，东北、华北有许多小组也向苏长有小组积极应战。这个竞赛对推动基本建设工作，将具有重大意义。要顺利开展这个竞赛运动，就要认真推广和提高苏长有小组的先进经验。而目前在推广苏长有小组先进经验中，有一个主要的思想障碍，就是本位主义的观点。
    苏长有小组在不到一年的时间，在建筑业中实行了重大的改革，把原来个体的、落后的劳动组织，改变成集体的、合理的劳动组织，使生产效率提高了数倍。他们又接受了傅鸿宾运用铺灰工具的先进经验，同时学习了苏联的双手挤浆法的先进经验，他们的生产效率又提高了数倍。现在他们已有了一套比较完整的先进经验。这些经验，虽然还需要继续提高，但是我们今天首先应该让全国建筑工人都向苏长有小组看齐，把基本建设工作提高一步。
    有些人认为苏长有小组的先进经验不适合于关内的具体情况，他们说什么东北的墙厚，砖小，样式不同等等。于是他们要另外创造一套。其实他们所
    “创造”出来的“一套”，往往和苏长有小组的先进经验大同小异，只不过是另立了一种名目而已。这样的做法，只会造成两种结果：一是名目繁多，莫衷一是，不能用群众集体的力量创造出一套完整的先进经验；二是在群众中造成了极坏的影响，把先进经验当成了私有财产，把群众引到错误的方向去。当然，我们决不应当抹杀发扬工人阶级创造精神的重要性，相反的，这种创造性值得大大发扬，因为任何先进经验都需要群众的集体智慧来不断加以充实和提高。具体条件的不同，的确也会使推广工作遭受一定的困难，但是，只要好好学习别人的先进经验，发挥工人的积极性创造性，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    我们希望建筑业的领导干部和先进工人们一致努力学习与推广苏长有小组的先进经验，向一切本位主义的观点作坚决的斗争，使建筑业的全国性竞赛运动顺利开展起来。
