Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops in Tibet, acting as the Lhasa office of the People's Bank of China, completed its work of issuing interest-free agricultural and livestock loans in the Lhasa area in mid-June, solving the difficulties faced by local poor farmers and herdsmen due to a lack of seeds and grain.

　　In mid-May, each loan working group, together with representatives of the Lhasa Jizong government, went to various Zongs to work. The working groups formed loan working committees with the Zongben and headmen of each Zong, and with the assistance of the Zongben and headmen, held mass meetings to explain the significance of issuing loans to the masses. When many people applied for loans, the working groups conducted individual interviews with them to ensure that all loans were truly distributed to poor farmers and herdsmen. The loan working groups distributed more than 57,000 jin of highland barley loans in the area near Lhasa, providing seeds or food to more than 1,000 poor farmers and herdsmen. Some farmers also used the loans to purchase cattle, mules, horses, and repair farm tools. Poor rural handicraft workers also received production funds due to the loans. The farmers and herdsmen said: "The People's Liberation Army is delivering interest-free loans to our doorsteps. We have never seen such a good army!" They all said that Chairman Mao is their great savior, and everyone takes off their hats to show their respect when they hear someone mention Chairman Mao.

　　When carrying out loan work, the working group members also helped Tibetan farmers dig the ground and carry manure. The PLA medical personnel who went to various places with the working groups also treated farmers and herdsmen. As a result, a deep affection was established between the staff and the Tibetan people.

　　Note: Jizong is equivalent to a special district, Zong is equivalent to a county, and Zongben and headmen are all upper-class figures in Tibetan society.

    解放军进藏部队在拉萨机宗代理人民银行发放农牧贷款
    【新华社拉萨十六日电】人民解放军进藏部队某部政治部代理中国人民银行拉萨办事处在拉萨地区进行发放无利农牧贷款的工作已于六月中旬结束，使当地贫苦农民、牧民解决了缺乏种籽和粮食的困难。
    五月中旬，各贷款工作组协同拉萨机宗政府的代表分赴各宗工作。工作组与各宗宗本、头人共同组成贷款工作委员会，并在宗本、头人的协助下召开群众大会，向群众讲解发放贷款的意义。当群众中有许多人申请贷款时，工作组即向他们进行个别访问，使所有贷款真正发放到穷苦的农民、牧民手里。各贷款工作组共在拉萨附近地区发放了五万七千多斤青稞的贷款，使一千多户贫苦农民、牧民得到了种籽或口粉。有些农民还用贷款添置耕牛、骡、马和修理农具。贫苦的农村手工业者也由于贷款得到了生产资金。农民和牧民们说：解放军把无利贷款送到门上来，真是从来没有见过的好军队！他们都说毛主席是自己的大救星，一听到有人提到毛主席大家就脱帽表示敬意。
    工作组人员在进行贷款工作时，还帮助藏族农民挖地、背粪。随工作组到各地工作的解放军医务人员并给农民、牧民治病。因而工作人员和藏族人民之间建立了深厚的感情。
    按：机宗相当专区，宗相当县，宗本、头人都是藏族社会中的上层人物。
