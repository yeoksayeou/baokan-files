    Chairman Mao Cares About Water Conservancy in Our Mountainous Areas

    To the Editor:

    Lijiahe Village, Fifth District of Shexian County, Hebei Province, is a mountain village with 242 households. There is a shortage of water there, and it is very difficult for residents to get drinking water. If there is a drought, residents have to carry water from the Zhanghe River, which is eight or nine miles away from the village, to get drinking water, and it is even more difficult to use water for planting.

    The old revolutionary base area visiting group that came to Shexian County last time told Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government about the water shortage situation of the people in Shexian County. Chairman Mao cares about the lives of the people in the mountainous areas, and specially allocated 2.1 billion yuan in Renminbi to Shexian County for water conservancy construction. Our village alone received 15 million yuan, specifically for building ponds and digging wells. Everyone was very excited and full of confidence to do a good job in drought prevention and drought resistance. Labor model Xing Xuelian (female) said: "Chairman Mao cares about the lives of the people in our old revolutionary base areas, telling us to dig wells and live a good life. We never thought we would have such happiness today!" After deliberation and discussion, everyone decided to dig 11 new wells and repair 28 old wells. All the women in the village, led by Xing Xuelian, participated in the work of digging wells and carrying soil (each well has a skilled technician to teach the women how to dig wells). In this way, the work of digging and repairing 39 wells was completed quickly, and it did not delay the village's sowing work.

    毛主席关心我们山区的水利
    编辑同志：河北涉县五区李家河村，是二百四十二户的山庄，那里缺水，居民吃水很困难。要是天旱，居民吃水都得到离村八九里地的漳河去驮水，用水点种就更困难了。
    上次到涉县来的老区访问团，把涉县人民缺水的情况告诉了毛主席和中央人民政府。毛主席关心山区人民生活，特地给涉县拨来二十一亿元人民币兴修水利，只本村就分到一千五百万元，专供修池打井用。大家都十分兴奋，满怀信心地要把防旱抗旱工作做好。劳动模范邢学莲（女）说：“毛主席关心咱们老区人民生活，叫咱打井，叫咱过好光景。咱一辈子也想不到有今天的幸福啊！”经过酝酿讨论，大家决定打新井十一眼，修旧井二十八眼。全村妇女在邢学莲带领下，都参加了挖井担土工作（每个井都有技术能手，教妇女挖井办法）。这样，打井修井三十九眼的工作，很快就完成了，而且也没有误了全村播种工作。    石如    润田
