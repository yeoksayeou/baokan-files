The Yuqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linkou County, Songjiang Province, was established in February this year under the direct leadership of the Linkou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The cooperative has a total of thirty-two households, thirty male laborers, eleven female laborers, fourteen horses, sixteen cattle, seven improved farm tools, and one hundred thirty hectares of cultivated land (each hectare equals fifteen mu). Since its establishment, the cooperative has achieved great success in production by conducting political and ideological education among its members and implementing a quota management system. Of the cooperative's 130 hectares of land, all except 14 hectares of paddy fields that could not be fertilized due to being across the river (but the soil has been improved with silt) have been applied with base fertilizer. The area exceeds last year's by 69 percent. This year, the cooperative fundamentally changed the past practice of not plowing stubble, not raking stubble, and not collecting stalks; deep plowing is one to one and a half inches deeper than in previous years. Wheat was planted ten days earlier than last year. The investment per unit area has greatly increased compared to previous years. The capital invested per hectare in fertilization, deep plowing and careful cultivation during the spring plowing stage averaged 145,000 yuan more than last year.

    I. Political Ideological Education Work

This agricultural production cooperative is composed of a small natural village. The ideological awareness of the members varies, and their motives for joining the cooperative are also different. Some joined voluntarily because they truly recognized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives; some joined with a "wait and see" attitude; and a few joined reluctantly because they saw that everyone else was participating and were afraid of looking bad if they didn't. After joining, those with higher awareness were more active in production; those with lower awareness were less active in production and did not care about public property. The cooperative's leadership, in light of the members' ideological situation, paid attention to ideological education in practical work to improve the members' level of awareness.

    (1) Timely summarize production achievements and educate members with the facts of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. The cooperative conducted detailed summaries after each stage of production tasks, especially summaries of production achievements. For example, at the end of spring plowing, the cooperative's leading cadres first summarized the achievements of spring plowing production: nearly 90 percent of the cooperative's cultivated land was applied with base fertilizer, 70 percent of the cultivated land was applied with fine fertilizer, stubble was plowed, stalks were raked, and appropriate crops were planted. After summarizing the production achievements, the members were called upon to "look at the present and think about the past" and engage in discussions. All the members truly recognized the benefits of the production cooperative and generally reflected: "The cooperative has great strength. Individual farmers would be exhausted and still not be able to do these tasks. Mutual aid teams would also find it difficult to accomplish." Therefore, everyone truly recognized the superiority of the production cooperative.

    (2) Launch patriotic production increase campaigns to enhance the members' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production. The cooperative's members engaged in patriotic production increase competitions with production cooperatives such as Li Shunda in Shanxi and Han En in Jilin, as well as many mutual aid teams in the province and county. Members further recognized the significance of patriotic production increase in the course of the competition. The cooperative also launched competitions between groups and individuals, and conducted evaluations and rewards at the end of each production stage (two have already been conducted). In the evaluations, members with poor work attitudes were criticized, and members who actively produced were commended.

    (3) Implement a democratic management system to strengthen the members' sense of ownership. After its establishment, the cooperative implemented democratic management, stipulated a system for the appointment and removal of cadres and various meeting systems; democratically decided on production plans; published accounting books once a month; and settled work points and accounts quarterly. After each stage of production tasks was completed, the director announced the completion of the tasks and the advantages and disadvantages of the work to all the members, and listened to the members' criticisms and questions. After the implementation of the democratic system, the members all said: "The cooperative is like our own big family. Whether it is done well or badly is inseparable from our efforts." Everyone actively tried to find ways to run the cooperative well.

    (4) Democratically formulate labor discipline, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the cooperative, and strengthen the members' collective concept. When the cooperative was first established, some members were lazy, absent from work, and did not care about the cooperative's public property. At that time, only the director of the production cooperative cared about this situation and criticized it. Other members held a liberal attitude. In light of this phenomenon, the leadership mobilized all the members to formulate labor discipline: prioritizing the collective over the individual, caring for public property, asking for leave when necessary, obeying leadership, actively laboring, etc. After the discipline was stipulated, the members developed the habit of mutual supervision, criticism and self-criticism. Then, a system of holding a life review meeting every seven days was established. Various bad tendencies were gradually overcome, and a new awareness of abiding by the system, caring for public property, and actively laboring began to grow.

    II. Implementation of Quota Management

At the beginning of the spring plowing stage, the cooperative implemented a method of organizing labor by street, with the cooperative uniformly allocating and using labor. This method kept the cooperative's leading cadres busy all day planning and allocating labor, leaving them no time to comprehensively consider the cooperative's work plan; at the same time, due to the lack of production plans, the allocation of labor often resulted in ineffective command and a failure to attend to everything. When there were few tasks and many laborers, everyone rushed in, creating a waste of labor; when there were few laborers and many tasks, the labor could not be allocated. At this time, the division of labor was not fixed, and each member did not know in advance what work they would do each day, which caused a serious waste of labor. According to statistics, during the eleven days of wheat planting alone, the cooperative wasted 113 man-days and horse-days, accounting for about one-seventh of the total number of workdays at that time. At the same time, each member's work changed frequently, and no one was responsible for each task. Therefore, it was difficult for the cooperative's leadership to check the labor attitude and labor efficiency of each member, and it was difficult to implement labor discipline.

    (1) How to implement quota management

In order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve labor efficiency, the cooperative, after several days of discussion and deliberation, preliminarily determined a quota and responsibility system with fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed output. The specific methods are as follows:

    1. Change the labor organization. In order to correctly implement the quota management system, the original production organization within the cooperative was first changed. According to the strength of the labor force and the level of technology, the entire labor force of the cooperative was divided into two production groups. The labor in each group was divided according to individual technical strengths. Carts, horses, and tools were distributed to each production group according to the number of laborers in each group, the strength of each group, and the needs of agricultural work in each production season, and the groups were responsible for using and managing them. The labor in the group was allocated by the group leader, and the cooperative's leading cadres participated in the two groups respectively to help the group leaders with daily leadership. Work belonging to the entire cooperative was temporarily allocated by the cooperative's management committee according to the needs and the labor situation of each group.

    2. Divide the cultivated areas. After the production groups were reorganized, the entire cultivated land was divided into two cultivated areas and assigned to the two production groups for cultivation according to the number of laborers in each group, the strength of each group, the level of technology, the efficiency of carts, horses, and farm tools, the types of crops, the area and location of the land, and the needs of agricultural work in each production season. Each cultivated area determines the annual output, and the responsible group is contracted to operate. The output standards for various crops are based on the original soil fertility, this year's land investment, and the requirements for improving technology. At the end of the fall summary, 40 percent of the excess output is awarded to the group responsible for cultivation, 40 percent is distributed to all members as dividends, and 20 percent is used as the cooperative's public accumulation fund. Criticism will be given for failure to complete the plan.

    (2) What are the benefits of implementing quota management

After the implementation of quota management, a new atmosphere appeared in the cooperative, specifically manifested in the following aspects:

    1. The leadership of the cooperative has been strengthened. At this time, the cooperative's leading cadres have been freed from the daily task of allocating labor, personally participating in production, and providing specific guidance to the business of each group. The group leaders have also changed their attitude of relying on the director, using their own mouths and brains to allocate the labor within the group and encouraging group members to actively labor. This overcomes the past phenomenon of no one being in charge of affairs and no one being responsible, and enhances the determination of the members to run the cooperative well.

    2. The members' sense of responsibility has been strengthened. In the past, no one was responsible for whether the work was done well or badly. Now, the quality of each group's work is directly related to the interests of each member. Therefore, each group can criticize members who are not actively laboring and who do not abide by labor discipline at any time. In the past, no one was in charge of public property, but now someone is responsible for using and repairing it.

    3. Labor enthusiasm has been improved. After the quota for each task was determined, the daily work points of each member were evaluated according to the quota standard. This played a great role in stimulating labor enthusiasm. Before the implementation of quota management, some members were often late and always wanted to rest more when they arrived at the field. After the implementation of quota management, each group went to the field early every day, and no one wanted to rest first when working. The labor efficiency of each group has greatly improved. Taking sowing as an example: each of the cooperative's ten plows now sows an average of more than two mu of land per day than before the implementation of quotas. All the fields were sown in twelve days, saving 180 man-days and horse-days, and improving the quality of sowing.

    4. The content of the competition has been enriched. Before the implementation of quota management, competitions between individuals were only conducted under relatively abstract conditions such as caring for public property, abiding by labor discipline, improving awareness, and improving labor enthusiasm. In addition, each person's work changed frequently, making it difficult to check and evaluate, so the role of the competition was not significant. After regrouping and implementing quota management, the content of the competition is richer and more specific than before.

    松江省林口县余庆农业生产合作社的政治思想教育工作和定额管理制度
    段玉祥  阎竞雄  张春仁  仲彦恒
    松江省林口县余庆农业生产合作社是今年二月在中共林口县委员会直接领导下建立起来的。全社共有三十二户，男劳力三十个，女劳力十一个，马十四匹，牛十六头，改良农具七台，耕地一百三十垧
    （每垧合十五市亩）。这个社建社以来，由于对社员进行了政治思想教育，实施了定额管理制度，在生产上，已取得了很大成绩。全社一百三十垧土地，今年除十四垧谷地因隔河无法送粪（但已用淤泥改良了土壤）外，其余都施了底肥。其面积超过去年百分之六十九。今年全社根本改变了历年不刨茬子、不搂茬子，不收秸棵的习惯；深耕比往年深一寸到一寸半。麦子比去年早种了十天。在单位面积上的投资，比往年大大增多了。每垧地在春耕阶段施肥和深耕细作等方面投放的资本，平均比去年多十四万五千元。
     一、政治思想教育工作
    这个农业生产合作社是由一个小自然屯组成的。社员的思想觉悟程度各不相同，入社动机也不相同。有的人是真正认识了农业生产合作社的优越性而自愿参加的；有的人是抱着“试试看”的态度参加的；有少数人是看见大家都参加了，怕自己不参加不好看，勉强参加了的。入社以后，觉悟较高的人生产积极；觉悟较差的人生产不够积极，也不关心公有财产。社的领导方面针对着社员的思想情况，在实际工作中注意了思想教育工作，以便提高社员的觉悟水平。
    （一）及时总结生产成绩，用农业生产合作社的优越性的事实教育社员。这个社在每段生产任务完成后，都进行了详细总结，特别是生产成绩的总结。例如，在春耕结束时，社的领导干部首先总结了春耕生产的成绩：全社耕地近百分之九十施了基肥、百分之七十的耕地施了细肥、刨了茬子、搂了秸棵，种植了适当的作物。总结了生产成绩以后，号召社员“看现在想过去”，展开讨论。全体社员真正认识了生产合作社的好处，普遍反映：“合作社力量就是大，单干户累死也干不出这些活，互助组也不容易办到。”因此，大家真正认识了生产合作社的优越性。
    （二）开展爱国增产竞赛运动，提高社员的爱国增产热情。这个社的社员向山西李顺达、吉林韩恩等生产合作社和本省、本县的许多互助组进行了爱国增产竞赛。社员在竞赛过程中进一步认识了爱国增产的意义。这个社的组与组、人与人之间也提出了竞赛，并在每一生产阶段结束时，进行了评比奖励（已进行了两次）。在评比中，劳动态度不好的社员受到了批评，积极生产的社员受到了表扬。
    （三）贯彻民主管理制度，加强社员的主人翁的感觉。这个社成立以后，就实行了民主管理，规定了干部任免制度和各种会议制度；民主议定生产计划；每月公布一次会计账目；按季清工结账。每段生产任务完成之后，主任向全体社员宣布任务完成情况和工作中的优缺点，听取社员的批评和质问。实行了民主制度以后，社员都说：“合作社就好像自己的大家庭，搞好搞坏和自己努力不努力是分不开的。”大家都是积极想办法把社办好。
    （四）民主制订劳动纪律，开展社内的批评与自我批评，加强了社员的集体观念。这个社刚建立时，有些社员偷懒、旷工、不爱护社内公共财产。当时只有生产合作社主任关心这种情形，并对这种情形进行过批评，其他社员都抱着自由主义的态度。根据这种现象，领导方面发动全体社员制订了劳动纪律：先社后己，爱护公物，有事请假，服从领导，积极劳动等等。规定了纪律以后，社员有了相互督促、批评与自我批评的习惯。接着又建立了每七天召开一次生活检讨会的制度。各种不良倾向逐渐克服，遵守制度，爱护公物，积极劳动的新意识开始成长。
    二、实施定额管理
    在春耕开始阶段，这个社实行按街道编组，由社统一调配和使用劳动力的方法。这种办法，使社的领导干部成天忙于筹划和支配劳力，无暇通盘考虑全社的工作计划；同时，由于缺乏生产计划，对劳力支配经常发生指挥不灵、顾此失彼的现象。活计少劳力多时，大家一拥而上，造成窝工现象；劳力少活计多时，劳力又调配不开。这时的分工是不固定的，每个社员事先都不知道自己每天要做什么工作，这就造成了严重的窝工现象。据统计，仅在十一天的种麦工作中，全社就浪费了一百一十三个人工和马工，约占当时出工总数的七分之一。同时，每个社员的工作经常变动，各项工作无专人负责，因此，社的领导方面对每个社员的劳动态度和劳动效率很难进行检查，劳动纪律很难贯彻。
     （一）怎样实行定额管理
    为了克服上述缺点，提高劳动效率，这个社经过几天的讨论酝酿，初步确定了定量、定质、定时和定产的定额专责制度。其具体办法如下：
    1、改变劳动组织。为了正确地推行定额管理制度，首先改变了社内原有的生产组织，根据劳动力的强弱和技术的高低，把全社劳动力分成两个生产组。各组内的劳力，按个人技术特长实行分工。车马工具按各组劳力多寡和各个生产季节农事的需要，分给各生产组，由小组负责使用和保管。组内劳力由小组长负责调动，社的领导干部分别参加两个小组，帮助小组长进行日常领导。属于全社的工作，由社的管理委员会根据需要和各组劳力情况，临时调动人力。
    2、划分耕作区。生产组重新改组后，根据各组劳力多少、强弱程度、技术水平、车马农具的效能、各种作物种类、土地面积及位置和各个生产季节农事的需要，把全部耕地划分为两个耕作区，分给两个生产组耕种。各耕作区确定全年的产量，由负责的小组包干经营。各种作物的产量标准，是根据原来的地力情况、今年土地投资情况和提高技术的要求而规定的。秋后总结时，超过规定产量的，以其超过部分的百分之四十奖励负责耕种的组，百分之四十由全体社员分红，百分之二十作为社的公积金。未完成计划的给予批评。
     （二）实行定额管理有那些好处
    实行定额管理后，社内出现了新的气象，具体表现在这几方面：
    1、社的领导加强了。这时社的领导干部已从整日支配劳动力的事务中抽出身来，亲自参加生产，具体指导各组的业务。各组长也改变了依靠主任的态度，自己动口动脑，支配组内的劳力，鼓励组员积极劳动。这就克服了过去事无人管、人无专责的现象，增强了社员一定要把社办好的决心。
    2、加强了社员的责任感。过去工作干的好坏，没有专人负责。现在各组工作的好坏，直接关系着每个社员的利益。因此，各组对不积极劳动和不遵守劳动纪律的社员，都能随时提出批评。过去公物无人保管，现在有人负责使用和修理了。
    3、提高了劳动积极性。确定各项工作的定额后，每个社员每日的劳动工分，都是按定额标准来评定的。这对刺激劳动积极性起了很大作用。实行定额管理前，有些社员常常迟到，到了地里总想多休息。实行定额管理后，各组每天都是早下地，干活时谁也不愿意先休息。各组的劳动效率大大提高了。仅以播种为例：全社十付犁，每付犁每天平均都较实行定额前多种二亩多地。全部大田在十二天播种完毕，节省人工和马工一百八十个，并提高了播种质量。
    4、丰富了竞赛内容。实行定额管理前，个人和个人的竞赛，都只是在爱护公物，遵守劳动纪律，提高觉悟，提高劳动积极性等较抽象的条件下进行的，加上各人的工作经常变动，不易检查评比，因此竞赛的作用不大。重新分组和实行定额管理以后，竞赛内容比以前丰富具体了。
