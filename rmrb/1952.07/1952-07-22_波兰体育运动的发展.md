The Development of Sports in Poland

    Since the liberation of Poland eight years ago, on the basis of tremendous economic and cultural development, the people's sports have also achieved great development and success.

    The Polish United Workers' Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the development of sports. Polish United Workers' Party Chairman Beirut once said: "It is now more necessary than ever to conduct physical education for workers and youth and to widely develop sports activities. It is essential that the Party pay more attention and concern to sports."

    The work of promoting sports has now become one of the important tasks of the Polish Youth League, trade unions at all levels, and farmers' associations. Many grassroots sports organizations have been established in various factories, enterprises, and rural areas. The army and schools also have their own sports organizations, namely the "Guard" Sports Association and the Student Sports Association.

    The Polish trade union has eight major sports organizations. They are "Railway Workers," "Miners," "Textile Workers," "Steel," "Builders," "Ring," "Unia," and "Solidarity." They regularly conduct various sports activities among three and a half million workers.

    The "Railway Workers" Sports Association is one of the most prestigious and largest sports organizations. It regularly organizes 360,000 railway workers to participate in sports. The association has four sports schools and more than 2,000 sports instructors. In 1949, the association spent more than 30 million zlotys (Polish currency) on sports.

    In rural areas, sports have also become a favorite activity for the vast number of farmers. At present, nearly 7,000 various sports organizations have been established in rural Poland, and hundreds of thousands of farmers regularly participate in sports activities. The cross-country races, sports festivals, and competitions held in rural areas every year have played a great role in developing rural sports. Excellent athletes in rural areas have been able to successfully compete with famous athletes in cities in sports competitions. For example, rural athlete Franciszek Piroż won the Polish lightweight wrestling championship, and rural track and field athlete Kisiah set a Polish national record in the 100-meter sprint with a time of 10.5 seconds.

    The Student Sports Association now has 30,000 members, but its activities are carried out among a larger number of students. In universities and vocational schools, sports have become a mass activity. In schools, there are not only specialized instructors and physical education teachers, but also various complete sports facilities that were unimaginable in pre-war Poland. The large number of people who have won the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" medal is enough to illustrate the achievements of physical education in schools. In 1951, a total of 200,000 students received this medal. The number of students participating in extracurricular sports activities has now increased by two times compared to the previous year.

    The number of participants in the Polish National Sports Competition Conference is increasing year by year. In 1948, the number of participants was only 300,000, in 1949 it increased to 500,000, in 1950 it was 700,000, and in 1951 it was 750,000. In pre-war 1938, however, only 30,097 people participated in the National Competition Conference, which was only one-twenty-fifth of last year's number.

    In sports competitions, Poland's achievements in swimming, gliding, motorcycle, track and field, skiing, rowing, and fencing have been demonstrated.

    After the war, Polish swimmers renovated 21 of the 24 pre-war swimming records with their excellent results. Miner Glemrowski achieved remarkable results. His freestyle records are: 200 meters - 2 minutes 17.4 seconds; 400 meters - 4 minutes 54.3 seconds; 1,500 meters - 19 minutes 41.8 seconds.

    Polish youths are particularly interested in gliding. In this regard, the achievements of Polish athletes are worth mentioning. Last year, Polish glider pilots created ten outstanding records. Among them, female glider pilots Kompona and Vladslo broke five world gliding records.

    Football is a sport loved by the Polish people. At present, there are nearly 4,000 football teams and more than 150,000 players in Poland. Polish basketball has also made great progress in recent years. The number of national basketball teams has increased dozens of times compared to pre-war times. In Poland, winter is the season for basketball. At that time, the twelve best basketball teams in the country often hold friendly matches with each other to exchange experiences and improve their skills. Now Polish basketball players are working hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improve their skills. The achievements of the Polish basketball team in a short period of time are not small. The Polish national women's basketball team that came to our country this time defeated Italy, France, and Switzerland in the European Women's Basketball Championship held in Moscow last year and won fifth place (after the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria).

    Motorcycle racing is now very common in Poland. It attracts thousands of enthusiasts and spectators. When the motorcycle race between Poland and Czechoslovakia was held in Wrocław, there were 50,000 spectators, and when the Polish National Motorcycle Race was held, the number of spectators reached 70,000.

    In track and field, Polish athletes renovated 50 pre-war national records. In addition, in skiing, skating, rowing, boxing, and fencing, Polish athletes have also achieved many remarkable achievements. They often conduct friendly matches with athletes from various fraternal countries, participate in various international competitions, and have achieved many results.

    The Polish government allocates a large amount of funds every year to widely develop sports. In recent years, thousands of sports fields, swimming pools, ski stations, and glider clubs have been established throughout Poland. Now sports have become an indispensable part of the lives of the vast number of working people in Poland. With the continuous rise of Poland's national economy and culture, Poland's sports will surely achieve more and greater progress in the future. (Special report from this newspaper)

    波兰体育运动的发展
    波兰解放八年以来，在经济与文化的巨大发展的基础上，人民的体育事业也获得了很大的发展和成就。
    波兰统一工人党和人民政府对于发展体育事业是
    十分重视的。波兰统一工人党主席贝鲁特曾经这样
    说过：“正是现在，比过去任何时期都需要对劳动者和青年进行体育教育，广泛展开体育运动。党对体育运动更加关心和注意是很必要的。”
    推广体育运动的工作现在已成为波兰青年联盟、各级工会与农民协会的重要任务之一。在各个工厂、企业与农村中，都建立了许多基层的体育组织。在军队与学校中也有自己的体育组织，即“近卫军”体育协会和学生体育协会。
    波兰工会共有八个大体育团体。它们是“铁路工人”、“矿工”、“纺织工人”、“钢”、“建筑者”、“环”、“尤尼亚”和“团结”。它们在为数达三百五十万的工人中间经常展开各种体育活动。
    “铁路工人”体育协会是其中最有名望，人数最多的一个体育组织。它经常组织三十六万铁路工人从事体育运动。该会拥有四所体育学校和二千多名体育指导人员。一九四九年该会用在体育方面的经费达三千多万兹罗提（波币）。
    在农村中，体育也已成为广大农民所喜爱的活动。现在波兰农村中已成立了近七千个各种体育团体，经常参加体育活动的有数十万农民。每年在农村中举行的越野赛跑、体育节和竞赛会，对于发展农村体育运动起了极大的作用。农村中的优秀运动员在体育比赛会中已经能够很成功地和城市中著名的运动员们相匹敌了。例如，农村运动员弗兰崔舍克·皮洛什夺得了波兰轻量级角力赛的锦标选手称号，农村田径运动员基夏以十秒点五的时间创造了波兰百公尺短跑的全国纪录。
    学生体育协会现已拥有三万名会员，但它的活动却在更多的学生群众中进行。在大学与专科学校中，体育已成为群众性的活动。在学校里不但有专门的指导人员与体育教师，而且还有着在战前波兰所不能想像的各种完善的体育设备。获得“准备劳动与卫国”奖章的人数的众多，足以说明体育教育在学校中所得到的成就。在一九五一年，共有二十万名学生得到了这种奖章。现在参加课外体育活动的学生人数已较上一年增加了两倍。
    参加波兰全国体育比赛大会的人数，一年比一年增多。在一九四八年参加的人数只有三十万人，一九四九年增加到五十万人，一九五零年为七十万人，一九五一年为七十五万人。而在战前的一九三八年，参加全国比赛大会的却仅有三万零九十七人，只及去年人数的二十五分之一。
    在体育运动的竞赛中，显示出了波兰在游泳、滑翔、摩托车、田径、滑雪、划船与击剑等项运动方面的成就。
    波兰的游泳家们在战后以他们的优异成绩，革新了本国二十四项战前游泳纪录中的二十一项。矿工格列姆洛夫斯基获得了显著的成绩。他的自由式的纪录是：二百公尺——二分十七秒四；四百公尺——四分五十四秒三；一千五百公尺——十九分四十一秒八。
    波兰青年们对于滑翔机运动特别感到兴趣。在这方面，波兰运动员们的成绩是值得提及的。去年波兰的滑翔机员们创造了十项优异的纪录。其中女滑翔员康波娜与符拉兹罗等还打破了五项世界的滑翔纪录。
    足球是波兰人民所喜爱的运动。现在波兰全国共有近四千个足球队，十五万余球员。波兰篮球在近年来也有着很大的进展。全国篮球队的数目已较战前增加了数十倍。在波兰，冬天是盛行篮球的季节。那时全国最优秀的十二个篮球队就常常互相举行友谊比赛，交流经验和提高技术。现在波兰篮球运动员们正在努力学习苏联的先进经验，提高自己的球艺。波兰篮球队在短期内所获得的成就是不小的。这次前来我国的波兰国家女子篮球代表队，曾于去年在莫斯科举行的欧洲女子篮球锦标赛中战胜了意大利、法国与瑞士等国，而获得第五名（次于苏、捷、匈、保）。
    波兰的摩托车比赛现在是很普遍的。它吸引了成千成万的爱好者与观众。在罗克劳举行的波兰与捷克斯洛伐克的摩托车比赛时有观众五万人，而在举行波兰全国摩托车比赛时，观众则达到七万人。
    在田径方面，波兰运动员们革新了五十项战前的全国纪录。此外，在滑雪、滑冰、划船、拳击与击剑等项运动方面，波兰运动员们也获得了许多显著的成就。他们常常和各兄弟国家的运动员们进行友谊比赛，参加各种国际比赛，并得到不少的成绩。
    波兰政府为了广泛开展体育运动，每年都拨出大量的经费。近几年来，波兰全国已建立了成千成万所体育场、游泳池、滑雪站与滑翔机俱乐部。现在体育运动已成为波兰广大劳动人民生活中不可缺少的一部分了。随着波兰全国经济与文化的不断高涨，波兰的体育事业今后必将获得更多和更大的进展。（本报特稿）
