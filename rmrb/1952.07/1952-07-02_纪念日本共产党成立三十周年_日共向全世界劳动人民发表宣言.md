Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 30th: The 15th of July marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. The "Akahata" newspaper recently published the declaration of the Japanese Communist Party to the working people of the world, commemorating its 30th anniversary. The declaration is as follows:

The Japanese Communist Party is celebrating its 30th anniversary amidst the frantic persecution by the heinous American and Japanese reactionaries. After the U.S. imperialists and their running dog, the Yoshida traitorous government, single-handedly arranged the illegal separate "peace treaty," they are deceiving the Japanese people with a fake "independence," attempting to sacrifice our country to realize their plan for world domination. They are attempting to implement the Subversive Activities Prevention Law, declare the Communist Party illegal, and deprive the people of the last remaining freedom to engage in political activities and the right to hold gatherings, demonstrations, and strikes. Relying on the armed forces of the occupation, dispatching national police and police reserves using gas bombs, pistols, clubs, torture, and intimidation, they are bloodily persecuting the people who are fighting for independence and peace, persecuting workers, students, youth, and women, persecuting not only adults but also children. These atrocities and cruel methods surpass even the actions of the former imperial police.

The Japanese people have never been so abused as they are now. The American imperialists arbitrarily trample upon our land, using it as a base for launching aggression. Industry is being destroyed, and workers are groaning under the unbearable burden of low wages and accelerated work. Farmers are being cruelly driven off their already insufficient land. The number of unemployed exceeds ten million.

Workers of the world! The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people will never allow the American and Japanese reactionaries to run rampant like this. The heroic struggle during the May Day in Tokyo clearly demonstrates this determination. We know from our own experience that our enemies are paper tigers. Since then (May Day – TASS editor's note), our enemies have arrested and imprisoned more than a thousand patriots.

However, arrests and imprisonment cannot shake the Japanese people's will to fight.

The Japanese people know that the Communist Party's new program points out the only path to national liberation, and that only by fighting to realize this program can the Japanese people achieve independence and freedom, consolidate international solidarity with the working class of the world, and defend Asian peace and world peace.

The Japanese Communist Party calls on all the people of Japan to launch a broad movement to defend the Party's glorious tradition of thirty years, and to make the Party's thirtieth anniversary a festival for the people's struggle for national liberation. We sincerely believe that the working class of the world will further support and encourage our struggle against the rearmament of Japan and the aggressive policies of American imperialism.

    纪念日本共产党成立三十周年
    日共向全世界劳动人民发表宣言
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社东京六月三十日讯：七月十五日是日本共产党成立三十周年纪念日。“赤旗报”顷刊载日本共产党为纪念成立三十周年向全世界劳动人民发表的宣言。宣言如下：
    日本共产党是在万恶的美、日反动派疯狂迫害的情况下来庆祝它的成立三十周年纪念的。美帝国主义及其走狗吉田卖国政府一手包办了非法的单独“和约”以后，正在用假“独立”来欺骗日本人民，他们想牺牲我国以实现其称霸世界的计划。他们想执行防止破坏活动法案，宣布共产党非法，剥夺人民剩下的最后一点进行政治活动的自由和举行集会、示威与罢工的权利。他们仰仗占领军武装部队，派国家警察和警察后备队使用瓦斯弹、手枪、棍棒、酷刑和恫吓手段，血腥迫害争取独立与和平的人民，迫害工人、学生、青年和妇女，不但迫害成年人，而且还迫害儿童。这种暴行和残酷手段比以往帝国警察的行径有过之而无不及。
    日本人民从来没有像现在这样横受虐待。美帝国主义者恣意践踏我们的土地，把它当作发动侵略的基地。工业正在被摧毁着，工人在不堪忍受的低工资和加速工作的重担下痛苦呻吟；农民被残酷地赶出他们本来就不够的土地。失业的人数超过了一千万。
    全世界工人们！日本共产党和日本国民决不容许美、日反动派像现在这样胡作非为下去。“五一”节在东京进行的英勇斗争清楚地表明了这种决心。我们从我们亲身的经验中知道我们的敌人是纸老虎。从那时（“五一”节——塔斯社编者注）以来，我们的敌人已逮捕和囚禁了一千多个爱国者。
    但是逮捕和囚禁是动摇不了日本国民的斗争意志的。
    日本国民知道，共产党的新纲领指出了走向民族解放的唯一道路，日本国民只有为实现这一纲领而斗争，才能得到独立和自由，巩固与全世界工人阶级之间的国际团结，保卫亚洲和平与世界和平。
    日本共产党号召日本全国人民发动一个广泛的运动来保卫党的三十年的光荣传统，使党的三十周年纪念日成为人民争取民族解放的节日。我们衷心相信全世界工人阶级将进一步支持和鼓舞我们进行反对重新武装日本和美帝国主义的侵略政策的斗争。
