(I)
Since the launch of the production increase and economy drive, state-owned and publicly-owned factories and mines in Beijing have gradually attached importance to the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. Advanced experiences such as high-speed, rapid, and multi-tool cutting methods in the machinery industry, nodular cast iron and double-scale molding in the foundry industry, the Su Changyou advanced work method in basic construction, burning low-quality coal in the electric power industry, and the Ma Liuhai multi-hole circulating tunneling method in coal mines have begun to be promoted initially. At the same time, thanks to the active minds of the workers, tens of thousands of tips and tricks have emerged, presenting a new atmosphere in production. This has not only universally improved output and quality, and played a great role in formulating advanced production plans, but has also aroused the attention of factory and mine leaders to production reforms, and partially carried out production reforms. For example, the large-scale promotion of high-speed, rapid, and multi-tool cutting methods must gradually achieve product specialization; frequent changes of tasks will affect the promotion of this advanced experience.

In the process of promoting advanced experiences, the leadership has further seen the unlimited potential of enterprises, and has initially criticized the ideas of some technicians who only believe in old technical theories and do not rely on the masses, as well as the conservative ideas of workers. At the same time, they have also learned some methods for summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. These are important conditions for large-scale promotion of advanced experiences in the future.

(II)
Although Beijing has achieved initial results in promoting advanced experiences, it is still in its initial stage, so there are still many problems that need to be gradually solved.

1. The process of promoting advanced experience is a process of struggle between advanced and backward ideas. It is necessary to deeply grasp the ideological dynamics of employees, repeatedly and deeply conduct education, support the creation of the advanced, and use advanced ideas to defeat backward ideas. For example, Shao Ningjun, a worker at the Beijing Electric Power Bureau Laboratory, suggested that the laboratory establish a work-hour and material recording system to change the past chaotic use of labor and materials. However, the section chief, Xu Jintao (a Communist Party member), found it troublesome, saying, "It's not a major repair or improvement project, what's the point of recording work-hours and materials?" He did not attach importance to this reasonable suggestion. After the Party branch learned about this matter, on the one hand, it suggested that the administration approve Shao Ningjun's suggestion, and on the other hand, it helped Xu Jintao recognize his mistake at the branch general meeting and asked him to conduct a self-criticism among the masses in the laboratory. Since then, taking Xu's thinking as the representative, the mistakes of some middle-level cadres who did not pay attention to workers' tricks were criticized at mass meetings and meetings of cadres at all levels, and righteousness was established. Some workers said, "It's really effective to make good suggestions from workers, and no one can ignore them." This practice of actively criticizing and daring to fight against wrong ideas that hinder the promotion of advanced experience is correct. However, on the contrary, some factories and mines have relaxed or completely abandoned ideological leadership in the promotion of advanced experience, and passively allowed various erroneous ideas to develop. This will inevitably make it impossible to smoothly promote advanced experience. For example, Jiao Xinglin of the casting workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory created advanced operating methods in early June, which could often keep the scrap rate at 3% to 4% (at that time, the average scrap rate of the workshop was 10%), but the group leader had backward ideas, fearing that Jiao Xinglin would replace him as the group leader, so not only did he not learn himself, but also affected the whole group not to learn actively, and the scrap rate remained at more than 10%. The factory leadership took an erroneous attitude of letting things go and not intervening in this intolerable phenomenon, and did not conduct timely education (now it has been initially corrected).

However, whether various erroneous and backward ideas among the masses can be gradually eliminated depends on whether the leaders of the factories and mines truly attach importance to the promotion of advanced experience. Some factory and mine leaders hold a task-oriented view of promoting advanced experience, "Promote it if the leadership asks us to." Some separate the promotion of advanced experience from the completion of the state plan, saying, "The production task is very tight now, we will promote it later." Some are afraid that promoting advanced experience will affect quality, while others do not pay any attention to promoting advanced experience. For example, although Guanghua Textile Factory sent people to Tianjin in February this year to learn the 1951 Weaving Work Method, there is still no sign of preparation to promote this advanced experience. When the higher-level trade union goes down to assist, they still do not act actively.

2. It is necessary to have sound organizational structures, and promote advanced experiences in a planned and led manner. In terms of organizational leadership, there are currently two bad situations: one is that the party, government, trade union, and youth league responsible cadres organize a rationalization proposal committee or an advanced experience promotion committee in the whole factory, but there is no one to do the daily work, and there is no organization in the workshop and team, so that although there is an institution, it becomes an empty shell. The other is that there is someone in charge, but the working methods are not very right, so the current more common problem has arisen: the tricks or suggestions of the masses are accumulated, causing the leadership to be passive and the masses dissatisfied; some key production problems have not yet been resolved. The main reason is that when mobilizing the masses to find tricks and promote advanced experiences, they did not, according to the problems that need to be solved most urgently in the current production, give guidance and guide the masses to find tricks or promote several major advanced experiences with a goal. In addition, in dealing with tricks or suggestions, the principle of level-by-level responsibility was not implemented. For example, when the Beijing Electric Power Bureau mobilized the masses to find tricks, it did not repeatedly emphasize solving the weak link in production - the transformer oil leakage problem in the power supply department. Therefore, although more than 700 tricks appeared in the bureau, very few suggestions were made in this regard. There are also some shortcomings in the handling. For example, simple improvements to the combustion method in the boiler room (without changing equipment) can save 200 kilograms of coal per day. This kind of suggestion should have been discussed by the team, approved by the workshop, and reported to the higher level for record, but the bureau concentrated on the repeated research by the heads of the management, accounting, and other departments (of course, this spirit of attaching importance to workers' opinions is good), wasting manpower and delaying the early realization of suggestions that are conducive to production. In some factories, the suggestions and tricks of the masses are sent directly to the factory headquarters without being studied by the team and the workshop. This not only fails to concentrate the wisdom of the masses to enrich the shortcomings of the tricks, but also requires the factory headquarters to return to the workshop and team to re-investigate and study many problems. The complicated back-and-forth procedures not only waste manpower and time, and cannot solve production problems in a timely manner, but also affect the enthusiasm of the masses.

The Shijingshan Power Plant and the Tram Company Repair Shop have done a better job in this regard. According to the main problems in production at each stage, they pointed out the "trick route" or gave topics, and promoted one or two major advanced experiences in a planned way at different stages, so that the masses could use their brains with direction and the tricks could also be concentrated. For example, the Shijingshan Power Plant's experiment with low-quality coal and rapid overhaul in May and June was done in this way. At the same time, the whole factory has a rationalization proposal committee or an organization for promoting advanced experience, and technical research groups or technical research associations have also been established in teams or classes, workshops or departments. Generally, tricks or suggestions that can be solved by the team are reported to the workshop for approval, and those that can be solved by the workshop are reported to the factory for approval. Those that cannot be solved by both the workshop and the team are requested to be solved by the factory. Improvements to equipment or research funds are reported to the factory for approval, so that the tricks can be dealt with in a timely manner.

3. Promoting advanced experiences requires a series of in-depth and meticulous work. Because promoting advanced experiences first requires workers to learn advanced experiences and improve their skills in order to replace old methods. Organizing exhibitions and performances, visits, etc. are necessary, but limiting to this is far from enough. The important issue is to strengthen technical education. The existing methods are mainly to establish professional technical research associations or regular professional technical exchange meetings and open training classes. For example, the Beijing Machine Factory opened a training class on high-speed cutting methods, explaining the performance of machine tools and the use of tools, so that workers can master advanced technology in the shortest time. This method can be universally adopted. However, at present, many factories and mines still keep the work of promoting advanced experience at the level of general appeals and meetings, the preparatory work is not enough, there is a lack of inspection in the process, and technical education is not carried out in a timely manner. For example, due to the influence of tools, the Sixth Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory has not been able to universally adopt multi-tool cutting method. When the Beijing Tram Company Repair Shop promoted the high-speed cutting method, it did not conduct in-depth education on the performance of the machine tool and the principle of high-speed cutting. The apprentice Liu Yanfang actually used a high speed of 1,500 revolutions to cut screws, resulting in 99 defective products.

4. The masses should be mobilized and technicians should be organized to go to the workshops to summarize advanced experiences. The experiences summarized in this way are easily accepted by the masses. Otherwise, it will inevitably isolate the advanced and make it difficult to promote the experience. For example, the advanced experience of Jiao Xinglin, a worker in the casting workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, in making plow tips was summarized by the higher-level trade union and the Party branch committee of the factory in several individual talks with Jiao, ignoring the organization of the team workers to fully study and discuss. As a result, although the experience was summarized, there was resistance among the masses, saying, "The higher-level favors Jiao Xinglin." The leadership did not conduct timely education and explanation, so this experience has not been universally promoted. On the contrary, the woodworking workshop of the factory organized the masses to summarize the advanced experience of the carpenter Zhang Jingtong, and the masses quickly learned it universally. The average daily output of plow handles was increased from 170 to more than 200. The summarization process was like this: Zhang Jingtong's team, with the help of cadres, held a team meeting to publicly recognize advanced figures. Zhang was often the worker with the best output and quality in the team, so he was naturally recognized smoothly. Then he reported his working methods, and everyone put forward some opinions based on what they usually saw. Finally, Zhang Jingtong's experience was affirmed by the masses. Chen Puquan's continuous copper method in the first branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory could only increase output. After the team studied it, it added a method to improve quality. These two examples show that the process of mobilizing the masses for discussion is the process of repeatedly breaking through ideas, enabling the masses to learn and further enrich and develop advanced experiences. This approach is successful. On the other hand, it is necessary to pay attention to the development of advanced experiences and summarize them in a timely manner to gradually improve them. At the same time, mobilizing technicians to go to the workshops to provide technical guidance to workers is an important step and method for summarizing advanced experiences. For example, in early June, the Shijingshan Power Plant discovered that the output of Qi Yuliang, a coal grinding technician in the Jia class of the boiler workshop coal pulverizer, was 14% higher than that of ordinary people. At that time, Qi Yuliang did not feel that he had any special experience than others. Later, technicians were sent to the workshop, and after three days of practical research, it was concluded that Qi's experience was mainly to be able to grasp the temperature of the hot air inlet and outlet of the coal mill according to the different properties of the coal. After this experience was promoted, the output of the three shifts of the coal pulverizer exceeded the quota of 15 tons and created a new record of 18 tons.

At present, although the promotion of advanced experience in Beijing is only in the initial stage, due to the unbalanced development of advanced experience between various types of work, processes, and departments, some phenomena of incompatibility between advanced operating methods and backward labor organization and management systems have also occurred. For example, after the Beijing Tram Company Repair Shop implemented the flow-line operation method, the production efficiency was two-thirds higher than before, but because the parts in the machine shop could not be supplied in a timely manner, there were occasional stoppages. The promotion of Su Changyou's advanced work method in the construction industry has generally led to problems such as insufficient supply of raw materials, lack of rewards, and untimely rewards, which hinder the development of advanced experience. This requires us to pay close attention to strengthening the work of production reform in the production increase and economy competition movement in the future, and gradually implement advanced experiences such as flow-line operation methods, joint teams, and "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," which are decisive for production reform.

    北京市国营公营厂矿在总结和推广先进经验中存在的几个问题
    北京市总工会研究室
     （一）
    北京市各国营、公营厂矿自开展增产节约运动以来，总结和推广先进经验的工作，已逐渐引起各方面的重视。机器业中的高速、快速和多刀多刃切削法，翻砂业中的球墨铸铁、双称造模，基本建设方面的苏长有等先进工作法，电业中的烧劣质煤，煤矿中的马六孩多孔道循环掘进作业法等先进经验开始初步推行。同时，由于职工积极开动脑筋，出现了数以万计的窍门，生产上呈现出新的气象。不仅使产量、质量普遍提高，对制订先进的生产计划起了很大的作用，而且也引起了厂矿的领导上，对生产改革的重视，并部分的进行了生产改革。如大量推行高速、快速和多刀多刃切削法，必须逐渐作到产品的专业化，经常换活便会影响这一先进经验的推广。
    在推广先进经验中，也使领导上进一步看到了企业的无限潜在力量，初步批判了部分技术人员中的只相信旧的技术理论，不依靠群众的思想和工人中的保守思想等。同时，也摸到了一些总结和推广先进经验的办法。这些都是今后大规模推广先进经验的重要条件。
     （二）
    北京市推广先进经验虽然已取得初步成绩，但因为尚处在开始的阶段，因此还存在很多问题，需要逐步解决。
    1、推广先进经验的过程就是先进思想与落后思想的斗争过程，必须深入掌握职工的思想动态，反复深入地进行教育，支持先进者的创造，用先进的思想战胜落后的思想。如北京电业局试验室工人邵宁俊建议该室建立记工记料制度，改变过去用工用料的混乱现象。但股长徐金涛（共产党员）嫌麻烦，说：“又不是大的修理和改进工程，记工记料干什么？”不重视这个合理的建议。党支部知道这件事情以后，一方面建议行政批准邵宁俊的建议，一方面在支部大会上帮助徐金涛认识他的错误，并让他在试验室的群众中进行检讨。此后，即以徐的思想为代表，在群众大会和各级干部会上批判当时某些中层干部不重视工人窍门的错误，树立了正气，有的工人说：“工人提了好意见真顶事，谁不听也不行。”这种积极向阻挠先进经验推广的错误思想进行批判和敢于斗争的作法是正确的。但是，与此相反，也有部分厂矿在推广先进经验中放松或完全放弃了思想领导，消极地任各种错误思想发展。这就必然使先进经验不能顺利推广。如华北农业机械总厂铸工车间焦兴林在六月初创造了先进操作方法，经常能使废品率保持百分之三至四（当时车间平均废品率百分之十），但该组组长有落后思想，怕焦兴林顶了他的组长职位，因此不但自己不学，也影响全组没有积极学，废品率仍停留在百分之十以上。该厂领导上对这种不能容忍的现象却采取了放任不管的错误态度，没有及时进行教育（现已初步纠正）。
    但是，群众中的各种错误落后思想是否能够逐步扫除，则又决定于各厂矿领导上对推广先进经验是否真正重视。有的厂矿领导上对推广先进经验抱任务观点，“领导上叫推广就推广吧”。有的把推广先进经验和完成国家计划割裂起来，说：“现在生产任务挺紧，以后再推广。”有的怕推广先进经验影响质量，有的则对推广先进经验毫不重视，如光华纺织厂，今年二月虽曾派人到天津学习一九五一织布工作法，但至今仍无准备推广这一先进经验的动静，上级工会下去协助，还不积极行动起来。
    2、需要有健全的组织机构，有计划、有领导地推广先进经验。在组织领导方面，目前存在着两种不好的情况：一种是在全厂由党、政、工、团负责干部组织了合理化建议委员会或先进经验推广委员会，但无专人作日常工作，车间和小组又无组织，以致虽有机构，但成了个空架子。另一种是有专人负责，但工作方法不大对头，因此产生了当前较普遍存在的、积压了群众的窍门或建议，造成领导被动，群众不满；有的生产上的关键问题还没解决。其主要原因，一个是发动群众找窍门和推广先进经验时，没有根据当前生产上最需解决的问题，有领导地指出方向，引导群众有目标地找窍门或推广几种主要的先进经验。另外，在处理窍门或建议时，没有贯彻逐级负责的原则。如北京电业局在发动群众找窍门时，没有反复强调解决生产中的薄弱环节——供电部门的变压器漏油等问题，因此，该局虽出现了七百多件窍门，但这一方面的建议却提的很少。在处理上也存在一些缺点，如锅炉房简单改进燃烧方法（不用改设备）每天可省煤二百斤，这种建议本来由小组讨论车间批准，报上级备案即可，但该局却集中了管理、会计等科长反复研究
    （当然这种重视工人意见的精神是好的），浪费了人力，也拖延了有利于生产的建议不能尽早实现。有的厂子群众的建议和窍门不通过小组和车间研究就直接送到厂部，既不能集中群众的智慧，充实窍门之不足，而许多问题厂部又须回到车间和小组重新调查研究，往返手续繁杂，不但浪费人力和时间，不能及时解决生产上的问题，而且也影响群众的积极性。
    石景山发电厂、电车公司修造厂等单位在这方面作的比较好，他们根据每个阶段生产上的主要问题，指出“窍门路线”或出课题，在不同的阶段有计划的推广一两个主要的先进经验，使群众开动脑筋有方向，窍门也能集中。如石景山发电厂在五、六月份试验劣质煤和快速检修等先进经验就是这样作的。同时全厂有合理化建议委员会或推广先进经验的组织，在小组或班，车间或科室也成立了技术研究小组或技术研究会。一般的小组能解决的窍门或建议报车间批准，车间能解决的报厂批准，车间和小组都不能解决的再请厂协助解决。改进设备或需研究经费的报厂批准，这样，窍门处理的就比较及时。
    3、推广先进经验必须作一系列的深入而又细致的工作。因为推广先进经验，首先要使工人学会先进经验，提高技术，才能用以代替旧的方法。组织展览会和表演、参观等是必要的，但仅限于此就非常不够了。重要的问题还是加强技术教育。目前已有的办法主要是成立专业技术研究会或经常性的专业技术交流会和开训练班等。如北京机器厂开办了高速切削法的训练班，讲解机床性能和刀具的使用等，使工人在最短期间掌握先进的技术。这种办法是可以普遍采用的。但是，目前还有不少厂矿仍把推广先进经验的工作停留在一般性的号召和会议上，事先的准备工作不够，进行中也缺乏检查，没有及时进行技术教育。如第六汽车制配厂由于受刀具的影响，多刀多刃切削法尚不能普遍采用。北京电车公司修造厂在推广高速切削法时，未对机床性能和高速切削的原理进行深入的教育，徒工刘燕芳竟用一千五百转的高速度切削螺丝，结果出了九十九个废品。
    4、应发动群众并组织技术人员下车间总结先进经验。这样总结出来的经验，才易被群众接受。反之，必定会使先进者孤立，经验也不易推广。如华北农业机械总厂铸工车间焦兴林作犁尖的先进经验，就是上级工会和该厂党总支委员与焦进行了几次个别谈话总结出来的，忽略了组织该小组工人充分研究讨论，结果经验虽然总结出来了，但群众中有抵抗情绪，说：“上级偏爱焦兴林。”领导上又未及时进行教育和解释，因此这一经验至今也未普遍推广。与此相反，该厂木工车间组织群众总结了木工张景通的先进经验，群众很快就普遍学会了。使犁辕平均日产量由一百七十个提高到二百个以上。总结的过程是这样的：张景通的所在小组，在干部的帮助下，开小组会公认先进人物，张经常是该组产量质量最好的工人，当然就顺利地被公认了。接着他报告了他的工作方法，大伙根据平日看到的，又提了些意见，最后才把张景通的经验经群众肯定下来。华北农业机械厂第一分厂铸工陈普泉的连续化铜法仅能提高产量，小组研究后，又充实了提高质量的方法。这两件事例说明，发动群众讨论的过程，即是反复打通思想，使群众学会并进一步充实和发展先进经验的过程。这种作法是成功的。另一方面，必须注意先进经验的发展情况，及时加以总结，使之逐步提高。同时，发动技术人员下车间，对工人进行技术指导，是总结先进经验的重要步骤和方法。如石景山发电厂在六月上旬，发现锅炉车间煤粉炉甲班磨煤技工齐玉良的产量较一般人高百分之十四，而当时齐玉良并不感到自己有什么比别人特殊的经验，后来派技术人员下车间，经过三天的实际研究，才总结出齐的经验主要是能够根据煤的不同性质，掌握磨煤机热风入口和出口的温度。这个经验推广后，磨煤机三班的产量都突破了十五吨的定额并创造了十八吨的新纪录。
    目前，北京市的推广先进经验虽仅处在初步阶段，但由于各工种、工序和各部门之间的先进经验发展的不平衡，也部分地产生了先进操作方法与落后的劳动组织和管理制度不相协调的现象。如北京电车公司修造厂实行流水作业法以后，生产效率较前提高了三分之二，但因为机工车间的零件不能及时供应，就时有停工现象。建筑业推广苏长有等的先进工作法，普遍发生了原材料供应不上、缺乏奖励和奖励不及时等问题，妨害了先进经验的发展。这就要求我们今后在增产节约竞赛运动中十分注意加强生产改革工作，逐步实行流水作业法、联合小组以及对生产改革具有决定性意义的“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”等先进经验。
