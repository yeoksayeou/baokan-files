The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in order to implement the resolution of "Increase Production and Practice Economy" and improve the quality of all cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics, and to eliminate the wasteful work procedures and packaging trademarks left over from the old society, after discussion and research at the National Textile and Dyeing Technical Measures Economy Conference, has passed suggestions on the sizing rate of cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics and simplified decoration methods. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has made a decision on this and issued a notice for nationwide implementation. The main points of the decision are as follows:

(1) The sizing rates for cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics are specified as follows:

	A. Cotton cloth sizing: According to the current national situation, light sizing shall be implemented uniformly, with 14% as the national average advanced sizing rate. Public and private textile mills, weaving mills, and dyeing mills in various regions should actively promote and implement existing advanced light sizing methods. From October 1, 1952, public and private textile mills, weaving mills, and dyeing mills in various regions must reduce the original sizing rate to below 14%. After this date, cotton cloth produced, except for existing heavy-sized cloth, will be treated as a violation of regulations if heavy sizing is found.

	B. Printed and dyed fabrics: From August 1, 1952, all public and private printing and dyeing factories and dyeing mills in all regions of the country shall eliminate the sizing process for all printed fabrics, colored fabrics, and bleached fabrics. After this date, except for existing sized printed and dyed fabrics, any sizing found will be treated as a "violation of economic laws."

	C. For cotton cloth with heavy sizing and printed and dyed fabrics that must be sized due to special needs and industrial use in various regions, the names, specifications, and uses should be submitted to the Central Textile Industry Department and relevant departments for review and approval before July 1952.

(2) All original prints, trademarks, and paper labels on cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics shall be abolished from August 1, 1952. Public and private textile mills, printing and dyeing factories, weaving mills, and dyeing mills in all regions of the country shall implement the following measures:

	A. In the future, each piece of cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabric shall uniformly use a printed trademark, and a stamp shall be added to both ends of the cloth. The content of the trademark shall include the name of the manufacturer, the name of the trademark, the manufacturing specifications, the finished product specifications, and the quality grade. The content of the stamp shall include the name of the manufacturer, the manufacturing date, and the mark of the person responsible for leaving the factory.

	B. The size of the trademark shall be uniformly specified as 7.5 cm in height and 15 cm in width. The size of the stamp shall be uniformly specified as 5 cm in height and 20 cm in width.

	C. The trademark printing position should be within 2.5 cm from the edge of the cloth and within 50 cm from the head of the cloth. The stamp should be affixed within 8 cm of both ends of the fabric.

	D. The pigments used for printing should be easily washed off and not bleed.

	E. Except for those specified in item A and those approved by government testing, the trademark printing content shall not include deceptive words such as "Never Fade" or "Guaranteed Not to Fade".

	F. From August 1, 1952, except for old stock fabrics, the act of affixing the original trademark paper or trademark print will be treated as a violation of regulations.

(3) The following provisions for simplifying the packaging of cotton cloth and printed and dyed fabrics shall be implemented by public and private textile mills, printing and dyeing factories, dyeing mills, and weaving mills nationwide from August 1, 1952.

	A. All cloth bundles shall uniformly use high-quality hemp rope instead of iron hoops.

	B. The wrapping cloth used for packaging is divided into four types: canvas (10-count yarn, double strands), coarse cloth (10-count warp yarn, 10-count weft yarn), coarse linen cloth, and cotton-linen interwoven cloth, which should be determined according to different needs.

	C. Printed fabrics, light-colored fabrics, and bleached fabrics among printed and dyed fabrics shall be packaged in high-quality kraft paper, five pieces per package. The quality of the paper used must be strong and smooth.

	D. The original packaging materials, bamboo strips, and wrapping cloth, using kraft paper or tar paper, should be implemented according to the actual situation in each region, but all light-colored fabrics, bleached fabrics, and light-colored printed fabrics must not be packaged with tar paper.

(4) For the greige fabric used for printing and dyeing, public and private textile mills, weaving mills, and dyeing mills in various regions should provide double-linked, triple-linked, and quadruple-linked greige fabric as much as possible in the future to reduce loose fabric, machine-head fabric, and save labor.

    政务院财政经济委员会
    关于棉布实施轻浆，印染布匹取消上浆和棉布、印染布匹简化装璜办法的决定
    中央人民政府纺织工业部为实现“增产节约”的决议，提高所有棉布、印染布匹的品质，取消旧社会遗留下来的徒然浪费资财的工作程序和包装商标，经全国织染技术措施节约会议讨论研究，通过了棉布、印染布匹的上浆率，及简化装璜办法的建议。政务院财政经济委员会为此作了决定，通令全国实行。决定要点如下：
    （一）关于棉布及印染布匹的上浆率分别规定为：
    甲、棉布上浆，根据全国目前情况，一律实行轻浆，以百分之十四为全国平均先进上浆率。各地区公私营纺织厂、织布厂、染织厂应根据现有先进轻浆上浆方法，积极推广和试行。自一九五二年十月一日起，各地区公私营纺织厂、织布厂、染织厂，必须将原有上浆率降低至百分之十四以下。此后生产的棉布，除原存重浆布外，如发现有重浆情况，概以违反规定处理。
    乙、印染布匹，自一九五二年八月一日起，全国各地区公私营印染厂、染织厂，所有花布、色布、漂布，一律取消上浆程序。此后除原存有浆印染布匹外，如发现有上浆情况，概作“违反经济法令”处理。
    丙、关于各地区特种需要及工业用的棉布必须上重浆者，及印染布匹必须上浆者，应将品名、规格、用途，在一九五二年七月以前呈报中央纺织工业部与有关部门审核批准。

    乙、商标的大小，一律规定高七·五公分，宽十五公分。梢印大小一律规定高五公分，宽二十公分为标准。
    丙、商标打印地位，应在布边上二·五公分，布头五○公分以内。梢印应加盖在布匹两端八公分以内。
    丁、打印用的颜料应以容易洗褪，不漏色为原则。
    戊、商标印内容，除甲项所规定及经过政府化验批准者外，不准再有“永不褪色”“包不褪色”等欺骗性字句。
    己、自一九五二年八月一日起，除旧存布匹外，如发现有贴印原有商标纸或商标印者，按违反规定处理。
    （三）棉布、印染布匹简化包装的下列各项规定，全国公私营纺织厂、印染厂、染织厂、织布厂应自一九五二年八月一日起实施。
    甲、所有布件捆包一律用上好麻绳代替铁皮。
    乙、打包所用包布分帆布（十支纱双股）、粗布
    （十支经纱，十支纬纱）、粗麻布、棉麻交织布四种，应根据不同需要情况而定。
    丙、印染布匹中印花布、浅色布、漂白布用上好牛皮纸每五匹一包，所用纸张质量必须坚牢光滑。
    丁、原用其他包装材料、竹片、包布，用牛皮纸或柏油纸，应依照各地实际情况实行，但所有浅色布、漂白布、浅地花布，不得用柏油纸包装。
    （四）印染用的坯布，今后各地区公私营纺织厂、织布厂、染织厂应尽可能供应双联、三联、四联坯布，以减少零布、机头布及节约人工。
