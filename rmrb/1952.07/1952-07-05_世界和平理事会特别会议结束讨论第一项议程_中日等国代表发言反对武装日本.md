Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 4th dispatch: The Special Session of the World Peace Council continued its meetings on the evening of the 2nd and the morning of the 3rd to discuss the first item on the agenda, "Peaceful Resolution of the German and Japanese Issues."

    The evening session on the 2nd was chaired by Guo Moruo, the representative of China. Mrs. Fleischmann, the representative of West Germany, spoke first, conveying greetings from several members of the Conference for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Conclusion of a Just Peace Treaty by the German People – former German Chancellor Dr. Wirth, Mrs. Elffer, and Mrs. Kardorff-Oheim. She called for the establishment of a unified and strong Germany as a guarantee of domestic democracy and European peace.

    German writer Seghers stated that the Special Session of the World Peace Council must be followed by actions to ensure the victory of the cause of peace. She pointed out that after the Bonn government openly admitted the fact of West German re-militarization, she said that the peace-loving and hardworking youth of the German Democratic Republic, facing such danger, must be prepared to rise up to defend their motherland.

    Soviet writer Vasilevska spoke about the aggressive nature of the Bonn separate war treaty and the Paris treaty on the so-called "European Defense Community" and the possibility of a peaceful solution to the German problem. She said that in the face of the demands of all peace-loving people in the world, the conspiracy to turn Germany into a springboard for aggression would be shamefully defeated. She supported the Special Session of the World Peace Council's suggestion to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to convene a four-power conference to discuss giving the German people the opportunity to hold free all-German elections and establish an all-German government, concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, and withdrawing all occupying forces from German territory.

    Representatives from Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Finland, and France also spoke during the discussion.

    On the morning of the 3rd, the special session continued, chaired by D’Arboussier, the representative of Africa. During the discussion of the German question, Burke, the representative of the Union of South Africa, Masella, the representative of Uruguay, Hordynova-Spurna, the representative of Czechoslovakia, and Haaland, the representative of Norway, spoke in succession. Masella said that the time when the people of Latin America were not very concerned about the situation in Europe was over forever. We oppose the policy of US imperialism in Latin America, oppose the military agreements imposed on us, and oppose the construction of military bases by the United States in our countries. This is our contribution to peace. Hordynova-Spurna emphasized the significance of the German question for the cause of peace, saying that if peace advocates unite their strength, they can shatter the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers.

    During the discussion of the Japanese question, Japanese representative Kazuo Kawamura and Chinese representative Mei Ru’ao spoke in succession.

    U La, the representative of Burma, recounted the suffering of the Burmese people during the Japanese occupation. He emphasized that the peace-loving Burmese people are determined to oppose the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Suyonikoro, the representative of Indonesia, said that the Indonesian people oppose foreign interference in their internal affairs and oppose US imperialism's restoration of aggressive Japanese imperialism.

    At the end of the morning session, the discussion of the first agenda item came to an end.
