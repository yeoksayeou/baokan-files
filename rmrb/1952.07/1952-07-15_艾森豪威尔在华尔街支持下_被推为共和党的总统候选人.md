Xinhua News Agency, July 14th dispatch from Chicago: The U.S. Republican National Convention, convened to nominate a presidential candidate, has concluded amidst much commotion. In the final session held on July 11th, former Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Military Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, and current California Senator Nixon was nominated as the vice-presidential candidate.

The reason Eisenhower was able to defeat his rival Taft in the fierce factional struggles within the Republican Party was because he received support from Wall Street. The largest monopoly capitalist groups in the United States, including the Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, Mellon, and Ford consortiums, did their utmost to support Eisenhower. They used agents, and even came forward themselves, to buy off delegates, promising money, official positions, and other "benefits" to those who supported Eisenhower. In the later days of the convention, this buying activity even developed to the point of on-the-spot cash transactions. For example, Illinois delegates Jack Thomas and Raymond Peacock, who supported Taft, revealed to reporters from the "Chicago Tribune" that the Eisenhower camp had separately asked them to support Eisenhower, with the price being that Thomas could receive a sum of money, and Peacock's ten small newspapers could get a volume of advertising business. Thanks to this kind of bribery, by the time the Republican convention voted for a presidential candidate on the 11th, the situation had undergone a great change. Eisenhower, who was originally in the minority, received an overwhelming majority of eight hundred and forty-five votes, while Taft, who had been leading all along, received only two hundred and eighty votes. In this way, Eisenhower stepped onto the field of competition for the next U.S. presidency as Wall Street's new favorite.

Everyone knows that Eisenhower, who is now the Republican presidential candidate, has always been an important representative and active supporter of Democratic Party policies in the past. It can be seen from his actions and declarations that he will continue to implement the current policies of the Truman administration, which represent the interests of the Wall Street financial groups. The reason Eisenhower has won the favor of Wall Street proves that although the U.S. global aggression policy, nominally "Total Diplomacy," has been completely bankrupt, to the extent that the Democratic Truman administration has lost all popular support, the large U.S. monopoly capitalists, whose overseas investments are increasingly expanding, are determined to maintain this bankrupt policy to the end. It is precisely for this reason that they have spared no effort to disguise Eisenhower as an "opposition party member," hoping that he can use this to deceive voters into "trusting" him to take over Truman's aggression scheme, which has become difficult to sustain.

    艾森豪威尔在华尔街支持下
    被推为共和党的总统候选人
    【新华社十四日讯】芝加哥消息：为提名总统候选人而召开的美国共和党全国代表大会已在吵吵闹闹中结束。在七月十一日举行的最后一次会议上，前北大西洋军总司令艾森豪威尔被推为共和党的总统候选人，现任加利福尼亚州参议员尼可逊被推为副总统候选人。
    艾森豪威尔之所以能在共和党内激烈的派系斗争中战胜他的敌手塔夫脱，是因为他得到了华尔街的支持。美国最大的垄断资本家集团，包括摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦、梅隆和福特诸大财团在内，都竭力为艾森豪威尔撑腰。他们通过代理人，甚至亲自出马来收买代表，答应给支持艾森豪威尔的人以金钱、官职和其他“好处”。在会议的后几天，这种收买活动还发展到就地举行现款交易的程度。例如，支持塔夫脱的伊利诺斯州代表杰克·托马斯和雷蒙特·皮柯克曾向“芝加哥论坛报”的记者透露：艾森豪威尔派曾分别要求他们支持艾森豪威尔，代价是托马斯可以得到一笔钱，而皮柯克所有的十家小报可以得到一笔广告生意。靠了这种收买，到共和党大会在十一日投票选举总统候选人时，形势就发生极大的变化。原来占少数的艾森豪威尔得到了八百四十五票的绝大多数，原来一直领先的塔夫脱只得到二百八十票。这样，艾森豪威尔就以华尔街新的宠儿的姿态走上了争夺美国下届总统的逐鹿场。
    大家都知道，目前已成为共和党总统候选人的艾森豪威尔过去一直是民主党政策的重要代表和积极拥护者。从他的行动和宣言中都可以看出，他今后也仍然将继续执行杜鲁门政府的也就是代表华尔街财阀利益的现行政策。艾森豪威尔之所以能博得华尔街的宠幸证明：虽然名为“总体外交”的美国全球侵略政策已经完全破产，以致民主党的杜鲁门政府已经失尽民心，但是，海外投资日趋扩张的美国大垄断资本家们还是决心要把这个破了产的政策维持到底。正是因为这个缘故，他们才不惜把艾森豪威尔打扮成为一个“在野党人”，希望他能以此骗得选民的“信任”，而来接替杜鲁门已经难乎为继的侵略勾当。
