From Bucharest to Korea is about 15,000 kilometers.

Although Romania and Korea are far apart, the friendship between the two countries is solid and close.

In an open letter to the Korean people, the Romanian people said: "Although Korea is 10,000 kilometers away, it is very close to us, and the Korean people live in our hearts."

The enthusiastic support of the Romanian people greatly encouraged the Korean people, and vehicles loaded with supplies and encouraging letters came to Korea one after another.

Last May, a Romanian medical team consisting of six doctors, pharmacists, X-ray technicians, and twenty nurses came to fighting Korea. They treated the wounded People's Army soldiers in the just war, treated the Korean people injured by the barbaric American bombing, and later helped the Korean people defeat the enemy's germ warfare. They brought thirteen train cars of medical equipment and medicines.

Professor Zhou Laiyi Yiyun, the head of the delegation, is a famous professor at the Medical School of the University of Bucharest. For more than 20 years, he has specialized in surgical treatment and treated 12,000 wounded. Now, he dedicates his high skills and responsible spirit to the fighting Korean people. In his surgical operations in Korea, he has cured many difficult wounds. He once removed more than 100 bullets and shrapnel from the wounded soldier Bai Mingde, saving the life of this seriously wounded warrior. The warrior Zhuo Wanshu, whose lower right lung was pierced by a bullet, gradually recovered after he underwent lung surgery.

The warrior Jin Xinggan had shrapnel through his head. The Romanian medical team performed difficult head surgery on him and removed several pieces of shrapnel that had penetrated his head. Soon, he was able to sit up and tell stories to the nurses.

They worked day and night. Professor Zhou Laiyi Yiyun's palms were swollen from performing troublesome surgeries every day. His own hands were also bandaged; however, when the wounded soldiers greeted him with concern and advised him to rest, he replied, "It doesn't matter, these are common little things." He said, "I haven't been in Korea for very long, and I have already gained a lot of medical experience in my work. Difficult surgeries that I have not experienced in the past 20 years have been successful this time. This is the result of the infinite encouragement and inspiration given to me by the heroic Korean people."

The wounded soldiers saw the professor's firm confidence and hard-working spirit, and were grateful for his enthusiasm and friendship. They earnestly carried out all the doctor's instructions, striving to recover as soon as possible so that they could return to the front lines of combat and production.

The nurses of the medical team devoted all their efforts to cooperate with the selfless work of doctors and technicians, helping the wounded to recover their health as soon as possible. Tang Ke-Meita, an 18-year-old girl, became physically weak due to overwork. The head of the delegation wanted her to return home to recuperate, but she refused to return home before completing her work task. She insisted, "My body can still work." Every day from dusk to morning, she never left the wounded.

In the shade of the trees around the hospital, Romanian nurses and convalescing soldiers of the Korean People's Army often had cordial conversations. The nurses happily explained the collection of poems by the famous Romanian poet Mihail Beniuc: "Korea Fights for Freedom." They told the wounded, "This is the poem that the Romanian people love to recite the most now."

They said: "We Romanian people express our infinite admiration and sympathy for the people who are fighting heroically for the freedom and independence of their motherland. Therefore, we feel supreme honor to come to Korea and work with you."

    罗马尼亚医疗团在朝鲜
    从布加勒斯特到朝鲜，约有一万五千公里。
    罗马尼亚和朝鲜的距离虽远，但两国的友情是巩固而密切地连结着的。
    罗马尼亚人民在写给朝鲜人民的一封公开信里说：“朝鲜虽然远在一万公里外，但是它和我们很近，朝鲜人民活在我们的心里。”
    罗马尼亚人民的热烈声援大大鼓舞着朝鲜人民，装载着物资和激励信件的车辆，也陆续来到了朝鲜。
    去年五月，罗马尼亚的六名医生、药剂师、爱克司光技师和二十名护士组成的医疗团，来到了战斗的朝鲜。他们医治在正义战争中受伤的人民军伤员，医治被美国野蛮轰炸而受伤的朝鲜人民，以后并协助朝鲜人民战胜了敌人的细菌战。他们带来了十三火车医疗器械和药品。
    团长周来伊益温教授是布加勒斯特综合大学医学院的著名教授。二十多年来，他专门研究外科治疗，并医治过一万二千名伤员。现在，他把他的高度技术和负责精神倾献于战斗的朝鲜人民。他在朝鲜进行外科手术中，曾治好了许多难治的创伤。他曾经在伤员白明德身上取下百余颗子弹头和弹片，抢救了这个重伤战士的生命。被子弹射穿了右肺下部的战士卓万洙，经过他施行肺部手术以后，慢慢恢复健康了。
    战士金星干曾被弹片穿通头部。罗马尼亚医疗团对他施行了困难的头部手术，取出了几个打入头内的弹片。不久，他就能坐起来和护士们讲故事了。
    他们不分昼夜地进行工作。周来伊益温教授因为每天做着麻烦的手术，他的手掌肿起来了。他自己的手上也缠上了绷带；但是，当伤员们关切地慰问他，并劝他休息时，他回答道：“不要紧，这是普通人常有的小事情。”他说：“我来到朝鲜，还没有多少日子，在自己的工作过程中，已经收到了许多医学上的经验。在过去二十多年中所未经历过的困难手术，这次都成功了。这就是英勇的朝鲜人民给予我无限鼓舞和激励的结果。”
    伤员们看到了教授的坚决信心和艰苦奋斗的精神，都感激他的热情和友谊。他们认真地执行医生们的一切指示，力求早日痊愈，好重返战斗和生产的前线。
    医疗团的护士们，倾注一切努力，配合医生和技师的忘我工作，帮助伤员早日恢复健康。十八岁的少女唐克—美塔，因为过度的劳累，以致身体衰弱。团长要她回国休养，但她在未完成工作任务以前绝不肯回国。她坚持说：“我的身体还可以工作。”她每天从黄昏到早晨，一步也不离开伤员的身边。
    在医院周围的树荫下，时常有罗马尼亚的护士们和朝鲜人民军的休养员们在亲切地谈话。护士们愉快地讲解着罗马尼亚著名诗人米哈逸倍纽克的诗集：“朝鲜为了自由而斗争”。她们告诉伤员：“这是现在罗马尼亚人民最爱诵读的诗。”
    她们说：“我们罗马尼亚人民，对为了祖国的自由独立而英勇战斗的人民，表示无限崇敬和同情。所以我们到朝鲜和你们一起工作，感到无上的光荣。”
