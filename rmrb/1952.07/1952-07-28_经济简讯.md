    The Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference Organizes and Leads Transactions
    The planned and organized leadership of transactions is the main feature of this Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference. The conference leadership organized professional meetings and regional exchange meetings for several important commodities such as cowhide, grain, timber, and industrial equipment. These meetings overcame the shortcomings of blind purchasing and sales by state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private industrialists and merchants, enabling transactions to be carried out in a planned manner. At the professional meetings, the selling and buying parties studied the production and sales and supply and demand of commodities, enabling a more rational distribution of some important commodities and commodities that are uniformly purchased and sold by state-owned economic departments. For example, the industrial equipment needed in Northeast China and other places, the timber needed in provinces such as Pingyuan, and the cowhide needed in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places were all successfully traded after consultation at professional meetings. Regional exchange meetings are another form of transaction organized after the conference basically grasped the direction of the flow of industrial and agricultural products. Delegations from various provinces simultaneously organized internal exchanges at the conference, which expanded the sales of local and special products. For example, the long-term unsalable live pigs, eggs, native sugar, native cloth, and native tobacco in the Central South Region opened up sales channels through this method. Some fast-selling goods in short supply have also been more rationally distributed.
    Northeast China's Spring Wheat Harvest is Bumper
    This year's spring wheat in Northeast China has had a bumper harvest, and various places are stepping up harvesting. The main wheat-producing areas in Northeast China are Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces, with the wheat field area of ​​the two provinces accounting for about 75 percent of the entire region. This year's wheat in Songjiang Province is the best, a bumper harvest unseen in many years. Last year, the average yield of wheat in Songjiang Province was about 1,600 jin per hectare (15 mu); this year, the average yield per hectare may be 2,000 jin. In Heilongjiang Province, due to continuous cloudy and foggy days in mid-July, wheat in some areas suffered from yellow rust disease, resulting in lower yields; however, the average yield of the entire province can still exceed the original planned figures. The wheat harvest in Jilin, Liaodong, and Liaoxi provinces is not as good as that in Songjiang, but generally better than last year. This year's wheat in Jilin Province may increase by about 10 percent compared to last year. In Tai'an County, the main wheat-producing area in Liaoxi Province, it is estimated that the average yield per hectare can also reach 2,000 jin. The wheat in Gaokan Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City yielded more than 3,500 jin per hectare.

    中南区物资交流大会有组织地领导交易
    有计划有组织地领导交易，是这次中南区物资交流大会的主要特点。大会领导方面组织了牛皮、粮食、木材、工业器材等几种重要商品的专业会议和地区交流会议。这些会议克服了国营贸易公司、合作社、私营工商业者盲目购销的缺点，使交易有计划地进行。在专业会议上，销售双方研究了商品的产销、供求情况，使一些重要商品和由国营经济部门统一购销的商品得到比较合理的分配。例如：东北等地所需要的工业器材，平原等省所需要的木材，上海、武汉等地所需要的牛皮等，都是经过专业会议协商后圆满成交的。地区交流会议是大会基本上掌握了工农业产品流转方向后组织交易的另一种形式，各省代表团在大会内同时组织省内交流，这样就扩大了土产、特产的推销。例如中南区长久滞销的生猪、鸡蛋、土糖、土布、土烟等都是通过这一方式打开销路的。一些供不应求的畅销货也得到了比较合理的分配。
    东北区春播小麦丰收
    今年东北的春播小麦丰收了，各地正加紧收割。东北的主要产麦区是黑龙江和松江两省，两省麦田面积约占全区百分之七十五。今年松江省的小麦最好，是多年未有的大丰收。去年松江省小麦平均每垧（合十五市亩）约收一千六百斤；今年每垧平均可能收两千斤。黑龙江省由于七月中旬连日阴雾，部分地区的小麦发生黄锈病，产量较低；但全省的平均产量，仍能超过原订的计划数字。吉林、辽东、辽西等省麦收不如松江，但一般比去年好。吉林省今年的小麦比去年可增产百分之十左右。辽西省主要产麦区台安县，估计每垧也能平均收到两千斤。沈阳市郊高坎村的小麦，每垧收了三千五百多斤。
