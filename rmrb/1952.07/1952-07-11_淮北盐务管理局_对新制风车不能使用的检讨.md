    Huai Bei Salt Affairs Bureau
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Unusability of Newly Made Windmills
    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Xiao Jin in the Readers' Letters column on June 9, criticizing our bureau for manufacturing a large number of unusable windmills. This criticism is correct and very helpful for improving our work in the future.
    These windmills were not manufactured perfectly. The reason is that we lacked careful research and thorough consideration of this task beforehand. We only studied how to improve the tools and conducted some typical experiments. Then, we subjectively decided to set up a factory for manufacturing and immediately produced 700 units. When the manufacturing was almost complete, we conducted experiments and discovered many faults. The main problems were chain dropping, chain entanglement, and damage to the flared horn, which resulted in them being unusable when distributed to the salt fields. This not only partially delayed salt production but also heavily tied up national funds, causing waste. This is because the leading cadres have serious bureaucratic work styles, reflecting an irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause. We accept this lesson, and in addition to continuing research to improve the work, the responsible comrades have also made a profound self-criticism and requested the higher authorities to give due punishment.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对新制风车不能使用的检讨
    编辑同志：六月九日人民日报读者来信栏发表小劲同志来信，批评我局新制大批风车不能使用，这一批评是正确的，对我们今后改进工作有很大的帮助。
    这批风车是制造得不够完善的，其原因，主要是事前我们对这项工作缺乏慎重研究和周密考虑，仅从改进工具上去研究，只做了一些典型试验，就主观地决定设厂制造，一下制造了七百辆。等到制造将要完成，我们进行试验时，才发觉多处故障，主要的毛病是掉链、结链、括喇叭口等，以致分配到各盐场去不能使用。这就不但局部地延误了制盐生产，而且大量搁压了国家资金，造成浪费。这是由于我们领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，表现了对人民事业不负责任的态度。我们接受这次的教训，除了继续研究以改进工作外，负责同志还作了深刻的检讨，并请求上级给予应得的处分。
    淮北盐务管理局
