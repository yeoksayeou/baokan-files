Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 19th: According to a New York "Daily Worker" report on the 14th, William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, sent a cable to the Japanese Communist Party to congratulate it on its 30th anniversary.

The cable said: "We Communists and non-Communist workers in our country believe that the Japanese people's significant struggle for national independence and democratic freedom is a struggle that is advancing towards victory under the leadership of your great Party. The heroism you have demonstrated under brutal police repression is an encouragement to the people in our country who are currently facing increasingly rampant terror and atrocities.

"We firmly oppose the harsh San Francisco Treaty and Security Treaty imposed on Japan by Wall Street imperialists in order to turn your country into a colony and dependency. Under the protection of the imperialist ruling clique in our country, the feudal and militarist elements in your country are now attempting to restore fascist ideological control and terror in Japan, sever the ties between the Japanese people and their natural allies in China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, and drag Japan into new suicidal aggression, which we deeply regret."

The cable concluded: "We American Communists recognize that we have a particularly important responsibility to organize the growing desire for peace among our people into a powerful force to prevent Wall Street from heading towards war and fascism, to prevent Wall Street from enslaving other peoples and countries, and to help achieve a Five-Power Peace Pact."

    美共主席福斯特电贺日共成立三十周年
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】据纽约“工人日报”十四日消息：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特致电日本共产党祝贺它成立三十周年纪念。
    电文说：“我们共产党人和我国非共产党工人认为日本人民争取民族独立和民主自由的意义重大的斗争，是一个在你们伟大的党的领导下正向胜利迈进的斗争。你们在残暴的警察镇压之下所表现的英雄主义，对于我国目前处于日益猖獗的恐怖和暴行的境遇下的人民是一种鼓励。
    “我们坚决反对华尔街帝国主义者为了把你们的国家变为殖民地和附庸国而强加之于日本的苛刻的旧金山和约与安全条约。在我国帝国主义统治集团的庇护下，你们国家的封建与军国主义分子现在又企图在日本恢复法西斯思想控制和恐怖，切断日本人民与它在中国、苏联及亚洲其他国家的天然盟友的联系，拖日本参加新的自杀性侵略，我们对此深感痛心。”
    电文最后说：“我们美国共产党人认识到，我们有特别重大的责任，要把我国人民日益高涨的和平愿望组织成为强大的力量，来阻止华尔街走向战争与法西斯主义，不让华尔街奴役别的人民与国家，并帮助实现五大国和平公约。”
