Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Although Beijing has been experiencing continuous rainy days, the stadiums, theaters, and troop representative team camps for the "August 1st" Sports Meet are all filled with a fervent atmosphere of welcoming the opening of the games.

    The ball game athletes from each representative team are active on the fields every day, even continuing their practice matches in football, basketball, and volleyball in the rain. The competitions are filled with a spirit of humility, friendship, and eagerness to learn. The football team from the Military Academy praised the bravery, ingenuity, and agility of the football team from the Southwest Military Region. Some representative teams even invited athletes from brother units to hold symposiums to exchange sports experiences.

    Swimmers from the Central South Military Region, to acclimate to the water temperature in Beijing, which is colder than in the south, braved the wind and rain every day to practice hard at the swimming pool with swimmers from brother units. Many track and field athletes are also training early and late at the stadium and near the camps, continuing to improve their results. Liu Yunfu, an athlete from a certain unit participating in weightlifting, has increased his lifting weight by more than five kilograms in just a few days due to diligent study and practice. In the skies near Beijing, aviation sports athletes have already conducted several excellent rehearsals. Brave and spirited male and female equestrian athletes frequently ride their strong horses on the newly built track in the stadium. Motorcycle athletes are speeding on the avenues near Beijing.

    In the theater, cultural and artistic representative teams hold previews of singing, dancing, and acrobatics almost every night. They humbly seek opinions from members of brother cultural and artistic representative teams, as well as literary writers and critics, to continue improving their performances. Comrades from the People's Liberation Army representative team unanimously praised the performances of the volunteer soldiers from the Korean front. Every day, from early morning, the camps of the cultural and artistic representative teams are filled with resounding songs and beautiful music.

    Representatives from various troops participating in the military-wide cultural examination are also diligently reviewing their lessons.

    Through continued practice and previews after arriving in Beijing, representatives from each team have further improved their level. With a strong will to defend the motherland and safeguard peace, and a highly enterprising spirit, they guarantee the success of the military-wide "August 1st" Sports Meet.
