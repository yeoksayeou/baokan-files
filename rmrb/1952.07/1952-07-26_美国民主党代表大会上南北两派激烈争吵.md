Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, July 23rd: According to TASS, fierce quarrels have erupted between the delegations from the northern and southern states, who have long-standing grudges, at the US Democratic National Convention currently being held in Chicago.

Under pressure from the heads of Northern party organizations, the Americans for Democratic Action, and a united faction of right-wing labor leaders, the Democratic National Convention, after a fierce debate on the morning of July 22, passed a resolution requiring all state delegations to provide a so-called "loyalty" pledge. The resolution stipulated that the Credentials Committee would not allow representatives to attend the convention unless they assured the Credentials Committee that they would do everything possible to have the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates selected by the National Convention appear on the ballots in their respective states.

The reason why the heads of the Northern Democrats forced through this resolution seems to be because they feared that the Southern Democrats, who control the Democratic machines in several Southern states, might break away from the Democratic Party in the general election and attempt to list Eisenhower's name as the presidential candidate for both the Democratic and Republican parties in these states, or might, as in 1948, put forward independent Southern Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

Currently, in the six Southern states of Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and South Carolina, Southern Democratic politicians who control the state-level Democratic machines have made preparations to decide what action they should take at future statewide party conventions if the platform passed by the convention and the presidential candidates selected are not satisfactory to them. These arrangements by Southern Democratic politicians have become a clear threat of division within the Democratic Party during the election campaign.

South Carolina Governor and former Secretary of State Byrnes did not participate in the convention debate, but members of his delegation participated in the Southern Democrats' angry protest against the resolution. Many believe that Byrnes is a key figure in the Southern Democratic camp, and in the past, he has hinted several times that under certain circumstances, he might be willing to abandon the Democratic Party in the election campaign to support the Republican Party. It is known that he has had connections with large Wall Street corporations for many years, and before becoming Governor of South Carolina, he was a director of Newmont Mining Corporation, controlled by Morgan.

Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, July 24th: TASS reported that when the Democratic National Convention held its third plenary session on the afternoon of July 22, the main speaker was Dawson, Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a member of Congress.

Dawson condemned the recently held Republican National Convention, saying: "We have seen that the old forces that controlled previous Republican National Conventions have once again controlled this recent Republican National Convention—they are a bunch of big international bankers and big privileged entrepreneurs who regard the United States as a special place for them to expand their power and make a fortune."

In order to conceal the true role of the Democratic Party, Dawson deliberately mystified it, describing the Democratic Party as the "party of the people."

Dawson then praised the United States' aggression against Korea.

The other speakers at the third plenary session—almost all of whom were members of Congress—also supported Truman's intervention in Korea and his general policies.

    美国民主党代表大会上南北两派激烈争吵
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社芝加哥二十三日讯：目前正在芝加哥举行的美国民主党全国代表大会上，一向就有宿怨的北部与南部各州的代表团间爆发了激烈的争吵。
    民主党全国代表大会在北方党组织的首脑、美国人民主行动协会和右翼工会领袖的联合派的压力下，在二十二日上午经过激烈的辩论后，通过了一项决议，要求一切州代表团提出所谓“忠诚”保证。这个决议规定，代表们除非向资格审查委员会保证他们将竭尽所能使全国代表大会所选出的总统与副总统候选人的名字出现在他们各自州内的选票上，资格审查委员会就不允许他们出席大会。
    北方民主党首脑们所以要强迫通过这个决议，似乎是因为他们害怕控制着南方若干州的民主党机器的南方民主党分子可能在大选中脱离民主党，而试图把艾森豪威尔的名字当作民主党和共和党双方的总统候选人列在这些州的选票上，或者可能像在一九四八年那样，提出独立的南方民主党的总统和副总统候选人。
    目前在弗吉尼亚、佐治亚、密士失必、路易斯安那、得克萨斯和南卡罗来纳这南方六个州中，控制着州级民主党机器的南方民主党政客们已经作了准备，如果大会通过的政纲和选出的总统候选人不能使他们满意，他们就要在将来举行的全州党代表大会上来决定他们应采取什么行动。南方民主党政客们的这些安排已经成为民主党在竞选运动中发生分裂的显明威胁。
    南卡罗来纳州州长、前国务卿贝尔纳斯没有参加大会辩论，但是他的代表团团员参加了南方民主党对决议的愤怒抗议。许多人认为贝尔纳斯是南方民主党阵营中的主要人物，过去，他曾经几次暗示在某种情况下，他可能愿意在竞选运动中放弃民主党来支持共和党。人们知道：多少年来，他就和华尔街大企业有关系，而且他在做南卡罗来纳州州长以前，原来是摩根控制下的纽芒特矿业公司的董事。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社芝加哥二十四日电：七月二十二日下午民主党全国代表大会举行第三次全体会议时，主要的发言人是民主党全国委员会副主席、国会议员道逊。
    道逊谴责最近举行的共和党全国代表大会说： “我们看到控制历届共和党代表大会的旧势力，又控制了最近这一次的共和党代表大会——他们都是一帮大国际银行家，大特权企业家，他们把美国当做使他们自己扩张势力和发财的特别场所。”
    为了掩饰民主党的真正作用，道逊故弄玄虚，把民主党说成是“人民的党”。
    道逊随即赞扬美国对朝鲜的侵略。
    第三次全体会议上的其他的发言人——几乎全是议员——也都拥护杜鲁门的干涉朝鲜和他的一般政策。
