Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The special session of the World Peace Council held its closing meeting on the evening of the 6th, presided over by Italian representative Nenni. At the meeting, World Peace Council Secretary, Gore, first rose to speak, announcing the list of candidates for new council members proposed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The attendees passed the list with warm applause. Belgian representative Blum then read the draft of the World Peace Council's letter to the governments of the four major powers and the people of the world regarding the German question; Indian representative Anand read the draft resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Japanese question; Fach proposed a draft resolution on the immediate cessation of the Korean War; Nenni suggested approving the "Appeal to the Men and Women of the World Against Germ Warfare" passed by the Standing Committee at the Oslo meeting in April this year, and read out the declaration on convening the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5 this year. These documents were unanimously passed and approved by all attendees amidst warm applause. Subsequently, Nenni, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, delivered a closing speech, summarizing the achievements of the meeting. He pointed out that the task of his speech today was to once again emphasize the particular importance of certain issues in the current international situation. These issues must continue to be the focus of everyone's attention, and the members of the Council must work on these issues in their respective countries. The first conclusion that can be drawn now is regarding the deterioration of the international situation. In recent months, aggressive militarism has crossed three stages: the San Francisco Treaty and agreements between Japan and the United States, the "General Treaty" and accompanying agreements signed in Bonn on May 26 this year, and the "European Army" treaty signed in Paris on May 27 this year. At the same time, the Korean War continues, and although armistice negotiations are underway, the situation continues to deteriorate day by day. The bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants shows that the Pentagon has not abandoned the provocative policies previously adopted by MacArthur. Another conclusion that can be drawn now is that the deterioration of the international situation has awakened world public opinion, further expanded the peace front, made the broad masses of the people more determined to demand a change in policy, and at the same time strengthened the suppression by reactionary authorities. All of this has been very evident in the discussions at this meeting.

Nenni continued: Today, we are not only growing in number, but also more determined than ever before. Six hundred million people have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, indicating their participation in the ranks of peace supporters and awakening the consciousness of millions upon millions of other people.

Speaking of the upcoming World People's Peace Congress, Nenni emphasized: The Peace Congress is not a celebratory parade, nor a market, but an opportunity for us to organize mass work. The extent to which this conference can achieve depends on our preparations. The fate of the conference does not depend on the number of representatives and individual abilities, but on all the work we have been doing until the eve of the conference. No one can stop us from accomplishing our mission. In the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and around the world, reason is developing, because the iron reality has put the issues of opposing arms expansion and Atlantic policy on the agenda, which greatly facilitates us in completing these tasks. Nenni concluded: Let us move forward bravely, regardless of the countless obstacles on the road to peace. This will increase our confidence in our own strength and help us achieve our goal - to ease the tension between governments.

When the meeting was declared closed, all attendees stood up, and the hall resounded with long and thunderous applause.

    世界和平理事会特别会议闭幕会议
    通过关于德国日本和朝鲜问题的决议
    并通过关于在十二月五日召开世界人民和平大会的宣言
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议于六日晚间举行闭幕会议，由意大利代表南尼任主席。会上，世界和平理事会秘书戈尔首先起立发言，宣读了世界和平理事会常务委员会所提出的新理事的候选人名单。到会者在热烈的掌声中通过了这个名单。比利时代表布伦姆接着宣读了世界和平理事会关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书草案；印度代表安纳德宣读了关于和平解决日本问题的决议草案；法奇提出了关于立即停止朝鲜战争的决议草案；南尼建议批准常务委员会今年四月间奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书，并宣读了关于在今年十二月五日在维也纳召开世界人民和平大会的宣言，这些文件都在热烈掌声中获得全体与会者的一致通过和批准。接着，南尼代表世界和平理事会常务委员会致闭幕辞，总结了这次会议的成果。他指出：他今天的发言的任务，就是再一次强调目前国际形势中某些问题的特别重要性。这些问题必须继续成为大家注意的中心，理事会的委员们，都必须围绕这些问题在本国进行工作。现在可能作出的第一个结论，就是关于国际局势的恶化方面的。最近几月来，侵略性的军国主义已跨越了三个阶段：日本和美国间的旧金山条约和协定，今年五月二十六日在波恩签订的“一般性条约”和附带的协定，以及今年五月二十七日在巴黎签订的“欧洲军”条约。和这同时，朝鲜战争仍在继续着，虽然停战谈判正在进行，但局势仍然一天天恶化。对鸭绿江水力发电厂的轰炸说明五角大楼仍然没有放弃麦克阿瑟以前所采取的挑衅政策。现在可以得出的另一个结论是：国际局势的恶化唤起了世界舆论的觉醒，使和平阵线更加扩大，使广大的人民群众愈来愈坚决地要求改变政策，同时也使反动当局的镇压加强了。这一切在这次会议的讨论当中已经表现得非常明显。
    南尼接着说：今天，我们不仅在数量上壮大，而且也比以前任何时候都更加坚决了。六亿人民在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名，表示他们参加到和平拥护者的队伍里，并且唤醒了另外千千万万人民的觉悟。
    谈到即将举行的世界人民和平大会时南尼强调说：和平大会不是什么庆祝游行，也不是什么市集，而是我们组织群众工作的一个机会。这个大会能取得多大的成就，取决于我们的准备工作。大会的命运不决定于代表的数目和个人能力，而决定于我们一直到大会开幕前夕所进行的全部工作。没有人能够阻止我们完成我们的任务。在美国、英国、法国、德国以及世界各地，理性都在发展着，因为铁的现实把反对扩张军备和大西洋政策的问题提上了日程，这样就大大地便利我们完成这些任务。南尼最后说：让我们不顾和平道路上的无数障碍勇往直前吧。这样就会增加我们对自己力量的信心，并帮助我们达到我们的目标——缓和各国政府之间的紧张局面。
    会议宣告闭幕时，全体到会者起立，大厅里响起了经久不息的雷动掌声。
