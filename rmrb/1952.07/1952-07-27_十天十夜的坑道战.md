    Ten Days and Nights of Tunnel Warfare
    Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Wei Ming
    In mid-June, on the left front of the Jincheng line, the forward troops of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers were guarding their positions.
    After repelling numerous enemy attacks and inflicting over 500 casualties, He Jiasheng, the deputy platoon leader of the first platoon, Qin Guihua, the squad leader of the first squad, and Li Jingsheng, the squad leader of the seventh squad, led the soldiers of the first squad and four soldiers of the seventh squad to nearby tunnel fortifications. They intended to continue inflicting casualties on the enemy and await an opportunity to coordinate with the main force in a counterattack.
    At this time, He Jiasheng, Qin Guihua, and several soldiers had already been wounded, but they continued to persevere heroically. The fifteen warriors retreated into the tunnel. To the enemy occupying the hilltop field fortifications, it was as if they were sitting atop a volcano about to erupt.
    The tunnel fortifications were built into the hillside, painstakingly carved out day and night by the Volunteer soldiers with picks and hammers. After the fifteen warriors entered the tunnel, Li Jingsheng, the seventh squad leader and a Communist Party member, arranged several firing points. He assigned Yang Zhengfeng, a soldier with a head wound, to guard one firing point; soldiers Gong Changan and Wang Qipei, who had a forehead wound, to guard another firing point; and he ordered cook Wu Zhenhai and machine gun ammunition handler Jia Gao to guard the right-side firing point with submachine guns. Each time he made an assignment, Li Jingsheng firmly told them: "Defend this position resolutely, do not let the enemy get one step closer! Conserve ammunition and prepare to counterattack the enemy!" Three enemies quickly searched over from the right. Cook Wu Zhenhai猛扣扳机 swept them down. The enemy kept coming to the tunnel entrance to drag away their wounded and dead bodies. Wu Zhenhai and Jia Gao used crossfire to simultaneously sweep, killing more than twenty more enemies. In the end, the enemy had to leave their dead bodies and wounded in front of the tunnel, and they dared not approach the tunnel any further.
    However, the warriors faced serious difficulties. They only had about two thousand rounds of ammunition, a box of compressed dry rations, and a small box of biscuits. There was no water in the tunnel. When thirsty, they could only lick their parched lips or suck on the damp stones. When extremely hungry, they could not swallow the dry rations and biscuits without water. Under such difficult conditions, they tensely resisted the enemy's attacks during the day and waited anxiously at the entrance of the tunnel at night to coordinate with the main force's counterattack. They knew that persevering was victory. Sichuanese youth soldiers Tang Xianfu and Wang Qipei chatted about their hometowns while resting after guard duty, sometimes even singing a few Sichuan folk tunes. Qin Guihua, a seriously wounded member of the Communist Youth League, still sang Cantonese tunes in a dry, hoarse voice from time to time. When the sentries guarding inside the cave heard our artillery shells exploding on the enemy's positions on the hilltop, they quickly told everyone this encouraging news.
    He Jiasheng, the deputy platoon leader and a Communist Party member, was slightly less injured and continued to perform his command duties, encouraging the soldiers to persevere in combat and prepare for a counterattack. He entrusted Li Jingsheng to make specific arrangements. Li Jingsheng tirelessly stood guard, checked on posts, took care of the wounded, cleaned guns, loaded bullets, and studied how to coordinate with the main force to counterattack the enemy. On the hilltop above the tunnel, an enemy heavy machine gun was aimed directly at the direction of our counterattacking troops. Li Jingsheng planned to rush out of the tunnel and seize this heavy machine gun during the counterattack. Sometimes, he even climbed to the river mouth to throw grenades at the enemy's machine gun fortifications. He endured thirst and hunger, encouraging everyone by saying: "Hardship is glory. As long as we endure these hardships and persevere until the main force counterattacks, we will win! The ability of a Communist Party member lies in leading everyone to overcome difficulties in the most difficult times!" His exemplary actions encouraged all the soldiers, increasing their confidence and strength to overcome difficulties.
    On the fourth day of perseverance, He Jiasheng, Li Jingsheng, and Zhang Changming, a wounded Communist Party member, held a Party group meeting to study the current situation and the tasks of the Party members. After the meeting, they gathered the soldiers for a general meeting. He Jiasheng and Li Jingsheng encouraged everyone to persevere and announced the operational plan for cooperating with the troops during the counterattack. At the meeting, cook Wu Zhenhai and soldier Jia Gao volunteered to fetch water from the kitchen occupied by the enemy. So everyone discussed how to fetch the water. On the sixth day, Jia Gao, covered by the submachine gunner, rushed to the kitchen and brought back a bucket of water. This quenched everyone's thirst after six days and six nights. The next day, Wu Zhenhai brought back three more buckets of water. They drank water and ate a little dry food, continuing to persevere in the battle.
    On the night of the seventeenth, He Jiasheng and Li Jingsheng studied the situation again and decided to send some comrades to break through and report the situation to the troops in order to coordinate the battle. They agreed on contact signals. That night, Wu Zhenhai and Wang Qipei broke through with three wounded soldiers.
    On the morning of the eighteenth, Wang Qipei was already sitting in the battalion's forward command post. After listening to Wang Qipei's report, the battalion commander said excitedly: "You are good sons of the motherland, tenacious and firm fighters. Tonight, we are preparing to counterattack the original seventh squad's position. Take another squad into the tunnel and persevere until the counterattack."
    After midnight, Wang Qipei led the deputy company commander and a squad of soldiers, groping their way toward the tunnel. They met Li Jingsheng and the remaining warriors in the darkness. The soldiers were so excited that tears streamed down their faces. Li Jingsheng and the deputy company commander shook hands tightly. His face had just been injured by enemy artillery shells and was still bleeding. But he still requested to persevere with the deputy company commander and others. The deputy company commander firmly ordered him to take the wounded back to the troops to rest first, and he himself led the remaining soldiers to defend the tunnel.
    Li Jingsheng returned to his position and was invited to the command post by the division leaders. They received cordial greetings from the division leaders. Li Jingsheng represented the heroes defending the tunnel and participated in the ongoing division-wide celebration conference. Wearing a big red flower presented by local Korean women representatives, he reported the battle situation of their tunnel defense to the conference representatives.
    At this moment, our army launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy. Intense artillery fire bombarded the enemy's position. The soldiers defending the tunnel nervously held their guns and grenades, standing at the entrance of the tunnel, ready to attack. The young soldiers gently sang along with the sound of the artillery. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, the counterattacking troops stormed up the mountain, and the soldiers defending the tunnel quickly seized the enemy's machine gun on the hilltop. Due to the close cooperation of the warriors in the tunnel, our counterattacking troops ended the battle in just ten minutes. The enemy left behind more than eighty corpses and fled. The news of the victory quickly spread to the celebration conference. The hall was filled with thunderous applause. Li Jingsheng was finishing his report. He said: "The Party and the superiors' usual leadership and education have given us the determination and courage to defend the tunnel for ten days and ten nights, achieving the final victory. Our ten days and ten nights of fighting in the tunnel show our Volunteers' determination to fight the enemy to the end tenaciously and unyieldingly for the motherland and the Korean people. If the enemy dares to launch an attack again, then, besides getting their heads bashed in, they will get nothing."

    十天十夜的坑道战
    新华社特约通讯员  韦明
    六月中旬，中线金城的左前方，志愿军某部的前沿部队守卫着阵地。
    第一排副排长何家胜、第一班班长覃贵华和第七班班长李经盛带领着第一班的战士和第七班的四个战士，在击退敌人许多次的进攻，杀伤敌人五百多名以后，转移到附近坑道工事中据守，准备继续杀伤敌人，待机配合主力反击。
    这时，何家胜、覃贵华和几个战士已经负了伤，但是，他们仍英勇地坚持着。十五个勇士转入了坑道，对占领了山头野战工事的敌人来说，好像是坐在随时会爆发的火山头上。
    坑道工事修筑在山腰里，是志愿军战士们日日夜夜用洋镐和铁锤穿凿成的。十五位勇士转入坑道后，七班长、共产党员李经盛就布置了几个火力点。他要头部负伤的战士杨政风守着一个火力点；战士龚长安和额上负伤的王启培守着另一个火力点；他又叫炊事员吴振海和机枪弹药手贾高带着冲锋枪扼守右面的火力点。每布置一个地方，李经盛就坚定地告诉他们：“坚决守住，不让敌人接近一步！要节约子弹，准备反击敌人！”有三个敌人很快地从右边搜索过来，炊事员吴振海猛扣扳机扫倒了他们。敌人不断到洞口来拉他们的伤员和拖死尸。吴振海和贾高就用交叉火力同时猛扫，又打死了二十多个敌人。最后，敌人不得不让死尸和伤员留在坑道前面，再不敢走近坑道一步了。
    但是，勇士们面前摆着严重的困难。他们仅有二千发左右的子弹，一箱压缩干粮和一小箱饼干。坑道里没有水。口渴时，只能用舌头舐舐干裂的嘴唇，或吮吸着潮湿的石头。肚子饿极了，但没有水，干粮和饼干都咽不下去。就在这样困难的情况下，他们白天紧张地抗击着敌人的进攻，夜晚，又到洞口去紧张地等待配合主力部队反击。他们知道：坚守下去就是胜利。四川籍的青年战士汤先富和王启培在站哨后休息时就聊起家乡来，有时还唱几句四川小调。负重伤的青年团员覃贵华还不时用干嘶的声音唱广东小调。在洞内警戒的哨兵一听见我们的炮弹在山顶敌人阵地上爆炸，就赶快把这个鼓舞人心的消息告诉大家。
    副排长、共产党员何家胜伤势稍轻一些，继续执行着他的指挥任务，鼓励战士们坚持作战，准备反击，并委托李经盛去具体安排。李经盛一刻不停地放哨查岗，照顾伤员，擦枪压子弹，并且研究如何配合主力部队反击敌人。坑道上面山顶上，敌人有一挺重机枪正对着我反击部队进攻的方向，李经盛就计划着在反击时冲出坑道夺取这挺重机枪。有时，他还爬到河口向敌人的机枪工事丢手榴弹。他忍受着口渴和饥饿，鼓励大家说：“艰苦就是光荣，只要忍受这些艰苦，坚持到主力部队反击，我们就会胜利！共产党员的本领就在于在最艰苦的时候能带领大家克服困难！”他的模范行动鼓舞了所有的战士，增加了他们克服困难的信心和力量。
    坚持到第四天，何家胜、李经盛和一个负伤的共产党员张长明召开党的小组会，研究目前的情况和党员的任务。会后，又集合战士们开大会，何家胜和李经盛鼓励大家坚持下去，并且宣布了配合部队反击时的作战计划。会上，炊事员吴振海和战士贾高自动要求到被敌人占据着的伙房中去取水喝。于是大家就商量好如何去取水。第六天，贾高由冲锋枪手掩护着，冲到伙房，取回了一桶水。这样才解了大家六天六夜的干渴。第二天，吴振海又取回了三桶水，他们一面喝着水，一面分吃了一点干粮，继续坚持战斗。
    十七日夜晚，何家胜、李经盛又研究了情况，决定派一部分同志突围回部队报告情况，以便配合作战。他们约好了联系的信号。当夜，吴振海和王启培带着三个伤员突围出去了。
    十八日早晨，王启培已经坐在营的前线指挥所里了。营长听了王启培的报告后激动地说：“你们是祖国人民的好儿子，顽强坚定的好战士。今夜我们准备反击原七班的阵地。你再带一个班进坑道去，坚持到反击。”
    夜半以后，王启培带着副连长和一个班的战士朝坑道的方向摸索前进。他们和李经盛及留下来的勇士在黑暗中会合了。战士们兴奋得流下了热泪。李经盛和副连长紧紧地握着手。他的脸上刚才被敌人的炮弹炸伤了，还在流着血。但是他仍要求和副连长等一道坚持下去。副连长坚决命令他带着伤员先回部队休息，自己带领其余的战士坚守坑道。
    李经盛回到自己的阵地，就被师首长请到指挥所里。他们受到师首长亲切的慰问。李经盛代表坚守坑道的英雄们参加了正在进行的全师庆功大会。他佩着当地朝鲜妇女代表献的大红花，向到会代表报告了他们坚守坑道的战斗情形。
    正在这时，我军向敌人发起了猛烈的反击。强烈的炮火轰击着敌人的阵地。坚守在坑道里的战士们紧张地提着枪，拿着手榴弹，站在坑道口准备出击。年青的战士们，随着炮的轰隆声轻轻地唱起歌来。炮火一停，反击部队攻上山来，坚守在坑道里的战士们迅速地夺下了山顶上敌人的那挺机关枪。由于坑道里的勇士们的密切配合，我军反击部队仅仅十分钟就结束了战斗。敌人丢下了八十多具尸体逃走了。胜利的消息迅速地传到庆功大会上。会场里掌声如雷。李经盛正在结束他的报告。他说：“党和上级平时领导、教育，使我们有决心、有勇气坚守坑道十天十夜，取得了最后胜利。我们在坑道里十天十夜的战斗，表示了我们志愿军为了祖国和朝鲜人民，而顽强不屈地坚决和敌人斗争到底的决心。敌人如果再敢发动进攻的话，那么，除了碰得头破血流以外，它是什么也得不到的。”
