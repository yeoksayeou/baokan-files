The Hebei Provincial Trust Company, due to serious bureaucratic practices, neglected the lives and safety of workers when hiring porters from Baoding City to transport asphalt. It failed to make adequate preparations for preventing poisoning, resulting in a severe incident of fifty-nine workers being poisoned (Note: This matter was exposed in a letter from reader Wang Guilin and others, originally published in the "Letters from Readers" column on the 6th of this month). After receiving instructions from the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the North China Administrative Council to thoroughly investigate this incident, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government immediately decided to have the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Supervisory Committee of the Provincial People's Government, the Provincial Labor Bureau, the Commercial Department, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Trust Company, and the Transport Company, along with relevant departments in Baoding City, investigate the incident’s process and causes. Now, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government have respectively given Party disciplinary and administrative punishments to those responsible for the errors. Through this incident, they will launch a widespread struggle against bureaucracy throughout the province, continue to expose similar problems, and educate the vast number of cadres.

According to the investigation report of the relevant Hebei provincial authorities, the course of this incident is as follows:

The Hebei Provincial Trust Company, entrusted by the Construction Company, purchased 60,000 jin of asphalt (including 35,000 jin of hard asphalt) in Shijiazhuang City. On June 10th, the deputy manager of the Shijiazhuang City Trust Company telephoned the provincial Trust Company to report that the asphalt had been purchased and stated that the asphalt was poisonous, a dangerous item, and that the stevedores should be informed during transport. Han Ying, a clerk in the provincial company, received the call and told Wang Dafang, the head of the Building Materials Section and concurrently the Storage and Transportation Section. On the 11th, Wang Dafang told Fan Xiven, the warehouse负责人, to prepare for receiving the asphalt, but did not give specific instructions. Fan Xiven convened a warehouse cadre meeting the next morning to make arrangements, which were similarly unspecific, only tasking storekeeper Li Hui with receiving the goods and contacting the station. When contacting the station, Li Hui only asked if the goods had arrived and did not state that the asphalt was poisonous. When requesting workers from the stevedore union, he also did not state that they were transporting poisonous asphalt. On the 13th, when the Shijiazhuang City Trust Company loaded the asphalt, it telegraphed the provincial company to prepare to organize workers to unload the truck. After Wang Dafang received the call, he notified warehouse cadre Zhao Fuxing to tell Fan Xiven to discuss with the stevedore union and make preparations for preventing poisoning; however, his starting point was not to protect the workers' lives, but he was afraid of being punished for accidents. On the 14th, the asphalt arrived in Baoding with a statement for the provincial company. Li Wenbin of the company immediately sent someone to deliver it to warehouse accountant Nie Yingcai and told Nie Yingcai to be sure to read the statement. Later, Li Wenbin telephoned Nie Yingcai to inform him that the asphalt had arrived and to prepare for transport, and to explain the toxicity and danger of the asphalt to the workers. However, Nie Yingcai only gave the statement to Zhao Fuxing, asking him to read it, and did not tell him about the information from the telephone call. Zhao Fuxing also did not read the statement and put it in the drawer. After the asphalt arrived at the station, it was unloaded by station workers. On the 15th, Zhao Fuxing consulted with the First Team of the Stevedore Union about transporting the asphalt, and also did not state that the asphalt was poisonous. When workers asked him, "What is this stuff? What is it used for?" He replied, "Probably stinky oil, used for repairing roads." When stacking, Li Wenbin told Li Hui to explain the dangers of the asphalt to the workers and make preparations for preventing poisoning. But Li Hui said, "If I tell the workers, will they still transport it?" When workers asked him if it was asphalt, he lied and said it was stinky oil, not poisonous, and "guaranteed" not to deceive the workers. However, when receiving the goods, he was afraid of being poisoned and did not inspect the goods himself, asking someone else to do it for him. Because of the serious irresponsibility of the company's staff and the extremely bad deceptive tactics they employed, 59 people were poisoned (11 station workers, 2 severely; 46 from the stevedore union, 3 severely; and 2 from the provincial trust company).

After this incident occurred, the Commercial Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Trust Company carried out rescue treatment and went to console the injured workers and their families. After six days of treatment and recuperation, all workers have resumed work. The medical expenses and wages of the injured workers during the treatment period will be fully borne by the Provincial Trust Company.

From the above facts, it can be seen that the nature of this incident is extremely serious. The Provincial Trust Company treated workers with a bourgeois viewpoint and played with the lives of workers. This is not only a serious bureaucratic style of work, but also dereliction of duty and illegal conduct. In particular, the fact that this happened after the "Three-Anti" movement is even more serious. In order to enforce Party discipline and the law, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government decided to give the following personnel Party disciplinary and administrative punishments respectively:

Wang Dafang (Party member), head of the Building Materials Section and concurrently the Storage and Transportation Section, did not pay enough attention to major issues related to the safety of workers' lives. His work arrangements were neither specific nor thorough; he did not check after making arrangements, nor did he report to higher authorities. When relevant Hebei provincial authorities went to inspect, he also said, "I'm busy with work, I can't take care of these small things"; and said that he "had done most of the work," attempting to shirk responsibility, demonstrating serious bureaucracy and lack of organization and discipline. Wang Dafang should be held primarily responsible for this incident and it was decided to give him the administrative punishment of dismissal and the Party punishment of removal from work.

Fan Xiven (Party member), warehouse负责人, not only did not personally take charge of handling this important issue related to the safety of workers' lives, but also made incomplete and unspecific work arrangements, and did not check afterwards. What is more serious is that he knew that the asphalt had arrived on the afternoon of the 14th, but did not ask about it, and did not go to work the next day (Sunday), which is an act of dereliction of duty. Fan Xiven should be held directly responsible for this incident and it was decided to give him the administrative punishment of dismissal and the Party punishment of probation within the Party for six months.

Li Hui, the storekeeper, was responsible for actually receiving the goods, but he did not implement the instructions of his superiors, played with people's lives, and deceived the workers, which is a serious illegal act and the most direct person responsible for the incident. It was decided to give him the punishment of dismissal and prosecution.

Accountant Nie Yingcai's irresponsible behavior was very serious. He received the phone call twice. The first time, he did not convey the message at all; the second time, he only said it carelessly. He did not read the statement when he received it, nor did he give a detailed explanation. What is more serious is that because he had opinions about Fan Xiven and Li Hui, he mistakenly thought that it was not his business if something went wrong, causing personal anger. It was decided to give him the punishment of dismissal.

Storekeeper Zhao Fuxing did not read the statement and did not have enough knowledge of the toxicity of asphalt, and did not explain it to the workers. Although he was also poisoned (mildly), the occurrence of this incident is related to his careless and bureaucratic style of work, so he should make a profound review and be given a severe criticism.

Deputy Managers Xu Ming and Wang Nuofeng have serious bureaucracy. Although the company has undergone the "Three-Anti" movement, it still lacks or has no strict working system at all. They do not check the work of their subordinates, and their subordinates do not report to them, so they never knew about such an important matter. Both of them should be severely criticized and make profound reviews.

Han Ying and Li Wenbin behaved more responsibly in this incident and it was decided to commend them.

    河北省信托公司造成工人中毒事件
    犯有官僚主义错误的人员受到严格处分
    河北省信托公司因为存在着严重的官僚主义作风，在雇用保定市搬运工人搬运沥青时，忽视工人的生命安全，没有作好防毒的准备工作，以致发生了五十九人中毒的严重事件（按：此事曾由读者王桂林等来信揭发，原信刊本月六日“读者来信”栏）。中共河北省委会和河北省人民政府接到中共中央华北局和华北行政委员会关于彻查这一事件的指示后，立即决定由中共河北省委会纪律检查委员会、省人民政府监察委员会、省劳动局、商业厅、省总工会、信托公司、搬运公司等单位协同保定市各有关部门，彻查这一事件发生的经过及其原因。现在，中共河北省委会和河北省人民政府已分别给予犯错误的人员以党内处分和行政处分；并将通过这
    一事件，在全省普遍展开反对官僚主义的斗争，继续揭发类似的问题，借以教育广大干部。
    根据河北省上述有关机关的检查报告，这一事件发生的经过如下：
    河北省信托公司受建筑公司的委托，在石家庄市购买了六万斤沥青（内有硬沥青三万五千斤）。六月十日，石家庄市信托公司副经理向省信托公司电话报告沥青已购妥，并说明沥青有毒，是危险品，在搬运时应向搬运工会说明。省公司科员韩英接电话后，便把这一情况告诉了建材科兼储运科科长王大方。十一日，王大方将这一情况告诉了仓库负责人范锡文，让他做好接收沥青的准备工作，但未作具体指示。范锡文在次日晨召开仓库干部会作了布置，同样很不具体，只责成管库员李惠负责收货并和车站联系。李惠在和车站联系时，只问货是否到了，未说明沥青有毒。在向搬运工会要工人时，他也未说明是搬运含有毒性的沥青。十三日，石家庄市信托公司装运沥青时，又电告省公司准备组织工人卸车。王大方接电话后，曾通知仓库干部赵福兴转告范锡文，要他和搬运工会谈好，作防毒准备；但他的出发点不是为了保护工人的生命安全，而是恐怕因发生事故受罚。十四日，沥青运到保定，附有给省公司的说明书。该公司李文斌当即派人送给仓库会计聂英才，并告聂英才一定要看说明书。随后李文斌又电话通知聂英才沥青已到，要他作好搬运的准备工作，并向工人讲明沥青的毒性和危险性。但聂英才只将说明书交给了赵福兴，要他看一看，未将电话上所谈的情况告诉他。赵福兴也没有看说明书，便把说明书放在抽屉内。沥青到站后，由车站工人将货卸下。十五日，赵福兴到搬运工会一中队商量搬运沥青，也未说明沥青有毒。在搬运时工人问他：“这是什么东西？干什么用的？”他答说：“大概是臭油，修马路用的。”在装垛时，李文斌曾告诉李惠，要他向工人说明沥青的危险性，并作防毒准备。但李惠却说：“如果告诉工人，工人还给搬吗？”工人问他是否沥青，他便撒谎说是臭油，没毒，并“保证”不欺骗工人。可是在收货时，他却怕中毒而不去检验货物，叫别人代替他去做。由于该公司工作人员这样严重的不负责任，并采取了极端恶劣的欺骗手段，因而先后中毒者有五十九人（车站工人十一人，较重者二人；搬运工会四十六人，最重者三人；省信托公司二人）。
    这一事件发生后，河北省人民政府商业厅和信托公司作了抢救治疗，并前往慰问受伤工人及其家属。经过六天的医治和休养，工人已全部复工，医药费和受伤工人治疗期间的工资，决定由省信托公司全部负担。
    从以上的事实可以看出，这一事件的性质是极端严重的。省信托公司用资产阶级的观点看待工人，玩忽工人的生命，这不但是严重的官僚主义作风，而且是失职和违法行为。特别是这件事发生在“三反”运动以后，更是十分严重的。为了严肃党纪和法纪，中共河北省委会和河北省人民政府决定分别给下列人员以党纪和行政处分：
    建材科兼储运科长王大方（党员）对有关工人生命安全的重大问题，未给予足够的注意。他的工作布置，既不具体，又不周密；布置后又不检查，也未向上级作报告。当河北省各有关机关前去检查时，他还说什么“工作忙，这些小事情照顾不到”；又说自己“已将工作作了一大半”，企图以此推脱责任，表现了严重的官僚主义和无组织无纪律。王大方对此事件应负主要责任，决定行政上给以撤职处分，党内给以撤消工作的处分。
    仓库负责人范锡文（党员）对此有关工人生命安全的重大问题，不但不亲自掌握处理，而且布置工作不周密、不具体，事后又不检查。更严重的是十四日下午明知沥青已到，也不过问，第二天（星期日）上午又不上班，是一种渎职行为。范锡文对这一事件应负直接的责任，决定行政上给以撤职，党内给以留党察看半年的处分。
    管库员李惠负实际接收货物的责任，但他不执行上级的指示，玩忽人命，欺骗工人，是一种严重的违法行为，也是事件的最直接的负责人，决定给以撤职法办的处分。
    会计聂英才不负责任的行为十分严重，两次接电话，第一次根本不传达，第二次仅马虎地说了一下，接到说明书不看，也不作详细交代。更严重的是因为他对范锡文、李惠有意见，便错误地认为此事作错了也和自己无关，闹个人意气，决定给以撤职处分。
    管库员赵福兴不看说明书，对沥青毒性认识不足，未向工人说明。他虽然也中了毒（较轻），但这一事件的发生，和他的粗枝大叶的官僚主义作风有关，因此应作深刻检讨，并给以严格批评。
    正、副经理许明、王诺锋有严重的官僚主义。该公司虽经过“三反”运动，仍然缺乏或根本没有严格的工作制度。他们不检查下级的工作，下级也不向他们作报告，因而对这样重大的事情始终不知道。他们两人应受到严格批评，并作深刻检讨。
    韩英、李文斌在这一事件中表现得较负责任，决定予以表扬。
