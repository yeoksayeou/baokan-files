    Examining Staff Based on Work Performance
    On May 8th, the Soviet "Izvestia" published an editorial entitled "Examining Staff Based on Work Performance." Here is an abstract:
    The enormous scale of communist construction places new and higher demands on the leaders of local Soviet organs. The resolution of all the complex and diverse tasks facing the local Soviets depends on the work level of the leaders. Therefore, it is necessary to maximize the political quality and professional level of Soviet cadres.
    The most important method of educating cadres is to deeply and systematically examine them to see how they are actually implementing the instructions of the Party and the government in their daily practical work, how much initiative and perseverance they demonstrate in achieving established goals, and how they overcome difficulties and eliminate shortcomings.
    "To examine staff," Comrade Stalin instructed, "means to examine them not according to their promises and declarations, but according to the results of their work.
    To check on the implementation of tasks means to check not only in the office, not only according to formalistic summaries, but first and foremost at the work site, according to the actual results of implementation."
    Studying people comprehensively at the work site allows for the most accurate assessment of their abilities, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each worker, so that they can maximize their usefulness.
    Recently, many executive committees of Soviets have begun to more frequently examine the work of their subordinate Soviet organs, enterprises, collective farms, institutions, as well as their own departments, bureaus, and staff.
    Unfortunately, this important method of educating cadres based on work results has not yet been adequately adopted in the regular practice of all local Soviets.
    Tolerating shortcomings and treating those who fail to complete tasks with a liberal attitude prevents the Kirov Oblast from fully utilizing potential conditions to accelerate the improvement of industry and agriculture, to provide cities and villages with comprehensive facilities, and to improve the cultural life of the working people.
    Some executive committees of provincial and district Soviets and their departments and bureaus only check the work of the leaders of enterprises or institutions when those leaders are clearly unable to fulfill the assigned tasks and disrupt the completion of plans. It is very clear that it is necessary to regularly familiarize oneself with the work of local leaders so that they can be promptly pointed out their shortcomings and errors can be prevented.
    It is necessary to combine systematic review of cadres from the leading organs, from above, with review from below. Review from below, as Comrade Stalin instructed, involves the participation of the masses, where the led review the leaders, pointing out their mistakes and prescribing methods for correcting them.
    It should be pointed out that in some Soviet organs, perceptions of this or that staff member are sometimes based solely on active and eloquent speeches at various meetings.
    The deplorable policy of transferring cadres who are unable to handle one job to another, no less responsible position, has not yet been completely eradicated. In Tbilisi, Comrade Gogua was transferred from one important position to another within a few years. Here, as before, he is unable to fulfill the tasks assigned to him.
    Widely developing criticism and self-criticism is a necessary condition for correctly educating cadres and improving the work style and methods of the organs. Unexacting demands and a tolerant attitude towards the shortcomings and mistakes of individual leaders will bring great harm to the common cause and the workers themselves. One should not spare the self-esteem of cadres, but openly and bravely expose their errors and shortcomings, and point out the paths for correcting them.
    Special attention should be paid to the education of young Soviet cadres. As a result of the recent elections of local workers' representatives' Soviets, many new people have joined the leadership work of the Soviets. It is necessary to treat young Soviet workers with care, systematically provide them with concrete assistance, improve their professional skills, and teach them the art of leadership in practice.
    Examining cadres based on work performance, and constantly caring for the intellectual and professional improvement of Soviet staff, is one of the main conditions for the successful work of local Soviets in implementing economic and cultural construction plans.

    Labor Education for Young Pioneers and Students
    The seventh issue of the Soviet magazine "Young Bolshevik" published an article by Krikova, Secretary of the Rostov Oblast Committee of the Soviet Lenin Young Communist League, discussing the labor education conducted by the Oblast's Young Pioneer organizations for Young Pioneers and students. Here is an abstract:
    The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Central Committee of the All-Union Lenin Young Communist League, in their resolutions on schools and Young Pioneer organizations, attach great importance to enabling Young Pioneers and students to engage in socially useful labor. These resolutions emphasize that such labor, within their capabilities, should be subordinate to the purpose of school teaching, and at the same time, students should not be overburdened in terms of labor.
    The methods by which the various brigades of the Young Pioneers are promoting labor education for students are diverse, including assistance to schools and participation in large-scale undertakings of national significance, such as Stalin's Plan for the Transformation of Nature and the Great Communist Construction Projects. In accordance with the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Lenin Young Communist League, the Rostov Oblast's Communist Youth League organizations are striving to take into account the individual characteristics, interests, and ages of students when conducting labor education for them.
    In the various schools of the Oblast, increasing attention is being paid to establishing various technical groups, such as electrical engineering, aviation modeling, radio engineering, and shipbuilding modeling groups. The activities of these groups will help students consolidate the knowledge they have gained in the classroom, develop students' interest in technical research, and cultivate their habit of reading independently and working independently in laboratories or laboratories.
    The Young Pioneers in the Oblast are actively participating in the work of radioing schools and establishing school radio stations. Last year, under the leadership of physics teachers, Young Pioneers and students established twenty-four radio stations.
    Aviation modeling is most loved by Young Pioneers and students. It has become our custom to hold aviation modeling competitions between districts, cities, and the Oblast.
    In many rural Young Pioneer brigades, there are tractor, automobile, and motorcycle research groups. In addition, the work of young natural scientist groups plays a huge role in conducting labor education for Young Pioneers and students.
    Caring for school libraries is one of the most important social undertakings of Young Pioneers. The small and medium teams of Young Pioneers in the Oblast often help librarians organize book catalogs, compile book introduction lists, and repair and bind books.
    Young Pioneers and students in rural areas often help collective farms and state farms with agricultural operations. They accumulate snow and manure in winter, and mow grass, fight crop pests, thresh grain, transport grain from combine harvesters, and harvest vegetables in summer.
    However, there are still serious shortcomings in organizing Young Pioneers and students to engage in socially beneficial labor. The Oblast, municipal, and district committees of the Communist Youth League and the national education organs have not been able to well supervise the work of correctly organizing children's labor. This children's labor
    must be combined with healthy rest.
    The family plays a huge role in the labor education of Young Pioneers. The Communist Youth League organizations in the Oblast often help teachers and instructors establish close ties with families, jointly solve communist education problems, and attract parents to actively participate in the education of Young Pioneers and students. Young Pioneer organizations should also educate children to help their parents with housework and care for their younger siblings.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    依据工作成绩审查工作人员
    五月八日苏联“消息报”发表以“依据工作成绩审查工作人员”为题的社论，摘要如下：
    共产主义建设的巨大规模，向地方苏维埃机关的领导者提出新的、更高的要求。摆在地方苏维埃面前的一切复杂而多样性的任务的解决，有赖于领导者的工作水平。所以，必须尽量提高苏维埃干部的政治质量和业务水平。
    教育干部的最重要方法，是要深刻而系统地审查他们，看他们在日常的实际工作中实际地对党和政府的指示贯彻得怎么样，在达到既定的目标时所表现的主动精神和坚毅性如何，如何克服困难，消灭缺点。
    “审查工作人员，——斯大林同志指示说，——这是说，不是按照他们的诺言和宣言，而是根据他们的工作结果来审查他们。
    检查任务执行的情况，这就是说，不仅是在办公室里，不仅只根据公式主义的总结来检查，而首先要在工作地点根据执行的实际结果来检查。”
    在工作地点全面地研究人，可以最正确地判断他们的能力，了解每一个工作者的长处和弱点，以便他能最大限度地发挥他的用处。
    近来，许多苏维埃的执委会开始较为经常地审查所属苏维埃机关、企业、集体农庄、机关以及自己的各部、局和工作人员的工作。
    可惜，这种根据工作结果审查干部的教育干部的重要方法，还没有在一切地方苏维埃的经常的实践中得到应有的采用。
    容忍缺点，以自由主义的态度对待不完成任务的人，使得基洛夫省不能很好地利用可能的条件，以便更迅速地提高工业和农业，使城市和乡村有完善的设施，改善劳动人民的文化生活设备。
    有些省、区苏维埃及其各部局的执委会，只是当企业或机关的领导者显然不能担负起规定的任务，破坏了计划的完成时，才来检查这些领导人的工作。十分清楚，需要经常熟悉地方领导者的工作，这样可以及时地向工作者指出他们的缺点，防止错误发生。
    必须把从领导机关方面的、自上面的对干部的系统的审查和自下面的审查结合起来。自下面的审查，如斯大林同志所指示的，有群众参加，这时，被领导者审查领导者，指出他们的错误，规定改正错误的方法。
    应当指出，在一些苏维埃机关中，有时仅仅根据在各种会议上的积极的、漂亮的发言，而建立起对这个或那个工作人员的观念。
    把不能担当起一种工作的干部调到另一个并不少负责的工作岗位上去的恶劣的政策，至今仍没有彻底铲除。在梯比里斯，哥古瓦同志在几年内从一个重要的职务上调到另外的重要职务上。在这里，它像从前一样担负不起交给他的任务。
    广泛开展批评和自我批评，是正确教育干部、改善机关工作作风和工作方法的必要条件。不严格的要求和以宽容的态度对待个别领导者的缺点和过错，会给共同事业和工作者本人带来巨大的损害。应当不怜惜干部的自尊心，公开而勇敢地揭发他们的错误和缺点，并指出纠正错误和缺点的道路。
    对年青苏维埃干部的教育值得特别的注意。由于最近地方劳动者代表苏维埃选举的结果，许多新的人参加了苏维埃的领导工作。必须关心地对待年青的苏维埃工作者，系统地给他们以具体帮助，提高业务能力，在实践中教给他们领导的艺术。
    根据工作成绩审查干部，经常关心苏维埃工作人员的思想和业务的提高，是地方苏维埃在实现经济和文化建设计划中胜利进行工作的主要条件之一。
    少年先锋队员和学生的劳动教育
    苏联“青年布尔什维克”杂志第七期发表了苏联列宁
    共青团罗斯多夫州州委书记克里柯娃论述该州共青团组
    织对少年先锋队员和学生所进行的劳动教育，摘要如
    下：
    联共（布）中央委员会和全苏列宁共青团中央委员会在它们关于学校、关于少先队组织的决议中，非常重视使少先队员和学生从事有益于社会的劳动。这些决议强调应该使这种力能胜任的劳动服从于学校的教学的目的，同时在劳动方面不应使学生负担过重。
    少先队的各个大队所推行的对学生的劳动教育工作，其方式是各种各样的；其中包括对学校的帮助以及参加具有全国性意义的大规模的事业，如斯大林的改造自然计划和伟大的共产主义建设工程等。遵照着全苏列宁共青团中央委员会第七次全会的决议，罗斯多夫州的共青团组织正在努力争取在对学生进行劳动教育时估计到他们的个人特点、兴趣和年龄。
    在本州的各个学校中，已经逐渐更加注意于建立各种不同的技术小组：如电气工程、航空模型、无线电工程、造船模型等小组。这些小组的活动，将会帮助学生巩固他们在课堂中所获得的知识，发展学生对技术研究的兴趣，培养他们独自读书的习惯和在研究室或实验室中独立工作的习惯。
    本州的少先队员们正在积极地参加使学校无线电化和建立学校无线电分站的工作。去年在物理教师们的领导下，少先队员和学生们曾建立了二十四个无线电分站。
    航空模型最受到少先队员们和学生们的爱好。在各区、市和州之间进行航空模型比赛已成为我们的惯例。
    在很多农村少先队大队中，都有拖拉机、汽车和摩托车研究小组。此外，在对少先队员和学生进行劳动教育时，少年自然科学家小组的工作，也有巨大的作用。
    关怀学校图书馆是少先队员们的最重要的社会事业之一。本州各个少先队的小队和中队常帮助图书馆管理员整理图书目录，编制书籍介绍表并修补和装订书籍。
    农村中的少先队员和学生们常帮助集体农场和国家农场从事农业操作。他们在冬天积雪、积肥，在夏天则从事割草、对农作物害虫进行斗争、打谷，从联合收割机上运走谷物和收割蔬菜等工作。
    但是在组织少先队员和学生从事有益社会的劳动的工作中，仍存有严重缺点。本州共青团的州委、市委和区委员会与国民教育机关还没有能很好地对正确组织儿童劳动的工作加以监督。这种儿童劳动
    一定应和有益于健康的休息相配合。
    在对少先队员的劳动教育中，家庭起着极大的作用。本州的共青团组织常帮助教师和辅导员与各个家庭建立密切联系，共同解决共产主义教育问题，并吸引家长们积极参加对少先队员和学生的教育工作。少先队组织也应当教育孩子们在家务上帮助父母亲，并关心自己的小弟弟和小妹妹。
