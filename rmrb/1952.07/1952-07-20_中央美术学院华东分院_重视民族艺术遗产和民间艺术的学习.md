To the Editor:
    Through ideological self-criticism, the faculty and students of our Central Academy of Fine Arts East China Branch have realized that our school did not pay enough attention to national forms in the past. On the contrary, many people still blindly worship Western bourgeois art. For example, in coloring last year's creations, teachers did not follow the school's regulations to emphasize single-line flat coloring techniques. This is a manifestation of bourgeois artistic thought that belittles the national art tradition. These points have been clarified in this ideological self-criticism, and the study of national heritage and folk art has begun to be emphasized. For example, in the past, when we drew sketches, we completely adopted Western charcoal drawing, focusing on light and dark. Now we are starting to pay attention to line drawing. Following this, the school's research department established a "National Art Heritage Research Office," whose task is to collect materials related to the national art heritage, display them regularly, and help teachers and students study the national art heritage. The progress of this work has greatly strengthened the atmosphere of national art heritage research in our school.
    Through this ideological self-criticism, folk art has also become an object of our enthusiastic study. For example, the students of the sculpture department used to be only fascinated by large sculptures and monuments, but we did not pay attention to the Wuxi clay figurines, which are very popular among the masses and have considerable sales. This time, the sculpture department organized a group to go directly to Wuxi to conduct investigations and research, and brought a batch of small, ideologically-oriented sculptures and portraits. They stayed in Wuxi for five days and held a symposium with folk artists. This can be said to be an excellent exchange of experience between our school's sculpture and folk sculpture, and both sides gained a lot. After this work, our school established regular contact with the folk artists who make clay figurines in Wuxi. According to their investigation, there are currently more than 400 families in Wuxi who directly or indirectly rely on clay figurine making for their livelihood. The sales of clay figurines reach as far as Dalian and Harbin, with the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River being the main market. According to research, the main problems they currently face are: first, the lack of ideological leadership; second, the problem of expanding sales. If these problems are solved, the future of Wuxi clay figurine art is limitless. This is because with the basic completion of the national land reform movement, farmers will further demand cultural satisfaction, which is inevitable. During the New Year, farmers and children like to buy one or two clay figurines to display at home.
    The small clay figurines made by our school in connection with the current movement (such as resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing American bacteriological warfare, etc.), after being displayed in Hangzhou, were greatly loved by the masses, which gave great encouragement to the popularization of small clay figurine production by the students, and their confidence was also improved.
    Now we all clearly realize that our new art must correctly inherit its own national tradition and develop on this basis. Only in this way can it have a great future.

    中央美术学院华东分院
    重视民族艺术遗产和民间艺术的学习
    编辑同志：我们中央美术学院华东分院师生通过思想检查，认识了我们学校过去对民族形式是不够重视的。相反的，对西洋资产阶级美术，还有不少人存在着盲目崇拜的态度。如去年在创作的着色方面，教师们便没有依照学校的规定，讲求单线平涂的画法。这是一种轻视民族艺术传统的资产阶级艺术思想的表现。这些在这次思想检查中明确了，同时对民族遗产和民间艺术的学习，开始被重视起来。如从前我们画素描，完全采用西洋的木炭画，讲究明暗，现在则开始注重线描。跟着我校研究部便成立了“民族艺术遗产研究室”，其任务便是收集有关民族艺术遗产的资料，经常陈列，并帮助师生研究民族艺术遗产。这个工作的进行，大大地加强了我们学校对民族艺术遗产研究的气氛。
    通过这次思想检查，民间艺术也成为我们热烈学习的对象。如雕塑系的同学，过去只是醉心于大的雕刻和纪念碑，可是，像很受群众欢迎，销路相当广的无锡泥人，我们却不去注意。这次雕塑系组织了小组，直接到无锡去进行调查和研究工作，并带去一批小型的具有思想性的雕塑和头像。他们在无锡住了五天，同民间艺人开过座谈会。这可以说是我们学校的雕塑和民间雕塑一次极好的经验交流，双方都得到很大收获。经过这次工作，我们学校和无锡做泥人的民间艺人建立了经常性的联系。根据他们的调查，目前无锡直接和间接依靠塑泥人为生的，就有四百余家，泥人的销路远达大连、哈尔滨等地，长江下游诸省尤为主要的市场。据研究，他们目前存在的主要问题：第一是缺乏思想的领导；第二便是扩大销路问题。要是这些问题得到解决，无锡泥人艺术的前途是无限的。因为随着全国土地改革运动的基本完成，农民将进一步要求得到文化上的满足，这是必然的。过新年时，农民和孩子们，都喜欢买一两个泥人在家里摆摆。
    我们学校结合当前运动（如抗美援朝、反对美国细菌战等）所做的小型泥人，在杭州市内陈列后，便获得群众极大的喜爱，这对同学制作小型泥人的普及工作，给予极大的鼓励，信心也提高了。
    现在我们都明确地认识到，我们的新美术必须要正确地继承自己的民族传统并在这个基础上发展，这样，才能有它伟大的前途。
