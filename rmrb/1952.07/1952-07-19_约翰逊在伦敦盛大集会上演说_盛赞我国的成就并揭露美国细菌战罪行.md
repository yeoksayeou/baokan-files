Xinhua News Agency, London, July 17th: TASS, London, July 16th: The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, delivered a speech at a grand gathering organized by the Britain-China Friendship Association on the evening of the 16th. Before the meeting began, thousands of London citizens had gathered at the St. Pancras Town Hall. Approximately two thousand people were unable to enter the venue.

Johnson stepped onto the podium amidst applause and cheers from the attendees. He spoke about the enormous changes in the lives of the Chinese people since the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. He compared what he saw this time with what he saw during his first visit to China in 1932. Johnson said: The achievements made by the Chinese people in the past few years are the result of the Chinese people's liberation from the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime and the shackles of the landlords. Johnson emphasized: The entire Chinese people desire peace and to be friendly with the people of all countries. He spoke about the great peaceful construction work being carried out in China, saying: The huge irrigation and water control projects undertaken by the Central People's Government have freed the Chinese people from the constant threat of floods and famine. Like the Soviet people, the Chinese people are also engaged in afforestation and changing the climate of their country.

Johnson emphasized the importance of British trade with China, saying, "For our country, it is an unlimited market! If we trade with the 800 million people from Prague to Beijing who need our goods, we will no longer have to ask the United States for money."

In his speech, Johnson spoke about the crimes of the United States in using bacteriological weapons. He read out several documents signed and published by Chinese scientific and cultural workers and religious figures, which irrefutably proved that the United States used this heinous weapon of mass slaughter. Johnson spoke about the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross, saying, "The Swiss Committee of the Red Cross cannot be trusted. It investigated Nazi concentration camps and said the conditions in the Nazi concentration camps were good. In South Korea, the Red Cross representatives wore American military uniforms and obeyed American laws."

Johnson's speech was frequently interrupted by cheers from the audience. Johnson concluded by saying, "China is a great and vibrant country. It has no fear for the future. It believes it will be able to defeat bacteriological warfare, this evil thing."

After Johnson finished speaking, the entire audience cheered enthusiastically.

Mrs. Johnson spoke to the people attending the meeting. She talked about the equal rights enjoyed by Chinese women and the active participation of Chinese women in the struggle for a happy future. Mrs. Johnson called on women from all over the world to unite and fight together to strive for peace and prevent another war.

When Dean Johnson and his wife walked out of the St. Pancras Town Hall, the two thousand or so people who had been unable to enter the venue enthusiastically cheered them.

    约翰逊在伦敦盛大集会上演说
    盛赞我国的成就并揭露美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社伦敦十七日讯：英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊十六日晚在英中友好协会组织的盛大集会上发表演说。在开会以前，会场圣潘克拉斯市议厅就聚集了几千名伦敦市民。大约有两千人未能进入会场。
    约翰逊在到会者的掌声与欢呼声中登上讲台。他谈到中华人民共和国中央人民政府执政以来中国人民生活的巨大变化。他把他这次看到的情况和他在一九三二年第一次访问中国时看到的情形加以比较。约翰逊说：中国人民在过去几年内获得的成就，是中国人民从腐败的蒋介石政权和地主的枷锁下面解放出来的结果。约翰逊着重说：全中国人民都希望和平并和一切国家人民友好相处。他谈到中国正在进行的伟大的和平建设工作说：中央人民政府着手进行的巨大灌溉与治水工程，使中国人民免除了洪水与饥馑的经常威胁。中国人民和苏联人民一样，也正在从事造林和改变他们国家的气候。
    约翰逊强调英国对中国进行贸易的重要性，他说：“对于我国，那是一个无限的市场！如果我们与从布拉格到北京需要我国货物的八亿人民进行贸易，我们就不必再向美国要钱了。”
    约翰逊在演说中谈到美国使用细菌武器的罪行，他宣读了中国科学文化工作者和宗教界人士所署名发表的几项文件，这些文件都无可辩驳地证明美国使用了这种大批屠杀的凶恶武器。约翰逊谈到所谓红十字国际委员会说：“瑞士红十字会委员会是不能使人信任的。它曾经调查纳粹集中营，说纳粹集中营情况良好。在南朝鲜的红十字会代表们都穿着美军制服，服从美国的法律。”
    约翰逊的演说频频被听众的欢呼所打断，约翰逊最后说：“中国是一个伟大的朝气蓬勃的国家。它对于将来，毫无恐惧。它相信它必能击败细菌战这种万恶的东西。”
    约翰逊演说完毕以后，全体听众热烈欢呼。
    约翰逊夫人向参加大会的人们讲话。她谈到了中国妇女所享受的平等权利和中国妇女积极参加争取幸福未来的斗争的情况。约翰逊夫人号召全世界各国妇女团结起来，共同斗争，以争取和平并防止另一次战争。
    当约翰逊教长和夫人走出圣潘克拉斯市议厅的时候，未能进入会场的两千左右群众，对他们热烈欢呼。
