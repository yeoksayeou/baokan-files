    North China Agricultural Machinery Factory Rewards Advanced Producers
    Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng Attends and Presents Awards
    Beijing’s North China Agricultural Machinery Factory held an awards ceremony for advanced producers on the 7th. Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, attended and presented the awards.
    In the past six months, under the slogan of "Fighting Tigers and Production Without Delay," the factory achieved great victories on the production front. In addition to completing the tasks assigned by the state, it also increased production and saved wealth worth 21 million catties of millet. In production, 190 advanced producers and four advanced groups emerged. Four advanced working methods have been summarized: Huang Runping's warehouse management method in production management, Zhang Jingtong's working method in the woodworking shop, Jiao Xinglin's working method in the foundry, and the "Four Small" working method in the screw shop (Note: This refers to the screw-tapping working method successfully developed by four young apprentices, including Wang Baochun, in the screw shop). Due to the initial promotion of these working methods, the factory overfulfilled its production tasks.
    The awards ceremony turned into a production competition mobilization meeting. The Communist Party Branch Secretary and the Chairman of the Trade Union called on all Communist Party members and trade union members in the factory to take the lead in launching a patriotic production increase and economy campaign to create more wealth for the country.
    Minister Li Shucheng spoke after presenting the awards. He said: "The national land reform has been basically completed, and the vast number of peasant brothers urgently demand new agricultural implements. All our factory workers must further take action, respond to Chairman Mao's call, complete the production increase and economy tasks in the second half of the year, and strive to produce more high-quality and inexpensive new agricultural implements for our peasant brothers."

    华北农业机械总厂奖励先进生产者
    农业部李书城部长到场授奖
    北京华北农业机械总厂在七日举行奖励先进生产者大会，中央人民政府农业部部长李书城到场授奖。
    这个厂半年来，在“打虎生产两不误”的口号下，生产战线上取得了很大的胜利，除完成国家所给予的任务外，并增产节约价值二千一百万斤小米的财富。在生产中，涌现了一百九十个先进生产者和四个先进小组，已总结出四种先进的工作方法，这就是生产管理上的黄润萍仓库管理法、木工场张景通工作法、铸工场焦兴林工作法和螺丝场“四小”工作法（按：即为螺丝场王保存等四个青年学徒合作研究成功的套螺丝工作法）。由于初步推广了这些工作法，该厂超额完成了生产任务。
    授奖典礼变成生产竞赛动员大会。中国共产党总支书记和工会主席号召全厂共产党员、工会会员带头展开爱国增产节约竞赛运动，为国家创造更多的财富。
    李书城部长在授奖后讲话。他说：“全国土地改革已基本完成，广大农民兄弟迫切要求新式农具，我们全厂职工要进一步行动起来，响应毛主席的号召，完成下半年增产节约任务，为农民兄弟生产更多物美价廉的新农具而奋斗。”    （据新华社讯）
