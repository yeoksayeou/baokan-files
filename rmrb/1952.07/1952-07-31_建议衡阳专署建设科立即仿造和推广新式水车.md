    Suggesting the Hengyang Special District Construction Department Immediately Imitate and Promote New-Style Waterwheels
    Comrade Editor: Last year, Zeng Qingshan, a worker from Hengshan County, Hunan, created an iron "water-drawing machine," and then imitated it with wood, which was successfully tested in January of this year. The test results showed that the water output was high and rapid, capable of irrigating more than 40 mu of land per day. Irrigation utilizes water pipes, eliminating the need for manual carrying, making it very convenient. The cost is only six to seventy hundred thousand yuan. This innovation was introduced in the Yue Nan Daily. After learning of this news, farmers in Hunan wrote letters to the newspaper, requesting the government to manufacture them in large quantities to meet the needs of farmers. The Yue Nan Daily wrote to the Hengyang Special District Construction Department twice, hoping they would adopt the opinions of the masses. Later, the Hengyang Special District Construction Department replied that they had forwarded it to the Agricultural and Forestry Section of the Hengshan County People's Government for investigation and research. It has been more than half a year since then, and we have not received any news from the aforementioned two departments. Recently, Peng Wenyi from the Zhou Renliu mutual aid group in Baisha Township, Seventh District of Hengshan County, and Liu Renbiao, a member of the Yin Cai Si mutual aid group in Ping Mine Township, Ninth District, have successively manufactured single-person foot-operated waterwheels, both of which are much more efficient than the old waterwheels. Farmers are also very interested in this kind of waterwheel and hope to imitate it. However, the Hengyang Special District Construction Department has not paid attention to the new creations of the masses, nor has it actively promoted them. Therefore, I suggest that the Hengyang Special District Construction Department immediately study these creations, help with imitation, and then promote them to the masses of farmers.

    建议衡阳专署建设科立即仿造和推广新式水车
    编辑同志：去年湖南衡山县工人曾庆山创造一架铁造的“打水机”，接着又用木头仿造一架，今年一月已试验成功。试验结果，出水又多又急，每天能灌田四十多亩，灌水是利用水管，不用人抬，使用非常方便，成本只要六、七十万元。这一创造曾在岳南日报上介绍过，湖南农民们得知这一消息后，纷纷给报社写信，要求政府大量制造，供给农民需要。岳南日报曾两次写信给衡阳专署建设科，希望他们采纳群众意见，后来衡阳专署建设科来信说已转告衡山县人民政府农林科调查研究了。至今约半年余，我们也未得到上述两机关的任何音信。最近衡山县七区白沙乡周仁六互助组彭文一和九区萍矿乡尹才四互助组组员刘仁标，又相继各制造出一种单人脚踏水车，效率均比旧水车提高很多。农民对这种水车也非常感兴趣，他们希望能仿造。但衡阳专署建设科并未重视群众的新创造，也未积极予以推广。因此，我建议衡阳专署建设科立即研究这几种创造，并帮助仿造，然后推广到农民群众中去。             克顽
