    Reply Regarding Trampling Seedlings by Released Horses
    To the Editors: After reading the criticism from Comrade Cheng Wenhe, published in the People's Daily Readers' Letters column on May 20th, regarding our ranch's trampling of seedlings in the mountain closure afforestation area by released horses, we immediately conducted an investigation. We believe this criticism is correct.
    Last year, our ranch purchased a batch of new horses that did not integrate well with the herd. Due to the negligence of the herders, the horses broke away and went to a certain ditch to drink water (because there are few wells in the grassland, the ditch used to be a place for horses, cattle, sheep, and other livestock to drink). They trampled on a small portion of newly sprouted wild apricot seedlings planted by a certain forest management station (another portion was trampled by local villagers' sheep and donkeys passing by). At that time, the forest management station raised concerns with the ranch's herders, but the herders did not report it to their superiors. Due to the serious bureaucratic style of our ranch's leadership, we did not conduct thorough investigations at the grassroots level and did not adequately educate the herders, so we did not correct this mistake in a timely manner. We now sincerely accept the criticism, and we will certainly not make this kind of mistake again in the future.
    Regarding the criticism that our ranch sent people to burn lime in a certain ditch, arbitrarily felled trees, and damaged up to 500 naturally growing elm trees, this is not entirely factual. When our ranch burned lime to build a kiln in a certain location last year, we felled 47 trees after obtaining the consent and permission of the former director of the forest management station, Comrade Xu. We did not arbitrarily destroy more than 500 natural elm trees.

### 西北军区某军牧场  对放马践踏树苗的答复

    对放马践踏树苗的答复
    编辑同志：读了五月二十日人民日报读者来信栏刊登的程文鹤同志对我场在封山育林区放马践踏树苗的批评，我们立即进行检查。我们认为这个批评是正确的。
    去年我场购入一部分不合群的新马，由于牧马的同志管制疏忽，马群分股跑到某水沟饮水（因草原少井，某水沟过去是马、牛、羊等牲畜饮水的地方），把某林管所种的一小部分刚出土的山杏树苗踏坏了（另一部分是老乡的羊和毛驴来往踏坏的）。当时林管所向我场牧马的同志提出意见，但牧马的同志未向上级反映。由于我场领导方面存在严重的官僚主义作风，没有深入下层检查，对牧马的同志教育不够，所以没有及时纠正这一错误。现在我们诚恳接受批评，今后一定不再犯这类错误。
    关于批评中说我场派人在某沟内烧石灰，任意砍伐林木，破坏天然生长的山榆达五百余株，并不完全符合事实。我场去年在某地烧石灰建窑时，曾在取得林管所前主任徐同志同意和许可后，伐了四十七棵树，并没有任意破坏五百多棵天然山榆。
