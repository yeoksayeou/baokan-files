    The Gottwald Iron and Steel Works in Ostrava
    In Czechoslovakia's large-scale economic construction, the northern Ostrava industrial area occupies a very important position. It contains rich deposits of hard coal and other industrial raw materials, and many heavy industrial factories and enterprises are located there.
    The Czechoslovak people are now building Ostrava into the "steel center of the republic." The scale of this construction project can be seen from these figures: In this year alone, the soil and rocks to be excavated on the construction site will require one million trucks or five hundred thousand railroad cars for transportation; the cement required for construction will require 420 trains, bricks will require 1,150 trains, and other building materials will require 300 trains. The increase in workers needed for this construction project will exceed the population of a medium-sized city.
    The main project for the construction of Ostrava is the construction of an iron and steel plant named after Gottwald—the largest iron and steel plant in Central Europe. Its entire project will be completed by the end of 1953. However, due to the urgent need for steel materials in economic construction, the design and construction of this plant need to be carried out in a way that it can start production immediately after a part is completed. As Czechoslovakia had no surplus labor force, and many workers could not stay here for long-term work, by the middle of last year, the construction project plan for the steel plant, which was scheduled to be completed in 1951, was threatened with failure to meet the deadline. Faced with this situation, Czechoslovak Premier Zapotocky called on the people of the whole country to save labor and mobilize forces to complete this important construction task. Under the call of Comrade Zapotocky, tens of thousands of skilled workers voluntarily came from all over the country to Ostrava to participate in the construction work. With a high degree of awareness, the Czechoslovak workers worked selflessly day and night, rain or shine—some even sacrificed all their holidays. They overcame countless difficulties, enabling the 1951 project plan to be completed smoothly and on schedule.
    After that, every specific link in the Gottwald Iron and Steel Works construction project had more detailed plans and arrangements. In particular, after Comrade Lian Mianzov, a Soviet steel plant construction expert, came to the construction site of the Gottwald Iron and Steel Works, he provided very important guidance and assistance to the construction project, ensuring the smooth progress of the entire project in the future.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia and the efforts of the working class, the Gottwald Iron and Steel Works completed the first blast furnace, rolling mill, connection bridge of the blast furnace, power station, and a complex water, gas, and air supply system by the end of 1951. Seventy-two coke ovens also produced the first batch of coke on January 30 this year. The first and second Martin furnaces were also completed in early April and mid-June this year, respectively, and began to produce the first batch of steel. The second blast furnace will be completed in early October this year. Now, the various completed production sections of the Gottwald Iron and Steel Works have successively started production and will soon begin to roll steel.
    When the entire construction project is completed by the end of 1953, the Gottwald Iron and Steel Works will become one of the most modern and largest smelters in the world. Together with the output of another large project in Czechoslovakia—the "Huko" steel plant—the production volume will reach as high as two million tons per year. In this way, Czechoslovakia, with a population of only 12 million, will leap to the sixth place in the world in terms of steel production.

    俄斯特拉发的哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂
    在捷克斯洛伐克大规模的经济建设中，北部的俄斯特拉发工业区占有十分重要的地位。那里蕴藏着丰富的硬煤和其他工业原料，有许多重工业的工厂企业。
    现在捷克斯洛伐克人民正在把俄斯特拉发建设成为“共和国的钢铁中心”。这个建设工程的规模之大，可以从这些数字看出来：仅仅在今年一年内，为了进行建设而要在工地挖掘去的泥土和石块，将要用一百万辆大卡车或五十万节火车车箱来运载；而装运建设所需的水泥则要用四百二十列火车，砖块要用一千一百五十列火车，其他建筑材料要用三百列火车。这个建设工程所需要增加的工人，将高于一个中等城市的人口。
    建设俄斯特拉发的主要工程，是兴建一个以哥特瓦尔德命名的钢铁厂——中欧最大的钢铁厂。它的全部工程将在一九五三年底完成。但是由于经济建设对于钢铁材料的迫切需要，这个厂的设计和建设就需要在这种情形下进行，即完成一部分以后，就能立即使它开始生产。而捷克斯洛伐克没有剩余的劳动力，许多工人都不能长期留在这里工作，所以在去年年中的时候，预定要在一九五一年内完成的钢铁厂的建设工程计划，一度遇到了不能如期完成的威胁。面对着这种情况，捷克斯洛伐克的总理萨波托斯基向全国人民发出号召，要求全国人民节约劳动力，动员力量来完成这个重要的建设任务。在萨波托斯基同志的号召之下，成千成万的熟练工人从各地自愿地来到了俄斯特拉发参加建设工作。有着高度自觉的捷克斯洛伐克工人们，夜以继日、风雨无阻地忘我劳动着——有的人还牺牲了他们全部的休假日。他们克服了无数的困难，使得一九五一年的工程计划得以顺利地如期完成。
    此后，哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂建设工程的每一个具体环节，都有了更详细的计划和布置。尤其是苏联钢铁厂建设专家连缅左夫同志来到哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂的工地后，对建设工程作了十分重要的指导和帮助，保证了以后整个工程的顺利进行。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的领导与工人阶级的努力之下，哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂已在一九五一年底完成了第一座鼓风炉、滚压工厂、鼓风炉的连接桥、发电站和一个复杂的水、煤气和空气的供应系统。七十二个焦炭炉也在今年一月三十日生产第一批焦炭。第一座与第二座马丁炉也已分别在今年四月初和六月中竣工，开始出产了第一批钢。第二座鼓风炉将于今年十月初完工。现在哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂的各个已完成的生产部分，都已相继开工生产，并将在不久开始辗钢。
    当一九五三年底全部建设工程完工以后，哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂将成为世界上最现代化和最巨大的冶炼厂之一。它和捷克斯洛伐克另一个大工程——“胡科”炼钢厂的生产量加在一起，将高达每年二百万吨的数字。这样，人口仅一千二百万的捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量，就飞跃居于世界的第六位。
