    Travelogue of My Hometown
    Soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, Hua Chen
    The westbound train on the Longhai Railway sped along like a whirlwind, with Minquan Station not far ahead. My hometown, Suixian County, Henan, which I had been away from for more than eight years, was rapidly approaching. Outside the train window was a golden sea of wheat, with small red flags fluttering in the wheat sea. A dark crowd of people were busy harvesting near the red flags, with songs and laughter constantly flying from the crowd. After learning the situation, a fellow passenger said: "The red flags are the flags of the mutual aid teams. The peasants are competing to harvest." I never imagined that "red flag," "mutual aid team," "competition," and other terms representing a happy life would now be connected with my disaster-ridden hometown!
    Speaking of disasters, my memory was pulled back to eight years ago. At that time, I was leaving my hometown for the first time because I was joining the revolution, and I took a train east from Minquan Station. Wasn't it exactly this area? Weren't they the fields and villages outside the train window? It was the season of bright spring at that time, but it was difficult to see a single person in the fields or villages. Nine out of ten houses in the village were closed, and people had eaten all the tree bark and wild vegetables. Those who hadn't starved to death had mostly fled to the liberated areas. At that time, the roofs of the eastbound trains were crowded with people fleeing famine and doing small business. If one didn't bribe the Japanese devils and traitors, one would be beaten severely or even pushed off the train. It was also in this area that an old man carrying soybean cakes was pushed off the speeding train by the Japanese devils and was smashed into a bloody pulp…
    With a long whistle, the train stopped. "Minquan Station" had arrived. The neat red station building was newly built. The area of scattered low thatched huts beside the station in the past had become a wide, noisy street. The pickpockets and beggars who used to crowd near the station were nowhere to be seen, and two or three groups of children carrying schoolbags were walking on the road north of the station.
    It was twenty miles south from the station to my home—Loulou Village. Fortunately, there was a team of horse-drawn carts going south. The cart driver saw that it was a PLA soldier who wanted a ride, and without saying a price, he let me get on the cart. The cart driver cracked his whip, and the cart started running. Each cart was harnessed with tall and sturdy mules and horses. I asked the cart driver in the same cart, "Are these horses and carts your own?" He laughed and said, "Why, comrade, do you still think I'm driving for someone else? This isn't before liberation, how could a cart driver not have his own horses and carts!" I also laughed and said, "Even if you had a horse before liberation, I'm afraid you wouldn't dare to run it here!" He said, "That goes without saying! The village couldn't even feed a small donkey. If such a horse were running on the road, wouldn't it be delivering itself to the 'Central Army' (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek troops)!"
    The cart arrived at Zhao Hongpo, and I got off and walked onto a small path. After passing Wu Lao's house, the silhouette of my home—Loulou Village, which I had been away from for more than eight years—was in front of me: a long row of new houses with white walls was exposed among the green trees, and broken walls and dilapidated houses were nowhere to be seen. The village had stretched out, and many threshing grounds had been added at both ends. Is this my hometown? Looking closely, I could still recognize it. Isn't that the high hill of He Ge's family behind the jujube forest? I quickened my pace, turned to the west end, and arrived in front of the village. The front of the village had really changed. Loulou Village was originally a hook-shaped village, with more than twenty families' thatched houses scattered along the northern edge of a large pit. South of the pit, except for the large courtyard of the landlord Zhai, there were no houses. But now the concave part of the hook had been filled, and the village had become a square. The north side of the pit was full of houses, and new houses had been built on the south side, and they were expanding outward. The periphery of the village had all become threshing grounds, and newly harvested wheat was piled everywhere.
    Hearing that I was back, everyone ran to see me. The house and courtyard were full of people. Most of the children were wearing student uniforms, and I didn't recognize a single one. I could still recognize those over twenty, but their faces were much more rosy than before. I remember eight years ago, many uncles, brothers, and younger brothers had dry faces, like they were suffering from tuberculosis. Now there wasn't a single face like that. They noticed I was staring blankly, and someone laughed and said, "Do you think we're all old?" I said, "It's not that you're old, it's that you're fat." Everyone burst into laughter. Everyone said, "Yes, we don't go hungry anymore after liberation!" Then, people naturally began to talk about the process of emancipation. From the casual conversation, I learned that all the land owned by the landlord Zhai near my village had been given to my village, and the land of two or three small landlords in the village had also been distributed during the land reform. Every person in the village had two or three mu of land. Those uncles, brothers, and younger brothers who used to beg for food, push "manure carts" (collecting wild manure to sell, almost like begging for food), and do odd jobs (doing odd jobs for others) were all living a middle-peasant life. Many who had been fleeing famine for many years had also returned. The population had increased rapidly, and the number of houses had increased even more. While we were talking, everyone suddenly stood up. At this time, I noticed that eighty-year-old Grandpa Xiang was walking in with a cane. While helping the old man to sit down, I remembered Grandpa Xiang eight years ago. At that time, he and his three sons relied on pushing manure carts and collecting crops for a living, and when they couldn't make ends meet, they went out to beg for food. Rich people said their family was a "den of thieves" and called him "old thief." The landlord's lackeys often tied them up, either beating them until they were bleeding or sending them to the township office to starve for a few days. Now he and his sons had been allocated houses and land, and his sons were fighting to support him. The whole clan respectfully called him "old clan leader" (a title for the elders of the clan).
    Then a black-bearded man came in from outside. Everyone called him "village chief," but I didn't recognize him at all. At this time, he introduced himself: "Little brother, you don't recognize me, do you! I was out begging for food before you were born, and I didn't come back until after the land reform. After coming back, I was given land and was even elected as village chief. No, I'm not doing a good job, and I haven't taken good care of your family!" The village had taken good care of my family, and I knew that before I returned home. As for how well he was doing as village chief, I found out later: the village's work was among the best in the township.
    "Hearing that my brother came back, I rushed over here…" A woman in her thirties with short hair squeezed in while saying this. Looking closely, it turned out to be Sister-in-law San. Before I could ask, everyone rushed to introduce her: "She is the deputy head of our township and also the director of the women's federation in our village." After hearing other people's introductions, she said a little shyly: "Everyone knows that I'm a fool, I have no education, I can't speak well, and I can't do anything well." But that very night, I saw her personally handle a dispute between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. The reasoning was very clear, just like a political instructor in a company. After the dispute was resolved, both the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were satisfied. Before liberation, people said that Sister-in-law San was a fool, with broad shoulders and thick legs who could work, but she didn't know how to flatter her mother-in-law and husband, so she was often beaten and bullied. But after only three or four years of liberation, she actually shouldered the important responsibility of leading a township. The laboring people who were emancipated under the leadership of the Communist Party, how fast they have progressed!
    After all, it was the busy season for farming, and after talking for a while, everyone went to work. Before leaving, they repeatedly told me: "Have a good rest, and we'll talk more at night." But I couldn't sit still, so I followed them to the threshing ground. Some of the threshing grounds were filled with dust from winnowing wheat, and several mutual aid teams that had harvested wheat quickly were stacking wheat straw stacks. Jing Ge's (the village's farmers' association director) team was busy carrying water to water sweet potato seedlings. It hadn't rained locally for a long time, and Jing Ge's team was determined not to let the sweet potato seedlings lack water. According to people, his team was the backbone team in the village, and they were also preparing to strive for the model team in the township. In order to prevent drought, everyone discussed the matter of digging wells more actively. I laughed and said to Jing Ge: "Our village has never seen anyone buy a waterwheel or dig a well in the fields!" He said: "Isn't it because life is getting better? Didn't our village not hoe wheat for generations before? We also started hoeing last year. Everyone is preparing to go to Baigang (a large village ten miles east of Loulou Village) to visit the seven-inch step plow, and is also preparing to study Qu Yaoli's cotton planting method." He Ge, who was threshing wheat, also interjected: "Our village is much better than when you left! At that time, there were fewer than fifteen small donkeys that could be picked up and hugged in the whole village. Now, there are sixty or seventy more fat and strong livestock, and more than ten more carts. There are also more children going to school. At most, there were only five children in the whole village who studied in private schools for a few days, and later no one could afford to study anymore; now almost all the children have entered school, totaling more than thirty, and some are preparing to go to the city to take the middle school entrance examination after the wheat harvest…" Just as we were talking about this, his words were interrupted by the sound of others asking me to talk about tractors.
    The next day, just after breakfast, I heard a group of people coming in with giggles and laughter. I thought that Sister-in-law San was asking me to go to the people's school to talk to the women's members about the Marriage Law. When I asked, it turned out that Jing Ge had come to inquire about the typhoon news. I remembered seeing news about the typhoon in the newspaper that day, but I quickly forgot about it. Now that I heard the word "typhoon" from their mouths, I was surprised and asked them: "How do you know there's a typhoon?" "The township office sent someone in the middle of the night to notify us: 'Press down the wheat straw stacks to prevent typhoons.' I don't know if the typhoon will come?" After hearing this, I made a strong comparison between the two governments: Before liberation, if "the township office sent someone in the middle of the night," that was the most terrible thing, because there was nothing else to do except arrest people. Now the people's township government is actually going to the village in the middle of the night to notify people to "prevent typhoons." I said with emotion: "Now the government and the people are truly united!" They said one after another: "The people's government is really our government. Now the government tells us to do anything, and there's no second word. A few days ago, the government called on us to carry out the patriotic health movement, and our village held a meeting to clean up. A while ago, we contributed airplanes and cannons and suppressed counter-revolutionaries, and we did everything very vigorously. Last year, we paid the public grain, and our village even won an award!"
    As there were fewer people in the yard, I heard a commotion outside. I went out to take a look, and a group of men and women were gathered on the road. It turned out that the township cooperative's truck had arrived. The women who were squeezed out were comparing the floral fabrics and socks they had just bought, and the children were shouting and laughing. I went up to ask my sister about the price of the red broadcloth she bought, and it was about the same as the price I saw at the Nanjing State-owned Department Store a week ago. After watching for a while, I couldn't help but say: "I never thought that our village could buy these things!" Several people interjected at the same time: "This year's spring drought, our wheat harvest here is not good enough; otherwise, we would buy even more. Life is getting better, who wouldn't want to wear something nice? All in all, we have to thank our Chairman Mao!" Yes, Chairman Mao brought a good life to the laboring people of Loulou Village, so everyone never forgets Chairman Mao. Every family in Loulou Village hangs Chairman Mao's portrait in the center of the house on the past shrine. Just like everyone said that night: "We worshipped gods for many years, but we were still hungry; Chairman Mao came, and life got better, who would we worship if not Chairman Mao!" Yes, the suffering people of my hometown for so many years, like the people of the whole country, have tasted the taste of happiness; and they know that an even happier life is still ahead.
    But just as I was reminiscing about this happy life, the Korean villages bombed into piles of ashes by American planes, the Korean children howling on the bloody corpses of their mothers, and the black swarms of poisonous insects suddenly flashed in my mind…. I was restless. I had originally planned to stay at home for three days, but now I couldn't stay any longer. After lunch, I packed my bags, anxious as fire. I couldn't wait to step to my national defense post, grasp my weapons tightly, and aim them at the greedy wolf—American imperialism. I will never allow the American devils to turn thousands of the country's villages, as happy as my hometown, into piles of ashes, and I will never allow the enemy to take away the mothers of those jumping and laughing children! I will not allow the invaders to touch a hair of the motherland!
    Early in the morning on the third day, I got on the eastbound train on the Longhai Railway again.

    故乡记行
    中国人民解放军空军战士    华晨
    陇海路的西去列车急风般地奔驰着，前边不远就是民权车站。一别八年多的故乡——河南睢县飞速地迎了上来。车窗外一片泥金色的麦海，麦海中飘荡着红色小旗。黑鸦鸦的人群在红旗近处忙着收割，歌声笑声不断从人群中飞来。听了解情况的同车旅客谈：“红旗是互助组的旗子。农民们正在竞赛收割。”真想不到，“红旗”、“互助组”、“竞赛”等等这些代表幸福生活的名词，现在竟然也和我这多灾多难的故乡连在一起了！
    提起灾难，记忆把我拉回到八年以前。那时自己因为参加革命，第一次离开故乡，从民权车站乘车东去。不也正是这个地区吗？不也是车窗外这些田野和村庄吗？那时正是春光明媚的季节，可是田野上、村庄里却难看到一个人影。村里十门九闭，树皮野菜都吃光了，没饿死的人多逃荒到解放区。那时，东去的列车车顶上都爬满了逃荒的和做小生意的人。那一个不向日本鬼子、汉奸塞钱，那一个就会遭到毒打，甚至被推下火车。也正是在这一带，一个背豆饼的老大爷被日本鬼子从飞跑的火车上推下去，摔得血肉模糊……
    一声气笛长吼，车停了下来。“民权车站”到了。整齐的红色站房是新盖的，过去站旁散乱的矮茅屋地区已经变成马路宽广、人声喧闹的市街了。过去挤在车站附近的扒手、乞丐一个也看不见了，站北的马路上走着两三群背书包的孩子。
    从车站南去到我家——鲁楼村还有二十里。正好有一队南去的马车。赶车工人看是解放军军人要搭车，不肯说价钱就让上车了。赶车工人鞭子一扬，马车跑了起来。每辆车都套着高大健壮的骡马。我问同车的赶车工人：“这车马都是自己的吗？”他笑了起来，说：“怎么，你同志还以为我是替别人赶车吗？现在不是解放以前啦，赶马车的谁还能没车马！”我也笑着说：“解放前你就是有马，恐怕也不敢在这里跑吧！”他说：“那还用说！庄里连条小毛驴还喂不住，这样的马要在路上跑，还不是给‘中央军’（指蒋匪军）送上门！”
    车到了赵洪坡，下车走上小道。过了吴老家，一别八年多的家园——鲁楼村的背影展现在眼前：绿树丛中露出一长排新屋的白墙，残墙、烂屋看不到了。庄子伸长了，两头增加了不少打麦场。这是我的故乡吗？仔细看还能认得，那枣树林后不正是和哥家的高岗子吗？我加快了脚步，转过西头，到了村前。村前才真的变了呢。鲁楼村本来是个拐子尺形的村子，二十多家人家的茅草屋，散乱地挤在大坑北沿。大坑南除了翟家大地主的大院子以外，没有什么房子。可是，现在拐子尺的尺凹填满了，村子变成了正方形的，坑北住得满满的，坑南也盖起了成片的新屋，并且正在向外扩展。村子外围都变成了打麦场，新收上场的麦子堆得到处都是。
    听说我回来了，大家都跑来看我。屋里院里挤满了人。孩子们多半穿着学生装，一个也不认得。二十岁以上的还能认得，但他们的脸比从前红润多了。记得八年前，许多伯、叔、哥、弟们都是干巴巴的脸，像害着痨病。现在一张那样的脸也没有了。他们发觉我在呆望，有人就笑着说：“你看俺们都老了吧？”我说：“不是老了，是胖了。”一下就轰的笑起来了。大家说：“是呀，解放以后不挨饿啦！”接着，人们很自然地谈起翻身的经过来。从漫谈中我知道：翟家大地主在我村附近占有的田地全归我村了，还有两三家本村的小地主的地也在土地改革时分了出来。全村每人都有了二、三亩土地。过去那些讨饭的、推“大粪车子”的（拾野粪卖，跟讨饭差不多）、打闲的（给人作零工）伯、叔、哥、弟们都过起了中农生活。许多长年逃荒在外的也都回来了。人口迅速增加了，房屋增加得更多。正谈着，大家忽然站了起来，这时我发觉八十多岁的祥爷扶着拐杖走了进来。在扶他老人家坐下的同时，我想起了八年前的祥爷。那时，他和三个儿子都靠推粪车、拾庄稼糊口，揭不开锅的时候就出外讨饭。有钱的人说他们家是“贼窝”，说他是“老贼头”。地主狗腿子常把他们绑起来，不是打得头破血流，就是送乡公所饿几天。现在他和儿子都分到了房子和土地，几个儿子争着养活他。全族都尊称他“老族长”（一族长者之称）。
    接着又从外面进来一个黑胡子的人。别人都喊他“村长”，我却一点不认得。这时他自我介绍了：“老弟，你不认得我吧！从你出生以前我就在外逃荒要饭，一直混到土地改革以后才回来。回来分了土地，还被选上村长。不行，干不好，对您家照顾得很差！”村里对我家照顾得是很好的，我在回家以前就知道了。至于他干村长干得怎么样，后来也就知道了：村里的工作是全乡数得着的。
    “听说俺兄弟回来了，我急忙往这跑……”一个剪了头发的三十多岁的妇女，一边说，一边挤上来了。仔细一看，原来是三嫂。没等我问，大家就争着介绍了：“她是咱乡的副乡长，又兼咱庄的妇联主任。”听了别人的介绍，她有点不好意思地说：“大家也都知道，我是个傻子，没文化，又不会讲话，啥也做不好。”可是就在那天晚上，我亲眼看见她处理一桩婆媳纠纷，道理谈得头头是道，简直像连队里的一个指导员。纠纷处理完了，婆媳都满意。解放以前人们都说三嫂傻，膀宽腿粗能劳动，可是不会奉承婆婆、丈夫，因此常常挨打受气。但是，解放仅仅三四年，她竟然担负了一个乡的领导重责。在共产党领导下翻了身的劳动人民，进步得多快啊！
    到底是农忙的季节，谈了一阵以后，大家便都分头忙活去了。临走一再嘱咐我：“好好休息一下，晚上再谈。”可是我坐也坐不住，就跟着跑到打麦场上。有的场上正弥漫着扬麦的沙尘，几个收麦较快的互助组正在堆麦秸垛。经哥（村农会主任）的一组正在忙着挑水浇红薯秧。当地已久不落雨，经哥那一组下决心不叫红薯秧缺水。听人讲，他那组是全村的骨干组，他们还准备争取全乡的模范组。为了防旱，大家对打井的事讨论得更积极了。我在三四个打麦场上都碰到他们漫谈“解放式”水车。我笑着对经哥说：“咱村祖辈也没见买过水车，没见在地里打过井呵！”他说：“还不是日子过好了吗？咱村从前不是祖辈也没锄过麦子吗？从去年也开头锄啦。大家正准备到白岗（鲁楼村东十里路的一个大村）参观七寸步犁，还准备研究曲耀离的种棉法哩。”正在碾麦的合哥也插上嘴：“咱村比你走时好多啦！那时一抱抱起的小毛驴全村不足十五条。眼前呢，肥壮的牲口添了六七十头，大车多了十多辆。上学的孩子也多了。从前顶多的时候，全村也只有五个孩子念了几天私塾，后来谁也念不起了；眼前孩子们差不多都进了学校，合起来三十多个，有的麦后还准备进城考中学哩……”刚谈到这里，他的话被别人要我讲讲拖拉机的声音插断了。
    第二天刚吃过早饭，就听着嘻嘻哈哈地进来一群人。我以为又是三嫂叫我到民校给妇女会员们谈婚姻法哩。问起来，却是经哥来打听台风的消息。我记得在那天的报上看到过关于台风的消息，可是很快就忘了。现在从他们的口中听到“台风”二字，却使我惊奇得反问起他们来：“你们怎么知道有台风呢？”“乡公所半夜里来人通知说：‘压好麦秸垛防台风。’也不知台风会不会来？”听了这话，我把两个政府作了强烈的对比：解放前，如果“乡公所半夜里来人”，那是最可怕的事，因为除了抓人再没有别的了。现在人民的乡政府却是半夜到村里通知“防台风”。我感动地说：“现在政府和人民真结合在一块啦！”他们纷纷说：“人民政府才真是咱们的政府。现在政府叫咱干啥，没二话。前几天政府号召开展爱国卫生运动，咱村就开会，打扫卫生。早些日子，捐献飞机大炮、镇压反革命，咱们那一样都干得很来劲。去年缴公粮，咱村还得了奖哩！”
    院里人一少，就听到外面的喧嚷声。我出去一看，大路上正围着一群男女，原来是乡合作社的货车来了。挤出来的妇女们边走边比着刚买到的花布和袜子，孩子们叫着、笑着。我迎上去问了一下妹妹买的那块红洋布的价钱，和我一周前在南京国营百货公司看到的价格不相上下。我看了一会，不觉说了句：“想不到咱村也能买这些东西啦！”几个人一齐插嘴说：“今年春旱，咱这里麦收不够好；要不，买的更多。日子好过了，谁还不穿点？说来说去都得谢谢咱毛主席！”是的，毛主席给鲁楼村的劳动人民带来了好日子，所以大家时时刻刻不忘毛主席。鲁楼村家家都把毛主席的像挂在屋子正中过去的神台上。正像那天晚上大家说的：“供了多年神，咱们还是挨饿；毛主席来了，日子过好啦，不供毛主席供谁！”是的，多少年来受苦受难的故乡人民，和全国人民一样，尝到幸福的滋味了；而且他们知道，更幸福的生活还在后面。
    但就在回味这幸福生活的时候，我脑子里突然闪出被美机炸成灰堆的朝鲜村庄，爬在母亲血肉模糊的尸体上嚎哭的朝鲜孩子和黑鸦鸦的毒虫……。我坐卧不安了。我本来打算在家停留三天的，这一下我停留不下去了。午饭后我就整理行装，心急如火，我恨不得一步踏到自己的国防岗位上去，握紧武器，对准那贪婪的野狼——美帝国主义。我决不容许美国鬼子把像我故乡一样幸福的千万个祖国的乡村变成灰堆，更不允许敌人夺去那些跳着笑着的孩子们的母亲！我不容许侵略者触动祖国的一根毫毛！
    第三天清早，我又坐上了陇海路东去的列车。
