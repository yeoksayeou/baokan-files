Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: The Yoshida reactionary group, defying the will of the Japanese people of all strata, has forced the passage of the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" through the Diet and will establish the special agent-like "Public Security Examination Commission" and "Public Security Investigation Agency" as organs for implementing this law. The conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to intensify the suppression of the Japanese people is now fully revealed.

The "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" is an anti-people law, and the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries attempt to use this law as a basis for declaring the Japanese Communist Party illegal and suppressing all peaceful and democratic movements in the future. The Yoshida group first submitted the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" to the Diet's House of Representatives for discussion on April 17th and forcibly passed it on May 15th. Subsequently, the bill was transferred to the Diet's House of Councillors. As in the House of Representatives, this anti-people bill was unanimously opposed by all opposition parties in the House of Councillors. Even the conservative right-wing Socialists and Ryokufūkai submitted amendments to the bill, although these amendments did not make any substantive changes to the original bill. Under the influence of strong opposition from the Japanese people, the House of Councillors' Legal Affairs Committee rejected the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and the two amendments on June 19th. On June 25th, the House of Councillors plenary session began discussing these proposals. In view of its isolated situation, the Yoshida group had to compromise with the Ryokufūkai, and was forced to approve the Ryokufūkai's amendment. With the collusion of the Liberal Party and the Ryokufūkai, the House of Councillors passed the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" revised according to the Ryokufūkai's opinion on July 3rd. On the 4th, the House of Representatives also passed this amendment, completing the legislative procedure for the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." The Diet also passed bills on the establishment of the "Public Security Examination Commission" and the "Public Security Investigation Agency" at the same time to ensure the implementation of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law."

The Yoshida group's reactionary measure of manipulating the Diet to pass the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" does not indicate the consolidation of the Yoshida group's ruling power. On the contrary, it fully demonstrates the Yoshida group's isolation and fear of the increasingly powerful forces of the Japanese people. When the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" had not yet been submitted to the Diet, the Japanese people began to vigorously launch a movement against this reactionary bill. From April 12th to June 20th, the Japanese working masses successively held five major strikes against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," with participants ranging from hundreds of thousands to one million each time. More workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and people from other strata have used rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and other means to support the striking workers and protest the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law."

This vigorous mass struggle has affected the inside of the Diet. When the House of Representatives voted on the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" on May 15th, the opposition parties unanimously voted against it. The House of Councillors' Legal Affairs Committee's rejection of this reactionary bill is another proof of the Yoshida group's weakness and powerlessness. Although the Yoshida group finally won over the Ryokufūkai, which has always been in cahoots with it, most of the opposition parties have consistently opposed the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." According to Kyodo News, the opposition parties issued a statement on the 3rd, severely criticizing the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," accusing its reactionary nature of surpassing the "Peace Preservation Law" of the Japanese imperial era. The statement advocated that the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" must be abolished as soon as possible in order to defend democracy.

The "Akahata" published a statement by the Japanese Communist Party's Diet members on the 5th. The statement pointed out that the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" will enable the Yoshida government to more actively participate in the policies of U.S. imperialism. The statement also called on the Japanese people to rise up and resist this fascist bill.

    美日反动派强制日本国会通过“防止破坏活动法案”
    日共国会议员团号召日本人民反抗
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：吉田反动集团违背日本各阶层人民的意志，强制国会通过了法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”，并将设立特务性的“公安审查委员会”和“公安调查厅”，作为执行这个法案的机关。美、日反动派企图加紧镇压日本人民的阴谋已昭然若揭。
    “防止破坏活动法案”是一个反人民的法案，美、日反动派企图利用这个法案作为将来宣布日本共产党为非法和镇压一切和平民主运动的根据。吉田集团在四月十七日首先将“防止破坏活动法案”提交国会众院讨论，并在五月十五日强制众院予以通过。接着，这个法案被移送到国会参院。和在众院讨论时的情况一样，这个反人民的法案在参院中也遭到各在野党派的一致反对，甚至保守的社会党右派和绿风会都对这个法案提出了修正案，虽然这些修正案对原案并没有作实质上的改变。在日本人民强烈反对的影响下，参院法务委员会在六月十九日否决了“防止破坏活动法案”和两个修正案。六月二十五日，参院全体会议开始讨论这些提案。吉田集团鉴于它的孤立情况，不得不向绿风会表示妥协，被迫赞成绿风会的修正案。在自由党和绿风会的勾结之下，参院在七月三日通过了根据绿风会的意见作了修改的“防止破坏活动法案”。四日，众院也通过了这个修正案，完成了“防止破坏活动法案”的立法手续。国会同时并通过了关于设置“公安审查委员会”和“公安调查厅”的法案，以保证“防止破坏活动法案”的执行。
    吉田集团操纵国会通过“防止破坏活动法案”的反动措施，并不表示吉田集团统治势力的巩固，相反地，这充分地表明了吉田集团的孤立和对日益强大的日本人民的力量的恐惧。当“防止破坏活动法案”还没有被提交国会时，日本人民就开始有力地展开了反对这个反动法案的运动。从四月十二日起到六月二十日为止，日本工人群众接连举行了五次反对“防止破坏活动法案”的大罢工，每次参加者从数十万人到一百万人。数量更多的工人、农民、学生、文化人以及其他阶层的人民，纷纷采用集会、示威、罢课等等方式，声援罢工工人，抗议“防止破坏活动法案”。
    这种如火如荼的群众斗争，影响到国会内部。当众院在五月十五日表决“防止破坏活动法案”时，在野党一致投了反对票。参院法务委员会对这个反动法案的否决，是吉田集团脆弱无力的又一证明。虽然吉田集团在最后拉拢了一贯和它狼狈为奸的绿风会，但是，大多数的在野党是始终反对“防止破坏活动法案”的。据共同社讯，在野党在三日已经发表声明，严厉抨击“防止破坏活动法案”，指责这个法案的反动性质超过日本帝国时代的“治安维持法”。声明主张必须尽快废除“防止破坏活动法案”，以保卫民主。
    “赤旗报”五日刊载了日本共产党国会议员团的声明。声明指出：“防止破坏活动法案”将会使吉田政府更积极地参加美帝国主义的政策。声明并号召日本人民起来反抗这个法西斯法案。
