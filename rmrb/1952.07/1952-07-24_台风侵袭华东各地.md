Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: In recent days, the entire Eastern China region, with the exception of Fujian Province, has been widely and directly affected by typhoons from south to north. This typhoon made landfall near Sanmen Bay, Zhejiang, on the morning of July 19th. After landfall, the typhoon center moved northwest through Ninghai, Tiantai, Zhuji, Tonglu in Zhejiang, and Ningguo, Guangde, Langxi, and Xuancheng in southern Anhui, then turned north through Liyang, Danyang, and other counties in southern Jiangsu, reaching the area between Nanjing and Wuhu on the morning of the 22nd. At 2:00 AM this morning, the typhoon center had moved to the area east of Xuzhou. On the 19th and 20th, the typhoon's wind force reached level 10 or above at its strongest. The moving speed of the typhoon center was initially faster, with a maximum of 16 kilometers per hour; later it was very slow, with a minimum of only 4 kilometers per hour. The long duration and wide impact range of this typhoon are unprecedented in Eastern China in recent years.
    The Eastern China Flood and Drought Control Headquarters had already instructed Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu coastal areas, and Shanghai to pay attention to defenses before the typhoon reached the mainland. On the afternoon of the 18th, an emergency meeting was convened, and notices were sent overnight to various places that would be affected by the typhoon, urging people to mobilize to defend against it. On the 19th, leading party and government organs and cadres at all levels in Ningbo and Jiaxing prefectures in coastal Zhejiang, Songjiang and Suzhou prefectures in southern Jiangsu, and Nantong prefecture in coastal northern Jiangsu led the people to the seawalls and river embankments. On the 18th, more than 300 district and township cadres from Haining County, Jiaxing Prefecture, were holding a meeting in the county seat. Upon hearing the news of the typhoon, they immediately stopped the meeting and rushed back to their districts and villages to lead the people in defending the seawalls. On the 19th, 4,000 people in Haiyan County, Zhejiang, were inspecting the seawalls. From Zhejiang to the northern Jiangsu coast, a large number of laborers were mobilized on the 19th to be ready to rush to the rescue at any time. The Songhu Garrison Command also concentrated 2,000 soldiers, ready to be dispatched at any time. Because the defensive deployments in various places were relatively quick, and the leadership and defense forces were relatively strong, the typhoon did not cause a major disaster in the coastal areas, and no major accidents occurred in the past three or four days. In the Jinshanwei to Qijiadun section of the seawall in Songjiang County, southern Jiangsu, where there were many dangerous spots, more than 10,000 pieces of protective stones were blown away by the wind on the evening of the 20th in some places; hundreds of cement piles were broken in some places; and the cement block stone revetment collapsed by one centimeter in some places, which was a very critical situation. However, as a result of the rescue efforts led by the people of Songjiang County, it was repaired by the afternoon of the 21st. Many places on the river embankments in Changshu and Taicang counties in southern Jiangsu, the embankments on Chongming Island, and the embankments in Rugao County in northern Jiangsu had gaps caused by the wind and waves, but they were quickly repaired by the rescuers.
    The losses caused by this typhoon, as far as can be seen at present, are limited to the flooding caused by rain and flash floods in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, and the damage and flooding of rice in some areas. Although Fujian Province was not directly affected by the typhoon, torrential rains have fallen for days, and the rivers have risen sharply. The Min River has exceeded the danger level. To this end, the Eastern China Flood and Drought Control Headquarters has instructed various places to step up flood control, drainage, and repair of embankments and dikes; instructed various places in Zhejiang to investigate the losses of the masses; instructed southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, and the Shandong coast to continue to maintain strict defenses; and instructed the Linqi Prefecture Flood and Drought Control Organization in Shandong to pay close attention to the possible rise of the Yi and Shu rivers after the typhoon.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: The Shanghai Meteorological Observatory issued a typhoon report at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, stating that at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, the typhoon center was located near Yongcheng in northern Anhui and moving in a northwest-north direction, with a speed of about 13 to 15 kilometers per hour. Currently, the wind force in the coastal areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu is around level 8 to 9, and the wind force in southern Shandong and the Jiaodong area is around level 7 to 8. The wind force in the northern part of northern Jiangsu and the northern part of northern Anhui is around level 6 to 7; the wind force in other areas is gradually weakening. It is expected that the typhoon center will reach the area between Heze and Yuncheng in Pingyuan Province at 8:00 PM today. The typhoon will affect the southern Bohai Sea, the Shandong and northern Jiangsu coasts, the entire Shandong area, the northern part of northern Jiangsu, and the northern part of northern Anhui. Now, the Shanghai area, southern Jiangsu, the southern part of northern Anhui, the northeastern part of southern Anhui, and the Jiaxing prefecture in eastern Zhejiang have lifted the emergency alert at 4:00 AM today. However, there are still level 6 to 7 winds in the coastal areas of southern Jiangsu and the Wusongkou area, and it is also the time of the month-end high tide. All relevant parties are paying close attention to prevention.

### 台风侵袭华东各地

    台风侵袭华东各地
    【新华社上海二十三日电】近日来，华东全区除福建省外，由南到北普遍直接受到台风侵袭。这次台风在七月十九日晨，从浙江三门湾附近登陆。登陆后，台风中心向西北经过浙江宁海、天台、诸暨、桐卢和皖南宁国、广德、郎溪、宣城一带，又转向北经过苏南的溧阳、丹阳等县境，二十二日上午到达南京、芜湖之间。今晨二时，台风中心已移至徐州以东地区。十九、二十两日台风风力最大时达到十级以上。台风中心移动速度初期较大，最大时每小时十六公里；以后很缓慢，最小时每小时仅四公里。这次台风停留时间之久和影响范围之大，都是华东区近几年来所没有的。
    华东防汛抗旱总指挥部早在台风到达大陆以前，就已布置浙江、苏南、苏北沿海地区和上海市注意设防。十八日下午，又特别召开一次紧急会议，连夜通知将有台风侵袭各地，赶紧动员人民起来防御。十九日浙江沿海的宁波专区和嘉兴专区，苏南沿海松江专区和苏州专区，苏北区沿海的南通专区等地的各级党政领导机关、各级干部就都带领人民赶到了海塘和江堤附近。十八日，嘉兴专区海宁县三百多人的区、乡干部正在县城开会，他们听到台风来袭的消息，立即停会赶回了区、村，领导人民防守海塘。浙江海盐县十九日就已有四千人巡查海塘。从浙江到苏北沿岸，十九日都集中了大批民工，准备随时出动抢险。淞沪警备司令部也集中了二千名战士，准备随时出动。因为各地防御部署较快，领导和防守力量比较坚强，台风在沿海地区，没有造成巨大灾害，三、四日来都没有发生重大的事故。险工较多的苏南区松江县金山嘴到七家墩一段海塘，有些地方二十日晚曾被大风卷起护塘块石
    一万多块；有些地方的洋灰桩被折断了好几百根；有些地方洋灰块石护坡下塌一公寸，情况非常危急，但松江县领导人民抢救的结果二十一日下午就赶修好了。苏南常熟县和太仓县的江堤，崇明岛的堤和苏北如皋县的堤都有好些地方被风浪打出缺口，但很快就被抢险的人们赶修好了。
    这次台风引起的损失，就目前看只是福建、浙江两省因雨山洪暴发，部分地区的稻子有被吹坏的和被水淹的。福建省虽未受到台风的直接侵袭，但连日大雨倾盆，各河猛涨，闽江已超过危险水位。为此，华东防汛抗旱总指挥部已分别指示各地加紧防汛、排涝、修补堤圩；指示浙江各地调查群众损失；指示苏南、苏北、山东沿海继续严密防守；并指示山东临沂专区防汛抗旱组织，要它密切注意台风之后，可能引起的沂河、沭河的上涨。
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海气象台二十三日上午十时发布台风报告称：二十三日八时台风中心位置在皖北永城附近向西北偏北方向移动，每小时速度约十三到十五公里。现在，山东、苏北沿海一带，风力在八到九级左右，鲁南、胶东地区，风力在七到八级左右；苏北北部和皖北北部地区风力在六到七级左右；其他地区风力逐渐减弱。预计今日二十时台风中心将达到平原省菏泽、郓城之间。台风将侵袭渤海南部，山东、苏北沿海，山东全部地区、苏北北部及皖北北部地区。现在，上海地区、苏南区、皖北南部地区、皖南东北部地区、浙东嘉兴专区已经在今日上午四时解除紧急警报。但是，苏南沿海及吴淞口仍有六到七级风，又正遇月底高潮，现各有关方面正密切注意防范。
