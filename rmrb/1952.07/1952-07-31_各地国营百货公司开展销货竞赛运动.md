The Southwest District Department Store's Industrial Products Sales Campaign
Driving and Leading Cooperatives and Private Merchants
The China Department Store Southwest District Company, which has challenged state-owned department stores across the country, is actively launching a large-scale industrial product promotion campaign in many ways. The provincial and district branches of the Southwest District Company have successively held meetings of branch managers, conveyed and studied the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government's instructions on launching industrial product sales campaigns nationwide, criticized the bureaucratic and capitalist management thinking existing in their work, and completed preparatory work such as clearing inventory, ranking commodities, and reviewing commodity prices. Various departments have formulated competition plans based on their specific circumstances and are actively taking action.

The industrial product sales campaign of the China Department Store Southwest District Company and its branches has received the support of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels. In Guizhou, Xikang, South Sichuan, North Sichuan, and West Sichuan provinces and districts, under the direct leadership of the Communist Party committees and people's governments, commodity exchange conferences have been held, which have played a significant role in opening up the sales channels for industrial products. The Financial and Economic Committee of the South Sichuan Administrative Office specifically established an Industrial Products to the Countryside Committee to strengthen leadership over this campaign and transferred more than forty cadres to assist the department store in organizing promotion teams to conduct promotion work in the rural areas of various counties and districts.

In the industrial product promotion campaign, the department stores in various parts of the Southwest District conscientiously implemented the policy of focusing on wholesale and actively driving and leading cooperatives and private merchants. As a result, the sales volume of industrial products has been continuously increasing. The total sales in the first ten days of July increased by 13 percent compared with the last ten days of June, and continued to increase in the middle ten days of July. After the Chongqing Department Store began implementing a specialized promotion system in mid-June, its sales volume has significantly increased, and the sales in the first ten days of July were equivalent to 85 percent of the total sales in June.

East China District Department Store Decides to Expand This Year's
Industrial Product Sales Plan by 18 Percent
From July 17th to July 22nd, the China Department Store East China District Company held a joint meeting of managers and trade union chairmen of its subordinate companies at all levels to deploy the industrial product promotion campaign. The meeting decided to expand this year's sales plan by 18 percent and decided to launch a red flag competition for industrial product promotion campaigns in the entire district starting from August 1st. The meeting formulated overall work competition targets for the third quarter in response to the challenge from the China Department Store Southwest District Company. The main contents of the third quarter's overall targets are: 1. The sales plan for the third quarter should be expanded by 6.5 percent compared with the number approved by the East China Military and Political Committee's Trade Department, and it must be guaranteed to be completed on a monthly basis. 2. In order to reduce the inventory of accumulated materials, in addition to completing the sales figures for various major commodities in the plan, it is also necessary to guarantee the over-fulfillment of the sales tasks for certain large-volume accumulated commodities. 3. Vigorously develop wholesale business and ensure that wholesale sales account for more than 75 percent of total sales. 4. Resolutely implement the policy of closely integrating with cooperatives and actively encouraging private merchants to promote sales, and ensure the supply of department stores for institutions, troops, schools, mines, and factories. Through this movement, a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of price policies will be carried out. 5. Ensure the sale of major summer goods such as undershirts and light-colored cloth by the end of the third quarter. 6. Reduce commodity circulation costs. The general level of commodity circulation costs in the third quarter should reach 8.78 percent, a decrease of 3.07 percent compared with the same period last year; a decrease of 0.65 percent compared with the third quarter figure in the original annual plan; and a decrease of 3.18 percent compared with the first quarter. 7. Accelerate capital turnover and save cash inventory. The average cash turnover rate in June was 2.34 days, and it is guaranteed to be compressed to 2.09 days in each month of the third quarter. 8. Complete the transportation plan, improve storage and transportation management, reduce costs, reduce accidents, shorten transportation time, and ensure that material supply is not disconnected and that inventory materials do not mold and deteriorate. 9. Resolutely implement the various reporting systems stipulated by the superiors and ensure that the figures are comprehensive and accurate. 10. Clear the accounting statements, and ensure that the second quarter accounting settlement is reported before August 10.

Northwest District Department Store Responds to Challenge from Southwest District Department Store

The conditions for responding to the competition are: (1) Resolutely implement policies, laws and decrees, and superior instructions, implement the business policy of focusing on wholesale, making wholesale account for 75 percent of total sales, guarantee over-fulfillment of the 1952 sales task, and increase production and practice economy by 60.5 billion yuan.
