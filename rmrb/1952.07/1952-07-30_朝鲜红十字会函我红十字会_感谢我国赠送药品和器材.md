Xinhua News Agency, 28th: When the 7th Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team returned to China in May, it donated its medical equipment and medicines to a certain hospital of the Korean People's Army, the Korean Red Cross Society, and the Korean National Special Anti-Epidemic Committee. The Korean Red Cross Society sent a letter to express its gratitude. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Chairman Li Dequan of the Chinese Red Cross Society:

Our association has received your letter regarding your association's donation of medicines and medical equipment from the International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team to our association. At the same time, we have also received a large number of medicines and medical equipment brought by the captain of the 7th Detachment of the International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team.

Since the American aggressors began their armed aggression against our country, your association has given us great material and spiritual assistance. This time, you have again donated many medicines and medical equipment. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to your association.

The International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team of your association, composed of outstanding medical workers from your country, immediately launched a heroic and fearless struggle after arriving in Korea. They gave us great help in healing wounded Korean People's Army soldiers and thwarting the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. Through their work, the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has become even deeper.

The Korean people warmly praise the members of your association's International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team who have returned after completing their noble and sacred mission, and pay them high tribute. Their glorious achievements will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Korean people. Their proletarian internationalist thought and high humanitarian spirit will be examples for all Korean medical workers and all our Red Cross comrades.

Today, the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood, has been further consolidated through the common sacred struggle against American aggression, and has become an invincible force.

With the warm support and solidarity of the worldwide democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union and peace-loving people, the Chinese and Korean people, united like steel and waging a just war, will surely win.

Finally, I wish the great Chinese people ever greater prosperity and your association greater achievements in its work.

Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
     Chairman Li Dongying (signed and sealed)
          June 6, 1952, Pyongyang

    【新华社二十八日讯】中国红十字会国际医防服务队第七大队在五月间由朝鲜返国时，将该队医疗器材和药品分赠朝鲜人民军某医院、朝鲜红十字会和朝鲜国家特别防疫委员会。朝鲜红十字会对此特来函表示谢意。该信全文如下：中国红十字会总会李德全会长：
    本会收到了贵会将国际医防服务队的药品及医药器材赠予本会的信件，同时，也收下了国际医防服务队第七大队队长带来的大批药品和医药器材。
    自从美国侵略者向我国开始了武装侵略之后，贵会给予了我们物质上的和精神上的极大援助，此次又赠送了很多药品和医药器材，现谨向贵会表示深深的谢意。
    由贵国优秀的医务工作者组成的贵会国际医防服务队，到了朝鲜以后，立即展开了英勇的、不怕牺牲的斗争，为了医好朝鲜人民军伤员和粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战，给予我们以极大帮助。通过他们的工作，朝中两国人民的深厚友谊更加深厚了。
    朝鲜人民热烈地赞颂着完成高贵的神圣任务而返国的贵会国际医防服务队队员们，并向他们致以崇高的敬意。他们的光辉业绩将会永远记忆在朝鲜人民的心中，他们所发挥的无产阶级国际主义思想和高度的人道主义精神，将是全体朝鲜医务工作者和我们红十字会全体同志们的范例。
    今天，朝中两国人民以鲜血凝成的牢不可破的友好与团结关系，通过共同反对美国侵略的神圣斗争，已更加巩固，成为一支不可战胜的力量。
    在以伟大的苏联为首的全世界民主阵营与爱好和平人民的热烈支持、声援下，钢铁般团结在一起进行着正义战争的朝中两国人民必定胜利。
    最后，谨祝伟大的中国人民日益繁荣和贵会在工作中获得更大的成就。
