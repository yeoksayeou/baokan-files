    Agricultural and Forestry Leading Organs of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces Should Strengthen Education on Afforestation for the Masses

    In areas along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line, and in Lingqiu and Xiheying in Chahar Province, and Wuchuan, Qingshuihe, and the Yikezhao League Autonomous Region in Suiyuan Province, many trees are left with only a thin trunk. Branches have been cut off from many trees by the masses. According to investigations, the masses cut off branches because they do not understand the significance and methods of afforestation. Some people believe that doing so will allow trees to grow into timber; others, for immediate needs, cut off branches for use, regardless of the growth of the trees. I suggest that the agricultural and forestry leading organs of the above two provinces conduct propaganda and education work on afforestation for the masses in order to change this situation.

    察哈尔、绥远两省农林领导机关应对群众加强植树育林的教育
    京绥铁路沿线地区，和察哈尔省灵邱、西合营，绥远省武川、清水河、伊克昭盟自治区等地，很多树木只剩了一根细长的树干。有许多林木的树枝都被群众砍掉了。据调查，群众砍伐树枝，是因为他们不知道植树育林的意义和方法。有些人认为这样做可使树木长成材料；有些人为了眼前的需要，就把树枝砍下来使用，而不管树木的生长。我建议上述两省农林领导机关，对群众进行植树育林的宣传教育工作，以便改变这种情况。        杨维德
