    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd — In order to systematically cultivate intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds and make them the backbone of national construction in various fields, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has recently decided to attach worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools to institutions of higher education, making them preparatory classes for these institutions. Worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools will also begin implementing departmental teaching plans starting this autumn.
    With worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools attached to institutions of higher education and implementing departmental teaching plans, they can receive concrete assistance and guidance in equipment and teaching; in terms of curriculum, they can be more closely linked with the courses of higher education; thus, it is conducive to students concentrating on learning the basic scientific knowledge of various subjects, so as to ensure the completion of the "accelerated" task.
    The Central Ministry of Education has recently transferred the directly affiliated Beijing Experimental Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School to the leadership of Renmin University of China, as the attached Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of the university. Another worker-peasant accelerated secondary school is also attached to Beijing Normal University. After graduation, students from the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school attached to the Normal University will directly enter the Normal University to cultivate outstanding secondary school teachers.
    The attached worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools of Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, and the Beijing Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School are currently jointly enrolling students. This year, in addition to extensively admitting worker and peasant cadres and industrial workers who are over eighteen and under thirty years old, have a cultural level equivalent to that of senior primary school graduates, are in good health, are ideologically progressive, and have a considerable number of years of work experience, the schools will also appropriately admit some young rural cadres from suburban areas who have shown positive performance in work, production, and study, as well as young shop assistants who have worked for more than three years, have shown positive performance and significant achievements in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and have certification from grassroots trade unions to study.

    中央人民政府教育部
    决定将工农速成中学附设于高等学校
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府教育部为有计划地培养工农出身的知识分子，使他们成为国家各方面建设的骨干，最近决定将工农速成中学附设于高等学校，成为高等学校的预备班。工农速成中学并自今年秋季开始实行分科教学计划。
    工农速成中学由高等学校附设，并实行分科教学计划，在设备及教学方面，可得到高等学校的具体帮助和指导；在课程上，可以与高等学校的课程衔接得更为密切；因而有利于学生集中精力，学好各科基础的科学知识，以保证“速成”任务的完成。
    中央教育部最近已将直属的北京实验工农速成中学移归中国人民大学领导，作为该大学的附设工农速成中学，另外又在北京师范大学附设一所工农速成中学。师范大学附设的工农速成中学学生毕业后，将直接升入师范大学，以培养优秀的中等学校师资。
    中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学等校的附设工农速成中学和北京市工农速成中学最近正在联合招生。各校今年除大量吸收年龄在十八岁以上、三十岁以下具有相当于高级小学毕业的文化水平，身体健康，思想进步，参加工作有相当年限的工农干部及产业工人入学外，并将适当地吸收一部分在工作、生产及学习中表现积极的郊区农村青年干部和做店员工作在三年以上、在“三反”、“五反”运动中表现积极、成绩显著、并有基层工会鉴定证明的青年店员工人入学学习。
