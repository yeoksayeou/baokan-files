    Chongqing Literary and Art Circles Hold Exhibition to Commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
    To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the Chongqing literary and art circles held an exhibition commemorating the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" at the Municipal People's Literature and Art Center. The exhibition opened on May 25th and ended on June 8th, with 42,000 visitors.
    The exhibition was divided into four parts. The first part was a literature exhibition room, displaying excellent works and various literary publications reflecting the struggles of the masses, created by revolutionary literary and art workers in the ten years since May 1942, when Chairman Mao pointed out the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. What made the audience feel particularly close was that the exhibition also displayed "Returning from Korea" by Shen Ditian, a worker at the Chongqing 101 Factory, as well as newspaper and magazine clippings of works published over the past two years by Guo Tingxuan, a female worker at the Yuxin Yarn Factory. The second part was an art exhibition room, exhibiting more than 200 woodcuts, New Year pictures, oil paintings, cartoons, sculptures, folk paper-cuts, posters, etc., reflecting the War of Liberation, land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the increase production and practice economy movement. The third part was a drama, film, and dance exhibition room, displaying more than 20 stills of new operas such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," which were first performed in Yan'an after 1942, as well as stills of dramas such as "Red Flag Song" and "In the Face of New Things" performed by various Chongqing art troupes after liberation. In terms of film and dance, more than ten award-winning and excellent films and many stills of new dances were displayed. The last part of the exhibition was a music, opera, and folk art exhibition room. In addition to displaying stills of mass music activities and new Sichuan opera and new Peking opera performances, this part mainly used broadcasting to continuously play mass songs expressing workers, peasants, and soldiers and new Sichuan opera since liberation.
    It can be seen from the exhibition that under the glorious light of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, the literary and artistic undertakings of the Chinese people have experienced vigorous development in the past ten years. The exhibition used facts to illustrate the direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao. Such an exhibition is a powerful way to promote Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought.

    展览会共分四个部分。第一部分是文学作品展览室，陈列着自一九四二年五月毛主席指出文艺为工农兵服务的方向以后，十年来革命文艺工作者遵循着这一方向所创作的反映群众斗争的优秀作品和各种文艺刊物。特别使观众感到亲切的是：展览会还展出了重庆市一○一工厂工人沈底天作的“朝鲜归来”，以及渝新纱厂女工郭廷萱两年来发表在报纸、杂志上的作品的剪报。第二部分是美术作品展览室，展出反映解放战争、土地改革、抗美援朝、增产节约的木刻、年画、油画、漫画、雕刻、民间剪纸、招贴画等二百余幅。第三部分是戏剧、电影、舞蹈展览室，陈列着一九四二年以后在延安首次演出的“白毛女”、“兄妹开荒”等新歌剧剧照二十余幅，以及重庆解放后各文工团所演出的“红旗歌”、“在新事物的面前”等话剧剧照多幅。在电影、舞蹈方面，陈列着十余部得奖的和优秀的影片及许多新舞蹈的剧照。展览会最后一部分是音乐、戏曲、曲艺展览室，除了陈列有群众音乐活动及新川戏、新京剧演出的剧照之外，这一部分主要是用广播的方式，不断地播送十年来表现工农兵的群众歌曲及解放后的新川戏。
