The Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative
Carries out Criticism and Self-Criticism in the Spring Plowing Appraisal, Further Enhancing the Ideological Awareness of its Members

Since its establishment, the Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative has seen a gradual increase in the collectivist thinking of its members, and their labor enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented heights. However, a few individuals still exhibited a scattered, conservative, and selfish ideological style during the spring plowing process. For example, when improving the soil, the cooperative needed small farm tools such as iron shovels and two-pronged forks. Some members had these at home but were unwilling to bring them out. A small number of members slacked off while working. Some members did not care about public property. To help the members of this cooperative improve ideologically, the work team of the CPC Jiaohe County Committee led all members in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

Before carrying out criticism and self-criticism, discussions were first held in the cooperative's supervisory and management committees, and then Party and Youth League member meetings and member group meetings were held separately to allow for full ideological preparation. On May 20, a general meeting of all cooperative members was held to conduct spring plowing appraisals and reviews. The criteria for the appraisal were: (1) What is the attitude towards labor? (2) Does personal interest submit to the interests of the state and the collective, and what selfish behaviors are there? (3) Is public property cherished as much as one's own property? In addition to these, cadres also had to examine their leadership style. Based on these criteria, all members, under the leadership of the cadres, conducted self-examination and mutual criticism. Deputy Director Chi Dianwen first reviewed his bureaucratic work style when leading the spring plowing. He said that he personally went to buy seeds and peel catalpa bark, but he did not often go to the fields to lead production, and his inspection of the overall work was also insufficient. Everyone offered him many opinions. Zhang Jisheng said: "The deputy director's democratic work style is not enough. During the spring plowing, the cooperative did not have enough livestock, but he loaned out a horse without consulting with everyone." Chi Dianwen expressed his acceptance of everyone's opinions and his determination to overcome his shortcomings. Cui Hai, the head of the new farm tools group, reviewed his irresponsibility and lack of democratic work style. The new farm tools were not inspected and repaired before being used in the fields, and sometimes problems occurred in the fields, which were repaired temporarily, delaying work; when using the farm tools, he made all the decisions himself and did not accept the opinions of the masses. Liu Zuoyi gave him the opinion: "When the Western plow was being rained on, I suggested storing it, but Cui Hai said that it was good to let it rain, which is a manifestation of irresponsibility." Everyone also reviewed his implementation of the increased production competition plan. Chang Shigui said: "The item about taking on good apprentices was not completed." Cui Hai accepted these opinions and expressed his determination to correct his shortcomings and make achievements in summer hoeing. Gao Chenghe, the head of the sideline production group, and Liu Zuoyi, the head of the paddy field group, also reviewed the shortcomings in their work, and the members offered their opinions one by one. Because democracy was promoted, all members were very satisfied. Then, each member also carried out criticism and self-criticism. All members first criticized those members with a poor sense of the collective. Member Chi Dianwu was planting land for military dependents, and the group leader assigned him to hold the plow, but he wanted to sow seeds himself (which was lighter than holding the plow). After working for a day, he stopped working on the pretext of leg pain. Everyone said that this was a slacking off mentality and must be corrected. Member Gao Wenku always liked to pick light work. When spring plowing was in full swing, he said he was sick, stopped working, and went fishing by the river, but he still wanted to compete for work points. Everyone believed that this was a lack of a sense of the collective and selfishness. After everyone's criticism, he admitted his mistake. The selfish, self-interested, and uncaring attitude towards public property, as well as conservative thinking, were all criticized. Those with ideological problems began to recognize their shortcomings.

Due to the serious development of criticism and self-criticism, the members' thinking has taken a step forward. Everyone further realized that selfishness is shameful. Old member Yang Chengxue realized that he did less than others when spreading manure, and now he asked to have twenty-three points deducted. Everyone expressed their determination to overcome their shortcomings in summer hoeing.

In the cooperative, the vast majority of members (more than 80% of all members) who could actively produce, obey leadership, and obey collective interests were commended and rewarded. For example, Zhang Jisheng had leg pain, and in the past, he had never been in the water when planting paddy fields. This year, he took on the work in the paddy fields and has persisted from the beginning to the present without any complaints. Although Li Shuyun was sick, she actively participated in spring plowing labor. These people were elected as model members.

After this meeting, the supervisory and management committees further conducted inspections and selected six members to form a committee-based leadership structure. The cadres have all become active. The members' enthusiasm for labor has also increased. A new atmosphere has emerged throughout the cooperative. (Luo Yingmin, Jia Zhonglin)

    韩恩农业生产合作社
    在春耕评比中开展批评和自我批评
    进一步提高了社员的思想觉悟
    韩恩农业生产合作社自建社以来，社员们的集体主义思想逐渐增长，劳动热情空前高涨。但少数人在春耕过程中，还表现出散漫、保守和自私自利的思想作风。例如：在改良土壤时，社里需要铁锹、二齿子等小农具，有些社员家里有，却不肯拿出来。有少数社员干活时偷巧。有些社员不关心公共财产。为了帮助这个社的社员们在思想上提高一步，中共蛟河县县委工作组领导全体社员，开展了批评与自我批评。
    在开展批评和自我批评以前，先在合作社的监、理事会上进行讨论，又分别召开了党、团员会议和社员小组会，进行充分的思想酝酿。五月二十日召开了全社社员大会，进行春耕评比和检讨。评比的条件是：（一）劳动态度怎样；（二）个人利益是不是服从了国家、整体利益，还有那些自私自利表现；
    （三）对待公共财产是不是像爱护自己的财产一样。除此以外，干部还要检查领导作风。根据这几个条件，全体社员在干部领导下，都进行了自我检查和互相批评。副主任迟殿文先检讨了自己领导春耕时的事务主义作风。他说，买种子，剥楸树皮，他都是自己亲自去，但没有经常下地领导生产，对全面工作的检查也做得不够。大家对他提出许多意见。张继生说：“副主任民主作风不够。春耕时合作社的牲口不够用，但他没有和大家商量，就贷出去一匹马。”迟殿文表示接受大家的意见，坚决克服自己的缺点。新农具组长崔海检讨自己不负责任和缺乏民主作风。新农具下地前没有进行检修，有时在地里发生了毛病，临时修理，误了工；在使用农具时，都是自己说了算，不接受群众意见。刘作义给他提意见说：“洋犁叫雨淋着，我建议保管起来，崔海还说淋淋好，这是不负责的表现。”大家又检查了他执行增产竞赛计划的情况。常守贵说：“带好徒弟的那一条没有完成。”崔海接受了这些意见，表示要改正缺点，在夏锄中作出成绩来。副业组长高成和、水田组长刘作义也都检讨了自己工作中的缺点，社员都一一提出了意见。由于发扬了民主，全体社员都很满意。接着各个社员也展开了批评和自我批评。全体社员首先对整体观念较差的社员进行了批评。社员迟殿武给军属种地，组长分配他扶犁，他自己要点种（比扶犁轻），干了一天，又藉口腿疼歇工。大家说这是偷巧思想，一定要改正。社员郜文库总喜欢挑轻活，春耕正忙的时候，他说有病，歇了工，到河沿去钓鱼，但他还要争工分。大家认为这是没有整体观念和自私的表现。经过大家的批评，他承认了错误。少数人自私自利、不关心公共财产的思想和保守思想，都受到了批判。有思想毛病的人，开始认识了自己的缺点。
    由于认真地展开了批评和自我批评，社员们的思想都提高了一步。大家进一步认识到自私自利是可耻的。老社员杨成学想到在扬粪时比别人干的少，现在就要求减二十三分。大家都表示要在夏锄中克服缺点。
    在社里，能够积极生产，服从领导，服从整体利益的社员占绝大多数（占全体社员百分之八十以上），这些社员都受到了表扬和奖励。如张继生有腿疼病，过去种水田，从未下过水，今年他担任水田里的工作，从开始坚持到现在，从没发过怨言。李淑云虽然有病，还积极参加了春耕劳动。这些人当选了模范社员。
    这次会议以后，监、理事会又进一步作了检查，选出六名委员，组成委员制的领导机构。干部们都积极起来了。社员的劳动积极性也提高了。全社出现了新气象。    （罗颖民  贾忠林）
