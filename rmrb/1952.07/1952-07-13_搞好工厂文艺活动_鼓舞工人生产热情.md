Editor's Note: From the letters of readers Ping Ruifen, Li Yongnian, Zhao Shuren, and all the students of the Music Department of Yenching University, it can be seen that cultural activities that are loved by workers can play a certain role in boosting workers' production enthusiasm and promoting the production increase movement. When the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice thrift is launched, the cultural and educational departments of trade unions in various factories and mines should pay attention to this work.

Editor: During the large-scale campaign to increase production and practice thrift in Beijing, we felt that doing a good job in cultural activities could boost the production morale of the workers. During the "Three-Anti" movement, with the cooperation and promotion of the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union, our Second Sewing Department launched cultural activities, creating more than 20 songs, more than 10 rhythmic stories, a "Shadow Play," as well as storytelling with drum accompaniment, humorous dialogues, and skits for propaganda. When we performed the play "Degeneration" in the main factory, the masses said: It is really beneficial to see this play. These activities of the department not only did not affect production during the "Three-Anti" movement, but also boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers, and the production task was completed four days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by more than 2,000 hats.

During the "Three-Anti" movement, some departments in our factory used cultural propaganda, which played a role in promoting the movement. The record of the People's Daily Workers' Literature and Art Symposium also criticized leading cadres who did not pay attention to cultural activities. The Party, government, trade union, and Youth League of our factory have begun to pay attention to this issue. The Party, trade union, and Youth League have included cultural and sports activities in their work plans. We hope that everyone will pay attention to the role of factory cultural propaganda activities in promoting production.

Editor: Recently, many comrades from the Central Academy of Drama came to help us with cultural activities in the Chengzi Coal Mine, which made our entire mine lively. At the farewell party before they left, when they performed their newly created miner's dance for us, every worker liked it very much. But there are still very few such creations, and I hope that literary and art workers can create more works that inspire our workers' production enthusiasm.

Editor: Recently, the teachers and students of the Music Department of Yenching University went to the Shijingshan Power Plant to experience life and hold performances. Many workers sacrificed their sleep time to listen to our music. Some workers only slept for one hour in a day and a half to see our performances. When we talked with the worker comrades, they said: Literary and artistic works, especially those that coordinate with production, can give them great encouragement in production. They hope to see large-scale performances by professional literary and artistic groups.

How enthusiastically and eagerly the worker comrades yearn for cultural and recreational life after work! After going to the factory, we have all become more certain that literary and artistic workers should face the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and at the same time, we have begun to realize that literature and art can play such a big role in the production of the working people. At present, professional literary and art groups have not done enough in this regard, so we earnestly hope that professional literary and art groups can adopt various forms more and more extensively and flexibly to go to factories and the countryside to help the masses carry out cultural and recreational activities and performances.

### 搞好工厂文艺活动  鼓舞工人生产热情

    搞好工厂文艺活动
    鼓舞工人生产热情
    编者按：从读者平瑞芬、李永年、赵书仁以及燕京大学音乐系全体同学的来信中可以看出，为工人所喜爱的文艺活动，对鼓舞工人的生产热情、推动增产运动，是能够起一定的作用的。在全国开展增产节约竞赛的时候，各厂矿工会文教部门应该重视这个工作。
    编辑同志：在北京市展开大规模的增产节约竞赛运动的时候，我们觉得搞好文艺活动，是能够鼓舞工人们的生产情绪的。在“三反”运动中，我们第二缝纫部在党、团、工会的配合和推动下展开了文艺活动，创作了二十多首歌曲、十多个快板、一个“拉洋片”，还有西河大鼓、二人对口快板、双簧等进行宣传。我们在总厂演出“蜕化”这个剧时，群众说：看这一回戏得到的好处真不小。该部的这些活动在“三反”中不但没有影响生产，反而鼓舞了工人们的生产热情，生产任务提前四天完成，超额缝制了二千多顶帽子。
    在“三反”运动中，我厂有的部门运用文艺宣传，对运动起了推动作用。人民日报工人文艺座谈会记录又对不重视文艺活动的领导干部进行了批评。我们厂的党、政、工、团已开始重视这个问题了。党、工、团已把文艺体育活动列入工作计划。我们希望大家重视工厂文艺宣传活动对生产的推动作用。

    编辑同志：最近中央戏剧学院许多同志来帮助我们城子煤矿搞文艺活动，使我们整个矿场都活跃起来了。他们在临别欢送大会上，给我们演出他们新创作的矿工舞时，每个工人都非常喜欢。但是这种创作现在还是很少，希望文艺工作者能够多创作鼓舞我们工人生产热情的作品。    赵书仁
    编辑同志：我们燕京大学音乐系的师生最近到石景山发电厂体验生活并举行演出。许多工人都牺牲了睡眠时间来听我们的音乐。个别工人为了看我们的演出，一天半只睡了一个钟头。在我们和工人同志们谈话时，他们说：文艺作品，特别是配合生产的文艺作品能给他们生产极大的鼓舞。他们希望能看到文艺专业团体的大型演出。
    工人同志在劳动之余是多么热烈和迫切地渴求着文娱生活呵！经过下厂以后，我们都更肯定了文艺工作者应面向工农兵的方向，同时也开始了解到文艺对劳动人民的生产能起那么大的作用。目前文艺专业团体在这方面做得还不够，所以我们恳切地希望文艺专业团体能更多更普遍灵活地采取各种形式下厂下乡，去帮助群众开展文娱活动与演出。
    燕京大学音乐系全体同学
