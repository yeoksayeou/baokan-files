New Records on the Production Front

    Improved Labor Organization Exceeds Excavation Plan
    The area where the No. 1 Engineering Team of a certain engineering construction office of the Hebei Provincial Company of the China Communications Construction Corporation was carrying out grooving work was a clay soil area. The soil was tightly packed and sticky, with occasional clay stones, making excavation difficult. It was necessary to use a pickaxe first and then a shovel, otherwise the shovel wouldn't move. Adapting to these soil characteristics, they used advanced operating methods and improved labor organization, finally setting a new record. On the first day, twenty-seven people (including two indirect workers) were supposed to complete a total of 81 cubic meters according to the design; the actual total completed was 138.24 cubic meters. On the second day, seven people dug a total of 45.3 cubic meters, completing 216 percent of the plan.

    He Gang's Lv Wenping Coal Mining Team Sets New Record
    The Lv Wenping mechanized coal mining team of the Education Pit of the Nanshan Mining Bureau in Hegang Mining Administration, in the nineteen days from May 3rd to 21st, broke the ten thousand ton mark in coal production, setting a new record of an average daily output of 542.7 tons from the coal cutting machine site. The reasons for Lv Wenping's team's achievement were: first, they started implementing a cyclical chart system from December of last year, with each type of work being carried out rhythmically and regularly according to the chart, eliminating idle work. Second, they rationally organized the labor force and implemented specialized division of labor, enabling everyone to study their profession and improve their skills. Therefore, they not only created a new coal mining record, but also ensured the quality of products and projects.

    Workers at Southwest Plant 103 Improve Operating Methods
    Workers Liu Yueliang, Liu Qingquan, labor model Huang Huaqing, and others at Southwest Plant 103 collectively improved operating techniques, allowing a certain type of blast furnace to continue operating from 3:00 PM on May 13th, when it was ignited and started, until the end of the month. It has already exceeded the plant's quota time (48 hours). In the past, the furnace body was prone to condensing zinc ash, making it impossible to add materials and blow air, thus reducing the temperature inside the furnace, and requiring a shutdown after a maximum of two days.

    The Creations of Cao Wensen's Group at the Beijing Machine Factory
    Cao Wensen's scraping team in the fitter department of the Beijing Machine Factory, after collectively creating a method of rotating scraping to increase production efficiency by seven times when scraping the ram of a shaper in May, were assigned the task of scraping parts for eleven shapers in early June. They created three types of tools for scraping the cross slide and the ram, resulting in the completion of a project originally planned to take 5370.5 work hours in only 1703.5 work hours, saving 3667 work hours.

    Huanggu Village Locomotive Depot Finds the Key
    Employees of the Huanggu Village Locomotive Depot of the Jinzhou Railway Administration found more than fifty kinds of "keys" in the movement of full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometers; when washing and inspecting locomotive ㄉㄎ No. 27 on May 26, they adopted the advanced double-pump cooling method, double-layer cross-operation method, and new oil quality ignition method, completing the washing and inspection in only five and a half hours, shortening the Ministry of Railways' standard of twenty-one hours by fifteen and a half hours, and shortening the Jinzhou Railway Administration's standard of thirteen hours by seven and a half hours, setting a new national record for washing and inspecting locomotives.

    生产战线上的新纪录
    改进劳动组织超额完成挖土计划
    中国交通建设企业总公司河北省公司某工程施工处第一工程队进行刨槽工作的地区，是胶泥土区，泥土紧粘，间有胶石，刨挖困难，必须先镐后锨，否则锨不动。他们适合这种土质特点，运用了先进操作法，又改进了劳动组织，终于创造了新纪录。第一天二十七人（内间接工二人），按设计共应完成八十一立方；结果共完成一百三十八点二四立方。第二天七个人共挖四十五点三立方，完成了百分之二百十六。

    鹤岗吕文平采煤班创新纪录
    鹤岗矿务局南山矿教育坑吕文平机械化采煤班，在五月三日到二十一日的十九天中，采煤产量突破万吨，创截煤机场子平均日产五百四十二点七吨的新纪录。吕文平班获得以上成绩的原因：一，从去年十二月起开始实行循环图表制，各工种按照图表有节奏地正规地进行作业，消灭了窝工现象。二，合理地组织了劳动力，实行专业化的分工，使每人都可以钻研业务提高技术。因此，他们不但创造了采煤新纪录，并且保证了产品和工程的质量。

　　西南一○三厂工人改进操作方法
    西南一○三厂工人刘月良、刘清泉、劳动模范黄华清等，集体改进操作技术，使某号鼓风炉从五月十三号晚上三点钟发火开炉起一直开到月底为止，还在继续开。已超过了本厂的定额时间（四十八小时）。而过去由于炉身容易凝结锌灰，便无法加料打风，因此降低了炉内温度，最多两天时间就得停炉。（汪洗遗）
    北京机器厂曹文森小组的创造
    北京机器厂钳工部曹文森刮研小组，继五月份刮研牛头刨床集体创造了轮换刮研法提高生产效率七倍以后，在六月上旬担负刮研十一部牛头刨零件任务时，又创造了刮横刀架子和牛头的三种刀具，结果使原计划用五千三百七十点五工时的工程，仅用一千七百零三点五工时就完成了，节省了三千六百六十七个工时。（郑文友）
    皇姑屯机务段找到了窍门
    锦州铁路管理局皇姑屯机务段职工，在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，找出了五十多种“窍门”；在五月二十六日洗检ㄉㄎ二七号机车时，采用了先进的双泵减温法、双层横作业法和新油质点火法，只用了五个半小时就洗检完毕，比铁道部规定标准二十一小时缩短了十五个半小时，比锦州铁路管理局规定标准十三小时缩短了七个半小时，创造了全国洗检机车最新纪录。    （张成忠）
