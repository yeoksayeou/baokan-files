    Excellent Medical Worker - Qu Jing
    Comrade Editor: Qu Jing, a young nurse at a hospital of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, is an excellent medical worker. She is only nineteen years old this year.
    In April 1951, enemy planes frantically bombed the rear of Korea. The higher authorities ordered a certain hospital to move to a safe area. At that time, three of the four nurses in the hospital were sick. The instructor and a doctor first transported the medicines away, leaving Qu Jing alone to take care of the wounded. Before leaving, the instructor instructed: "Little Qu, you must be responsible for protecting the remaining medicines and the dozen or so wounded and sick soldiers!" Qu Jing resolutely replied: "With me here, I guarantee that the medicines and the wounded will not be lost. Instructor, please rest assured!"
    During the day, in her busy work, she squeezed out time to disperse and store dozens of boxes of medicines weighing sixty or seventy pounds each. In the evening, she was feeding the wounded when enemy planes came. A bomb landed near the hospital, and the house next door caught fire. Soil and thick smoke poured into the ward. She carried a seriously wounded soldier on her back and shouted to the other wounded and sick soldiers: "Comrades, follow me." She walked through the thick smoke to a safe area and found that the other wounded had not followed. She turned and rushed into the smoke and fire. The thick smoke stung her eyes and made it difficult for her to breathe. She desperately shouted: "Comrades, where are you!" However, the sound of the bomb explosions drowned out her voice. Her throat became hoarse, but there was still no response. Later, the smoke slowly dissipated, and she took a wooden stick to dig through the loose soil next to the bomb crater. Suddenly, she heard someone shout, "Little Qu!" She widened her eyes, which were red and swollen from the smoke and fire, and hoarsely shouted, "Comrade, where are you?" At this time, she saw a wounded soldier walking towards her on crutches. She rushed over and repeatedly asked: "What about them? What about them?" The other wounded soldiers had all gone into an air-raid shelter.
    After the enemy planes left, she settled the wounded in a safe place. She was extremely tired, but she did not rest and went to check the places where the medicines were hidden. By the time the instructor and the doctor returned, she had been awake for two nights and hadn't eaten for a day. But she still worked with such energy.
    At this moment, a Korean woman who had been injured in the bombing was brought to the hospital. The patient had lost too much blood, and her condition was dangerous, requiring an immediate blood transfusion. Comrade Qu Jing resolutely requested to donate 100 cc of blood to the patient. The doctor said she was too young and wouldn't allow her to give blood. She excitedly said: "So many soldiers are bleeding and sacrificing on the front lines, what reason is there not to allow me to donate blood!" The doctor finally drew 100 cc of blood from her. At this time, she felt dizzy and her body was a little unsteady. However, she didn't say a word. She knew that if the instructor knew about this, he would definitely let her rest, and resting for one minute would mean one minute less of work. She supported herself to the operating room to help the doctor prepare the instruments for the operation and finally fainted.
    A few days later, the chairman of the local Korean People's Government committee visited her and gave the hospital a letter of thanks. The letter said: "Thank you to Chairman Mao Zedong, thank you to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army trained by Chairman Mao Zedong. The Korean mothers and children will never forget the Chinese people who saved them with their own blood."
    Comrade Qu Jing takes great care in nursing the wounded and sick soldiers. She is busy all day washing wounds and clothes for the wounded and sick soldiers. Some wounded and sick soldiers cannot eat, and she feeds them mouthful by mouthful. In the evening, she always goes to the wards to cover the wounded and sick soldiers with quilts or do other things. She rarely rests. This brotherly care of hers greatly moves the wounded and sick soldiers. Everyone affectionately calls her "Little Qu."
    Comrade Qu Jing pays great attention to helping the wounded and sick soldiers spiritually. She said: "A medical worker should not only help the wounded and sick soldiers recover their health physically, but also keep them healthy in their thinking." In April of this year, a wounded soldier was in low spirits due to the intense pain of his wound. She told him the story of Zhao Guilan. After listening, the wounded soldier smiled and said: "Little Qu, I want to learn from Zhao Guilan!"
    Little Qu is an excellent Chinese daughter who was selected as a model member of the Youth League and a model group leader of the trade union last year, and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. What power makes her work tirelessly? She said: "The Party gave me the power. I feel at all times that the Party is saying to me: Now is the time to test you, and I am immediately filled with strength."

    优秀的医务工作者——曲镜
    编辑同志：中国人民志愿军铁道部队某病院小护士曲镜同志，是一个优秀的医务工作者。她今年才十九岁。
    一九五一年四月，敌机疯狂地轰炸朝鲜后方。上级命令某病院转移到安全地带。当时，病院里四个护士，病倒了三个。指导员和一个医生先把药品运走，留下曲镜一个人照顾伤员。指导员临走时嘱咐说：“小曲，剩下的药品和十几个伤病员，一定要负责保护好！”曲镜坚决地回答：“有我在，保证药品和伤员不受损失。指导员，请放心！”	
    当天白天，她在繁忙的工作中，挤出时间，把几十箱六、七十斤重的药品，分别疏散保存起来。晚上，她正在给伤员喂饭，敌机来了。一颗炸弹落在病院附近，隔壁的房子烧起来了。土块和浓烟拥进病房。她背起一个重伤员，并向其他伤病员喊道：“同志们，跟我来。”她穿过浓烟，走到安全地带，发现其他伤员都没有跟出来。她转身冲进烟火中。浓烟熏得她眼睛发疼，使她透不过气来。她拼命地叫：“同志们，你们在那儿！”但是，炸弹爆炸的声音，淹没了她的声音。她的嗓子嘶哑了，还是没有回音。后来，烟雾慢慢散开，她拿着一根木棒，去挖炸弹坑旁的浮土。突然，她听见有人喊：“小曲！”她张大了被烟火熏得红肿了的眼睛，嘶哑地喊：“同志，在那儿？”这时，她看见一个伤员，拄着拐杖，向她走来。她扑过去，连声地问：“他们呢？他们呢？”其他伤员都走进一个防空洞去了。
    敌机走了，她把伤员安置在安全的地方。她已经疲乏极了，但她没有休息，又到隐蔽药品的地方检查了一遍。在指导员和大夫回来时，她已经两夜没合眼，一天没吃饭了。但她仍旧工作得那么有劲儿。
    正在这个时候，一个被炸伤的朝鲜妇女被送到病院来了。病人流血过多，情况危险，需要立刻输血。曲镜同志坚决要求给病人输血一百西西。医生说她年纪太小，不许她抽血。她激动地说：“在前线多少战士流血牺牲，有什么理由不许我抽血！”医生终于在她身上抽了一百西西血。这时她头脑发晕，身体有些支持不住。但是，她没有作声。她知道，指导员知道了这种情况，一定让她休息，而休息一分钟，就要少做一分钟的工作。她支撑着到手术室帮助医生准备好动手术的用具，终于昏倒了。
    几天后，当地朝鲜人民政府里委员长慰问了她，并给病院一封感谢信。信里说：“感谢毛泽东主席，感谢毛泽东主席培养出来的中国人民志愿军。朝鲜的妈妈和孩子永远不会忘记用自己的血来救了她们的中国人民。”
    曲镜同志护理伤病员十分尽心。她整天忙着替伤病员洗伤口、洗衣服。有些伤病员不能吃饭，她一口一口地喂他们。晚上，她总是到病房里替伤病员盖被子或做其他的事。她很少休息。她这种兄弟般的关怀，使伤病员们都很感动。大家都亲热地叫她
    “小曲”。
    曲镜同志十分注意从精神上来帮助伤病员。她说：“一个医务工作者不但应当让伤病员身体恢复健康，并且还要使伤病员思想上也保持健康。”今年四月，一个伤员因伤口激痛，情绪很低。她就讲赵桂兰的故事给他听。这个伤员听完了，微笑着说：“小曲，我要向赵桂兰学习！”
    小曲是个优秀的中华女儿，在去年曾被选为青年团模范团员，工会模范小组长，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。什么力量使她不倦地工作呢？她说：“是党给了我力量。我时时刻刻觉得党对我说：现在正是考验你的时候，我立刻全身充满了力量。”
