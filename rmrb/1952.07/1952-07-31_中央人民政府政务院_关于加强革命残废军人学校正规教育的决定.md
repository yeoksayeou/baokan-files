The revolutionary disabled soldiers were gloriously wounded in the revolutionary war, resulting in disabilities. They are generally young, politically conscious, have a low level of education, and have a strong desire to learn. Many of them are lightly disabled, and although they have lost some of their health, it does not hinder the development of their working ability. In addition to providing preferential treatment and pensions to these revolutionary disabled soldiers, the state should actively educate them and cultivate them into various construction talents for the new China. In the past, although schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers have been established in various places, some places have not treated it as a cause for cultivating construction talents, and there is a phenomenon of emphasizing support over education, and even mistakenly thinking that it is a burden. This is neither in line with the needs of national construction nor in line with the requirements of the majority of revolutionary disabled soldiers, and it is incorrect. In order to correct this phenomenon and strengthen regular education in schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers, the following decisions are made:

    I. The School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers is established to cultivate and improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of revolutionary disabled soldiers so that they can continue their studies and become various construction talents of the country. This type of school is equivalent to workers' and peasants' quick-course middle schools and workers' and peasants' quick-course primary schools in the education system of the People's Republic of China. Existing schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers that have not yet conducted regular education should be reformed in accordance with this decision so that they can assume the responsibility of educating and cultivating revolutionary disabled soldiers.

    II. Schools for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers shall be run by the Provincial (Administrative Office) People's Government, and the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee) may also establish them as needed. In terms of leadership, the civil affairs department is responsible for administrative leadership, and the education department is responsible for assisting and guiding its teaching business, reviewing materials, and matters such as enrollment and transfer; regarding the allocation of teachers, the personnel department and the education department should make appropriate adjustments and resolutions.

    III. The current students of the Schools for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, and the revolutionary disabled soldiers who have not yet completed their return to their hometowns and transferred to other occupations, except for those who are severely disabled and unsuitable for regular study, who should be sent to the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium for care, regardless of gender, age, or position, with the approval of the civil affairs department of the people's government above the provincial level, can be assigned to the appropriate classes of regular schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers according to their educational level. The length of schooling and teaching plans of this type of school shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government regarding workers' and peasants' quick-course middle schools and workers' and peasants' quick-course primary schools. After graduation, students will continue their studies according to the needs of national construction and personal aspirations, and those who are suitable for work will be assigned jobs by the personnel department.

    IV. Students of the School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers should generally not be transferred during their studies, but when they have obtained a certain level of cultural knowledge, with the approval of the leadership, they may transfer to appropriate technical schools or professional training courses so that they can find employment as soon as possible to meet the needs of national construction. When various departments are running technical schools and professional training courses, they should give priority to enrollment under the same conditions.

    V. The School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers adopts the system of principal responsibility. There is one principal who presides over the work of the entire school, and vice principals may be appointed when necessary. Depending on the needs of the work, two departments, teaching and general affairs, may be set up to preside over teaching and general affairs work respectively. The candidates for the principal, vice principal, and directors of teaching and general affairs shall be appointed by the civil affairs department in consultation with the personnel and education departments. The organizational structure of the school can refer to the establishment of workers' and peasants' quick-course middle schools and workers' and peasants' quick-course primary schools, and should be equipped with a certain quality and quantity of political workers.

    VI. The funds of the School for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers will be temporarily paid from the special funds for preferential treatment, and the supply standard for students' living and teaching expenses shall be based on the principle of meeting the needs of regular teaching. The specific standards shall be formulated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government in consultation with the Ministry of Finance.

    VII. The Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee) shall formulate specific implementation measures based on this decision and in light of the actual situation in various places, and submit them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定
    革命残废军人在革命战争中光荣负伤，致成残废。他们一般是年龄轻，政治觉悟高，文化程度低，学习要求热烈，其中有许多是轻残废，虽然失去了部分的健康，但并不妨碍其工作能力的发展。对于这些革命残废军人，国家除予以优待抚恤外，并应积极进行教育，培养他们成为新中国的各种建设人才。过去各地虽已设立了革命残废军人学校，但有些地方还没有把它当作培养建设人才的事业办，存在着只重养不重教的现象，甚至错误地认为是负担。这既不符合国家建设的需要，也不符合多数革命残废军人的要求，是不正确的。为了纠正这种现象，并加强革命残废军人学校正规教育，特作如下决定：
    一、革命残废军人学校是为培养与提高革命残废军人的文化与科学知识，使能继续深造，成为国家各种建设人才而设立的。此种学校在中华人民共和国学制中相当于工农速成中学和工农速成初等学校。现有的尚未进行正规教育的革命残废军人学校，应根据本决定加以改革，使其能担负教育培养革命残废军人的责任。
    二、革命残废军人学校，应由省（行署）人民政府办理，大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）视情况需要亦可设立。其领导关系，由民政部门负行政领导之责，教育部门负责协助并指导其教学业务、审定材料及升学转学等事宜；关于师资配备，应由人事部门教育部门适当调整解决。
    三、革命残废军人学校之现有学员，与尚未办理回乡转业之革命残废军人，除不适宜正规学习之重残废应送入革命残废军人教养院教养外，不分性别、年龄、职别，经省以上人民政府民政部门批准，均得按文化程度编入正规的革命残废军人学校中之适当班次。此种学校的修业年限和教学计划应按照中央人民政府教育部关于工农速成中学和工农速成初等学校的规定办理。学员毕业后，按国家建设需要与个人志愿分别升学深造，其适于工作者，统一由人事部门分配工作。
    四、革命残废军人学校之学员，在学习期间，一般不宜抽调，但在获得一定的文化知识时，经领导批准，得转入适当的技术学校或专业训练班，使能早日就业，以适应国家建设的需要。各部门办理技术学校及专业训练班招生时，在同等条件下应优先录取。
    五、革命残废军人学校，采用校长负责制。设校长一人，主持全校工作，必要时得设副职。视工作需要可设教导与总务两部门，分别主持教导与总务工作。正副校长与教导、总务主任之人选，由民政部门商同人事部门教育部门委任之。学校的组织机构可参照工农速成中学和工农速成初等学校的编制，并应配备一定质量与数量的政治工作人员。
    六、革命残废军人学校的经费，暂由优抚事业费项内开支，学员生活及教学经费供给标准，以适应正规教学需要为原则，具体标准由中央人民政府内务部商同财政部制定之。
    七、各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）的民政部应根据本决定并参酌各地实际情况，制定具体实施办法，报经中央人民政府内务部批准施行。
             一九五二年七月二十四日
