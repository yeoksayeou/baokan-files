The Use of New Agricultural Implements is an Important Factor in Increasing Agricultural Production
Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Northeast People's Government Zhang Kewei

In the past three years, the work of testing and promoting new-style agricultural implements in the Northeast region has achieved preliminary results, which proves that the use of new agricultural implements is the most effective way to improve agricultural productivity.

According to incomplete statistics, the Northeast region promoted 13,021 sets of various new-style agricultural implements in 1951, of which Soviet-style horse-drawn agricultural implements accounted for 23 percent.

Benefits of Using New Agricultural Implements

According to the specific cases and typical experiences of using new agricultural implements in various places, the use of new agricultural implements has the following benefits:

1. Increased Yield per Unit Area. According to materials from six agricultural experiment stations and more than sixty mutual aid groups using new agricultural implements, the land using new agricultural implements generally increased production by about 25 percent on average. A comparison of the yields of new and old agricultural implements used by the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station in the three years from 1949 to 1951 is as follows (other farming conditions being the same): the average yield per hectare of soybeans, wheat, upland rice, millet, and sorghum planted using new agricultural implements was 1,613.2 kilograms, while the average yield per hectare of the same types of crops using old agricultural implements was only 1,339.9 kilograms, i.e., the use of new agricultural implements increased production by 20.4 percent compared to the use of old agricultural implements; looking at the yield increase rate of each crop, wheat increased by 72 percent, upland rice increased by 65 percent, millet increased by 33.5 percent, soybeans increased by 10.3 percent, and sorghum increased by 10 percent. In 1949, the average yield per hectare of the experimental land using new agricultural implements in the Keshan Experiment Station of Heilongjiang was 1,962 kilograms, and the average yield per hectare of the experimental land using old agricultural implements was 1,500 kilograms, i.e., the land using new agricultural implements increased production by 30.8 percent. Forty-two mutual aid groups in Jixian County, Songjiang Province, used new agricultural implements to plant soybeans, and in 1951, under abnormal weather conditions, the average yield per hectare was 1,500 kilograms, about 30 percent higher than the local general soybean yield. The He Fengshan group in Yushu County, Jilin Province, used new agricultural implements for cultivation in 1950, which increased production by 12 to 15 percent compared to the use of old agricultural implements. In 1951, the average yield per hectare of wheat cultivated with new agricultural implements increased by 40 percent compared to that cultivated with old agricultural implements. In 1951, the Chang Fengwu group in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, used Soviet-style horse-drawn plows to turn the soil, sowing machines to sow wheat, and harvesters to harvest wheat in a timely manner at wheat harvest, which increased production by 30 percent compared to the use of old agricultural implements, and the quality of the wheat produced was also better than that of wheat planted with old agricultural implements.

2. Deep Plowing and Fine Cultivation, Resistant to Drought and Waterlogging. The Sun Hai, Li Xichun, and Yao Yonglin mutual aid groups in Panshi County, Jilin Province, used Soviet-style horse-drawn plows to plow the land to a depth of 16 centimeters, and implemented harrowing and compaction, resulting in loose soil, easy penetration of rainwater, deep roots of crops, and no lodging in case of wind and rain; the land implemented with flat cultivation (i.e., not ridging when planting) with new agricultural implements was ridged as it was cultivated, and the roots of seedlings were cultivated higher and higher, which could maintain a certain amount of moisture, so the crops could resist drought and waterlogging. Before the second cultivation, the seedlings in the high cultivation land (i.e., ridging when planting, planting crops on the ridges) of the three groups were higher than those in the flat cultivation land, but by the third cultivation, the crops in the flat cultivation land were three or four inches higher than those in the high cultivation land. Ordinary farmers say, "After all, the crops of new agricultural implements have staying power!" Liu Wenbin of Jixian County, Songjiang Province, harvested 2,130 kilograms from his 8.5 mu of wheat land because he plowed the land with a double-wheeled single-furrow plow the previous year to a depth of 16 centimeters, then harrowed it with a disc harrow, compacted it with a compactor, and finally sowed it with a ten-row sowing machine. When the seedlings first emerged, they grew neatly and vigorously; the seedlings turned slightly yellow during the first cultivation, but turned around during the second cultivation, and then were stronger than the crops cultivated with old agricultural implements. In 1951, the Wang Yongzhen group used Soviet-style horse-drawn plows to open 22 hectares of hazel scrub wasteland and harrowed it with a disc harrow once, of which 15 hectares were sown with soybeans using a sowing machine. The soybeans grew to two feet seven or eight inches tall, yielding 2,150 kilograms per hectare, with full grains, and matured six or seven days earlier than the local soybeans. During the harvest, group member Zhao Jun said to Old Wang, who came to visit, "Didn't you say in the spring that it was not possible to grow soybeans in hazel scrub wasteland in the first year? How do you say the soybeans are growing well now?" Old Wang said:
    "Alas! The old ways don't work anymore, new agricultural implements are still good!"

3. Saves Labor, Saves Labor and Produces Work. When the He Fengshan mutual aid group in Yushu County, Jilin Province, used old agricultural implements to plant land during the spring plowing, horse labor accounted for 56 percent and manual labor accounted for 44 percent. When planting land with new agricultural implements, horse labor accounted for 74 percent and manual labor accounted for 26 percent. When using old agricultural implements for summer hoeing, people were busy and horses were idle. After switching to new agricultural implements, it became either people were busy and horses were also busy, or horses were busy and people were not busy. From spring plowing to summer hoeing, the Sun Hai mutual aid group in Panshi County, Jilin Province, used 11 man-days and 11 animal-days per hectare of land with new agricultural implements, and 20 man-days and 9 animal-days per hectare of land with old agricultural implements, i.e., planting one hectare of land with new agricultural implements saved 9 man-days and used 2 more animal-days than planting with old agricultural implements; the use of new agricultural implements in spring plowing emphasized deep plowing and fine harrowing, which used one more man-day and three more animal-days per hectare than cultivation with old agricultural implements, but in summer hoeing, it saved 10 man-days and one animal-day per hectare than cultivation with old agricultural implements, which could adjust the shortage of manual labor during summer hoeing. Old agricultural implements were used for simultaneous plowing and planting; new agricultural implements could be used to plow and harrow the land first, and the labor force could be divided up evenly, so that planting could be carried out immediately during the planting season, shortening the planting time. The Sun Hai group used new agricultural implements for spring plowing, which shortened the time by six days compared to using old agricultural implements, and also shortened the time by seven days during summer hoeing compared to using old agricultural implements. The work efficiency of other new agricultural implements, such as sowing machines, is that two people and four horses can sow four hectares of land in one day, which saves more than a dozen man-days and horse-days compared to using old agricultural implements; harvesting wheat with harvesters, eight people and four horses can harvest five hectares in one day, which is at least two or three times more efficient than harvesting with sickles; the efficiency of threshing machines and grain separators is three to five times higher than that of old agricultural implements; the integrated shoveling and harrowing machine is also one to one and a half times more efficient than old agricultural implements, achieving more shoveling and more harrowing. In addition, the use of new-style agricultural implements is also conducive to expanding the cultivated area. For example, the Liu Wenbin mutual aid group used new agricultural implements to expand the cultivated area by 60 percent in 1951, with each laborer bearing an average of 7.1 hectares of cultivated land (each laborer in the local area only bears 3.4 hectares); the Wang Zhentang mutual aid group used a complete set of Soviet-style horse-drawn agricultural implements in 1950, saving a total of 1,410 workdays and opening 97 hectares of wasteland; the Wang Zhijian mutual aid group used new agricultural implements to plant 84 hectares of land in 1950 and expanded to 165 hectares in 1951.

Main Reasons for Increased Production with New Agricultural Implements

1. The land cultivated with old agricultural implements has become hard and lost the granular structure of the soil after more than half a year of natural pressure and the influence of rain and snow from the last shoveling in autumn until the spring plowing of the following year. Some viscous soils harden in such a long time, and rainwater cannot seep down, losing the ability to retain moisture and are not suitable for crop growth. The granular structure of the soil is the various soil aggregates of different sizes formed by the combination of soil particles. These fine-grained soil aggregates are mixed with humus colloids, so that many micropores can retain nutrients and absorb moisture, and also allow "aerobic bacteria" to have the opportunity to reproduce. These bacteria have the function of decomposing organic matter into inorganic compounds for crop absorption. These functions must be fully utilized after the soil is deeply cultivated, harrowed, pulverized, and loosened with new agricultural implements. Because new agricultural implements have a good effect of maintaining and forming the granular structure of the soil, they can increase soil fertility, thus increasing the yield per unit area. This is one of the main reasons why the use of new agricultural implements can increase production.

2. New agricultural implements plow deeply and cover the soil tightly, which can deeply bury weeds, weed seeds, and plant remains in the soil. These things can increase soil fertility after being decomposed. New agricultural implements can also turn the underground pests and pupae to the ground, causing them to die after being frozen and exposed to the sun.

3. The land using new agricultural implements has denser crops, grows evenly, and seedlings can fully utilize the soil fertility without blank areas, which can increase yield. The Jilin Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station conducted experiments on row spacing and plant spacing, proving that appropriate dense planting with new agricultural implements increased the yield by 17 percent compared to land using old agricultural implements with large ridges and wide rows; demonstration farms in eight counties, including Helong and Huaide in Jilin Province, also proved that new agricultural implements can increase production by 43 percent in dense planting and old agricultural implements in large ridges and wide rows. The land planted with new agricultural implements is mostly flat cultivation; and flat cultivation has a better effect on maintaining constant temperature and storing moisture than high cultivation. High ridges radiate heat and moisture on three sides, unlike flat cultivation, which has a small radiation surface. Therefore, the soil temperature of high ridges is lower than that of flat cultivation at night; although the soil temperature of high ridges is higher than that of flat cultivation at noon, it drops again at night, and the soil temperature changes greatly between day and night, which is not conducive to crop growth. The soil temperature of flat cultivation does not change too high or too low, and it is also better than high cultivation in absorbing moisture and preventing evaporation.

Several Things to Pay Attention to in the Future

1. In the past, when experimenting and promoting new agricultural implements, two obstacles were encountered: "conservative thinking" and "lack of technical knowledge." In response to this situation, leaders at all levels should seize typical examples, do a good job in demonstration and promotion station work, and organize farmers to visit, so that they can recognize the superiority of production using new agricultural implements. At the same time, they should combine it with education on the direction of production, so that farmers can recognize that the use of new agricultural implements is preparing the foundation for future agricultural mechanization and collectivization. Attention should also be paid to solving the technical problems of using new agricultural implements. Because new agricultural implements are more complex than old agricultural implements, farmers cannot quickly become familiar with them. Some farmers were so anxious that they were sweating profusely because they did not know how to use new agricultural implements; and village cadres did not understand the technology and only carried out political mobilization on the side, which not only did not solve the technical problems, but also aroused the dissatisfaction of the farmers. Therefore, in the future, in addition to using training classes to conduct political education and technical training for farmers, rural cadres should also be taught the technology of using new agricultural implements. This is a very important task in promoting new agricultural implements.

2. The use of new agricultural implements should be combined with the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. New agricultural implements must first be loaned or sold to good mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. After the new agricultural implements are distributed, we should start to help the mutual aid groups adjust their organizations. In 1951, all mutual aid groups that made adjustments according to the needs of using new agricultural implements had their new agricultural implements' effects brought into play, and production was also significantly improved, and the mutual aid groups were thus consolidated and improved. In accordance with the performance of new agricultural implements and the policy of gradually promoting them in large quantities in the future, farmers should be consciously educated within the mutual aid groups in the future, so that they can "connect the land" and cooperate in the use of new agricultural implements under voluntary circumstances.

3. The promotion of new agricultural implements must be combined with the improvement of farming methods. New agricultural implements not only save labor and produce work, but more importantly, they can deeply cultivate and finely cultivate the land. However, some farmers use new agricultural implements only to satisfy the fast efficiency of sowing and harvesting, and the ability to open up wasteland, while ignoring the improvement of farming methods on cultivated land. In the future, when promoting new agricultural implements, we must improve farming methods and implement the production policy of increasing the yield per unit area.

4. The manufacturing of new agricultural implements should be as standardized as possible. New-style agricultural implements are new things, and we lack experience in making them, the manufacturing equipment is also simple, and even the specifications of raw materials are sometimes different, resulting in many difficulties. However, we must manufacture new-style agricultural implements well and strictly prevent shoddy manufacturing. Only by manufacturing new agricultural implements that meet the specifications can they be promoted and can the purpose of increasing production and improving people's lives be achieved. Therefore, manufacturing new agricultural implements that meet the specifications is a serious political task for every state-owned agricultural implement factory.

    使用新农具是增加农业生产的重要因素
    东北人民政府农业部副部长    张克威
    三年来，东北区试用和推广新式农具的工作已经有了初步成绩，这证明了使用新农具是提高农业生产力的最有效的办法。
    据不完全统计，东北区在一九五一年就推广了各种新式农具一万三千零二十一台，其中苏联式马拉农具占百分之二十三。使用新农具的益处
    根据各地使用新农具的具体事例和典型经验看来，使用新农具有以下益处：1、提高了单位面积产量。据六个农业试验场和六十多个互助组使用新农具的材料，使用新农具的土地，总平均增产百分之二十五左右。吉林省农业试验场一九四九年至一九五一年三年内使用新旧农具的产量比较如下（其他耕作条件相同）：使用新农具种的大豆、小麦、陆稻、谷子、高粱，每垧平均产量为一千六百一十三点二公斤，而使用旧农具的同种类作物，每垧平均仅产一千三百三十九点九公斤，即使用新农具较使用旧农具增产百分之二十点四；从其中每种作物的增产率来看，小麦增产百分之七十二，陆稻增产百分之六十五，谷子增产百分之三十三点五，大豆增产百分之十点三，高粱增产百分之十。黑龙江克山试验场一九四九年使用新农具的试验地，平均每垧产量为一千九百六十二公斤，使用旧农具的试验地，平均每垧产量为一千五百公斤，即使用新农具的土地增产百分之三十点八。松江省集贤县四十二个互助组使用新农具种植大豆，一九五一年在气候不正常的情况下，平均每垧产量为一千五百公斤，约超过当地一般大豆产量百分之三十。吉林省榆树县何凤山组，一九五零年使用新农具耕种，比使用旧农具增产百分之十二至十五。一九五一年用新农具耕作的小麦，每垧平均产量比用旧农具耕种的增产百分之四十。松江省桦川县常凤舞组一九五一年用苏联式马拉犁翻地，用播种机播小麦，麦收时用收割机及时收割，比使用旧农具时增产百分之三十，所产小麦的质量也比用旧农具种的小麦好。
    2、能深耕细作，抗旱抗涝。吉林省磐石县孙海、李喜春、姚永林三个互助组，用苏联式马拉犁翻地深达十六公分，并实行了耙地和镇压，结果土发松，雨水易渗透，庄稼根须扎得深，遇到风雨不倒伏；用新农具实行平作（即在种地时不起垅）的地随铲随起垅，苗根土越培越高，能保持一定的水分，因此庄稼能抗旱抗涝。三个组的庄稼在铲趟二遍以前，用旧农具高作（即种地时起垅，把庄稼种在垅上）的地里的小苗比平作的高，但到铲趟三遍时，平作的庄稼就比高作的庄稼高三四寸了。一般农民都说：“到底是新农具的庄稼有后劲！”松江省集贤县刘文彬的八亩五分麦地收了二千一百三十公斤，是因为在头年用双轮一铧犁翻了一遍地，深达十六公分，随后用圆盘耙耙了一下，又用镇压器压了一次，最后用十行播种机播种。小苗刚出土时，长得齐刷茁壮；在铲头遍地时小苗有些发黄，到铲二遍时就转过来，随后就比用旧农具高作的庄稼强了。王永珍组一九五一年用苏联式马拉犁开了二十二垧榛柴荒地，又用圆盘耙耙了一次，其中有十五垧用播种机播了大豆。大豆长得有二尺七八寸高，每垧收了二千一百五十公斤，籽粒饱满，成熟期也比当地的大豆早六、七天。在收割时，组员赵俊向前往参观的老王头说：“你春天不是说榛柴荒地头一年种豆子不行吗？怎么又说豆长好啦？”老王头说：
    “唉！凭老一套是不行啦，还是新农具好啊！”
    3、节省劳动力，省工出活。吉林省榆树县何凤山互助组春耕时用旧农具种的地，马工占百分之五十六，人工占百分之四十四，用新农具种的地，马工占百分之七十四，人工占百分之二十六。夏锄时用旧农具操作是人忙马闲，改用新农具后，则变成人忙马也忙或马忙人不忙。吉林省磐石县孙海互助组从春耕至夏锄，用新农具每垧地需用人工畜工各十一个，用旧农具每垧地需用二十个人工和九个畜工，即用新农具种一垧地，比用旧农具节省九个人工，多用两个畜工；在春耕中使用新农具因着重深耕细耙，每垧地比用旧农具耕作多用一个人工，三个畜工，但在夏锄中则比用旧农具耕作节省十个人工和一个畜工，这就可以调剂夏锄时人工的不足。用旧农具是连翻带种，同时进行；用新农具可先把地耕好耙好，把劳力匀开，到播种时期，立即就能播种，缩短了播种时间。孙海组春耕用新农具比用旧农具时缩短了六天，夏锄时也比用旧农具时缩短了七天。其他几种新农具的工作效率，如播种机，两人四马一天能播种四垧地，比用旧农具节省十几个人工和马工；收割机割麦，八人四马一天收割五垧，比用镰刀收割，至少提高效率两三倍；打麦和脱谷机的效率，比旧农具提高效率三至五倍；综合号铲趟机也比旧农具的工作效率高一倍至一倍半，作到了多铲多趟。另外，使用新式农具，也有利于扩大耕地面积。如刘文彬互助组使用新农具，一九五一年扩大耕地面积百分之六十，每个劳动力平均负担耕地七垧一亩（当地每个劳力只负担三垧四亩）；王振堂互助组一九五零年使用成套苏联式马拉农具，共节省一千四百一十个工，开了九十七垧荒地；王治俭互助组用新农具一九五零年种地八十四垧，一九五一年扩大到一百六十五垧。
    使用新农具能增产的主要原因
    1、用旧农具耕种的土地，自秋季最后一次铲趟直到来年春耕，经过半年多的自然压力和雨雪的影响，地面已经坚硬，失去土壤的团粒构造。有些粘性土壤，在这样长时间内，土壤硬化，雨水不能渗漏下去，已失去保持水分的作用，不适宜作物的生长。土壤的团粒结构，就是土壤中由土粒结合而成的各种大小不同的土团。这种细粒土团，混杂着腐植质胶状体，使许多微气孔能保持养料和吸收水分，又能使“好气性细菌”得到繁殖的机会。这种细菌有分解有机质为无机质化合物以使作物吸收的作用。这些作用，必须使用新农具把土壤耕深、耙平、粉碎、疏松以后才能充分发挥。因为新农具有保持和形成土壤团粒结构的良好作用，可以增进地力，因此便提高了单位面积产量。这是使用新农具能够增产的主要原因之一。
    2、新农具耕得深、盖土严，能把杂草、草籽和植物的残骸，深深地埋在土里。这些东西经过腐沤，可以增加土地肥力。新农具又能把地下的害虫和卵蛹翻到地上，使它们经冰冻日晒而死亡。
    3、使用新农具的土地，作物播得较密，长得均匀，苗株对土地肥力可以充分利用，没有空白区，这样就可以增加产量。吉林省农业试验场进行行株距离的试验，证明用新农具适当密植比用旧农具实行大垅宽作的土地，产量提高百分之十七；吉林省和龙、怀德等八个县示范农场用新农具密植和用旧农具实行大垅宽作试验，也证明用新农具可增产百分之四十三。用新农具种的地，多系平作；而平作对土地的保持恒温和含蓄水分，都比高作的作用好。高垅有三面散发热和水分，不像平作散发面小。因此，高垅的地温在夜间低于平作；虽然在午间高垅地温高于平作，但晚间又形降下，昼夜间的地温变化甚大，不利于作物的生育。平作地温无过高过低的变化，在吸收水分、防止蒸发上也优于高作。今后应注意的几件事
    1、在过去试验和推广新农具时，曾遇到“思想保守”“不懂技术”两种障碍。针对这种情况，各级领导机关应抓紧典型，作好示范和推广站工作，组织农民去参观，使他们认识到用新农具生产的优越性。同时，应结合生产方向的教育，使农民认清使用新农具是为今后生产机械化、集体化准备基础。对于使用新农具的技术问题也要注意解决。因为新农具比旧农具构造复杂，农民不能很快地熟悉它。有的农民因为不会使用新农具，急得满头大汗；而村干部也不懂技术，只在旁边作政治动员，不但没有解决技术问题，反而引起农民的不满。因此，今后除用训练班形式对农民进行政治教育和技术训练外，还应使农村干部学会使用新农具的技术。这是推广新农具的很重要的一项工作。
    2、使用新农具要和巩固提高互助合作组织结合起来。新农具必须先贷给或卖给好的互助组和农业生产合作社。新农具发下后，就应着手帮助互助组调整组织。一九五一年凡是按照使用新农具的需要做了调整的互助组，新农具的效果就得到发挥，生产也显著提高，互助组也因而巩固和提高了。按照新农具的性能和今后逐步大量推广的方针，今后还应在互助组内有意识地教育农民，使他们在自愿的情况之下，把土地“连成片”，合作使用新农具。
    3、推广新农具必须和改进耕作法结合起来。新农具不仅能省工出活，更主要的是能深耕细作。但有的农民使用新农具，只满足于播种、收割效率快，能开荒、而忽视了在熟地上改进耕作法。今后推广新农具时，必须改进耕作法，贯彻提高单位面积产量的生产方针。
    4、新农具的制造方面要尽量合乎规格。新式农具是新的东西，我们缺乏制作它的经验，制造设备也简陋，甚至原料的规格有时也不一样，结果发生了不少困难。但是，我们必须把新式农具制造好，严防粗制滥造。只有制造出合乎规格的新农具，才能推广下去，才能达到提高产量、改善人民生活的目的。因此，制造合乎规格的新农具是每个公营农具工厂的严肃的政治任务。
