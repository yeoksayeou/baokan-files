　　Protest Against U.S. Aircraft Bombing the Yalu River Power Plant
　　——Reader's Letters Summary
　　The American aggressors' outrageous provocative act of continuously bombing the Yalu River power plant has aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the people. Readers of this newspaper have sent letters expressing their protest.
　　The entire staff of the Testing Division of the Ministry of Water Resources wrote: While peace-loving people around the world are celebrating the victorious completion of the Volga-Don Canal and the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, U.S. imperialism is carrying out the outrageous bombing of the Yalu River power plant. We, the water conservancy workers of New China, must not sit idly by and watch this lawless crime by the American aggressors. We must redouble our efforts to work for the water conservancy construction of our motherland, to strike at the American imperialists' destructive acts against the cause of peace.
　　The entire staff of the Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry wrote: From our work, we deeply feel how beautiful and great the construction of hydroelectric power plants is, and how significant it is to the peaceful life of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, we hate even more the U.S. imperialists' outrageous provocative acts of destroying the Shuifeng and other power plants. We—hydroelectric power workers of New China—will redouble our efforts to support the Korean and Chinese People's Forces standing at the forefront of defending world peace. We are willing to work with our Korean colleagues to restore and protect these peaceful and beautiful hydroelectric power plants in the Yalu River and other places.
　　The entire student body of Class 3, Grade 3, English Department of the Foreign Languages ​​School wrote: All these provocative acts by U.S. imperialism are in vain. What they cannot obtain on the battlefield and at the negotiating table cannot be obtained by any base and shameless means. The Chinese and Korean people, who have already stood up, will never be intimidated. On the contrary, they will strengthen their determination to fight to the end.
　　Should Care About Workers' Living Conditions
　　Comrade Editor: The administrative leaders of the Heshikuang site of the Sand and Soil Mining Company under the Enterprise Bureau of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government neglect the interests of workers; the workers' working and living conditions are very poor. The workers' dormitories are temporary tents made of canvas, with no windows and are especially dark inside. Workers sleep on piles of stones paved with stones, more than three inches above the ground. Some workers are covered with straw mats, and some workers only have straw mats covering the upper half of their bodies. Because the tents are particularly damp, the straw mats are moldy and covered with hair, and many workers have leg pain. In terms of diet, workers have no kitchen or canteen, and some units do not even have pot lids. When the wind blows, horse manure and dust from the roadside are blown into the pot. The mine is indifferent to injured workers. Some workers do not receive treatment for their injuries. Li Yongku, Huang Shengyuan, and other four workers in the second shift broke their hands while working and did not receive timely treatment. It was not until the wounds became inflamed and festered that they went to the hospital for treatment. Their injuries were too severe and they needed to be hospitalized, but they did not have the money to be hospitalized. Now, they have not worked for a month and a half, and their lives have become difficult. When the workers raised their opinions, the administrative负责人 of the mine refused to admit that it was a work-related injury and adopted an attitude of indifference. This is intolerable bureaucracy!
　　The workers have repeatedly reported to the administrative leaders of the mine, but they have not earnestly tried to solve the problem. This shows that the administrative leaders of the mine are indifferent to the workers' working and living conditions. I suggest that the administrative leaders of the company adopt an attitude of responsibility to the country and the people, urge the various sites to formulate effective and specific feasible improvement plans, and assign specific personnel to solve them within a set time limit.　Li Zhenjiang, Hebei Provincial Trust Company
　　Some Cadres Should Not Deceive Workers
　　Comrade Editor: On June 15, the Hebei Provincial Trust Company notified the Baoding City Transportation Company that it needed a group of workers to transport a batch of large barrels from the station to the company. Zhao Fuxing, the goods receiving officer of the company, went directly to the Loading and Unloading Team No. 1 and the Transportation Team No. 1 of the Transportation Company to find workers to transport the goods. When handling the shipping procedures, the team accountant Di Zhenming saw the words "soft green" and "hard green" written on the delivery note, and asked Zhao: "Is it poisonous?" Zhao replied: "It's stinky oil ointment, not poisonous." When the transport workers became suspicious of these items (because the handlers felt a burning sensation on their faces when handling them), they asked Zhao again: "What is this cargo? Is it poisonous?" Zhao always said: "This is stinky oil material, used for repairing roads, not poisonous! Don't worry! We won't deceive the workers."
　　The loading and unloading workers working at the company also became suspicious of these items and asked Li Hui, the warehouse manager of the company: "Is it poisonous?" Li also replied: "Not poisonous, but don't rub your eyes with your hands."
　　After the workers finished transporting all the goods, their faces burned and swelled; forty-six out of forty-nine workers were poisoned. Among them, Liu Zhigao and Wang Wenshou were the most severely poisoned, with respiratory suffocation. Fortunately, after first aid, they gradually improved.
　　After the accident, Xi Ruman, the chief of the personnel section of the Trust Company, and Fan Xiwen, a cadre of the storage and transportation section, came to the transportation company to discuss the incident. They still lied to the workers and said: "We didn't know it was poisonous either. The receiving officer Zhao Fuxing is also sick." In fact, Zhao Fuxing was not only not sick, but was also pointing fingers at the workers at the station, saying: "I already told you yesterday that it was poisonous, why didn't you prepare, and unfortunately such an incident occurred."
　　We believe that the Hebei Provincial Trust Company's serious error of disregarding the central government's laws, deceiving workers, and neglecting workers' lives is intolerable. In addition to bearing the medical expenses of the injured workers and wages during the recuperation period, the Hebei Provincial Trust Company should also conduct a public self-criticism and give appropriate punishment to the derelict personnel related to this matter to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

　　Failure to Value the Work of Clearing and Verifying Funds
　　Comrade Editor: I am a student at the Central Ministry of Communications Cadre School. According to the ministry's instructions, I went to the state-owned Beijing Automobile Repair Factory for a visit and stayed there for six days. When I arrived at the factory, it was precisely when the factory was engaged in the work of clearing and verifying funds. At the request of the factory, I helped them for three days. During these three days of work, I felt that the factory did not pay enough attention to the work of clearing and verifying funds. The general ledger of materials for September of last year has not yet been cleared, and there are many errors in the ledger. For example, a certain material is neither stagnant nor waste, but the figures on the ledger and the actual figures are very different; some even write new materials as old materials, and some write stagnant materials as waste materials (the estimated value varies). When we raised questions, some cadres were inexplicable; some arbitrarily altered them without detailed investigation. They believe that as long as the figures on the ledger are not contradictory. I hope that the leading comrades of the factory will correct this erroneous attitude towards the work of verifying funds.　Xu Ximing
　　Requesting Severe Punishment for Unlawful Capitalist Zhang Zunwen
　　Comrade Editor: Zhang Zunwen, manager of the Qingdao Private Jiandong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Zhang Yuting, deputy manager, disregarded worker safety, causing the death of worker Yan Shufen. The Qingdao Municipal People's Court sentenced Zhang Yuting to two years and six months of imprisonment according to the seriousness of the circumstances; and sentenced Zhang Zunwen to one year of imprisonment, suspended for two years. However, Zhang Zunwen is unwilling to accept the transformation and education that the people's government has given him, and instead uses various methods to threaten and deceive the workers. He first won over individual backward workers and instigated them to spread an atmosphere of dissatisfaction among the workers with the People's Court's punishment of Zhang Yuting. Then, Zhang Zunwen organized and planned a general staff meeting and called Yan Shufen's father. Zhang Zunwen said at the meeting: "Because of the lawsuit, business is bad, and it will cause more than thirty people to lose their jobs in the future. If you include the family members, more than one hundred people will have no food to eat," attempting to threaten the workers with these words. On June 13, he went to the deceased's home twice, before and after, and said to Yan Shufen's parents: "Now business is bad, there is no money to do business, I have no way. You should come forward and think of a way to release Zhang Yuting...." Under the threat and coercion of Zhang Zunwen, Yan Shufen's father made a request for the release of Zhang Yuting. Zhang Zunwen's arrogant slander of the people's government and public threats to the deceased's family members during the period of his being controlled are intolerable. We demand that the relevant leading authorities severely punish Zhang Zunwen.

　　Treat People's Letters With the Correct Attitude
　　Comrade Editor: Revolutionary soldier Wu Fenghao is from Minzhu Village, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu. After joining the People's Liberation Army in 1946, he lost contact with his family due to changes in the names of districts and townships. In December of last year, Xu Xinru, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section of the Qidong County People's Government, received a letter from Wu Fenghao's family. Xu Xinru thought: Revolutionary soldiers being able to contact their families and encourage each other can greatly promote the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea and production and construction. I must complete it as a political task. However, the address on the letter was not clearly written. Xu Xinru wrote letters to the people's governments of various districts to inquire and talked with people, asking them to help investigate Wu Fenghao's family. After inquiring from all aspects for two months, he could not find them. Xu Xinru wrote another letter to Wu Fenghao, hoping that he would write the address of his family in more detail. But after Wu Fenghao's reply came, he still could not find his family address. Xu Xinru posted an announcement on the Qidong County Cultural Center's blackboard newspaper, but still no news. Some comrades in the Civil Affairs Section "advised" him not to "bother" anymore. But Xu Xinru realized that seriously handling letters from revolutionary soldiers is one of the specific tasks of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to their families. He did not lose confidence and continued to find ways to inquire. Finally, on May 28 of this year, Xu Xinru finally found the address of Wu Fenghao's family. Ni Jingfu, a member of Wu Fenghao's family, said gratefully after receiving the letter: "You are so responsible that we can communicate with relatives who have been separated for several years. We must write to Fenghao and ask him to work with peace of mind."
　　Xu Xinru's action of seriously handling this matter corrected the sloppy attitude of the comrades in the Civil Affairs Section of the Qidong County People's Government towards letters from revolutionary soldiers and letters from the people in the past, and made them realize that as long as they are truly responsible, they can definitely solve the problem satisfactorily.　Li Kangzu

    抗议美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂
    ——读者来信综述
    美国侵略者连续轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的疯狂挑衅行为，引起广大人民的愤慨。本报读者纷纷来信表示抗议。
    中央水利部测验司全体工作人员来信说：全世界爱好和平的人民正在庆祝伏尔加—顿运河和荆江分洪工程胜利完工的时候，美帝国主义却对鸭绿江发电厂施行了疯狂的轰炸。我们新中国的水利工作者，绝不能坐视美国侵略者这种无法无天的罪行。我们要加倍努力，为祖国的水利建设而工作，以打击美帝国主义对和平事业的破坏行为。
    中央燃料工业部水力发电工程局全体工作人员来信说：从我们的工作中，我们深切地体会到水力发电厂是多么美丽、多么伟大的工程建设，在广大人民的和平生活中有着多么重大的意义；因此；我们更加痛恨美帝国主义破坏水丰等发电厂的疯狂挑衅行为。我们——新中国的水力发电工作者，将以加倍的努力来支援站在保卫世界和平最前线的朝中人民部队；我们愿意和我们的朝鲜同业们一起来恢复和保卫这些在鸭绿江等地的和平、美丽的水力发电厂。
    外国语学校英文系三级三班全体学生来信说：美帝国主义这一切挑衅行为都是枉然的，他们在战场上和谈判桌上所得不到的东西，是用任何卑鄙无耻的手段也得不到的。已经站起来了的中朝人民永远不会被吓倒，相反地，更会加强斗争到底的决心。
    应该关心工人的生活条件
    编辑同志：沈阳市人民政府企业局所属砂土矿公司河石矿现场的行政领导方面，忽视工人的利益；工人的劳动条件和生活条件十分恶劣。工人的宿舍是用帆布搭成的临时帐棚，没有窗户，里边特别黑。工人睡在用石头铺成的、离地三寸多高的石堆上。有的工人铺着草垫子，有的工人只上半身铺着草垫子。因为帐棚里特别潮湿，草垫子都发了霉，长了毛，很多工人腿疼。在饮食方面，工人没有厨房和食堂，有的单位连锅盖也没有。刮风的时候，道旁的马粪和尘土都刮到锅里去了。该矿对受伤的工人漠不关心。有的工人受了伤得不到治疗。二班李永库、黄生元等四人，工作时把手磨破了，没有及时治疗，直到伤口发炎溃烂，才到医院去治疗。他们伤势过重，需要住院，但又没有钱住院。现在，他们已经一个半月没有工作，生活发生了困难。工人提出意见，该矿行政负责人还不承认是工伤，采取不管不理的态度，这是令人难以容忍的官僚主义！
    工人曾数次向该矿行政领导方面反映，但他们不认真地设法解决问题。这说明该矿行政领导方面对工人的劳动条件和生活条件是漠不关心的。我建议该公司行政领导方面采取对国家对人民负责的态度，督促各现场制订有效的、具体可行的改进计划，指定专人，限定日期加以解决。　李振江河北省信托公司
    某些干部不该欺骗工人
    编辑同志：六月十五日，河北省信托公司通知保定市搬运公司，要一部分工人由车站给该公司搬运一批大桶。该公司领货员赵福兴直接到搬运公司装卸一中队和运输一中队，找工人去搬运货物。在办理运货手续时，该队会计邸箴明见提货单上写着“软青”、“硬青”字样，就问赵：“是否有毒？”赵答：“是臭油膏，没毒。”当运输工人对这些物品发生怀疑时（因搬运工人在搬运时感到脸上发烧），曾再次问赵：“这是什么货物？是不是毒品？”赵始终说：“这是臭油料子，修马路用的，没有毒！你们放心吧！我们是不会欺骗工人的。”
    在该公司工作的装卸工人，也对这些物品发生怀疑，问该公司管库员李辉：“是不是有毒？”而李亦答：“没毒，但不要用手擦眼。”
    工人把全部货物搬运完毕，脸上发烧、发肿；四十九个工人有四十六个人中毒。其中刘志高、王文寿二人中毒最深，呼吸窒塞，幸亏经过急救，才逐渐好转。
    事故发生后，信托公司人事科科长郗汝满、储运科干部范西文到搬运公司来谈这一事件的经过。他们仍然欺骗工人说：“我们也不知道有毒，领货员赵福兴也病了。”实际上赵福兴不但没病，而且正在车站上指责工人说：“昨天我已经对你们讲过是毒品，你们为什么不准备，不幸竟发生了这样的事件。”
    我们认为河北省信托公司这种置中央法令于不顾，欺骗工人，忽视工人生命的严重错误行为，是不能容忍的。河北省信托公司除应负担受伤工人的医药费及疗养期间的工资外，并应进行公开的检讨，给和这事有关的失职人员以适当处分，防止类似事件的再度发生。

    不重视清查核定资金工作
    编辑同志：我是中央交通部干部学校的学员，按照部里的指示，到国营北京汽车修理厂去参观，在那里住了六天。我到该厂时，正值该厂搞清查核定资金工作，由于厂方的要求，我曾帮助他们搞了三天。在这三天的工作中，我觉得该厂对清查核定资金工作是不够重视的。他们去年九月份的材料总账到现在还没有清理出来，而且账上错误很多。例如某种材料既不是呆料，也不是废料，但账面上的数字和实有数字却相差很大；有的竟把新料写成旧料，有的把呆料写成废料（估价有高低）。我们提出疑问时，有些干部莫名其妙；有的不经过详细调查，就擅自涂改。他们认为只要账面数字没有矛盾就行了。我希望该厂领导同志纠正对核定资金工作上的这种错误态度。　徐夕明
    要求严惩不法资本家张尊文
    编辑同志：青岛私营建东染织厂经理张尊文、副经理张虞庭，漠视工人安全，造成工人?淑芬死亡事件。青岛市人民法院按情节轻重，判处张虞庭有期徒刑二年六个月；判处张尊文有期徒刑一年，缓期二年。但是，张尊文对人民政府对他的改造和教育不愿接受，反用各种方法向工人进行威胁、欺骗。他首先拉拢了个别落后工人，唆使他们在工人中散播不满人民法院对张虞庭处分的空气。接着，张尊文便有组织、有计划地布置了一次全体职工会议，并把?淑芬的父亲叫来。张尊文在会上说：“因为打官司，营业不好，将来会造成三十多人的失业，如果连眷属算上，将有一百多人没有饭吃了”，企图拿这些话威胁工人。六月十三日，他又前后两次到死者家中去，向?淑芬的父母说：“现在营业不好，作买卖没有钱，我没有办法了。你快出头想想办法吧，把张虞庭释放……。”死者?淑芬的父亲在张尊文的威胁和逼迫下，就提出了要求释放张虞庭的请求书。张尊文在被管制时期，竟如此狂妄地毁谤人民政府，公开威胁死者家属，是令人不能容忍的事。我们要求有关领导机关严办张尊文。

    用正确态度对待人民来信
    编辑同志：革命军人吴凤高是苏北启东县民主村人。他在一九四六年参加解放军以后，因为区乡名称的变更，和家庭失去了联系。去年十二月，启东县人民政府民政科科员徐心如接到吴凤高的家信一封。徐心如想：革命军人能和家庭联系，相互鼓励，对抗美援朝、生产建设能起很大的推动作用，我一定要当作政治任务来完成它。但是，那封信上的地址写得不清楚。徐心如便写信到各区人民政府去询问，并找人谈话，要求他们帮助调查吴凤高的家庭。向各方面查了两个月都查不到。徐心如又写信给吴凤高，希望他把家庭的住址写得详细些。但吴凤高的回信来了以后，仍然查不到他的家庭住址。徐心如在启东县文化馆的黑板报上登了启事，还是没有音讯。民政科有的同志“劝”他不要再“麻烦”了。但徐心如认识到认真处理革命军人的信件，是拥军优属的具体工作之一，他没有失掉信心，仍然继续想法查询。直到今年五月二十八日，徐心如终于查到吴凤高家庭的住址。吴凤高的家属倪静夫拿到信以后，很感激地说：“你们这样负责，使我们和断绝了几年的亲人又通音讯了。我们一定要写信给凤高，要他安心工作。”
    徐心如认真处理这件事的行动，纠正了启东县人民政府民政科同志们过去对待革命军人信件和人民来信的马虎态度，使他们认识到只要切实负责，一定可以圆满地解决问题。　李康佐
