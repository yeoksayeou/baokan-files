Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the same day (July 4th) that the Yoshida reactionary group forcibly passed the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" in the Diet, calling on the Japanese people to launch a struggle to declare the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" invalid.

The statement said: The establishment of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" means that the entire Japanese people have become prisoners of US imperialism. Because the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" is a product of the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the "Security Treaty," it is an American-style national suppression law agreed upon by the US and Japanese reactionaries when concluding the "Administrative Agreement." The commander who brazenly disregarded the opposition of the Japanese people and forcibly passed this bill was the de facto American Governor of Japan, US Ambassador Murphy. The "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" is only a part of Murphy's policy of turning the Japanese people into slaves of US imperialism. Therefore, the Yoshida government and the Liberal Party are not simply conservative and reactionary parties, but traitorous governments and traitorous political parties that sell out the people.

The statement continued: The consequence of implementing the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" will be dragging the Japanese people into war. This is why the "Police Reserve Force" is increasing its personnel, equipped with airplanes, tanks, heavy artillery, and rocket launchers, and conducting training, with destroyers leased by the United States, and the "Maritime Safety Agency" is massively increasing its personnel, and for this purpose, resident registration is being implemented to prepare for conscription. Implementing the above work is Murphy's task; assisting in the implementation of the above task is the work of Japanese traitors.

The statement pointed out: The disaster of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" to the Japanese people will be indescribable, and a large number of outstanding Japanese people will suffer cruel persecution. Not only that, but the roots of democracy will also wither, and freedom and creation will surely die.

The statement emphasized: Nevertheless, the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" cannot suppress the will of the Japanese people to demand independence and peace. The Japanese people are people who love independence, freedom, and peace. They are risking their lives and shedding their blood to demand independence and peace. The "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," which attempts to suppress this demand, will be in vain no matter what violence it uses as a backing to suppress the people. There is no cowardly blood in the blood of the Japanese people who are willing to be American slaves and prisoners.

The statement called on the Japanese people: Now is the time to stand up and fight for patriotism and peace. Now is the time to smash the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." All the research rooms of the Faculty of Economics of Tokyo University have almost all been mobilized, and they have called on the entire school to fight for the realization of the "Declaration of Invalidity of the Subversive Activities Prevention Act." The National Federation of Student Autonomy Associations, a nationwide student group, unanimously passed the "Declaration of Invalidity of the Subversive Activities Prevention Act" at its national conference on June 28. Trade unions in various places have also responded to this call and have successively fought for the "Declaration of Invalidity of the Subversive Activities Prevention Act." Now is the time for students and workers to fight together, to expand this force to farmers and citizens, and to advance towards the front of organizing all the people who are patriotic and uphold peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Tokyo Dispatch: The "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," which has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people, came into effect on the 21st, and the special agency "Public Security Investigation Agency" that implements this reactionary law was also established on the same day. This is a major measure by the US and Japanese reactionaries to further push Japan towards the path of fascism.

Kyodo News Agency said bluntly when talking about the entry into force of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act": This law replaces some occupation regulations and will be "used as an omnipotent law for 'suppressing the communists'." Not only that, but the Associated Press admitted: "Many people believe that the law's broad discretionary powers make it too easy for the government to suppress legitimate trade union activities." Undoubtedly, this fascist law will be widely used to deal with progressive organizations and mass organizations. The fascist Fujii Goichiro, who once served as the Vice Minister of Justice of the puppet "Mongolian United Autonomous Government" and a judge of the Japanese Supreme Court, has been appointed as the Director-General of the "Public Security Investigation Agency." Kyodo News Agency revealed that the agency will first target progressive newspapers and periodicals such as "Akahata" and progressive groups as targets of suppression when actively carrying out its activities.

The entry into force of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" can only arouse stronger opposition from the Japanese people. The Associated Press said in a dispatch from Tokyo on the eve of the entry into force of this law (20th): It will "take effect amid serious public anxiety." Japanese newspapers are "almost unanimous" in their concern that this law will infringe on "legitimate civil liberties."

The Japanese working class, which has launched a vigorous strike struggle against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," will continue to resolutely fight for the abolition of this fascist law. At the National Congress on the 20th, the National Railway Workers' Union, which has nearly 400,000 members, decided to demand the abolition of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." The conference also called for opening up trade between Japan and China and opposing the re-militarization of Japan.

### 日共中央指导部号召日本人民展开斗争  粉碎吉田政府“防止破坏活动法”

    日共中央指导部号召日本人民展开斗争
    粉碎吉田政府“防止破坏活动法”
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部在吉田反动集团强制国会通过“防止破坏活动法”的当天（七月四日）发表文告，号召日本人民展开宣布“防止破坏活动法”无效的斗争。
    文告说：“防止破坏活动法”的成立，对日本人民意味着日本人民整个成了美帝国主义的囚犯。因为“防止破坏活动法”是旧金山和约和“安全条约”的产物，是缔结“行政协定”时美、日反动派约定要制订的美制国民镇压法。横蛮地不顾日本人民的反对而强行通过这个法案的指挥者是事实上的美国驻日本总督、美国大使墨菲。“防止破坏活动法”不过是变日本人民为美帝国主义的奴隶的墨菲方针的一环而已。因此，吉田政府和自由党不是单纯的保守反动党派，而是出卖国民的卖国政府、卖国政党。
    文告接着说：实施“防止破坏活动法”的后果将是将日本国民拖向战争。这就是“警察后备队”增加人员、配备以飞机、坦克、重炮、火箭炮并进行训练，由美国租给驱逐舰，“海上保安队”大规模增加人员，并为此实行居民登记，准备征兵。实现上述工作是墨菲的任务；辅助实现上述任务是日本卖国贼的工作。
    文告指出：“防止破坏活动法”对日本人民的灾害将是无可形容的，大批的优秀的日本人民将遭受到残酷的迫害。不仅如此，民主主义的根也将干枯，自由和创造必将死灭。
    文告强调说：尽管如此，“防止破坏活动法”是不能镇压日本人民要求独立与和平的意志的。日本人民是爱好独立、自由、和平的人民。他们是拚性命、洒热血来要求独立与和平。企图压制这种要求的“防止破坏活动法”不论以什么暴力作后盾来压制人民，也是徒然。日本人民的血液中没有甘心充当美国奴隶和囚犯的卑怯者的血。
    文告号召日本人民说：现在是站起来作爱国和拥护和平的斗争的时候了。现在是粉碎“防止破坏活动法”的时候了。东京大学经济学院所有的研究室几乎全都已经动起来，并号召全校为实现关于“防止破坏活动法无效的宣言”而斗争。全国学生的团体全国学生自治会联合会于六月二十八日的全国大会上全体一致通过了关于“防止破坏活动法无效的宣言”。各地工会也响应这个号召，相继为关于“防止破坏活动法无效的宣言”而斗争。现在是学生和工人一致奋斗的时候，是把这个力量扩张到农民、市民中间，向组织爱国与拥护和平的全体国民的战线前进的时候了。
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：遭到日本人民强烈反对的“防止破坏活动法”已从二十一日起开始生效，执行这个反动法律的特务机构“公安调查厅”也在同日成立。这是美、日反动派将日本更向法西斯道路推进一步的重大措施。
    共同社在谈到“防止破坏活动法”生效的时候露骨地说：这个法律是代替一些占领法规的，将被“作为‘剿共’的万能法而使用”。不仅如此，合众社承认：“许多人认为：该法律广泛的任意处置之权，使政府太容易压制合法的工会活动”。无可置疑地，这个法西斯法律是要广泛地用来对付进步组织和群众团体的。曾任伪“蒙古联合自治政府”司法部次长和日本最高法院法官的法西斯分子藤井五一郎已被任命为“公安调查厅”长官。共同社透露，该厅在积极展开活动时将首先以“赤旗报”等进步报刊和进步团体为镇压对象。
    “防止破坏活动法”的生效只能引起日本人民的更强烈的反对。合众社在这个法律生效的前夕（二十日）发自东京的电讯说：它将“在公众严重不安的情绪下生效”。日本的报纸“几乎一致”担忧这个法律将侵犯“合法的公民自由”。
    曾经为反对“防止破坏活动法”而展开轰轰烈烈的罢工斗争的日本工人阶级，将继续为废除这个法西斯法律而坚决斗争。拥有会员将近四十万人的国营铁道工会，在二十日的全国代表大会上决定要求废除“防止破坏活动法”。大会并要求开放日本和中国的贸易，反对日本重新军国主义化。
