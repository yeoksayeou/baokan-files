Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 2nd. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the significance of the successful full opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, saying: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is one of the great construction projects of New China. It was completed within two years using Chinese people's own materials and labor, which greatly enhanced the Chinese people's sense of national pride. Everyone will be proud of this.

Sichuan is very rich in resources, but due to inconvenient transportation, people's economic and cultural exchanges have been hindered. As early as the Manchu Qing Dynasty in the early 20th century, the people of Sichuan hoped to build a modern railway in the province, and in 1911, they even waged a bloody struggle for it, which became the fuse of the Xinhai Revolution. However, after the rule of traitorous governments such as Yuan Shikai, the Northern Warlords, and Chiang Kai-shek, this hope of the Sichuan people was never realized. More than forty years passed, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway remained a dotted line on the map. It was not until the victory of the Chinese Revolution and the establishment of the People's Government, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, that the dream of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway became a reality. The People's Government only took two years to completely realize the hopes of the Sichuan people for more than forty years.

The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway entirely used domestic materials, which is a very significant thing. This fact shattered the fallacies of the imperialist elements and also corrected the erroneous understanding of some Chinese engineering and technical personnel with bourgeois ideas. These people believed that China could not build a railway that met world standards on its own; their basis was that in Chinese history, no railway had been built successfully without borrowing from imperialists and purchasing materials from imperialists by piecing things together. However, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway once again proves that this statement is completely a fallacy. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese people have immeasurable creative power.

In building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the People's Government truly achieved "local sourcing of materials." Except for a portion of the steel rail raw materials that came from Northeast China and other places, the other materials for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were basically taken from Sichuan Province, especially from the area along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This shows that our country has abundant resources and further strengthens our confidence in building the motherland.

In leading the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the People's Government fully relied on the masses, organizing the forces of workers, peasants, soldiers, and other aspects into the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, truly achieving "wisdom and effort from all." The People's Government successfully used military workers as pioneers and quickly organized more than 100,000 scattered and unorganized farmers, highly leveraging their labor enthusiasm and creating a miracle of high labor efficiency. The People's Government fully utilized the enthusiasm of the local people's governments, local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party, and mass organizations along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to serve the construction of the motherland, enabling them to demonstrate a great organizational role in the construction. The People's Government also successfully organized railway bureaus across the country and related parties to provide material and human support to the young Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Among the staff of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, besides those from Hainan Island, there were cadres from railway administrations all over the country, who worked together as one.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is also a great crystallization of the combination of the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction and the wisdom and labor of the Chinese working people. Soviet bridge experts, design experts, and line experts used advanced Soviet construction experience to help our country plan and transform the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, making the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction solid, progress rapid, and saving a lot of funds. In terms of engineering, the assistance of Soviet experts played a decisive role in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This point provided a practical education for those in China's engineering and technical circles with bourgeois ideas. The completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has greatly strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway connects the two major cities of Chongqing and Chengdu, and its route runs through the rich Sichuan Basin. Its far-reaching role in promoting urban and rural economy and developing culture will become increasingly apparent after its opening. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a road leading the people of Sichuan to a happy life. The rapid completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a testament to the Chinese people's efforts to engage in peaceful labor against wars of aggression.

The Chinese Communist Party is the organizer and inspirer of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The working people of the Southwest generally regard the victory of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as a great victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and as a great victory of communist thought. The prestige of the Chinese Communist Party among the people is now rapidly increasing, and letters of gratitude and praise to Chairman Mao Zedong are flying to the editorial offices of newspapers everywhere like snowflakes. However, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is only a beginning. In the upcoming upsurge of large-scale economic construction across the country, the People's Government will follow the valuable experience provided by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to build railways in all directions in the mountainous southwest of the motherland, permanently eliminate the sigh of "the road to Shu is difficult," connect cities and villages, and further improve the people's economic and cultural life.

    新华社记者评成渝铁路全线通车的意义
    【新华社重庆二日电】新华社记者评论成渝铁路全线通车的胜利意义说：成渝铁路是新中国巨大建设工程之一，它在两年之内以中国人民自己的资材和自己的劳动修建完成，它大大提高了中国人民的民族自豪感。每一个人都将为此感到骄傲。
    四川的物产非常丰富，但因交通不便，人民的经济交流和文化交流受到阻隔。四川人民早在二十世纪初的满清统治时期，就曾希望在本省修建一条近代化的铁路，并曾在一九一一年为此进行过流血的斗争，这个斗争成了辛亥革命的导火线。但是以后经过袁世凯、北洋军阀和蒋介石等等卖国政府统治，四川人民的这一希望一直不曾实现。四十多年过去了，成渝铁路在地图上始终是一条虚线。一直到中国革命胜利，人民政府成立，在毛主席英明领导之下，修筑成渝铁路的梦想才变成了事实。人民政府只用了二年的时间就完全实现了四川人民四十多年来的希望。
    成渝铁路的修建全部采用本国器材，这是一件极有意义的事情。这一事实打破了帝国主义分子的邪说，也纠正了一些具有资产阶级思想的中国工程技术人员的错误认识，这些人都认为中国不可能自力修筑一条合乎世界规格的铁路；他们的根据是中国历史上没有一条铁路不是向帝国主义借款并向帝国主义购买材料才勉强东拼西凑建筑成功的。但是成渝铁路的筑成再次证明：这种说法完全是邪说。在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，中国人民具有无法估量的创造力量。
    在建筑成渝铁路中，人民政府真正做到了“就地取材”。除一部分钢轨原料是来自东北等地外，成渝铁路的其他材料基本上取自四川本地，特别是取之成渝铁路沿线一带。这说明了我国是有丰富的资源，更加坚定了我们建设祖国的自信心。
    人民政府在领导修筑成渝铁路中，充分依靠群众，把工、农、兵和其他各方面的力量都组织到成渝铁路的建设中来，真正做到“群策群力”。人民政府成功地使用了军工担任开路先锋，并把十多万散漫无组织的农民迅速组织起来，高度发挥了他们的劳动热忱，创造了高度劳动效率的奇迹。人民政府充分运用了成渝铁路沿线的地方人民政府、中国共产党的地方组织和群众团体的为祖国建设服务的积极性，使他们在筑路中表现了极大的组织作用。人民政府并且成功地组织了全国各铁路局和各有关方面，对年轻的成渝铁路给予物力和人力的支援。在成渝铁路工作人员中，除了海南岛以外，有着从全国各铁路管理局派来的干部，他们在工作中团结得像一个人一样。
    成渝铁路也是苏联社会主义建设的先进经验和中国劳动人民的智慧劳动相结合的伟大结晶。苏联的桥梁专家、设计专家和线路专家运用苏联先进的建设经验，帮助我国规划和改造了成渝铁路的工程，使成渝铁路修筑坚固、进展迅速，而且节约了大量资金。在工程上说，苏联专家的帮助对成渝铁路具有决定性的作用。这一点使我国那些具有资产阶级思想的工程技术界受到了切实的教育。成渝铁路的建成大大密切了中苏两国人民的友谊。
    成渝铁路把重庆——成都两大城市连接起来，而它的沿线又是富庶的四川盆地，它的繁荣城乡经济和发展文化的深远作用在通车后将日益显现出来。成渝铁路是导致四川人民通往幸福生活的道路。成渝铁路的迅速建成是中国人民反对侵略战争努力从事和平劳动的明证。
    中国共产党是修建成渝铁路的组织者和鼓舞者。西南的劳动人民群众普遍把建设成渝铁路的胜利看作中国共产党领导的伟大胜利，看作共产主义思想的伟大胜利。中国共产党在人民群众中的威望现在急剧地增长，感激和歌颂毛泽东主席的信件有如雪片一般飞到各地报纸的编辑部中。但是成渝铁路的建设不过是一个开端而已，在即将到来的全国大规模经济建设高潮中，人民政府将按照成渝铁路提供的可贵经验，在祖国的多山的西南建设四通八达的铁路，永远消除“蜀道难”的感叹，把城市和乡村连接起来，把人民的经济生活和文化生活进一步提高。
