Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: According to a German Press Agency report from Bonn on the 16th: Two European journalists who recently arrived in Bonn from Brussels revealed that General Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth Army of the U.S. forces invading Korea, admitted to Mr. Schellekens, head of the Belgian mission in Tokyo, that the U.S. military used bacteriological weapons in Korea and on Chinese territory. This was mentioned by Mr. Schellekens in a letter to the Belgian Foreign Minister on March 5. The two journalists, who requested anonymity, knew the contents of the letter and revealed excerpts from it.
	Schellekens said in the letter:
	"On March 2nd, I had a conversation with General Van Fleet, who came to Tokyo. When I asked about the North Koreans and Chinese allegations of American planes dropping bacteria over North Korean and Chinese territory, General Van Fleet replied: 'It is not surprising that the American army uses mass murder methods that have not been used before in order to achieve victory.'"
	Van Fleet also admitted to Schellekens the conspiracy of the United States to delay the armistice negotiations with the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation." Schellekens said in the letter: "General Van Fleet told me privately that the U.S. government is delaying the armistice negotiations in order to buy time to create a 'situation full of strength' and will insist on their demand for 'voluntary' repatriation of prisoners of war." Schellekens said: "According to Van Fleet, the purpose of the Allied forces in Korea now is to gain military advantage on the front lines." People remember that Acheson and Ridgway desperately denied that the U.S. military was conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and while setting traps on the road to Korean armistice negotiations, they shamelessly shirked their responsibility for delaying the negotiations. Now, their subordinates, the direct commanders of the U.S. invading forces, have personally admitted to the ironclad fact that the U.S. invading forces were conducting germ warfare in Korea on the one hand, and delaying the Korean armistice negotiations under the guise of so-called "voluntary repatriation" on the other. Just as General Colson admitted the crime of the U.S. side's massacre of prisoners of war, the American generals so unscrupulously admitted their own criminal acts, which Acheson and his ilk can never deny.

    在回答比利时驻东京使团团长的问题时
    范佛里特承认进行细菌战并蓄意拖延谈判
    【新华社十九日讯】据德意志通讯社波恩十六日讯：两个最近由布鲁塞尔抵达波恩的欧洲籍记者透露：侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特曾向比利时驻东京使团团长薛佛勒里承认美军在朝鲜和中国领土上使用细菌武器。这是薛佛勒里在三月五日写给比利时外交大臣的一封信中谈到的。这两个要求不要发表姓名的记者知道这封信的内容，并透露了该信的摘录。
    薛佛勒里在这封信中说：
    “三月二日，我和来到东京的范佛里特将军谈过一次话。在我问到北朝鲜人和中国人所说的美国飞机在北朝鲜和中国领土上投掷细菌一事的时候，范佛里特将军回答道：‘美国军队为了获得胜利而使用以前没有使用过的大规模杀人手段，并不是什么令人惊奇的事。’”
    范佛里特还向薛佛勒里承认了美国用所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则拖延停战谈判的阴谋。薛佛勒里在信中说：“范佛里特将军私下告诉我：美国政府正在拖延停战谈判，以便争取时间来造成一个‘充满力量的形势’，并将坚持他们的‘自愿’遣返战俘的要求。”薛佛勒里说：“按照范佛里特的话来看，朝鲜境内联军的目的现在是要在前线获得军事优势。”人们记得艾奇逊和李奇微曾经拚命抵赖美军在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战，他们并一面在朝鲜停战谈判的道路上遍设陷阱，一面无耻地推卸他们拖延谈判的责任。现在，他们的下属，美国侵朝军队的直接指挥者已经亲口承认了美国侵略军在朝鲜一面进行细菌战，一面假借所谓“自愿遣返”来拖延朝鲜停战谈判的铁的事实。正如柯尔生将军承认美方屠杀战俘的罪行一样，美国的将军们是这样肆无忌惮地承认了他们自己的犯罪行为，这是艾奇逊之流永远也不能否认的。
