Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 28th: On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, many famous combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army wrote letters to heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, national model workers, and families of famous revolutionary martyrs, reporting their determination to study culture to strengthen national defense construction. They expressed their willingness to advance shoulder to shoulder with heroes and model workers who have achieved brilliant results on various fronts such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and economic construction, and to work together to defend and build the motherland.

    Tian Guangwen, the famous combat hero who created the nationally renowned "White Tiger Company," said in his letter to Guo Zhongtian, a famous combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers: "Your heroic deeds and noble patriotism and internationalism are constantly inspiring us to move forward. I am responding to the call of the Party and higher authorities and am currently engaged in formal cultural studies. There are many difficulties at the beginning of learning. However, when I think of the brutal acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism, the production and construction and happy life of our motherland, and especially the arduous battles you fought on the Korean front, I am immediately filled with the determination and confidence to overcome difficulties. I deeply understand that to defend our beloved motherland, we must learn culture well, master modern military science and technology, and build a strong national defense force. I must learn from your revolutionary heroism in overcoming difficulties on the battlefield and win a great victory on the cultural learning front!"

    Guo Junqing, the famous female combat hero, said in her letter to Hao Jianxiu, the nationally famous industrial labor model: "Under the cultivation of the Party, you actively studied and created the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, which promoted the movement to increase production and practice economy, directly enhancing the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Your contribution to the motherland is great and worthy of our learning. I used to be a poor child, but under the cultivation of the Party, I have received high honors. This June, the Party transferred me to a cultural school to study. In the past twenty-odd days, I have learned more than 2,300 characters and can write general articles. In order to defend the motherland, I will definitely study harder and be a modern national defense army soldier. At the same time, I also hope that you will continue to work diligently and actively on the economic front, use your brains, and strive to create more new records!"

    The famous Tashan hero Bao Renchuan, the lone dare hero Mao Guo, and the crossing-the-sea hero Li Shuting also wrote letters to Dong Quanzhong, the father of the famous people's hero Dong Cunrui, Luo Diekai, the father of the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, and Qu Yaoli, the famous national cotton planting model. Bao Renchuan said in his letter to Dong Quanzhong: "Although Comrade Dong Cunrui gloriously sacrificed himself for the people and the motherland, thousands upon thousands of heroes and model workers have emerged behind him, advancing heroically under the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong! We hope that you will also actively respond to Chairman Mao's call on the agricultural production front, vigorously launch drought prevention and resistance work, improve seeds and farming methods, produce more grain, practice strict economy, and increase more wealth for the country, so that the motherland can achieve victory simultaneously on the economic construction front and the national defense construction front!"
