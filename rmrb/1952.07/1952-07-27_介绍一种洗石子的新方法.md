    Introducing a New Method for Washing Stones
    To the Editor: Wang Yaowu of the Fourth Engineering Team of the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Department Engineering Company, in the course of the production increase and economy campaign, actively sought out ingenious methods and improved the method of washing stones, increasing production efficiency by more than threefold and greatly improving the quality of the project. In the past, this engineering team washed stones by digging a pool, filling it with water, and having two people lift a basket of stones and squat in the pool to wash them. Each worker could only wash an average of 0.6 cubic meters of stones per day. Now, the method for washing stones involves digging a pool that is two steps wide and three steps long, with thin strips of wood (like a steamer, but with holes small enough so the stones won't fall through) placed halfway up the sides. The stones are moved from one side to the other, and the mud on the stones falls through the strips. This way, stones can be poured into the pool on one side and scooped out on the other, saving both effort and time. Now, each worker can wash an average of approximately 3.8 cubic meters per day, increasing work efficiency by more than threefold compared to the original method.

    介绍一种洗石子的新方法
    编辑同志：山西省工业厅工程公司第四工程队王耀武，在增产节约运动中，积极找窍门，改进了洗石子的方法，使生产效率提高三倍多，并大大提高了工程质量。过去这个工程队洗石子是挖上一个池子，池子里边放上水，两个人抬上一筐石子在水池里蹲一蹲，每天每工平均只能洗○点六方石子。现在洗石子是挖一个两步宽三步长的池子，池子半腰放上些细条板子（像蒸笼似的漏不下石子去），把石子从那边扒到这边，石子上的泥土都漏下去了，石子却漏不下去。这样，一边往池内倒石子，一边往出捞石子，又省力又快，现在每天每工平均约洗三点八方，较原来工作效率提高三倍多。
