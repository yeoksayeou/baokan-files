Xinhua News Agency, July 17th, Bonn Dispatch: After two days of discussion, the West German Federal Parliament, against the will of the German people, passed the first reading of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" Treaty on July 10. During the discussion, West German "Chancellor" Adenauer vigorously urged the parliament to quickly approve these treaties. Now, these two treaties have been handed over to seven committees of the Bonn Parliament for "study." According to a Reuters dispatch from Bonn on July 10, "The second and third readings, at which important votes will be taken, are expected to take place in September or October."

During the discussion in the Bonn Parliament, the right-wing Social Democratic Party members of Schumacher once again exposed themselves as traitors to the German people. Their representatives made sensational speeches in the Bonn Parliament, verbally expressing opposition to the "General Treaty," but when it came to voting, all the Social Democratic Party members voted in favor of these treaties along with the ruling party members of the Adenauer government. In order to appease the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of West German people, especially the lower-level members of the Social Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group proposed in the parliament that the four occupying powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, should hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the issue of restoring German unification. This proposal was unanimously passed because none of the ruling party members dared to vote against it.

In the Bonn Parliament, the only members who voted against the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" Treaty were the members of the German Communist Party. The Chairman of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, delivered a lengthy speech in the parliament, exposing the essence of these two enslaving treaties. He pointed out that signing the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" Treaty is an act of treason, and the members of the Federal Parliament should refuse to ratify these treaties. The "General Treaty" deepens the division of Germany, hinders the four powers from reaching an agreement and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, deprives the German people of their sovereignty, continues to subject West Germany to foreign imperialist occupation and enslavement, turns West Germany into a foreign military base and battlefield, and drives the West German people to become cannon fodder for the "European Army." Lehmann said that there is only one path before the German people that can guarantee their survival as an independent nation, and that path is the peaceful restoration of German unification, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. It is practically possible to take this path, because the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany is based on guaranteeing the restoration of German sovereignty and guaranteeing that Germany becomes a unified and independent country. Lehmann called on the West German people to take active action to oppose the ratification and implementation of the "General Treaty," force the Adenauer traitorous government to resign, and strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

Outside the Bonn Parliament, the attitude of the West German people towards the various right-wing parties is very clear. Just as the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" Treaty were being passed, posters like these were plastered all over the streets of Bonn: "The General Treaty is completely a treasonous treaty," "The German people demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany." The Central Committee of the West German People Opposing Remilitarization and Striving for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty issued a statement on the first reading of the "General Treaty" by the Federal Parliament, saying that the Bonn Parliament has violated the will of the people, and Adenauer and those who support Adenauer have exposed their war plans here. Six and a half million people have voted in the West German public opinion poll against the "General Treaty" and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty. The committee called on all nationally conscious and peace-loving Germans to unite more closely and further develop the "German Unification" movement. The committee also called on the West German people to hold rallies, demonstrations, and strikes to demand that the members of the Bonn Parliament oppose this war treaty.

### 西德议会通过“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约第一读  雷曼号召西德人民迫使阿登纳政府辞职

    西德议会通过“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约第一读
    雷曼号召西德人民迫使阿登纳政府辞职
    【新华社十七日讯】波恩消息：西德联邦议会经过为时两天的讨论以后，已违反德国人民的意志而在七月十日通过“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约的第一读。在讨论中，西德“总理”阿登纳竭力促使议会迅速批准这些条约。现在，这两个条约已交给波恩议会的七个委员会去“研究”。据路透社波恩十日电说：“举行重要表决的第二读和第三读，预料将在九月或十月间进行。”
    在波恩议会的讨论中，舒马赫的右翼社会民主党党徒们再一次暴露了他们是德国人民的叛徒。他们的代表在波恩议会中发表哗众取宠的演说，口头上表示反对“一般性条约”，但是到投票的时候，所有的社会民主党议员就都和阿登纳政府执政党议员一道投票赞成这些条约了。为了缓和西德广大人民，特别是社会民主党下层党员的不满情绪，社会民主党议会党组在议会中提出建议，要求苏、美、英、法四占领国尽快举行会议讨论德国恢复统一问题。这个建议因为没有一个执政党的议员敢于投票反对而被一致通过。
    在波恩议会中，唯一投票反对“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约的，是德国共产党的议员。德国共产党主席雷曼在议会中发表了长篇演说，揭露这两个奴役性条约的实质。他指出：签订“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约是卖国的行为，联邦议会议员应该拒绝批准这些条约。“一般性条约”加深德国的分裂，阻挠四大国取得协议并缔结对德和约，剥夺德国人民的主权，而使西德继续在外国帝国主义占领和奴役之下，使西德变成外国的军事基地和战场，驱使西德人民去做“欧洲军”的炮灰。雷曼说：德国人民面前只有一条道路可以保证他们作为一个独立的民族生存下去，这条道路就是和平恢复德国统一，缔结对德和约及撤退一切占领军。走这条道路是有实际可能性的，因为苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议是以保证恢复德国主权和保证德国成为一个统一、独立的国家这种条件为基础的。雷曼号召西德人民积极行动起来，反对批准和实施“一般性条约”，迫使阿登纳卖国政府辞职，争取缔结和约。
    在波恩议会以外，西德人民对各右翼政党的态度是很明白的。正当“一般性条约”与“欧洲防务集团”条约通过之时，波恩城内街上到处贴满了这样的标语：“一般性条约完全是一个卖国条约”，
    “德国人民要求缔结对德和约”。西德人民反对重新军国主义化争取缔结和约中央委员会对联邦议会一读通过“一般性条约”一事发表声明说：波恩议会违反了人民的意志，阿登纳和支持阿登纳的人们已经在这里暴露了他们的战争计划。西德民意投票中已有六百五十万人民投票反对“一般性条约”，并要求缔结和约。委员会号召一切具有民族意识并爱好和平的德国人更紧密地团结一致，进一步展开
    “德国统一”运动。委员会还号召西德人民举行集会、示威及罢工，要求波恩议会议员反对这个战争条约。
