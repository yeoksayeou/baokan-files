    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th] On July 11th, U.S. aircraft indiscriminately bombed peaceful residents in and near Pyongyang City, causing a serious bloodbath in the No. 9 POW camp near Pyongyang, resulting in 110 casualties among enemy prisoners of war. General Nam Il, chief representative of our side's Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, lodged a strong protest with the other side regarding this bloody incident. The full text of the protest is as follows:

    To Major General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

    On July 11, 1952, at approximately 23:00 hours, your military aircraft bombed and strafed our No. 9 POW camp located in Mo-hyon-ri, near Pyongyang. Thirteen of your prisoners of war were killed by the bombing, nineteen were seriously injured, fifty-three were slightly injured, and twenty-five are missing. I lodge a strong protest with your side regarding this major bloodbath. This POW camp has clear markings in accordance with the agreement between both sides, and its precise location has long been notified to your side. Your indiscriminate bombing is a complete violation of the agreement. Your side has yet to address the five incidents of bombing and strafing of our POW camps, and now a new serious incident of indiscriminate bombing of our No. 9 POW camp has occurred. This once again proves beyond any doubt that your side wantonly violates international law and humanitarian principles, and in order to implement your barbaric policy of bombing peaceful cities, you do not hesitate to kill your own prisoners of war. Your side must immediately take responsible action regarding this serious and bloody incident. Any attempt to evade responsibility or continued violation of the agreement between the two sides will only aggravate your culpability.

    General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation
                                July 13, 1952

    On the 13th, both delegation plenums continued administrative meetings.

    美机滥炸平壤造成杀害美方战俘重大血案
    我方向美方提出严重抗议
    十三日朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会继续进行行政性会议
    【新华社开城十三日电】七月十一日美机狂轰滥炸平壤市及其近郊的和平居民，造成平壤近郊第九号战俘营中对方被俘人员死伤一百十名的严重血案。我方朝鲜停战谈判代表团首席代表南日将军对这一血腥事件向对方提出严重抗议，抗议全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    你方军用飞机在一九五二年七月十一日二十三时左右轰炸扫射位于平壤墨岘里的我方第九号战俘营。你方被俘人员十三名被炸死，十九名受重伤，五十三名受轻伤，二十五名下落不明。对此次重大血案，我向你方提出严重抗议。该战俘营按照双方的协议设有清晰的标志，其精确位置早已通知你方。你方的滥炸是完全违反协议的。你方对五次轰炸和扫射我方战俘营事件迄今尚未处理，而又发生了滥炸我方第九号战俘营新的严重事件。这就又一次无可置辩地证明了你方恣意违反国际法和人道原则，为了执行你方轰炸和平城市的野蛮政策，不惜杀害你方的被俘人员。你方必须立即对此次严重血腥事件作负责的处理。任何推卸责任的企图与继续违反双方协议的行为只能加重你方的罪责。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
                                一九五二年七月十三日
    十三日双方代表团大会继续进行行政性会议。
