    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. The American aggressors once again massacred our captured personnel at the Nonsan POW camp on the Korean mainland on the 9th. According to reports from American and British news agencies, more than 20 of our captured personnel were wounded.
    In order to cover up their crimes, the American aggressors, as usual, publicized this massacre as "internal warfare" and "fighting" among our captured personnel. However, the news released by American and British news agencies on the same day, full of loopholes, completely exposed the American aggressors' deception. An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 10th said: American guards in the POW camp rushed into a group of "rebellious communist prisoners" and suppressed their "demonstration." United Press International fabricated that "U.S. military guards did not use bayonets or tear gas." But Reuters quoted a spokesman for the Eighth Army as saying: "American guards rushed in and used tear gas." The facts are extremely clear: the American aggressors arbitrarily massacred our captured personnel, and this is the truth of the Nonsan incident.
    It is worth noting that our captured personnel in the POW camps on the Korean mainland have always been publicized by the U.S. side as "rather willing to commit suicide than to return." However, in these POW camps, bloody incidents of massacres of our captured personnel have repeatedly broken out. In Busan, the U.S. military killed and wounded 86 of our captured personnel; in Yeongcheon, the U.S. military killed and wounded 16 of our captured personnel; in Nonsan, this time more than 20 people were wounded.
    These facts show that the U.S. side is still attempting to detain our prisoners of war in large numbers, and is still attempting to use their completely bankrupt propaganda trick of so-called "voluntary repatriation" to obstruct the realization of the universally anticipated Korean armistice.

### 美国侵略者又在论山屠杀我方被俘人员

    美国侵略者又在论山屠杀我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城十二日电】美国侵略者九日又一度屠杀在朝鲜大陆上论山战俘营的我方被俘人员。据美英通讯社透露，我方被俘人员共被打伤二十余人。
    美国侵略者为了掩饰他们的罪行，照例把这次屠杀事件宣传为我方被俘人员之间的“内战”和“格斗”。但是美英通讯社在同一天发出的破绽百出的消息，完全暴露了美国侵略者的骗局。美联社釜山十日电说：战俘营的美国警卫冲进一群“叛逆的共产党俘虏中”，镇压了他们的“示威运动”。合众社捏造说：“美军警卫未使用刺刀和催泪瓦斯。”但路透社却引用了第八军一个发言人的话说：“美国警卫冲进去使用了催泪瓦斯。”事实极为明显：美国侵略者恣意屠杀我方被俘人员，这就是论山事件的真相。
    值得注意的是，在朝鲜大陆战俘营的我方被俘人员，一直是被美方宣传为“宁愿自杀也不愿回去”的。但是在这些战俘营中，却一再爆发了我方被俘人员被大批屠杀的血腥事件。在釜山，美军曾打死打伤我方被俘人员八十六人；在永川，美军曾打死打伤我方被俘人员十六人；在论山，这一次又打伤二十余人。
    这些事实说明了美方仍在企图大批扣留我方战俘，仍在企图用他们已经彻底破产了的所谓“自愿遣返”的宣传骗局来阻挠举世瞩望的朝鲜停战的实现。
