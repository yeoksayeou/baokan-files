Contribute All My Strength to the Party
    Cao Weimin
    The great "July 1st" has arrived. As I commemorate the Party's birthday with immense excitement, I think of the Party's cultivation and education of me over the past few years, and I have much to say.
    In the old society, I was a mathematics teacher in a middle school in Xiangxiang, Hunan. In 1949, when our army liberated Hunan and marched into Guangdong and Guangxi, I joined the army. After joining the army, the organization assigned me to be a cultural instructor in a teaching team of a certain unit. At first, I thought that I had received higher education in the old society and had some foundation in mathematics, so I felt that teaching such simple arithmetic would be easy; but in fact, it was not that simple. The first time I taught decimal addition, I still used the old methods, starting from principles and formulas to explain. After explaining for a long time, everyone still couldn't understand "why the decimal points must be aligned when adding decimals." I couldn't think of a better way to explain, and I was very anxious. After class, an instructor said to me: "Teaching must understand the specific situation below. You should discuss and consult with everyone more. They will tell you many methods."
    This conversation was very enlightening to me. From then on, I went to the classes every day to understand the situation. I found a student named Zhang Fushan who had a good foundation in arithmetic, so I asked him to study with me. Zhang Fushan said: "You only talk about adding the ones place of integers and the ones place, and adding the tenths place of decimals and the tenths place. It is naturally difficult for everyone to understand; if you change it to three stones and five dou of grain plus three stones and five dou of grain, adding stones with stones and dou with dou, everyone will easily understand." I did it according to his method, and sure enough, everyone quickly understood.
    This incident further deeply educated me. I began to realize that those old mathematical principles and methods were no longer applicable. Now, new mathematical principles and methods are needed, and these can only be found among the masses.
    From then on, I went deep into the masses and engaged in suppressing bandits, training soldiers, carrying water, planting vegetables, chopping firewood, building dikes, and repairing playgrounds with everyone. My scalp was sunburned, and my shoulders were swollen, but I worked the same as the students. The soldiers thought: "The instructor can endure hardships." In this way, I became one with everyone in terms of thoughts and feelings, my horizons also broadened, and I found many teaching materials that could not be found in books. For example, when shooting targets, I saw some soldiers "eating sesame cakes" when shooting, and I thought of the usage of "○" in multiplication; on the playground, I saw the soldiers climbing the straight pillars of the horizontal bar, and I thought of how to explain the height of a trapezoid; when eating, I heard the soldiers say that two tables of the same length, their widths are different, the wider one is larger than the narrower one, and I knew that the soldiers had a rudimentary concept of area. I felt that the soldiers' every move often contained some arithmetic concepts. For example, comrades from peasant backgrounds can use stones and soybeans to count, which is equivalent to calculating the area of land and the amount of grain; comrades from small merchant backgrounds can use abacuses and commercial accounting methods; comrades who herded sheep can add the number of sheep one by one; comrades who worked in coal mines can calculate the amount of explosives; comrades who were carpenters know that a six-inch opening is eighteen inches around (circumference is three times the diameter)... Such examples are countless. These comrades' mental arithmetic abilities have greatly developed in the training of military life. For example, when the duty platoon leader gathers the troops, he can calculate the actual number of people present with just a few words; the soldiers never use written calculations when buying and dividing things, but they calculate very accurately. These many vivid facts enlightened me. I thought: They already have a good foundation in arithmetic. They just can't turn these specific algorithms into abstract formulas. If they can combine this mental arithmetic ability with written calculations, they will definitely learn faster.
    Soon, I discovered another situation.
    Among the students in the teaching team, there was a deputy instructor named Liu Fuhai. At first, his arithmetic foundation was very poor, but later he made rapid progress in his studies. I asked him curiously, and he said: "I have no other tricks, I just memorized the 'Nine-Nine' multiplication table for addition and multiplication very well; when others are calculating, they have to move their fingers and think for a long time, but I can say it right away." Another company commander named Yang Hongshen was slow at calculating because he didn't know the "Nine-Nine" multiplication table, so I told him to memorize the "Nine-Nine" multiplication table by heart, and sure enough, his progress was much faster. Later, I taught several other people, and their calculation speed also greatly increased. I understood: if students are familiar with this tool, they can concentrate their efforts on thinking about algorithms and arithmetic when solving problems, which will greatly accelerate the process of learning arithmetic.
    In my work, I observed and thought, and became more and more certain that the time for arithmetic teaching could be shortened. I really wanted to experiment with what I had learned. In January 1951, I obtained the consent of the leaders in the teaching team and first organized the office staff of the team headquarters to conduct a trial teaching. Before the trial teaching, I carefully studied the textbook, systematically organized the teaching materials, and found that many difficulties were no longer difficult after the students memorized the "Nine-Nine" multiplication table and combined it with mental arithmetic explanations. Some minor difficulties can be solved outside of class, so you can concentrate your efforts and use the things that the students are most familiar with to make key breakthroughs in the classroom; the teaching time can be greatly shortened.
    The results of the first trial teaching proved that this approach was correct. After two weeks (fourteen hours), most people learned division, which further increased my confidence. In the second trial teaching in 1951, the original teaching content of four hundred hours was completed in sixty-four hours.
    In March of this year, the South China Military Region held the Second Representative Conference of Cultural Instructors. I reported my teaching experience at the meeting. With the help of the Party and superior leaders, I continued to experiment, and the results were very good. In early May, the South China Military Region held an Arithmetic Research Conference, which continued to improve the arithmetic teaching experience and decided to widely promote it in various troops in Central and Southern China.
    The Party and the superiors gave me credit and promotion because I made a small contribution to arithmetic teaching; the military region also awarded me a first-class certificate and the title of "Model Instructor." This time, the General Political Department of the Military Commission transferred me to Beijing for experimentation. This is truly the greatest glory of my life. But this glory is not my personal glory, it belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao. Without the leadership and education of the Party and the joint efforts of all cultural education workers and student comrades, it would have been impossible for me to make any contribution to arithmetic teaching, let alone have such achievements today.
    Looking back, in the old society, I was just an ordinary "schoolteacher." Although I taught for nearly four years, because the education of the old society was not for the service of the people, I did not make any progress. After coming to the revolutionary ranks, through the education and cultivation of the Party, my class consciousness was raised, and I gradually integrated with the soldiers. In the process of constantly learning from the soldiers, I improved and improved my teaching methods, so that I can have such glory today.
    New and complete arithmetic teaching methods still need to be created by the masses. Today, our troops are improving culture in order to build a strong national defense force and to defeat the aggression of American imperialism. This is a serious combat mission. I am a member of the Communist Youth League. Today, when welcoming the Party's birthday, I express my determination to the Party and the superiors: I will never slacken and be satisfied because of the current small achievements. I must further improve my class consciousness, strengthen my political cultivation, study with an open mind, work hard to study my business, and better go deep into the masses, so that the experience of arithmetic teaching will have new development on the original basis, contribute all my strength to the Party, and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

### 为党贡献自己的一切力量

    为党贡献自己的一切力量
    曹卫民
    伟大的“七一”来到了。当我以无比兴奋的心情来纪念党的生日的时候，我想起了党几年来对我的培养和教育，我有很多的话想要说出来。
    在旧社会里，我曾在湖南湘乡一个中学里当过数学教员，一九四九年我军解放湖南、大举进军两广的时候，我参加了部队。参军后，组织上分配我到某部教导队当文化教员。开始，我认为自己在旧社会里受过高等教育，并且在数学上有些基础，觉得教这种简单的算术是很容易的；但事实上不这样简单。我第一次讲小数加法时，仍然搬出过去的一套，从原理公式出发来讲解。讲了半天，大家还是弄不通“为什么小数相加的时候小数点一定要对准”，我再也想不出更好的方法来解释，心里很着急。下课以后，有一个指导员对我说：“教学一定要了解下面的具体情况，你应该多和大家研究商量，他们会告诉你很多办法的。”
    这次谈话对我的启发很大。从此我每天都深入到班里了解情况。我发现了一个叫张福山的学员，算术基础较好，于是我就找他研究。张福山说：“你只讲整数的个位和个位相加、小数的十分位和十分位相加，这样大家自然不容易听懂；你如果改成三石五斗加三石五斗，石和石相加，斗和斗相加，大家就容易明白了。”我按照他的方法做了，果然大家很快就明白了。
    这一件事情更深深地教育了我。我开始了解到从前那些旧的数学原则和方法已经不适用了，现在需要新的数学原则和方法，而这只有到群众中去寻找。
    从此我就深入到群众中去，和大家一块剿匪、练兵、挑水、种菜、砍柴、筑堤、修操场。我头上晒破了皮，肩膀给压肿了，还是和学员们一样的干。战士们觉得：“教员很能吃苦。”这样从思想感情上和大家打成一片了，我的眼界也扩大了，并且找到了许多书本上找不到的教学素材。譬如打靶的时候，看见有的战士打靶吃了“烧饼”，就想到乘法中关于“○”的用法；在操场上看见战士们爬撑天桥的直柱，就想到怎样解释梯形的高；吃饭的时候，听到战士们说，两张一样长的桌子，它们的宽窄不同，宽的就比窄的大，就知道战士们有粗浅的面积概念。我觉得战士们的一举一动中，常常含有算术的一些概念。譬如农民出身的同志，会用石头黄豆摆数，也等于计算地亩和粮食的数目；小商贩出身的同志会用算盘和商场记数法；看羊出身的同志会一五一十地加羊的数目；下过煤窑的同志会计算炸药的多少；做过木匠的就知道六寸的口子十八寸的周（周三径一）……。诸如这样的例子，不胜枚举。这些同志在部队生活的锻炼中，心算的能力更大大的发展了。譬如值星排长集合队伍时，只用嘴一叨咕就可以算出实到的人数；战士们买东西、分东西，从来都不用笔算，但是他们计算得都很精确。这许多生动的事实启示了我。我想：他们本来都已经有了很好的算术基础，他们只是还不能把这些具体的算法变成抽象的算式；若能使他们这种心算能力和笔算结合起来，一定能学得更快。
    不久，我又发现了一个情况。
    在教导队学员中有一个副指导员叫刘福海。开始他的算术基础很差，可是后来在学习中进步很快；我很奇怪地问他，他说：“我没有别的巧处，就是加法和乘法的‘九九’口诀背得很熟；别人算的时候，要搬指头想上半天，我能张口就来。”另外还有个连长叫杨鸿深，因为他不会“九九”口诀，算得很慢，我就叫他把“九九”口诀背得烂熟，果然他的进步快多了。后来我又教了另外的几个人，他们的计算速度也大大增快。我明白了：使学员熟练了这个工具，他算起题来就能集中力量去思考算法算理，这样就会大大加速学好算术的过程。
    在工作中我一面观察，一面思索，愈来愈肯定算术教学的时间是可以缩短的。我很想把自己体会到的东西实验一下。一九五一年一月，我在教导队取得了领导方面的同意，先把队部事务人员组织起来进行试教。在试教以前，仔细研究了课本，系统地组织了教材，发现有很多难点在使学员背熟了“九九”口诀并结合心算讲解之后，就不成为难点了。还有些次要的难点一戳就破，可以放在课外解决，这样就可以集中力量，运用学员最熟悉的事物，在课堂上重点突破；教学时间就可大大缩短。
    第一次试教的结果，证明这种做法是正确的。经过两个星期（十四小时），大部分人都学到除法，这更增加了我的信心。一九五一年第二次试教中，就用六十四小时完成了原定四百小时的教学内容。
    今年三月，华南军区召开了第二次文化教员代表会议。我在会上报告了教学体会。在党和上级领导同志的帮助之下，又连续进行了实验，收效很好。五月初旬，华南军区又召开了算术研究会议，将算术教学经验加以继续提高，并决定在中南各部队中广泛推行。
    党和上级因我对算术教学有了一点微小的贡献，给我立功晋级；军区又授予我一等奖状和“模范教员”的称号。这次军委总政治部又调我来北京进行实验。这真是我一生最大的光荣。但这光荣不是我个人的光荣，是属于党和毛主席的。没有党的领导教育和全体文化教育工作同志和学员同志们的共同努力，我就不可能在算术教学上有所贡献，更不可能有今天这样的成就。
    回想我在旧社会里，只是一个普通的“教书匠”，虽然教过近四年的书，但由于旧社会的教育不是为人民大众服务的，因此我没有一点长进。来到革命队伍以后，经过党的教育培养，提高了我的阶级觉悟，使我逐渐和战士们结合起来；在不断向战士学习的过程中，改进和提高了我的教学方法，才能有今天这样的光荣。
    新的、完整的算术教学方法，还需要群众继续创造。今天我们部队提高文化是为了建设强大的国防军，为了打垮美帝国主义的侵略，这是一个严重的战斗任务。我是一个青年团员，今天在迎接党的生日的时候，我向党和上级表示决心：我绝不因目前的一点小成绩就松劲满足，我一定要更进一步地提高阶级觉悟，加强政治修养，虚心学习，努力钻研业务，更好地深入群众，使算术教学的一些经验在原有的基础上更有新的发展，为党贡献出自己的一切力量，争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
