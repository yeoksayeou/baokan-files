    Taiyuan Coal Construction Company Should Not Hoard Coal
    Editor: The Taiyuan Branch of the China Coal Construction Company has accumulated 21,549 tons of coal at the Xuan’gang Station on the Datong-Puzhou Railway for more than half a year without transporting and selling it. We have urged them several times, but they have not yet loaded it. At 50,000 yuan per ton, this is more than 1 billion yuan of state funds tied up, what a huge loss! I hope the Taiyuan Branch thoroughly examines its work.

    太原煤建公司不应积压煤
    编辑同志：中国煤建公司太原分公司在同蒲铁路轩岗车站积存二万一千五百四十九吨煤，半年多了还不运销，我们曾几次催促他们，但至今还没有装运。每吨煤以五万元计算，就积压了国家资金十亿多元，这是多大的损失！我希望太原分公司彻底检查一下自己的工作。
