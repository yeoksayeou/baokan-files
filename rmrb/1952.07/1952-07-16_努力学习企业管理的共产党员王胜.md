    Communist Party Member Wang Sheng Diligently Studies Enterprise Management
    Zhang Zhiqing
    After the national liberation, batches of Communist Party members entered factories and mines with confidence. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words: "The important thing is to be good at learning." In order to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party, they studied tirelessly, determined to become experts. Communist Party member Wang Sheng is one of them.
    Wang Sheng is from Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, and joined the revolutionary work in 1937. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, he struggled arduously and worked diligently for the Party and the people's revolutionary cause.
    In April of this year, Wang Sheng took on a position in industrial production. When he first arrived at the Baoding Power Plant, he did encounter many difficulties. Because he came from the countryside, he knew nothing about industry. When he talked to the workers, they would use terms like watts, water pumps, and adjusting load, which he didn't understand at all. When the workers held meetings to discuss production plans, he couldn't interject. At this time, he felt that he couldn't lead the workers without understanding technology; but his technical knowledge was too limited, so he once had feelings of distress and annoyance, and thought about studying at a specialized school for a period before working. But then he thought of what Stalin said: school is only a preparatory stage, and cadres' actual training comes from actual work, outside of school. But how exactly could he get practical training? He studied "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and saw that Chairman Mao had long clearly pointed out: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand, we must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, learn honestly, if you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Delve into it, a few months, a year or two, three to five years, you can always learn it." He read it over and over, and his mind became clear, increasing his courage and confidence in learning to manage enterprises. He firmly believed that there were no difficulties that could not be overcome by relying on the masses. So he made up his mind to learn humbly from engineering personnel, asking questions about anything he didn't understand; and at the same time, he went deep into the workshops and workers' dormitories, talked with the workers, and learned from them. In this way, he quickly established a deep relationship with everyone. Every time he went to the workshop, the workers would take the initiative to explain production knowledge to him. When repairing machines, he would climb into the boiler with the workers to see the structure of the boiler and the function of each part; he would participate in the technical studies of the employees every time. After the patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign was launched, he saw that the engineers and apprentices had signed master-apprentice contracts; he felt that although he was the factory director, in terms of technology, he was not as good as the apprentices, so he took the initiative to find an engineer and signed a master-apprentice contract. The engineer gave him a book on electrical engineering, which he studied diligently every day. After more than two months of learning, he understood a lot about the names of machines and the principles of electricity. In the early days of his arrival at the factory, every time he went to the Baoding Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau to report on his work, he could only read from the written materials, and when asked about the specifics, he couldn't say; now he can explain the reasoning when reporting on his work. The comrades at the Enterprise Bureau felt that his change was sudden, and asked him: "How did you become so familiar with electrical engineering so quickly?" His answer was: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. As long as you listen to Chairman Mao's words, 'delve into it,' rely on the workers, and learn humbly, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Yes, in the past, when a machine broke down, he would worry anxiously but couldn't find the problem; now, not only can he find the cause of the accident, but he can also propose ways to improve and prevent accidents. In the past, he couldn't judge which rationalization proposals put forward by the workers could be adopted; now it's completely different, he not only understands the role and purpose of each rationalization proposal, but also can make preliminary judgments and propose preliminary handling opinions.
    Although he has made such great progress, he is not at all proud or complacent. He said very modestly: "I want to be an honest primary school student of the workers. My production knowledge is still far from meeting the requirements of the Party and the people. I will never be complacent, and I am determined to learn from all experts, make greater achievements for the Party and the people, and strive to welcome large-scale economic construction."

    努力学习企业管理的共产党员王胜
    张志清
    全国解放以后，成批的共产党员满怀信心地走进了厂矿。他们都牢牢地记住了毛主席的话：“重要的问题在善于学习。”他们为完成党所给的光荣任务，孜孜不倦地学习着，决心成为内行人。共产党员王胜，就是其中的一个。
    王胜是山西省襄垣县人，一九三七年参加革命工作。在抗日战争和人民解放战争中，坚苦奋斗，忠心为党和人民的革命事业积极工作。
    今年四月，王胜走上工业生产岗位。他刚到保定市发电厂工作时，他确实遇到过很多困难。因为他来自农村，对工业一门不摸，和工人们说起话来，工人们张嘴就是什么瓦特、水泵、调整负荷等名词术语，他一点也听不懂。工人们开会讨论生产计划时，他无法插嘴。这时他感到不懂技术，是没法领导工人的；可是他的技术知识太少了，因此曾一度产生苦恼厌烦情绪，总想到专门学校学习一个时期再工作。可是他又想到斯大林所说的，学校——只不过是一个准备阶段，干部的实际锻炼是在实际工作中，是在学校外面得来的。但到底怎样去实际锻炼呢？他学习了“论人民民主专政”，看到毛主席早就清楚地指出：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西，我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学，不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”他读了又读，心里亮堂了，增加了学习管理企业的勇气和信心。他深信依靠群众没有克服不了的困难。于是下定决心，一面向工程人员虚心学习，有不懂得的事情就问；一面深入车间、工人宿舍，和工人谈心，向他们学习。就这样，他很快就和大伙建立了深厚的感情。他每次到车间，工人们都主动地给他讲解生产知识。在检修机器时，他和工人一同钻到锅炉里，看锅炉的构造和每个机件的作用；职工们研究技术时，他每次都要参加。爱国增产节约竞赛运动展开后，他看到工程师和学徒订了师徒合同；他觉得自己虽然是厂长，按技术来说，还不如学徒，他就主动地找到工程师订了师徒合同。工程师给了他一本电学，他每天苦心钻研。经过两个多月的学习，机器名称和电的原理都懂得了许多。他到工厂的初期，每次到保定市人民政府企业局汇报工作时，只能按着文字念念，一问具体情况就说不上来了；现在他汇报工作时，都能讲出道理来。企业局的同志们感到他的变化很突然，就问他：“你怎么对电学熟悉得这样快？”他的回答是：“世上无难事，就怕用心人。只要听毛主席的话，‘钻进去’，依靠工人，虚心学习，没有克服不了的困难。”是的，以前机器出了事故，他干着急找不出毛病来，现在他不但能找出发生事故的原因，还能提出改进、预防事故的办法。过去工人提出的合理化建议，他不能判断那些能采用；现在完全不同了，他不仅懂得了每件合理化建议的作用和目的，还能作出初步的判断，提出初步的处理意见。
    虽然他有了这样大的进步，但他毫不骄傲自满，他很谦虚地说：“我要老老实实地当工人的小学生。我的生产知识还远远赶不上党和人民对我的要求，我决不自满，决心向一切内行人学习，为党和人民作出更大的成绩，为迎接大规模的经济建设而努力。”
