People of Various Countries Protest US Bombing of Yalu River Power Plants
French "l'Humanité" Sternly Condemns US Provocative Acts

    In an article commemorating the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against US aggression, Goutard, editor of the French Communist Party's newspaper "l'Humanité," sternly condemned the provocative act of the US aggressors in bombing the Yalu River power plants.
    Goutard pointed out: This action reveals the terrible truth about the State Department's policy towards Asia. "Now no one can deny that Washington has not given up turning the Korean War into a hotbed for a world war." This also explains why the United States has systematically disrupted the Panmunjom armistice talks and waged germ warfare.
    Goutard continued: "During the changing two years, the reason why the Korean War has not expanded, and the rope that maintains world peace has been able to continue, we should first thank the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has consistently demanded an end to the war to find a fair solution. Since the first day of the war, it has been working for this."
    "We also have to thank the People's China. The Chinese People's Volunteers crushed MacArthur's offensive to Northeast China eighteen months ago, which offensive was a prelude to a full-scale war to 're-conquer' Asia."
     "And we thank the admirable Korean people and the Korean People's Army. Their resistance to aggression is a major event of greater significance in history."

Pakistani People Condemn New US Crimes

    A "Pakistan Times" reporter reported from Dhaka: People in East Pakistan are furious about the barbaric bombing of the Yalu River power plants by US aircraft. The reporter of the newspaper said: Kind people now regard the United States as "the enemy of peace on earth and the instigator of the Third World War." Various daily newspapers published in Bengali in Dhaka City strongly condemned the new crimes of the American soldiers, saying that these crimes are "the final rehearsal of the United States to expand the Korean War." "Sangbad" said: These bombings indicate that the United States is continuing to implement MacArthur's policy. "The recent bombing has international importance, and anyone who cherishes peace will definitely worry about the future of peace."
     "Azad" said in an article entitled "Ominous Sign": "No one anywhere will approve of the bombing of hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River by US planes."

Japanese Socialist Party Left-Wing Criticizes US Aircraft's Atrocities

    After a special meeting on June 30, the Central Executive Committee of the Left-Wing of the Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement criticizing the barbaric bombing of the Yalu River power plants by US aircraft. The Central Executive Committee of the Left-Wing of the Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese government immediately stop rearming.

British Newspapers Sternly Criticize Clark for Being Simple-Minded

    Several British bourgeois newspapers continue to condemn the serious provocative acts of the US aggressors in indiscriminately bombing non-military facilities such as the Yalu River power plants.
    The British weekly "Observer" published an editorial on June 29 on the bombing of the Yalu River power plants by the US Air Force, saying: "Many people in Britain believe that there are many American officers in Korea who want to expand the war." The editorial pointed out: "Completely upright and patriotic British citizens" cannot help but question "MacArthur has been dismissed, but has his spirit disappeared in the US Command in Korea?" The editorial expressed concern about the British government's policy of following the US aggression against Korea, saying: Can Britain allow itself to be dragged into a full-scale conflict in Asia by reckless American officers—even if it is not a world war?
    The "Sunday Pictorial," which sells five million copies, published an article on June 29 with the headline "General Clark, Some Strange Things," expressing concern about the serious provocation of the US aggressors in indiscriminately bombing the Yalu River power plants, and fiercely criticized Clark, who is implementing the new US provocative policy, saying: "This rude, irritable, hook-nosed, impatient, and stubborn American soldier is well-known." The newspaper pointed out the seriousness of Clark's implementation of this new US provocative policy, saying: "This simple-minded, uncultured, 100% American likes to take risks, but the position he is in now has a pivotal relationship with world peace." The article finally questioned whether Clark was the appropriate person to command the "United Nations forces" in Korea, and asked: "Should General Clark's name be added to the list of those who are incompetent?"

专栏：

    各国人民抗议美国轰炸鸭绿江发电厂
    法“人道报”严斥美国的挑衅行为
    法国共产党机关报“人道报”编辑古达德在纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年的文章中，严正斥责美国侵略者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的挑衅行为。
    古达德指出：这个行动显出了国务院对亚洲政策的可怕真相。“现在没有人能否认：华盛顿方面的人并没有放弃使朝鲜战争成为世界大战的温床。”这也说明了美国为什么有计划地破坏板门店停战谈判及进行细菌战。
    古达德接着指出：“在多变的两年过程中，朝鲜战争之所以没有扩大，维系世界和平的绳索之所以能够仍旧不断，我们首先应该感谢苏联。苏联政府始终不渝地要求终止战争以寻找公平的解决办法。自从战争爆发的第一天起，它就一直为这个工作而努力的。”
    “我们还得感谢人民中国。中国人民志愿军在十八个月前粉碎了麦克阿瑟向中国东北的攻势，这个攻势是‘重新征服’亚洲的全面战争的前奏。”
     “我们并感谢可钦佩的朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军。他们对侵略的反抗是历史上具有更大意义的一件大事。”
    巴基斯坦人民谴责美国新罪行
    “巴基斯坦时报”记者自达卡报道：巴基斯坦东部的人民对美国飞机野蛮轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的行为感到愤怒。该报记者称：善良的人民现在都把美国看作是“地球上的和平的敌人和第三次世界大战煽动者”。达卡城以孟加拉文出版的各种日报，有力地斥责美国军人的新的罪行，说这些罪行是“美国扩大朝鲜战争的最后预演”。“森格巴德报”说：这些轰炸表示美国是在继续执行麦克阿瑟的政策。“最近的轰炸具有国际重要性，凡是珍爱和平的人一定会为和平的前途担忧。”
     “自由报”在一篇题为“不吉之兆”的文章里说：“美机轰炸鸭绿江上的水力发电厂，任何地方的任何人都不会赞成。”
    日本社会党左派抨击美机暴行
    日本社会党左派中央执行委员会在六月三十日举行特别会议后发表声明，抨击美国飞机野蛮轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的行为。社会党左派中央执行委员会要求日本政府立刻停止重新武装。
    英国报纸严斥克拉克头脑简单
    英国若干资产阶级报纸继续谴责美国侵略者滥炸鸭绿江发电厂等非军事设备的严重挑衅行为。
    英国星期日报“观察家报”六月二十九日就美国空军轰炸鸭绿江发电厂一事发表社论说：“英国有许多人相信：在朝鲜有许多美国军官希望扩大战争”。社论指出：“完全正直而爱国的英国公民”不禁要质问“麦克阿瑟已被撤职了，但是他的精神是否已经在朝鲜美国司令部中消失呢？”社论对英国政府追随美国侵略朝鲜的政策表示不安说：英国岂能让它自己被鲁莽的美国军官拖入亚洲全面冲突——即使不是世界大战吗？
    销售五百万份的“星期日画报”，在六月二十九日用通栏标题“克拉克将军，一些怪事”刊文对美国侵略者滥炸鸭绿江发电厂的严重挑衅表示不安，并猛烈抨击执行美国新挑衅政策的克拉克说：“这位粗卤的、脾气暴躁、勾鼻子、没有耐性、而且固执的美国军人已名闻天下了。”该报指出克拉克执行美国这一新挑衅政策的严重性说：“这个脑筋简单、没有修养、百分之百的美国人喜欢冒险，但是他现在所处的地位对于世界和平是有着举足轻重的关系的。”该文最后质问克拉克是不是在朝鲜指挥“联合国军”作战的适当人选，该文问道：“克拉克将军的名字要不要被列入那些不称职的人的名单上去？”
