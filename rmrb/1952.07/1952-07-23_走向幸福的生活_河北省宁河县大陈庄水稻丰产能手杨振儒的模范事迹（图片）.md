    Moving Towards a Happy Life
    —The Model Deeds of Yang Zhenru, a Rice Production Expert in Dachenzhuang, Ninghe County, Hebei Province
    Written by Qin Zheng, Ma Keming, Xu Tiankai, Wang Yutang
    (1) On the vast plains by the Bohai Sea, golden rice paddies exude fragrance. Members of the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative are busily harvesting. Yang Zhenru and the team he leads have achieved a high yield of 1,620 jin per mu. Look! Each rice ear has three hundred grains, and the rice stalks are four chi long!
    (2) The good news of the bumper harvest spread throughout the county and the province. People are listening to the Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station report the good news to the whole country! Yang Zhenru's face is flushed with joy. He says, "Folks! This is all thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government. It is the merit and glory of our entire village! In the old society, we also farmed, but what kind of miserable life was that?"
    (3) The painful years can never be forgotten: The Japanese devils forced us to grow rice, and all the harvested rice was snatched away! When the Kuomintang came, the rule was even more brutal. Fields were barren and overgrown with weeds. They seized pots and pans and demolished houses to collect grain taxes. People couldn't just sit and wait to die. More than half of the eighty households in the village fled...
    (4) In 1948, the People's Liberation Army defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the sunshine of the people's regime illuminated Dachenzhuang. We reorganized our fields and settled down to our businesses. People who had fled returned to their hometowns.
    (5) The People's Government loves the people and called for a three-year tax exemption for land reclamation. Yang Zhaoqing was democratically elected as village head, and Yang Zhenru as production committee member. Yang Zhenru responded to the call of the Communist Party and led everyone to reclaim wasteland.
    (6) Just as grain was within reach, it rained continuously for thirty days in July. The floodwaters merged with the sea, and all the crops were flooded! People sighed and cried in despair. Yang Zhenru was trying to find a way to relieve the disaster.

    走向幸福的生活
    ——河北省宁河县大陈庄水稻丰产能手杨振儒的模范事迹

    （一）渤海边辽阔的平原上，金黄的田稻喷吐着芬香。大陈庄农业生产合作社的社员们正在紧张地收割。杨振儒和他所领导的小队，获得了每亩一千六百二十斤的高额产量，看吧！每一棵稻穗三百粒，稻秆四尺长！
    （二）丰产捷报传遍了全县，全省。人们正在听北京中央人民广播电台向全国报告喜讯！杨振儒乐得满脸红，他说：“乡亲们！这都是毛主席和人民政府领导的好，是咱全庄的功劳和光荣！在旧社会里，咱也种过田，那时候又是什么样的苦光景？”
    （三）痛苦的年月永远也忘不掉：日本鬼子强迫种水稻，收下的稻谷都被抢走！国民党来了，统治更凶残，田园荒芜生野草，拔锅拆房顶粮款，活人不能坐等死，全庄八十户逃走了一大半……
    （四）一九四八年，人民解放军打垮了蒋匪帮，人民政权的阳光照亮了大陈庄，重整田园安家业，逃离的人们回到家乡。
    （五）人民政府爱人民，号召开荒三年不纳粮，民主选举村长杨兆庆和生产委员杨振儒，杨振儒响应共产党的号召，领导着大伙去开荒。
    （六）眼看着粮食到嘴边，七月里连雨三十天，洪水和大海连成一片，庄稼全都遭水淹！人们咳声叹气哭丧着脸；杨振儒正想办法救灾荒。
