    Write to the Central People's Government Reporting on their Visit's Gains
   [Xinhua News Agency News] The Southwest, Qamdo, and Qinghai Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation, after visiting Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other places, wrote a letter to the Central People's Government upon their return, thanking the people of various places for their hospitality and reporting on the gains of their visit. The original text of the letter is as follows: Central People's Government, and forwarded to the Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan People's Governments:
    We, the Southwest, Qamdo, and Qinghai Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation, under the deep care of our great leader Chairman Mao and the meticulous and warm care of leaders and comrades in various places, as well as the broad masses of the people, have successfully concluded our visiting schedule. Now, all representatives are returning to their respective places with joyful and excited hearts. Please allow us to extend our sincere thanks to the leaders and comrades and report on the gains of our visit and the things we will do after returning:
    We came from the distant Southwest and Northwest to the interior, and successively visited major cities such as the capital, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Wuhan, as well as many factories, schools, scenic spots, and historical sites in these cities. In the capital, we paid our respects to our great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and participated in the grand “May 1st” Labor Day celebrations. Through this visit, we deeply realized the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, the unparalleled warmth and affection in the big family of the motherland. In particular, we saw the great achievements of various construction undertakings in our motherland in the two or three years since liberation under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. This has enabled us to see more clearly the glorious, splendid, beautiful, and happy future of our motherland, and has increased our infinite confidence and strength in building various undertakings in our minority areas. Now, each of our representatives has drafted preliminary plans. After returning, the first thing we will do is to widely and deeply publicize everything we have seen and heard during this visit to the masses. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao, listen to all instructions from Chairman Mao, ensure that we accept the leadership of the People's Government and the help of the Han elder brothers, eliminate narrow nationalism, and enable our minority ethnic groups to develop and progress rapidly. Especially since we are located on the border of the motherland, we must unite as one, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, carry out patriotic and internationalist education, and consolidate the national defense of our motherland. Dear leaders and comrades, although we have only spent a short time together, we have established a deep affection between us. Under the leadership and education of Chairman Mao, your spirit of serving the people with dedication and enthusiasm has moved us to tears. Now, please convey to the working comrades who have received us and the staff and workers, students, and other relevant units of the factories, schools, and organs we have visited, as well as the citizens who applauded and cheered for us on the streets, that in addition to expressing our deep gratitude to them, we guarantee to do the above work well in order to repay everyone's love and expectations for us. Finally, we shout: Long live the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China!
