    Soviet Navy Day
    Soviet Navy Major General A. Madoshujin
    July 27th – Soviet Navy Day – is a festival for all the Soviet people. This festival was established thirteen years ago, in 1939, by the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to mobilize the broad masses to build the Soviet Navy.

    The Soviet people love, care for, and support their powerful navy. Soviet naval personnel, together with Soviet army personnel and Stalin's eagle air force, are vigilantly defending the inviolability of the socialist state's borders.

    The Soviet people cherish and persistently carry forward the glorious traditions of Russian naval personnel, explorers, naval commanders, and brilliant inventors and scientists. Russia should be ranked first in the world in the construction of submarines, torpedo boats, naval mine weapons, shipbuilding electrical technology, and many other most important combat and technical tools of the navy.

    Since ancient times, Russian ships have sailed to the farthest corners of the earth. Many oceans, straits, islands, and the Pacific coast were discovered, surveyed, and recorded by Russian sailors. The credit for discovering the Antarctic continent also belongs to Russian navigators Lazarev and Bellingshausen.

    World-renowned naval commanders such as Ushakov, Lazarev, Nakhimov, and Makarov have won brilliant honors for the Russian Navy with their victories. No navy in the world has such a glorious page in its history as the Russian Navy. The heroic tradition of the Russian Navy is a tradition of love for the sea, a spirit of courage and perseverance in overcoming difficulties, and a tradition of infinite loyalty to the motherland, nurtured by the people for centuries.

    From the first day of the birth of the Soviet state, the great leaders of the revolution, Lenin and Stalin, paid great attention to the establishment of the Soviet Navy.

    In 1922, the Lenin Communist Youth League assumed the obligation of helping the navy. The Communist Youth League organization gave the navy an excellent supplement. Many young patriots working on ships entered specialized schools and became the basic cadres of the Soviet Navy.

    The country's industrialization and the successful completion of several pre-war Stalin Five-Year Plans created the necessary conditions for the large-scale establishment of a powerful Soviet Navy. During the first two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union built more than four times as many warships as Tsarist Russia built in the decade before World War I.

    Comrade Stalin has always been very concerned about the growth and development of the navy.

    Zhdanov once said: "Comrade Stalin is the first initiator and inspirer of the establishment of a powerful Soviet fleet and naval armed forces, just as he is the initiator and inspirer of all our undertakings, large and small, and all our achievements and victories in solving the tasks of socialist construction."

    The powerful navy of the Soviet state, created by the care of the Party and the government, heroically defended the beloved motherland during the harsh years of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against the Hitler bandits. The Soviet naval personnel, cultivated by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, demonstrated patriotism, high military skills, and examples of self-sacrificing spirit to defend the fruits of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Soviet naval personnel performed miraculous feats in defending the heroic cities of Leningrad, Odessa, Sevastopol, and Stalingrad.

    The defenders of Sevastopol – naval personnel – were honored with glory as heroes. The Soviet army repelled the frantic attacks of the ferocious Hitler bandits for two hundred and fifty days and defended this glorious city of Russia. Thousands of naval soldiers from warships carried out landing operations and inflicted heavy damage on the invaders. The names of the heroes of the Black Sea Fleet – naval soldiers such as Firyuchnikov, Tsybrik, Krasnoselsky, and many other heroic defenders of Sevastopol – are forever engraved in the memory of the people. In his congratulatory message to the defenders of Sevastopol in 1942, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The selfless struggle of the heroes of Sevastopol is an example of heroism for the entire Red Army and the Soviet people."

    During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the navy inflicted huge losses on the enemy, sinking thousands of enemy warships, transport ships, and submarines.

    The Party and the government highly appreciated the merits of naval personnel in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the socialist motherland. Five hundred and thirteen naval personnel were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. For their military exploits in the Great Patriotic War, the government awarded naval personnel more than 350,000 medals and decorations.

    The sincere words of Comrade Stalin, the leader and friend of the working people, are the highest praise for naval personnel:

    "Soviet naval personnel showed unparalleled steadfastness and courage, high combat activity and military skills in combat. Sailors on submarines and warships, naval aviators, gunners, and marine infantry all inherited and developed all the precious traditions of the Russian Navy. In the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Barents Sea, in the Volga River, the Danube River, and the Dnieper River, Soviet naval officers and soldiers have written new pages in the glorious history of the Russian Navy during these four years of war. The navy has thoroughly fulfilled its duty to the Soviet motherland."

    The friendship between the Soviet people and their army is unbreakable. During the harsh years of the war, the working people spared no effort to provide the beloved army, navy, and air force with all the necessary materials to fight the enemy. The unity of the front and the rear, and the constant care of the entire people for the defenders of the motherland, is one of the decisive factors that guaranteed the Soviet Union's historically significant victory over German fascism and Japanese imperialism.

    The funds donated by the Soviet people for building warships were endless. From 1943 to the end of the war, one hundred and fifty warships were built with voluntary donations from Soviet patriots.

    After the victory of the war, the Soviet people began peaceful creative labor with redoubled efforts and achieved brilliant victories in the great cause of building communism.

    The motherland entrusted the task of defending the Soviet sea defense and communication lines to the glorious navy, which is vigilantly defending the motherland against enemy invasion.

    The Soviet people are working selflessly to strengthen the combat power of the Soviet Navy. Many new shipyards have been started and warships are being built smoothly. Soviet industry equips the navy with the most advanced technology. Workers, engineers, and technicians in the shipbuilding industry have demonstrated a high example of Stakhanovite labor in the development of the beloved navy.

    The Soviet working people are welcoming the national festival – Navy Day – in the new glorious victories of building communism and in peaceful creative labor. The great Soviet Union is unswervingly defending peace and security throughout the world. Millions of ordinary people all over the world, preparing to give a firm rebuff to the warmongers, are uniting more and more closely around the great banner of peace – the Soviet Union.

    苏联海军节
    苏联海军少将  阿·玛都什金
    七月二十七日——苏联海军节——是苏联全体人民的节日。这个节日是由苏联政府和联共（布）中央委员会，在十三年前即一九三九年，为了动员广大群众建立苏联海军而规定的。
    苏联人民热爱、关注和支援自己的强大海军。苏联海军军人和苏联陆军军人、斯大林之鹰的空军一起，正警惕地保卫着社会主义国家疆界的不可侵犯性。
    苏联人民珍惜并坚持地发扬俄国海军军人、探险家、海军统帅、天才的发明家和科学家们的光荣传统。在建造潜水艇、鱼雷艇、水雷武器、造船电气技术以及许多其他海军最重要的战斗的、技术的工具方面，俄国应占世界第一位。
    俄国的舰船，自古以来就在地球最遥远的各个角落航行着。许多海洋、海峡、岛屿、太平洋沿岸都是由俄国海员们发现、考察和记载的。发现南极洲大陆的功绩也同样是属于俄国航海家拉扎列夫和别林斯格乌金的。
    举世闻名的海军统帅，如乌沙科夫、拉扎列夫、纳希莫夫、玛卡洛夫曾以他们的胜利为俄国海军获得了辉煌荣誉。在世界上没有一个海军在其历史中有像俄国这样的光辉灿烂的篇页。俄国海军的英雄传统是由多世纪所养成的对海的热爱，对克服困难的勇敢精神和不屈不挠精神，对祖国无限忠诚的人民传统。
    自苏维埃国家诞生的头一天起，革命的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林就对建立苏联海军寄予巨大注意。
    在一九二二年，列宁共产主义青年团负起了帮助海军的义务。共产主义青年团组织给予海军以极好的补充。在舰船上工作的许多青年爱国者进入专门学校，而成为苏联海军的基本干部。
    国家的工业化，战前几个斯大林五年计划的顺利完成，为大规模建立苏联强大海军创造了必要条件。在头两个五年计划内，苏联建造的军舰比沙皇俄国在第一次世界大战前十年内所建造的多四倍以上。
    斯大林同志对海军的壮大和发展，一向非常关怀。
    日丹诺夫曾说过：“斯大林同志是建立苏联强大舰队和海军武装力量的第一个首倡者和鼓舞者，正如他是我们所有大小事业的和在解决社会主义建设任务中我们所有成就和胜利的首倡者和鼓舞者一样。”
    由于党和政府的关怀而创造的苏维埃国家的强大海军，在苏维埃人民抗击希特勒匪徒的伟大卫国战争的严酷年月里，英勇地保卫了亲爱的祖国。由列宁、斯大林党所培养的苏联海军人员表现了爱国主义、高度的军事技艺和以自我牺牲精神来保卫伟大十月社会主义革命果实的范例。苏联海军军人在保卫列宁格勒、敖德萨、塞瓦斯托波尔、斯大林格勒这些英雄城市时，曾完成了神奇的功绩。
    悉瓦斯托波尔的保卫者——海军军人膺受了英雄的光荣。苏联军队击退希特勒凶狠匪徒的疯狂攻击达二百五十天，而保卫了俄罗斯的这个光荣城市。从军舰下来的数千名海军战士，曾进行了登陆作战而给予侵略者以重大损伤。黑海舰队的英雄——海军战士们，如菲里庆柯夫、茨布里科、克拉斯诺谢尔斯基以及许多其他悉瓦斯托波尔的英勇保卫者们的名字，是永远留在人民的记忆里的。斯大林同志于一九四二年在其致悉瓦斯托波尔保卫者的祝词中曾指出：“悉瓦斯托波尔英雄们奋不顾身的斗争是全体红军和苏联人民的英雄主义的榜样”。
    在伟大卫国战争的年月里，海军给予敌人巨大损失，击沉了数千艘敌人的军舰、运输舰和潜水舰。
    党和政府崇高地估价了海军军人在为争取社会主义祖国的自由与独立的斗争中所表现的功绩。海军军人有五百一十三名荣获了苏联英雄称号。由于在伟大卫国战争中的战功，政府曾赠给海军军人们三十五万多枚勋章和奖章。
    劳动人民的领袖和朋友斯大林同志的衷心言语，是对海军军人最高的褒奖：
    “苏联海军军人在战斗中表现了无上的坚定和勇敢，高度的战斗积极性与军事技巧。潜水艇和军舰上的海员，海军飞机师、炮手与陆战步兵，都承受并发挥了俄国海军历来的一切宝贵传统。在波罗的海、黑海和巴伦支海，在伏尔加河、多瑙河和第聂伯河，苏联海军将士际此四年战争期间，在俄国海军光荣史册上留下了崭新的篇页。海军彻底完成了自己对苏维埃祖国所负的天职。”
    苏联人民和自己军队的友谊是牢不可破的。在战争的严酷年月里，劳动人民为了供给亲爱的陆、海、空军抗击敌人的一切必需物资曾不惜所有的力量。前线和后方的统一，全民对于祖国保卫者需用上的不断关怀，这是保证苏联对德国法西斯主义和日本帝国主义获得具有世界历史意义胜利的决定性因素之一。
    在建造军舰上，苏联人民所捐献的资金是源源不绝的。由一九四三年到战争结束的这个时期内，用苏联爱国者的自愿捐款曾建造了一百五十艘战舰。
    战争胜利结束后，苏联人民乃以加倍力量开始了和平的创造性劳动，并在建设共产主义伟大事业中取得了辉煌胜利。
    祖国把保卫苏联海防和交通线的任务，托付给光荣的海军，它正警惕地保卫着祖国而不使敌人侵犯。
    苏联人民正为强化苏联海军战斗威力奋不顾身地工作着。许多新的造船厂业已开工，正在顺利地建造军舰。苏联工业用最完善的技术来装备海军。造船工业的工人、工程师和技术人员们，在为亲爱的海军的发展上表现了斯达哈诺夫式劳动的崇高典范。
    苏联劳动人民在建设共产主义的新的光辉胜利中，在和平的创造性劳动中，来迎接全民的庆祝节日——海军节。伟大的苏联正毫不动摇地捍卫着全世界的和平与安全。准备给予战争贩子以坚决反击的全世界数千百万的普通人们正越来越紧密地团结在伟大的和平旗手——苏联的周围。
