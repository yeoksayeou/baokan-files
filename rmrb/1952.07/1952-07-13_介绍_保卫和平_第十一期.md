Introducing "Defend Peace" Issue 11

The eleventh issue of "Defend Peace" focuses on opposing germ warfare and publishes several important articles. Pierre Cot, president of the magazine, pointed out in the editorial "We Are All Threatened": "Germ warfare is a terrible thing, and it constitutes an extremely evil crime against humanity. The use of bacteriological weapons is not only a violation of international law, but also a violation of all moral codes, and no excuse can be found for it." This issue contains two pieces of information about the United States preparing for germ warfare. Among them, the article "The Weapons of Future War are Plague and Famine" is excerpted from an open article in the American "Life" magazine on November 18, 1946, that studied what weapons would be used in future wars. Another article, "Vannevar Bush - Head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development Advocates Poison Warfare," briefly describes the content of a book published by this "scientist" in 1949. This head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development publicly advocated long ago that moral concepts should not be considered, but only what is the best way to destroy life and eliminate mankind. The article "How Japan Prepared for Germ Warfare" is an excerpt from the confessions of the criminals Kiyoshi Kawashima and Toshihide Nishi during the trial of germ warfare criminals by the Soviet Military Tribunal in Khabarovsk in 1949. Mrs. Felton wrote an article entitled "New Disaster Strikes Korea." The author participated in the International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team and witnessed the war in Korea. In this short article, she made a powerful accusation against the crimes of US imperialism in carrying out germ warfare.

In addition, this issue also publishes many articles discussing disarmament issues, international trade issues, and reporting on cultural life and children's life in various countries.

    介绍“保卫和平”第十一期
    “保卫和平”杂志第十一期以反对细菌战为中心，发表了几篇重要的文章。该杂志社社长皮尔·戈特在社论“我们全都受到威胁”中指出：“细菌战是骇人听闻的一件事，它构成了一个对人类犯下的极恶的罪行。使用细菌武器，不仅是违反国际公法，而且是违反一切道德的规条，无论怎样都不能替它找到饶恕的理由。”本期刊有两篇关于美国准备进行细菌战的资料。其中“未来战争的武器是鼠疫与饥荒”一文，是摘自美国“生活”杂志一九四六年十一月十八日的一篇公开研究未来战争用什么武器的文章。另外一篇“范纳法·布希——美国国防研究处处长主张毒物战争”，简述了这位“科学家”在一九四九年发表的一本著作的内容。这个美国的国防研究处处长，早就公开主张不该顾虑道德观念，而只考虑用什么最好的方法来毁灭生命、消灭人类。“日本怎样准备细菌战争的”一文，摘录了一九四九年苏联伯力军事法庭审讯细菌战犯时，罪犯川岛清、西俊英的几段供状。费尔顿夫人写了“新的灾难侵袭朝鲜”一文。作者曾参加国际民主妇联的调查团，亲眼看见了朝鲜的战争。她在这篇短文中对美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行提出了有力的控诉。
    另外，本期还刊载有讨论裁军问题、国际贸易问题和报道各国文化生活、儿童生活等的文章多篇。
