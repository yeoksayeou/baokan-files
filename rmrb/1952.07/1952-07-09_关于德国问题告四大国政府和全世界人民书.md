    To the Governments of the Four Great Powers and the People of the World on the German Question
    Seven years have passed since the destruction of the Hitler regime, but a peace treaty with Germany has still not been concluded. The World Peace Council, representing the wishes of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, writes to the governments of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, because these four governments, according to the Potsdam Agreement, bear a special responsibility for the peaceful resolution of the German question. The World Peace Council informs them that now is the time to fully and jointly assume these responsibilities.
    The two treaties signed in Bonn and Paris on May 26 and 27 completely violate this obligation and unilaterally address this issue. These two agreements signify the revival of militarism and fascism, deepen the rift in Germany and Europe, and hinder any effective efforts to achieve universal disarmament.
    The people of all countries are well aware that the danger of war will arise if an agreement is not sought with firm determination through negotiations.
    The World Peace Council believes that the best decision is to immediately convene a conference of the four great powers to pass all decisions for a peaceful resolution of the German question. The World Peace Council believes that the best decision is to allow the German people themselves to independently realize their unification through free elections and to establish a government that will conclude a peace treaty with all countries that fought against Hitler's Germany.
    This treaty should recognize the sovereignty of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany.
    This treaty will stipulate the conditions for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces, and according to this treaty, Germany will guarantee not to join any military alliance. It will also help the people of Europe to decide their own destiny in security, cooperation, and respect for their independence.
    In addition to offering advice to the governments of the four great powers, the World Peace Council also speaks to the people of all countries. The World Peace Council expresses its respect for the great public opinion movement and various measures launched, regardless of national borders and ideological differences, to prevent the dangers that would be caused by the ratification and implementation of the Bonn and Paris agreements. The World Peace Council assures that it will support the vigilant and courageous people of any country, including Germany, who express their willingness to work together to repel this danger and hold their rulers, leaders, or parliamentarians responsible for ratifying these treaties.
    The World Peace Council solemnly declares that cooperation among the people of all countries is necessary to immediately launch effective action.
    The World Peace Council appeals to trade unions, parties, groups, and churches in all countries, especially Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Scandinavian countries, and Germany's neighboring countries; it appeals to the young generation whose future will be forever destroyed if war breaks out. It appeals to all those who know that danger is threatening the families of people all over the world; it appeals to all those who know that disaster is not inevitable and that the current serious situation requires everyone to firmly believe that the people have the ability to reach an agreement and the ability to find a common way of acting.
    If the people of all countries unite all their forces, they will be able to prevent the approval of separate agreements in the coming months, and they will be able to strive for a conference of the four great powers to obtain a peaceful resolution that is both conducive to their security and in line with the national interests of the German people.

    关于德国问题告四大国政府和全世界人民书
    摧毁希特勒政权已经七年，但是对德和约仍然没有缔结。世界和平理事会代表全世界千千万万人民的愿望，致书美国、法国、英国和苏联四大国政府，因为这四国政府根据波茨坦协定在和平解决德国问题方面承担了特别的责任。世界和平理事会告诉它们，现在是充分地、共同地担负起这些责任的时候了。
    五月二十六日和二十七日在波恩和巴黎签订的两个条约，完全违反这种义务，而片面地处理这个问题。这两个协定意味着军国主义和法西斯主义的复活，加深了德国和欧洲的裂缝，妨碍实现普遍裁减军备的任何有效的努力。
    各国人民都很清楚地知道，如果不以坚定的决心争取通过谈判取得协议，就会发生战争危险。
    世界和平理事会认为，最好的决定就是立即召开四大国会议，通过为了和平解决德国问题的一切决定。世界和平理事会认为，最好的决定就是让德国人民自己通过自由选举独立地实现他们的统一，并成立一个会和一切曾和希特勒德国作战的国家缔结和约的政府。
    这个条约应该承认统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国享有自主权。
    这个条约将规定外国占领军撤退的条件，而根据这个条约，德国将保证不参加任何军事联盟。它也将帮助欧洲各国人民使他们能够在安全、合作和尊重他们的独立的情况下，自己决定自己的命运。
    世界和平理事会除了向四大国政府提出意见之外，同时向各国人民讲话。世界和平理事会对于不分国界和思想信仰的差别、为防止批准和实施波恩和巴黎两协定所会造成的危险而展开的伟大的舆论运动和种种措施，表示敬意。世界和平理事会保证，对于无论那一个国家的警觉和勇敢的人民，连德国的在内，凡是表示愿意共同努力打退这种危险，向他们的负责批准这些条约的统治者、领袖或议员们追究责任的人，它都予以支持。
    世界和平理事会庄严地宣告，为了立即展开有效的行动，各国人民之间的合作是必要的。
    世界和平理事会向各国，特别是德国、英国、法国、意大利、斯堪的纳维亚各国以及德国各邻国的工会、党派、团体和教会呼吁；向如果发生战争，前途就永远毁灭的年青的一代呼吁。它向所有那些知道危险正威胁着全世界人民的家庭的人们呼吁；它向所有那些知道灾难并不是不可避免、而目前严重的局面须要大家坚决相信人民有能力取得协议、有能力找到共同行动方式的人们呼吁。
    各国人民只要团结起他们的一切力量，他们在今后几个月就能够阻止单独协定获得批准，就能够争取到召开四大国会议，以获得既利于他们的安全又符合德国人民民族利益的和平解决。
