    The Sales Competition Campaign in the State-Owned Trade Sector of Northeast China
    Chen Xin
    The state-owned trade sector of Northeast China, responding to the call of Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government to strive to complete 43% of the annual sales plan in the second quarter, universally launched a sales competition campaign. Under the correct leadership of the Party committees and governments at all levels in Northeast China, coupled with the efforts of all employees, the entire region completed the semi-annual sales task five days ahead of schedule. On this basis, a comprehensive patriotic production increase and economy campaign is now being prepared to strive to overfulfill the annual sales plan.
    The sales campaign, centered on promoting industrial products and focusing on the department store and industrial equipment systems, has achieved multifaceted results.
    First, it greatly enhanced the patriotic sales enthusiasm of employees and strengthened the connection between state-owned trade and the people. All companies, stores, groups, and individuals participating in the competition, with the help of the Party committees, trade unions, and Communist Youth League, exhausted all means to formulate work plans for expanding sales, overcoming the ideas of "selling whatever is given," "waiting for customers to come," and only selling "famous brands." For example, the Fuxin County Department Store in Liaoxi Province processed imported "sole leather" into comfortable shoes, and the Qinggang County Department Store in Heilongjiang Province processed overstocked fabrics that had been unsalable for more than a year into clothing, which quickly sold out. In the Jinzhou area, bicycle sales in just over ten days were eleven times the sales plan. The entire staff of the Fengcheng County Department Store, under the slogans of "four quicks" (quick procurement, quick warehousing, quick pricing, quick sales), "five goods" (good publicity, good attitude, good connection with cooperatives, good product display, good hygiene), and "three no-loses" (no losing money, no losing goods, no losing customers), each took the time to go out and sell goods with samples, selling more than 4,000 pairs of rubber shoes in five days. The staff of the Dalai County Department Store even proposed the "Five Threes System," namely three quicks (quick to speak, quick to get goods, quick to settle accounts), three necessities (necessity of publicity, necessity of amiability, necessity of explanation), three familiarities (familiar with prices, familiar with specifications, familiar with performance), three diligences (diligent cleaning, diligent arrangement, diligent stocktaking), and three no-loses (no losing money, no losing goods, no losing customers). These new creations expanded sales, improved the credibility of state-owned trade, and greatly strengthened the connection between state-owned trade and the people. For example, the Lindian County People's Congress, which had previously made more than 20 criticisms of the store clerks' work style, now greatly praised their attitude; citizens of Qiqihar reflected: "The work style of the clerks has improved!" Citizens of Shenyang reflected: "The work style of the clerks has improved."
    Secondly, it expanded sales volume, accelerated the completion of the sales plan, and strengthened the leading role of state-owned trade in the free market. In the second quarter, up to June 10, a total of 70 days (hereinafter the same), the sales volume of the entire region increased by 9.2% compared with the first quarter of 90 days, and more than doubled compared with the second quarter of last year. The sales volume of some major commodities (such as rubber shoes and bicycles) exceeded the original plan by about ten times.
    Thirdly, it strengthened the relationship between state-owned trade and people's cooperative undertakings. In the campaign, comrades in state-owned trade further realized that expanding wholesale to cooperatives meant doing a good job in fully supplying consumers and helping with the collectivization of agriculture, so they actively supported cooperatives. State-owned trade throughout the region, from top to bottom, has generally established a weekly joint office system with cooperatives, implemented the rational distribution of goods, promptly resolved problems, further coordinated their plans, unified steps, and jointly completed tasks. Wholesale stations in various regions and many county department stores have overcome departmentalism and purely profit-oriented views, and have established sample rooms for cooperatives, inviting cooperative directors and grassroots business personnel to visit, signing supply contracts, and increasing the variety and volume of cooperative operations. The turnover of cooperatives in the entire region in early June increased by 3.46 times compared with early April.
    Fourthly, it promoted advanced experiences and improved sales methods. Some advanced experiences that began in Shenyang City, such as establishing a specialized warehouse that is "orderly, quick in and quick out, with accurate matching of goods and accounts." The experience of combining warehouse rectification to improve allocation and shorten the time of commodity circulation with the sale of goods, convening representative meetings of business personnel from subordinate grassroots units (and inviting grassroots business personnel from cooperatives to participate) (representatives of custodians, allocators, purchasers, salespersons, accountants, etc.) to organize visits to warehouses, familiarize themselves with sources of goods, strengthen contacts, and combine with each other to expand sales, the experience of adopting a delivery system for retail companies and cooperatives to reduce their difficulties in picking up and transporting goods, the experience of developing retail stores and specialized wholesale departments based on the distribution of residents, cooperatives and private merchants, etc., have been promoted throughout Northeast China, especially in major and medium-sized cities. The Northeast Industrial Equipment Company has also promoted the method of holding symposiums for production units to fix unit users and implement long-term supply contracts; in addition, it has established specialized stores (such as chemical, transportation, etc. stores), and has launched a campaign to eliminate unpriced commodities and review price tags by going deep into the site to correctly and timely price them.
    These experiences have also been unfolded in the department store system. The method implemented by the Qiqihar Department Store of collecting goods separately for institutions, groups, troops, schools, and factories and mines, as well as other experiences in guiding people's consumption, have also been unfolded throughout the region. The promotion of advanced experience has expanded sales, making sales adapt to the needs of production and consumers.
    The following main experiences were gained in organizing sales competitions in various places:
    1. The Party committee and government's emphasis on leadership, constantly strengthening the leadership and inspection of the competition campaign, and promptly correcting the problems that occur in the campaign, is the decisive key to ensuring the normal and in-depth development of the campaign. The Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government organized five inspection teams, including ministers, deputy ministers, directors, and managers of specialized regional companies, to go to various provinces and cities in rotation to inspect work. After correcting the phenomena of insufficient combination of the "Three-Anti's" and business, insufficient combination of state-owned trade enterprises and cooperatives, and chaotic warehouse management, it played a positive role in rapidly launching the competition campaign to promote industrial products. Units at all levels in Heilongjiang Province established production increase and economy competition committees. The Provincial Planning Commission and the Commerce Department constantly sent capable cadres to various places to inspect. The competition campaign formed a broad mass movement throughout the province. On the contrary, in the early stages of the competition campaign, the leading organs of Songjiang Province were unable to spare manpower due to the "Three-Anti's," so the development of the competition campaign was extremely unbalanced. Later, a large number of cadres were organized to go to various places to inspect. Deputy Chairman Rao Bin of the Provincial People's Government also personally made arrangements, and Deputy Director Guan Zhou went to the warehouse to guide allocation. Only then did the province's competition campaign begin, and the sales volume increased day by day. For example, the daily average sales volume in the first half of June increased by 107.7% compared with the daily average sales volume in April, leaping from the worst sales performance among the state-owned trade sales in the Northeast provinces to the unit with the fastest rate of increase.
    2. Strengthening political and ideological education and promoting a democratic work style is another important link in consolidating and improving competitive morale. For example, the leaders of the Xinbin County Department Store in Liaodong Province regularly reported their work to the Party committee and the government and requested instructions. The Party committee and the government also frequently carried out ideological education for employees, coupled with the active cooperation of the Party branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, going deep among the masses to mobilize employees to think of ways, so that everyone could formulate specific sales plans, enabling the company to overfulfill its tasks month by month from January to May, completing the semi-annual plan 25 days ahead of schedule.
    3. Focusing on key points, gaining experience, and universally promoting it will enable the competition campaign to develop comprehensively and create a craze. Heilongjiang Province organized a sales competition focusing on four commodities: bicycles, rubber shoes, mao shrimp, and salted fish, which not only opened up the sales channels for these four commodities, but also promoted the entire sales campaign. The Lishu County Department Store in Liaoxi Province combined spring plowing and production, strengthened publicity work to promote rubber shoes, gained successful experience, and quickly applied this experience to the promotion of major commodities such as glass, gunny sacks, matches, and kerosene. Other examples, such as the cultivation of typical groups in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, and the timely commendation and rewards for those who created advanced experiences in the Dandong City Department Store, Liaodong Province, have promoted all employees (including odd-jobbers) to be involved in the competition craze.
    4. Based on the needs of sales work, strengthening internal contacts, accurately organizing sources of goods, and closely coordinating all links is an important issue in expanding sales. The Qiqihar City Department Store organized sales team leaders to visit the warehouse. Everyone knew that the inventory and backlog of fast-selling materials were very abundant, which increased the enthusiasm for selling goods. They immediately requested more than 300 kinds of goods, more than ten times the usual request. The goods receiving staff of Zhaozhou Department Store exposed the problems of the Harbin Wholesale Station's slow allocation, slow action, and inconsistent goods and accounts, which also played a certain role in improving allocation and promoting work. In addition, organizing the goods receiving staff to promptly reflect the requirements of the business department to the purchasing department is also a method to accurately grasp the source of materials. All departments of the Shenyang Industrial Equipment Company carried out competitions around expanding sales. The warehouse implemented a "one-time inventory system," reversing the negative "look at the pile thinking" of the custodians, shortening the commodity circulation time by two-fifths, so that the goods displayed in the store increased from 1,500 in the first quarter to 8,000 in the second quarter; price workers went deep into the site, contacted all parties and looked for reference materials, and promptly solved the backlog of more than 300 kinds of unpriced commodities. Experience has proven that if purchasing, processing, pricing, transportation, accounting, planning, and other connections are not good and cannot keep up with sales requirements, the commodity circulation plan cannot be guaranteed to be completed.
    5. The competition campaign must be combined with improving labor organization, improving work efficiency, giving full play to potential capabilities, and paying attention to employee welfare. The Nehe County Department Store in Heilongjiang Province rationally redivided the sales team, reduced the workload of clerks in filling out five-day tables and making ten-day reports, clearly stipulated the scope of work of clerks, and overcame the phenomenon that the daily working hours were as long as 14 hours in the past (now it is 9 and a half hours), and changed from three fears (fearing holidays, fearing wrong accounts, wrong goods, fearing many buyers) to three expectations (expecting sunny days, expecting weeks, expecting more sales). The Shenyang City Department Store No. 1 implemented a two-shift system, the joint-venture company implemented a rotation system, and some food and groceries adopted the method of pre-packaging and issuing invoices in advance to shorten transaction time and facilitate customers. The average sales volume increased by 20% to 30%, and the circulation cost only increased by about 10% (mostly used for salaries and office expenses). The Dalian City Department Store adjusted the counter area of different commodities according to the season, striving to balance the efficiency of the counter in accommodating customers. The Yian County Store in Heilongjiang Province changed the counter for selling paper, so that clerks no longer felt back pain and dizziness due to bending over to count paper. However, some places have not done enough in improving employee welfare and need to work hard to improve.
    Now, the Northeast first-level trade agencies are conducting in-depth inspection work, summarizing advanced experience, strengthening political work, and implementing rewards to continue to promote this movement. On this basis, state-owned trade enterprises in various places are discussing and formulating production increase and economy plans in order to quickly and comprehensively develop the competition campaign to increase production and save 2.4 million tons of grain.

    东北国营贸易部门的销货竞赛运动
    陈新
    东北国营贸易部门，响应东北人民政府高岗主席号召，为争取第二季度完成全年销售计划的百分之四十三，曾经普遍开展了一次销货竞赛运动。在东北各级党委和政府的正确领导下，加上全体职工的努力，全区已经提前五天完成了半年推销任务。在此基础上，现正酝酿着全面进行爱国主义增产节约竞赛运动，争取超额完成全年销售计划。
    以推销工业品为中心和以百货、工业器材系统为重点的销货运动，获得的成绩是多方面的。
    首先是大大提高了职工的爱国销售热情，密切了国营贸易与人民群众的联系。所有参加竞赛的公司、商店、小组和个人，在党委、工会、青年团的帮助下，都想尽办法，制订了扩大销售的工作计划，克服了“给啥卖啥”、“等买主上门”、以及只销“名牌货”的思想。例如辽西省阜新县百货公司将进口“底皮”加工成便鞋，黑龙江省青冈县百货公司将积压了年余的滞销布匹加工成衣服，都很快就卖光了。锦州地区十几天里卖的自行车，等于销售计划的十一倍。凤城县百货公司全体职工在四快（快要货、快出库、快作价、快推销）、五好（宣传好、态度好、联系合作社好、商品陈列好、卫生好）、三不丢（不丢钱、不丢货、不丢买主）的口号下，每个人都抽空带着货样子去卖货，五天内卖出胶鞋四千余双。大赉县百货公司店员更提出“五三制”的口号，即三快（快说话、快拿货、快算账）、三要（要宣传、要和霭、要解释）、三熟（熟价格、熟规格、熟性能）、三勤（勤打扫、勤布置、勤点货）、三不丢（不丢钱、不丢货、不丢买主）。这些新的创造，扩大了推销，提高了国营贸易的信誉，也使国营贸易与人民群众的联系大大增强。如林甸县人民代表会，过去曾对店员作风提出二十几条批评意见，现在则对店员态度大加称赞；齐齐哈尔市民反映：“店员作风转好啦！”沈阳市民反映：“店员作风有改进。”
    其次是扩大了卖钱额，加速了完成卖钱计划的速度，加强了国营贸易对自由市场的领导作用。第二季度截止六月十日共七十天（下同），全区卖钱比第一季度九十天增加百分之九点二，比去年第二季度增加一倍多，有些主要商品（如胶鞋、自行车）的销货量有超过原计划十倍左右的。
    第三是密切了国营贸易与人民合作事业的关系。国营贸易的同志在运动中进一步认识了扩大对合作社的批发，就是作好对消费群众的充分供应，和帮助农民合作化，因此积极扶助合作社。全区国营贸易自上而下比较普遍地与合作社建立了每周联合办公制度，实行商品合理分配，及时解决发生的问题，进一步衔接彼此计划，统一步调，共同完成任务。各地区批发站和不少县的百货公司都克服了本位主义思想和单纯盈利观点，并为合作社建立样品室，邀请合作社主任及基层业务人员参观，签订供应合同，增加了合作社的经营品种和经营量。全区合作社六月上旬的营业额比四月上旬增加了三点四六倍。
    第四是推广了先进经验，改进了推销方法。从沈阳市开始实行的一些先进经验，例如建立“有条有理、进快出快、货账相符”的专门仓库。以改进调拨、缩短商品流转时间的整顿仓库和销售商品相结合的经验，召开所属基层单位（并聘请合作社基层业务人员参加）业务人员代表会议（保管、调拨、采购、营业、会计等人员的代表）组织参观仓库、熟悉货源、加强联系，互相结合来扩大推销的经验，对零售公司和合作社采取送货制以减少其取货和运输困难的经验，依据居民及合作社和私商分布状况发展零售商店和专业批发部的经验等等，已在东北全区，特别是各大、中城市推广。东北工业器材公司还推行了召开生产单位座谈会的方法，以固定单位用户，实行长期供应合同；另外还建立了专业化商店（如化工、交通等商店），与深入现场正确及时作价，展开消灭无牌价商品和复查牌价的运动。
    这些经验也在百货公司系统展开。齐齐哈尔百货公司实行的对机关、团体、部队、学校、厂矿分别汇货的办法，以及其他指导人民消费的经验，也在全区展开。先进经验的推广，扩大了销售，使销售适应于生产与消费者的需要。
    各地在组织推销竞赛中，获得了下列主要经验：
    一、党委和政府领导重视，经常加强对竞赛运动的领导和检查，及时纠正运动中发生的问题，是保证运动正常深入发展的决定关键。东北人民政府贸易部组织了包括正、副部长、处长、专业区公司经理在内的五个检查小组分赴各省市轮回检查工作，纠正了“三反”与业务结合不够、国营贸易企业与合作社结合不够、和仓库管理混乱的现象以后，对迅速开展推销工业品竞赛运动，起了积极的推动作用。黑龙江省各级单位成立了增产节约竞赛委员会，省计划委员会和商业厅不断派得力干部到各地检查，竞赛运动在全省范围内形成广泛群众性的运动。相反，松江省领导机关在开展竞赛运动初期，由于“三反”抽不出人手来，竞赛运动发展就极不平衡。后来组织大批干部分赴各地检查，省人民政府饶斌副主席也亲自布置，关舟副厅长亲往仓库指导调拨后，全省的竞赛运动才开展起来，卖钱额日日增长，如六月上半月每日平均卖钱额，比四月份每日平均卖钱额增长了百分之一○七点七，由东北各省国营贸易卖钱情况最差的地位，而跃进为上升速度最快的单位。
    二、加强政治思想教育，发扬民主作风，是巩固并提高竞赛情绪的另一个重要环节。如辽东省新宾县百货公司领导上经常按时向党委与政府汇报工作，请求指示。党委和政府也经常对职工进行思想教育，加以党支部、行政、工会、青年团的积极配合，深入群众发动职工想办法，使人人订出具体推销计划，使该公司从一月至五月份月月超额完成任务，上半年计划提前二十五天完成。
    三、抓着重点，取得经验，普遍推行，使竞赛运动全面发展，造成热潮。黑龙江省以自行车、胶鞋、毛虾、咸鱼四种商品为重点，组织推销竞赛，不但打开这四种商品的销路，而且推动了整个销货运动。辽西省梨树县百货公司结合春耕生产，加强宣传工作以推销胶鞋，取得成功经验，并很快把这一经验运用到推销玻璃、麻袋、火柴、煤油等主要商品上来。其他如黑龙江省讷河县培养典型小组、辽东省安东市百货公司对创造先进经验者进行及时表扬及奖励等，都推动全体职工（包括勤杂人员在内）卷入竞赛的热潮。
    四、根据推销工作需要，密切内部联系，准确组织货源，各个环节密切配合好，是扩大卖钱的一个重要问题。齐齐哈尔市百货公司组织销货组长参观仓库，大家知道库存和积压畅销物资很丰富，提高了卖货积极性，即刻要了三百多种货，超过平时要货十倍。肇州百货公司领货员揭发哈尔滨批发站分拨太慢、行动迟缓、货账不符等毛病，对改进调拨、推动工作也起了一定作用；此外，组织领货员及时向采购部门反映营业部门的要求，也是便于准确掌握物资来源的一项办法。沈阳市工业器材公司各个部门都围绕着扩大卖钱额来开展竞赛，仓库实行“一次清点制”，扭转保管员消极“看堆思想”，缩短商品流转五分之二的时间，使商店摆出的商品由第一季度一千五百种增加到第二季度的八千种；物价工作者深入现场，向各方面联系及找参考资料，及时解决了三百余种无价商品的积压。经验证明：采购、加工、作价、运输、会计、计划等联系不好，跟不上卖货要求，就不能保证商品流转计划完成。
    五、竞赛运动必须与改进劳动组织，提高工作效率，充分发挥潜在能力，注意职工福利相结合。黑龙江省讷河县百货公司合理地重新划分了卖货小组，减少店员填写五日表、做旬报等项工作的工作量，明确规定了店员工作范围，克服了以往每日劳动时间长达十四小时的现象（现在为九小时半），由三怕（怕假日，怕错账、错货，怕买主多）转变为三盼（盼晴天、盼星期、盼卖钱多），沈阳市百货第一商店实行两班制，联营公司实行轮休制，若干食品和杂货采取先行包好、开好发票，以缩短交易时间，便利顾客的办法，平均卖钱额增加百分之二十至三十，流转费仅增加百分之十左右（大部用在薪金及办公费上）。旅大市百货公司按季节调整不同商品的柜台面积，力求平衡柜台容纳顾客效率。黑龙江省依安县商店改变了卖纸张的货台，使店员不再因弯腰点纸而感背痛头昏。不过，对于改善职工福利的工作，有些地方还做得不够好，尚需努力改进。
    现在，东北一级贸易机关正在深入检查工作，总结先进经验，加强政治工作，实行奖励，以继续推动这一运动。在此基础上，各地国营贸易企业正在讨论和制订增产节约计划，以便迅速全面开发增产节约二百四十万吨粮食的竞赛运动。
