Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Hungarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement
Aierna Mihaifei, Deputy Minister of Culture of Hungary and Secretary-General of the Hungarian Peace Protection Committee

    Today is the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Hungarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement. One year ago today, representatives of the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic signed this agreement, marking the official beginning of cultural exchange between the two peoples, at a grand ceremony in Beijing.

    The richness of this agreement is most clearly demonstrated in the achievements of the past year. These achievements are something we can be satisfied with.

    For many centuries, Europeans have regarded China as a very distant and exotic country. When the Hungarian government delegation arrived in China a year ago, their first clear impression was that it was very out of date to regard China as a very distant and exotic country. Geographically, it is not that far away: a scheduled flight from Budapest to Beijing takes only four days. The great people of this powerful country, together with their post-liberation life, goals, ideals, and amazing achievements, are very close to us. Politically speaking, there is virtually no distance between our two countries. We demand the same things, we are engaged in the same construction, we strive for the same goals, and we fight side by side in the peace camp. The great socialist country of the Soviet Union is our common neighbor, helper, friend, and model.

    From Budapest to Beijing, we flew ten thousand kilometers over a beautiful, free, and peaceful country. In that country, everything expresses peace, everywhere you can see peaceful construction and grand peace plans, and everything demonstrates an invincible force for peace.

    A year ago, we only stayed in China for a few weeks. Naturally, a few weeks is too short to thoroughly understand such a large country and its strong people. But even in this short time, we came into contact with some special things that could explain our knowledge from books, and saw some real materials that could supplement our theoretical knowledge; we also personally experienced the economic, social, and political development of the Chinese people, which has a decisive significance in world history.

    The fact that some people who had bravely participated in the "Long March" were respected by everyone in their work posts reminded us of the wonderful epics we had read in the works of Chinese writers and poets. When we visited the village office of a village, a peasant woman was allowed to sit in the seat of honor because her son was fighting in Korea as a member of the volunteer army. Her proud and happy smile reflected the feelings of the entire Chinese people towards the Chinese People's Volunteers who were fighting against the American aggressors.

    In Beijing, we didn't need to hunt for "experiences." We only had to walk around the streets, shops, and factories with our eyes open to see the real signs of the economic improvement that was improving the lives of the people across the country day by day, the upsurge of the cultural revolution, and the signs of the decisive struggle and revolutionary forces to defeat all enemies. We always had the feeling that we had grasped the history that was just being created, and that every minute we spent in China was history itself.

    A year ago, the representatives of our delegation had the opportunity to see for themselves what force led the revolution of the 500 million Chinese people to victory, mobilized them, and continued to build their country—that is, the Communist Party of China and its close relationship with the people, and the unlimited enthusiasm and determination of the masses united around the Party. Our participation in the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China was an unforgettable experience for us.

    The plans implemented in the first year of the Sino-Hungarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement prove how true our first impression was—that China is neither far nor strange. What happened this year?

    The Chinese Art Troupe, consisting of more than 200 people, visited Hungary and gave wonderful performances in Budapest and other cities. They performed the opera "The White-Haired Girl," presenting to the audience the terrible oppression suffered by Chinese peasants before liberation and their victorious liberation, allowing the Hungarian people to recognize how excellently the new Chinese art serves political progress and the education of the people. The music, dance, and skits of the new China also demonstrated this point. We saw how fresh and how adapted to the times Chinese art is, and how sharply it deals with the most timely current issues. This has provided our writers and artists with important lessons and great examples.

    The Chinese Art Troupe performed the world-famous Chinese acrobatics in Hungary. The astonishing perfection of their skills also won the genuine admiration of the Hungarian audience.

    The "Chinese Film Week" held in Budapest and throughout Hungary was a major event in the first year of cultural exchange between our two countries, giving millions of Hungarian people the opportunity to watch several outstanding works of Chinese film art.

    This year, many new books about China have appeared in Hungary, including Ding Ling's novel, which won the Stalin Prize, and a historical work about the glorious fighting history of the Chinese Communist Party for thirty years.

    During this year, the visits and lectures of Chinese scientists have allowed the Hungarian people to more closely appreciate the culture of the Chinese people after liberation.

    During this period, several delegations went to China from Hungary, including the Secretary-General of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League, the President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, representatives of the Hungarian Peace Protection Committee, the Hungarian National Federation of Trade Unions, representatives of the Labor Youth League, and the Secretary-General of the Hungarian Writers' Association. After returning to their country, they reported on their experiences in a series of lectures, enabling the Hungarian people to understand the great achievements of the Chinese people.

    In recent weeks, we have happily read daily reports about the visit of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe to China. We have felt the love of the Chinese people for the children of Hungary, and we know that every minute the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe spends in China demonstrates the fraternal unity of the two peoples.

    When we experience this sincere friendship of the great Chinese people, when we think that all the distances between our two countries are bridged, and that we are coming closer together in the powerful and victorious peace camp, we are deeply moved. We have learned, and will continue to learn, a great deal from the struggles, victories, and achievements of the Chinese people. In the new Chinese art and culture, which is based on thousands of years of cultural traditions, there are many things that we should also learn well. This art and culture faithfully reflects the Chinese people's strong hatred of imperialism and their firm and united struggle for peace.

    纪念中匈文化合作协定签订一周年
    匈牙利文化部副部长
    匈牙利保卫和平委员会总书记  埃尔纳·米哈依费
    今天是中匈文化合作协定缔结一周年。一年前的今日，中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国政府的代表在北京的一个隆重典礼中签订了这一个标志着两国人民文化交流正式开始的协定。
    这个协定包罗了何等丰富的内容，在过去一年的成绩中最清楚地表现出来。这个成绩是使我们称心满意的。
    许多世纪以来，欧洲人曾经把中国看做一个很远很远的奇异的国家。当一年前匈牙利政府代表团到达中国的时候，他们第一个明确的印象就是：再把中国看做一个很远很远的奇异的国家，那就觉得十分悖时了。在地理上也并不相隔很远：从布达佩斯乘飞机照班次只要四天便可以到北京。这个强盛国家的伟大人民连同他们在解放后的生活、目标、理想以及惊人的成就，对于我们是十分接近的。说到政治方面，我们两国之间简直毫无距离的。我们所要求的相同，我们进行着同样的建设，我们争取着一致的目标，我们在和平阵营中并肩地战斗着。伟大的社会主义国家苏联是我们共同的邻国、帮手、朋友和模范。
    从布达佩斯到北京，我们在一个美丽的、自由的和平国家的上空飞行了一万公里。在那个国家里，一切事物都表现着和平，到处看得到和平建设和宏伟的和平计划，一切都发挥着不可战胜的和平力量。
    一年前我们在中国只逗留了几个星期。自然要彻底了解这样一个大国及其强盛的人民，几个星期是太短促了。但是就在这短促的时间里，我们也接触到一些特殊的事物可以说明我们从书中得来的知识，看到一些真实的材料可以补充我们的理论知识；多少也亲自体验到在世界历史上有决定性意义的中国人民经济、社会和政治的发展情况。
    一些曾经英勇地参加过“长征”的人们在他们工作岗位上受到大家敬重的情况，使我们重想到我们从中国作家和诗人的作品上曾经读过的那种美妙的史诗。当我们访问一个村庄的村公所的时候，一位农妇被让坐在首席，因为她的儿子参加了志愿军在朝鲜作战。她那骄傲和快乐的微笑，反映出全体中国人民对于打击美国侵略者的中国人民志愿军的情谊。
    我们在北京无须猎取“经历”，我们只要张着眼睛在街上、在商店和工厂中走走，就看得到那一种使全国人民生活一天天改善的经济的真实标志，看得到文化革命的热潮，看得到战胜一切敌人的决定性斗争和革命力量的标志。我们始终有着这样的一种的感想，我们已经抓住了刚在创造的历史，我们在中国过度着的每一分钟都是历史本身。
    一年前，我们代表团的代表们有机会亲自看到是什么力量把五万万中国人民的革命领导到胜利，把他们发动起来，继续建设他们的国家——这就是中国共产党和它与人民的密切关系，以及团结在党周围的群众的无限热情和决心。我们参加过中国共产党成立三十周年的庆祝大会，这对于我们是一个难忘的经历。
    中匈文化合作协定的第一年所实施的计划，证明我们第一个印象——中国并不远，也不奇异——是如何的真确呵。这一年有些什么事情呢？
    两百多人所组成的中国文工团访问了匈牙利，在布达佩斯及其他城市作了美好的表演。他们上演了歌剧“白毛女”，把解放前中国农民所受到的可怖的压迫以及他们获得胜利解放的景象，呈现到观众的眼前，使匈牙利人民认识了新中国艺术如何出色地服务于政治的前进与人民的教育。新中国的音乐、舞蹈和短剧同样表现了这一点。我们看到中国艺术多么新鲜，多么适应时代，它把最有时间性的时事问题处理得又多么尖锐。这给我国的作家和艺术家们提供了重要的教训和伟大的范例。
    中国文工团在匈牙利表演了世界闻名的中国杂技。他们的演技的惊人的完美也赢得了匈牙利观众的真正赞赏。
    在布达佩斯和匈牙利全国各地所举行的“中国电影周”，是我们两国文化交流第一年中的一件大事，它使好多万匈牙利人民有机会观赏中国电影艺术的几部杰出的作品。
    这一年中有不少关于中国的新书在匈牙利出现，其中有一本获得斯大林奖金的丁玲的小说和一本关于中国共产党光荣战斗三十年的历史著作。
    在这一年中，中国科学家们的访问和演讲使匈牙利人民更密切地领略到解放后的中国人民的文化。
    在这时期中间，有几个代表团从匈牙利到中国去，其中有匈牙利民主妇女联盟总书记、匈牙利科学院院长、匈牙利保卫和平委员会代表、匈牙利全国总工会代表团、劳动青年联盟代表、匈牙利作家协会秘书长等。他们回国后，在一系列的讲演会上报告了他们的经历，使匈牙利人民群众认识到中国人民的伟大成就。
    在最近的几星期中，我们每天都幸福地读到关于匈牙利国家人民文工团访问中国的报道，我们感觉到中国人民对匈牙利的儿女们的热爱，我们知道匈牙利国家人民文工团在中国度过的每一分钟，都表现了两国人民兄弟般的团结。
    当我们体会到伟大中国人民的这种真诚的友情的时候，当我们想到我们两国之间的一切距离都有桥梁可通，而我们又在强大的胜利的和平阵营中靠拢在一起的时候，我们是深深感动的。从中国人民的斗争，胜利和成就中，我们学习过，而且还要学习的东西非常多。以几千年文化传统为基础的中国新艺术与文化中间，有不少东西也是我们要好好学习的，这种艺术与文化忠实地反映着中国人民对帝国主义的强烈的仇恨，和他们坚决一致地争取和平的斗争。
