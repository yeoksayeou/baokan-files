    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Just as the U.S. government is doing its utmost to deny its crime of conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China, an American magazine has once again revealed that the U.S. government is massively engaged in the artificial cultivation of bacteria in order to continue its barbaric bacteriological warfare. According to an AFP dispatch from Washington on the 14th: The U.S. "Look" magazine said in its issue published on the 14th that at least five U.S. government agencies are engaged in the artificial cultivation of bacteria. "Look" magazine said that these five agencies are: the Army Chemical Corps, the Public Health Service, the Department of Agriculture, the Army Medical Service, and the Navy Medical Service. The magazine said that the U.S. plan is to "cultivate new bacteria that are more toxic than those found in nature" and to "perfect methods of disseminating new bacteria." The magazine also unscrupulously advocated bacteriological warfare against China and the Soviet Union.
    While the American aggressors are conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare against Korea and Northeast China, refusing to condemn the use of bacteriological weapons and refusing to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons, they are shouting "humanitarianism" and trying every possible means to deny their monstrous crime of conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China. Now, the American ruling group's own magazine has once again exposed the bloody face of the American aggressors. The American aggressors not only regard the "Army Chemical Corps," the "Army Medical Service," and the "Navy Medical Service" as institutions for carrying out bacteriological warfare; but also turn the "Public Health Service" into a bloody organ engaged in slaughtering the people of other countries, and the "Department of Agriculture" into an institution attempting to destroy the crops of other countries by using bacteria. This news shows that the American aggressors, regardless of the universal opposition of the people of the world, still want to continue bacteriological warfare, and are also plotting to conduct bacteriological warfare on a larger scale and more cruelly. However, the great victory achieved by the people of Korea and China in the anti-bacteriological warfare shows that any kind and any scale of bacteriological warfare by the American aggressors can be defeated. The American aggressors' attempt to continue and expand the conspiracy of bacteriological warfare, besides inevitably suffering greater defeats, can never achieve any purpose.

### 美国“展望”杂志暴露  美国政府机构正在大规模培养毒性细菌

    美国“展望”杂志暴露
    美国政府机构正在大规模培养毒性细菌
    【新华社十六日讯】正当美国政府竭力抵赖它对朝中两国人民进行细菌战的罪行的时候，美国杂志又一次透露出美国政府正在大规模地从事人工培养细菌的工作，以便继续进行野蛮的细菌战。据法新社华盛顿十四日电称：美国“展望”杂志在十四日出版的一期中说，至少有五个美国政府机构在从事人工培养细菌的工作。“展望”杂志说，这五个机构是：陆军化学处（按即陆军化学兵团）、公共卫生署、农业部、陆军卫生处和海军卫生处。该杂志说，美国的计划是：“培养新的，比自然发现的细菌毒性更大的细菌”，“使撒布新细菌的方法趋于完善”。该杂志并肆无忌惮地鼓吹对中国和苏联进行细菌战。
    美国侵略者一面对朝鲜和我国东北进行大规模的细菌战，拒绝谴责使用细菌武器并拒绝批准禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，一面口喊“人道主义”，百般抵赖对朝中人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行。现在，美国统治集团自己的杂志却再一次暴露出美国侵略者的血腥面目。美国侵略者不仅把“陆军化学处”、“陆军卫生处”和“海军卫生处”都作为进行细菌战的机构；而且把“公共卫生署”也变为从事屠杀他国人民的血腥机关，把“农业部”也变为企图利用细菌来毁灭其他国家农作物的机关。这个消息表明：美国侵略者不仅不顾全世界人民的普遍反对，仍然要继续进行细菌战，而且还阴谋更大规模地更残酷地进行细菌战。但是，朝中两国人民在反细菌战中所取得的伟大胜利，说明美国侵略者任何种类、任何规模的细菌战都是可以击败的。美国侵略者企图继续进行并扩大细菌战的阴谋，除了必然要遭受更大的失败之外，决不能达到任何目的。
