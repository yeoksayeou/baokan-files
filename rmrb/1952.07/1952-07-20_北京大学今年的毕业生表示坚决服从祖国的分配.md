    Peking University Graduates Pledge to Resolutely Obey the Motherland's Assignment
    Editor: As the motherland is about to begin large-scale economic construction, we are graduating from university, and we feel boundless joy in our hearts! This year, the country has given us meticulous care, clearly putting forward the principle of aligning learning with application. The State Council of the Central People's Government has also issued instructions on the assignment of college graduates, hoping to place us in the most appropriate positions. Who can fail to sincerely appreciate the happiness of living in such a country? And who can fail to feel from the depths of their hearts the Party and the government's love and care for us?
    Our generation is not one that doesn't understand disaster. We grew up in disaster. Our motherland was once so invaded and humiliated, so oppressed and exploited. At that time, the path before university graduates was either to become tools for imperialists and reactionaries to exploit the people, or to wander the world and taste bitterness.
    Liberation has arrived, the time that we Chinese youth have been looking forward to day and night has come. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have brought us infinite hope. Our motherland is filled with hope everywhere, shining with the light of happiness. Railways will soon extend in all directions, and countless factories and mines will be built in barren mountains and remote areas.
    We, the graduating class of Peking University this year, with unparalleled deep enthusiasm, gratitude, and sincere love, make a solemn guarantee to the Party: We will resolutely obey the motherland's assignment. We will forever be loyal to the cause of the people, and never fall behind under the banner of Mao Zedong!
    All graduating students of Peking University

    北京大学今年的毕业生表示坚决服从祖国的分配
    编辑同志：当祖国即将开始大规模经济建设的时候，我们大学毕业了，心中感到无限的欢欣！今年，国家对我们给了无微不至的照顾，明确地提出学用一致的原则，中央人民政府政务院并发布了关于高等学校毕业生分配工作的指示，希望把我们放在最恰当的岗位上。对于这，谁能不衷心地体会到生活在这样一个国度里的幸福？又谁能不从心的深处感到党和政府对我们的爱护和关怀？
    我们这一代不是不懂得灾难的人，我们是从灾难里长大的，我们的祖国曾经是那样受人侵略和凌辱，那样受着压迫和剥削，那时候，摆在大学毕业生面前的出路，不是作帝国主义和反动派剥削人民的工具，便是沦落天涯饱尝酸辛。
    解放了，我们中国青年朝夕盼望的时候来临了，毛主席和共产党给我们带来了无限的希望。我们祖国到处都充满着希望，闪耀着幸福的光芒。铁路将要四通八达，荒山僻野也将建立无数的工厂和矿场。
    我们北京大学的今年应届毕业生，怀着无比深厚的热情、感激和真诚的爱，向党提出了庄严的保证：坚决地服从祖国分配。我们要永远忠实于人民的事业，在毛泽东旗帜下永不掉队！
    北京大学全体毕业同学
