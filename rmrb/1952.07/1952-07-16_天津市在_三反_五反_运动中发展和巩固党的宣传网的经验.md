Editor's Note: The experience of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in developing and consolidating the propaganda network during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements is successful. The experience of many regions shows that only by developing and consolidating the Party's propaganda network in mass movements can a large number of outstanding elements be truly absorbed into the propaganda network organization, and the working ability of the original propagandists can be effectively exercised and improved, directly promoting the development of the movement. Therefore, all localities should pay serious attention to this work in various movements in the future.

After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the propaganda network work of the Tianjin Party has been developed and consolidated. According to current not very precise statistics: there are a total of 16,388 propagandists in the city. Among them, 7,062 propagandists were developed before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and 9,671 propagandists were developed during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. The newly developed propagandists this time are all activists in the movement. Before being approved as propagandists, they actively participated in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, and were tempered and tested in the struggles; after becoming propagandists, they worked actively and played a great role in promoting the movement.

The establishment, development and consolidation of the propaganda network this time started on April 1st, and by early June, after more than two months of efforts by party committees at all levels, the task has been basically completed. It is estimated that propagandists in state-owned and public-owned factories and enterprises account for 5% of the total number of employees; propagandists in large and medium-sized private factories account for slightly more than 4.3% of the total number of employees; and the ratio of propagandists in each district to the population has increased from 0.1% to 0.5%. In public and private factories, shops and street party branches, propaganda networks have been generally established except for special circumstances; in factories, shops and streets without party organizations, propaganda networks have also been partially established through individual party members or youth league organizations. The district committees and sub-party committees, in accordance with the principles of rectifying the propaganda network organization put forward by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, rectified the original propagandists, cancelled individual unqualified propagandists, and consolidated the propaganda network organization.

The main experiences in establishing, developing and consolidating the propaganda network this time are:

First, the leadership attaches importance to it, the plan is meticulous, and it is closely integrated with the central work. After the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee issued the plan for establishing, developing and consolidating the propaganda network, the district committees successively made their own specific plans within a few days. The secretaries of the Second, Ninth, and Tenth District Committees personally led this work. Su Ming, secretary of the Ninth District Committee, personally convened joint meetings of party branch secretaries and propaganda committee members of factories and organs, joint meetings of responsible cadres of cultural centers, democratic women's federations, and public security police stations, party and league member meetings of units preparing to establish a propaganda network, and meetings of "tiger-beating" team members, etc., to convey the district committee's plan for establishing, developing and consolidating the propaganda network, requesting all cadres to attach importance to this work, thereby creating conditions for establishing, developing and consolidating the propaganda network in a short period of time, enabling the work to proceed smoothly. Yu Wen, secretary of the Tenth District Committee, frequently listened to the reports of grass-roots party branch secretaries and propaganda committee members and gave instructions in a timely manner, so that the district developed more than 150 propagandists in less than a month.

Meticulous planning is the main feature of this work. The work plans of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the district committees are generally more specific, with situations, analysis, general guidelines, specific requirements, methods for completing tasks, and steps for implementation. Therefore, the smooth completion of this development and consolidation of the propaganda network work was guaranteed.

Integrating with the central work is also an important reason why this propaganda network work can be developed smoothly. Generally speaking, each district has combined this work with the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and clean-up campaigns. For example, the First District Committee, when leading the branches to discuss the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" propaganda work in the early stage of the movement, also arranged the work of establishing a propaganda network; the branches, when carrying out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" propaganda work, also publicized the significance of establishing a propaganda network and cultivated propagandist targets in a planned way. Therefore, the district has achieved remarkable results in propaganda network work. At the end of last year, the district was the most backward in the city's propaganda network work, with no propagandists; now, there are 1,013 propagandists, making it one of the districts with better propaganda network work.

Second, carry out in-depth publicity and deliberation, creating an atmosphere of "everyone supporting the propaganda network" and "everyone willing to be a propagandist" to prepare ideologically for the establishment of the propaganda network. The content of the publicity should be clear, specific, and popular, and combined with the actual situation of the local area; the publicity steps should be from top to bottom, from inside to outside, from activists to the broad masses. The methods should be bold, open, and diverse. When carrying out the work of developing and consolidating the propaganda network this time, each unit and district generally combined it with the central work, and carried out publicity on the significance of establishing a propaganda network, the tasks and conditions of propagandists, and development procedures at cadre meetings, party and league member meetings, activist meetings, and mass meetings, and made explanations in light of the ideological situation of the masses. When activists and the masses understood why the propaganda network should be established, they were very happy.

Third, under the unified leadership of the party committee, it is necessary to be good at relying on organizations and mobilizing the strength of the entire party. Because to complete such an urgent and arduous task, it is not enough to rely on a few cadres of the party committee propaganda department, it is necessary to mobilize the party organizations in the Youth League, trade unions, democratic women's federations, cultural centers, public security police stations, etc., and complete the task through them. Because the district committees generally used this correct working method, although there were many central tasks at that time (such as "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," clean-up campaigns, etc.), they finally completed the work plan as scheduled.

The result of mobilizing the strength of the entire party to develop and consolidate the propaganda network basically overcame the serious imbalance that had long existed in the propaganda network work, expanded the party's propaganda strength, and laid the foundation for universal and regular propaganda and education of the people.

Fourth, strengthen supervision and inspection, and exchange experiences. Because these two tasks were carried out conscientiously, the work of developing and consolidating the propaganda network this time did not deviate significantly and was successfully completed. The district committees paid more attention to this aspect, and therefore, phenomena such as lowering the conditions for propagandists and not strictly fulfilling the development procedures were corrected in a timely manner.

The main problems currently existing in the propaganda network work are:

First, improve the political and professional level of propagandists, consolidate the newly established propaganda network, and improve the original propaganda network. To this end, propaganda training courses must be held in various ways to ensure that all propagandists receive basic training; at the same time, the leadership of the propaganda committee members of grass-roots party branches must be strengthened to help them establish some of the main working systems in the propaganda network work and ensure that they adhere to them; in units that have not carried out rectification work or have not carried it out thoroughly, rectification should continue to be carried out to maintain the purity of the party's propaganda team; lead propagandists to study in an organized and planned way, and constantly improve the political level of propagandists.

Second, strengthen the leadership of the work of reporters at the municipal and district levels, and standardize the work of reporters.

Third, restore the work of propagandists in organs, and combine the work of propagandists in organs with the work of street propaganda.

### 天津市在“三反”“五反”运动中发展和巩固党的宣传网的经验

    天津市在“三反”“五反”运动中发展和巩固党的宣传网的经验
    编者按：中共天津市委员会在“三反”“五反”运动中发展和巩固宣传网的经验是成功的。许多地区的经验说明，只有在群众运动中发展和巩固党的宣传网，才能够真正吸收大批优秀分子参加宣传网的组织，并有效地锻炼和提高原有的宣传员的工作能力，直接推动运动的开展。因此，今后各地在各种运动中都应该认真注意这项工作。
    经过伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，天津市党的宣传网工作获得了发展和巩固。据目前不十分精确的统计：全市共有宣传员一万六千三百八十八名。其中“三反”“五反”运动前发展的宣传员有七千零六十二名，“三反”“五反”运动中发展的宣传员九千六百七十一名。此次新发展的宣传员，均为运动中的积极分子。他们在未被批准为宣传员以前，就积极地参加了“三反”“五反”斗争，并在斗争中受到了锻炼和考验；做宣传员以后，积极工作，对运动起了很大的推动作用。
    此次建立、发展和巩固宣传网工作，是从四月一日开始的，至六月上旬，经过各级党委两月余的努力，已基本完成任务。计：国营公营工厂企业中的宣传员，已占职工总数的百分之五；私营大、中工厂宣传员占职工总数的百分之四点三强；各区宣传员在人口中之比数由百分之零点一增至零点五。公、私营厂店和街道党支部中，除特殊情况者外，均普遍建立了宣传网；在没有党组织的厂店和街道中，也通过个别党员或青年团的组织，部分地建立了宣传网。各区委、分党委按照市委宣传部提出的整顿宣传网组织的原则，对原有宣传员进行了整顿，取消了个别不称职的宣传员，巩固了宣传网的组织。
    这次建立、发展和巩固宣传网的主要经验是：
    第一，领导重视，计划周密，并和中心工作紧密结合。自天津市委宣传部发布建立、发展和巩固宣传网的计划后，各区委在数日内即先后做出自己的具体计划。二、九、十区等区委书记并亲自领导了这一工作。九区区委书记苏明亲自召开了工厂、机关党的支部书记和宣传委员联席会，文化馆、民主妇女联合会、公安派出所负责干部联席会，准备建立宣传网单位的党、团员大会以及“打虎”队员会议等，传达了区委关于建立、发展和巩固宣传网的计划，要求全体干部重视这一工作，因而在短期内为建立、发展和巩固宣传网创造了条件，使工作得以顺利进行。十区区委书记于文经常听取基层党支部书记和宣传委员的汇报，及时给予指示，使该区在不足一个月中，就发展了一百五十余名宣传员。
    计划周密，是这次工作的主要特点。天津市委宣传部和各区委的工作计划一般地都较具体，计划中有情况，有分析，有总的方针，有具体要求，有完成任务的方法，有执行的步骤。因而，保证了这次发展和巩固宣传网工作的顺利完成。
    和中心工作相结合，也是这次宣传网工作能够得到顺利发展的重要原因。一般地说，各区在进行这一工作时，都和“三反”“五反”以及清洁卫生运动结合起来了。如一区区委在运动初期领导各支部讨论“三反”“五反”宣传工作时，便同时布置了建立宣传网的工作；各支部在开展“三反”“五反”宣传工作时，也就宣传了建立宣传网的意义，并有计划地培养了宣传员对象。因此，该区在宣传网工作上得到了显著成绩。去年年底，该区在全市宣传网工作中是最落后的，那时没有一名宣传员；现在，已有宣传员一千零十三名，成为宣传网工作做得比较好的一个区了。
    第二，深入宣传酝酿，造成“大家拥护宣传网”“人人愿当宣传员”的气氛，为建立宣传网工作做好思想准备。宣传内容要明确、具体、通俗，和当地实际情况相结合；宣传步骤要自上而下，自内而外，由积极分子到广大群众。方式要大胆、公开、多种多样。各单位、各区在这次进行发展和巩固宣传网的工作时，一般地都结合中心工作，在干部会，党、团员会，积极分子会和群众大会上，进行了关于建立宣传网的意义、宣传员的任务、条件和发展手续的宣传，并针对群众的思想情况，进行了解释。当积极分子和群众明白了为什么要建立宣传网时，都非常高兴。
    第三，在党委统一领导下，要善于依靠组织，动员全党力量。因为要完成这样一件迫切而繁重的任务，只靠党委宣传部的几个干部是不行的，必须把青年团、工会、民主妇女联合会、文化馆、公安派出所等部门中的党组织动员起来，通过他们，完成任务。由于各区区委一般地都运用了这一正确的工作方法，虽然当时中心任务很多（如“三反”“五反”、清洁卫生等），但终于如期完成了工作计划。
    动员全党力量发展和巩固宣传网的结果，基本上克服了宣传网工作中长期存在的严重的不平衡状态，扩大了党的宣传力量，为普遍、经常地对人民群众进行宣传教育奠定了基础。
    第四，加强督促检查，交流经验。因为认真地进行了这两项工作，所以使这次发展和巩固宣传网的工作没有发生大的偏向，顺利地完成了任务。各区委在这一方面都比较注意，因而，对某些降低宣传员条件，不严格履行发展手续等现象，都及时纠正了。
    目前，宣传网工作中存在的主要问题是：
    第一，提高宣传员的政治水平和业务水平，把新建立的宣传网巩固起来，将原有的宣传网提高一步。为此，须以各种方式举办宣传员训练班，使所有宣传员都受到基本的训练；同时要加强对基层党支部宣传委员的领导，帮助他们，把宣传网工作中的一些主要工作制度建立起来，并使其坚持执行；在尚未进行整顿工作或进行得不彻底的单位，应继续进行整顿，以保持党的宣传队伍的纯洁；领导宣传员有组织有计划地进行学习，不断地提高宣传员的政治水平。
    第二，加强对市、区级报告员工作的领导，使报告员工作正规化。
    第三，恢复机关宣传员工作，使机关宣传员工作和街道宣传工作结合起来。
