    Leting Matouying Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative Supplies Spoiled Rice
    Affecting the Health of Workers at Daqinghe Salt Field

    Editor: The Daqinghe Salt Field in Leting County, Hebei Province, is located in a coastal area, far from cities, making it very inconvenient for salt workers to purchase daily necessities. To solve this problem, the salt field negotiated with the Matouying Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Leting County in March of this year to establish a branch in the salt field's beach area. However, due to the incorrect management views of the leading cadres of the Matouying Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the work of the branch has many problems, causing dissatisfaction among all worker-shareholders.

    1. When the Matouying Town Cooperative initially established the branch in the beach area, it required each worker to invest 15 jin of millet. When the workers invested, the share capital was arbitrarily changed to 50 jin of millet, and they said: "Otherwise, the workers' daily necessities will not be supplied." 2. The cooperative supplied flour and shui nian rice to the members at a profit of 7% of the pure cost. When the members felt that the profit was too high and raised their opinions, the profit was reduced to 5%. The price of shui nian rice was announced to the members as 800 yuan per jin, but when sold it was 890 yuan per jin. Only after the members questioned it was the price reduced to 850 yuan per jin. 3. On the 26th of last month, the beach area branch transported a batch of moldy and deteriorated sorghum rice from the Matouying Town Cooperative and sold it to the members. After the members ate it, some had diarrhea and some had fever; two even fell ill. Although the members had raised their opinions several times, they did not seriously try to solve the problem. This practice of the Matouying Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative has, to varying degrees, damaged the health of the workers and affected the development of the increased production and frugality campaign. We believe that the Matouying Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative should conduct a deep self-criticism of this serious irresponsible work style.

    乐亭马头营镇供销社供应坏米
    影响大清河盐场工人健康
    编辑同志：河北省乐亭县大清河盐场位于滨海地区，距离城市较远，盐工购买生活必需品非常不便。为了解决这一问题，盐场在本年三月间，与乐亭县马头营镇供销合作社洽商好在盐场滩区设立了一个分社。但由于马头营镇供销合作社领导干部的经营观点不正确，所以分社的工作存在很多问题，引起全体工人社员的不满。
    一、马头营镇社开始在滩区设立分社时，让每个工人用十五斤小米入股，等到工人入股时，又随便把股金改为五十斤小米，并且说：“不然就不供给工人的生活必需品。”二、该社供应社员的面粉和水埝米，竟按纯利百分之七的利润卖给社员，社员认为利润太大，提出意见以后，才将利润降低到百分之五。水埝米的价格，向社员宣布的是八百元一斤，但卖的时候却是每斤八百九十元，经社员提出质问，每斤才降到八百五十元出售。三、上月二十六日滩区分社从马头营镇社运来了一批发霉变质的高粱米卖给社员，社员吃了后，有的泻肚，有的发烧；还病倒了两个。对此，社员们虽曾提过数次意见，但他们也不认真设法解决。马头营镇供销合作社的这种做法，不同程度地损害了工人的健康，影响了增产节约运动的开展。我们认为马头营镇供销合作社应对这种严重的不负责任作风进行深刻检讨。
