    We Overcame the Difficulties of Insufficient Grain and Lack of Animal Power

    Editor: Our mutual aid team transitioned into an agricultural production cooperative in late February, and everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. However, we encountered two difficulties: First, due to flooding last year, each household in the cooperative harvested nearly half the usual grain, and by early March this year, two out of eight households had no grain to eat, five could barely manage, and only one had more grain; Second, we lacked the strength to replace the old and weak livestock with robust ones, which affected our spring plowing. These two difficulties did not defeat us. Our cooperative's director, Cong Shulin, a Communist Party member, said to everyone:

    "With the Communist Party leading us, what are we afraid of? As long as we work hard, we can solve any difficulty." He and cooperative member Wang Hongzhang voluntarily lent grain to households without it and proposed mutual assistance and relief methods, exchanging grain among themselves, which temporarily solved the difficulty of insufficient grain within the cooperative. Later, the higher-level government loaned us twelve shi of grain, which basically solved our food problem. During the spring plowing, the cooperative members put forward the slogan "Rather let the livestock rest than let people be idle," and the women also guaranteed the slogan "Rather let the meal wait for people than let people wait for the meal." They also freed up five full laborers to work in the fields. Because everyone was united and plowed quickly, all 18 hectares, 5 mu, and 8 fen of land in the cooperative were planted from May 1st to 13th. We all used people to pull rollers to flatten the land, without using livestock. The cooperative members happily said: "The agricultural production cooperative is stronger than the mutual aid team. Last year, the mutual aid team did not apply topdressing fertilizer to the large fields at all, but this year all 7 hectares of land have been topdressed." Our agricultural production cooperative has also had two significant advantages since its establishment: First, we broke down land boundaries, which saved labor; from plowing the stubble to finishing the planting, we saved more than forty workdays alone. Second, we expanded the cultivated area. Now we have already drawn up a summer hoeing plan, and before the summer hoeing, we will dig a drinking water well and build three manure heap bases that are three zhang long, two zhang wide, and two chi high. We will also carry 20,000 jin of stinky mud and prepare 1,000 jin of chicken manure for future topdressing. In addition to chopping 1,500 jin of grain straw, the women will also make 72 summer clothes and 80 pairs of shoes so that they can fully participate in field labor during the summer hoeing.

### 我们克服了吃粮不够和畜力不足的困难

    我们克服了吃粮不够和畜力不足的困难
    编辑同志：我们互助组自二月下旬转为农业生产合作社，大家生产情绪很高。但是，我们碰到了两个困难：一，去年全社各户因遭水灾，少收了近一半的粮食，到今年三月初，八户人家已有两户没有粮食吃了，有五户还能勉强维持，只有一户粮食较多；二，没有力量把老弱牲畜换成硬实的，这就影响了我们的春耕。这两个困难都没有难倒我们。我们社的主任丛树林是个共产党员，他向大家说：
    “有共产党领导，咱们还怕啥？只要我们加劲干，啥困难也能解决。”他和社员王洪章主动地把粮食借给没粮户，并提出互救互济办法，互相串换粮食，这就暂时解决了社内吃粮不足的困难。后来上级政府贷给我们十二石粮食，基本上解决了我们的食粮问题。春耕时，社员们提出“宁叫牲口休息，不叫人呆着”的口号，妇女们也保证“宁叫饭等人，不叫人等饭”的口号，她们还腾出五个全劳力下地。由于大伙团结好、种地快，全社十八垧五亩八分地，从五月一日到十三日，全部种完了。我们全用人拉磙子压地，没有用牲口压地。社员们高兴地说：“农业生产合作社比互助组更强啦，头年的互助组的大田一点没上追肥，今年七垧地全都上了追肥。”我们的农业生产合作社成立以来，还有两个显著的优点：一是打破了地界，干活省了工，单从刨楂子到种完地，就省了四十多工；一是扩大了耕地面积。现在我们已经订出夏锄计划，并要在夏锄前打好一口吃水井和三个三丈长、二丈宽、二尺高的粪堆底子，还要挑两万斤臭泥土，准备一千斤鸡粪，以便日后施追肥。妇女们除把一千五百斤谷草铡好外，还要做好七十二件夏衣和八十双鞋，以便到夏锄时全力参加地里劳作。
