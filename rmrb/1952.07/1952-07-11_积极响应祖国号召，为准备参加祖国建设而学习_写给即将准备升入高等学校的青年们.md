Actively Respond to the Call of the Motherland and Study in Preparation for Participating in the Construction of the Motherland
– A Message to Young People About to Enter Higher Education Institutions
Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of Education, Central People's Government

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been making rapid progress in building a strong and happy motherland in all aspects. In these three years, our new China has achieved brilliant accomplishments and progress in national defense, economic construction, and cultural and educational construction, but this is only a beginning. We are now actively preparing to launch large-scale planned economic construction.

With the planned nature of national economic construction, the people's education work, which cultivates talents for national construction, must also strengthen its planning to ensure that the cultivation of construction cadres can meet the needs of national economic construction in terms of both quantity and quality, and closely coordinate with national economic construction work. This year's unified enrollment regulations for national higher education institutions meet this requirement and reflect the needs of national construction. Based on the focus of national construction in the coming years, the government has decided to prioritize the enrollment of higher education institutions this year in disciplines such as engineering, teacher training, medicine, science, political science and law, and Russian language. In the field of engineering, emphasis is placed on departments such as geology, machinery, civil engineering, water conservancy, architecture, and mining. Science disciplines closely related to engineering will focus on the three departments of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. At the same time, because the construction of the new China is comprehensive and requires various types of specialized talents, it also takes into account disciplines such as agriculture, literature and history, arts, and finance and economics. These disciplines are only relatively reduced in enrollment quota because of their different proportions in the current overall national construction and because the total number of high school graduates is slightly insufficient at this stage. However, it is not as some students imagine, thinking that these disciplines are "unpopular" and there is no future in studying them. In the people's own higher education institutions, talents cultivated in any department are needed for the people's construction cause, and therefore can contribute to the people and have infinitely broad prospects.

This summer, national higher education institutions plan to enroll more than 50,000 new students in different departments (excluding the number of teachers trained in higher normal schools). The new China has brought opportunities for our generation of young people to engage in the construction of the motherland. Every young person preparing to enter university will inevitably feel extremely happy and honored, willing to bravely shoulder this serious and arduous task, and study for the great construction cause of the motherland.

In the new China, the interests of the state and the interests of the people are completely consistent. Today, we have infinitely broad prospects because our motherland has freed itself from the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and thus can carry out great economic construction. Therefore, creating a happy future for the motherland first is also opening up a happy future for oneself. The excellent quality of serving the people that revolutionary youth should have lies in being able to unite personal interests and national interests well, and consciously abandon personal interests and obey the interests of the motherland and the people when personal interests conflict with national interests. Students should also adopt this attitude when choosing their college preferences, starting from the needs of national construction, appropriately combining their interests, personal specialties, and health conditions, and determining their specific learning preferences with a realistic attitude. The government will also carefully consider the students' preferences and each person's strengths, so that the students can play the greatest role in the construction of the motherland. However, because the enrollment plan is formulated according to national needs, each school and each department has a certain enrollment quota, so it is practically impossible to fully meet the subjective wishes of every student. After enrollment, if the wishes of a very small number of people are not taken care of, it is hoped that the students will consciously obey the needs of the motherland and embark on the learning post assigned by the motherland happily and bravely.

Some students only consider personal prospects, personal status, personal honor, and even personal enjoyment when choosing their preferences, without considering or rarely considering the needs of national construction. For example, in the choice of departments, some think that primary and secondary school teachers have low status and limited career prospects, and are afraid of chalk dust, so they are unwilling to apply to normal colleges. Some students are afraid of the hardship of going to the countryside and are unwilling to study agriculture. Some students are afraid of going down into the mines and are unwilling to study mining and metallurgy. These students only want to choose some "easy" and "relaxed" jobs that can "become famous," attempting to enjoy the fruits of labor without labor or with little labor. Looking at the scene of people across the country working selflessly on various posts to build the motherland today, young people should despise these erroneous ideas of loving ease and hating work.

Some students think that only studying engineering can "get by" and "have a future." Therefore, even if they lack a certain foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, they blindly apply to engineering-related departments in order to catch up with the trend and avoid being looked down upon for applying to other disciplines. These students do not understand that the construction of the new China requires various specialized talents. As long as they can wholeheartedly serve the people and master any specialized knowledge and technology, they will contribute to the construction of the new China, and the Chinese people will give them the same importance and honor.

It is perfectly appropriate for young people to have various lofty ideals; however, the ideals of revolutionary youth must be combined with reality and the needs of the country, not empty fantasies, and must be considered in light of the great ideal of the motherland. However, some students choose their preferences based on subjective fantasies, such as wanting to study aviation in order to see the scenery of "taking off in the early morning glow and landing in the evening glow"; wanting to study water conservancy in order to see the "Three Gorges scenery"; and studying horticulture in order to "eat watermelons." These are all unrealistic and naive subjective fantasies, and therefore do not meet the requirements of revolutionary interests.

A small number of students excessively emphasize their personal preferences, determined to enter a certain school or department. They say: "I will definitely get into a certain university," "If I don't get into a certain university, I would rather take the exam again next year." In order to cultivate themselves into excellent construction talents, hoping to enter so-called good schools, there is certainly a certain reason; but if they only admire the reputation of a certain school and the fame of its professors, and they are not prepared to work hard, they will still not become useful construction talents for the country. Moreover, the phenomenon of imbalanced development of all higher education institutions in terms of faculty and equipment, which was left over from the old society, will be gradually overcome in the recent adjustment of departments; some schools will be merged or change their nature; some completely new schools will be established; and faculty and equipment will be rationally adjusted and enriched. In the new China, all higher education institutions have become the people's own schools, and the people will certainly give them the same care and attention. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, all higher education institutions in the country will gradually be run well, and they will be able to cultivate cadres with both ability and integrity. This can be asserted. Some students may say: Faculty and equipment can certainly be adjusted, but the region cannot be changed. Therefore, in terms of region, they still insist on being in Beijing or other big cities, because it is the political center and greatly helps their progress. These students basically still put personal gains and losses above the interests of the country and the people. The lofty ambition of revolutionary youth does not lie in adapting to the existing environment, but in being able to overcome difficulties, transform the environment, and create a better future.

Most students are basically willing to obey the needs of national construction, but due to a lack of understanding of the needs of the country and the nature and role of certain departments, they lack a comprehensive basis for choosing their preferences, and thus produce fluctuating emotions or wait for the government to make a unified allocation. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly introduce some departments whose roles are not well understood by students below:

The task of higher normal schools is to train teachers for ordinary middle schools, worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, normal schools, and general courses in secondary technical schools. Due to the rapid development of economic construction, the country needs to train a large number of senior and intermediate construction cadres. The source of these cadres mainly relies on graduates of ordinary middle schools and worker-peasant accelerated middle schools. Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of middle school teachers to meet the needs of developing secondary education, so that middle school graduates can meet the needs of cultivating national construction cadres in terms of both quantity and quality. Therefore, normal education is closely coordinated with the entire construction work of our country. After students recognize the great role that normal education plays in the entire construction work and appreciate the solemn and important task of people's teachers, they will inevitably eliminate the erroneous perceptions that being a people's teacher has no future and low social status, and consciously shoulder the glorious task of cultivating talents for the motherland.

Departments in science fields study and research basic sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. These sciences are the highest summary of human experience in production struggle. Only on the theoretical basis of these basic sciences can we correctly guide and promote the improvement and development of all engineering, agricultural, medical, and other production technologies, because they are the foundation of all applied sciences. With the development of production and construction, general production departments, schools at all levels, and scientific research institutions all feel the lack of talents in basic sciences, especially in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, science is also one of the focuses of enrollment this summer.

The establishment of the Chinese people's democratic regime is the result of the heroic struggle of countless revolutionary soldiers. Therefore, we must cherish the fruits of this revolutionary victory. In order to smoothly carry out various construction tasks in the future, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the work of political power construction. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, a group of outstanding young people must master the work of people's political power. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns exposed the shortcomings of political power work in some areas, mainly due to the small number and weak quality of cadres. Therefore, actively training a group of excellent political and legal cadres has become an urgent task. The political and legal departments of higher education institutions, with the strong help of political and legal organs, should shoulder the task of cultivating new-type political and legal cadres.

In order to thoroughly complete the new democratic construction cause, so as to move towards the goals of socialism and communism, we must accelerate the study of the Soviet Union's advanced political struggle and the valuable experience of various construction undertakings. To learn from the Soviet Union, we must first master the Russian language. Therefore, cultivating a large number of Russian translators has also become a very important political task. At present, adding Russian courses in schools at all levels and absorbing the Soviet Union's advanced experience in government agencies and enterprises urgently requires a large number of talents who are proficient in Russian.

As mentioned above, our country is about to launch large-scale economic construction, but the existing various specialized construction talents, especially industrial construction talents, are far from keeping up with the actual needs of construction. In order to meet the urgent needs of national construction, it is necessary to vigorously run specialized courses, using a relatively short period of time to cultivate a relatively large number of specialized construction cadres to participate in various industrial sectors, so as not to delay the progress of production and construction plans. Therefore, the enrollment plan for this year stipulates: adopting the principle of combining short-term rapid training and long-term cultivation, we should run a large number of specialized courses. Students can respond to the call of the motherland, strive to participate in the construction of the motherland as soon as possible, and volunteer to apply for specialized courses and vocational schools, which is a glorious expression of love for the motherland. Some students worry that the study period of specialized courses is short, so they cannot learn a lot of things, which is an unnecessary worry. It should be known that specialized courses are the focus of development in the field of engineering, and governments at all levels have the determination to run specialized courses well, and all higher education institutions in the country attach great importance to them, preparing to use the best teachers to serve as teachers of specialized courses. Specialized courses still belong to the nature of higher education institutions, cultivating senior construction talents; compared with the specialized colleges of higher education institutions, the only difference is that the curriculum is more streamlined and concentrated, and more specialized, so that they can complete the courses they should learn in a shorter period of time, in order to meet the current urgent needs of the country. In short, we can say with certainty that as long as you study hard, you can acquire the specialized knowledge needed in the workplace in two or three years. With this knowledge as a foundation, coupled with future training and research in actual work, you can also become proficient in business and make significant contributions to the people. At the same time, the government departments and various factories and mines have been paying more attention to the after-work study of cadres. The opportunity for in-service cadres to pursue further studies will certainly be greater in the future, and there is no worry that there will be no way to continue learning what is not learned enough in school.

Young people preparing to enter higher education institutions, the great construction work of the motherland is waiting for you. The people's expectations of you are earnest, and your responsibilities are also arduous. I hope that you can seriously treat such an important political task, correct your attitude towards entering school, obey the needs of the motherland, and enter school to study for the great construction cause of the motherland. In the future learning positions, carry forward the courage of young people who are firm, unwavering, and unafraid of difficulties, constantly improve their ideological level, master modern science and technology, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new China.

    积极响应祖国号召，为准备参加祖国建设而学习
    ——写给即将准备升入高等学校的青年们
    中央人民政府教育部副部长  曾昭抡
    解放以来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，从各方面突飞猛进地建设着强大、幸福的祖国。这三年中，我们新中国在国防建设、经济建设、文化教育建设各方面，都已获得了辉煌的成就与进展，但这还只是一个开端。我们现在正在积极地准备展开大规模的有计划的经济建设。
    随着国家经济建设的计划化，作为培养国家建设人才的人民教育工作，也就必须加强计划性，使建设干部的培养在数量上和质量上均能适应国家经济建设需要，和国家经济建设工作密切配合起来。今年全国高等学校统一招生的规定，就是符合了这种要求，体现了祖国建设的需要。政府根据今后几年国家建设的重点，决定今年高等学校招生重点放在工、师范、医、理、政法、俄文等学科；而在工科方面，又侧重于地质、机械、土木、水利、建筑、采矿等系科；和工科有密切关系的理科则以数学、物理、化学三系为重点。同时由于新中国的建设是全面的，需要各种各类的专门人才，因此也兼顾到农业、文史、艺术、财经等学科。这些科系，只是由于在目前整个国家建设中比重的不同，也由于在目前阶段中高中毕业生的总数稍感不够，其招生名额不得不相对地减少，但并不如有些同学所想像的，以为这些科系是“冷门”，学了没有什么前途。在人民自己的高等学校里，任何系科培养出来的人才，都是为人民建设事业所需要的，因而同样都能对人民有所贡献，而且都有无限广阔的前途。
    今年暑期全国高等学校计划招收五万多名不同系科的新生（不包括高等师范学校中调训教师人数）。新中国为我们这一代青年带来了从事祖国建设的机会。每位即将准备升学的青年必然会感到无比的幸福和光荣，愿意勇敢地肩负起这一严肃、艰巨的任务，为祖国伟大建设事业而学习。
    在新中国，国家利益和人民利益是完全一致的。今天我们得到无限远大的前途，就是由于我们祖国摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义的压迫，从而能够进行伟大的经济建设。因此，首先创造了祖国的幸福前途，也就是开辟了自己幸福的前途。革命青年应有的为人民服务的优秀品质，就在于能将个人利益和国家利益很好地统一起来，并在个人利益与国家利益冲突时自觉地放弃个人利益，服从祖国和人民的利益。同学们在选择自己的升学志愿时也应采取这种态度，从国家建设需要出发，适当地结合自己的志趣、个人的专长及健康条件等，以实事求是的态度来决定个人学习的具体志愿；在政府方面，也一定会很好考虑同学们的志愿和每个人的特长，使同学们对祖国建设发挥最大的作用。但是因为招生计划是按照国家需要来制定的，每个学校、每个系科，都有一定的招生名额，因此事实上不可能完全符合每位同学的主观愿望。在录取以后，如果有极少数人的志愿，没有得到照顾，还希望同学们自觉地服从祖国需要，愉快、勇敢地踏上祖国分配的学习岗位。
    有些同学在选择志愿时只从个人前途、个人地位、个人荣誉、甚至于个人享受出发，不考虑或很少考虑国家建设的需要。如在系科选择上，有的以为中小学教师地位低、出路不大、怕吃粉笔灰，因而不愿投考师范学院，有的同学怕下乡吃苦而不愿学农，有的同学怕下矿坑而不愿学矿冶等。这些同学只想挑选一些“省事”、“轻松”而又能“出名”的工作，企图不费劳动或少出劳动而坐享劳动的果实。看看今天全国人民正在各种不同岗位上为建设祖国而忘我地劳动的情景，青年们应该鄙弃这些好逸恶劳的错误思想。
    有的同学以为只有学工才“吃得开”、“有出路”，因此即使自己缺乏一定的数理化基础，但为了赶时髦，怕投考其他学科被人瞧不起，于是也盲目地投考工程方面的系科。这些同学不了解新中国建设需要各种专门人才，只要能全心全意为人民服务，掌握任何一门专门知识和技术，都会对新中国的建设有所贡献，中国人民对他们也会给以同等的重视和荣誉。
    青年们抱有各种崇高的理想是完全应该的；但是革命青年的理想必须是结合实际、结合国家的需要，不是空虚的幻想，而且必须在祖国伟大理想的前程下来考虑自己的理想。但有些同学选择志愿从主观幻想出发，如有的志愿学航空，为的是想看“在早霞中起飞，晚霞中降落”的景色；想学水利为了看“三峡风光”；学园艺为了“吃西瓜”。这些都是不切实际的、幼稚的主观幻想，因而也是不符合革命利益的要求的。
    有少数同学过分强调个人的志愿，抱定非某校某系不进，他们说：“说什么也得上某某大学”，“考不上某某大学，宁愿明年再考。”为了将自己培养成为优秀的建设人才，希望进所谓好学校，固然还有一定的理由；但如果徒慕某校名声大、教授有名望，而自己不准备积极努力，结果仍然不能成为国家有用的建设人才。何况过去旧社会所遗留下来的全部高等学校在师资、设备等方面发展不平衡的现象，在最近院系大调整中都要逐步加以克服；若干学校将予合并或改变性质；若干完全新的学校将要设立；师资、设备都将得到合理调整与充实。在新中国，所有高等学校都已成为人民自己的学校，人民对它们不会不予以同样的爱护和重视。在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，全国所有高等学校都会逐步办好，都能培养出德才兼备的干部，这是可以断言的。有的同学也许会说：师资设备固然可以调剂，但是地区是没有法子改变的，因此在地区上仍然要坚持在北京或其他大城市，因为它是政治中心，对自己进步帮助大。这些同学基本上仍是将个人得失放在国家人民利益之上。革命青年的雄伟抱负，不在于适应现成的环境，而在于能够克服困难，改造环境，创造美好的将来。
    大部分同学基本上都是愿意服从祖国建设需要的，但由于对于祖国需要和某些科系的性质、作用不够了解，在选择志愿上缺乏全面的根据，因而产生动荡不定的情绪，或等待政府统一分配的想法。因此有必要将同学们所不太了解其作用的某些系科，在下面分别简略的作一介绍：
    高等师范学校的任务，在于培养普通中学、工农速成中学、师范学校和中等技术学校普通课的师
    资。由于经济建设的迅速发展，国家需要培养大量
    高级和中级的建设干部，这些干部的来源绝大部分
    都依赖普通中学和工农速成中学的毕业生。所以必须大量培养中学师资以适应发展中等教育的需要，
    使中学毕业同学在数量上和质量上都能满足培养国
    家建设干部的需要。因此，师范教育是和我们整个国家的建设工作密切配合着的。同学们认识了师范教育在整个建设工作中所起的伟大的作用，体会到
    人民教师的庄严、重大的任务后，必然会清除当人民教师没有前途、社会地位低等等错误认识，自觉地担负起为祖国培养人才的光荣任务。
    理科方面的系科是学习与研究数学、物理、化学、生物等基础科学的。这些科学是人类生产斗争经验的最高的总结。只有在这些基本科学的理论基础上，才能正确地指引和推动一切工程、农业、医学等生产技术的改进和发展，因为它们是一切应用科学的基础。随着生产建设的发展，目前一般生产部门、各级学校以及科学研究机构，都感到基础科学人才的缺乏，尤其是数学、物理、化学方面的人才。因此今年暑期招生中也将理科作为重点之一。
    中国人民民主政权的建立，是无数革命战士英勇奋斗的结果，因此，我们必须十分珍视这革命胜利的果实，而今后为要顺利进行各项建设工作，更需要继续加强政权建设工作。为了巩固人民民主专政，必须有一部分优秀的青年去掌握人民政权工作。“三反”、“五反”中暴露出某些地区的政权工作尚有缺点，主要在于干部量少质弱，所以积极培养一批优秀的政法干部，更成为当务之急。高等学校政法学系在政法机关的大力帮助下，应该担负起培养新型政法干部的任务来。
    为了彻底完成新民主主义建设事业，以便向社会主义、共产主义目标迈进，我们必须加紧学习苏联先进的政治斗争和各种建设事业的宝贵经验。要学习苏联，首先应该掌握俄文，因此大量培养俄文翻译人才也成为非常重要的政治任务。目前各级学校增设俄文课程以及政府机构、企业部门吸收苏联先进经验，都迫切需要大量精通俄文的人才。
    上面已经说过，我们国家即将展开大规模的经济建设，但现有各种专门建设人才，特别是工业建设人才，还远远赶不上建设的实际需要。为了满足国家建设的急迫的需要，必须大力兴办专修科，用较短的时间培养较多较专的建设干部，参加到各种产业部门去工作，免得耽误生产建设计划的进行。所以今年招生方案规定：采取定期速成和长期培养统筹兼顾的方针，应该大量举办专修科。同学们能够响应祖国的号召，争取早日参加祖国的建设，志愿投考专修科和专科学校，这是热爱祖国的光荣表现。有些同学耽心专修科的学习期限短，因而学不到很多东西，那是不必要的过虑，须知专修科既是工科方面的发展重点，各级人民政府都具有一定要办好专修科的决心，全国各高等学校也都予以极端重视，准备用最好的教员担任专修科的教员。专修科仍是属于高等学校性质，培养高级建设人才的；和高等学校的专门学院相比，所不同的，只在于课程较为精简集中，更为专门，使其能在较少的时间内学完应学的课程，以适应国家目前的迫切需要。总之，我们可以肯定地说，只要自己努力学习，在两三年的时间内，是能够获得在工作岗位上所需要的专门知识的。有了这些知识作基础，再加上以后在实际工作中的锻练、钻研，一样能够精通业务，对人民作出重大的贡献。同时对于干部的业余学习，政府各部门以及各处厂矿，已在予以更多的注意。在职干部进修的机会，将来一定会比较多，在学校里学得不够的东西，不愁没有继续学习的途径。
    准备升入高等学校学习的青年们，祖国伟大的建设工作正等待着你们。人民对你们的期望是殷切的，你们的责任也是艰巨的。希望你们能够严肃地对待这样一项重大的政治任务，端正升学的态度，服从祖国的需要，为祖国伟大的建设事业而入校学习。在未来的学习岗位上，发扬青年人坚定不移、不畏困难的勇气，不断提高自己的思想水平，掌握现代科学技术，为建设富强康乐的新中国而努力。
