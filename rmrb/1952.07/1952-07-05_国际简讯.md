　　Norwegian People Protest Against Plague General Ridgway's Visit to Norway
　　When Ridgway arrived in Oslo on June 30 for a three-day "visit," Oslo was plastered with slogans against Plague General Ridgway. "Freedom News" published an editorial saying, "Don't interfere in our country, go home, Mr. Ridgway!"

　　North African Port of Bône Dockworkers Refuse to Handle War Materials
　　On June 18 and 19, dockworkers in the port of Algiers, Algeria, refused to work on the ship "Aura," which was sailing to Indochina. "Humanité" reported on June 24 that French authorities were forced to sail the ship to the port of Bône. The dockworkers there also refused to handle the materials, expressing solidarity with the dockworkers of Algiers who opposed the colonial war in Indochina.

　　U.S. Army Department Plans to Build New Germ Warfare Experiment Institute
　　The U.S. Army Department has drafted plans to build a new germ warfare experiment institute. This institute, like the U.S. Detrick Camp's famous center for researching and producing germ weapons, will conduct research on germ warfare. This institute will be built on Plum Island, located in Long Island Sound, near the densely populated areas of Long Island and New York City. Army Corps of Engineers Chief Colonel Gaertner requested Congress on June 17 to allocate $5,286,000 for the reconstruction and new construction on a 795-acre plot of land on Plum Island. Gaertner's testimony in Congress indicated that the research on Plum Island would not be limited to germ warfare, but would also include research on chemical and radiation warfare.

　　Residents of Long Island and some political leaders in the Long Island residential area oppose the plan to establish a new germ warfare center. The American Labor Party issued a strong protest statement, calling on the people to defeat the U.S. military's new evil conspiracy.
