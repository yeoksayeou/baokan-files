Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 25th: The administrative meetings of the delegations of both sides in the armistice negotiations have now been going on for twenty-two days. Excluding the four days of recess, the delegations of both sides have held a total of eighteen administrative meetings. Due to our adherence to the agreement regarding the secret nature of administrative meetings, the content of the meetings has not been published. However, the United States, which has always used the violation of agreements as a means to conduct one-sided propaganda to deceive the world, has in recent days repeatedly copied their old trick of violating the agreement on the administrative meetings of staff officers in late March, revealing the content of the meetings through the side channels of Associated Press and Agence France-Presse reporters. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th revealed that our side "refuses to recognize 20,000 Chinese prisoners of war and would rather sacrifice their families than allow them to return home." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd went further, attempting to distort our position, saying that our side only "insists on the forced repatriation of all Chinese prisoners held by the UN forces." The US side's despicable behavior of distorting facts and creating rumors and discord should be spurned by the people of the world.

Since the US side changed its attitude of refusing to negotiate in May and June on July 1st, and expressed its willingness to obtain a solution suitable to both sides' requirements on the basis of releasing and repatriating all prisoners held by both sides under Article 51 of the Armistice Agreement, our side proposed holding administrative meetings so that representatives of both sides could negotiate a truly fair and reasonable solution suitable to both sides' requirements without interference. However, while the administrative meetings were in progress, the US side, following its狂轰滥炸on the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants, on the one hand, frantically bombed the peaceful city of Pyongyang and peaceful residents of Korea, and on the other hand, repeatedly violated our country's northeastern airspace, strafing and wounding our people, and its senior naval and army officials arrogantly issued provocative remarks and engaged in wanton threats. The US side's purpose in doing so is obviously to attempt to use so-called military pressure to cooperate with their deceptive actions at the conference table, to forcibly make us accept their illegal voluntary repatriation, that is, the unreasonable demand to forcibly detain our captured personnel, otherwise they would rather delay or even undermine the negotiations.

The facts of the past twenty-odd days have proved that the US side's sinister attempt has gone bankrupt. The US side's military pressure outside the meeting cannot frighten us, and their deceptive actions inside the meeting cannot trick us. On the contrary, their sinister actions of internal and external collusion have suffered our relentless exposure and resolute blows. Therefore, their adventurous actions and provocative remarks have aroused the righteous anger and condemnation of the people of the world, and even their allies, under this situation, cannot help but issue complaints against them. All this has obviously put the US imperialists in an untenable position, so they have resumed the old tricks of delaying negotiations in May and June at the meeting, refusing to reason and refusing to negotiate, shortening the daily meeting time to five minutes, seven minutes, in the hope of delaying the administrative meeting as much as possible, so that they can hide behind the curtain of the secret nature of the meeting to escape the embarrassment of being condemned by truth and justice in front of the people of the world.

In view of the fact that this series of unreasonable and rogue actions by the US side has made the conduct of this administrative meeting meaningless, our delegation proposed on the 25th to end the administrative meeting and resume the open plenary meeting of the two delegations to conduct open negotiations. Obviously, this action by our delegation is necessary. The people of the world can judge from the truth of this negotiation the responsibility of the American aggressors for not complying with the agreement on the secret nature of administrative meetings and for adopting various methods to delay and obstruct administrative meetings, so as to be more vigilant against the US side's various performances in future negotiations.

    美方利用行政性会议的秘密性质进行破坏
    在我方无情揭发和坚决打击下美方内外配合的阴险行动完全破产
    【新华社开城二十五日电】停战谈判双方代表团大会行政性会议到现在已经二十二天了。其中除休会四天之外，双方代表团共举行了十八次行政性会议。由于我方坚守关于行政性会议的秘密性质的协议，会议内容尚未发表。但是，素来以破坏协议为手段，以便其作片面宣传来蒙混世人的美国方面，却在最近几天，一再抄袭他们在三月下旬破坏关于参谋官行政性会议的协议的故技，经过合众社与法新社记者侧面透露会议内容。合众社东京二十日电透露我方“不肯承认两万中国战俘甚至宁愿牺牲他们的家属也不愿回家”。经过法新社东京二十二日电所透露的，则进而意图歪曲我方立场，说什么我方只是“坚持强迫遣返联军所拘留的所有中国俘虏”。美方这种歪曲事实造谣挑拨的下流行为应该为全世界人民所唾弃。
    由于美方在七月一日改变了其在五六两个月中的拒不协商的态度，自己表示愿意在停战协定第五十一款释放与遣返双方所拘留的全部俘虏的基础上，取得适合双方要求的解决方案，我方才提议举行行政性会议，以便双方代表能够不受干扰地协商一个真正适合于双方要求的公平合理的解决方案。但是，在行政性会议正在进行的同时，美方却继其对鸭绿江水电厂的狂轰滥炸之后，一方面对朝鲜的和平城市平壤及和平居民疯狂轰炸，另一方面则多次侵犯我国东北领空，扫射杀伤我国人民，并由其海陆军高级负责人员狂妄地滥发挑衅性的言论，肆行威胁。美方这样做的目的，显然是企图以所谓军事压力配合他们在会议桌上带有欺骗性的行动，来强使我们接受他们的非法的自愿遣返，亦即强迫扣留我方被俘人员的无理主张，否则就宁可拖延乃至破坏谈判。
    二十多天以来的事实证明美方的这种阴险企图是破产了。美方在会外的军事压力既不可能骇倒我们，他们在会内的欺骗性行动，也不能使我们上他们的圈套。正相反，他们这种内外配合的阴险行动却遭受了我方无情的揭发和坚决的打击。因此他们的冒险行动和挑衅言论又激起了世界人民正义的愤怒和斥责，甚至他们的盟邦在这种形势下，也不能不对他们发出怨言。这一切显然使美帝国主义者处于难以招架的地步，于是他们就在会议上恢复了五六月间拖延谈判的老一套办法，又来拒不说理，拒不协商，把每日开会时间缩短到五分钟，七分钟，希图把行政性会议尽量拖延下去，以便他们躲在会议的秘密性质的帐幕后面，来逃避在世界人民面前遭受真理和正义斥责的窘境。
    鉴于美方这一连串的无理和无赖的行动已经使这个行政性会议的进行成为毫无意义，我方代表团乃于二十五日建议结束行政性会议，恢复公开的双方代表团大会，进行公开谈判。显然我方代表团的这一行动是必要的。世界人民从这一段谈判的真相中将可以判明美国侵略者对于不遵守关于行政性会议的秘密性质的协议，并采用种种办法来拖延和阻挠行政性会议的责任，从而对美方今后在谈判中的种种表现，更加提高警惕。
