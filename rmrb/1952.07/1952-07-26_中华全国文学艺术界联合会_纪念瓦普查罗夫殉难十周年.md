The commemorative meeting was presided over by writer Ding Ling. In her speech, she praised Vaptsarov's poetry for overflowing with deep love for the people and for life, and for encouraging the people's courage and perseverance in their struggle. She said: Vaptsarov's poetry belongs not only to the Bulgarian people but also to the Chinese people, because our causes are the same, and our revolutionary goals are common.
