According to the victims, Cai Shao, a victim imprisoned in the Ipoh concentration camp, died of serious injuries on the eve of his deportation due to excessive torture. Liu Zhaoming, a student from Klang Chinese High School, had his tongue burned and was severely beaten by British police in the concentration camp, and still has scars all over his body. Many compatriots have wounds that have not yet healed.
