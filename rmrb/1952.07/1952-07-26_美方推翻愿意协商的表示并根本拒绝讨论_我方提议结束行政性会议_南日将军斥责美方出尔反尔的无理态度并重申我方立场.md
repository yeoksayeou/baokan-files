Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 25th. In the administrative meeting of the delegations of both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiations, the U.S. side overturned its expressed willingness to negotiate and has fundamentally refused to engage in any discussion in recent days, rendering the administrative meeting ineffective. At the meeting on the 25th, our side's chief representative, General Nam Il, proposed to end the administrative meeting, and the delegations of both sides would enter into open discussions from the 26th. In order to accelerate the preparation of the draft armistice agreement, our side also suggested holding a meeting of staff officers from both sides to discuss the textual details of the armistice agreement. The U.S. side expressed its agreement to end the administrative meeting and stated that it would consider our side's suggestion to convene a staff officers' meeting. At the meeting on the 25th, General Nam Il tersely rebuked the other side's unreasonable attitude of going back on its word in the administrative meeting, and reaffirmed our side's fair and reasonable position on the POW issue. The full text of General Nam Il's speech:

	On July 1st, your side abandoned your two-month-long refusal to negotiate and expressed your willingness to seek "a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both sides" regarding the only remaining issue of POW repatriation in the Korean Armistice Negotiations, and proposed Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement regarding the principle of releasing and repatriating all POWs held by both sides, as the basis for resolving the POW repatriation issue. Although in the same day's speech, your side still claimed that some of the POWs held by your side could not be sent back to our side, which our side absolutely cannot agree to, based on our consistent position of resolving issues through negotiation to achieve the Korean armistice, our side expressed welcome to your side's willingness to negotiate.

	Our side suggested that, according to Articles 51 and 52 agreed upon by both sides, which guarantee that all POWs on both sides will no longer participate in the Korean War after repatriation in order to return home and live peaceful lives, the POWs on both sides should be reclassified according to nationality and region, and the POW lists exchanged by both sides on December 18, 1951, should be corrected. In order to solve the problem realistically, our side also suggested that the delegations of both sides enter into administrative meetings.

	Since both sides have agreed to the provisions of Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, only those Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, i.e., ROK soldiers or KPA captured personnel, who have homes in the area held by the detaining side, can be allowed to return home locally without repatriation, while foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, i.e., UN forces or CPV captured personnel, have no reason not to be fully repatriated home to live peaceful lives. Based on this principle, our side believes that your side's re-corrected list should be an approximate figure close to the 116,000 you yourselves admitted to, including 20,000 CPV POWs.

	On July 13th, your side presented a rough repatriation number of 83,000 and classification figures that attempted to detain 20% of the KPA captured personnel whose homes were in our side's area and 68% of the CPV captured personnel. The rough repatriation number you proposed is still close to the 70,000 you proposed on April 19th, and far from the approximate figure of 116,000 that you yourselves admitted should be repatriated. The classification principle you proposed fundamentally violated our side's proposed classification principle based on nationality and region to fully repatriate POWs held by both sides in order to guarantee returning home and living peaceful lives. Moreover, the classification figures you proposed contain your side's ulterior motives of instigation, which our side absolutely cannot tolerate.

	The joint consultation method you proposed for your so-called "non-repatriates" is actually an attempt to make our side recognize the results of your so-called "screening," and to require our side to violate the clear provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention on POWs and conduct so-called "re-screening" of POWs together with your side. Therefore, your side's unilateral and unreasonable plan on July 13th is absolutely unacceptable to our side.

	Our side firmly believes that as long as the list re-corrected by your side is a realistic figure derived based on the classification principle of nationality and region, close to the 116,000 including 20,000 CPV captured personnel, the POW issue can be resolved and the Korean armistice can be achieved.

	Our side has made every possible effort to reasonably resolve the POW issue. However, in recent days, your side has violated the principles of Articles 51 and 52 in the administrative meetings, insisted on the proposition of so-called "non-forcible repatriation," which is actually forcibly detaining our side's POWs, reneged on the statement that any solution must reasonably meet the requirements of both sides, and publicly stated that your side's unreasonable repatriation proposition is "firm, final, and unchangeable." Your side is conducting狂轰滥炸outside the meetings, attempting to exert so-called military pressure on us and force us to accept your side's unilateral and unreasonable propositions, which will absolutely not succeed. Inside the meetings, your side has recently overturned its expressed willingness to negotiate and fundamentally refused to engage in any discussion, rendering the administrative meeting useless. Therefore, our side proposes that from July 26th, the delegations of both sides end the administrative meeting and enter into open discussions. In order to accelerate the completion of the draft armistice agreement, our side also proposes that while the delegations of both sides enter into open meetings, a meeting of staff officers from both sides be convened to discuss the detailed wording of the armistice agreement.

    美方推翻愿意协商的表示并根本拒绝讨论
    我方提议结束行政性会议
    南日将军斥责美方出尔反尔的无理态度并重申我方立场
    【新华社开城二十五日电】由于朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会行政性会议中，美方推翻了愿意进行协商的表示，连日以来根本拒绝进行任何讨论，以致使行政性会议失去了任何有效的作用。我方首席代表南日将军在二十五日的会上，提议结束行政性会议，双方代表团大会自二十六日起进入公开讨论。为了加速停战协定草案的准备工作，我方并建议同时召开双方参谋人员会议，讨论停战协定的文字细节问题。美方表示同意结束行政性会议，声称：将考虑我方关于召开参谋人员会议的建议。南日将军在二十五日的会上扼要地斥责了对方在行政性会议上出尔反尔的横蛮无理态度，重申我方在遣俘问题上的公平合理的立场。南日将军发言全文
    你方在七月一日放弃了你方两个月来拒绝协商的态度，表示愿意对于在朝鲜停战谈判中唯一剩余的战俘遣返问题，寻求“一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，并提出了停战协定草案第五十一款关于释放和遣返双方所收容的全部战俘的原则，为解决战俘遣返问题的基础。虽然在同一日的发言中，你方仍然声称：在你方收容下的战俘中有的人你方不能将他们送回我方，而这是我方所绝对不能同意的。但本着我方协商解决问题达成朝鲜停战的一贯立场，对于你方愿意进行协商的态度，我方表示了欢迎。
    我方建议根据双方所同意的第五十一款及第五十二款保证双方全体战俘在遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争以便回家过和平生活的原则，应按照国籍和地区对双方战俘进行重新分类，并校正一九五一年十二月十八日双方交换的战俘名单。为了实事求是地解决问题，我方并建议双方代表团大会进入行政性会议。
    由于双方已经同意了停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款的规定，因此，双方所俘获的朝鲜籍武装人员，即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，只有家在收容一方地区者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返，而双方所俘获的外国武装人员，即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，没有任何理由不予全部遣返回家过和平生活。本此原则，我方认为你方重新校正的名单，应该是一个接近于你方自己所承认的十一万六千人的近似数字，并包括两万名中国人民志愿军战俘在内。
    你方在七月十三日提出了八万三千人的遣俘概数和企图扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军家在我方地区的被俘人员和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的分类数字。你方所提出的这个遣俘概数，仍然和你方四月十九日提出的七万概数相近，而和你方自己所承认的应予遣返的近似数字十一万六千人相距甚远。你方所提出的分类原则，更根本违反了我方所提的按照国籍和地区的分类原则来全部遣返双方所收容的战俘，以保证回家过和平生活。而你方所提出的分类数字，更包藏着你方不可告人的挑拨阴谋，为我方所绝对不能容忍。
    你方所提出的对于你方所谓“非被遣返者”进行联合征询的办法，实际上更是企图使我方承认你方所谓“甄别”的结果，要求我方违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约的明确规定，同你方一起对战俘进行所谓“再甄别”。因此，你方七月十三日的片面无理的方案是我方所绝对不能接受的。
    我方坚决认为：只要你方重新校正的名单是按照国籍和地区的分类原则而得出的一个切合实际并接近十一万六千人之中包括中国人民志愿军两万被俘人员在内的数字，遣俘问题即可解决，朝鲜停战即可实现。
    为了合理解决遣俘问题，我方已经作了一切可能的努力。但你方连日以来，在行政性会议上违反了第五十一款和第五十二款的原则，坚持所谓“不能强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留我方战俘的主张，背弃了任何解决方案必须在合理程度上适合双方要求的声明，并且公然声称你方这一无理的遣俘主张，又是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”。你方在会外进行狂轰滥炸，妄图对我施行所谓军事压力，强使我方接受你方片面的无理主张，这是绝对不能成功的。在会内你方最近更推翻了愿意进行协商的表示，根本拒绝进行任何讨论，使行政性会议失去任何有用的目的。为此，我方提议自七月二十六日起，双方代表团大会结束行政性会议，进入公开讨论。为了加速完成停战协定草案的准备工作，我方并提议在双方代表团大会进入公开会议的同时，召开双方参谋人员会议，讨论停战协定条文的细节问题。
