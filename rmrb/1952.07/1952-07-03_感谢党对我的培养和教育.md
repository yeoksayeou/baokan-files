    Thanking the Party for its Cultivation and Education
    Industrial Labor Model Hao Jianxiu
    The Chinese Communist Party's education and cultivation of me is even better than that of my own parents. As I commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Party's founding, I deeply feel this.
    When I started working, the Party educated me, making me realize the broad prospects of the working class, and encouraged me to create achievements in my work. Afterwards, the Party sent people to help me summarize my work and create a set of fine yarn working methods, enabling me to make a small contribution to the motherland.
    Although my contribution is very small, the Party has given me extremely great honor.
    Last National Day, I gloriously participated in the National Day celebrations in Beijing and saw Chairman Mao. The night before last year's National Day, Chairman Mao invited us to dinner, and I, on behalf of the labor models of East China, toasted him. This was truly the happiest and most unforgettable day of my life. On October 1st, I was able to stand in front of Tiananmen Square and celebrate the great National Day with Chairman Mao. This is the greatest honor of my life.
    Later, I also attended the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I attended meetings with Chairman Mao and other leaders. At the meeting, I personally heard Chairman Mao call on all the people of the country to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    In order to further educate and cultivate me, the Party sent me to the Soviet Union this year on behalf of the Chinese working class to participate in the May Day International Labor Day celebrations. During this visit to the Soviet Union, I personally witnessed the great construction of the Soviet socialist country and gained a lot of knowledge. I saw the Soviet working people's spirit of loving labor and cherishing national property, which gave me a great education. I saw the happy lives of the Soviet working people, which also gave me great encouragement. We must build our motherland as happily as the Soviet Union. What made me even more excited was that on May Day, I saw the leader and teacher of the working people of the world—Stalin.
    In order to educate me, cultivate me, and improve my culture and technology, the Party has allowed me to study culture one day and technology one day since February this year, and also sent someone to help me.
    The Party has not only educated and cultivated me, but also educated and cultivated the entire working class and the broad masses of the people. When I returned to the factory from the Soviet Union this time, I saw that many of my partners had been promoted to leading cadres. This is something that would never have happened in the old society!
    As I commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Party's founding, I deeply feel the Party's greatness, glory, and correctness. Over the past 31 years, the Party has been leading the working people of the country to strive for liberation and build a happy life. I have personally seen our motherland, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, advancing rapidly day by day, becoming richer and stronger day by day, which has given me infinite confidence and strength.
    As I commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Party's founding, I deeply thank the Party for its education and cultivation of me. I am now a member of the Communist Youth League, and in the future, I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn well from Party members and veteran workers, improve my political, cultural, and technical level, and complete the learning tasks assigned to me by the Party, so that I can do more work for the people in the future.

    感谢党对我的培养和教育
    工业劳动模范  郝建秀
    中国共产党对我的教育和培养，比亲生父母还好。在纪念党成立三十一周年的时候，我深刻地体会到了这一点。
    在我开始作工的时候，党就对我进行了教育，使我认识到了工人阶级的远大前途，并鼓励我在工作中创造成绩。随后党又派人帮助我总结工作，创造了一套细纱工作法，使我对祖国有了一点贡献。
    虽然我的贡献很小，可是党却给了我极大的荣誉。
    去年国庆节，我光荣地参加了北京庆祝国庆典礼，见到了毛主席。去年国庆节前一天的晚上，毛主席请我们吃饭，我代表华东的劳动模范向他敬酒，这真是我一生最幸福、最难忘的一天。十月一日，我能够站在天安门前，和毛主席一起来庆祝伟大的国庆节，是我一生最大的光荣。
    后来，我又列席了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，我和毛主席及其他首长一起开会。在会上，我亲自听到毛主席号召我们全国人民开展增产节约运动，支持中国人民志愿军。
    党为了进一步教育我，培养我，今年又让我代表中国工人阶级，去苏联参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼。这次到苏联，我亲眼看到苏联社会主义国家的伟大建设，增加了许多知识。我看到苏联劳动人民热爱劳动和爱护国家资财的精神，给我很大的教育。我看到苏联劳动人民的幸福生活，也给我很大的鼓励。我们要把祖国建设得像苏联那样幸福。更让我兴奋的，就是在“五一”那天，我看到了全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师——斯大林。
    党为了教育我，培养我，提高我的文化和技术，从今年二月开始，就让我一天学文化，一天学技术，还派了专人来帮助我。
    党不光对我进行了教育和培养，对整个工人阶级和广大人民也都进行了教育和培养。我这次从苏联回到工厂，看到我的许多伙伴都已经被提拔当了领导干部。这真是旧社会永远也不会有的事啊！
    在纪念党成立三十一周年的时候，我深深感到党的伟大、光荣和正确。党在三十一年中，一直领导我们全国劳动人民争取解放和建设幸福的生活。我亲眼看到我们的祖国，在党和毛主席英明的领导下，一天天飞快地前进，一天天富强壮大，使我产生了无限的信心和力量。
    在纪念党成立三十一周年的时候，我深深感谢党对我的教育和培养。我现在是一个青年团员，我今后一定要听毛主席的话，好好向党员、老工人学习，提高我的政治、文化和技术水平，完成党交给我的学习任务，以便将来为人民做更多的工作。
