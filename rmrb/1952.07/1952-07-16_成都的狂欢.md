In this celebration of the full line opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, newcomers to Chengdu were deeply moved by the fiery enthusiasm of Chengdu's people, young and old.

The CPC's (Communist Party of China) Western Sichuan District Committee, the Chengdu Municipal Committee, the Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office, and the Chengdu Municipal People's Government all regarded the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as a major political event and treated the organization of this celebration as a political task. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of Chengdu warmly celebrated this day they had longed for for fifty years. Before July 1st, the people of Chengdu had paved the roads, cleaned the streets, and built a square outside the North Gate station that could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people. They also built a wide and smooth road from this square to the city center. On the eve of the opening, the streets and alleys showed a prosperous atmosphere. The floral fabrics in department stores were snapped up by women, and tailors and flag shops were working day and night. All the hotels were filled with people who had come from the Western Sichuan Plain to celebrate.

From midnight on June 30th, the masses began to walk towards the North Gate station, singing, dancing, and reveling all night. By dawn on July 1st, 300,000 people had gathered in the square. In the vast green field, the flags as red as a forest and the brightly colored costumes dyed the entire square into a colorful world. When the train left the station, 300,000 people applauded and cheered, shaking this city known for its tranquility and elegance.

The people of Chengdu love the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the guests from Chongqing. From July 2nd to 4th, they gave the 600 guests from Chongqing the warmest hospitality. The opening of the railway was a celebration and handshake between the two major cities, strengthening their friendship. They were not only welcoming their dear friends from Chongqing, but also celebrating the prosperity and strength of the motherland.

The children of Chengdu are especially lovely these days. They regard the people who came by train as relatives, throwing paper flowers at the guests, eagerly offering flowers, holding the guests' hands and not letting go, and asking good questions innocently. When the guests went to Guanxian to visit China's famous Dujiangyan irrigation project, they encountered groups of Young Pioneers who kept asking: "Have the Soviet experts arrived?" They deeply appreciate the contribution of the Soviet experts to the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

Chengdu is a city with beautiful scenery, full of trees, flowers, and flowing water. People who come here feel like they have entered a garden. The Chengdu Plain stretches for hundreds of miles, filled with endless rice fields. A year's harvest is enough to eat for several years. In the past, people used to say: Chengdu is a good place, but it lacks coal, salt, industrial equipment, and a railway. The people of Chengdu have been longing for a railway for decades.

In the beautiful People's Park (formerly Shaocheng Park), there stands a towering square stone monument, eleven zhang high. The four sides of the monument are engraved with large characters: "Monument to the Martyrs Who Died for the Railway Protection Movement in the Autumn of Xinhai." Below the characters are carved images of locomotives, tracks, sleepers, and car couplings. This monument is a forever indelible glorious achievement of the people of Chengdu's bloody struggle for the railway.

The fact is this: From 1903, the people of Sichuan raised funds to build a railway from Chengdu to Hankou. By 1911, the year of Xinhai, the Qing emperor suddenly "nationalized" this people's property for building the railway. The people of Sichuan launched a strong protest. The people of Chengdu were the initiators of this road rights protection movement, staging demonstrations, petitions, strikes, market boycotts, resistance to grain taxes, and resistance to taxes. Zhao Erfeng, the Qing Dynasty's Governor-General of Sichuan, opened fire on the demonstrating masses, killing and wounding more than 30 people. A month later, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and the Qing government finally collapsed.

It is not difficult to understand why the people of Chengdu are so enthusiastic and excited now that they have personally seen the railway and the train, because this is not an ordinary festival, but the arrival of a happy life that they have longed for for decades.

The people of Chengdu are vying to contribute everything to celebrate the beginning of happiness. More than a thousand farmers outside the North Gate voluntarily relocated to build a large station here. Farmers near Chengdu organized road protection teams. Farmers in the Fourth and Fifth Villages of Jintang Renhe Township even had a dispute over this. The farmers of the Fourth Village said, we have more people and can take on the task, so you don't need to contribute. The farmers of the Fifth Village were not convinced and organized more than a hundred people to stand by the railway in order to see the train come and go every day.

Since the end of June, thousands of people have been coming to visit the railway near the North Gate station in Chengdu every day. Although many news and photos about the railway have been published in the newspapers, everyone still feels that they cannot satisfy their demands and must see it for themselves. Many wheelbarrow workers in western Sichuan, pushing heavy goods, do not go directly to their destinations, but detour dozens of miles through Chengdu in order to see the railway. In Wenchuan County, a remote mountainous area in western Sichuan, a 75-year-old man named Wang Ruizhen came to Chengdu. He touched the rails with both hands like caressing a loved one, and said excitedly: "I paid forty taels of silver for the railway forty years ago, and I didn't even see the shadow of the railway. Now I haven't paid half a cent, but the train has come to my doorstep." Let us also listen to what an old woman, Zhang Xiuzhen, said. She is from Huayang County and came to Chengdu to stay at her aunt's house especially for the railway. She said: "When I was a girl, I heard that a railway was going to be built. Later, I got married and had children, but I didn't know what a railway looked like. Now my daughter is almost fifty years old, and I thought I would never see a train in my life. It is really thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership that I, who am about to die, have finally fulfilled a wish." This noble joy infected everyone. Many professors at West China University and Sichuan University have been to various parts of the country and even abroad. Trains are not unfamiliar to them, but many of them also carried water bottles and dry food and walked more than ten miles to the railway to see the train. Why is this? The professors who are undergoing ideological reform are learning from the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as a political lesson. From here, they have learned to despise the reactionary rulers of modern times and have strengthened their love for the people's motherland and the Communist Party. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has greatly strengthened people's patriotic ideology.

The people of Chengdu are now looking forward to the happiness that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will bring to the people's economic life. From now on, they will not only be able to burn cheap coal and use cheap cotton fabrics, but also build huge factories in the city and transform a consumer city into a production city. Now, Chengdu's economic life is facing a new era. National economic authorities are formulating long-term economic development plans based on the new situation of transportation development. Businessmen and industrialists feel that they must start from scratch. They are calculating the huge difference between train freight and car and wooden boat freight, and are determined to reduce the cost of goods. The owner of a sack factory is determined to produce high-quality sacks, because he has the convenience of importing machines to expand the factory. Merchants of medicinal materials from Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and various provinces have recently gathered in Chengdu and have purchased a large amount of medicinal materials. Now, Chengdu is busy welcoming the arrival of a new era.

### 成都的狂欢

    成都的狂欢
    在这次成渝铁路全线通车典礼中，初到成都的人都为成都男女老少所流露出来的热得像一团火一样的心情所深深感动。
    中国共产党川西区党委、成都市委和川西人民行政公署、成都市人民政府都把这次成渝铁路通车当作重大的政治事件，把组织这次通车作为政治任务看待。在党和人民政府领导下，成都人民热烈地庆贺这五十年来渴望的日子。七月一日以前，成都人民就铺平了马路，打扫了街道，在北门的车站外面修了一所可容数十万人的广场，又从这广场修一条又宽大又平坦的马路到城内。通车前夕，大街小巷都显现出繁荣的气象，百货商店的花布都被妇女争购一空，大小成衣店和制旗商店都是日夜加工，所有旅店都住满了从川西平原赶来祝捷的人们。
    六月三十日午夜起，群众就先后向北门外车站走去，唱着、舞着，狂欢通宵。一直到七月一日黎明，三十万群众都汇集在广场上。在广阔的绿色的平场上，鲜红如林的旗帜，鲜艳夺目的服装，把整个广场染成了一片彩色的世界。当列车出站时，三十万人鼓掌欢呼，撼动了这个以宁静幽雅称著的城市。
    成都人民热爱成渝铁路，也热爱重庆的来宾，从七月二日到四日，他们对重庆六百个来宾作了最热情的款待。这次铁路通车是两大城市的联欢和握手，加强了两大城市的友谊，他们不仅是欢迎亲爱的重庆朋友，而且是庆贺祖国的繁荣和昌盛。
    成都的儿童这些日子分外可爱。他们把坐火车来的人看作亲人，向来宾们投掷纸花，忙献鲜花，握住来宾们的手不放，天真地问好。来宾们到灌县去参观我国著名都江堰水利工程，碰到成群的少年儿童队，他们不断地问：“苏联专家来了没有？”他们深深感谢苏联专家对修建成渝铁路的贡献。
    成都是风景秀丽的城市，到处是树木、花草、流水，到了这里的人就如进了花园。成都平原纵横数百里，尽是一望无际的稻田，一年的丰收，就可以吃好几年，往年人们都说：成都是一个好地方，就只缺煤、缺盐、缺工业器材和缺少一条铁路。成都人民几十年来就一直渴望着一条铁路。
    在幽美的人民公园（原少城公园）里，巍然矗立着一座高达十一丈的方形石碑，石碑的四面刻着斗大的字：“辛亥秋保路死事纪念碑”，字的下面雕着火车头、轨道、枕木和车箱挂钩的图样，这座石碑是成都人民为铁路而进行过流血斗争的永远不可磨灭的光荣业绩。
    事实是这样：从一九零三年起，四川人民就筹款准备修建一条由成都到汉口的铁路，到了一九一一年，就是辛亥年，满清皇帝突然把这笔修筑铁路的人民财产“收归国有”，四川人民发动了坚强的抗议，成都人民是这次保障路权事件的发难者，示威、请愿、罢课、罢市、抗粮、抗税，满清王朝四川总督赵尔丰，向示威的群众开枪，打死打伤了三十多人。一个月后，辛亥革命起，满清政府终于倒台。
    人们不难理解，为什么成都人民现在亲眼看到了铁路和火车之后，是如此狂热，如此激动，因为这不是一个普通的节日，而是想望了几十年的幸福生活的来临。
    成都人民为了庆贺幸福的开始，争着贡献出一切。北门外的一千多户农民自动迁移，以便在这里建设大型的车站。成都附近农民组织起护路队。金堂人和乡第四村和第五村的农民还为此发生了争执。第四村的农民说，我们人多，能包下，不用你们出力。第五村的农民不服气，组织了一百多人到铁路边站起来，为的是可以天天看见火车来去。
    从六月底起，成都北门外车站附近，每天都有成千上万的群众络绎不绝地来参观铁路。虽然报上刊载了许多关于这条铁路的消息和照片，但大家始终觉得满足不了自己的要求，必须亲自来看看才行。川西许多推独轮车的工人，推着沉重的货物，却不迳直运到目的地，而要绕道几十里经过成都，为的是要看看铁路。在川西深山中的汶川县，有一个七十五岁的老人王瑞珍来到成都，他像抚摸亲人似的用双手在铁轨上摸了又摸，他激动地说：“我在四十年前为铁路出过四十两银子，连铁路的影子也没见，现在我连半分银子也没出，火车却到了跟前。”让我们再听一个老太婆张秀贞的话吧，她是华阳县人，她特地为着铁路来住到成都的姨妈家里，她说：“我当姑娘的时候就听说要修铁路，后来我出嫁了，生儿育女了，也不晓得铁路是个啥样子，现在我的女儿也快五十岁了，我以为这一辈子再也看不见火车，硬是毛主席领导得好，我这快死的人也遂了一场心愿了。”这种高贵的喜悦感染了所有的人们。华西大学和四川大学的许多教授，是到过国内各地甚至到过外国的，火车对他们不是陌生的事物，但是他们许多人也提着水壶，带着干粮，步行十多里，走到铁路边看火车，这是为什么呢？正在进行思想改造的教授们，把成渝铁路通车当作一场政治课来学习，他们从这里学到了对近代反动统治者的轻蔑，更加强了对人民祖国和共产党的热爱，成渝铁路大大加强了人们的爱国主义思想。
    成都人民现在正期待着成渝铁路给人民经济生活带来的幸福，从此不仅可以烧廉价的煤，使用廉价的棉织品，而且还将在城市里建筑巨大的工厂，把一个消费城市改变成为生产城市。现在，成都的经济生活正面临着一个新时代，国家经济机关正在根据交通发展的新情况拟订长远的经济发展计划，工商业家们感到还须从头作起，他们盘算火车运费和汽车、木船运费的巨大差额，决定降低货物的成本。一个麻袋厂的老板决心出产品质兼优的麻袋，因为他有了输入机器扩充工厂的便利条件。上海、天津、广州和各省的药材商人新近麕集成都，已收购了大批药材。现在，成都为迎接一个新时代的到来而忙碌着。
