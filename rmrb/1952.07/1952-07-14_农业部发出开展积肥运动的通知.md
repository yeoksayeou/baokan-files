    Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: In order to vigorously promote the manure accumulation campaign to ensure the realization of the plan to increase yield per unit area, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a notice on July 10th on carrying out the manure accumulation campaign. The notice stated:

    In this year's agricultural production increase campaign, the amount of manure accumulated and applied has generally increased in all parts of the country. In some areas, due to the importance attached by the leadership, manure accumulation work has formed a regular movement. For example, in the Northeast region, where there was no habit of fertilization in the past, the manure accumulation work has achieved remarkable results under the inspection and supervision of the people's governments at all levels. For example, in Songjiang Province, the area of fertilization this year has expanded by 82% compared with last year and 225% compared with 1950. Another example is Xiapu Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, where the average application of fertilizer was only 16 dan per mu. After the manure accumulation and fertilization campaign, the average increased to more than 100 dan per mu. However, in terms of the national requirements for high yield, the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland is still far from sufficient, and the existing commercial fertilizers can only serve as supplementary fertilizers in terms of supply quantity and improvement of soil fertility and soil structure. Therefore, the main way to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer for the vast number of peasants is to rely on farm manure; this huge potential force must be well explored and utilized. However, the leadership in a few areas still does not pay attention to manure accumulation work, thinking that the peasants will accumulate manure themselves and do not need leadership; or that farm manure has been utilized to the top and cannot be further increased, and that increasing fertilizer must rely on commercial fertilizers. For example, in District 1 of Hua'an County, Fujian Province, due to the leadership's lack of attention to manure accumulation, more than 60% of the district's peasants planted white water seedlings this year.

    In order to increase the application of fertilizer to realize the plan of increasing yield per unit area, it is necessary to launch a manure accumulation campaign throughout the country. Therefore, the following opinions are put forward for reference in carrying out the manure accumulation campaign in various places:

    1.  At present, the most effective method of manure accumulation is raising pigs, and the pig raising and manure accumulation campaign should be vigorously carried out. In areas where pigs are not raised in pens, peasants should be educated to build pens for raising pigs; and wild grass, leaves, garbage, soil, etc. should be used to line the pens regularly to absorb manure and urine and accumulate a large amount of manure. In areas where there are few or no pigs, propaganda on pig raising and manure accumulation must be strengthened, peasants should be mobilized to formulate specific pig raising plans, and great efforts should be made to help peasants solve the supply of piglets, as well as the sales of live pigs and the prevention and control of swine fever.

    2.  Cultivation of green manure. Green manure is of great significance for improving soil, and the promotion and popularization of green manure crops should be emphasized. In areas suitable for planting green manure crops, plans must be formulated to expand the area of green manure planting, specific arrangements should be made among peasants, and preparations should be made as soon as possible for the green manure seeds needed in autumn. Green manure is best made of leguminous crops, its root nodules can fertilize the field, and it should produce more stems and leaves to be used as green manure. Therefore, sowing must be dense. In some areas that are not accustomed to using non-leguminous crops, leguminous crops suitable for local growth should also be gradually adopted according to local conditions.

    3.  The current season is the peak growing season for various weeds, and various weeds are good materials for composting manure. If wild leguminous plants and Artemisia species can be used, the fertilizer effect will be greater. The leading organs in various places must seize the opportunity to mobilize peasants to cut green grass for manure composting in summer and autumn, and correct the habit of scraping turf in winter and spring to prevent soil erosion. In composting, more attention should be paid to improving the composting method to prevent fertilizer from volatilizing and rainwater from washing away.

    4.  All localities must pay attention to the use of city manure and do a good job of city manure going to the countryside in an organized manner. In addition, attention should also be paid to the use of urban garbage and sludge from sewers, which contain a lot of rich nutrients for fertilizing fields. All localities should use slack farming seasons to organize suburban peasants to enter the city to transport garbage and dig ditch mud. This will not only increase the source of fertilizer, but also improve urban environmental sanitation.

    The key to doing a good job in manure accumulation lies in the attention of the leadership. Past experience has fully proved that areas that do not pay attention to manure accumulation work, or only stay at general appeals, will become a mere formality. Therefore, to carry out manure accumulation work, we should first strengthen organizational leadership, designate special personnel at all levels to be responsible, organize cadres to go deep into the countryside to carry out extensive publicity, provide specific technical guidance, and mobilize peasants to formulate plans. Launch manure accumulation competitions and pay attention to timely summarizing and popularizing good experiences. The leading organs in various places should pay special attention to the fact that manure accumulation work is one of the regular tasks of agricultural production, and should be summarized and reported regularly, commended, and the manure accumulation campaign should be vigorously carried out.

### 农业部发出开展积肥运动的通知

    农业部发出开展积肥运动的通知
    【新华社十三日讯】为大力开展积肥运动，以保证实现提高单位面积产量的计划，中央人民政府农业部于七月十日发出了开展积肥运动的通知，通知称：
    今年的农业增产运动中，全国各地积肥施肥数量都普遍提高，有些地区由于领导方面重视，积肥工作已形成一个经常性的运动。如过去没有施肥习惯的东北区，各地农民在各级人民政府的检查、督促下，积肥工作已获得了显著成绩。如松江省今年施肥面积比去年扩大了百分之八十二，比一九五○年扩大百分之二百二十五。再如湖南衡山县夏浦乡原来每亩平均仅施肥料十六担，经过开展积肥施肥运动后，每亩平均增加到一百多担。但就全国的丰产要求来看，目前农田所施肥料还十分不足，而现有商品肥料在供应数量上和对提高地力、改良土壤结构来说，只能充作补助肥料。因此解决广大农民肥料不足的问题，主要是依靠农家肥料；必须很好地发掘和发挥这个巨大的潜在力量。但有少数地区的领导方面，仍不重视积肥工作，认为农民自己会积肥，用不着领导；或认为农家肥料已利用到顶，不能再有提高，增加肥料必须依靠商品肥料。如福建华安县一区，由于领导方面不重视积肥，今年该区农民插白水秧的竟达百分之六十以上。
    为了增施肥料，以实现提高单位面积产量的计划，在全国范围内普遍地展开一个积肥运动是十分必要的。因此，特提出下列意见，供各地开展积肥运动的参考：
    一、目前积肥最有效的方法就是养猪，应该大力开展养猪积肥运动。养猪不修圈地区，应该教育农民做到养猪必须修圈；并要经常利用野草、树叶、垃圾、泥土等垫圈，吸收粪尿，大量积肥。在养猪少或不养猪地区，必须加强养猪积肥宣传，发动农民订出具体的养猪计划，并要大力协助农民解决仔猪供应问题，以及生猪销路和防治猪瘟等问题。
    二、栽培绿肥。绿肥对改良土壤有重要的意义，应该重视提倡和推广绿肥作物。凡适合种植绿肥作物的地区，必须拟订扩大绿肥种植面积的计划，在农民中进行具体布置，及早准备秋季所需绿肥种籽。绿肥最好是用豆科作物，它的根瘤可以肥田，而且要使它多产些茎叶充作绿肥。因此播种就须稠密。在一些不习惯用非豆科作物的地区，也应根据当地具体情况逐渐改用适合当地生长的豆科作物。
    三、当前正是各种杂草生长的旺盛季节，各种杂草都是沤制堆肥的好材料，如能利用野生豆科植物与蒿类，肥效更大。各地领导机关必须抓紧时机发动农民在夏秋两季进行割青草沤粪，纠正在冬春两季刮草皮的习惯，以防止土壤冲刷。在堆制中，更应注意改进沤制方法，防止肥分挥发及雨水冲淋。
    四、各地必须注意利用城粪，有组织地做好城粪下乡工作。此外，还应注意利用城市的垃圾及下水道的污泥，这些淤泥里含有很多丰富的肥田养分。各地应利用农闲组织郊区农民进城运垃圾、挖沟泥。这不仅能增加了肥料来源，并能做好城市的环境卫生。
    做好积肥工作，主要关键在于领导方面的重视。过去经验已充分证明，凡不重视积肥工作，或只停留于一般号召地区，就要流于形式。因此开展积肥工作，首先应该加强组织领导，逐级指定专人负责，组织干部深入农村广泛宣传，具体进行技术指导，发动农民订出计划。展开积肥竞赛并要注意及时总结和推广好的经验。各地领导机关尤应注意，积肥工作是农业生产经常工作之一，应按期总结，通报表扬，把积肥运动大力开展起来。
