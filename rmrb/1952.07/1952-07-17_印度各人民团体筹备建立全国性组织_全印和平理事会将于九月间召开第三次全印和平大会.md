Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th—India's people's movement to defend peace is developing on the basis of strengthening unity among various people's organizations. Indian trade unions, farmers' associations, women's and student organizations have recently passed resolutions to strengthen unity to defend peace.

    The All-India Trade Union Congress held an All-India Trade Union Conference in Calcutta on May 24th and 25th. The conference passed an important resolution on unifying Indian trade unions. Since the end of the conference, many trade unions that had not originally participated in any central trade union organization, as well as trade unions that originally participated in other central trade union organizations, have decided to join the All-India Trade Union Congress. At present, the next step in the Indian trade union movement is to establish unified trade unions in different industries and hold joint trade union conferences in various provinces.

    The Central Council of the All-India Farmers' Association held a meeting in Patna from June 23rd to 25th and passed important resolutions, including the establishment of a consultation committee to promote the merger of two farmers' organizations—the United Farmers' Association and the All-India Farmers' Association. These two farmers' organizations are taking the necessary steps to implement the merger. The All-India Farmers' Association has decided to hold a meeting of the Central Council in Hyderabad in August.

    Although there is no national democratic women's organization in India at present, the united front movement of the women's movement is also progressing. In Calcutta, a Unified Women's Committee has been established, with the participation of women workers' leaders from various progressive democratic parties and well-known non-partisan women workers.

    The Working Committee of the All-India Students' Federation held a meeting in Madras from June 14th to 21st, drafted a program statement of work, and prepared to submit it for adoption at the annual meeting of the All-India Students' Federation to be held in Hyderabad in December. The statement stated that the main task of the All-India Students' Federation will be to promote and strengthen student unity.

    The All-India Peace Council has decided to hold the next Third All-India Peace Conference in East Punjab Province in September. The preparations for the next conference will be combined with the preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. Before the All-India Peace Conference is held, peace committees in various provinces and counties across India will hold meetings. Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving people in India, the next session of the All-India Peace Conference will become an unprecedented review of India's peace forces.

    印度各人民团体筹备建立全国性组织
    全印和平理事会将于九月间召开第三次全印和平大会
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度人民保卫和平的运动，正在各人民团体加强团结的基础上发展中。印度各工会、农民协会、妇女及学生组织，最近都通过了加强团结以保卫和平的决议。
    全印工会大会曾于五月二十四日和二十五日在加尔各答召开全印工会会议。会议通过了关于统一印度各工会的重要决议。会议结束以后，有许多本来未参加任何中央工会组织的工会，以及原来参加其他中央工会组织的工会，已经决定加入全印工会大会。目前，印度工会运动的下一步骤为成立不同行业的统一工会并举行各省工会联合会议。
    全印农民协会中央理事会曾于六月二十三日至二十五日在巴特那举行会议，通过重要决议，其中包括成立一个为促进两个农民组织——统一农民协会和全印农民协会——实行合并的协商委员会。这两个农会组织正采取实行合并的必要步骤。全印农民协会已决定于八月间在海得拉巴举行中央理事会会议。
    目前印度虽还没有全国性的民主妇女组织，但妇女运动的统一战线运动也正在进展中。在加尔各答，已经成立了统一妇女委员会，参加的有各进步民主党派的妇女工作者领袖和著名的无党派妇女工作者。
    全印学生联合会工作委员会曾于六月十四日至二十一日在马德拉斯举行会议，草拟了工作方案声明，准备于十二月间在海得拉巴举行的全印学生联合会年会上提出通过。声明表示，全印学生联合会的主要任务，将是促进并加强学生的团结。
    全印和平理事会已决定于九月间在东旁遮普省举行下届第三次全印和平大会。关于下届大会的准备工作，将和在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的准备工作结合进行。在举行全印和平大会之前，印度全国各省、各县的和平委员会都将举行会议。由于爱好和平的印度人民的努力，全印和平大会的下届会议，行将成为规模空前的印度和平力量的检阅。
