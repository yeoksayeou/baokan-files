    Gaolei Grain Sub-branch Should Emphasize Storage Work
    Editor: The Gaolei Grain Sub-branch in Guangdong Province, due to dereliction of duty by cadres and poor storage, has resulted in the spoilage of over 14.4 million jin of stored grain. Of this, over 4.44 million jin are severely deteriorated, turning yellow and sour. The warehouses under the sub-branch, with the exception of a few that are clean inside and out, are generally filthy, covered in cobwebs, with grain piles in disarray, and sacks and canvas tarps scattered haphazardly. For example, the Chikan First Sales Department has 50-60 jin of bottom grain that has deteriorated and become moldy, and one rainproof canvas tarp has rotted into several pieces, while five white canvas tarps have grown green mold, but no one cares. The phenomenon of grain infestation is also common in the sub-branch. For example, the Xiang rice stored in the sub-branch contains 200 to 1,000 weevil larvae and rice weevils per jin. In the grain warehouses of the third warehouse under the sub-branch, which stores 1.6 million jin of Xiang rice, insect powder is everywhere. Upon entering the warehouse, one can hear the rustling of insects.

    The main reasons for the Gaolei Grain Sub-branch's spoilage of grain are the bureaucratic tendencies of the leading cadres, their lack of attention to the superior's grain protection instructions, which they kept in their pockets and drawers. In addition, they usually do not pay attention to work inspections, and only rely on superiors to solve problems when they encounter difficulties. Furthermore, the chaos of the system, lax management, abandonment of ideological leadership over cadres, and neglect of organizational work have caused the phenomenon of grain infestation and spoilage to become increasingly serious. The attitude of the leading cadres of the sub-branch, who do not cherish the people's property, is intolerable and should be immediately investigated and publicly criticized.

    高雷粮食分公司应重视保管工作
    编辑同志：广东省高雷粮食分公司，由于干部失职，保管不善，以致存粮一千四百多万斤全部发热变质，其中较严重的四百四十多万斤已变黄发酸。该分公司所属仓库，除少数的内外都很清洁者外，一般都是肮脏不堪，蛛网密布，粮堆凌乱，麻袋、帆布随地乱抛。如赤坎第一门市部有地脚米五、六十斤已变质霉烂，防雨篷布一块已霉烂成数块，白色帆布五块也生了绿毛，但都无人过问，至于粮食生虫现象在该分公司也是普遍的。如该分公司所存湘米，每市斤竟有出尾米虫和米象二百只至一千只。分公司所属第三仓库所存一百六十万斤湘米的粮仓中，虫粉到处皆是，走进仓库就可听到虫蚀刷刷作响。
    高雷粮食分公司造成霉坏粮食的原因，主要是领导干部的官僚主义，对上级护粮指示不重视，把上级护粮指示扣压在荷包和抽屉中；再加平日不注意工作检查，碰到困难只有依赖上级解决。此外如制度混乱，管理不严，放弃对干部的思想领导，忽视组织工作，因此使粮食生虫霉坏现象日趋严重。该分公司领导干部这种不爱护人民财产的态度，是令人不能容忍的，应该立即检查并作公开检讨。
