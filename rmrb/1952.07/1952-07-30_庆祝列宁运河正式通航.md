    Celebrating the Official Opening of the Lenin Canal
    The Soviet Union's Volga-Don Canal, named after the great Lenin, officially opened on July 27th. This is a great victory for the Soviet people in their communist construction under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party.

    The Lenin Canal is the world's first communist construction project. Its completion demonstrates the infinite possibilities of developing productive forces and transforming nature under the socialist and communist systems. This canal connects the waterways of the entire European part of the Soviet Union into a single system, thereby strengthening and further facilitating the exchange of goods between socialist countries. By 1955, the volume of freight transported by waterways in the European part of the Soviet Union will increase sevenfold. At the same time, its irrigation system will irrigate and supply water to an area of 2.75 million hectares, which is almost equal to the entire area of Belgium. In addition, the electricity generated by the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Station will become an important factor in the transformation of nature and the electrification of agriculture in the vast surrounding areas. From this, one can see the great importance of the Lenin Canal for the further development of the Soviet national economy.

    The grand scale of the Lenin Canal project and the astonishing speed with which it was completed vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and the infinite creativity of the Soviet people. It is known that the Suez Canal took 35 years to build, the Panama Canal took 11 years, and the German Kiel Canal took 8 years, while the Lenin Canal was completed in only four years. During the construction process, Soviet technicians solved many difficult technical problems and made brilliant innovations. The dam of the world's largest artificial reservoir, the Tsimlyanskaya Reservoir, was built on sandy soil, and part of the dam body was built of sandy soil. This is the first time in the history of world water conservancy construction. This achievement of the Soviet people not only proves the great potential of the Soviet socialist economy and its science and technology have far exceeded the level of the capitalist world, but also serves as a shining example for other communist construction projects underway in the Soviet Union.

    The fact that the Soviet Union is engaged in large-scale peaceful construction for the benefit of the people stands in stark contrast to the fact that the living standards of the working people in imperialist countries are declining due to their frantic arms expansion and war preparations. For example, the American Mississippi River, which has huge transportation and irrigation benefits, often floods due to years of disrepair. The flood in 1951 alone displaced 500,000 people, leaving them homeless. The completion of the Soviet Lenin Canal fully embodies the Soviet Union's loyalty to the cause of peace and its concern for the well-being of mankind. This is undoubtedly a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are fighting to defend world peace and strive for a better life.

    We, the Chinese people, regard this great victory of the Soviet people as a victory for the cause of peace for mankind. We will draw experience and strength from the shining example of the Soviet people and forge ahead to build our great motherland.

### 庆祝列宁运河正式通航

    庆祝列宁运河正式通航
    以伟大的列宁命名的苏联伏尔加河——顿河运河，已在七月二十七日正式通航了。这是苏联人民在列宁——斯大林党领导下，在共产主义建设中所取得的一个伟大胜利。
    列宁运河是世界上第一个共产主义的建设工程，它的完成显示了人类在社会主义与共产主义制度下发展生产力和改造自然的无限可能性。这条运河使苏联整个欧洲部分的水道运输形成了一个单一的系统，从而加强和更加便利了社会主义国家的物资交流。苏联欧洲部分水道运输的货运量到一九五五年将增加到七倍。同时，它的灌溉系统，将使面积达二百七十五万公顷的土地得到灌溉和供水，这几乎等于比利时全国的面积。此外，齐姆良水电站所发出的电力，将成为它的周围广大地区改造自然和农业电气化的重要因素。由此人们可以看出列宁运河对于进一步发展苏联国民经济的极大重要性。
    列宁运河工程的宏大规模和完成这一工程的惊人速度，生动地表现了社会主义制度的优越性和苏联人民无穷的创造力。人们知道，苏彝士运河建造了三十五年，巴拿马运河建造了十一年，德国基尔运河也建造了八年，而列宁运河只四年就完成了。在建设过程中，苏联技术人员解决了许多困难的技术问题，有了辉煌的创造。世界上最大的人工水库——齐姆良水库的堤坝是在沙地上建筑起来的，并且一部分堤身是用沙土筑成的，这在世界水利建设史上还是第一次。苏联人民的这种成就不仅证明了苏联社会主义经济的伟大潜力和它的科学技术已远超过了资本主义世界的水平，并且对于苏联尚在进行中的其他共产主义建设工程也是一个光辉的示范。
    苏联从事造福人民的大规模和平建设的事实，和帝国主义国家由于进行疯狂的扩军备战而使劳动人民的生活水准日益下降的事实，适成鲜明的对比。例如有巨大的运输、灌溉之利的美国密士失比河，由于年久失修而常常泛滥成灾，仅一九五一年的一次水灾，就使五十万人流离失所，无家可归。苏联列宁运河的修建完成，充分地体现出苏联对和平事业 的忠诚和对于人类福祉的关怀。这对于正在为保卫世界和平、争取美好生活而斗争的各国人民，无疑地是一个极大的鼓舞。
    我们中国人民把苏联人民的这一伟大胜利，看作为人类和平事业的胜利。我们将从苏联人民的光辉榜样中汲取经验和力量，为建设我们伟大的祖国而奋勇前进。
