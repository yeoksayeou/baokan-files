    Suggestions to Relevant Departments on Resolving the Meat Shortage for Hui People
    Recently, we have received letters from Hui people and Hui affairs workers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Guihua, requesting the People's Government to help Hui people solve the problem of the lack of beef and mutton.
    Beef and mutton (especially beef) are the main meat for Hui people (and other ethnic groups who believe in Islam), but since the spring of this year, beef and mutton (especially beef) have been very scarce. A reader in Beijing wrote: "I am a Hui person and also a Hui affairs worker. Many Hui people often ask me: Why can't we often buy beef? To solve this problem, I have done some research. The number of cattle slaughtered in Beijing this year has decreased month by month. In April, the number of cattle slaughtered in the city was only 41% of that in March. The number of cattle slaughtered in April this year was only one-sixth of the same period last year. People's living standards are improving day by day, but the meat supply for Hui people is gradually decreasing. I hope you will be responsible for studying and suggesting that relevant departments solve this problem."
    Ma Kuan, a Hui person from Guihua, wrote: In Guihua and Baotou in Suiyuan Province, beef and mutton are very scarce due to the reduced supply of cattle and sheep. Last year, Guihua City's cattle and sheep slaughterhouses slaughtered nearly 100 cattle and more than 100 sheep each month; however, from January to June this year, a total of only sixty to seventy cattle and sheep were slaughtered.
    The reduction in the source of cattle and sheep has not only greatly reduced the business of cattle and sheep slaughtering, causing a shortage of meat for the Hui people, but also affected the catering industry, beef and mutton industry, tanning industry, raw leather industry, and dairy industry related to slaughtering. Several cattle and sheep businesses in Tianjin jointly wrote: If the government does not help solve the problem of cattle and sheep sources, we will lose our jobs. There are more than 1,000 cattle and sheep businesses in Tianjin, with thousands of workers, but in May, the city only slaughtered an average of eight cattle per day. How can we maintain production?
    The Hui people in these areas urgently request the government to solve this problem. Yang Bodi, a Hui person from Guihua, wrote: Since the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan Province, the Communist Party and the People's Government have helped us establish a Hui Autonomous Region, allowing us to control our own political power. Our lives are getting better and better every day. We are very satisfied with the government's policies in all aspects. But we ask the government to solve the problem of the lack of meat.
    After receiving these readers' letters, we immediately contacted the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and sent people to Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places to investigate the reasons for the decrease in the source of cattle and sheep. The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and the People's Governments of Beijing, Tianjin, and other places have also conducted investigations and research in this regard. It is reported that the main reasons for the lack of meat for Hui people are: First, before liberation, under the cruel plunder of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the profiteering exploitation of illegal merchants, the herdsmen in Inner Mongolia, Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places were forced to sell a large number of livestock in order to maintain a minimum standard of living. After liberation, the living standards of the herdsmen have gradually improved, and they are unwilling to sell a large number of cattle and sheep in order to increase their livestock. Second, spring is the best grazing period, and herdsmen generally do not want to sell livestock during this period. Therefore, beef and mutton are even scarcer in the spring. Third, the standards for prohibiting the slaughter of draft cattle in various places are generally too strict. Taking Tianjin as an example: Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the standards for inspecting cattle in slaughterhouses were: northern cattle (i.e., market cattle) with more than six teeth and southern cattle (draft cattle) that were disabled, old, sick, or blind (equivalent to about 20 years old) could be slaughtered. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the standards became even stricter. Northern cattle must have more than seven teeth, and southern cattle must be completely unable to work before they can be slaughtered. Fourth, this spring, foot-and-mouth disease occurred in some areas of Inner Mongolia, and the quarantine time at the quarantine stations in Zhangjiakou and other places was too long. Cattle transported from the foot-and-mouth disease area had to be delayed there for 35 days, and cattle transported from non-epidemic areas also had to be delayed for a week. Many cattle dealers therefore lost money and were unwilling to transport them anymore.
    In order to solve the meat problem for Hui people, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government convened a meeting at the end of May to jointly study solutions with relevant departments. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government has considered appropriately relaxing the inspection standards for slaughtering cattle in Beijing and Tianjin, the quarantine stations in Zhangjiakou and Shanhaiguan have exempted cattle from non-epidemic areas with certificates from inspection and shortened the inspection time for cattle from epidemic areas, and the Ministry of Trade and the North China Trade Company have instructed relevant trade departments to strengthen the supply of cattle and sheep in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. In recent months, the supply of cattle and sheep in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places has begun to improve. We suggest that relevant departments consider appropriate measures on the source of cattle and sheep, the inspection standards for slaughtering cattle, and the prices of beef, mutton, and cowhide, based on the specific conditions in various places, to solve the meat problem for Hui people in various places.

### 建议有关部门解决回民缺少肉食的问题

专栏：读者来信综述

    建议有关部门解决回民缺少肉食的问题
    近来我们收到北京、天津及归绥等地的回民和回民工作者的来信，要求人民政府帮助回民解决牛羊肉食缺乏的问题。
    牛羊肉（特别是牛肉）是回族（以及其他信仰伊斯兰教的民族）人民的主要肉食，但今年春季以来牛羊肉（尤其是牛肉）非常缺乏。北京市某读者来信说：“我是一个回民，也是回民工作者。有许多回民经常问我：为什么我们常常买不到牛肉？为了解决这个问题，我曾经做了一些调查。北京市今年的宰牛数字逐月减少。四月份全市宰牛数字仅为三月份的百分之四十一。今年四月宰牛的数字，仅为去年同期的六分之一。人民的生活一天比一天提高，但回民的肉食供给量却逐渐减少。我希望你们负责研究并建议有关部门解决这个问题。”
    归绥市回民马宽来信谈：绥远省归绥、包头两市，因为牛、羊来源减少，牛羊肉十分缺乏。去年归绥市的牛羊屠户每月宰牛近百头、羊一百多只；但自今年一月到六月，一共宰牛、羊各六、七十头。
    牛羊的来源少了，这不仅使牛羊屠宰业的生意大为减少，使回族人民缺乏肉食，而且影响了和屠宰业有关的饮食业、牛羊肉业、硝皮业、生皮业和牛奶业。天津市几个牛羊业户联名来信说：如果政府再不帮助解决牛羊的来源问题，我们就要失业了。天津市共有牛羊行一千多户，几千个工人，但五月份全市每天平均仅宰牛八头。这叫我们怎样维持生产？    
    这些地区的回民迫切地要求政府解决这个问题。归绥市回民杨伯弟来信说：自从绥远全省和平解放以后，共产党和人民政府帮助我们建立了回民自治区，使我们自己掌握了政权。我们的生活一天比一天好起来了。我们对政府各方面的政策都非常满意。但我们要求政府解决缺少肉食的问题。
    我们收到这些读者来信后，立即和中央人民政府民族事务委员会联系，并派人到察哈尔、绥远等地调查牛羊来源减少的原因。中央民族事务委员会及京、津等地人民政府，同样进行了这方面的调查研究工作。据悉：回民缺少肉食的主要原因是：第一、解放前，内蒙、察哈尔、绥远等地的牧民，在国民党反动派的残酷掠夺和不法奸商的暴利剥削之下，为了维持最低限度的生活，被迫大量出卖牲畜。解放后，牧民们生活日渐上升，他们为了增殖牲畜，不愿大量出卖牛羊。第二、春季是最好的放牧期，牧民在这个期间，一般都不愿出卖牲畜。因此牛羊肉在春季更感缺乏。第三、各地禁宰耕牛的标准一般都失之过严。以天津为例：“三反”运动前，屠宰场验牛的标准是：北牛（即菜牛）在六个牙以上、南牛（耕牛）残老病瞎（相当于二十岁左右）者才能宰杀。“三反”运动后，标准更加严了。北牛必须七个牙以上，南牛必须完全失去劳动力者，才能宰杀。第四、今春内蒙部分地区发生口蹄疫，张家口等地检疫站的检疫时间太长，从牛蹄瘟疫区运出的牛，有的要在那里耽误三十五天，非疫区运出的牛，也要耽误一星期。许多牛贩因此赔本。不愿再去贩了。
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会为了解决回民的肉食问题，曾于五月底召集会议，与各有关部门共同研究解决办法。中央农业部已考虑适当放宽北京、天津两市宰牛的检验标准，张家口和山海关检疫站已免验有证明的非疫区牛，缩短疫区牛的检验时间，贸易部及华北贸易公司已指示有关贸易部门，加强京津等地牛羊的供应工作。近月来，北京、天津等地牛羊的供应情况，已开始有所改善。我们建议各有关部门，根据各地的具体情况，在牛羊来源、宰牛的检验标准和牛羊肉及牛皮的价格等问题上，考虑适当的办法，以解决各地回民的肉食问题。
