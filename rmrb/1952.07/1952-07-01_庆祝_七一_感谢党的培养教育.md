    Celebrating "July 1st" and Thanking the Party for its Cultivation and Education
    Qi Jianhua
    In welcoming the Party's birthday – the great "July 1st" – I want to thank the Party for its education and cultivation of me.

    In 1938, when I was in school, my teacher Zhang Kuiguang was a Communist Party member. He often explained the meaning of life to me, which made me begin to understand some revolutionary knowledge and inspired me to participate in revolutionary work. In 1948, the People's Liberation Army liberated my hometown, and I joined the army – I was admitted to the Central Plains Military Region Military and Political University. There, I received the Party's direct education, which initially improved my class consciousness and political level. I very much hoped to go to the forefront of the war to fiercely strike the fleeing Chiang bandit troops, or to go to the army's cultural troupe to do propaganda work. But the organization assigned me to work as a cultural instructor in the Ministry of Health. I thought, in the revolutionary ranks I am only a small tree, wherever the organization plants me, I will grow there. So, I settled down to do the work of a cultural instructor. In my work, because I was not familiar with the army, I often encountered some difficulties. I would ask the instructor for guidance and often discuss with the soldiers, seeking ways to overcome difficulties from them. Every time I saw our lovely soldiers, I would think of the scene when they were holding weapons, shedding blood and sweat, and fighting bravely for the people; they defeated the Chiang bandit troops, which relieved me of all the suffering in the old society, and enabled me to join the big revolutionary family and come into the embrace of the Party. Therefore, when I taught them to read, I tried my best to be careful, patient, sincere, and amiable. In this way, under the leadership of the Party, I finally worked with the broad masses of commanders, fighters, and many cultural instructors to research and create the "Rapid Literacy Method."

    Since then, many cultural instructor comrades have written to me asking to learn from me. On April 23rd this year, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government awarded me a certificate of merit. I felt immense honor. The acquisition of this honor is mainly due to the correctness of the Party's leadership. With Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the cultural and educational work of the troops on August 1st, 1950, with the attention and leadership of leaders at all levels, with the pioneering role of Communist Party members in taking the lead in learning in the cultural learning movement, and with the Party's long-term meticulous and patient education and cultivation of me, I was able to obtain this honor. Everything should be attributed to the Party, attributed to Chairman Mao. On the 31st anniversary of the founding of our Party, I express my determination to work better under the leadership of the Party, to study hard, to improve my political and cultural level, and to complete the glorious task of cultural education work assigned to me by the Party, in order to answer the Party's love and nurturing of me.

### 庆祝“七一”感谢党的培养教育

    庆祝“七一”感谢党的培养教育
    祁建华
    在迎接党的生日——伟大的“七一”时，我要感谢党对我的教育和培养。
    一九三八年，我在学校上学，老师张奎光是个共产党员，他经常跟我讲解人生的意义，使我开始懂得了一些革命的知识，启发了我要参加革命工作的思想。一九四八年，人民解放军解放了我的家乡，我就参加了部队——考入了中原军区军政大学。在那里，我接受了党对我的直接教育，使我初步提高了阶级觉悟和政治水平。我很希望到战争的最前线，去狠狠地打击南逃的蒋匪军，或者到部队文工团去作宣传工作。但是组织上分配我去卫生部担任文化教员工作。我想，在革命队伍里我只是一棵小树，组织上栽到那里，就在那里生长。于是，我就安下心来做文化教员工作。在工作中，由于对部队不熟悉，常常遇到一些困难，我就请示指导员，并经常和战士们一起商量，从他们那里求得克服困难的办法。我每见到我们可爱的战士，总会想到他们拿着武器，流血流汗，为人民英勇作战时的情景；他们打垮了蒋匪军，这才解除了我在旧社会的一切痛苦，使我能投到革命的大家庭里来，到党的怀抱里来。因此我教他们识字时，尽量作到细心、耐心、诚恳、和气。就这样，我终于在党的领导下，和广大的指挥员、战斗员和很多文化教员一起研究，创造了“速成识字法”。
    自此以后，好多文化教员同志都来信要向我学习。今年四月二十三日，中央人民政府文化教育委员会又给我颁发奖状。我感受到莫大的光荣。这个荣誉的获得，主要的还是由于党的领导的正确。有了毛主席在一九五○年八月一日对部队文化教育工作的英明指示，有了各级首长的重视和领导，有了共产党员在文化学习运动中带头学习的先锋作用，有了党对我长时期的细心和耐心的教育、培养，我才获得了这样的荣誉。一切应该归功于党、归功于毛主席。在我党诞生的三十一周年纪念日，我表示：决心在党的领导下更好地工作，努力学习，提高我的政治、文化水平，完成党所给我的文化教育工作的光荣任务，以回答党对我的爱护和养育。
