Self-Criticism Regarding Delaying the Construction of the Xinxiang Coal Construction Company's Dedicated Railway Line

Editor: The People's Daily published on June 22nd, Comrade Xin Hualai's criticism of our bureau's delay in constructing the Xinxiang Coal Construction Company's dedicated railway line, which is completely correct. Our bureau had already assigned the task of this project last November. Later, because the Ministry of Railways' Station Yard Section sent people to Zhengzhou to study the development plans of major stations, it was believed that the Xinxiang Coal Construction Company's site would hinder the future development plans of the station. After hearing this, without receiving a formal order or instruction from the Ministry of Railways, we suspended the project until June 20th, when construction finally began. We did not consider that the station's development plan was a matter for several years in the future, while the coal construction company's dedicated line was a real issue for saving the country's funds. On June 23rd, after seeing Comrade Xin Hualai's criticism, we convened relevant personnel for self-criticism and studied remedial measures. On June 24th, we assigned the person in charge of the capital construction engineering team to go to the site to make arrangements and speed up construction. We have made a guarantee to the Coal Construction Company: to strive to complete the track laying task by July 15th.

### 郑州铁路管理局工程处  对拖延修建新乡煤建公司专用线的检讨

    对拖延修建新乡煤建公司专用线的检讨
    编辑同志：六月二十二日人民日报登载了新华来同志对我局拖延修建新乡煤建公司专用线的批评，这是完全正确的。去年十一月我局已经布置了此项工程的任务，后来因为铁道部站场课派人来郑州研究各大车站发展计划，认为新乡煤建公司场址有碍将来车站的发展计划。听到了这个说法以后，我们没有得到铁道部的正式命令或指示，就停办了这项工程，直到六月二十日才开始动工。我们没有考虑到车站发展计划是几年以后的事情，而煤建公司专用线却是为国家节约资金的现实问题。六月二十三日我们看到新华来同志的批评，就召集有关人员进行检讨，研究补救办法。二十四日我们指派基本建设工程队负责人亲赴现场布置，加紧施工。我们已向煤建公司提出保证：争取七月十五日完成铺轨任务。
