    Commemorating the Party's Birthday, Learn Enterprise Management Well
    Gao Fangqi
    Editor's Note: Gao Fangqi is the factory director of a factory in Shenyang and a well-known labor model in the Northeast region. Last year, on National Day, he was invited to Beijing to attend the celebrations, and he also attended the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate. In enterprise management, he resolutely relies on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, and on the basis of realizing quota management, he has implemented group economic accounting and the workshop fund system. Therefore, the factory he leads has exceeded the state's tasks every month and has created many advanced experiences.
    While commemorating the Party's birthday, recalling my process of learning to manage enterprises under the leadership of the Party fills my heart with courage and confidence.
    I have been working in factories since the spring of 1941. From Jin-Cha-Ji, Zhangjiakou, Dalian to Shenyang, I have never left the factory. But at that time, I had no experience in managing factories. I simply believed in administrative power. Plans were laid out, but they were often not completed, and I did not know the reason.
    I truly began to understand factory management after the liberation of Shenyang—when the Party's leadership focus shifted to industry and to the cities.
    In the past three years, under the leadership of the Party, I have learned a lot of knowledge and received a lot of education from the Party. On the day of commemorating the Party's birthday, I examine my past work, and the following four deeply felt issues emerge in my mind.
    The first realization is that, as an administrative management cadre, standing in an administrative management position, one must first unite with the organizations of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. This is the starting point for the work of the entire factory. Without this, nothing can be discussed. This unity is built on the basis of doing a good job in production. In our factory, this has become a habit. Every month, when production tasks and any work assignments are laid out, the responsible cadres of our Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League always study the documents together first, carefully study the instructions from higher authorities, and then engage in full discussion and debate. After everyone reaches a consensus in their thinking and clarifies the key points, they respectively draft their own plans and carry out deployments and mobilizations through their own organizations. In the process of execution, everyone holds a "brainstorming session" every day to discuss and solve specific problems. In a word, everyone completes the same task in different positions, through different organizational systems, and using different methods. In this way, the work becomes much easier. Although everyone often has arguments, because everyone can seriously understand the instructions from higher authorities, they can always reach a consensus in the end. We have never had unprincipled disputes. In a factory, constantly maintaining the unity of leadership thinking makes work feel easy and pleasant.
    The second realization is that, to rely on the working class, one must rely on the organizations of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and administrative cadres must also do political work. In the past, I also approached the workers, sought their opinions, and understood some specific situations, but all of this was carried out from the administrative aspect. The work plans formulated based on this were not specific or comprehensive. Now it is different. Our production plans are comprehensively organized for employee discussion and mobilize all employees to complete them. Before the discussion, we rely on the Party organization to understand the situation, and Party members often reflect some situations and opinions of employees that the leadership may not have thought of. In this way, the plans we make are more specific and comprehensive. After the plans are made, the Party and the Communist Youth League always deploy them a few days earlier. Party members and League members first incubate them among the masses and establish cores among the masses. This truly means that someone is organizing these things among the masses, which is much more effective than purely administrative deployment or general appeals.
    We also pay attention to doing work through the trade union organization. Whenever there are mass activities, we try to work through the trade union. If everything is done through administrative means, it seems monotonous and rigid, and it cannot encourage the emotions of the masses. The situation is different when working through the trade union. In this process, the most important question is how the administration supports the trade union. I joined the trade union in 1941, but I never thought about how to help the trade union work. I slowly clarified this issue after arriving in Shenyang. At the beginning, I only felt that it was difficult for the trade union to independently implement the plan, so I actively helped the trade union in terms of material conditions and cadres, thinking that in this way, the trade union could work independently. Later, I further realized that this was far from enough; material and cadres are only the most basic help. From this time on, I participated in the discussion of trade union work. In particular, I often talked in detail with the responsible cadres of the trade union about the main production issues. Due to the nature of their work, administrative cadres understand production issues most clearly, but if the trade union does not understand these situations, there is no way to use its own strength. I often report these production situations to the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and study them together. In this way, the plans made by the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League can take into account the needs of long-term, comprehensive, and regular work, and can think about future development, rather than being limited to one or two specific tasks.
    Administrative cadres must do political work. This point was also unclear to me in the past, and it has been gradually recognized in recent years. I have deeply experienced that, in state-owned factories with socialist characteristics, the political life and economic life of all employees are closely combined. When this factory was first liberated, the workers' thinking was very chaotic, the work was overwhelming, and the leadership did not know what to focus on. Later, our Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League cooperated and vigorously carried out class education, which initially improved the workers' awareness. Then, we organized production. In less than a year, we mastered the balance of production and achieved rhythmic production. The workers were thereby trained and strengthened their organization and discipline. Production itself transforms people's thinking, and political work and economic work promote and serve each other. From this, I deeply realized that an administrative cadre must do political work. Looking back to when I was in Dalian, production plans were also formulated, and meetings were also held to discuss them, but they could never be implemented because I did not understand how to do political work. At that time, I occasionally did the right thing on individual events. For example, when the factory received an urgent task, we would explain to the workers the important significance of this task, and as a result, the workers came up with many methods and demonstrated creative abilities that we could not have imagined, completing the task on time. Thinking back today, this was preliminary political work. But at that time, I did not clearly realize this point. Now it is different. In every link of the plan, we pay attention to how the administration can do political work. Our factory not only enables leading cadres at the factory level to do this, but we also educate middle-level cadres to do this. Now, when our workshop cadres deploy work each time, they collect the opinions of the masses and understand the workers' thinking. If there is a lack of teachers for giving political lessons, the workshop director will give them, and he does not feel that this is not his responsibility. Now, workshop cadres attach even more importance to political work than we do. They cooperate with the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League in pilot work in each movement, in grasping the key issues of each period, and in attacking weak links and changing backward units, and it has become a work habit.
    Now, core groups (including Party members, League members, and mass activists) have been established in all departments, and department heads have learned to use core groups to plan and promote each task. During the quality inspection last year, we explained to the technical personnel their role in the movement and pointed out that the way to play their role is to combine with the workers. We organized technical personnel to conduct ideological criticism, and then launched a competition.
    As production gradually gets on the right track, my own work and life have also gradually become regularized. In the past, although I also knew the principle of "production transforms people's ideology," I only understood it from the literal meaning and did not experience it so deeply. Now we have become accustomed to it: every time a plan is deployed, after two weeks, we naturally start preparing for the next month's plan. We stipulate that collective contracts should be checked twice a month. The work every week and every day is also roughly arranged in advance. When I go to the workshop, I go there purposefully to check and solve problems, and I have a general idea in my mind: which workshop to go to first, where the problems are easy to solve; which workshop to go to last, where the problems need to be carefully studied, and may not be solved today. These are all considered when flipping through the work diary the night before. Our workshop administrative cadres, technical cadres, and Party-mass work cadres all have work diaries, which are reviewed separately every night by the responsible cadres at the factory level. General problems are solved in this way, without the form of meetings and reports. In this way, we can not only foresee what to do tomorrow, and everyone can grasp the main situation at the time at the daily brainstorming meeting, but also, because the cadres of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League have diaries, they understand the issues more specifically and comprehensively.
    With the above two conditions—the unity of thinking among leading comrades and concrete reliance on the working class—as the foundation, plus timely learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, production can be continuously improved and increased. This is the third experience. To mention a few major points: when we took over the factory in 1949, production was very chaotic. In October, we started the New Record Movement, and we learned from the Soviet experience, using the quota method to set quotas and implement quota management; then we learned from the Soviet experience of making plans—making plans according to the daily output of each process. By November, the face of production had basically changed, and by the beginning of 1950, we had achieved rhythmic production. Now our daily balance rate (that is, completing the plan evenly every day rather than fluctuating) has reached 95%, and from the production situation in the first half of January each year, we can predict whether the task can be completed throughout the year. Because we have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have shortened the production cycle from 85 days to the current 44 days. In terms of workshop economic accounting, we have also learned from the Soviet experience and achieved the calculation of group costs. In this Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, we have further established a "savings manual" for each person, which records individual indicators in terms of output, quality, and cost, is registered once a day, and is statistically compiled once a week. In this way, every worker has a clear idea in mind, can urge himself at any time, and better complete the state's plan. We also calculate piece-rate wages in this manual, so that workers directly see the connection between completing the state's plan and personal income, which has played a great role in improving their awareness and production enthusiasm.
    We have also learned a lot of Soviet experience in technology. For example, our machines could only do one thing at a time. By learning from the Soviet experience, we transformed many lathes into multi-punching machines, increasing efficiency by 80 to 100 percent. In the past, one or two people watched a machine. By learning the Soviet multi-machine operation method, one person can now watch up to four machines. Among these experiences, the working method of Kovalev has played the greatest role in our factory. It enabled us to discover and concentrate the creativity of all workers and technicians, and it has become the factory's rules and regulations—technical operating procedures—which has played a huge role in improving production.
    On the basis of promoting these advanced experiences, we have universally adopted a series of organizational forms such as apprenticeship contracts, mutual assistance groups, and technical research associations; in addition, the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League have systematically struggled against conservative thinking and conducted education on respecting teachers and loving apprentices, so that the technical level of workers has been continuously improved, becoming a favorable condition for our Increase Production and Practice Economy movement this year. Last year, 60% of the workers in our factory were apprentices. Now there are only 10% apprentices left—mainly those who have been continuously newly added. The continuous improvement of the technical level of workers has provided a foundation for production. In the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement this year, workers have proposed a total of more than 1,500 tips, of which 30% were proposed by young workers.
    The last realization is that we must care more about the material and cultural lives of employees. This is a major event in the factory. Due to the increase in production, the administration has mastered a large amount of the director's fund, and improving the material and cultural life of employees is not only something that should be done, but also something that can be done.
    In this regard, the administration must fully respect the opinions of the masses from the trade union. The best method is to use the experience learned from the Soviet Union—the collective contract system. In the past, we also attached importance to the welfare of employees, but because the production plan was clear and the welfare plan was not specific, we ended up using all our strength on production, and the welfare work was more planned than done, and was basically in a state of laissez-faire. At the same time, in the past, welfare work was only done based on the reflections of some workers, and the leadership only did what it thought should be done. Unlike now, we first propose a welfare plan, submit it to all employees for discussion, and then explain everything clearly to the masses. Now, after the plan is discussed and approved by the masses, a contract must be solemnly signed, turning it into law; plus regular inspections, this guarantees welfare work.
    In dealing with this issue, we must oppose conservative thinking. The administration should take a proactive attitude and continuously improve the lives of employees on the basis of striving to increase production. For example, at the beginning of this year, we had a total of 2 billion yuan in the director's fund. At first, we did not dare to use it boldly. Later, we launched the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement and calculated that we could further increase production and save 52,000 tons of grain, and the director's fund could probably get another 3 billion yuan. So we boldly used this fund to buy two brand-new Soviet Da Jishi buses to pick up and drop off pregnant sanatorium members and elderly workers during commuting hours, and also established a chronic disease sanatorium that can accommodate 60 people. The two most thorny problems in the factory were solved. At the opening ceremony of the driving and the sanatorium, the workers were very excited and clenched their fists and said, "Work hard! Two more next year!" In addition, we also bought ice fruit machines to make ice fruit for workers doing high-temperature work. In this quarter, we increased the book fee by 10 million yuan, and we bought a total of 3,000 books before and after. When the workers' lives are improved and their political awareness is raised, they naturally have a demand for improving their culture. Conversely, when the workers' cultural level is improved, all work will be easier to do, and production will increase faster. The amateur cultural school in our factory has never stopped, and in the future, we can also open an amateur technical school and vigorously promote the quick literacy method.
    Eleven years ago, the first factory I worked in in Jin-Cha-Ji had only about 100 people. Now, not only are we a factory with thousands of workers and sufficient mechanical equipment, but we also plan to complete the automatic device and mechanization of our entire factory by the end of 1953. We want to completely use machines and conveyor belts to replace manual labor. At that time, we can reduce one-third of the manpower and increase production by 20 to 25 percent. Now we have started the design work. We will complete the automation of the machine itself by the end of this year, and we will completely connect them next year. Thinking about the factory's grand future, thinking about my own progress in learning enterprise management in recent years, I am truly full of hope and confidence for the future—the future of our motherland, the future of our factory, and the future of myself. In order to welcome this future, we must intensify our efforts to overcome existing shortcomings, and first of all, we must strengthen theoretical learning. Now our ideological level is very low, we do not study documents regularly, and we always cram at the last minute, flipping through whatever we need to do. I only roughly read Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," and I discovered countless shortcomings in our work. For example, sometimes when there is too much work, we complain to our superiors, which shows that we have not yet learned to grasp and solve the main contradictions. Business learning is also very poor. We have bought many books introducing Soviet experience, but we have never systematically studied them, and we also flip through them as needed. We have long thought about organizing all technical personnel and management personnel to learn business, but we have been dragging it out until now, always saying that we will do it after the movement is over. But the movement will never end, so this time we are determined to start it immediately. In addition, we have not done enough in the work of systematically and organizationally cultivating advanced figures and establishing flags among the masses, and we must improve this well in the future.

    纪念党的生日，学好企业管理
    高方启
    编者按：高方启是沈阳市一个工厂的厂长，是东北区著名的劳动模范。他于去年国庆节，曾被邀来首都观礼，并列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议。他在企业管理方面，坚决依靠党的领导和群众的支持，在实现定额管理的基础上，实行了小组经济核算和车间基金制。因此，他所领导的工厂，每月都超额完成了国家的任务，并且创造了许多先进的经验。
    在纪念党的生日的时候，回想起自己在党的领导下学习管理企业的过程，心里充满了勇气和信心。
    我从一九四一年春天起就在工厂里工作。从晋察冀、张家口、大连到沈阳，一直没有离开过工厂。但那时候我对管理工厂是没有经验的。我只单纯相信行政力量。计划布置下去，往往完不成，我也不知道原因在那里。
    我真正开始懂得管理工厂，还是在沈阳解放以后——党的领导重心转向工业，转向城市的时候。
    三年来，在党的领导下，我学到许多知识，受到党的很多教育。在纪念党的生日的今天，我检查一下自己过去的工作，在脑子里浮现出来下面四个体会很深的问题。
    第一个体会是：作为一个行政管理干部，站在行政管理的岗位上，首先必须和党、工会、青年团的组织团结一致。这是整个工厂工作的起点。没有这一点，一切都谈不到。这种团结，是建立在搞好生产的基础上的。在我们工厂里，这一点已经成为习惯。每个月的生产任务和任何一件工作布置下来，我们党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部，总是先在一起学习文件，细致地研究上级指示，然后展开充分的讨论和争论。大家在思想上取得一致，明确了关键以后，就分别草拟自己的计划，通过自己的组织，进行布置和动员。在执行过程中，大家每天举行一个“碰头会”，商量、解决一些具体问题。一句话，大家在不同的岗位上，通过不同的组织系统，用不同的方法，去完成同一个任务。这样，工作就好做得多了。虽然大家也常常有争论，但因为大家都能认真领会上级的指示，最后总能取得一致意见。我们从来没有闹过无原则的纠纷。在一个工厂里，经常保持着领导思想的统一，工作起来就感觉得轻松、愉快了。
    第二个体会是：要依靠工人阶级，就要依靠党和工会、青年团的组织，而行政干部也要做政治工作。过去我也接近工人，也向工人征求意见，也了解一些具体情况，但这都是从行政一方面来进行的。据此制订的工作计划是不具体不全面的。现在则不同了。我们的生产计划是全面地组织职工讨论的，是动员全体职工来完成的。在讨论以前，我们依靠党的组织了解情况，党员们常常把领导方面不可能想到的一些情况和职工的意见反映上来。这样，我们做出的计划就比较具体、全面了。计划做出来以后，党和青年团总要早布置几天。党员和团员们先在群众中酝酿，在群众中建立核心。这就真正有人在群众中组织这些事情了，这比单纯由行政上布置，比只进行一般号召的效力大得多了。
    我们也注意了通过工会组织来做工作。凡是群众活动的场合，尽量通过工会来作工作。如果一切都用行政出面来做，就显得千篇一律，很死板，不能鼓励群众的情绪。通过工会来做工作，情况就不同了。在这中间，最重要的问题是行政如何支持工会。我从一九四一年就参加了工会，但一直没有想到过如何帮助工会工作。我到沈阳以后，才慢慢明确了这个问题。开始，我只感到靠工会独立贯彻计划有困难，便在物质条件上，干部上积极帮助工会，觉得这样一来，工会就可以独立工作了。以后我才进一步体会到，这是远远不够的，物质和干部只是最起码的帮助。从这时起，我就参加了对工会工作的讨论。特别是生产上的主要问题，我经常是要和工会的负责干部详细谈的。由于工作岗位的关系，行政干部了解生产问题最清楚，但如果工会不了解这些情况，就没有办法使用自己的力量。我常常把这些生产情况，报告给党、工会和青年团，和他们一起研究。这样，党、工会和青年团所做的计划，就能照顾到长期的、全面的、经常工作的需要，能想到将来的发展，而不致于局限在一两件具体工作上了。
    行政干部要做政治工作。这一点也是我过去不明确的，也是在这几年中逐步认识的。我深刻地体验到：在社会主义性质的国营工厂中，全体职工的政治生活与经济生活是密切结合的。这个工厂在刚刚解放时，工人思想十分混乱，工作千头万绪，领导方面不知道抓什么好。后来，我们党、行政、工会、青年团协同一致，大力进行阶级教育，初步提高了工人的觉悟。接着，我们就组织生产。不到一年，我们就掌握了生产的平衡，做到了有节奏的生产。工人由此受到了锻炼，加强了组织性、纪律性。生产本身就改造着人的思想，而政治工作和经济工作二者，是互相推动，互相为用的。从这里面我深深地体会到：一个行政干部必须要做政治工作。回想过去我在大连时，生产计划也订了，也开会讨论了，但总是不能贯彻执行，原因就是不懂得做政治工作。那时偶而在个别事件上也做对了。例如在工厂接到某项紧急任务时，我们就向工人讲这项任务的重要意义，结果工人就想出了很多办法，发挥出了我们想像不到的创造能力，按期完成了任务。今天回想起来，这就是初步的政治工作。但是当时我没有明确地意识到这一点。现在不同了。在计划的每一个环节上，我们都注意到行政上如何做政治工作。我们厂不但厂一级的领导干部能这样做，我们并且教育中层干部也这样做。现在我们的车间干部每次布置工作时，都要搜集群众的意见，了解工人的思想。讲政治课，缺乏教员，车间主任就去讲，他并不感到这不是自己的责任。现在车间干部比我们还重视政治工作。他们对每个运动中的试点工作，对掌握每一时期的关键问题，对突击薄弱环节、改变落后单位，都是配合着党、工会、青年团一起作，而且变成了工作习惯。
    现在各科都成立了核心小组（包括党、团员群众积极分子），科长们都学会了运用核心小组来筹划、推动每一件工作。在去年质量检查时，我们对技术人员讲清了他们在运动中的作用，并指出了发挥他们的作用的方法是和工人结合。我们组织技术人员进行了思想批判，然后开展了竞赛。
    随着生产的逐渐步入正轨，我自己的工作和生活也逐渐规律化了。过去我虽然也知道“生产改造人的思想意识”的道理，但只是从字面上了解，没有体验得这样深刻。现在我们已经变成了习惯：每一次计划布置下去，过了两个星期，就自然而然地动手准备下个月的计划了。我们规定一个月检查两次集体合同。每周每天的工作，也都是预先大体上安排了的。我下车间都是有目的地去检查和解决问题，而且心里有个谱：先到那个车间，那里的问题好解决；最后到那个车间，那个问题要仔细研究，也许今天解决不了。这些都是头一天晚上翻工作日记时考虑好了的。我们的车间行政干部、技术干部、党群工作干部都有工作日记，每天晚上由厂一级的负责干部分头批阅，一般问题都这样解决，不用开会汇报的形式。这样，我们不但能够预见到明天该做什么，在每天的碰头会上每个人都能掌握当时的主要情况，而且由于党、行政、工会、青年团的干部有日记，了解的问题就更加具体、全面了。
    有了前面这两个条件——领导同志思想一致、具体地依靠工人阶级——作基础，再加上及时学习苏联先进经验，生产就可以不断改进和提高了。这是第三个体验。举几件主要的说：我们在一九四九年刚刚接收工厂的时候，生产很乱。十月里开始搞新纪录运动，我们就学习苏联经验，用标定方法进行定额，实行了定额管理；接着我们又学习苏联订计划的经验——按每个工序的日产量做计划。到十一月，生产面貌就基本改变了，到一九五○年初做到了有节奏地生产。现在我们的日均衡率（即每日均衡地而不是跳动地完成计划）已达到了百分之九十五，从每年一月份头半个月的生产情况，就可以预见到全年是否能完成任务。由于我们学习了苏联先进经验，把生产周期从八十五天缩短到了现在的四十四天。在车间经济核算方面，我们也学习了苏联的经验，做到了计算小组成本。在这次增产节约运动中，我们又进一步建立每个人的“积累手册”，上面记载着个人在产量、质量、成本各方面的指标，每天登记一次，每个星期统计一次。这样就使得每个工人都心中有数，可能时时督促自己，更好地完成国家的计划。我们还把计件工资也计算在这个手册里面，使工人直接看到了完成国家计划和个人收入的联系，对提高他们的觉悟和生产热情都起了很大的作用。
    在技术方面我们也学习了不少的苏联经验。例如我们的机器一次只能做一个活，学习苏联的经验，把很多床子改成了多冲头的，效率提高了百分之八十到一百。过去我们是一个人或两个人看一台机器，学习了苏联的多机台操作方法，现在一个人最多能看四台机器。在这些经验中间，在我们厂起作用最大的是郭瓦廖夫的工作方法。它使我们发现了和集中了全体工人和技术人员的创造，变成了厂规厂法——技术操作规程，对提高生产起了极大的作用。
    在推广这些先进经验的基础上，我们普遍地采用了师徒合同、互助小组、技术研究会等一系列的组织形式；加以党、工会、青年团对保守思想进行了系统的斗争，又进行了尊师爱徒等教育，使工人的技术水平不断提高，成为我们今年增产节约运动中的有利条件。去年我们全厂工人有百分之六十是徒工。现在只剩了百分之十的徒工——主要还是陆续新添进来的。工人的技术水平不断提高，使生产有了基础。今年增产节约运动中，工人一共提出一千五百多个窍门，其中有百分之三十是青年工人提出来的。
    最后一个体会是：要多关心职工的物质和文化生活。这是工厂里的一件大事。由于生产提高，行政方面掌握了大量的厂长基金，改善职工的物质、文化生活，不但是应该办到，而且是可能办到的了。
    在这方面，行政方面必须十分尊重从工会方面来的群众意见。最好的方法，是运用从苏联学得的经验——集体合同制度。过去我们也重视职工的福利问题，但是因为生产计划明确，而福利计划并不具体，结果把力量都使用到生产上去了，福利工作就计划的多，做到的少，基本上处于自流状态。同时，过去办福利工作也只是根据部分工人的反映，领导方面认为该做的才做，不像现在首先提出福利计划，交全体职工讨论，然后都向群众交代清楚。现在，计划经群众讨论通过之后，要隆重地签订合同，把它变成法律；再加上定期的检查，这就使福利工作有保证了。
    在处理这个问题上，要反对保守思想。行政方面应该采取积极的态度，在努力提高生产的基础上来不断地改善职工的生活。比如今年初我们手里共存有二十亿元厂长基金，开始不敢放胆用，后来，开展了增产节约运动，又算出来可以再增产节约五万二千吨粮食，厂长基金大概还能得三十亿元。于是我们就放胆利用这笔基金，买了两辆崭新的苏联大吉士公共汽车，在上下班时迎送怀孕的疗养员和老年工人，还建立了一所能容六十人的慢性病疗养所。厂里最感棘手的两大问题解决了。在举行开车和疗养所开幕典礼时，工人们非常激动，都握着拳头说：“好好干！明年又是两辆！”此外，我们还买了冰果机，给高温作业的工人做冰果吃。我们在这一季度中，增加了一千万元的图书费，我们前后共买了三千册图书。工人生活提高了，政治觉悟提高了，自然就有了提高文化的要求。反过来，工人文化水平提高了，一切工作就会更加好办，生产提高的也会更快。我们工厂的业余文化学校一直没有停，以后我们还可开办业余技术学校，并大力推行速成识字法。
    十一年前，我在晋察冀参加工作的第一个工厂，一共只有一百来人。现在呢，我们不但是一个有几千个工人，有足够的机械装备的工厂，而且我们还打算在一九五三年底，完成我们全厂的自动装置和机械化。我们完全要用机器，用传动带代替人力劳动。那时，我们就可以减少三分之一的人力，提高产量百分之二十到二十五。现在我们已经开始了设计工作，今年年底要完成机械本身的自动化，明年就要把它们完全联结起来。想想工厂的远大前途，想想我自己这几年来在学习企业管理上所得到的进步，对未来——我们祖国的未来，我们工厂的未来，连同我自己的未来——真是充满了希望和信心。为了迎接这个未来，我们要加紧努力，克服现有的缺点，首先要加强理论学习。现在我们的思想水平很低，学习文件不经常，总是临时抱佛脚，做什么才现翻什么。我只粗看了一遍毛主席的矛盾论，就发现了我们工作中的无数缺点。例如：有时工作多了就向上级叫，这说明我们还没有学会抓住和解决主要的矛盾。业务学习也很差。介绍苏联经验的书我们买了很多，但是一直没有系统地学，也是现用现翻。我们早就想过组织全体技术人员、管理人员学习业务，但是直拖到现在还没搞起来，总说等运动过去了就搞。但是运动总是不会完的，这回我们下了决心，一定要立刻搞起来。此外，我们对有系统、有组织地培养先进人物，在群众中树立旗帜的工作也做得非常不够，今后也要很好地改进。
