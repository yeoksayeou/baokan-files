    Suggestion for Improving the Arrangement of Chinese Typewriter Fonts
    The currently used arrangement of Chinese typewriter fonts is out of touch with actual needs. Some characters that are no longer used, such as 斛, 仄, 忝, 勖, 傥, 跂, 荛, 绎, etc., are still on the font plate; many characters frequently encountered in daily life, such as 你, 们, 它, 咱, 亿, 这, 姻, 很, etc., are locked in the rarely-used character box. Among the special characters for place names, characters such as "Zhili" and "Shengjing" are still retained, but there are no characters such as "Liao" and "Song". In addition, among the nearly five thousand rarely used characters, most are unrecognizable to the average person and of little use, such as 冱, 剗, 喰, 堠, 恉, etc. This situation has already caused a great waste of human and material resources.
    Improving the arrangement of the font plate involves a wide range of issues. This not only concerns typing schools, the type founding industry, and typewriter dealers, but also different types of institutions have different requirements. Therefore, I suggest that you ask all parties to study the work of improving the typewriter font plate.

    Editor's Note: Reader Shan Jinrong's opinion is worth taking seriously. We suggest that the General Administration of Publications and the Ministry of Education and other relevant agencies study this matter in order to solve this problem.

### 建议改进中文打字机字盘排列方法

专栏：来信摘要

    建议改进中文打字机字盘排列方法
    目前通用的中文打字机的字盘排列方法，和实际需要是脱节的。有些已不再采用的字，像斛、仄、忝、勖、傥、跂、荛、绎等，还留在字盘中；很多日常生活中经常碰到的字，像你、们、它、咱、亿、这、姻、很等，却被关在罕用字盒里。在有关地名的特用字中，还保留着“直隶”、“盛京”等字，但没有“辽”、“松”等字。此外，在将近五千个罕用字里，大部分是一般人都不认识，没有什么用处的，像冱、剗、喰、堠、恉等。这种情况已经造成人力、物力上很大的浪费。
    改进字盘的排列方法，牵涉的面很广。这不但关系打字学校、铅字铸造业和打字机商行，而且各不同性质的机关还有不同的要求。因此，我建议你们提请各方面研究改进打字机字盘的工作。
