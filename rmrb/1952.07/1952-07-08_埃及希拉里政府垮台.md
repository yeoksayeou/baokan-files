(Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 5th) Cairo news: Hilali, who became the Prime Minister of Egypt in early March with the support of the United States and Britain, resigned on June 28th. This is the result of the further development of contradictions between American and British imperialism in the Middle East and Near East.

    After coming to power, Hilali adopted a series of terrorist measures domestically, suppressing the national independence movement, dissolving the parliament, and attacking the opposition. He then held negotiations with Britain. In order to maintain its hegemony over Egypt, a strategic hub, Britain consistently refused to make concessions on the withdrawal of troops stationed in Egypt and the issue of Sudan, which aroused great resentment among the Egyptian people and forced Hilali to be reluctant to agree to Britain's demands easily. Therefore, the negotiations came to nothing. This situation greatly dissatisfied the American imperialism, which was eager to establish the so-called "Middle East Command." On the one hand, the United States actively carried out conspiracies in Egypt, taking the opportunity to expand its influence in Egypt; on the other hand, it exerted diplomatic pressure on Britain. Under the direction of the United States, Italy, Greece, Belgium and other countries successively recognized King Farouk of Egypt as the King of Egypt and Sudan. Japan, Brazil, Spain and West Germany also made assurances to Farouk in this regard. Pakistan in the British Commonwealth also recognized Farouk as the King of Egypt and Sudan.

    In order to plan how to deal with American interference, Britain held a meeting of British diplomatic officials stationed in the Middle East in London from June 20th to 24th to study "all aspects of British Middle East policy." According to a United Press report from London on June 20th, the discussions at the meeting showed that Britain "hoped for a British-led Mediterranean defense organization" and hoped to "invite Egypt to fully participate" in this organization after reaching an agreement with Egypt to protect Britain's "traditional interests" in the Middle East. However, this plan was fully opposed by the United States, which was determined to dominate the Middle East, and became a major difference of opinion between Britain and the United States on the plan to invade the Middle East. At the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held on June 27th, the United States only "listened" to Britain's opinions on the Middle East defense issue, but "did not wholeheartedly accept it," but insisted on taking "swift action" (United Press, London, June 29th). In other words, the United States felt that it could no longer tolerate Britain's actions, which hoped to be unique and confront the United States, and thus made the "Middle East Command" plan unable to be realized for a long time.

    Immediately afterwards, Egyptian Prime Minister Hilali resigned on June 28th under pressure from the United States. According to Reuters, this was the result of interference by the US Embassy, ​​because the United States hoped for an Egyptian government that was "willing to ensure a more conciliatory attitude towards Western countries" so that Egypt could join the "Middle East Command" initiated by the United States. British officials in London "expressed disappointment" at the news, "believing that this was a setback for Britain's hopes for a compromise solution to the Anglo-Egyptian dispute" (United Press). Since Hilali's resignation, a new Egyptian government has not yet been formed.

    埃及希拉里政府垮台
    【新华社五日讯】开罗消息：三月初在美英支持下出任埃及首相的希拉里，已经在六月二十八日辞职。这是美英帝国主义在中近东的矛盾进一步发展的结果。
    希拉里在上台以后，在国内采取了一连串的恐怖措施，镇压民族独立运动，解散议会，打击反对派，接着就和英国进行谈判。英国为了要保持对埃及这一战略枢纽的霸权，在撤退驻埃及军队和苏丹问题上始终不肯让步，这引起了埃及人民的极大反感，迫使希拉里不敢轻易答应英国的要求，因此谈判毫无结果。这种情况使得急于成立所谓“中东司令部”的美帝国主义大为不满。美国一方面积极在埃及进行阴谋活动，乘机扩张自己在埃及的势力；一方面对英国施行外交上的压力。在美国指使之下，意大利、希腊、比利时等国家先后承认埃及国王法鲁克为埃及和苏丹国王，日本、巴西、西班牙和西德也就这方面向法鲁克提出了保证。英联邦中的巴基斯坦也承认了法鲁克为埃及和苏丹国王。
    为了筹谋对付美国干涉的办法，英国在六月二十日到二十四日在伦敦举行了一个英国驻中东外交官员的会议，研究“有关英国中东政策各方面的问题”。据合众社伦敦六月二十日电透露，会议的讨论表明：英国“希望有一个由英国领导的地中海防务机构”，并希望在与埃及取得协议后就“邀请埃及全力参加”这个机构，以保障英国在中东地区的“传统利益”。但是这个计划遭到了一心要独霸中东的美国的全力反对，成为英美在侵略中东的计划上的主要的分歧意见。在六月二十七日举行的美、英、法三国外长会议上，美国也只是“倾听”了英国对于中东防务问题的意见，但“并不全心表示接受”，而是坚持采取“迅速行动”（合众社伦敦六月二十九日电）。换句话说，美国对于英国这种希望独树一帜，和美国分庭抗礼，因而使“中东司令部”计划迟迟不能实现的行动，已经感到不能容忍了。
    紧接着，埃及首相希拉里在美国的压力之下于六月二十八日提出了辞职。据路透社透露，这是美国大使馆进行干涉的结果，因为美国希望有一个“愿保证对西方国家采取更为和解态度”的埃及政府，以便让埃及加入美国所发起的“中东司令部”。而伦敦的英国官员则对这个消息“表示失望”，“认为这是英国所抱的折衷解决英埃争端的希望的一个挫折”（合众社）。在希拉里辞职以后，新的埃及政府至今尚未组成。
