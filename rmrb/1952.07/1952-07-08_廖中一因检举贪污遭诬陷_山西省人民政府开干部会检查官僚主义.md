    Liao Zhongyi Framed After Reporting Corruption
    Shanxi Provincial People's Government Holds Cadre Meeting to Examine Bureaucratism
    The case of Liao Zhongyi, a salesman from the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, being framed after reporting corruption has been exposed. To examine the mistakes made by the relevant organs and cadres involved in this incident, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government convened a meeting on June 14th with relevant cadres from the Provincial Thrift Examination Committee, the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Public Security Bureau, and the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company.

    The meeting was personally presided over by Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government. First, the responsible cadres from the relevant organs reported on the process of Liao Zhongyi being framed by corrupt elements after reporting corruption. The course of events is as follows:

    In February 1951, Liao Zhongyi discovered corrupt practices among some cadres of the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company and reported them to Manager Shao Xi (who engaged in serious corruption, refused to confess, and has been arrested and dealt with according to the law) several times. Shao ignored him. Later, he reported it to the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce sent people to investigate and encouraged Liao Zhongyi to continue collecting materials. In order to clarify the issue, Liao Zhongyi conducted investigations at the privately-owned Lijun Coal Factory. Shao Xi and others were very dissatisfied with this and immediately instigated private merchant Zhang Lijun to accuse Liao Zhongyi of "privately investigating business accounts and disrupting social order." Shao Xi and others also helped the private merchant Zhang Lijun revise the "accusation," saying that Liao Zhongyi had serious political problems. After the Public Security Bureau detained Liao Zhongyi, after more than four months of investigation and interrogation, they believed that there was no conclusive evidence of Liao Zhongyi's political problems, so they released him. When Liao Zhongyi was released from prison, Shao Xi and others from the Coal Construction Company had already dismissed him. Because Liao Zhongyi had no means of livelihood, he had to return to his hometown in Jintang County, Sichuan. When he passed through Nanzheng, Shaanxi, he went to the Nanzheng Daily to complain. The Nanzheng Daily forwarded the materials he talked about to the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce. The responsible cadres of the department did not investigate such a major issue, and still replied to the Nanzheng Daily based on the one-sided statements of Shao Xi and others from the Coal Construction Branch. This incident was basically clarified during the "Three-Anti" movement, and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government sent people to bring Liao Zhongyi back to Taiyuan.

    After reporting the process of the "Liao Zhongyi Incident," Li Laitang, Chief of the Business Section (former Chief of the Business Unit) of the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, Han Zhihua, Deputy Chief of the Secretary Section (former Deputy Chief of the Personnel Unit), Jia Yuzhi, Chief of the Personnel Section of the Department of Commerce, Dong Jinzhang of the Security Unit, and Liu Jiuxiang, Chief of the Security Section of the Public Security Bureau, all made preliminary self-criticisms.

    Based on everyone's speeches, Chairman Pei Lisheng gave instructions on how to learn from the lessons of this incident, thoroughly investigate responsibilities, conscientiously overcome bureaucratic errors, improve work, and consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement. He demanded that everyone involved in this incident should earnestly reflect.

    The meeting finally decided that the Provincial People's Government's Thrift Examination Committee would form a working group to handle the "Liao Zhongyi Incident" and send people to express their condolences to Liao Zhongyi.

    廖中一因检举贪污遭诬陷
    山西省人民政府开干部会检查官僚主义
    中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司业务员廖中一因检举贪污分子被陷害的事件，已被揭发出来。山西省人民政府为检查和这个事件有关的机关、干部所犯的错误，于六月十四日召集省节约检查委员会和省商业厅、公安厅、中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司的有关干部开会。
    会议由山西省人民政府裴丽生主席亲自主持。首先由各有关机关负责干部分别报告廖中一因检举贪污反被贪污分子陷害的经过。事件的经过是：
    一九五一年二月间，廖中一发现中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司某些干部有贪污行为，曾数次向经理邵熙（有严重贪污行为，拒不坦白，已逮捕法办）报告。邵不加理睬。后又向商业厅反映。商业厅曾派人前去检查，并鼓励廖中一继续搜集材料。廖中一为了把问题弄清，曾向私营利军煤厂进行调查。邵熙等对此十分不满，当即教唆私商张利军，以廖中一“私查商号账簿，捣乱社会秩序”为藉口进行控告。邵熙等并帮助私商张利军修改“状子”，说廖中一有严重的政治问题。公安厅将廖中一扣押后，经四个多月的调查、审讯，认为廖中一的政治问题，并无确凿证据，始将其释放。廖中一出狱时，煤建公司邵熙等已将其开除。廖中一因生活无着，只好返回原籍四川金堂县。路经陕西省南郑时，曾到南郑日报控诉。南郑日报把他所谈的材料转给了山西省商业厅。该厅负责干部对如此重大的问题不进行调查，仍根据煤建分公司邵熙等人的片面之词，答复了南郑日报。在“三反”运动中这个事件始基本上被查清，山西省人民政府并派人把廖中一接回太原。
    在报告了“廖中一事件”经过后，中国煤业建筑器材公司山西省分公司业务科长（前业务股长）李来堂、秘书科副科长韩治华（前人事股副股长）、商业厅人事科长贾毓芝、保卫股董锦章、公安厅保卫处长刘九祥等，都进行了初步检讨。
    裴丽生主席根据大家的发言，对如何接受这一事件的教训，彻底追查责任，认真地克服官僚主义错误，改进工作，巩固“三反”运动的成果等问题，作了指示。他要求和这一事件有关的人员都要切实反省。
    会议最后决定由省人民政府节约检查委员会组成处理“廖中一事件”工作组，并派人前往慰问廖中一。
