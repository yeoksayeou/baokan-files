Minister of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, Xie Juezai's Letter of Greeting to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, Wounded and Sick Soldiers, and Families of Martyrs and Soldiers

Respected Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, Wounded and Sick Soldiers, and Families of Martyrs and Soldiers!

The great 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day is approaching. You have made immortal contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend Eastern and world peace. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government, extend my highest respect and cordial greetings to you.

Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! You have made outstanding contributions to the cause of people's liberation in various revolutionary periods and in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and played a significant role in consolidating national defense and building a modern national defense force. You have not only protected the security of the motherland, but also created amazing miracles in economic and cultural construction such as river management, road construction, and literacy campaigns. The people of the whole country are launching a patriotic production competition to improve the level of industrial and agricultural production and strengthen national defense to support you. The people of the whole country care for and respect your families as they would their own parents, siblings. Under the education of patriotic resist-US-aggression and aid-Korea campaign, the vast majority of people take doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers as their glorious task. In order to make the land cultivated on their behalf yield more grain, various localities have launched a production increase competition this year, guaranteeing their lives. I hope you will study hard, continue to advance towards culture, master modern military technology, and strive to consolidate national defense! Be vigilant at all times against imperialist aggressors! Fight to defend the security of the motherland and protect the sacred territory, territorial waters, and airspace! Fight to defend Eastern and world peace!

Families of martyrs and soldiers! You have sacrificed your children and husbands for the liberation of the people and the security of the motherland, and are good examples for the people of the country. You have also actively responded to the government's call, participated in various production tasks, and many models have emerged, earning the respect of the people. I would like to express to you that the People's Government will further improve the work of preferential treatment, so that your production and life can be improved as they should be. I hope that you will continue to work hard and make better achievements, and strive to produce more models when evaluating models in various places after the autumn harvest this year.

Comrades Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers! Comrades Wounded and Sick Soldiers! You were gloriously wounded in action for the cause of human liberation, and have become ill from overwork. The People's Government is working hard to improve your medical and recuperation conditions. People's governments at all levels are strengthening the education work of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in order to train a large number of you to become outstanding cadres for the country's various construction tasks. I hope you will study hard, maintain your honor, and strive to improve your cultural level and recover your health as soon as possible!

On this day commemorating the great "August 1st" Army Day, let us shout:

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting the country and defending world peace!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the creator and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs Minister Xie Juezai
