    Xinhua News Agency, July 15th dispatch from Singapore: The British colonialists' criminal policy of forcibly relocating 500,000 overseas Chinese and Malayan residents into "new villages" in Malaya not only directly and severely damaged the economy of the relocated overseas Chinese, but has also worsened the lives of all the Malayan people. According to a white paper published last month by the British colonial government of Malaya: Because the British imperialists burned many overseas Chinese villages, deprived overseas Chinese farmers of their cultivated land, and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese farmers engaged in farming and pig raising in "new villages," the area of coarse grain cultivation in Malaya in 1951 decreased by 30 percent compared with 1948, while vegetable imports from other places increased by 70 percent during the same period; grain production was seriously affected, and grain prices rose; the production of many rubber plantations came to a standstill. The white paper admits that this policy has already caused the evil consequences of inflation.

    英政府迫害华侨的罪恶政策
    使马来亚人民生活更加恶化
    【新华社十五日讯】新加坡消息：英国殖民者在马来亚所施行的强迫五十万华侨和马来亚居民迁入“移民营”的罪恶政策，不独使被迫迁移的华侨在经济上直接遭受到严重的损害，并且已经使马来亚全体人民的生活更加恶化。据马来亚英国殖民政府在上月发表的白皮书透露：由于英帝国主义者焚毁了许多华侨村庄，剥夺了华侨农民的耕地，把数十万从事耕种和养猪的华侨农民关进“移民营”里，一九五一年马来亚的杂粮耕地面积已较一九四八年减少了百分之三十，而同期内从外地输入的蔬菜则增加了百分之七十；粮食生产受到严重影响，粮价上涨；许多橡胶园的生产陷于停顿。白皮书承认，这种政策已经造成了通货膨胀的恶果。
