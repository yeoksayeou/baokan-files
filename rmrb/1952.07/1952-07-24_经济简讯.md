	Sikang Provincial Department Store Rewards Outstanding Sales Workers
	The Sikang Provincial Company of the China Department Store awarded a group of outstanding sales workers on the 12th of this month. Thanks to the efforts of all its staff, the company set a record of exceeding its sales plan for three consecutive quarters, from the fourth quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, among department stores in various provinces in the Southwest region. More than 30 outstanding sales workers emerged, and their characteristic was to actively respond to the call of the leadership and proactively come up with various effective methods in their work, thus selling a large number of goods. For example, Bai Chonghua, the business section chief of the business department, often used work breaks to go out for sales. In the fourth quarter of last year, he sold more than 100 million yuan of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and building materials, and promoted the establishment of regular purchasing and sales relationships between purchasing agencies and the company. After the company promoted this proactive sales method, the sales scope was greatly expanded.
	Taiyuan Public Factories and Mines Strengthen Safety and Hygiene Work
	In order to ensure the smooth progress of the production increase and economy campaign, public factories and mines in Taiyuan have strengthened safety and hygiene work. The nine provincial-run factories and mines in the city received 1.28 billion yuan in appropriations from the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government in June, as a key solution for medical and health and production safety equipment. In mid-June, municipal factories and mines also held general meetings of employee representatives and trade union member representatives to accept safety and health suggestions from the working masses that urgently needed to be resolved and could be resolved. They universally distributed DDT to employees, prepared summer medicines, and ensured that each workshop had sufficient tea, mung bean water, and physiological saline, etc. In particular, various heavy industrial factories and mines have generally strengthened the health care work of workers. For example, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has opened health stations in four high-temperature workshops, and Xishan Coal Mine and Taiyuan Machine Factory are building nutrition canteens; Xishan Coal Mine has decided to establish an amateur sanatorium, and the newly built amateur sanatorium of Taiyuan Machine Factory began to receive workers for recuperation on "July 1st."
