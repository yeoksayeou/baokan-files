	Jingxi Datai Mine Should Ensure Safe Production
	To the Editor: The administrative leaders of the Jingxi Datai Mine have serious bureaucratic work styles and do not care about the safety and lives of workers, resulting in work-related injuries and deaths. For example, the well platform (made of wood) of Muchengjian in the mine was rotten. Workers made several rationalization proposals, but Mine Director Yuan ignored them, and an accident finally occurred, crushing the well-inspecting worker Zhao Changhui to death. Furthermore, the workers have repeatedly suggested that the administration buy boilers to boil water, but the administration has not resolved this issue in a timely manner, causing most workers to suffer from dysentery due to drinking cold water. Some workers were unable to work due to severe illness, which affected production. In addition, one of the mine's toilets is built outside the window of the kitchen, and another is built next to the road. We believe that these phenomena are also extremely unreasonable. We hope that the Jingxi Mining Bureau will promptly investigate and deal with this matter, and that the administrative leaders of the Datai Mine will make a profound self-criticism.

### 京西大台矿应保证安全生产

    京西大台矿应保证安全生产
    编辑同志：京西大台矿行政领导方面有严重的官僚主义作风，不关心工人安全和生活，致发生工人伤亡事故。例如该矿木成涧的井盘（木制）已经腐烂，工人几次提出合理化建议，袁矿长置之不理，终于发生了事故，把看眼工人赵长会砸死。又如工人曾几次建议行政买锅炉烧开水，行政上没有及时解决这个问题，使大部工人因喝冷水而闹痢疾，有的工人因病势严重不能上班，影响了生产。此外，这个矿的厕所有一个修在厨房的窗外，有一个修在道路旁边。我们认为这些现象也是极不合理的。我们希望京西矿务局迅速调查处理，并望大台矿行政领导方面作深刻检讨。    河北省宛平县总工会
