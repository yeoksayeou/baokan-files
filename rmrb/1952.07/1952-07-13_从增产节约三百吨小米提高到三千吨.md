    The Du Kunshan team of the Sifang Railway Factory under the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has revised its annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy twice this year; now, the 1952 plan for increasing production and practicing economy has been formulated after supplementary revisions. The annual goal for increasing production and practicing economy has been raised from the original value of 300 tons of millet to 3,000 tons.
    The entire process of the Du Kunshan team revising the plan for increasing production and practicing economy is a process of the entire team of workers breaking down conservative and complacent ideas, actively using their brains, and continuously exploring potential capabilities. This new and advanced plan for increasing production and practicing economy has not only powerfully promoted the movement for increasing production and practicing economy in the factory, but also set a brilliant example for the popular upsurge in the movement for increasing production and practicing economy in Qingdao.
    The Du Kunshan team is a production team in the iron casting section of the Sifang Railway Factory, manufacturing accessories for locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars. It has won the glorious red flag of the factory's "Model Rationalization Proposal Team." In January of this year, after discussing the call to "increase production and practice strict economy," the Du Kunshan team initially formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy with a value of 300 tons of millet in 1952, based on conditions such as submitting ten rationalization proposals per month by the entire team and ensuring that the quality of the castings reached 95% or higher. This plan immediately received the attention and praise of the factory's trade union. Although the team's plan was formulated, at that time, some people in the team lacked a correct understanding of the significance of the movement for increasing production and practicing economy. In addition, the bureaucratic leadership and the sabotage of embezzlers caused most or the main parts of the rationalization proposals to be stockpiled, which once made them lose confidence. Some workers said privately, "What's the point of increasing production and practicing economy? Just keep your head down and do your work." Others said, "Three hundred tons of millet will probably be difficult to complete!" At that time, Du Kunshan was conducting persuasion and mobilization work within the team on the one hand, and on the other hand, he was leading everyone to use their brains to find "tricks." Soon, many amazing things happened in the team. For example, when making "pulley frames," some workers initially thought that there were no "tricks" to be found in this work. When it gradually increased from making twelve boxes per day to one hundred and fifty-three boxes per day, some people thought, "It's reached the top. Even gods can't increase it anymore!" But then the sand-casting leak plate method was adopted. In the past, two people worked, and the highest output in a day was one hundred and fifty-three boxes. Now, one person can make one hundred and sixty boxes a day. These vivid facts deeply inspired the entire team of workers, and workers with conservative ideas or lack of confidence began to change.
    In the later period of the "Three-Anti" movement, Wang Jibo, a sand-casting worker and labor model in the Du Kunshan team, became the deputy director of the sand-casting workshop; then, the work style of the leading cadres also underwent great changes. The rationalization proposals that had been stockpiled were approved, and the new workshop director and the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of the workshop personally came to the team to understand the difficulties of the workers in production. They also studied the improvement of production tools with the workers, and the entire team of workers became even more delighted. From then on, whenever the workers rested and ate, they gathered together to study ways to improve production technology. Once, Du Kunshan was checking materials in the workshop and found some passenger car chair frames made of angle iron placed there. He thought, "If this thing is made with malleable iron instead, wouldn't it save labor and reduce costs?" He returned to the team and studied and experimented with the entire team of workers, and proposed a rationalization proposal to modify the chair frame. They immediately received support from the leadership. This initiative not only reduced the cost of the passenger car chair frame by 45%, but also saved the country the value of 80 tons of millet throughout the year. Some workers felt that there was still more potential to be tapped and that they should make more effort. Du Kunshan also thought: Modifying the chair frame alone can increase production and save 80 tons of millet. If ten such rationalization proposals are put forward, wouldn't that be 800 tons? Finally, he made up his mind: He must break down the conservative idea that "production has reached the top" and lead the entire team to raise the annual goal of struggle - the plan for increasing production and practicing economy - a step further. In April, he first consulted with the workshop director, and then returned to the team to hold a team meeting. At the team meeting, everyone exchanged opinions and analyzed the team's favorable conditions. Finally, the entire team revised the original plan; in the plan, they added conditions such as using malleable iron instead of non-ferrous metals to make various accessories for various locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, and trial-producing black heart malleable iron. The plan after this revision has been more than doubled compared to the original plan, requiring an increase in production and savings of 1,000 tons of millet throughout the year!
    In early June, after Du Kunshan attended the Qingdao Municipal State-owned and Public-owned Factories and Enterprises Mobilization Meeting for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, he conveyed the resolutions and spirit of the meeting in the team: To overcome conservative and complacent ideas, the formulation of plans must be closely combined with finding tricks and making rationalization proposals, and advanced plans for increasing production and practicing economy must be formulated. At that time, a complacent mood was generally growing in the team, and everyone felt that "our team has improved a lot!" In fact, if the iron output in April was used as the base, the production in May had increased by 15%. And great achievements have also been made in improving technology and improving product quality. For example, passenger and freight car parts made of copper or other non-ferrous metals in the past have been mostly manufactured with malleable iron instead through the initiative and improvement of the entire team of workers. Just the lamp panels on passenger cars alone can save 40 tons of millet throughout the year. For example, in the past, various pipe fittings made of black heart malleable iron on passenger and freight cars were all purchased from abroad, and the cost was very high. After the entire team successfully trial-produced black heart malleable iron, it replaced foreign goods, saving the country a huge amount of wealth. At this time, the team leader Du Kunshan was also not sure about the production of the entire team. He hesitated in the face of the generally growing complacency in the entire team. After some debate, and based on the existing manpower, material resources, equipment, and everyone's technical conditions, they carefully calculated according to working hours. This time, the entire team of workers jumped up excitedly. It turned out that new clues were found in the calculation. Many tons of iron can be produced every month, which is 30% higher than the output in May. At this time, Du Kunshan also thought that this plan had increased nearly doubled compared to the output in April, and it could not be said that it was not advanced. He told the administrative responsible cadres of the sand-casting workshop about this plan, but unexpectedly, the deputy director of the workshop Wang Jibo and the trade union负责人 carefully considered it and replied to him: "Your plan is a conservative plan!"
    "The director said our plan is a conservative plan! Our plan has already increased by 30% compared to the output in May. How can it not be an advanced plan?" At first, the thinking of the entire team of workers could not be reversed, and Du Kunshan was also a little depressed. Deputy Director of the Workshop Wang Jibo, the Party Branch Secretary, and the trade union cadres all came to the Du Kunshan team in person. On the one hand, they specifically helped and enlightened everyone's thinking, and on the other hand, they studied and improved the plan with the entire team of workers. Wang Jibo said, "If you want to improve our plan for increasing production and practicing economy, you must break down conservative and complacent ideas, use your brains more, think of ways while formulating plans, and see if it can still be improved. The plan you formulated is still based on the original experience, the original methods, and the original set of plans, so it is called a conservative plan!" After repeated enlightenment and mobilization, the thinking of the entire team of workers was cleared. They conducted a new discussion, and the next day they found new tricks from adjusting the labor organization and other aspects. Originally, there were nine people in this team making sand molds, plus one apprentice. In the past, they worked in one package, which wasted working hours and could not guarantee quality. After everyone's research, everyone was scientifically divided and contracted to do one kind of work according to their technical expertise. When pouring molten iron, they were divided into three groups and took turns to alternate. In this way, sixty-three working hours can be saved every month, and production can be increased. Everyone also put forward rationalization proposals such as sand-casting to improve metal tires and using cement to pave the workshop floor. If these rationalization proposals are implemented, plus guaranteeing to put forward ten rationalization proposals every month, etc., output can still be increased. Through this discussion, everyone's confidence was further enhanced. Team leader Lan Xizhang said: "The director is right. The plan we formulated is indeed still a conservative plan. We were blinded by some minor achievements, and we can no longer see that there are still many potential new things in our team!" After this effort by the Du Kunshan team, the entire team conducted a second revision of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, raising the annual goal of struggle to a value of 3,000 tons of millet. Among them, the item of replacing non-ferrous metal parts with malleable iron alone will save the country wealth worth 1,387 tons of millet. In addition, the reduction of the scrap rate, the saving of working hours, the reduction of machining allowance, and the saving of coal can also save the value of 660 tons of millet. This new plan broke through the old norms in this way, and continued to rise at an alarming rate.
    In order to ensure the realization of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the entire team also formulated a "Patriotic Labor Competition Pact." They also formulated quarterly, monthly, and weekly plans based on the annual plan; at the same time, the entire team also proposed to strengthen unity and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to supervise the implementation of the plan mutually.

    从增产节约三百吨小米提高到三千吨
    新华社记者    台旭
    中央人民政府铁道部所属四方铁路工厂杜崑山小组，今年上半年前后修订了两次全年的增产节约计划；现在经过补充修正后的一九五二年增产节约计划已经订出来了；全年的增产节约奋斗目标已从原来价值三百吨小米提高到三千吨。
    杜崑山小组修订增产节约计划的整个过程，是全组工人打破保守自满思想、积极开动脑筋、不断地发掘潜在能力的过程。这一新的先进的增产节约计划，不仅有力地推动了该厂的增产节约运动，并为青岛市正在普遍高涨的增产节约运动树立了光辉的榜样。
    杜崑山小组是四方铁路工厂翻砂场马铁部制造机车、货车、客车配件的生产小组，曾获得过全厂“模范合理化建议小组”的光荣红旗。今年一月间，杜崑山小组在讨论“增加生产，厉行节约”的号召后，初步根据全组每月提合理化建议十件，使马铁质量达到百分之九十五以上等条件，全厂第一个订出了一九五二年增产节约价值三百吨小米的计划。这一个计划当即受到该厂工会的重视和表扬。小组计划虽然订出来了，当时组里还有一部分人对增产节约运动的意义缺乏正确认识，再加上领导干部官僚主义和贪污分子把持和破坏，提出的合理化建议大部分或其中主要部分被积压下来，曾使他们失去信心。有些工人背地里说：“搞什么增产节约，焖着头干就得了。”也有说：“三百吨小米恐怕难完成！”那时，杜崑山一面在组内进行说服动员工作，另一面带动大家开动脑筋找“窍门”。不久，组里出现了许多惊人的事迹。如做“滑轮框”时，开头有的工人认为这个活无“窍门”可找。当从每天做十二箱，逐步提高到每天做一百五十三箱的时候，又有人认为：“可到顶了，就是神仙也不能再把它提高了！”但又采用了翻砂漏板法，过去两人干活，一天最高产量一百五十三箱，现在一人干，一天就可以做一百六十箱了。这些活生生的事实，深刻地启发了全组工人，有着保守思想或者缺乏信心的工人开始转变了。
    “三反”运动后期，杜崑山小组里的翻砂工、劳动模范王继伯当上了翻砂场的副主任；接着领导干部作风也有了很大的转变。原来被积压下来的合理化建议批准了，新的场主任和中国共产党该场支部书记亲自来组里了解工人生产中的困难。他们并和工人们一起研究改良生产工具，全组工人越加欢欣起来。从此，组里工人们每当休息和吃饭的时候，都凑在一起研究办法改进生产技术。有一次，杜崑山在现场里查看物料，发现有一些用三角铁制成的客车椅子架搁在那里，他想：“这东西要以马铁来代替制作，不是又省工又能降低成本吗？”他回到组里和全组工人一起进行研究和试验，就提出改制椅子架的合理化建议来，他们马上得到领导方面的支持。这一创议不仅使客车椅子架的成本降低了百分之四十五，而且全年能给国家节省价值八十吨小米。有些工人感到还有更多潜力没有挖出来，应该再使把劲。杜崑山又想到：改制椅子架这一项就能增产节约八十吨小米，要是提上这样十个合理化建议，不就是八百吨吗？最后他下了决心：必须打破“生产到了顶”的保守思想，带动全组把全年的奋斗目标——增产节约计划提高一步。四月间，他首先找场主任商量，又回到组里召开了小组会，在小组会上大家交换了意见，分析了全组的有利条件，最后全组动手把原有的计划进行了修正；在计划中，增添了以马铁代替有色金属制做各种机车、客车、货车上的各种配件，试制黑心马铁等条件。经这次修正后的计划已比原来的计划提高了两倍多，要求在全年内增产节约达到一千吨小米！
    六月上旬，杜崑山参加了青岛市国营公营工厂企业增产节约动员大会回来以后，就在小组里传达了大会的决议和精神：要克服保守自满思想，订计划要和找窍门、提合理化建议密切地结合起来，订出先进的增产节约计划来。当时，组里已经普遍滋长着一种自满的情绪，大家都感觉到：“咱组已经提高不少啦！”实际上，该组如以四月份的出铁量做为基数，五月份的生产已提高了百分之十五。并且在改进技术，提高产品质量方面也做出很大的成绩。如过去以铜或铁等有色金属制做的客、货车用件，经全组工人的倡议和改良，大部以马铁代替制造，仅其中客车上的灯盘子等，全年就能节约四十吨小米。又如过去客、货车上用黑心马铁制做的各种管接，一律从外国购买，成本很高；经全组试制黑心马铁成功，代替了外货，为国家节省下一笔巨大的财富。这时，组长杜崑山对全组的生产心中也是没有数的，在全组普遍滋长的自满情绪面前倒犹豫起来了。经过一番争论后，又根据全组现有的人力、物力、设备以及每人的技术条件，按照工时详细地核计了一下，这一会可把全组工人兴奋的跳起来了，原来从核计中又找到新的线索，每月可增产很多吨铁，比五月份的产量提高百分之三十。这时杜崑山也以为这个计划比起四月份的产量来已提高了将近一倍，不能说不先进，就向翻砂场行政负责干部谈出了这个计划，却料想不到场副主任王继伯和工会负责人仔细一考虑，给他的答复是：“你们这计划是个保守计划！”
    “主任说咱们是个保守计划！咱这计划已经比五月份的产量提高了百分之三十了，怎能不是先进计划呢？”开头全组工人的思想都扭不过弯来，杜崑山也有点闷闷不乐。场副主任王继伯、党支部书记和工会干部都亲自来到杜崑山小组，一面具体地帮助和打通大家的思想，一面和全组工人一起研究改进计划。王继伯说：“要想把我们的增产节约计划提高，必须打破保守自满思想，多开动脑筋，一边想办法，一边订计划，看看是不是还能提高。你们订的那个计划，还是根据原有的经验、原有的方法、原有的一套订出来的，所以叫保守计划！”经过反复地启发动员，全组工人思想打通了，他们重新进行了讨论，第二天就从调整劳动组织等方面找到了新的窍门。原来这组里做砂模的共九人，另外还有学徒一人，过去一揽子干活，既浪费工时，又不能保证质量。经大家研究，每人都进行了科学的分工，按每人技术特长包做一种活；在倒铁水时就分成三组，轮流交替进行。这样，每月能节省出六十三个工时，并可提高生产。大家又提出翻砂改进金属胎型和场房用洋灰铺地等合理化建议，如果这几项合理化建议实行了，再加上每月保证提十项合理化建议等等，还可以提高产量。通过这一讨论，大家更加增进了信心。工长蓝锡章说：“主任说得很对，咱订的那个计划确实还是保守计划，咱被一些微小的成绩迷住了眼，再也看不到咱组里还有很多潜在的新东西！”杜崑山小组经过这一番努力，全组又进行了第二次的修订增产节约计划，将全年的奋斗目标提高到价值三千吨小米。其中仅以马铁代替有色金属制件一项，将为国家节约财富价值一千三百八十七吨小米，此外在降低废品率、节省工时、减少加工余量以及节省用煤等方面亦可节省价值六百六十吨小米。这一新的计划就这样突破了旧有的规范，以惊人的速度不断地上升着。
    该组为了保证增产节约计划的实现，全组又订立了“爱国劳动竞赛公约”，他们并根据全年的计划，订出了季度、月度和每周的计划；同时全组又提出加强团结，运用批评与自我批评的武器以相互监督计划的执行。
