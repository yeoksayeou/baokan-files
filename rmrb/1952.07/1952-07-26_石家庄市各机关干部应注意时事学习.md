    Cadres in Shijiazhuang City Organs Should Pay Attention to Current Affairs Learning
    Editor: Cadres in organs in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, generally neglect reading newspapers and studying. Many cadres are indifferent to domestic and international current affairs, and the political atmosphere in the organs is very thin. In the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Cooperative, of the 90+ cadres, only about half read the newspaper, and most of them only look at the headlines. In the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, the Railway Factory, and other organs, even fewer cadres read the newspaper carefully. Generally, people just glance at the headlines. Many people reflect that "when tasks are tight, they can't even look at the headlines." Recently, the Railway Factory, the Coking Plant, the Municipal Taxation Bureau, the Municipal Cooperative, the various organs and groups in the First District, the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Cooperative, and the Shijiazhuang Higher Industrial School, among other units, universally held a current affairs quiz. The results showed that 50-70% of the people failed. The ignorance of many people regarding current affairs is alarming. For example, the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have been carried out nationwide for half a year, and various organs in Shijiazhuang City have also carried out this movement and achieved great results; however, some cadres are completely ignorant of the significance of this movement and certain important policy issues. In the quiz, more than 80% of the cadres in the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Cooperative and the Coking Plant could not answer or could not fully answer what the "five poisons" were. After the "Three-Anti" movement, various factories and enterprises in the city launched a production increase competition, but most of the cadres in the Railway Factory, the Coking Plant, and the Municipal Cooperative, among other units, were unclear about their unit's production tasks, and many responsible cadres in production work could not answer the questions. Their understanding of these important issues closely related to their own work is so vague, and it is easy to imagine their knowledge of other current affairs issues. More than 90% of the people in the Prefecture Cooperative and the Railway Factory could not fully answer the questions about the Jingjiang River diversion project, and more than 80% of the people in the Municipal Cooperative had a superficial understanding of this issue and lacked the necessary understanding. Shijiazhuang City held a mass rally to protest the French Binet government's unreasonable arrest of Jacques Duclos, secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and the vast majority of the masses knew about this, but some individual cadres did not. Many people also did not know about the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference preparatory meeting, the first communist construction project of the Soviet Union, and other issues. This situation shows that the tendency of cadres in Shijiazhuang City organs to neglect politics is very serious.

    The main reason for the above phenomenon is that the leading cadres of these organs do not pay enough attention to cadres' reading newspapers and studying, and lack leadership. After the "Three-Anti" movement, some organs, under the pretext of "saving," universally reduced the number of newspaper subscriptions, and there were not enough newspapers to read, which is also a reason. In addition, the lack of guaranteed study time in various organs has also affected cadres' current affairs learning. Of course, the tendency of some cadres themselves to neglect politics is serious, but if the leading cadres of various organs care about the political life of cadres and strengthen the leadership of the staff in reading newspapers and studying, this situation will change.

### 石家庄市各机关干部应注意时事学习

    石家庄市各机关干部应注意时事学习
    编辑同志：河北省石家庄市机关干部普遍地忽视读报学习。很多干部对国内国外的时事问题漠不关心，机关里的政治空气十分稀薄。石家庄专区合作总社有九十多个干部，其中看报的人不过半数，这些人绝大部分只看看大标题。石家庄炼焦厂、铁路工厂及其他机关的干部，认真读报的更少了。一般人都是走马观花地看看标题。很多人反映说：“任务一紧，连大标题也不能看。”最近铁路工厂、炼焦厂、市税务局、市合作总社、第一区各机关团体、石家庄专区合作总社和石家庄高等工业学校等单位，普遍地举行了一次时事测验。测验结果，百分之五十——七十的人不及格。许多人对于时事问题的无知是惊人的。例如，伟大的“三反”
    “五反”运动在全国进行了半年，石家庄市各机关也开展了这个运动，并且取得了很大的成绩；但是，有些干部对这个运动的意义和某些重要的政策问题，竟至全然无知。在测验中，石家庄专区合作总社和炼焦厂有百分之八十以上的干部对“五毒”答不出或者答不完全。“三反”运动以后，市各工厂、企业单位都开展了增产竞赛运动，但是铁路工厂、炼焦厂、市合作总社等单位的大部分干部对本单位的生产任务都弄不清楚，其中有不少生产工作中的负责干部，也答不上来。他们对于这些和本身工作有密切关系的重要问题，认识得如此模糊，对其他时事问题更可想而知了。专区合作总社、铁路工厂有百分之九十以上的人对荆江分洪工程问题答不完全，市合作总社有百分之八十以上的人对这个问题一知半解，缺乏应有的认识。石家庄市曾开群众大会，抗议法国比内政府无理逮捕法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛，极大多数群众都知道这件事，但有个别的干部却不知道。对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议、苏联第一个共产主义建设工程等问题，也有很多人不知道。这种情况说明，石家庄市机关干部忽视政治的倾向，是十分严重的。
    产生上述现象的主要原因是这些机关的领导干部对干部读报学习不够重视，缺乏领导。“三反”运动以后，有些机关藉口“节约”，普遍地减订报纸，报纸不够看，也是一个原因。此外，各机关学习时间没有保证，也影响了干部的时事学习。当然，某些干部本身忽视政治的倾向是严重的，但是如果各机关领导干部关心干部的政治生活，加强对机关工作人员读报学习的领导，这种情况是会改变的。
