    Notice from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Adjusting People's Scholarships for Students in National Universities and Secondary Schools

    For the past three years, the treatment of students in national universities and secondary schools has generally implemented a system of People's Scholarships of a certain amount, and a few have implemented a system of full-coverage public funding. Due to certain historical reasons and limited financial resources, the treatment of students in the same grade and type of school often varies greatly; the standard of People's Scholarships in many schools is still difficult to solve the students' living difficulties. Now, in order to actively improve the health of young students and gradually unify the standards of student treatment, it is decided to change the public funding system for students in national universities and secondary schools to a People's Scholarship system, and to make appropriate adjustments to the original standards of People's Scholarships. The adjusted standards and implementation measures are as follows:

    I. From September 1952, the People's Scholarships for students in national universities, secondary schools, and worker-peasant elementary schools must be implemented in accordance with the newly stipulated standards (to be notified separately by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government). Individual regions (such as old liberated areas and ethnic minority areas) may appropriately increase this standard with reference to this standard.

    II. The People's Scholarship of all levels and types of schools should aim at appropriately solving students' food and other actual material difficulties. Except for ordinary middle schools, food expenses must be equally and universally distributed to every student; living allowances should be divided into several levels according to the specific economic conditions of those in need. The People's Scholarships for senior high schools and junior high schools should also be divided into several levels according to the specific economic conditions of those in need. The specific methods will be separately stipulated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.

    III. The grading of People's Scholarships for all levels and types of schools should be based on the currently promulgated standards and specific circumstances, and should be democratically evaluated by all students through self-reporting and public discussion, and finally approved by the school administration. During the evaluation, the actual difficulties of the children of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, worker-peasant cadres, industrial workers, ethnic minorities, and returned overseas Chinese should be taken into consideration as much as possible.

    IV. The standards of People's Scholarships for the same students in the same grade and type of schools in the same region (within the scope of major administrative regions or provinces and cities) must be consistent, and the living conditions should also be unified, and no special treatment is allowed. Local education administrative organs or schools may not change the standards of People's Scholarships without the approval of higher authorities.

    V. The funds for People's Scholarships for all levels and types of schools should be included in the school's regular expenses, and regular unified budgets and final accounts should be prepared, and special funds should be used for special purposes, and should not be arbitrarily misappropriated.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知
    三年以来，全国高等学校及中等学校的学生待遇，一般已实行一定款数的人民助学金制，少数已实行全部供给的公费制。由于若干历史原因，并为财政情况所限，同级同类学校学生待遇，常差别极大；人民助学金的标准在不少学校也还难于解决学生生活上的困难。现在为着积极改进青年学生健康状况，并逐步统一学生待遇的标准，决定将全国高等学校及中等学校学生的公费制一律改为人民助学金制，并对原有人民助学金的标准作适当的调整。调整后的标准及实施办法规定如下：
    一、自一九五二年九月份起，全国高等学校、中等学校及工农初等学校学生的人民助学金，须一律依照新规定的标准（由中央人民政府教育部另行通知）执行。个别地区（如老解放区和少数民族地区），得比照此项标准酌情提高。
    二、各级各类学校的人民助学金应以适当地解决学生的伙食和其他实际的物质困难为目的。除普通中学外，伙食费须同等地和普遍地发给每一个学生；生活津贴应按照需要者的各人具体经济情况，分为若干等级发给。高级中学和初级中学的人民助学金也应按照需要者的各人具体经济情况分为若干等级发给。其具体办法由中央人民政府教育部另行规定。
    三、各级各类学校人民助学金的等级的评定，应依据现所颁布的标准和具体情况，由全体学生自报公议，民主评定，最后由学校行政批准。在评定时，应尽量照顾革命烈属、革命军人、工农干部、产业工人、少数民族及归国华侨子女的实际困难。
    四、在同一地区内（以各大行政区或各省市为范围）同级同类学校同样学生的人民助学金的标准必须一致，生活待遇，也应划一，不许有所特殊。各地教育行政机关或学校，非经上级批准，不得自行改变人民助学金的标准。
    五、各级各类学校人民助学金款项，应列入学校经常费内，定期统一编造预决算，实行专款专用，不得任意挪用。
    总理周恩来
    一九五二年七月八日
