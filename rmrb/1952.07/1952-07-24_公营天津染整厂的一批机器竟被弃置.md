    A Batch of Machines at the Publicly Owned Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory are Abandoned
    Comrade Editor: The Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory, belonging to the Production Management Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, established a machine dyeing factory in Tashang Village, Jin County, Hebei Province in 1948. The factory's boilers, power, parts, etc., were complete and it was a modern factory. In November 1951, the factory sold the complete set of equipment and factory buildings for 700 million yuan (RMB) to the Production Section of the Logistics Department of the Hebei Provincial Military Region. The section then sent a Comrade Xing to take people to receive it, and the factory left Comrades Kang and Gu in charge of the handover. The people at the Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory felt that they had sold it too cheaply, so they moved away drawing instruments, tachometers, etc., before the handover. The receiver saw that the number of items handed over did not match the number on the list, and a dispute arose with the handover personnel, so all the handover procedures were not completed. At this time, the "Three-Anti" Movement began, and the handover work simply stopped. Comrade Xing of the Production Section of the Logistics Department of the Hebei Provincial Military Region and others then disassembled the machines, some were inventoried into the warehouse, and some were scattered and thrown in the house and yard. In March of this year, the Production Section of the Logistics Department of the Hebei Provincial Military Region sent a letter saying that the receiver should temporarily take care of it, and then handed over all the machines back to the Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory, which belongs to the Military Supply Department of the Logistics Department of the original North China Military Region. Because both sides were irresponsible, the boiler support machine, dryer, calender, car head, diesel engine, large and small power parts and accessories in this batch of machines were scattered and placed everywhere, and iron pipes, steam valves, and the like were thrown all over the house. When it rained heavily in June, these parts were still thrown in the yard. Comrade Xing, who was in charge of receiving the machines for the Production Section of the Logistics Department of the Hebei Provincial Military Region, reported this situation to his superiors, but the superiors did not reply. The Military Supply Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region also ignored it. Such equipment and factory buildings are left unattended, what a degree of irresponsibility the relevant leaders show towards state property! Now, the National Agency Production Disposal Committee has begun to clear up the assets of agency production. When Comrade Wang and others from the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce came to receive this batch of assets, it was difficult to carry out the receiving work because the factory's machines were scattered and disorganized.
    I suggest that the Military Supply Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region investigate the above-mentioned situation of irresponsibility towards state property, and immediately send personnel to assist in inventorying this batch of machines and transfer them to the Agency Production Clearance Committee as soon as possible, so as to prevent state property from continuing to suffer undue losses.

    公营天津染整厂的一批机器竟被弃置
    编辑同志：华北军区后勤部军需部生产管理处所属天津染整厂，一九四八年在河北省晋县塔上村建立了一个机染厂。这个厂的锅炉、动力、机件等都很完备，是一座现代化的工厂。一九五一年十一月，该厂把全套设备、厂房等折合人民币七亿元卖给河北省军区后勤部生产科。该科即派一姓邢的同志带人前来接收，该厂留下康、谷二同志负责移交。天津染整厂的人觉得卖得便宜了，便把绘图器、转数表等在移交前运走了。接收人见移交数目和清单上的数目不对，和移交人发生了争执，全部接交手续也就没有办清。这时候，“三反”运动开始了，接交工作便干脆停止。河北省军区后勤部生产科邢同志等便把机器拆散，有的清点入库，有的散乱地抛在屋里、院里。今年三月里，河北省军区后勤部生产科来信说让接收人暂时看管，继又把全部机器交还原华北军区后勤部军需部所属天津染整厂。由于双方互不负责，这批机器中的锅托机、干燥机、轧光机、汽车头、柴油机、大小动力机件和附属品等东倒西歪地被乱放在各处，铁管、汽门之类的更是满屋乱抛。六月下大雨时，仍然把这些机件扔在院里。河北省军区后勤部生产科负责接收的邢同志曾经把这种情况报告上级，但上级没有答覆。华北军区后勤部军需部也不睬不理。这样的设备、厂房被扔着不管，有关领导方面是何等地对国家资财不负责任！现在，全国性的机关生产处理委员会开始清理机关生产的资产，当河北省工商厅派王同志等前来接收这批资产时，因该厂机器散乱不堪，实在难于进行接收工作。
    我建议华北军区后勤部军需部检查上述对国家资财不负责任的情况，并马上派员协助清点这批机器，尽速移交机关生产清理委员会，以免国家资财继续受到不应有的损失。
