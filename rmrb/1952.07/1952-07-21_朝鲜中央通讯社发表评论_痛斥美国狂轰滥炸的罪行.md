Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th (via TASS): The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the recent atrocities committed by US aggressors in the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents in northern Korea, stating: The US aggressors are using every means to deceive world opinion, trying to make the global public believe that US planes only bombed and strafed military targets, and that this bombing was entirely out of military necessity. However, the statements of these rumour-mongering experts, who have proven themselves to be incompetent, are complete lies. The result of the bombing proves that it was purely a criminal act of slaughtering peaceful residents.

What is the purpose of the US aggressors committing these new atrocities in the rear of the Republic? The commentary pointed out: The US military is committing these new atrocities to compensate, by the most despicable and shameless means, for the shameful military failures they have suffered on the front lines and the failure of their arrogant and foolish policies in the negotiations.

The commentary pointed out: The recent atrocities committed by US imperialists in northern Korea clearly prove that the imperialists do not want to achieve peace in Korea, but want to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war. One proof is that, while barbarously bombing the Pyongyang area, the US Air Force also violated the Korean-Chinese border and bombed and strafed the Andong area.

The commentary concluded: The Korean people indignantly condemn the recent atrocities of the US aggressors. No heinous acts by the US interventionists can intimidate the Korean people or force them to submit. US imperialists must bear full responsibility for the crimes they have committed in Korea and Northeast China. If the US imperialists insist on expanding the war, they cannot escape the fate of final destruction.

    朝鲜中央通讯社发表评论
    痛斥美国狂轰滥炸的罪行
    【本报讯】新华社据塔斯社平壤十九日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社就美国侵略者最近对朝鲜北部和平居民进行狂轰滥炸的暴行发表评论说：美国侵略者正在用千方百计来欺骗世界舆论，想使全世界公众相信美国飞机只轰炸和扫射了军事目标，进行这次轰炸完全是出于军事上的必要。可是，已证明本领没有到家的造谣专家的这种说法完全是骗人的谎话。轰炸的结果证明：这次轰炸纯粹是一种残杀和平居民的罪恶行为。
    美国侵略者在共和国后方干这种新暴行的目的是什么呢？评论指出：美国军队干这种新暴行是想用这种最卑鄙无耻的手段，来补偿他们在前线上所遭受的可耻的军事失败和他们在谈判中采取的骄横而愚蠢的政策的失败。
    评论指出：美帝国主义者最近在朝鲜北部犯下的这种种暴行，清楚地证明帝国主义者不希望实现朝鲜和平，而想破坏谈判，扩大战争。一个证明是：美国空军在野蛮轰炸平壤地区的同时，还侵犯朝中边界，炸射安东地区。
    评论最后说：朝鲜人民愤慨地谴责美国侵略者最近的暴行。美国干涉者的任何穷凶极恶的行为，都吓不倒朝鲜人民，都不能强迫他们屈膝。美帝国主义者必须对他们在朝鲜和中国东北所犯的罪行负完全责任。如果美帝国主义者一味想扩大战争，他们逃不了最后灭亡的命运。
