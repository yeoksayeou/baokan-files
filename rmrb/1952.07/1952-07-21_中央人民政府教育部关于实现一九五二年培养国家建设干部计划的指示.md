    Instruction of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on Realizing the 1952 Plan for Training National Construction Cadres
    As the national construction undertaking is unfolding day by day, training a large number of high-level and mid-level construction talents is an urgent political task. To this end, educational administrative departments at all levels must lead their subordinate schools to strive to realize the 1952 plan for training national construction cadres. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, in order to do a good job in various tasks, the Ministry hereby issues the following instructions regarding the enrollment work, construction equipment, and teacher allocation of schools at all levels:
    1.  Strictly implementing unified enrollment in colleges and secondary schools across the country is the key to realizing this year's plan for training national construction cadres. Since there are fewer senior and junior high school graduates this year, while the enrollment quotas for colleges and secondary schools are relatively large, if unified enrollment is not implemented, there will be chaotic phenomena of indiscriminately recruiting and attracting students, and it may be difficult for higher normal schools and secondary normal schools to guarantee the completion of their enrollment plans. In order to avoid the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena, unified enrollment committees must be organized in all regions this year
    (schools led by local enterprise departments must participate in all cases), and students should be allocated in a unified manner in accordance with the national cadre training plan, in order to realize the planned and step-by-step cadre training plan. In order to ensure that colleges, especially higher and secondary normal schools, complete their established enrollment plans and recruit a certain number of junior and senior high school graduates, all middle schools should, in addition to regularly conducting patriotic ideological education for students in advance, also strengthen the guidance of students' ideas about further education, mobilize and organize some students to apply for normal schools, and mobilize students to respond enthusiastically to the call of the motherland to go to the posts most needed by the country. Students should realize that only in this way is it the most glorious and the concrete manifestation of true patriotism. When allocating students, contact should be made with relevant parties in other regions so that enrollment work can be carried out smoothly (see the enrollment plan drafted by the Ministry for details).
    2.  Regarding the construction equipment of schools at all levels, we must adopt the method of making do with simple means, focusing on adding classes to existing schools and supplementing with building new schools. Due to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, construction organizations in various places have been disrupted, construction funds are limited, and time is very pressing. If the construction equipment of schools at all levels does not adopt the method of making do with simple means, focusing on adding classes, supplementing with building new schools, and making full use of existing equipment and school buildings, such as selecting primary schools with better conditions to add junior high school classes, technical classes, and normal school classes, junior high schools to add senior high school classes, junior normal schools to add secondary normal school classes, implementing a two-shift system in cities, and using temples, public houses, and houses confiscated during land reform in rural areas to solve the school building problem, and considering from various aspects, it will be difficult to solve the school building problem in time.
    3.  In order to complete this year's cadre training plan, the following methods must be adopted to solve the problem of teachers:
    (1) Vigorously promote the method of taking talents locally and promoting them level by level to solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers in schools at all levels, such as promoting excellent senior primary school teachers to junior high school teachers, promoting junior high school teachers to senior high school teachers, and promoting junior normal school teachers to normal school teachers, and so on.
    (2) When distributing this year's senior high school and normal school graduates during the summer vacation, various places should select outstanding ones according to the allocated quotas to stay in school as trainee teachers or political instructors.
    (3) Middle school staff with the equivalent of senior high school and specialized degrees may be appropriately reassigned as teachers.
    (4) Appropriately increase the number of teaching hours for teachers, such as adopting the method of combining classes to teach large classes for certain courses, and minimize teachers' extracurricular burden as much as possible to free up time for teaching.
    (5) Recruit unemployed intellectuals, provide them with short-term training, and then employ them as teachers (the overall national plan will be notified separately).
    In short, educational administrative departments at all levels should, according to the needs of national construction, conscientiously supervise and urge their subordinate schools to use revolutionary spirit and methods, promote the spirit of creation, be meticulous in planning and strict in budgeting, do more things with less money, and maximize the utilization and potential of manpower and material resources in order to realize the national cadre training plan.
    In order to ensure that work is carried out in an organized manner, a strict reporting system must be established. All districts should report the progress of work and difficulties to the Ministry in a timely manner so that we can assist in solving them.

    中央人民政府教育部关于实现一九五二年培养国家建设干部计划的指示
    由于国家建设事业日益展开，培养大量高级和中级建设人才是迫切的政治任务。为此，各级教育行政部门必须领导所属学校努力实现一九五二年培养国家建设干部的计划。现暑假即到，为了做好各项工作，关于各级学校的招生工作、修建设备、师资调配等问题，本部特作如下指示：
    一、各地高等学校和中等学校严格地实行统一招生，是实现今年培养国家建设干部计划的关键。由于今年高中和初中毕业生较少，而高等学校和中等学校招生数量较大，如不实行统一招生，将会发生乱招乱拉学生的现象，并可能使高等师范学校和中等师范学校难于保证完成招生计划。为避免发生上述混乱现象，今年各地区必须组织统一招生委员会
    （各地企业部门领导的学校须一律参加），按照国家培养干部计划来统一调配学生，以实现有计划地、有步骤地培养干部计划，为保证高等学校特别是高等和中等师范学校完成既定招生计划，招一定数量的初、高中毕业生，各中学除应事先经常对学生进行爱国主义思想教育外，并须同时加强对学生的升学思想指导，动员并组织部分学生投考师范学校，动员学生响应祖国号召，热烈踊跃地到国家最需要的岗位上去，要使学生认识，只有这样才是最光荣的，才是真正爱国的具体表现。在调配学生时，应与其他地区有关方面联系，以便招生工作得以顺利进行（详见本部拟定的招生计划）。
    二、关于各级学校修建设备，必须采取因陋就简，就原有学校增班为主、建新校为辅的办法。由于“三反”和“五反”运动，各地修建机构多被打乱，修建经费较少，时间又很急迫，各级学校修建设备，若不采取因陋就简、增班为主、建校为辅、充分利用现有设备校舍，如选择条件较好的小学增设初中班、技术班、师范班，初中增设高中班，初师增设中师班，城市实行二部制，乡村利用庙宇、公用房屋、土地改革时没收的房子解决校舍等办法，并从多方面着想，就很难及时解决校舍问题。
    三、为着完成今年培养干部计划，必须采用下列办法来解决师资问题：
    （一）大力推行就地取才逐级提升的办法来解决各级学校师资不足的困难，如提拔优秀的在职高小教师为初中教师，提拔初中教师为高中教师，初级师范学校教师提拔为师范学校教师等等。
    （二）各地在分配今年暑假高中及师范学校毕业生时，应按分配名额挑选优秀者留校充当见习教员或政治辅导员。
    （三）中学职员有相当于高中及专科程度者可酌予改任教员。
    （四）酌量增加教员授课时数，如某些课程可采用并班上大课的办法，并尽量减少教员课外负担，腾出时间教课。
    （五）招收失业知识分子施以短期训练后充任教员（全国总的计划另行通知）。
    总之，各级教育行政部门应根据国家建设需要，切实督饬所属学校运用革命的精神和办法，发扬创造精神，精打细算，用较少的钱，办较多的事，尽量发挥人力物力方面的利用率和潜在力。以实现国家培养干部的计划。
    为保证工作有组织地进行，必须建立严格的请示报告制度，各区应将工作进行情况及困难问题及时报告我部，以便协助解决。
