Comrades, glorious families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents nationwide:

    I am a glorious family member of a revolutionary martyr – Dong Cunrui’s father, Dong Quanzhong. The government takes such good care of me. This year, I received 120 workdays for substitute cultivation, and there are plans to build me a new house. Comrades from the People's Liberation Army often write to inquire about me or send people to visit me specifically. I believe you are all receiving the same care from the government as I am. Now that the "August 1st" Army Day is approaching, we should greet it with practical actions, first and foremost by encouraging our children and husbands to build up their health and defend our beloved motherland.

    Although my son Dong Cunrui sacrificed his life, I feel extremely honored. Because my son sacrificed himself for the liberation of the suffering Chinese people, it was most worthwhile. I am now not only the father of Cunrui alone but the father of thousands upon thousands of Cunruis. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the students of Cunrui Middle School in Rehe Province write to me, saying: "Dear Dad and Mom..." "Dear parents..." "Dear Grandpa..." These letters often move me to tears. This is my honor. This honor is given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!

    I have no other skills; I can only cultivate the land well, guarantee a good harvest, and support the Volunteer Army in killing more American devils to repay the People's Government for their care and concern for us. Only in this way can we be worthy of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    Although I am over fifty years old, my body and spirit are still very good. I guarantee to you that I cannot lag behind others in any work. As long as I can work for one day, I will try my best to work and never sit idly by waiting for the government to take care of me.

    This year, I have cultivated more than thirty mu of land, and the crops are growing very well. In addition to the workdays allocated by the village, I do all the work in the fields myself: plowing, sowing, hoeing, harrowing... I can do any kind of work. When it rains and I can't go to the fields, I make strips and weave baskets; when I have woven enough, I carry them to the city to sell. I also raised a few goats, and this year they have multiplied to thirty-five; last year I only had one donkey, but this year I practiced frugality, and I bought another donkey with the money I saved, and it also had a foal, so I now have three donkeys in total. Now my family has everything we need, and our lives are getting better and better every day. In addition, I have also sent Cunrui's younger brother Cun Sheng and younger sister Cun Mei to school; I have entrusted them to Chairman Mao.

    I lead a mutual aid team. This spring, when we were sowing during the drought, our team worked ahead and also explained the principles to others, so the villagers no longer relied on the heavens. Now, my team has increased from four households to six households. Under the influence and leadership of our team, fifteen more mutual aid teams have been organized in the whole village. Recently, the village suffered from pests, and men and women, young and old, worked together to pull up more than seven hundred jin of diseased seedlings infested with stem borers in one day, eliminating the pests.

    In the past, people in the village did not take studying seriously. After I returned from Beijing last year, I told the villagers about the hardship of not being able to read. I said: In Beijing, many people asked me to sign my name, which embarrassed me. Besides, I don't know how many letters people send me every year, and I am anxious because I can't read them, which is such a sad thing! From then on, the village began to value studying. Now, all eighty-two children in the village are attending school, and a class has even graduated this year and will be going to higher primary school.

    Dear glorious families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents nationwide: In the past, I worked hard in production and actively worked, and I will continue to do so in the future. I want to always maintain my dual glorious titles of heroic revolutionary martyr's family member and model military dependent. I hope you can all do the same, which is the only way to be worthy of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    董存瑞的父亲董全忠为纪念“八一”建军节
    给全国烈属军属的一封信
    光荣的全国烈属军属同志：
    我是一个光荣的烈属——董存瑞的父亲董全忠。政府对我照顾得太周到了。今年给我拨了一百二十工代耕，还打算给我盖新房。人民解放军的同志们常来信问候我，或专门派人来访问我。我想你们也和我一样受着政府的照顾。现在“八一”建军节来到了，咱们应该用实际行动来迎接它，首先就是鼓励自己的儿女和丈夫锻炼好身体，保卫咱们可爱的祖国。
    我的儿子董存瑞虽然牺牲了，但我感到非常光荣。因为我的儿子为了解放苦难的中国人民而牺牲，是最有价值的。我现在不只是存瑞一个人的父亲，而是千千万万存瑞的父亲了。人民解放军的战士们和热河省存瑞中学学生们给我来信都这样写：“亲爱的爸爸妈妈……”“亲爱的父母亲大人……”“亲爱的爷爷……”这些信时常把我感动得流出泪来。这是我的光荣。这光荣是毛主席和共产党给我的呀！
    我没有别的能耐，我只有种好地，保证丰收，支持志愿军多杀美国鬼子，来报答人民政府对我们的照顾和关心。这样才对得起毛主席和共产党。
    别看我是五十多岁的人了，我的身体和精神都还很好。我向你们提出保证，我样样工作都不能落在别人的后面。只要我能够劳动一天，我就尽量劳动，绝不坐着等政府照顾。
    我今年种了三十多亩地，庄稼长得很好。除了村里给拨的工外，地里的活都是我自己干，耕、耩、锄、耙……啥活我都能干。下雨天不能下地，我就打条子编筐，编得多了就驮到城里去卖。我还养了几只羊，今年已繁殖到三十五只了；去年我还只有一头驴，今年闹节约，我把省下来的钱又买了一头驴，又下了一个小驴驹，总共我已经有了三头驴了。现在我家里要啥有啥，日子过得一天比一天好起来了。另外我还叫存瑞的弟弟存生、妹妹存梅上了学，我把他们交给了毛主席。
    我领导了一个互助组。今年春天抗旱播种的时候，我们小组干在头里，又给别人讲道理，老乡们也就不再靠天了。现在，我的小组已经由四户增加到六户了。在我们小组的影响和带动下，全村又组织了十五个互助小组。最近村里闹害虫，男女老少一齐下手，一天就拔了七百多斤钻心虫病秧，把害虫消灭光了。
    过去村里人拿念书都不当会事看。我去年从北京回来以后，就给老乡们讲自己不识字的苦处。我说：在北京有好多人都叫我给签字，这可把我难住了。再说，一年还不知道有多少人给我来信，我心里干着急认不得，这是多么难过的事！从此以后，村里才把念书看重了。现在全村八十二个儿童都上学了，今年还有一班毕了业，要上高小。
    亲爱的光荣的全国烈属军属同志们：我过去是努力生产，积极工作，今后还要这样继续做下去。我要永远保持着我英雄烈属和模范军属的双重光荣称号。我希望你们也都能够这样做，这才对得起毛主席和共产党。
                董存瑞的父亲  董全忠
