    To the Editorial Board:
    I am a cadre from the Guogongying Village, Eighth District, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province. Last year during the Spring Festival, while I was training in the county, I learned the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battle Song." After returning, I organized an evening gathering and sent people to teach the masses to sing in various villages, which was very popular. In just two evenings, many people learned it. Music activities in the villages quickly became lively. Everywhere, one could hear the heroic singing of "March on bravely, raising our heads high," which greatly educated the masses. These musical activities have played a certain role in encouraging everyone to develop production plans and strive for a bumper harvest this year. Now is the time when the agricultural production increase campaign is vigorously developing. I hope that music workers across the country will create more songs suitable for farmers to sing that reflect rural mutual aid production. I also hope that various regions will launch activities to teach the masses to sing. This will further encourage the production enthusiasm of farmers and gradually lead them towards collectivization.

    希望创作适合农民唱的歌曲
    编辑同志：河北省清苑县第八区国公营村干部，去年春节在县里受训时学会了中国人民志愿军战歌，回来后就组织了晚会，并派人分头到各村教群众唱歌，很受群众欢迎。两天晚上的时间，许多人就学会了。各村的音乐活动，很快就活跃起来了。到处都能听到“雄赳赳，气昂昂”的雄壮歌声，群众得到了很大的教育。这种音乐活动，对鼓舞大家订出生产计划，争取今年丰收，起了一定的作用。现在正是农业增产竞赛运动蓬勃开展的时候，希望全国音乐工作者多创作适合农民唱的反映农村互助生产的歌曲；并希望各地展开教群众唱歌的活动。这样就更会鼓舞农民的生产热情，并使他们逐渐走向集体化。
