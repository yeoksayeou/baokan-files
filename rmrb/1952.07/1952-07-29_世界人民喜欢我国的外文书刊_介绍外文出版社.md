People Around the World Love Our Foreign Language Books and Periodicals
—An Introduction to Foreign Languages Press
	Luo Liang

	Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, at the end of 1949, Foreign Languages Press began publishing various books and periodicals in Russian, English, and other foreign languages to introduce the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people and the great achievements of the new China in various fields to foreign readers. Due to the profound impact of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the universal respect for Mao Zedong Thought, these books and periodicals have gained an increasing number of readers worldwide over the past two years. These books include authoritative works by the leaders of the Chinese people, important decrees and documents of the Central People's Government, vivid reports on the many significant victories of the Chinese people on the economic and cultural fronts, and their heroic struggles in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending peace. They inspire the vast freedom-loving people of the world with the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. They have also played a certain role in developing and consolidating the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. They have provided ironclad evidence in exposing the shameful crimes and failures of the American war instigators in China and Korea—including the crimes and failures of bacteriological warfare—thereby contributing its strength to the common cause of all mankind in striving for peace and opposing war.
	Foreign Languages Press publishes three periodicals: the English "People's China" bi-monthly, the Russian "People's China" monthly (which will be changed to a bi-monthly from August this year), and the Esperanto "China Reconstructs" monthly.
	The well-known English edition of "People's China," since its inception on New Year's Day in 1950, has gained tens of thousands of long-term readers in more than fifty countries. Over the past two years, the readers' letters received by the magazine consistently reflect that it is a highly cherished read. Articles published in "People's China" are frequently reprinted and cited by newspapers and periodicals in various countries. Several Indian readers have written to say that "People's China" is "the voice of the Asian people." According to a letter from India, a survey shows that in India, one copy of the English "People's China" is often read by thirty to forty readers in turn.
	The Russian "People's China," since its inception on November 1, 1950, has sold over 38,000 copies per issue through retail alone. If it is changed to a bi-monthly and accepts subscriptions in the future, it will be even more in short supply. The magazine is highly valued by a large number of readers in the Soviet Union. The newspaper Pravda published a special article commenting that "'People's China' portrays the life and struggle of the Chinese people, thereby further consolidating the indestructible and eternal friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and China." A friend who recently came from the Soviet Union said that he saw the Russian "People's China" on sale at every station, large and small, on the train journey from Moscow to Manchuria. Kiosks in Moscow are all selling this magazine. Some kiosks have sold out of the magazine but have kept an older copy as an advertising sample and refuse to sell it.
	Readers from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, from scientists to collective farmers, love China, care about China, and are eager to learn more about the life and construction achievements of the working people in the new China. Therefore, Soviet readers not only read it enthusiastically but also study it. Propagandists in various places also use its materials to carry out propaganda and agitation work about the new China.
	The direct readers of the Esperanto "China Reconstructs" monthly are Esperanto readers distributed in various countries. The articles in the magazine are often translated into various national languages and published in newspapers and periodicals in various countries, partially satisfying the desire of people in various countries to understand new China. In the Eastern European people's democratic countries, some Esperanto readers translate the magazine's reports into their own languages in factories and read them aloud to the workers. In capitalist countries, although many Esperanto readers have different political beliefs, they have also written to express their welcome to this magazine that reports on new China.
	In terms of books, Foreign Languages Press has published several important works and reports by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders, as well as reports on the achievements of the new China and small booklets on various important policies and laws, in Russian, English, French, German, Indonesian, and Esperanto, which have been distributed to eighty-two countries and regions. Among these books, the leaders' works and reports on the lives of the people of new China are the most popular. Chairman Mao's "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" alone has been reprinted four times in the English translation. In India, in addition to English, this book has been translated into seven different national languages. Myanmar and other places have also translated it into local languages based on the English translation and published it. In France, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party notified the entire party to study this authoritative work. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism," "On the Party," "On Inner-Party Struggle," "How to Be a Good Communist," and Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" in Russian, English, and French translations have been highly valued by progressive readers in various countries. A bookstore in the United Kingdom telegraphed several times in succession to order "On the Party." Several magazines have published reviews of this important work. The British bookstore also reprinted "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China." Important documents such as "Documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," "Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China," "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China," "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China," and reports on the achievements of the new China such as "The Victory of the Chinese People on the Financial and Economic Front," "China's Railways," "Culture and Education in New China," etc., have also been welcomed by readers. Many books and periodicals were sold out shortly after publication, some were reprinted once or twice, and some were reprinted by foreign bookstores or translated and published in their publications. A German publishing house reprinted the German versions of "The Chinese People's Liberation Army" and "Chinese Youth on the March," each reaching 200,000 copies. In addition, regarding the Chinese people's struggle for peace, Foreign Languages Press has also published "Seven Hundred Million People Want Peace and Democracy," "China Fights for Peace," and more than ten other pamphlets.
	Due to the enormous influence of the Chinese revolution and the deep-rooted nature of Mao Zedong Thought, whether in the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, the colonial and semi-colonial countries, or the capitalist countries, people are thirsting for publications from new China. A Soviet reader wrote: "'People's China' magazine allows me to understand the life and growth of the great Chinese people liberated from the enslavement of imperialists; it gives me a lot of help in my daily work. When I read the articles, while seeing the photos showing how the people of China and the Soviet Union are consolidating their unity, I feel that this is the guarantee of lasting world peace." For readers in colonial and semi-colonial countries, publications from new China inspire their confidence in fighting for peace and freedom. For example, a reader from West Africa wrote: "Because we live in a colonial and semi-feudal society, we are irresistibly attracted by the rich experience of the Chinese people's struggle and the genius of your leader Comrade Mao Zedong in applying Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, we also particularly favor your publications." Indian reader Krishna Gore said: "Articles reporting on the people of new China bring new hope to Asian society." A Japanese reader said: "Your publications will make me fight more actively than before to achieve our common ultimate goal: world peace and Japan's liberation from American occupation." A Finnish reader wrote, "'People's China' constantly increases our interest and concern for China and clears away the influence of the false propaganda in the newspapers subsidized by Wall Street. This magazine has the power of water dripping through stone, dispersing ignorance and ignorance." An Italian student wrote, "Mao Zedong's book moved me very much... I am convinced that his works will greatly help us."
	Looking back over the past two years and more, our young People's Republic's foreign language publishing work has played a certain role in promoting the understanding of new China by people of all countries and deepening the unity between our people and the people of all countries. However, from the perspective of the overall development of the world situation, this is only a beginning. What has already been published, whether in terms of language, type, quantity, or quality, is still far from meeting the needs of the objective situation. Recently, Foreign Languages Press decided to develop in the direction of professional division of labor in order to more concentratedly and effectively promote peace and the achievements of our country's social reform and production construction. Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the daily achievements of the people of the whole country require our state publishing house to continue to move steadily forward on the original basis with unremitting efforts.

    世界人民喜欢我国的外文书刊
    ——介绍外文出版社
    罗良
    中华人民共和国成立后不久，在一九四九年底，外文出版社即开始用俄文、英文及其他外文出版了各种书籍和刊物，以向外国读者介绍中国人民的革命斗争和新中国各方面的伟大成就。由于中国革命胜利的深刻影响，由于毛泽东思想所受到的普遍尊重，两年多来，这些书刊在全世界范围内已经有了日渐众多的读者。这些书刊中包括有中国人民领袖的一部分权威著作，有中央人民政府的重要法令、文件，有关于中国人民在经济和文化战线上许多重大胜利和抗美援朝、保卫和平方面英勇斗争的生动报告，它们以马克思——列宁主义在中国的胜利鼓舞着全世界爱好自由的广大人民。它们在发展与巩固中国与苏联和人民民主国家之间的友谊方面，也起了一定的作用。它们在暴露美国战争挑拨者在中国与朝鲜的可耻罪行和失败——包括细菌战争的罪行和失败方面，提供了铁的证据，从而在全人类争取和平反对战争的共同事业中尽了它的力量。
    外文出版社出版了三个期刊：英文“人民中国”半月刊、俄文“人民中国”月刊（本年八月起将改为半月刊）和世界语“人民中国报道”月刊。
    人们熟知的“人民中国”英文版自一九五○年元旦创刊以来，已在五十几个国家中有了成万的长期读者。在过去两年里，该刊所收到的读者来信一致反映，该刊是他们极喜爱的读物。“人民中国”所刊载的文章经常为各国报刊所转载和引用。有好几个印度读者都来信说：“人民中国”是“亚洲人民的呼声”。据一封印度来信说，据调查，在印度，一本英文“人民中国”常有三十至四十个读者辗转阅读。
    俄文“人民中国”自一九五○年十一月一日创刊，每期仅零售即达三万八千余册，如果将来改为半月刊，接受订户，就更会供不应求。该刊在苏联受到广大读者的重视。真理报曾以专文评论说，“‘人民中国’表现着中国人民的生活和斗争，从而促使苏中两个伟大的人民之间不可摧毁的永久友谊更进一步巩固起来。”最近从苏联来的一位朋友说：他在从莫斯科到满洲里的火车旅行中，看到每一大小车站都有俄文“人民中国”在出售。莫斯科市内的书亭都在销售这一杂志。有些书亭已将该刊卖完，但保留了较旧的一本不肯卖出，做为广告样本。
    苏联各界读者，从科学家到集体农民，都热爱中国，关心中国，极想多多了解新中国劳动人民的生活和建设的成就。因此苏联读者不仅热心地阅读它，而且进行研究。各地的宣传员还利用它的材料来进行关于新中国的宣传鼓动工作。
    世界语“人民中国报道”月刊的直接读者是分布在各国的世界语读者中的。该刊的文章经常被用各种民族文字译载于各国报刊上，部分地满足了各国人民对于了解新中国事物的渴求。在东欧人民民主国家中，有的世界语读者在工厂中用他们自己的语言翻译出该刊的报道文章，朗诵给工人听。在资本主义国家，尽管许多世界语读者有着不同的政治信仰，但也都纷纷来信表示欢迎这个报道新中国的杂志。
    在书籍方面，外文出版社用俄文、英文、法文、德文、印尼文及世界语等文字出版了毛主席、刘少奇副主席、周恩来总理及其他领袖的若干重要著作和报告，新中国成就的报道与各种重要政策法令小册子，共发行到八十二个国家和地区。在这些书籍当中，以领袖著作和新中国人民生活的报道最受欢迎。毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，仅英译本已再版了四次。在印度，这本书除英文外，已有七种不同的民族文字的译本。缅甸和其他地方也根据英译本翻译成当地文字出版。在法国，法国共产党中央曾通知全党学习这本权威的著作。刘少奇副主席的
    “论国际主义与民族主义”、“论党”、“论党内斗争”、“论共产党员的修养”，以及胡乔木同志所著的“中国共产党的三十年”的俄、英、法文译本，在各国的进步读者中受到极大的重视。“论党”一书，英国一个书店曾连续数次打电报来订购。几个杂志都刊登了关于这本重要著作的评论。英国书店并翻印了“中国共产党的三十年”。重要文件如“政协文献”、“中华人民共和国婚姻法”、
    “中华人民共和国土地改革法”、“中华人民共和国工会法”和新中国成就的报道如“中国人民在财政经济战线上的胜利”、“中国的铁路”、“新中国的文化教育”等等，也都受到读者欢迎，许多书刊都在出版后不久就销完，有的还再版了一次到两次，有的被外国书店翻印或译载在他们的刊物上。德国一个出版社翻印的德文本“中国人民解放军”与“中国青年在前进”两书，每种各达二十万册之多。此外，关于中国人民争取和平的斗争，外文出版社还出版了“七亿人民要和平民主”、“中国为和平而斗争”及其他十余种小册子。
    由于中国革命的巨大影响和毛泽东思想的深入人心，不论在苏联，在新民主主义国家，殖民地半殖民地国家或资本主义国家，人们都如饥似渴地要求新中国的出版物。一个苏联读者来信说：“‘人民中国’杂志使我了解从帝国主义者奴役下解放出来的伟大中国人民的生活和成长；它给予了我日常工作中的许多帮助。当我阅读文章时，一边看到表现中苏两国人民是怎样巩固团结的照片，我觉得这就是世界持久和平的保证。”对于殖民地半殖民地的读者，新中国的出版物鼓舞着他们为和平与自由而斗争的信心。例如一个西非洲的读者来信说：“因为我们是生活在殖民地和半封建的社会里，我们就不可抗拒地被中国人民斗争的丰富经验和你们的领袖毛泽东同志运用马克思——列宁主义于中国革命的具体情况的天才所吸引。因此我们也特别偏爱你们的出版物。”印度读者克里历那·哥说：“报道新中国人民的文章，为亚洲的社会带来了新的希望。”一个日本读者说：“你们的出版物将使我比以前更积极地斗争，以求达到我们共同的最终目的：世界和平与日本从美国的占领下获得解放。”芬兰一读者来信说，“‘人民中国’不断地增加了我们对中国的兴趣和关怀，并清除了华尔街津贴的报纸上的谎言宣传的影响。这杂志就像滴水穿石一样大的力量，将愚昧和无知都冲散了。”一个意大利学生来信说，“毛泽东的书使我十分感动……我确信他的著作将大大有助于我们。”
    回顾两年多以来，我们年轻的人民共和国的外文出版工作，在促进各国人民对新中国的认识和加深我国人民和各国人民的团结方面，是起了一定作用的，但是，从整个世界发展的局势说来，这还只是
    一个开端。已经出版的东西，无论在文字、种类以及数量和质量上都还远远赶不上客观形势的需要。最近外文出版社决定向专业分工的方向发展，以便更集中而有效地宣传和平，宣传我国的社会改革和生产建设的成就。在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，全国人民的日新月异的成就要求着我们这个国家出版社以不懈的努力在原有的基础上继续稳步前进。
