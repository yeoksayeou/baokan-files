Lecture 2: Physiological changes during pregnancy create favorable conditions for childbirth

The process of male and female germ cells uniting to form a new individual is called pregnancy or gestation. Pregnancy is the state of a woman carrying a fertilized egg in her uterus. Generally, it is counted from the first day of the last menstrual period, and two hundred and eighty days is considered a normal pregnancy duration. Four weeks, or twenty-eight days, is counted as one month of pregnancy, and the pregnancy period is a total of ten months.

After sexual intercourse, many sperm (approximately two billion in one ejaculation) are deposited in the posterior fornix of the vagina. Due to the automatic movement of their tails, they swim upstream along the cervical canal, through the uterine cavity, and into the fallopian tube, reaching the ampulla of the fallopian tube. At the same time, the eggs captured into the fallopian tube by the automatic movement of the ovaries also reach the ampulla of the fallopian tube. Thus, fertilization occurs here. The egg that unites with the sperm is called a fertilized egg. Sperm move at a speed of about two to three millimeters per minute. It takes about seventy minutes for sperm to travel from the external cervical os to the ampulla of the fallopian tube (about seventy millimeters).

After fertilization, a new life begins to develop. On the one hand, pregnancy gradually develops, and at the same time, the fertilized egg begins to be transported. The transport of the fertilized egg is carried out by the automatic movement of the fallopian tube. The ampulla of the fallopian tube, which was originally stationary, begins to contract slowly at the same time as fertilization, rotating the fertilized egg to eliminate the unevenness on its surface. Next, the fallopian tube contracts more strongly, pressing the fertilized egg back into the narrow isthmus of the fallopian tube. The circular muscles of the isthmus of the fallopian tube also gradually contract, like the peristalsis of the intestines, transporting the fertilized egg to the interstitial part of the tube. The above transport time takes about twenty-four hours each in the ampulla, isthmus, and interstitial part. Therefore, it takes three days for the fertilized egg to reach the uterine cavity after fertilization. The phenomenon of the fertilized egg entering and settling in the endometrium is called "implantation of the fertilized egg." This phenomenon is also entirely accomplished by the automatic movement of the fertilized egg. When the fertilized egg reaches the surface of the uterine mucosa (thick, soft, and viscous) that is prepared to receive it, the fertilized egg secretes enzymes from the cell surface, dissolving a small local area of the endometrium. After a certain local area of the uterus is dissolved, the fertilized egg enters and sinks below the mucosa. Such changes in implantation generally take six to seven days.

The fetus lives in the uterus for ten months (calculated according to the pregnancy calendar), constantly developing and preparing for life outside the uterus after childbirth. The fertilized egg initially develops in a simple cell division manner, following certain rules and a certain progress, just like a single-celled animal. By the second month of pregnancy, a human form can be seen. By the end of the fourth month, male and female sexes can be distinguished. By the eighth month, the fetus initially has the conditions to live independently outside the uterus.

At the end of the tenth month of pregnancy, the fetus has the conditions for complete independent life and is called a mature fetus. Simultaneously with fetal development, fetal appendages (placenta, amniotic membrane, etc.) also develop according to certain rules. The placenta is fully developed in the fourth month of pregnancy. The fetus receives oxygen, sugar, protein, fat, salts, water, etc. from the mother through the placental blood circulation, and can also receive antibodies and drugs to resist diseases. At the same time, fetal excrement is also excreted into the mother's blood through the placenta.

Amniotic fluid fills the uterine cavity, maintaining appropriate tension in the uterus. This not only protects the fetus, but also allows the fetus to maintain a suitable fetal position, lie, and free movement, and can avoid adhesions and compression of the fetus in the uterus. During childbirth, the amniotic fluid evenly distributes the pressure inside the uterus, preventing placental abruption and direct pressure on the fetus from uterine muscle contractions. Secondly, the amniotic fluid can form the bag of waters during childbirth in the lower part of the uterus. This very soft and yet powerful bag of waters gradually expands the cervix, so that the fetus can continue to pass through the birth canal.

After pregnancy is established, many physiological changes also occur in the mother's body, creating favorable conditions for nurturing the fetus and childbirth.

The most significant change is in the uterus. The body of the uterus is dilated and expanded by the fetus, and can be more than five hundred times larger than the original uterus, without the pregnant woman feeling pain. This shows that the sensation of the uterus is very dull. The expansion of the body of the uterus causes the abdomen to bulge in appearance. The number of months of pregnancy can be determined from the size of the uterine bulge.

The enlarged uterus becomes increasingly sensitive to contractions. From the fifth week of pregnancy, the contractility of the uterine body muscles increases, and the closer to the end of pregnancy, the stronger the contractility. This change in contractility is undoubtedly of great benefit to future childbirth.

The cervix becomes very soft, and the elasticity is significantly increased. From the fifth month of pregnancy, the cervical os begins to dilate, and by the end of pregnancy, eight fingers can pass through it freely. This shows that the changes in the cervix and cervical os provide favorable conditions for childbirth.

The isthmus of the uterus begins to stretch to two to three times its size from the third month of pregnancy, and extends to seven to ten centimeters by the end of pregnancy, which also prepares for childbirth.

After pregnancy, the ovary develops a "corpus luteum of pregnancy," which is formed by the un-degenerated corpus luteum formed after the egg is fertilized. The hormones produced by the "corpus luteum of pregnancy" have a pregnancy-stabilizing effect. The so-called pregnancy-stabilizing effect is to reduce the contractility and sensitivity of the uterus to ensure the smooth development of the fetus. Miscarriage is prone to occur in the first three months of pregnancy, but due to this hormone, miscarriage is less likely to occur. The "corpus luteum of pregnancy" continues to develop until the third month of pregnancy, and stops developing after three months, remaining in its original state until the sixth month of pregnancy. From the sixth month onwards, it gradually degenerates. After it degenerates, the contractility of the uterine muscles increases. This again prepares favorable conditions for childbirth.

The vulva becomes moist and soft after pregnancy, and the elasticity is significantly increased. The vagina becomes significantly softer and larger, which can also be considered a preparation for childbirth. Secondly, the acidity of the vagina increases, so pathogens and miscellaneous bacteria cannot reproduce in the vagina.

The ligaments between the bones of the pelvis become soft and relaxed, and the width of the pelvis increases due to new bone formation. This change is of course beneficial to childbirth.

Pigmentation on the skin is obvious, there are pregnancy lines on the abdomen and breasts, and pregnancy freckles on the face. We do not yet understand the benefits of these changes. In terms of blood, the total blood volume and plasma volume increase, the number of white blood cells increases, and the bactericidal power of the blood increases with the growth of pregnancy, reaching its peak during childbirth.

In terms of secretion, the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands all enlarge, especially the hypertrophy of the anterior pituitary gland, which can increase its volume by two to three times. The "gonadotropin" secreted by this gland is of great importance to pregnancy-related changes, but some people say that after three months of pregnancy, its role is replaced by "placental gonadotropin."

The changes in the breasts are obvious. Around the second month of pregnancy, the mammary glands begin to proliferate, the interstitium hypertrophies, and fat is significantly deposited, causing changes in the shape, size, and hardness of the breasts. The mammary glands gradually become active and begin to secrete colostrum. The areola and surrounding areas show increased pigmentation, showing pregnancy lines.

During pregnancy, stimuli from the developing follicles stimulate the nerve receptors inside the uterus, increasing the reactivity of the receptors. Secondly, the gradual increase in intrauterine pressure also increases the excitability of uterine reflexes. At the time of delivery, the uterus exhibits periodic contractions. During this period, the excitability of the cerebral cortex is often found to be low. Therefore, the brain cannot normally control the reflex excitability of the spinal cord. The reflexivity of the spinal cord increases, making the contraction excitability of the uterus more intense.

    无痛分娩法讲话

    第二讲  妊娠时期的生理变化创造了分娩的有利条件
    男女性细胞合一，形成一新个体的过程，称为怀孕或妊娠。妊娠就是妇女将受精卵孕育在自己子宫内的状态。一般是从最末次月经第一天算起，二百八十天算作正常妊娠持续日。四周即二十八天算做妊娠历的一个月，妊娠时期共十个月。
    性交后，射于阴道后穹窿部的很多精子（一次射精约二亿），由于它们尾部的自动运动，沿子宫颈管溯流而上，通过子宫腔进入卵管，达到卵管膨大部。同时由卵巢剪彩的自动运动捕捉入卵管内的卵子，亦达到卵管膨大部。于是，在此处发生受精现象。与精子会成一体的卵子叫做妊卵。精子每分钟运动速度约为二—三粍。精子自外子宫口游动到卵管膨大部（约七十粍）约须七十分钟。
    受精现象发生后，新生命即开始发展。一方面妊娠逐渐发展，同时开始输送妊卵。输送妊卵是由卵管的自动运动来执行。本来是静止的卵管膨大部，在受精的同时，开始缓慢地收缩，使妊卵回转，将妊卵表面上的凸凹不平取消。其次，卵管更强烈收缩，把妊卵压回到管腔很细的卵管峡部。卵管峡部的轮状筋也渐渐收缩，如同肠管的蠕动一样，将妊卵输送到管间质部。以上输送时间，在膨大部、峡部、间质部各约需二十四小时。所以妊卵在受精后三天才能到达子宫腔。妊卵进入并定着在子宫内膜的现象，称为“妊卵的着床”。这个现象也完全是由妊卵的自动运动而完成的。妊卵在达到为迎接妊卵而准备好条件的子宫粘膜面（肥厚柔软，而又粘稠）时，妊卵自细胞表面分泌出酵素，将子宫内膜的一个小的局部融解，子宫某一局部被融解后，妊卵即进入并沉到粘膜下。由这样的变化着床，一般约需六——七天的工夫。
    胎儿在子宫内生活十个月（按妊娠历计算），不断发育，准备着分娩后在子宫外生活的条件。妊卵最初和单细胞动物一样，是由单纯的细胞分裂方式，按着一定规律和一定进度发育的。到妊娠第二个月即可显示出人型。第四个月末可分别出男女性别。第八个月胎儿初步具备了在子宫外独立生活的条件。
    妊娠第十个月末，胎儿具备了完全独立生活的条件，称为成熟胎儿。与胎儿发育同时，胎儿附属物
    （胎盘、羊膜等）也按一定规则发育，胎盘是在妊娠第四个月发育完成。胎儿通过胎盘的血液循环从母体方面接受了氧气、糖、蛋白质、脂肪、盐类、水分等以外，并可接受抵抗疾病的抗体和药物。同时胎儿的排泄物也由胎盘排泄到母血中去。
    羊水充满子宫腔，使子宫保持适当的紧张度。这不仅可以保护胎儿，同时由于它的存在，才可能使胎儿保持合适的胎位、胎势和自由的运动，更可避免胎儿在子宫内起粘连和压迫的现象。在分娩时，羊水将子宫内压均等地传播，可以防止胎盘的剥离，又可防止胎儿受子宫肌收缩的直接压迫。其次羊水可在子宫的下部形成分娩时的卵胞，由这样很柔软而又有一定力量的卵胞，把子宫颈逐渐扩大开，以便胎儿继续通过产道。
    妊娠成立后，母体方面也发生很多生理变化，给孕育胎儿和分娩创造有利的条件。
    变化最显著的是子宫。子宫体被胎儿扩张膨隆，可以比原来的子宫大五百多倍，而妊妇并没有疼痛的感觉。这说明子宫的知觉是很迟钝的，子宫体的膨隆，引起了腹部外观的膨隆。从子宫膨隆的大小程度可以断定妊娠月数。
    已经增大了的子宫，收缩性变得越来越锐敏，子宫体肌从妊娠第五周开始，收缩性就亢进，越接近妊娠末期，收缩性就越增强。这种收缩性的变化，无疑是对将来分娩有很大好处。
    子宫颈变得非常软化，弹力性增强，从妊娠第五个月开始，子宫口即开大，到妊娠末期，可自由地通过八个手指。这说明了子宫颈和子宫口的变化，给分娩提供了有利的条件。
    子宫峡自妊娠第三个月开始伸展至二至三倍，到妊娠末期延长到七——十公分，这也给分娩作了准备工作。
    卵巢在妊娠后，即发生了“妊娠黄体”，这是由排出的卵子在受精后形成的黄体未退化而遗留下来的。由“妊娠黄体”产生出来的荷尔蒙有稳胎作用。所谓稳胎作用，就是使子宫的收缩性及敏感性减低，以保证胎儿的顺利发育。妊娠后三个月容易流产，但由于这种荷尔蒙的关系，流产就不易发生了。“妊娠黄体”继续发育到妊娠第三个月，三个月以后停止发育，保持原状到妊娠第六个月，自第六个月以后，则渐渐退化。它退化后，子宫肌的收缩性就亢进了。这又是给分娩准备了有利的条件。
    外阴部当怀孕后变得湿润柔软，弹力性显著增加。阴道显著地变软和扩大，这也可以认为是分娩的准备工作。其次阴道的酸度增高，因此在阴道内病原菌和杂菌都不能繁殖。
    骨盘的骨间由关节韧带变得柔软而缓解，又由于骨的新生，骨盘的宽大度增加。这种变化当然是有利于分娩的变化。
    皮肤上色素沉着显明，腹部及乳房部有妊娠腺，脸上有妊娠雀斑。这些变化的好处，我们现在尚不了解。血液方面，血液全量及血浆量增加，白血球数增加，血液的杀菌力随着妊娠的增长而加强，分娩时达到最高峰。
    在分泌方面，甲状腺、副甲状腺、副肾等皆增大，其中尤以脑下垂体前叶的肥大变化最显明，其容积可增大二——三倍。由此分泌的“性腺刺激素”对妊娠性变化是有重大关系的，但也有人说自妊娠三个月以后，则由“胎盘性性腺刺激素”代替它的作用。
    乳房的变化很显明。在妊娠第二个月左右，乳腺开始增殖，间质肥大，脂肪显著的沉着，使得乳房的形状、大小、硬度都起了变化；乳腺逐渐活跃起来，并开始分泌初乳；乳晕及其附近部分色素增加，呈现出妊娠腺。
    妊娠期间，来自发育卵胞的刺激，刺激子宫内部的神经感受器，以提高感受器的反应性。其次，子宫内压的刺激逐渐增加，也使得子宫反射的兴奋性升高。到分娩时，子宫出现周期性收缩。在此期间，往往发现大脑皮质的兴奋性低下，因此，大脑不能正常地控制脊髓的反射兴奋性，脊髓的反射性即升高，使得子宫的收缩兴奋性更形剧烈。
