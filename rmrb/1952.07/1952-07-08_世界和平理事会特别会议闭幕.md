Xinhua News Agency, July 7th dispatch from Berlin: The special session of the World Peace Council, after being held here for six days, victoriously concluded on the 6th. The session adopted a letter to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and to the people of the world regarding the German question; a resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Japanese problem; a resolution on the immediate cessation of the Korean War; and a declaration on convening the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5th of this year. The session also adopted the "Appeal to Men and Women Worldwide Against Bacteriological Warfare" passed by the Standing Committee at its Oslo meeting in April of this year. In addition, the session adopted the list of new council members proposed by the Standing Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th dispatch from Berlin: The special session of the World Peace Council continued its meetings on the 5th and 6th, discussing the third item on the agenda, "The Issue of the Arms Race and the Struggle to Demand the Signing of Peace Pacts."

    The morning session on the 5th was chaired by Madame Gordon of France. The Thai representative, ? Base Pasasuntorn, spoke first, discussing the situation in which the United States had turned Thailand into its military base in Southeast Asia. He said: Thailand's participation in the American gang, conspiring to realize America's war plans, has severely affected the people. The heavy burden of all military expenditures is weighing on the people, and there is police terror everywhere, and human rights are trampled upon. However, the Thai people, regardless of all this, have strongly expressed their will for peace and participated in the powerful international peace movement.

    The Indian representative, Klibalani, emphasized that the people of Asia are particularly concerned about defending peace because war is already a reality for them: in Malaya, Vietnam, and Korea, war has long been going on.

    The Brazilian representative, Fiyaro, spoke, saying: The Brazilian people will never agree to be allies of German militarists who are preparing a new war of aggression. The Brazilian people place great hope in the special session of the World Peace Council. They believe that this session will adopt practical and feasible resolutions that can ease international tensions. Fiyaro assured the meeting that the people of the Latin American countries, known for their heroism and love of freedom, can jointly safeguard the cause of peace with the people of all countries.

    Representatives from France, Iceland, Britain, Italy, Spain, Ceylon, Finland, Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela, and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

    The afternoon session on the 5th was chaired by Madame Streit of Australia. The first speaker was the Polish representative, Iwaskiewicz, who spoke about the struggle of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Tunisia for freedom and national independence and expressed his deep respect for their noble struggle.

    The Italian representative, the famous painter Guttuso, spoke, reminding the attendees in particular that the governments of some capitalist countries are trying their best to prevent the people of countries with different political systems from establishing contact and exchanging opinions. Just recently, the Italian intellectual community, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Da Vinci, invited scientists, artists, and writers from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, and Hungary to Italy, but these representatives were refused entry visas by the Italian authorities. In addition, Madame Gordon and Mr. Blier wanted to go to the United States but could not enter, Professor Bernal wanted to go to France but was also refused by the authorities, and Joliot-Curie wanted to go to Britain but was also refused entry. These things show that those who dream of launching a war are enemies of culture. Guttuso called on peace advocates to tear down the iron walls erected by war-mongers between cultural representatives of various countries.

    The Chilean peace fighter, the famous poet Neruda, spoke about the struggle to continue to develop and consolidate international cultural ties. He pointed out that the measures taken by the World Peace Council for this purpose have produced good effects, so the reactionaries are trying to split the unity of the people and obstruct the World Peace Council's efforts in this regard. He then talked about the miserable situation of some American cultural figures who refused to agree with Truman and refused to transplant "Western culture" to Korea in the manner of General Ridgway. He said that now this policy of the United States has been extended to the entire American continent. Brazil has begun to persecute Amado, and the famous Cuban essayist Marinello, who attended this meeting, is likely to be imprisoned when he returns home. However, Latin America is a rather unstable rear area for the aggressors. The governments of Latin American countries and the suffering but unyielding people of these countries are two different things and should not be confused. We must resist the covenants that governments sign to brew war, destruction, and bloodshed, and put forward our own covenants of truth and true culture.

    The American pastor Telford said: Religious workers in the United States have begun to realize more and more clearly that only the united struggle of peace-loving people from all over the world can bring brotherhood and peace to the world. Speaking of the arms race, Telford pointed out that the burden of the arms race is increasingly affecting the living standards of the American people. Although the American people know only a little about the truth of the Korean incident, the horrors of the Korean War have made their consciences more and more uneasy.

    Representatives from Australia and Mexico also expressed their opinions at the meeting.

    The afternoon session on the 6th was chaired by the Italian representative Finnorta. The speakers at the meeting were the Belgian representative Cavennier and the French peasant representative Meyer. Cavennier emphasized the need to develop normal economic and trade relations between countries. Meyer spoke about the struggle of French farmers to defend peace. They are preparing to hold a farmers' peace conference.

    The general discussion of the meeting came to an end. Chairman Finnorta announced that the meeting had received more than 1,500 congratulatory telegrams and letters from Germany and around the world. These included a letter from a group of Egyptian peace fighters who are being persecuted by the reactionaries and are now being tortured in a concentration camp in the desert.

    On Finnorta's proposal, the meeting unanimously decided to send a telegram in the name of all attendees to pay tribute to the imprisoned Egyptian brothers.

    The afternoon meeting was then adjourned.

    世界和平理事会特别会议闭幕
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议在此间举行了六天的会议后，已于六日胜利闭幕。会议通过了关于德国问题告美、英、法、苏四大国政府和全世界人民书；关于和平解决日本问题的决议；关于立即停止朝鲜战争的决议；关于在今年十二月五日在维也纳召开世界人民和平大会的宣言。会议并通过了常务委员会今年四月奥斯陆会议通过的“反对细菌战”的告全世界男女书。此外，会议还通过了常务委员会所提出的新理事的名单。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会特别会议在五日和六日继续开会，讨论第三项议程“扩张军备运动问题以及要求签订和平公约的斗争”。
    五日上午会议由法国戈登夫人担任主席。泰国代表?巴色·飒顺吞首先发言，他谈到了美国使泰国变成它在东南亚的军事基地的情况。他说：泰国参加美国一伙，共谋实现美国的战争计划，已使人民受到严重影响。一切军事开支的重担都压在人民肩上，到处是警察恐怖，人权受到蹂躏。但是，泰国人民却不顾这一切，强烈地表现了他们对和平的意志，并参加了强大的国际和平运动。
    印度代表克利伯兰尼强调指出：亚洲人民特别关怀保卫和平，因为战争在他们看来已经是一个现实：在马来亚、越南和朝鲜，战争老早就开始在进行着了。
    巴西代表费雅洛发言说：巴西人民永远不会同意做正在准备新侵略战争的德国军国主义者的盟友。巴西人民对于世界和平理事会特别会议寄以很大的希望。他们相信这次会议将通过可以缓和国际紧张形势的切实可行的决议。费雅洛在会上保证说：素以英勇和热爱自由闻名的拉丁美洲国家的人民，能够和一切国家的人民共同保障和平事业。
    在会上发言的尚有：法国、冰岛、英国、意大利、西班牙、锡兰、芬兰、古巴、阿根廷、委内瑞拉等国代表。
    五日下午会议由澳大利亚斯崔特夫人任主席。首先发言的波兰代表伊瓦茨凯维支谈到了朝鲜、越南、马来亚和突尼斯人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争，并对他们的崇高的斗争表示深切的敬意。
    意大利代表、名画家古图卓发言，他特别提醒到会者注意，若干资本主义国家的政府极力设法防止政治制度不同的各国人民建立联系、交换意见。就在不久以前，意大利知识界为纪念达·芬奇五百周年诞辰，曾邀请苏联、中国、波兰和匈牙利的科学家、艺术家和作家到意大利去，可是这些代表都被意大利当局拒绝发给入境签证。此外，戈登夫人和布利埃要想到美国去却不能入境，贝尔纳教授要想到法国去也被当局拒绝，约里奥—居里想到英国去也被拒绝入境。这些事情说明了，那些梦想发动战争的人都是文化的敌人。古图卓号召和平拥护者推倒战争贩子们在各国文化代表间竖立起来的铁墙。
    智利和平战士、名诗人聂鲁达发言，谈到继续发展和巩固国际文化联系的斗争。他指出：世界和平理事会为了这目的而采取的措施，已产生了良好的影响，因此反动派便企图分裂人民的团结，阻挠世界和平理事会这方面的努力。他接着谈到了某些美国文化人士因为拒绝和杜鲁门通同一气，拒绝以李奇微将军的办法把“西方文化”移植到朝鲜去，而处于怎样悲惨的境地。他说：现在美国这种政策已经扩大到了整个美洲大陆。巴西已开始迫害亚马多，出席这次会议的古巴名散文家马里奈洛回国很可能被监禁。但是，拉丁美洲是侵略者的相当不稳定的后方。拉丁美洲各国的政府和这些国家受苦受难然而决不屈服的人民，是两件事情，决不可混为一谈。各国政府签订酝酿战争、破坏和流血的公约，我们要抵制它们，提出我们自己真理和真正文化的公约。
    美国牧师特尔佛说：美国的宗教工作者已开始一天天清楚地认识到，唯有全世界各国爱好和平的人民团结一致进行斗争，才能使世界实现兄弟友爱与和平。特尔佛在谈到扩张军备运动时指出：扩张军备的重担愈来愈严重地影响美国人民的生活水平。美国人民虽然对于朝鲜事件的真相只晓得一点点，但是朝鲜战争的恐怖已经使他们的良心愈来愈感到不安了。
    澳大利亚和墨西哥的代表也在会上发表了意见。
    六日下午会议由意大利代表芬诺尔塔担任主席。会上发言的有比利时代表卡文尼尔和法国农民代表梅耶。卡文尼尔强调发展各国间正常的经济和贸易关系的必要性。梅耶谈到了法国农民的保卫和平的斗争。他们正在筹备举行一次农民和平会议。
    会议的一般讨论至此告一结束。主席芬诺尔塔宣布会议接到了来自德国和世界各地的一千五百多件贺电和贺信。其中包括埃及一群和平战士的贺信，这些人受到反动派的迫害，现在正在荒漠中的一个集中营里受折磨。
    会议根据芬诺尔塔的提议，一致决定以全体到会者的名义打电报向被囚禁的埃及兄弟们致敬。
    下午会议至此宣布闭会。
