All parts of East China have largely overcome the drought. Currently, in addition to continuing to pay attention to drought resistance and prevention, the entire region is vigorously focusing on flood prevention, preventing mountain floods, and preventing waterlogging. In the first half of July, rainfall was very even throughout East China, from north to south. The Wuhu and Anqing special districts in southern and northern Anhui, which were most severely affected by drought in June, received rain in early July, and the fields that needed to be sown have been planted. Due to recent heavy rains in various places, the Yi River and Shu River in Shandong and northern Jiangsu, the Huai River in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, as well as the Yangtze River downstream and the rivers in Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui, have entered a tense period of flood prevention. In some areas of Jiaozhou and Huimin special districts in Shandong Province, excessive rainfall recently caused waterlogging in farmland, and due to negligence in flood prevention, approximately 60,000 mu of farmland have been flooded. To strengthen flood prevention and waterlogging prevention work, the Linqi, Changwei, and Dezhou special districts of Shandong Province, the southern Jiangsu region, and many other regions' flood prevention and drought resistance agencies have dispatched inspection teams to inspect flood control work on major rivers and polder areas. The areas along the Yangtze River in southern and northern Anhui are inspecting dikes. In the Wuhu special district alone, hundreds of thousands of farmers are participating in flood prevention teams, inspecting dikes, and rushing to repair dangerous projects, while also addressing drought resistance. The Linqi special district of Shandong has mobilized people along the Yi River and Shu River to inspect the dikes of the two rivers in sections. After the completion of the second year of Huai River harnessing earthwork, the Huai River Harnessing Committee mobilized people along the river to repair approximately 500 kilometers of dikes in the Fuyang, Suxian, and Lu'an special districts in the middle reaches of the Huai River. Flood prevention and drought resistance personnel in areas along the Yangtze River, the coast, and the Yi River and Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu have recently been working on the dikes.

Currently, it is the time when rice in East China is heading and growing vigorously. As long as we overcome the floods, we will be confident of a good harvest this year in another month. Farmers in East China are working hard to strive for the final success of this year's patriotic production increase campaign. (Xinhua News Agency)

The water levels of various rivers in Hubei and Hunan provinces have risen, and various places have entered a tense stage of flood prevention. Since July 1st, the water levels of the Han River and the Yangtze River have begun to rise. At 7:00 AM on the 4th, the water level of the Shayang section of the Han River rose to 39.42 meters. On the same day, the water level of the Yangtze River near Shashi rose to 40.35 meters. All rivers have reached flood prevention water levels.

Currently, the various rivers in the Central South region have entered a tense flood season, and local governments are actively leading the people in flood prevention. Hu Yizhi, the deputy commissioner of the Jingzhou Special Commissioner's Office, as well as the county magistrates of various counties, the responsible cadres of the CCP at all levels, and the district chiefs and township chiefs of the areas along the Han River, went to the dikes successively on July 3rd and 4th to lead the people along the river to patrol the dikes and keep watch. More than 100,000 workers have recently gone to the Han River and Yangtze River's critical dike sections to carry out rush repairs on unfinished dike inspection and processing projects. Several dangerous situations have occurred in the dike sections of Songzi, Hongshan, and other counties, but they have been turned from danger to safety through round-the-clock rescue efforts in various places. The sentry sheds, flood prevention equipment, and flood prevention transportation equipment on individual dike sections have also been repaired or replenished. On July 10th, the water level of the Hudu River in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River rose to 40.92 meters (the highest historical water level of Taipingkou in the river is 44.52 meters). The Jingzhou Special Commissioner's Office and the Jingzhou Local Committee of the CCP decided to establish the Hudu River Flood Prevention Headquarters, and Yan Jun, the commissioner of the Jingzhou Special Commissioner's Office, personally went to areas with more serious water conditions to guide flood prevention work.

On July 10th, heavy rain fell in the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers and the Dongting Lake basin in Hunan Province. The rainfall in Dayong County along the Li River reached 154.3 millimeters, exceeding the largest rainfall in previous years. Currently, the water levels of the main streams and tributaries of the Li River and Yuan River are rising rapidly. In the Yuanling area, the water level rose sharply by 6.38 meters in 24 hours from 9:00 AM on the 10th to 9:00 AM on the 11th, only 4.14 meters lower than the highest water level in previous years. For this reason, the Hunan Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters called on the masses along the major rivers in the province to quickly make all preparations for flood prevention. The Yuan and Li rivers are immediately entering the flood prevention battle. (Xinhua News Agency)

With rising water levels in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Ningxia Province has strengthened flood prevention work along the Yellow River. Flood prevention organizations have been established in flood control zones on both banks. In Ningshuo County, the central area of diverting the Yellow River into canals in the province, technical teams composed of 12 to 25 people have been established at the water inlets of each main canal to be specifically responsible for the opening and closing of sluice gates and the management and application of water volume. In order to provide flood forecasts to the irrigation areas at any time, in addition to the Qingtongxia Hydrological Station constantly strengthening contact with hydrological stations upstream and downstream of the Yellow River, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau has also specially established a hydrological station at the Tanglai Canal entrance. The people in the areas along the canals in the irrigation area have all been organized and formed into maintenance canal and water management groups. According to incomplete statistics from Helan, Pingluo, Ningshuo, and Huinong counties, 998 maintenance groups have been established, with more than 20,000 people participating. These groups have all formulated maintenance covenants and irrigation systems, and have prepared tools and materials for disaster relief. In order to further strengthen the regular work of maintenance organizations in various places, the Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau sent a supervisory team to various places at the end of June to conduct key inspections.

    华东全区和湖北湖南宁夏等省加紧防汛
    华东各地旱象已经大体解除了。现在，全区除继续注意抗旱防旱外，正大力注意防汛、防止山洪暴发和防涝等工作。七月上半月，华东全区从北到南雨量都很均匀。六月最旱的皖南芜湖专区和皖北安庆专区，七月上旬都下了雨，应播种的田地都已抢种上了。由于最近各地连降大雨，现在，山东、苏北的沂河、沭河，皖北、苏北的淮河，以及长江下游和浙江、苏南、皖南境内的各河，都已进入防汛的紧张时期。山东省胶州、惠民两专区的部分地区，最近就因雨量过大，农田受涝，而且因为疏于防汛，已有约六万亩农田被淹。为加强防汛、防涝工作，山东省的临沂、昌潍、德州等专区和苏南地区，以及其他许多地区的防汛抗旱机构，都已分别派出检查组，到各主要河流和圩区检查防洪工作。皖南皖北沿长江一带都在检查堤防，芜湖专区就有十几万农民，参加了防汛队伍，检查堤防，抢修险工，同时兼顾抗旱。山东临沂专区已发动沂河、沭河沿岸人民分段检查两河堤防。治淮委员会在第二年度的治淮土工结束后，又发动沿河人民加修了淮河中游阜阳、宿县、六安等专区约五百多公里长的堤防。苏北沿江、沿海和沂河、运河沿岸地区的防汛抗旱工作人员，最近都已上堤办公。
    目前，正是华东各地稻禾抽穗、旺盛成长的时候，只要战胜洪水，再过一月，今年的丰收就有把握了。华东农民，正在为争取今年爱国增产竞赛的最后成功而努力。    （新华社）
    湖北、湖南两省各江河水位上涨，各地已进入防汛的紧张阶段。自七月一日起，汉江、长江水位即开始上涨。四日上午七时，汉江沙洋段水位涨到三九·四二公尺，同日沙市一带长江水位涨到四○·三五公尺。各河流均已达到防汛水位。
    目前，中南区各江、河已进入紧张汛期，各地人民政府正积极领导人民防汛。荆州专署副专员胡易之和各县县长、中共各级组织的负责干部及沿汉江各区区长、乡长都在七月三、四日先后上堤，领导沿河民工巡堤放哨。汉江、长江各险要堤段，最近又有十万多民工上堤突击进行过去尚未完成的查堤加工工程。松滋、洪山等县堤段曾发生几处险象，经各地日夜抢救，现已转危为安。个别堤段的哨棚、防汛器材、防汛交通等设备，也作了修补或补充。七月十日，长江中游虎渡河水位上涨到四○·九二公尺（该河太平口历来最高水位为四四点五二公尺）。荆州专署和中共荆州地方委员会决议成立虎渡河防汛指挥部，荆州专署专员阎钧亲往水情较严重地区指导防汛工作。
    七月十日湖南省湘、资、沅、澧四水和洞庭湖流域都降暴雨，沿澧水的大庸县雨量达一五四·三公厘，超过了历年最大的雨量。现在，澧水和沅水干支流水位上涨都很快，沅陵地区在十日上午九时至十一日上午九时止的二十四小时内，水位陡涨六·三八公尺，比历年最高水位仅差四·一四公尺。为此，湖南省防汛指挥部号召全省各大河沿岸群众迅速做好一切防汛准备工作，沅、澧二水各地立即投入防汛战斗。（新华社）
    黄河上游涨水，宁夏省黄河沿岸已加强防汛工作。两岸防洪地带，都已设立了防洪组织。该省引黄入渠的中心地区宁朔县各干渠的进水闸也都设立了由十二人到二十五人组织成的技术班，专门负责水闸的启闭和水量管理运用等工作。为了随时向灌溉区作洪水预报，除青铜峡水文站经常与黄河上下游各水文站加强联系外，宁夏省人民政府水利局并在唐徕渠口专设了一处水文站。灌溉区渠道沿岸的各地人民已全部组织起来，并成立了养护渠道和管理用水小组。据贺兰、平罗、宁朔、惠农等四县不完全统计，已经成立起的养护小组即有九百九十八个，参加的人数达两万人以上。这些小组都订有养护公约和灌溉制度，并都准备了抢险的工具和物料。省人民政府水利局为了进一步加强各地养护组织的经常工作，在六月底已派出督导组赴各地进行重点检查。    （新华社）
