Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 14th: The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party was held in Warsaw from June 14th to 15th. Comrade Beirut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, delivered a report on "Strengthening the Connection Between Urban and Rural Areas in the Current Stage of Socialist Construction." After heated discussions, the meeting unanimously decided to take this report as a guide for the Party's future activities. The plenary session also elected Devolakovsky as a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Organizational Bureau.

In his report, Beirut said: The basis for determining the Party's policy in rural areas must be a profound analysis of the socio-economic changes that have taken place in rural areas since Poland's liberation. These changes are profound and rapid. The characteristic of the old era was the increasing impoverishment and bankruptcy of the basic peasant masses. But today, the material welfare and living standards of the peasants are undoubtedly improving and increasing. The socio-political activism and overall cultural level in rural areas are also increasing. Poland's industrialization and the implementation of the Six-Year Plan consolidate and expand these gains of the peasant masses. However, the current economic structure of rural areas is different from that of industry and other sectors of the national economy. In continuing to implement our socialist construction plan, the backward economic structure of rural areas, based on small-scale individual production methods, prevents the agricultural production level from being improved as it should be, and makes the imbalance between the national economy's need for agricultural products and the development of agricultural production increasingly large. In other words, until now, the development rate of agricultural production has lagged far behind the needs of the national economy. If we take the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1949 as 100, then the total value of socialist industrial output in 1951 was 162, and agriculture was 106; the total value of socialist industrial output in 1952 is estimated to be 199, while agriculture is only estimated to be 115. This ratio clearly shows the difference in the growth rate of industry and agriculture.

Beirut pointed out: Striving to accelerate the development of agricultural production and striving to greatly improve the possibility of agricultural production exists, but we have not made appropriate use of it until now. In the past three years, the socialist sector has only increased from 6 percent to 16 percent of the total agricultural output. But there are many facts that show that the rate of development can be greatly increased. For example, from the second half of 1951 to the beginning of 1952, the number of agricultural production cooperatives remained at about 3,000; it was only in the spring of this year that it increased by nearly 300. This is because the Party organizations in rural areas did not pay attention to propaganda and organizational activities aimed at developing production cooperatives. Beirut emphasized: The establishment of agricultural production cooperatives is not a temporary movement, it is the most important issue, a very difficult task of great significance. The state machine tractor stations must become the decisive factor in the development of the socialist sector of agriculture. The task of our industry must be to supply agriculture with more and more superior tractors and agricultural machinery. The development rate of the socialist sector of agriculture largely depends on the correct organization of the work of the state machine tractor stations. Party committees at all levels must not only change their attitude towards leading the work of the state machine tractor stations as soon as possible, but also change their attitude towards leading the work of state farms as soon as possible. The achievements of advanced state farms confirm the great economic and educational significance of large-scale socialized farms.

Beirut then pointed out: While we are working harder to develop and improve the socialist forms of agriculture, we must not forget for a moment that in the present and for a long period in the future, the small commodity individual economy of millions of peasants is the central issue of the economic connection between urban and rural areas. Whoever does not understand and underestimates the role of the small commodity economy in our country's economic life cannot understand and will certainly underestimate the main problems of the current stage of our development. Consolidating and expanding the alliance of the broad laboring peasant masses is the main task of our rural policy. Only by implementing a wise economic policy and adopting a fraternal attitude towards the laboring peasants, treating them as allies at every stage, can we win the peasants over to the socialist side. We must pay special attention to small and poor farmers. On the basis of expanding the state's planned assistance and on the basis of the more extensive use of the new technical conditions provided by the state machine tractor stations by the laboring peasants, the peasant economy will have every possibility of increasing productivity.

Beirut finally said: Until now, our heroic working class has been shouldering the main task of national industrialization. If we carry out more competent work in rural areas, care for the needs of the peasant masses, make millions of peasant masses more active, and further promote their conscious participation in socialist construction, we will immeasurably increase and accelerate our achievements in national industrialization, accelerate the growth rate of productivity and national defense forces, and thus accelerate the improvement of the material and cultural welfare of our people. If we implement our correct, appropriate, and far-sighted policies in all aspects, we will greatly alleviate our supply difficulties, enhance the state's regulatory role, and strengthen the economic ties between cities and villages.

    贝鲁特论加强波兰城乡联系问题
    【新华社十四日讯】华沙消息：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议于六月十四日至十五日在华沙举行。党中央委员会主席贝鲁特在会上作了“在社会主义建设的现阶段中加强城乡联系”的报告。会议经热烈讨论后，一致决定把这一个报告作为党将来活动的指针。全体会议并选出德窝拉科夫斯基为政治局委员和组织局书记。
    贝鲁特在报告中说：确定党在农村的政策的基础，必须是对于波兰解放后农村中所发生的社会经济变革的深刻的分析。这些变革是深刻的急剧的。旧时代的特点是基本农民群众的日益贫困和破产。但是今天农民的物质福利和生活水平无疑地正在增进和提高。农村中的社会—政治积极性和整个的文化水平同样也在提高着。波兰的工业化和六年计划的实施，巩固并扩大着农民群众的这些收获。但是现阶段农村的经济结构是不同于工业和国民经济的其他部门的。在继续执行我们社会主义建设的计划中，以小规模的个体生产方法为基础的农村的落后的经济结构，使农业生产水平不能得到应有的提高，并使得国民经济对农产品的需要和农业生产的发展之间的不平衡越来越大。换句话说，直到现在为止，农业生产的发展速率已大大落后于国民经济的需要。如以一九四九年工业产量和农业产量总值为一百，那么，一九五一年社会主义工业产量总值为一六二，农业为一○六；一九五二年社会主义工业的产量总值预计为一九九，而农业预计仅为一一五。这个比例清楚地表明工业和农业的增长速率的差异。
    贝鲁特指出：争取加速农业生产的发展、争取大大提高农业生产的可能性是存在的，只是我们到现在为止还没有适当地加以利用。在过去三年中，社会主义部分在农业总产量中仅从百分之六增加到百分之十六。但有许多事实表明发展的速率是可以大大增加的。例如，从一九五一年下半年到一九五二年年初，农业生产合作社始终停留在约三千个的数目上；只是在今年春天才增加了将近三百个。这是因为农村的党组织没有关心旨在发展生产合作社的宣传和组织活动。贝鲁特强调说：建立农业生产合作社不是一个一时的运动，它是一个最重要的问题，是一个意义重大的极困难的任务。国家机器拖拉机站必须成为发展农业的社会主义部分的决定性因素。我们的工业的任务必须是以越来越多的优等的拖拉机和农业机器供给农业。农业的社会主义部分的发展速率在很大的程度上取决于正确地组织国家机器拖拉机站的工作。各级党委员会不仅必须尽快改变对于领导国家机器拖拉机站工作的态度，而且也必须尽快改变对领导国家农场工作态度。先进的国家农场的成就便证实大规模的社会化农场的巨大经济意义和教育意义。
    贝鲁特接着指出：当我们以更大的努力从事发展和改善农业的社会主义形式的时候，我们一刻也不要忘记在现在和将来很长的一个时期内，数以百万计的农民群众的小商品个体经济是城乡经济联系的中心问题。谁要是不理解和低估了小商品经济在我国经济生活中的作用，谁就不能理解并且一定会低估我国发展的现阶段的主要问题。巩固和广大劳动农民群众的联盟，这是我们农村政策的主要任务。只有执行一个明智的经济政策和对劳动农民采取兄弟般的态度，在每一阶段中都把他们当作盟友，才能把农民争取到社会主义方面来。我们必须特别关心小农和贫农。在扩大国家的有计划的援助的基础上，在劳动农民更加广泛使用国家机器拖拉机站所提供的新的技术条件的基础上，农民经济将具有增加生产率的一切可能性。
    贝鲁特最后说：到现在为止，我们的英雄的工人阶级，一直担负起国家工业化的主要任务。倘若我们在农村中进行更干练的工作，关切农民群众的需要，使千百万农民群众更加活跃起来，并进一步促使他们自觉参加社会主义建设，我们将无可衡量地增加和加速我们在国家工业化方面的成就，加速生产力和国防力量的增长速率，因而加速我国人民的物质和文化福利的增进。倘若我们实行我们在各个方面正确的、适合情况的和远大的政策，我们将大大减轻我们在供应方面的困难，增强国家的调节作用，并加强城市和乡村的经济联系。
