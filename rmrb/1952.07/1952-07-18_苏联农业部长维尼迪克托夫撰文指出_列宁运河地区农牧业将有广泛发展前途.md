Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: According to TASS, Soviet Minister of Agriculture Venediktov published an article in Pravda on the 15th, stating that the completion of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal marks a new stage in the development of Soviet agriculture. The arid and semi-desert areas of Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast will have water for irrigation on 750,000 hectares of land and water supply for 2 million hectares of land. Coupled with the implementation of pasture crop rotation systems and the planting of protective forest belts, agriculture and animal husbandry in this area will expand and develop at an unprecedented rate. In the future, in addition to the original wheat, the collective farms here will also grow cotton, rice, and other crops that have never been grown here before. The planting area of vegetables, potatoes, perennial and annual pasture grasses, and other feed crops will be expanded. Irrigation will create favorable conditions for large-scale planting of fruit trees and grapes. With an adequate water supply, protective forest belts will be planted on both sides of the canals, and the dry grasslands will be turned into green land.
	Venediktov then pointed out that, according to the decision of the Soviet government, machine tractor stations using electricity will be established in the new irrigated areas of Rostov Oblast, and two such machine tractor stations will be established this year. The design work for laying power transmission lines for the use of electric tractors in these irrigated areas has been completed, and preparations for erection are underway. The electricity delivered by these transmission lines will be widely used in the most important agricultural work, such as plowing, sowing, cultivating, and harvesting. These machine tractor stations will train the necessary expert cadres and accumulate experience for the widespread use of electricity in agriculture in the future.
	Venediktov concluded by saying that, according to rough estimates, due to irrigation and water supply, this area can increase wheat production by more than 1.25 million tons, rice by 160,000 tons, cotton by tens of thousands of tons, potatoes, vegetables and melon crops by more than 600,000 tons, and feed crops by more than 1.4 million tons in the future. Due to the increase in feed crops, the number of beef cattle and dairy cows in these areas can be increased by more than 200,000 head, and the number of sheep will increase by 1 million head. At the same time, the productivity of animal products will be greatly improved. The milk production of collective farms and state farms in these areas will increase by about 300,000 tons, butter will increase by 38,000 tons, and wool will increase by almost 6,000 tons. The output of fruits and grapes will also increase greatly.

    苏联农业部长维尼迪克托夫撰文指出
    列宁运河地区农牧业将有广泛发展前途
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联农业部长维尼迪克托夫十五日在真理报发表文章说：列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的完成，标志着苏联农业发展的新阶段。罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州的干旱和半沙漠地区将有七十五万公顷土地有水灌溉，两百万公顷土地有水供应，加上实行牧草作物轮种制和植造防护林带之后，这一地区的农业和畜牧业将空前迅速地扩大和发展起来。今后，除了原有的小麦之外，这里的集体农庄还将种植棉花、稻米和其他在这里未曾种过的作物。蔬菜、马铃薯、多年生和一年生牧草以及其他饲料作物的种植面积将要扩大。灌溉将为大规模种植果树和葡萄造成有利的条件。有了充足的水量之后，水渠的两岸将种植防护林带，干燥的草原将变成一片青绿的土地。维尼迪克托夫接着指出：按照苏联政府的决定，在罗斯多夫州的新灌溉地区，将要建立起使用电力的机器拖拉机站，今年就要建立两个这样的机器拖拉机站。为了在这些灌溉区使用电气拖拉机，敷设输电线的设计工作已经完成，架设的准备工作正在进行中。由这些输电线送来的电力，将被广泛应用到最重要的农业劳动上，如犁地、播种、耕耘和收割等。这些机器拖拉机站将训练出必要的专家干部，并为将来在农业中广泛使用电力积累经验。维尼迪克托夫最后说：按照概略的估计，这个地区由于有水灌溉和供应，今后可以增产小麦一百二十五万吨以上，稻米十六万吨，棉花数万吨，马铃薯、蔬菜和瓜类作物六十万吨以上，饲料作物一百四十余万吨。由于饲料作物的增加，这些地区的食用牛和乳牛的数量将可以增加二十万头以上，羊的头数将增加一百万头。同时畜产品的生产率将大大提高，这些地区的集体农场和国家农场的牛乳产量将增加约三十万余吨，牛油将增加三万八千吨，羊毛增加几乎六千吨。果类和葡萄的产量也将大大增加。
