Towards a Happy Life
    ——Model Deeds of Yang Zhenru, a Rice Production Expert in Dachenzhuang, Ninghe County, Hebei Province
    By Qin Zheng, Ma Keming, Xu Tiankai, Wang Yutang
    (Seven) "Fellow villagers, we can't wait! Plant in the soil, find fish in the river, we must engage in production for self-salvation and compete with nature!" Yang Zhenru and Yang Zhaoqing organized the masses to catch fish, surviving the famine and getting through the winter.
    (Eight) In 1950, the government built an electric pumping station. The state-owned farm's machine farming is so convenient, the land is so flat, and the straight furrows are in a line. The farmers of Dachenzhuang are really envious! Everyone discussed: "Why don't we work together!"
    (Nine) The next spring, the village chief attended a meeting in the county and called for: "Organizing agricultural production cooperatives, distributing according to labor, and managing collectively." Yang Zhenliang carefully calculated that he alone could do the work of two people. He always wanted to work alone and felt it was reliable, fearing that cooperation would be a losing proposition. The village chief and Old Yang carefully calculated and slowly persuaded him, "Don't be afraid if you have strong labor, you will get more pay for more work." Yang Zhenliang changed his mind: "Okay! I'll join and give it a try!"
    (Ten) After the cooperative was established, a members' meeting was held for elections. Village Chief Yang was the chairman, and ten teams were organized neatly. They passed the regulations and assessed production, and work began with the sound of a bell.
    (Eleven) Yang Zhenru's team had eight people, seven of whom had been working in other places for many years. After liberation, they returned home to engage in production, and they were not experts in rice cultivation. Old Yang patiently taught them one by one, explaining the production techniques in detail. When irrigating, pay attention to the amount of water, insert a small stick as a mark. Releasing water according to the stick is error-free, and everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher.
    (Twelve) After the cooperative was established, a technical team was formed, and the state-owned farm sent people to help. Old Yang participated most actively, and everyone came up with great ideas. Combine years of experience with science, and rice must be grown well. Select good seeds, cultivate strong seedlings, and break the old conventions. The "Yinfang" rice seeds are first winnowed, and then soaked in warm water, artificially germinated quickly, and eliminating pests and diseases.

    走向幸福的生活

    （七）“乡亲们，不能等！种地土里找，捉鱼河里寻，我们要生产自救和天作门争！”杨振儒，杨兆庆，组织群众捕鱼，度荒熬过冬。
    （八）一九五○年，政府修建起电力扬水站，国营农场的机器耕种多方便，大块土地多平坦，笔直的垅沟一条线，大陈庄的农民看着真眼馋！大家纷纷议论说：“为啥咱们不合伙干！”
    （九）来年春，村长在县里开过会，号召：“组织起农业生产合作社，按劳取酬伙经营”，杨振良，细盘算，自己一个能顶两人干，总想单干靠得住，生怕合作吃亏不上算。村长和老杨细细算账慢慢劝，“劳力强不用怕，多劳多得有光沾。”杨振良转过弯：“好吧！我先加入试试看！”
    （十）合作社成立起，召开社员大会来选举，杨村长当主席，十个小队编得齐，通过章程评产量，钟声一响齐下地。
    （十一）杨振儒小队八个人，七个长年跑外乡，解放后回家搞生产，提起种稻不内行。老杨耐心一个个教，把生产技术仔细讲。浇地时，看水量，插一个小棍作标样，按棍放水没有错，大伙越干情绪越高涨。
    （十二）合作社成立了技术组，国营农场派人来帮助。老杨参加最积极，大家研究办法高，多年经验加科学，水稻一定能种好。选良种，养壮苗，打破陈规老一套，“银坊”稻种先用风选，然后再拿温水泡，人工催芽长得快，消灭病菌虫害少。
