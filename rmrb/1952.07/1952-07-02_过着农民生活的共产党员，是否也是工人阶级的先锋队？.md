    Are Communist Party Members Living as Peasants Also Pioneers of the Working Class?

    Question: If a Communist Party member of peasant origin is still working on his own private land after joining the Party, is he also a pioneer of the working class?

    Answer: The Chinese Communist Party is the party of the Chinese working class, and is the advanced and organized force of the Chinese working class. All Communist Party members are members of this advanced force, and Party members of peasant origin are no exception. A person of peasant origin who wants to be a Communist Party member, like those from other classes, must, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, recognize the Party Program and the Party Constitution, participate in a certain Party organization and work within it, obey the Party's resolutions, and pay Party dues. These conditions must be accepted by people with the level of awareness of the working class vanguard, and cannot be accepted by ordinary peasants. Therefore, a Party member who has reached this level of awareness, even if his economic status still belongs to the peasant class, has, in terms of his ideological essence, abandoned his original, i.e., peasant, position, and is standing on the position of the working class, and has become a pioneer fighter of the working class who is fighting for the cause of communism. Therefore, we must never fail to recognize them as pioneer fighters of the working class simply because they are not from the working class.

    Of course, class origin or personal background has a significant impact on a Party member's ideology. Therefore, Party members who live a peasant's economic life should especially strengthen their ideological training and overcome the influence of daily economic life on their thinking; at the same time, they should actively lead the peasants to implement mutual aid and cooperation and "organize themselves"; through the collective labor of mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives, gradually change their economic life, and prepare to finally break away from the economic status of small private owners and transform themselves into the working class or collective farmers.

### 过着农民生活的共产党员，是否也是工人阶级的先锋队？

    过着农民生活的共产党员，是否也是工人阶级的先锋队？
    问：农民出身的共产党员，入党后还在自己的私有土地上劳动，他是否也是工人阶级的先锋队？
    答：中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，是中国工人阶级的先进的有组织的部队。所有共产党员都是这一先进部队的成员之一，农民出身的党员当然也不例外。农民出身的人要作一个共产党员，和其他阶级出身的人一样，都必须按照党章规定，承认党纲和党章，参加党的一定组织并在其中工作，服从党的决议，并缴纳党费。这些条件，必须是具有工人阶级先锋队的觉悟水平的人才能接受，而不是一般农民所能接受的。因此，达到了这种觉悟水平的党员，即使他的经济地位仍属农民阶级，但从其思想本质来说，他已经放弃了原来的、即农民的立场，而站在了工人阶级的立场上，变成为共产主义事业而奋斗的工人阶级的先锋战士了。因此，决不能因为他们不是出身于工人阶级，就不认为他们是工人阶级的先锋战士。
    当然，阶级出身或个人成分，对一个党员的思想意识是有重大影响的。因此，过着农民的经济生活的党员，应该特别加强自己的思想意识的锻炼，克服日常经济生活对自己思想的影响；同时应该积极带领农民，实行互助合作，“组织起来”；通过互助组或农业生产合作社的集体劳动，来逐渐改变自己的经济生活，并准备在最后脱离小私有者的经济地位，把自己变成工人阶级或集体农民。
