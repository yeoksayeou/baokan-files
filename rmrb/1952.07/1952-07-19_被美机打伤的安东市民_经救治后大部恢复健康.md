Xinhua News Agency, Anton, 18th—Most of the citizens of Anton who were injured during the U.S. air force's indiscriminate strafing on the 11th have recovered their health thanks to the proper care of the local people's government and the enthusiastic treatment of the doctors.

    After the tragedy, district and street cadres and public security personnel in the areas subjected to U.S. aircraft strafing immediately mobilized citizens to rescue the wounded. Twenty-five lightly wounded individuals were bandaged and treated at district health clinics and then returned home to recuperate. Another twenty-five more seriously injured individuals were sent to the Liaodong Provincial Hospital and the Anton Municipal Hospital for free treatment. Elderly worker Yan Guangtian, whose left leg was injured, and his granddaughter Yan Qiuping, whose right arm was injured, are about to recover from their wounds after timely bandaging and treatment by the district health clinic. Elementary school student Wang Decai, who suffered eleven injuries all over his body, was pale and had difficulty breathing when he was admitted to the municipal hospital. After rapid bandaging, anti-inflammatory treatment, and blood transfusion by the hospital doctors, he is now out of danger. Worker Luo Dekuan, who was the most seriously injured, was unconscious when he was admitted to the municipal hospital; he was only out of danger after emergency treatment. Now his wounds are almost healed, and his limbs can move freely. Currently, twenty of the twenty-five seriously injured patients have been cured and discharged from the hospital, and the remaining five will be discharged soon.

    The local people's government has sent representatives to the hospital several times to express their sympathy to the injured citizens and to provide relief to those with financial difficulties. The injured citizens deeply appreciate the proper care provided by the people's government. Tan Shushu, a wounded silk-reeling worker, said, "I will recuperate with peace of mind and strive to recover my health as soon as possible. In the future, I will definitely use active production and wholeheartedly support the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions to thank the people's government."

    被美机打伤的安东市民
    经救治后大部恢复健康
    【新华社安东十八日电】安东十一日在美国空军滥行扫射下受伤的市民，在当地人民政府妥善照顾和医生们的热心医治下大部分已恢复健康。
    遭受美机扫射地区的区、街干部和公安工作人员，曾在惨案发生后立即动员市民抢救伤员。当时二十五名轻伤者由各区卫生所施行包扎和医治后回家休养；另二十五名伤势较重者被送入辽东省立医院和安东市立医院免费治疗。左腿受伤的老工人阎广田和他的右臂受伤的小孙女阎秋平，经区卫生所及时包扎和治疗后伤口将要痊愈。全身受伤十一处的小学生王德财，入市立医院时面色苍白、呼吸困难，经该院医生迅速包扎、消炎和输血后，现已脱离险期。伤势最重的工人罗德宽入市立医院时已失去知觉；经紧急治疗后才转危为安。现在他的伤口快要痊愈，四肢已能自由活动。目前二十五名重伤者中，已有二十名治愈出院，其余五名不久亦可出院。
    当地人民政府曾数次派出代表到医院慰问受伤市民，并对其中家庭生活困难者进行救济。负伤市民深切感谢人民政府对他们的妥善照顾。一位受伤的缫丝工人谭书传说：“我要安心休养，争取早日恢复健康。今后一定用积极生产，全力支援中国人民志愿军的实际行动来答谢人民政府。”
