People of Various Countries Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the Korean People's War Against America
Unanimously Protest U.S. Air Raids and Demand an End to the Korean War

    The Vietnamese People Support the Korean People's Struggle
    Responding to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions and following the instructions of the Vietnam National United Front and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Vietnamese workers and people from all walks of life held rallies in various locations on the 25th. Representatives from all sectors unanimously praised the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and people, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteers, and condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, all participants pledged to redouble their efforts in the war of resistance as an effective support for Korea. The rallies passed numerous resolutions denouncing U.S. imperialism's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China, the massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island, and protesting the French reactionaries' illegal arrest of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos.
    Vietnamese newspapers published commemorative special editions on this day, featuring a photograph of General Kim Il-sung on the front page and editorials commenting on the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and people, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteers. The editorial in "Cuu Quoc," the organ of the Vietnam National United Front, stated: "The Vietnamese people, shedding blood to resist French and U.S. imperialism, deeply sympathize with the suffering of the heroic Korean people. Vietnam and Korea not only share a common enemy but are also two outposts on the same anti-imperialist front. The Vietnamese people are greatly encouraged by every victory of the Korean people, and they also know that every victory of the Vietnamese people will bring excitement to the Korean people. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that the Korean people will surely achieve victory, and they also firmly believe that they themselves will achieve final victory."
    Mass Demonstration in Rangoon Demands an End to the Korean War
    More than a thousand representatives of people's organizations in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, held a "Mass Demonstration Demanding an End to the Korean War" on the 25th to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean People's War of Resistance Against Aggression.
    In his speech, Thakin Lwin, Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and chairman of the meeting, pointed out that U.S. imperialism originally妄想to conquer Korea in six months, but for two years, under the heroic blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it has suffered a shameful defeat. In their anger, the warmongers disregarded international law, used bacteriological weapons, and deliberately disrupted the armistice negotiations in an attempt to expand the war as a desperate struggle. After quoting the "Letter to All Men and Women of the World" issued by the Oslo meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council in early April this year regarding the punishment of bacteriological warfare criminals, he said: "In the face of the people of the world, any conspiracy of the warmongers is bound to be defeated." Thakin Lwin finally called on the Burmese people to bravely rise up to stop all U.S. imperialist war schemes in Burma in order to protect their own lives and safety and not suffer the same pain as the Korean people.
    The meeting unanimously passed four resolutions: 1. Immediately stop the Korean War; 2. Prohibit the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons and punish those who use such weapons; 3. All foreign troops should withdraw from Korea as soon as possible; 4. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves.
    Another dispatch: Since launching the signature campaign to demand an end to the Korean War and stop the use of bacteriological weapons, the Burmese People's Youth League has received enthusiastic support from young people from all walks of life in Burma, gaining more than 30,000 signatures in just five days.
    Pollitt Calls for Struggle to Achieve Armistice
    At the second anniversary of the Korean War, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, solemnly called on every man and woman in Britain with a sense of justice and dignity to resolutely fight to stop the Korean War.
    Pollitt wrote a special article for the London "Daily Worker" on June 28, pointing out that U.S. imperialists, with the help of Britain and other countries, have waged the most brutal war against the Korean people. Pollitt said: "Every crime that a person can commit, every violation of international law that a country can commit, U.S. imperialism has committed."
    Pollitt continued: "Despite this, the invaders have not conquered the people of Korea and China. The resistance of the Korean and Chinese people has inspired the mass movements of oppressed people in Asia and the Middle East to strive for national liberation and independence. The heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people has made a significant contribution to the cause of world peace."
    Pollitt continued: "The U.S. aggressors' plan to dominate the world has suffered a major setback, but they are still unwilling to admit defeat. They refuse to sign a Korean armistice agreement and have been undermining the armistice negotiations. On the second anniversary of the Korean War, they are preparing to launch a new offensive in Korea and are preparing to expand the war to China."
    Pollitt pointed out that the U.S. aggressors bombed the Yalu River power plants when the armistice negotiations had entered a dangerous stage, and arbitrarily disposed of 27,000 Korean prisoners of war under the pretext of "releasing civilians" when everyone knew that the prisoner of war issue was the only outstanding issue in the negotiations; the motive for this provocative action is obvious.
    Pollitt called on the British people to take action to stop the U.S.'s mad plans. He said: "The time has come to resolutely demand that every British youth be sent home immediately. The time has come to demand that British prisoners of war be allowed to return home. As many voters and factories as possible must be organized to make this demand. Everyone should submit countless resolutions to the executive committees of every trade union, the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and cooperative organizations. Give full play to the powerful and unmatched strength of the British labor movement in a united struggle."
    Pollitt concluded: "Americans, listen, the British people will never again allow a British youth to use guns, planes, or warships against the Korean and Chinese people. If the mad American robbers dare to expand the war into China, the British people will use every political and industrial weapon they have to stop such a war and to defeat the British government that supports such a war."
    People Gather Across India to Commemorate "Korea Day"
    Responding to the call of the All-India Peace Council, people across India held gatherings on June 24 to commemorate "Korea Day," demanding an immediate end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and the signing of a peace pact among the five major powers.
    The Bombay Peace Committee held a meeting to commemorate "Korea Day" at the Vanmali Hall in Bombay on the 24th. Speakers at the meeting included Karanjia, editor of the "Blitz Weekly," and Jectate, Chairman of the Bombay Textile Workers' Union (Red Flag) and a member of the Indian trade union delegation recently invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations. The speakers sharply criticized the U.S. aggression against Korea. They firmly believed that, based on the large amount of evidence brought back from China by Professor Kosambi, the accusations of U.S. imperialism's conduct of bacteriological warfare were true. They also unanimously condemned the U.S. aggressors' atrocities in massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island.
    In Calcutta, the "Korea Day Commemoration Committee," specially formed by representatives of various people's organizations and different political views, also held a meeting on the 24th. The meeting demanded that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea immediately. The chairman of the meeting, Mukherjee, editor of the Bengali newspaper "Yugantar," said: "If the U.S. aggressors blatantly disregard the joint protests of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and India and try to launch a third world war, they will inevitably meet the same fate as Tojo and Hitler."
    At the same time, many Indian newspapers and magazines also published articles criticizing U.S. imperialism's banditry in Korea and praising the heroic resistance of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The Bengali weekly "Janata" wrote in its editorial on the 21st: "Today the Korean people know that there are more than a billion people around the world supporting them. The ordinary people of the world are now determined to establish peace in Korea. The world peace movement is defending peace and freedom in Korea. The world peace movement is indestructible."
    The Bengali daily "Swadhinata" wrote in its editorial on the 26th: "We want to tell the U.S. government and its representatives in Delhi: India will never stand on the side of war criminals. India supports peace and stands on the side of freedom-loving countries. India supports Malik's proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." (Xinhua News Agency)

    各国人民纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年
    一致抗议美机暴行要求结束朝鲜战争
    越南人民声援朝鲜人民的斗争
    越南工人和各阶层人民响应世界工会联合会的号召，遵照越南国民联合阵线与越南总工会的指示，二十五日，各地都举行了大会。各阶层人民的代表在会上一致赞扬朝鲜军队和人民以及中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争，并声讨美帝国主义的罪行。同时，所有参加大会的人都保证要再接再厉地努力抗战作为对朝鲜的有效支持。各地的大会并通过了许多决议，指责美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器及在巨济岛屠杀朝中战俘，并抗议法国反动派非法逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛。
    越南各报在这一天出版了纪念特刊，在第一版刊登金日成将军的照片，并发表社论评述朝鲜军队与人民和中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争。越南国民联合阵线机关报“救国报”的社论说：为抵抗法美帝国主义而流血的越南人民，深深同情英勇的朝鲜人民的苦难。越南和朝鲜不只有共同的敌人，也是同一反对帝国主义前线的两个前哨。越南人民对朝鲜人民的每一个胜利消息都十分欢欣鼓舞，他们也知道越南人民的每一个胜利都会给朝鲜人民带来兴奋。越南人民深信朝鲜人民必将获得胜利，也深信自己必将获得最后胜利。
    仰光举行“要求停止朝鲜战争群众示威大会”
    缅甸首都仰光各人民团体代表千余人，为纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争两周年，于二十五日举行“要求停止朝鲜战争群众示威大会”。
    大会主席、缅甸保卫世界和平委员会副主席德钦礼貌在讲话中指出：美帝国主义原来妄想在六个月内征服朝鲜，但是两年来，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇打击下，已遭到可耻的失败。战争贩子们在恼羞成怒之下，竟不顾国际公法，使用了细菌武器，并故意破坏停战谈判，企图扩大战争来作垂死的挣扎。他在引述了今年四月初世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议发表的关于惩办细菌战战犯的告全世界男女书之后说：在全世界人民的面前，战争贩子的任何阴谋必然都要遭受失败。德钦礼貌最后号召缅甸人民为了保护自己的生命安全，不遭受朝鲜人民那样的苦痛，就要勇敢地起来制止美帝国主义在缅甸的一切战争阴谋。
    大会一致通过四项决议：一、立即停止朝鲜战争；二、禁止使用毒气、细菌武器，并惩办使用这种武器的人；三、外国军队一律从速退出朝鲜；四、朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己解决。
    又讯：缅甸人民青年联盟自从发动要求停止朝鲜战争、制止使用细菌武器的签名运动以来，已得到缅甸各界青年的热烈拥护，仅在五天内就得到三万多人的签名。
    波立特号召为争取停战而斗争
    英国共产党总书记波立特在朝鲜战争两周年时，庄严地号召英国每一个有正义感和尊严感的男女，坚决为停止朝鲜战争而斗争。
    波立特于六月二十八日特别为伦敦“工人日报”撰写论文，指出美帝国主义者在英国和其他国家帮助下，对朝鲜人民进行了最残酷的战争。波立特说：一个人所能犯的罪行，一个国家所能犯的违犯国际法的罪行，美帝国主义全都犯了。
    波立特接着说：尽管如此，侵略者并没有征服朝中两国人民。朝中人民的抵抗鼓舞了亚洲和中东各地被压迫人民争取民族解放和独立的群众运动。朝中人民的英勇斗争已经对世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。
    波立特继续说：美国侵略者的称霸世界的计划已经遭到了重大的挫败，但是他们还不肯认输。他们拒绝签订朝鲜停战协议，并且一直在破坏停战谈判。在朝鲜战争两周年之际，他们还在准备重新在朝鲜发动攻势，并在准备把战争扩大到中国。
    波立特指出：美国侵略者在停战谈判已经进入危险阶段的时候，竟轰炸鸭绿江发电厂，在人人都知道战俘问题是谈判唯一尚未解决的问题的时候，竟在“释放平民”的托辞下专横地处置了两万七千名朝鲜战俘；他们这种挑衅行动的动机是很明显的。
    波立特呼吁英国人民采取行动制止美国的疯狂计划。他说：现在已经到了坚决要求把每个英国青年立刻送回国的时候。现在已经到了要求使英国战俘回家的时候。必须尽可能组织许多选民和工厂提出这种要求。大家应该向每一个工会的执行委员会、职工大会最高委员会、工党的全国执行委员会以及合作社的组织提出无数个决议。在团结一致的斗争中发挥英国劳工运动的强大无比的力量。
    波立特在结语中写道：“美国人听着，英国人民绝不再让一个英国青年用枪炮、飞机或军舰对付朝中人民。如果发了疯的美国强盗竟想把战争扩大到中国境内，英国人民将利用他们所有的每一个政治和工业的武器来制止这样一个战争，并且打垮支持这样一个战争的英国政府。”
    印度各地人民集会纪念“朝鲜日”
    印度全国各地人民响应全印和平理事会的号召，于六月二十四日纷纷举行集会纪念“朝鲜日”，要求立即结束朝鲜战争、一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、并签订五大国和平公约。
    孟买和平委员会于二十四日在孟买瓦南玛里厅举行纪念“朝鲜日”大会。在会上发言的有“闪电周报”编辑卡朗吉和最近应邀到中国参加“五一”节 观礼的印度工会代表团团员、孟买纺织工人工会
    （红旗）主席杰克泰浦。发言的人都尖锐地抨击美国侵略朝鲜的行动。他们坚决认为：根据高善必教授从中国带回来的大批证据，对于美帝国主义进行细菌战的指责是真实的。他们并一致谴责美国侵略者屠杀巨济岛朝、中战俘的暴行。
    在加尔各答，由各人民团体和不同政见的代表特别组成的“纪念朝鲜日委员会”，也在二十四日召开了大会。大会要求所有外国军队立刻撤出朝鲜。大会主席、孟加拉文日报“划时代报”编辑穆开吉说：如果美国侵略者悍然不顾苏联、中国和印度人民的共同抗议，而想发动第三次世界大战，那么它必将碰到与东条和希特勒相同的命运。
    同时，印度许多报刊杂志也纷纷发表文章，抨击美帝国主义在朝鲜的强盗行为，并赞扬朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗。
    孟加拉文周刊“舆论”周刊二十一日社论写道：今天朝鲜人民都知道，在他们后面有全世界十多亿人民在支持他们。全世界的普通人民今天都决心在朝鲜建立和平。世界和平运动正在捍卫着朝鲜的和平和自由。世界和平运动是不可摧毁的。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”在二十六日的社论中写道：“我们要告诉美国政府及其在德里的代表：印度决不站在战犯的一边。印度拥护和平，站在爱好自由的国家的一边。印度拥护马立克主张和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。”　（新华社）
