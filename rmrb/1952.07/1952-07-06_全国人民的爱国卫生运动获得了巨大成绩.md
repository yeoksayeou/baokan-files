    The Nationwide Patriotic Health Campaign Has Achieved Great Success
    Feng Luren
    I. The Great Scale and Great Achievements of the Patriotic Health Campaign
    The towering crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria in Korea and within our country have aroused great indignation among the people of our country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of our country have carried out a strong anti-bacterial warfare struggle, and at the same time, since March, launched a nationwide patriotic health campaign.
    The scale of this movement is unprecedented in the history of our country. People from all walks of life across the country have actively participated in the movement. The movement reached its climax in June, and in many areas it has truly become a nationwide patriotic movement. According to very incomplete statistics, in Shandong Province and the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Chongqing alone, more than 14.4 million people participated in the large-scale environmental sanitation clean-up. In the rural areas of Jilin Province, 50 to 60 percent of the residents are able to carry out regular environmental sanitation clean-ups. Some "dead corners" in rural areas where sanitation work has always lagged behind have also been broken through in this movement. The broad masses of the people in various places have also received a profound education in cleanliness and hygiene in this movement. In the cities of Shenyang, Andong, Nanjing, Jinan, and Hangzhou alone, more than two million people have received hygiene education. In Jilin Province, general knowledge of hygiene was provided to farmers through workers' and farmers' night schools. In order to carry out this movement in an organized manner, many places actively trained sanitation work backbones. According to statistics, in Zhejiang Province alone and the three cities of Shenyang, Jinan, and Changwei, more than 640,000 sanitation workers were trained among the masses.
    Through this movement, the sanitation work of the people of our country has been greatly advanced, and the appearance of cleanliness and hygiene in many places has been completely renewed. For example, in terms of fly eradication and rat catching, according to incomplete statistics, Zhejiang Province and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Nanjing, Jinan, and Qingdao alone have eradicated more than one billion flies and captured more than 1.5 million rats. Chongqing eradicated two and a half tons of flies and more than one ton of mosquito larvae by the end of June. In terms of clearing garbage, sewage, tidying up water sources, and building public toilets: Shandong and Hebei provinces had cleared more than 1,888,000 tons of garbage by mid-June. Residents of three districts in Nanjing cleared garbage accumulated since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. In March and April, Shenyang City dredged a total of 748 kilometers of sewage ditches. By the end of June, Chongqing had repaired 670 kilometers of ditches. In Fujian Province, a sewage ditch that had not been dredged for more than 200 years was also dredged this time. In March and April, Songjiang's 27 cities and counties repaired and added more than 135,000 toilets. In the rural areas of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoxi, most of the wells have been covered. By the end of May, Tianjin had filled in or disinfected more than 4,000 acres of sewage pits and blocked more than 420,000 rat holes and tree holes. Residents of Shude Lane in the city's Ninth District filled in a stinking water pit with a history of 60 years, covering more than 20 acres and eight feet deep. In major cities, the sanitary equipment of food, meat stalls, hotels, bathhouses, barbershops and other industries has also been greatly improved under the supervision, education and management of health authorities. A large part of these industries has installed screens and screen doors, dust-proof and fly-proof covers on food, and many shop assistants have put on white work clothes and masks. Some cities have also stipulated that the tableware of the catering industry must be disinfected by boiling in boiling water. In terms of family hygiene, in towns and villages where the health campaign has been carried out well, many families have cleaned their indoor and outdoor areas very cleanly, regularly cleaned livestock pens and toilets, and arranged everything in an orderly manner. In terms of personal hygiene, the broad masses of the people have achieved the goal of not drinking raw water, not eating cold food, taking frequent baths, and frequently washing clothes and dismantling and washing bedding.
    Through this movement, the broad masses of the people have further realized the importance of sanitation work, and they feel that "cleanliness is glorious." The backward idea of "if you don't do it cleanly, you will get sick if you eat it" has also been swept away. For example, in Hangzhou City, 92% of all households are completely clean and basically clean.
    Due to the development of this movement, the incidence of local diseases in various places this spring and summer has been greatly reduced compared with the same period last year.
    II. Why We Were Able to Achieve Such Great Success
    The reason why this patriotic health campaign was able to achieve such great success is mainly due to the following reasons:
    First, because this movement is a truly mass movement, the broad masses of the people have actively participated in this movement. The success of this movement once again demonstrated the superiority of our country's democratic system and the incalculable strength of the people of the whole country under this system. Such a large-scale mass health campaign was simply unimaginable in the era of Kuomintang rule or in capitalist countries, but it is possible in our new China under the people's democratic dictatorship. People across the country have realized that carrying out health campaigns is of great importance to improving people's health and strengthening national construction, so they have actively participated in the patriotic health campaign, just like actively participating in the campaign to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" movements.
    Second, the leadership in various places generally attached great importance to the patriotic health campaign. They were able to mobilize and rely on the masses, and provide specific guidance, and give play to the strength of various organizations. For example, the mayor of Jinan City personally led the work, and the district heads, township heads, village heads, factory directors, and school principals below the city level took charge. In the work arrangement, it is from top to bottom, the head mobilizes, and it is implemented layer by layer. The city also held cadre meetings, various representative meetings, activist meetings, mass meetings, and resident (villager) group meetings to convey, discuss, and specifically arrange work. Other places such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Qingdao also achieved remarkable results in sanitation work due to the attention of leaders at all levels and the full mobilization of the masses.
    Third, since liberation, thanks to the active efforts of the people's governments at all levels, the health undertakings of the people of our country have originally developed, and the level of health science in our country has been greatly improved, which has become a good foundation for us to carry out mass health campaigns this year. As everyone knows, before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not care about the health of the people at all, and the broad masses of the people were in a state of extreme poverty, so there was no condition to talk about hygiene at all; after liberation, the people's economic life gradually improved, and the Communist Party and the People's Government paid great attention to improving the people's health and hygiene, so that the broad masses of the people had the conditions to talk about hygiene. For example, in Northeast China, based on the planned consolidation and development of people's health organizations by the People's Government in the past three years, the health level of the people in Northeast China has been greatly improved. In areas where the infant mortality rate was more than 50% in the past, it has now dropped to 5%. Thanks to the widespread vaccination in Shanghai, no smallpox patients have been found since October 1951. No case of true cholera has been found in the country for three years. These have become favorable conditions for us to continue to advance the health work of the people of our country.
    III. We Must Continue to Carry Out the Patriotic Health Campaign
    In the patriotic health campaign, although we have achieved remarkable results, we must never be satisfied with these results, but must continue to work hard. At present, from a national perspective, the development of the health campaign is still very uneven, and the movement is not deep enough in some places. In some areas, some organs, especially some rural areas, the movement has not yet been launched. On the other hand, American robbers are still continuing their germ warfare, and July, August, and September are seasons when diseases are prone to occur. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to carry out this movement universally, deeply, and persistently.
    In places where the movement has not been well carried out, we should still vigorously do a good job in environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, continue to carry out the work of eradicating flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and catching rats, and pay attention to managing water sources, filling in water pits, clearing garbage, moving and building public toilets and family toilets, tidying up livestock pens, and blocking tree holes and rat holes. These tasks must truly achieve "no omission in one place, no omission in one household," and penetrate into every unit and every corner. In places where the movement has already been carried out, we must consolidate our achievements, maintain consistency, implement a clean responsibility system, and make the broad masses of the people fully develop good habits of loving cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, in cities, we must also strengthen the education and management of food industry workers and employees, so that they have a correct understanding of the cleanliness and hygiene of food and consciously take responsibility for the health of the people. Education should also be strengthened among cooks and housewives in organs and enterprises, so that they regard protecting the cleanliness and hygiene of food as their important responsibility.
    Among workers and peasants, in the future, the patriotic health campaign should be combined with the movement to increase production and practice economy, so that workers and peasants understand the principle that "only with good health can we increase production and resist US aggression and aid Korea." Workers in Qingdao City listed doing a good job in sanitation and hygiene as a competition condition in the Red May competition, and Zhao Gezhuang in Laixi, Shandong combined production and drought prevention with sanitation and hygiene, and these practices are worth emulating in various places.

    全国人民的爱国卫生运动获得了巨大成绩
    冯鲁仁
    一、爱国卫生运动的巨大规模和巨大成绩
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国境内撒布细菌的滔天罪行，激起了我全国人民的极大愤怒。我国人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，进行了强有力的反细菌战的斗争，同时从三月份起展开了一个全国范围的爱国卫生运动。
    这一运动规模的宏大，在我国历史上是空前未有的。全国各阶层人民都积极地参加到运动中来。运动到六月进入高潮，在许多地区已真正成为全民性的爱国运动。据极不完全统计，仅山东省和北京、天津、重庆三市，参加环境卫生大扫除的人民群众即达一千四百余万人。吉林省农村居民有百分之五十到六十都能够定期进行环境卫生的大扫除。农村中一些卫生工作一向落后的“死角”，也在这次运动中突破了。各地广大人民群众在这次运动中并受到了一次深刻的清洁卫生的教育。仅沈阳、安东、南京、济南、杭州等市，受到卫生教育的人民群众就在两百万以上。吉林省通过工人和农民夜校，对农民普遍进行了卫生常识教育。为了有组织地开展这一运动，许多地方都积极训练了卫生工作骨干。据统计，仅浙江省一省和沈阳、济南、昌潍等三个城市即在群众中训练了六十四万余卫生工作人员。
    经过这一运动，我国人民群众的卫生工作已向前大大推进了一步，许多地方的清洁卫生面貌已经焕然一新。例如在灭蝇、捕鼠方面，据不完全统计，仅浙江省和北京、天津、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、南京、济南、青岛等市即灭蝇达十亿多只，捕鼠在一百五十万以上，重庆市到六月底止，灭蝇两吨半，灭孑孓一吨多。在清除垃圾、污水，整理水源，修建公共厕所方面：山东、河北两地到六月中旬为止，即已清除垃圾一百八十八万八千余吨。南京三区的居民清除了从太平天国时代积下来的垃圾。沈阳市在三、四月份共疏通污水沟长达七百四十八公里。重庆市到六月底止，修理水沟六百七十公里。福建省有一条两百多年来未加疏浚的污水沟，这次也疏通了。松江二十七个市、县在三、四月份修理和增设了十三万五千多个厕所。吉林、黑龙江、辽西等地农村大部分水井都加了盖。天津市到五月底止，填平或消毒污水坑面积达四千余亩，堵塞鼠洞、树洞四十二万多个。该市九区树德里的居民填平了有六十年历史的二十多亩大、八尺深的一个臭水坑。在各大城市中，饮食、肉摊、旅馆、浴池、理发等行业的卫生设备，在卫生机关的督促、教育和管理下，也有了很大的改进。这些行业中有很大一部分已安装纱窗、纱门，食品上安设防尘防蝇覆盖，许多店员都穿上了白色工作服和带上了口罩。某些城市并已规定了饮食业的食器必须用开水煮沸消毒。在家庭卫生方面，凡是卫生运动开展得好的城镇和农村，许多家庭的室内室外都打扫得很清洁，经常清理畜圈、厕所，一切物品都安置得有条不紊。在个人卫生方面，广大人民群众做到了不喝生水，不吃冷食，勤洗澡，经常清洗衣服和拆洗被褥。
    经过这个运动，广大群众都进一步认识了卫生工作的重要性，而且感到“清洁光荣”。“不干不净，吃了化病”的落后思想，也一扫而光。如杭州市全部住户中，完全清洁和基本清洁的占百分之九十二。
    由于这一运动的开展，今年春夏之交各地地方性疾病的发病率较去年同期已大为减少。
    二、我们为什么能够取得这样大的成绩
    这次爱国卫生运动，所以能够取得这样巨大的成绩，主要有以下几个原因：
    第一，是因为这一运动是真正群众性的运动，广大人民群众都积极参加了这个运动。这次运动的成功又一次显示了我国人民民主制度的优越性以及在这种制度下全国人民所发挥的不可估计的力量。这样广大规模的群众性的卫生运动，在国民党统治时代或资本主义国家是根本不可想像的，但在我们人民民主专政的新中国却就是可能的了。全国各地人民由于都已认识到开展卫生运动对于增进人民健康和增强国家建设有着极大的重要性，所以他们都像积极参加抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革和“三反”、“五反”运动一样，积极地参加了爱国卫生运动。
    第二，各地在开展爱国卫生运动时，领导上一般都很重视。他们都能发动与依靠群众，并给予具体指导，发挥各种组织的力量。例如济南市市长亲自动手领导，市以下的则由区长、乡长、村长、工厂厂长、学校校长掌握。在工作布置上是由上而下，首长动员，层层贯彻。该市并召开干部会、各种代表会、积极分子会、群众会以及居民（村民）小组会，传达、讨论和具体布置工作。其他如像北京、天津、南京、青岛等地，也是由于各级领导的重视和充分发动了群众，因而使卫生工作获得了显著的成绩。
    第三，是因为解放以来，在各级人民政府的积极努力下，我国人民的卫生事业原来已经有了发展，我国卫生科学的水平已经大大提高，这就成为我们今年开展群众性的卫生运动的良好基础。大家知道，在解放前，国民党反动政府根本不关心人民的健康，而广大人民又处在极端贫困的状态中，所以根本就没有讲卫生的条件；解放后，人民的经济生活逐渐得到改善，而共产党和人民政府又以极大力量注意改进人民保健卫生事业，使广大人民有了讲卫生的条件。例如在东北，三年来在人民政府有计划地巩固和发展人民保健组织的基础上，东北人民的健康水平大为提高。过去婴儿死亡率在百分之五十以上的地区，现已下降到百分之五。上海市由于普遍种痘的结果，从一九五一年十月到现在没有发现过一个天花病人。在全国范围内已经有三年没有发现过一个真性霍乱病人。这些就成为我们把我国人民群众的卫生工作继续向前推进的有利条件。
    三、必须继续开展爱国卫生运动
    在爱国卫生运动中，我们虽已取得了显著的成绩，但我们绝不能满足于这些成绩，而必须继续努力。现在，从全国来说，卫生运动的发展还很不平衡，有些地方运动还不够深入。有些地区、有些机关、特别是有些农村，运动至今尚未展开。另一方面，美国强盗仍在继续进行细菌战，七、八、九月份又是疾病容易流行的季节。所以，我们还必须继续努力，普遍、深入和持久地开展这一运动。
    在运动尚未很好开展的地方，仍应大力搞好环境卫生和个人卫生工作，继续展开灭蝇、灭蚊、灭虱、灭蚤、捕鼠工作，并注意管理水源，填平水坑，清除垃圾，迁移和修建公共厕所及家庭厕所，整理畜圈，堵塞树洞、鼠洞等项工作。要使这些工作真正达到“一地不漏，一户不遗”，深入到每个单位，每个角落。在运动已经开展的地方，要巩固成绩，保持经常，实行清洁责任制，使广大人民群众完全养成爱好清洁卫生的良好习惯。此外，在城市中，还要加强对食品业者和职工的教育和管理，使其对饮食品的清洁卫生有正确的认识，自觉地对人民健康负责。在机关、企业的炊事人员和家庭主妇中，也应加强教育，使他们把保护饮食的清洁卫生视为自己的重要责任。
    在工农群众中，今后应使爱国卫生运动和增产节约运动相结合，使工人和农民懂得“只有身体健康，才能增加生产，抗美援朝”的道理。青岛市工人在红五月竞赛中把做好清洁卫生工作列为竞赛条件，山东莱西赵格庄结合生产防旱进行清洁卫生工作，这些做法值得各地仿效。
