    New Atmosphere in the North China Bureau After the "Three-Anti" Movement

    Since the "Three-Anti" Movement in the organs of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially after the first Party Representative Conference held from March 26 to April 1, the work and study of the entire organ has presented a new atmosphere.

    The three tasks proposed by the Party Representative Conference of the North China Bureau organs—strengthening political and ideological leadership, improving organizational life, and improving administrative work of the organs—are being conscientiously implemented. In the past three and a half months, the Party Committee of the North China Bureau organs has grasped the central link of strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Since the beginning of June, a study of "On Practice" has been launched among cadres. In the past month, Comrade Yang Xianzhen was invited to give lectures three times, and comrades participating in theoretical studies repeatedly read "On Practice." After deliberation by study groups, and with the branch as the unit, several study discussions were held. The comrades' enthusiasm for learning is very high. Everyone not only adhered to the study system, but also many comrades took time out of their evening rest to study on their own. In the study discussions, the speeches were generally enthusiastic and serious, and some even debated the issues in the study in the dining room and dormitory.

    During the learning process, the Party Committee of the organs closely monitored and grasped the learning progress and learning situation of each branch, and provided timely and effective guidance, so that the learning of the entire organ could gradually move forward. For example, at the beginning of the study, some units had not yet understood the content of "On Practice" and emphasized linking with reality or checking work. After discovering this phenomenon, the Party Committee of the organs promptly pointed out that we should first study the documents in depth. The purpose of linking with reality at present is to understand the basic viewpoints in "On Practice," not to check the work away from the study of "On Practice"; at the same time, it prompted the focus of research. In addition, although each unit established learning counselors at the beginning of the study, they did not play their due role. In response to this situation, the Party Committee of the organs instructed each branch to form a learning counseling group composed of the branch propaganda committee member and the learning counselor, responsible for researching and answering the questions raised by the comrades in the study. The Party Committee of the organs also compiled the questions raised by the entire organ in the study and provided them to each branch for reference, to inspire the comrades to further delve into the problems. At present, many questions have been raised in the deliberation and discussion of each branch, and in general, the questions are relatively specific. When discussing these issues, everyone had fundamental differences of opinion on certain specific issues. Therefore, the Party Committee of the organs requires each branch to concentrate the issues and arguments, organize everyone to start discussions from specific issues, and solve these issues from a fundamental point of view, so as to further deepen the study and enable everyone to improve theoretically.

    In order to strengthen the study of current affairs and policies, the Party Committee of the organs improved and strengthened the reporting system, and organized report meetings every month. From the Party Representative Conference to the present three and a half months, Comrades Liu Lantao, Wang Congwu, and Ping Jiesan have successively reported on issues such as the current situation and current work, cadre policies and cadre style, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the understanding of the bourgeoisie, the eight conditions for party member standards, and the United Front work. These reports were warmly welcomed by the comrades. After each report, each unit conducted serious discussions in conjunction with their work. These reports and discussions were of great educational significance to the comrades, enabling everyone to systematically understand the Party's various policies and improve their policy level. At the same time, the responsible comrades of each department also regularly gave reports at the cadre meetings of each department and commission, summarizing work, or conveying the intentions and instructions of the leaders of the North China Bureau in conjunction with the work of their own departments, and solving the ideological problems of the cadres according to the actual situation. Some sections and divisions have established more specific and flexible small report meetings. In addition, the Party Committee of the North China Bureau organs also adopted other methods, such as organizing leaders to read telegrams, organizing general cadres to discuss relevant documents in Party publications, and organizing work-study personnel to read newspapers and attend political classes, to strengthen the political and ideological and current affairs policy education of the staff, which has achieved good results.

    After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the leadership of the Party Committee of the organs was strengthened, the cooperation between the administrative side and the branch was closer, and everyone paid more attention to the work of the organ branch than before, which provided important conditions for improving organizational life. Now, every party member is living a strict organizational life. The Party Committee uniformly stipulates that there is one Party Day every week and four Party Days every month. The activities of these four Party Days are allocated as follows: one group meeting, one branch meeting, and the remaining two times to study documents in Party publications. The branch committee conducts appropriate criticism and education for party members in response to the main ideological problems of each period. In order to promote democracy, strengthen ties between superiors and subordinates, and accept the experience of democratic reform in the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Standing Committee of the North China Bureau stipulated that cadre meetings should be held regularly to discuss work and improve leadership. The Standing Committee has held the second cadre meeting above the level of section chief on schedule (once every three months), listening to everyone's opinions and suggestions on leadership. Each department also formulated systems according to the specific situation, and followed the method of the Standing Committee to hold cadre meetings to solve problems. This has strengthened the relationship between leaders and those being led.

    Like other aspects of work, the administrative work of the organs has also been significantly improved. This improvement was achieved by relying on the following practices: revising systems, democratic management, strengthening inspection, and carrying out competitions. Based on the experience of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the General Office formulated a half-year work plan outline, and its subordinate sections and divisions also formulated specific implementation plans, which were formally announced at the General Office staff meeting. At the same time, the General Office also adopted democratic methods to formulate and improve a series of administrative and secretarial work systems and organ welfare systems, concentrating and fixing many good suggestions from the organ staff, so that the work gradually shifted from passive to active. The administrative departments of the organs paid attention to solving problems with democratic management methods. The original mass organizations of the organs, such as the various committees for cultural entertainment, meals, and family relief, also held congresses, conducted general re-elections, strengthened the ties with the administrative leadership, and became organizations with powers and responsibilities that can solve problems. In addition, the Party Committee of the organs and the general branch and branch also established life and welfare committees to help improve the welfare work of the organs. In order to strengthen the links between various departments within the organs, the General Office regularly held joint meetings of the directors of the offices of each department and commission and relevant administrative and office meetings, and sent people to various departments to actively solicit opinions, or held informal symposiums to study and solve relevant problems. While improving various tasks, inspection work was also strengthened, an inspection system was formulated, and various inspections were carried out regularly or irregularly (such as inspections of various warehouses and the hygiene of the organs). The General Office and each department and commission had dedicated personnel responsible for supervising and inspecting the handling of official documents, and regularly reported on the situation of supervision and inspection. In addition, the General Office also hosted monthly group inspections of the hygiene and equipment conditions of dormitories and public places, as well as other administrative and secretarial work, to identify problems and solve them.

    After the Party Representative Conference of the North China Bureau organs, each unit gradually overcame the phenomenon of lack of management and education for work-study personnel, and launched a model selection competition among work-study personnel from May. In the past two months, this movement has achieved preliminary results. First of all, the ideological awareness of the work-study personnel has been generally improved. They have basically overcome the erroneous view of despising their own work, and have begun to exert their enthusiasm and creativity, and have found many "tricks" in their work. For example, Gao Zhide, the driver of the automobile team who drives the 1941 Ford car, used to drive 30 miles per gallon of oil, but now it has increased to 56 and a half miles (under the condition that coasting is not allowed); the communications class still uses two people to deliver letters to 45 units, which used to take five hours by car, but now only takes two and a half hours by bicycle; Zhu Dequan, the cook who cooks large pot dishes, used to burn 150 kilograms of coal per stove every day, but after modifying the stove, the coal consumption was reduced to 90 kilograms. Secondly, the learning enthusiasm of the work-study personnel has also increased. The organ's spare-time school has specially organized four crash literacy classes, and all illiterate comrades and comrades with very little literacy have participated in the study. Among them, two illiterate people have learned 2,017 characters after 75 hours of study, and can read newspapers and write letters. Due to the influence of the work-study personnel competition movement, the cadres of the General Office system have also initially launched a competition to improve their work. Now, this movement is continuing to develop.

### 华北局机关“三反”运动以后的新气象

    华北局机关“三反”运动以后的新气象
    中共中央华北局机关在“三反”运动以后，特别是在三月二十六日到四月一日举行的第一次党代表大会以后，整个机关的工作和学习呈现着一片新气象。
    华北局机关党代表大会提出的加强政治思想领导、健全组织生活、改进机关行政工作的三项任务，正被认真执行。三个半月来，华北局机关党委会抓紧了加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习这
    一中心环节。自六月初开始，在干部中开展了“实践论”的学习。一个月来曾请杨献珍同志讲课三次，参加理论学习的同志都反覆地阅读了“实践论”。经过学习小组的酝酿，并以支部为单位进行了若干次学习讨论。同志们的学习情绪很高，大家不仅坚持了学习制度，而且有不少同志还抽出晚上休息的时间进行自修。在学习讨论中一般发言都较热烈、认真，有的在饭厅中、寝室内也争论学习中的问题。
    在学习过程中，机关党委会密切地注意并掌握了各个支部的学习进度和学习情况，及时地进行了有效的指导，使整个机关的学习得以逐步前进。例如，开始学习时，有些单位还没有把“实践论”的内容弄清楚，就强调联系实际或检查工作。机关党委会发现这种现象后，就及时指出，应当首先深入学习文件，目前联系实际的目的，是为了弄通“实践论”中的基本观点，不是脱离“实践论”的学习去检查工作；同时提示了研究重点。另外，在学习文件之初，各单位虽设立了学习辅导员，但并没有起到应有的作用。针对这种情况，机关党委会指示各支部，由支部宣传委员和学习辅导员组成学习辅导小组，负责研究和解答同志们在学习中所提出的问题。机关党委会还把全机关在学习中所提出的问题汇集起来，提供各支部参考，以启发同志们进一步钻研问题。目前各支部在酝酿及讨论中所提出的问题很多，一般说，问题都提得比较具体。在讨论这些问题的时候，大家在某些具体问题上发生了根本观点的分歧。因此，机关党委会要求各支部把问题和论点加以集中，组织大家从具体问题出发展开讨论，把这些问题从根本观点上加以解决，以求学习进一步深入，使大家从理论上能提高一步。
    为了加强时事、政策学习，机关党委会改进并健全了报告员制度，每月都要组织报告会。从党代表大会以后到现在的三个半月，已由刘澜涛、王从吾、平杰三等同志先后报告了有关目前形势和当前工作、干部政策和干部作风、农村互助合作运动、对资产阶级的认识、党员标准的八项条件、统一战线工作等问题。这些报告都受到了同志们的热烈欢迎。每次报告后，各单位都结合工作进行了认真的讨论。这些报告和讨论对同志们的教育意义很大，使大家系统地了解了党的各种政策，提高了大家的政策水平。同时各部门负责同志还定期在各部、委的干部会议上作报告，总结工作，或结合本部门工作传达华北局领导方面的意图和指示，并根据实际情况解决干部的思想问题。有的处、科则建立了更具体更灵活的小报告会。此外，华北局机关党委会还采取了其他方法，如组织领导人员阅读电报，组织一般干部讨论党刊上的有关文件，组织勤工人员读报和上政治课等，来加强工作人员的政治思想和时事政策的教育，这都收到了良好效果。
    “三反”运动以后，机关党委会的领导加强了，行政方面和支部的配合更加密切，大家对机关支部工作也较前重视，这就给健全组织生活提供了重要条件。现在，每一个党员都过着严格的组织生活。党委会统一规定：每星期有一个党日，每月有四个党日。这四个党日的活动是这样分配的：开小组会一次，开支部大会一次，其余两次学习党刊上的文件。支部委员会针对党员在每一时期的主要思想问题，进行适当的批评、教育。为发扬民主，密切上下联系，接受“三反”运动中民主改革的经验，华北局常委会规定定期召开讨论工作、改进领导的干部会议。常委会已按期（三个月一次）召开了第二次处长以上的干部会议，听取了大家对领导方面的意见和建议。各部门也根据具体情况，分别订立制度，效法常委会召开干部会议的办法来解决问题。这样就密切了领导和被领导之间的关系。
    和其他各方面的工作一样，机关行政工作也有了显著改进。这种改进是依靠下述的作法达到的：即修订制度、民主管理、加强检查、开展竞赛。根据
    “三反”运动的经验，办公厅制订了半年工作计划大纲，其所属各处、科也分别制订了具体实施计划，这些计划都在全厅工作人员大会上正式宣布。同时，办公厅还采用民主方法订立和改进了一系列的行政、秘书工作制度和机关福利制度，把机关工作人员的许多好的建议集中地固定下来，使工作由被动逐渐转向主动。机关行政部门则注意了用民主管理的方法解决问题。机关原有的群众性的组织，如文化娱乐、伙食、家属救济等各种委员会，也都召开了大会，普遍进行了改选，加强了和行政领导之间的联系，成为有职有权、能解决问题的组织。此外，机关党委会和总支、支部也都设立了生活福利委员，以帮助改进机关福利工作。为加强机关内各部门之间的联系，办公厅定期召开了各部、委办公室主任联席会议和有关行政、办公等会议，并派人到各部门主动徵求意见，或召开不拘形式的座谈会，研究并解决有关问题。和改进各种工作同时，也加强了检查工作，订立了检查制度，定期或不定期地进行了各种检查（如对于各种仓库及机关卫生情况的检查）。办公厅和各部、委都有专人负责督促和检查公文的办理，并定期汇报督促和检查的情况。此外，每月还由办公厅主持，分组检查宿舍、公共场所的卫生状况和设备状况以及其他有关行政、秘书工作，以便发现问题，加以解决。
    华北局机关党代表大会以后，各单位逐步克服了对勤工人员缺乏管理教育的现象，从五月份起，在勤工人员中展开了评选模范竞赛运动。两个多月来，这一运动已获得初步成绩。首先，勤工人员的思想觉悟普遍提高，基本上克服了卑视本身工作的错误观点，开始发挥了积极性、创造性，并在工作中找到了许多“窍门”。如汽车队驾驶一九四一年式福特汽车的高志德，过去每加仑油行车三十里，现在激增至五十六里半（在不准溜车的条件下）；通讯班还是用两个人送四十五个单位的信，过去用汽车送需五小时，现在用自行车送只需两小时半；炒大锅菜的炊事员朱德全，过去每天每炉烧煤一百五十斤，改装炉灶后，烧煤降低到九十斤。其次，勤工人员的学习情绪也更加高涨了，机关业余学校专门组织了四个速成识字班，全部文盲及认字很少的同志都参加了学习。其中有两个文盲，经过七十五小时的学习，已识字两千零十七个，能够看报写信了。由于勤工人员竞赛运动的影响，办公厅系统的干部也初步掀起了改进工作的竞赛。现在，这一运动正在继续开展中。
