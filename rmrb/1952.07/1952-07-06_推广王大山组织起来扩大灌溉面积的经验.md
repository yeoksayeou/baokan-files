Promote Wang Dashan's Experience in Organizing to Expand Irrigation Area

    Linbao Village in Lixian County, Hebei Province, has a total of eighty-seven wells. Last year, the area of land irrigated by these wells expanded from 1,942 mu to 6,000 mu, an increase of 209% compared to the original area. Wang Dashan, a farmer in the village, used one of his waterwheels to irrigate only 29 mu originally, but during the sowing period, he irrigated 148 mu, more than four times the original area.

    This fact demonstrates that there is still abundant potential strength hidden within our country's irrigation work. Fully utilizing this potential strength is an important way to overcome drought and a very important task in developing irrigation. Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces have more than 560,000 waterwheels and more than 2.45 million wells. The average irrigation area per waterwheel is currently less than 20 mu. If these waterwheels and wells are fully utilized, the irrigated area can be increased by tens of millions of mu.

    Improving irrigation management and overcoming the threat of drought is a very urgent task at present. Promoting the experience of Linbao Village in Lixian County and Wang Dashan in expanding the irrigation area of waterwheels and wells is an important method to improve irrigation management. We must conduct collective education for farmers, break down their conservative ideas regarding water use and farming techniques, and, during the drought resistance movement, use the farmers' own experience to educate them and establish the idea that "man can conquer nature." Wang Dashan's active organization and leadership of farmers, implementation of unity and mutual assistance, rational use of existing irrigation equipment, improvement of irrigation methods, saving water, and diligent and shallow hoeing are all worth learning from for farmers in various regions.

    推广王大山组织起来扩大灌溉面积的经验
    河北蠡县林堡村共有八十七眼水井，去年这些水井浇地的面积，由一千九百四十二亩扩大到六千亩，比原来增加百分之二百零九。该村农民王大山的一部水车，原来只浇地二十九亩，在播种期间，浇地达到一百四十八亩，比原来增加四倍以上。
    这个事实证明了我国的灌溉事业中还蕴藏着丰富的潜在力量，充分发挥这些潜在力量，是战胜干旱的重要办法，也是发展灌溉事业的极重要的任务。河北、平原、山西、山东、陕西几省，现有水车五十六万多部，水井二百四十五万多眼，每部水车的灌溉面积，现在平均还不到二十亩，如果把这些水车、水井充分利用起来，将可以增加几千万亩的灌溉面积。
    改善灌溉管理，战胜旱灾的威胁，这是当前非常紧迫的任务。发扬蠡县林堡村和王大山扩大水车水井灌溉面积的经验，是改善灌溉管理的一项重要的办法。我们必须对农民进行集体教育，打破农民在用水方面和耕作技术方面的保守思想，并在抗旱运动中，用农民自己的经验，教育农民确立“人定胜天”的思想。王大山积极组织领导农民，实行团结互助，合理使用现有的灌溉设备，改进灌溉方法，节省用水，勤锄浅锄，这些都是值得各地农民认真学习的。
