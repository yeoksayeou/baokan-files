    Broadly Cultivate Technicians Among Workers
    Our motherland is on the eve of large-scale economic construction. In order to carry out economic construction, it is necessary to accumulate sufficient funds, add new machines, expand the ranks of workers... What is particularly needed is an increase in technical cadres. Because in a large country like China, with the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship and the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it is relatively easy to solve the difficulties of funds, machines, and labor sources, while technical cadres require a longer period of training and cannot be increased rapidly. It is estimated that in the next five or six years, the national economic construction will require approximately 150,000 senior technical and management cadres and approximately 500,000 intermediate and junior technical cadres. The current training institutions and training speed are obviously far behind this need.
    In order to rapidly build our motherland, we must use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel. A steel plant in Northeast China adopted an accelerated method of training technical workers, enabling them to take on the work of duty technicians after a short-term training of six months and a special training of three to six months. Using this method, the technical personnel trained by the plant in three to five years, in addition to meeting the needs of the existing iron-smelting furnaces, can also equip the duty technicians of five blast furnaces. Undoubtedly, this is a good way to solve the shortage of technical personnel.
    However, there are still some people who stubbornly cling to old views, believing that workers have a low level of education and cannot learn technical principles; that learning also takes a long time. They do not realize that New China has provided unprecedented learning opportunities for the working people, and that the working people can infinitely develop their talents and wisdom in New China and constantly create miracles. Li Feng'en, a technician at an iron-smelting plant, only studied for one year and seven months in the old society, and was expelled from school because he could not afford boy scout uniforms. Now, he has become a technician in less than a year, which is a good illustration. Moreover, technicians trained from workers, because they have long-term practical operating experience and are closely connected with the masses, often achieve better results in leading production. This can also be proven by the fact that Li Feng'en's team is a high-quality product team.
    Therefore, the leading comrades of all factories and mining enterprises must attach importance to and absorb the experience of a steel plant in Northeast China, and more broadly cultivate technical personnel among workers. (Attached pictures)

    广泛地在工人中培养技术员
    我们祖国正处在大规模经济建设的前夕。为了进行经济建设，就需要积累充足的资金，增添新式的机器，扩大工人的队伍……特别需要的，是增加技术干部。因为像中国这样一个大国，建立了人民民主专政，有了苏联及人民民主国家的援助，要解决资金、机器和劳动力来源的困难，是比较容易一些的，而技术干部呢，则需要较长时间的训练，不能够迅速增加。据估计，今后五、六年内，全国经济建设约需高级技术干部和管理干部十五万人左右，中级和初级技术干部五十万人左右。以目前的训练机构和训练速度，显然远远赶不上这一需要。
    为了迅速建设我们的祖国，就必须用革命的精神和革命的办法来解决技术人员不足的困难。东北某炼铁厂采用速成办法培养技术工人，使之在六个月的短期训练和三至六个月的专门培养后，即能担任值班技术员的工作。用这个办法，该厂三、五年后所培养出的技术人员，除供给现有炼铁炉的需要外，还可配备五座高炉的值班技术员。无疑的，这是一个解决技术人员不足的良好办法。
    可是，也还有这样一些人，他们死抱着陈旧的观点，认为工人文化程度低，学不会技术原理；要学习也得花费很长时间。他们没有认识到新中国已给劳动人民提供了空前的学习机会，劳动人民在新中国可以无限发挥其才能与智慧，并不断地创造出奇迹。一个炼铁厂的技工李凤恩，在旧社会读了一年零七个月的书，只因为没钱作童子军服就被赶出学校，而现在呢，不到一年就学成了技术员，这就是很好的说明。而且，从工人中培养出的技术员，由于他们有长期实际操作经验，又和群众有密切联系，他们领导生产，往往还会获得更好的成绩，这也可以从李凤恩班是产品质量优良班的事实中得到证明。
    因此，一切厂矿企业的领导同志，必须重视和吸取东北某炼铁厂的经验，更广泛地在工人中培养技术人员。（附图片）
