    The Committee System in Trade Union Work
    The Soviet "Labor News" published an editorial on May 30th, pointing out the importance of implementing collective leadership in trade union work. The following is an abstract.
    The committee system in work, the principle of collective leadership, is the most important characteristic of Soviet trade union democracy. This principle fully conforms to the spirit and content of trade union work as a school for training management personnel and a communist school, ensuring the active participation of the broad masses in all trade union work.
    The committee system in work is a collective system implemented in the discussion, formulation, and implementation of measures by trade union organizations. Only by relying on collective experience, and only with the active participation of all personnel, can the tasks assigned to Soviet trade unions by the party of Lenin and Stalin be successfully completed.
    The collective leadership system is the basic method of trade union work, an effective means of training cadres, and a true school for educating them. The practical experience of all trade union work clearly confirms that the more actively trade union members participate in the work of the trade union committee, the more the trade union leaders rely on the experience of the masses, the more effective the work of the trade union organization will be.
    The violation of the committee system principle will inevitably lead to serious shortcomings and failures in work. The example of Comrade Berdyaev, the former chairman of the Turkmen Republic Petroleum Workers' Trade Union Committee, can serve as a mirror in this regard. Comrade Berdyaev did not feel that he was elected to his post to work and be responsible to the Presidium. He behaved like a bad administrator, blindly believing in the power of documents and orders. Trade union work requires consideration of the experience and opinions of all personnel, but he acted arbitrarily and did not absorb activists to participate in the work. This violation of the principle of collective leadership eventually led to a phenomenon of no supervision, creating an irresponsible situation, and resulting in serious violations of financial discipline in the trade union. The Presidium of the Turkmen Republic Trade Union Committee dismissed Berdyaev as a person who could not meet the minimum requirements of a trade union leader, and this punishment was very correct.
    The collective leadership organ of the trade union is the trade union committee or the trade union council, which is elected by the general assembly, representative meeting, or congress by secret ballot. However, only when the trade union committee can regularly convene trade union meetings and plenary sessions to discuss important issues in the life of the trade union organization, and at the same time, create conditions for carrying out broad and comprehensive criticism and self-criticism in the process of preparing for and conducting meetings, can it fulfill its role of collective leadership.
    In some individual trade union organizations, meetings and plenary sessions are held only occasionally, and even when they are held, the number of committee members attending is very small. At this time, the plenary session and the Presidium are actually nominal and without substance, and we must never tolerate this phenomenon.
    The committee system in leadership work not only does not abolish, but also strengthens the individual's responsibility for the execution of resolutions and the work undertaken. It is not enough to merely attend the plenary sessions of the Presidium or the trade union committee. As the 14th Congress of the CPSU (B) required, the main issue is to make every elected trade union worker responsible for a defined job, and as a part of this collective, he should be responsible for it.
    Leading in a collective way means strengthening ties with the masses, frequently contacting general trade union members, keenly listening to their opinions, and relying on the experience of the masses. Comrade Stalin taught us that in order to correctly solve problems, we must combine the opinions of leaders and the masses. Only in this way can leadership be correct.

　　苏联报刊论文摘要
    工会工作中的委员制
    苏联“劳动报”五月三十日发表社论，指出在工会工作中实行集体领导的重要性，摘要如下。
    工作中的委员制，集体领导的原则，是苏联工会民主主义的最重要的特点。这一原则，完全符合于作为培养管理人材的学校和共产主义学校的工会工作的精神和内容，保证了广大群众积极参加工会的一切工作。
    工作中的委员制就是在讨论、制订和实施工会组织的措施中所实行的一种集体制度。只有依靠集体经验，只有在全体人员的积极参加下，才可能顺利完成列宁、斯大林的党为苏联工会所规定的任务。
    集体领导制是工会工作的基本方法，是培养干部的有效手段，是教育他们的真正学校。所有工会工作的实际经验都明显地证实：工会会员越积极地参加工会委员会的工作，工会领导者们越多地依靠群众的经验，工会组织的工作也就越有成效。
    对委员制原则的破坏，不可避免地将会使工作发生严重的缺点和失败。土尔克明共和国石油工人工会委员会前任主席贝尔德也夫的例子，可以作为这方面的一个借镜。贝尔德也夫同志没有觉得他是被选举到工作岗位上来工作并须向主席团负责的，他的行为像是一个坏的行政长官，盲目地相信公文和命令的力量。工会工作需要顾及全体人员的经验和意见，但他却独断独行，不吸收积极分子参加工作。这种对集体领导制原则的破坏，终于引起无人监督的现象，造成了不负责任的局面，产生了工会对财政纪律的严重破坏情况。土尔克明共和国工会委员会主席团把贝尔德也夫作为一个不能符合于工会领导者的起码条件的人，予以解职，这一处分是很正确的。
    工会的集体领导机关是工会委员会或工会理事会，它是由大会、代表会或代表大会以不记名投票方式所选举出来的。可是只有在工会委员会能定期召集工会会议和全体会议，对工会组织生活的各项重要问题进行讨论，同时并在筹备和进行会议的过程中，为开展广泛而全面的批评和自我批评创造条件，它才能完成自己的集体领导的作用。
    在一些个别的工会组织中，会议和全体会议只是偶然举行，有时就是举行，出席的委员人数也很少，这时全体会议和主席团实际上是有名无实，对于这种现象我们决不应容忍。
    领导工作中的委员制不仅不是取消、而且还要加强个人对决议的执行和所负工作的责任。仅是出席主席团或工会委员会的全体会议是不够的。正如联共（布）第十四次代表大会所要求的那样，主要的问题是在于要使每一个被选举的工会工作者担负确定的工作，他既是这一集体的一部分，便应对它负责。
    以集体的方式进行领导——就是巩固与群众的联系，经常和一般工会会员接触，锐敏地听取他们的意见和依靠群众的经验。斯大林同志教导我们说，为了正确地解决问题，必须把领导者和群众的意见结合起来，只有这样，领导才会正确。
