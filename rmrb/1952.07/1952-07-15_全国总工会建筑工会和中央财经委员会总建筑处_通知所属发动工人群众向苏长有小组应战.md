The Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Construction Workers' Union and the General Construction Office of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission jointly issued a notice, notifying subordinate organizations throughout the country to mobilize workers to challenge the Su Changyou Group. The notice is as follows:

　　The Su Changyou bricklaying group learned advanced Soviet experience in June of last year and created the segmented continuous bricklaying method, which started the reform movement of China's construction industry. This year, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, the group learned the Soviet Shafliugin's two-handed mortar squeezing method, which made bricklaying efficiency create a new national record. In order to further tap the potential of the construction industry and carry out the patriotic production increase and conservation campaign, the group formulated a production increase and conservation plan, and launched a friendly competition challenge to construction workers across the country.

　　The development of this competition movement will become the basic driving force for promoting the improvement of labor organization, tools, and operating methods in the entire construction industry. It not only breaks all conservative ideas that stick to conventions and superstitions to the old, but also has extremely important significance for construction workers to learn advanced experience and improve enterprise management, and has a huge promoting effect on the construction industry to explore potential capabilities and carry out production increase and conservation campaigns.

　　For this reason, all levels of organizations of construction enterprise administrations and construction trade unions in various localities are hereby notified that, under the leadership of the local CCP committee and the local federation of trade unions, they should first widely and systematically organize the study and publicity of advanced working methods in the construction industry, and then, on this basis, mobilize groups that have already learned advanced working methods to earnestly and extensively discuss the significance of the Su Changyou Group's challenge letter, and formulate their own practical and specific plans and competition conditions in light of the actual situation of their units. In the challenge competition, avoid all formalistic and irresponsible phenomena, and the main content of the competition must be the study and promotion of advanced working methods in the construction industry. Quality must be guaranteed in the competition. Only in this way can we further stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and meet the large-scale economic construction.

    全国总工会建筑工会和中央财经委员会总建筑处
    通知所属发动工人群众向苏长有小组应战
    中华全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会和政务院财政经济委员会总建筑处联合发出通知，通知所属全国各地的各级组织发动工人群众，向苏长有小组应战。通知如下：
    苏长有瓦工小组于去年六月学习了苏联先进经验，创造了分段连续砌砖法，掀起了中国建筑工业的改革运动。今年该小组又在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，学习了苏联沙夫留金的双手挤浆法，使砌砖效率创全国新纪录。为了更进一步地挖掘建筑工业潜在力，开展爱国主义增产节约运动，该小组制定了增产节约计划，并以此向全国建筑工人发起友谊竞赛的挑战。
    这个竞赛运动的开展，将成为推动整个建筑工业改进劳动组织，改进工具，改进操作方法上的基本动力。它不仅打破了一切墨守成规，迷信陈旧的保守思想，对于建筑业职工学习先进经验，改进企业管理有极为重要的意义，并且对于建筑工业发掘潜在能力开展增产节约运动有其巨大的推动作用。
    为此，特通知各地建筑企业行政、建筑工会的各级组织，应在当地中共党委与地方总工会的领导下，首先广泛地有计划地组织学习与宣传建筑工业先进工作方法，然后，在此基础上发动已经学习了先进工作方法的小组，认真地广泛地讨论苏长有小组挑战书的意义，结合本单位的情况，拟定自己的切实的具体计划和竞赛条件。在应战挑战竞赛中，应避免一切空具形式，不负责任的现象，必须以学习与推广建筑工业先进工作方法为竞赛的主要内容。在竞赛中必须保证质量。只有这样，才能更进一步发挥工人的积极性与创造性，为实现毛主席增产节约的号召，迎接大规模的经济建设而奋斗。
