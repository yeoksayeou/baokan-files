Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued a notice to local health administrative agencies and their affiliated medical institutions in June regarding the promotion of the painless childbirth method. The notice stated: The painless childbirth method is an example of Soviet medical workers combining Pavlov's theory with clinical practice. Recent results in some hospital obstetrics departments in our country have proven it to be effective and it has gradually attracted the attention and support of the masses. According to statistics from the obstetrics department of Shanghai Second Military Medical University Hospital since it began implementing the painless childbirth method in March of this year, among 34 parturients, those with extremely good conditions accounted for 23.4%; those with good conditions (i.e., only feeling tired after childbirth) accounted for 52.9%; those with satisfactory conditions (i.e., parturients felt slight soreness during childbirth, but did not scream in pain) accounted for 20.8%; ineffective cases accounted for 2.9%. The notice hopes that health and medical institutions at all levels will carefully study and promote it; and pay attention to the following issues in promoting this new method:

	First, it is necessary to estimate that ideological resistance and some technical difficulties will inevitably be encountered in promoting this new method. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education on revolutionary humanitarianism and fraternity among employees, and enlighten them to abandon outdated idealistic medical viewpoints and bravely accept new things. The application of this new therapy is not only a technical reform, but also can improve the relationship between medical staff and patients through cordial and considerate publicity and education, and establish a good relationship of "medical staff being responsible and sympathetic to patients, and patients trusting and respecting medical staff"; second, health administrative organs in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should organize medical staff, especially obstetricians, to study relevant documents on painless childbirth, and focus on designating hospital obstetrics and gynecology departments to adhere to the adoption of this new method, absorb experience, and then gradually promote it to midwives at all levels; third, local health personnel, mass organizations, and health medical journals should widely publicize Soviet and Chinese theories and clinical reports on painless childbirth. Medical institutions that adopt this new method should promptly statistically summarize their methods, effects, experience, and creations, and report them to higher-level health authorities, and publish them in publications.

    卫生部发出关于推行无痛分娩法的通知
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府卫生部在六月间对各地卫生行政机构及其所属医疗机构发出关于推行无痛分娩法的通知。通知中说：无痛分娩法是苏联医务工作者根据巴甫洛夫学说与临床实际情形相结合的范例。近来在我国某些医院产妇科施行结果，证明效果良好，已逐渐引起群众的注意和拥护。据上海军医大学医院产妇科自今年三月间开始实行无痛分娩法以来的统计，三十四个产妇中情况极好的占百分之二十三点四；情况良好的（即产后只感到疲乏的）占百分之五十二点九；情况尚好的
    （即产妇在分娩时微有酸痛，但没有喊叫痛苦）占百分之二十点八；无效占百分之二点九。通知希望各级卫生医疗机构细心研究和推行；并在推行这一新方法中注意下列几个问题：
    第一，要估计在推行这一新方法中必然会碰到思想上的抵触和技术上的一些困难，因此必须在员工中进行革命的人道主义与友爱精神的教育，启发他们抛弃陈旧的唯心的医学观点，勇于接受新鲜事物。这一新疗法的应用，不仅是技术上的改革，而且在进行亲切的体贴的宣传教育中可以改善医务人员与病人之间的关系，建立“医务人员对病员负责同情，病人对医务人员相信与尊重”的良好关系；第二，各大行政区、省、市卫生行政机关应组织医务人员，首先是产妇科的医务工作者学习有关无痛分娩法的文件，有重点地指定医院妇产科坚持采用这一新方法，吸取经验再逐渐向各级助产士推广；第三，各地卫生人员、群众团体和卫生医学杂志应广泛宣传苏联和我国关于无痛分娩法的理论及临床报告。采用这一新方法的医疗机构，应将方法、效果、经验与创造，及时统计、总结，呈报上级卫生机关，并在刊物上发表。
