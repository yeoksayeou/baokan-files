    Japanese People Resist Fascist Law

    The so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," concocted by the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan under the instructions of its American masters, was reluctantly passed in the upper and lower houses of the Diet on July 3rd and 4th. Kimura Tokutaro, the Justice Minister of the Yoshida government, recently announced that this fascist law would "take effect" on July 21st. The Yoshida government attempts to use this reactionary law as a "legal basis" to intensify its oppression of the Japanese people, led by the Japanese Communist Party, in order to consolidate its reactionary rule.

    However, the US-Japan reactionaries are getting the opposite result. Even before the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" was submitted to the Diet, the Japanese people launched a vigorous protest movement. In the two months from April 12th to June 20th, the Japanese working masses held five consecutive large-scale strikes aimed at opposing the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law."

    Under the influence of the powerful mass movement, the vast majority of opposition parties in both houses of the Japanese Diet also opposed this bill. Therefore, the passage of this bill will not strengthen the reactionary ruling foundation of the Yoshida government, but will inevitably make it more isolated and will inevitably be met with more widespread opposition from all strata of the Japanese people.

    The US-Japan reactionaries are stepping up their efforts to destroy the peaceful life of the Japanese people and are trying to lead Japan down the road to ruin. But the Japanese people cannot allow these robbers and traitors to destroy and ravage their motherland. Now the Japanese people are responding to the call of the Japanese Communist Party and are persisting in the struggle to resist and abolish this fascist law. This just struggle of the Japanese people will continue to be supported by peace-loving people all over the world and will achieve final victory.

    日本人民反抗法西斯法案
    日本吉田反动政府遵照其美国主子的指令而制订的所谓“防止破坏活动法案”，于七月三日和四日先后在国会参众两院勉强通过。吉田政府法务总裁木村笃太郎最近并宣布这一法西斯法案定于七月二十一日“生效”。吉田政府企图利用这个反动法案作为“法律根据”，变本加厉地压迫以日本共产党为首的日本人民，以巩固它的反动统治。
    但是，美日反动派所得到的却是相反的结果。当“防止破坏活动法案”还没有提交国会时，日本人民就展开了如火如荼的抗议运动。从四月十二日到六月二十日的两个多月中，日本工人群众接连举行了五次声势浩大的、以反对“防止破坏活动法案”为目的的大罢工。
    在强大的群众运动影响下，日本参众两院绝大多数的在野党派也反对这个法案。因此这个法案的通过，并不能使吉田政府的反动统治基础得以加强，必将使它更陷于孤立的境地，必将遭到日本各阶层人民更为广泛的反对。
    美日反动派正在加紧破坏日本人民的和平生活，并企图把日本引向毁灭的道路上去。但是日本人民是不能让这些强盗和卖国贼来破坏和蹂躏自己的祖国的。现在日本人民正响应日本共产党的号召，为反抗和废除这个法西斯法案而坚持斗争。日本人民的这个正义斗争，必将继续得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持，并取得最后的胜利。
