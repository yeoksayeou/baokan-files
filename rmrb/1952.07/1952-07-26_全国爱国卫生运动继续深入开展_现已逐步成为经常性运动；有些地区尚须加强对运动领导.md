    The National Patriotic Health Campaign Continues to Deepen
    Now Gradually Becoming a Regular Movement; Some Regions Still Need to Strengthen Leadership of the Movement
    [This newspaper reports] The national patriotic health campaign is continuing to deepen across the country, and is being promoted from cities to the vast rural areas, forming a mass and regular movement.
    In the North China region, the patriotic health campaign has spread to the vast rural areas. In general towns and villages of Hebei Province, one to three mass clean-up campaigns have been carried out, making previously dirty places very clean. In Handan Town and along the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway, more than 80 percent of the areas have undergone thorough cleaning. Various cities and towns transport the cleared garbage to the outside of the city for farmers to use as fertilizer. Many food vendors in cities and towns have installed sanitary equipment. Tianjin held a city-wide fly and mosquito extermination inspection on July 14th, promoting sanitation work in backward areas and blank spots. Farmers in Hejiao Village, Fifth District, Guyang County, Suiyuan Province, not only improved environmental sanitation, but also paid attention to household and personal hygiene, with some farmers even buying toothbrushes to brush their teeth. The sanitation work in Pingyuan Province has gradually become regularized, with 5,168 administrative villages establishing cultural and health committees; many natural villages have also established health workers. All areas under the jurisdiction of Ye County and Qingping County have established cultural and health committees.
    The patriotic health campaign in the Northeast region is gradually deepening and becoming regular. Liaoxi Province, and others, have put forward the slogan of "universal and comprehensive, in-depth and thorough, and maintaining regularity." In many towns and villages throughout the region, people have formulated patriotic health covenants or incorporated cleaning and sanitation activities into patriotic covenants; some cities, counties, and villages have also implemented "People's Sanitation Day." In some areas, the masses spontaneously launched challenges, red flag competitions, and implemented evaluation, commendation, and criticism systems. Many factories and villages in Shenyang and other places have also created good examples of combining the patriotic health campaign with production, breaking the erroneous thinking of some cadres who emphasized "busy production" and "no time," and completely separated production tasks from sanitation work. Shenyang Woolen Mill initially listed the patriotic health campaign as one of the three central tasks (the other two tasks being the "Three Antis" campaign and "production"), led personally by the deputy director of the factory. In various meetings within the factory, sanitation work and production tasks were arranged, inspected, and summarized together. The health of the factory's employees has improved, and the production tasks for the first half of the year were completed six days ahead of schedule, exceeding the task by 0.66 percent. In Shihuogou South Village and Dongmenwai Village in Kuandian County, and Defa Village in Yian County, etc., because the leadership attached importance to it, combined propaganda with the vital interests of production and farmers, and paid attention to giving full play to the power of women, children, and the elderly, and closely monitored inspections, paying attention to correcting the slackers, the appearance of the village was completely renewed. Every courtyard in Shihuogou South Village and Dongmenwai Village has become so bright and refreshing, and almost every household has exterminated flies. The elderly farmers all happily said: "I have never heard that there can be no flies since ancient times, but now there really are none, and it is comfortable to sleep!" These facts provide a strong affirmative answer to whether rural areas can pay attention to environmental sanitation.
    The patriotic health campaign in the entire East China region has become a mass movement under leadership. In order to promote this movement, various places have widely and deeply carried out propaganda and education on hygiene knowledge combined with patriotic ideology. The entire region has compiled and printed 1,014,125 copies of hygiene propaganda booklets and a large number of slogans, propaganda posters, lantern slides, and other propaganda materials; Party reporters and propagandists in various places have generally been dispatched, and scientists, medical workers, teachers, and students have been mobilized to form propaganda forces. In its propaganda, Nanjing particularly paid attention to using the methods of "propaganda on one hand, action on the other" and "propaganda on one hand, inspection on the other," so that 90 percent of the city's population received education on the patriotic health campaign. After such widespread and in-depth propaganda, the broad masses actively participated in the movement. In Qingdao and Ningbo alone, more than 90 percent of the population participated in the movement, and in Fuzhou, the masses participating in the cleanup and rat catching reached more than 95 percent of the city's adult population. Many places launched competitions between units, villages, and groups, promoting the rapid development of the movement. As of July 16th, according to incomplete statistics, the entire region cleared 118.88 million dan of garbage; dredged more than 516,000 ditches (places), totaling more than 6.84 million meters; built more than 427,000 toilets; caught 21 million rats; eradicated 1.478 million jin of flies and maggots, and more than 253 million flies; and exterminated 19,100 jin of mosquitoes, and more than 128 million mosquitoes. At present, the environmental sanitation of the broad masses of the people in the entire region has greatly improved. Many people in various places have signed patriotic health covenants to consolidate their achievements. For example, 90 percent of the residents of Hefei have signed patriotic health covenants. The patriotic health campaign in the East China region is closely integrated with municipal construction work in cities. For example, during this movement, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau added 160 water supply stations, bringing the total to 1,279, solving the drinking water problem for more than 60 percent of the city's working people. Many small and medium-sized towns have also repaired streets in conjunction with the movement. In factories, it is closely combined with production, safety and hygiene work, and employee welfare work. Shanghai Yong'an No. 1 Factory cleared out more than 50 million yuan worth of twisting spools, yarn spools, etc., wiped various machines, and extended the life of the machines. Many factories have begun to pay attention to summer workshop temperature regulation and public health equipment such as kitchens, bathrooms, and toilets. In rural areas, it is also combined with the production increase competition movement. Many rural areas use the cleared garbage to accumulate fertilizer. Huawan Township, Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, cleared 67,000 jin of garbage and burned it into 26,000 jin of coked mud ash, increasing a large amount of fertilizer. As the masses in Laiyang, Shandong said: "The broom sounds, the manure pile grows, production increase and hygiene are both equal."
    The patriotic health campaigns in major and medium-sized cities in the Central South region have penetrated into neighborhoods and suburbs, and some backward areas have also changed their appearance. More than 80 percent of households in Guangzhou have met cleanliness standards. Wuhan has also broken through backward areas and blank spots in the movement. For example, dozens of tons of garbage were piled on an open space in the Fifth District. No one paid attention to it at the beginning of the movement, but now the masses have spontaneously organized to clear the garbage in five days, and have also organized the open space into a square, installed street lights and built a stage on it, making it a place for cultural entertainment. The countryside has also taken on a new look; many villages have been cleaned up spotlessly; corners that many farmers had not touched in decades have been thoroughly cleaned this time. For example, Taiping, Nanyuan, and Fenglin townships in the Third District of Chongyi County, Jiangxi Province, not only cleared weeds and manure, and filled in dirty water ditches, but also built new pig pens and cattle pens; everyone has developed good hygiene habits of sweeping diligently, washing diligently, and changing clothes frequently. Some districts and townships in Yunfu County, Guangdong Province, combined with land reform and carried out vigorous publicity, which achieved good results. After the education of the patriotic health campaign, a new moral atmosphere of paying attention to cleanliness and caring for public health has been universally established in rural areas. Jiang Zaiqiu mutual aid group in Quan County, Guangxi Province, and Peng Guangxian mutual aid group in Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province, which are well-known in the Central South region, have also challenged farmers across the province to see who can do a better job in hygiene.
    After large-scale publicity in the Northwest and Southwest regions, the hygiene movement has gradually advanced from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. Most areas in the Northwest have established basic-level hygiene organizations. The Secretary of the County Party Committee and the County Mayor of Xuyong County, Southern Sichuan District, personally led this movement. In 20 days, they swept out a total of more than 750,000 jin of garbage and accumulated manure in the urban area and transported it to the countryside as fertilizer. Some employees of a certain unit of Chongqing Sichuan Cement Plant used their spare time to improve environmental sanitation, and were vaccinated, and formulated cleanliness and hygiene regulations, which greatly reduced the number of employees on sick leave, ensuring the smooth progress of production.
    However, the development of the movement is uneven, especially the hygiene work of government agencies, schools, and factories in many cities is still behind the masses. Some leaders and cadres in some regions and units do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of the hygiene movement, unilaterally emphasize production, and juxtapose the patriotic hygiene movement against production, or adopt a perfunctory attitude; some do not regard the patriotic hygiene movement as a long-term task, and have a temporary and hasty view, tense for a while, then slack off, thus affecting the development of the movement. These biases must be corrected quickly.

    全国爱国卫生运动继续深入开展
    现已逐步成为经常性运动；有些地区尚须加强对运动领导
    【本报讯】全国各地爱国卫生运动正在继续深入地开展，并由城市推向广大农村，形成群众性和经常性的运动。
    华北区的爱国卫生运动已向广大农村开展。河北省各地的一般城镇和农村，都进行了一次到三次群众性的清洁大扫除，把过去很脏的地方打扫得很干净。邯郸镇和京山铁路沿线，百分之八十以上的地区都进行了彻底的清扫。各市、镇并将清除的垃圾运到城外给农民作肥料。许多市、镇的食品摊贩都已装置了卫生设备。天津市在七月十四日举行了全市性的灭蝇、灭蚊大检查，推动了落后区和空白点的卫生工作。绥远省固阳县五区合窖村的农民不仅改善了环境卫生，并注意了家庭和个人卫生，有的农民还买了牙刷刷牙。平原省的卫生工作已逐渐走向经常化，五千一百六十八个行政村建立起文教卫生委员会；不少的自然村也设立了卫生委员。邺县、清平两县所属地区已全部建立了文教卫生委员会。
    东北区爱国卫生运动，正逐步走向深入和经常化。辽西省等提出了“普遍全面，深入彻底，保持经常”的口号。全区不少城镇和农村群众订立了爱国卫生公约或把清洁卫生活动订入爱国公约；部分市县和农村还实行了“人民卫生日”。有些地区群众自动展开挑战、红旗竞赛和实行了评比表扬批评制度。沈阳市等不少工厂、农村还创造了爱国卫生运动和生产结合的良好范例，打破了部分干部强调“生产忙”、“没有时间”，把生产任务和卫生工作截然对立起来的错误思想。沈阳毛织厂，一开始即将爱国卫生运动列为三大中心任务（其余两任务为“三反”和“生产”）之一，由副厂长亲自领导，在厂内各种会议上，把卫生工作和生产任务一同布置，一同检查与总结。该厂职工健康得到改进，上半年生产任务也提前六天完成，还超过任务百分之零点六六。宽甸县石湖沟南村和东门外村、依安县德发村等，因为领导重视，结合生产和农民的切身利益进行宣传，并注意发挥妇女、儿童和老年人的力量，并抓紧检查，注意纠正松劲户，结果村中面貌为之一新。石湖沟南村和东门外村，每个院落都变得那么敞亮和清爽，几乎每户都灭绝了苍蝇。老年农民们都愉快地说：“从古就没听说能没有苍蝇，现在真没有了，睡觉也舒服！”这些事实，都对农村能否讲环境卫生，作了有力的肯定的回答。
    华东全区的爱国卫生运动已成为有领导的群众性的运动。为了推动这一运动，各地广泛深入地进行了卫生常识结合爱国主义思想的宣传教育工作。全区编印了卫生宣传小册子一百零一万四千一百二十五册和大批的标语、宣传画、幻灯片等宣传品；各地党的报告员、宣传员普遍出动，并发动科学工作者、医务工作者、教师和学生等组成宣传大军。南京市在宣传中特别注意运用了“一面宣传、一面行动”与“一面宣传、一面检查”的办法，使全市百分之九十的人受到爱国卫生运动的教育。经过这样广泛深入的宣传，广大群众积极投入到运动中来，仅青岛、宁波二市就有百分之九十以上的人口投入运动，福州市参加大扫除和捕鼠的群众达全市成年人口的百分之九十五以上。许多地方展开单位与单位、村与村、组与组之间的竞赛，推动了运动的迅速发展。截至七月十六日止，据不完全统计，全区清除垃圾一亿一千八百八十万担；疏通沟渠五十一万六千多条（处），又六百八十四万多公尺；修建厕所四十二万七千多所；捕鼠二千一百万只；扑蝇灭蛆一百四十七万八千多斤，又二亿五千三百多万只；灭蚊一万九千一百多斤，又一亿二千八百多万只。目前，全区广大人民的环境卫生有了很大的改善。许多地方的群众，都纷纷订立爱国卫生公约，把成绩巩固下来。如合肥市即有百分之九十的居民订立了爱国卫生公约。华东区爱国卫生运动，在城市是密切与市政建设工作相结合的。如上海市公用局在这一运动期间，增设了一百六十个给水站，连以前共计为一千二百七十九个，使全市百分之六十以上劳动人民的饮水问题得到解决。许多中小城镇也都结合运动修铺了街道。在工厂是密切结合生产、安全卫生工作及职工福利工作的。上海永安一厂清除出价值五千多万元的撚线筒管、纱管等物，揩擦了各种机器，延长了机器的寿命。不少工厂已开始注意到夏季车间温度调节以及厨房、浴室、厕所等公共卫生设备问题。在农村中也是与增产竞赛运动相结合的。许多农村利用清除的垃圾来积肥，浙江临安县花畹乡清除垃圾六万七千斤，烧成焦泥灰二万六千斤，增加了大量肥料。正如山东莱阳群众所说：“扫帚响，粪堆长，增产卫生两相当”。
    中南区各大、中城市的爱国卫生运动，已深入到里弄和郊区，部分落后地区也改变了面貌。广州市百分之八十以上的住户达到了清洁标准。武汉市并破突了运动中的落后区和空白点。如第五区一块空地上堆着几十吨的垃圾，在运动初期没有人理会，现在群众自动地组织起来，用五天的时间把垃圾清除了，并且还把这块空地整理成为广场，在上面装了路灯、砌了戏台，使它成为文化娱乐的场所。农村也出现了新的面貌；许多村子都打扫得干干净净；许多农民家中几十年没有触动过的角落，这一次也彻底进行了打扫。例如江西崇义县三区太平、南源、枫林三乡不仅清除了野草、粪污，填平了脏水沟，还新建了猪栏、牛栏；每一个人都养成了勤扫、勤洗、勤换的良好卫生习惯。广东云浮县部分区乡并结合土地改革，大力进行宣传，收到良好的效果。经过爱国卫生运动的教育以后，农村中普遍树立起讲究清洁、关心公共卫生的新的道德风气。闻名中南区的广西全县蒋在球互助组和江西萍乡彭光贤互助组，还向全省农民提出挑战，看谁的卫生工作做得好。
    西北、西南地区经过大规模的宣传以后，卫生运动，已由大城市逐步向中小城市和农村推进。西北不少地区大部都建立了卫生基层组织。川南区叙永县中共县委书记和县长亲自领导这一运动，二十天内在城区扫出垃圾和积粪共七十五万多斤，运送到乡下作了肥料。重庆四川水泥厂某所职工，利用工余时间搞好了环境卫生，并注射了防疫针，订出清洁卫生等制度，请病假的职工因而大大减少，保证了生产的顺利进行。
    但是，运动的发展是不平衡的，特别是许多城市的机关、学校、工厂的卫生工作还落在群众的后面。有些地区和单位的领导干部对卫生运动的重要性认识不足，片面地强调生产，把爱国卫生运动和生产对立起来，或采取敷衍塞责的态度；有的不把爱国卫生运动当作一件长期的工作，有着临时突击的观点，紧张一时，便松了劲，因而影响了运动的开展。这些偏向是必须迅速纠正的。
