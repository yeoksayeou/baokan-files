    ——The Model Deeds of Yang Zhenru, a High-Yield Rice Expert from Dachenzhuang, Ninghe County, Hebei Province
    By Qin Zheng, Ma Keming, Xu Tiankai, Wang Yutang
    (XIII) Early plowing and deep plowing with skillful application of manure, digging the soil six inches deep with an iron spade, using 120 catties of bean cake per mu as base fertilizer, and then topdressing with 80 catties during the seedling stage. Good coordination of land and fertilizer ensures strong and even growth of the seedlings. Reasonable irrigation is crucial, understanding the habits of the crops is most important!
    (XIV) Old Yang has a good democratic style, evaluating work and recording points conscientiously, taking both quantity and quality into account, with each work point worth ten catties of rice. Yang Zhenliang is highly efficient in irrigating, one person can do the work of two, everyone evaluates him at sixteen points, and he grins widely.
    (XV) The green rice plants are half a person tall, with long, full ears of grain. Just when people are talking about the harvest, swarms of locusts rise up and cover the sky and earth, what can be done!
    (XVI) Fight! Fight! The great army to eliminate locusts is mobilized, village connected to village, people connected to people. Killing one locust is like eliminating one American soldier! Two thousand catties were caught in three days, but the situation is still very serious.
    (XVII) Chairman Mao is always concerned about the people, and sent planes to exterminate the locusts. Eighty-eight-year-old Grandpa Yang squeezed into the crowd: "Thank Chairman Mao! Thank Chairman Mao! Work hard to repay the motherland, children!"
    (XVIII) The locusts are wiped out, the bumper harvest is guaranteed, and the people of Dachenzhuang shout out a call: "Protect our good times!" Donate airplanes and cannons to support our Volunteer Army and eliminate the evil American aggressors!

    走向幸福的生活
    ——河北省宁河县大陈庄水稻丰产能手杨振儒的模范事迹

    （十三）早耕深耕巧施粪，铁锨掘地六寸深，每亩一二○斤豆饼作基肥，发秧期再追八十斤。地力和肥力配合好，苗儿强壮长得匀。放水灌溉要合理，摸准庄稼的脾气最要紧！
    （十四）老杨民主作风好，评工记分认真搞，数量质量都顾到，每工十分十斤稻。杨振良放水效率高，一人赛过俩人搞，大家评他十六分，裂开大嘴嘻嘻笑。
    （十五）绿油油稻棵半人高，长长穗头粒儿饱。人们正在谈论着丰收的时候，漫天遍地的蝗虫起来了，这可怎么好！
    （十六）打呀！打呀！灭蝗的大军齐出动，村连着村呀，人连着人。打死一个蝗虫，就是消灭一个美国兵！三天捉到了两千斤，情况仍然很严重。
    （十七）毛主席时时关心着人民，派来了飞机灭蝗虫。八十八岁的杨大爷挤进了人群：“感谢毛主席！感谢毛主席！好好地报效祖国吧，孩子们！”
    （十八）蝗虫消灭干净，丰收有了保证，大陈庄的人民喊出一个呼声：“保住咱们的好光景！”捐献飞机大炮支援咱志愿军，消灭万恶的美国侵略兵！
