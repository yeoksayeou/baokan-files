Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 14th: London dispatch: The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, who visited China for seven weeks, has recently returned home. On July 8th, Johnson held a press conference in London, exposing and condemning the crimes of the U.S. military in waging germ warfare in Korea and China. The facts provided by Johnson have aroused widespread attention among the British people, and consequently, greatly alarmed the British ruling group, which is trying its best to whitewash the U.S. germ warfare criminals.

Unable to erase the significant impact of Johnson's accusations, the British ruling group had to change its past tactic of simply blocking news and instructed various newspapers to publish a large number of slanderous news and commentaries, desperately slandering Johnson. These newspapers deliberately omitted the joint letter of protest given to Dean Johnson by Chinese Catholic and Christian leaders; refused to publish the confessions of captured U.S. Air Force personnel Inak and Quinn regarding the dropping of germ bombs. While suppressing the various ironclad evidence of U.S. germ warfare presented by Johnson, they falsely accused Johnson's accusations of being "without evidence."

The British ruling group is also planning further persecution of Johnson. Thirty-eight Conservative Members of Parliament in the House of Commons have jointly requested Queen Elizabeth to remove Johnson from his lifelong position as Dean of Canterbury. Conservative MP Ward also proposed to try Johnson for treason. The Churchill cabinet has also discussed how to stop Johnson from exposing U.S. germ warfare crimes.

However, all these slanders and threats cannot stop the 78-year-old Dean Johnson from fighting for peace. On July 10th, he issued a statement in response to the slanders of the British bourgeois newspapers. He rebuked these newspapers, saying: "They deliberately suppressed the most powerful evidence I brought back—the declaration signed by the leaders of five million Christians and Catholics in China condemning this most inhumane form of warfare. This declaration is the best evidence, showing that it is not only the Communists who are accusing the United States of waging germ warfare." On the 11th, the old Dean met with reporters again, once again denouncing the crime of the U.S. in using bacteriological weapons. He accused British newspapers of deliberately not publishing the confessions of Inak and Quinn, and said: "I believe that our British Church will soon believe the facts of germ warfare and will demand the prohibition of this weapon of mass slaughter." Johnson told the British people: As long as they have courage and determination, they can stop germ warfare. He said: "We have many well-meaning ordinary people in front of us who seem to have closed their eyes and plugged their ears because they cannot bear to face the reality of germ warfare. But we must get the people concerned to show courage and determination, which is not only our responsibility, but also very necessary to protect mankind."

Dean Johnson also announced that he is writing a pamphlet on U.S. germ warfare, entitled "I Accuse." He also plans to give speeches at rallies throughout Britain to expose the crimes of the U.S. military in public. On the 16th, he will give his first report on his visit to China at a gathering hosted by the Britain-China Friendship Association.

The London "Daily Worker" commented on the slander and persecution of Dean Johnson, saying: British bourgeois newspapers are trying their best to divert the attention of the British people. They are willing to launch an American-style persecution campaign to attack Dean Johnson. The British newspapers are doing this because "Dean Johnson, after studying the evidence of germ warfare presented by Chinese scientists, dared to announce that he believed they were telling the truth." The "Daily Worker" finally warned: "Before the government, the Archbishop, or anyone else accepts the views of the British newspapers, it is hoped that they remember: The British people hate the American overlords and will never tolerate making pastors or priests as sacrifices to please them."

    约翰逊揭发美国细菌战的罪行
    英国统治集团大感恐慌竭力进行诽谤和威胁
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】伦敦消息：在中国访问了七个星期的英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊已于最近回国。七月八日，约翰逊在伦敦举行记者招待会，揭露并控诉了美国军队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。约翰逊所提供的事实引起了英国广大人民的普遍重视，因而也使竭力为美国细菌战犯装点门面的英国统治集团大感恐慌。
    英国统治集团无法抹煞约翰逊的控诉所造成的重大影响，因此不得不改变以往单纯封锁新闻的故技而指使各报发表大量诬蔑性的新闻与评论，竭力诽谤约翰逊。这些报纸故意不提中国天主教和基督教领袖们交给约翰逊教长的联名抗议信；拒不刊登被俘的美国空军人员伊纳克和奎恩关于投掷细菌弹的供词。它们一面扣压约翰逊所提出的美国进行细菌战的各种铁证，一面却诬蔑约翰逊的控诉“没有证据”。
    英国统治集团也正在策划对约翰逊的进一步的迫害。下院三十八名保守党议员已联名请求伊丽莎白女王解除约翰逊的坎特伯雷教长的终身职务。保守党议员渥德并且提议以叛国罪来审讯约翰逊。邱吉尔内阁也已讨论了如何制止约翰逊揭发美国进行细菌战罪行的问题。
    但是所有这些诽谤与威胁都不能阻止七十八岁的约翰逊教长为和平而斗争。七月十日，他发表了答复英国资产阶级报纸诬蔑的声明。他斥责这些报纸说：“它们故意扣压我带回来的最有力的证据——中国五百万基督教和天主教教徒的领袖们所签署的谴责这种最不人道的战争方式的宣言。这篇宣言是一个最好的证据，它说明控诉细菌战的不仅是共产党人。”十一日，老教长又接见记者，再度痛斥美国使用细菌武器的罪行。他指责英国报纸故意不发表伊纳克和奎恩的供词，并且说：“我相信我们英国教会不久也会相信细菌战的事实并且将要求禁止这种大规模屠杀的武器。”约翰逊告诉英国人民：只要他们有勇气和决心，他们就可以制止细菌战争。他说：“我们面前有许多好心肠的普通人民，他们似乎已经闭上了眼睛，并且用手指堵住了耳朵，因为他们不忍面对细菌战的现实。但是我们必须使有关的人们拿出勇气和决心来，这不仅是我们的责任，为了保护人类，这样做也是非常必要的。”
    约翰逊教长还宣布，他正在写一本关于美国细菌战的小册子，题目叫做“我控诉”。他还准备在英国全国各地的集会上发表演说，以便在公众面前揭露美国军队的罪行。十六日，他将在英中友好协会主持的集会上作第一个访华报告。
    伦敦“工人日报”评论对约翰逊教长的诽谤与迫害说：英国资产阶级报纸竭力想转移英国人民的视线。它们不惜发动一个美国式的迫害运动，来攻击约翰逊教长。英国报纸之所以这样做，是因为“约翰逊教长在研究了中国科学家提出的关于细菌战的证据之后，敢于宣布他相信他们讲的是真理。”“工人日报”最后提出警告说：“在政府、大主教或任何其他人接受英国报纸的意见之前，希望他们记住：英国人民痛恨美国太上皇，决不容忍把教徒或牧师当做牺牲品来取悦他们。”
