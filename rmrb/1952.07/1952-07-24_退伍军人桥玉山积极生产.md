    Veteran Qiao Yushan Actively Engages in Production
    Editor: I am a veteran, now forty-two years old. I joined the Eighth Route Army in 1937 and was seriously wounded several times during the War of Resistance Against Japan. I was discharged in 1945. After being discharged, I participated in land reform in Xialiang Village, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi, and was allocated land, housing, farm tools, and means of production.

    At first, I had a wrong idea, feeling proud of my past achievements, thinking I was superior to ordinary farmers and cadres, and unwilling to join a mutual aid team. Farming alone, I was too busy, and the grain I harvested was very little, barely enough to maintain a living. I lived like this for two years. The masses dared not approach me, and I was uneasy day and night. Finally, I realized my problem and resolved to start from scratch and restore the honor of a revolutionary soldier.

    In the spring of 1949, I asked Li Changhai, the labor model of our village, to let me join his mutual aid team. He said he would consider it. I waited at home, afraid that I would not be approved. Later, he notified me to participate in the mutual aid team's discussion of the spring production plan. From then on, I felt like a big stone had been removed from my body, and I was extremely happy. I used practical actions to show everyone that I would definitely change my style and work hard for mutual aid production. Over the past three years, I have corrected my shortcomings, improved my relationship with the masses, and learned a lot of farming techniques. My grain harvest has increased, and my life has greatly improved. I have gotten married and have a chubby baby. Now the masses have composed a ballad for me: "Old Qiao used to have many difficulties, but now his life has improved a lot. There are many benefits to mutual aid, improving technology to harvest more grain..."

    退伍军人桥玉山积极生产
    编辑同志：我是个退伍军人，现年四十二岁。我在一九三七年参加八路军，在抗日战争中身负几次重伤，到一九四五年退伍。退伍以后，我在山西襄垣县下良村参加了土地改革，分到了土地、房屋、农具和生产资料。
    开头，我有一种错误思想，居功自傲，觉得比一般农民、干部都高一等，不愿参加互助组。我一人种地，忙不过来，收的粮食很少，只能勉强维持生活。我这样过了两年，群众不敢接近我，我也日夜不安。最后我到底看出了自己的毛病，下决心从头作起，恢复革命军人的荣誉。
    一九四九年春，我要求本村劳动模范李昌孩让我加入他的互助组，他说考虑考虑。我等在家里，怕不能批准。以后，他通知我参加互助组讨论春季生产计划。从此以后，我像搬掉身上一块大石头，愉快极了。我用实际行动向大家表示，一定改变作风，努力互助生产。三年来，我改正了毛病，改善了和群众的关系，学得了不少的耕作技术。我的粮食收多了，生活大大提高了。我已经结了婚，生了个胖娃娃。现在群众替我编了一段快板：“过去老桥困难多，现在生活改善多。互助起来好处多，提高技术打粮多……”
