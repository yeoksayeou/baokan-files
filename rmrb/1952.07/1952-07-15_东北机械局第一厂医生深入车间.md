    Doctors from the First Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau Go Deep into Workshops

    Editor: In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the clinic of the First Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau initially only focused on saving gauze and bandages, so the results were not good. Later, after everyone's research, brainstorming, and finding tricks, they came up with the working method of "going to the workshops." Doctors went to the workshops on rounds to see patients on time. For those who needed injections, the doctor first prescribed a prescription, and then they went to the injection station for the injection. In order to save patients' time for getting medicine, a "collaborative prescription system" was formulated, with close contact between doctors and the pharmacy. The pharmacy prepared the medicine first and gave it to the doctor to bring along, and distributed it to the patients at any time. After this reform, according to preliminary statistics, more than one hundred hours of consultation time can be saved every day, equivalent to 3.03 tons of grain, and it is estimated that 540 tons of grain can be saved in half a year. Forty-four hours of medicine collection time can be saved every day, and 239.8 tons of grain can be saved in half a year. A total of 780 tons of grain can be produced in the second half of this year.

    Through this work, we have gained a more specific understanding of the workers' illnesses and the workshop's sanitation facilities, and strengthened preventive work. The workers' highly conscious labor attitude has also greatly encouraged our work enthusiasm. In the future, we will resolutely do our job well.

    东北机械局第一厂医生深入车间
    编辑同志：东北机械局第一厂医务所在增产节约运动中，起先只注意到节省纱布和绷带，因此成绩并不好。后来经过大家的研究，动脑筋、找窍门，想到了“到车间去”的工作办法。大夫按时到车间巡回替病人看病。需要注射的，先由大夫处方，再到注射站注射。为了节省病人的取药时间，制定了“协同处方制度”，由大夫和药房取得密切联系，先由药房把药配好，交给医生带去，随时发给病人。经过这一改革以后，据初步统计，诊疗时间每天可节省一百小时以上，折合粮食三点零三吨，预计半年可省粮食五百四十吨。取药时间每天可节省四十四小时，半年可节省粮食二百三十九点八吨，今年下半年总共可增产粮食七百八十吨。
    通过这一工作，我们更具体了解了工人们的患病情况和车间卫生设备情况，加强了预防工作。而工人同志们高度自觉的劳动态度，也大大鼓舞了我们的工作热情。今后，我们坚决要把工作做好。
