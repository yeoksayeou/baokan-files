Xinhua News Agency, Yangzhou, July 24th: The Zahe Sluice Gate, Zahe Ship Lock, and Luoma Lake Flood Discharge Sluice Gate, constructed as part of the Subei Yi River Harnessing Project, officially began discharging water for navigation in early July.

The Zahe Sluice Gate and Zahe Ship Lock are located on the Grand Canal near Zahe Town, Suqian County, Subei. The Luoma Lake Flood Discharge Sluice Gate is built on the Yanghe Beach where the upper reaches of the Subei Zongliutang River connect to Luoma Lake. The construction of these three projects began last winter, involving more than 30,000 laborers and technicians.

The Zahe Sluice Gate and the Luoma Lake Flood Discharge Sluice Gate can effectively control the flow of the Grand Canal during the flood season and enable the Zongliutang River to play a role in drainage, ensuring the safety of the people along the Grand Canal during the flood season. During the dry season, they can also control the water volume in the upper reaches of the Grand Canal. Coupled with the water level regulation of the Zahe Ship Lock, this fundamentally changes the situation of the canal, which was characterized by "dyke breaches and disasters during the flood season, and no water for navigation during the dry season." Now, the canal, which had been abandoned for nearly a century, can accommodate large ships of 900 tons for year-round navigation.

The Zahe Sluice Gate, Zahe Ship Lock, and Luoma Lake Flood Discharge Sluice Gate have created favorable conditions for the people of Subei to develop urban and rural material exchanges. Now, ships are shuttling back and forth on the canal, transporting materials to various places day and night. The sorghum, corn, soybeans, and cotton along the canal are growing very lushly, and the farmers are extremely happy, striving for a great harvest in the autumn. Yang Qinggui's mutual aid team in Pixui County, a national model for sweet potato production, harvested more than 310 catties of wheat per mu this year, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Now they are intensifying weeding and fertilizing autumn crops in an effort to produce 8,000 catties of sweet potatoes and 400 catties of sorghum per mu.

    苏北皂河节制闸等放水通航
    【新华社扬州二十四日电】苏北导治沂河工程中修成的皂河节制闸、皂河船闸和骆马湖泄水闸，已在七月初旬正式放水通航。
    皂河节制闸和皂河船闸在苏北宿迁县境皂河镇附近中运河上。骆马湖泄水闸修建在苏北总六塘河上游和骆马湖相接的杨河滩上。这三个工程都是在去年冬天开始的，参加修建的民工和技术工人达三万多人。
    皂河节制闸和骆马湖泄水闸可以在汛期内有效地控制中运河流量，并可使总六塘河发挥排涝作用，保障了中运河沿岸人民汛期安全；在枯水期内，又可控制中运河上游水量；加上皂河船闸对水位的调节，就基本上改变了运河“洪水期决堤成灾，枯水期无水通航”的情况，使废弃了近百年的运河，能容载重九百吨的大轮船全年通航。
    皂河节制闸、皂河船闸和骆马湖泄水闸，为苏北人民创造了开展城乡物资交流的良好条件，现在运河的船只正穿梭河上，终日络绎不绝地将物资分运各地。运河沿岸的高粱、玉米、大豆、棉花长得很茂盛，农民都无比欢欣地争取秋季大丰收。邳睢县的全国山芋丰产模范杨庆桂互助组，今年的麦子每亩收了三百一十多斤，比去年增产了三成。现在他们正对秋季作物加紧锄草、补肥，以争取每亩山芋产到八千斤，高粱产到四百斤。
