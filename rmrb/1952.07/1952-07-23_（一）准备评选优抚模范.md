    (I) Preparing to Elect and Commend Models of Preferential Treatment

    After two years of mass preferential treatment campaigns, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions that all localities should launch a campaign to elect and commend models of preferential treatment this winter and next spring. This includes electing models among the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, as well as models among the masses and cadres in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. This is an important measure to consolidate and further develop the mass preferential treatment campaign. All localities should immediately make serious preparations and, through this campaign, conduct an in-depth review of this year's preferential treatment work in order to learn from experiences and lessons and improve future preferential treatment work.

    The majority of the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers live in rural areas and engage in agricultural production. Taking North China as an example, their land accounts for more than 10% of the total agricultural land area in the region. Therefore, doing a good job in preferential treatment is not only of great significance for supporting the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but also plays an important role in strengthening national economic construction and carrying out patriotic production increase campaigns.

    Electing and commending models of preferential treatment must involve the broad masses and be led to allow the masses to evaluate each other, such as comparing the land cultivated on behalf of others, comparing the harvests from such cultivation, and comparing daily performance, etc. This kind of evaluation work should start from the township (village) level. The county must strengthen its leadership over the township (village) evaluation campaign and send people down to understand the situation and guide the evaluation work, so as to fully prepare for the election of models at the county level.

    The best way to elect and commend models of preferential treatment is to convene a meeting of representatives of model families of martyrs and soldiers (including revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and model representatives in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers). After the township (village) elections are completed, the county should also convene such a meeting. If possible, the province may also convene such a meeting after the county elections are completed. At the county and provincial meetings of representatives of families of martyrs and soldiers, work situations should be exchanged, work experiences should be summarized, political education should be conducted for all model representatives, and future preferential treatment work plans should be discussed; at the same time, county and provincial preferential treatment models should be selected separately. Such meetings can be held simultaneously with labor model representative meetings, or merged, to reduce the difficulty of preparation. However, the representatives attending the meeting must be genuine model figures; and representatives from all aspects related to preferential treatment work must be able to participate in the meeting. The meeting must fully promote democracy and have a high degree of seriousness, avoiding getting bogged down in disputes over trivial matters; and everyone must be clear about the future work guidelines and methods, rather than just focusing on reviewing past work. In the preparation and conduct of the meeting, all departments related to preferential treatment work must be involved, such as the military, banks, cooperatives, education, and health departments, all of which should send people to attend the meeting to listen to the opinions of representatives of families of martyrs and soldiers, etc., and work together to solve problems.

    After the election of models of preferential treatment, a large number of advanced figures recognized by the masses and closely connected with the masses will emerge. Local government agencies should rely on them to regularly reflect the situation and implement policies, and use this to improve their leadership over preferential treatment work, so that preferential treatment work can achieve greater progress on the existing basis.

    （一）准备评选优抚模范
    经过两年来的群众性的优抚运动之后，中央人民政府内务部最近发布指示，要各地在今冬明春开展一个评选优抚模范的运动，评选革命烈士家属、革命军人家属模范，革命残废军人、复员军人模范，评选群众和干部中的拥军优属模范。这是巩固和进一步开展群众性优抚运动的重要措施。各地应即认真地进行准备，并通过这一运动深入地检查今年的优抚工作，以便吸取经验教训，把今后的优抚工作做得更好。
    烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人大多数居住在农村，从事农业生产。以华北为例，他们的土地占全区农业土地面积百分之十以上。因此，做好优抚工作，不但对支持中国人民军队有着重大的意义，而且对加强国家经济建设和开展爱国丰产运动，也有重要的作用。
    评选优抚模范必须发动广大群众，有领导地让群众自己去互相比评，例如比代耕的土地，比代耕的收获，比平日的表现等等。这种评选的工作，应该从乡（村）作起，县必须加强对乡（村）评选运动的领导，派人下去了解情况和指导评选工作的进行，以便充分做好在县里评选模范的准备。
    评选优抚模范的最好办法是召开烈属军属模范代表（包括革命残废军人、复员军人和拥军优属工作的模范代表人物）会议。乡（村）评选完毕之后，县也要召开这种会议。省如有可能也可在县评选完毕时召开这种会议。在县和省的烈属、军属代表会议上，应该交流工作情况，总结工作经验，向全体模范代表进行政治教育，并讨论今后的优抚工作计划；同时分别评选县的和省的优抚模范。这种会议，可与劳动模范代表会议同时举行，或合并举行，以减少筹备的困难。但参加会议的代表必须是真正的模范人物；并且要使有关优抚工作各方面的代表人物都能参加会议。会议要充分发扬民主，要有高度的严肃性，不要陷于事务的争论；并且必须使大家明确今后的工作方针与办法，不要只顾检查过去的工作。在会议的筹备和进行中，必须吸收与优抚工作有关的各个部门参加，如军队、银行、合作社、教育、卫生等部门，都应该派人出席会议，以便听取烈属、军属等代表的意见，通力合作地解决问题。
    经过评选优抚模范以后，将会出现一大批为群众所公认的、与群众有密切联系的先进人物。各地政府机关应依靠他们去经常地反映情况和贯彻政策，并以此来改进自己对优抚工作的领导，使优抚工作在现有基础上获得更大的进展。
