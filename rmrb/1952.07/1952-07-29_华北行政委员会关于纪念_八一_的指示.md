To the People's Governments of the Five Provinces and Two Municipalities of North China:

August 1st, 1952, marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of the glorious and great Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are the people's armed forces organized by the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. They are the defenders of our motherland and our people, and the vanguard fighters defending world peace. Without the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, there would be no security for our motherland and no peaceful and happy life for our people, nor would it be possible to carry out the great economic and cultural construction. Currently, under the call of Chairman Mao to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the people of North China are enthusiastically carrying out a patriotic production increase and economy competition movement and have achieved considerable results. At the same time, after the first county head conference in North China, especially in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, new achievements have been made. On this day of commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, governments at all levels should further combine it with the patriotic production increase and economy movement, educate the masses to love the motherland and the people's army, and take practical actions, centered on inspecting and strengthening preferential treatment and land cultivation work, to commemorate this great festival. For this purpose, the following main points are specifically stipulated:

	I. Governments at all levels should strengthen the education of the people to love the motherland and the army, and call on the people to deeply develop the production increase and economy competition movement, in order to strengthen our motherland's national defense strength and support the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions to complete and strive to exceed this year's production increase and economy tasks.

	II. In accordance with the resolution of the first county head conference in North China on strengthening preferential treatment work, organize a large-scale inspection movement of preferential treatment work within two weeks before and after "August 1st." Adopt the methods of leaders taking responsibility, holding symposiums for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, individual visits, and inspections village by village, street by street, and household by household to promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and solve problems, so as to further advance the preferential treatment work. In rural areas, the main focus is on inspecting land cultivation work, and conscientiously organizing production for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and solving specific problems in increasing the yield per unit area for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In cities, the focus is on inspecting the work of organizing production and introducing occupations for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.

	III. Implement the spirit of the "Three-Anti" campaign, effectively grasp preferential treatment finances, overcome bureaucracy, conscientiously inspect preferential treatment work, promote advanced methods of preferential treatment work, commend and cultivate models, and lay a good foundation for the movement to evaluate preferential treatment models after the autumn harvest.

	IV. Strengthen militia work, solve existing problems, and further organize and utilize the great strength of the militia in safeguarding local security and national defense construction.

	V. Mobilize the masses, especially labor models, to write letters to the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers, reporting on production and living conditions and expressing condolences; mobilize families of soldiers to write letters to their husbands and children, reporting on production and living conditions. In places with wounded and sick soldiers, the local government leaders should personally visit and express condolences, and may appropriately mobilize the masses to offer comfort and condolences.

The above points are hoped that the people's governments of all localities will formulate plans in accordance with the specific circumstances and implement them effectively. The situation and experience should be reported to this committee by the end of August.

    华北行政委员会关于纪念“八一”的指示
    华北五省二市人民政府：
    一九五二年的八月一日，是光荣伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十五周年纪念日。中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军是中国人民最优秀的儿女组织起来的人民武装，是我们祖国和人民的保卫者，是保卫世界和平的前哨战士。没有中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的英勇奋斗，就不可能有祖国的安全和人民安居乐业的生活，也不可能进行伟大的经济建设和文化建设。目前华北人民正在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召下，热烈地开展着工业农业爱国增产节约竞赛运动，并获得了相当成绩；同时在华北第一次县长会议之后，特别是拥军优抚工作，已获得了新的成就。在纪念“八一”建军节的今天，各级人民政府应进一步结合爱国增产节约运动，教育群众热爱祖国、热爱人民军队，以检查和加强优抚、代耕工作为中心，用实际行动来纪念这个伟大的节日。为此，特规定主要事项如下：
    一、各级人民政府，应加强对人民进行热爱祖国、热爱军队的教育，号召人民深入开展增产节约竞赛运动，以完成并争取超过今年的增产节约任务的实际行动，来加强我们祖国的国防力量，支持中国人民志愿军。
    二、根据华北第一次县长会议关于加强优抚工作的决议，在“八一”前后两周内，组织一次大规模的优抚工作检查运动，采取首长负责，召开烈属、军属座谈会，个别访问，逐村、逐街、逐户进行检查的方法，发扬成绩，纠正缺点，解决问题，以使优抚工作向前推进一步。在农村中主要是检查代耕工作，并认真组织烈属、军属生产，解决烈属、军属提高单位面积产量中的具体问题。在城市着重检查组织烈属、军属生产与介绍职业的工作。
    三、贯彻“三反”精神，切实掌握优抚财务，克服官僚主义，认真检查优抚工作，推广优抚工作的先进方法，表扬与培养模范，给秋收以后评选优抚模范的运动，打下良好的基础。
    四、加强民兵工作，解决其中存在的问题，进
    一步组织与发挥民兵在保卫地方安全和国防建设上的巨大力量。
    五、发动群众，特别是劳动模范向解放军、志愿军写信，报告生产、生活情况，并致慰问；发动军属给丈夫、子弟写信报告生产、生活情况。在有伤、病员的地方，当地人民政府首长应亲往慰问，并可适当发动群众慰劳和慰问。
    以上各点，希各地人民政府按照具体情况，订出计划，切实执行。并将情况及经验于八月底报本委。
             一九五二年七月二十四日
