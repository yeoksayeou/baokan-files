    Northeast China's Rural Areas Promote More Than 25,000 Shovel-Tiller Machines This Year
    Northeast China's rural areas have promoted more than 25,000 "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machines this year, which will play a significant role in ensuring deep plowing and meticulous weeding this year, and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    In view of the successful trial use of 5,000 "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machines last year, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government expanded the scope of promotion this year under the principle of "steady promotion". During this year's summer weeding, there will be more than 30,000 "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machines in the rural areas of Northeast China, performing fine weeding and deep tilling. The biggest feature of the "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machine is that it combines weeding and soil cultivation, which saves labor and produces good results. One person and two horses can weed and till 1.8 hectares (1 hectare = 15 Chinese mu) per day, which can save three labor days per hectare compared with using hoes for weeding and old plows for soil cultivation; three weedings and tillings can save nine labor days. In this way, more than 30,000 "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machines can save at least 4.05 million labor days during the summer weeding stage; at the same time, the weeding depth of the shovel-tiller machine is generally one inch deeper than that of the old plow, and the amount of soil cultivation can be 3% to 4% more, so that 450,000 hectares of land can be deeply plowed and meticulously weeded, and generally can be weeded and tilled more than once than in previous years.
    The "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machine is a combination of the advantages of many shovel-tiller machines, concentrating the wisdom of agricultural technicians and farmers, and manufactured through multiple experiments and modifications. Therefore, it was warmly welcomed by farmers and demanded for large-scale promotion when it was first promoted and trial-used last year. This year, according to the experience of last year's trial use, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government has made some modifications to the "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machine, and ordered various farm implement factories to manufacture them in large quantities according to their production capacity. Heilongjiang Province originally planned to manufacture 7,200 units, but under the urgent request of farmers, it increased by 800 units; Rehe Province, which has less land, also increased from the original plan of 1,500 units to 1,700 units. In order to ensure the specifications and quality of the shovel-tiller machines, all provinces strictly implemented finished product inspections during the manufacturing period; experiments were also conducted before distribution. For example, the 10,000 "Comprehensive Model" shovel-tiller machines promoted in Songjiang Province were personally presided over by the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee before distribution, and technical personnel, rural cadres, and farmers were convened to conduct on-site experiments; then they were promptly distributed to farmers through cooperatives. In terms of technical guidance, in addition to guiding farmers to use shovel-tiller machines through existing agricultural technology promotion stations, various provinces have also held training courses. All of these will ensure that this batch of new agricultural tools will play its due role in this year's summer weeding.

### 东北农村今年又推广二万五千多台铲趟机

    东北农村今年又推广二万五千多台铲趟机
    东北农村今年又推广了二万五千多台“综合号”铲趟机，这对保证今年深耕细锄，推动互助合作运动有着重大作用。
    东北人民政府农业部鉴于去年五千台“综合号”铲趟机已试用成功，今年即在“稳步推广”的方针下，扩大了推广范围。今年夏锄期间，东北农村将有三万多台“综合号”铲趟机，进行细铲深趟。“综合号”铲趟机的最大特点，是把锄草和培土结合进行，既省工又出活。一人二马每天可铲趟一点八垧（每垧十五市亩），比使用锄头除草和旧犁培土，一垧地能节省三个人工，铲趟三遍就节省九个人工。这样三万多台“综合号”铲趟机，在夏锄阶段至少能节省人工四百零五万个；同时，铲趟机锄苗一般都能比旧犁深趟一寸，培土量能多百分之三到四，因此可使四十五万垧土地得到深耕细锄，并普遍能比往年多铲趟一遍以上。
    “综合号”铲趟机是综合许多铲趟机的优点，集中农业技术人员和农民的智慧，经多次试验、修改而制造成功的。因此，在去年初次推广试用时，即受到农民热烈欢迎，要求大量推广。今年，东北人民政府农业部根据去年试用的经验，又将“综合号”铲趟机作了部分修改，责成各农具工厂按生产能力，大量制造。黑龙江省原计划制造七千二百台，但在农民迫切要求下，又增加了八百台；土地较少的热河省，也由原计划一千五百台，增到一千七百台。为了保证铲趟机的规格与质量，各省在制造期间均严格执行了成品检查；发放前又都进行了试验。如松江省推广的一万台“综合号”铲趟机，在发放前由省人民政府主席、中共省委秘书长等亲自主持，并召集技术人员、农村干部和农民做了实地试验；然后通过合作社及时发到农民手里。在技术指导方面，各省除通过已有的农业技术推广站，指导农民使用铲趟机外，还举办了训练班。所有这些都将保证这批新农具，在今年的夏锄中发挥它应有的效能。
