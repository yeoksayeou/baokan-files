    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Yoshida government is unscrupulously carrying out activities to release Japanese war criminals early, using the provisions of Article 11 of the US-imposed separate peace treaty with Japan.
    Prior to the signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan, the US occupation authorities had illegally released 1,257 Japanese war criminals by April 23 of this year. After the separate peace treaty with Japan came into effect, Japanese war criminals were handed over to the Yoshida government for management. The total number of war criminals imprisoned in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo has been reduced to 924, of whom only 13 are Class A war criminals. In order to release all these war criminals, the Yoshida government decided at a cabinet meeting on July 11 that Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki should begin negotiations with relevant countries in accordance with the separate peace treaty with Japan for more than 240 war criminals who have served one-third of their sentences, in order to quickly obtain their "understanding" for their release. It also requested that countries give "appropriate consideration" to other war criminals as much as possible. According to Kyodo News, once the so-called "Sino-Japanese Treaty" signed by the Yoshida government and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant clique comes into effect, 91 war criminals who invaded China will be released first. In addition, the Philippines and Australia are still imprisoning 317 Japanese war criminals respectively. The Yoshida government is preparing to request that they be transferred to Japan as the first step in releasing them.
    The illegal activities of the Yoshida government will inevitably arouse the anger and opposition of people of all countries. Japanese war criminals, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of the Far East, must receive the punishment they deserve.

    吉田政府肆无忌惮进行非法活动
    竟准备释放全部在押战犯
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：吉田政府正利用美制单独对日和约第十一条的规定，为提前释放日本战犯而肆无忌惮地进行活动。
    在单独对日和约之签订前，截至今年四月二十三日为止，美国占领当局曾先后非法释放日本战犯一千二百五十七人。单独对日和约生效以后，日本战犯移交吉田政府管理，囚禁在东京巢鸭监狱的全部战犯人数已减少到九百二十四人，其中甲级战犯只有十三人。吉田政府为了全部释放这些战犯，在七月十一日的内阁会议上决定，对于那些服刑已满三分之一的战犯二百四十多人，由外相冈崎胜男根据单独对日和约分别向有关国家开始交涉，以便迅速获得释放他们的“谅解”。对于其他战犯，也要求各国尽量予以“妥善处理”。据共同社透露，一旦吉田政府与蒋介石残余集团签订的所谓“日华条约”生效以后，侵华战犯九十一人将首先获释。除此以外，菲律宾和澳大利亚还分别囚禁着三百十七名日本战犯。吉田政府正准备要求把他们移解到日本，作为释放他们的第一个步骤。
    吉田政府的非法活动必将引起各国人民的愤怒和反对。双手涂满远东各国人民的鲜血的日本战犯必须受到应得的惩罚。
