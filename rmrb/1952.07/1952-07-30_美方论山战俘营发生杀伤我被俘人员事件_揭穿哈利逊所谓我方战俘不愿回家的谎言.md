Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 29th - The incident on July 27th at the Nonsan POW camp on the mainland, in which eight of our captured personnel were killed and wounded, once again exposes Harrison's lie that only 83,000 of our captured personnel are willing to return home. According to a communique issued by the U.S. Eighth Army, the Nonsan POW camp is where those POWs who will "forcibly refuse repatriation" are detained. About two weeks ago, an incident occurred at this POW camp in which 20 of our captured personnel were wounded. Tens of thousands of our captured personnel were secretly moved by the U.S. side with bayonets from Geoje Island to the mainland, so that Harrison could fabricate the deceptive lie that they did not want to return home.

It is no coincidence that more of our captured personnel who fought to return home using their own strength were killed and wounded at the same time as Harrison's walkout. The end of the administrative meeting revealed the inhumane inside story of the U.S. side's political blackmail of using the lives of POWs as a price for the armistice, and exposed Harrison's use of propaganda lies as an excuse to dispel hope for a Korean armistice, although his propaganda lies were long ago exposed by the bloody events on Geoje Island.

Harrison apparently plays with the lives of POWs as if they were stocks and securities on the New York Stock Exchange. For almost two months, Harrison has repeatedly said that the U.S. side's attitude on the issue of 70,000 POWs is "final and unchangeable." In April, U.S. Colonel Hickman told reporters that this figure was obtained after "screening" all POWs. However, at the administrative meeting, Harrison admitted that due to the protests of our captured personnel, "interviews" were not conducted with all of our captured personnel. He then proposed the repatriation figure of 83,000 POWs and refused to negotiate further.

Harrison has repeatedly and shamelessly and hypocritically said in the past two months: "The question asked is actually encouraging these people to return to your control." How were our captured personnel "actually encouraged"? The U.S. side used more than one division of troops, including a regiment of U.S. paratroopers, against our captured personnel on Geoje Island. Based solely on official U.S. and U.S. news reports, in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel and prevent them from expressing their desire to return home, since February 18th, not counting previous massacres, more than 800 POWs have been killed and wounded with flamethrower tanks, tear gas, grenades and machine guns.

For more than a week, Harrison has been afraid to deny the condemnation that the U.S. side forced the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers it detained to become secret agents and parachuted them into North Korea. These secret agents are now in the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and their confessions prove that the American officers on Geoje Island have violated every provision of the Geneva Convention in order to implement the conspiracy to obstruct the return of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to their country.

As early as last September, a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents arrived from Taiwan to Geoje Island to implement the terror tactics of the Kuomintang bandit gang concentration camps against the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They gave the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers insufficient rations to force them to submit. In order to make our captured personnel afraid of returning home, they tattooed reactionary slogans on the bodies of our captured personnel on a large scale. They drew a picture of a POW on posters, his eyes looking at his arm tattooed with words, with the caption: "What will happen to you if you return home?" They stipulated the deadline for all POWs to complete the tattooing, and in order to complete it on time, torture and beatings were used to the extreme, even tattooing the POWs after they were beaten unconscious.

The captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were subjected to the Kuomintang bandit gang's "ideological control." The "schools" under the U.S. Civil Administration Propaganda and Education Office forced the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to read Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" and the history of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Our captured personnel called these courses "bloody courses" because anyone who refused to attend would be forced to kneel on the ground and beaten unconscious.

Last November, in order to prepare for welcoming Ridgway's inspection of Geoje Island, they forced the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to sign blood oaths demanding to "join the Taiwan National Army and counterattack the mainland." Those who refused to sign were beaten unconscious, and then their fingers were dipped in blood and pressed on the petition praising "voluntary repatriation is fair and reasonable."

These revelations prove that Harrison's statement that more than 13,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers would rather commit suicide than return home is a complete lie. Observers point out that Harrison's decision to adopt a walkout policy is now an attempt by the U.S. side to defend this exposed propaganda lie, but at the same time, it completely exposes the hypocritical face of the U.S. side at the conference table, and once again irrefutably proves the U.S. side's determination to continue to indefinitely delay the armistice negotiations.

    美方论山战俘营发生杀伤我被俘人员事件
    揭穿哈利逊所谓我方战俘不愿回家的谎言
    【新华社开城二十九日电】七月二十七日，在大陆上的论山战俘营发生了杀害和打伤八名我方被俘人员的事件，这又一次揭穿了哈利逊所说的只有八万三千名我方被俘人员愿意回家的谎话。据美国第八军发表的公报说，论山战俘营是拘留那些将“强力拒绝遣返”的战俘的。约在两星期以前，这个战俘营就发生了二十名我方被俘人员被打伤的事件。我方数万被俘人员被美方用刺刀逼迫着秘密地从巨济岛迁到大陆上去，以便哈利逊能够编造他们不愿回家的骗人的鬼话。
    和哈利逊逃会同时，有更多的用自己力量奋斗回家的我方被俘人员被杀害和打伤，这不是偶然的。行政性会议的结束，揭露了美方以战俘生命作为停战代价的政治讹诈行为的不人道内幕，揭露了哈利逊利用宣传的谎话来作为打消朝鲜停战希望的藉口，虽然他的宣传谎话早被巨济岛的流血事件所揭穿了。
    哈利逊显然把战俘的生命当作纽约股票市场的股票和证券一样来玩弄。几乎两个月以来，哈利逊常重复地说，美方在七万名战俘数字问题上的态度是“最后不移的”。在四月间，美方希克曼上校对新闻记者说，这个数字是在对全部战俘作了“甄别”以后得出的。但是在行政性会议上，哈利逊承认，由于我方被俘人员的抗议，因此没有对我方全部被俘人员进行“询问”。他于是提出八万三千名战俘的遣返数字，而拒绝再进行谈判。
    哈利逊在过去两个月中一再无耻而伪善地说：“所问的问题实际上是鼓励这些人回到你们控制之下去的。”我方被俘人员是如何受到“实际上鼓励”的呢？美方曾经对巨济岛上的我方被俘人员使用一师多军队，其中包括一团美国伞兵。仅仅根据美国官方和美国新闻界的消息，美方为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，不许他们表示要求回家的愿望，自二月十八日以来，以前屠杀的还不算在内，就用喷火坦克、催泪瓦斯、手榴弹和机关枪杀死和打伤了八百多名战俘。
    一个多星期以来，哈利逊一直不敢否认美方曾强迫它所拘留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员当特务、并使他们从空中降落在北朝鲜这样一个谴责。这些特务现在在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的手里，他们的坦白证明了巨济岛上的美国长官为了执行阻挠中国人民志愿军被俘人员回国的阴谋，业已违反了日内瓦公约的每一条规定。
    早在去年九月，就有大批蒋匪特务从台湾到了巨济岛，来对中国人民志愿军被俘人员实行国民党匪帮集中营的恐怖手段。他们给中国人民志愿军被俘人员的口粮不足一饱，借此来逼迫他们屈服。为了使我方被俘人员害怕回国，他们大规模地在我方被俘人员身上刺上反动口号。他们在招贴画上画一个战俘，眼睛望着自己被刺上了字的手臂，旁边写着：“要是你回国去，你会落得怎样的下场？”他们规定了所有战俘完成刺字的期限，为了按期完成，酷刑和拷打已无所不用其极，甚至把战俘打伤打昏了之后，在他们的身上刺字。
    中国人民志愿军被俘人员受到国民党匪帮的“思想管制”。美国民政宣传教育处所辖的“学校”强迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员读蒋介石写的“中国之命运”和国民党匪帮的历史。我方被俘人员把这些课程叫做“血的课程”，因为谁要拒绝听课，就要被罚跪在地上，并被打得不省人事。
    去年十一月，为了准备欢迎李奇微巡视巨济岛，他们强迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员签血书，要求“参加台湾国军，反攻大陆”。那些拒绝签字的人被打得昏迷不醒，然后就把他们的手指浸在血里，捺在那讴歌“自愿遣返是公平合理”的请愿书上。
    这些揭发证明了哈利逊所说有一万三千余名中国人民志愿军被俘人员宁愿自杀也不肯回家，乃是一个彻头彻尾的谎言。观察家指出，现在哈利逊不得不采取逃会政策，是美方企图为这种已被拆穿的宣传谎言辩护，但同时就彻底暴露了美方在会议桌上所表现的伪善面目，再次无可辩驳地证明美方决心把停战谈判继续无限期地拖延下去。
