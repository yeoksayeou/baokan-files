(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th) TASS Moscow, 10th: The USSR Council of Ministers, after examining the report of the builders of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal and the inspection report of the government committee led by Sokolov, chairman of the government committee responsible for the acceptance of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal equipment, confirmed that the government's plan for building and using the Volga-Don Shipping Canal, the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station, and the equipment for irrigating the initial 100,000 hectares of arid land in Rostov Oblast has been completed on schedule.

The projects built between 1949 and 1952 include:

(1) The Volga-Don Shipping Canal, 101 kilometers long, with thirteen navigation locks, three pumping stations, thirteen dams, seven spillway weirs and sluice gates, two sluice gates for repairs and emergencies, eight bridges, as well as ferry crossings, anchorages, wharves, and 100 kilometers of roads along the canal bank.

(2) The Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project, including a 12.75-kilometer-long earth dam, a 495.5-meter-long concrete spillway weir, a hydroelectric power station, two navigation locks, a 4.9-kilometer-long navigation canal between the two locks, an outer harbor, a main irrigation facility, and an overpass for the railway and highway along the dam.

(3) The Don irrigation main canal, extending 27 kilometers from the main water distribution facility on the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project dam to the main facility of the Lower Don branch canal; the Lower Don branch canal, extending 72.9 kilometers; and the Azov branch canal, extending 92.2 kilometers.

(4) The new railway line from the Morozovskaya station on the Stalingrad Railway to the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project and from the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project to the Kubere station on the Stalingrad Railway, totaling 174 kilometers.

During the construction of the above facilities, the following work was completed: 152.21 million cubic meters of earthwork (excavation and embankment), 2.96 million cubic meters of reinforced concrete and concrete structures, reinforcement of earth dams over an area of 2.9 million square meters, laying of stone roads, filtration equipment, and drainage equipment of 1.6 million cubic meters, driving of 16,000 tons of metal sheet piles, and assembly of 44,400 tons of construction steel and equipment.

The construction of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal and the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project was completed using very powerful and highly efficient machines and equipment manufactured in the Soviet Union.

During the construction process, many important scientific and technical problems in water conservancy engineering have been solved, such as the problem of establishing huge water conservancy engineering facilities under complex geographical conditions, the problem of high-speed construction of earth dams, the problem of large-scale use of groundwater lowering methods, and other problems.

A group of new skilled workers—excavator and dredger operators, water conservancy equipment operators, crane operators, installation workers, concrete workers, and assembly workers—as well as engineers and technicians, who guaranteed a high level of labor productivity, have been trained at the construction site.

The factories and assembly organizations of the Ministry of Power Stations, the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing, the Ministry of Electrical Industry, the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Manufacturing, the Ministry of Construction and Road-building Machinery Manufacturing, the Ministry of Transport Machinery Manufacturing, the Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Construction of Machine Manufacturing Enterprises, and other ministries have done a great deal of work in the manufacture and assembly of construction steel, components, machines, and equipment.

The completion of the construction project of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal, carried out in accordance with the decision of the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), connects the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea into a waterway transportation system, which will enable the transportation of large quantities of goods—coal, timber, cement, oil, and grain—through this transportation system in 1952.

The USSR Council of Ministers also pointed out that the construction of the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project, with a large reservoir and a hydroelectric power station, as well as the construction of the Don main canal and the main parts of the Lower Don and Azov branch canals, guarantees the preliminary irrigation of 100,000 hectares of arid land in Rostov Oblast in 1952, and guarantees the irrigation of another 650,000 hectares of land at a certain time in the future. Based on the utilization of the water resources of the Don River and cheap electricity, it also provides water to 2 million hectares of arid and semi-desert land in Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast.

The USSR Council of Ministers decided:

(1) The Volga-Don Shipping Canal will be open to navigation on July 27th of this year, ensuring the establishment of regular passenger and freight vessel services from that day onwards, and simultaneously starting to use the first part of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station and irrigation equipment. The USSR Council of Ministers has ordered Shashkov, Minister of Inland Water Transport, to preside over the opening ceremony of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal.

(2) Order the Ministry of Inland Water Transport to ensure regular passenger vessel services on the Moscow-Rostov and Stalingrad-Kalach routes, to organize suburban transportation in the areas of the ports of Stalingrad, Rostov, Tsimlyansk, and Kalach, and to ensure the establishment of transportation for freight and passenger traffic in 1952 in accordance with the established plan.

(3) In accordance with the previous decision of the government, ensure the use of electricity from the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture and industry, the needs of electrified cultivation, and the large-scale mechanization of laborious work in livestock departments and other departments in the production of collective farms and state farms.

(4) In accordance with the order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, name the Volga-Don Shipping Canal after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and name the canal the Lenin Volga-Don Shipping Canal.

    苏联部长会议发布
    关于伏尔加河—顿河运河的决定
    运河命名为列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：苏联部长会议审查了伏尔加河—顿河通航运河建筑者的报告以及由负责验收伏尔加河—顿河通航运河设备的政府委员会主席索科罗夫率领的政府委员会的视察报告，确认政府关于建筑并使用伏尔加河—顿河通航运河、齐姆良水电站和供罗斯多夫州初期十万公顷旱地灌溉之用的设备的计划业已如期完成。
    在一九四九年——一九五二年期间建筑的工程计有：
    （一）伏尔加河—顿河通航运河，长达一百零一公里，有十三个航行闸，三个抽水站，十三个堤坝，七个放水堰和水门，两个供修理时及紧急使用的水门，八座桥梁，还有渡口、碇泊处、码头以及运河岸上长达一百公里的公路。
    （二）齐姆良水电工程，包括一个十二点七五公里长的土堤，一个四百九十五点五公尺长的混凝土的放水堰，一个水电站，两个航行闸，两个闸之间长达四点九公里的航行运河，一处外港，一处主要灌溉设备，以及沿堤坝一带的铁路与公路的高架桥。
    （三）顿河的灌溉干渠，从齐姆良水电工程堤坝上的主要分水设备到顿河下游分支运河的主要设备，长达二十七公里；顿河下游分支运河长达七十二点九公里；亚速分支运河长达九十二点二公里。
    （四）从斯大林格勒铁路的莫洛佐夫斯卡亚车站到齐姆良水电工程以及从齐姆良水电工程到斯大林格勒铁路的库别列站的新铁路线，共达一百七十四公里。
    在建筑以上各项设备时，完成的工作如下：修土方（掘土与堆土）一亿五千二百一十万立方公尺，建筑钢筋混凝土和混凝土工程二百九十六万立方公尺，在二百九十万平方公尺的地区上增强土坝，铺设石道、滤水设备和排水设备一百六十万立方公尺，打下了一万六千吨的金属栅板，装配了四万四千四百吨的建筑用钢与设备。
    伏尔加河—顿河通航运河与齐姆良水电工程的建筑，是用苏联制造的非常有力、非常有效率的机器与装备完成的。
    在建筑的过程中，有许多水利工程方面的重要的科学与技术问题都解决了，例如在复杂的地理条件下建立巨大的水利工程设备的问题，高速建筑土坝的问题，大规模使用降低地下水的方法的问题，以及其他问题。
    在工地上已培养出一批新的熟练工人——掘凿机和挖泥机操作者、水利工程设备操作者、起重机操作者、装置工人、混凝土工人和装配工人——以及工程师和技术员，他们保证了高度的劳动生产率。
    电站部、重型机器制造部、电气工业部、机器和器械制造部、建造和筑路机器制造部、运输机器制造部、重工业企业建造部、铁道部、机器制造企业建造部及其他部的工厂和装配组织，在制造与装配建筑用钢、机件、机器和设备方面做了很多工作。
    遵照苏联部长会议和苏联共产党（布）中央委员会的决定所进行的伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的建筑工程的完成，使白海、波罗的海、里海和亚速海及黑海连接起来，成为一个水路运输系统，得以在一九五二年经由这个运输系统运输大宗货物——煤、木材、水泥、油类及谷物。
    苏联部长会议还指出：齐姆良水电工程和一个大水库及一个水力发电站的建筑，以及顿河干渠和顿河下游及亚速分支运河的主要部分的建筑，保证在一九五二年初步灌溉罗斯多夫州的十万公顷旱地，并保证在将来一定的时候灌溉另外六十五万公顷田地，并在利用顿河的水源和便宜的电力的基础上，使罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州的二百万公顷旱地和半沙漠土地得到水的供应。
    苏联部长会议决定：
    （一）伏尔加河—顿河通航运河在本年七月二十七日通航，保证从那天起建立客运和货运轮船的经常班次，同时开始使用齐姆良水力发电站和灌溉设备的第一部分。苏联部长会议已命令内河航运部部长沙什柯夫主持伏尔加河—顿河通航运河通航典礼。
    （二）命令内河航运部保证莫斯科—罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒—卡拉奇航线的客运轮船的经常班次，在斯大林格勒、罗斯多夫、齐姆良和卡拉奇各港口的地区，组织郊外交通，并根据既定的计划，保证在一九五二年建立来往货运和客运的交通运输。
    （三）根据政府先前的决定，保证使用齐姆良水电站的电力，以满足灌溉农业的需要和工业的需要、电气化耕作的需要和集体农场和国家农场生产中家畜饲养部及其他部门的费力工作的大规模机械化的需要。
    （四）遵照苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令，以乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁的名字为伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的名字，把运河命名为列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河。
