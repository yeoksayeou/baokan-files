    Our Whole Family is Making Progress
    -- A Letter from Han Defen, Family Member of a Railway Worker from the Fengtai Vehicle Depot of the Tianjin Railway Administration, to her Husband Aiding Korea

    Comrade Zhao Zhenting:
    Since you went to Korea last year on this day, I have constantly received letters from you. I don't know how many times I have read each letter. Your work and life situation have not only encouraged me but also the workers in the depot. The workers in the depot say: Seeing Zhao Zhenting's letter makes me feel full of energy. Your glorious action of volunteering to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has also encouraged our whole family to move forward.

    Now, let me tell you about the situation at home. Things have changed at home since you left a year ago. The depot has hung a plaque of honor at our door. Representatives from the Party, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and family members of the depot often come to our home to offer their regards. Any difficulties are resolved immediately. For example, one time we didn't have much firewood left, and I didn't say anything, but the family representative saw it, and the depot quickly sent a load of firewood. Since then, they have often sent us wood. The comrades in the depot are really considerate to the families of those aiding Korea. On the Dragon Boat Festival, the labor insurance committee of the trade union also sent a big bag of zongzi.

    The people in our family are also much more progressive in their thinking than before. First of all, I should mention our mother. Besides being in good health, she has also become an active member of the patriotic health campaign. She goes out to do propaganda work for half a day every day, checking hygiene from door to door. Sometimes she is exhausted and covered in sweat, but she never complains and is always happy. When you first left home, she missed you; but now she feels that your work is glorious and your responsibility is great, so she is happy whenever she talks about you. Sometimes she talks to others about you and about the principles of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and she goes on and on. She often urges me to go to the depot to study, and she patiently coaxes the children at home. Once, I was busy with housework and missed a day of study, and she said to me, "Defen, you must study hard! In the future, when Zhenting performs meritorious service and becomes a hero in Korea, how wonderful it would be if you could be a model student at home!" Zhenting, our mother is making such progress, how can I not work hard and study hard?

    Our younger brother, Zhensheng, was admitted to the depot as an apprentice worker last year. He is very enthusiastic in his work and study. He was also praised by the trade union during the "Three-Anti" movement. Strangely enough, even our children are obedient. She reviews her lessons every night and is not naughty at all.

    In addition to studying for two hours every day at the depot's family spare-time school, I have also been elected as the propaganda committee member. Although I am very busy every day, everyone likes to listen when I do propaganda, and I am getting happier and happier as I do it. Now I am planning to learn to sing kuaiban.

    The depot is currently carrying out a movement of loading fully, exceeding the axle load, and traveling five hundred kilometers. I have also made a patriotic work plan: 1. Ensure that my younger brother can eat on time and have delicious meals after work so that he can work and produce with peace of mind. 2. Ensure good sanitation, wash and change the family's clothes frequently, and clean indoors and outdoors frequently. 3. Ensure that the children are well-educated, without hitting or scolding, so that she is always healthy and lively. 4. Be sure to do a good job in local propaganda so that every family and everyone knows the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism, knows the bright future of New China, and encourages everyone to do a good job and increase the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. I will check these four points once a week and ask our mother and younger brother to be inspectors. If I don't do well enough, they will criticize me, and I will try to improve.

    Zhenting, I hope you will write to me and give me suggestions to help me make progress. I wish you hard work and progress in your work and study, and that you will do your work even better and support the soldiers on the front lines to eliminate more American devils!

    Your wife, Han Defen, June 12th

    咱们全家都在进步
    ——天津铁路管理局丰台车辆段援朝职工家属韩德芬给丈夫的信振庭同志：
    自从去年今天你去朝鲜以后，家里不断地收到你的来信。每一封信，我不知要看多少遍。你的工作情况和生活情况，不但鼓舞了我，也鼓舞了段上的工友。段上的工友说：看到赵振庭的信，感到浑身都是劲。你志愿抗美援朝的光荣行动，也鼓舞了咱全家前进。
    现在，我把家里的情况告诉你吧。你走了一年，家里变样了。段上给咱家门口挂了光荣匾。本段的党、行政、工会、青年团和家属的代表们，经常上咱家来慰问。有什么困难马上就解决。比如有一次咱家木柴不多了，我并没有说，可是家属代表看见了，段上很快就送来了一抬木柴。从那时起，他们就经常给咱送。段上同志们照顾援朝职工家属可真周到。端阳节那天，工会劳保委员还送来了一大包粽子。
    咱家的人在思想上也比以前进步多了。首先应该说到咱妈。她除了身体很好，还成了爱国卫生运动中的积极分子。每天半天半天地出去做宣传工作，挨门挨户检查卫生。有时累得满头大汗也不说累，总是高高兴兴的。你刚离家的时候，她想念你；但是，现在她感到你的工作光荣，责任重大，所以一谈到你就高兴。有时她和别人谈起你，谈起抗美援朝的道理，半天没个完。她经常督促我到段上去学习，她在家耐心哄小孩。有一次我因为家里活忙，耽误了一天学习，她就对我说：“德芬，你学习可要使劲呀！将来振庭在朝鲜立功当英雄，你能在家当个学习模范有多好！”振庭，咱妈这样进步，你说我能不好好工作、好好学习吗？
    弟弟振声去年考上了段上的学徒工。他在工作上、学习上都很起劲。在“三反”运动中还得到工会的表扬。说也奇怪，连咱们的小孩都听话了。她每天晚上复习功课，一点也不淘气。
    我除去每天在段上的家属业余学校学习两小时以外，还当选为宣传委员。每天虽然很忙，但是宣传起来大伙爱听，我越做越高兴。现在我正想学习唱快板。
    段上正在开展满载超轴五百公里运动。我也订了一个爱国工作计划：一、保证弟弟下班能准时吃饭，饭菜可口，让他安心工作搞生产。二、保证搞好清洁卫生，一家人的衣服勤洗勤换，室内室外勤打扫。三、保证把小孩教养好，不打不骂，让她永远健康活泼。四、一定把地方宣传工作做好，使每一家每一人都知道美帝国主义的侵略罪行，都知道新中国的美好前途，鼓动大家都搞好工作，增加抗美援朝的力量。这四条，我每星期要检查一次，并请咱妈和弟弟做检查员。我做得不够好的地方，他们就提出批评，我也努力改进。
    振庭，希望你来信给我提意见，帮助我进步。祝你在工作中、学习中努力前进，把你的工作做得更好，支援前线上的战士更多地消灭美国鬼子！
    你的妻子韩德芬六月十二日
