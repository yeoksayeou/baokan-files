Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: According to a Vietnam News Agency report, the Vietnamese People's Army has recently crushed several "sweeps" by the invading French army in North Vietnam, achieving significant victories. According to incomplete statistics, from the liberation of Hoa Binh City on February 23rd to the end of May, the People's Army eliminated 11,000 French troops.

In order to conceal the disastrous defeat of losing 22,000 troops in the Hoa Binh campaign, the invading French army has been boasting greatly in recent months about the nearly twenty "sweeps" conducted in five provinces of North Vietnam. The French army used forces ranging from three battalions for two or three days to eighteen or twenty battalions for ten to twenty days in these "sweeps." However, when the French army concentrated a significant force in one area, it exposed weaknesses in other areas. As a result, the People's Army was able to bypass the French encirclements and attack areas with weak French defenses, thus seizing the initiative in the war, while the French army was often in a situation of being unable to attend to both ends, passively taking a beating.

For example, at the end of March, the invading French army concentrated twenty battalions to attack the triangular guerrilla zone in the eastern part of Thai Binh province, bounded by the Tra Ly River, the Red River, and the coast. The People's Armed Forces intercepted the French army on transportation lines and in villages, and in the first four battles alone, they eliminated 560 French troops. When the French army, regardless of heavy casualties, rushed to the coast in separate routes to encircle, the main force of the People's Army had already moved behind enemy lines and launched a series of powerful attacks, eliminating more than 300 French troops in one battle alone and rescuing 1,000 youths and 30,000 civilians who had been forcibly conscripted by the French army. Under these circumstances, the French army had to retreat in panic after losing more than 1,200 elite troops, and the "Mercury" "sweep" completely failed.

In addition, the People's Army's attacks in different areas often forced the French army to transfer troops from one province to another, making the French army feel like it was caught in a vortex, constantly on the run. For example, at the beginning of April, the invading French army was forced to withdraw heavy troops from Thai Binh province to Bac Ninh province to cope with the People's Army, which had destroyed the two important strongholds of Lac Tho and Ngo Khe, and had to divide its forces to defend the Bui Chu-Nam Dinh area and other towns and transportation lines. These French troops were also fiercely intercepted by the People's Army on the road. While the French army was conducting a so-called "sweep" in Bac Ninh province, the People's Army north of the Luc River gave the local French army a heavy blow. The French army had to gather about eighteen battalions from various places, with the cooperation of aircraft, artillery, and mechanized units, to conduct "sweeps" in the guerrilla areas of Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces north of the Luc River. In crushing the French army's "sweep" north of the Luc River, the local People's Army inflicted heavy losses on the French army. In one battle north of An Thi alone, the People's Army killed 120 French troops. From April 23rd to May 17th, the People's Army eliminated about 2,000 enemy troops in this area.

Faced with the series of victories of the Vietnamese People's Army in North Vietnam, the French bourgeois newspapers also found it difficult to conceal their pessimistic mood. "France Soir" recently said: Although the French have launched many battles called "Marco," "Turco," "Polo," "Duromarti," etc., the Vietnamese People's Army is increasingly active on the plains, and Vietnamese guerrillas are also active everywhere.

### 越南人民军三个月歼敌一万多人

    越南人民军三个月歼敌一万多人
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社消息，越南人民军最近数月在北越地区粉碎了侵越法军的多次“扫荡”，获得了巨大的战果。据不完全的统计，人民军自二月二十三日解放和平城起到五月底止，共歼灭了法军一万一千人。
    侵越法军为了掩饰在和平战役中丧师二万二千人的惨败，近数月来曾大事吹嘘他们在北越五省进行的将近二十次的“扫荡”战。法军在这些“扫荡”战中使用的兵力，较小的有三个营，为期两三天，最大的有十八个到二十个营，为期十天到二十天。但是，由于法军在一个地区集中相当大的兵力时，它在别的地区就暴露了弱点。这样，人民军就能够绕过法军的包围圈，向法军防守力薄弱的地区进攻，因而掌握了战争的主动权，而法军则经常处于顾头不顾尾、被动挨打的境地。
    例如，三月底，侵越法军曾集中了二十个营的兵力，向太平省东部以茶里河、红河与海岸为界的三角形游击区进攻。人民武装在交通线上和村庄里截击法军，一开头就在四次战斗中歼灭了法军五百六十人。当法军不顾惨重伤亡分路冲到海边合围的时候，人民军的主力部队已经转移到敌后，并发动了一连串的强有力的攻击，单在其中一个战斗中便歼灭了法军三百多名，救出了被法军强拉去的青年一千人和平民三万人。在这种情况下，法军在损失了精锐一千二百多名以后，不得不仓皇撤退，这次号称“水银”的“扫荡”战完全失败。
    此外，人民军在不同的地区出击，常迫使法军从这一省调兵到那一省，又从那一省调兵到这一省；这就使得法军如陷入漩涡之中，疲于奔命。例如：四月初，侵越法军就曾被迫从太平省抽调重兵到北宁省去应付摧毁了乐寿和吴溪两个重要据点的人民军，并且不得不分兵去保卫裴朱—南定地区以及其他城镇与交通线。这些法军在路上又受到了人民军的猛烈截击。当法军在北宁省进行所谓“扫荡”战的时候，渌江以北的人民军又给当地的法军以沉重的打击。法军只得从各地调集了约十八个营的兵力，在飞机、大炮和机械化部队配合下，到渌江以北海阳和兴安两省的游击区去进行“扫荡”。而地方人民军在粉碎法军在渌江以北的“扫荡”战中，又使法军蒙受了重大损失。单在安诗以北的一场战斗中，人民军便击毙了法军一百二十名。从四月二十三日到五月十七日间，人民军在这一带又歼灭了敌军约二千名。
    法国资产阶级报纸面对越南人民军在北越的一连串的胜利，也难于隐瞒他们的悲观情绪。“法兰西晚报”最近说：虽然法国人已经发动了许多叫作“马可”“土尔可”“孛罗”“杜洛马第”等等的战斗，越南人民军队却在平原上日益增多，越南游击队也到处在活跃。
