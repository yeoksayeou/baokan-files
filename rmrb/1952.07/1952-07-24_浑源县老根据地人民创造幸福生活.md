    People in the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Hunyuan County Create a Happy Life

    Editor: The Second District of Hunyuan County, Chahar Province, is one of the old revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people here, after land reform and a series of arduous recovery work, have transformed the scorched earth ravaged by the enemy into a lush green forest and farmland. New rows of houses have been built on the mountainside. Once, when I talked with the local villagers about their living conditions, one of them began by saying, "Our entire district now has 2,641 households. The arable land has been restored to the acreage before the Anti-Japanese War; in addition, there are more than 2,690 cattle, more than 290 donkeys, more than 4,550 sheep, and eight horses. Every family has cattle and sheep now." Another villager chimed in, "Every family not only has cattle and sheep, but also pigs and camels. This has never happened before!" The afforestation achievements in this district are also significant, with more than 290,000 trees planted in the past year or two. The villagers also mentioned that adults and children are all wearing new clothes. Every household has quilts and new mats. There are no problems with food, clothing, and daily necessities. All 28 administrative villages and three natural villages in the district have primary schools, and 100% of school-age children are enrolled. Since last year, 17 students have entered complete primary schools, and two students have entered middle school, which is also unprecedented in the mountainous area. In addition, 26 villages in the district have established year-round people's schools, and 90% of young men and women are also attending school. Moreover, people in the mountainous area can watch movies two or three times a year. Some villages have also established drama troupes. In the villages, young people and children can often be seen dancing the lively and joyful "Solidarity Dance." Women have organized "baby-holding groups" during the busy farming season to ensure that both production and learning are not neglected. There are so many new things that one could talk about them for days and nights.

    The people in the mountainous area are spreading the word: "Chairman Mao is truly the great savior of the people; Chairman Mao has brought us endless happiness."

    浑源县老根据地人民创造幸福生活
    编辑同志：察哈尔省浑源县二区是抗日时期的革命老根据地之一。这里的人民在共产党的领导下，经过了土地改革和一连串的艰苦的恢复工作，那曾被敌人蹂躏成一片焦土的地方，如今已变成一片绿油油的森林和庄稼了。山腰上又新盖了一排排崭新的房舍。一次，我和当地老乡们谈起他们的生活情形时，一位老乡开头就说：“我们全区现在有二千六百四十一户人家。能种的地已经恢复到抗日战争前的亩数；另外有牛二千六百九十多头，驴二百九十多头，羊四千五百五十多只，马八匹。每家都有牛羊了。”又一位老乡抢着说：“每家不光有了牛羊，还有了猪和骆驼呢。这是从没有过的事！”这个区造林的成绩也是很大的，在最近一、二年内，就植树二十九万多棵。老乡们还谈到：大人、小孩都穿上新衣服了。户户都有了被子盖，都有了新席铺。吃、穿、用全不成问题了。全区二十八个行政村，三个自然村都有了小学，学龄儿童百分之百地入学了。从去年起，有十七个学生进了完全小学，有两个学生进了中学，这也是山区空前的事儿。另外，全区建立常年民校的已有二十六个村，百分之九十的青年男女也都上学了。另外，在山区一年能看上二、三次电影。有的村还建立了剧团。在村中，不时可见青年和儿童们在活泼愉快地跳“团结舞”。妇女们为了生产、学习两不误，在农忙期间组织了“抱娃娃组”。新鲜的事儿，真是几天几夜也说不完。
    山区人民传诵着：“毛主席真是人民的大救星，毛主席给我们带来的幸福无穷尽。”
