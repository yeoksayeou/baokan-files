    Revolutionary Military Service Certificates Should Be Quickly Transferred to Military Families
    Our unit issued 389 Revolutionary Military Service Certificates in late January this year, requesting local county people's governments to forward them. In late June, many military families wrote saying that they had not yet received the certificates. Although these certificates were sent from the Korean front, it has been more than five months, and the local county people's governments should have received them. If they have been received but not distributed in a timely manner, this is wrong. We suggest that local county people's governments carefully check and quickly issue the Revolutionary Military Service Certificates to their families, so that military families can enjoy the preferential treatment they deserve as soon as possible, and so that soldiers can work more confidently at the front.

    应该把革命军人证明书迅速转给军人家属
    我部在今年一月下旬发出革命军人证明书三百八十九份，请各地县人民政府代转。六月下旬，不少军人家属来信说，还没有收到证明书。这些证明书虽然是由朝鲜前线寄出的，但至今已有五个多月，各地县人民政府应该收到了。如果收到了而没有及时发下去，这是不对的。我们建议各地县人民政府认真检查一下，迅速把革命军人证明书发给其家属，以便使军人家属早日享受应得的优待，使战士在前线能更安心工作。
