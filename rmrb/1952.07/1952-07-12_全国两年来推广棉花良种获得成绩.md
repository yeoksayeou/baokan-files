Achievements in Promoting Improved Cotton Varieties Nationwide in the Past Two Years

In the past two years, governments at all levels have achieved significant results in the propagation and promotion of improved cotton varieties. As a result of the promotion of improved varieties, the average yield per unit area of cotton fields has increased, and the quality of cotton has also improved.

In 1950, various regions across the country began to carry out the propagation and promotion of improved cotton varieties in a planned manner. In 1949, improved cotton planting area only accounted for 10.7% of the cotton field area. In 1950, the area of improved varieties accounted for 19% of the cotton field area. In 1951, it accounted for 28.8%, and this year it has accounted for half of the country's cotton field area. In the past two years, the area of improved cotton fields has increased by eight or nine times compared with 1949. In two or three years, improved varieties of cotton can be popularized throughout the country. In terms of increasing production, improved varieties of cotton yield an average of more than 10% more per mu than ordinary cotton. In Hebei Province in 1951, the average yield per mu in the improved seed propagation area was 43% higher than in the general cotton area; the average yield per mu in the improved seed promotion area was 14.8% higher than in the general cotton area. The Linfen improved seed propagation area in Shanxi Province produced an average of 120 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the general cotton area produced only 90 jin. If the area of improved cotton promoted in 1951 is calculated with a 10% increase in production, the lint cotton production increased by more than 700,000 dan last year. Due to the large-scale promotion of improved varieties, the quality of cotton has also improved significantly. First of all, the relative amount of coarse lint cotton has decreased year by year. Nationwide, the production of coarse lint cotton accounted for about 26% of the total production in 1950, but it accounted for 21.6% in 1951 (due to the certain advantages of coarse lint cotton, the area has also increased in the past two years, but the proportion is relatively decreasing). Secondly, there have also been improvements in fiber length. For example, in the North China region in 1949, cotton with a staple length of 15/16 inch and above accounted for 10% of the total output, and cotton with a staple length of 13/16 inch and below accounted for 51%; while in 1951, cotton with a staple length of 15/16 inch and above accounted for 29% of the total output, and cotton with a staple length of 13/16 inch and below accounted for 27.5%. Due to the increase in the production of long-staple cotton, the efficiency of spinning has also increased. For example, some yarn factories in North China use 25/32 inch raw cotton for medium-count yarn, and the yarn production per spindle is 0.9 pounds in 20 hours. After changing to 27/32 inch raw cotton, the yarn production per spindle reaches 1.05 pounds in 20 hours, and the tensile strength of the yarn is also greatly enhanced. The Wu'ai cotton promoted in Shandong has long and neat staple fibers and can be spun into 60-count fine yarn, which was not available in past domestic cotton. Because of the high yield and good quality of improved varieties, farmers love improved cotton seeds. Farmers in Tangyi County, Pingyuan Province, regard the Sizi No. 2 cotton seed as a precious gift to relatives and friends.

In the past two years, the People's Government has vigorously supported farmers technically and economically in order to popularize improved cotton. All cotton-producing areas in the country have established improved seed propagation areas, with a total area of 2.5 million mu nationwide. The main promotion methods are to mobilize farmers to select seeds and exchange seeds with each other. Farmers in Pingyuan, Shandong and other places giving improved seeds to relatives and friends is the best way to promote them. In the past two years, specialized agencies have been established in various improved seed propagation areas, and technical cadres are regularly sent to the countryside to provide guidance. Cooperatives in various places have also made great contributions to the promotion of improved cotton varieties. In order to prevent the mixing and loss of improved seeds, the improved seed propagation areas have organized power-driven ginneries to gin cotton for farmers. This has played a significant role in concentrating and maintaining improved seeds.

Although some achievements have been made in the propagation and promotion of improved varieties in the past two years, there are still phenomena of cotton seed mixing and degradation in some areas. Governments at all levels and improved cotton experimental research institutions have begun to pay attention and plan to organize inspection teams this autumn to conduct in-depth inspections of the degree of mixing and degradation and their causes, in order to study how to overcome this phenomenon.

    全国两年来推广棉花良种获得成绩
    两年来，各级人民政府在棉花良种繁殖推广工作上，已有显著的成绩。良种推广的结果，棉田的平均单位面积产量提高了，棉花的品质也提高了。
    一九五○年，全国各地才开始有计划地进行棉花良种繁殖和推广工作。一九四九年，棉花良棉种植面积只占棉田面积的百分之十点七，一九五○年良种面积已占棉田面积百分之十九，一九五一年已占百分之二十八点八，到今年已占全国棉田面积的一半了。两年来良种棉田比一九四九年增加了八九倍。在两三年内棉田良种就能普及全国。在增加产量上：良种棉比一般棉每亩平均增产百分之十以上。河北省一九五一年良种繁殖区平均每亩比一般棉区增产百分之四十三；良种推广区平均每亩比一般棉区增产百分之十四点八。山西省临汾良种繁殖区平均每亩产籽棉一百二十斤，一般棉区仅产九十斤。一九五一年推广的良棉面积，若以增产百分之十计算，去年即增产皮棉七十多万担。由于大量推广良种，棉花品质也显著提高了，首先是粗绒棉花相对的逐年减少。全国范围内一九五○年粗绒棉生产量约占总生产量百分之二十六，一九五一年即占百分之二十一点六了（由于粗绒棉有其一定优性，二年来面积也有增加，但比例是相对的减少）。其次在纤维长度上也有改进。如华北区一九四九年绒长十六分之十五吋及其以上的棉花，占总产量的百分之十，十六分之十三吋及其以下的占百分之五十一；而一九五一年绒长十六分之十五吋及其以上的棉花，占总产量的百分之二十九，十六分之十三吋及其以下的占百分之二十七点五。由于长纤维棉产量增加，纺纱的效率也提高了。如华北区有的纱厂纺中支纱，原用三十二分之二十五吋的原棉，二十小时每锭产纱零点九磅，改用三十二分之二十七吋的原棉后，二十小时每锭产纱达一点○五磅，而且纱的拉力也增强很多。山东推广的五爱棉，绒长而整齐，可纺六十支细纱，这在过去的国棉中是没有的。由于良种产量高、品质好，因此，农民都喜爱优良棉种。平原省堂邑县农民以斯字二比棉种做为馈赠亲友的珍贵礼品。
    两年来人民政府为达到普及良棉，曾在技术上和经济上大力扶助农民。全国各棉区都设有良种繁殖区，这种繁殖区在全国的总面积达二百五十万亩。主要的推广方法是发动农民选种和互相换种。平原、山东等地农民，以良种馈赠亲友，是推广的最好的方法。两年来，各良种繁殖区并成立有专业机构，经常派技术干部下乡指导。各地合作社对推广棉花良种，也有极大的贡献。为了防止良种的混杂和流失，各良种繁殖区组织了动力轧花厂，代农民轧棉。这对集中和保持良种起了很大作用。
    两年来良种繁殖推广工作虽然获得了一些成绩，但目前有些地区还有棉种混杂和退化现象，各级人民政府和良棉试验研究机构已开始注意，并计划今年秋季组织检查组，深入检查混杂退化程度及其原因，以便研究克服这种现象。（新华社）
