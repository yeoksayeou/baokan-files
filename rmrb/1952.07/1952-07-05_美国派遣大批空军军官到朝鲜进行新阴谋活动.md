Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 4th: After the savage bombing of the Yalu River power plant, the American aggressors have dispatched a large number of important Air Force officers to Korea to carry out new conspiracy activities.

According to American news agencies, a group of important American Air Force officers, led by the Under Secretary of the Air Force, Gilpatric, and the Acting Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, Twining, arrived in Korea on June 30th. Their mission and activities are extremely secret. The six main generals in this group can almost represent every major department of the Air Force—command, operations, intelligence, materials, planning, and personnel. Among these Air Force officers is also Truman's Air Force aide-de-camp, Robert Landry.

After holding a series of secret meetings with senior US military generals in Korea and quietly visiting the important US Air Force base on Okinawa, the American officers left Tokyo for the United States on the 2nd. On the very same day, Van Fleet, the commander of the Eighth Army of the US invading forces in Korea, clamored in Seoul, saying: "I hope to see a great increase in our air force activity."

The sneaky activities of the senior American Air Force officers and Van Fleet's clamoring show that the American aggressors are planning new military conspiracies. The Korean and Chinese People's forces are closely watching this American conspiracy.

    美国派遣大批空军军官到朝鲜进行新阴谋活动
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】美国侵略者在野蛮地轰炸了鸭绿江发电厂以后，又派遣了大批重要的空军军官到朝鲜来进行新的阴谋活动。
    据美国通讯社透露，由美国空军部副部长吉尔巴特里克与美国空军代理参谋长特文宁率领的一批重要的美国空军军官，于六月三十日抵达朝鲜。他们的任务和活动极为秘密。这一批人中间的六个主要将领几乎可以代表空军中每一个主要部门——指挥、作战、情报、材料、计划及人事。这些空军军官中并有杜鲁门的空军侍从武官罗柏·兰德利在内。
    吉尔巴特里克等在和侵朝美军高级将领进行了一连串秘密会议，并悄悄地到美国在远东的重要空军基地冲绳岛一行以后，已于二日离东京返美。就在这一天，侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在汉城叫嚣说：“我希望看见我们的空军活动大大增加。”
    美国高级空军军官的鬼鬼祟祟的活动，和范佛里特的叫嚣，说明了美国侵略者正在布置军事上的新阴谋。朝中人民部队正密切注意美国的这个阴谋。
