Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 9th: During the special meeting of the World Peace Council, our agency's reporter interviewed representatives from Asian countries. They are: Han Xueye from Korea, Yang Bailian from Vietnam, Anand from India, Kawamura Kazuo from Japan, Zeng Xuehong from Malaya, Suyono Nikoro from Indonesia, Cruz from the Philippines, ?Basae Sa Sunthorn from Thailand, and Saranankara from Ceylon. They answered the reporter's questions as follows:

Question: What are your impressions of the special meeting of the World Peace Council? In your opinion, what is the significance of this meeting for promoting world peace?

Zeng Xuehong said: The current world situation requires such a special meeting. Yang Bailian said: The separate treaties concluded with Japan and West Germany, the protracted Korean armistice negotiations, and bacteriological warfare constitute a serious threat to world peace. Convening this meeting fully accords with the deep aspirations of the people of all countries in the world. Han Xueye said: This meeting thoroughly exposed the crimes of the US imperialists in massacring people on a large scale, mistreating and slaughtering prisoners of war, indiscriminately bombing towns and villages and peaceful facilities, and using bacteriological weapons in an extremely barbaric manner in front of the people of the whole world. It issued a warning to the people of the world, but at the same time it inspired the fighting spirit of peace fighters. Kawamura Kazuo said: This meeting proved that the warmongers cannot intimidate the people of all countries in the world. The meeting called on the people of all countries to unite more closely and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Japanese and German questions. The meeting also encouraged the people of Japan and Germany to fight for peace and independence. Anand said: The agenda of the meeting involves the fundamental issues of the current tasks of peace fighters around the world. I am most concerned about the Japanese question, because the re-militarization of Japan is a serious threat to the people of all Asian countries, including the Japanese people. The Americans are using Japan as a base for aggression in the Far East and are now threatening peace in Asia, especially the Soviet Union and China, which played a major role in defeating Japanese militarism. I am convinced that the Asian people will unite to repel this danger together.

Question: Do you think that the recent deliberate actions of the US government to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and attempt to expand the war are a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world?

Their answers were all affirmative. Han Xueye said: The US imperialists are trying to expand the war by all means, and they are instigating a third world war. Kawamura Kazuo said: The Americans are plotting new war schemes somewhere in Asia, for example, in Southeast Asia, and if possible, they also want to use the help of a re-militarized Japan. If the people of all Asian countries, including the Japanese people, do not work together to thoroughly expose and stop this conspiracy, peace in Asia will inevitably be undermined. Anand said: The people of Asia and the people of all countries in the world are increasingly aware of the serious threat they face.

Question: Facing the dangerous situation, what measures are your people taking to prevent war? What new developments are there in the peace movement in your country?

Yang Bailian said: The Vietnamese people actively participated in the preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. In factories and villages, they are discussing the declaration of the preparatory meeting. They closely combine the struggle to defend world peace with the liberation war against French colonialists. Anand said: Despite constant American propaganda, the Indian peace movement has grown stronger than it was a year ago. More and more ordinary people know that they must unite to engage in the struggle to defend peace. More prominent figures have joined the peace movement. We will hold an All-India Peace Conference before the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is convened. Kawamura Kazuo said: The Japanese people's struggle for independence is focused on these demands: "Abolish the two war treaties (referring to the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan Security Treaty), American devils go home, overthrow the Yoshida government, do not interfere in Korea, strive for a comprehensive peace treaty." The four general strikes before and after the entry into force of the two war treaties show the fighting courage and strength of the Japanese people. Suyono Nikoro said: The Indonesian people's peace movement is growing. Action committees have been established in Medan and Jakarta. Zeng Xuehong said: The people of Malaya deeply know that they can only live in peace after they have achieved national independence. The Malayan people's national liberation struggle against British imperialism is a struggle for peace. The Malayan people are willing to resolve the Malayan war through peaceful negotiations on the basis of national self-determination and the withdrawal of foreign troops. They are doing their best to fight for this future, and at the same time hope that peace-loving people all over the world, especially the British people, will support this reasonable demand. Cruz said: The Philippine peace movement is operating underground, but the people have never stopped their struggle and are giving direct blows to the warmongers.

Question: What are your expectations for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing this autumn?

Han Xueye said: This peace conference is a new step in the peace movement to defeat the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war in Asia. It will clearly point out to the warmongers that the power of the people's unity will surely defeat all aggressive attempts by foreign aggressors against Asia. Kawamura Kazuo said: The Japanese people's expectation for this peace conference is: to hope that all the people in the Asian and Pacific region will fully support the Japanese people's demand for a comprehensive peace treaty, because this is the only way to peacefully resolve the Japanese question. ?Basae Sa Sunthorn said: I hope that this conference will be a great encouragement to all colonial and semi-colonial peoples who are fighting for peace and national independence. Saranankara said: This conference will be a very successful conference. It will unite all the people in the Asian and Pacific region to jointly oppose the warmongers.

    亚洲各国出席世界和平理事会特别会议代表答新华社记者问
    【新华社柏林九日电】在世界和平理事会特别会议期间，本社记者访问了亚洲国家的代表。他们是：朝鲜的韩雪野，越南的杨白莲，印度的安纳德，日本的河村一夫，马来亚的曾雪虹，印度尼西亚的苏约尼哥罗，菲律宾的柯鲁兹，泰国的?巴色·飒顺吞，锡兰的撒拉南卡拉。他们对记者提出的问题答复如下：
    问：你对世界和平理事会特别会议的印象如何？在你看来，这次会议对于促进世界和平有什么意义？
    曾雪虹说：当前的世界局势需要召开这样一次特别会议。杨白莲说：与日本和西德缔结的单独条约、朝鲜停战谈判的旷日持久和细菌战，构成了对世界和平的严重威胁。召开这次会议完全符合世界各国人民的深切愿望。韩雪野说：这次会议在全世界人民面前彻底揭穿了美帝国主义者大批屠杀人民、虐待和屠杀战俘、滥炸城镇乡村与和平设施、和极野蛮地使用细菌武器的罪行。它向全世界人民提出了一个警告，但同时也鼓舞了和平战士的战斗精神。河村一夫说：这次会议证明了战争贩子吓不倒世界各国人民。会议号召各国人民更加团结起来，争取和平解决日本和德国问题。会议同时也鼓舞了日本和德国人民争取和平与独立的斗争。安纳德说：会议议程所涉及的，是全世界和平战士当前任务的根本问题。我最关心日本问题，因为日本的重新军国主义化是对亚洲各国人民的严重威胁，包括日本人民在内。美国人利用日本作为远东的侵略基地，现在正威胁着亚洲的和平，特别是威胁着在击败日本军国主义方面起了主要作用的苏联和中国。我深信亚洲人民将团结起来共同打退这种危险。
    问：你认为美国政府最近蓄意拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判以及力图扩大战争的行动是对亚洲和全世界和平的严重威胁吗？
    他们的答复都是肯定的。韩雪野说：美帝国主义者正在力图用一切办法扩大战争，他们正在煽动第三次世界大战。河村一夫说：美国人正在亚洲某地策动新的战争阴谋，举例说，如像在东南亚，如果可能的话，他们并想利用重新军国主义化了的日本的帮助。如果亚洲各国人民，包括日本人民在内，不一致努力彻底揭穿并制止这种阴谋，亚洲的和平就必然要受到破坏。安纳德说：亚洲人民和全世界各国人民正愈来愈认清了他们面临的严重威胁。
    问：面临着危险的局势，贵国人民正在采取什么措施以防止战争？贵国国内的和平运动有些什么新发展？
    杨白莲说：越南人民积极参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作。在工厂和乡村里，他们正在讨论筹备会议的宣言。他们把保卫世界和平的斗争和反对法国殖民主义者的解放战争紧密地结合起来。安纳德说：尽管美国的不断宣传，印度和平运动已比一年以前壮大了。愈来愈多的老百姓知道必须团结起来从事保卫和平的斗争。更多的著名人士参加了和平运动。我们将在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开之前举行全印和平会议。河村一夫说：日本人民争取独立的斗争集中在这些要求上面：“废除两个战争条约（按指单独对日和约和日美安全条约），美国鬼子回国去，打倒吉田政府，不干涉朝鲜，争取全面和约。”两个战争条约生效前后的一连四次总罢工，说明了日本人民的斗争勇气和力量。苏约尼哥罗说：印度尼西亚人民的和平运动正在壮大中。在棉兰和雅加达都已成立了行动委员会。曾雪虹说：马来亚人民深深知道，他们只有取得了民族独立之后，才能过和平的生活。马来亚人民反对英帝国主义的民族解放斗争，就是争取和平的斗争。马来亚人民愿意在民族自决和外国军队撤退的基础上，以和平谈判的方式，解决马来亚的战争。他们在尽力为争取这个前途而斗争，同时并希望全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是英国人民，支持这个合理的要求。柯鲁兹说：菲律宾的和平运动是在地下活动的，但是人民从来没有停止他们的斗争，并给战争贩子以直接的打击。
    问：你对于今年秋天在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议有什么期望？
    韩雪野说：这次和平会议是和平运动打败美帝国主义者扩大亚洲战争阴谋的一个新的步骤。它将向战争贩子清楚地指出，人民团结一致的力量，一定能打败外国侵略者对亚洲的一切侵略企图。河村一夫说：日本人民对这次和平会议的期望是：希望亚洲和太平洋区域全体人民全力支持日本人民对全面和约的要求，因为这才是和平解决日本问题的唯一办法。?巴色·飒顺吞说：我希望，这次会议将是对全体正在为和平与民族独立而战斗的殖民地和半殖民地人民的巨大鼓舞。撒拉南卡拉说：这次会议将会是一次非常成功的会议。它将把亚洲和太平洋区域的全体人民团结起来，共同反对战争贩子。
