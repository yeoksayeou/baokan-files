    New Records on the Production Front
    Ji Shuanghai Group of Fengfeng Coal Mine Creates New Record, Drilling 41.95 Meters in a Day
    After learning the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi group, the Zhang Zhaoyi drilling group of Fengfeng Mining Bureau improved their drilling progress day by day and soon created a new record of 26.3 meters per day. Later, the Zhang Zhaoyi group also actively united with the Wei Fenggui and Zhang Quan groups, who were in the same shift, to study together. While welcoming the anniversary of the Party's founding, the Ji Shuanghai group of this shift created a new record of drilling 41.95 meters in 24 hours. (Shi Shuye)
    Wang Zhande and Other Two Groups of Datong Coal Mine Continuously Set New Records for Rapid Tunneling
    Wang Zhande and Liu Shouren groups of the Ma Liu Hai Tunneling Team of Datong Mining Bureau continuously set new tunneling records while welcoming the anniversary of the Party's founding. The Wang Zhande group further studied the deep-hole operation method and also learned the four-and-a-half-hole cycle operation method improved by the Zhang Zhishun group of their mine on the basis of the two-and-a-half-hole cycle operation method. On June 26, one shift tunneled 46 meters. On June 27, the Liu Shouren group used the same method and tunneled 56.4 meters in one shift. (Ma Liang)
    Lu Hanzhang Group of Hegang Mining Bureau Creates New Record, Drilling 41 Meters in a Day
    The Lu Hanzhang drilling group of the 150-meter drilling rig of Hegang Mining Bureau recently created a new record of drilling 41 meters per day. The drilled strata are sandstone, sandy shale, and gravelly sandstone, with 14.3 meters of coal visible, and a hole depth of more than 109 meters. The Lu Hanzhang group learned the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi group. In addition to accelerating the rotation speed of the drilling rig and implementing rapid drilling, they also tried to do a good job in preparation work in all aspects, shortening the auxiliary operation time and extending the drilling time. Now their actual drilling time has been extended from an average of 12 hours in the past to 17 hours and 20 minutes, and the auxiliary operation time has been shortened from an average of 12 hours to 6 hours and 40 minutes.

    生产战线上的新纪录
    峰峰煤矿姬双海小组创新纪录钻探日进四十一点九五公尺
    峰峰矿务局张照义钻探小组学习了马文志小组的先进经验后，钻进进度日益提高，不久就创造了日进二六点三公尺的新纪录。以后，张照义小组又主动地团结了和他们一个圆班的韦凤贵和张全两个小组共同学习。在迎接党的生日时，这个圆班的姬双海小组创造了二十四小时钻进四十一点九五公尺的最高新纪录。    （史书业）
    大同煤矿王占德等两小组连创快速掘进最高新纪录
    大同矿务局马六孩掘进队的王占德和刘守仁小组，在迎接党的生日时，连创掘进最高纪录。王占德小组进一步研究了深孔作业法，同时学习了他们矿张志顺小组在两个半孔道循环作业的基础上改进的四个半孔道循环作业法，在六月二十六日，一个圆班掘进了四十六公尺。六月二十七日刘守仁小组采用同样办法，一个圆班掘进了五十六点四公尺。

    鹤岗矿务局吕翰章小组创新纪录钻探日进四十一公尺
    鹤岗矿务局一百五十公尺钻机吕翰章钻探小组，最近创造了日进四十一公尺的新纪录。钻探的地层是砂岩、砂页岩和砾质砂岩，内见煤十四点三公尺，孔深一○九公尺多。吕翰章小组学习了马文志小组的先进经验，除了加快钻机转数，实行快速钻进外，又从各方面设法做好准备工作，缩短了辅助作业时间，延长了钻进时间。现在他们的实际钻进时间已由过去的平均十二小时延长到十七小时二十分，辅助作业时间由平均十二小时缩短到六小时四十分。    （鹤岗矿务局办公室）
