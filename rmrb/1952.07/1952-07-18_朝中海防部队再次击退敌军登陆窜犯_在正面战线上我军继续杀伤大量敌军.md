Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 17th: The coastal defense forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, guarding the coastline, repelled another enemy landing attempt on the west coast on the 14th of this month. On that day, more than 300 of the Li Syngman bandit troops, aboard eight motorized junks and under the cover of aircraft and naval gunfire, attempted to land at Gamsu, southeast of Monggeumpo-ri, Ongjin Peninsula. Our coastal defense forces immediately repelled this seaborne enemy force, inflicting over 50 casualties. In June, our coastal defense forces had repelled four enemy landing attempts in this area.

On the main battlefront, our forces continued to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy in blocking and counter-attacking battles. On a height south of Goseong on the eastern front, from late on the 10th to the early morning of the 14th, our forces completely annihilated an enemy company with courageous action, and repelled dozens of frenzied counterattacks by an enemy platoon to a battalion in size, inflicting more than 1,380 casualties on the enemy. At 3:00 AM on the 14th, an enemy company on the western front attacked a height north of Cheorwon, and retreated after suffering more than 50 casualties.

    朝中海防部队再次击退敌军登陆窜犯
    在正面战线上我军继续杀伤大量敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】守卫海防线的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的海防部队，本月十四日又在西海岸击退了敌军的一次登陆窜犯。这天李匪军三百多名乘着八只机帆船，在飞机和军舰炮火的掩护下，向瓮津半岛梦金浦里东南甘水等地作登陆窜犯。我海防部队当即击退这股来自海上的敌军，杀伤其五十多名。在六月份中，我军海防部队在这个地区曾先后击退敌军四次登陆窜扰。
    在正面战线上，我军在阻击和反击战中继续杀伤大量敌军。在东线高城以南的一个高地上，自十日深夜到十四日清晨，我军以勇猛动作全歼敌军一个连，并打退敌军一个排到一个营的数十次疯狂反扑，杀伤敌军一千三百八十多名。十四日三时，西线敌军一个连向铁原以北的一个高地攻击，被杀伤五十多名后败退。
